beneficence is not enough

07:39.826 --> 07:41.495
to Miss Miller,

07:42.087 --> 07:46.967
She has a feeling that it will all trifle
Available time, willingly.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.304
You think this is some kind of game,

07:50.345 --> 07:52.973
and you have nothing better to
do with my time,

07:53.473 --> 07:57.477
but to stand here and learn your seniors,
English literature.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.396

striving towards it.

43:42.539 --> 43:46.835

43:47.461 --> 43:48.913
specify Breda to sit on the bed and

43:48.937 --> 43:50.230

45:31.648 --> 45:34.193
- Where are your seats?
- Chairs?

45:35.527 --> 45:41.450
We are renovating, so I guess we'll
sit on the bed.

45:52.461 --> 45:55.464
Where are the chairs?

45:55.506 --> 45:58.946
It does not matter, get out and leave us or
you're gonna have a pet food for breakfast.

46:14.441 --> 46:15.776
I think you'd like this.

46:18.946 --> 46:22.950
Where are the chairs.
I've moved it so I could be trained.

47:18.755 --> 47:22.342
Do not ask. And do not even think to ask.

47:31.185 --> 47:36.690
Listen Can I talk to you for a minute?
I have to apologize for a few things.

47:37.608 --> 47:40.861

47:40.903 --> 47:44.198
Well, at first I did not need to let
house with David, he is very arrogant.

47:44.865 --> 47:49.036
He's harmless.
I told him to wear and he was gone.

47:53.165 --> 47:56.335
In any case, I appreciate helping me
about literature.

47:57.920 --> 48:01.173
You know I find it very difficult

48:02.299 --> 48:05.344

48:05.886 --> 48:08.766
Randy decides each day what am I going
to wear, where we will have lunch.

48:09.890 --> 48:13.852
You know, why are you going with it?
I think it is so superior.

48:15.270 --> 48:17.430
Every guy wants to go with
most popular girl in school.

48:18.065 --> 48:21.109
- Popularity is a very low price, is not it?
- Then what.

48:23.862 --> 48:28.116
Here we learn that we are not to speak.
Why we are predicting a period of learning.

48:29.785 --> 48:32.204
No, no, no let me, let me.

49:43.233 --> 49:46.195
OK Viver, to see
how do you like being a toy.

49:50.991 --> 49:54.328
What is the internal conflict

49:54.369 --> 49:57.706
that is inserted Hamlet in this act.

49:58.498 --> 50:01.960
Does anyone know?
Nagovesticu your students.

50:03.170 --> 50:07.049
Some of you may have
experience with this problem

50:07.090 --> 50:10.928
if your parents are divorced.

50:13.597 --> 50:16.808
It's a crisis of adolescence

50:18.936 --> 50:24.441
Hamlet asked regarding 2 issues
his loyalty...

50:26.193 --> 50:30.656
Do you think that it is very sticky here
bit.

50:31.657 --> 50:35.077
Will someone open window?

50:38.163 --> 50:41.416
And what is gained as Hamlet answers?

50:43.919 --> 50:46.255
Does he share an opinion with me about
heat?

50:49.258 --> 50:54.555
The question that we are waiting for
detraction is... What is Hamlet got a deal?

50:55.973 --> 51:00.102
He's manly idiots!

51:02.396 --> 51:05.816
What is it you people?!
He's manly!

When a little rest will be
all right, believe me.

Are you okay Vivero?!

51:47.191 --> 51:48.192

51:53.447 --> 51:57.367
How Rica could have done this?
Much has worked on this doll.

52:44.998 --> 52:48.043
It's very impressive, very impressive...
Of course I want to pay my wash.

52:48.752 --> 52:52.381

- So let it be for severe polishing.

52:56.718 --> 52:58.470

53:08.313 --> 53:09.773
Yes! Celi amount!

53:10.941 --> 53:14.862
And even more twisted thing is that
I bought a ticket at all.

53:14.903 --> 53:18.866
I received a post and when I
opened there was a ticket.

53:19.825 --> 53:21.786
And then I realized that
I have a lot of abandoned

53:21.810 --> 53:23.270
lately.

53:23.328 --> 53:26.790
That's why I bought a whole new wardrobe.
What about your hair?

53:27.207 --> 53:32.129
You like?
- Are you kidding? Look at you. You're a natural cutie!

53:32.880 --> 53:34.506
Oh, so I do not know.

53:36.466 --> 53:40.512
Anyway...
I met a wonderful èoveka.

53:41.972 --> 53:45.642
Actually he is Argentinean Count,
Armando Lagando.

53:47.269 --> 53:50.272
Do not tell anyone but
taking a lengthy sabbatical!

53:51.315 --> 53:53.233
- Well, it was high time.

53:55.110 --> 53:57.029
Another wonderful thing.

53:57.070 --> 54:00.470

other places I can not remember the name.

54:32.147 --> 54:36.527
How did you managed?
- You know I wanted someone with a brain, you know.

54:37.194 --> 54:39.530
Give them time, men
are like other species,

54:39.571 --> 54:41.907
very difficult to go through this.

54:42.741 --> 54:45.452
Take for example the Order.
Order?

54:46.453 --> 54:49.164
Kambole? Love 3333.

54:49.957 --> 54:52.668
You think that's weird is not it?

54:52.709 --> 54:55.420
Well, not exactly my type
but I think he's cute.

54:56.296 --> 54:58.882
That is very sweet and spicy,

54:58.924 --> 55:01.552
I heard it once on the glass
and has the sweetest moves.

55:02.261 --> 55:03.929
I assume you two are
made for each other.

55:23.866 --> 55:25.746
- Why do not you tell him?
- I'm not interested.

55:27.327 --> 55:28.579
Oh, my God.

55:36.128 --> 55:39.840
Is he kidding? I'm so ashamed.

55:41.383 --> 55:42.718
Look at it as funky.

55:47.723 --> 55:48.891
He'll never be so hippie.

57:04.007 --> 57:05.007
Æao Serena.

57:05.133 --> 57:08.345
What is it? Avenger venom
makes for good looks or what?

57:09.513 --> 57:12.432
- This is a stew.
- I'm sorry...

57:13.350 --> 57:17.312
You're very radiant, now that is poison
did stvoje eating out of your hand, right?

57:18.522 --> 57:20.941
- I could not do that.
- Thanx but what could.

57:21.859 --> 57:24.194
Do not you see? I do not want
to throw at it seems.

57:30.492 --> 57:33.328
Deca, never satisfied.

57:33.829 --> 57:38.959
One more thing.
I want to look like her.

57:41.670 --> 57:43.505
It looks like a ruin does well.

57:44.673 --> 57:47.634
Come on Serena listen,

57:47.676 --> 57:50.679
May I say that I will be
heartbreaker when I grow up but

57:51.180 --> 57:53.891
I'm ready now.
I'm tired of the mode.

to be applied

58:00.289 --> 58:01.665
to a lot of people.

58:02.357 --> 58:04.610

are large enough to do so.

58:05.485 --> 58:07.325
Well, you gonna help me do not you?
Do not you?

58:22.669 --> 58:25.297
The most popular girl.

58:32.471 --> 58:37.684
Cleopatra, Mary Antoneta,
Merlin Monro and...

58:40.145 --> 58:43.690
No, no...
Let's see what we got here.

58:45.275 --> 58:49.321

pull something. Yes? Yes.

58:52.866 --> 58:55.536

59:00.249 --> 59:01.458
Please sit down.

59:04.753 --> 59:07.172
I never thought
I'll do this for anyone.

59:09.132 --> 59:12.386
What is it?

59:12.427 --> 59:15.722
My last power that I kept
for myself, when I'm in the ice age.

59:16.723 --> 59:17.850
Oh Serena.

59:27.484 --> 59:29.027
It! That's it!

59:32.239 --> 59:36.577
OK.

59:36.618 --> 59:40.956
You need a piece of her clothes
and one of her poems

59:42.499 --> 59:45.961
sprinkle it all over you,

59:46.003 --> 59:49.464
and turn it exactly 13 times in 15 min
before midnight counter clockwise.

59:50.174 --> 59:51.508
I repeat this...

59:59.975 --> 01:00:02.345
Luiz are you crazy?
How do you see that accident and Sonu?

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:03.369

Luiz baby that
is the difference?

01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.732
The difference is that we do not want
to stop loving me.

01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:55.112
- It happens with and without magic.
- No if love was right.

01:09:55.654 --> 01:09:58.574
Falling in love is the only
a sham in any case.

01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:01.493
The real brilliance, music, hairstyles.

01:10:03.161 --> 01:10:06.373
People fall in love and then you
one day everything ends.

01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:11.211
When my Ijubio is it

01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:16.675

It sounds too
depressant believe.

01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:22.764
When some people fall in love
this love remain forever.

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:24.765
Æao Luiz.

01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:27.728

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:01.845

01:11:02.846 --> 01:11:04.973

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.490
So much noise that

01:12:04.116 --> 01:12:06.660
Hurry up girls,
and do not say happy.

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:10.873
- Why not?
- Call it superstition.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:16.170

01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:04.760

01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:19.775
Yeah, I guess.

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:24.196
It's like when you really
need someone to remind

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.698

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:31.995
You know honey is not important at all
that and other people see,

01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:36.291
but it is very important
how you see yourself.

01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:40.169
Thank you Dad.

01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:51.722

Believed me or not
we care about you.

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:30.220
You do not have to play.

01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:35.601
- You've become what you've become and left me in a dark bar!
- Poli...

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:39.688

01:15:34.284 --> 01:15:35.661
Is our son started to take drugs?

So it is hard to be a popular girl.
I thought it would me happy. Is not it?

01:17:20.724 --> 01:17:21.850
Are for short.

01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:26.855
But in the end...
I know what you mean.

01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:29.351
You know sometimes you wonder
who the real me friends.

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:32.653
I became captain
the team since grade 6.

01:17:32.694 --> 01:17:35.113
What if I go to the next
college to start over?

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:38.158
- It does not matter.
- How do you know?

01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:44.540
Bred you've got a lot of good quality and you will not need to be worried about football.
- You think?
