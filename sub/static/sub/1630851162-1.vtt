00:07.120 --> 00:09.320
Young man: A few Jelly Babies
and some licorice.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.520
Give us a few of those
pearly ones, please.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.680
Man: Hey, let's go.Take that with you.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.960
Keep the change.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.400
He's in there
by the car.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.360
Check out the shades.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.800
You grab a coffee.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.240
I won't be long.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.640
Go on, boss.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.720
Good to see you, Frank.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.440
You know there's cops down there
in the car park taking snaps?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.400
Yeah, they've been camped out
there since Eamon arrived.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.360
Fuck 'em.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.280
Frank.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.240
You want something to drink?Eh, no.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.320
I'm grand.
Thanks, though.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.720
Get him a whiskey, John.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.200
Neat. Thanks.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.720
John says you've been
having some grief.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.520
Yeah.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.920
One of your lads,

03:19.960 --> 03:22.600
Caolan Moore,
has been encroaching.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.040
He's young, enthusiastic.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.320
You remember
what that was like?

03:27.360 --> 03:29.920
Well, he burned out
two of our dealers.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.120
And I can't have that,
Eamon.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.880
Look, Caolan gets
all of his product from me.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.680
He's not using other
suppliers -- not like you do.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.640
I have to repay loyalty
with loyalty.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.920
You and I have been
doing business

03:43.960 --> 03:45.360
since before
Moore was born,

03:45.400 --> 03:49.880
and no one shifts as much
product for you as we do.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.320
It's not personal, Frank.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.600
It's just
the model's changing.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.600
You're either all in with me
or you're not.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.600
Anthony: Mam?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.320
I'm getting dressed.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.880
Da just rang.
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.640
Thanks.
I'll be down in a sec.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.160
Jimmy: Michael?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
Michael.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.040
Yeah.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.880
You alright, bro?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.160
Yeah, grand.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.360
Birdy,
I got food earlier.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.800
It's all in the fridge.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.680
Ah, it's not party food,
though.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.160
You need
proper party food.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.960
Itsy-bitsies, like.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.520
Anthony.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.800
Anthony: Yeah?

05:27.840 --> 05:30.800
Come here.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.080
Take these upstairs.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.560
Alright.And put a shirt on.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.880
Now?No, next week.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.800
Eric, not here
in front of Jamie.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.320
What?
All gone now.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.880
And you
shouldn't be drinking.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.280
He's 17.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.360
Ma.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.600
Lord Jesus.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.880
Jesus Christ.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.800
Guess where
I was today.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.240
Alcoholics Anonymous?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.440
Ha.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.880
Your school.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.400
Ex-school.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.040
Not anymore.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.440
They're giving you
another chance.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.600
You're back Monday.[Laughs]

06:09.640 --> 06:11.640
I told you --
I don't want to go back there.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.320
Too bad.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.800
So, anyway, we're going to
that club later,

06:14.840 --> 06:16.320
so you should just come.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
Yeah. Sweet.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.880
Fuck it.That's not happening.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.760
Why not?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.360
Introduce him to one of Nikki's
mates, give him his hold.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.280
Eric.
What?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.120
He knows it doesn't matter
who it is the first time.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.440
Just fucking
throw it in there.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.800
Eric, stop being
a fucking idiot.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.120
What you think?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.360
I think some people
are all mouth.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
Exactly. Yeah.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.160
Birdy: They're here.Shh.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.520
They're here.
Come on.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.280
Should we hide and jump out,
or what?

06:41.320 --> 06:42.600
It's not a fucking
surprise party.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.760
He knows
we're gonna be here.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.640
Shh.
Everyone, come on.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.760
Ah.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.360
Hope you got your drinking
boots on, Michael.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.520
I can't believe he's here.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.440
Oh, Anthony -- Oh, look at you.
You look gorgeous.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.880
You made an effort --
Look at him.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.480
Yeah?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.640
Whoo-hoo!

07:42.680 --> 07:43.880
Welcome home, pet.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.280
Ah, thanks, Auntie Birdy.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.840
Whatever they were feeding you
in there, you look well on it.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.680
In there -- Yeah.
It's probably a diet of cock.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.200
Welcome home, man.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.000
How's it going, Eric?This is Nikita.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.840
Hi.I've heard
loads about you.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.200
Some good, I hope.Of course, it's good.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.440
Jimmy: Jamie, Anthony,
say hello to Uncle Michael.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.800
How are you?No, yeah. Yeah, I know.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.080
Big, aren't they?

08:04.120 --> 08:05.360
Nice to see you.Nice to see you.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.800
Jamie, bigger than me now.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.400
You're not gonna say
hi to Michael?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.040
I will. I am.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.480
Hey.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.200
You look well, anyway.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.680
How's it going?Yeah. Grand.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.280
It's great you're back.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.760
Thanks.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.800
Birdy: Come and have
a bit of food, Mikey.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.600
Take that jacket off,
will you?

08:29.280 --> 08:30.360
Eh, I'll get that.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.160
They here yet?He just arrived.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.320
Amanda.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.760
Frank: Hey!

08:51.800 --> 08:53.520
Sorry I'm late, Mikey.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.840
No worries.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.600
Good to see you out
and staying out.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.600
We'll see to that.
Hey, do you remember this fella?

08:58.640 --> 08:59.880
Hi, Dotser.How are you, Mike?

08:59.920 --> 09:02.360
Good.
Hey, bro, take one.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.120
Ah, no,
I'm alright for now.You sure?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.760
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, though.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.160
Well, come on.
I have something to show you.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.120
Now?
Yeah.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.680
I'll get some drinks for you.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.480
Eh, Jamie come help me.
-Oh, yeah, get me one.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.480
G&T, yeah?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.480
What happened, Jimmy?
Your snakes win the lotto?

09:25.520 --> 09:29.640
Yeah. Long way from a plastic
box under the bed, is it?

09:29.680 --> 09:31.640
You remember Cyndi?

09:32.840 --> 09:36.360
[Laughs] Yeah.
Oh, man.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.160
I used to torment you
with her.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.120
You know, eh, Birdy bought
some stuff for the house.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.840
Sheets, towels.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.760
Some clothes for you.[Drawer opens]

09:47.800 --> 09:52.360
It's all in there.Great.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.160
You know you can always
crash here with us, yeah?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.400
I'm not sure that's
a long-term solution.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.040
Yeah, I'm just saying.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.280
You don't have to live there
if you don't want to.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.600
You can stay with us
as long as you want.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.520
I'll be grand.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
You sure?

10:08.600 --> 10:11.640
Yeah.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.080
Okay.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.560
Thanks, brother.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.560
You wanna hold her?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.040
No.
Okay.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.640
So?

10:33.680 --> 10:35.800
What's the story?

10:35.840 --> 10:38.800
I, eh -- I spoke to Eamon about
the shit with Caolan Moore.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.280
Yeah? And?

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
He's gonna sort it.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.440
Yeah?
How, exactly?

10:45.480 --> 10:48.080
He'll have a word with Moore,
put a stop to it.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.080
Are we gonna be compensated
for the stash houses he torched?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.080
Just leave it, will ya?
It's fucking done now.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.320
You know how much
we're out of pocket

10:53.360 --> 10:56.080
'cause of him?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.840
He's laughing at us, Da.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.840
He's fucking laughing
at us.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.640
He's going around
and he's telling everyone

11:01.680 --> 11:03.120
he's with Eamon Cunningham

11:03.160 --> 11:04.320
and he can do
whatever the fuck he wants.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.840
He'll be told what's what,
and that'll set'll it.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.920
Yeah,
'til the next time.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.200
He'll ease off
for a while,

11:09.240 --> 11:10.840
and then he'll be back
acting the bollix again.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.120
Just fucking drop it,
will ya?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.840
Why are you
so fucking weak?

11:14.880 --> 11:16.040
You're making us all
look bad.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.120
I'm using
my fucking head!

11:18.160 --> 11:19.560
You might want to try
that yourself sometime.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.040
Bending over,
taking it up the arse?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.320
That's using your head,
is it?

11:22.360 --> 11:23.440
Yeah, you just keep that up,
I'll put your head

11:23.480 --> 11:24.920
through
that fucking window!

11:29.200 --> 11:32.600
Why do you never listen
to anything I have to say?

11:32.640 --> 11:34.360
'Cause you're a fucking
embarrassment.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.840
Fuck this.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.920
Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.080
Jimmy, I don't want to pet
your snake, alright?

11:49.120 --> 11:52.440
What?Do we have to do this
every time we have visitors?

11:52.480 --> 11:55.760
Baby, people pay to see
these bad boys at the zoo.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.320
People love snakes,
am I right?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.120
Nikki, we're leaving.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.440
Yes, Your Majesty.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.960
Eh?Are you leaving already?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.160
But you've hardly even
seen Mikey.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.400
Let him fucking go.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.640
Hey, stay. Stay.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.160
Stop being such
a fucking baby, Eric.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.240
Shut the fuck up.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.440
Waaaah.
Aww.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.240
[Laughs] Waah.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.800
Blimey.
Welcome home, Michael.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.600
Can I get you another
sparkling water or something?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.360
Actually, I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.920
Ah, what?

12:26.960 --> 12:28.160
But we're only
getting started.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.600
Ah, it's been a long day,
though, hasn't it?

12:30.640 --> 12:32.440
Yeah, I might hit
the road meself.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.640
Frank, we're supposed
to be having a party.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.920
Yeah, I know.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.240
We were, until that
clown started

12:37.280 --> 12:39.240
wrecking
the fucking buzz.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.600
But I put out all the food.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.680
I'll wrap it up and you can
take it with you.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.000
See you. Thanks.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.640
Bye.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.280
Thank you.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.480
See you.Bye, Frank.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.280
Night, Frank.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.880
Mikey, you don't have to go
back into that house again

13:10.920 --> 13:12.600
if you don't want to,
you know?

13:12.640 --> 13:14.920
I have a spare room.I'll be grand.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.360
Thanks, though.
Here.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.840
See you tomorrow.Alright.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.960
Good night.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.640
It's good to have Michael back,
isn't it?

14:45.680 --> 14:48.040
Yeah.
Hmm.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.880
Hey.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.160
Hey.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.680
Leave it.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.360
I don't want to
get up to a kip.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.640
We'll do it
in the morning.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.880
[Scoffs] "We"?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.880
Yes.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.280
Yes, "we."

15:05.320 --> 15:09.280
I'll get up early with you
and we'll do it together.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.800
Now, that is a lie.[Laughs]

15:12.840 --> 15:14.600
Come on.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.320
Leave it.
[Whispering] Leave it.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.920
Ah. Just let me
finish this, Jimmy.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.480
It'll only
take a few minutes,

15:21.520 --> 15:22.640
then I'll be in, too.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.960
Alright.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.240
Five minutes.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.120
Five minutes, then I'm gonna
come looking for you.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.040
Okay.
I mean it.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
He's not
what I was expecting.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.520
Who?
Michael.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.960
He's quieter
than I thought.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.160
He's real shy
or something.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.880
He's not shy
when you cross him.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.120
Can we go home now or what?Yeah, in a sec.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.440
There's something I need
to sort out first.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.880
It won't take long.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.200
Eric, you've been
saying that for ages.

16:06.240 --> 16:10.960
Yeah, and I mean it.

16:11.000 --> 16:11.880
What are you doing?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.920
What here.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.160
Hey!
Moore!

16:17.200 --> 16:18.880
Caolan:
Who ordered a cunt?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.080
'Cause a cunt
definitely arrived.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.920
I'm a cunt, am I?
Come here and say that, Moore.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.160
Come here
and smile like that.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.000
Come on.
Fuck off, Eric.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.360
You're making a show
of yourself.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.800
I'm making a show
of meself?

16:28.840 --> 16:30.680
I'm the one standing here
outside your gaff.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.880
So, what are you gonna do
about it?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.120
Do something about it.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.080
Do something.Smash him, bro!

16:35.120 --> 16:36.480
You'll do fucking nothing,
'cause you're a little

16:36.520 --> 16:37.760
fucking bitch.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
Faggot.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.560
Oh!

16:45.400 --> 16:46.880
Nikki: Eric!

16:51.400 --> 16:53.680
Fuck off home, you hear me?
Get the fuck home!

16:53.720 --> 16:55.680
Get out of here,
you little baldy rat!

16:55.720 --> 16:57.840
Someone's gonna call the guards!Get in the car!
Get in the fucking car!

16:57.880 --> 16:59.720
Bring her fucking home,
will ya?

16:59.760 --> 17:01.360
For fuck's sake.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.400
Fucking tramp.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.640
You're a scorpy cunt, anyway.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.360
Fuck's sake, Eric.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.840
Eric.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.680
Eric, calm down.Don't tell me to calm down!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.600
You know that only winds me up
even more!

17:20.560 --> 17:22.480
Okay, then,
take a deep breath.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.880
That's even
fucking worse!

17:33.880 --> 17:35.880
Eric...
What?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.680
Shouldn't you go talk
to Frank first?

17:37.720 --> 17:40.240
No. I'm not gonna fucking talk
to him, and neither are you.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.800
This stays between us.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.640
Do you hear me?
Yeah.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.160
Yeah?

17:52.880 --> 17:55.080
Alright. Just wait here,
alright.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.880
Where are you going?Just stay here.

18:01.120 --> 18:06.720
Look, don't look so worried,
alright?

18:06.760 --> 18:08.840
I'll be back in no time.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.520
Okay?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
Man: His fucking fat ex.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.920
Announcer:
Now, turning up the...

19:35.960 --> 19:38.840
Fucking taking
your fucking time.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.880
...with Aiden and Vanisha...

19:50.560 --> 19:52.200
Seriously?

19:52.240 --> 19:55.400
What is the actual point
of this, Mam?

19:55.440 --> 20:00.120
Like, what am I supposed to do
at the dealership, anyway?

20:00.160 --> 20:03.760
There's always work,
for those who want it.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.240
[Laughs] Jesus.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.520
Have you any idea
how Amish that sounds?

20:09.560 --> 20:13.360
Next you'll have me weaving me
own clothes or something.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.760
Fucking hell.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.440
Have you filled out
your CAO form yet?

20:18.480 --> 20:19.840
Not this again.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.240
Ah, look,
it's up to you.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.360
You can either come in
to work with me,

20:24.400 --> 20:25.960
or you can stay at home,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.560
pick out your college courses,
fill out your CAO.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.360
Alright, fine.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.560
I'll fill out me CAO.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.400
Go on.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.560
Love you.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
Yeah, whatever.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.360
Alright?Alright. How'd you get on?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.880
Not a bother. That's all the V5s
and a list of buyers for them.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.680
Did you check all these
have drivers licenses?

21:23.720 --> 21:26.080
Yep.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.080
When can I start using lads
for a second time?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.920
Well, not
in the same tax year.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.960
And two of these
are from the same estate.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.440
Well, it's not easy
finding new people each go.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.200
It's a red flag
for revenue and fraud,

21:36.240 --> 21:38.400
so I can't take both
in the same batch.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.960
I need to get rid of one
and find somebody else.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.840
I mean, we can use them
in the future,

21:41.880 --> 21:43.560
but not in this next run.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.520
Yeah, okay.Alright, come on.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.080
We'll get these on the system
and then I'll get you paid.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.120
So, Eamon wants us sourcing all
our gear from him, and only him.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.120
Well, that's
a load of bollix.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.480
If we're relying on Eamon
for everything,

22:03.520 --> 22:04.960
he'll have us by the balls.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
He already has,
and he knows it.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.960
The shit with Caolan Moore,
that's just the start of it.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.240
Eamon wants to squeeze
out anyone

22:12.280 --> 22:14.720
who's not exclusive
to him.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.000
I don't see with what's wrong
with the way things are.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.560
"The model is changing."Okay?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.400
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

22:22.440 --> 22:24.240
It means that Eamon
wants everybody

22:24.280 --> 22:27.040
buying all their gear off him
at the price he says

22:27.080 --> 22:29.400
and selling it on
at the price he says,

22:29.440 --> 22:32.080
and he won't be happy
until we are running a franchise

22:32.120 --> 22:36.320
of Eamon fucking Cunningham
limited.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.520
I just bought that, Frank.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.480
It's fresh.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.880
Just checking.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.200
Jimmy:
So, what are we gonna do?

22:43.240 --> 22:50.000
Well, I told him that
I would up his cut to 35%.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.480
-[Exhales sharply]
-Wow.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.720
Jesus Christ, Frank,
we might as well

22:52.760 --> 22:53.840
be fucking working for him.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.360
Yeah, but we're not.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.000
If we want to keep any kind
of independence,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.360
we need to be making him
so much fucking money

22:58.400 --> 23:00.120
that it would cost him
to replace us.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.960
Hiya, Mikey.Birdy: Oh, yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.840
Knocked into you earlier,
but there was no answer.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.120
Yeah, I couldn't sleep,
went out for a walk.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.640
Yeah, sleeping's the hardest bit
when you get out,

23:11.680 --> 23:13.040
but it gets easier.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.480
Mikey doesn't want
to talk about the joy.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.840
We were only saying,
you've been missed.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.240
It's good to have you back.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.320
Your favorite.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.040
Yeah, I have to split.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.800
See yous later.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.520
Alright.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.120
Alright, Eric.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.520
Listen, Frank,
I'm gonna need a job.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.160
Frank:
Yeah, that's no bother.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.360
Jimmy was looking after
your end on the inside,

23:36.400 --> 23:37.960
so, yeah, it's there
waiting for you.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.280
I mean a proper job,
something legal.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.960
What for?I need one of them
to get access to Anna.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.520
Do you think
they'll let you see her?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.640
Of course they will.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.280
He's her Da.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.440
You know
it's not that simple.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.320
Well, it should be.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.720
That young one belongs here
with Mikey, and us.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.320
Look, take this for now.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.320
I'll sort out something
for you.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.520
Thanks, Frank.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.960
I appreciate that.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.600
Eamon: You sure you didn't do
anything to provoke this?

24:17.640 --> 24:20.440
Caolan: No. Nothing.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.080
Because
if you're lying to me,

24:22.120 --> 24:23.440
they'll be fishing you
out of the fucking river.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.960
I swear.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.760
Eric just showed up
out of the blue,

24:26.800 --> 24:28.760
mounting over
and making threats,

24:28.800 --> 24:32.160
so we gave him a few digs.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.760
Nothing heavy.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.000
Just a few slaps.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.360
Then he shows up at the session,
starts shooting.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.920
I want to deal
with Viking meself,

24:45.960 --> 24:47.520
if you give it the okay.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.640
Go on.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.520
I need you to book
VRT appointments

25:09.560 --> 25:11.600
for all the new cars
that Noel brought in.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.040
Uh, yeah, no problems.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.760
And...

25:27.280 --> 25:28.720
Just a sec.
Mm.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.400
How are you?Everything okay?

25:38.440 --> 25:39.840
Yeah, yeah.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.560
Just thinking about
changing the car.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.640
Something different.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.280
Oh.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.160
Is there any reason
you're changing so soon?

25:46.200 --> 25:50.000
Ah,
Nikki doesn't like it.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.680
What doesn't she like
about it?[Chuckles] What?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.200
Am I not allowed to change
the car or something?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.440
No. Of course.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.520
How about that?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
That's nice.
Yeah.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.160
That one's reserved.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.840
We do have this.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.840
You joking me?

26:14.560 --> 26:16.960
That's a fucking old
fella's car.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.920
Well, that's the only one
I have available.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.160
What about all those?

26:22.200 --> 26:25.040
They're not even
VRT registered yet.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.800
But if you want to hang
onto the car you have

26:26.840 --> 26:29.080
and then come back into me
next week, I'll sort you out.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.320
Right.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.520
Frank: Did you know
that was his plan?

27:24.560 --> 27:26.120
I knew he'd
want to see Anna,

27:26.160 --> 27:29.440
but not that he wasn't
coming back to work.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.600
You have a word with him,
Birdy, will ya?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.440
He listens to you.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.040
Yeah.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.160
Something wrong?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.720
Michael needs a job.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.000
I want you to find him something
at the dealership.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
Is he not going back
with Jimmy?

27:47.080 --> 27:49.040
Apparently not.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.480
Uh, what do you
want him doing?

27:51.520 --> 27:53.800
Put him washing cars.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.520
If that's what you want.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.000
I just said, didn't I?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.240
Let's see how long
he likes that.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.480
You can't take a corner.
[Laughs]

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
Look at that.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.600
Good day?

28:20.640 --> 28:22.240
Both: Yeah.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.000
Mam, stop.

28:24.040 --> 28:27.000
Alright, stay there,
stay there.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.600
You can't drive.
Look, look.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.320
You're straight
off the edge.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.920
Oh.
Look at this,
look at this.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.040
You're getting over.Jamie, did you do your CAO?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.640
What?Your college applications?

28:37.680 --> 28:39.640
No, not yet.Seriously?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.000
Alright, hang on.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.760
Ah, Mam, Mam, Mam,
Mam, Mam.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.760
Ah.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.960
We hadn't even saved that.Oh.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.800
I think I might just go up
to me room.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.520
I don't get it.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.520
You just don't care about
going to college.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.320
No, I just don't care
about going to college.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.880
Have you any idea
how idiotic that sounds?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.560
College isn't for everyone.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.760
Fine.
Not college.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.160
What are you gonna do, then?

29:09.360 --> 29:10.360
I can work with Dad.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.480
No. No.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.480
I've already told you
that is not happening.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.400
So, it's fine
for Dad and Uncle Frank

29:16.440 --> 29:18.520
and everyone else in the family
to be involved, but not me.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.760
They're not my child.
You are.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.240
And what about you, Mam?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.760
Is it alright for you
to be involved, too?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.520
What I do is different.No, it's not.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.520
It's all part of the same thing,
and you know it.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.760
They make the money,
and you clean it,

29:30.800 --> 29:32.280
and it pays for everything.

29:32.320 --> 29:37.000
This house, our clothes,
holidays, the lot.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.800
You send us
to private school,

29:38.840 --> 29:40.760
and you want me
to go to college.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.360
Where does all that money
come from?

29:45.000 --> 29:48.120
Exactly.
You're a hypocrite.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.320
I do it all for you
and your brother.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.480
I can hear yous two
from downstairs.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.160
Don't you want
something better for yourself?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.120
No.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.920
What is better
than all of this?

30:05.080 --> 30:09.000
Are you really
this fucking stupid?

30:09.040 --> 30:11.680
Jamie, go down
and feed the snakes.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.120
Please.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.960
Jamie, you could literally
do anything you want.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.400
What?

30:32.440 --> 30:35.200
Can't make him do something
he doesn't want to do.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.160
Watch me.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.720
He's clever, and I'm not
letting him waste that.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.760
He's not working with you.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.680
It's just not happening.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.640
Not while I draw breath.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.560
I'm not being funny, Amanda,
but that's not exactly

30:49.600 --> 30:53.440
a decision you get
to make on your own, now, is it?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.360
Jamie's my son, too.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.520
Fucking pain.That's it.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.120
Had a good week.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.400
I'll be on.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.240
[Exhales]
Yep. Yep.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.800
What?Frank: Where are you?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.720
I'm working.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.600
Come and see me now.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.840
Why?

31:58.880 --> 32:02.240
Because I said so.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.680
Yep.
[Coughs]

32:04.720 --> 32:05.800
Swing by the shop.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.040
Not a bother. Yeah.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.560
Kem: Fudge.

32:08.600 --> 32:09.640
Yeah, yeah.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.440
Alright?
Good.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.800
Good day?Yeah. Decent.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.280
Yeah?
Looks like it.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.280
I know.[Chuckles]

32:55.320 --> 32:57.120
Frank wants to
see Eric alone.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.160
Be out in a minute.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.400
You wanted to see me?

33:26.920 --> 33:29.880
You know anything about
that shooting last night?

33:29.920 --> 33:32.120
No. Why?

33:32.160 --> 33:35.160
You sure about that?

33:35.200 --> 33:37.240
I wish it was me.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.200
Those muppets
deserve everything they get.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.480
I was with Nikki all night.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.480
Ask her if you want.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.080
Okay, give us the bag.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.400
You go and get her.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.480
Tell him.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.360
Eric was with me all last night,
Frank.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.800
He didn't go anywhere.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.560
Better not be
lying to me.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.920
I'm not. I swear.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.520
Come on, love.

35:02.440 --> 35:06.280
Birdy: I'll put this in the
fridge. You can have it later.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.520
I'll get you a few more bits,
Mikey.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.840
I'll fill this up for you.

35:09.880 --> 35:10.920
No, you don't have to go
to any trouble.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.560
I can do that.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.000
It's not trouble.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.040
Not for family.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.760
I missed having you around,
Mikey.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.240
We all have.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.280
We've all bee waiting for you
to get out.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.600
Especially Frank
and your brother.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.240
It's been tough on them
without you,

35:33.280 --> 35:35.440
carrying the load
all on their own.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.800
I mean, Eric's...

35:37.840 --> 35:41.440
he's a good boy,
but he's not you.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.560
Hmm.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.120
But you're back now.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.080
That's the main thing.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.160
Yeah.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.760
You understand
what I'm saying.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.440
I know you do.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.720
You're not like
your mother.

35:57.760 --> 36:01.080
You're a Kinsella,
and we stick together.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.440
Always.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.520
Sharon: Morning, Amanda.

36:25.560 --> 36:28.600
Hiya.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.240
Oh, he said
you were expecting him.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.640
Okay.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.800
Thanks, Sharon.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.080
No worries.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.600
How are you?

36:42.640 --> 36:46.400
Frank said he's spoken to you
about giving me a job.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.400
Look, I can put you on the books
and pay you a salary

36:48.440 --> 36:50.360
so you have a job.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.800
It means you don't have to come
in here if you don't want to.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.800
No, I want to work.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.560
What else am I gonna do?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.360
Okay.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.960
Does Mam know about this?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.760
Sometimes with your Ma,
it's easier to apologize

37:12.800 --> 37:14.800
than ask permission.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.560
Just keep your mouth shut
and do as I say, alright?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.960
Yeah, no problem.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.800
Ah!

37:26.840 --> 37:28.040
Ah!

37:32.200 --> 37:33.880
Ah!

37:33.920 --> 37:37.000
Fucking prick.
Come here.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.520
Jamie,
shut the fucking door.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.480
Shut the door.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.000
Where's the fucking money,
Keith?

37:46.040 --> 37:47.680
I don't have it, Jimmy,
but I'll get it for you.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.800
I swear to God.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.760
See that iron?
Plug it in.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.480
Come here, you fuck.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.320
Get the fuck up.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.000
Aah!

38:00.840 --> 38:02.920
Gimme that.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.360
You have until this iron heats
up to pay me

38:04.400 --> 38:05.640
what you owe me, Keith.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.320
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.320
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.240
How much have you got
in here?

38:11.280 --> 38:13.960
Lie to me and I'll burn
the fucking balls off ya.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.240
There's -- There's 400 in
the pocket of that green jacket.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Jamie, go get it.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.080
I'll be back next week
for the rest. You understand?

38:24.120 --> 38:25.840
Yeah, I'll have it for you then,
Jimmy. Swear to God.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.880
Jamie, did you get it?
How much?

38:27.920 --> 38:30.720
Ah.
There's less than 300 here.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.360
[Iron sizzling]Aah!

38:49.480 --> 38:51.160
How you getting on?

38:51.200 --> 38:53.160
Yeah, grand.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.400
But, eh, tomorrow,
I might lose the tie.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.120
I was just about to go
for lunch, if you're hungry?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.920
Yeah.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.120
Here.Keep it. You earned it.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.960
Here.
Keep it.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.080
How do you know
when a junkie's lying to you?

39:27.680 --> 39:29.440
I don't know, Dad.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.040
He's talking.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.880
Don't waste your pity
on junkies, son.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.640
Come here.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.080
Love you.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.520
Put on your seatbelt.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.520
Must be nice,

40:01.560 --> 40:05.000
being out
and seeing everyone again.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.600
Yeah, it is.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.320
Have you noticed
many changes?

40:11.360 --> 40:14.320
Your boys
have gotten big.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.080
Big and bold.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.240
Jamie looks like he's a bit
of a heartbreaker.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.640
Yeah, well, he's certainly
breaking my heart at the moment.

40:22.680 --> 40:26.240
Ah. You know what teenagers
are like.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.520
Arseholes?

40:29.880 --> 40:32.960
I'm sure
he's not that bad.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.640
I mean, the stuff we did
when we were his age?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.640
Thanks.

40:46.240 --> 40:49.440
There's no metal inside.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.000
Food tastes funny
off it now.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.680
How long are you gonna
keep this up for?

40:58.720 --> 41:01.920
Keep what up?
This.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.160
Frank's not gonna leave you
washing cars for me.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.640
Him and Jimmy want
you back with them.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.840
Frank knows the story.
So does Jimmy.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.600
And what isthe story?

41:10.640 --> 41:13.760
I can't be getting into trouble,
not if I want to see Anna.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.280
They're letting you
see her?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.000
My solicitor reckons
if I can show I've got a job

41:17.040 --> 41:19.000
and I'm staying
out of trouble,

41:19.040 --> 41:20.680
there's a chance
they'll give me access.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.600
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

41:22.640 --> 41:26.480
[Chuckles]
What do you mean?

41:26.520 --> 41:30.000
She's been through so much,
Michael.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.200
Yeah.
I know.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.280
That's why I want
to make it up to her now.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.800
You need to think
about what's best for Anna.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.920
I am.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.600
And I think having her father
in her life is what's best.

41:49.280 --> 41:54.040
Maybe the kindest thing
is to just...

41:54.080 --> 41:57.080
leave her be.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.000
I fucking hear you!

42:32.760 --> 42:34.000
What?

42:34.040 --> 42:35.960
Breslin:
It's Detective Breslin.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.760
Fuck's sake, Eric.

42:43.800 --> 42:44.760
Put some clothes on,
will ya?

42:44.800 --> 42:47.120
What?

42:47.160 --> 42:50.080
Just a huge fucking cock.

42:50.120 --> 42:53.080
Some of us have one.

42:53.120 --> 42:56.760
So, whatever you've got for me,
let's be hearing it.

42:56.800 --> 43:01.760
I'm obliged to inform you that
we have credible information

43:01.800 --> 43:05.120
that there is
an active threat to your life.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.960
Here's your Garda information
message with advice

43:07.000 --> 43:08.720
on how you can remain safe.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.520
Cheers.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.600
You're not eating
with us?

43:26.640 --> 43:28.040
No, I can't.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.800
I, um, filled out
my CAO, though.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.360
See?

43:34.400 --> 43:36.120
Law?

43:36.160 --> 43:38.440
I thought that's what
you wanted me to study?

43:41.240 --> 43:42.680
What do you want?

43:42.720 --> 43:45.960
I figured law might come
in handy around here.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.640
[Laughs] You're funny.
That's funny.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.200
And clever, too.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.640
That's what you told Dad.

43:52.680 --> 43:56.520
Mm.
Sometimes, I suppose.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.200
Ah.
What?

43:59.240 --> 44:01.480
Can I not kiss my baby?

44:01.520 --> 44:03.000
My beautiful boy.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.760
Stop, Mam.

44:04.800 --> 44:08.560
Eh, I made you, Jamie.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.560
Inside me.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.320
Jesus Christ.

44:11.360 --> 44:14.000
And what a night it was.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.200
That's disgusting, Mam.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.840
Ah.
Mm, yeah.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.520
It was fucking brilliant.[Laughs]

44:21.560 --> 44:23.960
You're actually disgusting,
you know that?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.360
It's only natural.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.480
Everyone does it.

44:27.520 --> 44:30.000
Wait, are you not
eating with us?Jamie: No, I can't.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.800
I said I'd drive Uncle Michael
to the gym.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.040
Alright.Hey, you're not supposed
to be driving without

44:34.080 --> 44:35.480
a qualified driver.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.600
He's gonna have Michael
with him.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.600
Michael doesn't even have
a license.

44:39.640 --> 44:41.960
They'll be fine.
They're only going to the gym.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.360
Okay. Go on.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.840
Okay.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.240
Bye, son.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.160
See you later.Love you.

44:54.200 --> 44:55.120
Love you, too.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.800
Wait until
you see this place.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.960
It's class.
It's got everything.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.720
Weights, sauna,
a cage for the MMA lads.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.280
That's what Viking does.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.840
He's big into jiu jitsu.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.920
You used to box,
didn't you?

45:19.960 --> 45:21.840
A long time ago.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.480
Yeah.
Da still has photos of you

45:23.520 --> 45:25.440
and him at tournaments
when you were kids.

45:31.720 --> 45:33.520
What was Da like then?

45:33.560 --> 45:35.120
You know,
when he was young?

45:37.760 --> 45:40.800
He was funny.

45:40.840 --> 45:44.840
And a bit of a prick,
like all brothers.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.720
Yeah, mostly, I just remember
him always looking out for me.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.920
It's really good to have you
back, you know?

45:55.960 --> 45:57.520
Everyone's missed you.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.600
Thanks.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.720
Anthony: How do you want your
steak cooked, Uncle Frank?

46:10.760 --> 46:12.440
Just don't incinerate it.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.040
Just leave a little streak
of red in the middle.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.160
I like it burnt, Anthony.
You know that.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.520
Same as we did it
the last time.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.760
It's perfect.
-Birdy loves it burnt.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.280
-Well, I do.
-Of course you do.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.960
How'd Michael get on today?

46:25.000 --> 46:28.800
He washed a lot of cars.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.720
It's not right, Frank,
having him do that.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.200
Can't we just arrange
for Michael to see

46:34.240 --> 46:37.200
Anna without
all this pretending shit?

46:37.240 --> 46:38.280
I don't know.
I'm not a fucking lawyer.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.880
I don't know how it works.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.880
Jamie: Look,
Viking's new shit Merc.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.840
What is this?

47:08.880 --> 47:12.040
He's got a flat.
Here, watch this.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.440
Wait until you see his face
when he comes out.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.400
He will be raging.
[Laughs]

47:33.160 --> 47:34.760
I hope this is
a fucking wind up!

47:38.680 --> 47:41.600
Fuck sake.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.360
Someone's put a nail
in this.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.440
That's been done deliberate.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.080
Oh! Fuck!

47:58.120 --> 48:00.280
You're alright, Eric.
You're alright.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.880
Lay down. Where'd he --
Where'd he get you?

48:01.920 --> 48:02.720
I don't know,
I don't know!Where'd he get you?

48:02.760 --> 48:03.720
I don't know.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.440
Lie still.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.480
Fuck!

48:06.520 --> 48:08.360
Oh.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
Fuck.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.320
Aah, fuck!It's alright.

48:12.360 --> 48:16.680
Fuck.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.160
Hold that hard.Are you gonna call me
a fucking ambulance or what?

48:18.200 --> 48:20.520
Jamie, call an ambulance.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.920
Jamie, c--

48:23.560 --> 48:25.560
Jamie. Jamie, Jamie.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.840
Is he okay?

48:33.400 --> 48:34.960
Is he breathing?!

48:37.160 --> 48:38.120
No, he's not.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.440
Call the fucking ambulance,
will ya?!

48:48.560 --> 48:50.240
Jamie![Breathing heavily]

48:50.280 --> 48:51.640
Jamie!

49:00.320 --> 49:01.840
Jamie!
