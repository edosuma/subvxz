WEBVTT

00:06.280 --> 00:07.691
I'm sorry, who the hell are you?

00:07.840 --> 00:10.207
Arthur Ketch. British Men of Letters.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.241
DEAN: <i>Was that a grenade launcher?</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:14.845
<i>Quite. We're eager to collaborate,</i>

00:15.000 --> 00:17.924
but you haven't
exactly seen us at our best.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.446
DEAN: <i>She tried to kill us.</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:25.410
And all you want to do is
help these American hunters

00:25.560 --> 00:27.289
<i>to clear this country of monsters.</i>

00:27.880 --> 00:30.486
MR. KETCH:
We can offer expertise, weaponry.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.323
The toys are the fun part.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.089
So, you're gonna pop Lucifer
out of the President with that.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.480
ROWENA: <i>We know you're pregnant.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:49.484
CASTIEL: <i>This is not a baby.
This is the spawn of Lucifer.</i>

00:50.320 --> 00:52.129
I can't do it. I'm its mother.

00:52.960 --> 00:53.961
Let me paint you a picture

00:54.120 --> 00:57.488
<i>of a world where no one
has to die because of the supernatural.</i>

00:57.960 --> 00:58.961
I'm listening.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.881
So...

01:19.480 --> 01:20.686
Mmm.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.011
Tell me a story.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.369
Mandy. That short for Amanda?

01:33.880 --> 01:34.881
Duh.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.882
- Yeah. I'll go with the cheeseburger.
- Oh, yeah.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.202
- Hey, what's the Wi-Fi password here?
- Extra cheese.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.164
No, no. Just as it is, is fine.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.408
That's the password. "Extra cheese."

01:45.600 --> 01:48.001
That sounds good. I'm gonna
change mine to a cheeseburger, as well.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.208
Extra cheese. I wanna carbo-load.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.925
Cheese isn't a carbohydrate.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.006
Mmm, well.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.124
Steak and eggs. Bloody.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.722
And how about you, handsome?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.643
Sunrise Special, please.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.441
Nice.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.008
- Oh, dude. She is into you.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.480
- Dean...
- <i>No, this is good.</i>

02:19.680 --> 02:22.570
We've been looking
for teachable moments. This...

02:27.040 --> 02:29.486
- Everything all right, Mom?
- Yeah. Just a hunter. Needs some help.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.766
Another one?

02:31.680 --> 02:35.401
Can't have too many friends
in this line of work. Okay.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.931
The Internet here sucks.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.168
I downloaded all the bunker's files
to a new archive

02:39.360 --> 02:40.850
but we're not getting any signal.
So I'm just...

02:41.040 --> 02:42.565
Nobody cares.
Cass, here's the thing

02:42.760 --> 02:44.603
you need to know about waitresses, okay?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.531
They get hit on all day long,
so you got to bring your A-game.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.569
But upside, they always smell like food.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.922
- They always smell like food.
- Okay.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.206
- Upside, "They smell like food"?
- Okay.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.640
- You're right. It's great.
- Okay.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.847
Why would you want them
to smell like food?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.041
Hey!

02:57.920 --> 03:00.207
Screens down, eyes up, shut up.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.925
- Sorry, Mom.
- WALLY: <i>Sorry.</i>

03:02.160 --> 03:06.245
Okay. Here's what we know.
Our target keeps a tight schedule.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.531
He leaves every day at 8:00 p.m.
and gets back exactly at 8:45.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.767
What's he doing?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.047
Night fishing.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.642
Wait a minute. You called us
to kill a demon that likes to fish?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.041
Yes. I did.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.804
Look, guys, this is all new to me,
all right?

03:19.960 --> 03:23.123
You got a Rugaru problem, I'm your guy.
But demons?

03:23.800 --> 03:27.600
Hell. Look, I was just passing through,
and I heard about some cattle mutilations.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.206
Classic demon sign.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.286
I started to dig, a lot of virgins
go missing around here, too.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.005
Classic horny demon sign.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.811
Which is why Wally called us
asking for help.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.008
So are we all clear on the plan?

03:45.120 --> 03:46.406
Incoming.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.047
DEAN: <i>Hey, Mandy. Question for you.</i>

03:51.200 --> 03:54.010
My shy but devastatingly
handsome friend here

03:54.160 --> 03:57.642
was just wondering, when do you get off?

03:59.360 --> 04:00.850
Whenever I can.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.166
- Hey, oh!
- WALLY: <i>Zing!</i>

04:02.400 --> 04:04.687
Point one for her.
She dropped that on the table.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.530
<i>- Right in front of all of us, too.</i>
- Ooh-whoo. Wow.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.610
All right. Internet's up.
We're in business.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.330
I'm so nervous,
I don't even know if I can eat.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.324
Everything is gonna be fine.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.366
Where's Sam and Dean?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.371
No, no!

04:42.480 --> 04:44.244
Wally! You got to go!

04:51.520 --> 04:55.730
I'm gonna be famous.
"The demon that killed Sam Winchester."

04:57.400 --> 04:59.004
They're gonna tell stories about me.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.246
Oh, no, they won't.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.367
MAN: <i>Each of us has a time
when the physical body dies</i>

05:29.520 --> 05:31.409
<i>and we all face God's judgment in the end.</i>

05:31.600 --> 05:33.841
<i>There's not one of us alive,
walking on this Earthly plane</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:37.004
<i>that will not pay the consequences
for their actions.</i>

05:37.160 --> 05:40.562
<i>The Lord will hold us in the palm
of his hand and he'll weigh our souls.</i>

05:40.720 --> 05:42.529
<i>Brothers and sisters, are you worthy?</i>

05:47.280 --> 05:49.044
- Hey, Mom.
- Sam.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.321
Dean.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.131
- Wally.
- Hi.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.406
- These are my sons.
- Hi.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.523
Glad to meet you.
She's said a lot of good things.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.441
Right back at you, man.
Your mom's real proud of you boys.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.601
Mmm.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.241
Cass.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.127
Thanks for coming. I know you're busy.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.965
Well, not really.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.567
So, what? No luck with Lucifer's kid?

06:11.040 --> 06:14.761
No. Kelly Kline,
it's like she's just disappeared.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.046
Lucifer's kid.
That's a joke, right?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.449
It's not a joke?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.646
All right, ramblers, let's get rambling.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.251
Lucifer has a kid?

06:59.080 --> 07:01.128
- Hey, what's the Wi-Fi password here?
- Extra cheese.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.560
Everyone is clear on the plan?

07:02.800 --> 07:05.610
8:45, demon comes home.
Sam and I will be waiting for him.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.889
- I'll pop him with a Devil's trap bullet.
- I'll finish him off with a Demon Blade.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.845
And I will wait at the back with you
in case he comes in that way.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.367
- Cool, cool. What do I do?
- Keep a lookout. Don't die.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.205
Everything is gonna be fine.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.121
Mary?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.490
Where were you?

07:56.760 --> 08:00.162
Bathroom. I get nervous sometimes.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.411
Urination. I understand.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.451
- Wally?
- <i>Heads up, Mary. He's coming back early.</i>

09:24.440 --> 09:27.489
Do you mind explaining
why you broke into my house?

09:29.360 --> 09:32.250
I know it wasn't just to
ruin the evening catch.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.681
Hunters.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.406
Well, that didn't work.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.731
Angel.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.325
Hiya, sweetheart.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.764
Run!

10:29.680 --> 10:32.411
- Guys, we got a problem.
- Yeah, we know.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.090
No, you don't. Demons incoming.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.402
All right. Get to Mom and Cass.
We got this, go.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.928
- You ready?
- Ah... First time for everything.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.007
Been a long time since I've seen an angel.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.601
- But not long enough.
- No, no!

11:14.880 --> 11:16.370
Where do you think you're going, huh?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.366
Come on.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.521
Cass.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.804
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know. Gone.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.761
- Can you heal yourself?
- I tried. Something's wrong.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.286
How bad is it?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.327
Sam.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.809
- Hey, where are you?
<i>- A farm down the road. Looks abandoned.</i>

11:55.280 --> 11:58.489
Take the first left,
drive until you see a barn.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.609
Yeah, okay. We're on the way.
Are you okay?

12:08.120 --> 12:09.167
No.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.844
What the hell just happened?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.005
Where's Wally?

12:23.240 --> 12:24.401
Wally, uh...

12:25.480 --> 12:27.369
Oh, God.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.886
Cass?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.685
Mama, where did those
other demons come from?

12:34.280 --> 12:37.011
I don't know. The target, did you see...

12:37.240 --> 12:39.766
No. He brushed off
everything we threw at him.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.008
- Did you see his eyes?
- What?

12:43.440 --> 12:44.566
They were yellow.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.484
He had yellow eyes.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.010
Mom, what the hell did you get us into?

13:17.200 --> 13:20.727
That's him? That's the big, bad demon
you need help with?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.445
Just some old guy.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.128
Technically, I'm in my 60s.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.171
Okay then.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.890
Hell, what do I know?

13:36.200 --> 13:40.364
I've never gone after a demon before.
I don't even know why you called me.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.570
Because if Sam and Dean
think they're helping you and not me,

13:43.760 --> 13:45.808
<i>they won't ask the wrong questions.</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:47.961
Safer that way.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.407
Right.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.801
<i>You get those from your new Limey friends?
Them fancy Men of Letters?</i>

13:57.160 --> 13:58.207
I did.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.921
So, you trust them?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.285
I just mean, I heard their sales pitch.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.320
Money, gear...

14:06.760 --> 14:09.570
<i>It all sounds swell,
but if someone walks up to you</i>

14:09.760 --> 14:13.128
and offers you something that sounds
a little too good to be true,

14:13.760 --> 14:16.525
I wonder, what's the catch?

14:18.080 --> 14:19.844
Since I've been working with them,

14:20.040 --> 14:22.361
we've taken out
more than a dozen vamp nests,

14:22.600 --> 14:26.366
four werewolf packs, and a ghoul
who was eating his way through Arlington.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.284
We've saved a lot of people.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.291
All right. So you do trust them?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.120
Let's go.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.121
Yeah.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.009
Mandy, when do you get off?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.531
Whenever I can.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.723
WALLY: You gonna meet them
fancy Men of Letters?

14:44.920 --> 14:45.921
British Men of Letters?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.441
Yeah. They got gear but, you know,
they tried to kill my brother.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.849
All right. Internet's up.
We're in business.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.003
Everything is gonna be fine.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.967
CASTIEL: <i>Doesn't appear to be warded.</i>

15:07.400 --> 15:10.244
Okay, let's get to work.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.685
Sam? Where's Dean?

15:29.440 --> 15:31.568
- Uh, he's out stashing the car.
- Okay.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.000
Wait, Mom?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.844
Um, I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.081
I mean, I know
you never really wanted this.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.842
Since when is life
about getting what you want?

17:33.960 --> 17:35.041
Mary?

17:41.280 --> 17:42.805
Where were you?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.803
Bathroom. I get nervous sometimes.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.804
Well, that didn't work.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.367
<i>Mary?</i>

18:26.600 --> 18:28.807
- Mary. Hey.
- Hey.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.207
How you feeling?

18:32.680 --> 18:34.364
What the hell just happened?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.568
- Where's Wally?
- Wally, uh...

18:38.000 --> 18:39.570
Oh, God.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.201
Cass?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.806
Mama, where did those
other demons come from?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.411
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:47.680 --> 18:48.681
Hey. Wow.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.049
- You look like hammered crap.
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.721
Let's see it.

18:58.840 --> 19:03.050
All right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
No. Hey, you know what? I've had worse.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.011
<i>Oh, yeah? When?</i>

19:07.080 --> 19:11.130
Dean, something's wrong.
I can't heal myself.

19:11.720 --> 19:16.169
I think the demon's spear was poisoned,
or I don't...

19:16.920 --> 19:18.081
I think I'm dying.

19:19.480 --> 19:24.441
No. No, you just need some time, okay?
You'll heal up the old-fashioned way.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.127
Mom, what the hell did you get us into?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.124
Sam? Sammy!

19:44.000 --> 19:45.286
CROWLEY: <i>You idiots!</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:49.044
You're all going to die.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.970
You idiots!

20:02.440 --> 20:04.124
You're all going to die.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.289
Well, this day just keeps getting better.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.646
Crowley?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.651
You're him? The King of Hell?

20:11.080 --> 20:14.801
You must be Mother Winchester. Pleasure.
I've heard so much.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.450
Touch me and I'll kill you.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.961
What's up with feathers?

20:21.240 --> 20:23.481
What are you even doing here?
How'd you find us?

20:24.200 --> 20:28.125
Wait a second.
The demons, they were yours.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.642
- Obviously.
- They killed my friend.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.161
Your friend was stupid. You're all...

20:34.040 --> 20:35.565
Do you know what you've done?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.808
Does the name Ramiel mean anything to you?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.445
- No.
- Yes.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.126
What?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.009
Ramiel, Prince of Hell.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.524
Ramiel, Prince of Hell.
It's catchy. It rhymes.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.411
And he's going to kill
each and every one of you.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.451
No, the Princes are all dead.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.005
That's what we told people to stop them
looking, but in reality? Not so much.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.681
What the hell is a Prince of Hell?

21:10.240 --> 21:14.245
The oldest of the old demons.
The first generation, after Lilith.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.841
Lucifer turned them himself,

21:17.480 --> 21:20.324
before the oceans drank Atlantis.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.929
They were trained to be generals,

21:24.120 --> 21:26.885
to lead demonic armies
in the war against Heaven.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.401
Like Azazel?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.085
They even have his eyes.

21:53.240 --> 21:57.086
Who are you? And what do you want?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.524
CROWLEY: The name's Crowley.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.929
King of the Crossroads.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.803
I've been sent by Hell.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.889
And what?
Don't they teach you how to knock in Hell?

22:18.600 --> 22:21.524
For that I apologize,
but I do come bearing gifts.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.121
The first is from all demonkind.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.967
We heard that you collect weapons,
the more ancient and arcane the better,

22:32.160 --> 22:33.810
so, may I present...

22:34.960 --> 22:37.770
<i>The Lance of Michael, the archangel.</i>

22:42.760 --> 22:43.966
Impressive.

22:45.520 --> 22:51.448
This beauty, she kills the bad ones fast
and the good ones slow and painful.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.361
Ironic, seeing as it was made by an angel.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.080
There's only one angel
Michael wanted to kill,

22:57.240 --> 22:59.891
and he wanted
that son of a bitch to suffer.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.041
The magic, it's all in the rune work.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.684
The craftsmanship.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.011
Oh.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.808
The second gift is from myself.
Personally.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.401
Something I thought you might like.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.844
Where did you get this?

23:39.080 --> 23:42.562
<i>It's amazing what some people
just leave laying about.</i>

23:47.120 --> 23:49.851
Consider it your coronation present.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.041
Pardon?

23:52.360 --> 23:56.081
Brings me to your final gift.
The Throne of Hell.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.450
You want me to be King?

24:01.680 --> 24:06.129
Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead
and Lucifer back in his box,

24:06.360 --> 24:07.805
we need a ruler.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.524
You are next in line,
Ramiel, Prince of Hell.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.770
It's just a name. Doesn't mean anything.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.728
Still, the crown is yours, if you want it.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.001
I don't.

24:22.880 --> 24:23.927
You take it.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.885
I... Pardon?

24:28.640 --> 24:30.404
You seem ambitious enough.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.323
Conniving enough. Slimy enough.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.165
So take it.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.609
Go for the glory, kid.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.250
I mean, one dares to dream,
but what about the others?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.131
You're not the only Prince.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.210
Azazel was a fanatic,

24:57.360 --> 25:00.045
a true believer in Lucifer's master plan,

25:00.880 --> 25:05.602
but the rest of us? Well, the truth is,
we stopped caring a long time ago.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.726
Asmodeus has his hobbies,
Dagon has her toys.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.888
We're happy where we are.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.483
So if you want the crown,
it's yours. Otherwise...

25:18.000 --> 25:20.082
- Oh, hell, yeah...
- I'll take it.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.043
I mean, I graciously accept.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.523
Swell. But there is one thing.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.882
Nothing comes without a price.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.561
Well, this should be easy enough.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.645
Leave us alone.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.201
And make sure everyone else does the same.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.962
If anyone, anything
bothers a Prince of Hell,

25:50.520 --> 25:52.887
that's gonna be on your head, Crowley.

25:54.320 --> 25:59.167
And you don't want to know what happens
when you piss us off.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.122
I humbly accept your terms.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.880
<i>My demons were there
to keep people away from Ramiel.</i>

26:10.160 --> 26:13.403
Believe me, that's a hornet's nest
you do not want to be kicking.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.601
Too late.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.126
What happened to Cass?

26:18.560 --> 26:20.005
You tell me.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.330
He got stabbed
with some kind of silver-tipped spear.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.211
It's not a spear.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.006
It's a lance.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.371
The Lance of Michael.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.771
Michael? As in, "Michael" Michael?

26:42.920 --> 26:46.561
Nasty bit of business.
Kills everything it touches.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.449
<i>If you're a demon,
you go up in a puff of smoke.</i>

26:50.640 --> 26:55.089
But if you're an angel, you just rot away.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.805
Sorry, Castiel.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.081
No, no, there's a cure.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.768
There's always a cure and we will find it.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.610
- How?
- We trap Ramiel.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.689
And we beat his ass until he gives it up.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.166
It's not gonna work.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.164
We took down The Darkness and the Devil.

27:13.880 --> 27:19.444
It took you years to defeat Lucifer
and the power of God to stop The Darkness.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.886
Maybe if you had more time,
you could manage Ramiel,

27:24.120 --> 27:26.088
but right now? In this barn?

27:29.440 --> 27:30.566
Hey...

27:31.280 --> 27:33.123
I was quite fond of the choir boy, too...

27:33.280 --> 27:34.725
Shut up. Shut up.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.329
We don't have time, okay?
For your... For you.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.801
So, either help us
or get the hell out of here!

27:48.840 --> 27:50.080
Yeah, figures.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.883
CROWLEY: <i>What can I do
to keep you out of that barn?</i>

28:29.520 --> 28:32.842
I smell the angel. He's rotting.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.610
Those people, they're your friends?

28:38.080 --> 28:42.290
I don't have friends,
I make deals with those I can use.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.165
Every kingdom needs allies, even Hell.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.370
Allies? Is that what you call three humans

28:49.600 --> 28:53.127
with one good liver between them
and a busted-up angel?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.481
I admit, they don't sound like much,

28:57.200 --> 29:01.808
but every Armageddon, every bloody
"this is the end of all things,"

29:03.240 --> 29:09.725
a Winchester stopped it. Like it or not,
they're an asset we can't afford to lose.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.524
We had an agreement, Crowley.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.888
No one bothers us. You remember?

29:21.360 --> 29:24.170
We made one deal. Let's make another.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.760
Hmm.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.125
What do you say?

30:13.920 --> 30:17.163
We don't have time, okay?
For your... For you.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.527
So, either help us
or get the hell out of here!

30:26.280 --> 30:27.441
Yeah, figures.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.210
Cass, how bad is it?

30:40.040 --> 30:43.840
- Oh, Crowley's right. You should go.
- Cass, come on.

30:44.200 --> 30:48.285
No. You listen to me.
You... Look, thank you.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.326
Thank you.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.281
Knowing you,
it's been the best part of my life.

30:55.440 --> 31:00.128
And the things we've shared together,
they have changed me.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.604
You're my family.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.291
I love you.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.804
I love all of you.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.681
Just, please, please,

31:32.720 --> 31:36.167
don't make my last moments
be spent watching you die.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.370
Just run. Save yourselves.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.690
And I will hold Ramiel off
as long as I can.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.129
Cass, no.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.564
Yes. You need to keep fighting.

31:51.840 --> 31:55.049
We are fighting.
We're fighting for you, Cass.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.210
And like you said, you're family.
And we don't leave family behind.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.846
Mom.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.684
What's the play?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.564
We hit him with everything we got.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.406
Toasty.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.682
You stabbed one of our friends.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.728
Your friend was trespassing.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.891
Tell us how to cure him.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.441
Mmm.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.091
There is no cure.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.768
You have any idea who we are?

33:21.840 --> 33:23.285
I don't care.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.203
I don't care who you are.
I don't care why you're here.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.284
I don't care about Heaven, or Hell,
or anything.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.048
I don't even care that Lucifer's
got a bun in the oven.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.764
You know about that?

33:39.040 --> 33:42.647
My sister, Dagon, she's taken an interest.
But me?

33:42.880 --> 33:45.201
Let me guess. You don't care.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.440
All I wanted was to be left alone.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.124
But then you come,

33:52.400 --> 33:55.563
you steal from me.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.086
And that, ooh...

34:01.000 --> 34:02.809
That I cannot abide.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.248
Give me back what's mine,

34:12.239 --> 34:14.719
or I take it off your lifeless bodies.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.969
You've got 30 seconds.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.768
Honestly, we got no idea
what you're talking about.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.485
Twenty seconds.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.244
Have it your way.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.961
Cass!

35:53.120 --> 35:55.521
Hey, buddy. Hey. We're here, Cass.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.527
<i>We're right here, buddy.</i>

36:15.640 --> 36:18.928
The magic, it's all in the rune work.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.050
<i>The craftsmanship.</i>

36:21.760 --> 36:24.525
Hang in there, all right? What do we do?

36:43.200 --> 36:44.725
Magic's in the craftsmanship.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.921
Cass?

37:01.480 --> 37:02.481
CROWLEY: <i>Oh...</i>

37:03.720 --> 37:05.165
You're welcome.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.924
30, you're good?

37:29.680 --> 37:31.011
I guess so.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.602
What did he mean
about somebody stealing from him?

37:40.880 --> 37:43.121
Who knows what that crazy man
was talking about.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.285
Let's go home.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.564
Well, that's quite a story.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.640
You did well.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.047
You sent me after a damn Prince of Hell.

38:21.560 --> 38:25.281
We didn't know what he was,
we just knew he had the item.

38:25.520 --> 38:29.570
That's not good enough. I lost a friend.
I almost lost one of my boys.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.762
- And we apologize...
- Shut up.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.566
Anything like that happens again,
anything, and I will burn you down.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.000
<i>All of you.</i>

38:44.720 --> 38:46.245
Is that a threat?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.251
It's a promise.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.724
We made a mistake.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.371
I'm sorry.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.123
Can I see it?

39:40.440 --> 39:42.522
Hello, beautiful.

39:45.320 --> 39:48.130
My father used to tell me stories
about this thing.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.800
You know, there's only five things
in all creation it can't kill.

39:53.880 --> 39:54.961
Oh, yes.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.326
I know all about the Colt.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.008
CROWLEY: <i>Search that house.
Search it again.</i>

40:11.520 --> 40:13.284
Find me that gun.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.162

40:53.400 --> 40:55.687
<i>Sam and Dean have got you down.</i>

40:56.640 --> 41:01.726
<i>You know, I still can't believe that
you're working for the Dukes of Haphazard.</i>

41:04.120 --> 41:06.851
Do you really think they care about you?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.008
I mean, think about it, Crowley.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.208
<i>They kill your kind. It's in their blood.</i>

41:17.280 --> 41:18.725
<i>And you know.</i>

41:19.840 --> 41:21.126
<i>You know</i>

41:22.400 --> 41:25.802

41:26.440 --> 41:28.761
Shut your mouth, dog.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.450
That's not my name.
