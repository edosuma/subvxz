WEBVTT

00:56.770 --> 00:58.147
Derrick Reed.

00:58.313 --> 00:59.781
In my mom's helicopter.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.988
Yes way.

01:02.150 --> 01:03.948
Yeah, Hallie's skiing up
on the mountain.

01:04.944 --> 01:06.947
Right?
Like out of all places, here.

01:07.114 --> 01:09.242
No, it is Christmas.
I insist.

01:09.408 --> 01:10.625
I can absolutely do it myself.

01:10.784 --> 01:13.458
<i>- </i> I fly that route all the time.

01:13.620 --> 01:14.963
No.

01:15.122 --> 01:16.669
Hey, can someone
answer the door?

01:21.003 --> 01:22.380
Mo.

01:22.546 --> 01:25.095
I can't believe it.

01:25.257 --> 01:26.258
Jennifer.

01:26.425 --> 01:28.928
<i>- </i> What?
- The door.

01:29.928 --> 01:31.930
I gotta go-

01:32.097 --> 01:34.441
My rodent of a brother isn't old enough
to answer the door.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.069
I don't know who the kid is,
but apparently he's a big deal.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.979
Jennifer can barely
contain herself.

01:39.146 --> 01:40.272
Mo!

01:40.439 --> 01:41.861
Rudy!

01:42.024 --> 01:43.651
I'm kinda busy up here!

01:45.027 --> 01:47.450
Rudy, a little help here!

01:47.613 --> 01:49.661
Calm down.
It's okay, Mo.

01:52.451 --> 01:54.169
Mo.

01:56.830 --> 01:58.173
Hey, who is it?

01:58.332 --> 02:02.053
Mo, quit it.

02:03.045 --> 02:04.547
It's a gift.

02:04.713 --> 02:06.715
Well, say thank you.

02:06.882 --> 02:08.976
It's heavy.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.557
Maybe it's my Dragon of
the Crown expansion set.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.189
It's probably another fruitcake.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.693
Hi, Sam!

02:21.855 --> 02:23.857
Such a beautiful tree.

02:24.024 --> 02:25.697
Hey, Danny.
Merry Christmas.

02:25.859 --> 02:27.019
Yeah, I'm so glad we got that.

02:27.027 --> 02:28.067
It was the last one there.

02:28.195 --> 02:30.035
- Are you okay with it?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

02:38.372 --> 02:41.376
And you have a merry Christmas.

02:41.541 --> 02:42.838
Thanks.

02:43.001 --> 02:45.424
- Fred.
- John.

02:45.587 --> 02:47.760
I see you still haven't fixed
the town clock.

02:47.923 --> 02:50.392
Well, what can I say?
Time got away on me.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.723
Yeah, well.
You and me both.

02:52.886 --> 02:54.646
You think we're gonna have
a white Christmas?

02:54.763 --> 02:57.016
No snow.
Weird, huh?

02:58.558 --> 03:00.185
Gifts are all packed up.

03:01.186 --> 03:04.235
Some of them still aren't
wrapped yet, but...

03:05.399 --> 03:07.618
That's great.
Beth'll be thrilled.

03:07.776 --> 03:11.155
Sure is nice that she commits
to doing this every year.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.073
Well, I guess there are people
who need a lot more than we do.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.708
We're lucky here, Fred.

03:14.866 --> 03:17.619
That we are.
That we are.

03:17.786 --> 03:19.629
Hey, did that game come in
that I ordered for Rudy'?

03:19.788 --> 03:22.917
I was kinda hoping he'd have it
for a stocking stuffer.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.587
Dragon of the Crown
expansion set.

03:26.753 --> 03:28.676
Still on back order, I'm afraid.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.467
I don't have high hopes of it
being here for the holiday.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.135
If that's the worst problem
I have in my house

03:33.301 --> 03:35.349
this Christmas,
then I'm better off than most.

03:35.512 --> 03:37.640
You got that right.

03:37.806 --> 03:39.479
All right.

03:39.641 --> 03:41.814
My regards to the family.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.650
Yeah, will do.

03:43.812 --> 03:45.439
What about headwinds?
What about flight range?

03:45.605 --> 03:47.325
I know it's a lot of weight
to fly that far,

03:47.441 --> 03:49.401
but we can't let them down.
It's tough over there.

03:49.443 --> 03:50.945
A lot of families
are counting on the help.

03:51.111 --> 03:52.613
Yeah, I know, but, uh...

03:52.779 --> 03:54.122
Lawrenceville's a ways away.

03:54.281 --> 03:56.750
No, we got the room and, yes,
the forecast looks fine.

03:56.908 --> 03:58.285
So quit worrying.

04:01.037 --> 04:02.539
What's this?

04:02.706 --> 04:03.923
That's the one I was telling
you about.

04:04.082 --> 04:06.301
Someone must have dropped it off
this afternoon.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.634
- No name, no address.
- Hmm.

04:10.630 --> 04:11.847
No name, no address.

04:12.007 --> 04:13.554
Honey, maybe it was
for Lawrenceville.

04:13.717 --> 04:15.094
No, it's not marked for that,

04:15.260 --> 04:17.228
and all of those went
to Fred's store.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.934
It's from Santa.

04:19.096 --> 04:20.817
Santa brings gifts
down the chimney, stupid.

04:20.932 --> 04:22.980
- Hey.
- I think we should open it.

04:23.143 --> 04:25.316
The two of you.
Honestly.

04:29.691 --> 04:31.443
What do you think it is?

04:34.321 --> 04:36.244
I think maybe it's
a set of golf clubs.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.953
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Dad.

04:38.116 --> 04:39.789
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

04:39.951 --> 04:42.670
So, Mom...

04:42.829 --> 04:44.456
Yes?

04:44.623 --> 04:46.503
Do you think you're gonna need
any help tomorrow

04:46.666 --> 04:48.418
with the helicopter and stuff?

04:48.585 --> 04:50.633
Yeah, I think I got it covered, honey.

04:50.796 --> 04:52.173
You said Tim wasn't
going with you.

04:52.339 --> 04:55.013
Please, Mom.
Come on.

04:58.011 --> 05:00.184
Oh, for crying out loud.
Just open it.

05:07.646 --> 05:10.240
What is wrong
with that dog today?

05:10.398 --> 05:12.821
Wow.

05:12.984 --> 05:15.203
- That is cool.
- Yeah.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.384
It's so gorgeous.

05:29.543 --> 05:32.137
- Boring.
- No, no, no, no, come on.

05:32.295 --> 05:34.263
Look at the craftsmanship
in this thing.

05:35.257 --> 05:37.385
There's Main Street.

05:37.551 --> 05:39.224
There's Town Hall.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.642
The clock on the tower's
stuck on the same time

05:41.805 --> 05:42.897
as the real clock.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.401
- I'll get it.

05:55.235 --> 05:56.452
Pizza's here!

06:02.909 --> 06:04.627
It looks like, uh...

06:41.990 --> 06:43.116
Ah!

06:43.283 --> 06:44.626
Move!

06:45.869 --> 06:46.995
Everybody off the street!

06:47.162 --> 06:49.540
Move, move!
Come on, let's go!

06:49.706 --> 06:51.458
Move!
Move!

07:17.984 --> 07:20.032
You feel that?

07:20.195 --> 07:21.993
Yeah, was that a tremor?

07:26.826 --> 07:28.078
Yeah, hey, Tully.

07:29.079 --> 07:30.831
Yeah, we did.

07:30.997 --> 07:32.499
Yeah, I'll be right there.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.093
<i>- </i> Something happened downtown.
- Okay.

07:35.251 --> 07:36.719
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.218
No one come any closer.

07:43.385 --> 07:46.104
You don't want to be near this
if there's another aftershock.

07:49.349 --> 07:50.521
Tully.

07:52.018 --> 07:54.737
John, over here.

07:56.731 --> 07:57.857
Wow.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.571
Yeah.

08:00.568 --> 08:02.946
<i>- </i> Any injuries?
- I don't think so.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.115
We got lucky.

08:05.281 --> 08:06.783
All right,
let's get those fires out.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.042
Cordon this off.

08:08.201 --> 08:09.418
I got some rope in my trunk.

08:17.877 --> 08:20.551
Oh, my God.
I think that's Jacob.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.780
Rudy?

08:44.236 --> 08:45.580
What are you doing awake?

08:45.739 --> 08:47.958
I can't sleep.

08:48.116 --> 08:50.619
Sweetheart,
I have a really early morning.

08:50.785 --> 08:52.583
Your dad's gonna be busy
all day tomorrow.

08:54.372 --> 08:56.591
We all need our rest, okay?

08:56.750 --> 08:58.093
- Okay'
- OK?!/'

08:58.251 --> 08:59.844
<i>- </i> Mo, come on. Come on, boy.

09:00.003 --> 09:01.255
Come on.

09:01.421 --> 09:03.173
I love you.

09:03.339 --> 09:05.683
Love you, too.

09:28.031 --> 09:30.033
Rudy's still in bed, lazy bum.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.328
Yeah, he was up past midnight.

09:32.494 --> 09:33.711
We'll let him sleep.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.463
Mary'll be by to look after him.

09:36.623 --> 09:37.966
So much for good weather.

09:41.294 --> 09:43.046
It'll be fine.

09:44.339 --> 09:46.467
I do this a dozen times a year.

09:49.385 --> 09:50.557
Yeah, I guess you should go.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.097
The kids in Lawrenceville
would be disappointed

09:52.263 --> 09:53.355
if you didn't show up.

09:53.515 --> 09:55.313
And I'm gonna let
Jacob's brother know.

09:55.475 --> 09:56.897
What about Jacob?

09:57.060 --> 09:59.813
Wow, look at you helping.

09:59.979 --> 10:01.105
Can't a daughterjust

10:01.272 --> 10:03.149
help her mother once in a while?

10:05.902 --> 10:08.576
Mom, I'm begging you.
It's Derrick Reed.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.990
He's a client.

10:10.156 --> 10:11.499
I'll be good.
I promise.

10:11.658 --> 10:12.705
And besides,

10:12.867 --> 10:14.995
I can help with dropping off
the gifts afterwards.

10:15.995 --> 10:17.463
<i>- </i> Please?
- Who's Derrick Reed?

10:17.622 --> 10:19.044
Only the best snowboarder ever.

10:19.207 --> 10:20.584
Ah, wow.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.627
- Best ever, Beth.
<i>- </i> Mm.

10:24.629 --> 10:27.348
Where I am going is very remote.

10:27.507 --> 10:29.851
And I have
a very strict schedule.

10:30.009 --> 10:31.761
Well, without Tim, you are solo.

10:31.928 --> 10:33.521
Right?

10:38.518 --> 10:40.441
Get your coat.

10:40.603 --> 10:41.980
Thanks.

10:42.147 --> 10:43.694
- I love you.
- Uh-huh.

10:43.857 --> 10:45.029
Hey, how about
a little love over here?

10:45.191 --> 10:46.693
I'm the one who made it happen.

10:48.319 --> 10:50.037
Hey, listen.
Uh...

10:50.196 --> 10:51.493
that gift you got your brother.

10:51.656 --> 10:53.499
That was nice of you.

10:53.658 --> 10:54.705
Did Fred make that?

10:54.868 --> 10:56.415
Dad, I didn't get that gift.

10:56.578 --> 10:58.080
But if you want,
I'll take the credit.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.460
All right.

11:03.626 --> 11:05.219
<i>- </i> You be safe.
- You be safe.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.053
Mistletoe.

11:11.217 --> 11:12.560
Wait.

11:12.719 --> 11:15.222
- No mistletoe.
- Ew, gross.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.311
- I love you.
- See you soon.

11:17.473 --> 11:19.146
Get in the car.

11:34.157 --> 11:35.454
Hey, Champ.

11:35.617 --> 11:37.961
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

11:38.119 --> 11:39.416
Hey, Dad?

11:39.579 --> 11:41.297
Did the ground break last night?

11:41.456 --> 11:44.255
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.761
- Hey, Rudy. Hey, Mr. M.
- Hey, Mary.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.297
Hi, Mary.
Thanks for the last-minute help.

11:48.463 --> 11:50.465
Dad, I wanna see where
the ground broke.

11:51.466 --> 11:53.434
It's too dangerous
right now, buddy.

11:53.593 --> 11:56.221
How'd you know the ground broke,
anyway, Mr. Big Ears?

11:57.222 --> 11:59.190
I-I saw it in the snow globe.

11:59.349 --> 12:00.817
In the snow globe?

12:00.975 --> 12:03.603
<i>- </i> Really?
- Yeah.

12:04.729 --> 12:06.449
I'll have to check that out
when I get back.

12:08.775 --> 12:10.197
Bye, Mr. M.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.078
Hey, no sneaking a look
at the gifts under the tree.

12:12.237 --> 12:14.660
Bye, Dad.

12:14.822 --> 12:17.291
Let's see what kind of trouble
we can get ourselves into.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.503
Aren't they supposed
to be here by now?

12:28.670 --> 12:30.217
Yeah.
Listen, I know you're excited.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.974
When they get here, I want you
to be extremely professional.

12:33.132 --> 12:34.304
What's that supposed to mean?

12:34.467 --> 12:36.140
No ogling, no drooling.

12:36.302 --> 12:37.804
Mom, really?

12:41.474 --> 12:43.977
They're here.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.003
Ho ho ho.

13:06.165 --> 13:07.382
<i>- </i> Are you Beth?
- Yeah.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.340
- Hey, I'm Derrick Reed.
- Pleasure.

13:09.502 --> 13:11.382
<i>- </i> Hey, I'm Greg.
- Hi, hello. Good to meet you.

13:11.796 --> 13:13.969
This is, uh,
this is my assistant Jennifer.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.845
Oh, hi, Jennifer.
Happy holidays.

13:18.845 --> 13:20.563
Happy holidays, indeed.

13:20.722 --> 13:23.441
So are you guys looking
for anything in particular?

13:23.599 --> 13:25.476
Oh, you know.
Just some choice powder.

13:25.643 --> 13:27.020
- A good incline.
- Yeah, you know the mountain

13:27.186 --> 13:28.466
- better than we do.
- All right.

13:28.604 --> 13:29.901
Let's get you guys loaded up

13:30.064 --> 13:32.408
and stop wasting daylight.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.035
<i>- </i> Cool.
- Yeah. Okay.

13:34.193 --> 13:35.570
- Okay.
- Do you need help

13:35.737 --> 13:38.411
<i>- </i> with your stuff?
- Uh, yeah.

13:38.573 --> 13:39.699
That would be great...

13:39.866 --> 13:42.369
Actually, I need you to do
a final rundown on the engine.

13:43.661 --> 13:45.254
Hey, no sweat.

13:45.413 --> 13:47.541
Yeah, we can handle it.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.299
What?
I wasn't ogling.

13:52.462 --> 13:55.557
No, you were flirting,
which is way worse than ogling.

13:55.715 --> 13:57.592
What did I say?

13:57.759 --> 14:01.059
All right, dude.
Let's do this.

14:12.774 --> 14:14.151
Tully.

14:14.317 --> 14:16.490
<i>HEY</i>

14:18.112 --> 14:19.659
<i>- </i> Coffee fresh?
- Fresh, yes.

14:19.822 --> 14:22.245
Good?
That's another story.

14:22.408 --> 14:23.768
Filled in
most of the smaller ones.

14:23.910 --> 14:25.287
Roped off the larger one
for now.

14:26.913 --> 14:29.132
So, where are we at with damage?

14:29.290 --> 14:31.167
Well, the gas mains are intact.

14:31.334 --> 14:33.553
Which is surprising, considering
the flames everyone mentioned.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.384
Maybe a natural gas pocket.

14:35.546 --> 14:36.986
What about Grainer
and Lawrenceville?

14:37.048 --> 14:39.972
Yeah, nothing. They didn't
even know we had a tremor.

14:41.094 --> 14:43.142
<i>- </i> Even in Grainer?
- Yeah.

14:43.304 --> 14:45.022
As far as anyone
outside of town knows,

14:45.181 --> 14:47.525
that earthquake never
even happened.

14:48.518 --> 14:51.488
- That's impossible.
- I know. It's strange, huh?

14:55.441 --> 14:56.801
Come on.
Let's get this cleaned up.

14:56.943 --> 14:58.945
All right.

15:19.465 --> 15:21.888
Hey, did the rotor heads
check out?

15:22.051 --> 15:23.598
The what?

15:24.887 --> 15:27.481
You don't know anything
about helicopters, do you?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.142
No.

15:32.186 --> 15:33.813
She's your mom, isn't she?

15:38.651 --> 15:41.746
Hey, you want me
to sign something?

15:43.656 --> 15:45.249
Yeah?

15:46.993 --> 15:48.495
Here.

15:50.163 --> 15:51.961
Right there?

15:59.005 --> 16:00.678
It's nice, honey.

16:32.413 --> 16:34.256
<i>- </i> Come on, man. Put that away.
- What are you talking about?

16:34.415 --> 16:36.415
<i>- </i> This is what we came here for.
- All right, man.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.380
<i>- </i> Good?
- Yeah.

16:44.467 --> 16:46.265
What's up, boys and girls?

16:46.427 --> 16:48.054
We're fresh out of reindeer,

16:48.221 --> 16:50.223
but Santa's always
got his sleigh.

16:51.224 --> 16:52.521
Good?

16:52.683 --> 16:54.981
<i>- </i> That's fantastic.
- All right, dude.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.817
Let's do this.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.903
Whoo-hoo!

17:05.738 --> 17:07.285
Awesome!

17:21.587 --> 17:23.260
Mo.

17:49.615 --> 17:51.617
Stop it.

17:51.784 --> 17:53.127
Mo!

17:55.162 --> 17:56.880
- Rudy?

18:03.212 --> 18:04.714
What's going on out here?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.427
Mo made me push
one of the buttons.

18:06.591 --> 18:08.889
All right, well,
you can play with that later.

18:09.051 --> 18:10.519
- Your snack's ready.
- But I'm...

18:10.678 --> 18:13.306
Come on.
Soup's getting cold. Let's go.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.977
Come on.

18:40.958 --> 18:43.006
I don't think there's anything
Santa can bring you

18:43.169 --> 18:44.466
that will top that.

18:44.629 --> 18:46.176
This is the best Christmas ever.

18:50.009 --> 18:52.353
<i>- </i> What was that?
- Just a little wind.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.513
We're okay.

19:01.395 --> 19:03.489
Okay, that is
a hell of a storm front.

19:03.648 --> 19:05.195
We will turn right around.

19:12.031 --> 19:13.203
Mom!

19:13.366 --> 19:15.334
What the hell?

19:19.288 --> 19:21.882
J' Joy to the world J'

19:22.041 --> 19:24.669
J' The Lord is come... J'

19:24.835 --> 19:26.712
Come on, Larry.

19:26.879 --> 19:28.222
Is that really necessary?

19:28.381 --> 19:29.928
Hey, it's Christmas Eve, John.

19:30.091 --> 19:32.014
We've always had carols.
It's tradition.

19:32.176 --> 19:33.644
Now's not the time.

19:33.803 --> 19:36.397
Hey, I feel terrible about
what happened to Jacob,

19:36.555 --> 19:39.058
but you know how much
he loved this time of year.

19:40.059 --> 19:42.528
I wouldn't get between this man
and his decorations

19:42.687 --> 19:44.485
if I were you, John.

19:45.481 --> 19:46.733
I think this town
should just carry on

19:46.899 --> 19:48.071
in the Christmas spirit.

19:54.573 --> 19:55.745
Hey, Fred.

19:55.908 --> 19:59.037
- You fixed it!
- Fixed what?

20:00.413 --> 20:01.630
The clock.

20:01.789 --> 20:03.291
You got it going.

20:06.085 --> 20:07.962
Impossible.
I haven't touched it.

20:08.129 --> 20:10.257
Well, it's working now.

20:10.423 --> 20:12.721
No, you don't understand.

20:14.093 --> 20:15.561
I took the guts out years ago.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.848
They're in my shop.
It can't work.

20:22.143 --> 20:24.316
Whoa.

20:24.478 --> 20:26.526
What the hell is that?

20:29.024 --> 20:31.026
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Alaska Charter

20:31.193 --> 20:32.993
November-101. We are
in a serious storm system

20:33.028 --> 20:34.780
at the bottom of Mount Thalberg.

20:44.874 --> 20:46.251
Jenn, I need your help.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.634
<i>- </i> What?
- I need you...

20:47.793 --> 20:49.136
I need you to find me
a frequency.

20:49.295 --> 20:51.047
You need to get a message out.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.263
Honey, go through
each frequency.

20:59.847 --> 21:01.207
Mayday, Mayday.
Can anyone hear us?

21:01.348 --> 21:03.897
<i>- </i> This is Jennifer Miller.

21:04.059 --> 21:05.777
Mom!

21:05.936 --> 21:07.938
You ever seen
anything like that before?

21:08.105 --> 21:10.483
No.

21:10.649 --> 21:12.947
Mayday, this is Jennifer Miller.

21:13.986 --> 21:15.988
- Mayday, Mayday!
- Jennifer, come in!

21:16.155 --> 21:18.374
Jenny, can you hear me?

21:18.532 --> 21:20.159
Come in!

21:20.326 --> 21:22.203
Go, go, go.
I got this.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.753
Ho ho ho.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.263
That good?

21:32.421 --> 21:34.515
<i>- </i> That was great. Perfect, man.
- Good, man.

21:35.508 --> 21:38.011
Awesome.

21:39.512 --> 21:41.685
<i>- </i> Uh, Derrick?
- What?

21:41.847 --> 21:44.191
What the hell is...

21:44.350 --> 21:46.569
Greg!

21:51.607 --> 21:52.699
Ahh!

21:52.858 --> 21:54.576
Greg!

21:55.569 --> 21:58.118
You okay?
Come on, get up.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.282
Get up. You all right?
Look at me.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.951
I don't know, man.
Something hit me.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.538
What?

22:11.919 --> 22:13.262
You Okay?

22:13.420 --> 22:15.218
<i>- </i> Eh?
- I think I'm okay.

22:17.550 --> 22:18.893
Look out!

22:24.849 --> 22:25.896
Okay, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

22:26.058 --> 22:27.230
Grab your board, Greg.
Grab your board!

22:27.393 --> 22:28.895
Let's go!

22:35.276 --> 22:36.277
- Mom!
- I got it.

22:36.443 --> 22:38.116
Mom, get us out of here!
Mom!

22:38.279 --> 22:39.326
Jenn!

22:41.240 --> 22:43.117

23:10.936 --> 23:12.529
Whoa! Ahh!

23:18.986 --> 23:20.454
Everyone inside!

23:20.613 --> 23:22.081
- Into the basement!
- Everyone inside, now!

23:22.239 --> 23:23.491
Come on!

23:31.206 --> 23:33.300
Let's go! Come on, come on!

23:37.630 --> 23:38.631
Whoa.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.302
Everyone in the cells now!
Move!

23:54.146 --> 23:55.693
Norm!
Norm, what are you doing?

23:55.856 --> 23:58.655
You're gonna get yourself killed.
Get in here.

25:25.821 --> 25:28.415
Alaska Charter
November-101, come in.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.037
Beth, can you hear me?

26:21.960 --> 26:23.382
You all right?

26:27.174 --> 26:28.767
Help!

26:29.885 --> 26:31.979
Someone help!
We're stuck!

26:32.137 --> 26:34.390
Fred! Fred. Fred.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:34.556 --> 26:35.682
What are you doing?

26:35.849 --> 26:37.476
Oh!

26:37.643 --> 26:39.987
Those cables are still live.
Larry, don't move.

26:40.979 --> 26:42.322
The tires are the only thing
that are keeping the bus

26:42.481 --> 26:43.858
from being grounded.

26:46.819 --> 26:47.991
What the hell does that mean?

26:48.153 --> 26:50.593
He's saying unless you wanna
get lit up like a Christmas tree,

26:50.614 --> 26:52.992
<i>- </i> stop trying to get off.
- Is he serious?

26:53.158 --> 26:55.456
Easy, Tully.
You're scaring him.

26:55.619 --> 26:58.998
- Shut up, Norm.
- Deep breaths, Larry.

27:00.499 --> 27:01.921
Relax there, big fella.

27:02.084 --> 27:03.711
Look, I'll take care of this.
You help the others.

27:03.877 --> 27:05.220
Don't move.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.556
I know you don't
need Tully to be scared.

27:14.012 --> 27:16.561
You listen here, jackass...

27:16.723 --> 27:19.442
Oh, no.
Hey, hey.

27:19.601 --> 27:20.898
Okay, sorry, buddy.

27:21.061 --> 27:23.860
Just take it easy.
I'll get some help.

27:24.022 --> 27:26.650
- Tully!
- Yeah?

27:26.817 --> 27:29.366
You st... stay there.
Stay there.

27:33.031 --> 27:35.705
Norm's hurt real bad.

27:35.868 --> 27:37.711
Okay, just stay calm.

27:37.870 --> 27:40.043
I'll get you something for Norm.

27:44.877 --> 27:46.277
That's right.
They're coming, buddy.

27:46.378 --> 27:48.551
Just hang on.
Hang on, buddy.

27:48.714 --> 27:50.557
They're coming for us.

27:50.716 --> 27:53.515
Should I put your feet up?

27:53.677 --> 27:56.476
Let's just... just breathe.
Just breathe.

28:04.438 --> 28:07.612
Just like that, it's over.

28:10.152 --> 28:11.904
Did you talk to my dad yet?

28:14.198 --> 28:16.326
I haven't yet, but don't worry.

28:16.491 --> 28:18.084
Hey...

28:18.243 --> 28:20.587
I'm sure your mom
cancelled her flight.

28:20.746 --> 28:23.340
She's probably
on her way home right now.

28:26.001 --> 28:29.255
So, which one of these
am I supposed to be again?

28:31.256 --> 28:33.350
You're one of the
Knights of Omnia.

28:33.508 --> 28:35.761
You've been quested to take
the Dragon Crown

28:35.928 --> 28:37.646
and throw it into the volcano.

28:37.804 --> 28:39.852
Is that... is that this thing
right here?

28:40.015 --> 28:42.518
- This thing?
- Don't touch it!

28:42.684 --> 28:44.106
Every time you touch it
in the game,

28:44.269 --> 28:46.146
<i>- </i> you lose two life points.
- I do?

28:46.313 --> 28:48.190
- It's cursed.
- Oh.

28:48.357 --> 28:51.952
- Now, come on.
- Okay, so, uh...

28:52.110 --> 28:53.487
throw the crown
into the volcano.

28:53.654 --> 28:54.655
Got it.

28:54.821 --> 28:57.449
What else?

28:57.616 --> 28:59.414
Are you coming?

28:59.576 --> 29:01.374
Yeah.

29:03.330 --> 29:05.048
So, it's your turn.

29:05.207 --> 29:06.834
- Roll the dice.
- Yeah.

29:32.818 --> 29:34.365
Jenn?
Jenn?

29:35.821 --> 29:37.698
Jenn!

29:51.920 --> 29:54.218
Jennifer, can you hear me?

29:56.216 --> 29:58.344
Jennifer!

30:00.554 --> 30:03.228
Mom?
Mom!

30:06.810 --> 30:10.440
- Mom, I'm stuck!
- Hey, don't move!

30:13.984 --> 30:15.236
M°m, help!

30:15.402 --> 30:17.700
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm coming to get you.

30:17.863 --> 30:19.865
Honey, stay still.

30:27.122 --> 30:28.749
Okay, what've we got?

30:28.915 --> 30:30.713
I'm stuck.

30:33.795 --> 30:35.547
I can't get out.

30:37.382 --> 30:40.056
- Mom, I have to...
- Okay, stay calm.

30:40.218 --> 30:42.892
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?

30:46.933 --> 30:49.937
Greg?
Greg!

30:50.103 --> 30:51.901
Over here.

30:52.064 --> 30:53.691
Hang on, buddy.

30:56.234 --> 30:58.077
I'm messed up, man.

30:58.236 --> 31:00.238
I can see that.

31:00.405 --> 31:02.749
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

31:02.908 --> 31:04.501
Don't worry.

31:04.659 --> 31:05.831
Okay, I'm gonna fix you up
and get you out of here.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.114
- Lean forward for me
- Okay.

31:07.245 --> 31:09.589
Just a little bit, if you can.

31:09.748 --> 31:12.046
- You all right?
- Yeah, man. It's all right.

31:16.755 --> 31:19.133
Let me get you out of that, buddy.
Hang on.

31:25.931 --> 31:29.902
What kind of man puts this much work
into decorating a bus?

31:31.478 --> 31:34.277
It's Christmas.
It's a special time.

31:35.273 --> 31:37.275
And plus, people like it.

31:37.442 --> 31:39.319
It's just strange.
That's all I'm saying.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.993
Well...

31:42.155 --> 31:43.953
Larry!

31:44.116 --> 31:45.584
Okay, you sit tight.

31:45.742 --> 31:47.085
I'll be right back, Scrooge.

31:50.163 --> 31:51.961
Here you go.

31:52.124 --> 31:53.626
Here.
Catch.

31:55.127 --> 31:56.970
Look, can you get him
through the window?

31:57.129 --> 31:59.131
If you don't touch the bus
and the ground at the same time,

31:59.297 --> 32:00.970
I think you can jump free.

32:01.133 --> 32:03.761
Norm's not exactly
in the jumping shape.

32:03.927 --> 32:06.305
All right, all right.
Just sit tight.

32:06.471 --> 32:08.724
I'm gonna try and cut
the power lines, okay?

32:08.890 --> 32:10.312
Hey, Tully, Tully.

32:10.475 --> 32:11.977
You know
about electricity, right?

32:12.144 --> 32:14.363
I guess we're gonna find out.

32:14.521 --> 32:17.274
He's not one
for pep talks, is he?

32:17.441 --> 32:19.944
Hang on, buddy.

32:23.989 --> 32:26.333
Okay, I got some stuff here.

32:26.491 --> 32:27.834
Hang on.
You're gonna be fine.

32:27.993 --> 32:29.711
You just hang on.
They're getting us out.

32:29.870 --> 32:31.417
You just...

32:31.580 --> 32:32.877
This might hurt a little bit.

32:33.039 --> 32:34.791
Ready? Yeah.

32:34.958 --> 32:37.052
Put pressure on that.
Hang on.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.759
Mom, what are you doing?

32:42.841 --> 32:44.843
Trying to find something
to cut you out.

32:45.010 --> 32:48.264
Mom,
I'm... I'm... I'm cold.

34:13.889 --> 34:15.210
What... what's going on in there?

34:15.266 --> 34:17.190
- Fuel line's split.
- What?

34:17.351 --> 34:19.400
We're getting you out of here.
Come on, come on.

Dude, just board down,
get help, and come back for me.

34:53.054 --> 34:55.351

36:01.164 --> 36:02.837
I-I think I need to lie down.

36:02.999 --> 36:05.468
No, no, no.
You gotta keep moving, okay?

36:05.627 --> 36:07.107
We gotta keep
the core temperature up.

36:07.128 --> 36:08.380

You gonna make me carry you?

36:17.222 --> 36:18.599
Huh?

You gonna make me carry you?

Slow and steady, right?

38:10.543 --> 38:13.672
Dude, man.
I hope they're okay.

38:13.838 --> 38:15.278
I'm not sure we've got
any extra room

38:15.340 --> 38:16.557
on this board to share.

38:18.092 --> 38:19.594
You ready?

38:19.761 --> 38:21.604
Okay, let's go.

Okay.

All right.

38:36.820 --> 38:38.868
Okay, Tully.
This shouldn't be too hard.

38:42.492 --> 38:43.835
Whoa.

38:43.993 --> 38:45.791
Okay, uh...

38:45.954 --> 38:47.376
that didn't work.

38:47.539 --> 38:49.667
Uh...

38:49.833 --> 38:51.255
plan B.

38:52.961 --> 38:54.759
Did Tully get the power off?

38:54.921 --> 38:56.594
I don't know.

38:57.799 --> 38:59.722
Oh, go stick a toe
on the ground.

38:59.884 --> 39:02.057
I'm sure the shock
won't be that bad.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.972
I'm sure you'd like that, eh?

39:07.058 --> 39:08.651
Hey.
Stick with me, Norm.

39:08.810 --> 39:10.778
Norm.
Norm, stick with me, buddy.

39:10.937 --> 39:12.780
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

39:12.939 --> 39:16.193
I'm sure... I'm sure Tully
knows what he's doing.

39:19.070 --> 39:20.538
Okay, uh...

39:20.697 --> 39:23.041
Whew.
Here goes nothing.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.201
Come on!

39:30.456 --> 39:33.084
Mayday, Mayday.
Search and Rescue, come in.

39:34.586 --> 39:36.186
Can anyone hear me?
We got a chopper down

39:36.212 --> 39:37.759
on Mount Thalberg.

39:37.922 --> 39:39.595
Two males missing.

39:39.757 --> 39:41.259
If anyone's out there, come in.

39:42.886 --> 39:44.980
We're gonna be all right.

39:45.138 --> 39:47.812
Mayday, mayday!

39:50.768 --> 39:52.236
Still no one.

I don't want it any more.

40:23.468 --> 40:25.641
What?
Why not?

40:27.221 --> 40:28.518
Oh, wow.

40:28.681 --> 40:30.524
This is our town.

40:30.683 --> 40:33.186
- It makes bad things happen.
- What?

40:35.480 --> 40:38.359
Bad things that happen in there
happen out here.

40:38.524 --> 40:40.071
And let me guess.
If I touch it,

40:40.234 --> 40:42.487
I lose two life points, right?

40:42.654 --> 40:44.497
I'm serious.
Mo doesn't like it either.

40:44.656 --> 40:46.329
Mo doesn't like anything

40:46.491 --> 40:47.868
<i>- </i> that isn't food.

40:48.034 --> 40:49.474

on the back do?

40:49.494 --> 40:50.666
Don't press any.

40:50.828 --> 40:52.045
It's cursed.

40:52.205 --> 40:54.458
Rudy, I didn't.
It's okay, see?

41:01.214 --> 41:02.716
You pressed a button.

41:02.882 --> 41:04.259
Now a set of gears are turning.

41:04.425 --> 41:06.393
I-I didn't. I-I swear.

41:06.552 --> 41:08.179
- It happened on its own.

41:08.346 --> 41:10.565
The buttons on the globe,
they make bad things happen.

41:10.723 --> 41:12.896
Okay, Rudy. You're starting
to freak me out here.

41:13.893 --> 41:15.190

41:43.631 --> 41:45.053
What do you see?

41:46.718 --> 41:48.971
Oh, no. What is that?

41:52.181 --> 41:53.307
Avalanche!

so long?

42:34.766 --> 42:36.609

What's happening?

42:52.116 --> 42:53.288
All right, look.

42:53.451 --> 42:55.124
If we can smell gas in here
this strongly,

42:55.286 --> 42:56.788
it means there's gotta be
a lot of it on the ground,

42:56.954 --> 42:58.501
so we gotta...

42:58.664 --> 43:00.792
Okay, just sit right there.
Hang on.

44:35.219 --> 44:37.563

We can't move.

45:18.679 --> 45:20.272
Rudy...

45:23.768 --> 45:25.736
Rudy, I couldn't find Mo

45:25.895 --> 45:27.943
and the lines are out.
But we should probably just

45:28.105 --> 45:30.153
head over to the neighbors'
and look for him.

45:31.817 --> 45:33.535
Rudy?

Rudy?

46:06.727 --> 46:08.229
You've got to be kidding me.

46:09.230 --> 46:10.652
That was no normal storm.

46:10.815 --> 46:12.658
I was thinking the same thing.

46:12.817 --> 46:15.070
Dad?

46:17.363 --> 46:19.115
These windows aren't gonna hold.

47:01.907 --> 47:03.409
Keep g0il19-

47:08.122 --> 47:10.341
This is Tully in the Town Hall
of Normal, Alaska.

47:19.759 --> 47:22.057
Nobody.
Not John, not anybody.

47:22.219 --> 47:24.221
The radio's working fine.
It's like...

47:24.388 --> 47:25.890
nobody can even hear us.

47:26.057 --> 47:27.684
How is that possible?

47:27.850 --> 47:29.147
I have no idea.

47:29.310 --> 47:30.653
Emergency teams
should have been here hours ago.

47:30.811 --> 47:33.530
It's like... it's like the whole town
just dropped off the map.

47:33.689 --> 47:35.817
So what are you gonna do?

47:35.983 --> 47:37.405
I'm hoping I wake up

47:37.568 --> 47:39.991
I'll get more supplies.

please acknowledge. Over.

48:03.511 --> 48:05.138

48:06.430 --> 48:08.558
Mary's a smart girl.

48:08.724 --> 48:10.647
I'm sure Rudy'll be fine.

48:12.311 --> 48:13.984
Come on.

We're almost there.

You okay?

48:37.920 --> 48:39.342
Yeah.

48:39.505 --> 48:40.802
I'll live.

48:40.965 --> 48:43.013
I'm sorry about your friend.

48:43.175 --> 48:44.677
Yeah, me, too.

48:45.678 --> 48:47.521
Okay, let's keep moving, guys.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.978
Come on.
Let's go.

48:56.147 --> 48:57.615
Mayday, Mayday.

48:57.773 --> 49:00.447
This is Tully in the town
of Normal, Alaska.

49:00.609 --> 49:03.453
Is there anybody out there?
Please respond.

49:03.612 --> 49:05.034
Mayday, mayday-

49:05.197 --> 49:07.495
If you're receiving this,
please acknowledge.

49:07.658 --> 49:10.958
If anyone is out there,
please acknowledge. Over.

49:19.837 --> 49:21.214
If you're receiving this,

49:21.380 --> 49:23.883
please acknowledge.

49:25.050 --> 49:27.519
- Tully.
- John.

49:27.678 --> 49:28.975
Oh, thank God.

49:29.138 --> 49:30.560
Jennifer and Beth okay?

49:31.891 --> 49:33.438
They're both a bit banged up.

49:33.601 --> 49:36.104
We've got a casualty
on the mountain.

49:36.270 --> 49:38.864
Look, we need you in town.

49:39.023 --> 49:41.025
How quickly can you get here?

49:41.192 --> 49:43.320
We gotta check on Rudy
and then I'll be there.

49:43.486 --> 49:44.829
Okay. Hurl'Y-

49:44.987 --> 49:46.739
Okay.
Just sit tight, okay?

49:46.906 --> 49:48.283
Okay.

49:49.575 --> 49:50.952
Sit tight.

49:52.828 --> 49:54.250
Sitting tight.

49:55.581 --> 49:56.958
Rudy!

50:00.085 --> 50:01.462
Rudy!

50:04.590 --> 50:05.887
Hey' hey!
Stop!

50:06.050 --> 50:07.927
Stop the... stop!

50:08.093 --> 50:09.390
Stop!

50:13.682 --> 50:15.059
Mary, what are you
doing out here?

50:15.226 --> 50:16.466
Oh, thank God.
I have been going

50:16.519 --> 50:17.611
<i>- </i> out of my mind.
- Where's Rudy?

50:17.770 --> 50:18.896
<i>- </i> Where's Rudy?
- He's gone.

50:19.063 --> 50:20.064
What do you mean "gone"?

50:20.231 --> 50:22.450
I've searched for him everywhere
I can possibly think,

50:22.608 --> 50:23.655
<i>- </i> but I can't find him.
- Okay, okay. Calm down.

50:23.817 --> 50:24.943
Just tell us what happened.

50:25.110 --> 50:27.738
Mo ran away and I went to look
for him for, like, two seconds.

50:27.905 --> 50:29.705
And then when I came back,
Rudy was just gone.

50:29.865 --> 50:32.288
And he left me this note.

50:33.327 --> 50:34.624
"It's all my fault."
What was?

50:34.787 --> 50:36.130
<i>- </i> What was all his fault?
- I don't know.

50:36.288 --> 50:38.211
He was talking about
his snow globe.

50:38.374 --> 50:39.967
I tried to tell him
it was all nonsense,

50:40.125 --> 50:41.468
but he wouldn't listen.

50:41.627 --> 50:43.129
- He's alone out there.
- He can't have gone far. Come on.

50:43.295 --> 50:45.548
- We should split up.
- No way. We are sticking together.

50:45.714 --> 50:46.806
No, you guys
keep going that way.

50:46.966 --> 50:48.286
I'm gonna head over
to Maple Road.

50:48.300 --> 50:49.740
He's got a little hideout
over there.

50:52.638 --> 50:53.890
Makes sense.
You know it does.

50:54.056 --> 50:56.184
Yeah, I'll go with her.

50:56.350 --> 50:57.647
Okay, you're with me.
Whatever happens,

50:57.810 --> 50:59.530
- meet back at Town Hall.
- I'm coming, too.

50:59.562 --> 51:00.609
Mary, you should
go back to your family.

51:00.771 --> 51:02.114
No, I'm going.
This is my fault.

51:02.273 --> 51:03.820
I'm gonna help find him.

51:14.785 --> 51:15.911
Why is he blaming himself?

51:16.078 --> 51:17.876
What does any of this
have to do with him?

51:19.707 --> 51:21.880
He's got a very active imagination.

51:22.042 --> 51:24.636
What was Mary saying
about the snow globe?

51:24.795 --> 51:26.342
This morning, Rudy said
there was a crack in the globe.

51:26.505 --> 51:28.007
Just like there was in town.

51:31.302 --> 51:32.770
You think he imagined that?

51:32.928 --> 51:34.305
I don't know.
It sounds crazy.

51:34.471 --> 51:36.815
But he was right.
I mean, he had to know somehow.

51:38.434 --> 51:40.232
God, I hope he's okay.

51:40.394 --> 51:41.771
Rudy!

51:45.316 --> 51:46.863
Rudy!

51:49.194 --> 51:50.571
So this hideout that
your brother's got.

51:50.738 --> 51:51.910
What is it?

51:52.072 --> 51:54.825
It used to be
an old mine access.

51:54.992 --> 51:58.041
But if you ask Rudy,
it's his magic fortress.

51:59.455 --> 52:01.958
You know, from that silly
Dragon of the Crown.

52:02.124 --> 52:04.502
Oh, what are you talking about?
That game rocks.

52:05.794 --> 52:07.387
<i>- </i> Are you serious?
- Hell, yeah.

52:07.546 --> 52:10.265
Throw the crown in the volcano.
Kill the dragon.

52:11.634 --> 52:13.477
I grew up on that game.

52:15.012 --> 52:18.892
I guess my little bro isn't
as much of a dork after all.

52:20.601 --> 52:22.319
Rudy!

52:24.188 --> 52:25.781
Rudy!

52:31.320 --> 52:32.742
Derrick...

52:32.905 --> 52:34.407
are you okay?

52:35.574 --> 52:38.293
You know that Greg was
the closest thing I had to a brother?

52:41.830 --> 52:43.548
I mean, what's going on?

52:43.707 --> 52:46.301
How could any of this
be happening?

52:52.299 --> 52:55.223
You saved our entire
family today, Derrick.

52:56.720 --> 52:58.768
I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

52:58.931 --> 53:00.683
No one would have been
on that mountain if it weren't for me.

53:00.849 --> 53:02.522
No, if it hadn't been for you,

53:02.685 --> 53:04.938
we wouldn't have ever
gotten off that mountain.

53:07.606 --> 53:09.108
You saved us.

53:20.786 --> 53:22.788
Now help me find my brother.

53:27.793 --> 53:29.295
Okay.

53:43.976 --> 53:45.148
Rudy.

53:45.310 --> 53:47.312
Are you okay?

53:49.523 --> 53:52.493
<i>- </i> What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for you.

53:52.651 --> 53:55.746
Okay.
What can I do for you?

53:57.906 --> 53:59.908
Did... did you make this?

54:02.453 --> 54:03.670
No.

54:04.997 --> 54:08.547
<i>- </i> Jeez, where'd you get this?
- It came as a secret gift.

54:09.710 --> 54:11.007
My dad thought you made it.

54:11.170 --> 54:14.344
Me?
First I've seen it.

54:14.506 --> 54:16.679
It's exquisite.

54:16.842 --> 54:19.186
Everything that happens
inside here

54:19.344 --> 54:21.472
happens for real.

54:21.638 --> 54:24.016
- Is that right?
- You don't believe me?

54:24.183 --> 54:25.856
No, no.
It's just that...

54:30.856 --> 54:32.529
Well, that just...

54:48.707 --> 54:50.209
That just can't be.

54:53.003 --> 54:54.300
Rudy!

54:54.463 --> 54:56.682
- I know you're here!
- Rudy!

54:58.592 --> 54:59.844
Rudy!

55:01.720 --> 55:03.518
- Rudy?
- Rudy!

55:03.680 --> 55:05.557
Rudy!

55:07.392 --> 55:09.065
Let's get a closer look.

55:10.604 --> 55:12.356
Rudy!

55:17.069 --> 55:18.742
Rudy!

55:22.533 --> 55:23.785
Rudy!

55:27.579 --> 55:29.377
I don't think he's here, Jennifer.

55:32.292 --> 55:34.090
Tell you what,
we'll hang out for a bit.

55:34.253 --> 55:35.926
Maybe he'll show up.

55:38.757 --> 55:40.179
Okay.

55:48.225 --> 55:50.102
It's like
the Dragon of the Crown.

55:50.269 --> 55:52.943
The crown, it's cursed.

55:53.105 --> 55:56.575
So you think
this snow globe is cursed.

55:56.733 --> 55:59.202
Or maybe the globe
cursed the town.

55:59.361 --> 56:00.954
Yeah.

56:02.322 --> 56:06.077
And it's my fault
because I opened the present.

56:07.077 --> 56:08.954
Oh, Rudy.

56:09.121 --> 56:12.671
There are a lot of myths
about cursed objects.

56:12.833 --> 56:15.461
Sometimes the curse
is a punishment.

56:15.627 --> 56:17.675
Sometimes the curse is a test.

56:17.838 --> 56:19.306
But, I mean...

56:19.464 --> 56:22.183
even if this is a curse,

56:22.342 --> 56:24.595
it's not your fault.

56:26.638 --> 56:29.187
So you do believe me?

56:29.349 --> 56:31.443
Well, there's certainly
a lot of things here

56:31.602 --> 56:33.024
I can't explain.

56:33.186 --> 56:36.315
But the idea that this globe

56:36.481 --> 56:39.951
is somehow destroying
our town is just...

56:40.944 --> 56:43.538
I mean, there's no markings,

56:43.697 --> 56:45.950
there's no serial number.

56:46.116 --> 56:48.460
There's certainly no
"Made in China."

56:50.579 --> 56:51.751
I don't know about a curse,

56:51.914 --> 56:55.009
but this is certainly
the strangest thing

56:55.167 --> 56:56.840
that I have ever seen.

56:58.253 --> 57:00.472
Mayday, Mayday.
If anyone can hear this,

57:00.631 --> 57:02.474
please respond.

57:03.467 --> 57:05.970
If somebody heard you,
they'd be here by now.

57:07.930 --> 57:10.103
Larry, I'm...
I'm trying my best here.

57:10.265 --> 57:11.357
Look, Tully...

57:11.516 --> 57:13.314
whatever's going on
is gonna drag this town

57:13.477 --> 57:14.979
straight to hell
before it's done.

57:15.145 --> 57:16.665
Okay, Larry.
You're scaring the people.

57:16.730 --> 57:18.357
- Just...
- We gotta get outta here now.

57:18.523 --> 57:19.570
I understand that, Larry.

57:19.733 --> 57:21.093
But we can't really
leave right now

57:21.109 --> 57:22.269
until we get some assistance.

57:22.402 --> 57:24.370
Now everybody...
John.

57:24.529 --> 57:25.701
You've got a hell of a mess
on your hands here.

57:25.864 --> 57:28.367
- You can say that again.
- Rudy's gone. He ran away.

57:28.533 --> 57:30.035
- Has anyone seen him?
- Have you talked to Fred?

57:30.202 --> 57:31.749
Last time I saw him,
he said he was getting supplies

57:31.912 --> 57:33.539
- at his shop.
- You okay, Larry?

57:33.705 --> 57:35.582
I've had better days, John.

57:37.542 --> 57:38.982
Just calm down, everybody.
All right?

57:39.044 --> 57:41.718
We can't just sit around and wait.
No help is coming.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.882
<i>'</i> Rudy? Hey.
- Mom!

57:44.049 --> 57:46.268
We were worried about you, buddy.
You scared us.

57:47.552 --> 57:49.225
Oh, thank you, Fred.

57:50.681 --> 57:51.978
Yeah.

57:53.058 --> 57:56.403
Would you tell me
where you got this?

57:56.561 --> 57:58.359
I thought it was you.

57:58.522 --> 58:00.240
It was left at our door.
Why?

58:03.610 --> 58:05.658
Hell of a thing.

58:21.962 --> 58:23.214
Anybody answering?

58:23.380 --> 58:25.758
Phones are still dead.

58:28.927 --> 58:32.227
<i>- </i> What is that?
- Found it inside.

58:32.389 --> 58:35.233
Official Dragon
of the Crown issue.

58:35.392 --> 58:37.394
Face the dragon
without this bad boy,

58:37.561 --> 58:39.188
you can forget about it.

58:40.188 --> 58:41.906
Of course.

58:44.317 --> 58:45.534
<i>HEY</i>

58:45.694 --> 58:47.116
It's gonna be fine.

58:53.076 --> 58:54.453
Rudy?

58:57.831 --> 59:00.300
- Rudy!
- Rudy!

59:07.507 --> 59:09.430
It didn't look anything like that
the last time I saw it.

59:09.593 --> 59:10.810
Rudy's right.

59:10.969 --> 59:13.142
I can't quite believe
I'm saying this,

59:13.305 --> 59:15.023
but somehow,
what's happening in there

59:15.182 --> 59:16.684
is happening out here.

59:16.850 --> 59:18.193
It's not possible.

59:18.351 --> 59:20.319
Neither are about half the things
we've seen in town today.

59:20.479 --> 59:23.028
- You got that right.
- John.

59:23.190 --> 59:25.363
Townsfolk are getting antsy
and they're looking for answers.

59:25.525 --> 59:27.653
- Please tell me you got some.
- John...

59:27.819 --> 59:29.196
I think you should hear

59:29.362 --> 59:31.643
- what your son has to tell you.
- I'm worried about Jenn.

59:31.782 --> 59:33.329
Yeah, she should've
been here by now.

59:33.492 --> 59:35.292
You stay here with Rudy,
I'll go look for her.

59:35.327 --> 59:37.045
It'll be a nice change
from Town Hall.

59:41.333 --> 59:43.461
Tell us, Rudy.
What happened?

59:53.512 --> 59:54.809
A toy?

59:54.971 --> 59:56.723
A kid's toy
is what we're talking about?

59:56.890 --> 59:58.517
This is no ordinary toy.

59:58.683 --> 59:59.980
Just listen to what
we have to say, Larry.

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:01.565
No, you listen up, John.

01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:04.197
We got a lot of dead
friends and family.

01:00:04.356 --> 01:00:05.636
Town's coming apart
at the seams.

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:07.770
What does a damn snow globe
have to do with anything?

01:00:07.776 --> 01:00:09.198
Everything.

01:00:09.361 --> 01:00:11.489
Look, we've all known
each other for a long time.

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:13.657
You just have to trust me
when I tell you.

01:00:13.824 --> 01:00:14.825
Everything that's happened
in this town

01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:16.709
- can be traced back to this.
- It's true.

01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:19.041
- Ridiculous.
- It's true.

01:00:19.204 --> 01:00:20.797
Now, ever since this thing
was placed at our doorstep,

01:00:20.956 --> 01:00:23.300
we've had one disaster
after another.

01:00:26.336 --> 01:00:27.804
Every time one
of these buttons is pressed,

01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:29.636
another disaster hits.

01:00:30.674 --> 01:00:32.017
And who told you that?

01:00:37.889 --> 01:00:39.391
My son.

01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:44.901
Look, if pressing buttons
causes disasters,

01:00:45.063 --> 01:00:46.861
then don't push
any damn buttons.

01:00:47.023 --> 01:00:48.866
It's not that simple.

01:00:49.025 --> 01:00:51.369
Have you looked
at the town clock today?

01:00:51.528 --> 01:00:52.905
It's ticking.

01:00:53.905 --> 01:00:55.407
Yeah, well, clocks
will do that, John.

01:00:55.574 --> 01:00:56.917
Not this one.

01:00:57.075 --> 01:00:59.123
You all know.

01:00:59.286 --> 01:01:01.084
I took that thing apart
years ago.

01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:03.715
There are no gears
inside that clock.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.551
And yet there it is,
ticking away.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.190
And it's got
the exact same time on it

01:01:08.253 --> 01:01:09.926
as the clock inside this globe.

01:01:10.922 --> 01:01:12.424
That's got to mean something.

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:16.428
I think it's a countdown.

01:01:16.595 --> 01:01:18.768
Countdown?
A countdown to what?

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.103
I'm guessing
at the top of the hour,

01:01:21.266 --> 01:01:24.270
another disaster's gonna strike
whether we push a button or not.

01:01:24.436 --> 01:01:27.485
Yeah, and maybe Santa
and his reindeers

01:01:27.647 --> 01:01:30.275
will come down from the sky.
It's all hogwash.

01:01:32.319 --> 01:01:33.445
Look out. I got it.
Go on.

01:01:33.612 --> 01:01:35.285
No, Larry...

01:01:48.335 --> 01:01:50.087
Didn't even leave a mark.

01:01:50.253 --> 01:01:51.800
- Here.
- Larry, Larry! No, Larry!

01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:53.886
Come here.
I need to talk to you.

01:01:58.762 --> 01:02:00.810
Mom, you believe me, don't you?

01:02:03.642 --> 01:02:05.440
Put down that sandwich
for a second.

01:02:09.481 --> 01:02:11.154
I believe that that snow globe

01:02:11.316 --> 01:02:14.365
somehow has something to do
with everything that's happening.

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.873
And I believe that your dad

01:02:19.032 --> 01:02:21.911
will do anything to keep us safe.

01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:27.833
But I don't believe for a second

01:02:27.999 --> 01:02:30.001
that any of this is your fault.

01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:34.284
Getting everyone all excited
doesn't help anything, Larry.

01:02:34.422 --> 01:02:36.925
You said that thing just showed up
on your doorstep, right?

01:02:37.092 --> 01:02:39.052
Yeah, that's right.
Just showed up on my doorstep.

01:02:39.177 --> 01:02:40.724
No address, no shipping info.

01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:42.327
Yeah, then it's your responsibility.

01:02:42.347 --> 01:02:44.566
- You're doing this to us.
- Come on, Larry.

01:02:44.724 --> 01:02:46.522
You see what's happening
in our town.

01:02:46.685 --> 01:02:47.982
It's our problem.

01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:50.021
We're all in this together.

01:02:50.188 --> 01:02:52.862
- No, he's right.
- What?

01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:55.702
Okay, hang on here.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.533
Let's just say that I'm wrong.

01:02:57.696 --> 01:02:59.073
What are we gonna do?

01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:01.708
'Cause if you're right,
any minute now,

01:03:01.866 --> 01:03:03.834
another disaster's gonna hit us.

01:03:04.995 --> 01:03:07.669
Well, let's just hope I'm wrong.

01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:18.224
Rudy!

01:03:22.345 --> 01:03:23.813
Rudy!

01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:30.065
Did you hear that?

01:03:30.228 --> 01:03:32.572
What, is there something
back there?

01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:34.199
Rudy?

01:03:38.194 --> 01:03:40.572
Rudy!

01:03:46.453 --> 01:03:48.922
<i>- </i> You okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:56.629 --> 01:03:59.098
<i>- </i> Was that a scream?
- What?

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.017
Jennifer!

01:04:02.177 --> 01:04:04.555
Let's gqg
Go' go! gas

01:04:11.603 --> 01:04:12.775
Derrick!

01:04:12.937 --> 01:04:14.735
Derrick!

01:04:14.898 --> 01:04:16.275
No.

01:04:17.275 --> 01:04:20.245
Help!
Somebody help me!

01:04:24.407 --> 01:04:27.286
Somebody help, please!

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:31.498
Please.

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.960
That thing's from hell itself.

01:04:35.126 --> 01:04:37.345
<i>- </i> Stay calm, Larry.
- You stay calm, Fred.

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:40.053
Guys, everything
seems to be fine.

01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:42.471
Still no sign of Jenn.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.063
Okay.

01:04:47.222 --> 01:04:49.475
Look, it came to my house.

01:04:49.641 --> 01:04:51.564
My family.

01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:53.820
It's my responsibility.

01:04:53.978 --> 01:04:55.901
So what are you
gonna do with it?

01:04:56.064 --> 01:04:57.532
I don't know.

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.488
I'm open to all suggestions.

01:04:59.651 --> 01:05:01.904
Take it someplace else.
Another town, if you can.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.664
I can't do that.
That's not the answer.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.163
Throw it into the volcano.

01:05:08.326 --> 01:05:09.828
What's that, son?

01:05:10.912 --> 01:05:12.414
In the Dragon of the Crown,

01:05:13.832 --> 01:05:15.630
the crown that cursed
the village

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:17.840
needs to be tossed
into the volcano.

01:05:18.837 --> 01:05:20.259
Wait a minute.

01:05:21.673 --> 01:05:23.425
That's not crazy.

01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:24.843
Oh, come on.

01:05:25.009 --> 01:05:26.682
That game is based
on an old Greek myth

01:05:27.804 --> 01:05:30.023
about Hephaestus and Pandora.

01:05:31.015 --> 01:05:33.268
The gift is just like
Pandora's box.

01:05:33.435 --> 01:05:36.484
Opened up and all the evils
of the world

01:05:36.646 --> 01:05:38.899
are let loose to wreak havoc.

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:43.328
But there's one thing
left in the box.

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:47.040
What's that got to do
with the volcano?

01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:51.203
Hephaestus made the gift
in the bowels of a volcano.

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:55.840
The gift must be returned
there to destroy it.

01:05:55.999 --> 01:05:57.216
Oh, come on.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.877
Fred, what was the one thing
left in the box?

01:05:59.043 --> 01:06:01.341
- Hope.
- That's right.

01:06:01.504 --> 01:06:02.721
Hope.

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:06.199
Come on, Larry.
It isn't any crazier

01:06:06.259 --> 01:06:08.353
than the things
we've seen in town today.

01:06:09.512 --> 01:06:11.890
I know.
Well, show me a volcano, then.

01:06:12.056 --> 01:06:14.184
You dimwit.
We've already got one.

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.858
- Mount Thalberg.
- That's right.

01:06:18.021 --> 01:06:19.568
Thalberg's becoming
active again.

01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:21.233
She's getting ready to blow.

01:06:21.399 --> 01:06:22.901
That's not a volcano.

01:06:23.067 --> 01:06:25.067
Well, it hasn't been active
for thousands of years,

01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:27.539
- but it is a volcano.
- What?

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:30.997
Look, you all said it.
This is my responsibility.

01:06:31.159 --> 01:06:33.332
This is what I'm doing.

01:06:33.495 --> 01:06:35.873
The rest of you have to
get everyone out of town.

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:37.507
You can't stay here any more.

01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:39.963
See, that's the first thing
I've heard that makes sense.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:42.595
So what about you?

01:06:42.754 --> 01:06:44.256
I'm going back up the mountain.

01:07:09.113 --> 01:07:11.115
You coming with us or not, Fred?

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:13.455
I'm staying.

01:07:13.618 --> 01:07:15.291
This town is all I've known,

01:07:15.453 --> 01:07:16.875
and I trust John to save it.

01:07:17.038 --> 01:07:18.915
You know it's gonna take
a miracle to get out of this.

01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:21.050
<i>- </i> Wouldn't that be something?
- What?

01:07:21.209 --> 01:07:24.713
I can't think of a better
time of year for a miracle.

01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:27.177
You're crazier
than the rest of them.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:37.851
All right,
just take some of this.

01:07:40.937 --> 01:07:42.109
John.

01:07:43.856 --> 01:07:46.405
Honey, I'm gonna find Jenn.

01:07:46.568 --> 01:07:48.536
I'm gonna take care
of the globe.

01:07:48.695 --> 01:07:50.197
Then I'm gonna come find you.

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:14.012
What the...

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.977
No!

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:21.689
Help!

01:08:24.063 --> 01:08:26.691
Help!

01:08:28.484 --> 01:08:30.361
Come on.
Come on.

01:08:35.116 --> 01:08:36.493
Not again! No!

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:38.627
Come on.
Stay on it.

01:08:40.872 --> 01:08:41.872
No!

01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:49.089
No! No.

01:08:54.844 --> 01:08:56.687
John, wait.

01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:57.893
I'm coming with you.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:00.559
I said this was
my responsibility, Tully.

01:09:00.725 --> 01:09:02.068
Your resp...

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:04.694
This is our town,
our responsibility.

01:09:04.854 --> 01:09:06.777
We need you down here, Tully.
The town needs you.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.236
My family needs you.

01:09:13.696 --> 01:09:14.912
Jenny!

01:09:15.073 --> 01:09:17.246
Oh, my God.

01:09:17.408 --> 01:09:18.910
Beth, it's Jenn.

01:09:20.203 --> 01:09:22.376
- Beth!
- Oh, my God.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.881
Jenn?

01:09:24.874 --> 01:09:26.251
Jenn.

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:29.091
What happened?

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.255
What happened?
Are you okay?

01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:32.844
Sweetheart, where's Derrick?

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:34.930
I love you so much, baby.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.268
Stay here and take care
of your brother.

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:41.353
What?
Where are you going?

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:43.894
I'm gonna go put an end to this.

01:09:44.894 --> 01:09:46.111
John, wait.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.944
My snowmobile.
Side of the cabin.

01:09:50.858 --> 01:09:53.828
Do you hear that?
She's waking up.

01:09:55.988 --> 01:09:58.161
<i>- </i> Take care of my family, Tully.
- You got it.

01:09:58.324 --> 01:09:59.951
Dad.

01:10:00.952 --> 01:10:02.454
Every hero needs a talisman.

01:10:04.288 --> 01:10:06.131
My talisman.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.960
Look at me.

01:10:10.294 --> 01:10:12.092
You're my hero.

01:10:15.007 --> 01:10:16.554
Dad.

01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:21.681
I love you.

01:10:24.559 --> 01:10:26.152
Go and take care of your mother.

01:11:08.144 --> 01:11:10.363
You all right?

01:11:29.207 --> 01:11:30.959
You guys okay?

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:33.219
Yeah, we're okay.

01:11:36.005 --> 01:11:37.473
What about Fred?

01:11:37.632 --> 01:11:39.634
Fred's not coming just yet,

01:11:39.801 --> 01:11:41.599
but he's gonna let us
use his car.

01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:43.980
Isn't that nice of him?

01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:48.397
Yeah, I guess so.

01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:49.902
Cowboy's ready.

01:11:50.061 --> 01:11:51.563
We'd better get out of here.

01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:15.136
Oh, blow it out your...

01:12:31.477 --> 01:12:33.195
Stay here.

01:12:36.107 --> 01:12:38.610
- Unbelievable.
- Whoa, hey.

01:12:38.776 --> 01:12:40.403
South road!

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:44.078
<i>- </i> What do you think?
- Let's go, Beth.

01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:47.580
South road!

01:12:49.787 --> 01:12:51.130
It's all part of the curse.

01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:53.257
- There's no curse, Rudy.
- Yes, there is.

01:12:53.416 --> 01:12:54.668
And Dad's gonna break it.

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:56.632
Enough.

01:12:56.794 --> 01:12:59.013
We are not trapped.
We are not giving up.

01:12:59.171 --> 01:13:01.640
We're gonna make it
and Dad is, too, okay?

01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:16.773
Hurry up!

01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:18.441
Hurry!

01:13:18.608 --> 01:13:21.157
Come on, hurry up!

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:24.200
Come on.

01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:25.990
Go. go!

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.128
- We're trapped.
- Not yet we're not.

01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:48.558
Oomph!

01:13:52.683 --> 01:13:53.980
<i>- </i> Where are you going?
- To try and find a way

01:13:54.143 --> 01:13:55.520
out of here.

01:14:00.191 --> 01:14:01.659
Whoa.

01:14:02.944 --> 01:14:05.072
Now we're trapped.

01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:09.723
Okay.
Let's go.

01:15:14.265 --> 01:15:15.812
Come on, 9°!

01:15:18.394 --> 01:15:20.613
Come on, come on, come on!

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:22.822
Keep going, come on!

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:27.327
Yeah!

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:28.908
Come on, baby!

01:15:31.407 --> 01:15:33.284
Come on!
You can do it, yeah!

01:15:33.451 --> 01:15:35.954
Yeah, whoo!

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.623
You did it,
you old bag of bones!

01:15:42.334 --> 01:15:43.961
Oh...

01:15:44.128 --> 01:15:45.175
Whoa.

01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:48.803
Come on.
Come on!

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:51.806
Oh...

01:15:57.808 --> 01:15:59.435
Come on, 9°!

01:16:03.981 --> 01:16:05.483
Come on! Go!

01:17:02.373 --> 01:17:04.421
<i>- </i> Why is this happening to us?

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:06.961
Why did we end up
with the stupid snow globe?

01:17:07.128 --> 01:17:10.382
Maybe it ended up
where it needs to be.

01:17:10.548 --> 01:17:12.391
What do you mean, little man?

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.928
Every story needs a hero.

01:17:30.568 --> 01:17:32.741
Need a hook.

01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:41.370
That'll work.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.377
Way to go, Rudy.

01:18:18.115 --> 01:18:20.288
Come on.

01:18:42.806 --> 01:18:45.480
I guess I'm gonna have
to do this the hard way.

01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.648
Oh.

01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:51.986
Hang on to your hats.

01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:55.153
This is really gonna
be something.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.762
Whoa.

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.762
Okay.

01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:58.860
Merry Christmas,
you son of a bitch.

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.795
Something's happening.

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:22.132
More like something
isn't happening.

01:21:22.299 --> 01:21:25.678
Oh, wow.

01:21:25.844 --> 01:21:27.312
Way to go, John.

01:21:27.471 --> 01:21:29.314
Well, I'll be damned.

01:21:29.473 --> 01:21:32.727
An honest-to-goodness
Christmas miracle.

01:21:34.353 --> 01:21:35.900
Come here.

01:22:02.423 --> 01:22:04.676
They're inside.

01:22:04.842 --> 01:22:07.846
Jennifer's trying
to get Rudy to nap.

01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:10.184
But somehow
I don't see that happening.

01:22:13.434 --> 01:22:15.812
Some incredible kids
you got there.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.022
Yeah.

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:21.237
They really are.

01:22:23.986 --> 01:22:25.488
Still no sign of him?

01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:29.287
No.

01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:39.214
Dad'll be back.

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:42.220
- I know it.
- Of course.

01:22:44.256 --> 01:22:45.473
Mo!

01:22:45.632 --> 01:22:47.726
Mom! Mo!

01:22:50.888 --> 01:22:53.311
I was worried about you, boy.

01:22:53.474 --> 01:22:54.817
You're okay.

01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:56.443
Oh, look who's here.

01:22:56.602 --> 01:22:58.570
Look who's here.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:07.913
Beth.

01:23:08.071 --> 01:23:09.823
- Beth.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:12.539
- Jenn?
- Dad!

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.583
Oh!

01:23:15.746 --> 01:23:17.464
Dad!

01:23:21.043 --> 01:23:22.761
<i>- </i> You okay?
- Yeah.

01:23:26.632 --> 01:23:29.101
You did it.
Just like in the stories.

01:23:32.221 --> 01:23:33.939
Nice work, John.

01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:36.270
Fred.

01:23:36.433 --> 01:23:37.776
Hell of a Christmas, hey, John?

01:23:37.935 --> 01:23:40.279
Just another Christmas
in Normal.

01:23:40.437 --> 01:23:42.360
Come on inside.

01:23:42.523 --> 01:23:43.945
I got some eggnog-

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:46.201
That sounds about right.

01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:49.947
Mo's already ready.
