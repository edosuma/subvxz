00:18.849 --> 00:22.070
God have mercy.

00:38.625 --> 00:39.435
Chris.

00:40.564 --> 00:42.475
Five more minutes, dad.

00:44.247 --> 00:46.626
And they call us
the thin blue line.

01:20.169 --> 01:22.835
<i>Sam? Darling?</i>

01:25.239 --> 01:26.140
Mum.

01:26.274 --> 01:28.135
<i>I've let you down.</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:31.031
<i>I know you can't hear me, but...</i>

01:31.184 --> 01:33.198
<i>it doesn't make this any easier.</i>

01:33.294 --> 01:34.176
I can hear you, Mum.

01:34.253 --> 01:36.267
<i>They showed me
this scan of your brain.</i>

01:36.381 --> 01:39.723
<i>They look for these...
patches of colour,</i>

01:39.828 --> 01:41.435
<i>and there's nothing, Sam.</i>

01:41.540 --> 01:43.479
For God's sake,
Mum, get better doctors.

01:43.566 --> 01:46.798
<i>Negligible brain activity.
That's what they call it.</i>

01:46.833 --> 01:48.964
Get better doctors,
get better scanners!

01:49.051 --> 01:52.422
<i>You're breathing,
but it's an illusion of life.</i>

01:52.736 --> 01:55.828
<i>I know you've already gone
somewhere else now.</i>

01:56.055 --> 01:58.296
Oh god. Don't say it.

01:58.355 --> 02:01.510
<i>I've given my consent
to turn off your... to turn it off.</i>

02:01.604 --> 02:03.411
Mum, no! No!

02:03.551 --> 02:05.357
<i>It'll be this afternoon.</i>

02:05.967 --> 02:07.140
<i>Two o'clock.</i>

02:08.066 --> 02:09.603
<i>Sleep tight, darling.</i>

02:09.708 --> 02:12.512
<i>I'll put this back on
for you anyway, shall I?</i>

02:19.103 --> 02:20.463
I'm alive!

02:25.705 --> 02:28.631
Hello boss.
I feel as rough as a dog's arse.

02:28.755 --> 02:30.057
You bastards!

02:30.151 --> 02:33.283
Hey, no, I wanted to invite you,
but Ray said you'd just spoil it.

02:34.292 --> 02:35.617
You wanna see patches of colour?

02:35.676 --> 02:37.453
Boss, we just had
a call downstairs.

02:37.476 --> 02:39.435
You lot never stop
playing the merry fools?

02:39.470 --> 02:41.659
- We've got a crisis brewing.
- Get out, Phyllis.

02:41.706 --> 02:44.357
Some loony's taken hostages
at the Manchester Gazette.

02:44.444 --> 02:46.849
Reports are that he's armed
and very dangerous.

02:46.884 --> 02:50.262
He's saying that at two o'clock
today, someone is going to die.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.121
- Two o'clock?
- He's serious.

02:54.156 --> 02:55.763
Someone dies at two.

02:55.869 --> 02:57.558
So are you going
to throw chairs around

02:57.593 --> 03:00.631
or do you fancy doing
something about it?

03:02.755 --> 03:05.664
Chris, get on the phone.
Raise the department.

03:06.544 --> 03:08.151
Nobody dies today.

03:08.761 --> 03:10.474
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

03:10.650 --> 03:13.670
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

03:13.747 --> 03:17.184
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

03:17.324 --> 03:20.679
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

03:20.855 --> 03:24.269
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

04:28.503 --> 04:29.911
We need this area evacuated.

04:29.939 --> 04:32.726
If he is armed, he can
hit people from that building.

04:42.924 --> 04:45.082
He's inside the Gazette offices.

04:45.129 --> 04:47.016
Help me move this lot further back.

04:47.109 --> 04:50.028
And we need to follow standard
procedure on this one, okay?

04:50.394 --> 04:53.021
That old Hyde training kicking in?
Who is he?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.363
We don't know anything about him,

04:54.400 --> 04:55.921
or what he wants,
all we know is...

04:55.968 --> 04:58.849
that he's given us a deadline.
Two o'clock.

04:59.636 --> 05:01.100
Gives us five hours.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.812
Chris, give these idiots a prod.

05:03.907 --> 05:06.422
Can I be excused from running
about too much this morning?

05:06.469 --> 05:08.655
- I feel a bit sick.
- You got a note?

05:10.129 --> 05:11.649
Get this lot shifted.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.531
Come on.

05:14.276 --> 05:15.252
Hair of the dog.

05:15.871 --> 05:17.635
Where's armed response?

05:18.105 --> 05:19.268
You're looking at it.

05:25.272 --> 05:28.052
We need an inner cordon
as well as this one.

05:28.164 --> 05:30.288
Think of it as two circles,
one inside the other.

05:30.317 --> 05:34.187
The area in the centre is
out of limits to everybody but us.

05:34.257 --> 05:36.325
- Fair 'nough.
- Call it the doughnut.

05:36.424 --> 05:37.723
Jam or custard?

05:37.807 --> 05:39.107
Now you're just being silly.

05:39.135 --> 05:40.895
I'm not the one
calling it a doughnut.

05:41.286 --> 05:44.444
He's got a natural camouflage.
He can see out, we can't see him.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.534
Excuse me!

05:45.632 --> 05:47.659
Sir, can you go back
behind the cordon please?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.615
Stephen Barton,
reporter from the Gazette.

05:49.657 --> 05:50.677
Oh terrific.

05:50.761 --> 05:52.675
Oi! We got another one for you!

05:52.745 --> 05:53.458
Guv...

05:53.612 --> 05:55.498
He walked in about
forty minutes ago.

05:55.568 --> 05:57.650
He was just ahead of me.
He pulled a gun.

05:57.706 --> 05:58.908
He means business.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.346
You know, I'd listen to the snot in
my hanky before I listened to you.

06:02.527 --> 06:05.741
Okay, brief me. Hostages' names?

06:06.133 --> 06:09.752
Our editor, George Bates,
one of our reporters, Jackie.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.834
Jackie Queen?

06:12.547 --> 06:15.580
Think Doris is in there too.
She's George's secretary.

06:15.915 --> 06:17.983
Did you recognise
the hostage-taker?

06:18.486 --> 06:21.253
His face rang a bell but
I wouldn't want to guess at it.

06:21.328 --> 06:23.721
Sticklers for the facts
on the Gazette.

06:23.877 --> 06:27.353
You sure you boys aren't blowing
this up out of all proportion...

06:27.580 --> 06:29.449
cos it's a slow news day?

06:29.502 --> 06:32.978
- I know you journos.
- And they know you, Mr Hunt.

06:36.192 --> 06:37.205
Did you see him?

06:37.275 --> 06:38.812
Where was he, at the window?

06:39.057 --> 06:42.830
This is the police!
You're surrounded, show yourself!

06:43.668 --> 06:45.502
Can you hear us?

06:46.008 --> 06:48.785
Why don't you talk to us?
We're listening!

06:51.842 --> 06:53.502
Well, he's a rubbish shot.

06:53.606 --> 06:55.982
- Missed all of us.
- He wasn't trying to hit us.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.763
It's a message.
It means he's serious.

07:04.183 --> 07:06.541
We need to start a dialogue
with the hostage-taker.

07:06.628 --> 07:09.056
We don't need a dialogue,
we need the hostage-taker...

07:09.109 --> 07:10.768
in cuffs or dead on the floor.

07:10.855 --> 07:13.318
Look, I know how to play this.

07:13.441 --> 07:16.044
Soon as we get a clear shot of him,
job done.

07:16.114 --> 07:18.122
We can end this peacefully.

07:18.367 --> 07:21.074
I've got a plan. We work with him,
we gain his trust.

07:21.126 --> 07:22.611
Why's he gonna trust us?

07:22.663 --> 07:25.056
Because he needs us
to implement his demands.

07:25.196 --> 07:27.118
Quid pro quo.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.825
He gives a little,
we give him something in return.

07:29.947 --> 07:31.240
Gift - reward.

07:31.362 --> 07:35.414
And his idea of a gift might be
the release of a hostage.

07:42.358 --> 07:43.423
Come on.

07:45.554 --> 07:47.214
I'm stepping out!

07:52.017 --> 07:53.344
Stay there.

07:53.746 --> 07:56.349
I'm ready to listen
if you wanna talk.

08:01.396 --> 08:04.121
Look, I'm not here
to tell you what to do.

08:04.645 --> 08:06.305
You're in charge,

08:06.899 --> 08:08.383
that's obvious.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.789
My role is to
facilitate your needs.

08:26.652 --> 08:27.980
Okay, talk to me.

08:31.913 --> 08:34.131
We're both reasonable,
we can both be reasonable.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.337
What do you want?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.506
What is it that you want?

08:40.734 --> 08:43.179
I've already got what I want!

08:48.568 --> 08:50.122
Why don't you...

08:50.611 --> 08:54.157
tell me your name?
What's your name?

08:56.637 --> 08:59.554
I'm... I'm DI Tyler. Sam.

09:15.902 --> 09:17.143
Master key.

09:17.243 --> 09:19.289
It'll open most doors
in the building.

09:19.569 --> 09:22.408
He asked for it,
but I'd rather give it to you.

09:23.582 --> 09:25.315
This is the crisis centre.

09:25.371 --> 09:29.027
I think, if it's the centre
of the crisis you're looking for,

09:29.127 --> 09:30.335
it's out there.

09:30.435 --> 09:32.716
Fire brigade,
ambulance service, police,

09:32.761 --> 09:35.052
all convene here,
away from the building.

09:35.119 --> 09:36.662
Mr Barton, phone lines.

09:37.366 --> 09:39.937
They run out of the west side
of the building.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.229
Okay, we cut them.
We cut him off.

09:42.302 --> 09:45.306
I want to keep him contained.
He'll be isolated.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.267
His only way of speaking to the
outside world will be through...

09:48.302 --> 09:49.944
...us.
- Me.

09:51.219 --> 09:52.984
I'm the negotiator.

09:53.088 --> 09:54.485
I'll make you a hat.

09:54.538 --> 09:57.333
He wants something,
we have to find out what that is.

09:57.420 --> 10:00.127
In order to do that,
we have to find out who he is.

10:00.197 --> 10:02.677
I am agog with excitement.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.581
How about you, Sergeant?

10:04.668 --> 10:06.590
Think we'd better get outside, guv.

10:06.677 --> 10:09.018
Check that doughnut
hasn't gone soggy.

10:16.111 --> 10:17.421
Inspector?

10:17.771 --> 10:19.220
Tell the Inspector.

10:19.727 --> 10:21.840
I saw him, clear as day.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.264
He walked past me,
into the building, very determined.

10:25.386 --> 10:27.238
I saw the gun in his hand, I ran.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.107
Can you describe him?

10:29.282 --> 10:31.116
Ordinary, really.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.522
Lean.. curly hair. Overalls.

10:34.609 --> 10:37.002
- What kind?
- Brown.

10:37.439 --> 10:39.011
He was just very...

10:39.518 --> 10:41.597
ordinary, that's all I can...

10:42.068 --> 10:44.827
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Thanks.

10:45.684 --> 10:49.230
He has to be stopped, he practically
ran over a kiddie in that van.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.082
Found you.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.484
Reg Cole.

11:46.675 --> 11:48.544
And we've got an address.

11:49.068 --> 11:50.710
He's not home.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.765
Fast and thorough. Clock's ticking.

12:23.212 --> 12:25.291
You're the psychology graduate.

12:26.425 --> 12:28.085
Dunno.

12:28.294 --> 12:29.971
He lives alone.

12:30.338 --> 12:32.574
He's got a thing about battles.

12:32.731 --> 12:34.547
Glory.

12:35.823 --> 12:39.736
He's a reader.
Browing, Shakespeare, Tennyson.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.325
Giles.

12:41.483 --> 12:42.583
Brecht.

12:42.967 --> 12:46.042
"Unhappy the land
that has no heroes"

12:47.789 --> 12:49.466
Is he a war hero?

12:49.544 --> 12:53.579
Why would a man with a fixation for
heroism do something this terrible?

12:59.011 --> 13:01.946
I've got to find him, Annie.
Or someone...

13:02.015 --> 13:03.902
What? What, Sam?

13:07.557 --> 13:08.832
I need to...

13:10.369 --> 13:12.989
DCI Hunt, CID, uniform,

13:13.042 --> 13:14.579
no one seems to
know what's going on,

13:14.667 --> 13:17.523
and everyone's running around like
David Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

13:17.592 --> 13:18.710
<i>Butch</i> Cassidy.

13:18.780 --> 13:20.998
<i>Any</i> Cassidy, I don't care.

13:21.121 --> 13:23.042
You need to get back.

13:39.260 --> 13:42.300
As soon as he opens the window,
we'll have him.

13:43.784 --> 13:45.618
Why would he open a window?

13:45.723 --> 13:47.715
Might be getting stuffy.

13:48.711 --> 13:51.505
That bloke's marking time
is for two o'clock.

13:51.802 --> 13:53.444
So what did you find out?

13:54.422 --> 13:56.536
He lives alone, er...

13:56.658 --> 13:59.156
Looks like he fought in the war,
he was honoured for it,

13:59.208 --> 14:03.785
he's got a thing about glory,
heroism...

14:05.802 --> 14:07.688
Let me try again, guv.

14:07.950 --> 14:11.548
If he wants to talk, I've got something
to work with now, haven't I?

14:16.535 --> 14:17.810
Reg!

14:18.613 --> 14:20.343
Can you hear me?

14:20.552 --> 14:22.630
It's DI Tyler!

14:22.892 --> 14:24.150
Sam!

14:26.561 --> 14:29.023
Is it okay to call you Reg?

14:29.775 --> 14:31.836
Or is it Reginald?

14:32.412 --> 14:34.875
Perhaps you'd prefer Mr Cole?

14:35.120 --> 14:37.548
Reg, we're gonna move
into the building,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.295
just into reception.

14:39.522 --> 14:42.090
Okay, so just stay calm.

14:58.862 --> 15:00.818
Why's it so hot in here?

15:00.975 --> 15:02.862
We cranked the heating up.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.242
You did what?

15:04.312 --> 15:06.478
Boiler's pumped in from an outhouse.

15:06.565 --> 15:08.556
I wanted to force him
to open a window.

15:08.626 --> 15:12.067
- For God's sake! I told you...
- Turn the heating down.

15:13.971 --> 15:15.281
Reg?

15:16.137 --> 15:18.530
What was that,
I can't quite hear you.

15:18.775 --> 15:21.412
Are you trying to antagonise me?

15:30.434 --> 15:32.373
Hello, DCI Hunt.

15:34.050 --> 15:38.487
Was it your brilliant idea to turn
this place into a Shanghai sauna?

15:40.713 --> 15:42.268
She sounds bad.

15:42.565 --> 15:45.797
It's Doris,
George's secretary, she's...

15:45.867 --> 15:49.587
She could die. Anyone could die.

15:49.797 --> 15:51.806
Turn the heating down.

15:52.382 --> 15:53.465
Reg.

15:54.827 --> 15:58.391
I'm trying to work with you here.
I'm trying to help.

15:58.976 --> 16:01.561
I would appreciate it
if you could help me.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.460
Why don't you let me
send a doctor in, for Doris?

16:04.495 --> 16:06.399
No. No doctors.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.193
Okay, why don't you
send her out then?

16:09.263 --> 16:12.984
It would be the
chivalrous thing to do.

16:14.482 --> 16:17.033
Well, at least we know
where he lives.

16:17.225 --> 16:19.757
I could send him a Christmas card.

16:36.803 --> 16:39.039
There's gotta be another way in.

16:39.283 --> 16:42.061
You can't start sneaking coppers
into that building.

16:42.165 --> 16:43.947
I can do what I like,
I'm senior officer.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.601
Send men in there heavy handed
and you are lighting a match...

16:46.672 --> 16:48.454
in a dynamite factory.

16:48.662 --> 16:52.108
Doris is driving him mad,
and he refuses to see a doctor, so-

16:52.196 --> 16:54.484
Alright, we forget going in there.

16:54.536 --> 16:57.663
We'll draw him out.
And then we'll kill the bastard.

16:57.837 --> 17:01.104
We ensure standard procedure
for a hostage scenario

17:01.139 --> 17:03.305
to ensure the release
of the hostage-taker-

17:03.384 --> 17:04.973
What about a nurse?

17:05.567 --> 17:07.383
I trained in the Women's Department.

17:07.453 --> 17:10.230
I could administer
basic First Aid in there.

17:11.854 --> 17:13.653
No. Too dangerous.

17:13.723 --> 17:16.064
"Dangerous" is part of the job,
isn't it?

17:16.151 --> 17:19.470
Hang on,
a copper inside'd be perfect.

17:19.854 --> 17:22.928
They could give us a signal
if he goes for a slash or something.

17:23.094 --> 17:24.719
Shouldn't be a plonk though.

17:24.806 --> 17:28.055
A nurse is non-threatening.
Keep him off guard.

17:32.668 --> 17:35.113
You'd need a uniform.

17:35.201 --> 17:37.279
A nurse came with the ambulance.

17:44.746 --> 17:46.703
Tea wagon's arrived, boss.

17:47.157 --> 17:50.423
Wouldn't want you drying up in the
middle of negociations, would we?

17:52.432 --> 17:54.965
Blimey, I've dreamt about this.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.424
Don't worry love,
just like riding a bike.

17:58.528 --> 17:59.943
Guv, he's gonna frisk her.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.908
You know, something tells me
Reg isn't around lots birds.

18:02.961 --> 18:04.690
We stuff this
down her knickers,

18:04.725 --> 18:06.787
he won't have the nerve to look.
- I'll do it.

18:08.377 --> 18:10.333
We shouldn't underestimate this man.

18:10.386 --> 18:12.674
A stalemate can turn
into a massacre like that.

18:12.744 --> 18:14.071
You're not in charge, Tyler.

18:14.141 --> 18:17.495
No, the bloke with the people
at gunpoint is in charge.

18:26.925 --> 18:28.214
Reg?

18:28.695 --> 18:30.289
It's alright.

18:30.486 --> 18:33.368
I need you to go in there
and calm things down.

18:34.569 --> 18:39.285
If we get his full attention,
I've got a chance to sort this out.

18:40.569 --> 18:42.194
Eyes and ears open.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.237
Lovely mouth closed. You'll be fine.

18:44.307 --> 18:45.879
Nurse Cartwright.

18:51.385 --> 18:52.590
Reg?

18:54.023 --> 18:56.573
Brought a nurse, for Doris.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.970
Reg, she can only help
the situation, what do you say?

19:15.272 --> 19:16.651
Send her up!

20:05.664 --> 20:06.992
Okay, Reg.

20:07.306 --> 20:10.276
I've done something for you.
Why don't you do something for me?

20:10.372 --> 20:13.376
Why don't you tell me
what today is all about?

20:16.808 --> 20:17.769
Reg?

20:25.468 --> 20:27.896
<i>You can withdraw
the feeding tube now.</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:30.638
<i>We'll disconnect at two.</i>

20:39.016 --> 20:41.147
I know what she's thinking in there.

20:41.427 --> 20:42.737
Who, Annie?

20:42.999 --> 20:44.815
Jackie Queen.

20:45.269 --> 20:47.959
She's thinking
we've run out of ideas.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.597
Is there something I should know
about you and Jackie Queen?

20:50.632 --> 20:52.448
She's got it in for the police.

20:52.727 --> 20:54.527
She wants to know
everything about us.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.841
If you've got nothing to hide,
you've got nothing to hide.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.553
Nothing to hide on this one.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.714
The whole city can see
we've got cordons and doughnuts

21:01.767 --> 21:04.299
and now we've sent a helpless plonk.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.265
We're at a very delicate stage of...

21:09.714 --> 21:12.544
Alright, Steve, keep your hat on.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.348
Guten tag, gents.

21:17.418 --> 21:18.780
Morning, Litton.

21:18.872 --> 21:21.152
D'you want me get a bowl
of water for your guide dog?

21:21.857 --> 21:25.177
Regional Crime Squad
should've been notified, Gene.

21:25.311 --> 21:26.854
Tread carefully.

21:27.088 --> 21:28.776
Hey, relax, Sonny Jim.

21:29.279 --> 21:30.922
Big boys are here.

21:34.925 --> 21:36.277
Check your weapons.

21:36.909 --> 21:39.145
Don't do this.
We've got Annie on the inside.

21:39.190 --> 21:41.660
What, you're sending the birds
into battle now, Gene?

21:41.705 --> 21:43.393
Don't wanna get your shoes dirty.

21:43.490 --> 21:45.039
I'm begging you not to do this.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.481
No one can die.

21:46.526 --> 21:49.265
Alright, Cole, this is DCI Hunt.

21:49.332 --> 21:51.076
You're on your last warning!

21:51.119 --> 21:54.864
DCI Litton, Regional Crime Squad.

21:54.942 --> 21:56.485
If you want to play a long game,

21:56.530 --> 21:59.224
that's fine with us,
we're not going anywhere.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.845
Means that I'm threatening you.

22:00.889 --> 22:02.231
We don't want to threaten him.

22:02.510 --> 22:05.115
We can't afford to
lose a single hostage.

22:05.137 --> 22:07.060
What? No one?

22:08.155 --> 22:09.586
Well, there's a thought.

22:09.642 --> 22:10.950
It'll look good in the papers.

22:10.995 --> 22:14.270
Yeah, well, making the front pages
is an occupational hazard.

22:14.382 --> 22:17.657
"RCS diffuse the crisis,
lead everyone to safety"...

22:17.713 --> 22:19.311
yes, I'm liking that.

22:19.486 --> 22:21.460
Maybe we should just shoot him.

22:21.705 --> 22:24.814
- We need to negotiate!
- No, no. Him! Litton.

22:24.954 --> 22:27.102
Nah. Paperwork.
It'd be a bloody nightmare.

22:27.172 --> 22:29.845
I want spam sandwiches and water!

22:30.648 --> 22:33.338
We could let him eat lead instead.

22:33.652 --> 22:37.810
Leave them outside this door
and no funny business!

22:38.159 --> 22:40.971
You've got til two o'clock,

22:41.006 --> 22:44.500
to tell us what you want, Reg.
After that, it's no holds barred.

22:44.578 --> 22:47.722
Don't trust him, Reg, he'll blow
your brains out, given half a chance!

22:47.784 --> 22:51.696
Please! You're jeopardising
everything here!

23:09.439 --> 23:11.657
I'm approaching the door.

23:12.781 --> 23:15.017
I am *not* armed.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.563
I've got sandwiches
and water for you.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.262
I'm gonna unlock the door.

23:23.437 --> 23:26.424
I'm gonna unlock the door
and I'm gonna bring this stuff in.

23:26.721 --> 23:29.061
Okay? I'm not trying
to pull a fast one,

23:29.131 --> 23:31.017
you have my word.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.039
I'm unlocking the door now, Reg.

23:45.594 --> 23:47.480
Reg, I'm inside.

23:56.942 --> 23:59.370
<i>We'll remove his catheter.</i>

24:00.347 --> 24:01.849
<i>Call the nurse.</i>

24:31.626 --> 24:36.097
Perhaps we can talk more
about how all this came about?

24:36.184 --> 24:37.424
You disobeyed me.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.328
I was just trying to help you, Reg.

24:39.433 --> 24:42.001
And if I'm in here, with you,
then I can help you.

24:42.105 --> 24:46.228
What gives you the...
hubris to imagine you can help me?

24:46.490 --> 24:49.145
Okay, let's put it another way.

24:49.477 --> 24:51.188
Let me work with you.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.633
There's a lot at stake here,
Reg, for both of us.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.701
It's over. Drop it.

25:07.823 --> 25:09.011
- Guv...
- Drop.

25:09.064 --> 25:11.124
- The nurse is dead.
- Then so are you.

25:11.212 --> 25:12.522
Guv, put the gun down.

25:12.557 --> 25:14.338
D'you wanna see her brains
all over the wall?

25:14.408 --> 25:16.976
- D'you wanna see your own? Drop it!
- Back away!

25:21.150 --> 25:23.369
You threw away my gun!

25:23.631 --> 25:25.412
I saved her life.

25:25.604 --> 25:28.574
You threw away...

25:28.854 --> 25:29.745
my gun!

25:29.832 --> 25:33.675
You were very wise.
And you were exceedingly stupid.

25:33.998 --> 25:35.692
Give her your key.

25:39.393 --> 25:42.136
Now. Lock the doors.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.608
Oh, Doris!

26:40.995 --> 26:43.004
So what about it, Reg?

26:43.458 --> 26:44.995
Quid pro quo?

26:45.711 --> 26:48.017
I saved that situation just now.

26:48.086 --> 26:49.519
I did that for you.

26:49.624 --> 26:52.157
Can't you do something for me?

26:52.471 --> 26:53.939
Why not?

27:08.419 --> 27:11.668
Should have kept mine, Reg.
Yours looks knackered.

27:11.764 --> 27:15.432
Service revolver. Oiled every day.

27:20.723 --> 27:23.239
Was that supposed
to be a rescue attempt?

27:23.413 --> 27:25.806
You don't do rescue attempts,
do you Gene?

27:25.911 --> 27:30.575
Shut your eyes, come in blasting,
that's your strategy, isn't it?

27:35.728 --> 27:38.191
So, an hour and a half.

27:40.130 --> 27:42.750
Tell me what's so important
about two o'clock.

27:43.012 --> 27:45.615
It's our deadline
for the evening edition.

27:46.837 --> 27:48.043
See...

27:48.794 --> 27:51.257
I'm the front page, Inspector.

27:52.933 --> 27:55.902
"At 8.30 this morning,
an ordinary working man

27:55.955 --> 27:59.204
entered the offices of the
city's most respected newspaper

27:59.274 --> 28:02.033
and took control of it at gunpoint."

28:03.404 --> 28:05.622
I want my story heard.

28:06.527 --> 28:08.396
What is your story?

28:08.518 --> 28:10.736
What you should be
worried about, Inspector,

28:10.893 --> 28:12.850
is how the story ends.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.199
I need to make Doris
more comfortable.

28:17.304 --> 28:20.151
It's too hot for her
here by this radiator.

28:20.326 --> 28:22.422
Can someone help me, please?

28:26.795 --> 28:28.856
Okay, what's it all about, Reg?

28:28.961 --> 28:30.795
Tell me about the article.

28:31.196 --> 28:32.629
Injustice.

28:32.734 --> 28:36.664
Someone, please.
I think we should move her, guv.

28:38.411 --> 28:40.035
What did you say?

28:40.297 --> 28:42.725
Nothing. She needs proper...

28:42.778 --> 28:44.630
What did you say?!

28:45.189 --> 28:47.477
I'm a trained nurse!

28:48.368 --> 28:51.389
Doris is ill. Let her go.

28:51.494 --> 28:53.485
That would be
the honourable thing to do.

28:53.605 --> 28:57.308
Not like dressing a policewoman
up in a nurse's uniform

28:57.404 --> 28:58.522
and sneaking her in,

28:58.551 --> 29:01.604
despite the fact that
you gave me your word!

29:01.779 --> 29:03.997
Oh, come on, Reg, you're a criminal!

29:04.242 --> 29:07.002
You do what you do,
I'm a copper, I do what I do.

29:07.081 --> 29:09.194
Cats eat kippers, dogs eat bones.

29:09.263 --> 29:13.630
All I want is to tell the world
what's in my head.

29:13.823 --> 29:16.443
And just for once have them listen.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.155
I was going to release them,

29:18.242 --> 29:20.006
then I would do what I had to do,

29:20.076 --> 29:23.081
and the world would be left
with my epitaph in the paper.

29:23.325 --> 29:26.609
Not now.
You've dishonoured yourself.

29:26.714 --> 29:29.124
And the price you pay is death.

29:30.959 --> 29:32.496
Two o'clock.

29:32.618 --> 29:33.771
On the dot.

29:33.841 --> 29:36.601
Who's gonna die? All of us?

29:36.723 --> 29:39.709
Look, I could go out there
and plead your case.

29:39.797 --> 29:42.854
You've got grievances. I can put them
to the appropriate authorities.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.731
- What about us, George?
- Jackie, I <i>am</i> this newspaper.

29:48.024 --> 29:50.592
God, I'm sweating pints!

29:52.076 --> 29:57.339
Fear turns us all
into heroes or cowards.

29:59.156 --> 30:03.069
Thing is, we don't know which,
til the moment comes.

30:03.121 --> 30:04.326
I need a drink.

30:06.178 --> 30:08.588
The runners need greasing.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.422
Here.

30:18.788 --> 30:21.147
That is a single malt!

30:21.478 --> 30:23.592
What kind of a monster are you?!

30:24.972 --> 30:27.417
You have your place in society.

30:27.505 --> 30:29.706
- Even he has.
- Oh, I get it.

30:29.767 --> 30:31.234
Old soldier with a grudge.

30:31.304 --> 30:33.941
Wants folk to salute him
as he's walking down the street.

30:34.011 --> 30:34.902
You're annoying me.

30:34.989 --> 30:36.841
You should hang your
head in shame, pal.

30:36.911 --> 30:39.968
Those guns should be used against the
enemy, not against your own people.

30:40.020 --> 30:43.793
- What do you know about this gun?
- What should we know, Reg?

30:46.134 --> 30:50.745
Some people are the living dead,
and don't even know it.

30:51.199 --> 30:53.226
I woke up one morning...

30:53.557 --> 30:55.374
and I realised it.

31:00.824 --> 31:04.701
Well, that was a hell of
a piece of negotiation, Sammy-boy.

31:05.121 --> 31:08.789
Maybe you could talk him into
shooting us both up the jacksie.

31:09.374 --> 31:12.186
He's very clever
and he's very lonely.

31:12.448 --> 31:14.142
There's something else.

31:14.282 --> 31:16.762
Yeah, very armed.
We need to overpower him.

31:16.850 --> 31:19.941
He said fear turns us
into heroes or cowards.

31:20.029 --> 31:22.282
Something he's seen or done,

31:22.596 --> 31:24.902
in the war perhaps.

31:25.530 --> 31:28.080
The way he reacted
when you mentioned the gun.

31:28.342 --> 31:30.805
We've got to find
the key to Reg Cole.

31:30.980 --> 31:33.757
Right now, there's another key
I'd like to get hold of first.

31:34.211 --> 31:37.250
Hatching another
impressive plan, Gene?

31:37.416 --> 31:39.285
You done something
to your hair, Jackie?

31:39.372 --> 31:41.905
- Why?
- Suits you, that's all.

31:42.655 --> 31:44.105
Give us a fag.

31:54.147 --> 31:55.929
Get back in here!

31:59.790 --> 32:02.043
What is it with you and that Jackie?

32:03.493 --> 32:06.148
She's a harpy, end of story.

32:07.685 --> 32:10.113
Do you make friends
everywhere you go?

32:11.738 --> 32:13.624
She wants me.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.912
Poor bitch.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.412
Where did you get that extra water?

32:37.499 --> 32:39.700
Full vase of flowers.

32:46.473 --> 32:48.412
He's testing himself.

32:49.408 --> 32:50.683
And us.

32:51.381 --> 32:54.298
"Mr Cole was infuriated beyond reason

32:54.350 --> 32:56.761
with the injustices of a cheap world,

32:56.866 --> 32:58.858
obsessed with easy glory.

32:58.945 --> 33:01.460
A world that honours the profane,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.762
and delights in the
sanctity of the self.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.609
It is far too florid, Reg.

33:07.923 --> 33:12.256
Our readers would've skipped down to
the bit about you shooting everyone.

33:12.483 --> 33:15.348
"This frightening day
ended in a nuclear explosion

33:15.417 --> 33:18.806
of desperate bloodshed, as Cole, 59-
- 55!

33:19.067 --> 33:21.862
...finally unleashed
his pent-up fury."

33:23.233 --> 33:25.451
I'll get the Carnegie award for this.

33:26.063 --> 33:28.403
Posthumously, of course.

33:28.787 --> 33:31.250
How many'd you kill
during the war, Reg?

33:31.408 --> 33:34.307
Not enough? None at all?

33:34.429 --> 33:36.630
Feeling unappreciated?

33:37.539 --> 33:39.250
"Mr Cole...

33:39.617 --> 33:42.814
was a man of unique intelligence,

33:43.093 --> 33:45.801
who never felt appreciated.

33:46.499 --> 33:52.332
He saw poetry and prose
as a celebration of life.

33:52.612 --> 33:55.773
He saw in literature
all the good things.

33:56.123 --> 33:57.520
Courage...

33:57.887 --> 34:01.031
fortitude, sacrifice.

34:02.935 --> 34:05.502
But in his daily life, he saw...

34:05.694 --> 34:08.733
cowardice, selfishness,

34:08.873 --> 34:11.527
a desire for cheap glory.

34:12.366 --> 34:14.585
And so he felt alone.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.829
You're in the wrong institution,
Inspector Tyler.

34:19.022 --> 34:20.856
You don't know the half of it.

34:20.943 --> 34:23.877
- I'm not lonely.
- No, but you feel...

34:24.226 --> 34:25.380
isolated.

34:25.467 --> 34:28.594
Like the Connecticut Yankee
in the court of King Arthur.

34:30.864 --> 34:33.206
A man out of time.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.398
Stranded in a heathen world.

34:44.996 --> 34:47.737
Which is why you
have to prove yourself.

34:48.646 --> 34:51.351
You know,
none of this would've happened,

34:51.429 --> 34:53.746
if you'd managed to get
yourself laid once in a while.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.118
Shut up, Hunt.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.301
'least I have the guts
to tell it to his face.

34:57.397 --> 35:00.593
I don't hide behind
tomorrow's chip paper.

35:02.917 --> 35:04.995
Oh my God. Help!

35:06.620 --> 35:08.035
She needs help!

35:09.170 --> 35:11.615
I need a mirror, has anyone got-

35:14.689 --> 35:16.453
Think she had a heart attack.

35:16.541 --> 35:20.733
I can do mouth-to-mouth but
I need someone who can perform CPR.

35:21.074 --> 35:22.628
Can you help her?

35:34.776 --> 35:37.046
You can do it,
Doris, come back to us.

35:37.099 --> 35:38.618
Come on, you're missing all the fun.

35:38.688 --> 35:39.841
She's gone.

35:40.296 --> 35:42.898
You can do it, fight!

35:44.121 --> 35:46.025
Fight! Fight!

35:51.069 --> 35:52.291
Good girl!

35:52.414 --> 35:54.580
I had never seen
that technique before.

36:02.107 --> 36:04.221
Why don't you let her leave?

36:04.518 --> 36:07.732
Or any of them?
What have they done to you, Reg?

36:28.084 --> 36:29.656
Thank you, Reg.

36:47.551 --> 36:48.634
George...

36:57.469 --> 36:59.792
I could write your biography, Reg.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.836
It would make a fascinating read.

37:01.906 --> 37:03.705
They could turn it into a film.

37:03.810 --> 37:06.343
Richard Burton'd be
a dead spit for you.

37:06.838 --> 37:08.532
You'll be immortal.

37:09.283 --> 37:11.327
Let me go and I'll do this for you.

37:11.519 --> 37:13.336
You're interested in me?

37:13.476 --> 37:14.559
Really?

37:16.026 --> 37:17.144
It's a Monday.

37:17.249 --> 37:18.716
You normally play golf.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.847
Your clubs are behind the coat stand.

37:20.951 --> 37:22.802
You always bring them in Friday.

37:22.942 --> 37:24.671
Over the weekend,
they have to be moved

37:24.724 --> 37:27.484
so that someone can clean
all the corners in your office.

37:27.763 --> 37:31.152
You're always surprised that they've
changed position over the weekend.

37:31.973 --> 37:33.894
You stay late every night.

37:34.017 --> 37:37.597
- To write the front page!
- Only you don't, does he, Jackie?

37:37.807 --> 37:39.379
You sit in the office,

37:39.501 --> 37:43.186
and you climb into the Scotch bottle
while Jackie does all the work.

37:43.238 --> 37:45.544
Only she never gets
her name on the front page.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.046
Eventually you stumble off
and she's left to it.

37:49.204 --> 37:52.051
And she accepts this because, well...

37:52.243 --> 37:53.728
it's the way it is.

37:53.850 --> 37:56.837
In the morning, someone
turns up at the crack of dawn,

37:56.924 --> 38:00.627
to empty the bin in your office,
get rid of the evidence.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.758
Preserve your respectability.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.208
Who are you?

38:05.326 --> 38:06.846
And you Jackie.

38:07.195 --> 38:10.636
Don't you ever wonder,
after you've worked late again,

38:10.776 --> 38:13.946
who left the light on in the stairwell
so you don't trip up in the dark?

38:14.051 --> 38:15.658
I don't understand.

38:16.112 --> 38:18.628
Don't you usually wear
your red skirt on Mondays?

38:18.716 --> 38:21.563
- Are you spying on us?
- I work here!

38:21.668 --> 38:23.362
Eight years!

38:23.869 --> 38:26.140
I fix the locks on those doors.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.829
I help bring in the
new filing cabinets.

38:28.987 --> 38:32.970
I mend the electrics,
tend the grounds, clean the windows.

38:33.109 --> 38:34.926
I am here!

38:35.048 --> 38:39.223
Just hoping that my little
efforts will be noticed.

38:39.555 --> 38:41.686
If we're all the same underneath,

38:42.280 --> 38:45.040
why do <i>you</i> have a place in life?

38:47.617 --> 38:50.866
Let me live.
I've learnt me lesson.

38:50.988 --> 38:52.787
You feel powerless.

38:52.910 --> 38:55.442
I can understand that, Reg.

38:55.652 --> 38:58.097
Feel like you've been written off
and you've got...

38:58.202 --> 39:00.159
so much to give.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.111
But you made a difference!

39:04.228 --> 39:05.591
What about...

39:06.255 --> 39:07.984
What about the war?

39:08.386 --> 39:09.399
The war?

39:09.504 --> 39:11.199
Yes, Reg. The war.

39:11.268 --> 39:13.888
Days when you could actually
look at yourself in the mirror.

39:13.993 --> 39:15.635
You don't understand.

39:15.722 --> 39:19.670
I understand that right now, you're
not honouring what you fought for.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.342
You can still back away from this.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.150
You can still walk away
with your honour.

39:30.779 --> 39:32.962
Don't move any further, George.

39:33.067 --> 39:35.198
Sit down, George!

39:35.320 --> 39:36.980
You're not a killer.

39:37.539 --> 39:39.740
You're just... angry.

39:40.385 --> 39:42.656
An underappreciated hero.

39:42.971 --> 39:44.752
That's what you are, Reg.

39:44.961 --> 39:46.061
Now...

39:47.179 --> 39:48.664
I'm leaving.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.686
I'm gonna walk down the fire escape.

40:02.928 --> 40:05.112
Okay, George, let me see.

40:05.408 --> 40:07.696
How does it feel to shoot someone?

40:07.818 --> 40:09.949
Is it how you imagined it?

40:17.943 --> 40:20.108
You weren't there, were you?

40:20.475 --> 40:22.816
You never went to war.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.506
You wanted to, though.

40:33.437 --> 40:35.673
You have a deadline to meet!

40:39.168 --> 40:40.583
Okay, Jackie.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.622
Just take a deep breath.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.041
Count the number of steps
from there to your desk.

40:48.792 --> 40:51.849
Just relax. Think you can do that?

40:53.525 --> 40:54.853
Good girl.

41:07.207 --> 41:09.443
You know,
I thought I could reach him.

41:10.316 --> 41:12.237
But he's totally insane.

41:12.866 --> 41:14.840
I'm glad you noticed.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.831
This is gonna be a bloodbath.

41:16.884 --> 41:18.805
You're wasting your time, guv.

41:24.386 --> 41:26.098
Trust the Gene Genie.

41:27.251 --> 41:28.578
Hold still.

41:29.364 --> 41:32.369
The door that leads to the fire escape
is out there in that corridor.

41:32.404 --> 41:34.779
- Do you think we can get them out?
- Maybe.

41:34.884 --> 41:37.557
Well, we can either
sit here waiting to die,

41:37.731 --> 41:39.600
or we do it.

41:45.144 --> 41:46.698
Carry on writing.

41:46.891 --> 41:48.253
I feel sick.

41:48.428 --> 41:49.668
Write.

41:50.297 --> 41:52.078
Better keep going, Jackie.

41:55.755 --> 41:58.200
I think you need to come out here,
mate, we need some help.

41:58.252 --> 41:59.755
It's the guv.

42:01.100 --> 42:04.401
I think it might be something
he ate for his breakfast.

42:04.505 --> 42:07.143
He's allergic to fatty foods.

42:07.422 --> 42:09.990
Low carbs only, he needs fresh fruit.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.942
- It's happened before.
- Will he wake up?

42:13.849 --> 42:15.806
I don't want you to miss this.

42:15.928 --> 42:17.395
What'll revive him?

42:18.233 --> 42:20.198
Punch to the face.

42:20.439 --> 42:21.508
Run!

42:22.950 --> 42:25.177
Go for the fire exit!

42:46.284 --> 42:47.485
Bastard!

42:47.638 --> 42:49.363
- Gene...
- It's okay, love.

42:49.472 --> 42:50.476
Enough!

42:52.987 --> 42:54.581
Miss Queen.

42:54.756 --> 42:56.961
I have a new ending for your article.

42:57.049 --> 42:58.380
"At 2pm today,

42:58.468 --> 43:01.961
the hostages were forced to witness
the execution of three police officers,

43:02.022 --> 43:07.036
as reprisals against a...
a pointless escape attempt."

43:31.208 --> 43:33.182
Are we gonna die now?

43:37.006 --> 43:39.242
No, I reckon we could take him.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.879
I'll jump on him, you take his gun

43:42.071 --> 43:44.272
and Cartwright can jump
up and down on his knackers.

43:44.325 --> 43:46.857
Free the hostages,
get down the pub, no problem.

43:47.731 --> 43:49.583
Well, that's a relief.

43:52.273 --> 43:54.998
For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.

44:01.582 --> 44:05.581
When you die, there's supposed
to be this tunnel of light

44:05.756 --> 44:10.105
and you get to relive all your
very best and most wonderful moments.

44:12.481 --> 44:15.346
Go on then, Cartwright.
Give us an example.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.495
Graduation day.

44:22.927 --> 44:26.595
Jumping off a twenty
foot bridge into a weir,

44:26.752 --> 44:30.193
with a bottle of Mateus
Rose in one hand...

44:34.421 --> 44:35.766
Go on...

44:36.918 --> 44:39.224
With a bottle of wine in one hand,

44:39.521 --> 44:41.477
and me bra in the other.

44:42.176 --> 44:45.896
I think that's just become
one of *my* dying memories.

44:50.105 --> 44:51.887
And you, Sam?

44:57.414 --> 44:59.755
I suppose the day I was...

44:59.912 --> 45:01.973
...made a DCI.

45:02.305 --> 45:05.694
Is that the same day
I became King of Egypt?

45:06.078 --> 45:09.223
Oh, yeah, sorry, yeah.

45:09.607 --> 45:12.087
The day I was made <i>DI</i>.

45:12.296 --> 45:15.772
Is that the best you can do?
Something to do with work?

45:21.327 --> 45:22.654
Birthday.

45:25.327 --> 45:27.807
My last birthday.

45:28.227 --> 45:30.707
No, no, actually, it wasn't my last,

45:30.829 --> 45:32.611
what I mean is, it was...

45:33.694 --> 45:35.720
my fourth birthday.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.353
My dad was away a lot. Salesman.

45:40.506 --> 45:43.563
And I woke up that morning,
and I remember thinking,

45:44.209 --> 45:46.567
"Is he gonna be here, is he gonna be...

45:47.179 --> 45:49.501
...downstairs?"
- And was he?

45:49.763 --> 45:53.589
And I went down, and my mum
was waiting in the living room.

45:54.253 --> 45:56.611
And she said, "I'm so sorry, Sammie.

45:57.485 --> 45:59.738
He couldn't make it back in time."

46:01.886 --> 46:03.895
I was gutted.

46:05.135 --> 46:06.916
And I just stood there...

46:09.222 --> 46:11.563
and then I heard this whistling.

46:12.454 --> 46:14.480
For He's A Jolly Good Fellow.

46:16.734 --> 46:18.603
And he came into the room.

46:19.424 --> 46:22.166
I didn't turn round,
'cause I just wanted to...

46:24.577 --> 46:26.149
savour...

46:27.686 --> 46:29.119
that moment.

46:30.463 --> 46:32.507
Knowing that he was there.

46:37.484 --> 46:39.790
I don't think about my past.

46:40.348 --> 46:41.536
Come on.

46:41.973 --> 46:43.789
There must be some...

46:43.947 --> 46:49.292
juicy bit of Gene Hunt heroism
buried in there somewhere.

46:50.313 --> 46:52.462
What, you think this job's heroic?

46:54.051 --> 46:56.619
We clean out the gutters,
that's what we do.

46:56.986 --> 46:58.663
It's a thankless task.

46:59.187 --> 47:02.453
Don't tell me you don't
feel good about what you do.

47:02.680 --> 47:05.702
Ask Jackie Queen if
she thinks we're heroic.

47:05.824 --> 47:09.073
What is it with her?
She wrote a piece about you...

47:11.361 --> 47:14.033
An armed blag at a post office.

47:15.151 --> 47:17.055
This bloke had a gun

47:18.034 --> 47:20.374
and was running towards the crowd.

47:21.457 --> 47:24.182
It wasn't a gun, though, was it?

47:24.323 --> 47:25.860
It was a stick.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.397
He was unarmed.

47:27.484 --> 47:28.955
Jackie, what- what's happening?

47:29.052 --> 47:31.609
I'm going to the loo.
Reg is counting.

47:31.679 --> 47:34.222
When he gets to fifty,
he shoots George.

47:34.334 --> 47:35.158
Again.

47:35.689 --> 47:38.750
He was a wee kid with
a wooden stick, Gene.

47:39.196 --> 47:40.692
You shot him in the back.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.620
He was running towards the crowd.

47:42.690 --> 47:45.149
We'd been in a siege
situation for hours.

47:45.225 --> 47:47.553
If he'd been armed,
he could've killed the lot of them.

47:47.595 --> 47:49.789
I had to make a decision,
woman, in a second.

47:49.859 --> 47:51.382
And you nailed me for it.

47:51.955 --> 47:55.113
You turned it into a hatchet
job and I had to live that down.

47:55.211 --> 47:57.041
The looks I got from
people on the street!

47:57.139 --> 47:59.710
It was covered up. No enquiry.

47:59.822 --> 48:03.176
All the Gazette ever asked
for was greater police accountability.

48:03.273 --> 48:05.900
You also asked for my head
on a plate and that was wrong.

48:06.166 --> 48:09.017
Let me tell you for the record,
I am not the villain of the piece.

48:09.087 --> 48:10.596
I'm not like Litton, Jackie,

48:10.652 --> 48:12.790
I don't need to see
myself on the front page.

48:12.860 --> 48:15.487
I don't deserve to be
shown supping with the devil!

48:15.626 --> 48:18.337
Why are you here?
Is that what you came over for?

48:18.449 --> 48:19.357
No.

48:21.677 --> 48:23.228
He's reached forty.

48:23.564 --> 48:25.276
I've got to go.

49:00.495 --> 49:02.452
<i>Where are you?</i>

49:21.409 --> 49:23.575
The van's arrived, for the typesetters.

49:24.588 --> 49:26.510
We're ready to go to press.

49:28.082 --> 49:30.213
I know you wanna be a hero.

49:30.405 --> 49:32.658
I saw what you wrote in your flat.

49:33.339 --> 49:34.457
Brecht.

49:34.772 --> 49:37.549
"Unhappy the land that has no heroes"

49:37.794 --> 49:39.488
That's half the quote.

49:39.628 --> 49:41.776
"Unhappy the land that has no heroes.

49:41.846 --> 49:45.846
No, unhappy the land
that needs heroes."

49:47.139 --> 49:48.728
I don't understand.

49:49.183 --> 49:53.305
If you fail to be a hero,
be content to be a villain.

49:55.226 --> 49:58.283
- And that's the point of all this?
- In the end, yes.

49:58.493 --> 50:02.144
I tried to be a heroic nobody.
Didn't work.

50:02.702 --> 50:05.183
So now I'm a famous villian.

50:05.288 --> 50:07.279
If you kill us,

50:07.698 --> 50:10.685
they will come in here
and they will kill you.

50:11.017 --> 50:12.711
I die famous.

50:13.515 --> 50:15.349
You die coppers.

50:39.865 --> 50:42.625
I don't think you really
wanna be a villian, Reg.

50:44.092 --> 50:47.638
I think it's fear
that's made you do this.

50:48.075 --> 50:50.625
No point in you trying to be a hero.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.752
No one to save. Not even yourself.

50:55.044 --> 50:56.896
I'm not trying to be a hero.

50:57.036 --> 50:58.905
You're deluded, Sam.

50:59.149 --> 51:03.097
You're breathing, your heart's beating,
but it's an illusion of life.

51:03.254 --> 51:04.774
You're dead already.

51:05.473 --> 51:07.901
Time to put you out of your misery.

51:10.887 --> 51:12.913
Bye, Annie.

51:19.949 --> 51:22.360
When you're done with him,

51:22.500 --> 51:26.500
you'd better turn on me quick,
Cole or I'll kill you.

51:27.599 --> 51:29.241
Two o'clock.

51:39.486 --> 51:41.756
<i>And I didn't turn around...</i>

51:42.386 --> 51:44.185
<i>because I knew my dad was home.</i>

51:44.377 --> 51:47.067
<i>Sammie! Big boy now, eh!</i>

51:50.726 --> 51:52.682
It's over, Cole!

51:52.839 --> 51:54.673
You've met your match!

51:54.761 --> 51:56.857
No! Sir, no!

51:59.634 --> 52:00.996
Put the gun down, Reg.

52:03.896 --> 52:05.695
Somebody call an ambulance!

52:12.097 --> 52:13.599
He can't be...

52:13.879 --> 52:15.573
It wasn't supposed to...

52:15.713 --> 52:17.564
Someone dies, two o'clock...

52:22.154 --> 52:24.163
What's that all over him?

52:26.521 --> 52:28.041
Scotch.

52:28.582 --> 52:30.102
He's bleeding whisky.

52:30.259 --> 52:32.198
That was the guv's collar.

52:32.565 --> 52:34.119
I want that known.

52:34.870 --> 52:36.268
Have you got that?

52:40.455 --> 52:44.402
And I want Love Me Tender
played at my funeral.

52:47.966 --> 52:49.642
That was lucky, eh?

52:51.884 --> 52:54.242
What are the chances?

52:56.443 --> 52:58.155
Pretty good, actually.

52:58.399 --> 53:00.862
You never know how far
you're gonna be from a boozer!

53:01.281 --> 53:02.539
Watch out!

53:07.393 --> 53:09.315
No, stop, stop!

53:14.939 --> 53:16.371
What would he say?

53:17.262 --> 53:20.196
What would he say,
the man whose pistol that is?

53:22.921 --> 53:25.436
That's a hero's pistol, Reg.

53:27.986 --> 53:29.261
Come on.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.593
Gimme the gun.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.100
It's over.

53:46.908 --> 53:49.004
Nobody dies today.

54:06.204 --> 54:09.573
He assaulted a fellow senior officer.

54:09.738 --> 54:12.078
DCI Litton was a target.

54:12.183 --> 54:15.571
For a second, I didn't see a copper,
only a helpless victim.

54:15.694 --> 54:18.629
I positioned DCI Litton on
the floor in order to protect him.

54:18.716 --> 54:20.515
Would you say that was fair,
Miss Queen?

54:20.620 --> 54:22.890
Wait for the evening edition, Mr Hunt!

54:22.979 --> 54:25.075
I'm serious,
I don't want to see a hatchet job.

54:25.179 --> 54:28.131
I don't do hatchet jobs. I do my job...

54:28.341 --> 54:29.721
just like you.

54:30.438 --> 54:34.158
The guv took a shot to
the chest in the line of duty.

54:34.280 --> 54:37.162
Luckily, he had the foresight
to be wearing protection.

54:37.231 --> 54:40.079
Well, I'm a great believer
following standard procedure

54:40.148 --> 54:42.996
in a hostage-taking scenario.

54:51.064 --> 54:52.968
I just cheated death.

54:53.037 --> 54:54.260
What?

54:54.767 --> 54:57.492
They didn't switch me off. Why?

54:58.557 --> 55:01.736
Sam? Do me a favour.

55:03.151 --> 55:05.212
Enjoy the moment.

55:14.818 --> 55:16.111
Good lad.

55:16.704 --> 55:18.504
Cheers.

55:24.038 --> 55:27.165
Here we go, boys and girls,
we've made the evening edition.

55:27.322 --> 55:30.501
I propose we batton down the
hatches and spend the week in here.

55:31.689 --> 55:35.079
Can someone book me on the
first flight to Jamaica, *please*!

56:01.898 --> 56:03.895
<i>I'm telling you for the last time,</i>

56:03.947 --> 56:05.798
<i>I don't care what your machine says!</i>

56:05.938 --> 56:07.755
<i>I'm leaving him on!</i>

56:08.506 --> 56:12.244
<i>You say you can't detect anything,
but I know what I saw!</i>

56:12.681 --> 56:16.087
<i>At two o'clock,
on the dot, I saw Sam smile!</i>

56:16.209 --> 56:18.183
<i>I saw him smile!</i>

56:18.550 --> 56:20.802
<i>Operator, can I connect you?</i>

56:21.105 --> 56:23.621
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I was just connected.

56:30.870 --> 56:34.608
So tell me, between you and me, guv,

56:34.835 --> 56:36.949
how does it feel to be a hero?

56:38.416 --> 56:40.478
Like being drunk.

56:40.705 --> 56:42.259
On myself.

56:58.958 --> 57:02.155
