03:45.893 --> 03:47.426
That was a really great take.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.794
It wasn't. I was late on the
second movement.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.996
Right.

Your manager's just
arrived, so why

03:52.366 --> 03:53.799
don't we all take five, yeah?

04:00.908 --> 04:02.908
I thought you were in Berlin.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.709
I was.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.982
Rose, I have some--

04:09.984 --> 04:11.950
I have some bad news.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.454
I spoke with your
notary on the phone.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.357
Your father is dead.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.391
I'm so sorry.

Are you OK?

Mr. Gilford wasn't able
to tell me anything more

over the phone, but we're
supposed to meet him

I also apologize for the
way you were informed

05:13.380 --> 05:15.480
of your father's demise.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.483
Well, actually, I had no idea
whether he was alive or dead.

05:18.485 --> 05:23.455
From the little I knew of him,
I'm amazed he lived this long.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.657
We weren't exactly close.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.994
When was the last
time you saw him?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.963
Uh, 1993.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.900
He left when I was 14 months.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.502
My French counterpart,
Monsieur Zurah,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.838
informed me of his death.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.740
According to him, you
are the one and only

05:41.742 --> 05:44.576

05:44.578 --> 05:46.945
Richard Marlowe, the composer?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.381
Mm-hm.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.682
You're the daughter
of Richard Marlowe?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.017
You never told me?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.018
I didn't tell you
anything about my father.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.852
But I thought--

05:53.854 --> 05:56.588
Not now, Charles.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.623
Uh, there's no will.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.126
You inherit the copyrights
of his entire body of work,

I'm afraid there's
very little money.

Let me get this straight.

I am obliged to give

06:21.382 --> 06:22.914
you these myself.

06:22.916 --> 06:28.153
In there are the property

Forgive my curiosity,
but was Mr. Marlowe famous?

07:07.528 --> 07:10.162
Not famous so
much as notorious--

07:10.164 --> 07:12.464
the kind of composer
an up-and-coming

07:12.466 --> 07:14.566

in order to show off,

07:14.568 --> 07:17.569
show they were in the know.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.571
Back in the '80s, he
composed a symphony that

07:19.573 --> 07:20.972
caught the critics off-guard.

07:20.974 --> 07:24.643
He became trendy, I suppose.

07:24.645 --> 07:28.513
Some hailed him as the leader of
a new generation of composers--

07:28.515 --> 07:30.849
a savior of British
classical music,

07:30.851 --> 07:36.054
which he might have become
if he hadn't disappeared.

had been an accident,

some form of foul play.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.235
[laughs]

07:50.237 --> 07:52.170
Ends up he was just
in France rotting

07:52.172 --> 07:53.538

07:57.478 --> 08:00.045
There's something I
should probably mention.

No.

No, not that.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.591
More a moral one.

08:15.596 --> 08:19.130
Mr. Marlowe committed
suicide in the most

08:19.132 --> 08:21.933

08:21.935 --> 08:24.102
How?

that in front of Rose.

she's actually very emotional.

good and clients that are OK,

12:16.870 --> 12:18.803

the passable are dropped.

24:50.223 --> 24:50.921
Oh.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.523
It's OK.

24:52.525 --> 24:55.860
Look, I just want the
best for you, that's all.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.628
Now, if you feel I'm
holding you back--

24:57.630 --> 24:58.963
No, I am--

24:58.965 --> 25:03.000
I'm frustrated, but I
didn't mean to lash out.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.735
I think I just need
some time alone.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.570
I understand.

25:06.572 --> 25:10.574
So this house, what's it like?

25:10.576 --> 25:13.978
Old, creepy, isolated.

25:13.980 --> 25:14.979
I like it.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.046
It reminds me of you.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.014
[laughs]

25:17.016 --> 25:18.182
Lovely.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.650
How are you holding up?

25:19.652 --> 25:21.752
Did you learn anything
about your father?

25:21.754 --> 25:25.022
Well, that's actually what
I wanted to tell you about.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.892
I think that he was working
on something before he died--

25:27.894 --> 25:29.226
a sonata.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.160
Sonata?

25:30.162 --> 25:33.664
You mean a finished one?

25:33.666 --> 25:35.099
I think so.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.734
But it's really weird
because some of the staves,

25:36.736 --> 25:40.137
they begin with symbols
that I've never seen before.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.839
What kind of symbols?

25:41.841 --> 25:43.807
I can't describe them.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.242
Perhaps if I send
you some pictures--

25:45.244 --> 25:47.177
do you think you'd have
time to have a look at them?

25:47.179 --> 25:48.879
Of course.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.849
Rose, you do know if this
is your father's final work,

25:51.851 --> 25:54.985
it could be a huge sensation.

25:54.987 --> 25:58.122
Yes, well, that much
had occurred to me.

25:58.124 --> 26:01.759
And if this score was more
important to him than I was,

26:01.761 --> 26:03.327
I'd like to know why.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.763
Hm.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.631
I've got to go.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.800
I'll send you the
pictures as soon as I can.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.568
Sure thing.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.335
Keep me posted.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.102
ROSE (ON PHONE): Will do.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.304
Bye.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.705
Oh, and-- and
there's one last thing.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.574
CHARLES (ON PHONE): Yes?

26:16.576 --> 26:18.175
You wouldn't happen
to know how he died?

26:18.177 --> 26:19.577
Your father?

26:19.579 --> 26:20.811
No.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.646
No.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.782
Did you find anything?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.083
No.

26:26.085 --> 26:26.884
OK.

26:26.886 --> 26:27.751
Talk soon.

26:32.091 --> 26:35.593
[ominous music]

27:21.207 --> 27:23.374
INTERVIEWER: Mr. Marlowe,
good evening, and thank you

27:23.376 --> 27:25.743
for granting us this interview.

27:25.745 --> 27:29.279
We are aware it is not really
in your habit to do so.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.148
Over the course of the
last three or four years,

27:31.150 --> 27:34.385
you have gone from being an
obscure, shall we say, composer

27:34.387 --> 27:38.288
to being the face of a brave
new era of classical composers.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.091
And yet an equal
number of detractors

27:41.093 --> 27:44.161
find your music
too old-fashioned.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.664
You know, the concept
of old-fashioned

27:46.666 --> 27:48.766
means very little to me.

27:48.768 --> 27:52.670
I don't judge a piece
of art by its period.

27:52.672 --> 27:56.907
If Mozart were alive, he would
meet the same silly criticism.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.442
Ha.

27:58.444 --> 28:02.379
I don't write music
to please anyone.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.815
It's not entertainment.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.985
It floats around,
whispering inside me.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.887
I heard it from
the day I was born,

28:09.889 --> 28:14.091
and it will be there
long after I die.

28:14.093 --> 28:19.797
It holds the key
to the human heart.

28:19.799 --> 28:23.801
Its real voice has
no written words,

28:23.803 --> 28:29.873
and it reveals darkness,
sadness, joy, longing.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.776
It's magic.

28:32.778 --> 28:33.977
INTERVIEWER: By the
sound of things,

28:33.979 --> 28:37.881
you seem to be entrusted
with a mission.

28:37.883 --> 28:44.188
I just follow the
voice that I hear.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.090
INTERVIEWER: God?

28:46.092 --> 28:46.957
Something like that.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.161
INTERVIEWER: What
of your future work?

28:51.163 --> 28:54.264
Can you tell us a
little bit about it?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.433
I started years ago.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.069
It's still not finished.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.905
But it will be one day.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.976
INTERVIEWER: And do you
think it will affect people?

29:05.978 --> 29:12.116
It will touch
someone, I think.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.519
[suspenseful music]

29:15.521 --> 29:19.089
[thunder crashes]

29:20.526 --> 29:24.061

31:06.131 --> 31:06.630

31:55.547 --> 31:56.513

32:03.155 --> 32:06.523
[clock strikes loudly]

32:44.496 --> 32:48.065
[dramatic violin music]

32:50.269 --> 32:52.269
Ugh.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.603
Bloody French.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.133
[speaking french]

34:03.509 --> 34:07.044
[suspenseful music]

34:24.396 --> 34:25.295
Charles?

34:25.297 --> 34:26.830
James.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.433
Thank you so much for coming.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.467
What wouldn't I do
for my former agent.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.136
Yeah.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.438
I know you're performing a
concert tomorrow evening,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.607
but I'm in desperate
need of your expertise.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.409
I'll have a pint
of lager, please.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.143
Same again.

34:43.549 --> 34:44.748
Since when do you drink water?

34:44.750 --> 34:45.581
[laughs]

34:45.583 --> 34:47.484
I'm on the wagon--

34:47.485 --> 34:49.152
for good, this time.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.121
These damn things make me
fall asleep half the time,

34:51.123 --> 34:52.722
but they really help.

34:52.724 --> 34:53.857
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.596
So, tell me about
this piece of music

34:59.598 --> 35:00.730
that you want me
to have a look at.

35:00.732 --> 35:01.431
Yeah.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.737
What can you tell me about this?

35:13.679 --> 35:17.747
Well, it would appear
to be a violin sonata.

35:17.749 --> 35:23.253
And it's composed on the basis
of a fairly regular structure,

35:23.255 --> 35:24.254
but it's quite uneven.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.393
I mean, the quality it, uh--

35:30.395 --> 35:33.897
it changes drastically
depending on the passage.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.233
It's fairly coherent.

35:36.235 --> 35:40.237
But the first, the third,
and the fifth movement here--

35:40.239 --> 35:42.139
they are magnificent, they are.

35:42.141 --> 35:45.375
They're truly
magnificent, in fact.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.776
Who wrote this?

35:46.778 --> 35:48.378
I'm not at liberty to say.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.813
Oh, Charles, you tease.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.747
Come on.

35:50.749 --> 35:51.515
I must know.

35:51.517 --> 35:52.415
Sorry, James.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.384
I have to keep schtum.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.886
But I will say this.

35:55.888 --> 35:59.656
It's going to be huge
when it goes official.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.459
About bloody time, Charlie.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.895
The elusive big break, eh?

36:04.897 --> 36:07.464
It's better late than never.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.399
Yeah.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.801
Right now, I need you to help
me decipher these symbols.

36:11.803 --> 36:15.472
Do they mean anything to you?

36:15.474 --> 36:18.608
In all honesty, I have
never seen anything like it

36:18.610 --> 36:20.544
before in my life.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.947
I mean, perhaps there's
some kind of a key beginning

36:23.949 --> 36:25.649
of each stave--

36:25.651 --> 36:28.885
you know, like a way they
code the score or something?

36:28.887 --> 36:30.587
That would certainly
explain the poor quality

36:30.589 --> 36:32.889
of certain passages.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.726
It's almost as if the composer
has done this on purpose

36:36.728 --> 36:40.263
so that nobody would be
able to decipher the score.

36:40.265 --> 36:40.797
Hm.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.602
Charles, no one understands
more than me the need

36:45.604 --> 36:47.470
for secrecy in this business,
but if you don't tell me

36:47.472 --> 36:49.973
who wrote this, it's going to be
really hard for me to help you.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.647
OK, James.

36:57.649 --> 37:04.254
But I need your word
you won't tell anyone.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.657
Absolutely.

37:07.659 --> 37:11.695
It's Richard
Marlowe's last work.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.497
The Richard Marlowe?

37:14.499 --> 37:17.267
The crazy, eccentric
savior of classical music

37:17.269 --> 37:19.336
who disappeared to listen
to the voices in his head?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.403
The very same.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.339
I thought he died years ago.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.408
No, last week.

37:25.410 --> 37:29.312
Well, that would explain it.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.680
[clears throat]

37:34.253 --> 37:35.952
Thank you.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.823
Look, you have my word
I won't tell anybody, OK?

37:39.825 --> 37:41.491
Do you know anyone
who can help me out?

37:43.929 --> 37:46.396
I can think of one person.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.664
Yeah.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.699
He worked with Richard
Marlowe for years.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.501
Truth be told, he was the
only one that Marlowe ever

37:51.503 --> 37:53.937
really tolerated being around.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.339
If he can't help
you, no one can.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.475
But he won't really appreciate
me giving out his number

37:58.477 --> 37:59.709
to a complete stranger.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.477
Come on, James.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.946
You owe me this.

38:02.948 --> 38:03.647
Please?

38:07.519 --> 38:08.918
OK.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.720
I'll have to call ahead and
let him know that you're

38:10.722 --> 38:13.023
going to be in touch.

38:13.025 --> 38:15.292
He doesn't really
like new people.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.662
[suspenseful music]

38:55.033 --> 38:58.601
[child screams]

39:01.640 --> 39:04.574
[children screaming]

39:12.017 --> 39:13.583
[doorbell rings]

39:18.623 --> 39:19.823
Charles Vernais.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.891
I have an appointment
with Sir Victor.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.094
Follow me, please.

39:24.096 --> 39:24.928
Thank you.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.864
[birds chirping]

39:28.900 --> 39:29.733
VICTOR: Monsieur Vernais.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.037
Pleasure to meet you.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.105
Pleasure's all
mine, Sir Victor.

39:35.107 --> 39:37.807
And thank you for your time.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.510
Please, sit down.

39:40.512 --> 39:44.748
Meredith, if you'd be so kind
as to bring us some tea, please.

39:44.750 --> 39:45.882
MEREDITH: Right away, sir.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.050
Oh, and, Meredith?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.718
MEREDITH: Yes, Sir Victor?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.687
Preferably not the disgusting
concoction my daughter

39:50.689 --> 39:52.422
gave me, if you'd be so kind.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.026
She's new.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.596
I see.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.831
Are you writing a new book?

40:01.833 --> 40:03.733
Uh, indeed.

40:03.735 --> 40:08.838
The third and final volume of
the history of baroque music.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.475
I must confess that your
visit offers me an unexpected

40:12.477 --> 40:14.544
and quite welcome break.

40:14.546 --> 40:19.149
So, Monsieur Vernais,
what can an old man

40:19.151 --> 40:21.451
like myself do for you?

40:21.453 --> 40:23.453
I came to ask you
some questions about--

40:28.693 --> 40:31.060
about this.

40:31.062 --> 40:35.064
It was composed by
Richard Marlowe.

40:35.066 --> 40:35.799
I see.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.074
The sonata.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.977
I'm sorry?

40:47.979 --> 40:50.213
I never thought
he'd finish it.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.014
You've heard of this?

40:53.819 --> 40:56.052
He used to speak of
it as his life's work.

41:00.459 --> 41:04.928
Now, let's see.

41:04.930 --> 41:08.698
It should go something like--

41:08.700 --> 41:12.001
[plays the sonata]

41:14.973 --> 41:18.475
[distant growling]

41:25.183 --> 41:28.551
It's delightful.

41:28.553 --> 41:32.789
Might I be so bold as to ask
how you acquired this work?

41:32.791 --> 41:35.625
I-- it's confidential.

41:35.627 --> 41:36.893
There are other parties.

41:36.895 --> 41:37.794
I see, I see.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.665
Well, go on.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.101
The problem is that
the music is so erratic,

41:45.103 --> 41:47.537
and then there are
these strange symbols.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.087
Do these look familiar?

42:07.559 --> 42:11.194
They are the same.

42:11.196 --> 42:16.699
These symbols were created
by a French secret society

42:16.701 --> 42:18.268
back in the 19th century.

42:18.270 --> 42:22.305
Now, each symbol represents
one of four different aspects

42:22.307 --> 42:26.776
of a code, which,
when joined together,

42:26.778 --> 42:32.148
create the symbol of
the Famulus Order.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.883
Meredith?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.318
Does one have to be
Her Majesty the Queen

42:35.320 --> 42:37.220
to get a simple cup of tea?

42:37.222 --> 42:40.056
MEREDITH: It's coming, sir.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.792
I'm trying to work out
whether she is mentally retarded

42:42.794 --> 42:46.095
or just maliciously slow.

42:46.097 --> 42:51.801
The members of the Famulus Order
were, uh, perverted successors

42:51.803 --> 42:54.337
of the Romantic Movement--

42:54.339 --> 42:56.272
noblemen, artists.

42:56.274 --> 43:00.009
What-- what does it
have to do with music?

43:00.011 --> 43:03.713
They were convinced that music
has the capacity of unlocking

43:03.715 --> 43:05.715
portals between worlds.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.350
I'm sorry, portals?

43:07.352 --> 43:11.254
Doors, openings, gaps in
the fabric of the cosmos.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.889
I understand,
sir, I understand.

43:12.891 --> 43:16.726
It's just that--
so-- so this order,

43:16.728 --> 43:19.762
they believed that music
had a kind of magic?

43:19.764 --> 43:21.364
Absolutely.

43:21.366 --> 43:26.235
Not metaphorically, or as part
of some illusion or trick.

43:26.237 --> 43:29.672
They believed that music
had real, tangible power.

43:29.674 --> 43:31.341
W-- what kind of power?

43:31.343 --> 43:37.780
Well, they believed that if
the notes were properly aligned

43:37.782 --> 43:42.285
and played with exactly
the right pitch,

43:42.287 --> 43:44.754
they could conjure and
seduce the Antichrist.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.626
By playing music?

43:49.628 --> 43:50.960
More or less.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.896
Their theory was based
on one simple belief--

43:53.898 --> 43:57.767
one does not address
the devil with words.

43:57.769 --> 44:02.338
Only music would allow mortals
to communicate with him

44:02.340 --> 44:04.907
and understand his divinity.

44:04.909 --> 44:05.842
The Antichrist, sir?

44:05.844 --> 44:07.677
[laughs]

44:09.981 --> 44:13.650
This is no joke,
Monsieur Vernais.

44:13.652 --> 44:17.720
CHARLES: These symbols, do you
think they can be deciphered?

44:17.722 --> 44:19.389
Of course.

44:19.391 --> 44:23.192
Marlowe was fascinated
by the order.

44:23.194 --> 44:25.161
He probably found
the inspiration

44:25.163 --> 44:27.363
in it to code his own work.

44:27.365 --> 44:29.232
You seem to have
known him quite well.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.867
Were the two of you close?

44:30.869 --> 44:31.868
Close?

44:31.870 --> 44:33.336
To Marlowe?

44:33.338 --> 44:35.204
You must be joking.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.006
That man was the
very incarnation

44:37.008 --> 44:40.143
of pride, ruthless and cruel.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.679
I very much doubt he
was close to anyone.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.213
But the two of
you worked together.

44:44.215 --> 44:47.016
Surely you must have appreciated
each other's company.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.018
Well, don't misunderstand me.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.020
He was a terrific composer.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.423
One couldn't help but
be impressed by him.

44:53.425 --> 44:57.827
He was devoted to his work
and would have sacrificed

44:57.829 --> 45:04.300
everything for his music, apart
from, perhaps, his little Rose.

45:08.306 --> 45:11.340
Don't be so surprised,
Monsieur Vernais.

45:11.342 --> 45:13.810
You can't possibly think that
I would allow you into my home

45:13.812 --> 45:16.913
without knowing
everything about you?

45:16.915 --> 45:18.247
It's not that I--

45:18.249 --> 45:21.084
well, she's not exactly
aware of my being here.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.952
And truth be told,
she doesn't speak

45:22.954 --> 45:24.721
very highly of her father.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.289
It's funny.

45:26.291 --> 45:30.093
He loved those flowers
so much, he named

45:30.095 --> 45:33.796
his own daughter after them.

45:33.798 --> 45:37.066
Believe me, if the
rest of the score

45:37.068 --> 45:38.835
is as good as the
opening passage,

45:38.837 --> 45:42.205
and given Marlowe's talent,
you may very well be holding

45:42.207 --> 45:44.507
an absolute masterpiece.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.809
This is going to
seem rather forward,

45:46.811 --> 45:50.847
but would you mind if I borrowed
your book on the Famulus Order?

45:50.849 --> 45:53.750
Well, I can't see why not.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.418
Thank you very much for
your time, Sir Victor.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.321
I'll bring the book back
as soon as possible.

45:58.323 --> 46:01.257
I have no doubt of it.

46:01.259 --> 46:04.827
[suspenseful music]

46:26.818 --> 46:30.186
[distant growling]

46:31.222 --> 46:32.221
Oh!

46:32.223 --> 46:35.792

51:29.454 --> 51:31.454
CHARLES: C'est un
fenetre de merde.

51:31.456 --> 51:32.455
Charles?

51:32.457 --> 51:34.557
No, it's Santa Claus.

51:34.559 --> 51:35.724
Oh, my god.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.393
What the hell are
you doing here?

51:37.395 --> 51:39.361
Yeah, great to see you too.

51:39.363 --> 51:41.197
You scared the hell out of me.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.232
Why are you coming in
through the window?

51:43.234 --> 51:44.667
You weren't
answering your phone.

51:44.669 --> 51:47.536
You've locked the front
door shut, so I improvised.

51:47.538 --> 51:49.238
Why are you here?

51:49.240 --> 51:52.241
I thought a little
company wouldn't harm you.

51:52.243 --> 51:55.678
Plus, I brought a couple of
things you and I can work on.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.513
[fire crackling]

51:57.515 --> 52:00.749
By researching information
about this French sect,

52:00.751 --> 52:04.453
I discovered the leader used to
live here in this very house.

52:04.455 --> 52:10.659
Your father was fascinated
about their beliefs.

52:10.661 --> 52:12.428
I discovered that the
symbols of the sonata

52:12.430 --> 52:16.532
correspond to what they
call the four faces of evil.

52:16.534 --> 52:18.767
[ominous music]

52:20.138 --> 52:22.805
The first symbol
represents power.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.441
The second, immortality.

52:25.443 --> 52:28.344
The third, appearance.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.280
And the fourth, duality.

52:31.282 --> 52:36.218
United, they form the symbol of
evil, which is also the symbol

52:36.220 --> 52:38.921
of the Famulus Order.

52:38.923 --> 52:42.892
Your father left clues for
you here in this very house.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.314
Brilliant.

53:08.719 --> 53:11.754
This one represents power.

53:11.756 --> 53:13.389
And I found another
one just like it.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.732
CHARLES: Immortality.

53:28.339 --> 53:29.772
It doesn't work anymore?

53:29.774 --> 53:31.674
I turned it off
because of the noise.

53:31.676 --> 53:32.775
And it was an hour late, anyway.

53:37.815 --> 53:39.882
There's got to be a
logic behind all this.

53:39.884 --> 53:41.951
If these symbols are
placed where they are,

53:41.953 --> 53:44.520
it must be for a good reason.

53:44.522 --> 53:47.456
Hm.

53:47.458 --> 53:50.426
Well, the symbol in the
chimney only appears

53:50.428 --> 53:51.427
when the flames rise up.

53:57.001 --> 53:58.467
Could it be that if--

53:58.469 --> 53:59.468
It's worth a try, isn't it?

54:16.554 --> 54:17.553
Lemon juice.

54:17.555 --> 54:20.522
(LAUGHING) Kid stuff.

54:20.524 --> 54:23.525
Which means that the
objects the symbols appear on

54:23.527 --> 54:25.928
affect the way the
music is deciphered.

54:25.930 --> 54:29.331
The symbol on the clock
represents immortality.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.567
It must have a kind
of link with time.

54:31.569 --> 54:33.836
When I found it, it was an
hour behind on French time.

54:36.741 --> 54:41.977
And when I played this,
it didn't sound right.

54:41.979 --> 54:45.748
Maybe if we shift
the notes forward,

54:45.750 --> 54:49.618
making them a time late, it'll
give something more coherent.

54:49.620 --> 54:51.887
Yes, that would seem logical.

54:51.889 --> 54:53.722
[ominous music]

54:53.724 --> 54:55.391
Hm.

54:55.393 --> 54:56.725
Are you OK?

54:56.727 --> 54:57.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:57.862 --> 54:58.694
It's just a headache.

54:58.696 --> 55:00.429
I'm fine.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.463
Are you sure?

55:01.465 --> 55:02.331
I said, I'm fine!

55:05.503 --> 55:07.636
We must look for all the
clues left by your father.

55:07.638 --> 55:10.506
One must be appearance,
the other, duality.

55:13.778 --> 55:15.711
Any ideas?

55:15.713 --> 55:17.313
Have you seen the
size of this place?

55:17.315 --> 55:18.480
It could be anywhere.

55:18.482 --> 55:19.815
Then there's no time to lose.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.884
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

55:21.886 --> 55:24.553
I mean, even if I knew--

55:24.555 --> 55:25.721
Therese.

55:25.723 --> 55:27.089
Therese?

55:27.091 --> 55:28.490
Who's Therese?

55:28.492 --> 55:29.925
My father had a cleaning lady.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.427
She knows this place perfectly.

55:31.429 --> 55:32.761
Maybe she knows something.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.596
In that case, we have
to go see her and ask

55:34.598 --> 55:36.498
her the right questions.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.733
You should go.

55:37.735 --> 55:38.801
You speak better French than me.

55:38.803 --> 55:39.968

55:40.671 --> 55:42.404

Rose, what's going on?

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:49.551
Rose, what's-- what's wrong?

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:50.886
What's wrong?

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.420
Inside the chapel
in the woods,

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:53.889
children have been killed.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:54.890
We have to call the police.

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:56.692
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.493
What are you talking about?

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.294
Under the chapel,
there-- there's a room

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:02.998
which has torture devices.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.199
What are you talking about?

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.201
(CRYING) He recorded
them screaming.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.102
Rose?

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:07.669
Rose, for god's sake--

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.592
Let go of me!

01:05:08.593 --> 01:05:09.514
We have to call the police!

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:10.436
Hey, tell me what
the hell is happening.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.606
[panting]

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.074
Listen to me, listen.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.376
I don't know what you
think you've seen,

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.012
but right now I want
you to calm down, OK?

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:17.646
Deep breath.

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:19.180
Just take a moment.

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:20.382
Listen to me, I'm here now.

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:21.900
I'm protecting you.

01:05:21.901 --> 01:05:23.417
I want you to wait until your
breathing's under control,

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.552
and then you take
it from the top.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.154
Good?

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.256
Now, these children, are
there bodies, bones, what?

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:32.928
No, I saw some
shadows in the woods.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.030
No, but I heard
them on the tapes.

01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:37.132
What tape?

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:39.367
He was torturing them,
and he recorded it.

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:41.002
Ro, do you think
your father would

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:43.438
have been capable of
doing something like that?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.674
I don't know.

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:47.575
I don't know.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:50.512
But there was this--

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:53.481
this wall painting with
some kind of demon on it.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.018
I'm not crazy!

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.619
Go and see for yourself!

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.386
OK, Rose, OK.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:05:59.154
I believe you.

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:00.522
I believe you.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:01.690
I'm sure whatever
you've seen down

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.191
there has given
you quite a fright,

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.726
but let's not jump to
any conclusions yet.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.094
Don't patronize me, Charles.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:07.128
I'm not!

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.431
I'm-- I'm trying to help you.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:11.266
I've always been there for
you, and I'm here right now.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.388
Look, I came over to
see you because I've

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:09.257
discovered a great deal of
things about your father.

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:11.426
I've been led to
believe that he had a--

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:14.496
drink up-- he had
a strange taste

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.698
for morbid folklore,
which doesn't mean he

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.299
actually did anything morbid.

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:21.102
It could simply be an
artistic approach-- a way

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.238
to immerse himself
in a fantasy world

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.641
to capture what he needed
to achieve with his music.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:30.311
And believe me, he wouldn't
be the first to do so.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.713
Take Schumann, for instance.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:34.582
Schumann found inspiration
in voices from above,

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.284
and Tartini, from the devil.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.519
[chuckles]

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.220
It doesn't mean they
were psychopaths.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.289
Well, you weren't there.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.190
You didn't see what I did.

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.161
I don't want to
stay here anymore.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.429
I want to go back to London.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:48.830
So that's it, huh?

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:50.698
You want us to leave
now, let the whole thing

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.435
go when we're so close?

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:56.104
Do you realize what this
music could represent for us?

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:57.572
What do you mean "us"?

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.674
Why do you think he sent
you the key to this place?

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:01.376
Hm?

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:03.211
If we're able to
decipher this sonata,

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.646
we'll own the rights to it.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.414
Think about it.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:10.718
Young virtuoso violinist plays
her long-lost father's work.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.520
Look, I'm not saying we
shouldn't call the police.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.689
I'm just asking you to give me
at least five minutes to tell

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:18.326
you what I've discovered.

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:23.331
Thanks to Therese, I found
the symbol for appearance.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:27.202
The way I see it, this means
the score has to be played

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.604
in reverse, like in a mirror.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:34.209
I don't think
this is a good idea.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:35.542
I think we have to
destroy the score.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:44.118
Could we-- could we, before
taking any rash decisions,

01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:47.388
think this through
calmly, please?

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.424
We only have two
more symbols to find.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:51.693
Two.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.497
One, actually.

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:58.399
[suspenseful music]

01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.167
CHARLES: Charity.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:08:59.667
Of course.

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.538
Let's get back inside.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:05.473
Yeah, let's go.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:28.229
Now, if-- if we juxtapose them
like the statues, we should--

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:29.531
et voila.

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:30.631
I knew it.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:31.899
[laughs]

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.935
Last, but not least, we
have to find the symbol

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:35.737
that unites them all.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:42.676
It's the symbol of the Famulus
Order in the [inaudible] score.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.645
Charles, we--

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:45.947
You look terrible.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.381
You should rest.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:50.518
We have to destroy the score.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.687
CHARLES: Do me a favor, Rose.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.889
Go get some sleep.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.426
[ominous music]

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.300
Who's there?

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:13.908
Charles?

01:10:17.747 --> 01:10:19.280
[muttering]

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:08.830
[button clicks]

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.398
[tape rewinding]

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.733
[button clicks]

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.969
MARLOWE (ON TAPE):
Recording number two.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:19.807
For the beast will only speak
through the mouths of the pure,

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.909
the uncorrupted--

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.845
those who have
only known God's--

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.380
[button clicks]

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:26.314
[tape rewinding]

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:29.301
[button clicks]

01:11:29.302 --> 01:11:32.287
For the beast will only speak
through the mouths of the pure,

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.355
the uncorrupted--

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:37.058
those who have only
known God's love.

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:56.878
[ominous music]

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:09.357
[suspenseful music]

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.364
What were you
thinking, old man?

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.550
VICTOR (VOICEOVER): He loved
those flowers so much--

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:39.520
He named his own
daughter after them.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.923
Ah.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:45.493
[ominous music]

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.871
CHILD (ON TAPE): [screams]

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.843
[howling and screaming]

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:49.791
[door creaks]

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:53.161
Charles?

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:58.766
What are you doing?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:13:59.767
[tape clicks off]

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.903
It's absolutely phenomenal.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.838
Once the symbol's
deciphered, it's pure genius.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:09.177
Your father was a genius.

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.745
This score is going
to change the way

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:12.480
we consume music forever.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.188
What's going on?

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.023
I've realized something.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:24.992
All these years living
here away from the world--

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:25.993
it's all for you.

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:27.728
He wrote the sonata for you.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:28.696
What do you mean?

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:29.931
All of this was planned.

01:14:29.933 --> 01:14:31.599
He had everything
worked out, probably

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.534
before you were even born.

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.470
The last symbol
points to you, Rose.

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:36.537
The final staves are empty.

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:37.672
You have to fill them.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.240
It's up to you to
finish his work.

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:41.709
Why do you think he wrote
the sonata for violin?

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:44.245
Whether you want it or not,
you're part of his work.

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.247
It's our duty to
make this music reach

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:47.682
people's ears all
over the world,

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:48.683
and you have to be
the one to play it.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.385
But that's--

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:52.086
Rose, whether you like it
or not, it's your legacy.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:53.855
You can't deny it.

01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:55.056
That music is wrong.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:56.257
Oh-ho.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.892
It's so much more
than simply music.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.927
It's evil, Charles.

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:00.912
Don't you hear it?

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:01.896
The children were screaming!

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.098
They were being
tortured for that music!

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.066
[chuckles]

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.501
I know.

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:08.903
Their sacrifice was
a necessary evil.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.838
The voices coming out of
those children's mouth,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.240
it's magnificent.

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:14.775
They're pure, like you.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:16.010
Listen to you.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.745
I don't even recognize you.

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:19.647
The music is making
you go crazy.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.849
Can't you see?

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.050
This is the very reason he
cast you aside all these years.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:27.989
This sonata can only be played
by pure, uncorrupted souls.

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.257
The book says so.

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:31.058
That is you, Rose.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.060
He left you because he knew-- he
knew he would have tainted you.

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:36.264
He saved you--
saved you for this.

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.798
Well, I don't
want any part it.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.302
You don't have a choice.

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:46.073
The only thing that
matters now is the music.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.842
What are you doing?

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:49.176
What I should
have done before.

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:51.679
I'm burning these pages
and going to the police.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.313
Ah!

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:53.982
Ugh!

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:55.650
I've always protected you,
nurtured you, and for what?

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:57.184
So you could leave?

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.120
So you could get out into the
world and leave me behind,

01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:00.821
forget I ever existed?

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:02.156
I've given you so much,
and all you've done

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.191
is throw it at my face.

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:06.227
You don't even realize
how lucky you are.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.262
If I had but only the
slightest hint of your talent,

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:10.698
I wouldn't have had
this shitty life.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.266
This sonata is the
key to my success.

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:14.869
And for once in your miserable
life, you will listen to me

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:16.170
and do as I fucking say.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.839
Got it?

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:22.209
[wheezing]

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:43.197
Play it.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.098
Charles--

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:44.865
I need to hear it.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:51.672
It keeps coming back in my head.

01:16:51.674 --> 01:16:53.708
It's unbearable.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:54.609
Charles, please--
