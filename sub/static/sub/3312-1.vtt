WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:09.710
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.080
- JOE, WHERE ARE MY SHOES?
- BOX IN THE CORNER

00:12.113 --> 00:14.582
MARKED "MEL'S CRAP I
KEEP TRIPPING OVER."

00:14.615 --> 00:17.218
( gasps ) MY BABIES!

00:17.251 --> 00:20.354
AWWW! THESE SHOULD BE IN A BOX MARKED
"THINGS I LIKE BETTER THAN YOU."

00:20.388 --> 00:22.223
AND IT WOULD BE A
REALLY BIG BOX.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.392
IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN TAKE IT
ALL OUT ON ME. I CAN HANDLE IT.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.495
I'VE GOT THICK SKIN. IT'S CURRENTLY
COVERED IN THREE MONTHS' OF DRYWALL DUST.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.064
( phone ringing )

00:31.765 --> 00:33.734
HEY. YEAH. I'M STILL
GETTING DRESSED.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.636
I'LL BE ON MY WAY IN 10 MINUTES.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.139
WHAT? THE REPORTERS ARE LEAVING?
WELL, TELL THEM TO WAIT!

00:38.172 --> 00:40.508
YOU... I DON'T KNOW.
THROW DONUTS AT THEM.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.410
NOT THE CRULLERS THOUGH!

00:42.443 --> 00:44.745
SURE, I DON'T MIND HOLDING.
HERE, RYDER, YOU HOLD.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.448
- NO, I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
- MULTITASK!

00:48.816 --> 00:50.618
FINE. I CAN HOLD BOTH.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.388
WHERE WAS I? OH YES,
ANNOYED WITH YOU.

00:54.422 --> 00:58.126
IT'S A RENOVATION. YOU KNOW THERE
ARE ALWAYS MINOR INCONVENIENCES.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.494
YEAH, MINOR TO THE PERSON
WHO'S NOT HERE ALL DAY LONG.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.697
NOT SO MINOR TO THE GUY WHO
HAS TO UNPLUG THE COFFEEMAKER

01:03.731 --> 01:06.167
IN ORDER TO HOOK
UP THE MICROWAVE.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.337
NOT SO MINOR TO THE GUY WHO HAS TO
BREATHE IN PAINT FUMES ALL DAY LONG,

01:09.370 --> 01:12.206
NOT TO MENTION WHATEVER'S COMING OUT
OF THAT PORTA-POTTY IN THE BACKYARD.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.776
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU CARE? I MEAN YOU
SPEND ALL DAY IN A NICE AIR-CONDITIONED OFFICE

01:15.809 --> 01:19.680
GIVING OUT KEYS TO THE CITY, YOU
KNOW BANGING ON YOUR, UM... GAVEL.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.650
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I DO, DO YOU?
- NO, NOT A CLUE.

01:22.683 --> 01:26.154
YEAH, JOE, YOU'RE FORGETTING WHAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT ALL THIS:

01:26.187 --> 01:30.624
I AM FINALLY GETTING MY DREAM HOUSE...
EXCEPT YOU'RE IN IT.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.461
- BESIDES, WE'RE OVER THE HUMP.
- NO.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.663
NO, I THINK WE'RE ALL
STILL GETTING HUMPED.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.098
YEAH, I WISH.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.704
...THAT THERE WAS MORE CEREAL.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.841
OKAY, COME ON, AUNT MEL. IT
WOULD BE NICE IF ONE DAY

01:47.875 --> 01:49.843
OUR KITCHEN WAS ACTUALLY
IN THE KITCHEN.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.380
AND I WASN'T SHARING
A ROOM WITH JOE.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.315
OH, YOU THINK I LIKE SHARING
A ROOM WITH LENNOX?

01:54.348 --> 01:57.785
WELL, I DO! AND HERE'S
THE PRETTY GIRL NOW.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.288
YOU STEPPED ON MY HEAD ON THE
WAY TO THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.190
SEE, TOE PRINTS?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.458
YOU GET TO GO TO THE BATHROOM?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.760
WOW, WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

02:06.794 --> 02:09.163
COME ON, EVERYBODY. LET'S
JUST ROLL WITH THIS.

02:09.197 --> 02:12.466
JOE, I KNOW YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH
LEO, BUT AS CONTRACTORS GO...

02:12.500 --> 02:14.735
- HE GOES SLOWLY.
- DROP IT, JOE, ALL RIGHT?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.437
I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU
WHEN I HAVE A BREAK.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.574
UH, MEL, UH, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

02:20.608 --> 02:24.144
TO WORK, LEO, TO TALK TO REPORTERS
ABOUT THE CITY'S NEW BIKE LANES

02:24.178 --> 02:26.480
AND BANG MY GAVEL.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.749
BUT YOU CAN'T GO. THE
TRENCH GUY IS HERE.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.220
AND WHEN HE STARTS DIGGING, HE
COULD HIT TREE ROOTS, A GAS LINE,

02:32.253 --> 02:34.688
MUMMIFIED HUMAN REMAINS.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.824
IT HAPPENS. THE POINT IS

02:36.857 --> 02:39.193
THE HOMEOWNER HAS TO SAY
GO LEFT OR GO RIGHT.

02:39.227 --> 02:43.130
- CAN'T WE JUST RESCHEDULE?
- OKAY, BUT THIS GUY ISN'T AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER...

02:43.163 --> 02:46.166
- THREE TO 12 WEEKS.
- THREE TO 12? WHAT KIND OF WINDOW IS THAT?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.736
AUNT MEL, SHE SAYS THE
REPORTERS ARE LEAVING.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.571
WHAT?! NO NO NO NO NO, OKAY.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.541
SACRIFICE THE CRULLERS. ALL
RIGHT, DON'T DO ANYTHING YET.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.709
I... ( growls ) DAMN, MY
TWO WORLDS ARE COLLIDING.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.645
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PICK ONE.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.680
IT'S LIKE "SOPHIE'S CHOICE,"

02:59.713 --> 03:01.815
IF SOPHIE WERE
RENOVATING HER KITCHEN.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.817
COME HERE, BURKE.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.887
I'M GONNA SUGGEST SOMETHING TO YOU THAT I
SHOULD HAVE SUGGESTED A LONG TIME AGO.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.890
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO DOWNTOWN AND
LET ME MANAGE THIS CONSTRUCTION JOB?

03:09.923 --> 03:11.892
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.761
SIMPLE: I LIKE
THINGS DONE MY WAY.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.696
I CAN DO YOUR WAY, ONLY BETTER.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.731
COME ON, I'M, LIKE,
MADE FOR THIS JOB.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.767
I'M HERE ALL DAY LONG.
I KNOW CONSTRUCTION.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.871
I LIKE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO,
YOU KNOW, ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.506
YEAH, BUT I NEED
TO BE IN CHARGE.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.808
I LIKE CONTROLLING THE
THINGS THAT ARE MINE.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.944
MEL, I GOT FIVE GUYS OUT THERE WAITING.
WHERE SHOULD WE DIG?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.514
SOPHIE, YOUR CHOICE.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.518
TALK TO...

03:38.586 --> 03:40.421
TALK TO JOE.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.855
SEE? NOW DID THAT HURT?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.425
( sighs ) LIKE
TWEEZING MY TOE HAIRS.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.194
( theme music playing )

03:47.227 --> 03:49.830
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

03:49.863 --> 03:52.433
♪ WITH ME ♪

03:58.506 --> 04:01.609
I AM A CITY COUNCIL GODDESS.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.845
SEVEN YAYS, NO NAYS. THERE
WILL BE BIKE PATHS.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.947
AND CUTE GUYS IN BIKE SHORTS.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.982
CAN I GET A "NICE BUTT"?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.951
SPEAKING OF BUTTS,

04:10.984 --> 04:12.920
I'VE BEEN BUSTING
MINE ALL DAY LONG.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.589
YOU KNOW THAT SILK GRANITE SINK
THAT THEY SAID WE COULDN'T GET?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.725
WELL, GOT IT. I HAD LEO
PULL IT OFF ANOTHER JOB.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.661
WHOO HOO! I MEAN HOW
TERRIBLE FOR THEM.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.031
- WOULD IT KILL YOU TO JUST SAY THANK YOU?
- HMM, WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.869
I AM AWESOME BEYOND
HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.871
I KNEW YOU TWO WERE
SHARING A ROOM,

04:30.904 --> 04:32.940
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU TWO
WERE SHARING AN EGO.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.911
YOU KNOW THAT PLAY I WROTE? THE
DRAMA CLUB IS GOING TO PRODUCE IT.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.580
OH, THAT'S GREAT! WHICH PLAY?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.982
THE ONE-ACT I GAVE YOU
GUYS TO READ A WEEK AGO.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.785
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF IT?
- OH, THAT ONE.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.921
IT'S SO GOOD.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.991
I MEAN IT'S, LIKE, AMAZING
HOW YOU GOT ALL THAT PLAY

04:51.024 --> 04:53.761
INTO THAT ONE LITTLE ACT.
RIGHT, JOE?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.929
OH YEAH. LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, LENNOX,

04:55.963 --> 04:58.031
YOU REALLY, UM...

04:58.065 --> 05:00.701
YOU REALLY WROTE THAT THING.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.035
THANK YOU!

05:02.069 --> 05:04.738
WE'RE CASTING IT TOMORROW SO
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.543
- HEY, DID YOU READ YOUR SISTER'S PLAY?
- OF COURSE.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.580
- I'M A GOOD PERSON.
- WHAT? DON'T JUDGE ME.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.914
- SOME PEOPLE WORK.
- I WORK.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.716
THIS SANDWICH
DIDN'T MAKE ITSELF.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.385
YOU'RE RIGHT... I MADE IT.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.753
TELL YOU WHAT? HOW ABOUT I
WRITE YOU GUYS A SUMMARY

05:19.787 --> 05:22.390
SO YOU CAN FAKE IT THROUGH
YOUR NEXT CONVERSATION BETTER?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.725
YOU REALLY THINK
I'VE SUNK THAT LOW?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.427
'CAUSE I HAVE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.997
HOW COME YOU CAN THANK HIM
BUT YOU CAN'T THANK ME?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.432
HMM, FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.967
SO HOW DID THE
TRENCH DIGGING GO?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.504
WAIT WAIT, WAS IT BAD?
DO I NEED A DRINK FIRST?

05:36.537 --> 05:39.106
- WOULDN'T YOU HAVE A DRINK ANYWAY?
- YEAH, I WOULD.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.412
IT'S 6:00, WHAT ARE LEO'S
GUYS STILL DOING HERE?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.046
BIBLE STUDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.050
- THEY ALWAYS GO HOME AT 5:00.
- NEW REGIME.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.086
EVERYBODY WORKS TILL IT GETS DARK. I
HAVE TO GET THIS JOB BACK ON SCHEDULE.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.755
THE INDULGING AND
CODDLING STOPS NOW.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.525
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE UP
TIME IF EVERYBODY'S BURNED OUT?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.827
I DON'T KNOW. THEY CAN
SLEEP ON THE DRIVE HOME.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.096
YOU KNOW, I FIND THAT IF YOU TREAT
PEOPLE BETTER, THEY WORK BETTER.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.065
IF YOU WANT THIS JOB
DONE IN YOUR LIFETIME,

06:05.098 --> 06:08.001
LET YOUR CONTRACTION
MANAGER DO HIS JOB.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.405
"JOSEPH P. LONGO,
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER"?

06:11.439 --> 06:13.641
YEAH... EMBOSSED. YOU SEE THAT?

06:13.674 --> 06:16.610
SO BLIND PEOPLE WILL KNOW
YOU HAVE A FAKE JOB?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.612
MAKE ALL THE FUN YOU WANT.
YOU'LL SEE HOW I TURN

06:18.646 --> 06:20.347
THIS JOB AROUND IN THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.817
( sighs ) WHATEVER. I AM GOING
UPSTAIRS TO READ IN THE TUB.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.686
- THERE'S NO WATER UP THERE, MEL.
- YEAH?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.621
WELL, COLD PORCELAIN
TURNS ME ON.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.665
- Leo: HEY, JOE, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
- SURE.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.834
- WHAT'S UP, LEO?
- YEAH, CAN YOU GIVE THESE TO MEL?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.437
COPPER PRICES ARE WAY UP,

06:43.471 --> 06:45.506
SO THE PLUMBING BID'S
GOING TO BE 15% MORE,

06:45.539 --> 06:47.675
SHE JUST NEEDS TO INITIAL
THE PRICE INCREASE.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.010
- I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.
- GREAT.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.013
THOSE INITIALS ARE
GOING TO BE "N.O."

06:53.046 --> 06:56.684
YOU BID THE JOB AT ONE PRICE AND
THAT'S THE PRICE WE'RE PAYING, BUDDY.

06:56.717 --> 07:00.020
- BUT THE PRICE WENT UP.
- WHEN'D YOU PUT THE ORDER IN ON THE COPPER?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.989
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M CALLING MEL.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.092
I'M NOT PAYING FOR
YOUR MISTAKES, PAL.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.563
- YEAH, MEL BURKE, PLEASE.
- MEL BURKE, PLEASE.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.066
- IT'S LEO CALLING ABOUT THE KITCHEN.
- IT'S JOE CALLING ABOUT LEO.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.537
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, BUDDY.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.972
OH HEY, MEL?

07:19.006 --> 07:22.476
YEAH LISTEN, A LITTLE PROBLEM.
I JUST...

07:22.510 --> 07:25.012
THAT IS ALL HANDLED. THANK YOU, MEL.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.115
THAT WON'T END WELL.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.151
WE'RE NOT PAYING A DIME MORE THAN THE
ORIGINAL BID, ALL RIGHT? PERIOD.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.053
- JOE, YOU'RE CUTTING INTO MY PROFIT.
- WELL, TOO BAD.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.489
IF YOU CAN'T DO IT, I'LL JUST
FIND SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.090
BELIEVE ME, THAT'LL
CUT INTO YOUR PROFIT.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.160
- I DON'T LIKE TO BE THREATENED.
- I DON'T LIKE TO BE BLACKMAILED.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.095
- BLACKMAIL?!
- I'M SORRY, MY APOLOGIES.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.464
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
DOING HERE IS EXTORTION.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.768
YOU'RE NUTS! I DON'T NEED TO
WORK FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.437
JOSEPH P. LONGO, I QUIT.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.606
OH HO HO HO!

07:52.640 --> 07:54.875
OH, YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.145
OH!

07:58.178 --> 08:00.213
LOOK AT ALL THAT.
PAPER IS EVERYWHERE.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.115
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART, HUH?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.885
I GOT A WHOLE BOX OF
THESE RIGHT HERE.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.661
HEY, GUYS, AUNTIE'S HOME.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.129
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I NEED TO VENT.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.800
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY ENJOYED TODAY'S
VENT, SO I'M GONNA HEAD UPSTAIRS.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.468
UH NO, YOU'RE MY WITNESS.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.704
YOU HAVE TO VALIDATE HOW
TERRIBLY I'VE BEEN TREATED.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.039
OKAY, HIT ME WITH
YOUR DRAMA STICK.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.843
I... SHE JUST...

08:29.877 --> 08:31.144
( growls )

08:31.178 --> 08:33.146
UH, YEAH, I'LL TRANSLATE.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.048
HER PLAY GOT CENSORED
BY THE PRINCIPAL.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.050
OH, SO SHE CUT A FEW THINGS?

08:37.084 --> 08:41.021
- SHE CUT THE ENTIRE PLAY.
- WOW, THAT'S A BIG CUT.

08:41.054 --> 08:44.892
YEAH, AND NOW WE CAN'T PERFORM IT...
FOR TOTALLY ARBITRARY REASONS.

08:44.925 --> 08:48.862
BUT YOUR PLAY'S SO SWEET.
ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE...

08:48.896 --> 08:52.232
- WHERE...
- THE POWER-MAD PRINCIPAL GETS TORN APART BY WOLVES?

08:52.265 --> 08:55.002
YES! WHAT?! YOU WROTE THAT?

08:55.035 --> 08:58.171
DAMN STRAIGHT! THANKS
FOR READING IT.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.874
OKAY, TELL ME WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE.
GIVE ME THE BULLET POINTS.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.743
SO AN EVIL HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL

09:02.776 --> 09:04.978
IMPRISONS HER STUDENTS AND
CUTS OUT THEIR TONGUES.

09:05.012 --> 09:09.617
AND THEN ONE DAY SHE SUDDENLY REALIZES
HER ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN SPENT

09:09.650 --> 09:11.819
SILENCING THE VOICES
OF THE INNOCENTS.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.988
IN REVULSION OF WHAT SHE'S DONE,
SHE WANDERS OFF INTO THE WOODS

09:15.022 --> 09:17.057
- AND...
- THE WOLVES RIP HER LIMB FROM LIMB

09:17.090 --> 09:19.760
AND SHE BLEEDS LIKE
A FIRE HYDRANT.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.662
THAT'S MY FAVORITE PART.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.832
SO YOU FED YOUR PRINCIPAL
TO THE WILD ANIMALS.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.967
ALLEGORICALLY.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.969
SWEETIE, YOU CAN'T
WRITE STUFF LIKE THAT.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.905
I HAVE TO! I CAN'T JUST
WATCH WHILE PRINCIPAL LUNDT

09:31.939 --> 09:33.774
TURNS THE SCHOOL
INTO A POLICE STATE.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.843
SHE INSTITUTED RANDOM
LOCKER SEARCHES.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.178
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED
ABOUT THE OPEN-TOE SHOE BAN.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.581
LENNOX, AS MUCH AS I SUPPORT
THE RIGHT TO BARE TOES,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.283
I CAN'T SUPPORT YOU ON THIS ONE.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.119
- WHAT HAPPENED TO MY COOL AUNT MEL?
- COOL AUNT MEL

09:46.153 --> 09:48.088
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE
YOU GET EXPELLED.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.792
LUNDT CAN'T LET YOU PERFORM SOMETHING
LIKE THAT AT SCHOOL. IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.093
WELL YEAH.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.796
LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO GO TO COLLEGE,

09:55.829 --> 09:59.132
YOU KNOW? SO YOU'RE NOT LIVING HERE FOR THE
REST OF YOUR LIFE, AS DELIGHTFUL AS YOU ARE.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.802
- ( drill whirring )
- WOW, JOE'S REALLY CRACKING THE WHIP.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.271
- THOSE GUYS ARE HERE LATE.
- OH NO, THERE'S NO GUYS.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.306
- THAT'S JUST JOE.
- JUST JOE?!

10:06.339 --> 10:08.942
DON'T WORRY, AUNT MEL. JOE
SAID IT WAS ALL GOOD.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.744
- WHAT?
- NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.113
OH MY GOD! JOE?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.949
OH, HEY, MEL, DOES THIS
CABINET LOOK LEVEL TO YOU?

10:15.983 --> 10:19.119
JOE, ISN'T THAT SOMETHING LEO
THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD BE DOING?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.854
YEAH, BUT HE GOT CALLED AWAY

10:20.888 --> 10:22.823
ON PERSONAL BUSINESS.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.292
AND HE TOOK HIS TOOLS AND
HIS SAWHORSES AND HIS GUYS?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.160
I GUESS, YEAH.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.998
SO WHAT IS THIS PERSONAL BUSINESS
THAT LEO GOT CALLED AWAY TO DO?

10:31.031 --> 10:33.200
I WOULD CATEGORIZE IT AS A...

10:33.233 --> 10:34.968
HISSY FIT.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.904
WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.972
WHAT DID I DO TO HIM? WHY DO YOU
ASSUME I DID SOMETHING TO HIM?

10:39.006 --> 10:41.809
WHY DON'T YOU ASSUME THAT LEO DID SOMETHING
TO ME... WHICH, BY THE WAY, HE DID.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.144
ALL RIGHT, I'M ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
WHAT DID LEO DO?

10:44.177 --> 10:46.980
HE TRIED TO CHARGE US 15% MORE FOR THE
COPPER, THAT'S WHAT HE TRIED TO DO.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.850
AND I SAID "NO WAY" AND,
YOU KNOW, AND SOME...

10:49.883 --> 10:53.220
WORDS WERE EXCHANGED AND HE
TOOK HIS STUFF AND HE LEFT.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.856
BBBB... GO BACK TO THE
"WORDS WERE EXCHANGED" PART

10:55.889 --> 10:58.058
AND BREAK THAT DOWN A
LITTLE BETTER FOR ME.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.260
- HE'S GONNA CLAIM THAT HE QUIT.
- HE QUIT?!

11:00.293 --> 11:01.962
NO! IT'S JUST POSTURING.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.964
YOU DON'T HAVE A
LOT OF EXPERIENCE

11:03.997 --> 11:06.934
- WITH THESE HIGH-LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS, DO YOU?
- UH, ONLY EVERY DAY.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.803
OH YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. THE
GAVEL STUFF, RIGHT YEAH.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.839
DON'T WORRY, HE'S
COMING BACK, OKAY?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.974
HOW DO YOU KNOW? WHAT
IF HE NEVER COMES BACK?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.976
I'M GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

11:16.009 --> 11:18.045
BATHING IN DRY TUBS
SURROUNDED BY CATS.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.881
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CATS.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.017
ONCE THEY FIND OUT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY WALLS, THEY'LL BE HERE!

11:24.051 --> 11:25.986
( chuckles ) WILL YOU RELAX?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.121
WHAT THESE GUYS DO IS NOT
ROCKET SCIENCE, OKAY?

11:28.155 --> 11:30.223
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE TODAY ALL
BY MYSELF? HUNG UP THREE CABINETS,

11:30.257 --> 11:32.960
TILED THE SHOWER UPSTAIRS AND I
STAINED ALL THE FLOORS UP THERE TOO.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.328
REALLY? YOU?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.865
YEAH. STOP GUSHING.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.733
BY THE WAY, THE FLOORS UP THERE?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.002
THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.005
DON'T ANYONE GO UPSTAIRS. THERE'S
LIKE THIS GLUE ALL OVER THE FLOOR

11:45.038 --> 11:47.340
AND IT WON'T LET
GO OF YOUR SHOES.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.943
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
IT'S WOOD STAIN, DUDE.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.412
IT DRIES IN JUST...

11:54.114 --> 11:56.183
72 HOURS.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.219
SO WE CAN'T GO UPSTAIRS
THE REST OF THE WEEK?

11:59.252 --> 12:02.055
THAT'S GREAT, JOE, BECAUSE I CAN
WEAR THIS SKIRT FOR THREE DAYS.

12:02.089 --> 12:06.093
IT'S DESIGNED TO GO FROM WORK TO SLEEP TO SLEEP
TO WORK TO WORK TO SLEEP, SLEEP TO WORK.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.962
UH, THE FLOORS UPSTAIRS
ARE ALL STICKY.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.933
YEAH, ISN'T IT AMAZING WHAT JOE'S BEEN
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN JUST ONE DAY?

12:28.982 --> 12:31.218
( door opens )

12:32.886 --> 12:35.422
IT'S ALL YOURS. PEE QUIETLY,
I'M TRYING NOT TO WAKE UP.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.524
YOU'VE GOT IT.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.032
JEEZ, LENNOX, GIMME
SOME OF THE BLANKET.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.069
( shrieks )

12:50.804 --> 12:54.041
- WHAT THE HELL?
- I TOUCHED PEC.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.010
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED,
BURKE, BESIDES FEELING ME UP?

12:57.044 --> 12:59.312
CRINGING. CAN SOMEONE
TURN ON A LIGHT?

12:59.346 --> 13:03.016
BURKE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN
THIS BED WITH ME? I NEED TO KNOW.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.252
LONG ENOUGH TO BE TRAUMATIZED...
ABOUT TWO SECONDS.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.387
YAY, EVERYBODY'S AWAKE.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.389
YEAH, HOW COULD ANYONE SLEEP?

13:09.422 --> 13:13.060
I WAS SLEEPING JUST FINE UNTIL
THE NIGHT GROPER CAME IN HERE.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.062
I MIGHT ACTUALLY NEED
A SUPPORT GROUP NOW.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.797
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO SLEEP IN A PARK

13:17.831 --> 13:20.233
- WHERE IT'S SAFER.
- OH, WILL YOU CALM DOWN?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.768
- PLEASE?
- I AM CALM.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.371
I AM VERY CALM FOR
SOMEONE WHOSE BEAUTIFUL

13:24.404 --> 13:26.539
HOME RENOVATION WAS
WRECKED IN ONE DAY BY

13:26.573 --> 13:31.244
"JOSEPH P. LONGO, CONSTRUCTION M..."
THESE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE!

13:31.278 --> 13:34.547
- CAN'T WE JUST GET LEO BACK?
- YEAH, JUST APOLOGIZE.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.783
YOU KNOW? TELL HIM
WE MADE A MISTAKE.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.419
- I'M GONNA CALL HIM IN THE MORNING.
- NO, YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.254
WE'LL LOSE EVERY
ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE.

13:41.288 --> 13:45.092
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF
ADVANTAGE DO WE HAVE?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.929
YEAH, WE'RE SLEEPING ON OLD AIR MATTRESSES
FROM THE GARAGE THAT SMELL LIKE SKUNK PEE.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.831
- OH, THAT'S WHAT THAT IS?
- OKAY, LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:51.865 --> 13:55.835
EVERYBODY JUST RELAX HERE. LOOK, WE ARE AT
A VERY CRITICAL POINT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.106
WE HAVE TO STAY UNIFIED. REMEMBER,
WE ALL HAVE A COMMON ENEMY.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.110
NOT ME... LEO!

14:10.250 --> 14:12.485
- JOE, ARE YOU SURE LEO'S GONNA SHOW UP?
- YES.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.121
JUST KEEP A LOOKOUT, ALL RIGHT?

14:14.154 --> 14:16.189
YOU KNOW WHAT, BURKE?
I HAVE TO TELL YOU...

14:16.223 --> 14:19.226
- AFTER A LOUSY NIGHT'S SLEEP, YOU DON'T LOOK HALF BAD.
- WHY, THANK YOU, JOE.

14:19.259 --> 14:23.030
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SAVING GRACE TO THIS
THING IS THAT I ACTUALLY GET TO USE

14:23.063 --> 14:26.433
MY EMERGENCY PANTIES I ALWAYS
CARRY AROUND IN MY PURSE.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.568
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
THEY'RE BRIGHT ORANGE.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.971
THIS WAY RESCUE
HELICOPTERS CAN FIND YOU.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.242
LENNOX, YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.577
WOW, THANK YOU, AUNT MEL,
BUT I'M IN CHARACTER.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.612
FOR THE PLAY? I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T DOING IT.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.448
OH NO, NOT ONLY ARE
WE STILL DOING IT,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.484
BUT I'M PLAYING THE LEAD. AND
THANKS TO A BAD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

14:44.517 --> 14:46.319
AND TOTAL LACK OF HAIR PRODUCTS,

14:46.353 --> 14:49.189
I'LL LOOK AS GROSS AS THAT
TYRANT PRINCIPAL LUNDT.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.259
- BUT SHE BANNED THE PLAY.
- ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.963
BUT COMMISSAR LUNDT DOES NOT CONTROL
THE PARK ACROSS THE STREET.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.165
WOW, I'M TORN!

14:58.198 --> 15:00.968
ON THE ONE HAND, I'M PROUD OF YOU
FOR FIGURING OUT THE WORK AROUND.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.503
AND ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN'T YOU HAVE A
LITTLE LESS INTEGRITY LIKE THE REST OF US?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.973
MM, AS APPEALING AS THAT IS,

15:06.006 --> 15:09.642
NO. IF I BACK DOWN NOW, I'LL BE
BACKING DOWN THE REST OF MY LIFE.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.179
- HEY, I THINK I SEE LEO'S TRUCK.
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU GUYS?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.081
HUH? I TOLD YOU HE'D
COME CRAWLING BACK.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.216
AND LIKE CLOCKWORK...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.351
( truck passing )

15:18.385 --> 15:20.520
THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRUCK.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.591
DON'T WORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SURE THE VERY NEXT TRUCK

15:24.624 --> 15:27.094
WILL ALSO NOT BE HIS.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.229
THERE'S PLENTY OF CHESS MOVES
LEFT IN THIS GAME, OKAY?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.965
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GONNA
GET SOME MORE WORK DONE

15:31.999 --> 15:34.901
AND WHEN LEO AND HIS GUYS GET BACK HERE,
THEY'LL JUST HAVE MORE CATCH UP, THAT'S ALL.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.703
( saw whirrs )

15:37.704 --> 15:41.274
- All: NO!
- WHAT? I BLEW A FUSE.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.243
YEAH, ME TOO! A LONG TIME AGO.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.113
IT'LL BE BACK ON IN 10 SECONDS.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.416
YOU'VE GOT TO FIX
THIS, ALL RIGHT?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.918
I CANNOT SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT
IN A ROOM WITH THAT GUY.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.387
DOESN'T ANYONE ELSE HEAR
HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP?

15:54.421 --> 15:57.024
"LADIES. LADIES, PLEASE.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.292
THERE'S ENOUGH JOE
TO GO AROUND."

16:00.393 --> 16:02.229
YEAH, YOU HAVE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING!

16:02.262 --> 16:04.164
OKAY, THE FRIGHT LOOK
IS GOOD FOR TODAY,

16:04.197 --> 16:07.067
BUT TOMORROW I NEED TO GO BACK
TO NATURAL, EFFORTLESS BEAUTY.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.601
AND THAT TAKES PRODUCT.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.304
GUYS, I CAN GET
THIS BACK ON TRACK.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.506
OKAY, I KNOW HOW TO DEAL
WITH BULLHEADED MEN.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.277
YOU JUST STAND UP TO THEM, YOU LOOK
THEM RIGHT IN THE EYES AND YOU SAY...

16:17.310 --> 16:19.479
WHO LIKES BANANA BREAD?

16:19.512 --> 16:23.350
DOES LEO? COME ON, I
BAKED IT JUST FOR YOU.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.717
OKAY, I BOUGHT IT JUST FOR YOU!

16:24.751 --> 16:27.587
COME ON, PLEASE, COME
BACK TO THE JOB, LEO.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.023
PLEASE! PLEASE PLEASE
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

16:30.057 --> 16:32.192
- PLEASE PLEASE!
- OH, MEL,

16:32.225 --> 16:34.394
I LIKE YOU A LOT, BUT
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.631
- AND COSTS ARE COSTS.
- WELL, LOOK WHAT IS UNDERNEATH THE BREAD.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.435
A CHECK... A CHECK WITH
SOME BANANA GREASE ON IT,

16:42.469 --> 16:45.572
BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THAT OUT?
BY CASHING IT.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.408
AND NOBODY HAS TO KNOW ABOUT
THIS EXCEPT YOU AND ME.

16:48.441 --> 16:52.712
UH, BUT NEXT TIME ORDER THE
COPPER BEFORE YOU START THE JOB.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.748
OKAY, BUT I STILL GOTTA
WORK WITH JOE, RIGHT?

16:55.782 --> 16:59.352
- NO, THERE IS NO JOE. FORGET JOE.
- HE'S LEAVING?

16:59.386 --> 17:02.655
NO, HE'S... HE'S INCREDIBLY
VALUABLE WITH THE KIDS

17:02.689 --> 17:06.393
AND OTHER AREAS OF MY LIFE AND I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE HIS AUTHORITY,

17:06.426 --> 17:08.428
BUT...

17:08.461 --> 17:11.098
BUT JUST NOD AT WHATEVER THE
HELL HE SAYS AND THEN CALL ME.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.033
HOW IS THAT NOT UNDERMINING
HIS AUTHORITY?

17:14.067 --> 17:16.436
IT IS NOT UNDERMINING.
IT IS JUST CREATING

17:16.469 --> 17:20.207
A SEPARATE SECRET LINE OF AUTHORITY
THAT LEADS FROM YOU TO ME.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.377
YOU GREW UP IN POLITICS.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.279
I DID.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.752
- HEY!
- HEY, CAN WE GO OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT?

17:32.785 --> 17:35.188
SURE. WAIT, ARE WE CELEBRATING?

17:35.222 --> 17:38.358
- DID THE PLAY GO WELL?
- NO, PRINCIPAL LUNDT GOT WORD ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING

17:38.391 --> 17:41.328
AND SHOWED UP. YEAH, SHE SAT RIGHT
IN FRONT FOR THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.231
- SO YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
- IF ONLY.

17:44.264 --> 17:48.335
SHE LOVED IT! SHE SAID IT HAD THE
PATHOS AND SCOPE OF A GREEK TRAGEDY.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.470
SHE WANTS ME TO ENTER IT IN
THE STATE DRAMA COMPETITION.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.472
I MADE HER PROUD
TO BE AN EDUCATOR.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.075
- UGHH!!
- HEY, WHOA, ISN'T IT GOOD THAT PEOPLE LIKED IT?

17:56.109 --> 17:59.212
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS MAKE A
STATEMENT ABOUT CENSORSHIP,

17:59.246 --> 18:02.382
ARTISTIC EXPRESSION AND
PISS THAT WOMAN OFF.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.284
OH, HONEY,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.586
SOMETIMES NO MATTER
HOW HARD YOU TRY,

18:06.619 --> 18:09.256
YOU CAN'T PISS EVERYBODY OFF.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.658
I TAKE THAT AS A CHALLENGE.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.261
NO... NO.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.466
( gasps ) LEO'S BACK! JOE, LOOK.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.502
- LEO'S BACK.
- YEAH, I KNOW, HE SHOWED UP A COUPLE HOURS AGO.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.337
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER
PREDICTED THAT?

18:24.371 --> 18:28.608
HEY, MEL, I GOT THE NEW FAUCETS OUT
IN MY TRUCK. I'LL SHOW THEM TO YOU.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.511
- OH, GREAT.
- THANK YOU, LEO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.582
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS AMAZING?
THAT 15% ON THE COPPER BID?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.517
YEAH, MAGICALLY GONE. POOF!

18:37.550 --> 18:40.487
WOW, THAT IS GREAT NEWS
AND TOTALLY UNEXPECTED.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.456
OH, IT WAS EXPECTED. MAYBE NOT BY
YOU, BUT I SURE SAW IT COMING.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.092
SEE, MEL, THIS IS HOW
NEGOTIATIONS WORK.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.128
GUYS LIKE THIS WORK YOU AND
WORK YOU AND WORK YOU.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.599
UNTIL YOU FINALLY PUSH BACK AND YOU
SAY, "THAT'S IT. THAT'S ENOUGH, STOP."

18:52.632 --> 18:54.534
YEAH, THEY WORK YOU, HUH?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.270
YEAH, SEE, YOU BELIEVE THAT IF
YOU CODDLE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT,

18:57.304 --> 19:00.407
HE'S GONNA JUMP THROUGH HOOPS FOR YOU. THE
WORLD DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, ALL RIGHT?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.810
SO IN THE FUTURE WHEN I SUGGEST SOMETHING
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT AT FIRST AGREE WITH,

19:03.843 --> 19:06.846
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, JUST MAYBE
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT...

19:06.879 --> 19:08.815
ALL RIGHT, JUST SHUT IT.
SHUT IT!

19:08.848 --> 19:12.252
THE ONLY REASON HE'S BACK IS
BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA MONEY.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.489
HE TOLD YOU THAT I PAID HIM.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.394
I CANNOT BELIEVE
HE WOULD DO THAT.

19:21.428 --> 19:24.397
- YOU PAID HIM?
- OF COURSE I DID, YEAH.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.366
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU...

19:26.399 --> 19:28.568
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU.
YOU PAID HIM TOO?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.204
- WHY DO YOU THINK HE SHOWED UP?
- BECAUSE OF THE 500 BUCKS I GAVE HIM.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.540
500? I GAVE HIM A
CHECK FOR $5,000.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.342
5,000...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.610
NO WONDER WHY HE'S BEEN
SMILING ALL AFTERNOON.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.547
WAIT, OKAY, WHAT TIME
WERE YOU AT HIS OFFICE?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.249
- LIKE 2:30.
- I WAS THERE AT LIKE 2:00.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.816
- OH, I JUST MISSED YOU.
- OH HEY.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.453
LOOK AT THAT. NEXT TIME WE SNEAK
AROUND BEHIND EACH OTHER'S BACKS

19:46.486 --> 19:48.621
- WE SHOULD CARPOOL.
- NEXT TIME WE SNEAK AROUND

19:48.655 --> 19:50.257
YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT TO ME
AND I'LL SAVE YOU MONEY.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.225
THE ONLY REASON HE
LIKED YOUR 500 BUCKS

19:52.259 --> 19:54.327
WAS BECAUSE HE ALREADY HAD
MY 5,000 IN HIS POCKET.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.497
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT... YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.469
OH, BY THE WAY, UM, YOU KNOW HOW IT
WAS GONNA TAKE LIKE MONTHS AND MONTHS

20:02.502 --> 20:04.371
TO GET THAT SIX-BURNER STOVE?

20:04.404 --> 20:07.574
THE APPLIANCE GUY CALLED TODAY AND SAID THEY
HAD A FOUR-BURNER WITH A GRIDDLE IN STOCK,

20:07.607 --> 20:09.609
- SO I ORDERED IT.
- JOE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE...

20:09.642 --> 20:12.279
- PANCAKES.
- OH, GOOD CALL.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.780
YEAH, I KNOW, IT WAS.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.848
YEAH, THANK YOU, JOE.
THAT'S SMART.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.618
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THAT.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.720
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.222
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I APPRECIATE YOU

20:23.256 --> 20:25.792
GOING OVER THERE AND STRAIGHTENING
EVERYTHING OUT WITH LEO.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.194
YOU KNOW, WELL, WITH US.
WITH EVERYTHING REALLY.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.763
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO AFTER PUTTING
EVERYONE THROUGH THIS RENOVATION.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.699
- MOSTLY YOU.
- YEAH.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.607
- THIS FEELS REALLY WEIRD.
- YEAH, I FEEL IT TOO.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.909
- WHAT IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW,

20:42.942 --> 20:46.546
I THINK IT'S SOME STRANGE
MUTUAL APPRECIATION THING.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.550
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.522
I DON'T LIKE IT. I'M
GONNA GET SOME AIR.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.467
( groans )

21:08.901 --> 21:12.305
"FIRST PLACE, OHIO REGIONAL DRAMA
COMPETITION LENNOX SCANLON."

21:12.339 --> 21:15.475
THE PRINCIPAL MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
ABOUT IT TODAY AT THE ASSEMBLY.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.944
SHE CALLED LENNOX UP AND...

21:17.977 --> 21:20.580
HUGGED HER IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.482
POOR GIRL. ALL SHE WANTED TO DO

21:22.515 --> 21:24.917
WAS TORMENT HER PRINCIPAL
AND CREATE TROUBLE.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.619
I LOVE HER FOR JUST TRYING.
