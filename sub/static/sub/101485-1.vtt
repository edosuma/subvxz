00:18.525 --> 00:19.726
Good evening.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.026
We're interrupting your
programming tonight

00:21.028 --> 00:22.929
to report to you
live from city hall

00:22.931 --> 00:25.063
in the disappearance
of Chief Braddock,

00:25.065 --> 00:26.331
who we are just being told

00:26.333 --> 00:29.103
has now been missing
for 17 hours.

00:30.538 --> 00:31.970
It has
not been confirmed,

00:31.972 --> 00:34.406
but a source inside
reported another live feed

00:34.408 --> 00:36.808
was just posted
privately for the police.

00:36.810 --> 00:39.711
The Checkmate killer has not
yet claimed responsibility,

00:39.713 --> 00:41.314
but we have reason to
believe he may have

00:41.316 --> 00:43.815
taken his highest
profile target yet.

00:43.817 --> 00:46.552
Every officer in
the city, along with the FBI,

00:46.554 --> 00:48.854
is working tirelessly
to find him.

00:48.856 --> 00:51.056
However at this
time we have no word

00:51.058 --> 00:52.724
on the chief's whereabouts.

01:35.102 --> 01:37.104
Hi, Chief.

01:38.006 --> 01:39.738
You're a dead man.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.356
The checkmate killer?

01:57.358 --> 01:59.624
He's nothing but a
repulsive coward.

01:59.626 --> 02:01.994
He should come out and
meet me like a man.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.500
We're gonna hang you
for this, fucker.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.602
Yeah.

02:09.604 --> 02:12.171
Well not just for this.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.940
Who do you work for?

02:25.486 --> 02:26.320
Fuck you.

02:27.354 --> 02:28.188
Ah.

02:29.356 --> 02:32.558
White
knight takes black king.

04:17.098 --> 04:18.600
I don't work for him.

04:19.567 --> 04:20.666
It's not for him.

04:20.668 --> 04:21.968
It's for me.

04:26.908 --> 04:29.944
I need a permanent solution,
but it can't get back to me.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.314
It's gone in two days.

04:35.216 --> 04:36.449
I didn't wanna ask this of ya,

04:36.451 --> 04:39.151
but I need someone
with your abilities

04:39.153 --> 04:40.555
to rattle their bones.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.957
20% is yours when
the job is complete.

04:45.959 --> 04:49.661
Plus double your usual signing
bonus, which is in there.

04:54.735 --> 04:57.435
I'll be needing access
to your inside people.

04:57.437 --> 04:58.471
It's in there.

04:58.473 --> 05:00.740
Complete list of contacts.

05:00.742 --> 05:03.942
I'll make sure they know to
expect your instructions.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.757
Yes.

05:51.759 --> 05:53.558
Of course I understand.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.029
I just want it out of
my hands in 24 hours.

05:59.434 --> 06:00.233
Good.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.834
Thank you.

06:01.836 --> 06:02.969
Ah.

06:02.971 --> 06:03.803
You okay?

06:03.805 --> 06:05.503
Yeah, just some crap.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.206
I've been trying to get
those confiscated funds

06:07.208 --> 06:08.740
back to the FBI for months now,

06:08.742 --> 06:10.875
and some asshole
bureaucrat keeps middling.

06:10.877 --> 06:11.810
What are you gonna do?

06:11.812 --> 06:12.678
Same shit, different day.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.514
Have a seat.

06:14.514 --> 06:15.349
What's up?

06:16.550 --> 06:18.884
We found another young
girl in zone four today.

06:18.886 --> 06:20.620
Bullet to the head.

06:20.622 --> 06:21.654
We managed to keep
it from the press,

06:21.656 --> 06:23.322
but there was another note.

06:23.324 --> 06:25.324
It read white knight
takes pawn six.

06:25.326 --> 06:26.825
Mind your path.

06:26.827 --> 06:28.594
The lab rats think
it's a copycat,

06:28.596 --> 06:30.997
but we haven't seen a reference

06:30.999 --> 06:33.765
to the white knight
since Braddock's murder.

06:33.767 --> 06:36.002
Well, didn't we find
another note two days ago?

06:36.004 --> 06:37.502
Yes, sir.

06:37.504 --> 06:39.238
Male's victim's body we
found on the north shore.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.272
Jeff Walters.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.507
Another bullet to the head.

06:41.509 --> 06:43.276
Another reference to
the white knights.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.476
A white knight takes...

06:44.478 --> 06:45.911
A white knight
takes King's Bishop.

06:45.913 --> 06:47.413
Thank you, yes.

06:47.415 --> 06:48.913
The handwriting
doesn't even match

06:48.915 --> 06:51.252
any prior samples we have
of Checkmate's handwriting.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.987
What do you think, Markou?

06:55.523 --> 06:56.956
I don't know.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.659
The notes could be in
connection to those murders.

06:59.661 --> 07:01.896
Could also just a
connection with those girls.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.466
Walsh?

07:07.468 --> 07:09.567
Both the girls had
a mark, some stamp.

07:09.569 --> 07:10.671
Nothing permit though.

07:12.105 --> 07:13.706
We'll figure it out.

07:13.708 --> 07:15.908
Use whatever resources you need.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.411
I'm meeting with the
mayor here in a few hours.

07:18.413 --> 07:19.881
Where the hell is my phone?

07:20.848 --> 07:21.682
Ugh.

07:23.050 --> 07:25.651
I'll take the lead on
Walters and the notes.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.452
Sounds good.

07:26.454 --> 07:27.288
I'll take the girls.

07:28.255 --> 07:29.421
Good.

07:29.423 --> 07:31.022
If the mayor approves
this taskforce,

07:31.024 --> 07:33.259
we're gonna be
partnering with the FBI.

07:33.261 --> 07:36.695
They'll have high level, but
we get to make our own calls.

07:36.697 --> 07:37.531
Okay.

07:38.865 --> 07:40.534
What do you think
of this picture?

07:41.968 --> 07:43.236
You make a pretty lady.

07:45.038 --> 07:47.974
I think it's handsome,
but get to work.

07:50.411 --> 07:51.245
Thank you.

07:52.747 --> 07:53.948
Are you kidding me?

07:54.848 --> 07:56.248
Where's my charger?

08:05.526 --> 08:06.625
Pardon me.

08:30.651 --> 08:32.083
Been here since you, sir?

08:32.086 --> 08:34.785
Yeah, it's the
Chief's daughter Katie Masters.

08:34.788 --> 08:35.621
Okay.

08:37.057 --> 08:37.890
I know.

08:44.298 --> 08:45.564
Coffee?

08:45.566 --> 08:46.401
Yeah.

08:48.101 --> 08:49.535
Coffee.

08:49.537 --> 08:50.370
Yeah what?

08:51.538 --> 08:52.772
No, would you
like some coffee?

08:52.774 --> 08:53.906
Oh God.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.074
I'm sorry.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.007
Oh yeah.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.743
Sorry, I thought you said Katie.

08:57.745 --> 08:58.812
I got that.

09:01.849 --> 09:03.348
Lieutenant Markou.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.816
Katie Masters.

09:04.818 --> 09:05.618
Nice to meet you.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.453
I know.

09:07.522 --> 09:08.589
So what do you think?

09:12.326 --> 09:13.326
What do you think?

09:17.798 --> 09:19.699
I think this was a statement.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.169
Someone saying back off.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.011
Nice meeting you, Katie.

09:32.013 --> 09:33.579
Let me know if you see anything.

09:46.326 --> 09:47.662
It's time, sir.

09:50.230 --> 09:51.664
You realize what
you're asking.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.864
Yeah, I know Jack, but listen,

09:52.866 --> 09:53.799
we've been pushing
our commitment

09:53.801 --> 09:55.903
to this cause hard and publicly.

09:57.337 --> 09:58.405
We shook the tree.

09:59.874 --> 10:02.208
The girl this morning is the
second in less than a week.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.575
Now are we gonna
let this continue

10:03.577 --> 10:05.712
or are we gonna take
charge and say no?

10:08.349 --> 10:10.916
You saw what happened
to Chief Braddock.

10:10.918 --> 10:13.587
Checkmate had nothing to
do with human trafficking.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.790
Jack, we have to do this.

10:23.264 --> 10:24.499
Okay, let's go with it.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.367
Thank you, sir.

10:28.302 --> 10:29.468
Thanks Jack.

10:38.913 --> 10:39.978
How's it going?

10:39.980 --> 10:40.780
Oh, good.

10:42.048 --> 10:45.586
Hey, so this symbol, do
you know what it means?

10:46.953 --> 10:48.253
I think it's like a calling card

10:48.255 --> 10:50.155
like a mark you can wash off.

10:50.157 --> 10:51.757
You know, if Maradona.

10:51.759 --> 10:52.557
What?

10:55.696 --> 10:56.962
What are you doing?

10:56.964 --> 10:57.765
I'm sorry.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.766
You were about to
ask about Maradona.

11:00.768 --> 11:01.767
Yeah.

11:04.105 --> 11:04.938
Okay.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.473
I'll help you.

11:07.475 --> 11:08.609
Just please be careful.

11:09.876 --> 11:11.209
I can take care of myself.

11:11.211 --> 11:12.111
I'm the chief's daughter.

11:12.113 --> 11:13.579
Not my first rodeo.

11:13.581 --> 11:15.347
It's not to scare you.

11:15.349 --> 11:16.384
I'm just looking out.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.884
I appreciate that, but
I'm just a photographer.

11:19.886 --> 11:22.588
We both know you're
much more than that.

11:22.590 --> 11:26.090
Look, for what it's worth like
I said I'm going to help you,

11:26.092 --> 11:28.762
but please just be smart.

11:30.331 --> 11:32.033
You never know
who's watching you.

11:32.899 --> 11:34.098
I will.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.676
Nick Cueno.

12:18.678 --> 12:19.578
Hey, it's Katie.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.411
Hey Katie.

12:20.413 --> 12:21.479
How was the stop?

12:21.481 --> 12:22.881
Interesting.

12:22.883 --> 12:24.882
The girl had a fresh
mark on her arm.

12:24.884 --> 12:27.822
The same mark as from the
girl from a few days ago.

12:29.690 --> 12:31.556
You saying she was targeted.

12:31.558 --> 12:32.459
I'm not sure.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.762
I talked to an officer
and he said her murder

12:36.764 --> 12:38.998
could have been a statement
that it could have been

12:39.000 --> 12:41.199
telling the police to back off.

12:41.201 --> 12:44.737
And then he cautioned me
about digging into Maradona.

12:44.739 --> 12:46.805
Well, we can't
assume it's Maradona.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.872
True, but who
else could it be?

12:49.874 --> 12:50.010
What else did he say?

12:51.144 --> 12:52.645
He said that I
shouldn't trust anyone

12:52.647 --> 12:54.579
and that I need to
stop digging into this.

12:54.581 --> 12:55.414
I don't know.

12:55.416 --> 12:56.217
He was kinda encrypted.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.384
Katie, you know, this
means he has police

12:59.386 --> 13:00.720
or others on his side, right?

13:01.721 --> 13:02.554
Yeah, I get it.

13:02.556 --> 13:03.391
I know.

13:04.258 --> 13:06.090
Can you meet me at WingHarts?

13:06.092 --> 13:07.559
The cop bar?

13:07.561 --> 13:09.361
We've gotta
start somewhere.

13:09.363 --> 13:10.429
Okay.

13:10.431 --> 13:11.729
Okay.

13:11.731 --> 13:12.565
Give me like 30.

13:16.437 --> 13:17.268
Okay.

13:35.889 --> 13:37.823
Daddy, where are you?

14:36.750 --> 14:37.983
Oh God.

14:37.985 --> 14:38.650
Oh
hey, sorry Katie.

14:38.652 --> 14:39.852
You okay?

14:39.854 --> 14:40.685
- Yeah, yeah.
- Take your time.

14:40.687 --> 14:41.820
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:41.822 --> 14:42.655
Thanks.

14:51.164 --> 14:53.531
Knows who he is
but the Maradona

14:53.533 --> 14:56.901
has been associated with
this sketch provided

14:56.903 --> 15:00.138
by the only eyewitness
to come forward.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.640
A man resembling this sketch

15:01.642 --> 15:04.845
is allegedly in charge of
trafficking operations.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.814
If you recognize this
sketch or have seen,

15:08.816 --> 15:11.083
just call the number.

15:11.085 --> 15:11.916
Here you go.

15:11.918 --> 15:13.352
Thanks.

15:50.524 --> 15:52.456
On the north shore we
have confirmed the identity

15:52.458 --> 15:56.328
of the body that washed ashore
last night as Jeff Walters.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.263
He also died of a gunshot
wound to the head.

15:59.265 --> 16:01.300
Police are not yet
willing to confirm

16:01.302 --> 16:03.835
whether or not these
murders are connected.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.337
Yeah, I was
running through here

16:05.339 --> 16:07.942
like I do every morning and
I looked up at the point.

16:09.275 --> 16:10.608
There he was.

16:10.610 --> 16:11.810
Whoa.

16:11.812 --> 16:13.581
Ran into a movie
scene or something.

16:14.715 --> 16:15.881
Gotta go.

16:15.883 --> 16:17.181
Can you give me the check?

16:17.183 --> 16:18.850
Oh, it's okay.

16:18.852 --> 16:19.686
Thanks.

16:20.888 --> 16:22.353
A tall, white male

16:22.355 --> 16:25.158
approximately five foot eight
in a tee shirt and boots.

16:53.553 --> 16:54.386
No.

16:58.692 --> 16:59.523
Go, go, go.

17:14.807 --> 17:15.806
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:15.808 --> 17:16.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:16.742 --> 17:18.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:18.178 --> 17:19.111
- Calm down, calm down.
- Help us, help us, help us.

17:19.113 --> 17:20.045
What's wrong?

17:20.047 --> 17:20.711
Help us, please.

17:20.713 --> 17:21.380
What's wrong?

18:01.521 --> 18:02.355
Yeah.

18:03.324 --> 18:04.525
North shore somewhere.

18:05.425 --> 18:06.658
Copy that.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.427
Dre and Davis are closest.

18:08.429 --> 18:11.129
Rich is in the
Mexican war district.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.998
Send them all now.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.232
Understood.

18:30.817 --> 18:32.484
Two dead men positioned
on Federal and Isabella.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.552
Roger that.

18:33.554 --> 18:34.353
Prospect sighting up north.

18:34.355 --> 18:35.286
Roger.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.287
They ran down there, hurry.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.122
Where, where?

18:37.124 --> 18:37.958
Down there.

18:45.265 --> 18:47.298
This is 3612 daylight.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.165
Officer down.

18:48.167 --> 18:49.534
Shots fired.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.705
Suspect heading northeast
stop 28 on foot.

18:53.007 --> 18:53.971
He has a gun.

18:54.807 --> 18:56.173
Please stop.

18:56.175 --> 18:57.174
You okay?

18:57.176 --> 18:58.009
No.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.583
Katie.

19:04.585 --> 19:05.917
You okay?

19:05.919 --> 19:06.852
No, no.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.888
Someone just tried to kidnap me.

19:09.355 --> 19:10.188
Wasn't me.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.023
No, back there.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.224
Okay, come with me.

19:12.226 --> 19:13.592
I'll get both of
you to the station.

19:13.594 --> 19:14.992
Your dad is there.

19:14.994 --> 19:15.828
Wait.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.033
What precinct are you with?

19:20.366 --> 19:21.232
What?

19:21.234 --> 19:22.234
What precinct?

19:22.236 --> 19:23.267
One.

19:23.269 --> 19:24.236
Look, let's talk in the car.

19:24.238 --> 19:25.471
We're not safe here.

19:26.539 --> 19:27.372
No.

19:39.987 --> 19:40.821
Thanks.

19:42.689 --> 19:43.921
How'd you know?

19:43.923 --> 19:46.757
He didn't call it in
and he knew my name.

19:46.759 --> 19:48.595
The other officers
back there didn't.

19:50.497 --> 19:51.997
107112.

19:51.999 --> 19:54.766
Last sighting heading north
towards 10 Street bridge.

19:54.768 --> 19:55.669
What are you doing?

19:57.237 --> 19:58.603
Something else.

20:00.707 --> 20:03.210
187 1053 heading down on 12th.

20:05.311 --> 20:06.344
10 four.

20:06.346 --> 20:07.181
1045.

20:08.048 --> 20:09.083
What are you doing?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.017
He's a real cop.

20:12.019 --> 20:13.317
Some gunshot
wounds on the side.

20:13.319 --> 20:15.554
A man with a woman
shot the officers

20:15.556 --> 20:17.756
and ran down the pier
dragging the woman.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.490
They just said
you killed cops.

20:19.492 --> 20:20.892
Why are they saying that?

20:20.894 --> 20:22.059
I don't know.

20:22.061 --> 20:23.027
Why are cops trying
to kidnap you?

20:23.029 --> 20:24.528
I don't know.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.297
My father, he's Chief Masters.

20:26.299 --> 20:30.000
I've been trying to call him
all day and he's not answering.

20:30.002 --> 20:32.069
And there's this
cop this afternoon.

20:32.071 --> 20:34.005
He came up to me
and he was trying.

20:34.007 --> 20:35.306
No, don't do that.

20:35.308 --> 20:36.941
Whoever it is will
find out where we are.

20:36.943 --> 20:38.809
It's exactly what they want.

20:38.811 --> 20:39.777
Hop in.

20:39.779 --> 20:40.711
No, these cars are low jacked.

20:40.713 --> 20:41.680
We can't do that.

20:41.682 --> 20:44.615
We gotta find another way.

20:44.617 --> 20:46.985
Are you surprised?

20:46.987 --> 20:48.021
What are you doing?

20:50.022 --> 20:51.655
I asked you a question.

20:54.661 --> 20:55.929
Ditch your phone.

20:57.498 --> 20:58.529
Shit.

21:07.540 --> 21:09.141
For those
of you just joining us,

21:09.143 --> 21:12.776
we have reports of an
attempted kidnapping.

21:21.788 --> 21:23.622
Followed her out of the bar.

21:23.624 --> 21:25.390
Stopped on the corner
and then sprint

21:25.392 --> 21:27.191
in the same direction she went.

21:27.193 --> 21:28.692
I was standing here.

21:28.694 --> 21:29.730
He was over there.

21:30.931 --> 21:32.264
Pale, red hair.

21:32.266 --> 21:33.767
It was on take off.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.867
Then I heard a girl scream.

21:36.869 --> 21:39.671
Then I heard gunshots, then
I went back in the bar.

21:56.623 --> 21:57.591
Catherine.

22:13.874 --> 22:14.708
Catherine.

22:17.277 --> 22:18.077
Pittsburgh P.D.

22:18.979 --> 22:20.047
It's Officer Langdon.

22:36.762 --> 22:38.095
Yes, sir.

22:38.097 --> 22:39.396
Are you still at her place?

22:39.398 --> 22:41.434
Yeah, nothing here.

22:42.803 --> 22:43.701
They got away.

22:43.703 --> 22:44.702
Stay there.

22:44.704 --> 22:45.536
Understood.

22:45.538 --> 22:46.638
And if they show?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.139
Don't engage.

22:48.141 --> 22:49.607
Hide if you have to.

22:49.609 --> 22:50.574
What the hell?

22:50.576 --> 22:51.875
There's no place to hide.

22:51.877 --> 22:53.112
There's always a place.

22:55.382 --> 22:57.114
Where wouldn't you look?

22:57.116 --> 22:58.816
Yeah.

22:58.818 --> 23:00.785
This is not going to work.

23:00.787 --> 23:02.019
Just do it.

23:02.021 --> 23:03.455
It's
a tiny apartment.

23:03.457 --> 23:04.288
I don't care.

23:04.290 --> 23:05.422
Figure something out.

23:05.424 --> 23:06.857
Okay.

23:06.859 --> 23:08.026
And send me the address.

23:08.028 --> 23:08.892
Yes, sir.

23:08.894 --> 23:10.327
I'll be there soon.

23:38.724 --> 23:40.859
Sorry.

23:40.861 --> 23:42.427
We have to get to
the police somehow.

23:42.429 --> 23:43.661
Why?

23:43.663 --> 23:45.796
So they can try
and kill us again?

23:45.798 --> 23:46.797
I know officers.

23:46.799 --> 23:47.798
They could help.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.732
You heard them.

23:48.734 --> 23:50.102
They think we're cop killers.

23:53.707 --> 23:55.073
I'm sorry.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.740
I'm sorry.

23:56.742 --> 23:58.543
What happened?

23:58.545 --> 24:01.078
I really don't know.

24:01.080 --> 24:01.946
I was.

24:01.948 --> 24:02.881
There was this officer.

24:02.883 --> 24:04.082
I was at this crime scene.

24:04.084 --> 24:05.984
I'm a photographer
for the paper in town

24:05.986 --> 24:09.254
and I was trying to call my
dad and he wouldn't answer.

24:09.256 --> 24:11.323
And then my boss was
supposed to pick me up.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.690
And I don't know.

24:12.692 --> 24:14.292
You think
photographs caused this?

24:14.294 --> 24:15.295
I don't know.

24:16.395 --> 24:19.396
There was this detective
and he warned me

24:19.398 --> 24:21.099
about asking questions
about Maradona.

24:21.101 --> 24:22.700
He practically threatened me.

24:22.702 --> 24:24.335
Who?

24:24.337 --> 24:25.305
Gioffre Markou.

24:26.873 --> 24:28.672
No, no, he's a good guy.

24:28.674 --> 24:29.507
I don't know.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.441
I'll vouch.

24:30.443 --> 24:31.176
He's one of my best friends.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.177
He's clean.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.678
No.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.412
Well maybe he was
just trying to help.

24:35.414 --> 24:37.614
Maybe it was the pictures.

24:37.616 --> 24:38.818
Maybe it was your dad.

24:40.921 --> 24:41.753
My camera.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.254
My camera.

24:43.256 --> 24:44.088
I automatically downloads
everything to my laptop.

24:44.090 --> 24:45.590
We can go get it.

24:45.592 --> 24:47.292
It's like 10 blocks away
from here at my apartment.

24:47.294 --> 24:48.293
We could go get the...

24:48.295 --> 24:49.794
No, no.

24:49.796 --> 24:50.728
You know that's the first
place they'll look for you.

24:50.730 --> 24:51.962
It's all we have.

24:51.964 --> 24:54.298
That's the dumbest
thing we could do.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.400
No, no.

24:55.402 --> 24:56.234
Ugh.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.405
Son of a bitch.

25:13.787 --> 25:15.053
10 four.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.654
2357 daylight, please
use the proper codes.

25:17.656 --> 25:19.457
10 four, dispatch.

25:19.459 --> 25:20.525
10 four.

25:20.527 --> 25:21.359
1158.

25:21.361 --> 25:22.496
I repeat, 1158.

25:24.263 --> 25:25.229
10 four.

25:56.496 --> 25:57.364
Yeah.

25:58.230 --> 25:59.566
One of your guys is down.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.535
Witnesses saw a guy
and a girl shoot.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.075
Cherry.

26:10.844 --> 26:12.209
Understood.

26:24.156 --> 26:26.257
Hey, hey.

26:26.259 --> 26:27.525
Let go of me.

26:27.527 --> 26:28.826
Let go of me.

26:28.828 --> 26:29.663
Stop it.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.030
Why are you following me?

26:33.032 --> 26:35.834
A cop just tried to kill us.

26:35.836 --> 26:37.503
Why are cops trying to kill us?

26:39.538 --> 26:41.506
Thank you for saving me,
but I'm going up there.

26:41.508 --> 26:43.742
You can do whatever you want.

26:59.925 --> 27:00.691
What?

27:00.693 --> 27:01.526
What's wrong?

27:01.528 --> 27:02.362
This is my floor.

27:04.263 --> 27:05.630
How was I supposed
to know that?

27:08.234 --> 27:09.034
What?

27:10.202 --> 27:11.704
You really want
me to go first?

27:34.627 --> 27:35.727
Wait, wait, wait.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.865
We should go.

27:41.867 --> 27:42.967
We should go now.

27:42.969 --> 27:43.803
Why?

27:48.407 --> 27:49.241
What?

27:50.809 --> 27:52.142
What?

27:52.144 --> 27:53.878
Wait, you live like this?

27:53.880 --> 27:54.881
Oh my God.

28:51.738 --> 28:53.173
I'm Kyle by the way.

28:55.075 --> 28:55.974
Katie.

28:55.976 --> 28:56.810
I know.

28:57.676 --> 29:00.143
Wait, I know you.

29:00.145 --> 29:02.115
You're Chief Braddock's
son, aren't you?

29:06.086 --> 29:06.920
Whoa.

29:12.392 --> 29:13.257
What?

29:13.259 --> 29:15.325
- What's wrong?
- Sh.

29:15.327 --> 29:16.628
Don't shush me.

29:31.877 --> 29:32.945
Are you okay?

29:36.415 --> 29:37.914
Is he dead?

29:37.916 --> 29:39.449
He's.

29:39.451 --> 29:40.884
Okay.

29:40.886 --> 29:41.885
Oh my God.

29:51.765 --> 29:53.698
All right, all right.

29:53.700 --> 29:54.632
Let's go.

29:54.634 --> 29:55.799
Oh shit.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.843
Kou.

30:06.613 --> 30:08.446
Footage from the
bar is uploading now.

30:08.448 --> 30:09.913
We just received a 911 call.

30:09.915 --> 30:12.583
Shots fired at Katie
Masters apartment complex.

30:12.585 --> 30:14.485
Colts and Brady are
first on the scene.

30:14.487 --> 30:15.652
Where you been?

30:15.654 --> 30:17.988
I just came from the Chief's.

30:17.990 --> 30:18.791
He's not good.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.394
Pittsburgh P.D.

30:57.396 --> 30:58.362
Hand's up.

30:58.364 --> 30:59.197
I'm Katie Masters.

30:59.199 --> 31:00.230
Against the wall now.

31:00.232 --> 31:01.231
Against the wall.

31:01.233 --> 31:02.432
I'm the chief's daughter.

31:02.434 --> 31:03.269
Quiet.

31:10.009 --> 31:11.374
He didn't identify himself.

31:11.376 --> 31:12.211
Quiet.

31:13.813 --> 31:15.813
Dispatch, this
is Officer Saul.

31:15.815 --> 31:17.882
We have a possible homicide.

31:17.884 --> 31:19.851
300 Hind Street.

31:19.853 --> 31:21.354
I shot him in self defense.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.055
Who is there with him?

31:28.394 --> 31:29.293
Oh shit.

31:33.232 --> 31:34.399
Sir, we lost contact.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.433
What's going on?

31:36.435 --> 31:38.001
What happened?

31:38.003 --> 31:39.170
Let me know what's
in that footage.

32:36.962 --> 32:38.261
Wait.

32:38.263 --> 32:39.095
What?

32:39.097 --> 32:40.064
Why are we stopping?

32:40.066 --> 32:41.498
- Hang on.
- What?

33:43.563 --> 33:44.397
No.

33:45.230 --> 33:46.063
No.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.398
Please no, no.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.798
No, no.

34:25.070 --> 34:26.639
They know it's Katie Masters.

34:28.074 --> 34:29.974
Do they know
who's helping her?

34:29.976 --> 34:32.311
No, they think he
actually helped kidnap her.

34:38.150 --> 34:39.085
Change in plans.

34:40.253 --> 34:41.885
Don't kill him.

34:41.887 --> 34:42.822
Find out who he is.

34:51.563 --> 34:52.397
You okay?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.135
Who is that guy back there?

34:58.438 --> 34:59.271
I don't know.

35:06.144 --> 35:07.778
I recognized the older guy.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.682
I don't know his name,
but I know he's a cop.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.057
All right, let's go.

35:31.570 --> 35:34.771
Can we clear the
crime scene, please?

35:34.773 --> 35:36.141
Cassie and Murphy only.

35:51.090 --> 35:52.722
Found this.

35:52.724 --> 35:54.592
White knight takes black queen.

35:54.594 --> 35:55.427
Check.

35:56.728 --> 35:57.562
What?

35:59.197 --> 36:01.831
You know your hovering
isn't going to help.

36:01.833 --> 36:02.900
I'm thinking.

36:02.902 --> 36:04.137
Think somewhere else.

36:10.076 --> 36:10.943
Jesus.

36:12.311 --> 36:14.280
Kou says that she's
with Kyle Braddock.

36:16.081 --> 36:17.048
No way.

36:17.050 --> 36:17.884
No.

36:18.918 --> 36:20.053
I don't know, Cassie.

36:22.155 --> 36:23.787
Call dickhead.

36:23.789 --> 36:24.621
Calling dickhead.

36:27.226 --> 36:28.425
I mean, seriously.

36:28.427 --> 36:30.695
He kidnaps the girl and
then kills six cops.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.399
That's Kyle's phone.

36:34.867 --> 36:35.902
Did Katie know him?

36:37.170 --> 36:38.635
He.

36:38.637 --> 36:40.405
You know that doesn't
really prove Kyle did it.

36:43.376 --> 36:45.543
Why would they
come back to this apartment?

36:45.545 --> 36:46.476
I don't know.

36:46.478 --> 36:48.747
She escaped and came home.

36:49.614 --> 36:50.817
No, that doesn't work.

36:57.956 --> 36:58.856
Forensic specialist.

36:58.858 --> 36:59.859
Don't even say it.

37:38.097 --> 37:39.896
Eyes on
16th Street Bridge.

38:09.594 --> 38:11.128
Who are you?

38:11.130 --> 38:11.963
I got you.

38:13.699 --> 38:14.534
I got you.

38:17.103 --> 38:18.003
A little closer.

38:23.775 --> 38:24.609
There you are.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.016
Walsh.

38:32.117 --> 38:33.318
I got something for you.

38:45.498 --> 38:49.066
Did Kyle really
kidnap my daughter?

38:49.068 --> 38:50.069
You heard already?

38:53.806 --> 38:55.005
Sir, who would want to do this?

38:55.007 --> 38:56.673
Who wouldn't?

38:56.675 --> 38:58.708
What if it is just Kyle?

38:58.710 --> 39:01.845
He hasn't been right in the
head since his father's death.

39:01.847 --> 39:02.682
Nah.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.988
I gotta get this.

39:11.990 --> 39:12.956
Hey.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.159
Have you seen the guy?

39:19.599 --> 39:20.697
Hello?

39:20.699 --> 39:21.599
No.

39:21.601 --> 39:22.432
No.

39:22.434 --> 39:23.266
Who is he?

39:23.268 --> 39:24.200
I don't know.

39:24.202 --> 39:25.070
That's why I'm asking you.

39:25.938 --> 39:27.137
He's the driver of the car.

39:27.139 --> 39:28.938
He could be the ringleader.

39:28.940 --> 39:30.643
Car's registered to Nick Cueno.

39:32.143 --> 39:32.943
It's Katie's boss.

39:32.945 --> 39:34.577
He's missing.

39:34.579 --> 39:36.847
Okay, keep digging.

39:36.849 --> 39:37.650
If I must.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.262
Do you know this man?

39:52.264 --> 39:53.597
No, who is he?

39:53.599 --> 39:54.600
We don't know yet.

39:55.668 --> 39:56.669
FBI is on their way.

39:58.737 --> 40:00.538
We think he could
work for Maradona.

40:01.773 --> 40:02.972
No, no, no, no,
no, he wouldn't.

40:02.974 --> 40:04.074
She was last seen this morning

40:04.076 --> 40:05.876
photographing the crime scene

40:05.878 --> 40:07.280
and now her boss is missing.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.613
What better way to
get back at the man

40:10.615 --> 40:12.215
who's leading charge
against sex trafficking

40:12.217 --> 40:13.618
then to kidnap his daughter.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.188
Tom.

40:18.190 --> 40:19.492
Six cops are dead.

40:20.358 --> 40:22.458
I want my daughter back.

40:22.460 --> 40:23.828
You do what you have to do.

40:24.664 --> 40:26.165
I'll handle the FBI.

40:27.099 --> 40:28.234
I'll sort it out later.

40:38.978 --> 40:39.809
Wait, wait.

40:39.811 --> 40:41.278
Just hold on.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.515
No one's following us.

40:45.318 --> 40:46.118
I'm sorry.

40:48.186 --> 40:49.219
The bag.

40:49.221 --> 40:50.056
Where's the bag?

40:51.990 --> 40:53.222
You were supposed to grab it.

40:53.224 --> 40:54.525
I was supposed to grab it?

40:54.527 --> 40:55.492
Yeah, you're the
last one in there.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.061
You had it in your hand.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.662
The only reason we went up
there was for that laptop

40:58.664 --> 40:59.929
and you left it up there.

40:59.931 --> 41:01.731
Just stop yelling
at me for one second.

41:01.733 --> 41:02.666
Let me just think.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.168
Pictures.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.470
There was a mark
on this girl's arm

41:06.472 --> 41:08.871
and it was like it
was in a circle.

41:08.873 --> 41:11.275
It was waves in a
circle on her wrist.

41:11.277 --> 41:12.642
Like.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.545
Like three?

41:14.612 --> 41:15.813
- Like three marks?
- Yeah.

41:15.815 --> 41:16.646
Yeah.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.182
How did you know that?

41:18.184 --> 41:19.749
Do I really have to regain
your trust every 15 minutes?

41:19.751 --> 41:20.684
I'm sorry.

41:20.686 --> 41:21.418
I have no idea what's going on.

41:22.987 --> 41:23.822
Oh shit.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.236
Answer that when
I call or she dies.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.280
Why are you trying to hurt me?

41:50.282 --> 41:52.349
No, what are you doing?

41:52.351 --> 41:54.751
Why, why do you wanna hurt me?

42:06.898 --> 42:08.000
Did I stutter?

42:09.335 --> 42:11.267
Maybe they didn't have time.

42:11.269 --> 42:12.101
It's just a feeling.

42:12.103 --> 42:13.570
I don't know.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.440
There's no strange activity
on their bank accounts.

42:16.442 --> 42:17.740
Okay.

42:17.742 --> 42:19.142
Okay then.

42:19.144 --> 42:20.577
You okay over there?

42:20.579 --> 42:21.480
Did they feed you?

42:24.617 --> 42:25.849
What is it?

42:25.851 --> 42:27.787
Cherry and Langdon
never reported in.

42:28.753 --> 42:30.086
Langdon was off duty.

42:30.088 --> 42:32.155
Well maybe he left to help.

42:32.157 --> 42:33.757
Nah, they know the protocol.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.126
They should have called in.

42:36.161 --> 42:37.762
Colts and his partner were good.

42:39.197 --> 42:41.197
Cassie confirmed they were
on the ground when shot.

42:41.199 --> 42:43.200
What are you saying, Tom?

42:43.202 --> 42:45.337
Are you saying my
officers are on the take?

42:47.338 --> 42:49.708
I don't think
Kyle has it in him.

42:50.842 --> 42:52.309
Listen to me.

42:52.311 --> 42:54.278
Just because he's
Braddock's kid,

42:54.280 --> 42:56.179
don't let that
cloud your judgment.

42:57.550 --> 42:58.548
Sir.

43:04.056 --> 43:05.222
Katie.

43:07.425 --> 43:08.624
Hello?

43:12.797 --> 43:13.996
Who is this?

43:13.998 --> 43:15.699
Well
now, that's insulting.

43:15.701 --> 43:17.066
I thought we were partners.

43:17.068 --> 43:18.267
Partners?

43:18.269 --> 43:20.103
Are you insane?

43:20.105 --> 43:22.675
That seems to
be the general consensus here.

43:24.777 --> 43:25.610
Who are you?

43:26.512 --> 43:28.110
Where's my daughter?

43:32.083 --> 43:34.418
What do you want
you son of a bitch?

43:34.420 --> 43:35.418
Hey.

43:35.420 --> 43:37.354
Partners don't talk that way.

43:37.356 --> 43:38.287
Stop saying that.

43:38.289 --> 43:40.557
I'm not your goddamn partner.

43:40.559 --> 43:42.059
Of course we are.

43:42.061 --> 43:43.195
I made you chief.

43:45.498 --> 43:48.701
I see from the expression on
your face you remember me.

43:53.405 --> 43:56.273
Do what I say without deviation

43:56.275 --> 43:58.876
or Kyle tosses Katie
into the river.

44:00.211 --> 44:01.811
Wait by the phone.

44:01.813 --> 44:03.847
You'll receive further
instructions soon.

44:06.452 --> 44:08.251
Send those files
to Markou now.

44:08.253 --> 44:09.688
Sweep the house for bugs.

44:10.922 --> 44:11.822
Dammit.

44:11.824 --> 44:14.124
Hey, are you back yet?

44:14.126 --> 44:15.358
All right, I'm sending
you a file now.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.994
When you get back, run the voice

44:16.996 --> 44:18.497
against our Checkmate records.

44:19.831 --> 44:20.665
Yeah.

44:21.534 --> 44:22.532
Tom.

44:24.969 --> 44:25.803
Hey.

44:28.773 --> 44:30.474
It may not be him.

44:30.476 --> 44:32.476
Tom, that madman
has my daughter.

44:37.615 --> 44:40.083
The FBI is in charge.

44:40.085 --> 44:41.717
Let them handle this.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.141
Hello.

45:04.143 --> 45:05.443
Kyle Braddock.

45:06.612 --> 45:08.110
Who is this?

45:08.112 --> 45:10.046
Do as I say
and I give you my word,

45:10.048 --> 45:11.981
Katie will be unharmed.

45:13.985 --> 45:16.855
How do I know you
haven't hurt her already?

45:17.989 --> 45:21.023
I haven't,
but I will hurt her

45:21.025 --> 45:24.193
in the most horrid, gut
wrenching ways you could imagine

45:24.195 --> 45:26.429
if you don't do as I ask.

45:29.367 --> 45:30.702
I want proof she's alive.

45:32.170 --> 45:33.769
- I
- drugged her, Kyle.

45:33.771 --> 45:34.840
She's unconscious.

45:37.309 --> 45:38.742
I'm not doing anything
until I know she's...

45:38.744 --> 45:41.478
Stop talking,
Kyle or I'll kill her

45:41.480 --> 45:43.412
and I'll let the
police kill you.

45:43.414 --> 45:44.680
Don't forget.

45:44.682 --> 45:45.949
They think you're a cop killer

45:45.951 --> 45:47.918
who kidnapped the
chief's daughter.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.885
They don't know about me.

45:49.887 --> 45:51.289
They think this is all you.

45:55.293 --> 45:57.327
You're going to retrieve
something I need.

45:57.329 --> 46:00.296
In exchange, you'll
get Katie back alive.

46:00.298 --> 46:01.065
What?

46:02.800 --> 46:04.333
Chief
Masters' laptop.

46:04.335 --> 46:05.534
What?

46:05.536 --> 46:06.739
It's
in his office.

46:07.940 --> 46:10.240
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

46:10.242 --> 46:12.141
You'll
figure it out.

46:12.143 --> 46:14.644
You have until 0600
hours to bring it to me.

46:14.646 --> 46:15.845
You just said it.

46:15.847 --> 46:17.648
Every cop in this city
is looking for me.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.481
Exactly.

46:18.483 --> 46:19.985
Nobody will look there.

46:20.985 --> 46:22.385
That phone is bugged.

46:22.387 --> 46:23.920
We're tracking you.

46:23.922 --> 46:27.356
If you tamper with it or call
anyone outside of this number,

46:27.358 --> 46:30.327
I'll know and I will hurt Katie.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.028
I promise you that.

46:32.030 --> 46:34.430
Kyle, you want to
do this for me.

46:34.432 --> 46:35.898
Why is that?

46:35.900 --> 46:40.070
Because the white
knight just took your queen.

46:40.072 --> 46:41.204
Check.

48:18.536 --> 48:21.239
They found Nick Cueno's
body in a dumpster downtown.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.409
The note read white
knight takes queen's rook.

48:27.913 --> 48:29.646
Where is everybody?

48:29.648 --> 48:30.847
I sent 'em home.

48:30.849 --> 48:31.680
What?

48:31.682 --> 48:32.851
I don't want 'em here.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.155
What is it?

48:37.588 --> 48:39.690
We found Kyle's DNA at
the crime scene last year.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.161
We didn't think twice about
it because he's his son.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.264
Kyle's not Checkmate, sir.

48:47.266 --> 48:48.632
I know that.

48:48.634 --> 48:51.434
He's a superb medical examiner.

48:51.436 --> 48:54.405
He wouldn't be able to
manipulate our evidence.

48:56.974 --> 48:58.677
I just want you
to prove me wrong.

49:00.411 --> 49:02.179
What am I gonna do, Tom?

49:02.181 --> 49:03.315
Oh, Christ, Catherine.

49:07.018 --> 49:09.619
You okay here
while I follow this?

49:09.621 --> 49:10.422
Go.

49:12.690 --> 49:13.623
I'm calling the FBI.

49:13.625 --> 49:14.925
Let them know you're here alone.

49:14.927 --> 49:16.159
I don't like this.

49:16.161 --> 49:17.963
There are agents
in the street.

49:19.264 --> 49:20.932
I'll call you if he calls again.

49:24.969 --> 49:25.803
And Tom.

49:29.407 --> 49:31.509
If you find Kyle and he resists,

49:33.010 --> 49:35.012
are you prepared to
protect my daughter?

49:37.648 --> 49:41.819
You know you never have
to ask me that question.

49:53.097 --> 49:54.264
Are you alone?

49:54.266 --> 49:55.898
Yeah, I'm alone.

49:55.900 --> 49:58.767
I have no interest in
harming your daughter.

49:58.769 --> 50:00.769
You already have.

50:00.771 --> 50:02.641
That sting
of yours was something.

50:04.509 --> 50:05.844
How'd you get him to talk?

51:54.585 --> 51:55.552
Right here.

51:55.554 --> 51:56.788
It's where he hit his head.

51:58.289 --> 51:59.990
Well that number Checkmate
used came up as a dead end.

51:59.992 --> 52:00.926
It was a burn phone.

52:08.199 --> 52:09.965
Cassie Fucifino.

52:09.967 --> 52:11.367
I didn't kidnap Katie.

52:11.369 --> 52:13.003
Those cops tried to kill us.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.773
Oh yeah?

52:17.775 --> 52:19.777
What about the two you
killed in Katie's apartment?

52:21.545 --> 52:23.479
That was an accident.

52:23.481 --> 52:25.382
You accidentally
shot them repeatedly

52:25.384 --> 52:26.885
while they were on the ground?

52:27.719 --> 52:28.918
Whoa, no.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.387
I didn't shoot
them at all, Cass.

52:30.389 --> 52:32.621
Then why did you confess
to Colts that you did?

52:34.126 --> 52:37.026
I want to come in,
but I don't want to get shot.

52:37.028 --> 52:38.163
Sounds difficult.

52:39.498 --> 52:40.599
RFE one hour.

52:48.440 --> 52:50.206
He called from that number.

52:51.376 --> 52:52.675
What'd he say?

52:52.677 --> 52:54.813
He's innocent
and he wants to come in.

52:56.447 --> 52:57.313
Do you believe him?

52:57.315 --> 52:58.148
Do you?

53:38.856 --> 53:40.090
Hello?

53:40.092 --> 53:42.858
What's
taking so long, Kyle?

53:42.860 --> 53:45.394
Get to the station now.

53:45.396 --> 53:46.329
Whatever, man.

53:46.331 --> 53:48.298
You don't know who's clean

53:48.300 --> 53:50.099
and who I pay on the force.

53:50.101 --> 53:51.068
Remember that.

53:52.204 --> 53:53.903
Katie, wake up.

53:53.905 --> 53:55.003
Ah.

53:55.005 --> 53:56.840
Stop it.

53:56.842 --> 53:59.108
Hurry up, Kyle.

53:59.110 --> 54:01.211
Stop it, please.

54:01.213 --> 54:02.144
You win.

54:02.146 --> 54:03.280
Just please stop hurting her.

54:04.449 --> 54:05.748
Call
me when you arrive.

54:23.001 --> 54:23.835
Hello.

54:25.302 --> 54:26.635
Stay put.

54:26.637 --> 54:28.938
I'll come when I know
you weren't followed.

54:30.708 --> 54:32.342
Dick.

54:32.344 --> 54:33.443
Thanks.

54:47.626 --> 54:49.124
Thank you, Cass.

55:14.920 --> 55:15.787
You okay?

55:17.588 --> 55:18.422
Yeah, why?

55:20.224 --> 55:21.259
You two were close.

55:22.427 --> 55:24.362
You seem to be handling
it better than Cassie.

55:27.431 --> 55:28.697
You never really know
what someone's made of

55:28.699 --> 55:30.501
until you've seen
them at their worst.

55:36.173 --> 55:39.041
Whoever killed Jeff Walters
is controlling Kyle.

55:39.043 --> 55:40.476
It doesn't make sense.

55:40.478 --> 55:41.878
Sure it does.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.813
Super nice forensic
analyst is now a cop killer

55:44.815 --> 55:46.548
who kidnapped the
new chief's daughter

55:46.550 --> 55:48.717
for the serial killer
who killed our old chief

55:48.719 --> 55:50.820
who's now the local
kingpin of sex trafficking.

55:50.822 --> 55:51.722
Case closed.

55:52.590 --> 55:53.625
I should get a medal.

55:54.826 --> 55:56.293
So you're saying
we're being played.

56:01.465 --> 56:03.067
Anything missing from her place?

56:05.070 --> 56:06.403
Her place was torn apart.

56:08.206 --> 56:09.841
Why would she tear
her own place up?

56:11.242 --> 56:13.545
Someone went there looking
for something and tore it up.

56:14.646 --> 56:15.447
What's she into?

56:17.181 --> 56:19.384
Maybe she's just lazy
and lives like that.

56:21.786 --> 56:23.088
You haven't seen my place.

56:26.791 --> 56:27.626
What is it?

56:30.094 --> 56:32.396
Maradona's been slipping
up all of a sudden.

56:33.797 --> 56:36.465
Checkmate referred to
the chief as his partner.

56:36.467 --> 56:38.168
I bet that ruffled
his feathers.

56:39.971 --> 56:41.172
He sent everyone home.

56:42.574 --> 56:44.476
Told the FBI to watch
from the street.

56:48.947 --> 56:50.081
Chief's not involved.

56:51.248 --> 56:52.082
Of course not.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.755
See, this is what
this douchebag wants.

56:58.757 --> 57:00.889
He wants us
questioning everything.

57:00.891 --> 57:02.192
Let's just keep it simple.

57:04.762 --> 57:07.231
We find Kyle, we'll find him.

57:15.873 --> 57:17.375
This is getting out of hand.

57:18.510 --> 57:20.642
What the hell is
the matter with you?

57:20.644 --> 57:22.144
Why did you drop that bitch?

57:22.146 --> 57:24.213
You know you're supposed
to divert attention away,

57:24.215 --> 57:26.518
not put me on a damn front page.

57:27.952 --> 57:30.186
I'm getting tired of your shit.

57:30.188 --> 57:32.487
You're just turning into
some little psychotic.

57:37.528 --> 57:40.229
Let me know when you
get the rest of the money.

58:08.992 --> 58:09.827
Hello?

58:18.936 --> 58:21.137
Why are you making me do this?

58:21.139 --> 58:22.539
Stop stalling.

58:23.907 --> 58:26.976
I mean, you orchestrated
this fantastically.

58:26.978 --> 58:28.577
Why do you want the laptop?

58:28.579 --> 58:29.945
I don't
need my ego stroked.

58:29.947 --> 58:31.447
You're wasting time.

58:31.449 --> 58:34.816
If you fail, she dies
and I disappear forever.

58:34.818 --> 58:36.519
You'll rot in prison
unless that's...

58:36.521 --> 58:37.522
Okay, okay.

58:39.056 --> 58:40.255
I'm going in.

58:40.257 --> 58:41.257
Good.

59:30.641 --> 59:31.574
Chief.

59:31.576 --> 59:32.941
Really?

01:00:04.876 --> 01:00:06.208
Goddammit.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.678
You shit eating dickhead.

01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:09.581
All clear.

01:00:11.081 --> 01:00:12.148
Dammit.

01:00:59.496 --> 01:01:00.229
I'm in.

01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:01.496
Really?

01:01:01.498 --> 01:01:02.332
Yes.

01:01:03.668 --> 01:01:05.333
Good job.

01:01:05.335 --> 01:01:06.236
Grab the laptop.

01:01:21.184 --> 01:01:22.784
Kyle.

01:01:22.786 --> 01:01:25.689
I didn't say break
into the laptop.

01:01:26.858 --> 01:01:28.693
I'm looking
for a laptop case.

01:01:32.096 --> 01:01:32.929
Kyle.

01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.130
Hang on.

01:01:34.132 --> 01:01:35.932
I gotta find something
to carry this in.

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:01.725
Kyle.

01:02:07.297 --> 01:02:08.563
Get down on the ground.

01:02:08.565 --> 01:02:10.166
Kill him, Kyle.

01:02:10.168 --> 01:02:11.099
Get out of there.

01:02:11.101 --> 01:02:13.068
Get down on the ground now.

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.302
No.

01:02:14.304 --> 01:02:15.973
He'll kill her if
you don't let me go.

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:20.344
Kyle,
put me on speaker.

01:02:21.945 --> 01:02:22.947
Okay, Checkmate.

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:31.186
Officer,
I have a knife

01:02:31.188 --> 01:02:32.456
to Katie Masters' throat.

01:02:34.157 --> 01:02:38.762
Drop the gun and kick
it to Kyle or she dies.

01:02:40.898 --> 01:02:41.733
Five.

01:02:44.702 --> 01:02:45.536
Four.

01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:48.403
Three.

01:02:48.405 --> 01:02:49.306
Okay, okay.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:53.410
Don't hurt her.

01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:57.681
Kyle, grab the gun.

01:03:03.454 --> 01:03:04.288
Okay.

01:03:05.757 --> 01:03:06.958
Shoot him.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:10.161
Three.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.964
Two.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.634
One.

01:03:18.536 --> 01:03:19.434
That's it.

01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.780
What the hell?

01:05:52.155 --> 01:05:53.121
Copy that.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.523
The station is on lockdown.

01:05:54.525 --> 01:05:56.527
Suspect last sighted
on Ross and Fourth.

01:05:57.728 --> 01:05:59.128
Detective Murphy is in pursuit.

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:00.832
I repeat Detective in pursuit.

01:06:03.099 --> 01:06:04.934
This is 3612 daylight.

01:06:04.936 --> 01:06:06.336
I'm here on foot.

01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:11.273
They're headed
to Market Square.

01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:13.575
Close off Liberty and Boulevard.

01:06:13.577 --> 01:06:14.510
This is Irizarry.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:15.543
I'm on Fourth and Smithfield.

01:06:15.545 --> 01:06:17.313
No sign of suspect.

01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:47.275
Which way?

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.496
Do you have any idea
where the suspect is?

01:07:11.668 --> 01:07:12.501
Kyle Braddock.

01:07:12.503 --> 01:07:14.071
I repeat Kyle Braddock.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:16.070
10 four.

01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:17.139
1159.

01:07:29.954 --> 01:07:31.452
10 four.

01:07:31.454 --> 01:07:33.488
Does anyone have
eyes on the suspect?

01:07:45.702 --> 01:07:46.735
The Point.

01:07:46.737 --> 01:07:48.137
He's headed for the docks.

01:09:32.576 --> 01:09:33.408
Sorry.

01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.243
Sorry.

01:10:01.337 --> 01:10:02.172
Oh shit.

01:10:07.545 --> 01:10:08.511
Kyle.

01:10:09.412 --> 01:10:11.013
Is she alive?

01:10:21.492 --> 01:10:22.458
Yeah.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.259
It's not there.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:25.393
Back to plan A.

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:26.296
Copy that.

01:10:27.163 --> 01:10:29.031
Kyle's on his way here.

01:10:29.033 --> 01:10:30.898
He's expecting a
trade for Katie.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.868
Understood.

01:10:34.604 --> 01:10:36.873
Well, looks like
I still need you.

01:10:40.243 --> 01:10:41.343
Walsh just texted.

01:10:41.345 --> 01:10:42.146
We lost him.

01:10:43.613 --> 01:10:45.882
Hey, great job letting
him slip away, asshole.

01:10:49.619 --> 01:10:50.818
Jesus.

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.222
You look way shittier
than your usual.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.025
Why would he come here?

01:10:57.027 --> 01:10:58.093
How the hell should I know?

01:10:58.095 --> 01:10:59.460
If it was me, I'd be on my way

01:10:59.462 --> 01:11:01.028
to some country
without extradition.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.030
Mai Tai's.

01:11:02.032 --> 01:11:03.033
Nude beaches.

01:11:04.801 --> 01:11:06.768
He's trying to save her.

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:07.605
You sure?

01:11:08.471 --> 01:11:10.304
I just don't know anymore.

01:11:10.306 --> 01:11:11.540
Jesus.

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:13.511
I'm just tired and
I haven't eaten.

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:16.113
Go home.

01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:19.180
No, I'm good.

01:11:19.182 --> 01:11:20.715
Night watch guy.

01:11:20.717 --> 01:11:23.317
He was dead at least an hour
before Kyle stole my badge.

01:11:23.319 --> 01:11:25.486
Security footage
has been deleted.

01:11:25.488 --> 01:11:27.222
Same with the backup server.

01:11:30.094 --> 01:11:31.295
He really is innocent.

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:34.196
You can't tell from the video,

01:11:34.198 --> 01:11:36.498
but if you watch it
about 10,000 times,

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.267
you see this guy fall back

01:11:38.269 --> 01:11:40.402
and a small device fall
down to the ground.

01:11:40.404 --> 01:11:41.405
That's Kyle's phone.

01:11:45.442 --> 01:11:47.608
He didn't run into kidnap her.

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.679
He ran into save her.

01:11:51.047 --> 01:11:53.514
He also stopped into
appreciate the art.

01:11:58.421 --> 01:11:59.821
The feds just found Maradona

01:11:59.823 --> 01:12:02.290
and Kravitz dead
down by The Point.

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:03.860
Murdered execution style.

01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:05.728
Was there a note?

01:12:07.398 --> 01:12:09.097
They text it to me.

01:12:09.099 --> 01:12:12.636
White knight overthrows white
king and white king's bishop.

01:12:13.804 --> 01:12:16.640
White knight expels all
pawns and is now king.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.208
Holy shit.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.043
Jesus.

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:22.577
I'll be in the lab.

01:12:27.984 --> 01:12:29.385
It's also a list of names.

01:12:30.253 --> 01:12:32.321
Politicians and officers all

01:12:32.323 --> 01:12:35.190
on the take including the chief.

01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:03.919
Shit.

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:06.848
Yeah, Cass.

01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:08.717
Tom,
Checkmate's dead.

01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:10.384
The blood on the wall at
WingHart's didn't match

01:14:10.386 --> 01:14:11.753
any we'd found in the past.

01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:13.754
I ran across a photo
of Jeff Walters.

01:14:13.756 --> 01:14:16.191
He had a tattoo of
a queen on his arm.

01:14:16.193 --> 01:14:18.427
Never thought of it before
because it was an actual queen,

01:14:18.429 --> 01:14:19.827
not you know the piece.

01:14:19.829 --> 01:14:22.830
Anyway, I compared Walter's DNA

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:25.334
to old samples we found
on Checkmate's victims

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.068
and it matched three.

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:28.271
He was Checkmate.

01:14:29.573 --> 01:14:30.507
Good work, Cass.

01:14:32.609 --> 01:14:33.610
New guy's a poser.

01:14:35.645 --> 01:14:37.111
This is bullshit.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.384
What?

01:14:41.885 --> 01:14:42.686
Say it.

01:14:43.921 --> 01:14:44.785
He's all alone.

01:14:44.787 --> 01:14:45.653
You said it yourself.

01:14:45.655 --> 01:14:46.588
He kicked everyone out.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:47.621
You don't think that's weird?

01:14:47.623 --> 01:14:48.456
So what?

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:49.292
FBI's there.

01:14:50.127 --> 01:14:51.095
Did you see them?

01:14:55.599 --> 01:14:57.400
Like I'm not saying.

01:14:59.069 --> 01:15:00.835
His daughter, man.

01:15:09.813 --> 01:15:11.479
Just like you said.

01:15:11.481 --> 01:15:13.182
It's exactly what he wanted.

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:16.954
Us chasing our tails and
going after each other.

01:15:19.122 --> 01:15:22.424
Look, security was compromised.

01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:24.925
We've been running all over
the place away from here

01:15:24.927 --> 01:15:27.396
thinking this is
about trafficking.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:29.867
This isn't about Kyle
or Katie or any of us.

01:15:31.335 --> 01:15:33.367
This is about a goddamn heist.

01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:34.803
Wait a minute.

01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:36.006
Evidence was cleared.

01:15:37.073 --> 01:15:38.540
It's not down there.

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:39.376
Where is it?

01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:42.244
I don't know.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.879
Who does?

01:15:47.885 --> 01:15:49.785
You stay on Kyle and Katie.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.920
If you call it in, she dies.

01:15:52.922 --> 01:15:53.988
I got this.

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:55.016
Dispatch.

01:16:55.018 --> 01:16:56.550
Hi, this is Lieutenant Markou.

01:16:56.552 --> 01:16:58.919
Can I get a trace on Lieutenant
Walsh's phone please?

01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:00.187
Route it to my mobile.

01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:01.156
Of
course, Detective.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.357
Great.

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:19.641
Dispatch.

01:17:19.643 --> 01:17:22.309
Yeah, this is
Lieutenant Markou again.

01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:25.946
I need a vehicle report
on Detective Murphy.

01:17:25.948 --> 01:17:28.083
Absolutely,
Detective Markou.

01:17:28.085 --> 01:17:29.584
Thank you.

01:17:58.381 --> 01:18:00.447
Jeff Walters was Checkmate.

01:18:00.449 --> 01:18:03.151
It's the body that washed
ashore a few days ago.

01:18:03.153 --> 01:18:05.286
We found Maradona and
Senator Kravitz murdered

01:18:05.288 --> 01:18:06.722
down by the point last night.

01:18:08.358 --> 01:18:13.327
No suspects yet, but whoever
did it left a list of names.

01:18:13.329 --> 01:18:17.768
Politicians, police officers
all on Maradona's dime.

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.104
Your name was on that list.

01:18:26.777 --> 01:18:27.844
Good job.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.414
Oh yeah.

01:18:32.282 --> 01:18:33.115
Kyle is innocent.

01:18:35.152 --> 01:18:36.587
Markou has proof.

01:20:44.146 --> 01:20:44.978
Katie.

01:20:50.319 --> 01:20:51.518
Murphy?

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.830
How could you work
for Checkmate?

01:21:02.832 --> 01:21:04.432
Wake up, Kyle,
there's no Checkmate.

01:21:04.434 --> 01:21:05.268
There never was.

01:21:06.203 --> 01:21:07.604
The computer now.

01:21:10.907 --> 01:21:12.107
No.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.345
Quiet.

01:22:19.408 --> 01:22:20.509
Where is she?

01:22:22.511 --> 01:22:23.746
I thought that was her.

01:22:27.516 --> 01:22:29.251
Murph said Checkmate
wasn't real.

01:22:30.886 --> 01:22:33.489
Maradona created
Checkmate as a cover.

01:22:34.623 --> 01:22:36.825
There are many Checkmates.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:38.528
They're all hiding
organized hits.

01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:45.135
Where we going?

01:22:46.302 --> 01:22:47.136
Find Katie.

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.951
Well.

01:23:03.386 --> 01:23:04.387
Here we are.

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:06.989
Good.

01:23:09.426 --> 01:23:10.258
Let's go.

01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:22.404
Sorry, Chief.

01:23:24.106 --> 01:23:25.973
Thought it was
all accounted for.

01:23:25.975 --> 01:23:26.909
No sweat, Rudy.

01:23:28.345 --> 01:23:29.179
You know.

01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:32.615
You told me to not
even stop for you, sir.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:34.781
I know.

01:23:34.783 --> 01:23:35.583
Thanks.

01:23:35.585 --> 01:23:36.451
It's cool, I got it.

01:23:37.287 --> 01:23:38.085
No.

01:23:38.087 --> 01:23:38.919
Dammit.

01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:40.120
Jesus Christ.

01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:43.223
Your batch will be there.

01:24:19.662 --> 01:24:21.330
Why don't we
just take his car?

01:24:23.265 --> 01:24:25.768
Try to trap me
again and Katie dies.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.602
What do you need me for?

01:24:28.604 --> 01:24:29.605
Just let her go.

01:24:30.974 --> 01:24:33.677
You think I don't know they're
are tracers in those bags?

01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:38.912
You think I don't know that
that's only half the shipment?

01:24:58.234 --> 01:24:59.200
Katie.

01:25:06.842 --> 01:25:08.409
Get the bag.

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.951
You know what?

01:25:49.953 --> 01:25:50.918
Half is enough.

01:26:17.579 --> 01:26:19.179
Katie.

01:26:19.181 --> 01:26:20.781
Katie, Katie.

01:27:03.725 --> 01:27:05.026
Katie.

01:27:05.028 --> 01:27:05.862
Honey.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:07.764
Katie.

01:27:09.832 --> 01:27:10.666
Dad.

01:27:13.036 --> 01:27:14.436
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:27:16.672 --> 01:27:18.273
Ambulance is on the way, hun.

01:27:39.061 --> 01:27:39.996
All good.

01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:43.699
She's okay.

01:27:44.667 --> 01:27:45.602
She is.

01:27:56.345 --> 01:27:57.179
You guys okay?

01:27:58.581 --> 01:27:59.548
Yeah, we're good.

01:28:02.018 --> 01:28:02.918
I hurt you though.

01:28:04.087 --> 01:28:05.588
I only had a few
seconds to think.

01:28:06.722 --> 01:28:08.121
They took Katie as
leverage for the funds

01:28:08.123 --> 01:28:08.955
and then we realized...

01:28:08.957 --> 01:28:10.124
Got it.

01:28:11.426 --> 01:28:12.828
Never doubted you, Chief.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.664
Good work, you too.

01:28:20.036 --> 01:28:21.134
Kou.

01:28:58.515 --> 01:29:03.515
