00:00.571 --> 00:03.133
<i>EMMA: A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

00:03.135 --> 00:05.452
<i>And then she asked me to take her place,</i>

00:05.460 --> 00:08.042
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

00:08.045 --> 00:09.836
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:10.470 --> 00:11.735
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:11.745 --> 00:14.482
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

00:15.142 --> 00:16.309
If Ted is really my father,

00:16.343 --> 00:18.111
<i>I can't believe that he</i>

00:18.145 --> 00:19.345
would be a killer, too.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.114
Derek's mother brought them by my office.

00:21.148 --> 00:22.348
We have to stake out that cemetery.

00:22.383 --> 00:24.884
This whole thing would
be a lot easier for me

00:24.919 --> 00:26.886
if you just tell me what Alec
told you when he was in jail.

00:26.921 --> 00:29.189
- You still think Alec killed Derek?
- Who else would want to protect

00:29.223 --> 00:32.091
the secret of the twins so
badly they'd kill for it?

00:32.125 --> 00:33.693
You shouldn't tell Ethan anything.

00:33.727 --> 00:34.828
Keep this between us.

00:34.862 --> 00:36.062
Oh, is that a touchy subject?

00:37.932 --> 00:40.667
I think you know you made
a mistake choosing Thayer.

00:42.002 --> 00:43.603
Son, if you're in trouble with Rebecca,

00:43.637 --> 00:44.838
I can help you out.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.829
Our marriage is over.

00:46.864 --> 00:48.531
Did you kiss my wife?

00:48.566 --> 00:50.633
Yes, I did. Bastard!

00:50.668 --> 00:51.868
Theresa, it's Sutton Mercer.

00:51.902 --> 00:53.770
I have some startling things

00:53.804 --> 00:55.471
you may want to know.

00:57.441 --> 00:59.409
You?

01:00.244 --> 01:03.646
(organ music plays)

01:11.715 --> 01:14.483
Any luck? Another voice mail.

01:14.518 --> 01:16.452
I've already left ten messages.

01:17.554 --> 01:19.555
Where could she be?

01:19.589 --> 01:20.723
Mr. Whitehorse,

01:20.757 --> 01:22.725
we were supposed to
get started an hour ago.

01:22.759 --> 01:23.693
I know. I know.

01:23.727 --> 01:25.227
Just a few more minutes.

01:25.262 --> 01:26.228
She's coming, she'll be here.

01:26.263 --> 01:27.396
Well, are you sure?

01:27.431 --> 01:29.298
I mean, eh, she wouldn't be the first bride

01:29.333 --> 01:30.366
to get cold feet.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.234
Theresa doesn't have cold feet.

01:32.269 --> 01:33.436
If she's not here, there's
a good reason for it.

01:33.470 --> 01:34.470
Okay.

01:37.074 --> 01:39.008
Hey, I'm going to go look out

01:39.042 --> 01:40.409
in the parking lot for her, okay?

01:40.444 --> 01:42.244
Yeah. I mean, she's coming.

01:42.279 --> 01:43.379
I'm sure she's on her way.

01:43.413 --> 01:45.982
Of course, she is. Yup.

01:52.923 --> 01:55.057
SUTTON: So much for "Here Comes the Bride."

01:57.194 --> 01:58.661
Sutton,

01:58.695 --> 01:59.829
what are you doing here?

01:59.863 --> 02:00.763
Same thing you are.

02:00.797 --> 02:02.832
Looking for Theresa.

02:02.816 --> 02:04.684
She always this late to
things, or just weddings?

02:04.718 --> 02:05.918
Why are you looking for Theresa?

02:05.953 --> 02:08.687
Because I want to talk to
her about Derek's murder.

02:08.722 --> 02:10.389
I have some thoughts.

02:11.591 --> 02:13.392
It's weird that she isn't here, isn't it?

02:13.427 --> 02:15.361
Uh, not as weird as you
trying to talk to her

02:15.395 --> 02:16.462
right before she walks down the aisle.

02:19.433 --> 02:22.435
I know Emma convinced you not to trust me.

02:24.338 --> 02:26.439
But you broke up with
me for the wrong reasons.

02:26.473 --> 02:28.341
We don't have time to do
this right now, all right?

02:28.375 --> 02:29.508
You need to go back to
the cabin before you ruin

02:29.543 --> 02:31.110
their wedding day.

02:31.144 --> 02:33.379
Given the shocking lack of a bride,

02:33.413 --> 02:35.081
don't you think it's already ruined?

02:35.115 --> 02:36.382
DAN: Ethan?

02:36.416 --> 02:37.950
G... g.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.085
DAN: Ethan?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.254
Hey.

02:42.289 --> 02:44.857
There's still no sign of her.

02:44.891 --> 02:46.192
I think that, uh,

02:46.226 --> 02:49.895
that, uh, maybe we should
check the hospitals.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.197
I'm sure she's okay.

02:51.231 --> 02:53.799
There's got to be a good
explanation for this.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.701
Yeah, I don't, I don't know, you know?

02:55.736 --> 02:56.802
Maybe, maybe there is.

02:56.837 --> 02:59.638
I mean, the Derek Rogers murder case,

02:59.673 --> 03:00.740
she was obsessed with that.

03:00.774 --> 03:02.675
Well, what are you thinking?

03:02.709 --> 03:03.943
I don't know.

03:03.977 --> 03:05.578
I don't know what I'm thinking.

03:05.612 --> 03:07.580
I just know I need to find her.

I know it was stupid.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.942
- Yeah, it was.
- Okay, well,

03:36.977 --> 03:38.611
then, tell me how I can make it better.

03:39.846 --> 03:41.714
I hate how this is coming between us, Emma.

Just don't make it any harder on me.

03:45.018 --> 03:46.819
Okay?

03:46.853 --> 03:48.854
Things are falling apart around here.

03:48.889 --> 03:49.989
Is this about your dad?

03:51.625 --> 03:52.792
You know he's not the killer.

03:52.826 --> 03:53.759
He can't be.

03:53.794 --> 03:54.894
I know that.

03:54.928 --> 03:56.829
And that's why I want to clear his name.

03:58.999 --> 04:02.001
Kristin served him with
divorce papers last night.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.769
Emma.

04:03.804 --> 04:05.004
I'm, I'm sorry.

04:05.038 --> 04:06.806
I, I should have been there for you.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.873
I try... I tried calling.

04:07.908 --> 04:10.910
I didn't feel like talking.

04:15.749 --> 04:18.817
I'm here for you now.

04:18.851 --> 04:20.886
I just, I need to talk to Ted.

04:20.921 --> 04:22.822
I know he'll have an explanation,

04:22.856 --> 04:25.558
and then we can get back on the trail

04:25.592 --> 04:27.560
of who really did this.

04:27.594 --> 04:30.029
Yeah.

04:39.606 --> 04:43.542
(Ted breathes heavily)

04:56.957 --> 04:58.624
So,

04:58.658 --> 05:00.960
um, unfortunately, we are not going

05:00.994 --> 05:02.761
to be having a wedding today.

05:02.796 --> 05:08.868
Okay? Uh, Dan wanted to
thank you all for coming.

05:08.902 --> 05:10.936
Uh, you know, I'm sure
everything will be okay.

05:10.971 --> 05:12.905
And we'll be back here soon.

05:12.939 --> 05:15.608
Thank you.

05:15.642 --> 05:17.443
(guests murmur)

05:20.680 --> 05:21.714
Dan! Dan, hey!

05:21.748 --> 05:24.250
- Where you going?
- Where do you think?

05:24.284 --> 05:25.518
To find out what the hell is going on.

05:25.552 --> 05:28.187
- I'm coming with you.
- Get in.

05:34.194 --> 05:36.262
Poor guy.

05:36.296 --> 05:38.230
I thought you said they
were really into each other.

05:38.265 --> 05:41.300
Well, maybe she was hiding something.

05:41.334 --> 05:43.068
Or he was.

05:43.103 --> 05:44.970
Just don't know with some people.

05:45.005 --> 05:46.005
Great.

05:46.039 --> 05:47.873
Here we go again.

05:47.908 --> 05:49.875
Where'd you go last night, anyway?

05:49.910 --> 05:52.178
Needed some time to think.

05:52.212 --> 05:53.812
Be alone.

05:53.847 --> 05:56.682
Well, I've been doing some thinking, too,

05:56.716 --> 05:58.918
about all the secrets you could be hiding.

05:58.952 --> 06:02.588
And the truth is, it really scares me.

06:02.622 --> 06:05.558
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Mads.

06:05.592 --> 06:07.493
Well, I don't know what to believe anymore.

06:07.527 --> 06:09.862
How am I supposed to trust you, Jordan?

06:09.896 --> 06:14.833
All right, what if I tell you
that I was done with Rebecca?

06:14.868 --> 06:16.435
Forever.

06:16.469 --> 06:18.771
I would say you have to prove it.

06:29.282 --> 06:30.516
Jordan, are you okay?

06:30.550 --> 06:34.119
Oh, I'm perfect. Thanks for asking.

06:34.154 --> 06:35.287
You ready?

06:35.322 --> 06:37.489
Yeah, I'm all set.

06:37.524 --> 06:40.159
Did, uh, did you talk to Dan?

06:40.193 --> 06:41.160
No.

06:41.194 --> 06:42.294
He left too quick.

06:42.329 --> 06:43.262
I'll catch up with him later.

06:43.296 --> 06:45.064
It's so strange.

06:45.098 --> 06:47.032
I can't believe that Theresa
would leave him at the altar.

06:50.103 --> 06:52.271
I really hate it when
you stare at me like that.

06:52.305 --> 06:54.039
I'm just curious.

06:54.074 --> 06:56.141
You leave the rehearsal dinner early

06:56.176 --> 06:58.777
saying you've got a tummy ache,

06:58.812 --> 07:00.813
yet when I get home, you're not there.

07:00.847 --> 07:03.015
I told you, I went to the pharmacy,

07:03.049 --> 07:04.984
and when I got home, the bed was empty,

07:05.018 --> 07:06.885
and you still haven't
told me where you were.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.654
That's right.

07:08.688 --> 07:09.688
I haven't.

07:12.926 --> 07:15.561
I know how hard this has
been on you and Sutton.

07:15.595 --> 07:17.396
I never wanted any of this to happen.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.831
Then explain it.

07:18.925 --> 07:21.393
How could you do this to Mom?

07:21.428 --> 07:22.494
And to us?

07:22.529 --> 07:24.463
The affair, the missing money. It... 

07:24.497 --> 07:26.465
All you've done is lie. I know.

07:26.499 --> 07:27.466
I know.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.335
We're not trying to attack you.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.470
We just want to understand what happened.

07:31.504 --> 07:33.339
I don't know where to begin.

07:34.441 --> 07:36.375
All that matters is, I'm sorry.

07:38.111 --> 07:39.378
I'm sorry.

07:46.052 --> 07:47.920
Maybe you should go now.

07:47.954 --> 07:49.288
Sorry, girls, but your dad
should not be here right now.

07:49.322 --> 07:51.090
I am seeing my daughters.

07:51.124 --> 07:53.959
- If you could give us a minute, please.
- No, I can't.

07:53.993 --> 07:55.894
I told you, if you want to come by,

07:55.929 --> 07:57.730
you need to make
arrangements with me first.

07:57.764 --> 07:59.698
- Kristin, please!
- Do I have to call the lawyer?

07:59.733 --> 08:00.699
This is our agreement that we have

08:00.734 --> 08:01.834
- between the two of us.
- I'm seeing my daughters!

08:01.868 --> 08:02.835
Guys, please, please, please,

08:02.869 --> 08:03.969
please don't fight.

08:05.739 --> 08:08.540
Dad, Laurel and I will
come to the club for dinner.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.743
It will give us a chance
to talk about everything,

08:10.777 --> 08:13.846
and... are you free tonight?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.714
Yeah.

08:15.749 --> 08:18.550
I guess.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.685
Mom, is that okay with you?

08:19.719 --> 08:21.520
- It's fine.
- Good.

08:21.554 --> 08:23.322
Then it's settled. We'll
see you tonight, Dad.

08:23.356 --> 08:25.257
Good-bye, girls.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.525
Just know, whatever happens, I love you.

08:40.472 --> 08:44.943
Theresa, you in there, you okay?!

08:44.978 --> 08:45.978
Hey, look, look, man... 

08:46.012 --> 08:47.045
Get out of the way.

08:55.088 --> 08:56.054
Theresa?

09:00.160 --> 09:01.960
I'll check the bedroom.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.802
Theresa?

09:32.459 --> 09:34.326
All her clothes are gone.

09:36.396 --> 09:38.163
What's that?

09:39.365 --> 09:42.401
I found it on the counter.

09:52.879 --> 09:58.150
No. No.

09:58.184 --> 10:00.986
She would never leave me like this.

10:03.957 --> 10:07.993
Not without a... a message.

10:08.027 --> 10:11.797
Or a note.

10:11.831 --> 10:12.965
The ring, Dan.

10:12.999 --> 10:14.032
And her clothes are gone.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.601
No!

10:15.635 --> 10:16.935
No.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.705
She, she got too close.

10:19.739 --> 10:21.840
She knew something,

10:21.875 --> 10:26.645
and he, he found her and,

10:26.679 --> 10:28.547
and he took her from me.

10:28.581 --> 10:31.550
Ethan, he could have, he
could have gotten her keys.

10:31.584 --> 10:33.619
Left, left the ring here.

10:33.653 --> 10:34.720
On purpose.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.355
You know, to make me think... 

10:36.389 --> 10:37.523
What, what are you, what
are you talking about?

10:37.557 --> 10:40.492
I'm talking about Derek's killer.

10:40.527 --> 10:44.396
Now, whoever he or she is,

10:44.430 --> 10:45.531
Theresa was hot on the trail of that

10:45.565 --> 10:48.300
and there was, you know, the flowers.

10:48.334 --> 10:50.335
She was, she was obsessed with finding out

10:50.370 --> 10:53.205
who was leaving flowers on Derek's grave.

10:53.239 --> 10:56.141
Somebody was leaving
flowers on Derek's grave?

11:02.181 --> 11:03.949
Dan, wait!

11:03.983 --> 11:04.917
Dan.

11:07.964 --> 11:11.667
Sutton. I know you're in there. Come on.

11:12.702 --> 11:13.902
What?

11:17.907 --> 11:20.609
I have been worried about you.

11:20.643 --> 11:23.445
I haven't heard from you since my... 

11:23.479 --> 11:25.714
- little confession.
- Little?

11:25.748 --> 11:27.382
You are my mother.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.484
I am supposed to be able to trust you.

11:29.519 --> 11:30.786
Well, sometimes parents have to lie

11:30.820 --> 11:32.588
to their children to protect them.

11:32.622 --> 11:36.358
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me?

11:36.392 --> 11:38.627
I don't know.

11:38.661 --> 11:41.263
Do I know everything now?

11:41.297 --> 11:42.497
Absolutely.

11:42.532 --> 11:44.399
What about Theresa?

11:44.434 --> 11:47.336
Word is that she didn't
show up for her own wedding.

11:47.370 --> 11:50.272
Yes.

11:50.306 --> 11:52.107
Troubling, isn't it?

11:52.141 --> 11:53.942
She's Alec's attorney.

11:53.977 --> 11:56.044
<i>She knows a lot about the case.</i>

11:56.079 --> 11:58.046
I was thinking the same thing.

11:58.081 --> 12:02.317
You don't think Alec did
anything to her, do you?

12:02.352 --> 12:04.820
Or... maybe

12:04.854 --> 12:07.823
that uber-villain that you were
telling me about did something.

12:07.857 --> 12:11.026
Maybe he is going to frame Alec.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.963
Or you will.

12:14.998 --> 12:16.031
What's this about, Sutton?

12:16.065 --> 12:17.599
I'm just... 

12:17.634 --> 12:19.701
speculating.

12:20.703 --> 12:22.504
Hmm.

12:22.538 --> 12:24.906
Well, I have something for you.

12:24.941 --> 12:26.842
Something special.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.411
Actually the reason I came.

12:33.716 --> 12:35.584
One half for you.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.655
And the other half I'm saving for Emma.

12:41.324 --> 12:45.394
It symbolizes our broken family
coming back together again.

12:45.428 --> 12:48.530
You and your sister and... 

12:50.366 --> 12:52.401
your father kissed me last night.

12:53.436 --> 12:56.138
You were with Ted last night?

12:56.172 --> 12:57.305
Briefly.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.374
Kristin served him divorce papers.

12:59.409 --> 13:01.243
He wanted to see me.

13:03.212 --> 13:05.914
I really think he's
starting to trust me again.

13:07.116 --> 13:09.885
Almost sounds too good to be true.

13:16.651 --> 13:18.174
<i>EMMA: Theresa's missing? Since when?</i>

13:18.180 --> 13:20.962
MADS: Well, apparently since last
night after the rehearsal dinner.

13:20.997 --> 13:22.931
And no one knows why she didn't show up

13:22.965 --> 13:23.899
to the wedding today.

13:25.601 --> 13:26.902
What?

13:26.936 --> 13:28.537
You know something?

13:28.571 --> 13:29.838
She was just still looking

13:29.872 --> 13:31.940
into Derek's murder... Ethan told me.

13:31.974 --> 13:33.875
Oh, my God, you don't think that... 

13:33.910 --> 13:35.444
Someone might have targeted her,

13:35.478 --> 13:36.545
because of what she knew?

13:36.579 --> 13:38.847
Rebecca, if she killed Derek.

13:38.881 --> 13:41.817
Wait, you think Rebecca killed Derek?

13:41.851 --> 13:44.319
- It's possible.
- Why didn't you tell me?

13:44.353 --> 13:46.321
Okay, wait a second, you
still suspect Rebecca?

13:46.355 --> 13:48.657
Because after the formal, I
thought you might have changed

13:48.691 --> 13:49.558
your minds.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.161
No, we... we just needed time

13:53.196 --> 13:55.097
- to think things through.
- THAYER: Speaking of, Mads, 

13:55.131 --> 13:57.065
do you know where our dad was last night?

13:57.100 --> 13:58.500
Yeah, he came home with me
after the rehearsal dinner.

13:58.534 --> 14:00.969
- And then...
- Then what?

14:01.003 --> 14:04.072
He went out again.

14:04.107 --> 14:04.907
But that doesn't mean anything. 

14:04.908 --> 14:06.292
Every time something bad happens, 

14:06.293 --> 14:07.876
you can't blame it on him, Thayer.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.311
I mean, my God, for all we know

14:09.345 --> 14:12.214
Theresa just freaked out about
getting married and took off.

14:12.248 --> 14:15.751
- It happens.
- (sighs) But if she didn't just run away...

14:17.829 --> 14:19.930
I got to go.

14:24.836 --> 14:27.738
Emma, hey!

14:27.773 --> 14:28.973
Hey, hey.

14:29.007 --> 14:30.641
Just slow down.

14:30.675 --> 14:31.942
Ted wouldn't hurt Theresa or Derek.

14:31.977 --> 14:33.644
Only a psychopath would do that.

14:33.678 --> 14:34.879
And that isn't Ted.

14:34.913 --> 14:36.747
Shh. But you're worried how it looks.

14:36.782 --> 14:38.783
Yes. Thayer, think about the timing.

14:38.817 --> 14:41.485
Theresa finds out about the
blackmail money and then... 

14:41.520 --> 14:44.421
disappears a few days later?

14:44.456 --> 14:46.390
That doesn't look good for Ted.

14:46.424 --> 14:48.392
Which is why we have to keep
this quiet now more than ever.

14:48.426 --> 14:49.760
I just need to find out where he was

14:49.795 --> 14:52.496
last night so I can prove
that he didn't hurt Theresa.

14:52.531 --> 14:53.697
Are you just gonna ask him?

14:53.732 --> 14:58.202
No. I have an idea, but I need your help.

14:58.236 --> 14:59.603
- Okay.
- Come with me.

15:03.341 --> 15:05.342
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:06.478 --> 15:08.345
You look beautiful.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.447
Thank you for the flowers. They... 

15:10.482 --> 15:12.183
they were so sweet.

15:12.217 --> 15:14.318
- What are you drinking?
- I'll have a...

15:14.352 --> 15:16.353
- cranberry vodka.
- BARTENDER: Got it.

15:16.388 --> 15:18.222
Thank you.

15:18.256 --> 15:20.090
Listen, Alec, I... 

15:20.125 --> 15:22.092
I served Ted with papers.

15:22.127 --> 15:24.228
It's over.

15:24.262 --> 15:26.197
I wish I could say I'm sorry.

15:26.231 --> 15:28.032
But I'm not.

15:28.066 --> 15:29.900
I mean, you're still married.

15:29.935 --> 15:32.036
Technically, I'm not
even divorced yet, so... 

15:32.070 --> 15:33.838
Aw, listen, I got married

15:33.872 --> 15:35.206
for all the wrong... all the wrong reasons,

15:35.240 --> 15:37.808
and as soon as I can,
I'm going to correct that.

15:37.843 --> 15:40.911
- I was thinking about my daughters.
- 'Course you are.

15:40.946 --> 15:43.047
Do you want me to walk away from this,

15:43.081 --> 15:44.882
is that what you're saying?

15:44.916 --> 15:48.719
(whispering): No, I don't
want that either. I just... 

15:48.753 --> 15:50.554
it's complicated.

15:50.589 --> 15:52.423
Well, let's... 

15:52.457 --> 15:53.791
make it uncomplicated.

15:53.825 --> 15:55.826
What are you doing this evening?

15:55.861 --> 15:59.763
Well, Ted has the girls,
and I don't have plans.

15:59.798 --> 16:01.498
So have dinner with me.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.500
Like a date?

16:03.535 --> 16:05.703
We'll be discreet.

16:05.737 --> 16:08.439
I'm not taking no for an answer.

16:08.473 --> 16:10.241
This is like when we were in high school

16:10.275 --> 16:11.542
and you made me climb that water tower.

16:11.576 --> 16:13.210
You dared me to climb that water tower.

16:13.245 --> 16:14.211
- You loved it.
- It was...

16:14.246 --> 16:15.479
terrified... it was pitch black.

16:15.513 --> 16:17.214
Are you sorry you did it?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.050
No.

16:21.186 --> 16:22.319
(sighs)

16:22.354 --> 16:24.355
Okay.

16:24.389 --> 16:26.056
I'm in.

16:26.091 --> 16:28.292
(phone ringing)

16:28.326 --> 16:29.360
One second.

16:32.931 --> 16:34.331
Alec Rybak.

16:37.302 --> 16:39.837
(siren blares)

16:39.871 --> 16:42.206
I need you to tape off
the area around this grave.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.742
Get the techs out here.
This is a crime scene.

16:44.776 --> 16:46.076
You said this had something
to do with Theresa.

16:46.111 --> 16:47.811
Yeah, it does, I think she came here

16:47.846 --> 16:49.013
last night before she went missing.

16:49.047 --> 16:50.614
There's women's footprints everywhere,

16:50.649 --> 16:51.949
along with another set... a man.

16:51.983 --> 16:53.918
So we need to get him identified right now.

16:53.952 --> 16:55.819
Dan, it's a cemetery. A lot
of people come through... 

16:55.854 --> 16:57.588
I... I don't care what it is!

16:57.622 --> 16:59.723
Theresa's life could be
on the line. Hey, come on!

16:59.758 --> 17:00.858
Did anyone call the detectives yet?

17:00.892 --> 17:01.892
Where the hell are they?

17:01.927 --> 17:03.894
Give me this.

17:03.929 --> 17:05.762
You want to explain this to me?

17:05.797 --> 17:07.698
ETHAN: I think Dan just did.

17:07.732 --> 17:09.733
I'm starting to agree with him.

17:14.638 --> 17:16.573
Thank you, officers.

17:16.608 --> 17:20.277
It's all right. There
seems to have been a bit

17:20.311 --> 17:21.512
of a misunderstanding here.

17:21.546 --> 17:22.646
You guys head back.

17:22.681 --> 17:25.281
My office has this.

17:25.317 --> 17:29.320
Officer Whitehorse, can
I talk to you for a sec?

17:31.256 --> 17:33.123
(whispering): What the
hell's going on, Dan?

17:33.158 --> 17:34.425
Something happened to
Theresa, and you know it.

17:34.459 --> 17:36.093
She was all over this case.

17:36.127 --> 17:37.328
What do you think,

17:37.362 --> 17:39.229
<i>- the killer came after her?
- Yes, I do.</i>

17:39.264 --> 17:41.398
And now you're gonna help me
find her. No, come on, man.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.133
You're too close to this, okay?

17:43.168 --> 17:44.201
You're gonna get yourself hurt.

17:44.235 --> 17:46.003
What you should do is go home,

17:46.037 --> 17:48.105
take some time off and leave it to me.

17:48.139 --> 17:50.007
The hell I will. This
whole thing is your fault.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.909
She got too close to
something because of whatever

17:51.943 --> 17:53.210
you said to her when she was your lawyer!

17:53.244 --> 17:55.112
I wish I could walk that back... 

17:55.146 --> 17:56.246
DAN: Now you're gonna tell me what it is.

17:56.281 --> 17:57.948
- You're gonna tell me!
- If I had the time...

17:57.983 --> 17:59.049
ETHAN: Come on, come on, Dan!

17:59.084 --> 18:00.951
- Swear to God!
- Dan, let it go, man.

18:00.986 --> 18:02.686
What did you say, Alec?!

18:02.721 --> 18:04.922
Danny, that's not the way
to go about this, man, okay?

18:04.956 --> 18:07.658
You think I'm gonna drop this?

18:07.692 --> 18:09.593
I suppose not.

18:09.627 --> 18:11.628
You're damn right.

18:22.133 --> 18:22.438
Thanks for checking the records for us J.J. 

18:24.441 --> 18:27.142
I promise, your meals are
on me for the next week.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.311
Look, just let's keep
it between us, all right?

18:29.345 --> 18:31.146
Our members' comings and goings
are supposed to be private.

18:31.181 --> 18:33.015
I know, don't worry about it.

18:33.049 --> 18:35.317
I just need to know if my
dad was here last night. Nope.

18:35.351 --> 18:38.053
Picked up his car from
the valet at 10:08 p.m.

18:38.087 --> 18:40.189
What time did he come back?

18:40.223 --> 18:43.258
Uh, 4:21 a.m.

18:43.293 --> 18:46.829
(laughs) Must have had one hell of a night.

18:48.164 --> 18:49.131
Hey, J.J. Hey.

18:49.165 --> 18:50.098
Guys, I need to talk to you.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.099
THAYER: Thanks, man.

18:51.134 --> 18:52.734
I appreciate it.

18:54.971 --> 18:57.005
- What was that about?
- I was, uh,

18:57.040 --> 18:59.775
seeing about applying
for a part-time valet job.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.777
I just wanted some extra cash on the side.

19:01.811 --> 19:02.711
Are you applying, too?

19:02.745 --> 19:04.746
No, I'm with him.

19:05.982 --> 19:07.883
Of course.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.686
We're really sorry about Theresa.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.421
We heard.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.389
Actually, I think
something happened to her... 

19:14.424 --> 19:18.360
and it's somehow tied to Derek's murder.

19:19.562 --> 19:21.396
THAYER: Okay.

19:21.431 --> 19:22.664
Let's talk upstairs.

19:37.547 --> 19:40.148
Hey.

19:40.183 --> 19:42.417
I really didn't like your
attitude this morning.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.186
What was I thinking?

19:44.220 --> 19:46.121
This is about Mads, isn't it?

19:46.155 --> 19:48.423
Hmm? I saw the two of
you talking at church.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.159
What have I told you about
getting involved with her?

19:51.194 --> 19:52.361
Well, I don't take orders from you anymore.

19:52.395 --> 19:56.031
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

19:56.065 --> 19:57.299
Look, I care about her, all right?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.101
So she deserves to know the truth.

19:59.135 --> 20:01.003
So I'm gonna tell her about L.A.

20:01.037 --> 20:03.906
- and how you will never let me forget it.
- I see.

20:05.842 --> 20:08.076
Are you gonna tell her about Flagstaff?

20:08.111 --> 20:10.879
And that call you made to frame Alec?

20:10.914 --> 20:12.714
That was your idea.

20:12.749 --> 20:13.949
Yeah, and you screwed it up.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.017
And now he's out free.

20:15.051 --> 20:17.619
Do you really think Mads

20:17.654 --> 20:18.887
is gonna understand when she learns

20:18.922 --> 20:20.856
that you framed her own father?

20:20.890 --> 20:23.659
You tell her.

20:23.693 --> 20:27.429
I just think if you want
to tell her the truth,

20:27.463 --> 20:28.697
she should probably know everything.

20:28.731 --> 20:30.732
Don't you?

20:34.837 --> 20:37.439
<i>ETHAN: And Dan thinks Theresa</i>

20:37.473 --> 20:39.274
went to the cemetery last night

20:39.309 --> 20:41.543
to find the person leaving the flowers.

20:41.578 --> 20:45.380
A killer with a guilty conscience.

20:48.184 --> 20:49.217
What?

20:49.252 --> 20:52.287
Nothing, it's... nothing.

20:52.322 --> 20:53.255
All right, screw it.

20:53.289 --> 20:55.090
We need to come clean

20:55.124 --> 20:57.159
with Dan right now, just... 
we need to tell him everything.

20:57.193 --> 20:59.127
- We can't do that.
- Emma, come on.

20:59.162 --> 21:00.996
If Dan knows what's going on,

21:01.030 --> 21:03.932
all of your suspicions about
Rebecca and the twin secret,

21:03.967 --> 21:05.901
it might help him find Theresa.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.235
You can't tell him anything... if Dan knows

21:07.270 --> 21:09.204
about the twins, he
might be in danger, too.

21:09.238 --> 21:10.772
He's a cop! He can handle it.

21:10.807 --> 21:12.741
- We just need a little time.
- For what?

21:12.775 --> 21:14.076
All right, enough of this crap.

21:14.110 --> 21:15.777
You guys tell me what's going on.

21:15.812 --> 21:17.813
Ethan, you just have to trust me.

21:17.847 --> 21:19.815
- You're not trusting me.
- Okay, okay,

21:19.849 --> 21:20.983
we've said all we're gonna say.

21:21.017 --> 21:23.051
You should go now.

21:24.787 --> 21:26.688
Yeah.

21:26.723 --> 21:27.990
Whatever.

21:34.664 --> 21:35.897
(door closes)

21:35.932 --> 21:38.634
You think he'll keep quiet?

21:38.668 --> 21:40.802
I hope so.

21:42.772 --> 21:44.706
(siren wailing)

21:50.513 --> 21:52.180
Hey. You okay?

21:52.215 --> 21:53.215
I just got reprimanded.

21:53.249 --> 21:55.417
For what happened with Alec?

21:55.451 --> 21:58.120
What was that about anyway, man?

21:59.155 --> 22:01.156
Alec, uh... 

22:01.190 --> 22:03.291
told Theresa a secret when she was

22:03.326 --> 22:05.093
- his lawyer.
- A secret?

22:05.128 --> 22:06.395
Said it was a family matter.

22:06.429 --> 22:09.965
And, you know, I... I feel
like if I knew what that was,

22:09.999 --> 22:12.901
all of this would make a
hell of a lot more sense.

22:12.935 --> 22:14.102
So what are you gonna do?

22:14.137 --> 22:15.971
Supposed to stay out of it.

22:16.005 --> 22:17.039
Captain's orders.

22:17.073 --> 22:18.840
Yeah, but you're not going to.

22:18.875 --> 22:21.043
No. I'm not.

22:21.077 --> 22:23.145
Starting right now.

22:23.179 --> 22:25.113
What?

22:26.149 --> 22:27.816
What do you know?

22:27.850 --> 22:29.084
Why would I know something?

22:29.118 --> 22:30.686
Don't play dumb with me right now.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.653
You and your friends

22:31.688 --> 22:32.788
were helping out with the case

22:32.822 --> 22:33.889
when I arrested Alec.

22:33.923 --> 22:35.791
Are you protecting Sutton?

22:35.825 --> 22:37.693
Does she have something to do with this?

22:37.727 --> 22:39.561
No.

22:39.595 --> 22:41.496
I swear, I have told you everything.

22:43.466 --> 22:44.733
I really hope so.

22:44.767 --> 22:47.569
I really do.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.442
(sighs)

22:53.476 --> 22:55.410
Okay, this is just not good timing.

22:55.445 --> 22:57.279
I want to call a truce, Emma.

22:57.313 --> 22:58.647
Really?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.482
And why should I believe you?

23:00.516 --> 23:03.285
Because I want answers
just as badly as you do.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.189
So I'm gonna be honest.

23:07.223 --> 23:08.323
You're right.

23:08.357 --> 23:10.125
Rebecca and I have been working together

23:10.159 --> 23:12.260
ever since the night I went into the lake.

23:12.295 --> 23:13.395
I knew it.

23:13.429 --> 23:15.297
So she knows we're twins?

23:15.331 --> 23:18.200
I'm pretty sure she's known
since the delivery room.

23:19.869 --> 23:21.903
Why would she tell you and not me?

23:21.938 --> 23:24.039
She says she wanted to tell you eventually

23:24.073 --> 23:25.173
but wanted to wait... 

23:25.208 --> 23:29.811
It's all part of her
master plan to get Ted back.

23:29.846 --> 23:31.847
She says she still loves him.

23:31.881 --> 23:33.815
Oh, my God. And you just went along with it

23:33.850 --> 23:34.816
behind my back?

23:35.985 --> 23:37.753
I did.

23:37.787 --> 23:38.954
Yeah.

23:38.988 --> 23:41.957
And I know it was selfish, but... 

23:41.991 --> 23:43.692
(scoffs)

23:43.726 --> 23:46.461
I've been looking so long for her,

23:46.496 --> 23:48.396
and then things got bad

23:48.431 --> 23:50.632
between you and me. I just... I didn't... 

23:50.666 --> 23:52.534
I didn't want to share her.

23:52.568 --> 23:55.470
So, why the sudden change of heart?

23:55.505 --> 23:57.272
Because I started to realize

23:57.306 --> 23:59.274
she's not the mother I thought she was.

23:59.308 --> 24:01.543
She's lying to me, too, Emma.

24:01.577 --> 24:03.512
You just... you have to believe me.

24:03.546 --> 24:05.347
I never meant to hurt anybody.

24:05.381 --> 24:07.516
In fact, I called Theresa last night

24:07.550 --> 24:10.352
to arrange a meeting to
just tell her everything.

24:10.386 --> 24:11.486
She just didn't show.

24:11.521 --> 24:13.088
What time last night?

24:13.122 --> 24:14.222
11 o'clock.

24:16.425 --> 24:18.126
Well, Rebecca... 

24:18.161 --> 24:20.362
must have found out
you were gonna bust her,

24:20.396 --> 24:22.197
and... and she... 

24:22.231 --> 24:23.999
went after Theresa.

24:24.033 --> 24:25.133
Maybe, but... 

24:25.168 --> 24:27.035
Rebecca claims she didn't do it,

24:27.069 --> 24:28.303
which is why you and I

24:28.337 --> 24:30.038
need to work together.

24:30.072 --> 24:32.007
We just... we need to share information,

24:32.041 --> 24:33.942
be a team.

24:36.212 --> 24:38.780
No, Sutton.

24:38.815 --> 24:40.015
No.

24:40.049 --> 24:41.983
Come on, Emma, we're sisters.

24:42.018 --> 24:43.885
Don't you think it's a little late

24:43.920 --> 24:45.554
to be playing that card?

24:46.823 --> 24:48.857
You need to leave.

24:48.891 --> 24:50.759
Interesting.

24:51.894 --> 24:53.829
You're not telling me what you know,

24:53.863 --> 24:56.431
which can only mean one thing.

24:56.465 --> 24:57.732
What are you hiding, Emma?

25:09.269 --> 25:11.370
Is your offer still good?

25:11.404 --> 25:13.272
To help with Rebecca?

25:15.308 --> 25:16.275
I can't... 

25:16.309 --> 25:17.409
live like this anymore.

25:17.443 --> 25:19.378
Well, that depends... 

25:20.413 --> 25:22.414
on what your intentions are.

25:22.448 --> 25:25.250
Is this just about Rebecca
or is this about Maddie?

25:25.285 --> 25:27.386
Well, as long as Rebecca keeps making me do

25:27.420 --> 25:28.987
all this crazy crap,

25:29.022 --> 25:30.923
Mads will never give me another chance.

25:32.025 --> 25:32.991
So,

25:33.026 --> 25:34.860
yeah.

25:34.894 --> 25:35.961
Yeah, it is.

25:35.995 --> 25:37.863
If I help you

25:37.897 --> 25:39.131
and you hurt Maddie... 

25:39.165 --> 25:40.899
I wouldn't.

25:40.934 --> 25:42.067
Trust me, she's... 

25:42.101 --> 25:44.670
all I ever think about anymore.

25:44.704 --> 25:46.872
It's why I came to you, 'cause
I don't want to lose her.

25:48.541 --> 25:50.576
All right.

25:50.610 --> 25:51.910
You have a deal.

25:53.513 --> 25:54.646
I help you,

25:54.681 --> 25:56.515
you help me.

25:56.549 --> 25:58.383
What do you want me to do?

26:00.553 --> 26:01.587
Nothing.

26:01.621 --> 26:04.456
Just what you've been doing.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.692
Whatever Rebecca asks you to do.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.500
<i>EMMA: Hey,</i>

26:15.535 --> 26:16.568
have you seen Mom?

26:16.603 --> 26:18.337
Uh, ran off to her salon.

26:18.371 --> 26:19.338
Right after mentioning

26:19.372 --> 26:21.039
she was going to dinner tonight.

26:21.074 --> 26:22.074
With Alec?

26:22.108 --> 26:23.442
Survey says ding, ding, ding.

26:23.476 --> 26:25.410
Wow. She doesn't waste any time.

26:25.445 --> 26:27.245
Well, Dad cheated on her

26:27.280 --> 26:29.147
and stole from her and lied to her.

26:29.182 --> 26:31.183
You don't exactly seem to be

26:31.217 --> 26:32.150
on Team Dad right now,

26:32.185 --> 26:34.953
so how about I just go
to dinner alone with him?

26:34.988 --> 26:36.221
I have things I need to
talk to him about anyway.

26:36.255 --> 26:38.190
Like how he's really your birth father?

26:39.892 --> 26:42.094
I did the math.

26:42.128 --> 26:44.062
She's your mother, they had an affair... 

26:44.097 --> 26:45.797
you must've figured this out.

26:45.832 --> 26:46.765
Yeah.

26:46.799 --> 26:48.667
I did.

26:48.701 --> 26:51.536
I'm just not quite sure
how I feel about it yet.

26:52.605 --> 26:53.705
Me neither.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.607
I mean, he has to know.

26:55.642 --> 26:56.875
Right?

26:56.909 --> 26:59.745
Somehow he ends up
adopting his own daughter?

26:59.779 --> 27:01.647
That can't be a coincidence.

27:01.681 --> 27:03.815
Do you think he knows about you two?

27:03.850 --> 27:06.418
I don't think so.

27:06.452 --> 27:07.586
Either way,

27:07.620 --> 27:09.521
he's been deceiving Mom

27:09.555 --> 27:11.690
and all of us for the last 17 years.

27:11.724 --> 27:13.458
It doesn't get much worse than that.

27:14.694 --> 27:16.495
I hope not.

27:18.364 --> 27:20.198
Is there something else?

27:22.201 --> 27:24.236
It's just that I've been
searching for answers

27:24.270 --> 27:26.238
about my birth parents for so long now,

27:26.272 --> 27:28.407
and I finally have them, and I'm... 

27:28.441 --> 27:32.110
kind of sorry I started
asking the questions

27:32.145 --> 27:33.345
in the first place.

27:34.981 --> 27:36.281
Well... 

27:36.315 --> 27:38.817
I'm not.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.821
You're my half-sister, Emma.

27:42.855 --> 27:44.823
And despite it all, if you and Sutton

27:44.857 --> 27:47.859
hadn't been asking those questions... 

27:47.894 --> 27:50.028
we never would've found each other.

28:01.841 --> 28:03.709
What do you want, Sutton?

28:03.743 --> 28:04.776
The truth.

28:04.811 --> 28:07.512
That's ironic.

28:07.547 --> 28:09.948
All right, I deserve that.

28:09.982 --> 28:10.949
Listen.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.784
I think Emma knows

28:12.819 --> 28:14.586
something about Theresa's disappearance

28:14.620 --> 28:15.754
and Derek's murder,

28:15.788 --> 28:17.723
and she won't tell me what it is.

28:17.757 --> 28:20.459
If you think I know
something, you're wrong.

28:20.493 --> 28:21.493
I don't.

28:23.496 --> 28:25.464
Keeping you out of it, huh?

28:25.498 --> 28:27.299
That's a switch.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.567
I thought they only lied to me.

28:28.601 --> 28:31.470
Look. I want to help you and Dan.

28:31.504 --> 28:35.207
I feel terrible about
what happened with Theresa,

28:35.241 --> 28:38.110
and honestly I don't understand it.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.347
All right, look.

28:42.381 --> 28:46.284
Dan and Theresa found
$20,000 at Derek's house.

28:46.319 --> 28:48.320
We think someone was
paying him to keep quiet

28:48.354 --> 28:49.988
about you and Emma,

28:50.022 --> 28:51.423
and that's what got him killed.

28:51.457 --> 28:54.926
You mean, you thought Rebecca killed him.

28:54.961 --> 28:56.962
That I know.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.196
The Flipside Formal... 

28:58.231 --> 29:00.098
Yeah, that's where it all changed.

29:00.133 --> 29:01.199
All of a sudden,

29:01.234 --> 29:03.135
Emma just drops her suspicions.

29:03.169 --> 29:04.903
And every time I bring it up,

29:04.937 --> 29:06.138
she and Thayer just shut me down.

29:06.172 --> 29:08.940
There has to be a way we can find out.

29:12.044 --> 29:13.845
Maybe there is.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.813
I got to run.

29:14.847 --> 29:15.914
Ethan... 

29:15.948 --> 29:17.816
Come on, what is it? Tell me.

29:17.850 --> 29:18.817
(engine starts)

29:18.851 --> 29:19.851
Ethan!

29:25.625 --> 29:27.559
You look nice.

29:27.593 --> 29:29.795
Hey.

29:29.829 --> 29:32.998
Thanks. I'm going out to
have dinner with a friend.

29:33.032 --> 29:35.600
Kristin Mercer?

29:35.635 --> 29:36.701
Yes.

29:36.736 --> 29:38.703
I heard you might be seeing her.

29:40.573 --> 29:41.740
So... 

29:41.774 --> 29:43.575
what about Rebecca?

29:43.609 --> 29:45.744
We're still working things out.

29:45.778 --> 29:47.412
I... 

29:49.549 --> 29:51.483
I think maybe you should divorce her.

29:51.517 --> 29:55.320
I mean, who knows what
she's capable of and what...

29:55.354 --> 29:57.422
she and Jordan have going on together?

29:57.456 --> 29:59.457
It's all starting to get me pretty worried.

29:59.492 --> 30:01.326
Honey, let me do the worrying, okay?

30:01.360 --> 30:03.461
- I can handle Rebecca.
- Okay.

30:03.496 --> 30:06.298
Hey, have you talked to Thayer lately?

30:06.332 --> 30:08.366
'Cause

30:08.401 --> 30:10.468
he's still blaming you for everything.

30:10.503 --> 30:12.537
Well, you know, h... he'll come around.

30:12.572 --> 30:17.275
It'll all be really
clear to him really soon.

30:32.191 --> 30:34.826
(whispering): Ethan, what
are you doing here? Come on.

30:34.861 --> 30:35.927
It's Ted, isn't it?

30:35.962 --> 30:39.064
That's who you were covering for.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.799
I talked to J.J.

30:40.833 --> 30:42.167
Applying for a job, my ass.

30:42.201 --> 30:44.002
You wanted to know where Ted was last night

30:44.036 --> 30:45.904
- when Theresa went missing.
- No,

30:45.938 --> 30:48.874
I am concerned about him and Kristin

30:48.908 --> 30:50.675
- and the divorce.
- Stop lying!

30:50.710 --> 30:51.810
You suspect him, don't you?

30:51.844 --> 30:53.011
Would you just keep it down, please?

30:54.947 --> 30:56.781
I think he's innocent. I really do,

30:56.816 --> 30:58.917
but I also know how bad this
looks for him, and that's why... 

30:58.951 --> 31:00.752
we couldn't say anything to anybody.

31:00.786 --> 31:01.887
"We"?

31:01.921 --> 31:02.954
You mean you and Thayer?

31:02.989 --> 31:04.923
Let me guess, this was his idea?

31:04.957 --> 31:08.660
- He's looking out for me, Ethan.
- Or he's trying to drive us apart,

31:08.694 --> 31:10.495
trying to convince you
that I can't be trusted.

31:10.529 --> 31:11.496
Well, then prove him wrong.

31:11.530 --> 31:12.864
If this gets out,

31:12.899 --> 31:15.567
it will ruin my whole family.

31:15.601 --> 31:16.768
What about my family?

31:16.802 --> 31:18.436
What about Dan?

31:19.772 --> 31:23.341
I know this is really
unfair of me to ask of you,

31:23.376 --> 31:24.376
but please... 

31:24.410 --> 31:25.644
don't tell him.

31:25.678 --> 31:28.713
Not until we can prove
that Ted is innocent.

31:28.748 --> 31:30.615
Theresa is missing, okay?

31:30.650 --> 31:32.384
She could be dead.

31:32.418 --> 31:34.185
If Ted is responsible for this... 

31:34.220 --> 31:35.287
I just need time.

31:36.422 --> 31:38.290
Give me one night. Tonight.

31:38.324 --> 31:39.491
Look... 

31:40.526 --> 31:43.128
last night, when you came here,

31:43.162 --> 31:45.997
you said that you and me, we're everything.

31:46.032 --> 31:48.133
If you believe that and if that's true,

31:48.167 --> 31:49.401
you will do this for me.

32:11.187 --> 32:12.154
(door opens)

32:15.492 --> 32:17.393
(quietly): I am not the only one home.

32:17.427 --> 32:18.494
What is it that couldn't wait?

32:18.528 --> 32:20.262
Derek was blackmailing someone

32:20.297 --> 32:21.430
about me and Emma.

32:21.464 --> 32:22.464
Was it you?

32:22.499 --> 32:24.166
No.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.068
How do you know about that?

32:26.102 --> 32:27.069
It doesn't matter.

32:27.103 --> 32:28.070
The point is,

32:28.104 --> 32:29.204
whoever Derek was blackmailing

32:29.239 --> 32:30.973
is probably the person who killed him.

32:31.007 --> 32:33.008
- And Theresa.
- Who told you that?

32:33.043 --> 32:34.843
Hmm? Ethan? Emma?

32:34.878 --> 32:36.979
If it wasn't you, why are you freaking out?

32:37.013 --> 32:38.213
You need to tell me.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.049
Do they know who was being blackmailed?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.784
Do you?

32:41.818 --> 32:42.918
Answer the question.

32:42.952 --> 32:44.186
<i>You answer it.</i>

32:44.220 --> 32:46.722
Forget it. I can find out another way.

32:46.756 --> 32:50.059
I don't understand. Who are you
possibly protecting here? Ted?

32:50.093 --> 32:51.994
That is your father you are talking about.

32:53.129 --> 32:55.698
God, okay. I'm sorry.

33:07.711 --> 33:09.912
Dad, what are you doing?

33:09.946 --> 33:12.781
I thought we were meeting at the club.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.750
Dropped my hospital
key card somewhere. I... 

33:14.784 --> 33:16.618
Do you guys know where it is?

33:16.653 --> 33:19.388
- Did you put it somewhere?
- No.

33:22.592 --> 33:24.360
Listen, about tonight,

33:24.394 --> 33:27.262
I really wanted to talk
to you about some things.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.430
Yeah, no. Great, we'll talk.

33:28.465 --> 33:29.631
I just need to find this damn key card.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.467
Well, did you retrace your steps?

33:31.501 --> 33:33.635
Where was the last place you used it?

33:33.670 --> 33:36.171
Yesterday at the hospital.

33:36.206 --> 33:38.140
And after?

33:38.174 --> 33:40.075
Where were you last night?

33:40.110 --> 33:41.210
Out.

33:41.244 --> 33:43.112
Out where?

33:43.146 --> 33:45.180
Well, what is it with all
these questions, Sutton?

33:45.215 --> 33:47.316
Sorry. I'm just trying to help.

33:47.350 --> 33:50.119
(phone buzzes)

33:55.325 --> 33:57.359
- That son of a bitch.
- KRISTIN: Ted,

33:57.394 --> 34:00.863
how many times do I
have to ask you? Please?

34:00.897 --> 34:02.898
You're going to a hotel with Alec?

34:02.932 --> 34:05.801
That's none of your business.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.936
What are you doing? Are you spying on me?

34:07.971 --> 34:10.773
- You're going to screw him, aren't you?
- EMMA: Oh, my God.

34:10.806 --> 34:11.974
How dare you do this

34:12.007 --> 34:13.876
in front of our daughters!
Have you lost your mind?

34:13.909 --> 34:16.043
- What's going on?
- We're talking about Alec,

34:16.079 --> 34:17.813
the most untrustworthy
bastard on the planet.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.947
Oh, really? 'Cause I
thought that's what you were.

34:23.853 --> 34:24.686
(gasps)

34:25.688 --> 34:26.755
EMMA: Dad?

34:27.791 --> 34:28.924
Get out.

34:28.958 --> 34:32.860
- I'm sorry.
- Get out now before I call the police.

34:34.764 --> 34:36.431
(sighs)

34:36.466 --> 34:38.634
(door closes)

34:42.806 --> 34:45.574
<i>REBECCA: I have a new assignment for you.</i>

34:45.608 --> 34:47.509
Okay.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.679
Well, I've given it some thought, and... 

34:50.713 --> 34:54.550
maybe I was wrong to
keep you and Mads apart.

34:54.583 --> 34:58.420
JORDAN: You... wrong?

34:58.455 --> 34:59.621
Wow. I don't know

34:59.656 --> 35:01.423
if I've ever heard you say that before.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.492
Her friends are looking
into Theresa's disappearance.

35:03.526 --> 35:06.261
I want you to get close to her again

35:06.296 --> 35:07.629
and find out what they know.

35:07.664 --> 35:10.499
JORDAN: You want me to spy on Mads?

35:10.533 --> 35:13.469
I want you to spy on all of
them, and she's your way in.

35:13.503 --> 35:16.338
Then all you have to do
is keep your ears open.

35:16.372 --> 35:18.173
Is that a problem?

35:18.208 --> 35:21.043
No.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.978
Not at all.

35:25.181 --> 35:27.382
Report back to me.

35:38.962 --> 35:40.896
(gasps) What happened?

35:40.930 --> 35:42.965
Did he hurt you?

35:42.999 --> 35:44.199
No. Did he hit you?

35:44.234 --> 35:47.736
No, but... he was so angry.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.906
I just... I've never seen him like that.

35:50.940 --> 35:54.910
(sniffles) If he ever comes near
you again, I want you to call me.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.913
Alec, please. I don't
want to get you involved.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.682
It's... it's... it's
not like I'm in danger.

36:00.717 --> 36:02.751
It's too late. I'm already involved.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.987
Oh, Alec.

36:05.021 --> 36:07.656
I don't think... 

36:07.690 --> 36:09.658
I know.

36:09.692 --> 36:11.760
You're not ready for this.

36:11.794 --> 36:12.961
It's okay.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.631
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

36:15.665 --> 36:17.833
Hey.

36:19.936 --> 36:22.571
It's okay.

36:28.611 --> 36:30.712
It would have been a lovely evening.

36:30.747 --> 36:33.415
It still will be... 

36:33.449 --> 36:35.751
some day.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.658
(door closes)

36:42.692 --> 36:44.760
<i>THAYER: So he just snapped?</i>

36:44.794 --> 36:46.728
It doesn't necessarily
mean he killed anyone.

36:46.763 --> 36:49.464
Well, maybe we should just
give him a chance to cool off.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.699
I don't have time.

36:50.733 --> 36:52.467
Ethan's only giving me until morning.

36:52.502 --> 36:55.304
Wait. You told Ethan about Ted?

36:55.338 --> 36:56.638
He figured it out on his own.

36:56.673 --> 37:00.542
But I got him to stay quiet,
at least until tomorrow.

37:00.577 --> 37:03.211
You got him to stay quiet?

37:03.246 --> 37:04.546
How'd you do that?

37:04.581 --> 37:08.216
I... I asked him.

37:09.319 --> 37:11.486
(sighs)

37:11.521 --> 37:14.389
I still have more time.

37:14.424 --> 37:17.125
- Where are you going?
- To make sure I'm not wrong.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.394
- I'll come with you.
- No. Thayer,

37:19.429 --> 37:22.097
I have to do this alone.

37:46.969 --> 37:49.604
What do you want?

37:49.639 --> 37:51.773
I've just been wondering
where I went wrong with you.

37:59.515 --> 38:01.650
Is that supposed to be funny?

38:01.684 --> 38:03.719
Is that a joke?!

38:03.753 --> 38:08.457
You are a terrible father.

38:08.491 --> 38:10.492
All the stuff you put me through.

38:10.526 --> 38:12.661
You don't know why I do the things I do, T?

38:12.695 --> 38:17.366
Because you blame me, and you hate me.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.700
Because you've always hated me.

38:20.770 --> 38:23.672
And because of Mom... and what happened?

38:23.706 --> 38:26.274
No.

38:26.309 --> 38:28.677
Listen to me.

38:31.414 --> 38:35.150
Whatever happens... 

38:35.184 --> 38:37.119
just know that I've done everything

38:37.153 --> 38:39.554
and will continue to do everything

38:39.589 --> 38:42.224
for you... 

38:42.258 --> 38:44.326
because I love you.

38:45.495 --> 38:47.329
Okay.

39:02.311 --> 39:03.979
Ted?

39:05.915 --> 39:07.983
Oh, my God, what happened?
Are... are you okay?

39:08.017 --> 39:09.851
It's got to be here somewhere.

39:09.886 --> 39:12.020
Ted, calm down.

39:12.054 --> 39:13.955
Talk to me, tell me... 

39:13.990 --> 39:16.057
(sighs)

39:16.092 --> 39:17.859
What's wrong?

39:17.894 --> 39:19.094
Everything's wrong.

39:20.296 --> 39:21.963
Forget it.

39:21.998 --> 39:23.131
You wouldn't understand.

39:23.166 --> 39:26.001
(sighs)

39:26.035 --> 39:27.969
You'd be surprised.

39:28.004 --> 39:29.938
(sighs)

39:29.972 --> 39:32.140
Whatever it is, I'm on your side.

39:32.175 --> 39:33.842
(sighs)

39:33.876 --> 39:36.778
You can trust me... with anything.

39:36.813 --> 39:38.947
(sighs)

39:41.918 --> 39:44.052
I'm sorry, I can't. I have to go.

39:53.729 --> 39:55.897
You got a minute?

39:55.932 --> 39:57.899
No, I don't.

39:59.101 --> 40:01.069
Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you.

40:02.972 --> 40:05.073
And your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.

40:05.107 --> 40:07.843
- Wait. He did?
- Yeah.

40:07.877 --> 40:09.878
And this might sound crazy,

40:09.912 --> 40:12.080
but I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.

40:14.016 --> 40:17.686
So I can finally be free of her.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.054
Jordan.

40:21.791 --> 40:24.025
You need to be careful.

40:24.060 --> 40:26.862
Rebecca might be more
dangerous than even you realize.

40:26.896 --> 40:28.864
I know a lot more than you think.

40:28.898 --> 40:30.665
And not only about Rebecca.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.934
About... Sutton.

40:32.969 --> 40:35.537
And Emma.

40:46.872 --> 40:48.750
- Theresa?
- I already searched it.

40:48.784 --> 40:50.719
She took everything.

40:50.753 --> 40:52.888
Except, this must have
fallen between the seats.

40:52.922 --> 40:54.656
What is it?

40:54.690 --> 40:56.825
I'll give you a minute.

40:59.629 --> 41:01.396
It's her vows.

41:03.733 --> 41:07.836
"I promise, I will always
be by your side, Dan.

41:07.870 --> 41:11.406
You are my soul mate, my lover,

41:11.440 --> 41:14.476
my best friend.

41:16.445 --> 41:18.380
And I can't wait to
begin our life together."

41:22.418 --> 41:24.786
Does that sound like someone
who got cold feet to you?

41:24.820 --> 41:27.822
No, it doesn't.

41:27.857 --> 41:30.559
Someone's trying really hard

41:30.593 --> 41:33.361
to make everyone think that she's left me.

41:34.797 --> 41:37.499
She wouldn't do that.

41:37.533 --> 41:39.334
(sighs)

41:39.368 --> 41:42.537
So where is she?

41:44.707 --> 41:47.509
I don't know.

41:47.543 --> 41:52.414
But when I find the person
who took her from me... 

41:52.448 --> 41:54.616
I'm going to kill him.

41:57.486 --> 41:59.621
(crickets chirping)

42:09.599 --> 42:11.733
(sighs)

42:16.606 --> 42:19.341
(panting)

42:21.744 --> 42:25.413
Looking for this?

42:27.817 --> 42:31.319
My God!

42:31.354 --> 42:32.687
How could you?
