18:15.344 --> 18:16.844
Where's the money?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.722
Not until I know he's okay.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.224
Your mate's hanging in there.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.518
Now where's the money?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.080
It's not here. You can search the
place if you don't believe me.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.359
Where's the money?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.111
Where's Kirby?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.532

romantic dinner, or he shot you.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.803
KRAMER: What? This runt?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.973
He couldn't even pick up a gun,
let alone use it.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.475
If you want a romantic dinner,
you're going about it the wrong way.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:06.395 --> 19:08.479
What have I told you
about them anger issues?

19:10.065 --> 19:12.900
- Count to ten.
- Exactly. Count to ten.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.403
And then if you still want to
smash his skull in, you can.

that we're dealing with now.

He's fucking dead.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.263

I tell you what, if I wasn't talking right
now, I'd be lost for words. You look...

31:13.329 --> 31:15.122
Be nice.
It's our first date.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.623

31:17.166 --> 31:18.333
slutty.

Never put shoes on the table.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.550
Oh.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.219
You don't actually believe in
all that stuff, do you?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.639
I do, yeah.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.686
What is it, cracks in pavement,
hats on beds?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.022
I never want to see
a hat on a bed.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.149
I always have a hat on my bed.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.569
Well, maybe on your bed
it might be okay.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.529
Thanks.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.160
Here's to us.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.666
So who taught you all
these magic tricks?

32:00.251 --> 32:02.336
My best mate taught me.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.339
So you can make things appear?
Anything else?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.383
- I can hypnotise people.
- Ooh.

32:08.509 --> 32:09.949
I can hypnotise you now,
if you want.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.346
- Okay.
- Give me your hands.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.597
Go on, then.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.557
Stare into my eyes.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.603
Give in to my eyes.
Feel yourself tumbling.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.064
Deeper.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.944
And deeper.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.948
Now stand up and
give me a lap dance.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.747
Seriously?

32:38.915 --> 32:40.082
God.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.084

32:45.046 --> 32:48.548

32:58.226 --> 33:00.060
I was the only survivor.

33:00.144 --> 33:04.314
This family read about it
in the papers, adopted me.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.483
They've called me Lucky ever since.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.778
Wow.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.239
I was kind of hoping for
a more upbeat story.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.408

33:15.410 --> 33:16.827

33:20.581 --> 33:22.290
I'm with a beautiful girl.

to go in through the front door.

is the River Thames.

40:04.819 --> 40:05.985

come in from the river.

No, I said, "Let him go."

58:20.622 --> 58:22.122
"Let him go"?

58:22.749 --> 58:24.333
Is it bleeding?

58:25.251 --> 58:27.002
No, but it will be in a minute.

58:37.805 --> 58:41.600
Hi.

58:45.688 --> 58:48.273
Why can't it still
be dark outside?

58:49.317 --> 58:50.442
No.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.153
You're not going to
see my face this time.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.949
I want to see your
face all the time.

58:59.953 --> 59:03.038
I want you to come
and surprise me more often.

59:04.832 --> 59:06.667

- Really.

What are you thinking?

59:22.976 --> 59:24.560
I'm thinking

59:25.812 --> 59:27.646
I need to leave

59:28.815 --> 59:30.065
home.

59:31.818 --> 59:34.069
I have to get away from Nikila,

59:34.571 --> 59:36.321
start a new life.

59:37.323 --> 59:39.491
Can't be near him any more.

59:40.827 --> 59:42.411
What are you thinking?

59:43.413 --> 59:45.831

a lot better with you in it.

they know where I live.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:07.102
I don't want you being here
if they come back.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:10.856
Yeah.

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:13.692
Okay.

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:16.361
I'll wait.

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:21.950
Fuck!

Can't we just wait
till he gets here?

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.125
He'll just hand them over, huh?

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.046
Go to the boxing gym.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.964
Why? Where you going?

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.591

You knew about the bonds.

Still can't kid my kid brother.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.659
We've got 140 in cash between us,

That's Dragan Zigic.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:33.522
He deals with money laundering, protection
rackets, gambling, prostitution.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.108
Sounds lovely. Let's have him round
for some tea and cake sometime.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.360
Can we go and sort the bonds first?

01:01:38.444 --> 01:01:40.445
He also owns the casino.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.115
Right.
So, not the Stocks Brothers?

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.950
No. I lied.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.969
They did what?

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.805
Niko and Eli,

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.559
they killed Mum and Dad.
They burnt them alive.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.312
It's true.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:18.650
They're collectors for Zigic.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.028
You know what Dad was like.
He didn't pay.

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.656
They burnt their restaurant down.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.410

Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:31.163
Because you would have
tried to stop me.

I've spent the last year of my life
and everything I have planning this.

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:35.041
They have to pay.

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.261
- These two work for him as well?
- Right-hand men.

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.638
If you've been tracking Zigic,
you knew he owned

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.056
the club that Kirby robbed.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.128
Why didn't you warn him?

01:02:51.154 --> 01:02:53.210
I didn't know he was
going to rob the place.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:55.312
Of course you did.
He couldn't keep a secret.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.358
- He's dead because of you.
- Really?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.694
You were his hotshot getaway driver!

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.154

In a couple of days, I'll let Zigic know
where he can find his bearer bonds.

It'll all be on Niko and Eli,
and they'll be minced meat.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.304
I stole Eli's car and planted
the bonds in the boot.

They're in a safe place,
so don't worry about it.
