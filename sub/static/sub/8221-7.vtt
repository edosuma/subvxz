 at home.

00:03.770 --> 00:06.770
 Ever!

00:08.007 --> 00:10.976
 NARRATOR: On this invigorating
 episode of "Mythbusters,"

00:10.977 --> 00:13.977
 we're turning the heat
 on three frosty Alaskan fables.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.051
 This is perfect
 for an Alaska adventure.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.285
 NARRATOR:
 Adam and Jamie prove

00:20.286 --> 00:23.122
 this is no country
 for cold men...

00:23.123 --> 00:25.991
 Oh, great.
 We got a yeti outside.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.527
 NARRATOR:... as cabin fever
 takes its toll.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.528
 I've just had the worst night of
 sleep I've ever had in my life.

00:31.998 --> 00:34.566
 NARRATOR: Tory, Grant, and Kari
 see if hitting the gas

00:34.567 --> 00:37.567
 might lessen the damage caused
 by Alaska's scariest roadkill.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.641
 And we'll see
 if a dynamite-toting dog

00:42.642 --> 00:45.642
 really could devastate a drunken
 duck hunter's brand-new S. U.V.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.214
 Bye-bye.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.820
 NARRATOR:
 Who are the Mythbusters?

00:54.821 --> 00:57.821
 Did you know what was lurking
 in your basement?

00:57.824 --> 00:58.924
 NARRATOR:
 Adam Savage...

 I am the fire ninja!

01:01.061 --> 01:03.362
 NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.396
 Is that beautiful, or what?

 [ Grunts ]

01:05.432 --> 01:07.666
 NARRATOR: Between them,

01:07.667 --> 01:09.401
 of special-effects experience.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.569

 [ Elevator dings ]

01:22.415 --> 01:24.283
 NARRATOR:
 They don't just tell the myths.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.284
 They put them to the test.

 It's really cold here,
 but it's also really beautiful.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.469
 This place has
 a mythology all its own.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.738
 So we've got a full hour
 of Alaska myths.

01:50.143 --> 01:53.143
 NARRATOR: Tourism types up here
 market the 49th state

01:53.279 --> 01:55.948
 as the land of intensity.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.183
 It's twice the size of Texas,

01:58.184 --> 02:01.184
 so we figure
 it's big and intense enough

02:01.921 --> 02:04.921
 to handle
 some high-impact mythbusting.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.926
 [ Dog barks ]

02:07.927 --> 02:09.527
 Like most of our favorite myths,

02:09.529 --> 02:12.529
 this one involves some
 drunken friends and explosives.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.832
 You got a group
 of drunken friends,

02:13.833 --> 02:16.168
 one of whom's just
 bought a brand-new S. U.V.,

02:16.169 --> 02:17.469
 and they all decide

02:17.470 --> 02:19.538
 that they want to go
 duck hunting with their dog,

02:19.539 --> 02:21.974
 except there's nothing around
 them but a frozen lake,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.742
 and no duck is gonna land
 on a frozen lake.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.310
 So they need to make a hole.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.080
 One of them offers up a stick of
 dynamite with a 20-second fuse

02:28.081 --> 02:29.381
 to make a big hole

02:29.382 --> 02:31.850
 and throws that stick
 of dynamite as hard as he can.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.218
 I can see what's coming.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.220
 The dog,
 following its natural impulses,

02:35.221 --> 02:37.456
 chases after that
 stick of dynamite, catches it,

02:37.457 --> 02:39.258
 starts ferrying it
 back to the guy,

02:39.259 --> 02:41.460
 under the brand-new S. U.V.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.161
 Uh-oh!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.162
 The dog, the dynamite,
 and the S. U.V. go boom!

02:45.565 --> 02:47.833
 The S. U.V. goes
 down to the bottom of the lake,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.834
 and the guy who owned it
 is still making payments.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.605
 NARRATOR:
 This not-so-urban myth

02:53.606 --> 02:56.606
 surely stretches the bounds
 of human stupidity.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.077
 My sympathies are all
 with the dog,

02:59.078 --> 03:02.078
 though you must admit
 it's as funny as hell.

03:03.383 --> 03:06.383
 But maybe it's too funny
 to be true.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.586
 As Jamie and Adam set off
 to find their frozen lake,

03:09.722 --> 03:12.357
 it's worth noting
 that this folktale

03:12.358 --> 03:15.358
 is almost as old
 as dynamite itself.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.633
 ADAM: The first thing
 we obviously needed

03:21.634 --> 03:23.268
 was a frozen lake.

03:23.269 --> 03:25.404
 And the researchers found us
 one here in Alaska.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.506
 Behind me,
 this snowfield you see

03:27.507 --> 03:30.442
 is, in fact, Fischer Pond,
 a man-made lake,

03:30.443 --> 03:32.844
 which means there are no fish
 for us to kill,

03:32.845 --> 03:35.845
 with a nice coating
 of rock-hard ice on top.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.251
 NARRATOR: The ice on the pond
 is too thick to dig through,

03:39.252 --> 03:41.653
 and that supports the myth.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.654
 But can it support
 a 2-ton truck?

03:45.258 --> 03:47.092
 Okay, here we go.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.861
 NARRATOR: Orson Smith
 and his fancy ice drill

03:49.862 --> 03:52.064
 should give us a quick answer.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.333
 Fans of slapstick
 should appreciate

03:54.334 --> 03:56.535
 the [Laughs]
 breakthrough moment.

03:56.536 --> 03:57.302
 ADAM: Whoa!

03:57.303 --> 03:59.137
 SMITH:
 That's a hell of a thing.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.138
 NARRATOR: The ice core cracks up
 as it's bashed loose.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.109
 SMITH:
 Look at that!

04:04.110 --> 04:07.110
 NARRATOR: Put back together,
 it's a foot and a half thick.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.781
 So, it's got vertical crystals

04:09.782 --> 04:12.317
 that make it really stronger
 than average.

04:12.318 --> 04:15.318
 So it's safe for us to drive
 our S. U.V. out here?

04:15.588 --> 04:16.588
 Yes.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.589
 ADAM: Look, this story has
 a ton of components to it,

04:19.959 --> 04:21.426
 and the first part of it is,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.395
 how far can you throw
 a stick of dynamite?

04:23.396 --> 04:25.597
 Remember, kids,
 this isn't real dynamite.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.433
 We would never throw
 real dynamite,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.302
 and neither should you.

04:30.303 --> 04:33.303
 All right, Jamie. I want you
 to put your chi into this thing.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.742
 That's it!

04:36.743 --> 04:38.877
 Go!

04:38.878 --> 04:39.411
 Nice!

04:39.412 --> 04:42.412
 NARRATOR: Jamie's toss is
 up over the 1 00-foot mark.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.949
 Now it's Adam's chance

04:43.950 --> 04:46.950
 to prove he's got the mojo
 of the throw, Joe.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.055
 [ Laughter ]

04:50.056 --> 04:52.291
 Those look to be about the same.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.993
 NARRATOR:
 Two hefty, manly throws

04:54.994 --> 04:57.596
 with an average distance of...

04:57.597 --> 05:00.332
 125 feet.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.333
 NARRATOR:
 Okay, time to bring out the dog.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.772
 The myth is about a black lab

05:06.773 --> 05:08.807
 that retrieves
 a stick of dynamite.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.676
 That's what Rudy is.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.711
 As you can see,
 he's raring to go.

05:12.712 --> 05:15.414
 He really wants to retrieve
 that stick of dynamite.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.415
 NARRATOR: And has no idea
 what he's signed up for.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.252
 Now we've got to get
 another myth started.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.329
 [ Moose bellows ]

05:32.799 --> 05:35.600
 KARI: Okay, so,
 we're in Alaska in the snow.

05:35.601 --> 05:36.935
 What myth did we get?

05:36.936 --> 05:38.937
 Okay, well, this is
 a fairly gory myth

05:38.938 --> 05:41.938
 that affects a lot of Alaskans,
 but not so many in California.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.041
 What's that?

05:43.042 --> 05:45.110
 It's about the moose
 and what happens

05:45.111 --> 05:48.111
 when you hit one with your car.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.550
 NARRATOR: This is what happens
 when moose meets motorcar,

05:54.387 --> 05:57.387
 and it's all too common
 here in Alaska.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.093
 A low-speed collision
 most often ends

06:01.094 --> 06:04.094
 with something bigger
 and heavier than a fridge

06:04.163 --> 06:06.465
 coming right through
 your windshield.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.466
 The myth says that speeding up
 instead of slowing down

06:10.970 --> 06:13.970
 might push the unlucky beast
 over the car,

06:14.273 --> 06:17.242
 meaning you might live
 to tell the tale.

06:17.243 --> 06:19.511
 Well, obviously we're not gonna
 kill a real moose

06:19.512 --> 06:21.012
 -to test this myth, right?
 -Right.

06:21.013 --> 06:24.013
 Yeah. We're gonna have to make
 our own moose analogue.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.584
 NARRATOR:
 They'll also have to wrangle

06:25.585 --> 06:28.585
 a bunch of stunt cars
 and a safe test venue.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.988
 But those are problems
 for tomorrow.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.993
 Right now, they need
 to design a moose

06:34.994 --> 06:37.994
 that can bounce back
 from something like this.

06:39.532 --> 06:40.565
 Oh [bleep]

06:40.566 --> 06:42.501
 Have either of you
 ever seen a real moose?

06:42.502 --> 06:44.002
 -No.
 -I don't think so.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.804
 Maybe we should try to find
 a real moose.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.606
 That way, we can make
 our crash-test moose

06:47.607 --> 06:49.341
 as close to a real one
 as we can.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.342
 NARRATOR: These California kids
 have never seen a wild moose,

06:53.179 --> 06:56.179
 but they've had a tip-off
 from Alaska Fish & Game

06:56.516 --> 06:59.516
 to search no further
 than downtown Anchorage.

07:00.686 --> 07:01.787
 GRANT: Whoa.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.355
 TORY:
 That's a big one.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.356
 NARRATOR: This 1 ,200-pound bull
 named Buzzwinkle

07:06.759 --> 07:09.759
 is loitering by a two-story bar
 called Ernie's Bungalow.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.532
 I'm not sure what's weirder --

07:13.533 --> 07:16.435
 that the moose is in the middle
 of downtown at a bar

07:16.436 --> 07:18.770
 or that it's only like 1 :30.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.771
 KARI: The legs end
 right about where the hood is,

07:21.874 --> 07:23.275
 like right where you'd hit.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.644
 -[ Laughs ]
 -No way.

07:25.645 --> 07:28.313
 Look.
 He's going to the mall.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.448
 NARRATOR:
 This mature bull

07:29.449 --> 07:32.250
 looks about 6 foot tall
 at the shoulder,

07:32.251 --> 07:34.653
 but they'll need to get
 much closer

07:34.654 --> 07:36.288
 to take accurate measurements

07:36.289 --> 07:39.289
 for a crash-test
 moose simulator.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.960
 Cue the Alaskan Wildlife
 Conservation Center.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.197
 Out here, moose are accustomed
 to the ways of men.

 Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:50.002 --> 07:52.070
 [ Laughs ]
 He's stabbing me!

07:52.071 --> 07:54.239
 NARRATOR:
 Well, most men.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.240
 Let's say we make this moose
 dummy out of ballistics gel.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.946
 If we hit that with a car,
 it's just gonna explode.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.281
 -Yeah.
 -So we need to get a feeling

08:03.282 --> 08:06.282
 for, you know,
 what it feels like.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.987
 KARI: Well, this is definitely
 not a ballistics gel.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.356
 -TORY: No.
 -GRANT: Is he firm or squishy?

08:11.357 --> 08:12.724
 TORY:
 He's pretty solid.

08:12.725 --> 08:15.293
 I mean, it's like there's hardly
 any fat on him at all.

08:15.294 --> 08:18.294
 He's got sort of like
 the durometer of, like, rubber.

08:18.531 --> 08:19.831
 Really dense rubber.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.667
 -GRANT: Really?
 -TORY: Yeah.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.668
 NARRATOR: Seems we need to make
 a very dense rubber replica.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.440
 And that's something the team
 can't do here in Anchorage.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.010
 KARI:
 We don't even know remotely

08:33.011 --> 08:34.913
 how we're gonna get
 all of that weight

08:34.914 --> 08:36.715
 up onto
 such spindly, little legs,

08:36.716 --> 08:39.716
 so it's gonna take
 some planning, a lot of effort,

08:39.751 --> 08:42.751
 and we need the tools
 back in San Francisco.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.323
 NARRATOR: Alaska really is
 a land of intensity --

08:47.693 --> 08:50.693
 the wilderness, the wildlife,
 and the winters.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.465
 It's those short, cold days

08:53.466 --> 08:56.466
 that make this state home
 to an all-time classic myth.

08:59.739 --> 09:00.605
 What do we got?

09:00.606 --> 09:03.606
 Well, you know, winters
 in Alaska are pretty harsh.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.711
 The days are short.
 The nights are real long.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.847
 People get snowed in
 with nothing to do,

09:08.848 --> 09:10.248
 and supposedly, they succumb

09:10.249 --> 09:13.218
 to a condition
 known as cabin fever.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.353
 You mean they get, like,
 all loopy?

09:15.354 --> 09:18.354
 Exactly, and, well,
 we're gonna put it to the test.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.225
 Well, you're already
 a little nuts.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.726
 How are we gonna tell
 the difference?

09:21.727 --> 09:23.028
 Actually, it turns out

09:23.029 --> 09:26.029
 that there are a distinct set
 of symptoms to cabin fever.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.332
 All we got to do

09:27.333 --> 09:29.334
 is put ourselves
 in the right conditions

09:29.335 --> 09:32.137
 and see if we exhibit
 those symptoms.

09:32.138 --> 09:35.138
 NARRATOR: Kari delayed her
 flight back to sunny San Fran

09:35.374 --> 09:38.374
 to act as the moderator
 of mental health.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.912
 KARI:
 I found the perfect location

09:40.913 --> 09:42.948
 to test cabin fever
 on Jamie and Adam --

09:42.949 --> 09:45.949
 Hatcher's Pass Lodge in Alaska,
 far from anything.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.455
 NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie are
 just minutes away

09:50.456 --> 09:53.456
 from a stint in solitary and
 a possible descent into madness.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.496
 It's tiny,
 it's in the middle of nowhere,

09:58.497 --> 10:00.865
 and you can barely see
 out the windows, it's so white.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.067
 NARRATOR:
 They'll spend their time

10:02.068 --> 10:04.469
 just hanging out
 in adjacent huts.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.470
 A sudden flurry of snow
 sets the scene.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.040
 This is perfect
 for an Alaska adventure.

10:11.744 --> 10:12.744
 Hi, Kari.

10:12.745 --> 10:13.845
 Hi, guys.

10:13.846 --> 10:14.779
 How are you?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.715
 You can barely see anything.

10:16.716 --> 10:17.716
 Hey.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.418
 It's about to get dark.

10:20.419 --> 10:21.853
 There's a snowstorm.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.488
 Are you ready
 to get cabin fever?

10:23.489 --> 10:24.756
 I'm ready.
 You ready?

10:24.757 --> 10:25.991
 Yeah, let's go.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.692
 Wait till I show you
 to your room.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.227
 NARRATOR:
 The rooms aren't bad.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.929
 [ Laughs ]

10:30.930 --> 10:33.930
 But they've both been stripped
 back to bare essentials --

10:34.433 --> 10:35.767
 as are the boys.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.069
 They're well-searched
 for anything

10:38.070 --> 10:40.372
 that might divert or entertain.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.373
 So, hope you have no other
 contraband, no electronics.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.011
 -I need your watch as well.
 -Oh, okay.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.380
 I have no electronics,
 no reading material.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.949
 Uh, that's my watch.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.051
 NARRATOR:
 Both of our detainees

10:53.052 --> 10:55.053
 think this will be
 a walk in the park.

10:55.054 --> 10:58.054
 And let's remember that Jamie's
 already spent quality time

10:58.858 --> 11:00.325
 inside a coffin.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.594
 And he's still alive.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.595
 NARRATOR: But they're not
 so sure about each other.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.698
 Um... whether Adam is gonna deal
 with this real well,

11:10.903 --> 11:11.936
 I don't know.

11:11.937 --> 11:14.937
 Adam's a little, um, impulsive.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.808
 Ah!

11:16.809 --> 11:19.809
 NARRATOR: Only a friend
 could put it so gently.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.080
 Aaah!

11:22.081 --> 11:24.783
 He could just, like,
 get a bug up his butt

11:24.784 --> 11:26.284
 and go nuts for all I know.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.919
 I don't really know.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.920
 NARRATOR: And right back at you
 from cellblock one, good buddy.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.825
 Oh, I think Jamie will be
 painting on the walls

11:33.826 --> 11:36.826
 in his own blood
 inside of 46 hours.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.163
 [ Laughs ]

11:38.164 --> 11:40.732
 NARRATOR: Well, that should add
 some color.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.801
 But let's spare
 a thought for Kari.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.802
 She has to watch these two
 slowly unravel.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.907
 This is my Big-Sister
 surveillance system.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.241
 I've got four cameras --

11:50.242 --> 11:52.377
 one in the front and back
 of each cabin.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.378
 I can switch between the cameras
 with a touch of a button

11:55.981 --> 11:57.849
 and watch their every move.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.451
 NARRATOR:
 Surveillance aside,

11:59.452 --> 12:02.452
 Kari's running cognitive
 and stress tests

12:02.555 --> 12:04.389
 to get some hard data.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.390
 But our volunteer voyeur
 has her own troubles.

12:08.127 --> 12:11.127
 I think I'm gonna go crazy
 before they are.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.965
 Did I mention we're in the same
 circumstance that they are,

12:13.966 --> 12:16.901
 except for I have to watch them
 be bored?

12:16.902 --> 12:19.003
 NARRATOR: Jamie at least
 has a simple plan

12:19.004 --> 12:21.005
 to preserve his sanity.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.774
 JAMIE:
 I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.310
 Every day's gonna be working out
 until I'm exhausted,

12:25.311 --> 12:26.778
 and then I'm gonna sleep.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.779
 NARRATOR: The man with
 the mustache kicks off in style,

12:29.815 --> 12:31.950
 but the short days
 and long nights

12:31.951 --> 12:34.951
 might soon sap his spirit.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.822
 So, who's going to crack first?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.824
 Adam?

12:39.825 --> 12:41.292
 Jamie?

12:41.293 --> 12:43.094
 Or Kari?

12:43.095 --> 12:46.095
 -Sweet dreams all 'round.
 -Good night.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.640
 NARRATOR: Kari, Tory, and Grant
 are testing a myth

12:55.641 --> 12:57.142
 that says speeding up your car

12:57.143 --> 13:00.143
 might prevent
 this potential Alaskan roadkill

13:01.046 --> 13:03.681
 from killing you.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.216
 Back in San Francisco,

13:05.217 --> 13:07.752
 Kari's been on the Net
 looking for inspiration.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.753
 And believe it or not, she's
 found a thesis by a Swedish man

13:12.258 --> 13:15.258
 on how to build
 a giant rubber moose.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.029
 KARI:
 That's cool.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.430
 NARRATOR:
 With his permission,

13:19.431 --> 13:21.900
 they modify
 the multislice design

13:21.901 --> 13:24.901
 and source
 a small mountain of rubber.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.904
 Cool! Those are the jet cutters
 right there.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.842
 NARRATOR:
 With an OMAX waterjet cutter,

13:30.843 --> 13:33.843
 H2O Precision can carve our
 moose slices in next to no time.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.950
 Tory's already had the details
 of our design

13:38.951 --> 13:41.951
 punched into H2O's computer.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.922
 All right, here's our moose.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.957
 I know it doesn't look like
 much of a moose, but it will.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.426
 Now, what I have here
 are half-inch sheets of rubber.

13:48.427 --> 13:51.362
 Now, we have the design of our
 moose in the computer in slices.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.797
 Once we stack those together,

13:52.798 --> 13:54.999
 we'll have the shape
 of a moose in rubber.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
 This is one layer
 out of over 150 layers of rubber

13:58.003 --> 13:59.204
 that's gonna make up our moose.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.272
 Now, once we stack these
 together in the right order

14:01.273 --> 14:02.507
 and fasten it, we'll have

14:02.508 --> 14:05.508
 roughly the same size, weight,
 and density as a real moose.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.544
 NARRATOR: But a real fake moose
 needs more than sheer mass.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.216
 Back at M7, Kari adds
 the bones and the sinew.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.621
 This is the cable we're gonna
 use to keep the moose together.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.424
 This is gonna run the length
 of the moose twice,

14:19.425 --> 14:21.492
 and that way, when the car
 actually hits the moose,

14:21.493 --> 14:24.493
 the moose will stay flexible,
 bending as if it's a real moose.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.433
 NARRATOR: Kari sleeves the cable
 in rubber tubing,

14:28.434 --> 14:31.434
 and Grant's done
 likewise with the legs.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.871
 The deal is we want the legs --
 This is our moose leg.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.908
 We want them to be floppy.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.909
 But we also want them to be
 reusable once it gets hit.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.280
 So the hip joint's gonna be
 made out of steel,

14:44.350 --> 14:46.451
 and that's gonna connect
 to the cable

14:46.452 --> 14:48.353
 that's inside of the moose leg,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.555
 and when it gets hit,
 it'll go flying,

14:50.556 --> 14:53.157
 and then we can set it
 right back up again.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.393
 NARRATOR: Meantime,
 Tory's going gangbusters

14:55.394 --> 14:56.928
 with his half-inch fillets.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.730
 It looks good, though.
 Looks like a moose.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.999
 -I know, kind of.
 -What do you think?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.668
 -Lucy?
 -Lucy the moosey?

15:03.669 --> 15:05.503
 -Yeah.
 -I love it.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.239
 NARRATOR: Congratulations, Tory.
 It's a girl.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.240
 But does she have enough junk
 in the trunk?

15:11.677 --> 15:14.178
 All right,
 so, the moose is done,

15:14.179 --> 15:17.048
 and it looks like
 it's weighing about 620 pounds,

15:17.049 --> 15:19.050
 which is a good average
 for the type of moose

15:19.051 --> 15:20.785
 that would likely
 get hit by a car.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.520
 Now that the moose is done,
 we're gonna see

15:22.521 --> 15:23.655
 if we can make him stand up.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.656
 So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
 gonna build a pair of 2x4 legs

15:27.760 --> 15:29.460
 that the moose will sit on.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.129
 It'll cradle in.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.931
 So, that way, when the car comes
 crashing through,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.466
 it'll knock the legs away,
 and then the moose will behave

15:35.467 --> 15:37.201
 the way the moose will behave.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.404
 NARRATOR: Building the frame
 is no big deal,

15:39.405 --> 15:42.405
 but will it support
 the massive load we call Lucy?

15:43.208 --> 15:45.677
 TORY: Good moose.
 Stay.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.111
 NARRATOR: It does.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.680
 -Nice.
 -I love it.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.481
 NARRATOR: And it's
 at just the right height

15:50.482 --> 15:53.482
 for her -- ahem --
 ample proportions.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.120
 And like any cow
 to the slaughter,

15:56.121 --> 15:58.489
 it's best she doesn't
 know her destiny.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.824
 Shh.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.160
 I'm the moose whisperer.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.161
 All right,
 let's bring those cars in.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.466
 So, the myth states that
 the guys used a 20-second fuse

16:08.467 --> 16:09.500
 on their stick of dynamite.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.501
 Now, the question is,
 can a dog, from a cold start,

16:13.639 --> 16:16.574
 run to 125 feet,
 fetch a stick of dynamite,

16:16.575 --> 16:19.077
 and come on back
 in under 20 seconds?

16:19.078 --> 16:21.612
 And that's what we're
 about to answer with Rudy.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.181
 NARRATOR:
 Of course, for this test,

16:23.182 --> 16:25.516
 they swap the dynamite
 for a rubber ball,

16:25.517 --> 16:27.752
 but you get the idea.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.120
 We got our starting line.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.322
 We got the target pylon
 over there.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.323
 Let's just throw the ball
 a few times, and I'll time it.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.594
 I'll bet you can throw it
 to where he gets it

16:36.595 --> 16:38.296
 right about at that pylon
 and comes on back,

16:38.297 --> 16:41.297
 and we'll just see
 how long that takes.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.134
 NARRATOR:
 It sounds simple, but remember

16:43.135 --> 16:46.135
 that Rudy is not only skidding
 around on slippery ice,

16:47.106 --> 16:50.106
 but it's 20 degrees below zero.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.342
 Good boy!

16:51.343 --> 16:53.745
 NARRATOR: You'd think
 he'd get slower and slower,

16:53.746 --> 16:56.014
 but each successive
 fetch and return

16:56.015 --> 16:59.015
 reads the same on Adam's
 stopwatch -- 16 seconds.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.285
 JAMIE:
 So far, the idea that the dog

17:01.286 --> 17:04.055
 could actually get the stick
 of dynamite and bring it back

17:04.056 --> 17:05.455
 is looking really good.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.457
 It's totally doable as far
 as the myth is concerned.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.527
 NARRATOR: This whole myth
 is falling nicely into place.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.865
 Perhaps a little too nicely.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.165
 Here comes the bit

17:15.166 --> 17:17.769
 where we try blasting a hole
 through the ice...

17:17.770 --> 17:19.537
 Thanks, guys.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.538
 NARRATOR:... sinking this car
 with one stick of dynamite.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.209
 ADAM: So far, the Alaska myth
 is looking pretty good.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.877
 The dog did his job real well,

17:26.878 --> 17:28.813
 but now
 it all comes down to this.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.814
 If one stick of dynamite
 can't sink the car, it's busted.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.489
 NARRATOR:
 And now back to the myth

17:38.490 --> 17:40.691
 designed to separate
 Adam and Jamie

17:40.692 --> 17:43.692
 from their fragile faculties.

17:44.296 --> 17:47.031
 Day two dawns
 on our cabin-fever test,

17:47.032 --> 17:50.032
 though it should be noted
 that a midwinter Alaskan sunup

17:50.803 --> 17:53.803
 kicks in around 10:00 a. m.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.973
 Good morning.
 It is the morning of day two.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.974
 I have had a reasonably fitful
 night of sleep.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.312
 I had some really weird dreams.
 I, uh...

18:01.313 --> 18:04.015
 I dream I'm in a plane
 and slowly crashing

18:04.016 --> 18:06.984
 and slowly crashing down
 on a street in San Francisco,

18:06.985 --> 18:08.920
 and I'm way up at the cockpit,

18:08.921 --> 18:11.089
 and I turn to everyone
 and I say,

18:11.090 --> 18:14.090
 "Listen, I don't think
 this is a real plane crash,

18:14.293 --> 18:17.261
 'cause I happened to notice
 that I'm not wearing any pants."

18:17.262 --> 18:18.563
 [ Laughs ]

18:18.564 --> 18:20.498
 "And whenever I'm not wearing
 any pants,

18:20.499 --> 18:22.066
 it's probably a dream."

18:22.067 --> 18:25.067
 [ Laughs ]

18:27.539 --> 18:30.539
 NARRATOR: Kari's up already,
 bright-eyed, keen-eared,

18:31.009 --> 18:33.211
 and she's wearing pants.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.479
 KARI:
 It's early morning,

18:34.480 --> 18:36.814
 and this is actually
 the first surprise,

18:36.815 --> 18:38.182
 is that Jamie is still sleeping.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.217
 He's an early riser.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.119
 Usually, he's up doing exercise

18:41.120 --> 18:43.454
 and probably into the shop
 by 5:00 a. m.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.455
 Adam, on the other hand,
 is just a beehive.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.292
 NARRATOR: Jamie does eventually
 rouse himself

18:50.529 --> 18:53.529
 and starts the first
 of his two tests.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.933
 The cognitive test aims to see

18:55.934 --> 18:58.934
 if their mental faculties
 decrease over time.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.007
 The saliva test
 is a stress indicator,

19:03.008 --> 19:06.008
 but to get a fair reading, you
 can't eat or drink beforehand.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.281
 KARI:
 Oh, you know what, though?

19:10.282 --> 19:11.649
 I think he just took
 a drink of water

19:11.650 --> 19:13.317
 right before he took this test.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.318
 NARRATOR: So, this and, trust
 me, many spit tests to come

19:17.523 --> 19:19.624
 count for nothing.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.593
 Spit reading of 35.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.128
 This is the morning
 of the second day,

19:24.129 --> 19:26.831
 so apparently
 I'm pretty relaxed.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.832
 NARRATOR: Shame we can't say
 the same for Kari,

19:30.135 --> 19:32.236
 but biometrics aren't
 the only indication

19:32.237 --> 19:35.237
 of who is or isn't stressed
 and bewildered.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.277
 Hap Wurlitzer owns these cabins,

19:39.278 --> 19:42.278
 and he's come real close
 to misplacing his own marbles

19:42.481 --> 19:44.815
 through many a long winter.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.816
 It happens to everybody
 in Alaska, including me.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.954
 What would you consider
 the symptoms?

19:49.955 --> 19:52.955
 Well, it's probably being
 on edge, irritability...

19:53.825 --> 19:56.825
...angry-looking eyes,
 forgetfulness...

19:58.163 --> 19:59.597
 What's going on?

19:59.598 --> 20:02.598
...and sleeping extra time
 in the cabins.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.903
 NARRATOR: So, now we know
 what to look for.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.904
 Jamie's already a pinup boy
 for symptom number four.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.543
 Next door,
 Adam can't stop fidgeting.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.214
 KARI: Adam's body language
 at the moment

20:18.517 --> 20:21.517
 shows that he's sort of antsy.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.954
 Oh, he's going
 for the coat hanger.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.555
 I knew he would make something
 with the hanger.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.391
 I would totally make something
 with the coat hanger.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.392
 NARRATOR: Desperate times call
 for desperate diversions.

20:31.096 --> 20:33.965
 Adam's building
 a fancy desktop toy

20:33.966 --> 20:36.966
 from his one potential
 plaything, a wire coat hanger.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.405
 I've spent some time
 making a little whirligig here

20:41.406 --> 20:44.406
 out of one of the two coat
 hangers I found on the rack.

20:46.044 --> 20:48.379
 NARRATOR: Meantime,
 the big news from cabin two

20:48.380 --> 20:51.249
 is that Jamie's sitting up.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.250
 KARI: I think
 Jamie has reached full Buddha.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.922
 He has not moved in an hour.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.923
 NARRATOR: Before day's end,
 both boys find time

21:01.393 --> 21:02.727
 to write in their journals,

21:02.728 --> 21:05.728
 then repeat their cognitive
 and spit tests.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.033
 123?

21:09.034 --> 21:11.402
 What, are you crazy?
 Look at this.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.105
 NARRATOR: Okay,
 just forget the stress test.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.106
 What we all need here
 is a time out and a nice nap.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.211
 As the sun sets,
 it's hard to say

21:20.212 --> 21:23.212
 if either one technically
 has cabin fever.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.649
 The boys say no,
 but Kari's unconvinced.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.219
 She knows that every picture
 tells a story.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.292
 Now they've arrived
 at a specialized test track

21:34.293 --> 21:37.293
 for what should be
 a shattering debut.

21:38.263 --> 21:40.364
 KARI: Okay, this myth is
 really about hitting a moose,

21:40.365 --> 21:42.099
 'cause obviously,
 if you can stop in time,

21:42.100 --> 21:43.401
 that's gonna be the best choice.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.269
 Right.
 This is the point of no return.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.270
 You're gonna hit the moose.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.973
 The question is, is it better
 to speed up or slow down?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.775
 All right, what do you think,
 like 45 miles an hour?

21:50.776 --> 21:53.044
 It's a good average between
 highway and regular roads.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.145
 That sounds good.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.414
 NARRATOR:
 Crashing cars is more or less

21:56.415 --> 21:59.415
 what the folks at E-TECH Testing
 Services do for a living.

21:59.951 --> 22:02.951
 And parent company
 Energy Absorption Systems

22:03.221 --> 22:06.157
 make crash cushions,
 which could be useful

22:06.158 --> 22:09.158
 if this moose mayhem
 runs off the rails.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.763
 But that's highly unlikely.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.764
 A guide bar fitted to one wheel
 keeps the car on track,

22:16.201 --> 22:19.201
 and through a system of chains
 and pulleys, a truck tows it

22:20.238 --> 22:23.238
 from a safe distance
 in the opposite direction.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.312
 The reason why we came to E-TECH
 is 'cause they are set up

22:28.313 --> 22:29.313
 to test crashes.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.981
 That's what they do.
 They have a towing system.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.982
 It's a 2-to-1 ratio, so their
 towing vehicle only has to go

22:34.820 --> 22:37.321
 half as fast as the actual
 vehicle that's gonna crash.

22:37.322 --> 22:38.789
 Plus, they have a steering hub,

22:38.790 --> 22:40.624
 and he's attaching that
 right now, so that way,

22:40.625 --> 22:42.159
 our car won't veer off course

22:42.160 --> 22:44.662
 and we hit the moose
 right where we want.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.663
 NARRATOR: But crash-test cars
 still need crash-test dummies.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.434
 TORY:
 I think this is the first time

22:50.435 --> 22:53.170
 we've ever used Buster for what
 he was intended to be used for.

22:53.171 --> 22:56.171
 GRANT:
 It's a historic moment.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.842
 NARRATOR:
 With Buster buckled up,

22:57.843 --> 23:00.843
 we're ready for test number one.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.313
 Moose meets machine at 45 per.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.817
 Am I excited?
 You better believe I'm excited.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.352
 We just made
 a giant rubber moose,

23:08.353 --> 23:10.121
 and now we're gonna crash cars
 into it.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.089
 It doesn't get
 much better than this.

23:12.090 --> 23:15.090
 GRANT: Ohh!
 Here comes the car!

23:15.193 --> 23:18.193
 That's 20 miles an hour.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.264
 40. 45.

23:20.265 --> 23:23.265
 -Oh!
 -Oh!

23:25.137 --> 23:28.137
 Oh [bleep]

23:28.840 --> 23:31.008
 I mean, the car came careening
 at the moose,

23:31.009 --> 23:32.877
 hit the moose,
 the moose flies in the air.

23:32.878 --> 23:35.312
 The head kind of just falls
 to the ground.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.947
 We got exactly the results
 we need

23:36.948 --> 23:39.948
 and a lot of comedy out
 of this high-speed, I'm sure.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.719
 NARRATOR: Will speeding up or
 slowing down reduce the carnage?

23:45.690 --> 23:48.492
 And just how many cars
 can we afford to wreck

23:48.493 --> 23:51.493
 in the cause
 of sensible driving?

23:52.798 --> 23:55.798
 I've just had the worst night of
 sleep I've ever had in my life.

23:56.334 --> 23:59.036
 KARI: Jamie has gotten up and
 straightaway started eating.

23:59.037 --> 24:02.037
 He's not done his spit-swab
 test, which is a problem for me,

24:03.442 --> 24:05.009
 'cause it's gonna mess up
 my data.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.010
 Either he's forgetting, or he's
 just lost the plot completely.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.948
 NARRATOR:
 But don't underestimate

24:10.949 --> 24:13.217
 Adam's cold-weather quirks.

24:13.218 --> 24:16.218
 These long-life military rations
 are called MREs,

24:17.222 --> 24:19.123
 or meals ready to eat.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.124
 Some soldiers call them
 meals ready to expel.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.894
 For breakfast today, I'm gonna
 have a little jambalaya.

24:26.998 --> 24:29.567
 NARRATOR: It's not exactly
 toast and grapefruit,

24:29.568 --> 24:32.568
 but he might get a chance
 to test his chemical toilet.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.073
 [ Burps ] Oh!

24:36.074 --> 24:38.509
 I forgot to try
 the Tabasco in there.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.412
 NARRATOR:
 Yes, charming.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.114
 The morning wears on,
 and self-sufficient Jamie

24:44.115 --> 24:47.115
 finds there's one thing
 he can't live without.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.387
 I don't have any coffee,
 which bugs me,

24:50.388 --> 24:53.388
 because I'd be a lot more active
 and less inclined to just nap,

24:54.326 --> 24:57.326
 which I'm sure is scintillating
 TV, to watch me nap,

24:57.929 --> 25:00.929
 but it's not my decision.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.235
 Oh, great.
 We got a yeti outside.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.904
 KARI: I've decided to play
 a little prank on Jamie and Adam

25:06.905 --> 25:09.905
 with help
 with the ultimate urban legend.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.776
 [ Growls ]

25:12.777 --> 25:15.777
 NARRATOR: Jamie's cold stare
 shows he's not amused.

25:17.782 --> 25:20.751
 But Kari gets a better response
 from Adam.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.752
 [ Thumping, growling ]

25:27.692 --> 25:29.927
 [ Laughs loudly ]

25:29.928 --> 25:32.928
 He's hiding in the bathroom
 from the snow yeti.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.134
 [ Giggling ]

25:37.135 --> 25:40.135
 NARRATOR: Sounds like Kari's
 the one who's ready to crack.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.573
 I have to get out of here.

25:42.574 --> 25:45.574
 NARRATOR:
 But she has a remedy.

25:47.812 --> 25:49.446
 For one crazy hour,

25:49.447 --> 25:52.447
 Kari does everything worth
 doing on fresh, white snow.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.987
 And I mean everything.

25:56.988 --> 25:59.988
 It's my best work yet.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.695
 Well, guys,
 it's the moment of truth.

26:04.696 --> 26:07.631
 It's time to put a stick
 of dynamite under this S. U.V.

26:07.632 --> 26:08.632
 and see what happens.

26:08.633 --> 26:10.034
 Oh, yeah, man.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.636
 All of our facts so far have
 stacked up pretty plausible.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.138
 This is the last link
 in the chain.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.640
 Frank, do you have the stick
 of dynamite for us?

26:16.641 --> 26:19.410
 Right here it is --
 the real thing.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.411
 That is red and everything.
 That's perfect.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.181
 NARRATOR:
 Now cover your ears,

26:24.182 --> 26:27.182
 and thank goodness
 you're not here on Fischer Pond.

26:27.352 --> 26:28.519
 This is what happens

26:28.520 --> 26:30.821
 when Mythbusters
 play with dynamite.

26:30.822 --> 26:33.822
 ADAM:
 Fire in the hole!

26:36.394 --> 26:37.995
 NARRATOR:
 Almost nothing.

26:37.996 --> 26:40.798
 JAMIE: I see a little dent
 there, and that's about it.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.466
 DOYLE: Yeah, other than that,
 no damage.

26:42.467 --> 26:45.467
 The dog would have been gone.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.305
 But the truck's still here.

26:48.306 --> 26:50.407
 Look, the ice
 that we're on right now

26:50.408 --> 26:52.876
 is a good average thickness
 for a frozen lake

26:52.877 --> 26:55.877
 that you'd feel safe driving
 an automobile out onto.

26:56.014 --> 26:59.014
 So, based on what we've seen,
 we have to call it busted.

27:03.254 --> 27:06.090
 NARRATOR:
 Busted, but not beaten.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.091
 We've all come a long way
 in the freezing cold

27:09.094 --> 27:11.595
 to see a good, old-fashioned
 truck sinking,

27:11.596 --> 27:14.596
 and 2 dozen pounds of dynamite

27:14.766 --> 27:17.534
 packed inside these high-tech
 directional cones

27:17.535 --> 27:20.404
 should do the trick.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.405
 Well, it's clear from the hole
 pattern I see around the car

27:23.775 --> 27:26.775
 that we've got a nasty case
 of ice gophers.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.747
 These little varmints
 will bore their way

27:29.748 --> 27:32.182
 around any vehicle
 they find on the ice

27:32.183 --> 27:34.752
 to chew on it underwater.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.587
 There's only one way
 to take care of them,

27:36.588 --> 27:38.522
 and that's high explosives.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.591
 Fire in the hole!

27:40.592 --> 27:42.760
 Fire in the hole!

27:42.761 --> 27:44.962
 Fire in the hole!

27:44.963 --> 27:47.963
 3, 2, 1.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.167
 -Bye-bye!
 -Oh!

27:52.270 --> 27:55.270
 Criminy!

27:55.774 --> 27:58.542
 NARRATOR: The ice ripples out
 like a liquid earthquake.

27:58.543 --> 28:01.543
 Surface snow fills the air
 and blurs the view.

28:04.582 --> 28:07.582
 By the time it clears,
 the car has disappeared.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.255
 I don't see no S. U.V.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.323
 No more S. U.V.

28:13.324 --> 28:16.324
 It went bye-bye.

28:16.828 --> 28:17.961
 So, what do you think?

28:17.962 --> 28:20.962
 Did it just blow the truck up,
 or did it sink it?

28:21.166 --> 28:24.166
 Well, I see a couple pieces
 of debris from the truck,

28:24.235 --> 28:25.502
 but nothing major.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.104
 I think it sank it.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.273
 99 % of that truck's
 under the water.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.542
 Let's yank on the chain
 and see what happens.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.711
 [ Laughs ] Okay.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.513
 NARRATOR: Incredibly,
 this fresh-blasted duck pond

28:36.514 --> 28:38.649
 is already freezing over.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.650
 Adam and Jamie really don't know
 for sure where the car went,

28:42.587 --> 28:44.455
 but a few tugs on the chain

28:44.456 --> 28:47.124
 confirm they've got
 a 2-ton catch.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.325
 ADAM: [ Sighs ]

28:48.326 --> 28:50.194
 I think we're gonna need
 more explosives

28:50.195 --> 28:51.829
 to get this truck out.

28:51.830 --> 28:52.963
 I think we are.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.298
 If they worked putting it in,

28:54.299 --> 28:56.233
 they're gonna work
 getting it back out again.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.234
 That's true.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.936
 [ Both laugh ]

28:58.937 --> 29:01.472
 NARRATOR: No,
 we're not yanking your chain.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.473
 To get the car back, they have
 to blast the ice one more time.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.615
 Filming stops
 as the light fades,

29:11.616 --> 29:14.351
 but the car was retrieved.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.352
 We've left this pristine pond
 pretty much the way we found it,

29:18.490 --> 29:21.490
 busting a myth and saving
 a puppy in the process.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.993
 [ Barking ]

29:22.994 --> 29:24.595
 Um, well, the sun is out,

29:24.596 --> 29:27.331
 and it's made it
 unfathomably beautiful out here.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.800
 I don't know whether the sun
 is just about to set

29:29.801 --> 29:31.401
 over the mountain there

29:31.402 --> 29:34.402
 or has just risen
 over the mountain there.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.607
 I've already lost
 all my concept of time.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.978
 NARRATOR: And here's
 what's happened so far.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.015
 They've been bored.

29:45.016 --> 29:46.083
 They've slept.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.152
 They've exercised.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.654
 They've gone back to sleep.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.490
 I napped the first day
 because I could.

29:53.491 --> 29:54.591
 It was great.

29:54.592 --> 29:56.794
 Get up when you want.
 Go to sleep when you want.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.795
 NARRATOR: And by drinking
 just before the saliva tests,

29:59.864 --> 30:02.864
 they've both ruined any chance
 of accurate stress data.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.837
 Having just woken up from a nap,

30:06.838 --> 30:09.838
 it's saying
 that my stress reading is 94.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.511
 Here, look.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.247
 NARRATOR:
 Okay, that's just scary.

30:17.248 --> 30:20.248
 Meantime, Jamie's decided
 to hold a one-man convention

30:21.119 --> 30:23.754
 and draft
 a new U.S. Constitution --

30:23.755 --> 30:25.222
 seriously.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.691
 You know, it started because
 we started seeing T-shirts

30:27.692 --> 30:30.594
 that says, "Savage-Hyneman '08."

30:30.595 --> 30:32.763
 The first thing that we'll do

30:32.764 --> 30:35.764
 is relocate all politicians
 to employment on pork farms.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.005
 And then we'll pretty much start
 from the ground up

30:42.006 --> 30:45.006
 and try to come up with a system
 that actually works.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.247
 You know, get people
 that run the country

30:50.248 --> 30:53.248
 that are actually literate,
 things like that.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.420
 NARRATOR:
 This test has run its course,

30:56.421 --> 30:59.421
 and Kari's ready
 to pull the plug.

31:00.658 --> 31:03.493
 KARI: Adam's been both irritable
 and really restless.

31:03.494 --> 31:04.928
 He's been pacing
 around the room.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.463
 Both of them
 have been forgetful.

31:06.464 --> 31:07.798
 Either they're not
 doing their tests --

31:07.799 --> 31:08.866
 they're forgetting to do them --

31:08.867 --> 31:10.534
 or they're making
 a lot of mistakes.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.535
 And finally,
 they are sleeping a whole lot.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.341
 It's practically hibernation.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.643
 These could be the symptoms
 of cabin fever.

31:19.644 --> 31:22.644
 I've seen enough.
 I'm gonna bust them out.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.086
 You had enough?

31:29.087 --> 31:31.855
 [ Laughs ]
 I've definitely had enough.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.524
 This was far
 from the, like, relaxing respite

31:34.525 --> 31:37.525
 that I thought it would be.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.463
 NARRATOR:
 Now, let's see how Jamie coped

31:39.464 --> 31:42.199
 with just Jamie for company.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.401
 JAMIE: The worst part
 was the beginning --

31:44.402 --> 31:45.802
 [bleep] off at being here

31:45.803 --> 31:48.238
 because you're
 in a closed-up room.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.406
 Chances are
 you're not gonna like it

31:49.407 --> 31:51.775
 as much as if you had
 all the normal stimulants.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.911
 Have you had enough?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.079
 I'm just starting
 to get into it.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.115
 I'm not sure what that proves,

31:58.116 --> 32:00.217
 and I was a little [bleep]
 off about it,

32:00.218 --> 32:03.218
 but that being said,
 then I started to get into it.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.925
 I craved the sound
 of the human voice.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.159
 I missed my wife.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.160
 Um, l-l haven't been bored,

32:12.897 --> 32:15.098
 but I have been really lonely.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.934
 NARRATOR:
 But the real question remains.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.935
 Did either one ever lose
 his fragile grip on sanity?

32:21.973 --> 32:23.473
 The cognitive-test results

32:23.474 --> 32:25.776
 were too consistent
 to prove anything,

32:25.777 --> 32:28.777
 and they both blew
 the spit tests.

32:29.213 --> 32:32.213
 But Kari's kept a lookout
 for Hap's four sure signs...

32:33.318 --> 32:34.751
 What's going on with me?

32:34.752 --> 32:35.886
 NARRATOR:
...irritability...

32:35.887 --> 32:38.887
 The mattress
 was [Sniffs] terrible.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.058
 NARRATOR:
...forgetfulness,

32:41.059 --> 32:42.259
 angry eyes...

32:42.260 --> 32:44.094
 Oh, yeah.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.762
 NARRATOR:
...and excessive sleeping.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.665
 Napping in the afternoon,
 napping in the morning.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.001
 I love napping.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.803
 All right, guys, how do
 you want to call this one?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.538
 Well, based on the surveillance,

32:54.539 --> 32:57.539
 you exhibited four out of four
 of the cabin-fever symptoms,

32:57.842 --> 32:58.976
 and you one.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.344
 Yeah, but he's a robot.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.379
 And I just got in.
 It was a long trip.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.413
 I was tired.

33:03.414 --> 33:04.848
 I think we could call this
 plausible.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.184
 -Plausible it is.
 -Okay, plausible.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.418
 Can I go back to the room now?

33:08.419 --> 33:11.419
 [ Laughs ]

33:15.793 --> 33:17.694
 NARRATOR:
 There's no doubt about it.

33:17.695 --> 33:18.462
 Go.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.163
 NARRATOR:
 Hitting an average-size moose

33:20.164 --> 33:23.164
 in an average-size car
 can only end in tears.

33:23.468 --> 33:25.569
 You know, it's like
 you're driving down the road,

33:25.570 --> 33:27.504
 you're eating your baked Alaska,

33:27.505 --> 33:29.473
 and all of a sudden,
 a moose is in front of you,

33:29.474 --> 33:31.875
 and you're like --
 You don't have time to swerve.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.144
 You're gonna hit the moose,
 but now the question is,

33:34.145 --> 33:37.145
 is it better to accelerate into
 the moose or hit the brakes?

33:37.148 --> 33:40.050
 NARRATOR: Some say
 it's better to speed up.

33:40.051 --> 33:43.051
 But let's first test
 this Alaskan roadkill myth

33:43.388 --> 33:46.388
 by slowing down.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.724
 Grant's installed
 a remote-control braking system

33:49.861 --> 33:52.861
 that's every bit as effective as
 a panicked human's right foot.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.866
 GRANT: So, the remote braking
 system is radio-controlled,

33:58.069 --> 33:59.369
 and what that does is send
 a signal

33:59.370 --> 34:01.004
 to the receiver inside the car,

34:01.005 --> 34:04.005
 activates a pneumatic solenoid
 that fires a pneumatic cylinder,

34:04.709 --> 34:07.709
 and that will pop the brake
 very, very quickly,

34:08.746 --> 34:11.348
 just as if you were
 to stamp hard on it.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.884
 NARRATOR: They know
 that at 45 miles per hour,

34:13.885 --> 34:16.885
 the car takes 70 feet to stop.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.556
 So, to best simulate
 a real accident,

34:19.556 --> 34:20.891
 they plan to hit the brake

34:20.891 --> 34:23.326
 and, in a later test,
 the accelerator

34:23.327 --> 34:26.327
 just 30 feet short
 of our makeshift moose.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.331
 Buster's had enough,

34:29.333 --> 34:31.868
 so Cousin Ted
 is the designated driver.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.638
 -GRANT: Yeah, there you go.
 -TORY: Attaboy.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.840
 -We are ready to go.
 -TORY: All right.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.841
 Grant will hit the brakes
 30 feet before we hit the moose.

34:40.344 --> 34:41.344
 Are we ready?

34:41.344 --> 34:44.344
 Ready.
 In 3, 2, 1.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.783
 We're going.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.284
 Here it comes.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.286
 All right, we're at 45.

 [ Tires screeching ]

 [ Cheering ]

34:55.827 --> 34:56.493
 Nice!

34:56.494 --> 34:58.161
 -Yeah, hit the moose.
 -Sweet.

34:58.162 --> 35:00.664
 TORY: Dude, look at that.
 It stopped perfectly. Wow.

35:00.665 --> 35:03.665
 NARRATOR: It's another
 windshield wipe-out.

35:04.735 --> 35:07.735
 But they all agree that
 this time there's less damage,

35:08.439 --> 35:10.340
 and that could mean
 the difference

35:10.341 --> 35:12.442
 between life and death.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.378
 But they've also noticed
 that the moose hit higher

35:15.379 --> 35:16.480
 when the car went faster.

35:16.481 --> 35:19.481
 I'm starting to think
 that if you speed up,

35:21.352 --> 35:23.720
 if you accelerate
 like in the myth,

35:23.721 --> 35:26.721
 it might actually hit
 even higher.

35:27.091 --> 35:29.726
 Now, whether
 it's gonna clear the car,

35:29.727 --> 35:32.727
 I'm not entirely
 convinced of yet.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.667
 Snap out of it.

35:37.668 --> 35:40.668
 NARRATOR: This is the test
 that might confirm the myth.

35:40.671 --> 35:43.671
 Just 30 feet short
 of certain catastrophe,

35:43.708 --> 35:46.708
 driver Brian's been told
 to hit the gas.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.812
 Okay.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.747
 All right,
 this is acceleration test.

 Ready, Kari?

 We are ready.

 That was great.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.504
 Wow! Did you see how high
 the moose got on that hit?

36:16.541 --> 36:19.541
 It looked like it got higher
 than any of the other hits.

36:20.545 --> 36:23.545
 Oh, my God, look.
 It broke the back window out.

 But it didn't clear the car.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.055
 The side pillars are crushed,

36:32.056 --> 36:34.991
 and the roof is peeled back
 like a sardine tin.

 the midsection of the car down.

 It went whoosh!

36:42.500 --> 36:43.600
 So, what do you think?

36:43.601 --> 36:46.601
 Going faster doesn't look like
 it's a better tactic.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.972
 I mean, you are accelerating.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.107
 You're hitting
 with greater force.

36:51.108 --> 36:52.976
 More speed is more energy.

 are midsize sedans.

 What if your car
 is a low-profile coupe?

 The roof is lower, so Lucy
 might sail right over the top.

 already made her mind up.

 Personally, I think people

 way too many cartoons

 from Wile E. Coyote.

 when he goes off a cliff,

37:20.972 --> 37:22.439
 he hangs there for a minute
 before he falls.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.141

 that the moose gets hit, phoosh,
