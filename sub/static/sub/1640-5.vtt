00:03.273 --> 00:05.708
Come on, Gabi, let's go.
Happy Hour is almost over.

00:05.709 --> 00:08.197
I want cheap appetizers and hot guys.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.037
Or hot appetizers and cheap guys.

00:11.341 --> 00:14.507
_

00:15.151 --> 00:18.384
You know who also is ranch? Josh!

00:18.385 --> 00:20.290
Funny story...

00:20.291 --> 00:21.712
_

00:22.677 --> 00:25.797
Do you know the definition of funny story?

00:27.129 --> 00:28.717
Hey, Sofia!

00:28.989 --> 00:30.803
Did Gabi tell you about my little party?

00:30.804 --> 00:32.622
She's going to a happy hour.

00:32.622 --> 00:35.379
Caroline went to NY to
see the wedding dress...

00:35.380 --> 00:37.209
With her friend...

00:38.489 --> 00:42.128
While she's gone I'm gonna have a party.

00:42.193 --> 00:43.275
Guess how I'm gonna call it.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.107
_

00:47.054 --> 00:48.225
Told you.

00:48.226 --> 00:49.533
Wanna hear what I'm making?

00:49.534 --> 00:50.428
- Yes.
- No.

00:50.429 --> 00:53.040
_

00:53.041 --> 00:54.451
That's hot.

00:54.452 --> 00:56.539
_

00:56.540 --> 00:58.637
- Don't stop.
- Chili cheese fries with sour cream.

00:58.638 --> 00:59.884
- Keep going.
- And for dessert...

00:59.885 --> 01:02.099
- Yeah?
- Double-stuffed deep-fried oreos.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.301
Oh, my God!

01:03.352 --> 01:07.054
Ugh, I never thought I'd
miss the Blue Chee Story.

01:07.105 --> 01:09.223
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:11.360 --> 01:13.444
What the hell was that?

01:13.478 --> 01:15.146
What?

01:15.148 --> 01:17.148
You two just had...

01:17.150 --> 01:19.317
- An oreo-gasm!
- (Elevator dings)

01:19.319 --> 01:22.370
I mean, I finally get why you don't
care about meeting guys anymore.

01:22.404 --> 01:23.554
You treat Josh like he's your boyfriend.

01:23.589 --> 01:26.290
I do not!

01:26.325 --> 01:28.326
Please... You're so hung up on him.

01:28.377 --> 01:30.494
No, I'm not, okay? We had
one drunken night a month ago.

01:30.496 --> 01:31.529
I'm over that!

01:31.563 --> 01:33.331
Oh, really? You're over it?

01:33.382 --> 01:34.549
When was your last date?

01:36.168 --> 01:37.301
What was last Saturday?

01:37.336 --> 01:39.387
The twelfth.

01:39.438 --> 01:41.172
Then, uh...

01:41.223 --> 01:43.174
Four months ago.

01:45.177 --> 01:46.344
You might be right, Sofia.

01:46.346 --> 01:50.181
Thank you! You need to get back
out there, start dating again.

01:50.215 --> 01:53.150
Turn your taxi light on, so
guys know you're available.

01:53.185 --> 01:54.352
Oh, and I am.

01:54.354 --> 01:56.404
Taxi Gabi's ready fo' a ride.

01:56.438 --> 01:58.222
(Elevator dings)

01:59.441 --> 02:02.159
Well, that worked fast.

02:02.194 --> 02:04.028
Hey there!

02:04.079 --> 02:05.112
Hi!

02:05.163 --> 02:06.197
You going down?

02:06.231 --> 02:09.366
Well... not without dinner and a movie.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.370

02:20.212 --> 02:23.464
So, my building's a little bit
of a... Step down from yours.

02:23.515 --> 02:26.467
You have a doorman... I have
a chalk outline of a doorman...

02:29.104 --> 02:32.189
Listen, I'd invite you in, but I went
a little fast with the last guy...

02:32.224 --> 02:34.275
We had one night together and then...

02:34.309 --> 02:36.477
The next day, he proposed...

02:36.528 --> 02:38.446
To someone else.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.114
Sounds like a country song.

02:40.148 --> 02:42.233
(Laughs) Yeah.

02:42.284 --> 02:43.567
Um, I'm cool to take it slow...

02:43.602 --> 02:46.404
I have an early morning
anyway, I should go.

02:46.438 --> 02:48.572
Yeah, you...

02:48.574 --> 02:50.241
You should go.

02:50.243 --> 02:51.242
I should.

02:51.244 --> 02:53.077
You should really go.

02:56.465 --> 02:58.416
<i>(Thumping)</i>

03:05.507 --> 03:06.507
Hey.

03:08.393 --> 03:10.194
Sounds like that went well.

03:10.228 --> 03:12.480
Sofia, he's smart...

03:12.514 --> 03:14.181
He's funny...

03:14.232 --> 03:16.100
And he's a great kisser.

03:16.151 --> 03:19.270
What I hear you saying
is: "Thank you, Sofia!"

03:19.272 --> 03:20.354
Yes! Thank you, Sofia!

03:20.405 --> 03:22.106
You're the best friend ever!

03:22.157 --> 03:26.277
Cam is sweet and thoughtful and he totally
respects the fact that I wanna go slow.

03:26.311 --> 03:29.363
Wait... what if just left
because he doesn't like me?

03:29.414 --> 03:34.085
How good does it feel to lose
your self-esteem over a guy, again?

03:34.119 --> 03:35.286
So good!

03:35.337 --> 03:36.337
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:38.423 --> 03:40.424
- Hey, Gabi.
- Hey, Yolanda!

03:40.459 --> 03:43.294
How are you on this perfect,
beautiful, angel-like morning?

03:46.465 --> 03:50.518
Someone's either on a sugar high
or a "got them some sugar" high.

03:52.437 --> 03:55.139
Well, I know I don't usually talk
about my personal life at work

03:55.190 --> 03:56.524
because I didn't have one, but...

03:56.558 --> 03:58.225
I do now!

03:58.276 --> 04:00.311
Really? Who's the lucky guy?

04:00.313 --> 04:01.312
Did you meet him online?

04:01.314 --> 04:04.148
No, on nine!

04:04.199 --> 04:05.483
His name's Cam, he lives in the building.

04:05.485 --> 04:06.484
I met him in the elevator.

04:06.535 --> 04:08.285
The elevator?!

04:10.072 --> 04:12.289
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

04:12.324 --> 04:16.410
I mean, it's free, it's close by, and if
a man lives in this fancy-pants building,

04:16.461 --> 04:20.164
he can afford some fancy pants. (Laughs)

04:20.214 --> 04:21.382
Speaking of...

04:22.467 --> 04:24.135
What are you skipping for?

04:24.169 --> 04:26.253
Did Channing Tatum come out the closet?

04:26.304 --> 04:31.058
I'm happy because I'm about to
get invited to Josh's party, watch.

04:32.177 --> 04:33.394
Hey, Josh.

04:34.479 --> 04:37.181
I got a surprise for your party.

04:37.232 --> 04:39.567
An advanced copy of "Corpses of War 15".

04:39.601 --> 04:43.521
"Corpse-Pocalypse?" Yes! I've
been dying to play this game.

04:43.572 --> 04:45.406
Me too!

04:47.526 --> 04:49.410
And since it's so hard to get...

04:49.444 --> 04:52.363
I was wondering, is there
anyone else you want to invite?

04:52.414 --> 04:54.532
Someone who loves this game or...

04:54.534 --> 04:58.085
Someone who just said he loves this game?

04:59.254 --> 05:01.088
Yes! My buddy Amir.

05:01.123 --> 05:03.374
A... what? Who?

05:03.376 --> 05:04.458
Thanks, Elliot!

05:07.379 --> 05:10.214
Looks like the only skipping
you doing is the party.

05:11.383 --> 05:13.050
(Doorbell rings)

05:13.052 --> 05:15.052
(Laughs) Oh, God, I just crack myself up!

05:18.106 --> 05:21.358
Hi, I'm Cam. I'm here to see Gabi.

05:21.393 --> 05:24.111
Cam, Cam, the elevator man!

05:28.200 --> 05:30.317
Hey Cam! What are you doing here?

05:30.368 --> 05:32.536
I know you're working, but I
just wanted to stop by real quick

05:32.571 --> 05:35.072
and tell you what a great
time I had last night.

05:35.123 --> 05:37.458
Aww, well, you know, you
coulda just texted me.

05:37.492 --> 05:39.243
You can't text this.

05:42.247 --> 05:44.131
Cam, I'm at work.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.466
Hmmm...

05:45.500 --> 05:47.251
That some sweet-tasting lip gloss.

05:47.302 --> 05:48.385
Thanks!

05:48.420 --> 05:50.087
You're not allergic to frosting, are you?

05:50.138 --> 05:51.255
I don't know, is anything swelling up?

05:51.306 --> 05:53.140
(Gasps)

05:53.175 --> 05:54.558
Oh, sweet lord.

05:57.229 --> 05:58.479
So... tonight...

05:58.513 --> 06:00.264
I'd love to!

06:00.315 --> 06:02.316
- You were gonna ask me out, right?
- Yeah.

06:02.350 --> 06:05.269
Ah, great! There's this great
new bar I've been dying to try.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.104
Kinda over the bar scene.

06:07.155 --> 06:09.273
Oh yeah, to... It's so loud and phony.

06:09.275 --> 06:10.491
Hi there!

06:10.525 --> 06:12.443
- I'm Josh
- Cam.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.028
Uh, so, I hear you live in the building.

06:14.079 --> 06:15.079
Do you live in the penthouse too?

06:15.113 --> 06:16.163
Uh, no, I'm on nine.

06:16.198 --> 06:18.165
Oh, nine... I heard those places are cute!

06:18.200 --> 06:20.117
Real cozy.

06:21.286 --> 06:23.170
Okay, thanks for stopping by.

06:23.205 --> 06:24.455
Uh, do you wanna pick me up around eight?

06:24.506 --> 06:26.457
How about seven? It's sooner.

06:26.459 --> 06:28.459
Okay.

06:28.461 --> 06:30.511
- Great meeting you.
- Alright.

06:30.545 --> 06:34.131
Real pleasure.

06:34.133 --> 06:35.382
(Gasps) How great is he?

06:35.433 --> 06:36.467
I don't like him.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.471
- What?
- There's something off about him...

06:40.473 --> 06:42.356
- His face is...
- Gorgeous?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.475
- No, his eyes, they're...
- Deep pools of sapphire?

06:44.526 --> 06:49.180
- His entire demeanor is...
- Sexy as hell!

06:49.214 --> 06:50.364
Thank you, Yolanda.

06:50.398 --> 06:52.566
Look, you asked, I'm just telling you.

06:52.617 --> 06:53.534
I got a gut feeling about him.

06:53.568 --> 06:55.119
My gut is never wrong.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.287
Your gut is wrong this time.

06:56.321 --> 06:57.288
No, it isn't!

06:57.322 --> 07:00.074
Gabi, I'm telling you,
you should stop seeing him.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.459
What? Josh! No, there's
nothing wrong with him!

07:02.494 --> 07:06.080
Yes, there is! I'm not sure what,
but there's something about him.

07:06.131 --> 07:07.414
It's only a matter of
time before it comes out.

07:07.465 --> 07:10.134
And when it does, mark my words, you're
gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.

07:10.168 --> 07:12.169
Oh, really? Well I think you're
the one who's gonna be sorry

07:12.220 --> 07:14.338
that you didn't listen to me
when the truth doesn't come out,

07:14.372 --> 07:17.360
which sounds wrong, but, in fact, is
right, like you were not about Cam.

07:19.828 --> 07:21.078
I think I made my point.

07:23.715 --> 07:24.832
(Elevator dings)

07:28.053 --> 07:30.087
- I love you.
- I love you too.

07:32.107 --> 07:34.075
And... the truth comes out.

07:35.611 --> 07:36.890
♪ ♪

07:37.038 --> 07:39.761
Anyway, Josh told Cam his place is "cozy".

07:39.795 --> 07:41.763
I mean, it was so mean and judge-y.

07:41.797 --> 07:44.632
It was kinda like us when
we watch "The Bachelor".

07:44.683 --> 07:47.468
Oh, my God. It is so
obvious what's going on.

07:47.519 --> 07:48.836
I know...

07:48.854 --> 07:50.838
What?

07:50.873 --> 07:52.724
Josh is jealous of you and Cam.

07:52.775 --> 07:53.975
Why?! (Screams)

07:54.009 --> 07:55.526
(Gasps) Why?

07:57.646 --> 07:59.564
Why would he be jealous?
He's engaged to be married.

07:59.615 --> 08:01.849
Because you guys slept together!

08:01.884 --> 08:04.485
Look, men are like dogs.

08:04.487 --> 08:07.555
Once a dog pees on a tree, he
doesn't one another dog peeing there.

08:10.743 --> 08:12.894
Josh can't pick who pees on me.

08:12.928 --> 08:14.796
Yeah!

08:14.830 --> 08:16.798
Exactly! He's not the boss of you!

08:16.832 --> 08:18.833
Actually he is... This is not really fair!

08:18.884 --> 08:21.552
(Gasps) Not fair!

08:22.838 --> 08:24.839
Look, you want Josh out
of your personal life?

08:24.890 --> 08:27.725
Well, then you're just gonna
have to be professional...

08:27.760 --> 08:30.511
- And set some boundaries...
- Okay, alright...

08:30.562 --> 08:31.846
I'm gonna set one right now.

08:31.897 --> 08:34.515
You're not going any higher.

08:35.717 --> 08:36.768
(Cell phone sounds)

08:36.818 --> 08:38.720
Oh, sweet! Woody's coming tonight.

08:38.736 --> 08:39.687
Guess who he's bringing.

08:39.738 --> 08:40.905
Buzz Lightyear?

08:44.727 --> 08:46.577
Elliot, is everything okay?

08:46.612 --> 08:47.829
Yeah...

08:47.863 --> 08:49.697
I just don't care about your party.

08:49.699 --> 08:54.619
I've got plans of my own,
big plans I can't talk about.

08:54.670 --> 08:59.540
And by "big plans", don't you mean...
Table for one at "Color Me Mine".

09:01.627 --> 09:04.679
Please let me come to your party, please!

09:04.713 --> 09:07.849
Why would you want to? You've
nothing in common with these people.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.517
They're nerds, they're awkward.

09:09.551 --> 09:10.718
Most of 'em never slept with a woman.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.719
Neither have I!

09:11.721 --> 09:13.638
I'll fit in perfectly!

09:14.923 --> 09:17.725
I'm like a beige wingtip,
I go with everything.

09:20.696 --> 09:22.530
Okay, fine.

09:22.564 --> 09:24.599
But promise me you will never say
anything like that at the party.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.734
I won't. Don't worry.

09:26.736 --> 09:28.569
I'll just be one of the boys.

09:28.571 --> 09:29.620
Yay!

09:30.956 --> 09:34.876
Hey sorry I'm late, I couldn't find
the coat hanger that starts my car.

09:35.911 --> 09:38.579
Gabi...

09:38.581 --> 09:41.466
Um... I'm glad you're here.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.884
There's something I wanna tell
you, you should sit down for this.

09:42.918 --> 09:44.635
Oh, no... who died?

09:44.670 --> 09:47.755
Am I fired? I didn't do it.

09:48.974 --> 09:49.924
I wanna talk to you about Cam.

09:49.975 --> 09:51.926
No! Josh... you know what?

09:51.977 --> 09:54.812
I really don't wanna discuss my
personal life at work anymore, okay?

09:54.847 --> 09:59.767
From now on, I just want us to have a
completely professional relationship.

09:59.818 --> 10:00.902
Hmmm.

10:00.936 --> 10:02.770
I hear ya.

10:04.656 --> 10:05.907
I get it.

10:07.643 --> 10:09.694
But I happen to see Cam hugging
another women in the lobby

10:09.745 --> 10:11.696
and he even said he loved her.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.614
Oh, my God. Sofia was right.

10:13.665 --> 10:16.701
- She doesn't like him either?
- Nope. You are jealous.

10:16.752 --> 10:17.919
Jealous?!

10:17.953 --> 10:21.672
Jealous of what? You heard
him, he lives on nine!

10:21.707 --> 10:23.541
You don't want anyone
else peeing on my tree!

10:23.592 --> 10:27.628
- What?
- That's why you're making this up.

10:27.630 --> 10:30.715
Look, Gabi, before you go accusing
me of being jealous and a liar,

10:30.766 --> 10:32.717
just go downstairs and
ask Cam who he's hugging.

10:32.768 --> 10:34.969
No, that's ridiculous! That
would be insulting to him!

10:34.971 --> 10:37.855
And it would make me look insecure
and jealous, which I'm not!

10:37.890 --> 10:40.575
I would never do something like that!

10:42.861 --> 10:45.947
- Surprise!
- Hey Gabi! Uh...

10:45.981 --> 10:47.865
Now's not really a good time...

10:47.900 --> 10:49.650
Can I just see you later for our date?

10:49.701 --> 10:51.536
<i>Cammy, who's at the door?</i>

10:51.570 --> 10:53.654
Please tell me you have a cockatoo.

10:55.574 --> 10:56.624
Who's this?

10:56.658 --> 10:58.826
Uh, I am Gabi. Who's this?

10:58.911 --> 11:01.662
I'm Cammy's mom.

11:01.664 --> 11:06.500
Oh, of course, you must be the new
S.A.T. Tutor he's been raving about.

11:08.904 --> 11:11.606
Cammy...? His mom...?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.674
S.A.T.S?

11:13.676 --> 11:17.645
You know, to be honest, I was afraid
he wasn't gonna graduate high school.

11:19.598 --> 11:21.515
High school?! When
where you afraid of that?

11:21.567 --> 11:23.734
Like... like five years ago? (Laughs)

11:24.920 --> 11:26.654
Please.

11:26.688 --> 11:27.755
(Oven dings)

11:27.789 --> 11:29.690
Oh, excuse me a moment,
got something in the oven.

11:29.692 --> 11:31.692
Okay, well, don't worry about it.

11:31.694 --> 11:33.778
Cam and I are just
gonna... How old are you?!

11:35.747 --> 11:37.832
- Age is just a number.
- Yeah...

11:37.866 --> 11:40.868
What is the number?!

11:40.903 --> 11:44.922
- 17.
- (Gasps)

11:44.957 --> 11:46.958
Oh, my God!

11:47.009 --> 11:50.811
No wonder you left early from
our date, you have a curfew!

11:50.846 --> 11:52.713
Only on school nights.

11:52.715 --> 11:55.967
And you're not into the bar scene
because you can't get into one!

11:56.018 --> 11:57.885
But my cousin is getting me...

11:57.887 --> 12:01.722
Shut up, kid!

12:01.724 --> 12:04.525
Gabi, can you join us for dinner?

12:04.559 --> 12:06.727
Um, thank you, but, uh, I actually...

12:06.729 --> 12:09.814
I already have dinner plans,
I'll be eating crow... quettes.

12:11.566 --> 12:14.568
Wait, let me, at least,
take a selfie of us.

12:14.570 --> 12:15.736
Fun...

12:15.738 --> 12:17.905
I want a picture of his amazing tutor...

12:17.956 --> 12:19.573
(Camera clicks)

12:19.625 --> 12:22.793
Especially, if he gets into Berkley.

12:22.828 --> 12:24.578
Oh, well, uh...

12:24.630 --> 12:26.580
Don't need to worry about
that, he's already scoring...

12:26.632 --> 12:28.499
Way above his grade level!

12:33.444 --> 12:34.477
Hey, Gabi.

12:36.314 --> 12:37.647
Where ya been?

12:37.698 --> 12:39.449
Nowhere, I've been nowhere.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.570
Oh, really? And where exactly is nowhere?

12:43.621 --> 12:47.374
Maybe down on nine?

12:47.408 --> 12:48.625
Josh, can we not do this right now?

12:48.659 --> 12:51.294
Yes! Okay, look, it's totally cool.

12:51.329 --> 12:52.295
Just wanna make sure you're okay.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.663
I'm okay.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.498
Good.

12:55.550 --> 12:57.584
So, talking to Cam was pretty tough, h?

12:57.635 --> 12:59.502
- Yeah!
- I knew it!

12:59.554 --> 13:01.338
See?! I'm not jealous!

13:01.340 --> 13:03.423
I'm not a liar, Cam's
a cheater, I was right!

13:03.474 --> 13:08.345
♪ Josh was right, right r-r-r-right,
right ♪ (Imitates DJ sounds)

13:08.396 --> 13:10.597
Stop it!

13:10.648 --> 13:11.648
You're not right!

13:11.682 --> 13:13.183
Pretty sure I am.

13:13.234 --> 13:15.518
No! You're not! Okay?

13:15.520 --> 13:18.655
That woman that you saw him with, uh...

13:18.689 --> 13:21.191
Is his sister.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.526
What?

13:23.578 --> 13:26.363
Yeah, oh, let me ask you
something, tech genius.

13:26.365 --> 13:27.581
Did the woman you saw him with look...

13:27.615 --> 13:31.451
Did she, uh... Did she
look anything like this?

13:31.502 --> 13:34.337
Little bit.

13:34.372 --> 13:38.341
And you honestly think I would be taking a
selfie with Cam and his secret girlfriend?

13:40.628 --> 13:43.463
Probably not.

13:43.514 --> 13:45.599
So then I was right, but, you know what?

13:45.633 --> 13:48.268
I really don't feel the need
to throw it in your face.

13:48.302 --> 13:49.552
I actually wanna thank you.

13:49.604 --> 13:54.224
Because of you, Cam and I ended up
having a really intimate conversation.

13:54.275 --> 13:59.529
And he revealed things to me about
himself that I just could not believe.

13:59.563 --> 14:02.232
And, uh, it actually brought us closer.

14:02.283 --> 14:05.568
So close, that he's comingr
to my house for dinner tonight.

14:05.570 --> 14:08.538
And you're looking at the menu.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:17.632 --> 14:19.582
What's up, bro-hymes?

14:19.634 --> 14:22.302
Let's talk code and get or V-game on!

14:22.336 --> 14:24.554
Hashtag bro-down!

14:24.588 --> 14:26.690
Elliott, what the hell are you wearing?

14:26.724 --> 14:32.429
Just my fave hoodie and cargo pants with
lots of pockets for all my man stuff.

14:34.265 --> 14:36.516
God, where's my tinted chapstick?

14:37.652 --> 14:39.352
(Elevator dings)

14:42.606 --> 14:46.276
You're young, skinny, and... get out!

14:47.662 --> 14:50.497
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be
rude, but I'm looking for a man.

14:50.531 --> 14:53.283
And I don't need the competition.

14:53.334 --> 14:56.619
You don't have to worry about me
I got my hands full raising my son.

14:56.621 --> 14:59.589
Oh, is he single? And how old is he?

14:59.623 --> 15:00.623
(Both laugh)

15:00.675 --> 15:02.292
He's 17.

15:02.294 --> 15:07.297
- Oh!
- Oh, and he is a heartbreaker!

15:07.299 --> 15:09.382
Oh, my damn!

15:09.433 --> 15:11.601
Right?

15:11.635 --> 15:13.603
This one's gonna give me trouble.

15:13.637 --> 15:15.605
(Laughs) Yes, he is.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.643
Josh, I need to talk to you.

15:20.695 --> 15:22.195
I'm playing.

15:22.229 --> 15:24.447
I'm not! Right now!

15:24.482 --> 15:25.565
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

15:25.616 --> 15:28.485
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

15:28.487 --> 15:29.486
What?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.621
Cam is 17!

15:31.655 --> 15:34.541
What?!

15:34.575 --> 15:37.460
Like "can't drink", "can't vote",
"can't wait to hop on Gabi!"

15:37.495 --> 15:39.295
I gotta call her.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.498
Hurry please, those
17-yeared-olds go fast!

15:44.502 --> 15:47.303
She's not answering. Elliot,
watch my guests, I gotta take off.

15:47.338 --> 15:50.557
No! I just got here!

15:54.478 --> 15:55.512
Where you going?

15:55.514 --> 15:56.679
Gabi is about to sleep with a minor.

15:56.731 --> 15:59.349
So?

16:01.402 --> 16:02.435
So?

16:02.486 --> 16:05.605
How come everything's always about Gabi?

16:05.656 --> 16:09.409
Ever since she started working
here, you never have time for me.

16:12.531 --> 16:14.364
Elliot, is this why you
wanted to come to my party?

16:14.366 --> 16:16.499
It just seems like you
like her more than me.

16:16.534 --> 16:19.452
Hey, you've been around forever.

16:19.503 --> 16:22.372
When I started this
business, you were there.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.207
We're a team.

16:24.258 --> 16:26.259
So, you're saying...

16:26.293 --> 16:29.295
I'm the wind beneath your wings?

16:30.548 --> 16:32.382
You took the words right out of my mouth.

16:32.384 --> 16:34.300
(Elevator dings)

16:34.351 --> 16:35.468
And, Elliot...

16:35.519 --> 16:36.553
Lose the hoodie.

16:40.274 --> 16:41.441
Ah!

16:44.361 --> 16:46.563
(Cell phone ringing)

16:46.565 --> 16:49.282
Ah... it's Josh, again!

16:49.316 --> 16:52.285
Doesn't he know you're having fake
sex with your underage boyfriend?

16:53.704 --> 16:55.488
You know, this is all your fault.

16:55.539 --> 16:58.241
"Gabi, get back out
there". "Gabi, be a taxi".

17:00.294 --> 17:03.329
Yeah, a taxi, not a school bus.

17:04.415 --> 17:06.583
Okay, all you have to do is tell Josh

17:06.617 --> 17:09.636
that you and Cam had an amazing
sex-a-thon and then broke up.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.387
No harm, no statutory.

17:11.422 --> 17:12.422
(Banging on door)

17:12.424 --> 17:13.556
<i>Gabi!</i>

17:13.590 --> 17:15.224
<i>Gabi, open up!</i>

17:15.259 --> 17:16.593
Oh, my God! It's Josh!
He's here and Cam isn't,

17:16.644 --> 17:17.644
he's gonna know I'm lying.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.561
<i>- Um...
- (Banging on door)</i>

17:19.597 --> 17:22.265
<i>Gabi, I need to talk to you.</i>

17:22.316 --> 17:25.234
You gotta be Cam.

17:25.269 --> 17:26.402
Let's do this, woman.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.520
Okay.

17:29.356 --> 17:32.192
(Banging on door)

17:32.243 --> 17:33.610
Hey Josh.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.361
Sorry it took me so
long to get to the door.

17:35.412 --> 17:37.447
I was having amazing
sex over and over again.

17:40.284 --> 17:43.503
<i>Yo, Gabi, I need pizza,
I worked up an appetite.</i>

17:43.537 --> 17:46.539
Agh!

17:46.590 --> 17:47.624
I'm too late!

17:47.675 --> 17:51.261
- Too late for what?
- He's 17!

17:51.295 --> 17:52.629
Look, I'll get you a
good lawyer, hopefully...

17:52.631 --> 17:54.264
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

17:54.298 --> 17:55.632
You don't have to do that.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.634
I know that he's 17.

18:03.524 --> 18:06.643
- You do?
- Yeah. Oh, and he's not here.

18:06.645 --> 18:10.146
<i>Babe, still waiting on that pizza.</i>

18:11.699 --> 18:13.566
He knows, Sofia!

18:13.617 --> 18:15.368
<i>Oh.</i>

18:17.488 --> 18:21.324
Look, when I found out Cam
was 17, I broke it off with him.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.293
So why did you tell me
you guys were hooking up?

18:23.327 --> 18:27.247
Because I couldn't take
your obnoxious gloating.

18:27.298 --> 18:28.331
Well, look...

18:28.382 --> 18:30.500
If I wasn't right all the time...

18:30.551 --> 18:33.503
I wouldn't gloat... Oh, wow, I hear it.

18:35.673 --> 18:38.224
I'm sorry things didn't
work out with you and Cam.

18:38.259 --> 18:41.227
It's okay, he wasn't my
soul mate or anything,

18:41.262 --> 18:44.397
I was just kinda hoping
that he'd help me move on.

18:44.431 --> 18:46.516
Move from...?

18:46.518 --> 18:48.518
Move on from...

18:48.520 --> 18:50.186
You.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.624
Just, uh... grabbing my pizza.

18:56.493 --> 18:59.445
All that fake sex really made me hungry.

19:06.203 --> 19:08.171
I didn't know there was a "me"
you needed to move on from.

19:08.205 --> 19:09.505
There isn't.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.292
There isn't, I think I
just got a little confused.

19:12.343 --> 19:15.511
You have to admit our situation
was kinda weird, I mean...

19:15.546 --> 19:17.213
What are we?

19:17.215 --> 19:20.216
Friends? Boss/employee?
One-time, drunken hookup?

19:21.685 --> 19:23.386
All of the above?

19:24.555 --> 19:27.557
I just wish we hadn't slept together,
you know, it'd be so much easier.

19:27.559 --> 19:31.361
I agree.

19:31.395 --> 19:33.613
Look, that night Caroline
broke up with me, I was a mess.

19:33.647 --> 19:36.232
I needed someone and you were there.

19:36.283 --> 19:39.235
I didn't really mean to
be there quite that way.

19:41.238 --> 19:45.541
I don't think either of
us did, but... it happened.

19:45.576 --> 19:49.329
And, hey, now that we're talking about
it, maybe we can finally move forward.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.413
Yeah, I'd like that.

19:52.249 --> 19:54.217
But that doesn't mean I'm gonna
stop meddling around your life.

19:54.251 --> 19:56.219
'Cause you have to admit, it kinda helped.

19:56.253 --> 19:59.589
Okay, I'll admit that, if
you admit you were jealous.

20:01.675 --> 20:04.644
It might have crossed my mind, as I
left my own party to drive across town

20:04.678 --> 20:06.396
to stop you from having sex.

20:08.599 --> 20:11.401
But what I really think it is, is...

20:11.435 --> 20:13.269
That I'm protective of you.

20:13.271 --> 20:17.407
<i>Sofia: Protective 'cause you're jealous!</i>

20:17.441 --> 20:20.243
Protective because I care.

20:20.277 --> 20:23.329
And as long as you work for me,
and as long as we're friends,

20:23.364 --> 20:24.447
I'm gonna watch out for ya.

20:24.498 --> 20:25.481
I can't help that.

20:27.334 --> 20:28.501
I can deal with that.

20:32.589 --> 20:35.508
Ah, I should probably go.

20:35.542 --> 20:36.626
Yeah.

20:39.296 --> 20:40.463
Good night, Gabi...

20:41.515 --> 20:42.598
Good night, Josh.

20:44.601 --> 20:46.352
<i>Go!</i>

20:49.473 --> 20:53.352
You've got to turn your
taxi light on, baby!

20:54.243 --> 20:57.495
And let the world know you
are single and ready to mingle!

20:57.546 --> 20:59.047
(Elevator dings)

21:00.416 --> 21:02.167
Hey!

21:03.219 --> 21:04.335
Wow...

21:04.386 --> 21:06.337
That blouse...

21:06.388 --> 21:08.139
Did you ever consider
untucking and belting?

21:08.174 --> 21:10.308
Oh, my God!

21:12.194 --> 21:15.430
I was thinking that all day!

21:15.432 --> 21:17.398
I'm waiter, you going down?

21:17.433 --> 21:19.267
Fingers crossed.
