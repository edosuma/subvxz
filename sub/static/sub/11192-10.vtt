WEBVTT

00:16.300 --> 00:18.376
Now! Stop.

00:24.178 --> 00:26.254
Charge.

00:30.376 --> 00:32.664
First lock engaged.

00:32.655 --> 00:34.779
Revolve.

00:53.609 --> 00:56.609
We're supposed to be at that
physical assessment thing.

00:56.569 --> 00:59.485
Oh, yeah. I'll go. I'll just...

00:59.968 --> 01:02.802
Just let me finish this reel.

01:03.445 --> 01:05.853
You seem a tad obsessed with this stuff.

01:05.846 --> 01:09.296
This was transferred from film
of experiments on the gate in 1945.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.245
- You don't find that at all intriguing?
- Oh, yeah.

01:12.204 --> 01:15.159
Nothing piques my interest
more than repeated failure.

01:15.123 --> 01:20.793
Look at them. They're turning the gate
manually, for God's sake. It's incredible.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.402
- How many hours have you seen?
- There's no conclusion.

01:24.359 --> 01:28.902
There's no summary. No notes.
No reason to explain why they gave up.

01:28.799 --> 01:32.796
- Boxes of material may be missing.
- The Pentagon said this was everything.

01:32.718 --> 01:36.502
Oh, please. The Pentagon's
lost entire countries.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.753
Come on.

01:38.757 --> 01:43.502
The doctors have two days of tests
planned for us. Wonderful tests.

01:46.514 --> 01:48.921
Uh, Jack.

02:00.629 --> 02:02.789
That's impossible.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.912
Obviously not.

02:05.269 --> 02:09.217
This doesn't make any sense.
Why wouldn't someone have told us this?

02:09.145 --> 02:14.057
Why would they stop their research if
they'd actually managed to turn it on?

02:37.378 --> 02:39.170
Holy cow.

03:50.478 --> 03:52.554
Hello, Martha.

03:54.518 --> 03:57.683
There's a young man waiting
for you in the kitchen.

03:57.635 --> 04:00.341
You let a strange young man
into the house?

04:00.316 --> 04:03.899
Yes. I'm sorry. He said he knows you.

04:06.715 --> 04:08.790
My God!

04:09.712 --> 04:12.548
Hello. I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind.

04:12.512 --> 04:15.181
How long have you been back?

04:15.151 --> 04:16.860
Oh.

04:16.870 --> 04:21.781
My God, why are you back? Colonel
O'Neill said you stayed on Abydos.

04:21.670 --> 04:24.586
I see you got the amulet.

04:24.548 --> 04:27.300
Yes, of course. I never take it off.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.435
Why avoid my question?
What's this all about?

04:39.784 --> 04:43.995
Colonel O'Neill, Dr. Jackson was supposed
to be briefing SG-4 this morning.

04:43.903 --> 04:48.564
He's not here and he's not answering
our pages. Any idea where he is?

04:48.461 --> 04:51.379
I haven't seen him in a while, sir.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.658
- Catherine, I couldn't tell you.
- Why not?

04:55.620 --> 04:59.783
They wouldn't let me.
Everything is classified. You know.

05:00.858 --> 05:03.230
When did you become
an upstanding military man?

05:03.218 --> 05:07.843
I'm not... exactly. And that's why I'm here.

05:07.737 --> 05:12.694
I'll make you some tea, then you
can go back to your Stargate Command.

05:12.774 --> 05:17.935
Thousands of Stargates. Planetary shifts.
Didn't anyone think I might be interested?

05:17.812 --> 05:20.185
- That's why I came.
- Now, six months later.

05:20.173 --> 05:22.877
- You could have told me sooner.
- Yes.

05:22.851 --> 05:27.680
Just like you could have told me there
were experiments on the gate in 1945.

05:35.569 --> 05:40.444
My father headed up a research team
that worked on the gate during the war.

05:40.326 --> 05:43.529
<i>Actually, they didn't know
what it was then.</i>

05:43.485 --> 05:46.403
President Roosevelt was like that.
Curious.

05:46.365 --> 05:50.279
They suspected the gate was a weapon,
or could be used as one.

05:50.204 --> 05:52.279
Nothing ever came of it.
How do you know?

05:52.283 --> 05:54.608
The Pentagon is
declassifying old material.

05:54.603 --> 05:59.846
They found file boxes that dealt with the
old experiments and they sent them to us.

05:59.721 --> 06:00.966
Really?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.622
You weren't involved in the research?

06:03.600 --> 06:07.812
The military had very little use
for a 21-year-old girl at that time.

06:07.718 --> 06:09.093
Neither did my father.

06:09.119 --> 06:13.863
I only know what little I overheard
him and Ernest talking about.

06:13.757 --> 06:16.081
I'm sorry, who's... Ernest?

06:23.074 --> 06:27.403
You get as far as entering the fifth symbol,
then the whole room starts to shake.

06:27.314 --> 06:30.848
Today one of the generators
exploded from the feedback.

06:30.792 --> 06:34.540
- Are you going to talk to my father?
- He knows. He was there.

06:34.471 --> 06:37.341
I meant about us.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.507
Oh.

06:40.988 --> 06:43.562
Yes, I will.

06:43.548 --> 06:46.418
- Maybe it's supposed to do that.
- What?

06:46.387 --> 06:49.341
The ring. Maybe it's supposed to shake.

06:50.146 --> 06:51.937
I don't think so.

06:51.947 --> 06:55.694
Are you using alternating
or direct current to charge it?

06:56.545 --> 07:00.245
- Alternating, I think. Why?
- Try using direct.

07:00.184 --> 07:04.810
It might prevent the charge
from bouncing back to the generator.

07:05.983 --> 07:08.769
<i>And you should talk to my father.</i>

07:09.661 --> 07:12.365
I will. I promise.

07:20.776 --> 07:24.988
You didn't know the government kept
the files from the original experiments?

07:24.896 --> 07:29.024
I had my father's notes. He told
me that was everything they had.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.362
You know how many administrations
I had to petition

07:33.334 --> 07:37.167
to get this programme started up again?
40 years had passed.

07:37.093 --> 07:40.011
Information was classified and buried.

07:39.971 --> 07:43.471
I never asked for any files
because I thought I had them.

07:43.411 --> 07:47.492
General West never offered because
he probably didn't know they existed.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.949
So...

07:49.930 --> 07:54.009
you don't know that they
turned the gate on in 1945.

07:53.927 --> 07:56.004
What?

07:58.606 --> 08:01.478
There must be over
a hundred million combinations.

08:01.447 --> 08:07.069
If it's merely a combination lock used to
turn it on, why 39 symbols? Why not six?

08:06.925 --> 08:10.293
- What are you saying?
- They're not combinations.

08:10.242 --> 08:13.279
They're destinations.
And we just found one.

08:14.721 --> 08:18.257
A doorway to heaven can mean
any number of different things.

08:18.201 --> 08:22.579
It could simply mean that anyone
who passes through there will die.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.315
For example...

08:30.997 --> 08:35.162
- Catherine, we have a maid for a reason.
- I wanted to do it.

08:52.272 --> 08:55.273
No. I never knew they turned it on.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.980
My father never told me.

08:58.950 --> 09:01.868
It wasn't in his notes, either.

09:02.948 --> 09:06.365
Then there's something more
you should see.

09:11.745 --> 09:13.822
Here, watch this.

09:19.744 --> 09:21.820
Oh, God.

09:32.259 --> 09:34.965
There was an accident today.

09:36.739 --> 09:39.193
An explosion in the lab.

09:39.177 --> 09:40.423
Ernest?

09:41.817 --> 09:43.894
I'm so sorry.

09:49.774 --> 09:52.811
So the man who went
through the gate is Ernest.

09:53.374 --> 09:55.912
Yes.

09:55.893 --> 09:58.644
My father must have lied to me.

09:58.611 --> 10:01.696
He said Ernest died in an accident.

10:01.652 --> 10:04.024
An explosion.

10:04.010 --> 10:06.298
Why would he do that?

10:06.289 --> 10:09.493
- Probably thought he was protecting me.
- From what?

10:09.448 --> 10:15.035
From knowing that the man I was
supposed to marry chose to risk his life

10:14.888 --> 10:19.798
and go through the Stargate,
without even talking to me about it.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.703
He chose his idea, his work, over me.

10:24.046 --> 10:27.878
Well, I'm sure that he believed
he would... he would come back.

10:28.244 --> 10:30.615
He was so young.

10:30.602 --> 10:33.307
So full of passion.

10:34.481 --> 10:38.527
Like you. You reminded me
of him when I first saw you.

10:38.961 --> 10:43.124
That's why I knew you'd solve
the mysteries of the gate.

10:47.038 --> 10:49.280
Catherine...

10:52.476 --> 10:55.394
I wasn't supposed to show you this.

10:56.355 --> 11:00.306
Actually, I wasn't supposed
to show you any of this, but now...

11:01.354 --> 11:04.474
Computer enhancements
from the film footage.

11:05.393 --> 11:10.054
I isolated the chevrons that were locked in
before Ernest went through.

11:09.951 --> 11:11.066
Not Abydos?

11:11.111 --> 11:14.149
No. Another planet
with similar coordinates.

11:14.711 --> 11:17.416
And we can go there.

11:21.509 --> 11:23.585
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

11:23.587 --> 11:27.336
Who authorised you to reveal
classified information to a civilian?

11:27.265 --> 11:31.311
- Sir, if you will let me explain...
- This is a serious breach of protocol.

11:31.225 --> 11:34.510
The rules exist for a reason.
Do you think you're above them?

11:34.465 --> 11:36.836
- No! No, I...
- Catherine.

11:39.104 --> 11:42.602
- Hello, Jack.
- It's good to see you again.

11:42.542 --> 11:45.745
I trust the general is making
you feel right at home.

11:45.701 --> 11:48.322
So far he actually sounds
worse than General West.

11:48.301 --> 11:50.210
Ah, he's a teddy bear.

11:50.220 --> 11:54.596
Did you authorise Dr. Jackson to reveal
classified information to this civilian?

11:54.499 --> 11:59.076
Absolutely not, sir. In fact,
I advised him not to say anything to her,

11:58.977 --> 12:01.350
even though she used
to run the programme

12:01.336 --> 12:05.287
and is responsible for most
of our current knowledge about the gate.

12:05.216 --> 12:08.633
- I'm aware of who she is, Colonel.
- Catherine, this is Teal'c.

12:08.576 --> 12:11.114
Teal'c, this is Catherine.

12:11.095 --> 12:14.345
Daniel's told me all about you.
Such a pleasure.

12:17.173 --> 12:23.259
Colonel, are you aware of the request
Dr. Jackson has most currently tabled?

12:27.250 --> 12:30.534
You gotta go that one step
further, don't you?

12:30.489 --> 12:34.568
The man who went through the gate
in 1945 was Catherine's fiancÃ©.

12:36.006 --> 12:40.219
Now, I have the address of the planet
he went to, and we can go there.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.772
And I'm coming with you.

12:44.323 --> 12:47.159
General, we know where
Ernest Littlefield went.

12:47.124 --> 12:50.990
He could still be alive - a man with the
vision to see the gate for what it was

12:50.923 --> 12:53.129
a half a century before anyone else.

12:53.121 --> 12:56.822
He sounds like a bona fide
American hero, sir.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.570
Sir, there may be another reason to go.

12:59.559 --> 13:02.230
- Samantha!
- Catherine!

13:02.198 --> 13:03.278
Captain Carter.

13:03.320 --> 13:07.863
Yes, sir. It seems the planet
in question is close to Abydos,

13:07.758 --> 13:10.629
so it uses many of the same points
in space as locators.

13:10.596 --> 13:16.716
That's why the team in '45 could dial in
without compensating for planetary shift.

13:16.554 --> 13:21.097
But, sir, the planet in question is not
on the cartouche we found on Abydos.

13:20.994 --> 13:24.278
- What's the significance?
- The Goa'ulds haven't charted it.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.356
They may not even have been there.

13:26.352 --> 13:30.220
If the Goa'ulds haven't been to this planet,
and there is a gate there,

13:30.150 --> 13:33.851
we would have proof that they didn't
originally build the Stargate.

13:33.790 --> 13:37.835
The Goa'uld are scavengers. Since
they have not travelled to this planet,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.834
we may find technologies
we can use against them.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.067
You speak?

13:43.067 --> 13:45.524
When it is appropriate.

13:47.626 --> 13:52.787
Thank you. Thank all of you for your
very thorough analysis of the situation.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.828
But I was already convinced
by Dr. Jackson's initial argument.

13:56.744 --> 14:02.118
Ernest Littlefield could still be alive,
and we should try to find him.

14:45.649 --> 14:48.139
It's a piece of cake.

14:52.008 --> 14:54.130
- Ready?
- And...

15:18.400 --> 15:22.563
- You OK?
- Huh! That was some piece of cake.

15:30.517 --> 15:33.008
- It's hot in here.
- Oh, yeah.

15:46.672 --> 15:49.590
Anybody see a way in
or out of this place?

15:49.951 --> 15:52.951
There appears to be only two doorways.

15:59.908 --> 16:01.985
Oh, my!

16:14.464 --> 16:17.168
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

16:19.342 --> 16:21.631
Dr. Littlefield?

16:22.023 --> 16:23.136
Ernest?

16:37.418 --> 16:42.245
Hello. I'm Daniel Jackson.
We just came through the Stargate.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.415
Yes... uh, that thing. The... Stargate.

16:50.095 --> 16:52.171
We're real.

16:57.251 --> 16:59.539
It's... about... time.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.165
Oh, boy.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.161
Daniel, do something.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.242
Uh, Dr. Littlefield?

17:32.520 --> 17:35.095
You don't recognise me.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.551
Ca... Catherine?

17:43.878 --> 17:46.286
Hm.

17:49.116 --> 17:52.284
50 years... That's all he has to say!

17:53.435 --> 17:56.306
I'll... I'll go... see if I can find him.

18:36.702 --> 18:38.778
<i>Still here?</i>

18:41.461 --> 18:43.787
Uh...

18:43.780 --> 18:47.150
do you have anything to wear? Clothes?

18:47.099 --> 18:49.175
Oh, uh, uh...

18:50.059 --> 18:52.098
going home.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.804
Yes, we're taking you home.

18:59.016 --> 19:01.685
So much time.

19:01.655 --> 19:04.230
Did... no one try again?

19:04.215 --> 19:06.540
That's a long story.

19:08.374 --> 19:11.125
Are there other people here?

19:15.092 --> 19:17.797
No one else lives here?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.487
How about nearby?

19:30.768 --> 19:35.144
Are you saying that you've been
completely alone here for 50 years?

19:37.806 --> 19:39.882
Eat.

19:46.482 --> 19:49.519
I don't know what I expected.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.482
I mean, I can't believe he's right here.

19:52.921 --> 19:56.171
Light years away
but still so close, all this time.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.760
Alive.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.335
I think he's probably having
a little trouble dealing with it too.

20:01.278 --> 20:06.025
I felt like a schoolgirl. My heart beat
faster than when I came through the gate.

20:05.917 --> 20:11.457
- You think you're old and wise.
- I don't think the heart ever grows old.

20:12.875 --> 20:16.161
I can't even fathom
what he's been through.

20:16.753 --> 20:20.288
Such a long time.
I don't even know that man!

20:25.632 --> 20:28.548
Why don't you go and talk to him?

20:32.191 --> 20:34.267
Last day.

20:34.829 --> 20:37.117
It's a calendar, isn't it?

20:46.185 --> 20:50.314
Have you figured out who built this place
or who used to live here?

20:50.224 --> 20:52.300
Heliopolis.

20:53.023 --> 20:54.055
Heliopolis.

20:54.104 --> 20:58.054
Repository. Philosophy. Astronomy.

20:58.262 --> 21:02.391
The ancient Egyptian city. People
came from everywhere to gather there.

21:02.300 --> 21:08.089
Scholars, community leaders. It was
also the central place of worship for Ra.

21:08.818 --> 21:12.104
Are there Ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphs here?

21:12.058 --> 21:15.723
Symbols that indicate Ra?
This could be very important.

21:28.814 --> 21:29.845
"Four languages."

21:29.893 --> 21:33.724
"Writing is like none on Earth.
Catherine says they're probably alien."

21:33.653 --> 21:38.113
- "Catherine says"?
- She found me long ago.

21:41.730 --> 21:45.644
"We walked for miles today,
and still found no signs of civilisation."

21:45.568 --> 21:48.403
"Catherine seems concerned
but I am not."

21:48.367 --> 21:51.867
"As long as she is here with me
I will never feel alone."

21:53.047 --> 21:58.041
"It seems impossible but every day
we're here together I love her more."

21:58.965 --> 22:01.671
My father lied to me.

22:04.522 --> 22:05.603
Oh...

22:05.643 --> 22:07.551
Uh...

22:07.563 --> 22:10.054
I'll leave you two.

22:14.881 --> 22:17.205
So... real!

22:18.080 --> 22:19.788
Yes.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.670
You're going to have to believe.

22:22.637 --> 22:25.343
This isn't easy for me either.

22:25.557 --> 22:29.886
You... you look, um... different.

22:29.796 --> 22:33.461
I'm old, Ernest. So are you.

22:33.994 --> 22:37.079
We... we had a wonderful life together.

22:37.993 --> 22:40.865
I couldn't imagine you, Ernest.

22:40.833 --> 22:45.328
In my mind, we didn't have a wonderful
life. I thought you were dead.

22:46.631 --> 22:50.580
Forgave me. You forgave me long ago.

22:51.190 --> 22:53.347
No. I didn't.

22:54.308 --> 22:56.384
Oh.

23:07.145 --> 23:10.063
Doesn't seem to be anybody else around.

23:10.585 --> 23:12.991
This place used to be pretty sweet

23:12.983 --> 23:15.938
but it's seen better days,
if you know what I mean.

23:15.903 --> 23:20.030
I think Professor Littlefield
has been alone since he got here.

23:20.862 --> 23:22.142
Wow.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.550
- A storm approaches.
- And a pretty big one at that.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.417
- It comes every year.
- Every year?

23:30.378 --> 23:33.582
Yeah, look, kids. We're right
on the edge of a cliff here.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.909
This place can't withstand another big hit.

23:35.897 --> 23:38.056
- We should take our leave.
- No, we can't.

23:38.057 --> 23:40.679
Not yet. We've only begun
to explore this place,

23:40.655 --> 23:43.230
figure out what it is, what it used to be.

23:43.215 --> 23:47.426
We launched a survey balloon. Now let's
take the professor and Catherine home.

23:47.335 --> 23:50.786
We'll leave the probe here
until the storm blows over

23:50.732 --> 23:55.061
- And then we'll come back. All right?
- I tried for years to make it work.

23:54.971 --> 23:59.300
You never tried entering
different glyphs in this thing?

24:06.567 --> 24:08.893
We call this the dial-home device.

24:08.887 --> 24:12.304
Basically, you enter
the correct address and...

24:12.247 --> 24:14.738
Daniel, why don't we just show him?

24:21.444 --> 24:23.935
- My God.
- What the hell...?

24:26.522 --> 24:29.440
The probe was supposed
to detect stuff like this.

24:29.402 --> 24:34.989
We got visual confirmation of its presence
but the damage was obviously concealed.

24:43.317 --> 24:46.438
- It's not working.
- It was like that when I got here.

24:46.396 --> 24:49.102
That's why you never came back.

24:51.275 --> 24:53.980
Does this mean we're not going home?

25:19.467 --> 25:22.965
Since we're going to be here a while,
I'd like you to see something.

25:22.905 --> 25:24.105
<i>What?</i>

25:24.145 --> 25:28.724
Come on. It's the safest room there is,
you know. Especially in a storm.

25:31.624 --> 25:34.292
Give me your hand. Thanks.

25:36.342 --> 25:38.667
Keep at it. We'll be back.

25:54.136 --> 25:57.007
What is this place?

26:00.615 --> 26:04.992
"I believe this room is some sort of
meeting place where four alien races -

26:04.894 --> 26:09.556
denoted by the symbols and distinctive
writing on the walls - would gather,

26:09.453 --> 26:15.076
to share knowledge or discuss relations,
like a 'United Nations of the stars'."

26:14.931 --> 26:16.805
"Catherine agrees."

26:16.810 --> 26:19.516
You're right. I would have.

26:24.367 --> 26:28.946
All roads seem to lead here, which
means this is likely the power source.

26:29.846 --> 26:32.219
I believe you are correct.

26:32.205 --> 26:35.740
It could take years to work out how
to put the crystals back properly

26:35.685 --> 26:37.808
but we might be able
to figure out a way

26:37.805 --> 26:42.300
to rig the power source directly
to the gate and then dial in manually.

26:45.843 --> 26:47.965
This looks familiar.

26:47.961 --> 26:50.038
Touch it.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.978
Whoa!

27:04.876 --> 27:06.288
It's beautiful!

27:06.317 --> 27:09.603
Daniel? Does this... mean anything?

27:10.115 --> 27:12.986
Well, if this was a Mecca of sorts -

27:12.954 --> 27:16.371
an "alien United Nations" -
this has to mean something.

27:18.874 --> 27:21.992
- I know this.
- Of course. High-school chemistry.

27:22.832 --> 27:25.074
One proton. One electron.

27:25.070 --> 27:27.644
<i>- Hydrogen.
- Beryllium.</i>

27:27.631 --> 27:30.086
- Sodium.
- Silver. Iron.

27:30.749 --> 27:33.204
Barium. Xenon.

27:33.188 --> 27:36.473
Oh, my God. So many electrons.
How can you tell?

27:36.429 --> 27:39.512
I've been here a very
long time, remember?

27:40.947 --> 27:42.404
Excuse me.

27:42.426 --> 27:47.634
Are you saying that all
of these are atomic... things?

27:47.505 --> 27:50.506
The images are graphic
representations of the elements.

27:50.462 --> 27:54.542
Electrons revolve around a proton. The
number of them indicates the element.

27:54.462 --> 27:56.289
146.

27:56.302 --> 27:59.672
There are currently only 111 elements
on the periodic table.

27:59.621 --> 28:01.696
Only 90 when I last looked.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.608
This is incredible.

28:03.619 --> 28:08.365
We've only been able to speculate on
the appearance and structure of an atom.

28:08.259 --> 28:10.465
The fact that four
completely alien races

28:10.458 --> 28:14.670
chose to represent it visually
in an almost identical way...

28:14.576 --> 28:19.487
The basic elements are what make up the
universe. They're the basic building blo...

28:19.375 --> 28:23.954
Of course! How do you ensure
universal communication?

28:25.292 --> 28:31.047
You reduce the method of communication
to basic elements common to everyone.

28:30.892 --> 28:34.723
Jack, this is a true universal language.

28:40.128 --> 28:41.955
- Turn the page.
- What?

28:41.969 --> 28:43.344
Turn the page.

28:47.048 --> 28:50.084
Are you saying that this...
this is like a book?

28:50.886 --> 28:56.307
- I tried to read it. I tried to understand.
- 146 elements. Letters or word symbols.

28:56.164 --> 29:00.210
If they're letters, if they're pictographic,
this could take a lifetime.

29:00.124 --> 29:02.200
- More.
- Oh.

29:02.804 --> 29:04.843
Sorry.

29:04.843 --> 29:08.971
Daniel, before your head explodes,

29:08.882 --> 29:11.752
can I remind you we have
more important things to do?

29:11.721 --> 29:14.805
How can you say that?
Don't you know what this could mean?

29:14.759 --> 29:16.633
Actually, no.

29:16.638 --> 29:20.221
This could be the key
to understanding our existence.

29:20.157 --> 29:23.491
Everyone, everything's existence.

29:23.436 --> 29:28.313
The collaboration of the knowledge
of these four alien species.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.809
None of which will mean squat
if we don't get out of here.

29:54.948 --> 29:56.573
<i>How's it goin'?</i>

29:56.587 --> 30:00.917
We're trying to connect the power source
from the dial-home device into the gate.

30:00.826 --> 30:03.530
I'm about to run a test. Where's Daniel?

30:03.506 --> 30:07.171
- Oh, Ernest was showing him a new toy.
- Really? What?

30:07.105 --> 30:11.932
A fancy light show that may be the key
to our existence, or something like that.

30:16.861 --> 30:20.028
Uh, you wanna pick up the pace
on this a little bit?

30:32.777 --> 30:34.604
You did it!

30:42.055 --> 30:43.596
Get back!

31:22.682 --> 31:24.509
This is how you knew what this was.

31:24.521 --> 31:27.972
- Then you recognise it too.
- Othala, the Norse rune,

31:27.921 --> 31:31.752
thought to represent numinous power
and knowledge from past generations.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.346
And the gathering of clans
to share a common interest.

31:36.079 --> 31:39.246
You know, there's more
than just a coincidence here.

31:39.198 --> 31:44.820
But that means that humans were here...
centuries, maybe aeons ago.

31:44.676 --> 31:48.376
Not humans, aliens. This is Thor's race.

31:48.315 --> 31:50.936
Thor was an alien?

31:50.914 --> 31:55.541
Oh, yeah. That's, uh...
that's another long story.

31:55.432 --> 31:58.137
But a... good one.

32:02.551 --> 32:07.462
All right, basic survival training. We
know what we have. What do we need?

32:10.788 --> 32:14.123
We have the Stargate.
We need the dial-home device.

32:15.347 --> 32:16.972
Thank you, Teal'c.

32:16.987 --> 32:20.736
The element the gate is made up of
absorbs energy directly.

32:20.664 --> 32:25.873
Internal functions will convert and store
that energy in capacitor-like reservoirs

32:25.744 --> 32:30.123
but the inside wheel will only unlock and
spin once there's enough reserve power.

32:30.023 --> 32:32.729
So what we need is energy.

32:35.941 --> 32:38.858
I don't see any electrical outlets, do you?

32:52.936 --> 32:56.685
This is useless. It's not allowing
for any relative perspective.

32:56.615 --> 33:00.031
How did you incorporate
the 3D nature of the information?

32:59.974 --> 33:01.932
Look down.

33:06.413 --> 33:11.453
Of course. You measured the element's
distance from a central point,

33:11.332 --> 33:15.329
degrees from zero round in a circle,
and height above the floor.

33:23.647 --> 33:27.098
- What's up, guys?
- Step away from the pedestal, Daniel.

33:27.047 --> 33:30.166
What? Why?

33:30.125 --> 33:34.538
The dial-home device just fell
through the floor into the ocean.

33:34.443 --> 33:36.270
So what are we going to do?

33:36.284 --> 33:40.031
That thing may have a power source
that we can use to get the gate working.

33:39.962 --> 33:42.584
Uh... no.

33:42.561 --> 33:46.394
You don't understand. This book
may contain knowledge of the universe.

33:46.322 --> 33:49.073
This is... meaning-of-life stuff.

33:49.201 --> 33:54.194
I have to get more of it on paper. There
has to be something more you can use.

33:54.079 --> 33:56.832
- What about Teal'c's staff?
- Not powerful enough.

33:56.798 --> 33:59.372
There's not much time.
We have to get inside it.

33:59.357 --> 34:04.814
The whole place could join the DHD at the
bottom of the ocean any minute. Please...

34:08.594 --> 34:10.054
Great.

34:10.074 --> 34:12.150
Shoot it.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.784
Now what?

34:43.585 --> 34:50.750
I'm obviously no scientist but, uh...
couldn't we use that Ben Franklin thing?

34:52.181 --> 34:54.554
The gate is made of a superconductor.

34:54.541 --> 34:58.039
It'll absorb energy in many forms -
heat, nuclear, solar, static.

34:57.981 --> 35:03.521
If we could channel a lightning strike into
the gate, it might give us enough power.

35:03.380 --> 35:05.206
How do we attract lightning to it?

35:05.217 --> 35:07.626
Not directly. We'll have
to rig something up

35:07.619 --> 35:12.530
and hope a sudden and enormous charge
doesn't destroy the gate's mechanisms.

35:20.655 --> 35:22.777
We got it, Teal'c!

35:33.570 --> 35:36.737
Daniel won't come up.
He's obsessed with that thing.

35:36.690 --> 35:40.983
- So much like you used to be.
- The torment of Tantalus.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.139
- What?
- Tantalus was a king in Greek mythology,

35:44.086 --> 35:49.791
banished to Hades, forced to stand in
water that receded when he tried to drink.

35:49.646 --> 35:52.599
Everlasting, unending temptation.

35:54.244 --> 36:00.034
He was reaching for something
that was, uh... out of reach.

36:00.202 --> 36:02.659
That sounds familiar.

36:03.681 --> 36:07.132
Some might say
that's what makes a man great.

36:07.081 --> 36:10.449
If we all accepted
what was within our grasp.

36:10.719 --> 36:13.556
Sometimes what we have
is of more value.

36:13.518 --> 36:16.768
It takes a great man
to recognise that. I didn't.

36:18.836 --> 36:21.956
- I was a fool.
- Ernest, you've suffered enough.

36:22.596 --> 36:25.715
No sense wasting time in the past. Right?

36:32.393 --> 36:37.471
Ah! Yes. For the peak of the roof.
It will attract the lightning.

36:37.632 --> 36:39.708
You get Daniel.

36:43.190 --> 36:45.860
Take this to the roof.

36:49.869 --> 36:53.367
- You have to come. Now.
- Not yet. Get me when the gate's running.

36:53.306 --> 36:55.713
- There isn't time.
- I have to finish this.

36:55.706 --> 36:57.782
- It's not worth it!
- This is!

36:57.786 --> 36:58.983
Nothing is!

36:59.025 --> 37:02.228
Our history would be different
if everyone felt that way.

37:02.184 --> 37:07.427
No prize is worth attaining if you can
never share it. There would be no point.

37:07.304 --> 37:09.380
Believe me.

37:09.862 --> 37:11.938
I know.

37:39.934 --> 37:42.175
Let's go! Teal'c, start dialling in.

37:42.172 --> 37:46.253
We may only have seconds
once the gate is open.

37:46.572 --> 37:48.813
What you did was courageous.

37:48.811 --> 37:52.347
- What I did was stupid.
- Come on, boys. We gotta go. Now.

37:52.291 --> 37:54.697
- I'm staying.
- What?

37:55.289 --> 38:00.414
- Look, I will be fine down here.
- Daniel, we can come back.

38:00.288 --> 38:04.202
No. What if the castle crumbles
around the gate? This could all be lost.

38:04.126 --> 38:07.911
- If I stay, I could unbury it again.
- What if the gate falls into the ocean?

38:07.846 --> 38:10.847
- I am willing to take that risk.
- I'm not! Let's go.

38:10.804 --> 38:13.045
Jack!

38:14.485 --> 38:15.860
Please.

38:37.637 --> 38:39.594
Let's go.

38:43.594 --> 38:46.632
- It's a piece of cake.
- Not from what I remember.

38:46.596 --> 38:48.967
Come on.

38:48.954 --> 38:51.030
Go on.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.833
<i>Go!</i>

39:19.465 --> 39:23.628
<i>Wormhole is destabilising.
Still no travellers.</i>

39:23.543 --> 39:26.117
Come on, guys.

39:27.264 --> 39:29.340
<i>Stand by, people.</i>

39:43.257 --> 39:45.500
- Close one.
- You think?

39:45.498 --> 39:47.655
You don't know how close.

39:58.534 --> 40:00.692
<i>Chevron six encoded.</i>

40:08.490 --> 40:10.697
Chevron seven...

40:10.690 --> 40:12.898
will not engage.

40:16.688 --> 40:20.472
- I think it's safe to say the place is gone.
- You still have my book.

40:20.407 --> 40:24.737
Captain Carter's working on
a computer model right now.

40:25.246 --> 40:28.661
And here's the bright side - you're alive.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.126
Yes.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.833
Thanks to you.

40:32.844 --> 40:37.007
Look at it this way. If you ever run into
those aliens who made up the language,

40:36.923 --> 40:39.213
you can ask them what it means.

40:39.202 --> 40:41.360
You better let us know this time.

40:41.362 --> 40:43.936
I will. I promise.
