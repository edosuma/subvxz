WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.137
TANNER: Do you know
any of these people?

00:03.171 --> 00:06.474
No, which means that...
He could be one of them.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.143
DURAND: He's actually the one
who took the photograph.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.378
She said she knew him
through you.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.147
You should've just kept your
mouth shut about that girl.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.318
The last time we saw each other,

00:17.351 --> 00:20.121
I was accusing your son of
the worst possible crime.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.323
I'm not sure
what to think anymore.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.159
If he didn't kill Mia and
he dies because of this...

00:25.193 --> 00:27.628
All we can hope is that we get
a chance to make this right.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.630
Ochoa gets high,
goes to the street fair,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.365
which means that he could've
been at the street fair

00:31.399 --> 00:32.533
at the time that Mia was killed.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.601
SARA:
And there he is.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.604
*

00:50.351 --> 00:51.685
Hey, come on in.
ALEX: Hey.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.487
Why don't you answer your phone?
I've been...

00:53.521 --> 00:55.389
Do you remember that fund-raiser
that I hosted at AllSourcer

00:55.423 --> 00:57.225
when you were first
running for Congress?

00:57.258 --> 01:01.595
Do you still have a copy
of the guest list from that?

01:01.629 --> 01:04.565
Um, yeah-- I'm sure David could
find it. Why do you need it?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.700
Mia's travel pal,
the French guy, Olivier.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.702
He said that she met
her killer through me,

01:08.736 --> 01:11.305
somehow, so I'm making
a list of everyone

01:11.339 --> 01:13.241
that I might have
introduced her to.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.376
Okay, Jeffrey, that is
an impossible task.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.710
That list could be

01:16.744 --> 01:18.412
hundreds of people,
maybe thousands.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.348
What else am I supposed to do?

01:20.381 --> 01:23.184
I-I can't blame her death
on the sketchy people

01:23.217 --> 01:25.319
that she met volunteering
at a shelter anymore.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.321
Jeffrey, you can't
blame yourself, either.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.123
This is ridiculous.
Look what you're doing.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.458
Did you sleep?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.193
Is that a number two burrito?

01:32.226 --> 01:35.329
Yeah. I figured,
since I was coming by,

01:35.363 --> 01:36.597
I'd bring you
a little breakfast.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.200
I'm turning into a mother hen,
I swear to God.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.470
What are you doing here,
by the way?

01:42.503 --> 01:44.338
Well, the hearing for
Carlos's release is today,

01:44.372 --> 01:47.741
and I sort of developed
a bond with his mom, so...

01:47.775 --> 01:50.444
I wanted to see it
through to the end.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.313
Which means I'm going to need
every single thing you have

01:52.346 --> 01:53.681
on that alibi photo
for the trial.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.749
Everything, so I can get
caught up to speed and...

01:55.783 --> 01:57.485
Sure, no problem.
I'll text Mike

01:57.518 --> 01:59.587
and you can pick it up
downstairs.
Okay, great.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.490
But I'm gonna need that guest
list from the fund-raiser.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.757
You don't need it.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.426
Alex, I...

02:05.459 --> 02:07.295
You don't need
it, Jeffrey.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.397
Mia was not at the event,
remember?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.365
She was on a ski trip
in Colorado.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.670
Look, Jeffrey,
this is a victory.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.772
Getting Carlos out of prison,
it's a victory.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.509
We should be excited
and celebrate.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.511
Don't let your burrito
get cold.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.684
Really?
It's about time.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.686
So you know you promised me
a day off, right?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.388
Look, how long
have you known me, Tommy?

02:34.422 --> 02:35.789
You know you can't believe
everything I say.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.793
I was gonna get the car washed,
play a little hoop,

02:39.827 --> 02:42.663
and get caught up on some of the
games I recorded this weekend.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.666
Well, I'm sure the owner of
this house had some plans, too.

02:45.699 --> 02:46.734
Yeah, well...

02:46.767 --> 02:48.669
RUIZ:
Carl Bullock. Lived alone.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.604
Not real social.
The lady across the street

02:50.638 --> 02:52.540
saw his cat outside
this morning,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.675
went to tell him, saw the body
through the window.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.410
No forced entry,
no sign of a struggle.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.711
The casings are
all nine-mil.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.280
Any idea when it went down?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.614
Little after 11:00 last night.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.550
The neighbors across the street
heard the shots.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
They didn't call it in?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.486
They said they thought
somebody else would.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.258
Nothing like civic involvement.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.660
You got a stone-cold
whodunit on your hands,

03:12.693 --> 03:15.663
and a whole squad room full
of detectives to choose from.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.465
You had to ruin
my day off for this?

03:17.498 --> 03:19.433
I didn't call you
for what's on the floor.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.502
I called you for
what's in the basement.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.337
What's in...?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.741
*

03:56.704 --> 03:59.707
What the hell?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.743
Seems like you might want
to call Tanner, yeah?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.545
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

04:19.527 --> 04:20.494
Hey.

04:20.528 --> 04:21.895
Hey.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.366
TANNER:
Well, this is different.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.634
Guy was a bit of
a conspiracy nut, huh?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.268
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah, you can say that.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.644
These are Sophe cases.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.380
Guy was a Sophe user.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.715
Yeah. But you're missing the
biggest Sophe case of all.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.330
"Was Mia killed
to control Jeffrey Tanner?"

04:56.364 --> 04:58.632
SARA:
Carl Bullock

04:58.666 --> 05:00.401
was a Sophe user, all right.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.570
Yeah. We haven't instituted
a triple platinum level yet,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.605
but if we did,
Bullock would own it.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.374
Sophe was like crack
to this guy.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.875
He posted constantly.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.610
Some of it legit.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.645
He led the charge
to identify Jack Foley,

05:11.679 --> 05:13.481
and he helped pinpoint
which AllSourcer celebrities

05:13.514 --> 05:15.416
Lucas King would target.
That's great,

05:15.449 --> 05:17.651
but most of what's in here
is pretty out there.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.753
JOSH: Oh, no, there's plenty
of that here, too.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.589
Uh, most of his posts, actually.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.424
"Why isn't Sophe CrowdTec
looking

05:23.457 --> 05:25.693
into the CIA
detention center on Alcatraz?"

05:25.726 --> 05:26.960
"Sophe should investigate
the secret chemical fog

05:26.994 --> 05:28.962
used to control San Francisco."

05:28.996 --> 05:30.931
JOSH:
Looks like he was trying

05:30.964 --> 05:33.401
to spur interest,
maybe find support

05:33.434 --> 05:34.702
from other like-minded users.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.638
Anybody jump out as hostile?
Anyone I should look at?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.641
SARA:
No, most of the users seemed
to be pretty patient with him.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.543
Some even bought into
his theories.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.877
Hold up. He had fans?

05:43.911 --> 05:46.414
To some degree, yes.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.582
And what did he post
about Mia's case?

05:48.616 --> 05:50.784
Uh, nothing, actually.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.786
He's never contributed anything
to Mia's case.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.755
TANNER:
Well, doesn't that strike

05:54.788 --> 05:57.391
anybody as strange? I mean,
given his obvious interest.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.893
There's more than enough
strange here to go around.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.495
Do you think
he was murdered because of

06:01.529 --> 06:03.464
something he posted on Sophe?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.999
Or maybe something
he didn't post.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.437
All right, somebody breaks
in here, tosses the place.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.872
So whatever they're after
is worth killing for.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.875
The problem is
this guy must have been

06:14.908 --> 06:17.010
chasing at least
a hundred different theories.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.480
Yeah, so...

06:19.513 --> 06:22.516
all we have to do is figure out
which one got him killed.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.521
*

06:37.130 --> 06:40.634
Ms. Bullock, you and Carl were
separated for some time.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.636
About four years now.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.505
No divorce?

06:46.474 --> 06:50.177
I... I still loved him.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.846
I just, I couldn't
be with him anymore.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.649
I mean, you
saw that room.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.185
You have to know, though,
he wasn't always like that,

06:58.218 --> 07:00.020
like obsessed. He...

07:02.222 --> 07:05.526
He was a good husband and...

07:05.559 --> 07:08.095
he was a great father.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.531
We were happy.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.866
I'm sorry.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.935
Oh, that's all right.
You're fine.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.071
We had a son, Chris.
He was 17.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.873
He crashed one night
on the way home from work

07:19.907 --> 07:21.542
on his motorcycle.
It was a stupid accident.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.544
Just...

07:23.577 --> 07:26.547
He lost control,
went off the road.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.949
Carl could never
accept it.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.619
He started to believe
that the police lied

07:31.652 --> 07:33.921
on the accident report.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.156
He ran ads
looking for witnesses,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.892
parking for hours
by the accident site.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.629
When he was fired,
he decided that his boss

07:41.662 --> 07:43.964
was in on the conspiracy, too.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.067
I-I tried to pull
him back, but...

07:47.100 --> 07:50.103
there was nothing
that I could do.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.006
I...

07:53.040 --> 07:55.008
I lost him.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.977
I lost them both.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.950
Ms. Bullock...

08:02.983 --> 08:07.087
can you think of any reason
someone would want to harm Carl?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.689
I don't know.

08:08.722 --> 08:12.660
He... he was abrasive.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.728
A lot of people
didn't like that.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.630
Do you know
anything about

08:16.664 --> 08:18.198
Carl's more recent
investigations,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.033
like what he was working on?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.536
I'm sorry, Mr. Tanner.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.906
I... figured
that's why you were here.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.278
I-I'm sorry.
What do you mean?

08:31.311 --> 08:34.147
Well, your daughter's murder,
that was...

08:34.181 --> 08:37.150
Carl's latest obsession.

08:37.184 --> 08:42.022
Ever since you started Sophe,
that was pretty much his life.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.558
TANNER: Can you tell me anything
that-that he discovered,

08:44.592 --> 08:48.295
you know,
anything that he figured out?

08:48.328 --> 08:51.131
I hit a point a long time ago
where I couldn't listen anymore.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.734
We had a rule:
if Carl wanted to see me,

08:53.767 --> 08:56.303
we... no conspiracy talk.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.672
But you know that he was working
on my daughter's murder case?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.173
Only because he was

09:00.207 --> 09:02.309
obsessed with the reward money,
the $100 million.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.778
He was obsessed with
how he was gonna spend it.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.681
As if that would help
anything at all.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.284
Trust me, Mr. Tanner, I...

09:11.318 --> 09:13.553
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.295
Oh. Those are the ones
already scanned to Sophe.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.031
Those still need to go.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.633
Thanks for
pitching in, Megan.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.367
Sorry it's not more glamorous
than doing tech support

09:27.400 --> 09:29.069
back at The Hive.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.071
I don't know, it's
pretty interesting, actually.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.307
I mean, this guy was
insanely meticulous.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.109
Consider maybe
stopping at insane.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.778
No, seriously,
everything that he did,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.312
he footnoted to his journals.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.247
Everything on the walls,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.249
all the posts to Sophe,
it's all double-

09:42.282 --> 09:43.784
and triple-referenced.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.086
It's kind of brilliant,
actually.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.354
In a sad way.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.289
Yeah. Brilliant up
until he believes

09:49.322 --> 09:51.358
that Vladimir Putin
may have ordered Mia's murder.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.127
Or that the military
is releasing nerve agents

09:54.161 --> 09:57.030
into the fog to help control
the city's population.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.132
Actually, a Navy minesweeper
did release

09:59.166 --> 10:01.368
chemical bacteria
into the fog in the 1950s.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.703
TARIQ: Please don't tell me
you're buying into this stuff.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.739
I'm just saying, not all of it
can be summarily dismissed.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.240
Beg to differ.
Think it's pretty safe to say

10:07.274 --> 10:09.209
there's no such thing
as mind control.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.812
Or chemtrails.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.414
Or reptilian humanoids
living among us.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.050
Yeah, except you can't
actually say any of that.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.386
It's not an empirically sound
statement.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.855
So, do you believe
in these conspiracy theories?

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
No, I'm just saying, there's
no way to prove they're false

10:23.891 --> 10:25.292
in a purely scientific sense.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.860
Absence of evidence

10:26.894 --> 10:28.395
is not evidence of absence.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.732
Wow. Who thought, in a room
full of all this crazy stuff,

10:31.765 --> 10:34.167
the thing that'd
surprise me most is Josh?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.405
What's up?
The journals.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.408
Bullock had them all numbered
and cross-referenced.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.443
Yeah, meticulously. We know.
Right.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.246
But what I was gonna say is...
some of them are missing.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.384
Your Honor, as you heard
from the organizer of the event,

10:51.418 --> 10:53.186
this photo was taken
the night of the fair,

10:53.220 --> 10:54.755
and it clearly shows

10:54.788 --> 10:57.090
Carlos Ochoa in the crowd,
in a location other than

10:57.124 --> 10:59.292
Mia Tanner's apartment
at the time of her murder.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.295
Mr. Collier, do you agree?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.464
Your Honor, for the purposes
of this hearing,

11:04.497 --> 11:06.333
the People are willing
to stipulate

11:06.366 --> 11:08.301
to the authenticity
of the photograph.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.103
: This is good.
This is really good.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.205
The D.A.'s not
gonna fight it, okay?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.175
JUDGE: And if I grant
the defense's motion, and order

11:15.208 --> 11:17.377
a new trial for Mr. Ochoa?
Well, in the event

11:17.410 --> 11:19.212
of a new trial, the People,
of course, would reserve

11:19.246 --> 11:21.481
their right to do
further investigations, but...

11:21.514 --> 11:23.350
So the taxpayers would pay
for Mr. Ochoa's release,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.719
and the cost
of the new trial,

11:25.753 --> 11:28.856
all so that you can just
contest the evidence then?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.390
Your Honor,
the taxpayers are paying

11:30.423 --> 11:32.359
for Mr. Ochoa's
incarceration as it is.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.327
Yes, Ms. Quinn,
an incarceration he earned

11:34.361 --> 11:36.864
by virtue of being convicted
by a jury of his peers.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.899
The public has an interest
in the integrity

11:38.932 --> 11:42.135
of that verdict, and I am wary
of undermining that based on

11:42.169 --> 11:45.172
what amounts
to Internet vigilantism.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.307
Internet vigilantism?
The photo shows what it shows,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.376
regardless of whether
it was on the Internet or not.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.944
In fact, the photo
was publicly available

11:50.978 --> 11:53.213
at the time of
Mr. Ochoa's trial, was it not?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.248
Yes, Your Honor, but...

11:55.282 --> 11:56.283
This isn't evidence
that wasn't available

11:56.316 --> 11:58.185
to the defense previously.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.619
It's just evidence
that the defense failed to find.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.856
QUINN:
I didn't represent Mr. Ochoa at
his original trial, Your Honor.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.491
That's not the fault

12:04.524 --> 12:06.259
of the court, Ms. Quinn.
ALEX: Listen, Your Honor,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.828
the photo proves
that Carlos is innocent.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.329
It doesn't matter when

12:09.362 --> 12:11.398
we found it,
where we found it...

12:11.431 --> 12:14.835
Ms. Hale, I need you
to sit down and be quiet now.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.441
I will be taking this motion
under advisement.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.743
I will issue my decision
within 24 hours.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.347
I don't understand.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.249
Why isn't he
freeing Carlos?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.984
I don't know,
but don't worry.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.320
I promise,
this is gonna be okay.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.972
Well, I can see why
you're fascinated by it.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.207
Your picture's
right in the center.

12:58.578 --> 13:02.950
You don't really think Mia's
murder is about you, do you?

13:02.983 --> 13:06.386
I'm not sure what
to think anymore.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.488
Jeffrey, this man
was unhinged.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.423
Everything was a
conspiracy to him.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.560
Yeah, but we both know
that there's a conspiracy here.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.463
Someone arranged to take
Carlos Ochoa out in prison.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.431
Someone with means and power.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.567
Apparently,
someone I already know.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.602
Based on what?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.572
The word of some man Mia met
in a youth hostel somewhere?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.540
And, look, even
if it's true,

13:27.574 --> 13:30.610
even if Carl Bullock somehow
figured all of this out,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.346
why didn't he post
any of it on Sophe?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.949
We always intended
the $100 million reward

13:35.983 --> 13:37.450
be shared with everyone
who contributed

13:37.484 --> 13:38.919
to finding out
who killed Mia, right?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.921
Well, what if he wanted

13:40.954 --> 13:42.489
to keep all the money
for himself?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.357
All right, so it's just
simple game theory?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.293
Exactly. He didn't want
to share information

13:46.326 --> 13:48.428
'cause he didn't want
to share the prize.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.264
Yeah, he must have
found some bit of truth

13:51.298 --> 13:54.067
that got him killed.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.537
I just can't figure
out what it is.

13:57.570 --> 14:02.442
Gosh, if only we had a machine,
some sort of platform

14:02.475 --> 14:05.278
that could harness many minds
instead of one.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.615
Talk to me.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.050
Uh, all of Carl Bullock's

14:10.083 --> 14:12.352
theories and journals
have been posted.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.421
Well, the ones we have.
What do you mean,
the ones you have?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.588
TARIQ: Some of his
journals are missing.

14:15.622 --> 14:16.924
We don't know where they went.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.091
Well, the killer
probably took them

14:18.125 --> 14:19.626
'cause they contained clues

14:19.659 --> 14:20.961
about Mia's killer.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.629
We don't know that.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.365
Well, what else makes sense?
I mean, what about our posts?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.067
What have the responses been?
TARIQ: It's off the charts.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.368
Like, record levels.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.970
JOSH:
Yeah, we had to create

14:30.003 --> 14:31.604
a separate thread
just for all the tributes.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.540
SARA: Well, one of their
own has been killed.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.976
The users are coming together
en masse.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.310
Okay, well, that's beautiful,
but what about the case?

14:37.344 --> 14:38.411
The users are
working on it.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.712
They're trying
to connect the dots.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.415
But this guy's posts have been
intricately cross-referenced

14:42.449 --> 14:44.317
with his evidence logs,
journals.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.119
He has bibliographies
for his bibliographies.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.520
It's nuts.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.025
Tell me you got something.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.927
I checked out Bullock's
estranged wife.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.929
She had alibi for the murder.
What about ballistics,

14:55.963 --> 14:58.031
fingerprints?
I mean, what kind of stuff

14:58.065 --> 15:00.600
were you doing before
there was a Sophe? Come on.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.734
Slugs don't match anything
in the system.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.337
Neither do the prints.
He's way too smart for that.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.638
That's how he's been able
to stay under the radar

15:05.672 --> 15:07.540
for over a year.
Look, slow down, Tanner, okay?

15:07.574 --> 15:08.976
We don't know
if this has anything to do

15:09.009 --> 15:11.011
with Mia's death.
Bullock's ex said

15:11.044 --> 15:13.080
that Mia's case was the last
thing that he was working on.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.614
That she knew.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.349
She also said they didn't
talk about this work.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.585
Look, I know you're
mad, all right?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.353
I just don't want to see you
spin out over something

15:20.387 --> 15:21.021
that's probably just
a coincidence.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.123
A coincidence?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.594
I guess we'll see about that.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.063
JOSH:
The users are

15:30.097 --> 15:32.432
correlating Bullock's
journal entries to his posts.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.134
They've confirmed
which journals are missing.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.068
They're all connected to

15:36.003 --> 15:36.569
the same theory
Bullock was investigating.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.705
Not too late to change
your bet, Detective.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.407
Uh...

15:44.377 --> 15:46.713
TARIQ:
And the top vote-getter is...

15:46.746 --> 15:48.982
TANNER: "City Official
Part of a Reptilian

15:49.016 --> 15:50.650
Cabal."

15:53.453 --> 15:55.355
What the hell did you do?

16:01.428 --> 16:02.195
"City Official,
Reptilian Cabal"?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.131
What the hell does
that even mean?

16:05.132 --> 16:05.165
It's one of Bullock's
conspiracy theories.

16:05.932 --> 16:05.965
He believed that
a city supervisor,

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535
Kevin Simko, was a member of...

16:08.568 --> 16:10.337
Well, you get the rest.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.305
Just for the record, this
whole Lizard Man stuff--

16:12.339 --> 16:14.274
it's kind of
actually a thing.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.243
Four percent of Americans
believe that reptilian aliens

16:16.276 --> 16:18.011
are living among us,
masquerading as humans,

16:18.045 --> 16:19.312
and...
What was that thing, Josh?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.281
You said the absence of evidence
is the same as not evidence.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.083
Or wait.
How'd it go?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.086
Did-did you guys post everything
that Bullock had on Mia?

16:26.119 --> 16:27.787
Of course they did, Jeffrey.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.522
For once, Sophe
got it wrong,

16:29.556 --> 16:32.059
and I suspect it is
not the crowd's fault.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.127
Garbage in, garbage out.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.163
Run it again, and
do it right this time.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.405
SARA:
Excuse me, but I'm just

16:45.438 --> 16:48.475
trying to wrap my mind
around what I just witnessed.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.244
Sara, listen...
Did you just
disregard user results

16:51.278 --> 16:53.480
because they didn't match
your preconceptions?

16:53.513 --> 16:56.083
If properly harnessed,
the crowd is amazing,

16:56.116 --> 16:57.384
all right,
but it's not foolproof.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.187
If we put conspiracy theories
out there,

17:00.220 --> 17:02.389
it's going to produce
fringe results, all right?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.224
It's gonna create bias.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.826
Oh, wait, wait. Sorry.
This from a man who spent

17:06.859 --> 17:09.462
two hours today staring at this.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.565
Mia was real,
and her killer is real.

17:12.599 --> 17:17.137
Jeffrey, users didn't choose
the Lizard Man theory

17:17.170 --> 17:19.339
because they believe it.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.275
They chose it because that is
where the evidence led them.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.477
Yeah

17:24.511 --> 17:27.380
Because those are the
journals that are missing!

17:27.414 --> 17:31.184
And a user at City Hall said
he recently saw Bullock attend

17:31.218 --> 17:34.421
several supervisor meetings.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.623
Maybe there's something
in it, maybe there isn't.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.825
But the only way to know
is to follow it up.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.493
TANNER:
Where's Cavanaugh going?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.229
To talk to the
supervisor.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.231
Look, I know that
you wanted this to be

17:44.264 --> 17:47.100
about Mia-- we all did.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.836
But the only way we're
gonna solve her murder

17:49.869 --> 17:51.804
is through Sophe.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.211
Don't get stuck in a hall of
mirrors like Carl Bullock did.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.671
I'm sorry, Detective.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.140
If you want to maybe
schedule something.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.875
No, I'm good.
I'll-I'll wait.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.677
Joel, I need
the school board file.

18:30.710 --> 18:34.214
Supervisor Simko.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.315
Can I grab five minutes
of your time?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.284
Yeah.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.419
I want to ask you
about someone.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.158
It's Carl Bullock.
You know him?

18:45.192 --> 18:48.228
Yeah. Wish I didn't.
Guy's a colossal pain in my ass.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.362
I mean, he calls
here all the time

18:50.397 --> 18:51.264
leaving these bizarre
messages, he interrupts

18:52.399 --> 18:53.633
our board meetings making
all sorts of crazy claims.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.369
Like calling you
a Lizard Man maybe?

18:56.403 --> 18:59.306
Can you walk with me?

18:59.339 --> 19:00.440
Yeah.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.442
Yeah, apparently,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.178
I've got some some sort of
reptilian mind-control ability.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.613
I don't know. If only.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.648
It'd be funny, except,
these days, you never know

19:08.681 --> 19:10.483
if a guy like that's
gonna go off.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.285
In fact, I was thinking
about having my office

19:12.319 --> 19:13.586
look into
a restraining order.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.189
No need anymore.
Bullock's dead.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.258
Murdered in his home.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.427
Huh.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.395
Ah, sorry. Not gonna lose
any sleep over it.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.564
Can't imagine
the guy had much of a life.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.667
So, can you imagine a reason
why anyone would want him dead?

19:27.700 --> 19:30.303
Well, like I said,
the guy was a pain in the ass.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.272
You know, maybe he just

19:32.305 --> 19:34.574
pushed the wrong guy's
buttons, you know?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.343
Listen, Detective, I'm...

19:36.376 --> 19:38.278
I'm late for about
six different things right now.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.247
Of course. Thank
you for your time.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.651
I saw that Carl boarded
the number eight bus

19:44.684 --> 19:46.319
headed north on Samsome.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.555
I'm thinking he ended up
at Coit Tower.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.490
Why do you think that?
What

19:50.523 --> 19:53.560
NSA hyper-parabolic microphones.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.428
One of Bullock's theories was

19:55.462 --> 19:57.497
that the NSA has a listening
station on Telegraph Hill.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.499
Thank you, Ty.
Appreciate it.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.301
If you know anything else,
just get back to us.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.304
Actually, the O.S.S. did house
an observation station there

20:04.337 --> 20:05.605
during World War Two.
TANNER:
Josh stay with us, please.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.707
Come on, man.
I'm just saying,
a lot of these

20:07.740 --> 20:10.377
crazy-sounding ideas have
a basis in historical fact.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.645
What are we doing?
We're trying to coax
Josh back to reality.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.581
We're trying to piece together
Carl Bullock's movements

20:14.614 --> 20:17.016
over the last few days.
He didn't have a car,

20:17.049 --> 20:18.785
but Cavanaugh got us access
to his transit pass.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.587
Now, I've mapped
together all of

20:20.620 --> 20:24.391
Bullock's ride segments
over the last 72 hours.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.326
Um, yellow are bus rides,
blue is BART.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.527
Green: cable cars
and trolleys.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.462
And then what?
TANNER: And then we
contacted everyone

20:29.496 --> 20:30.797
who commented on
one of his posts.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.499
We got people
out in the field.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.033
We're basically
trying to match up

20:34.066 --> 20:35.768
his rides with any
of the theories.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.704
Lizard Man included?

20:37.737 --> 20:38.738
Lizard Man,
Lizard Woman, Lizard Baby.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.042
TARIQ: It's a user from the
Powell Street BART station.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.712
Carl was there twice
yesterday afternoon.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.450
I'm sorry, I have to
handle this. Excuse me.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.488
Judge Bauman used to be known
as "Bleeding-Heart Bauman."

20:55.522 --> 20:57.657
Three years ago,
he granted a motion

20:57.690 --> 21:00.026
to release an inmate
named Willis Lee.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.794
Two months later,
Willis Lee raped and killed

21:01.828 --> 21:04.431
a high school student
in San Pablo.
TANNER: Let me guess.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.699
Bauman's heart's starting
to bleed a whole lot less now.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.435
ALEX:
What's the old saying?

21:08.468 --> 21:11.471
A conservative is just
a liberal who got mugged?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.606
I should have
seen this coming. I'm sorry.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.575
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do

21:15.608 --> 21:17.810
if Bauman rules against us.
Then what?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.612
QUINN: Well, the next step
would be to file a petition

21:19.646 --> 21:21.581
with the state court of appeals.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.584
Eventually that might get
to the California Supreme Court.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.620
That could take months or years.
I mean, that's so long.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.356
I'm just explaining
the options.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.358
It's just frustrating
because Bauman knows

21:31.391 --> 21:33.493
that Carlos is innocent,
and yet he won't release him.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.861
He just doesn't want it

21:34.894 --> 21:37.730
to blow up in his face
if he lets him out.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.734
We have to make sure it blows up
in his face if he doesn't.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.503
What are you doing?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.104
I got a few hundred thousand
friends that might be able

21:45.137 --> 21:46.072
to help us out on this.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.443
Hey, we're getting
reports from users

21:50.477 --> 21:51.744
about Carl Bullock's
whereabouts.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.882
Whoa, check out the
blast from the past.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.750
It's ForceofWill.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.619
Hey, what's up, Team Sophe?

21:59.652 --> 22:00.753
SARA:
Oh, Will.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.555
It's good to see you again.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.091
I didn't take you
for the conspiracy type.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.626
Yeah, it's more of a hobby.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.828
But, you know,
Bullock was, uh, good people.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.497
What have you got for us?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.699
Bullock took a bus
to Van Ness and Eddy

22:12.732 --> 22:14.667
the past three nights.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.104
I was driving around the area,
and, uh, I just got lucky.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.540
Lucky how?

22:20.573 --> 22:23.576
Oh, there are a couple, uh,
no-tell motels in the area.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.646
You'll never believe
who I just saw go into one.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.117
The lizard man himself.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.386
Kevin Simko.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.395
WILL: Great donut place
just around the corner. I mean,

22:42.429 --> 22:45.131
if I'd have known you guys
were coming, I'd save you some.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.500
Well, we're fine.
Thank you, though.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.668
You know, we got
this covered.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.870
Might be better if
you head on home.
You kidding me?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.905
I've been a Sophe user
from day one. I'm staying.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.877
Tell me something, Will.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.180
I'm always on the other side.
What made you start using Sophe?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.649
Was it the reward money?

23:02.682 --> 23:04.884
No.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.186
No, I never even
think about that.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.755
Honestly, my whole life,

23:08.788 --> 23:11.691
I've sort of had to depend
on other people.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.961
Sophe gives me a chance
to give back a little, you know?

23:14.994 --> 23:17.697
To-to help someone else out.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.633
Plus, when I was a kid, I really
loved T.J. Hooker, so...

23:21.768 --> 23:24.136
Of course.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.642
That's Simko there.

23:29.676 --> 23:30.743
I-I told you.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.420
Is that Mrs. Bullock?

23:48.227 --> 23:49.996
Bullock had it wrong.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.699
Supervisor's not a lizard.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.534
He's a snake.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.075
Mrs. Bullock.
Anything you want to tell me

24:03.109 --> 24:05.545
before I talk to your boyfriend?

24:05.578 --> 24:08.080
Look, I know you
have an alibi.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.982
But if you know anything
about your husband's murder

24:10.016 --> 24:11.684
and keep silent...
I've told you

24:11.718 --> 24:12.919
everything I know, Detective.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.522
I was sleeping with a married
man-- I'm not proud of that--

24:16.556 --> 24:17.690
but I don't know
anything about Carl's death.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.892
I don't know what else to say.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.694
All right.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.035
Here.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.575
I know how this looks.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.809
I'm not judging.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.516
The truth is I would have
filed for divorce,

24:43.550 --> 24:45.852
but it would have sent Carl
deeper into a spiral.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.855
Once you lose a child,

24:48.888 --> 24:51.991
it's tough for any marriage
to survive that.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.027
Ours didn't even last that long.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.030
Sorry.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.805
It's funny how much
you can still care about someone

25:05.838 --> 25:07.707
even after
you've been pushed apart.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.745
I wasn't expecting that.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.985
If you, uh,
if you don't mind me asking...

25:19.018 --> 25:21.153
I mean, how long...

25:21.187 --> 25:24.023
you know, I mean,
since... your son...?

25:24.056 --> 25:26.626
Five years.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.632
Does it get easier?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.670
I don't think so.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.709
I just think...

25:42.742 --> 25:46.679
maybe some people are better
at dealing with it than others.

25:50.817 --> 25:54.887
I want it noted that my client
is here voluntarily,

25:54.921 --> 25:57.824
out of respect
for the San Francisco police.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.660
Oh, yeah, I
feel the love.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.928
Why didn't you tell me about
your affair with Emma Bullock?

26:01.961 --> 26:04.063
Didn't think my personal life
was relevant.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.832
I tell you Carl Bullock

26:05.865 --> 26:07.734
was murdered, you're sleeping
with the guy's wife,

26:07.767 --> 26:08.835
you didn't think
it was relevant?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.107
Okay.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.110
You said Bullock was
a pain in the ass.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.212
He ever threaten to
reveal your affair?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.815
Maybe over the mic
at a supervisor's meeting?

26:22.849 --> 26:24.216
This is ridiculous, all right?
I didn't kill him.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.818
You certainly
had motive.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.820
A wife, kids.
A political career.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.122
I think my client
already made it clear

26:30.156 --> 26:31.924
he had nothing to do
with Mr. Bullock's death.

26:31.958 --> 26:35.728
It's just better to
get it all out here,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.096
between us,

26:37.129 --> 26:39.098
in this room.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.833
Is that some kind
of a threat, Detective?

26:40.867 --> 26:42.234
I'm just trying to
clear things up.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.903
You've already
lied to me once.

26:43.936 --> 26:44.971
I want to know
if there's anything else

26:45.004 --> 26:46.005
you're lying about.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.039
Okay, I think
we're done here.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.748
Hey. Mr. Simko.

26:55.782 --> 26:59.118
Where were you the night
Carl Bullock was killed?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.820
I was in my office,
working late.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.122
Dedicated public
servant, huh?

27:03.155 --> 27:04.957
Anyone corroborate that?

27:04.991 --> 27:06.759
Joel.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.130
Tell him. You were
there, you saw me.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.700
Uh...

27:13.733 --> 27:16.135
Yeah, we were both
working late.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.004
I remember.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.039
DRUMMOND: That clear
things up enough for you,

27:20.072 --> 27:21.040
Detective?

27:25.912 --> 27:28.114
Let's just be clear
about something else.

27:28.147 --> 27:32.051
If any part of our conversation
gets out of this office,

27:32.084 --> 27:34.821
your career's a lot closer
to being ruined than mine.

27:41.127 --> 27:44.897
I'm not a detective, Detective,
but that alibi...

27:44.931 --> 27:46.699
seems a little shady to me.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.242
Mr. Tanner, how do you think...

27:56.275 --> 27:59.245
No comment. Thank you.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.151
TANNER:
Nice audience.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.919
You like that?
Yeah.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.320
Well, I do have a
full-time press secretary,

28:08.354 --> 28:11.023
so I need to get my money's
worth once in a while.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.059
BAILIFF:
Stay seated.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.260
Come to order.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.698
Good morning, everyone.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.938
It appears we have
a bit more interest

28:25.972 --> 28:27.907
in today's proceedings
than usual.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.942
In that case,
I'll get right to my decision.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.944
I am...
Your Honor.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.946
Before you make
your ruling,

28:33.980 --> 28:36.148
defense moves that you
recuse yourself from this case.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.851
On what grounds?

28:38.885 --> 28:40.953
Conflict of interest,
Your Honor.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.021
Conflict of...

28:42.054 --> 28:44.857
Have you lost your
mind, Ms. Quinn?

28:44.891 --> 28:46.759
There's absolutely
no basis for that here.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.294
Actually, Your Honor,
there is.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.929
Clearly, you have

28:49.962 --> 28:51.230
a personal vendetta against me.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.302
All of you,

28:56.335 --> 28:58.337
in my chambers now.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.375
What possible grudge

29:03.409 --> 29:06.145
could I have against
you, Mr. Tanner?

29:06.178 --> 29:09.381
One based on the fact that I
cost you a great deal of money.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.117
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

29:11.150 --> 29:13.385
and I'm not sure
you do, either.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.254
Your investment portfolio.

29:15.287 --> 29:19.158
Until recently,
it contained a sizable stake

29:19.191 --> 29:20.893
in my old company, AllSourcer,
which unfortunately

29:20.927 --> 29:22.895
took a great tumble
when I left.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.864
I guess there's
just no substitute

29:24.897 --> 29:26.132
for great management.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.034
BAUMAN:
This is outrageous.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.335
I have a financial advisor
who handles this.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.870
I have nothing to do with it.

29:30.903 --> 29:33.039
And my decision
in this case has

29:33.072 --> 29:35.074
absolutely nothing
to do with you.
And I don't doubt that

29:35.107 --> 29:36.408
for a minute, but you
have to understand,

29:36.442 --> 29:38.177
there's a lot
of press out there.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.279
Which story do you think
they're gonna want to run with?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.982
Mr. Tanner, I'm warning you.
"Rich judge keeps
disadvantaged kid

29:43.015 --> 29:46.152
in prison because he's angry
about his stock portfolio."

29:46.185 --> 29:49.188
See, I think that that
story will have legs.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.422
I will find you in contempt,

29:50.456 --> 29:52.191
and I will have you charged
with extortion.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.894
Okay, listen to me,
both of you, please.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.896
Your Honor, if I may.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.330
When Carlos was on trial

29:58.364 --> 30:01.233
for what we thought he did
to our daughter,

30:01.267 --> 30:04.203
we both wanted him behind bars
for the rest of his life,

30:04.236 --> 30:06.205
but we were so wrong to do that.

30:06.238 --> 30:09.041
Because he didn't do it.
We know that now.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.878
The picture proves it.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.913
And knowing that an innocent man

30:13.946 --> 30:17.083
has suffered
the way that he has...

30:17.116 --> 30:20.920
knowing that another mother
may lose her child...

30:20.953 --> 30:23.222
you have the chance to be
on the right side of this.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.225
So we are asking you...

30:26.258 --> 30:28.360
to please let him go.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.401
Hey. You having
any luck?

30:35.434 --> 30:37.069
You realize that's
an insult, right?

30:37.103 --> 30:39.972
Implying what we do is
at all related to luck.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.974
I do now. I asked if
they could find out

30:42.008 --> 30:43.976
where Simko was
on Tuesday night.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.945
The night of
Bullock's murder?

30:45.978 --> 30:47.346
I thought he had an alibi.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.015
Not one I'm buying.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.950
What do you got?
As you can probably guess,

30:50.983 --> 30:53.119
Simko is not a big
public transit guy.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.487
But what perk do
upper

30:55.521 --> 30:58.490
A city-issued toll pass.
Ruiz got one for her promotion.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.926
Jealous much?

30:59.959 --> 31:01.060
JOSH:
Simko may have told you

31:01.093 --> 31:02.228
he was working
in his office,

31:02.261 --> 31:04.063
but according
to his billing records,

31:04.096 --> 31:06.132
his toll pass went for a drive.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.499
9:38 p.m.,
he crossed

31:07.533 --> 31:10.202
the Bay Bridge, eastbound;
10:17, he's back

31:10.236 --> 31:11.337
on the Bay Bridge,
this time city-bound.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.072
SARA: So, he was in
the East Bay area

31:13.105 --> 31:14.273
for 40 minutes.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.175
What was he doing?

31:16.208 --> 31:19.478
Let me limit Bullock's data
to that same time frame.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.180
Bullock went
to San Leandro?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.949
They were both
in the East Bay

31:22.982 --> 31:25.217
at the same time.
Why

31:25.251 --> 31:27.353
Yesterday, when we were
tracking Bullock's movements,

31:27.386 --> 31:30.156
users had a couple theories
on why he might have gone there.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.958
Capital Northern,

31:31.991 --> 31:34.393
FMT...

31:34.426 --> 31:35.894
Walland Construction.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.931
There were plans and models

31:38.965 --> 31:40.532
in Simko's office
for the renovation of Muni Hall.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.468
Walland is the contractor.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.436
Josh, can you put that
out to our users?
Yeah.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.075
I heard the good news.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.010
Took a little
persuading, but, uh,

31:51.043 --> 31:53.045
ultimately the judge
ruled in our favor.

31:53.079 --> 31:56.148
So when is Carlos is free?
Very soon.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.316
That's not good news,
that's great news.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.417
That it is.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.056
It's a user named
Matt_Builder67.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.191
He-he thinks
there's something shady

32:05.224 --> 32:06.425
about the Muni Hall deal.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.160
Hi, Matt, it's Sara.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.396
You've got info
on the Muni Hall renovation?

32:10.429 --> 32:13.432
Yeah, my company
put in a bid for that job.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.168
And I know for a fact that we
were a cheaper, better package.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.469
But the contract
didn't go to you.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.471
We had it in the bag.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.540
Then, out of nowhere,
it was awarded to Walland.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.209
I don't mean to offend you,
sir, but it sounds

32:23.242 --> 32:25.044
a little like sour grapes.
Hey, look, I get paid

32:25.077 --> 32:27.179
by the hour--
doesn't matter to me.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.048
But I know that
Walland's been involved

32:29.081 --> 32:30.549
in dozens
of sketchy deals, and...

32:30.582 --> 32:33.319
wouldn't surprise me
if this one stunk, too.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.354
That's just my two cents.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.455
All right, thank you, Matt.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.490
So, what if someone bribed Simko

32:38.524 --> 32:41.060
to award the contract
to Walland?

32:41.093 --> 32:42.228
Well, if he's out there
at their offices

32:43.329 --> 32:44.096
at 10:00 at night,
he's not looking at blueprints.

32:44.997 --> 32:45.564
Yeah, maybe he was
getting his payoff,

32:46.498 --> 32:47.366
and Bullock witnessed it.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.634
Bullock's riding
public transportation.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.536
It's gonna take him a while
to get home from the East Bay.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.171
Gives Simko plenty of time

32:52.204 --> 32:53.505
to drive there
and be waiting on him.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.577
Hey.
Hey.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.112
Thanks for coming
right over.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.081
Yeah.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.383
Simko didn't show up
at City Hall today.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.618
Well, if he's following Sophe,
he may already be in the wind.

33:06.652 --> 33:07.619
You think?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.621
Hey. Do you hear that?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.328
Car engine.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.592
This is Lieutenant Ruiz.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.295
I need emergency medical
response at my location.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.629
It's too late.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.774
Hey, Tommy.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.311
So, it turns out
our vic left a suicide note

34:05.344 --> 34:06.445
on his AllSourcer page.

34:06.478 --> 34:07.613
We sure it was him?

34:07.646 --> 34:09.281
The wife seems
to think so.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.350
It was an apology,
and some details

34:11.383 --> 34:13.385
about their anniversary trip--
stuff only he would know.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.620
He give a reason?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.388
Well, news about
the construction bribe

34:16.422 --> 34:18.424
was about to break,
and on top of that,

34:18.457 --> 34:19.725
the wife found out
about the affair.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.793
So, kind of
a perfect storm, you know?

34:21.827 --> 34:22.761
Thanks, Clay.
Here you go.

34:22.794 --> 34:24.263
Autopsy report?

34:24.296 --> 34:25.364
Yeah.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.333
Cause of death:

34:27.366 --> 34:29.235
carbon monoxide poisoning.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.502
Well, there's no surprise there.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.271
This is weird, though.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.605
Tox screen shows enough sedative

34:33.639 --> 34:35.374
in Simko's blood
to knock out a horse.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.675
Well, we've seen
that before.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.544
Someone's afraid
to go through with it,

34:38.577 --> 34:41.647
so they take alcohol and pills
to make it easier.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.383
Yeah, but there's no trace
of pills in his stomach.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.518
According to the doc,
that means he was alive

34:46.552 --> 34:48.787
at least 90 minutes
after taking the pills.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.722
And he would never survive that
long with the engine running.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.393
All right, let's run this.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.828
So, all right, a guy
gets in his car,

34:56.862 --> 34:58.564
takes a handful
of pills.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.532
He would have to start
the engine quickly, right?

35:00.566 --> 35:02.301
Before he passed out.
But if that's the case,

35:02.334 --> 35:04.770
then he would be dead
before the pills are digested.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.572
The time line
doesn't make sense.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.740
There's only one way it works.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.243
If Simko was already unconscious
for at least an hour...

35:13.312 --> 35:15.247
...then someone else
started the car.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.597
CAVANAUGH:
There.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.300
What's missing?

35:35.667 --> 35:39.271
Zoom in, right corner
of the windshield.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.541
Those Velcro strips.
Toll pass is missing.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.676
It wasn't in his
car or his wife's.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.478
SARA: But if Simko didn't have
his pass, then someone else

35:46.512 --> 35:49.381
drove to San Leandro
the night of the murder.

35:49.415 --> 35:52.284
Do you still have access
to his toll pass data?

35:52.318 --> 35:54.320
Unless the user pulled it.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.555
Uh, here. I've still got
last month's billing cycle.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.790
Simko's pass made
almost daily trips

35:58.824 --> 36:00.692
across the Golden Gate Bridge.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.361
Inbound in the morning,
out in the evening.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.396
Like traveling into the city
from Marin.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.864
That mean anything
to you?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.799
Simko's assistant, Joel--
he lives in Kentfield.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.368
And he probably
knows enough

36:09.401 --> 36:11.403
about Simko
to fake a suicide note.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.549
How long have you lived
up in Marin County, Joel?

36:26.318 --> 36:29.488
Uh, for a year or so.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.656
The commute must suck.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.658
:
I'm guessing.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.295
Helps, though, if you have
your boss's toll pass, right?

36:38.797 --> 36:41.467
That's what we found
in your car.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.502
Guess you had it
for a while now.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.904
Is that
what this is about?

36:45.937 --> 36:47.939
That I have
Kevin's pass?

36:47.973 --> 36:50.409
He let me use it--
it... it was his idea,

36:50.442 --> 36:52.411
just to save me the
tolls every day.

36:52.444 --> 36:55.447
So he was just
being nice to you.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.419
And this is how you repay him.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.689
I don't know
what you mean.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.691
You handled
the incoming bids

37:05.724 --> 37:08.694
to the Muni Hall project
for your boss, didn't you?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.696
Not really. I just passed
all that along to Kevin.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.564
Joel...

37:12.598 --> 37:14.700
we talked to the foreman
at Walland Construction.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.835
He came clean,

37:16.868 --> 37:19.671
admitting to paying you
50 grand

37:19.705 --> 37:21.940
to fix the bids.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.976
And we tossed
your apartment, too.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.446
Found Carl Bullock's
missing journals

37:27.479 --> 37:29.715
in a Dumpster
in the back of your building.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.484
I-I...

37:32.518 --> 37:34.486
Maybe I should have a lawyer.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.555
You can have all
the lawyers you want.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.490
We have everything
we need on you.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.729
Carl Bullock saw you,
didn't he?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.764
Getting the payoff?

37:45.797 --> 37:47.866
Is that why you killed him?

37:47.899 --> 37:51.737
What the hell
was he even doing there?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.739
The guy was insane.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.707
Chasing after lizard men?

37:55.741 --> 37:57.809
You went into his house,

37:57.843 --> 37:59.878
and you shot him.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.686
What about
your boss, Joel?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.655
What about Kevin?

38:13.659 --> 38:16.662
He figured it out.

38:16.695 --> 38:17.929
About the bids.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.432
So...

38:20.466 --> 38:22.534
I had no choice.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.441
You're... you're gonna tell
them that I cooperated, right?

38:29.475 --> 38:31.710
That they should
go easy on me?

38:31.743 --> 38:34.480
All this destruction
for 50 grand?

38:34.513 --> 38:36.448
Not a chance in hell.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.692
Hey.
Hey.

38:46.725 --> 38:47.793
Nice work.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.998
What's this?

38:53.031 --> 38:54.666
I got your car washed.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.768
And I can also tell
you all the scores

38:56.802 --> 38:58.437
from last weekend's
games, so, you know,

38:59.671 --> 39:00.506
you don't have to waste
time watching them.

39:01.272 --> 39:02.641
Hey, don't you dare.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.710
It would be nice
to get a day off.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.512
Yeah, that would be
nice, wouldn't it?

39:06.545 --> 39:08.013
But that's not gonna happen.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.498
Aw.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.044
We're never
gonna have that.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.580
The happy ending.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.650
Jeffrey...

39:44.683 --> 39:45.784
You go.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.588
I'll be there in a sec.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.507
*

40:17.816 --> 40:19.017
ALEX:
So excited.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.852
Hi, honey. How are you?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.654
*

40:35.166 --> 40:37.703
*

41:03.995 --> 41:06.197
Are you going to let me in?

41:06.231 --> 41:08.066
Well, uh... I'm just...

41:08.099 --> 41:10.802
I'm in a zone right now,
and I-I just don't want

41:10.836 --> 41:12.971
to lose it.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.708
What did I warn you about,

41:16.742 --> 41:18.710
spinning into a hole
by yourself?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.812
I know, I know, I just,
I'm so close, though.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.681
Well, that's great.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.083
But don't push us out.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.819
Let all of us help you.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.021
"All of us"?

41:36.862 --> 41:38.830
Tanner,

41:38.864 --> 41:40.966
we're all trying to
find Mia's killer.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.834
That's why we're here.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.603
Yeah. Let's get it right
this time.

41:46.672 --> 41:47.973
That's what
Sophe's all about.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.108
Well, that's why
you built it, isn't it?

41:50.141 --> 41:51.977
ALEX: So let us
help you, dum-dum.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.012
Please.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.982
And let them
bloody help you, too.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.250
JOSH: I've got
a photo of the board

41:59.284 --> 42:00.819
ready to post.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.895
Thank you.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.697
Let's get to work.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.000
