I got something for you.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.518
Here,
it's a Saint Christopher.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.721
Don't get too verklempt.
It's a loaner.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.857
I give it to people
who are going through a time.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.792
It's got good history.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.694
All right.

12:16.036 --> 12:20.205
TV PRESENTER: <i> It's not just</i>
<i> looking like a victory</i>
<i> for Richard M. Nixon,</i>

12:20.207 --> 12:22.907
<i> but an almost unprecedented</i>
<i> landslide victory,</i>

12:22.909 --> 12:27.445
<i> as the final electoral</i>
<i> college votes are tallied.</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:30.882
Everybody is happy.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.650
<i> And Nixon has selected</i>
<i> Maryland's governor,</i>
<i> Spiro Agnew,</i>

12:32.652 --> 12:35.320
<i> as his running mate</i>
<i> for the office</i>
<i> of vice president.</i>

12:35.322 --> 12:38.323
You don't seem happy,
Detective.

12:38.892 --> 12:43.228
It's okay. I know
you wanted to fix this,

12:43.897 --> 12:46.765
but some things
can't be fixed.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.303
Do you want me
to say something?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.205
To who?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.174
Your mother.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.977
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

13:08.655 --> 13:10.121
Thank you, Maria.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.489
SAM: Grace.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.492
I don't think I need
to say it, do I?

13:14.494 --> 13:19.731
Well, Maria let me in.
I'll leave as soon
as you listen.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.599
Tonight. It has to be tonight.

13:21.601 --> 13:25.870
I waited for tonight
because I knew
tonight was important.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.373
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.943
I found her, Grace.
Three months ago, I found her.

13:31.945 --> 13:36.114
And I've visited
every other week since.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.283
My daughter.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.718
You visited my daughter.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.086
Have you?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.755
Ever?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.324
I hope, Grace,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.359
I really hope that
now the election is over

13:48.361 --> 13:49.527
that you'll let her
out of there.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.463
Don't you tell me
what I can and can't do
with my own child.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.532
You asked me to find her
last year, remember?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.569
You came to me
and you asked me to
help bring your baby back.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.505
What you brought back
isn't my girl.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.808
All she did,
all she ever does,
is embarrass me.

14:03.810 --> 14:07.478
-Just let her go
and live her life.
-And what about my life?

14:07.480 --> 14:11.249
I helped win this election
as much as Ken or my father.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.383
Me. And I'm gonna
help win more.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.320
And you would rather
do that than be a mom,
than help your...

14:15.322 --> 14:16.387
I helped.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.790
(SCOFFS) I loved.

14:18.792 --> 14:24.429
I bandaged, kissed, drove,
nursed, worried myself sick.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.566
Stayed with a man
I barely know. For what?
To see her in jail,

14:28.568 --> 14:34.372
where she tells me
I put her there 'cause
I'm such a loveless bitch.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.609
I think that's what
being a parent is, Grace.

14:37.611 --> 14:41.613
You love them and eat
a lifetime of pain in return.

14:41.615 --> 14:42.614
Tell me how to be a parent.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.750
You raised a traitor
and put his mother
in the ground.

14:45.752 --> 14:50.255
-Grace, do not...
-Touch me, and I'll kill you.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.525
No, you'd have
the help do it.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.195
Right on cue.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.566
-Grace...
-He was not invited.

15:02.736 --> 15:07.105
Detective, we have
eight Secret Service agents
on the premises.

15:07.107 --> 15:11.042
Whatever the plan is here,
amend it, now.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.746
I always wondered
what kept you two together.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.382
Never thought it'd be Dick.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.725
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:34.734 --> 15:36.534
Excuse me.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.604
-I'm looking for
Detective Shafe.
-You are?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.072
His wife.

15:42.108 --> 15:42.907
Uh...

15:42.909 --> 15:46.077
Sergeant, is my husband here,
yes or no?

15:47.213 --> 15:51.516
Apologies for...
Not exactly sure what.

15:51.518 --> 15:55.119
-When will he be back?
-It's hard to say.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.888
Thank you.

15:56.890 --> 16:01.025
What's the problem, Lindenoff?
I got a run in my hose
or something?

16:02.829 --> 16:03.261
Where is he?

16:03.263 --> 16:06.898
You told Sarge
this was a police matter.
I happen to be a policeman.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.399
Maybe I can help you.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.471
KRISTIN:
<i> It's about Bunchy Carter.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:17.642
<i> He was arrested for</i>
<i> assaulting a police officer...</i>

16:19.946 --> 16:21.746
Which doesn't sound like
Bunchy at all.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.983
Sounds exactly
like Bunchy, actually.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.365
It's smaller
than the other day.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.767
Guess I'm doing okay.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.702
How do you feel?

16:45.105 --> 16:47.872
Good. Yeah, I feel good.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.507
Thank you.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.043
When do you switch me
to methadone?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.679
I already did. Two weeks ago.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.483
Wow. You're a sly one.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.918
Can I be straight
with you, Jim?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.021
Yeah, if I can be
straight with you.

17:03.023 --> 17:07.158
I know your name's not Jim,
and I know you're
not Sam's snitch.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.926
I'm pretty sure you're a cop.

17:08.928 --> 17:12.030
-Is that what you were
gonna tell me?
-Pretty much.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.967
-And what were you
gonna tell me?
-I'm an addict.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.269
Oh.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.404
-You still...
-No.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.540
See, the thing is,
after the first time
I kicked it,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.076
I started saying
I was an addict.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.444
Second time, same thing.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.647
By the fifth time I kicked,
well, I just figured,

17:29.649 --> 17:33.618
you know, maybe
this isn't something
you ever leave behind.

17:33.853 --> 17:37.722
So you're saying you're
just gonna get me clean
and I'm just gonna relapse?

17:37.724 --> 17:42.593
I'm saying you're gonna
get clean, and, yeah,
I think you're gonna relapse.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.695
Not because
you're weak or bad,

17:44.697 --> 17:47.799
but because relapse happens
more often than not.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.635
And I'm saying this to you
because if I'm right,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.771
I don't want you
to lie or hide,
and don't kill yourself.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.909
-I'm not gonna kill myself.
-You don't know
what you're gonna.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.410
Neither do I.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.480
Just promise me
you'll come back here
and get clean

18:02.482 --> 18:05.116
as many times as you need to.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.985
Thank you.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.654
SAM: You punch a cop?

18:09.656 --> 18:12.657
-I did.
-Do I know my man?

18:12.659 --> 18:15.893
-And your reason
was righteous?
-Fully and inarguably.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.397
More magnificent than Carnac.
So, details.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.033
Without warrant
or provocation,

18:22.035 --> 18:25.503
half a dozen uniformed
officers and three detectives
from your vice squad

18:25.505 --> 18:26.137
from your Vice Squad

18:26.139 --> 18:30.007
disarmed, searched,
and assaulted
my security personnel.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.409
When I objected, verbally,

18:31.411 --> 18:34.278
they assaulted me
and began a search
of our headquarters.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.014
When you want to
hear an actual
police report, Sam...

18:37.016 --> 18:38.216
Brez, I will swing by.

18:38.218 --> 18:42.920
In the meantime,
you maybe want to
ice that eye a little bit.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.526
All right, what'd they say
they were looking for?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.660
Narcotics.

18:49.662 --> 18:54.732
"One, no Black Panther
party member shall have
narcotics in his possession.

18:54.734 --> 18:59.036
"Two, if a Panther member
should have narcotics
in his possession,

18:59.038 --> 19:00.438
"he will be expelled."

19:00.440 --> 19:02.507
Rules one and two
of the party, right?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.074
Close enough.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.143
And yet that's
what the policemen found.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.244
Because they brought them.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.514
And you're 100% sure that
100% of your foot soldiers

19:09.516 --> 19:11.349
and their women and their kids
are 100% clean?

19:11.351 --> 19:16.420
Just as sure as you are that
100% of your fellow officers
never plant evidence.

19:16.422 --> 19:20.024
All right, well,
now you're just trying
to hurt my feelings.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.093
What'd they say they found?

19:22.095 --> 19:22.393
LSD.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.297
Now, by this point,
they'd already begun to draw
weapons and lay hands on us.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.498
At which point, you...

19:27.500 --> 19:28.065
Defended myself.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.667
By throwing the first punch.
Don't lie, now.

19:29.669 --> 19:35.339
He threw the first punch.
But the man hits like
he plants evidence.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.507
No technique.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.910
I dropped him in one pop.

19:39.012 --> 19:39.410
And?

19:39.412 --> 19:43.915
Retaliation from his brothers
after they hooked me up.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.817
I don't know, Bunchy.

19:47.253 --> 19:50.855
If they convict you of this,
it's 13 years.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.392
I mean, it was
a hell of a right cross,
but was it worth it?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.693
The evidence was planted.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.796
-So you say.
-And which you can prove.

19:58.798 --> 20:03.067
We got history, Hodiak.
I'm calling it in.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.969
You want riots?

20:04.971 --> 20:07.505
Just leave me right here.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.143
CHARMAIN:
<i> So, if he admits he hit a cop,</i>
<i> then what can you do?</i>

20:12.145 --> 20:15.446
Believe him, which I do,
mainly because it's LSD,

20:15.448 --> 20:18.683
which is kind of a groovy,
way-out, touch-the-stars,

20:18.685 --> 20:21.953
"What's your
white suburban pain?" drug,
you know?

20:21.955 --> 20:25.856
These guys,
they're into loading magazines
and storming the barricades.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.558
-Just isn't them.
-So you want me to...

20:27.560 --> 20:29.594
Yeah, well, this feels
too sophisticated for Vice.

20:29.596 --> 20:34.065
It bears the sticky
fingerprints and bumbling
competence of the Red Squad.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.767
Yeah, I kind of thought
that was the direction
you were headed.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.605
So just do a little fishing,
see if you hear anything?

20:40.607 --> 20:41.839
Sure.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.307
Thank you.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.479
Babe, how's that supposed
to come up in conversation?

20:48.481 --> 20:50.481
I tell the guys
you're my wife, Kristin.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.584
Not "my Negro wife,"
not "my old black
ball-and-chain."

20:53.586 --> 20:55.953
No, but that's a good one.

20:55.955 --> 20:56.721
Of course
you're taking his side.

20:56.723 --> 21:01.392
I'm not. I don't think
he's wrong, but I don't think
you're wrong, either.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.095
I've been his wife
almost as long as
he's been working here

21:04.097 --> 21:05.429
and it's never come up,
not once?

21:05.431 --> 21:08.099
It came up with me,
and the world didn't end.

21:08.101 --> 21:08.666
'Cause you kept quiet.

21:08.668 --> 21:12.336
Well, I don't know if you've
noticed, but most things
that aren't my business,

21:12.338 --> 21:14.305
I keep pretty mum about.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.308
You didn't want a picture
of me on your desk?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.676
Honey, no.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.578
-See?
-Because nobody does that.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.015
Kid pictures, fine, but
wife pictures tend to get...

21:24.017 --> 21:25.716
They get decorated.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.751
-Yeah.
-Sexually.

21:26.753 --> 21:29.687
So you want me to bring
in a picture of Bernadette,
that's fine, done.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.690
I want you to want to
put a picture of Bernadette
on your desk.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.592
I want to bring in
a picture of Bernadette.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.860
Whoa, there it is.

21:35.862 --> 21:39.263
Why not? The exposition's
already out of the way.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.798
So are you good for now?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.034
'Cause I think I've got a way
to get Bunchy out.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.902
But I need
the police expertise

21:44.904 --> 21:47.805
of your very charming,
very handsome husband.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.940
See, babe? "Charming."

21:53.413 --> 21:55.279
Keep me informed.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.049
You know, I'm not positive,

21:58.051 --> 22:02.987
but I don't think
I'd get married again
if it cured cancer.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.855
GRACE: <i> He didn't call?</i>

22:04.857 --> 22:06.957
He didn't even leave a message
with the maitre d'.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.860
-Well, maybe he's sick.
-JAMIE: He is.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.262
GRACE: Daddy.
KEN: Jamie.

22:11.264 --> 22:14.432
He's sick to know that
one of his main lieutenants,

22:14.434 --> 22:20.204
major fund-raiser,
trusted confidant,
and future White House counsel

22:20.206 --> 22:22.006
is a degenerate.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.608
What, no probing question

22:24.610 --> 22:29.747
as to why Bob Haldeman might
try to impugn your manhood?

22:29.749 --> 22:30.381
No shocked denial?

22:30.383 --> 22:33.951
No asking your husband
how such a mistake
might happen?

22:33.953 --> 22:37.288
No wondering how much
they know, Ken?

22:37.290 --> 22:39.056
I'll save you
the embarrassing questions.

22:39.058 --> 22:43.227
They know everything,
from your high-school
doubles partner,

22:43.229 --> 22:45.129
the busboy
on your wedding night...

22:45.131 --> 22:48.032
-Enough.
-The hippie freak
who kidnapped Emma,

22:48.034 --> 22:51.669
that South Vietnamese minister
last week.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.740
Every sick secret you thought
you had on lockdown

22:55.742 --> 22:58.509
is in a file
as fat as a phone book!

22:58.511 --> 23:00.244
And when the thing
they care least about is

23:00.246 --> 23:02.546
what a flagrant slut
my daughter is,

23:02.548 --> 23:05.983
what doesn't have to be said
is that every single thing

23:05.985 --> 23:10.588
my family has been
building towards for 19 years

23:10.757 --> 23:11.522
is over.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.258
I'm calling in the loans
on the firm.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.560
You and Hal are terminated.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.629
I hold the mortgage here.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.332
I want you out.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.068
Hope you have some money
in a shoe box.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.903
Daddy, wait.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.006
What are we supposed to do?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.175
(SCOFFS)

23:31.277 --> 23:32.977
My advice?

23:33.212 --> 23:34.478
Become Democrats.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.082
That loser freak show
will throw their arms wide.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.330
I'm looking for Hal Banyin.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.466
Come on in.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.936
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

24:07.413 --> 24:09.680
They're in the bedroom.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.016
It's just this way.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.984
HAL: That's enough!

24:15.087 --> 24:16.787
No! No!

24:18.658 --> 24:20.958
No! No!

24:21.127 --> 24:23.994
No, no!

24:23.996 --> 24:25.229
No!

24:26.732 --> 24:27.965
Enough!

24:28.100 --> 24:29.467
That's enough!

24:31.204 --> 24:32.870
What... What is...

24:32.872 --> 24:36.340
-You want to watch?
They like it.
-HAL: No!

24:37.510 --> 24:38.742
Come in.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.682
HAL: No!

24:44.684 --> 24:45.916
No.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.451
Don't stop.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.820
He's gonna love it.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.657
Hiya, pal. (GRUNTING)

24:54.227 --> 24:55.326
(SCREAMS)

24:55.328 --> 24:57.228
(INHALES DEEPLY)

25:00.700 --> 25:02.733
All that vodka...

25:03.436 --> 25:05.002
When there was this.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.003
What a waste.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.137
You sure you don't want
a little toke?

25:07.139 --> 25:10.941
-Who did you tell?
-That's a tough question, Ken.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.678
Easier question is,
who didn't I tell?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.814
(CHUCKLES) 'Cause...

25:17.149 --> 25:18.549
I told everyone.

25:18.551 --> 25:23.621
Every client,
secretary, reporter,

25:23.956 --> 25:24.755
associate,

25:24.757 --> 25:27.358
(CHUCKLES)
my soon-to-be ex-wife.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.228
Jehovah's Witness
came knocking, told him.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.664
He's not gonna
forget that anytime quick.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.299
(CHUCKLES) Poor kid.

25:35.301 --> 25:38.302
So now I guess I tell
what I know about you,

25:38.304 --> 25:42.172
and we finish the job
of completely
destroying each other.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.173
Really?

25:43.175 --> 25:44.108
You gonna tell about

25:44.110 --> 25:46.443
the dead hooker
you chopped up
and buried, Ken?

25:46.445 --> 25:51.081
-She was yours.
-When she was alive, sure.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.250
But it was all you, Ken.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.218
So go ahead and tell,

25:54.220 --> 25:58.556
'cause boy toys might get you
bounced from the country club,

25:58.558 --> 26:01.292
but a dead girl? Mm?

26:01.294 --> 26:02.626
(CLICKS TONGUE)

26:02.628 --> 26:04.695
That'll get you jail.

26:06.532 --> 26:10.134
-Your word against mine.
-Mm-hmm.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.003
I don't think so.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.106
-Hey, Chuck.
-Hey.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.310
Oh, hey there, Kenny-Ken.

26:24.984 --> 26:25.583
Oh, hey,

26:25.585 --> 26:30.487
Hal's been a real good friend
to us, letting us crash here.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.290
Of course,

26:33.292 --> 26:36.093
Sadie and he have a real bond.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.328
(CHUCKLES)

26:37.330 --> 26:38.596
Sweet deal for everybody.

26:38.598 --> 26:46.003
I can work on my music
without having to, you know,
scramble for food and shelter.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.905
Hal's been generous.

26:48.107 --> 26:53.844
But then the girls are
generous right back, right?

26:54.780 --> 26:58.849
Communal living,
wave of the future.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.751
(LAUGHTER)

27:01.954 --> 27:04.855
Yeah. Hey, Ken...

27:05.691 --> 27:07.691
Bygones, babe.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.627
Okay?

27:11.497 --> 27:13.230
Atta boy.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.436
So, I... I kind of
didn't tell you everything.

27:19.438 --> 27:19.870
He's a cop.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.474
This is a line of work
you should think
about going into yourself.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.242
Would I have to wear shoes?

27:26.012 --> 27:29.313
Can I ask you
how do you keep them so clean?

27:29.315 --> 27:32.383
Top secret hippie voodoo.
Sorry.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.252
So my partner,
is he, what, 80%, 90%?

27:35.254 --> 27:38.422
I need to know, 'cause
work's piling up and he's...

27:38.424 --> 27:40.190
Also he's got some
domestic issues, so...

27:40.192 --> 27:44.428
We're down to
our last session,
so we're closing in on 100%.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.329
Wow.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.131
Thank you, Billi.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.500
And thanks for the tea.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.935
Well, it's tea, right?
What's it called again?

27:51.937 --> 27:53.704
What are you doing tonight?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.606
Mm. Working.

27:55.608 --> 27:56.940
All night?

27:56.942 --> 27:58.676
-Late.
-How late?

27:58.678 --> 28:01.145
If you're not asking
what I think you're asking,

28:01.147 --> 28:05.149
then I pre-apologize,
but if you are, then...

28:05.885 --> 28:08.052
I am too old for you.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.889
Mmm, see, now, I thought
the same thing

28:11.891 --> 28:14.224
but in a kind of
a different way, like...

28:15.094 --> 28:16.660
Are you too old for me?

28:16.662 --> 28:18.262
Do you see
the difference, Sam?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.663
-Yeah, I do.
-Yeah.

28:19.665 --> 28:22.032
Your way, end of discussion.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.702
My way, we find out.

28:26.672 --> 28:27.905
Well...

28:28.140 --> 28:30.107
I'd need you to wear shoes.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.512
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

28:37.650 --> 28:41.552
CHARMAIN: And I'm just
trying to get a wider
view of things, so,

28:41.554 --> 28:45.422
is the Bunchy Carter arrest
one of our operations?

28:45.424 --> 28:48.392
What does that question
have to do with your job?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.127
Like I said, I...

28:50.129 --> 28:53.230
I'd just like to know
what the bigger plan is.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.531
Because?

28:55.768 --> 28:56.200
Because...

28:56.202 --> 28:59.303
Your rabbi Hodiak is looking
to help his buddy Bunchy.

28:59.305 --> 29:03.507
He wants to do something
that's done, it's his choice.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.076
But it's not yours.

29:06.612 --> 29:09.046
Unless I cut you loose,

29:09.248 --> 29:15.185
which I will do
if you ever ask me
another operational question.

29:18.224 --> 29:21.391
You know where this is going.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.261
Yes, sir.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.263
I apologize.

29:27.800 --> 29:32.069
BRIAN: Bust in Laurel Canyon
nine days ago,
pot, speed, coke,

29:32.071 --> 29:35.539
a lot more of that going on,
and 14 tabs of acid,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.374
Blue Unicorn, to be exact.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.109
Found on the Panthers.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.078
-See here?
-Mm-hmm.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.546
And here.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.915
SAM: What about the
actual tabs from Laurel?

29:44.917 --> 29:48.519
Misfiled, I'm told.
But the case
is gonna go fine.

29:48.521 --> 29:51.054
All the other drugs
were accounted for.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.456
And Bunchy's?

29:52.758 --> 29:54.358
Lock and key.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.295
Thank you.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.230
I owe you one.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.635
Quite the opposite, actually.

30:05.571 --> 30:06.937
You were right.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.106
Pass it on.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.361
Hey.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.832
Are you guys sure
you know what you're doing?

31:09.101 --> 31:11.435
What I'm doing is surviving.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.671
What the cops are doing,
that's up to them.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.307
People gonna get hurt
no matter what.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.610
Trick is,
don't be one of them.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.721
GRACE: You need to fix this.
KEN: Fix it how?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.723
They know.
Everyone knows everything.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.690
Everyone always knows.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.493
-Not this.
-This and worse, believe me.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.562
Your father pulled his money.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.331
Daddy is old and scared.
It's making him weak.

31:41.333 --> 31:45.002
He's living in the past.
We are the future, Ken,
you and me.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.104
It's over, Grace.

31:47.172 --> 31:50.974
It is not over. It is not.

31:50.976 --> 31:51.808
This isn't just about you.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.378
I have a future in this party
just as much as you do,

31:54.380 --> 31:56.513
and we are sticking together
to get to that future.

31:56.515 --> 32:01.318
No house, no firm.
Everybody laughing at us,
excommunicated?

32:01.320 --> 32:04.788
Ken, this is...
This is a test.

32:04.790 --> 32:08.926
Did Haldeman tell you
directly it's over? Did he?

32:09.595 --> 32:10.694
-No.
-No.

32:10.696 --> 32:15.899
This is a warning
and a punishment,
but it is not the end,

32:16.101 --> 32:17.601
for either of us.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.468
Screw Daddy.

32:18.470 --> 32:23.240
I have my trust and...
And the property
in Santa Barbara.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.108
I know you hid money overseas.

32:25.110 --> 32:25.809
We'll barely miss a step.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.713
So, what, we beg and threaten,
and I get a scrap
of what I'm owed,

32:29.715 --> 32:33.850
and you get to be
assistant committee
chairwoman?

32:33.852 --> 32:35.085
For now.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.154
We keep fighting.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.790
We make them need us.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.793
I'm just so tired.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.632
Ken,

32:48.834 --> 32:51.902
what we have to
offer the party,

32:52.037 --> 32:55.005
this country, matters.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.774
But we have to do it together.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.509
Ken, look at me.

32:59.912 --> 33:04.748
I don't love you,
and you don't love me,
and that's a relief,

33:04.750 --> 33:06.984
because we want
the same things.

33:06.986 --> 33:11.922
So, as long as we are both
discreet in private

33:12.157 --> 33:14.825
and together in public,

33:15.694 --> 33:17.794
nothing can stop us.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.197
And what happens then, Grace?

33:20.199 --> 33:25.769
We have all this power,
but what kind of people
are we?

33:25.771 --> 33:28.205
Our daughter locked away,
for what?

33:28.207 --> 33:32.409
Ken, do you know
when it's time to let go
of your children?

33:34.146 --> 33:37.647
When you don't
recognize them anymore.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.685
That's the time
you let go of anyone.

33:50.429 --> 33:54.531
Becky Goodale has a rental
in Bel Air that's empty.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.534
I'll move in there this week.

33:58.237 --> 34:02.472
Brez, I love a good frame-up,
I do, but this is just sloppy.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.075
I don't get it, Sam.

34:05.077 --> 34:07.444
I mean, him, sure.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.311
The wife and all.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.946
Ooh. I would tread
carefully here.

34:09.948 --> 34:13.183
But you, you know
what these animals are after.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.052
They need to be put down.

34:15.054 --> 34:15.919
Brez, Brez, Brez.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.622
I'm doing you a favor here.
Just stop and walk away.

34:18.624 --> 34:22.259
You threw a punch.
He defended himself.
Walk away.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.760
Or you're taking this to IA.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.128
Me, IA? No.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.530
I am.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.932
Well, then you're
gonna get fired.

34:28.934 --> 34:29.900
And then it's gonna
be in the papers,

34:29.902 --> 34:34.771
and then you're gonna
have the Panthers marching
outside your house until...

34:34.773 --> 34:35.305
Forever.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.674
All right, now, you tried to
do a favor for the Red Squad.

34:37.676 --> 34:41.211
You screwed up.
You got sloppy.
Now walk away.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.879
You're right.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.415
I couldn't care less
about any of this.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.452
And I'm glad to get
some breaking news on you.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.352
Really? What's that?

34:49.354 --> 34:51.254
You like your
officer brothers,

34:51.256 --> 34:54.391
-but you love you some...
-(GRUNTS)

34:56.895 --> 34:57.627
Brez.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.362
That's not the same eye,
is it?

34:59.364 --> 35:00.764
He got the same eye?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.935
Brez, you really got to learn
to keep your hands up.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.503
HAL: (GRUNTING)
Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.504
-Doesn't it hurt?
-SADIE: It kills.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.340
-HAL: A little bit, yeah.
-SADIE:
That's the point, right?

35:10.342 --> 35:10.640
Yeah.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.742
-SADIE: What?
You want it harder?
-Yeah.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.478
-(FLUID SLOSHES)
-Wait. Why'd you stop?

35:14.480 --> 35:15.979
-Did you hurt him?
-HAL: What?

35:15.981 --> 35:17.948
-No. No, that's hers.
-No.

35:17.950 --> 35:18.915
I need to go to the hospital.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.217
-Why?
-PATTY: But Charlie said
no hospital.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.019
I don't care. I need to go
to the hospital now.

35:23.021 --> 35:23.954
Okay. Okay.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.222
HAL: Guys, but you...

35:25.224 --> 35:27.124
Sadie, you can't...

35:27.659 --> 35:29.392
<i> Hello?</i>

35:34.233 --> 35:35.465
Ken.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.667
Detective.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.938
Thank you.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.976
I wasn't sure
if I could do this alone.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.612
I didn't know
who else to call.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.714
Ironic.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.785
Well, there's some papers
ready to be signed, so...

35:55.787 --> 35:57.220
But...

35:57.356 --> 35:58.088
It's just...

35:58.090 --> 36:00.357
-What?
-There was a decision made,

36:00.359 --> 36:03.660
and no one will say
who made it.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.495
Is Emma all right?

36:06.031 --> 36:08.698
She's had
electroshock therapy.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.035
You can ask her doctors
about the details.

36:12.037 --> 36:14.804
But apparently
she's not quite herself,

36:14.806 --> 36:18.108
and recovery
can take some time.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.911
It could be permanent?

36:22.147 --> 36:24.881
You have to talk
to her doctors

36:25.551 --> 36:27.217
about that.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.491
KEN: I'll pull up the car.

36:34.493 --> 36:38.595
I'll just be a minute,
then I'm taking you home.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.897
Home.

36:43.969 --> 36:48.838
We're gonna get you
all well again, my sweet girl.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.174
All well.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.815
He's my father, isn't he?

36:59.585 --> 37:00.650
Yes.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.352
He's nice.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.653
Yeah.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.856
Oh, Emma, I want to

37:06.858 --> 37:08.358
give you something.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.162
You're giving this to me?

37:12.164 --> 37:13.964
SAM: Yeah.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.168
To keep?

37:19.271 --> 37:20.503
Yeah.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.674
I forgot your name.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.443
Sam.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.913
Sam, it's beautiful.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.883
It feels like

37:34.786 --> 37:36.019
love.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.223
Why am I crying?

37:41.493 --> 37:44.828
I think those are
happy tears, Emma.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.863
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)

37:51.603 --> 37:53.536
KEN: All right, here we go.

BUNCHY: <i> What do we mean</i>
<i> when we say "the Man"?</i>

38:16.328 --> 38:18.695
We mean the Beast.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.964
That is what the Man is.

38:21.333 --> 38:25.168
<i> That is how the Man</i>
<i> must be dealt with.</i>

38:28.874 --> 38:33.410
<i> You train a beast,</i>
<i> or you kill a beast.</i>

38:33.745 --> 38:35.845
There are no other options.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.581
Train or kill.

38:38.583 --> 38:42.018
Both involve discipline
of purpose,

38:42.554 --> 38:45.121
<i> seriousness of intent,</i>

38:46.758 --> 38:50.527
loyalty of our

38:50.529 --> 38:52.696
and unleashing of violence.

we are armed.

-(PEOPLE MURMURING)
-MAN: That's right.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.584
BUNCHY: This is the only
relationship respected
by the Man,

39:14.586 --> 39:20.323
because it is the only form
of relationship
understood by the Man.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.792
From this point forward,

39:22.794 --> 39:27.063
we are a military organization
not in defense of our lives,

39:27.065 --> 39:29.566

it was nice.

Eh. (SIGHS)

40:05.771 --> 40:07.537
Is your mother single?

40:07.539 --> 40:09.439
Um, she acts like it, but, no.

40:09.441 --> 40:12.308
-Oh, even better.
-Sorry.

40:15.781 --> 40:16.713
Oh, come on.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.649
Well, this is what comes
from not having any hobbies.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.020

40:49.781 --> 40:53.650
Well, find out.
I'll be right there.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.358
-Yes?
-Hey there, friend.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.662
I'm looking for Terry Melcher
and Dennis Wilson,
if he's here, too.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.030
I'm sorry,
but I'm not sure if...

41:07.032 --> 41:11.000
Look, whatever they're doing,
tell them to
stop now and listen.

41:11.002 --> 41:15.038
This is the Revelation,
the end of days,
beginning of all time.

41:15.040 --> 41:15.738

Hey, tell Dennis I ain't mad.
I get it, I get it.

41:18.844 --> 41:19.909
The Beach Boys
are a corporate asset.

41:19.911 --> 41:23.413
What they done to my song,
that's just business,
but this,

41:23.415 --> 41:26.282
the Beatles, is prophecy.

41:26.451 --> 41:29.185
And I am their instrument.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.455
Dennis and Terry
are gonna know that
the second they hear.

41:32.457 --> 41:35.425
I'm sorry. Terry doesn't
live here anymore.

41:35.427 --> 41:37.360
Hey, there, hell flower. Uh...

41:37.362 --> 41:40.930
-Do you know where he is?
-I'm sorry, I don't.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.333
Could I maybe use your phone?

41:43.335 --> 41:47.504
-I'm Charlie.
I'm a friend of Dennis's.
-Hi.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.305
We're in the middle
of a shoot, but...

It wouldn't take more than
two shakes of a lamb's tail.

Okay, I'll get the phone.

-All right, thanks.
-No.

41:56.348 --> 41:59.082
-You need to go now.
-Well, the lady said yes...

41:59.084 --> 42:01.084
We'll tell Terry
if we see him.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.752
Ciao.
