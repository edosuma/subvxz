00:05.606 --> 00:07.575
JARED:
Dude, this yacht

00:07.608 --> 00:09.243
is off the hook.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.779
Jacuzzi, 4K TV.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.781
Thing's even got a tanning bed.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.184
The only thing
it's missing is...

00:17.685 --> 00:20.154
Oh. Never mind.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.722
Wish me luck.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.127
Door's open.

00:28.729 --> 00:32.333
* Sex and lies and videotape

00:32.366 --> 00:35.769
* Sex and lies
and videotape *

00:35.803 --> 00:40.508
* Sex, lies and videotape...

00:40.541 --> 00:44.345
Wow. Happy birthday to me.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.647
Call for a date?

00:46.680 --> 00:47.848
Mm-mm.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.317
One hour, cash up-front.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.751
Then we talk
about your birthday.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.853
We're done talking.
Why don't you give

00:52.886 --> 00:54.588
the birthday boy
a kiss

00:54.622 --> 00:57.158
Okay, well, why don't
we start with a drink, huh?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.792
Well, I've been
drinking all day.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.828
What I could use...

01:00.861 --> 01:02.830
is a massage.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.665
How about
a broken jaw instead, huh?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.367
Uh... Who the hell are you?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.669
Uh, nobody-- what are you
doing here, Luis?

01:08.702 --> 01:10.238
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?!

01:10.271 --> 01:12.706
I'm workin'.
Wait, you know this guy?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.308
Yeah, I'm her boyfriend.
No-- he's my ex...

01:14.342 --> 01:15.643
boyfriend.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.178
Oh, boy.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.712
Buddy, take a hike.
I got to talk to my girl.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.813
Charlie, come here.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.549
Dude, this is my boat.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.384
How about you
take a hike?
Dude.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.853
This is not your boat.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.388
Well, actually, it's a rental.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.689
Homie, do you realize that now,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.824
I have to beat
the hell out of you?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.493
That wasn't mentioned in the ad.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.728
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.530
You give me
no alternative, buddy.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.266
Wait, wait, hold on. I-I didn't
even touch your girlfriend.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.433
Ex-girlfriend.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.768
Whatever. Uh...

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
Here. Money, okay?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.705
Here, take it,

01:44.738 --> 01:46.174
and get out of
here, both of you.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.709
I don't want any problems.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.678
Charlie, come here. Charlie!
No.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.381
TORRES: Charlie,
don't walk away from me.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.848
Come on, just give me
another chance.

01:54.882 --> 01:55.816
BISHOP:
Cool it, De Niro,

01:55.849 --> 01:57.518
we're out of earshot.
Charlie.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.852
:
I need you, Charlie.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.221
I need you.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.489
:
Did we get it?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.224
Uh-huh.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.792
Nice.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.827
*

02:43.497 --> 02:45.799
BISHOP:
All right.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.236
Uploading Turner's cell phone.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.637
McGee, you getting this?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.804
McGEE:
So far, so good.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.606
It should just
take a minute, boss.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.741
Any problems?
TORRES:
Well, aside from Bishop

02:53.774 --> 02:54.908
almost blowing up our cover,

02:54.942 --> 02:57.245
no, we're pretty good.
Excuse me?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.846
You shouldn't have
slapped his hand away.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.314
I don't give out free samples.

03:00.348 --> 03:03.183
I got three kids to feed,
and a sick nana in Boca.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.819
What? You told me
to have a backstory.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.221
That's my backstory.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.489
No, that's actually,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.358
that's actually pretty good.
Thank you.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.792
What's wrong with Nana?
BISHOP: Shingles.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.694
Condolences. McGee?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.863
McGEE:
All right, upload is complete.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.831
I have mirrored Turner's cell,
so that we should be able

03:17.865 --> 03:19.833
to listen in on
any calls he makes.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.702
I thought we were
bringing him in.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.304
We got a thousand grams
of fentanyl

03:23.337 --> 03:25.306
being smuggled onto the base
every month.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.974
Families are being torn apart.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.509
SECNAV wants it stopped.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.710
TORRES:
Director, uh, Jared Turner

03:29.743 --> 03:31.011
is just a street dealer.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.880
Uh, the better play here
is to tail him.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.715
Find out where
he's getting the drugs from.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.584
All we know right now is that
they're being smuggled in

03:36.617 --> 03:37.718
from Norfolk's civilian marina.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.853
Actually,
we may know something else.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.422
Turner's getting a text.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.391
From who?

03:43.424 --> 03:44.558
No idea. It's a burn phone.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.859
But the message is a heads-up.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
It says someone's coming
to buy drugs,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.597
but the sender wants Turner
to put a bullet

03:49.630 --> 03:50.764
in their head, instead.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.667
So if we intervene,
we-we blow our op.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.768
So I'm assuming we...

03:54.802 --> 03:56.704
Intervene. Can't
let a murder happen.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.871
Right. Yeah, no.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.640
That's totally what I was...

03:59.673 --> 04:01.609
Yeah.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.780
So, how's this
gonna do down?

04:06.814 --> 04:07.881
I take the stern,
you take the bow?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.817
No. We do the
Torres Triple Play.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.785
No, please, not another
undercover story.

04:11.819 --> 04:15.389
I was midtown, working
undercover at a clock factory...

04:15.423 --> 04:17.057
Any more texts?
No, not yet,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.792
but I am running
a trace on the...

04:44.618 --> 04:46.354
REEVES:
What is it?

04:46.387 --> 04:47.888
That's a heel.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.525
McGee

04:51.559 --> 04:53.361
No, still nothing.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.596
I've tried Torres's burn phone
ten times.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.897
You text Bishop?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.699
Yeah, her burn phone,
her home phone,

04:58.732 --> 05:00.067
Snapchat account, nothing.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.469
Well, I viewed the tapes.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.570
Didn't seem like
they had enough time

05:02.603 --> 05:04.605
to make it to the boat
before it blew.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.839
So then, where are they?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.875
MAN:
We got a body!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.580
Yeah, go ahead and tie off.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.659
I'll text Palmer.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.061
Looks like he was pretty close
to the source of the explosion.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.664
Yeah, I don't think
that's what killed him.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.600
McGEE: Looks like someone
shot him point-blank.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.636
And wasn't Turner the one
ordered to do the hit?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.438
Looks like something went wrong.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.639
MAN:
Sorry, sir, dock's closed.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.541
I have a right to be here.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.610
Are you gonna
let me through, G.I. Joe?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.612
This is a civilian marina.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.614
Thank you.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.581
So I guess you're in charge?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
Yeah. Special Agent Gibbs...

05:49.850 --> 05:51.952
NCIS.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.854
You own the boat
that was docked here?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.489
I own four boats in this marina.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.724
Three.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.158
What the hell
happened to my boat?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.894
You tell us.
I don't know.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.896
I rented Chloe out yesterday
to some punk kid.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.398
When I find him,
I'm gonna kill him.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.999
Too late.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.538
If you knew he was a punk kid,

06:10.571 --> 06:11.972
why would you rent
him your boat?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.474
Because his money was green.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.877
He actually was
kind of a nice kid.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.679
Was anyone with him?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.980
Well, I know who wasn't.
Boss, look at this.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.683
Just got this text
From Bishop's burn phone.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.139
Rough night?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.809
Gibbs, I know protocol says, uh,
we should've reported in.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.711
Which I reminded him
of a dozen times.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.079
Two dozen times.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.747
But when an op goes sideways
like that,

06:53.781 --> 06:56.584
you stay down
until you know which end is up.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.453
And he calls that bit of wisdom
the Torres Two-Step.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.788
You done?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.956
VANCE: Well, looks like
I didn't miss much.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.958
Sorry I'm late.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.695
I, uh, got stuck on the Hill.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.162
Director...?
I'm here for a sitrep.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.599
And since the mountain
won't come to Muhammad...

07:11.632 --> 07:13.667
What happened?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.603
I don't know.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.171
We were walking towards
the boat, and then...

07:18.205 --> 07:20.474
The next we knew,
we were flat on our asses.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.909
Slipped away from the base,

07:21.942 --> 07:24.478
found a spot to hole up.
Spent the whole night, uh,

07:24.512 --> 07:26.580
searching
Jared Turner's cell phone.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.215
We know where
he's getting his drugs from.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.750
We need to go back in.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.685
Only place you're going
is the hospital.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.120
I'm sorry, guys,
but we didn't spend two weeks

07:33.153 --> 07:34.822
backstopping
our identities just...

07:34.855 --> 07:36.657
just so we can walk away.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.726
Yeah, Gibbs, we're-we're fine.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.661
You don't look fine.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.630
Yeah, and for all we know,
you two have been made.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.533
Okay.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.503
Oh.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.505
Oh, you're serious.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.574
I don't get made,

07:53.607 --> 07:55.676
Director.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.077
With all due respect.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.580
And Gibbs just told you
to report to the hospital.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.581
BISHOP:
Yeah, but...

08:00.614 --> 08:03.116
All due respect.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.653
All right.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.688
Let's go, Muhammad.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.564
Wait a minute,
I'm Muhammad, right?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.233
McGEE:
Jared Turner, 32 years old,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.802
with a record a mile long.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.705
Petty theft, some B and E,
small-time dope dealing.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.206
Not small-time anymore.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.208
He's making enough
dealing to rent a yacht.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.678
And thanks to Bishop and Torres
cloning his phone,

08:30.711 --> 08:32.680
we now know who's supplying him
with the drugs.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.682
REEVES: Mitchell Young.
Runs a boating supply store

08:34.715 --> 08:36.550
at Norfolk's
civilian marina.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.852
McGEE: And we've got texts
going back for months

08:38.886 --> 08:40.320
discussing pickups
and drop-offs.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.388
REEVE: Bet they ain't
talking about bait or tackle.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.991
Must be where the fentanyl's
coming in.
He the boss?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.693
REEVES: Seems more like
middle-management.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.160
But we're getting
closer to the top.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
All right, let's pick him up.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.301
It doesn't really look

08:54.334 --> 08:56.069
like a hotbed for
drug distribution.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.138
Well, that's why they call it
a front, McGee.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.173
Hold on a second.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.147
Wait, isn't Torres
supposed to be at the hospital?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.616
Yes.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.053
So he's disobeying
a direct order?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.255
Yes.

09:15.288 --> 09:19.326
Your driver's license says
it's from Maine, huh?
Mm-hmm.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.929
MITCHELL: It's beautiful
this time of year. Remind me,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.632
what was the capital, again,
of that fine state?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.835
Nice try, ladies.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.674
So do you still want the, uh,
fidget spinners?
GIRL: Well, we tried.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.076
Augusta.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.045
Excuse me?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.881
Augusta, man, that's the, uh,
capital of Maine.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.083
Ah.
Yeah, I'm straight
in the beer department.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.752
So what can I do for you?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.153
Ooh, that's not
the question, player.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.989
The question is,
"What can I do for you?"

09:53.193 --> 09:55.629
What's that?

09:55.663 --> 09:57.798
That is a clone
of Jared Turner's cell phone.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.670
My girlfriend snagged it
last night.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.137
I'm listening.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.874
We've been running the same con
for years, right?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
You know,
she poses as an escort,

10:08.942 --> 10:11.745
yeah, she clones
the-the marks' cell phone,

10:11.779 --> 10:13.647
and then, uh,
we use that information

10:13.681 --> 10:15.415
to steal the guy's identity.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.818
Smart.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.853
How you guys making out?
Not as well as you.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.956
And go ahead
and put the gun back.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.327
I'm not here
to blackmail you, man.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.431
So what do you want?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.001
I want a job.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.179
Agent Torres,
you disobeyed a direct order.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.915
Thought it was more
like a suggestion.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.017
That's not the direction
you want to go in.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.019
Fine. How about this?

10:52.052 --> 10:55.055
I made a choice.
GIBBS: Not your call
to make, Nick.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.424
Put you and your partner
at risk.
And it paid off.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.226
Mitchell Young offered
both Bishop and me

10:59.259 --> 11:00.894
a job on his crew.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.196
So... what,
now two of my best agents

11:03.230 --> 11:04.898
are gonna be spending their time

11:04.932 --> 11:06.734
going up and down the boardwalk
selling drugs?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.803
Well, it's a step up
from a hooker and her pimp.
Easy, killer.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.806
Gibbs, this Mitchell guy

11:12.840 --> 11:15.242
is higher on the food chain
than Turner was.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.079
We are a step away from
the ringleader, and I know it.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.114
Director, do you want to
bring down a drug ring or not?

11:21.148 --> 11:23.216
Overdoses on the base
are climbing.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.085
People are dying;
our friends are dying.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.854
We don't have
a lot of leads here.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.221
Actually, our divers
just recovered the gun

11:28.255 --> 11:29.957
that was used
to kill Jared Turner.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.092
The serial number's
been filed off.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.765
You knew he was gonna do this,
didn't you?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.903
Are we all good?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.839
No. You're about as far
from good as possible.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.142
And I'll deal with your
insubordination later.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.311
But for now, yeah...

11:51.344 --> 11:53.881
you're good enough.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.888
Did you really know
I was gonna do that?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.859
:
And then he left me

12:05.893 --> 12:07.761
at the hospital,

12:07.795 --> 12:10.030
while he went back in alone

12:10.063 --> 12:12.099
to restart our investigation.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.433
Okay, you know what?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.036
We are good.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.139
Mm-hmm. Thank you
for all of your help.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.074
I-I actually, uh...

12:21.108 --> 12:23.276
already had enough bullets
to confirm that

12:23.310 --> 12:25.813
that is our murder weapon.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.548
Sorry. I'm just... pissed.
Couldn't tell.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.818
Look, I'm sure
that Torres feels terrible

12:30.851 --> 12:32.052
about what he did.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.087
Ooh, I'm the man.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.190
The director just approved...

12:37.224 --> 12:38.926
Be glad I took the gun.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.560
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.462
Bishop! Hold on, hold on.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.464
Oh, now you have
time for me, Nick?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.000
Something wrong?

12:47.034 --> 12:50.137
Yeah. I thought we were a team.
We are.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.905
But I saw an opportunity,
so I took it.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.141
Well, that wasn't really
your decision to make.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.342
It was better
that you didn't know.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.444
Oh, really?
Better for who, Nick?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.079
Look, maybe
I screwed up.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.548
But when you're undercover,
things move fast,

13:01.581 --> 13:03.984
and you're forced to do things
that you normally wouldn't do.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.819
And you do it because...
because it feels right,

13:05.853 --> 13:06.987
because you're in the zone,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.421
because you
just have to.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.257
And at the end
of the day,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.559
that's how you stay alive.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.001
Just wanted to...
capture the moment.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.302
Oh.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.971
And to tell you that the gun

13:24.004 --> 13:26.073
our divers found
is, in fact,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.075
the gun that killed
Jared Turner.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.010
Any luck I.D.'ing the owner?

13:30.043 --> 13:33.380
Well, you know the serial
number was filed off the gun,

13:33.413 --> 13:35.983
but you also know...
That you're a genius?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.585
Thanks. I didn't want
to have to... say it myself.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.188
So, earlier this morning,
I tried this new technique.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.257
It's called electron
backscatter diffraction,

13:44.291 --> 13:46.860
and it images, like,
individual atoms...

13:46.894 --> 13:50.263
So how much technobabble
do you want to hear?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.531
Is zero an option?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.466
Yes. Our murder weapon

13:53.500 --> 13:56.436
is registered to...

13:56.469 --> 13:59.072
Denise Mancuso.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.141
She's a science
teacher on the base.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.144
BISHOP: She looks more like
band camp than badass.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.113
Now, I also
have an address.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.515
All right,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.017
well, send it to McGee.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.851
Torres and I have to go
sell some dope.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.628
Well...

14:21.661 --> 14:24.031
that explains the
thumping sound.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.133
Sorry about that, my friend.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.070
I normally use the bag
to clear my mind, but...

14:30.103 --> 14:31.638
I have plans tonight,

14:31.671 --> 14:34.207
and I don't want to sweat.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.009
Not yet.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.211
I assume you're here
about our murder suspect.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.281
I got to say, this woman Denise

14:41.314 --> 14:44.151
is about as squeaky clean
as they get.
Mm.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.253
Ninth grade science teacher,
PTA mom.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.089
Hardly someone who would be
involved in a drug ring.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.224
That's not why I'm here.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.225
Hmm.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.095
No, I'm good.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.230
You don't look so good, Leon.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.665
Take a load off.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.370
Huh.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
Oh.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.040
Let me guess.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.077
Agent Torres?
You're wondering

15:10.110 --> 15:12.145
if you can trust him
after he ignored your orders.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.280
No, actually, now I'm wondering

15:13.313 --> 15:15.048
if I'm that easy to read.
Listen,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.050
this isn't the first time
Agent Torres defied orders,

15:17.084 --> 15:19.119
but this is the first time
you've been in my office.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.422
Yeah, but this time
he took it too far.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.992
I'm afraid Agent Bishop
may pay the price.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.260
He's a lot to handle.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.596
We trained him to follow his gut
and take chances,

15:29.629 --> 15:32.199
and that's what he did,
and it turned out to be

15:32.232 --> 15:34.101
the right move.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.438
Sound familiar, Director?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.273
Gibbs.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.175
Well, that's...

15:42.209 --> 15:44.511
that's just great-- that's
all I need is two of them.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.047
Here.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.253
I'll take a yellow one.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.354
Thanks, Jack.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.523
See you later.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.027
Are you kidding me?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.528
This is a joke, right?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.131
Sorry, Mr. Lane, this is
all I'm authorized to do.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.433
I lost a million-dollar
yacht on your dock,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.136
and all you're gonna comp me
is two scuba tanks?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.304
Where's Mitchell?
Out on a dive.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.273
He'll be back at 4:30.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.308
Then I'll be back at 4:30.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.545
What up, what up?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
So, where is
Mitchell, really?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.016
Let me guess.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.118
You're the new guys?
And you are...?

16:25.152 --> 16:27.154
Donnie. Mitchell's assistant.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.688
He's in the back.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.090
Go wait by that door.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.192
I'll let you know
when he's ready.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.660
No, not you.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.262
Just her.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.496
You already had your interview.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.031
Wherever she
goes, I go.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.300
It's okay, baby.
I'll be fine.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.036
Why don't you pick out
a new suit for me

16:43.070 --> 16:45.138
while you're waiting.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.111
Ready to get to work?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.580
Uh... yeah.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.548
She has enough bathing suits.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.218
All right, so what
are we doing, huh?

16:58.251 --> 16:59.252
Dropping off

16:59.286 --> 17:01.254
Sort of. You see those tanks?

17:01.288 --> 17:03.223
Yeah.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.093
Well, we got to carry them
out to the truck.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.128
They need to be
hydrostatically tested.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.164
I'm sorry... it sounds like
you're asking me to, um...

17:11.198 --> 17:13.200
lift stuff.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.369
Uh, that's not
what I signed up for.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.105
Yeah, you and me both.
But somebody's got to do it.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.540
Besides, the last guy blew up.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.244
McGEE:
I picked her up

17:24.277 --> 17:25.612
at the school
science fair.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.148
She was baking cookies
in a solar oven.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.216
Cookies?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.084
Mint chip.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.419
We sure Abby's got
the right person here?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.520
She hardly seems

17:33.553 --> 17:35.288
like a homicidal arsonist to me.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.357
You think?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.758
I-I know why I'm here.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.693
And I could totally
explain everything.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.794
It's actually quite funny.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.331
Mm.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.432
Uh...

17:45.465 --> 17:47.134
uh...

17:47.167 --> 17:51.771
one of my students needed a
fake I.D. for a practical joke.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.107
I-I'm pretty good with
Photoshop, so I...

17:54.141 --> 17:56.609
Not why you're here.
Oh.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.146
Is this about the cannabis
in the school greenhouse?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.447
I have a card.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.115
It allows me
to grow up to...

18:02.149 --> 18:04.451
It's not about the cannabis
in the school greenhouse.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.854
I'm... just gonna...

18:07.887 --> 18:10.123
stop talking now.
Good idea.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.126
You know this man?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.196
No.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.202
How about now?

18:22.235 --> 18:25.205
What's going on?
What's going on
is it looks like

18:25.238 --> 18:27.774
you snuck aboard Jared Turner's
boat two days ago,

18:27.807 --> 18:29.576
put a bullet in his head.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.145
Started a fire
to cover up the murder.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.281
You can't be serious.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.053
That your weapon?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.326
Then we're serious.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.728
That gun was stolen
over a year ago.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.230
Did you report it?

18:50.263 --> 18:51.764
No.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.533
Why not?
Because it was stolen

18:53.566 --> 18:55.235
by my sister-in-law.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.271
As much as I despise
that crazy bitch,

18:58.305 --> 18:59.439
family is family.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.907
That crazy bitch have a name?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.376
Yeah. Frankie.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.545
Frankie Mancuso.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.347
Who wears a
Red Fang T-shirt

19:07.380 --> 19:10.317
to a family
Christmas party?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.188
Yeah, we're moving
about a kilo a month

19:15.222 --> 19:18.191
but there's always room
for improvement.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.393
Yeah, I'm interested.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.233
BISHOP :
Any day now.
Door's open.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.248
So, you wanted
to talk to me, or just...

19:41.281 --> 19:43.350
stare at me like an idiot?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.951
Feisty.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.786
I see why he likes you.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.688
Yeah, well,
I'm a very likable person.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.324
I'm glad that's settled.
We done now?
No.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.227
This is a job interview.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.963
I thought I already had the job.
Your boyfriend vouched
for you, yeah.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.567
And I had him checked out--
he's the real deal. But, uh...

20:00.600 --> 20:04.371
I need to see
what you got for myself.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.075
Take a seat.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.747
Okay.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.584
So am I filling out a W

20:17.617 --> 20:19.286
Not quite.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.257
Anyone who works for me

20:24.291 --> 20:27.260
has got to understand
two things.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.796
One...

20:29.829 --> 20:31.964
I'm 100% loyal to my crew.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.032
And two...

20:33.065 --> 20:35.968
I expect the same
thing in return.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.006
Don't I, Frankie?

20:40.039 --> 20:43.376
I swear... I just went
to the yacht trying to score.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.646
You shot my best earner.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.348
Jared pulled a gun on me.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
He was gonna kill me.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.518
What was I
supposed to do?

20:51.551 --> 20:54.454
Die?

20:55.822 --> 20:58.291
Like I said...

20:58.325 --> 20:59.959
loyalty.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.929
Your boyfriend
proved himself

21:02.962 --> 21:05.031
when he returned
our stolen property.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.805
Now it's your turn.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.357
MITCHELL:
In case it wasn't clear,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.091
I'd like you
to shoot this woman.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.726
:
Mitchie, please.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.562
You want her dead,
you shoot her.
It's simple.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.030
You want to work for me,
you got to get your hands dirty.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.400
And if I don't?

21:41.634 --> 21:44.504
You don't want to find out.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.775
And I don't got all day.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.844
FRANKIE:
No.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.584
MITCHELL:
Oh. One more thing.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.586
Don't miss.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.521
There's only one bullet.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.423
In case you get any ideas.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.595
What the hell?

22:10.597 --> 22:11.664
TORRES:
Yo, we got to go.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.701
Some kids set off
the fire alarm.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did I miss something?

22:16.903 --> 22:18.838
Just tying up a loose end.
Do it.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.607
Fine. Whatever.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.878
What are you doing, Luis?
What, are you crazy?

22:25.912 --> 22:27.780
The base fire department
is on its way over.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.382
Can't get caught
with a dead body.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.950
We can't get caught
with a live one, either.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.653
Come on, man. We're not shooting
anyone on base. Think.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.587
BISHOP:
So we take her off base,

22:34.621 --> 22:36.022
put a bullet in her head
and dump the body.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.790
TORRES: Um...

22:37.824 --> 22:39.426
yeah.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.594
What she said.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.499
REEVES: McGee's checking out
her apartment.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.734
Still no word
on the BOLO.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.168
No one can find her.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.538
Gibbs.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.940
Yeah. Think I found her.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.608
Whoa, whoa. Bishop?

22:55.642 --> 22:56.843
He was the one who was
supplying Jared with drugs.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.545
Bishop, slow down.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.846
I'm supposed to kill her.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.014
BISHOP: Plan is to put
a bullet in her head

23:02.048 --> 23:04.183
and dump the body.
Is there a plan B?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.185
Then I send the photos
to Donnie's burn phone

23:06.218 --> 23:07.620
to prove I did it.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.921
You okay, Bishop?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.557
Oh, I'm better than okay.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.526
Who knew dropping bodies
could be such a rush.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.528
Dropping bodies?

23:15.562 --> 23:16.863
You know I can hear you, right?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.532
I can totally see
why Torres likes this

23:19.566 --> 23:20.600
undercover work so much.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.968
Get a sitrep on Torres.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.436
He stayed behind, hasn't seen

23:23.470 --> 23:24.771
any drugs yet, but...

23:24.804 --> 23:26.639
at least
he's getting a good workout.

23:26.673 --> 23:27.840
You're a cop?!

23:27.874 --> 23:29.542
You almost shot me!

23:29.576 --> 23:32.979
I got to go, Gibbs.
Company.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.714
Special Agent Eleanor Bishop,
and no,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.849
I didn't almost shoot you.
Really?

23:36.883 --> 23:38.084
Then what do you call
putting a gun

23:38.117 --> 23:39.452
to my head
and pulling the trigger?

23:39.486 --> 23:40.653
Well, that is what's called

23:40.687 --> 23:42.054
the Torres Trick-Fire.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.690
See, Agent Torres
was working undercover

23:43.723 --> 23:45.992
when his partner was
ordered to shoot someone.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.595
In order to bail him out,
he triggered the fire alarm,

23:48.628 --> 23:51.498
knocked the gun away
at the last second.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.833
I knew what he was doing.
What?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.668
Your life was never in danger.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.170
It was a little in danger.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.073
Well, it doesn't really
matter anyway, because...

24:01.107 --> 24:03.209
I'm still gonna
have to kill you.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.080
All right, got it.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.849
BISHOP: Perfect.
I'll send them to Donnie.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.818
Nice work, Abbs.
ABBY: Thank you.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.886
The trick is using real blood.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.989
Just kidding. Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.225
And then?
BISHOP:
And then

24:19.258 --> 24:21.060
you make a statement
about the shooting,

24:21.093 --> 24:23.095
and hope we believe
it was self-defense.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.498
But first, we need you
to tell us everything you know

24:25.532 --> 24:27.634
about the drug ring,
starting with who's running it.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.168
If I was gonna tell you that,
we could have just skipped

24:29.201 --> 24:30.670
the makeup job.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.672
Hold that thought.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.743
You wanted
to see me?

24:36.776 --> 24:39.111
Yeah. So,
we've offered our witness

24:39.145 --> 24:40.813
every deal
in the book, and...

24:40.847 --> 24:42.549
she's still
not talking.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.751
I was hoping since you
built a profile on her,

24:44.784 --> 24:46.252
you might have some insight?

24:46.285 --> 24:47.987
You thought right.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.657
With this one, you
don't use a carrot.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.659
You want to
use a stick.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.827
Look, I told you,
I'm not a snitch.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.665
You sure about that?

25:02.802 --> 25:05.304
Pretty. Okay.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.640
Which photo

25:07.674 --> 25:10.643
would you like us to send
your pal down at the marina?

25:10.677 --> 25:14.013
This one... or this one?

25:14.046 --> 25:15.648
Hmm?

25:15.682 --> 25:17.016
TORRES:
Yo, man, how many more

25:17.049 --> 25:19.285
scuba tanks?
My back is killing me.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.320
Uh, one more load.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.590
What?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.324
And then what?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.760
Please tell me it's, uh,
it's something illegal.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.898
Uh, inventory.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.668
Somebody's got
to do it.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.737
And we got to clean
the bait freezer, mop the floor.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.873
Then Mitchell's gonna
load you up with some products,

25:40.907 --> 25:42.775
see if you can earn your keep.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.314
Is that what happens
when you don't?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.318
Ah, she wasn't part of the crew.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.587
She's just a customer.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.591
Didn't mean any harm.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.159
What happened?

26:00.192 --> 26:02.228
Got in too deep.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.697
Owed too much.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.834
Became a liability.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.236
Well, that's the
business we chose, right?

26:10.269 --> 26:13.072
Not the business I chose.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.107
No, this business chose me.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.011
I wanted to be a fireman.
Oh.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.615
Then I grew up,
and I wanted to be a teacher.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.350
Hell, I even thought
about being a cop.

26:24.383 --> 26:27.854
Wait. Like a... like
a police officer cop?

26:27.887 --> 26:30.256
:
Yeah, like a cop cop.

26:30.289 --> 26:33.159
It's hard to imagine, huh?

26:33.192 --> 26:36.095
And then...
then my mom got sick.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.797
You know,
she didn't have insurance

26:37.830 --> 26:39.398
so we needed fast cash, and...

26:39.431 --> 26:42.401
wasn't fast enough.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.375
Hey, it's never too late,
you know?

26:49.408 --> 26:51.377
For what?

26:51.410 --> 26:52.879
To become a teacher.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.647
LANE :
Mitchell, it's Lane.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.182
Get your ass out here.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.753
Where's Mitchell?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.989
And think twice before
you tell me he's not here.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.691
Just a minute,
Mr. Lane.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.859
He's down
at the dock.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.696
I'm not someone to screw with,

27:09.729 --> 27:11.964
and they're about
to find that out.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.404
You realize I just signed
my own death warrant, right?

27:18.437 --> 27:19.806
We can protect you.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.407
You saw these guys.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.843
You're playing with fire.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.179
Look, don't worry
about Torres.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.815
He can handle himself.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.283
Okay, what do you got?
BISHOP: A name.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.853
She gave up the ringleader.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.688
McGEE: Look familiar?
GIBBS:
The yacht guy.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.323
His name is Richard Lane,
but we knew that.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.458
He makes his living
renting out boats at the marina.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.828
But we didn't know this.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.229
McGEE: He's got an
offshore account

27:43.262 --> 27:44.864
in the Caymans.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.699
Lane is making a lot
of cash somehow,

27:46.733 --> 27:48.701
and it's not from booze cruises.
We got our guy, boss.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.370
All right. BOLO.
BISHOP: Uh, don't need one.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.072
Torres just texted.
Lane's at the marina.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.473
It looks like something's
about to go down.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.709
All right, grab your gear.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.947
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.819
GIBBS: Any word from Torres?
BISHOP: Uh, no.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.922
He's gone dark. His last
text was 20 minutes ago.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.829
GIBBS:
All right.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.332
Bishop, cover the front.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.302
What Hey,
what about McGee?

28:23.335 --> 28:24.904
Okay, covering
the front.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.907
Where'd they go?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.441
Not the question.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.246
What happened?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.182
That's the question.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.354
That's Torres's burn phone.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.392
NCIS. Don't move.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.928
Uh...

28:48.961 --> 28:50.529
can I help you?

28:50.562 --> 28:51.964
Whose blood is this?

28:51.998 --> 28:54.400
What blood?
I don't see any blood.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.137
BISHOP:
Yeah.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.406
Me, neither. Drop 'em!

29:14.186 --> 29:16.222
Don't know how the Feds
caught on to us, boss,

29:16.255 --> 29:18.157
but the new girl
just saved my ass.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.992
Okay, good.
What's the play?

29:20.026 --> 29:22.261
GIBBS : Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

29:22.294 --> 29:24.263
No, but it
feels right.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.566
Let me know when
you get there.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.202
Boss wants us
to take these guys off base,

29:30.236 --> 29:32.905
waste 'em, then bury
all three bodies at once.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.842
Who's the third? And where
the hell is my boyfriend?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.910
Watch them.
I'll be right back.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.284
Talk to me.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.219
Uh, I don't know
what happened here,

29:47.253 --> 29:50.156
but Torres could be in trouble,
and if we want to find him,

29:50.189 --> 29:52.024
this is the only way.
Boss, I think

29:52.058 --> 29:53.325
maybe he's been
a bad influence on her.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.261
BISHOP:
Just trust me.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.163
This guy will never, ever
tell us what went down.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.199
Bishop, I trust you.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.168
And if anyone
in his crew finds out

30:02.201 --> 30:05.872
that I'm a federal agent,
they'll kill Torres on the spot.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.374
DONNIE : I can't
believe Lane shot me!

30:08.407 --> 30:10.242
I'm really
rethinking that decision

30:10.276 --> 30:12.144
not to be a fireman
right now.

30:12.178 --> 30:15.114
Donnie, we've got to get
you to the hospital.
Ah, nah.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.583
No hospitals.
There's too many questions.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.185
Well, here's a question.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.853
How long
until you bleed to death?

30:20.887 --> 30:24.590
Ah, I think
that bleeding's almost stopped.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.059
It's too late
for my suede seats, though.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.261
All right, no hospital.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.463
But we got to get you
off the streets, buddy.
We got a safe house

30:31.497 --> 30:33.165
set up outside of Baltimore.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.466
You turn around,
we can go there.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.368
Oh, yeah, if you want
to get killed, sure.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.970
After what happened
back there, man,

30:38.004 --> 30:40.406
you're out of business
for a while.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.008
Right now, there's
a feeding frenzy

30:42.041 --> 30:43.275
between all your
rival drug dealers.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.011
We can't trust
the safe house.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.147
Okay. So what do we do?

30:54.286 --> 30:56.255
What the hell are you doing?

30:56.288 --> 31:00.226
I wanted to be a fireman
when I was a kid, too.

31:00.259 --> 31:03.195
And, um,
50 million other things.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.264
And, at the end, I...

31:07.166 --> 31:10.136
I guess I did 'em all.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.312
Donnie, I have something
to tell you.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.186
Let's go.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.155
No. I-I'm not
going anywhere

31:29.188 --> 31:31.190
until you tell me
where my boyfriend is.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.093
He's fine.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.061
That's not what I asked.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.529
Tell her the truth.
Your boyfriend's dead.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.699
Ignore them.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.634
They're just trying to drive
a wedge between us.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.470
Your boyfriend is fine.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.238
But Donnie took a hit.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.640
They're en route to
a Baltimore safe house.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.741
You gonna tell me
what happened or what?

31:49.775 --> 31:52.278
We had a problem with someone
in our supply chain.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.213
Guy came in with a
little too much attitude.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.314
So you killed him.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.348
Lane killed himself

31:56.382 --> 31:58.050
the moment he pulled
a gun on me.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.953
Richard Lane?
Oh, you know him?

32:04.190 --> 32:05.491
Condolences.

32:08.394 --> 32:12.331
Are you making a play to
take over the business?

32:12.364 --> 32:13.632
Take over...?

32:13.665 --> 32:17.369
Hold up.
You think this tool

32:17.403 --> 32:20.172
is the boss?

32:20.206 --> 32:23.075
I hope you guys haven't been
working this case for too long,

32:23.109 --> 32:24.210
because you're nowhere.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.744
Th

32:25.777 --> 32:27.679
No.

32:27.713 --> 32:31.583
All he did was rent us the boats
we used to pick up our product.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.285
We send these out empty...

32:36.355 --> 32:39.258
...they come back filled
with pure-grade fentanyl.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.761
Top-of-the-line product,
almost too good to be true.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.197
It was like printing money.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.598
Looks like you're gonna
have to find a new way

32:46.632 --> 32:48.267
to smuggle the drugs.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.741
If Lane's not the boss, who is?

32:55.774 --> 32:59.745
Wait. So if she's not
your girlfriend...

32:59.778 --> 33:01.280
then who is she?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.615
We're federal agents.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.386
Federal agents?

33:07.419 --> 33:10.256
My name is not Luis.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.424
I'm Special Agent Nick Torres
from NCIS.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.595
You lied to me.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.630
And I'm sorry about that.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.702
Look, man, I think
you're a good guy...

33:23.735 --> 33:26.338
who got caught up
in a bad situation.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.273
Ah, gee, thanks.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.341
You think you could
tell that to the judge?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.210
You're not the one we want.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.347
If you're willing to testify
against your boss,

33:35.381 --> 33:38.217
we can protect you.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.019
Well, Nick...

33:42.688 --> 33:45.224
I don't think I can do that.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.259
Huh.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.302
I am the boss.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.271
Now start driving.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.607
Now.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.076
REEVES: Still no lead
on the Baltimore safe house,

34:04.110 --> 34:06.378
but we did manage to pull
Donnie's vehicle registration.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.080
Green Jeep Cherokee.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.281
BOLO.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.217
Already out. And the
staties just reported

34:11.250 --> 34:12.718
a sighting
outside Wilton.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.086
Then they lost him.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.621
Wilton?
Where the hell is that?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.656
It's got to be closer to
Baltimore than we are.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.591
Nick's gonna be okay, right?

34:21.327 --> 34:23.162
Thanks for playing.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.330
Try again next time.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.371
Not talking?

34:32.404 --> 34:34.706
Bishop was right.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.209
He does know where the
safe house is in Baltimore,

34:37.243 --> 34:38.544
but he's locked up
tight as a drum.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.347
Let's unlock him.
Not gonna happen.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.283
This guy would rather go to
prison than rat out his crew.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.152
Jack, thanks.
I'll take it from here.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.419
Okay.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.124
Jack.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.326
Why don't you go back upstairs?
I got this.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.662
I got it from here.

35:12.478 --> 35:16.782
So... sending in
the big guns now, huh?

35:20.319 --> 35:22.354
I got to admit,

35:22.388 --> 35:24.656
I didn't see
this one coming.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.193
Well, that makes two of us.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.196
Though, in hindsight,
it kind of makes sense.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.464
Your "girlfriend" was
way out of your league.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.200
She's, like, a hard ten.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.435
You're, like,
a soft seven.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.670
Oh, she'll love to hear that.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.773
Slow down.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.310
I don't want to get pulled over
on our way to the safe house.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.777
And when we get
to the safe house?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.347
Tell me everything NCIS knows
about my business.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.782
You're not very good at
reading people, are you?

35:50.816 --> 35:54.786
I don't know how you ended up
on that side of the line,

35:54.820 --> 35:58.590
but I don't think
your heart's in it.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.959
Yeah, you're too good at this.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.462
Maybe I'm just that awesome.
Maybe.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.198
I don't think you are.

36:06.232 --> 36:10.202
I mean, the way you
looked at your partner

36:10.236 --> 36:12.971
after that kiss...

36:13.004 --> 36:17.676
Any man that can fake that
deserves to win an Oscar.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.812
That desk is killing you.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.449
Only time you
really feel alive is when

36:23.482 --> 36:24.716
you're back
on the street.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.719
So come with me.
Join our crew.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.456
You don't have to go back
to that desk.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.292
I'm afraid I do.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.561
I left a candle burning.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.499
MITCHELL: Only thing
I'm gonna tell you is:

36:40.532 --> 36:42.501
your agent's dead.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.837
Or he will be by the time they
get to that safe house.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.474
Trust me, Donnie's
made him by now.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.611
You trying to scare me?

36:52.644 --> 36:54.813
You're gonna have to try harder
than that.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.452
:
Okay.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.724
:
Oh, okay.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.300
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to join my crew.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.936
Stay at NCIS, be our man
on the inside.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.406
You just can't quit me, huh?

37:20.439 --> 37:22.508
:
Nah, I'm a businessman.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.576
And I think you'd make
a great investment.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.044
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.514
That's funny, 'cause I-I
thought I was a seven.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.517
Soft seven.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.419
Ah, life taught me
a long time ago, when you see

37:33.452 --> 37:36.288
an opportunity, you better
be ready to jump on it.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.491
We both know that you're
just stringing me along

37:39.525 --> 37:42.428
to find out how much
NCIS has on you.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.333
And then you're gonna put
a bullet in my head.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.369
Not me.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.803
But my crew.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.042
All right, we're here.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.744
Okay, slow down.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.979
Then we're gonna
park in the back.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.382
Slow down.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.355
Slow down!
What are you doing?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.022
Hey! Stop the car!

38:11.056 --> 38:12.290
Stop the car!

38:24.069 --> 38:26.872
Son of a bitch.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.876
:
Sorry. I saw an opportunity.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.613
So I jumped on it.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.690
It doesn't matter.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.492
You're a dead man.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.093
I got three guys inside.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.961
: What do you think
they're doing right now?

39:05.477 --> 39:08.079
Hey, Torres!

39:08.113 --> 39:09.548
That was some
good driving.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.584
Gibbs!

39:12.618 --> 39:14.553
Yes!

39:14.586 --> 39:16.021
McGEE: Mitchell gave up
the safe house.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.389
Glad you could make it.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.424
McGee.

39:19.625 --> 39:22.360
Ah. Yes!

39:24.463 --> 39:26.898
Gibbs, I got to give you a kiss.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.033
I'm gonna kiss you.
Come here.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.607
Donnie started as
a low-level dealer,

39:35.641 --> 39:37.676
selling to mostly civilians.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.112
But then had the idea
to use the Norfolk marina

39:41.146 --> 39:42.881
to smuggle drugs onto the base.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.750
And nobody knew that
Donnie was the leader?

39:44.783 --> 39:45.951
GIBBS:
Almost nobody.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.719
BISHOP:
Only his top lieutenants.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.120
That's how I'd do it.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.725
Not that I...

39:53.759 --> 39:55.627
ever would.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.430
Well, glad to hear that there's
a limit to your insubordination.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.767
Speaking of which,
there's about 50 scuba tanks

40:01.800 --> 40:03.769
that need to be carried out
of the evidence truck.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.837
Yeah, figured you could
handle it, muscles.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.607
VANCE: And as for you,
Agent Bishop,

40:08.640 --> 40:10.208
hell of a job.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.143
Hungry?

40:12.177 --> 40:14.045
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I could eat.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.014
:
Unbelievable.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.584
I-I bring down an
entire drug ring

40:18.617 --> 40:21.920
and all I get is a promotion
to Special Agent Gopher.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.989
Hmm. Oh,

40:24.022 --> 40:26.157
that you brought down?
I mean, I seem to recall

40:26.191 --> 40:27.859
rescuing you at the end there.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.160
Do you not remember me

40:29.194 --> 40:31.697
launching the bad guy
into orbit?

40:33.131 --> 40:34.600
All right,
all right.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.168
You were good.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.937
Really good.

40:38.970 --> 40:42.140
Well, I had a good teacher.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.610
Well, you taught me
some things, too.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.678
Really

40:46.712 --> 40:48.246
Like don't eat garlic pasta

40:48.279 --> 40:50.115
before you make out
with your partner.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.918
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but that was a little rough.

40:52.951 --> 40:56.154
I wasn't gonna say anything
but you got a little toothy.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.523
Ah. Rude.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.126
We got weird jobs.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.062
Weird... but awesome.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.600
I'm kind of sad it's over.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.702
I mean, what am I gonna do now?

41:10.736 --> 41:12.671
Go home?
Watch a movie?

41:12.704 --> 41:14.940
Oof, boring.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.709
No. Let's-let's
do something.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.211
Like, hit the gun range,

41:20.245 --> 41:22.914
or go BASE jumping.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.150
Can't. Scuba tanks.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.618
Oh, right.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.120
Good luck with that.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.157
See ya tomorrow.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.759
Luis.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.727
See you later, Charlie.
