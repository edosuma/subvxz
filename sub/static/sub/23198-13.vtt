02:11.945 --> 02:15.847
- Good? Exciting, realistic.
- Extremely.

02:16.183 --> 02:19.118
That's exactly how we're gonna treat
this new movie:

02:19.186 --> 02:22.519
Maximum realism,
top-drawer production value.

02:22.923 --> 02:26.120
- It'll be a smash, Mr. Bremer.
- Thank you.

02:26.827 --> 02:30.126
And all the box-office receipts
go to buy war bonds.

02:30.330 --> 02:32.059
So, General? Major?

02:33.400 --> 02:34.765
What do you say?

02:34.835 --> 02:38.999
I have to admit, I had my doubts
when you first suggested this project...

02:40.240 --> 02:42.970
- but you've won me over completely.
- And me.

02:43.043 --> 02:46.877
Me, too. Just think, Hollywood.

02:47.347 --> 02:48.712
Then it's a go.

02:48.782 --> 02:52.013
As far as the War Department
is concerned, it's a go.

02:52.085 --> 02:53.245
All right.

02:53.654 --> 02:57.215
A movie like you're going to make
will be an enormous morale booster.

02:57.291 --> 03:01.694
Four top American heroes recreating
their acts of bravery on the screen.

03:02.062 --> 03:05.793
You know, we're still hoping, Major,
that your personal story...

03:05.866 --> 03:07.800
is gonna be part of the movie.

03:07.868 --> 03:11.201
- That's up to the General.
- But he's got to be in the movie, General.

03:11.271 --> 03:14.832
Steve bringing that flaming plane in
and saving his crew.

03:15.108 --> 03:18.544
- That'll be something to see.
- You're absolutely right, Yeoman Prince.

03:18.612 --> 03:20.944
How soon do you need the Major
in Hollywood?

03:21.014 --> 03:23.175
As soon as possible.
Can you leave tomorrow?

03:23.250 --> 03:25.013
- Well...
- He sure can.

03:26.386 --> 03:28.286
Can you be ready to go, Diana?

03:28.822 --> 03:31.882
- But do you need me in Hollywood?
- I like that.

03:32.059 --> 03:34.619
Every beautiful young woman
in these United States...

03:34.695 --> 03:36.856
would give her right arm
to go to Hollywood.

03:36.963 --> 03:38.931
And you ask if you're needed there.

03:38.999 --> 03:41.797
I don't understand
what's so special about Hollywood.

03:41.868 --> 03:44.530
It's just a small suburb
in Los Angeles, isn't it?

03:44.604 --> 03:47.664
- Diana, sometimes I don't understand you.
- Why?

03:47.808 --> 03:51.539
Hollywood, Clark Gable, Cary Grant...

03:51.845 --> 03:55.906
Tyrone Power. Paradise, USA.

03:56.016 --> 03:58.211
- Paradise?
- Absolutely.

03:59.553 --> 04:02.351
In that case, how can I refuse? I mean...

04:02.422 --> 04:05.482
I feel in need of a trip
to paradise about now.

04:11.598 --> 04:14.761
And the festival will run a full three days.

04:15.369 --> 04:17.997
Now we'll need a queen of the festival...

04:19.072 --> 04:23.634
bearing in mind that I cannot fulfill
that function under our constitution.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.240
It should be Diana, of course.

04:26.646 --> 04:29.843
Daughter, I only wish it could be so.
It would be fitting.

04:29.916 --> 04:34.319
Mother, this is the 2,000th anniversary
of our arrival on Paradise Island.

04:34.388 --> 04:38.188
It's the bimillenial celebration
of the most important day in our history.

04:38.258 --> 04:41.455
Diana is heir to the throne.
Diana has to be here.

04:41.528 --> 04:44.326
I agree with you. She should be here.

04:45.499 --> 04:48.195
Then I guess someone
will just have to go to America...

04:48.268 --> 04:50.236
and bring her home for the festival.

04:50.303 --> 04:53.830
Did you have anyone special in mind
for that assignment?

04:54.574 --> 04:57.042
Not really,
except that it should be someone...

04:57.110 --> 05:01.274
who has been to America already,
and someone who is very close to Diana.

05:01.348 --> 05:04.408
- Now where could I find such a person?
- Mother.

05:05.385 --> 05:08.718
- Very well, Drusilla. Go fetch your sister.
- Thank you, Mother.

05:08.789 --> 05:12.748
Remember she said she was staying
in a place called Hollywood.

05:13.293 --> 05:17.127
Drusilla, just give her the message
and then come right back home.

05:17.197 --> 05:20.963
I don't want both my daughters
in America in such perilous times.

05:25.305 --> 05:28.206
It just occurred to me,
the last time you were in America...

05:28.275 --> 05:30.436
I'll tell Diana, and thanks, Mom.

05:32.546 --> 05:35.310
Oh, dear, I do hope
I'm not making a mistake.

05:36.716 --> 05:37.774
Mom?

06:33.807 --> 06:35.900
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Bremer.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.945
- This is really fantastic.
- Terrific, isn't it?

06:39.012 --> 06:41.879
First day of production,
we're an hour behind schedule.

06:41.948 --> 06:43.176
Excuse me.

06:43.717 --> 06:47.619
All right, come on. Let's get moving.
Let's get this show on the road.

06:47.687 --> 06:51.817
All right, what are we waiting for?
Let's get going. Okay, then, roll it.

06:52.359 --> 06:54.384
All right. Give me the special effects.

06:54.461 --> 06:59.125
All right, now. Start the wind. Come on,
more wind. Give me a bigger wind.

06:59.299 --> 07:01.199
All right. That's good.

07:02.536 --> 07:05.699
Now, then. Ready? Action.

07:07.207 --> 07:10.870
Hit the silk, Bill.
That's an order, Lieutenant.

07:12.212 --> 07:13.873
I'm taking her in alone.

07:41.808 --> 07:45.244
Cut it! What's going on with the key light?

07:55.655 --> 07:57.247
Come on, fellas.

07:57.357 --> 08:00.520
Yeoman Prince, would you kindly not lean
against the light?

08:00.927 --> 08:02.724
All right, once more.

08:05.198 --> 08:08.258
Just stay where you are, Steve,
we got to do it again.

08:10.136 --> 08:12.127
Sweat him up, will you, please?

08:53.346 --> 08:55.246
Man, oh, man. I got it.

08:55.415 --> 08:57.406
- You got what?
- Her autograph.

08:57.784 --> 09:01.117
- Who's she?
- Who's she? She's a star!

09:01.287 --> 09:05.018
Go on, I know where the stars exist.
They're in the heavens.

09:06.026 --> 09:08.551
- You're weird.
- I'm weird?

09:09.129 --> 09:12.064
Sure you are.
Like, what kind of a getup is that?

09:12.132 --> 09:13.121
Getup?

09:13.199 --> 09:16.930
The clothes, dummy, the clothes.
Unless...

09:17.637 --> 09:19.298
Hey, you're in pictures.

09:19.372 --> 09:22.773
Yeah, lots of them.
My mother has a book...

09:22.842 --> 09:25.970
I knew it! I knew it.
You were trying to put me on.

09:26.179 --> 09:27.942
Can I have your autograph?

09:28.014 --> 09:30.414
You there, miss. They'll be waiting for you.

09:30.483 --> 09:31.609
They will?

09:31.685 --> 09:34.279
Certainly. You're in
The Fall of the Greek Empire, right?

09:35.288 --> 09:38.519
Follow on through this door.
Go through Western Street...

09:38.591 --> 09:41.219
I'm certainly looking forward
to working with you.

09:41.294 --> 09:43.353
- Thank you.
- Welcome aboard.

09:45.498 --> 09:46.658
Diana.

09:46.733 --> 09:48.758
This is Cpl. Jim Ames.

09:48.835 --> 09:51.065
Jim, this is Yeoman Diana Prince.

09:51.137 --> 09:53.071
Nice to meet you. I've heard about you.

09:53.139 --> 09:56.165
You're one of the war heroes
who'll be in Mr. Bremer's film.

09:56.242 --> 09:57.368
Yes, ma'am.

09:57.444 --> 09:59.844
Jim is another future star of mine.

10:00.580 --> 10:01.672
Come here.

10:04.117 --> 10:05.709
Here you are. Your very own chair.

10:05.785 --> 10:07.047
That's terrific.

10:08.021 --> 10:10.387
Go on, sit down. Enjoy yourself.

10:12.926 --> 10:16.623
I still don't know if I'm gonna be able
to act in front of the camera.

10:16.696 --> 10:20.132
Sure you will. Just be yourself.

10:21.634 --> 10:23.829
See you later. Hey, Michael!

10:24.704 --> 10:26.831
Jim, come on. Sit down, relax.

10:31.211 --> 10:33.975
I sure hope he knows
what he's talking about.

10:34.047 --> 10:35.446
I'm sure he does.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.676
I've never been so scared in all my life.

10:37.751 --> 10:39.048
You'll be fine.

10:39.119 --> 10:41.679
Diana. Can you come here
a minute, please?

10:41.755 --> 10:45.350
Sure. Excuse me.
You'll be great. I promise.

10:49.162 --> 10:50.151
Yes, sir.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.790
I'm stuck up here in the sky.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.864
Can you get us
a couple of cups of coffee, black, please?

10:56.936 --> 10:59.268
Sure. There's some
just out back of the stage.

10:59.339 --> 11:01.534
- It'll take a few minutes.
- Thank you.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.090
Cpl. Ames!

11:21.060 --> 11:22.584
Hello again, Diana.

11:32.438 --> 11:33.700
Dru!

11:44.717 --> 11:47.083
You stay here. I'll handle this.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.406
Drusilla, look out!

12:19.419 --> 12:20.943
You're all right.

12:28.027 --> 12:29.756
I'll be right back.

12:31.164 --> 12:32.825
Are you all right?

12:34.133 --> 12:35.361
What happened?

12:35.435 --> 12:38.233
I think someone was trying to kidnap you.

12:38.872 --> 12:40.237
I thought that...

12:40.306 --> 12:41.773
Wonder Woman.

12:44.377 --> 12:47.141
- Boy, do I feel woozy.
- Here, let me help you up.

12:49.883 --> 12:51.407
Oh, excuse me.

12:51.651 --> 12:55.553
Cpl. Ames, this is my little sister,
Drusilla. Drusilla, Jim Ames.

12:55.622 --> 12:56.816
Hello.

12:58.791 --> 13:01.419
Too many things are all happening
at once.

13:01.694 --> 13:05.061
Do you have any idea who those men were
or what they wanted?

13:05.131 --> 13:06.758
Not the foggiest.

13:11.137 --> 13:13.367
I think I'd better go sit down.

13:14.173 --> 13:17.267
- I'm not feeling too well.
- I can understand. Are you all right?

13:17.343 --> 13:18.571
Oh, yeah.

13:20.546 --> 13:22.946
Drusilla, what are you doing here?

13:23.016 --> 13:25.484
You know, the bimillenial celebration.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.610
Mother sent me to make sure
that you'll come.

13:27.687 --> 13:29.450
Yes, of course. I haven't forgotten.

13:29.522 --> 13:32.491
You can tell Mother
that I'll make every effort to be there.

13:32.558 --> 13:36.756
That won't satisfy her. You know Mother.
Diana, you have to be there.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.922
I'll try, Drusilla, I'll really try.

13:38.998 --> 13:42.991
It's just that I'm very concerned.
There are strange things going on here.

13:43.069 --> 13:45.196
You mean the attack
on that nice Jim Ames?

13:45.271 --> 13:47.330
Yes. You like him?

13:47.974 --> 13:50.204
Yeah, he's cute.

13:50.276 --> 13:54.178
Cute? You're in America for a few hours
and you're already using their slang.

13:54.247 --> 13:57.114
- Well, he is cute.
- Yes, he is.

13:57.984 --> 14:00.316
Is that what you're worried about?

14:00.386 --> 14:04.686
No, I'm concerned that someone might be
trying to sabotage this film project.

14:04.757 --> 14:06.782
- Who?
- I have no idea.

14:06.859 --> 14:10.761
A rival studio, maybe.
I've heard a lot of things about Hollywood.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.221
People call it a jungle.

14:13.299 --> 14:17.429
All I saw was half a dozen sad-looking
palm trees, hardly a jungle.

14:18.037 --> 14:19.800
Dru, it's not that kind of jungle.

14:19.872 --> 14:22.739
It's a jungle where businessmen
prey on each other.

14:22.809 --> 14:24.868
Never will understand men.

14:24.944 --> 14:28.436
Me, neither. But I'm certainly
learning more each day.

14:29.082 --> 14:30.106
Me, too.

14:30.183 --> 14:31.912
But the lesson's over for now.

14:31.985 --> 14:34.146
You have to return home
to Paradise Island.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.450
- I just got here.
- I know.

14:36.522 --> 14:40.822
I'm sure Mother told you to deliver me
the message and return immediately.

14:40.893 --> 14:44.260
Can't I just stay for the night?
Mom won't mind, really.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.862
I've really missed you,
and there is a party tonight.

14:49.936 --> 14:52.803
It'd be fun going together, don't you think?

14:52.872 --> 14:55.102
It's what they call a Hollywood party.

14:55.174 --> 14:57.699
But tomorrow you leave. Understood?

14:57.944 --> 14:59.070
Yeah.

14:59.479 --> 15:02.812
What do American women
wear to these Hollywood parties?

15:02.882 --> 15:05.942
Steve told me to wear something slinky.

15:06.019 --> 15:08.453
Slinky. What's "slinky"?

15:09.622 --> 15:12.921
I didn't tell him,
but I haven't the slightest idea.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.225
Excuse me.

15:20.199 --> 15:21.723
That's slinky?

15:22.268 --> 15:23.633
I think so.

15:24.203 --> 15:26.433
I don't think that would suit you.

15:26.506 --> 15:29.805
You don't? I don't know about that.
I think it's cute.

15:29.876 --> 15:34.074
Besides, look, Diana,
everyone's staring at her, even the men.

15:35.048 --> 15:36.982
I'm glad you boys finally got here.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.848
What have you been doing?
Looking for movie stars?

15:39.919 --> 15:41.716
You came to the right place.

15:41.788 --> 15:45.189
Here we are. My four hero stars together.

15:45.258 --> 15:46.919
You all know each other, I suppose.

15:46.993 --> 15:48.324
- Hello, Major.
- Hello, Sergeant.

15:48.394 --> 15:50.589
I don't think you know
my little sister, Drusilla.

15:50.663 --> 15:53.791
This is Sgt. Harry Willard.
This is Mark Bremer, the producer.

15:53.866 --> 15:57.267
And Lt. Bill Rand.
They're all doing the movie together.

15:57.336 --> 15:59.361
How are you, Drusilla? Welcome.

15:59.439 --> 16:03.170
I got to leave you nice people.
There are more greats arriving.

16:03.476 --> 16:06.843
We're expecting Louis B. And J.L.
A little later.

16:09.348 --> 16:12.112
Explain them to her, will you? Have fun.

16:13.886 --> 16:16.081
It's all right.
I don't know who they are, either.

16:16.322 --> 16:17.812
This is really something.

16:17.890 --> 16:21.087
Sure is. Just like
one of those fan mags, right, Major?

16:21.160 --> 16:24.323
Right, Sergeant.
What do you think of all this, Jim?

16:24.397 --> 16:27.161
I sort of feel out of place.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.199
Oh, no. You shouldn't. You're a war hero.

16:31.971 --> 16:33.563
Heck, I didn't do anything.

16:33.639 --> 16:35.903
You certainly did, soldier. Be proud of it.

16:35.975 --> 16:38.205
Hello, everyone. Super party.

16:38.911 --> 16:41.277
Has anyone taken care of the Navy?

16:41.347 --> 16:42.712
Not until now.

16:42.782 --> 16:45.615
Good. Come on then.
You can buy me a drink.

16:48.688 --> 16:52.055
Sergeant, you're going to let
the Navy get one up on you?

16:52.125 --> 16:53.353
No, sir.

16:55.495 --> 16:56.860
May I get you a drink?

16:58.397 --> 17:00.126
Sure, but nothing alcoholic.

17:00.199 --> 17:02.394
Just a little glass of champagne.
It'll relax you.

17:02.468 --> 17:03.867
- No, thank you.
- I'll take one.

17:03.936 --> 17:05.665
No, you won't. You're too young.

17:05.738 --> 17:08.400
We'll find something suitable. Come on.

17:08.473 --> 17:11.739
You, too, Jim. I want you
where I can keep an eye on you.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.540
At least until we discover
what that attack was about today.

17:14.614 --> 17:15.876
Yes, sir.

17:17.049 --> 17:18.346
No, thanks.

17:19.185 --> 17:22.244
I think it's absolutely marvelous
what you did.

17:23.055 --> 17:25.522
- I mean, so brave.
- Not really.

17:25.590 --> 17:28.719
To tell the truth,
I just acted out of instinct.

17:28.895 --> 17:32.058
But with all your men injured like that
you kept firing...

17:32.131 --> 17:34.099
and you sunk a Nazi battleship.

17:34.167 --> 17:35.532
Just a destroyer.

17:35.601 --> 17:38.365
Destroyer, battleship, it's all the same.
You sunk it.

17:38.437 --> 17:41.270
Did the President give you
that medal personally?

17:42.575 --> 17:44.440
- In the flesh.
- Tell me about it.

17:44.510 --> 17:47.138
I was called up to the White House,
and the President...

17:47.213 --> 17:49.681
Not here, there are too many people.

17:50.016 --> 17:53.008
Let's go somewhere else
where we can be alone.

18:12.238 --> 18:14.331
So, what did he say to you?

18:14.507 --> 18:16.805
First they read the citation.

18:16.876 --> 18:20.334
All very official.
A lot of whereases and wherefores.

18:20.413 --> 18:24.713
Then they handed the medal to
the President, and he presented it to me.

18:24.784 --> 18:26.046
He shook my hand.

18:26.118 --> 18:28.746
Said that America was proud
to have officers like me...

18:28.821 --> 18:31.255
Sailor. Don't make a sound.

18:32.024 --> 18:33.457
You're coming with us.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.981
- Where are you taking me?
- Get in the truck.

18:57.316 --> 18:59.648
All right, let's get out of here.

19:11.063 --> 19:12.052
Bye-bye.

19:12.131 --> 19:13.325
Mr. Bremer.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.592
Have you seen Lt. Rand?

19:15.668 --> 19:17.067
Not recently. Why?

19:17.169 --> 19:19.763
We're getting ready to leave.
I wanted to say good night.

19:19.839 --> 19:24.776
Listen, last time I saw him, he was getting
pretty thick with some little starlet.

19:25.011 --> 19:27.206
Maybe they slipped off early.

19:27.813 --> 19:29.371
What was her name?

19:29.448 --> 19:32.110
I don't know.
They all look the same to me.

19:32.184 --> 19:34.311
You're not worried, are you?

19:34.387 --> 19:35.581
Uneasy maybe.

19:35.655 --> 19:38.089
Don't worry.
He'll turn up at the studio tomorrow.

19:38.157 --> 19:40.318
He'd better, he's on early call.

19:40.726 --> 19:42.887
- Maybe you're right.
- Excuse me.

19:45.898 --> 19:49.061
- Did you find Lt. Rand?
- No, he left early.

19:49.135 --> 19:52.969
That's strange. Why would he
leave a nice party like this early?

19:53.039 --> 19:55.599
Maybe he had something important
on his mind.

19:55.675 --> 19:57.666
I think he did. Shall we?

19:58.244 --> 19:59.506
I hope he's all right.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.744
Mr. Bremer, thank you very much.
It was a lovely party.

20:03.816 --> 20:05.784
You're welcome. Glad you could all come.

20:05.851 --> 20:07.478
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

20:07.553 --> 20:09.214
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

20:09.288 --> 20:11.119
- Thanks for the party.
- You're welcome.

20:11.190 --> 20:14.523
Listen, I'm sorry
you didn't get to meet Louis B. Or J.L.

20:14.593 --> 20:17.221
- I didn't know they came.
- They didn't.

20:17.296 --> 20:19.161
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.467
Gloria!

20:31.143 --> 20:32.735
Is everyone gone?

20:32.812 --> 20:35.440
Yes, everyone's gone. You can come out.

20:39.585 --> 20:42.349
I assume that everything went all right.

20:42.588 --> 20:43.919
Perfectly.

20:45.291 --> 20:48.692
That's very good, my dear, well done.
To your health.

20:49.829 --> 20:51.228
Good night.

21:03.776 --> 21:07.974
Thanks. That's all for now.
You can finish it off in the morning.

21:21.660 --> 21:23.389
Where's the blonde?

21:24.597 --> 21:25.894
She's gone.

21:25.965 --> 21:27.830
What did you tell her?

21:28.567 --> 21:32.936
I did not have to tell her anything, Kurt.
I promised her a part in a picture.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.703
Is everything all right at your end?

21:38.778 --> 21:39.836
Perfect.

21:39.912 --> 21:43.473
That will be a change from
this morning's fiasco with Cpl. Ames.

21:43.549 --> 21:46.109
How were we to know
Wonder Woman was in Hollywood?

21:46.185 --> 21:48.210
We'll have to be
a lot more careful next time.

21:48.287 --> 21:51.279
Don't worry, I have other plans
for young Mr. Ames.

21:51.357 --> 21:55.225
What about the other two?
Maj. Trevor and Sgt. Willard?

21:55.294 --> 21:59.230
In three days, the four of them
will be on their way to Germany.

21:59.465 --> 22:02.957
Four American war heroes
to stand trial in Berlin...

22:03.202 --> 22:06.069
for war crimes against the German people.

22:06.572 --> 22:10.941
That, Kurt, is a great propaganda victory.

22:11.777 --> 22:14.211
The Party should be proud of you.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.181
They should. Getting them
all together, the four of them.

22:17.249 --> 22:21.618
With all of this publicity, and kidnapping
them in front of everybody's noses.

22:21.987 --> 22:23.579
- And then...
- And then?

22:23.656 --> 22:26.284
...when the war is over, and we've won...

22:26.358 --> 22:29.794
then I will control the entire
American film industry.

22:48.314 --> 22:51.715
We've checked everywhere.
Bill Rand has disappeared.

22:52.084 --> 22:54.052
What about the girl he left the party with?

22:54.119 --> 22:55.950
We don't know he did that for sure.

22:56.021 --> 22:59.855
She's our only lead.
I'd like to see a list of your party guests.

22:59.925 --> 23:02.325
I'll tell my secretary. Excuse me.

23:03.429 --> 23:06.455
How long is it gonna take us
to wrap up here...

23:06.532 --> 23:08.727
and set up for the Sgt. Willard sequence?

23:08.801 --> 23:10.029
About a half an hour.

23:10.102 --> 23:12.468
Do it. We've wasted
enough time here already.

23:12.538 --> 23:14.665
Okay, we're moving outside.

23:15.841 --> 23:19.140
All you sailor extras,
you have to become Nazi soldiers.

23:19.979 --> 23:21.344
What do you think?

23:21.413 --> 23:23.074
I don't know what to think.

23:23.148 --> 23:26.640
First that attack on Jim Ames,
then Bill Rand disappearing.

23:26.719 --> 23:29.916
One thing I do know, I'm gonna keep
a close eye on Harry Willard...

23:29.989 --> 23:31.217
and Jim from now on.

23:31.290 --> 23:34.191
Jim's with Dru. They went somewhere
to have a farewell soda.

23:34.493 --> 23:35.517
She's leaving?

23:35.594 --> 23:38.529
I'm afraid so.
She has to go home to Mother.

23:40.599 --> 23:43.159
You know, at least
she did have to go home.

23:43.235 --> 23:45.760
Maybe it's better
if she sticks around for a while.

23:45.838 --> 23:47.829
She can help us watch out for Jim.

23:47.907 --> 23:50.899
What good would a 15-year-old girl be
if there was any trouble?

23:50.976 --> 23:55.572
Maybe none. But one thing's for sure.
She'll know where he is all the time.

23:57.283 --> 24:00.810
I really like ice-cream sodas.
Could I have another one?

24:00.886 --> 24:02.877
You've had three already.

24:04.223 --> 24:06.384
I want the Victory Special.

24:06.458 --> 24:08.153
Hi, sweetie.

24:09.962 --> 24:12.192
Jim, the Victory Special?

24:13.165 --> 24:14.723
That's double size.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.994
I know.

24:16.569 --> 24:18.901
Boy, you have some appetite for a girl.

24:18.971 --> 24:20.165
Please?

24:21.607 --> 24:23.404
Okay, I'll get it.

24:23.475 --> 24:26.501
Thanks. I'll be back in a minute, okay?

24:28.781 --> 24:29.941
What's your name?

24:37.489 --> 24:41.448
Yeoman Diana Prince. She's with
Maj. Trevor on the Mark Bremer movie.

24:41.527 --> 24:43.791
I think they're still on Stage 25.

24:47.466 --> 24:49.400
Look at the soldier boy, will you?

24:49.468 --> 24:52.369
A Victory Special. Ain't he cute?

24:52.438 --> 24:55.339
Where did you get the pretty suit,
soldier boy?

24:55.574 --> 24:59.874
Freddy, you're dumb. Don't you know?
Uncle Sam gave him that suit.

24:59.945 --> 25:02.379
He gives them
to all his little soldier boys.

25:02.448 --> 25:03.915
Is that right?

25:04.216 --> 25:05.979
No wonder we ain't in the Army.

25:06.051 --> 25:08.679
Wouldn't be seen dead in a suit like that.

25:08.754 --> 25:09.846
Hi, Diana.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.446
Drusilla. Where are you?

25:11.523 --> 25:13.388
I'm at this real neat coffee shop.

25:13.459 --> 25:15.586
I'm just going to have
one more Victory Special.

25:15.661 --> 25:17.686
I promise I'll leave as soon as
I'm finished.

25:17.763 --> 25:19.025
You don't have to leave.

25:19.098 --> 25:20.156
I don't?

25:20.232 --> 25:22.257
No, I'll explain later. But...

25:23.569 --> 25:25.560
just keep an eye on Jim.

25:26.038 --> 25:28.563
You're afraid
something might happen to him.

25:28.641 --> 25:32.236
Dru, sometimes you're so perceptive,
you remind me of Mom.

25:32.311 --> 25:33.938
I'll see you at the studio later.

25:34.013 --> 25:35.002
Bye-bye.

25:36.649 --> 25:40.141
That's a cute little number
you're with there, soldier boy.

25:40.219 --> 25:42.187
You want to introduce us?

25:43.122 --> 25:46.956
Soldier boy, my friend
just asked you a question.

25:47.026 --> 25:49.824
- I'm sorry, we're busy.
- Hey, Georgie, the soldier boy's busy.

25:49.895 --> 25:52.659
You don't want to tell us her name?
Tell Freddy her name.

25:52.731 --> 25:53.891
Come on, tell Freddy.

25:53.966 --> 25:56.764
You can tell Freddy.
You don't like it, just tell her name.

26:01.874 --> 26:03.637
At ease, soldier.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.074
Excuse me.

26:07.079 --> 26:10.913
- Hey, look at the chick in the funny suit.
- Where's the costume party, cutie?

26:10.983 --> 26:13.543
I think you should leave him alone.
He's a war hero.

26:13.619 --> 26:17.578
Hang around. After we take care of him,
we'll take care of you.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.214
I'm warning you.

26:19.291 --> 26:21.259
I'm quaking in my boots.

26:43.682 --> 26:45.081
Excuse me.

27:00.365 --> 27:02.299
What happened in there?

27:03.035 --> 27:05.503
There was a fight. Didn't you see?

27:05.804 --> 27:07.999
No, I was in the powder room.

27:08.407 --> 27:09.874
You didn't see anything?

27:09.942 --> 27:12.638
Yes, I saw two men laying on the floor.

27:14.379 --> 27:17.314
They started picking on me.
I took care of them.

27:17.382 --> 27:18.542
You...

27:19.651 --> 27:22.552
Come on, we'd better get back
to the studio.

27:27.059 --> 27:29.653
Come on, a lot more dirt. A lot more.

27:29.728 --> 27:32.993
This is a war film, for crying out loud.
Come on, get him dirty.

27:34.032 --> 27:36.523
That's enough dirt.
Now sweat him up good.

27:36.602 --> 27:38.035
Lots of sweat.

27:38.670 --> 27:42.071
All right. Fine.
Now, where are my dead bodies?

27:42.541 --> 27:45.533
Fellows, will you please stay close
when we're trying to do this?

27:45.611 --> 27:48.671
It's very difficult. Take your places,
please. Take your guns.

27:48.747 --> 27:50.510
Come on, let's go.

27:50.582 --> 27:52.379
Let's have it very quiet.

27:52.451 --> 27:54.749
Nazis, get ready.

27:54.820 --> 27:57.482
All right. Are you ready?

27:57.990 --> 28:01.187
Fine. Now ready on the smoke
and the flames.

28:01.426 --> 28:03.053
Diana, I need to talk to you.

28:03.128 --> 28:04.652
Is it important?

28:04.730 --> 28:06.425
I think it may be.

28:06.932 --> 28:08.900
Just as soon as he finishes this shot.

28:08.967 --> 28:10.366
Action!

28:37.229 --> 28:39.197
Cut!

28:39.498 --> 28:42.399
Look what happened to the grenade.
It didn't go off.

28:42.467 --> 28:45.834
All right. We'll have to do it again.
Sgt. Willard.

28:47.406 --> 28:50.842
Sgt. Willard, come on back.
We have to do it again.

28:58.283 --> 29:00.410
Sgt. Willard, can you hear me?

29:08.827 --> 29:11.455
- Where is he? Where's Willard?
- I don't know.

29:11.530 --> 29:14.363
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- He's disappeared.

29:19.371 --> 29:20.895
Well, keep looking.

29:23.609 --> 29:25.941
Willard is still among the missing.

29:26.011 --> 29:29.447
How can I make a movie when all my stars
are disappearing one by one?

29:29.514 --> 29:31.482
Did you have all the studio gates checked?

29:31.550 --> 29:34.451
Sure, but there's too much traffic
passing in and out.

29:34.519 --> 29:36.316
Can't pin anything down.

29:36.388 --> 29:39.482
He could have been taken out
in a prop van...

29:39.558 --> 29:41.583
a laundry truck, anything.

29:41.660 --> 29:44.788
Whoever did it was obviously waiting
behind that headquarter set...

29:44.863 --> 29:47.696
and had to be acquainted
with the workings of a movie studio.

29:47.766 --> 29:51.634
Major, there are 5,000 people
on the payroll here.

29:51.970 --> 29:55.701
And they are all acquainted
with the workings of a movie set.

29:56.475 --> 29:58.238
I'll get the phone.

30:02.581 --> 30:05.311
No, there's no more shooting today.
It's a wrap.

30:07.452 --> 30:09.750
Excuse me for one second, Steve.

30:11.423 --> 30:12.720
Yes, Dru.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.952
I wanted to talk to you about Jim.

30:16.128 --> 30:18.892
I don't think he's very much
of a war hero at all.

30:18.964 --> 30:20.591
What do you mean?

30:20.666 --> 30:22.725
He's not very heroic.

30:23.302 --> 30:24.826
He lied to me.

30:28.907 --> 30:32.604
Sometimes that has something to do
with a thing called ego.

30:32.744 --> 30:34.644
What did he lie about?

30:34.713 --> 30:37.079
- Excuse me, Diana.
- Yes, sir.

30:37.149 --> 30:40.380
I'm sorry to interrupt, Drusilla,
but Diana and I have work to do.

30:40.919 --> 30:42.181
Yes, sir, right away.

30:42.254 --> 30:45.155
Find out everything you can
about what we were discussing.

30:45.223 --> 30:47.487
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Sure. Right.

30:50.095 --> 30:52.825
Maj. Trevor wants me to stick close by.

30:53.165 --> 30:55.929
He thinks maybe I could be the next one.

30:56.001 --> 30:58.299
I'll stay with you if you like.

30:58.570 --> 31:00.094
I'd like that.

31:00.405 --> 31:04.034
Do you think he'd mind
if we went for a walk or something?

31:04.109 --> 31:07.135
I don't think he'd mind,
if we stay inside the studio.

31:07.212 --> 31:08.611
So, come on.

31:10.916 --> 31:13.646
Get a hold of the local
military-intelligence officer...

31:13.719 --> 31:15.949
have them run a check
on that list of party guests.

31:16.021 --> 31:17.579
We've got to find that girl.

31:17.656 --> 31:21.422
Try to get a list of all who knew anything
about today's shooting schedule...

31:21.493 --> 31:23.290
as far as it affected Sgt. Willard.

31:23.362 --> 31:25.990
And make sure none of this leaks out
to the press.

31:26.064 --> 31:27.292
Absolutely not, sir.

31:27.366 --> 31:30.961
We've got to find out
where those two men are being held.

31:42.581 --> 31:46.017
There you are, gentlemen.
You are comfortable, I trust.

31:46.385 --> 31:47.852
Where are we?

31:47.919 --> 31:50.752
You are on the D-704
somewhere in Pacific.

31:51.923 --> 31:53.618
We'll remain on station here...

31:53.692 --> 31:56.456
until your two companions
are prevailed upon to join us.

31:56.795 --> 32:00.754
Then we'll proceed around Cape Horn
and set course for Bremen.

32:00.832 --> 32:04.233
If you think you'll get your hands
on Steve Trevor, you're mistaken.

32:04.302 --> 32:06.429
I guarantee you 24 hours from now...

32:06.505 --> 32:09.997
Cpl. Ames and Maj. Trevor will be aboard.

32:11.043 --> 32:12.510
Take them away.

32:25.757 --> 32:28.521
- Any problems, Kurt?
- Worked like a dream.

32:28.593 --> 32:30.720
He came through that door
expecting to find...

32:30.796 --> 32:33.026
two actors dressed as Nazi officers...

32:33.398 --> 32:35.696
instead he found us.

32:36.401 --> 32:37.698
Very good.

32:39.237 --> 32:41.865
Maj. Trevor is creating pressures for us.

32:42.274 --> 32:45.038
He has called the local office
of military intelligence...

32:45.110 --> 32:46.873
and next will be the FBI.

32:46.945 --> 32:50.039
So we're going to have to move quicker
than we'd planned.

32:50.115 --> 32:51.412
What do you want to do?

32:51.483 --> 32:53.508
I want to take them both
at the same time...

32:53.585 --> 32:55.485
Maj. Trevor and Cpl. Ames.

32:55.554 --> 32:57.749
You'll wait for instructions.

32:59.391 --> 33:00.756
That's all.

33:14.439 --> 33:17.738
I really like hot dogs.
They're even better than ice cream.

33:17.809 --> 33:20.141
Could I have some more mustard?

33:26.685 --> 33:29.119
I like you, Dru. I like you a lot.

33:30.856 --> 33:33.620
That's why I'm gonna tell you what I am.

33:35.660 --> 33:39.096
What I did. What I got my medal for.

33:40.232 --> 33:41.961
There was a mistake.

33:42.567 --> 33:44.125
How can that be?

33:44.202 --> 33:45.897
I'll tell you how.

33:46.638 --> 33:51.166
The citation reads that
I captured a dozen Nazis single-handed.

33:51.576 --> 33:54.067
The truth is I got cut off from my unit.

33:54.146 --> 33:55.704
I was all alone.

33:55.780 --> 33:59.045
I saw a group of Nazis
and I thought I'd give myself up.

33:59.117 --> 34:02.280
Spend the rest of the war
in a nice, safe prison camp.

34:02.354 --> 34:05.881
What I didn't know was
that they were as afraid as I was.

34:06.625 --> 34:09.059
As soon as I appeared
they threw their guns down.

34:09.127 --> 34:11.618
Seemed like they had the same idea.

34:13.998 --> 34:15.899
I had to take them in.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.494
I couldn't do nothing else.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.606
Another thing.

34:23.507 --> 34:25.737
That fight here this morning.

34:27.145 --> 34:29.978
It wasn't me
who took on those two fellows.

34:32.516 --> 34:35.815
I was as scared then
as I was with the Nazis.

34:39.424 --> 34:41.949
I guess I'm just scared all the time.

34:42.027 --> 34:45.485
I think you're really brave
for telling me all of that.

34:50.835 --> 34:52.735
Telephone for Cpl. Ames.

34:53.271 --> 34:54.636
Excuse me.

34:58.176 --> 34:59.507
Cpl. Ames.

35:05.116 --> 35:06.208
Yes.

35:12.624 --> 35:13.955
Anything wrong?

35:14.025 --> 35:17.654
No. Look, I got to go back to my hotel.
I'll see you later.

35:24.936 --> 35:27.837
It doesn't usually go this slow.

35:27.906 --> 35:30.101
We should have been shooting
a half an hour ago.

35:30.175 --> 35:31.904
I don't know what's the matter.

35:41.886 --> 35:43.513
What's holding us up?

35:43.588 --> 35:46.284
Our star, Cpl. Ames, hasn't arrived yet.

35:46.358 --> 35:47.552
Where is he?

35:47.626 --> 35:50.595
I don't know. He said he was going
to pick up Maj. Trevor.

35:50.662 --> 35:52.289
They should be here by now.

35:52.364 --> 35:53.558
Terrific.

35:55.033 --> 35:56.660
Sure you have the right directions?

35:56.735 --> 35:58.396
This is where they told me, Major.

35:58.470 --> 36:01.132
Wait a minute, I'll ask these guys up here.

36:05.777 --> 36:07.244
Hey, you guys.

36:07.312 --> 36:09.337
You seen a movie company around here?

36:09.414 --> 36:10.904
Movie company?

36:12.417 --> 36:14.908
Let's see now.
I think that there might be...

36:14.986 --> 36:18.615
All right. Both of you.
Get out of the car. Into the other car.

36:23.228 --> 36:24.820
Put it down, Major.

36:31.102 --> 36:32.433
I'm sorry.

36:34.773 --> 36:37.674
Well, we can't do anything without them.
Move them back.

36:37.742 --> 36:39.801
All right. It's a wrap for today.

36:39.878 --> 36:41.709
Everybody back to the studio.

36:41.780 --> 36:44.408
They found the car. It's been abandoned.

36:44.482 --> 36:46.507
- Steve?
- And Jim?

36:46.584 --> 36:48.848
Both disappeared.
No sign of either of them.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.320
Disappeared?
What are you going to do about it?

36:51.389 --> 36:54.483
Don't worry.
We're alerting the authorities now.

36:54.759 --> 36:57.057
Thank you very much, Mr. Bremer.

36:57.862 --> 36:59.955
Come on, Dru. I have an idea.

37:11.376 --> 37:14.106
Well, soldier. How did they get to you?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.045
I'm sorry, Major.

37:17.115 --> 37:19.606
We'll see about that
once we get out of here.

37:23.621 --> 37:25.384
There they are, Mr. Bremer.

37:25.457 --> 37:27.186
Thank you, Captain.

37:29.094 --> 37:32.188
Gentlemen, welcome aboard. Major.

37:33.798 --> 37:37.165
Not a bad production, Bremer.
You set it all up very smoothly.

37:37.235 --> 37:40.727
Got the whole project going,
gathered your four victims together...

37:40.805 --> 37:42.796
you knew our every movement.

37:42.874 --> 37:47.072
Unfortunately, now that you know,
there's very little you can do about it.

37:47.145 --> 37:49.909
Tomorrow you'll be
on your way to Germany.

37:52.150 --> 37:55.449
In the meantime, Major,
please do not try to escape.

37:55.787 --> 37:58.449
All you will achieve is an early death.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.116
Gentlemen, have a pleasant journey.

38:04.763 --> 38:06.230
Mr. Bremer.

38:07.932 --> 38:10.457
Are my parents all right?
You promised me.

38:10.535 --> 38:12.969
- They're all right.
- When will I get to see them?

38:13.037 --> 38:15.733
They are on board.
You may see them tonight...

38:15.974 --> 38:18.033
before you leave for Germany.

38:18.109 --> 38:20.441
And then you'll turn them loose?

38:20.512 --> 38:23.379
If everything goes according to plan.

38:23.782 --> 38:27.411
I'm going to see them now.
I'll tell them of your concern.

38:55.713 --> 38:57.613
Prepare to get underway.

38:57.715 --> 39:00.650
All engines ahead one quarter.

39:00.985 --> 39:03.545
Your course: 163 degrees.

39:17.735 --> 39:18.793
Hello.

39:19.137 --> 39:21.605
Nothing today. Come back tomorrow.

39:21.673 --> 39:24.733
You don't understand.
You see, I'm looking for an actress.

39:24.809 --> 39:26.606
You came to the right place.

39:26.678 --> 39:30.011
She's 5'2". She's got blonde hair,
blue eyes, and...

39:31.916 --> 39:33.110
slinky.

39:33.818 --> 39:34.842
Slinky?

39:34.919 --> 39:36.318
Yeah, you know.

39:38.923 --> 39:40.584
She's slinky.

39:40.658 --> 39:41.784
What's her name?

39:41.860 --> 39:44.761
That's the problem. I don't know
her name. That's why I'm here.

39:44.829 --> 39:47.457
Hundreds of girls
come through here every day.

39:47.532 --> 39:50.194
All those girls,
they do have pictures, right?

39:50.268 --> 39:53.965
Sure, but as I just said,
there are hundreds of them.

39:54.539 --> 39:58.532
You see, this is very important.
I really have to find that girl.

39:58.610 --> 40:01.579
- All right, come on in.
- Thank you very much.

40:11.823 --> 40:13.484
That's not the end.

40:13.558 --> 40:14.923
Here you are.

40:41.152 --> 40:42.949
- Any problems?
- None.

40:47.525 --> 40:49.789
Your son sends his best wishes.

41:00.705 --> 41:02.696
The prisoners will be transferred
to a truck...

41:02.774 --> 41:06.232
and then taken to a point on the coast
where a U-boat can pick them up.

41:06.311 --> 41:08.575
What about the kid's parents?

41:08.646 --> 41:10.511
You won't really let them go, will you?

41:10.582 --> 41:12.277
What do you think?

41:12.884 --> 41:15.216
And that blonde, Gloria?

41:15.453 --> 41:17.580
We'll take care of her, too.

41:21.392 --> 41:22.723
That's her.

41:24.295 --> 41:25.694
Here she is.

41:26.531 --> 41:29.898
Gloria Beverly. You're right, she is slinky.

41:29.968 --> 41:31.629
Where can I get in touch with her?

41:31.703 --> 41:33.000
Right here on the lot.

41:33.071 --> 41:37.599
She's just been recommended for a term
contract by Mr. Mark Bremer personally.

41:38.610 --> 41:40.168
He said he didn't know her.

41:40.244 --> 41:42.075
They all say that, dear.

41:56.294 --> 41:57.556
Come in.

41:59.797 --> 42:01.856
- Gloria Beverly?
- That's me.

42:01.933 --> 42:05.164
- What movie are you doing, honey?
- I'm not in any movie.

42:05.236 --> 42:07.431
You mean you wear that for real?

42:07.505 --> 42:11.032
Yes, I do.
In a moment you're going to find out why.

42:11.676 --> 42:14.110
I'm going to ask you some questions.

42:14.178 --> 42:15.577
And you're going to answer me.

42:15.647 --> 42:17.706
What are you doing?
Are you some kind of nut?

42:17.782 --> 42:20.478
You're going to answer me with the truth.

42:20.551 --> 42:24.453
It was Mr. Bremer who arranged
Sgt. Willard's kidnapping, wasn't it?

42:24.522 --> 42:25.580
Yes.

42:25.657 --> 42:29.457
Now Maj. Trevor and Jim Ames
are missing, too. Has he taken them?

42:29.527 --> 42:30.653
Yes.

42:30.728 --> 42:33.094
- Where?
- I don't know.

42:33.164 --> 42:37.100
Does Mr. Bremer have a private yacht,
an airplane, anything like that?

42:37.168 --> 42:38.157
No.

42:38.236 --> 42:40.602
A private place where no one else goes.

42:40.672 --> 42:44.233
The only private place
he wanted to show me was his bedroom.

42:44.308 --> 42:47.175
Whatever he's involved in,
it's the studio...

42:47.478 --> 42:48.809
or his estate.

42:48.880 --> 42:52.247
There's got to be someplace else.
Now, think.

42:52.650 --> 42:54.845
- There is this one place.
- Where?

42:54.919 --> 42:57.683
He has a hold on Stage 12
right here on the lot.

43:49.507 --> 43:51.168
It's so realistic.

43:51.843 --> 43:53.470
It certainly is.

43:54.545 --> 43:56.945
But it looks like we're too late.

44:03.521 --> 44:05.318
They probably faked this...

44:05.389 --> 44:09.587
to make sure none of them tried
to escape until all four were captured.

44:10.094 --> 44:12.221
Well, where have they taken them to?

44:12.296 --> 44:14.355
An airfield, a dock, who knows?

44:14.432 --> 44:16.627
How are we going to find them?

44:17.001 --> 44:18.229
Wait a minute.

44:18.302 --> 44:22.602
Gloria Beverly said that it was
either the studio or his estate.

44:22.673 --> 44:24.538
And they are not here.

44:52.336 --> 44:55.362
As soon as the other truck arrives,
put them aboard.

44:55.439 --> 44:58.408
Why not take this one,
save making the transfer?

44:58.476 --> 45:02.207
This is a studio truck,
if it's not returned, it will be missed.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.475
All right, Major. Inside.

45:17.061 --> 45:18.585
Mom, Dad.

45:35.479 --> 45:38.642
Okay, here they come.
Let's get them out of here.

46:06.177 --> 46:07.337
Wonder Woman!

46:09.847 --> 46:12.475
Stay right there. Do not move.

46:20.558 --> 46:22.082
She's been hit.

46:24.896 --> 46:27.694
Now stay where you are,
you understand me?

46:29.166 --> 46:32.966
I understand you, Bremer,
and I don't care anymore.

46:33.037 --> 46:34.299
Jim, don't!

46:42.613 --> 46:44.638
All right, hold it, Bremer.

46:44.715 --> 46:46.114
On your feet.

46:49.720 --> 46:51.483
Nice work, soldier.

46:51.555 --> 46:54.956
That's exactly what one would expect
from a brave man.

46:56.527 --> 46:57.994
Thanks, Major.

46:59.363 --> 47:01.388
And thank those two women.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.594
Come on.

47:11.542 --> 47:13.373
- You're not hurt.
- No.

47:14.011 --> 47:15.273
So why did you...

47:15.346 --> 47:16.870
After what you told me about Jim...

47:16.948 --> 47:19.314
I wanted to give him a chance
to prove himself.

47:19.383 --> 47:20.975
And he did, didn't he?

47:21.052 --> 47:22.952
Yes, he certainly did.

47:27.091 --> 47:29.651
Lieutenant, Sergeant,
put them in the truck.

47:38.235 --> 47:42.467
I wish I could meet Wonder Girl again,
under different circumstances.

47:42.773 --> 47:44.400
And Wonder Woman.

47:55.319 --> 47:57.048
- Steve, you were wonderful.
- Thank you.

47:57.121 --> 47:59.487
Very moving. You know, Etta...

47:59.557 --> 48:02.958
this picture will give a big boost
to the morale of all our armed forces.

48:03.027 --> 48:05.495
It will boost the morale of our Allies, too.

48:05.563 --> 48:06.791
It really is a great movie.

48:06.864 --> 48:09.526
I'm glad I was able to see it
before going home on leave.

48:09.600 --> 48:11.625
So am I. How long will you be gone?

48:12.403 --> 48:15.566
Three or four days. A celebration at home.

48:16.007 --> 48:18.908
- A birthday?
- No. An anniversary.

48:19.377 --> 48:22.938
At least we can all have dinner together
before we go our separate ways.

48:23.014 --> 48:24.641
Hot dogs and ice cream?

48:24.715 --> 48:26.182
Whatever you want.

48:26.250 --> 48:28.309
You know, General,
there's one thing I regret.

48:28.386 --> 48:31.048
That Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl
weren't in the picture.

48:31.122 --> 48:32.953
They're the real stars.

48:33.024 --> 48:34.082
Superstars.

48:34.158 --> 48:36.149
Did I ever tell you
of the time Wonder Woman...

48:36.227 --> 48:37.592
Four times, Major.

48:37.661 --> 48:39.128
All right. Come on, you two.

48:39.196 --> 48:41.892
