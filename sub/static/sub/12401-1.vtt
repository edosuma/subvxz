14:45.919 --> 14:48.119
let's see about your boy.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.860
              ♪ ♪

14:55.862 --> 14:58.196
      They really do need to get
      more organic produce here.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.964
   The selection is pathetic.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.075
         Organic shredded wheat.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.912
                 High in fiber.
                 Poops be solid.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.954
       You shouldn't have
       brought me here.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.256
    I don't know what I ever did
    to make you hate me so much.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.625
  I don't hate you, Megan.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.861
        Then why do you avoid me
        like the plague?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.902
        If I get you this,
        you'll call me next time

15:37.904 --> 15:39.304
           you need something...

15:39.306 --> 15:40.905
     and not the one
     person on Earth

15:40.907 --> 15:42.307
    you're not supposed to call?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.143
      (sighs)

15:45.145 --> 15:47.445
Do your 12-year-old students
notice your condescending tone

15:47.447 --> 15:48.947
  or is that just me?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.715
           Pretty much just you.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.917
           I don't want you to
           get in trouble again.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.719
               Is that so wrong?

15:57.924 --> 15:59.390
 I won't call her.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.064
                Soup preference?

16:06.066 --> 16:07.532
             Ech.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.970
              (murmuring voices)

16:14.140 --> 16:16.174
            WOMAN:
            Kyle Barnes is here.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.376
            That must be a sign,
            I tell you.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.045
              Kyle Barnes?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.482
   Uh, yeah.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.285
         We went to church
         with your mother, Kyle.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.354
             Do you remember me?
             Florence Hall?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.823
  Uh... okay.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.459
It's been a long time.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.828
It's good to see you.
            And you too, dear.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.330
      Haven't seen you in church
      in a long time.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.299
               You really should
               attend a sermon.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.601
       Yeah.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.303
   I'll try.

16:45.305 --> 16:49.540
   We're asking everyone in Rome
   to pray for the Austin boy.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.943
        Hm.
         You know the family?

16:51.945 --> 16:53.544
  Uh, I don't. No.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.381
           Their son, Joshua,
           bright boy.

16:56.383 --> 17:00.351
            He's fallen prey
            to dark forces.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.521
         It's like what happened
         to your poor mother
         all over again.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.723
        It is such a shame.
        So terrible.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.359
   And so soon
   after the Conners family.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.529
               Reverend Anderson
               has been visiting

17:11.531 --> 17:12.964
         little Joshua all week.

17:12.965 --> 17:16.134
   Can you keep him
   in your thoughts and prayers?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.535
        Yeah.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.737
 I can do that. Sure.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.739
               You were always
               such a sweet boy.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.977
        We should be going, Flo.

17:25.979 --> 17:28.246
           I hope I'll see you
           soon at the service.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.981
      I'll try.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.083
                      Great.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.818
                      Thank you.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.824
     Are they kidding
     with that fucking nonsense?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.226
               "Dark forces"?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.694
             Please.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.663
     Your mother was sick,
     and some people

17:45.665 --> 17:47.665
     in this backwards town
     are crazy.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.469
                 Kyle?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.409
    (crashing and screaming)

18:02.749 --> 18:04.749
            (screams)
              REVEREND ANDERSON:
              Come on!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.117
          Come on! Come on!

18:06.119 --> 18:08.086
Come out and face me, coward!
               (screams)

18:08.088 --> 18:10.955
In the name of Jesus,
I command you to
release this child!

18:10.957 --> 18:12.090
You're hurting him!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.624
         Go downstairs!

18:13.626 --> 18:14.792
       Look into my eyes

18:14.794 --> 18:16.627
       and see the power
       I hold over you.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.863
The power given to me
by the Almighty God our Lord.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.399
                  No... power.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.800
  You don't belong here.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.402
     In the name of Jesus,

18:24.404 --> 18:26.270
I cast you out!
              (screams)

18:29.476 --> 18:30.675
           Oh my God.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.313
  Oil of the spirit

18:35.315 --> 18:38.149
 and the holy water
 of the cleansing of God...

18:38.151 --> 18:39.283
                     (screams)

18:41.154 --> 18:42.220
    Joshua!

18:42.222 --> 18:44.555
     Baby, wake up.
                 Betsy, get out!

18:44.557 --> 18:46.324
     Just wake up, baby.
            Get the fuck out!

18:46.326 --> 18:47.592
                 (grunts)
               Oh!

18:47.594 --> 18:49.427
             (grunts)
            (screams)

18:49.429 --> 18:50.661
                Oh!

18:50.663 --> 18:52.597
  Heavenly Father,
  please grant me the strength

18:52.599 --> 18:54.165
     to overcome this evil
     I now face!

18:54.167 --> 18:55.600
            Allow me to
            drive this demon out
           Joshua!

18:55.602 --> 18:57.335
 so that his body can be
 filled with the Holy Ghost

18:57.337 --> 18:59.837
and put back
upon a path to your glory!

18:59.839 --> 19:01.038
           (screams)

19:05.512 --> 19:07.745
          KYLE: Appreciate this.
  MEGAN: The hell?

19:07.747 --> 19:10.181
  Is that gratitude?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.449
(laughs)

19:11.451 --> 19:12.750
            Shut up.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.852
MAN (over radio):
Your father was
a coal miner.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.420
Your grandfather
was a coal miner.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.590
     This boy those women
     are talking about...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.225
       you hear anything?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.663
Don't go down that road again.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.031
I remember when
you first moved in,

19:27.033 --> 19:28.466
before Mom
and Dad adopted you.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.536
You thought there were demons
hiding in every shadow.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.938
And Anderson really filled
your head with some bullshit.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.875
          I'm just worried
          about that boy.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.112
  Yeah, well, not much
  you can do there.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.519
             Hey!

19:48.521 --> 19:49.854
               You lost?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.389
    If you're gonna
    backseat drive,

19:51.391 --> 19:53.191
  climb in
  the back fuckin' seat.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.625
        Where are you taking me?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.460
Come on! You've never
even seen the new house!

19:56.462 --> 19:58.062
            Oh, my...
It's been two years!

19:58.064 --> 19:59.297
      Damn it, Megan! No!

19:59.299 --> 20:01.966
        I know you don't want
        me around your daughter.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.035
     Your husband hates me.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.237
      Please.
A nice dinner
will be good for you.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.872
You can shower
with actual hot water.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.707
 I'll give you some
 of Mark's old clothes.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.976
                        Oh, God.
      Holly loves you.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.216
You don't hate us enough
to jump from a moving car.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.785
    I'll take that as a win.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.404
       Uh, Megan brought me over
       against my will.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.505
                Honest.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.175
             Look, Mark,
             I'm the only person

20:44.177 --> 20:45.376
               who wants me here
               less than you do.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.278
            Believe me, man.
            You know how she is.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.447
    Do I ever.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.115
      MEGAN:
      Honey, is that you?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.283
   Yep.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.522
       Nice shirt.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.427
Hey, doodlebug.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.895
       Uncle Kyle is here.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.265
Yeah, I know that.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.133
I saw him with my own eyes.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.971
Listen, sweetie, can you go
on up to your room?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.539
   Need to talk to your mama.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.510
          Go on. Scoot.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.647
              Now, Holly.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.482
          Yes, ma'am.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.454
  Megan, why?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.457
Come on. You know
how I feel about this.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.526
           It's just one
           goddamn dinner, okay?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.829
  Do you really think
  he's stable?

21:38.831 --> 21:41.966
I mean, you can't tell me
that you feel safe
around him.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.001
You think it's a good idea to
bring him around our daughter?

21:44.003 --> 21:47.004
            Well, he's in there,
            she's in here.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.506
           Oh, okay.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.174
   So, he's just gonna
   eat in there alone?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.509
That's not gonna be awkward?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.013
  Look...

21:56.015 --> 21:59.517
I know what he did for you
when you were younger...

21:59.519 --> 22:01.852
and we can never
thank him enough for that.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.956
But he took a turn
when he got older, okay?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.359
You can't ignore that!

22:08.361 --> 22:10.695
How can you be okay
with him being here
after what he did?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.530
          He made a mistake
          and he did a horrible,

22:12.532 --> 22:14.498
      unforgivable thing, and...

22:14.500 --> 22:16.367
    (whispers)
    damn it, he's paid for that.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.601
           It's ruined his life,

22:17.603 --> 22:19.203
          and I'm gonna be here
          for him.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.771
                          What?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.841
         You think
         he's gonna attack Holly
         over the dinner table?

22:30.116 --> 22:33.050
               It's just dinner,
               just one night.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.219
    He's not gonna hurt anybody.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.122
              Please, Mark.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.293
         Please let me do
         something nice for him.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.696
           He's got nothin'.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.442
                           Hey.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.912
                       Uh...

23:03.516 --> 23:04.582
         You remember me, right?

23:04.584 --> 23:06.917
  I'm-- I'm your mama's brother.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.487
 You hurt your little girl,

23:09.489 --> 23:11.989
  and now you're not
  her daddy anymore.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.963
               (voice breaking)
               That's not...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.837
            (door opens, closes)

23:32.712 --> 23:34.545
         What is it, honey?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.247
      Uncle Kyle left.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.450
  Shit. Kyle!

23:48.294 --> 23:49.794
         Why would he leave?

23:49.796 --> 23:52.596
(sighs)
Why look a gift horse
in the mouth?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.632
            Asshole.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.867
  I'm sure he's fine.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.304
We need to get a patrol car,
have 'em pick him up,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.139
drive him home?

24:03.242 --> 24:04.975
                 Let him walk.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.645
            All he ever wants
            is to be alone.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.653
         (dog barking)

24:19.992 --> 24:21.559
     (car engine starting)

24:25.898 --> 24:27.665
       (car driving away)

25:09.675 --> 25:10.941
             (beep)

25:18.017 --> 25:20.017
         (line ringing)

25:21.387 --> 25:23.587
          (vibrating)

25:26.993 --> 25:28.225
         Hello?

25:34.667 --> 25:36.300
       Kyle, is that you?

25:48.581 --> 25:49.813
             (beep)

25:51.884 --> 25:52.917
          (door opens)

25:52.919 --> 25:54.652
      Amber, honey, come inside!

25:58.224 --> 25:59.590
             (beep)

26:21.781 --> 26:24.515
       (thunder rumbling)

26:28.588 --> 26:30.921
   MAN (on TV):
   Temperatures are expected
   to drop tonight

26:30.923 --> 26:34.058
    with scattered showers
    throughout the afternoon
    and into tomorrow.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.460
     We should see
     some sunshine here...

26:39.298 --> 26:40.898
             Howdy.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.933
    Offer still good
    to borrow your car?

26:44.036 --> 26:45.269
                 Sure.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.643
                  (dogs barking)

27:12.498 --> 27:14.198
        (door unlocking)

27:18.804 --> 27:20.070
               Yeah?

27:21.007 --> 27:23.007
          Uh...

27:23.009 --> 27:26.910
 I heard about your boy, and...

27:26.912 --> 27:28.212
             um...

27:30.583 --> 27:33.183
 Reverend Anderson, is he here?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.419
                        Hold on.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.935
          Kyle Barnes.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.072
         This is a surprise.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.474
Yeah, I know, Reverend.

27:57.476 --> 28:01.011
It's, uh, been a long time.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.215
       I didn't know
       you were in town.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.684
 Yeah, um...

28:06.686 --> 28:08.452
back about five months now.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.188
           I wish we were seeing
           each other

28:11.190 --> 28:13.791
  under different circumstances,
  but I'm glad you're here.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.460
    Okay.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.096
       Uh...

28:22.468 --> 28:23.767
              Hold on, Reverend.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.071
                 I didn't come
                 to see the boy.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.206
          Not to help, at least.
          I came 'cause...

28:31.677 --> 28:33.377
            I don't really know.

28:34.647 --> 28:36.313
      Sure you do.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.552
         What you think I did,
         I assure you, I didn't.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.053
ANDERSON:
Uh-huh.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.822
Doctors think
you should be in therapy,

28:44.824 --> 28:46.523
but we know what this is.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.158
         We don't know anything.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.162
Whatever you think
happened to your mother,

28:52.164 --> 28:53.997
it was you who stopped it.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.700
             My mother was sick.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.368
             I don't know
             much else about it.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.003
              I was just a kid.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.074
These things are everywhere.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.210
 They're all around us.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.511
    Now, you've been gone
    a long time.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.680
   You have no idea
   how bad it's gotten.

29:09.682 --> 29:11.215
And you might not believe it,

29:11.217 --> 29:13.383
but that doesn't make it
any less true.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.285
              Why don't we stick
              to what we know

29:15.287 --> 29:18.088
    before we start
    blaming the bogeyman again?

29:26.132 --> 29:27.965
   JOSHUA: (breathing heavily)

29:37.476 --> 29:39.309
    (breathing heavily)

29:39.311 --> 29:40.844
          (muttering)

29:51.724 --> 29:54.558
He's showing signs
of very animal-like behavior,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.059
                which is common.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.565
      (heavy breathing stops)

30:14.480 --> 30:16.413
             (rasping)
             I know you.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.719
  You think so, huh?

30:27.827 --> 30:30.928
When's the last time
you went to school, Joshua?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.362
 Pretty cool
 getting to skip out

30:32.364 --> 30:34.431
on school like this,
isn't it?

30:36.302 --> 30:38.101
         (normal voice)
         I like school.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.372
         I miss my friends.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.675
 Well, I'm sure
 they miss you too, bud.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.843
Why don't you stop all this,

30:45.845 --> 30:47.978
so things can go
back to normal?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.646
You're scaring your mom.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.582
You're wasting
this man's time.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.151
Stop pretending, Joshua.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.820
      He-- he hasn't been
      speaking like this before.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.055
               This is new.

30:58.057 --> 31:01.024
            (rasping)
            You're all grown up.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.194
             You barely even fit
             in that pantry now.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.230
       What?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.799
            Padlock on the door.

31:08.801 --> 31:12.069
       You used to draw pictures
       on the walls.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.739
             Don't you remember?

31:17.243 --> 31:19.243
You're talking nonsense.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.646
        I know you, Kyle Barnes.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.422
What do you know, huh?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.825
Got any idea what
you're talking about
with all that?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.429
You're just a damn kid.
You don't know shit.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.497
             Kyle, just--

31:40.499 --> 31:42.499
 Sorry. I-- I'm sorry.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.801
       We all know what we know.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.339
Why don't you tell me
what you know then, huh?

31:50.509 --> 31:52.376
   Come on, kid.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.744
Why don't you say something

31:53.746 --> 31:56.446
that makes one goddamn
bit of sense?

31:56.448 --> 31:58.448
Right now!
    Just keep your distance.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.350
He's playing games with us.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.451
      ANDERSON: Sit down.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.421
            I'll light the sage.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.290
    This-- this should calm him.
    Just, uh...

32:06.292 --> 32:09.726
          give it a few moments
          to-- to fill the room.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.196
           So long have we tried
           to find you, Outcast.

32:13.198 --> 32:17.634
      Too long have you
      hidden your light from us.
     Now you heed this.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.603
   In the name of the Father,
          Dull. Making us search

32:19.605 --> 32:21.371
 the Son, and the Holy Ghost--
           through the darkness.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.006
         (clattering)
        JOSHUA: (screams)

32:25.210 --> 32:28.679
                      (growling)
           (groaning)

32:37.890 --> 32:40.657
                     (grunting)

32:40.659 --> 32:41.959
     JOSHUA: (screams)

32:41.961 --> 32:43.160
           (coughing)

32:46.231 --> 32:47.998
                       (panting)

32:48.000 --> 32:49.967
KYLE: (coughs)

32:49.969 --> 32:51.935
    (coughs)

32:51.937 --> 32:53.503
                         Here.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.176
                      (growling)

33:21.200 --> 33:22.599
                 Here.

33:23.669 --> 33:24.768
       No.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.678
He ever try to do
that to you?

33:37.116 --> 33:38.615
What about what
he was saying in there?

33:38.617 --> 33:40.117
 Any of that make sense?

33:40.119 --> 33:43.453
About him... knowing me?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.790
          Demons are tricksters.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.560
       They want you
       to be more scared
       of them than you need to.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.463
         With the power
         of God on our side,
         we got nothing to fear.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.667
"The power of God?"

33:57.669 --> 33:59.803
   You think your mother
   and Joshua are the only ones?

34:01.573 --> 34:04.074
   There's a house like this one

34:04.076 --> 34:06.676
       in every town,
       in every country
       of this whole wide world.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.879
And you go
into those houses?

34:11.817 --> 34:14.384
                     Yes, I do.
Well,
what makes you think

34:14.386 --> 34:16.887
             you can do anything
             about that?

34:18.924 --> 34:20.424
             You want my advice?

34:20.426 --> 34:21.958
      Run.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.462
  While you still
  got something left.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.067
              There was a time
              I might have taken
              that advice.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.672
      You know,
      I wasn't always the, uh...

34:36.675 --> 34:40.444
        the gung-ho holy warrior
        you see before you.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.647
             I served God,
             tended my flock...

34:45.117 --> 34:47.083
               but I questioned.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.454
 Then I went into your house...

34:51.924 --> 34:53.956
 and I saw the devil was real.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.525
               And I didn't
               question anymore.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.027
              My path was clear.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.263
              I don't believe
              it's a coincidence

35:00.265 --> 35:02.466
              that you set
              me upon that path,

35:02.468 --> 35:05.402
            and here you are,
            walkin' it yourself,

35:05.404 --> 35:07.370
          facing all this again.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.708
      And I don't believe
      you're gonna run.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.547
                  (sighs)

35:22.654 --> 35:25.222
        (engine revving)

35:38.770 --> 35:40.904
                Hey, Caleb.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.373
             Working late?
      Yeah. (grunts)

35:44.843 --> 35:47.177
         This railing was loose.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.779
                Didn't want any
                of our old folks
                taking a tumble.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.348
     Thank you kindly.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.184
           I also noticed
           your screen door is
           coming of its hinges.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.520
     Might want to get you
     a new one before we paint.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.821
       Paint?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.090
  I think we can hold off
  for another year.

36:00.092 --> 36:03.160
 Money'd be better spent
 on more important things
 than a pretty house.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.496
           Let me just show you.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.168
(boy laughs)

36:14.206 --> 36:15.705
            (laughs)

36:25.484 --> 36:27.384
                   Damn.
      Yep.

36:29.221 --> 36:32.289
Maybe we could
put up a fence.
                     No.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.558
                  No, they'd
                  only climb it.
     Hm...

36:34.560 --> 36:36.960
                  You know what?
                  Leave it.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.830
   You sure?
                   Yeah.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.899
                 Yeah, let 'em
                 have their fun.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.835
                We can turn
                the other cheek.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.103
              Mmm.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.908
               (chuckles)

36:54.680 --> 36:56.046

Uh, sorry,
I had it all day.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.856
        I got some stew
        going inside

38:46.858 --> 38:48.191
      if you haven't had dinner.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.529
    Yeah, sure.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.597
   That sounds good.

38:56.268 --> 39:01.604
Elise, I'm sure
you don't remember her, but...

39:01.606 --> 39:05.008
           she died
           a year ago this week.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.377
      I'm sorry.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.045
     I didn't know.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.480
             (sighs)

39:10.482 --> 39:14.317
         We were married
         longer than we weren't.

39:14.319 --> 39:18.321
             Alone just don't...
             feel right.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.323
It gets scarier when it does.

39:20.325 --> 39:24.027
             I never spent a day
             away from her.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.395
       Barely got through

39:25.397 --> 39:28.965
         a conversation
         without her help.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.735
    Don't expect you to know
    what it's like to lose that.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.740
    Uh, Allison was a...

39:39.010 --> 39:42.812
Well, I started out
just wanting to look at her.

39:44.716 --> 39:48.151
 And then all I ever wanted
 to do was listen to her.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.553
But, um, you know, I...

39:50.555 --> 39:53.356
I think she's the only person
who has ever...

39:53.358 --> 39:55.658
     truly known me.

39:58.697 --> 40:02.165
        I'm sorry for your loss.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.933
Oh, she... She didn't die.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.769
      We just, uh...

40:08.006 --> 40:09.439
     It didn't work.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.085
  Elise...

40:23.688 --> 40:27.190
she would want me to tell you
how sorry I am.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.760
We knew
what was happenin'.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.531
Found you hiding
under our porch often enough.

40:35.634 --> 40:39.702
       We didn't realize
       how bad it was.

40:39.704 --> 40:44.474
 All of that racket,
 it sounded like... discipline.

40:46.445 --> 40:49.979
It haunted us both.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.783
          Uh...

40:53.785 --> 40:56.286
    It was a long time ago,
    you know?

40:56.288 --> 40:58.087
   Don't mean it's okay.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.522
                    Kyle?

41:02.494 --> 41:05.061
Any time you see
a light on,

41:05.063 --> 41:06.963
        you come by.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.498
      I'm here...

41:08.500 --> 41:10.400
 for whatever you need.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.613
       Thanks for the ride.
       My neighbor's a good guy.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.415
    I don't wanna borrow his car
    two days in a row.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.485
           Sorry about the mess.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.686
    Just throw them in the back.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.254
               It's for the kids
               in the hospital.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.958
    Folks think being a preacher
    is a Sunday job.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.526
       I spend more time
       in this little old beater

41:36.528 --> 41:38.261
        than I do in the pulpit.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.331
             Click it or ticket.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.700
               Oh.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.101
      (car engine starts)

41:57.883 --> 41:59.749
             That your son?

42:00.986 --> 42:02.085
      Yeah.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.420
   Matthew.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.391
You know, I could always
use a hand delivering meals

42:08.393 --> 42:09.726
if you got the time.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.896
             No. I'm... not good
             around people.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.030
      Really?

42:15.300 --> 42:16.699
You holed up in that house

42:16.701 --> 42:19.235
five months in town
without showing your face.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.438
Is that because what happened
to your mother?

42:23.408 --> 42:26.175
You think you caused it?

42:26.177 --> 42:29.646
You weren't around Joshua.
It still happened to him.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.981
What if you're punishing
yourself for no reason?

42:31.983 --> 42:33.883
              What if I'm right?

42:33.885 --> 42:36.553
Then why are you coming
with me?

42:38.356 --> 42:39.989
                To find answers.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.960
Is that why
you came back to Rome?

42:45.096 --> 42:46.829
I heard you had a family.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.632
Things were going
good for you.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.003
  Maybe I just missed the house.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.944
       (heavy breathing)

43:08.019 --> 43:09.619
        (bones cracking)

43:23.902 --> 43:27.036
      (footsteps approach)

43:38.049 --> 43:40.984
        I read scripture to him.
        It didn't do anything.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.487
         Holy water
         irritated him severely,

43:44.489 --> 43:46.456
    but had no long-term effect.

43:47.392 --> 43:49.158
            (growls)

43:53.064 --> 43:55.064
          Will you pray with me?

44:06.144 --> 44:08.845
   You are very brave to return.

44:10.181 --> 44:12.081
                 He doesn't like
                 the light.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.051
        My mother didn't either.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.061
(screams)

44:27.298 --> 44:29.499
That day with her,
it was the same.

44:29.501 --> 44:32.368
              (growls)
          Why don't you
          like light, Joshua?

44:32.370 --> 44:33.670
            (growls)

44:33.672 --> 44:36.339
         Think back on that day.
         What else did you do?

44:40.045 --> 44:41.277
   I hit her.

44:42.881 --> 44:45.014
She attacked me, and...

44:45.016 --> 44:46.449
I'd had enough.

44:46.451 --> 44:48.685
She'd done it
many times before.

44:48.687 --> 44:50.053
This time, I fought back.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.289
 It seemed to...

44:53.291 --> 44:54.891
    hurt her.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.793
More than it should've.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.329
            Just help me get him
            into the light.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.665
            Don't touch me!
            Don't touch me!

45:02.667 --> 45:04.000
        Come on. Don't think
        about your mother!

45:04.002 --> 45:05.568
   Think about the boy! Come on!

45:05.570 --> 45:07.804
               No! (screams)
 You're leaning on
 my last nerve, boy!

45:07.806 --> 45:09.138
                     No! No!
You're unwelcome here!

45:09.140 --> 45:10.707
You do not belong here!

45:10.709 --> 45:12.408
       (screams)
In the name of God,
I cast you out,

45:12.410 --> 45:14.210
no matter how long it takes!

45:14.212 --> 45:15.712
     (screams)

45:21.519 --> 45:22.652
                (screams)
         (grunts)

45:29.494 --> 45:30.993
(grunts)

45:30.995 --> 45:33.663
          Stronger than Allison.

45:33.665 --> 45:35.231
   (shouts)

45:37.702 --> 45:39.836
               (growling)

45:57.856 --> 45:59.055
           (stammers)

45:59.057 --> 46:00.757
       (growls)
                   (yelps)

46:04.028 --> 46:05.261
     (screams)

46:07.899 --> 46:08.998
               (screams)

46:10.301 --> 46:11.634
          Kyle!

46:13.238 --> 46:14.971
What do you want from me?

46:17.609 --> 46:19.408
      (grunts)
           Kyle!

46:19.410 --> 46:20.510
     You gotta stop it!

46:22.313 --> 46:24.814
Why won't you leave me alone?
           (screams)

46:26.151 --> 46:27.550
                       (screams)

46:29.053 --> 46:30.720
           (sizzling)

46:32.590 --> 46:34.056
              (groans, sputters)

46:39.397 --> 46:40.863
  (sizzling)
                 (screams)

46:49.741 --> 46:51.174
              (panting)

46:53.745 --> 46:58.381
              The great merge...
              cannot be stopped.

47:25.376 --> 47:26.509
            (yelps)

47:28.880 --> 47:30.913
           (panting)

47:36.721 --> 47:39.222
         (coughing)

47:48.800 --> 47:50.132
          (door opens)

47:55.540 --> 47:56.939
             Mama?

48:07.352 --> 48:08.985
     (police radio chatter)

48:09.921 --> 48:12.255
          (chattering)

48:14.325 --> 48:15.725
     (police radio chatter)

48:22.100 --> 48:24.567
   (indistinct conversation)

48:41.219 --> 48:43.953
You're free to go.
                What?

48:43.955 --> 48:45.755
    Chief, you can't be serious.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.292
     Nothing happened here,
     Officer Holter.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.594
The mother's saying it's just
one big misunderstanding.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.095
                    What?

48:53.097 --> 48:55.197
     Look, just because you're
     friends with the preacher--

48:55.199 --> 48:57.967
    It doesn't matter
    what we think happened.

48:57.969 --> 48:59.635
You can drag him into town,

48:59.637 --> 49:01.070
file all the paperwork
you want.

49:01.072 --> 49:04.540
       The fact is,
       the mother refuses
       to press charges.

49:04.542 --> 49:06.742
      There's nothing more
      for us to do here.

49:06.744 --> 49:08.878
      Let's wrap this up.

49:23.895 --> 49:25.561
      (handcuffs clicking)

49:25.563 --> 49:27.663
After everything
Megan's done for you...

49:39.978 --> 49:41.844
                   Come on.

49:41.846 --> 49:43.346
                  Take you home.

50:27.058 --> 50:29.458
         Did you get the answers
         you were looking for?

50:30.695 --> 50:32.061
           Some.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.301
                I've seen a lot.

50:41.639 --> 50:43.839
            Thought I'd seen
            the worst suffering
            a man could imagine,

50:43.841 --> 50:45.474
               but that was...

50:48.546 --> 50:50.946
        I've never seen anything
        like that before.

50:53.818 --> 50:56.419
    That what it was like
    with your mother in the end?

50:58.489 --> 51:00.423
     Different with her.

51:02.593 --> 51:06.128
    It wasn't like that
    with my wife either.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.268
I always thought it was
something I did to them.

51:13.271 --> 51:15.337
    Now I know
    it's something else.

51:16.441 --> 51:18.441
It's still because of me.

51:20.945 --> 51:23.446
Seems like they've been
coming after me my whole life.
