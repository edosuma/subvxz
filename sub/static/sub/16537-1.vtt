02:24.062 --> 02:25.772
What?

02:26.773 --> 02:28.023
Hey.

02:52.799 --> 02:56.549
Hey. Hey! Hey, you okay?

02:58.012 --> 03:00.012
Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:01.724 --> 03:03.184
Please.

03:03.268 --> 03:05.768
Please don't be dead. You okay?

03:05.854 --> 03:08.234
Hello. Hey. Hey.

03:08.314 --> 03:09.569
Hey, you okay?

03:09.649 --> 03:12.939
Hello? Hello? Hello?

03:13.027 --> 03:16.027
Please don't be dead. Come on.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.621
Oh. Uh...

03:19.701 --> 03:22.201
And two. Breathe.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.747
Holy shit.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.732
Heh. That was funny.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.034
Heh. That was really funny.

03:57.530 --> 04:00.280
You know, I...

04:00.366 --> 04:03.656
I had always hoped
that right before I die...

04:05.413 --> 04:10.253
...my life would flash before my eyes
and I would see wonderful things...

04:12.837 --> 04:18.337
A life full of parties and friends and...

04:18.426 --> 04:21.386
and how I'd learned to play the guitar,

04:21.471 --> 04:26.561
and... and maybe there'd even be a girl.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.983
But as I was hanging up there...

04:30.647 --> 04:33.437
...I didn't really see much of anything.

04:36.069 --> 04:37.859
But I did see you.

04:39.072 --> 04:41.742
And I know...
I know it sounds dumb, but I...

04:41.824 --> 04:43.954
I really thought for a moment that...

04:44.035 --> 04:47.035
that maybe, just maybe there was
a reason that you...

06:49.410 --> 06:51.700
# Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #

06:51.788 --> 06:53.458
# Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #

06:53.539 --> 06:57.419
# Ay ay ay, ay ay #

06:57.502 --> 07:00.132
- # Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #
- # Ay ay ay, ay ay #

07:14.685 --> 07:16.685
# Bra-da, bra-da #

07:16.771 --> 07:18.061
# Bra-da #

07:27.490 --> 07:29.870
Wait! Wait! Wait!

07:29.951 --> 07:32.201
Wait! Wait for me! Wait for me!

07:34.288 --> 07:37.498
Go! Go! Go!

09:19.143 --> 09:20.813
Cheese puffs?

09:52.218 --> 09:54.428
Hello, world!

10:06.023 --> 10:08.613
My name is Hank Thompson,

10:08.693 --> 10:14.743
and I've been stranded out on an island
in the Pacific all alone!

10:14.824 --> 10:16.494
And this man,

10:16.617 --> 10:20.747
this man saved me from the brink of death

10:20.830 --> 10:24.420
when he allowed me
to ride him like a jet ski,

10:24.500 --> 10:26.290
propelled by his f...

10:39.682 --> 10:41.892
How did you do that?

10:43.227 --> 10:45.347
Maybe... Maybe your...

10:45.438 --> 10:48.148
your gases built up from decomposition

10:48.232 --> 10:53.152
and maybe your soul leaving you?

10:53.237 --> 10:55.487
Why am I talking to you?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.211
Please work.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.277
Hello, world.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.833
I'm sorry.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.835
I gotta go.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.577
Hello!

12:24.495 --> 12:25.745
Hello.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.620
Help!

12:54.984 --> 12:58.824
Oh. You see that?

12:58.904 --> 13:01.160
There's gonna be people there.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.160
They're gonna feed us and take care of us.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.290
Everybody's gonna want to hear our story,

13:06.370 --> 13:09.210
and I'm gonna be all buff
from carrying you around.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.090
Ohh. That's not funny.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.014
Hello?

13:19.216 --> 13:20.546
Help.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.970
Help!

14:17.399 --> 14:20.239
# Oh, where did you come from,
where did you go? #

14:20.319 --> 14:22.859
# Where did you come from,
Cotton Eye Joe? #

14:22.947 --> 14:25.067
Man, it's always the song that you hate

14:25.157 --> 14:27.577
that gets stuck in your head.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.541
Uh, sorry.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.408
You can't sleep either?

15:48.157 --> 15:52.407
My mom used to sing this song to me
when I couldn't sleep

15:52.494 --> 15:56.964
so I wouldn't overthink things,
but I don't remember the words.

16:01.503 --> 16:05.803
# Crazy #

16:05.883 --> 16:11.809
# I'm fucking crazy #

16:11.889 --> 16:16.979
# Maybe, just maybe #

16:17.061 --> 16:23.531
# I'll make it alone #

16:47.007 --> 16:51.097
# Rescued #

16:51.178 --> 16:56.558
# I thought I was rescued #

16:56.642 --> 17:02.482
# But you're just a dead dude #

17:02.564 --> 17:09.364
# And I'm gonna die #

17:09.445 --> 17:11.736
# There's gotta be a better way #

17:11.824 --> 17:16.794
# To get out of here #

17:25.128 --> 17:30.429
# Where do you come from #

17:30.509 --> 17:34.009
# Cotton Eye Joe? #

17:51.280 --> 17:53.030
Let me eat you.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.794
Ahh!

18:15.179 --> 18:18.429
Huh? Come on!

18:18.515 --> 18:21.345
Somebody help!

18:22.519 --> 18:28.278
You're... you're just laying there
like a disgusting, useless sack of shit.

18:28.358 --> 18:31.198
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

18:33.197 --> 18:36.657
Thanks for your help, kind of.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.131
Why?

18:49.171 --> 18:52.091
No. No, no, no. No.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.594
No, you asshole. Stop it.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.349
Ohh! Ahh!

19:00.349 --> 19:02.349
Water! Water!

19:02.434 --> 19:04.064
What are you doing? What are you doing?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.564
What are you doing?

19:44.101 --> 19:45.731
Okay.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.447
Ah, you're the grossest thing
in this gross world.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.084
Wait. No.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.785
No, please. Please.

20:06.874 --> 20:09.254
Please, I'm sorry. Please don't stop.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.878
What?

20:14.965 --> 20:16.835
Mah... ehh.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.561
Mahn... ehh.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.604
Manny?

20:27.686 --> 20:29.476
Is that your name?

20:30.772 --> 20:33.612
Mahn... ehh.

20:33.692 --> 20:37.492
Hi, Manny. I'm Hank. Um...

20:39.865 --> 20:43.235
Hhh... nk.

20:43.327 --> 20:46.407
Hiiii.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.536
Hi.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.500
Huh... luh.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.495
Hello.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.707
- Hello...
- Hel... lo...

20:55.797 --> 20:57.417
- Hank.
- Hank.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.257
That's very good.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.221
I...

21:06.308 --> 21:09.808
Come on. Talk to me, buddy.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.109
Stop mumbling, please.

21:14.191 --> 21:17.281
Talk to me. Please. Speak up, Manny.

21:17.361 --> 21:20.861
How do you expect anyone to want to talk
to you if you sound retarded?

21:23.784 --> 21:26.164
I sound like my dad.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.213
I'm sorry.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.207
Hey. I didn't mean that.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.049
Hey, you talk however you want.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.049
You can mumble, look at your feet
all day long.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.472
Okay, buddy?

21:43.053 --> 21:44.641
Okay, buddy.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.533
Hi.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.743
Hello.

22:04.825 --> 22:08.615
Why did you hit me? Hey.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.374
Why did you hit me?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.503
I'm sorry. I...

22:15.585 --> 22:18.125
I thought you were dead.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.383
Am I dead?

22:20.465 --> 22:22.545
I don't think so. You're talking.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.349
But I sound retarded.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.219
No, no, you sound great.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.177
Don't say that word. I didn't...

22:29.266 --> 22:33.096
I'm a useless...

22:33.186 --> 22:35.556
- sack of shit?
- No, man.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.147
Hey.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.112
No. No, I didn't mean that.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.782
I was being an asshole.

22:41.862 --> 22:44.282
I'm not a sack of shit?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.953
No, you're amazing.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.953
You're... You're a miracle, or...

22:49.036 --> 22:51.616
or I'm just hallucinating from starvation.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.500
Uh-oh.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.125
This is... This is crazy.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.546
# Crazy #

23:05.635 --> 23:07.795
- No, no, no, no, no.
- # I'm fucking crazy #

23:07.888 --> 23:10.218
Hey, hey, hey. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop singing.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.057
You weren't supposed to hear that.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.898
Oh, I like that. Singing.

23:14.978 --> 23:20.568
Okay, can you remember
anything about before, your life?

23:20.650 --> 23:23.280
How you got here? Where we are?

23:23.403 --> 23:25.533
How you saved me?

23:25.614 --> 23:27.869
- Anything?
- Hey, what is that?

23:27.949 --> 23:29.788
Oh, that, no. I...

23:29.868 --> 23:32.288
Don't worry... Don't worry about that.

23:32.412 --> 23:36.002
What's important is that
we find a way to get home.

23:36.083 --> 23:40.003
Okay. I'm trying to remember.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.764
What is home?

23:46.927 --> 23:50.597
This is from home.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.890
It's normally full of these things
called cheese puffs.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.851
Okay.

23:55.936 --> 24:01.606
Um, sometimes, um, your fingers
would be coated in orange after eating it.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.740
And your mom probably
told you to wash your hands,

24:04.820 --> 24:07.910
but I bet you'd just lick it off
when she wasn't looking.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.958
- Anything?
- What?

24:15.038 --> 24:16.288
What?

24:16.373 --> 24:19.293
Wait. Wait, what's supposed to happen?

24:19.376 --> 24:21.336
I don't know. I thought...

24:21.461 --> 24:24.421
thought maybe I could tap
into some sense memory or something,

24:24.506 --> 24:27.426
and, bam, the... the hairs would stand up
on the back of your neck,

24:27.509 --> 24:30.057
and your heart would start pounding
as it all rushes back to you,

24:30.137 --> 24:32.557
everything you left behind.
Your jaw hangs open.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.099
The camera pushes in.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.392
Cue the music.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.451
- You remember "Jurassic Park"!
- What?

24:49.531 --> 24:52.201
You were just singing the theme song.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.584
Laura Dern, the brachiosaurus.

24:56.121 --> 24:59.211
I don't know "Jurassic Park."

24:59.291 --> 25:01.671
You remember the song.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.259
Manny...

25:06.339 --> 25:11.429
if you don't know "Jurassic Park,"
you don't know shit.

25:11.511 --> 25:15.769
This is from home,
where all the other people are.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.559
- Why is it out here now?
- Oh, it's trash.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.191
It's everything people don't want,
so we hide it.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.191
Why don't people want it anymore?

25:24.274 --> 25:26.694
Well, that's broken.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.236
That's empty.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.860
This is useless.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.656
Smelly. Old.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.950
How'd you get so far from home?

25:35.035 --> 25:38.535
I... I ran away, but that's...

25:38.622 --> 25:40.001
It doesn't matter. That's...

25:40.081 --> 25:44.751
What's important is you
remembering your life.

25:44.836 --> 25:48.126
Okay. What is life?

25:48.215 --> 25:49.925
Uh, okay.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.838
This is you.

25:51.927 --> 25:55.635
This is your body, and...
and that's where your brain is,

25:55.722 --> 25:57.932
and that's where you're going
to remember something.

25:58.016 --> 26:01.436
Humans have evolved over millions
and millions of years to be this way.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.271
- Yeah!
- We do all this stuff,

26:03.355 --> 26:06.855
because it helps us survive... kind of.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.192
What's that?

26:08.276 --> 26:11.236
That's poop.

26:11.321 --> 26:15.491
Poop is when your body
takes everything it doesn't want

26:15.575 --> 26:17.285
and squeezes it out of your butt.

26:17.369 --> 26:19.159
Everything poops. There's a book.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.792
Everybody reads about it
when they're a kid.

26:20.872 --> 26:23.252
People poop every day.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.423
Or extra when they're scared or sick

26:26.503 --> 26:30.260
or right when they die, because, uh,
you shit your pants when you die.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.090
- Oh, God.
- No, it's okay.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.045
People die every day.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.560
What do they do with all the dead people?

26:38.640 --> 26:41.060
- Do they hide them?
- Yeah.

26:41.142 --> 26:44.522
- So I'm like trash?
- No. You're different.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.274
Maybe you fell in radioactive waste,

26:46.356 --> 26:49.476
or maybe you were a special genetically
engineered soldier

26:49.609 --> 26:51.990
who was cryogenically frozen
and sent back in time to save me

26:52.070 --> 26:53.820
and save all of mankind.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.993
Oh, Super Manny, save me!

26:57.075 --> 26:58.785
You've got something in there.

26:58.868 --> 27:02.158
You're like the multipurpose tool guy.

27:02.247 --> 27:05.247
- You're special.
- I'm special?

27:05.333 --> 27:09.132
Yeah. And that's why I need you
to help me get home.

27:09.212 --> 27:13.382
Back in civilization, there's 7 billion
other living people on the planet

27:13.466 --> 27:17.716
just running around and blinking
and breathing and eating,

27:17.804 --> 27:19.514
and you used to be one of them.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.020
You were probably just looking for happiness.
That's what everyone does.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.563
This is what you look like
when you're happy.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.981
Happy.

27:25.061 --> 27:29.106
You look for someone who will make you
happy, a friend, a girlfriend, or a dog.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.320
- Ruff ruff. Good boy.
- Good boy.

27:31.401 --> 27:35.158
Sometimes you might be lucky enough
to bump into the one person

27:35.238 --> 27:36.948
you wanna spend the rest
of your life with,

27:37.032 --> 27:39.579
- and that is love.
- Okay.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.869
You want to go home so you can have love?

27:42.954 --> 27:44.251
Yeah.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.920
But you ran away 'cause nobody loves you?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.089
That's not true.

27:49.169 --> 27:54.005
You're broken and empty and dirty
and smelly and useless and old.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.840
- You're like trash, right?
- Shut up. What...

27:56.926 --> 27:59.716
I'm sorry, Hank.
I'm just saying the things in my head.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.394
Well, you can't just say
everything that comes into your head.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.434
That's bad talking.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.057
Oh. I'm sorry.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.815
Help!

28:14.819 --> 28:17.569
Can anybody hear me?

28:17.697 --> 28:19.277
I'm lost!

28:36.716 --> 28:39.296
What do I do now, Hank?

28:39.386 --> 28:42.966
Manny... just look at them.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.966
Imagine them without their clothes on.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.438
What's underneath their clothes?

28:47.519 --> 28:49.479
You know, their...

28:49.562 --> 28:53.192
boobs and vaginas, butts.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.824
Boobs, vaginas, and butts.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.994
- What do you do with those?
- Manny...

29:08.748 --> 29:11.328
You know, it used to be...

29:11.418 --> 29:15.918
really hard to come by a magazine like
that when I was a kid.

29:16.005 --> 29:19.295
I'd have to go digging
under the bushes by the freeway

29:19.384 --> 29:22.554
and sneak into my dad's stash.

29:22.637 --> 29:26.767
I mean, before the Internet,
every girl was a lot more special.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.858
I bet you probably did the same thing,

29:31.938 --> 29:35.728
make up little love stories
for each of them.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.777
What kind of love stories?

29:41.281 --> 29:42.531
Well...

29:42.615 --> 29:47.655
her name might have been... Jessie.

29:47.787 --> 29:51.327
And you'd imagine

29:51.416 --> 29:55.916
bumping into her on the street
and whisking her off her feet.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.884
Sign a one-year lease together.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.803
Cook dinner together.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.472
Watch Netflix.

30:02.552 --> 30:04.182
Ah.

30:04.262 --> 30:05.972
Hank, something's...

30:06.055 --> 30:09.555
something's going wrong with my boobs.

30:09.642 --> 30:10.892
What do you mean?

30:10.977 --> 30:13.857
They're going crazy.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.650
Holy shit.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.782
Ho... Oh, no. It's stopping.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.776
- Huh.
- Hey.

30:29.162 --> 30:32.210
What is Netflix?

30:32.290 --> 30:33.670
Shit. Uh, n...

30:35.168 --> 30:36.498
Well, that's...

30:36.586 --> 30:39.586
Normally when you go on a date
with a girl,

30:39.672 --> 30:42.929
you'd take her to the theater
to watch a movie,

30:43.009 --> 30:46.219
but when you're... when you're truly
comfortable with someone,

30:46.304 --> 30:48.351
you stay at home and watch Netflix.

30:48.431 --> 30:50.854
Like, you and Jessie would probably stay
at home together all the time,

30:50.934 --> 30:53.440
watching movies.
You'd... You'd fall asleep on the couch,

30:53.520 --> 30:56.609
unless you were throwing
one of your awesome parties.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.859
Then a few years later, you'd...
you'd get married.

30:58.942 --> 31:00.488
You'd have a... a small wedding,

31:00.568 --> 31:02.948
nothing big, and... and you'd have twins,

31:03.029 --> 31:06.161
and you'd have to get a second job to pay
the bills, but you wouldn't care, because...

31:06.241 --> 31:08.496
because you'd be going camping
all the time with your family, and...

31:08.576 --> 31:11.040
and you'd tell her she looks
even more beautiful with gray hairs.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.580
Manny.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.584
Manny, I think my love story
is bringing you back to life!

31:15.667 --> 31:17.457
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

31:17.544 --> 31:19.048
- It's moving!
- What's happening?

31:20.755 --> 31:22.045
- What is that?
- It's alive!

31:22.131 --> 31:24.179
- What is it?
- It's moving!

31:24.259 --> 31:26.179
Oh, God, I'm disgusting!

31:26.261 --> 31:28.011
No, no. No, no, no, you're not disgusting.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.266
No, my body is disgusting. It's horrible!

31:30.348 --> 31:33.271
No, it's okay. This happens to everybody.
This happens to everybody, it's normal.

31:33.351 --> 31:36.731
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah. Uh...

31:38.648 --> 31:39.898
It's okay. Calm down.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.733
Hey. Hey.

31:41.818 --> 31:43.068
Hey.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.200
Hey. Let's just...

31:45.280 --> 31:48.030
Let's just take this away for a second.

31:48.116 --> 31:51.196
Calm down. It's okay.

31:51.286 --> 31:52.536
Okay.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.632
Holy shit.

32:02.046 --> 32:03.296
Jessie.

32:59.687 --> 33:03.317
Manny, I think your penis
is guiding us home.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.399
Oh.

33:22.126 --> 33:25.456
Hey, nothing's happening, Hank.
You think I'm broken?

33:25.546 --> 33:27.466
Ah, that's okay.

33:27.548 --> 33:31.758
Look, sometimes when you do something
too many times,

33:31.844 --> 33:34.142
it has less of an effect.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.519
It's like the... the law
of diminishing returns.

33:36.599 --> 33:38.139
It happens to everyone.

33:38.226 --> 33:40.976
That's why there are so many fetishes
out there.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.860
- Fetishes?
- Yeah.

33:43.940 --> 33:48.360
See, everybody has
their own special tastes.

33:48.444 --> 33:52.869
Girls must be so nice if they let guys
do all those things to them.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.119
Yes, they are very nice.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.911
Remember when you put
that cork in my butt?

33:58.037 --> 33:59.247
Yeah.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.500
- Did that count as sex?
- Manny, no.

34:03.167 --> 34:04.957
I wanna have sex.

34:05.044 --> 34:08.301
I wish there was some way
I could pretend to do it.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.630
It's called masturbation.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.626
It's kinda like sex.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.178
- But by yourself?
- Yeah.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.681
Masturbating makes people happy?

34:16.764 --> 34:18.018
It's supposed to, sure.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.018
I bet you masturbate a lot.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.398
I can't believe we're talking about this.

34:22.478 --> 34:26.268
Manny, people aren't supposed to talk
about this stuff.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.610
Look, I just don't do it very much.

34:33.697 --> 34:37.328
The first time my dad caught me
looking at one of those magazines,

34:37.409 --> 34:39.199
he got really upset.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.746
Why?

34:40.830 --> 34:44.830
Well, I guess parents don't like knowing

34:44.917 --> 34:48.206
that their kids look
at that kind of stuff.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.206
That's why they tell them they'll...

34:50.297 --> 34:53.257
they'll go to hell or go blind.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.342
But my dad...

34:59.724 --> 35:03.439
He didn't believe in that stuff,
so my dad said,

35:03.519 --> 35:07.399
"Hank, uh, when you... you know,

35:07.482 --> 35:09.692
uh, it expends energy,

35:09.776 --> 35:12.646
both in the... in the orgasm

35:12.737 --> 35:14.447
and in the daily reproduction of sperm,

35:14.530 --> 35:18.990
so... so if you do it a lot, it adds up,
and it shortens your life span,

35:19.118 --> 35:21.998
and that's why, on average, males
have shorter life spans,

35:22.121 --> 35:24.961
because they... you know."

35:25.041 --> 35:27.630
So you were scared of death?

35:27.710 --> 35:32.760
Yeah. I... I was pretty upset.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.139
And then my mom saw that I was crying,

35:36.219 --> 35:39.389
and so she said this ridiculous thing.

35:39.472 --> 35:45.272
She said that she was 40 and I was 11 and,

35:45.353 --> 35:49.068
if I masturbated enough,
I could catch up to her

35:49.148 --> 35:54.068
and, that way, we could die on the exact
same day and never be apart.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.993
I think she was trying to be funny.

35:57.073 --> 35:58.953
Oh.

35:59.033 --> 36:00.283
Ah, it's not funny.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.328
Oh. Okay.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.831
She had a weird sense of humor.

36:03.913 --> 36:05.209
And even if she was right,

36:05.289 --> 36:09.499
I wouldn't have been able to jack off
fast enough to catch up.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.625
She died shortly after.

36:12.713 --> 36:16.884
And so now, when you masturbate,
you think about your mom.

36:16.968 --> 36:20.298
Ah, Manny, no. That's weird.

36:20.388 --> 36:23.348
Weird?

36:23.432 --> 36:27.732
Weird is like... when you do stuff
that nobody else does,

36:27.812 --> 36:29.062
so they make fun of you for it.

36:29.188 --> 36:32.438
So when I say that I can't masturbate

36:32.525 --> 36:34.985
because it makes me think about my mom,
people laugh at you.

36:35.069 --> 36:38.159
But that's fun.
Making people laugh is great.

36:38.239 --> 36:42.288
It's not, because they call you names
like Hanky Wanky,

36:42.368 --> 36:47.328
you have to change schools,
and it's... it's not fun.

36:47.415 --> 36:51.375
Hank, when I masturbate,
I'm gonna think about your mom.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.340
Manny, stop.

36:53.421 --> 36:56.091
But if I think about your mom
when I masturbate,

36:56.215 --> 36:59.385
- then you won't be weird anymore, right?
- No. Just quit talking.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.298
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, you're not,

37:01.387 --> 37:03.807
so stop talking and stop asking questions.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.348
Should I just go back to being dead?

37:07.435 --> 37:09.845
Yes, you should. Die in a fire.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.737
Manny, hey.

37:20.823 --> 37:23.203
Manny, I'm sorry I got upset.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.914
Focus. Are we going the right way?

37:27.079 --> 37:28.579
Manny.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.537
Buddy, I need you.

37:31.626 --> 37:34.836
I need you, your special compass.

37:39.717 --> 37:43.347
Okay.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.448
Holy...

37:59.528 --> 38:02.278
Something enormous took a dump here.

38:02.365 --> 38:03.695
We better be careful.

38:03.783 --> 38:05.163
Ohh!

38:06.786 --> 38:08.116
Careful.

38:23.511 --> 38:24.931
- Hey, Hank.
- Quiet.

38:25.012 --> 38:27.182
I thought you wanted me
to start talking again.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.686
I do. But right now,
I need you to be quiet.

38:28.766 --> 38:32.766
Well, I'm still not very good at
controlling the volume of my voice, Hank.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.108
- You have to teach me...
- Manny.

38:34.188 --> 38:37.108
What is your face doing?
Why are your eyes so big?

38:37.191 --> 38:40.571
Manny, this is what fear looks like.

38:40.653 --> 38:42.783
Why are you afraid of that poop?

38:42.863 --> 38:46.120
- I'm scared of whatever took that poop.
- But why, though?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.490
Because only huge, scary things
take poops that big.

38:48.577 --> 38:51.077
So what? Everything poops.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.213
Yes, but if it finds us, it will eat us

38:54.333 --> 38:57.882
and push us out its butt
and turn us into poop.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.091
Aah! Manny, run!

39:06.220 --> 39:08.100
Hank!

39:08.180 --> 39:10.890
Why are we moving so fast?

39:25.239 --> 39:26.779
What...

39:28.117 --> 39:29.537
Raah!

39:42.131 --> 39:43.381
Wow.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.759
Hank.

39:48.054 --> 39:49.724
What am I looking at?

39:51.515 --> 39:54.885
That's a... a phone.

39:54.977 --> 39:56.807
Phone is beautiful.

39:56.896 --> 40:01.396
No, no, no, no, no. That's just a picture
of a girl on a phone.

40:01.484 --> 40:05.449
What? Where'd it go? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

40:05.529 --> 40:08.414
- We should turn it off to save power.
- No. But it's mine.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.408
Manny...

40:12.453 --> 40:15.209
The phone is on low battery
with no signal.

40:15.289 --> 40:18.379
We've gotta turn it off so we can find
help once we're closer to home.

40:18.459 --> 40:22.709
I have a lot of questions
about all the things you just said.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.585
Just trust me.

40:26.675 --> 40:27.965
Hmm?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.600
Just trust me.

40:47.613 --> 40:48.863
Fuck.

41:05.089 --> 41:08.009
Can I look at her again?

41:19.645 --> 41:22.605
Can I see her again?

41:40.875 --> 41:42.785
Now can I see her?

41:44.003 --> 41:45.253
Please?

41:53.053 --> 41:55.059
Maybe...

41:55.639 --> 41:59.809
Maybe you could dress up, like before,

41:59.894 --> 42:02.774
so I could remember?

42:04.440 --> 42:06.150
Dress up?

42:06.233 --> 42:09.323
No, Manny, we need to find food.

42:09.403 --> 42:12.493
We need to get out of here,
or else I'm going to die.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.203
But we've tried all of those things.

42:15.284 --> 42:18.624
Hank, what if I knew her?

42:18.704 --> 42:21.752
Maybe she's my friend,

42:21.832 --> 42:26.382
or my girlfriend or my wife.

42:26.462 --> 42:30.592
It's like you said,
love is bringing me back to life.

42:30.674 --> 42:33.844
I'm your multipurpose tool guy.

42:35.846 --> 42:37.096
That sounds really...

42:49.360 --> 42:51.700
Stupid.

42:52.863 --> 42:56.453
Hurry, before you starve and die.

43:05.459 --> 43:08.419
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

43:08.504 --> 43:09.964
You look beautiful.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.720
You think I look beautiful?

43:13.801 --> 43:16.140
Of course I do.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.470
No, I... Really?

43:20.432 --> 43:21.682
Well, is it working?

43:21.767 --> 43:23.387
Are... Are you remembering anything?

43:23.477 --> 43:25.597
Uh...

43:25.688 --> 43:27.608
yeah.

43:30.276 --> 43:33.146
What's my name?

43:33.237 --> 43:36.907
Laura...

43:38.492 --> 43:40.831
- Dern?
- Manny!

43:40.911 --> 43:44.331
Oh, no! Hank, I'm so sorry.
Please, let me try again.

43:44.415 --> 43:46.170
Do you have any idea what people
back at home would think

43:46.250 --> 43:48.631
- if they saw me dressed like this?
- Oh, but let me try one more time.

43:48.711 --> 43:51.091
Hank, please.

43:52.631 --> 43:56.590
But now that I've seen her,
I can't get her out of my head,

43:56.677 --> 44:01.097
and I don't know if that's a thing
that happens or if I'm just weird,

44:01.181 --> 44:04.601
but something tells me she is the one
I'm supposed to bump into

44:04.685 --> 44:06.305
and spend the rest of my life with,

44:06.395 --> 44:09.265
and maybe if we can just find a way for me
to remember her,

44:09.356 --> 44:11.566
then, bam, it'll all come
rushing back to me,

44:11.650 --> 44:15.990
and the hairs on the back of my neck
will stand up, and I can save you.

44:20.409 --> 44:22.579
Wow. That talking was good.

44:22.661 --> 44:24.871
Yeah. See? It's working already.

44:24.955 --> 44:27.455
What are you doing?

44:27.541 --> 44:29.541
I'm singing a song
so you won't overthink things.

45:07.623 --> 45:08.923
Well?

45:09.917 --> 45:11.587
Uh...

45:11.710 --> 45:13.340
What should I do now?

45:15.631 --> 45:16.921
Um...

45:17.007 --> 45:18.507
okay, maybe you talk to her.

45:18.592 --> 45:20.180
What do I talk about?

45:20.260 --> 45:22.930
Just, you know, whatever comes naturally.

45:26.809 --> 45:28.349
Hello.

45:29.770 --> 45:31.650
I don't know why,

45:31.730 --> 45:36.610
but I have this sudden urge
to put my mouth on your mouth.

45:36.735 --> 45:39.105
Okay, that's called kissing,
but you can't do that yet.

45:39.196 --> 45:40.446
That's too fast.

45:40.531 --> 45:41.781
Oh. Uh...

45:41.865 --> 45:44.195
How 'bout if I put my penis in you?

45:44.284 --> 45:46.664
- That's even worse.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

45:46.745 --> 45:49.872
What about if I just did the tip,
like, just the very beginning...

45:49.957 --> 45:53.247
Okay, Manny, it's not about sex.
Okay? It's...

46:06.306 --> 46:08.386
Okay.

46:09.852 --> 46:11.899
Okay.

46:11.979 --> 46:13.229
Welcome to the bus.

46:13.313 --> 46:17.363
This is how people like us get places
if we're too poor to drive ourselves.

46:19.987 --> 46:21.447
Oh, yeah.

46:21.530 --> 46:23.070
There are other people.

46:23.157 --> 46:24.617
Yeah.

46:27.494 --> 46:29.874
Hello. Hello, everybody.

46:29.955 --> 46:32.535
Buses are for people
who don't know each other.

46:32.624 --> 46:34.630
They read books. They listen to music.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.507
- And we all sing songs together, right?
- No!

46:36.587 --> 46:38.467
No, no, no, the other people
will stare at you if you sing,

46:38.547 --> 46:40.087
so you listen to your own music.

46:40.174 --> 46:41.934
- Oh.
- Here.

46:43.886 --> 46:45.846
# If it hadn't been #

46:45.929 --> 46:50.229
# For Cotton Eye Joe #

46:50.309 --> 46:53.849
# I'd be married #

46:53.937 --> 46:56.897
# A long time ago... #

46:56.982 --> 46:59.071
As you listen...

46:59.151 --> 47:01.861
stare out the window.

47:01.945 --> 47:05.315
Oh. And I watch the world go by.

47:05.407 --> 47:09.037
# Wasn't for Cotton Eye #

47:09.119 --> 47:12.329
# Cotton Eye Joe... #

47:12.414 --> 47:15.212
So this is it.

47:15.292 --> 47:18.712
This is the life I've forgotten.

47:20.214 --> 47:22.761
Oh, when I get back home,

47:22.841 --> 47:27.221
I am gonna ride the bus every day.

47:27.304 --> 47:30.269
Manny, this is just the beginning.

47:30.349 --> 47:33.599
Every day, you ride the bus
and count the minutes,

47:33.685 --> 47:35.345
hoping you'll see her again.

47:39.566 --> 47:41.276
Oh, my God.

47:57.376 --> 48:00.416
She smiles,

48:00.504 --> 48:03.594
and you feel a strange tingle
up the back of your neck.

48:04.716 --> 48:09.046
Something carnal inside of you
causes your body to break out in sweats.

48:09.137 --> 48:12.467
You feel like the luckiest man
in the world.

48:12.558 --> 48:15.438
She sits alone, just like every other day,

48:15.519 --> 48:17.399
and looks out the window
lost in her thoughts.

48:17.479 --> 48:21.019
You know that look.
She's just as alone as you are.

48:21.108 --> 48:25.318
But she doesn't have to be.
You could talk to her.

48:25.404 --> 48:30.120
Tell her you'd love to sit next to her
today and every other day,

48:30.200 --> 48:34.249
because life is short, and no one deserves
to ride the bus alone.

48:34.329 --> 48:35.869
I want this to stop.

48:35.956 --> 48:37.496
- It's not working?
- No.

48:37.583 --> 48:38.962
She's too beautiful.

48:39.042 --> 48:41.298
I can't talk to her now.

48:41.378 --> 48:43.758
What if I say something stupid?
I'll just wanna die.

48:43.839 --> 48:47.429
She's right there.
You're not gonna do anything?

48:48.677 --> 48:51.177
What would you do?

48:51.263 --> 48:53.273
I would...

48:54.766 --> 48:58.186
I would probably wait,

48:58.270 --> 49:01.440
and watch her get off the bus

49:01.523 --> 49:05.693
and go home and eat
a whole box of pizza by myself.

49:08.447 --> 49:12.027
Manny, I should tell you the truth.
I'm not really good at this stuff.

49:13.118 --> 49:15.618
Oh, right. Nobody loves you.

49:29.551 --> 49:31.011
Try these on.

49:32.012 --> 49:33.762
My eyeballs can't see as well.

49:33.847 --> 49:36.637
But you look mysterious,
and girls like mysterious.

49:36.725 --> 49:39.435
- You feel cool, right?
- I guess.

49:39.519 --> 49:42.439
- You look cool.
- Oh! What are you doing?

49:42.522 --> 49:44.319
All you have to do is talk to her.

49:44.399 --> 49:45.979
- I believe in you.
- Whoa!

50:01.500 --> 50:03.460
Are you sitting alone?

50:04.878 --> 50:08.088
- Yeah.
- So you're a freak.

50:08.173 --> 50:09.843
What?

50:11.593 --> 50:13.223
Now you're not.

50:15.472 --> 50:17.392
So what are you listening to?

50:17.474 --> 50:19.734
It's a song I wrote for you.

50:35.367 --> 50:37.657
- Hank?
- Hmm?

50:37.744 --> 50:40.254
Pick up my hand.

50:41.581 --> 50:44.041
Okay, now put it on her hand.

50:51.466 --> 50:54.386
Okay. I wanna look at her.

50:59.891 --> 51:01.771
My name is Manny.

51:04.896 --> 51:06.646
My name is S...

51:08.942 --> 51:11.112
Sarah.

51:11.194 --> 51:12.532
Sarah.

51:12.612 --> 51:14.362
That's her name?

51:14.448 --> 51:16.028
Sarah Johnson.

51:16.116 --> 51:18.536
- Sarah Johnson?
- Yeah, Sarah Johnson.

51:20.320 --> 51:21.580
Manny, your face.

51:21.663 --> 51:23.833
Oh, this is what
I look like when I'm happy.

51:23.915 --> 51:26.075
We have to get home, Hank.

51:26.168 --> 51:28.798
We have to get home, so I can find Sarah

51:28.879 --> 51:30.509
and have twins with her and work two jobs

51:30.589 --> 51:31.919
- and grow old.
- Manny, my hand.

51:39.681 --> 51:41.561
Manny, help me get home.

51:50.734 --> 51:53.198
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

51:53.278 --> 51:55.568
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

51:55.655 --> 51:57.775
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

51:57.866 --> 51:59.826
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

51:59.910 --> 52:02.540
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

52:02.621 --> 52:04.918
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

52:04.998 --> 52:07.248
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

52:07.334 --> 52:09.339
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

52:25.560 --> 52:26.940
Wow.

52:27.938 --> 52:30.478
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:30.565 --> 52:32.605
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:32.692 --> 52:35.072
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:35.153 --> 52:37.242
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:37.322 --> 52:39.369
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:39.449 --> 52:41.829
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:41.910 --> 52:43.999
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

52:44.079 --> 52:46.919
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

53:00.345 --> 53:02.135
# Now we killed a raccoon #

53:02.222 --> 53:04.311
# We are using your body
like it's a machine gun #

53:04.391 --> 53:06.521
# Now we are shooting some fish #

53:06.601 --> 53:07.851
# Our friendship is blossoming #

53:07.936 --> 53:09.766
# Let's eat the stuff we killed #

53:09.855 --> 53:11.765
# Now we started a fire #

53:11.857 --> 53:13.977
# I have to admit
I'm enjoying your company #

53:14.067 --> 53:18.907
# Are we falling in love? #

53:18.989 --> 53:21.989
# All we ever needed

53:22.075 --> 53:28.075
# Is a montage #

53:31.293 --> 53:33.093
Oh.

53:35.255 --> 53:36.795
What was that?

53:45.056 --> 53:49.016
# True #

53:49.102 --> 53:54.152
# Friendship #

54:13.293 --> 54:14.543
Vodka.

54:15.921 --> 54:17.171
Let's have a party.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.465
Yeah. Let's invite everyone we know.

54:19.549 --> 54:24.049
Everyone! We're having a party!

54:55.001 --> 54:57.501
Manny, I need to tell you
something. You...

54:57.587 --> 54:59.207
Whoo! Whoa!

55:00.632 --> 55:02.842
Little tipsy.

55:02.926 --> 55:04.966
Whoa.

55:07.305 --> 55:08.965
Sarah...

55:11.851 --> 55:14.441
I think you're the one.

55:15.689 --> 55:18.609
I've never been happier.

55:19.985 --> 55:22.815
Manny... look at me.

55:28.576 --> 55:31.616
The more you're gonna see of me,
the more you're not gonna like me.

55:33.039 --> 55:34.709
It's diminishing returns and whatever.

55:36.876 --> 55:41.296
- Sarah, do you ever masturbate?
- What?

55:41.381 --> 55:43.011
I have this friend called Hank

55:43.091 --> 55:46.931
and he won't masturbate,
'cause it makes him think about his mom.

55:47.012 --> 55:51.392
Manny, that... that was between us.

55:51.474 --> 55:54.274
No, listen. Sarah...

55:56.146 --> 55:57.766
Sarah.

56:05.947 --> 56:10.947
So, Hank's mom died
when he was very, very little,

56:11.036 --> 56:15.246
and so it makes him upset
to think about her.

56:15.373 --> 56:18.793
And so even though masturbation
makes him happy,

56:18.877 --> 56:21.457
he won't do it.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.006
Okay.

56:23.089 --> 56:28.679
I don't know exactly what masturbation is
or how it works,

56:28.762 --> 56:35.230
but I guess it probably feels
a lot like the wind in your hair

56:35.310 --> 56:38.730
or driving really fast in a car

56:38.813 --> 56:42.193
or taking a bite out of your favorite food

56:42.275 --> 56:45.065
or dancing with your friends

56:45.153 --> 56:47.863
or singing your favorite song

56:47.947 --> 56:49.947
or riding the bus

56:50.033 --> 56:52.293
or looking out of windows.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.830
Now, why would you ever say no to that?

56:55.914 --> 57:00.464
I just think his mom would want him
to be happy.

57:01.544 --> 57:03.133
Don't you?

57:03.213 --> 57:06.173
Yeah. I think so.

57:06.257 --> 57:11.177
And what would make you happy right now?

57:16.101 --> 57:17.441
Maybe...

57:24.275 --> 57:27.605
- I'm really drunk.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

57:30.615 --> 57:33.945
- We should go to bed.
- Yeah.

57:35.495 --> 57:40.535
Uh, Hank, will you just take my head
out of the window?

57:44.754 --> 57:46.514
Thank you.

57:49.926 --> 57:51.506
Sleep well.

58:10.363 --> 58:12.823
Morning, Hank.

58:12.907 --> 58:14.527
How'd you sleep?

58:22.375 --> 58:23.835
It's late.

58:23.918 --> 58:25.918
Better get a move on.

59:01.080 --> 59:03.290
Hank, thanks to you,

59:03.374 --> 59:07.384
I'm gonna get to see her soon... for real.

59:31.069 --> 59:35.819
I have this feeling,
and I don't know what to call it.

59:39.953 --> 59:43.373
It's like I feel like even though
I'm on top of you right now,

59:43.456 --> 59:48.089
touching you physically,
there's something stuck in between us.

59:48.169 --> 59:49.419
Whoa!

59:51.965 --> 59:54.795
I also feel like
you have something to say,

59:54.884 --> 01:00:00.006
but you don't know what to say,
and so neither of us is saying anything,

01:00:00.098 --> 01:00:02.638
and for some reason,
I feel like this might go on forever.

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:04.935
- Is that a thing?
- No, it's not a thing.

01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:07.809
So no one's ever felt this way before?

01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:12.817
You might be the first one ever
in the history of mankind.

01:00:12.902 --> 01:00:15.241
Oh.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:18.451
That has just made me
have another feeling, and I...

01:00:18.533 --> 01:00:20.622
Manny, please, no more feelings right now.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.537
Oh, wow.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.667
Oh, wow.

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:35.470
Oh, Hank, I think...
I think I'm feeling fear.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.800
Not now, Manny.

01:00:36.884 --> 01:00:38.344
No, really, I'm scared.

01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:43.058
I'm scared, 'cause I think if I die,
I might really miss you.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.020
Oh, you're the worst.

01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:20.655
# Heartless #

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:26.038
# How were you heartless? #

01:02:26.119 --> 01:02:31.459
# I saw your sadness #

01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:37.961
# And made it my own #

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:41.215
# Crazy # # Tell me if you don't mind #

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.430
# The immediate wonder,
the fatal attraction #

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:47.518
# Totally crazy #
# Told you to run like the wind #

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.348
# We've gotta depend on each other #

01:02:49.434 --> 01:02:53.483
- # We're fucking crazy #
- # I want to climb in your brain #

01:02:53.563 --> 01:02:55.401
# Devour the webbing,
and know your opinions #

01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:59.071
- # We won't ever stop #
- # But you're still afraid of the shame #

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:01.902
# I promise I'll fix it,
it's all for a reason #

01:03:01.988 --> 01:03:04.408
# You just have to remember #

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:07.030
# That we're all here for a purpose #

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:10.458
# And the universe picks its time #

01:03:10.538 --> 01:03:13.538
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything #

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:16.464
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything #

01:03:16.544 --> 01:03:19.133
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything... #

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:24.053
Are you excited to see everyone
when you get home?

01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:26.215
Yeah, I guess.

01:03:26.304 --> 01:03:28.474
You'll be able to see your dad.

01:03:28.556 --> 01:03:31.136
Yeah, he's probably been
wondering where you are.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:34.475
Well, we haven't really kept up.

01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:38.152
I mean, we tried the whole calling
each other on our birthdays thing,

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:41.572
but, you know, that eventually went away.

01:03:41.652 --> 01:03:43.152
Why? What happened?

01:03:44.447 --> 01:03:48.117
Well, a few years back, he forgot to call.

01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:53.209
He didn't really know how to say
sorry, but I could tell he felt bad,

01:03:53.289 --> 01:03:57.338
so I taught him how to set up
an automated birthday e-card.

01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:59.878
That's like a letter
you get on your phone.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:02.552
It automatically sends me
a birthday card every year,

01:04:02.632 --> 01:04:04.552
so that way, he'll never forget.

01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:09.223
I mean, I always forgot his as well,
so I set one up, too.

01:04:09.305 --> 01:04:12.925
Wow. I wonder if my dad
and I did that, too.

01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:15.977
I hope I sent him
an automated card every day.

01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:18.151
It's nothing special.

01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:19.691
If I died out here,

01:04:19.774 --> 01:04:23.614
some website would send him a birthday
card every year for the rest of his life.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:25.864
He probably wouldn't even know I was gone.

01:04:25.947 --> 01:04:27.697
Well, that's not true. He cares about you.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:29.032
Yeah.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.451
Yeah, he's my dad.

01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:33.906
But he just doesn't...

01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:36.826
I mean, he ought to show it sometimes.

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:39.246
Why wouldn't he want to show that?

01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:44.802
Neither of us were good at talking.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:48.681
Sometimes it's hard for people
to show how they feel.

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:50.558
That's retarded.

01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:53.218
- Manny, don't use that word.
- When I get back home,

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:57.187
I'm gonna show Sarah how much I care
about her every single day.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.359
Whenever she wants, she's thirsty
or whatever, she can drink my spit,

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:03.689
and then she can ride my gas
to wherever she wants to go.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:06.276
You can't use your gas in front
of other people.

01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:08.032
What? Why not?

01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:10.369
Because it's weird.

01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:12.699
People don't like other people's farts.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.120
Is that why you don't fart in front of me?

01:05:17.206 --> 01:05:19.126
No. I just...

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:23.088
like to do it alone or hold it in.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.090
That's what you're supposed to do.

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:27.132
That's so sad.

01:05:28.384 --> 01:05:30.304
That's so sad!

01:05:30.386 --> 01:05:32.846
What are we even going back home for?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:36.229
It sounds like you're not allowed to do
anything back there.

01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:38.809
Yeah.

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:42.476
Maybe we should just stay out here.

01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:44.395
And never go home?

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.949
This'll be our home.

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:51.779
We could make our own rules
and do whatever we want to.

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.486
Ah, we could start a band.

01:05:53.576 --> 01:05:56.036
And we could build a house in the trees.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.330
Yeah, with a home movie theater system.

01:05:58.414 --> 01:05:59.752
And a recording studio.

01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:01.629
Yeah, we could sing songs
as loud as we want.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:03.339
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:06:03.419 --> 01:06:04.749
Yeah.

01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:07.547
- Yeah, you and me.
- Yeah. Heh.

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:16.967
I have to pee.

01:06:50.675 --> 01:06:53.835
# I'm sitting on this rock #

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:56.678
# Such a comfy rock #

01:06:56.764 --> 01:07:01.564
# Hank's gone to pee #

01:07:01.644 --> 01:07:04.609
# It is so nice here #

01:07:04.689 --> 01:07:07.689
# Nice and dark and warm #

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:09.685
# Hank's gone... #

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:52.489
Manny, I have something
amazing to show you,

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.075
but I need to tell you something first.

01:07:54.155 --> 01:07:55.865
Hank, I have something to say to you, too.

01:07:55.948 --> 01:07:57.448
No, I need to go first.

01:07:57.533 --> 01:08:00.748
Look... I needed you to help me get home,

01:08:00.828 --> 01:08:04.578
and then one thing led to another,
and then suddenly I had a friend,

01:08:04.665 --> 01:08:07.455
and I was too scared
to tell you the truth,

01:08:07.543 --> 01:08:11.258
but this is my phone, Manny, not yours.

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:13.508
And Sarah...

01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:17.341
is a girl I saw on the bus every day,

01:08:17.428 --> 01:08:19.678
but I never had the courage
to even talk to her.

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:23.020
I didn't think someone like her
would ever wanna be with me.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.189
I didn't even wanna be with me.

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:26.519
Eventually...

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:27.984
What?

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.777
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to tell you, Hank.

01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:31.569
There's a giant raccoon,
and it's eating our food.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:32.689
Shh.

01:08:40.493 --> 01:08:43.412
What were you saying about Sarah?

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:51.804
Sarah.

01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:55.548
Manny.

01:08:55.633 --> 01:08:58.723
Manny. Manny!

01:08:59.929 --> 01:09:01.559
Down.

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:06.058
What was Sarah doing with that guy?

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:08.523
That's her real life.
Can we talk about it later?

01:09:10.356 --> 01:09:12.475
She was never even mine?

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.236
Why didn't you tell me?

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:16.568
I wanted to.

01:09:16.654 --> 01:09:18.113
I was too embarrassed.

01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:22.411
Embarrassed?

01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:25.872
You made me think I was in love
with someone

01:09:25.955 --> 01:09:27.865
who never even knew I existed,

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:31.497
but I'm just a lonely,
loser weirdo, really?

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:34.206
We don't need her anymore!

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:40.760
We got each other!

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.180
Shit, shit, shit.

01:09:51.063 --> 01:09:52.443
Wow.

01:09:58.279 --> 01:09:59.529
Oof!

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.287
Look.

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:15.461
Hey!

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:18.006
Hey! Look over here! Please help us!

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.470
What is this?

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:21.138
Those are cars, Manny.
If we can get down...

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.138
I know those are fucking cars.
I'm talking about life.

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:27.266
What is life?

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:29.769
Manny...

01:10:29.852 --> 01:10:32.562
what is that flashing in my head? It...

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:35.106
Are you crying?

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.490
I don't know. Is this crying?

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:41.860
I don't like it.

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:45.117
It's wet and uncomfortable,

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:48.249
and, oh, God, why am I shaking now?

01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:50.539
Just breathe. This is normal.

01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:53.503
Just try to think about happy thoughts.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:55.422
I'm...

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:58.632
Manny, whatever
you are doing, please stop.

01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:00.634
I'm... I'm just thinking.

01:11:00.716 --> 01:11:03.006
- Well, stop thinking.
- I can't help it.

01:11:04.053 --> 01:11:08.352
This is a thought, and this is a thought,

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:09.979
and this is a thought,

01:11:10.059 --> 01:11:13.439
thought, thought, thought.

01:11:14.647 --> 01:11:16.647
These are all thoughts,

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:20.030
and sometimes thoughts
become other thoughts.

01:11:23.656 --> 01:11:26.736
Thoughts like, if my best friend
keeps his farts from me...

01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:36.673
...what else is he hiding from me?

01:11:40.798 --> 01:11:44.008
And why does that thought
make me feel so alone?

01:11:44.093 --> 01:11:46.973
Manny, we have to try to think
about something else.

01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:49.560
It's not healthy to fixate
on these things.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.140
I just had a thought about a thought.

01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:57.816
How do you hide your thoughts,
and why do we have to hide everything?

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:04.241
Manny, this is just another power
your body has.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.821
You can learn to control it.

01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:08.446
So I guess my brain is just weird, too?

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:13.247
What do you do with thoughts like this?

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.870
I used to lie there.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:20.165
I used to be empty,
and then you came along.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.918
And I don't want this anymore.

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:28.797
Manny, please. I'm going to die.

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:32.807
We're gonna die. That's a thought.

01:12:32.891 --> 01:12:35.561
Everybody dies.

01:12:35.644 --> 01:12:40.194
I'm sorry if this makes me weird
or you don't understand,

01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:42.484
but I wish I was dead again.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:44.777
No, Manny.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:51.201
I understand.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:18.190
So I guess you're gonna die now.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.980
It really feels like it's my fault.

01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:23.395
No, Manny. It's not your fault.

01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:26.154
I probably would have
done it myself eventually.

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:30.866
God knows I've tried,
but there was always something there,

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:36.409
some thought that was beautiful enough
to keep me going.

01:13:36.497 --> 01:13:40.127
Maybe that's just something the brain
invents to survive.

01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:44.589
Yeah. Like maybe your brain invented me
to distract you from the fact

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.171
that eventually your eyes
are gonna stop blinking

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:51.507
and your mouth will stop chewing
and your blood will stop pumping...

01:13:51.595 --> 01:13:53.755
and then you're gonna shit yourself.

01:13:53.847 --> 01:13:56.517
- And that's it.
- No.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.020
No, that's not it.

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:02.523
Because then my organs are
going to shit themselves.

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.436
And then your cells will shit themselves,

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:08.145
and then all your shit's gonna get mixed
in with everyone else's shit

01:14:08.237 --> 01:14:11.657
till there's nothing left of you,
and then that's it.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.030
I don't know, man.

01:14:13.117 --> 01:14:17.290
That sounds kind of nice,
everyone's shit mixing,

01:14:17.371 --> 01:14:19.621
because then someday some of your shit

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:23.746
is gonna meet up with some of my shit,

01:14:23.836 --> 01:14:27.086
and we'll have something
to look forward to, you know?

01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:29.342
You're disgusting.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.210
Manny.

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:17.066
Manny, you idiot.

01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:19.077
You dumb idiot.

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:27.421
Oh, you look like shit.

01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:31.341
Ah, yeah. Yeah. So do you.

01:16:32.965 --> 01:16:35.045
Thank you.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:36.593
Hey...

01:16:36.677 --> 01:16:38.097
Hank.

01:16:38.178 --> 01:16:40.508
Hank.

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:05.292
Wow. There she is.

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:16.091
Oh, shit.

01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:18.972
No, Manny, shh! Manny, stop singing!

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:21.182
- Manny! No!
- Hank, what are you doing?

01:17:21.263 --> 01:17:22.601
- This is home.
- No!

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.353
This is what we've been
fighting for, right?

01:17:24.433 --> 01:17:26.813
No! No. Oh, come on...

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:28.982
- Manny, this is a bad idea!
- No, it's a great idea.

01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:32.822
Manny, let go of me!

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.821
Maybe you could finally talk to her, Hank.

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:40.243
You can finally show her all the things
we built for her and sing her the songs...

01:17:40.324 --> 01:17:43.038
Manny! Shut up! You don't
know the real world, Manny.

01:17:43.118 --> 01:17:44.957
What if they meet you and
they don't see what I see?

01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:46.617
What if they don't...

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:48.825
That's stupid.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:58.929
From the first day we met,
you've been pushing me and poking me,

01:17:59.009 --> 01:18:01.259
making me spit, making me cry.

01:18:01.345 --> 01:18:03.055
Manny!

01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:05.468
How come I never get to see you do
any of those things?

01:18:05.557 --> 01:18:06.807
Because I'm scared.

01:18:06.892 --> 01:18:08.562
Okay?

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:13.265
Because I'm just a scared,
ugly, useless person.

01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:18.069
But maybe everyone's a little bit ugly.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:21.410
Yeah, maybe we're all just ugly,
dying sacks of shit,

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:25.038
and maybe all it'll take is one person
to just be okay with that,

01:18:25.118 --> 01:18:28.958
and then the whole world
will be dancing and singing and farting,

01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:32.379
and everyone will feel
a little bit less alone.

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:35.339
Manny, you have no idea
how nice that sounds.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.710
Hello.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.521
Are you dressed up for Halloween?

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:51.398
No. Uh...

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:55.108
No, we're just a little dirty and tired.

01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:57.279
What's wrong with your face?

01:18:57.359 --> 01:19:00.239
Nothing. We just need some help.

01:19:03.031 --> 01:19:07.080
My name's Manny,
and this is my best friend Hank.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.500
I used to be dead,
but then he brought me back to life,

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.080
and we were lost out there in the woods
for a very long time,

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:17.127
but we survived, because I have
special powers.

01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:19.422
Manny.

01:19:22.175 --> 01:19:24.215
Manny.

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:25.972
- That's gross.
- No.

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:28.854
No, it's not gross.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:35.981
God, no.

01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:37.361
Don't be afraid.

01:19:37.441 --> 01:19:38.904
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

01:19:38.984 --> 01:19:41.614
I'm scary, Hank. I guess I was wrong.

01:19:41.695 --> 01:19:43.235
I am weird.

01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:46.201
Manny, don't say that.
She just doesn't understand.

01:19:46.283 --> 01:19:48.493
Crissie?

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:53.038
What is it?

01:20:00.172 --> 01:20:02.232
Crissie?

01:20:02.716 --> 01:20:03.966
Crissie, get inside.

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.430
Who are you?
What are you doing in my backyard?

01:20:14.436 --> 01:20:17.396
He's Manny. He used to be dead.

01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:19.861
Crissie, let Mommy talk, okay?

01:20:19.941 --> 01:20:22.030
He was lost in the woods. He needs help.

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:23.360
What?

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.531
Is that true?

01:20:29.493 --> 01:20:31.663
You okay?

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:42.259
Just wait here.

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:53.388
Hey. Hey.

01:20:53.475 --> 01:20:56.015
See that? That wasn't so bad.

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:59.109
Did you see the way she looked at me?

01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:00.819
I'm not very good at this.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:05.529
No. No, hey, bud,
you're the best at this. Okay?

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:07.162
I'm sorry, Hank.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:12.371
Hey, Manny. Manny, don't be stupid.

01:21:12.452 --> 01:21:17.292
Please don't tell Sarah
how much I loved her.

01:21:19.084 --> 01:21:20.344
Manny.

01:21:21.419 --> 01:21:23.549
Manny.

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.050
Hey.

01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:27.429
Hey. Manny.

01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:30.679
Manny. Manny.

01:21:30.762 --> 01:21:32.892
Manny.

01:21:32.973 --> 01:21:36.183
Here. Come sit down, okay?

01:21:36.268 --> 01:21:37.558
I called for help.

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:43.443
Come on.

01:22:14.556 --> 01:22:16.886
This is some fucked-up shit.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:19.345
You really think he just found the body?

01:22:19.436 --> 01:22:21.726
The abrasions seem to have
happened postmortem,

01:22:21.813 --> 01:22:27.489
and discoloration on the abdomen
tells me he's probably a bridge jumper.

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:29.783
We find their bodies washed up
on the beach all the time.

01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:32.493
That must be where he found him,
so actually checks out.

01:22:32.574 --> 01:22:34.329
What do they do with him now?

01:22:34.409 --> 01:22:35.747
He'll spend two weeks in the morgue

01:22:35.827 --> 01:22:37.947
while they try to figure out
who the hell he is,

01:22:38.038 --> 01:22:40.958
and when nobody comes to claim
the body, because nobody ever does,

01:22:41.041 --> 01:22:43.129
the county can pay for a funeral
no one'll show up to,

01:22:43.209 --> 01:22:45.757
because obviously no one cared
about this son of a bitch to begin with.

01:22:45.837 --> 01:22:47.877
Hey.

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:49.634
Yeah?

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:50.971
- Don't I know you?
- Hey.

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:52.841
- Manny, there you are.
- You look familiar.

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:55.259
Are you ready? We are going live
in five minutes.

01:22:55.347 --> 01:22:57.887
Right this way. Turn around.
Right this way.

01:22:57.974 --> 01:22:59.229
It's all so exciting, isn't it?

01:22:59.309 --> 01:23:01.606
- They're gonna love your story.
- Find anything on the cell phone?

01:23:01.686 --> 01:23:03.226
They're checking it out right now.

01:23:03.313 --> 01:23:06.152
- There she is.
- That's the phone?

01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:08.072
Stand right here. Don't go anywhere.

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:17.122
It's all right.

01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:19.249
- You the father?
- Yes.

01:23:19.329 --> 01:23:22.617
We found your number in this phone,
and there's no I.D. on the body,

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:25.417
so we just need somebody
to identify the body.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.967
Ready?

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:39.095
No. No.

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:40.642
I'm sorry.

01:24:12.674 --> 01:24:15.844
I just wanted to check in, make sure
you're okay. You all right?

01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:17.887
This must all be really
overwhelming for you,

01:24:17.971 --> 01:24:21.019
so just let me know if you need
anything, okay?

01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:23.688
Excuse me. Ma'am, I have something
I need to show you.

01:24:23.768 --> 01:24:25.518
Can you come with me?

01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:27.273
Good luck on your interview.

01:24:27.355 --> 01:24:31.525
So they found this phone on the body,
and there are these images.

01:24:31.609 --> 01:24:33.569
Manny? Manny, there you are.

01:24:33.653 --> 01:24:34.903
- Do you know...
- This is...

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.451
We're going live in just a few seconds.

01:24:36.531 --> 01:24:37.951
- Right this way.
- Keep swiping.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:39.454
And turn around. Here's the camera.

01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:40.954
Do not go anywhere.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:43.457
- You don't know this young man?
- No, I don't.

01:24:43.538 --> 01:24:45.618
Look right into it.
Your friends are gonna see you.

01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:49.087
Five, four, three, two...

01:24:50.628 --> 01:24:54.052
Thanks, Jonathan. We're here live with
the man who we know simply as Manny...

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.680
- Hey! What are you doing, son?
- ...a man who stumbled into the backyard

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.470
- of a local Eastborough home...
- I'm not Manny.

01:24:59.554 --> 01:25:00.814
And your name?

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:05.480
- My name is Hank Thompson.
- We're here with Hank Thompson...

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.649
And that's Manny.

01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:12.984
He saved my life with his amazing body,
and he has these powers,

01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:16.989
and they're the only reason
that I'm standing here today,

01:25:17.113 --> 01:25:19.703
- and I will not let them take him away.
- Okay.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.370
Wait. What's going on?

01:25:24.454 --> 01:25:27.124
This is... This is your phone?
Why... Why am I in your phone?

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:28.827
I'm sorry.

01:25:28.917 --> 01:25:33.457
You just seemed really happy,
and I wasn't.

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:35.716
What the fuck?

01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:37.049
Hey, buddy.

01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:39.639
Hank, what are you trying to do to me?
What would your mother think?

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:41.639
I think she'd be happy somebody loves me.

01:25:41.721 --> 01:25:44.221
Hank. Hank! That's a dead body.

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:48.437
- What are you, retarded?
- Dad, don't say that word.

01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:57.859
No! Manny!

01:25:57.946 --> 01:25:59.776
Manny, where are you?

01:26:00.824 --> 01:26:02.871
Crissie? Crissie!

01:26:02.951 --> 01:26:04.491
Crissie!

01:26:06.037 --> 01:26:07.997
- Sorry, bud.
- Sir!

01:26:10.458 --> 01:26:12.088
Sir! Stop!

01:26:12.168 --> 01:26:13.668
- Hank!
- Crissie!

01:26:13.753 --> 01:26:15.633
Crissie, come out right now!

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.013
Sir, where are you going?

01:26:20.093 --> 01:26:21.433
I got you.

01:26:23.096 --> 01:26:25.096
Come on. Stay with me.

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:27.228
I won't let them take you away.

01:26:27.308 --> 01:26:32.650
I won't let them take you to some morgue
and bury you in some unmarked grave.

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:35.940
Please, I just need you to wake up!

01:26:36.943 --> 01:26:38.193
Hank!

01:26:38.278 --> 01:26:40.698
- Crissie!
- Crissie!

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.070
Hank, where are you?

01:26:44.659 --> 01:26:47.289
Sir, stop!

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.750
Sir, you've gotta get out of the river.

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:54.502
What is this?

01:26:58.798 --> 01:27:01.218
Oh, fuck. They're gonna see everything.

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.509
Crissie!

01:27:39.047 --> 01:27:41.417
I really screwed you up, didn't I?

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.837
I'm sorry.

01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:48.809
I just wanted to give you all the things
in life that everyone else gets to have

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:54.060
and all the things I thought
I didn't deserve to have till I met you.

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.771
And they might laugh at us.

01:27:57.857 --> 01:28:00.067
They might call us names,

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:04.111
and they might think we're weird,
but it doesn't matter what they think.

01:28:04.197 --> 01:28:06.867
Just please...

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.910
don't die.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.156
Hey.

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.381
You made all that?

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:21.127
Yes.

01:28:23.174 --> 01:28:24.971
Yes.

01:28:25.051 --> 01:28:26.721
We did it...

01:28:26.803 --> 01:28:28.183
together.

01:28:29.222 --> 01:28:31.682
And we sang, and we danced...

01:28:31.766 --> 01:28:33.016
Oh, my God.

01:28:33.101 --> 01:28:35.021
...and it was beautiful.

01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.978
I wish you all could have been there.

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:43.069
I wish you all could have seen it.

01:28:45.822 --> 01:28:48.202
We just have to show them.

01:29:12.849 --> 01:29:14.179
What the fuck?

01:29:15.977 --> 01:29:17.227
Wait.

01:29:17.353 --> 01:29:19.403
Oh, Jesus.

01:29:26.738 --> 01:29:28.568
It was me.

01:29:30.283 --> 01:29:31.533
I did it.

01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:41.248
All right, let's go.

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:43.297
Manny.

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:44.839
Come on.

01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:50.049
Manny.

01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:02.606
Come on.

01:30:04.317 --> 01:30:06.397
All right, man, that's enough, okay?

01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:08.906
- That wasn't me.
- What?

01:31:23.271 --> 01:31:25.151
What the fuck?

01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:04.476
# Restless #

01:32:04.562 --> 01:32:10.112
# Walking 'round restless #

01:32:10.193 --> 01:32:15.363
# It's such a good night, man #

01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:19.198
# For being alone #

01:32:22.538 --> 01:32:25.708
# Interest #

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:31.921
# Nothing but interest #

01:32:32.006 --> 01:32:36.006
# I think I lost it #

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:40.846
# Forever ago #

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:46.306
# Is there any way #

01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:49.855
# To get out of here? #

01:32:49.941 --> 01:32:53.401
# Out there #

01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:58.736
# Further than distance #

01:32:58.824 --> 01:33:04.124
# There is an instance #

01:33:04.205 --> 01:33:08.035
# Searching for home #

01:33:11.045 --> 01:33:14.755
# I'll try #

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.220
# Try to believe it #

01:33:20.221 --> 01:33:25.521
# Try to conceive it #

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:29.611
# By using your bone #

01:33:31.816 --> 01:33:38.486
# There's gotta be a way
to get out of here #

# Restless #

01:33:41.826 --> 01:33:46.286
# How are you breathless? #

01:33:47.373 --> 01:33:52.548
# Tired, but restless #

01:33:52.628 --> 01:33:56.418
# The lacking of tone #

01:33:59.427 --> 01:34:03.217
# Heartless #

01:34:03.306 --> 01:34:07.726
# How were you heartless? #

01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:13.861
# I see your sadness #

01:34:13.941 --> 01:34:17.651
# And make it my own #

01:34:20.156 --> 01:34:22.986
# There's gotta be a better way #

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:27.245
# To get out of here. #

01:35:31.352 --> 01:35:35.232
# Where did you come from? #

01:35:35.314 --> 01:35:36.902
# Where did you go? #

01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:38.652
# Where did you go? #

01:35:38.734 --> 01:35:41.282
# Where did you come from? #

01:35:41.362 --> 01:35:44.282
# Where did you go? #

01:35:44.365 --> 01:35:47.655

01:35:47.743 --> 01:35:50.413
# Where did you go? #

01:35:50.496 --> 01:35:53.996

01:35:54.083 --> 01:35:57.003
# Where did you go? #

01:35:57.086 --> 01:36:00.126
# Where did you come from? #

01:36:00.214 --> 01:36:01.924
