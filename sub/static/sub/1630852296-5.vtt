WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:04.700
.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.615
- Oh, what'd you bring?

00:06.658 --> 00:08.704
Little baggies of snacks,
mini hand sanitizer.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.140
Is this a travel pillow?

00:10.184 --> 00:11.315
- Yeah, I've never
flown private before.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.447
I didn't know what to expect.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.578
- Dude, if you think
the jet's nice,

00:13.622 --> 00:15.276
we gotta take my yacht out.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.799
Catch a tailwind
down the coast.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.366
Modelos, limón,

00:18.409 --> 00:19.497
a warm body at every port.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.151
You would crush.

00:21.195 --> 00:24.067
And I'm there too on the boat.
I see everything.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.069
- Maybe we should wait quietly
until takeoff

00:26.113 --> 00:27.853
and save these conversations
until the engine noise

00:27.897 --> 00:28.854
can drown them out.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.247
- So touchdown in Iowa

00:30.291 --> 00:31.509
and then we tour the warehouse

00:31.553 --> 00:33.381
they're converting
into the Pika factory.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.078
Then we freshen up at the hotel

00:35.122 --> 00:36.819
before a picnic luncheon.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.516
- Oh, great, a picnic. Love
when my food

00:38.560 --> 00:40.518
gets to sweat in the sun
for a few hours.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.433
- Mm, and then
there's the, uh,

00:42.477 --> 00:44.653
official ribbon cutting
ceremony at the end of the day.

00:44.696 --> 00:45.828
- God, these townies really

00:45.871 --> 00:47.264
love a chance
to celebrate, don't they?

00:47.308 --> 00:48.700
- Well, this is the first
factory to open there

00:48.744 --> 00:50.746
since the recession.
It's a lot of new jobs.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.487
They--they want to
express their gratitude.

00:52.530 --> 00:53.879
- Ah, it's nice.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.099
The public never really
liked me when I was CEO

00:56.143 --> 00:57.405
of a drug company.
I don't know why.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.624
- Probably the opioid crisis.
- Maybe.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.192
- Or the price gouging
on prescription drugs.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.194
- You know what?
I was a "girlboss."

01:04.238 --> 01:05.804
That's very tough
for some people.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.546
- Jack, it's a private plane.
You don't need to buckle up.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.592
- Aren't private planes
usually the ones that crash?

01:10.635 --> 01:13.116
- Well, yeah, statistically.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.336
- Little liquid courage?
Take the edge off?

01:15.379 --> 01:17.816
- Oh, no thanks. I am good.
- Your call.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.210
Hey, Captain Stevens,
want a little eye opener?

01:20.254 --> 01:22.560
I already got it--
- You know what? I'll take it.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.693
- Hey, uh, Jack,
take it easy over there.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.825
It's a business trip
not a booze cruise.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.131
- Okay.

01:28.175 --> 01:31.526
- [sing-song]
Someone got in trouble.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.528
- ♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

01:33.571 --> 01:35.704
♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

01:35.747 --> 01:38.663
[chorus vocalizing]

01:39.534 --> 01:41.492
- And who do we have here?

01:41.536 --> 01:43.581
- Sharon has been working
nights at the gas station

01:43.625 --> 01:45.583
ever since the plant closed
13 years ago.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.586
- Barely saw my kids
but had to keep 'em fed.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.241
- I am so happy to get you back
on a regular schedule.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.590
- We'll have a night shift too.

01:52.634 --> 01:53.852
- Or the night shift.
It could to go either way.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.419
It might be great
to have your days free.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.247
- And this is Gary.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.901
- Hi there, Gary!
- Hey.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.556
You know, this is huge for me.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.733
I'm gonna get Paramount Plus
and Peacock.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.256
- Wow, kind of
a different perspective

02:06.300 --> 02:08.171
than the whole starving
family thing over here.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.346
- It's kind of cool, huh?

02:09.390 --> 02:10.565
Getting to give
all these people jobs.

02:10.608 --> 02:11.827
- Mm-hmm.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.002
- Are you on Tinder?

02:13.045 --> 02:14.656
- Dude, I'm the namesake
of the company

02:14.699 --> 02:16.440
whose factory
is gonna save this town.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.659
It's like being a god.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.182
How do I not let
some of the local ladies

02:19.226 --> 02:21.184
express their gratitude?
- And you don't think

02:21.228 --> 02:22.968
that's just
a little bit sleazy?

02:23.012 --> 02:24.448
- Jack, you have
to start taking advantage

02:24.492 --> 02:26.842
of the perks of this job.
You see Ted over there?

02:26.885 --> 02:28.539
He's just the head
of manufacturing.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.280
That guy gets so much P.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.674
He's literally drowning in P.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
You want in?
- No, I think I'll just

02:34.502 --> 02:35.894
continue with the work day
as planned.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.461
- More P for me.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.768
- Thank you. My daughter's
finally going to get braces.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.813
- You know,
they get a bad rap

02:41.857 --> 02:44.207
but I really didn't mind
having braces.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.991
- Leg braces?

02:46.035 --> 02:47.384
- Uh-huh. Yeah, mm-hmm.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.387
And, hey, you look at me now.
[chuckles]

02:50.431 --> 02:52.911
What is this Polio-ville?
- Mm-hmm.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.871
- I have been hearing
such great things

02:55.914 --> 02:57.916
from Ted for weeks.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.440
With your help, the Payne Pika

02:59.483 --> 03:02.704
will be the most affordable car
on the market.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.663
A car for the people
by the people.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.622
- What's the alternative
to that?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.364
- A car by animals for animals?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.235
- Oh, you've all been so kind.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.759
You know, Millbank
is surrounded by cornfields,

03:14.803 --> 03:16.500
but I'm the one
feeling buttered up.

03:16.544 --> 03:17.675
[all laugh]

03:17.719 --> 03:18.850
- See, that has
the cadence of a joke,

03:18.894 --> 03:20.330
but is that logically sound?

03:20.374 --> 03:21.897
You don't butter up
a cornfield.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.290
- No.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.335
- God, it's nice
to feel that love.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.772
Feels so good to do good
for this town.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.818
- Oh, yeah, these are salt
of the earth people.

03:29.861 --> 03:30.949
- Yeah.
- Simple folk.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.995
And not--not like
in-bred simple.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.649
Simple as in
their internet is slow

03:34.692 --> 03:38.392
and they don't care
about fiction books, you know?

03:38.435 --> 03:41.699
- I'm just realizing how little
face time we've had, Ted.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.659
- It's great to come to
a town and revitalize it, hmm?

03:44.702 --> 03:48.271
First the factory, then
other businesses will follow.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.533
Hip restaurants, you know?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.056
Bars.
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.668
- Good news for any mysterious
pass-through corporations

03:53.711 --> 03:56.279
that have picked up
plots of land here.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.674
"Janus LLC", its namesake,
the two-faced Roman god,

03:59.717 --> 04:01.458
always hiding itself
in the shadows.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
- You're saying
you bought land in Millbank.

04:03.765 --> 04:04.983
- One might say that, yes.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.768
- Hmm. And the rest is
you just, like,

04:06.811 --> 04:08.987
playing out some
kingpin real estate fantasy?

04:09.031 --> 04:10.685
- I'm having fun.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.904
It's okay to have fun
at work, Sadie.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.558
- Hey. What do you guys think?
Swipe right?

04:14.602 --> 04:16.734
- Mmm, jeesh,
she looks a little old.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.040
- She's a party girl.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.737
- I'd party too if I
lived through prohibition

04:19.781 --> 04:21.304
- I'm doing it.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.567
"No match." Huh.
- [chuckles]

04:23.611 --> 04:26.309
- Phone must be bricked
or something.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.703
- So how long
you been driving for?

04:28.746 --> 04:30.574
- About 17 years.
- Nice.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.359
Nice, nice. You like it?
- No.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.751
- Hmm.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.014
- How is this
their hospitality suite?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.755
- The upholstery
is weirdly crunchy.

04:37.799 --> 04:39.844
- That was the couch?

04:39.888 --> 04:41.759
I thought you had Skittles
in your pocket or something.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.500
- Oh, this is all gonna change.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.328
Pretty soon developers
are gonna come in,

04:45.372 --> 04:46.895
put up luxury hotels.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.592
And you know who profits?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.899
Why, the local landowners.
[chuckles]

04:50.942 --> 04:52.466
- You wanna hear
something funny?

04:52.509 --> 04:53.771
The government of Bolvaria

04:53.815 --> 04:55.425
just submitted their bid
for the factory.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.122
- This factory.
The one we're opening here?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.820
- A bit late
to the party, Bolvaria.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.691
- Ugh, that's all of Eastern
Europe.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.953
I heard
they're just discovering

05:01.997 --> 05:03.085
Kate & Allie over there.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.652
- Where is Bolvaria, anyway?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.436
- Between Albania
and North Macedonia.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.655
- Zoom out a little bit for me.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.831
- Next to Montenegro.
- Oh, right.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.833
- And then in Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.791
- Bosnia,
we bombed them in the '90s.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.141
Kicked the [bleep] out of them,
or saved them.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.752
We definitely helped
some of them.

05:17.795 --> 05:22.365
- In Hungary, Slovakia,
the Czech Republic, Germany.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.932
- Oh, yeah, Germany.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.108
I love Germany.
Oh, I mean, obviously now.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.675
Not--you know.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.807
I mean, kind of have
to say that nowadays, though.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.114
- These numbers
are extremely competitive.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.724
- Oh, really? Huh.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.597
That's um--
how is that possible?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.512
- Toyota just pulled
out of the facility.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.817
They're trying to fill it ASAP.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.428
- Well, I mean,
I wish that they could have

05:41.471 --> 05:43.386
made this offer
a few months ago.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.475
Little late now.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.651
Right?
- Uh, to move locations

05:47.695 --> 05:49.131
for the factory
that's already staffed

05:49.174 --> 05:51.133
where we're cutting the ribbon
in roughly six hours?

05:51.176 --> 05:53.744
Yeah, it is.
It's a little on the late side.

05:53.788 --> 05:54.876
- Yeah, this country

05:54.919 --> 05:56.443
doesn't sound
that great anyway.

05:56.486 --> 05:57.835
"Semi-autocratic,

05:57.879 --> 06:00.185
impoverished, and riddled
with human rights abuses."

06:00.229 --> 06:02.884
- But just to put it
out there, we'd save tens,

06:02.927 --> 06:05.843
hundreds of millions of dollars
over the production run.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.845
- I like how they make
the workers stand in formation,

06:07.889 --> 06:09.673
blank faces. It's a clean look.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.632
- See if they're around
a teleconference.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.460
I'm just gonna, you know,
thank them and let them know

06:13.503 --> 06:14.896
that it's, you know,
not gonna work out.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.985
- I think
an email rejection is fine.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.682
- Well, let's keep it
professional, you know.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.510
I just wanna
preserve company relations

06:20.554 --> 06:23.905
with Slovanmiria, uh, Europe.

06:26.603 --> 06:27.474
.

06:27.517 --> 06:28.866
- I have to say you have

06:28.910 --> 06:30.041
put together quite
the presentations, Gene.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.913
Unfortunately,
we have already gone down

06:31.956 --> 06:33.349
the road here in America.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.612
- I wish we could have
come to the table earlier.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.006
But we'd be willing
to reimburse you

06:38.049 --> 06:41.444
100% of what you have
spent there

06:41.488 --> 06:43.054
plus what it would
cost to move.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.273
- 100%.

06:44.316 --> 06:47.015
Wow, that's
the most percents possible.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.538
- Hey, the Bolivarian
National Zoo

06:48.582 --> 06:50.497
is advertised
as "full service."

06:50.540 --> 06:52.455
What is that?
What do you think that means?

06:52.499 --> 06:55.153
- Listen,
you've got a compelling pitch.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.504
I respect that.
- Ask about human rights.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.462
- And ask
if the zoo has any rules.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.116
- But Gene,
I have heard some rumors

07:01.159 --> 07:03.205
about some troubling things.

07:03.248 --> 07:06.034
Jailing reporters,
overzealous police forces,

07:06.077 --> 07:07.992
real red flags, and I'm not
afraid

07:08.036 --> 07:10.430
to hold your feet
to the fire here.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.040
Are there any human
rights abuses

07:12.083 --> 07:14.695
that I need to know about?

07:14.738 --> 07:15.957
- No.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.132
- Well, that's a relief.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.264
All right,
well, thank you for your time.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.962
Anything else on our end, guys?

07:21.005 --> 07:22.572
- What is a full service zoo?
- Wesley wants to know

07:22.616 --> 07:24.356
if he can [bleep]
the elephants at the zoo.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.401
- No? Great. Okay, good.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.490
All right,
well, thank you so much.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.405
Talk soon.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.320
Interesting, huh?
- Lot of money.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.104
- Yeah, I thought so too.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.585
I mean, we--
we are like minded there.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.065
Yeah, I mean, obviously,
we can't do it.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.414
But whoo!

07:38.458 --> 07:42.200
Gosh, that is interesting.
Yeah.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.508
Have we signed anything here?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.467
- We can't really
be considering this.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.033
- We're just
talking theoretically.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.427
I mean, this is
a theoretical conversation.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.646
- Whoa,
why'd you lock the door?

07:52.689 --> 07:54.256
- I thought
we might want some privacy.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.562
- We're just
having a conversation.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.389
Anyone can participate.
Anyone can listen.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.695
Maybe keep it locked, though.
That's--

07:58.739 --> 08:00.610
- I'll say it.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.959
We have to move the factory.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.744
We're trying to make
a $10,000 car.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.442
If we relocate, we could put
the money we save on labor

08:06.486 --> 08:07.835
into things like, I don't know,

08:07.878 --> 08:10.228
brakes that work
and engines that don't explode.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.491
And would not that be nice?

08:11.534 --> 08:12.970
- Right, for sure.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.582
But Millbank is good too.
Lots of opportunities here.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.454
At worst,
I'm on the fence, at worst.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.457
- But think about
the optics if we pull out.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.112
- Ah! "Pull out!"

08:24.155 --> 08:26.331
Come on, she--it's a layup.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.594
- The headline will read,

08:27.637 --> 08:30.466
"Payne abandons
desperate American town."

08:30.510 --> 08:32.599
- I mean,
but what is America really

08:32.642 --> 08:35.036
when you think about it?
You know, is it a place?

08:35.079 --> 08:37.125
Is it--is it confined
by--by borders?

08:37.168 --> 08:38.430
- Hell yeah, USA!

08:38.474 --> 08:40.215
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.478
I was--wait for me to get
where I was going with--

08:42.522 --> 08:44.132
I lost it. Sorry.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.395
- This is the kind of thing
that hurts your image.

08:46.438 --> 08:49.224
And morally, what about
the human rights abuses?

08:49.267 --> 08:52.314
Do we really wanna support
that kind of government?

08:52.357 --> 08:54.142
- Yes, okay,
but if the government

08:54.185 --> 08:55.796
even is doing anything bad--

08:55.839 --> 08:58.102
- And Gene was very strong in
convincing that they weren't.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.495
- That part
is out of our control.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.366
So the citizens over there
can either be oppressed

09:01.410 --> 09:03.543
or be oppressed
with jobs that pay well,

09:03.586 --> 09:05.327
by Bolvarian standards.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.633
- I mean, that is
kind of hard to argue with.

09:06.676 --> 09:07.721
It really does make sense.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.287
- So you're okay
just screwing over

09:09.331 --> 09:10.767
all these families?

09:10.811 --> 09:13.553
I'm--I'm sorry,
and maybe I'm out of line,

09:13.596 --> 09:15.119
but you wanted me to be
the voice of the workers.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.817
So that's exactly
what I'm being.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.254
I know firsthand
how important these jobs are

09:19.297 --> 09:21.430
to these families.
They're depending on us.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.736
- Very well said, Jack.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.738
Plus, we should keep in mind
the ripple effect

09:24.781 --> 09:26.174
that this would have on people

09:26.217 --> 09:28.132
who have invested
in the local economy.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.481
- Yeah, everyone's
keeping that in mind.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.657
- Cool. Good.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.528
- I get that
this is personal for you.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.617
But tell me,
is an American's life

09:34.661 --> 09:36.445
worth more than
a foreigner's life to you?

09:36.488 --> 09:39.100
- No, that's--
- That's a tough look, man.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.537
- No matter what we do, certain
people will benefit

09:41.581 --> 09:43.060
and certain people
will get hurt.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.322
I'd say it's zero sum

09:44.366 --> 09:46.716
except for one option
benefits the company

09:46.760 --> 09:47.848
which if you think about it,

09:47.891 --> 09:51.329
it's kind of the point
of our jobs.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.461
- Wow.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.290
Big change of plans
for Millbank

09:55.333 --> 09:57.684
and its community leaders
and business owners.

09:57.727 --> 09:58.815
Okay.

09:59.990 --> 10:03.385
- So we do have to put out
a statement at some point.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.866
Do we just say it was
a financial decision?

10:05.909 --> 10:07.563
- Ugh, isn't there
a better way to frame it?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.478
I mean, we're just gonna sound
like some heartless corporation

10:09.521 --> 10:10.871
that only cares
about the bottom line.

10:10.914 --> 10:14.396
- [chuckles]
Now why would they think that?

10:14.439 --> 10:15.571
Sorry.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.094
- I'm not happy
about it either.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.140
I mean, I was just getting
used to being the hero.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.794
Now, everybody here
is gonna hate my guts.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.230
- Everyone loves you, ma'am.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.581
- Oh, thank you so much, sir!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.802
We are having a private meeting
back here though, so--

10:28.845 --> 10:32.109
Shouldn't a business van come
with some sort of divider wall?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.241
You know what?
Get that idea down, Cyrus.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.372
That's good.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.417
- You want me
to write down "wall?"

10:35.460 --> 10:37.593
- "Divider wall."
- Got it.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.595
- I'm just not sure
how else to frame it.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.293
I mean, now that
everyone's jobs are going away,

10:42.337 --> 10:44.556
they'll have more time
for hobbies?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.428
- It'll be better
for the environment.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.734
If you saw all the hoops
we had to jump through

10:47.777 --> 10:49.649
to open the factory
in the first place.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.912
Groundwater surveys,
carbon capture certs.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.914
It's a miracle they haven't
backed out already.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.611
- Wait, what
do you mean by backed out?

10:55.655 --> 10:56.830
They can ask us to leave?

10:56.873 --> 10:58.745
- Yeah, I mean,
yeah, if they wanted.

10:58.788 --> 10:59.920
We had to persuade them

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
we'd be
"good environmental partners."

11:01.748 --> 11:03.837
- Oh, well,
let's un-persuade them.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.360
Let it get out that

11:05.403 --> 11:08.624
we might not be as eco-friendly
as we said, you know.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.712
I mean, that way
we're not leaving them,

11:09.756 --> 11:10.757
they're leaving us.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.236
- So basically,
you want us to be

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
the girl
who's so chicken [bleep]

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
breaking up with her boyfriend
that would just rather

11:15.457 --> 11:17.154
act toxic and make him dump us?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.765
- Exactly, that is
a great way of putting it.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.549
Thank you so much, Sadie.

11:20.592 --> 11:23.813
All right, people,
let's get toxic!

11:23.857 --> 11:26.294
- Oh, yeah, that's a little
on the nose, Wesley,

11:26.337 --> 11:27.338
but great idea.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.775
- What?
I didn't get any of that.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.298
I'm listening to Maron.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.560
He's in one of his moods.

11:39.916 --> 11:40.134
.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.745
- Katherine Hastings,
Tom Harper.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
Welcome to the great state
of Iowa.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.184
- Governor Harper,
what a pleasure.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.099
It is a beautiful state.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.710
Well, you know,
there's an old legend

11:50.753 --> 11:52.886
that the word Iowa
comes from the Native word

11:52.929 --> 11:54.714
for "beautiful."
- Well, that is apt.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.151
That is very, very apt
because it is a beautiful,

11:57.194 --> 11:58.761
pristine piece of land.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.024
I mean, you should see
some of the areas

12:01.068 --> 12:02.243
around our other factories.

12:02.286 --> 12:05.420
Oh, yowsa. [chuckles]

12:05.463 --> 12:07.944
- Unload it all.
Get whatever you can get.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.468
If we take a loss,
then it's your commission.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.253
Actually, hold on.
Anyone here have an interest

12:12.296 --> 12:13.950
in buying a strip mall?

12:13.994 --> 12:15.822
Forget it. Yep, dump it all.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.956
- Jeannette Watts
from "The Gazette?"

12:20.000 --> 12:22.132
- Yes.
- Sadie Ryan from Payne.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.352
We spoke on the phone.
- Oh, yes, hi.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.006
Nice to meet you in person.
- Yeah.

12:26.049 --> 12:29.792
Doing a big pie exposé, huh?
- Oh, Millbank's a small town.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.315
This could be
a six-part series.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.969
- Well, I have something

12:33.013 --> 12:35.798
that I think
you might be interested in.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.105
This is on deep background
but there's a rumor

12:38.148 --> 12:39.889
that our water contaminant
numbers

12:39.933 --> 12:42.152
might be a bit fudged.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.024
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.983
No one can know that I am
the one that told you that.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.158
- Got it.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.030
Well, don't worry
I won't say anything.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.075
- Thank you.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.037
You mean you won't write
that I was the source.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.386
- I won't write
anything at all.

12:58.429 --> 13:01.345
My lips are sealed.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.957
- Hi. Are you Wesley Payne?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.001
- The one and only.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.350
- I just wanna say

13:06.394 --> 13:07.874
we're all so grateful
that you're coming here.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.312
It has been a rough few years
and it means everything.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.531
- Look, you are pretty,

13:13.575 --> 13:17.013
but just gonna be honest,
I'm not a huge fan of freckles.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.972
So I'm gonna do a lap

13:19.015 --> 13:20.364
and see what other talent's
out there

13:20.408 --> 13:23.150
but maybe
I'll circle back around.

13:23.193 --> 13:26.022
Cool?
- O--okay.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.850
- It's not a no just--

13:27.894 --> 13:30.070
you're on the waitlist,
young lady.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.768
Not too young. Not--

13:33.943 --> 13:35.031
- Hey.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.946
- Hey, Jack.
You having a good time?

13:36.990 --> 13:38.774
- Uh, not really.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.037
I just keep feeling like
some type of evil overlord

13:41.081 --> 13:42.473
or something who doesn't care
about the commoners.

13:42.517 --> 13:45.868
- Mm. I'm thinking about
buying a castle.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.175
Bolverian real estate prices
are gonna surge

13:48.218 --> 13:49.480
when we announce this move.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.353
So if you're interested,
get in now.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.312
- Yeah, I don't think
I'm a castle type of a guy.

13:55.356 --> 13:58.402
- Jack, every Black man
is a castle type of guy.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.230
Maybe one for your mom?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.406
- So listen,
anything you need at any time,

14:02.450 --> 14:04.800
just call, okay?
Help cleaning up red tape,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.020
dealing with regulators,
whatever you need.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.499
- I appreciate that.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.023
Because as you know,
there were quite a few concerns

14:10.066 --> 14:12.068
with the environmental impact
of our factory.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.157
- Yeah, well, that's
the "green beans" for ya.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.332
You know, I'm telling you,

14:15.376 --> 14:17.291
they would trade
8,000 well-paying jobs

14:17.334 --> 14:19.075
if it disturbs the beauty sleep
of, you know,

14:19.119 --> 14:22.122
some subspecies of snail.

14:22.165 --> 14:25.255
- Although, some of their
concerns are totally crazy,

14:25.299 --> 14:28.345
the smog and with the chemicals
we use in our paint,

14:28.389 --> 14:30.043
there have been cancer
clusters.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.609
- Hey, hey.
No, no, I didn't hear that.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.350
No, no, see, I don't know
what I don't know.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.438
- Yeah, but I'm just
telling you.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.613
- Nothing! Nothing.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.441
You're--you're not
telling me anything.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.878
Because see,
we're just--we're friends

14:38.921 --> 14:41.402
and we're chatting
about the weather, right?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.447
- Yes. It is--
it's beautiful weather.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.014
Although it won't be for long.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.624
You know with
the carbon dioxide--

14:46.668 --> 14:50.280
- ♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

14:50.324 --> 14:53.022
both: ♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

14:53.066 --> 14:55.938
- Sorry, just to be clear,
you can report that story

14:55.982 --> 14:57.287
just don't say that
it came from me.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.680
- Oh, that's okay.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.900
I wouldn't want you to get
in trouble if it got out.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.292
You seem nice.
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.948
But what I'm telling you
could be huge,

15:05.992 --> 15:07.210
like Watergate huge.

15:07.254 --> 15:10.257
- I know. Thank you for
trusting me.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.520
My lips are sealed.
- No, no.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.000
- Oh, my God.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.305
This is supposed to be
a blind bake.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.307
Susan's name is on the tin.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.440
- And based on an old legend,

15:19.483 --> 15:23.009
the word Iowa comes from the
Native word for "beautiful."

15:23.052 --> 15:26.055
And I cannot think
of anything more beautiful

15:26.099 --> 15:30.581
than 8,000 new jobs!

15:30.625 --> 15:31.887
- Any luck?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.149
- Let's just say
the local press

15:33.193 --> 15:34.977
isn't exactly
Woodward and Bernstein.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.022
- I told a few families

15:36.065 --> 15:37.414
that the runoff
from the factory

15:37.458 --> 15:39.503
could lead to smaller penis
sizes for newborns.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.591
They didn't care.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.245
- What is wrong
with this town?

15:42.289 --> 15:44.160
- Environment's
been politicized, you know.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.336
This is something only
coastal elites care about now.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.555
"Liberal cucks," you know?

15:47.598 --> 15:49.122
- Or maybe
they're just desperate.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.906
Hey, when you've been
out of work for a year,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
hole in the ozone
does not seem that important.

15:52.429 --> 15:53.691
- Whatever happened
to that hole?

15:53.735 --> 15:55.215
We just stopped
talking about it.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.956
- You know, it's true.
We might as well be threatening

15:56.999 --> 15:58.566
to take away their
"New Yorker" subscriptions.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.221
I mean, we need to focus on
what these people care about.

16:01.264 --> 16:06.661
- It's not their kids' penises,
I'll tell you that.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.054
- Yo.
- [gasps]

16:08.097 --> 16:09.707
- It's cool, it's me.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.536
So no guarantees,
but I did a loop

16:12.580 --> 16:14.712
and I think
it's looking good for you.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.192
- What's looking good?

16:16.236 --> 16:17.628
- [chuckles] Right.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.674
"What's looking good?"

16:19.717 --> 16:22.677
I like it. I like that.
You're trouble.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.549
You know, if you wore
a wide brimmed hat

16:25.593 --> 16:30.119
it might help with the
freckles.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.035
I don't know, see a derm.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.733
Excuse me. Pardon me.
- Katherine Hastings!

16:35.777 --> 16:40.042
[cheers and applause]

16:40.086 --> 16:41.609
- Oh, gosh, you know,

16:41.652 --> 16:43.219
it's funny,

16:43.263 --> 16:45.395
Millbank
is surrounded by cornfields

16:45.439 --> 16:47.354
but I'm the one
feeling buttered up.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.964
[laughter]

16:49.008 --> 16:50.270
- Are you enjoying that?

16:50.313 --> 16:51.575
- The situation
will not be helped

16:51.619 --> 16:52.750
by me not eating corn.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.057
- This factory
will bring jobs...

16:55.101 --> 16:56.624
[cheers and applause]

16:56.667 --> 17:00.367
But something else too, change.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.587
We all love change, right?

17:03.631 --> 17:06.982
Boba shops
and cannabis dispensaries

17:07.026 --> 17:09.680
and ethnic small plate
restaurants.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.204
"Tapas," we call 'em.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.119
[cheers and applause]
- Tapas!

17:13.162 --> 17:15.686
[cheers and applause]

17:15.730 --> 17:17.732
- Okay.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.387
Plus, new--new types of people,

17:20.430 --> 17:23.216
of all races and faiths.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.435
Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.611
There could be a mosque
on every street corner

17:27.655 --> 17:29.178
right here in Millbank.

17:29.222 --> 17:34.749
[cheers and applause]
- What is this? Berkeley?

17:34.792 --> 17:37.665
- A well-paying job can get you
real progressive real fast.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.101
- And yes, of course

17:39.145 --> 17:41.669
there will be homeless people,

17:41.712 --> 17:45.281
and with them, methadone
clinics and needle exchanges

17:45.325 --> 17:48.284
and pop-up abortion sites.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.635
But I say if you don't want
that in your backyard,

17:51.679 --> 17:54.334
you don't want Payne
in your front yard.

17:54.377 --> 17:59.469
[cheers and applause]

17:59.513 --> 18:01.341
And also Antifa.

18:03.865 --> 18:04.083
.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.694
- When I think of all the
inspectors I bribed

18:06.737 --> 18:07.999
over the years to look
the other way about something,

18:08.043 --> 18:09.523
none of it mattered.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.046
They wouldn't have
kicked us out no matter what.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.265
It was just a waste of money.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.614
- Honestly, it's gross.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.615
Where's their xenophobia?

18:14.658 --> 18:15.790
Their fear of anything
different?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.226
All they care about
is their jobs.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.793
They're hypocrites.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.273
- If you think about it,
being a hypocrite

18:20.316 --> 18:23.102
is the worst thing you can be.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.190
You have to think
about it hard though.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.713
It's definitely not intuitive.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.758
- How are we gonna
handle the ribbon cutting?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.064
- We should
just skip it and go home.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.761
- Wait, so we're
gonna ghost the entire town?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.328
- Yeah, I mean,
we could spit in their food

18:32.372 --> 18:34.069
and they wouldn't care.
I mean, we need to cut and run.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.811
Sir, could you take us
to the airfield, please?

18:36.854 --> 18:38.160
- Sure thing.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.249
Are you saying you're
not gonna make cars here?

18:40.293 --> 18:42.164
- I'm sorry,
but could you not eavesdrop?

18:42.208 --> 18:43.818
It's not entirely your fault.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.211
There's no divider wall here,

18:45.254 --> 18:48.518
but take some
personal responsibility.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.694
- Can't believe
we had to leave early.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.696
I'm so on with this cute chick.

18:52.740 --> 18:53.915
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.525
I mean, there was
definitely a freckle issue

18:55.569 --> 18:57.179
but with some heavy foundation,
it would have been fine.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.920
- You know,
I was drowning in P.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.662
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.186
- Hey, you okay?

19:04.230 --> 19:05.753
- Just sucks, you know?

19:05.796 --> 19:07.189
All their jobs are going away
and we're sitting here

19:07.233 --> 19:09.670
on a private jet
having cocktails.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.106
- Yeah, I know.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.586
I grew up in a town like this

19:12.629 --> 19:15.980
and my dad just went from
one factory job to the next.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.243
Oh, did you think
you're the only one

19:17.286 --> 19:18.940
without a trust fund?

19:18.983 --> 19:20.246
This is the job.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.030
Like, it's private jets
and hard decisions.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.249
You just gotta suck it up

19:23.292 --> 19:24.859
and deal with the guilt
in your own time.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.208
- You can do that?

19:26.252 --> 19:28.210
- Uh, 9:00 till 6:00,
I am a robot.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.865
After 6:00,
I am dangerously unstable.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.607
A depressing shell of a human.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.304
- Hey guys, can someone
put on the news?

19:35.348 --> 19:37.219
- Yeah.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.612
- These shocking images

19:38.655 --> 19:40.701
from the small European
nation of Bolvaria,

19:40.744 --> 19:43.225
where a coup in progress
has already been called

19:43.269 --> 19:47.708
"A Thousand Bloody Nights."

19:47.751 --> 19:49.318
- Well,
that's not great for us.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.060
Captain Stevens,
turn the plane around, please.

19:52.103 --> 19:53.366
- You can meet up
with that girl.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.671
- Ah, better not.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.107
I'm actually
pretty numb down there,

19:56.151 --> 19:57.935
so it takes me
forever to do it.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.894
- Jack,
you must be happy, right?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.852
Staying in Millbank.
You got a win.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.985
- Yeah, I guess all's
well that ends well.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.378
- Oh, look,
they're executing

20:05.421 --> 20:09.643
their country's intelligentsia
in the streets.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.993
- Oh, there's Gene.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.256
There are too many people
to thank

20:14.300 --> 20:16.215
for making today possible.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.868
You know, it's funny,

20:17.912 --> 20:20.262
Millbank is surrounded
by cornfields,

20:20.306 --> 20:24.266
but I'm the one feeling
buttered up.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.963
- Mm, tough crowd.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.270
- Yep, I think our van driver

20:28.314 --> 20:31.839
might've leaked that
we almost abandoned the town.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.276
- Just sell the castle!

20:34.320 --> 20:37.018
Get whatever you
can get for it.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.281
What do you mean
it's been "nationalized?"

20:39.325 --> 20:41.022
- Is there
any truth to the rumors

20:41.065 --> 20:42.676
that you were in talks
with Bolvaria

20:42.719 --> 20:44.678
and had planned
to pull out of Millbank?

20:44.721 --> 20:47.115
- [laughs]

20:47.158 --> 20:48.377
"Pull out?" Come on.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.379
I can't be the only one
hearing this stuff.

20:50.423 --> 20:53.164
- Uh, no, I don't know
where those rumors came from.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.949
And obviously our hearts go out

20:54.992 --> 20:56.994
to the good people of Bolvaria.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.779
- The insurgents
or the dictatorship?

20:58.822 --> 21:02.304
- Uh, the--the good people,
you know, on both sides.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.438
I mean, you know, we just hope
that they find common ground

21:05.481 --> 21:07.178
once the butchering
is completed--

21:07.222 --> 21:09.703
the alleged butchering
on, you know, both sides of--

21:09.746 --> 21:10.965
I think let's get to the--
- Yeah.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.314
Yah! [imitates gun cocking]
- Do that now.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.317
Great, here we go. [laughs]

21:15.361 --> 21:16.710
- Whoo!

21:16.753 --> 21:19.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Millbank.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.323
[munching noises]

21:21.367 --> 21:22.977
- Don't do that anymore.
- PAC-MAN?
