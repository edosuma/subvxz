Without the five beautiful, talented women

00:17.650 --> 00:20.881
their movies would only have

02:29.482 --> 02:32.974
About a month ago,
I tweeted a photo of myself.

02:33.052 --> 02:36.146
I did a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz.

- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

02:38.358 --> 02:40.292
High end, high end.

02:40.693 --> 02:44.424
So, we did this photo shoot
and I was like, um,

02:45.231 --> 02:46.721
"I want to take off my clothes."

02:46.799 --> 02:48.994
- And she was like, "Please don't."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:49.068 --> 02:53.266

"Like things are going south, you know,

02:55.375 --> 02:57.502
"I want to do it before it's over."

02:57.877 --> 03:00.243
So I took off my clothes and she
was like, "It's already over."

03:00.313 --> 03:01.302
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

03:01.548 --> 03:03.709
And then, uh, and then the photo came out

03:03.783 --> 03:05.216
and I was like, "I'm gonna share it."

03:05.285 --> 03:10.552
And, um, this is the word
you don't want people to use

03:11.658 --> 03:14.650
after a photo of you where
you're nude goes viral...

03:16.362 --> 03:17.488
"Brave."

Garrett!

06:15.875 --> 06:16.933
Huh?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.175
Has this ever happened to you?

06:19.412 --> 06:22.142
You meet a guy, fall in love,
get married, have a baby,

06:22.215 --> 06:25.207
and then your husband
up and fucks your hot young nanny?

06:25.284 --> 06:26.717
Of course it has.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.777
And it's your fault.
What were you thinking?

06:28.855 --> 06:30.584
Hiring a nanny who's hotter
and younger than you

06:30.656 --> 06:32.317
is like hiring a wolf to...

06:34.160 --> 06:35.149
I don't know.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.286
Here at matronly nannies,

06:36.362 --> 06:37.920
we match you and your family

06:37.997 --> 06:40.363
with only the most matronly older nannies.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.424
You won't have to worry about your husband

06:42.502 --> 06:45.494
getting all hot and heavy with
such qualified nannies as...

06:46.005 --> 06:47.404
Hadassah,

06:47.473 --> 06:48.872
Rosita,

06:48.941 --> 06:51.136
and straight-up Mrs. Doubtfire.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.269
All our nannies are trained in infant CPR

06:53.346 --> 06:55.337
and even in their heyday were fours.

06:55.681 --> 06:56.670
Call now.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.516
(MUSIC PLAYING)

06:59.886 --> 07:01.547
Why do men fuck their nannies?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.854
Because you're with them
every day, every day, every day,

07:04.424 --> 07:05.584
and you become friends,

07:05.658 --> 07:06.886
and then all of a sudden, your wife shuts...

07:06.959 --> 07:08.187
- When you have a kid...
- Yeah.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.821
Shuts down sexually, 'cause
she's tired, she goes to bed.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.762
But your nanny's kinda, "Hey."
You become friends,

07:12.832 --> 07:14.732
and all of the sudden,
the boobie kinda slips out,

07:14.801 --> 07:16.530
then all of a sudden,
you come out of the shower,

07:16.602 --> 07:17.830
and you're like, "There's no towel."

07:17.904 --> 07:19.872
And she's like,
"Oh, you need the towel, Mr. Kelly?"

07:19.939 --> 07:22.305
- And you're like, "Oh, okay, sorry..."
- What? Is she Scottish?

07:22.375 --> 07:23.808
- What just happened there?
- (CHUCKLING)

07:23.876 --> 07:25.036
She's Mexican-Scottish.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.045
Oh, okay. Wow, this got real specific, Bob.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.007
You know the wife goes...
All the time she was burping the kid,

07:30.082 --> 07:32.175
the eye contact between
the guy and the nanny.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.310
- Very <i>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.</i>
- That must be so hot, though,

07:34.387 --> 07:36.355
just knowing that your nanny
is willing to do it.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.390
Can't get a good-Iooking nanny.
You gotta get like a...

07:38.458 --> 07:40.688
Like an eastern European with a dead tooth

07:40.760 --> 07:43.092
and a mole you could hang a coat off of.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.430
- Yeah, you can't get a hot Dominican.
- No.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.059
You know, not even like
a Haitian lady that can cook,

07:49.135 --> 07:50.193
'cause that turns me on, too.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.896
How fucked-up-Iooking
would the nanny have to...

07:52.004 --> 07:53.835
Like she has to be bald right here.

07:53.906 --> 07:54.895
Yeah, she...
(CHUCKLES)

07:54.974 --> 07:56.839
She'd have to look like
she survived an honor killing

07:56.909 --> 07:58.877
for me not to try to have sex with her.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.807
(MUSIC PLAYING)

08:04.484 --> 08:06.042
Oh, hey, did you get a chance

08:06.118 --> 08:07.983
to look at the proposal I sent you last week?

08:08.054 --> 08:09.521
Yeah, no.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.651
I will get to it when I get to it, I guess.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.153
Hey. I got this.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.726
Hey, Sal, I'd ask you how your weekend was,

08:17.797 --> 08:19.128
but I like stalk your Instagrams.

08:19.699 --> 08:20.996
Someone saw three sunsets.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.631
But here's the thing, though.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.432
One sunset, three filters.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.064
Oh, fuck you, Sal!

08:27.139 --> 08:29.630
You tricked me. You are so bad.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.734
You're like the king of Instagram.

08:31.811 --> 08:35.679
Anyway, I've got this really
dumb proposal that's so stupid,

08:35.748 --> 08:37.578
but I'd love your eyes on it.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.447
Anything for you, kiddo.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.211
Boop.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.818
Sal never boops me or looks at my work.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.086
None of the guys here do.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.387
You should try my guy-gles.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.587
They're like Google glass,

08:49.662 --> 08:50.993
but they show you the kind of woman

08:51.063 --> 08:52.496
the guy in front of you needs you to be.

08:52.565 --> 08:53.623
"Needs you to be"?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.862
Yeah, you know, like flirty victim,
spunky kid sister,

08:56.936 --> 08:58.267
nurturing mother, but flirty,

08:58.738 --> 09:00.603
wounded skank, step-milf,

09:00.673 --> 09:02.937
sexy sex kitten, flirty sex kitten,

09:03.009 --> 09:05.477
flirty friend of mom,
manic pixie or Amy Adams.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.502
- Oh.
- Here, try them.

09:08.247 --> 09:09.339
Okay.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.178
- Wow, they hurt.
- Yeah, a lot.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.445
Now go hand out those proposals.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.543
Oh, oh.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.548
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
<i>This is Ryan.</i>

09:18.624 --> 09:20.216
<i>No one had sex with him in high school</i>

09:20.293 --> 09:21.954
<i>because he had red hair and no dick.</i>

09:22.028 --> 09:24.189
<i>Has no interest in you but needs</i>
<i>to know you'd fuck him.</i>

09:24.263 --> 09:25.730
<i>- Needs to know you'd fuck him.</i>
- Hey, Ryan.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.154
Oh, my God.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.530
I feel so weird talking to you,

09:28.601 --> 09:31.001
'cause I had the craziest dream
about you last night.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.300
Oh, my God, I can't focus around you.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.406
Really? What was it?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.175
- I really shouldn't say.
- Come on.

09:37.677 --> 09:41.704
Here I am going on and on about
my wet dream about your dick. (CHUCKLES)

09:41.781 --> 09:43.544

your husband's sexual interest,

18:02.147 --> 18:05.116
I think I'm pretty good at, like, bowling.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.149
- Yeah?
- Swimming, in the summer.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.316
Do you pick a fake name
when you go bowling?

18:09.822 --> 18:10.880
To put up on the screen?

18:10.956 --> 18:12.446
With friends of mine, I do.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.190
- Lf you're with friends of yours.
- Yeah.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.326
Um, I say that my name is Sharita Chapitall.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.127
- Cool.
- It's pretty good, right?

18:19.198 --> 18:21.132
- Yeah.
- Who is the happiest person you know?

18:21.633 --> 18:23.157
- My sister.
- Really?

18:23.235 --> 18:24.327
Are you guys like best friends?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.137
Uh, yeah, yeah.

18:26.572 --> 18:27.834
- Oh, no!
- Yeah, we are.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.567
- Some days, right?
- Some days we are.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.170
She's the main person.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.336
- She's your main person.
- Yeah.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.676
- Yeah, that's how my sister is, too.
- Cool.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.373
- But then sometimes...
- Mmm?

18:39.418 --> 18:41.784
I'm like, "What is your problem today?"

18:41.954 --> 18:43.478
- Me too.
- All right.

18:46.024 --> 18:47.321
- Anyway... Just between us.
- Just between us.

18:47.392 --> 18:48.484
That does not leave this room.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.857
- Yeah.
- Um...

18:49.962 --> 18:52.396
What do you want people to know
about people with Down syndrome

18:52.498 --> 18:53.624
that they don't know?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.800
Don't label us.

18:56.401 --> 18:59.427
I think that we are just like you,

18:59.872 --> 19:01.100
and just treat us just like you.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.573
Have you been...
You've been discriminated against.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.100
In third grade, I was,

19:06.178 --> 19:08.271
but all my friends took care of it for me.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.371
Really? What happened in third grade?

19:10.716 --> 19:12.411
He called me the R-word.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.851
Uh, retarded. Um...

19:16.255 --> 19:17.654
- And you hate that word.
- And I hate that word.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.712
- Yeah.
- You know?

19:18.790 --> 19:21.691
All my friends, when they made
him apologize, he apologized,

19:22.461 --> 19:23.860
and then the next day in school,

19:23.929 --> 19:27.365
he carried my lunch for me,
carried my books for me.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.030
And then years later into high school,

19:30.102 --> 19:32.502
he asked me to the prom,
but I couldn't go

19:32.838 --> 19:34.465
'cause I was already going
with somebody else.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.564
Oh, my gosh.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.074
That's cool, your friends
really have your back.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.942
Yeah, they do.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.342
Thank you so much for doing this, girl.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.175
- Thank you very much for having me.
- Yeah.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.405
- Let's get a drink.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.010
Malibu bay breeze!

19:46.552 --> 19:48.452
(MUSIC PLAYING)

19:50.055 --> 19:52.023
You take your shirt off in front of a guy,

19:52.090 --> 19:54.149
and he's like, "Damn!

19:54.893 --> 19:57.885
- "You look mad brave right now."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:01.833 --> 20:05.064

I'm pretty normal and like here,

20:06.004 --> 20:09.735
but then I get like really brave, like right here.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.300
I'm like Joan of Arc on my upper thighs, like...

20:14.746 --> 20:16.111
Oh, my, God, you guys.
Don't feel bad for me.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.546
You know I'm, like, very rich now, right?

20:17.616 --> 20:18.708

- Um...

20:19.251 --> 20:21.219

20:23.655 --> 20:25.054
What kind of woman...

20:25.123 --> 20:26.647
- Hold on.
- (LAUGHS)

20:26.925 --> 20:29.086
Step-milf, sexy sex kitten,

20:29.461 --> 20:30.792
flirty sex kitten.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.022
Flirty friend's mom...

20:32.097 --> 20:33.086
I'm sorry.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.154

20:34.233 --> 20:36.064
You know, like flirty victim, spunky...

20:36.134 --> 20:37.658
Wait, hold on.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.597
Wounded skank.

20:40.105 --> 20:41.402
Spunky kid sister.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.071
Flirty mom...
(LAUGHS) I'm sorry.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.700
I'm sorry, I'm trying not to look at you.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.373
Where are you from?

20:48.447 --> 20:49.709
- Australia.
- No.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.373
(CREW LAUGHING)

20:53.352 --> 20:55.081

21:14.640 --> 21:17.336
CREW MEMBER:
