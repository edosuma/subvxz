WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.167
- OKAY, SON,
TODAY YOU'RE GONNA LEARN

00:11.200 --> 00:12.700
HOW TO POSSESS AN OBJECT.

00:12.733 --> 00:14.700
IT'S A LOT TRICKIER
THAN POSSESSING PEOPLE.

00:14.733 --> 00:18.067
- I'M SO READY FOR THIS,
POPS!

00:18.100 --> 00:21.400
- YOU CAN DO IT, LOUIE.
WHOO!

00:21.433 --> 00:24.167
- DOES SHE REALLY HAVE
TO BE HERE?

00:24.200 --> 00:28.733
- COME ON, LOUIE.
SHE DID MAKE T-SHIRTS.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.600
- MAN, I'M HANDSOME!

00:32.267 --> 00:33.567
FINE, SHE CAN STAY.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.367
SO WHAT OBJECT AM I GONNA
BE POSSESSING?

00:36.400 --> 00:38.367
A GARGOYLE

00:38.400 --> 00:41.533
- NO.
A CANTALOUPE.

00:41.567 --> 00:45.200
NOW, JUST DO LIKE YOUR
GHOST TEXTBOOK SAYS.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.667
BREATHE, CONCENTRATE,

00:47.700 --> 00:50.667
AND THINK OUTSIDE IN.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.700
- YEAH, YEAH.
BREATHE, CONSTIPATE--

00:52.733 --> 00:54.633
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:56.533 --> 00:57.633
HERE I GO.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.633
- THIS CAN'T END WELL.

01:04.667 --> 01:05.933
- DUCK!

01:14.500 --> 01:19.600
- I SHOULD'VE MADE
A LOUIE BIB.

01:19.633 --> 01:21.667
- HEY, IT'S HARDER
THAN IT LOOKS.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.833
- IT'S OKAY, SON.

01:23.867 --> 01:26.767
JUST KEEP STUDYING.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.667
- POP QUIZ.
WHO'S GOT FOUR THUMBS

01:31.700 --> 01:33.633

PRESTON/HATHAWAY

01:33.667 --> 01:35.633
FAMILY GARAGE SALE?

01:35.667 --> 01:38.233
THIS GUY!

01:39.667 --> 01:41.667
SAY "FAMILY SCRAPBOOK!"

01:41.700 --> 01:44.367
- NO.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.700
YOU DO REALIZE GHOSTS DON'T
SHOW UP IN THE PHOTOS,

01:46.733 --> 01:49.500
SO NO ONE WILL EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE.

01:49.533 --> 01:52.067
I'LL KNOW, LOUIE.
I'LL KNOW.

01:52.100 --> 01:55.667
- MILES, GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THESE BOXES.

01:55.700 --> 02:00.533
AND YOU, NO TRYING POSSESSIONS
WITHOUT ME AROUND.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.767
I'M SERIOUS.
BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN

02:02.800 --> 02:04.300
WHEN YOU DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.867
- OKAY, I GET IT, DAD.

02:08.267 --> 02:09.733
- HERE I GO!

02:12.100 --> 02:15.100
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.067
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:23.100 --> 02:25.800
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:25.833 --> 02:28.200
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:28.233 --> 02:31.667
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:31.700 --> 02:34.067
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:34.100 --> 02:35.633
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:35.667 --> 02:38.433
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:38.467 --> 02:41.333
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:41.367 --> 02:43.233
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:43.267 --> 02:47.067
*

02:47.100 --> 02:48.767
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:48.800 --> 02:51.267
*

02:56.500 --> 02:59.267
- RAY, PLEASE TALK
TO YOUR SON.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.867
LOUIE'S ALWAYS HOGGING
THE BATHROOM,

03:00.900 --> 03:03.400
PRACTICING HIS GHOST SCREAMS.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.800
- HE LIKES HOW THE ECHOES
MAKE HIM SOUND MORE POWERFUL.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.800
HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.733
I WISH HE WAS MORE
LIKE MILES.

03:11.767 --> 03:14.600
SMILE!

03:14.633 --> 03:18.333
- AAH!

03:18.367 --> 03:21.133
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
WITH NORMAL GHOSTS?

03:21.167 --> 03:24.233
- RAY, I APPRECIATE YOU
DONATING SO MUCH STUFF

03:24.267 --> 03:25.433
TO THE GARAGE SALE.

03:25.467 --> 03:26.733
- WELL, WITH TWO FAMILIES HERE,

03:26.767 --> 03:27.900
WE NEED TO MAKE SPACE,
RIGHT?

03:27.933 --> 03:29.833
- MMM, SPACE IS GOOD,

03:29.867 --> 03:31.700
SO WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GETTING
IN EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.233
ARE YOUR PRICES TOO HIGH?

03:33.267 --> 03:35.900
YOU SHOULD ADJUST THEM.
THEY FEEL TOO HIGH.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.733
$200 FOR A BROKEN
FISHING POLE?

03:38.767 --> 03:40.667
- HEY, THAT ROD BROKE
DURING A FIGHT

03:40.700 --> 03:42.333
WITH A 20-POUND CATFISH.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.733
THE STORY ALONE
IS WORTH THE PRICE.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.267
- I TOTALLY GET IT NOW.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.533
10 BUCKS.

03:49.567 --> 03:53.200
- I CLAIM THIS POLE
AND THIS RAG

03:53.233 --> 03:57.300
AS THE BANNER
FOR MY CASTLE.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.800
- HONEY, WE NEED THOSE BOXES
FOR OUR GARAGE SALE.

04:00.833 --> 04:03.933
COULD YOU PLEASE STOP
EXPANDING YOUR EMPIRE?

04:07.667 --> 04:08.900
A MARSHMALLOW CANNON?

04:08.933 --> 04:10.900
FRANKIE...

04:10.933 --> 04:12.800
DO IT AGAIN.

04:16.900 --> 04:19.500
I HAD A LIGHT BREAKFAST.

04:22.233 --> 04:25.233
- FRANKIE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE PLAYING IN A BOX FORT.

04:25.267 --> 04:28.400
WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE,
TWO YEARS OLD?

04:29.767 --> 04:32.500
OH, MY GOSH,

04:32.533 --> 04:37.700

THE BEST MEDICINE.

04:37.733 --> 04:40.133
- YEAH, I'M THE TWO-YEAR-OLD.

04:41.867 --> 04:44.633
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IF NURSE TAMMY IS EVEN HER NAME.

04:44.667 --> 04:49.600
I CERTAINLY DON'T STILL CARE
ABOUT A STUPID BEAR.

04:49.633 --> 04:51.800
I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU.

04:54.867 --> 04:58.367
- ALL RIGHT, COAST IS CLEAR.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.300
TIME FOR ME TO POSSESS
THAT PEACOCK.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.500
FRANKIE, YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO WATCH THIS.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.433
- YEAH, I AM.

05:07.467 --> 05:11.533
- OKAY, THEN,
HERE COMES PEACOCK TIME!

05:12.800 --> 05:14.600
- YEAH, LOOK AT ME!

05:14.633 --> 05:17.700

05:22.933 --> 05:26.267
BUT YOU'RE NURSE TAMMY.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.167

05:28.200 --> 05:30.533

05:30.567 --> 05:33.900

05:33.933 --> 05:36.933
- I'M ON IT.
GETTING OUT NOW.

05:41.567 --> 05:45.567
OH, NO, IT DIDN'T WORK.
I'M STUCK!

05:45.600 --> 05:47.800
FRANKIE,
IF MY DAD FINDS OUT,

05:47.833 --> 05:51.367
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.433
- HMM. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT
PINK'S NOT REALLY YOUR COLOR.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.167
- MILES' BABY CLOTHES.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.567
AN ENTIRE BOX OF BABY BOW TIES?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.633

06:07.667 --> 06:10.867

06:16.433 --> 06:18.733
I CAN TELL YOU'RE A GUY

06:18.767 --> 06:21.200
FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

06:28.433 --> 06:30.900

06:30.933 --> 06:33.533
- WHOA, I MARKED THOSE 500!

06:33.567 --> 06:35.233

FOR 10.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.667
- NO. I...
HAVE ISSUES.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.600
THIS IS BAD.

06:52.633 --> 06:55.067
THIS IS VERY BAD!

06:59.133 --> 07:01.667
- LOUIE, STOP PANICKING!

07:01.700 --> 07:03.433
I'M GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF THERE.

07:03.467 --> 07:07.900
WE JUST NEED TO REMAIN CALM
AND ACT RATIONALLY.

07:09.233 --> 07:12.633
- OW! OW! OW-OW-OW!

07:12.667 --> 07:15.433

07:27.667 --> 07:30.700
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
SAY ANYTHING, FRANKIE.

07:30.733 --> 07:34.900
- HEY, I'M NO SNITCH.
I TAKE CARE OF MY FRIENDS.

07:34.933 --> 07:37.800
UNLESS THEY CROSS ME.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.367
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR GHOST TEXT BOOK?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.733
THAT'LL TELL US WHAT TO DO.
STAY HERE.

07:43.767 --> 07:47.567
- I'M WEARING PRINCESS SHOES.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.500
WHERE AM I GOING?

07:50.533 --> 07:52.600
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

07:52.633 --> 07:56.633
UH-OH.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.833
- MICHELLE, THESE ARE
COLLECTOR'S ITEMS.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.900
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SELL THEM
FOR LESS THAN...

08:00.933 --> 08:03.333
50.

08:08.267 --> 08:11.500

08:14.400 --> 08:17.733
I MEAN, IT'S NOT UNWASHED
GYM SOCKS OR ANYTHING.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.633

THAT STUPID BEAR

08:39.467 --> 08:41.467
LAYING AROUND ANYWHERE?

08:41.500 --> 08:45.133

A MINUTE AGO.

08:45.167 --> 08:48.400

08:49.867 --> 08:52.433
YOU DON'T THINK--

08:52.467 --> 08:55.633
- LOUIE!
I MEAN TAMMY.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.633
- MOM, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU GRABBED MY BEAR DOLL.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.233

09:08.933 --> 09:11.167

09:11.200 --> 09:14.267
- IT WAS LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.133
MOSTLY BECAUSE
SHE PAID ME IN CANDY.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.233
GUMDROP?

09:18.267 --> 09:20.667
NO? WELL...

09:20.700 --> 09:23.600

09:23.633 --> 09:26.900
THEY CALL HER
"CRAZY DOLL GIRL."

09:26.933 --> 09:31.400
I'M "THEY."

09:32.567 --> 09:34.400
- SHE'S IN MY CLASS.

09:34.433 --> 09:38.467
SHE SUPPOSEDLY HAS OVER
500 DOLLS IN HER COLLECTION.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.367
TOTAL WACKO.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.633

- LOOK, PETUNIA PEABODY,
OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS,

10:04.800 --> 10:05.900
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE DOLL BACK.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.400
IT BELONGS TO ME.

10:07.433 --> 10:10.167
BECAUSE I HAVE A RECEIPT

10:10.200 --> 10:11.833
THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.

10:13.367 --> 10:17.133
AU REVOIR.

10:17.167 --> 10:20.400
AAH! SAVE ME!

10:20.433 --> 10:23.167
FRANKIE, HELP ME!

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
NO...

10:30.133 --> 10:31.667

LOUIE'S STUCK

10:31.700 --> 10:33.333
IN MY NURSE TAMMY DOLL?

10:33.367 --> 10:37.267
- MAN, LOUIE WAS POSSESSING
WITHOUT SUPERVISION?

10:37.300 --> 10:38.800
DAD IS GOING TO FREAK.

10:38.833 --> 10:42.433
- DAD IS NOT GONNA FIND OUT.
I PROMISED MY FRIEND.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.267
WE HAVE TO RESCUE HIM
WITHOUT ANY PARENTS KNOWING.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.667
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING
A SECRET MISSION,

10:48.700 --> 10:50.800
COMPLETE WITH MAPS
AND CODE NAMES?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.433
- MILES, NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A--

10:52.467 --> 10:54.033
- YOU'RE T-MONEY,
I'M SABER TOOTH,

10:54.067 --> 10:56.133
AND, FRANKIE,
YOU'RE "THE SCAR."

10:56.167 --> 10:59.033
- I'M KINDA DIGGING THAT.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.100
- CAN WE JUST FOCUS
AND COME UP WITH A PLAN?

11:01.133 --> 11:04.167
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER
TO SAVE TAMMY.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.233
AND LOUIE.
TOTALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM TOO.

11:09.433 --> 11:12.100
- I'M WITH T-MONEY ON THIS.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.533
WE HAVE TO WORK
AS A TEAM.

11:13.567 --> 11:17.800
SO WHAT'S OUR FIRST MOVE?

11:17.833 --> 11:21.700
- GIMME A SEC.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.500
WHEELS TURNING.
- MM-HMM.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.800
PLAN FORMING.
- MM-HMM.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.800
- BRAIN...BRAINING.

11:27.833 --> 11:31.067
- I LOVE IT WHEN SHE GETS
THE CRAZY EYES.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.233
IT REMINDS ME
THAT WE'RE SISTERS.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.767
- I GOT IT.
EVERYBODY IN THE FORT.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.133
- OKAY.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.167
- THIS FORT IS AMAZING.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.267
- EHH, IT'S OKAY.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.733
FLAN?

11:49.767 --> 11:51.400
- NO FLAN!

11:51.433 --> 11:53.533
OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN.

11:53.567 --> 11:55.467
FRANKIE GETS INVITED
TO PENELOPE'S HOUSE

11:55.500 --> 11:56.600
FOR A DOLL TEA PARTY.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.133
BARF!

11:59.167 --> 12:02.467
BUT IT'S FOR LOUIE,
SO I'LL DO IT.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.200
WHILE BARFING.

12:06.367 --> 12:08.800
- ONCE INSIDE,
FRANKIE DISTRACTS PENELOPE

12:08.833 --> 12:11.400
WHILE MILES AND I--

12:11.433 --> 12:15.267
- WHILE SABER TOOTH AND I...

12:15.300 --> 12:16.633
SNEAK IN THE WINDOW,

12:16.667 --> 12:18.567
LOCATE TAMMY,
AND GET HER OUT OF THERE.

12:20.767 --> 12:24.267
- WE'RE BUSTED!
QUICK, EVERYONE PANIC!

12:24.300 --> 12:26.500
YOU IN THERE?

12:26.533 --> 12:29.067
YOU HAVEN'T HELPED OUT
ALL DAY.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.367
NOT THAT THAT'S UNUSUAL,
BUT STILL...

12:31.400 --> 12:33.267
LOUIE

12:33.300 --> 12:35.700
UH...HEY, DAD.

12:35.733 --> 12:38.567
WHAT'S UP?
I'M LOUIE.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.367
JUST HANGING HERE
WITH MILES AND THE GIRLS,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.133
SCRAPBOOKING AND STUFF.

12:44.167 --> 12:48.800
ALSO, I'M LOUIE.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.667
- OH, MY GOSH, RAY.
THEY'RE GETTING ALONG.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.333
LET'S NOT MESS
WITH A GOOD THING.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.067
HAVE FUN, KIDS.

12:54.067 --> 12:56.167
BUT COME HELP OUT
WITH THE SALE WHEN YOU'RE DONE!

12:56.200 --> 12:58.733
BUSINESS IS BOOMIN'!

12:58.767 --> 13:01.300
- BECAUSE SOMEONE IS SELLING
MY FINGERLESS GLOVES

13:01.333 --> 13:04.467
FOR WAY UNDER THE $200
ASKING PRICE.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.133
- OKEYDOKE.

13:07.167 --> 13:10.700
SEE YA LATER,
SAYS LOUIE.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.800
- MILES, THAT'S BRILLIANT.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.333
IF YOU STAY HERE
AND IMITATE US,

13:14.367 --> 13:15.700
OUR PARENTS WILL NEVER
KNOW WE'RE GONE.

13:15.733 --> 13:16.767
- YEAH.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.400
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

13:19.433 --> 13:22.233
I'M A CRUCIAL MEMBER
OF THIS SECRET MISSION TEAM?

13:22.267 --> 13:24.300
- YES, MILES.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.200
- I'M SORRY.
YES, WHO?

13:28.233 --> 13:30.400
- YES, SABER TOOTH.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.600
- TIME TO BUST OUT OF HERE.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.567
YOU IN, SKIPPER SAM?

13:37.600 --> 13:41.800
- I'M BATHTUB SAFE!

13:41.833 --> 13:44.200
- THAT'S THE FOURTH TIME
YOU SAID THAT!

13:44.233 --> 13:47.067
I AM NOT GONNA MISS YOU.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.400
- COMING, DOLLIES.
TEA PARTY TIME.

13:49.433 --> 13:52.267
- OH, MAN.
NOW OR NEVER.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.267
UHH!

13:53.300 --> 13:55.067
OW! MY ANKLE!

13:58.400 --> 14:00.367
MUST GET TO WINDOW.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.367
CAN'T MOVE MY LEG.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.267
UHH...

14:06.700 --> 14:09.133
GUESS I NEED TO CHECK
YOUR BATTERIES.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.733
WHERE'S THAT LATCH?

14:10.767 --> 14:13.700
- AH! COLD HANDS!
WATCH IT.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.067
HEY, HEY!
THAT DOESN'T OPEN.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.533
OH, GOODIE,
MY PLAY DATE IS HERE.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.200
HEE HEE!

14:29.167 --> 14:32.267
- HELLO, PENELOPE.

14:32.300 --> 14:36.267
- WELCOME TO PENELOPE
PRITCHARD'S PLAYHOUSE.

14:36.300 --> 14:40.567
ISN'T IT DOLL

14:40.600 --> 14:43.067
- OH, BOY.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.300
- I DO DECLARE,
FRANKIE HATHAWAY,

14:46.333 --> 14:48.200
I WAS SO SURPRISED TO HEAR

14:48.233 --> 14:51.200
THAT YOU WERE A FELLOW
DOLL LOVER.

14:51.233 --> 14:55.067
'CAUSE PEOPLE
THINK IT'S SO LAME?

14:55.067 --> 14:57.800
DAH--WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THOSE PEOPLE, RIGHT?

14:57.833 --> 15:00.400
THIS DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A ROOM

15:00.433 --> 15:04.133
BELONGING TO A LUNATIC
AT ALL.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.700
- OH, WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

15:05.733 --> 15:08.467
YOU ARE JUST IN TIME
FOR AFTERNOON TEA.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
ALFRED, PLEASE
HELP FRANKIE

15:11.533 --> 15:13.733
WITH HER CHAIR.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.600
- WAIT, ISN'T NURSE TAMMY
GONNA JOIN US?

15:16.633 --> 15:18.300
- OH, FRANKIE.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.733
DON'T BE A SILLY GOOSE.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.733
NURSE TAMMY
CAN'T COME TO TEA.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.300
SHE HAS A DOUBLE SHIFT
AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:26.833 --> 15:30.433
- OF COURSE,
BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.100
HEY, PENNY, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE TEA REFILL?

15:38.133 --> 15:41.467
- OH...RIGHT AWAY!

15:44.600 --> 15:46.100
- I GOT AN IDEA.

15:46.133 --> 15:47.767
TRY POPPING OFF AN ARM.

15:49.367 --> 15:52.333
A LITTLE OUTSIDE THE BOX,
BUT I'M IN.

15:52.367 --> 15:55.167
- THE BALLERINA DOLL!

15:55.200 --> 15:57.100
THEN SHE'LL HAVE
TO GET "NURSE LOUIE."

15:57.133 --> 15:59.133
- OH. I LIKE
THE OTHER WAY BETTER.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.333
UHH! OH, NO!

16:04.367 --> 16:07.300
YOUR BALLERINA DOLL
MUST BE ALLERGIC TO TEA.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.700
HER ARM FELL OFF!

16:09.733 --> 16:12.167
WE NEED NURSE, STAT.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.400
- I'LL GET THE NURSE.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.567
YOU STAY
BY THE PATIENT'S SIDE

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
AND KEEP HER CALM.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.467
- WOW.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.567
DID SOMEBODY PAGE NURSE...

16:27.600 --> 16:30.733
COCO CROCODILE?

16:30.767 --> 16:33.500
- NO. NOBODY PAGED HER.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.167
HOW MANY NURSES
DO YOU HAVE ON STAFF?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.667
- JUST THIS ROOM
OR THE WHOLE HOUSE?

16:42.233 --> 16:44.633
UH-UH.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.167
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.733
- I STILL HAVE BABY HAIRS
IN THAT BRUSH.

16:48.767 --> 16:51.067
- YOU'RE RIGHT, TAY.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.533
THIS GARAGE SALE
WAS A GREAT IDEA.

16:53.567 --> 16:57.300
OUR PARENTS ARE SO SMART.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.133
- GUYS, IT'S TIME
TO GET DOWNSTAIRS

16:59.167 --> 17:00.533
AND HELP OUT.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.200
- SHH. THE KIDS ARE SAYING
I'M SMART.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.133
- ACTUALLY, THEY SAID
BOTH OF US--

17:05.167 --> 17:07.133
- SHH, SHH.

17:07.167 --> 17:08.133
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:08.167 --> 17:11.200
WE SURE ARE LUCKY KIDS.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.167
YES, NOT EVERYONE'S PARENTS

17:13.200 --> 17:14.800
ARE AS COOL AS OURS.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.100
WE SHOULD TELL THEM THAT
MORE OFTEN.

17:20.633 --> 17:22.333
I WISH
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL,

17:22.367 --> 17:26.500
JUST SO I COULD
HANG OUT WITH MY MOM.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.067
- I BETTER CHECK FRANKIE
FOR A FEVER.

17:30.267 --> 17:32.333
HA HA. FOOLED YOU GUYS.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.767
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH MY MOM.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.733
- OKAY, SHE'S FINE.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.333
- WELL, SINCE THEY'RE
PLAYING NICELY,

17:41.367 --> 17:42.667
WE SHOULD LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.067
- HM.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.700
GREAT WORK, MILES.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.600
HOW 'BOUT A HUG?

17:50.633 --> 17:52.700
I'D LIKE THAT.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.200
- HOLD ON, TINA TUTU!

17:57.233 --> 18:00.267
YOU WILL DANCE AGAIN.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.267
SCALPEL.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.700
- I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
ALIVE, AM I?

18:08.700 --> 18:12.133
- YEAH, I'M HERE
TO SAVE TAMMY!

18:12.167 --> 18:14.233
I MEAN YOU, HEH.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.667
UH, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.600
- DOCTOR! THE PATIENT'S
FLAT-LINING.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.633
- OH! YOU'RE
REALLY GETTING INTO THIS.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.200
WHAT NOW, DR. FRANKIE?

18:27.233 --> 18:28.733
- UM...

18:28.767 --> 18:31.667
WE NEED A PLUNGER.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.067
- FOCUS, WOMAN.

18:35.100 --> 18:39.067
DO YOU WANT TO QUESTION ME
OR SAVE LIVES?

18:39.067 --> 18:40.667
- SORRY ABOUT YOUR DOLL.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.800
I WAS PRACTICING
A GHOSTING SKILL,

18:42.833 --> 18:46.133
BUT, LIKE ALWAYS,
I JUST MESSED IT UP.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.833
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.200
- ACTUALLY, I KIND OF DO.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.067
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LAMPS I BROKE

18:53.067 --> 18:55.067
LEARNING BACK HANDSPRINGS
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.067
TONS.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.667
- I CAN'T BE MAD AT SOMEONE
FOR PRACTICING.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.133
NOW, COME ON, LOUIE.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.400
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF THERE.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.867
- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.333
FACE IT, TAYLOR.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.267
IT'S HOPELESS.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.433
- HEY...WHERE'S THE GUY
WHO ALWAYS TELLS US

19:10.467 --> 19:12.200
HE'S THE GREATEST GHOST
EVER?

19:12.233 --> 19:14.633
THE GUY WHO'S ALWAYS
SCREAMING IN MY BATHROOM.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.533
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE
WHO YOU ARE.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.200
YOU NEED TO DECIDE--

19:19.233 --> 19:20.833
ARE YOU AN AWESOME GHOST

19:20.867 --> 19:23.533
OR A NURSE IN A DRESS?

19:25.333 --> 19:28.367
I...AM NOT...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.100
A NURSE!

19:30.133 --> 19:32.767
- YOU'RE DOING IT!

19:32.800 --> 19:34.200
ALMOST THERE...

19:34.233 --> 19:35.767
- NOW JUMP OUT!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.500
- IT'S LOUIE TIME!

19:38.533 --> 19:40.700
RAH!

19:40.733 --> 19:43.267
I DID IT!
OH, YEAH.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.700
* NOW TAKE A LOOK
AT ME, Y'ALL *

19:45.733 --> 19:48.100
* I JUST JUMPED RIGHT OUT
OF THIS DOLL *

19:48.133 --> 19:50.133
* AND NOW I'M DONE
WITH ALL THIS GLITTER *

19:50.167 --> 19:52.633
* 'CAUSE I'M A SCARY GHOST,
AND I AIN'T NO QUITTER *

19:52.667 --> 19:54.867
I'M LOUIE.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.733
- IF YOU'RE DONE,
I COULD USE SOME HELP.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.467
- WE'RE COMING, TINA TUTU!
- HURRY, HURRY.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.633
- WAIT, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR TAMMY DOLL?

20:05.667 --> 20:07.200
- LEAVE IT.

20:07.233 --> 20:08.700
GETTING YOU BACK
IS ALL THAT REALLY MATTERED.

20:08.733 --> 20:12.200
- YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF
A TEAM LOUIE T-SHIRT.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REMEMBERED?

20:22.467 --> 20:23.567
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.600
AU REVOIR!

20:27.500 --> 20:29.600
- WHAT A WEIRDO.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.600
LEMON JUICE CAN'T GET
A STAIN OUT OF CASHMERE.

20:38.633 --> 20:40.633
BUT IT SURE IS
FUN TO TRY!

20:43.033 --> 20:45.033
OH, MILES.

20:45.067 --> 20:47.067
LOL, BRO.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.600
ZINGER!

20:50.733 --> 20:54.933
MY PLAN WORKED PERFECT.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.333
HELLO, PARENTS.

20:59.733 --> 21:02.067
- I THINK I KNOW.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.500
- HELLO, PARENTS.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.433
FLAN?

21:12.133 --> 21:15.367
- YOU'RE UP, T-MONEY.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.700
- UM, SO, LONG STORY SHORT,

21:18.733 --> 21:20.433
LOUIE GOT STUCK
IN SPARKLE BEAR,

21:20.467 --> 21:22.133
SECRET RESCUE MISSION,
CRAZY DOLL GIRL,

21:22.167 --> 21:24.067
BALLERINA OPERATION,
TRAPPED IN A WINDOW.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.767
LOUIE JUMPED OUT OF THE DOLL.
BACK SAFELY!

21:26.800 --> 21:29.067
- YEAH.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.767
THAT ALL MADE SENSE TO ME.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.500
- SON, WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT POSSESSING

21:34.533 --> 21:35.767
WHEN I'M NOT AROUND?

21:35.800 --> 21:39.200
- UM, I THINK
IT WAS NOT TO.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.333
WELL, I HOPE YOU KIDS
REALLY DO LIKE

21:43.367 --> 21:44.967
SPENDING TIME TOGETHER,
BECAUSE,

21:45.067 --> 21:46.567
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS...
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.200
- YOU'RE GROUNDED.

21:48.233 --> 21:50.067
THAT MEANS NO TV.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.500
- AND NO THROWING MUD BALLS
OVER THE BACK FENCE

21:53.533 --> 21:55.200
AND YELLING, "BROWN RAIN."

21:57.467 --> 21:59.500
- HEY...

21:59.533 --> 22:02.533
FIRST FAMILY PUNISHMENT.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.733
EVERYONE SAY, "BUSTED!"

22:04.767 --> 22:07.200
all: BUSTED!
