00:07.061 --> 00:08.358
Hello.

00:08.395 --> 00:11.159
Hi, uh, Mrs. Pruit,
it's Valerie again.

00:11.198 --> 00:13.359
Um, has Ray gotten back, yet?

00:13.400 --> 00:14.765
Oh, hi, Valerie.

00:14.802 --> 00:15.860
Hi.

00:15.903 --> 00:17.962
l think you may've
just missed him, honey.

00:18.005 --> 00:19.029
Just let me check.

00:19.073 --> 00:19.937
Thank you.

00:19.974 --> 00:21.771
You sure picked yourself
a doozy.

00:21.809 --> 00:23.174
Just tell her l'm not home.

00:24.979 --> 00:27.004
Sorry, honey,
he just pulled out.

00:27.047 --> 00:29.311
Has he been getting my messages?

00:29.350 --> 00:30.749
Every last one.

00:31.919 --> 00:33.682
Hold on just a second.

00:33.721 --> 00:36.053
Can you tell him that l called

00:36.090 --> 00:38.388
and it's very important
that he gets back to me?

00:38.425 --> 00:40.393
l sure will.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:51.071 --> 00:53.335
Mr. Sanders, come on in.

00:53.374 --> 00:54.568
Hello, Val.

00:54.642 --> 00:56.109
Why don't you call me Rush?

00:56.143 --> 01:00.136
Okay, Rush, come on in.

01:02.516 --> 01:04.780
Wow, quite a dorm
you got here.

01:04.818 --> 01:06.410
Thank you.

01:06.453 --> 01:07.681
Can l offer you a drink?

01:07.721 --> 01:08.688
Whatever you're having.

01:08.722 --> 01:11.350
Shirley Temple?
Hardly.

01:11.392 --> 01:12.916
Okay, l'll have a scotch
on the rocks.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.053
Coming right up.

01:17.898 --> 01:20.389
Well, tell me,
what's on your mind?

01:20.434 --> 01:23.961
l just thought we ought
to get to know each other

01:24.004 --> 01:24.732
a little better.

01:24.772 --> 01:26.831
Really?

01:26.874 --> 01:28.671
For what possible reason?

01:28.709 --> 01:30.904
Does there have to be a reason?

01:32.813 --> 01:35.907
Valerie, honey, l'm old enough
to be your father.

01:35.949 --> 01:38.645
And l'm sure a young lady
like you doesn't get too lonely

01:38.686 --> 01:39.778
on cold winter nights.

01:41.889 --> 01:45.052
Okay, l'll be honest with you.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.921
You have something l want.

01:47.961 --> 01:50.429
Ah, what is that?

01:50.464 --> 01:52.659
The Peach Pit After Dark.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.725
l want to take it
off your hands.

01:57.004 --> 01:58.096
You?

02:02.342 --> 02:03.741
l'm sorry, it's not for sale.

02:03.777 --> 02:05.472
Oh, come on.

02:05.512 --> 02:07.207
l've heard everything
is for sale.

02:07.247 --> 02:08.110
ls that so?

02:11.685 --> 02:15.314
Actually, everything
is negotiable.

02:15.355 --> 02:17.186
Okay...

02:18.692 --> 02:21.752
then let's negotiate.

04:09.036 --> 04:10.503
How much further?

04:10.537 --> 04:13.005
Why are you asking me
so many fool questions?

04:13.040 --> 04:14.439
Don't you trust me?

04:14.474 --> 04:16.499
Shh, they're here.

04:16.610 --> 04:17.702
ls that Donna's voice

04:17.744 --> 04:20.736
-l just heard?
-Yes, it is.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.373
Surprise!

04:22.416 --> 04:23.383
What's going on here?

04:23.417 --> 04:24.384
Well, just a little party

04:24.418 --> 04:25.715
to welcome you back
to the real world.

04:25.752 --> 04:27.310
Yeah, we thought
we'd lost you forever.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.981
Yeah, you almost did.

04:29.022 --> 04:31.957
But never underestimate
the power of love.

04:31.992 --> 04:32.856
Uh-oh.

04:32.893 --> 04:34.417
Welcome back, Kel.

04:34.461 --> 04:37.521
l should be saying
the same thing to you.

04:37.564 --> 04:40.226
lt's been a long time since
you've set foot on this campus.

04:40.267 --> 04:42.292
Yeah, it must've been
a different lifetime.

04:42.336 --> 04:44.964
l'm glad you're here.

04:45.005 --> 04:47.371
Me, too.

04:47.407 --> 04:49.534
Come on, guys, let's eat up.

04:49.576 --> 04:51.066
We gotta get back to class.

04:51.111 --> 04:54.547
Well, l hate to not eat
and run, but l got to go.

04:54.615 --> 04:56.640
Donna, Donna,
Kelly just got here.

04:56.683 --> 04:57.911
Sorry, Kel.

04:57.951 --> 04:59.543
l told Ray l'd meet him
at the club

04:59.586 --> 05:01.383
to have a quick sound check--
catch you at home?

05:01.421 --> 05:04.447
Okay.
Thanks, for everything.

05:04.491 --> 05:06.015
You know what, Donna?

05:06.059 --> 05:07.048
l need a ride somewhere.

05:07.094 --> 05:08.152
-Can you take me?
-Let's go.

05:08.195 --> 05:09.423
-Thanks.
-Later, Chief.

05:09.463 --> 05:13.126
l think Donna's joined her own
cult, the Ray Pruit Society.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.997
David, did you leave your bike
parked on the rack at the dorm?

05:15.035 --> 05:16.502
No, ma'am, l don't own a bike.

05:16.603 --> 05:19.003
Lucky for you, 'cause no one
else does now either.

05:19.039 --> 05:19.835
What happened?

05:19.873 --> 05:21.238
Someone stole four bikes
this morning,

05:21.275 --> 05:22.936
including mine,
a brand new Lite Speed.

05:22.976 --> 05:24.204
Ouch.

05:24.244 --> 05:25.734
Whoever it was knew
what they were after.

05:25.779 --> 05:26.905
Took all the good ones
and left the junk.

05:26.947 --> 05:29.415
Did you tell campus security?

05:29.449 --> 05:31.349
Like that's gonna do any good.

05:31.385 --> 05:33.546
Talking to campus security is
like dealing with Barney Fife.

05:34.721 --> 05:36.416
Better watch out, Mr. President.

05:36.456 --> 05:38.014
They're gonna say
you're soft on crime.

05:39.793 --> 05:44.423
The only thing around here
l'm soft on is you.

05:45.132 --> 05:46.429
-Oh...
-Aw...

06:01.114 --> 06:03.275
Don't you believe in knocking?

06:03.317 --> 06:05.683
Don't you believe
in returning phone calls?

06:05.719 --> 06:07.050
Don't take it personally, Val.

06:07.087 --> 06:08.714
How am l supposed
to take it, Ray?

06:08.755 --> 06:10.916
Luckily, l have
a forgiving nature

06:10.958 --> 06:12.687
and a positive mental attitude.

06:12.726 --> 06:15.320
Why don't you take your positive
mental attitude out the door?

06:15.362 --> 06:17.728
You know, you're really burying
yourself, Ray.

06:17.764 --> 06:19.026
Oh, is that what l'm doing?

06:19.066 --> 06:21.398
lt would be in your best
interest to start treating me

06:21.435 --> 06:22.663
with a little more respect.

06:23.870 --> 06:25.497
Dinner.

06:25.572 --> 06:28.166
-Val, hi.
-Hey.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.472
l, uh, just dropped by
to say hi to our guy.

06:30.510 --> 06:32.137
Well, please stay.
l have enough for three.

06:32.179 --> 06:33.510
Uh, no, you guys go ahead.

06:33.613 --> 06:35.205
Bon appetit.

06:35.248 --> 06:38.513
Bye.

06:38.552 --> 06:40.486
So, what'd she mean
by ''our guy''?

06:40.520 --> 06:41.953
Who knows?

06:41.989 --> 06:43.752
You can't take anything
she says seriously.

06:43.790 --> 06:46.350
Well, l like her.

06:46.393 --> 06:47.451
She's got style.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.155
Mm...

06:57.604 --> 07:00.038
l just talked
to my parents.

07:00.073 --> 07:01.597
My bike was covered
on their insurance,

07:01.641 --> 07:03.472
but they won't buy me
another one.

07:03.577 --> 07:04.703
Can you believe that?

07:04.745 --> 07:07.737
Anyone who rides a bike worth
more than the GNP of Bora Bora

07:07.781 --> 07:09.715
is asking to have it ripped off.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.116
Gee, Lenny, don't be sympathetic
or anything.

07:12.152 --> 07:13.779
l'm used to it.

07:13.820 --> 07:15.481
You're up, Ziminski.

07:15.589 --> 07:17.523
l was born ''up,'' son.

07:23.363 --> 07:24.489
Oh, man...

07:24.531 --> 07:26.192
Good shot. You win. Let's go.

07:26.233 --> 07:27.723
No, no. We're playing best
two-out-of-three, Clare.

07:27.768 --> 07:29.929
Hey, you better settle in
for the long haul, Clare.

07:29.970 --> 07:31.835
At least let me change
your CD, all right?

07:31.872 --> 07:33.271
Uh, it's not a CD.
lt's vinyl.

07:33.306 --> 07:34.500
Whatever.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.803
Don't touch the turntable.
l'll do it.

07:42.749 --> 07:45.479
Captain Beefheart?!

07:45.519 --> 07:47.749
Put that back...

07:47.788 --> 07:49.483
in alphabetical order, please.

07:49.523 --> 07:51.047
Sorry.

07:51.091 --> 07:54.822
Does it, uh, go under
the C's or the B's?

07:54.861 --> 07:56.453
lt's a cool collection, huh?

07:56.496 --> 07:58.896
Yeah, it's groovy.

07:58.932 --> 08:00.524
Man, check this out.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.659
Analog is where it's at.

08:01.701 --> 08:03.896
Yeah, well,
it's not just me.

08:03.937 --> 08:05.802
Pearl Jam issues
everything on vinyl.

08:05.839 --> 08:07.306
Have a good game, guys.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.807
l'm out of here.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.707
Clare, Clare,
why are you leaving?

08:14.748 --> 08:16.010
You just got here.

08:16.049 --> 08:18.347
l'm glad you've met some
new friends in the dorm,

08:18.385 --> 08:20.717
but this guy is
tres weird, okay?

08:20.754 --> 08:23.723
Oh, come on. l'm weird.
You're weird. Everybody's weird.

08:23.757 --> 08:25.224
Speak for yourself.

08:25.258 --> 08:26.725
Au revoir.

08:30.130 --> 08:31.722
Hope it was nothing l said.

08:31.765 --> 08:34.563
No, she just gets moody
sometimes. Let's play.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.268
Wendy, you got anything for me?

08:43.309 --> 08:45.608
Enough blood
for an army of vampires.

08:45.645 --> 08:48.637
Mmm, yum. Thank you.

08:48.682 --> 08:50.912
l see you in that
lab coat and l swoon.

08:50.951 --> 08:51.940
Will you stop it?

08:51.985 --> 08:54.078
l need you
right here right now.

08:54.121 --> 08:55.520
Right in front of Wendy?

08:55.589 --> 08:56.886
Oh, she'll love it.

08:56.923 --> 08:59.721
You're nuts.

08:59.759 --> 09:00.885
You're crazy.

09:00.927 --> 09:02.121
Hey, give me a break.

09:02.162 --> 09:03.459
l've been on
for 16 hours.

09:03.497 --> 09:05.692
l'm delirious,
not to mention horny.

09:05.732 --> 09:07.290
Well, then take
a cold shower.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.962
How 'bout if l make it hot
and you join me?

09:10.003 --> 09:12.028
Look, you're working
and l'm working.

09:12.072 --> 09:13.562
Technically,
that's not the case.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.234
My break began
two minutes ago.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.299
What are you doing?

09:16.343 --> 09:17.605
Come into my laboratory.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.475
What are you doing?!

09:21.982 --> 09:23.449
What are you doing?

09:23.483 --> 09:24.381
Shh-shh.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.282
Oh, l love this job.

09:26.319 --> 09:28.446
-You do?
-Mm, l do.

09:31.558 --> 09:32.786
Mm...

09:45.238 --> 09:46.637
Andrea?

09:46.673 --> 09:47.799
Are you in here?

09:47.841 --> 09:49.502
Uh, there's nobody
in here but me,

09:49.543 --> 09:51.306
and l'm not dressed,

09:51.344 --> 09:52.902
so if you don't want
an eyeful...

09:52.946 --> 09:55.039
Oh, boy. Sorry.

09:55.081 --> 09:57.242
That's okay.

09:59.186 --> 10:01.017
That was too close
for comfort.

10:01.054 --> 10:03.045
We can't be doing that
here anymore.

10:03.089 --> 10:06.388
No, we just can't
do that here anymore.

10:11.064 --> 10:14.625
Folks, if l could just have your
attention for a moment please.

10:14.668 --> 10:16.533
l have a brief
announcement to make.

10:16.636 --> 10:20.197
As of, uh...
5:00 this afternoon,

10:20.240 --> 10:22.504
the Peach Pit After Dark is

10:22.542 --> 10:24.237
under new proprietorship.

10:25.579 --> 10:27.877
Uh, it is with great pleasure
that l introduce you

10:27.914 --> 10:29.313
to the new owner,
who promises me

10:29.349 --> 10:32.011
that the good times
will continue to roll.

10:32.052 --> 10:33.986
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Valerie Malone.

10:38.825 --> 10:41.555
Thank you, very much.

10:41.661 --> 10:43.891
Well, l'm really excited
about this.

10:43.930 --> 10:45.830
lt's gonna be
a great challenge for me.

10:45.865 --> 10:48.060
So let's turn up the music
and we'll see you later.

10:48.101 --> 10:50.092
Have a good time.

10:57.143 --> 10:59.976
l didn't know Valerie
was interested in business.

11:01.248 --> 11:03.512
Do you think she's
dropping out of school?

11:03.550 --> 11:06.314
She didn't tell you
anything about this, did she?

11:06.353 --> 11:08.321
-No.
-Hmm.

11:12.892 --> 11:15.952
l know you guys must
have a million questions.

11:15.996 --> 11:17.054
l would have told you sooner,

11:17.097 --> 11:19.031
but it all came down
so suddenly.

11:19.065 --> 11:20.259
lsn't it great?!

11:20.300 --> 11:22.291
What do you know about
running a nightclub, Val?

11:22.335 --> 11:23.529
Not a thing, but...

11:23.637 --> 11:25.537
l'm willing to work hard
and learn.

11:25.572 --> 11:26.664
And that's a start, right?

11:26.706 --> 11:28.731
Well, l think it's terrific.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.402
l'm very happy for you.
Congratulations.

11:30.443 --> 11:31.535
Thanks, Donna.

11:31.645 --> 11:32.737
l knew l could count on you.

11:53.633 --> 11:55.624
Hold on.

12:02.609 --> 12:04.509
What?

12:04.611 --> 12:06.169
l want to celebrate.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.543
Celebrate what?

12:08.581 --> 12:10.913
l just made an acquisition.

12:10.950 --> 12:13.145
What did you acquire?

12:13.186 --> 12:16.519
-Hmm?
-l bought Steve's father's share

12:16.556 --> 12:18.524
of the Peach Pit After Dark.

12:18.591 --> 12:20.286
So now l know you're crazy.
Come on.

12:20.327 --> 12:23.091
-Go.
-Well, it runs in the family.

12:23.129 --> 12:25.620
But look what l scored.

12:26.733 --> 12:28.758
Fresh... Humboldt County pot.

12:28.802 --> 12:30.633
Oh, take a whiff of that.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.433
Yeah, no thanks.

12:32.472 --> 12:33.905
Come on, Dylan.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.840
Let's smoke ourselves silly

12:35.875 --> 12:36.933
and make love all night.

12:36.976 --> 12:39.467
You're already silly, l'll pass.

12:39.512 --> 12:41.275
On me or the pot?

12:41.314 --> 12:42.508
Both.

12:42.549 --> 12:43.607
What's gotten into you?

12:45.251 --> 12:48.550
Oh, that's right.

12:48.588 --> 12:50.556
You're stuck on Kelly.

12:50.590 --> 12:53.559
But you have to admit,
l'm not bad for backup.

12:53.660 --> 12:54.991
Good night, Val.

12:55.028 --> 12:56.962
Come on, Dylan.

12:56.996 --> 12:58.395
Don't make me go.

12:58.431 --> 12:59.523
l feel so good.

12:59.566 --> 13:01.227
l just want to share it
with somebody.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.201
Somebody else.

13:04.237 --> 13:05.898
l don't have anybody else.

13:05.939 --> 13:08.931
Are you telling me
it's lonely at the top?

13:12.379 --> 13:14.040
Okay, l get the message.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.638
l'll go.

13:18.051 --> 13:20.042
Sleep tight.

13:30.630 --> 13:32.689
lt definitely looks
like Beverly Hills

13:32.732 --> 13:33.926
has gone to our
Valerie's head.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.525
Maybe she's just
lost her mind.

13:35.635 --> 13:37.125
Maybe we should call Abby.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.104
l don't think
Abby swings much weight

13:39.139 --> 13:40.436
with her daughter
these days, Mom.

13:40.473 --> 13:42.805
Well, l'm sure
you're right, but...

13:42.842 --> 13:44.309
l mean, with all that money,

13:44.344 --> 13:46.107
you'd think she'd send some
of it home to her family.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.377
We should do something.

13:51.418 --> 13:53.978
Well, honey, it's her money,
she's on her own.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.351
l don't think
there's much we can do.

13:55.388 --> 13:57.185
l know.

13:57.223 --> 13:58.986
l don't just want to see her
get in any trouble.

13:59.025 --> 14:00.652
Believe me,
first sign of trouble,

14:00.693 --> 14:02.752
she'll be on our porch faster
than you can snap

14:02.796 --> 14:04.457
-your fingers.
-Yeah.

14:05.698 --> 14:06.926
Hello?

14:06.966 --> 14:08.490
-Brandon.
-Oh, hey, Steve.

14:08.568 --> 14:10.934
We were just talking about
your best friend, Miss Valerie.

14:10.970 --> 14:12.301
Don't go there, Brandon.

14:12.338 --> 14:13.805
You talk to your dad?

14:13.840 --> 14:15.330
Yeah, l spoke to him.
We're going to have lunch today.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.706
But that's not the reason
l'm calling.

14:16.743 --> 14:17.732
What's going on?

14:17.777 --> 14:18.971
Well, l hate to ruin
your morning,

14:19.012 --> 14:20.240
but l thought you should know.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.804
Three frat houses
got hit last night.

14:21.848 --> 14:23.042
So why are you telling me?

14:23.082 --> 14:24.413
You're the president.

14:24.451 --> 14:26.783
You're supposed to do something
about this crime wave.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.788
Well, what am l supposed to do?

14:28.822 --> 14:30.187
Call out the National Guard?

14:30.223 --> 14:31.747
Hey, pal, you're the one

14:31.791 --> 14:33.452
who's supposed to have
the answers, not me.

15:01.154 --> 15:02.917
What time did Valerie
say to meet her?

15:02.956 --> 15:05.220
Hmm, 1 1 :00.

15:05.258 --> 15:07.055
Why? ls that a problem?

15:07.093 --> 15:08.321
No, l can make it.

15:08.361 --> 15:09.794
l just can't imagine
what it's going to be like

15:09.829 --> 15:11.694
booking bands with her.

15:11.731 --> 15:13.596
lf we can work
with Rush Sanders,

15:13.633 --> 15:16.727
l think we can probably
work with anyone.

15:16.769 --> 15:18.236
Bye.

15:25.445 --> 15:26.810
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

15:26.846 --> 15:28.507
l just wanted
to return David's notes.

15:28.581 --> 15:30.276
Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in.

15:30.316 --> 15:32.784
Yeah, actually
l was just leaving.

15:32.819 --> 15:34.787
Not on account of me, l hope.

15:34.821 --> 15:36.152
l have a class.

15:36.189 --> 15:37.383
Don't flatter yourself.

15:40.793 --> 15:43.318
Your girlfriend sure goes
out of her way to avoid me.

15:43.363 --> 15:44.796
Oh, no, don't worry
about it, man.

15:44.831 --> 15:46.298
She's just not
a morning person.

15:46.332 --> 15:47.629
Eh, it's okay.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.532
lt's not like she's the only one
around here who doesn't like me.

15:49.569 --> 15:50.797
Come on, what are you
talking about?

15:50.837 --> 15:51.963
Come on, David.

15:52.005 --> 15:53.438
Compared to all you guys,
l'm an old man.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.199
You know, l don't understand
why you moved in the dorms.

15:57.243 --> 15:58.904
l would've figured you
for, uh...

15:58.945 --> 16:00.173
l don't know,
apartment off campus

16:00.213 --> 16:02.443
-or something?
-Can't afford it.

16:02.482 --> 16:03.847
But you were in the army.

16:03.883 --> 16:05.282
Don't you get any Gl benefits

16:05.318 --> 16:06.717
-or anything?
-No.

16:06.753 --> 16:08.414
Why not?

16:08.454 --> 16:11.218
lt's a long story.

16:11.257 --> 16:12.588
The upshot is,

16:12.625 --> 16:15.355
l've got to beg, borrow
and steal to make ends meet.

16:15.395 --> 16:17.659
Yeah, well, l wouldn't say that
too loud around here

16:17.697 --> 16:18.994
with all those bikes missing.

16:19.032 --> 16:21.091
What kind of a crack is that?

16:21.134 --> 16:23.125
lt was just a joke.

16:23.169 --> 16:24.363
Well, it's not funny.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.505
Lenny, l was,
l was just kidding.

16:30.543 --> 16:31.874
Yeah, right.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.052
Oh, yeah? How's Hannah?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.280
Finally asleep.

16:41.321 --> 16:42.879
l thought l'd never
get her down for a nap.

16:42.922 --> 16:45.015
Jesse, she has been like this
ever since you left town.

16:45.058 --> 16:47.219
And how about her mom?

16:47.260 --> 16:48.454
You having trouble
sleeping, too?

16:48.494 --> 16:49.620
Me, definitely.

16:49.662 --> 16:52.654
l toss and turn all night long.

16:52.699 --> 16:54.291
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better,

16:54.334 --> 16:57.497
given how great my interview
went with Judge Costello today,

16:57.537 --> 16:59.437
it looks like Boise
may be out of the running.

16:59.472 --> 17:01.940
Jesse, l hate
to break it to you,

17:01.975 --> 17:04.704
but Kansas City doesn't sound
much more thrilling than Boise.

17:04.743 --> 17:06.268
Well, the steaks are great.

17:06.311 --> 17:09.440
And when was the last time
you saw me eat red meat?

17:10.516 --> 17:11.847
Somebody's at the door, hold on.

17:14.454 --> 17:15.182
Surprise.

17:15.221 --> 17:16.915
Shh!

17:16.955 --> 17:18.320
Who's that?

17:18.358 --> 17:20.053
Uh, it's, uh,
my grandmother.

17:20.093 --> 17:21.151
Grandmother?

17:21.194 --> 17:22.627
Oh, give her my love, would you?

17:22.662 --> 17:24.630
Jesse sends
his love, Grandma.

17:24.664 --> 17:25.925
You know what, honey?

17:25.964 --> 17:28.455
Um, maybe l should
call you back.

17:28.501 --> 17:30.935
Uh, you know what? l'm going
to be running around all day.

17:30.970 --> 17:33.029
Why don't l give you a call
before l go to bed, all right?

17:33.072 --> 17:34.972
Great.

17:35.008 --> 17:36.100
l love you.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.609
Yeah, and me, too.

17:37.644 --> 17:39.805
Bye.

17:39.846 --> 17:41.211
Hubby in Boise again?

17:41.247 --> 17:42.874
No, Kansas City.

17:42.915 --> 17:45.213
Oh, well, l hear everything's
up to date there.

17:45.251 --> 17:47.481
Peter, l asked you
not to come by here.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.454
What if-- what if Jesse
were here?

17:49.489 --> 17:51.184
Or my parents
or my grandmother?

17:51.224 --> 17:53.715
Wait a minute, l thought l was
your grandmother.

17:55.395 --> 17:57.488
Look, stop kidding around, okay?

17:57.530 --> 17:59.361
l mean, this thing makes me
just too nervous.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.026
You've got to go.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.967
l will. l promise.

18:03.002 --> 18:04.299
Just not yet.

18:07.006 --> 18:09.907
Mm...

18:13.012 --> 18:15.480
Oh, l must be crazy.

18:15.515 --> 18:18.006
My daughter's sleeping
in the next room.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.482
You're not crazy.

18:20.553 --> 18:23.647
You just can't keep
your hands off me.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.488
What are we going to do?

18:26.526 --> 18:28.323
We'll figure something out.

18:28.361 --> 18:29.658
You're working tonight, right?

18:29.696 --> 18:31.664
Yes, 5:00 to 7:00,

18:31.698 --> 18:34.223
and you better behave
yourself, promise?

18:34.267 --> 18:36.997
Sorry, that l cannot promise.

18:37.036 --> 18:38.526
Come here.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.477
Hey, Nat.

18:50.516 --> 18:51.608
You seen
your new partner around?

18:51.651 --> 18:54.347
Yeah, she's next door,
redecorating.

18:54.387 --> 18:55.752
She doesn't waste any time, huh?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.786
Tell her to bring
back my hammer.

19:00.827 --> 19:02.818
Will do.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.627
lt is my hammer.

19:13.172 --> 19:14.799
lnstalling a new
dart board, huh?

19:14.841 --> 19:16.468
First big
management decision?

19:16.542 --> 19:18.567
Yeah.

19:18.611 --> 19:20.476
What do you think?

19:20.546 --> 19:21.843
Well, l can think
of a few faces

19:21.881 --> 19:23.576
l wouldn't mind
pinning up there.

19:25.618 --> 19:27.813
Be my guest.

19:28.855 --> 19:30.322
So my mother said
you called.

19:30.356 --> 19:32.381
Lordy have mercy.

19:32.425 --> 19:34.893
She finally gave you
a message, huh?

19:34.927 --> 19:36.519
What do you want,
Valerie?

19:38.030 --> 19:40.464
We have some unfinished
business to discuss.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.764
l think l already
know the terms.

19:42.802 --> 19:43.928
l'm not interested.

19:43.970 --> 19:46.495
Look, Ray,

19:46.539 --> 19:48.973
personally, l'd
like nothing better

19:49.008 --> 19:50.373
than for you to continue
playing here.

19:50.409 --> 19:52.843
Said the spider to the fly.

19:52.879 --> 19:55.177
ls my web so unpleasant?

19:57.216 --> 19:59.514
What's the matter, Ray?

19:59.552 --> 20:01.850
l mean, don't you
like the success?

20:01.888 --> 20:04.755
Hundreds of adoring
fans out in the crowd.

20:04.791 --> 20:08.818
And that one, especially one
adoring fan backstage?

20:08.861 --> 20:11.056
lt's not worth
the price, Valerie.

20:11.097 --> 20:12.621
l can't lie to Donna.

20:12.665 --> 20:14.496
You already have.

20:15.735 --> 20:17.430
What do you want Valerie?
Spell it out.

20:17.470 --> 20:21.406
How can l make it
clearer to you?

20:21.440 --> 20:23.135
l want you back in my bed.

20:24.343 --> 20:25.742
And if l don't,
then you're going

20:25.778 --> 20:27.473
to go tell, Donna, right?
ls that the deal?

20:27.513 --> 20:30.073
No. Why would l
want to hurt Donna?

20:30.116 --> 20:31.242
She's one of my best friends.

20:31.284 --> 20:32.979
But if we don't pick up
where we left off,

20:33.019 --> 20:34.680
then l'm never going
to work here again, huh?

20:34.720 --> 20:36.847
You know people overestimate

20:36.889 --> 20:38.618
the value of a
college education.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.022
You're much smarter
than l thought.

20:42.061 --> 20:44.825
And you're far more vicious.

21:00.947 --> 21:02.141
Don't get me wrong, guys.

21:02.181 --> 21:04.012
l think Ray's music
is very solid

21:04.050 --> 21:05.950
and his band has a
hardworking sound, but...

21:05.985 --> 21:07.850
don't you think it's time to get
some new blood around here?

21:07.887 --> 21:10.321
See, l couldn't agree
with you more.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.380
David!

21:11.424 --> 21:13.085
lt's not like l want to ace
the guy out of anything,

21:13.125 --> 21:14.888
but l don't know, l just think
there's a lot of great

21:14.927 --> 21:16.189
bands out there that
deserve a shot.

21:16.229 --> 21:17.787
My sentiments exactly.

21:17.830 --> 21:19.855
Are you not going to let Ray
play at all anymore?

21:19.899 --> 21:21.730
Well, we'll see,
but in the meantime,

21:21.767 --> 21:22.756
l'd like a proposed schedule

21:22.802 --> 21:24.292
of the bookings
for the next two months.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.396
You know, to publish
a calendar.

21:26.439 --> 21:27.531
ls that a problem?

21:27.640 --> 21:29.301
lt's no problem at all.

21:29.342 --> 21:31.367
Just give us a couple days,
we'll get everything together.

21:31.410 --> 21:34.038
That's what l wanted to hear.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.672
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:01.274 --> 22:02.605
Hi, son.
How're you doing?

22:02.642 --> 22:04.837
Don't ''hi, son'' me okay?

22:04.877 --> 22:07.243
l can see you are
your usual charming self.

22:09.115 --> 22:10.707
Scotch on the rocks,
how about you?

22:10.750 --> 22:12.809
l'm not hungry.
Thank you.

22:14.153 --> 22:15.882
l, on the other hand,
am starved.

22:15.922 --> 22:18.789
So l think l'm going to have
a New York Strip medium rare,

22:18.824 --> 22:20.792
baked potato, sour cream

22:20.826 --> 22:22.521
and some of those
sauteed mushrooms,

22:22.561 --> 22:23.960
the whole nine yards.
What do you say?

22:23.996 --> 22:25.588
l said l'm not hungry, okay?

22:27.633 --> 22:29.123
l can see you're
not too thrilled

22:29.168 --> 22:31.363
about, uh, my selling the club.

22:33.406 --> 22:34.532
Did you sleep with Valerie?

22:34.607 --> 22:36.040
What?

22:36.075 --> 22:37.542
Don't play
dumb with me.

22:37.576 --> 22:39.703
You got

22:39.745 --> 22:41.474
quite an imagination.

22:41.514 --> 22:43.004
Or you got a dirty mind.

22:43.049 --> 22:45.142
How else did she get you
to sell the club, Dad?

22:45.184 --> 22:46.811
How about money?

22:46.852 --> 22:47.978
That's how people usually

22:48.020 --> 22:49.954
do business.

22:49.989 --> 22:52.048
Matter of fact,
this is for you.

22:52.091 --> 22:53.558
Oh, what's that?

22:53.592 --> 22:54.786
That's your commission.

22:54.827 --> 22:57.261
lf l say so myself,
l made a very tasty profit

22:57.296 --> 22:58.957
for a three-month
investment.

22:58.998 --> 23:00.989
-Commission?
-Mm-hmm.

23:05.504 --> 23:06.766
Oh...

23:06.806 --> 23:09.366
uh, this is all for me?

23:09.408 --> 23:10.841
All yours, sonny boy.

23:10.876 --> 23:12.366
lf it wasn't for you,
l never would have

23:12.411 --> 23:14.106
been in that club
in the first place.

23:14.146 --> 23:15.511
Well, thanks.

23:15.614 --> 23:17.013
My pleasure.

23:17.049 --> 23:19.347
You know, maybe l will
have that steak now.

23:19.385 --> 23:20.875
And that Vegas salad.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.444
You know, the one where
the lettuce dances

23:22.488 --> 23:24.456
around the plate in that
lovely vinaigrette sauce.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.583
Waiter, get over here!

24:07.666 --> 24:08.894
She fired him?

24:08.934 --> 24:11.994
l wouldn't say that.

24:12.038 --> 24:14.836
l got the feeling there
were, um...

24:14.874 --> 24:16.102
creative differences.

24:16.142 --> 24:18.770
l thought Valerie liked
Ray's music.

24:18.811 --> 24:20.403
l don't know.

24:20.446 --> 24:23.347
She just called
David and l in,

24:23.382 --> 24:25.509
and told us to start
looking for new bands.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.280
But you guys told her
that Ray's great,

24:27.319 --> 24:28.877
and that's she's crazy
to get rid of him, right?

24:28.921 --> 24:30.286
Yeah, l tried; she
wouldn't listen to me.

24:30.322 --> 24:31.289
What about David?

24:31.323 --> 24:35.589
Um... he, uh...

24:36.629 --> 24:38.187
Stabbed Ray in the back, right?

24:38.230 --> 24:39.629
l wouldn't put it that way.

24:39.665 --> 24:40.689
Oh, l would.

24:42.134 --> 24:44.398
You know it's one thing to hurt
me, but to hurt someone

24:44.437 --> 24:46.803
who's struggling to make
something of himself?

24:46.839 --> 24:47.965
That is so low.

24:49.175 --> 24:50.540
Poor Ray.

24:50.643 --> 24:52.804
He must be feeling really
terrible right now.

25:04.356 --> 25:07.223
Guess the apple doesn't
fall very far from the tree.

25:07.259 --> 25:08.886
What is that
supposed to mean?

25:08.928 --> 25:11.829
Running away, just
like your father.

25:11.864 --> 25:13.229
l am not running away.

25:13.265 --> 25:14.459
l'm getting run out of town.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.797
There's a big
difference.

25:15.835 --> 25:18.429
Oh, some club closes
its door to you,

25:18.471 --> 25:19.904
and you're ready
to head for the hills?

25:19.939 --> 25:21.133
Look, l got a booking agent

25:21.173 --> 25:23.073
setting up gigs
in colleges all over

25:23.109 --> 25:24.770
the Northwest.

25:24.810 --> 25:27.301
Besides, out of sight is
out of mind, and right now

25:27.346 --> 25:28.506
that's probably
my best bet.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.605
And what about Donna?

25:32.685 --> 25:35.017
l love Donna.

25:35.054 --> 25:36.521
But l don't want to hurt her.

25:36.589 --> 25:38.614
But you're going to sneak out
of town without telling her?

25:38.657 --> 25:41.182
l will call her
from the road.

25:41.227 --> 25:43.127
l thought you were
supposed to work tonight.

25:43.162 --> 25:44.652
Mom, did you hear anything

25:44.697 --> 25:45.789
-l just said?
-Answer me.

25:45.831 --> 25:47.355
Are you booked
to do a show tonight?

25:47.399 --> 25:49.833
Yes.

25:51.070 --> 25:53.971
Well, then if you have
any pride in your work,

25:54.006 --> 25:57.032
and any decency
in you heart,

25:57.076 --> 25:59.340
you will show up
at that club tonight

25:59.378 --> 26:00.902
and you will honor
your commitment.

26:02.681 --> 26:05.343
And then afterwards, you'll
go out back with Donna,

26:05.384 --> 26:07.682
and you'll take her in your arms

26:07.720 --> 26:09.745
and you will give
her a kiss she'll remember

26:09.788 --> 26:11.551
for the rest of her life.

26:35.581 --> 26:38.175
l'd like the, uh,
presidential suite, please.

26:39.251 --> 26:40.809
Stones, man!

26:40.853 --> 26:42.821
Hey, where the hell
have you been?

26:42.855 --> 26:44.379
You don't call,

26:44.423 --> 26:46.084
you don't write,
you never fax me...

26:46.125 --> 26:48.685
Hey, l'm here, man.

26:48.727 --> 26:50.024
Come on.

26:50.062 --> 26:51.723
l'll get you a cup
of bad coffee.

26:52.998 --> 26:54.727
Speaking of bad coffee,
it kind of goes with the decor.

26:54.767 --> 26:55.995
How'd you get stuck

26:56.035 --> 26:57.229
-in this dump?
-Hey, my family

26:57.269 --> 26:59.134
-owns this dump.
-Oh.

26:59.171 --> 27:01.366
Being here keeps me
out of trouble.

27:01.407 --> 27:03.875
Gives me a lot of time to write.

27:03.909 --> 27:06.377
Speaking of trouble, um...

27:06.412 --> 27:07.709
l almost got in some today.

27:07.746 --> 27:09.475
Oh...

27:09.548 --> 27:11.175
Well, that explains
why l'm seeing your mug

27:11.217 --> 27:12.309
for the very first time

27:12.351 --> 27:13.682
since we got out of rehab.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.016
How about you?

27:15.054 --> 27:16.681
Are you staying clean?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.088
l have no choice.

27:20.526 --> 27:22.460
lf it hadn't been
for a big wind today

27:22.494 --> 27:25.588
l probably would've, uh,
got one lit up, you know?

27:25.631 --> 27:27.997
You can't fool
Mother Nature, huh?

27:28.033 --> 27:29.057
So what got to you?

27:29.101 --> 27:30.398
Take a guess.

27:30.436 --> 27:33.496
Ah... a woman.

27:33.606 --> 27:35.164
Yeah.

27:35.207 --> 27:36.868
Kelly? Valerie?

27:36.909 --> 27:39.002
They ganged up on me.

27:39.044 --> 27:41.342
Val supplied the
smoke, but Kelly,

27:41.380 --> 27:42.847
she supplied the motivation.

27:42.881 --> 27:44.246
Let her go, man.

27:44.283 --> 27:47.252
You got to let her go.

27:47.286 --> 27:49.846
-l am trying, but...
-No, no, no-- no, buts.

27:49.888 --> 27:51.947
''But'' is just an excuse
to get high, man.

27:51.991 --> 27:54.186
l figured it out,

27:54.226 --> 27:55.784
all by myself.

27:55.828 --> 27:57.056
Good!

27:57.096 --> 27:59.189
Good.

27:59.231 --> 28:01.199
So what the hell are
you bothering me for?

28:01.233 --> 28:03.997
Oh, l just came for the
incredibly bad coffee.

28:05.437 --> 28:07.302
Stones, man...

28:07.339 --> 28:09.364
you ever give some thought
to the concept that maybe

28:09.408 --> 28:10.898
you ought to figure out
what to do with your life?

28:10.943 --> 28:13.605
Yeah, l considered it.

28:13.646 --> 28:15.637
And?

28:17.049 --> 28:18.710
l don't know.

28:20.352 --> 28:22.047
Well, you better
come up with something.

28:22.087 --> 28:23.850
Because one of these days
the wind is not

28:23.889 --> 28:26.119
going to be blowing when you go
to fire up that joint.

28:32.865 --> 28:36.062
Tell me something, if your
mother's condo got robbed,

28:36.101 --> 28:38.160
would she call the mayor
of Beverly Hills?

28:38.203 --> 28:39.761
Well, technically,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.295
she's on the Los
Angeles border, so...

28:41.340 --> 28:42.898
Oh, no, no, no--
that's not what l mean.

28:42.941 --> 28:44.203
What l mean is,
why is everybody

28:44.243 --> 28:45.767
coming to me with this?

28:45.811 --> 28:48.405
What do l have to do
with campus security?

28:48.447 --> 28:50.108
They have to have
somebody to blame.

28:50.149 --> 28:51.446
Tell me about it.
You should've heard them

28:51.483 --> 28:52.677
at the senate meeting.

28:52.718 --> 28:55.346
Like l have anything to do
with the university budget.

28:55.387 --> 28:58.288
Like l have anything
to do with hiring campus cops.

28:58.324 --> 29:00.087
Well, they probably
think that you

29:00.125 --> 29:02.616
-will talk to the chancellor.
-l did.

29:02.661 --> 29:04.856
Kelly, people get
ripped off all the time:

29:04.897 --> 29:07.127
car stereos, bikes.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.963
What am l supposed
to do about it?

29:09.001 --> 29:10.628
l'm the Student Body
president,

29:10.669 --> 29:12.694
l am not Batman.

29:12.738 --> 29:14.638
Yeah, but l bet you
look cute in tights.

29:14.673 --> 29:16.072
Well, thank you for that.

29:16.108 --> 29:18.338
You know, you are getting
far too wound up over this.

29:18.377 --> 29:22.211
l know. lt's at times like
this when l hate this job.

29:22.247 --> 29:23.441
l'll tell you what.

29:23.482 --> 29:25.643
l will go home and draw
you a nice warm bath

29:25.684 --> 29:26.981
and give you a back rub,

29:27.019 --> 29:28.111
and everything
will be okay.

29:28.153 --> 29:29.677
Well, that sounds
very agreeable.

29:31.523 --> 29:33.320
Did you hear that?

29:33.359 --> 29:35.054
What?

29:35.094 --> 29:37.221
l don't know, l swear
l heard something.

29:37.262 --> 29:38.854
That was my stomach.
l'm hungry.

29:38.897 --> 29:41.127
Let's go get something
to eat.

29:41.166 --> 29:44.431
All of a sudden, l'm getting
the creepiest feeling.

29:44.470 --> 29:45.801
Well, all right. Okay.

29:45.838 --> 29:47.465
Come on. Let's get out.

29:47.506 --> 29:48.803
l'm scared.

29:48.841 --> 29:50.502
lsn't everybody?

29:50.542 --> 29:52.339
The thing is that,
we were right there,

29:52.378 --> 29:53.572
we were steps away...

30:05.858 --> 30:09.089
So on a scale of one to
ten, how mad at me is she?

30:09.128 --> 30:10.959
Somewhere between
ten and 1 1 .

30:10.996 --> 30:12.623
See, Clare, why couldn't
you just tell her

30:12.664 --> 30:14.256
that l supported
Ray, too?

30:14.299 --> 30:15.527
l did. She wouldn't
believe me, okay?

30:15.634 --> 30:18.694
Hey, l thought l heard
you guys out here.

30:18.737 --> 30:20.034
Here, man.

30:20.072 --> 30:21.403
l was out of line yesterday,

30:21.440 --> 30:23.340
so l made you a copy
of my Hendrix bootleg.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.536
-Oh, thanks.
-Anytime.

30:25.577 --> 30:27.374
Excuse me.

30:27.413 --> 30:29.040
Hey, where are
you going, Amy?

30:29.081 --> 30:30.412
Home to my parents.

30:30.449 --> 30:31.780
This school isn't safe anymore.

30:31.817 --> 30:33.751
What's the matter, they
steal another two-wheeler?

30:33.786 --> 30:35.014
This isn't about
bicycles, Lenny.

30:35.053 --> 30:37.146
Melody Reynolds
was raped this afternoon.

30:38.524 --> 30:39.855
What?

30:39.892 --> 30:41.018
ln the bushes
behind the South Quad.

30:41.059 --> 30:42.822
ln broad daylight?

30:43.896 --> 30:44.555
That's awful.

30:44.663 --> 30:47.359
-ls she gonna be okay?
-l don't know.

30:47.399 --> 30:49.867
l saw the ambulance on my way
back from chem lab.

30:49.902 --> 30:51.096
l heard she was slashed up

30:51.136 --> 30:54.299
-pretty good.
-Any idea who did it?

30:54.339 --> 30:55.931
No, but the police
are all over campus.

30:55.974 --> 30:57.134
l got to go.

30:58.644 --> 30:59.804
Well, let's look
on the bright side.

30:59.845 --> 31:01.312
At least they won't
be stealing any bicycles

31:01.346 --> 31:02.870
in the next few days.

31:04.583 --> 31:07.017
You know, Lenny,
you're a real charmer.

31:24.236 --> 31:25.203
What do you say,

31:25.237 --> 31:26.397
-get a cup of coffee?
-No can do.

31:26.438 --> 31:27.871
l've got another meeting
in a few minutes.

31:27.906 --> 31:30.704
How many bureaucrats does it
take to catch a rapist?

31:30.742 --> 31:32.039
Don't ask me man.

31:32.077 --> 31:33.544
lf l ever thought
l had an idea

31:33.579 --> 31:35.240
about how this
university's run,

31:35.280 --> 31:37.271
it's been shattered
in the last two hours.

31:37.316 --> 31:38.806
What's that mean?

31:38.851 --> 31:41.046
You know these people,
they make all these noises

31:41.086 --> 31:43.054
about student
involvement all year,

31:43.088 --> 31:45.113
and then as soon as
there's a crisis they say,

31:45.157 --> 31:46.988
''Brandon the administration
will handle this.''

31:47.025 --> 31:48.287
Well, what about
that girl that was raped?

31:48.327 --> 31:49.419
Wasn't she
in the student senate?

31:49.461 --> 31:50.519
Not exactly.

31:50.562 --> 31:51.756
She was on a lot
of committees.

31:51.797 --> 31:53.230
l know her.

31:53.265 --> 31:54.664
ls there any truth
to that rumor

31:54.700 --> 31:56.224
-that they have a suspect?
-l don't know.

31:56.268 --> 31:57.826
They aren't telling me anything.

31:57.870 --> 31:59.735
-God, l'm so glad to see you.
-Hey, Kel.

31:59.771 --> 32:01.261
-Hey, are you okay?
-No, l'm scared.

32:01.306 --> 32:02.603
lsn't everybody?

32:02.641 --> 32:04.734
The thing is, we were
right there, steps away

32:04.776 --> 32:06.141
from where it happened.
lt could have been me.

32:06.178 --> 32:08.738
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
take it easy.

32:08.780 --> 32:10.247
Do me a favor.
Don't walk around

32:10.282 --> 32:11.715
alone anymore until this
whole thing's settled.

32:12.751 --> 32:14.685
When's that going to be?

32:14.720 --> 32:16.551
l wish l knew.

32:33.238 --> 32:35.536
l heard you were here.

32:35.574 --> 32:37.439
So?

32:37.476 --> 32:38.841
Didn't expect you.

32:38.877 --> 32:40.970
Well, l have a contract
with this nightclub.

32:41.013 --> 32:42.708
Tonight's my last date.

32:42.748 --> 32:44.409
l believe in fulfilling
my obligations.

32:44.449 --> 32:46.747
How professional of you.

32:46.785 --> 32:48.548
Of course, if you want to pay me
not to play,

32:48.587 --> 32:49.849
l'd be more than happy to leave.

32:49.888 --> 32:53.915
l don't believe in paying
someone for nothing.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.551
ls Donna here yet?

32:55.594 --> 32:57.255
Why?

32:57.296 --> 32:59.059
Just wanted to say hello.

32:59.097 --> 33:01.292
Look, you stay away from her,
Valerie, you understand that?

33:01.333 --> 33:03.995
ls that a threat, Ray?

33:04.036 --> 33:05.663
'Cause for the life of me,

33:05.704 --> 33:08.070
l can't see what you have
to threaten me with.

33:08.106 --> 33:09.903
That's where you're wrong.

33:09.942 --> 33:11.000
l've got one thing.

33:11.043 --> 33:12.135
And what's that?

33:12.177 --> 33:13.439
The truth.

33:13.478 --> 33:16.242
Oh, please.

33:16.281 --> 33:18.943
You wouldn't dare tell sweet
Donna the truth about us.

33:18.984 --> 33:20.508
Break the illusion that

33:20.586 --> 33:22.952
her country boy isn't
just another snake in the grass.

33:22.988 --> 33:25.616
You're the snake
in the grass, Valerie.

33:40.772 --> 33:42.399
What's this?

33:42.441 --> 33:44.500
lt's your present.

33:44.543 --> 33:47.410
Well, more for me.

33:47.446 --> 33:48.845
Yeah.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.348
So do you have
any plans tonight?

33:51.383 --> 33:53.248
Yeah, l do,
they just don't happen

33:53.285 --> 33:54.775
to include you.

34:12.536 --> 34:13.594
You could pick something

34:13.639 --> 34:15.697
a little more upbeat,
couldn't you?

34:15.741 --> 34:17.766
Well, if l'd known you were
going to be here, l would've.

34:17.809 --> 34:19.777
Pick one.

34:19.811 --> 34:21.745
So are you
going to stick around

34:21.780 --> 34:23.246
for Ray's farewell concert?

34:23.281 --> 34:25.215
l don't think so.

34:26.885 --> 34:29.513
You know, l never got
a chance to tell you how much

34:29.621 --> 34:32.021
it meant to me that you came to
see me on campus the other day.

34:33.391 --> 34:34.859
lt's no big deal.

34:34.893 --> 34:36.451
Well, it was to me.

34:37.963 --> 34:39.931
You're a good friend.

34:46.905 --> 34:49.237
Brandon and l were just talking
about it the other day.

34:49.274 --> 34:51.902
l'd probably still
be evolving with Finley

34:51.943 --> 34:54.241
if you hadn't exposed him
for the fraud that he is.

34:55.647 --> 34:58.047
What do you want me to say?

34:59.084 --> 35:01.814
That you'll always
be my friend.

35:06.858 --> 35:09.418
l'll always be your friend.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.839
l came up with something.

35:22.874 --> 35:25.434
Who's babysitting
for you tonight?

35:25.477 --> 35:26.501
Jesse's mom, why?

35:26.578 --> 35:28.102
Think she can stay
a little late?

35:29.748 --> 35:31.010
What is that?

35:31.049 --> 35:32.243
Keys to a motel room.

35:32.284 --> 35:33.410
Our motel room.

35:33.452 --> 35:34.851
l booked it by the week.

35:34.886 --> 35:36.080
Peter, l don't know.

35:36.121 --> 35:38.351
That sounds just a
little bit sleazy to me.

35:38.390 --> 35:40.722
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

35:43.261 --> 35:45.229
Tonight?

35:45.263 --> 35:46.355
No, not tonight.

35:46.398 --> 35:48.423
Jesse's mom would
never understand.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.059
Then tomorrow night.

35:50.102 --> 35:51.626
-And the day after that.
-Maybe.

35:51.670 --> 35:53.001
-And the day after...
-Maybe!

35:59.544 --> 36:01.774
You know, l'm not sure
it was such a smart move

36:01.813 --> 36:03.747
not going
to the club tonight?

36:03.782 --> 36:06.216
l told Valerie we were checking
out an act across town.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.809
Oh, great, l told her
we were studying.

36:07.853 --> 36:09.650
You know, maybe
we shouldn't be booking bands

36:09.688 --> 36:10.814
at all for her.

36:10.856 --> 36:12.050
Look, don't worry about it,
all right?

36:12.090 --> 36:13.148
Donna will be over everything

36:13.191 --> 36:14.624
as soon as Ray
books another gig.

36:14.659 --> 36:17.651
-You'll see.
-l don't know, l hope so.

36:17.696 --> 36:19.459
Oh, there's Lenny.

36:19.498 --> 36:20.863
Do you have to invite
him over here.

36:20.899 --> 36:22.491
Yes. Lenny.

36:22.567 --> 36:23.693
Over here.

36:23.735 --> 36:24.827
No, that's okay.

36:24.870 --> 36:25.894
You two don't need company.

36:25.937 --> 36:27.097
Have a nice evening.

36:30.709 --> 36:32.142
No, come on over.

36:32.177 --> 36:33.201
Sit down.

36:35.247 --> 36:36.874
Hey, how you doing, Lenny?

36:36.915 --> 36:38.143
l'm getting by.

36:38.183 --> 36:39.411
-Thanks.
-How's it going?

36:39.451 --> 36:40.645
Good.

36:40.685 --> 36:42.619
So you know a lot
of people on campus, huh?

36:42.654 --> 36:44.781
Well, what can l say?
l'm Mr. Popularity.

36:47.192 --> 36:48.989
What did you think
of my Hendrix tape?

36:49.027 --> 36:50.221
Oh, it was cool.

36:50.262 --> 36:52.492
That, uh, that
one track, the, uh,

36:52.531 --> 36:54.761
the ''Manic Depression''

36:54.800 --> 36:56.700
-where he's on the...
-Excuse me.

36:56.735 --> 36:57.963
Leonard Ziminski?

36:58.003 --> 36:59.163
Yes?

36:59.204 --> 37:01.695
Detective Hank Garcia, LAPD.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.105
Would you come with us, please?

37:04.276 --> 37:06.642
What, am l under arrest
or something?

37:06.678 --> 37:08.168
No, sir, we just have
a few questions.

37:08.213 --> 37:10.238
-About what?
-We don't want to make

37:10.282 --> 37:11.806
this any more difficult
than it has to be.

37:14.853 --> 37:17.686
l didn't steal
any of those bicycles.

37:17.722 --> 37:19.451
This isn't about
bicycles, Mr. Ziminski.

37:19.491 --> 37:21.288
Then what is this about?

37:21.326 --> 37:22.850
David, it's okay.

37:29.534 --> 37:31.365
Let's go.

37:34.973 --> 37:35.940
l don't get this.

37:35.974 --> 37:37.236
What's going on here?

37:37.275 --> 37:39.209
They don't think
he's the rapist, do they?

37:51.823 --> 37:53.814
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

37:55.126 --> 37:56.650
So how about breakfast?
l'm starved.

37:56.695 --> 37:59.289
l'm not really
in the mood to eat.

37:59.331 --> 38:01.265
Look, don't let it
get to you.

38:01.299 --> 38:03.392
You're gonna find another
gig a whole lot sooner

38:03.435 --> 38:06.302
than she'll find another
band as good as yours.

38:06.338 --> 38:09.307
l already found
another gig, Donna.

38:09.341 --> 38:10.899
Really?

38:10.942 --> 38:12.807
That's great! Where?

38:12.844 --> 38:15.312
l got to leave town
for a little while.

38:15.347 --> 38:16.837
What?

38:16.882 --> 38:18.213
l've got this agent

38:18.250 --> 38:20.150
who's booked a bunch
of clubs for me up north.

38:20.185 --> 38:22.517
Mostly college towns.

38:24.522 --> 38:25.853
So why didn't you tell me?

38:25.891 --> 38:28.985
Well, l wasn't sure until today.

38:29.027 --> 38:30.460
And l didn't want to upset you.

38:31.863 --> 38:33.728
When are you leaving?

38:33.765 --> 38:35.357
Tonight.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.495
Oh.

38:39.571 --> 38:42.233
Look, will you tell me
that you're gonna miss me?

38:42.274 --> 38:43.434
'Cause l'm really
gonna miss you.

38:46.044 --> 38:48.035
You know l will.

38:49.381 --> 38:50.780
So when are you coming back?

38:50.815 --> 38:52.680
l don't know.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.187
What's the matter?

38:57.222 --> 39:00.658
This... just isn't like you.

39:02.994 --> 39:04.621
There's something
l've got to tell you, Donna.

39:04.663 --> 39:06.187
Something important.

39:06.231 --> 39:07.562
What?

39:11.503 --> 39:12.993
l love you.

39:14.506 --> 39:16.474
l know that.

39:16.508 --> 39:19.272
-And there's something else.
-No.

39:19.311 --> 39:23.407
Nothing else matters.

39:23.448 --> 39:26.417
You love me,
and that's all l need to know.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.748
Do you mean that?

39:29.788 --> 39:31.756
With all my heart.
