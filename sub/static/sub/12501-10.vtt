let's all raise a glass
to celebrate the retirement

00:06.845 --> 00:08.879
of everyone's favorite park ranger,

00:08.881 --> 00:12.649
the glue that held us all
together for so many years, to...

00:12.651 --> 00:15.352
- Harold.
- Who the [bleep] is Harold?

00:15.354 --> 00:17.254
- I've never heard of him.
- Woody put him on

00:17.255 --> 00:19.155
lookout duty in the
fire tower 20 years ago

00:19.157 --> 00:20.857
and forgot to relieve him.

00:20.859 --> 00:23.727
So he spent two decades
by himself in a small tower?

00:23.729 --> 00:26.162
Wow, he's lucky he didn't go nuts.

00:26.164 --> 00:28.832
You're the devil.
I will burn you!

- Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

00:40.846 --> 00:42.612
Do you really think the bartender

00:42.614 --> 00:45.548
just gave you a free drink
because he's a sweetheart?

00:45.550 --> 00:48.785
- Yeah, why else?
- Because your pants are so tight,

00:48.787 --> 00:52.455
- I can read the mileage on your vagina.
- That is so sexist.

00:52.457 --> 00:55.225
I don't get preferential
treatment because of my looks.

00:55.227 --> 00:57.694
He gives out drinks
because he's a nice guy.

now that our darling Harold

something on your own.

09:51.571 --> 09:54.672
- I guess they found her easy button.
- I guess they found her...

09:54.674 --> 09:56.307
Oh, I could have taken the week off.

09:59.011 --> 09:59.977
Ha!

09:59.979 --> 10:01.012
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:01.014 --> 10:03.081
Hee-ya!

10:03.083 --> 10:06.584
- I did it on my own this time.
- Yes, you did.

10:06.586 --> 10:10.388
But I miss giving your mother
fist training in her lady parts.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.390
Hi-ya!
Hi-ya!

10:12.392 --> 10:14.225
Ho-ya!

10:15.994 --> 10:19.163
Oh, cute, cute, cute!

10:19.165 --> 10:21.699
Be careful.
I rescued that poor little guy

10:21.701 --> 10:23.267
after his parents were
killed by predators.

10:23.269 --> 10:25.570
Oh, no, the Predator?

10:25.572 --> 10:28.272
Someone call 
Arnold Schwarze-[bleep]!

10:28.274 --> 10:30.508
That's not how you
pronounce it, at all.

10:30.510 --> 10:32.343
Hey, little birdie.

10:32.345 --> 10:35.379
You don't need to be so sad.
Here.

10:35.381 --> 10:36.714
What did you just do?

10:36.716 --> 10:39.283
I gave it a zoloft to make him happy.

10:39.285 --> 10:41.285
You can't give a bird zoloft!

10:41.287 --> 10:43.221
[groans sleepily]

10:43.223 --> 10:47.225
Oh, no. [giggles]
That adderall will take the edge off.

10:47.227 --> 10:51.665
See?
Fly away, god's creature.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.398
[Chirps]
[Thud]

10:54.400 --> 10:56.067
What a dream job,

10:56.069 --> 10:57.702
getting paid for sitting
on my ass and chilling.

10:57.704 --> 10:59.971
Them fools think I'm gonna
go crazy in five minutes

10:59.973 --> 11:01.539
just because I'm up here by myself.

11:01.541 --> 11:03.274
I've already been up here four minutes,

11:03.276 --> 11:05.042
and I ain't never felt
more sane in my life.

11:05.044 --> 11:06.911
Ain't that right, owl
made out of spaghetti?

11:06.913 --> 11:08.312
<i>[italian accent] 
Don't-a worry, Denzel.</i>

11:08.314 --> 11:12.413
<i>I think-a you're
gonna be just-a fine.</i>

11:12.552 --> 11:16.420
Thank you all for being here tonight
to celebrate the opening

11:16.422 --> 11:20.124
of the Ethel Anderson
Orphan animal sanctuary.

11:21.426 --> 11:22.426
[feedback]
Hello?

11:22.428 --> 11:26.430
So... do asian people
see the world in letterbox?

11:26.432 --> 11:29.000
Sure, sure, whatever you say.

11:30.335 --> 11:33.137
"Welcome, Amber"?
We're supposed to be celebrating

11:33.139 --> 11:35.106
the grand opening of
my animal sanctuary.

11:35.108 --> 11:36.741
Change of plans, fugly.

11:36.743 --> 11:38.309
Now scram; you're
blocking my view of Amber.

11:38.311 --> 11:40.111
This is my night!

11:40.113 --> 11:41.412
This is not about
some racist pill-popper

11:41.414 --> 11:44.482
- with nice tits.
- Aw, thanks, Ethel.

11:44.484 --> 11:46.984
And thanks for coming
to my welcome party.

11:46.986 --> 11:50.454
- You look so cute.
- Amber, you are so sweet

11:50.456 --> 11:53.491
for lying to Ethel like that.
Give me a hug.

11:53.493 --> 11:55.259
Now one from behind.

11:55.261 --> 11:56.950
Enough of this bullshit, Woody.

11:57.018 --> 11:59.964
We both know that she's not fit
to do any job at Brickleberry.

11:59.966 --> 12:03.134
Sure she is.
What job would you like, Amber?

12:03.136 --> 12:05.962
- I like the baby "aminals."
- Good idea.

12:06.065 --> 12:09.373
From now on, this is the 
Amber Orphan "aminal" sanctuary,

12:09.375 --> 12:13.044
- and you're in charge.
- Woody, you can't do that.

12:13.046 --> 12:15.146
Already done. 
Now cut out, Nanny McPhee.

12:15.148 --> 12:17.215
You're bringing down the party.

12:17.217 --> 12:18.683
[sighs]
Can I get something strong?

12:18.685 --> 12:20.084
Beat it, sea world.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.690
Oh, Connie, are you putting up
more cameras in my cabin?

12:25.692 --> 12:29.026
No, I'm taking them down.
I'm putting them up in Amber's cabin.

12:29.028 --> 12:32.063
Sorry, Ethel.
It's not you; it's me.

12:32.065 --> 12:35.499
- I like hot chicks.
- Hello, low point.

12:35.501 --> 12:37.335
What am I gonna do, Malloy?

12:37.337 --> 12:39.370
Because she's so hot,
I've lost all my animals.

12:39.372 --> 12:40.947
Including Connie.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.140
She'll kill them all
 if I don't do something drastic.

12:43.142 --> 12:44.175
Like what?

12:44.177 --> 12:48.045
If it's looks they want,
it's looks they'll get.

12:49.581 --> 12:52.416
Hmm, plastic surgery.
But why, Ethel?

12:52.418 --> 12:55.086
You're so... 
slightly above average.

12:55.088 --> 12:56.320
I need to be a ten.

12:56.322 --> 12:58.956
Give me the "I hate myself" special.

13:01.026 --> 13:03.995
[smooth, funky music]

13:05.198 --> 13:08.599
- Hello, boys.
- Holy crap.

13:08.601 --> 13:10.935
Did you get stung by a jellyfish?

13:10.937 --> 13:14.438
Oops, I guess I'll have
to pick up these pencils.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.340
- No, no!
- No.

13:16.342 --> 13:20.378
How's about you put me back
in charge of my orphan animals?

13:20.380 --> 13:21.946
How about I put you in charge

13:21.948 --> 13:23.748
of getting your walleyed
nipples away from me?

13:23.750 --> 13:26.584
What?
I'm hot; I'm a ten!

13:26.586 --> 13:28.552
I guess that makes Connie a 13.

13:28.554 --> 13:31.589
Look, Scare-a Reid.
As long as Amber's around,

13:31.591 --> 13:33.891
she's in charge of the "aminals"!

13:33.893 --> 13:37.094
Aw, look how happy
he is since I took over.

13:37.096 --> 13:41.632
I got to buy some more pills.
The red kitty dogs love them.

13:41.634 --> 13:44.135
Fly away, god's creature.

13:44.137 --> 13:48.072
Yay!
Now there's two kitty dogs.

13:48.074 --> 13:49.040
[screams]

13:49.042 --> 13:50.574
[popping, deflating]

13:50.576 --> 13:54.111
So far, this has been pretty easy.
Gotta say, Malloy,

13:54.113 --> 13:56.547
I think my mom put out
for absolutely no reason.

13:56.549 --> 13:58.416
I could have done all of this myself.

13:58.418 --> 14:01.452
Williams!
You're a dead man, you [bleep] dick!

14:01.454 --> 14:04.455
Jimmy Wisniewski,
the bully from my childhood?

14:04.457 --> 14:07.091
You haven't picked on
me since the 7th grade.

14:07.093 --> 14:09.060
That's right, Williams,
and the only reason

14:09.062 --> 14:10.394
I stopped picking on you is because...

14:10.396 --> 14:13.164
My mom?
But we were 12!

14:13.166 --> 14:16.334
She said I screw like a
13-year-old, [bleep] dick!

14:16.336 --> 14:20.304
Wait, she's been sleeping
with you for the last 20 years?

14:20.306 --> 14:23.941
Every Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.,
but she just cut me off,

14:23.943 --> 14:25.343
which means you got a beat-down coming.

14:25.345 --> 14:28.145
Meet me at the flagpole
at sundown, dingus!

14:28.147 --> 14:30.348
Are you sure we can't
work something else out?

14:30.350 --> 14:34.919
You know, I have my
mom's tiny, soft hands.

14:34.921 --> 14:36.153
Good, they'll be easier to break,

14:36.155 --> 14:37.788
you [bleep] dick!
[screams]

14:37.690 --> 14:39.757
<i>Damn, I'm loving it here,</i>

14:39.759 --> 14:42.159
and I've never felt less
crazy than I do right now,

14:42.161 --> 14:43.661
chillin' with my new friends,

14:43.663 --> 14:47.431
<i>spaghetti owl, turtle-ini,
and beaver-oni.</i>

14:47.433 --> 14:49.934
I'm so happy to have all you
talking italian-food animals

14:49.936 --> 14:51.302
to keep me from going nuts up here.

14:51.304 --> 14:54.505
- Hey, want to blaze-a one?
- Hell, yeah!

14:54.507 --> 14:58.383
Spark that shit up,
fettuccini al-frogo.

14:58.644 --> 15:00.311
Hi, I'm looking to hire a hit man

15:00.313 --> 15:02.613
to kill a female park
ranger named Amber.

15:02.615 --> 15:05.149
<i>Why would I want to kill Amber?
She's hot as balls.</i>

15:05.151 --> 15:06.650
Woody? Is that you?

15:06.652 --> 15:09.320
Do you have a side
business as a hit man?

15:09.322 --> 15:10.688
<i>Hit man? No.</i>

15:10.690 --> 15:14.649
This isn't Woody Johnson.
It's Judy Wonson.

15:14.684 --> 15:15.292
I'm... [high-pitched] a woman.

15:15.294 --> 15:19.463
Oh, I better go make a tuna casserole
and douche the ol' clam.

15:19.465 --> 15:20.972
I'm a woman.

15:24.419 --> 15:26.520
Oh, screw it. I'll do it myself.

15:27.922 --> 15:28.922
[gasps]

15:28.924 --> 15:32.249
Oh! Now I get it.

15:32.284 --> 15:33.360
[rustling]

15:34.395 --> 15:37.598
- Ethel, what are you doing here?
- Something I've

15:37.599 --> 15:40.801
wanted to do from
the minute you got here.

15:40.803 --> 15:43.870
God damn, you are hot.

15:43.872 --> 15:47.441
[Both moaning]
[Music]

15:47.443 --> 15:49.743
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

15:49.745 --> 15:51.878
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

15:51.880 --> 15:53.727
<i>Oh, my god.
[both moaning]</i>

15:53.832 --> 15:56.516
Uhhh... Oh!

[gasps]

16:00.477 --> 16:02.077
Jesus Christ.

16:02.079 --> 16:05.814
I can't believe I fell for her too.
But that ass is so...

16:05.816 --> 16:08.416
No, no, no.

16:08.418 --> 16:09.818
[crying]

16:09.820 --> 16:11.686
Amber, are you crying?

16:11.688 --> 16:13.622
I thought you were the only one here

16:13.624 --> 16:16.525
that didn't look at me
like a piece of meat.

16:16.527 --> 16:19.127
I'm sick of getting by on my looks.

16:19.129 --> 16:22.430
And because I never had
to work for anything,

16:22.432 --> 16:26.825
- I suck at everything!
- You could be a great ranger,

16:26.977 --> 16:30.175
- and I can help you!
- Really?

16:30.424 --> 16:32.457
It's not about looks.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.260
I know for a fact that you
have greatness inside of you.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.630
- You think so?
- Smell for yourself.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.734
I don't know, Malloy.
Are you sure your plan will work?

16:42.736 --> 16:46.271
Trust me.
It's the key to street fighting.

16:46.273 --> 16:50.709
Don't worry, Wisniewski.
I'll try not to kill you.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.277
Ha-doo-ken!

16:53.479 --> 16:55.714
Ha-doo-ken!
Ha-doo-ken!

16:55.716 --> 16:57.082
Something's wrong, Malloy.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.285
- The fireballs aren't coming out.
- Keep trying.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.421
Ha-doo-ken!
Ha-doo-ken!

17:02.423 --> 17:05.589
Uh, sonic boom!
Sonic boom!

17:05.592 --> 17:08.126
Uh, yoga-flame.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.563
[groaning]

17:11.565 --> 17:13.498
Somebody help me!

17:13.500 --> 17:15.099
No, no.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.337
It's time to take control
of my life!

17:18.339 --> 17:20.339

I forgot to pack any food.

Well, Denzel, you know what they say.

Ah!
My eye! I'm blind!

17:57.932 --> 18:01.200
What have you done?
You crazy bastard!

18:01.202 --> 18:04.269
What? You were singing
a song called "eat us."

18:04.271 --> 18:05.771
It was just a song.

18:05.773 --> 18:08.507
We thought you were our friend,
not a sick cannibal.

18:08.509 --> 18:11.543
But I was hungry,
and y'all are made out of pasta!

- My eye! [wailing]

Let's teach him a lesson.
We'll eat him.

Get back, all of you! I'll torch every

18:20.437 --> 18:22.354

- Whoa!

<i>Oh, shiiiii... </i>

18:29.196 --> 18:31.196
Could you tell me
when he hits the ground?

I no longer have depth perception.

- A-roo!
- That's right.

You're on your way to
being a great ranger.

18:42.209 --> 18:44.810
- Yay!
- I think we're ready

18:44.812 --> 18:46.545
for the "plant or animal" coloring book.

18:46.547 --> 18:49.214
Be right back.
Oh, in the meantime,

18:49.216 --> 18:53.185
study these forest flash cards.

18:53.187 --> 18:56.054
Oh, my god.
That's a...

18:59.659 --> 19:03.061
Fiery!
And it's right where the sanctuary is!

19:03.063 --> 19:07.941
This is it, Amber.
It's time to be a great ranger.

19:08.168 --> 19:09.735
Amber, where'd you go?

19:09.737 --> 19:12.204
I was thinking we could
do arts and crafts next.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.172
We can work on our scissoring.

19:14.174 --> 19:16.808
Did someone say, "scissoring?"

19:18.396 --> 19:19.630
[camera clicks]

19:19.632 --> 19:23.133
You know, Malloy, it feels good
to finally take control of my life.

19:23.135 --> 19:24.401
What are you talking about?

19:24.403 --> 19:26.870
Your mom's been banging
Wisniewski for a half an hour.

19:26.872 --> 19:28.972
Suck that, you [bleep] dick.

19:28.974 --> 19:32.376
Yeah, but I called her.
It was my decision.

19:32.378 --> 19:34.077
That's taking control.

19:34.079 --> 19:35.812
Next week, regular time?

19:38.783 --> 19:40.951
Mom, I now realize that you were only

19:40.952 --> 19:43.120
banging everyone because you love me.

19:43.122 --> 19:45.422
Thanks for [bleep]-ing my life up...

Top of the world, Steve.

19:50.763 --> 19:53.130
You're a fat park ranger,
and your mom's a dirty whore.

19:54.966 --> 19:57.734
Amber? Amber!
Has anyone seen Amber?

19:57.736 --> 20:00.971
Ethel, I... 
I think we lost her.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.839
<i>[laughs] I did it!</i>

20:02.841 --> 20:06.510
- I saved them!
- Whoa.

20:06.512 --> 20:10.847
Did I get burned a little?
I can't really feel anything.

20:10.849 --> 20:14.818
It's not... bad.
Here.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.119
Ooh, much better.

20:16.121 --> 20:19.856
You were right, Ethel.
I can be a great ranger.

20:19.858 --> 20:24.861
So, um... thank you for
your bravery, and, um...

20:24.863 --> 20:25.929
Amber, you're fired.

20:25.931 --> 20:29.132
Oh! Because I have 
a couple of burns?

20:29.134 --> 20:31.301
No, because I can
see through your face.

20:31.303 --> 20:35.505
Ethel, tell them what you told me,
that it's not about looks.

20:35.507 --> 20:37.974
It's about what's on the inside.

20:37.976 --> 20:39.810
You know what, Woody?
Amber's right.

20:39.812 --> 20:43.013
Looks or no looks, she
does belong at Brickleberry.

20:43.015 --> 20:45.015
And I know the perfect place for her.

20:45.017 --> 20:49.519
