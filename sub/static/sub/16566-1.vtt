PAUL: (PRESENT DAY) I remember so vividly
showing up at a show,

01:38.265 --> 01:40.438
and you'd be in your ordinary clothes,

01:40.559 --> 01:42.778
and then you'd take out
of your little suitcase

01:42.894 --> 01:45.818
your suit, and your shirt,

01:45.939 --> 01:48.112
and put 'em on,

01:48.233 --> 01:51.032
and then finally your Beatle boots.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.031
And you'd stand up.

01:54.156 --> 01:58.787
And you just looked at each other like,
"Yeah, there we are."

01:59.411 --> 02:00.412
One, two.

02:01.079 --> 02:06.882

02:18.639 --> 02:21.609
# It's you she's thinking of

02:21.725 --> 02:24.103
# And she told me what to say

02:24.227 --> 02:26.446
# She says she loves you

02:26.563 --> 02:28.986
# And you know that can't be bad

02:30.901 --> 02:32.403
# She loves you

02:32.527 --> 02:35.451
# And you know you should be glad

02:37.240 --> 02:40.244
# She said you hurt her so

02:40.369 --> 02:43.248
# She almost lost her mind

02:43.372 --> 02:46.421
# Now she says she knows

02:46.541 --> 02:49.260
# You're not the hurting kind

02:49.378 --> 02:50.880
# Because she loves you

02:51.004 --> 02:53.177
# And you know that can't be bad

02:55.550 --> 02:57.018

'Such confusion here at London airport.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.789
'Hundreds and hundreds

03:25.038 --> 03:26.335
- They're what?
- They're gorgeous.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.130
It's their haircuts, and the clothes,
they're settin' a new fashion.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.755
The way they sing, their clothes, their hair.
They sound different.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.597
But they're confident, they're natural.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.592
They sort of represent the teenage people.

PAUL: By the end,
it became quite complicated.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.456
But at the beginning,
things were really simple.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.334
Thank you very much everybody!

04:07.247 --> 04:10.171
- Thank you, yeah.
- Thank you very much.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.598
PAUL: A lot of people thought
we were an overnight sensation.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.058
We weren't.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.394
People didn't realise
we'd had all this development.

04:21.511 --> 04:26.438
They just saw these four things
that looked alike with this haircut,

04:26.558 --> 04:28.185
and they knew how to play,

04:28.310 --> 04:29.937
and they were a bit of a laugh,

04:30.061 --> 04:33.941
you know, 'cause that's what we'd
been doing all those years previously.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.530
JOHN: I had a group.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.998
I was the singer and the leader.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.876
I met Paul and said,
"Do you want to join me band", you know?

04:45.327 --> 04:47.750
And then George joined.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.211
We were great live performers then.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.881
I don't think anybody in the world
ever saw us outside of Liverpool

04:53.001 --> 04:54.719
and a few places where we travelled to,

04:54.836 --> 04:58.215
because that's when we had to perform
live to a small audience in a dance hall,

04:58.340 --> 04:59.466
we had to hold them.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.349
PAUL: We were just playing, all the time.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.143
Then we went out to Hamburg,

05:05.263 --> 05:07.561
and that was a real slog.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.355
We were playing,
sometimes eight hours a day.

05:13.939 --> 05:17.910
GEORGE: I was right in the middle
of the naughtiest city in the world,

05:18.026 --> 05:19.494
at 17 years old.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.909
It was kind of exciting.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.159
(WHISTLING)

05:27.661 --> 05:28.913
RINGO: I was with Rory Storm.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.914
We were like the top band in Liverpool,

05:31.039 --> 05:34.464
and for some reason, this guy in Hamburg
decided to come to Liverpool

05:34.584 --> 05:37.758
and take all the bands to Germany to play.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.258
We went to see these punks,
and that was it.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.726
PAUL: I still remember that moment,
the first time Ringo played with us.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.066
Bang, he kicks in and it's like...

05:49.182 --> 05:50.684
And it was an oh, my God moment,

05:50.809 --> 05:53.733
we're like... I remember looking,
and we're all looking at each other, like,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.982
"Yeah, this is it."

05:57.315 --> 05:58.942
I'm getting very emotional.

06:03.572 --> 06:07.122
GEORGE: Once we got Ringo,
we started to do better

06:07.242 --> 06:10.041
and sort of do it professionally.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.834
RINGO: You know, for me,
I'm an only child,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.549
I felt like I suddenly had three brothers.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.051
We just wanted to play.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.345
Playing was the most important thing.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.387
GEORGE: Hamburg was a bit messy, you know,

06:27.512 --> 06:30.106
I mean, to sleep
all huddled together in one room.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.850
You know, no bathroom or anything,

06:31.975 --> 06:35.104
but then we'd had practice, because
we didn't have a bathroom at home.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.692
JOHN: We used to have this saying that
I used to chant and they would answer,

06:39.816 --> 06:41.284
when they were depressed, you know,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.119
and thinking the group was going nowhere,

06:43.236 --> 06:46.490
and this is a shitty deal,
and we're in a shitty dressing room.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.743
I say, "Where are we going, fellows?"
And they'd go:

06:48.867 --> 06:50.835
GEORGE: To the top, Johnny.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.795
JOHN: And I'd say, where's that, fellows?
And they'd say:

06:52.913 --> 06:55.382
GEORGE: To the toppermost
of the poppermost, Johnny.

06:55.498 --> 06:59.219
JOHN: And I'd say, "Right!"
And we'd all sort of cheer up.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.349
GEORGE: We were always kinda,
you know, a little nervous

07:04.466 --> 07:07.219
before each step we went up the ladder.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.273
But we didn't realise what was to come.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.627

RICHARD CURTIS: I was living in Sweden,
and The Beatles came to Sweden.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.601
I remember I went day after day

07:56.726 --> 07:59.195
and stood outside the hotel
at the end of school.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.827
And I just remember
seeing their figures on the balcony.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.537
Once a day, The Beatles
would come out and wave.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.124
Hello, my name's Paul McCartney
and I play bass guitar.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.743
Hello, people there,

08:12.867 --> 08:16.167
I'm George Harrison
and I play solo guitar, yeah.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.631
This is Ringo Starr and I play drums.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.796
And this is John Lennon,
and I play better guitar.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.255
CURTIS: They were like a gang,
do you know what I mean?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.302
They each had their little characteristic.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.801
I mean, John was surprisingly fearless.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.053
Paul was surprisingly cute.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.770
Ringo was cheeky and irresistible.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.437
And George was the one
that my sister was in love with.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.607
Now, you're tremendously lively
and full of zing on the stage,

08:39.727 --> 08:42.527
how difficult is it for you
to keep up this zest?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.445
Well, we do the zest we can.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.782
CURTIS: I've spent my whole career,
in a way,

08:48.903 --> 08:52.282
trying to recapture in things that I write,

08:52.407 --> 08:55.661
the hilarity of four friends,

08:55.785 --> 08:58.584
one drink down, age 19,

08:58.705 --> 09:03.802
laughing at their jokes and all the
new stuff that they find really funny.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.764
The Beatles were kind of the dream
of how you might be with your friends

09:07.881 --> 09:09.133
as you went through life.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.510
All screaming, screaming,
that's the man of the year,

09:11.634 --> 09:13.762
and you say, "Why do they scream?"

09:14.304 --> 09:15.977
- I don't know.
- No.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.940
I couldn't tell you.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.152
If somebody scores a goal,

09:21.269 --> 09:25.274
there's a louder cheer
from all the people,

09:25.398 --> 09:28.823
so if we shake our heads,
it's the equivalent of scoring a goal,

09:28.943 --> 09:32.493
and that's when the screams are loudest.
Do you see what I mean?

09:32.614 --> 09:34.867
Yes, yes I do understand.
You do that and they scream.

"number one in America,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.734
We just jumped on each other's backs,
ran around

13:33.855 --> 13:37.860
and just partied round and round
this little room for hours,

13:37.984 --> 13:39.736
just screaming.

I know this for myself,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.638
and I know because
we talked to each other,

14:02.759 --> 14:05.603
we were in America
before the plane landed.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.563
I could feel New York.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.933

as the mother lode

for British performers,
maybe for any performer in the world.

a bunch of British Elvis Presleys?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.873
It's not true, it's not true.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.296
IZZARD: What that is,
is what any comedian would want to do.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.835
The trick of dealing with heckles

15:14.956 --> 15:17.584
is to say the first thing
that comes into your brain,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.676
and they'd already got to that place.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.637

You hope to get a haircut at all?

- Nope, no thanks.

And that's no lie, it's true.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.732
IZZARD: The Beatles were cheeky.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.898
It's kind of what every kid wants to be,
a lot of adults want to be,

15:36.018 --> 15:39.693
being able to talk back to people
who are telling you what to do.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.784
They were cheeky, and I think
people in the world liked that.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.618
It's not aggressive, it's not nasty.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.737
It's just brazen.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.331
REPORTER: Why does your music
excite them so much?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.825
We don't know really.

If we knew, we'd form another group
and be managers.

Now, yesterday and today our theatre's
been jammed with newspapermen

16:08.092 --> 16:09.844
and hundreds of photographers
from all over the nation,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.892
and these veterans agree with me
that the city

16:12.013 --> 16:15.313
never has witnessed the excitement
stirred by these youngsters from Liverpool

16:15.433 --> 16:16.730
who call themselves The Beatles.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.855
Now tonight, you're gonna twice
be entertained by them.

Right now, and again
in the second half of our show.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.200

# Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

# Remember I'll always be true

16:39.040 --> 16:41.839
# And then while I'm away

16:41.959 --> 16:44.803
# I'll write home every day

16:44.921 --> 16:48.516
# And I'll send all my loving to you... #

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: We watched
Ed Sullivan every Sunday night,

16:53.804 --> 16:54.930
my brother, my mum and I.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.026
It wasn't even a question,
it was just, that's what we'd do.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.612
And man, I had never seen anybody
that looked like them.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.279
# Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

17:05.398 --> 17:08.242
# Tomorrow I'll miss you

17:08.361 --> 17:12.537
# Remember I'll always be true... #

17:14.075 --> 17:15.291
It was like a revelation.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.538
And when you're a little kid, you don't know
it's a revelation, but it was like...

17:18.663 --> 17:20.711
the whole world lit up.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.381
Suddenly I felt like
I could be friends with them.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.096
And I'm black, you know?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.850
# All my loving

17:30.967 --> 17:34.016
# Ooh, all my loving

17:34.136 --> 17:37.140
# I will send to you #

17:45.731 --> 17:47.324
GOLDBERG: People would say to me,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.535
"You think you want to be white?
You like those guys?"

17:49.652 --> 17:53.407
It was like, I never thought of them
really as white guys.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.495
They were The Beatles.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.210
They were colourless, you know?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.796
And they were fucking amazing.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.836
The Beatles gave me this idea

18:05.960 --> 18:07.803
that everybody was welcome.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
If you weren't the hippest kid
in the neighbourhood,

18:12.842 --> 18:15.846
it didn't matter,
because you could be a Beatle fan,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.392
and I liked that.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.642
And that sort of carried me
into these older days

18:20.766 --> 18:23.189
where it's like, I am my own person.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.572
I can look the way I want,
I can be the way I want,

18:26.689 --> 18:29.067
and it's OK.

18:29.191 --> 18:33.321
And I got that specifically from them.

- No press, you fool.

from the incredible pressure.

- No, it's me.

- Cut.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.119
RINGO: But we loved it.

19:14.236 --> 19:18.582
To pick up a small transistor radio -
it was the first time in New York -

19:18.699 --> 19:20.417
and hear you coming out the radio...

19:20.534 --> 19:22.286
Ah! It was mind blowing.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.604
Their manager's name is Mr Brian Epstein.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.778
PAUL: Looking back now,
it was Brian Epstein.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.613
He was the guy who got us famous, really.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.743
Brian was class.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.449
That was what Brian was.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.497
He was like Liverpool class.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.965
Well, Brian was 27.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.505
He was a grown-up. He had a car.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.135
The Beatles' parents were Liverpudlian,

20:15.256 --> 20:18.726
working-class people
that had been through a war.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.729
Our playgrounds were bomb sites.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.192
His parents ran a record shop.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.687
REPORTER: Well, it seems a funny sort of
world for a young man like you to be in.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.986
How did you get into it?
How did you start?

20:33.107 --> 20:34.529
EPSTEIN: I heard about them

20:34.650 --> 20:38.905
through a lad
who was asking for a record by them

20:39.029 --> 20:40.155
in one of my stores,

20:40.281 --> 20:44.502
or my family's stores, in October, 1961.

20:45.453 --> 20:49.424
Growin' up, my mum
always wanted me to talk proper.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.087
You know, all of us, really.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.381
You know, I could talk
like I'm from Liverpool.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.132
Fuck you, I'm tellin' you,
don't give me any hard time.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.936
PAUL: Whereas Brian was very
well-mannered, very well-spoken,

21:02.052 --> 21:04.146
so we felt we could trust him.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.812
EPSTEIN: I went down to see them
in Liverpool at The Cavern Club.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.560
MC: The Beatles sing Some Other Guy.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.779
EPSTEIN:
They were fresh and they were honest.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.750
And they had what I thought
was a sort of presence.

21:23.866 --> 21:27.587
And this is a terrible, vague term,
"star quality."

21:27.703 --> 21:29.546
Whatever that is, they had it.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.884
# Some other guy now

21:34.001 --> 21:37.471
# Has taken my love away from me, oh now

21:37.588 --> 21:39.056
# Some other guy now

21:39.173 --> 21:41.722
# Has taken away my sweet desire... #

21:42.968 --> 21:45.437
PAUL: He was looking
at our stage presence.

21:46.263 --> 21:50.734
In the early days,
it was clear that he had a vision of us

21:50.851 --> 21:54.105
that was beyond the vision
we had of ourselves.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.039
EPSTEIN: At that stage, they were
playing around the clubs in Liverpool,

22:04.156 --> 22:05.999
rather scruffily dressed.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.039
Black leather jackets and jeans,

22:08.160 --> 22:11.039
and a rather untidy stage presentation.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.791
But having great fun.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.840
But I don't think that they would have
bothered to do anything about it,

22:16.961 --> 22:22.058
because young, inexperienced people
are not really very good

22:22.174 --> 22:26.395
at presenting themselves properly
in the right sort of quarters.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.600
PAUL: He took us to a tailor, Beno Dorn,

22:30.724 --> 22:34.524
and we went to this guy,
and he made us up suits, you know.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.033
I'm not sure exactly what time
we'll be back from Washington.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.778
We're going to Washington tomorrow
and then coming back on Wednesday.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.656
Good night.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.746
Brian kept us together as a team.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.883
REPORTER: What place do you think
this story of The Beatles is gonna have

22:56.000 --> 22:57.968
in the history of Western culture?

22:58.627 --> 23:00.550
You must be kidding with that question.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.173
Culture? It's not culture.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.550
- What is it?
- It's a good laugh.

23:07.678 --> 23:08.895
This is Harold James.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.267
And now, from
the Washington D.C. Coliseum,

23:12.391 --> 23:15.361
the world's most exciting group,

23:15.477 --> 23:18.902
Capitol Recording stars, The Beatles.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.577
PAUL: You know, the suits.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.742
It's the simplest of ideas.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.742
It suddenly made us one person.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.452
A four-headed monster.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.963
Hello.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.065
Thank you.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.704
Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody,

24:06.820 --> 24:10.450
and good evening, how do you do?

24:11.492 --> 24:13.995
We would like to sing a song

24:14.119 --> 24:17.714
which we recorded on an LP that we made.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.801
That's English for "album".
An album that we made.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.920
And we'd like you, if you would,

24:23.045 --> 24:25.514
to sort of join in and clap your hands,
you know,

24:25.631 --> 24:27.133
and stamp your feet.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.805
The song's called I Saw Her Standing There.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.352
One, two, three, four.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.647
# Well, she was just seventeen

24:42.439 --> 24:44.362
# You know what I mean

24:45.317 --> 24:49.823
# And the way looked
was way beyond compare

24:51.448 --> 24:55.453
# How could I dance with another

24:55.577 --> 24:59.957
# Whoo... Since I saw her standing there

25:02.543 --> 25:05.262
# Well, she looked at me

25:05.379 --> 25:08.053
# And I, I could see

25:08.173 --> 25:09.925
# That before too long

25:10.050 --> 25:12.644
# I'd fall in love with her

25:14.388 --> 25:18.518
# She wouldn't dance with another

25:18.642 --> 25:23.022
# Whoo... When I saw her standing there

# Well, my heart went boom

25:28.277 --> 25:30.905
# When I crossed that room

25:31.030 --> 25:37.413
# And I held her hand in mine

25:39.872 --> 25:42.967
# Whoa, we danced through the night

25:43.083 --> 25:46.087
# And we held each other tight

25:46.211 --> 25:51.217
# And before too long
I fell in love with her

25:52.468 --> 25:56.018
# Now, I'll never dance with another

25:56.847 --> 26:01.728
# Whoo... Since I saw her standing there

26:01.852 --> 26:03.069
# Whoa

26:26.877 --> 26:29.175

26:29.880 --> 26:32.599

26:55.697 --> 27:00.043
# Well, since I saw her standing there #

27:27.688 --> 27:28.905
Which one are you?

27:29.022 --> 27:30.615
- Eric.
- Eric?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.578
It's not for me, it's for Paul.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.281
I'm doing this...

27:38.448 --> 27:41.577
- Eric, here is the American public.
- I'm John.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.500
- You're John?
- It was only a joke.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.543
Yes, well, John,
here is the American public.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.291
40 million American viewers...

27:47.416 --> 27:49.589
- It only looks like one man to me.
- ...staring you right in the face.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.711
Oh, it's the cameraman.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.713
What is your impression
of the American public?

27:52.838 --> 27:55.182
- You've been here for a while now.
- They're the wildest.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.721
- Why?
- I don't know.

27:56.842 --> 28:00.437
Tonight was, you know,
marvellous, ridiculous.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.602
All those 8,000 people
all shouting at once,

28:02.723 --> 28:04.646
and we were trying to shout louder
than them with microphones,

28:04.766 --> 28:05.938
and we still couldn't beat them.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.403
Was America something like
what you thought it would be like?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.238
No, nothing like it.
We thought it'd be much quieter.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.699
We thought it, you know,
we'd have to grow on everybody.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.239
But everybody seems to know us all,
you know,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.408
as if we've been here for years.
It's great.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.577
I love The Beatles for them
and I'll always love 'em,

28:19.698 --> 28:22.747
even when I'm 105
and an old grandmother, I'll love 'em.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.916
Adrienne from Brooklyn loves you
with all her heart.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.967
PAUL: It was a romantic thing for us,

28:31.084 --> 28:34.338
being in America,
playing to our American fans.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.262
- Ringo has a sexy nose.
- A sexy nose?

28:37.382 --> 28:39.225
George has got sexy eyelashes.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.391
- Who has?
- George. He's got sexy eyelashes.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.854
- Which one is George?
- Sexy eyelashes.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.019
- That one.
- That one, he's beautiful.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.063
He's got sexy eyelashes.

28:47.768 --> 28:52.365
PAUL: The very earliest records
were all pleas to the fans.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.984
And it was all personal article.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.361
JOHN: In the early days,
we didn't count lyrics at all,

28:57.486 --> 29:01.116
you know, as long as it had
some vague theme.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.119
She loves you, and he loves him,
and they love each other.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.416

- # Hold

29:14.836 --> 29:17.510
# You, you, you... #

29:18.924 --> 29:21.018
PAUL: It's all direct.
It was kind of conscious.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.887
We were actually appealing to girls.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.231
We were young boys
who were appealing to girls, you know,

29:26.348 --> 29:27.474
to get our fan base.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.481
# You... #

29:31.812 --> 29:32.859
In those days...

29:36.149 --> 29:37.742
- Go on.
- You yourselves,

29:37.859 --> 29:39.782
you know, you write very good songs.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.997
- Don't you?
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.913
- How do you write songs?
- Well, you know...

29:45.033 --> 29:46.626
We... it just depends.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.747
Sometimes we write them on old pianos
and anything that's lying round, you know.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.968
Normally we sit down
and try and bash one out, sort of thing.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.677
But then again, there's no formula,

29:55.794 --> 29:59.139
because he can come up with one
one day, completely finished,

29:59.256 --> 30:00.803
we still say we both wrote it then.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.514
# I got every reason on earth to be mad

30:08.390 --> 30:12.065
# Cos I just lost the only girl I had... #

30:12.853 --> 30:14.776
JOHN: There's been a single
every three months,

30:14.896 --> 30:18.617
and we'd have to be writing
literally in the hotel or in a van.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.328
PAUL: We wrote on the road.
Mainly me and John.

30:21.445 --> 30:25.370
George developed as a writer later
and became an unbelievable writer.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.117
But at the beginning,
it was mainly me and John.

30:27.743 --> 30:31.418
So we would be in a hotel room
with two twin beds,

30:31.538 --> 30:36.669
and he'd have his acoustic guitar,
I'd have mine, sit opposite each other,

30:36.793 --> 30:38.966
and because I was left-handed,
he was right-handed,

30:39.087 --> 30:40.259
it was like looking in a mirror.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.639
And we'd just start something
and ricochet off each other.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.934
He'd do a line, I'd do a line.
And we'd just write it down.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.183
And when we were finished,
we didn't have a manuscript,

30:50.307 --> 30:52.560
but we had a sheet of paper
with the words,

30:52.684 --> 30:54.231
and we remembered the chords.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.072

PAUL: My relationship with John
was very close, musically,

31:25.967 --> 31:28.595
you know,
we looked after each other, really.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.564
He was like someone you kinda
looked up to a little bit, you know.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.311
When I first met him,
I talked to people in my life,

31:35.435 --> 31:37.733
and they said, "What do you like to do?
What are your hobbies and stuff?"

31:37.854 --> 31:41.529
And I sort of said, "I like songwriting.
I've written a couple of songs."

31:41.650 --> 31:43.573
And they'd all go, "Oh, yeah? Great.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.491
"What did you think about the football?"

31:45.612 --> 31:48.161
And I'd go, "Oh, OK, nobody interested."

31:48.281 --> 31:51.251
When I said that to John,
he said, "Oh, so have I."

31:51.868 --> 31:54.747
I go, "Whoa, wait a minute.
Big connection here."

31:54.871 --> 31:57.465
I'd never met anyone who'd written songs.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.752
So that's how we started.

32:00.544 --> 32:04.344

300 songs John and I wrote together.

ELVIS COSTELLO:
My mother's father was from Liverpool.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.590
There was that pride thing
that they were from Liverpool, you know.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.133
I'm nine years old.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.802
When your favourite group is The Beatles,

32:46.923 --> 32:48.800
you know, it is like supporting
the winning football team,

32:48.925 --> 32:50.973
because it's like
they just keep winning the cup.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.981
You'd wait all week
to hear the hit parade show

32:54.097 --> 32:56.395
so that you would hear,
for sure, The Beatles' songs,

32:56.516 --> 32:57.859
because they would get to number one.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.776

(ANNOUNCERS,

33:59.162 --> 34:00.664
COSTELLO: It was a different kind of fame,

34:00.789 --> 34:04.134
because we didn't have social media,
we didn't have satellite television,

34:04.251 --> 34:07.050
and yet the word would spread
that this group were coming.

it got bigger in the next.

there was more people
came to see us there than anywhere.

I mean, it looked like,
I think the whole of Australia was there.

from Adelaide Airport to the city,

There was a ship, going to discover
the new world, you know?

34:33.446 --> 34:35.699
And The Beatles were in the crow's nest,

34:35.824 --> 34:38.077
and we just said, "Land ho!"

not just Beatles but our movement,
our generation,

35:04.728 --> 35:06.947

35:46.978 --> 35:51.609
"You ought to be able to make a good,

you know.

LESTER: The only thing that was apparent,
through the seven weeks of the shoot,

36:11.461 --> 36:13.634
is that sense of protection.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.600

RICHARD CURTIS: One of the things about
A Hard Day's Night

36:25.892 --> 36:27.565
and everything you heard about The Beatles

36:27.686 --> 36:29.063
is the lack of self-pity,

36:29.187 --> 36:32.487
that we had a feeling they were adoring
what was happening to them,

36:32.607 --> 36:35.861
and therefore that made it like
a completely virtuous circle.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.809
Not your parents.

Beatles hysteria is kind of a muscle flexing
of that generation, the Baby Boom.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.524
# Yeah, roll over Beethoven... #

38:38.316 --> 38:42.913
PAUL: The first time we went to America,
it was just 10 days,

38:43.029 --> 38:45.578
so when we came back,
we knew they were waiting for us.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.874
REPORTER: Tell me, several people
on these radio programmes want to know,

38:53.998 --> 38:56.296
what do you plan to do
when the bubble bursts?

38:56.417 --> 38:58.135
Not sure, Fred.

38:58.628 --> 38:59.800
But we really want to know.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.344
We're gonna have a laugh.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.843
LARRY KANE:
The biggest question in 1964 was,

39:04.968 --> 39:07.562
"When is the bubble gonna burst?"

39:07.679 --> 39:10.899
RADIO: 'WFUN South Miami.'

39:11.724 --> 39:13.067
I was 21 years old,

39:13.184 --> 39:17.906
news director of a station in Miami,
WFUN, Fun in the Sun Radio.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.865
RADIO: 'WFUN.'

39:21.317 --> 39:23.911
We got word that The Beatles
were gonna come to America,

39:24.028 --> 39:26.872
and I wrote a letter
asking for an interview with them,

39:26.990 --> 39:29.789
and I sent it to Brian Epstein,
their manager.

39:29.909 --> 39:33.379
I got this letter back
inviting me on the tour.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.425
And I said, "I'm not going.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.636
"We've got the war in Vietnam escalating,
the president just died,

39:43.756 --> 39:47.010
"Muhammad Ali is training
three blocks from our studio,

39:47.135 --> 39:49.012
"the Ford Mustang has been released,

39:49.137 --> 39:52.437
"it's one of the biggest news years
in the history of the world.

39:52.557 --> 39:56.607
"Why would I, a news guy,
want to travel with a band

39:56.728 --> 40:00.028
"that will be here in October
and gone in November?"

40:00.148 --> 40:02.150
MAN: Seconds out, round one.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.699
KANE: My bosses said, "You gotta go."

40:05.987 --> 40:09.332
My father pulled me aside
before I went on tour,

40:09.449 --> 40:10.996
and he said, "Watch your back.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.791
"These men are a menace to society."

40:16.331 --> 40:19.130
# It's been a hard day's night

40:20.084 --> 40:22.633
# And I've been working like a dog... #

40:23.379 --> 40:25.882
KANE: 'This is Larry Kane,
on tour with The Beatles.

40:26.007 --> 40:29.432
'Let me give you a little description of
the dangers of being with The Beatles.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.554
'When we drove up to the stage door,

40:31.679 --> 40:34.398
'The Beatles
were almost crushed completely

40:34.515 --> 40:37.735
'by youngsters who amassed themselves
against the wall,

40:37.852 --> 40:39.820
'broke about 50 windows,

40:39.938 --> 40:44.569
'throwed rocks, jelly beans,
undershirts, sandals.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.444
'The situation was one of sheer havoc,

40:46.569 --> 40:49.118
'even though the police
did their best to stop it.'

40:50.865 --> 40:54.335
The first couple days,
there was a bewilderment.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.125
There was a wondrousness.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.588
"Is this really happening to us?"

40:57.705 --> 41:01.005
'One girl stuck her hand through
the window and grabbed at my face.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.503
'I'm OK, don't worry, people,
I'm all right.'

41:04.462 --> 41:07.136
Four cities later, in Vancouver,
British Columbia,

41:07.256 --> 41:10.931
7,000 kids rushed the stage.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.830
Thank you, folks.
Before we do the next song...

41:32.073 --> 41:34.326
DEREK TAYLOR:
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.953
The Beatles have come
a long way to do this show,

41:37.078 --> 41:39.627
and we'll have to cut it short
unless you move back,

41:39.747 --> 41:41.795
cos they're very worried
about the situation in the front.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.886
Back.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.473
KANE: 240 kids wound up in the hospital.

41:48.589 --> 41:53.186
None of the police in any of these cities
were prepared for this.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.519
Nobody was prepared for this.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.389
REPORTER: Wouldn't you say, Derek,

41:56.514 --> 41:59.984
that police departments
don't realise how bad it is?

42:00.101 --> 42:01.353
TAYLOR: I think that's true.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.775
They've all seen crowds before.
I mean, they all say,

42:03.896 --> 42:06.740
"We know our own people.
We know the police potential,

42:06.858 --> 42:08.405
"and we're going to be able to handle it."

42:08.526 --> 42:10.244
But what they've never seen
is a Beatle crowd.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.864
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.538
There's no question about it.
It's like nothing before.

42:15.658 --> 42:19.413
It's not like Presley, it's not like Sinatra,
it's not like the late President Kennedy.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.336
It's The Beatles,
and they are without precedent.

42:23.791 --> 42:24.917
Thank you.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.553
Thank you very much, everybody. Ta.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.842
It's wonderful, thank you.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.308
Um, singing a song

42:32.425 --> 42:35.395
from the first album that we ever made.

42:35.511 --> 42:40.062
A song which was originally recorded
by a group called The Shirelles.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.686
- Just a minute, checking.
- Yeah.

42:42.810 --> 42:43.857
Yeah.

42:43.978 --> 42:46.231
Singing a song called Boys. Ringo!

42:53.112 --> 42:56.491
# I been told when a boy kiss a girl

42:56.616 --> 42:59.290
# Take a trip around the world, hey, hey

42:59.410 --> 43:01.538
# Bop shuop, bop-bop shuop

43:01.662 --> 43:04.461
- # Hey, now
- # Bop shuop, bop-bop shuop

43:04.582 --> 43:06.425
- # Hey, hey
- # Bop shuop

43:06.542 --> 43:08.465
# Whoa, she say you do

43:08.586 --> 43:10.213
# Bop shuop, yeah... #

43:11.589 --> 43:14.058
SIGOURNEY WEAVER:
I was way in the back, way at the top,

43:14.175 --> 43:17.224
surrounded by lots of girls

43:17.345 --> 43:21.725
really crying real tears
and so beside themselves.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.778
I felt as much as a girl can feel.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.363
I was in love with John.

43:28.064 --> 43:31.534
I remember spending all day
putting my hair in beer cans

43:31.651 --> 43:33.949
to make sure it was straight,
cos I had curly hair.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.196
Picking out the dress.

43:35.321 --> 43:40.293
Because of course they would see me,
along with 15,000 girls.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.912
It was this sense of world music

43:43.037 --> 43:45.210
that we were all loving them,
all over the world.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.669
# My girl says when I kiss her lips... #

43:49.794 --> 43:52.422
KANE: This is Larry Kane on-board
the Beatle Bird, as I call it.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.345
I have with me George Harrison.
How ya doin', George?

43:54.465 --> 43:56.308
I'm very well, Larry. And how are you?

43:56.425 --> 43:58.473
- Fine, are you glad to be back in America?
- Yeah, it's great.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.814
This is Larry Kane with The Beatles,
flying across America.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.274
With me I have Ringo Starr.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.941
Right over Kansas, 23,000 feet in the air,
on our way to Cincinnati.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.813
They had a wild one yesterday.

44:08.938 --> 44:11.441
On this exciting 25-city,
coast-to-coast tour.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.068
Atlantic City, Philadelphia.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.286
Well, let's talk a little bit
about the crowds at Indianapolis.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.997
Back and forth, again.
The stage set for Milwaukee tonight.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.492
You can hear the buzz and excitement
here in the Chicago Amphitheater.

44:20.616 --> 44:21.708
Now Detroit, Michigan.

44:21.826 --> 44:24.124
The Beatles really shook up
the crowds in Toronto.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.497
In Montreal, Canada.

44:25.621 --> 44:28.090
Hi, this is Larry Kane,
travelling with The Beatles.

44:28.207 --> 44:33.429
Let me explain to you the type of feeling
that you get after 15 performances,

44:33.546 --> 44:36.766
watching The Beatles in action
and watching the crowds.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.344
It's a chilling feeling inside,

44:39.468 --> 44:42.938
because you know you are experiencing
a phenomenon

44:43.055 --> 44:46.685
that is the only one of its kind
in the century thus far

44:46.809 --> 44:48.652
and that probably will go down in history

44:48.769 --> 44:54.026
as the greatest show business example
of music and admiration

44:54.150 --> 44:56.949
in many, many hundreds of years.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.867
# Ah... boys

44:58.988 --> 45:00.490
# Yeah, yeah, boys

45:00.615 --> 45:03.539
- # Don't you know I mean boys
- # Yeah, yeah, boys

45:03.659 --> 45:06.333
- # Talking about boys now
- # Yeah, yeah, boys

45:06.454 --> 45:09.458
- # Aah, ah!
- # Yeah, yeah, boys

45:09.582 --> 45:12.335
- # Talking about boys now
- # Yeah, yeah, boys

45:12.460 --> 45:14.713
# What a bundle of joy #

45:18.424 --> 45:19.801
Thank you!

45:22.720 --> 45:26.975
KANE: Remember, too, that in 1964
there were riots throughout the South

45:27.099 --> 45:29.227
because of the Civil Rights Movement.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.781
And you started to feel
a social change happening.

45:35.524 --> 45:38.323
'This is Larry Kane, and the big
question mark still is Jacksonville,

45:38.444 --> 45:40.947
'not knowing whether
they will be able to perform.'

45:41.072 --> 45:42.949
I'd received a report from my station

45:43.074 --> 45:46.044
that the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville
was gonna be segregated,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.709
so I mentioned it to them
in the interview.

45:48.829 --> 45:53.255
'What about this comment that I heard
about, uh... concerning racial integration

45:53.376 --> 45:55.470
'at the various performances?'

45:55.586 --> 45:57.805
PAUL: 'We don't like it if there's
any segregation or anything,

45:57.922 --> 45:59.674
'because it just seems mad to me.'

45:59.799 --> 46:02.803
KANE: And I could see Brian in the corner
of the room going like, "Oh, my God."

46:02.927 --> 46:04.679
'Well, you're gonna play
Jacksonville, Florida.

46:04.804 --> 46:07.102
'Do you anticipate any kind of difference
of that opinion?'

46:07.223 --> 46:10.477
PAUL: 'I don't know, really. You know,
it'd be a bit silly to segregate people,

46:10.601 --> 46:13.150
'cos, you know, I mean,
obviously it's stupid, you know.

46:13.271 --> 46:15.399
'You can't treat other human beings
like animals.'

46:15.523 --> 46:17.696
- JOHN: 'That's the way we all feel.'
- PAUL: 'That's the way we all feel,

46:17.817 --> 46:19.490
'and a lot of people in England
feel that way, you know.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.238
'cos there's never any segregation
in concerts in England,

46:22.363 --> 46:24.957
'and in fact if there was,
we wouldn't play 'em, you know.'

46:27.410 --> 46:29.162
KITTY OLIVER: During that same summer,

46:29.287 --> 46:33.008
we had the three civil rights workers
in the South who were missing,

46:34.959 --> 46:36.176
and then found dead.

46:39.046 --> 46:43.347
I was 15, living in segregation.

46:44.635 --> 46:50.187
It was an apartheid that's probably difficult
for a lot of people to even picture.

46:50.308 --> 46:54.654
The only white person
I would even have contact with

46:54.770 --> 46:58.616
was a salesman who would come
into the community.

46:59.525 --> 47:02.369
I was ripe for something different, I think,

47:02.486 --> 47:06.241
by the time I heard that
The Beatles were coming to town.

47:08.784 --> 47:12.163
KANE: All of them, by the way, were
very emphatic about Jacksonville.

47:12.288 --> 47:16.714
They said if there was going to be
segregation of any kind, we're not going.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.128
RINGO: We played to people,
that's what we did.

47:20.212 --> 47:24.012
We didn't play to, like, those people,
or that people, you know what I mean?

47:24.133 --> 47:25.601
We just played to people.

47:27.219 --> 47:31.599
KANE: It was amazing that the four
of them, young men, seeing the world,

47:31.724 --> 47:37.276
started to act up and blow back
on this very, very hot and sensitive issue,

47:37.396 --> 47:40.320
knowing that it would really irritate
a lot of Americans.

47:41.567 --> 47:46.619
PAUL: We had to all decide that
we agreed on a thing before we'd do it.

47:46.739 --> 47:49.492
That is, like, one of the classic things
about The Beatles.

47:49.617 --> 47:55.374
Four votes had to be carried
for any idea to go through.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.880
JOHN:
Instead of going for an individual thing,

47:58.000 --> 48:01.800
we went for the strongest format
and for equals.

48:01.921 --> 48:04.140
GEORGE: That was one thing
to be said about us.

48:04.256 --> 48:07.226
We were very, very close to each other.

48:07.343 --> 48:08.970
We'd always stick together.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.607
PAUL: We all had to agree,
so it was a strong decision.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.397
RINGO: You know, the proof's
in the pudding. It worked really well.

48:19.063 --> 48:22.863
OLIVER: It was my first concert,
and I went by myself.

48:22.983 --> 48:28.240
The only catch in my breath that I got
was when I went to my seat

48:28.364 --> 48:30.833
and there were
all those other people around me.

48:30.950 --> 48:33.920
And I still can feel that, to this day,

48:34.036 --> 48:36.209
that there were
all these white people around,

48:36.330 --> 48:38.674
but everyone standing up with everybody,

48:38.791 --> 48:43.467
and then just yelling as loud as I could
and singing along.

48:45.714 --> 48:48.217
# Me, I'm just the lucky kind

48:48.926 --> 48:50.894
# Love to hear you say

48:51.011 --> 48:53.890
# That love is luck,
and though we may... #

48:54.014 --> 48:57.518
OLIVER:
That was the first experience I had

48:57.643 --> 49:00.647
where it was possible to be around
people who were different,

49:00.771 --> 49:04.651
and at least for a while
those differences could disappear.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.948
# If I fell in love with you

49:07.069 --> 49:09.242
# Would you promise to be true

49:09.363 --> 49:13.869
# And help me understand... #

49:14.493 --> 49:18.418
KANE: The people who ran the Gator Bowl
integrated for the first time ever,

49:18.539 --> 49:20.962
which, from my historical perspective
and study,

49:21.083 --> 49:24.087
ended all that in most
of the big stadiums in the South.

49:25.129 --> 49:28.759
'And the next eight days are probably
the most gruelling of the tour.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.760
'Looks like The Beatles
are holding up strong.'

49:31.469 --> 49:35.349
Every night on the airplane,
they would walk up to the front of the plane

49:35.473 --> 49:37.567
where the opening acts were

49:38.142 --> 49:40.110
and kneel down and talk to them.

49:40.227 --> 49:43.822
Every single night,
they would ask them if they were OK.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.361
Because they were being ignored
by the crowd.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.778
'This is Larry Kane,
travelling with The Beatles.

49:48.903 --> 49:50.621
'And they're looking forward
to going back to England,

49:50.738 --> 49:54.333
'because they'll be there for two weeks,
where they'll record records of new music,

49:54.450 --> 49:57.124
'and then believe it or not,
another month-long tour,

49:57.244 --> 49:58.871
'this time of their own country,

49:58.996 --> 50:01.590
'sometimes just by bus,
and that's pretty hard.'

50:03.250 --> 50:06.345
My mother died in the summer of 1964,

50:06.462 --> 50:09.887
and somehow or other it got to them
that she had passed away,

50:10.007 --> 50:13.352
and Paul and John both consoled me.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.980
PAUL: John and I,
we'd both lost our mothers.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.690
Mine had died of cancer

50:18.807 --> 50:22.107
and his had died
in a terrible road accident.

50:22.770 --> 50:24.818
So that kind of pulled us together a lot.

50:24.939 --> 50:27.533
You know, being teenagers,
we just needed to do something

50:27.650 --> 50:29.778
that would get us away from this tragedy,

50:29.902 --> 50:32.200
and so songwriting was it, really.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.500
# Cos I couldn't stand the pain... #

50:37.451 --> 50:40.421
KANE: They were very, very sensitive
to other people's feelings.

50:40.538 --> 50:41.835
All four of them.

50:42.331 --> 50:44.959
They were intelligent people
who cared about other people,

50:45.084 --> 50:47.132
who had a sense of themselves.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.676
They also liked making fun of me.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.550
'John, last night, you were very kind
and Derek was very kind

50:52.675 --> 50:55.224
'to invite us up to see the movie,
which I have seen twice.'

50:55.344 --> 50:56.721
JOHN: 'I never invited him at all.

50:56.845 --> 50:58.813
'I just saw him sitting there,
listening to us.'

50:58.931 --> 51:02.231
- KANE: 'Well, anyway, uh...'
- JOHN: 'Only kidding, Larry.'

51:02.351 --> 51:04.900
KANE: 'This has been Larry Kane,
travelling with The Beatles.'

51:16.115 --> 51:18.709
HOWARD GOODALL: It's extraordinary,
when you think about it,

51:18.826 --> 51:22.000
that they were touring
in this kind of circus of life.

51:22.121 --> 51:25.341
The sort of madness
of all that jamboree, of excitement,

51:25.457 --> 51:26.959
and hysteria.

51:27.084 --> 51:30.554
And yet, they were able to express
the way they were feeling,

51:30.671 --> 51:32.093
the weirdness of it,

51:32.214 --> 51:37.846
because inside those Beatle suits
were composers. They were writers.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.356
- JOHN: Now I told you.
- PAUL: It was you, too George.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.100
JOHN: I said we'd miss out
on the middle eight.

51:43.225 --> 51:46.479
PAUL: Ah, you're coming in the wrong...
Halfway through the solo.

51:46.604 --> 51:50.074
- JOHN: What was it, 12 bar?
- Yeah...

51:51.108 --> 51:53.202
PAUL: The studio was like our little haven.

51:53.319 --> 51:56.914
Once we got back there,
we knew we could experiment.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.120
We could hear ourselves.

52:03.245 --> 52:07.500
And we would write songs
that would be a progression

52:07.625 --> 52:09.252
and that would be fun to record.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.349
GEORGE MARTIN: Brian Epstein and I

52:16.467 --> 52:19.641
worked together very closely
planning their future.

52:19.762 --> 52:23.608
We agreed that we should
put out a single every three months

52:23.724 --> 52:26.022
and an album every six months.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.861
# Baby's good to me, you know

52:27.978 --> 52:31.699
# She's happy as can be, you know,
she said so

52:34.068 --> 52:37.914
# I'm in love with her and I feel fine... #

52:38.822 --> 52:42.793
MARTIN: I was under pressure
because I'd got such little time with them.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.834
I would say to Brian, you know,
"I need more time in the studio."

52:45.954 --> 52:49.834
And he would dole out time
like giving scraps to a mouse.

52:49.958 --> 52:53.838
One of the great things
about our recording was the schedule.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.885
You'd go in a 10 o'clock in the morning,

52:56.006 --> 52:58.509
tune up, have a ciggy,
have a cup of tea or something,

52:58.634 --> 53:04.641
and then John and I mainly would present
the song that we'd written to everyone.

53:05.432 --> 53:06.979
It goes...

53:14.316 --> 53:16.159
Just go through it anyway, if it makes...

53:16.276 --> 53:18.244
Make mistakes... just to practice it.

53:18.362 --> 53:19.454
Try to remember, John,

53:19.571 --> 53:22.620
and if I don't, well,
it's just too bad, isn't it? OK?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.793
Is it just me and you?

53:24.910 --> 53:26.662
One, two, three, four.

53:26.787 --> 53:29.666
# Ooh... #

53:31.458 --> 53:33.927
- Oh, no, that's too much.
- You daft git!

53:34.044 --> 53:36.718
- Take two!
- One, two, three, four.

53:36.839 --> 53:40.389
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

53:40.509 --> 53:43.433
# Ooh, ooh

53:44.054 --> 53:47.524
# Ooh, I need your love, babe

53:47.641 --> 53:50.144
# Guess you know it's true

53:50.269 --> 53:51.816
PAUL: Ringo would tap along,

53:51.937 --> 53:55.237
George would just suss the chords,
and then George Martin would go,

53:55.357 --> 53:57.530
"Oh, yeah, that's half nice,
it was marvellous,"

53:57.651 --> 53:59.528
and then it would take about
20 minutes to do that.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.121
# Love me... #

54:01.238 --> 54:02.410
JOHN: What are you doing?

54:02.531 --> 54:04.625
PAUL: George, what did it sound like
with the bass doing a funny thing?

54:04.742 --> 54:06.415
Did it sound good
or did it sound just utterly crap?

54:06.535 --> 54:09.038
MARTIN: Thank you,
I think it's a good idea.

54:09.163 --> 54:11.211
ALL: No, no...

54:11.707 --> 54:14.586
- MARTIN: Take three.
- PAUL: One, two, three, four.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.553
# Ooh... #

54:18.464 --> 54:19.761
RINGO: At the very beginning,

54:19.882 --> 54:23.762
George Martin was the only man
who could press the button to record.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.730
We'd just play it and do it.
"Ah, did you get that, George?"

54:28.474 --> 54:29.817
MARTIN: I'm getting that, yes.

54:29.933 --> 54:31.981
- JOHN: Wonderful.
- MARTIN: That's lovely.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.901
PAUL: Keep that one. Mark it "fab".

54:35.022 --> 54:37.445
JOHN: You wanna have a listen
before we go onto the next one?

54:38.275 --> 54:41.404
PAUL: George had recorded the Goons.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.747
That was like a cult thing
that we all loved and we all knew it.

54:44.490 --> 54:46.913
MARTIN: At that time,
I was a comedy producer,

54:47.034 --> 54:49.162
recording Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers

54:49.286 --> 54:51.539
and a lot of English comedy actors.

54:51.663 --> 54:53.290
PAUL: So he picked up our humour,

54:53.415 --> 54:56.669
he picked up our camaraderie, you know.

54:56.794 --> 54:59.263
We thought, "Well, he's mad. We love him."

54:59.379 --> 55:00.505
MARTIN: Ready yet in there?

55:00.631 --> 55:02.429
JOHN: Oh, we'll just have to
have a go of it.

55:02.549 --> 55:04.893
- MARTIN: Oh, you're right...
- JOHN: I know.

55:05.928 --> 55:08.932
On the early records,
George Martin was a god.

55:09.056 --> 55:11.229
MARTIN: To begin with,
I was very much in charge,

55:11.350 --> 55:14.069
because I was a kind of schoolmaster
teaching them everything.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.904
And they had to do what I told them.

55:16.021 --> 55:20.322
PAUL: You had one and a half hours
from 10:30 to finish that song.

55:20.442 --> 55:22.911
Boom. So that focused you.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.621
That was a great discipline.

55:27.533 --> 55:30.161
- PAUL: We'll do it again.
- JOHN: So, we'll try and get it good, too.

55:30.285 --> 55:31.787
MARTIN: I'm just gonna start
recording you.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.914
Red light's on.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.632
RINGO: Every minute of the day,

55:36.416 --> 55:38.339
someone wanted something, you know?

55:38.460 --> 55:40.633
Drive to EMI to do a record,

55:40.754 --> 55:44.099
down here to Soho to do a photo shoot.

55:46.927 --> 55:49.430
Drive back to do some TV show.

55:49.555 --> 55:53.355
# I'm a loser

55:53.475 --> 55:56.820
# And I'm not what I appear to be

55:56.937 --> 55:58.405
# Of all... #

55:58.522 --> 56:00.820
I was singing the wrong words there.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.114
Drive to Birmingham to do a gig.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.867
End up in a nightclub.

56:05.988 --> 56:09.618
We were just doing
four or five things a day, you know,

56:09.741 --> 56:13.211
but we had each other.
And we brought that to the music.

56:14.413 --> 56:17.212
# Ooh, I need your love, babe

56:17.749 --> 56:20.093
# Guess you know it's true

56:21.253 --> 56:24.302
# Hope you need my love, babe

56:24.423 --> 56:27.097
# Just like I need you... #

56:28.927 --> 56:30.850
GOODALL: The thing about the scale is

56:30.971 --> 56:33.440
that writing lots of songs
is not particularly difficult.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.230
Volume is not the thing.

56:35.350 --> 56:38.399
The extraordinary thing about The Beatles
is the amount of great songs.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.147
Schubert wrote about 800 songs,

56:40.272 --> 56:43.025
of which probably 100
are absolutely beautiful melodies.

56:43.150 --> 56:44.777
The other 700, pretty good.

56:44.902 --> 56:48.907
The only comparison with that kind of level
of melody, maybe Mozart?

56:49.406 --> 56:52.080
Very, very high volume
and very good melodies.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.793
You have to wait a long time, then,

56:53.911 --> 56:56.209
till you get someone
who's up in the hundreds,

56:56.330 --> 56:58.048
and that's when you get The Beatles.

56:58.165 --> 57:00.167
Which is why I think
you can compare them in some ways,

57:00.292 --> 57:02.010
because the sheer volume of the invention.

57:02.544 --> 57:06.048
# I ain't got nothing but love, girl

57:06.506 --> 57:08.133
# Eight days a week

57:10.010 --> 57:12.433
# Eight days a week... #

57:26.735 --> 57:29.079
EPSTEIN: Hello again
from Hullabaloo, London.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.870
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Richard Lester.

57:36.787 --> 57:40.007
Richard, what do you think we could
tell them about the new Beatles flick?

57:40.123 --> 57:42.546
Well, first of all, it's going to be
different from the last one.

57:42.668 --> 57:43.965
It'll be in colour.

57:44.086 --> 57:47.636
It'll be a film that has a lot of plot,
a lot of entertainment about it,

57:47.756 --> 57:49.349
and Ringo's in trouble again.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.761
We need protection,
we've got a record to do tomorrow.

57:52.886 --> 57:53.978
I need protection.

57:54.096 --> 57:56.394
And you shall have it. Get me protection.

57:56.515 --> 57:58.643
(# THE BEATLES: "I NEED YOU")

57:59.977 --> 58:04.403
# You don't realise how much I need you

58:06.984 --> 58:11.364
# Love you all the time
and never leave you

58:13.490 --> 58:16.790
# Please come on back to me

58:16.910 --> 58:20.084
# I'm lonely as can be

58:20.205 --> 58:21.627
# I need you... #

58:24.042 --> 58:27.137
PAUL: We'd enjoyed very much doing
A Hard Day's Night.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.552
We had kinda taken it seriously,

58:29.673 --> 58:34.053
but with the film Help!
we were kinda pretty disinterested.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.521
You know, we were now doing it again,

58:37.347 --> 58:40.817
and so it couldn't be quite as exciting
as the first time. Nothing is.

58:44.813 --> 58:49.660
The main thing I remember is,
we all had meetings about tax structure

58:49.776 --> 58:51.403
and they would sorta say,

58:51.528 --> 58:54.998
oh you've gotta put your money
in the Bahamas or somewhere.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.618
So when we were asked about the film,

58:57.743 --> 58:59.461
we would say, "Can we go to The Bahamas?"

58:59.578 --> 59:03.082
We were told, you're gonna film
in the Bahamas. Write a scene.

59:03.206 --> 59:05.629
(# THE BEATLES: "IT'S ONLY LOVE")

59:11.548 --> 59:16.520
# I get high when I see you go by

59:18.638 --> 59:19.810
# My oh my... #

59:19.931 --> 59:24.778
KANE: In 1965, they invited me to Nassau
to watch them film the movie Help!

59:24.895 --> 59:27.865
I walked into the house
and I saw something very unusual.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.700
They were all high on marijuana.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.244
And I'd never seen this before.

59:33.361 --> 59:35.739
- KANE: Hey Paul, how you doin'?
- PAUL: Hello, Larry.

59:35.864 --> 59:38.162
- KANE: Good to see you again.
- PAUL: Lovely to see you, yes.

59:38.283 --> 59:40.502
KANE: Hey, John. How are you doin'?

59:45.874 --> 59:48.047
What is this everything...
anything can happen business?

59:54.466 --> 59:56.343
- KANE: Thanks a lot.
- GEORGE: Anything. Larry?

59:56.468 --> 59:59.096
- KANE: We'll be talking to you.
- (LAUGHING)

59:59.805 --> 01:00:05.403
PAUL: In all truthfulness,
we spent a lot of that film slightly stoned.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.736
(# THE BEATLES: "TICKET TO RIDE")

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.994
Things were spiralling
like crazy during Help!

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:26.047
There were people coming in
with contracts for bubblegum royalties

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.586
and being condescending,

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.550
and then the press
were getting aggressive.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.840
They owned all of us.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.384
JOHN: There's no switching off.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:36.429
The elevator man wants a little piece
of you on the way back to your room.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.554
The maid wants a little piece of you
back at the hotel.

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:42.477
And I don't mean sexually, I mean
a piece of your time and your energy,

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.601
and it's like a politician,
you're on 24 hours a day.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.566
KANE: I think that John got fed up first.

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:52.317
He became agitated or frustrated
about what was being written,

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.034
particularly from 1965 onward.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.822
PAUL: Richard Lester
had said we need a song,

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.416
and John started it,

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:05.083
so by the time I came to see him,
he had a lot of it,

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.958
and he said to me, you know,
this is kind of autobiographical.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.627
You know, "When I was younger,
so much younger than today..."

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.173
I knew what he meant,

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.094
you know, and I knew now
he was more insecure

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.684
cos we were all a bit more insecure
than we'd been when we were 17.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:21.804
One, two, three, four!

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:22.975
# Help!

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.144
- # I need somebody
- # Help!

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.688
- # Not just anybody
- # Help!

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.402
# You know I need someone

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.987
# Help!

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:36.701
# When I was younger,
so much younger than today

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:41.035
# I never needed anybody's help in any way

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:47.080
# But now these days are gone,
I'm not so self-assured

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.502
# Now I find I've changed my mind

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.967
# And opened up the doors

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:55.804
# Help me if you can, I'm feeling down

01:01:56.504 --> 01:02:00.850
# And I do appreciate you being round

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:06.648
# Help me get my feet back on the ground

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:10.360
# Won't you please, please help me

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:16.867
# And now my life has changed
in oh so many ways

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:21.496
# My independence
seems to vanish in the haze

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:26.668
# But now these days are gone
I'm not so self-assured

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:32.044
# I know that I just need you like
I've never done before

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:36.587
# Help me if you can,
I'm feeling down... #

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.803
JOHN: I always liked Help,
because I meant it, it's real.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:44.724
The lyric is as good now as it was then,
there's no difference to it.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.063
It was just me singing "Help,"
and I meant it.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.650
# Won't you please, please help me

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:55.648
# Help me, help me, ooh #

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.328
RINGO: We were not getting
a lot of money from records.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.041
We had the worst deal in the world,

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:10.002
but we had a deal and we were on vinyl,
and that's all that mattered.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:14.254
You've gotta remember,
we made our money playing live.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.502
# Well, they took some honey

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.044
# From a tree

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:21.806
# Dressed it up and they called it me

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.301
# Everybody's trying to be my baby

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:26.929
# Everybody's trying to be my baby

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.932
# Everybody's trying
to be my baby, now... #

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.058
RINGO: It just got bigger
and bigger and bigger.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.777
# Well half past nine, half past four

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.192
# Fifty women knocking on my door

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.858
# Everybody's trying to be my baby

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.861
# Everybody's trying to be my baby

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.081
# Everybody's trying
to be my baby, now, yeah... #

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:47.950
And then it got crazy.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.215
They went back to America
and started playing stadiums,

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.256
places like Portland, San Francisco,

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.300
the Metropolitan Stadium in Minneapolis,

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.844
the Chicago White Sox's Kaminski Park.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.220
# Went out last night, I didn't stay late

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.688
# 'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates...
#

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.102
KANE: There were lots of other groups
touring at this point,

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.600
but nothing like this.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:15.819
The money they were making
night after night

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.905
compared to other acts was unprecedented.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.614
The fact is, they had to play stadiums.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.864
Promoters and local police
had to be begging Brian Epstein,

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:30.333
telling him, you know, you can't go
and play a 5,000-seat theatre

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:34.205
and have 50,000 teenagers
going crazy outside.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.297
It will be impossible to control.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:41.844
This was massive.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:45.056
The first big stadium tour in history,

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:48.643
and the biggest show of them all
was New York.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:55.108
GOLDBERG: There was
the announcement of this concert

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.602
and I was like, "Can we go?"

01:04:56.726 --> 01:05:00.026
And my mum was like,
"We don't have the money for this."

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:05.194
And then, something...
I don't know how she did it.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.821
I don't know...

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:11.541
I don't know how she did it,
but she got two tickets.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.419
And she didn't tell me.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.589
So, this is what happened.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.673
She said, "We need to go,"
and I said, "Where are we going?

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.759
She said, "I'll let you know
when we get there."

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.925
OK, so we're on the train
and I'm not paying any attention.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.887
And we get up and I ask, "Where are we?"

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.601
And she says, "We're at Shea Stadium."

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.265
And I said, "Why?"

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:37.184
And she held up two tickets,
and all I remember is my head going poof.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.868
JOHN: It's just amazing, it's unbelievable.

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:53.117
- RINGO: The biggest thing ever.
- PAUL: 56,500 someone said. It's fantastic.

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:54.993
GEORGE: It just knocks you out, you know?

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.630
Shea Stadium is an enormous place.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:03.047
I mean, that was the first time
it was used for a rock concert.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:07.799
Vox made us special big amplifiers
for that tour

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.300
and they were like a hundred watts...

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.849
And it just obviously,
you know, wasn't enough.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.892
ED SULLIVAN: Now ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.652
here are The Beatles.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.450
Here they come.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.503
- Hello.
- Oh, oh!

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.221
- Hello!
- Hey!

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.056
- Hello!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.591
Hello!

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.268
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, John.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:07:00.900
We'd like to do a song from...
What LP is it on?

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:05.147
Off our LP album, Beatles VI, I think.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.365
Can you hear me?

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:09.821
Hello?

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.780
And it's called, Dizzy Miss Lizzy.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:36.060
# You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.230
# The way you rock and roll

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.646
# You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:46.237
# When we do the stroll

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:49.399
# Come on, come on, come on,
come on, Lizzy

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.076
# Love me before I grow too old

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:56.827
# Run and tell your mama

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.416
# I want you to be my bride... #

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:01.286
COSTELLO: One of the most remarkable
things about The Beatles playing live is

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:02.958
how in tune they are,

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.457
because they can't possibly
hear themselves.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.175
I don't think they had monitors.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:08.509
Amps aren't very big.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.425
Even if they were cranked to the max
they're not that loud.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.507
I mean, Shea Stadium
being the most extraordinary...

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.600
because I don't even think
there's a P.A. at Shea Stadium.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:18.310
They're going through the Tannoy,

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.898
which must have sounded like a thousand
transistor radios to each ear.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.437
# Miss Lizzy

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.486
# Girl, you look so fine

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.903
# Just a-rocking and a-rolling

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:34.073
# Girl I said I wish you were mine... #

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.363
RINGO: We did the house P.A., you know,

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:42.288
and on first base is Willy Wonka,
or whatever they said.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.412
That's the equipment we had.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.340
# When you rock and roll... #

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.175
RINGO: I could not hear anything.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.296
I'd be watchin' John's arse, Paul's arse,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.798
his foot's tappin', his head's noddin',

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.515
to see where we were in the song.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.225
# Come on, come on, Lizzy

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:01.313
# I wanna be your lover man #

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.822
PAUL: Playing to 56,000 people
at Shea Stadium,

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:15.944
after that, you just sort of think
to yourself, what more can you do?

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.410
NEIL ASPINALL: I remember
George bringing up the subject with Brian,

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:24.411
"Hey, is this touring
gonna be an annual event?"

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.457
And I think he was the first one
that brought up the idea of,

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.754
"Hey, I've had enough of this."

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:35.171
GEORGE: That was the good thing
about being four together.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.889
You're not like Elvis, you know?

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.100
I always felt sorry for Elvis
cos he was on his own.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.970
He had his guys with him,
but there's only one Elvis.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:44.314
Nobody else knew what he felt like.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.733
But, for us, we all shared the experience.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.699
JON SAVAGE: They came back to England
late summer '65.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:01.160
The last time The Beatles
played in Britain was that winter,

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.408
you know, seven or eight dates.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.581
My grandparents
bought me tickets to see them,

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.921
and my parents refused to let me go.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.132
# Got a good reason

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.924
# For taking the easy way out... #

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:18.799
The Beatles captured my imagination
like no other group at that point.

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.267
It was the way that I began
to interpret the world.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:25.096
Each new record
was built on the record before.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:29.317
You had this wonderful storyline
advancing through with The Beatles.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:33.064
By the end of the year we were being told
there would be more records forthcoming.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.284
And they went back in the studio.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.324
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.833
JOHN: See if we're all in tune
when we play, George.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.126
MARTIN: Girl, take one.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:59.010
# Is there anybody
going to listen to my story

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.555
# All about the girl who came to stay... #

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.929
COSTELLO: The first reaction to the new,
innovative sound of Rubber Soul was,

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:08.602
I don't like this.
I think they've lost their minds.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.268
# Girl, girl... #

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:13.565
What are they thinking,
you know, what's this?

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:18.032
# She's the kind of girl
who puts you down when friends are there

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:20.151
# You feel a fool... #

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.200
I kinda went from being a kid
to being a teenager, so...

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:25.540
some of those things
felt like the right thing,

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.876
but it was still surprising,
this group I like kinda change so much.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.291
# Girl... #

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.424
There's a big jump from
I Want To Hold YourHand to

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.635
"Was she told when she was young
that pain would lead to pleasure."

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:43.133
# Was she told when she was young
that pain would lead to pleasure

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:47.311
# Did she understand it
when they said... #

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.727
I didn't understand it at all when I heard it.
I didn't think it was any good.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.442
And then six weeks later,
you couldn't live without the record.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.612
And that's good. That's when you trust
the people who make music

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.652
to take you somewhere
that you hadn't been before.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:04.821
RADIO: 'Formal occasion at Buckingham
Palace on a foggy October morning.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.623

probably done as much for popular music

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.634
'as people like Rodgers and Hammerstein

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.636

INTERVIEWER: 'What's the M.B.E.
going to do to your teenage rebel image?'

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.279
- Who's got a teenage rebel image?
- Well, you have.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:40.444
- Have we?
- No.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.408
Have any of you any ambitions left at all?

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.277
- John?
- I'd like to be a duke.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.539
# Have you heard the word is love... #

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.876
SAVAGE: They had achieved the summit,
and they were, if you like, emperors,

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:54.542
but at the same time
they were prisoners of their fame,

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:57.962
and I think they were beginning to chafe
at people's expectations.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.308
The first three months had been lopped off

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:15.150
to do whatever The Beatles' third film
was going to be, and then it didn't happen.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:19.521
And so for the first time since
they'd become successful and famous,

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.272
they had three months off.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.695
(# THE BEATLES: "NORWEGIAN WOOD")

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.997
GEORGE: It had been four years for us
of legging around in this mania,

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.204
and we were tired. We needed a rest.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:39.048
# I once had a girl

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.008
# Or should I say

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.048
# She once had me... #

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.552
PAUL: The thing is that we were all
interested in other things

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:47.924
before The Beatles.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.970
And we didn't really have time,
but we were always lookin' around.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.971
I got involved with a gallery owner

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:57.600
and when we'd go to Paris
and buy paintings.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:14:00.069
We'd go to the dealer.
So it was very exciting.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:05.112
And of course, George had developed
an interest in Indian music.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.532
(# SITAR PLAYS)

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.710
GEORGE: I just wanna carry on
progressing with music,

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:19.080
you know, writing more
and just learning more about it.

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:23.672
I've written so many songs that I've just
thrown away as I've been writing them

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:27.798
because I've wanted,
when I finally recorded one of mine,

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:32.519
I wanted it to be, you know, worth puttin'
on the LP alongside Paul and John's.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:36.564
I feel now I've got more idea
about how to write songs.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:42.820
RINGO: We bought this house
in the country on this estate,

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:46.066
Maureen and Zak, my son,
and John was up the road.

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.531
We started to grow up,

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.620
and we started to have families,

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:55.867
and we started to put less energy
into The Beatle bag.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.457
We all kind of were very aware

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.330
that we didn't live
in each other's pockets anymore.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.878
We all had separate existences.

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:08.221
SAVAGE: There's an interview that
John Lennon gives to Maureen Cleave

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.762
which is published in March '66
where he talks about his reading,

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:15.136
he sorta says, "I'm not sure what
I'm going to do next, this isn't everything,"

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.434
which is not what a pop star
is supposed to say.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:22.523
That same month, March,
they were doing a photo shoot.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.313
JOHN: By then we were really sort of
beginning to hate it.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:27.406
This photo session was a big ordeal

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.572
and you had to try to look normal,
you know, and you didn't feel it.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.580
PAUL: Bob Whitaker was one of the
photographers who took our pictures

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:37.325
and he came up with,
we'd all put on white lab coats

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.329
and we'd pretend to be mad professors.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.047
JOHN: The photographer's
a bit of a surrealist, you know?

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:50.547
We really got into it,
and that's how we felt, like, "Yeah."

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.556
# To say about the things that you do... #

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.849
PAUL: To us, you know,
this wasn't a big deal, really,

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:01.520
because these kind of shocking things
were part of the art scene.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:08.486
# About the good things
that we can have if we close our eyes... #

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:11.826
JOHN: I expressly pushed for it
to be an album cover, you know?

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.740
It'd gone out in America,

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:15.579
and there was some kind of fuss.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.038
PAUL: It was like, "What?
My beloved Beatles?

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:21.001
"No! This must stop!"

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:23.829
MARTIN: Sorry.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.831
JOHN: Well, are you gonna
keep that one, please?

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:28.379
- MARTIN: Why don't you leave that one on?
- GEORGE: Yeah, just leave it out again.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:29.844
PAUL: OK.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.008
JOHN: I'll just have to vamp it up a bit.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.053
Now he tells me.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:37.393
RINGO: We're having more fun
in the studio.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:38.978
It's getting more experimental.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.065
The songs were gettin' better,
more interesting.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.685
# When I wake up early in the morning

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.066
# Lift my...

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.277
# And I'm still... #

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.570
RINGO: There weren't, like, big plans.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.820
You know, sometimes it just unfolded.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.367
Complete fluke.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.957
JOHN: OK, ready?

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.246
RINGO: John was not mechanically minded,

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.294
and he took a tape on,

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:10.634
and the tape had run off to the other reel,

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:13.550
and he put it on like it was the start,

01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:16.550
but it was the end of the song
and that's when the guitar came.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.472
(IMITATES SOUND)

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.971
And he brings it in,
"Ah, you've gotta hear this."

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:25.225
And we said, great,
we've gotta do that, so...

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.896
Call in the boffins.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:34.735
# Lay down all thoughts,
surrender to the void

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.781
# It is shining #

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.829
PAUL: And I always remember
being in Brian Epstein's house

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:46.671
and John playing it to Brian
and to George Martin,

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.585
and saying, "What do you think of this?"
you know.

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:52.961
But you could see this puzzlement
going across their faces,

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.712
but instead of saying,

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.807
"Ah, come on, guys, I think
you really oughta put another chord in,"

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:01.052
he knew to leave us alone by then.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.147
# It is shining... #

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.187
You can slow down or speed up the tape.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.027
You can put it in backwards time.
You can put in electronic sounds.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.942
And this is the kind of thing
you can do on a recording,

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.156
but you obviously
couldn't possibly play it live

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.446
because it is, in fact,
making up music as you go along.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:26.828
GOODALL: Tomorrow Never Knows
breaks so many barriers,

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:30.001
musically speaking, and does so many
things that no one had done before.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.501
It's got a drone all the way through, which
is something that happens in Indian music,

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.596
and used to exist in Western music
in the 12th century.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.885
So, it sort of triggered a whole movement

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:42.180
that popular music would start to bring in
these influences from the avant-garde

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:44.144
and put them into mainstream songs,

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.184
into an album
that millions of people would hear.

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:52.236
# That love is all and love is everyone

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.067
# It is knowing... #

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:59.819
RINGO: You know, when we first started,
we were the nice, clean mop tops,

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:02.572
and every mother's son
and everyone loved us.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:06.997
And then suddenly, you know, there's
a few things that they don't understand.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:08.539
It's just, we're men now, you know?

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:11.210
We're a bit older than those lads
that started out.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.842
You can't live all your life
by what they want.

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:19.089
You know, we can't go on forever
as four clean little mop tops

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:20.214
playing, She Loves You.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.231
# Of the beginning

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.816
# Of the beginning... #

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.311
GEORGE: Then we were back on the road.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:37.691
We got on a train and went up to Hamburg.

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.159
RINGO: By then I don't think
we wanted to be anywhere.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.574
It was like automatic pilot, you know?

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:47.075
There was so much more pressure
from the press trying to get at you,

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.826
you know, for whatever reason.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.248
- We're not horrid snobby.
- Yes, you are.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.920
- No, we seem like...
- That's your version.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.918
Maybe it's only in your mind that we are.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.045
Because we're not flattering you.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.551
You know, you expect sort of
nice answers to all the questions,

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:08.770
but if the questions aren't nice questions,
they don't have to have nice answers.

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.640
And if we don't give nice answers,
it doesn't mean we're snobby.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.483
It just means we're natural.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.398
(CLAPPING)

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.232
GEORGE: Everything
was hit-and-run in those days,

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.575
and I think the next day
after the Hamburg concert,

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.194
we had a flight to Tokyo.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.488
(MAN SPEAKS JAPANESE)

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:30.250
RINGO: It's amazing security.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.586
I've never seen so many people
guarding us.

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:35.206
MAN: So we don't want you
to be hurt or anything,

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.208
so we're trying our best.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:42.213
GEORGE: Everywhere we were going,
it was a demonstration

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.136
of one thing or another.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.054
In Japan, the people were demonstrating

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.975
because the Budokan was supposed to be
a special, spiritual hall

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:52.689
and only reserved for martial arts,

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.433
not pop music.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.774
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.489
we welcome... The Beatles.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.007
GEORGE: It was very strange.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.092
The audience were very reserved,

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.087
respectful,

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:26.341
very quiet to what we had
become accustomed to.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:27.466
Very quiet.

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:35.357
One, two, three, four!

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:39.024
# He's a real nowhere man

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:42.899
# Sitting in his nowhere land

# Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody #

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.823
RINGO: We were playing crap.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:53.417
We were just sort of surviving.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.164
# Knows not where he's going to

01:21:58.288 --> 01:22:02.668
# Isn't he a bit like you and me... #

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:08.098
PAUL: We had a day off
in the Philippines, in Manila,

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:12.345
and then somebody said,
you're supposed to be visiting the palace.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.940
RINGO: Madam Marcos
had invited us to dinner,

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.900
and Brian had told her no.

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.520
Then the next morning
someone brought the newspapers,

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.694
"Beatles Snub President."

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.529
GEORGE: By '66,
it felt dangerous, you know?

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.247
Because everybody was out of hand,

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.662
and even the cops were out of line.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.911
You know, they were all just caught up
in the mania.

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:40.631

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:43.967
and also, dissatisfaction and frustration.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:46.257
And now they went straight
into a complete nightmare.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:47.971
Now, this religious controversy,

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:49.590
I know you don't want to say
too much about it,

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.968
but does it worry you that it's going to
boil up when you get to the States?

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.390
Well, it worries me, yes, but I...

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.639
I hope everything will be all right
in the end, as they say.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:58.857
Do you think this is going to be
a controversial tour,

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.100
like the Philippines was?

Oh, no, no.

No, it's gonna be fine.

- Oh, it will be fine.

# Good day sunshine... #

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:22.001
KANE: It was all because of that interview
John had given while on vacation.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:25.092
It was reprinted in America months later.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:28.179
"Lennon says The Beatles
are bigger than Christ."

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:34.556
PAUL: At that time, churches
were losing their congregations,

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.020
people were going to church
less and less and less.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.608
John was saying, "We're so famous!
You wouldn't believe the fame.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.653
"I mean, like, we're bigger than Jesus."

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.115
It was a harmless remark
in the middle of an article,

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:55.365
and it never made the front page
in England.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.039
KANE: That unleashed a firestorm
in the United States.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:02.379
SAVAGE: It was almost like
the plot of Help! had become real,

01:24:02.496 --> 01:24:06.342
and they actually had a lot of people
who suddenly wanted to dismember them.

broadcasting at 1220 on your dial,
until about nine o'clock this morning,

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:15.809
and we'd like to urge you to take
your Beatle records and your Beatlemania

01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:19.851
to any one of our 14 pickup points
anywhere in Birmingham, Alabama.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.440
And don't forget, the destruction...

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.151
the destruction of those Beatle records
will take place just a few days,

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.566
and we'll keep you informed on all of that.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.865
They were just stunned.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.609
You have to really put it in perspective,

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.282
I mean the whole scandal was very serious,

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.202
partly because of the violence
that was in America at the time.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.287
You just had the Texas Sniper,
Charles Whitman,

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.210
who just shot dead 20 people.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.544
This was the same country
only three years before

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:53.548
where the President had been assassinated.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:57.427
It had got dangerous,
and we were threatened.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:01.814
PAUL: We knew
we weren't being blasphemous,

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.524
we weren't anti-Jesus.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:07.815
In fact, we all had
pretty religious upbringings, really,

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.940
but you do see John
as sort of a broken man,

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:13.529
cos he realised, he had to apologise.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.324
It was gonna be
the only thing that would stop this.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:20.120
I was pointing out that fact,
in reference to England,

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.244
that we meant more to kids than Jesus did,

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.416
or religion, at that time.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:29.883
I wasn't knocking it or putting it down,
I was just saying it, as a fact.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.346
And it sort of... it is true,
especially more for England than here.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:37.307
But I'm not saying
that we're better or greater,

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:40.348
or comparing us
with Jesus Christ as a person,

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.642
or God as a thing, or whatever it is.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:45.357
You know, I just said what I said,
and it was wrong,

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.351
or was taken wrong, and now it's all this.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.901
PAUL: He's longing to break out of it,
and do a joke,

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:53.524
but he knows he can't.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.823
If I had said television
is more popular than Jesus,

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:58.786
I might have got away with it.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.033
You know, but as I just happened
to be talking to a friend,

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.330
I used the word Beatles,

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.294
as a remote thing, not as what I think,

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:10.166
because Beatles, as those other Beatles,
like other people see us.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.633
I just said they are...

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.220
are having more influence
on kids and things

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.010
than anything else, including Jesus,

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:19.553
but I said it in that way,

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.473
which is the wrong way, yep, yep.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:22.765
PAUL: He was scared.

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.809
We were all pretty scared.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.809
RINGO: Most of the people in the room
understood it.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:30.277
It's like one of those lines.

01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:32.237
But it... it didn't hold us back at all.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:36.317
REPORTER: Concert tomorrow night is far
below a sell-out, how do you feel about...

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.068
Very rich.

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.501
# My love don't give me presents

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:51.297
# I know that she's no peasant... #

01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:55.469
ED FREEMAN: There were three
road managers, roadies,

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:58.589
on the tour, period, in '66, that was it.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:27:02.014
I was friends with the opening act.
They said, "You want to do it?"

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:04.728
and I didn't even know
how to set up a drum kit at the time.

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:05.892
I had no idea.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:08.891
I was a musician in Boston,
I was a folk singer.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:11.313
I had no qualifications at all.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.770
RINGO: We only ever had
a couple of roadies.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.613
Didn't matter where we were,

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:18.234
biggest band in the land,
that's all we had.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:23.372
In Cleveland, the sound was so bad
that everybody rushed the stage.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.162
REPORTER: 'Cleveland Stadium
has been absolutely riots,

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:28.251
'the whole place went wild here,

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:31.212
'broke the barriers,
came through the police cordon.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.331
'We managed to get The Beatles
off the stage.

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:35.459
'They were even all over the stage.'

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.586
FREEMAN: I really thought
I was gonna get hurt.

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:42.090
We get to Memphis,
and there's been a bomb scare,

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:44.217
and we had to delay the show

01:27:44.342 --> 01:27:47.186
while they put bomb-sniffing dogs
throughout the whole theatre.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:51.316
GEORGE: That kind of stuff was happening
all the time. It was terrifying.

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:54.403
Some people would set off firecrackers
in the hall,

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:57.068
and you'd think someone of the others
got shot or something.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.454
FREEMAN: Then we flew off to St. Louis,
and it was pouring rain.

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.198
# She was a day tripper

01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:09.998
# One way ticket, yeah... #

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:14.339
My job was to sit backstage
with my hand on the plug,

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:15.708
and the instructions were

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:19.257
if one of them fell down,
like knocked out by the shock,

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:22.096
then you should pull the plug,
and that would stop the show.

01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:24.596
It was a joke.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.729
This was three weeks that they
just took a deep breath and said,

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:35.318
"OK, well, let's just do this,
and we'll make a lot of money."

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.951
PAUL: A lot of the time we were going
through the motions,

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:46.948
and we all started to get pretty fed up.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:50.246
George particularly was quite
sort of vocal about that.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:56.298
GEORGE: I was saying, "I don't want to
do this anymore. I don't like this."

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.792
I certainly felt that that was it,

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:02.091
you know, that we weren't gonna
tour again like that.

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:29.535
JOHN: There was
no enjoyment in it, you know.

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:31.658
The music wasn't being heard.

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:35.162
It wasn't doing anything,
it was just a sort of freak show.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:41.051
The Beatles were the show,
and the music had nothing to do with it.

01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:46.173
As we were musicians,

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.141
we felt, if we're gonna be Beatles,

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:50.477
the only reason to be Beatles
is to make music,

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.722
and not be in a circus.

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:01.104
PAUL: And when we were finished,

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.984
I remember just being piled
in the back of this meat wagon,

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:08.112
which was steel, and nothing else inside.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:14.460
We were all in there, sorta sliding around
as it went around the corners.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.455
And we're all like really mad
at the whole bloody thing.

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:20.173
John started like, you know, George...

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.008
"That's it, I've had enough, you know."

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:24.795
And we all agreed.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:30.350
RINGO: You know, we're just in the band,
saying, "That's enough of that."

(# PIANO PLAYS)

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:48.990
RINGO: We all knew, I mean,
to, like, survive,

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:53.991
we had to get back in the studio
and get to know each other and play again.

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.831
Well, I'm not holding back, George.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:59.171
I'm giving my all.

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:02.211
GEORGE: It used to make us laugh
when we'd read people saying,

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:03.754
"The problem with The Beatles is

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:06.594
"that when we were all growing up,
they were all on tour,

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.964
"and so they missed
the growing up period."

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:12.514
But the truth to it was
that we were snatched out of our youth.

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.011
We were forced grown,

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:17.309
like rhubarb when you grow it
under hothouse conditions,

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:19.683
you make it grow much quicker
than it would naturally.

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:21.856

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:23.320

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.113
JOHN: All right, let's go.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:36.412
In one way it was good,
because we went into the recording scene,

01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:39.503
and really sort of expressed ourselves
through the records then,

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:41.371

# It's getting hard to be someone,

PAUL: I'd got this idea for us
to all be someone else.

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:04.148
Because we were so fed up
with being what we were.

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:06.567

we're not The Beatles.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:29.469
It was to liberate us.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:32.384

a new name for ourselves,

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.304
gonna think up a new way of being,

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:44.049
# And if somebody loved me like she does

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.601
# Ooh, she does

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:50.020
# Yes, she does

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:55.686
# Don't let me down

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.653
# Don't let me down

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:07.993
# Don't let me down

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:13.661
# Don't let me down

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:19.126
# I'm in love for the first time

01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:25.344
# Don't you know it's gonna last

01:37:28.217 --> 01:37:31.061
# It's a love that lasts forever

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:37.436
# It's a love that has no past

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:46.694
# I've got a feeling

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:51.165
# That keeps me on my toes, oh yeah

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:54.167
- # Oh, yeah
- # Oh, yeah

01:37:56.954 --> 01:37:59.002
# I've got a feeling

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:02.468
# I think that everybody knows, oh yeah

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:06.806
- # Oh, yeah
- # Oh, yeah

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:09.225
# Oh, yeah

01:38:09.342 --> 01:38:12.312
# Yeah, yeah

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:15.439
# I've got a feeling, yeah

01:38:19.936 --> 01:38:22.405
# Everybody had a hard year

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:24.737
# Everybody had a good time

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.452
# Everybody had a wet dream

01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:30.533
# Everybody saw the sunshine

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:32.123
- # Oh, yeah
- # Oh, yeah

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.789
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:39.331
- # Well...
- # Everybody had a good year

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.584
# Everybody let their hair down

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:46.004
- # Everybody pulled their socks up
- # Yeah

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.632
# Everybody put their foot down, oh, yeah

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:56.305
# Yeah

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.109
# Woo-hoo

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.938
- # I've got a feeling
- # Everybody had a good year

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:06.236
- # A feeling deep inside, oh, yeah
- # Everybody had a hard time

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:09.236
- # Everybody had a wet dream
- # Oh, yeah

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.283
# Everybody saw the sunshine

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:14.457
- # I've got a feeling
- # Everybody had a good year

01:39:14.574 --> 01:39:17.874
- # A feeling I can't hide, oh, no
- # Everybody let their hair down

01:39:17.994 --> 01:39:20.838
- # Everybody pulled their socks up
- # Oh, no, no

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:23.504
- # Everybody put their foot down
- # Yeah

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.592
# Yeah...

01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:28.838
# I've got a feeling

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:34.136
- # I've got a feeling
- # Oh, yeah

01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.974
# I've got a feeling

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:41.647
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:39:51.194 --> 01:39:53.117
What a suitable ending, I think.

01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.285
(# THE BEATLES: "EIGHT DAYS A WEEK")

# Eight days a week

01:42:22.678 --> 01:42:24.476
# Eight days a week #

01:42:33.314 --> 01:42:36.158
JOHN: Hello, this is John speaking
with his voice.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:40.200
We're all very happy to be able to talk to
you like this on this little bit of plastic.

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:43.325
This record reaches you
at the end of a really gear year for us,

01:42:43.449 --> 01:42:44.917
and it's all due to you.

01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:48.789
When we made our first record
on Parlophone towards the end of 1962,

01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:51.462
we hoped everybody would like
what had already been our type of music

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:53.425
for several years already.

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:56.170
But we had no idea of all the gear things
in store for us

01:42:56.295 --> 01:42:59.174
It all happened really when Please
Please Me became a number one hit,

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:01.926
and after that, well,
'cor the blimeys, heave the mo'.

01:43:02.051 --> 01:43:03.303
Our biggest thrill of the year, well,

01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:05.429
I suppose it must have been topping the bill
at the London Palladium

01:43:05.554 --> 01:43:06.976
and then, only a couple of days later,

01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:09.317
being invited to take part
in the Royal Variety Show.

01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:11.106
This time last year,
we were all dead chuffed

01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:13.150
because Love Me Do
got into the Top Twenty,

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:17.275
and we can't believe, really, that so many
things have happened in between already.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.903
Just before I pass you over to Paul,

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:21.950
I'd like to say thank you
to all the Beatle people

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:23.539
who have written to me during the year,

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:25.954
and everyone who sent me
gifts and cards for my birthday,

01:43:26.075 --> 01:43:28.169
which I'm trying to forget, in October.

01:43:28.285 --> 01:43:31.380
I'd love to reply personally to everyone,
but I just haven't enough pens.

01:43:31.497 --> 01:43:33.750
- JOHN: In the meantime...
- PAUL: This is Paul here.

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.797
Everything that John said goes for me too,

01:43:35.918 --> 01:43:38.216
especially the bit about birthday cards
and the parcels,

01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:40.931
cos all our homes and offices
got stacks of mail last June...

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:42.265
Ow!

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:44.393
...when it was my birthday.

01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:48.981
Anyway, we're all dead pleased
by the way you've treated us in 1963,

01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:51.100
and we try to do everything we can
to please you

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:53.478
with the type of songs
we write and record next year.

01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:57.698
Oh, yeah, lots of people asked us
what we enjoy best, you see,

01:43:57.815 --> 01:43:59.533
concerts and television or recording?

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:01.243
We like doing stage shows
cos it's, you know,

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.488
it's great to hear an audience
enjoying themselves.

01:44:03.612 --> 01:44:05.910
But the thing we like best,
I think so, anyway,

01:44:06.031 --> 01:44:07.704
is going into the recording studio...

01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:10.544
- JOHN: Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!
- PAUL: ...to make new records,

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:12.038
which is what we've been doing all day

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:13.710
before we started on this special message.

01:44:13.831 --> 01:44:16.129
Well, what we like to hear most
is one of our songs, you know,

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:17.968
taking shape in a recording studio,

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.962
one of the ones that John and I
have written,

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:24.058
and then listening to the tapes afterwards
to hear how it all worked out, you see.

01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:25.927
- MAN: Ja, Ringo!
- RINGO: Hello, Ringo here.

01:44:26.051 --> 01:44:28.304
As you know, I was the last member
to join The Beatles.

01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:31.308
I started to play drums in the group 1962.

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:33.810
I've been in a couple of other groups...

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:38.940
PAUL: Oh, just wish the people a merry,
happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas.

01:44:39.064 --> 01:44:40.611
RINGO: Merry, happy New Year,

01:44:40.733 --> 01:44:43.111
and folks, happy Christmas, and may...

01:44:43.235 --> 01:44:44.862
may everything you wish be granted.

01:44:44.987 --> 01:44:47.035
PAUL: Sing, sing us Wenceslas,
King Wenceslas.

01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:48.157
RINGO: King Wenceslas.

01:44:48.282 --> 01:44:50.330
- PAUL: Well...!
- JOHN: Hurray, Paul!

01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:52.670
GEORGE: Thank you, Ringo!
Thank you, Ringo!

01:44:52.787 --> 01:44:54.380
We'll phone you!

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.624
I'm George Harrison.

01:44:56.749 --> 01:44:59.093
Nobody else has said anything yet
about our fan club secretaries,

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:01.633
Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose,

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:04.052
not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool.

01:45:04.173 --> 01:45:05.265
JOHN: Good old Freda!

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:06.929
GEORGE: So on behalf of us all,

01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:09.179
I'd just like to say a great, big thank you

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.806
to Ann, Bettina and Freda
for all the hard work they've done,

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:14.730
and we just hope you can go on
pleasing you for a long time,

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:18.445
cos it's gonna cause it to your reaction
to our records that really matters,

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.735
and I'd just like to say...

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:23.075
# Brightly was the schon at night

01:45:23.192 --> 01:45:25.115
# Though the winter cruel

01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:27.238
# When a pork pie came inside

01:45:27.363 --> 01:45:31.209
# Gathering winter cruel #

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:34.078
ALL: Merry Christmas, everybody!
