WEBVTT

00:08.667 --> 00:10.634
Are you sure
he hasn't sent anything?

00:10.669 --> 00:11.901
Mm-hmm.

00:11.936 --> 00:13.135
Flowers?

00:13.170 --> 00:14.299
Nope.

00:14.334 --> 00:16.100
Did you ask
out front?

00:16.135 --> 00:17.699
I asked.

00:17.734 --> 00:20.699
He hasn't called?

00:20.734 --> 00:22.165
It doesn't even
make any sense.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.634
Honey, he's a Murphy.
All the Murphys are like that.

00:24.669 --> 00:26.118
I knew his father growing up.

00:26.153 --> 00:27.676
Family's a bunch of mutts.

00:27.711 --> 00:29.200
How could he be such a jerk?

00:29.235 --> 00:30.300
You plant carrots...

00:33.467 --> 00:34.968
Honey, you, uh--
You want a ginger ale?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.333
Sure.

00:37.368 --> 00:38.467
Thanks.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.634
Another one.
Just delivered.

00:41.669 --> 00:42.766
Unbelievable.

00:42.801 --> 00:44.200
This is the fourth one
he's sent.

00:44.235 --> 00:45.618
They're getting
bigger.

00:45.653 --> 00:46.960
Psychiatric unit
again?

00:46.995 --> 00:48.232
Yeah.
No candy this time?

00:48.267 --> 00:50.267
Oh, we already sent it
down to the cancer kids.

00:50.302 --> 00:51.400
Thank you.

00:53.968 --> 00:54.933
Hey, Garrity.

00:54.968 --> 00:56.400
What are you
doing tonight, baby?

00:56.435 --> 00:58.232
Nothing.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.217
Damn. Why you
say it like that?

01:00.252 --> 01:02.132
I didn't say it
like anything.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.400
I said-- I said "nothing,"
like nothing.

01:04.435 --> 01:05.666
Right.

01:05.701 --> 01:07.934
I got a friend that can get us
into the Soho House.

01:07.969 --> 01:10.167
Thought we'd go down there
and check out the talent.

01:10.202 --> 01:11.534
Oh, wait.
You know what?

01:11.569 --> 01:12.867
I think
I got plans tonight.

01:12.902 --> 01:15.500
Yeah, I do.
Sorry, bro.

01:15.535 --> 01:16.933
What are you doing?

01:16.968 --> 01:18.034
I'm doing something, uh...

01:18.069 --> 01:19.365
with a friend.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.834
Hey, who put this
up here?

01:21.869 --> 01:23.084
What is it?

01:23.119 --> 01:24.576
It's a poem.

01:24.611 --> 01:25.999
- A poem?
- Yeah.

01:26.034 --> 01:28.334
Whose name's on it?

01:28.369 --> 01:30.634
It says "anonymous."

01:30.669 --> 01:32.033
Listen to this:

01:32.068 --> 01:34.068
"Down came the towers
For all the world to see

01:34.103 --> 01:37.033
"I didn't think God
Would ever spare me

01:37.068 --> 01:40.867
"There's little love in life,
For I have seen the grave

01:40.902 --> 01:43.767
Just give me the knife
So I can end it all today."

01:43.802 --> 01:44.901
Holy shit.

01:44.936 --> 01:45.866
Wow.

01:45.901 --> 01:47.065
Powerful.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.833
Yeah, powerfully bad.
It sucks.

01:48.868 --> 01:50.317
I don't know.
It's not that bad.

01:50.352 --> 01:51.732
- It rhymes.
- Well, so what?

01:51.779 --> 01:54.909
My 10-year-old can make stuff rhyme.
Doesn't mean he's the next, uh...

01:55.062 --> 01:57.625
- name a poet.
- Angie Dickinson.

01:58.068 --> 01:59.801
Angie Dickinson?
From Police Woman?

01:59.836 --> 02:00.832
Nah.

02:00.867 --> 02:02.167
I think you mean
Emily Dickinson.

02:02.202 --> 02:03.784
The Belle of Amherst.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.332
- Right.
- You know poetry?

02:05.367 --> 02:07.367
No. I jacked off
to a picture of her once,

02:07.402 --> 02:08.332
when I was 11.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.399
Hair was all tied back.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.233
She's kind of hot,
if you like that type.

02:11.268 --> 02:12.801
This needs to be wrapped, okay?

02:12.836 --> 02:15.334
Cover it with this. Okay?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.265
Do that outside.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.500
How horny is Franco,
by the way?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.065
So, Tommy,
you didn't like this?

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
I mean, I don't think
it's such a bad poem.

02:25.135 --> 02:26.566
You know,
it's short enough.

02:26.601 --> 02:29.734
Got some, you know,
some good imagery here--

02:29.769 --> 02:31.434
The grave and the knife.

02:31.469 --> 02:33.068
Oh, yeah, the knife.

02:33.103 --> 02:34.385
I know you wrote it.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.632
I didn't write this.

02:35.667 --> 02:36.966
- You wrote it...
- What the hell

02:37.001 --> 02:38.434
am I gonna be doing
writing poetry?

02:38.469 --> 02:41.167
- Aw, shit.
- You wrote it.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.734
How'd you find out?

02:42.769 --> 02:44.401
Heard a rumor.

02:44.436 --> 02:46.034
Anybody else know?

02:46.069 --> 02:47.084
Franco.

02:47.119 --> 02:48.100
Aw, shit.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.198
Yep.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.098
By the way,
in the future,

02:51.133 --> 02:53.165
if you have something
that you wrote

02:53.200 --> 02:55.400
that you want me to read,
just bring it to me.

02:55.435 --> 02:57.001
I'll sit down,
I'll read it,

02:57.036 --> 02:58.084
I'll digest it,

02:58.119 --> 02:59.098
and I'll give you

02:59.133 --> 03:00.400
the most honest
assessment I can.

03:00.435 --> 03:02.434
You'd do that?

03:02.469 --> 03:03.501
For you?

03:03.536 --> 03:04.501
Yeah.

03:04.536 --> 03:05.467
No.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.534 --> 03:42.601
Look at you, huh?
The life of the party.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.000
Let's get out
of here, baby.

03:47.035 --> 03:49.001
Okay, where are we
gonna go?

03:49.036 --> 03:50.968
I say we go back
to your place.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.165
Okay, but no candles,
all right?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.334
No new burns
until the old ones heal.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.132
Bitch.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.084
Did you touch
my boyfriend's ass?

04:05.119 --> 04:07.001
You got a problem
with that, whore?

04:07.036 --> 04:08.566
Who you calling
a whore?

04:08.601 --> 04:10.034
Well, you're the only
whore here,

04:10.069 --> 04:11.267
so it must be you,
bitch.

04:11.302 --> 04:12.499
Hey, hey.

04:12.534 --> 04:15.734
Guys, take it easy.
Jesus Christ.

04:15.769 --> 04:16.732
Get her off!

04:16.767 --> 04:17.732
Hey, hey, hey!

04:17.767 --> 04:18.933
Come on, come on,
come on!

04:18.968 --> 04:21.067
Hey, break it up!
Come on, let's go.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.200
That's enough.
Jesus.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.450
Break it up.

04:28.485 --> 04:29.666
Puta!

04:29.701 --> 04:30.666
Come on, bitch!

04:30.701 --> 04:33.200
- Bring it on!
- Okay! I'm okay!

04:38.767 --> 04:40.299
I didn't do nothing.

04:40.334 --> 04:43.034
Nez? Hey, Nez?
Nez? Can You hear me?

04:43.069 --> 04:44.265
Hey, Nez?

04:44.300 --> 04:45.933
Wake up, sweetie.

04:45.968 --> 04:47.233
Call 911 right now.
Right now!

04:47.268 --> 04:48.284
Everybody get back!

04:48.319 --> 04:49.265
Yo, get back.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.901
Come on, Nez. Wake up.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.629
ORPHANS

05:45.767 --> 05:47.100
And that was it.

05:47.135 --> 05:48.399
She was dead.

05:48.434 --> 05:50.332
I guess it was the coke.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.465
The emergency room doctor said

05:51.500 --> 05:53.467
that her heart just,
like, exploded.

05:53.502 --> 05:54.467
Fun night, huh?

05:54.502 --> 05:55.899
Well...

05:55.934 --> 05:59.634
No sex, but at least you didn't
have to drive her home.

05:59.669 --> 06:00.799
What, Franco?

06:00.834 --> 06:02.832
You are such an asshole.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.300
I already told you I was sorry.
Cut me a little slack.

06:05.335 --> 06:06.432
I'm still
in shock.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.100
You don't even care
that she's dead?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.734
No. I knew Nez
wouldn't make it past 35

06:09.769 --> 06:10.966
the first time I met her.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.165
What I care about is
you banging her behind my back.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.801
Hey, who says I was banging her?
We went out for a drink.

06:15.836 --> 06:17.551
Bullshit, Sean.
You were screwing her.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.267
Look, we went out
for a couple of drinks.

06:19.302 --> 06:20.399
We were just--

06:20.434 --> 06:22.034
All right, we fooled around
a little bit.

06:22.069 --> 06:23.434
But the woman is dead,
Franco, okay?

06:23.469 --> 06:25.101
Get your priorities straight.

06:25.136 --> 06:26.734
What about your
priorities, huh?

06:26.769 --> 06:27.801
You don't
do that, Sean.

06:27.836 --> 06:28.766
You don't bang

06:28.801 --> 06:29.884
a guy's girlfriend,

06:29.919 --> 06:31.026
ex-girlfriend, wife,

06:31.061 --> 06:32.197
ex-wife or his sister

06:32.241 --> 06:34.850
without his permission. And I mean
crystal-goddamn-clear permission.

06:34.901 --> 06:37.001
You haven't even spoken to her
in, like, five years.

06:37.036 --> 06:38.299
Guys?

06:38.334 --> 06:39.334
You broke the rules.

06:39.369 --> 06:40.299
Big time.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.801
Wh--? Ho-- How?
Explain to me--

06:42.836 --> 06:44.751
- Hup.
- Let me finish my--

06:44.786 --> 06:46.632
- Hup.
- Can I finish--

06:46.667 --> 06:49.200
Look, you can run into
a guy's ex-girlfriend at a bar

06:49.235 --> 06:50.198
- and feel her up.
- Yes.

06:50.255 --> 06:52.728
You can run into a guy's ex-wife
in a bar and...

06:52.788 --> 06:54.563
- Titty action.
- A bit of titty action, okay?

06:54.601 --> 06:56.801
You can even grab
a guy's sister's ass in a bar

06:56.836 --> 06:58.434
that the guy
actually happens to be in.

06:58.469 --> 06:59.899
Yes, you could.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.701
And it's all explainable
under the giant umbrella

07:01.736 --> 07:04.034
of the huge
sorry-I-was-drunk rule--

07:04.069 --> 07:05.198
Like Visa
and MasterCard,

07:05.233 --> 07:07.299
accepted the world over
and never argued.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.133
Never argued. Which was why
the rule was created,

07:09.168 --> 07:10.365
by the way, by the Romans.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.767
Ah, even earlier than that,
my friend-- The Druids.

07:12.810 --> 07:15.181
Listen, Franco didn't want
to have anything to do with her.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.299
He just doesn't get it.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.434
Look, girlfriend, ex-girlfriend,
wife, ex-wife,

07:18.469 --> 07:20.834
sister, half-sister,
no pussy.

07:20.869 --> 07:21.999
Next time,

07:22.034 --> 07:23.534
do the right thing.

07:27.901 --> 07:29.534
The right thing,
is that it, Frank?

07:29.569 --> 07:30.532
What about you, bro?

07:30.567 --> 07:32.034
What are you gonna do
about Keela?

07:32.069 --> 07:33.367
- Who?
- Nez's daughter.

07:33.402 --> 07:34.465
What about her?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.033
She left her
with Lazara, man.

07:36.068 --> 07:37.867
Is that where you want her to end up?

07:37.902 --> 07:39.033
It's not my problem.

07:39.068 --> 07:41.634
Frank... Nez told me
about the DNA test, okay?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.198
I know you're
Keela's father.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.567
I really don't see how that's
any of your business, Sean.

07:45.602 --> 07:46.732
What are you
gonna do, Frank?

07:46.767 --> 07:48.367
You talk about me
doing the right thing,

07:48.402 --> 07:49.832
but you're just
gonna walk away?

07:49.867 --> 07:52.068
Or does doing the right thing,
that doesn't apply to you?

07:52.103 --> 07:53.100
Looks that way, buddy.

07:53.135 --> 07:54.332
You know what?

07:54.367 --> 07:55.365
You don't give a shit

07:55.400 --> 07:56.801
about anybody
but yourself, Franc.

07:56.836 --> 07:58.033
You walk away
from this kid,

07:58.068 --> 07:59.467
that's some dark shit,
man, you know?

07:59.502 --> 08:00.532
Maybe you can
handle it.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.933
I just don't think
that I could.

08:01.968 --> 08:04.334
Mind your own goddamn
business, Sean!

08:04.369 --> 08:05.299
Easy.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.167
You don't
know me.

08:08.267 --> 08:10.267
Struck a nerve, huh,
Frankie?

08:10.302 --> 08:11.601
Hey, Franco.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.467
What's up with him?
Is he okay?

08:16.502 --> 08:17.434
Like I give
a shit.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.699
I leave for two days,

08:19.734 --> 08:21.500
and the whole joint
goes into the crapper.

08:23.068 --> 08:24.532
- Hey.
- Hey!

08:24.567 --> 08:25.801
What are you
doing here?

08:25.836 --> 08:26.866
What?

08:26.901 --> 08:28.198
You're suspended.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.432
It means
get your ass home.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.467
What, are you telling me
I can't even stop by?

08:31.502 --> 08:33.933
Somebody from division
stops by,

08:33.967 --> 08:35.634
and it's my butt
out on the flagpole.

08:35.669 --> 08:36.698
Get going.

08:36.734 --> 08:38.299
Let me get
a cup of coffee.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.232
Don't push me,
Jerry.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.299
I'll call division
myself.

08:42.335 --> 08:43.933
I mean it.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.832
Always looking to

08:45.867 --> 08:48.867
cover your own ass,
huh, Perolli?

08:48.902 --> 08:50.632
Shoo-fly.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.200
Tell the boys
I said hello.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.365
Hello.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.068
Hi. Is
Lazara here?

09:16.103 --> 09:17.734
She's sleeping.

09:17.769 --> 09:18.766
Oh yeah?

09:18.801 --> 09:20.317
You know, you're not
supposed to

09:20.352 --> 09:21.834
open the door
for strangers, right?

09:21.869 --> 09:23.132
Is my mommy
with you?

09:23.167 --> 09:25.834
Uh, nah, kiddo,
she's not.

09:25.869 --> 09:26.867
Lazara?

09:28.133 --> 09:29.933
Jesus.

09:29.968 --> 09:31.601
Lazara,
it's Franco.

09:31.636 --> 09:32.968
Are you here?

09:34.434 --> 09:35.601
Hello?

09:54.701 --> 09:58.434
She doesn't like it
when you wake her up.

09:58.469 --> 09:59.399
Uh, yeah, kid.

09:59.434 --> 10:00.500
Don't--
Don't look at that.

10:02.968 --> 10:05.566
Here, back out.

10:05.601 --> 10:07.832
Um, come here,
sweetheart.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.367
I got to tell you
something, okay?

10:09.402 --> 10:10.534
What?

10:10.569 --> 10:11.632
Oh...

10:11.667 --> 10:14.067
Well, um...

10:14.102 --> 10:16.467
Listen.

10:18.801 --> 10:19.766
Your mother.

10:19.801 --> 10:23.267
Um... you know,
she was no good,

10:23.302 --> 10:24.999
and, um,

10:25.034 --> 10:28.133
well, you know,
she had a lot of problems.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.566
So, you know, in some ways,

10:29.601 --> 10:31.867
maybe it's better
that she, um...

10:33.400 --> 10:36.634
I mean, you know, it was
gonna happen sooner or later.

10:39.801 --> 10:40.801
She's dead.

10:44.734 --> 10:45.966
That's the thing.

10:46.001 --> 10:48.901
So, um, you know,
you take a couple of minutes,

10:48.936 --> 10:51.601
you know, cry,
do whatever you gotta do.

10:51.636 --> 10:53.799
And then we'll...

10:53.834 --> 10:56.001
We'll get the hell
out of here, okay?

10:58.901 --> 11:00.484
Right.

11:00.519 --> 11:02.068
Come on.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.150
I'm going up to my room.

11:08.185 --> 11:09.367
All right, sweetheart.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.766
Okay.

11:10.801 --> 11:13.701
And get plenty of rest.
You heard what the doctor said.

11:13.736 --> 11:14.766
Okay, Daddy.

11:14.801 --> 11:17.550
Thanks for...
Well, thanks.

11:17.585 --> 11:20.300
You're welcome,
sweetheart.

11:21.601 --> 11:22.799
Hey.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.734
Are you hungry?
Can I get you anything?

11:24.769 --> 11:25.766
Um, no.

11:25.801 --> 11:27.167
Maybe just some bread
with butter

11:27.202 --> 11:28.368
and some
orange juice.

11:28.403 --> 11:29.468
Okay,
coming right up.

11:29.503 --> 11:30.534
Janie,
how are the kids?

11:30.569 --> 11:31.499
Did they behave?

11:31.534 --> 11:32.934
Well, Connor put
a booger on Katy.

11:32.969 --> 11:34.966
But other
than that...

11:35.001 --> 11:36.467
Right. Would you
take care of her?

11:36.502 --> 11:38.400
- Yeah. How much is it?
- 25.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.337
For two hours?

11:39.369 --> 11:41.126
Jeez, there're families
in third world countries

11:41.168 --> 11:43.001
that don't make
that much in a month.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.834
Yeah, well,
thank God I live here.

11:44.869 --> 11:46.201
- Yeah.
- Bye.

11:46.236 --> 11:47.499
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:47.534 --> 11:48.934
Hey, say hi to
your mom, okay?

11:48.969 --> 11:50.667
Okay.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.499
That's it.

11:53.534 --> 11:54.968
She's not watching
my kids anymore.

11:55.003 --> 11:56.751
But she's a sweetheart.

11:56.786 --> 11:58.465
She's too... sarcastic.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.133
- And that's unusual in this house?
- Ha, ha.

12:01.168 --> 12:03.467
Look, I-- we've had
a rough couple of weeks.

12:03.502 --> 12:05.767
I don't want to come down
too hard on you,

12:05.802 --> 12:06.999
but I really--
Seriously,

12:07.034 --> 12:09.400
you gotta start spending
less time on your love life

12:09.435 --> 12:12.267
and more time
watching the kids.

12:12.302 --> 12:14.867
You know what
I mean?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.332
I'm serious.

12:16.367 --> 12:17.332
Did you
even know

12:17.367 --> 12:18.584
she was going
into the city

12:18.619 --> 12:19.766
with the Murphy kid
that night,

12:19.801 --> 12:22.567
let alone joyriding
around Manhattan with him?

12:22.602 --> 12:25.334
And I'll bet my left nut
that that kid's on drugs.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.334
Did you hear
what I said?

12:27.369 --> 12:29.332
I said my left nut,

12:29.367 --> 12:30.968
which just happens to be
my favorite nut.

12:31.003 --> 12:32.934
We're putting
the clamps down

12:32.969 --> 12:34.165
on Colleen.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.600
She's not going
anywhere anymore.

12:37.635 --> 12:41.001
So you're just gonna
ignore me, huh?

12:41.036 --> 12:42.165
Fine.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.068
That's fine.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.432
Okay.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.867
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

12:47.902 --> 12:49.299
I'm gonna sit down.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.017
I'm gonna come up
with a whole, you know,

12:51.052 --> 12:52.701
detailed schedule
about when it's okay

12:52.736 --> 12:54.133
for you to go out
with Roger

12:54.168 --> 12:55.232
and when
it's not okay

12:55.267 --> 12:57.068
for you to go out
with Roger, all right?

12:57.103 --> 12:58.033
And when it's okay

12:58.068 --> 12:59.284
to have the wiseass
baby-sitter

12:59.319 --> 13:00.500
instead of me
watch the kids.

13:00.535 --> 13:01.934
Where you going?

13:01.969 --> 13:03.365
Janet.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.799
I'm serious.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.567
Did you hear what I said?

13:25.634 --> 13:28.001
I'm on the job
22 years.

13:28.036 --> 13:29.832
No great shakes.

13:29.867 --> 13:32.300
Survived a couple
of building collapses.

13:32.335 --> 13:34.399
Been burnt like
a piece of bacon.

13:34.434 --> 13:37.801
One gay shithead
takes a swing at me...

13:37.836 --> 13:39.566
and I got to
turn my badge in.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.434
If you'd have accepted
the punishment

13:41.469 --> 13:42.518
from the commissioner--

13:42.553 --> 13:43.567
That wasn't gonna happen.

13:43.602 --> 13:44.566
So here we are.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.017
Now your hearing's
in a week.

13:46.052 --> 13:47.399
That should give us
enough time

13:47.434 --> 13:49.834
to find the bartender
who witnessed the incident.

13:49.869 --> 13:51.467
And what happens
if we can't find him?

13:51.502 --> 13:53.233
Well, that would
be a problem.

13:53.268 --> 13:55.332
What you really need

13:55.367 --> 13:56.850
is a gay friend
or coworker

13:56.885 --> 13:58.299
to testify
on your defense.

13:58.334 --> 14:01.068
Someone who'll say
you're not a crazed homophobe.

14:02.267 --> 14:03.265
A what?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.934
A person who hates
gay people.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.467
Do you have
any gay friends?

14:09.502 --> 14:11.068
I don't know any fags.

14:11.103 --> 14:12.599
End of discussion.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.332
You know, Chief Reilly,

14:15.367 --> 14:19.500
as a gay man, I find
the word "fag" offensive.

14:19.535 --> 14:22.367
Oh, Christ.

14:26.068 --> 14:27.934
Hey, do you
have a second?

14:27.969 --> 14:29.432
No.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.467
This is important.

14:31.502 --> 14:33.367
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.034
Hey. How's it going?

14:47.567 --> 14:51.867
Sorry I let myself in,
but this is important.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.098
Look, the, uh--
The reason I'm here is,

15:01.133 --> 15:04.400
well, I'd like you to respect
what Janet and I have.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.465
She's moved on...

15:06.500 --> 15:08.801
and I think you should
do the same.

15:13.367 --> 15:16.084
Look, I don't know
what your plan is,

15:16.119 --> 15:18.766
if you're trying to come
between us.

15:18.801 --> 15:20.601
You had her send me away
from the hospital

15:20.636 --> 15:21.666
the other night,

15:21.701 --> 15:23.068
which I really
didn't appreciate.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.132
Look...

15:29.167 --> 15:31.432
just back off a little.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.434
Let us live our lives, okay?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.367
Okay?

15:41.767 --> 15:43.734
Oh, and just
for the record,

15:43.769 --> 15:44.732
I know it was you.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.234
The virus
in my computers,

15:47.269 --> 15:49.085
canceling
my credit cards.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.843
I know you're not smart enough

15:50.878 --> 15:52.567
to do all that stuff
by yourself.

15:52.602 --> 15:53.917
Who'd you have
help you?

15:53.952 --> 15:55.198
How'd you
pull it off?

15:55.233 --> 15:56.701
What, you're not gonna
talk to me?

15:56.736 --> 15:57.766
That's really mature.

15:57.801 --> 16:00.767
I think you owe me
some reimbursements too.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.065
God.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.901
Go ahead. Take a swing.

16:08.936 --> 16:10.165
Come on.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.400
What's your problem?

16:13.467 --> 16:15.033
What is
your pro--

16:15.068 --> 16:17.367
Let me tell you
something, okay?

16:17.402 --> 16:19.667
She might be
sucking your dick

16:19.702 --> 16:20.699
for the time being,

16:20.734 --> 16:22.367
but her ass
belongs to me.

16:22.402 --> 16:23.267
You got that?

16:24.934 --> 16:26.467
Get up!

16:26.502 --> 16:28.001
Get up.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.399
Jesus, man,

16:34.434 --> 16:36.001
what the hell are you doing?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.299
What are you, insane?

16:37.334 --> 16:39.100
Who's smart now,
asshole?

16:39.135 --> 16:40.567
Huh?

16:41.734 --> 16:42.601
Dad?

16:44.434 --> 16:46.133
What are you,
crazy?

16:49.534 --> 16:51.801
I think I left my Gameboy...

16:51.836 --> 16:52.968
here.

16:58.634 --> 17:00.532
Okay.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.165
So here's
the thing.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.250
You don't understand
right now

17:04.285 --> 17:06.692
'cause you're just
a little boy.

17:06.727 --> 17:09.480
But when you grow up
to be a man,

17:09.515 --> 17:12.233
you're gonna realize
certain things.

17:12.268 --> 17:13.999
All right?

17:14.034 --> 17:17.317
One of those things
is that sometimes

17:17.352 --> 17:20.566
you, uh, have to
fight other men.

17:20.601 --> 17:24.367
Especially when you're
defending yourself.

17:24.402 --> 17:28.133
When somebody else
throws the first punch.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.734
And that's what
Roger did today.

17:29.769 --> 17:31.065
He threw the first punch.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.300
So you can't
tell your mother

17:33.335 --> 17:34.299
about any of
this stuff

17:34.334 --> 17:36.867
that you saw
here today, okay?

17:36.902 --> 17:38.033
Because otherwise,

17:38.068 --> 17:41.867
she's gonna get very,
very mad at Roger.

17:41.902 --> 17:44.284
Won't she get mad at you too?

17:44.319 --> 17:46.632
Well, if she gets
mad at me,

17:46.667 --> 17:49.767
just imagine how mad
she's gonna be at you

17:49.802 --> 17:52.367
for eating ice cream
for breakfast.

18:04.534 --> 18:05.666
Eat up.

18:05.701 --> 18:06.799
What's this?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.200
Those are eggs,
sweetheart.

18:08.235 --> 18:09.567
How come
they're not yellow?

18:09.602 --> 18:11.068
Oh, they're
egg whites.

18:11.103 --> 18:12.534
They're better for you.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.666
What's this?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.299
That's a protein shake.

18:15.334 --> 18:16.934
Help you grow up
big and strong.

18:19.534 --> 18:21.233
Are you gonna be
my daddy?

18:23.367 --> 18:24.832
Eat your eggs.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.734
We won't have to have eggs
every day, right, daddy?

18:27.769 --> 18:30.767
Well, what would you like
for breakfast?

18:30.802 --> 18:31.866
Candy-Os.

18:31.901 --> 18:33.400
Nah, that shit's
all sugar.

18:33.435 --> 18:35.218
You said a bad word!

18:35.253 --> 18:36.910
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.

18:36.945 --> 18:38.532
Uh, I don't know.

18:38.567 --> 18:41.100
You can have Candy-Os
maybe once a week, okay?

18:41.135 --> 18:42.566
Okay, Daddy.

18:42.601 --> 18:45.400
Oh, yeah, we're gonna have to
move to a new apartment too.

18:45.435 --> 18:47.532
What?

18:47.567 --> 18:49.534
I want my own room,
a princess bed,

18:49.569 --> 18:51.534
and lots of toys
and a TV.

18:51.569 --> 18:52.499
Oh.

18:52.534 --> 18:53.699
Anything else?

18:53.734 --> 18:55.566
I want to go to the zoo.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.567
Well, that we can definitely do.
I love the zoo.

18:58.602 --> 19:01.251
Could we go to the zoo today?

19:01.286 --> 19:03.866
Um... I don't know,
sweetheart.

19:03.901 --> 19:06.068
We'll see. Maybe if you
eat your eggs.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.767
What time could we
go to the zoo?

19:09.802 --> 19:11.601
Jesus, I don't know.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.065
Eat your eggs.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.300
I hate them!
They're not the right color!

19:17.500 --> 19:19.365
Hey, Keela!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.834
Keela, get back here
and clean this mess up.

19:23.001 --> 19:24.034
Yeah.

19:24.069 --> 19:25.033
Bad news.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.767
Jennifer Aniston's
a dyke.

19:26.802 --> 19:28.500
No. Dad's missing.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.799
What?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.934
He got into a fight
with Ma on Monday.

19:31.969 --> 19:32.985
About what?

19:33.020 --> 19:33.966
I don't know.

19:34.001 --> 19:35.434
Over some new dishes
that she bought.

19:35.469 --> 19:36.866
- New dishes?
- Yeah.

19:36.901 --> 19:38.901
He said he was going over
to Uncle Teddy's house.

19:38.936 --> 19:39.934
He never came back.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.399
Listen, Tommy,

19:41.434 --> 19:43.117
you're gonna have to
go over to Ted's

19:43.152 --> 19:44.801
and find out what
the real story is.

19:44.836 --> 19:45.999
Why me?

19:46.034 --> 19:47.834
Because Ma says
you're the only person

19:47.869 --> 19:49.667
Dad really opens up to.

19:49.702 --> 19:51.098
Oh, yeah, right.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.934
People are always
confusing me and Oprah.

19:52.969 --> 19:54.601
Yeah. I'll see you.

19:54.636 --> 19:55.968
Bye.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.701
I'm making pork chops
for dinner.

19:59.736 --> 20:00.867
You want pork chops?

20:00.902 --> 20:02.732
Mm.

20:02.767 --> 20:03.732
Don't grunt.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.400
Talk to me
like a human being.

20:06.435 --> 20:07.666
If I make
pork chops,

20:07.701 --> 20:10.233
you'll want applesauce,
which is fine.

20:10.268 --> 20:11.432
I like making
applesauce.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.584
Makes the house
smell so nice.

20:13.619 --> 20:15.701
And apples
are good for you.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.165
Fights
the cancer.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.100
Or maybe
that's tomatoes.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.434
Yeah, I'm gonna
have to

20:21.469 --> 20:23.699
go back
to the store.

20:23.734 --> 20:26.167
Maybe I shouldn't make
the applesauce.

20:26.202 --> 20:27.632
Maybe I'll just
buy a jar.

20:27.667 --> 20:31.068
Or maybe I'll
make it from scratch.

20:31.103 --> 20:33.500
Or the jar.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.566
Yeah?

20:40.601 --> 20:42.601
Y-yeah, P-Peter.

20:42.636 --> 20:44.701
It's your dad.

20:44.736 --> 20:46.732
Is Mom okay?

20:46.767 --> 20:48.265
Yeah, yeah,
she's fine.

20:48.300 --> 20:52.001
I got to ask you to help me
with something.

20:52.036 --> 20:53.368
I fill this out, and then what?

20:53.403 --> 20:54.885
They're gonna
place her somewhere?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.367
How long does that
typically take?

20:56.402 --> 20:57.632
'Cause, I mean,

20:57.667 --> 20:59.934
she's a little bit too much
for me to handle.

21:01.901 --> 21:03.132
You know what
I mean?

21:03.167 --> 21:06.400
I can't take care
of her, so...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.701
It's Baker 170. We just
showed up on scene.

21:21.634 --> 21:23.699
What do we got?

21:23.734 --> 21:26.701
Bathtub crashed
through a ceiling.

21:26.736 --> 21:27.799
Neighbors said

21:27.834 --> 21:29.634
a kid might have been
left alone in 6-B.

21:29.669 --> 21:30.732
We got it.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.766
Bathtub situation.

21:32.801 --> 21:34.400
Hey, how's it going
with Keela?

21:34.435 --> 21:35.518
Is that working out?

21:35.553 --> 21:36.566
I wouldn't know.

21:36.601 --> 21:38.384
I dropped her off
at family services.

21:38.419 --> 21:40.026
What is that, like,
a day care thing?

21:40.061 --> 21:41.634
Nah, it's, like,
an adoption thing.

21:41.669 --> 21:43.168
Asshole.

21:43.203 --> 21:44.632
I'm sorry.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.666
Did you want her?

21:46.701 --> 21:48.184
I knew you'd bail on her, man.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.632
I knew you
couldn't do it.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.534
Yeah, I knew I
couldn't do it either.

21:51.569 --> 21:52.699
I know
who I am, Sean.

21:52.734 --> 21:54.134
I can barely
take care of myself.

21:54.183 --> 21:56.191
How am I supposed to take care
of a 5-year-old girl?

21:56.230 --> 21:57.138
You didn't even try.

21:57.168 --> 21:58.568
You know what?
I'm not discussing it.

21:58.603 --> 21:59.985
Orphanages could
ruin a kid for life.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.687
She's not going to a goddamn orphanage.
They're gonna find her a family.

22:02.726 --> 22:04.726
- A mother or father, maybe--
- You are such a coward.

22:04.769 --> 22:05.699
What was that?

22:05.734 --> 22:06.867
You want me to repeat it?

22:06.902 --> 22:08.001
- Yeah, please do.
- Hey!

22:08.036 --> 22:09.068
Hey. Drop it.

22:09.103 --> 22:10.434
Now!

22:13.133 --> 22:14.417
It's all about you, huh, Franco?

22:14.452 --> 22:15.666
Yeah, looks that way.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.933
Let me ask you something.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.365
Did you walk her
into the place,

22:18.400 --> 22:20.801
or did you just slow down
the car and push her out?

22:20.836 --> 22:22.065
Selfish prick.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.001
You don't know when
to shut up, do you?

22:24.036 --> 22:24.966
Hey!

22:25.001 --> 22:26.132
Hey, hey, hey.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.701
Knock it off.
We got a grab to make here.

22:28.736 --> 22:30.968
- Pick up your helmet.
- Jerk-offs.

22:31.003 --> 22:32.232
Prick.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.500
Take him with you.
We'll head upstairs.

22:35.334 --> 22:36.200
Go.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.065
Hey, for what
it's worth,

22:40.100 --> 22:41.901
a lot of adopted kids
turn out all right.

22:41.936 --> 22:43.618
Yeah, tell me
about it.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.343
Yeah. I mean,
you know...

22:45.378 --> 22:47.034
look at Courtney Love.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.968
Holy shit.

22:56.068 --> 22:57.701
Perolli said
people heard crying.

22:57.736 --> 22:59.734
Don't hear
nothing now.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.601
Yeah.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.084
Shh. Wait, wait.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.399
You hear something?

23:07.468 --> 23:09.084
No, I don't
hear anything.

23:11.001 --> 23:12.784
I hear something, man.

23:12.819 --> 23:14.567
Nah, it's
the water.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.632
I got one.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.534
- You got something?
- Yeah.

23:17.569 --> 23:18.532
Alive?

23:18.567 --> 23:19.701
I don't know yet.
Hang on.

23:24.934 --> 23:26.500
Yeah, yeah,
she's alive, Franco.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.799
All right.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.334
Get a board up here, quick.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.332
Hi.

23:32.367 --> 23:33.465
Hi.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.500
How are you doing?

23:34.535 --> 23:35.984
It hurts.

23:36.019 --> 23:37.399
Yeah?

23:37.434 --> 23:39.184
Am I gonna die?

23:39.219 --> 23:40.899
No, no, no.

23:40.934 --> 23:42.299
We're gonna take you
out of here,

23:42.334 --> 23:44.068
and then the doctor's
gonna fix you up,

23:44.103 --> 23:45.434
And you'll be good as new.

23:45.469 --> 23:46.768
Okay?

23:46.803 --> 23:48.033
Okay.

23:48.068 --> 23:49.334
What's your name?

23:49.369 --> 23:50.866
Maura.

23:50.901 --> 23:52.867
What's your favorite ice cream?

23:52.902 --> 23:54.632
Moose tracks.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.034
Moose tracks.
That's the one with the, uh...

23:58.069 --> 23:59.867
it's like chocolate chunks
and--

24:00.901 --> 24:02.667
Is there marshmallows
in it?

24:04.500 --> 24:06.365
Hey, guys.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.050
We got you, Tommy.

24:08.085 --> 24:09.666
She's all right, guys.

24:09.701 --> 24:11.065
Give us a minute,
all right?

24:11.100 --> 24:13.500
- Give us a minute,
- Tommy, we're just about there.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.968
You like Snickers bars?

24:15.003 --> 24:17.068
I like Chunkies.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.992
Chunkies? I didn't even know
they made Chunkies anymore.

24:20.036 --> 24:22.052
Didn't they stop
making 'em?

24:22.087 --> 24:24.068
They did, but they came back.

24:24.115 --> 24:26.601
Oh, they did? Well,
we're gonna have to get ourselves

24:26.667 --> 24:28.867
a nice Chunky bar too
when you get out of here.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.435
Okay?

24:30.470 --> 24:31.933
Okay.

24:31.968 --> 24:33.400
- Inside.
- On three.

24:33.435 --> 24:34.599
Okay, Maura.

24:34.634 --> 24:36.867
Now when they lift
that couch up,

24:36.902 --> 24:39.100
I'm gonna pull you
towards me, okay?

24:39.135 --> 24:42.033
Okay.

24:42.068 --> 24:43.300
Two, three.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.267
Here we come.

24:47.302 --> 24:49.432
Okay, sweetheart.

24:49.467 --> 24:50.667
She's out.
She's out.

24:50.702 --> 24:51.866
- She's out?
- Yeah.

24:51.901 --> 24:53.601
Easy, easy, easy.

24:55.133 --> 24:57.068
Okay. Here we go.

24:57.103 --> 24:58.485
All right?

24:58.520 --> 24:59.943
Here we go.

24:59.978 --> 25:01.332
You got her?

25:01.367 --> 25:03.767
Yeah. Okay,
I got her head.

25:03.802 --> 25:06.167
Here you go, Maura. Okay?

25:06.202 --> 25:08.135
Doctor's here.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.068
All right?

25:13.068 --> 25:14.601
She's dead.

25:14.636 --> 25:16.232
What?

25:16.267 --> 25:17.767
Her neck is broken.
She died instantly.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.100
No.

25:21.135 --> 25:22.666
Maura?

25:22.701 --> 25:25.068
Sweetheart?

25:25.103 --> 25:26.701
No.

25:26.736 --> 25:28.265
Maura?

25:28.300 --> 25:30.267
Maura,
sweetheart?

25:30.302 --> 25:31.767
Maura?

25:47.901 --> 25:49.432
What the hell
was that?

25:49.467 --> 25:50.767
Yeah, it's always tough
with kids.

25:50.802 --> 25:51.732
No, forget the kid.

25:51.767 --> 25:52.966
I'm talking
about Tommy.

25:53.001 --> 25:54.801
Jesus, he was talking
to her the whole time?

25:54.836 --> 25:56.601
Maybe he was trying
to revive her or something.

25:56.636 --> 25:59.265
I hear him
mention Chunkies?

25:59.300 --> 26:02.601
Yeah, I got to admit,
I heard that too.

26:04.467 --> 26:05.866
Look, man, Tommy's the man,
all right?

26:05.901 --> 26:08.133
I don't like to see cracks
showing in that foundation.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.098
Yeah, well,
you never know.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.434
No kidding. You don't
look so good yourself.

26:12.469 --> 26:13.532
Thanks.

26:13.567 --> 26:14.567
Hey, uh, Lou.

26:14.617 --> 26:16.585
Do you know if Courtney Love
was adopted?

26:16.634 --> 26:18.017
No, but it would
certainly explain

26:18.052 --> 26:19.365
her last appearance
on Letterman.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.198
I'm telling you,
she was talking to me

26:21.233 --> 26:23.068
for, like, I don't know,
a couple of minutes.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.098
I mean, she even--

26:24.133 --> 26:25.567
She told me her
favorite ice cream.

26:25.602 --> 26:27.351
Her neck
was crushed, Gavin.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.100
Take the rest
of the tour off.

26:29.135 --> 26:30.901
I'm telling you,
chief.

26:30.936 --> 26:32.432
I'm all right.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.901
You're talking to
dead little girls.

26:34.936 --> 26:36.832
If that counts
as okay,

26:36.867 --> 26:38.801
they changed
the meaning of the word.

26:38.836 --> 26:40.068
You're done.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.265
Here's
the 2-1 delivery.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.001
He smacks it
into right field.

27:13.701 --> 27:16.200
He's 3-for-3.
He's got a hot bat today.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.483
I just want
to say thanks for Colleen,

27:37.518 --> 27:40.767
and, uh... I got
one more favor to ask.

27:40.802 --> 27:42.001
Okay?

27:43.901 --> 27:45.767
Thanks.

28:03.534 --> 28:04.599
Hello?

28:04.634 --> 28:05.866
Hi, Daddy. It's me.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.265
Hey, baby,
what's going on?

28:07.300 --> 28:09.167
You'll never guess
who showed up here

28:09.202 --> 28:10.167
this afternoon,

28:10.202 --> 28:11.165
finally.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.850
Let me guess.
The Murphy kid?

28:12.885 --> 28:14.465
You know
what he told me?

28:14.500 --> 28:15.933
He said he sent
all these flowers

28:15.968 --> 28:17.767
and notes and candy
and a Vermont teddy bear

28:17.802 --> 28:19.167
to the hospital
while I was there.

28:19.202 --> 28:20.132
Well, I--

28:20.167 --> 28:21.667
I-- I mean, come on.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.365
You can--

28:23.400 --> 28:26.034
if they sent teddy bears,
we would've seen teddy bears.

28:26.069 --> 28:27.767
Can you believe
what a jerk he is?

28:27.802 --> 28:29.432
What did I tell you?

28:29.467 --> 28:31.400
God, you were
so right.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.118
He's a complete liar.

28:33.153 --> 28:34.766
Remember what you said

28:34.801 --> 28:38.100
about that tool you can use
to get rid of a tattoo?

28:38.135 --> 28:40.599
Yes.

28:40.634 --> 28:42.365
Is there really such a thing?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.467
Honey, I'm sure
I can find something.

28:44.502 --> 28:46.901
Don't worry
about it. Okay?

28:46.936 --> 28:48.098
I love you.

28:48.133 --> 28:49.200
I love you too.

28:49.235 --> 28:50.734
Bye.

29:14.602 --> 29:15.933
Hey!

29:15.968 --> 29:17.966
Uncle Teddy!

29:24.135 --> 29:25.532
Boyyy!

29:28.934 --> 29:31.999
Hey, Tommy...
what are you doing?

29:32.034 --> 29:34.034
I was on the porch for,
like, half an hour,

29:34.069 --> 29:35.034
knocking on
the window.

29:35.069 --> 29:36.101
Where's my old man?

29:36.136 --> 29:37.098
Nice to see you too.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.667
Oh, sorry. How you doing, Uncle Ted?

29:38.702 --> 29:39.999
Never better.

29:40.034 --> 29:41.534
What's with
the tiny bottle?

29:41.569 --> 29:42.866
Mm.

29:42.901 --> 29:44.867
Try one. Makes you feel
like a giant.

29:46.068 --> 29:48.133
Where's, uh,
Auntie Peg?

29:48.168 --> 29:49.684
- Dead.
- She died?

29:49.719 --> 29:51.165
She's dead to me.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.666
Moved out
three months ago.

29:52.701 --> 29:54.133
We had an argument
over a rug.

29:54.168 --> 29:55.700
Next thing
you know, bam!

29:55.735 --> 29:57.233
I'm living
a whole new life.

29:57.268 --> 29:58.901
- A rug?
- What?

30:03.069 --> 30:04.051
Look.

30:04.086 --> 30:04.999
What?

30:05.034 --> 30:06.599
You don't like
my moves?

30:06.634 --> 30:08.233
Okay, I'm just here
to see my dad.

30:08.268 --> 30:09.501
Is he here or not?

30:09.536 --> 30:10.699
Teddy.

30:10.734 --> 30:13.701
We're almost
out of champagne, Ted.

30:13.736 --> 30:15.068
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

30:15.103 --> 30:16.499
Mm!

30:16.534 --> 30:18.133
Hey, hey!

30:19.767 --> 30:21.599
- Dad?
- That's one of my kids.

30:21.634 --> 30:23.467
That's Tommy.
He's a fireman, you know.

30:23.502 --> 30:24.966
Hey, Tom,

30:25.001 --> 30:26.901
grab a babe,
but not this one,

30:26.936 --> 30:28.500
and-- And join
the party.

30:30.133 --> 30:31.265
Uh, son,

30:31.300 --> 30:33.100
say hello to,
uh, um...

30:33.135 --> 30:34.901
I forgot
your name again.

30:34.936 --> 30:35.966
- Sara.
- Sara.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.365
Say hello to Sara.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.901
Okay, I need to see you and you
in the other room right now.

30:41.936 --> 30:43.065
- Aww.
- Aww.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.367
I think we're in trouble.

30:45.968 --> 30:47.465
No shit, Sherlock.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.583
What the hell's
going on?

30:48.618 --> 30:49.667
What are you guys
doing?

30:49.702 --> 30:50.818
What is this?

30:50.853 --> 30:51.899
What's this?

30:51.922 --> 30:53.839
Why is there a mini-refrigerator
in the living room?

30:53.897 --> 30:54.866
For shooters!

30:54.901 --> 30:56.367
What's your pleasure?

30:56.402 --> 30:57.834
Right now,
nothing.

30:59.167 --> 31:01.434
Okay... the two women
in the other room--

31:01.469 --> 31:02.500
Are they
hookers?

31:02.535 --> 31:04.151
- Yes.
- No.

31:04.186 --> 31:05.732
- No.
- Yes.

31:05.767 --> 31:08.450
Well... mine's bought
and paid for,

31:08.485 --> 31:11.133
but his just took
a liking to him.

31:12.334 --> 31:13.566
It's true.

31:13.601 --> 31:15.034
Very funny.
What's with the pills?

31:15.069 --> 31:17.167
They're gold, kid.
Pure gold.

31:17.202 --> 31:18.751
They are pretty good.

31:18.786 --> 31:20.193
Really
pretty good.

31:20.228 --> 31:21.566
This blue one--
Viagra.

31:21.601 --> 31:24.267
Works great
for the quick fix.

31:24.302 --> 31:25.499
This one--

31:25.534 --> 31:28.400
This is the one Mike Ditka
talks about on the TV.

31:28.435 --> 31:29.632
Lasts a long time

31:29.667 --> 31:32.233
and makes your cock,
I don't know... thicker!

31:32.268 --> 31:33.599
This is insane.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.165
This is really insane.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.400
I like
the Mike Ditka one.

31:36.435 --> 31:37.365
You know, of course,

31:37.400 --> 31:38.766
I was always
a Bear fan too.

31:38.801 --> 31:41.701
I-- I--
That's the one I like too.

31:41.736 --> 31:43.033
Dad, Dad.
Wait.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.601
You're taking
this stuff?

31:44.636 --> 31:45.766
Hell, yes.

31:45.801 --> 31:47.601
Son, I'm telling you,
it is great stuff.

31:47.636 --> 31:48.966
Here, take some.

31:49.001 --> 31:50.165
Uncle Teddy,
I need to talk

31:50.200 --> 31:51.617
to my father
alone for a minute.

31:51.652 --> 31:53.034
Hey, this is my house,
punk!

31:53.069 --> 31:54.784
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

31:54.819 --> 31:56.500
Teddy. Teddy. It's okay.

32:02.601 --> 32:04.367
For the ladies.

32:12.068 --> 32:13.299
You want a shooter?

32:13.334 --> 32:16.532
No, I do not want a shooter.

32:16.567 --> 32:20.134
Tom, we only have the girls
for another two hours,

32:20.169 --> 32:23.701
so maybe you could
come back after that, okay?

32:23.736 --> 32:26.033
Dad, what are
you guys doing?

32:26.068 --> 32:28.734
Oh. Are you gonna judge me?
Is that it?

32:28.769 --> 32:30.151
Aw, n-- I am not
judging you.

32:30.186 --> 32:31.499
I am just
trying to figure out--

32:31.534 --> 32:35.233
Your mother drove me nuts
for 47 goddamn years.

32:35.268 --> 32:36.534
Judge that!

32:41.968 --> 32:43.500
Ah...

32:46.400 --> 32:48.267
You know...

32:50.200 --> 32:53.400
We had six kids together.

32:56.968 --> 32:58.801
You know how many times
we had sex

32:58.836 --> 33:00.634
in all the years
we've been together?

33:01.667 --> 33:03.434
Six times
to procreate.

33:03.469 --> 33:06.434
The other three...

33:06.469 --> 33:09.400
Now one was in 1966.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.732
Christmastime.

33:11.767 --> 33:14.968
That was my big gift
for the year.

33:16.267 --> 33:18.334
The other two times...

33:18.369 --> 33:19.399
Ah.

33:19.434 --> 33:21.566
Never mind.

33:21.601 --> 33:24.866
You know,
me and your uncle,

33:24.901 --> 33:28.434
we fought fires...
all our lives.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.133
We busted our balls
up in the Bronx

33:32.168 --> 33:35.065
back in the day.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.634
We got out of it,
you know, free and clear.

33:40.133 --> 33:41.816
And you know what, Tom?

33:41.851 --> 33:43.500
After all of that...

33:43.535 --> 33:45.732
I deserve to...

33:45.767 --> 33:48.634
spend the rest of my time
on this planet

33:48.669 --> 33:50.299
banging my brains out

33:50.334 --> 33:53.667
and listening
to Tony Bennett sing,

33:53.702 --> 33:56.001
live and in person.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.818
Can't you see,
Tommy?

33:58.853 --> 34:01.601
I'm happy... finally.

34:09.833 --> 34:13.199
Well... how are you gonna
explain all this to Ma?

34:13.235 --> 34:14.734
Well...

34:16.100 --> 34:18.367
I was hoping
you could handle that.

34:18.402 --> 34:20.264
She always said

34:20.300 --> 34:23.766
you were the only one
in the family

34:23.802 --> 34:25.701
she could really
open up to.

34:34.132 --> 34:35.364
Hey.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.364
Tom, it's late.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.400
Yeah, I know,
I know.

34:37.435 --> 34:38.601
How you doing?

34:38.636 --> 34:40.364
Fine.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.732
Um, look...

34:41.766 --> 34:45.500
I was thinking
about everything.

34:45.534 --> 34:47.451
And, um...

34:47.485 --> 34:49.331
you know what?

34:49.367 --> 34:52.934
If you want to take the kids,
you want to move 'em someplace,

34:52.969 --> 34:55.068
even if it's someplace,
you know,

34:55.103 --> 34:56.599
a long way
away from here,

34:56.634 --> 34:58.500
I mean, I'll miss them,
it'll be hard,

34:58.535 --> 35:01.834
but... you should be happy.

35:04.001 --> 35:05.200
Thank you.

35:05.235 --> 35:06.400
All right.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.500
Have you been drinking?

35:09.535 --> 35:10.699
No. No, no.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.299
Sober as a judge.

35:13.334 --> 35:16.667
I just-- I was thinking
about the situation.

35:16.702 --> 35:17.799
And I think maybe

35:17.834 --> 35:20.734
I've been... a little
too harsh about it

35:20.769 --> 35:23.584
and, uh, a little
too hard on you.

35:23.619 --> 35:26.400
And life's just too short,
you know.

35:26.435 --> 35:28.399
Anyways.

35:28.434 --> 35:30.100
Sorry. It's late.

35:30.135 --> 35:31.098
Do you mean

35:31.133 --> 35:32.699
sorry about tonight

35:32.734 --> 35:34.968
or sorry
for saying it too late?

35:36.901 --> 35:38.534
A little bit of both.

35:38.569 --> 35:41.400
This is, uh...

35:41.435 --> 35:43.100
Wow.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.365
For a minute there,

35:45.400 --> 35:47.567
I saw you like you were
a million years ago,

35:47.602 --> 35:50.034
before everything.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.068
Back when I was a dinosaur.

35:53.103 --> 35:54.385
Yeah.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.632
Yeah.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.450
All right.

35:57.485 --> 35:59.233
I'll see you.

35:59.268 --> 36:00.601
See you.

36:00.636 --> 36:01.899
Thank you.

36:01.934 --> 36:03.400
Don't worry about it.

36:21.068 --> 36:22.484
Hey.

36:22.519 --> 36:23.866
Hey.

36:23.901 --> 36:25.434
That new girl...

36:26.767 --> 36:27.884
Maura?

36:27.919 --> 36:28.966
Yeah.

36:29.001 --> 36:31.334
She, uh... it's weird.

36:31.369 --> 36:33.667
She just disappeared.

36:33.702 --> 36:35.232
When?

36:35.267 --> 36:38.233
About 40 minutes
after you left.

36:38.268 --> 36:39.332
Hmm.

36:39.367 --> 36:41.567
What do you think
happened?

36:48.601 --> 36:51.467
I don't know.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.767
Hey.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.334
Hey.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.300
How was
the train?

37:07.335 --> 37:09.200
It's fast.

37:09.235 --> 37:10.265
Yeah.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.100
Hey, let me give you
some dough to cover--

37:12.135 --> 37:13.567
No, no, that's fine.
I got it.

37:13.602 --> 37:14.567
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:18.567 --> 37:20.133
So Mom's good?

37:20.168 --> 37:22.132
Yeah.

37:22.167 --> 37:23.332
She's good.

37:23.367 --> 37:24.467
Maybe after the hearing,

37:24.502 --> 37:26.165
I can stop by,

37:26.200 --> 37:27.734
say hello
before I head back.

37:29.867 --> 37:32.068
Your mother doesn't know
you're here.

37:32.103 --> 37:34.699
Okay.

37:34.734 --> 37:36.033
Jerry, good news.

37:36.068 --> 37:38.200
It's down to the wire,
but we found the bartender.

37:38.235 --> 37:39.867
He's on his way
and he's gonna testify.

37:39.902 --> 37:41.467
That's great.

37:44.367 --> 37:46.968
Excuse me
for a second.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.365
Now does this mean

37:48.400 --> 37:50.300
that my son
won't have to testify?

37:50.335 --> 37:52.198
I don't see
the downside.

37:52.233 --> 37:55.167
Well, he's gotta get back
to Boston, you know.

37:55.202 --> 37:56.818
I feel like
I've taken up

37:56.853 --> 37:58.434
too much
of his time already.

37:58.469 --> 37:59.984
Jerry... this is
your job

38:00.019 --> 38:01.259
we're talking about
here.

38:01.294 --> 38:02.465
I think
we should use

38:02.500 --> 38:05.300
everything
we got... right?

38:08.467 --> 38:09.901
So you saw
the entire incident?

38:09.936 --> 38:11.033
Yes, I did.

38:11.068 --> 38:12.767
It happened not
three feet in front of me.

38:12.802 --> 38:14.718
All right, well,
we've heard Mr. Teff say

38:14.753 --> 38:16.634
that Chief Reilly
threw the first punch.

38:16.669 --> 38:17.599
Is that
what happened?

38:17.634 --> 38:18.799
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

38:18.841 --> 38:21.357
This guy comes in, gets in Teff's face.
He's being verbally abusive.

38:21.434 --> 38:23.065
Whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.033
You heard this?
You heard him being abusive?

38:26.068 --> 38:27.968
Yeah, he was making
all kinds of homophobic remarks.

38:28.003 --> 38:28.999
You could tell

38:29.034 --> 38:30.634
he was itching
for a fight, this guy.

38:30.669 --> 38:31.968
But the bar
was crowded.

38:32.003 --> 38:33.666
You were busy.

38:33.701 --> 38:36.098
Isn't it possible
that Bobby Teff

38:36.133 --> 38:38.968
and not Chief Reilly
threw the first punch?

38:39.003 --> 38:41.634
Remember that
you're under oath here.

38:41.669 --> 38:43.065
Honestly?

38:43.100 --> 38:44.132
Okay, I don't remember.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.968
All I know
is that there was a fight,

38:46.003 --> 38:47.452
and that guy
provoked it.

38:47.487 --> 38:49.443
Thank you.
No more questions.

38:49.478 --> 38:51.400
I'd like to call
Peter Reilly

38:51.435 --> 38:52.934
to the stand, please.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.465
Do you agree

38:57.500 --> 39:00.133
with the prosecutor's portrait
of your father?

39:00.168 --> 39:01.299
No, I do not.

39:01.334 --> 39:03.866
What didn't sound right
about it to you?

39:03.901 --> 39:07.801
My father doesn't have
any hatred toward gay people.

39:07.836 --> 39:08.866
None.

39:08.901 --> 39:11.834
Are you sure
of that?

39:11.869 --> 39:13.167
Totally.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.834
How do you know?

39:19.867 --> 39:22.100
Because I'm gay.

39:24.701 --> 39:26.767
And your father
accepts your choice

39:26.802 --> 39:28.701
and your lifestyle?

39:28.736 --> 39:30.334
He does.

39:32.367 --> 39:34.200
Totally.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.500
Thank you.

39:41.034 --> 39:42.899
Congratulations, Jerry.

39:42.934 --> 39:45.734
I'll file the papers
to get your suspension reversed.

39:45.769 --> 39:47.799
Thanks.

39:47.834 --> 39:49.400
You were
the slam dunk.

39:49.435 --> 39:50.901
Glad I could help.

39:50.936 --> 39:52.367
I'll be
in touch.

39:54.534 --> 39:56.068
So, uh...

39:58.034 --> 40:00.799
Thanks.

40:00.834 --> 40:01.999
You're welcome.

40:02.034 --> 40:04.200
Can I give you a ride
to Grand Central?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.451
Penn Station.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.632
I'm okay.

40:06.667 --> 40:10.534
That's your crew?

40:10.569 --> 40:11.467
Yeah.

40:14.267 --> 40:15.867
You gonna
introduce me?

40:23.034 --> 40:25.034
Next time
you beat up a gay man...

40:26.667 --> 40:29.200
call somebody else.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.200
Hey, uh,
congratulations, man.

40:35.235 --> 40:36.232
See?

40:36.267 --> 40:37.867
Told you it was gonna
be all right.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.132
Yeah, it's all good.

40:39.167 --> 40:41.999
Come on, I need
a goddamn drink.

40:42.034 --> 40:43.934
Hey, chief, I didn't know
you had a son.

40:43.969 --> 40:45.098
How many kids
do you have?

40:45.133 --> 40:46.601
Well, I know
he's got a daughter.

40:46.636 --> 40:47.666
Really?

40:47.701 --> 40:49.233
Yeah, she plays in the NHL.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.334
- Now your son lives in Boston, right?
- Yeah.

40:52.369 --> 40:53.701
You know it's legal
for gay guys

40:53.736 --> 40:54.999
to get married
up there now.

40:55.034 --> 40:57.198
- Come on.
- Now I got a question.

40:57.233 --> 40:59.233
When two gay guys get engaged,
where do they register?

40:59.268 --> 41:00.365
Victoria's Secret?

41:00.400 --> 41:01.734
Or how about
Betsey Johnson maybe?

41:01.769 --> 41:02.984
No, no, no.
The Dildo Hut.

41:03.019 --> 41:04.176
All right, enough, huh?

41:04.211 --> 41:05.299
For crying out loud!

41:05.334 --> 41:07.034
Everything's always
a joke with you guys

41:07.069 --> 41:08.434
when it happens
to somebody else.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.732
Christ.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.267
Although
Betsey Johnson

41:13.302 --> 41:14.767
does have
some nice stuff.

41:16.467 --> 41:17.766
I'm done.

41:17.801 --> 41:19.467
That deserves
a clink of the glasses.

41:19.502 --> 41:20.432
To Betsey.

41:20.467 --> 41:21.933
Hey. Where're
you going?

41:21.968 --> 41:23.400
Home.
Get some sleep.

41:25.934 --> 41:27.767
Listen, Frank, if
I've been an asshole--

41:27.802 --> 41:29.634
Yeah, you have.

41:31.233 --> 41:32.683
I'm sorry.

41:32.718 --> 41:34.098
All right?

41:34.133 --> 41:35.165
It's your life.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.400
I got no business
telling you

41:36.435 --> 41:37.365
what's right
and wrong.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.100
You make
your own decisions.

41:39.135 --> 41:40.801
You got to live
with them.

41:40.836 --> 41:42.198
Yeah, you do.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.033
So we're all right?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.799
Yeah, you prick.

41:45.834 --> 41:47.365
All right.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
I'll see you
tomorrow.

41:48.435 --> 41:49.834
All right.

41:49.869 --> 41:51.198
Here. Thanks.

41:51.233 --> 41:52.767
You're welcome.

42:59.736 --> 43:03.001
All right, Blondie,
come to papa.

43:03.036 --> 43:04.518
You Tommy Gavin?

43:04.553 --> 43:05.966
Who wants to know?

43:06.001 --> 43:07.432
We're Roger's
friends.

43:07.467 --> 43:10.133
That's your problem,
not mine.

43:10.168 --> 43:11.532
What?

43:11.567 --> 43:14.734
What are you guys
gonna do, audit me?
