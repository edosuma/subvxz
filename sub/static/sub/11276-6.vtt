00:05.200 --> 00:06.299
I don't know, Eddie.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.899
Try-try under the bed.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.199
Well, if they're
not there,

00:10.200 --> 00:11.699
look in the back
of the closet,

00:11.700 --> 00:13.399
or behind the
dresser,

00:13.400 --> 00:14.699
or in the washing
machine.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.600
Yeah, if-if you still
can't find them,

00:16.700 --> 00:17.900
call me back.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.299
I swear to God,

00:19.300 --> 00:20.600
that man would
lose his head

00:20.700 --> 00:21.999
if it weren't
bolted on.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.500
What's, uh...
what's up there, Carla?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.899
Eddie wants to
take the twins
for a walk.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.099
Uh, can't find his shoes, huh?

00:27.100 --> 00:29.200
No, he can't
find the twins.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.199
Oh. Excuse me.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.300
No, no, it was my fault.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.499
I'm sorry.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.500
Are you okay?

01:52.501 --> 01:53.799
I'm just fine.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.800
But how nice of you to be
so completely concerned.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.699
Well, you know, you can't be
too careful these days.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.899
Yeah.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.000
So, uh,
when's your baby due?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.300
I'm not pregnant.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.600
Oh. Well, then
I really am sorry.

02:10.699 --> 02:11.900
Excuse me.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.599
Well, why don't you just watch
where you're going then

next time, Buster?!

02:19.400 --> 02:20.200
Sam,

02:20.201 --> 02:21.599
does this outfit
make me look

02:21.600 --> 02:22.999
like I've put on
a little weight?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.699
The outfit?
Uh, yeah, no.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.899
That's what
it must be.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.000
Right, yeah.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.199
Turn around.
Let me see.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.400
Yeah, blame it
on the outfit...

02:31.700 --> 02:33.399
You know, you've been wearing
an awful lot

02:33.400 --> 02:34.899
of fat clothes recently,
haven't you?

02:34.900 --> 02:36.900
Oh, just shut
up, butthead.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.499
She called me a butthead.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
I think I'm gonna cry.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.499
Oh, don't
worry, Sam.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
It only looks that
way from the back.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.500
Want another beer, Mr. P.?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
Love to, Woody, but

02:54.300 --> 02:57.199
I got to get back
to painting Frasier
and Lilith's place.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.099
This is the first job
anyone's given me

02:59.100 --> 03:00.999
in, like, four months,
so I'm not going to do anything

03:01.000 --> 03:02.399
to jeopardize it.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.000
I'm really making an effort
this time

03:04.100 --> 03:05.800
to be the kind
of dependable professional

03:05.900 --> 03:08.300
that I'd like
to have working for me.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.599
See you, Mr. Peterson.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.599
What, Wood?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.299
I said, I'll see you.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.300
Well, damn it, Woody.

03:14.301 --> 03:15.900
Now you made me late, man.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.600
All right, as long as I'm late,

03:18.700 --> 03:20.700
I'll just have another beer,
I guess.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.099
Oh, much
better.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.399
Yes, much
better, yes.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.500
You know, I never thought

03:33.600 --> 03:34.799
our wedding portrait
lived there.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.299
Um, where should it go, Ivan?

03:36.300 --> 03:39.000
Here's a spot.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.500
Perfect.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.600
Why clutter a home
with mementos?

03:47.700 --> 03:49.199
Did I tell you last night

03:49.200 --> 03:52.500
I programmed myself
to dream about your space?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.799
You didn't.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
We're thrilled.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.900
Hmm.

03:56.901 --> 04:00.000
To begin with,
we lose this wall.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.000
Uh, by lose,
do you mean

04:02.100 --> 04:04.099
we redesign it so that it
practically disappears,

04:04.100 --> 04:05.699
or lose, we knock it down

04:05.700 --> 04:07.899
so that we're left
facing the back of our stove?

04:07.900 --> 04:09.600
Hmm... fret not.

04:09.700 --> 04:14.700
We'll be transforming <i>il cucina</i>
<i>into an atrium.</i>

04:14.800 --> 04:15.700
I love this idea.

04:15.701 --> 04:17.300
I adore it.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.200
But what about eating?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.400
I design, I don't eat.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.300
Now, over here I imagine
removing the ceiling

04:27.400 --> 04:29.800
and extending the wall up
to the second story,

04:29.900 --> 04:32.599
culminating in a skylight
to flood the room

04:32.600 --> 04:35.299
with natural illumination.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.599
But, uh...

04:36.600 --> 04:40.199
that's our...
that's our bedroom up there.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.699
Is that all
you people think about,

04:42.700 --> 04:44.400
eating and sleeping?

04:47.600 --> 04:49.700
Tell me this was a gift.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.099
Doctor, might I have a word
with you?

04:56.100 --> 04:58.200
Certainly, Doctor.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.899
How do you feel
about Ivan?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.599
Feel? Look,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.699
the man is one of the most
famous designers in the city.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.299
He's been written up
in every magazine

05:07.300 --> 05:08.999
from <i>Metropolitan Home</i> to <i>HG.</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:10.399
He's got more awards
on his shelves

05:10.400 --> 05:11.599
than we have shelves.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.700
I'd like to beat the crap
out of him.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.199
Maybe we should
let him go.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.600
If that's your final decision,
my cherub, I concur.

05:20.700 --> 05:21.700
The heave-ho.

05:21.701 --> 05:22.899
Wait.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.200
At the risk of
sounding sexist,

05:24.300 --> 05:25.499
I do believe this
is man's work.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.999
It requires
a firm hand.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.800
Please feel free to leave
the room if you must.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.000
This could get
unpleasant.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
Sir.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.400
You're too good for us.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.499
Your masterful design

05:40.500 --> 05:41.800
would make our poor
little lives

05:41.900 --> 05:43.399
just seem drab
by comparison,

05:43.400 --> 05:44.999
and of course,
we'll, uh,

05:45.000 --> 05:46.400
see to your severance
pay, two weeks?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.699
Six months?

05:48.700 --> 05:49.800
IVAN:
Fine.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.999
I can't tell you
what a once-in-a-lifetime thrill

05:53.000 --> 05:54.599
it's been to bask
in your talent.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.699
Uh, bye-bye now.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.299
Watch the steps.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.400
Huh.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.400
I only hope he can recover
from that tongue lashing.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.299
So, dandelion,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.400
now that you've given away
the farm to Ivan,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.400
do you have some
Swiss bank account we can empty

06:11.500 --> 06:12.899
to pay another decorator?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.999
Well, I'll go that one better,
Dove bar.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.399
I submit
that between the two of us,

06:17.400 --> 06:18.699
we have enough taste
and intelligence

06:18.700 --> 06:20.499
to redesign our
own habitat,

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
<i>sans</i> outside help.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.900
Bite me, I love you.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.999
I take back my bite.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.200
We suck.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.399
Much better.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.799
Much better!

07:06.800 --> 07:08.999
Pardon me?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.899
Yes, by simply
moving that chair,

07:10.900 --> 07:13.600
an intimate conversation area
is created,

07:13.700 --> 07:16.599
at the same time, opening up
a new traffic pattern

07:16.600 --> 07:18.299
that gives the entire room

07:18.300 --> 07:21.000
a whole new dynamic
sense of flow.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.300
Plus, I can spackle behind here.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.199
Of course, if...

07:30.200 --> 07:32.199
if you really want a better shot
at the intimate thing,

07:32.200 --> 07:35.699
I'd, uh, take these, uh--

07:35.700 --> 07:37.899
what do you call it--
these Louis Couture's jobbies,

07:37.900 --> 07:40.700
uh, and move them over like so.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.700
Get the table...
over this way.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.999
Okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.899
Now, this table
would have to come

07:46.900 --> 07:48.099
like yea.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.300
Right?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.600
And, uh,

07:50.700 --> 07:52.199
sofa could come around
this way.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.499
Of course.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.300
Okay?

07:55.400 --> 07:56.600
Now, uh,

07:56.700 --> 07:58.899
that desk has got to come out
of there, you put the piano

07:58.900 --> 08:00.599
into the bay,
all right?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.299
That chrome and glass,
you put into the harbor.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
Uh...

08:06.200 --> 08:07.399
I tell you what.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.599
I'd-I-d move
into the warm tones, all right?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.600
Reupholster, redrape,
the whole damn thing.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.399
Splash a little bit
of paisley around.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.799
Throw down a nice

08:14.800 --> 08:16.099
Bukhara rug.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.900
Top it off with a fine piece
or two of chinoiserie,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.400
and we're there.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.800
Well, bite us, Norm,
we love you.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.999
So, uh, what
do you got in
there, Woodski?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.899
Oh, boy.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.200
My Aunt Edna's killer
fudge brownies.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.198
Ooh, killers, huh?

08:40.200 --> 08:41.600
Yeah, they're
called that because
the first time

08:41.700 --> 08:43.400
my Uncle Ford ever
smelled them baking,

08:43.500 --> 08:46.400
he came running in
from the field and
got hit by a combine.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
He hung on for
a few days.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.000
At the end, he was
just praying to die.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.600
Well, eat up,
everybody.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.499
Hi, everybody.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.799
Oh, hey, Rebecca.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.299
Want a brownie?

09:09.300 --> 09:11.599
Oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.900
Moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.100
CLIFF:
You know,
Rebecca,

09:19.200 --> 09:20.999
I don't know why you're so, uh,
concerned about your figure.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.299
You know, back

09:22.300 --> 09:23.600
in the Renaissance
time, uh,

09:23.700 --> 09:24.800
full-figured women
were revered.

09:24.900 --> 09:25.800
Get out.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.800
It's true.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.800
Yeah?

09:27.900 --> 09:28.999
Yeah, yeah.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.699
Artists would only paint big,
voluptuous women.

09:31.700 --> 09:35.200
In fact, that's how they got rid
of a lot of their old paint.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.699
You know,
speaking

09:41.700 --> 09:42.800
of, uh, weight
and stuff,

09:42.900 --> 09:44.100
I got
a riddle.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.400
Which is heavier,

09:45.500 --> 09:47.300
a pound of
Cliff's brain

09:47.400 --> 09:49.800
or a pound of
dead flies?

09:49.900 --> 09:51.399
It's a trick question.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
A pound is a pound.

09:52.401 --> 09:53.700
They both weigh the same.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.700
Go ahead, ask me another
of Mr. Clavin's brain questions.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.599
Okay, let's see.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.900
Uh..
( <i>clears throat</i> )

10:01.000 --> 10:02.500
if you dropped
Cliff's brain

10:02.600 --> 10:04.100
and a bowling ball
off the top

10:04.200 --> 10:05.799
of the Empire
State Building...

10:05.800 --> 10:06.400
Yeah? Yeah?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.600
Well...

10:08.800 --> 10:11.699
Norm, we had to rush over
to tell you.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.699
The new window treatment
you designed just went up.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.000
It is spectacular.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.399
Are you speaking
to another Norm,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.299
or do you have a death wish?

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
Beg your pardon?

10:19.300 --> 10:20.300
Come on, come on.

10:20.301 --> 10:21.600
You think I want these people
to know

10:21.700 --> 10:22.799
I'm an interior decorator?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.699
We're sorry, Norm.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.700
It's just, we simply
cannot moderate
our approbation.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.099
Well, give it a shot,
okay?

10:29.100 --> 10:30.799
But you should
be decorating
professionally.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.199
Oh, no, no, no.
Please.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.499
Doing you folks a favor
was one thing.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.000
Any more
of this interior decorating junk

10:37.100 --> 10:38.699
could really eat
into my reputation

10:38.700 --> 10:42.600
as a lazy, beer-guzzling lump
of mashed potatoes.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.999
But, Norm, you have a gift.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.299
Gift?

10:46.300 --> 10:47.599
Try curse, pal.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.799
I spent my whole damn life
trying to cover up the fact

10:49.800 --> 10:51.299
that I have a great sense
of color,

10:51.300 --> 10:53.499
and I always know
where to stick the ottoman.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.799
Oh, it's a pity.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.299
You see, we've just met
this new couple,

10:56.300 --> 10:57.699
and they-they need a decorator.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.999
Dearest, Norm has made
his feelings clear.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.299
Yes, but they're
very well off.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.699
Frasier, it's not
a matter of money.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.099
They're willing
to pay five figures.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.200
But, Frasier...

11:05.300 --> 11:07.000
Hey, Elvira, back off.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.299
If the left side
of Cliff's brain
leaves New York

11:13.300 --> 11:16.000
on a train traveling
at 65 miles per hour,

11:16.100 --> 11:18.900
and the right side
of Cliff's brain
leaves L.A. on...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.099
Wait, wait, wait.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.500
Let me get a pencil.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
Yeah!

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
Damn, I am good.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.700
Bring these people on.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.899
I'll wipe up the floor
with them.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.000
Who are they, anyhow?

11:52.100 --> 11:53.700
Well, actually, they're friends
of friends.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.899
NORM:
Yeah?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.800
But I have to warn you-- they're
the essence of the Y word.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.099
That's the yuppie word
for yuppie.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.200
NORM:
Oh.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.199
Are you implying
that I'm a yuppie?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.799
Oh, forgive me, I erred.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.499
If I ever do it again,

12:05.500 --> 12:08.000
you may cut out my tongue
and serve it to me in a fajita.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.299
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

12:11.300 --> 12:12.499
Yup, here we go.
Uh-huh.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.600
I'm going to take one last look
in the kitchen.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.999
Hi, we were just
talking about you!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.199
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Kiss-kiss.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.899
Yes, yes.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
Sorry we're late.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
We couldn't decide

12:26.001 --> 12:28.700
whether to take
the Range Rover or the BMW.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.499
Oh but don't keep
us in suspense.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.299
The Beamer.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.499
Well, we're all here now--
what fun.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.400
Uh, Kier Royales all around?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.099
Super.
That'd be
great, Fras.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.099
I can't get over
what your decorator

12:40.100 --> 12:41.600
has done with this place.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.799
It's warm, it's solid.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.600
It's real.
It's super.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.100
Oh, hi, what's going on?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.699
Hi...

12:53.700 --> 12:55.500
Kim and Robert Cooperman,
I'd like you to meet

12:55.600 --> 12:57.300
our decorator,
Norman Peterson.
Hi.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.800
KIM:
How do you do, Norman?
Great.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.499
You know,
this is the last cold beer.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.200
We could split it or something?

13:02.300 --> 13:04.900
No, thanks,
we're taken care of.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.700
Okay, well, suit yourself, huh?

13:06.800 --> 13:07.600
Sit down everybody.

13:07.601 --> 13:10.499
It's beautiful and functional.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.299
You know, uh,
Frasier told me

13:12.300 --> 13:13.499
a little bit
about your place,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.600
so I did take the
liberty of, uh,

13:15.700 --> 13:16.799
jotting down
a few ideas.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.599
Uh... excuse me.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.499
Are those cocktail napkins?

13:21.500 --> 13:24.000
Yeah, I'm sorry,
did you need one?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.399
No.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
Veggie pâté?

13:27.401 --> 13:28.699
Oh, yes, yes, please.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.099
I'm on empty over here.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.300
Anyway...

13:35.500 --> 13:38.099
I heard your place
is pretty modern, you know?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.799
And most of your stuff
is kind of gray.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.299
So I thought, maybe, you know,

13:42.300 --> 13:44.900
some, you know,
color would be good.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.999
Uh, actually, we hadn't
totally sold ourselves

13:49.000 --> 13:50.999
on the concept of change.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.799
NORM:
Oh.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.000
You could keep, uh,

13:54.100 --> 13:55.700
some of your old stuff,
and, you know,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.200
throw in some new stuff, too.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Um...

14:02.100 --> 14:04.099
Fras, uh, could you, uh,

14:04.100 --> 14:07.099
help me with
this wall treatment?

14:07.100 --> 14:08.199
Sushi?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.800
I rolled it myself.

14:10.900 --> 14:11.600
What's going on?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
I'm dying over here.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.700
Well, it's not you, Norm,
it's them.
Yeah?

14:14.800 --> 14:17.400
They're narrow-minded,
trend-sucking dilettantes,

14:17.500 --> 14:19.800
who insist that...

14:19.900 --> 14:21.299
well, their chefs be French,
you know,

14:21.300 --> 14:24.300
that their mechanics be German,
and that their designers be...

14:26.900 --> 14:29.199
...stylish.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.499
Ooh.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.699
You mean, stylish.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.400
Very stylish.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.899
'Nough said, Fras.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.900
I'm sorry, Norm.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.999
This could have been
a real lucrative job for you.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.599
I don't know what to say.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.200
That's okay, I do.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.600
Um...

14:49.600 --> 14:52.099
( <i>sighs</i> )
Listen, uh,

14:52.100 --> 14:54.599
did I tell you that, uh,

14:54.600 --> 14:56.499
last night, I programmed myself

14:56.500 --> 14:59.800
to dream about your... space?

15:12.200 --> 15:13.899
Miss Howe, I don't
mean to insult you,

15:13.900 --> 15:16.099
but you're looking
kind of puny.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.200
Have you lost weight?

15:17.300 --> 15:19.200
Is this a setup?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
Did Sam tell you to say that?

15:22.500 --> 15:25.799
No, ma'am, I told
myself to say it.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.299
Yeah, I'm worried
about you, you know?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.299
If you're not careful, you're
going to start wasting away,

15:29.300 --> 15:31.099
and pretty soon your
ribs will start to show,

15:31.100 --> 15:33.999
like this guy back in
Hanover, Kyle Lefferts.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.300
Of course, he'd
been dead awhile

15:35.400 --> 15:37.000
when they found him.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.699
Thank you, Woody.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.800
That's the nicest thing
anyone's said to me all week.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.700
Your hair's been looking
kind of ratty, too.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.499
Unfortunately,
that's the second nicest thing.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.799
What, no kiss?

15:56.800 --> 15:58.799
No, I've got
to weigh myself.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.699
Oh, we got your scale back here.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.199
What's it doing behind the bar?

16:03.200 --> 16:04.699
We needed it
to settle an argument

16:04.700 --> 16:06.900
about how much
Mr. Clavin's brain weighs.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.900
I think I am in for
a pleasant surprise.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.499
SCALE:
Your weight is 162 pounds.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.299
( laughs )
What?!

16:19.300 --> 16:20.399
SCALE:
Have a nice day.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.799
Malone!

16:22.800 --> 16:23.500
Get out here!

16:23.600 --> 16:26.599
I know what you just did!

16:26.600 --> 16:29.700
Congratulations.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.699
Not you, I was
talking to...

16:31.700 --> 16:32.600
Forget it.

16:32.601 --> 16:33.999
Okay, okay, look.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.600
Cliff's brain
is found murdered in a room.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.300
All the doors
and windows are locked.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.799
Good, he's here.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.499
Hello, Norman!

16:43.500 --> 16:44.699
What's going on?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.199
Oh, hi.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.900
No, no, no, let's,
uh, let's sit up here.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.499
Um, well, Dick
and, uh, Tracy.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.399
How did you ever
track me down?

16:54.400 --> 16:56.299
It's the address
on the cocktail napkin

16:56.300 --> 16:57.699
you did your sketches on.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.500
( gasps )
You're good.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.199
You know, Norman,
we've never been

17:02.200 --> 17:03.500
in a gay bar before.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.799
Yeah.
It seems

17:04.800 --> 17:06.199
just like a regular bar.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.699
Oh, honey.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.700
Look at those two.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.200
Anyway, how about some drinks?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.200
All right. Miss?

17:18.300 --> 17:21.099
Oh, uh, no, no,
I'll take care of it.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.099
He's kind of touchy
since the operation.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.799
Yo, Woodo, uh,

17:28.800 --> 17:31.600
my friends and I need a couple
of, uh, white wine spritzers

17:31.700 --> 17:33.899
and a beer... spritzer.

17:33.900 --> 17:34.900
You feeling okay?

17:34.901 --> 17:38.100
Sure, very manly,
never more so.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.399
Spritzers <i>á trois</i> on the way.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.899
Thank you.

17:42.900 --> 17:46.399
You know, Norman, we didn't just
pop in here on a whim.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.099
We love the work you did
on our place so much

17:49.100 --> 17:52.399
that we want you to do our
mountain retreat next.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.299
( <i>sighs</i> )
Gee, uh, I-I don't know.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.400
My schedule's kind of...

17:55.500 --> 17:56.900
We know it's an inconvenience,
all right,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.599
so can we double your rate?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.999
Only because I love you kids
so much.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.500
Listen, if you could
scope it out this weekend,

18:03.600 --> 18:04.500
that would be super.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.100
Super.

18:05.101 --> 18:06.900
Super!
Super.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.100
( <i>Kim chuckles</i> )

18:08.200 --> 18:09.799
I'm glad you can make it,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.099
because we have another friend

18:11.100 --> 18:12.800
who we've been dying
for you to meet.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.099
And he's really cute.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.499
( <i>Kim laughs</i> )

18:19.500 --> 18:21.599
Um... he?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.100
Unless somebody's
already snapped you up.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.999
Well, yeah, darn it,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.800
I have been snapped up.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.600
By, um...

18:29.700 --> 18:31.500
that fellow over there.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.600
The one who had
the operation?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.499
Bite your tongue! No!

18:36.500 --> 18:38.100
No, the, uh,
tall hunk

18:38.200 --> 18:39.800
rinsing glasses.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.199
Wa-Wait a minute.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.100
Isn't that Sam Malone,
the pitcher?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.299
Oh, I've heard of him.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.900
Didn't he used to play
for the Sox?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Uh...

18:48.001 --> 18:50.399
Yes, yeah,
but now he plays for me.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.500
KIM:
Oh.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.599
Oh, man, the guys at the gym
are gonna freak!

18:57.600 --> 18:58.799
No, um...
Why don't you

18:58.800 --> 18:59.800
bring him over
and introduce him to us?

18:59.900 --> 19:00.800
Uh, I think he's probably

19:00.900 --> 19:02.300
a little bit too busy right now,

19:02.400 --> 19:03.300
um...

19:06.000 --> 19:07.999
All right, all right,
I'll, I'll get him.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.799
( <i>clears throat</i> )

19:09.800 --> 19:11.599
Sam, can I have a word, please?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.299
Yeah, now, come here.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.499
Sam, uh... I need
a favor, pal.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.999
Okay, I have
these clients,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.599
and they're big
fans of yours.
Oh.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
And, uh,
it'd mean a lot

19:19.601 --> 19:21.399
if you could just come
over and say hi to them.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.899
Oh, no problem.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.500
Thanks so much, Sammy.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.400
Thanks, bud.

19:25.401 --> 19:27.199
Oh, and uh,
one more thing, man, okay?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.600
We're lovers.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.400
Kids, this is
Sam Malone.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.899
Sam Malone, this is Kim
and Robert Cooperman.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.600
Pleased to meet you.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.100
You sure do
make a cute couple.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.700
Just accept
the compliment, honey.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.699
Thanks.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.699
I have a confession
to make.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.300
We came in here tonight

19:58.400 --> 20:00.900
to try to fix Norman
up with another man.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.400
Naughty, naughty.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.199
Naughty, naughty.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.299
But since the two of you
are together,

20:10.300 --> 20:12.699
how about if the
four of us spend the
weekend at the cabin?

20:12.700 --> 20:13.900
It'll be a hoot!

20:15.000 --> 20:19.199
Is that good for you, Sam?

20:19.200 --> 20:21.299
What do you mean
is it good for me?

20:21.300 --> 20:22.599
It stinks for me, man.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.400
Come on, I can't.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.000
I can't hack this.
Don't do this to me.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.299
Listen,
I like babe...

20:27.300 --> 20:30.099
I <i>love</i> babes,
and babes love me.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.199
Babes.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.200
Babes.

20:32.201 --> 20:34.399
Babes.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.200
Babes.

20:36.300 --> 20:40.700
"Babes" is his pet word
for linebackers.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.499
Norman, I pride myself

20:42.500 --> 20:44.699
on being a very
perceptive person.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.700
Now, is something amiss?

20:47.600 --> 20:49.499
Yeah.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.000
Sam and I have had a tiff.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.100
Look.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.099
Maybe meeting Michael
is just the thing you need.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.699
I mean, he lives
right around the corner.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.799
Kim, go call him.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.299
No. No-no-no-no-no,
folks, please.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.100
I can't go on with
this any longer.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.599
Look, I don't care if
it costs me the job.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.300
I got to tell you
the truth, okay?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.600
I wanted to be
your decorator,

21:10.700 --> 21:13.399
so I pretended to be who I
thought you wanted me to be,

21:13.400 --> 21:18.299
but... it's time that I
came out of the closet.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.600
I'm straight.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.500
Impossible.
( <i>laughs</i> )

21:24.500 --> 21:26.499
No, no, I-I...

21:26.500 --> 21:28.199
Ever since I
was a little boy,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.399
I've known that
I preferred girls.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.199
Actually, I'm a
guy with a wife.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.499
I mean, uh, I
sleep with Vera.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
Well, you know,
I sleep next to her.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.199
Actually, it's in the room
next to her,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.600
but, uh,
I do keep the door open.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.299
( <i>sighs</i> )
But the point is, you know,

21:46.300 --> 21:49.699
I think you should judge people
for what they do,

21:49.700 --> 21:51.999
not for...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.300
<i>who</i> they do.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You're absolutely right,
Norman.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.899
I can't believe
we've been the perpetrators

21:59.900 --> 22:01.300
of this kind of
discrimination.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.699
( <i>sighs</i> )

22:02.700 --> 22:03.899
We'll see you, Norman.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.199
No, well, listen...
Hey, folks,

22:05.200 --> 22:06.700
I could still, you know,

22:06.800 --> 22:09.599
decorate your mountain
retreat there.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.499
Kim and I happen to be
people of principle, all right?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.899
And we put our trust in you,
our faith.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.100
We trusted you with our most
prized possession, our home.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.599
And how did you
return that trust?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.600
You lied to us,
you betrayed us.

22:21.700 --> 22:24.100
You made fools of us.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.700
I could do it for half price.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.400
Here's the key.

22:26.401 --> 22:28.100
There's Perrier in the fridge.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.700
If the neighbors ask,
you're a plumber.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.099
Gotcha, can do, can do.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.199
Thank you so much.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.700
Thank you.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.100
( <i>sighs</i> )

22:52.100 --> 22:54.300
How 'bout those
Celtics, huh?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.299
What, what,
what, what?

22:59.300 --> 23:00.600
What?
( <i>scoffs</i> )

23:00.700 --> 23:01.700
Norm?

23:01.701 --> 23:03.299
How could you do this to us?

23:03.300 --> 23:04.499
What? Do what?

23:04.500 --> 23:07.399
We're your best friends.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.100
I mean, I can't believe that
you didn't feel close enough

23:10.200 --> 23:13.399
to... share this part
of your life with us.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.599
This part, what?

23:14.600 --> 23:17.299
Guys, I'm straight,
I'm not gay.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.400
No, no.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
Who cares about that?

23:19.501 --> 23:21.400
You can get stuff
at wholesale.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.600
I need a sofa.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.400
Yeah?

23:26.401 --> 23:27.599
And I could use a lamp.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.399
And, uh, can you get me a deal

23:29.400 --> 23:30.500
on a good Bacca lounger?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.000
All right, all right.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.900
But I have to tell you folks
that I am not cheap.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.600
Even for your lover?
