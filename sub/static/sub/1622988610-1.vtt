WEBVTT

02:39.919 --> 02:41.787
Join us, Ted.

02:41.822 --> 02:43.558
It's what Laura
would have wanted.

02:50.732 --> 02:54.470
TED: The Great Pyramid of Giza,

02:54.505 --> 02:57.407
also known as
the Great Pyramid of Khufu,

02:57.442 --> 03:00.938
or if we're going
with the Greek, anyone?

03:01.842 --> 03:02.874
Cheops.

03:03.448 --> 03:04.810
Cheops.

03:04.845 --> 03:07.417
But we don't like the name
that the Greek invaders gave it.

03:07.452 --> 03:10.178
So we stick with the Egyptian
there, right?

03:10.213 --> 03:11.421
Now, construction of the tomb

03:11.456 --> 03:13.115
began the day that
they became pharaoh.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.149
What can we learn from that?

03:25.965 --> 03:26.997
Burton.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.196
Uh, that they were kings

03:28.231 --> 03:30.308
and that they wanted to be
comfortable in the afterlife.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.342
Correct.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.475
As usual, Burton.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.312
-Now, remember,

03:34.347 --> 03:35.610
death is not the end

03:35.645 --> 03:37.546
but a brief pause
on our journey.

03:37.581 --> 03:39.944
And don't forget,
your papers are due next week.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.650
Hey, Mr. Daniels.

03:42.685 --> 03:44.355
Um, I had a question
about the assignment.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.554
-Of course, you do.
-Yeah.

03:45.589 --> 03:47.655
Well, I'm really excited
about the first paper.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.118
Uh, but I'm having a tough time

03:49.153 --> 03:51.725
deciding between the judgment
of the dead by Anubis

03:51.760 --> 03:53.430
or if I should use
my page account

03:53.465 --> 03:54.959
on a deep dive
into mummification.

03:54.994 --> 03:56.730
Definitely the first one.
100%.

03:59.900 --> 04:00.833
I agree.

04:01.506 --> 04:02.835
Uh, thanks, Mr. Daniels.

04:29.468 --> 04:30.896
Did you just say,
"Olive tuse?"

04:31.371 --> 04:32.304
I did.

04:33.769 --> 04:35.197
So drink still?

04:35.232 --> 04:36.165
Mm-hm.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.641
Are you pretending to be madder
than you actually are

04:39.676 --> 04:41.137
because you're trying
to prove a point?

04:41.172 --> 04:42.237
No, I'm not mad.

04:42.272 --> 04:44.316
I'm just being principled,
I'm standing my ground.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.581
We have things to talk about.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.011
That's great.

04:47.046 --> 04:48.881
I'm just excited to have a state
of the union with you again.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.015
I missed you.

04:51.952 --> 04:52.885
Good.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.559
Oh, so are you mad?

04:56.594 --> 04:57.923
Are you not mad?

04:59.762 --> 05:01.762
Furious.

05:09.871 --> 05:12.905
We separated because I didn't
feel like you cared about us.

05:13.545 --> 05:14.775
You say that you care,

05:14.810 --> 05:16.810
but you don't take
the serious things seriously.

05:16.845 --> 05:18.845
Where's the fun in that?

05:18.880 --> 05:20.242
You need to show me
something different.

05:20.277 --> 05:21.353
I'm leaving for good.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.146
And you could stay in this
dump town for all I care.

05:23.181 --> 05:25.984
Come on. Two people
with this much chemistry.

05:26.019 --> 05:28.250
Don't just give up because
they had a rough patch.

05:28.285 --> 05:29.119
I am not giving up,

05:29.154 --> 05:31.462
but I need to know
that you value us.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.288
No half in and half out.

05:33.323 --> 05:34.432
You know, I read somewhere

05:34.467 --> 05:35.994
that the most important things
were said three times.

05:36.029 --> 05:38.964
So, I promise. I promise.
I promise...

05:38.999 --> 05:41.670
that we'll fight for us
this time.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.606
Your mother always told me
you're trouble.

05:43.641 --> 05:44.970
See, we're made for each other.

05:45.005 --> 05:47.005
I get us into trouble,
you get us out.

05:50.076 --> 05:52.615
So we're just done talking?

05:52.650 --> 05:54.716
No, I was just
ordering us drinks

05:54.751 --> 05:56.619
while we continue to talk.

05:56.654 --> 05:59.083
Okay then,
I'll have something pineappley.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.920
Okay.

06:00.955 --> 06:06.464
Hello. Can I get a Mai Tai
and a something pineappley?

06:27.553 --> 06:30.587
Howl called me and he said
that you dumped him for him.

06:30.622 --> 06:31.852
Why are you two together?

06:31.887 --> 06:33.788
Crystal, Ted is my husband.

06:33.823 --> 06:35.020
We're going to work it out.

06:35.055 --> 06:36.989
-Cheers, I'm no longer
being estranged.
-Mm. Oh!

06:37.024 --> 06:38.320
Yeah, now it's just strange.

06:38.355 --> 06:39.497
Crystal.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.796
-That's a good one.
- Shut up!

06:41.831 --> 06:43.325
Does Momma know about this?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.294
Well, we never got divorced
so what is there to know?

06:45.329 --> 06:47.901
He was, is and will always be
my husband.

06:47.936 --> 06:49.199
BARTENDER: God damn it, Howl!

06:49.234 --> 06:50.904
How many times do I have
to ban you from my tiki bar?

06:50.939 --> 06:52.543
It's not my fault
people pick fights with me.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.205
-Will you just get the hell out?
-You get the hell out.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.404
It's my bar.

06:56.439 --> 06:59.616
-TED: Oh, great, everyone.
Howl's here too.
-Move over.

06:59.651 --> 07:00.518
-Move.
-I'm not--

07:02.819 --> 07:04.786
-Oh, you shouldn't have.
-It's for Laura.

07:04.821 --> 07:06.282
Really though
you should not have.

07:06.317 --> 07:07.987
And I got something
to say to you too.

07:08.022 --> 07:09.428
Oh, God!

07:10.860 --> 07:14.257
Laura, your family loves me,
and I love them.

07:14.292 --> 07:16.831
Howl, we went on one date
because mother made me.

07:16.866 --> 07:18.195
I count three dates.
Three.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.669
Running into me
at the grocery store

07:19.704 --> 07:21.165
does not count as a date.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.398
Neither does auditing
my photography class.

07:23.433 --> 07:24.267
Why are you doing this?

07:24.302 --> 07:26.940
Because I'm married
and uninterested.

07:26.975 --> 07:29.712
-Why can't you two process this?
-Because Ted's a loser.

07:29.747 --> 07:31.912
Crystal, what have I
ever done to you?

07:32.409 --> 07:33.551
You're a loser.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.411
Laura, I'm not gonna beg.
I'm giving you a chance here.

07:36.446 --> 07:39.282
HOWL: When your mama told me
that you and Ted...

07:39.317 --> 07:41.119
Ted, that will be a great time
to fight for us.

07:41.154 --> 07:44.287
That was my chance
to prove my quality.

07:44.663 --> 07:46.091
And I did.

07:46.126 --> 07:51.228
Uh, him? Fight like, fight him?
Uh, physical with our fists?

07:54.838 --> 07:57.201
Okay, finish your drink.

08:02.472 --> 08:05.110
-Let's do this, Tracy.
-Don't call me that.

08:05.145 --> 08:06.947
I'm gonna fight you, Trace.

08:06.982 --> 08:09.719
I feel like
my face is falling off.

08:09.754 --> 08:12.051
Don't get into a fight
you can't win.

08:12.086 --> 08:14.185
That's what I've been
trying to say this whole time.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.451
Come on, sis.
Get your husband home.

08:16.486 --> 08:19.058
Can't believe
I'm related to you yahoos.

08:19.599 --> 08:20.565
Oh!

08:23.801 --> 08:26.164
So how'd I do
for my first fight?

08:26.199 --> 08:27.902
-Well...
-

08:27.937 --> 08:30.366
It's the thought
that counts, right?

08:34.108 --> 08:36.207
-Okay, okay, okay.

08:37.408 --> 08:40.310
-

09:55.189 --> 09:58.663
Hey, uh, is there
a gas station in town?

09:59.259 --> 10:00.159
Yep.

10:03.527 --> 10:05.703
Okay, thanks.

10:15.913 --> 10:17.110
Thanks.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.653
Ah, right.

10:25.582 --> 10:27.483
-Keep the change.
-Yep.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.742
What is happening?

11:18.536 --> 11:20.107
You mind try...

11:20.373 --> 11:21.878
Oh!

11:21.913 --> 11:24.474
Must have sexted right off.

11:32.088 --> 11:35.287
I feel like we could
go anywhere...

11:36.422 --> 11:37.553
do anything.

11:38.897 --> 11:40.325
We're just sort of here.

11:43.231 --> 11:45.132
We never should have
left Chicago.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.101
You said you needed your family.

11:47.136 --> 11:49.202
No, we did that for you.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.271
You needed a change.

11:52.306 --> 11:55.076
I thought that being near
my family would be good for us.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.344
They're just weirder
than I remember.

11:59.379 --> 12:03.249
Oh, they're just as weird
as I remember.

12:03.284 --> 12:06.923
We can go back, we'll just
find a bag full of cash

12:06.958 --> 12:09.288
and voila,
we're Chicagoians again.

12:15.164 --> 12:16.834
You're stagnating again.

12:18.629 --> 12:20.805
Well, leaving is not
gonna fix anything.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.235
We just got back together.

12:22.270 --> 12:25.601
Maybe. Maybe not.
I just...

12:25.636 --> 12:27.207
At least, we're trying.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.342
You're gonna get your way
either way, aren't you?

12:30.377 --> 12:32.311
-I'll give you a chance.
-Okay.

12:32.346 --> 12:35.050
Let's take us
out of the equation.

12:35.085 --> 12:37.052
Let the Gods decide.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.922
Heads, we leave.
Tails, we stay.

12:38.957 --> 12:41.551
Uh, I thought I was the one
that got us into trouble.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.618
Not anymore.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.390
I have a vision
for who we can be.

12:45.425 --> 12:46.930
I need you to trust me.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.800
And not be half in and half out.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.935
Either you're in,

12:51.970 --> 12:53.365
or you're out.

12:54.698 --> 12:55.565
Flip the coin.

13:01.144 --> 13:02.110
Best two out of three.

13:02.145 --> 13:03.914
You're such a cheater.

13:06.182 --> 13:07.280
Okay, did I say
best two out of three?

13:07.315 --> 13:08.743
-You did.
-It all rides down...

13:08.778 --> 13:10.646
-This is the whole enchilada.
-Okay. This is so much cheating.

13:10.681 --> 13:12.021
You realize that right?

13:12.056 --> 13:13.924
-And the champion of the world
is...
-So much...World champion.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.991
Okay.

13:15.026 --> 13:16.355
What?

13:16.390 --> 13:18.225
What'd you get? What'd you get?
What'd you get? Show me!

13:18.260 --> 13:20.260
I win, I win...

13:29.942 --> 13:31.040
You wanna ride?

13:31.075 --> 13:33.911
Uh, no, I don't take rides
from cheaters.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.848
I'm kidding.
I some papers to grade.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.080
-But lunch?
-Oh, yeah.

13:38.115 --> 13:39.774
-Okay.
-You're buying.

13:42.922 --> 13:43.778
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:49.786 --> 13:52.864
So after Anubis, this guy,
the jackal,

13:52.899 --> 13:55.064
weighs your heart against
the feather of truth. He...

15:05.103 --> 15:07.532
CRYSTAL: He's been doing
the exact same thing for weeks,

15:07.567 --> 15:10.766
Carrying her ashes everywhere
with him like a frickin weirdo.

15:11.604 --> 15:13.538
Something's got to be said.

15:13.573 --> 15:15.947
I'll go settle
this right now.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.839
Get us all banned.

15:18.875 --> 15:19.808
I'll do it.

15:21.647 --> 15:24.450
MOMMA: We have a tradition
in this family.

15:24.485 --> 15:27.288
You're dead daddy's Side
has been here since

15:27.323 --> 15:28.718
before it was a state.

15:29.490 --> 15:31.622
Everyone is at the farm

15:31.657 --> 15:34.328
and that's where Laura
will rest too.

15:35.562 --> 15:38.893
And Ted stole it from us

15:38.928 --> 15:40.037
He's a thief.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.667
I don't think you need
to do with Mama wants.

15:43.702 --> 15:46.978
But I think you need to
take this seriously.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.441
I am taking it seriously.

15:48.476 --> 15:49.475
No, you're not.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.147
How can you say that?

15:51.182 --> 15:54.777
You're stuck somewhere between
dealing with it and not.

15:58.222 --> 15:59.782
Half in, half out, right?

16:02.325 --> 16:03.489
Hey, Ted.

16:05.856 --> 16:07.999
I'm worried about what's
happening to you.

16:08.859 --> 16:09.968
I don't need your worry.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.036
I need Laura.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.832
She's gone, man.

16:37.019 --> 16:38.689
What do you want, huh?

16:39.362 --> 16:40.460
What should I do now?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.198
Okay, you're dead,

16:42.233 --> 16:43.562
and I know that.

16:43.597 --> 16:45.762
I know that it's on, uh

16:48.338 --> 16:49.568
talking to myself.

16:54.410 --> 16:55.871
No, I'm talking to you.

16:55.906 --> 16:56.839
No.

17:07.423 --> 17:10.457
God Grant was right, I'm...

17:12.923 --> 17:14.164
I'm losing it.

18:01.906 --> 18:02.773
What?

18:04.579 --> 18:06.073
HOWL: Crystal, I got 'em.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.185
You tell your mama.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.044
-Meet you at the well.
- Okay.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.045
Hurry up.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.259
BETH: What do you mean
someone stole your sister?

18:16.294 --> 18:17.293
I thought she was dead?

18:17.328 --> 18:18.987
GRANT: I mean, her ashes.

18:19.022 --> 18:19.889
That makes more sense.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.132
Just let me know if
you hear anything.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.991
-Okay Beth?
- Of course, we'll let you know

18:23.026 --> 18:25.895
Look, I know that what
I've been doing

18:25.930 --> 18:29.272
and how I've been behaving
is been not normal.

18:30.308 --> 18:32.770
But, I need some
help here, man.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.576
Where is she?

18:38.140 --> 18:39.249
I think I know.

18:39.845 --> 18:40.844
Come on.

18:40.879 --> 18:46.080
Hey, Grant, uh, I've
been seeing her,

18:47.292 --> 18:51.855
Laura, and I talk to her.

18:54.464 --> 18:55.892
That's not the way
the world works.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.168
Yeah.

18:57.203 --> 19:00.303
Yeah, but it feels real.

19:04.001 --> 19:07.970
You're just sad right now and
under a lot of stress.

19:10.348 --> 19:11.908
Yeah. Yeah, that makes
more sense.

19:13.516 --> 19:17.617
body fail

19:21.260 --> 19:25.526
this mortal vail

19:39.773 --> 19:44.545
Hallelujah

19:48.749 --> 19:52.784
to ease our pain

19:56.757 --> 20:00.627
All again

20:14.775 --> 20:19.580
Hallelujah

20:28.393 --> 20:29.623
That's Laura's

20:31.187 --> 20:33.187
What else do you plan on
stealing from me today?

20:33.794 --> 20:35.563
MOMMA: Stop, both of you.

20:35.598 --> 20:36.927
She's gone.

20:36.962 --> 20:40.568
We've got to do what we need
to do to put her to rest

20:40.603 --> 20:41.965
and move on.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.278
Join us, Ted.

20:48.545 --> 20:50.105
It's what Laura would
have wanted.

20:52.450 --> 20:56.650
I use this to hold letters
Laura sent me when
you were in Chicago.

21:11.535 --> 21:13.964
You got me and your daddy.

21:13.999 --> 21:17.308
God rest his soul's
worst traits

21:18.674 --> 21:20.872
Stubbornness and smarts.

21:23.140 --> 21:24.744
But we loved you.

21:29.421 --> 21:30.354
ALL: Amen.

21:36.285 --> 21:38.252
HOWL: I'm not good at this
sort of thing

21:40.531 --> 21:41.464
No.

21:42.665 --> 21:43.895
ALL: Amen.

21:49.804 --> 21:52.706
We fought last time
we saw each other

21:55.381 --> 21:58.272
I was always hoping
for that moment where

21:59.814 --> 22:01.979
we'd get each other

22:03.554 --> 22:05.147
And we'd be friends again.

22:05.754 --> 22:07.083
Like, when we were kids

22:11.529 --> 22:12.891
-Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

22:14.532 --> 22:15.762
I'm just glad that

22:16.765 --> 22:19.766
we can all be here
together for this

22:21.033 --> 22:25.772
Lord, our savior and protector

22:26.874 --> 22:30.942
has you back
in his loving bosom.

22:31.681 --> 22:33.241
If we're lucky enough

22:34.651 --> 22:37.751
we will be with you soon.

22:42.318 --> 22:43.394
Amen.

22:45.596 --> 22:47.189
Thank you, Percy.

22:51.899 --> 22:53.536
I don't think I'm ready
to say goodbye.

22:58.169 --> 23:02.303
I don't know, how
to handle you...

23:04.406 --> 23:06.076
you actually being gone.

23:07.684 --> 23:09.145
Just doesn't feel right.

23:11.622 --> 23:13.820
I can make it
right this time.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.153
I can get us out of
trouble, I swear.

23:20.158 --> 23:21.289
Amen.

23:39.716 --> 23:40.715
I have to set her free.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.981
She told me Chicago
is the answer.

23:43.016 --> 23:44.719
-Bullshit
-she did.

23:44.754 --> 23:45.984
-When?
-That's it, just now

23:46.019 --> 23:47.590
I saw her, it's
like a vision.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.251
What, like as a ghost?

23:50.727 --> 23:52.628
I mean, you so completely...

23:52.663 --> 23:53.563
Give it to me!

23:54.060 --> 23:55.961
Hey, It's his wife.

23:55.996 --> 23:57.358
Just let him go.

24:00.869 --> 24:02.000
What!

24:53.625 --> 24:54.855
I don't accept
your apology.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.483
You want to know why Because
you're the one that brought him

24:56.518 --> 24:57.957
over here and this
would have happened

24:57.992 --> 24:59.090
if you didn't do that, Grant.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.564
And why are you walking
away from me?

25:00.599 --> 25:01.928
I'm speaking to you.

25:01.963 --> 25:03.061
Listen, calm down.

25:03.096 --> 25:04.766
That is literally
the worst thing

25:04.801 --> 25:06.130
that he could have
ever said to me.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.605
What are you doing here?

25:13.678 --> 25:14.710
I can't swim.

25:14.745 --> 25:15.744
Unbelievable.

25:15.779 --> 25:16.943
Wow.

25:17.913 --> 25:20.012
What now? Huh?

25:20.047 --> 25:21.475
Just let it go, Okay?

25:21.510 --> 25:23.521
The cars. The cars!

26:10.999 --> 26:12.427
I want to report
a stolen car.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.396
You know who stole it?

26:14.431 --> 26:15.265
Radio it in.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.366
He just told you where
he was going.

26:22.945 --> 26:24.076
Don't look at me.

26:29.347 --> 26:30.786
Theft.

26:30.821 --> 26:32.854
Get a stolen Dodge RAM truck.

26:32.889 --> 26:34.284
Color red.

26:34.319 --> 26:35.659
Good amount of rust on it.

26:36.486 --> 26:37.452
Tag number.

26:38.697 --> 26:41.126
How am I supposed to know
the goddamn license plate

26:41.161 --> 26:43.029
to my own truck off
the top of my head?

26:46.001 --> 26:47.638
It's Howl's truck.

26:47.673 --> 26:48.969
Ted stole it.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.839
You still looking
for ashes in?

26:50.874 --> 26:51.807
No.

26:53.910 --> 26:56.042
Well, yes.

26:57.947 --> 26:59.309
We've got to get her back.

27:03.282 --> 27:04.413
Not you.

27:06.582 --> 27:07.724
Yes, Momma.

27:39.956 --> 27:41.857
You got a quarter?

27:41.892 --> 27:43.221
Lighten this place
up a bit, huh?

27:47.062 --> 27:48.193
Yeah.

27:51.462 --> 27:52.593
Coming, okay.

28:56.065 --> 28:57.361
Best two out of three.

28:57.759 --> 28:59.132
You're on.

28:59.167 --> 29:00.562
: Ro Sham Bo

29:02.038 --> 29:04.038
Scissors two times in a row.

29:04.073 --> 29:06.634
And it's all tied up.

29:06.669 --> 29:11.309
Headed into the Universal
World championship of

29:11.344 --> 29:15.753
Who will fill out
the paperwork this time?

29:18.956 --> 29:20.285
BOTH: Ro, sham, bo.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.419
Oh, and he's done it

29:22.454 --> 29:25.356
The incredibly risky strikes

29:25.391 --> 29:29.030
Scissor strategy has won it

29:32.002 --> 29:34.299
He takes home the cup.

29:34.334 --> 29:36.763
Yeah, a cup of piss.

29:36.798 --> 29:37.841
My piss.

29:38.877 --> 29:39.909
This isn't fair.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.575
And he forgot his
ticket book.

29:50.317 --> 29:51.822
Forgot my ticket book.

29:57.456 --> 29:59.995
There you go. Now it's easy.

30:13.505 --> 30:17.771
Seem to break

30:17.806 --> 30:24.646
of soul of our hearts
with a hasty word

30:24.681 --> 30:29.057
to recall, honey child

30:29.092 --> 30:33.160
Honey doll, honey-pie

30:35.164 --> 30:41.399
if this here boy done
broke your heart last night

30:41.434 --> 30:45.766
honey baby, honey doll,
honey-pie

30:45.801 --> 30:51.849
the most of all

31:01.058 --> 31:01.991
Shoot for it?

31:26.347 --> 31:29.249
Hurt at all

31:29.284 --> 31:35.519
the sweetest rose

31:35.554 --> 31:38.819
the petals fall

31:38.854 --> 31:44.968
the kindest heart

31:45.003 --> 31:48.796
you can't recall

31:48.831 --> 31:54.736
Your heart last night

31:54.771 --> 31:57.805
most of all

32:23.635 --> 32:26.141
Any idea who owns
the pickup truck out front?

32:27.342 --> 32:28.473
Yep.

32:33.315 --> 32:35.348
WOMAN: Well, hello again.

32:35.383 --> 32:37.020
It's your first time
running from the cops?

32:37.055 --> 32:39.187
I'm not a 100% sure
they're chasing me.

32:42.390 --> 32:44.687
-Sir?
-Oh, they're chasing you.

32:45.195 --> 32:47.822
Question is, why?

32:47.857 --> 32:51.067
My wife, she died.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.201
And I have to scatter her ashes.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.730
POLICEMAN: Sir?

32:55.931 --> 32:59.042
-What's the hurry?
-Her family has other plans.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.978
Sir? Ma'am?

33:01.937 --> 33:03.211
-Get in.
-Yeah.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.974
-I'm Amber.
-Sir?

33:08.009 --> 33:09.019
It goes there.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.156
Jesus Christ, why is it
full of acorns?

33:49.952 --> 33:51.193
That's Sam.

33:53.329 --> 33:54.625
He's gone, too.

33:55.925 --> 33:59.861
You know, I saw you at the bar,
I knew we were connected.

34:01.139 --> 34:02.171
Fellow travelers

34:06.639 --> 34:08.606
I'm supposed be on my way.

34:08.641 --> 34:11.906
Oh, sure. I mean,
you could totally do that.

34:11.941 --> 34:15.514
Totally could.
But, here's what I'm thinking.

34:15.549 --> 34:21.223
I'll make us some dinner. Okay.
A couple of these and then
first thing tomorrow, Heathrow.

34:23.590 --> 34:28.494
Yeah, that's really nice,
but I'm going to Chicago.

34:28.529 --> 34:31.629
AMBER: Okay. Well then,
how about Des Moines?

34:32.434 --> 34:34.071
That's still a long way.

34:35.536 --> 34:38.636
What? No one knows you're here.

34:38.671 --> 34:41.210
You could take
one night to rest.
It'll be fun.

34:42.444 --> 34:43.608
-Uh.
-AMBER: Come on.

34:45.612 --> 34:46.941
-Yeah?
-AMBER: Yeah.

34:48.351 --> 34:49.218
Okay.

35:01.166 --> 35:04.827
I mean, it don't...
don't hurt now, I guess.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.771
TED: It is believed that
a portion of the dead
pharaoh's spirit

35:47.806 --> 35:50.213
was left behind after death.

35:50.248 --> 35:54.448
That portion is called the Ka,
which is ridiculous,

35:54.483 --> 35:57.385
because when you're dead,
you're gone.

35:57.420 --> 36:02.148
It's also believed, wrongly that
that spirit needed proper care.

36:02.183 --> 36:04.755
So that the dead Pharaoh
could continue his rule

36:04.790 --> 36:07.087
over the dead in the afterlife.

36:09.190 --> 36:10.365
Afterlife...

36:15.273 --> 36:16.206
All this.

36:19.574 --> 36:22.608
When really, the only
afterlife is,

36:22.643 --> 36:24.412
is those of us
who are left behind.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.219
When really, the only

36:30.717 --> 36:32.079
afterlife is,

36:38.956 --> 36:42.925
Good job today. You can go now
and finals are next week.

37:00.241 --> 37:02.109
I love you.

37:03.651 --> 37:05.222
I love you too, man,

37:07.556 --> 37:09.182
I said I love juice.

37:10.823 --> 37:12.427
Yeah, me too, man.

37:23.605 --> 37:25.539
Well, the keys are missing.

37:25.574 --> 37:31.314
So, I walk into the bar
and there's this guy dancing
like a weirdo.

37:31.349 --> 37:36.715
And then he looks at me
directly into my eyes
and he runs out of the place.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.211
I mean, that's weird, right?

37:38.246 --> 37:40.752
-Even for this town,
-Sounds like Ted.

37:40.787 --> 37:42.292
You hear what I said?
The keys are missing.

37:42.327 --> 37:45.361
Dingus here forgets the plates
to the getaway car.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.429
-I'm really sorry about that.
-Hey, the forms.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.631
-Best two or three.
-Winner takes all, one go.

37:51.666 --> 37:53.094
Go, game, four.
-Yes.

37:53.129 --> 37:54.062
Damn it.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.965
I got some forms for you guys
to fill out.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.835
The keys are missing.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.441
Fill em out your own damn self.

38:07.011 --> 38:09.286
So, why all the way to Chicago?

38:11.279 --> 38:17.327
Well, when I was a grad student,
I studied anthropology, and we
loved going to the field museum.

38:19.320 --> 38:23.058
Our favorite thing to do was
to go to this exhibit
on ancient Egypt.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.929
-We'd go all the time.
-We never made it there.

38:26.767 --> 38:28.899
Oh, you should...
It's beautiful.

38:29.836 --> 38:34.201
Yeah, they have
these machines there.

38:34.236 --> 38:37.644
I don't know if they have them
anymore, but they did.

38:37.679 --> 38:39.811
The Mold-o-Rama.

38:39.846 --> 38:43.177
It's this plastic injection
molded figurine

38:43.212 --> 38:47.181
for dinosaurs,
and we just loved them.

38:49.152 --> 38:52.791
So, yeah, I'm going there
to scatter her.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.928
-Her ashes at the museum?
-Mhm.

38:59.228 --> 39:02.328
They probably don't let you
scatter ashes at the museum.

39:02.363 --> 39:08.037
-I mean, probably not.
-Yeah, I know, probably not.

39:09.777 --> 39:12.074
I guess I'm not really sure
what I'm doing.

39:13.616 --> 39:17.981
Yeah, I bet. What with you being
new to crime and all that.

39:18.885 --> 39:22.051
-I normally don't do this.
-Do what?

39:23.923 --> 39:29.124
This, or anything, I guess.

40:21.277 --> 40:26.280
We used to build statues,
to heroism and victory
and death.

40:27.690 --> 40:30.427
It's so romantic,
don't you think?

40:33.597 --> 40:35.432
Yes, beautiful.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.325
And everlasting.

40:39.933 --> 40:42.439
Death used to be so audacious.

40:43.541 --> 40:47.939
Nothing says, "I was here,"
like a monument.

40:47.974 --> 40:49.303
Yeah, but where would you
put it?

40:50.141 --> 40:53.945
Just the idea of it, you know.

40:53.980 --> 40:56.453
If you can't make a statement
with your death, then

40:57.720 --> 40:59.049
what did your life mean?

41:00.052 --> 41:01.557
Wait, are you asking me?

41:03.451 --> 41:06.254
No, I'm asking this guy.

41:08.764 --> 41:11.127
I'm not sure we can wait
for a response.

41:12.702 --> 41:15.098
Museum is closing.
Let's go home.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.738
Home is nice.

41:17.773 --> 41:20.972
Home is nice.
But, this is nicer.

41:45.966 --> 41:47.229
Amber?

42:37.380 --> 42:40.150
What is this?
What are you doing?

42:40.185 --> 42:42.988
-Hey, stop.
-I'm doing this for you, Ted.

42:43.023 --> 42:46.420
You said so yourself.
You need to get over her.

42:46.455 --> 42:48.389
I'm not ready. This isn't right.

42:48.424 --> 42:52.393
Nothing needs to change.
And we could all be
so happy here.

42:52.428 --> 42:53.834
That's not what she wanted.

43:00.106 --> 43:02.711
You have no idea what she wanted

43:04.308 --> 43:06.682
You weren't even with her
when she died.

43:07.982 --> 43:10.851
I held Sam's hand as he left me.

43:12.723 --> 43:16.692
You're feeling guilty
'cause you weren't there
for her.

43:22.997 --> 43:25.800
You could stay here with me.

43:32.875 --> 43:35.172
Maybe, she's right.

43:36.978 --> 43:39.440
No, it can't be here.

43:41.246 --> 43:44.214
This is not right.

43:47.615 --> 43:48.625
I have to keep going.

44:42.637 --> 44:46.276
Hot. Diggity. Dog.

44:50.051 --> 44:51.347
Oh shit.

44:53.516 --> 44:55.054
Need a ride?

44:55.089 --> 44:57.320
No, thanks. I'm just gonna...

45:37.758 --> 45:40.132
Laura told me all about you,
Teddy boy.

45:40.167 --> 45:43.003
-Oh, yeah, Tracy?
-Don't call me that.

45:49.242 --> 45:52.881
Why don't you get together
with Crystal? You two are
perfectly made for each other.

45:52.916 --> 45:56.852
-Don't change the subject.
-I'm not. It's perfectly
on topic.

45:56.887 --> 46:00.680
-I'm not going to let you
trick me.
-I'm not trying to trick you.

46:01.782 --> 46:03.320
I want you to be happy.

46:03.355 --> 46:06.653
How dumb do you think I am?

46:06.688 --> 46:09.491
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

46:20.339 --> 46:24.770
If Laura talked about us so much
you'd know how important
Chicago is.

46:24.805 --> 46:28.213
HOWL: She talked about
how you couldn't handle
getting fired...

46:28.248 --> 46:33.284
from your cush teaching gig,
melted down, moved to Colorado.

46:34.287 --> 46:37.486
Her family loves me, not you.

46:37.521 --> 46:40.830
Because all you do is
screw things up.

46:40.865 --> 46:44.493
You know what?
I don't even care about
her ashes anymore.

46:44.528 --> 46:48.761
I'm just here to beat you
because Laura deserved better.

46:48.796 --> 46:50.466
God damn it, Tracy,

46:51.172 --> 46:52.732
Oh, shit.

48:23.968 --> 48:27.970
Hi. I think I got lost.

48:32.009 --> 48:35.670
Uh... is that the highway?

48:36.739 --> 48:40.576
Highway was moved... years ago.

48:40.611 --> 48:43.744
It's 15 minutes' walk now
or 4 if you drive.

48:44.615 --> 48:47.022
-That way?
-That way.

48:47.057 --> 48:49.420
No, no, it's that way.

48:50.489 --> 48:53.754
-Wasn't that where Fox's is?
-No, that's that way.

48:54.196 --> 48:56.592
Oh. Uh, yeah.

48:57.727 --> 48:59.562
Wh... Where's Des Moines?

48:59.597 --> 49:00.794
-That way.
-This way.

49:03.733 --> 49:06.701
-So east is...
-That's west.

49:08.969 --> 49:10.375
So, I need to go...

49:10.410 --> 49:11.981
MAN: Has it always
been that way?

49:12.016 --> 49:14.082
WOMAN: That's why they put
the highway over there.

49:14.117 --> 49:15.578
Huh.

49:15.613 --> 49:19.549
This area is a puzzle.

49:40.341 --> 49:42.638
-Is it you?
-It is.

49:43.872 --> 49:45.443
You're not... You're not dead?

49:45.478 --> 49:49.480
Uh, no, Ted,
but you got beat up again.

49:49.515 --> 49:50.943
Am I dreaming?

49:50.978 --> 49:53.583
You're not dreaming.
Me, yes, dead.

49:54.916 --> 49:57.620
What are you? Are you...
Are you like a ghost
or something?

49:57.655 --> 50:00.491
Wow. That's like asking a fish,
"How's the water?"

50:00.526 --> 50:01.888
-Huh?

50:01.923 --> 50:04.957
-Well, fish doesn't see water.
-Do we know that?

50:04.992 --> 50:08.103
I don't know the rules, Ted.
I... I don't know how.

50:08.138 --> 50:09.599
How... How doesn't matter?

50:09.634 --> 50:13.207
-Why? Why matters.
-Why are you here?
Why are you back?

50:14.342 --> 50:18.542
-I'm not sure. Where am I?
-Nebraska.

50:18.577 --> 50:21.050
No, we're, uh, in Iowa.

50:21.085 --> 50:23.778
You know what,
I'm not 100% on that either.

50:23.813 --> 50:26.946
But where am I? Like, me.

50:27.751 --> 50:29.850
Lost.

50:29.885 --> 50:33.623
Well, partner, I guess I'm here
to help you get me back.

50:36.331 --> 50:37.990
You need to hail this car.

50:38.025 --> 50:40.399
Hey, this car, right now.
Stick your hand up.

50:40.434 --> 50:44.304
-Come on. They can't see me.
-Oh, I missed you so much.

50:44.339 --> 50:47.373
-LAURA: They can't see me.
-TED: Oh.

50:47.408 --> 50:48.869
LAURA: That was our ride.

50:52.512 --> 50:53.676
Come on.

50:56.582 --> 50:58.681
Hello. Thank you for stopping.

50:58.716 --> 51:00.122
-Where you headed?
-Uh...

51:00.157 --> 51:02.916
Whoa, man.
What happened to your face?

51:02.951 --> 51:05.050
Cool.
-LAURA: You should see
the other guy?

51:05.085 --> 51:08.262
-Hey, shut up!
-LAURA: They can't see me.

51:09.991 --> 51:13.531
-I see that.
-So, you headed west?

51:13.566 --> 51:15.467
-Where are we headed?
-West.

51:15.502 --> 51:16.963
And remember,
no one else can see me.

51:16.998 --> 51:18.701
But, wait, don't we...
We don't want to go east?

51:18.736 --> 51:20.868
LAURA: I do not think
Howl would go east.

51:20.903 --> 51:22.540
Plus, we need to be sensitive
to the fact that

51:22.575 --> 51:24.146
-no one else can see me.
-No one else can see you.

51:24.181 --> 51:29.184
-Right. Um... West is best.
-ALL: Great.

51:29.219 --> 51:30.680
Huh.

51:33.619 --> 51:35.047
So, what happened?

51:35.082 --> 51:38.292
Uh... I got into a fight
with my dead wife's boyfriend.

51:38.327 --> 51:39.425
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

51:41.891 --> 51:46.333
Boyfriend, yeah

51:47.633 --> 51:48.830
What's happening?

51:48.865 --> 51:50.766
What's happening?

51:53.705 --> 51:56.068
-Is this the only way?

52:00.184 --> 52:03.449
Are you guys gonna sing
everything that I say?

52:05.981 --> 52:08.883
Oh, I think there's
a store coming up
that we need to stop at.

52:08.918 --> 52:09.917
Uh, why?

52:09.952 --> 52:11.985
Well, I'm sort of just
winging this right now.

52:12.020 --> 52:12.953
Well, you do it.

52:12.988 --> 52:15.659
I can't. I have to
operate through you.

52:15.694 --> 52:17.430
So, you know,
you have to do what I say.

52:17.465 --> 52:19.168
Just no jokes, no commentary.

52:19.203 --> 52:20.092
-Just do.
-Okay.

52:20.127 --> 52:23.029
Uh, hey, guys,
there's a store coming up.

52:23.064 --> 52:24.404
Uh, I think
we should stop at it.

52:24.439 --> 52:25.867
We're running out of Band Aids.

52:25.902 --> 52:29.772
To get bandages for...

52:30.445 --> 52:31.675
Wait, what's your name?

52:36.286 --> 52:37.483
Ted.

52:46.054 --> 52:46.987
Hey.

52:56.504 --> 52:59.802
So how did it...
How did it happen?

53:00.706 --> 53:01.771
How'd I die?

53:03.313 --> 53:06.105
-I was driving along,
enjoying my music.
-

53:06.140 --> 53:08.074
I noticed there was
a fly in the car.

53:08.945 --> 53:10.780
I tried to get it out.

53:10.815 --> 53:12.254
It flew to the window.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.487
I rolled down the window,
it totally flew out, success!

53:14.522 --> 53:15.719
Yeah! Oh...

53:15.754 --> 53:17.083
Drove right off the road.

53:18.020 --> 53:21.725
Wow, that's so unsatisfying.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.023
Tell me about it.

53:23.696 --> 53:26.092
Buy this. Oh.

53:28.866 --> 53:30.305
You still have that quarter?

53:31.506 --> 53:32.769
No.

53:32.804 --> 53:34.606
You lost our special quarter.

53:34.641 --> 53:38.203
This crazy lady stole it from me
and made me do this crazy dance.

53:38.238 --> 53:41.173
Oh. I don't know
what to think about that.

53:41.208 --> 53:44.418
Things have just been
really weird since
I've seen you last.

53:46.917 --> 53:49.148
-That's stealing.
-Is it?

53:51.185 --> 53:54.626
Hey, I've been
so lost without you.

53:54.661 --> 53:58.124
-You were pretty lost with me.
-

53:58.159 --> 54:01.226
What are we...
What are we even doing here?

54:01.261 --> 54:02.469
Shopping.

54:02.504 --> 54:05.703
Okay. Can we just slow down?
Can we just stop for a second.

54:05.738 --> 54:07.639
I... I never thought that
I would see you again,

54:07.674 --> 54:09.344
and now, I see you again.

54:09.379 --> 54:13.678
And... I just want to tell you
that I'm sorry.

54:13.713 --> 54:16.450
I appreciate the need
to unburden your soul,

54:16.485 --> 54:19.288
but it feels like, again,
that's become my problem.

54:19.323 --> 54:21.213
And now I'm stuck
in this weird limbo,

54:21.248 --> 54:23.820
and I'm only here because
you couldn't figure out
what to do with my ashes.

54:23.855 --> 54:26.394
And... And now I'm lost.
Or my ashes are anyway.

54:26.429 --> 54:28.220
And my whole family
wants you arrested.

54:28.255 --> 54:30.992
Oh, um, I'm sorry
about that, too, right now.

54:31.027 --> 54:33.995
I can't do anything
with sorry. Action, Ted!

54:35.570 --> 54:36.866
Okay.

54:38.408 --> 54:40.771
Uh... action.

54:40.806 --> 54:42.773
Uh, so, what?
What do you want me to do?

54:42.808 --> 54:44.841
-Pick one of these.
-I pick that one.

54:47.208 --> 54:50.011
What's going on
with this ensemble?

54:50.046 --> 54:51.386
Oh, yeah, the crazy lady.

54:51.421 --> 54:53.949
This is her... This is her
dead husband's clothes.

54:55.117 --> 54:58.888
I told you,
things have been really weird.

54:58.923 --> 55:02.859
Are you sure you're not
a figment of my imagination
or a projection of something?

55:02.894 --> 55:05.466
I don't feel like
a figment of your imagination?

55:05.501 --> 55:06.764
I feel real.

55:06.799 --> 55:08.634
I mean, as real
as a ghost can be.

55:08.669 --> 55:11.098
A ghost that
only you can see. No.

55:11.133 --> 55:14.266
-How do you know?
-Do you know where my ashes are?

55:15.137 --> 55:17.379
Howl has 'em.
It's the best I got.

55:17.414 --> 55:19.172
So that proves it.

55:19.207 --> 55:20.877
Because there are things I know,
like what we have to do

55:20.912 --> 55:24.045
to get my ashes back,
so I can't be a figment
of your imagination,

55:24.080 --> 55:26.883
because that would be
impossible. That's nice.

55:26.918 --> 55:28.082
Yeah, that would be

55:28.117 --> 55:30.392
the most impossiblest part
of this situation.

55:32.022 --> 55:34.891
Also buy the lighter.
It's the last thing, I promise.

55:35.531 --> 55:37.025
Fine.

55:37.060 --> 55:40.864
And also,
buying this bouncy ball.

55:40.899 --> 55:43.405
-LAURA: Why?
-Out of spite.

55:45.970 --> 55:47.607
He does that all the time.

55:47.642 --> 55:50.445
There's an abandoned
drive-in movie theater
three miles down the road.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.304
You need to get them
to stop there for the night.

55:52.339 --> 55:55.945
-Uh, please fill me in here.
-You said you would trust me.

55:55.980 --> 55:58.310
TED: There's an abandoned
movie theater about
three miles up the road.

55:58.345 --> 55:59.850
I think we should
stop there for the night.

55:59.885 --> 56:02.017
Oh, my God.
Are you going to kill us?

56:02.052 --> 56:04.789
-Am I supposed to murder them?
-Unfortunately, no.

56:04.824 --> 56:07.088
Classic. Murdered by
a hitchhiker.

56:07.123 --> 56:09.354
-Cool.
-No, no murdering.

56:09.389 --> 56:11.664
We're just going to
sleep there for the night

56:11.699 --> 56:15.833
-Make a fire, Sing some songs.
-Make a fire, Sing some songs.

56:18.365 --> 56:19.969
Great.

57:26.400 --> 57:30.402
-I'm going to get
some more wine.
-Go ye, wood nymphs.

57:30.437 --> 57:34.340
-Gather kindling in yonder wood.
-

57:34.375 --> 57:37.552
You know, you're a lot funnier
now that you're dead,
you know that.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.653
-Oh.

57:41.382 --> 57:43.217
You do realize I'm the one
that's still getting us

57:43.252 --> 57:46.220
-out of trouble, right?
-Mm. Made for each other.

57:59.642 --> 58:01.840
The lily-white boys

58:08.343 --> 58:12.378
Green grow the rushes, O

58:12.413 --> 58:16.822
Four for the gospel-makers

58:21.323 --> 58:23.389
The lily-white boys

58:36.470 --> 58:38.371
At your door

58:45.083 --> 58:47.182
The lily-white boys

58:59.966 --> 59:02.296
Proud walkers

59:02.331 --> 59:04.265
At your door

59:11.307 --> 59:13.307
The lily-white boys

1:00:37.525 --> 1:00:39.261
TED: So, what do we do now?

1:00:40.198 --> 1:00:42.671
Now you make
a decoy of the ashes.

1:00:44.301 --> 1:00:46.103
That's why you had me
buy that stuff.

1:00:46.138 --> 1:00:48.842
-Yes.
-Why didn't you just
tell me that?

1:00:48.877 --> 1:00:49.876
I don't know.

1:00:55.785 --> 1:00:59.149
Our last morning together,
you said you wanted
the gods to intervene.

1:00:59.184 --> 1:01:01.514
Perhaps I shouldn't have
tempted fate.

1:01:01.549 --> 1:01:03.549
Do you think that
we would have figured it out?

1:01:04.761 --> 1:01:06.222
If we had tried, maybe.

1:01:06.257 --> 1:01:08.224
-Were you gonna to try?
-Yes.

1:01:08.259 --> 1:01:12.393
I just... I some...
I let dumb shit
get in the way sometimes.

1:01:12.428 --> 1:01:15.528
Would you have ever scattered me
if Howl hadn't stolen them?

1:01:16.333 --> 1:01:18.663
Yeah, wh... When you died,

1:01:18.698 --> 1:01:20.973
I just wanted everything
to stay the same.

1:01:21.008 --> 1:01:22.370
I wanted to have
the same breakfast,

1:01:22.405 --> 1:01:24.636
the same lunch, the same dinner,

1:01:24.671 --> 1:01:27.243
and there's a part of me
that still does.

1:01:28.246 --> 1:01:30.719
I'm worried that
if I say good bye to you,

1:01:30.754 --> 1:01:33.854
and if I actually
let you go, then...

1:01:33.889 --> 1:01:36.285
there's not going to be
anything left of me either.

1:01:37.926 --> 1:01:40.520
I'm so alone and I'm miserable.

1:01:40.555 --> 1:01:41.587
Oh, good.

1:01:42.359 --> 1:01:44.865
-What?
-He's going to breakfast

1:01:53.370 --> 1:01:56.844
-TED: Oh... good.
-LAURA: Come on.

1:01:56.879 --> 1:01:57.845
TED: Oh...

1:01:59.145 --> 1:02:01.211
Hey, did you
know that all along?

1:02:17.757 --> 1:02:18.723
Crap!

1:02:18.758 --> 1:02:20.164
How do we get in?

1:02:20.199 --> 1:02:21.396
Just try the handle.

1:02:22.267 --> 1:02:23.662
Do you have magic?

1:02:23.697 --> 1:02:24.938
What are you
talking about?

1:02:24.973 --> 1:02:26.005
What are you
talking about?

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:27.336
This is basic
motel security.

1:02:27.371 --> 1:02:30.273
The doors lock
on their own. See!

1:02:32.508 --> 1:02:34.409
Howl has a weird
relationship with locks.

1:03:45.548 --> 1:03:46.712
LAURA: We got to go.

1:03:48.254 --> 1:03:50.188
Ted, Howl's parking.

1:03:50.223 --> 1:03:51.156
Wait. Wait.

1:03:52.258 --> 1:03:54.555
So... this is it?

1:03:58.231 --> 1:03:59.626
I love you.

1:04:03.038 --> 1:04:04.598
Go out the window.

1:04:06.371 --> 1:04:07.502
Okay.

1:04:44.772 --> 1:04:46.838
-Yeah?
-CRYSTAL: You ready to go?

1:04:46.873 --> 1:04:48.114
I'll leave in like,
ten minutes.

1:04:48.809 --> 1:04:50.215
Did you already get breakfast?

1:04:50.250 --> 1:04:51.282
Yeah.

1:04:51.317 --> 1:04:53.482
Wow.
Thanks for the invite.

1:04:53.517 --> 1:04:55.715
-Okay. Bye.
- You know, I'm hungry...

1:05:21.479 --> 1:05:23.644
Uh, it's incredibly lucky.

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:39.231
Look!

1:06:16.501 --> 1:06:18.732
I'm gonna wait you out,
teddy boy.

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:20.899
Yeah, well, I have
all the time in the world

1:06:22.507 --> 1:06:25.442
You got ten minutes
before you run out of gas.

1:06:36.587 --> 1:06:38.818
You win, Howl.

1:06:38.853 --> 1:06:41.128
Can we just
end this. Please?

1:06:41.163 --> 1:06:42.327
Right here.

1:06:42.362 --> 1:06:43.394
Right now.

1:06:43.429 --> 1:06:45.066
Teddy, Come on.

1:06:45.101 --> 1:06:50.764
I am faster, stronger,
better than you.

1:07:14.493 --> 1:07:15.624
What?

1:07:16.297 --> 1:07:17.263
I need a ride.

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:19.133
Is there a problem?

1:07:19.168 --> 1:07:20.398
Says, he needs a ride.

1:07:20.433 --> 1:07:21.597
-Where?
-How?

1:07:21.632 --> 1:07:22.961
We got what we came for.

1:07:22.996 --> 1:07:24.666
Did Ted steal
your truck again?

1:07:24.701 --> 1:07:25.766
You're such a
pain in the ass.

1:07:25.801 --> 1:07:26.932
Will you just
give me the ride?

1:07:26.967 --> 1:07:28.571
Did he steal
the ashes too?

1:07:28.606 --> 1:07:29.638
No, I have them
right here.

1:07:29.673 --> 1:07:30.804
Ok, I don't understand.

1:07:30.839 --> 1:07:32.509
So, he took your truck,
but not the ashes?

1:07:32.544 --> 1:07:33.642
Yeah, that's
right, Crystal.

1:07:33.677 --> 1:07:34.841
Yeah, That doesn't
make any sense.

1:07:34.876 --> 1:07:36.513
Well, maybe he gave up.

1:07:36.548 --> 1:07:38.350
Crystal will drive you.

1:07:38.385 --> 1:07:41.188
Momma! I am... No...

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:47.689
When you get to the
border... Illinois,

1:07:47.724 --> 1:07:52.232
you have to choose
between I88 and 80.

1:07:52.894 --> 1:07:54.465
Take 80.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:55.961
You'll be thanking me later.

1:07:55.996 --> 1:07:56.863
Yes, sir.

1:07:56.898 --> 1:08:00.471
You are the
most loyal, true,

1:08:00.506 --> 1:08:03.441
faithful, committed
guy I've known.

1:08:03.476 --> 1:08:04.739
Thank you, Momma.

1:08:04.774 --> 1:08:06.246
All right.
Can we go now?

1:08:12.716 --> 1:08:15.046
HOWL: Can I tell you
something?

1:08:15.081 --> 1:08:17.257
The ashes you gave
to Momma were a decoy.

1:08:19.558 --> 1:08:20.821
It's obvious.

1:08:21.395 --> 1:08:22.361
It wasn't to your Momma.

1:08:23.397 --> 1:08:24.660
She can't find out.

1:08:24.695 --> 1:08:26.200
Tell me why and
I won't say anything.

1:08:30.602 --> 1:08:33.405
Look, it's more
of a ritual...

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.440
...to them than
anything else.

1:08:37.246 --> 1:08:39.774
And what they don't know
can't hurt them.

1:08:41.613 --> 1:08:43.250
So...

1:08:43.285 --> 1:08:44.878
I can't lose to him.

1:08:46.013 --> 1:08:46.880
Ted?

1:08:48.114 --> 1:08:49.014
You kidding me?

1:08:50.523 --> 1:08:51.621
No.

1:08:51.656 --> 1:08:52.721
So what's your plan
when you get there?

1:08:52.756 --> 1:08:53.821
Catch him.

1:08:54.428 --> 1:08:55.526
You know.

1:08:55.561 --> 1:08:56.956
Beat him up, get my
car back, go home.

1:08:56.991 --> 1:08:58.595
Has beating him up
worked for you so far?

1:08:58.630 --> 1:09:00.894
-Yes.
-He's outsmarted you every time.

1:09:02.535 --> 1:09:04.304
You gotta have
fox to fox.

1:09:05.802 --> 1:09:09.001
You have to beat him
at his own game, Howl.

1:09:17.418 --> 1:09:19.352
So we're about two hours.

1:09:19.387 --> 1:09:21.013
Plus traffic.

1:09:21.048 --> 1:09:22.916
Plus Chicago traffic,
four hours.

1:09:23.886 --> 1:09:24.951
But we're close.

1:09:25.987 --> 1:09:27.195
We're really close.

1:09:31.267 --> 1:09:32.200
TED: Jesus Christ!

1:09:33.027 --> 1:09:34.301
You scared the
shit out of me.

1:09:36.063 --> 1:09:36.963
What?

1:09:36.998 --> 1:09:38.932
What are you doing back?

1:09:48.075 --> 1:09:49.008
Ted.

1:09:50.044 --> 1:09:51.813
Did you lose
my ashes again?

1:09:51.848 --> 1:09:54.915
No, no, look,
you're right here.

1:09:54.950 --> 1:09:57.016
I did everything that
you told me to do.

1:09:57.854 --> 1:09:59.051
LAURA: Where are we?

1:09:59.086 --> 1:10:01.889
We're in Illinois.
Right here.

1:10:01.924 --> 1:10:05.596
Which is like two, well,
four hours to Chicago.

1:10:05.631 --> 1:10:06.861
Field Museum.

1:10:06.896 --> 1:10:08.368
LAURA: Right.

1:10:08.403 --> 1:10:11.371
I'm gonna... I'm gonna scatter
you where we were the happiest.

1:10:14.871 --> 1:10:16.134
Why am I back?

1:10:17.577 --> 1:10:18.576
I don't know.

1:10:23.649 --> 1:10:25.077
I can't do this anymore.

1:10:27.213 --> 1:10:28.883
What... Then...

1:10:29.490 --> 1:10:30.423
Let's get going.

1:10:31.558 --> 1:10:32.425
Great.

1:10:33.791 --> 1:10:34.856
Okay.

1:11:14.128 --> 1:11:16.271
Do you know what
sacred means?

1:11:16.933 --> 1:11:18.372
GIRL: Special?

1:11:18.407 --> 1:11:20.099
Special?

1:11:20.134 --> 1:11:26.413
Sacrosanct, to be venerated,
inviolable, untouchable.

1:11:28.010 --> 1:11:31.517
What prompted you to disturb
that which is more special?

1:11:33.686 --> 1:11:36.357
It was an accident.

1:11:36.392 --> 1:11:37.325
MAN: Give it.

1:11:40.495 --> 1:11:44.365
You are banned from
the field museum for life.

1:11:53.002 --> 1:11:54.342
You believe this crap.

1:12:29.742 --> 1:12:30.972
This is it.

1:12:32.679 --> 1:12:34.041
Ted.

1:12:35.517 --> 1:12:36.648
Mr. Daniels.

1:12:37.178 --> 1:12:38.144
Huh?

1:12:38.179 --> 1:12:40.553
I am Steven Lesca.
The head of security here.

1:12:40.588 --> 1:12:41.917
I just met your friend Howl.

1:12:41.952 --> 1:12:43.424
What? No!

1:12:43.459 --> 1:12:45.657
-It's not even his real name.
-That's not even his real name.

1:12:45.956 --> 1:12:46.889
Sorry.

1:12:46.924 --> 1:12:48.594
Howl. It's a
stupid nickname.

1:12:48.629 --> 1:12:49.595
His real name's Tracy.

1:12:50.598 --> 1:12:52.059
Always better, I suppose.

1:12:52.094 --> 1:12:53.764
Yeah, and he's
not my friend.

1:12:53.799 --> 1:12:55.029
I'm sorry about that.

1:12:56.098 --> 1:12:57.636
What brings you
to the Field today?

1:12:58.870 --> 1:12:59.770
The art.

1:12:59.805 --> 1:13:00.771
The... The art.

1:13:00.806 --> 1:13:02.300
-The art?
-The art.

1:13:02.335 --> 1:13:03.037
The art.

1:13:03.072 --> 1:13:04.775
-Art.
-Really? Art?

1:13:04.810 --> 1:13:07.745
I'm here to admire
and observe the art.

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:09.516
That's not what
Howl told us.

1:13:09.551 --> 1:13:14.147
Yeah, well, his
name's a verb, so...

1:13:20.463 --> 1:13:23.893
STEVEN: Nothing happens in this
museum that I cannot see.

1:13:23.928 --> 1:13:26.357
And I'm looking at
your face right now.

1:13:26.392 --> 1:13:28.436
Am I doing something
weird with my face?

1:13:28.471 --> 1:13:29.668
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1:13:29.703 --> 1:13:31.769
Look, it's a touching story

1:13:31.804 --> 1:13:33.199
and I know you've
come a long way.

1:13:34.103 --> 1:13:35.234
Don't do it

1:13:38.008 --> 1:13:40.646
All right. It's all set.

1:13:41.913 --> 1:13:44.342
Thanks for the ride.
And you know the advice.

1:13:45.917 --> 1:13:47.851
Sure you don't need
me to stick around?

1:13:47.886 --> 1:13:50.557
Nah, all I need
are my keys back.

1:13:50.592 --> 1:13:53.758
You know, beat him up.
Should be a cinch.

1:14:12.042 --> 1:14:13.173
What happened?

1:14:14.275 --> 1:14:16.176
Can you see anything?

1:14:16.552 --> 1:14:17.485
Ted.

1:14:18.114 --> 1:14:20.587
I'm not magical.

1:14:22.118 --> 1:14:23.623
Howl is here.

1:14:23.658 --> 1:14:24.822
Oh, you're not magical, huh?

1:14:25.726 --> 1:14:26.692
Then how can you tell if--

1:14:26.727 --> 1:14:27.693
HOWL: Hey, Loser.

1:14:28.597 --> 1:14:29.992
Where's my truck?

1:14:30.027 --> 1:14:31.290
Hey, what's your deal, man?

1:14:31.325 --> 1:14:33.193
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

1:14:33.228 --> 1:14:36.064
when you realised
I beat you.

1:14:38.805 --> 1:14:41.806
Worth it. Totally worth it.

1:14:43.007 --> 1:14:44.512
I out foxed the fox.

1:14:44.547 --> 1:14:45.337
You are the fox.

1:14:45.372 --> 1:14:47.141
Yeah. And what
does that make you?

1:14:47.176 --> 1:14:48.846
A better fox.

1:14:48.881 --> 1:14:51.376
Give me my truck
back and we're even.

1:14:51.411 --> 1:14:54.214
You have an unbelievably
screwed up concept of even.

1:14:54.249 --> 1:14:57.415
Your monument was a joke.

1:14:57.450 --> 1:15:00.154
Didn't she say you couldn't
stand for what you believe in?

1:15:00.189 --> 1:15:02.354
Came all the way to
Chicago for what?

1:15:02.389 --> 1:15:03.322
Nothing.

1:15:15.303 --> 1:15:19.745
Wow, no one crosses
Ted Daniels, I guess.

1:15:19.780 --> 1:15:21.846
Hey, don't make fun.

1:15:21.881 --> 1:15:23.144
I feel bad enough as it is.

1:15:23.179 --> 1:15:26.114
Oh, well, if it makes
you feel any better,

1:15:26.149 --> 1:15:28.721
I think that the bouncy
ball did most of the work.

1:15:41.736 --> 1:15:43.296
The path is clear now.

1:15:44.805 --> 1:15:46.431
We just have to...

1:15:46.466 --> 1:15:50.138
...outsmart the impenetrable
security at the Field Museum.

1:15:50.877 --> 1:15:52.778
No one crosses
Ted Daniels.

1:15:54.914 --> 1:15:57.882
TED: We know their security
cameras everywhere, right?

1:15:59.281 --> 1:16:00.885
Maybe it's not meant to be.

1:16:02.119 --> 1:16:04.152
TED: No, no, it has to be.

1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:05.923
We've come this far.

1:16:10.028 --> 1:16:13.293
No one crosses Ned Taniels.

1:16:14.703 --> 1:16:16.395
Who is that?

1:16:16.430 --> 1:16:18.738
Guy I made up... right now.

1:16:20.038 --> 1:16:23.303
Well, whatever you're gonna do,
we should do it fast.

1:16:23.338 --> 1:16:25.338
I'm fading pretty quick here.

1:17:48.929 --> 1:17:50.390
We could do it here.

1:17:51.965 --> 1:17:52.931
Yeah.

1:17:56.904 --> 1:17:57.936
BUt, we're not going to.

1:18:00.303 --> 1:18:02.710
You always knew
where we were happiest.

1:18:03.911 --> 1:18:07.044
It was never about tombs,
or gods, or monuments.

1:18:08.410 --> 1:18:10.817
Happiness for us
was uncomplicated.

1:18:12.150 --> 1:18:13.083
Let's go home.

1:18:18.222 --> 1:18:19.353
This guy?

1:18:20.257 --> 1:18:21.157
TED: I have to go.

1:18:21.192 --> 1:18:22.158
No, you need to leave.

1:18:22.193 --> 1:18:23.929
TED: Yeah. Look, I'm trying to.

1:18:23.964 --> 1:18:25.997
Look, you were right.
I was going to scatter her...

1:18:26.032 --> 1:18:26.734
Yeah, I knew that.

1:18:26.769 --> 1:18:27.966
Yeah, but I'm not going to now.

1:18:28.001 --> 1:18:28.901
I know that too.

1:18:28.936 --> 1:18:30.595
Because I decided not to.

1:18:31.235 --> 1:18:32.102
Wait a minute.

1:18:33.270 --> 1:18:34.874
So you're leaving?

1:18:34.909 --> 1:18:36.810
Yes, if you let me.

1:18:37.604 --> 1:18:38.779
Thank you.

1:18:38.814 --> 1:18:40.506
Fine. Wonderful.

1:18:40.541 --> 1:18:43.113
Actually, uh, I'm sorry.

1:18:44.050 --> 1:18:45.786
Can we do one thing first?

1:19:26.785 --> 1:19:27.718
TED: Oh!

1:19:38.401 --> 1:19:39.532
Now, I'll leave.

1:19:46.805 --> 1:19:48.739
Oh, you're awake?

1:19:53.152 --> 1:19:54.646
They discharging you soon?

1:20:00.786 --> 1:20:01.719
Huh.

1:20:02.227 --> 1:20:03.127
You feeling better?

1:20:09.069 --> 1:20:11.036
Mmm. Can I get you anything?

1:20:11.467 --> 1:20:12.598
You hungry or?

1:20:15.273 --> 1:20:17.438
There's a
vending machine right...

1:20:17.803 --> 1:20:18.703
Oh, here.

1:20:33.225 --> 1:20:35.555
You know, I kind of like
you not being able to talk.

1:20:36.492 --> 1:20:38.030
You know, you've been
a real asshole

1:20:38.065 --> 1:20:39.559
for a really long time.

1:20:39.594 --> 1:20:42.463
I think you do it because
you're trying to protect
yourself or something.

1:20:42.498 --> 1:20:43.827
And that's okay.

1:20:43.862 --> 1:20:48.975
I think somewhere in there
you're a good person.

1:20:49.010 --> 1:20:51.846
Just don't be
a prick all the time

1:20:57.480 --> 1:21:00.250
I came to let you know
I'm spreading Laura's ashes
in Colorado.

1:21:21.405 --> 1:21:22.536
TED: Yep.

1:21:32.779 --> 1:21:34.647
TED: In Egyptian mythology,

1:21:35.419 --> 1:21:37.254
when you die,

1:21:37.289 --> 1:21:41.093
Anubis weighs your heart
against this feather of truth.

1:21:42.393 --> 1:21:44.558
Ideally, you know your heart,

1:21:44.593 --> 1:21:46.197
you kind of want, even.

1:21:46.232 --> 1:21:48.331
Because if it's too heavy,
if it's too light,

1:21:48.366 --> 1:21:52.467
then this terrible monster
named Ammit comes and then
he just like, argh...

1:21:52.502 --> 1:21:54.700
He just, like, swallows
your heart and,

1:21:54.735 --> 1:21:56.801
pretty much doomed to oblivion.

1:21:57.837 --> 1:22:02.279
The idea is, in the end,
you want to be even.

1:22:03.612 --> 1:22:06.547
And evenness allows you
to pass to the underworld.

1:22:15.327 --> 1:22:18.922
Well, because
if we die tomorrow,

1:22:18.957 --> 1:22:22.035
I wouldn't want to know
that we weren't even.

1:22:24.171 --> 1:22:25.203
Why are we doing this?

1:22:25.238 --> 1:22:26.336
I just want to be even.

1:22:40.715 --> 1:22:43.023
TED: No, it's not a trick.

1:22:44.356 --> 1:22:48.358
But, I do want to steal
that truck of yours
one more time.

1:25:11.965 --> 1:25:13.866
TED: This is where
we were happiest.

1:25:15.804 --> 1:25:18.211
LAURA: When we were doing
absolutely nothing.

1:25:20.578 --> 1:25:24.151
TED: I'm sorry that
I had to drive
cross country to realize that.

1:25:25.616 --> 1:25:27.286
You just like
to get into trouble.

1:25:27.321 --> 1:25:29.112
Yeah.

1:25:29.147 --> 1:25:31.224
Because I know that
you won't give me out.

1:25:33.052 --> 1:25:33.985
Yeah.

1:25:39.762 --> 1:25:41.267
What am I going to do
without you?

1:25:42.402 --> 1:25:43.335
You're going to be all right.

1:25:50.344 --> 1:25:51.706
Yeah.

1:25:51.741 --> 1:25:53.378
Yeah, yeah, I will.

1:25:57.417 --> 1:25:59.252
I loved every moment with you.

1:26:01.146 --> 1:26:04.554
I loved being able to be
your partner.

1:26:06.052 --> 1:26:08.195
I love that you
let me be your partner.

1:26:12.399 --> 1:26:14.025
I love you, so much.

1:26:15.435 --> 1:26:16.533
I love you, too.

1:26:23.311 --> 1:26:24.211
Goodbye, Laura.
