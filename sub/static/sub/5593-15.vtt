that everything was okay,

and I'm -- I am --
I am really sorry.

Okay?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.379
I'm sorry.

39:46.174 --> 39:48.006
You wanted to wait
until it was too late?

39:49.558 --> 39:52.931
Right? Until you were too far
along to do anything about it.

39:52.931 --> 39:55.774
I'm sorry.
Do what, exactly?

39:55.774 --> 39:57.976
I don't know --
not put us through this again,

39:57.976 --> 39:59.608
or a baby,
for that matter.

39:59.608 --> 40:01.820
I mean, I'd have to hold him
while he dies.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.111
Maybe have some options.

40:03.111 --> 40:06.695
Um, that is not an option for me
and you know that.

What about me?

40:07.946 --> 40:09.448
Hmm?

40:15.624 --> 40:17.165
Yes, you are. Yes.

You're the father

40:19.127 --> 40:21.840
But right now,
you have no choice in this.

We don't want to see
what's underneath.

40:43.692 --> 40:47.616
But maybe it's not the fear
of the pain that holds us back.

40:47.616 --> 40:50.739
I was worried about the duodenal
segment getting ischemic.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.661
Mm.
Yeah, what'd you do?

40:52.661 --> 40:56.955
Mm. I placed stents at the SMA
and the celiac anastomoses,

40:56.955 --> 40:58.537
just to be
on the safe side.

good guy, had no idea
he drank a fifth a day

41:11.970 --> 41:14.142

into his liver.

I used an interposition
aortic conduit
