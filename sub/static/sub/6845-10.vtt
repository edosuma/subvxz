Can we please try and
shoo the toddlers away

00:03.051 --> 00:04.684
from the sunglasses stand?

00:04.719 --> 00:06.519
I know that's where they all like to go,

00:06.554 --> 00:08.821
but we're getting a lot of damage there.

00:08.857 --> 00:11.057
Also from the lower yogurts.

00:11.092 --> 00:13.693
They tend to just want
to put their fingers in.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.238
Something going on with you and Dina?

00:16.338 --> 00:19.205
No. What? No.

00:19.241 --> 00:20.507
I don't know, man, you guys are exchanging

00:20.542 --> 00:21.775
little peek-a-boo glances,

00:21.810 --> 00:23.943
and it's making me uncomfortable.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.245
Okay. The other night,

00:25.280 --> 00:26.980
when we were all locked in the store,

00:27.015 --> 00:29.315
Dina kind of... came on to me.

00:29.351 --> 00:30.784
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?

00:30.819 --> 00:33.653
I didn't know Dina was into fancy
little porcelain doll-men.

00:33.688 --> 00:36.856
So, while we haven't caught the raccoon yet,

00:36.892 --> 00:40.427
I do feel that we're starting
to have a better understanding

00:40.462 --> 00:42.429
of his patterns.

00:42.464 --> 00:43.663
So, you tap that?

00:43.698 --> 00:45.198
No, I felt bad.

00:45.233 --> 00:48.301
And I told her that I wasn't comfortable

00:48.336 --> 00:49.903
dating a supervisor,

00:49.938 --> 00:52.739
and she was cool with it.

00:52.774 --> 00:54.174
Quick thinking.

00:54.209 --> 00:58.344
Moving on, one final
announcement from Dina.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.080
[clears throat] Effective immediately,

01:01.116 --> 01:02.549
I will be stepping down from my position

01:02.584 --> 01:05.117
of assistant manager to associate level

01:05.153 --> 01:09.722
so that I may concentrate
on... personal matters.

01:09.758 --> 01:11.191
Well, I think I speak for everyone

01:11.226 --> 01:13.359
when I say that's really, really sad.

01:13.395 --> 01:14.994
I know that I'm gonna miss

01:15.030 --> 01:17.063
your constant criticism of me a lot.

01:17.098 --> 01:18.398
I'm gonna miss that too.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.567
Sure there's nothing we
can say to make you stay?

01:20.602 --> 01:21.568
Well, you know, there's always...

01:21.603 --> 01:23.536
Oh, too bad, so sad.

01:23.572 --> 01:25.104
Well, let's have an extra fun chant.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.573
Come on, give me a C!

01:26.608 --> 01:27.574
All: C!

01:35.088 --> 01:37.389
I can't believe she's stepping down.

01:37.424 --> 01:41.059
Hmm. I wonder what her
personal matters could be.

01:41.094 --> 01:42.928
Hey, Jonah. You got any ideas?

01:42.963 --> 01:45.430
Me? No, I don't... Mm-mm.

01:45.465 --> 01:47.199
Are her birds okay?

01:47.234 --> 01:49.601
Has anybody checked the live webcam?

01:49.636 --> 01:52.604
Maybe she has gambling debts
and she had to take time off

01:52.639 --> 01:56.208
to do favors for the mob
boss that she owes money to.

01:56.243 --> 01:59.978
[gasps] Or maybe it's something else.

02:00.013 --> 02:02.180
No, I wonder who's gonna replace her.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.910
A lot of people have been
suggesting it should be me.

02:04.945 --> 02:06.011
Kind of a groundswell.

02:06.046 --> 02:07.579
You know, she did mention a few weeks ago

02:07.615 --> 02:09.314
that her grandmother was sick.

02:09.348 --> 02:11.983
Oh, that's great!

02:12.019 --> 02:15.053
No, I didn't mean... No, it's, uh...

02:15.089 --> 02:17.022
I was just saying, you know,
like, if I get that age,

I know. Look, I really
appreciate the offer, I do.

for the same amount of money.

04:00.494 --> 04:02.194
"Hey, have you been on vacation?"

04:02.229 --> 04:04.663
and I'll be like, "Nah,
I was here the whole time."

04:04.697 --> 04:07.465
I love how you observe things.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.201
Yeah. Listen, Dina, the...

04:10.236 --> 04:11.969
- Do you like risotto?
- Huh?

04:12.005 --> 04:13.204
I make a nice risotto. I was thinking

04:13.240 --> 04:14.640
if you wanted to come over later tonight,

04:14.682 --> 04:15.858
I could make us some.

04:15.858 --> 04:18.358
And I have "Hoosiers" on Blu-ray.

04:18.392 --> 04:22.128
Well, that sounds like a great evening.

04:22.164 --> 04:25.031
Yeah. Gene Hackman, so...

04:25.067 --> 04:29.341
Right. Dina, do you think
this is really a good idea?

04:29.451 --> 04:32.285
You know, the whole
giving up your job thing?

04:32.321 --> 04:33.553
Oh, quitting that job

04:33.589 --> 04:35.155
was the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

04:35.190 --> 04:36.690
- It was?
- Heck, yeah.

04:36.725 --> 04:38.925
I was getting a stress rash in

04:38.961 --> 04:39.993
But now it's disappearing.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.162

I mean, you're gonna see it soon enough.

04:46.201 --> 04:48.902
Um...

04:48.937 --> 04:50.437
But...

04:50.472 --> 04:52.039
I needed a change, honestly.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.541
Ever since my Nana died,
I've just been in such a rut.

04:54.576 --> 04:57.878
Oh, no, I'm s... I didn't... I'm so sorry.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.346
Yeah, sweet lady.

04:59.381 --> 05:01.048
But it was probably for the best, though.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.449
- I'm sure.
- I mean, she would not

05:02.484 --> 05:04.451
have been cool with the whole...

05:08.490 --> 05:10.924
Uh, the relationship [clears throat]

05:10.959 --> 05:12.559
Is something that we should talk about.

05:12.594 --> 05:14.828
Yeah. You know, I'm not
normally an insecure person,

05:14.863 --> 05:16.863
but now that it's all out in
the open, I gotta tell you,

05:16.899 --> 05:18.899
there was a couple of
times where I thought,

05:18.934 --> 05:21.401
"Am I being delusional?"
"Does he even like me?"

05:21.437 --> 05:23.236
"Like, I think he does." [laughs]

05:23.272 --> 05:27.040
Or is he just stringing me
along like some sociopath?"

05:27.076 --> 05:30.544
[forced laugh] Yeah, no.

05:30.579 --> 05:33.213
Nope, nope, that's not
me. I'm not a psychopath.

05:33.248 --> 05:34.981
- Sociopath.
- What's even the difference?

05:35.017 --> 05:36.349
A psychopath doesn't have a conscience.

05:36.385 --> 05:37.718
A sociopath knows what he's doing is wrong

05:37.753 --> 05:39.286
but does it anyway.

05:39.321 --> 05:40.670
8:00 tonight?

05:41.824 --> 05:43.023
I can't say no.

05:43.047 --> 05:44.504

05:48.969 --> 05:50.869

05:51.124 --> 05:54.842
So I realized the answer to
our assistant manager problem

05:54.937 --> 05:58.839
has been right in front
of us, literally forever.

06:00.141 --> 06:02.175
You're gonna promote Myrtle?

06:02.210 --> 06:04.344
I decided to promote based on seniority,

06:04.380 --> 06:06.613
and she has both kinds.

06:06.649 --> 06:09.183
Plus, she has leadership experience.

06:09.218 --> 06:10.517
She was head switchboard operator

06:10.553 --> 06:12.987
for the Pall Mall cigarette company.

06:13.021 --> 06:15.321
Uh, yeah, but...

06:15.358 --> 06:18.025
maybe you should interview
some other people first.

06:18.059 --> 06:20.126
Well, I'm not very good with interviews.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.529
I like just about everybody I meet.

06:22.565 --> 06:24.565
I have virtually no standards.

06:24.599 --> 06:27.934
Okay, well, I could help you find someone.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.637
That is, if you haven't
already offered Myrtle the job.

06:30.672 --> 06:31.838
No...

06:31.874 --> 06:34.475
Well, I did, but I
don't think she heard me.

06:36.544 --> 06:40.213
Whoo! Ooh! Aah! [laughs]

06:40.248 --> 06:42.415
So, instead of just telling
her you were not interested,

06:42.451 --> 06:45.185
you said you would go to
her house to eat risotto

06:45.221 --> 06:47.121
and watch Gene Hackman
inspire a small town?

06:47.155 --> 06:49.288

06:58.166 --> 06:59.766
Yeah, and you're totally
unique in that way.

06:59.802 --> 07:02.870
You need to toughen up.
All right, see this dude?

07:02.905 --> 07:05.072
Whatever I ask you, the answer is no.

07:05.106 --> 07:06.172
What?

07:06.207 --> 07:08.975
- I need to return this blender.
- Oh, okay.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.412
Well, it looks like you've got the receipt,

07:11.447 --> 07:12.913
It has not been opened,

07:12.948 --> 07:15.282
and you purchased it within 14 days.

07:15.317 --> 07:18.485
Can I give him a refund?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.053
Sorry, no refunds.

07:20.088 --> 07:21.721
What do you mean? Why not?

07:21.756 --> 07:24.590
Yeah, it seems like a pretty valid return.

07:25.693 --> 07:29.195
I do not have a good answer for that.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.863
So...

07:30.899 --> 07:32.265
Why don't we give him store credit?

07:32.300 --> 07:34.834
- Would that work for you?
- Yeah, that's fine.

07:36.404 --> 07:38.538
No store credit.

07:38.573 --> 07:40.206

07:50.485 --> 07:51.851
So what was the point of that?

07:51.886 --> 07:54.320
I don't know. I'm bored.

07:54.355 --> 07:57.657
All right, ma'am. I
cannot stress this enough.

to take over anything

Nope. I'm fine. Learning on the job.

Her eyes are so pretty, though.

what if you don't do any eyeliner at all?

away from that chin.

strap you into this chair?

Are we being Plunked?

09:23.247 --> 09:24.412
Just...

09:24.448 --> 09:27.215
Truth is, I need a break.

09:27.251 --> 09:29.918
Have you ever held a
dying man's hand in yours

09:29.953 --> 09:31.319
while you had to tell him

09:31.355 --> 09:34.222
that we don't accept rewards
points for his medication?

09:34.258 --> 09:36.591
He literally died while
I was holding his hand.

09:36.627 --> 09:37.993
I don't think that's true.

09:38.028 --> 09:39.895
Well, I guess we'll never know.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.164
I got to say, Sandra, I am impressed.

09:42.199 --> 09:45.033
I did not expect you to
be interested in this job,

09:45.068 --> 09:47.536
but way to go, showing initiative.

09:47.571 --> 09:48.670
[gasps]

09:48.705 --> 09:49.938
Oh.

09:49.973 --> 09:51.540
You're right. I'm sorry.

09:51.575 --> 09:53.508
I shouldn't have come here.

09:54.912 --> 09:56.945
Ow! Sorry.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.680
Sorry.

09:58.715 --> 10:00.815
Is this about the headphones?

10:00.851 --> 10:04.553
- What headphones?
- Oh! I don't know.

10:04.588 --> 10:06.254
I mean, I didn't take them.

10:06.290 --> 10:07.822
They probably forgot to
load them on the truck.

10:07.858 --> 10:08.924
Right.

10:08.959 --> 10:10.926
I mean, if that's what was stolen.

10:10.961 --> 10:13.161
We don't know if something was, first.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.930
That should be the first question we ask,

10:14.965 --> 10:18.867
before we make... accusations.

10:18.902 --> 10:21.703
- Is this your family?
- Oh, yeah.

10:21.738 --> 10:23.905
They're so clean.

10:23.941 --> 10:27.142
Your resume says you have a
lot of experience babysitting.

10:27.177 --> 10:31.680
Actually, it just says, "watching kids."

10:31.715 --> 10:34.149
Here's what I'm gonna need.
I'll need a 40% salary bump,

10:34.184 --> 10:36.618
access to a company car...

10:36.653 --> 10:37.819
Does the position come with stock options?

10:37.854 --> 10:38.787
- Um...
- You know what,

10:38.822 --> 10:40.055
let me answer that.

10:40.090 --> 10:43.091
The position will be
coming with stock options.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.193
When I was a teenager,

10:45.229 --> 10:48.930
I crashed my father's Hudson Super

10:48.966 --> 10:51.466
and blamed it on a Chinese.

10:51.501 --> 10:55.971
Okay, and what about your
three greatest weaknesses?

10:56.006 --> 10:57.272
If you don't believe me, then why don't you

10:57.307 --> 10:59.708
go check the tapes, okay?
Just check the tapes, man.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.843
It's all in the tapes. Check the tapes.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.945
Check the tapes. check the tapes.

11:03.981 --> 11:05.614
Yeah, all right, we will.

11:05.649 --> 11:07.649
You guys actually tape us?

11:07.684 --> 11:09.184
That's so messed up.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.993
Let me make this very easy for you.

11:18.028 --> 11:21.429
I'm gonna give you five
seconds to make a decision,

11:21.465 --> 11:24.032
and then I walk.

11:25.135 --> 11:28.336
Five... four...

11:28.372 --> 11:30.905
This one's eyes are dead,

11:30.941 --> 11:33.775
but this one's eyes are alive.

11:33.810 --> 11:36.311
- What do you call her?
- Oh, her name is...

11:36.346 --> 11:38.813
- Do not tell him her name.
- Okay.

11:38.849 --> 11:40.415
[imitates buzzer noise]
Nope... offer's off the table.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.416
You blew it.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.852
- Oh, I knew it.
- Oh, well, so sad.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.353
Thanks for coming in anyway.

11:45.389 --> 11:46.788
But it's your lucky day.

11:46.823 --> 11:48.390
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

11:48.425 --> 11:49.858
Now my demands are doubled.

11:49.893 --> 11:52.827
Okay... ten, nine... Agh!

11:55.586 --> 11:58.322
No, Mateo, your future is not here,

11:58.358 --> 11:59.824
in Manila...

11:59.859 --> 12:02.860
It lies in America.

12:05.065 --> 12:08.831
All aboard! Next stop, Ellis Island.

12:10.036 --> 12:13.438
No, Rodrigo, stand back.
You're too close to the edge.

12:13.473 --> 12:15.206
You'll fall!

12:15.241 --> 12:17.642
No, Mateo, I want to
be the first to touch...

12:17.677 --> 12:20.144
Lady Libertyyyyyyyy...

12:20.180 --> 12:23.981
Oh, my God, you were right,
Mateo... you're always right!

12:24.017 --> 12:26.217
It actually goes on for much longer.

12:26.251 --> 12:30.053
I've seen enough. I like it.

12:30.090 --> 12:31.823
You got the steak.

12:31.858 --> 12:33.591
Now it's time to make it sizzle.

12:35.227 --> 12:37.361

12:41.900 --> 12:42.866
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:42.901 --> 12:44.101
Just on my break,

12:44.137 --> 12:46.371
so I thought I'd pick up
a couple odds and ends.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.906
Cool, cool.

12:53.046 --> 12:54.879
Famous risotto.

13:00.018 --> 13:03.220
Box of chocolates... you never
know what you're gonna get.

13:08.727 --> 13:10.127
Multiple sizes.

13:10.163 --> 13:12.463
You never know what you're gonna get.

13:15.134 --> 13:17.434
I'm sorry, can you explain the order again?

13:17.469 --> 13:19.436
As you go from left to right,

13:19.472 --> 13:21.739
then each one is worse
than the one before it.

13:21.774 --> 13:23.507
- Okay.
- But,

13:23.543 --> 13:26.067
If you go from right to left,

13:26.817 --> 13:30.385
then... each one is worse
than the one before it.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.493
Maybe your standards are too high.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.964
I mean, we're a retail department store.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.433
We're not hiring the King of England here.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.002
I just don't want to hire someone

13:40.037 --> 13:42.004
who's gonna make our daily lives miserable.

13:42.936 --> 13:47.999
Amy, come have a look
out the window with me.

13:48.299 --> 13:50.065
You know, in times of crisis,

13:50.100 --> 13:53.468
good people do what
needs to be done, and...

13:54.905 --> 13:57.172
Amy! Are you leaving or just peeing?

13:57.207 --> 13:58.373

15:37.741 --> 15:40.842
There are some things that
I wanted to say to you,

15:40.878 --> 15:43.111
and I've been having
a tough time saying it,

15:43.147 --> 15:46.848
so I recorded it on my phone

15:46.884 --> 15:48.216
and I would like to play it...

15:48.252 --> 15:49.885
Hey, relax.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.689
Whatever it is, we will deal
with it together, as a couple.

15:53.724 --> 15:56.558
Okay, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna press play, okay?

- Maybe if I sort by date.
- Before you've even kissed.

16:15.479 --> 16:17.312
- Just one second.
- Maybe we should just

16:17.347 --> 16:18.780

sleeping in tiny little bursts

18:23.560 --> 18:25.026
while I'm already blinking...

18:25.028 --> 18:27.428
So, you're gonna try and do
both of these jobs yourself?

18:27.430 --> 18:29.497
- That's crazy.
- What if someone had told

18:29.499 --> 18:32.433
Ben Affleck that he
couldn't act and direct?

18:32.435 --> 18:35.904
Then we never would've had
that movie about Iran, or...

18:35.906 --> 18:37.805
Or, whatever... I'm sorry, I never saw it.

18:37.807 --> 18:38.881
- Glenn!
- What?

18:39.609 --> 18:41.776

18:41.778 --> 18:43.211
Oh, thank you!

18:43.213 --> 18:46.080

18:46.082 --> 18:47.615
Though it has dramatically increased

18:47.617 --> 18:49.951
my respect for Ben Affleck.

18:49.953 --> 18:53.154
Well, today didn't work
out exactly as I planned.

Don't bother asking for details.
It's none of your business.

18:56.293 --> 18:58.960
But I did kill it in cosmetics.

18:58.962 --> 19:00.695
Yeah, you sure did.

19:00.697 --> 19:01.930
You could improve, though.

19:17.347 --> 19:19.013

19:23.253 --> 19:25.086
No, I do, because I mean it. I mean it.

19:25.088 --> 19:27.789
You know, you're gonna
meet someone terrific,

19:27.791 --> 19:30.458
and I just hope you and I can...

19:30.460 --> 19:31.926
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, you ready?

19:31.928 --> 19:34.195
Yeah, I'm psyched. I've
never seen "Hoosiers."

19:34.197 --> 19:36.264
Oh, it'll change your life. Let's go.

19:38.301 --> 19:40.735
That was fast.

19:40.737 --> 19:43.605
Look, this doesn't have to be weird, okay?

19:43.607 --> 19:46.407
It just didn't work out. Sure, you're cute,

19:46.409 --> 19:49.611
but there's, uh... there's
a lot of cute around.

19:49.613 --> 19:50.812
See you tomorrow.

19:52.082 --> 19:55.917
Oh, hey, I should ask,
are you okay with birds?

19:55.919 --> 19:57.318
I have a lot of birds.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.121
I really appreciate it, Amy,

20:00.123 --> 20:02.123
and I know the job might be tough,

20:02.125 --> 20:03.891
but there are a lot of perks,

20:03.893 --> 20:06.661
like 5% additional discount,

20:06.663 --> 20:09.030
financial aid for continuing education,

20:09.032 --> 20:11.432
and... oh, and a
closer parking spot.

20:11.434 --> 20:12.900
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

20:12.902 --> 20:15.069
You'll be parking next to me.

20:15.071 --> 20:17.372
Open your door with caution, please.

20:17.374 --> 20:19.240
No, they help you pay for college classes?

20:19.242 --> 20:21.676
Oh, yeah, but I think only half.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.247
Half...

20:26.249 --> 20:27.548
Yes!
