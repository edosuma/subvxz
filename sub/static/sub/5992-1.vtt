00:27.682 --> 00:29.442

00:29.602 --> 00:31.282

00:31.442 --> 00:34.882
- Are they traders?
- No. They come as Vikings!

00:35.042 --> 00:36.882

01:29.882 --> 01:33.282
Uhtred. Take half a dozen men,
ride to the river.

01:33.442 --> 01:36.002
There are pagans there.
Watch them, see how many.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.882
- Of course.
- Do nothing more.

01:38.042 --> 01:40.162
(U HTRED) Yes, Father.
(GLENNA) Osbert.

01:40.322 --> 01:42.482
- What is it?
- Ships. I saw them.

01:42.642 --> 01:45.602
- What ships?
- Danes. They're heading for the river.

- We must pray.
- We must act.

01:52.002 --> 01:54.602
Uhtred. Do not fight them,
not a single one.

01:54.762 --> 01:56.282
- Be back by nightfall.
- Yes.

01:56.442 --> 01:58.922
They are sent by God to punish us
for our sins.

01:59.082 --> 02:01.802
They're here to support the Viking army
in Eoferwic.

02:01.962 --> 02:04.442
Instruct the priest
to pray for our deliverance.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.282
- Aelfric!
- Lord?

02:06.442 --> 02:09.602
- Get them inside.
- Take in the women and elders.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.842
The rest to higher ground,
out of sight.

02:12.002 --> 02:14.762

I want every man in this fortress.

03:47.922 --> 03:50.002

- Yes.

03:50.162 --> 03:52.322
What else do you see?

03:53.362 --> 03:55.162
EARL RAGNAR:
I see a clear river,

03:55.322 --> 03:56.802
fish as big as a man's leg.

03:57.162 --> 03:59.202
I see a forest alive with meat.

03:59.362 --> 04:01.962
More than that,
I see a place to grow fat and old.

04:52.202 --> 04:54.802
(LORD UHTRED) Why do I leave
the villages unprotected

04:54.962 --> 04:56.282
and bring the men inside?

04:56.442 --> 04:58.482
Is that your question?

04:58.642 --> 05:02.162
A village can be rebuilt,
a warrior can die only once.

05:02.322 --> 05:04.802
The Danes may be heading south
to Eofervvic,

05:04.962 --> 05:08.002
but they will kill
whoever they can on the way.

05:09.082 --> 05:10.802
Now, go and find the priest.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.802
(OSBERT) Yes, Father.

(BEOCCA) Come in, Osbert,
don't skulk in the shadows.

05:24.042 --> 05:26.042
(OSBERT)
He wants to know if you're ready.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.962
(BEOCCA) Almost.

05:28.322 --> 05:30.562
Do you know what I'm tasked with?

05:30.722 --> 05:34.482
- Urn, a letter?
- A response to a letter, this letter

05:34.642 --> 05:36.402
from King Aella.

05:36.642 --> 05:39.882
Asking your father for his support,
his army,

05:40.042 --> 05:43.122
to help recapture
the city of Eofervvic.

05:43.282 --> 05:45.602
This is why it's important
to read and write.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.242
Father can't read nor write.

05:47.402 --> 05:49.562
Yeah, well,
for your father it's too late.

05:49.722 --> 05:52.122
King Aella could have sent
a man on horseback.

05:52.282 --> 05:54.922
Who's to say the man on horseback
speaks the truth?

05:55.082 --> 05:57.522
Or has remembered
the true message?

05:58.202 --> 06:02.202
What these letters will represent
is history, facts.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.482
Your father is informing King Aella
and King Osbert

06:05.642 --> 06:08.882
he will be alongside their armies
at Eofervvic.

06:09.042 --> 06:12.722
And the mark of Bebbanburg
will guarantee the truth of it.

06:12.882 --> 06:14.482
Why do we fight for Eoferwic?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.482
Well, we fight for Eoferwic

06:16.642 --> 06:20.962
because we do not wish to see England,
piece by piece, become Daneland.

06:21.122 --> 06:24.722
Heh, heh. I heard it said
that we were pagans once,

06:24.882 --> 06:27.602
that Woden and Odin are the same.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.082
We saw the error of our ways,
looked to Rome.

06:30.242 --> 06:32.642
I heard the pagans
had fierce gods of war.

06:32.802 --> 06:34.962
Well, we are right
and they are mistaken.

06:35.122 --> 06:37.282
Osbert, we are blessed.

06:37.442 --> 06:39.762
I should make you swear
on St Cuthbert's comb

06:39.922 --> 06:42.082
never to mention
the likes of Woden again.

06:42.242 --> 06:44.922
But what if I had a hound
called Woden?

06:45.082 --> 06:48.682
- What would you do then?
- What if you had a pig called Thor?

06:48.842 --> 06:51.642
- Come. Let's go see your father.
- A pig called Thor.

06:51.802 --> 06:55.722
- Is it really St Cuthbert's comb?
- Of course it's St Cuthbert's comb,

06:55.882 --> 06:58.722
and his holy hair
lies in the teeth of that comb.

06:58.882 --> 07:02.362
- Where was your father last?
- He was humping the servant girl.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.162
- That's a lie, Osbert.
- No.

07:04.322 --> 07:07.642
- Are you never gonna tire of teasing?
- Nope.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.522

I spoke to him.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.402
You told him to watch and do not fight.
We have...

08:31.562 --> 08:33.322
Do not fight means do not fight.

08:33.482 --> 08:36.202
- He was young.
(LORD UHTRED) No fight until Eoferwic.

08:36.361 --> 08:38.922

You wanted to see Osbert, my lord.

08:39.402 --> 08:40.962
You.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.482
You are now called Uhtred.

08:42.642 --> 08:45.442
Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
You have your stone, the amber?

08:45.602 --> 08:47.962
- Yes.
- The priest will show you your history,

08:48.162 --> 08:50.682
- parchments. Make him understand.
(BEOCCA) Lord, I...

08:50.842 --> 08:52.842
I should like to baptise him again.

08:53.002 --> 08:55.162
If he arrives at heaven's gate
as Uhtred,

08:55.322 --> 08:57.842
they might wonder
what's happened to Osbert.

08:58.002 --> 09:00.282
Do what you must, but do as I ask.

09:00.442 --> 09:01.922

09:02.762 --> 09:06.522
We were kings here once, boy.
Kings of all the lands

09:06.682 --> 09:09.802
- between rivers Tuede and Tine.
- We should be kings again.

09:09.962 --> 09:13.802
We should, but it does not matter
what they call us so long as they obey.

09:13.962 --> 09:16.602
Our ancestors took this land.

09:16.762 --> 09:19.202
It's been strengthened
with our blood and bone.

09:19.362 --> 09:23.242
And now you are the new heir
of Bebbanburg. You hear me?

09:23.402 --> 09:25.202
And you will die for it if needed.

09:25.362 --> 09:28.282
And l'll give you the head of the man
who killed Uhtred.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.122
No, you are Uhtred!

09:30.282 --> 09:32.242
Have you not been listening to me?

09:32.402 --> 09:35.802
Do not tell me what it is you will do,
you are just a pup.

09:35.962 --> 09:40.402
You will give me nothing.
You will watch and you will learn.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.682
Put him in the water before
his mother's tongue gives me grief.

09:45.842 --> 09:47.802
She's not my mother.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.642
Will you take him with you to battle
to watch and learn?

09:52.802 --> 09:55.962
I need you to choose 3O men
and remain here at Bebbanburg.

09:56.122 --> 09:58.842
Protect the boy. He is the heir.

10:00.202 --> 10:02.962

An amulet. Thor's hammer.

You're Christian.

You should go to Wessex.

39:40.202 --> 39:43.682
He... He asked
if you were treating me well.

40:02.802 --> 40:04.442
(AELFRIC) How much?
(RAVN) Three hundred.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.082
(AELFRIC) That is a ridiculous amount.

40:06.242 --> 40:08.562
How can a boy be worth
300 pieces of silver?

40:08.722 --> 40:14.082
Because I say so,
because he is a lord and an ealdorman.

40:14.242 --> 40:15.602
No, he is a boy.

40:15.762 --> 40:19.202
I am the ealdorman of Bebbanburg.
I carry the seal and banner.

40:19.362 --> 40:21.962
That seal is my father's,
which is now mine.

40:22.122 --> 40:25.482
You be silent.
You are for sale, nothing more.

40:25.642 --> 40:27.762
- For ransom, lord.
- That's what I said.

40:27.922 --> 40:31.002
My lords,
I have given up land, horses.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.242
I've offered a generous supply of food
as well as my sword.

40:34.402 --> 40:37.802
All I ask in return
is a fair price for my only nephew.

40:37.962 --> 40:40.762
(RAVN)
What would you say is a fair price?

40:40.922 --> 40:44.042
- I'll offer a hundred pieces of silver.
- (RAVN) Two hundred.

40:44.202 --> 40:48.482
My allegiance and 100 pieces
is surely a fair price.

40:48.642 --> 40:50.962
(RAVN) It is not.

40:51.922 --> 40:55.362
I will give 120 pieces of silver
for the boy.

40:55.522 --> 40:57.802

52:50.842 --> 52:53.642
- I see him with Kjartan.
- (KJARTAN) Burn it to the ground.

52:53.802 --> 52:55.562
(BRIDA) Maybe they're in it together.

52:55.722 --> 52:58.762
And what makes them believe
they can do this without punishment?

52:59.002 --> 53:02.202
Shh. They will be punished,
but not by you.

53:02.362 --> 53:04.922
Uhtred, listen to me,
we serve Ragnar best alive.

53:05.082 --> 53:07.322
We tell the story.

53:08.282 --> 53:10.722
- I need to kill someone.
- No.

53:10.882 --> 53:13.002
And I choose him.

53:15.042 --> 53:16.362
Uhtred, no.

53:17.842 --> 53:19.522
(KJARTAN) Come on!

53:24.762 --> 53:26.082
(SIGHS)

53:29.762 --> 53:31.442
(KJARTAN LAUGHING)

53:34.882 --> 53:38.042
(KJARTAN) The main thing
is to keep the horses together here.

53:39.002 --> 53:40.882
Don't leave any weapons behind.

53:42.082 --> 53:45.002
Move those over
and we'll look in the back.

53:45.162 --> 53:48.242
Don't leave anything in there.
Just bring it all out.

53:58.842 --> 54:00.682
(KJARTAN) A little bit more.

54:14.722 --> 54:16.882
(KJARTAN) Yeah.
(MAN) Over here!

54:17.682 --> 54:19.282
(KJARTAN) Hey, come on.

54:19.602 --> 54:21.522
(GRUNTING)

54:26.922 --> 54:29.842
Yeah. You know who I am?

54:30.002 --> 54:31.642
It's me you're looking for.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.482
It's me you're looking for.

54:33.642 --> 54:36.362
You remember me?
You remember me?

54:36.522 --> 54:38.282
(SCALLION GRUNTING)

54:38.442 --> 54:39.762
(BODY THUMPS)

54:43.002 --> 54:44.842
(PANTING)

54:58.482 --> 55:00.122
There's no more.

55:00.282 --> 55:01.602
- We're going.
- (SVEN) Come on.

55:02.322 --> 55:04.402
(KJARTAN) Bring the horses.

55:20.802 --> 55:23.442
(sesame)

55:49.522 --> 55:51.002
(GRUNTING)

56:11.562 --> 56:14.482
By right it belongs to young Ragnar.

56:14.882 --> 56:18.522
Yes. But we spend what we need
to spend. We stay alive.

56:18.682 --> 56:21.402
We tell the story and then what?

56:24.562 --> 56:27.002
We find a new lord to serve.

56:32.082 --> 56:36.122
I will not stand by and have
everything that's mine taken from me.

56:38.202 --> 56:40.002
I'm going back.

56:40.162 --> 56:41.762
Where?

56:43.962 --> 56:46.042
To the beginning.

57:32.562 --> 57:36.122
(HORN BLOWING)

57:47.842 --> 57:49.802
- (AELFRIC) ls it Scallion?
- No, my lord.

57:49.962 --> 57:53.682
- He looks like a Dane.
- Could be one of Kjartan's men.

58:16.202 --> 58:19.002
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I shall take what is mine!

58:21.642 --> 58:23.562
Bebbanburg's mine!

58:25.362 --> 58:27.282
Horses.
