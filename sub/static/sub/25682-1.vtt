01:14.003 --> 01:18.362
<i>For most of the past year, I have
been German businessman Hans Hoffman.</i>

01:20.042 --> 01:23.360
<i>My real name is Ari Ben-Sion.</i>

01:26.548 --> 01:28.837
<i>Lying to everyone is difficult...</i>

01:28.917 --> 01:32.674
<i>...but my life depends on keeping
the two worlds separate.</i>

01:40.061 --> 01:44.120
<i>If I could, I would be
Hans Hoffman all the time.</i>

01:46.734 --> 01:48.527
- Hans Hoffman.
- <i>We found him.</i>

01:48.607 --> 01:51.225
<i>He's at the Avalon Hotel. We're a go.</i>

01:51.305 --> 01:52.823
Okay.

01:54.431 --> 01:58.533
<i>One of our agents has been passing
top secret information to the Syrians.</i>

01:58.613 --> 02:03.072
<i>My partner and I have been assigned to
bring him back to Israel for interrogation.</i>

02:23.003 --> 02:25.260
- <i>You are compromised?</i>
- Yes.

02:25.340 --> 02:28.180
<i>Don't worry, I will get you to Syria.</i>

02:28.260 --> 02:31.261
If my people find me, I am dead.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.634
<i>Trust me, my friend.</i>

02:33.714 --> 02:36.005
<i>Did you find who I'm looking for?</i>

02:38.184 --> 02:41.544
All I know is his code name.

02:44.491 --> 02:46.814
We call him The Angel.

02:46.894 --> 02:50.933
- <i>I need to know...</i>
- Hello? Hello?

03:30.169 --> 03:33.395
<i>When missions go bad, there's only one rule.</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:35.795
<i>Protect your partner.</i>

03:35.875 --> 03:38.319
What a fucking mess!

03:45.351 --> 03:47.374
I'll explain everything to Miki.

03:52.157 --> 03:55.350
<i>Negotiations between Israel
and Syria collapsed today...</i>

03:55.430 --> 03:57.282
<i>...over the exchange of prisoners.</i>

03:57.362 --> 04:00.315
<i>Unconfirmed sources
blame leaks on both sides.</i>

04:00.395 --> 04:02.854
<i>The East German Government
confirmed this afternoon...</i>

04:02.934 --> 04:05.274
<i>...that all travel restrictions
have been lifted.</i>

04:05.354 --> 04:07.694
<i>Large crowds have gathered along the wall...</i>

04:07.774 --> 04:10.629
<i>...separating East
and West Berlin to celebrate.</i>

04:10.709 --> 04:14.611
<i>The Israeli Colonel Benjamin Ehud
was found dead of a heart attack...</i>

04:14.691 --> 04:16.701
<i>...in his Berlin hotel room yesterday.</i>

04:16.781 --> 04:20.694
<i>His body was flown to Israel
for a full military funeral.</i>

04:39.137 --> 04:41.492
Ari Ben-Sion, here to see Miki.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.264
- Are you armed?
- Yeah.

04:52.616 --> 04:57.041
I'm sorry, Miki. It all went wrong in Berlin.
We could not bring Ehud back alive.

04:57.121 --> 04:58.945
Yeah, I read your report.

05:07.164 --> 05:10.010
I still feel nauseous...

05:11.530 --> 05:14.224
...about all the lies I told at his funeral.

05:17.774 --> 05:19.635
Of course...

05:20.051 --> 05:21.916
...the truth...

05:22.256 --> 05:24.097
...would have hurt more.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.604
Then why did he do it?

05:26.984 --> 05:28.541
Money?

05:30.438 --> 05:32.528
I doubt we shall ever know.

05:33.823 --> 05:35.670
So, Miki...

05:36.197 --> 05:38.048
...why am I here?

05:38.128 --> 05:42.853
Our people in Berlin will help with any
clean up you cannot do from here.

05:42.933 --> 05:46.620
I want you in for a full assessment.

05:47.804 --> 05:49.792
I'm good, Miki.

05:49.872 --> 05:51.697
I have no doubt.

05:55.445 --> 05:57.465
Sleeping well?

05:58.865 --> 06:00.722
Like a baby.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.901
How many alcoholic drinks would you say
you consume on an average day?

06:07.981 --> 06:11.679
<i>I moved to Israel from Germany
when I was a child.</i>

06:12.513 --> 06:15.284
<i>I did not adjust well.</i>

06:15.364 --> 06:18.623
<i>I was sent to more psychiatrists
than I could count.</i>

06:18.703 --> 06:21.959
<i>I learned how to tell them
what they wanted to hear.</i>

06:25.241 --> 06:27.598
So you and your wife have separated?

06:31.581 --> 06:35.173
<i>We just couldn't recover after our son died.</i>

06:36.753 --> 06:38.276
<i>Ari?</i>

06:40.223 --> 06:41.793
Ari...

06:42.283 --> 06:44.860
...it's very easy to get lost
in your cover...

06:44.940 --> 06:47.585
...and neglect the problems
in your real life.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.927
It's been less than a year
since the accident.

06:54.337 --> 06:57.025
Do you think your son's death
affected your last mission?

06:57.105 --> 06:58.958
What do you want me to say?

07:00.109 --> 07:04.134
He would've killed my partner,
let's stop wasting time.

07:06.414 --> 07:09.705
You're here to tell Miki
if I'm okay to be reassigned.

07:09.785 --> 07:11.673
And are you?

07:41.799 --> 07:43.607
Have some tea.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.025
Earlier today, we captured an Israeli spy.

07:56.831 --> 08:00.654
If we act quickly we may be able
to trade him for your sons.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.117
Hm.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.350
I promise you...

08:04.430 --> 08:06.743
...I'll get our children home.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.835
General.

08:14.382 --> 08:17.439
- Sarraj.
- Good afternoon, General.

08:18.319 --> 08:20.917
<i>I just heard the good news.</i>

08:20.997 --> 08:24.178
Congratulations on arresting the Israeli spy.

08:24.258 --> 08:27.446
- Excellent work.
- I was told it was urgent.

08:27.526 --> 08:32.621
It is. Have you begun discussions with the
Israelis regarding a prisoner exchange?

08:32.702 --> 08:34.888
That would be premature.

08:34.967 --> 08:38.592
<i>I doubt our President would see it that way.</i>

08:38.672 --> 08:40.994
I appreciate the insight.

08:41.073 --> 08:43.998
<i>Timing is everything in these matters.</i>

08:44.078 --> 08:46.265
I could not agree more.

08:46.345 --> 08:51.177
Take very good care of our Israeli guest.
And keep me fully informed.

08:51.257 --> 08:53.141
I will do that.

09:07.468 --> 09:09.855
What are you doing? Hello?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.208
No pictures here. No pictures!

09:18.144 --> 09:21.181
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
- Hey! Hey!

09:21.261 --> 09:24.204
Stop! Stop! She does not understand!

09:24.284 --> 09:27.826
- I told her no photos!
- Gentlemen, listen to me.

09:27.906 --> 09:30.812
It's alright. Good shabbos.

09:33.725 --> 09:35.205
Are you okay?

09:36.745 --> 09:39.357
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

09:40.532 --> 09:43.958
You're bleeding, let me help you.

09:52.177 --> 09:55.670
- These are good.
- I got it, thanks.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.656
Come with me.

10:07.393 --> 10:09.482
Let's see what we can do.

10:10.442 --> 10:13.967
- How is your equipment?
- It's fine, I think.

10:17.469 --> 10:21.533
- You're a journalist?
- USA Today.

10:21.613 --> 10:24.029
And I guess you're not Jewish.

10:24.109 --> 10:26.533
Well, my mother was.

10:28.946 --> 10:30.836
It's Shabbat.

10:30.916 --> 10:34.506
You're a girl, breaking all their rules.

10:34.586 --> 10:38.444
Even being around you
is making them less holy.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.316
You must have kids.

10:47.098 --> 10:49.122
All done.

10:50.935 --> 10:53.424
You'll be safe getting to your destination?

10:53.504 --> 10:55.394
Yeah, I'll be fine.

10:55.474 --> 10:58.164
Well, it has been an experience to meet you.

10:59.611 --> 11:03.000
Wait! Wait.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.105
You caught me at a bad moment. That was nice.

11:07.952 --> 11:09.809
Don't mention it.

11:10.821 --> 11:12.695
You're interested.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.445
I really should go.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.149
- Where are you from?
- Germany.

11:18.229 --> 11:20.051
It's amazing what is happening
there right now.

11:20.131 --> 11:21.352
Yeah, yeah.

11:21.432 --> 11:24.522
- I'm Kim Johnson.
- Hans Hoffman.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.492
You're lying.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.257
You are interested.

11:33.183 --> 11:37.825
I'm only here for a couple more days and
then, I'm off to Syria on assignment, but...

11:38.926 --> 11:40.771
...call me.

11:52.095 --> 11:53.685
Up!

12:22.891 --> 12:24.701
Who's The Angel?

12:25.826 --> 12:29.054
Who is stealing my country's secrets?

12:34.637 --> 12:36.195
Thirsty?

12:50.519 --> 12:52.577
You can trust me, my friend.

13:07.386 --> 13:10.811
I told you, I don't know.

13:26.354 --> 13:29.146
It doesn't matter how high up your friend is.

13:32.927 --> 13:34.785
It's just you and me.

13:46.639 --> 13:48.299
All I need...

13:48.379 --> 13:50.980
...is just a name and you're free to go.

13:55.082 --> 13:57.140
I really don't know.

14:44.164 --> 14:48.622
Tell General Fuad
unfortunately our Israeli guest...

14:48.702 --> 14:51.758
...was unable to recover from his wounds.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.831
<i>One of our agents
has been killed in Damascus.</i>

14:57.911 --> 15:00.935
<i>We have to assume everyone
has been compromised.</i>

15:01.015 --> 15:02.997
- We're pulling everyone out.
- Because of the traitor?

15:03.077 --> 15:05.251
- Yes.
- Morning, Ari.

15:05.331 --> 15:06.875
Morning.

15:07.555 --> 15:10.350
Doctor Hazem Hamra.

15:10.430 --> 15:12.410
A Jewish scientist...

15:12.490 --> 15:16.790
...who was our eyes and ears inside
Syrian's chemical weapons program.

15:16.870 --> 15:20.955
We don't know if he was burned by Ehud
but we're not gonna wait to find out.

15:21.835 --> 15:24.344
We want him and his family out
as soon as possible.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.326
Now, they live in the Jewish Quarter...

15:27.406 --> 15:31.491
...which the Mukhabarat
monitor around the clock...

15:31.571 --> 15:34.901
...and it's too risky
to approach him directly.

15:34.981 --> 15:37.058
So we are going...

15:38.565 --> 15:40.574
...through her. Rachel Khatib.

15:40.654 --> 15:44.010
Housekeeper to this man, Franz Ludin.

15:44.090 --> 15:45.277
Nazi.

15:45.357 --> 15:48.828
He was a minor player during the war
but we've been watching him.

15:48.908 --> 15:52.551
This is Herr Ludin today
with his good friend...

15:52.631 --> 15:55.988
...Main Al-Husseini,
Syria's Minister for Trade.

15:56.068 --> 15:59.215
He wants to market Syrian carpets in Europe.

15:59.295 --> 16:02.587
So we will tip the minister
that Hans Hoffman...

16:02.667 --> 16:05.751
...is keen to meet Germans of the Old Order.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.661
The minister will introduce you to Ludin...

16:08.741 --> 16:11.637
...gain his trust, get to his house...

16:11.717 --> 16:16.810
...get to Rachel. And she should have
no problem in reaching Dr. Hamra.

16:17.690 --> 16:19.145
That's a lot of links.

16:19.225 --> 16:22.032
Shaul will organize
your escape route to the coast...

16:22.112 --> 16:25.814
...meet you in Damascus on Sunday,
there'll be plenty of time to get to the girl.

16:25.894 --> 16:27.947
I'll have a back-up plan, if we need it.

16:28.027 --> 16:30.849
- Good.
- Prep starts immediately.

16:40.345 --> 16:43.535
Let's review. We meet there, 6:00pm.

16:43.615 --> 16:47.338
- Right. What if Shaul does not show?
- Then Plan B.

16:47.418 --> 16:49.087
Which is?

16:49.167 --> 16:51.509
Cafe Teyrouzi, 24 hours later.

16:51.589 --> 16:54.815
Good. And where is the Jewish Quarter?

16:58.229 --> 17:00.687
- Over there.
- Let's go!

17:05.936 --> 17:07.992
<i>Remain dark.</i>

17:08.071 --> 17:11.292
<i>No communication, no calls...</i>

17:11.373 --> 17:13.631
<i>...no messages.</i>

17:13.711 --> 17:16.733
<i>Last time. Password?</i>

17:16.814 --> 17:20.104
- <i>Caleb home.</i>
- <i>And The Angel's response?</i>

17:20.184 --> 17:23.174
- <i>Knock on the door.</i>
- <i>Good.</i>

17:23.253 --> 17:28.480
<i>I am the only one who knows The Angel's
identity and I am certain he's clean.</i>

17:28.960 --> 17:33.205
<i>Go to him,
but only if your life is in danger.</i>

17:34.098 --> 17:36.554
<i>I'm not losing another agent.</i>

18:05.095 --> 18:07.700
Have you ever been to occupied Palestine?

18:08.895 --> 18:10.454
No.

18:39.662 --> 18:43.087
<i>He has been fully checked out
by our people in Germany.</i>

18:43.667 --> 18:48.190
- You say his father was SS?
- Yes, he served at Dachau.

18:48.270 --> 18:51.794
Among other things, he funds
right-wing parties in Germany.

18:51.874 --> 18:54.330
Trust me... he's a friend.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.132
And he wants what?

18:56.212 --> 18:58.801
To buy carpets and sell them in Europe.

18:58.881 --> 19:00.970
And what do you want from me?

19:01.750 --> 19:04.039
Help him to feel at home.

19:04.119 --> 19:06.609
The more comfortable he is,
the more he spends.

19:06.689 --> 19:09.526
The more he spends,
the more thanks I owe you.

19:10.426 --> 19:13.482
- He's here, Herr Hoffman!
- Yeah.

19:14.462 --> 19:17.418
Welcome to Damascus. I'm Main Al-Husseini...

19:17.498 --> 19:19.995
- ...the Minister of Trade.
- My pleasure to meet you.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.159
I hope you don't mind, I invited a friend...

19:23.939 --> 19:27.529
...Herr Hans Hoffman...
meet Herr Franz Ludin.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.732
- <i>Guten Abend.</i>
- <i>Guten Abend, Herr Ludin.</i>

19:29.812 --> 19:31.700
<i>Hans, bitte.</i>

19:31.980 --> 19:33.503
Please.

19:34.750 --> 19:38.706
Ambassador Al-Diri tells me
many great things about you.

19:38.786 --> 19:42.398
- Don't believe a word!
- You're interested in carpets?

19:42.478 --> 19:45.289
Syria has the finest in the world.

19:45.369 --> 19:48.196
- That's why I'm here.
- A drink?

19:48.276 --> 19:50.694
- I'll have whatever you are having.
- Sir?

19:50.774 --> 19:54.022
- Another arak, please.
- First time in Damascus?

19:54.102 --> 19:57.011
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to exploring the city.

19:57.091 --> 20:01.329
It's not Germany,
but it has some redeeming qualities.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.132
Herr Ludin has lived here many, many years.

20:04.212 --> 20:08.642
- He knows the city well.
- The oldest inhabited city in the world.

20:09.517 --> 20:12.742
The past looks a lot more appealing
when you get to my age.

20:12.822 --> 20:15.196
You should show him around, Franz.

20:15.276 --> 20:18.453
- I'd be happy to.
- I wouldn't want to impose.

20:18.533 --> 20:22.181
Friday is a Muslim holiday,
hopeless for business. If you're free?

20:22.261 --> 20:23.998
Good.

20:24.078 --> 20:26.155
To exploring the city!

20:27.735 --> 20:29.924
- And to new friends.
- <i>Prost!</i>

20:30.004 --> 20:31.594
<i>Prost!</i>

20:44.518 --> 20:47.741
- It was a pleasure doing business with you.
- Thank you, it was a pleasure for me.

20:47.821 --> 20:50.112
- Thank you.
- See you again soon.

21:22.956 --> 21:25.414
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- Thank you.

21:30.597 --> 21:32.318
Hey!

21:32.398 --> 21:34.455
Are you following me?

21:35.835 --> 21:37.190
What are you doing here?

21:37.270 --> 21:41.393
I'm here on an assignment like I said,
or have you forgotten me completely?

21:41.473 --> 21:46.233
- I'm sorry, I didn't call.
- This is crazy! What are you doing here?

21:46.313 --> 21:48.569
Unexpected business opportunity.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.960
Is this your hotel?

21:51.040 --> 21:53.308
- You, too?
- Yeah.

21:54.888 --> 21:56.992
Come on, Kim.

21:57.077 --> 22:00.746
- Gotta go. Good seeing you.
- And you.

22:20.211 --> 22:24.270
Muslims, Christians, Jews,
it's not going to end well.

22:24.350 --> 22:26.738
So much older than Europe.

22:26.818 --> 22:28.841
Do you miss Germany?

22:29.521 --> 22:31.377
Of course.

22:32.257 --> 22:35.347
But the Germany I knew doesn't exist anymore.

22:36.227 --> 22:38.717
They were the greatest country in the world.

22:39.497 --> 22:41.989
United, we would be again.

22:44.269 --> 22:47.762
You remind me... I used to talk like that.

22:53.545 --> 22:56.792
- This place is such a maze.
- Yes.

22:57.716 --> 23:00.174
And sometimes you end up...

23:00.254 --> 23:02.255
...where you don't want to be.

23:04.956 --> 23:07.627
- The Jewish Quarter.
- Yes.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.905
They can come and go...

23:10.985 --> 23:12.826
...but never a whole family.

23:13.931 --> 23:15.487
Why?

23:15.567 --> 23:17.989
President Assad wants to keep them.

23:18.069 --> 23:20.160
They're a bargaining chip.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.700
Bam! Bam!

23:31.852 --> 23:33.237
- Thank you.
- Are you hurt?

23:33.317 --> 23:36.213
- No, no.
- Allow me to defend you.

23:40.958 --> 23:42.548
Bam!

23:45.846 --> 23:47.469
Kids!

24:28.672 --> 24:31.094
- Hello?
- <i>It's Hans.</i>

24:31.174 --> 24:34.631
<i>I'm sorry to call you so late.
You left your wallet in my car.</i>

24:34.711 --> 24:38.755
Oh, thank goodness.
I have been searching everywhere for it.

24:39.315 --> 24:41.838
I can drop it by in the morning.

24:41.918 --> 24:46.509
<i>No need. Some friends are
coming over for drinks tomorrow night.</i>

24:46.589 --> 24:49.814
<i>A few local Germans. If you're not busy?</i>

24:50.844 --> 24:53.701
- What time?
- <i>8:00 o'clock.</i>

24:54.831 --> 24:58.121
- Sounds good.
- <i>You can bring the wallet then.</i>

24:58.501 --> 25:00.992
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

25:13.349 --> 25:16.373
- Where are you from?
- You really don't let up, do you?

25:17.453 --> 25:20.543
- Have a drink with me.
- Really, no, thank you.

25:20.623 --> 25:23.724
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

25:30.433 --> 25:32.921
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:33.301 --> 25:36.764
Save me. I told him
I'm waiting for my husband.

25:38.206 --> 25:40.029
What's it worth?

25:41.109 --> 25:43.111
I'll let you buy me dinner.

25:44.279 --> 25:45.736
Deal!

25:47.282 --> 25:52.541
We have been on the road for two months,
Egypt, Jordan, Israel and now here.

25:53.221 --> 25:56.331
We're just trying to give
our readers a little insight.

25:56.411 --> 26:01.117
To be honest, I'm just starting to
understand how complicated it is here.

26:02.997 --> 26:06.555
And what about you? What brings you to Syria?

26:06.635 --> 26:08.490
Cheap carpets.

26:08.570 --> 26:11.461
And here I thought
you were just following me.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.330
Would that have been a better answer?

26:18.546 --> 26:20.094
And...

26:20.669 --> 26:22.675
...apart from work?

26:24.452 --> 26:26.308
What would you like to know?

26:26.388 --> 26:28.843
The thing that you least want to tell me...

26:28.923 --> 26:32.762
...your deepest, darkest secret.

26:41.609 --> 26:43.529
And if I have...

26:43.609 --> 26:45.520
...nothing to hide?

26:45.600 --> 26:48.097
Well, that would be very disappointing.

26:55.848 --> 27:00.307
All I can tell you is, it involves
a lot of vodka and a strip club!

27:00.756 --> 27:02.810
Booze is in my blood.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.749
- Thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:08.328 --> 27:10.818
- MAN; Hans, where are you from?
- Berlin.

27:10.898 --> 27:14.141
- We were just talking about Berlin.
- I have got a couple of friends posted there.

27:14.221 --> 27:17.424
I don't think they have been
sober since the wall fell.

27:17.504 --> 27:21.095
- Lucky for them.
- I can imagine it's crazy there right now.

27:21.675 --> 27:23.446
Makes you wish we were there.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.658
Help me!

27:31.452 --> 27:33.476
Free Syria!

27:33.987 --> 27:35.578
Help!

27:36.690 --> 27:38.579
Oh, that's tough, man.

27:39.599 --> 27:42.849
- Are you okay?
- What the hell was that?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.918
They don't even hide what they do.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.554
- Because they want you to know.
- Know what?

27:47.634 --> 27:51.125
That they're watching and listening,
everybody, all the time.

27:52.205 --> 27:55.856
- Sounds like East Germany.
- Well, not anymore.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.705
Well, things could change here, too.

27:59.785 --> 28:03.769
That's what they said about Berlin
and now the wall's down, so...

28:03.849 --> 28:06.536
...if that wall fell, anything is possible.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.744
I'll drink to that.

29:35.874 --> 29:39.353
I... gotta get up really early.

29:41.139 --> 29:43.034
I have an assignment.

29:43.447 --> 29:45.271
You know where to find me.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.248
It is made with my finest silk.

29:57.928 --> 29:59.816
I'll take 50.

29:59.896 --> 30:01.518
My pleasure.

30:01.598 --> 30:05.266
For you... the traditional Syrian dress.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.093
Hope you like.

30:09.573 --> 30:11.397
It's beautiful.

30:21.301 --> 30:23.073
Good evening.

30:23.153 --> 30:27.240
- Good evening.
- <i>Guten Abend.</i> Welcome.

30:28.424 --> 30:30.247
Thank you.

30:32.842 --> 30:35.519
- Your wallet.
- Oh, thanks.

30:36.632 --> 30:39.290
Gentlemen, meet Herr Hans Hoffman.

30:39.870 --> 30:42.392
May I present... Herr Heinrich Wolff.

30:42.472 --> 30:44.427
I prefer Steffen Schmidt.

30:44.507 --> 30:47.998
Ignore him. A Mossad letter bomb
blew off two of his fingers...

30:48.078 --> 30:50.968
...and it makes him feel
more important than he is.

30:51.648 --> 30:54.372
And this gentleman is Colonel
Ludwig Streicher...

30:54.452 --> 30:56.713
...advisor to the Syrian Army.

30:56.793 --> 30:59.397
That was a number of years ago, Franz.

31:00.890 --> 31:04.544
Can I get you something to drink,
Berlinerwasser perhaps?

31:04.994 --> 31:08.638
- Whisky, if you have it.
- Can you get Herr Hoffman a whisky?

31:11.467 --> 31:15.275
Hans, is it true your father
served in the camps?

31:15.355 --> 31:17.584
Yeah... Dachau.

31:17.664 --> 31:21.621
- What was his position?
- He was quite undistinguished.

31:21.701 --> 31:25.734
Easy, gentlemen. Let's not forget
Herr Hoffman is our guest.

31:25.814 --> 31:28.430
I'm sure he understands
our need to be careful.

31:28.510 --> 31:31.273
- Heinrich, we have nothing to be scared of.
- Thank you.

31:31.353 --> 31:35.208
The Israelis are not interested in us
anymore. They have new enemies.

31:35.958 --> 31:38.382
Enemies, that's all they've got.

31:39.761 --> 31:41.724
Where are you staying in Damascus?

31:41.804 --> 31:44.653
- Sheraton.
- Good choice.

31:46.033 --> 31:47.516
So...

31:47.596 --> 31:50.997
...Hans... with our host's permission.

31:51.873 --> 31:54.496
What can you tell us about your father?

31:54.576 --> 31:56.665
Unfortunately, very little.

31:57.645 --> 32:01.329
- He died when I was four.
- The world likes to forget...

32:01.409 --> 32:05.561
...the nine million Germans
murdered during the war.

32:06.522 --> 32:09.541
No, it was after the war.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.514
- Car crash.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.584
Are you expecting someone?

32:16.664 --> 32:18.188
No.

32:18.834 --> 32:21.628
- Excuse me.
- I wonder who that is?

32:27.108 --> 32:29.199
Come in, come in.

32:31.112 --> 32:36.405
I believe you know everyone,
except our new friend, Herr Hans Hoffman.

32:36.485 --> 32:40.910
Suleiman Sarraj is head of the Mukhabarat,
the Syrian intelligence agency.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.525
- Pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

32:44.605 --> 32:46.647
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

32:46.727 --> 32:49.092
Herr Hoffman is visiting from Berlin...

32:49.172 --> 32:51.152
...we met through the Trade Minister.

32:51.232 --> 32:54.289
- Yes, I know.
- Of course, you do.

32:55.568 --> 32:59.141
Don't be concerned, Hans.
Lucky for us, Sarraj is a good friend.

33:02.192 --> 33:04.064
You're here purchasing carpets?

33:04.144 --> 33:05.967
- Correct.
- Is it going well?

33:06.047 --> 33:07.935
- It is.
- Good.

33:08.015 --> 33:12.573
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thank you. I can stay only for a moment.

33:12.653 --> 33:15.476
I was nearby and I realized
it's been too long...

33:15.556 --> 33:18.813
...since I checked in with you
and your friends.

33:18.893 --> 33:22.816
I read in the papers
that you arrested an Israeli spy.

33:22.896 --> 33:24.919
Congratulations.

33:25.399 --> 33:27.320
I was merely doing my job.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.457
What will happen to him?

33:29.737 --> 33:33.775
Well, unfortunately,
the Israeli did not survive his capture.

33:36.110 --> 33:39.167
Did you find out why he was here?

33:43.182 --> 33:45.405
Thank you for your kind
hospitality. Excuse me.

33:45.485 --> 33:47.688
You're welcome here any time.

33:49.856 --> 33:52.512
- It was very nice to meet you, Hans.
- And you.

33:52.592 --> 33:54.514
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

33:54.594 --> 33:58.086
- Thank you.
- If you need anything, please...

34:01.968 --> 34:04.872
- Perhaps we meet again.
- I hope so.

34:05.472 --> 34:07.578
Gentlemen, good evening.

34:11.011 --> 34:14.098
Excuse me... too much to drink.

34:15.614 --> 34:18.638
- First door before the kitchen.
- Thank you.

34:34.132 --> 34:37.856
Suleiman Sarraj has become one
of the most powerful men in Syria.

34:37.936 --> 34:40.092
It was nice of him to stop by.

34:40.172 --> 34:44.096
With all due respect, Franz,
we all know the man.

34:44.176 --> 34:46.333
Sarraj did not come here to be nice.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.746
Rachel Khatib?

34:54.219 --> 34:58.310
- Remind me, how did you meet him?
- Calm down, gentlemen.

34:58.390 --> 35:01.514
The Trade Minister assured me
he was fully checked out.

35:02.594 --> 35:05.718
You have a brother... his name is Yair.

35:05.798 --> 35:09.353
He lives with his wife and children
in Haroe Street in Haifa.

35:09.433 --> 35:12.358
Mm-hm? I've come to get you out of here.

35:12.438 --> 35:17.133
All the Minister cares about is how much
money Hoffman will put in his pocket.

35:39.997 --> 35:41.429
Now, listen, I...

35:44.935 --> 35:46.491
What's going on here?

35:54.312 --> 35:56.135
I think it's time you left.

36:00.017 --> 36:01.841
I'm sorry.

36:55.437 --> 36:57.295
Is it true?

37:04.814 --> 37:06.671
Stop it.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.289
You brought a gun?

37:12.489 --> 37:14.946
Sit down and be quiet.

37:20.562 --> 37:23.787
- How did you find me?
- I overheard you at dinner. Is it true?

37:23.867 --> 37:25.488
- You could've been followed.
- I was careful.

37:25.568 --> 37:27.854
You were stupid.

37:28.341 --> 37:31.460
- And the gun?
- Herr Ludin's.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.964
Are you really here to take me to Israel?

37:34.344 --> 37:35.868
Yes.

37:38.747 --> 37:41.237
- I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.

37:42.717 --> 37:45.708
I need you to make contact with Dr. Hamra.

37:46.688 --> 37:49.178
Tell him to gather his family. It's...

37:49.858 --> 37:51.747
The police?

37:52.427 --> 37:54.071
Get on the bed.

38:11.379 --> 38:13.670
Hm, nice room.

38:29.631 --> 38:31.701
I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.

38:34.502 --> 38:36.092
Kim...

38:39.140 --> 38:41.075
Who is that?

38:41.155 --> 38:42.956
No one.

38:44.258 --> 38:47.070
- You want something?
- I want my gun back.

38:49.050 --> 38:52.073
Leave the Jewish Quarter, one at a time.

38:52.553 --> 38:56.009
Tell everyone to meet
at the Mariamite Cathedral...

38:56.089 --> 38:58.347
...Monday night, 10 o'clock.

38:59.127 --> 39:02.040
Ask for Father Vergisa.

39:02.390 --> 39:04.552
If you see me before then...

39:04.632 --> 39:08.924
...that will be my signal
that the escape is off.

39:09.897 --> 39:12.595
Put his gun back before anyone notices.

39:32.826 --> 39:35.516
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Sabeen?</i>

39:36.796 --> 39:38.151
Yeah.

39:38.231 --> 39:41.489
<i>I have some information
I think you'd be very interested in.</i>

39:42.569 --> 39:44.459
Hang on.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.198
Who is this?

39:51.278 --> 39:53.998
- <i>It's about Hans Hoffman.</i>
- What do you want?

39:54.078 --> 39:57.538
<i>$10,000. Bring the money
tomorrow evening, Sunday at 8:00.</i>

39:57.618 --> 39:59.707
<i>Meet me in front of Salim's Food Market.</i>

39:59.787 --> 40:02.477
But... hello?

40:21.406 --> 40:23.062
Yes?

40:23.142 --> 40:25.564
<i>It's Sabeen, sorry to bother you.</i>

40:25.644 --> 40:27.066
What is the problem?

40:27.146 --> 40:31.837
<i>I just got a call from a man selling
information on an Israeli we are tracking.</i>

40:31.917 --> 40:34.608
- Who?
- <i>Hans Hoffman.</i>

40:36.589 --> 40:39.861
- How much does he want?
- <i>$10,000.</i>

40:41.961 --> 40:43.708
Go see what he's got.

40:44.828 --> 40:48.121
- <i>And ask him about The Angel.</i>
- I will.

40:48.201 --> 40:50.491
- <i>Be careful.</i>
- Okay.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.461
General Fuad.

40:58.944 --> 41:00.800
$10,000?

41:01.530 --> 41:03.386
And he agreed?

41:04.116 --> 41:05.838
Unbelievable!

41:07.118 --> 41:09.142
Okay. Goodbye.

41:28.539 --> 41:31.495
<i>So, we've organized
your escape route to the coast.</i>

41:31.575 --> 41:33.423
<i>We'll meet you in Damascus on Sunday and...</i>

41:33.503 --> 41:36.004
<i>We have a back-up plan if we need it.</i>

42:06.810 --> 42:08.866
<i>Israeli agents are in Syria.</i>

42:09.046 --> 42:12.679
<i>I'm shocked. What's that
got to do with Hoffman?</i>

42:12.949 --> 42:16.063
Hans Hoffman is a Mossad spy...

42:16.143 --> 42:19.209
<i>...his real name is Ari Ben-Sion.</i>

42:19.289 --> 42:22.280
<i>Sorry, we know that already.</i>

42:22.360 --> 42:24.848
<i>But do you know why he's in Damascus?</i>

42:24.928 --> 42:26.450
<i>Tell me.</i>

42:26.530 --> 42:28.720
<i>He's leading an exfiltration mission.</i>

42:29.434 --> 42:33.957
- Who's escaping?
- Their most senior, deep-cover asset.

42:34.037 --> 42:37.276
They call him The Angel.

42:44.481 --> 42:46.071
Whiskey.

42:50.887 --> 42:54.977
I know what it must have
looked like, but it wasn't.

42:55.057 --> 42:57.506
It's okay, sometimes I...

42:57.586 --> 43:00.183
...create expectations...

43:00.263 --> 43:04.756
...fantasies of how I want things
to be and then I get disappointed.

43:06.136 --> 43:08.192
I should've called first.

43:18.647 --> 43:20.603
It stopped working.

43:20.683 --> 43:22.506
It's beautiful.

43:24.021 --> 43:25.909
It was my father's.

43:29.191 --> 43:31.249
I wish I had known him better.

43:32.528 --> 43:34.786
This is all that I have left of him.

43:42.104 --> 43:43.962
What do you want?

43:45.741 --> 43:47.598
I don't know.

43:51.714 --> 43:53.604
Me neither.

44:04.660 --> 44:06.416
Can I get you something?

44:07.729 --> 44:10.421
- Coffee, maybe.
- Coffee?

44:26.114 --> 44:27.942
How do you take it?

44:28.717 --> 44:30.255
Kim?

44:32.850 --> 44:34.362
Kim?

44:51.439 --> 44:54.544
<i>Daddy! Daddy where are you?</i>

44:54.624 --> 44:56.272
<i>Daddy!</i>

45:14.728 --> 45:16.552
I will remember.

45:17.532 --> 45:19.388
Did she pick the right one?

45:23.270 --> 45:24.776
Good.

45:25.652 --> 45:29.680
Promise me to be careful on that thing
and always wear a helmet, Sammy.

45:30.110 --> 45:32.508
Sam, did you hear me?

45:32.588 --> 45:35.189
Good, that's our deal, right?

45:36.350 --> 45:37.906
Okay.

45:39.491 --> 45:43.579
I'm glad that you had a good party, baby.
I wish I could have been there.

45:48.328 --> 45:50.419
I know you're not a baby.

45:53.634 --> 45:55.456
I love you.

46:20.159 --> 46:22.016
Good morning.

46:26.399 --> 46:28.254
You heard?

46:28.334 --> 46:30.156
Yeah.

46:30.236 --> 46:32.428
It's his birthday.

46:34.975 --> 46:36.583
He lives with his dad.

46:37.943 --> 46:39.800
How old is he?

46:40.580 --> 46:42.120
Eight...

46:43.045 --> 46:44.501
...today.

46:45.685 --> 46:47.742
It goes so fast.

46:49.689 --> 46:51.210
Yeah.

46:51.390 --> 46:52.931
He's...

46:54.013 --> 46:56.276
...becoming a stranger.

46:57.863 --> 46:59.885
You could change that.

47:00.465 --> 47:02.665
Someone once told me...

47:02.745 --> 47:05.624
...that if the Berlin wall can fall...

47:05.704 --> 47:07.528
...anything is possible.

47:27.759 --> 47:29.583
I'm sorry.

48:35.326 --> 48:37.956
I also missed my son's 8th birthday.

48:40.197 --> 48:42.488
He really loved football.

48:45.136 --> 48:49.194
His team was Bayern Munich.

48:52.376 --> 48:56.669
But I was working, I was always working.

49:01.051 --> 49:03.105
He went into my office.

49:05.187 --> 49:08.480
He wanted to inflate a football,
or something.

49:14.264 --> 49:16.094
I had a gun.

49:18.363 --> 49:20.790
It was usually locked away, but...

49:23.049 --> 49:24.929
...I must have left it.

49:33.216 --> 49:35.240
Now I don't sleep so well.

49:55.203 --> 49:58.320
- Any chance she suspected your cover?
- No.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.353
You were right, they already knew about Ari.

50:05.448 --> 50:07.236
Check out Kim Johnson?

50:07.316 --> 50:09.573
I haven't been able to find a thing.

50:19.728 --> 50:21.747
What's worrying you?

50:23.197 --> 50:26.400
We could've told him he's working naked...

50:26.480 --> 50:28.291
...and he's on his own.

50:30.772 --> 50:32.361
No.

50:32.641 --> 50:35.531
This is the best way to protect The Angel.

50:37.111 --> 50:39.150
Ari will know more...

50:40.271 --> 50:42.091
...when he needs to.

50:42.751 --> 50:44.608
I hope you're right.

50:46.154 --> 50:48.011
Me, too.

51:00.401 --> 51:02.225
General Fuad.

51:08.008 --> 51:09.931
Where has he been and where is he now?

51:11.811 --> 51:13.326
Mm-hmm.

51:13.602 --> 51:15.137
Mm-hmm.

51:16.046 --> 51:17.168
Good.

51:30.931 --> 51:32.388
Hans.

51:34.468 --> 51:36.487
I have an appointment.

51:37.648 --> 51:39.327
I'll see you tonight.

51:39.407 --> 51:41.431
I'll meet you in the bar?

51:43.143 --> 51:45.200
I may be a little late.

51:46.180 --> 51:48.235
You can wait here, if you like.

51:48.915 --> 51:50.805
Are you sure?

51:51.485 --> 51:53.075
Yeah.

52:19.412 --> 52:21.234
Thank you.

52:36.163 --> 52:37.752
Look.

53:07.325 --> 53:09.184
Why are you running?

53:11.931 --> 53:13.788
What's in your pocket?

53:38.290 --> 53:41.213
- <i>If you see me again, the escape is off.</i>
- It's not open for discussion.

53:41.293 --> 53:43.624
- It's very easy to get lost in your cover.
- You are interested.

53:43.704 --> 53:45.428
- Protect your partner.
- ...back-up plan, if we need it.

53:45.508 --> 53:48.830
- Cafe Teyrouzi, 24 hours later.
- <i>Save me.</i>

53:48.910 --> 53:51.690
<i>I am the only one who knows
The Angel's identity.</i>

53:51.770 --> 53:55.462
<i>Go to him only if your life is in danger.</i>

54:12.206 --> 54:13.797
Shaul.

54:48.959 --> 54:50.549
Taxi!

54:54.698 --> 54:56.520
Sheraton Hotel.

55:01.037 --> 55:03.128
There's someone else following him.

55:28.565 --> 55:30.122
Kim?

56:29.724 --> 56:31.614
Get in the car.

56:39.368 --> 56:41.858
- Follow the white car.
- Yes, sir.

57:13.601 --> 57:15.659
Stop here! Stop here!

58:55.935 --> 58:57.758
Wait here.

59:05.145 --> 59:07.376
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.973
- Is Herr Ludin at home?
- He's not here.

59:11.053 --> 59:14.273
Could you tell him Hans Hoffman
came by to apologize?

59:14.853 --> 59:17.277
And... the maid...

59:17.357 --> 59:20.536
...I'd like to apologize to her, also.
Is she here?

59:20.616 --> 59:22.850
Not here after dinner with you.

59:23.895 --> 59:25.486
Is...

59:27.556 --> 59:29.123
Shit!

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.491
What is it you want, Sarraj?

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:11.300
I know the President
has assigned you to find a mole...

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.851
...the Israelis refer to as The Angel.

01:00:13.931 --> 01:00:16.634
You have spies in my service?

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.634
As you have in mine.

01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:21.012
We're wasting time bumping into each other.

01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:24.041
So now you want to work together?

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.705
To capture The Angel? Yes.
Ari Ben-Sion can lead us to him...

01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:30.647
...and we can arrest both of them.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:35.186
Can you stop your men from beating him
again until he meets The Angel?

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:36.403
Yes.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.575
And you have a plan?

01:00:44.655 --> 01:00:45.991
Yes, I do.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:49.355
What if your plan fails?

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:52.838
I will take full responsibility for it.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.959
Put me through to President Assad.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.834
Tell him it's urgent.

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.724
Hans? I'm back.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.643
Hans?

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:18.124
Hans?

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.769
He's not here.

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:02.106
Yeah.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.889
Ticket, please.

01:03:02.093 --> 01:03:04.933
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Caleb home.

01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:08.038
Knock on the door at the end of the path.

01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:26.923
Beautiful evening.

01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:33.496
Follow me.

01:03:51.191 --> 01:03:53.114
Nice car.

01:03:53.194 --> 01:03:55.048
You must be thirsty.

01:03:55.128 --> 01:03:57.184
And you must be The Angel.

01:03:57.764 --> 01:04:01.256
Here my name is Sabri Al-Alazar.

01:04:02.236 --> 01:04:04.724
My exfiltration partner has vanished.

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:08.722
I'm being watched closely,
and they sent me a girl.

01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:13.934
Why am I not in a cell? Or dead?

01:04:14.014 --> 01:04:16.203
Because your real mission...

01:04:16.283 --> 01:04:20.941
...is to lead the head of the Mukhabarat
to me. He's our target.

01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:23.510
We are here to kill Sarraj?

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:26.647
In a way, he's promised President Assad...

01:04:26.727 --> 01:04:29.316
...that you're going
to lead him to The Angel.

01:04:29.396 --> 01:04:31.452
Our escape will end his career.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.654
So I'm bait?

01:04:35.734 --> 01:04:37.804
Why wasn't I told?

01:04:38.472 --> 01:04:41.027
What about Rachel Khatib and Dr. Hamra?

01:04:41.107 --> 01:04:43.414
They are no longer your concern.

01:04:45.546 --> 01:04:47.792
I will decide what is my concern.

01:04:50.283 --> 01:04:52.939
I don't know anything about them.

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:55.308
I'm done with this bullshit.

01:04:55.388 --> 01:04:57.711
You can take it up with Miki
when we get home.

01:04:57.791 --> 01:05:00.313
In the meantime, his bullshit protects us.

01:05:00.393 --> 01:05:02.951
I don't feel very protected!

01:05:08.734 --> 01:05:11.689
Aren't you tired of all of this?

01:05:12.004 --> 01:05:14.460
Actually, I was enjoying myself...

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.726
...until that asshole Ehud screwed us.

01:05:18.576 --> 01:05:22.170
Now I just want to get out of here alive.

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:28.420
Make Sarraj an ambitious moron...

01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:30.609
...instead of a martyr.

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:32.316
Fuck Miki!

01:05:34.694 --> 01:05:36.916
When did you find out about the girl?

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.735
How soon can we leave?

01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:46.125
<i>Operations needs 24 hours to prep...</i>

01:05:46.205 --> 01:05:48.344
<i>...return to your hotel...</i>

01:05:48.424 --> 01:05:51.597
<i>...hopefully they won't know
that you have broken their girl's cover...</i>

01:05:51.677 --> 01:05:53.977
<i>...so she should buy us some time...</i>

01:05:54.828 --> 01:05:57.103
<i>...if she suspects you, it's over.</i>

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.172
<i>They're bugging your room now.</i>

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:03.361
<i>Tomorrow evening,
invite the girl to your room.</i>

01:06:03.441 --> 01:06:07.112
<i>Once it's dark, slip my name
into your conversation...</i>

01:06:07.192 --> 01:06:09.181
<i>...Sabri Al-Alazar.</i>

01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:12.764
<i>Let her know that I'm The Angel
and that you're planning to meet me.</i>

01:06:13.464 --> 01:06:16.021
<i>They won't touch you until they have me.</i>

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:19.149
- <i>Then they better not find you.</i>
- <i>They won't.</i>

01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:22.662
<i>I'll arrange for my Mercedes
to be parked unlocked...</i>

01:06:22.742 --> 01:06:25.363
<i>...at the end of the alley behind your hotel.</i>

01:06:25.643 --> 01:06:28.483
<i>The keys and the map will be
in the glove compartment.</i>

01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:31.270
<i>You're going to need this.</i>

01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:36.675
<i>If the girl with you,
she'll get you out of the hotel.</i>

01:06:38.923 --> 01:06:40.991
<i>And when you're free of shadows...</i>

01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:45.230
<i>...terminate her.</i>

01:06:58.877 --> 01:07:00.664
Where were you?

01:07:00.744 --> 01:07:03.368
- I was working.
- This late?

01:07:04.048 --> 01:07:06.672
A client invited me to a never-ending dinner.

01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:10.342
I was worried about you.

01:07:12.356 --> 01:07:13.816
Hey...

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:16.137
...thank you for fixing my watch.

01:07:16.626 --> 01:07:18.482
You didn't have to do that.

01:07:18.962 --> 01:07:20.784
I wanted to.

01:07:21.464 --> 01:07:23.287
What's the matter?

01:07:23.967 --> 01:07:25.858
It's been a long day.

01:07:28.705 --> 01:07:30.527
- I'm tired.
- What happened?

01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:32.164
Nothing.

01:07:50.894 --> 01:07:52.750
- <i>Front desk.</i>
- Good morning.

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:54.951
Could you tell my driver
that I won't need him today?

01:07:55.031 --> 01:07:57.688
- <i>Certainly, Mr Hoffman.</i>
- Thank you.

01:08:31.033 --> 01:08:32.923
How long should we wait?

01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:38.562
I knew you would come back.

01:08:40.142 --> 01:08:42.399
Ari didn't stand a chance.

01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:50.573
You have your mother's face
and your father's eyes.

01:08:58.292 --> 01:09:00.818
Why have you forgotten all your Arabic?

01:09:02.898 --> 01:09:05.772
It means... the moon is beautiful...

01:09:05.852 --> 01:09:07.853
...but you're lovelier.

01:09:09.837 --> 01:09:12.656
So far you have done a fantastic job.

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.287
I'm proud of you.

01:09:14.642 --> 01:09:17.265
Has he mentioned The Angel?

01:09:17.845 --> 01:09:19.368
No.

01:09:19.747 --> 01:09:21.837
He does trust you?

01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:23.471
Mm.

01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:31.728
I hope you haven't forgotten
what they did to your father?

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:37.298
The first time is always the hardest.

01:09:37.866 --> 01:09:39.709
Remember, you came to me.

01:09:40.769 --> 01:09:42.352
Yes.

01:09:43.996 --> 01:09:47.662
- But...
- Did son get my birthday present?

01:09:50.845 --> 01:09:52.902
I know how important he is to you.

01:09:56.616 --> 01:09:58.476
He did.

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:01.844
Thank you.

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.716
I'll do my job.

01:10:08.796 --> 01:10:13.187
Of course, you will.
Just remember your training.

01:10:13.767 --> 01:10:16.839
Salma, I'm counting on you.

01:10:27.314 --> 01:10:28.871
Hans?

01:10:37.457 --> 01:10:39.246
You scared me.

01:10:39.326 --> 01:10:40.980
Where did you go?

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.001
Rob's doing a story on
an orphanage in the South...

01:10:44.081 --> 01:10:46.386
...he asked me to... wait.

01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:49.064
I get it... you missed me.

01:11:07.687 --> 01:11:09.575
I know.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:27.561
I wanted to tell you. I wanted to...

01:11:30.276 --> 01:11:32.499
You almost had me fooled.

01:11:33.079 --> 01:11:35.901
And now you're going to help me
fool your friends.

01:11:36.581 --> 01:11:38.472
I know they're listening.

01:11:39.752 --> 01:11:43.409
So I'm going to ask you
to leave with me tonight.

01:11:43.489 --> 01:11:47.346
And you're going to refuse
until I explain why.

01:11:48.426 --> 01:11:50.317
Do you understand?

01:11:51.297 --> 01:11:53.941
If you make one false move...

01:11:54.422 --> 01:11:56.437
...I will kill you.

01:12:14.686 --> 01:12:17.328
- Yes, we have to leave tonight.
- Hans, you're scaring me.

01:12:18.688 --> 01:12:20.689
<i>You have to trust me.</i>

01:12:21.827 --> 01:12:23.372
<i>So...</i>

01:12:23.452 --> 01:12:26.150
<i>...trust me and tell me why we have to leave.</i>

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:28.820
<i>Because I'm not who you think I am...</i>

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.246
<i>...and both our lives are in danger.</i>

01:12:31.326 --> 01:12:33.558
Hans, you're not being fair.

01:12:34.038 --> 01:12:37.767
I can't tell you everything right now.
It's not the time.

01:12:40.646 --> 01:12:42.800
How will we get out of the country?

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.067
<i>An angel has arranged everything.</i>

01:12:45.147 --> 01:12:47.772
- Who?
- Why does it matter?

01:12:47.852 --> 01:12:50.388
So I should trust you,
but you won't trust me?

01:12:50.468 --> 01:12:54.514
<i>Fine. His name is Sabri Al-Alazar.</i>

01:12:58.095 --> 01:13:00.184
We have to leave now.

01:13:00.264 --> 01:13:01.821
No!

01:13:03.634 --> 01:13:05.289
Move in! Move in!

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:08.013
What are you doing? We don't have The Angel.

01:13:20.484 --> 01:13:22.074
Here!

01:13:22.853 --> 01:13:24.510
Come out!

01:13:42.806 --> 01:13:44.629
Drop the gun.

01:13:59.489 --> 01:14:01.222
It's all right.

01:14:01.776 --> 01:14:03.580
Let's go.

01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:15.526
Go to the car.

01:14:17.473 --> 01:14:19.329
Get in.

01:14:35.124 --> 01:14:38.214
<i>He's killed all of our agents
and taken the girl.</i>

01:14:38.294 --> 01:14:41.716
Congratulations, now we lost both of them.

01:14:41.796 --> 01:14:45.823
- I told you to wait.
- I told you that my girl is good.

01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:09.046
Get out.

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:13.451
- I'm sorry, but...
- Get out.

01:15:15.864 --> 01:15:18.146
I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

01:15:18.226 --> 01:15:21.056
Sarraj is not who I thought he was.

01:15:21.136 --> 01:15:23.793
Get... out!

01:15:57.805 --> 01:15:59.695
Was any of it real?

01:16:01.042 --> 01:16:02.898
Tell me!

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.571
I wanted it to be.

01:16:22.063 --> 01:16:24.086
Please just do it!

01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:39.067
Come with me.

01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:44.052
I can't...

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:46.407
...he will hurt my son.

01:16:46.487 --> 01:16:50.380
If we escape with the Angel,
Sarraj will be finished.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.998
He will never be able to hurt anyone.

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:57.720
Is that true?

01:17:02.302 --> 01:17:04.345
I'm done with lies.

01:17:19.452 --> 01:17:21.128
Salma...

01:17:21.521 --> 01:17:24.535
...my real name is Salma.

01:17:28.328 --> 01:17:29.849
Ari.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.121
I know.

01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:52.466
Stay behind me.

01:19:13.431 --> 01:19:15.255
It's all right.

01:19:18.368 --> 01:19:20.591
You're going to get us killed.

01:19:20.971 --> 01:19:23.960
- She's with them.
- We can trust her.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.099
You're a fool to bring her!

01:19:33.184 --> 01:19:35.004
She screwed us!

01:19:35.284 --> 01:19:37.542
- Salma.
- This is not me!

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:41.258
This is not because of me!
I have no idea how they found us.

01:19:42.759 --> 01:19:44.357
Ari...

01:19:46.138 --> 01:19:47.733
...no more lies.

01:19:54.771 --> 01:19:56.356
No!

01:19:56.806 --> 01:19:58.896
Our paratroopers won't wait.

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:06.237
Come on! We've got to move!

01:20:11.086 --> 01:20:12.611
Ari.

01:20:16.026 --> 01:20:17.572
Ari!

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:27.601
Ari! Come on!

01:20:48.324 --> 01:20:50.814
- Go! I'll cover you!
- We can make it!

01:20:50.894 --> 01:20:52.883
You can make it!

01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:56.020
Go!

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:02.392
<i>You can't escape.</i>

01:21:03.172 --> 01:21:05.369
<i>Come out and you won't be hurt.</i>

01:21:14.249 --> 01:21:15.887
Shit!

01:21:51.987 --> 01:21:53.866
Hands on the ground!

01:21:54.606 --> 01:21:56.147
Get down!

01:22:37.564 --> 01:22:39.454
Wait outside.

01:22:54.414 --> 01:22:56.272
Where is Sarraj?

01:22:59.185 --> 01:23:01.010
Retired.

01:23:11.164 --> 01:23:13.055
I'm not like Sarraj.

01:23:15.402 --> 01:23:17.425
Can't you see my wings?

01:23:27.414 --> 01:23:29.304
You're The Angel.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:34.540
Life is full of surprises, hmm?

01:23:35.087 --> 01:23:38.043
Sabri has been a friend of mine
for so many years...

01:23:38.123 --> 01:23:40.814
...the whole time, he was an Israeli spy.

01:23:41.694 --> 01:23:45.152
Still, you both have my gratitude
for protecting me.

01:23:45.832 --> 01:23:47.793
In return, I let...

01:23:47.873 --> 01:23:52.894
...the Jewish girl and Dr. Hamra
escape with their families.

01:23:57.009 --> 01:23:58.832
You work for us.

01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:03.234
No, no, we're enemies.

01:24:04.882 --> 01:24:07.211
I'm just an old soldier...

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:10.711
...who has seen too many children
die for nothing.

01:24:12.391 --> 01:24:16.581
Over the years, Miki and I have
helped each other...

01:24:17.361 --> 01:24:20.150
...when it was for our...

01:24:20.231 --> 01:24:22.503
...mutual benefit.

01:24:28.273 --> 01:24:30.295
Destroying Sarraj?

01:24:30.675 --> 01:24:32.198
Yes.

01:24:33.278 --> 01:24:36.327
Men like him, no matter where...

01:24:36.407 --> 01:24:38.904
...can't be allowed to grow.

01:24:38.984 --> 01:24:41.275
It would destroy my country.

01:24:56.768 --> 01:24:58.792
She didn't betray you.

01:25:01.035 --> 01:25:04.104
There was a track on her she wasn't aware of.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:14.005
Take it.

01:25:36.199 --> 01:25:38.150
Thank you.

01:25:43.413 --> 01:25:45.869
You weren't supposed to be caught.

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:01.036
It's me.

01:26:02.617 --> 01:26:05.837
He's alive and sitting in front of me.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.096
Of course.

01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:18.836
<i>Do you recognize my voice?</i>

01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:20.904
Yes.

01:26:20.984 --> 01:26:23.807
<i>What is the password for The Angel's house?</i>

01:26:24.587 --> 01:26:27.212
Caleb... home.

01:26:29.725 --> 01:26:33.316
<i>Don't worry,
everything is going to be all right.</i>

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:35.820
<i>Now, pass the phone back to him.</i>

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:46.213
I want my boys back, all of them.

01:26:46.613 --> 01:26:48.465
Of course.

01:26:49.153 --> 01:26:51.046
Usual rules?

01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:53.304
Agreed.

01:26:55.985 --> 01:26:58.643
I can't believe we're still doing this.

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:05.249
Yes.

01:27:07.862 --> 01:27:09.687
Goodbye, my friend.
