We have to give it

This Cup is the one chance
I have at getting my mom back.

to take temporary control
of this Institute.

Extra time is priceless.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.357
Of course.
You're a busy man.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.026
And I should find
this Lydia person.

Payment upfront is
just smart business.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.697

I haven't seen her.

But if I do,
I'll send her your way.

Meliorn?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.210
What are you doing here?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.679
The Clave called me in
for some kind of conference.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.015
I'm so happy to see you.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.683
Spare me.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.518

05:53.520 --> 05:54.953
you never wanted
to see me again.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.122

Despises Downworlders?

05:57.124 --> 05:59.224
That's common knowledge.
That's not true.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.060
And even if it were,
I'm not like that.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.329
I'm not here
to talk about us.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.566
I believe that's
your Clave envoy.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.402
Isabelle, please step aside.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.004
Meliorn, the Clave has
ordered that you be
placed under arrest.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.506
What?
What for?

06:14.508 --> 06:16.508
Soliciting state secrets
from a Shadowhunter

06:16.510 --> 06:18.710
on behalf of
Valentine Morgenstern.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.984
Have you lost your mind?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.320
You're lucky you weren't
arrested along with him.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.188
What are you
talking about?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.858
It's our understanding
that your long-standing
relationship

06:32.860 --> 06:34.559
with the Seelie, Meliorn,
may have led

06:34.561 --> 06:36.061
to the disclosure
of state secrets.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.329
What? No!

06:37.331 --> 06:39.931
Meliorn told me
how to get into
the Hotel DuMort

06:39.933 --> 06:41.366
so that we could
save a mundane.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.934
And you told him
nothing in return?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.271
Nobody is blaming
you for the attack.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.341
Meliorn and the Seelies
were likely working with
Valentine all along.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.411
Valentine has been
murdering Downworlders

06:52.413 --> 06:54.546
and draining their
bodies for months.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.749
He probably killed
those Seelie scouts
and used their blood--

06:57.751 --> 06:59.684
Do you have proof?
Do you?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.919
I have orders.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.388
That's all. I never
wanted any of this.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.591
I don't believe you
for a second.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.196
Simon is gonna hate me.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.864
Luke, I did
a terrible thing.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.433
It can't be undone.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.601
I found my way back,
your mother helped me.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.370
When he understands
that you're there for him--

07:18.372 --> 07:20.472
But how could he know that
if we can't find him?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.943
She calls Meliorn in
and arrests him,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.645
then acts like it's
all out of her hands.
[blows landing]

07:28.549 --> 07:29.881
You're gonna hurt yourself.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.385
I'm fine, Izzy.

07:33.387 --> 07:34.753
It was the Clave that gave
the order, not Lydia.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.121
Are you sure about that?

07:37.558 --> 07:40.425
Hey. You all right?

07:40.427 --> 07:42.427
[softly] I'm fine.
I just spoke to
Robert and Maryse.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.062
They're being
sent back to Idris.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.797
What?
Yeah.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.132
Another "order" from Lydia?

07:47.668 --> 07:48.767
Who's Lydia?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.335
She's in charge
of the Institute.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.436
She's what?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.271
Temporarily.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.440
And now she's convinced
the Clave that Mom and Dad
aren't doing their job?

07:55.442 --> 07:56.541
Well, maybe they aren't.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.444
The Institute was
under their control
when the Forsaken got in.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.445
What are you talking about?

08:00.447 --> 08:02.614
Mom and Dad were
members of the Circle.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.484
What? They don't
have Circle runes.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.253
That's because they made
a deal with the Clave
prior to the Uprising.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.122
In exchange for
their cooperation,
they were pardoned.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.858
You're questioning
their loyalty?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.326
Valentine is back.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.827
The Circle is rising.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.096
They're under suspicion.
[Jace] No way.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.631
Robert and Maryse
took me in.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.700
They raised me
as one of their own.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.701
I know what kind of
people they are.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.437
Are you sure?
They lied to us.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.872
For years, they've been
telling us how to act.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.507
That we have to uphold
the Lightwood name.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.842
Well, they're the ones
who tarnished it.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.010
They're hypocrites.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.346
You must be
Jace Wayland.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.284
Lydia Branwell.
You're quite the legend
back in Idris.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.687
Don't believe
everything you hear.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.989
Did you tell them?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.123
Tell us what?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.559
Lydia and I are engaged.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.928
We're getting married.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.832
You're not serious.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.300
You were supposed
to tell them "no."

08:56.637 --> 08:58.603
It's your life to ruin.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.575
Not sure what to say.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.644
How about,
"None of this matters"?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.013
We have to stop Valentine.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.147
Finally.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.982
Something we agree on.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.726
[Elaine] Simon, is that you?

09:25.499 --> 09:27.198
Oh, thank God.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.934
God, where have you been?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.403
Mom.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.105
[trembling]
I'm sorry, I was...

09:34.107 --> 09:35.907
I'm really happy to see you.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.343
Yeah, you and me both.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.412
[sighs]

09:40.414 --> 09:41.680
You can't worry me like that.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.915
Clary said you were okay,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.850
but I just kept picturing you
dead in a ditch somewhere.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.721
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.691
Please, just call me
next time and let me know.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.428
I just wanna know
you're okay. That's all.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.737
Simon!
[gasps]

10:05.739 --> 10:07.539
[Simon] Clary.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.274
Hi, Mrs. Lewis.
Hi.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.943
Oh, are you all right?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.681
Doesn't he look
so pale to you?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.720
Wait, what happened
to your glasses?
No, don't!

10:21.722 --> 10:23.722
[Clary] He's got contacts.
[panting]

10:23.724 --> 10:25.957
Okay, someone
needs to tell me
what is going on here.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.399
Mom... [gulps]
there's something I need to--

10:34.401 --> 10:35.767
Do for me.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.837
You won't believe this,
but my identity was stolen.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.072
Bank account hacked.
[sighing]

10:41.074 --> 10:43.575
Apparently,
I am not Clary Fray.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.910
Uh, that's awful.
It happened to me
last year, but...

10:47.614 --> 10:48.913
Clary, I don't think
he's well enough to go--

10:48.915 --> 10:51.683
Simon, we have always
been here for each other.

10:55.589 --> 10:56.721
I don't know.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.823
You know what, Clary?
I think maybe another time.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.759
Simon...

11:00.761 --> 11:03.762
I need you to
help me through this.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.603
Yeah.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.606
Are you sure, baby?

11:14.608 --> 11:16.675
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...

11:18.345 --> 11:20.645
[stuttering] You know how much
of a hypochondriac I can be.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.113
Clary?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.016
You take care of my boy.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.852
You know how much
he means to me.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.856
Okay, we should really go.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.859
I'll see you later, Mom.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.795
I'm holding you to that.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.697
And when you come home,

11:38.699 --> 11:42.734
you and I are gonna have
a serious discussion about
what's going on with you.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.705
Love you.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.742
I love you, too.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.912
[Robert] I need
a word with you, now.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.247
Were you planning
on telling us about

11:56.249 --> 11:58.149
your engagement
before we left for Idris?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.718
I'm marrying Lydia,
and now you know.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.420
I think you misunderstood
your mother's suggestion
that you marry.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.856
We wanted someone who
would help this family,
not destroy it.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.725
You think Lydia is
destroying this family?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.460
Not the fact that
you were in the Circle?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.597
You know?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.299
What did you think,
I'd never find out?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.935
All these years,
you never said anything.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.836
We couldn't.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.604
Is that the best
you can do?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.540
You drilled into me that
I was never good enough.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.742
It wasn't that.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.844
We wanted you to be
better than we were.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.612
You wanted to sweep
history under the rug.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.215
You wanted us to save you,
restore the Lightwood name.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.450
Alec, you're making
a mistake.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.119
No, I'm gonna fix
what you broke.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.754
And I'm gonna do it
on my terms.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.323
[sighing]

12:43.630 --> 12:44.796
[Simon] I feel sick.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.798
[Luke] Don't worry,
we'll get you what you need.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.066
I need this to stop.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.869
I've been there before.
It'll get better.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.771
I'll help you
through this.
No, you can't.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.474
Clary, I was
a regular guy.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.809
I had a life.
A regular life.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.611
And today...

13:01.948 --> 13:03.548
I almost tore
my mother apart.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.952
What if I do that to you?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.954
Simon, you won't.
Get away.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.626
Can you get the car?
Yeah.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.464
Once you feed--
Feed?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.400
Are you kidding?
That's what this is now?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.202
That's what my life's about?
Like I'm in a zoo?

13:25.071 --> 13:27.005
I'm... I am so sorry!

13:27.007 --> 13:29.174
Why are you so sorry,
Raphael did this to me.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.013
Simon, it was my choice.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.016
You died.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.351
Raphael brought you to us.
I had a choice.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.322
I could stake your heart
or I could...

13:44.324 --> 13:46.157
bury you,
and you could come back.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.526
[shudders]

13:49.496 --> 13:50.595
Oh...

13:51.298 --> 13:52.463
Clary, why?

13:52.465 --> 13:53.865
Because I love you, Simon.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.601
You call that love?
You brought me back to this?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.003
This nothing...

13:59.873 --> 14:02.006
where I feed, and I have
to hide from the sun,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.942
and I can't bear to be
by the people that I love?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.644
Did you ever think
about that, Clary?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.813
How I would feel,
what I would be?

14:08.815 --> 14:10.181
Simon, please understand--

14:10.183 --> 14:11.683
Just stay away from me.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.892
[Isabelle] This is insane.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.460
We have to put
a stop to this.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.230
Yeah, well, enjoy
Portaling back to Idris
with Mom and Dad.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.898
Meliorn is here
because of me.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.199
[Jace] Alec's right.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.168
There's nothing we can do
to stop this interrogation.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.970
You're on Alec's side now?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.005
We swore to
protect each other,
of course he's on my side.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.141
I'm not picking sides.
Jace Wayland is Switzerland.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.910
We have got to
find Valentine.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.378
Let's let this
play out, Izzy.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.614
Meliorn might have
some important information.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.683
[Lydia] <i> Forensics don't lie.</i>

14:45.685 --> 14:48.152
<i>Tell me what you know</i>
<i>about the blood</i>
<i>in the Forsaken.</i>

14:48.154 --> 14:50.922
Have you considered
that the blood
in the Forsaken

14:50.924 --> 14:52.924
came from our
dead scouts?

14:52.926 --> 14:55.326
Scouts sent to help you
hunt for Valentine.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.362
Why do you think
we would side
with a murderer?

14:57.364 --> 14:59.397
Seelies always
play both sides.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.833
You should talk
to your own people
about playing sides.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.167
Excuse me?

15:04.537 --> 15:07.872
You have no idea
what I'm talking about,
do you?

15:07.874 --> 15:11.342
If only Shadowhunters
had a better relationship
with us...

15:11.344 --> 15:13.077
Downworlders,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.813
you'd know that Valentine's
daughter has the Cup.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.084
Still think we should
let this play out?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.126
I'm pretty sure
that's not the cup
you're looking for.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.928
Give me a break, Wayland.
I'm just trying to do my job.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.697
Alec, call this off now.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.599
I guess Clary's bedroom
is in part of Switzerland?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.035
We can't call it off.
We have to find
the Mortal Cup.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.937
[man] It's all clear.
Of course it is.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.139
It's not here.
Let's keep looking.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.642
What is going on with you?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.811
Look, Jace, we have
to turn over the Cup.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.646
Alec, she's risked
everything to find it.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.281
And we've risked
everything for her.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.618
Either she gives
the Cup to Lydia,
or I'll do it myself.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.621
[sighs] I'll bring her back.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.125
But, please,
let Clary be the one to
give the Cup to the Clave.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.393
We owe her that much.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.228
It's the right call.
You'll see.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.137
[shutter clicks]

16:15.008 --> 16:16.641
[Clary sighs]

16:17.978 --> 16:19.510
Just drink.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.812
You can do it, Simon.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.013
[cell phone chimes]

16:24.150 --> 16:25.416
[ringing]

16:25.418 --> 16:27.418
[cell phone beeps]
Hey, what's with the picture?

16:27.420 --> 16:28.920
Draw it. Now.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.989
<i> It's a Blocking rune.</i>

16:30.990 --> 16:33.057
It prevents anyone
from finding you using
Shadowhunter tracking.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.860
You'll see, it'll get better.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.101
[winces]

16:43.103 --> 16:45.703
Clary, the Clave
heard you had the Cup.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.271
They think you're
working with Valentine.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.007
Oh, my God.
Why would they...

16:50.610 --> 16:52.710
Wait, Jace,
is the Cup secure?

16:52.712 --> 16:53.945
<i> It will be.</i>

16:53.947 --> 16:56.147
You need to get
to someplace safe.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.482
<i>Someplace the Clave</i>
<i>would never look.</i>

16:57.484 --> 16:58.950
<i> I'll find you.</i>

17:01.154 --> 17:02.053
We'll go to Jade Wolf.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.154
The Clave know
you like family.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.455
They'll look there first.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.458
[sighs] Simon,
we're going to see

17:07.460 --> 17:09.961
the one person
who can help us both.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.230
Have you lost your mind?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.732
A Shadowhunter
and a werewolf?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.167
You do know
this isn't a hotel?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.335
Technically, it is.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.671
Even starvation
can't shut you up.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.839
Look, we just need
someplace secure

17:21.841 --> 17:23.074
until we can
figure out a plan.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.977
These people never listen.
Don't bother. Let's go.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.245
You should put
a muzzle on that mutt.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.447
The fledgling can stay.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.250
But you aren't exactly
welcome after you

17:32.252 --> 17:34.052
barbecued half
a dozen of my people.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.853
Let's go, please.
I don't want
any part of this.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.755
Look, there isn't
any place else.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.659
You need Simon back, right?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.561
To prove Camille
broke the Accords.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.464
What good will he be
if he dies of starvation?

17:48.735 --> 17:52.170
Fine, but the stray
waits outside.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.440
If anything happens
to these two,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.275
you won't have to
wait till sun up,

17:57.277 --> 17:58.576
I'll kill you myself.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.777
Easy there, Fido.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.412
They'll be under
my protection.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.225
[Isabelle] Where
are you taking him?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.626
To a holding cell.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.396
And a guard unit
will transport him
to the Silent Brothers.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.265
You can't do that!
It's not our decision,
Isabelle.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.850
The Clave made the order.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.434
That could be
a death sentence
to a Downworlder.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.270
Are you trying to
start a war with them?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.306
Meliorn's told you
everything he knows.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.875
You don't know that.
Maybe we haven't asked
the right questions.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.211
Seelies often
skirt the truth.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.079
If he has information
on another terrorist attack,

18:35.081 --> 18:36.714
it is our responsibility
to get it.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.216
Let me talk to him.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.284
That wasn't exactly
helpful in the past.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.719
[Jace] But he may
not know anything.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.788
Alec, this is
going too far.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.490
We don't have a choice.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.225
And neither do we.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.227
Let me get this straight.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.129
You need Alec's stele
to open the safe,

18:51.131 --> 18:53.264
and you want me
to steal it from him?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.899
We prefer the word "borrow."

18:54.901 --> 18:56.134
Without his knowledge.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.103
No. No can do.
Not happening.

18:59.105 --> 19:03.274
Magnus, ever since Alec
found out our parents
were in the Circle,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.643
he's been messed up.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.179
He can't see
the big picture.

19:08.181 --> 19:11.282
If the Clave is willing
to subject Meliorn
to the Silent Brothers,

19:11.284 --> 19:14.318
if they're willing
to go this far...

19:14.320 --> 19:17.288
what do you think will happen
if they get the Cup?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.390
This affects everyone.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.294
Help us get into that safe.
Help us stop this.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.595
[sighs]

19:27.200 --> 19:28.699
You're both going to owe me.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.368
I'm talking 14th century.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.004
Gold, rubies...
definitely diamonds.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.373
And Alec can never know.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.141
That's a given.

19:37.143 --> 19:41.379
If we're going to do this...
there's no turning back.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.566
So this is your
idea of protection?

20:01.568 --> 20:04.235
It keeps you away
from my people,
and my people away from you.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.371
Give a shout
when you're hungry.

20:08.141 --> 20:11.509
Of course, you do have
a pretty decent snack
right here, no?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.011
Oh, silly me.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.248
I forgot... you two are
such great friends.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.284
Or has that changed?

20:31.764 --> 20:32.897
[grunting] Clary...

20:32.899 --> 20:35.433
you do not understand
how this is.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.869
[breathing heavily]

20:38.871 --> 20:40.238
[heart beating faintly]

20:40.240 --> 20:42.240
I can hear your heartbeat.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.776
I can smell the blood
in your veins.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.846
And I want it.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.118
Simon, I would not
blame you if you--

20:54.120 --> 20:56.120
What? Killed you?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.122
Don't you
understand anything?

20:58.124 --> 21:01.092
No, I don't. And I can't.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.628
But there has to be
a way for you to stay
in this world.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.331
Maybe what I did
was wrong and selfish,
but...

21:08.401 --> 21:10.368
my heart was breaking.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.402
[heart beating]

21:11.404 --> 21:12.603
I thought I was strong.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.939
I thought I was
a real Shadowhunter.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.376
Simon, when it comes to you,
I am still just Clary Fray.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.710
[heart beating loudly]

21:19.712 --> 21:22.213
And you are
still my best friend.

21:22.215 --> 21:26.050
I would rather
you tear me apart than
watch you die again,

21:26.052 --> 21:27.385
starving and angry--

21:27.387 --> 21:28.319
Raphael!

21:28.321 --> 21:30.354
[gasping]

21:32.158 --> 21:33.391
You ready now?

21:33.393 --> 21:34.892
Yes.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.829
Please!

21:38.831 --> 21:40.498
Here you go.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.376
It's all about presentation
and quality produce.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.647
You see, us vampires
look after one another.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.317
We take care
of our family.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.518
Simon already has a family.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.819
Had a family.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.456
That's all gonna change now.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.526
You're a Shadowhunter...
he's a vamp.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.265
You two will never be equals.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.167
You'll have to learn
that for yourself.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.771
<i> Hasta luego.</i>

22:30.550 --> 22:32.083
[wincing]

22:50.636 --> 22:52.069
[snaps fingers]

23:26.272 --> 23:29.774
All done for today.
[chuckles] Place is secure.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.509
Not bad for a day's work.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.779
I thought I'd see
how you were doing.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.651
I meant to thank you
for your advice.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.522
The whole...
"follow your heart" thing.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.757
Oh, well, what can I say?
[chuckles]

23:46.759 --> 23:50.194
I have a deep understanding
of the human psyche.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.196
At least, that's what
Freud always said.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.399
I'm getting married.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.567
Whoa! [chuckles]

23:56.569 --> 23:57.902
[stammers] That's
a tad sudden, isn't it?

23:57.904 --> 24:00.471
I mean, we should at least
go to dinner first--

24:00.473 --> 24:03.707
No, Magnus,
family is everything to me.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.609
You have to know that.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.144
I get it.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.580
You're part of a "Don't ask,
don't tell" culture.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.650
I'm fine with it.
You're a traditional guy.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.951
Yeah, I am.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.056
That's why I
proposed to Lydia.

24:20.726 --> 24:21.859
That's...

24:23.062 --> 24:24.328
interesting.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.864
[stutters] It makes sense.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.768
It's a solid partnership.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.570
For both of us.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.805
"Solid partnership."

24:34.807 --> 24:35.973
[snickers]

24:35.975 --> 24:38.075
[laughs]

24:38.077 --> 24:39.643
That's hot!

24:42.415 --> 24:44.048
Well, okay, then.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.650
Congratulations.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.453
Marriage is
a wonderful institution.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.921
Not that I would know.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.992
[inhales sharply]
Goodbye, Alexander.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.475
You might wanna
pick up the pace.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.311
You do not wanna be
on my bad side right now.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.513
Are you gonna be okay?

25:15.515 --> 25:17.715
The whole world is
turning upside down.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.717
Simon turned
into a vampire.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.452
Now Meliorn might die
because of some--

25:21.454 --> 25:22.720
It's not anything you did.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.389
They just put a bunch
of unrelated facts together,

25:25.391 --> 25:26.690
and came up with a big lie.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.692
I wish that made
me feel better.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.829
Where do you think
you're going?

25:31.831 --> 25:33.797
It's a very dangerous time,

25:33.799 --> 25:37.134
and no one is supposed
to leave the premises
without express orders.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.469
Hodge, we were
just about to--

25:38.471 --> 25:39.703
Lie to me?

25:39.705 --> 25:42.873
Clary needs us, Hodge.
The Clave is looking for her.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.909
She could be
in serious danger.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.246
Well, in that case,
I'd make a timely exit

25:49.248 --> 25:51.715
before anyone of importance
notices you're gone.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.952
We won't forget this.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.826
Hold it. Lydia...

26:05.531 --> 26:07.698
are you sure about this?

26:07.700 --> 26:10.200
Do you think I'd be
sending Meliorn
to the Silent Brothers

26:10.202 --> 26:11.802
if I thought
there was another way?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.638
[both sigh]

26:15.708 --> 26:19.577
You heard
about my fiance...
how he died.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.545
Yeah, it was
a demon attack in Rio.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.180
They never released
the details.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.750
We'd gotten intel about
a demon threat at Carnival.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.888
The demons were reportedly
at this club in the favela.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.557
But we had no idea
how many there were.

26:33.559 --> 26:38.195
We got word of
a warlock on their payroll,
so... we brought him in.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.764
My team wanted
to make him talk.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.399
Whatever it took,

26:42.401 --> 26:44.268
they were willing
to do, but...

26:44.270 --> 26:47.104
I wouldn't allow it.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.774
I just couldn't stand by
and watch the torture.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.776
You made a judgment call.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.113
It was the wrong call.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.715
We went in blind.

26:57.717 --> 27:01.719
And there had to
have been 100 demons.

27:02.722 --> 27:07.424
The whole raid went
sideways, and... John...

27:07.426 --> 27:08.926
[stammers]

27:08.928 --> 27:10.761
That's how he died.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.831
If only I just had the guts
to do what needed to be done.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.701
I can't make
that mistake again.

27:19.772 --> 27:23.540
We rule with our heads,
not with our hearts.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.143
Agreed.

27:28.814 --> 27:33.217
[sighs] I'm in.
Whatever you need.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.691
How are you feeling now?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.626
I'm drinking
blood, Clary.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.461
I know, Simon, but--

27:44.463 --> 27:46.430
I never wanted any part
of any of this.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.767
The whole Shadow World.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.435
Neither did I.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.270
At least you're
a superior being.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.407
I'm a Downworlder.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.346
Well... I don't wanna
bite you anymore.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.749
Well, that's good.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.686
Simon, what if I
brought you back

28:08.688 --> 28:10.788
because I wanted us
both to be different?

28:11.824 --> 28:15.292
I mean, suddenly I was
this new person, and...

28:15.294 --> 28:17.394
you were still living
in our old world.

28:18.497 --> 28:21.131
Maybe I...
I just couldn't fight
this deep need for--

28:21.133 --> 28:22.666
For us to be together.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.400
Yes.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.740
Look, I understand
if you hate me now.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.109
Be angry with you?

28:33.813 --> 28:34.978
Yeah.

28:36.849 --> 28:37.915
Hate you?

28:40.419 --> 28:41.785
Never.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.127
What's gonna happen to us?

28:51.030 --> 28:54.198
Luke and Raphael
can't stand each other.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.468
Every Downworlder seems
to despise Shadowhunters.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.037
Can't you see the divide?

29:00.039 --> 29:01.805
Not between us.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.674
No.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.479
Never.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.850
It appears
the cavalry has arrived.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.256
You'll wanna use
the back stairs.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.566
[Jace softly] Hey.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.934
Hey.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.836
Thank God you're okay.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.108
So this is your
safe hideout, huh?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.943
Well, you think the Clave
was gonna look here?

29:39.945 --> 29:41.779
Can we please focus
on the matter at hand?

29:41.781 --> 29:43.080
Unless no one here cares

29:43.082 --> 29:44.982
that the Clave is planning
on murdering Meliorn.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.817
[Clary and Simon] What?
They think Meliorn

29:46.819 --> 29:48.786
has more information
on Valentine and the
attack than he's saying.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.988
They're taking him
to the Silent Brothers.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.623
We have to stop them!

29:52.624 --> 29:54.257
That's the plan, Clary.
Rescue and recovery.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.727
We get him from the guards,
in and out, no one gets hurt.

29:56.729 --> 29:58.395
You want us to go up
against the Silent Brothers,

29:58.397 --> 30:00.264
and an elite
Shadowhunter guard unit?

30:00.266 --> 30:01.398
Without any backup?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.533
Pretty much sums it up, yeah.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.802
Is Alec coming?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.972
No. Not this time.

30:09.942 --> 30:13.010
If they're doing
this to Seelies,
no Downworlder is safe.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.180
But we can't go in alone,
not if we don't
want to be detected.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.148
My pack will track the unit,
create a distraction.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.919
I would suggest vampires,
but... I doubt
they'll cooperate.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.153
As much as I hate
to agree with Simon,

30:23.155 --> 30:25.489
vamps aren't exactly
team players.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.291
Let me talk to Raphael.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.426
I think I can persuade him.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.834
We're offering an alliance
with the Seelies.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.538
[sighing]
And the werewolves.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.309
Why should we believe you?

30:45.311 --> 30:48.779
You killed our people.
You violated our home.

30:48.781 --> 30:50.881
You kidnapped a mundane,
remember?

30:50.883 --> 30:52.316
That was me.
Look...

30:52.318 --> 30:54.351
you were just
following Camille's orders.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.887
She violated the Accords.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.956
You are a different
kind of leader.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.727
We are a new generation
of Shadowhunters.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.729
We believe everyone
can be equal.

31:05.731 --> 31:10.000
But we have to work together
to stop Valentine.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.269
And to ensure the Clave
doesn't repeat past mistakes.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.472
What do you say?

31:15.474 --> 31:18.075
This decision
requires a consensus.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.014
I vote yes.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.416
Well, well, well,
baby's first words.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.951
Don't make me regret them.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.555
If our newest member
pledges his loyalty
to his new leader

31:31.557 --> 31:33.523
and joins our clan...

31:33.525 --> 31:35.859
we'll all stand beside you.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.561
Simon's not a pawn.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.897
No... I'm not.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.935
But I accept your deal.
Simon, what are you doing?

31:44.937 --> 31:46.637
Whatever it takes
to protect the Downworld.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.172
It's my world now.

31:54.613 --> 31:55.913
Then we're in.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.102
[Clary] This does not look
like the City of Bones.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.271
[Jace] This is
the Downworlders entrance.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.273
The City of Bones has
a service entrance.
Perfect!

32:23.275 --> 32:25.943
I hope I have
better luck here
than I did last time.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.010
I'm just saying.

32:28.047 --> 32:28.946
Everyone knows
what to do?

32:30.616 --> 32:32.683
Text when you're
in position.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.785
[whistles]

32:35.554 --> 32:36.620
Stay.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.289
Good dog.
Bite me.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.158
Roll over.
Play dead.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.359
Boom!

32:46.398 --> 32:47.631
[hissing]

32:47.633 --> 32:48.732
[growling]

32:50.069 --> 32:51.835
Hey, enough! Enough!

32:51.837 --> 32:53.503
All our lives
are at stake!

32:53.505 --> 32:57.007
It's time we put
aside our differences,
and work together!

32:59.011 --> 33:01.545
Tonight we're
all Downworlders.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.246
Luke?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.017
Raphael?

33:15.361 --> 33:18.161
I guess I should expect
people to hate me
for who I am now.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.363
I'll get used to it.

33:19.365 --> 33:22.432
Never get used to it.
You hear me?

33:25.537 --> 33:26.870
Let's do this.

33:36.882 --> 33:39.149
We're risking everything,
aren't we?

33:39.151 --> 33:41.818
Going against the Clave,
against the other
Shadowhunters...

33:41.820 --> 33:44.054
Valentine's trying
to destroy the world, Clary.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.555
We're trying to protect it.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.890
[sighs]

33:47.993 --> 33:49.359
Before I forget...

33:50.696 --> 33:51.795
These belong to you.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.132
Did Alec give you these?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.901
[Jace] Let's just say
this is where they're safest.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.002
Be careful.

33:59.004 --> 34:00.337
Don't worry.
I won't activate it...

34:00.339 --> 34:02.439
[inhales deeply]
now that I know
how it works.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.174
Thank you.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.843
Thank me if we make it
out of this alive.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.212
[clicks tongue]
When we make it out.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.718
Right.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.552
So what are we thinking?
A little <i> encanto </i> action?

34:16.555 --> 34:18.155
You know there's
a rune for that.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.823
Of course there is.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.092
Just watch and learn
from the master.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.796
Remember...
no one gets hurt.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.645
Come here.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.818
[wincing]

35:01.800 --> 35:03.533
[Clary] Alec?
What's he doing here?

35:03.535 --> 35:05.135
Oh, no.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.645
Damn it.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.747
Lydia must have sent him.
Lydia?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.616
Alec's future wife.
Don't ask.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.952
Just say the word,
and we'll call
the whole thing off.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.888
No, there's no
turning back now.

35:24.890 --> 35:28.492
So whatever happens,
follow my lead.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.131
[indistinct growling]

35:37.302 --> 35:39.469
This could be a trap.
[growling]

35:40.839 --> 35:42.806
Secure the perimeter.
Do it now.

35:54.086 --> 35:55.652
I'll take Meliorn inside.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.254
Just stay here.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.488
Nobody gets through.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.735
[groans]

36:12.604 --> 36:13.770
[both grunt]

36:18.710 --> 36:21.211
Not too late to turn back.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.613
Quiet. I won't
tell you again.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.234
Alec.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.875
You told me you were
taking Clary back
to the Institute.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.376
You lied to me.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.578
I did what needed
to be done.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.413
Alec, the Clave
has gone too far.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.548
You have to see that.
Please, just let Meliorn go.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.317
I have my orders.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.686
You and your damn orders.
Who cares about orders?

37:02.688 --> 37:04.754
See?
That's how little you know
about being a Shadowhunter.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.423
You couldn't
possibly understand--

37:06.425 --> 37:08.225
[Jace] It's you that
doesn't understand, Alec.

37:08.227 --> 37:09.793
Not this time.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.197
I'm really sorry.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.298
[both grunting]

37:16.235 --> 37:18.068
[Jace] Clary,
Meliorn, go, now.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.672
You always broke the rules,

37:22.674 --> 37:24.608
but never the law,
not until she showed up.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.409
You've had it out for Clary
from the start.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.411
And now you're
getting married, Alec?

37:28.413 --> 37:30.013
We both know
what this is about.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.581
Oh, do we? Okay.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.050
Why doesn't the legend,
Jace Wayland,
tell us what's it about?

37:34.052 --> 37:36.853
It's about me!
It's about your feelings.
It's because you're--

37:36.855 --> 37:38.121
[both grunting]

37:57.776 --> 37:59.709
[both panting]

38:00.946 --> 38:02.379
Do it.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.513
Do it!

38:05.651 --> 38:08.551
I don't wanna be alive
if we're on different sides,
Alec.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.619
[gasping]

38:23.468 --> 38:24.968
Come with me.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.339
We'll fight Valentine
the right way... together.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.708
If we do that...

38:32.811 --> 38:35.512
we'll be considered traitors
like Mom and Dad.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.581
I'm begging you,
my <i> parabatai...</i>

38:38.583 --> 38:39.849
my brother.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.185
Please, Alec,
come with me.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.326
No.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.405
[inhales sharply]

39:11.016 --> 39:13.316
[Jace] Clary, we have to go.
Meliorn is a wanted man,

39:13.318 --> 39:16.419
we have to get him back
to the Seelie court
where he's protected.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.223
I wish you could
come with us.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.794
I've got a lot of
stuff to work on here.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.365
Like... controlling my
murderous tendencies.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.766
[laughs]

39:30.969 --> 39:33.069
We'll see each other soon.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.372
Before you know it.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.375
Simon, listen, I--

39:38.377 --> 39:40.176
What's done is done.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.546
I'm a vampire...
and you're a Shadowhunter.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.384
Maybe that's supposed
to mean something, but...

39:47.386 --> 39:49.085
[chuckles]
...you're still you.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.088
And I'm still me.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.491
Sort of.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.993
Enough... anyway.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.262
[softly] Simon.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.871
Let's work up
to hugging...

40:07.873 --> 40:10.507
because I haven't
had dinner yet.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.142
Sorry.
It's okay.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.415
Goodbye, Simon.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.999
Welcome home.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.444
I underestimated you.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.546
Is that a thank you?

40:49.548 --> 40:51.514
In the Seelie world,
it is.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.621
[clears throat]

40:58.623 --> 41:01.391
I hate to break up
this reunion, Izzy,
but we have to go.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.061
You're in good hands.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.730
I need to get back
to the Institute,

41:07.732 --> 41:09.599
see what hell
has broken loose.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.634
Try and talk some
sense into Alec.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.038
[sighs] Take care of him.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.207
We will.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.620
Isabelle told me
it was your idea to
rally the Downworlders.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.455
That you spearheaded
my rescue.

41:32.457 --> 41:33.990
Don't give me too much credit.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.392
Isabelle made this happen.
We just helped.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.862
She's being modest.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.598
You're a Shadowhunter now.

41:43.368 --> 41:46.936
I've been surprised
by more than one
Shadowhunter tonight.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.138
You risked everything
to unite us.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.140
Right after you tried
to sell her out.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.709
Not my finest moment.

41:53.678 --> 41:57.013
Which is why I'm
offering you a gift...
for your sacrifice.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.016
If you're ready...

42:01.286 --> 42:03.786
I can help you
find your father.
