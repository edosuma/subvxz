It's snowing!

00:34.120 --> 00:35.199
Look, Ollie!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The first snowflake of winter!

00:38.160 --> 00:40.080
I'm so happy for you, Moon!

00:40.239 --> 00:42.199
I know how you love snow.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.400
Luckily, I love laundry!

00:45.519 --> 00:47.919
Oh, I can't wait to wear my favourite hat!

00:48.199 --> 00:49.199
Have you seen it?

00:49.320 --> 00:52.400
The special one
made with Bolivian alpaca wool?

00:52.559 --> 00:54.279
Yep. It's in here somewhere.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.239
[Ollie] Nope, nope.
Uh... nope, nope, nope.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.720
There it is!
Allow me to present your favourite hat...

01:01.879 --> 01:03.919
squeaky clean!

01:04.080 --> 01:06.000
-Oh, no!
-What happened to it?

01:06.160 --> 01:07.679
How'd it get so tiny?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.000
It says...

01:09.119 --> 01:11.640
[mumbles]

01:11.800 --> 01:13.840
-What?
-Try this.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.320
"Wash in cold water to prevent shrinking."

01:18.479 --> 01:23.280
Oh, no!
I used hot water and caused shrinking!

01:23.440 --> 01:26.119
It's OK.
I'll stretch it back out to normal size!

01:30.160 --> 01:33.280
Oh, no, Moon!
I've ruined your favourite hat!

01:33.399 --> 01:36.160
It's OK, Ollie. It was an accident.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.199
Maybe I can still wear it.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.759
[sighs]

01:40.880 --> 01:43.399
No. It's too small.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.320
Goodbye, hat.

01:45.479 --> 01:48.759
I'll never forget
the snowmen we made together.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.320
Or the funny snow angels.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.320
Or the snow forts!

01:54.479 --> 01:57.199
Moon, I promise I'll find you another hat

01:57.360 --> 01:59.600
exactly like this special one!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.679
Let's go to the hat shop where you got it.

02:01.839 --> 02:03.280
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.640
-Are you sure?
-Yes. A promise is a promise.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.400
So, where's the shop?
Two or three blocks from here?

02:09.519 --> 02:11.039
I'll pack a small bag.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.960
The shop isn't in Brooklyn, Ollie.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.320
It's in Bolivia, South America.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.519
-But that's another country!
-Mmm-hmm.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.760
Another country...

02:21.920 --> 02:25.120
where we're going to find you another hat!

02:25.280 --> 02:26.959
I'm having a brainstorm!

02:27.120 --> 02:28.640
Let's go to Bolivia!

02:34.840 --> 02:35.920
Whoo!

02:37.320 --> 02:38.680
Whee!

02:45.320 --> 02:48.760
<i>Now arriving in Bolivia!</i>

02:57.320 --> 02:58.840
There's the shop where I got it!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.320
You relax,
and I'll look through all the hats

03:01.480 --> 03:02.959
till I find a match!

03:04.359 --> 03:08.840
Just one small thing I forgot to mention,
Ollie.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.320
This is the biggest hat shop in the world!

03:16.079 --> 03:19.440
That's a lot of hats to look through,
but no problem.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.320
Here goes! That's not it...
Nope... Nope... No.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.000
-No.
-No! Not the same.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.440
-That one's kinda close.
-No, Moon.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.000
I promised you the exact same hat!

03:32.160 --> 03:33.239
So that's what I'll get!

03:33.640 --> 03:36.040
No good. Nope.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.280
It's not... here!

03:39.280 --> 03:40.959
[parrot] Hello! Can I help you?

03:41.799 --> 03:46.280
Yes. Could you please help me
find a hat just like this one?

03:46.440 --> 03:50.600
Of course! I have a fantastic selection
of dolls' hats!

03:50.720 --> 03:53.000
Actually, I meant a regular-sized one!

03:53.200 --> 03:56.519
-This used to be a big hat.
-Oh, OK!

03:56.679 --> 03:58.119
Let me have a look at it.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.880
Aha! This one is made by...

04:04.079 --> 04:05.920
Esteban.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.839
Yes! Esteban...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.320
Who's... Esteban?

04:11.720 --> 04:14.399
[together] That's... Esteban.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.640
He's the world's best hat maker.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.519
I met him the day I bought my hat.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.399
We've been friends ever since!

04:20.519 --> 04:23.280
I'm afraid I don't have a single one
of his hats

04:23.440 --> 04:25.560
in that whole mountain of hats.

04:25.719 --> 04:28.400
-Now he tells me.
-They've all been bought.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.560
But I bet if you visit his workshop,

04:30.719 --> 04:33.159
he'll make a replacement, for a friend!

04:33.320 --> 04:36.520
Really? That's fantastic! Let's go!

04:36.760 --> 04:39.719
-Where's his workshop?
-Oh, it's not far.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.240
There's just one small thing.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.120
His workshop is up there.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.120
-On the mountainside?
-No...

04:49.280 --> 04:52.200
Oh, good.
Because you know I'm scared of heights.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.280
On the tippy top of the mountain.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.240
Oh.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.240
But I would never ask you to go up <i>there,</i>
Ollie.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.400
I'll just learn to love another hat...
somehow.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.960
No! A promise is a promise.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.120
-Anything for you, Moon!
-Really? Thanks, Ollie!

05:11.240 --> 05:14.360
It'll be great to see... Esteban.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.120
Now all we need is a llama!

05:17.280 --> 05:18.640
Llama?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.120
It was a good idea to get a llama

05:23.280 --> 05:25.360
to carry our stuff, huh, Ollie?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.120
[groans]

05:29.919 --> 05:34.400
-Was it?
-Sure. Llamas are very strong.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.000
I have to... agree with you!

05:38.120 --> 05:40.760
[groans]

05:43.120 --> 05:45.919
OK. We've gone as far as we can go...

05:46.080 --> 05:48.280
-Finally!
-..with the llama.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.880
-Now we climb.
-Climb? Up that?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.359
You're right.

05:55.479 --> 05:57.080
We should turn back.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.680
It's just a hat. I have my memories.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.479
No! I promised I'd replace your hat
and I will.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.640
How hard can it be, right?

06:07.120 --> 06:09.520
[groans]

06:12.479 --> 06:13.840
Do you mind?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.760
-Aaah!
-Wow! Good climbing, Ollie!

06:16.919 --> 06:19.680
He must really want to get my hat!

06:19.840 --> 06:21.680
[groans]

06:24.000 --> 06:25.760
-Wow!
-We made it!

06:25.919 --> 06:27.320
We finally made it!

06:27.760 --> 06:30.000
Hello? Hello!

06:30.159 --> 06:34.320
Hello. Are you looking for... Esteban?

06:35.359 --> 06:37.159
Yes! Is he here?

06:37.320 --> 06:38.719
No, I'm afraid not.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.120
He always spends the summer
in his summerhouse.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.280
But I don't understand. It's winter!

06:44.440 --> 06:48.159
Right. Just one small thing I forgot.

06:48.359 --> 06:51.479
When it's winter in Brooklyn,
it's summer in Bolivia.

06:51.599 --> 06:54.520
That's why Esteban isn't here.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.479
But...
but we hiked with an impossible llama

06:57.640 --> 06:59.039
and climbed this scary mountain

06:59.200 --> 07:01.799
and it was so hard... and he's not here?

07:01.960 --> 07:04.880
If you like,
I can take you to his summer house.

07:05.039 --> 07:08.880
I know where it is
and the easiest way to get there!

07:09.039 --> 07:11.239
You do? And it's easy?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.960
-Mmm-hmm.
-Then, yes. Please take us.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.280
Wonderful! Right this way!

07:16.400 --> 07:19.280
Just one small thing...

07:19.599 --> 07:21.359
[they scream]

07:21.520 --> 07:25.520
This is not a small thing!

07:28.960 --> 07:31.680
We're on the ground!

07:31.880 --> 07:34.440
Wait. What kind of ground is this?

07:34.880 --> 07:39.080
Salt flats!
Big areas of land covered in salt.

07:39.239 --> 07:42.200
After it dries,
you can put it on your fries!

07:42.320 --> 07:44.159
There's the house!

07:44.280 --> 07:47.320
-Have a groovy time.
-Thank you! Bye!

07:50.799 --> 07:52.000
Ah!

07:52.599 --> 07:55.960
Moon? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:56.120 --> 07:59.400
Amazing to see ya.
Love the dress. How's my hair?

07:59.560 --> 08:01.679
Hi, Esteban! Love the hair.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.840
Hi. Very nice.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.640
What a wild surprise!

08:05.799 --> 08:08.239
And this cat, he's got to be Ollie!

08:08.400 --> 08:09.719
Put it there, my man!

08:09.880 --> 08:11.640
Moon gabs about you all the time.

08:11.799 --> 08:14.560
How groovy is it to finally meet you?

08:14.679 --> 08:15.880
Uh... Somewhat?

08:16.039 --> 08:18.520
Esteban, we came all the way to see you

08:18.679 --> 08:22.080
because we have a tiny problem
with my hat.

08:22.239 --> 08:23.960
-What's that?
-It's tiny.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.840
This is one woolly situation.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.960
No doubt, I gotta make you a new one.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.400
-Oh, that's great!
-Thank you!

08:31.520 --> 08:33.439
Hey, hey, hey, hang on, hang on.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.600
There's just one small thing
you need to do...

08:36.760 --> 08:38.480
Another small thing?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.600
How small is <i>this </i>small thing?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.280
Tiny. Like the hat.

08:42.439 --> 08:46.199
All I need is for you
to walk over the clouds.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.480
What? But that's not a small thing!

08:49.600 --> 08:52.000
That's an impossible thing!

08:52.240 --> 08:55.079
Moon,
I know I promised to replace your hat.

08:55.199 --> 08:58.640
So I flew to Bolivia,
looked through a mountain of hats,

08:58.840 --> 09:00.360
climbed a real mountain,

09:00.520 --> 09:02.760
and even rode in a hot-air balloon!

09:02.920 --> 09:04.920
I would do anything to replace your hat,

09:05.079 --> 09:07.400
but I can't walk over clouds.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
No one can!

09:08.640 --> 09:11.800
I'm sorry, but I can't keep my promise.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.760
I think maybe you can.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.040
[Ollie] Whoa!

09:16.199 --> 09:19.199
It looks as if the clouds
are on the ground!

09:19.439 --> 09:23.959
Cool, right? The salt flats
reflect the sky like a mirror!

09:24.120 --> 09:27.319
Is that what you meant
by walking over the clouds?

09:27.480 --> 09:28.920
You got it.

09:29.079 --> 09:32.000
My workshop is on the other side
of the big salt flat.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.480
That's where I'll make a new hat
for our friend Moon.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.800
Moon, let's walk over the clouds!

It's perfect! What do you think, Ollie?

10:17.400 --> 10:20.640
It looks fantastic and super warm!

10:20.760 --> 10:23.160
Just one small thing.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.160
-Yes?
-Yes?

10:24.640 --> 10:28.160
-Can I have one, too?
-I thought you might say that.

10:28.319 --> 10:29.959
[Ollie] Ah! You're the best!

10:33.160 --> 10:35.880
Ready to make a snowman in our new hats,
Ollie?

10:36.040 --> 10:38.120
Just a second.
I'm looking for our mittens.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.240
Nope, nope, nope...

10:42.400 --> 10:45.920
[gasps]
Oh, no, Moon! I ruined our mittens!

10:46.360 --> 10:50.160
You know, Moon. From now on,
maybe you should do the laundry.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.760
Wouldn't it be easier
if we went back to Bolivia?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.959
-Yep.
-Definitely!

10:56.079 --> 10:59.120
[laughter]

11:00.120 --> 11:06.400
