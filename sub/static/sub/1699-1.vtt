WEBVTT

00:11.270 --> 00:13.734
Eddie?!

00:13.735 --> 00:16.129
Hello?!

00:18.830 --> 00:21.404
And now,
introducing the newest member

00:21.405 --> 00:23.408
of Bayside's basketball team...

00:23.409 --> 00:27.653
Starting guard
Eddie nothing-but-net Thomas.

00:30.141 --> 00:31.311
Three seconds.

00:31.312 --> 00:33.123
Thomas charges down the floor.

00:33.124 --> 00:36.059
Makes his move,
jumps to the rim... yes!

00:36.060 --> 00:38.780
Yes. Thomas wins
the championship

00:38.781 --> 00:41.669
and the crowd goes wild!

00:44.610 --> 00:46.915
Congratulations, Eddie,
you made the team.

00:46.916 --> 00:47.901
I'm so happy for you.

00:47.902 --> 00:48.623
Thank you, thank you.

00:48.624 --> 00:50.129
And now the crowd
can stop hugging.

00:51.030 --> 00:52.674
That's right...

00:52.974 --> 00:54.678
High-five.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.239
Home doggie; all right.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.012
So, when did you find out?
This morning.

00:59.013 --> 01:01.023
Coach said I'm starting guard
for the rest of the season.

01:01.024 --> 01:03.527
I'll just have to pull at least
a C-plus on all my midterms.

01:05.114 --> 01:06.447
Right on.

01:12.147 --> 01:13.717
An "F"?

01:17.846 --> 01:19.056
Wait, wait, wait.

01:19.057 --> 01:20.398
Did you have a vision?

01:21.077 --> 01:23.374
Did it have anything to do
with me dating a cheerleader

01:23.375 --> 01:25.951
and another cheerleader?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.161
Eddie, I have visions,
not fantasies.

01:31.513 --> 01:33.338
Okay.

01:33.339 --> 01:36.187
But, you know, it wasn't really
anything that important.

01:36.188 --> 01:38.341
Man, this is the best day
of my life.

01:38.342 --> 01:40.036
Nothing can stop me now.

01:41.084 --> 01:43.547
Yeah, right... nothing.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.269 --> 02:35.004
Yep, that's me.

02:41.634 --> 02:43.640
So, if Eddie gets an "F"
on his test

02:43.641 --> 02:45.043
he'll get kicked
off the team.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.633
I know I have to tell him

02:47.634 --> 02:49.135
but he was so psyched
about being on that team.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.475
I just don't know how.

02:52.574 --> 02:55.500
Yes, I'm sure
it was Eddie's test.

02:55.501 --> 02:56.938
He was holding
it in his hand

02:56.939 --> 02:58.748
and I remember the right
answers were circled

02:58.749 --> 02:59.913
like "D, A, B, A."

02:59.914 --> 03:01.089
I remembered
because it spelled

03:01.090 --> 03:02.931
"Daba, B, B, Caba, C, C

03:02.932 --> 03:04.896
Bad, Dad, D, D, Caba..."

03:04.897 --> 03:06.175
Raven...!

03:07.048 --> 03:09.538
I know. I have the answers
to Eddie's test.

03:09.539 --> 03:12.538
No, you said, "Dede."
That's my aunt's name.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.114
Do you know what this means,
Chelsea?

03:19.115 --> 03:21.353
I can give the answers to Eddie

03:21.354 --> 03:23.387
he'll get an "A"
on the Spanish midterm

03:23.388 --> 03:24.890
and then he won't get
kicked off the team.

03:24.891 --> 03:26.622
You're right.
You should tell him.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.238
Yeah, but that would be
cheating; I can't do that.

03:28.239 --> 03:30.115
You're right. There's no way
you could tell him.

03:30.116 --> 03:32.178
If I don't,
he'll get kicked off the team.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.351
You should tell him.

03:33.352 --> 03:35.132
Oh, now you believe in cheating?

03:35.133 --> 03:37.862
Well, then don't tell...
what do you want from me?

03:39.236 --> 03:41.018
I want you to be the one
who's psychic

03:41.019 --> 03:44.118
so I can be the one saying:
"So, what are you going to do?"

03:46.124 --> 03:47.845
So, what are
you going to do?

03:50.795 --> 03:52.498
Okay, Max, we going to need
some nicknames

03:52.499 --> 03:54.090
now that we on the team.

03:54.091 --> 03:55.796
Like, uh, the Mailman or Shaq.

03:55.797 --> 03:57.428
Okay, um...

03:58.208 --> 03:59.576
I'll be Shaq.

04:01.524 --> 04:03.615
Don't tell me
it's already taken.

04:04.764 --> 04:08.198
Hey, Eddie, don't you have
a Spanish midterm tomorrow?

04:08.199 --> 04:09.293
Yeah.

04:09.294 --> 04:11.423
So, um, how are you
doing in that class?

04:11.424 --> 04:13.964
Okay. I mean, I'll probably
pull off, like, a C-plus.

04:17.394 --> 04:19.293
Okay, Eddie, listen...

04:20.464 --> 04:22.796
Hey, Max,
can't we get a minute?

04:22.797 --> 04:24.692
Uh, sure.

04:24.693 --> 04:26.081
Oh... What...?

04:27.554 --> 04:30.016
Um... so, uh, what did you
want to talk to me about?

04:31.779 --> 04:34.629
Well, you know, I just wanted
to talk to Eddie alone, really.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.267
Well, he's
right over there.

04:36.268 --> 04:37.836
What are you
talking to me for?

04:41.790 --> 04:43.337
Guess I wasn't thinking.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.335
I have those days sometimes.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.706
I bet you do.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.077
Eddie, listen...

04:58.078 --> 04:59.969
you really have to concentrate
on those grades.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.205
You know
you got to keep it up.

05:01.206 --> 05:03.066
I know, I know.
Look... I'll study tonight.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.593
I meeting the guys over at Max's
house to watch the game.

05:05.594 --> 05:08.367
Hey, why go out
and have fun with the guys

05:08.368 --> 05:11.477
when... when you can come over
to Raven's for a study party?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.879
Yeah, now that is cool.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.594
Yeah.

05:13.595 --> 05:14.723
Maybe, then, afterwards

05:14.724 --> 05:16.444
we can sit around
and do each other's toenails

05:16.445 --> 05:18.392
and share our feelings.

05:20.024 --> 05:21.993
Yeah.

05:21.994 --> 05:23.557
No, no, no.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.042
I mean, it's not like
you had a vision of me

05:26.043 --> 05:27.490
failing a test
or something.

05:30.252 --> 05:31.423
Did you?

05:31.424 --> 05:33.023
Sorry, Eddie.

05:33.388 --> 05:35.560
Oh, man, I can't get an "F"

05:35.561 --> 05:36.693
on this test.

05:36.694 --> 05:38.043
I'll get kicked off the team.

05:38.044 --> 05:39.323
Hey, Eddie,
don't panic, okay?

05:39.324 --> 05:41.328
You always cram the night before
and get a good grade.

05:41.329 --> 05:43.098
Which, by the way,
is so irritating.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.205
Do you know how
hard I work...

05:44.206 --> 05:46.298
Chelsea, Chelsea...
focus, focus.

05:47.516 --> 05:49.490
I can cram all I want to, y'all.

05:49.491 --> 05:50.814
I just don't get Spanish.

05:50.815 --> 05:51.921
You know what, Eddie?

05:51.922 --> 05:54.078
We are not going to let this
vision come true, okay?

05:54.079 --> 05:54.987
'Cause you know why?

05:54.988 --> 05:56.570
We both took Spanish
last year

05:56.571 --> 05:58.833
and, you know, not to brag,
but we both did...

05:59.494 --> 06:00.999
Excelente.
Excelente.

06:06.764 --> 06:09.055
That's "excellent" in Spanish.

06:10.074 --> 06:12.220
Then why don't
they just say that? I...

06:18.224 --> 06:20.892
All right, contestant, are you
ready to play another round of

06:20.893 --> 06:23.342
"Do you want to pass
Spanish?"

06:23.343 --> 06:24.861
Yes, I am, Raven.

06:26.414 --> 06:27.404
All right.

06:27.405 --> 06:29.320
In the last round,
you've managed

06:29.321 --> 06:33.793
to correctly label, in Spanish,
amount of zero items.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.096
But...

06:35.097 --> 06:36.527
you can stop now

06:36.528 --> 06:40.100
or you can push on
to actually learn something.

06:41.570 --> 06:42.939
I'd like to learn something.

06:44.429 --> 06:45.940
All right, Chelsea

06:45.941 --> 06:48.091
let's tell Eddie
and the folks at home

06:48.092 --> 06:49.086
what he's playing for.

06:49.087 --> 06:50.106
All right, Raven.

06:50.107 --> 06:52.706
Eddie will be playing for
an ice-cold root beer.

06:52.707 --> 06:55.902
Yes, courtesy of
your mom and dad.

06:55.903 --> 06:58.376
Yes, your mom and dad.

06:59.624 --> 07:01.064
Makers of you and Corey.

07:02.724 --> 07:04.898
All right... ready...

07:04.899 --> 07:06.180
Set...

07:06.506 --> 07:07.719
Go!

07:22.977 --> 07:24.081
You guys are right.

07:24.082 --> 07:26.123
This is a cool way to learn
Spanish.

07:26.124 --> 07:30.098
All right, Chelsea,
let's tell him how he did.

07:30.099 --> 07:32.856
Well, on the bright
side, um, Eddie

07:32.857 --> 07:35.450
you knew that "teléfono" meant,
you know, telephone.

07:35.451 --> 07:37.478
# Go, Eddie, it's a party #

07:37.479 --> 07:39.076
# Shake your booty now. #

07:39.829 --> 07:41.575
Oh, but, contestant

07:41.576 --> 07:43.130
that's where your luck ran out

07:43.131 --> 07:46.224
because, you see,
we don't cook in the "garbage."

07:47.924 --> 07:49.686
And we don't sit

07:49.687 --> 07:50.790
on a shoe.

07:51.624 --> 07:53.658
Oh, while your sitting
on that shoe

07:53.659 --> 07:55.328
you can have a nice, cold

07:55.329 --> 07:56.694
glass of tuna.

07:57.564 --> 07:58.944
Would you stop doing that?

08:01.611 --> 08:03.056
Dad said these guys

08:03.057 --> 08:04.463
got to go; it's getting late.

08:04.464 --> 08:06.968
Can you please tell him
another 15 minutes?

08:06.969 --> 08:09.315
Eddie's got a really important
Spanish test tomorrow.

08:09.316 --> 08:11.032
Spanish?

08:12.764 --> 08:14.738
That's why you've been here
all night?

08:24.564 --> 08:26.740
Estúpido! Estúpido! Estúpido!

08:29.647 --> 08:32.158
It's no way I'm going
to get this stuff by tomorrow.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.857
Maybe if I had
a couple of more days...

08:33.859 --> 08:35.751
Eddie, don't
give up, okay?

08:35.753 --> 08:36.393
'Cause we're not.

08:36.394 --> 08:38.158
I want you to go inside
the living room

08:38.159 --> 08:39.727
so we can make up
some more cards.

08:39.729 --> 08:41.764
Go... go.

08:45.494 --> 08:46.798
What are we going
to do, Chelsea?

08:46.799 --> 08:47.798
He is not getting it.

08:47.799 --> 08:48.599
I know.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.965
Maybe, you should
tell him that you saw...

08:49.966 --> 08:51.031
Oh, that I saw
the Big Dipper

08:51.032 --> 08:52.209
and, you know,
the lunar eclipse...

08:52.210 --> 08:53.138
Oh, no, no, no.

08:53.139 --> 08:54.946
I meant, tell him
that you saw the answers.

08:54.947 --> 08:56.918
You saw the answers, Rae?

08:58.064 --> 09:01.828
Yeah, that was, uh, kind of the
part of the vision I left out.

09:01.829 --> 09:04.059
This is great.
So, where are they?

09:04.060 --> 09:05.328
What? You got them
written down or what?

09:06.812 --> 09:08.304
Eddie, that would be cheating

09:08.305 --> 09:09.723
and I just can't
help you do that.

09:09.724 --> 09:13.324
I know, but can't you think
of it as psychic tutoring? I...

09:15.485 --> 09:17.579
I'm sorry, I just can't.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.663
Wait a minute.

09:20.411 --> 09:21.611
So, you mean to tell me

09:21.612 --> 09:23.128
that you're just
going to let me fail

09:23.129 --> 09:24.524
and get kicked off
the team?

09:25.564 --> 09:26.603
I mean, you know how many guys

09:26.604 --> 09:28.980
have tried out, Rae,
and I made the cut?

09:29.663 --> 09:31.028
That's makes me
something around here.

09:31.029 --> 09:31.928
I know, Eddie, but...

09:31.929 --> 09:32.810
Just forget it.

09:32.811 --> 09:33.623
You know, it's not

09:33.624 --> 09:35.193
that easy for me, either.

09:35.194 --> 09:39.302
Poor Raven. It must be so hard
knowing stuff before it happens.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.228
I thought you were my friend.

09:44.229 --> 09:45.394
I am.

09:46.494 --> 09:47.920
That's the wrong answer.

10:00.294 --> 10:01.294
Hey, Eddie.

10:04.731 --> 10:06.393
Can you believe him?

10:06.815 --> 10:09.333
I wish I never had
that stupid vision.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.738
There's nothing
you can do now, Rae.

10:10.739 --> 10:12.010
His test
is in an hour.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.972
Hola, Ricardo,
Hola, Miguel.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.029
I hope you're ready
for the big test today.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.701
I am. But then,
I know the answers.

10:23.064 --> 10:25.502
Maybe there is something
I can do.

10:30.094 --> 10:32.598
Ah-ah-ah.
You missed a spot.

10:33.481 --> 10:34.925
You missed a spot!

10:36.464 --> 10:37.764
Still there.

10:39.894 --> 10:41.364
Still there.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.095
Okay, all gone.

10:48.642 --> 10:49.868
Senorita Rodriguez.

10:49.869 --> 10:51.731
Raven!

10:51.732 --> 10:52.663
You got a minute?

10:52.664 --> 10:54.463
I haven't seen you all year.

10:54.464 --> 10:56.864
You have a little something
right here.

10:57.864 --> 10:58.864
Still there.

11:00.194 --> 11:01.464
Still there.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.810
Okay, all gone.

11:04.811 --> 11:06.052
What can I do for you?

11:06.053 --> 11:08.512
I have something really important
I need to tell you.

11:08.513 --> 11:10.207
Some of your students
are worried

11:10.208 --> 11:12.464
about how hard the midterm test
is going to be today.

11:12.465 --> 11:13.552
What can I tell you?

11:13.553 --> 11:15.235
Spanish is not
for sissies.

11:15.236 --> 11:16.538
Don't I know it.

11:16.539 --> 11:17.423
But it's just that

11:17.424 --> 11:19.703
some of them are thinking
that they might even switch

11:19.704 --> 11:21.824
to French.

11:22.496 --> 11:23.403
What?!

11:25.209 --> 11:28.616
I bet that new French teacher,
Madame What's Her Face

11:28.617 --> 11:29.415
is behind this.

11:29.416 --> 11:31.185
I don't trust
that woman.

11:31.564 --> 11:33.763
She's about as French
as French fries

11:33.764 --> 11:36.236
and yet she prances
around with her croissants

11:36.237 --> 11:39.195
and her international coffee
like she's all that.

11:42.314 --> 11:43.113
I was just saying

11:43.114 --> 11:43.958
that I think you need

11:43.959 --> 11:45.977
to give your students a little bit
more time to study.

11:45.978 --> 11:48.119
You know, you could always
postpone the test till Monday.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.460
Postpone the test... hmm.

11:50.461 --> 11:51.461
So you'll do it?

11:51.462 --> 11:52.225
No.

11:53.394 --> 11:55.346
They'll just have to do
the best they can.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.594
Adios, Raven.

12:00.757 --> 12:03.067
Senorita, can you tell him
he's going to have

12:03.068 --> 12:04.263
to do that one again?

12:15.778 --> 12:17.798
I got to get to class,
but don't forget

12:17.799 --> 12:19.196
team pictures on Monday.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.874
Yeah, at least I'll have
something

12:20.875 --> 12:22.270
to prove
I was on the team.

12:24.725 --> 12:26.197
Dang! Stupid ball!

12:26.198 --> 12:28.893
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

12:28.894 --> 12:31.145
Turn it on it's side.

12:37.264 --> 12:38.793
That's funny.

12:38.794 --> 12:40.875
Worked for my football.

12:40.876 --> 12:43.676
Give me.
Go, Max. Go.

12:44.124 --> 12:45.012
Bye, Max.

12:46.102 --> 12:47.958
Hey, Eddie, can we talk?

12:47.959 --> 12:49.085
Wait, wait, wait.

12:49.086 --> 12:52.486
I thought I heard
a former friend of mine.

12:58.464 --> 13:00.898
I got a Spanish test to fail.

13:00.899 --> 13:02.565
Might as well take this.

13:02.566 --> 13:04.164
I won't be needing it.

13:06.264 --> 13:07.539
Eddie, wait!

13:09.594 --> 13:11.128
I'll give you
the answers.

13:11.129 --> 13:12.123
You will!

13:12.124 --> 13:13.498
I knew you'd come through
for me!

13:13.499 --> 13:14.663
What are they?

13:14.664 --> 13:15.823
They're D, A, B, A, C...

13:15.824 --> 13:18.211
Slow down, slow down.
D, A, B, A... what?

13:19.274 --> 13:20.887
I'll write 'em down
for you, here.

13:22.464 --> 13:24.571
You got my back
on this one, Rae.

13:24.572 --> 13:26.735
I mean, if you ever need
anything like a kidney

13:26.736 --> 13:28.429
I will personally...

13:29.185 --> 13:30.358
find someone
to donate it to you.

13:30.359 --> 13:31.994
That's all I can do.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.826
At least he's happy.

13:37.827 --> 13:39.898
He didn't give you
much a choice, right?

13:39.899 --> 13:42.207
Hola, Chelsea,
hola, Raven.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.383
I thought about
what you said

13:43.384 --> 13:45.398
about the students switching
to French.

13:45.399 --> 13:46.693
I can't let that happen.

13:46.694 --> 13:49.301
So you're postponing the test?

13:49.302 --> 13:51.625
No. But I decided to make

13:51.626 --> 13:53.109
Spanish more fun.

13:53.110 --> 13:56.607
So I made a whole new test
with all new questions.

13:56.608 --> 13:58.871
Oh! Is it any easier?

13:59.885 --> 14:00.808
No.

14:02.194 --> 14:08.038
But I printed it on pink paper,
and that says fun to me. Adios.

14:13.464 --> 14:14.923
Miss Senorita

14:14.924 --> 14:16.360
I have a message
from the office

14:16.361 --> 14:17.526
for Mr. Eddie Thomas.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.003
Raven, he's about
to take a test.

14:19.004 --> 14:21.324
I understand that,
but it's really important.

14:21.325 --> 14:22.806
Here, I'm going to let you in
on the secret.

14:22.807 --> 14:24.799
His uncle Louie
is in the hospital

14:24.800 --> 14:27.998
and see, what had happened
was he got the wrong test.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.179
So what happened

14:29.180 --> 14:32.715
is they gave him
a completely wrong test.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.055
Do you understand that, Eddie?

14:34.056 --> 14:37.061
Your uncle Louie has
completely the wrong test.

14:37.062 --> 14:38.151
Comprende?

14:39.051 --> 14:40.552
I don't have an uncle Louie.

14:41.801 --> 14:43.367
It must be a mistake.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.372
A mistake?
I must have the wrong information.

14:46.373 --> 14:47.974
It's funny how people
can get mixed up

14:47.975 --> 14:49.995
and get the wrong information.

14:49.996 --> 14:51.147
I think you need
to tell him

14:51.148 --> 14:52.268
because he's not comprendeing.

14:52.269 --> 14:55.087
The wrong information.

14:55.088 --> 14:58.469
Raven, Eduardo obviously
doesn't care about his uncle

14:58.470 --> 14:59.470
so bye-bye.

14:59.471 --> 15:00.806
Okay.

15:01.871 --> 15:05.088
All right, class,
start your test, okay?

15:06.286 --> 15:10.430
You have until the end
of my Ricky Martin CD.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.794
And... go.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.728
# I got a B, I got an A #

15:17.729 --> 15:19.163
# I got a B, D, D #

15:19.164 --> 15:21.422
# I got a C, I got a A,
I got a B, D, D. #

15:22.120 --> 15:24.892
# And I most definitely
ain't got no F. #

15:30.494 --> 15:33.260
Remind me again
why we're risking detention.

15:33.261 --> 15:35.564
Girl, we are not going
to get detention, okay?

15:35.565 --> 15:39.574
I mean, if we get caught up here
we're talking expelled.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.736
Don't worry, Chelsea.

15:43.737 --> 15:46.843
All we go to do
is get Eddie to see the sign

15:46.844 --> 15:47.854
then we'll be all right.

15:47.855 --> 15:48.711
Now, where is it?

15:48.712 --> 15:50.767
I taped it
to the railing like you told me.

15:52.271 --> 15:53.963
Oh, that's good, Chelsea.

15:53.964 --> 15:55.848
Now all we have to do
is get Eddie

15:55.849 --> 15:57.003
onto the other side
of the street

15:57.004 --> 15:58.399
so he can read the sign.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.458
Hey, Chelsea.

16:07.459 --> 16:08.493
What?

16:08.494 --> 16:11.792
Tell me there
is not a bird

16:12.599 --> 16:13.645
on my head.

16:14.943 --> 16:17.010
Okay, now Rae, don't move.

16:17.011 --> 16:19.383
Don't scare it, because
you know what pigeons do

16:19.384 --> 16:20.310
when they're scared.

16:20.311 --> 16:22.398
Get it off my head, Chelsea.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.859
Get it off my head.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.798
Hey, bird, shoo!
Fly away, little bird.

16:26.799 --> 16:28.963
Fly away.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.153
Bye, little birdie.
Bye-bye, sweetie!

16:31.154 --> 16:32.719
Hey, look,
there's Eddie.

16:40.288 --> 16:41.615
Okay, you're not
paying attention.

16:41.616 --> 16:43.399
Chelsea, I think
we better go low.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.930
Go lower.

16:44.931 --> 16:46.394
Okay, okay.

16:58.464 --> 16:59.745
Chelsea!

17:05.329 --> 17:08.066
You okay?
You okay?

17:10.094 --> 17:13.997
Chelsea, hold onto the rope!

17:14.512 --> 17:17.336
Ow! Ow!
That's my leg!

17:20.717 --> 17:22.498
Get the rope!
Get the rope!

17:22.499 --> 17:23.493
You got it?!

17:33.677 --> 17:36.402
Don't you think, you know,
Eddie's smart just a little bit?

17:38.494 --> 17:40.090
Eddie, got up.

17:40.091 --> 17:42.969
You're through early, Eduardo.

17:44.717 --> 17:48.158
But you know, Spanish just comes
easy to a brother.

17:48.159 --> 17:49.724
Tienes muchas suerte.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.524
Uh, salsa.

17:59.476 --> 18:00.655
Oh, on second thought

18:00.656 --> 18:03.275
it never hurts
to double-check your work.

18:03.276 --> 18:04.765
Would you mind if I open
up a window?

18:04.766 --> 18:05.542
It's kind of hot in here.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.646
Go ahead.

18:13.964 --> 18:15.438
What are you doing?

18:15.939 --> 18:16.980
You've got the...

18:18.341 --> 18:19.593
...wrong answers.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.732
Your teacher...

18:22.835 --> 18:24.320
...she changed the test.

18:24.321 --> 18:25.766
What?

18:26.344 --> 18:27.508
She'll make us...

18:27.509 --> 18:29.467
take it again.

18:29.468 --> 18:31.598
What am I going to do?
I don't know this stuff.

18:31.599 --> 18:32.773
Just do...

18:33.981 --> 18:35.170
the best...

18:36.445 --> 18:38.034
you can.

18:38.805 --> 18:41.218
Eduardo, ciero la ventana.

18:41.559 --> 18:42.784
What did she say?

18:42.785 --> 18:44.574
Close the window!

18:49.294 --> 18:50.473
Oh, okay!

18:50.474 --> 18:52.509
Hey, Chelsea, Chelsea.

18:52.510 --> 18:54.207
What are you doing?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.904
I'm not doing
anything, Chelsea.

18:59.584 --> 19:01.163
The Principal is.

19:01.164 --> 19:03.863
Hi, Principal Perkins.

19:04.982 --> 19:06.503
We'll be right up, all right?

19:06.504 --> 19:07.864
How's that view?

19:24.354 --> 19:26.696
Hey. So, uh,
how'd the test go?

19:27.259 --> 19:28.421
I don't know.

19:28.422 --> 19:30.229
The whole thing
was kind of a blur.

19:31.224 --> 19:33.264
How'd your meeting
with the principal go?

19:33.265 --> 19:35.369
Oh, that was kind
of a blur, too.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.146
A really loud, angry blur.

19:40.378 --> 19:41.844
I wouldn't even be in this mess

19:41.845 --> 19:43.458
if I didn't ask you
to help me cheat.

19:43.886 --> 19:45.294
I'm sorry, Rae.

19:45.594 --> 19:48.647
And all that stuff I said
about you being a bad friend

19:49.949 --> 19:51.358
well, that was out of line.

19:51.359 --> 19:52.763
That's okay.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.795
I know being on the basketball
team means a lot to you

19:56.796 --> 19:59.598
but you got a lot more
going on for you than just that.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.030
Yeah, right.

20:01.031 --> 20:02.393
Yeah, right!

20:02.394 --> 20:06.140
I mean, you are
the best rapper that I know.

20:06.141 --> 20:08.095
Well, you're not lying there.

20:08.096 --> 20:09.490
I am pretty tight.

20:10.235 --> 20:12.500
And funny.
You're always cracking me up.

20:12.501 --> 20:13.687
And generous.

20:13.688 --> 20:16.182
You always split your lunch
with me when I forget mine.

20:16.947 --> 20:18.945
Actually, Rae,
that's Chelsea.

20:22.028 --> 20:23.588
Well, I know
one thing's for sure.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.523
If I was in
that Spanish class

20:25.524 --> 20:28.258
you'd be the one outside
the window helping me.

20:28.259 --> 20:30.324
Me? No way.

20:35.649 --> 20:36.779
In a second.

20:39.908 --> 20:41.798
You know that psychic
thing you've got going on?

20:41.799 --> 20:43.763
I always thought
it'd be kind of fun

20:43.764 --> 20:46.428
but it must get pretty tough
to deal with sometimes, huh?

20:47.528 --> 20:48.796
Sometimes.

20:50.424 --> 20:52.239
Hey, you want to play
some one-on-one?

20:52.807 --> 20:54.658
Girl, I'll wipe
the floor with you.

20:54.659 --> 20:55.623
You better sit back...

20:55.624 --> 20:57.516
But you have
not seen my move.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.866
Bring it on, little missy!

20:59.867 --> 21:01.051
What's up?

21:05.724 --> 21:07.250
That was my move!

21:07.251 --> 21:08.607
I'm a cheerleader!

21:21.824 --> 21:23.858
Eddie! So, is that
your Spanish test?

21:23.859 --> 21:24.910
How'd you do?

21:24.911 --> 21:25.928
See for yourself.

21:25.929 --> 21:28.293
Oh, Eddie...

21:28.294 --> 21:30.698
I'm so amazed!
You got a C!

21:30.699 --> 21:32.282
Plus, plus!

21:32.283 --> 21:33.731
Keep your eyes
on the plus!

21:34.748 --> 21:36.313
Way to go, Eddie.

21:37.073 --> 21:39.222
I wouldn't have pulled it off
without you guys.

21:39.223 --> 21:41.398
I mean, I guess all the cramming
really paid off.

21:41.399 --> 21:42.728
Congratulations, Eddie.

21:43.513 --> 21:44.708
Don't matter.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.072
I don't care
if I'm on the team.

21:46.073 --> 21:47.208
No big deal!

21:52.568 --> 21:53.758
Let it out, Eddie.

21:53.759 --> 21:54.764
Really?

21:56.324 --> 21:59.228
I'm on the team!

21:59.229 --> 22:02.512
I'm on the team!

22:02.513 --> 22:05.253
I'm on the team!

22:05.254 --> 22:08.698
I'm on the team!
