(INHALES) This is a Ometepe.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.147
It's beautiful.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.982
It's gorgeous. Thanks for showing us that.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.608
- Thank you.
- Thanks for that gift.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.987
Lindsay and I hiked to the peak,
and we swam in a crater.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.740
- MAN 2: Oh, wow.
- Only took us 12 hours up and down.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.909
- Is that all?
- Twelve hours? That's it? Fuck.

00:34.993 --> 00:38.329
- I uncovered a lot that I'd been burying.
- Oh.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.708
The food at the Eagle Lodge.
The breakfast is insane.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.460
- Hao, show them.
- Oh, yeah.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.379
We actually love breakfast.
We've seen a ton of breakfasts. Thank you.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.673
I'm sure. And the pictures
are so small you can barely…

00:48.757 --> 00:50.842
You're right. You know, watch this.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.260
What?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.179
- LINDSAY: Yeah, yeah.
- Just takes a second.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.640
LINDSAY: Yeah. It'll work, it'll work.
It's worth the wait.

01:01.853 --> 01:02.854
Do you want more fernet?

01:02.937 --> 01:05.190
- We're still working on it.
- We're still… Yeah.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.566
- Thank you though.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.404

01:13.323 --> 01:15.533
- It's good for you.
- It's like medicine.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.703
(SPITS IN GLASS)
Very good. Very nice. Yeah.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.414
- HAO: Here we go. Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- MAN 2: Oh, wow!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.124
MAN 2: That is breakfast.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.293
- Fernet? I'm sorry, fernet?
- Oh, I know.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.129
- Why can't they just drink wine?
- Because everybody drinks wine.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.715
Yeah. Well, everyone drinks wine
for a reason.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.634
How long till we have to
hang out with them again?

01:32.717 --> 01:36.095
I know. I know it's annoying,
but Lindsay's like family to me.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.555
We went to college together.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.892
A bunch of people went to art school
with Hitler, but eventually they moved on.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.310
- Fair.
- Very fair.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.187
Whoa, wait. Until the mailbox.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.981
Are you crazy? I'll give you hydrant,
and that's all I'll give you.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.316
Hydrant? Don't be a pussy.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.652
Okay, no. Um, ugly bush.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.736
- Ugly bush.
- Ugly bush.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.823
Ready? Here it comes. And that's the bush.

01:54.906 --> 01:59.160
- (TAUNTING WHINE)
- Oh… Oh-ho-ho.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.703
- Don't brake. Do not brake!
- I'm not braking!

02:00.787 --> 02:02.330
- Do not brake!
- I'm not braking!

02:07.627 --> 02:09.670
Whoo!

02:09.753 --> 02:11.548
- You clicked before ugly bush.
- Bullshit.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.466
You did. It was way before the bush.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.135
No. We grazed the fucking fence.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.928
I actually think
that we scratched the bumper.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.555
So? That's what it's there for.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.099
It's called a bumper.
It's meant to bump into things.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.184
But they charge you for that
when you return the lease,

02:23.268 --> 02:26.062
and I think some of the rubber
rubbed off on the fucking fence.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.981
Landlord's gonna take that
out of our security deposit.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.401
You're right. We should move out before
our landlord realizes what we've done.

02:31.484 --> 02:35.029
We could hide out on Ometepe.
I hear it's really nice this time of year.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.197
- Great breakfasts.
- Yeah.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.740
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.264
You know, Lindsay and Hao make
all other humans miserable,

02:43.306 --> 02:44.853
but they actually make
each other really happy.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.708
Oh, my God. Those two?

02:46.791 --> 02:50.920
Yeah. I know it's crazy, but he looks
at her like he's just met her.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.963
That's a fuckin' act.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.131
- No, it's not.
- It is.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.633
No, when they talk to each other,
they're not just talking.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.636
- They're really listening.
- Believe me, it's bullshit, okay?

02:58.720 --> 02:59.721
They're not happy.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.806
Not like we're happy.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.685
And speaking of happy…

03:06.769 --> 03:08.271
you know what day today is?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.607
- That's not until tomorrow.
- Mmm.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.444
I am so sorry.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.155
You're sorry you said it,
or you're sorry you're not happy?

on saying anything today.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.878

physically couldn't hold it in anymore.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.046
It was emotional diarrhea.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.839

You are such a good person, Sam,
and I want to be happy with you.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.552
I really, really do, but…

05:44.635 --> 05:46.554
We've been together for three years.
You couldn't talk to me?

05:46.637 --> 05:49.640
Every time I try and talk to you
about my feelings, you get mad.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.894
That's because your feelings
are fucking bullshit.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.730
You get off on not being happy
when everything's fucking fine.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.733
Are you fucking serious?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.862
Did that seem fine to you?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.700
I'm not saying that we're perfect. Okay?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.494
Nobody's fucking perfect.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.162
I know that.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.875
I just want the most perfect version
of imperfectness.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.006
I, um…

06:23.132 --> 06:25.134
Tell me what's wrong.
What are you missing?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.596
I know I miss the person
that I met three years ago.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.515
You can't do that, okay?

06:30.598 --> 06:32.642
You can't compare me now
to the me three years ago.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.061
- That guy was wooing you.
- You should never stop wooing.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.773
This orange juice is freshly squeezed.
I just wooed your ass off.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.191
You drove ten minutes.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.194
Into gang territory.
How do you forget that so quickly?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.779
For your favorite scone.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.115
We split this thing every time we go.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.450
- You love that fucking scone.
- No, they're fine, okay?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.577
You were so excited to get me
to try them the first time

06:51.661 --> 06:54.831
that I didn't want to disappoint you,
but you love these things, Sam.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.208
My guess is you probably woke up
this morning craving them,

06:57.291 --> 06:59.877
and you knew you had to do something
vaguely nice for our anniversary,

06:59.961 --> 07:02.922
so you decided to kill two birds
with one scone.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.008
In England, they pronounce it “skahn.”

07:06.092 --> 07:08.845
When's the last time
you did something just for me?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.597
Because that's what the guy
that I first met would do.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.266

you're not Shira Weinberg?

my name is Mollie.

- Mollie.
- Mm-hmm.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.592
- Of course. Nice to meet you, Mollie.
- Nice to meet you.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.221
If I flirt with you right now,
I look like an asshole, right?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.265
Because you know
I'm waiting for somebody else?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.018
You have amazing eyes, Mollie.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.604
I did it. Fuck it, I did it.
I flirted with you anyway.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.732
Who am I? I'm Sam. Nice to meet you.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.736
So is it like a blind date?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.363
(CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS) Well, to be honest…

08:09.447 --> 08:11.699
I love when people specify “to be honest.”

08:11.782 --> 08:13.910
Does that mean I can assume
everything you've said before

08:13.993 --> 08:16.323
and are about to say
to me is bullshit?

08:19.234 --> 08:21.588
- It's an Internet date.
- God help you.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.420
Mmm. I don't think he will,
seeing as I don't believe in him,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.297
which is probably why
he's punishing me now

08:26.380 --> 08:28.925
by making you not Shira Weinberg.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.885
You really don't believe
that there's anything out there?

08:30.968 --> 08:32.970
I don't not believe.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.640
I feel like it's something
that humans can never fathom.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.934
Like quarks. Or black Republicans.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.647
- I believe in ghosts.
- I am so sorry. I think I did see Shira.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.731
I know it's crazy,

08:43.813 --> 08:47.109
but I like people too much
to believe that they just go away.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.613
I wish I liked people that much.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.698
Maybe you just know the wrong ones.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.330
So what is this meeting?
Is it like a thing?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.249
- A thing?
- Is it a date? I want to know…

09:01.332 --> 09:02.833
- Is it a date?
- I'm not answering that question.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.918
Okay.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.755
And it looks like your thing
just walked in.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.966
No, no, no, no. That is not Shira.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.759
You're right. She's more of a Dawn.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.054
- Oh, that's a Dawn.
- Yeah, she lives at home with her parents.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.514
She's really into firemen.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.349
Yeah, she used to be a cheerleader,

09:18.432 --> 09:20.268
but one of the ones
on the bottom of the pyramid,

09:20.351 --> 09:22.895
because she's beautiful but also sturdy,
knows how to get it done.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.314
- I used to be a cheerleader.
- I'm listening.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.816
It was the worst.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.694
The football players smelled.
The girls were brutal to me.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.197
They absolutely tortured me.
If you were just at all different…

09:33.281 --> 09:35.449
Do you still have the uniform or…

09:35.533 --> 09:38.703
I am opening up my soul to you
about the torture of my childhood,

09:38.786 --> 09:39.787
and this is your question?

09:39.870 --> 09:42.498
I'm so sorry, but do you have the uniform?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.001
I have it somewhere, yeah.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.630
All right, Mollie. We know about Dawn.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.425
Why don't we give these two a shot?
Who are these two?

09:52.508 --> 09:55.261
Well, she's Patricia,
a pharmaceutical rep,

09:55.344 --> 09:56.721
and Dale.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.055
- Oh, wow.
- The doctor.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.349
- Of course he is.
- And he became a doctor

10:00.433 --> 10:01.517
to meet a pharmaceutical rep.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.102
This happened the exact way he wanted?

10:03.185 --> 10:04.520
- Exactly.
- Unbelievable.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.356
It's under Weinberg. W-E-I-N…

10:07.440 --> 10:09.275
- Ah.
- …berg as in “berg.”

10:09.358 --> 10:11.152
- Hey, she's cute.
- Yeah.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.945
- I have really good taste in women.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.828
Hey.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.121
(KISSING)

10:23.372 --> 10:25.374

10:26.167 --> 10:29.170
You were nervous I was gonna
fall in love with Shira Weinberg.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.715
Now, Mollie, if you will, I have to go.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.925
Lateness is one of Shira's pet peeves.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.596
- You're actually gonna go through with it?
- Yeah.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.974
I can't leave her stranded like that.
That'd be cruel.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.100
Also, she is waving.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.979
Could you wave back with me
so it looks like we're… Yes. Fantastic.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.439
Okay. Great.

10:48.522 --> 10:52.151
Rest assured though, I'll be
thinking about you the entire time.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.363
Bye, Moll.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.993
Hey. Mollie, what do you do for a living?

11:01.077 --> 11:04.330
Really? I expected more from you
than that. That is such a cliché question.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.539
Yeah, it's a cliché question,

11:05.623 --> 11:08.209
but if you don't tell me,
how am I going to be able to stalk you?

11:10.586 --> 11:14.090
The edible arrangement you sent?
That guy was romantic.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.425
Romantic. You're pissing in front of me.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.010
Yeah, I've been drinking a lot of water.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.346
I'm staying hydrated.
You should be happy for me.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.722
And you didn't love that guy.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.683
You hated the me you met.
You know you did.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.976
I did not.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.980
- You did. You hated my hair.
- Yeah, it was science teacher creepy.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.440
- You hated my clothes.
- Oh, yeah.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.858
Do you remember those shoes?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
- You hated my apartment.
- Yeah, it was depressing.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.072
What's depressing is your idealizing the
past when you were never happy with me.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.825
- You're never happy with anything.

There's nothing out there.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.263
Or maybe there is.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.348
No. I think you just smell
a raccoon or something.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.766
Yeah, either that or

12:06.267 --> 12:10.020
there's an evil creature
lurking in the bushes, taunting him.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.356
But you will never catch him

- It was majestic.
- It was majestic.

Oh, shit. My dad's gonna kill me.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.249
That's right. You gotta take your dad
to his thing today.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.960
Wait. His “thing”?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.379
His thing, it's called chemo.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.132
- My dad has cancer and he's getting chemo.
- I know.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.967

- You know what I meant.

Yeah? I've seen less sugarcoating
on a Krispy Kreme.

- No…
- According to you,

13:28.349 --> 13:31.477
my father just has some extra-fun
bonus tissue in his colon.

These cells are real fast growers.”

Or see us having sex

in the broken blinds in the window.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.578
We can't talk about money in a taxi

You somehow manage to control
whether or not you fall in love.

in love. It's called falling in love.

“another perspective”?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.262
Mollie…

21:04.346 --> 21:07.015
Is this about your dad,
or is this about us breaking up?

21:07.099 --> 21:10.227
- Space can be good.
- How long you been planning this?

21:11.812 --> 21:15.023
It's just a time-out.
It doesn't have to be a huge thing.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.359
Pick up the rest of your shit today.
All right?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.444
Come on. Whoa.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.449
Well, fuck. (SIGHS)

21:26.034 --> 21:28.787
Fine. It's totally okay.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.707
We both needed a break. Just…

21:33.709 --> 21:34.710
(GRUNTS) Oh.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.095
I don't need a man.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.682
I got it. You're independent, Mollie.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.393
Mom?

21:57.441 --> 21:58.442
MAN: She's dead to me.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.943
The thing about Mollie is…

22:00.027 --> 22:02.696
Who? Oh, the dead girl,
because she's so dead to me.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.031
Ed, you can't say that…

22:04.114 --> 22:06.867
This woman strings you along
for three fucking years.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.620
And not just any years.
The golden fucking years of your mid-30s.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.665
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it complicated?

22:13.749 --> 22:15.834
She's an awful person.
She doesn't appreciate you.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.629
You don't understand, okay?
All you see is happy fun-time friend Sam.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.882
- I'm a blast around you.
- You're not that fun.

22:21.965 --> 22:26.094
You're not privy to all my faults, like
two beers almost always leads to eight,

22:26.178 --> 22:29.347
and when I get upset,
I say these venomous, acidic things

22:29.431 --> 22:31.433
that I would never say in a million years.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.351
Also, I'm not as thoughtful
as I was at the beginning.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.728
Basically, you're a human being.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.482
And believe me,
you're a really good one, Sam.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.109
All right?
And if she can't see that, then fuck her!

22:41.193 --> 22:42.235
Wow, that turned.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.487
Come here.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.197
- Come here.
- Nah.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.199
- Hey, hey.
- I don't want to.

22:47.282 --> 22:51.119
I have never seen anyone
more in need of a hug in my life.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.288
Bring that shit in. Come here. Come on.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.790
- I don't want to.
- It's happening.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.166
- Don't. Don't.
- Five, four,

22:56.249 --> 22:57.584
- three…
- Four, five.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.668
- Don't count up.
- Six.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.962
You messed it… Fuck this. There we go.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.090
- There it is. Mmm.
- Mmm.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.842
Just breathe. There you go.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.760
(EXHALES)

23:06.843 --> 23:08.762
It's a huge problem with American men,

23:08.845 --> 23:12.099
how you're uncomfortable
sharing physical affection like this.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.351
Did you know Italian dudes
hold hands in the street?

23:14.434 --> 23:15.644
I didn't know that.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.480
- French dudes kiss hello.
- On the mouth?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.065
I was watching footie the other night,

23:20.148 --> 23:23.110
and this Portuguese player scored a goal,
and basically a gang bang broke out.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.695
I don't get soccer.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.907
I feel better. I do feel better.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.535
(CHUCKLES) Thank you for that.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.558
Oh, you just checked to
see if she texted you.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.113
I'm checking to see if
the buyer called, okay?

23:38.166 --> 23:39.751
It's like you just gave her your digits

23:39.835 --> 23:41.837
and you're waiting for
that first text back.

23:51.138 --> 23:51.972
(DING)

23:58.645 --> 23:59.646
(WARBLES)

24:02.899 --> 24:04.276
(WARBLES)

24:06.027 --> 24:07.028
(WARBLES)

24:09.322 --> 24:11.533
- (WARBLES)
- (CHUCKLES)

24:15.453 --> 24:17.455
Ahhh…

24:33.388 --> 24:35.265
Ahem!

24:35.348 --> 24:36.683
Whoo!

24:40.061 --> 24:42.230
We've got to get you back out there.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.065
I'm gonna set you up
with one of Priya's mates.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.235
Jesus Christ. Ed, no, no, no, no.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.780
The last thing I want to do in the fucking
universe now is start dating again.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.366
I used to think that arranged marriages
were unethical,

24:53.450 --> 24:56.119
but now I'm starting to think
they're the less painful process.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.705
Doing it ourselves? That shit is inhumane.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.167
Look at your parents. They had an arranged
marriage, and they're super happy.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.420
My parents met at medical school.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.671
- Right.
- Yeah.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.506
- Asshole.
- Right, right.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.592
I was kidding. I was kidding.

25:14.137 --> 25:17.599
I know that Sam's a good person deep down,
but is that good enough?

25:17.682 --> 25:20.477
And is good enough
good enough for the rest of my life?

25:21.061 --> 25:23.313
- No kidding.
- (EARPHONES: MAN SPEAKING)

25:25.065 --> 25:26.900
And that's when I decided to kill Sam.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.443
Yeah.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.238
With one of those spiky metal balls,
and nobody's been suspicious,

25:31.321 --> 25:34.324
because I've just been dragging his corpse
around Weekend at Bernie's style.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.702
- Well, he's a good guy, Mollie.
- (SIGHS)

25:37.786 --> 25:40.538
- What are you listening to?
- What? No, I have it…

25:40.622 --> 25:43.208
- I have it way down.
- Torah on Tape?

25:43.291 --> 25:46.544
You know,
I've never actually read the whole Bible.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.381
You still haven't read it.
Somebody's reading it to you.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.924
- What?
- Okay.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.927
It's just gonna be the one night here.
Then I'm gonna stay with a friend.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.554
Listen, you're gonna work this out
with Sam, okay?

25:56.638 --> 26:00.016
I mean,
you're always like this with decisions.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.018
- This is different.
- How?

26:02.686 --> 26:03.895
I don't know. I guess…

26:04.688 --> 26:07.691
it doesn't just affect me,
it's also about Sam.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.402
And a potential baby creature.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.321
- No.
- Oh!

26:13.405 --> 26:15.991
- Mom…
- Oh, wait. Shh.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.076
Oh, I think I felt something.

26:18.159 --> 26:23.039
Oh, congratulations. You are the proud
grandmother of a vegan breakfast bowl.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.918
That's mean. That's just mean.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.714
Andiamo, bella. We go chemo.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.299
Yeah, we go chemo.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.592
…A high wind advisory
for Riverside County…

26:34.676 --> 26:37.595
Ah. Fucking Hal-a Storm.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.139
You don't like Hal Storm?

26:39.222 --> 26:40.807
He hates him.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.684
He think he so smart.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.769
Hal-a Storm.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.231
- One hundred years young today.
- (LAUGHING) Wow!

26:48.898 --> 26:50.025
Moses.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.193
- Come on.
- MOLLIE'S MOM: Crazy.

26:54.195 --> 26:57.282
So we get into
this very real fucking fight.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.200
Then instead of dealing with it,

26:59.284 --> 27:01.494
she goes and runs off
to her fucking parents.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.540
No, I don't buy it.
No, she's probably with a rebound guy.

27:05.623 --> 27:08.293
Rebounding right onto
another dude's genitals.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.671
Say what you will about Mollie,
she'd never do anything like that.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.590
Oh, you're naive.

27:13.673 --> 27:15.800
- Women are like dogs.
- Wow. I say that as a dog lover.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.263
But the truth is,
you have to establish dominance early,

27:20.347 --> 27:22.599
- or they'll piss all over your rug.
- Okay.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.351
For the record, we've always hated her.

27:25.518 --> 27:26.353
Who's “we”?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.480
Me and your mum. We Facebook message.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.315
My mom's on Facebook? This is your problem, mate.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.736
Mollie is some flip-over-your-head,

27:34.819 --> 27:37.530
bicycle kick,
high-degree-of-difficulty shit.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.574
It doesn't have to be this hard.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.701
Go for a girl that's into you.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.121
What about the one you whined about
before Mollie? That lasted, like, a year.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.916
Georgia.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.645
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.106
Georgia was… She was awesome.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.901
She was sweet, she was nice,
but I feel like something was missing.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.611
Yeah, the misery.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.364
Maybe Mollie and I are just too different.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.991
Like I see the glass of water
as half full.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.035
She sees the water as poisoned.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.788
Also, there's a chip in the glass,
so when you drink it,

28:26.871 --> 28:28.848
it's gonna cut your esophagus,
you're gonna bleed everywhere.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.922
Why don't we ask that
waiter for a new glass now.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.962
She just won't let herself be happy.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.672
And neither will you.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.592
Stop punishing yourself.
Find something simpler.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.303
Can we please
just get ready for this pitch?

28:42.387 --> 28:45.598
I can't work in the fucking office
designing deodorant labels anymore.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.226
We have to get our shirts on this website.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.646
- Eddie, is it okay if I do…
- No, not in this heat.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.231
- No, you don't have to.
- Hey, hey.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.443
Cold, cold, low spin.
The sexy shit doesn't go in the dryer.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.027
- Yeah.
- I got it.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.362
Okay. Good luck, guys.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.947
- Bye, muffin.
- Thanks, Priya.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.870
- What?
- I'm trying to remember.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.122
- It's cold, cold, low spin.
- Cold, cold…

29:09.205 --> 29:10.623
Wait, wait. Cold, cold.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.624
- Low spin.
- Low spin.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.876
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fantastic.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.794
You're like Cesar Millan
the way you establish dominance.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.630
- This is an entirely different situation.
- That is totally different?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.007
Tell me why.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.676
I'm not supposed to say anything
for, like, three months,

29:21.760 --> 29:24.012
- but that's in a week.
- Oh.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.222
- That woman now carries my seed.
- Ed.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.600
It's a total shift
in the dominance paradigm.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.935
My prince is in there.
That makes her a queen.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.688
Are you…? Mmm…

29:33.772 --> 29:35.315
You barely know this girl.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.483
I know.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.234
But look at what you're dealing with.

29:38.318 --> 29:41.029
Maybe it's better this way, right?
Rip off the Band-Aid.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.448
How does it even…? Did the condom break?

29:43.531 --> 29:45.283
There's no condom. I do the pullout.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.577
- You do the pullout method?
- Yeah, our futon is fucked.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.455
What about the pre-cum?
You don't even think about the pre-cum.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.332
I always thought that was
some old wives' tale.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.751
Yeah.
An old wife with a very large family.

29:54.834 --> 29:55.752
WOMAN: Hello?

29:56.461 --> 29:58.713
- ED: You must be the buyer from Shoppy.
- Welcome.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.631
Come in.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.801
I have to pick up my son
from preschool at 4:30.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.540
Great. Great. Kids are important.

30:07.865 --> 30:10.994
What's…? Whoa.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.229
- What is this?
- (CHUCKLES)

30:14.896 --> 30:19.901
Uh, your mother. She buy it. For my head.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.277
Why don't you wear it?

30:24.322 --> 30:26.908
- (MOLLIE LAUGHS)
- I look like Three Stooge.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.662
Sam loves The Three Stooges.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.958
Sam. How come he no ask you to marry?

30:36.251 --> 30:38.670
Because he knows
that we're still figuring it out.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.421
Oh, no rush.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.800
Stage four. I have plenty of time.

30:43.883 --> 30:46.427
Uh, thank you. I needed more pressure.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.013
- You better adjust your thinking, Curly.
- Yeah.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.016
Because even if I get back together
with Sam,

30:52.100 --> 30:53.893
I don't think we're going to get married.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.311
What is this?

30:55.395 --> 30:56.980
- Yeah, marriage is bullshit.
- Ah!

30:57.063 --> 30:59.899
And weddings are an even bigger waste.
Why should I get married?

30:59.983 --> 31:02.151
So we can get new plates
we're afraid to eat off of?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.611
Bella, bella.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.489
Weddings are-are, uh, beautiful.

31:07.490 --> 31:11.411
I walk you down the aisle, people cry.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.162
Beautiful. Capito?

31:13.955 --> 31:16.541
- You want to know why I cry at weddings?
- Ah.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.544
- Because I feel bad for the bride.
- (CHUCKLES)

31:19.627 --> 31:21.588
If he asked me today, I'd say no.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.508
But you wrong.
And he should still ask you.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.219
That would require him
making a big decision on his own,

31:28.303 --> 31:30.722
and, trust me, that ain't happening.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.057
So what do you think?

31:33.141 --> 31:34.517
Ooh, they're great.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.312
- Yeah, but which do you prefer?
- I don't…

31:37.395 --> 31:39.606
- No, pick one.
- The one in the middle.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.733
- The door's already painted that color.
- Ah.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.068
(MOLLIE GIGGLES)

31:44.152 --> 31:46.112
(SAM INHALES SHARPLY)

31:47.530 --> 31:49.449
This way you can get whatever you want.

31:52.201 --> 31:55.496
- Okay.
- Okay, next time, just pick something.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.124
Please. Even if it's wrong, I'll love it.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.718
- MOLLIE: What do you think?
- Whichever is fine.

32:01.742 --> 32:04.042
- All right, I always pick.
- And you do an excellent job.

32:04.464 --> 32:07.467
It's Italian and Vietnamese.
Two very distinct choices.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.093
Please stop being so wishy-washy.

32:09.177 --> 32:12.597
I don't see you making a decision,
all right? You're just as noncommittal.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.726
D-D-Dad, no, back streets, back streets.
Come on. Traffic.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.562
(SIGHS)
The freeway's terrible this time of day.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.940
I told you six times, take back streets.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.025
You know what I think?

32:24.859 --> 32:28.613
I think Samuel, he no want to take charge

32:28.696 --> 32:33.409
because you, you only like things
the way you like them.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.454
Okay, yeah. A little faster.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.415
No, no, slow down, slow down.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.168
Okay. Lean back a little. Like…

32:42.251 --> 32:44.128
- Like that?
- Lean back. Yeah, right there.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.339
No.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.134
(EXHALES) Okay.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.470
- Go. Do it.
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.392
A dress.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.394
- You hate it.
- No.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.771
No? Look me in the eyes
and tell me you like it.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.858
I can always return it.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.445
Right there. But stay there.
Now go in a circle.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.906
- Like…
- No, no, counterclockwise, yes.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.616
Okay, is that counterclockwise?

33:13.700 --> 33:16.077
- Yeah. It's winding backwards.
- Okay, clockwise, clockwise.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.416
Fine. Fucking… Vietnamese.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.836
Really? That's a lot of mint.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.880
This is how you are.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.133
Your way or the highway.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.720
Yeah, and look around.
The highway is terrible.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.264
No, that's all right.

33:36.347 --> 33:40.059
- Move… They moving. Must be accident.
- (HORN HONKING)

33:43.312 --> 33:44.397
Mm-hmm.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.192
Why don't we… Here, take a seat.
We're gonna show you.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.361
Put that in the perfect… Okay.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.281
And hit your mark and look at her
and smile.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.742
And start talking now.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.121
I'm sure you've seen these before.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.293
The douche… was not content
to subtly announce his douche-hood.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.378
He wanted to scream it.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.422
TOGETHER: “I'm wearing a shirt!”

34:09.505 --> 34:12.800
SAM: But some people
don't want their shirts to shout,

34:12.884 --> 34:14.802
and a plain shirt is boring.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.554
Not these though.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.933
TOGETHER:
Even if you're the only one who knows it.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.351
And then give her the shirt. Give it.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.697
It's intriguing.

34:35.614 --> 34:36.616
Great. Thank you.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.415
ED: Oh…

34:44.498 --> 34:46.333
ED: There was ink on the chair.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.382
- What?
- It wasn't even about you.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.719
I was thinking about, like,
what time was Frasier on.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.430
- Frasier was on what time?
- 9:30.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.809
9:00 Central. We were just wondering
what time Frasier was on.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.102
It was a good show.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.021

They just like us.

35:11.025 --> 35:14.695

Relax. We just dying.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.537
Read something.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.830
I don't want to.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.457
Hospital magazines freak me out.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.918
Gloria, my daughter.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.797
She think she gonna catch cancer
from National Geographic.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.967
- I'm getting a drink. You want something?
- Martini, three olive.

Arik. Hi.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.872
Hi. How random is this?

36:05.955 --> 36:07.665
- It's so random.
- Come here.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.749
MOLLIE: Oh.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.585
Oh.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.714
Of course,
I run into you looking like shit.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.799
No, you look, you look… You don't…

36:16.883 --> 36:21.888
I've been up since 2 a.m.
Talia, my wife, just delivered.

Congratulations, “Dad.”

- That's me. (LAUGHS)

- God, you're gonna be such a great dad.
- Oh?

36:30.605 --> 36:33.316
Yeah. You were always just so…

36:34.859 --> 36:37.320
Do you remember that time
we found the kitten under the truck?

36:37.403 --> 36:39.655
You let it sleep in the bed
even though you're allergic.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.781
Most guys would do that.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.159
Most men wouldn't even
crawl under the truck.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.493
(ARIK LAUGHS)

36:45.870 --> 36:48.539
- You'll make a good father.
- Thank you.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.462
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

36:54.545 --> 36:58.341
How did you know, um, with Talia…

36:59.342 --> 37:01.677
that she was the one?

37:02.845 --> 37:04.347
That's a good question.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.893
Yeah, I'm not sure you ever do.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.607
- I should get going.
- Yeah.

Oh, no. (LAUGHS)

37:21.322 --> 37:22.323
No, I mean it.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.369
You know, you have a memory
of people from the past,

37:26.452 --> 37:29.080
and usually reality disappoints.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.624
But that's not the case.

(GASPS) Oh! (CHUCKLES)

38:05.908 --> 38:07.410
Don't look at me that way.

Dude, that's not coming out.
It's not fucking coming out.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.463
It's gonna come out.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.215
It will not come out. Ever.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.175
Well, we use really good ink.

more comfortable in a T-shirt?

38:27.972 --> 38:29.598

why I need to sell your shit.

It is… Ugh.

I don't want to tell you.
It's a competing e-tailer.

- Oh, here we go.

- Who broke up with whom?

- Ah, it's complicated.
- She dumped him.

- Big-time.
- Hey.

Answer it. I don't mind.

talk about it ever again.

in an overcrowded marketplace.

- What happened?
- Over there?

39:58.229 --> 40:00.648
Nothing. She wanted eggs.
I'm gonna get her some eggs.

It shouldn't be.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.232
Go home. That should be your priority.

I see what you're doing, and it's awesome,
but I'm not going home.

who's prepared for a skunking

of how disgusting what you're doing is?

going like this.

or something, freeze your tits off.

43:31.984 --> 43:32.985
It was.

44:01.513 --> 44:02.598
It was very good.

44:02.681 --> 44:05.726
I would probably say top three.
Honestly, I gotta put it in the top three.

- They give you your own entire casita.
- Mmm.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.912

that a fancy businessman would stay

44:24.995 --> 44:28.290
and, like, order
a very expensive escort for the evening.

- Yeah.

No, no, I want to be the hooker.

She's never been there before.

44:53.482 --> 44:55.401

45:00.322 --> 45:02.157
Is that butthole open for business?

45:03.075 --> 45:05.494
Is that butthole…? Is that tokus…?
No, tushy.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.330
Does that tushy need a banging?

45:08.914 --> 45:10.582
I guess I'm a bad boy too.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.960
Yeah, I cheat on my taxes.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.045

meaning that sometime in the future,
that would be the time.

so you could rebound right onto him.

- Because with you, the door's always open.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.149
Are you all right?

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.733
Yeah, I just, um…

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:17.653
We have the same anniversary.

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.529
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.911
Hey, you scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.872
Are these like potions?

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.038
(LAUGHS)

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.803
There's no lotion.

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:45.471
I can't find the lotion.
What does it look like?

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.349
WOMAN: Lotion-y.

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:50.477
Fucking lotion-y.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.399
- WOMAN: Mmm.
- Sorry.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.400
What?

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.197
How was the scone?

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:31.829
It was a little stale.

01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:34.206
You know how it gets
at the end of the day.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.084
But it was worth the wait.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.753
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.048
- Wow, you smell like a bar.
- Okay.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.385
Actually, you smell like the rubber mat
on the ground behind the bar. Why?

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.804
Well, you look like a young…

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.348
Your hair looks like Bamm-Bamm from…

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.685
- (LAUGHING)
- You look amazing.

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.770
Mmm.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.231
Bonk.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:00.816
Bonk.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.279
You sure about this?

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.490
Nope. You?

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:10.492
No, not even close.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.413
But three years is a long time.

01:12:15.622 --> 01:12:18.375
If we can make it this long, who knows?

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:19.960
Nobody.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.172
Nobody knows,
or else it'd just be too easy, right?

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.008
Stop being such a pessimist.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.042
- (SIGHS)
- So last night.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.418
- Mm-hmm?
- Top three?

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.128
Tsk. I don't know.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.214
Mmm…

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.050
- I think we have a new leader.
- Whoa! Bold statement.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:09.676
- That's number one?
- You don't agree?

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.053
I do.

01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:13.055
I do, but you know what? We can do better.

01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:16.433
If we hit it down once or twice a day,
we can knock it out of the park.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.644
Do you think you have the stamina
to keep up with me?

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.021
Do I think I have the stamina
to keep up with you?

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:21.897
Whoa, whoa.

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:24.066
Mailbox.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:27.861
Mailbox.

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.410
Go.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:36.870
Open gate.

01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:43.910
