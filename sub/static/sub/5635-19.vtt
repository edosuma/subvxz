00:01.849 --> 00:03.634
(phone ringing) LINDA:
Will somebody get that?

00:03.635 --> 00:04.751
LOUISE: Gene, why don't
you get the phone?

00:04.752 --> 00:05.968
You're so good at it.

00:06.004 --> 00:07.638
You know, it could be someone

00:07.639 --> 00:09.256
offering free chicken satay...

00:09.257 --> 00:11.508
I'll get it, I'll get it!

00:11.509 --> 00:13.844
Bob's Burg... Aah!
It's all over my ear!

00:13.845 --> 00:15.678
(cackles) You just got gooped.

00:15.763 --> 00:17.597
Aah! Mmm. Grape jelly.

00:17.682 --> 00:19.816
This is the best prank war
we've ever had.

00:19.817 --> 00:21.017
Goop there it is.

00:21.102 --> 00:23.237
Aw! Did I just miss a goop?

00:23.238 --> 00:24.988
(groans) Haven't you kids
done enough gooping?

00:24.989 --> 00:26.189
Never!

00:26.190 --> 00:28.690
Ah! Guacamole!

00:28.693 --> 00:31.111
No! Shaving cream!

00:31.112 --> 00:32.779
Ah! Hummus!

00:32.780 --> 00:34.081
Ah! Toothpaste!

00:34.082 --> 00:36.198
Double goop! Double goop!

00:36.251 --> 00:38.619
So, pretty much just
a huge waste of food.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.370
And toiletries.
(phone ringing)

00:40.371 --> 00:41.922
You kids didn't goop the phone
in the kitchen, did you?

00:41.923 --> 00:43.340
Well, there's no way
to know for sure.

00:43.341 --> 00:44.708
It's clean.

00:44.709 --> 00:46.175
I mean, as clean as it ever is.

00:46.210 --> 00:47.293
Bob's Burgers.

00:47.378 --> 00:48.512
(loudly): Hello, Bob.

00:48.513 --> 00:49.796
It's Skip Marooch.

00:49.797 --> 00:50.963
The celebrity chef!

00:51.049 --> 00:52.466
Skip Marooch. Hi.

00:52.467 --> 00:53.933
I... um, I can barely hear you.

00:54.018 --> 00:55.552
I'm in a helicopter.

00:55.553 --> 00:58.104
I'm searching for exotic spices
for my new book.

00:58.189 --> 01:00.307
Oh. Is that a good way
to do that?

01:00.308 --> 01:02.225
I mean, spices are so small.

01:02.226 --> 01:04.610
Listen, you know how much
I like your food, right?

01:04.696 --> 01:05.728
Yeah. Thanks.

01:05.813 --> 01:07.531
I just got off the phone

01:07.532 --> 01:09.533
with a journalist
for Coasters magazine.

01:09.534 --> 01:12.152
They're doing a piece
on unknown restaurants.

01:12.153 --> 01:14.071
It's like an "undiscovered gems"
kind of thing.

01:14.072 --> 01:17.323
I told them they should try
your place, Bob.

01:17.408 --> 01:18.909
Oh, that's great.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.744
I mean, we're not unknown, Skip.

01:20.745 --> 01:23.079
I mean, I feel like
we're sort of under-known.

01:23.131 --> 01:24.381
No, I know.

01:24.382 --> 01:25.632
But here's the thing,

01:25.633 --> 01:27.467
they have to do it today.

01:27.468 --> 01:30.087
Can you do 3:00, Bob?
Uh, yeah!

01:30.088 --> 01:31.971
Great! This'll really
put you on the map.

01:32.056 --> 01:33.222
Wow. Thank you.

01:33.257 --> 01:35.092
Did I tell you
I'm in a helicopter?

01:35.093 --> 01:37.010
Yep. Yep, that's great.

01:37.011 --> 01:39.096
This is exciting.
Guess who that was?

01:39.097 --> 01:40.314
Uh... Alive or dead?

01:40.315 --> 01:41.565
No. Linda.

01:41.566 --> 01:43.183
It was Skip Marooch.

01:43.184 --> 01:44.935
Oh. That's why you
said "Skip Marooch"

01:44.936 --> 01:46.186
when you picked up the phone.

01:46.187 --> 01:47.938
He told this magazine
writer about us

01:47.939 --> 01:49.656
and now he's coming here
this afternoon at 3:00

01:49.657 --> 01:51.274
to do a profile on us.

01:51.275 --> 01:52.775
He's bringing
a photographer with him.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.361
I hope it's Annie Leibovitz.

01:54.362 --> 01:56.746
I wanna be pregnant
and painted like Demi Moore!

01:56.781 --> 01:58.782
What magazine is it?
‭Coasters.

01:58.783 --> 02:00.334
(gasps) Coasters?

02:00.335 --> 02:01.785
Coasters.
‭Wow.

02:01.786 --> 02:03.286
You read Coasters?

02:03.287 --> 02:04.504
Everybody reads Coasters.

02:04.505 --> 02:05.956
It's that free magazine.

02:05.957 --> 02:07.257
You can't not read Coasters.

02:07.258 --> 02:08.675
Aunt Gayle bought me
a subscription.

02:08.675 --> 02:10.543
But now I'm finding out
it's free.

02:10.627 --> 02:12.379
A profile! Oh!

02:12.380 --> 02:13.630
That's practically the cover!

02:13.631 --> 02:15.432
What am I gonna wear?

02:15.433 --> 02:17.134
Wait, what are you gonna wear?
Are you ready for this?

02:17.135 --> 02:18.552
I'm... yeah, of course.

02:18.553 --> 02:19.803
I mean, I've done
interviews before.

02:19.804 --> 02:20.969
When?
‭ln the bathtub.

02:20.972 --> 02:22.179
I do both parts.

02:22.223 --> 02:23.106
How do they go?

02:23.107 --> 02:24.107
Uh... Some go well.

02:24.108 --> 02:25.274
I walked out of one.

02:25.309 --> 02:26.309
What were they asking you?

02:26.310 --> 02:27.561
Were they ding-dong questions,

02:27.562 --> 02:28.611
and you didn't want to go there?

02:28.646 --> 02:29.896
Maybe this afternoon,

02:29.897 --> 02:31.231
if you could all just act...

02:31.232 --> 02:32.733
like normal people that are...

02:32.734 --> 02:34.201
totally different people...

02:34.202 --> 02:35.651
than the people that you are.

02:35.737 --> 02:37.821
I'll be Tina.
Tina, you be me.

02:37.822 --> 02:39.989
Okay. I'll be Gene,
I like his whole deal.

02:40.074 --> 02:41.207
Also, no more gooping.

02:41.292 --> 02:42.709
No more future goopings.

02:42.710 --> 02:43.876
You got it, buddy.

02:43.961 --> 02:45.412
Louise, I am serious.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.247
Yeah, there will be no
goopings put into action

02:47.248 --> 02:49.633
excluding any and all
current or existing goopings

02:49.634 --> 02:50.917
that have heretofore been laid.

02:50.918 --> 02:52.168
Oh, my God.

02:52.253 --> 02:54.171
This could be big for us.

02:54.172 --> 02:55.505
I know, it's friggin'
Coasters, Bob.

02:55.506 --> 02:57.007
Hey, maybe you should do

02:57.008 --> 02:58.475
some practice questions
for your interview.

02:58.476 --> 02:59.892
Um, okay, sure.

02:59.977 --> 03:01.178
Okay, here we go.

03:01.179 --> 03:03.513
Who is Bob Belcher?

03:03.514 --> 03:05.849
What is Bob Belcher?

03:05.850 --> 03:08.518
Where is Bob Belcher?

03:08.519 --> 03:10.771
Okay, Lin, that...
Why is Bob Belcher?

03:10.772 --> 03:12.189
They're not gonna ask
questions like that.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.024
Ever.
‭Why? No, yeah.

03:14.025 --> 03:15.275
And you're waving
a knife in my face,

03:15.276 --> 03:16.493
which is making me nervous, Lin.

03:16.494 --> 03:18.278
You're rattled. Good.

03:18.279 --> 03:20.030
That's the first honest thing
you've said all day.

03:20.031 --> 03:22.282
Ooh. Oh, I think I might
be getting diarrhea.

03:22.283 --> 03:23.500
Okay, too honest.

03:23.501 --> 03:24.917
Oh... Panic poops.

03:25.002 --> 03:26.703
Oh, my God.

03:26.704 --> 03:28.205
I keep forgetting Gene
clogged the employee toilet.

03:28.206 --> 03:30.841
Yeah, he flushed all his old
stuffed animals down there.

03:30.842 --> 03:32.709
He's a big boy now.
Right. I know.

03:32.710 --> 03:33.959
It's just...
we should deal with it.

03:34.045 --> 03:35.262
No. He isn't ready.

03:35.263 --> 03:36.880
He visits 'em in there.

03:36.881 --> 03:38.882
Oh, boy. I'll use
the restaurant bathroom.

on this toilet seat?!

Uh-oh, Dad!

03:47.859 --> 03:49.359

‭Ugh.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.194

03:51.195 --> 03:52.696

his mid-morning bathroom break

03:52.697 --> 03:53.947
for some reason.

03:53.948 --> 03:55.649

Physically and spiritually!

03:57.819 --> 03:59.735
Louise, what exactly is this?

03:59.787 --> 04:01.238
It's grease or something.

04:01.239 --> 04:03.405
It was in a jar
Teddy left in the basement.

04:03.491 --> 04:04.741
(grunting quietly)

04:04.742 --> 04:06.075

I don't know. Why?

BOB: Because I'm stuck 
to the toilet!

BOB: (groaning) I can't get up.

04:15.092 --> 04:16.659
Louise, you glued me
to the toilet.

04:16.660 --> 04:19.661
It was supposed to be
slimy non-sticky goop,

04:19.663 --> 04:21.079

Oh, my God, Bob!

are coming!

I remember.

04:30.674 --> 04:33.509
God, I hate this stupid toilet
that Felix put in here!

It doesn't even have a seat.
It's Swiss.

nice prison toilet.

BOB: Louise, what if a customer
came in here?

04:39.182 --> 04:40.733
They would have sued.

04:40.734 --> 04:42.434
I'm your dad,
and I wanna sue you!

04:42.486 --> 04:44.353
What about Teddy? Sue him.

04:44.354 --> 04:46.821
Leaving his goop everywhere,
just taunting me with it.

‭Sticky Spackle!

Well, how do you get it off?

05:14.885 --> 05:16.384
You gotta use nail
polish remover.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.270
All right. I'll get
the nail polish remover,

05:18.271 --> 05:19.939

07:14.888 --> 07:16.839
Bob's got a big
magazine interview.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.591
What, are they writing
an article on guys with mustaches

07:18.592 --> 07:19.925
you wanna punch?

07:19.926 --> 07:22.011
Zoom! (chuckles)

07:22.012 --> 07:24.346

(panting)

Is he breathing?

07:59.933 --> 08:01.099
I rushed right over!

08:01.134 --> 08:02.634
Something's going on with Bob?

08:02.686 --> 08:04.303
No, no, no, it's just...

08:04.304 --> 08:05.938
um... the-the plumbing's
messed up.

08:05.939 --> 08:07.139
And, uh, Teddy's here to fix it.

08:07.140 --> 08:08.691
Um, Teddy, where are your tools?

08:08.692 --> 08:10.309
No time for tools, Linda!
Don't need 'em!

08:10.310 --> 08:11.192
BOB: Teddy! What are you doing?

08:11.277 --> 08:12.528
Don't worry, Bob.

08:12.529 --> 08:13.779
That was just a warm-up.

08:13.780 --> 08:15.030
I'm taking my shirt off now.

08:15.031 --> 08:16.281
This is the real deal!

08:16.282 --> 08:18.868
- I'm loose. I got this.
- BOB: Teddy, no!

08:18.952 --> 08:20.869
(roars)

08:20.870 --> 08:23.321
Oh, boy. ‭Okay. ‭Uh-oh.
‭Holy what the...

08:23.406 --> 08:24.873
Hi, everyone.

08:24.874 --> 08:26.374
Hi, Marshmallow.

08:26.459 --> 08:28.209
Hey, baby.
‭Ha!

08:28.294 --> 08:30.329
Bob's pooping in front
of his customers.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.464
Wrong, Jimmy!
He's not pooping.

08:32.465 --> 08:34.082
He's glued to the toilet.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.751
Bob's glued to the toilet?

08:36.753 --> 08:39.419
Oh... People need to see this!

08:39.506 --> 08:41.340
Jimmy!
Jimmy, where are you going?

08:41.341 --> 08:43.392
Hey, everybody in the world!

08:43.393 --> 08:45.344
Bob Belcher is stuck
to the toilet!

08:45.345 --> 08:46.679
Yeah! Yeah, you!

08:46.680 --> 08:47.731
Hey, over there!
Come here!

08:47.814 --> 08:48.897
Linda?

08:48.898 --> 08:51.818
Bob?
‭Kill me.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.811
Come on in, folks!

08:53.812 --> 08:56.155
Come see the sad man
stuck to the can!

08:56.156 --> 08:57.440
(laughs)

08:57.441 --> 08:58.691
It's hilarious.

08:58.692 --> 09:01.159
(people chattering)

09:01.245 --> 09:04.163
Gene, thanks for telling
everyone I'm glued to a toilet.

09:04.164 --> 09:05.781
I only told Jimmy Pesto.

09:05.833 --> 09:06.949
Jimmy Pesto told everyone.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.117
I did post it on social media,

09:08.118 --> 09:09.419
but people are cool there.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.036
They won't blab it up.

09:11.121 --> 09:13.339
Teddy, please tell me you can
get me off this toilet.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.957
Yes, I can.

09:14.958 --> 09:17.510
We just have to apply
and reapply nail polish remover

09:17.511 --> 09:19.462
to your legs and underbutt

09:19.463 --> 09:21.764
and, in a few hours...
voilà! You're free.

09:21.765 --> 09:24.300
A few hours?
That's the best you can do?

09:24.301 --> 09:27.103
Teddy, the guys from Coasters
are gonna be here before then!

09:27.104 --> 09:28.771
We gotta hurry!
JIMMY: Hey, Bob,

09:28.772 --> 09:30.189
if this is the dumbest thing

09:30.190 --> 09:31.557
that's ever happened
to you, flush once.

09:31.558 --> 09:33.810
(Jimmy snickers) Oh, God, Lin.

09:33.811 --> 09:35.227
Please close the restaurant.

09:35.312 --> 09:37.063
Bob, maybe this is good.

09:37.064 --> 09:38.731
When the guys from
Coasters get here,

09:38.732 --> 09:40.483
all they're gonna see
is a crowded restaurant.

09:40.484 --> 09:42.201
"Oh, there's a bunch of
people waiting in the street?

09:42.202 --> 09:43.486
"What are they waiting for?

09:43.487 --> 09:44.870
Must be Bob's Burgers!"

09:44.955 --> 09:46.488
Wait, there's people
in the street?

09:46.540 --> 09:48.374
No. Okay, a few.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.076
All right, a lot.
And a news truck. What?

09:50.077 --> 09:51.494
But we're gonna get
you off that toilet

09:51.495 --> 09:53.045
and ready for that interview.
Right, Teddy?

09:53.130 --> 09:54.664
I'm brushin' like
the wind, Linda.

09:54.665 --> 09:56.499
Gretchen can come in
here and do your hair.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.084
No. ‭And I'm gonna go upstairs

09:58.085 --> 09:59.669
and pick out a nice shirt
that shows off that...

09:59.670 --> 10:01.054
that you have shirts.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.338
I don't have shirts.

10:02.339 --> 10:03.973
Kids, guard the sheet door.

10:03.974 --> 10:05.674
TINA: You got it, Mom.
GENE: No one gets through this sheet!

10:05.759 --> 10:07.560
All right. And Gretchen,
you're in, let's go!

10:07.561 --> 10:09.011
Except Gretchen.

10:09.012 --> 10:11.514
Hi, Bob. Lookin' good.
Oh, my God.

10:11.515 --> 10:13.015
Oh, please.
Like I haven't done

10:13.016 --> 10:14.851
somebody's hair
on a toilet before.

10:14.852 --> 10:17.353
We're outside Bob's Burgers,
where a local grill cook

10:17.354 --> 10:19.906
has gone from rush order
to flush order.

10:19.907 --> 10:21.991
He's glued to
his restaurant's toilet.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.026
I'm here with another
local restaurateur.

10:24.027 --> 10:25.862
What's your take on this?

10:25.863 --> 10:27.530
This is the best day of my life.

10:27.531 --> 10:28.865
Oh, uh, I hate Bob.

10:28.866 --> 10:30.199
I should have started with that.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.034
Are we live?
Come to Jimmy Pesto's.

10:32.035 --> 10:33.535
Across the street.
It's delicious...

10:33.620 --> 10:34.921
Same thing happened to me.

10:34.922 --> 10:36.539
I was there for three weeks.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.874
I didn't call for help.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.459
I had self-respect.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.377
I drank toilet water
to stay alive.

10:41.378 --> 10:42.795
You flush, you drink.

10:42.796 --> 10:43.962
Anyone can do it.

10:43.963 --> 10:47.996
Ed ‭TEST TEST.

10:47.997 --> 10:49.936
Ey, I ‭TEST.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.187
Nothing to see here.

10:51.188 --> 10:52.889
Yeah, stand back, Lucy Lius.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.106
Five-foot perimeter.

10:54.191 --> 10:55.892
Hello, Belcher children.

10:55.893 --> 10:57.643
I need to get inside with Charac

10:57.644 --> 11:00.146
so he can do a portrait
of your father on the toilet.

11:00.147 --> 11:02.564
We're going to print them,
and we're gonna make a fortune.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.950
Oh, sure.

11:03.951 --> 11:05.201
Come right in.
That sounds great.

11:05.202 --> 11:07.068
Wrong!
Step off, big man.

11:07.154 --> 11:08.871
(chuckling): I assure you,

11:08.872 --> 11:10.406
it will be tasteful.

11:10.407 --> 11:11.707
No?

11:11.708 --> 11:13.075
No, I'm hearing no.
(clears throat)

11:13.076 --> 11:14.911
Uh, we're gonna
step away for a moment

11:14.912 --> 11:16.879
and have a little conference.
I'll be right back.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.381
Aah! We're running out of time.

11:18.382 --> 11:19.632
The magazine people
will be here soon.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.217
Shh!

11:21.218 --> 11:22.885
Don't worry your pretty
little bangs, all right?

11:22.886 --> 11:25.054
I got this handled.
I made a call.

11:25.055 --> 11:26.672
Not because it's my fault.
'Cause it's not.

11:26.673 --> 11:27.974
Who'd you call?
The Po-Po?

11:27.975 --> 11:29.174
That's what I call the Pope.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.927
Blue, yellow. Blue, yellow.

11:30.928 --> 11:32.093
I don't know. I don't know.

11:32.179 --> 11:33.596
Lin, just pick one.

11:33.597 --> 11:34.931
You've been doing this
for 45 minutes.

11:34.932 --> 11:36.265
You're distracting me.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.600
Now I gotta start over.

11:37.601 --> 11:38.901
Blue, yellow.
Blue, yellow.

11:38.902 --> 11:40.820
No, the yellow one
goes better with the toilet.

11:40.821 --> 11:42.772
Well, I'm not gonna be
on the toilet, right Teddy?

11:42.773 --> 11:44.072
How we doing?

11:44.107 --> 11:46.108
Uh, doing good, Bob.
Doing real good.

11:46.109 --> 11:47.243
(quietly): We're not doing good.

11:47.244 --> 11:48.828
Teddy, I can hear you.

11:48.829 --> 11:50.112
No, you can't.
The hair dryer's on.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.280
(quietly): This is a disaster.

11:51.281 --> 11:52.949
It's not working, Linda.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.499
The hair dryer is off, Teddy.
I can hear every...

11:54.585 --> 11:56.536
I can't hear you
over the hair dryer, Bobby!

11:56.537 --> 11:57.787
Teddy, it's off.

11:57.788 --> 11:59.455
Turn off the hair dryer!

11:59.456 --> 12:01.958
Oh, I might be getting a little
weird from the fumes, Bob.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.258
Are you getting
a little weird from the fumes?

12:03.293 --> 12:04.794
What's "Yappening?"

12:04.795 --> 12:06.179
Dr. Yap's in the bathroom.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.130
Yap? What are you doing here?

12:08.131 --> 12:09.681
I called him, Dad.
He's a fixer.

12:09.766 --> 12:11.384
He's gonna get you off of there.

12:11.385 --> 12:13.186
Let's see what's going on
down here.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.637
(sighs)
Louise, why would you call him?

12:14.638 --> 12:16.137
He's our dentist.

12:16.223 --> 12:19.141
Which is a type of doctor,
which is what you need.

12:19.142 --> 12:20.443
And a doctor's
a type of dentist.

12:20.477 --> 12:22.027
That is not true.

12:22.112 --> 12:24.197
And dentist comes
from the word "Al dente,"

12:24.198 --> 12:25.698
which means, "The dent."

12:25.699 --> 12:28.034
Bob, I work with
adhesives and solvents.

12:28.035 --> 12:30.203
I'm exactly the guy
you need right now.

12:30.204 --> 12:32.488
There is a very special,
harmless dental solvent

12:32.489 --> 12:34.574
that can quickly
and painlessly break down the glue

12:34.575 --> 12:35.825
under your tushy.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.076
Really? That's great.

12:37.077 --> 12:38.327
One problem.

12:38.328 --> 12:40.162
I do not currently have any,

12:40.163 --> 12:42.465
but what I could do is get
the necessary certifications,

12:42.466 --> 12:44.000
put in an order,
and have some delivered

12:44.001 --> 12:45.635
in the next two or three months.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.336
So, should I just
go ahead and do that?

12:47.337 --> 12:49.005
I'm a notary, if that helps.

12:49.006 --> 12:51.724
That's your plan?
I vouched for you, dentist.

12:51.725 --> 12:53.643
(sighs) We're dead.

12:53.644 --> 12:55.510
We're done.
You know, there is another option.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.429
There he is.
There's my boy.

12:57.514 --> 12:58.564
What is it?
What do you got, Yap?

12:58.565 --> 12:59.764
In the dental game,

12:59.850 --> 13:01.684
you tie a string around a tooth,

13:01.685 --> 13:02.851
and yank it out.

13:02.903 --> 13:04.352
- Oh, my God.
- Hear him out.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.905
You are the tooth,

13:05.906 --> 13:08.190
we numb your butt with Novocain,

13:08.191 --> 13:09.909
and we yank you off the toilet.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.445
Done. Dental day-um.

13:12.446 --> 13:14.697
Perfect.
This was ringing so I answered it.

13:14.698 --> 13:15.865
It's for Bob.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.283
It's probably Hollywood.

13:17.284 --> 13:18.701
(whispering):
Tell them I want Bette Midler

13:18.702 --> 13:20.002
to play me.

13:20.003 --> 13:21.120
Need Bette Midler

13:21.121 --> 13:22.337
to play me.
‭Hello?

13:22.372 --> 13:24.373
Bob! It's Skip Marooch.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.375
I'm on an all-terrain vehicle!

13:26.376 --> 13:29.210
I can go on any terrain
with this vehicle.

13:29.263 --> 13:30.596
Uh, that's great.

13:30.597 --> 13:32.514
Listen, you know
the Coasters guys?

13:32.549 --> 13:33.466
Yeah?

13:33.467 --> 13:34.767
I'm calling because I thought

13:34.768 --> 13:36.102
they were sending Brian,

13:36.103 --> 13:38.471
the nice Hidden Gems guy.
Uh-huh.

13:38.472 --> 13:40.773
Which would've been great,
but I just found out

13:40.774 --> 13:42.474
they're sending this guy,
Newton Fremont.

13:42.559 --> 13:44.810
- Okay.
- And...

13:44.811 --> 13:46.195
let's just say
he's a little tougher.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.064
Like, you know,
if he doesn't like you,

13:48.065 --> 13:49.565
you're not getting in
the magazine.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.399
But you'll be fine,
it'll be fine.

13:51.451 --> 13:53.069
Right.

13:53.070 --> 13:54.987
Could we maybe reschedule
with the nice guy

13:54.988 --> 13:56.238
for another day?

13:56.239 --> 13:57.907
That would actually work for me,

13:57.908 --> 13:59.708
'cause today's been,
you know, busy.

13:59.743 --> 14:01.493
No, Bob, they're on their way.

14:01.578 --> 14:02.795
That was the whole thing.

14:02.796 --> 14:04.580
They have to come today.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.332
Look, I didn't mean
to freak you out.

14:06.333 --> 14:09.050
You'll be great with your face
and your funny jokes.

14:09.086 --> 14:11.087
Well, it's just I'm... I-I...

14:11.088 --> 14:12.471
I'm stuck on a toilet.

14:12.472 --> 14:13.839
(laughs) See? Like that.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.256
So funny. Use that.

14:15.342 --> 14:17.225
No, like I actually
got glued to...

14:17.260 --> 14:18.811
Bob, I gotta call you back.

14:18.812 --> 14:20.930
I guess water does not
count as a terrain.

14:20.931 --> 14:22.597
I'm sinking.
Bye.

14:22.683 --> 14:25.267
Teddy, be honest with me.
How does it look?

14:25.268 --> 14:27.486
(crying):
It's just too much butt, Bob.

14:27.487 --> 14:29.938
Okay. Too much hair
all over your butt!

14:29.990 --> 14:31.490
Teddy, stop.

14:31.491 --> 14:33.325
All right,
we're doing Yap's plan.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.161
We order the solvent
that takes three months?

14:35.162 --> 14:36.745
That didn't sound
like a good idea.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.831
No, we tie a rope around me,

14:38.832 --> 14:40.498
and you all yank me
off the toilet.

14:40.584 --> 14:42.418
Yes!

14:42.419 --> 14:44.954
I knew there was a reason
we brought you into this project.

14:44.955 --> 14:46.275
Ah-Yap-Yap-Yap-Yap-Yap!
(chuckles)

14:46.289 --> 14:48.758
All right, let's numb that bum.

14:48.759 --> 14:51.127
Well, the Novocain
should be taking effect

14:51.128 --> 14:52.461
right about now.

14:52.462 --> 14:53.713
You feel that?
Huh?

14:53.714 --> 14:55.213
You feel that?
Gene, stop.

14:55.298 --> 14:56.297
Okay, you ready Bob?

14:56.299 --> 14:57.133
I think so.

14:57.134 --> 14:58.466
Dad, I love you.

14:58.518 --> 14:59.268
Thanks, Tina.

14:59.269 --> 15:00.720
I love you too, Dad.

15:00.721 --> 15:02.471
I love you for real.
Not like these posers.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.473
Bobby, I love you!
You'll always be my husband.

15:04.474 --> 15:05.640
I love you, Bob.

15:05.692 --> 15:07.143
I'm not dying,

15:07.144 --> 15:09.528
I'm just getting
my butt skin ripped off

15:09.529 --> 15:11.563
so I can be in a magazine.

15:11.648 --> 15:12.865
Okay, on the count of three,

15:12.866 --> 15:14.950
we all pull Bob off the toilet.

15:14.951 --> 15:16.702
Quick pro tip:
When we start yanking,

15:16.703 --> 15:18.079
ignore the screams.

15:19.322 --> 15:20.989
- One...
- Oh, my God.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.908
Two, buckle my shoe.

15:22.909 --> 15:25.044
Sorry, couldn't resist.
And three!

15:25.045 --> 15:28.664
(all groaning and straining,
Bob screaming)

15:28.665 --> 15:30.833
(continues screaming)
It's not working!

15:30.834 --> 15:32.585
It's not working!

15:32.586 --> 15:33.719
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

15:33.720 --> 15:35.504
It's gotta work.

15:35.505 --> 15:37.840
The guys from Coasters are gonna
be here any second.

15:37.841 --> 15:40.008
And... we're here.
The guys from Coasters.

15:40.093 --> 15:42.991
Uh, his eyes are up here.

15:46.802 --> 15:48.937
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

15:48.938 --> 15:50.772
Um, I don't knock on sheets

15:50.773 --> 15:52.506
'cause they're soft,
and they don't make a sound.

15:52.575 --> 15:55.310
I'm Newton Fremont, this is
my photographer Cory Battles.

15:55.311 --> 15:56.978
I'm here to shoot you. Ha.

15:56.979 --> 15:58.980
(chuckles) Nice one, Cory.
‭Thanks, Newt.

15:58.981 --> 16:00.981
And you must be undiscovered gem

16:01.033 --> 16:02.283
Bob Belcher.

16:02.284 --> 16:03.902
Uh, yeah, that's me.

16:03.903 --> 16:06.044
I'd get up, but I'm, uh,
stuck to a toilet.

16:06.121 --> 16:07.572
Yeah. So we hear.

16:07.573 --> 16:08.906
That's what the T-shirts
say outside.

16:08.991 --> 16:10.658
They're selling T-shirts?

16:10.659 --> 16:12.550
Do you know if they carry youth large?
Gene.

16:12.628 --> 16:13.962
Uh, I got a question:

16:13.963 --> 16:15.495
why are you stuck to a toilet?

16:15.548 --> 16:17.332
Well, uh, it's a...
kid's prank...

16:17.333 --> 16:18.666
gone very wrong.

16:18.667 --> 16:19.747
It was supposed to be Gene.

16:19.802 --> 16:22.887
Whoa. That's a-mazing.

16:22.888 --> 16:25.089
On the day. Of your interview.
With Coasters.

16:25.090 --> 16:27.057
This couldn't be worse.

16:27.142 --> 16:28.560
I... I, uh...

16:28.561 --> 16:30.260
Wait, are you taking pictures?

16:30.346 --> 16:32.563
A.B.C.
Always be clicking.

16:32.648 --> 16:34.231
But you aren't gonna use these
in the article, right?

16:34.316 --> 16:36.517
What? No. Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

16:36.518 --> 16:37.734
Oh, there's not gonna
be any article.

16:37.820 --> 16:38.902
(gasps) No!

16:38.988 --> 16:40.271
But look at his hair.

16:40.272 --> 16:41.438
Wait, don't look at the top.

16:41.523 --> 16:42.991
You can still talk to him.

16:42.992 --> 16:44.359
He's just on the toilet.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.610
Yeah!
I do it all the time!

16:45.611 --> 16:46.828
He doesn't expect
privacy anymore.

16:46.829 --> 16:47.995
We broke him.

16:48.030 --> 16:49.364
Here's the deal.

16:49.365 --> 16:50.615
We're doing a favor for Brian,

16:50.616 --> 16:51.866
who's doing a favor for Skip,

16:51.867 --> 16:53.701
so we barely care about this.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.620
Plus, we like to profile people

16:55.621 --> 16:57.422
who are unique and inspiring.

16:57.423 --> 16:58.673
You are unique.

16:58.674 --> 17:00.041
You are not inspiring.

17:00.042 --> 17:02.043
At all.
‭Yup.

17:02.044 --> 17:04.012
Also, Coasters magazine
is primarily read

17:04.012 --> 17:05.512
by people who are
sitting on the toilet.

17:05.513 --> 17:07.298
They do not want to
read about another guy

17:07.299 --> 17:09.384
who is also sitting on the toilet.
Got it.

17:09.385 --> 17:11.269
Plus, why haven't you
just taken the seat off?

17:11.270 --> 17:13.027
It doesn't have a seat.
‭lt's Swiss.

17:13.055 --> 17:14.055
That makes me sick.

17:14.056 --> 17:15.890
Hey, listen,

17:15.891 --> 17:17.392
this is just a crazy day.

17:17.393 --> 17:19.611
No, no, no, no, no.
It's fine.

17:19.612 --> 17:21.479
Actually, you know what?
This is perfect.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.397
Lin, this isn't a crazy day.

17:23.398 --> 17:26.451
This is a perfectly
average day at Bob's Burgers.

17:26.452 --> 17:28.736
This kind of stuff
happens all the time,

17:28.737 --> 17:31.039
and I'm so glad you came by
to take it in!

17:31.040 --> 17:32.990
(laughs crazily)

17:33.075 --> 17:36.077
Sorry we couldn't be
"inspiring" for you!

17:36.078 --> 17:37.879
I guess we just didn't
have it in us.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.130
So... good-bye!

17:39.131 --> 17:40.381
You can leave!

17:40.382 --> 17:41.715
Thanks for stopping in!

17:41.750 --> 17:43.418
Great outburst, Bob.

17:43.419 --> 17:44.892
Really great outburst.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.894
(mournful music plays)

17:48.924 --> 17:50.308
Excuse me.
Comin' through here, guys.

17:50.309 --> 17:51.592
Par... excuse me.
Pardon us.

17:51.593 --> 17:52.810
Pardon.
‭Heads up, guys.

17:52.811 --> 17:54.095
Pardon.
Whoa, cool shirt, man.

17:54.096 --> 17:56.431
What is that, marker?
Yeah. Permanent.

17:56.432 --> 17:57.931
No! No! Wait! Wait!
Don't leave,

17:58.017 --> 17:59.434
I wanna say something.

17:59.435 --> 18:01.486
What my dad said
is kind of true.

18:01.487 --> 18:03.688
Yeah, stuff goes wrong
all the time.

18:03.689 --> 18:05.239
But this thing today...

18:05.240 --> 18:07.742
(sighs)
you know... it was my fault.

18:07.743 --> 18:09.243
And if I hadn't done this,

18:09.244 --> 18:11.829
my dad would be walking
around here right now,

18:11.830 --> 18:13.665
inspiring the crap out
of people.

18:13.666 --> 18:16.117
He'd be making burgers...
really good burgers.

18:16.118 --> 18:17.452
Don't tell him I said that.

18:17.453 --> 18:19.003
We try not to compliment him.

18:19.004 --> 18:21.673
So, yeah, sorry, Dad.

18:21.674 --> 18:23.541
This is all my fault.

18:23.542 --> 18:24.709
BOB: What?

18:24.710 --> 18:26.294
I said it's all my fault!

18:26.295 --> 18:28.262
BOB: Oh. Okay.

18:28.263 --> 18:29.937
TEDDY: Everyone in here should
be ashamed of themselves.

18:29.965 --> 18:31.849
Standing around laughing at him.

18:31.850 --> 18:33.685
You see a guy stuck on a toilet

18:33.686 --> 18:35.970
and a shocking amount
of body hair.

18:35.971 --> 18:38.773
I see a beautiful toilet man.

18:38.774 --> 18:40.440
A toilet Bob.

18:40.476 --> 18:43.811
(chanting):
Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!

18:43.812 --> 18:45.446
CROWD (chanting): Toilet Bob!

18:45.447 --> 18:47.148
BOB: No. No.
Toilet Bob!

18:47.149 --> 18:48.782
Please don't chant that.
TEDDY: No, it's in a good way.

18:48.817 --> 18:51.652
Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!

18:51.653 --> 18:54.072
Come on, everybody!
Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!

18:54.073 --> 18:55.455
BOB: I don't like it.

18:55.491 --> 18:57.208
How about just Bob?
(chanting continues)

18:57.209 --> 18:59.159
Just coast on outta here,
Coasters.

18:59.211 --> 19:00.801
Toilet Bob!

19:00.829 --> 19:03.497
Toilet Bob! Toilet Bob!

19:03.582 --> 19:05.499
Toilet Bob! Ha, ha!

19:05.551 --> 19:06.833
Toilet Bob!

19:06.885 --> 19:08.184
(Bob screams)

19:10.389 --> 19:11.421
BOB: It worked.

19:11.507 --> 19:13.673
It finally worked!

19:13.726 --> 19:16.010
(cheering)

19:16.011 --> 19:17.344
BOB: I'm free! Yeah!

19:17.396 --> 19:18.980
Whoa. Whoa. Pins and needles.

19:18.981 --> 19:20.181
Can't feel my legs.

19:20.182 --> 19:21.848
Oh, going down.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.734
(cheering)

19:25.070 --> 19:26.410
(bell dinging)

19:26.488 --> 19:27.904
You guys want any of this stuff?

19:27.990 --> 19:29.022
Y-You mean our mail?

19:29.108 --> 19:30.358
Just asking, Bob.

19:30.359 --> 19:31.909
Don't snap at me.
‭Look!

19:31.910 --> 19:33.410
It's the latest issue
of Coasters!

19:33.495 --> 19:35.446
Linda, we're not in it...
they were very clear

19:35.447 --> 19:36.697
they weren't gonna
write about us,

19:36.698 --> 19:38.248
and I'm more
than okay with that.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.334
Oh, you're in it.
Oh, my God, we're in it.

19:40.335 --> 19:41.668
What?
‭Read it, Dad, read it!

19:41.703 --> 19:44.539
"Bob's Burgers is more
than an undiscovered gem.

19:44.540 --> 19:47.925
"It's truly a one-of-a-kind
mom-and-pop shop.

19:47.926 --> 19:50.378
"Celebrity chef Skip Marooch
swears that Bob's serves

19:50.379 --> 19:52.213
"the best burger
he's ever eaten.

19:52.214 --> 19:53.881
"We wouldn't know.

19:53.882 --> 19:55.348
"We didn't try the food.

19:55.384 --> 19:57.351
"But we did have a rather unique

19:57.352 --> 19:59.887
"and strangely inspiring
experience while we were there.

19:59.888 --> 20:04.058
"This shabby little dive seems
to hold a special spot

20:04.059 --> 20:06.694
in this dingy town's heart."

20:06.695 --> 20:09.397
Do you think they mean "dinghy" town?
I don't think there's a...

20:09.398 --> 20:11.615
No, that's not a thing...
dinghy town.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.317
Wow, that was kind of good.

20:13.318 --> 20:15.251
Louise, I-I think
you saved the day.

20:15.287 --> 20:16.904
Yeah, well, you know,

20:16.905 --> 20:18.539
this is the last time
I'm bailing you out, Dad.

20:18.540 --> 20:19.964
Hey, they didn't even
mention the toilet.

20:20.042 --> 20:20.908
Oh, yeah.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.292
Uh, keep reading.

20:22.377 --> 20:25.245
"Also, Bob got stuck
to the toilet." Oh.

20:25.297 --> 20:26.304
Now turn the page.

20:26.381 --> 20:27.414
Oh, there's a picture

20:27.499 --> 20:29.299
of me on the toilet in Coasters.

20:29.384 --> 20:31.252
"We could tell you
how that happened,

20:31.253 --> 20:33.337
"but do yourself a favor,
visit Bob's Burgers

20:33.338 --> 20:35.089
"and ask him yourself.

20:35.090 --> 20:38.475
Hopefully, he'll be back
on his feet by then."

20:38.560 --> 20:40.812
So... that's pretty
good, overall.

20:40.813 --> 20:42.763
Your hair looks good.

20:42.764 --> 20:43.930
Hey! This is the place!

Yeah, this is it. Come on in.
