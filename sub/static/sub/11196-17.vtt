WEBVTT

00:07.299 --> 00:09.718
No... Listen to me now.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.680
If you can't confirm my observations,
you must have the coordinates wrong,

00:13.805 --> 00:17.309
because there is definitely
something up there.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.145
For the tenth time, it is in Cassiopeia.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.857
Declination 61 degrees, six minutes.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.485
Right ascension two hours, 48 minutes.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.822
That's impossible.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.492
Yes, I'm sure.

00:35.118 --> 00:39.665
Listen. Listen, I am not some
crackpot phoning in a UFO here.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.709
I am the cofounder of
the Northern Susquenita County

00:42.876 --> 00:47.381
Amateur Astronomical Society. I've been
tracking this thing for three nights.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.509
Whatever it is, it is very big,
it is very close,

00:50.634 --> 00:54.805
and I will not shut up about this until...

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.528 --> 01:11.572
Never mind.

01:17.286 --> 01:22.124
This image was generated from satellite
observations made in the last few hours.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.293
The asteroid has an irregular shape,

01:24.418 --> 01:27.087
but we've calculated its length
from end to end

01:27.212 --> 01:29.756
to be approximately 137 kilometres.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.678
I've seen this movie. It hits Paris.

01:34.970 --> 01:39.600
It'll strike somewhere in the Arctic Circle.
Probably Greenland or the Barents Sea.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.644
Nobody knows this but us?
How is that possible?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.980
The asteroid was discovered by a civilian

01:45.105 --> 01:47.774
who's since been "persuaded"
to keep it quiet.

01:47.900 --> 01:52.905
The reason no one else has detected it
is that the object's path is highly atypical.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.407
It's outside the plane
of the solar system

01:55.532 --> 01:58.118
occupied by the planets
and the asteroid belt.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.580
In fact, it's a fluke that anyone
saw it at all. We got lucky.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.208
I don't see how in any way this is lucky.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.086
Well, seven or eight years ago,
there'd be nothing we could do about it.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.048
The Stargate opens other options for us.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.300
A little help from our friends?

02:13.550 --> 02:16.261
- Yes, sir.
- Perhaps the Tok'ra could assist.

02:16.386 --> 02:20.432
They've been on the run since the Goa'uld
attacked their base at Revanna.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.728
We've already sent a message asking for
their help. There hasn't been any reply.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.647
The Asgard owe us a favour.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.399
We could contact them through the K'Tau.

02:29.525 --> 02:34.238
The treaty with the Goa'uld means the
Asgard cannot prevent natural disasters.

02:34.363 --> 02:37.824
The Goa'uld tried to make the
Tollans send a bomb through the iris.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.578
- Screw the treaty.
- Well, one of our allies will help.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.622
I hope you're right.

02:43.747 --> 02:49.545
Otherwise, in 11 days and 16 hours,
all life on Earth will be wiped out.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.907
I'm afraid the answer is no.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.784
Come on, guys. Throw me a bone here.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.580
The Protected Planets Treaty
leaves no room for interpretation.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.624
They tried to attack us.

04:08.749 --> 04:13.587
It was the Tollans who attempted to send
the explosive device through your iris.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.880
By whose order?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.841
The System Lords
deny knowledge of this incident.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.135
Of course they deny it.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.848
The Treaty does allow
for the arbitration of such disputes.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.851
We would need to assemble
a commission of inquiry,

04:27.976 --> 04:32.773
consisting of equal numbers of
Asgard and Goa'uld representatives.

04:34.483 --> 04:38.111
We would also need corroborating
testimony from the Tollans.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.280
That's gonna be a problem,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.991
as they've been wiped out by the Goa'uld.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.576
That is unfortunate.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.539
And I suppose, when Earth gets hit
by that rock and we're all wiped out,

04:48.664 --> 04:51.041
that's gonna be unfortunate too?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.668
Very.

05:01.760 --> 05:07.182
- And after that I kind of lost my temper.
- What exactly does that mean?

05:07.599 --> 05:11.228
Let's just say Jack made
a reference to Freyr's mother.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.983
We'll discuss his diplomatic
shortcomings later.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.360
Right now I'd like to know our options.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.487
I say we nuke it ourselves.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.949
We have sufficiently large- yield
warheads to deflect it,

05:24.074 --> 05:27.828
but we don't have a delivery system
which can reach the asteroid in time.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.915
The cargo ship I crashed
on Revanna must still be there.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.792
In how many pieces?

05:33.917 --> 05:38.505
Our understanding of Goa'uld technology
has improved. We might be able to fix it.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.300
- How much time?
- With the right team, two days.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.760
I'll assign anyone you need, Major.

05:43.886 --> 05:47.139
Assuming we can fix it, how long
will it take to fly back to Earth?

05:47.264 --> 05:49.474
Revanna's not exactly next door.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.395
Even pushing the engines past 100%,
it would take eight, nine days.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.900
- Leaving little margin for error.
- Then let's get started. Dismissed.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.907
Colonel, I have every confidence
in SG-1's abilities.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.619
However, as a contingency plan,
the president has ordered me

06:08.785 --> 06:11.705
to begin Alpha team evacuations
through the gate.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.250
Major Davis will be arriving from
the Pentagon to coordinate.

06:15.626 --> 06:19.171
- Yes, sir.
- If Major Carter cannot repair the ship,

06:19.296 --> 06:23.550
you will report immediately to
the Alpha site and assume command.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.137
- General?
- No debates on this one. That's an order.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.183
Yeah.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.614
- Good to go, sir.
- Teal'c, show'em the way.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.076
This way.

06:49.201 --> 06:53.372
- This, uh... big enough?
- 1, 200 naqahdah- enhanced megatons.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.793
- That's a lot?
- It's the most powerful warhead there is.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.754
It's the equivalent of
one billion tons of TNT.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.800
That's a lot.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.344
Hey! What are you doing?

07:07.469 --> 07:11.181
I'm sorry, I can't do this. I can
give you a list of some good engineers.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.600
Come on, Spellman. I do this every day.

07:13.725 --> 07:17.771
You don't understand what happens to
your body when you go through it. I do.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.567
- We need you for this mission.
- It defies the laws of physics.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.735
Spellman, you're going.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.740
It doesn't look so bad.

08:09.865 --> 08:14.453
Our first priority is auxiliary power.
Then it's hyperdrive and life support.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.622
Right.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.667
Is there a rest room?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.588
My first priority.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.179
Ah, they'll fix it up.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.765
- I'm confident.
- Me too.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.933
As am I.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.712
I looked again. I still can't find it.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.339
- Did you check the guidance system?
- Twice.

09:49.464 --> 09:53.385
OK, I guess we'll have to assume
that there isn't one on board.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.266
- One what?
- We're ready to attempt an engine start.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.102
Yeah, fine. Assume there isn't one what?

10:02.477 --> 10:04.605
Recall device.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.859
The X- 301? That was you guys?

10:08.984 --> 10:11.111
You must admit it performed beautifully

10:11.236 --> 10:14.031
until you and Teal'c
were sent into... deep space.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.199
Yeah!

10:16.909 --> 10:18.202
Nice work.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.499
- Carter.
- Attempting engine start.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.191
Carter?

11:01.954 --> 11:07.459
That's got it, sir. We're good to go. I'll
repair the remaining systems on the way.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.588
Once you get to the Revanna gate, dial
the Alpha site. They're expecting you.

11:11.713 --> 11:16.093
I think I speak for about six billion people
when I say "good luck".

11:17.594 --> 11:19.638
You too.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.602
- I'm gonna wanna talk to you guys.
- Teal'c, try to take it easy on the engines.

11:25.727 --> 11:26.812
Why?

11:26.937 --> 11:30.607
I'm slightly concerned that if we
push them too hard and they burn out

11:30.732 --> 11:33.610
before we reach escape velocity,

11:35.737 --> 11:38.031
we'll come crashing back to the planet.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.997
- I'm confident.
- Me too.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.666
As am I.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.724
I appreciate that, but if
we don't hear from SG-1...

12:03.849 --> 12:07.102
- We're getting a message, sir. It's SG-1.
- You were saying?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.480
The signal's being relayed through
AF SATCOM. Audio only.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.400
- Pipe it through, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.779
Please respond.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.533
SG-1. This is General Hammond.
Please respond.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.244
Sir, we've just
dropped out of hyperspace.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.830
We should reach the asteroid
in a few minutes.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.124
We're relieved to hear that, Major.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.793
You sent engineers
to the Alpha site ten days ago.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.216
The ship's barely flying as it is, sir.
We're lucky we made it this far.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.093
Understood. Proceed with your mission.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.262
Yes, sir.

12:45.349 --> 12:50.604
All right. 39 minutes before impact, the
asteroid will reach the fail- safe position.

12:50.812 --> 12:55.275
After that point, it'll be too close
to Earth for the explosion to deflect it.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.986
That leaves us three and a half hours.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.405
So we just drop off the bomb and... what?

13:02.574 --> 13:07.162
Our scans show that the asteroid
is pitted with impact craters and fissures.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.583
We fly the ship into the deepest crater we
can find at a right angle to its trajectory.

13:11.917 --> 13:16.713
The crater should direct the explosive
force of the bomb like a rocket nozzle.

13:16.922 --> 13:20.551
When we're just above the surface,
we bring down the MALP with the bomb.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.679
Then we land, and two of us go EVA.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.514
That would be you and me.

13:25.639 --> 13:30.394
We walk the MALP down into a fissure at
the bottom of the crater to focus the blast.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.939
We set the timer
and then we get out of there.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.776
- Piece of cake.
- There is one other thing.

13:37.860 --> 13:42.281
We're about to pass through the Leonids:
a cometary trail Earth crosses sometimes.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.658
The shields should help protect the ship.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.036
Anyone caught outside
is gonna have to find cover, and fast.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
What was that?

13:54.918 --> 13:58.213
I'm having difficulty
with the sub- light engines.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.761
Yes, you are.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.555
Sir?

14:21.111 --> 14:24.406
- What is it?
- An overload in the control systems.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.619
- Backups?
- We don't have any.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.085
Sir, we just lost SG-1's signal.

14:41.507 --> 14:44.301
SG-1, this is Hammond. Do you read me?

14:45.427 --> 14:47.971
SG-1, please respond.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.021
How's the head?

14:58.982 --> 15:02.402
The sub- light engines have shut down.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.906
Big asteroid problem here.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.291
Try using manoeuvring thrusters
to slow us down.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.460
I am. It's not working.

15:24.466 --> 15:28.136
Daniel is correct. Manoeuvring
thrusters appear to be insufficient.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.764
They're all we've got.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.353
Sir! Deep- space tracking
still has a fix on the ship,

15:36.478 --> 15:40.023
but we show them approaching
the asteroid way too fast.

15:46.864 --> 15:50.284
- Any time now.
- The thrusters are in full reverse, O'Neill.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.870
- We're coming in faster than we should.
- Yes.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.248
Faster than we should
with thrusters at maximum.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.417
90 metres per second.

15:59.459 --> 16:04.173
80. This rate of deceleration
isn't gonna cut it. We're gonna hit.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.987
- What happened?
- We're inside a deep crater.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.407
50 metres per second.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.117
40.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.872
30.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.016
We stopped descending.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.105
No, I understand. Thank you.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.777
Sir?

17:06.902 --> 17:10.113
We got a message from NASA.
According to their calculations,

17:10.239 --> 17:14.409
SG-1 has crashed into the asteroid
at over 60 metres per second.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.205
- Do they have confirmation?
- No, sir.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.709
It's an estimate based on
the ship's last known position.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.255
Any chance of survivors?

17:27.464 --> 17:30.342
At that velocity, sir, it's...

17:30.467 --> 17:32.553
it's very unlikely.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.059
Sir.

17:40.310 --> 17:45.065
If this is true, and the mission is down,

17:47.234 --> 17:50.112
we're out of options.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.199
It's time to call the president.

18:05.169 --> 18:08.881
- The sub- light drive is down.
- As are shields and communications.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.675
It might be easier to list what is working.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.179
- The bomb?
- It's good to go, sir.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.057
If it comes right down to it,
we can detonate it right here.

18:19.183 --> 18:22.769
- What's our position?
- Personally, I'm against it.

18:22.895 --> 18:26.398
We're about five metres above
the surface at the bottom of the crater.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.610
The rings will be functional
at that distance.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.196
All right. Here goes.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.585
Let's suit up.

18:51.924 --> 18:55.052
- Carter, you all right?
- I'm fine, sir.

18:56.053 --> 18:59.681
You took a pretty good shot.
Why don't you sit this one out?

18:59.932 --> 19:03.519
- No, I'm fine. Really.
- Teal'c and I can handle it.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.687
Yes, sir.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.695
No, sir. There's been
no response on the radio.

19:13.820 --> 19:18.992
If they crashed, there should have been
visible evidence. We've found nothing.

19:20.702 --> 19:25.082
Frankly, sir, if SG-1 survived and they
manage to complete their mission,

19:25.207 --> 19:28.836
then no one needs to know
any of this ever happened.

19:28.961 --> 19:34.883
If not, nothing anyone can do will
make the slightest bit of difference.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.220
Going public now would
only serve to create panic.

19:40.556 --> 19:42.724
Yes, sir. I know how you feel.

19:42.850 --> 19:44.893
My place is here.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.729
Thank you, Mr President.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.923
Depressurising airlock.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.177
You'll experience
very little gravity.

20:18.635 --> 20:22.139
The asteroid's surface is mostly iron
and your boots are magnetised,

20:22.264 --> 20:25.142
so you shouldn't go
spinning off into space.

20:25.267 --> 20:29.438
That's very reassuring, Carter.
Thank you very much.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.942
Depressurisation complete.
Opening outer door.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.141
I'll drive.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.306
What is it?

22:27.431 --> 22:31.685
Our approach was a lot faster than it
should have been, even on thrusters only.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.854
I wanna check something.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.579
We can proceed no further.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.334
Then this'll do.

23:11.934 --> 23:14.144
Weapon is armed.

23:26.490 --> 23:31.203
Something's not right. The gravitational
field is stronger than we thought.

23:31.829 --> 23:32.913
So?

23:33.163 --> 23:37.543
Gravity is determined by mass. Mass
is determined by size and composition.

23:37.668 --> 23:38.335
So?

23:38.460 --> 23:42.506
So the core must be made of something
a lot heavier than nickel and iron.

23:42.631 --> 23:45.092
What was that?

23:47.219 --> 23:50.430
We're passing through the Leonids
sooner than I expected.

23:50.556 --> 23:53.225
Colonel O'Neill, what's your position?

23:53.350 --> 23:56.019
We're almost out of the cave.

23:56.645 --> 24:00.691
Better stay where you are, sir.
We're taking meteor hits.

24:02.651 --> 24:06.071
Carter, any chance of getting
those shields in play here?

24:06.405 --> 24:08.323
We're working on it, sir. Stand by.

24:08.448 --> 24:12.411
Daniel, try to reroute
power from the hyperdrive.

24:12.536 --> 24:14.997
Bypass systems are all blown.

24:19.585 --> 24:22.379
Hull breach! We're venting atmosphere!

24:37.352 --> 24:39.396
Carter.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.983
Any progress on those shields?

24:43.108 --> 24:45.152
Stand by, sir.

24:58.749 --> 25:00.000
That's it.

25:02.878 --> 25:05.255
And now there's two more.

25:05.756 --> 25:09.885
Carter! Daniel!
This is O'Neill. Please respond.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.724
Carter!

25:32.324 --> 25:34.660
It appears the meteor storm has subsided.

25:34.785 --> 25:36.411
Go.

25:46.922 --> 25:50.342
Carter! Carter! Daniel!

25:51.927 --> 25:53.303
Report!

26:03.272 --> 26:08.819
O'Neill, these readings indicate
zero atmosphere within the ship.

26:10.362 --> 26:11.655
Hull breach?

26:11.780 --> 26:15.117
If that is the case, Carter and Daniel
could not have survived.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.953
Open it.

27:08.754 --> 27:10.547
I got nothin', Teal'c.

27:15.093 --> 27:18.180
The hull has been
damaged in several places.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.532
What are you considering, O'Neill?

27:53.340 --> 27:55.717
They're in the escape pods.

27:57.761 --> 28:01.265
I have identified
the breached areas of the hull.

28:01.890 --> 28:04.434
We can begin repairs immediately.

28:12.985 --> 28:14.361
All right.

28:17.197 --> 28:20.951
- General.
- Doctor. Shouldn't you be offworld?

28:21.285 --> 28:25.205
I'm leaving with the next group, sir.
Your name isn't on the list, sir.

28:26.331 --> 28:29.168
- That's correct.
- May I ask why?

28:29.293 --> 28:32.838
If that asteroid hits, the only chance
for the survival of the human race

28:32.963 --> 28:35.090
will rest with the Alpha site.

28:35.215 --> 28:39.219
We limited their number because
they'll have limited resources.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.763
Everyone will have to contribute.

28:41.889 --> 28:45.726
Your experience makes you
more than qualified, sir.

28:47.352 --> 28:52.900
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
Doctor. But my decision is final.

28:55.319 --> 28:57.362
Yes, sir.

29:19.343 --> 29:22.221
- How you feelin'?
- Not bad.

29:22.346 --> 29:26.558
- That's great. Let's go.
- Sir, I don't think we should leave just yet.

29:27.351 --> 29:29.645
Somethin' to do with gravity.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.356
It's too high. Higher than it should be.

29:32.731 --> 29:36.151
I need to reconfigure the sensors
to find what the core is made of.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.570
- Oh, here we go!
- I'm sorry, sir.

29:38.695 --> 29:42.074
Oh, come on!
We came, we saw, we planted the bomb.

29:42.199 --> 29:46.954
We had a little fun with a meteor shower,
we went home. It's a great story.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.165
Isn't it?

30:01.093 --> 30:02.719
I was right.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.514
- This could be a problem.
- Indeed.

30:05.639 --> 30:07.349
I don't wanna hear it.

30:07.474 --> 30:11.812
Sir, the asteroid's core is composed
almost entirely of naqahdah.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.689
Of course it is.

30:14.982 --> 30:18.986
- It makes up 45 per cent of the mass.
- Of course it does.

30:19.111 --> 30:21.780
Naqahdah does not occur naturally.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.783
Which is why I never
even thought to look for it.

30:24.908 --> 30:27.244
Sir, this must've been a Goa'uld setup.

30:27.369 --> 30:31.874
To betray the Protected Planets Treaty
with the Asgard is almost unthinkable.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.292
What?

30:33.417 --> 30:38.255
The Goa'uld set the asteroid on a collision
course to look like a natural disaster.

30:38.380 --> 30:42.009
They knew the only way
we could stop it would be with a nuke.

30:42.134 --> 30:45.429
So... what happens
when that bomb goes off?

30:45.554 --> 30:50.309
The explosion will be enhanced by the
naqahdah, to the force of a small nova.

30:50.434 --> 30:54.479
This close to Earth, it'd be enough to set
the atmosphere on fire and boil the seas.

30:54.605 --> 30:58.233
- OK. This was not in the movie.
- If we deactivate the bomb,

30:58.358 --> 31:02.821
and the asteroid passes the fail- safe point,
there's no turning back. Are you sure?

31:02.946 --> 31:05.240
Well, I... I can't be 100 per cent...

31:05.574 --> 31:07.534
We don't have a lot of choices here.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.704
We're damned if we do
and we're damned if we don't.

31:10.829 --> 31:14.708
The asteroid itself may be
sufficient evidence of a treaty violation.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.753
Right. The Asgard can intervene.

31:17.836 --> 31:21.131
- We have no way to tell them.
- We do if you get that radio on line.

31:21.256 --> 31:23.300
Teal'c, suit up.

31:40.651 --> 31:42.653
OK, try it now.

31:42.778 --> 31:46.657
Stargate Command, this is SG-1.
Do you read? Over.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.620
Nothing.

31:55.165 --> 31:58.710
I don't know what else to do.
The radio's working short- range,

31:58.836 --> 32:02.756
but there's no way the signal can
penetrate this much solid naqahdah.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.942
Ah, crap!

32:50.721 --> 32:53.390
The bomb has yet to be deactivated.

32:54.308 --> 32:56.685
I can see that, Teal'c.

33:09.114 --> 33:11.366
Perhaps the code is incorrect.

33:11.492 --> 33:15.412
Yeah. Carter, come in.

33:16.914 --> 33:20.542
- Go ahead.
- Confirm the deactivation code for me.

33:22.085 --> 33:25.714
03310310.

33:32.804 --> 33:35.307
Yeah, that's it. Nothin'.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.769
- Is there a problem, sir?
- There was a cave- in.

33:38.894 --> 33:42.856
Seems to have damaged the keypad.
It's not accepting the code.

33:42.981 --> 33:45.776
Other than that, everything's... fine.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.948
- How much time is left exactly?
- Under three minutes.

33:52.950 --> 33:56.829
Sir, you're gonna have to open up
the bomb and deactivate it manually.

34:12.803 --> 34:18.266
First remove the casing around the timer.
There should be two screws.

34:18.391 --> 34:20.435
Yeah. I got'em.

34:36.952 --> 34:37.786
Got it.

34:37.911 --> 34:42.541
Now find the wires leading from the timer
to the detonator, and cut the red one.

34:50.591 --> 34:53.760
Carter. They're all yellow.

34:57.054 --> 35:00.475
- Say again.
- There are five wires, all yellow.

35:02.227 --> 35:06.607
- Maybe I should cut'em all.
- Sir, if you interrupt the wrong circuit,

35:06.732 --> 35:10.235
it's the same as telling the bomb
the timer has reached zero.

35:11.028 --> 35:12.446
Yeah. I knew that.

35:12.863 --> 35:17.326
I'm sorry, sir, but you're just
gonna have to cut them randomly.

35:17.993 --> 35:19.536
Yeah. I knew that too.

35:49.691 --> 35:52.778
- How's it coming, sir?
- I've cut three.

35:54.279 --> 35:56.156
I've got two to go.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.587
I'd like to take this opportunity to say...

36:10.712 --> 36:16.134
this is a poorly designed bomb, and we
should say something when we get back.

36:17.219 --> 36:19.263
I agree, sir.

36:36.196 --> 36:38.115
Sir?

36:40.200 --> 36:42.244
We're still here.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.714
20 seconds to fail- safe.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.677
Still no word from SG-1?

36:59.386 --> 37:01.388
No, sir.

37:04.099 --> 37:06.351
Ten seconds.

37:17.571 --> 37:20.115
Asteroid has passed fail- safe.

37:20.741 --> 37:26.330
Very well. Major, Sergeant, take your
positions with the last Alpha group.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.667
That's an order, Sergeant.

37:32.836 --> 37:34.880
Yes, sir.

37:39.843 --> 37:41.470
General.

37:42.471 --> 37:45.390
I haven't been relieved
of this command, Major.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.728
Yes, sir.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.067
Good luck.

38:04.743 --> 38:07.454
We get communications back yet?

38:07.579 --> 38:10.791
Sorry, sir. The only way would be
to pull the components

38:10.916 --> 38:14.503
we used to fix the hyperdrive.
It would take hours.

38:14.628 --> 38:17.130
- What, then?
- Well, we have a couple of options.

38:17.256 --> 38:21.593
Number one, give up. Use what's left of
the power to get to the nearest gateworld.

38:21.718 --> 38:24.137
We might make it.
Then we head to the Alpha site.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.932
- Number two?
- We take off and hope that our signal

38:27.057 --> 38:31.520
can be picked up by the Asgard in time
to inform them this was a Goa'uld attack.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.314
- There's not enough time for that.
- I know.

38:35.315 --> 38:38.360
- Is... there a number three?
- There's no three.

38:38.485 --> 38:43.490
Maybe there is. Teal'c, you said naqahdah
wasn't native to our solar system.

38:43.615 --> 38:46.535
Which means the Goa'uld
must've towed it by ship.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.163
- A mothership.
- Daniel, that's it.

38:49.830 --> 38:52.040
- What's it?
- We don't have a mothership.

38:52.166 --> 38:56.295
- It only has to last a few seconds.
- What only has to last a few seconds?

38:56.420 --> 39:01.466
Choice three, sir. Expand our hyperspace
field to encompass the entire asteroid.

39:01.592 --> 39:06.763
We take it out of normal space long
enough to avoid the collision with Earth.

39:09.308 --> 39:14.563
- Is there a four?
- I know it sounds far- fetched, and... it is.

39:14.688 --> 39:18.525
- Ride an asteroid... through Earth?
- Yes.

39:18.650 --> 39:23.113
To the observer, it would disappear
on one side and reappear on the other.

39:23.238 --> 39:26.074
The problem is it'd take
every ounce of power we've got.

39:26.200 --> 39:30.037
The field would have to be expanded
far beyond its usual envelope.

39:30.162 --> 39:34.333
- It could cause the engines to explode.
- Explode?

39:34.458 --> 39:38.128
Even if we survived the engine overload,
we couldn't take off again.

39:38.504 --> 39:42.883
We'd have a couple of hours
of life support, and that's it.

39:43.383 --> 39:47.262
But you think this is... the best shot
we have at stoppin' this rock?

39:47.846 --> 39:50.432
Yes, sir. I think so.

39:55.145 --> 39:57.564
Well, that's the plan, then.

40:18.919 --> 40:22.422
I really need more time
to make the calculations.

40:26.260 --> 40:29.304
Well, Carter, now might be a good time.

40:30.013 --> 40:31.932
Almost.

40:32.975 --> 40:34.434
Now?

40:34.560 --> 40:38.689
If I engage too soon,
we'll reappear right inside the Earth.

40:46.029 --> 40:48.866
Carter, I can see my house.

40:48.991 --> 40:52.411
Engaging hyperdrive... now.

41:11.180 --> 41:12.431
We're there.

41:12.556 --> 41:16.143
The computer confirms
we have emerged from hyperspace

41:16.268 --> 41:19.021
on the other side of the planet.

41:22.232 --> 41:23.650
Yep.

41:23.775 --> 41:25.986
Plan three.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.363
Works every time.

41:33.744 --> 41:36.455
Yes, Mr President.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.665
Yes, sir.

41:38.790 --> 41:43.962
From what NASA and SATCOM tell me,
it looks like the asteroid just disappeared.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.926
I don't know, sir,
it may have been the Asgard.

41:49.051 --> 41:52.846
But it's my opinion
SG-1 had something to do with it.

41:58.644 --> 42:01.813
So... two hours of life support, then what?

42:03.649 --> 42:05.859
Hammond'll find us.

42:06.610 --> 42:09.613
- I'm confident.
- Me too.

42:12.324 --> 42:14.368
As am I.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.750
The sensors are picking up
a vessel approaching.

42:21.875 --> 42:25.712
- It appears to be another cargo ship.
- Goa'uld?

42:25.838 --> 42:30.050
I do not know. The ship is taking up
position directly above us.

42:30.717 --> 42:36.807
I'm Jalen, of the Tok'ra. We received your
distress call. Can we render assistance?

42:38.892 --> 42:44.648
Well, you know, it's not like we don't have
everything totally under control here,

42:44.773 --> 42:46.400
but...

42:47.818 --> 42:50.070
Sure. Render away.
