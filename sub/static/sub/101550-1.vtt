02:47.950 --> 02:49.778
-Shut up.
-All right.

02:49.908 --> 02:52.302
Seriously, who are you
and what have you done
with my girlfriend?

02:55.436 --> 02:57.699
Oh, my God!
This is so beautiful!

02:57.829 --> 02:59.657
Hey, you're getting snow
all over the carpet.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.920
-I thought you grew up
around here.
- <i>House party</i>

03:02.051 --> 03:04.314
-Oh, my God. You gonna help me?
- <i>House party</i>

03:04.445 --> 03:06.186
<i>-Party's over here,
party's over here <i>
-</i>You're not gonna help me.</i>

03:06.316 --> 03:07.752
Go find the water heater
or something.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.319
<i>-You're not invited
-Make yourself useful.</i>

03:09.450 --> 03:11.669
- <i>You're not invited
-Jesus Christ.</i>

03:11.800 --> 03:14.716
Help me out.
It's like I'm dating
a pinball machine.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.894
Honey, it's fine.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.417
-I'm sure she's fine.
-I'm just worried.

03:20.548 --> 03:21.940
What if they're actually
not feeding her
or something?

03:22.071 --> 03:24.160
Isn't it like a chichi place?

03:24.291 --> 03:28.208
Don't they send you photos
of the dogs getting manicures
so you know they're okay?

03:28.338 --> 03:31.036
-I know, but Selena's a very...
-It's two days.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.997
It's literally two days, okay?
Chihuahua's not gonna starve
to death.

03:35.127 --> 03:38.479
You need to chill, all right?
You're being very LA right now.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.828
Do not tell me to chill.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.004
Okay.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.574
I'm saying, hey,
aren't you seeing them
this weekend?

03:46.704 --> 03:48.880
We'll knock him out.
Dude's a faggot.
He's got nothing.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.099
It was a cheap shot.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.622
-Hey, you coming?
-Excuse me.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.581
You guys, where are we going?
We're going to Porter's?

03:53.711 --> 03:54.538
Excuse me.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.975
Please don't do this.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.499
You mind keeping it down?

03:59.848 --> 04:01.197
What's up?

04:01.328 --> 04:03.112
We're eating.
You mind keeping it down?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.983
-Yeah, and we're talking.
-I noticed.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.377
You're using some pretty
nasty slurs there, tough guy.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.292
-PJ! PJ, please.
-What's up?

04:09.423 --> 04:12.339
-You got a problem with me?
-No, I got a question.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.690
-Is it gonna be a rude question?
-No, it's not.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.169
Okay, what's your question?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.041
You guys have the Internet
in this town?

04:19.171 --> 04:20.347
You should try it out,
it's fantastic.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.739
You could teach your moms
how to read.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.918
Hey, stop.

04:27.049 --> 04:30.313
Look, we're sorry.
You have a nice night,
all right?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.761
That was extremely,
extremely stupid of you.

04:43.892 --> 04:47.809
It's just that word.
It's just that one word,
I wouldn't have said anything.

04:48.766 --> 04:51.203
What if my brother was here?

04:53.075 --> 04:54.642
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

04:59.690 --> 05:00.778
I know.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.433
Fucking unbelievable.

05:39.208 --> 05:42.907
"First knob on your left.

05:43.038 --> 05:44.648
"Can't miss it."

05:46.781 --> 05:48.348
Clearly, I can miss it.

05:55.964 --> 05:56.965
Fuck!

06:33.262 --> 06:34.698
Will you go start the shower?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.265
You're so hot.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.921
-Will you whistle for me?
-Yeah.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.444
I'm gonna close this.

06:41.575 --> 06:42.402
Okay.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.402
Brianne?

07:38.022 --> 07:40.198
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:02.830
Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.396
Hi, John.

08:04.527 --> 08:07.661
I see a couple
of new faces here.
Welcome.

08:07.791 --> 08:11.142
I've been with the program now
for six years.
Sober for three.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.317
We're no saints.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.494
Yeah, that's right.
We're no saints.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.321
I got drunk for the first time,
I was 15 years old...

08:16.452 --> 08:17.975
and I turned to the kid
next to me,
I guess, and I said...

08:18.106 --> 08:20.717
"This is what normal people
must feel like."

08:22.110 --> 08:24.112
I'm not good with anger.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.462
Backseat drivers.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.030
My ex-wife, she... Woof.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.512
You met her.

08:32.642 --> 08:35.253
She's the mother of my daughter,
I can never say a cross word
against her...

08:35.384 --> 08:38.648
but she can be
a real fucking piece of work.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.433
Some nights I get so angry
even just thinking about it...

08:41.564 --> 08:44.262
I get these crazy ideas about...

08:44.393 --> 08:48.092
renting a backhoe,
setting it up on her lawn,
putting it in drive...

08:48.223 --> 08:51.400
and just watching it crawl
through her house slowly.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.664
Not to hurt anybody, obviously,
but just to have...

08:54.795 --> 08:57.014
somebody acknowledge
that I'm here.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.977
Ronnie made oatmeal cookies.
So, everybody thank Ronnie.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.979
Yeah, sure, dive in.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.416
But I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for the 12 Steps.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.246
And I'm living proof
that if you can just focus...

09:11.376 --> 09:15.380
If you can just focus
and not let the monsters
inside of you come out...

09:15.511 --> 09:18.209
If you can just concentrate
on the 12 Steps...

09:18.340 --> 09:21.125
and becoming
a better person every day...

09:22.126 --> 09:23.301
then you can...

09:24.085 --> 09:25.347
What's the problem?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.131
I'm sorry.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.614
What's the problem?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.835
I don't hear people.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.321
We getting prints here?

09:43.452 --> 09:47.282
Yes, Sheriff. We've got hers
and the boyfriend's.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.501
But they're also collecting
them in the house right now.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.938
It's a rental,
so there's hundreds.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.417
Any neighbors?

09:52.548 --> 09:55.290
We got people knocking.
I know this family over here.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.292
Any signs of sexual abuse?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.424
Could you have Officer Robson
fill you in on that, Sheriff?

09:59.555 --> 10:01.252
We have a lot of work here.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.777
You can answer that question.
I may look old
but I can handle it.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.474
Any sign of sexual abuse?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.217
Sheriff, that part of the
crime scene is missing
at the moment.

10:09.347 --> 10:12.046
Do you mind speaking to
Officer Robson about that?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.093
We gotta shut down the road.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.573
Yes, sir. We're working on it.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.183
Help me get out of here.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.881
Hey, can we get a car
for Sheriff?

10:21.011 --> 10:22.186
Got it.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.058
What else we got here?
We notify the families?

10:24.188 --> 10:25.712
We're still collecting here.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.539
We got someone to head to the 76
to pull tapes from the seats.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.063
What happened to the boyfriend?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.631
We put him in a cruiser
back to the city.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.763
Never heard somebody say
"Oh, my God" so many times.

10:33.894 --> 10:34.895
Gotta call Jenna.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.331
-Why is that?
-What?

10:36.461 --> 10:37.724
Why do you have
to call your daughter?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.290
I didn't say that. Did I?

10:39.421 --> 10:40.770
Okay, I need everybody's
cooperation.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.077
No, we're cooperating.
You're not cooperating, okay?

10:43.207 --> 10:44.556
Can we have somebody else
talk to us? You don't know
what you're talking about.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.949
-No, sir, I'm in charge.
-Handle that.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.385
Yeah, you're doing
a fucking dynamite job.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.909
Hey, your best man over here
isn't telling us shit.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.172
He just took our phones away,
which is illegal.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.130
What am I gonna have to do?
Rent this place out
as a haunted house?

10:53.261 --> 10:54.697
My wife's gonna fucking kill me.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.960
Excuse me.
They said there was
a chemical spill.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.788
Are my dogs gonna be okay?

10:58.919 --> 11:00.398
-I'm sorry. They said what?
-I did say it was
a chemical spill.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.183
Ma'am, your dogs
are gonna be fine.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.967
Will you two keep me in on this?

11:04.098 --> 11:05.839
Yeah. Never a dull moment.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.188
Hell of a last quarter
for you, Sheriff.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.364
God, I thought
it was a car accident.

11:09.494 --> 11:13.455
You get this guy, bring him in
and get everybody on it.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.196
I'm not sure we gotta...
You know what...

11:15.326 --> 11:17.285
Yeah, thank you
so much, Sheriff.
We're gonna look into that.

11:30.341 --> 11:33.257
<i>Now we have only
about one homicide <i>
every two years.</i></i>

11:33.388 --> 11:34.911
<i>This is an isolated incident.</i>

11:35.042 --> 11:37.305
<i>We are making strides
to find suspects...</i>

11:37.435 --> 11:39.699
<i>so no one in Snow Hollow
should be worried about this.</i>

11:39.829 --> 11:42.614
<i>District Attorney's office
is gonna bring these killers <i>
to justice.</i></i>

11:42.745 --> 11:44.268
All right, now let me hear
what you got.
Read that back.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.097
"Currently pursuing all leads,
isolated incident.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.056
"The killers gonna be
brought to justice.
Police making strides."

11:49.186 --> 11:50.927
Yeah, that's good. Okay.
When are you gonna publish that?

11:51.058 --> 11:52.973
Well, we're weekly.
So, I mean, tomorrow.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.583
-Good.
-Sheriff, anything else
you can tell us?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.325
I mean, some of your guys
are calling this a massacre.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.022
Massacre? Wait a minute.
Who said that?

11:59.153 --> 12:00.763
-Not one of my guys.
-No, I'm afraid we can't.
Sorry, boys.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.025
We'll see you in the basement
on Sunday?

12:02.156 --> 12:03.679
I don't know.
Are you gonna catch these guys?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.550
Hundred percent.
You can take that to the bank.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.248
I'll see you
in the basement, Ricky.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.379
Yeah, let's hope so.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.511
-Wait, wait. Hey, Ricky.
-No, Sheriff.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.426
What are
all these little comments?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.733
-Why you doing this?
I hear these things.
-Sheriff. Sheriff. Sheriff.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.691
Sorry, Sheriff.
I got a nine-year-old.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.781
Well, you're acting
like a nine-year-old.
This is a tragedy.

12:18.912 --> 12:22.132
Now just publish your
damn story already and...

12:22.263 --> 12:24.047
have a nice day.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.182
Shut the door.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.143
Did they notice anything?
Did I seem together?

12:33.274 --> 12:34.405
You did fine.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.277
I feel like
I've been having a heart attack.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.192
No, you did fine.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.410
Wait, you said you feel like
you're having a heart attack
right now?

12:39.541 --> 12:42.544
No, since about August.
Did I do all right?

12:42.674 --> 12:43.980
I don't want them
to think I was, you know...

12:44.111 --> 12:46.766
Dad, you did fine.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.812
I take you're not
gonna slow me down.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.815
Look at that photograph
out there all blown up.

12:52.946 --> 12:57.124
Good guys locking up
the bad guys.
There's the old crowd.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.954
Yeah, I remember
a bank robbery in 1979.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.740
Got the head man on the phone.
He was so mad.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.612
Got his daughter down here,
put her on the bullhorn.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.093
He cried like a baby,
went to pieces.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.357
They marched out single-file,
hands in the air.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.926
That was 40 something years ago.
Went like that.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.320
You're gonna have a hard time
getting my generation
off the stage.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.191
Willie Nelson's
still doing concerts.

13:21.322 --> 13:25.195
Yeah, I mean, to be fair,
Dad, Willie Nelson
is a guitar player...

13:25.326 --> 13:28.503
and he's not doing
a lot of heavy police work.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.637
This is scary. It's new.
I never saw a body like that.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.727
It's a murder. It's nothing new.
Treat it like a murder.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.686
You get the team together,
all right?

13:37.817 --> 13:41.081
You get all the guys together.
You handle them,
I'll handle everything else.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.692
Oh, my God.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.174
What is this? 11 new emails
on this thing this morning.

13:47.304 --> 13:50.090
Jesus Christ,
this is worse than my birthday.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.578
<i>So he was being confrontational?</i>

14:00.709 --> 14:02.667
Yeah, I mean they were renters.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.582
We thought they were in town
for Mall Park and all
with the slopes opening...

14:04.713 --> 14:06.715
but they just wanted
to be rude to people.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.891
All right, but he was
being confrontational?

14:09.022 --> 14:12.112
Yeah, I mean, he got
all pissed off 'cause
I called my buddy an asshole.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.810
And then, you know,
he's trying to act all tough.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.987
I mean, honestly,
I'm not surprised with this
happening here, you know...

14:18.118 --> 14:19.859
'cause it's been stirring up
for a while now.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.251
What did you say back to him?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.775
I didn't say shit. I said,
"Have a nice evening."

14:23.906 --> 14:26.474
I mean, we had
some drinking to do.
We went on to Porter's...

14:27.605 --> 14:29.172
and then we walked home.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.044
Yeah, and he's
got receipts, too.
Show her your receipts.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.481
-Yeah, I take pictures of 'em.
-You got receipts?

14:34.699 --> 14:35.875
Don't swipe left.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.267
Yeah.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.879
I'm sorry. Hold up.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.272
Am I a suspect here?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.970
Because if you want
to show me a warrant...

14:44.100 --> 14:45.710
then I'll show you
everything in my phone
all you want...

14:45.841 --> 14:47.625
but otherwise we got work to do.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.540
Are we good?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.673
I didn't kill that girl.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.025
Have a nice day.

14:59.507 --> 15:00.508
Bitch.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.194
<i>Our guys come out the woods,
grab her by the tub.</i>

15:34.324 --> 15:38.241
Move her from the deck
to the lawn. And by that time,
she couldn't scream.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.069
Okay.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.071
Which is consistent
with the blood spatter
on the siding there.

15:42.202 --> 15:46.380
Now, they remove her... parts...

15:46.510 --> 15:49.774
bag 'em and exit on foot
'cause there's no tire prints.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.472
Unless they parked on the hill.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.821
The footprints are canine.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.779
No, it's not an animal.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.607
You'd need a knife
or specialized claws,
you'd need thumbs for that...

15:56.738 --> 15:58.522
and you don't have
a getaway driver
if you're a serial killer.

15:58.653 --> 15:59.784
D.C. Sniper.

15:59.915 --> 16:00.916
Yeah, that was different.

16:01.047 --> 16:01.961
Still serial.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.963
Yeah, that was different.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.400
So the victim turns off
the hot water valve,
thinking it's for the hot tub.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.011
Then she's attacked.
They remove her vagina.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.231
The killer
must have been waiting
along this fence.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.928
He must've been watching.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.453
My heart goes out
to the boyfriend.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.151
It's like the ultimate
blue balls story, fellas.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.980
It was a full moon last night.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.329
How are we doing here, fellas?

16:22.459 --> 16:23.460
Tonight, too.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.722
Just the check, Laura.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.594
You guys are gonna find
this monster, right?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.336
That's right. Ain't got nothing
to worry about. We'll find him.

16:29.466 --> 16:33.775
You just tell your boss
to keep focusing on making her
interesting dessert recipes.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.907
I can hear you out there, Ray.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.997
Asshole talking
about my cooking.

16:39.650 --> 16:40.956
Why the hell
did you let me get married?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.306
I told you not to.
We all told you.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.352
Can't be married
and focus on your career.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.484
Tell me about the neighbors
and the fight at the restaurant.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.051
Yeah, Julia said
the fight was innocent.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.010
Most of the neighbors
are out for the winter.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.056
Homeowner story checks out.
Letting us take over
the property.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.059
They own that place
on Maple with all that
Japanese bullshit on the lawn.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.887
What is that shit?
You know what I'm talking about?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.497
It's a rock garden.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.935
You never seen
a rock garden before?

17:04.066 --> 17:06.460
No, my ears are still ringing
from his wife
fucking chewing me out.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.505
Tell me about the victim.
She used to live out here?

17:08.636 --> 17:11.465
Yeah, went to the elementary.
I'm meeting with
the administration tomorrow.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.554
Okay. Start making calls.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.731
Anybody that's seen anything
suspicious. Like at
the post office, Porter's...

17:16.861 --> 17:18.776
knife sharpeners, anything.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.997
My money is on this guy
hunts elk. Something he can
field dress in no time.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.739
Don't bother Sheriff about this.
We got ski season
to think about.

17:24.869 --> 17:28.873
Everything goes through me,
then Sheriff, then town hall.
Got it?

17:29.004 --> 17:31.659
No, we don't got anything.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.965
Let state handle it.
The feds handle it.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.750
All right? It's an animal.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.273
I got drunk drivers
to deal with.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.753
Are you serious?

17:38.883 --> 17:41.408
This is what everybody's talking
about right now.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.149
You want people
to stop talking shit
about the police?

17:43.279 --> 17:44.846
Do better police work.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.066
We don't do this shit,
all right?
Somebody's gonna handle it.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.329
Don't say "somebody."
That somebody is us.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.070
When you say "somebody"
that means "nobody."

17:51.200 --> 17:52.767
Look, it's a one-off.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.769
It's an ex-boyfriend
trying to make it look like
a serial.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.205
Maybe it is a wolf.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.251
A wolf doesn't cut
a fucking internal organ out.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.166
But why would he take
the parts out of her?

18:00.296 --> 18:01.428
Make it look like a serial.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.126
Why did he take the parts
off of her?

18:04.866 --> 18:07.521
To eat 'em. I don't know.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.132
Make a Fleshlight out of 'em.
I don't know.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.919
This whole thing's gonna be done
in a week.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.270
They're gonna incriminate
somebody through their texts...

18:17.400 --> 18:18.880
or their Facebook messages.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.186
It's the 21st century.

18:21.752 --> 18:25.278
Don't start
with this shit, John.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.454
All right?
Let the FBI find him.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.282
Right?

18:29.673 --> 18:30.674
Right.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.521
All right.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.220
So just little side to side
like this, you know,
get loose with it.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.961
And get used
to putting your weight
on your front foot too, right?

18:57.092 --> 18:58.354
And just look
where you wanna go.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.182
And just remember,
dudes, it's snow.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.010
Worst that'll happen
is you'll fall on your butt.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.838
Yeah, and it hurts.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.927
What's your name? Jordan?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.103
Jordan, I used to suck.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.323
In fact, at one point,
I sucked worse than you do.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.672
And that's difficult.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.501
All right, y'all ready?

19:14.631 --> 19:15.589
Let's do this.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.712
-Good night, Andrea.
-Night.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.322
You going to
the Over All-Nighter?

19:54.062 --> 19:55.106
No.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.458
I'm not.
I'm doing something else.

20:00.242 --> 20:04.333
Josh has this cooker,
and I told him I would go by.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.335
I thought we did this.
I thought we were done with him.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.424
I mean, me too, I get it.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.165
I don't know
what you want me to say.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.341
That you're not gonna
hang out with guys
who treat you badly.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.430
That'd be nice.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.172
Yeah, how about next time
I let you choose the one boy
in town who likes me?

21:16.449 --> 21:17.406
No!

21:19.190 --> 21:20.801
Do not text me to tell me...

21:20.931 --> 21:23.238
that you might not be able
to make it
to her orientation.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.458
They say if you
don't catch the guy
within the first 48 hours...

21:25.588 --> 21:27.111
you're never gonna catch him.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.723
Okay, well,
she's gonna be a lot safer
living with me...

21:29.853 --> 21:32.160
than she will be
with you in Upperville,
and that's for sure.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.422
-Hi, sweetie, how are you?
-Can I get you something?

21:33.553 --> 21:35.076
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah, coffee.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.686
She's gonna need help
with her move.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.949
So, are you gonna be
supportive or not?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.604
Hi, Brittany.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.780
Jenna, like I said
in that voicemail...

21:43.911 --> 21:46.261
there's gonna be a lot
of late nights and overtime
because of the brutal murder...

21:46.392 --> 21:47.915
that happened in town.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.569
And I gotta catch the guy...

21:49.699 --> 21:51.832
and I didn't wanna
set up expectations
that I can't keep.

21:51.962 --> 21:54.922
Oh, no. Our expectations
of you are very low.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.229
She is 17 and starting college
with a gymnastics scholarship.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.319
It is a big deal.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.495
-I need to make sure
you're gonna be there.
-Yes.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.845
Brittany
, I'm gonna be there, okay?

22:04.975 --> 22:07.282
How much coffee
have you had today?
Can we not do this at Bonanza's?

22:07.413 --> 22:09.850
Jesus Christ,
I'd have a nicer time
at Abu Ghraib.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.068
Thank you so much.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.331
Help me!

22:33.743 --> 22:34.570
John.

22:36.093 --> 22:36.920
What?

22:49.890 --> 22:52.196
Shut down the mountain.
Get these fucking cars
out of here.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.155
Call your people.
We need this parking lot.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.287
-John.
-It's another young woman.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.551
John, they're saying
it's a big bear,
big jaw or something.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.553
No, it's a man.
When do I get to be right
about something?

23:00.683 --> 23:02.337
With canine's lower mandible.
That's what they're saying.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.991
Get 'em on the phone.
I'm not listening to that.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.558
I got 'em on the phone.
I'm telling you
what they're saying.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.516
Hey! You can't park that here.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.084
You can't park that here.
We need you 500 feet
away at least.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.086
It's a crime scene.
Just park on Elm Street.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.957
-It's just the press, boss.
-They got Monica Bravo out here.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.176
Who the fuck called the news?

23:15.306 --> 23:16.395
-Hey, John?
-John.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.527
Not everybody talk
to me at once, okay?

23:18.658 --> 23:19.702
Yes, sorry, Brittany.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.487
I'm going to be there
January 28th.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.358
Do not fucking
call me again, okay?
Do not call me. I'm at work.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.186
<i>I just wanted to know
if you're gonna be there.</i>

23:25.316 --> 23:27.493
-Who's the victim? Is she local?
-Looks like it.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.059
We gotta get a van
to pull her out of here.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.974
All right. Hey, do we have
anybody of our guys in a van?

23:31.105 --> 23:32.672
John, we're gonna
need fingerprints.
Her top is gone.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.151
Her what?

23:34.282 --> 23:37.067
Her head. Her head is gone.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.069
Got it.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.636
John. John?

23:40.767 --> 23:41.942
Yeah.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.509
Got bites on the neck
and on her arms, too.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.119
I can't hear you!
You gotta fucking speak up!

23:45.249 --> 23:47.164
They're saying it's a wolf!

23:56.696 --> 23:59.089
Bo, come take a walk with me.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.482
Get State Forensics out here.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.266
I don't wanna talk to them
on the phone ever again.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.877
Get them on
the fucking crime scene.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.357
Yeah, Bo, come take a walk.
Let's have a little chat.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.447
Lord and God,
you're the source of life.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.101
Keep us in life and death
and your love.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.975
Now let us listen to the words
of the Lord
in the holy scripture...

24:15.105 --> 24:19.893
that gives us reassurance
of the Lord's love
for us in life and death.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.552
What'd you wanna talk about?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.079
No! No!

24:32.209 --> 24:34.211
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
-John, stop it!

24:35.822 --> 24:37.345
Where were you?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.826
Yeah, fuck you.
Where were the cops?

24:39.956 --> 24:42.002
Sitting there
in your little suit.

24:42.132 --> 24:45.048
When are you gonna
get this fucking thing?

24:45.179 --> 24:47.050
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be!

24:47.181 --> 24:49.966
Find it! Find it!

24:50.097 --> 24:51.925
<i>John. John. John!</i>

24:52.055 --> 24:53.274
Can I get a signature?

24:53.927 --> 24:54.928
Yeah.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.277
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

24:56.407 --> 24:57.844
All right. I'm closing her up.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.889
Mayor wants a word.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.325
State Attorney's office called.
Wanted info 'cause
the election's coming up.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.979
I can't do that shit right now.
You wrap out.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.503
I can't wrap this out.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.374
Yeah, I got fucking
Sheriff calling me.
Jenna's...

25:06.505 --> 25:09.725
Look, just wrap up
the crime scene,
I'll handle the town.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.336
This is a relationship.
Does that sound good to you?

25:13.729 --> 25:14.774
Yes.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.558
Good. Wrap out.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.779
Another young woman, right?

25:19.909 --> 25:21.607
Brilliant fucking
detective work, Chavez.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.130
Well, it was a full moon
again last night.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.089
Cut it out with that
goddamn Roswell shit, Chavez!

25:26.220 --> 25:27.351
Wrap out!

25:29.049 --> 25:31.486
<i>The streets should have been
bustling with tourists.</i>

25:31.617 --> 25:33.532
<i>But not today.</i>

25:33.662 --> 25:36.230
<i>And not since
the violent murders of two <i>
young women left a stain...</i></i>

25:36.360 --> 25:39.625
<i>on a small mountain town
and its law enforcement.</i>

25:39.755 --> 25:42.279
<i>What will it take
for Snow Hollow, Utah...</i>

25:42.410 --> 25:46.719
<i>to regain the reputation
of the fun-loving ski capital <i>
of the town?</i></i>

25:53.639 --> 25:55.728
<i>Sir, if you had
one message to <i>the local police department...</i></i>

25:55.858 --> 25:57.773
<i>
what would you have to say?</i>

25:57.904 --> 25:59.427
<i>I'd say to the local
police department, you <i>gotta find this guy or girl...</i></i>

25:59.558 --> 26:01.168
<i>I don't know,
I don't know what it is.</i>

26:01.298 --> 26:02.865
<i>But you gotta find this guy,
you take him out.</i>

26:02.996 --> 26:05.085
<i>'Cause I'm not paying
any more taxes in this town.</i>

26:08.175 --> 26:09.480
Oh, jeez.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.179
Excuse me, would you mind
taking that down?

26:12.309 --> 26:13.484
I'd rather
not have people see that.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.791
I don't choose what goes up.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.359
All right, just take down
the first part, please.

26:18.489 --> 26:21.144
Darren decides what goes up.
I just fill it out.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.756
Darren decides that?

26:24.278 --> 26:25.279
Darn.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.629
Hey, is this your car?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.065
I like those.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.591
Expired plates though.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.075
-I don't think
Darren would mind.
-No, I don't think he will.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.947
Thank you so much.
You have a good day.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.601
Hi, Carla.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.218
For me?

26:51.348 --> 26:52.654
It's a gift from Bo.

26:55.788 --> 26:56.745
Wow.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.487
This is really great.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.707
This is really special.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.578
But I already
filed the paperwork...

27:03.709 --> 27:04.884
so I need you
to get out of the building
in the next 20 minutes...

27:05.014 --> 27:06.407
'cause you're not gonna
be working here anymore.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.327
Maybe look into getting
a job at WikiLeaks.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.155
I hear they might
be hiring soon.

27:19.899 --> 27:20.987
Sorry about that...

27:30.474 --> 27:31.562
Sorry about that.

27:31.693 --> 27:32.781
What do you got for us, John?

27:33.129 --> 27:34.304
Hangover.

27:35.610 --> 27:36.785
What did you say?

27:36.916 --> 27:39.005
I said anger issues.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.833
I think you said something else.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.966
No. No, I didn't.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.621
That's cute.

27:46.752 --> 27:50.886
I think we ought to bring in
someone with expertise
on exotic animals.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.541
No. No, we're not gonna do that.
'Cause that's insane.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.760
All right,
then you figure it out.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.500
It's a wolf.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.328
Or maybe it's a werewolf.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.069
I've been watching
a lot of History Channel
lately...

28:00.200 --> 28:01.854
No. Chavez, it's...

28:01.984 --> 28:03.986
Sorry. Everybody...

28:04.117 --> 28:07.163
let me just make this
perfectly clear.

28:07.294 --> 28:10.123
There is no such thing
as werewolves.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.820
They're imaginary.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.604
Our killer is a guy.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.433
And I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna kill...

28:16.564 --> 28:18.348
-Wow.
-And we're gonna bring him
to justice...

28:18.479 --> 28:20.263
legally and together.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.917
She has pawprints and hair.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.311
Yeah, sorry, Chavez.
Please enlighten us.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.227
Did you take forensic psychology
at your college online?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.576
-Fuck you, asshole.
-Out.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.665
-Fuck you. Yeah.
-What? Dumbass. Keep walking.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.058
-Yeah, all right, tough guy.
-You wanna go?

28:32.188 --> 28:33.320
Yeah, like you're always...

28:33.450 --> 28:34.625
-John!
-All right.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.758
John McEnroe.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.499
Team is with you.

28:38.629 --> 28:41.763
They got no dog in this fight.
You want leadership? Lead.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.331
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.387
Julia.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.434
Medical examiner's
report please.

29:00.564 --> 29:03.176
Officer Robson. Thank you, John.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.179
Animal hair is part pit bull
but that's 'cause Hannah
was a dog owner.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.224
Rest of the hair
is all grey wolf.

29:08.355 --> 29:09.486
Lab is still working on it.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.184
But it's possible that
a pack of wolves...

29:11.314 --> 29:13.273
visited our crime scene
between her murder
and our arrival...

29:13.403 --> 29:15.014
but that seems unlikely.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.929
Teeth are consistent
with a wolf...

29:17.059 --> 29:19.409
so if anybody sees
that Michael J. Fox guy
walking around, let me know.

29:22.282 --> 29:25.764
Yeah, everybody laughs
till she lays out
the crime scene photos.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.639
Genitals were intact
in the second victim.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.296
Everything was intact,
generally speaking, except
for her head, which was taken.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.037
Canine bites on her arms
and back.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.431
She fought like hell.

29:41.562 --> 29:44.173
Took a lot of hair off him.

29:44.304 --> 29:47.960
Spans of the bites
are gigantic. Same as
the distance of the paw prints.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.963
State Forensics say
it's the size
of a Kodiak bear...

29:51.093 --> 29:53.574
or something
that could hold her down
with its mouth.

29:53.704 --> 29:56.751
No saliva, no DNA,
apart from the hair.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.448
All the blood was hers.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.235
Our killer doesn't leave
much behind.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.760
Of his own, that is.

30:11.548 --> 30:12.593
Hey, honey.

30:12.723 --> 30:13.637
Hey, Dad.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.162
Is this that biology thing?

30:16.292 --> 30:17.206
Calculus.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.382
All right.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.297
Did you need any help
with that? Or...

30:21.428 --> 30:22.429
Nope.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.129
Can I talk to you
about something real quick?

30:28.000 --> 30:28.957
Sure.

30:31.307 --> 30:34.049
I'm having a hard time
with this thing, honey.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.052
It's nothing you have
to worry about. I'm gonna
find the guy, obviously.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.620
But I'm just curious
if you still have
that pepper spray...

30:39.750 --> 30:41.491
that I got you for communion.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.538
I think so.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.845
You realize that
was a weird gift
to give somebody, right?

30:46.975 --> 30:48.803
I do. It's okay.
You'll never need it.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.805
But I want you to promise me
that you're gonna find it...

30:50.936 --> 30:52.154
and keep it on you at all times.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.243
What's wrong?

30:54.374 --> 30:56.158
Nothing.

30:56.289 --> 30:59.553
Dad, you know how many people
die in Utah
from tobacco every year?

30:59.683 --> 31:02.382
Yeah, I saw your post
about that and that's
really interesting, honey...

31:02.512 --> 31:04.340
but those
people didn't die like this.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.081
And I just get nervous
with the way that you dress.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.909
How do I dress?

31:08.040 --> 31:09.606
Perfectly reasonably.

31:09.737 --> 31:13.349
I've just seen the way
that people look at you,
women included.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.395
I think you'll understand
when you have children
of your own.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.353
I don't want children.

31:19.268 --> 31:22.141
Dad, you're not
the only person in charge
of protecting the town.

31:22.271 --> 31:25.448
You're not Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
and you're not Grandpa, okay?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.189
Why are you acting like this?

31:27.320 --> 31:30.192
Well, Dad never
got any gymnastics medals
growing up, honey...

31:30.323 --> 31:34.196
so I guess I'm just trying
to catch up to you.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.242
Do you think maybe this could be
about your mom leaving you...

31:36.372 --> 31:37.547
when you were a kid?

31:40.072 --> 31:41.464
No.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.552
And maybe you're thinking
that if you catch the guy...

31:42.683 --> 31:44.554
you'll be able
to prove her wrong.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.513
No.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.210
No, I don't think that, frankly.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.690
I thought we were doing
your math homework.
Will you just...

31:49.820 --> 31:51.213
I'm trying to have
a normal conversation
with you.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.216
All right.

31:54.782 --> 31:55.826
So...

31:58.699 --> 32:00.005
I'm taking off.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.098
So the state police are unhappy.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.143
Forensically speaking,
there's not a whole lot
of evidence for 'em...

32:08.274 --> 32:10.232
and they got city cases
to solve.

32:10.363 --> 32:13.192
I called Quantico
but it takes two months for
the application to go through.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.889
We only have two victims...

32:15.020 --> 32:16.151
and if the murders
didn't take place
on a federal highway...

32:16.282 --> 32:18.023
the FBI can't even come in.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.589
Did you know that?

32:19.720 --> 32:21.809
And I hate to say
we'll catch him,
but we'll catch him.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.203
He'll slip up.
Most times it's them.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.856
Every time it's them.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.860
You think it's a guy, right?
You don't...

32:29.991 --> 32:31.036
You don't think
it's like an animal...

32:31.166 --> 32:32.211
-or something?
-No.

32:32.341 --> 32:33.560
Yeah, it's a guy.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.128
I mean, it's wolf prints
but do you have to ask?

32:36.258 --> 32:39.522
I don't know.
Chavez seems to think
it's something else.

32:39.653 --> 32:42.961
Yeah, well,
Chavez thinks <i>Men in Black
is a documentary.</i>

32:47.356 --> 32:49.315
Maybe you're right.
Let's do a stakeout.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.447
I hear serial killers
sometimes return
to the crime scene.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.717
What was that?

33:01.501 --> 33:02.893
Beer bottle.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.112
Beer bottle?

33:05.940 --> 33:08.987
Who would wanna throw
a beer bottle
at a cop car?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.603
She's harmless. Come in.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.258
<i>...on a small mountain town
and its law enforcement.</i>

34:03.389 --> 34:05.826
<i>What will it take
for Snow Hollow, Utah...</i>

34:05.956 --> 34:07.480
<i>to regain the reputation
of the fun-loving...</i>

34:07.610 --> 34:08.785
Skipping town?

34:08.916 --> 34:11.788
Yeah. Well, no.
Just Orange County.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.660
Gotta keep moving, you know.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.662
For Mom.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.099
You stop moving,
you start thinking.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.189
They got a clinic out there
for stuff like me.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.888
I didn't kill Brianne,
if that's what you're wondering.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.716
Yeah, we know that.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.154
State police didn't,
so Mom said I should
just make that clear.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.851
That's state.

34:30.981 --> 34:33.549
Yeah. Cool.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.377
So why are you bothering me?

34:36.291 --> 34:37.553
You came all the way down here.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.208
That must mean
you still haven't found
anything.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.124
You must really not have a clue.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.431
Am I right?

34:46.736 --> 34:48.303
I thought you would have
found this guy by now.

34:48.434 --> 34:50.436
See, this is
why people talk shit
about the police.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.525
Sorry, but...

34:52.655 --> 34:54.527
We were wondering if maybe
you remember anything suspicious
about that night...

34:54.657 --> 34:56.485
that might've come to you
since we last spoke...

34:56.616 --> 34:58.966
or something from
your relationship
with Brianne that might've...

34:59.097 --> 35:00.054
No.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.056
Dropped the bags. Restaurant.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.318
Went back to the house.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.582
And, no, I didn't see
a goddamn werewolf.

35:06.713 --> 35:07.888
This takes cooperation.

35:08.018 --> 35:08.889
I'm cooperating.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.717
This could've been a phone call.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.849
How many people on
your team and you still
haven't found this guy?

35:12.980 --> 35:15.330
-Did you see anybody tall?
-I saw nothing!

35:15.461 --> 35:16.810
Nothing!

35:16.940 --> 35:20.509
I've done this 25 times
and it sucks every fucking time.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.728
Something...

35:22.903 --> 35:24.861
Just leave me alone.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.515
She was a beauty queen.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.431
Brianne.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.396
We came to give you back
the possessions we took.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.137
No, I don't want that shit.
Get that shit away from me.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.442
-Mom, I don't want that shit.
-PJ.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.357
We'll take that.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.272
No, they could've called me
and they could've asked me
if I wanted it.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.360
I don't...

35:48.058 --> 35:48.885
Mom.

35:49.886 --> 35:50.887
I'm just gonna...

35:51.714 --> 35:53.716
I'm gonna leave my card...

35:53.847 --> 35:54.848
right here.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.120
Hey, Officer?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.602
If you do find him...

36:10.690 --> 36:11.995
don't arrest him.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.738
Shoot him.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.045
Shoot him till you can see
the ground
through his face.

36:32.625 --> 36:33.930
What are you doing?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.149
You playing with sugar?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.368
You're so silly.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.674
Here. I'll make it
easier for you.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.862
You mind if I sit here?

36:52.993 --> 36:54.255
Yeah, that's fine. Go for it.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.173
How old is she?

37:00.392 --> 37:01.697
She's three.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.046
She's beautiful.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.831
Thank you.
You're so pretty.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.311
Y'all live around here?

37:06.441 --> 37:07.921
Yeah. Just up Fox Farm.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.705
Fox Farm.
It's a good neighborhood.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.707
Yeah, I mean, we like it.
We grew up there...

37:11.838 --> 37:13.448
and went to
the elementary school
and everything so...

37:13.579 --> 37:15.798
That's great.
I used to work with them.

37:15.929 --> 37:16.930
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.584
Would've been years ago.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.281
-Liz?
-Yeah, over here. Thank you.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.588
They used to have me
give presentations there.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.242
That's great.

37:24.372 --> 37:26.069
And you're gonna send her
to the elementary, too?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.897
My husband and I will, yeah.

37:28.507 --> 37:29.812
Thank you so much.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.599
That blue car is nice, huh?

37:35.209 --> 37:37.124
I've been seeing
the ads for 'em.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.258
Yeah, we like it.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.347
It's a big back seat.
Baby on board now, so...

37:44.610 --> 37:46.525
Is your hair always that color?

37:46.655 --> 37:48.962
It is. I'm sorry.
They put onions on here.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.833
Will you excuse me?
I just have to take care of it.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.531
Yeah, okay.
It's nice meeting you.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.054
Yeah, you as well.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.360
Okay, come on, sweetie,
let's go.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.321
Excuse me,
can I borrow your telephone
for a moment, please?

38:00.452 --> 38:02.715
I think
I'd like to call the police.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.674
<i>Sorry to make you retell it, <i>but just so everyone can hear...</i></i>

38:05.805 --> 38:07.894
<i>would you mind recounting it
for everybody?</i>

38:08.024 --> 38:09.156
It was definitely him.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.332
He was weird
and I could tell it was him.

38:11.463 --> 38:14.944
And I've never met anybody
like that
around here really...

38:15.075 --> 38:17.295
and I know he was local
because he said "y'all."

38:17.425 --> 38:18.687
And he was really big.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.863
-How tall?
-I don't know. But he was big.

38:20.994 --> 38:23.170
And he kind of smelled like
a dark room.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.476
Like the kind they use
for photography.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.439
I don't even know why
you brought me in here.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.746
Randall. He works in the back.
He works in the meat department.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.530
I don't know where
he gets all that meat.

38:35.661 --> 38:36.879
You should talk to him.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.490
Do not call me a sex worker.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.926
You know how offensive that is?

38:40.056 --> 38:41.319
I don't even
do that shit anymore.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.668
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.147
I own a lot of properties, okay?

38:44.278 --> 38:45.845
You're not gonna pin
this thing on me,
all right?

38:45.975 --> 38:47.803
I already talked
to half the goddamn staff here.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.240
Now can someone let me
call my fucking wife?
Please?

38:50.371 --> 38:53.156
You've gotta get your shit
together. I could've fucking
solved this thing by now.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.071
I was out of my house.

38:55.202 --> 38:58.074
I heard this noise
and I saw this shape.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.511
It was big.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.644
It was a big woman.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.429
He wanted to know about Miley
and how old she was.

39:04.559 --> 39:07.257
And he knew what car I'd driven.
He knew that I'd driven there.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.476
He had had blood here...

39:08.607 --> 39:10.435
-She was big.
-...and on a newspaper...

39:10.565 --> 39:11.958
-Cool if I smoke in here?
-I'm like, "Dude,
we don't sell goat's milk.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.220
"We sell cow's milk."
He's like...

39:13.351 --> 39:14.482
"I want goat's milk.
I want goat's milk now."

39:14.613 --> 39:15.962
The newspaper
that he had was weird, too.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.833
I got cats at home.
I got things to do.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.183
It had advertisements
from the '50s.
Like cigarette advertisements.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.142
You know the drill.
I know the drill.
Stop. I'm done.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.623
I haven't done anything.
Please just get me the lawyer.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.233
Sixth Amendment.
I want a phone call.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.191
<i>Did you notice
if he took anything <i>
from your table?</i></i>

39:28.322 --> 39:30.672
Like a receipt? I'm talking
even something small.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.674
No.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.676
Late 20s to...

39:36.504 --> 39:39.072
I don't know. Maybe early 50s.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.769
Maybe. I don't know. I mean...

39:42.467 --> 39:43.772
he had his hood up.

39:45.426 --> 39:46.819
And it was hot in there.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.651
Well, thank you for
bringing this to our
attention, Mrs. Fairchild.

39:52.781 --> 39:55.393
We'll have our offices call you
if we need anything else.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.135
Wait. Do you think
it could've been him?

40:00.136 --> 40:01.399
Maybe.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.617
Thanks for coming in.

40:04.227 --> 40:05.403
I got something.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.799
I know who
the Snow Hollow wolfman is.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.847
Great.
We wanna hear all about it.

40:19.329 --> 40:21.767
Hey, Dave. How are we looking?

40:21.897 --> 40:24.857
Clean bill of health.
Said I should check back
next summer.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.382
It's a heart murmur.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.297
Goddamn it!

40:30.428 --> 40:31.559
-Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.
-There's a great facility
at General.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.300
Dave. Out.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.823
All right, look,
he said I was fine
just before you got in here.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.390
Guy's not even a real doctor.

40:41.221 --> 40:42.614
What are you doing?

40:42.744 --> 40:44.703
I'm fine.
I don't know what
he's talking about.

40:44.833 --> 40:45.747
No, you're not. Just work
from home. Nobody gives a shit
if you work from home.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.009
The only person
that cares is you.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.837
-Really?
-Yeah. I got this.

40:48.968 --> 40:50.491
No, you don't.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.406
You can't steamroll me
out of here
with all this going on.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.191
That is ageism,
no siree. Ageism.

40:55.322 --> 40:57.977
I wanna know
about those interviews.

40:58.107 --> 41:01.459
Yeah, I mean, they're
actually going pretty great.

41:01.589 --> 41:04.810
Couple of local call girls,
some survivors' testimonies...

41:04.940 --> 41:06.202
No! Hey! I'm not doing this!

41:06.333 --> 41:07.769
Stand up! Goddamn it!
You have any idea...

41:07.900 --> 41:09.423
what you're putting me through
with this goddamn stress?

41:09.554 --> 41:11.643
I wake up
in the middle of the night,
the phone's ringing!

41:11.773 --> 41:13.862
The first thing that I think
is somebody's calling me...

41:13.993 --> 41:15.037
to tell me that you're dead!

41:15.168 --> 41:17.257
Oh, you're the victim.
I got it now.

41:17.387 --> 41:19.041
-It's a fucking nightmare!
-All about you.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.652
Goddamn it! Just go to a doctor!

41:20.782 --> 41:23.698
I'm not doing this shit anymore!
I'm not a child!

41:23.829 --> 41:26.179
You don't trust
that I know myself.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.921
No, I trust you.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.793
Trust you being
a complete fucking asshole
about this.

41:31.924 --> 41:34.361
All right, I'm an asshole.
I'm gonna work on that.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.190
We done with that?
All right? Finished?

41:39.627 --> 41:43.588
Now, tell me
about those interviews.

43:07.019 --> 43:08.020
All right.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.456
Hey. We're looking
for somebody big.

43:10.675 --> 43:12.502
No!

43:12.633 --> 43:14.156
<i>I want license plates
ut of everybody <i>
that came out of that cafe.</i></i>

43:14.287 --> 43:16.724
Do you have anything?
Fingerprints?
Blood? Fucking anything?

43:16.855 --> 43:18.987
<i>There's a lot of blood.</i>

43:19.118 --> 43:21.642
It's just me and Kevin
down here. I've never
worked with a body like this...

43:21.773 --> 43:24.689
Don't email us saying
you got nothing. What the fuck
is County paying you for?

43:24.819 --> 43:25.777
That's not my job!

43:25.907 --> 43:26.995
No!

43:27.126 --> 43:28.606
-That is your job.
-I'm a medical examiner.

43:28.736 --> 43:31.565
-That is your job.
That is your job.
-I analyze data.

43:31.696 --> 43:35.047
Your job
is to find the suspects.

43:37.005 --> 43:39.529
God, we thank thee for the life
that you give us.

43:39.660 --> 43:43.621
It is full of work,
responsibility and joy.

43:44.491 --> 43:45.840
Get off of me!

43:52.412 --> 43:57.156
Today, we thank thee
for the lives
of Miley and Liz.

43:57.286 --> 43:59.854
Help us in our mourning
and teach us to live
for the living...

43:59.985 --> 44:02.378
So our guy kills a deer,
he drags it out here...

44:02.509 --> 44:03.945
lays it in the middle
of the road.

44:04.076 --> 44:05.555
He has a handprint on it,
so he cuts a patch off of it...

44:05.686 --> 44:06.774
to get rid of the handprint...

44:06.905 --> 44:08.297
Wait, how do you know
it's a handprint?

44:08.428 --> 44:10.430
There's a patch missing
from the deer.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.737
He must have put a handprint
down and then cut it off
so that we couldn't find it.

44:12.867 --> 44:14.129
What if it's a hunter
without a license?

44:14.260 --> 44:15.696
A hunter without a license?

44:15.827 --> 44:17.872
Come fucking tell me
it's a hunter without a license.

44:18.003 --> 44:19.352
-Come over here and tell me...
-It's a perfectly...

44:19.482 --> 44:21.136
No! No! I wanna hear
your theory.

44:21.267 --> 44:23.138
Tell me right here
that it's a hunter
without a license.

44:23.269 --> 44:24.662
I wanna hear this.
This is gonna be great.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.055
It's a hunter without a license.

44:27.186 --> 44:29.057
You're a bad police officer.

44:29.188 --> 44:31.059
You should've pursued
computer science because
you are not good at this.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.111
I'm a father.

44:39.241 --> 44:40.939
No, you're not.

44:58.217 --> 45:00.523
<i>Is there any way you can make
just my room warmer?</i>

45:00.654 --> 45:03.178
There's a way
to make just you warmer.
Put on a sweater.

46:36.532 --> 46:38.534
<i>So what is a werewolf?</i>

46:38.665 --> 46:40.667
<i>Story comes from the Middle
Ages.</i>

46:40.798 --> 46:43.278
<i>These townspeople would find
a woman's body in the <i>
woods, just decimated...</i></i>

46:43.409 --> 46:46.629
<i>and they say, "It couldn't
have been a man. Had to <i>
be a monster."</i></i>

46:46.760 --> 46:48.588
It's actually just men.

46:48.718 --> 46:51.069
These guys who get angry every
once in a while and take it out
on women.

46:51.199 --> 46:52.331
Because they hate them.

46:52.461 --> 46:53.854
There's no magic, there's no
transformation.

46:53.985 --> 46:55.769
In fact, the only reason it
happens on a full moon...

46:55.900 --> 46:58.816
is because it was bright enough
to be able to sneak up and kill
somebody.

46:58.946 --> 47:00.861
Hi, I'm calling
from the Sheriff's department.

47:00.992 --> 47:02.558
I'm wondering if you guys keep
records of anybody...

47:02.689 --> 47:05.300
<i>that might've worked for the
school from about <i>
1970...</i></i>

47:05.431 --> 47:07.128
<i>until early 2000s, let's say.</i>

47:09.565 --> 47:11.698
No, this has nothing to do
with the murder investigation.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.005
<i>This is actually a new
investigation of a serial <i>
arsonist...</i></i>

47:14.135 --> 47:16.355
who's been setting fire to local
nosy people's automobiles,
actually.

47:16.485 --> 47:18.270
So are you gonna give us those
yearbooks, or what's going on?

47:20.359 --> 47:23.188
Victims are always women
and the killers are always men.

47:23.318 --> 47:24.842
Why is it always women?

47:26.887 --> 47:29.759
You think women have had to deal
with shit like this since the
Middle Ages?

47:34.286 --> 47:35.722
So he didn't tie her up.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.637
<i>He didn't lure her into his car <i>or something like that.</i></i>

47:37.767 --> 47:40.770
<i>It's a hunt. It's a thrill
for him. She's a <i>
trophy.</i></i>

47:40.901 --> 47:42.816
<i>And he parked his car
in the back of the cafe...</i>

47:42.947 --> 47:44.209
<i>so the security cameras at
the bank don't catch him <i>
in the parking lot.</i></i>

47:44.339 --> 47:46.254
<i>-He must be local.
-Could be no.</i>

47:46.385 --> 47:49.083
If he were local, why didn't he
use the front gate at the first
crime scene?

47:49.214 --> 47:50.650
<i>Why'd he hop the fence?</i>

47:50.780 --> 47:53.218
<i>And those tape decks at the bank <i>only go back 10 hours.</i></i>

47:53.348 --> 47:54.175
<i>Have we checked them?</i>

47:54.306 --> 47:55.481
I checked them.

47:55.611 --> 47:57.309
How does nobody else see this
guy?

47:57.439 --> 47:59.789
<i>"Lycanthropy is affected
by the moon's light...</i>

47:59.920 --> 48:01.400
<i>"and depending on the moon's
breadth..."</i>

48:32.126 --> 48:33.084
<i>John?</i>

48:34.389 --> 48:35.216
John!

48:37.610 --> 48:38.741
Oh, fuck you!

48:38.872 --> 48:41.657
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were sleeping.

48:41.788 --> 48:44.573
Well, I'm wide awake now!
What can I do for you?

48:44.704 --> 48:47.359
Well, somebody's been calling
you on your walkie-talkie.

48:47.489 --> 48:48.969
I don't know what to do.

48:50.710 --> 48:51.972
All right.

48:52.799 --> 48:53.887
Thank you so much.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.019
Yeah.

48:55.149 --> 48:56.759
And, hey, Ray, quick librarian
note.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.761
Yeah, yeah.

48:58.892 --> 49:00.241
A police officer asks you to
take out all the spooky books in
a library...

49:00.372 --> 49:01.373
maybe don't sneak up on him.

49:01.503 --> 49:02.635
I'm sorry, John.

49:02.765 --> 49:04.115
No, it's fine. Thank you for
doing that.

49:04.245 --> 49:05.943
But had that been another member
of my team...

49:06.073 --> 49:08.119
what you just pulled right
there, that could've ended in a
shooting.

49:08.249 --> 49:09.511
Oh, wow, really?

49:09.642 --> 49:11.470
Yeah, and that would've been
lights out for Ray.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.081
So, just...

49:14.603 --> 49:16.344
for next time.

49:16.475 --> 49:18.085
Go for John.

49:18.216 --> 49:20.827
So, yeah, we had one of our
office temps listen to them.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.395
They didn't know what to make of
them. They're all saved here in
her machine.

49:23.525 --> 49:25.179
Y'all get some coffee?

49:29.531 --> 49:31.142
<i>Hello. Hi, Liz.</i>

49:33.013 --> 49:34.797
<i>I called you earlier and you
picked up.</i>

49:37.931 --> 49:41.500
<i>I'd like to check the cost of
toner for my printer <i>
system.</i></i>

49:41.630 --> 49:43.284
Sounds like he's touching
himself.

49:43.415 --> 49:44.546
Stop talking.

49:44.677 --> 49:47.158
<i>I'm calling because we spoke
earlier...</i>

49:47.288 --> 49:50.988
<i>and I'm looking to provide
new toner for all of my <i>
businesses.</i></i>

49:51.118 --> 49:54.078
<i>I'll call back, or let
me know with whom I can <i>
speak.</i></i>

49:55.340 --> 49:57.907
<i>Yeah, yeah. I guess that's
everything.</i>

49:58.038 --> 49:59.518
"We spoke earlier."

49:59.648 --> 50:01.172
Who pays the phone bill around
here?

50:01.302 --> 50:02.521
"With whom." He said, "With
whom," right?

50:02.651 --> 50:03.957
It sounds like he's on a
highway. Play it again.

50:04.088 --> 50:05.437
All the calls came from that
same number.

50:05.567 --> 50:07.787
He hung up on the rest.
Are you even sure it's him?

50:07.917 --> 50:09.615
-Yeah, we're pretty sure
it's him.
-Oh, it's definitely him.

50:09.745 --> 50:11.573
Thank you so much for bringing
this to our attention.

50:11.704 --> 50:13.184
You're not gonna tell anybody
about this...

50:13.314 --> 50:14.837
otherwise it could be your fault
if we don't catch the guy.

50:14.968 --> 50:16.013
My fault?

50:16.143 --> 50:17.840
How could any of this be my
fault?

50:17.971 --> 50:20.669
Yeah, thank you.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.237
We're again all so sorry for
your loss.

50:35.554 --> 50:37.034
<i>It's wiped clean.</i>

50:37.164 --> 50:38.557
Maybe from the snow. I don't
know. I'm not getting anything.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.167
All right, you keep working.

50:40.298 --> 50:41.777
I'm gonna have somebody come by
and hacksaw it off the slab.

50:41.908 --> 50:43.083
Look, John, if he's gonna pull
prints off of a deer carcass...

50:43.214 --> 50:44.389
he's not gonna leave them here.

50:44.519 --> 50:47.566
Do your job! Do your job!
I am begging you!

50:47.696 --> 50:49.394
You have anything else
you need to do today?

50:49.524 --> 50:51.265
No? Good! Do your job!

50:51.396 --> 50:53.050
It's like kindergarten.

50:57.141 --> 50:58.055
Utah.

50:59.882 --> 51:03.147
<i>A curfew is in effect tonight
in the town of Snow Hollow...</i>

51:03.277 --> 51:08.326
<i>due to the ongoing unsolved
murder cases that many are <i>calling the Snow Hollow Horror.</i></i>

51:08.456 --> 51:12.591
<i>The Sheriff's Department
has declined to comment to
Eyewitness Five.</i>

51:19.424 --> 51:23.645
<i>We have every reason to
believe that this monster <i>
will show up again tonight.</i></i>

51:23.776 --> 51:25.082
All right.

51:25.212 --> 51:27.432
We will have radio silence
until we can be certain.

51:30.217 --> 51:31.566
<i>-I want all cars on their tens.-Fuck!</i>

51:31.697 --> 51:32.828
<i>Is that understood?</i>

51:32.959 --> 51:34.439
Yes, sir.

51:34.569 --> 51:38.138
When the call comes in,
make it clear, make it obvious.

51:38.269 --> 51:41.750
<i>Tell us the address.
You will have instant backup.</i>

51:41.881 --> 51:46.190
I won't ask you to pray with me
'cause of the goddamn lawyers.

51:48.496 --> 51:51.108
Let's have a moment of silence.

51:57.462 --> 51:58.637
Let's hear it.

51:58.767 --> 51:59.899
Hurrah!

52:10.692 --> 52:12.781
Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.
Come here, come here.

52:12.912 --> 52:14.827
-It's okay, it's okay.
-Just get in the chair,
I'll be all right.

52:14.957 --> 52:16.220
-No, no.
-I'm all right.

52:16.350 --> 52:18.309
I'm calling an EMT
and you're going in tonight.

52:18.439 --> 52:19.962
Why didn't you just tell
somebody you needed help? Why
didn't you stay at home?

52:20.093 --> 52:20.920
I can still do it.

52:21.050 --> 52:22.356
No. Dad, stop.

52:22.487 --> 52:24.271
That's it. I'm done.

52:24.402 --> 52:25.751
I can't do this anymore.

52:26.186 --> 52:27.274
It's over.

52:27.405 --> 52:29.711
You're retired. I'm through.

52:39.808 --> 52:41.245
Go get him.

52:42.507 --> 52:43.986
Yeah.

52:44.117 --> 52:47.251
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

52:51.516 --> 52:54.867
Carla, call an ambulance.
Sheriff's gotta go to the
hospital tonight.

52:54.997 --> 52:57.522
He has a heart murmur and you
can't fucking tell anybody about
it, okay?

52:57.652 --> 52:59.263
Please just fucking do this for
me, I can't do it myself.

52:59.393 --> 53:00.438
I've got this.

53:00.568 --> 53:01.526
Yeah?

53:02.309 --> 53:04.093
I got it.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.052
Yeah, all right.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.446
Okay. Tell him...

53:08.576 --> 53:09.838
It's okay.

53:09.969 --> 53:11.753
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

53:11.884 --> 53:13.842
All right. Okay.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.341
<i>And now there's the whole
curfew thing.</i>

53:34.472 --> 53:35.255
<i>Why should I?</i>

53:40.956 --> 53:42.306
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

53:43.524 --> 53:45.178
-Yeah? <i>
-Yeah.</i>

53:46.048 --> 53:47.485
You wanna see me tonight?

53:48.137 --> 53:49.226
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

53:50.792 --> 53:52.707
<i>I'm coming over right now. I
love you.</i>

53:52.838 --> 53:54.753
-Okay, bye. I love you. <i>
-Yeah, bye.</i>

54:05.111 --> 54:06.330
Are you sure we're good here?

54:06.460 --> 54:08.941
Yes, I'm sure. Stop worrying.

54:09.071 --> 54:10.159
What if somebody sees us?

54:10.290 --> 54:11.422
No one's gonna see us.

54:11.552 --> 54:12.945
We're not supposed to be out
here right now.

54:13.075 --> 54:14.729
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.731
We're fine, okay?

54:16.862 --> 54:18.385
If we get in trouble, it's on
you.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.082
Okay?

54:27.089 --> 54:28.134
Squeeze me.

54:28.613 --> 54:29.962
You sure?

54:30.092 --> 54:31.137
Pretty sure.

54:40.364 --> 54:41.756
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.

54:41.887 --> 54:42.801
Fuck.

54:42.931 --> 54:44.106
-What?
-It's the neighbor.

54:44.237 --> 54:45.804
-Put your pants on.
-What?

54:46.326 --> 54:48.459
Neighbor, sorry.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.294
What?

54:59.470 --> 55:01.210
<i>-Station for one.
-Go for John.</i>

55:01.341 --> 55:03.169
<i>Fox Creek and Hyde.</i>

55:08.043 --> 55:10.219
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

55:10.350 --> 55:11.656
Start the car.

55:11.786 --> 55:13.745
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my
God!

55:13.875 --> 55:16.530
Start the car. Start it! Start
it now!

55:37.812 --> 55:39.248
-Damn it!
-Dad!

55:44.253 --> 55:45.951
Jenna.

55:46.081 --> 55:47.256
What are you doing here?

55:47.387 --> 55:49.824
I don't know. I was with Brock.

55:49.955 --> 55:51.043
Where's Brock at?

55:51.173 --> 55:52.697
I don't know. I don't know.

55:52.827 --> 55:54.612
He left you?

55:54.742 --> 55:56.657
Jenna, you can't do this. I
can't be worrying about you like
this.

55:56.788 --> 55:57.832
I'm at work right now.

55:57.963 --> 56:00.618
You're not even gonna ask if I'm
okay?

56:00.748 --> 56:02.446
No, I'm not gonna ask if you're
okay!

56:02.576 --> 56:04.361
You're supposed to be at home
right now!

56:04.491 --> 56:07.625
You're breaking curfew, making
out with some guy in a fucking
truck...

56:07.755 --> 56:10.105
almost getting murdered in the
street!

56:10.236 --> 56:13.631
Goddamn it! Do you have any idea
what your mom's gonna say about
me?

56:17.939 --> 56:18.984
Oh, fuck you.

56:21.203 --> 56:24.903
Fucking asshole. Fucking
wannabe.

56:25.033 --> 56:26.731
Go back to your conference!

56:26.861 --> 56:29.560
I've been looking at the back of
your head for the last 17 years,
Dad!

56:30.517 --> 56:32.171
Fucking unbelievable!

56:32.301 --> 56:35.348
You never said,
"Congratulations. Good job. I'm
so proud of you."

56:35.479 --> 56:37.132
You did shit!

56:37.263 --> 56:40.962
I'm going to college and I
cannot wait to stay with other
people!

56:41.093 --> 56:42.834
I'd rather live with strangers
than be with you!

56:42.964 --> 56:45.880
<i>Officer Gutierrez here. I'm
in pursuit.</i>

56:46.011 --> 56:47.795
I'm bleeding from the skull.
Take me to the fucking hospital!

56:47.926 --> 56:48.883
<i>Hey, I need backup.</i>

58:16.797 --> 58:18.582
<i>Who do you think you are?
Get out of this house!</i>

58:18.712 --> 58:19.713
<i>Oh, my God, get out of here!</i>

58:19.844 --> 58:21.585
Oh, my God, get out of this
house!

58:21.715 --> 58:23.282
What are you doing in here?
Get out!

58:23.412 --> 58:25.327
Get out of here! Oh, my God!

58:25.458 --> 58:27.286
Who do you think you are?
Get out of here! Get out!

58:27.416 --> 58:28.853
-Stop! Stop!
-Get out of here! Brock!

58:30.028 --> 58:32.421
Get off of him! Brock!

58:32.552 --> 58:35.729
Get off of him! Get off of him!
Get off of him!

58:43.041 --> 58:43.998
Stay back.

58:49.961 --> 58:51.310
What did you do?

58:51.440 --> 58:52.398
Jesus!

58:52.529 --> 58:53.573
Why is he here?

58:53.704 --> 58:55.270
What did you do to that poor
girl?

59:13.332 --> 59:14.376
Dad?

59:14.507 --> 59:16.161
Hey, sweetie.

59:16.291 --> 59:17.858
How's your head?

59:19.425 --> 59:20.469
No.

59:20.992 --> 59:22.123
Dad.

59:38.139 --> 59:39.619
Where have you been?

59:42.404 --> 59:44.581
I was protecting the family.

1:00:02.990 --> 1:00:04.862
<i>What do you mean I'm not
invited?</i>

1:00:04.992 --> 1:00:07.081
Since when is anybody not
invited?

1:00:07.212 --> 1:00:09.257
It's probably not a good idea
right now.

1:00:09.388 --> 1:00:10.737
Ben, it's me you're talking to.

1:00:10.868 --> 1:00:13.044
If it were Ricky, I understand,
but it's me.

1:00:13.174 --> 1:00:14.393
<i>I'm hearing you.</i>

1:00:14.523 --> 1:00:16.395
<i>No, you're not hearing me...</i>

1:00:16.525 --> 1:00:17.483
<i>because you keep fucking
putting your hand up and <i>
not letting me in.</i></i>

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:18.658
<i>Do the steps.</i>

1:00:18.789 --> 1:00:19.920
Just do the steps.

1:00:20.051 --> 1:00:21.356
I'm about to step to you right
now.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:25.665
Hey, John.

1:00:27.798 --> 1:00:29.103
Hey, Carla.

1:00:29.930 --> 1:00:31.192
How are you?

1:00:31.323 --> 1:00:33.542
You're parked in the middle of
the street, honey.

1:00:34.152 --> 1:00:35.327
Am I really?

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:40.027
-Did somebody call you?
-They did.

1:00:40.158 --> 1:00:41.333
<i>Hey, we love you, John.</i>

1:00:41.463 --> 1:00:43.422
Oh, yeah? Everybody loves me?
That's great.

1:00:43.552 --> 1:00:45.380
Why don't you call the fucking <i>
Tribune</i>and tell them how
much you...

1:00:45.511 --> 1:00:48.253
Hey, Dean, you gotta fucking
tell your wife to stop posting
that shit.

1:00:48.383 --> 1:00:50.081
-She doesn't know what she's
talking about.
-Man, hey, come on.

1:00:50.211 --> 1:00:52.344
She's an amateur sleuth.
She has none of the evidence.

1:00:52.474 --> 1:00:55.086
In fact, tell your wife to print
out all her little Facebook
posts...

1:00:55.216 --> 1:00:56.391
and roll them up and sit on
them.

1:00:56.522 --> 1:00:57.828
Eat shit, Dean.

1:01:03.181 --> 1:01:04.312
I'm leaving.

1:01:05.226 --> 1:01:07.272
<i>I slept for an hour in a corner.</i>

1:01:09.013 --> 1:01:11.058
I keep thinking he's gonna be in
here.

1:01:12.190 --> 1:01:14.192
Did you want me to move it?

1:01:15.584 --> 1:01:17.891
I bet you're not gonna let me,
huh?

1:01:19.153 --> 1:01:21.547
No, I bet I'm not.

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:50.707
Dad?

1:02:00.455 --> 1:02:01.979
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:02:02.109 --> 1:02:03.197
Dad, are you okay?

1:02:03.328 --> 1:02:04.329
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:02:04.459 --> 1:02:05.722
What are you covered in?

1:02:06.679 --> 1:02:08.333
It's from the car.

1:02:08.463 --> 1:02:09.900
Did you crash your car?

1:02:10.683 --> 1:02:12.206
No. Relax.

1:02:13.599 --> 1:02:16.341
I was pulling out of the
station...

1:02:16.471 --> 1:02:19.518
and my headlights clipped a
column on the way out.

1:02:19.648 --> 1:02:22.042
And I got so angry about it...

1:02:22.173 --> 1:02:24.479
I just drove as fast as I could
into the column.

1:02:25.698 --> 1:02:27.569
This is from the airbags.

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:32.574
<i>Come on!</i>

1:02:33.097 --> 1:02:34.011
Okay. Okay.

1:02:34.141 --> 1:02:36.535
Okay. Okay, it's all okay.

1:02:36.665 --> 1:02:38.145
Just let me lay down up here
for a minute.

1:02:38.276 --> 1:02:39.973
Just let me lay down up here
for a minute, honey.

1:02:40.104 --> 1:02:41.366
No, you have to...

1:02:41.496 --> 1:02:42.628
Just let me lay down here
for a minute.

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:44.717
Dad! Come on!

1:02:44.848 --> 1:02:46.153
-Okay.
-Dad!

1:02:46.284 --> 1:02:47.589
Okay. Okay.

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:48.590
Please!

1:02:48.721 --> 1:02:50.027
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1:02:53.944 --> 1:02:57.251
I told him I'd catch him and I
didn't.

1:02:57.382 --> 1:03:00.646
I looked him in the face and I
told him I'd catch him and I was
drunk.

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:02.822
Just go to bed!
Please just go to bed.

1:03:02.953 --> 1:03:05.825
Don't tell me to go to bed.
I don't need a parent.

1:03:08.697 --> 1:03:12.527
39 years old, I'm stuck in
Summit County being a fucking
asshole.

1:03:12.658 --> 1:03:14.268
I am an asshole!

1:03:14.399 --> 1:03:15.661
Orphan.

1:03:16.967 --> 1:03:18.707
Please just go to bed.

1:03:18.838 --> 1:03:21.754
You'll feel better in the
morning. You're just depressed,
I promise.

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:25.453
My father's face.

1:03:25.584 --> 1:03:27.238
You're scaring me. Just go to
bed!

1:03:29.370 --> 1:03:30.807
Go to bed!

1:04:17.244 --> 1:04:18.202
John.

1:04:18.332 --> 1:04:19.246
Yeah.

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:22.162
You all right?

1:04:24.251 --> 1:04:25.078
Yeah.

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:28.168
You got the flu again?

1:04:30.475 --> 1:04:32.433
Did you need something?

1:04:33.521 --> 1:04:35.262
We found the guy.

1:04:54.499 --> 1:04:55.804
<i>Pharmaceuticals.</i>

1:04:57.719 --> 1:05:00.548
6-foot-5. Local guy.

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:03.464
Wolf tattoo.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:06.032
Exotic knife collection, weird
shit.

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:09.993
Guy thought he was Wolverine.

1:05:10.123 --> 1:05:12.691
They searched his back garden
and found Helena Gaines.

1:05:12.821 --> 1:05:14.388
Remember her?

1:05:14.519 --> 1:05:17.696
Still looking for his costume.
But they might not find it.

1:05:17.826 --> 1:05:19.741
Syringes are made out of silver.

1:05:19.872 --> 1:05:22.440
Half mile from the original
crime scene.

1:05:22.570 --> 1:05:24.311
I'm gonna tell the press.

1:05:24.442 --> 1:05:27.401
My daughter could've solved
this, and she's six.

1:05:29.316 --> 1:05:31.362
You threw that bottle at us.

1:05:34.974 --> 1:05:37.237
No, I didn't.

1:05:37.368 --> 1:05:38.978
Your daughter's about to lose
all of her friends at school...

1:05:39.109 --> 1:05:41.546
because her father's not gonna
be working in this county
anymore.

1:05:41.676 --> 1:05:43.678
Somebody tell Gary he's fired.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.610
Do you wanna lay your seat back?
Get some sleep?

1:06:02.741 --> 1:06:04.177
No, I'm fine.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:10.836
Carmen Gutierrez came by the
house the other night and
talked.

1:06:11.576 --> 1:06:12.838
It was terrible.

1:06:14.579 --> 1:06:16.320
I would've caught the guy.

1:06:16.450 --> 1:06:19.105
You would not have caught the
guy, okay? You would've gotten
killed.

1:06:19.236 --> 1:06:22.543
Gotta knock it off with this
shit. You're making everybody
miserable.

1:06:23.370 --> 1:06:24.806
We got him.

1:06:24.937 --> 1:06:26.983
You still win when the other guy
knocks the eight-ball in.

1:06:27.722 --> 1:06:29.159
I'm right up here.

1:06:29.289 --> 1:06:30.856
I don't like you driving.

1:06:34.207 --> 1:06:36.383
You know it's my wedding
anniversary today?

1:06:39.430 --> 1:06:40.387
I'm fine.

1:06:41.910 --> 1:06:43.782
I'm gonna do these returns.

1:06:44.435 --> 1:06:45.827
Happy New Year.

1:06:46.524 --> 1:06:47.351
Hey.

1:06:48.308 --> 1:06:50.571
Can you hang on just a second?

1:06:53.313 --> 1:06:55.533
This is the job.

1:06:55.663 --> 1:06:58.014
And it sucks. Often.

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:01.321
But you're gonna lose
a lot more than that...

1:07:01.452 --> 1:07:03.715
if you don't start focusing
on the important stuff.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:08.285
You wanna be sheriff?

1:07:08.415 --> 1:07:10.678
How about we start acting like
one?

1:07:23.952 --> 1:07:25.389
Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic.

1:07:25.519 --> 1:07:26.738
Hi, John.

1:07:28.827 --> 1:07:30.829
This is gonna be tough.

1:07:30.959 --> 1:07:33.049
Hi, Mrs. Marten. I'm with the
Sheriff's Department.

1:07:33.179 --> 1:07:35.225
I got some property of Hannah's
that we took as evidence.

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:37.314
I just need you to sign
something to say you got it
back?

1:07:37.444 --> 1:07:38.402
Okay.

1:07:50.936 --> 1:07:52.720
<i>I started drinking again.</i>

1:07:52.851 --> 1:07:54.070
<i>Stress.</i>

1:07:54.809 --> 1:07:56.202
<i>I became a monster.</i>

1:07:57.290 --> 1:08:00.685
Tough to be around. Hateful.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:03.253
I lied to my dad.
Last thing I said to him.

1:08:06.169 --> 1:08:08.171
-Mr. Taxter.
-Yeah.

1:08:08.301 --> 1:08:10.173
I'm coming from the Sheriff's
Department. I have some evidence
I have to return.

1:08:10.303 --> 1:08:11.522
Yeah, I know what those are.

1:08:11.652 --> 1:08:14.525
I was rude to Carla.

1:08:14.655 --> 1:08:19.356
And I had hateful thoughts
toward Ricky and his whole
family.

1:08:22.359 --> 1:08:24.230
<i>When you're having a nervous
breakdown...</i>

1:08:24.361 --> 1:08:27.712
<i>the only clue that you
have that anything is <i>
terribly wrong...</i></i>

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:29.496
<i>with your life...</i>

1:08:29.627 --> 1:08:33.457
are the wonderful people around
you who keep asking...

1:08:33.587 --> 1:08:35.241
"Is everything okay?"

1:08:36.590 --> 1:08:39.115
And you just go, "Yeah."

1:08:47.297 --> 1:08:49.212
<i>When we were tracking the
suspect...</i>

1:08:49.342 --> 1:08:50.604
Killer.

1:08:50.735 --> 1:08:53.868
Or when we were putting together
early evidence...

1:08:53.999 --> 1:08:55.522
to find the suspect...

1:08:55.653 --> 1:08:57.133
-Killer.
-Yeah.

1:08:57.263 --> 1:08:59.004
Okay. I'm working on it.

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:00.745
Just give me a second on that
one.

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:03.095
I'm working on a lot here,
Ricky.

1:09:03.226 --> 1:09:04.662
Miss Fairchild, hi.

1:09:04.792 --> 1:09:06.316
I'm with the Sheriff's
Department.

1:09:06.446 --> 1:09:09.057
I have some property that we
took as evidence from Liz...

1:09:11.277 --> 1:09:12.191
Fuck!

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:29.643
This is Julia Robson.

1:09:29.774 --> 1:09:31.732
<i>Hey, it's PJ Palfrey.</i>

1:09:31.863 --> 1:09:35.649
You and another officer came by
a while back and you guys forgot
something here.

1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:38.696
I was just wondering if there's
an address you guys wanted me to
ship it to?

1:09:38.826 --> 1:09:41.916
Yeah, you can just ship it to
the Snow Hollow Police
Department.

1:09:42.047 --> 1:09:43.483
We can put it in storage.

1:09:43.614 --> 1:09:45.311
No, we're gonna keep the stuff.

1:09:45.442 --> 1:09:47.922
You guys just left this little
sewing thing here that's not
ours.

1:09:49.141 --> 1:09:51.012
-I'm sorry? <i>
-It looks old.</i>

1:09:51.143 --> 1:09:53.232
It's like a seam ripper I guess?

1:09:53.363 --> 1:09:55.539
I'm not sure. My mom told me to
call you guys about it.

1:09:56.931 --> 1:09:57.932
Hello?

1:10:02.981 --> 1:10:04.287
Mr. Carnury?

1:10:04.983 --> 1:10:06.941
Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Paul.

1:10:07.072 --> 1:10:08.378
I'm with the Sheriff's
Department.

1:10:08.508 --> 1:10:10.206
I have some evidence
we took a few months ago.

1:10:10.336 --> 1:10:12.295
I just need you to sign
something saying you got it
back.

1:10:14.253 --> 1:10:16.299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me grab that...

1:10:16.429 --> 1:10:18.475
but, come in.
Yeah, come on in.

1:10:18.605 --> 1:10:19.650
You want coffee?

1:10:19.780 --> 1:10:22.000
No, it's fine.
I just need a signature.

1:10:45.328 --> 1:10:46.981
How do you like it?

1:10:47.112 --> 1:10:48.548
Sorry. You frightened me.

1:10:48.679 --> 1:10:50.855
I just need a signature.

1:10:50.985 --> 1:10:52.378
No, no, no. Come sit. Please.

1:10:52.509 --> 1:10:54.119
I wanna hear all about the case.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:57.209
I mean, you can talk about it
now, isn't that right?

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:04.782
Well, I mean, I hate to say
there is not much to tell.

1:11:04.912 --> 1:11:07.393
The <i>Tribune</i>did a pretty
good job with their write-up.

1:11:07.524 --> 1:11:13.704
The suspect... or the killer
had priors for battery.

1:11:13.834 --> 1:11:16.968
It was solid policework but just
some things slipped through the
cracks.

1:11:17.098 --> 1:11:18.491
Doesn't happen often.

1:11:18.622 --> 1:11:21.320
Well, that's good to hear.

1:11:21.451 --> 1:11:23.104
Is there anything we could do
to help the police?

1:11:23.235 --> 1:11:25.063
I mean, as townsfolk or
something?

1:11:25.193 --> 1:11:27.195
No. Not much more
than what you've done already.

1:11:27.326 --> 1:11:29.285
Thank you so much for letting us
hold on to that evidence.

1:11:29.415 --> 1:11:31.025
Hope it wasn't an inconvenience.

1:11:31.156 --> 1:11:32.810
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's fine.

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:38.076
Mind if I spill something in
your coffee?

1:11:40.078 --> 1:11:41.819
I'd like that.

1:11:46.824 --> 1:11:48.565
Wife away for the weekend?

1:11:50.610 --> 1:11:52.830
I'm not married.

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.572
I'm sorry. No, I was joking
about the...

1:11:55.702 --> 1:11:56.486
I'm sorry.

1:11:56.616 --> 1:11:58.618
No, no. It's fine.

1:11:58.749 --> 1:12:00.533
I'm not opposed to the idea.

1:12:01.142 --> 1:12:03.319
I was once.

1:12:04.363 --> 1:12:05.625
But...

1:12:09.063 --> 1:12:10.543
She couldn't hack it.

1:12:11.979 --> 1:12:14.025
I hear that.

1:12:14.155 --> 1:12:16.157
And your daughter? She's doing
fine?

1:12:18.116 --> 1:12:22.686
Yeah, we got her going to
college for scholarships.

1:12:22.816 --> 1:12:27.255
She's got gymnastics
for school in January, and...

1:12:37.788 --> 1:12:39.877
I better shove off.
I'm on the clock.

1:12:40.007 --> 1:12:42.140
But thank you so much for this,
Mr. Carnury.

1:12:43.533 --> 1:12:44.534
Yeah.

1:12:58.461 --> 1:13:00.201
You forget something?

1:13:00.332 --> 1:13:02.029
No, I'm sorry, Paul.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:03.944
Something you said threw me.

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:05.685
Stupid.

1:13:06.599 --> 1:13:08.471
So stupid.

1:13:08.601 --> 1:13:11.474
But I'm wondering if you
wouldn't mind standing up to
your full height for me.

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:34.932
Yeah.

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:42.200
Goddamn it!

1:13:42.330 --> 1:13:44.724
We got one. I'm at 244 Maple.

1:13:44.855 --> 1:13:46.683
I'm at 244 Maple.
I got suspect on the move.

1:13:46.813 --> 1:13:48.424
Can I get backup, ASAP?

1:16:14.221 --> 1:16:16.354
Are you okay?

1:16:49.822 --> 1:16:53.521
You got laundry down the hall.
I packed you some detergent.

1:16:53.652 --> 1:16:55.915
Did your mom text and say
when she's getting here?

1:16:56.046 --> 1:16:59.658
She said she can't make it after
all because of the traffic.

1:16:59.789 --> 1:17:01.617
That's a shame.

1:17:01.747 --> 1:17:04.010
You know, you didn't have to
come here if you were busy.

1:17:04.141 --> 1:17:05.708
I wasn't busy. It was nothing.

1:17:05.838 --> 1:17:08.145
Actually pretty quiet at the
station.

1:17:08.275 --> 1:17:13.063
You know, I thought it'd be a
nice trip and got some stuff to
do in town.

1:17:13.193 --> 1:17:14.673
And with everything else going
on, I never get to...

1:17:16.457 --> 1:17:18.634
Whoa. Whoa. What's up?

1:17:19.678 --> 1:17:21.114
It's just a lot.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.552
Yeah.

1:17:25.423 --> 1:17:27.599
Well, I'm proud of you.

1:17:29.819 --> 1:17:31.081
I'm proud of you.

1:17:33.170 --> 1:17:34.301
Yeah.

1:17:34.432 --> 1:17:37.043
Thanks. I had to cut a hole in
the back.

1:17:37.174 --> 1:17:38.871
They don't make 'em for
ponytails.

1:17:41.352 --> 1:17:44.660
Well, call us when you're
settled and I will help you out
with that registration.

1:17:46.009 --> 1:17:48.315
You get everything figured out?

1:17:48.446 --> 1:17:50.013
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1:17:51.057 --> 1:17:52.276
Be safe.

1:18:02.982 --> 1:18:03.940
Hey.

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:09.206
I love you.

1:18:18.824 --> 1:18:21.566
And, speaking of safety...

1:18:21.697 --> 1:18:23.829
I left something in your top
drawer.

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.918
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

1:18:26.049 --> 1:18:27.398
For protection.

1:18:27.528 --> 1:18:28.573
Disgusting!

1:18:28.704 --> 1:18:31.881
No! Stop! Stop!
Just leave, please. Dad.

1:18:32.011 --> 1:18:33.230
God!

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:36.102
I'll just...
Let me call you later, okay?

1:18:44.632 --> 1:18:45.633
Jesus.

1:18:51.639 --> 1:18:52.902
Oh, my God.

1:19:11.311 --> 1:19:14.097
Dude, the whole gymnastics team
just moved in down the hallway.

1:19:14.227 --> 1:19:15.359
Babes.

1:19:15.489 --> 1:19:17.187
All right. Fresh meat.
