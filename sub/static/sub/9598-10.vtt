That's not gonna make her
get here any faster.

01:06.631 --> 01:07.998
[sighs]

01:08.033 --> 01:10.000
Maybe not,
but it'll prove my point.

01:10.035 --> 01:11.435
Which is...?

01:11.470 --> 01:14.405
Which is if she'd taken
Boylston Street like I said,

01:14.473 --> 01:16.774
she would have been here
10 minutes ago.

01:16.808 --> 01:19.310
She may not have the letter. 
[sighs]

01:19.344 --> 01:22.346
I went to see the department
doctor a week ago.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.415
I was fine then.
I'm finer now.

01:24.449 --> 01:26.617
It's just taking them too long
to clear me for duty.

01:26.651 --> 01:29.478
Okay, look, I know how badly you really

01:29.479 --> 01:32.523
want to get back to
work, but I must admit

01:32.591 --> 01:34.058
that it's been really nice
having you here,

01:34.092 --> 01:35.559
and I'm sad
that you're leaving.

01:35.594 --> 01:38.062
Me too.

01:38.096 --> 01:39.597
So sad.

01:39.631 --> 01:42.946
You know, you couldn't be
happier if I told you that I had

01:42.947 --> 01:46.036
magically turned all the
lettuce in the world into beer.

01:46.104 --> 01:48.038
Make it happen.
We'll find out.

01:48.106 --> 01:49.774
[keys jingling]

01:53.512 --> 01:54.645
[grunts]

01:54.713 --> 01:56.447
You should consider
buying some luggage.

01:56.515 --> 01:58.215
Everybody thought
I was homeless.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.852
Bags don't show dirt.
I'll take that.

02:04.656 --> 02:06.257
[exhales deeply]

02:06.291 --> 02:08.324
It's not in ...
Ma, is this everything?

02:08.393 --> 02:11.695
Yeah. Look, I understand
you're disappointed,

02:11.730 --> 02:14.799
but the doctor must think that
you need some more time to heal.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.668
No, I need to go back
to my own apartment

02:17.736 --> 02:20.704
and my job so I can feel
like a grown woman.

02:20.739 --> 02:24.140
A grown woman who uses
garbage bags for luggage.

02:24.342 --> 02:26.605
But I see your point.
[chuckles]

02:27.546 --> 02:31.182
Lie down.
I'll get you some snacks.

02:31.249 --> 02:33.684
What am I supposed to do
all day ...

02:33.718 --> 02:38.455
lay here and dream
about a world with no salad?

02:38.490 --> 02:41.525
Oh, you could read magazines,
and you could ...

02:41.560 --> 02:43.093
you could just let your mom
take care of you.

02:43.161 --> 02:45.196
Okay, but as my best friend
and a doctor,

02:45.230 --> 02:47.565
- will you do me one favor?
- Anything.

02:47.599 --> 02:50.134
Put me in a medically
induced coma. [chuckles]

02:50.168 --> 02:52.503
- I'm going to the market.
- Just one little coma.

02:52.537 --> 02:54.371
Is it really too much to ask?

02:54.406 --> 02:56.707
You'd have better luck asking me
to give you oxycontin.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.109
[sighs]

02:59.144 --> 03:00.778
Well, can I have some of those, then?

03:00.812 --> 03:03.147
[sighs]

03:03.181 --> 03:04.748

<b>5x10 - Phoenix Rising</b>

03:29.307 --> 03:32.243
Hell of a way to get my attention, Rick.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.678
- Well, thanks for coming, Vince.
- As if I had a choice.

03:34.713 --> 03:37.248
I've barely seen you since high
school, you tell me you're dying,

03:37.282 --> 03:39.483
and I'm the only one you can
trust with your final request.

03:39.517 --> 03:42.419
Well, what can I say? You won
the last-request competition.

03:42.454 --> 03:45.556
- [chuckles] Who came in second?
- Guy in cellblock "D."

03:45.590 --> 03:47.391
[chuckles]

03:47.425 --> 03:49.593
So, listen, Vince, um...

03:49.661 --> 03:54.365
I got six months left... tops.

03:54.432 --> 03:57.051
I don't want to die with
my son still thinking that

03:57.052 --> 03:59.670
I set the fire that killed
his mother and his sister.

03:59.738 --> 04:03.207
- Hey, I'm a cop, not a hypnotist.
- I did not set that fire.

04:03.241 --> 04:06.610
Even if that's true, Rick, you
have exhausted all your appeals.

04:06.678 --> 04:09.713
I don't care about the courts.
Listen to me.

04:09.781 --> 04:14.885
My son only knows me as this
selfish, lying, fall-down drunk.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.857
- That's not who I am anymore.
- I'll call him.

04:19.891 --> 04:22.226
See if he'd be willing
to come by and say goodbye.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.329
He won't. He doesn't want
to hear from me.

04:25.363 --> 04:28.238
After I got locked up,
I wrote him a letter a week ...

04:28.239 --> 04:30.434
sometimes two.
He never responded.

04:30.468 --> 04:31.969
About three years ago,

04:32.003 --> 04:34.204
the letters started coming back
with no forwarding address.

04:34.272 --> 04:37.574
Listen to me, Vince.
The only way my son will see me

04:37.609 --> 04:41.779
is if he knows I did not set
that fire, which I did not.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.847
I swear it.

04:43.882 --> 04:47.251
Well, you seem like you've
gotten your act together in here.

04:47.285 --> 04:51.288
Sometimes, prison does that for people.
Write another letter.

04:51.323 --> 04:53.657
I'll find Jason.
I'll take it to him myself.

04:53.692 --> 04:56.660
[sighs]

04:56.695 --> 04:58.662
You were the smartest guy
in the neighborhood,

04:58.697 --> 05:00.631
and you've been a smart cop
for a long time.

05:00.665 --> 05:05.536
Vince, all I'm asking is that you
just ... take a look at my case.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.937
Give it two or three hours,

05:07.005 --> 05:09.840
and if you're not convinced,
then just walk away.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.041
Don't give it another thought.

05:15.313 --> 05:17.541
I'll take a look.
[sighs]

05:17.576 --> 05:19.350
But no promise
about what happens after that.

05:19.417 --> 05:22.019
[sighs] Thank you.

05:26.591 --> 05:28.058
[door buzzes]

05:28.093 --> 05:29.727
[sighs]

05:31.329 --> 05:36.066
- She wanted to massage my feet.
- Well, that's very nice.

05:36.101 --> 05:39.269
Yes, when I was 3.
Now it's just a little weird.

05:39.337 --> 05:41.405
You almost died.
She's your mother.

05:41.439 --> 05:44.541
She's just having some kind
of a post-traumatic response.

05:44.576 --> 05:45.642
[knock on door]

05:45.677 --> 05:46.710
Uh, come in.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.482
Sorry to bother you
on a Saturday night.

05:51.516 --> 05:53.684
What a surprise.
Thank you.

05:53.718 --> 05:56.787
Barolo 2009.
What's the occasion?

05:56.821 --> 05:58.956
Well, I've been looking
over a case from awhile back,

05:58.990 --> 06:00.820
and I was hoping you'd
be willing to look

06:00.821 --> 06:02.693
at yesterday's science
through today's lens.

06:02.761 --> 06:05.362
- How old is old?
- Wow. 15 years.

06:05.397 --> 06:08.298
Double homicide, arson.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.869
Rick Sullivan. Mm.
Killed his wife and child.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.837
Did you get your
medical-release letter yet?

06:13.905 --> 06:16.373
No.

06:16.441 --> 06:18.575
- Sorry.
- Oh, Vince, come on.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.344
The department rules
are clear ...

06:20.378 --> 06:21.930
no department business until you've

06:21.931 --> 06:23.614
got a doctor's okay to return to duty.

06:23.648 --> 06:26.884
It's a file that
I'm reading at hom...

06:26.918 --> 06:28.752
No, someone else's home.

06:28.787 --> 06:31.062
Technically, it's department business.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.994
You were in the drug unit
15 years ago.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.328
This isn't even your case.

06:38.396 --> 06:41.899
No. And I'm annoyed at myself
for saying yes I would do it.

06:41.933 --> 06:45.768
But it's hard to tell
a dying man to buzz off,

06:45.803 --> 06:47.771
especially if you've known him
for 50 years.

06:47.806 --> 06:49.973
You're a very good man, Vince.

06:50.008 --> 06:51.842
Yes.
And a bit of a hard-ass

06:51.910 --> 06:54.711
when it comes to some
of your closest friends.

06:54.746 --> 06:57.347
It's a day or two.
You'll be fine.

06:57.415 --> 06:58.916
[sighs]

06:58.950 --> 07:00.517
I went through the files.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.586
The D.A. had a pretty
strong case against him.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.876
Rick was a broke alcoholic, and his wife

07:04.877 --> 07:07.357
had an insurance policy
worth 750,000 bucks.

07:07.392 --> 07:10.794
The clincher...
is the arson report.

07:10.829 --> 07:12.830
<i>Maura: They found acetone on his pants.</i>

07:12.864 --> 07:15.666
<i>It's the same accelerant that
was used to start the fire.</i>

07:15.700 --> 07:18.836
Korsak: When we were kids, Rick
would give you the shirt off his back.

07:18.870 --> 07:21.638
He took a lot of hits protecting
his sisters from his dad.

07:21.706 --> 07:24.141
If the science says
he did it, he did it.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.577
All I promised him
was a fair look.

07:26.644 --> 07:29.646
Well, I guess
we should get started.

07:29.681 --> 07:32.683
And when I say "we," of course,
I mean the two of you

07:32.717 --> 07:34.952
because I'm not cleared
for duty, so...

07:34.986 --> 07:37.688
Good luck.
Good night.

07:37.722 --> 07:42.092
- Sleep well.
- I did not see that coming.

07:47.765 --> 07:50.767
- Thanks for coming in on Sunday.
- No problem.

07:50.802 --> 07:51.969
I just figure while Maura's
looking at the forensics,

07:52.003 --> 07:54.838
it wouldn't hurt to take
another look at the shoe leather.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.409
I was just sitting here for a minute.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.080
Like we talked about ... better
than leaving it empty all the time.

08:03.114 --> 08:04.915
Well, the table was
pretty packed anyway.

08:04.949 --> 08:06.483
Yeah, where'd that come from?

08:06.518 --> 08:09.052
I brought up the archives
in case we needed them.

08:10.755 --> 08:13.724
- Did you know them well?
- I never even met the wife.

08:13.791 --> 08:15.859
Saw Rick and his daughter
in a park a couple times.

08:15.894 --> 08:19.830
- A cute kid.
- Yeah.

08:19.864 --> 08:22.466
So I've been through
the interviews with Rick.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.002
Over five days, he never once
changed his story.

08:25.036 --> 08:28.539
He said he got drunk and
blacked out like most nights,

08:28.606 --> 08:31.008
came to coughing up smoke
in the yard.

08:31.042 --> 08:33.466
The son, Jason, was lucky
that tree was right outside

08:33.467 --> 08:35.846
- his bedroom window.
- I doubt it felt lucky at the time.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.881
Yeah. Were you able
to track him down?

08:37.948 --> 08:41.118
He's married with a baby.
They live in Dedham.

08:41.152 --> 08:43.654
- You gonna talk to him?
- Not unless we find something.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.085
The kid's been through enough.
If we don't get traction,

08:46.151 --> 08:48.058
we're gonna do this
for one day. That's it.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.760
We're not looking to overturn
a conviction here ...

08:49.827 --> 08:51.992
just looking for doubt.

08:53.531 --> 08:56.033
[cellphone vibrates]

08:56.067 --> 08:59.203
- Maura wants to talk to me.
- Well, I'm all set here.

08:59.237 --> 09:01.751
I'll let you know if I find anything.

09:03.808 --> 09:05.209
[sighs]

09:09.948 --> 09:13.050
All right, I was thinking
about going over to Rudy's

09:13.084 --> 09:16.019
and picking up your favorite
pastrami sandwich.

09:16.054 --> 09:19.556
- Uh-huh.
- Hello?

09:19.624 --> 09:21.058
<i>I mean, I usually mention Rudy's,</i>

09:21.092 --> 09:24.061
and you're at the front door
with car keys in your teeth.

09:28.566 --> 09:30.033
What are you doing, Ma?

09:30.068 --> 09:33.770
Just wondering what's
grabbed your attention.

09:33.805 --> 09:40.210
Uh... I was just reading
this fascinating article ...

09:40.278 --> 09:44.181
"10 ways to please my man

09:44.215 --> 09:50.787
and make him happy as
a clam... with a candle."

09:54.692 --> 09:58.128
- Well, that's a new one.
- It's fascinating stuff.

09:58.196 --> 10:02.799
Huh.
The candle or the clam?

10:03.834 --> 10:07.004
I'm sorry. What ... you
were saying something before?

10:07.038 --> 10:09.339
Yeah, um...
[clears throat]

10:09.374 --> 10:13.243
I was gonna go to Rudy's
and pick us up some sandwiches.

10:13.278 --> 10:14.678
Oh, really? Yeah.

10:14.712 --> 10:16.647
I ... that sounds great.
I'd love that.

10:16.681 --> 10:18.649
All right.
I'll be back in a bit.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.289
[door opens, closes]

10:33.981 --> 10:37.984
- Thanks.
- Least I could do. So?

10:38.019 --> 10:40.854
So, I looked over everything.

10:40.888 --> 10:44.447
The burn pattern and depth of
charring indicate a fire that burned

10:44.448 --> 10:47.794
unusually hot, so I took another
look at the victims' autopsies.

10:47.828 --> 10:49.295
M.E. said they died
of smoke inhalation.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.898
Well, in 1999,
that was the catchall term

10:51.932 --> 10:54.510
used to describe
inhalation-type death,

10:54.630 --> 10:58.133
but five years ago, a study out
of Johns Hopkins demonstrated that

10:58.134 --> 11:01.908
some S.I. cases are actually deaths
from breathing superheated air.

11:01.942 --> 11:05.578
- How hot is superheated?
- It instantly sears your airways,

11:05.613 --> 11:07.914
causing death long
before smoke and flame.

11:07.948 --> 11:09.582
What does this mean for Rick?

11:09.617 --> 11:14.000
The fire in the Sullivan home was
too hot to be caused by acetone alone.

11:14.922 --> 11:17.991
The arson unit determined that
acetone was the only fire accelerant,

11:18.025 --> 11:19.893
and the D.A.'s case
hinged on that point.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.261
They were wrong.

11:21.295 --> 11:23.797
[sighs]

11:23.831 --> 11:27.734
- I thought you'd be more pleased.
- Oh, I'm...

11:27.802 --> 11:30.236
I guess I was pretty sure
I'd be walking away from this.

11:30.271 --> 11:34.841
Well, my findings do not absolutely
exclude Rick as a suspect.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.976
No, but it's enough
to make me glad

11:37.011 --> 11:39.212
I didn't tell him
I wouldn't help him.

11:39.246 --> 11:42.115
Thanks. I'm sure Rick would
say thank you if he could.

11:42.149 --> 11:46.967
Well, I'm glad,
but I'm doing this for you.

11:51.659 --> 11:54.795
I have confirmed these are
the most up-to-date lists on

11:54.796 --> 11:58.098
flash points and flame temperatures
for flammable chemicals.

11:58.165 --> 12:00.600
Great.
I'm ready to get started.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.102
Well, thank you for doing this
on the weekend.

12:02.169 --> 12:05.171
I really do need your expertise to
run this fire-simulation program.

12:05.206 --> 12:07.345
No problem. I'd much
rather be here than at home

12:07.346 --> 12:09.309
being mad at myself for
not going sightseeing.

12:09.343 --> 12:10.810
[chuckles]

12:10.845 --> 12:13.299
Using the crime-scene
photos, I created a digital

12:13.300 --> 12:15.949
replica of the Sullivan
house, focusing on the hallway.

12:15.983 --> 12:18.885
This is the simulation
for 100% acetone.

12:22.923 --> 12:25.658
Exactly as I expected.
The flame temperature

12:25.693 --> 12:29.129
doesn't rise above 390 degrees,
and that's just not hot enough

12:29.163 --> 12:30.764
to generate superheated smoke.

12:30.798 --> 12:35.668
- Any thoughts on what it could be?
- Mhm. Let's try ether.

12:35.703 --> 12:39.168
Its flame temperature is high ...
about 3,500 degrees.

12:39.203 --> 12:40.206
[computer beeps]

12:43.911 --> 12:47.296
That's too hot. That would
result in more charring

12:47.297 --> 12:50.083
than what we saw in
the crime-scene photos.

12:59.293 --> 13:02.395
There are no hardwood floors
in their house.

13:02.429 --> 13:07.700
It's all carpet and linoleum.
Wait a minute.

13:11.372 --> 13:14.674
It's not that the chemist
didn't find the other accelerant.

13:14.742 --> 13:16.810
It's that he misunderstood
what it was.

13:16.844 --> 13:20.113
- I'm sorry...?
- The answer that we need ...

13:20.147 --> 13:22.448
it was in this report all along.

13:22.483 --> 13:25.952
[cellphone rings]

13:25.986 --> 13:28.354
- Hey.
- About Korsak's case...

13:28.389 --> 13:30.390
How about "hello.
How are you?"

13:30.457 --> 13:34.194
Hello.
And about Korsak's case...

13:34.228 --> 13:35.895
What do you know about it?

13:35.963 --> 13:37.831
Frankie, there's no time
for that. Listen.

13:37.865 --> 13:41.167
Rick was a suspect because he had
two motives to kill his wife ...

13:41.202 --> 13:43.102
One, she was having an affair.

13:43.137 --> 13:46.806
- Two, she had a life-insurance policy.
- Okay.

13:46.841 --> 13:49.570
Well, motive was moved to the
back burner when they found

13:49.571 --> 13:52.111
acetone on his pants, which
means that no one confirmed

13:52.146 --> 13:53.379
who Tanya's boyfriend was.

13:53.414 --> 13:57.750
So he couldn't be eliminated
as a suspect.

13:57.785 --> 13:59.953
Wait. How do you know
any of this?

13:59.987 --> 14:01.087
<i>[vehicle approaches]
You haven't been cleared ...</i>

14:01.121 --> 14:03.912
Just find the boyfriend.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.163
[humming]

14:20.774 --> 14:22.308
[keys jingle]

14:22.376 --> 14:24.410
Hey. Hot pastrami.

14:24.445 --> 14:27.881
Oh, I could think
of nothing else.

14:30.050 --> 14:34.280
The original chemist tested 38
materials inside the Sullivan home...

14:34.281 --> 14:38.024
drywall, door sills,
fabric, foam, plastic ...

14:38.092 --> 14:39.826
Are you gonna list
all the materials he tested?

14:39.860 --> 14:41.794
Yes.

14:41.829 --> 14:44.264
This is usually when Jane says,
"get to the point"

14:44.331 --> 14:45.832
before she's overcome
with an urge to strangle me

14:45.866 --> 14:48.902
- with her bare hands.
- I miss her.

14:48.936 --> 14:52.743
The chemist found, uh, substantial
amounts of acetone, as well

14:52.744 --> 14:56.309
as traces of other chemicals
that he discounted as burn-off.

14:56.377 --> 14:58.371
Meaning the stuff left behind
from everything

14:58.372 --> 15:00.681
- that melted in the fire?
- Yes. And one of those

15:00.682 --> 15:03.750
discounted chemicals
was toluene, a solvent.

15:03.784 --> 15:06.152
But it would only have been
present as a burn-off

15:06.186 --> 15:08.187
if the Sullivans
had hardwood floors.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.555
- Which they didn't.
- Exactly.

15:09.590 --> 15:11.668
So, the D.A. was wrong about there being

15:11.669 --> 15:14.057
only one fire accelerant,
which is why we need

15:14.058 --> 15:16.329
to retest Rick's clothes
for the presence of toluene.

15:16.363 --> 15:18.932
If you don't find any, how does
that prove Rick didn't set the fire?

15:18.966 --> 15:20.233
The acetone and toluene

15:20.267 --> 15:22.268
had to have been poured
from a single container.

15:22.336 --> 15:25.338
Otherwise, we would be seeing
two burn patterns, not one.

15:25.372 --> 15:27.173
So it would be impossible
for Rick to get splattered

15:27.207 --> 15:29.469
with one chemical
and not the other?

15:29.910 --> 15:32.211
And when we test his jeans,
if there's no toluene...

15:32.246 --> 15:34.314
We have forensic proof
that Rick is innocent.

15:34.348 --> 15:37.517
- Wow.
- On a scale of 1 to 10,

15:37.551 --> 15:40.039
how happy are you
you didn't tell him to buzz off?

15:41.422 --> 15:42.789
Homicide cases ...

15:42.823 --> 15:46.392
- Tanya Sullivan and Becky Sullivan?
- Right.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.361
These aren't your cases, Vince.

15:48.395 --> 15:51.030
- They're not even open.
- I know.

15:51.065 --> 15:54.040
- Just grab the files for me, will you?
- Sure, just as soon as

15:54.041 --> 15:57.503
I get the okay from the
lead detective and the D.A.

15:57.538 --> 16:03.936
Two signatures, easy-peasy.
That's BPD-2410 and 2413.

16:04.445 --> 16:07.213
- What?
- I need the files now.

16:07.247 --> 16:09.215
Oh, no.
Everything is time-stamped.

16:09.249 --> 16:11.184
- Once I get the forms...
- You will.

16:11.218 --> 16:13.820
- ...And then you'll get the files.
- A guy is dying in prison.

16:13.887 --> 16:15.355
We're all dying, Vince.
Oh, come on, Smitts.

16:15.389 --> 16:18.524
- Do the right thing here.
- I am. I'm following the rules.

16:18.559 --> 16:20.893
So forms and procedures
and time stamps ...

16:20.928 --> 16:22.862
they're more important
than justice?

16:22.896 --> 16:26.366
- Didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

16:35.031 --> 16:39.368
- Don't forget to wash it first.
- But it says "prewashed."

16:40.353 --> 16:41.820
Really?

16:43.256 --> 16:45.691
[telephone rings]

16:45.725 --> 16:48.093
Hello?

16:48.128 --> 16:51.196
<i>Vince: Evidence lockup won't
play ball and give us the jeans.</i>

16:51.231 --> 16:52.798
We need the evidence
to get the D.A.'s permission,

16:52.832 --> 16:54.633
but we need the D.A.'s
permission to get the evidence.

16:54.667 --> 16:58.337
- Well, talk about a Catch-22.
- Smitts won't budge at all?

16:58.371 --> 17:00.472
Oh, he doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

17:00.507 --> 17:03.509
Like he ate a rule book, and
it got stuck in his colon.

17:03.576 --> 17:05.444
That's not
how digestion works.

17:05.478 --> 17:08.247
I know, but you asked me
to be more delicate when I say,

17:08.314 --> 17:10.617
"that guy's got a rule book
stuck up his..."

17:11.550 --> 17:16.121
- I got nothing.
- Well, there's got to be someone

17:16.189 --> 17:18.290
who can go
over this guy's head.

17:18.358 --> 17:20.659
<i>Oh. Nobody's gonna put their ass
on the line for a guy like Rick.</i>

17:20.727 --> 17:22.327
So, after all this,

17:22.395 --> 17:24.128
it just comes down
to a heartless bureaucracy?

17:24.164 --> 17:27.366
Yeah, I-I guess.
I guess it does.

17:29.569 --> 17:30.969
Tanya Sullivan had a boyfriend?

17:32.505 --> 17:37.409
Uh, I mean, uh, if ...
if she had a boyfriend,

17:37.443 --> 17:39.611
then that would be
a new lead. Am I right?

17:39.646 --> 17:41.754
"If Rick not guilty ..."

17:41.755 --> 17:44.917
That should say "isn't guilty."

17:44.951 --> 17:48.720
<i>uh, "the real arsonist
had a motive."</i>

17:48.755 --> 17:50.289
The real arsonist had a motive.

17:50.356 --> 17:52.424
You know what?
Those are my good cloth napkins.

17:52.458 --> 17:56.249
Can't you just write on a piece
of paper like a normal person?

17:56.863 --> 17:58.463
You took files out of the box,
didn't you?

17:58.498 --> 18:00.666
What do you mean?
What does he mean?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.467
Not many.

18:02.502 --> 18:05.704
<i>I should be mad that
you ignored department policy,</i>

18:05.738 --> 18:07.606
but sometimes your blatant
disregard for the rules

18:07.640 --> 18:09.441
works to my advantage.
Tell me what you got.

18:09.475 --> 18:11.810
Apology accepted.

18:11.845 --> 18:13.879
[chuckles]

18:15.882 --> 18:17.583
<i>Jane was right. </i>

18:17.617 --> 18:21.186
Tanya Sullivan got arrested
a few weeks before the fire.

18:21.254 --> 18:24.756
She was in an altercation in a
bar, but the charges were dropped.

18:24.791 --> 18:27.192
I tracked down every witness
in the report.

18:27.227 --> 18:29.862
- Anybody got a good memory?
- Uh, one person remembered

18:29.896 --> 18:31.897
Tanya was with a guy
who went by "Sal."

18:31.931 --> 18:35.701
- Short for...?
- Salvador Briglio.

18:35.735 --> 18:37.369
He's 15 years older now,

18:37.403 --> 18:38.604
but the description the
witness gave still matches.

18:38.638 --> 18:40.372
How'd you get him?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.627
Uh, I just cross-referenced
variations of the name "Sal" with

18:43.628 --> 18:46.712
parking tickets issued near the
bar where Tanya got arrested.

18:46.746 --> 18:49.882
- So he's a regular?
- Five to six nights a week.

18:49.949 --> 18:51.817
And he ran his mouth off
a lot, too.

18:51.851 --> 18:57.322
One person overheard Sal
warning Tanya

18:57.357 --> 18:59.491
to sleep with one eye open.

18:59.525 --> 19:02.995
He said he was gonna kill her
and her loser husband.

19:03.029 --> 19:05.831
- How long before the fire was that?
- Uh, a few weeks.

19:05.865 --> 19:09.368
It was probably a breakup fight.
Tanya told him to get lost.

19:09.402 --> 19:12.471
I'll bet he hated losing Tanya
to a drunk like Rick.

19:12.505 --> 19:13.772
Well, the year of the fire,

19:13.806 --> 19:17.140
Sal worked at a full-service
marina in Falmouth.

19:17.443 --> 19:20.345
Guess which chemicals are used
in deck paint and boat maintenance.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.915
- Acetone and toluene.
- Yep.

19:22.949 --> 19:25.417
I think this could be our guy.

19:25.451 --> 19:28.620
I was very impressed
with your work yesterday.

19:28.688 --> 19:30.647
Oh, I just hit
some computer keys.

19:30.772 --> 19:32.692
You did the hard part.

19:33.459 --> 19:35.527
I'm sure thankful I don't wear
that getup anymore.

19:35.561 --> 19:37.396
Polyester chafes like
you wouldn't believe.

19:37.463 --> 19:39.731
Is it pure polyester?
Not even a blend?

19:39.766 --> 19:41.600
- Pure.
- Ooh.

19:41.668 --> 19:43.969
Detective Rizzoli. Great
to have you back at work.

19:44.037 --> 19:45.804
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not back at work.

19:45.872 --> 19:47.572
Oh. Well, you look
fantastic anyway.

19:47.607 --> 19:50.075
Thank you, Nina.

19:50.109 --> 19:54.346
You look ... not like you at all.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.981
Yeah. What's the vibe
you're getting?

19:56.015 --> 19:59.284
Like... stuffy,
uptight, professional?

19:59.319 --> 20:02.020
Wait a minute.
That's ... that's my suit.

20:02.055 --> 20:07.025
And what do you mean, "stuffy"?
And that's my blouse.

20:07.093 --> 20:09.561
Well, I didn't think you would mind.

20:09.629 --> 20:11.096
I've never seen you wear this outfit.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.998
Well, because it isn't an outfit.

20:13.032 --> 20:15.400
That blouse is eveningwear,
and the suit is for work,

20:15.435 --> 20:16.969
which is why the skirt
is knee-length.

20:17.003 --> 20:19.738
Or, at least,
it's supposed to be.

20:19.772 --> 20:21.807
Okay, Jane, what's really
going on here?

20:21.874 --> 20:24.109
What do you mean?

20:24.143 --> 20:27.746
Why are you dressed
like a flight attendant?

20:27.780 --> 20:29.748
First of all, I'm dressed
like a librarian.

20:29.782 --> 20:31.817
I'm wearing glasses on a chain,
for god's sake.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.452
Have you ever checked out a book?

20:33.486 --> 20:35.620
Well, have you ever been
on a plane?

20:35.655 --> 20:37.889
Because that scarf
you're wearing screams,

20:37.924 --> 20:39.858
"in the event of a water landing,

20:39.892 --> 20:43.495
your seat cushion can also be
used as a floatation device."

20:46.499 --> 20:48.867
- That better?
- Much.

20:48.935 --> 20:52.904
Good. I got to be 100% librarian
if I'm gonna pull this off.

20:53.629 --> 20:57.042
Pull what off?
What just happened?

20:57.076 --> 21:01.413
Wow. I haven't heard the
name Tanya Sullivan in years.

21:01.447 --> 21:02.781
Were you romantically
involved with her?

21:02.849 --> 21:05.751
Sure. I was involved with
a lot of women back then.

21:05.785 --> 21:08.553
Tanya was arrested at a bar
a few weeks before she died.

21:08.588 --> 21:11.490
- You know why?
- Long time ago.

21:11.524 --> 21:12.958
15 years.
But a lot of people

21:12.992 --> 21:15.127
still remember your fight
with Tanya that night.

21:15.161 --> 21:16.628
What was it he said, again?

21:16.662 --> 21:20.499
"I'll kill you. I'll kill you
both ... you and that loser."

21:20.566 --> 21:24.669
And my personal favorite, "sleep
with one eye open, you bitch."

21:24.704 --> 21:28.073
- That's pretty vivid stuff, Sal.
- I was a hothead.

21:28.107 --> 21:29.408
I said a lot of stupid stuff.
I didn't mean it.

21:29.442 --> 21:32.377
- Sounded pretty mad.
- I treated Tanya like a queen.

21:32.445 --> 21:34.479
Her husband treated her
like garbage,

21:34.514 --> 21:38.182
but she cuts me loose
so she can work on her marriage.

21:39.452 --> 21:40.786
Look where that got her.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.187
Yeah, let's look
at where that got her.

21:42.221 --> 21:44.756
She burned to death
in the middle of the night

21:44.791 --> 21:46.691
with her 7-year-old daughter.

21:46.726 --> 21:48.560
Did you know her kids were
in the house? Did you care?

21:48.594 --> 21:50.595
I didn't know
because I didn't do this.

21:50.630 --> 21:52.964
- I wasn't even there.
- Yeah, where were you?

21:52.999 --> 21:57.202
On a fishing boat with four
other guys, 24/7 for a week.

21:58.938 --> 22:01.854
Names and numbers.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.077
[sighs]

22:09.082 --> 22:10.482
You know, I don't even know

22:10.516 --> 22:11.616
why you're bothering
with this, man.

22:11.651 --> 22:14.686
- Excuse me?
- Rick Sullivan set that fire,

22:14.720 --> 22:18.678
and nobody who knew him
has any doubt about that.

22:19.525 --> 22:20.759
[sighs]

22:22.028 --> 22:25.831
<i>Sit tight, Sal.
[door opens]</i>

22:25.865 --> 22:29.868
Uh, thanks.
His alibi's airtight.

22:29.902 --> 22:32.471
He was 40 miles offshore ...
the Susan Marie.

22:32.505 --> 22:36.141
- [sighs] I'm sorry. You okay?
- We got a guy sitting in jail

22:36.175 --> 22:38.143
for a crime we don't think
he committed.

22:38.177 --> 22:40.979
Pretty far from okay.

22:46.262 --> 22:49.864
Thanks. 
D.A.'s at a fundraiser in Cambridge.

22:49.899 --> 22:51.979
Why don't I talk to him,
and you try and wrangle the

22:51.980 --> 22:53.902
other signature we need
to get the jeans released?

22:53.936 --> 22:55.670
Why don't you just test them now?

22:57.139 --> 22:58.940
Oh, I know.
Get it all out ...

22:58.974 --> 23:02.305
- rules, policy, blah, blah, blah.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:02.390 --> 23:04.480
Right now, I'm just
so grateful that you're

23:04.481 --> 23:05.980
so stubborn you don't
care about getting fired.

23:08.584 --> 23:11.553
- I could get fired?
- Department rule 110, section 27 ...

23:11.587 --> 23:13.822
"officers on medical leave."
[chuckles]

23:14.056 --> 23:16.224
You're learning a lot
studying for that test.

23:16.258 --> 23:19.694
This is ... this is just
between us, right?

23:22.598 --> 23:24.666
How did you get Smitts
to give you the jeans?

23:24.733 --> 23:26.100
What ... you didn't see
the wall calendar

23:26.135 --> 23:30.171
with all the sexy women
chewing on their glasses?

23:31.106 --> 23:33.608
Last month was the librarian.

23:37.246 --> 23:42.328
No?
And you call yourselves "detectives."

23:48.357 --> 23:50.692
There is acetone on Rick's jeans.

23:50.726 --> 23:52.927
We knew that
from the original test.

23:52.962 --> 23:54.963
However, there are
no other chemical signatures

23:54.997 --> 23:58.733
that can connect him to the
fire ... specifically, toluene.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.201
Well, if the acetone
didn't get on Rick

24:00.235 --> 24:01.903
from starting the fire,
where did it come from?

24:01.937 --> 24:03.871
I pulled up his medical records,
and the night of the fire,

24:03.906 --> 24:05.607
Rick was taken
to the emergency room

24:05.674 --> 24:07.375
and treated for nausea
and stomach pains.

24:07.409 --> 24:08.943
From smoke inhalation.

24:08.978 --> 24:10.712
I thought so, too, until
I read the lab results.

24:10.779 --> 24:13.781
Rick has a condition called
alcoholic ketoacidosis.

24:13.816 --> 24:17.118
- Can you take maalox for that?
- [chuckles] Not quite.

24:17.186 --> 24:20.655
Heavy drinking caused his body
to produce an excess of acetone.

24:20.689 --> 24:23.124
The only way for the body
to rid itself of the acetone

24:23.158 --> 24:25.093
is through urination.
Paragraph two.

24:25.127 --> 24:28.029
"The test sample contained
a strong concentration

24:28.063 --> 24:30.264
of acetone, uric acid,
and ammonia."

24:30.332 --> 24:33.668
- Urine?
- Correct.

24:33.702 --> 24:36.304
So the acetone on his pants
isn't from starting a fire.

24:36.372 --> 24:39.305
I can't wait to see the look on the
D.A.'s face when I show him this ...

24:39.306 --> 24:41.642
that our proof that Rick
Sullivan didn't kill his family

24:41.643 --> 24:42.810
is that he pissed his pants.

24:50.085 --> 24:51.753
Jason Sullivan?

24:51.787 --> 24:54.188
Sergeant Detective Korsak,
Boston homicide.

24:54.223 --> 24:55.423
Oh, my god.

24:55.457 --> 24:57.759
Did something happen
to my wife? My son?

24:57.793 --> 24:59.093
No, no, no, no.
They're fine.

24:59.128 --> 25:00.228
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

25:00.262 --> 25:03.831
- [sighs] Um, what's this about, then?
- Your father.

25:06.268 --> 25:08.436
I hope you've come to tell me
that he's dead.

25:08.470 --> 25:10.838
No.

25:10.873 --> 25:12.674
There's new evidence
that could exonerate him.

25:12.741 --> 25:15.910
Is this new evidence gonna bring
back my mother and my sister?

25:15.944 --> 25:17.712
Look, Jason, I know
that's a terrible loss,

25:17.746 --> 25:19.647
but it's not something
I believe your father did.

25:19.715 --> 25:22.984
- Just leave me alone, sergeant.
- I know it's hard to take it in.

25:23.018 --> 25:25.173
No, what's hard to take was
having a father who drank

25:25.174 --> 25:27.288
away his paycheck and tried
to kill his entire family.

25:27.322 --> 25:29.824
You want me to believe 
he didn't do it?

25:29.858 --> 25:32.331
You show me the guy who did.

25:38.434 --> 25:40.201
Hey, Ma.

25:40.235 --> 25:43.337
Hi. How come you're dressed
like a... flight attendant?

25:43.372 --> 25:45.740
Librarian.

25:45.774 --> 25:47.875
Playing dress-up ...
it's kind of strange,

25:47.910 --> 25:51.045
but, you know, when you're bored
and have nothing else ...

25:51.080 --> 25:55.149
I went to headquarters, Ma.
I had to help out Korsak.

25:57.419 --> 26:01.689
You, uh ... you really love
your job, don't you?

26:01.757 --> 26:06.325
When are you gonna get it?
I love what I do.

26:17.773 --> 26:20.408
This came for you two days ago.

26:23.045 --> 26:26.414
- Is that from the department doctor?
- Yeah. [sighs]

26:27.148 --> 26:32.153
- You hid this from me?
- I wasn't ready for you to go back.

26:34.022 --> 26:35.990
Well, that's not your decision, Ma.

26:36.024 --> 26:40.762
I know, and I-I hate it.
I hate this whole thing.

26:40.796 --> 26:44.966
I hate the fact that you have a job
where you can get hurt so easily.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.135
I don't even know
if I'm cleared, so...

26:47.169 --> 26:48.803
I steamed it open.

26:51.206 --> 26:55.543
- No.
- You can go back in two days.

26:55.577 --> 26:58.279
Yes! Aah!
Ma! Thank you.

26:58.313 --> 27:00.882
- Ohh, thank you.
- Oh, yeah, "wonderful news."

27:00.916 --> 27:03.417
- That's just wonderful.
- Oh, come on.

27:03.452 --> 27:07.955
- I'm ready.
- Well, I'm not, Jane.

27:07.990 --> 27:11.225
I fixed you up, and now
you're gonna go back out there,

27:11.260 --> 27:14.195
and ... and I'm gonna
stay here and worry.

27:14.229 --> 27:16.030
[sighs]

27:16.064 --> 27:19.267
Not tonight.
Okay?

27:19.301 --> 27:20.902
Come on.
Tonight, it's just ...

27:20.936 --> 27:24.071
it's just you and me, all right?

27:24.106 --> 27:26.440
And ... and we'll ...
we'll watch a movie,

27:26.475 --> 27:28.509
and we'll sit here on the couch,

27:28.577 --> 27:31.212
and you can massage my feet
if you want to,

27:31.246 --> 27:33.181
even though I hope you don't.

27:33.515 --> 27:36.984
Come on.
What do you want to watch?

27:37.019 --> 27:38.252
[sighs]

27:42.224 --> 27:45.293
I'm gonna go make
some grilled cheese.

27:45.327 --> 27:46.360
[sighs]

27:46.395 --> 27:49.831
- I love you, Ma.
- Well, you're only saying that

27:49.865 --> 27:53.257
because you're getting your way.

27:54.837 --> 27:57.104
[scoffs]

28:10.419 --> 28:12.486
Do you understand what I just said?

28:12.521 --> 28:15.990
I might be able to convince the D.A.
to overturn the conviction.

28:19.328 --> 28:24.232
- Did you talk to Jason?
- Yes.

28:24.266 --> 28:27.068
What'd he say?

28:29.905 --> 28:32.306
[sighs]

28:32.374 --> 28:35.576
All right.
Don't get me wrong, Vince.

28:35.644 --> 28:37.345
I'd love to get out of here.

28:37.379 --> 28:40.514
It's just that ... the only jury
I care about is my son.

28:40.582 --> 28:43.517
If he still thinks I'm guilty,
then I'm guilty.

28:45.420 --> 28:49.423
But I appreciate it.
Thank you.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.215
You're a better man
than I remember.

29:00.168 --> 29:02.637
[door buzzes]

29:09.769 --> 29:12.238
- That was the D.A.
- He'll reopen the case?

29:12.272 --> 29:13.839
If we come up with more
than 15-year-old jeans.

29:13.873 --> 29:15.474
You come up with anything?

29:15.508 --> 29:17.743
Uh, I talked to a lot of people
who didn't like Rick.

29:17.811 --> 29:21.013
Bartenders, owner of the liquor store,
a bunch of people he owed money to.

29:21.047 --> 29:22.448
Any of them look good for the arson?

29:22.482 --> 29:24.416
No, they're all regular
people ... working stiffs.

29:24.451 --> 29:26.285
None of them would have
set fire to his house.

29:26.319 --> 29:27.997
Still, Jane's right. 
Somebody had to

29:27.998 --> 29:29.955
have a motive to kill
Rick and his family.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.257
[sighs]

29:31.324 --> 29:33.158
I'll recanvass, talk to the neighbors.

29:33.193 --> 29:36.128
Ah, maybe time loosened up
a few tongues.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.800
<i>Woman: Sorry, detective.</i>

29:41.835 --> 29:43.102
<i>We didn't buy the house
until after the fire.</i>

29:43.136 --> 29:45.437
Yeah, in fact, the fire
was a blessing of sorts.

29:45.472 --> 29:47.873
You know a woman and her
daughter died in that fire?

29:47.907 --> 29:50.776
[sighs] That's not
what my husband meant.

29:50.810 --> 29:53.879
It's just that, well,
we drove by the day after,

29:53.913 --> 29:55.814
- just to check it out.
- Yeah.

29:55.849 --> 29:57.950
To see if there was
potential to rebuild

29:58.018 --> 30:00.886
and maybe make a better offer
than the insurance company?

30:00.954 --> 30:03.188
Yes, but when we got here,

30:03.223 --> 30:05.524
we saw the sign in the window
of the house next door.

30:05.558 --> 30:07.359
Yeah, no realtor ...
just a number.

30:07.394 --> 30:09.461
In fact, the seller
didn't even negotiate.

30:09.529 --> 30:11.930
Just accepted our first offer
over the phone.

30:11.965 --> 30:13.065
The owner wanted
to make a quick sale?

30:13.099 --> 30:15.868
Yeah, I guess. He never even
showed up to the closing.

30:15.935 --> 30:19.138
Remember that? He just gave
our lawyer a power of attorney.

30:19.172 --> 30:24.309
- Do you remember that guy's name?
- Melvin Tuttle.

30:25.345 --> 30:28.480
<i>Frankie: He's got a few felony
assault and battery charges,</i>

30:28.548 --> 30:31.917
but mostly drug stuff ...
for cooking and selling crystal meth.

30:31.951 --> 30:34.809
Field interrogation/observation
reports show Melvin was

30:34.810 --> 30:37.923
associating with a local biker
gang ... the Devil's Scorpions.

30:37.957 --> 30:41.427
Sounds like a typical
outlaw-biker drug operation.

30:41.461 --> 30:44.897
- The scorpions supply the chemicals.
- And Melvin cooks the meth.

30:44.931 --> 30:49.568
Still [sighs] it doesn't explain
why Melvin sells his house

30:49.602 --> 30:51.837
and takes off right after the fire...

30:51.871 --> 30:53.872
unless he was responsible
for it in some way.

30:53.907 --> 30:55.307
[computer beeps]

30:55.342 --> 30:58.110
[sighs] We'll never know.
Six weeks after the fire,

30:58.178 --> 31:01.280
Melvin Tuttle was stabbed to
death in Jacksonville, Florida.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.284
[sighs]

31:07.320 --> 31:09.988
<i>Korsak: Melvin Tuttle might
have burned the house down,</i>

31:10.056 --> 31:12.124
- but why would he?
- I don't think he did.

31:12.158 --> 31:14.493
I mean, come on.
The guy takes off to Florida.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.128
He's dead six weeks later?

31:16.162 --> 31:18.330
I'm betting he ran because
somebody was after him.

31:18.365 --> 31:21.100
How long until Melvin's
homicide file gets here?

31:21.134 --> 31:22.968
Jacksonville's digging it
out of cold cases.

31:23.036 --> 31:24.536
- Said they'd overnight it to us.
- All right.

31:24.571 --> 31:26.305
Well, we can keep working
while we wait.

31:26.339 --> 31:28.941
Is it possible they were
in business together?

31:28.975 --> 31:32.144
I could recheck the forensics
and see if I can identify

31:32.178 --> 31:34.646
any meth by-products
in the Sullivan house.

31:36.649 --> 31:40.252
We need to nail down a connection
between Rick and Melvin Tuttle.

31:40.286 --> 31:43.188
Yeah, and figure out
why someone wanted them both dead.

31:43.223 --> 31:45.557
I'm gonna go back and work
with Frankie and Nina.

31:45.592 --> 31:48.127
I will see you tomorrow
at BPD, detective.

31:48.161 --> 31:50.195
See you tomorrow.

31:53.499 --> 31:55.868
You got anything?

31:55.935 --> 31:58.203
Uh, the drug unit has plenty
on Melvin Tuttle.

31:58.238 --> 31:59.605
Nothing on Rick Sullivan.

31:59.639 --> 32:01.940
What about phone records
and incident reports?

32:01.975 --> 32:04.376
- We're still checking.
- There's nothing yet.

32:04.411 --> 32:06.945
<i> I didn't want to break
 the rules and show up early.</i>

32:06.980 --> 32:10.015
What have you two been doing?

32:10.049 --> 32:12.050
We're looking at old
drug-unit surveillance videos.

32:12.085 --> 32:13.919
We've pulled the ones
where Melvin was tagged.

32:13.953 --> 32:15.354
We're looking for any sign that
he and Rick knew each other.

32:15.388 --> 32:17.523
- Any luck?
- Not so far.

32:17.557 --> 32:19.558
Okay, let's ... let's look
at the next one.

32:19.592 --> 32:21.927
This is three days before
the fire. [computer beeps]

32:23.696 --> 32:26.365
That's the 1310 ...
headquarters for the Scorpions.

32:26.399 --> 32:28.200
They are not too happy with Melvin.

32:37.343 --> 32:39.344
Wait, wait.
Pause that.

32:39.412 --> 32:43.615
<i>Is that Rick's truck?</i>

32:43.650 --> 32:46.385
Nina, run a DMV check
on Rick Sullivan.

32:46.419 --> 32:49.488
[computer beeps]

32:49.522 --> 32:52.090
DMV doesn't keep records
that far back.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.992
I'll check the department of revenue.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.928
- What?
- Massachusetts charges a road tax

32:55.962 --> 32:59.264
on all vehicles registered.
Enjoy that when you buy a car.

32:59.299 --> 33:01.633
Well, Rick drove a red Chevy 1500.

33:03.436 --> 33:05.437
<i>Jane: Okay, that's a Ford.</i>

33:05.472 --> 33:09.107
Nina, pull up the exterior
crime-scene photo from the fire.

33:09.142 --> 33:10.342
[computer beeps]

33:10.376 --> 33:11.410
Hmm.

33:16.416 --> 33:19.117
Rick's red pickup truck
in his driveway.

33:19.152 --> 33:21.320
It's almost the same color as Melvin's.

33:21.354 --> 33:24.990
They live right next door to each
other, and both own red pickup trucks.

33:25.024 --> 33:27.526
So someone wanted
Melvin Tuttle dead.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.730
When they went to kill him, they
burned down the wrong house.

33:40.041 --> 33:41.675
Ma, today should be an easy day.

33:41.709 --> 33:43.944
Yeah, you're just saying that
for my sake.

33:44.011 --> 33:45.378
No, no, I'm not, really.

33:45.413 --> 33:48.315
We're waiting on a
homicide file from Florida.

33:48.349 --> 33:51.051
All I'm gonna do today is ...
is paperwork. That's it.

33:54.622 --> 33:57.357
You ready, Ma?

33:57.391 --> 34:01.495
I feel the same as I did
on your first day of school ...

34:01.562 --> 34:03.997
sending you out into a world

34:04.031 --> 34:06.733
where I can't be there
to take care of you.

34:06.768 --> 34:11.170
And I was fine that day,
and I'll be fine today.

34:11.205 --> 34:13.572
No, you came home
missing a front tooth,

34:13.641 --> 34:17.043
- fighting with that Murphy boy.
- Well, he started it.

34:17.110 --> 34:19.346
Besides, that tooth
was loose, anyway.

34:20.380 --> 34:22.349
[sighs]

34:22.416 --> 34:24.417
You could always take care
of yourself, Jane.

34:25.052 --> 34:28.621
Go ahead.
Go and knock 'em dead. [chuckles]

34:28.656 --> 34:31.591
I'm a homicide detective, Ma.
They're already dead.

34:31.626 --> 34:34.393
Don't be a smartass!
[chuckles]

34:34.462 --> 34:36.196
[both chuckle]

34:36.230 --> 34:40.199
All right. That ... I can't
move my arms. Let me go.

34:40.234 --> 34:41.434
- I know.
- Hey!

34:41.469 --> 34:42.569
- Mwah!
- Ugh!

34:42.603 --> 34:46.706
- I love you.
- [sighs] I love you, too.

34:46.741 --> 34:48.108
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

34:48.176 --> 34:49.676
[door closes]

34:53.681 --> 34:55.047
Hey, Janie.

34:55.116 --> 34:57.517
Good to have you
back... officially.

34:57.552 --> 35:00.821
- Yeah, we missed you.
- I missed you guys.

35:00.855 --> 35:02.689
[inhales deeply]

35:02.723 --> 35:05.192
Oh, it's good to be back.
[sighs]

35:05.226 --> 35:09.196
Okay, um, did that file
come in from Jacksonville?

35:09.230 --> 35:11.264
Two motorcycles were seen leaving
the area of the Tuttle murder.

35:11.299 --> 35:13.633
Witness saw a gold stripe
on the gas tank

35:13.668 --> 35:17.470
and cowboy-style saddlebags on one.
No description of the other bike.

35:17.505 --> 35:20.407
And I found this in the
organized crime unit files.

35:20.441 --> 35:23.376
What are the chances that two
motorcycles look just like that?

35:23.444 --> 35:24.811
It depends.

35:24.846 --> 35:26.513
Are we going to the gold-stripe
and saddlebag store?

35:26.581 --> 35:30.450
Henry "Blade" Vallenhurst.

35:30.484 --> 35:33.453
Oh, he was president
of the Devil's Scorpions.

35:33.521 --> 35:34.855
I doubt burning down
the wrong house

35:34.889 --> 35:36.489
would stop him
from killing Melvin.

35:36.524 --> 35:39.459
Jacksonville homicide said
there were two motorcycles.

35:40.493 --> 35:43.932
- He had an accomplice.
- So, the question is,

35:43.933 --> 35:48.401
who did he trust enough
to help him kill Melvin Tuttle?

35:50.137 --> 35:52.606
[Jane sighs]

35:52.640 --> 35:54.574
Florida is coming for you, Blade...

35:56.544 --> 35:59.112
...for the murder of Melvin Tuttle.

35:59.146 --> 36:02.616
You're talking out your ass.

36:02.650 --> 36:06.119
Well, my "ass" found two
collect calls that you made

36:06.153 --> 36:07.387
from a motel in Jacksonville

36:07.421 --> 36:09.389
the same night
that Melvin was murdered.

36:09.423 --> 36:11.291
We sent your photo
down to the locals.

36:11.359 --> 36:13.627
One person identified you.

36:13.661 --> 36:16.563
He even remembered
your scorpion tattoo.

36:16.597 --> 36:18.298
[scoffs]

36:18.332 --> 36:20.300
We know you didn't do it alone,

36:20.334 --> 36:24.738
so further research turned over
another collect call,

36:24.772 --> 36:29.309
uh, from the same room,
same date... from this guy.

36:29.343 --> 36:31.711
Robert Kincade, fellow Scorpion.

36:31.746 --> 36:34.247
He's doing 10 years in Walpole
on a drug beat

36:34.282 --> 36:37.183
because he turned down an offer
to testify against you.

36:37.218 --> 36:41.554
- And he won't say anything now.
- We thought the same thing.

36:41.589 --> 36:45.803
However, we managed to
convince him what a solid case

36:45.804 --> 36:50.330
Florida had against him, and
it seems like your pal Kincade

36:50.364 --> 36:53.633
can't really stomach the idea
of 2,200 volts of electricity

36:53.668 --> 36:55.835
<i>popping his eyeballs out of his head.</i>

36:55.870 --> 37:01.308
So I made him an offer ...
his life for yours.

37:01.342 --> 37:03.143
Now, here's the thing.

37:03.177 --> 37:07.180
I don't really care
about Melvin or Kincade.

37:07.214 --> 37:11.318
I care about the fire that
killed Tanya and Becky Sullivan.

37:11.352 --> 37:16.656
So you own up to what you did.

37:16.691 --> 37:20.460
You confess to setting
the Sullivan house on fire.

37:22.630 --> 37:26.566
You're not following.
Okay...

37:28.602 --> 37:30.437
and as much as I hate it ...

37:30.504 --> 37:36.376
Florida can't execute you
if you're doing life here.

37:42.483 --> 37:46.252
[chuckles]

37:46.287 --> 37:47.954
That damn red truck.

37:49.590 --> 37:52.659
What were the odds?

37:54.261 --> 37:57.252
Yeah, "what were the odds?"

37:57.465 --> 38:00.367
<i>You just have to walk me
through what happened.</i>

38:10.978 --> 38:13.412
[voice breaking]
My father's innocent?

38:15.449 --> 38:18.685
He's been telling the truth.

38:21.141 --> 38:23.297
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:28.829 --> 38:32.129
The D.A. filed a motion
to overturn the verdict.

38:33.034 --> 38:34.768
What does that mean?

38:34.835 --> 38:37.270
That means in two days,
your father will be a free man.

38:41.409 --> 38:42.776
[sniffles]

38:51.952 --> 38:54.320
[door buzzes]

39:01.879 --> 39:05.448
Okay.

39:05.516 --> 39:08.791
[glasses clink]
Cheers.

39:08.986 --> 39:11.554
So, is my mother boycotting
my big send-off?

39:11.589 --> 39:15.792
No, she actually went out dancing.
But she sends her love.

39:15.826 --> 39:17.627
I'm sorry. Did you say
she went dancing?

39:18.061 --> 39:21.531
- I did. She is.
- Hold on.

39:21.599 --> 39:24.884
- Where? W-With who?
- She didn't say.

39:24.885 --> 39:27.570
- You didn't ask?
- Well, Angela is a grown woman.

39:27.638 --> 39:29.172
Yes, but she can't be out clubbing

39:29.206 --> 39:32.141
in the middle of the night.
It's 9:30.

39:32.209 --> 39:33.776
Oh, Maura, don't hassle me
with the details.

39:33.844 --> 39:36.679
- My mother is missing.
- Okay.

39:36.714 --> 39:39.148
I know that it's scary,

39:39.183 --> 39:43.119
but Angela has to leave the nest
and spread her wings.

39:43.687 --> 39:45.455
That's good advice...

39:45.489 --> 39:48.725
if we were talking about
a cockatoo, which we are not.

39:48.759 --> 39:50.893
My mother has dated two men
her entire life,

39:50.928 --> 39:52.595
both of whom I knew very well.

39:52.663 --> 39:55.616
She doesn't know what men
are like. What if she leaves

39:55.617 --> 39:58.568
her drink unattended, and
somebody puts something in it?

39:58.602 --> 40:02.805
I think we all know how that
turns out, don't we? [gasps]

40:02.840 --> 40:04.507
I can't believe
you would bring that up.

40:04.575 --> 40:06.209
I can't believe you're not
concerned about my mother.

40:06.243 --> 40:08.403
Do I need to pull up
your booking photo?

40:09.613 --> 40:11.748
I think we both know
that your mother is okay.

40:11.782 --> 40:14.072
[sighs]

40:14.073 --> 40:15.218
Yeah.

40:17.554 --> 40:21.758
- So you're just gonna wait up for her?
- Well, I can't sleep now.

40:21.792 --> 40:23.192
[sighs]

40:23.227 --> 40:27.864
Well, I was going to give you
a goodbye present

40:27.898 --> 40:32.035
when you left tonight,
but apparently...

40:33.103 --> 40:34.103
Mm.

40:39.843 --> 40:40.696
[gasps]

40:40.797 --> 40:43.012
You got me luggage.

40:43.047 --> 40:45.081
They're made with
three-ply durable plastic,

40:45.149 --> 40:47.684
and they even have a
ziplock and handles.

40:47.718 --> 40:51.654
- It's perfect.
- I was gonna get you a stick

40:51.722 --> 40:53.256
with a bandana
on the end of it,

40:53.290 --> 40:55.625
but then I thought
that was too hobo-chic.

40:55.859 --> 40:59.295
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:59.330 --> 41:01.097
So, should we order a pizza?

41:01.131 --> 41:03.132
We might be waiting up
for a while.

41:03.167 --> 41:06.936
Well, you don't have to.
I'm sure you're exhausted.

41:06.970 --> 41:09.539
No, I-I doubt
I could sleep either.

41:09.573 --> 41:11.941
[sighs]

41:14.244 --> 41:19.749
- What time is it now?
- 9:36.

41:19.783 --> 41:22.735
What time do we start
calling hospitals?

41:22.789 --> 41:26.619
Not until later ...
after 10:00.

41:27.361 --> 41:29.401
10:05.

41:31.596 --> 41:35.547
Raising my mother's
a lot harder than I thought.

41:36.514 --> 41:38.279
[chuckles]
