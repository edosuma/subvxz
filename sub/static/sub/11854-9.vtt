00:07.333 --> 00:09.250
(male #1)
'I understand that.'

00:09.333 --> 00:11.333
But I'm getting paid on..

00:11.417 --> 00:13.750
I am listening,
you're not listening.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.875
- I'm getting paid--
- Hi, baby.

00:17.709 --> 00:20.083
If you'd just give me
a brief moment to..

00:20.166 --> 00:23.333
I'm not giving attitude!

00:23.417 --> 00:24.792
Hello?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.000
'Hello?'

00:28.583 --> 00:31.125
Midnight, they're
gonna shut my gas.

00:31.208 --> 00:32.333
What'd you bring?

00:32.417 --> 00:34.375
- Chicken?
- For the concert.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.291
I got to do
these bills.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.625
You should go.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.959
Honey, I can see
Nirvana anytime.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.542
You know

00:43.625 --> 00:45.917
you could ask Krystal
for the money. She'll help
you.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.875
I know.
I don't wanna
ask.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.542
I'm gonna heave that
thing out the window.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.291
Here, grandma.
Here's your
tea.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.041
Don't touch that.

01:11.583 --> 01:14.000
This is worse
than pro wrestling.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.291
Shush. You don't
know anything about
it.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.166
These guys'll bleed
every last cent.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.792
Can't take it with you.

01:21.875 --> 01:25.000
So that others might live
in the light.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.000
So, it's a
freezing
February night.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.333
I'm up, get this
call about
midnight.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.417
Oh, is this the Jamaican job?
That's a good one.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.333
Yeah, you know how Jamaican
jobs are, right?

01:54.417 --> 01:56.041
I mean,
aliases,
no papers.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.667
Give me a bag
of bones any day.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.291
Yeah, well,
I'm in a slump

01:59.375 --> 02:01.625
and I need a cake job
like you wouldn't believe.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.667
So he gets this call
out of, uh, North Central.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.041
- You telling this or me?
- No, go ahead. It's your
story.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.250
(Jeffries)
'So, anyway,
we're riding out'

02:07.333 --> 02:08.542
and I'm thinking, I hope

02:08.625 --> 02:09.625
this is not a Jamaican.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.417
Please don't let this be
a Jamaican.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.500
Do-don't finish it.
Vera, homicide.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.208
So anyway, I get out there.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.458
This guy's on the front seat,
frozen through.

02:18.542 --> 02:19.583
And he's a Jamaican.

02:19.667 --> 02:22.208
No. He's a Burmese
Buddhist monk.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.125
I take one look,
I say to Vera

02:24.208 --> 02:25.875
"Why couldn't he be Jamaican?"

02:25.959 --> 02:27.792
Hold on just a second, hold on.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.834
Hey, you couldn't wait?

02:29.917 --> 02:32.041
It's for you.
Another cold one.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.375
Why do you got
to be like that?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.000
Some of those stories
of yours I like.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.875
Uh, Detective Rush.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.709
(male #1 on phone)
'I wanna tell you
about a murder.'

02:43.792 --> 02:45.750
And this happened a while ago?

02:45.834 --> 02:48.750
'In 1989.'

02:48.834 --> 02:50.166
What's your name?

02:50.250 --> 02:52.458
'I don't wanna
tell you my name.'

02:52.542 --> 02:55.083
Okay, what do you want
to tell me?

02:55.166 --> 02:57.542
'She was elderly.'

02:57.625 --> 02:59.917
Who was elderly, the victim?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.166
'Her name was Krystal Hogan.'

03:03.250 --> 03:06.291
'At her age, there was
no defending herself.'

03:08.709 --> 03:10.166
How old was she?

03:10.250 --> 03:11.750
'Almost 81.'

03:13.291 --> 03:16.625
How is it you know
she was murdered?

03:16.709 --> 03:18.417
'I did it.'

03:55.041 --> 03:56.458
Guy confesses to murder

03:56.542 --> 03:58.291
and then he won't
tell you his name?

03:58.375 --> 03:59.792
Maybe it's a hoax.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.083
I can't find a box
on the lady.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.542
Well, it's not
Krystal Hogan

04:03.625 --> 04:05.500
but I-I seem to
remember a K. Dugan

04:05.583 --> 04:07.166
when I was on the line.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.834
Maybe an '87 job.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.709
Kendall Dugan.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.417
Drug shooting.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.333
Oh, right.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.250
So, did you run her name
through the computer?

04:20.333 --> 04:22.125
Waiting for something
to kick out.

04:22.208 --> 04:23.583
Well, there's not much
else you can do, though.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.000
(Jeffries)
'Lil?'

04:27.083 --> 04:29.709
That fellow's back on the line.

04:37.041 --> 04:38.000
You hung up on me.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.917
'I was having second thoughts.'

04:40.000 --> 04:41.166
'Now I'm not.'

04:41.250 --> 04:43.500
Well, I don't have a box
on Krystal Hogan.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.333
- Sorry.
- 'What does that mean?'

04:45.417 --> 04:49.041
No box, no body, no crime.

04:49.125 --> 04:53.166
Maybe you're just a guy
who likes talking to police.

04:53.250 --> 04:56.542
You don't believe me?

04:56.625 --> 04:58.959
I'll tell you
where the body is.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.208
Okay.

05:01.291 --> 05:06.083
'2212, Elm street.'

05:06.166 --> 05:07.333
Germantown.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.625
In the basement.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.542
Wanna tell me your name now?

05:17.000 --> 05:20.375
Guy's real up front,
or messing with me good.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.583
- Gave you an address?
- I'll run it.

05:22.667 --> 05:23.917
Don't have enough
for a warrant.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.875
So, finesse
the
neighborhood.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.166
Right. Worth a door knock.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.750
Are you Brad Meyer?

05:41.834 --> 05:43.667
Yeah. Who are you?

05:43.750 --> 05:45.333
Philadelphia police.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.667
Detective Rush.

05:46.750 --> 05:47.917
Oh, low blow.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.375
Someone called
the cops on me?

05:49.458 --> 05:52.125
No. Uh, can I talk
to you a minute?

05:52.750 --> 05:54.166
What's goin' on?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.000
This is my wife, Dana.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.417
She's police.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.667
I'm just looking into something

05:58.750 --> 05:59.750
that might have happened
around here

05:59.834 --> 06:00.917
several years back.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.625
Thought it was
about
us getting rowdy.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.166
We only moved in
eight months ago.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.083
'Maybe you should
try that lady, Joan'

06:07.166 --> 06:08.166
across the street.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.667
She brought
us a moving-in casserole

06:09.750 --> 06:12.250
and knows the neighborhood
business pretty good.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.166
Thank you.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.041
Krystal Hogan.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.792
She was an old pistol.

06:18.875 --> 06:19.792
So, you knew her?

06:19.875 --> 06:21.375
Lived right over there.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.417
When was that?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.291
10-15 years ago.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.333
She moved in with her
son's family.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.291
Then, this
was awful..

06:28.375 --> 06:30.291
The son and
his wife
died

06:30.375 --> 06:32.166
in a crash on
the turnpike.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.959
That left Krystal
alone over there

06:34.041 --> 06:35.875
with her grandson.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.542
Do you remember
the grandson's name?

06:37.625 --> 06:39.959
James.
Just a
teenager.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.125
Acted like
one, too.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.959
Always ridin'
around in his
car.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.959
James, was that you
honking that horn?

07:10.041 --> 07:11.667
- Yeah.
- Honk, honk, honk.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.959
- I'm sorry.
- Show some courtesy.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.041
I told you to be
waiting outside.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.917
You don't tell your
grandmother
to wait outside--

07:18.000 --> 07:19.125
I have a date.

07:19.208 --> 07:22.166
- And if we don't--
- Oh, hold your horses.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.291
I forgot my keys.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.834
I got keys.
Let's keep
moving.

07:25.917 --> 07:29.000
James, will you
stop rushing me?

07:29.083 --> 07:32.125
You know what?
I'm screwed now anyway.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.709
<i>(Joan)</i>
<i>Taking care of his grandma</i>
<i>put a real strain on James.</i>

07:39.959 --> 07:44.041
Anyway, poor old Krystal
eventually went missing.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.917
- When was this?
- '89, '90.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.208
Wandered off.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.709
The kid went
to the
police.

07:49.792 --> 07:53.375
Put flyers all around,
including one on my door.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.166
Used some kind of tape
that took off the paint.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.625
A body in our basement?

08:00.709 --> 08:01.917
It's a possibility.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.333
Outrageous.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.959
I told you that was weird.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.208
What was weird?

08:07.291 --> 08:09.041
This cat
from the moving company.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.875
What company?

08:10.959 --> 08:13.583
The other day they were moving
a family in down the block.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.333
One of the workers stops over,
says he grew up in this house.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.083
And he wants
to have a look around?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.000
You'd think he'd want to see
his old bedroom or something

08:20.083 --> 08:23.083
but this dude, he only
wants to see the basement.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.250
(Brad)
I basically live down here.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.709
Got my bar, my video games..

08:30.792 --> 08:32.333
...stereo..

08:32.417 --> 08:35.083
...various...whatnots.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.917
That's odd.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.250
What are these bricks about?

08:41.333 --> 08:43.208
(Brad)
'That's the old
coal chute.'

08:44.834 --> 08:46.375
You do this?

08:46.458 --> 08:47.709
No.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.834
Coroner says from the pelvis,
it's a female.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.458
And she has her teeth,
so we'll get an ID.

09:16.542 --> 09:17.583
What about her age?

09:17.667 --> 09:20.458
Sutures on the skull
are closed up.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.917
She was elderly.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.917
So your guy
was for
real.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.917
I just hopes
he calls back.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.250
Get that file
from missing persons?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.583
Krystal Hogan.
October '89.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.417
Yeah, the grandson,
James, filed the report.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.458
Did the investigators
do the job right?

09:43.542 --> 09:44.709
They put out an APB

09:44.792 --> 09:47.667
checked the morgues,
hospitals, jail system.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.000
Took statements,
from this James.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.333
Some others
didn't
tell you much.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.083
Says there were
no other relatives.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.375
They got dementia
written down question mark

09:54.458 --> 09:56.834
case was filed
pending more info.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.291
'But then, in '94'

09:58.375 --> 10:00.583
James petitioned the court
to declare grandma dead.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.834
That allowed him to collect

10:01.917 --> 10:04.083
on a $50,000 life
insurance policy.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.834
Well, it won't buy you
the 76ers

10:05.917 --> 10:07.750
but it does
give you motive.

10:07.834 --> 10:08.834
What about
the moving company?

10:08.917 --> 10:10.166
Does James work for one?

10:10.250 --> 10:11.458
Haven't made
that connect
yet.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.709
But we're thinking
he's the caller?

10:13.792 --> 10:15.709
Rush.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.667
Line two. It's him.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.709
- 'Anyway to trace this
boss?'
- We wish.

10:23.583 --> 10:24.542
Detective Rush.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.041
I don't like that you said that.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.250
Said what?

10:28.333 --> 10:30.041
That I just like
talking to police.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.208
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't have to.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.750
So, why are you doing this?

10:36.333 --> 10:40.250
Listen, James, I'm just
trying to do my job here.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.000
(Rush)
'You still there?'

10:52.083 --> 10:53.709
I'm here.

10:53.792 --> 10:56.250
Are you surprised
I know your name?

10:56.333 --> 10:59.500
Uh...I guess not.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.750
Look, did you find the body?

11:02.834 --> 11:04.166
'James, the best thing for you'

11:04.250 --> 11:06.041
is to come
into police headquarters.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.291
Just tell me, yes or no.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.625
[whispers]
DMV photo.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.083
'I know you found her.'

11:12.166 --> 11:14.291
'I mean, you had to have.'

11:16.125 --> 11:17.834
'Hello?'

11:17.917 --> 11:19.166
Uh, uh, I'm here.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.583
Um, uh..

11:21.667 --> 11:24.250
...I was thinking.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.458
Thinking what?

11:25.542 --> 11:26.959
'I understand
what you're doing.'

11:27.041 --> 11:28.417
I do that. I'll, uh..

11:28.500 --> 11:30.834
I'll be in a dark mood
and I'll..

11:30.917 --> 11:33.709
...turn to people
who I don't really know.

11:33.792 --> 11:34.792
'Seems safer.'

11:34.875 --> 11:36.041
I don't wanna talk.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.583
Well, hey,
it doesn't have to be me.

11:37.667 --> 11:41.083
Are you religious? I can
get you anybody you want.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.125
- 'James?'
- I'm here.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.917
Why'd you kill her?
She wasn't a good grandma?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.083
No, she was.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.834
You wanna tell me
how you did it?

11:51.834 --> 11:54.625
You're making my head hurt.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.750
James, how about we hang up?

12:01.834 --> 12:03.083
You wanna hang up?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.709
'Yeah, I'll give you
my cellphone number.'

12:04.792 --> 12:07.458
That way you can take a bunch
of
breaths, collect your thoughts

12:07.542 --> 12:09.792
and then we'll figure this out.

12:13.542 --> 12:14.792
James?

12:14.875 --> 12:15.834
'Yeah.'

12:15.917 --> 12:18.083
5-5-5..

12:18.166 --> 12:20.375
...0-1-9-8.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.208
Risky play.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.500
I was losing him.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.959
Give him my number,
maybe build a trust.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.709
What's our take on this guy?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.583
(Rush)
'Well, we know
he was orphaned.'

12:33.667 --> 12:35.041
Lost both parents
on the same night.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.166
And at 19,
he was solely responsible

12:37.250 --> 12:38.667
for an 81-year-old woman.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.667
- No other family?
- All alone in the world.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.750
Auto-track just spit out
his current address.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.125
We got him.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.250
Philadelphia police.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.792
(Vera)
'Police! Anyone here?'

13:03.250 --> 13:04.500
Clear.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.583
Guy didn't finish
his chicken potpie.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.917
We know he's in a hurry.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.500
He knew we were on to him.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.625
(Vera)
'You find something?'

13:21.709 --> 13:23.583
Something.

13:23.667 --> 13:27.041
"Listen, darling,
I don't mean to make you
tense.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.375
"I'm sorry.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.500
"I just want us
to move up in the world.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.875
Love you, Sherry."

13:33.959 --> 13:35.208
Sherry, who?

13:36.375 --> 13:37.542
"Fox."

13:37.625 --> 13:40.792
Postmark, February, 1989.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.375
You still reading your love
letters from 14 years ago?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.667
This guy's reliving
a better time

13:46.750 --> 13:49.208
'cause brotherly luv movers
is paying a slave wage.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.875
Guy's living alone,
got a bad job gettin' older.

13:51.959 --> 13:54.375
Self-esteem's shot, so he's
breakin' out old love
letters?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.041
Guilt over grandma's
gaining on him.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.417
But still, why does he crack
after 14 years?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.542
Why not 12 or 19?

14:00.625 --> 14:02.667
I'm gotta
call
Jeffries.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.375
Get him on the hunt
for this foxy lady.

14:05.458 --> 14:08.709
In the meantime, let's see if
brotherly luv has any for
James.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.417
Yeah, I had a job
over in Germantown

14:14.500 --> 14:16.083
three days ago.

14:16.166 --> 14:17.417
James Hogan was
on that crew?

14:17.500 --> 14:18.583
Yeah.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.125
Listen, that guy's
a hell of a worker.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.458
Shows up on time

14:21.542 --> 14:23.709
doesn't clown around,
dependable.

14:23.792 --> 14:24.792
So he's full-time?

14:24.875 --> 14:26.083
Yeah, and then some.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.333
Been with us
close to three years now.

14:28.417 --> 14:29.750
Why isn't he here today?

14:29.834 --> 14:31.208
This ain't union

14:31.291 --> 14:33.333
but a guy puts out,
I give him the days he wants.

14:33.417 --> 14:34.583
This was the first time
James asked

14:34.667 --> 14:36.959
'so I told him
to take the week.'

14:37.041 --> 14:39.458
He ever talk about
a girl named Sherry?

14:39.542 --> 14:41.667
- Beats me.
- Any girls at all?

14:41.750 --> 14:42.917
'Look, I don't know.'

14:43.000 --> 14:44.250
Some of the humps
around here

14:44.333 --> 14:46.000
give him a hard time
about that, but..

14:46.083 --> 14:48.291
...let's face it,
he's not George Clooney.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.834
Excuse me.

15:01.709 --> 15:02.792
Lilly Rush.

15:02.875 --> 15:05.917
I saw you at the apartment.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.959
'So you stuck around, huh?'

15:08.041 --> 15:09.166
You were watching?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.500
'Now there's a cop out front.'

15:10.583 --> 15:11.875
I can't get back in.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.792
'It's not just
your house, James.'

15:13.875 --> 15:15.792
There's an APB out on you.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.458
What'll happen to her body?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.875
What do you want to happen?

15:18.959 --> 15:20.583
I thought maybe

15:20.667 --> 15:22.083
a service of some kind

15:22.166 --> 15:24.667
and then bury her
at the county cemetery.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.875
- 'Don't think so.'
- Why not?

15:27.959 --> 15:30.125
I'm not trying
to upset you, but, uh..

15:30.208 --> 15:32.083
if next of kin
doesn't claim the body

15:32.166 --> 15:34.375
the coroner has procedures.

15:34.458 --> 15:35.500
Like what?

15:35.583 --> 15:37.583
Oh, he'll
cremate her then, uh..

15:37.667 --> 15:39.542
put her remains
in a plastic bag.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.375
Probably stamp on
a ticket number

15:41.458 --> 15:42.959
or some ID,
then box it up

15:43.041 --> 15:46.375
and stuff it away
in a warehouse somewhere.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.458
You wanna come in, James?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.542
Talk face to face?

15:54.625 --> 15:55.917
We can see about a real funeral

15:56.000 --> 15:57.542
for grandma that way.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.875
Do you really get dark moods

16:01.959 --> 16:03.709
or were you just conning me?

16:03.792 --> 16:06.125
Wish I was conning you.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.917
Look, you can talk to me.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.834
Don't you feel that?

16:10.917 --> 16:12.208
Yes.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.625
'So come in. We'll talk.'

16:15.709 --> 16:16.875
About what?

16:17.834 --> 16:20.750
How about...Sherry?

16:28.834 --> 16:30.875
Sore subject?

16:30.959 --> 16:32.250
Off-limits.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.834
Maybe because
she's no longer a fox.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.750
She goes
by Mrs. Stephens now.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.542
Lives on the main line.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.667
Nice digs.

16:45.750 --> 16:48.917
Marry an Ob-Gyn,
and you can have this, too.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.875
(Sherry)
This is a mistake.

17:00.959 --> 17:02.083
There was no homicide.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.583
James's grandma went missing.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.834
Well, it
ain't a
mistake.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.375
Have you seen
James recently?

17:08.458 --> 17:09.750
Talked to him?

17:09.834 --> 17:12.917
Not in three years.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.709
Still, this doesn't make sense.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.667
But you two were
involved, right?

17:17.750 --> 17:18.875
Well, he was my boyfriend.

17:18.959 --> 17:21.125
We lived together forever.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.875
You break up with him?

17:23.959 --> 17:25.709
We met at a bowling alley.

17:25.792 --> 17:29.125
And at the time that kind of
life was really fun to me.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.333
Ten years later, it wasn't.

17:32.417 --> 17:34.667
How long till you got married?

17:34.750 --> 17:37.458
- A year.
- That's pretty quick.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.709
Doesn't seem so quick
when you're over 30.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.417
Sherry, going back,
were you around

17:43.500 --> 17:46.125
when Krystal
supposedly went missing?

17:46.208 --> 17:48.291
Not the exact day.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.542
But I was staying over a lot.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.875
What was that like?

17:50.959 --> 17:53.625
- How do you mean?
- Before Krystal's gone.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.125
Sleeping over with
grandma in the house?

17:57.417 --> 17:59.125
Mostly okay.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.875
But sometimes not.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.792
Let's go upstairs.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.417
No, it'll be better here.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.583
What if Krystal comes in?

18:11.667 --> 18:12.917
Let her.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.125
No, come on.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.792
What?

18:22.875 --> 18:24.458
Times change, grandma.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.000
'Gotta accept
that things ain't like'

18:26.083 --> 18:28.291
when you were a kid.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.917
I just came to give you
a check for groceries.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.792
You don't like
it here, grandma?

18:38.458 --> 18:40.834
I can make
other arrangements for you.

18:40.917 --> 18:44.333
But James threatened to put her
in a home, not murder her.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.208
Now, Krystal was
chippin'
in on the bills, right?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.542
(Sherry)
'I think she didn't
mind helping out'

18:47.625 --> 18:49.250
when James got in a pinch.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.458
Well, please tell me
he's not in trouble.

18:55.542 --> 18:56.542
Wish I could.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.917
'Thanks for your time.'

18:59.166 --> 19:00.625
(Vera)
'So, she outgrew the guy.'

19:00.709 --> 19:03.375
He's still pining for her
all these years later.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.709
Most people get
over this stuff.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.458
She left him
three years ago

19:07.542 --> 19:09.125
grandma died 14 years ago

19:09.208 --> 19:11.792
but I still don't get
why he's reaching out today.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.375
- Where you headed?
- Due in court.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.166
Drop by social
security for me?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.542
Uh, not my favorite joint.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.709
What do you need?

19:22.792 --> 19:24.083
Well, it took five years

19:24.166 --> 19:26.083
before the court
declared
Krystal Hogan dead

19:26.166 --> 19:29.083
and six years before
James
collected the life
insurance.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.208
So, in the meantime

19:30.291 --> 19:31.417
you think he was picking up

19:31.500 --> 19:32.458
her benefit checks?

19:32.542 --> 19:34.250
Easy scam to pull off.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.917
Sherry said grandma had
some cash floating around.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.583
So, what about Krystal's
bank records?

19:38.667 --> 19:39.959
Already put out a subpoena.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.542
Alright.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.709
- Rush.
- Yeah?

19:43.792 --> 19:46.750
Remember when I ran James
through NCIC, PCIC?

19:46.834 --> 19:48.041
Yeah, he was clean.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.959
Yeah, well, I got his
social, I ran him again.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.792
He got an assault charge.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.333
Why didn't it
show up earlier?

19:53.417 --> 19:55.000
He wasn't charged under
the name James Hogan.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.709
He was charged under
the name James Gable.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.500
- Gable?
- Half-brother to the
victim.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.625
Lonnie Gable.

20:00.709 --> 20:02.417
So he has some family
after all.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.625
I don't know if
Lonnie's
gonna see it that
way.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.291
What did James do to him?

20:06.375 --> 20:08.625
Beat on him...with a brick.

20:15.375 --> 20:17.125
(Rush)
'James was using
your last name?'

20:17.208 --> 20:19.792
'Cause I bought him
his first car.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.208
I told him not to do that.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.291
Sounds like
you looked out for him.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.125
He's my little brother.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.458
So, how did he
end up alone with Krystal?

20:27.542 --> 20:28.625
I was in Baltimore

20:28.709 --> 20:30.291
working for a mortgage company.

20:30.375 --> 20:33.458
When mom died in that wreck,
I came back.

20:33.542 --> 20:35.458
I didn't wanna move in.

20:35.542 --> 20:38.959
I've got a life. But I told
him
to get live-in help for her.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.667
- He didn't wanna do that?
- I couldn't force him.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.667
She was his grandma, not mine.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.875
Actually, he
and the old girl

20:44.959 --> 20:46.959
got along pretty good.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.125
He always said how much
he liked his talks with her.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.333
I lived
nearby,
I figured

20:51.417 --> 20:53.000
I could look
over his
shoulder.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.083
But then you two
had that falling
out.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.166
He was begging for me
to meet Sherry.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.333
You weren't too high on her?

20:59.417 --> 21:01.208
I had 'em over
for a barbecue.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.500
She's nice, whatever.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.500
Then suddenly
she says that she wants

21:04.583 --> 21:06.500
this certain wine cooler

21:06.583 --> 21:07.917
so James goes on a run.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.458
For the next 20 minutes

21:09.542 --> 21:11.500
this girl goes on parade.

21:11.583 --> 21:14.166
Flirting, prancing,
bendin' over

21:14.250 --> 21:17.250
real intentional,
showing me the world.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.041
'I just look away,
whatever.'

21:19.125 --> 21:20.667
And then she says

21:20.750 --> 21:23.041
will I take her away
to New York?

21:23.125 --> 21:26.125
It was such a sideways
thing to say, I just
laugh.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.166
And she follows it up with

21:28.250 --> 21:29.834
"Whatever you want

21:29.917 --> 21:33.583
wherever you want,
for the rest of your life."

21:34.667 --> 21:35.834
So, then what happened?

21:35.917 --> 21:37.792
I got her the hell
out of my yard.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.709
'James comes back
I figure I better tell him'

21:39.792 --> 21:41.208
'before she
starts lying.'

21:41.291 --> 21:44.542
So we sit on this back
stoop that I'm fixin' up.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.041
You can guess the rest.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.625
(Vera)
'Oh, he opened you up
pretty good.'

21:47.709 --> 21:49.875
So, why did you pull back
on pressing charges?

21:49.959 --> 21:51.709
What, am I gonna
send him to jail?

21:51.792 --> 21:55.709
I figure it's best just
to walk away and not look
back.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.583
The shocking thing was

21:57.667 --> 21:59.291
he was really fond of Krystal.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.542
Krystal's benefit checks
were $812 dollars a
month.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.917
Good bank for a 19-year-old.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.542
And they flowed in
long after her
death.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.208
These here are
dated
before the murder.

22:12.291 --> 22:13.750
That's Krystal's signature.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.291
The rest are
dated
after she died.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.583
I know that writing.

22:23.166 --> 22:25.709
See the little tails
on both S's?

22:25.792 --> 22:26.667
Mm-hmm.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.875
Did Sherry endorse these checks?

22:28.959 --> 22:31.375
Well, let me send it
over to Questioned
Documents.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.583
- Thanks.
- Alright.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.917
What if Sherry
orchestrated
this?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.875
The fraud or the murder?

22:37.959 --> 22:38.875
Or both.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.083
So, you're saying

22:40.166 --> 22:41.625
Lonnie's story
is starting to ring true?

22:41.709 --> 22:43.333
Well, these checks
showed she was no angel

22:43.417 --> 22:46.834
and if James got on so well
with
grandma the way Lonnie says..

22:46.917 --> 22:48.500
Hmm, plus your crush on him.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.500
James just got sloppy.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.834
See if you can ID this.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.208
Two-four-two-seven,
Two-four-two-seven.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.250
- Hello.
- What did Sherry say to you?

23:02.333 --> 23:04.709
You're gonna follow me, James,
you might as well just come in.

23:04.792 --> 23:05.959
Tell me.

23:06.041 --> 23:07.250
Cops get information,
they don't give it.

23:07.333 --> 23:08.792
'I wasn't following you.'

23:08.875 --> 23:11.041
You asked about Sherry,
so I knew you'd go see her.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.291
But you were there.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.417
I was around.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.625
You around Sherry's house a lot?

23:16.709 --> 23:18.000
Do not accuse me of that.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.625
I know what you're
accusing me of.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.625
Then help me understand, James.

23:21.709 --> 23:23.041
'I'm not a stalker.'

23:23.125 --> 23:24.959
That was the first time
I've ever gone by.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.625
Only once in three years?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.166
I've been doing
what you're supposed to.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.333
I'm working.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.709
I haven't been in trouble.
You can check.

23:32.792 --> 23:34.583
I did.

23:34.667 --> 23:36.583
- It's true.
- Okay, then.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.458
So, why are you flipping out
today, James?

23:39.542 --> 23:41.500
What happened
to make it today?

23:41.583 --> 23:43.166
I don't wanna tell you that.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.500
Everything she used to give me

23:48.583 --> 23:49.834
I don't have anymore.

23:49.917 --> 23:52.125
But that's not new.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.166
That's a three-year-old problem.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.083
Tell me what she said. Please.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.500
She was trying to protect you.

24:01.583 --> 24:02.667
She was?

24:02.750 --> 24:04.417
She said
she didn't think you did it.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.000
Really?

24:07.083 --> 24:10.500
I'm wondering if she was
trying
to fake me out.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.375
If maybe she was...part of it.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.250
No. No.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.875
I've been finding out
a lot of things.

24:17.959 --> 24:19.041
What things?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.333
I know
she signed Krystal's checks.

24:21.417 --> 24:23.500
- 'That's forgery.'
- No, that was me.

24:23.583 --> 24:24.667
Looked like her handwriting.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.041
And according to your brother

24:26.125 --> 24:27.959
Sherry isn't as reputable

24:28.041 --> 24:29.083
as she plays up to be.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.750
Son of a bitch!

24:30.834 --> 24:31.834
He's a liar.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.959
'You're saying she never knew?'

24:34.041 --> 24:35.458
Never talked about how great

24:35.542 --> 24:38.250
it would be to collect
grandma's money?

24:38.333 --> 24:40.125
'Just got cash from you'

24:40.208 --> 24:41.959
'never asked
where it came from?'

24:43.458 --> 24:44.959
She'd say things.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.417
Okay.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.583
But Sherry says things
she doesn't mean.

24:58.417 --> 25:00.792
- Don't move.
- Why?

25:00.875 --> 25:02.583
The way the light's hitting.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.166
You're my handsome man.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.792
Don't say that.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.542
No one's better
on the inside, hear me?

25:08.625 --> 25:10.709
I see the way
you take care of your grandma.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.875
Sometimes I'm not sure
I'm living up, you know?

25:14.959 --> 25:17.375
You see how she watches
the preachers all day?

25:17.458 --> 25:19.917
All she wants is peace.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.542
I do sort of feel that.

25:21.625 --> 25:24.417
It's no accident she waits
for you to open her mail.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.208
Always letting you
know that money's come.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.250
The same joke every time.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.333
"What good's money
to a worn-out bag of
bones?"

25:32.417 --> 25:35.417
She's not gonna come
right out and say it.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.625
You got to read
between the lines, darlin'.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.959
I don't think
I could ever do
that.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.083
Of course you couldn't.

25:50.041 --> 25:52.792
See, with her it was just talk.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.291
She manipulated you, James.

25:55.375 --> 25:56.917
You need to see that.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.667
He's at the bus station.

26:24.333 --> 26:28.166
- Hello?
- 'You've been conning me.'

26:28.250 --> 26:29.166
What?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.583
- 'Yeah, I can tell.'
- No.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.250
I can see it on your face.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.417
Police! Don't move!

26:48.500 --> 26:49.542
'Rush!'

26:52.959 --> 26:54.125
It's not him.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.250
James kills grandma for Sherry

27:00.333 --> 27:02.875
so he can afford to take
her
nicer places than
bowling.

27:02.959 --> 27:04.750
And make her
the new lady of the house.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.375
Or Sherry put him up to it.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.792
Or does the deed herself.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.709
Those are the scenarios.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.041
Do we know how grandma died?

27:12.125 --> 27:13.417
Autopsy made a positive ID.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.875
No cause of death determined.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.000
Heard from James lately?

27:17.083 --> 27:18.458
No. He's pissed at me

27:18.542 --> 27:20.583
'cause I bad-mouthed Sherry.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.750
Hope I didn't take it too far.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.041
It's been hours.

27:24.125 --> 27:25.583
You're gonna love this.

27:25.667 --> 27:26.875
Sherry had four sets of parents

27:26.959 --> 27:29.291
all before she was
11 years old.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.291
- Foster homes.
- 'Yeah, then a runaway.'

27:31.375 --> 27:32.583
On the streets
and who knows what

27:32.667 --> 27:33.917
till she meets James.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.208
- 'Any record?'
- Shoplifting.

27:36.291 --> 27:37.959
Well, she's a survivor.

27:38.041 --> 27:40.458
She finds James,
a 19-year-old with a house.

27:40.542 --> 27:41.542
Moves up to a doctor

27:41.625 --> 27:42.875
on the Main Line.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.542
(Jeffries)
'Aw, sooki-sooki.'

27:46.333 --> 27:48.125
Where you going?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.333
Pharmacy run.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.291
Thought your sister
was taking care of your
mother.

27:54.250 --> 27:55.667
AWOL since last week.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.125
Detective.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.000
Lonnie. What happened?

28:01.083 --> 28:03.333
I was going to my car,
and James jumps me.

28:03.417 --> 28:05.917
Keeps going on and on
about Sherry and her pure heart

28:06.000 --> 28:08.166
what a lout I am,
all the old stuff.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.041
I'm sorry.
You can press
charges.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.500
No, that's not what I want.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.125
But I didn't lay down.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.709
Me and him, we had it out.

28:14.792 --> 28:15.917
And we talked, too.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.875
- You talked?
- About him coming in.

28:17.959 --> 28:20.041
I'm not gonna walk away again.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.166
But I want him brought in safe.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.375
I'm working hard to do that.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.583
No. I mean I've set it up.

28:26.667 --> 28:27.750
He's agreed to meet.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.458
But only with you.

28:56.709 --> 28:58.625
(James)
'Lonnie okay?'

28:58.709 --> 29:00.500
Fair.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.208
I'm such a jerk.

29:02.291 --> 29:04.041
I shouldn't have hurt him.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.792
You got
to control yourself, James.

29:05.875 --> 29:09.125
I don't know why he keeps
telling that lie about Sherry.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.041
What's the plan now, James?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.291
I wanna turn myself in.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.583
- Good.
- One condition.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.166
I'm listening.

29:26.250 --> 29:29.208
You guarantee me
you'll leave Sherry alone.

29:29.291 --> 29:30.500
She's not part of this.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.000
If that's true,
you have your
guarantee.

29:33.083 --> 29:37.083
No! Certain things
will look bad for her.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.500
You're already thinking
that way.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.875
James, every cop in
Philly
has an eye out.

29:40.959 --> 29:42.083
Some are inexperienced.

29:42.166 --> 29:43.792
Don't let this end badly.

29:43.875 --> 29:46.000
Right now, we go in safe.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.417
This was a bad idea.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.542
You ever ask her to marry you?

29:56.125 --> 29:58.375
- What?
- You were together a long
time.

29:59.458 --> 30:02.125
You ask her to wear your ring?

30:02.208 --> 30:03.208
Yes.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.542
She said no, huh?

30:04.625 --> 30:06.041
She had her reasons.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.166
Whatever they were

30:07.250 --> 30:08.875
she quit you.

30:08.959 --> 30:10.000
So, why protect her now?

30:10.083 --> 30:11.041
I know what you're doing.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.583
You're trying to tear her down.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.750
I just don't think Lonnie
was lying about her, James.

30:15.834 --> 30:17.083
She was my girl.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.083
She believed in me.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.875
'And that may not be big to you'

30:21.959 --> 30:24.875
but it is to me. And not
just when we were together.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.959
More so since we've been apart.

30:28.041 --> 30:29.291
How's that work?

30:29.375 --> 30:32.375
She told me that
for the rest of her life

30:32.458 --> 30:35.583
she would never find someone
who took care of her like I
did.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.500
That that's the man I am.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.333
Even now,
I know she believes in me.

30:41.417 --> 30:43.750
So why do you believe in her?

30:43.834 --> 30:46.333
- She's gone.
- What do you know about it?

30:46.417 --> 30:48.583
I know Lonnie wasn't lying
that day you hit him

30:48.667 --> 30:50.166
with the brick.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.417
And so do you.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.333
She didn't love you, James.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.375
And I'm your girl now.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.417
She's one powerful girl.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.625
James is still hanging on to
what she said at the kiss-off.

31:22.709 --> 31:24.417
While she's kicking
back on the Main
Line

31:24.500 --> 31:25.750
with Dr. Stephens.

31:25.834 --> 31:28.125
Oh, I have some new,
interesting information

31:28.208 --> 31:30.542
about Sherry and doctors.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.625
Care for a coke, coffee?

31:35.709 --> 31:37.709
I'm good, thanks.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.125
Husband bring you in?

31:39.208 --> 31:42.458
Yeah, he doesn't
like
me driving in the
city.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.125
How'd you meet your husband?

31:44.208 --> 31:45.333
He was my doctor.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.458
Hmm.

31:47.875 --> 31:50.125
- 'Out in Merion?'
- Yeah.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.375
Forty-five minutes away
from where you and James lived.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.125
So?

31:55.208 --> 31:57.875
I noticed your dentist,
dermatologist

31:57.959 --> 32:00.792
all your health care
takes place out in the
suburbs.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.166
I live in the suburbs.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.625
Well, now you do.

32:03.709 --> 32:05.041
But you started
with all these doctors

32:05.125 --> 32:07.667
while you
were still in Germantown.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.834
All your doctors are male,
aren't they?

32:09.917 --> 32:11.166
I don't get your meaning.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.166
Nothing, no meaning.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.125
(Vera)
'Here's what bugs me.'

32:16.208 --> 32:18.709
You and Jimmy together,
I ain't seeing it.

32:18.792 --> 32:22.500
I mean...you're a head turner.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.166
Him...he's a shlub.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.333
And that's not a shot.

32:25.417 --> 32:27.166
I mean, you're out
of my league, too. But..

32:27.250 --> 32:29.667
How a man looks
has never mattered to
me.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.500
Lonnie's pretty good-looking.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.959
Not with that scar, he isn't.

32:34.041 --> 32:36.750
No remorse for
having caused that scar?

32:36.834 --> 32:38.959
- "Caused?"
- We've been talking to
Lonnie.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.917
He gave us
the whole shooting match, babe.

32:41.041 --> 32:43.083
Well, the next
time
you see Lonnie

32:43.166 --> 32:44.875
tell him to
have another
drink.

32:47.583 --> 32:50.166
Recognize this?

32:50.250 --> 32:53.375
I guess, it looks
like a letter I
wrote.

32:53.458 --> 32:55.583
You talk about being tense.

32:55.667 --> 32:57.000
- Over what?
- Who knows?

32:57.083 --> 32:59.917
That was 14 years ago.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.667
"Let's move up in the world."

33:01.750 --> 33:03.750
- Anything on that?
- I have goals.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.625
Let's try and...do well.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.875
A driven person,
aren't you, Sherry?

33:09.959 --> 33:11.875
'Sure, no question.'

33:11.959 --> 33:13.625
Coming up hard the way you did

33:13.709 --> 33:14.917
you'd have to be, right?

33:16.166 --> 33:17.375
What would you know about it?

33:17.458 --> 33:21.583
Nothing. I came up
in a real sound situation.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.625
(Vera)
'Not like you.'

33:23.709 --> 33:25.375
You had it hardscrabble.

33:25.458 --> 33:28.000
You had to fight your way
to the Main Line.

33:28.083 --> 33:32.250
Did you ask James to get rid
of his grandma in this
letter?

33:32.333 --> 33:33.208
No.

33:33.291 --> 33:34.250
What did you mean by asking him

33:34.333 --> 33:35.333
to read between the lines?

33:35.417 --> 33:36.917
That all grandma
wanted was peace?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.417
N-nothing. I-I don't
even
remember saying that.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.875
You must have loved sharing
a bathroom with an
81-year-old.

33:42.959 --> 33:45.125
I-I liked Krystal.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.083
But she was old.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.208
Already lived a full life.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.500
(Vera)
'She'd had her time.'

33:49.583 --> 33:52.166
Now it was your time, right?

33:52.250 --> 33:53.500
Before I was a cop, Sherry

33:53.583 --> 33:55.667
I worked
in Questioned Documents.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.792
Handwriting Specialist.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.166
Board certified.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.166
So?

34:01.250 --> 34:03.750
So, this isn't
Krystal's signature.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.083
This is you
signing Krystal's name.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.041
You-you're wrong.

34:11.125 --> 34:13.333
Board certified, Sherry.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.000
Did you get her to go?

34:23.083 --> 34:24.625
- For the fraud.
- Won't go for the murder.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.208
Rush.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.667
(James)
'I'm calling to say
goodbye.'

34:37.375 --> 34:38.625
It was messed up,
I open the door

34:38.709 --> 34:40.542
and it's that James dude
from the other day.

34:40.625 --> 34:41.792
And he was armed?

34:41.875 --> 34:43.291
Had the double-barrel
all busted out.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.458
Told us to leave.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.166
Guy took the
place.
That was it.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.417
- I've gotta get inside.
- Well, SWAT wants to wait,
Lil.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.834
We can't wait.

34:58.709 --> 34:59.917
You gotta go to bat for me.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.125
(Lilly)
'James.'

35:13.000 --> 35:14.083
Can you hear me?

35:15.166 --> 35:16.375
(James)
'I hear you.'

35:18.083 --> 35:19.125
'Hey..'

35:21.125 --> 35:23.000
I wanna come around
this corner..

35:23.917 --> 35:25.125
...but I know you have a gun.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.583
I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.542
I believe you.

35:29.625 --> 35:32.250
But you need
to put the gun down.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.917
I'm gonna show
you my gun, okay?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.333
Then you show yours.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.166
James?

35:39.250 --> 35:42.166
Just don't ask me
to give it to you.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.250
Deal.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.417
Say it again, will you?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.917
Say what again?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.208
My name.
You always say my name.

36:11.333 --> 36:12.375
James.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.667
Sherry would never call me that.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.542
No?

36:20.625 --> 36:21.709
'What, then?'

36:22.875 --> 36:25.750
Hon...or baby..

36:27.000 --> 36:30.250
Or darlin', mostly.
Darlin'.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.667
That's nice.

36:32.750 --> 36:35.333
No, but, sometimes
you
wanna hear your name

36:35.417 --> 36:38.875
you know, and she
would never say
it.

36:38.959 --> 36:42.417
I'd ask, but she said
it made her feel awkward.

36:44.333 --> 36:47.875
Who I am made her feel awkward..

36:51.041 --> 36:53.125
Should've known
back then, right?

36:53.208 --> 36:54.542
No. She's..

36:58.000 --> 37:00.083
...good, James.

37:02.625 --> 37:04.709
Clever.

37:04.792 --> 37:06.208
I feel like I
can
really talk to
you.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.500
Keep that gun down.

37:17.208 --> 37:18.875
Do you like talking to me?

37:23.041 --> 37:24.083
Yeah.

37:25.542 --> 37:26.583
I do.

37:28.458 --> 37:29.709
I did a bad thing.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.542
- Do you want more?
- Hmm.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.500
There's no shame
in scrubbing floors.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.959
- If only my knees knew it.
- Lemme help.

37:45.041 --> 37:46.500
Oh, thank you.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.291
You know, I used to
run
like the wind.

37:51.375 --> 37:52.542
Did you know that?

37:54.625 --> 37:55.792
Look at me now.

37:58.166 --> 37:59.583
Are you sad, Grandma?

38:01.417 --> 38:02.959
Of course I'm sad.

38:03.041 --> 38:06.959
But this is the way
it's supposed to be.

38:07.041 --> 38:11.041
We're meant
to wear ourselves out, James.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.917
That's what the Lord expects.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.417
Here, lift your head.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.208
Lay back.

38:22.458 --> 38:23.500
Oh.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.417
Close your eyes.

38:36.291 --> 38:38.125
Finish.

38:38.208 --> 38:39.375
Huh?

38:39.458 --> 38:41.542
You have to finish telling.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.250
You have to face it.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.166
Here, lift your head.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.333
It's for the best.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.166
You didn't kill her.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.625
Sherry did.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.375
No, it's still the same.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.333
I put her in the basement.

39:39.709 --> 39:41.166
'I dumped her here..'

39:42.667 --> 39:43.875
...like potatoes.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.041
It's the same.

39:48.959 --> 39:50.000
Worse..

39:52.375 --> 39:53.959
...for you.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.166
In your mind, it's worse.

39:59.041 --> 40:00.834
Because you let it happen.

40:02.041 --> 40:03.750
That's what's eaten you

40:03.834 --> 40:04.959
what you didn't do.

40:05.041 --> 40:08.291
My God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

40:08.375 --> 40:09.375
- Don't!
- This is it.

40:09.458 --> 40:10.500
Suicide's not the way, James.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.417
I'm executing myself.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.458
I deserve to die for what I did.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.500
Look at me.

40:16.583 --> 40:18.667
'James.'

40:18.750 --> 40:21.000
'Why'd you start this?'

40:21.083 --> 40:23.166
Sherry left you,
and for three years

40:23.250 --> 40:26.208
no trouble, so why'd you call?

40:26.291 --> 40:28.500
I wasn't getting over things

40:28.583 --> 40:30.375
the way you're supposed to.

40:32.959 --> 40:35.250
You couldn't move on.

40:35.333 --> 40:40.375
And it was just...the
final straw last week.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.750
What was?

40:46.875 --> 40:48.166
James..

40:48.250 --> 40:49.583
...give me an answer.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.959
Give me an answer!

41:00.709 --> 41:03.375
'I was working down the road..'

41:03.458 --> 41:04.583
With the movers.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.333
...and I-I was,
like, three doors down

41:07.417 --> 41:09.750
so I figured,
lemme come pay my respects.

41:10.792 --> 41:12.500
And the kid you know..

41:12.583 --> 41:15.542
he lets me come down
here and-and look.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.291
- Look?
- Look at this place.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.875
It's a party place.

41:20.250 --> 41:21.709
And, the kid was telling
me all the things

41:21.792 --> 41:23.166
they do down here

41:23.250 --> 41:25.250
and my grandma's
underneath them the whole time.

41:25.333 --> 41:28.417
Under this cheesy bar.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.125
And I put her there!

41:32.166 --> 41:35.291
And I looked
in this beer mirror..

41:37.291 --> 41:40.000
and I thought, I am a disgrace.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.792
I'm a disgrace.

41:56.875 --> 41:57.917
James..

42:00.250 --> 42:01.917
You're not a disgrace.

42:03.917 --> 42:05.250
You have regret.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.667
You're facing that night.

42:09.750 --> 42:12.125
Who says that counts
for anything?

42:13.625 --> 42:15.083
That's up to you..

42:17.417 --> 42:18.959
...but it counts for me.
