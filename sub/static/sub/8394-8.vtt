I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
THERE HAD TO BE A THIS TIME.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.876
THIS WAS, LIKE,
TH REE YEARS AGO.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.776
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT THEY DID.

06:48.890 --> 06:49.811
HE CALLED HIM A RETARD.
I PUNCHED HIM.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.535
IT'S NOT LIKE I
PUT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.709

AND YOU TELLING ME
ABOUT STREAKING

06:59.690 --> 07:01.305
AT A MOTHER-DAUGHTER BANQUET
AND YOU WERE NAKED.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.480
GLAD YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.137
- WHERE?

07:11.770 --> 07:12.759
WE'RE DOWN TO THE WIRE.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.448
HE CAN TURN
THIS TWO POINT LEAD

07:13.570 --> 07:15.253
INTO A FIVE POINT LEAD.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.634
WE'LL BE COOKED
WHEN HE DOES THAT.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.082
- [sighs]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.499
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.464
- I DON'T EITHER.
- I TOLD HIM.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.389
- WHAT?
- I--YEARS AGO.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.501
I TOLD HIM
WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR HIM.

07:26.610 --> 07:29.124
HE THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME
AND THAT YOU WERE THE MAN

07:29.240 --> 07:29.433
AND IT WAS SO COOL
AND GREAT.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.404
I'M SORRY.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.919
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT LITTLE BASTARD

07:33.030 --> 07:35.032
REMEMBERED THIS
AND TRIED TO USE IT AGAINST YOU.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.415
- YES, I GET IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.556
LET'S CALL A PRESS CONFERENCE.
- NO, NO.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.072
WE DON'T NEED TO GIVE THIS
MORE PLAY.

07:42.180 --> 07:44.216
WE NEED TO GO NEGATIVE.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.108
WE NEED TO FIND SOME STORY
ABOUT MISTER SQUEAKY CLEAN

07:48.220 --> 07:49.630
MR. LITTLE AND LEAK THAT OUT.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.469
- OH, HE'S NOT SQUEAKY CLEAN.
- I KNOW HE'S NOT.

07:51.570 --> 07:52.878
I'M TIRED OF THAT IMAGE
ANYWAY.

07:52.980 --> 07:55.744
- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
WE COULD DIG UP ON HIM.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.841
- YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
ANYTHING YOU FOUND OUT...

07:57.960 --> 08:00.645
WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING HIS
CAMPAIGN, ANYTHING COME UP?

08:00.750 --> 08:03.264
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.
I'M GONNA FIND IT.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.548
- I LOVE YOU.
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

08:07.650 --> 08:09.891
- OKAY. I'M TIRED.
- YEAH?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.514
- YEAH, WE JUST STARTED
RECORDING A NEW TRACK

08:12.630 --> 08:13.244
AND I'M JUST, LIKE...
I DON'T KNOW.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.511
I FEEL REALLY DRAINED.

08:15.630 --> 08:18.383
- ANYBODY NOTICE ANYTHING,
UH, DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU?

08:18.490 --> 08:19.457
- [laughs]

08:19.560 --> 08:22.074
YES, OF COURSE.
- WHAT'D THEY SAY?

08:22.190 --> 08:24.078
- HOW COULD THEY NOT?
- DID THEY FREAK OUT?

08:24.190 --> 08:27.318
- THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
YEAH, THEY--

08:27.430 --> 08:29.489
- WERE THEY EXCITED?
- VERY EXCITED.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.123
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING.

08:31.230 --> 08:34.267
YEAH, CROSBY SAID, YOU KNOW,
"DON'T SHOW JASMINE THAT

08:34.370 --> 08:37.021
OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO UPGRADE
AND GET HER ONE OF THOSE.

08:37.130 --> 08:37.926
- WELL, TOO BAD.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.611
IT'S ONE OF A KIND,
SO SHE CAN'T...

08:39.720 --> 08:42.655
- THIS?
- SHE CAN'T--YEAH.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.159
- WOW.
- LOOK AT THAT.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.611
ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.145
- I DON'T EVEN--
I CAN'T EVEN PROCESS IT.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.138
- IT'S JUST--
IT LOOKS SO PERFECT ON YOU.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.694
IT'S CRAZY.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.244
DO YOU LIKE IT?

08:55.360 --> 08:56.247
- IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.769
- I'M GONNA MAKE US DINNER.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.916
- OKAY.
THANKS, THEN.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.789
- DAD?
- YUP.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.164
- OH.

09:12.270 --> 09:13.339
COME ON IN.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.159
OH, YEAH.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.306
- WHAT ARE YOU--
- MM.

09:18.410 --> 09:19.445
MAN, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO THAT.

09:19.550 --> 09:20.960
- REALLY?

09:21.070 --> 09:21.650
- I'M EXPERIMENTING
WITH DIFFERENT FOOD GROUPS.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.627
VERY GOOD.
- WHAT IS IT?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.290
- IT'S CEREAL WITH WHIPPED CREAM
AND A BANANA.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.733
- DAD.
- WHAT?

09:29.840 --> 09:30.454
- IS THIS THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN EATING?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.879
- UH, KIND OF, YEAH.

09:32.980 --> 09:33.708
WHY DO THE KIDS KEEP
STOPPING BY HERE

09:33.810 --> 09:35.664
AND THEN, LIKE, CHECKING ON ME?

09:35.780 --> 09:37.111
YOU DON'T NEED TO CHECK ON ME.

09:37.230 --> 09:38.845
I'M GONNA BE FINE.
- WELL, DAD, I DON'T KNOW.

09:38.950 --> 09:40.531
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR OWN

09:40.640 --> 09:42.221
AND, YOU KNOW, SO I WAS NEXT
IN THE ROTATION..

09:42.340 --> 09:43.432
- WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR OWN.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.508
DO THE KIDS KEEP CHECKING UP
ON YOU?

09:45.610 --> 09:46.998
DO PEOPLE STOP BY?
- NO, DAD.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.715
AND THEY DON'T BRING ME
WHAT'S IN THIS BAG EITHER,

09:48.820 --> 09:50.754
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST GO--
- NO, NO, NO.

09:50.860 --> 09:52.134
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD IT.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.231
- HM?
- GET BACK HERE.

09:54.350 --> 09:56.272
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

09:56.380 --> 09:57.620
- DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
- UH-HUH.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.176
- WELL, THE POTATO SALAD
IS IN THE BAG

10:00.280 --> 10:01.759
THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

10:01.870 --> 10:03.519
WHICH IS WHY I CAME
FROM SAN FRANCISCO

10:03.630 --> 10:06.281
TO GIVE IT TO YOU,
NOT TO MENTION...

10:06.390 --> 10:07.664
- OOH.
- YEAH.

10:07.770 --> 10:09.909
THE RIBS THAT ARE HOT,
HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.045
- OH, LET ME SMELL THEM.
LET ME SMELL.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.229
MM.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.536
- AND BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,
I GOT YOU EXTRA SAUCE.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.505
- OH, THE EXTRA SAUCE.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.645
LET'S EAT IT NOW,
SHALL WE?

10:17.750 --> 10:18.785
- OKAY, YEAH.

10:18.890 --> 10:21.643
- I WANT TO TRY THIS THOUGH.
- OH, EASY.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.956
- EW.

10:23.070 --> 10:25.334
- SO, HEY, HOW WAS BALLET CLASS
THE OTHER DAY?

10:25.450 --> 10:26.519
- UM, IT WAS GOOD.
- IT WAS?

10:26.620 --> 10:29.509
- YEAH, IT WAS ACTUALLY
REALLY GOOD.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.655
- OH, IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- YEAH.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.933
- WHAT'S THE THING
YOU LIKE BEST ABOUT IT?

10:33.040 --> 10:35.759
- I LIKE WHEN WE DROP
THE BABY OFF AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE.

10:35.870 --> 10:36.723
- YEAH, SHE'S NOT MUCH
OF A DANCER.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.070
SHE'S MORE
OF A DROOLER REALLY, HUH?

10:39.190 --> 10:41.385
- YEAH.
- WHAT ELSE YOU LIKE ABOUT IT?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.706
OOH!

10:42.810 --> 10:44.869
- MOM AND I GET TO HAVE
BURGER AND PIE AFTER.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.538
SHE LETS ME ORDER
WHATEVER I WANT

10:46.640 --> 10:48.460
BECAUSE BALLET'S
SUCH A GOOD EXERCISE.

10:48.570 --> 10:50.265
- MM.

10:50.370 --> 10:51.462
YEAH, I'D EVEN DO BALLET
FOR BURGER AND PIE.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.605
- YOU HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.982
- OH, OKAY.
- THERE YOU GO.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.988
- YOU KNOW, BUDDY,
IF YOU'RE JUST DOING BALLET

10:57.100 --> 10:59.261
SO YOU CAN SPEND TIME WITH MOM
AND EAT AT BURGER AND PIE

10:59.380 --> 11:00.654
I WON'T TELL HER.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.409
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST CURIOUS
IF THAT'S...

11:02.520 --> 11:05.171
- NO, DAD.
I REALLY LIKE BALLET.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.963
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.413
ACTUALLY, I THINK I LOVE IT.

11:10.530 --> 11:12.282
BOOM!
- YOU LOVE IT?

11:12.390 --> 11:13.425
- DO YOUR--DO, LIKE, A PLIE.

11:13.530 --> 11:16.567
DO YOUR--

11:16.670 --> 11:18.217
- YEAH, LIKE THIS.

11:18.330 --> 11:18.773
HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP?

11:18.880 --> 11:20.848
I GOT YOU.
OH, LOWER.

11:20.950 --> 11:21.530
MOVE YOUR CENTER OF GRAVITY.
- YEAH.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.983
- I TOLD YOU IT'S PERFECT.

11:24.090 --> 11:26.365
- THIS IS--YEAH,
THEY'RE REALLY COMING ALONG.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.506
INCREDIBLE WITH THAT FERTILIZER.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.477
- EXCUSE ME, MISS MIKINDOE.
- OH, HI.

11:31.580 --> 11:32.820
- HI.

11:32.930 --> 11:35.273
I KNOW WE HAVE A MEETING
ON THE BOOKS FOR FRIDAY

11:35.380 --> 11:37.792
AND YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT
TO SPEAK OUT OF SCHOOL BUT--

11:37.900 --> 11:39.686
- WELL, NO, I CAN'T.
- OH.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.483
- I MEAN,
FRIDAY IS THE BEST TIME.

11:41.590 --> 11:42.488
PRINCIPAL EVANS WILL BE THERE.

11:42.590 --> 11:45.832
- RIGHT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

11:45.940 --> 11:47.589
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME ANYTHING--

11:47.700 --> 11:51.284
JUST A LITTLE HEADS UP ON...

11:51.400 --> 11:52.594
- I REALLY CAN'T.
- OKAY.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.497
- OKAY.
_ OH--

11:55.610 --> 11:59.080
I CAN'T SLEEP.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.088
I'M...

12:01.200 --> 12:03.088
I'M REALLY HAVING
A ROUGH TIME

12:03.200 --> 12:04.997
NOT KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH MY SON.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.069
IT'S KIND OF ALL
I'M THINKING ABOUT, SO, UM...

12:08.170 --> 12:10.730
- THIS REALLY SHOULD COME
FROM THE PRINCIPAL.

12:10.830 --> 12:14.277
- WHAT?
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

12:14.380 --> 12:16.268
- WELL, I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD

12:16.390 --> 12:18.585
AND HE JUST KEEPS
FALLING MORE AND MORE BEHIND.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.008
- RIGHT.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.486
- WE DON'T WANT HIM
TO FALL ANYMORE BEHIND

12:21.600 --> 12:22.874
THAN HE ALREADY IS.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.424
- RIGHT.
- WE WANT HIM TO SUCCEED.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.703
- RIGHT.
SO...

12:26.810 --> 12:27.731
- SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING
THAT HE MOVE BACK

12:27.850 --> 12:30.637
TO THE FOURTH GRADE
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.639
- OKAY.
- I'M SORRY.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.264
I'M REALLY SORRY.
- NO.

12:36.370 --> 12:38.099
- I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS IS GONNA BE.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.997
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.749
I SHOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL
WE WERE WITH THE PRINCIPAL.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.203
- OH, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU TELLING ME.

12:44.310 --> 12:45.038
THANK YOU.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.199
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
- OKAY.

12:47.310 --> 12:47.799
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU FRIDAY.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.629
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.891
BYE.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.419
[cries quietly]

13:04.990 --> 13:07.049
- SO I KNOW I SUCK
AT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING,

13:07.160 --> 13:09.219
BUT APPARENTLY
NOT SQUASH.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.884
JULIA, WHAT'S WRONG?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.160
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:17.270 --> 13:18.476
- MM.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.137
OH, GOD.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.585
THEY'RE FINALLY MOVING VICTOR
BACK TO FOURTH GRADE NOW.

13:23.690 --> 13:25.726
AND...
I DON'T KNOW.

13:25.830 --> 13:31.279
- GOD, I'M SORRY, JULIA.
I AM.

13:31.390 --> 13:35.178
- [cries]

13:35.290 --> 13:37.042
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL HIM.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.122
OH, GOD.

14:00.660 --> 14:01.763
I'M GONNA...

14:01.870 --> 14:06.739
UM, GO TALK
TO MY HUSBAND.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.637
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.968
THANK YOU.
- YOU OKAY?

14:10.090 --> 14:11.489
- OKAY, YEAH.
I'M OKAY.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.874
[clears throat]

14:24.890 --> 14:27.029
- HEY, BRENDA. HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, KRISTINA.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.710
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, HE'S ON A CALL RIGHT NOW.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.229
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.931
- YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
- JUST ONE QUICK SECOND.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.246
IT'S FINE.
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.829
IT'LL BE TWO SECONDS.
- KRISTINA! HOW ARE YOU?

14:34.940 --> 14:37.170
- I'M GREAT, BOB.
HOW ARE YOU?

14:37.290 --> 14:38.905
- YOU WANT A COFFEE?
- NO, I DON'T WANT A COFFEE.

14:39.010 --> 14:40.386
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.
LISTEN TO ME.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.762
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TELL ME STRAIGHT

14:41.880 --> 14:42.665
THAT THIS STORY ABOUT ADAM
CAME FROM YOU.

14:42.770 --> 14:45.898
I KNOW THAT IT DID.
- COME ON.

14:46.020 --> 14:46.805
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WOULD DO THIS.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.979
I MEAN,
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.182
- YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
I WOULD DO WHAT TO YOU?

14:50.300 --> 14:53.053
- THIS IS A COMPLETE BETRAYAL
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP

14:53.160 --> 14:54.297
- BETRAYAL?
KRISTINA, HOLD ON A SECOND.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.536
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA HOLD ON.
I'M ACTUALLY PISSED.

14:55.650 --> 14:58.050
- CAMPAIGNS GET A LITTLE MESSY,
KRISTINA.

14:58.170 --> 14:59.614
- I GET IT.
I KNOW THAT.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.927
- WELL, IF YOU KNOW THAT,
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE YELLING--

15:02.030 --> 15:04.373
- I'M THE ONE RUNNING,
BOB, NOT MY FAMILY.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.822
- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.
- LEAVE THEM OUT OF IT, OKAY?

15:05.930 --> 15:09.457
DO YOU GET THAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT,

15:09.560 --> 15:10.936
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT I COULD SHARE

15:11.040 --> 15:13.417
ABOUT YOU, BOB, THAT...

15:13.530 --> 15:16.044
- GO AHEAD, KRISTINA.

15:16.150 --> 15:17.458
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SAY ANYTHING

15:17.570 --> 15:19.117
'CAUSE THAT'S
JUST NOT WHO YOU ARE.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.393
OTHERWISE, I WOULD HAVE WON
THAT CAMPAIGN TWO YEARS AGO.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.628
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LOSE
THIS ONE.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.570
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.261
NO IDEA.

15:28.370 --> 15:29.473
NOT A CLUE.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.468
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LITTLE LOOK ON HIS FACE.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.024
HE WAS SMIRKING AT ME.
I WANT TO, LIKE...

15:33.130 --> 15:34.540
I WANTED TO PUNCH HIM.

15:34.650 --> 15:36.094
HE KNOWS THAT I CAN'T
GO NEGATIVE ON THIS.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.654
- HE'S PLAYING MIND GAMES
WITH YOU.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.102
- HE'S PLAYING MIND GAMES
WITH ME.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.416
- YOU GOT TO PROVE HIM WRONG,
OKAY?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.373
- HOW AM I GONNA PROVE HIM
WRONG?

15:41.490 --> 15:43.139
- WITHOUT MENTIONING
AMBER'S NAME.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.218
- HOW, HONEY?
- BOB LITTLE.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.311
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
WITH AN INTERN AND THAT'S IT.

15:47.420 --> 15:48.762
- I DON'T WANT TO BRING AMBER
INTO THIS.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.007
IT'S LIKE--IT'S TOO PERSONAL.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.496
SHE'S FAMILY.
SHE'S MY NIECE.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.454
- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
HEATHER WEIGH IN ON THIS.

15:53.570 --> 15:54.594
- I AM NOT CHECKING
WITH HEATHER.

15:54.710 --> 15:55.734
IF I TELL HER ABOUT AMBER
AND BOB, IT'S OVER.

15:55.850 --> 15:56.839
YOU'VE MET HER, OKAY?

15:56.950 --> 15:59.180
SHE'LL GO RIGHT
FOR THE JUGULAR--

15:59.300 --> 16:01.120
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE
THE REASON THIS ENDS FOR YOU.

16:01.230 --> 16:04.051
- I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.478
I'M NOT LOSING.

16:05.580 --> 16:06.854
- I LOVE IT WHEN YOU GET FEISTY
LIKE THAT.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.951
- I'M NOT FEISTY. I'M JUST MAD.
- THE ONE THAT JUST--

16:09.070 --> 16:10.469
- I'M GOING DOWNSTAIRS
TO FIX THIS.

16:10.590 --> 16:11.784
- WHAT'D YOU DECIDE?

16:11.900 --> 16:14.107
HONEY?
[knock on door]

16:14.210 --> 16:15.552
- HEY.
- HEY.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.548
GOT YOU NOTE.
- I GOT YOUR WINE DELIVERY.

16:17.660 --> 16:18.866
- THANK YOU.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.551
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN AMAZING LABEL.

16:20.660 --> 16:21.797
- OH, YEAH?

16:21.910 --> 16:23.935
- I'M TOLD IT'S FRUIT-FORWARD
WITH A VERY BIG NOSE.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.494
- IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME.
- YOU COMING?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.659
- OH, I--YOU KNOW...

16:27.770 --> 16:29.874
YOU'RE THE TENANT.
I'M YOUR SUPER. I DON'T...

16:29.980 --> 16:32.289
- I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.220
ME AND A BUNCH OF 20-SOMETHING'S
DOING SHOOTERS,

16:34.330 --> 16:36.218
BUT I DO HAVE SOME FRIENDS
IN THEIR 30$.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.092
[whispers] EVEN THEIR 40$.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.088
- DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
- [laughs]

16:40.200 --> 16:41.997
- THANKS, BUT I HAVE
A FAMILY THING.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.819
- OKAY.
THANKS FOR HANGING ONTO IT.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.921
- SURE.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.962
- HEY, SARAH?

16:49.070 --> 16:51.129
YOU KNOW,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...

16:51.250 --> 16:53.889
EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME
TO MY PARTY SATURDAY,

16:54.010 --> 16:55.523
YOU SHOULD GO TO A PARTY.

16:55.630 --> 16:59.009
YEAH, A WOMAN LIKE YOU
SHOULD BE OUT ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.983
- WELL, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE

17:07.090 --> 17:08.125
IS NOT A FAMILY VALUE.

17:08.230 --> 17:11.028
I THINK THIS IS REALLY
ABOUT MOVING...

17:11.130 --> 17:13.052
- BOY, HAVE I SEEN IT.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17:13.170 --> 17:15.126
- I AM JUST DISGUSTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.128
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD DO THIS.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.821
- AMBER, I CAN'T EITHER.
I'M JUST--

17:18.930 --> 17:19.783
I'M SO BUMMED, YOU KNOW?

17:19.900 --> 17:22.448
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE...

17:22.550 --> 17:24.552
- I THOUGHT HE WAS,
LIKE, A GOOD GUY GENERALLY.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.628
- WE WERE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?
- WE'RE FRIENDS.

17:26.730 --> 17:30.598
I JUST FEEL, LIKE,
TOTALLY BETRAYED AND...

17:30.700 --> 17:33.453
- IT'S SO AWFUL.
- I'M JUST TIRED AND...

17:33.560 --> 17:35.733
I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.728
- I...

17:37.840 --> 17:39.467
DON'T YOU DARE.
- YOU HAVE TO.

17:39.570 --> 17:41.049
- OKAY?
- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NO WAY--

17:41.160 --> 17:43.253
- UNCLE ADAM AND I
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

17:43.370 --> 17:44.951
AND HE'S BEEN ASKING--

17:45.060 --> 17:46.266
- GOOD. GOOD.
- NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.

17:46.370 --> 17:49.123
I'M NOT PULLING YOU INTO THIS.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.379
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN LET
HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS--

17:51.480 --> 17:52.993
WITH SPINNING SOMETHING
LIKE WHAT UNCLE DID

17:53.100 --> 17:56.410
INTO THIS WHEN
WE HAVE THIS ON HIM.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.306
- I KNOW WE HAVE IT,
BUT, HONEY,

17:58.420 --> 17:59.751
YOU WOULD BE ALL OVER
THE MEDIA.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.100
THEY WOULD BE FOLLOWING YOU.
- THAT'S FINE.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.007
- TO WORK, HOME, EVERYTHING.
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

18:04.110 --> 18:05.452
I DON'T WANT THIS GUY
IN OFFICE.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.595
- I KNOW.
- HE'S DISHONEST.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.349
- I DON'T EITHER,
BUT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.143
- DO YOU PROMISE YOU'LL
THINK ABOUT IT FOR REAL?

18:10.260 --> 18:11.329
- I SWEAR I WILL.
I PROMISE.

18:11.430 --> 18:12.465
- DO YOU PROMISE.
- I PINKIE PROMISE...

18:12.570 --> 18:14.731
- PINKIE PROMISE.
- THAT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.397
- [laughs]
- WHAT--WAIT.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.365
WHAT IS THAT?
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT?

18:18.470 --> 18:20.222
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS, LIKE--

18:20.340 --> 18:23.400
I CAN'T SEE.
HONEY, THAT IS SO PRETTY.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.956
- YEAH, IT'S--YEAH.
- OH, HOW SWEET.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.402
OH.
- YEAH.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.658
- YOU DON'T REALLY LOVE IT?

18:32.760 --> 18:34.580
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABSURD,
RIGHT?

18:34.690 --> 18:35.861
IT'S NOT JUST ME?

18:35.970 --> 18:37.073
I MEAN, IT'S BIGGER THAN ANY

18:37.180 --> 18:40.559
OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS
WEDDING RINGS, I MEAN--

18:40.670 --> 18:42.285
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIGGER
THAN MINE, BUT...

18:42.390 --> 18:43.379
- [laughs] LIKE,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.047
- ENJOY IT, YOU KNOW?
- I DON'T NEED IT.

18:45.150 --> 18:46.947
AND HE SPENT ALL
OF HIS MONEY ON IT.

18:47.050 --> 18:50.156
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.080
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE MARRIED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.679
HAVE THIS TALK WITH HIM
AND TELL HIM

18:53.780 --> 18:55.987
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT FINANCES AND MAYBE JUST...

18:56.100 --> 18:58.159
- I'M JUST SCARED.
- JUST TELL HIM.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.089
- I DON'T WANT TO HURT
HIS FEELINGS.

18:59.200 --> 19:03.022
I FEEL LIKE HE'S
GONNA GET UPSET.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.439
- ARE YOU SURE
IT'S JUST ABOUT THE RING?

19:06.550 --> 19:07.585
- YEAH.
- OH, OKAY.

19:07.690 --> 19:09.829
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
I JUST...YEAH.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.489
- GOOD.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.321
- OKAY, THEY'RE BOTH
DOING HOMEWORK.

19:21.430 --> 19:25.605
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.883
I WAS RIGHT.
THEY'RE GONNA HOLD HIM BACK.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.744
- AND YOU KNOW THIS...

19:30.850 --> 19:33.717
- I RAN INTO MISS MIKINDOE
TODAY AT SCHOOL AND SHE TOLD ME.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.503
- RAN INTO?
- YEAH.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.575
I WAS THERE
FOR SUSTAINABILITY.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.829
- AND YOU JUST
COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.067
- JOEL.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.341
- I MEAN, YOU CAN'T CALL ME
ABOUT THIS,

19:41.450 --> 19:42.963
OR TEXT ME HAVE A DISCUSSION--
- YOU WERE AT WORK.

19:43.070 --> 19:45.038
AND I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.653
- SO YOU WENT
AND HAD OUR CONVERSATION

19:46.770 --> 19:48.692
WITH MISS MIKINDOE
WITHOUT ME.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.836
- I RAN INTO HER AND CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE, HERE?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.976
OUR SON IS BEING YANKED OUT
OF HIS CLASS

19:53.080 --> 19:55.014
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

19:55.120 --> 19:58.157
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.080
- NO.
WE ARE NOT DOING THAT.

20:00.190 --> 20:02.260
- I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHOICE.

20:02.370 --> 20:03.746
- YES, WE DO, JULIA.

20:03.850 --> 20:05.260
WE'RE GONNA GO IN
AND TELL THE PRINCIPAL

20:05.370 --> 20:06.678
THAT HE CAN GO SCREW HIMSELF.

20:06.790 --> 20:07.745
- OH.

20:07.860 --> 20:09.509
- WE'RE GONNA
PULL OUT SON OUT RIGHT NOW?

20:09.620 --> 20:10.928
IT'S GONNA BE A TOTAL DISASTER
FOR HIM.

20:11.030 --> 20:11.997
- I KNOW.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.089
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DO IT

20:13.210 --> 20:14.586
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

20:14.690 --> 20:16.442
- OH, SO THIS IS MY FAULT?
THIS IS ALL ON ME?

20:16.560 --> 20:17.788
- NO.
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

20:17.900 --> 20:19.208
- CAN YOU--
- I AM NOT DOING THAT TO HIM.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.480
I AM NOT GONNA DO THAT TO HIM.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.272
- IT'S A SITUATION
THAT WE'RE IN NOW.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.039
- WE'LL FIND A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.242
WE'LL FIND SOME SORT OF WAY--

20:24.360 --> 20:25.110
- JOEL, WE CAN'T AFFORD
A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.597
ON JUST YOUR SALARY.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.281
WHAT?
- I'M BEING PRACTICAL.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.152
LET'S LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS.
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.602
- ON MY SALARY?
- ON YOUR SALARY.

20:32.710 --> 20:35.087
- WELL, NO ONE ASKED YOU
TO GO QUIT YOUR JOB, DID THEY?

20:35.190 --> 20:36.703
BUT YOU WENT AND DID THAT.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.674
JUST LIKE YOU WENT
AND TALKED TO MISS MIKINDOE.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.429
ALL THESE DECISIONS
YOU'RE MAKING,

20:40.540 --> 20:42.303
THEY'RE BAD DECISIONS.

20:42.410 --> 20:43.229
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, HERE.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.141
- G-GET OF MY LAWN

20:57.250 --> 20:57.978
G-G-GET OFF MY LAWN

20:58.080 --> 21:00.799
WHAT

21:00.910 --> 21:01.387
G-G-GET OFF MY LAWN

21:01.500 --> 21:04.776
G-G-GET OFF MY LAWN

21:04.880 --> 21:06.017
THAT'S A GOOD SINGLE.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.223
YOU SHOULD DROP
THAT SINGLE FIRST

21:07.330 --> 21:08.638
BEFORE YOUR WHOLE ALBUM
COMES OUT.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.012
- I WAS AFRAID
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.290
- WHAT AN INTERVIEW.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.776
I MEAN "INTERVIEW."

21:12.890 --> 21:14.198
I FORGOT WHAT A TOUGH GUY
YOU ARE

21:14.300 --> 21:15.744
THAT YOU PUNCHED THAT GUY OUT.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.328
AND THEN THE WAY THEY REMIXED,
THEY REALLY CAPTURED

21:18.440 --> 21:19.850
THIS SWEET SPOT OF YOUR VOICE.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.235
- YOU'RE PRETTY HAPPY WITH
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU.

21:22.350 --> 21:23.749
- HONESTLY,
IT REALLY PICKED ME UP.

21:23.860 --> 21:24.963
- UH-HUH.
- IT DID.

21:25.070 --> 21:27.584
LOOK, THINGS AREN'T PERFECT
FOR ME AT HOME EITHER.

21:27.700 --> 21:34.549
JABBAR CHOSE, OVER BASKETBALL,
FOR HIS WINTER SPORT, BALLET.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.353
THAT'S NOT EVEN A SPORT.
- BALLET. THAT'S COOL.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.529
- IT'S COOL?
- YEAH.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.494
- BALLET?
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.589
- WELL, HE WAS IN THE OUTFIT.

21:40.710 --> 21:43.156
HE HAD THE WHOLE--
YOU KNOW, HE WAS...

21:43.260 --> 21:48.334
TWIRLING AROUND THE KITCHEN
IN A SUPER THIN, YOU KNOW...

21:48.440 --> 21:50.988
- IS IT TOUGH--KIND OF TOUGH
FOR YOU TO SEE THAT?

21:51.100 --> 21:52.124
YEAH?
- YEAH.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.265
- IS THERE ANY OTHER
GUYS IN THE CLASS?

21:54.380 --> 21:56.894
- NO.
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.683
LOOK AT THAT.
HE'S WORKING THE RATIO, THERE.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.539
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF GIRLS
AND HIM.

21:59.660 --> 22:01.412
HE'S GOT IT MADE.
- OKAY, I--

22:01.520 --> 22:02.316
I'M NOT CONCERNED
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

22:02.420 --> 22:04.559
MY 10-YEAR-OLD'S
GONNA GET LAID.

22:04.660 --> 22:08.039
I'M TALKING ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH HIM

22:08.150 --> 22:09.071
THAT I COULD CONNECT
WITH HIM ON.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.568
- I GET IT, OKAY?

22:10.670 --> 22:12.592
CROSBY, YOUR KIDS AREN'T ALWAYS
GONNA BE INTERESTED

22:12.710 --> 22:14.189
IN THE THINGS THAT
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.769
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS
GONNA BE INTERESTED

22:15.880 --> 22:17.290
IN THE THINGS YOU WANT THEM
TO BE, OKAY?

22:17.400 --> 22:19.504
I WISH THAT MAX
HAD BEEN MORE INTERESTED

22:19.610 --> 22:20.326
IN BASEBALL THAN BUGS.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.408
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKED OUT.

22:22.510 --> 22:25.570
OKAY?
SO I GOT INTERESTED IN BUGS.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.614
- MM-HMM.

22:30.340 --> 22:31.921
- HEY, BUD, WHERE'S VICTOR?

22:32.040 --> 22:33.371
- UH, HE'S OUTSIDE PLAYING.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.685
HE SAID HE FINISHED
HIS HOMEWORK.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.587
- OH.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.486
OKAY.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.908
HOW ABOUT YOU?

22:42.010 --> 22:43.693
HAVE YOU CHOSEN WHICH MISSION
YOU'RE GONNA DO?

22:43.810 --> 22:45.835
- YEAH, THE SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO.

22:45.950 --> 22:47.178
YOU KNOW THE SWALLOWS
FLY THERE EVERY YEAR?

22:47.290 --> 22:49.497
- I DID KNOW THAT.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.112
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
TOOK ME DOWN THERE

22:50.230 --> 22:51.254
WHEN I WAS A KID.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.362
PRETTY COOL.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.084
OKAY.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.328
- MOMMY?
- YEAH?

22:58.440 --> 23:00.192
- IF VICTOR GOES BACK
TO FOURTH GRADE,

23:00.300 --> 23:03.189
WILL HE HAD TO DO
ANOTHER MISSIONS REPORT?

23:03.310 --> 23:05.028
- NO.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.653
NO, HE DID THAT.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.172
SO...

23:09.280 --> 23:12.761
GOSH, I DON'T--UM...

23:12.870 --> 23:14.076
I DON'T KNOW.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.171
HEY, YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT THAT, HAVE YOU?

23:16.290 --> 23:17.803
- NO, I HAVEN'T.
- GOOD.

23:17.910 --> 23:22.085
BECAUSE NOTHING'S
BEEN DECIDED YET, SO...

23:24.540 --> 23:26.428
IT'S JUST--
IT'S COMPLICATED, YOU KNOW?

23:26.540 --> 23:28.565
IT'S FOR ALL THE GROWN-UPS.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.534
IT'S FOR THE SCHOOL
AND FOR VICTOR'S TEACHERS

23:30.650 --> 23:35.189
AND FOR DADDY AND I
TO FIGURE OUT.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.441
OKAY?

23:39.550 --> 23:41.609
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.100
- IS THAT WHY YOU AND DADDY HAVE
BEEN FIGHTING SO MUCH LATELY?

23:49.350 --> 23:51.215
- NO, WE HAVEN'T BEEN FIGHTING.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.355
NO, SWEETIE, UM,
YOU KNOW,

23:59.470 --> 24:01.802
SOMETIMES WE JUST DISAGREE,

24:01.920 --> 24:04.605
BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S OKAY.

24:29.390 --> 24:31.392

24:52.560 --> 24:53.754

FACEBOOK PAGE.

24:53.870 --> 24:55.349
THAT'S WHERE THAT'S FROM.
- THIS WAS A SOCCER GAME?

24:55.450 --> 24:57.418
- HE TOOK IT FROM THE INTERNET.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.929
- THE REF CALLED HER
FOR TRIPPING.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.177
SHE WAS MAKING A PLAY
ON THE BALL.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.212
I CAN'T BELIEVE--HOW CAN HE JUST
GRAB THIS STUFF

25:02.320 --> 25:03.639
AND HAVE IT BE IN THE PAPER?

25:03.740 --> 25:05.492
- BECAUSE HE'S A JERK.
THAT'S HOW HE COULD OD THIS.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.942
- WE NEED TO CALL
A PRESS CONFERENCE.

25:07.050 --> 25:07.562
I FEEL THAT'S WHAT
I HAVE TO DO.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.297
I THINK I'M GOING TO.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.492
WE NEED TO CALL--
- GOOD.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.089

PRESS CONFERENCE?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.784
ABOUT TIME WHAT, ADAM?

25:15.890 --> 25:17.471
- WITH WHAT?
- NOTHING.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.717
- JUST TELL HIM TO STOP IT.

25:18.820 --> 25:19.809
- YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
SOMETHING.

25:19.930 --> 25:23.229
KRISTINA, YOU GOT SOMETHING
ON THIS GUY?

25:27.350 --> 25:28.305
- I LIKED IT.
DID YOU LIKE IT?

25:28.420 --> 25:30.274
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.
- MM-HMM.

25:30.390 --> 25:34.178
- YEAH, IT WAS GOOD.

25:34.290 --> 25:35.484
- WHAT'S THIS?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.522
- WHAT?
- WHY YOU TWIDDLING IT?

25:37.630 --> 25:39.495
- I DON'T KNOW.
- IS IT TOO BIG.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.568
- NO.
- LET'S GET IT RESIZED.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.149
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S NOT.

25:43.260 --> 25:45.319
- IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY SAID I COULD BRING IT BACK.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.249
- IT'S NOT THAT.
- IT IS TOO BIG.

25:47.370 --> 25:50.259
- NO, I DID WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ONE THING ABOUT IT THOUGH.

25:50.370 --> 25:51.951
I HAD AN IDEA.
- WHAT?

25:52.060 --> 25:53.709
- I THOUGHT WE COULD
TALK ABOUT IT TOGETHER.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.402
- OKAY.
- UM...

25:56.520 --> 26:01.685
I CAN'T--I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY IT WAS.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.176
- WILL YOU STOP?
- IT WAS SO MUCH.

26:03.280 --> 26:06.078
IT WAS ALL OF YOUR COMBAT PAY.
- WILL YOU STOP?

26:06.180 --> 26:08.592
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

26:08.700 --> 26:09.314
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED
TO SPEND MY MONEY ON.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.523
THIS IS A SPECIAL THING.

26:10.630 --> 26:12.803
- BUT, BABY, THAT'S
WHAT I'M SAYING.

26:12.910 --> 26:15.390
AND IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T LOVE THAT SENTIMENT,

26:15.500 --> 26:17.946
BECAUSE I DO,
BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE

26:18.050 --> 26:19.870
IT'S OUR MONEY NOW,
AND SO I--

26:19.990 --> 26:22.811
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
THE BEST WAY TO SPEND IT IS

26:22.920 --> 26:25.059
BECAUSE, LIKE, WHAT IF WE WANT
TO TRAVEL?

26:25.160 --> 26:26.092
WHAT IF WE WANT TO...

26:26.200 --> 26:28.236
WHAT IF WE WANT TO START
A FAMILY OR GET A HOUSE?

26:28.340 --> 26:29.329
LIKE, DON'T WE--

26:29.440 --> 26:31.374
- WELL, THEN...
ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA COME.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.856
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET THEM
ALL AT ONCE.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.619
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

26:34.730 --> 26:36.379
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AND YOU'RE GONNA WEAR

26:36.490 --> 26:38.344
ON YOUR FINGER
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

26:38.450 --> 26:40.554
AND I WANT YOU TO FEEL SPECIAL
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE

26:40.660 --> 26:42.104
SOME CHEAP RING
THAT'S NOT GONNA--

26:42.220 --> 26:44.040
- BUT, BABY, I WOULD FEEL
JUST AS SPECIAL

26:44.150 --> 26:47.734
AND LOVE SOMETHING
A LITTLE SMALLER JUST AS MUCH

26:47.840 --> 26:48.829
IF IT FELT LIKE WE WANTED
TO MAYBE SAVE

26:48.950 --> 26:50.872
SOME OF THAT MONEY
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.777
THAT'S ALL I WANTED
TO GET YOUR OPINION ON.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.108
- I, UH--YEAH, YEAH.

26:54.230 --> 26:55.674
WE'LL BRING IT BACK
AND TRADE IT IN AND--

26:55.780 --> 26:57.463
- WELL, WAIT, BABE,
I WANTED--DO YOU FEEL GOOD?

26:57.580 --> 26:58.911
I MEAN, DOES THAT
MAKE YOU SENSE?

26:59.030 --> 27:01.021
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE SOME OF THAT
MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

27:01.130 --> 27:02.779
- YEAH.
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

27:02.890 --> 27:03.754
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
- RYAN, ARE YOU UPSET?

27:03.860 --> 27:05.543
I LOVE YOU.
- NO. I LOVE YOU TOO.

27:05.650 --> 27:06.378
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.009
- ARE YOU EXCITED
TO EAT FRUIT LOOPS?

27:16.110 --> 27:17.099
ARE YOU COUNTING DOWN
THE DAYS

27:17.220 --> 27:18.209
SO THAT YOU CAN EAT
FRUIT LOOPS?

27:18.320 --> 27:22.529
- GOOD MORNING, MY LOVE.
- GOOD MORNING.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.870
- HI.

27:24.980 --> 27:26.424

YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

27:26.540 --> 27:28.019
-IAM. IAM.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.259
I JUST LOVE THESE CLASSES

27:30.370 --> 27:32.600
I MEAN, I'M TRYING
NOT TO JINX IT, YOU KNOW?

27:32.720 --> 27:35.223
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
HE'S REALLY INTO IT.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.228
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW,
WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.446
- YEAH, LIKE A LITTLE
BARYSHNIKOV ON OUR HANDS.

27:40.550 --> 27:42.996
- YEAH, A LITTLE
BARYSHNIKOV.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.579
- WHAT?
ISN'T THAT A GOOD ONE?

27:44.690 --> 27:46.100
- THAT'S A GREAT ONE,

27:46.210 --> 27:48.485
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE NOT REALLY
COOL WITH IT, SO...

27:48.590 --> 27:50.558
- NO, NO, I'M NOT
NOT COOL WITH IT.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.036
- REALLY?

27:52.150 --> 27:54.801
I MEAN, I'M...

27:54.910 --> 27:56.559

DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

28:08.790 --> 28:09.506

28:09.610 --> 28:12.682
YOUR VERY BOYISH BOY,

28:12.790 --> 28:13.779

28:30.630 --> 28:31.836
I THINK YOU'LL REALLY LIKE IT.

28:31.950 --> 28:34.009
- I WILL THINK
ABOUT THAT.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.429
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO
STEP ON YOUR GUYS' THING.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.668
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.260

OR THEY--

29:37.980 --> 29:40.665
- WELL, THEY'RE NOT
GETTING IT FROM ME.

29:40.770 --> 29:43.079
- JOEL, SYDNEY ASKED ME
YESTERDAY

29:43.190 --> 29:45.078
WHY WE'RE FIGHTING
SO MUCH.

29:49.300 --> 29:52.292
- WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO DO A BETTER JOB, I GUESS.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.569
- WE HAVE TO TALK TO VICTOR
AND WE HAVE TO, YOU KNOW,

29:58.690 --> 30:01.067
GET ON THE SAME PAGE, HERE.

30:01.170 --> 30:02.865
WE CAN'T BE DOING THIS.
- I KNOW, JULIA.

30:02.970 --> 30:07.202
- UNDERMINING EACH OTHER,
YOU KNOW?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.971
- I WILL BE THERE FOR MY SON.

30:17.710 --> 30:20.087
[engine starts]

30:20.190 --> 30:22.886
- POWERING THROUGH
A BIG HOLE IN THE LEFT SIDE,

30:22.990 --> 30:24.571
NOW NEAR THE 25.

30:24.680 --> 30:25.840
- I DON'T GET IT, DAD.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.166
THIS IS NOT THE SAME GAME

30:27.270 --> 30:28.339
WE WERE WATCHING
AN HOUR AGO?

30:28.440 --> 30:30.192
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:30.310 --> 30:31.686
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
- THEY PLAY ALL DAY.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.236
THESE LOOK LIKE
THE SAME GUYS.

30:34.340 --> 30:35.580
- YEAH.
- LIKE, THE SAME COLORS.

30:35.690 --> 30:37.419
- [mumbles]

30:37.520 --> 30:39.203
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS HOW

30:39.320 --> 30:40.890
YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR SATURDAY.

30:41.010 --> 30:42.830
- WELL, THIS IS HOW
YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR SATURDAY.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.077
I MEAN, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.317
YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE
MEETING PEOPLE.

30:45.420 --> 30:48.002
YOU KNOW, HAVING FUN.
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING THAT?

30:48.120 --> 30:50.805
- EXCUSE ME, I DON'T NEED TO BE
OUT THERE MEETING PEOPLE.

30:50.910 --> 30:53.663
I'M HERE WITH MY DEAR
OLD DAD.

30:53.780 --> 30:57.250
AND IF YOU MUST KNOW,
I WAS INVITED

30:57.370 --> 31:00.601
TO A PARTY TONIGHT,
AND I'M NOT GOING.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.675
- WHY AREN'T YOU GOING?

31:01.790 --> 31:05.169
- BECAUSE.
HERE WITH YOU.

31:05.270 --> 31:08.330
PLUS, I WON'T...
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.827
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
A CHANCE TO KNOW ANYBODY

31:10.930 --> 31:11.680
SITTING AROUND HERE
WITH YOUR OLD MAN.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.007
- I DON'T NEED A MAN, DAD.

31:14.110 --> 31:15.486
I AM FINE ON MY OWN,
YOU KNOW.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.649
- WELL, I WASN'T NECESSARILY
TALKING ABOUT A MAN, SARAH.

31:17.770 --> 31:20.238
- OH.
- YOU'VE CHANGED, AND I...

31:20.360 --> 31:20.974
YOU STARTED
THIS WHOLE NEW LIFE.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.900
YOU GOT A WHOLE NEW PLACE.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.568
YOU CAN GO OUT THERE
AND HAVE ADVENTURES,

31:24.670 --> 31:28.356
AND YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS
LIKE YOUR MOTHER'S

31:28.470 --> 31:29.494
TALKING ABOUT DOING.

31:29.610 --> 31:31.180
JUST GO DO THAT,
YOU KNOW?

31:31.300 --> 31:32.608
- WHO'S GONNA
HANG OUT HERE WITH YOU?

31:32.710 --> 31:36.783
- WELL, QUITE FRANKLY,
HAVING YOU AROUND HERE

31:36.890 --> 31:38.858
COMPLAINING ABOUT
WHAT I'M DOING, AND...

31:38.960 --> 31:40.928
- ALL RIGHT, DAD,
I'M GONNA EXPAND, OKAY?

31:41.030 --> 31:44.852
I'M GONNA EXPAND MY HORIZONS
TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE

31:44.970 --> 31:47.109
AND I'M GONNA GO TO THIS PARTY

31:47.210 --> 31:49.098
WHERE I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY,
OKAY?

31:49.210 --> 31:51.485
- AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING
ALL OF THAT,

31:51.590 --> 31:52.591
YOU MIGHT MEET A NICE GUY.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.554
- [groans]
I DON'T WANT TO MET A GUY, DAD.

31:54.670 --> 31:55.739
- OKAY. FINE.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.148
BUT IN CASE I DO,
I'M TAKING YOUR BEER.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.761
GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.804
- TWO YEARS AGO, BOB LITTLE HAD
AN INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP

32:01.920 --> 32:05.538
WITH MY NIECE, WHO WAS THEN
HIS 19-YEAR-OLD ASSISTANT.

32:08.270 --> 32:09.749
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

32:10.790 --> 32:15.443
AMBER WANTS YOU TO.

32:21.730 --> 32:25.109
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.349
[clears throat]

32:27.460 --> 32:28.939
THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

32:29.050 --> 32:30.938
THERE'S A LOT MORE OF YOU HERE

32:31.050 --> 32:32.733
THAN WHEN I ANNOUNCED
MY CANDIDACY,

32:32.840 --> 32:35.946
SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE.

32:36.050 --> 32:38.678
I DON'T THINK THIS CAMPAIGN

32:38.780 --> 32:40.839
SHOULD BE ABOUT
PERSONAL ATTACKS,

32:40.950 --> 32:42.815
WHICH IS WHY AFTER
MUCH SOUL-SEARCHING,

32:42.920 --> 32:45.912
I AM COMPELLED TO SPEAK OUT
AGAINST WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON

32:46.030 --> 32:50.990
IN THE MEDIA, ABOUT MY FAMILY,
ABOUT MYSELF.

33:00.730 --> 33:03.210
TH REE YEARS AGO,
MY HUSBAND WAS CHECKING OUT

33:03.320 --> 33:06.801
OF A GROCERY STORE
WHEN A VERY RUDE MAN

33:06.910 --> 33:10.255
CALLED MY SON A RETARD.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.112
AND WHILE I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE

33:12.230 --> 33:15.324
THAT THE WORD "RETARD"
IS VERY UGLY,

33:15.440 --> 33:18.079
I THINK IT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE
WHEN YOUR SON

33:18.200 --> 33:21.988
HAS ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.443
SO MY HUSBAND,
BEING THE PROTECTIVE FATHER

33:24.550 --> 33:27.018
THAT HE IS...

33:27.140 --> 33:29.415
WELL, HE PUNCHED THE MAN.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.681
ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR

33:31.800 --> 33:34.519
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I'M FIGHTING AGAINST

33:34.630 --> 33:36.769
IS EXACTLY THIS TYPE
OF INTOLERANCE.

33:36.870 --> 33:40.180
MY HUSBAND WON'T STAND FOR IT,
AND NEITHER WILL I.

33:40.290 --> 33:43.737
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT THOSE ARE OUR VALUES.

33:44.980 --> 33:47.119
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS,

33:47.230 --> 33:48.436
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER.

33:48.540 --> 33:51.191
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT BOB LITTLE'S TACTICS

33:51.300 --> 33:52.198
IN THIS CAMPAIGN?

33:52.300 --> 33:54.507
- I HAVE NO COMMENT.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.160
[gentle guitar music]

34:03.280 --> 34:05.794
- HEY.
- HI.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.003
IT'S SO LATE.

34:07.110 --> 34:09.101
I TRIED TO CALL YOU
A COUPLE TIMES.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.791
- SORRY. I DON'T KNOW.
SORRY.

34:10.910 --> 34:12.662
- IT'S OKAY.

34:12.770 --> 34:13.930
- GOT OFF LATE.

34:14.050 --> 34:16.769
I TOOK THE RING BACK.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.869
PRETTY EASY.

34:17.980 --> 34:20.949
- YOU DID?
- YEAH.

34:21.050 --> 34:22.085
SO IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

34:24.710 --> 34:26.189
- UM, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

34:26.300 --> 34:29.428
DO YOU FEEL...
DO YOU FEEL OKAY ABOUT IT ALL?

34:29.550 --> 34:31.302
- YEAH, YEAH.
I FEEL GREAT.

34:31.410 --> 34:33.958
JUST GONNA GET
THE RIGHT ONE.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.549
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT

34:35.650 --> 34:36.275
THAT I DIDN'T LOVE IT
VERY MUCH.

34:36.380 --> 34:38.109
I DID.
- NO, I KNOW.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.029
- IT'S BECAUSE IT'S BETTER
FOR US, RIGHT?

34:39.140 --> 34:41.244
LIKE, WE CAN--
- ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.

34:41.350 --> 34:42.578
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

34:42.700 --> 34:43.792
I REALLY WANT TO DO THAT.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.003
- OKAY.
- THAT'S GOOD.

34:45.110 --> 34:47.169
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.667
- HEY, YOU WANT A LITTLE COMPANY
OVER THERE?

34:49.770 --> 34:51.249
- AH, I'M GONNA COME TO BED
IN JUST A SEC.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.045
I'M JUST--I'M JUST RELAXING.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.082
MM.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.855
- HEY, KIDDO.
CAN WE TALK?

35:11.970 --> 35:12.925
- SURE.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.133
- OKAY.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.173
- UM...

35:23.390 --> 35:24.971
THIS WEEK,
YOUR DAD AND I

35:25.080 --> 35:25.899
HAVE BEEN TALKING
TO MISS MIKINDOE.

35:26.020 --> 35:28.215
- AM I IN TROUBLE?
- NO.

35:28.330 --> 35:30.776
- NO, JUST THE OPPOSITE.
- YEAH, NOT AT ALL.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.155
- SO PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.330
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU'RE WORKING SO HARD.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.159
- MY GRADES STILL SUCK.

35:38.270 --> 35:42.957
- WELL, HERE'S WHAT WE WANT
FOR YOU.

35:43.070 --> 35:43.991
WE WANT YOU TO HAVE
A PLACE

35:44.100 --> 35:46.728
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE SOME TIME
TO CATCH UP

35:46.830 --> 35:49.207
AND YOU CAN WORK
ON YOUR READING SKILLS.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.892
AND SO YOUR DAD AND I
THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE

35:52.010 --> 35:56.788
GOOD FOR YOU TO SPEND THE REST
OF THE YEAR IN FOURTH GRADE.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.914
- I DON'T WANT TO--
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

36:04.020 --> 36:07.467
- I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

36:07.570 --> 36:09.743
AND WE'LL BE HERE FOR YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

36:09.850 --> 36:11.124
- NO, NO, THIS ISN'T FAIR.

36:11.230 --> 36:12.162
WE'RE ALMOST HALF WAY
THROUGH THE YEAR.

36:12.270 --> 36:16.309
- BUDDY, I KNOW
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

36:16.410 --> 36:18.207
- WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
DONE IT SOONER, VICTOR,

36:18.310 --> 36:20.164
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.134
- BUT THEN I'LL BE
IN THE SAME GRADE AS SYDNEY?

36:22.240 --> 36:24.060
AND WHAT ABOUT ALL MY FRIENDS?

36:24.180 --> 36:25.795
I'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.903
- YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU STARTED
LITTLE LEAGUE?

36:29.010 --> 36:30.409
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW HARD THAT WAS

36:30.530 --> 36:32.805
AND HOW SCARY IT WAS
TO YOU AT FIRST?

36:32.910 --> 36:34.354
YOU'D NEVER DONE IT.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.519
- AND YOU PRACTICED SO HARD.
- EXACTLY.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.868
- YOU REALLY PUT IN THE TIME.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.709
YOU PUT IN THE WORK
AND THEN IT CLICKED FOR IT.

36:39.810 --> 36:41.368
- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS GONNA BE.

36:41.470 --> 36:43.506
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO FOURTH
AND YOU'RE GONNA, YOU KNOW,

36:43.610 --> 36:46.192
TRY SO HARD
AND THEN IT'S JUST GONNA CLICK.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.541
YOU KNOW?
IT'S JUST GONNA CLICK FOR YOU.

36:48.650 --> 36:50.925
AND FROM THAT POINT ON...
- VICTOR.

36:51.030 --> 36:52.645
YOU CAN DO THIS.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.990
YOU'RE A BRAVE BOY.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS

36:55.100 --> 37:00.311
AND WE'LL HELP YOU.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.217
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.002
- I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.089
GET OUT.

37:12.190 --> 37:13.009
I SAID TO GET OUT!

37:36.940 --> 37:40.046
- AND WHEN THE SINGING
IS THROUGH...

37:40.150 --> 37:42.038
[beeping]

37:42.150 --> 37:44.459
- YEAH.

37:44.570 --> 37:47.949
WOW.

37:48.050 --> 37:49.039
HI!

37:51.370 --> 37:53.224

ON MY WAY OUT.

37:53.340 --> 37:54.819
I WAS ABOUT TO RUN
FOR THE BUS.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.262
- OKAY.
BOY.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.019
HEY, MILL--CAMILLE,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, HONEY.

37:58.130 --> 38:00.121
ARE YOU HAVING A GREAT TIME?

38:00.240 --> 38:03.539
- OH, IT'S JUST BEEN AMAZING.

38:03.660 --> 38:06.686
UM, LET ME SEE.
WHERE DO I START?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.200
WE'VE BEEN PAINTING
EVERY MORNING.

38:09.320 --> 38:13.279
THE TEACHER IS JUST--
HE'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.

38:13.390 --> 38:16.188
I'M LEARNING SO MUCH.
- OH, GOOD.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.143
- AND TOMORROW
WE GO TO FLORENCE.

38:17.260 --> 38:20.320
WE'RE GOING TO SKETCH
AT THE UFFIZI.

38:20.430 --> 38:23.046
- WHAT?

38:23.160 --> 38:25.014
THE--IT'S A MUSEUM.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.882

AND THE FOOD.

38:33.550 --> 38:35.950
SWEETIE, YOU WOULD
JUT LOVE IT.

38:36.070 --> 38:37.094
THE PASTA IS SO FRESH!

38:37.210 --> 38:40.441
IT'S ALWAYS AL DENTE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU EAT.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.552
COULD BE A LITTLE
HOLE-IN-THE-WALL RESTAURANT.

38:42.660 --> 38:44.412
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.556
- HOW ARE YOU?

38:46.660 --> 38:48.002
GREAT, GREAT.
EVERYTHING'S FINE HERE.

38:48.110 --> 38:50.214
I'M WATERING THE PLANTS.
THE KIDS ARE STOPPING BY.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.493
THEY'RE BOTHERING ME,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

38:52.600 --> 38:53.703
I MISS YOU, MILLIE.

38:53.810 --> 38:54.469
I MISS YOU.

38:54.570 --> 38:57.539
- ANDIAMO.
- OH, I GOTTA GO.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.868

38:58.990 --> 39:00.844
- BUT--OKAY, WELL,

39:00.950 --> 39:02.815
MILLIE, I LOVE YOU.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.955
DID YOU--I LOVE YOU!

39:04.060 --> 39:05.470
BUT...

39:07.240 --> 39:09.060
WHAT...

39:11.170 --> 39:14.230
OKAY.

39:14.350 --> 39:15.339
- HONEY, IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF GOOD.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.179
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING
IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.419
- OH, YEAH?
- YUP.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.488
"WE'RE WITH YOU, KRISTINA.
KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.908
WAY TO STAND UP
FOR YOUR FAMILY."

39:23.010 --> 39:23.931
- LOOK AT THAT.

39:24.050 --> 39:25.449
- SO THEY WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

39:25.570 --> 39:27.117
- SEE, YOU DON'T NEED TO
PARTICIPATE IN

39:27.220 --> 39:28.323
A SMEAR CAMPAIGN
TO WIN THIS THING.

39:28.430 --> 39:29.772
- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT,
RIGHT?

39:29.880 --> 39:31.017
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.633
- YOU EITHER.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.150
- WELL, YOU MADE THE CHOICE.

39:34.260 --> 39:37.195
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR THAT.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.029
YOU STUCK TO YOUR GUNS.

39:39.130 --> 39:40.222
YOU DIDN'T GO FOR THE JUGULAR

39:40.340 --> 39:43.503
EVEN THOUGH HEATHER AND I WERE
BOTH TELLING YOU TO DO THAT.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.645
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
- THANKS.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.920
- I'M NOT JUST SAYING
ALL THIS

39:47.030 --> 39:48.304
'CAUSE YOU MADE ME
LOOK LIKE A BADASS.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.820
- YOU ARE A BADASS.

39:50.940 --> 39:52.658
- I'M NOT A BADASS, KRISTINA.
- YOU'RE A BADASS.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.625
- I'M NOT.
I'M JUST A MAN, OKAY?

39:54.730 --> 39:57.312
SOMETIMES A MAN NEEDS TO KICK
A LITTLE ASS

39:57.420 --> 39:59.559
WHEN SOMEBODY'S ASS
NEEDS KICKING.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.945
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- OKAY.

40:02.050 --> 40:05.224
- AND YOU ARE A GOOD DAD.
- THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.150
- AND THE BEST HUSBAND.
- I LOVE YOU.

[vibrating]

40:08.610 --> 40:09.360
- GOSH.
SHE SCARES ME.

40:09.470 --> 40:13.748
SHE NEVER TEXTS
WHEN IT'S GOOD--

40:13.850 --> 40:16.922
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HER
YOU NEED 15 MINUTES.

40:17.030 --> 40:18.884
WHAT IS IT?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.230
- DROPPED FOUR POINTS.

40:21.340 --> 40:23.968
UM...

40:24.070 --> 40:24.820
- OKAY.

40:24.930 --> 40:26.340
- TRAINING BY SIX.
- THAT'S OKAY.

40:26.450 --> 40:28.099
YOU TOLD ME
THAT THESE THINGS

40:28.210 --> 40:29.905
HAVE A MARGIN OF ERROR, RIGHT?

40:30.010 --> 40:31.864
BY A COUPLE POINTS,
SO YOU COULD HAVE JUST DROPPED

40:31.980 --> 40:33.140
A POINT OR TWO, AND THAT COULD
JUST BE A LITTLE FLUCTUATION.

40:33.250 --> 40:37.016
DOESN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY
DO WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.566
- RIGHT.

40:39.670 --> 40:43.151
- KRISTINA,
YOU CAN WIN THIS THING.

40:43.260 --> 40:46.332
- RIGHT.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.338
[doorbell rings]

40:47.440 --> 40:48.919
- EXCUSE ME.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.191
COMING.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.334
- HI.
- HI.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.998
- YOU'RE NOT MY SUPER.
- [laughs]

40:55.100 --> 40:56.476
- COME IN.
- THANKS.

40:56.590 --> 40:59.206
- SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

40:59.310 --> 41:01.483
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.319
- CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

41:03.420 --> 41:06.105
- UM, YES, SURE,
IN A MINUTE.

41:06.220 --> 41:07.664
- OKAY.
- I DON'T KNOW.

41:07.770 --> 41:08.520
- COME ON IN.
MEET SOME PEOPLE.

41:08.630 --> 41:10.518
UH, ALEX,
CAN I INTERRUPT YOU?

41:10.640 --> 41:12.016
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
YES, HI.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.701
- ALEX SAMSON,
MEET SARAH BRAVERMAN.

41:13.810 --> 41:15.630
- HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.879
- SARAH IS A REALLY TALENTED
PHOTOGRAPHER.

41:17.990 --> 41:18.888
- OH, WHAT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHY?

41:18.990 --> 41:21.959
- UH, DOGS AND CATS.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:22.060 --> 41:24.290
WE ONCE HAD A WEGMAN EXHIBIT.
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

41:24.410 --> 41:25.570
- THAT WAS GREAT.
I SAW THAT TOO.

41:25.690 --> 41:27.408
- YES, HUH-HUH.
- WOW.
