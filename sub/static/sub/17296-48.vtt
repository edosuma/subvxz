Titans!

00:24.763 --> 00:28.289
I have some alarming news
regarding tuna fish.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.205
These filthy creatures
are infested with mercury.

00:32.815 --> 00:35.165
We'll get our omega-3
fatty acids elsewhere, you...

00:44.131 --> 00:46.437
Beast Boy, stop clawing
the upholstery.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.091
No demons in the Tower, Raven.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.399
Cyborg, Starfire,
stop drawing on the window!

00:53.140 --> 00:55.925
Relax, dude,
the ink isn't permanent.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.972
See? All the gone.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.155
Ow! What's your problem, brah?

01:09.982 --> 01:13.247
Sorry, but you guys really
bring out the worst in me.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.683
Yeah, we do!

01:14.726 --> 01:16.163
You say that like
it's a good thing.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.468
Oh, but it is.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.253
Do you not remember how you were

01:19.296 --> 01:21.342
before we brought out
the worst in you?

01:21.385 --> 01:23.996
Back when the Teen Titans
first came to be.

01:24.562 --> 01:27.826
Flashback, brah...

01:33.005 --> 01:35.660
Gee whillikers, I thought
Gotham was crummy,

01:35.704 --> 01:38.141
but Jump City
really takes the cake.

01:38.185 --> 01:41.536
Good thing that Robin, the
Boy Wonder, is on the case.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.853
Hold it right there, evildoer!

01:56.681 --> 01:58.683
Golly, that rung my bell.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.385
Not so fast, you overgrown
wad of chewing gum!

02:05.342 --> 02:08.128
Oh, daisies, what a wallop!

02:08.171 --> 02:09.129
Freeze!

02:10.521 --> 02:12.306
Halt!

02:12.349 --> 02:14.438
Cease!

02:14.482 --> 02:18.703
Gosh, Jump City is too rough
for this wonderful boy alone.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.357
"Alone." That's it!

02:20.401 --> 02:24.709
If I could assemble a super
team of super teens like me,

02:24.753 --> 02:26.450
we could bring peace
to Jump City,

02:26.494 --> 02:28.800
while bringing out
the best in each other.

02:28.844 --> 02:32.239
And we'd call ourselves
"the Teen Titans."

02:37.331 --> 02:40.899
Hey there, Kid Flash.
Wanna join my superhero team?

02:40.943 --> 02:42.901
We'll bring peace
to Jump City while...

02:42.945 --> 02:45.469
Hang on. Had to stop
a bank robbery in Canada.

02:45.513 --> 02:50.257
Whoa! I've never seen anyone
beat feet like you, Kid Flash.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.868
You've got to join.
Tryouts are tomorrow.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.784
Ah, well, tryouts
aren't really my thing.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.394
It's just a formality for you.

02:57.438 --> 03:01.181
I guarantee you'll be
on the team, pal. No foolin'.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.486
Okay.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.272
Hot dog! I'll go
get some more recruits.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.664
Yo, can I get one of those?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.188
You're a superhero?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.233
No, just a regular dude
named Victor.

03:11.930 --> 03:15.673
Sorry, Vic, but the tryouts
are for superheroes only.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.449
Ouch!

03:55.322 --> 03:57.498
Ah! Ow! Ouch! Ow! Stop!

04:00.414 --> 04:01.458
What? No...

04:05.723 --> 04:07.464
Fear me, mere mortals,

04:07.508 --> 04:10.467
for I am Raven, daughter
of Trigon the Terrible.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.121
Excuse me, would you...

04:12.164 --> 04:15.429
Can I just... Please...

04:15.472 --> 04:17.300
Stop with the magic!

04:17.344 --> 04:20.216
Oh, boy. Lost my cool there.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.871
Uh, now, what's with
all the wanton destruction?

04:22.914 --> 04:25.656
Ugh, my dad is making me
take over the planet.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.877
I know, Dad! Sheesh.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.446
Say, you should be using those spooky
moves for good instead of evil.

04:32.489 --> 04:35.971
A superhero, huh?
My dad wouldn't like that.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.366
Stop that!

04:39.409 --> 04:42.369
I mean, see you at tryouts.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.546
I'll take one of those.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.287
You've got no chance, pal.

04:50.246 --> 04:53.423
Here, the kitty, the kitty, the kitty.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.296
Wowzer. When I was tracking
an alien life-form here,

04:56.339 --> 04:59.211
I wasn't expecting
to find one so beautiful.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.351
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.485
I was just attempting to recover
this wonderful kitten-cat.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.405
Don't let me stop you.
I can wait.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.887
Oh, you are the chubby one,
you are the perfect.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.455
Oh, yes, you are.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.587
Mmm!

05:26.630 --> 05:28.458
Get that cat
out of your mouth, now!

05:32.419 --> 05:35.596
Ooh, sorry I blew my stack,
miss, but cats aren't food.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.946
I believe you are mistaken.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.427
My wisecracking
TV alien friend told me

05:40.470 --> 05:42.951
that cats are
Earth's finest delicacy.

05:42.994 --> 05:47.695
And one does not disregard the advice
of the wisecracking TV alien friend.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.175
Get it out of your mouth!
Cats are pets!

05:50.219 --> 05:51.699
Now, love it.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.875
Give it kisses.
Scratch behind the ears!

05:53.918 --> 05:55.442
Do that little thing
where it starts to purr.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.619
I see now.

05:58.662 --> 06:03.188
Oh, cats are the sweet,
but not to eat.

06:03.232 --> 06:06.409
Groovy. Oh, and join
my superhero team!

06:07.758 --> 06:09.281
Now can I get one?

06:09.325 --> 06:11.153
It would be a waste
of everyone's time.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.638
Good thing there's nothing out
here to impede our perfect getaway.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.122
Wow, a shape-shifter!

06:24.166 --> 06:25.515
You gotta join my team.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.343
Is there gonna be lunch?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
Lunch isn't provided.
Says right there on the flyer.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.352
I can'ts read, fool.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.747
Now, I's a vegan, so I don't
eats no meats or dairies.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.183
Again, there is no food.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.532
Cool, cool, cool. All right.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.447
Nothing that
comes from an animal,

06:44.491 --> 06:47.450
so, mostly veggies
and whole grains.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.451
There's no lunch!

06:48.495 --> 06:50.540
Oh, golly.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.673
What's gotten into me today?

06:52.716 --> 06:55.545
Probably you is irritable 'cause you
gots a bad diet of meats and such things.

06:55.589 --> 06:58.505
Thanks for the health tip.
I'll see you at tryouts.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.724
How about now?
Can I get one now?

07:00.768 --> 07:02.596
Okay, fine! You can try out!

07:02.639 --> 07:04.728
Are you happy now?

07:04.772 --> 07:06.251
Jeepers.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.644
So sorry, didn't mean
to snap at you.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.472
I'm not sure what got into me.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.995
See you at tryouts, Vic.

07:12.257 --> 07:16.174
Welcome, everyone,
to the Teen Titans tryouts.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.524
Especially you, Kid Flash.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.612
Pew-pew.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.396
Oh, and pew-pew to you, too.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.486
Today's tryouts will
require skill and speed,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.619
combat and teamwork.

07:25.662 --> 07:29.144
Those of you who make the cut will be
full-fledged members of the Teen Titans.

07:29.187 --> 07:32.669
And we'll live here
in Titans Tower.

07:32.713 --> 07:36.499
Now, if there aren't any questions,
let's get this tryout started.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.762
Yo, where's that lunch
you promised, exactly?

07:38.806 --> 07:40.460
- I didn't...
- There's lunch?

07:40.503 --> 07:41.678
Cool. I could eat.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.724
Can we please focus
on the tryouts, gang?

07:43.767 --> 07:46.640
I ain'ts trying out for
nothing on an empty stomach.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.293
Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

07:48.337 --> 07:50.687
Lunch! Lunch!
Lunch! Lunch!

07:50.731 --> 07:53.690
There's no lunch! No lunch!
It says on the flyer!

07:53.734 --> 07:56.737
Wow. You know, you just
kind of lost it there.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.521
It's not exactly
a great trait for a leader.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.131
Ah, gee whillikers.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.742
You're absolutely right.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.527
It's just, these four
really get under my skin.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.791
Wait, so you're saying,
no lunch?

08:07.835 --> 08:09.967
It is good then
that I brought my own.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.843
Your wisecracking TV alien
friend is not to be trusted!

08:16.974 --> 08:19.716
Now, to the speed challenge.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.544
You're up, Kid Flash.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.939
On your mark, get set, proceed!

08:24.982 --> 08:26.288
Gee-whiz.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.899
You're next, Vic.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.554
On your mark, get set, begin!

08:34.339 --> 08:36.907
I just gotta get
a second wind, and...

08:42.478 --> 08:43.914
Next up, combat.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.612
Go ahead and attack
the dummy, Raven.

08:45.655 --> 08:46.917
Okay.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.268
Please!

08:51.922 --> 08:53.750
Why? No!

08:53.794 --> 08:55.709
How was that?

08:58.712 --> 09:02.454
For the final exercise, I'll be
judging your ability to work as a team

09:02.498 --> 09:04.500
and bring out the best
in each other.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.765
You'll need to work together
to solve a puzzle.

09:10.332 --> 09:15.598
On your mark, get set,
construct.

09:15.642 --> 09:20.429
I can tell you all know that
teamwork makes the dream work.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.562
Edge pieces, man.
I need edge pieces!

09:22.605 --> 09:25.086
Yo, mama, my mans
needs the edge pieces.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.914
You ruined my puzzle.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.872
Now I'll ruin you!

09:30.308 --> 09:33.181
Ooh, are we doing
the combat portion again?

09:38.447 --> 09:40.231
Stop it!
You're ruining everything.

09:40.275 --> 09:43.321
Who behaves like this?
What is wrong with you people?

09:47.935 --> 09:49.545
Stop!

09:52.722 --> 09:55.246
Did I make the team, Coach?

09:55.290 --> 09:57.292
No, you did not make the team!

09:57.335 --> 10:00.817
I never should have asked you
in the first place!

10:00.861 --> 10:02.863
Now, get out. All of you!

10:02.906 --> 10:04.908
- We ain'ts even got no lunch.
- Oh, man...

10:04.952 --> 10:07.389
Guess I'll go
enslave the universe then.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.262
Phew.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.049
Well, I guess that settles it.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.877
Welcome to the team, gang.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.966
Hey, Robin, sorry to interrupt,
but can we have a quick vote?

10:19.009 --> 10:21.838
Sure thing, Kid Flash. We live
in a democracy, after all.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.797
Thank you.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.886
Now, during the tryouts, Robin's
shown himself to have a real temper,

10:25.929 --> 10:27.496
so raise your hand if you think
we should kick him off the team

10:27.539 --> 10:28.758
and I should be the leader.

10:31.152 --> 10:35.069
But you were barely interested
in the team in the first place.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.027
And I was the one
who put it together.

10:37.071 --> 10:40.248
Thanks for that, buddy.
But I'll take it from here.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.554
Gee whillikers.
