03:09.322 --> 03:11.734
<i>The world is ﬁlled with
all kinds of animals.</i>

03:12.459 --> 03:15.303
But the strangest species

03:15.429 --> 03:17.272
<i>is the human being.</i>

03:19.299 --> 03:22.405
<i>Time just flows for the
rest of the creatures...</i>

03:23.570 --> 03:27.416
<i>But human beings divide
it into years, months, days</i>

03:27.741 --> 03:29.243
<i>and make calendars.</i>

03:32.646 --> 03:35.525
<i>They claim you can? turn back time.</i>

03:36.016 --> 03:39.395
<i>And they also say my
birthday has come again.</i>

03:40.687 --> 03:42.257
<i>Whether time can turn back or not</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:45.598
<i>all the special
occasions of human beings</i>

03:45.726 --> 03:48.366
<i>take a u-tum and
come back each year.</i>

03:50.230 --> 03:54.372
<i>Which brings us to these
hampers being packed.</i>

03:54.601 --> 03:57.309
<i>These are gifts as well as invitations</i>

03:57.437 --> 04:00.281
<i>for a 30th marriage anniversary.</i>

04:00.640 --> 04:04.087
<i>The 30th happy anniversary
of Mr. and Mrs. Mehra.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.555
<i>One of Delhi societys
most popular coup/es</i> -

04:08.415 --> 04:09.393
<i>The Mehras.</i>

04:14.054 --> 04:15.226
<i>This is Mr. Kama! Mehra.</i>

04:16.156 --> 04:17.293
<i>A successful businessman.</i> . .

04:17.557 --> 04:21.437
<i>who built his mighty
empire from scratch.</i>

04:22.362 --> 04:27.607
<i>A fact he repeats often,
incase anyone forgets it.</i>

04:28.368 --> 04:32.111
<i>Mr. Mehra is referred
to as</i> a <i>self made man.</i>

04:33.173 --> 04:36.450
One wonders that <i>if</i> people
can make themselves...

04:37.177 --> 04:38.383
then why dorft they make
themselves a <i>little</i> better?

04:39.713 --> 04:40.657
But what does one do?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.755
<i>These days, 'better' is not defined</i>

04:43.083 --> 04:44.790
<i>by intelligence, honesty or courage</i>

04:45.318 --> 04:46.319
<i>but by something else.</i>

04:47.320 --> 04:52.565
<i>H has to do with
something called money.</i>

04:55.162 --> 04:56.163
Nice putt Kamal!

04:57.230 --> 05:00.234
If only you had been this
precise with the Suri deal.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.612
You win some, you lose some, Lalit.

05:03.603 --> 05:07.278
Only a man nearing
the end does accounts.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.048
Come on!
Beer is on me.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.057
I have a lunch date with my wife...

05:16.516 --> 05:17.995
and I never keep a lady waiting.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.289
See you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.071
<i>This is his Wife, Neelam Mehra.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:33.209
<i>Mr. Mehra is hot having lunch
with her, she is just ah excuse.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.139
<i>In fact, they have not
lunched together in years.</i>

05:38.638 --> 05:41.414
<i>Their story was quite
romantic to begin with.</i>

05:42.142 --> 05:44.520
<i>18 year old Nee/am had run</i> away

05:44.744 --> 05:46.621
<i>and married</i> 22 <i>year old Kama].</i>

05:47.714 --> 05:51.127
<i>Over time, they found
unbelievable success.</i>

05:51.751 --> 05:54.129
<i>But lost each other along the way.</i>

05:55.555 --> 05:57.125
<i>Anyway, this is just
inside information.</i>

05:57.591 --> 06:01.004
<i>In front of the world,
theirs is</i> a <i>perfect marriage.</i>

06:01.595 --> 06:03.006
<i>An ideal couple.</i>

06:03.463 --> 06:06.569
You know na Kamal was in Taiwan
last week for some work...

06:06.967 --> 06:10.073
Guess who had a meeting
in Taiwan the same week?

06:10.503 --> 06:12.244
Don't tell me!
Radhikal?

06:12.272 --> 06:14.013
She’s such a number!

06:14.374 --> 06:15.478
And this Kamal...

06:16.076 --> 06:17.419
Why pack your pants

06:17.477 --> 06:19.354
when you aren’t going to wear them?!

06:23.550 --> 06:25.154
We were just talking
about you & Kamal.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.162
Really?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.221
It's so sweet of him
to plan a cruise.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.124
My husband doesn't even

06:30.190 --> 06:31.191
remember our anniversary.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.235
L-low do you remember your husband'?

06:38.765 --> 06:40.108
My maid's run away again.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.578
Again? What do you do with them?!

06:44.070 --> 06:45.048
Yes, Ayesha?

06:45.272 --> 06:47.274
Deeya aunty still hasn’t confirmed...

06:48.775 --> 06:51.688
I know, mom
but we can’t keep the room on hold.

06:52.779 --> 06:53.689
Nice card...

06:55.048 --> 06:57.255
To celebrate 3O years
of Kamal and Neelam,

06:57.317 --> 06:58.295
we wish you to join us

06:58.351 --> 07:00.331
for a 1O day cruise
of Turkey and Greece.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.964
Just like our lives, this journey

07:02.022 --> 07:03.092
won't be the same without you.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.165
Kabir Ivlehra.

07:10.964 --> 07:11.704
Ayesha Mehra. ..

07:12.532 --> 07:14.136
<i>Neeiam and KamaPs ﬁrst born.</i>

07:15.001 --> 07:18.346
<i>But her name is not on the
invite alongside her brotnefs.</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:20.012
<i>Why would it be?</i>

07:21.308 --> 07:23.686
<i>The tradition of our nation
is that after marriage</i>

07:23.743 --> 07:26.519
<i>the daughter belongs
to another family.</i>

07:27.580 --> 07:29.560
<i>The son could have umpteen marriages</i>

07:29.716 --> 07:31.024
<i>he will always remain our own.</i>

07:31.451 --> 07:33.590
<i>And so, 21 years after her birth,</i>

07:33.720 --> 07:37.065
<i>Ayesha was married and
shipped off to Mumbai</i>

07:37.757 --> 07:43.173
<i>to lead</i> a <i>life like all
girls in these circumstances.</i>

07:44.331 --> 07:46.743
<i>But Ayesha is not
typical of the female ilk.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:48.704
<i>Soon after her wedding,</i>

07:49.369 --> 07:52.248
<i>she started her business
- An onHne travel portal.</i>

07:53.440 --> 07:57.445
<i>Today, she is the
2nd biggest in the market.</i>

07:58.745 --> 08:01.692
<i>Just like her father,
she too is self made.</i>

08:03.016 --> 08:05.428
<i>The difference is, she doesrft say it.</i>

08:17.631 --> 08:19.474
<i>And here We have Kabir Mehra,</i>

08:20.166 --> 08:23.113
<i>the youngest member
of the Mehra family.</i>

08:23.603 --> 08:28.109
<i>The male child, or rather Gocfs gift.</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:30.154
<i>After all, he will
carry on the family name.</i>

08:33.413 --> 08:35.552
<i>Just last Week, he turned 25.</i>

08:36.649 --> 08:38.322
<i>The apple of his motheﬁs eye</i>

08:38.618 --> 08:41.565
<i>and the sole heir to
his fathefs empire.</i>

08:43.690 --> 08:46.170
So <i>we have</i> a <i>prince
and we have</i> a <i>throne.</i>

08:47.060 --> 08:49.700
<i>But is that enough?</i>

08:51.064 --> 08:56.241
<i>Only time will tell if this prince
is worthy of the throne or hot.</i>

08:59.506 --> 09:00.450
And there you have it, folks.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.115
I think it’s sufficiently clear
that we can together deliver

09:04.177 --> 09:06.555
a high quality product
for the South Asian market-

09:06.613 --> 09:09.219
And how will you compete
with Chinese products'?

09:11.451 --> 09:12.293
Well I don’t think

09:12.952 --> 09:15.694
that is a concern for us.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.629
After all, our quality is higher
and price lower.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.602
These prices are only possible

09:20.660 --> 09:22.469
if the production
costs and selling price

09:22.529 --> 09:24.202
function on these numbers.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.035
The Indian rupee keeps fluctuating.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
Where is the contingency
plan for that?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.709
If the dollar rises

09:32.972 --> 09:35.680
raw material costs will also increase.

09:36.709 --> 09:37.551
Isn't that right'?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.629
Actually, you are totally right

09:46.352 --> 09:48.354
we should have factored that in.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.569
You will get our revised
proposal by tomorrow.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.399
You’re right.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.169
Anything can happen.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.536
Don’t you have elections
in Sri Lanka ne><t year?

09:59.999 --> 10:01.342
The policy could change

10:01.634 --> 10:03.045
with a new government.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.543
And then the tax concessions

10:04.604 --> 10:06.140
you have committed to us

10:06.706 --> 10:07.480
may also change.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.583
We must factor that in too.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.087
You're absolutely right, Mr. Mehra

10:13.379 --> 10:14.289
As usual.

11:53.179 --> 11:53.782
Oh my god!

11:54.080 --> 11:56.321
I love that picture of Pluto
you put up yesterday.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.486
Isn't it the best?

11:57.650 --> 11:58.492
He's so cute.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.460
Whafs Pluto?

11:59.819 --> 12:00.354
It's a planet.

12:02.222 --> 12:02.666
It was.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.266
Was...

12:06.426 --> 12:07.427
Pluto is our doggie.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.672
Pluto is our brother.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.073
Brother...

12:10.196 --> 12:11.368
Does he look like you?

12:13.132 --> 12:14.736
Why didn’t anyone tell me

12:15.001 --> 12:16.503
lvlanav’s cousin is so cute?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.048
You're really stupid!

12:19.138 --> 12:20.446
When are you going
back to Delhi, Kabir?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.379
Tomorrow, after the meeting.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.553
Why? What is the hurry?

12:29.616 --> 12:31.061
Stay another day na.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.488
Do you still ride that plane?

12:32.552 --> 12:33.758
I even fly it now, Aunty.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.198
You had promised me you'll come.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.031
then what happened?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.126
How?

12:39.592 --> 12:40.570
I have vertigo.

12:41.194 --> 12:41.763
In any case...

12:42.195 --> 12:44.766
if I leave for even a day
this house falls apart.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.446
I heard
dad is selling the plane?

12:50.036 --> 12:51.413
Yes...

12:52.405 --> 12:53.383
Don’t remind me.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.646
I may jump off from here.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.418
Ayesha, please work out a way

12:57.477 --> 12:58.581
that he doesn’t have to sell it.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.056
Kabir!

13:00.079 --> 13:02.457
I know this plane is
your one true love,

13:02.515 --> 13:05.325
but Ayka needs an asset reduction.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.363
It's a dead investment.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.261
You know...

13:07.620 --> 13:08.997
When I got married,

13:09.522 --> 13:12.230
I was so shy in front of my in-laws.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.562
Forget talking about business.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.238
I could hardly say 'yesfi 'no'.

13:19.198 --> 13:22.611
But how times have changed...

13:24.370 --> 13:26.043
Mom tell us that story,

13:26.506 --> 13:28.281
when you met the Maharaja of Jodhpur.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.552
You know...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.384
Even Kabir felt my name
should have been on the card.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.350
Aysh...
The invitation was from the ivlehras.

13:35.748 --> 13:36.692
You're not a Ivlehra anymore.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.592
You are a Sangha.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.733
And please tell Kabir...

13:44.323 --> 13:45.768
how was he behaving with Nitya'?

13:46.726 --> 13:47.727
They are not kids.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.364
I know.
But she is my cousin

13:49.662 --> 13:50.470
and your brother...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.299
spoilt brat!

13:56.102 --> 13:59.379
<i>Brat or not, Kabir is my best friend.</i>

14:00.173 --> 14:01.311
We met 5 years ago

14:01.975 --> 14:03.511
<i>and have been inseparable since.</i>

14:05.511 --> 14:07.491
<i>Oh great... I forgot
to introduce myself.</i>

14:09.082 --> 14:10.755
<i>After all, even l
belong to this family.</i>

14:12.218 --> 14:13.390
<i>Hello, handsome!</i>

14:13.419 --> 14:15.228
<i>And at the risk of sounding impolite</i>

14:15.288 --> 14:18.633
<i>if anyone in this family is normal,</i>

14:19.258 --> 14:20.100
<i>it is me...</i>

14:20.660 --> 14:21.468
<i>Pluto Mehra.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:26.343
Ayesha is upset

14:26.366 --> 14:27.538
her name was not on the card.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.506
L-low was your meeting'?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.378
Papa did everything on Skype.

14:35.108 --> 14:35.552
Awww

14:36.342 --> 14:38.447
l-low modest my baby is!

14:38.544 --> 14:39.784
Just like Mama.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.062
I don’t think Ayka needs me.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.295
What do you mean?

14:51.457 --> 14:52.697
The company is for you.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.569
You’re our son...
who else will manage it?

14:56.028 --> 14:56.563
I don’t know.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.668
Maybe Papa can find
someone more qualified.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.482
What is the matter?

15:07.440 --> 15:07.747
Here.

15:09.175 --> 15:09.710
It's diet.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.478
There is no such thing

15:11.544 --> 15:12.454
don’t lie.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.516
You want cheese toast?

15:15.181 --> 15:16.353
Hot chocolate fudge from Nirula's?

15:16.482 --> 15:18.086
Are you even listening to me?

15:26.492 --> 15:28.199
I don’t think I belong here.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.170
If you didn’t belong here

15:35.234 --> 15:36.679
why would you be born here?

15:39.572 --> 15:41.313
This 'mummy' logic ma...

15:42.475 --> 15:42.782
<i>Okay . ....</i>

15:43.309 --> 15:45.482
If you could wish for
one thing right now

15:46.145 --> 15:47.021
what would it be?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.756
Anything.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.162
Anything, tell me?

15:54.153 --> 15:55.757
I wish dad vvasn’t selling the plane.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.442
It's so oily.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.578
L-low can anyone eat this'?

16:19.178 --> 16:21.158
What else is there?
- Just this.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.994
Just this?
- Great. Thank you.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.423
Sunil!
- Yes, sir?

16:27.019 --> 16:27.690
Get some fruit.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.663
I've told you to tell
them in the morning

16:34.694 --> 16:35.672
what you want to eat.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.700
It's not just about me.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.610
You think you should be eating this?

16:41.367 --> 16:42.402
Good luck with your weight loss.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.683
Pass the yoghurt.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.552
Ayesha is upset
her name is not on the card.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.195
Oh ya?

17:02.221 --> 17:04.064
She did all the planning, not me.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.564
If we put Ayesha’s name on the card

17:06.626 --> 17:07.661
then we'll have to put Manavs as well

17:07.727 --> 17:08.704
and then everyone will think

17:09.395 --> 17:10.669
he is paying for the cruise.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.137
It's confusing.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.979
I told you she’d be upset.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.372
Then talk to her...

17:19.739 --> 17:20.580
<i>Mother India.</i>

17:21.040 --> 17:22.144
Guys please.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.265
I am selling some of my shares.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.429
What?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.339
I need to buy something.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.305
Oh really!

17:46.432 --> 17:48.503
Those Louis Vuitton bags
and shoes aren’t enough?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.604
Now you need to own their company?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.581
I want to buy my son a gift
if you don’t mind?!

17:54.173 --> 17:56.380
What gift?
- The plane you are selling.

17:57.043 --> 17:57.384
Mom!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.359
Have you no shame?

18:03.950 --> 18:04.724
I didn’t say anything.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.428
Whafs wrong with you, Kabir?
- Just leave him out of this.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.227
At your age
I used to take a bus to work.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.959
On foot, when I had no money.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.204
The soles of my shoes would wear out!

18:14.360 --> 18:16.237
I've worked very hard, Kabir-

18:16.629 --> 18:17.607
Really? Then?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.369
V\/e’ve never heard this story before.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.382
And you?
You want to buy our plane from us?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.516
You are a genius, Neelam.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.516
They are my shares.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.619
I'll do what I want
with my money, okay.

18:32.011 --> 18:32.580
Your money?

18:33.579 --> 18:35.650
You only have this money
because I earned it.

18:36.115 --> 18:36.616
Me!

18:36.716 --> 18:38.753
And I supported you.
- Shut up okay.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.322
Don’t talk to me like this.

18:41.053 --> 18:46.401
<i>Human beings are
blessed with language.</i>

18:47.493 --> 18:51.305
<i>H is a gift that enab§es
them to clearly express</i>

18:52.064 --> 18:56.376
<i>their thoughts, ideas and emotions.</i>

18:58.237 --> 19:02.413
<i>But the irony is that
in spite of this power,</i>

19:02.675 --> 19:04.712
<i>the acute lack of
understanding between them,</i>

19:05.244 --> 19:07.121
<i>will not be found in mute animals.</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:13.395
<i>If there can be so much
misunderstanding in one nuclear family,</i>

19:13.519 --> 19:18.559
how can one even hope for world peace?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.204
What is this, Amrish?

19:24.964 --> 19:26.602
If I hadn’t come for a random check

19:27.566 --> 19:29.068
you vvoulcfve shipped these off?

19:30.569 --> 19:31.513
ls this Ayka’s finish?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.015
You're the supervisor.
Is this how you supervise'?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.150
<i>Bhai Saab...</i>

19:40.479 --> 19:41.480
I heard from the bank.

19:42.281 --> 19:42.759
Bad news.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.727
They are not willing
to take any more risks.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.052
The account is already overdrawn.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.088
And everyone we owe
money to is calling.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.028
Shit.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.762
L-low can they do this'?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.472
25 years we've been
working with them...

19:57.396 --> 19:58.568
This is how they
value our relationship'?

19:59.732 --> 20:00.506
What do they want?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.111
Should I put up a hoarding?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.680
That Ayka is bankrupt!

20:06.372 --> 20:07.715
I can delay it.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.781
But vve’|| have to pay up. What to do...

20:30.496 --> 20:31.338
Everything is okay...

20:33.499 --> 20:34.273
I am okay.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.275
I am okay.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.345
Oh, Kamal will be so upset.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.377
We'll miss you guys...

20:42.708 --> 20:43.482
I'll tell him.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.315
I'll tell him.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.422
Okay.
Bye... Bye..-

20:50.783 --> 20:51.761
The Kumars are not coming.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.227
Good.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.665
<i>8,000 Euros saved.</i>

20:59.058 --> 21:00.503
Do you have to be so crude?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.129
The company is bleeding.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.304
Interest is mounting by the day.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.043
So forgive me for being crude.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.459
Prem thinks I should talk to Lalit.

21:27.019 --> 21:27.690
Lalit Sood?

21:28.788 --> 21:29.732
You're selling shares?

21:32.258 --> 21:33.236
For partnership?

21:35.361 --> 21:36.431
49%.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.667
He has deep pockets.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.744
You have to be at an advantage
with a man like Lalit.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.085
Give him something he needs...

21:50.242 --> 21:51.186
But what?

21:52.611 --> 21:54.113
That bastard has everything.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.792
Except a
son-in-law.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.061
His daughter Noorie. ..

22:00.419 --> 22:02.126
Her engagement broke up. I told you.

22:02.988 --> 22:03.557
Why, what did she do?

22:04.356 --> 22:06.097
Who cares!

22:06.192 --> 22:07.466
She is Lalit Soocfs only heir.

22:10.729 --> 22:11.605
Does Kabir know her?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.335
They must have met socially.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.343
What are you thinking?

22:28.447 --> 22:29.323
Kabir and Noorie?

22:35.121 --> 22:36.498
No, actually... it's not a bad idea.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.671
<i>Anyway Nahwa Soot) must be</i>

22:41.760 --> 22:42.761
quite desperate these days.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.073
Should I invite them?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.080
What about Vinod?

22:53.739 --> 22:55.309
If we call them Vinod will get upset.

22:56.809 --> 22:57.719
Don’t worry about him...

22:59.178 --> 23:00.384
He survived a heart attack.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.158
He’|| live through this too.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.496
Hi Naina!

23:07.520 --> 23:08.430
L-low are you'?

23:09.121 --> 23:10.099
Very well...

23:10.756 --> 23:12.429
Okay, I've called to invite you...

23:12.725 --> 23:14.227
it's our wedding anniversary

23:14.393 --> 23:15.428
and we are going for a cruise.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.435
And we'd love you all to join us.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.172
Ayesha Didi!

23:25.237 --> 23:26.215
Coming!

23:28.107 --> 23:29.643
Welcome!
- Hello, darling!

23:31.210 --> 23:32.553
Hi, Saira Aunty!
- Hey boy!

23:48.160 --> 23:48.661
Come on!

24:09.748 --> 24:11.557
Pluto Ivlehra.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.130
Come to me...
Why is he on the leash?

24:14.186 --> 24:17.167
Ship rules...
- Sorry Pluto!

24:18.123 --> 24:19.067
Great show Kabir.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.233
Congratulate Ayesha, Jamaal uncle.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.438
It's all her doing.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.172
Your sister is a genius...

24:26.165 --> 24:28.736
Forbes magazines top 1O entrepreneurs.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.239
Congratulations, Kamal.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.011
Next year it'll be my son.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.615
He just cracked an
incredible deal in Ivlumbai.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.283
You should have seen him, Jamaal...

24:40.145 --> 24:41.089
He was a tiger!

24:41.213 --> 24:41.782
Really?

24:42.581 --> 24:43.651
Good job, Kabir.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.558
Proud of you!

24:46.785 --> 24:49.197
You have completely
forgotten Delhi and all of us.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.800
Not at all, Amrish uncle!

24:51.624 --> 24:53.399
You must come more often.

24:53.525 --> 24:54.469
Of course I will.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.265
But I'm really happy that you are here.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.210
Kamal Ji personally invited Sunny & me.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.243
I had to come.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.302
I hope Sunny comes too.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.043
L-low many change of
clothes have you brought'?

25:06.972 --> 25:07.416
25.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.049
Should be enough no?

25:09.241 --> 25:10.652
The Chaddhas are upset

25:10.709 --> 25:12.313
they were not invited.

25:12.378 --> 25:13.618
Aren’t they your friends lndu?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.724
Everyone can’t be invited.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.085
They invited the dog.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.628
He is better behaved than the Chaddas.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.597
Naina! Hello!
- Oh my god!

25:22.654 --> 25:24.600
So glad you all could make it.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.197
What are they doing here?

25:27.293 --> 25:28.397
Welcome aboard, Lalit.

25:31.997 --> 25:32.634
This is amazing, Kamal.

25:33.098 --> 25:33.667
Impressive.

25:33.999 --> 25:34.670
Hello, Kamal.

25:35.434 --> 25:36.071
L-low are you'?

25:36.435 --> 25:37.413
Top of the world, as usual.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.209
Noorie!

25:39.738 --> 25:41.581
She was so little when I last saw her.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.182
Right, Neelu?

25:43.442 --> 25:44.386
Come let's have a drink.

25:44.443 --> 25:45.353
I'll just join you in a second...

25:45.411 --> 25:46.549
Come come... Please come...

25:48.347 --> 25:49.348
it's not easy.

25:49.681 --> 25:50.489
But he'll learn.

25:50.649 --> 25:51.286
Prem...

25:51.684 --> 25:52.424
Listen...

25:53.619 --> 25:54.563
Lalit Sood is here.

25:55.421 --> 25:56.593
Give him the best suite.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.335
These should be no issues.
No screw ups, okay?

26:01.160 --> 26:01.968
What are you waiting for?

26:01.994 --> 26:02.472
Go!

26:05.130 --> 26:06.370
What is this, Papa?

26:06.665 --> 26:08.372
Why do you talk to Prem uncle in this tone?

26:08.434 --> 26:10.107
He’s your brother, not your assistant.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.412
Don't be silly.

26:13.005 --> 26:13.710
I think you need a drink.

26:14.273 --> 26:14.683
Come.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.418
We all were worried about you.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.121
Good to see you back in action, Sir.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.055
It's gods grace

26:21.113 --> 26:22.353
that I got luckys.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.321
You never know with the heart.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.186
I just got an ECG done.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.993
Where did you do it?
- In Bombay.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.467
Let me know if you ever need a bypass.
Very good

26:33.192 --> 26:35.536
Did you know Kamal
had invited the Soods?

26:35.761 --> 26:36.603
<i>Seeds?</i>

26:47.072 --> 26:49.245
<i>They say dogs have</i> a
<i>strong sense of smell.</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:52.555
<i>But when it comes to sniffing out trouble,</i>

26:53.045 --> 26:54.649
<i>humans aren‘t far behind.</i>

26:59.718 --> 27:02.597
<i>Not only do they anticipate
danger in advance,</i>

27:03.121 --> 27:05.658
<i>they even plan their response to it.</i>

27:07.192 --> 27:11.038
<i>Ironically, the biggest
threat to</i> a <i>human being</i>

27:11.096 --> 27:12.734
<i>is another human being.</i>

27:13.465 --> 27:14.739
<i>To shield them selves,</i>

27:15.000 --> 27:19.005
<i>they change their coiour
to suit their environment.</i>

27:19.671 --> 27:24.586
<i>And they become</i>
a <i>bit like shame/eons.</i>

27:26.278 --> 27:26.983
<i>For instance,</i>

27:27.613 --> 27:31.390
<i>Vinod Khanna and LaHt Sood
are shaking hands.</i>

27:32.985 --> 27:36.592
<i>When in reality, it is</i> a <i>show of strength.</i>

27:38.690 --> 27:42.536
<i>Their wives are exchanging smiles</i>

27:43.762 --> 27:47.073
<i>but it is a baring of fangs.</i>

27:48.600 --> 27:51.274
<i>Their children have been
instructed to keep</i> a <i>distance,</i>

27:52.237 --> 27:55.616
<i>but are actually sizing each other up.</i>

27:58.610 --> 28:02.114
<i>Pretension is</i> a <i>purely human trait.</i>

28:03.048 --> 28:06.996
<i>When others do it,
people ca" it hypocrisy.</i>

28:07.586 --> 28:11.659
<i>And</i> when they do <i>it</i> themselves,
they call <i>it</i> world/mess.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.662
<i>So ab' I can say is</i>

28:14.726 --> 28:18.264
<i>that Mr. and Mrs. Mehra
are very worldly people.</i>

28:31.209 --> 28:33.018
Attention attention...

28:36.481 --> 28:37.516
Today, all of you...

28:39.017 --> 28:40.155
my dear friends...

28:41.186 --> 28:42.221
are here tonight...

28:43.121 --> 28:44.122
What can I say.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.064
I feel on top of the world!

28:55.167 --> 28:56.407
Neelu, my beautiful wife...

28:57.469 --> 28:59.073
When I first met you,

29:00.038 --> 29:01.142
I was nothing.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.643
And even today, without you

29:04.610 --> 29:05.714
I'd be nothing.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.992
I can't say it enough...

29:09.414 --> 29:11.052
I love you, Neelu.

29:11.683 --> 29:14.027
Go for it!
That's my buddy!

29:16.588 --> 29:17.965
Touch wood, Vinod.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.528
God has been very kind.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.533
Our only wish is that

29:25.063 --> 29:26.007
our daughter...

29:27.599 --> 29:28.703
and our son-in-law. ..

29:31.303 --> 29:35.308
quickly give us a grandson!

29:40.179 --> 29:41.283
Cheers to that!

29:41.346 --> 29:42.586
Cheers!

29:43.281 --> 29:44.385
Come on lets have dinner!

29:45.751 --> 29:48.595
You know Vinod just had a heart attack.
- I know...

29:48.654 --> 29:51.157
If we knew the Soods are coming
we wouldn't come.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.663
Vandana aunty, it musfve
slipped Mamas mind...

29:54.593 --> 29:55.537
How?!

29:56.161 --> 29:58.141
Everyone knows our equation with the Soods.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.769
Vinod can’t stand Lalit Sood.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.171
Mom please take it easy...

30:02.234 --> 30:02.769
They’re standing right here.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.208
Rana, please!
Neelu shoulcfve told us.

30:05.437 --> 30:06.381
Now what have I done?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.712
You cou|d've made a little
more effort at your outfit.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.584
I did.
- It's not a big deal...

30:11.777 --> 30:14.018
I don’t get involved in
making these guest lists.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.251
Neelam looks into all that.

30:15.313 --> 30:15.757
<i>Kama . . ...</i>

30:16.615 --> 30:18.060
Don’t be formals.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.156
V\/e’ve been tolerating our
wives for so many years.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.062
We can tolerate the Soods for 2 weeks!

30:26.491 --> 30:27.469
<i>Omen mam!</i>

30:27.526 --> 30:28.527

Cheers!

30:31.463 --> 30:33.136
Come on Smita Ji, you must have a drink!

30:33.198 --> 30:34.199
Shall I get you a drink?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.137
I have arthritis.

30:36.234 --> 30:38.407
I can’t hold the glass for too long.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.149
I'll help you.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.209
I love this Neelam Aunty.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.479
This is so stunning!

30:44.543 --> 30:45.419
Thank you!

30:45.811 --> 30:47.188
My anniversary gift.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.286
WOW !

30:48.347 --> 30:50.384
Have you met Kabir?
- Yes.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.123
Kabir!

30:53.051 --> 30:53.654
Come here, son.

30:57.622 --> 30:58.464
Have you met Noorie?

30:58.724 --> 30:59.702
Yes... Hi.

31:00.058 --> 31:00.433
Hi...

31:01.093 --> 31:02.538
Now she's your responsibility...

31:03.128 --> 31:03.538
Have fun.

31:04.162 --> 31:04.663
Thank you.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.376
So vvhafs been up?

31:16.508 --> 31:17.282
Whafs been up?

31:20.045 --> 31:21.718
My fiancé left me at the altar.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.388
Everyone is laughing at my family

31:25.117 --> 31:26.619
and my mom blames me.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.659
But you already knew this?

31:31.189 --> 31:31.792
No.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.171
My fiancé Jai went to Goa-

31:39.264 --> 31:40.766
Ex-fiance...

31:42.334 --> 31:44.371
Ex-fiance, Jai...

31:45.037 --> 31:47.608
went to Goa for his bachelor trip.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.744
There he met a hippie, fell in love

31:51.343 --> 31:52.515
and that was that.

31:54.312 --> 31:55.256
That's rough.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.721
It was in the front page of the Delhi Times.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.161
Headlines...

32:03.755 --> 32:04.733
Noorie Sood...

32:06.425 --> 32:07.369
"Not so Hippie!"

32:26.011 --> 32:28.514
That boy Jai has turned us into a joke...

32:29.314 --> 32:30.622
That's just how people are.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.196
Look at some of my own friends...

32:34.086 --> 32:36.692
They love discussing
other peoples' problems.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.498
I'm having a 'Mata I<I Chowki' next month.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.765
Goofs given us just one daughter...

32:46.365 --> 32:48.072
Atleast now he should be kind.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.610
He was being kind.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.044
Let me tell you Naina...

32:53.772 --> 32:56.719
Noorie is meant to find
a better boy than Jai.

32:57.676 --> 32:58.654
Believe me.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.223
Dinner was great, haan?

33:05.083 --> 33:06.084
Did you try the prawns?

33:07.252 --> 33:08.356
They were fantastic!

33:19.264 --> 33:20.265
Did you notice...

33:21.366 --> 33:23.073
Noorie and Kabir were really bonding.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.007
Did Naina say anything to you?

33:29.341 --> 33:30.319
Relax...

33:31.209 --> 33:32.153
it's just been a day.

33:32.777 --> 33:33.414
Yes.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.523
Just one day...

33:42.354 --> 33:44.061
But ifs been 3O years for us.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.270
L-low time has flown...

33:55.767 --> 33:56.802
Why are you acting?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.146
No one is watching.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.420
<i>Okay. . ...</i>

34:27.498 --> 34:30.309
Everyone is saying how well
you planned this cruise.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.246
Congratulations.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.154
Your name shoulcfve been on that card.

34:41.545 --> 34:43.025
Why don’t you ever say anything?

34:43.648 --> 34:44.489
Please...

34:48.520 --> 34:50.022
Just order yourself another one...

34:50.088 --> 34:51.328
Why do you always eat from my bowl?

34:51.389 --> 34:52.663
Because you always get so irritated.

34:52.724 --> 34:53.668
Makes it more tasty!

34:56.728 --> 34:57.331
By the way--

34:57.596 --> 35:00.304
Jamaal uncle is super impressed
with your Forbes article.

35:04.970 --> 35:05.573
Really Aysh...

35:07.539 --> 35:09.314
What you have done with your company...

35:11.243 --> 35:12.483
I could never do it.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.191
Of course you can.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.249
And anyway...

35:17.549 --> 35:20.621
no one except Jamaal Uncle cares what I do.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.297
Everyone just wants me to have a baby.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.395
Ya, so that will happen too.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.533
It won’t...

35:33.765 --> 35:35.142
I'm on the pill.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.773
If you tell anyone I
swear to god I'll Kill you.

35:39.037 --> 35:39.777
You know that right?

35:41.139 --> 35:42.140
Ivlanav doesn’t know?

35:47.178 --> 35:48.122
Hello, Kabir...

35:48.180 --> 35:49.352
Big man!

35:49.481 --> 35:50.255
Hi...

35:52.551 --> 35:53.120
Uff!

35:53.685 --> 35:55.596
Look where your dog is sitting.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.099
Pluto shoo...

36:00.191 --> 36:00.635
Shoo...

36:03.461 --> 36:03.996
Shoo...

36:05.664 --> 36:06.574
Pluto off.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.139
Omon... Let's go for a swim.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.039
L-low can you allow him on the bed'?

36:11.102 --> 36:12.080
It's disgusting...

36:13.338 --> 36:15.545
Divorce! Divorce! Divorce!

36:17.175 --> 36:18.119
Bye, Kabir.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.150
Look at this dog hair...

36:22.380 --> 36:23.518
We are living in a kennel.

37:38.623 --> 37:39.567
Here we go...

37:40.325 --> 37:41.497
<i>A new story begins.</i>

37:42.761 --> 37:47.210
<i>This is cal/ed love at first sight.</i>

37:56.040 --> 37:57.678
<i>What is love at first sight?</i>

37:59.611 --> 38:00.954
You see someone,

38:02.047 --> 38:04.186
a <i>chemical reaction is
triggered in the brain,</i>

38:05.216 --> 38:07.526
<i>blood rushes faster through the veins,</i>

38:08.386 --> 38:10.525
a <i>tingling sensation
passes through the body...</i>

38:11.356 --> 38:13.632
<i>So your heartbeat increases.</i>

38:14.959 --> 38:16.063
<i>It's not visible,</i>

38:16.428 --> 38:19.966
<i>but the two of them are
experiencing all this right how.</i>

38:34.379 --> 38:35.323
<i>Look at that...</i>

38:36.047 --> 38:37.117
<i>When he comes here,</i>

38:37.382 --> 38:38.452
she goes there.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.054
<i>Even we may such
games in the beginning.</i>

38:53.098 --> 38:54.577
<i>At the start of</i> a <i>new Jove story,</i>

38:55.467 --> 38:57.469
one doesn’! really need speech...

38:58.570 --> 38:59.514
<i>The eyes talk...</i>

39:02.373 --> 39:03.351
<i>The body communicates.</i>

39:06.611 --> 39:08.352
<i>Neither you nor I heard a thing,</i>

39:09.381 --> 39:11.657
<i>but these two just had a conversation.</i>

39:14.219 --> 39:16.290
<i>Good Morning! This is your Captain speaking.</i>

39:16.554 --> 39:18.397
<i>We are approaching the port of Izmir</i>

39:18.456 --> 39:20.959
<i>and as predicted we shall arrive at Q</i> am...

39:27.465 --> 39:27.704
Please...

39:28.166 --> 39:28.610
Oh no, please!

39:29.000 --> 39:29.273
Go ahead.

39:30.268 --> 39:31.110
You were here first...

39:35.273 --> 39:35.614
Thank you.

39:36.074 --> 39:36.552
You’re welcome.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.713
This Rana Khanna is so smart...

39:47.018 --> 39:48.326
What are you are wearing?!

39:51.589 --> 39:54.502
I just woke up.
- So? This is not your bedroom!

39:55.693 --> 39:56.262
Look at Noorie. ..

40:01.132 --> 40:03.112
You want me to dress like Noorie?

40:05.236 --> 40:08.274
If you don't doll up, how
will you trap a nice boy'?

40:09.741 --> 40:13.279
That's what girls your age are meant to do.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.385
What did she say?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.196
Such a lovely colour you’re wearing...

40:32.130 --> 40:34.701
Listen, there’s an
authentic Turkish Hamam here.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.135
Do you want to come with us?

40:36.200 --> 40:36.678
No.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.203
I have asthma.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.339
The steam makes
me...

40:40.805 --> 40:42.113
I can't.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.820
She even has asthma...

40:52.717 --> 40:54.390
Now that college is over, Divya

40:54.452 --> 40:55.760
what is your career plan?

40:55.820 --> 40:57.197
I don't know...

40:57.255 --> 40:58.632
I like some things, but...

40:59.157 --> 41:00.067
Like what?

41:00.492 --> 41:01.664
You like to sleep.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.639
You could become a coma patient.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.207
Hello, girls!

41:08.099 --> 41:10.375
Sorry! I need to borrow
your sister for a minute...

41:13.671 --> 41:14.615
What happened?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.218
Saira Aunty just told me Amira is pregnant.

41:19.677 --> 41:20.621
That's great!

41:21.746 --> 41:22.486
Ifs IVF...

41:23.248 --> 41:24.192
We should also try it.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.328
<i>Speak to Sake aunty.</i>

41:27.085 --> 41:29.292
Let’s meet Amira’s doctor
as soon as we go back.

41:33.558 --> 41:34.730
Okay?
- Yes.

41:36.561 --> 41:37.539
We have to do this Aysh.

41:38.630 --> 41:39.734
Yes. ..Okay.

42:00.251 --> 42:00.991
Mama.

42:02.287 --> 42:02.765
Hmm...

42:06.291 --> 42:08.202
Why didn’t you divorce Papa?

42:11.162 --> 42:12.266
What kind of question is this?

42:18.303 --> 42:18.644
Look...

42:19.370 --> 42:21.213
I know what all he’s done.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.485
Every marriage has problems.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.048
If not an affair, then something else...

42:30.114 --> 42:32.094
Doesn’t mean you throw up your hands

42:32.550 --> 42:33.494
and leave.

42:35.053 --> 42:35.690
But why not?

42:38.156 --> 42:39.692
Because that is too easy.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.332
Staying together and solving
problems is difficult,

42:45.196 --> 42:45.765
But also the right thing to do.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.611
Marriage is not a race
you have to finish.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.815
If someone is not
happy then why can't -

42:54.038 --> 42:55.039
What is the matter with you?

42:57.075 --> 42:58.281
Did you have a fight with Ivlanav?

43:01.312 --> 43:03.292
Not a fight, but we aren’t-

43:03.348 --> 43:04.520
Ayesha, I don’t want to hear it!

43:06.384 --> 43:07.328
Ivlanav is a good man.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.693
He’s doing very well for himself.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.161
You'll always have
everything you want.

43:12.991 --> 43:15.403
Have everything I want?

43:18.029 --> 43:19.099
If thafs the case why didn’t you

43:19.130 --> 43:20.200
marry me off to a mall?

43:21.766 --> 43:22.676
Have you gone crazy?

43:26.304 --> 43:27.612
Just because your
company is doing well

43:28.473 --> 43:29.645
don't let it go to your head.

43:33.144 --> 43:34.145
Forget about your career,

43:35.046 --> 43:35.717
focus on your home.

43:46.357 --> 43:49.167
<i>We animals also train our young.</i>

43:49.494 --> 43:52.134
<i>A lioness teaches her cubs to hunt.</i>

43:52.363 --> 43:54.104
<i>A pigeon teaches her squabs to ﬂy.</i>

43:54.265 --> 43:56.142
<i>But once they’ve grown up,</i>

43:56.601 --> 43:59.207
<i>they are on their own.</i>

44:00.304 --> 44:03.251
<i>Indian parents somehow can? accept</i>

44:03.741 --> 44:05.516
<i>that their offspring
are capable enough</i>

44:05.576 --> 44:07.385
<i>to live life on their own terms.</i>

44:08.212 --> 44:08.622
Kabir.

44:09.013 --> 44:09.582
Yes.

44:10.214 --> 44:12.194
I've booked a table at the
night club for you kids.

44:12.283 --> 44:12.693
Sweet.

44:14.685 --> 44:15.720
Please invite Noorie also.

44:16.621 --> 44:17.463
Please.

44:20.124 --> 44:23.503
<i>They remain involved in
their children ’s lives</i>

44:23.561 --> 44:25.632
<i>way longer than required.</i>

44:27.165 --> 44:29.008
Are you going like this
or will you wear some clothes?

44:29.233 --> 44:30.211
Where is your jacket?

44:31.269 --> 44:35.240
<i>§f one thinks wearing a
jacket will solve the problem,</i>

44:35.606 --> 44:36.516
<i>they are sadly mistaken.</i>

44:37.175 --> 44:37.676
Take off your jacket.

44:40.478 --> 44:41.422
Mom, please!

44:41.579 --> 44:42.387
What please?

44:45.149 --> 44:46.150
Atleast wear some lipstick.

44:46.317 --> 44:48.092
<i>Wanted or not,</i>

44:49.120 --> 44:51.657
<i>the training never stops.</i>

44:52.724 --> 44:54.397
Stay away from Lalit Soocfs daughter.

44:54.759 --> 44:55.669
Understood?

44:56.227 --> 44:58.798
No need for hi, hellos.

44:59.464 --> 45:00.442
Dad...
- Cheers!

45:01.365 --> 45:03.572
<i>But can</i> a <i>leopard change his spots?</i>

45:04.702 --> 45:07.376
<i>Do what you want, the kids today</i>

45:08.039 --> 45:09.575

No offence ladies,

48:37.982 --> 48:38.585

48:40.051 --> 48:41.189
Would you like to go out

48:41.252 --> 48:42.287
for a drink or dinner

48:42.353 --> 48:43.161

49:39.510 --> 49:40.181
Kabir!

49:41.312 --> 49:42.052
Kabir, man...

49:42.146 --> 49:43.489
I was sleeping, these guys woke me up.

49:43.548 --> 49:44.583
You can sleep when you're dead.

49:44.715 --> 49:46.058
Hey! I thought the champagne

49:46.083 --> 49:47.084
was coming this way.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.528
Hold on! It's coming.

49:49.186 --> 49:51.723
Noorie, don't you
know sharing is caring.

49:52.389 --> 49:53.026
Here.

49:54.258 --> 49:55.464
<i>Oh no... That's</i> okay.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.197
What do you mean it's okay?
You'll fall sick.

49:57.294 --> 49:57.999
No really...

49:58.296 --> 49:59.001
that's okay...

49:59.630 --> 50:02.167
Anyway I wouldn't wear
this grandfather jacket.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.170
Did she just say 'grandfather jacket”?

50:05.503 --> 50:08.074
Noorie, you're a star!

50:08.706 --> 50:09.582
Speaking of stars...

50:10.641 --> 50:12.279
Does anyone know any Nakshatras?

50:13.544 --> 50:16.047
Dude, vvhafs a Nakshastra?

50:16.547 --> 50:17.525

Centaurus.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.123
It's half man, half horse.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.458
It has eleven stars...

50:22.686 --> 50:24.393
1, 2, s, 4...

50:25.156 --> 50:26.157
I can't see anything.

50:26.223 --> 50:27.725
And then you see the legs coming down...

50:28.425 --> 50:30.132
Can you see the shape?
- I can't see it...

50:30.194 --> 50:31.468
Ptolemy discovered it.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.198
It's from Greek mythology.

50:33.264 --> 50:33.765
I'm bored...

50:38.302 --> 50:40.145
<i>Yuck-mi puiao!</i>

50:41.505 --> 50:43.280
Some warning would have been nice...

50:44.508 --> 50:45.646
Come on, Divya!

50:45.710 --> 50:47.348
I'm so sorry...
- On my shoes!

50:48.145 --> 50:50.147
I'm feeling really sick...

50:52.049 --> 50:52.618
Not here.

50:53.050 --> 50:53.790
Over the railing.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.329
Over the railing.

50:55.419 --> 50:57.160
Shut up Ivlanav, you're so mean!

50:57.421 --> 50:58.525
Divya, that was epic!

50:59.323 --> 51:00.563
No!
It was epuke!

51:06.631 --> 51:07.473
Dude, I love your shoes!

51:07.765 --> 51:08.607
<i>Vomitino?</i>

51:14.739 --> 51:16.082
<i>Louis Voui-ton?</i>

51:16.340 --> 51:18.047
Come on, Kabir...
You really think this is funny!

51:20.678 --> 51:22.157
Divya what did you eat for breakfast?

51:22.213 --> 51:22.520
No!

51:22.713 --> 51:23.623
What did you eat for dessert?

51:23.647 --> 51:24.387
Barf-i?

51:43.734 --> 51:44.678
Istanbul!

51:46.203 --> 51:47.807
There is some magic in this name.

51:49.573 --> 51:51.314
Anything can happen here...

51:56.580 --> 51:59.254
Istanbul!

52:22.206 --> 52:23.549
It's really beautiful!

52:24.675 --> 52:25.210
Ready?

52:26.310 --> 52:27.084
Smile!

52:27.678 --> 52:28.622
Hello!

52:30.414 --> 52:31.688
Take one more.

52:47.064 --> 52:47.633
Namaste. ..

53:39.383 --> 53:40.361
Sir, you can't be here...

53:40.451 --> 53:41.486
I just want to meet.

53:41.552 --> 53:42.121
Hey!

53:44.688 --> 53:45.428
Hey!

53:51.028 --> 53:51.631
Hey!

53:53.397 --> 53:53.807
Hi!

53:57.067 --> 53:57.545
What do you want?

53:58.602 --> 53:59.342
Lunch.

54:00.371 --> 54:01.111
Yes or no?

54:03.474 --> 54:04.145

54:06.076 --> 54:06.554
Where?

54:08.412 --> 54:09.652
Taksim Square. 1.30.

54:21.024 --> 54:22.002
There are rules, you know?

54:23.294 --> 54:24.272
Who says I am going?

54:26.230 --> 54:26.731
Start again?

54:49.186 --> 54:51.564
The rule is we can't get
personally involved with guests.

54:51.622 --> 54:54.102
So if you can’t stay
away from my rehearsal...

54:54.692 --> 54:55.762
Keep your volume down.

54:58.595 --> 54:59.266

Ten days.

55:15.980 --> 55:16.583
Oops!

55:17.481 --> 55:18.687
We don’t have much time.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.588
So quickly tell me
everything about you.

55:22.553 --> 55:23.190

55:24.054 --> 55:24.657

55:36.767 --> 55:37.643
I want a dog.

55:38.702 --> 55:39.373
Grilled fish.

55:39.636 --> 55:40.307
Kebab platter.

55:40.671 --> 55:41.741
I can do a back flip.

55:42.139 --> 55:43.083
I can fly a plane.

55:48.245 --> 55:49.246
Can you ride a cycle?

55:50.381 --> 55:52.054
I have a birthmark on my right leg.

55:52.316 --> 55:53.624
I have a scar on the right leg.

55:53.717 --> 55:55.594
I fractured my hand when I was 8.

55:56.053 --> 55:57.225
Toe fracture when I was 16.

55:57.421 --> 55:58.229
No tattoos.

55:58.655 --> 55:59.326
One tattoo.

55:59.623 --> 56:00.192
Where?

56:01.292 --> 56:02.202
You’re in a hurry!

56:04.228 --> 56:05.070
Democracy!

56:05.162 --> 56:05.640
Dictatorship!

56:05.963 --> 56:06.566
What? Really?

56:06.630 --> 56:07.438
Don't judge!

56:07.598 --> 56:08.474
One serious girlfriend.

56:09.066 --> 56:10.044
One serious boyfriend.

56:10.167 --> 56:10.611
Cricket.

56:11.201 --> 56:11.702
Basketball.

56:12.002 --> 56:13.481
I love video games.
- I hate video games.

56:13.570 --> 56:15.572
What? Lame.
I can beat you in a cycle race.

56:15.973 --> 56:16.747
You can try.

56:53.143 --> 56:54.451
I bet my golf kit,

56:54.511 --> 56:57.424
Your dad wants Lalit
Sood to invest in Ayka.

57:01.085 --> 57:02.063
Why would you think that?

57:03.253 --> 57:05.199
Why else would he invite them?

57:08.058 --> 57:09.435
God I hope not...

57:11.095 --> 57:12.665
That Lalit Sood is a vulture.

57:14.298 --> 57:15.174
Your dad is a hawk.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.110
It's a perfect match.

57:21.372 --> 57:23.010
Why don’t we invest in Ayka?

57:23.573 --> 57:25.678
That way the company
will stay in the family.

57:27.378 --> 57:28.152
Are you crazy?

57:29.513 --> 57:31.186
I don’t want any new equation with

57:31.248 --> 57:32.989
your father or brother.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.092
But...

57:41.325 --> 57:42.599
when it comes to you...

57:44.561 --> 57:45.562
ifs a different matter.

57:52.269 --> 57:53.247
Please, lvlanav..

57:54.037 --> 57:54.640
Don't...

57:56.306 --> 57:58.183
It's been such a long
day, I'm so tired.

57:58.242 --> 57:59.016
Please...

57:59.410 --> 58:00.150
Please...

58:25.035 --> 58:25.740
Hey...

58:27.404 --> 58:28.405
Come here.

59:00.003 --> 59:00.572
Pluto...

59:02.205 --> 59:02.979
Hey!

59:04.274 --> 59:05.184
Pluto!

59:07.144 --> 59:07.986
Hi!

59:08.545 --> 59:09.421
Hi!

59:10.280 --> 59:11.190
Hi!

59:11.281 --> 59:13.124
Hi, Pluto! Hi, handsome!

59:19.589 --> 59:20.693
When I was one,

59:21.291 --> 59:22.429
whenever I heard music

59:23.460 --> 59:25.462
I would crawl to the speaker,

59:26.296 --> 59:27.331
hold n,

59:28.165 --> 59:29.735
prop myself up and jump...

59:30.000 --> 59:31.206
Up and down.

59:32.436 --> 59:33.471
What a memory!

59:35.072 --> 59:35.675
Shut up!

59:37.140 --> 59:38.118
My mom told me.

59:40.110 --> 59:40.986
Born to dance...

59:41.978 --> 59:42.649
Yes.

59:43.513 --> 59:44.583
I was born to dance.

59:46.450 --> 59:47.087
And you...

59:48.085 --> 59:48.756
Born for business?

59:53.023 --> 59:54.468
That's what my family says...

59:55.659 --> 59:56.535
Meaning?

59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.098
That is all I heard since I was a kid.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:02.707
So?

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.144
I was always told I have to

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.613
be a good housewife.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:08.646
Really?

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:12.278
My family is very conservative.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.112
So then?

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:16.556
L-low did you convince them'?

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:18.755
I cou|dn’t...

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:20.527
So I ran away.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:23.664
What do you mean ran away?

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.561
Like literally ran away?

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.294
Yes.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.366
My house was in Birmingham.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.707
One night I packed my bag,

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.671
put the 200 pounds I had saved

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.511
in my pocket...

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.071
and I took a train to London.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:41.645
What?

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:46.450
Where did you live?

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.178
I had some friends there.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.559
If I was lucky, their couch,

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.488
Otherwise a park bench.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:56.760
But mostly I was lucky.

01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:58.225
And money?

01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:59.329
I worked.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.232
Waitress.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.035
Bartender.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:06.701
That way I saved money

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.242
and paid for dance school.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.141
Fearless Farah...

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:19.144
If you were in my place
even you would be fearless.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.280
You vvoulcfve jumped from here...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.585
and then... sink or swim baby.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:37.462
<i>While some girls need to run,</i>

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.641
<i>others have to hide.</i>

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.779
<i>To live life on their own terms,</i>

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.409
<i>girls are often left with no choice.</i>

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:53.280
<i>Interestingly enough,
if</i> a <i>boy meets</i> a <i>girl,</i>

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:55.612
<i>the family has no prob/em at all.</i>

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:58.685
<i>In fact, they are happy</i>

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:00.653
<i>he’s all grown up.</i>

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.323
<i>But if a girl meets a boy,</i>

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:06.727
<i>the family is apparent/y dishonoured.</i>

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.129
<i>Whatever this logic</i> is...

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:12.104
<i>ifs beyond my understanding.</i>

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.034
God!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.403
Mom?

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:51.738
Where were you all night?

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.441
I was just hanging out.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:56.776
Hanging out what?

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:58.615
Clothes?

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.686
I was with a friend.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.019
We were talking.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.323
That's all.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:05.484
Who is this friend?

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.696
Who is this friend?

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:14.065
Kabir. ..

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.227
Last night...

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:44.424
Noorie was in Kabiﬁs room.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.491
L-low do you know'?

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:50.068
Naina told me.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.505
She is very upset.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:57.739
That's good news, Neelu!

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.545
What are you doing?

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.205
She is so upset!

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:03.984
I explained to her

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.247
if the kids want to
be together then...

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.181
We don't mind.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.120
Absolutely. We have no problem.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.663
Why would they have a problem?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.231
Noorie is Lalit Soocfs only daughter

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:25.130
and Kamal has zero credibility
in the market today.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.508
Being related to us will benefit him.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:28.338
Come on, Lalit!

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:29.341
Think of your own benefit.

01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:30.267
What?

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:31.671
Noorie should get married.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:33.078
Come on, Naina.
- iCome on.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.649
If we have to help them for that

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:36.649
what is the problem!

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.118
You are just...

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:39.313
Come on, trust me!

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.695
Where are you taking me?

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:52.131
Just come with me.

01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:53.734
You're making me nervous, Noorie.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.530
Sit.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:55.635
Why?

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.104
Sit!

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.067
If anyone asks, I was
with you last night...

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:02.666
Please!

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.443
Not bad, Noorieji!

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.084
That's one hell of
an emergency landing.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:13.553
Shut up!

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:15.649
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:17.691
Don't worry...

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.092
Your secret is safe with me.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.493
Thank you!
- Now listen.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.654
If anyone asks...

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.722
Tell them I was a
little unwell so I left.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.598
Where are you going?

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:53.526
Hey...

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.657
Whafre you doing?

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:26.416
<i>The ﬁrst time</i>

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:30.361
<i>when I laid eyes on you</i>

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.126
<i>Hear me girl,</i>

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:38.099
<i>this is what I made of you</i>

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:44.238
<i>I knew meeting you is the end of me</i>

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:48.381
<i>I spoke to my heart and said baby</i>

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:51.781
<i>Don? go down this road</i>

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:55.755
<i>This is not meant to be</i>

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.514
<i>But my heart...</i>

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.589
<i>said aloud</i>

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:03.430
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:07.298
<i>Have no fear, good or bad</i>

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.062
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.971
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:17.979
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:21.444
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:27.045
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.185
<i>The ﬁrst time</i>

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:39.131
<i>when I laid eyes on you</i>

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:42.596
<i>Hear me boy,</i>

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:46.664
<i>this is what I made of you</i>

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.678
<i>I knew you take advice from your heart</i>

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:56.743
<i>I knew you are siightiy crazy</i>

01:07:57.006 --> 01:08:00.510
<i>We’// speak of love when we meet</i>

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.457
<i>And the things you
say will be very sweet</i>

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:06.221
<i>But my heart...</i>

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.292
<i>said aloud</i>

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:12.192
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:16.067

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.638
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:22.540
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:26.546
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.212
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:35.586
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:17.221
<i>Like a Wave crashes into another,</i>

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:21.292
<i>Our heartbeats intertwine</i>

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:25.595
<i>We keep going, but lost in each other,</i>

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:29.200
<i>Are our hearts and minds.</i>

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.337
<i>How and why did we get so close</i>

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:36.515
<i>It may seem like</i> a <i>small thing</i>

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:40.210
<i>You’ve been thirsty for</i> a <i>while now</i>

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:43.553
<i>And I too have been longing</i>

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:47.354
<i>I knew meeting you is the end of me</i>

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:51.497
<i>I spoke to my heart and said baby</i>

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:55.101
<i>Don? go down this road</i>

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:59.066
<i>This is not meant to be</i>

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.630
<i>But my heart...</i>

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:02.701

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.613
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.515
<i>Have no fear, good or bad</i>

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.279
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:17.188
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.195
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:24.655
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:30.228
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:44.176
Our ship is not so far from Egypt
that you can’t come.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:48.318
Anyway I don’t keep well these days...

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.351
Who knows if I will be
able to travel again.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.184
Come, if you can...

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:55.662
It will make me happy.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:56.794
Okay, son.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:57.728
See you.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:05.505
Come on, Amrish uncle

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:07.770
VVasn’t that a little too melodramatic?

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:11.369
These days to meet your kids

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:14.010
you have to do a little drama.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.685
You haven’t seen Sunny
in a while, right?

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:22.352
Yes.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:29.018
So he is in Egypt these days?

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.362
Yes, EQYPt-

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.360
Look...

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:44.134
ls that his girlfriend?

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:46.809
Who knows?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.574
As if he will tell his father.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:04.623
Hey...

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.567
Thank you for inviting us.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.173
What are you saying, man...

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:28.213
Listen...

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:30.313
Can I speak to you honestly?

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:31.555
Of course, Lalit.

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:32.683
There are no secrets between us.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.791
What percentage of Ayka
are you planning to sell?

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.357
Prem told me.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:43.766
49%.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:45.595
I'm not happy

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.333
but it’s a way to expand the business.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.110
And what if I suggest...

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:59.185
that we take our friendship...

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.080
to the next level'?

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.529
The kids have grown quite close.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.622
Yes even I noticed.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:14.230
Good!

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:16.162
Noorie is a very sensible girl.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.533
So as I was saying...

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:27.170
Those shares...

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.674
Why don't I buy them?

01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:33.778
What?

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:40.127
If Kabir and Noorie
really want to be together

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.154
then the business will
stay in the family.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.562
Kabir and Noorie?

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:50.370
WOW !

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:54.741
The surprises life
throws at us, Lalit!

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.239
You tell me!

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:08.685
Cheers!

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:10.352
Cheers!

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:19.725
Good morning!

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.265
Good morning!

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:25.672
Breakfast?

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:27.765
No...

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:31.039
I have to host a dance
class for kids at 10.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:33.445
Come on, fearless Farah...

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.073
Call in sick.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.309
Don’t you get sick leave?

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.677
Of course!

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.019
Without pay.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.086
So, I'll pa)' You-

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:47.084
Money can't buy you everything, Ivlehra.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.562
It's just one day, Ali.

01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:52.691
Bunk it.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:55.701
You know...

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.700
Some people actually
enjoy what they do.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.997
Obviously you are not one of them.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.149
Lunch?

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:13.219
My treat.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:15.280
Lunch is not possible,

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.550
I have a family commitment.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.614
You want to come with me?

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.528
To your family lunch?

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:22.756
Yes.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:23.996
Why should I suffer alone?

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:28.297
Are you sure?

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:29.265
Yes.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.337
Please come...

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:32.702
You should also meet the loonies.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:36.609
Will you come?

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:40.004
<i>Okay . ....</i>

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:41.114
Yes!

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:42.745
You saved me!

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:58.390
If they've invited you, you must go.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:15:59.698
Great! Thank you.

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:01.966
We should make our guests
feel welcome.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.731
So attending a party is
well within the boundaries.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.529
Okay?

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:06.605
Thanks!

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.344
I told you it is not a theme party.

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:25.356
Sorry...
I have to do this.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.557
You knew it was a heart attack?

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:30.463
No.

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:34.360
It's goofs grace,
that Vandana isn't a widows today.

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.764
Widow.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.302
Drinking is allowed?

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.068
Yes...
I exercise a little

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.371
and I control my diets.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:45.706
Tell Neelu to control her diet too.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.509
Her food habits are very unhealthy.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.687
And wanting the body of
a 24 year old at his age

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.120
is very healthy.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.055
Hello, beautiful!

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.427
Kabir, where were you?

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:08.426
Farah, this is my crazy sister, Ayesha.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.966
Everyone says that dad
gave us all this money...

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.303
and you're crazy to
actually build the empire

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:14.306
that we've built.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:16.410
You need to look at the great leaders
and learn from them-

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:18.001
Who is that girl with Kabir?

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.680
Oh!

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:22.448
I know her.

01:17:22.572 --> 01:17:24.415
She is a dancer at Cha Cha Cha Club.

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:26.142
She was fantastic.

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:29.083
Oh! I think I've seen it
but from the outside.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.384
Hey Kabir, how's it going?

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:37.095
Good bro...

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.061
What happened?

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.258
Who is that girl?

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.737
Why is everyone asking about her?

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:48.434
Who all?

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:49.768
Naina Sood.

01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:57.084
She is a friend... Why?

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.548
Don’t you think it's inappropriate

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:01.714
to bring her to the party?

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.288
No, I don’t think so.

01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:07.019
Noorie could have a problem with it.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:08.560
Noorie?

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:12.562
Naina has told us everything.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.399
Told you what?

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.106
Noorie stayed in your room?

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:25.703
Now don’t pretend.

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:26.739
We know everything.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:33.743
Mom...Noorie is...

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.250
From a respectable family,
as are you.

01:18:38.514 --> 01:18:39.083
What?

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:40.523
What is so funny ya?

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.291
ls it a joke?

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:50.367
Kabir, ifs a serious matter!

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.065
The Soods are also worried.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.075
Papa, please ya!

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:58.006
Lalit spoke to me himself.

01:18:59.168 --> 01:19:00.943
I told him I'd speak
to you and let him know.

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:03.178
Okay, tell me...

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:06.349
What is your intention with Noorie?

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.247
My intention?!

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.478
Yes, your intention!

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:12.059
Has anyone spoken to Noorie?

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:14.522
I am sure her parents will talk to her.

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:15.287
Good.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:18.331
Because she has no interest
in a future with me.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.066
Then make her interested!

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.693
But even I am not interested.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:25.601
Are you interested in that plane?

01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:27.369
Tell me...

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.534
Do you want the plane or not?

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.977
Are you bribing me?

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.014
Kabir, don't be silly...

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.310
No, vvhafs going on?

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.677
ls Lalit Sood investing in Ayka?

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:42.147
Yes!

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:46.054
If this marriage happens.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.495
He will buy 49% stake in Ayka.

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:52.327
The company control stays with us...

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:54.126
Stays with you!

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.428
It will be perfect!

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:57.669
And...

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:00.098
We won’t have to sell the plane.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:02.500
You can have it,
all by yourself!

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:03.475
You can take your friends...

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.136
Fly Noorie around too!

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.217
Noorie is such a lovely girl.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.458
Papa, what are you guys doing here?

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.516
Everyone is asking...

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:27.424
What is going on?

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:31.697
You know what...

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:37.506
Let me speak to Noorie.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:41.474
Good.

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:44.448
About what?

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:46.085
Tell your sister...

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:47.485
Mom, please...

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.181
I told you

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.387
let me speak to Noorie first.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.316
Mom!

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:54.494
Kabir and Noorie. ..

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.397
What are you people doing?!

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.128
What are we doing?

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:03.596
Kabir, have you lost your mind?

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:04.537
Lost your mind?

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.672
They are made for each other!

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:08.640
You said the same thing about Ivlanav and me

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:09.767
and now I want a divorce-

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:22.087
What did she say?

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:53.111
Come here...

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:54.613
What are you doing?

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:01.323
Sunny is here.

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:02.586
Oh my god!

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:05.625
That's all I need...

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.996
What is going on, dude...
You are freaking me out.

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:08.726
I am freaking you out?
- Yes!

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:09.731
I am freaking you out!

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:10.697
And what are you doing?

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:14.002
Don’t listen to them.

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:15.406
You don't know them.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.308
Can you forget them for a moment?

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:18.538
L-low can I'?

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:22.205
They do everything
for their own benefit

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:22.749
Kabir!

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:25.413
Do you really want this marriage'?

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:28.678
Do you really want this divorce?

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.715
Has Ayesha mentioned this to you before?

01:23:03.846 --> 01:23:05.848
She said they are having problems.

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:07.590
What problems?

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:11.053
I don’t know...
I didn’t ask.

01:23:12.254 --> 01:23:13.164
You didn’t ask?

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:15.601
You didn’t even ask?

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:17.899
Are you deaf?

01:23:20.596 --> 01:23:21.768
I said what I had to.

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:23.299
Every marriage has problems.

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:25.272
No need to make it an issue, move on.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.839
What great advice, Neelam.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.642
She is moving on to a divorce.

01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:32.782
If you know better, speak to her.

01:23:32.975 --> 01:23:34.113
She is your daughter too.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.587
Why do you keep telling me?

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:44.696
Should I ask Prem to talk to her?

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:47.698
They are quite close.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.094
That's a brilliant idea!

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:55.372
Then he'll tell lndu and that radio
will broadcast it all over Delhi.

01:23:55.798 --> 01:23:57.800
She just needs an
excuse to talk about me.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.244
I think it's a fantastic idea!

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.548
Neelam ji will be really happy, Sunny.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:06.846
She’s asked about you twice.

01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:10.752
L-low long will you Keep working, Papa'?

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:12.786
What else will I do?

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:14.251
Retire...

01:24:15.017 --> 01:24:15.825
I am here.

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:17.990
L-low can I just quit'?

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.158
L-low would they feel.

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.159
They treat us like family.

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:26.000
Who takes their manager on a cruise?

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:30.208
Ayesha! Look...

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.103
The melodrama worked!

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:34.079
Yes...

01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:37.579
Don't be too long.

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:39.118
They are waiting.

01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:51.656

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:52.265

Sorry to disappoint you.

01:24:58.694 --> 01:24:59.798

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:23.319

I've been very lucky, touchvvood.

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:27.859
That's great.

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:29.597
Yes...

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:31.827
Oh my God!

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:34.170
It's Captain Sunny Gill!

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.070
It's Mr. Captain to you.

01:25:36.098 --> 01:25:38.135
Mr. Captain Sunny Gill!

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:43.349
<i>You never know who you'll run into</i>

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:46.347
<i>when you turn a corner.</i>

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:51.952
<i>Sunny Gill.</i>

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:56.994
<i>There was a time when Sunny
and Ayesha were very close.</i>

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.860
<i>The best of friends.</i>

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:03.667
<i>H1 fact, Sunny was the
one who gave me to Ayesha.</i>

01:26:04.927 --> 01:26:05.905
Those were the days.

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:08.005
<i>Sunny, Ayesha and Kabir.</i>

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.043
<i>That was my who/e world.</i>

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:12.807
<i>Then Sunny went far</i> away.

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:15.114
<i>Ayesha got married.</i>

Big journalist you have become.

01:26:44.099 --> 01:26:46.579
I try to read your articles,

01:26:46.635 --> 01:26:47.978
but they are very depressing.

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.844
All this bloodshed, war...

01:26:50.139 --> 01:26:51.846
Write some good news also!

01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:53.281
I write in the hope that one day

01:26:53.342 --> 01:26:55.015
the news will get better.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:56.189
Neelu!

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:58.353
Just look at this...

01:26:59.982 --> 01:27:01.222
That's beautiful!

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:02.784
It's from Egypt-

01:27:02.785 --> 01:27:03.923
Beautiful... Thank you.

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:04.657
You are most welcome.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:05.730
And also...

01:27:05.988 --> 01:27:06.898
Thank you for the cheque.

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.532
Who pays back money these days.

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:11.199
That too with interest, Amrish saab!

01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:14.764
I could never really repay you

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.106
for all you've done for me.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.239
Oh ho! Come here...

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.944
You’re like our son.

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:28.851
Now go get ready.

01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:32.023
Let's put our Punjabi livers to use!

01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:32.821
Okay!

01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:36.027
Bye, son!

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:47.200
Why did you take money from him?

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:50.208
He insisted, so I had to.

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.208
Why?

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:56.015
He is a good kid.

01:27:56.972 --> 01:27:58.952
I am glad he is doing so well.

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.817
I always knew he has it in him.

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:05.890
I'm glad I sent him
to study in America.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.285
You sent him to study?

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.625
As far as I can remember

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:14.166
you had another reason.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:53.935
Neelam.

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.235
Sorry we are late.

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.172
Actually, we were
waiting for our friends.

01:28:58.567 --> 01:28:59.944
They live here in Kusadasi.

01:29:00.869 --> 01:29:01.313
Sandhya

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:02.071
Naren

01:29:02.137 --> 01:29:02.808
Hi!

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:04.850
And this is Guler.

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:05.810
Oh yes.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:07.145
Guler.

01:29:07.242 --> 01:29:07.811
Hello...

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:08.888
Hi!

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:11.223
Guler.

01:29:11.547 --> 01:29:12.116
Gyuler.

01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:13.589
Gyuler. ..

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:14.524
That's better.

01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:16.826
Shall we?

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:18.860
Where is Noorie?

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:20.132
Don't ask!

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:21.133
You know how these Kids are.

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.567
She has left us

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:24.262
and gone outwith their son Kabir.

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:54.067
Mom!

01:29:58.961 --> 01:30:01.202
Don't worry about Ivlanav & me...

01:30:01.263 --> 01:30:02.139
We're fine.

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:04.541
I don't know why I said all that.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:05.841
Good.

01:30:07.269 --> 01:30:08.907
I think I was really upset and-

01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:09.915
Not now, Ayesha.

01:30:11.073 --> 01:30:11.949
We'll talk later.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:17.950
<i>Smka M. ....</i>

01:30:18.113 --> 01:30:18.682
Ivlanav...

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.190
Namaste.

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:20.959
He is a journalist.

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.959
He writes for The Geographic.

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:25.657
It's very big papeF---

01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:26.765
You must be reading it?

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:27.560
Papa...

01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:28.201
Please.

01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:29.533
That's okay...

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:31.065
Let him show off, it's only fair.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.230
Better if he did it behind my back.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:34.867
Hi.

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:37.173
Hi.

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:38.533
My wife, Ayesha.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.941
They used to be best friends.

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:43.544
Used to be meaning?

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:44.914
Nothing...

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.584
He went away to America.

01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:50.214
Where did you study, son?

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:52.181
Yale, aunty.

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:53.189
Oh!

01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:55.785
My uncle used to read law there...

01:30:56.218 --> 01:30:58.220
'68...maybe '69...

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:00.293
Will she hang it on the walls?

01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:02.158
You can hang carpets
on the wall right?

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.866
I guess if you don't understand art

01:31:04.893 --> 01:31:06.099
then you should hang carpets!

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:09.635
Excuse me.

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:12.238
That's an amazing story.

01:31:12.768 --> 01:31:13.644
Thank you.

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:15.780
Thank you for listening.

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:16.844
Neelam...

01:31:17.005 --> 01:31:18.211
Come sit with us.

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:19.913
I am sure they'll
give us another chair.

01:31:20.075 --> 01:31:21.782
No, lam good...
I am really good.

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.117
I just wanted to borrow
my husband for a minute...

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:24.986
Of course.

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:25.851
Darling

01:31:35.724 --> 01:31:38.068
Do you have to do this
on our anniversary?

01:31:38.894 --> 01:31:40.202
Why, what did I do?

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:43.573
Please don’t embarrass me, Kamal.

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.769
You've been stuck to
that Guler like a leech.

01:31:47.736 --> 01:31:48.680
Have you gone mad?

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:51.006
They are our guests.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.083
I am just looking after them
and so should you.

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:58.140
You know Noorie and me are together?

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:00.712
So why did you propose to her?

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:01.747
Me?

01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:04.120
Kamal uncle spoke to my parents.

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:05.124
Excuse me?

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.184
Your parents spoke to my dad-

01:33:07.215 --> 01:33:08.125
Whatever, Kabir.

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.226
You could have said no.

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:09.887
No.

01:33:10.886 --> 01:33:12.263
Because thanks to
Noorie, everyone thinks

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.765
she is in my room every night.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:15.961
Thank you...

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:17.293
For keeping quiet.

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:18.603
But enough now.

01:33:18.994 --> 01:33:20.940
We are not in school.

01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:23.709
I don't care what our families think.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:26.210
I care, baby.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.216
Babies!

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.315
You guys really like each other.

01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:37.716
WOW !

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.617
Your story is just
like Romeo and Juliet...

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.290
Warring families, tragic ending...

01:33:45.654 --> 01:33:47.133
That was a bad space, man!

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.098
But what if I say...

01:33:56.131 --> 01:33:58.873
That your story can
have a happy twist...

01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:00.641
How?

01:34:03.205 --> 01:34:04.149
By getting engaged to me.

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:05.150
Excuse me?

01:34:05.207 --> 01:34:06.550
No, no... Wait. Hear me out...

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:08.650
Just for now.

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:12.216
Mom, Dad, Uncle,
Aunty, everyone happy!

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.055
Then...

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:16.854
A few months later...

01:34:18.053 --> 01:34:19.031
I will dump you.

01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:20.731
Great!
- Wait, wait...

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.764
Then...

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.272
You cry, shout, scream, pass out...

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:27.898
Try to kill yourself...

01:34:27.963 --> 01:34:28.600
Sure!

01:34:28.697 --> 01:34:30.973
Your parents will do
anything to save you.

01:34:32.067 --> 01:34:32.670
Right?

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:34.772
Then...

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.975
You say...

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:38.877
"I want to be with Noorie."

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:41.950
That's it...

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:44.589
For your parents he will be like

01:34:44.646 --> 01:34:45.716
a knight in shining armour!

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:50.262
It's genius!

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:53.222
And what about your parents?

01:34:55.757 --> 01:34:56.963
What do you mean cancel the wedding?

01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.334
The cards have been printed.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:01.806
What do I do?

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:06.043
Noorie loves someone else.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:07.945
Who?

01:35:09.838 --> 01:35:10.748
She loves Rana.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.716
Rana Khanna?

01:35:13.742 --> 01:35:15.813
Because of their family
problems, she agreed-

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:16.878
This is ridiculous!

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:18.680
I'm going to call Naina right now.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.790
It isn't Noorie's fault, Mom!

01:35:21.683 --> 01:35:22.753
It's mine.

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.121
So stupid...

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:30.736
I did all this for the company.

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.337
But I really fell in love with her.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.146
I just want her to be happy.

01:35:41.803 --> 01:35:42.873
That's all I want.

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.582
Oh my baby...

01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:47.746
Oh my child...

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.649
I made a big mistake.

01:35:53.048 --> 01:35:54.755
What are we going to do, Papa?

01:35:56.885 --> 01:35:57.829
You should sell the plane.

01:35:58.119 --> 01:35:58.961
No...

01:35:59.187 --> 01:35:59.961
No!

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:01.199
Absolutely not!

01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:03.160
That's the least we can do for him.

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:23.214
You look very happy...

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.981
I am thinking about our bright future.

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.694
I've seen many make
promises on this ship.

01:36:32.654 --> 01:36:33.997
But as soon as the journey ends...

01:36:34.022 --> 01:36:35.194
Poof!

01:36:36.191 --> 01:36:36.965
Gone!

01:36:39.995 --> 01:36:41.269
Are you allergic to romance?

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:43.575
I am being practical.

01:36:43.932 --> 01:36:45.843
Being practical!!!

01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:48.213
ls that what they teach you in London

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.646
is to be practical?

01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:52.908
You see it's very important
for every individual to be practical!

01:36:53.942 --> 01:36:55.046
If Shah Jehan was practical,

01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:56.783
who would've built the Taj Mahal'?

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:01.225
What are you doing?

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:02.884
Say you love me...

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:04.521
What?

01:37:04.786 --> 01:37:05.526
Say you love me.

01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:06.298
No...

01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:07.562
Say it.

01:37:07.756 --> 01:37:08.200
No!

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:08.927
Say it!

01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:10.763
Kabir stop it, I am really ticklish.

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:12.101
No!

01:37:12.961 --> 01:37:13.701
Say it!

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:21.145
I love you!

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.244
You could be on any ship...

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:30.255
It won't sail without me.

01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:53.866
Awesome!

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:55.206
Thank you!

01:38:56.331 --> 01:38:56.968
Who's next?

01:38:57.732 --> 01:38:58.176
Me!

01:39:06.074 --> 01:39:07.052
Kiss me!

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:12.223
Any requests?

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:22.964
Who did this?

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:24.797
What nonsense is this?

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:26.937
Who did it?

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:28.038
Don't laugh, Jamaal.

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:29.039
This is rubbish!

01:39:30.098 --> 01:39:30.838
I am waiting.

01:39:31.566 --> 01:39:31.941
<i>Bhabhi J5!</i>

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.035
Vinod, don't get involved.

01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:34.307
It was a jokes.

01:39:35.237 --> 01:39:36.545
Bhabhi ji, it was a jokes.

01:39:36.604 --> 01:39:37.981
Kids joke.

01:39:38.173 --> 01:39:40.653
This is very wrong, whoever did this.

01:39:40.775 --> 01:39:41.719
Don't do it again.

01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:43.216
Okay? Sorted?

01:39:43.712 --> 01:39:44.747
Now have a drinks!

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:49.554
OK now, a song for the host couples!

01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:02.767
<i>PH break into a bhangra</i>

01:40:02.797 --> 01:40:04.208
<i>You also put on your dancing shoes</i>

01:40:04.566 --> 01:40:06.568
<i>Come on, Iefs paint this town red</i>

01:40:06.634 --> 01:40:08.739
<i>And get everyone to
show us their</i> moves

01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:14.780
<i>I feel like fetching</i>

01:40:14.843 --> 01:40:16.584
For you the stars <i>&</i> the moon

01:40:16.645 --> 01:40:18.556
<i>The moon, PH place in my hand</i>

01:40:18.613 --> 01:40:20.786
<i>In my hair, will be the stars strewn.</i>

01:40:24.652 --> 01:40:26.097
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:28.589
<i>Since you’ve hit the floor</i>

01:40:28.656 --> 01:40:30.067
<i>YeHo YeHo...</i>

01:40:30.658 --> 01:40:32.569
<i>A magic night is in store</i>

01:40:32.627 --> 01:40:34.265
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:36.609
You seem to have consumed a lot

01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:38.109
<i>YeHo YeHo...</i>

01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:40.873
<i>Brother, you got no control at all!</i>

01:40:40.902 --> 01:40:42.813
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:40:42.837 --> 01:40:45.784
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.945
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:50.649
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:40:58.887 --> 01:41:00.867
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:41:00.922 --> 01:41:03.801
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:41:03.825 --> 01:41:06.032
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

01:41:06.094 --> 01:41:08.734
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:41:16.671 --> 01:41:18.844
<i>That ﬂutter in your eyes</i>

01:41:18.907 --> 01:41:20.545
<i>Tortures me</i> a <i>lot</i>

01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:22.849
<i>Till date you just have to look at me</i>

01:41:22.877 --> 01:41:24.982
<i>And an arrow hits the spot</i>

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:30.856
<i>Without a drink I get high</i>

01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:32.296
<i>Your beauty is all I need</i>

01:41:32.687 --> 01:41:34.667
<i>How can anyone stay sane</i>

01:41:34.722 --> 01:41:37.066
<i>With</i> the restlessness
you make them feel

01:41:40.662 --> 01:41:42.107
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

01:41:42.697 --> 01:41:44.677
<i>These hearts must connect</i>

01:41:44.699 --> 01:41:46.610
Ye/lo Ye/lo. . .

01:41:46.634 --> 01:41:48.910
<i>The line should be direct</i>

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:50.710
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:41:50.738 --> 01:41:53.685
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:41:53.942 --> 01:41:55.683
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

01:41:55.744 --> 01:41:58.748
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:42:06.855 --> 01:42:08.596
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:42:08.656 --> 01:42:11.660
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:42:11.893 --> 01:42:13.668
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

01:42:13.695 --> 01:42:16.676
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:18.668
<i>I don? know why</i>

01:43:18.826 --> 01:43:20.305
<i>This crazy girPs so happy</i>

01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:22.603
<i>Can this story please be</i>

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:24.571
<i>Explained to me</i>

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.335
<i>The thing that everyone wants</i>

01:43:26.801 --> 01:43:28.747
<i>is to ﬁnd their dream woman or man</i>

01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:30.646
<i>That is what has happened here</i>

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.978
<i>Now do you understand</i>

01:43:33.107 --> 01:43:34.017
<i>Now l know,</i>

01:43:34.175 --> 01:43:36.951
<i>The song you are sing</i>

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:38.986
<i>Tougher than ﬁnding the love</i>

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.750
<i>is honoring the thing</i>

01:43:40.815 --> 01:43:42.294
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:44.661
<i>don? mind if I say this much</i>

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:46.254
<i>YeHo YeHo...</i>

01:43:46.754 --> 01:43:49.064
<i>Could you please keep in touch</i>

01:43:49.123 --> 01:43:50.864
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:53.839
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:43:54.094 --> 01:43:55.835
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:58.900
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.849
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

01:44:08.876 --> 01:44:11.823
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.820

01:44:13.881 --> 01:44:16.919
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:32.269
Here you all are!

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.143
Delhi's Beyonce!!!

01:44:34.202 --> 01:44:35.840
lndu Aunty!!!

01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:41.818
You are the one!

01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:43.347
She is a star!

01:44:44.779 --> 01:44:46.053
Why are you in the bar, Putlu?

01:44:46.114 --> 01:44:48.355
Where else would I
be after your dance?

01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:49.623
Shut up!

01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:51.626
lndu Aunty you were amazing!

01:44:51.886 --> 01:44:52.990
Thanks!
- So good!

01:44:53.354 --> 01:44:54.594
I got carried away.

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.860
I would never do this in Delhi.

01:44:57.592 --> 01:44:58.696
What would people think?

01:44:58.926 --> 01:45:00.599
They won’t think anything.

01:45:00.662 --> 01:45:02.107
We are ready for your talent.

01:45:03.064 --> 01:45:04.566
Maybe you are ready

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:06.737
but what will the public say?

01:45:07.168 --> 01:45:08.272
You will have to migrate now,

01:45:08.536 --> 01:45:09.742
it's about your image!

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:14.983
You journalists make such
a big deal about everything.

01:45:15.009 --> 01:45:16.147
Big deal?

01:45:17.178 --> 01:45:17.781
Really?

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:19.951
Yes... Seriously.

01:45:20.615 --> 01:45:23.061
Look what you're writing
on women's issues...

01:45:23.851 --> 01:45:25.831
You people make it seem like

01:45:26.287 --> 01:45:29.200
women here are unsafe all the time.

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:31.864
Every survey seems to say that.

01:45:32.627 --> 01:45:33.867
And it’s not just about safety,

01:45:33.995 --> 01:45:36.168
it's also about equal rights-

01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:37.607
Precisely, things are changing.

01:45:37.799 --> 01:45:39.107
Slowly but surely,
things are changing.

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:40.601
Take my own family...

01:45:41.302 --> 01:45:44.283
Till my dads generation,
no woman had worked.

01:45:44.305 --> 01:45:44.874
Never!

01:45:46.274 --> 01:45:48.652
But I allowed Ayesha
to run her business.

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:53.291
You allowed Ayesha?

01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:54.092
Yes!

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:58.694
And why does she need your permission?

01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:01.129
You know what I mean.

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.591
No, I don't know what you mean.

01:46:04.158 --> 01:46:06.069
Allowing someone means you are

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:08.265
in a position of
authority, of control...

01:46:09.297 --> 01:46:10.833
And that is not equality.

01:46:13.668 --> 01:46:14.237
But thank you.

01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:17.672
You just proved my point.

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:20.882
Cheers!

01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:23.720
I love you...

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:30.256
<i>Indu year!</i>

01:46:36.758 --> 01:46:37.099
Sunny!

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.961
What was that?

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:42.172
What?

01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:45.171
What was the need to be rude to Ivlanav?

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.208
Why put him down?

01:46:47.268 --> 01:46:48.212
What was the point...

01:46:48.269 --> 01:46:49.646
And he can put you down?

01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:52.914
Q Kay-

01:46:56.177 --> 01:46:57.315
I am still talking to you.

01:46:57.578 --> 01:46:58.318
What do you want to say?

01:47:00.648 --> 01:47:01.285
What do you want to say?

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.556
I know you sold yourjewellery

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:08.827
to start your business.

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:10.834
Without anybody's help

01:47:10.892 --> 01:47:12.565
look at where you've reached.

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.065
And I am really proud of you!

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:17.265
That's it.

01:48:07.014 --> 01:48:08.049
Who the hell does he think he is?

01:48:10.117 --> 01:48:11.892
L-low can he lecture me about you'?

01:48:13.754 --> 01:48:16.098
He must think I ill-treat you.

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:18.227
Ridiculous!

01:48:19.527 --> 01:48:20.938
Bloody journalist-activist types.

01:48:21.696 --> 01:48:22.902
They have no balance.

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:24.733
Everything is black or white for them.

01:48:26.567 --> 01:48:29.309
Don't I have a say
in what my wife does?

01:48:30.271 --> 01:48:32.046
Don't I have the right to an opinion?

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:34.885
We are a married couple, dammit.

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:36.880
I have the right.

01:48:36.944 --> 01:48:37.752
I want a divorce...

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:40.714
And when I said that I allow you,

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:41.985
it doesn't mean that-

01:48:42.049 --> 01:48:43.119
I want a divorce.

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:45.128
What?

01:48:49.056 --> 01:48:50.330
You want a divorce...

01:48:51.659 --> 01:48:53.798
Because of that stupid argument?

01:48:58.065 --> 01:48:59.874
Because I don't love you.

01:49:07.775 --> 01:49:09.516
I really tried, Ivlanav...

01:49:16.717 --> 01:49:18.560
But I can't pretend anymore.

01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:21.192
I can't...

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:25.530
I really tried.

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.105
I am sorry...

01:49:35.169 --> 01:49:37.775
I'm sorry I couldn't love you.

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.243
I am sorry...

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.764
You should have spoken to me...

01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:04.707
I am also like your mother.

01:50:11.772 --> 01:50:12.750
Never mind...

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:14.918
What is the problem?

01:50:22.283 --> 01:50:26.754
I don't feel for Ivlanav

01:50:29.256 --> 01:50:31.133
the way I am supposed to.

01:50:31.926 --> 01:50:32.666
But...

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:34.102
What is the problem?

01:50:45.873 --> 01:50:48.012
We are not right for each other...

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.314
We are not compatible-

01:50:51.545 --> 01:50:52.319
Not compatible? How?

01:50:55.716 --> 01:50:56.694
You are both young,

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:57.826
successful,

01:50:58.586 --> 01:50:58.996
Punjabi...

01:50:59.052 --> 01:50:59.996
You both play squash.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:00.896
Tennis.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.866
Yes Papa, but...

01:51:05.559 --> 01:51:07.129
We are still very different.

01:51:08.763 --> 01:51:09.867
Ivlanav is your husband

01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:10.874
not your twin brother.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:14.873
Has he ever hit you?

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:16.203
God!

01:51:16.737 --> 01:51:17.647
No, Mom!

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:20.609
ls he stingy?

01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:24.885
You don't let her shop?

01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:32.092
ls he having an affair?

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:33.958
No!

01:51:37.558 --> 01:51:39.663
Even Ivlanav won't be happy with me.

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:40.999
That is my decision, Aysh.

01:51:45.833 --> 01:51:47.710
Every marriage has problems.

01:51:48.602 --> 01:51:52.106
Just have a baby,
everything will be fine.

01:51:53.941 --> 01:51:55.011
You are right.

01:51:56.544 --> 01:51:57.648
When you become a mother,

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:01.316
all these problems will go away.

01:52:04.718 --> 01:52:06.664
If I'm not happy in this relationship,

01:52:06.987 --> 01:52:09.627
then having a baby...

01:52:14.128 --> 01:52:15.664
It didn't feel right.

01:52:19.133 --> 01:52:20.806
I've been on the pill.

01:52:23.737 --> 01:52:24.545
What?

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:30.150
This is not the place
for this conversation.

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:32.953
Sorry...

01:52:33.547 --> 01:52:34.287
You are right,

01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:36.785
this is between Ivlanav and me.

01:52:36.917 --> 01:52:37.861
We are family!

01:52:39.553 --> 01:52:41.897
We are here to celebrate
our anniversary.

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:45.561
What will our guests
think if they hear this?

01:52:46.026 --> 01:52:47.061
Have you thought about that!

01:52:49.163 --> 01:52:51.040
There has been no
divorce in this family

01:52:51.832 --> 01:52:52.867
and there never will be.

01:52:54.301 --> 01:52:55.905
You get that straight!

01:53:05.179 --> 01:53:07.284
Now tell me this won't
ever come up again.

01:53:10.117 --> 01:53:11.562
I am talking to you, Ayesha.

01:53:14.054 --> 01:53:14.828
Answer me!

01:53:25.833 --> 01:53:26.903
I am sorry, Papa.

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.842
I can’t do that.

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:34.044
So you're just going to leave?

01:53:36.043 --> 01:53:37.886
Why are you doing this to us?

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:42.590
Don’t think you can come back to us.

01:53:45.619 --> 01:53:47.030
That is not your home anymore.

01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:52.161
We are not going to
support this nonsense.

01:54:02.970 --> 01:54:03.812
Q Kay-

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:07.550
Q Kay-

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:13.620
Q Kay-

01:54:16.817 --> 01:54:17.727
Where are you going?

01:54:18.018 --> 01:54:18.996
Ayeshal!

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:21.723
Kabir.

01:54:21.889 --> 01:54:22.663
Just go and get her.

01:54:32.066 --> 01:54:32.840
Ya, Papa...

01:54:34.268 --> 01:54:36.578
I am looking...
I can't seem to find her.

01:54:38.572 --> 01:54:38.913
Q Kay-

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:48.156
Yes, I am still looking.

01:55:25.986 --> 01:55:26.930
Where is Ayesha?

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.663
She is very upset.

01:55:29.957 --> 01:55:30.833
She is upset?

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:31.595
Why?

01:55:32.993 --> 01:55:36.770
Papa, how could you tell
her she can't come home'?

01:55:40.634 --> 01:55:42.307
I'm doing this for her benefit.

01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:44.342
It is for her own good.

01:55:45.839 --> 01:55:47.113
If Ayesha is not welcome at home,

01:55:47.141 --> 01:55:48.677
then I can't live there either.

01:55:52.813 --> 01:55:53.757
What is this drama?

01:55:53.814 --> 01:55:54.690
It's not drama.

01:55:54.748 --> 01:55:55.988
Then what? Emotional blackmail?

01:55:56.617 --> 01:55:57.721
Are you emotionally blackmailing me?

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:59.058
Think what you want...

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.061
Then go...

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:02.729
Get out.

01:56:03.156 --> 01:56:04.863
Let's see how far you reach.

01:56:06.126 --> 01:56:08.197
You can’t even get a day’s work done.

01:56:12.766 --> 01:56:13.972
What have you done in life?

01:56:14.301 --> 01:56:15.075
Tell me?

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:17.047
What do you have?

01:56:17.605 --> 01:56:18.276
Nothing!

01:56:19.606 --> 01:56:22.212
You are lucky, I am your father.

01:56:23.577 --> 01:56:24.112
Go...

01:56:24.678 --> 01:56:25.884
Try working outside.

01:56:26.914 --> 01:56:29.053
You'll come to your
senses in two days.

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.061
Bloody idiot.

01:56:46.033 --> 01:56:48.240
People say things they
don't mean in anger.

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.241
He was right...

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:56.654
What have I done?

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.647
What do I have?

01:57:08.088 --> 01:57:09.567
You have this...

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.168
And this.

01:57:14.795 --> 01:57:17.036
Take a decision from the heart.

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:20.008
Your mind will figure a way out.

01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:24.142
ls it that simple?

01:57:25.305 --> 01:57:25.908
No.

01:57:27.107 --> 01:57:28.916
Some hard work is also required.

01:57:31.879 --> 01:57:33.552
Will the soles of my shoes wear out?

01:57:33.847 --> 01:57:34.552
What?

01:57:41.088 --> 01:57:42.567
You're in love, baby!

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:43.096
Shut up...

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.896
You're in a bad space, man!

01:57:50.697 --> 01:57:51.937
I won't ditch you.

01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:54.135
As soon as the
engagement is announced,

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.611
I'll dump you.

01:57:55.803 --> 01:57:56.941
Until then just...

01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:15.824
Careful, please!

01:58:19.526 --> 01:58:21.597
Sorry, didn’t mean to ruin your plan.

01:58:22.296 --> 01:58:23.274
What plan?

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:26.007
You were about to jump right?

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:37.282
Listen you were right...

01:58:38.812 --> 01:58:40.723
I shouldn’t have spoken
to Ivlanav like that.

01:58:42.616 --> 01:58:43.822
It was rude.

01:58:44.885 --> 01:58:46.330
It's your marriage...

01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:49.066
What is right or wrong

01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:50.891
is none of my business.

01:58:52.292 --> 01:58:53.293
Just wanted to say

01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:55.101
I won't cross the line again.

01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:57.665
I'm really sorry.

01:59:07.941 --> 01:59:08.919
Friends?

01:59:12.078 --> 01:59:12.920
|’d rather jump.

01:59:18.785 --> 01:59:19.195
Come on, Pluto.

01:59:20.153 --> 01:59:20.961
Come on, baby.

01:59:23.857 --> 01:59:24.232
Come on!

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:32.872
I guess he wants to stay.

01:59:49.082 --> 01:59:49.822
Pluto...

01:59:52.786 --> 01:59:54.993
You were supposed to
remind her of me...

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:58.761
What happened buddy?

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:08.668
<i>Human beings are so strange...</i>

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:11.604
<i>The things they say to someone</i>

02:00:11.672 --> 02:00:13.709
are often meant for someone else.

02:00:14.641 --> 02:00:17.952
<i>And the conversation they
shy away from the most</i>

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:22.891
<i>is of the heart, of love.</i>

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:25.788
<i>But ifs the only thing that matters.</i>

02:00:27.788 --> 02:00:29.893
<i>Now how to explain to them</i>

02:00:29.957 --> 02:00:32.665
<i>that if you love someone,</i>

02:00:33.093 --> 02:00:34.902
<i>just show it.</i>

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:03.267
<i>There’re no roads, near or far</i>

02:01:03.557 --> 02:01:06.094
<i>Where a twist or a turn, is ever afar</i>

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.266
<i>This heart wants to let it go</i>

02:01:09.663 --> 02:01:12.576
<i>These rafters, don? you try to sew</i>

02:01:12.733 --> 02:01:15.213
<i>The road We Walk,</i>

02:01:15.902 --> 02:01:17.939
<i>Many a times, forks into two</i>

02:01:18.905 --> 02:01:21.215
<i>At every step, we find the love,</i>

02:01:21.975 --> 02:01:25.184
At every other, <i>it</i> leaves us <i>blue.</i>

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:26.783
<i>But still this life</i>

02:01:26.847 --> 02:01:28.190
For even a second

02:01:28.248 --> 02:01:30.819
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:32.824
These waves of time

02:01:32.886 --> 02:01:34.763
For even a second

02:01:34.788 --> 02:01:36.927
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

02:01:36.957 --> 02:01:39.164
<i>This loneliness. . .</i>

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:48.045
becomes the air <i>I</i> breathe. <i>. .</i>

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:55.676
<i>l know not, What to do...</i>

02:02:08.255 --> 02:02:13.568
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

02:02:14.594 --> 02:02:19.043
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

02:02:19.499 --> 02:02:22.742
<i>Straighten them out . ..</i>

02:02:23.637 --> 02:02:27.813
<i>FoHow the heart, you dreamer</i>

02:02:28.141 --> 02:02:33.614
<i>It tells the truth, have no doubt</i>

02:02:38.585 --> 02:02:44.536
<i>There</i> is a restlessness <i>in my</i> hopes;

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:49.002
<i>A dream rests on shut eyes</i>

02:02:50.764 --> 02:02:56.146
<i>This longing I had put to sleep,</i>

02:02:56.803 --> 02:03:01.843
<i>Once again, is aching to rise</i>

02:03:02.909 --> 02:03:05.913
<i>Which road you want to take...</i>

02:03:05.979 --> 02:03:14.865
<i>why don? you know my crazy head.</i> ..

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.192
<i>But still this life</i>

02:03:16.256 --> 02:03:17.792
For even a second

02:03:17.858 --> 02:03:20.236
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

02:03:20.994 --> 02:03:22.234
These waves of time

02:03:22.295 --> 02:03:24.172
For even a second

02:03:24.231 --> 02:03:26.336
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

02:03:26.599 --> 02:03:28.738
<i>This loneliness. . .</i>

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:37.621

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:45.086
<i>l know not, What to do...</i>

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:53.997
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

02:03:54.995 --> 02:03:59.671
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:03.073
<i>Straighten them out . ..</i>

02:04:03.937 --> 02:04:08.147
<i>FoHow the heart, you dreamer</i>

02:04:08.642 --> 02:04:13.955
<i>It tells the truth, have no doubt</i>

02:04:20.053 --> 02:04:22.055
This cruise is really costing a lot...

02:04:22.656 --> 02:04:23.726
That Anju is an alcoholic!

02:04:24.157 --> 02:04:26.728
She cans a crate of
champagne every evening.

02:04:32.732 --> 02:04:33.642
What are you taking?

02:04:36.036 --> 02:04:38.209
Something to help digest this bill.

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.717
Why don’t you announce
Kabiﬁs engagement?

02:04:49.883 --> 02:04:52.329
Waiting on Soocfs astrologer.

02:04:52.986 --> 02:04:54.124
Can you believe it?

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:57.964
No one is ready to believe

02:04:58.024 --> 02:05:00.231
that Lalit Sood is
investing in our company.

02:05:01.061 --> 02:05:03.166
This news will shut them up.

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.252
Did you tell lndu
about the engagement?

02:05:17.644 --> 02:05:18.281
No!

02:05:19.779 --> 02:05:21.690
She can't keep
anything in her stomach.

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:26.824
Then it is time to
give her the good news...

02:05:29.723 --> 02:05:30.701
This Noorie...

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:32.635
is very smart.

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:34.133
Why?

02:05:34.794 --> 02:05:35.704
Just tell us now.

02:05:37.630 --> 02:05:39.200
She has gone and conquered Kabir.

02:05:41.301 --> 02:05:42.803
Kabir and Noorie?

02:05:43.837 --> 02:05:45.009
I didn't say anything.

02:05:46.873 --> 02:05:48.318
I'm just worried about Divya.

02:05:48.575 --> 02:05:50.577
That girl needs to up her game.

02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:52.747
L-low to dress, how to behave...

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:56.019
I was so impressed with your Rana...

02:05:56.616 --> 02:05:59.062
But she went and vomited on him.

02:05:59.986 --> 02:06:00.726
What?!

02:06:01.788 --> 02:06:02.266
Yes...

02:06:03.590 --> 02:06:05.228
That chapter is closed for me.

02:06:05.792 --> 02:06:06.770
lam moving on.

02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:08.766
What do you think about Sunny?

02:06:09.129 --> 02:06:10.267
Very handsome

02:06:11.231 --> 02:06:12.073
and different.

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:13.542
What is different?

02:06:13.633 --> 02:06:15.635
All men want the same kind of wife.

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:17.804
I'll talk to Neelu Bhabhi.

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:18.848
About what?

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:23.710
About Divya & Sunny's match...

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:31.286
isn't Divya a bit young'?

02:06:31.651 --> 02:06:32.755
What is young?

02:06:33.053 --> 02:06:35.260
At her age, your mother had two kids.

02:06:36.256 --> 02:06:36.996
Talk to Neelu na.

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:38.797
Tell Prem to talk to Amrish.

02:06:38.825 --> 02:06:40.964
Sunny is quite a famous
journalist, I hear.

02:06:41.728 --> 02:06:42.263
I know.

02:06:42.328 --> 02:06:44.103
Divya will get a chance to travel-

02:06:44.164 --> 02:06:46.735
Don't you all have
anything better to do?

02:06:47.133 --> 02:06:47.838
Please!

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:51.975
Leave your kids alone
and get a life.

02:06:53.106 --> 02:06:54.107
Get a job!

02:07:01.648 --> 02:07:02.752
Has she gone mad?

02:07:03.849 --> 02:07:05.123
Who will give us a job?

02:07:10.624 --> 02:07:11.227
Yes...

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:15.836
Yes yes, coming.

02:07:18.064 --> 02:07:18.565
Hey!

02:07:18.898 --> 02:07:22.004
Those hags are plotting
your marriage to Divya.

02:07:23.303 --> 02:07:23.906
What?

02:07:24.304 --> 02:07:24.941
Yup...

02:07:25.105 --> 02:07:25.879
You heard me.

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:28.179
I like what you are wearing, by the way.

02:07:31.144 --> 02:07:32.122
So... With Divya?

02:07:33.079 --> 02:07:34.023
Please, Sunny.

02:07:35.081 --> 02:07:36.185
What is their plan?

02:07:36.583 --> 02:07:37.687
It's not a joke.

02:07:38.718 --> 02:07:41.665
Don’t encourage them.
If they ask, just say no.

02:07:41.721 --> 02:07:42.995
Just... No!

02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:44.600
Why?

02:07:44.758 --> 02:07:46.328
I don’t even know Divya...

02:07:46.693 --> 02:07:48.673
She could be a very nice girl.

02:07:49.195 --> 02:07:50.572
She is my cousin!

02:07:50.797 --> 02:07:51.571
So?

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:53.901
Why do you care?
You’re already married.

02:07:56.002 --> 02:07:58.209
I wouldn't be, if we were together.

02:08:05.745 --> 02:08:07.850
We would be, if you had waited.

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:15.529
But you jumped on the
first guy that came by.

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:16.931
It was very nice of you.

02:08:19.959 --> 02:08:20.699
L-low dare you'?

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:21.665
What are you doing?

02:08:23.029 --> 02:08:24.940
I jumped on the first guy?
ljumpedl!

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.042
You really want to talk
about this right now?

02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:27.840
Yes I think it's high time, don't you?

02:08:29.769 --> 02:08:31.112
You didn’t want to tell your parents.

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:32.945
They would've never accepted it

02:08:33.006 --> 02:08:34.041
and you know that.

02:08:34.707 --> 02:08:35.845
So what was your plan...

02:08:36.009 --> 02:08:36.749
That we run away?

02:08:36.809 --> 02:08:37.810
What else could we have done?

02:08:37.877 --> 02:08:38.685
Are you crazy?

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:41.058
L-low would my father
have faced your parents'?

02:08:41.114 --> 02:08:43.321
And what would they think of me?

02:08:44.017 --> 02:08:44.995
They knew about us.

02:08:45.051 --> 02:08:45.756
Please.

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:47.019
What do you think, Sunny?

02:08:47.687 --> 02:08:49.667
Why did Papa send you to America?

02:08:50.623 --> 02:08:53.661
Not to study but to keep you away from me!

02:08:54.794 --> 02:08:56.796
Did he tell you that?
- Obviously not.

02:08:56.863 --> 02:08:58.900
Then how do you know'?
- Because I know my father!

02:08:58.965 --> 02:08:59.807
Ayesha!

02:08:59.866 --> 02:09:00.776
Then please tell me...

02:09:01.167 --> 02:09:03.579
l-low did he convince you to marry Manav'?

02:09:05.004 --> 02:09:06.950
He didn’t need to...

02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:08.813
Because you did it.

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.987
You know, Ayesha that
is really convenient.

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.215
Everyone is at fault, except you.

02:09:17.083 --> 02:09:17.686
Do you remember...

02:09:18.551 --> 02:09:19.928
l-low many times I called you'?

02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:21.764
I kept telling you

02:09:21.821 --> 02:09:23.596
my parents are pressurizing me...

02:09:23.656 --> 02:09:24.964
Please come back, please come back...

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.202
Why didn't you come back, Sunny?

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:29.870
Ayesha!
I am your fatheﬁs manager's son!

02:09:31.531 --> 02:09:32.976
I wanted to be somebody.

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.907
Somebody your parents would accept.

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:37.038
Don't you get it?

02:09:41.541 --> 02:09:43.282
And why are we talking about this now?

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:46.115
Ivlanav is great.

02:09:46.579 --> 02:09:47.614
You are happy.

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.125
What is the point of this-

02:10:13.006 --> 02:10:16.579
This is the best place for seafood...

02:10:17.577 --> 02:10:18.282
You like fishes?

02:10:19.245 --> 02:10:20.155
You will love them.

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:23.225
No fishes for you!

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:24.955
You're coming with me to King's Bar.

02:10:26.185 --> 02:10:27.823
I want you to meet Farah.

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:30.894
Farah?

02:10:32.058 --> 02:10:33.059
Don't be late.

02:10:33.726 --> 02:10:34.727
I am serious.

02:10:36.796 --> 02:10:37.774
You alright?

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:38.806
Yeah.

02:10:38.865 --> 02:10:39.843
I'll see you there.

02:10:41.201 --> 02:10:42.703
I am coming to King's Bar.

02:10:43.303 --> 02:10:43.974
Divya, please.

02:10:44.303 --> 02:10:46.112
Champagne or me.

02:10:46.172 --> 02:10:47.082
Please choose one.

02:10:47.273 --> 02:10:47.910
Shut up!

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.652
Don't be mean, Rana.

02:10:52.845 --> 02:10:53.823
What was that?

02:10:56.816 --> 02:10:58.022
It was nothing.

02:10:59.652 --> 02:11:01.063
Don’t mess with me, Ayesha...

02:11:01.888 --> 02:11:02.889
You have no idea how difficult it was

02:11:02.956 --> 02:11:04.026
for me to see you again.

02:11:04.257 --> 02:11:05.668
So why did you come?

02:11:05.825 --> 02:11:06.963
What choice did I have?

02:11:08.128 --> 02:11:10.802
Papa was behaving like
it's his last holiday.

02:11:12.165 --> 02:11:12.905
Papa?

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:14.541
Ya...

02:11:16.102 --> 02:11:17.547
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

02:11:18.204 --> 02:11:19.148
I am sorry.

02:11:19.772 --> 02:11:20.546
SO, is that it?

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:21.641
Yes, that's it.

02:11:22.208 --> 02:11:24.984
Go... Live your bachelor
life with your girlfriends.

02:11:25.044 --> 02:11:25.988
Do your thing.

02:11:27.714 --> 02:11:28.715
ls that what you think?

02:11:28.781 --> 02:11:31.091
That's what I hear, so that's what I think.

02:11:32.952 --> 02:11:35.193
L-low can someone so smart be so stupid'?

02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:57.653
Sure you don't want anything?

02:11:58.144 --> 02:11:58.918
Some poison?

02:11:59.312 --> 02:12:00.086
A slap?

02:12:00.179 --> 02:12:01.283
Here you all are!

02:12:01.681 --> 02:12:02.682
Hi!

02:12:03.516 --> 02:12:04.756
Come on, dinner is served.

02:12:04.817 --> 02:12:05.591
Let's go.

02:12:05.752 --> 02:12:09.063
We are not hungry,
in fact we are all working up an appetite.

02:12:09.255 --> 02:12:10.165
Very good.

02:12:10.222 --> 02:12:11.565
Really?

02:12:11.924 --> 02:12:13.528
Kabir. ..

02:12:13.826 --> 02:12:15.032
You sneaky boy!

02:12:15.628 --> 02:12:16.698
When is the big day?

02:12:17.263 --> 02:12:19.072
Sorry... What big day?

02:12:19.899 --> 02:12:21.776
Nice acting, Ayesha!

02:12:22.001 --> 02:12:23.002
We know all about it...

02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:24.707
He is getting married!

02:12:25.571 --> 02:12:26.515
You're getting married'?'?

02:12:27.106 --> 02:12:27.982
To whom?

02:12:28.274 --> 02:12:28.911
To her!

02:12:31.077 --> 02:12:31.919
Kabir. ..

02:12:31.977 --> 02:12:33.752
Nothing like that, Saira Aunty...

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:35.022
Who told you?

02:12:35.281 --> 02:12:36.760
Your lndu Aunty!

02:12:36.816 --> 02:12:39.660
No engagement, they're
directly planning the wedding.

02:12:39.752 --> 02:12:40.059
What?

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:41.293
Come on, let's celebrate!

02:12:41.554 --> 02:12:42.624
I think it's very good they're not

02:12:42.688 --> 02:12:43.860
bothering with an engagement.

02:12:44.223 --> 02:12:45.167
It's a waste of time.

02:12:46.092 --> 02:12:49.164
Don't do it guys, it's a trap!

02:12:55.268 --> 02:12:56.008
Farah!

02:12:57.603 --> 02:12:58.013
Farah...

02:12:58.271 --> 02:12:59.306
Please just stop.

02:12:59.705 --> 02:13:00.183
Please!

02:13:03.142 --> 02:13:04.086
Are you okay'?

02:13:04.110 --> 02:13:06.090
No.
I am not okay.

02:13:06.879 --> 02:13:07.619
What was that?

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.221
Look I am really sorry... I have no idea.

02:13:10.583 --> 02:13:13.029
You people don't talk to each other or what?

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:15.664
You're getting married?

02:13:15.721 --> 02:13:16.597
No babe...

02:13:16.956 --> 02:13:17.866
it's a long story.

02:13:17.957 --> 02:13:20.631
I am not deaf, Kabir.
I heard what your Aunties said.

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.137
Please hear me out too?

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:25.072
It's true that Noorie &
I are getting engaged...

02:13:25.131 --> 02:13:26.109
but there is a reason for that-

02:13:26.165 --> 02:13:27.200
Farah, please wait!

02:13:28.101 --> 02:13:29.273
I am not getting married!

02:13:29.335 --> 02:13:30.837
Go tell Noorie that you asshole!

02:13:30.903 --> 02:13:31.847
Farah, please just listen-

02:13:31.904 --> 02:13:32.678
To what?!

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:35.885
We met, I liked you, we had a fun time.

02:13:36.209 --> 02:13:37.017
I was fine.

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.689
Then this I love you,
I want to be with you...

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:42.157
What was the need to lie?

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:45.352
You made an arse of me, Kabir.

02:13:52.224 --> 02:13:53.168
Whafs going on?

02:13:53.793 --> 02:13:54.635
Nothing...

02:13:54.694 --> 02:13:57.334
Noorie meets Rana, not me.
They are together.

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:59.672
I was trying to help them out.

02:13:59.732 --> 02:14:00.210
The next thing I Know,

02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:02.905
Papa was bribing me with
the plane to marry her.

02:14:03.136 --> 02:14:04.547
And you said yes?

02:14:04.737 --> 02:14:05.681
Are you stupid?

02:14:05.772 --> 02:14:06.910
What about them?

02:14:07.573 --> 02:14:08.847
These are our parents?

02:14:10.209 --> 02:14:11.711
Am I an asset?

02:14:12.145 --> 02:14:13.556
I thought I'd teach them a lesson.

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:15.057
If they can use me for the company,

02:14:15.114 --> 02:14:17.025
I can use them for my plane.

02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:19.120
So what's the difference
between you and them?

02:14:19.185 --> 02:14:19.788
Ayesha, please!

02:14:19.852 --> 02:14:20.956
Cut out the moral science.

02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:22.624
You vvoulcfve done the same thing.

02:14:22.688 --> 02:14:24.099
No! I wouldn't.

02:14:25.057 --> 02:14:27.037
If I don’t agree with them, I tell them.

02:14:27.093 --> 02:14:27.833
Oh really?

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:29.766
Did you tell them about the card?

02:14:29.962 --> 02:14:30.872
Kabir!

02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:32.837
That was not important.

02:14:33.099 --> 02:14:35.170
Can you please just grow up?

02:14:36.102 --> 02:14:37.080
What are you doing?

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:39.846
What do you want to do?

02:14:40.873 --> 02:14:41.613
Think.

02:14:50.282 --> 02:14:52.023
We are not getting married!

02:14:52.318 --> 02:14:53.763
There's been some confusion.

02:14:54.053 --> 02:14:54.963
Don’t you trust me?

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.090
I don't know, you are a Sood.

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:57.199
What is that supposed to mean?!

02:14:57.256 --> 02:14:57.996
You know what I mean!

02:14:58.291 --> 02:14:59.964
You know the problem between our families.

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:01.728
What problem?

02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:03.807
Your aunt was engaged to my uncle

02:15:03.863 --> 02:15:05.672
and one day before the wedding she eloped.

02:15:05.798 --> 02:15:07.641
That's because your sleazy uncle

02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:09.543
was having an affair with his secretary.

02:15:09.602 --> 02:15:10.910
Watch your tongue, she's my aunt now.

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.111
And she didn’t buy my uncle,

02:15:13.172 --> 02:15:15.049
like your dad is buying Kamal Uncle for you.

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:28.230
Please classify my account...

02:15:28.754 --> 02:15:29.061
Q Kay-

02:15:41.267 --> 02:15:41.768
What?

02:15:41.934 --> 02:15:42.275
Shhh!

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:54.022
Shit!

02:15:57.250 --> 02:15:58.194
This is too much.

02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:59.251
Where were you?

02:16:00.052 --> 02:16:01.030
I got a call from Delhi.

02:16:01.087 --> 02:16:02.088
Sit Kamal.

02:16:02.288 --> 02:16:03.062
lndu...

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:04.257
<i>Have you seen Pram?</i>

02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:06.067
I don't see him after 1O pm.

02:16:06.692 --> 02:16:08.797
Don't tell me. He sleeps that early?

02:16:08.861 --> 02:16:09.532
Yes...

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:11.674
And I'm the queen of the night.

02:16:12.165 --> 02:16:14.076
Tell Neelu I went back to the ship.

02:16:14.567 --> 02:16:15.068
Kama! <i>Jr'...</i>

02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:16.705
Please take Putlu with you.

02:16:17.637 --> 02:16:17.944
Come.

02:16:19.005 --> 02:16:19.779
Why?

02:16:19.906 --> 02:16:20.816
It's getting late.

02:16:22.308 --> 02:16:23.286
Good night, everybody.

02:16:23.976 --> 02:16:24.784
Good night, bye!

02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:26.152
Kabir!

02:16:30.816 --> 02:16:32.796
Kamal Uncle saw Rana & me together...

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:35.230
So?

02:16:38.057 --> 02:16:39.968
What were you both doing?

02:16:47.031 --> 02:16:48.204
I'll handle it.

02:16:51.704 --> 02:16:52.580
And Noorie...

02:16:53.305 --> 02:16:55.648
There are 500 rooms on the ship.

02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:11.528
What happened?

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:13.228
Don’t ask...

02:17:15.593 --> 02:17:16.163
Are you okay'?

02:17:17.129 --> 02:17:18.039
Get me some water.

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:19.075
Ya, sure.

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:23.679
Can I get some water?

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:24.210
Sure.

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:31.221
Kamal Uncle!

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:34.019
Sir!

02:17:34.914 --> 02:17:35.892
Sir, are you okay?

02:17:40.019 --> 02:17:40.861
Call the ship...

02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:42.597
Tell them to open the medical centre.

02:17:43.188 --> 02:17:44.599
He may be having a heart attack!

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:45.191
Hurry UP!

02:17:47.893 --> 02:17:48.803
Don't complain...

02:17:49.193 --> 02:17:50.673
You are the luckiest out of the lot!

02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:52.236
I totally agree!

02:17:55.768 --> 02:17:56.575
Hello...

02:17:57.670 --> 02:17:58.080
Hello?

02:18:00.272 --> 02:18:01.046
Yes?

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:14.757
L-low is he'?

02:18:16.022 --> 02:18:16.796
We don’t know...

02:18:18.156 --> 02:18:19.602
Kabir, it's all my fault...

02:18:19.657 --> 02:18:20.966
He was already so stressed and I...

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:22.027
It wasn't you...

02:18:29.235 --> 02:18:30.270
What happened?

02:18:32.805 --> 02:18:34.112
The doctor is with him...

02:18:37.777 --> 02:18:40.257
He's been on anti-anxiety
pills for a few months.

02:18:43.716 --> 02:18:44.786
I didn’t even know.

02:18:47.585 --> 02:18:48.155
Come here.

02:19:24.957 --> 02:19:26.698
There is nothing to worry about.

02:19:27.259 --> 02:19:29.261
It's a severe case of gas.

02:19:30.663 --> 02:19:32.700
We've given him something for the heartburn.

02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:34.175
He'll be fine in a few minutes.

02:19:35.267 --> 02:19:36.245
Excuse me.

02:19:55.587 --> 02:19:58.261
You have no idea what I've been through.

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:06.166
What you've been through?

02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:10.172
You!

02:20:10.903 --> 02:20:12.177
What are you doing?
Stop it!

02:20:12.571 --> 02:20:13.549
You?!

02:20:13.672 --> 02:20:14.650
Stop it!

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.043
Have you ever thought about me?

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:20.817
Should I keep living with the fear

02:20:20.879 --> 02:20:22.517
that you will leave me.

02:20:30.689 --> 02:20:31.895
Yes, one minute.

02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:38.732
Come in.

02:20:43.135 --> 02:20:44.136
You okay?

02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:45.774
Ya, top of the world!

02:20:45.838 --> 02:20:46.578
Mom...

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:49.180
You scared us, Papa.

02:20:50.609 --> 02:20:51.883
I'm glad you are fine.

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:58.152
Listen...

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:03.123
Please forget this Noorie...

02:21:04.089 --> 02:21:04.863
What?

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:06.633
Why?

02:21:06.725 --> 02:21:08.966
She is not serious about Kabir, trust me.

02:21:09.028 --> 02:21:10.029
Meaning?

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:12.872
We've given our word to the Soods.

02:21:14.566 --> 02:21:15.271
Sorry...

02:21:16.735 --> 02:21:18.180
Sorry for everything.

02:21:20.639 --> 02:21:22.084
Don’t be sorry, Papa.

02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:27.956
Actually I never planned to marry Noorie...

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.587
I know about her & Rana...

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:38.232
Noorie, with Rana?

02:21:39.658 --> 02:21:40.659
She likes him.

02:21:40.725 --> 02:21:42.568
They are together...

02:21:43.529 --> 02:21:45.531
I was just helping them out.

02:21:47.599 --> 02:21:48.600
So, I'm sorry.

02:21:49.768 --> 02:21:50.610
You are sorry?

02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:52.906
That's it, you are sorry?

02:21:53.038 --> 02:21:54.210
What is the meaning of sorry now?

02:21:54.773 --> 02:21:55.877
This isn't a joke.

02:21:55.974 --> 02:21:57.920
This is a very serious matter.

02:21:58.276 --> 02:22:00.313
Yes, of course it's serious...

02:22:00.745 --> 02:22:02.725
For you it’s a business deal, right?

02:22:02.781 --> 02:22:04.055
It's not just our business,

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.594
ifs yours too.

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:07.988
It isn't mine...

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:11.191
And I don't want it.

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:13.025
What do you mean you don't want it?

02:22:20.966 --> 02:22:23.503
Now that he is fine and we are talking,

02:22:23.568 --> 02:22:24.911
let's talk openly...

02:22:29.207 --> 02:22:31.517
I don’t want to be the CEO of Ayka.

02:22:34.145 --> 02:22:35.249
I am not good enough.

02:22:36.949 --> 02:22:38.087
I know that.

02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:39.655
You will learn.

02:22:39.718 --> 02:22:40.628
I won’t be able to.

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:43.697
I don’t have what it takes.

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.161
Then what will you do?

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:46.727
I like flying...

02:22:47.959 --> 02:22:49.836
I want to do something in that field.

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:51.672
And our business?

02:22:52.564 --> 02:22:53.668
Should we sell Ayka to someone else?

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:54.273
No...

02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:59.070
Give it to that Ivlehra who
has his business acumen.

02:22:59.771 --> 02:23:01.580
Who deserves it, who is worthy of it.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:02.983
It's called Ayka, right'?

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:04.085
Ayesha-Kabi r.

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:07.018
So if you want to save your company

02:23:07.078 --> 02:23:08.318
let your son go

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:09.957
and bring your daughter back home.

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:11.126
What rubbish!

02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:13.719
She is in her home.

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:14.922
She is miserable.

02:23:14.987 --> 02:23:16.057
Can't you guys see that?

02:23:16.121 --> 02:23:17.794
Don't you care?

02:23:17.856 --> 02:23:18.766
Of course we care!

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:21.137
But do you know what
divorce means in our society?

02:23:21.193 --> 02:23:22.263
It's not easy.

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:25.706
So if I am about to do something difficult,

02:23:26.932 --> 02:23:29.276
you should be even more supportive, right?

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:31.238
What are you talking, Ayesha?

02:23:32.804 --> 02:23:33.748
If you do all this,

02:23:34.239 --> 02:23:35.946
people will talk. You know that.

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:38.120
They are doing that anyway, aren't they?

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:39.781
Whether something happens or not,

02:23:40.579 --> 02:23:41.683
that is what people do-

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:42.816
What are these two saying?

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:45.192
I just don't understand this girl.

02:23:45.684 --> 02:23:46.856
The problem, Neelam...

02:23:47.019 --> 02:23:48.293
is that the morality & values we had,

02:23:48.353 --> 02:23:49.855
don't exist any more.

02:23:50.622 --> 02:23:51.692
Marriage has become a joke.

02:23:52.257 --> 02:23:53.258
Get married today,

02:23:53.325 --> 02:23:54.599
divorced tomorrow!

02:23:56.161 --> 02:23:56.935
Really?

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:01.304
Since when have you been married?

02:24:04.169 --> 02:24:08.049
And what is your morality
and what are your values?

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:08.880
Please tell us.

02:24:09.141 --> 02:24:09.778
Stop it, Kabir!

02:24:09.841 --> 02:24:10.751
Oh, its true.

02:24:12.644 --> 02:24:14.954
Everyone knows about his business trips.

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:20.086
Where he goes, who he
goes with, what he does

02:24:20.151 --> 02:24:22.131
and how you pretend nothing has happened.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.321
Whereas the truth is

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:25.625
you have nowhere else to go...

02:24:36.935 --> 02:24:38.039
l-low dare you'?

02:24:39.071 --> 02:24:40.072
It's the truth.

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:45.617
Please leave.

02:24:45.978 --> 02:24:46.649
No.

02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:48.685
Just get out of here.

02:24:48.747 --> 02:24:50.249
I am not going anywhere.

02:24:50.315 --> 02:24:51.988
Is this how you speak to your father'?

02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:53.324
I am talking to you too.

02:24:53.585 --> 02:24:54.859
Don't talk to me, Kabir.

02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:55.762
Shut up!

02:24:55.821 --> 02:24:57.323
No!
- I don't want to see your face!

02:24:57.589 --> 02:24:58.795
I am not going any where.

02:25:00.692 --> 02:25:02.694
Everyone in this family talks in circles.

02:25:02.761 --> 02:25:04.638
Nothing real is ever said.

02:25:04.696 --> 02:25:05.766
What do you want to say?

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.706
What more is left to say?

02:25:14.973 --> 02:25:16.179
I'm in love with Farah.

02:25:16.241 --> 02:25:18.983
She’s a dancer and she's a Muslim.

02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:52.913
I need to talk to you.

02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:56.987
Farah please... I need to talk to you.

02:25:57.048 --> 02:25:57.788
Not here.

02:25:57.815 --> 02:25:58.816
Then where?

02:25:58.984 --> 02:25:59.724
Back off man.

02:25:59.785 --> 02:26:01.025
Don't mess with me right now!

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:05.764
Listen, I am sorry.

02:26:05.824 --> 02:26:06.734
I screwed up, okay?

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:10.228
I was never going to marry Noorie,

02:26:10.295 --> 02:26:12.241
I was just playing a
stupid game with my Dad.

02:26:12.764 --> 02:26:13.868
Please, I am sorry.

02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:17.279
I love you.

02:26:24.843 --> 02:26:27.016
These games are best played with your dad.

02:26:27.278 --> 02:26:28.621
This is my place of work...

02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:29.681
Get out!

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:52.772
They hate us...

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:59.588
No... I don't think they hate us.

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:00.679
Why didn’t you leave me?

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:11.896
You heard Kabir...

02:27:15.093 --> 02:27:17.164
I had nowhere to go.

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.841
Will you be able to forgive me?

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:40.127
You forgot me, Kamal.

02:27:49.894 --> 02:27:50.872
I'm sorry.

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:54.232
I'm really sorry.
I never forgot you, Neelu

02:27:56.068 --> 02:27:56.978
Never.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.847
<i>Why do human beings forget to tell</i>

02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:07.618
<i>each other things
when they are together?</i>

02:28:10.682 --> 02:28:12.059
<i>And why is it</i>

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:15.593
<i>that they always
remember the unsaid things</i>

02:28:16.555 --> 02:28:20.697
when someone is gone?

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:24.970
<i>Why does the right
thing only come to them</i>

02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:27.539
<i>when its too fate?</i>

02:28:33.605 --> 02:28:34.913
Everyone is gossiping...

02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:38.143
This girl doesn’t care about herself

02:28:38.677 --> 02:28:40.588
or her fami|y’s reputation.

02:28:41.613 --> 02:28:43.957
Why have I lived to see this day?

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:46.895
All these years we invested in her...

02:28:47.686 --> 02:28:49.188
Invested in me means?

02:28:50.188 --> 02:28:51.792
Did I say something wrong?

02:28:52.324 --> 02:28:53.667
Did I upset you?

02:28:54.692 --> 02:28:55.830
Are you angry?

02:28:56.261 --> 02:28:56.864
Tell me?

02:28:57.595 --> 02:28:58.073
Tell me...

02:28:58.930 --> 02:29:01.774
I'm not allowed to
speak in my own house.

02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:03.272
So you only say something...

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:05.273
Why are you quiet'?

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:06.910
Okay, fine.

02:29:07.205 --> 02:29:09.116
If I upset you, then please...

02:29:09.707 --> 02:29:10.685
Please forgive me.

02:29:11.843 --> 02:29:14.016
If this is not good
enough, then I will-

02:29:14.746 --> 02:29:16.191
I will kill myself!

02:29:17.015 --> 02:29:18.119
Will that make you happy?

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:18.887
Mom, please-

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:20.686
Ivlanav...

02:29:22.086 --> 02:29:23.190
This is what she wants!

02:29:23.855 --> 02:29:24.526
Smita ji...

02:29:26.091 --> 02:29:26.728
Aunty...

02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:30.004
That's a butter knife.

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:31.264
What?

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.642
That is a butter knife.

02:29:34.532 --> 02:29:35.272
Kabir!

02:29:35.834 --> 02:29:36.608
Take this.

02:29:36.968 --> 02:29:38.003
This will be better.

02:29:39.537 --> 02:29:40.208
Hold it like this...

02:29:41.205 --> 02:29:41.979
And cut like this.

02:29:43.041 --> 02:29:43.712
Lengthwise.

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:47.188
L-low dare you speak to
my mother like that'?

02:29:48.012 --> 02:29:49.218
I am just helping her-

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:49.815
Kabir!

02:29:51.049 --> 02:29:51.754
Apologize.

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:54.594
Now.

02:29:55.253 --> 02:29:55.924
Sorry...

02:29:58.322 --> 02:29:59.699
This is ridiculous!

02:30:01.126 --> 02:30:02.070
This is my marriage.

02:30:02.994 --> 02:30:04.803
And this is my fami|y’s
personal matter.

02:30:06.598 --> 02:30:07.235
I have had enough.

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:08.004
Mom.

02:30:08.767 --> 02:30:09.711
We should go back.

02:30:10.569 --> 02:30:10.876
Come on.

02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:12.714
Ayesha, pack up your bags... Let's go.

02:30:12.904 --> 02:30:15.214
Manav, I can't leave.
it's my parents' anniversary.

02:30:17.742 --> 02:30:18.117
Ayesha. ..

02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:22.249
Don’t make me force you, alright?

02:30:22.914 --> 02:30:23.187
Let's go.

02:30:23.881 --> 02:30:24.222
Oy!

02:30:26.084 --> 02:30:27.154
Easy, tiger-

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:27.821
Shut up!

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:31.258
This is between me and my wife.

02:30:33.558 --> 02:30:33.933
Get up!

02:30:34.893 --> 02:30:35.997
Ivlanav you are making a scene.

02:30:36.161 --> 02:30:37.037
Get up!

02:30:37.762 --> 02:30:38.968
Ivlanav. .. Stop it!

02:30:39.598 --> 02:30:40.269
Get up!

02:30:43.735 --> 02:30:44.179
Papa!

02:30:50.041 --> 02:30:52.078
What do you think you’re doing?

02:30:56.948 --> 02:30:59.622
If you even raise a
finger at my daughter...

02:31:00.685 --> 02:31:03.029
I'll rip your arm out
and throw it into the sea.

02:31:03.088 --> 02:31:04.658
Do you understand?

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:25.185
Please take your son and
leave as soon as possible.

02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:29.619
Please go.

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:33.193
You are making a mistake, Kamal ji.

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:36.725
I made a mistake many years ago.

02:31:57.542 --> 02:31:58.020
Papa!

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:00.579
Papa...

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:05.889
I am sorry.

02:32:07.986 --> 02:32:08.862
I am really sorry.

02:32:49.294 --> 02:32:50.671
Isn't this Farah's room?

02:32:51.529 --> 02:32:52.633
She left.

02:32:53.798 --> 02:32:54.868
She got fired.

02:32:56.201 --> 02:32:57.578
She got off an hour ago.

02:33:27.098 --> 02:33:27.940
I need to get off.

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:29.744
Sir, the ship is
sailing... lam sorry!

02:33:32.137 --> 02:33:32.774
Hello, ma'm!

02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.844
I need to get off the ship.

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.143
I am sorry, sir.
You can't get off.

02:33:35.206 --> 02:33:36.184
I don't need to come back.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:37.150
I just need to get off the ship.

02:33:37.242 --> 02:33:39.017
Ya, but the ship just pulled out-

02:33:39.076 --> 02:33:40.282
No, no, m'am, you don't understand.

02:33:40.344 --> 02:33:41.914
It's an emergency, I
need to get off the ship.

02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:42.890
Please stop the ship & let me off.

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.254
It is a security issue...

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:45.993
I'll give you a security issue,

02:33:46.017 --> 02:33:46.927
just let me off the ship!

02:33:47.318 --> 02:33:48.160
What's the problem, Sir?

02:33:48.252 --> 02:33:48.992
It's an emergency...

02:33:49.087 --> 02:33:50.623
It's imperative I get
off the ship right now.

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:51.257
Please stop the ship.

02:33:52.023 --> 02:33:53.366
Stop the ship!
- Sir, calm down.

02:33:53.658 --> 02:33:54.693
You don't tell me to calm down!

02:33:55.193 --> 02:33:56.604
Tell him!

02:33:58.963 --> 02:33:59.737
What are you doing?

02:33:59.864 --> 02:34:01.810
Farah has left and they are
not letting me off the ship.

02:34:02.066 --> 02:34:03.204
So get off at the next port...

02:34:03.268 --> 02:34:04.804
The next port is in Greece.

02:34:04.869 --> 02:34:05.870
L-low will I find her, Sunny'?

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:07.781
What do you mean loco?

02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:09.878
Listen, calm down.

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:12.686
If there is an emergency on the ship,

02:34:13.077 --> 02:34:14.181
they must be having a procedure.

02:34:15.113 --> 02:34:17.059
They won't stop the
ship without a reason.

02:34:18.049 --> 02:34:19.119
Okay?

02:34:28.626 --> 02:34:29.730
I love you.

02:34:33.064 --> 02:34:34.771
Ayesha is getting a divorce...

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:54.295
Get ready...

02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:56.898
We have to do this right now.

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:02.261
Excuse me, everybody...

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.561
I need your attention, please.

02:35:03.895 --> 02:35:06.034
Quiet everyone!

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:07.700
Kabir wants to make a toasts.

02:35:09.567 --> 02:35:10.068
Thank you, Vinod Uncle.

02:35:11.602 --> 02:35:14.048
Actually I am not
here to make a toast.

02:35:14.906 --> 02:35:16.078
I am here to apologize.

02:35:18.743 --> 02:35:19.016
Noorie...

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:22.990
You are one hell of a woman.

02:35:25.316 --> 02:35:27.193
I love you
and you will always be my friend.

02:35:28.286 --> 02:35:29.697
But I can’t marry you...

02:35:29.754 --> 02:35:31.062
Because I am in love
with someone else...

02:35:40.198 --> 02:35:41.176
I am sorry, Noorie...

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.707
Noorie!

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:47.840
Noorie...

02:35:49.173 --> 02:35:50.117
You stay away from her.

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:52.177
Get her here...

02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:54.189
Give her air!

02:35:54.312 --> 02:35:55.188
Please get some water...

02:36:01.719 --> 02:36:02.595
What the hell...

02:36:02.921 --> 02:36:03.899
ls this?

02:36:07.892 --> 02:36:08.529
Kamal...

02:36:08.927 --> 02:36:09.962
Did you know about this?

02:36:10.795 --> 02:36:12.570
He knows nothing about
this, Lalit uncle.

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.140
I am really sorry, I-

02:36:14.265 --> 02:36:15.141
You are sorry now?

02:36:15.799 --> 02:36:16.209
You are sorry?

02:36:16.634 --> 02:36:18.011
Sorry it had to happen this way.

02:36:18.970 --> 02:36:20.540
Happen this way, happen that way...

02:36:20.571 --> 02:36:23.609
Kabir, what you have
done is not correct.

02:36:24.809 --> 02:36:26.914
You did this to a sweet
girl like Noorie...

02:36:28.146 --> 02:36:28.920
It's bad!

02:36:30.714 --> 02:36:32.557
I am sorry, I had no choice.

02:36:35.653 --> 02:36:36.961
I respect Noorie too much.

02:36:37.021 --> 02:36:38.967
I can’t lie to her...

02:36:44.796 --> 02:36:47.800
The girl I am in love
with has lost her job,

02:36:48.566 --> 02:36:49.636
asked to get off the ship...

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:50.738
Because of me.

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:54.081
I have to go and find her.

02:36:59.243 --> 02:37:01.587
Papa, can I rely on you?

02:37:03.681 --> 02:37:05.820
Papa, can I rely on you?

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:08.995
Yes...

02:37:09.087 --> 02:37:10.065
Good.

02:37:11.122 --> 02:37:13.159
Because you are my lifeboat.

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:14.967
What?

02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:16.936
Where are you going?

02:37:24.836 --> 02:37:26.315
Kabir, that's not what I meant!

02:37:30.041 --> 02:37:31.645
Noorie!

02:37:56.166 --> 02:37:57.076
Sunny, where is he?

02:37:57.268 --> 02:37:58.008
I don't know.

02:38:00.137 --> 02:38:01.343
Man overboard! Starboard Side.

02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:05.846
Kamal uncle!

02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:07.145
There... There he is!

02:38:08.746 --> 02:38:09.087
Stop the ship.

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:11.287
Go, stop the ship!

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:11.753
Q Kay-

02:38:15.819 --> 02:38:16.695
Stop engines.

02:38:17.521 --> 02:38:19.660
Oscar! Oscar!

02:38:20.658 --> 02:38:23.195
Starboard side.

02:38:27.665 --> 02:38:29.042
Someone stop this ship!

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:30.870
Where is this Oscar?

02:38:31.135 --> 02:38:32.546
My child is drowning!

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:34.808
Oscar means they are
going to send a lifeboat.

02:38:36.006 --> 02:38:36.950
They will save him, Kamal Uncle.

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:37.878
Lifeboat...

02:38:38.909 --> 02:38:39.887
He said I am his life boat...

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:40.678
What?

02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:43.022
I'm his lifeboat.

02:38:43.681 --> 02:38:44.216
I have to go!

02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:45.959
The lifeboat is up there.

02:38:46.684 --> 02:38:47.025
There...

02:38:47.184 --> 02:38:47.855
Get it down...

02:38:48.152 --> 02:38:49.222
Do something please, Kamal!

02:38:50.154 --> 02:38:51.633
Just get the lifeboat downl!

02:38:51.755 --> 02:38:53.257
Don't worry, they're coming!

02:38:53.891 --> 02:38:55.131
They will arrest him!

02:38:57.294 --> 02:38:58.295
Just do as I say!

02:38:58.562 --> 02:38:59.734
L-low do we get this down'?

02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:01.169
How?

02:39:01.232 --> 02:39:03.041
Figure it out!

02:39:03.935 --> 02:39:04.913
Pull the rope!

02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:07.705
Lalit, be careful!

02:39:12.977 --> 02:39:14.047
Nothing's happening!

02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:15.555
Check up there.

02:39:23.621 --> 02:39:24.565
Kamal Uncle!

02:39:26.557 --> 02:39:26.898
There!

02:39:27.157 --> 02:39:28.227
Lifeboat!

02:39:31.996 --> 02:39:32.804
Hey!

02:39:33.297 --> 02:39:34.173
Excuse me!

02:39:42.006 --> 02:39:42.882
Stop!

02:39:44.775 --> 02:39:46.584
Officer, I need this boat!

02:39:46.644 --> 02:39:47.714
Sir, you can't enter!

02:39:47.778 --> 02:39:48.950
It's his life, officer!

02:39:48.979 --> 02:39:49.753
Back up!

02:39:49.847 --> 02:39:51.019
I'll pay you as much as you want.

02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:51.923
Back up now.

02:39:52.016 --> 02:39:52.858
They are not listening!

02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:07.670
Sorry officer, nothing personals.

02:40:08.198 --> 02:40:09.074
Just 5 minutes...

02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:10.501
Leave me!

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:13.837
Where are you going?

02:40:14.138 --> 02:40:15.116
I have to take him to the port, Neelu.

02:40:15.539 --> 02:40:16.847
If they catch him, they'll arrest him.

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:17.848
I have to go!

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:19.545
Even I'm coming.
- Not right now!

02:40:19.643 --> 02:40:20.246
Then when?!

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:21.854
Fine! Come!

02:40:24.515 --> 02:40:25.050
Bhaf Saab!

02:40:25.883 --> 02:40:27.590
Should I also come?
- No, no you stay here...

02:40:27.885 --> 02:40:28.955
Look after the guests, okay?

02:40:29.286 --> 02:40:30.526
I'll handle everything here.

02:40:30.588 --> 02:40:31.589
You don't worry.

02:40:38.095 --> 02:40:39.631
Noorie, where's Mom?

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:43.275
Papa!

02:40:44.168 --> 02:40:45.977
Step back!

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:47.741
Sorry, I've got to go!

02:40:50.641 --> 02:40:51.551
Pluto, out!

02:40:52.609 --> 02:40:53.952
Ayesha, he won't go!

02:40:54.678 --> 02:40:55.247
Are you okay'?

02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:56.849
Yes...

02:40:57.148 --> 02:40:57.751
No...

02:40:57.848 --> 02:40:58.918
I don't know...

02:41:00.718 --> 02:41:01.696
Everybody hang on.

02:41:12.663 --> 02:41:13.141
Sunny!

02:41:15.699 --> 02:41:16.871
Will you wait for me?

02:41:19.536 --> 02:41:20.776
Dammit Sunny, say something...

02:41:20.804 --> 02:41:22.078
Will you wait for me?

02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:24.046
Forever!

02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:47.703
Papa, do you know how this works'?

02:41:47.765 --> 02:41:49.244
I used to drive a truck...

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:50.142
l-low hard can this be'?

02:41:50.234 --> 02:41:51.076
Kamal, please!

02:42:11.655 --> 02:42:12.793
There he is, Papa!

02:42:15.593 --> 02:42:16.901
Careful Kamal, don't kill my son!

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:22.503
Kabir!

02:42:41.685 --> 02:42:42.663
Careful!

02:42:51.762 --> 02:42:52.137
Mom!

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:54.004
Are you crazy!

02:43:06.076 --> 02:43:08.147
Papa, the guards are coming!

02:43:08.579 --> 02:43:10.024
They're coming! Go, go, go!

02:43:11.182 --> 02:43:12.126
<i>Hurry up, Kama“.!</i>

02:43:13.984 --> 02:43:15.258
Come on! Go!

02:43:18.556 --> 02:43:19.557
Why are you not starting?

02:43:19.623 --> 02:43:20.328
What is the problem?

02:43:20.724 --> 02:43:21.634
Mama, please relax!

02:43:21.859 --> 02:43:22.803
You just shut up!

02:43:26.063 --> 02:43:27.098
We need to go, Papa!

02:43:28.332 --> 02:43:29.310
They're almost here.

02:43:29.934 --> 02:43:30.639
Down boy.

02:43:45.649 --> 02:43:47.686
Are they really going to arrest us?

02:43:47.751 --> 02:43:48.661
Obviously, Neelu.

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:51.258
But after we drop
this fool to the port.

02:44:11.108 --> 02:44:12.985
<i>H wasrYt just Kabir
who got saved today.</i>

02:44:13.611 --> 02:44:15.147
<i>My who/e family has been rescued.</i>

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:18.554
<i>I had never seen them this happy</i>

02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:21.789
<i>and headed in the
same direction before.</i>

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:29.867
<i>They say</i> a <i>leopard
can? change his spots</i>

02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:34.974

02:44:37.034 --> 02:44:38.945
<i>Now look at my own family.</i>

02:44:39.570 --> 02:44:43.211
<i>Today they've learnt that
love, alone, is not enough.</i>

02:44:43.807 --> 02:44:47.687
<i>If you love someone, you
have to set them free.</i>

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:53.860
<i>Free to be, free to Hve differently.</i>

02:44:54.785 --> 02:44:56.787

02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:04.901
<i>there is just water around us.</i>

02:45:05.028 --> 02:45:07.235
<i>Or that our boat is really small.</i>

02:45:08.031 --> 02:45:10.671
We are together.

02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:12.878
<i>We are for each other.</i>

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:15.776
What else does one want?

02:46:08.025 --> 02:46:10.631
