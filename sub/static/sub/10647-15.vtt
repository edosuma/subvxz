00:01.434 --> 00:03.235
SPIDER-MAN:
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

00:07.490 --> 00:08.980
Carnage is destroyed,

00:09.026 --> 00:11.584
everyone is safe and
catching up on their nap time.

00:11.630 --> 00:13.562
I've known you forever, Harry,
but even I'm surprised

00:13.608 --> 00:15.030
you could do all this.

00:18.334 --> 00:21.503
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you're one to talk
about surprising people,

00:21.549 --> 00:23.705
Spider-Man. Touche.

00:24.541 --> 00:25.707
It's been a day.

00:25.753 --> 00:27.276
Morbius and Hydra
caused an outbreak

00:27.322 --> 00:29.567
with their brilliant idea,
the Carnage Bomb.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.770
Which, I have to admit,
was pretty accurately named.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.416
<i>It took over most of New York</i>
<i>until Harry, my best friend,</i>

00:34.462 --> 00:37.152
<i>managed to destroy it</i>
<i>with the Anti-Venom symbiote.</i>

00:37.198 --> 00:38.858
<i>And in the process,</i>

00:38.904 --> 00:41.146
<i>I kind of revealed</i>
<i>my secret identity to him.</i>

00:41.192 --> 00:44.092
I couldn't have done it
without your inspiration, Peter.

00:44.138 --> 00:46.750
- Seriously.
- Hey, let's not get all sincere here.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.131
It goes against our pizza
and videogames friendship.

00:49.177 --> 00:51.941
(GRUNTING)

00:52.064 --> 00:54.425
Flash, you can have pizza too.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.572
I'm not opposed to group activity.
(SQUISHING)

00:56.618 --> 00:57.939
Uh-oh.

01:03.346 --> 01:07.145
(GRUNTS)  The Carnage symbiote.
What's it doing?

01:07.191 --> 01:10.085
It's New York. I've seen
some pretty crazy parades.

01:10.131 --> 01:11.453
But this?

01:12.355 --> 01:13.789
(GRUNTS)

01:17.427 --> 01:19.150
Oh, come on. Really?

01:19.196 --> 01:20.862
What's it take
to beat this thing?

01:20.908 --> 01:22.469
<i>Anyone still trying to evacuate,</i>

01:22.515 --> 01:24.490
<i>the Brooklyn Bridge is open and clear.</i>

01:24.536 --> 01:28.376
<i>I repeat, the Brooklyn Bridge
has not been blocked or damaged.</i>

01:28.422 --> 01:30.439
Harry, we gotta get you
to safety.

01:30.485 --> 01:32.864
No. I'm gonna help, like MJ.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.264
She's safe at Midtown High.

01:34.310 --> 01:35.500
You're in too much
danger out here

01:35.562 --> 01:38.113
without the Anti-Venom
symbiote protecting you.

01:40.681 --> 01:43.834
You and Venom might be
the only two heroes this city has left.

01:43.887 --> 01:45.620
I'll see if I can find
you some help.

01:46.508 --> 01:48.890
I hope he doesn't do
anything stupid.

01:50.059 --> 01:51.693
It's coming back together.

01:55.888 --> 01:57.518
I don't know what
that thing's doing.

01:57.564 --> 02:00.702
But I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
we need to stop it before it starts.

02:00.748 --> 02:02.437
It's just a big ball of goop.

02:02.483 --> 02:04.573
It can't be that dangerous.

02:06.643 --> 02:08.910
(ROARS)

02:11.080 --> 02:12.581
I think it can.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.397
So, this is happening.

02:28.443 --> 02:34.236
Carnage is chaos.

02:37.507 --> 02:38.773
(GRUNTING)

02:39.776 --> 02:41.432
Any ideas, Spidey?

02:41.478 --> 02:44.279
Just one. Stop this thing
with everything we've got left.

02:44.325 --> 02:46.214
Oh, why didn't I
think of that?

02:49.118 --> 02:50.275

In your face, ugly.

02:57.628 --> 03:00.061
Let's wash that down
with some missiles.

That'll teach you to mess with...

(YELLS)

03:09.105 --> 03:11.403
(GROWLS)

03:12.975 --> 03:14.331
VENOM:
Where's he going?

03:14.377 --> 03:16.511
Everything over there
should be evacuated,

03:16.557 --> 03:18.480
except for...
- Oh, no!

03:18.526 --> 03:20.404
Midtown High!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.651
I almost lost one of my
closest friends to this thing.

03:22.697 --> 03:24.386
It's not gonna take another.

03:27.390 --> 03:28.890
(SHOUTS)

03:32.495 --> 03:33.995
Chew on this!

03:36.699 --> 03:38.600
Carnage

03:38.646 --> 03:42.859
is chaos.

03:42.905 --> 03:44.339
Ugh!

03:44.807 --> 03:46.274
Did we do that?

03:47.076 --> 03:49.077
SPIDER-MAN:
We didn't hit it that hard.

03:49.123 --> 03:51.146
You're saying he gave up
on his own?

03:51.192 --> 03:52.836
Ha. Wimp.

03:53.371 --> 03:56.273
Something drew Monster McUgly
to our old school.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.687
I think there's more going
on here than it seems.

03:58.711 --> 04:00.355
We gotta find MJ.

04:06.429 --> 04:08.852
Ugh. This is just like
that dream I used to have

04:08.898 --> 04:10.881
where our school turned
into a vampire's stomach.

04:10.927 --> 04:12.434
You had that dream too?

04:12.480 --> 04:13.991
- I was joking.
- Oh.

04:14.037 --> 04:15.670
Oh, yeah. Yeah, me too.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.640
The Media Lab's this way.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.625

04:21.671 --> 04:22.611
You hear that?

04:22.657 --> 04:24.402
Uh, yeah. Be careful.

04:24.448 --> 04:27.549
Could be some kind
of gross Carnage egg sack or...

04:30.920 --> 04:32.377
Stan?

04:32.423 --> 04:33.688
I didn't work my way

04:33.734 --> 04:36.481
up to principal just to use
a mop again.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.428
But my new janitor
couldn't come in today.

04:39.474 --> 04:42.520
Why? They said the city's
under attack.

04:42.566 --> 04:45.834
(CHUCKLES)  I said, "Yeah, just sounds
like a Thursday to me."

04:46.702 --> 04:48.169
(SHOUTS)

04:48.938 --> 04:49.967
(GRUNTS)

04:50.013 --> 04:51.329
You gotta get out of here.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.642
The school's come to life,
and it is not happy.

04:53.688 --> 04:56.878
No way, Spider-Man.
I'm no coward.

04:56.924 --> 04:58.580
I'm an educator.

04:58.626 --> 05:00.615
(GRUNTING)

05:01.751 --> 05:04.052
(GRUNTS)
No!

05:06.289 --> 05:08.056
Getting shoved into a locker?

05:08.102 --> 05:09.591
I probably deserve this.

05:09.637 --> 05:10.892
Whoa.

05:11.961 --> 05:14.101
(SCREAMS)

05:14.147 --> 05:15.614
Oh, come on.

05:15.660 --> 05:19.267
Carnage turned this into the world's
most disgusting dodge ball game?

05:20.336 --> 05:23.136
(GRUNTS)

05:23.182 --> 05:26.564
Taste a little mop-fu,
creepy-crawlies.

05:26.610 --> 05:29.311
Never let it be said
that old Stan

05:29.357 --> 05:33.214
tried to shirk
his academic responsibilities.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.518
(BELL RINGS)
Aah! The school bell?

05:36.564 --> 05:39.287
Really? Now, this is just annoying.

(AGENT VENOM GRUNTING)

05:43.858 --> 05:45.983
Uh, is your buddy okay?

05:46.029 --> 05:48.397
Oh, boy. If there's
one thing he hates,

05:48.488 --> 05:49.931
it's loud noises.

05:49.977 --> 05:51.989

I hate you, stupid bell!

06:01.678 --> 06:03.244
I always hated you.

06:03.290 --> 06:09.060
Always ringing and making me
late, and it ends now! Yeah!

06:09.106 --> 06:12.120
I'm gonna have to
write you up for that.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.380
(CACKLING)

06:15.426 --> 06:18.132
Stan, I'm serious. It's time
for you to get to safety.

06:18.178 --> 06:22.030
You know, I think I'm seeing
the wisdom in your advice.

06:22.076 --> 06:24.299
Chaos. Chaos. Chaos.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.805
Still haven't forgotten
the SHIELD exit plans in this place.

06:30.851 --> 06:35.643
Good luck, Spider-Man.
Excelsior!

Ouch.

06:42.337 --> 06:45.376
For little guys, these things hurt.

06:45.422 --> 06:46.988
They're affecting you
like the Anti-Venom did.

06:47.034 --> 06:49.224
Looks like Carnage got
some kind of makeover.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.982
Just great.

06:51.028 --> 06:53.295
I always dreamed my return
to Midtown High

06:53.341 --> 06:54.596
would be triumphant.

06:54.642 --> 06:58.833
But this? This is
just the worst!

06:58.879 --> 07:00.101
(GRUNTS)

07:03.372 --> 07:06.475
(SIGHS) Well, let's hope
that's the last of those guys.

07:06.521 --> 07:08.677
Now... Wait.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.446
Footprints?

07:11.492 --> 07:13.348
MJ?
(GRUNTS)

07:16.336 --> 07:18.235
SPIDER-MAN:
Mary Jane Watson?

07:18.281 --> 07:19.744
We've gotta get you
out of here.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.189
This whole place...

07:21.891 --> 07:23.324
Uh-oh.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.217
Dr. Morbius?

07:26.263 --> 07:28.530
You, uh, do something
new with your hair?

07:28.576 --> 07:29.864
Where is she?

07:29.910 --> 07:32.823
I promised Hydra a masterpiece.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.159
- What's he talking about?
- No clue.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.072
Guess his looks weren't
the only thing distorted.

07:37.118 --> 07:39.564
You dare mock me?

07:39.610 --> 07:41.776
If you do not have what I need,

07:41.822 --> 07:46.170
then I have no use for you.
(GROWLING)

07:46.216 --> 07:47.415
Oh, boy.

07:48.450 --> 07:51.252
Watch out! Morbius
has gone batty.

07:52.018 --> 07:53.988
Wow. Did I really just say that?

07:54.034 --> 07:57.392
Remember when you wanted
a sample of my symbiote?

07:57.438 --> 07:59.460
Let me give you one.

08:01.184 --> 08:03.531
(GRUNTING)

08:05.301 --> 08:08.826
I used to get so much
lunch money with this move.

08:08.872 --> 08:12.040
The metamorphosis
Dr. Octopus put me through

08:12.086 --> 08:14.514
changed more than just
my appearance.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.978
For example...

08:17.480 --> 08:18.503
(GROANING)

08:18.549 --> 08:22.550
I can now drain
the life energy from any being.

(GRUNTS, YELLS)

08:25.443 --> 08:28.890
Somehow, I doubt that
party trick makes you many friends.

08:33.044 --> 08:36.654
- Two spiders for one?
- How efficient.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.902
You'll stand in the way
of my greatest creation no longer.

08:40.948 --> 08:43.171

08:45.307 --> 08:46.663

08:53.429 --> 08:55.784
You're done, B-movie reject.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.719
Another young hero.

08:57.765 --> 08:59.489
So full of life.

08:59.535 --> 09:01.422
For now.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.436
What? I don't understand.

09:05.482 --> 09:07.312
It's not magic, Morbius.

09:07.358 --> 09:09.764
You're just using
the science of energy transfer.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.274
And guess what? This armor's
designed to protect

09:12.352 --> 09:14.147
from all kinds of power drainage.

09:14.193 --> 09:15.756
Don't worry. You'll have
plenty of time

09:15.802 --> 09:17.939
to analyze that data
where you're going.

09:17.985 --> 09:20.308
(SNARLING)

09:20.380 --> 09:22.677
Ah, the cavalry.

09:22.723 --> 09:24.149
Huh?

09:24.195 --> 09:25.763
How many flavors
of Carnage are there?

09:25.809 --> 09:29.322
Just as I hoped.
They're evolving on their own.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.710
Good luck, Spider-Man.

09:31.756 --> 09:34.382
Let's get out of here!
(GRUNTS)

09:34.428 --> 09:36.357
This won't hold them for long.

09:38.053 --> 09:39.653
I will find her.

09:39.699 --> 09:43.261
I will search this school
until I find the Queen.

09:43.307 --> 09:46.742
Queen? Prom's not for another
two months, weirdo.

09:46.788 --> 09:51.239
Here they come.
-Let's move!  (GRUNTS)

09:53.834 --> 09:56.071
Harry, not that I'm not
grateful for the save,

09:56.117 --> 09:57.876
but what are you doing here?

09:57.922 --> 09:59.948
I told you I was going for help.

09:59.994 --> 10:02.720
I'm the help. I got my armor
from Oscorp

10:02.766 --> 10:04.239
and got here as fast
as I could.

10:04.285 --> 10:05.647
You've kind of been
through a lot today.

10:05.693 --> 10:08.322
This is probably not a good idea.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.358
Mary Jane's my friend too.

10:10.406 --> 10:13.027
(GRUNTING)

10:18.405 --> 10:19.502
(LAUGHS)

10:19.548 --> 10:21.859
This is awesome!

10:21.905 --> 10:24.072
Awesome?  Are you
in a different fight than me?

10:24.118 --> 10:26.027
Because I'm in the really,
really gross one.

10:26.073 --> 10:29.303
No. I mean it's awesome that
the three of us are here,

10:29.349 --> 10:31.436
in our old school, reunited

10:31.482 --> 10:33.948
to fight side by side
to save one of our own.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.690
Hey, can we call ourselves
the Midtown Marauders?

10:37.736 --> 10:39.404
You've been saving that name
for years, haven't you?

10:39.450 --> 10:41.489
No. Maybe.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.416
There! The Media Lab.

10:44.462 --> 10:46.361
That's where MJ
was supposed to be.

10:46.407 --> 10:48.686
(GRUNTING)

10:48.732 --> 10:50.231
Stand back.

10:56.395 --> 10:58.651
And stay out!

10:58.697 --> 11:00.726
Uh, did we just shut them out,

11:00.772 --> 11:03.211
or did we just shut
ourselves in?

11:05.426 --> 11:07.882
PATRIOTEER:
Are those hives?

11:14.174 --> 11:18.272
Ugh! And I thought today
had already maxed out on creepiness.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.679
We have to destroy this place
before more of those things hatch.

11:20.725 --> 11:22.263
WOMAN: Who's there?

11:24.043 --> 11:25.366
Mary Jane?

11:25.412 --> 11:27.124
We came to get you out of here.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.303
Your friends are
really worried about you.

11:33.015 --> 11:36.577
We have to get out of here.
The Carnages are out of control.

11:36.879 --> 11:39.105
Not anymore.

11:39.151 --> 11:42.517
The Carnage Queen
is in complete control.

11:42.563 --> 11:45.253
Carnage is order.

11:45.654 --> 11:46.783
Uh-oh.

11:46.829 --> 11:48.251
Fantastic.

11:48.297 --> 11:51.137
Another one of my friends
has been drawn into my fight.

11:51.183 --> 11:54.238
Flash, Harry, Miles,
even Aunt May.

11:54.284 --> 11:58.188
Now MJ's turned
into a... a... something.

11:58.234 --> 11:59.325
Oh, it's official.

11:59.371 --> 12:02.609
Being friends with me is
the most dangerous thing you can do.

12:02.655 --> 12:06.319
Are you the ones
angering my pets?

12:06.365 --> 12:08.816
Mary Jane, I know
you're in there.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.516
You've gotta fight this.

12:10.562 --> 12:12.613
Harry was able to conquer
his symbiote,

12:12.659 --> 12:15.850
and you can too.
(GRUNTING)

12:16.575 --> 12:20.156
I am not just
another symbiote.

12:20.202 --> 12:21.845
(GROWLS)

12:21.891 --> 12:23.491
(GRUNTS)

12:24.093 --> 12:25.693
(YELLS)

12:26.095 --> 12:27.395
(GRUNTS)

12:28.464 --> 12:30.564
(GROWLS)
Huh?

12:32.239 --> 12:33.968
There you are.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.060
My masterpiece.

12:36.106 --> 12:37.294
Do you recognize me?

12:37.340 --> 12:38.621
I am your creator,

12:38.667 --> 12:40.863
Dr. Michael Morbius.

12:40.909 --> 12:43.086
Your host body
had contact with Venom,

12:43.132 --> 12:45.053
Anti-Venom, and Carnage,

12:45.099 --> 12:48.079
making you the perfect vessel
for the Queen.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.658
I am not a creation.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.827
I am a creator.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.240
Attack all the intruders!

12:57.580 --> 12:58.966
All the intruders?

12:59.234 --> 13:00.945
You should know,
we're not with that guy.

13:03.228 --> 13:05.984
No one will survive
my wrath.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.375
(GRUNTING)

13:07.421 --> 13:09.354
Not sure how to tell her,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.656
but I'm not really into
Mary Jane's new look.

13:12.702 --> 13:14.577
I kind of like it.
BOTH: Huh?

13:14.623 --> 13:18.477
What? I don't want her to be
the Carnage Queen. It's just a cool look.

13:18.523 --> 13:22.233
Jeez. I like what I like.
(GRUNTS)

13:26.359 --> 13:28.359
We all know Mary Jane's
got a will of iron.

13:28.405 --> 13:31.665
If we can somehow reach her
inside the Carnage Queen, we have a chance.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.204
Relying on "ifs," Spider-Man?

13:34.250 --> 13:37.815
That is why you fail
where I succeed.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.017
(GRUNTS)

13:47.879 --> 13:50.651
(SHRIEKS)

13:51.661 --> 13:53.779
I thought you'd be
uncontrollable,

13:53.825 --> 13:56.167
so of course I have
a contingency.

13:57.529 --> 13:59.170
What is your bidding?

14:00.135 --> 14:01.605
Huh?

14:02.504 --> 14:05.009
Subdue our tormentors.

14:07.666 --> 14:08.702
Yes.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.048
Mary Jane, stop!

14:12.732 --> 14:14.686
Mary Jane,
you can fight this.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.908
There is no Mary Jane.

14:16.954 --> 14:19.357
Only the Carnage Queen.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.496
(YELLS)

14:26.000 --> 14:27.265
Aah!

14:29.576 --> 14:32.704
You cannot take away
my weapons.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.240
I am a weapon.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.308
(YELLS)

14:39.672 --> 14:41.079
Where do you think
you're going?

14:41.125 --> 14:42.536
Aah!

14:42.815 --> 14:44.215
Quit hogging the remote!

14:45.018 --> 14:47.201
I... hope this works.

14:47.247 --> 14:49.986
MJ, uh, Carnage Queen?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.880
(SCREAMS)

14:53.113 --> 14:55.162
What is your bidding?

14:55.208 --> 14:57.950
I command you to leave
Mary Jane Watson's body.

14:57.996 --> 14:59.998
(GRUNTING)

15:02.201 --> 15:05.018
(SCREAMING)

15:06.007 --> 15:07.817
Ah! Hey.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.467
You fool.

15:13.525 --> 15:15.669
The pair are bonded for life.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.849
Not even a direct command
could tear them apart.

15:17.895 --> 15:20.665
Bring me Spider-Man.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.481
(YELLING)

15:24.506 --> 15:26.742
No, Mary Jane!
I don't want to hurt you.

15:26.788 --> 15:28.226
(YELLS)
You can't.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.163
(GRUNTS)

15:32.209 --> 15:34.432
(GROWLING)

15:35.101 --> 15:37.191
(STRAINING)

15:37.237 --> 15:39.226
SPIDER-MAN: No!

15:39.272 --> 15:40.605
(GRUNTING WEAKLY)

15:40.740 --> 15:44.147
Crossbones? H... Hydra?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.728
Where... Oh, no.
The SHIELD base.

15:47.774 --> 15:50.176
CROSSBONES:
Hidden under Midtown High.

15:50.222 --> 15:52.233
You think we didn't know
about this place?

15:52.279 --> 15:53.865
And what Fury stored here?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.487
Is this the part where you do
the villain-gloating thing?

15:55.533 --> 15:57.928
(SCOFFS)
Who am I, Doc Ock?

15:57.974 --> 16:01.035
Spilling my plans, giving you
a chance to escape?

16:01.081 --> 16:02.560
Not my style.

16:04.142 --> 16:06.554
(SCREAMS, GRUNTS)

16:06.600 --> 16:09.167
COMPUTER:
<i>Identify, SHIELD student instructor,</i>

16:09.213 --> 16:11.822
<i>Spider-Man. Access granted.</i>

16:11.933 --> 16:14.950
No! No granting!
Computer, shut down!

16:14.996 --> 16:16.836
Give me some credit,
Spider-Man.

16:16.882 --> 16:20.077
As if I wouldn't disable
voice recognition.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.042
Yes. Everything is now live.

16:25.088 --> 16:26.355
Hail Hydra.

16:26.401 --> 16:29.036
SPIDER-MAN: The old Hydra missiles
SHIELD confiscated?

16:29.082 --> 16:30.498
(SCOFFS)
Joke's on you, Morby.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.032
Those were disarmed
decades ago.

16:32.078 --> 16:36.562
Now rearmed,
with Carnage drones.

16:37.387 --> 16:41.388
Our global Carnage campaign
will secure the planet for Hydra.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.437
Ah, there we go. That's the
villain-gloating I was looking for.

16:44.483 --> 16:46.499
We got what we needed
from Spider-Man.

16:46.545 --> 16:48.572
That's your cue, Morbius.

16:49.665 --> 16:53.009
My Queen, destroy Spider-Man.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.302
Aah.

16:54.348 --> 16:57.192
Look, Queenie, you don't like
being told what to do.

16:57.238 --> 16:58.646
I can see that.

16:58.692 --> 17:01.850
Your host, Mary Jane,
she's the same way.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.752
Maybe if you work together...

17:03.798 --> 17:08.953
The Queen obeys for as long
as she wears the crown.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.461
What are you waiting for?

17:10.660 --> 17:13.743
I command you! Attack!

17:13.790 --> 17:15.589
(GROANS, GRUNTS)

17:15.756 --> 17:16.867
Thanks for the hint, MJ.

17:16.914 --> 17:18.637
Huh? Aah!

17:22.530 --> 17:23.607
(GRUNTS)

17:24.550 --> 17:25.471
(GROANS)

17:25.480 --> 17:27.535
No one controls me.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.504
No! This isn't
according to my plan.

17:30.609 --> 17:32.350
If you think you can
reason with this thing,

17:32.437 --> 17:35.075
you're a bigger fool
than Doc Ock ever was.

17:35.197 --> 17:38.156
Hydra, the missiles are
launching. Regroup.

17:43.902 --> 17:46.264
I'm sorry to do this, my creation,

17:46.385 --> 17:48.925
but you give me no choice.

17:49.893 --> 17:51.358
(LAUGHING)

17:51.382 --> 17:53.583
Draining the life from me?

17:53.780 --> 17:58.193
I am not life.
I am Carnage!

17:58.239 --> 17:59.240
What?

17:59.286 --> 18:03.169
(GROANING)
How can you...

18:03.215 --> 18:06.250
(GRUNTING)

18:07.620 --> 18:09.453
(BOTH GRUNT)

18:11.576 --> 18:13.374
Thanks.
That was getting awkward.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.028
(BOTH GRUNT)

18:15.074 --> 18:16.195
Huh?

18:16.241 --> 18:18.497
You also tried
to control me.

18:18.543 --> 18:22.701
A fatal mistake.
(SCREAMS) Whoa!

18:22.747 --> 18:25.165
MJ, fight it.

18:26.527 --> 18:28.345
It's not working, Spidey.

18:28.391 --> 18:30.106
There's only one way out of this.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.670
If I can get
enough power to my repulsor...

18:32.716 --> 18:33.818
That'll destroy her.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.495
There's gotta be another way.

18:35.603 --> 18:37.246
You of anyone should
know that, Harry.

18:37.292 --> 18:38.681
I do.

18:39.914 --> 18:42.733
MJ, it's me, Harry Osborn.

18:42.835 --> 18:44.837
When I was
in the Anti-Venom coma,

18:44.883 --> 18:46.297
you never gave up on me.

18:46.343 --> 18:48.297
Huh?
I'm not giving up on you.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.745
- Come back to us.
- What are you doing?

18:50.791 --> 18:54.641
Are you crazy?  She needs to know
her friends want her back.

18:54.687 --> 18:59.238
Just like I did. We can do for her
what Spider-Man did for me.

18:59.734 --> 19:01.771
Destroy them.

19:01.928 --> 19:04.359
Okay, guess we're doing this.

19:04.405 --> 19:07.220
MJ, it's Flash Thompson.

19:07.266 --> 19:10.738
- I know you remember me
- 'cause everyone remembers me.

19:10.784 --> 19:13.722
(GRUNTS)
I was MVP three years in a row.

19:13.768 --> 19:17.296
(GRUNTING)

19:19.333 --> 19:20.818
MJ.

19:22.992 --> 19:23.892
It's Peter.

19:23.938 --> 19:26.135
I'm one of your best friends,
and I miss you.

19:26.181 --> 19:28.983
(GRUNTING)
I know you're in there. Come back to us.

19:30.966 --> 19:34.087
Guys? Is it really you?

19:34.133 --> 19:37.621
Yes. But we can't stop
Carnage. Only you can.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.927
You helped an entire city
escape pure chaos.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.505
Now you have to destroy
Carnage once and for all.

19:43.551 --> 19:45.675
But I know you well enough to say,

19:46.116 --> 19:48.139
you've got this, Mary Jane.

19:49.340 --> 19:50.771
(YELLING)

19:55.302 --> 19:56.265
(GRUNTS)

19:56.311 --> 19:57.761
Mary Jane!

19:58.344 --> 20:01.537
(GRUNTS)
- MJ! MJ, talk to me!

20:01.710 --> 20:03.392
Oh, please. Say something!

20:07.506 --> 20:11.606
(GROANS)  You guys started
a superhero club without me?

20:12.034 --> 20:13.067
Jerks.
(BEEPING)

20:13.227 --> 20:14.853
Oh, no! I gotta stop the...

20:14.899 --> 20:16.628
(POWERING DOWN)
...missiles?

20:16.839 --> 20:18.089
Flash?

20:18.135 --> 20:20.662
What? I'm a SHIELD agent,
too, remember?

20:20.708 --> 20:22.598
Midtown Marauders rule!

20:23.787 --> 20:25.928
Yeah, I didn't exactly mention
that the advanced

20:25.974 --> 20:28.689
science immersion school
I went to was SHIELD.

20:28.735 --> 20:31.020
You think I didn't know
something was up?

20:31.066 --> 20:33.646
I am studying
to be a reporter.

20:33.854 --> 20:36.048
I never wanted to hide
the truth from you,

20:36.094 --> 20:37.756
but I was worried
if my identity got out,

20:37.802 --> 20:40.263
my enemies would go after
the people closest to me.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.970
- Like you.
- Don't worry about it, tiger.

20:43.016 --> 20:45.951
- I can handle myself.
- And then some.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.984
You're the only way people got
to safety during the Carnage outbreak.

20:49.064 --> 20:50.455
I like to help out.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.088
Looks like that's something
we have in common.

20:56.433 --> 20:59.470
Speaking of which,
there's a city to clean up.

20:59.655 --> 21:01.172
I better get back to it.

21:01.934 --> 21:03.585
It's really great to see you again.

21:04.445 --> 21:05.982
Let's do it more often.

21:13.704 --> 21:15.842
(GRUNTING)

21:16.384 --> 21:17.434
How's MJ?

21:17.480 --> 21:19.278
She's a lot tougher than I realized.

21:19.324 --> 21:20.675
All your friends are.

21:20.721 --> 21:21.803
That's a good thing.

21:21.849 --> 21:23.558
Since just knowing me
is a liability.

21:23.604 --> 21:25.250
You've got it
all wrong, Spidey.

21:25.296 --> 21:28.277
Knowing you, that's part
of what makes us heroes.

21:28.323 --> 21:29.567
So what's next?

21:29.613 --> 21:32.029
Let's go get this city
back together.
