WEBVTT

00:06.880 --> 00:08.416
Previously on Criminal Minds.

00:08.420 --> 00:11.457
Look, we really shouldn't meet like this.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.280
I know.

00:13.290 --> 00:14.871
But, uh, we gotta
talk about some things.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.495
Everyone, this is
our new section chief.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.535
This is Agent Mateo Cruz.

00:17.830 --> 00:19.377
You could have mentioned this.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.666
I got word minutes
after we had breakfast.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.070
Cruz has risen through the ranks.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.411
You ever heard of this Cruz guy?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.740
Uh, yeah, I've heard his name.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.411
Every time
your name was mentioned today

00:29.420 --> 00:32.321
and every time I didn't say,
"Hey, yeah, I know him," I'm lying.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.912
That case could stay open
for a couple years.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.660
It's already been almost three.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.161
Can't we just say we're on assignment?

00:39.170 --> 00:41.377
No one can know.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.615
If I were you,

01:53.620 --> 01:55.747
I would save my strength.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.076
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shh,shh".

02:24.290 --> 02:27.111
U.S. Operations Camp, Afghanistan
OCTOBER 2010

02:31.880 --> 02:32.995
Chief Strauss.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.115
Agent Jareau.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.166
Welcome.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.241
I've been ordered to brief you
on your new assignment.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.071
You'll be splitting time
between here and DC.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.162
So, I haven't been drafted?

02:43.170 --> 02:45.991
Your transfer to State
was a necessary backstop.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.077
This mission is code word classified.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.707
Even the personnel reporting to you

02:50.710 --> 02:52.701
will not know the nature of your work.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.206
You need to change.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.326
You just lost us a valuable asset.

02:57.330 --> 03:00.072
Me? That terrorist got hurt
trying to escape.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.820
You were right.

03:03.830 --> 03:04.990
He talked?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.376
Yeah, well, he started to, and then this.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.996
Agent Jareau, this is Mateo Cruz.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.740
He's heading up the taskforce.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.490
All right, follow me.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.326
Hastings, do you have a minute?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.991
Was this man tortured to death?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.241
This man is Al-Qaeda
operative Savin Mubari.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.912
He was one of Bin Laden's
couriers, and, yes, he was.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.286
Didn't anyone tell you to get changed?

03:35.290 --> 03:38.782
Hastings, why don't you say hello to
SSA Jennifer Jareau from the BAU?

03:38.790 --> 03:40.746
She'll be handling female interrogations.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.956
We don't need a profile
if we know we're looking for Bin Laden.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.871
I'm not a profiler.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.825
I was the Communications Liaison.

03:47.830 --> 03:49.115
Hell, then why is she even here?

03:49.120 --> 03:52.419
Stand down. Jareau is a proven mediator.

03:54.210 --> 03:57.111
Don't get comfortable.
This place changes people.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.577
Can't imagine what it'll do
to someone like you.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.530
Arrogance aside,

04:05.540 --> 04:07.280
Hastings is CIA elite, so...

04:08.170 --> 04:09.489
How can you say that?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.821
He just tortured a man to death.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.661
The Bureau and the CIA
handle things differently but,

04:14.670 --> 04:17.070
Hastings didn't do this.

04:23.710 --> 04:24.870
Who's the woman?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.168
That's Nadia, Mubari's wife.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.206
Does she know anything?

04:30.210 --> 04:31.871
It's up to you to find out.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.029
Agent Jareau,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.167
this is Tivon Askari, our interpreter.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.286
You'll be working closely
with him on this assignment.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.575
Very nice to meet you.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.997
JJ's cell still hasn't shown up.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.786
I'm telling you, Hotch, she's in trouble.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.030
Garcia's tracking her car now.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.201
Agent Sharp, will you take
Agent Jareau's son to my office?

04:48.210 --> 04:49.370
-It's an emergency.
-Yes, sir.

04:49.380 --> 04:50.529
Thank you.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.871
You go ahead, boy.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.070
I found it.
It's on the south side of the street.

04:56.710 --> 04:57.825
They're here.

04:58.710 --> 05:00.996
Uh... Okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.820
Yeah.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.286
I'll let you know.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.536
JJ's car's parked on Constitution.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.916
Morgan and Reid are on their way.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.115
Find Matt Cruz.
He'll know what's going on.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.951
-Section Chief Matt Cruz?
-Mmm-hmm.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.417
Grant, it's Garcia.
I need to speak to Matt Cruz.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.991
Sorry, I couldn't tell you on the phone.
JJ made me promise.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.376
Yeah, I know what time it is. Get him up.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.495
Well, she was afraid
someone was listening,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.115
but what does Cruz have to do
with JJ's disappearance?

05:21.120 --> 05:24.112
They worked together
at the State Department.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.872
Neither one has mentioned that.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.030
They couldn't.
Their assignment was classified.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.328
No, past tense. JJ worked
at the State Department years ago.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.615
I thought that, too,

05:32.620 --> 05:33.951
until Cruz was assigned here

05:33.960 --> 05:35.746
then the secret calls_
and texts started again.

05:35.750 --> 05:39.117
Look, all I know is, is J] said
if anything ever happened to her

05:39.120 --> 05:41.076
that Cruz would know what to do.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.490
Sir, there's a problem.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.118
Chief Cruz isn't answering and GPS
on his mobile isn't transmitting.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.417
That's the same thing as J].

05:48.420 --> 05:50.991
Garcia, have Rossi and Blake
check out Cruz's house

05:51.000 --> 05:53.321
and, Anderson, put Agent Jareau's
family into protective custody.

05:54.210 --> 05:58.453
This is SSA Hotchner with the BAU.
I need to speak to the director.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.206
They're trying to access Integrity!

06:18.580 --> 06:20.457
We can't let them get our codes!

06:22.330 --> 06:24.116
You have forgotten.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.953
I know exactly how to get what I want.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.035
"Why should we look to the past

06:53.040 --> 06:55.076
"in order to prepare for the future?

06:55.080 --> 06:57.492
"Because there is nowhere else to look."

06:57.500 --> 06:58.956
James Burke.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.876
The director's behind closed doors

07:00.880 --> 07:02.165
with the Under Secretary of Arms Control

07:02.170 --> 07:04.320
and International Security Affairs.

07:04.330 --> 07:07.242
Hotch is on his way to the State
Department to get some answers.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.662
We found JJ's cell phone,
but there wasn't any sign of her.

07:09.670 --> 07:11.035
Cruz is missing, too.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.201
His car is still in his garage,
but mail and newspapers

07:13.210 --> 07:15.826
suggest that he's been gone
at least 24 hours.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.114
I'm trying...

07:18.120 --> 07:19.826
I'm trying to pull data off of JJ's phone,

07:19.830 --> 07:21.457
but it's, like, level nine security.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.700
It would make Snowden weep.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.370
What about cell phone records?

07:24.380 --> 07:26.075
Encrypted. JJ's and Cruz.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.536
But if that assignment was a backstop,

07:30.540 --> 07:33.247
then JJ's transfer as D.O.D.
Liaison was her cover.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.820
So what was she really doing that year?

07:34.830 --> 07:36.286
That's the first question
Hotch is gonna ask.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.280
Strauss was pressured
by the executive branch

07:38.290 --> 07:40.110
to push JJ's transfer through in 2010,

07:40.120 --> 07:41.701
so she would have known the reason why.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.870
Any assignment Strauss authorized

07:42.880 --> 07:44.609
would be archived in the SCIF.

07:44.620 --> 07:46.497
That facility is code word classified.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.990
Okay, but Anderson can get you in.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.319
He archives those reports.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.372
Blake, Rossi,
JJ couldn't have used the SCIF

07:52.380 --> 07:53.665
without drawing attention.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.877
She probably has a foxhole
right here in the BAU.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.529
We just need to find it.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.326
And what are you not telling us?

08:01.120 --> 08:05.989
Whoever took Cruz and J]
is highly trained and highly organized.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.377
Justice, Defense, and State?

08:08.380 --> 08:09.608
They wouldn't be on edge like this

08:09.620 --> 08:11.747
if this was a simple matter
of two missing agents.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.662
Is Hotch worried that the recovery
won't be made a priority?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.532
It's our job to find the leverage
that ensures it is.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.825
Let's get it done.

08:19.830 --> 08:20.876
Yeah. Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.321
The sooner you give me the security codes,

08:40.330 --> 08:42.321
the sooner this can end.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.781
Say, "Yes," if you understand.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.457
What the hell is going on?

08:57.460 --> 08:59.075
She went crazy on me.
I don't know where it came from.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.160
NOVEMBER 2010

09:01.250 --> 09:02.877
-Where's her doll

09:02.880 --> 09:04.575
The doll. We need to find the doll.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.706
It's okay. Calm down.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.075
Where is the doll?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.457
It was on the ground outside.

09:28.170 --> 09:29.956
Translate, please.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.871
Me?

09:32.170 --> 09:34.035
That was your first step
at developing rapport.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.450
We need to build on that.

09:51.540 --> 09:52.871
My name is Jennifer.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.165
This is Michael.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.871
Was that your child's?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.530
Where is she?

10:13.620 --> 10:14.780
Quetta.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.030
She's in Pakistan.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.076
Okay, uh, tell her
if she gives us the names

10:19.080 --> 10:20.411
of the men that dealt with her husband,

10:20.420 --> 10:21.910
we'll reunite her with her daughter.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.614
We can't tell her that.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.280
Okay, we can, but we can't actually do it.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.490
Jareau...

10:34.920 --> 10:36.615
You understand we can't launch a mission

10:36.620 --> 10:37.996
to rescue one prisoner's daughter.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.069
Right?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.070
Most of the files are kept on hard copy

10:45.080 --> 10:46.536
to prevent digital espionage.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.449
Secure Compartmentalized
Information Facility -

10:48.460 --> 10:50.246
Okay. Good thing one of us reads
20,000 words per minute.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.706
Time to get my spy face on.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.706
This has to be JJ's foxhole.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.992
It was her office when she was Liaison.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.615
Hotch handles most of the paperwork now,

11:03.620 --> 11:05.076
but before JJ was a profiler,

11:05.080 --> 11:07.378
she reviewed cases in here.

11:07.380 --> 11:08.824
Well, she wouldn't hide anything

11:08.830 --> 11:11.492
too far out of reach.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.241
All right, four digits. Any ideas?

11:19.250 --> 11:22.788
Henry's birthday is November 12.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.287
-Eleven, twelve.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.201
That's too easy.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.450
Try 2008,

11:30.460 --> 11:32.030
the year she became a mom.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.455
Yep.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.246
What's "Integrity"?

11:46.250 --> 11:47.285
I don't know.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.371
But someone does.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.286
US. Department of State
WASHINGTON, DC

11:53.290 --> 11:55.201
Agent Hotchner, we told you
we were handling this.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.700
Yes, Madame Secretary.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.996
I thought it would be a good idea
if we shared information.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.324
Tell us what you know.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.456
Well, it might save time if you told me

12:03.460 --> 12:06.918
the true nature of Agent Jareau's
reassignment in 2010.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.240
She was D.O.D. Liaison

12:09.250 --> 12:10.535
-to the State Department...

12:10.540 --> 12:12.167
...but you already know that.

12:13.790 --> 12:15.246
I know that that was her backstop.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.161
I'm referring to something
called, "Integrity."

12:20.620 --> 12:21.700
Clear the room, please.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.411
"Integrity."

12:34.750 --> 12:36.490
Garcia, cross-reference
keyword "Integrity"

12:36.500 --> 12:38.616
against Middle East operations
dating back to 2010

12:38.620 --> 12:40.110
focusing specifically on military action

12:40.120 --> 12:42.668
taken against Osama
Bin Laden and/or Al-Qaeda.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.911
Now we're talkin'. Whoa!

12:45.920 --> 12:47.035
What did you find?

12:47.040 --> 12:49.281
A ghost file in a ghost folder
on a ghost server

12:49.290 --> 12:50.996
that nobody wants me to know about.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.787
Watch me resurrect some gigabytes.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.781
So Agent Jareau
was on a taskforce to find Bin Laden

12:55.790 --> 12:57.781
and Integrity was the name
of the operation?

12:57.790 --> 12:58.825
No.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.996
Integrity's the name of a database

13:01.000 --> 13:02.206
born out of that mission.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.783
A failsafe put in place to protect
covert agents and operations.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.451
You shouldn't even know it exists.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.996
But Agent Jareau and Agent Cruz know,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.240
and that's why they've been taken.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.206
We believe so.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.992
Both have the necessary codes
to access the system.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.786
Reid.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.491
When was JJ in the Middle East?

13:23.500 --> 13:26.287
And what were Cruz
and Strauss doing there?

13:31.120 --> 13:33.611
But she's already given us the names
of two high-level terrorists.

13:33.880 --> 13:34.949
DECEMBER 2010

13:34.960 --> 13:36.780
Assure her family's safety,
she'll be even more willing to cooperate.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.576
We can't risk U.S. casualties

13:38.580 --> 13:40.457
trying to save a terrorist's daughter.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.825
Well, she was married to one,

13:41.830 --> 13:43.457
but Nadia is a mother first.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.076
Look, she's clutching that doll
as if her life depends on it.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.617
We put her daughter in her arms instead,

13:48.620 --> 13:50.167
she'll tell us everything.

13:50.170 --> 13:52.377
I think Jareau has a valid point.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.075
The child's definitely her Achilles Heel.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.786
What if she's already given us everything?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.576
Two terrorists her husband knew, okay.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.878
But neither provided
tangible leads to OBL.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.029
She could be stalling.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.530
And what if she's not?

14:03.540 --> 14:06.282
What if she has one more name
that gets us BIn Laden?

14:06.290 --> 14:08.110
Well, that's a risk worth taking.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.116
Okay, I'll contact Secretary Jackson.

14:29.330 --> 14:33.118
All right, our fourth person
is Michael Hastings,

14:33.120 --> 14:36.783
CIA operative, killed in action
April 24, 2011.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.417
Operation classified.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.074
This isn't right.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.787
The U.S. doesn't commemorate
clandestine operations.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.166
These are surveillance images.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.614
So who took them?

14:45.620 --> 14:47.576
The same person who killed Hastings.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.746
Let's hope Hotch
can find out who that was.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.325
There are ongoing
back-channel negotiations

14:53.330 --> 14:54.820
we can't disrupt.

14:54.830 --> 14:56.878
So Agents Jareau and Cruz get written off?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.371
I know they're your team,
but they're not your problem.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.246
Who killed Agent Hastings?

15:02.710 --> 15:05.247
He was a senior member
of the taskforce you assembled.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.161
His name is Tivon Askari,

15:18.170 --> 15:20.411
former Iraqi Special Forces.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.538
A turned interrogator, Askari aided
in debriefing informants.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.496
He was our lead translator

15:28.170 --> 15:31.492
until an attack on the taskforce
exposed him as a traitor.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.456
Following the attack, Jareau and Cruz

15:34.460 --> 15:36.109
uncovered among his belongings

15:36.120 --> 15:38.782
surveillance images
and detailed intelligence

15:38.790 --> 15:39.996
on our own people.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.240
Where is he now?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.376
Askari went to ground,

15:42.380 --> 15:43.916
we've been looking for him ever since.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.956
Well, he wouldn't resurface
without a reason.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.281
He knows how valuable _
access to something like Integrity

15:48.290 --> 15:50.747
would be to our enemies,
and if you have no idea where he is

15:50.750 --> 15:52.320
then Agents Cruz and Jareau
are running out of time.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.286
What you need to do, Agent, is stand down.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.576
We are handling this.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.378
This needs to be managed
a little more delicately

15:59.380 --> 16:01.780
than by the coarse hands of the BAU.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.030
What that means,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.412
no more SCIF break-ins.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.376
No more database searches.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.456
Go back to chasing serial killers.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.246
This is a state matter.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.700
Yeah.

16:24.710 --> 16:25.870
They just locked us out.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.996
The State doing anything
to find JJ and Cruz?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.160
No.

16:29.170 --> 16:30.819
So what are we gonna do?

16:31.540 --> 16:33.246
We call in reinforcements.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.070
LONDON, ENGLAND

16:45.000 --> 16:46.376
This is Prentiss.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.416
Hotch, what's wrong?

16:50.330 --> 16:52.457
Debrief me on the plane. I'm on my way.

17:18.830 --> 17:19.990
Soon.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.660
FEBRUARY 2011

17:39.790 --> 17:41.701
Extraction team is on approach.

17:41.710 --> 17:43.496
They should have Nadia's
daughter momentarily.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.819
Helo's on the ground.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.070
Roger, team Three.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.822
We are picking up activity in sector Nine.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.492
Extraction's in place. Go, go, go!

18:03.460 --> 18:05.246
We've got a family.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.320
Two adults, one child.

18:07.330 --> 18:10.288
Can you confirm their identities?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.576
It's the target. We have the girl.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.286
Proceed with extraction.

18:16.210 --> 18:17.780
We're taking fire!

18:17.790 --> 18:19.075
Take cover.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.991
Pull out of there. Pull out of there now!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.035
Pull out!

18:22.880 --> 18:23.949
That was an explosion.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.707
All right, get them back on the line.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.706
Get them back on the line.

18:28.710 --> 18:29.870
Team Three...

18:29.880 --> 18:33.702
Team Three. This is Overwatch Alpha.
Come in. Over.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.610
Team Three, report.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.612
Team Three, this is OvenNatch Alpha.
Report.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.411
According to Interpol's data,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.741
Askari is as bad as they get.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.116
Highly educated member
of the Republican Guard

18:53.120 --> 18:56.419
caught torturing POWs
off the clock for fun.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.160
I'm sending you his profile now.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.667
So this is who has JJ?

19:02.670 --> 19:04.160
His name speaks volumes.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.614
Tivon means "student of nature,"

19:05.620 --> 19:07.030
yet Askari means "soldier."

19:07.040 --> 19:09.110
Askari's methods appear well-documented.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.667
He's organized, he's meticulous.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.116
He typically spends 24 hours
with his subjects before they break.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.372
They've had Cruz at least that long.

19:15.380 --> 19:18.417
It looks like this guy uses
most of the standard torture techniques.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.617
He even keeps his ritual
to an established timeline,

19:21.620 --> 19:24.453
a so-called "perfect methodology"

19:24.460 --> 19:26.667
evolved through years of practice.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.160
No sexual torture.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.536
Maybe he has lines he doesn't cross.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.950
Typically, professional torturers

19:31.960 --> 19:33.916
are driven by a false sense
of moral superiority.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.160
They don't derive sexual pleasure

19:35.170 --> 19:36.706
from the cruelty they inflict.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.029
But Askari isn't just a torturer.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.416
He's a sadistic serial killer.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.115
And they love getting off.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.782
Guys, I may have two more victims

19:50.790 --> 19:52.781
we can attribute to Askari.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.702
Savin Mubari and his wife Nadia.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.826
He was a known confidant of Bin Laden's.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.912
Both were at the camp where JJ worked.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.206
Then JJ would have been assigned
to interrogate Nadia.

20:02.210 --> 20:03.370
Do we know what happened to her?

20:03.380 --> 20:05.416
MO matches all of Askari's victims

20:05.420 --> 20:06.739
except for one thing.

20:06.750 --> 20:07.910
She was raped.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.411
So what was different about her?

20:10.420 --> 20:11.956
Maybe she lasted the longest.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.030
If his ritual dictates
a speCIfic timeline,

20:14.040 --> 20:16.326
any new aspect would fall
later in his routine.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.493
So the longer JJ holds out, the greater
the likelihood that'll happen to her.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.116
So how much time does JJ have?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.951
A few hours.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.990
No, no, no, what are you doing?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.115
It's okay.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.326
You son of a bitch!

20:37.330 --> 20:38.661
It's okay.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.912
You have five seconds
to give me what I want.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.490
-Five...

20:43.500 --> 20:44.615
Four...

20:44.620 --> 20:46.326
You kill him, your plan is ruined!

20:46.330 --> 20:47.957
-Stop counting!
-Three...

20:47.960 --> 20:49.109
-Two. ..
-Please!

20:49.120 --> 20:50.246
-One...
-No.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.285
--No!

20:58.710 --> 21:00.029
Let her down.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.615
You don't have to come.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.160
We know.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.667
This is gonna destroy her.

21:23.670 --> 21:24.989
It isn't your fault.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.536
Like hell.

21:26.540 --> 21:29.282
I was the one who said
we should go get her daughter.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.035
Nadia?

21:36.790 --> 21:37.996
Nadia?

21:54.210 --> 21:55.575
When the war broke out,

21:55.580 --> 21:58.162
it looks like Askari's talents
were recrUIted by the regime

21:58.170 --> 22:00.320
to break potential informants

22:00.330 --> 22:02.207
as well as captured U.S. troops.

22:02.540 --> 22:04.576
So Askari works for the highest bidder.

22:04.580 --> 22:07.378
How does a guy who tortured U.S.
soldiers get drafted to our side?

22:07.380 --> 22:09.996
Wait, I might know that.
I uploaded that ghost file

22:10.000 --> 22:12.036
to my private cloud server.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.070
The order was given by Chief Cruz.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.997
Why would Cruz enlist a man like Askari?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.412
He needed a high-ranking
partner to put him in position.

22:23.420 --> 22:26.571
So what are we saying,
Cruz and Askari were working together?

22:26.880 --> 22:29.781
Then JJ's in more danger than we thought.

22:35.210 --> 22:36.325
MARCH 2011

22:36.330 --> 22:38.241
Hey. Welcome back.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.285
How was your trip home?

22:40.790 --> 22:41.996
What's wrong with you?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.615
Nothing's wrong. I'm pregnant.

22:46.790 --> 22:47.870
Is that a good thing?

22:48.380 --> 22:49.415
Yeah.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.956
Yeah, Will and I have been trying.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.746
It's just...

22:55.460 --> 22:58.497
I never imagined
finding out about it here.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.411
Well, then...

23:00.750 --> 23:02.377
Congratulations.

23:04.580 --> 23:05.615
Jareau.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.911
There's a call for you from the BAU.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.740
Some kind of emergency involving Emily?

23:13.920 --> 23:14.955
Who's Emily?

23:26.170 --> 23:27.535
JJ.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.820
God, you're freezing.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.031
Emily.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.871
How did you find me?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.450
It doesn't matter.

23:38.380 --> 23:40.530
It's taking everything.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.877
I can't...

23:43.880 --> 23:45.074
I think I might break.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.819
You have to break.

23:48.330 --> 23:49.570
Wait, what...

23:50.250 --> 23:52.878
This has to end.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.377
Matt... I thought you...

23:55.380 --> 23:56.824
-I thought you were dead.
-I know.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.991
They're trying to break you.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.951
I... I must be seeing things.

24:06.790 --> 24:08.872
You have to break.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.917
You can't take much more of this.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.415
No...

24:14.120 --> 24:17.032
_ The time has come
to give up your security codes.

24:18.830 --> 24:19.910
No...

24:31.880 --> 24:34.451
Cruz never officially
put his name in for Section Chief.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.575
Well, somebody did.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.572
Or he pulled strings,
called in favors to get closer to JJ.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.320
Emily, you saw JJ during this time.

24:40.330 --> 24:43.618
Did she ever mention Cruz
or details of the investigation?

24:47.750 --> 24:50.617
The first thing I'm doing when we get
to Paris is having this removed.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.746
APRIL 2011

24:51.750 --> 24:53.957
How could a brand hurt
more than getting staked?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.918
Maybe it's a psychosomatic
itch you're scratching?

24:57.750 --> 24:59.741
The brand left an emotional toll,

24:59.750 --> 25:03.117
Doyle established dominance
over you by marking you as his.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.532
The stake... I mean you overcame death.

25:05.540 --> 25:08.202
The ultimate victory over your foe.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.246
Why suffer a pain you're proud of?

25:12.120 --> 25:13.781
Or you could always get another tattoo.

25:13.790 --> 25:14.950
Oh...

25:14.960 --> 25:17.030
Yeah, something transformative, like a...

25:17.790 --> 25:19.246
A phoenix.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.206
Or a blackbird.

25:22.290 --> 25:23.666
I love the song.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.282
But something tells me
I shouldn't tread in your waters.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.450
Come on, JJ.

25:29.830 --> 25:32.037
Something's obviously different about you.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.326
You commandeered an Interpol jet.

25:34.330 --> 25:36.286
You're profiling me.

25:36.920 --> 25:39.115
Why didn't you say
your transfer was a backstop?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.996
Oh, I know that look.

25:44.330 --> 25:47.208
The "I can't trust anyone
but myself" look. I invented it.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.917
Do you ever feel like
you're in way over your head?

25:54.170 --> 25:57.037
I got assigned to an information hunt.

25:57.790 --> 26:02.238
Instead, I am chasing
an UnSub who killed my informant.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.951
What would Hotch tell you to do?

26:05.210 --> 26:08.532
Focus on victimology,
let behavior lead the way.

26:08.540 --> 26:09.666
Exactly.

26:09.670 --> 26:10.876
Who did your UnSub kill?

26:10.880 --> 26:13.030
The one person I was getting through to.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.166
Why?

26:14.170 --> 26:16.286
Because I was getting through to...

26:18.210 --> 26:19.746
I was getting through to her.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.167
What if she was about
to expose her killer?

26:28.500 --> 26:30.240
Someone on the inside?

26:30.250 --> 26:33.742
It sounds like it's time for you
to be the blackbird and flip the script.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.956
JJ suspected a double agent.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.496
She could have been talking about Cruz.

26:42.830 --> 26:44.912
If Cruz is working with Askari,
why take JJ?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.456
His clearance level is higher than hers.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.701
At Interpol our most sensitive information

26:48.710 --> 26:50.996
requires two ranking agents
to gain access.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.070
Maybe the Integrity systems
require the same.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.616
But when agents are compromised,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.611
their security privileges are revoked.

26:56.620 --> 26:58.531
JJ's codes shouldn't work.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.746
If he knew what he was doing,

26:59.750 --> 27:02.071
he could reroute the system updates

27:02.080 --> 27:04.162
_ that would render
their security codes useless.

27:04.170 --> 27:05.569
Where would he have to go to do that?

27:05.580 --> 27:06.786
Straight to the source.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.031
He'd have to hard-line into the servers,

27:09.040 --> 27:10.416
but they're scattered
all over the country.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.208
It would be difficult to transport JJ
and keep to Askari's timeline.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.451
He must have taken her someplace local.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.030
And we need to figure out
which server they've hacked.

27:21.210 --> 27:22.916
It's okay.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.160
It's okay.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.418
_Codes confirmed.
Now we just need the second user.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.320
I guess we don't need you anymore.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.245
Even

27:51.420 --> 27:52.489
Welcome back.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.915
Thank you.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.162
We're getting nowhere
on your inside man theory.

27:57.170 --> 27:58.740
It's_ because we've been
looking in the wrong place.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.450
Where should we be looking?

28:01.040 --> 28:02.075
Ops.

28:04.170 --> 28:06.377
You think the double agent's one of us?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.820
It would be the perfect infiltration plan.

28:10.830 --> 28:12.741
It's the only way the extraction
of Nadia's daughter

28:12.750 --> 28:13.876
would have been compromised.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.995
The mission was need-to-know.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.410
What are you proposing?

28:16.420 --> 28:18.160
I'm not proposing anything.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.456
We've been authorized
to use an off-base location

28:20.460 --> 28:21.745
for enhanced interrogation
of our own people.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.320
I can't believe Strauss
Signed off on this.

28:48.710 --> 28:49.745
She didn't.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.200
Jackson did.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.376
You went over Strauss?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.450
I didn't think you had it in you.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.870
Too many people have died for us.

29:12.670 --> 29:14.206
Hastings!

29:41.420 --> 29:43.069
Fall back!

29:56.710 --> 29:57.916
What have you got, Garcia?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.410
I found the relevant servers.

29:59.420 --> 30:00.535
How many were there?

30:00.540 --> 30:01.666
DC area, six.

30:01.670 --> 30:02.955
We need to narrow it down.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.246
We can ping the servers
to see who's hard-lined in.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.536
But the second we start knocking,
FBI data security is gonna know.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.701
It's not gonna be a big leap
to figure out why we're doing this.

30:09.710 --> 30:10.995
We won't be here when they do.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.490
Okay. I'm going in.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.574
It's not working. None of the servers

30:14.580 --> 30:15.877
are showing any active hard-lines.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.324
Then we're back to square one.

30:17.330 --> 30:19.662
No, no. We don't have time for that.
It's already been 24 hours.

30:19.670 --> 30:22.116
JJ's being held at one of the sites.
We'll work our way down the list.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.610
Okay, sir, I'm sending coordinates now.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.206
What happened?

30:38.710 --> 30:40.575
The convoy was attacked.

30:40.580 --> 30:41.911
Hastings?

30:42.920 --> 30:44.911
Taken, by Askari's men.

30:51.580 --> 30:52.706
There's something else.

30:52.710 --> 30:53.779
Uh...

30:59.380 --> 31:00.415
No.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.376
No... No.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.701
I'm so sorry.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.991
Your code now,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.241
or this time she loses more than her baby.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.376
Go to hell.

31:30.670 --> 31:31.876
Your code!

31:34.880 --> 31:36.609
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

31:37.420 --> 31:38.876
Of course not.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.610
I never told anyone.

31:42.380 --> 31:43.415
Okay.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.324
It's enough.

31:46.710 --> 31:47.950
Come out.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.109
Who are you talking to?

31:49.120 --> 31:51.418
Not to you, to your boss.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.820
Come out and face me, you coward.

32:06.830 --> 32:08.115
Here, try this.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.702
Tea? I'm not drinking tea.
JJ's not drinking tea.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.496
-You need to calm down.
-It's been 24 hours, Kevin.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.411
Do you know what happens
after 24 hours? Because I do.

32:15.580 --> 32:16.786
-What was that?
-Blackbird.

32:16.790 --> 32:17.950
What does that mean?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.279
I have no idea.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.075
It's JJ.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.949
How did you know?

32:29.790 --> 32:32.748
Askari couldn't possibly
know that I was pregnant.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.877
I didn't tell anyone, not even my husband.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.166
I only told Matt,

32:37.170 --> 32:41.243
right before you came and gave me
that message from the BAU.

32:42.330 --> 32:45.288
How long were you listening
before you approached?

32:45.750 --> 32:49.379
The Humvee attack proved
I was right about an inside man.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.069
And look what it cost you.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.957
You can threaten to kill me.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.167
Matt won't give you what you want.

32:56.790 --> 32:57.870
She's right.

33:00.460 --> 33:01.700
Don't I know it.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.537
But I also know you, Matt.

33:14.670 --> 33:17.412
And what line you won't let me cross.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.571
Jareau is your Achilles Heel.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.456
And I don't blame you.

33:23.710 --> 33:27.328
She is an attractive woman.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.662
Don't touch her, you sick son of a bitch!

33:29.670 --> 33:30.989
No more games.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.570
I want Integrity.

33:32.580 --> 33:33.990
She's the price.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.324
No. No.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.706
Maybe...

33:41.080 --> 33:42.616
I can make you one.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.206
Another one.

33:46.330 --> 33:48.878
JJ must have logged in
with a panic sequence

33:48.880 --> 33:49.995
that triggered a silent alarm.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.160
It's pretty standard protocol.

33:51.170 --> 33:52.319
Enter your security codes backwards

33:52.620 --> 33:54.668
and a preset alarm is activated,

33:54.670 --> 33:57.207
in this case, Blackbird.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.822
Oh, God, JJ sent that alert
30 minutes ago.

34:01.830 --> 34:03.115
They must have looped the system.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.872
That's why I couldn't read any hard-lines.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.416
Which of the servers sent the message?

34:06.420 --> 34:07.956
Um...

34:07.960 --> 34:09.029
Hands where we can see them.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.785
What... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

34:11.790 --> 34:13.781
Utherlay oadchurchbray.

34:14.170 --> 34:15.876
Utherlay oadchurchbray.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.781
_ You don't need to be _
a lingUIst to recognize pig Latin.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.997
Luther and Broad Church
is the location of Cramer Industries.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.740
It's a research and development company.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.241
R and D, that's gotta be a front
for clandestine operations.

34:25.250 --> 34:26.285
Hang on.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.326
Take your time, Matt.

34:37.330 --> 34:39.070
I've been thinking about this for years.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.416
Matt, don't.

34:41.420 --> 34:44.207
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.576
I'm fine.

34:47.790 --> 34:50.782
Okay, okay, that's it. Just stop!

34:50.790 --> 34:52.246
I'll do it. Just stop.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.457
Where's the server mainframe?

35:06.460 --> 35:07.916
Subterranean level.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.069
Which way is that?

35:09.080 --> 35:11.321
-Through the warehouse.
-Show us.

35:19.420 --> 35:20.535
We're in.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.110
It worked.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.533
Start with base security protocols
and covert deployments.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.780
Now that we have the access...

35:50.580 --> 35:52.411
I'll call for helo extraction.

35:52.420 --> 35:54.035
Tell the men to meet me upstairs.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.496
You know what to do.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.030
We don't have it all.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.702
We have enough.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.536
-It's Hastings.
-I don't see Askari.

36:10.540 --> 36:12.167
Hastings!

36:22.540 --> 36:25.247
Stop! No!

36:26.290 --> 36:27.951
Thank you, Matt.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.615
Matt...

36:39.960 --> 36:40.995
No...

36:41.500 --> 36:42.660
No.

36:48.830 --> 36:49.910
Emily.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.319
I knew they'd call you.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.162
-I knew it.
-All right. Shh...

37:01.830 --> 37:02.956
Are you okay?

37:02.960 --> 37:04.075
I'm fine. Help Matt, please.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.031
Hastings is headed to the roof.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.200
You have to stop him.

37:11.210 --> 37:12.575
Comms aren't working down here.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.491
He's lost a lot of blood. How's JJ?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.115
She's standing, but that's...

37:16.120 --> 37:17.451
Where the hell did she go?

37:17.460 --> 37:18.825
She went to get Hastings.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.410
It's personal for her.

37:20.420 --> 37:21.660
Go help her. I've got him.

37:21.670 --> 37:22.955
Come on. Come on.

37:34.830 --> 37:36.411
He's headed to the roof!

37:39.080 --> 37:40.160
So is JJ.

39:01.330 --> 39:02.490
I got you!

39:59.920 --> 40:01.160
Can you give us a minute, please?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.876
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:13.420 --> 40:15.206
Matt, what you did...

40:15.790 --> 40:17.166
I had your back.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.029
Always did.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.280
Thank you.

40:25.170 --> 40:26.319
Jennifer...

40:28.040 --> 40:29.075
Get some rest.

40:41.420 --> 40:45.663
Nietzsche said, "When
you look long into an abyss...

40:48.540 --> 40:50.667
"The abyss looks into you."

41:03.290 --> 41:05.030
Emily, how much longer do we have you?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.702
Um, six hours.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.450
It's too soon.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.701
-It's more than we had yesterday.
-Yeah.

41:11.710 --> 41:13.951
I'm just glad I finally got to meet you.

41:14.290 --> 41:16.076
I've heard such amazing things.

41:16.460 --> 41:17.575
All lies.

41:17.580 --> 41:19.662
No. No more lies.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.247
Nothing but the truth from now on.

41:24.250 --> 41:25.490
Oh, yeah?
