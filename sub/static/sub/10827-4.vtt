WEBVTT

00:13.875 --> 00:15.532
-Uh, 5 times 76.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.258
-Stop it, Dad.

00:17.293 --> 00:19.364
-380!

00:19.398 --> 00:21.124
-You feeling confident?

00:21.159 --> 00:22.643
-No, I hate maths.

00:22.677 --> 00:23.609
-No, you don't.

00:23.644 --> 00:25.094
She'll walk these exams.

00:25.128 --> 00:26.267
-Mmm.

00:28.131 --> 00:29.719
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]:
Right, come on.

00:29.753 --> 00:31.617
What's wrong?

00:31.652 --> 00:33.240
-I don't know.

00:33.274 --> 00:35.690
I just can't seem to
focus on anything.

00:35.725 --> 00:40.523
And me head hurts, and
hands are throbbing.

00:40.557 --> 00:42.594
My feet too, and--

00:42.628 --> 00:45.286
-Right, and the gums?

00:45.321 --> 00:46.184
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Mmm.

00:46.218 --> 00:47.323
Right, that's it.

00:47.357 --> 00:47.909
You're not going to
school tomorrow.

00:47.944 --> 00:49.325
-What?

00:49.359 --> 00:50.153
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: I'll
email Mr. Jeffries.

00:50.188 --> 00:51.672
I'll say you're ill.

00:51.706 --> 00:53.777
Look, you're on the brink
of transforming.

00:53.812 --> 00:56.608
How are you going to cope
with a week of exams?

00:56.642 --> 00:57.609
-No way.

00:57.643 --> 00:58.920
I worked far too hard for this.

00:58.955 --> 00:59.680
[sigh]

00:59.714 --> 01:00.543
-I'll be fine.

01:00.577 --> 01:01.544
[explosion]

01:01.578 --> 01:02.717
-Dad!

01:06.376 --> 01:07.274
Dad!

01:07.308 --> 01:11.519
[low growl]

01:11.554 --> 01:12.175
-Dan!

01:12.210 --> 01:13.245
The cloth!

01:16.731 --> 01:18.630
[sizzle]

01:18.664 --> 01:21.495
DAN [OFFSCREEN]: [panting]

01:21.529 --> 01:24.360
-Oh.

01:24.394 --> 01:25.533
Maybe you would be
safer at school.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.228
[music playing]

01:37.407 --> 01:40.307
THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

01:40.341 --> 01:41.239
never speak.

01:41.273 --> 01:44.932
To my grave the secret goes.

01:44.966 --> 01:48.349
The beating heart, the beating
heart of mystic creatures

01:48.384 --> 01:49.557
wandered far.

01:49.592 --> 01:53.527
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:53.561 --> 01:55.874
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

02:02.191 --> 02:03.709
-Look, you're not going anywhere
today without this,

02:03.744 --> 02:07.713
and it's the last bottle in the
house, so don't lose it.

02:07.748 --> 02:08.887
I'll make you another
one up tonight.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.818
-What is it?

02:09.853 --> 02:11.234
-It's Rescue Remedy.

02:11.269 --> 02:12.408
It'll keep you calm.

02:12.442 --> 02:13.823
-Oh, that smells rank.

02:13.857 --> 02:14.548
-Listen--

02:14.582 --> 02:16.274
it works, Maddy.

02:16.308 --> 02:19.449
You're just going to have to
watch yourself for a while.

02:19.484 --> 02:21.624
Just pop a few drops under your
tongue whenever you feel

02:21.658 --> 02:22.763
stressed, OK?

02:35.327 --> 02:36.017
-Hey, Mad.

02:36.052 --> 02:37.467
What happened?

02:37.502 --> 02:37.985
-What?

02:38.019 --> 02:39.400
I'm fine.

02:39.435 --> 02:40.229
-Last night.

02:40.263 --> 02:41.540
You never showed up.

02:41.575 --> 02:42.748
English revision?

02:42.783 --> 02:43.715
-Oh, right.

02:43.749 --> 02:44.854
Um, look--

02:44.888 --> 02:46.925
sorry, things just
got a big hectic.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.342
The English paper isn't
till tomorrow.

02:50.377 --> 02:54.795
We could revise on the lunch
hour, if you like.

02:54.829 --> 02:55.727
-All right, thanks, Mad.

02:55.761 --> 02:56.900
You're the best.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.559
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Oh, what?

03:05.944 --> 03:07.532
-Ugh, what is that?

03:07.566 --> 03:08.395
-It's nothing.

03:08.429 --> 03:09.672
-Smells vile.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.776
Want a tissue?

03:10.811 --> 03:13.054
-Honestly, Shan, it's fine.

03:13.089 --> 03:14.366
-You all set for the
math test, then?

03:20.096 --> 03:20.683
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Okinawe.

03:20.717 --> 03:22.029
-Sir.

03:22.063 --> 03:23.617
-[WHISPERING] How am I supposed
to chill out when

03:23.651 --> 03:25.722
I've got a week of exams, Tom's
on me back, and me whole

03:25.757 --> 03:27.448
body feels like it's
about to explode.

03:27.483 --> 03:28.035
-Maddy!

03:28.069 --> 03:29.899
-[SHARPLY] What?

03:29.933 --> 03:30.658
Yes, sir.

03:30.693 --> 03:31.763
Sorry, sir.

03:31.797 --> 03:32.936
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Waterman.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.904
KARA [OFFSCREEN]:
I'm here, sir.

03:34.938 --> 03:36.975
-[WHISPERING] Hot flashes.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.666
Shooting pains.

03:38.701 --> 03:40.427
Mouth like a Swiss army knife.

03:40.461 --> 03:41.773
[exhales]

03:41.807 --> 03:42.463
-Oh my.

03:42.498 --> 03:44.534
-Shut up.

03:44.569 --> 03:46.053
-Should be fun.

03:46.087 --> 03:47.054
-Ow!

03:47.088 --> 03:48.849
-Keep it down, please,
Rhydian.

03:48.883 --> 03:50.713
Right, you lot.

03:50.747 --> 03:55.580
As you know, this week's exams
will start with maths,

03:55.614 --> 03:58.686
immediately after
the dinner bell.

03:58.721 --> 04:03.829
Tomorrow we will be having
English after first break.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.694
Here's hoping those past
participles will

04:06.729 --> 04:08.386
trip off your pens.

04:08.420 --> 04:09.973
-[WHISPERING] You worry
too much, Thomas.

04:10.008 --> 04:10.940
-Oh, do I?

04:10.974 --> 04:11.803
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: Uh-huh.

04:11.837 --> 04:13.045
There's really no need.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.564
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
General science.

04:14.599 --> 04:16.014
[WHISPERING] I have a plan.

04:16.048 --> 04:19.327
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Oh, cheer up, Liam.

04:19.362 --> 04:21.329
-Six more days and seven
hours of this.

04:21.363 --> 04:22.607
I don't think I can stand it.

04:22.641 --> 04:23.815
-Do you want to know
what helps?

04:23.849 --> 04:24.678
-Yeah, tell us.

04:24.712 --> 04:25.817
I'll do anything.

04:28.751 --> 04:30.304
What we doing?

04:30.339 --> 04:31.995
-You know the best way
to get rid of the

04:32.030 --> 04:33.549
pre-transformation blues?

04:33.583 --> 04:34.722
Move!

04:58.815 --> 05:00.714
-Hey!

05:00.748 --> 05:02.336
You seen Maddy?

05:02.371 --> 05:03.544
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: She took off
with Leek Boy, last I saw.

05:03.579 --> 05:04.511
-With Rhydian?

05:04.545 --> 05:05.477
-What's the bid deal?

05:05.512 --> 05:07.168
-Nothing.

05:07.203 --> 05:08.377
Are you sure?

05:08.411 --> 05:08.963
Rhydian?

05:08.998 --> 05:10.171
-I get it.

05:10.206 --> 05:11.034
Want help from your
little girlfriend

05:11.069 --> 05:12.450
for the English test.

05:12.484 --> 05:13.036
-Whatever, Jimi.

05:13.071 --> 05:14.141
-You know what?

05:14.175 --> 05:15.591
I think revision's
well overrated.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.626
-Yeah?

05:16.661 --> 05:18.352
Well, you don't have dyslexia.

05:18.387 --> 05:24.772
-Maybe you, Thomas, just need
to think outside the box.

05:24.807 --> 05:25.911
Let's talk.

05:36.474 --> 05:38.372
-Hey, Shan.

05:38.407 --> 05:41.686
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Kara, what
are you, like, doing?

05:41.720 --> 05:43.653
-Do you mind if I sit down?

05:46.449 --> 05:48.140
-No.

05:48.175 --> 05:51.454
-This can't be happening.

05:51.489 --> 05:53.111
-Um, actually, Kara, I'm trying

05:53.145 --> 05:54.940
to do a bit of revision.

05:54.975 --> 05:55.562
-Yeah, I--

05:55.596 --> 05:56.804
I know.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.117
I was thinking we could
work together.

06:03.811 --> 06:06.573
[panting]

06:06.607 --> 06:07.505
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: Better?

06:07.539 --> 06:08.678
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Better.

06:10.749 --> 06:13.442
I know I've got a mum and dad
and stuff, which is more than

06:13.476 --> 06:17.549
what you've got, but--

06:17.584 --> 06:18.895
sorry.

06:18.930 --> 06:19.965
-It's fine.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.864
-What I meant was--

06:21.898 --> 06:24.798
it's just really good having
someone my age to, like, share

06:24.832 --> 06:26.144
this stuff with.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.594
-Yeah.

06:27.628 --> 06:28.974
That goes for me, as well.

06:29.009 --> 06:30.873
-Because I've always hated
it, keeping it a

06:30.907 --> 06:32.219
secret from me friends.

06:32.253 --> 06:33.220
-Yeah.

06:33.254 --> 06:34.980
I mean, everyone has secrets.

06:35.015 --> 06:38.639
I bet Tom and Shan don't share
everything with you.

06:38.674 --> 06:42.022
-But they won't have
secrets like mine.

06:42.056 --> 06:44.542
Sometimes I wonder, is
it possible to stay

06:44.576 --> 06:47.579
friends with them?

06:47.614 --> 06:49.547
I mean, how well do they
really know us?

06:53.482 --> 06:55.207
Oh, no.

06:55.242 --> 06:55.829
Tom!

06:55.863 --> 06:56.933
-What?

06:56.968 --> 06:58.072
No, you're supposed
to calm down.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.280
-No, I was supposed to
revise with him.

06:59.315 --> 07:01.282
We've got a maths exam
in 10 minutes.

07:01.317 --> 07:03.837
-Oh, yeah.

07:03.871 --> 07:04.976
I'll catch you up.

07:15.987 --> 07:18.161
-You want to tell us what
all that was about?

07:18.196 --> 07:19.818
-No big deal.

07:19.853 --> 07:21.199
-You sat at the same table.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.270
I mean, come on, Kaz.

07:23.304 --> 07:24.513
Shannon Kelly?

07:24.547 --> 07:25.686
KARA [OFFSCREEN]: So what?

07:29.897 --> 07:31.312
-You two are my BFFs.

07:31.347 --> 07:34.281
That just goes without saying.

07:34.315 --> 07:38.112
But the thing is, I need
Shannon Kelly.

07:41.081 --> 07:42.289
-Why?

07:42.323 --> 07:46.293
-'Cause I think--

07:46.327 --> 07:49.330
KATRINA [OFFSCREEN]: Come on,
Kaz, you can tell us anything.

07:49.365 --> 07:55.267
-I think I might be
good at science.

07:55.302 --> 07:57.822
Come on, aren't you fed up
with being labeled total

07:57.856 --> 07:58.995
air-brains?

07:59.030 --> 08:00.583
I've known for ages now.

08:00.618 --> 08:03.828
In science, I just,
like, get it.

08:03.862 --> 08:05.692
Even before the Nerd
Brigade sometimes.

08:05.726 --> 08:08.867
But I never, ever
put my hand up.

08:08.902 --> 08:10.041
Why shouldn't I put
my hand up?

08:12.561 --> 08:14.735
-Out.

08:14.770 --> 08:18.532
There are certain things
we just don't do, Kara.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.292
If you're so smart, you
should be able to

08:20.327 --> 08:21.880
figure it out for yourself.

08:30.406 --> 08:32.339
-I know where Jeffries keeps
the test papers.

08:32.373 --> 08:33.304
-How?

08:33.340 --> 08:34.928
-He called me in yesterday.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.619
I was just passing, but he
dogged me in for a day late.

08:36.654 --> 08:38.034
Well, I saw him, didn't I?

08:38.068 --> 08:40.174
I saw him pop the test papers
in his bottom drawer.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.072
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: And?

08:41.106 --> 08:42.176
What?

08:42.211 --> 08:43.039
-You still got that
nifty hi-res

08:43.073 --> 08:43.971
camera in your darkroom?

08:44.006 --> 08:45.352
Wouldn't take two minutes.

08:45.386 --> 08:47.906
Nip in, I'll watch the door,
email the piccies to our

08:47.941 --> 08:49.114
phones, and--

08:49.149 --> 08:50.253
-Tom!

08:51.979 --> 08:52.808
I'm really sorry, Tom.

08:52.842 --> 08:53.774
I only just remembered.

08:53.809 --> 08:54.637
-Yeah, it doesn't matter.

08:54.672 --> 08:55.707
-No, it does, it does.

08:55.742 --> 08:57.191
I'll come round yours tonight.

08:57.226 --> 08:58.054
-I don't want your help.

08:58.089 --> 09:00.056
It's fine, yeah?

09:00.091 --> 09:01.989
-Tom!

09:02.024 --> 09:03.335
Well, fine!

09:03.370 --> 09:07.132
[heart beating loudly]

09:07.167 --> 09:08.306
-Maddy!

09:08.340 --> 09:10.584
I do believe you have
a maths exam.

09:20.283 --> 09:22.078
-Nice of you to show
your face, Rhydian.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.779
Now, settle down, every one.

09:32.813 --> 09:38.163
You have exactly one
hour, starting now.

09:38.198 --> 09:40.303
You may open your papers.

09:40.338 --> 09:47.448
[tapping pen frantically]

09:47.483 --> 09:55.664
[heart beating loudly]

09:55.698 --> 09:57.044
[coughs]

09:57.079 --> 09:58.977
[heart beating loudly]

09:59.012 --> 10:02.291
[sound of biting nails]

10:02.325 --> 10:07.641
[heart beating loudly]

10:07.676 --> 10:11.956
[heart rate increasing]

10:11.990 --> 10:22.380
[heart beating wildly]

10:22.414 --> 10:24.313
[scraping]

10:24.347 --> 10:30.491
[breathing heavily]

10:30.526 --> 10:31.976
[fire alarm sounding]

10:32.010 --> 10:32.424
[shouting]

10:32.459 --> 10:33.322
[scream]

10:33.356 --> 10:34.323
-Don't panic.

10:34.357 --> 10:35.807
Stay calm, everybody, please.

10:35.842 --> 10:38.154
[students screaming]

10:38.189 --> 10:38.879
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy.

10:38.914 --> 10:40.674
It's over, OK?

10:40.709 --> 10:42.952
[alarm ringing]

10:42.987 --> 10:44.333
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]:
Just keep calm.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.645
Some deep breaths, yeah?

10:48.717 --> 10:51.892
-Rhydian Morris, you are in
big trouble, young man.

10:51.927 --> 10:58.002
[alarm ringing]

10:58.036 --> 10:59.520
-What'd you go and
do that for?

10:59.555 --> 11:00.694
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Shan--

11:00.729 --> 11:02.282
-You are mental,
Rhydian Morris.

11:02.316 --> 11:04.491
Just because you want to waste
your own time doesn't mean you

11:04.525 --> 11:06.044
get to waste everyone else's.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.287
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: Right,
your attention please.

11:07.321 --> 11:09.185
Go to our form room.

11:09.220 --> 11:10.704
Use this time to revise.

11:10.739 --> 11:13.534
And you are coming with me
to see the head teacher.

11:13.569 --> 11:14.984
-Yes, sir.

11:15.019 --> 11:16.158
Laters, Maddy.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.817
-Why don't you just back off?

11:19.851 --> 11:20.783
-What?

11:20.818 --> 11:22.785
-Jumping to daft conclusions.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.131
-Who are you to talk?

11:24.166 --> 11:26.720
You've been treating
Tom like dirt.

11:26.755 --> 11:28.757
How many more times you gonna
let him down, eh, Maddy?

11:28.791 --> 11:30.862
-Look, I know he's sensitive.

11:30.897 --> 11:33.278
I just got a little bit more to
deal with than babysitting

11:33.313 --> 11:34.417
Tom today, OK?

11:39.906 --> 11:42.563
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Well, you
know where to find us when you

11:42.598 --> 11:43.910
feel like rejoining
the human race.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.365
-This is perfect.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.436
Now you can sneak into Jeffries'
office whilst he's

11:53.471 --> 11:56.508
taken Leek Boy to see
the headmaster.

11:56.543 --> 11:59.891
Tom, the English paper, yeah?

11:59.926 --> 12:01.272
-Yeah.

12:01.306 --> 12:02.411
Why not?

12:06.518 --> 12:07.934
-Hey, Shan.

12:07.968 --> 12:09.970
What you doing after school?

12:10.005 --> 12:10.799
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Now
why would you want

12:10.833 --> 12:14.043
to know that, Kara?

12:14.078 --> 12:16.770
-I thought maybe we could
revise together.

12:16.805 --> 12:17.909
Is that OK?

12:21.982 --> 12:23.328
-You know what?

12:23.363 --> 12:24.571
It is OK.

12:24.605 --> 12:27.367
I thought I'd head over
to the science lab.

12:27.401 --> 12:28.506
-Great.

12:44.349 --> 12:45.799
-Go, go, go.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.214
Remember, bottom drawer.

12:47.249 --> 12:48.112
-I'm sorry, sir.

12:48.146 --> 12:49.009
I just--

12:49.044 --> 12:50.252
I panicked.

12:50.286 --> 12:53.945
All those numbers just
started swirling.

12:53.980 --> 12:55.119
-Swirling?

12:55.153 --> 12:57.811
-Yes, sir.

12:57.846 --> 12:58.812
Swirling.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.469
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: Hm.

13:00.503 --> 13:02.643
Perhaps the head teacher doesn't
need to be involved at

13:02.678 --> 13:03.265
this point.

13:03.299 --> 13:05.612
-No, sir?

13:05.646 --> 13:06.889
-No.

13:26.219 --> 13:27.151
[click]

13:27.185 --> 13:29.084
[voices approaching]

13:29.118 --> 13:31.051
-with your foster parents.

13:38.058 --> 13:42.683
[sniffs slowly]

13:42.718 --> 13:44.202
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Here we are.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.134
OK.

13:45.169 --> 13:46.653
Right.

13:46.687 --> 13:52.038
Just sign this, and we'll see
about getting you assessed.

13:52.072 --> 13:53.591
-Yes, sir.

13:53.625 --> 13:58.423
Do you think you could show
me where they should sign?

13:58.458 --> 13:59.666
This is really confusing.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.288
-Oh.

14:01.323 --> 14:02.220
Yeah, yeah.

14:02.255 --> 14:03.049
No, absolutely.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.084
Well, I could even--

14:04.119 --> 14:07.087
I could mark it.

14:07.122 --> 14:08.433
Doesn't mean you're off
the hook, though.

14:08.468 --> 14:12.092
I'll be putting you in detention
for setting that

14:12.127 --> 14:12.713
alarm off.

14:12.748 --> 14:14.198
-Yes, sir.

14:14.232 --> 14:16.338
-Not a lot slips past me in
this school, Rhydian.

14:16.372 --> 14:19.962
Now do yourself a favor and
concentrate on your education.

14:19.997 --> 14:21.136
-Will do, sir.

14:23.621 --> 14:24.898
-What happened to you?

14:24.933 --> 14:26.037
-Came out of nowhere.

14:26.072 --> 14:28.315
No point in both of
us going down.

14:28.350 --> 14:29.661
Did you do it?

14:37.531 --> 14:41.432
-Um, Mr. Jeffries, could
I have a quick word?

14:44.228 --> 14:47.300
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Wait there, Mr. Morris.

14:47.334 --> 14:50.441
I'd like you up front where
I can see you, Rhydian.

14:53.996 --> 14:57.758
Kay, Kara, Katrina, you'll be
joining Rhydian in detention

14:57.793 --> 14:58.690
this afternoon.

14:58.725 --> 15:00.071
-But why, sir?

15:00.106 --> 15:02.246
-Uh, bullying a younger
pupil should cover it.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.076
Would you like me to
go into detail?

15:05.111 --> 15:06.560
What is it, Kara?

15:06.595 --> 15:09.529
-Sir, I was hoping to revise
in the science block after

15:09.563 --> 15:10.392
school, actually.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.394
[kids laugh]

15:12.428 --> 15:14.603
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
I see.

15:14.637 --> 15:16.156
-It's true, sir.

15:16.191 --> 15:18.607
Shannon said she'd help me.

15:18.641 --> 15:20.126
-Is this true, Shannon.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.991
-Um--

15:23.025 --> 15:24.371
yes.

15:24.406 --> 15:25.269
Actually, I--

15:25.303 --> 15:26.028
I did.

15:26.063 --> 15:28.203
-Well, right.

15:28.237 --> 15:31.102
Well then, well, that's
very admirable.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.725
On both your parts.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.349
You can attend detention
tomorrow then, Kara.

15:42.562 --> 15:45.013
-All right.

15:45.047 --> 15:49.707
Look, um, thanks
for that, yeah?

15:49.741 --> 15:50.984
-No problem.

15:55.092 --> 15:57.508
-Aren't you going to ask
what I was doing?

15:57.542 --> 15:58.474
-No.

15:58.509 --> 16:01.270
None of my business.

16:01.305 --> 16:03.583
I've got nothing against
secrets.

16:03.617 --> 16:05.688
Usual things.

16:05.723 --> 16:07.483
-Cool.

16:07.518 --> 16:09.140
Well, I'll see you
later then, yeah?

16:09.175 --> 16:10.314
-Yeah.

16:15.112 --> 16:16.699
-How bad?

16:16.734 --> 16:18.770
-Nah, a lecture.

16:18.805 --> 16:21.532
Nothing inhumane.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.361
-I'm so sorry about that.

16:23.396 --> 16:24.638
-No worries.

16:24.673 --> 16:26.226
How are you doing now?

16:26.261 --> 16:27.607
-I'm good.

16:27.641 --> 16:30.472
I could do with blowing off
some steam, though.

16:30.506 --> 16:34.338
-I've got detention,
haven't I?

16:34.372 --> 16:37.617
Look, take it easy, yeah?

16:37.651 --> 16:40.551
On your mates, too.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.829
After all, they're only human.

16:53.564 --> 16:54.806
-They forgot to lock
up the chemicals

16:54.841 --> 16:56.153
because of the fire alarm.

16:56.187 --> 16:58.362
Look!

16:58.396 --> 16:59.535
-Uh-huh.

17:02.849 --> 17:04.263
Kara.

17:04.299 --> 17:06.439
-Come on, let's do some
real science.

17:10.201 --> 17:11.720
-I still don't get why you
couldn't have warned me.

17:11.753 --> 17:12.721
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: It's
not a big deal.

17:12.755 --> 17:13.825
You made it out in one piece.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.275
You've got the photos.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.553
Relaxez-vous, Thomas.

17:17.588 --> 17:19.624
Just hand over the camera and
I'll download it at home.

17:19.659 --> 17:21.108
-No way.

17:21.143 --> 17:23.835
You're just going to have
to let me get a minute.

17:23.869 --> 17:24.871
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: What's
he doing in here?

17:24.905 --> 17:25.733
-I let him in.

17:25.768 --> 17:26.665
Have you got a problem?

17:26.700 --> 17:27.632
-Yeah, I've got a problem.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.255
He's not a member of the club.

17:29.289 --> 17:30.221
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Oh, and I mean,
you've never let anybody

17:30.256 --> 17:31.257
in who's not a member before.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.499
-That's not the point.

17:32.534 --> 17:33.500
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: I think
you two ladies

17:33.535 --> 17:34.777
need some alone time.

17:34.812 --> 17:35.847
Don't let me down, Thomas.

17:35.882 --> 17:37.159
Get me that download.

17:40.818 --> 17:42.440
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: OK,
what's going on?

17:42.475 --> 17:43.579
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: It's none of
your business, so just drop

17:43.614 --> 17:44.166
it, yeah?

17:44.201 --> 17:44.718
-Tom!

17:44.753 --> 17:46.099
-No, Mads.

17:46.134 --> 17:47.376
Do I ask you about everything
you get up to?

17:47.411 --> 17:48.757
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Erm,
pretty much, yeah.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.517
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: You don't
tell me, do you?

17:50.552 --> 17:52.105
You've been acting really weird
since Rhydian came, and

17:52.140 --> 17:53.244
you know it.

17:53.279 --> 17:54.452
-What are you talking about?

17:54.487 --> 17:55.315
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: I'm
not stupid, Mads,

17:55.350 --> 17:57.214
and neither is Shannon.

17:57.248 --> 18:00.803
-Fine, I'll leave you to
it, whatever it is.

18:00.838 --> 18:02.115
-Great, see you around.

18:09.743 --> 18:10.848
[digital beep]

18:18.373 --> 18:21.410
-So Kara told Saskia that
she's a size 0?

18:21.445 --> 18:22.342
Not with those calves.

18:22.377 --> 18:23.378
-Give it a rest, Katrina.

18:27.244 --> 18:28.900
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
You're late.

18:28.935 --> 18:29.660
-Hi, Rhydian.

18:29.694 --> 18:30.833
-Hi, Rhydian.

18:38.289 --> 18:40.291
-Could have sworn there were
three of you this morning.

18:43.812 --> 18:46.401
-So if you mix in
the bromide--

18:46.435 --> 18:49.197
-Do you have any idea of what
will happen if we get caught?

18:49.231 --> 18:50.301
-Relax, will you?

18:50.336 --> 18:52.441
I'll do it, then.

18:52.476 --> 18:53.718
-Shan?

18:53.753 --> 18:55.617
-Ooh!

18:55.651 --> 18:57.239
-Oh!

18:57.274 --> 18:58.620
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: I just
wondered if you wanted to get

18:58.654 --> 19:01.001
some hot chocolate at Bernie's
after you're done.

19:01.036 --> 19:03.418
-Voila, chemical reaction.

19:03.452 --> 19:05.937
-Or you could just do
science with Kara.

19:05.972 --> 19:06.904
-Cool, huh?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.906
-This is unreal.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.287
-Sorry, what, Mads?

19:10.321 --> 19:11.288
KARA [OFFSCREEN]: Can
we do that again?

19:11.322 --> 19:12.703
But with, like, an accelerant?

19:12.737 --> 19:14.325
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: We
shouldn't even be doing this.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.568
Just be careful.

19:15.602 --> 19:17.432
-What's wrong with
everyone today?

19:17.466 --> 19:18.536
-What?

19:18.571 --> 19:20.400
You're the one out
of whack, Maddy.

19:20.435 --> 19:21.298
-Ignore her.

19:21.332 --> 19:22.713
Best way.

19:22.747 --> 19:24.784
-Look, I don't know what you
think your new friend is

19:24.818 --> 19:26.751
after, but once she's got it,
she's not going to want to

19:26.786 --> 19:27.683
know you anymore.

19:27.718 --> 19:28.891
-Jealous.

19:28.926 --> 19:30.030
-Yeah.

19:30.065 --> 19:31.860
I am aware of that,
Maddy, thanks.

19:31.894 --> 19:33.517
-What?

19:33.551 --> 19:35.484
-And if you cared about Tom so
much, you'd be helping him,

19:35.519 --> 19:36.865
not one of them.

19:36.899 --> 19:38.625
So don't have a go
at me about it.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.868
-Look, I really don't
like this, actually.

19:39.902 --> 19:42.767
Can you please put the
chemicals down now?

19:42.802 --> 19:44.942
You have been a cow all day--

19:44.976 --> 19:47.634
to Tom, to me, and anyone who's
dumb enough to care

19:47.669 --> 19:48.670
about you.

19:48.704 --> 19:49.740
-You've got no idea
about my day.

19:49.774 --> 19:50.499
None!

19:50.534 --> 19:51.811
I'm out of here!

19:56.333 --> 19:57.472
-See ya.

19:57.506 --> 19:59.232
-Aren't you going to
help me clear up?

20:06.343 --> 20:11.796
[sizzling]

20:11.831 --> 20:15.421
-Ladies and gentlemen,
you are free to go.

20:18.941 --> 20:20.219
-Rhydian.

20:22.669 --> 20:24.602
So who do you think is
prettiest, then?

20:24.637 --> 20:25.741
You can be honest with us.

20:25.776 --> 20:27.536
We don't mind, do we, Kay?

20:27.571 --> 20:29.607
-You don't really want me
to answer that, do you?

20:29.642 --> 20:31.644
-Yeah, 'course I do.

20:31.678 --> 20:33.508
-Kara.

20:33.542 --> 20:35.026
Finish your revision?

20:35.061 --> 20:37.374
-I'm going to ace that science
exam, Rhydian Morris, and I

20:37.408 --> 20:39.824
don't care what anyone
has to say about it.

20:43.552 --> 20:44.657
-Brains and beauty.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.911
-Hey, Shan.

20:57.946 --> 20:59.396
I don't want to leave
it like this.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.811
[sizzling explosion]

21:00.845 --> 21:01.950
Shan!

21:10.510 --> 21:11.856
[alarm sounds]

21:11.891 --> 21:14.721

You're safe now, Shan.

23:06.074 --> 23:09.008
You're safe.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.872
-I don't know who Maddy
is anymore.

23:10.906 --> 23:11.942
-What do you mean?

23:11.976 --> 23:13.599
-I told you what happened.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.532
-You banged your head, Shan.

23:15.566 --> 23:16.636
You were sucking up
all them fumes.

23:29.856 --> 23:31.133
-Hey, wait up.

23:34.516 --> 23:36.587
-I really don't need this, OK?

23:36.622 --> 23:38.106
You don't have to
hang with me.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.626
But do me a favor and lay
off the attitude.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.042
What I do with my life
is my business.

23:43.076 --> 23:43.732
End of.

-Me and Katrina were thinking
maybe we could all study

23:50.532 --> 23:53.673
together tonight.

23:53.708 --> 23:55.157
-You owe me an email.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.263
Just because you're a school
hero, don't think I won't tell

23:57.297 --> 23:58.644
them exactly what you did.

23:58.678 --> 24:00.162
-Tell them what you like.

24:00.197 --> 24:02.613
-Yeah, well, I'll hardly need
to when you actually do well

24:02.648 --> 24:04.097
in an English for once
in your life.

24:04.132 --> 24:06.479
-Well, I deleted the photos,
so I won't do well.

24:06.514 --> 24:07.653
But I'll do my best, yeah?

24:10.794 --> 24:11.277
-Hey.

24:11.311 --> 24:12.209
-Hey, Mads.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.866
-Tom, I just want to say--

24:13.900 --> 24:14.729
-I know.

24:14.763 --> 24:15.592
Don't worry about it.

24:18.905 --> 24:19.975
Oh, what's that?

24:20.010 --> 24:22.081
It smells disgusting.

24:22.115 --> 24:23.841
-Something to get us
through the day.

24:23.876 --> 24:25.912
-So not werewolf potion, then?

24:25.947 --> 24:27.051
-Sorry?

24:27.086 --> 24:29.295
-Shannon's news theory?

24:29.329 --> 24:30.296
Get this.

24:30.330 --> 24:31.573
Apparently you're a werewolf?

24:31.608 --> 24:33.299
Aoooooo!

24:33.333 --> 24:35.197
-Why would she think that?

24:35.232 --> 24:37.510
-She supposedly saw you
turn in the fire.
