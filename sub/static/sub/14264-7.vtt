01:17.080 --> 01:18.582
There's some kind
of disturbance

01:18.583 --> 01:20.084
in the earth's
crust.

01:20.085 --> 01:22.022
it's tearing
the place apart.

01:22.023 --> 01:23.625
leonardo: dudes, look !

01:25.829 --> 01:27.397
what on earth
is going on ?

01:27.398 --> 01:29.535
it looks like
doomsday, dudes !

01:30.771 --> 01:33.608
donatello: and here comes
mr. doom himself !

01:52.374 --> 01:54.977
ah, there's
too many of them.

01:56.147 --> 02:00.854
no. there's just enough
to help me conquer earth

02:00.855 --> 02:03.992
and finally destroy
the ninja turtles.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.861
not if i can
help it, dregg.

02:05.862 --> 02:09.032
you can't help it, reptile !

02:09.033 --> 02:09.869
aah !

02:09.870 --> 02:11.003
whoa !

02:11.005 --> 02:13.307
no one can erase
the green team !

02:13.308 --> 02:16.011
ha ha.
oh, but i will.

02:17.749 --> 02:18.917
gotcha, dude !

02:18.918 --> 02:20.220
wrong !

02:24.761 --> 02:26.697
donatello: the last one
into the alley

02:26.698 --> 02:28.165
is a plastic turtle toy.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.854
now to get rid of you
for good !

02:44.360 --> 02:48.867
at last, i've destroyed
the turtles.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.373
michelangelo:
in your dreams, dude.

02:52.374 --> 02:53.642
but you're--

02:53.643 --> 02:55.278
the real ninja turtles.

02:55.279 --> 02:56.647
you just destroyed

02:56.648 --> 02:58.450
four extremely
lifelike holograms.

02:58.451 --> 03:01.421
we saw you coming
a light year away, dregg.

03:01.422 --> 03:04.260
<i>well, now
i'll destroy you !</i>

03:15.947 --> 03:18.751
you'll regret this,
reptiles.

03:18.752 --> 03:21.356
you'll pay, i swear it !

03:21.357 --> 03:23.792
mung, beam us aboard.

03:26.198 --> 03:28.333
guess we're gonna
have to pay, dudes.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.471
yeah, 50 cents
to see his ugly mug

03:30.472 --> 03:32.507
getting trashed in tomorrow
morning's headlines.

03:34.511 --> 03:37.382
they will pay, mung.

03:37.383 --> 03:41.489
lord dregg, why aggravate
yourself by looking

03:41.490 --> 03:44.227
at our old battle films
of the turtles ?

03:44.228 --> 03:45.762
because, mung,

03:45.763 --> 03:48.234
it is by correcting
our mistakes

03:48.235 --> 03:50.370
that we shall
defeat them.

03:50.371 --> 03:52.741
have you carried
out my orders ?

03:52.742 --> 03:54.577
yes. the microbots
have completed

03:54.578 --> 03:57.482
your new vortex
transporter.

03:57.483 --> 04:00.154
we're ready to commence
the invasion.

04:00.155 --> 04:04.294
good. i've waited
far too long for this day.

04:04.295 --> 04:07.366
in the past, i've failed
to conquer the earth

04:07.367 --> 04:10.971
because i was always in
the enemy's territory.

04:10.972 --> 04:13.242
this time i shall
fight the battle

04:13.243 --> 04:15.312
in my territory.

04:15.313 --> 04:17.315
hook the dreggnaught's
nuclear engines

04:17.315 --> 04:19.052
to the transporter
power supply.

04:19.053 --> 04:21.923
yes, my lord.

04:21.925 --> 04:23.927
dregg: with
a slight adjustment

04:23.928 --> 04:25.562
in the time/space
coordinates,

04:25.563 --> 04:27.132
the vortex transporter

04:27.133 --> 04:28.701
will function
as a space warp.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.203
in a few hours,

04:30.204 --> 04:32.842
the earth will be
orbiting a new sun

04:32.843 --> 04:37.015
in a solar system
i control.

04:37.016 --> 04:38.017
open the warp.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.220
as you command, sire.

04:48.402 --> 04:50.704
donatello: it's
the early warning system !

04:50.705 --> 04:52.942
i'll check the scanner.

05:08.536 --> 05:10.003
there's no one
outside.

05:10.004 --> 05:11.072
ditto in the sewer.

05:11.073 --> 05:12.675
uh, probably
just another

05:12.676 --> 05:16.080
sewer maintenance bozo
looking for rats.

05:16.081 --> 05:18.918
uh, no offense,
sensei.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.423
none taken.

05:21.424 --> 05:23.728
speaking of rats,
i've got a feeling

05:23.729 --> 05:25.430
that dregg
is behind this.

05:25.431 --> 05:26.733
i don't get it.

05:26.734 --> 05:29.135
the scanners show
nothing out there.

05:29.136 --> 05:30.605
but there's
a huge disturbance

05:30.606 --> 05:32.207
in the earth's
magnetic field.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.512
is that like, uh,
a good disturbance

05:34.513 --> 05:36.015
or a bad disturbance ?

05:36.016 --> 05:37.684
bad isn't
the word for it.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.554
if it's
what i think,

05:39.555 --> 05:42.324
it could be
disastrous.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.341
oh, wonderful.

05:52.342 --> 05:54.578
this better not be
another virus.

05:59.622 --> 06:02.792
what is that ?

06:02.793 --> 06:04.862
hey, guys,
check this out.

06:04.863 --> 06:05.864
What is it ?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.667
donatello:
some kind of space warp.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.205
is that what was causing
the magnetic disturbance ?

06:10.206 --> 06:13.277
yes. and according
to my scanners,

06:13.278 --> 06:15.381
on the other side
of the warp

06:15.382 --> 06:17.750
is dimension x.

06:17.751 --> 06:19.053
dregg !
dregg !

06:19.054 --> 06:21.825
the warp is over
a thousand miles across

06:21.826 --> 06:25.698
and growing at a speed
of 3,000 miles an hour.

06:25.699 --> 06:26.999
at that rate,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.003
in a little over
two hours...

06:29.004 --> 06:31.273
it'll be big enough
to swallow the earth.

06:31.274 --> 06:33.578
i think we can
safely assume

06:33.579 --> 06:36.315
that is exactly what
dregg has in mind.

06:36.316 --> 06:37.852
major bummer.

06:37.853 --> 06:39.855
our only hope is
to pinpoint the source

06:39.856 --> 06:41.524
of the warp
and knock it out.

06:41.525 --> 06:42.526
but, dudes,

06:42.527 --> 06:44.964
the warp's 1,000 miles
above the earth.

06:44.965 --> 06:46.867
not even a teenage
mutant bald eagle

06:46.868 --> 06:48.136
could fly that high.

06:48.137 --> 06:50.438
we don't have to.

06:52.343 --> 06:53.879
i can use the portal

06:53.880 --> 06:55.414
to trace
the energy flow.

06:59.254 --> 07:01.324
if i can adjust
the coordinates properly,

07:01.325 --> 07:04.096
we should be able
to lock on to the warp.

07:04.097 --> 07:05.465
that's it, donatello.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.035
i can see the warp !

07:10.240 --> 07:12.242
lord dregg,
someone is trying

07:12.243 --> 07:14.780
to penetrate
the warp opening.

07:14.781 --> 07:17.184
well, see if you can
locate the source.

07:17.185 --> 07:19.088
as you wish.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.027
oh, sire,

07:23.028 --> 07:25.330
it's coming from
the earth.

07:25.331 --> 07:26.833
lock onto the source

07:26.834 --> 07:31.575
and suck whoever it is
into the black hole.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.812
uh, but if we move
the black hole

07:33.813 --> 07:35.815
into place too early,

07:35.816 --> 07:37.317
it could
destabilize the warp.

07:37.318 --> 07:39.822
we may not be able to
pull the earth through

07:39.823 --> 07:41.758
into dimension x
as planned.

07:41.759 --> 07:43.061
i don't want explanations.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.599
i want my orders followed !

07:45.600 --> 07:47.068
do it !

07:47.069 --> 07:50.006
yes, lord dregg.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.842
the black hole
will not only bring

07:51.843 --> 07:53.144
the earth to me.

07:53.145 --> 07:54.947
it will be
a fitting tomb

07:54.948 --> 07:57.619
for those who dare
try to stop me.

08:03.262 --> 08:05.098
the warp
is still growing.

08:05.099 --> 08:06.767
can it be stopped,
donatello ?

08:06.768 --> 08:09.438
oh, sure. but we'll have
to take the portal.

08:09.439 --> 08:11.508
that bogus gizmo ?

08:11.509 --> 08:14.179
i wouldn't feel safe in that
if i was a crash dummy.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.015
listen, according
to my instruments,

08:16.016 --> 08:17.551
the dreggnaught's
transporter

08:17.552 --> 08:18.953
is the source of
the warp.

08:18.954 --> 08:21.258
we should be able to
jump through the portal,

08:21.259 --> 08:23.529
take out the transporter,
and jump back.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.031
is it just me,

08:25.032 --> 08:27.034
or does anyone
else think

08:27.035 --> 08:28.303
that's not gonna
be that easy ?

08:28.304 --> 08:29.805
whoa, what's that ?

08:29.806 --> 08:33.145
it looks like a...
a black hole !

08:33.145 --> 08:35.515
what's it doing
in the portal ?

08:35.517 --> 08:37.619
perhaps dregg
has spotted us.

08:37.620 --> 08:38.654
but how ?

08:38.655 --> 08:40.890
the portal is
a two-way opening.

08:40.892 --> 08:43.428
he must be using
the black hole's gravity

08:43.429 --> 08:45.733
to try to pull us
into dimension x.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.537
donatello,
shut the portal !

08:48.538 --> 08:50.306
it's not responding !

08:50.307 --> 08:52.977
unh ! why am i
not surprised ?

08:52.978 --> 08:55.715
guys, have you seen
what's happening in the sky ?

08:55.716 --> 08:58.520
uh, this is
a bad time, april.

08:59.924 --> 09:04.229
i can't hold on !

09:04.230 --> 09:06.634
donatello !

09:08.404 --> 09:12.611
raphael, michelangelo,
what's happening ?

09:13.914 --> 09:16.283
sensei, grab my hand !

09:22.428 --> 09:25.466
save yourselves.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.635
sensei !

09:35.283 --> 09:39.255
lord dregg,
it's the turtles.

09:39.256 --> 09:42.494
ah, this is even better
than i hoped for.

09:42.495 --> 09:45.433
but there are only
two of them.

09:45.434 --> 09:47.536
well, that's two less
to deal with.

09:47.537 --> 09:50.273
once i get rid
of the other two,

09:50.274 --> 09:52.010
nothing will stand
in my way.

09:52.011 --> 09:55.282
move the black hole
closer to the warp, mung.

09:55.283 --> 09:59.690
but, sire,
it's too dangerous.

09:59.691 --> 10:02.561
question my orders
one more time,

10:02.562 --> 10:05.934
and you'll know
the meaning of dangerous.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.577
michelangelo, let go !

10:11.578 --> 10:13.913
we've gotta try
to help the others.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.118
yeah, but, dude, if
we go through the portal,

10:16.119 --> 10:18.087
we might never be able
to close the warp

10:18.088 --> 10:20.225
and save the earth !

10:21.761 --> 10:24.565
i hope i can get to the lair
before it's too late.

10:37.086 --> 10:38.588
where are we ?

10:38.589 --> 10:40.692
it looks like
some kind of planetoid

10:40.693 --> 10:42.294
within the black hole,

10:42.295 --> 10:44.030
suspended in
a gravitational eddy.

10:44.031 --> 10:45.031
where's Splinter ?

10:45.032 --> 10:47.102
what could have
happened to him ?

10:47.103 --> 10:49.138
with the warping
of space and time,

10:49.139 --> 10:50.675
he could have
landed anywhere,

10:50.676 --> 10:53.279
a mile away
or a million.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.182
or even in
another time.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.019
we've got to try
and find him.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.690
ah !
the gravitational field

10:59.691 --> 11:01.861
is interfering
with my scanner.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.797
let's try that way.

11:08.673 --> 11:10.408
the black hole is moving

11:10.409 --> 11:12.812
within a million miles
of the warp.

11:12.813 --> 11:15.583
oh. just what
i was afraid of.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.854
the warp isn't open
wide enough.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.257
the gravitational
interference

11:19.258 --> 11:21.660
is creating a warp storm.

11:24.566 --> 11:26.001
d-oh !

11:29.375 --> 11:31.443
we've got to stop
the warp storm

11:31.444 --> 11:33.915
before the ship
is torn apart !

11:41.261 --> 11:43.063
hurry, mung !

11:43.064 --> 11:45.366
i've locked
onto the black hole.

11:45.367 --> 11:48.271
activating gravitational
envelope now !

11:52.846 --> 11:56.085
mung: diverting all power
to the envelope.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.621
dregg's ship.
how odd.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.169
the warp storm
is subsiding.

12:17.455 --> 12:19.457
i hope my students
are all right.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.828
perhaps i can help them
in some way.

12:28.641 --> 12:30.409
an invasion force.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.611
hmm.

12:58.990 --> 13:03.665
unh ! we can't...
hang on... much longer.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.201
guys ? whoo !

13:05.202 --> 13:06.671
april ! get back !

13:06.672 --> 13:08.740
grab onto my hand !

13:08.741 --> 13:11.411
it's no good !
you'll get sucked in !

13:11.412 --> 13:13.748
there's nothing we can do
for anyone here, dude !

13:13.749 --> 13:15.384
we've got to surf
through the portal

13:15.385 --> 13:17.722
no matter
how dangerous it is !

13:17.723 --> 13:19.925
if we're not back
in an hour,

13:19.926 --> 13:21.895
cancel our cable tv !

13:24.634 --> 13:27.439
oh, great !
now they're all gone !

13:27.440 --> 13:30.075
guess i'll hold down
the fort...

13:30.076 --> 13:32.680
if i can
just hold on myself.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.899
leonardo ? donatello ?

13:43.900 --> 13:46.503
oh, i don't like the look
of this place.

13:46.504 --> 13:49.274
look on
the bright side, dude.

13:49.275 --> 13:52.414
at least we didn't end up
in some gross monster's belly.

13:54.284 --> 13:56.420
think i spoke
too soon ?

13:56.421 --> 13:57.922
way too soon.

14:07.172 --> 14:09.375
i couldn't even pick
his teeth with these.

14:09.376 --> 14:11.579
tie him up with
your grappler, michelangelo !

14:11.580 --> 14:13.382
it's back
in the lair, dude !

14:13.383 --> 14:15.184
ooh. this
wouldn't be so bad

14:15.185 --> 14:17.389
if i was trying to save
a beautiful princess.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.759
like, what am i,
chopped liver ?

14:20.962 --> 14:22.397
well... no.

14:22.398 --> 14:23.666
but if
we're not careful,

14:23.667 --> 14:24.834
we're gonna be
chopped turtle !

14:34.885 --> 14:35.719
let's boogie !

14:35.720 --> 14:37.489
whoooaa !

14:37.490 --> 14:38.924
dude !

14:38.925 --> 14:41.496
forget about me !
go for the warp !

14:41.497 --> 14:43.298
no way, jose !

14:45.269 --> 14:47.606
hey, black hole breath !

14:47.607 --> 14:50.210
how about a double turtle
whopper with secret sauce ?!

14:51.781 --> 14:53.416
yo, mr. beast !

14:53.417 --> 14:55.385
your mother wears
gravity boots !

14:55.386 --> 14:56.721
oh, great !

14:56.722 --> 14:58.791
why not just
put us on a plate

14:58.792 --> 14:59.992
with a sprig
of parsley ?

15:02.532 --> 15:03.632
now !

15:08.408 --> 15:10.778
i'm getting a life
reading up ahead.

15:10.779 --> 15:11.812
sensei !

15:11.813 --> 15:13.315
well, that's odd.

15:13.316 --> 15:16.287
the scanner indicates
this is the spot,

15:16.288 --> 15:17.489
but there's
nothing here.

15:18.559 --> 15:19.893
donatello !

15:19.894 --> 15:20.828
the ground !

15:28.542 --> 15:29.843
run !

15:36.289 --> 15:38.792
that was close.
whoa !

15:38.793 --> 15:39.893
leonardo !

15:43.801 --> 15:47.139
the warp is fully open,
lord dregg.

15:47.140 --> 15:47.974
very well.

15:47.975 --> 15:50.779
move the black hole
into position.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.681
as you command.

16:20.295 --> 16:23.432
oh, no ! the portal's
starting to close !

16:32.583 --> 16:34.317
this isn't working !

16:37.691 --> 16:41.095
the earth is approaching
the warp, lord dregg.

16:41.096 --> 16:44.100
estimated time of arrival
in dimension x

16:44.101 --> 16:46.739
is less than 30 minutes.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.609
heh heh. you know, mung,

16:48.610 --> 16:50.779
i don't know which
gives me more pleasure--

16:50.780 --> 16:53.618
seeing my new home planet
approaching,

16:53.619 --> 16:55.386
or knowing that
the turtles

16:55.387 --> 16:58.225
won't be seeing
another sunrise on it.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.128
ha ha ha ha ha !

17:02.634 --> 17:04.502
i do not wish to fight,

17:04.502 --> 17:08.375
but cast a stone
into the lake...

17:08.376 --> 17:12.348
and the ripples
will return to you.

17:18.626 --> 17:22.263
i trust i've made my point.

17:32.150 --> 17:34.318
if my inner senses
do not deceive me,

17:34.319 --> 17:36.890
these will be the ship's
computer relays.

17:36.891 --> 17:40.128
ah. the transporter
override controls.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.445
get back before
the monster comes through !

17:53.685 --> 17:55.286
this oughta
chill him out.

17:58.026 --> 18:00.429
i wonder where
we landed this time.

18:00.430 --> 18:03.234
something tells me
it's not the north pole.

18:03.235 --> 18:05.437
and something tells me

18:05.438 --> 18:07.408
that dude's not
santa claus !

18:07.409 --> 18:09.411
move very slowly
toward the portal.

18:09.412 --> 18:11.180
maybe it won't
notice us.

18:14.253 --> 18:16.155
then again,
maybe it will.

18:16.156 --> 18:19.026
ok. i think
that's our cue !

18:19.027 --> 18:20.528
run !
run !

18:20.529 --> 18:22.866
we'll never outrun it !

18:22.867 --> 18:24.302
we don't have to, dude !

18:24.303 --> 18:27.407
the bigger they are,
the harder they fall !

18:27.408 --> 18:29.343
hyah !
hyah !

18:30.480 --> 18:33.050
are you sure
this was a good idea ?

18:33.051 --> 18:35.555
<i>dude, it was
the only idea !</i>

18:37.993 --> 18:41.764
uh ! this rock is like steel.

18:41.765 --> 18:44.068
unh ! if we don't
get free soon,

18:44.069 --> 18:46.005
there won't be any earth
to go home to.

18:51.449 --> 18:55.487
i think
i've just about got it.

18:55.488 --> 18:58.092
oh ! nothing's working !

18:59.862 --> 19:02.232
the earth will
come in contact

19:02.233 --> 19:06.238
with dimension x space...
in 60 seconds.

19:06.239 --> 19:09.912
excellent. as soon as
it's cleared the warp,

19:09.913 --> 19:12.550
transport
the black hole away.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.120
i wouldn't want
my new planet

19:14.121 --> 19:15.621
to get sucked
into oblivion

19:15.622 --> 19:17.491
with those reptiles.

19:17.492 --> 19:20.096
heh heh heh.
yes, my lord.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.943
there's an intruder !

19:29.012 --> 19:29.947
stop him !

19:33.619 --> 19:37.459
you won't slip out of
this trap, you meddling rat !

19:39.462 --> 19:41.700
the fool is in the airlock !

19:41.701 --> 19:44.103
he's space debris now !

19:47.710 --> 19:49.845
get ready to transport
the black hole away

19:49.846 --> 19:51.949
on my command.

19:51.950 --> 19:53.251
eh--what ?

19:53.252 --> 19:56.590
i'm afraid i cannot wait for
your master's command.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.597
dregg: you fool !
you've transported

20:00.598 --> 20:02.534
the black hole
into the ship !

20:02.535 --> 20:04.837
we'll all be destroyed !

20:04.838 --> 20:06.473
it is not the black hole

20:06.474 --> 20:07.775
that will destroy you,
dregg,

20:07.776 --> 20:09.245
but your own evil.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.856
sensei !

20:15.857 --> 20:17.259
you're alive !

20:17.260 --> 20:19.695
as are you,
i am happy to say.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.167
but none of you
will be for long !

20:31.316 --> 20:33.519
the earth is almost
through the warp.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.756
we've only got
a few moments to stop it.

20:35.757 --> 20:39.329
say good-bye to
your transporter, dregg !

20:39.330 --> 20:43.402
you fool ! that won't
stop your puny planet.

20:43.403 --> 20:45.806
all you've done
is prevent us

20:45.807 --> 20:47.008
from withdrawing
the black hole.

20:47.009 --> 20:49.779
now your earth
will be sucked into it !

20:49.780 --> 20:51.482
well, in that case,
we'll just have to

20:51.483 --> 20:54.121
destroy all of
your computers.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.870
ooh ! the warp's closed.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.140
way to go !

21:06.141 --> 21:10.314
hey ! there's only
one problem, though.

21:10.315 --> 21:12.818
with the warp closed
and the transporter gone,

21:12.819 --> 21:15.222
there's no way for us
to get home.

21:15.223 --> 21:18.394
you've got a worse problem
than that, reptiles.

21:18.395 --> 21:20.998
with the navigational
computers gone,

21:20.999 --> 21:23.503
this ship is
adrift in space !

21:23.504 --> 21:26.575
we'll all be sucked
into the black hole !

21:26.576 --> 21:29.078
and when the gravitational
forces disrupt

21:29.079 --> 21:31.115
the dreggnaught's
reactor core...

21:31.116 --> 21:34.421
this tin can's going to
explode like a supernova.

21:34.422 --> 21:37.260
a small price to pay
for saving the earth.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.536
at least i'll have
the satisfaction of knowing

21:43.537 --> 21:45.841
i took you with me.

21:45.842 --> 21:47.944
whoa !
whoa !

21:47.945 --> 21:50.081
i guess
this is good-bye, sensei.

21:50.082 --> 21:52.785
yes, but not for us.

21:55.391 --> 21:56.692
dudes, we made it !

21:56.693 --> 21:59.764
hurry !
back into the portal !

21:59.765 --> 22:00.398
stop !

22:02.969 --> 22:05.240
i didn't think
you'd make it in time !

22:05.241 --> 22:07.844
i've been holding
the portal open for an hour !

22:07.845 --> 22:08.811
close it !

22:13.888 --> 22:16.825
no !

22:20.099 --> 22:22.168
and then,
for no apparent reason,

22:22.169 --> 22:23.704
the space warp closed,

22:23.705 --> 22:26.075
allowing the earth
to remain in its orbit.

22:26.076 --> 22:27.711
the disaster is over.

22:27.712 --> 22:28.713
you ever notice

22:28.714 --> 22:30.082
we never get
the credit we deserve ?

22:30.083 --> 22:32.753
truer words
were never spoken.

22:32.754 --> 22:34.856
hey, guys.
look at this.

22:34.857 --> 22:36.658
i adjusted
the plasma dampers

22:36.659 --> 22:39.030
and attenuated
the time-space helix.

22:39.031 --> 22:39.997
cool !

22:39.998 --> 22:42.769
now, how about one
more time in english ?

22:42.770 --> 22:45.940
i fixed the portal.
check it out.

22:45.941 --> 22:48.278
see ? purring
like a kitten.

22:51.184 --> 22:53.387
hungry as a tiger !

22:59.465 --> 23:02.902
all right ! all right !
i won't turn it on again.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.038
i promise !
