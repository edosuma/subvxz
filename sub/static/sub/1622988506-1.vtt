WEBVTT

00:33.026 --> 00:35.828
<i>So, stick with me here.</i>

00:35.861 --> 00:38.798
<i>I know y'all came to see
a comedy about the Blacks,</i>

00:38.831 --> 00:41.600
<i>everyone's favorite family
with the perfect daughter</i>

00:41.634 --> 00:43.903
<i>that somehow survived
Terror Night.</i>

00:45.871 --> 00:49.008
<i>You didn't sign up to see
some Egyptians open an evil box</i>

00:49.042 --> 00:52.312
<i>and a bat flap his ass
across an Indiana Jones map.</i>

00:52.345 --> 00:56.015
<i>Trust me,
it'll all make sense later.</i>

00:56.049 --> 00:57.750
<i>Well, since we last met,</i>

00:57.783 --> 01:00.187
<i>Dad wrote a bestseller
based on Terror Night.</i>

01:00.220 --> 01:02.189
<i>But then Dad and Cronut
blew that money</i>

01:02.222 --> 01:04.857
<i>faster than a rapper
at a strip club.</i>

01:04.890 --> 01:08.028
<i>We're back in Atlanta.</i>

01:08.061 --> 01:09.829
<i>And Dad's writin' the sequel,</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:12.199
<i>and we were just getting used
to being back home</i>

01:12.232 --> 01:15.701
<i>when this very bat
flew into our lives.</i>

01:15.734 --> 01:17.803
<i>Seriously, pray for us, y'all.</i>

02:05.252 --> 02:07.187
<i>We're back
on the GGN News Network.</i>

02:07.220 --> 02:09.955
<i>I'm your host with the most,
Finding Nemo, aka Nemo Hoser.</i>

02:09.989 --> 02:12.292
<i>Today on my show,
I got a very special guest,</i>

02:12.325 --> 02:16.829
<i>the one and only, the author Carl
Black in the motherfucking house.</i>

02:16.862 --> 02:18.165
<i>Mr. Black,
what's happening?</i>

02:18.198 --> 02:19.932
<i>Snoop!
How are you, man?</i>

02:19.965 --> 02:21.700
<i>I'm good, Carl.
How you doin' today, brother?</i>

02:21.734 --> 02:23.002
<i>I'm excited, man.</i>

02:23.036 --> 02:24.770
<i>I got this new book
coming out.</i>

02:24.803 --> 02:27.140
<i>It's called Terror Night.
Mm. I wrote it.</i>

02:27.174 --> 02:28.141
<i>It's from my heart.</i>

02:28.175 --> 02:29.476
<i>This is my baby.</i>

02:29.509 --> 02:31.344
<i>What makes this book
a great read</i>

02:31.378 --> 02:33.246
<i>for the average nigga
sitting at home doing nothing?</i>

02:33.280 --> 02:37.417
<i>You know, most Black people
know about terror.</i>

02:37.450 --> 02:39.119
<i>Mr. Black, I'm forced
to tell you the truth.</i>

02:39.152 --> 02:41.288
<i>It is an easy read.
Real easy.</i>

02:41.321 --> 02:42.955
<i>What you mean by that?</i>

02:42.988 --> 02:45.425
<i>"There was
a Black man that..."</i>

02:45.458 --> 02:47.194
<i>That's bullshit, Snoop.</i>

02:47.227 --> 02:48.894
<i>Go get my book.
It's called Terror Night.</i>

02:51.064 --> 02:52.765
<i>All right. All right. All right.
That's enough Terror Night.</i>

02:52.798 --> 02:54.334
<i>All right. All right.
All right. Thank you.</i>

02:54.367 --> 02:56.336
<i>Now we got a real guest
coming up on the show.</i>

02:56.369 --> 02:58.438
<i>Make some noise for the
one and only Matt Barnes.</i>

02:58.471 --> 03:00.340
<i>Snoop, what's going on, man?
Thanks for having me.</i>

03:00.373 --> 03:01.774
<i>Matt!</i>

03:01.807 --> 03:03.410
<i>- Who's that?
- Terror Night.</i>

03:03.443 --> 03:05.978
- Ah, this is Carl Black.
- This book is j... Carl Black, man.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.947
<i>You know me.
I wrote Terror Night.</i>

03:07.980 --> 03:09.449
<i>- You read that book?
- The book is crazy.</i>

03:09.482 --> 03:11.051
<i>You're gonna love it,
man. And...</i>

03:11.084 --> 03:12.419
<i>That book was terrible.</i>

03:12.452 --> 03:14.753
<i>One of the worst books
I ever read.</i>

03:14.787 --> 03:16.356
<i>You must be havin' a bad day today.
It's a good book, man.</i>

03:16.389 --> 03:18.091
<i>- Nah. It's just a bad book.
- Hey, you should...</i>

03:18.124 --> 03:20.160
<i>- Fuck you.
- Fuck you and that book.</i>

03:20.193 --> 03:22.329
<i>I'm gonna get the fucking fuck.</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:25.098
<i>That nigga's excited.</i>

03:41.214 --> 03:43.849
<i>Okay.
Just don't. Here.</i>

04:08.575 --> 04:09.476
Hey.

04:10.843 --> 04:11.844
Hey!

04:13.446 --> 04:15.181
Hey!

04:15.215 --> 04:16.449
What are you doin'?

04:16.483 --> 04:18.218
We're practicing
for the Migos' tour.

04:18.251 --> 04:20.053
The streets need us.

04:20.086 --> 04:21.454
The streets
don't need yo ass.

04:21.488 --> 04:24.124
And stop makin'
all that damn noise.

04:24.157 --> 04:25.924
- Frickin' old guys!
- And stop playing!

04:25.958 --> 04:26.992
Again from the top.
Ready?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.230
I'm gonna kick your ass.

04:30.263 --> 04:32.098
Give me the phone!
Cut if off!

04:32.132 --> 04:34.334
- Dad, come on.
- Cut it off! I'm trying to write.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.269
You messed it up again! I bet...

04:38.538 --> 04:39.872
Go.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.541
Daddy, get out!

04:41.574 --> 04:43.343
- Out.
- Hey! Girl, you better stop throwin' shit.

04:43.376 --> 04:45.878
- Go! Shut up!
- I peed in that bed last night.

04:56.955 --> 04:58.924
You know,
I didn't escape the Purge

04:58.957 --> 05:02.062
so somebody would be breakin'
in my fuckin' house!

05:14.674 --> 05:18.578
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Man, come on, bro.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.247
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, bro.

05:21.281 --> 05:24.150
- Goddamn!
- What's wrong with you?

05:24.184 --> 05:26.186
Goddamn.
Why are you so jumpy?

05:26.219 --> 05:28.921
Yeah, 'cause maybe somebody tried to
break in my house and kill me before.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.956
What you doin' creepin' around
my house this late at night?

05:30.989 --> 05:33.293
The lights in the RV went out.
I had to get some flashlights.

05:33.326 --> 05:35.462
- Some flashlights?
- Not just flashlight.

05:35.495 --> 05:37.397
Purge lights!
You feel me?

05:37.430 --> 05:39.399
You know about these.
Did I tell you about 'em?

05:39.432 --> 05:41.468
You don't need no battery.
That means you crank it right up.

05:41.501 --> 05:43.103
- Just like this.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, man.

05:43.136 --> 05:44.404
- What? What?
- Hey, hey.

05:44.437 --> 05:47.005
Get rid of that janky shit!
Stop orderin' it.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.109
Y'all run around here ballin'
and spendin' money,

05:49.142 --> 05:51.511
leavin' the lights on,
runnin' water,

05:51.544 --> 05:53.979
like there's money
growin' on the tree.

05:54.012 --> 05:56.282
- I don't have no more money.
- 'Cause you ain't selling no goddamn books.

05:56.316 --> 05:59.252
If you sell some goddamn books,
we can goddamn sell these bitches.

05:59.285 --> 06:02.422
- And why're you broke? Huh?
- Get your ass out of here.

06:02.455 --> 06:03.556
Hey, man.
What the fuck, man?

06:03.590 --> 06:06.326
Stop holding me
like a side bitch.

06:06.359 --> 06:08.428
- What's you tripping off of?
- This is the reason right here.

06:08.461 --> 06:12.198
'Cause I can't imagine
why I let you talk me

06:12.232 --> 06:14.234
into spending
my money on this shit.

06:14.267 --> 06:15.934
It's all part
of the business plan, cuz.

06:15.968 --> 06:17.570
No, no, no.
The business plan

06:17.604 --> 06:19.239
is the reason why
Lorena is out

06:19.272 --> 06:22.175
busting her ass
to wipe my old ass.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.576
Don't nobody want
to hear about me

06:23.610 --> 06:25.612
moving back
into my old neighborhood

06:25.645 --> 06:28.013
while my cousin livin' in an RV
in the back of my house.

06:30.116 --> 06:32.218
What the fuck
is going on over there, man?

06:32.252 --> 06:34.087
Some crackheads.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.522
Next door at the old
Marsten house.

06:35.555 --> 06:37.657
They must be squattin'
or somethin'.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.192
<i>- Don't forget the...
- Nah. They live there.</i>

06:39.225 --> 06:41.428
I seen 'em move in,
but the crazy part is

06:41.461 --> 06:43.663
all the windows are boarded.

06:43.696 --> 06:46.199
They only come out
at nighttime.

06:46.232 --> 06:48.201
Yeah. Who would move
in a place

06:48.234 --> 06:50.203
with a house that's boarded up like that?

06:50.236 --> 06:51.571
And when did they move in?

06:51.604 --> 06:53.206
Yeah. They got in
like a week ago.

06:53.239 --> 06:54.674
<i>- What the fuck?
- Snitch, Snitch,</i>

06:54.707 --> 06:56.509
<i>- where you at?
- Yeah. I watched 'em do it.</i>

06:56.543 --> 06:58.578
They moved in, man.

06:58.611 --> 07:00.647
I see everything.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.383
I know you with the neighborhood
watch and everything, but man...

07:03.416 --> 07:05.452
it's getting
a little creepy, man.

07:05.485 --> 07:07.620
All right, ladies, in we go. Your coupe is here.

07:07.654 --> 07:09.522
- Did you hear that?
- Shhh...

07:09.556 --> 07:11.157
That's some crazy shit.

07:18.598 --> 07:22.202
Somethin' strange
goin' on in that house.

07:29.609 --> 07:30.743
I'm gone.

07:41.054 --> 07:44.257
<i>You will be mine...</i>

07:44.290 --> 07:46.359
<i>unconditionally.</i>

07:55.768 --> 07:58.404
Baby, I think some new people
just moved in next door.

07:58.438 --> 08:01.374
Oh, baby. Leave
those people alone, babe.

08:01.407 --> 08:03.576
Go back to sleep.

08:21.327 --> 08:23.196
This refrigerator's filthy!

08:25.164 --> 08:27.233
- Appreciate shit.
- Ahem.

08:28.368 --> 08:29.836
What are you doing
here, Cronut?

08:29.869 --> 08:31.471
I had to get some milk
for my cereal.

08:31.504 --> 08:33.706
I ran out in the RV.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.642
The door's locked
for a reason.

08:35.675 --> 08:37.210
Who messed up that damn toilet?

08:37.243 --> 08:39.145
Hey, what the fuck
you doin' in here?

08:39.178 --> 08:40.813
Eating breakfast.
What it look like I'm doin'?

08:40.847 --> 08:42.382
You ain't supposed
to be here in the mornings.

08:42.415 --> 08:43.716
You told me I could
come in on Tuesdays.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.084
I'm about sick of your shit.

08:45.118 --> 08:47.120
It's light wheat.

08:47.153 --> 08:48.821
Stay out of the toilet.

08:48.855 --> 08:50.757
You know there's a serial
killer living next door.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.126
God, this boy run
his damn mouth too much.

08:53.159 --> 08:56.229
Hey, Carl, Carl.
Check this shit out, bro.

08:56.262 --> 08:58.164
<i>...the death of Chante Webster.</i>

08:58.197 --> 09:01.501
<i>Her badly mutilated corpse
was found inside a dumpster</i>

09:01.534 --> 09:05.638
<i>behind Gus's Chicken and
Waffles on Indian Hill Road.</i>

09:05.672 --> 09:07.340
They found that body
right around the corner.

09:07.373 --> 09:09.108
<i>This is the sixth incident</i>

09:09.142 --> 09:12.178
<i>in a vicious string
of kidnapping and murders,</i>

09:12.211 --> 09:16.616
<i>all of which were either
African-American or Mexican.</i>

09:16.649 --> 09:19.352
<i>Racially motivated?
Perhaps.</i>

09:19.385 --> 09:22.255
This is exactly why we need to
move out of this neighborhood.

09:22.288 --> 09:24.257
- Move? Again?
- Yes, move.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.159
And when we say "move,"

09:26.192 --> 09:28.528
- that means us.
- Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

09:28.561 --> 09:30.363
Uh, hey... hey.
No thinkin' for you, okay?

09:30.396 --> 09:31.764
What about what we saw
last night?

09:31.798 --> 09:33.800
Okay, I don't have time
for this, Carl.

09:33.833 --> 09:36.235
I got to go to work.
I'm going to be working a double tonight,

09:36.269 --> 09:37.670
so you're on your own
for dinner.

09:37.704 --> 09:40.573
What about what we seen
with the neighbors, bro?

09:42.709 --> 09:44.143
You better do what she say.

09:44.177 --> 09:45.278
Fuck you up.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.779
She payin' the bills
around here.

09:46.813 --> 09:49.716
Hey, babe. Don't pay
no attention to Cronut.

09:49.749 --> 09:51.417
He's just a dumbass.

09:51.451 --> 09:53.453
He's a neglected Chihuahua.

09:53.486 --> 09:55.188
Carl, I'm not happy here.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.423
- Listen...
- This was supposed to be temporary, Carl.

09:57.457 --> 09:59.425
We were supposed
to be here until you got

09:59.459 --> 10:00.760
- your money going.
- Money.

10:00.793 --> 10:03.496
- You wrote your book.
- It's gonna work.

10:03.529 --> 10:05.832
That developer came
around again other day.

10:05.865 --> 10:09.235
He can make us a really good
offer on your mom's house.

10:09.268 --> 10:11.270
We can move
to a safer place.

10:11.304 --> 10:14.374
I can be happy.
Happy wife, happy what?

10:14.407 --> 10:16.542
- Happy wife.
- Happy life.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.678
The guy's a fuckin'
vulture. Okay?

10:18.711 --> 10:20.480
He wants to move
in this neighborhood

10:20.513 --> 10:23.249
so he can take it over and turn
it into a fuckin' strip mall.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.418
Do you understand
what I'm sayin'? Okay?

10:25.451 --> 10:27.220
It's called...
it's called gingivitis.

10:27.253 --> 10:28.621
Gentrification!

10:28.655 --> 10:29.656
Shut up, Cronut!

10:29.689 --> 10:31.791
Stupid dumbass nigga.

10:31.824 --> 10:33.893
Once we move out of here, who cares
what they do to the neighborhood?

10:33.926 --> 10:36.896
Just promise me that today you're
going to look at this and consider it.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.698
I'm... I'm gonna
think about it.

10:38.731 --> 10:40.600
I appreciate it.

10:40.633 --> 10:44.203
<i>Up next, I survived
a hammer to the head</i>

10:44.237 --> 10:46.706
<i>and a boot to the face.</i>

10:46.739 --> 10:48.841
Somethin' fucked-up went
down in that house last night.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.243
You think that was
a dead body?

10:50.276 --> 10:52.311
Would you stop?
It's already hard enough

10:52.345 --> 10:54.781
you got all this crazy
shit in my wife's head.

10:54.814 --> 10:57.917
And no!
I did not see a body.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.653
I think my first instinct is
like, there's dead body in there.

11:00.687 --> 11:03.356
But... Oh, there's a nice
one over there.

11:16.636 --> 11:17.637
No.

11:21.708 --> 11:23.476
Hey, hey, hey! No!

11:23.509 --> 11:25.344
Why you cock-blocking?
She need me.

11:25.378 --> 11:27.246
This could be
my old lady, man.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.716
- She's already married.
- You know I've been in the penitentiary.

11:29.749 --> 11:31.384
- Let me just live, brother.
- Okay.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.786
You've been to prison
two years ago for 10 days

11:33.820 --> 11:35.388
for drinkin' and drivin'.

11:35.421 --> 11:37.423
And you're
a "gangster drinker."

11:37.457 --> 11:39.559
I'm just gonna go over there and just...
just rap a tad to her.

11:39.592 --> 11:40.993
- I'm gonna go. What's up, baby?

11:42.862 --> 11:45.932
He about to shoot that
midget sperm in that girl.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.834
Bunny! Shit.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.936
Baby, I told you,
you got to get a new wheelchair.

11:49.969 --> 11:51.571
- You got new wheelchair money?
- Ugh!

11:53.005 --> 11:54.640
- I'm sorry, Bunny.
- It's okay.

11:54.674 --> 11:56.275
I didn't mean
to snap at you.

11:56.309 --> 11:57.777
If my penis worked,
I'd make love to you right now.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.612
- I'd hit it from the back.
- I know you would.

11:59.645 --> 12:01.848

You gonna help me

12:43.756 --> 12:45.792

12:45.825 --> 12:48.394
Tend more than the garden.
I will bend you over in there. I mean...

12:48.427 --> 12:49.629
So, I have carrots.

12:49.662 --> 12:51.697

With a fat head.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.066
What's up with that house

12:55.401 --> 12:58.105

13:02.008 --> 13:03.876
- How you think I got Bunny?
- The government.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.912
That little check you get every
month, she's takin' it.

13:15.822 --> 13:17.590
I wish you...
I've been waiting on this.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.392
Why would you kick me in the leg

13:19.425 --> 13:21.828

Come on. You ain't the first
Black guy I got in a fight with.

13:24.031 --> 13:26.133

Hit me in the face.

You little bitch.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.603
All day, every day.

13:30.636 --> 13:33.539
Listen, man. Somethin' ain't
right at that house, Carl.

13:33.573 --> 13:34.907
They moved
in the middle of night.

13:34.941 --> 13:37.144
There's never any movement
during the day.

13:37.177 --> 13:39.146
- Yeah.
- Lazy shits won't answer the door,

13:39.179 --> 13:40.446

13:50.723 --> 13:52.458
- I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
- You might get on...

13:52.491 --> 13:53.926

- Okay. Let my arm go.

13:55.761 --> 13:57.030

Nigga, we saw you transporting
dead bodies last night.

15:06.732 --> 15:08.834
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man.
Shut the fuck up.

15:08.868 --> 15:10.170
We did.

15:10.203 --> 15:12.805
You not see me
transport any dead bodies.

15:12.838 --> 15:15.608
We standin' in front of a
chocolate vampire-type nigga.

15:15.641 --> 15:19.011
Sir, and this my little cousin,
Cronut, he's a little retarded.

15:19.046 --> 15:21.148

- He's on Ritalin, prednisone, and all kind of shit.
- Everything.

15:23.950 --> 15:26.519
This is Dr. Mamuwalde's
residence.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.654

15:50.543 --> 15:52.179
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.613
Nigga, we saw you transport them
goddamn dead bodies in the back.

15:54.647 --> 15:56.983
- If you don't shut the fuck...

15:57.016 --> 15:59.618
- Hey, man, stop! Sir...

16:01.954 --> 16:04.623
No. I don't have no business here.
We just wanted to come through and say hey

16:04.657 --> 16:06.226

Why wouldn't it be cool?

16:09.162 --> 16:11.064

- Fall back for what?

16:36.655 --> 16:37.757

16:37.790 --> 16:39.159
You don't think

Nigga! Ain't nobody
reading your books! Retire!

16:52.072 --> 16:54.074

16:57.177 --> 16:58.611

16:58.644 --> 17:00.280
First of all,
I'm not smoking K2.

17:00.313 --> 17:02.049
I'm smoking strictly weed.

17:02.082 --> 17:04.016
And second of all,
something ain't right about that house,

17:04.051 --> 17:07.820

Yes, Daddy? Yes?

18:38.078 --> 18:39.845
- What you doing?
- I'm studying.

18:39.879 --> 18:41.148
- You're studying.
- Yes.

18:41.181 --> 18:42.781
Yeah. I thought you
was home for fall?

18:42.815 --> 18:44.783
Doesn't mean I still
don't have to study, Dad.

18:44.817 --> 18:47.786
You know our family have been
going through a lot of stuff,

18:47.820 --> 18:50.457
and you don't like to follow
the rules all the time,

18:50.490 --> 18:52.825
'cause I've been asked you
a whole bunch of times

18:52.858 --> 18:54.793
to keep these little boys
out of my...

18:54.827 --> 18:56.762
- Daddy, I can explain...
- Ah! What the hell is wrong with you?

18:59.366 --> 19:01.767
No, bitch.
Dying's for pussies.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.237
I told you to keep these
little boys out of this house.

19:04.271 --> 19:06.373
I sent you to school
for a education...

19:06.406 --> 19:08.475
- I had to drop out, okay?
- You dropped out?

19:08.508 --> 19:10.876
We dropped out.
A couple goes...

19:10.910 --> 19:13.413
You and him about to be living off
that little cripple check every month.

19:13.446 --> 19:15.415
- Baby, give me my cane. I'm out.
- Okay.

19:15.448 --> 19:17.250
Yeah, this

19:17.284 --> 19:18.951
I don't know what

19:18.984 --> 19:21.188
Daddy, Daddy. Just...
just leave him alone, okay?

19:21.221 --> 19:22.888
If you're gonna do
somethin', do somethin'.

19:22.922 --> 19:24.124
It's already done.

19:24.157 --> 19:25.891
If you're gonna do
somethin', do somethin'.

19:25.925 --> 19:27.294
Freezee!

19:27.327 --> 19:28.761
Daddy,
why'd you do that?

19:28.794 --> 19:29.895
I didn't even touch him.

19:29.929 --> 19:31.198
That's all right.
You got it, baby?

19:31.231 --> 19:32.465
Come on. Help his arm.
Get his arm right there.

19:32.499 --> 19:34.434
Hey, I don't need your help!
I'm in the ADA.

19:34.467 --> 19:35.968
Baby, you do need help.

19:36.001 --> 19:37.404
- All right.
- You need some help, okay?

19:38.871 --> 19:39.939
Yeah. Lift him up.
One, two, three.

19:41.374 --> 19:43.310
Fuck you! Ain't nobody
need your assistance.

19:43.343 --> 19:45.111
Baby, go start
the car, okay?

19:45.145 --> 19:47.047
- All right.
- We'll be out of here in a second.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.515
I'm gonna let you know one thing.
My dick may not work,

19:48.548 --> 19:51.451
but my tongue game's
strong on your girl.

19:51.484 --> 19:53.086
Okay. Baby, go.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.354
Ask him for some
gas money, baby.

19:54.387 --> 19:56.822
I will. I'll ask him
for some. Okay.

19:56.855 --> 19:58.325
Oh, thank God.

19:58.358 --> 20:00.293
But why don't you get
somebody that can walk?

20:00.327 --> 20:01.827
I ain't helping.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.796
Daddy, listen.
Okay, I had to drop out

20:03.829 --> 20:05.864
because your check bounced.

20:05.898 --> 20:07.933
And you would know that if you
cared about anybody in this family

20:07.967 --> 20:09.969
except yourself
and that damn book.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.439
He loves me.

20:14.873 --> 20:16.842
He only cares about himself.
He's so selfish.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.411
Allie!

20:22.215 --> 20:23.483
Allie!

20:23.516 --> 20:25.051
Allie!

20:29.522 --> 20:32.392
Ekekek. Ekekek.

20:32.425 --> 20:34.127
Psst! Ekekek.

20:35.995 --> 20:38.198
Carl, come here.

20:38.231 --> 20:39.399
You gotta see this shit.

20:39.432 --> 20:41.034
Get over where?
How do I get over there?

20:41.067 --> 20:42.269
Hop over, man.

20:44.404 --> 20:47.040
No, no, for real.
For real. Come here.

20:47.073 --> 20:49.276
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Calm down. Calm down.

20:49.309 --> 20:51.444
Check that. Shit!

20:55.881 --> 20:57.350
Is that Michael Jackson?

20:57.384 --> 20:59.252
<i>Where's the box from Africa?</i>

20:59.286 --> 21:00.819
- That's so weird.
- Hey! Hey, man!

21:00.853 --> 21:02.355
Hey, man,
don't do that!

21:02.389 --> 21:04.391
Why are you always
creeping up on people, man?

21:04.424 --> 21:07.027
- Don't do that.
- That's what I do. I creep.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.462
<i>- Look, look.
- Find it.</i>

21:10.697 --> 21:13.500
They just moved into the house
and people are already coming over.

21:16.569 --> 21:19.139
Goddamn. She got
a big 'ol ass.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.842
Hello. I'm here
for Dr. Mamuwalde.

21:32.619 --> 21:34.254
Something ain't right.

21:34.287 --> 21:35.488
I'mma tell you
something.

21:35.522 --> 21:38.558
Leave them goddamn
neighbors alone.

21:38.591 --> 21:42.095
- Leave them alone! I'm out of here.
- Look.

21:42.128 --> 21:43.296
I think you
made him mad.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.365
He's always mad at me.
Don't even trip.

21:45.398 --> 21:47.467
She ain't coming back out of there.
I told you, once you go in there,

21:47.500 --> 21:49.569
you ain't coming out,
especially if you're fine.

21:49.602 --> 21:52.339
All the ugly bitches came right
out, but this coochie?

21:52.372 --> 21:54.607
I'm going in.

21:54.641 --> 21:56.309
I'm neighborhood watch.

22:00.613 --> 22:02.282
Yeah. You go
right on in there.

22:02.315 --> 22:04.484
I trust you.

22:04.517 --> 22:06.186
<i>Snitch, Snitch, come in.</i>

22:09.988 --> 22:11.358
What can I do for you?

22:11.391 --> 22:13.660
I'm neighborhood watch.
I need to get in this house.

22:13.693 --> 22:17.230
Well then, please, come in,
Mr. Neighborhood Watch.

22:17.263 --> 22:18.997
You're very welcome here.

22:25.638 --> 22:28.174
Cronut, what the fuck
are you doing?

22:28.208 --> 22:29.175
Shhh!

22:32.178 --> 22:34.514
Why are you looking
in their window?

22:34.547 --> 22:36.049
Get out of them
people's house.

22:37.950 --> 22:39.486
What you see?

22:39.519 --> 22:41.154
Well, first of all,
this house looks amazing on the inside,

22:41.187 --> 22:44.290
but they're doing
some freaky shit for real.

22:44.324 --> 22:48.161
What? What's he doing?

22:51.331 --> 22:54.933
Cronut! What's going on?

22:54.967 --> 22:57.437
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- What? What? What?

22:57.470 --> 23:00.073
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- What? What?

23:00.106 --> 23:01.541
Go, go.

23:03.976 --> 23:07.280
- Oh, shit.
- Why we running, man?

23:07.313 --> 23:10.183
<i>- Hey, ¿qué pasó?
- OG. Hugo.</i>

23:10.216 --> 23:12.085
There's vampires, man.
There's vampires.

23:12.118 --> 23:13.386
Re... relax. Ain't no...

23:13.420 --> 23:16.356
The vampire feeds on blood.

23:16.389 --> 23:20.193
But what he really wants

23:20.226 --> 23:22.695
is to find the things
that you love most

23:22.729 --> 23:24.930
and twist you...

23:26.266 --> 23:29.935
and torment you
every day of your life.

23:32.105 --> 23:34.107
You're a dark motherfucker.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.676
You've been saying some crazy
shit back here in this backyard.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.478
So what should we do, OG?

23:38.511 --> 23:40.447
Find out what he wants.

23:42.382 --> 23:45.685
Find out what he's doing
in our neighborhood.

23:45.718 --> 23:47.253
Think about it.

23:47.287 --> 23:49.122
We ain't never seen
Dr. Mamuwalde in the daytime.

23:49.155 --> 23:50.657
- You know why?
- Why?

23:50.690 --> 23:52.592
"And they rise from
the grave at night

23:52.625 --> 23:54.727
- to feast on the living."
- Oh, no.

23:54.761 --> 23:57.430
Shut the fuck up
for a second.

23:57.464 --> 23:59.299
Just for one second,
shut the fuck up.

23:59.332 --> 24:02.135
You know what? All that
coming to... to life

24:02.168 --> 24:05.505
<i>and the dead rising up
and the Tales of the Crypt</i>

24:05.538 --> 24:07.740
and the Michael Jackson,
the monsters,

24:07.774 --> 24:10.210
all that is a bunch of bullshit!

24:10.243 --> 24:12.178
Did you see the little
guy in the window?

24:12.212 --> 24:13.613
'Cause you probably
think it's Prince

24:13.646 --> 24:15.582
or I don't know who
the fuck you think it is.

24:15.615 --> 24:17.317
It's a little pimp in there.

24:18.251 --> 24:21.688
Bitches is getting slapped
over in that house.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.723
Man, I know what I saw, man.
That was a goddamn vampire.

24:23.756 --> 24:25.325
Definitely.
I know what I saw.

24:25.358 --> 24:27.627
A pimp live next door
to us, okay?

24:27.660 --> 24:29.429
P-I-M-P.

24:29.462 --> 24:31.664
Put it in my pocket.

24:31.698 --> 24:35.401
The reason why he sleep all day?
Because pimping is at night!

24:35.435 --> 24:37.403
I'm gone. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

24:37.437 --> 24:39.038
I'm finna go write my book.

24:39.072 --> 24:40.673
You done lost
your motherfucking mind.

24:40.707 --> 24:42.542
You need to go sign
up for the circus.

24:42.575 --> 24:45.545
- Oh, man.
- Don't invite him in.

24:45.578 --> 24:47.146
What?

24:47.180 --> 24:49.148
Only way to keep a vampire
out of your house.

24:49.182 --> 24:51.217
Don't invite him in.

24:52.352 --> 24:53.820
I'm gone, man. I ain't...

24:53.853 --> 24:56.155
Yeah, you go, man.
We're gonna get to the bottom of it.

24:56.189 --> 24:58.224
I'm gonna do some research.
We'll figure it out, bro!

24:58.258 --> 25:00.059
- Just trust me!
- Shut the fuck up.

25:01.094 --> 25:02.762
Well, what about...
what about if you live in the RV?

25:02.795 --> 25:05.431
- Is there any rules there?
- Don't invite him in.

25:21.381 --> 25:23.683
I ain't got no more bananas,
'cause this shit is...

25:23.716 --> 25:26.419
They got... bats.

25:26.452 --> 25:28.087
Vampire coming at me.

25:28.121 --> 25:29.455
God, I didn't sign up
for this shit.

25:31.157 --> 25:35.128
Fucking nude.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.398
<i>Dispatch

25:38.431 --> 25:41.467
Do you know what
happens to snitches?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.576
Shit!

25:49.609 --> 25:53.146
These bitches bit
Snitch's neck!

25:53.179 --> 25:56.115
Mama! Oh, shit!
That was shit. They got me.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.452
Oh, damn. Oh, damn.

26:10.496 --> 26:13.132
<i>You know me as the one
that survived the Purge.</i>

26:13.166 --> 26:15.868
<i>Therefore, I could survive anything.</i>

26:15.902 --> 26:17.403
<i>What is going on
in your life?</i>

26:17.437 --> 26:19.539
- Late night?
- Oh. Hey.

26:19.572 --> 26:21.374
Yeah. It was
the worst last night.

26:21.407 --> 26:22.742
I can explain, though.

26:22.775 --> 26:25.678
Can you tell me
what happened with Allie?

26:25.712 --> 26:28.615
- She called you?
- She's mad because you don't trust her.

26:28.648 --> 26:29.816
No. She had
her little boy in my house.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.651
She ain't paying no
rent up in here.

26:31.684 --> 26:33.620
You need to be the bigger man
and call her and apologize,

26:33.653 --> 26:35.888
because I'm not dealing
with all of this mess.

26:35.922 --> 26:39.225
And speaking of which, did you call the
real estate agent like I asked you to?

26:39.258 --> 26:40.560
Oh, man.

26:40.593 --> 26:43.363
I'm mentally exhausted
from all of this.

26:43.396 --> 26:45.598
I'm having a hard
time writing, okay?

26:45.632 --> 26:47.634
<i>Lorena.</i>

26:49.769 --> 26:51.771
<i>Come, Lorena.</i>

26:51.804 --> 26:55.174
Oh, my God.

26:55.208 --> 26:57.844
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on with you?

26:57.877 --> 26:59.412
Oh, my God.

26:59.445 --> 27:00.747
<i>- Do you feel it...
- Oh, my God.</i>

27:00.780 --> 27:02.248
<i>- ...all over your body?
- Oh, shit.</i>

27:02.281 --> 27:03.282
How is this happening?

27:03.316 --> 27:04.684
Oh, my God.

27:04.717 --> 27:06.619
Am I missing out
on something?

27:06.653 --> 27:09.288
Oh, yes.
Don't stop.

27:09.322 --> 27:12.392
Oh, my. Carl.

27:12.425 --> 27:13.726
Carl,
did you hear that?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.528
Hey, you didn't... you
didn't came in here.

27:15.561 --> 27:18.197
Shhh!

27:18.231 --> 27:21.567
Okay, then.
That's what I needed.

27:21.601 --> 27:24.871
<i>Local authorities are
hesitant to label this a serial killer...</i>

27:24.904 --> 27:27.440
<i>- Oh, my God. - ...but sources
close to the investigation</i>

<i>were heard saying</i>

27:29.308 --> 27:32.745
<i>"This is some fucked up shit
right here, my nigga."</i>

27:32.779 --> 27:34.747
Who's doing all these terrible
things to these women?

27:34.781 --> 27:36.649
<i>- ...they went on to say the dead...
- Oh, my God.</i>

27:36.683 --> 27:38.584
I'm telling you,
we need to get out of here.

27:38.618 --> 27:40.486
Can you please, please
call that real estate man?

27:40.520 --> 27:42.221
- The paper's right there.
- I'm gonna call.

27:42.255 --> 27:43.489
- I'm gonna call him.
- Okay.

27:43.523 --> 27:44.991
<i>- ...signing off saying...

27:45.024 --> 27:47.827
<i>- Call him, please.

27:55.835 --> 27:57.503
Allie!

27:58.504 --> 28:00.940
This is my 17th message.

28:00.973 --> 28:03.843
Please call me back, okay?
I'm looking for you.

28:03.876 --> 28:06.579
I'm worried about you.
Call me back.

28:08.548 --> 28:09.949
Hey.

28:12.518 --> 28:13.986
Listen, I'm not letting
you in my house

28:14.020 --> 28:15.855
so you can tell them
same ghost stories...

28:15.888 --> 28:17.457
No, you need to see
this for real.

28:17.490 --> 28:18.958
<i>Snitch,
do you read me?</i>

28:18.991 --> 28:20.460
Look like
a busted bike to me.

28:20.493 --> 28:22.929
No, look.
This Rico bike.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.631
<i>- They done kidnapped Rico, bro.
- Dispatch to Snitch, over.</i>

28:25.665 --> 28:27.567
He don't go nowhere
without this bike.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.969
His license suspended.
He got no choice but to ride this bike.

28:30.002 --> 28:32.972
Look, Rico is a grown man
who done looked in the mirror

28:33.005 --> 28:34.841
and realized
he ain't got no business

28:34.874 --> 28:37.810
being 50 years old
on a tricycle.

28:37.844 --> 28:39.445
Or the vampires
could have got him.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.582
<i>Dispatch to Snitch, over.</i>

28:44.051 --> 28:46.018
Rico saw
something last night.

28:46.053 --> 28:47.954
I think I bet the vampires
snatched his ass up.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.989
<i>Snitch, what is your 411?</i>

28:50.022 --> 28:51.924
That's Freezee's car.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.360
In there pimping
my daughter!

29:01.734 --> 29:03.603
The sun's setting.

29:05.905 --> 29:08.541
The vampire's
about to wake up.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.276
Don't invite him in.

29:13.513 --> 29:15.048
<i>Imbecile!</i>

29:15.082 --> 29:16.949
<i>Damn it, man!
You scared the hell out of me!</i>

29:16.983 --> 29:19.619
<i>Who the hell you
callin' an imbecile?</i>

29:19.652 --> 29:22.789
<i>Now listen, you take your hands off of me!
I don't know you!</i>

29:27.360 --> 29:28.594
Whoop.

29:28.628 --> 29:30.463
- Stop playing!
- Got you.

29:30.496 --> 29:31.597
You little bitch.

29:36.170 --> 29:38.738
No, but for real, though, this is crazy.
What is we doing?

29:40.873 --> 29:42.608
I know Allie's
in this house.

29:42.642 --> 29:44.510
Allie!

29:44.544 --> 29:46.813
These maniacs done kidnapped Rico
and you just banging on the door?

29:46.846 --> 29:48.447
I've been calling
Allie all day

29:48.481 --> 29:49.849
and she ain't answer
the phone. Relax.

29:49.882 --> 29:51.617
Allie!

29:51.651 --> 29:54.520
- What the fuck?
- Can I help you, gentlemen?

29:54.554 --> 29:56.856
My daughter's
in there, man.

29:56.889 --> 29:59.492
Come on, man. Give me my daughter
back, man. This is crazy.

29:59.525 --> 30:01.761
You got the fuckin'
Halloween shit going on?

30:01.794 --> 30:03.596
That's my daughter!

30:03.629 --> 30:06.133
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean, neighbor.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.068
The car is in the back.

30:08.101 --> 30:10.070
I've been looking
for my daughter all day.

30:10.103 --> 30:11.604
Your pimping gonna stop.

30:11.637 --> 30:13.106
God don't like ugly, man.

30:13.140 --> 30:16.676
Mr. Black, your daughter
is not in this house.

30:16.709 --> 30:17.743
Ah!

30:20.113 --> 30:22.782
Can I come in the house?

30:22.815 --> 30:24.884
The doctor will not
be here until later.

30:24.917 --> 30:27.954
I wonder why? You got all them dead
bodies in there you don't want us to see?

30:27.987 --> 30:31.124
But, if you'd like
to come in, Mr. Black,

30:31.158 --> 30:36.462
you will find out in fact that
your daughter is not in this house.

30:36.495 --> 30:38.397
- We can come in and search the whole...
- Mr. Black, please.

30:38.431 --> 30:39.799
You want... that's what you
want us to do?

30:39.832 --> 30:41.367
Please.

30:43.736 --> 30:44.871
Be my guest.

30:44.904 --> 30:46.906
You want some real niggas...

30:46.939 --> 30:48.175
Enjoy yourselves, please.

30:48.208 --> 30:49.775
- ...come in your house?
- Go.

30:52.145 --> 30:54.181
Hey, stop.

30:57.217 --> 30:58.451
Allie!

30:58.484 --> 31:00.053
Allie!

31:01.754 --> 31:03.789
What?

31:03.823 --> 31:05.958
- Carl, look at this shit.
- What?

31:12.232 --> 31:14.867
That shit
look crazy, man.

31:14.901 --> 31:16.836
What the fuck is that
dog thing right there?

31:16.869 --> 31:18.038
- Mr. Black!
- Hey! Shit!

31:18.071 --> 31:19.839
Damn, bro!
What the fuck is going on?

31:19.872 --> 31:21.041
- What's wrong with you, bro?
- Don't touch these dolls.

31:21.074 --> 31:22.875
What is wrong with you?

31:22.909 --> 31:27.480
These are very, very expensive
West African voodoo totems.

31:27.513 --> 31:29.548
- The doctor is a collector.
- Allie!

31:32.052 --> 31:33.086
Allie!

31:37.556 --> 31:39.059
Allie! Whoa!

31:39.959 --> 31:42.029
- Is my daddy in here?
- Please come in, Allie.

31:42.062 --> 31:43.063
Carl.

31:44.830 --> 31:45.932
- What?
- Guess who come in.

31:45.965 --> 31:47.700
Dad! What are you
doing here?

31:47.733 --> 31:50.002
Allie, what are you doing?
Where your ass been at?

31:50.037 --> 31:51.238
What the hell's going on?

31:51.271 --> 31:52.972
Why are you
in these nice people's house?

31:53.005 --> 31:55.175
These people ain't nice.
This is a pimp's house.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.110
- This is a nice house.
- Oh, my God.

31:57.144 --> 31:59.046
Man, this is crazy!
Look, he's been putting

31:59.079 --> 32:01.681
all kind of crazy stories
in my head about you.

32:01.714 --> 32:03.516
The car's in the back...

32:03.549 --> 32:06.153
See, I knew you were going to
be tripping when you found out.

32:06.186 --> 32:08.554
God. Found out what?

32:09.356 --> 32:11.857
I just gotta tell you.
I'm just going to say it.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.895
- I'm movin' out.
- Movin' out where?

32:15.928 --> 32:17.964
Me and Freezee
are going to get married

32:17.997 --> 32:19.632
and we're going
to make a life together.

32:19.665 --> 32:22.035
I will take my belt off
and tear your ass up.

32:22.069 --> 32:24.904
Daddy, I can make my own choices.
It's called feminism.

32:24.937 --> 32:28.208
<i>Oh,
I know all about liberating some women.</i>

32:28.241 --> 32:30.077
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

32:38.718 --> 32:43.622
Let me introduce
Dr. Mamuwalde!

32:46.226 --> 32:48.661
Dr. Mamuwalde.

32:49.628 --> 32:51.831
Dr. Mamuwalde.

32:51.864 --> 32:54.101
Dr. Mamuwalde.

32:55.135 --> 32:57.170
Dr. Mamuwalde.

32:58.171 --> 33:00.673
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.576
So beautiful.

33:03.609 --> 33:05.745
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:07.247 --> 33:10.016
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:10.783 --> 33:13.753
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:13.786 --> 33:16.323
Is that a Black
bite-sized Hugh Hefner?

33:16.356 --> 33:18.991
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:19.025 --> 33:21.594
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:22.795 --> 33:25.098
Dr. Mamuwalde.

33:25.132 --> 33:26.732
All right, man.

33:26.766 --> 33:29.735
Monty, I told you,
three times.

33:29.769 --> 33:31.271
Yeah, nigga, damn.

33:31.304 --> 33:33.073
Every day is a struggle,

33:33.106 --> 33:36.276
but every night
is a feast, you feel me?

33:36.309 --> 33:39.779
Carl Black!
Show me some love.

33:39.812 --> 33:41.114
I can give you some
from right here.

33:41.148 --> 33:42.848
I can't come over
and give up no...

33:42.882 --> 33:45.218
- no love shit, dog.
- Mm-mm.

33:45.252 --> 33:49.256
Welcome to my humble abode,
Carl Black.

33:49.289 --> 33:51.291
How the fuck
do you know my name?

33:51.324 --> 33:54.593
That's what's crazy.
You been on my IG page?

33:54.627 --> 33:56.929
Oh, I've had
my third eye on you.

33:56.962 --> 33:58.631
I mean, if it was about
that shit the other night,

33:58.664 --> 33:59.865
all right, look,
I ain't got...

33:59.899 --> 34:02.335
The doctor is
a fan of your book...

34:02.369 --> 34:03.370
- Ooh.
- Mr. Black.

34:03.403 --> 34:05.338
Shit. Mm.

34:05.372 --> 34:08.007
And doodoo is
a fan of your mouth.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.009
- Dad.
- You know my book?

34:10.043 --> 34:11.378
- Wow.
- Mm.

34:11.411 --> 34:13.012
I told you, you got
to get back in there.

34:13.046 --> 34:15.115
You know he's in, uh,
a tough spot right now.

34:15.148 --> 34:16.615
- He's in a artistic bind.
- Yeah. I'm trying to write a new book.

34:16.649 --> 34:18.318
Yeah. You see,
the first one was good.

34:18.351 --> 34:20.153
- Yeah. The second one.
- Now, I'm trying to do...

34:20.187 --> 34:22.189
- I'm trying to do the second one.
- Gotta be off the chain.

34:22.222 --> 34:23.856
It's a fine piece
of literature.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.858
The shit was
a modern-day classic.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.296
Dr. Mamuwalde.

34:29.329 --> 34:32.932
What type of medicine
you practice, bro?

34:32.965 --> 34:35.168
I practice
the type of medicine

34:35.202 --> 34:37.736
for those
with a particular affliction.

34:37.770 --> 34:40.673
Take two of these and call me in the morning.

34:41.907 --> 34:44.111
Oh, this.

34:44.144 --> 34:45.245
Bless his name.

34:45.278 --> 34:47.147
I knew you was a pimp.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.715
- Ha. Such harsh language, Mr. Black.
- Yeah.

34:49.748 --> 34:51.984
I am a purveyor
and provocateur

34:52.017 --> 34:55.888
of fine ass bitches
and high-priced pleasure.

34:55.921 --> 34:58.291
I know what I'm looking at
when I see it.

34:58.325 --> 35:00.093
Hold on. Wait a minute,
little George Jefferson.

35:00.127 --> 35:02.728
We ain't doing no provocative
nothin' around here.

35:02.761 --> 35:04.131
This is my daughter.

35:04.164 --> 35:06.166
Ain't nothin' going up
in there but a tampon.

35:06.199 --> 35:07.766
- Daddy!
- Mr. Black, I assure you,

35:07.800 --> 35:10.903
I may be a pimp,
but I am no monster.

35:10.936 --> 35:13.406
Matter of fact, to prove my point,

35:13.440 --> 35:18.777
allow me. A mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

35:18.811 --> 35:21.013
This is for your education.

35:21.047 --> 35:22.048
Really?

35:26.486 --> 35:28.321
- No.
- Ooh. Daddy!

35:28.355 --> 35:31.124
No! We ain't raisin'
no THOTs around here!

35:31.158 --> 35:32.992
- We ain't doing no THOTin'!
- But we need the money!

35:33.025 --> 35:35.395
You... but we ain't getting
the money that kind of way.

35:35.428 --> 35:38.231
We sellin' books
around here, not pussy!

35:38.265 --> 35:40.966
The Black man has yet again
said no to education.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.336
- Fuck you! Come on. Get your ass out of here.
- Daddy!

35:43.370 --> 35:45.804
- Why are you always yelling at people?
- Fuck you, Mr. Mamuwalde.

35:45.838 --> 35:47.740
Thank you, nice man!

35:47.773 --> 35:50.443
Well, let me just say I'm
having a soirée tomorrow night

35:50.477 --> 35:52.745
and I would be honored
if you would join me.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.648
I'm expensive!

35:59.052 --> 36:02.155
Tomorrow night is the soirée.

36:02.189 --> 36:03.223
Oh, oh.

36:04.857 --> 36:08.128
- Save them for me.
- We expect to be seeing you.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.076
You always do this,
Daddy.

36:23.109 --> 36:24.977
Why wouldn't you let
that pretty man help me?

36:25.010 --> 36:27.080
Dolomite was trying
to get in your panties.

36:27.113 --> 36:28.981
- We don't need his money.
- No.

36:29.014 --> 36:31.518
<i>We don't need the money.
I need the money, Dad.</i>

36:31.551 --> 36:34.187
I just want to get my education,
so I don't end up like you.

36:34.221 --> 36:35.422
- Like me?
- Yes, Daddy.

36:35.455 --> 36:36.889
Just write the book
or get a job.

36:36.922 --> 36:38.191
Get a job,
broke nigga!

36:38.225 --> 36:39.992
I got some money
on your hair, Freezee.

36:40.025 --> 36:41.860
I'm about to unthaw yo ass.

36:41.894 --> 36:43.463
- I'm leaving.
- Allie.

36:43.496 --> 36:45.232
And me and Freezee are gonna
live happily ever after together.

36:45.265 --> 36:46.865
- Allie Black.
- That is what we're doing.

36:46.899 --> 36:48.268
- Freezee! Let's go!
- Allie Black.

36:48.301 --> 36:49.768
Allie! Allie!

36:49.802 --> 36:51.037
I think she just called
you a dumbass.

36:51.071 --> 36:52.172
Stop yelling
in the neighborhood!

36:52.205 --> 36:54.006
- Allie.
- We're going.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.042
- Baby, tuck my legs in.
- I got you.

36:57.143 --> 36:58.911
- Baby.
- Look at that.

36:58.944 --> 37:00.447
Always falling like this.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.249
Carl!

37:02.282 --> 37:04.551
Why is she leaving like that, baby?
We just talked about this.

37:04.584 --> 37:06.519
- Baby, I...
- Well-well, the neighbor next door

37:06.553 --> 37:08.821

vampire pimp money

37:08.854 --> 37:11.224
to Allie for school
and goddamn hatin' ass Carl,

37:11.258 --> 37:14.094
he gon' take the money and throw
it back in the goddamn vampire face

37:14.127 --> 37:15.495
and goddamn Allie,
goddamn...

37:15.528 --> 37:18.864
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
calm down, little infant!

37:18.897 --> 37:20.933
Vampire?
Vampire pimp?

37:20.966 --> 37:23.203
That's what you guys are out
here talking about right now?

37:23.236 --> 37:25.804
- No. It ain't even like that.
- We just had this conversation.

37:25.838 --> 37:28.508
- Hey.
- I'm tired of all this craziness.

37:28.541 --> 37:30.510
Did you call the real estate
agent like I asked you to?

37:30.543 --> 37:33.513
Called the real estate agent.
I... I left a message for him.

37:33.546 --> 37:36.383
Look, Carl, I'll call him,
just like I do

37:36.416 --> 37:38.518
- everything else around here, okay?
- Oh-oh.

37:38.551 --> 37:41.254
But you know what, we need to talk
tonight when I get home from work.

37:41.288 --> 37:43.123
Oh-oh.

37:43.156 --> 37:45.125
- Babe, don't do that.
- I gotta go to work.

37:45.158 --> 37:46.859
- She's gonna cheat on you.
- Shut up, Cronut.

37:46.892 --> 37:47.993
It's me, baby.

37:48.028 --> 37:49.362
- Yeah.
- Babe.

37:50.563 --> 37:53.033
Yeah, she gonna cheat on you.

37:54.434 --> 37:56.069
I'm gonna cheat on you.

37:56.102 --> 37:58.371
Carl. Carl.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.141
Carl!

38:01.174 --> 38:03.008
- Carl!
- What?

38:03.043 --> 38:04.943
Gotta listen to me.
You gotta hear me out for real.

38:04.977 --> 38:06.945
I know you're going
through a lot.

38:06.979 --> 38:09.182
I know your old lady trippin',
I know your daughter trippin',

38:09.215 --> 38:10.483
I know you have
a writer's block,

38:10.517 --> 38:12.419
but please, bro,
just listen to me.

38:12.452 --> 38:15.488
Go home. All right?
It's over.

38:15.522 --> 38:17.257
I'm movin' the fuck
out of this house.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.326
This our house!
We can't let him move us out.

38:19.359 --> 38:21.494
- I don't wannna hear that shit.
- I gotta tell you this for real.

38:21.528 --> 38:24.431
Guess what I found while you
was talking to the pimp vampire?

38:24.464 --> 38:26.566
These Rico glasses, man.
They probably got him.

38:26.599 --> 38:29.235
They done... they done drunk all
his blood and everything, man.

38:29.269 --> 38:31.538
Stop! That motherfucker
just tried to play me.

38:31.571 --> 38:32.971
He's going to jail.

38:33.005 --> 38:35.208
Three hots and a cot,
he's going to jail.

38:35.241 --> 38:37.310
So, what you
gonna do about it?

38:37.344 --> 38:39.379
The little motherfucker's going to jail
for pimping and pandering around here.

38:39.412 --> 38:40.946
What you mean,
what I'm gonna do?

38:40.979 --> 38:43.949
Police ain't never arrestin'
no goddamn vampire.

38:43.982 --> 38:45.652
That's shit, okay?

38:45.685 --> 38:48.088
Did you see he floated down the stairs?

38:48.121 --> 38:49.556
You didn't see him float?

38:49.589 --> 38:51.391
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

38:51.424 --> 38:53.493
Yes, I have
a problem here.

38:53.526 --> 38:56.162
Um,
I'm a new neighbor

38:56.196 --> 38:58.131
that just moved
in the neighborhood.

38:58.164 --> 39:00.066
As you can tell,
I'm Caucasian.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.602
And there's
a real peculiar guy.

39:02.635 --> 39:04.604
<i>- Is he Black? Okay.
- Yes, he's Black.</i>

39:04.637 --> 39:06.172
<i>We'll send over
five units right away.</i>

39:06.206 --> 39:07.607
Okay, you'll be here
in a second?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.676
<i>- Right away.
- Thank you.</i>

39:09.709 --> 39:13.046
That's how you do that.

39:13.079 --> 39:14.414
He's going to jail.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.159
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, fall back, fall back.

39:26.192 --> 39:28.161
- What's going on?
- I'm the lead cop on this.

39:28.194 --> 39:30.363
- Laced, you're a rookie.
- Listen, I'm just tryin' to have some fun.

39:30.397 --> 39:32.432
I said
fall back, man.

39:32.465 --> 39:34.200
Listen, I got my gun.
I'm going to this house to have some fun.

39:34.234 --> 39:35.468
Do my thing.

39:37.036 --> 39:39.506
All right. Go ahead.
Handle this.

39:39.539 --> 39:41.207
What kind of spooky shit
is this?

39:41.241 --> 39:44.043
First time bein' a cop.
This is gonna be a breeze.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.112
That like a old couple
relationship.

39:52.152 --> 39:53.520
Come on out of there

39:53.553 --> 39:55.455
- before I put a hot one in your ass!
- Hold on.

39:55.488 --> 39:56.723
There'll be no gun violence.
Put your gun down. This is my first day.

39:56.756 --> 39:58.458
Shut up and stop
being a little bitch.

40:03.163 --> 40:05.298
Two of them in up
there, weird as hell.

40:05.331 --> 40:07.233
Lock his ass up.

40:07.267 --> 40:08.368
He got Rico.

40:11.171 --> 40:14.374
- Police.
- Good heavens! What is all the fuss?

40:14.407 --> 40:17.610
Oh, a father
and son team, splendid.

40:17.644 --> 40:19.679
What may I do for you,
dark-skinned Hutch?

40:19.712 --> 40:22.449
Listen, big fella.
Dude down there saying y'all been involved

40:22.482 --> 40:24.617
in the kidnappin' of the
neighborhood watch captain?

40:24.651 --> 40:25.984
Rico.

40:26.018 --> 40:27.320
- So y'all kidnap him?
- Yeah.

40:27.353 --> 40:28.521
And I heard you got hoes
all up in through there.

40:28.555 --> 40:29.689
Y'all freaky-freaky, huh?

40:29.722 --> 40:31.324
Not at all, sir.

40:31.357 --> 40:33.660
This is the residence
of Dr. Mamuwalde.

40:33.693 --> 40:36.429
<i>- Mama-who?
- Can't a man pimp in peace?</i>

40:38.264 --> 40:40.700
The name is
Dr. Mamuwalde.

40:42.235 --> 40:44.204
- Shit.
- He trippin'-trippin'.

40:44.237 --> 40:46.105
I hope they get
his ass, man.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.774
Listen, big fella,
do you mind if I have a look inside,

40:47.807 --> 40:49.409
see what's going on
see what I can steal?

40:49.442 --> 40:51.177
I mean, just see what's
going on in the house.

40:51.211 --> 40:54.414
Absolutely. My house
is your house, officer.

40:54.447 --> 40:56.216
Feel free to look around

40:56.249 --> 40:59.486
- as soon as you present your warrant.
- He trippin'.

40:59.519 --> 41:01.287
- Warrant?
- Yes, warrant.

41:01.321 --> 41:04.123
What the fuck? You 'posed to
be an expert on the law now?

41:04.157 --> 41:07.126
I'm gonna show you what we do
with experts down here, hm?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.528
Hold on, what you doing?

41:08.561 --> 41:10.597
No! Put the taser off!
Put the taser off!

41:10.630 --> 41:13.299
- You trippin'-trippin'.
- Uh-huh, bust him. Bust him.

41:13.333 --> 41:15.535
- Put your taser off.
- Don't eyeball me, boy.

41:15.568 --> 41:17.237
Don't play with me.

41:17.270 --> 41:18.671
We just want to know if you
know about the whereabouts

41:18.705 --> 41:21.174
of this Rico guy.
Where is Rico?

41:21.207 --> 41:24.477
You're the one supposed
to be looking

41:24.511 --> 41:27.380
for whoever you're
looking for, sir.

41:27.413 --> 41:30.617
I don't know who Rico is
and you can't make me.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.151
He's lying, man.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.786
How y'all gonna believe

41:33.820 --> 41:36.756
somebody dressed like
Dr. Seuss is what I'm sayin'?

41:36.789 --> 41:38.758
What do you do, sir?
For a living?

41:38.791 --> 41:42.595
Well, for a living,
I take fantasy and dreams

41:42.629 --> 41:45.665
and I make them
into reality.

41:45.698 --> 41:49.168
Let me tell you something,
creepy motherfucker. You got two options.

41:49.202 --> 41:53.339
Option A, we look around
inside this spooky motherfucker,

41:53.373 --> 41:55.642
or option B, we're gonna
arrest your ass,

41:55.675 --> 41:58.144
take you down to the precinct,
ask you a bunch of goddamn questions.

41:58.177 --> 42:00.680
He's going to jail. That's
what I'm talking about.

42:00.713 --> 42:03.149
I'll take... I haven't even
chosen my options.

42:03.182 --> 42:04.784
Oh, we're gonna do it.
We're gonna take him now.

42:04.817 --> 42:07.387
Option A, I don't.
Option B...

42:07.420 --> 42:08.755
We're gonna take
you downtown, Midnite.

42:08.788 --> 42:10.490
Wait a minute.

42:10.523 --> 42:13.526
How can you call me "midnight"
as dark as you are...

42:13.560 --> 42:16.095
- What? What did you say?
- ...ith all due respect, officer?

42:16.129 --> 42:19.132
Well, if I'm Midnight,
aren't you two Nights?

42:19.165 --> 42:21.200
There ain't shit you're gonna do about it.
Come on with your little...

42:21.234 --> 42:22.735
- Stop resisting.
- They're taking him to jail.

42:22.769 --> 42:24.771
That's what I'm talking about.
Do your job.

42:24.804 --> 42:27.206
This is definitely
Black on Black crime.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.342
Hey, I got it.
Take his Black ass down.

42:42.522 --> 42:43.856
Officer!

42:43.890 --> 42:45.725
I believe there's been
a misunderstanding.

42:47.860 --> 42:49.596
Do you mean this Rico?

42:54.867 --> 42:57.270
Rico, what the fuck
you doing in there?

42:57.303 --> 43:00.473
I'm fine. I was just
in the basement...

43:00.506 --> 43:02.275
They didn't fondle with you
down there, did they?

43:02.308 --> 43:03.676
They did me fine.

43:03.710 --> 43:06.779
- They served me fresh bananas.
- From Honduras.

43:06.813 --> 43:08.247
Bananas in the basement?

43:08.281 --> 43:09.916
They done brainwashed
his crazy ass.

43:09.949 --> 43:11.317
They did more
than brainwashing.

43:11.351 --> 43:13.252
Somethin' ain't
right with him.

43:26.933 --> 43:29.802
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

43:37.710 --> 43:40.313
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

43:41.447 --> 43:43.783
<i>I've been searching for you.</i>

43:45.785 --> 43:51.424
<i>Are you feeling my breath
upon your corpuscle?</i>

44:01.768 --> 44:03.603
What kind
of cop shit is this?

44:03.636 --> 44:04.937
Y'all let him go?

44:04.971 --> 44:07.507
Mr. Black, you call us
down here again

44:07.540 --> 44:08.775
and waste our damn time,

44:08.808 --> 44:11.377
I'm gonna take
your ashy ass to jail.

44:11.411 --> 44:12.912
We cop cops.
This ain't no damn joke!

44:12.945 --> 44:15.415
Man, if you don't get
your retarded ass...

44:15.448 --> 44:18.785
You better watch your mouth, before I
stick these goddamn handcuffs up your ass.

44:18.818 --> 44:20.920
Don't eyeball me, boy.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.789
Let's go.

44:24.824 --> 44:27.560
Carl, why are you
here with the police?

44:27.593 --> 44:29.395
What did the neighbor
do to you?

44:29.429 --> 44:31.831
This is what happens when you
keep messing with the neighbors.

44:31.864 --> 44:33.433
Why are you blamin'
him for everything?

44:33.466 --> 44:35.368
Because clearly, I see
you out here too.

44:35.401 --> 44:37.570
For real, this is your plan.
Don't try to put this on me.

44:37.603 --> 44:39.439
- We're movin' out.
- What do you mean? Wait!

44:39.472 --> 44:41.274
- Without you.
- How you gonna move out without me?

44:41.307 --> 44:42.809
- We family.
- No. We not family.

44:42.842 --> 44:44.711
You're just my cousin
that fucks up everything.

44:44.744 --> 44:45.878
- That's family.
- You know what?

44:45.912 --> 44:48.247
I'm tired of you
always blamin' him.

44:48.281 --> 44:50.583
Look right here. This is what it's
about, me and you. You're messing up.

44:58.658 --> 45:00.760
- Babe. I can explain.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

45:00.793 --> 45:04.297
The motherfucker was trying to
disrespect me in front of my daughter.

45:04.330 --> 45:06.699
I'm tired of you
embarrassing our family.

45:08.367 --> 45:10.303
You owe that man
an apology.

45:10.336 --> 45:11.838
Babe...

45:13.473 --> 45:15.908
I don't know
if this is it for us.

45:15.942 --> 45:19.746
I used to think it was the house,
the neighborhood, your book.

45:19.779 --> 45:22.415
But it's not.

45:22.448 --> 45:25.017
It's you.

45:25.052 --> 45:26.819
It's you and I
that don't work.

45:32.492 --> 45:35.962
I got to go back to work.
So you figure that out.

45:37.797 --> 45:41.300
I'll apologize.
I'll go apologize.

45:41.334 --> 45:44.737
I don't have a problem
apologizing to him.

45:44.771 --> 45:47.406
<i>Attack and bring me my wife.</i>

45:48.975 --> 45:51.010
Right this
way, Mr. Black.

45:51.044 --> 45:53.479
The good doctor'll be here
to deal with you shortly.

45:53.513 --> 45:55.548
Hey, man. Did you
just change your accent?

45:55.581 --> 45:58.718
Where'd he go? What the fuck
was he saying?

46:00.553 --> 46:02.655
Wow.

46:02.688 --> 46:03.890
It's nice, though.

46:07.393 --> 46:08.661
- Carl Black.
- Hey!

46:08.694 --> 46:11.531
What the fuck!
Jesus, Buddha, Allah!

46:13.066 --> 46:15.368
Is every place in here creepy?

46:15.401 --> 46:18.071
I thought I smelled
failure in here.

46:18.105 --> 46:22.508
And I thought I smelled Celine
Dion's wig also in here.

46:22.542 --> 46:24.944
You're a funny
motherfucker, Carl.

46:24.977 --> 46:28.581
And I don't just mean that
dumb expression on your face.

46:28.614 --> 46:32.119
Yeah? Well, look,
let me be straight up with you, all right?

46:32.152 --> 46:33.686
- Thank you.
- I don't like you.

46:33.719 --> 46:34.887
First time I seen you,

46:34.921 --> 46:37.124
- just didn't like you.
- Okay.

46:37.157 --> 46:41.394
My wife sent me over here to apologize
to you and that's what I want to do.

46:41.427 --> 46:43.896
I want to apologize,
but I just want to let you know,

46:43.930 --> 46:46.399
I don't give a fuck.

46:46.432 --> 46:47.767
We getting the fuck out
of this neighborhood.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.403
Well, that's very
interesting, Green Lantern,

46:50.436 --> 46:52.572
but you can't leave
just yet.

46:52.605 --> 46:54.074
Oh, yes, I can! Shit!

46:54.107 --> 46:55.575
My lease is up next month.

46:57.777 --> 46:58.878
What's this?

46:58.911 --> 47:00.780
There's something
I want from you

47:00.813 --> 47:02.949
and you're not
leaving until I get it.

47:02.982 --> 47:05.885
Man, I hope it's my nuts
for these girls.

47:05.918 --> 47:07.453
No!

47:09.122 --> 47:12.692
My book.
You like my book?

47:12.725 --> 47:14.927
I told you I was a fan
of your book.

47:14.961 --> 47:17.396
- That is crazy.
- It was magnificent.

47:17.430 --> 47:18.598
You like my book.

47:18.631 --> 47:20.700
I like you
and your family, Carl.

47:20.733 --> 47:21.934
And not everybody
in my family

47:21.968 --> 47:23.970
agreed with you moving in
next door to us.

47:24.003 --> 47:25.705
Your wife.

47:25.738 --> 47:28.007
My wife? Lorena?

47:28.041 --> 47:29.609
Lorena.

47:29.642 --> 47:32.778
Oh, no. She ain't...
she ain't into no pimping shit.

47:32.812 --> 47:35.082
She ain't into no pimping shit
and I ain't either, okay?

47:35.115 --> 47:36.782
Tried it, didn't like it.

47:36.816 --> 47:40.920
And my daughter?
That's off limits.

47:40.953 --> 47:43.689
You're too grown to be messing
with anybody's daughter.

47:43.723 --> 47:45.658
Ain't no man gonna let you
mess with they daughter.

47:45.691 --> 47:48.861
She's still a little girl.
She's still doing Juicy Juices.

47:48.895 --> 47:51.631
She's not a grown lady.
She don't know what YAK is,

47:51.664 --> 47:53.566
nor does she know
what Gray Goose is.

47:53.599 --> 47:57.137
I had no idea how old she was.
She was my size.

47:57.170 --> 47:59.639
Keep your little
one, two, three, four, five,

47:59.672 --> 48:03.210
six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve fingers

48:03.243 --> 48:05.544
away from my daughter,
blah-blah.

48:05.578 --> 48:06.779
Big mistake.

48:06.812 --> 48:08.115
Don't fuck with my daughter.

48:08.148 --> 48:10.583
And Cronut,
he's a character.

48:10.616 --> 48:12.485
Oh, Cronut?
You can have him.

48:12.518 --> 48:15.788
Ugh. No one wants Cronut.

48:15.821 --> 48:17.124
You can fuck him
if you want.

48:18.724 --> 48:21.128
He's crazy.
He's the one that think

48:21.161 --> 48:24.864
Michael Jackson and Biggie
and Tupac is still living,

48:24.897 --> 48:27.533
and-and thinks O.J.
didn't do it.

48:27.566 --> 48:29.169
He's got a whole lot
of shit in his head.

48:29.202 --> 48:32.039
And he gave me some crazy
theories about you too.

48:32.072 --> 48:35.808
I'mma go ahead and sign this autograph
'fore I can get on out of here.

48:37.877 --> 48:40.780
And what was his theory
about me?

48:40.813 --> 48:44.617
We still don't know why you
moved in the neighborhood...

49:01.867 --> 49:05.172
What the fuck!
What's wrong with you?

49:05.205 --> 49:08.208
Egad, Carl Black.

49:08.241 --> 49:10.876
Do I detect hostility
in your voice?

49:10.910 --> 49:12.545
I thought we were cool now.

49:12.578 --> 49:13.846
No, we're not cool!

49:13.879 --> 49:17.750
And you do detect
hostility in my voice.

49:17.783 --> 49:20.220
You got a picture of my wife
naked on your fucking wall!

49:20.253 --> 49:22.189
I ain't even got
a picture of this bitch.

49:22.222 --> 49:24.523
- Did you photoshop the picture?
- No.

49:25.958 --> 49:27.127
No, that's her.

49:27.160 --> 49:31.231
I bet I know what Cronut
thinks about me.

49:31.264 --> 49:33.799
You know what?

49:33.833 --> 49:37.237
<i>He was right.</i>

50:00.227 --> 50:02.062
What are you doing?

50:02.095 --> 50:03.829
Be quiet.
I know what I'm doing.

50:03.863 --> 50:05.664
Would you...
Dad, come on.

50:05.698 --> 50:07.767
Son, I got something
I need to talk to you about.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.568
All right.

50:09.602 --> 50:11.971
We got a vampire living next door!
I've seen him!

50:12.004 --> 50:14.940
- Hey, that's cool!
- I think I've seen that dude.

50:14.974 --> 50:16.709
What's so...
What the fuck is wrong...

50:16.742 --> 50:18.111
What's cool about that?

50:18.145 --> 50:20.880
Dad, Dad, just relax.
Just call the cops.

50:20.913 --> 50:22.215
I can't call the cops.

50:22.249 --> 50:24.084
Okay, everybody knows
the vampire rules.

50:24.117 --> 50:25.885
Like, a vampire
cannot come in your house

50:25.918 --> 50:28.321
unless you invite him in.
Did you invite him in?

50:28.355 --> 50:30.123
- No. I didn't invite him in.
- All right.

50:30.157 --> 50:31.690
All right, then you're good.
That's good.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.060
- I'm cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:33.093 --> 50:34.660
Come on now.
Everybody knows that.

50:34.693 --> 50:36.196
It's in literally
every vampire comic book.

50:36.229 --> 50:37.297
Every one.

50:37.330 --> 50:40.933
Oh, man.
You got some weed?

50:40.966 --> 50:42.802
Dad, what?
Just leave. Just leave.

50:44.037 --> 50:45.738
I know who got it.

50:45.771 --> 50:47.773
No, he doesn't. He's kidding.
Bro, shut up.

50:47.807 --> 50:49.276
- A dime bag? Twenty?
- No, no. Leave. Leave. He's kidding.

50:49.309 --> 50:51.777
He's kidding. He's kidding.
Go take a nap.

50:51.811 --> 50:54.047
- But I do.
- Just be quiet. Just stop.

51:03.290 --> 51:05.624
I'm gonna watch you
all night, motherfucker.

51:36.423 --> 51:38.924
Don't invite him in.

51:47.367 --> 51:49.269
Oh, shit.

51:54.940 --> 51:56.109
Give me your money.

51:56.143 --> 51:57.776
Please don't hurt me.

51:57.810 --> 51:59.146
Please don't hurt...

52:23.802 --> 52:25.838
Hi, Carl.

52:31.977 --> 52:34.181
<i>No.</i>

52:35.448 --> 52:37.284
<i>No.
I'm being serious.</i>

52:37.317 --> 52:41.188
I'm telling you, it's been an
interesting week and I apologize.

52:41.221 --> 52:44.257
I feel the timing of it all
is pretty, um, special,

52:44.291 --> 52:47.960
that you would... I don't know where
you came from, but I appreciate it.

52:47.993 --> 52:51.231
And I think it's important
that we met tonight

52:51.264 --> 52:53.400
because I wanted to really
apologize for the other night.

52:53.433 --> 52:56.069
I know my husband
was in there tonight.

52:56.102 --> 52:58.737
Is everything okay?
Mamuwalde, right?

52:58.771 --> 53:01.740
I have to, um, really
get this out,

53:01.774 --> 53:05.178
because I feel like I'm having a little
bit of an out-of-body experience,

53:05.212 --> 53:09.149
because I typically don't invite
complete strangers into my house

53:09.182 --> 53:12.419
to have a glass of wine.
In this case...

53:12.452 --> 53:14.354
<i>Don't invite him in.</i>

53:18.491 --> 53:20.960
- Hey.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

53:22.995 --> 53:24.364
What you doing?

53:24.397 --> 53:26.132
Baby, hi.
Hi. Were you sleeping?

53:26.166 --> 53:29.269
What is he doing here?
He's not supposed to be here.

53:29.302 --> 53:32.172
Where are your manners, baby?
This is Dr. Mamuwalde.

53:32.205 --> 53:34.307
- Our neighbor from earlier...
- I know what you doing!

53:34.341 --> 53:36.176
Yes, where are
your manners, baby?

53:36.209 --> 53:38.144
He's not supposed
to be in this house.

53:38.178 --> 53:40.012
I invited him to have
a glass of wine with me

53:40.046 --> 53:41.780
because if anything,
we owe him a thank you.

53:41.814 --> 53:43.450
- I don't wanna hear all that.
- If it wasn't for our neighbor,

53:43.483 --> 53:45.051
I would have gotten
mugged tonight.

53:45.085 --> 53:47.187
You got mugged?

53:47.220 --> 53:48.854
He swooped... Where did you come from?
Where? How did you get there?

53:48.887 --> 53:51.157
- Swooped.
- What happened?

53:51.191 --> 53:55.095
Fortunately for you, I happened to be in
the area looking for a late-night snack

53:55.128 --> 53:59.032
and happened to stumble
upon your tastiness.

53:59.065 --> 54:00.500
He's not supposed
to be in our home.

54:00.533 --> 54:02.835
He was not invited by no one.

54:02.868 --> 54:04.903
Under ordinary circumstances,

54:04.937 --> 54:07.107
Carl Black here
would be right,

54:07.140 --> 54:09.975
<i>- but I was invited, Carl.
- You know the rules.</i>

54:10.009 --> 54:12.512
- His kind is not invited in our house.
- Listen...

54:12.545 --> 54:14.880
- My kind?
- Yeah.

54:14.913 --> 54:18.451
That is a racist
statement, Negro.

54:18.485 --> 54:20.553
I'll have you know,

54:20.587 --> 54:24.524
in this age of divisiveness
and bigotry,

54:24.557 --> 54:27.026
we can't do this
to each other.

54:28.194 --> 54:29.362
Sheesh!

54:29.396 --> 54:31.531
Yes. Baby, listen,
please just calm down.

54:31.564 --> 54:33.566
We got a real live
vampire in my house

54:33.600 --> 54:35.101
and you're telling me
to calm down?

54:35.135 --> 54:37.404
If I had a wife as fine
as yours,

54:37.437 --> 54:40.140
I'd never let her out
of my sight.

54:40.173 --> 54:42.575
Hey, man! What-what-what
you doing? You can't do that, man.

54:42.609 --> 54:44.311
What the fuck!
What if I grab your hair, man?

54:44.344 --> 54:48.013
<i>Do not...</i>

54:48.048 --> 54:50.883
touch my hair,
Carl Black.

54:50.916 --> 54:52.285
You got two Bo Derek braids

54:52.319 --> 54:53.852
hanging on both
sides of your face

54:53.886 --> 54:56.089
and you gon' touch
on my girl's shit.

54:56.122 --> 54:58.358
Baby, just calm down, okay?

54:58.391 --> 55:00.460
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

55:00.493 --> 55:02.562
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing, Carl?

55:02.595 --> 55:04.331
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

55:04.364 --> 55:06.433
- Ouch!
- You know I'm clumsy a little bit.

55:27.986 --> 55:31.157
That looks
exquisitely painful.

55:31.191 --> 55:33.360
Ah-ah-ah. Go in there
and rinse your arm off.

55:33.393 --> 55:35.128
- I got it, Carl. I got it.
- Yeah, you cut your hand

55:35.161 --> 55:37.530
'cause you're standing up there
reckless eyeballing.

55:37.564 --> 55:39.099
I got it.
Dr. Mamuwalde,

55:39.132 --> 55:41.501
it was really,
really nice to meet you.

55:41.534 --> 55:43.969
- Well, go wash your hand, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I'm...

55:44.002 --> 55:45.138
Put a band-aid on it.

55:45.171 --> 55:47.440
O-positive we'll see
each other again.

55:47.474 --> 55:50.410
<i>Listen, you little neglected
Harry Potter cast member,</i>

55:50.443 --> 55:52.345
let me tell you something.

55:52.379 --> 55:55.582
That's my princess,
and that's my wife, and I love her.

55:55.615 --> 55:57.650
You're not going
to destroy my family!

55:57.684 --> 56:00.986
What do you intend
to do about it, Carl Black?

56:01.019 --> 56:03.323
Install my cable,
motherfucker?

56:03.356 --> 56:05.191
Nah.

56:05.225 --> 56:09.995
I'm gonna pimp-slap the shit
out of your ass, motherfucker!

56:13.099 --> 56:14.401
Damn, you're strong!

56:14.434 --> 56:18.204
Let me tell you
a little story.

56:20.240 --> 56:24.177
<i>I've been looking
for Lorena for centuries.</i>

56:24.210 --> 56:29.014
<i>I first laid eyes on that fine
young thing in the Caribbean.</i>

56:29.048 --> 56:32.485
<i>Lost her, found her again.</i>

56:32.519 --> 56:37.190
<i>I've seen all types of women
in all shapes and sizes,</i>

56:37.223 --> 56:41.361
<i>but none compare
to the governor's daughter.</i>

56:41.394 --> 56:43.096
<i>We were in love</i>

56:43.129 --> 56:46.299
<i>and I was finally
going to make her mine.</i>

56:59.612 --> 57:02.515
You were warned, vampire.

57:03.383 --> 57:08.388
Tonight's the night
that I send your soul to hell!

57:08.421 --> 57:10.390
Demon!

57:10.423 --> 57:13.126
Come, woman.

57:13.159 --> 57:15.395
No. No. No!

57:15.428 --> 57:18.398
<i>They took the love
of my life from me</i>

57:18.431 --> 57:22.602
<i>and I have been looking for my
Puerto Rican princess ever since.</i>

57:26.639 --> 57:30.109
Go to hell, vampire.

57:33.646 --> 57:36.616
<i>They took my life.</i>

57:39.352 --> 57:41.287
Man, that was a cool story!

57:41.321 --> 57:46.059
But the real fact is,
is that's my wife, and I love her.

57:46.092 --> 57:47.660
And you're not gonna
destroy my family.

57:47.694 --> 57:51.264
You're doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.

57:51.297 --> 57:52.699
What the fuck?

57:52.732 --> 57:54.634
She will be mine.

57:58.071 --> 58:00.406
No, no!

58:01.708 --> 58:03.276
<i>Mine...</i>

58:03.309 --> 58:04.777
Carl Black!

58:13.786 --> 58:16.723
<i>The authorities
are still in shambles</i>

58:16.756 --> 58:19.058
<i>as they scurry about for clues</i>

58:19.092 --> 58:22.128
<i>- in the murders of these prostitutes.
- Wow.</i>

58:22.161 --> 58:25.498
<i>If anyone out there has any
information or any leads...</i>

58:25.532 --> 58:27.500
<i>- Damn.
- ...feel free</i>

58:27.534 --> 58:30.537
<i>to DM me personally at jack...</i>

58:30.570 --> 58:33.106
Hey, babe. Hey, hey.

58:33.139 --> 58:35.475
- How's your arm?
- It's better. It's feeling good.

58:35.508 --> 58:37.610
- I gotta go to work. What?
- No!

58:37.644 --> 58:39.112
- Why you gotta go to work?
- Because you put me in this situation.

58:39.145 --> 58:40.346
I got to go to work
to pay the bills.

58:40.380 --> 58:42.749
Let me pay you
for the night.

58:42.782 --> 58:45.151
You can't afford me
for the night.

58:46.419 --> 58:48.588
- Listen, I love you.
- I know.

58:48.621 --> 58:50.690
I-I just want to get you guys
out of this neighborhood.

58:50.723 --> 58:53.126
Okay. Wait, wait,
call me crazy.

58:53.159 --> 58:55.361
I-I'm just throwing
this out there.

58:55.395 --> 58:57.830
I'm having second thoughts
about selling the house.

58:57.864 --> 58:59.532
- What?
- I don't know,

58:59.566 --> 59:01.568
ever since I met
the neighbor last night,

59:01.601 --> 59:04.871
- the way that he was helping me or the way that he...
- Hey, hey.

59:04.904 --> 59:08.341
- No, but maybe it's not such a bad neighborhood, babe.
- No, no, no, no, no. No!

59:08.374 --> 59:10.310
- Wait, wait. He's a nice guy.
- Baby, listen. No! That... no.

59:10.343 --> 59:12.679
He's not no fucking nice...
what did I tell you about liking people?

59:12.712 --> 59:14.781
- Liking?
- You always liking somebody.

59:14.814 --> 59:17.116
- No! Hey!
- He saved me.

59:17.150 --> 59:18.651
Relax. Let's put
this to rest

59:18.685 --> 59:20.353
until I come home
from work tonight, okay?

59:20.386 --> 59:22.155
And we can talk
about it then.

59:22.188 --> 59:24.624
- I got something I want to tell you.
- What?

59:24.657 --> 59:26.259
The next-door neighbor...

59:26.292 --> 59:27.827
- Yeah?
- He's a vampire.

59:27.860 --> 59:29.362
A vampire.

59:29.395 --> 59:30.863
- He's a fucking vampire.
- Okay.

59:30.897 --> 59:32.865
A vampire.
You're crazy.

59:32.899 --> 59:34.133
You're just jealous.

59:37.537 --> 59:40.640
Cronut, let me in.
There's a vampire living next door.

59:55.755 --> 59:57.190
Cronut?

1:00:01.728 --> 1:00:02.695
Eww.

1:00:08.901 --> 1:00:11.404
What's wrong with you?
Die, vampire!

1:00:11.437 --> 1:00:14.307
- Die, vampire! Die!
- Let me go. Let me go. Let me go!

1:00:14.340 --> 1:00:16.442
Get up off of me, man.

1:00:16.476 --> 1:00:18.344
Fuck you doing in my house all uninvited?
I didn't invite you in here.

1:00:18.378 --> 1:00:19.846
Why you sneaking up
on me like that?

1:00:19.879 --> 1:00:22.315
Why am I sneaking up on you?
This is my house!

1:00:22.348 --> 1:00:23.549
Fuck you doing
up in my house?

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:24.851
I thought you won't fuck
with me no more.

1:00:24.884 --> 1:00:26.285
Whoa.

1:00:26.319 --> 1:00:27.620
Why you got
them damn glasses on?

1:00:27.654 --> 1:00:29.188
Why you care?
You don't like 'em?

1:00:29.222 --> 1:00:30.456
They don't go
with my 'fit?

1:00:30.490 --> 1:00:32.225
- No.
- What... what you want?

1:00:32.258 --> 1:00:34.694
Shit. I, well, I just...

1:00:34.727 --> 1:00:36.496
Hey, man, look.

1:00:36.529 --> 1:00:38.231
All right.
You was right.

1:00:38.264 --> 1:00:40.700
We do have a creature
living next door to us.

1:00:40.733 --> 1:00:42.468
It's a real vampire, man.

1:00:42.502 --> 1:00:43.803
I seen his teeth!

1:00:43.836 --> 1:00:46.873
I thought you was lying
at first, but he's real.

1:00:46.906 --> 1:00:49.709
And he already got Allie,
and I don't want him to get my wife!

1:00:49.742 --> 1:00:51.511
And?

1:00:51.544 --> 1:00:54.280
And that's about the closest
to an apology you gon' get.

1:00:54.313 --> 1:00:56.249
I've been
doing my research

1:00:56.282 --> 1:00:57.884
and what I came up with?

1:00:57.917 --> 1:00:59.652
That house right over there?

1:00:59.686 --> 1:01:01.954
It's a master vampire over
there, and that's the nest.

1:01:01.988 --> 1:01:03.456
And we should kill him.

1:01:03.489 --> 1:01:05.692
- What?
- We should kill him.

1:01:05.725 --> 1:01:07.894
We, we.
That's French. We?

1:01:07.927 --> 1:01:10.797
Yes, it is we.
Ain't no I in us.

1:01:10.830 --> 1:01:14.367
It's we. Me and you.
We family.

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:16.602
Yeah.
Whatever.

1:01:16.636 --> 1:01:18.471
We should kill
that motherfucker.

1:01:18.504 --> 1:01:20.339
Let's bury him
in the ground, man.

1:01:20.373 --> 1:01:21.641
Just leave his head out

1:01:21.674 --> 1:01:23.643
and just kick him
in the head all day.

1:01:23.676 --> 1:01:25.678
Check this out.
What's my name?

1:01:25.712 --> 1:01:27.747
- Cronut.
- No, what's my real name?

1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:29.649
- Man, look, man. Stop playing.
- Mr. what?

1:01:29.682 --> 1:01:31.451
- Mister?
- Mr. Right.

1:01:31.484 --> 1:01:34.353
Mr. Right.
You want to get rid of the vampire?

1:01:34.387 --> 1:01:37.290
- Yeah.
- Trust me. I made a call.

1:01:40.493 --> 1:01:42.462
- Who is that? Is that Barack Obama?
- Trust me.

1:01:42.495 --> 1:01:44.731
Not quite,
but close.

1:01:49.569 --> 1:01:50.470
Oooh.

1:01:53.306 --> 1:01:57.643
Oh. Did you see that African
booty scratcher come out of there?

1:01:57.677 --> 1:01:58.978
- Yes.
- No!

1:01:59.011 --> 1:02:01.314
- Yes.
- Why'd you call him?

1:02:01.347 --> 1:02:02.849
- Just trust me.
- Oh, man.

1:02:02.882 --> 1:02:04.817
- Have I ever let you down?
- Yeah, a million times.

1:02:04.851 --> 1:02:06.786
Don't worry about that.
That don't count.

1:02:06.819 --> 1:02:08.955
- Oh, man. Look how he dressed.
- It looks crazy.

1:02:08.988 --> 1:02:10.590
- Don't worry about it.
- Whoopi Goldberg.

1:02:10.623 --> 1:02:12.925
- You smell a vampire?
- Not yet, wait.

1:02:12.959 --> 1:02:15.795
Right now,
I smell fear.

1:02:15.828 --> 1:02:18.898
- Fear?
- And I smell broke-ass-ness

1:02:18.931 --> 1:02:20.767
coming from this direction.

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:23.536
- Broke-ass-ness?
- No, you smell your bottom lip.

1:02:23.569 --> 1:02:25.004
Last but not least,
I smell...

1:02:27.807 --> 1:02:29.909
two bitch-ass niggas.

1:02:29.942 --> 1:02:32.612
That's why you called me to
save you like I did the Purge.

1:02:32.645 --> 1:02:34.347
Saved me? You ain't
saved me from nothin'!

1:02:34.380 --> 1:02:36.449
You better take
your Black ass off.

1:02:36.482 --> 1:02:38.551
- Punk bitch nigga, you owe me money!
- I don't owe you nothin'.

1:02:38.584 --> 1:02:40.787
You little dick bitch.
You pee on your boss.

1:02:40.820 --> 1:02:43.422
- Fuck you too.
- I hope your wife get pregnant again

1:02:43.456 --> 1:02:45.358
and I hope the baby
is not yours.

1:02:45.391 --> 1:02:46.392
You kiss my ass!

1:02:46.425 --> 1:02:47.727
Your mother,
your grandfather,

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.629
your uncles are all
the same nigga.

1:02:49.662 --> 1:02:51.397
I know you work
for that cab company.

1:02:51.430 --> 1:02:53.100
You need to get back in there
and drive that cab, so...

1:02:53.133 --> 1:02:54.767
- Carl Black, you owe me money!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:02:54.801 --> 1:02:56.769
Calm down, calm down. I got it.
I got it, calm down.

1:02:56.803 --> 1:02:58.671
- This nigga is pissing me off.
- If you calm down a little

1:02:58.704 --> 1:03:00.773
- for a second. Look...
- Don't you hit my head.

1:03:00.807 --> 1:03:02.942
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey.

1:03:02.975 --> 1:03:05.578
Look, I promised him I'd show
him some crazy spooky shit

1:03:05.611 --> 1:03:08.048
if I recorded it and put it
on his live TV show.

1:03:08.081 --> 1:03:09.682
- On YouTube?
- Yeah.

1:03:09.715 --> 1:03:10.917
- You ain't got no followers.
- He's popular.

1:03:10.950 --> 1:03:13.053
Five hundred thousand
subscribers.

1:03:13.086 --> 1:03:15.454
I got a live vampire
livin' next door to me.

1:03:15.488 --> 1:03:16.422
That's what I got.

1:03:16.455 --> 1:03:17.924
Nigga,
that's why I'm here.

1:03:17.957 --> 1:03:19.392
- That's why I brought these!
- Hey, hey!

1:03:19.425 --> 1:03:21.061
Put your leftovers down, man.

1:03:21.094 --> 1:03:24.730
You must listen to me because
I am a vampire slayer.

1:03:24.764 --> 1:03:26.766
The vampires
are very dangerous.

1:03:26.799 --> 1:03:28.801
They will kill you.

1:03:28.835 --> 1:03:32.039
He will suck your blood.
He could be after your wife.

1:03:32.072 --> 1:03:34.407
You have a wife. I know that.
I've seen her.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.043
She have a nice ass.
No disrespect.

1:03:36.076 --> 1:03:38.010
Tell me about these niggas,
please. What did he look like?

1:03:38.045 --> 1:03:40.012
He's bite-size,
he's real short.

1:03:40.047 --> 1:03:41.547
How short is he?

1:03:41.581 --> 1:03:43.516
He's short. He's... he's,
you know, he's...

1:03:43.549 --> 1:03:45.017
Between you and this nigga,
where is he?

1:03:45.052 --> 1:03:46.619
Like this way? This way?
That way? Under the table?

1:03:46.652 --> 1:03:48.387
- Pocket size.
- Pocket size nigga?

1:03:48.421 --> 1:03:49.956
He got like a little perm.

1:03:49.989 --> 1:03:52.159
He looked like that
little man on the dime.

1:03:52.192 --> 1:03:53.893
- What dime?
- The dime.

1:03:53.926 --> 1:03:55.962
- The dime, motherfucker. The dime.
- Dime. Ten cents.

1:03:55.995 --> 1:03:57.763
Ten cents a day,
like what you eat.

1:03:57.797 --> 1:03:59.765
Shut the fuck up, little bitch nigga.
Fuck you.

1:03:59.799 --> 1:04:02.435
If I had a choice
between the vampires,

1:04:02.468 --> 1:04:04.904
the devil and Donald Trump,

1:04:04.937 --> 1:04:06.973
I would take Donald Trump.

1:04:07.006 --> 1:04:10.810
The question is now he's trying
to take your family away,

1:04:10.843 --> 1:04:12.912
- what are you are gonna do?
- Hey, hey, hey!

1:04:12.945 --> 1:04:15.082
We're not the vampire.
You don't have to keep putting that on us.

1:04:15.115 --> 1:04:18.017
Don't be a bitch!
If I want to talk to a little nigga,

1:04:18.051 --> 1:04:19.652
I go to Chuck E. Cheese.

1:04:21.487 --> 1:04:23.456
Either you gon' help me,
or you gon' help me,

1:04:23.489 --> 1:04:24.724
somebody's gonna help me

1:04:24.757 --> 1:04:26.059
or I'm going up in there
with a wooden thing

1:04:26.093 --> 1:04:28.027
- and I'm gonna stab him in the...
- Mm.

1:04:28.061 --> 1:04:31.131
I'm telling you! You know how...
I'm going up in there and...

1:04:31.164 --> 1:04:32.899
Hey!

1:04:32.932 --> 1:04:34.967
- You guys are crazier'n shit!
- Who the fuck is that?

1:04:37.003 --> 1:04:39.505
Carl Black,
I'm all you have.

1:04:39.538 --> 1:04:41.674
You must save your wife

1:04:41.707 --> 1:04:43.509
<i>before it's too late.</i>

1:05:05.564 --> 1:05:06.832
<i>Fellas, listen to me.</i>

1:05:06.866 --> 1:05:09.735
The vampire is
very tricky and old.

1:05:09.769 --> 1:05:13.739
It has survived many
centuries because he's smart.

1:05:13.773 --> 1:05:17.177
Much smarter than your stupid
ignorant ass, Carl Black.

1:05:17.210 --> 1:05:20.880
That insidious bastard
is a master vampire.

1:05:20.913 --> 1:05:22.782
A master vampire?

1:05:22.815 --> 1:05:26.919
He's not to be played with.
That means he has companions.

1:05:26.953 --> 1:05:29.622
- Companions?
- We have a lot more to deal with.

1:05:29.655 --> 1:05:31.091
You have to get
to know your enemy.

1:05:31.124 --> 1:05:32.658
I thought I knew him.

1:05:32.692 --> 1:05:34.261
And how about his crew?
Do you know them?

1:05:34.294 --> 1:05:37.030
His crew? What?
The butler?

1:05:37.064 --> 1:05:40.666
Butler?! That's not a butler!
That's his ghoul!

1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:42.102
What is a ghoul?

1:05:42.135 --> 1:05:45.072
This is not the time
to be a bitch, Carl Black.

1:05:45.105 --> 1:05:47.707
A ghoul is very dangerous.

1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:49.942
- What about those fine-ass girls he had in there?
- Yeah. They was fine.

1:05:49.976 --> 1:05:52.079
- Cronut!
- I liked them.

1:05:52.112 --> 1:05:55.548
Those are not
average fine-ass girls.

1:05:55.581 --> 1:05:58.651
Those are his bodyguards.
They are murderous.

1:05:58.684 --> 1:06:00.120
What?

1:06:00.153 --> 1:06:02.655
The more beautiful they are,
the more dangerous.

1:06:02.688 --> 1:06:05.125
This is getting more serious
than I imagined.

1:06:05.158 --> 1:06:07.793
What's this shit?
It was addressed to him.

1:06:07.827 --> 1:06:09.762
He got a little chain on.
He got your same facial structure...

1:06:09.795 --> 1:06:12.132
Don't be a dick face.
Give me that.

1:06:21.707 --> 1:06:24.144
It is nothing.
Just some stupid fucking doll.

1:06:24.177 --> 1:06:25.978
- Put it away.
- Are you sure?

1:06:26.012 --> 1:06:27.546
How we going to kill
this motherfucker?

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:29.216
- Dad. Dad. I got an idea.
- What?

1:06:29.249 --> 1:06:31.650
I turned the Purge bats
into stakes.

1:06:31.684 --> 1:06:33.753
If you stab a vampire
with it, it'll die.

1:06:33.786 --> 1:06:37.090
Shut up!
This is why I'm here.

1:06:37.124 --> 1:06:40.160
We have to kill the vampire!

1:06:56.876 --> 1:06:59.712
Why you wipe my
kisses off like that?

1:06:59.745 --> 1:07:01.647
Baby, because you
put too much lip gloss on.

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:03.816
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, and then my shit

1:07:03.849 --> 1:07:05.684
- be all glittery for the rest of the day.
- Shut up. I do it for you

1:07:05.718 --> 1:07:07.620
- when I'm around you. Whatever.
- Use Chapstick.

1:07:07.653 --> 1:07:09.222
- You cute. You fine and all, baby.
- Whatever.

1:07:09.256 --> 1:07:10.823
Give me a little bit
of head now.

1:07:10.856 --> 1:07:12.024
- What?
- I'm just saying,

1:07:12.059 --> 1:07:13.893
like, I wanna get
a little bit of head...

1:07:13.926 --> 1:07:15.228
We're in front of my parents' house.
Are you serious?

1:07:15.262 --> 1:07:16.929
Baby, they're sleeping
a little bit.

1:07:16.962 --> 1:07:18.731
- Babe.
- Come on, baby.

1:07:18.764 --> 1:07:20.333
- Just a little bit of head.
- Stop playing all the time.

1:07:20.367 --> 1:07:22.601
- Baby, my-my legs. I'm-I'm paralyzed.
- Stop.

1:07:22.635 --> 1:07:25.004
That's the least you could
do, community service.

1:07:25.038 --> 1:07:26.672
Let me get a little bit
of community head.

1:07:26.705 --> 1:07:28.007
Shut up. We need to talk.

1:07:28.041 --> 1:07:29.376
Talk about what?
Baby, look,

1:07:29.409 --> 1:07:31.311
talk with my dick in
your mouth a little bit.

1:07:31.344 --> 1:07:33.012
- I don't mean to be disrespectful.
- Wait, wait. Listen.

1:07:33.046 --> 1:07:34.980
Listen to what?

1:07:35.014 --> 1:07:36.849
- Baby.
- Did you hear that?

1:07:36.882 --> 1:07:38.118
The only thing you
need to listen to is...

1:07:38.151 --> 1:07:41.154
Listen!

1:07:42.222 --> 1:07:43.356
The fuck was that?

1:07:46.093 --> 1:07:48.727
Shit! Oh, shit!

1:07:48.761 --> 1:07:50.197
- What is that?
- Ooh.

1:07:50.230 --> 1:07:51.131
Oh, my God.

1:07:53.732 --> 1:07:56.036
Freezee!
Freezee!

1:07:56.069 --> 1:07:58.138
That was Allie.

1:07:58.171 --> 1:07:59.738
Time to get the fuck out.

1:08:01.974 --> 1:08:03.143
What just happened?

1:08:03.176 --> 1:08:04.944
I don't know. I just
heard screams, man.

1:08:04.977 --> 1:08:07.713
He made the first move.
He has taken your daughter.

1:08:07.746 --> 1:08:09.416
It's all fucked up, man.

1:08:09.449 --> 1:08:11.951
I didn't know they had Allie, too.
I like Allie! But there's more.

1:08:11.984 --> 1:08:13.886
- Well, tell us more.
- Yeah, you better say something

1:08:13.919 --> 1:08:16.056
- before we take your banana bike, nigga.
- Come on now.

1:08:16.089 --> 1:08:17.990
The vampires, man,
they got me.

1:08:18.023 --> 1:08:19.792
See that house next door?

1:08:19.825 --> 1:08:23.063
They havin' a big-ass
vampire party up there, man.

1:08:23.096 --> 1:08:24.897
Dracula kind of blushin'.

1:08:24.930 --> 1:08:28.235
They said when it's over,
they gonna kill everybody.

1:08:28.268 --> 1:08:29.902
- Oh, God.
- Shit.

1:08:29.935 --> 1:08:31.737
Things all fucked up
around here, man.

1:08:31.770 --> 1:08:34.241
Not me. They ain't
gonna get me.

1:08:34.274 --> 1:08:36.143
They ain't gonna get me!

1:08:37.277 --> 1:08:38.744
Come back here!

1:08:38.777 --> 1:08:42.382
Fuck that!
I'm a real snitch!

1:08:42.415 --> 1:08:45.185
Those vampires
done bit me.

1:08:46.419 --> 1:08:47.454
Did you hear that?

1:08:47.487 --> 1:08:49.156
Yeah, you saw
how he took off?

1:08:49.189 --> 1:08:51.757
This is exactly what
the monster wants.

1:08:51.790 --> 1:08:53.126
He wants you
to attack him at night,

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.163
when he's strongest.
Don't fall for it.

1:08:56.196 --> 1:08:58.431
What am I supposed to do?
I got a wife and a daughter over there.

1:08:58.465 --> 1:09:00.766
Just wait till the daytime,
when he's weak.

1:09:00.799 --> 1:09:02.269
- And then we kill him.
- No, no, no, no.

1:09:02.302 --> 1:09:03.702
If you wait
till the morning,

1:09:03.736 --> 1:09:05.771
Lorena and Allie
will be vampires.

1:09:05.804 --> 1:09:08.241
- Oh.
- Junior, I love you to death.

1:09:08.275 --> 1:09:10.243
They already got
your sister in there.

1:09:10.277 --> 1:09:13.079
They're trying to get your mama.
This is a good neighborhood

1:09:13.113 --> 1:09:15.382
and I'm here to protect it,
because I'm Carl Black.

1:09:15.415 --> 1:09:18.285
And I'm Cronut.
We ride together, we die together!

1:09:18.318 --> 1:09:20.120
Go lock up the house.

1:09:20.153 --> 1:09:23.423
We need the right weapons
to kill this vampire.

1:09:23.456 --> 1:09:25.392
- I made a phone call.
- Who you call?

1:09:25.425 --> 1:09:27.427
- Mr. Saturday Night.
- What?

1:09:27.460 --> 1:09:29.462
He knows everything
about killing vampires.

1:09:29.496 --> 1:09:30.996
Saturday Night?

1:09:31.031 --> 1:09:33.866
I met him last Friday
at Fat Tuesday's.

1:09:33.899 --> 1:09:35.868
Let's go. It's war.

1:09:43.943 --> 1:09:46.046
Friends, let me do
all the talking.

1:09:47.846 --> 1:09:50.283
I've seen this guy
kill lots of people.

1:09:50.317 --> 1:09:52.219
Don't do
no bitch shit now.

1:10:00.493 --> 1:10:01.428
Let's go.

1:10:06.499 --> 1:10:09.236
He's the only one
to kill vampires.

1:10:09.269 --> 1:10:11.304
He'll give us
all the weapons.

1:10:12.871 --> 1:10:14.107
Just stay calm.

1:10:15.941 --> 1:10:17.843
I believe in God,
first and foremost.

1:10:17.876 --> 1:10:19.279
So we huntin' vampires.

1:10:19.312 --> 1:10:21.481
- I'm scared.
- What you scared of?

1:10:21.514 --> 1:10:22.848
He looks like
The Undertaker.

1:10:22.881 --> 1:10:24.850
I may not have what you want,

1:10:24.883 --> 1:10:26.286
but I got just what you need.

1:10:26.319 --> 1:10:27.487
Holy shit.

1:10:29.021 --> 1:10:31.124
- You ain't playin'.
- No, he's not.

1:10:31.157 --> 1:10:33.260
- Damn!
- You're gonna like this.

1:10:34.827 --> 1:10:36.329
Whoa.

1:10:36.363 --> 1:10:38.231
- Oh, that's cool. I like that.
- That's alkaline water.

1:10:38.265 --> 1:10:39.532
Alkaline? It's holy water!

1:10:39.566 --> 1:10:41.468
Joel Osteen holy water.

1:10:41.501 --> 1:10:43.203
It kind got
a pineapple taste to it.

1:10:43.236 --> 1:10:48.508
Since we have vampires,
I got us some UV sunlight.

1:10:48.541 --> 1:10:51.378
Hey, hey, hey.

1:10:53.647 --> 1:10:55.881
You're Black, motherfucker.
It don't work as well.

1:10:55.914 --> 1:10:57.417
Nigga, I can't see now.

1:10:57.450 --> 1:11:00.420
They say short motherfuckers
love to get freaky,

1:11:00.453 --> 1:11:03.556
so I brought this
just for you.

1:11:03.590 --> 1:11:05.991
My boy. You know me,
don't you?

1:11:06.025 --> 1:11:07.893
- Not really.
- Is this real leather?

1:11:07.926 --> 1:11:09.562
- Not really.
- I'm wearing this.

1:11:09.596 --> 1:11:11.531
Look at that. Look,
look, look, look.

1:11:11.564 --> 1:11:14.267
When y'all really ready to
take out some motherfuckers...

1:11:14.301 --> 1:11:15.468
Ooh.

1:11:15.502 --> 1:11:17.537
- This what I pull out.
- Shit.

1:11:17.570 --> 1:11:20.440
- God is great.
- All the time.

1:11:21.508 --> 1:11:22.975
If it ain't a Jesus.

1:11:23.008 --> 1:11:25.078
You got a calling, Carl.
You put that on.

1:11:25.111 --> 1:11:27.147
- Me?
- You put that on.

1:11:29.449 --> 1:11:31.084
God gon' protect you.

1:11:33.018 --> 1:11:34.454
There's something
I want to show you.

1:11:36.456 --> 1:11:38.558
That look like
Leslie Jones' dildo.

1:11:38.591 --> 1:11:40.493
Oh.

1:11:40.527 --> 1:11:42.495
- Nigga...
- Hey, wait, wait, man.

1:11:42.529 --> 1:11:43.862
- I think... I think he just stabbed me, he just...
- Stop it.

1:11:43.896 --> 1:11:44.997
I felt it in my...
in my body.

1:11:45.031 --> 1:11:46.599
No, you're cool.
Don't be bitches.

1:11:46.633 --> 1:11:48.601
You look like you know
what's goin' on.

1:11:48.635 --> 1:11:50.903
I know exactly
what's goin' on.

1:11:59.479 --> 1:12:01.414
Nigga, you're illuminati.
I see you.

1:12:01.448 --> 1:12:02.915
Enough of that.

1:12:03.817 --> 1:12:06.952
- Thank you, Mr. Friday the 13th.
- It's Saturday.

1:12:06.985 --> 1:12:08.388
Nigga,

1:12:08.421 --> 1:12:10.923
This nigga's... nigga!
All right, cool, cool.

1:12:10.956 --> 1:12:12.192
You keep doing your thing.

1:12:15.261 --> 1:12:17.130
<i>That nigga's
on some Harry Potter shit.</i>

1:12:17.163 --> 1:12:19.232
It's cool, really. I know the nigga.

1:13:01.374 --> 1:13:04.009
This motherfucker lit!

1:13:04.043 --> 1:13:06.479
They know
how to party here.

1:13:06.513 --> 1:13:09.149
We gotta find Allie.

1:13:09.182 --> 1:13:10.550
Damn, man,
I'm staying right here.

1:13:10.583 --> 1:13:12.419
I think I feel good
right here.

1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:23.496
Cronut!
Go that way.

1:13:35.074 --> 1:13:38.344
<i>...with three people dragging someone.</i>

1:13:38.378 --> 1:13:40.447
<i>- Neighborhood, somebody.
- Harrison.</i>

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.682
<i>- This is Harrison.
- Do you guys need a backup unit?</i>

1:13:42.715 --> 1:13:44.517
No, I'm good,
Captain. I mean,

1:13:44.551 --> 1:13:46.319
this shit making me a little
nervous for real, man.

1:13:46.352 --> 1:13:48.321
I mean, we back down
to this spooky-ass house.

1:13:48.354 --> 1:13:50.290
We just left here a
couple of days ago.

1:13:50.323 --> 1:13:52.024
Listen, I don't want
to be no cop.

1:13:52.058 --> 1:13:54.093
I just thought pieces of shit
dropped-dropped big time.

1:13:54.127 --> 1:13:55.695
Man. My man is
shitting on himself.

1:13:55.728 --> 1:13:57.530
This shit is spooky
out here, Captain.

1:13:57.564 --> 1:14:00.233
I mean, shit,
there's all kinds of noises out here

1:14:00.266 --> 1:14:02.635
and fucking some...
some wind and shit. Can y'all...

1:14:02.669 --> 1:14:04.137
I don't got the heart
for this.

1:14:04.170 --> 1:14:05.305
<i>Harrison,
is everything okay?</i>

1:14:05.338 --> 1:14:07.106
What's wrong?
You're supposed to be...

1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:09.007
You're supposed to be hard.
You're acting scared.

1:14:09.042 --> 1:14:11.110
<i>- What's wrong? Harry, what's wrong?
- Harrison.</i>

1:14:11.144 --> 1:14:13.112
I thought you had all the tricks
and now you're acting like a bitch.

1:14:13.146 --> 1:14:14.581
<i>Harrison.</i>

1:14:18.351 --> 1:14:20.420
A bite of crime
'bout to bite you, nigga.

1:14:36.636 --> 1:14:40.206
I'm not a vampire.
My name's Allie, Allie Black.

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:41.741
I live next door.

1:14:41.774 --> 1:14:45.812
If you could just get me
out of this, it would...

1:14:45.845 --> 1:14:47.614
Okay. Look, my... my...

1:14:47.647 --> 1:14:51.818
Can you ask Dr.Mama-tunday-wanday
to come here?

1:14:51.851 --> 1:14:55.355
Damn.

1:15:03.496 --> 1:15:06.099
What the fuck was that?

1:15:08.234 --> 1:15:10.403
Shut up.

1:15:12.605 --> 1:15:15.108
Don't talk.

1:15:15.141 --> 1:15:16.676
What the fuck is
your problem? Shut up.

1:15:20.547 --> 1:15:24.651
Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Hey.

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.216
- What?
- That was a silver metal nigga.

1:15:57.250 --> 1:15:59.586
Oh, God.
A silver metal nigga?

1:15:59.619 --> 1:16:01.454
Silver metal.
Not a regular nigga.

1:16:01.487 --> 1:16:02.822
Metal nigga?

1:16:02.855 --> 1:16:05.224
There are more of them niggas around.
Trust me.

1:16:08.328 --> 1:16:09.796
- Oh, shit.
- Whoo-whoo.

1:16:10.930 --> 1:16:12.365
Oh, God.

1:16:13.900 --> 1:16:15.535
Please don't hurt me.

1:16:17.403 --> 1:16:19.672
Please, Mr. knight
in big, black armor.

1:16:19.706 --> 1:16:21.341
- Oooh.
- Oh, my God.

1:16:21.374 --> 1:16:23.743
Oh, my God.

1:16:23.776 --> 1:16:27.814
- Shh.
- Mmm.

1:16:27.847 --> 1:16:29.415
- It's Cronut, baby!
- What?!

1:16:29.449 --> 1:16:31.651
- I got you, didn't I?
- Cronut... Cronut...

1:16:31.684 --> 1:16:33.252
- You didn't even know it was me, did you?
- Cronut! Get me out of here.

1:16:33.286 --> 1:16:34.787
- You gotta untie me out, please.
- Yeah.

1:16:34.821 --> 1:16:36.789
You're as fine
as a motherfucker.

1:16:36.823 --> 1:16:38.625
- When did you grow up?
- Cronut, shut... Shut the fuck up!

1:16:38.658 --> 1:16:40.560
If you like it, we second cousins,
we ain't no kin, so we can...

1:16:40.593 --> 1:16:43.196
Are you serious right now?
Shut the fuck up. I'm gonna tell Daddy.

1:16:43.229 --> 1:16:45.398
Oh, shit, man.

1:16:45.431 --> 1:16:47.867
Now I know why
the vampire wanted her.

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:51.738
Oh, hell no!
That's my baby.

1:16:52.972 --> 1:16:57.677
Baby, please wake up.
Wake up, baby. Oh...

1:16:57.710 --> 1:16:59.712
God.

1:16:59.746 --> 1:17:00.913
- Get your damn hands off! Don't touch my lady!
- Jesus, fuck.

1:17:00.947 --> 1:17:02.515
He's in there,
trying to kill us.

1:17:02.548 --> 1:17:04.250
What the fuck is you
in this shit for

1:17:04.283 --> 1:17:05.818
- in the first place?
- I was trying to escape.

1:17:05.852 --> 1:17:07.420
I was going with Freezee.

1:17:07.453 --> 1:17:08.655
That's what getting

Hurry up and get me

- What? Oh, oh!

1:17:16.396 --> 1:17:17.897
I was going with Freezee and
I don't even know where he is.

1:17:17.930 --> 1:17:19.499
Yeah, there it is,

1:17:19.532 --> 1:17:20.733

Please come back

Please, baby, I want

1:17:28.007 --> 1:17:30.643
I mean, I love you again.
I swear I love you.

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:35.548
Carl? Carl?

1:17:36.749 --> 1:17:38.484
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

1:17:38.518 --> 1:17:40.253
I had the worst dream.

1:17:40.286 --> 1:17:41.554
What did he do to you?

1:17:41.587 --> 1:17:46.292
I was, uh,
I was trying to bite you.

1:17:46.325 --> 1:17:47.894
Carl, what's in my mouth?

1:17:47.927 --> 1:17:49.262
You look like Blac Chyna.

1:17:49.295 --> 1:17:50.830
Oh, stop.
What's in my mouth?

1:17:50.863 --> 1:17:52.932
I don't know,
but I don't want no head no more.

1:17:52.965 --> 1:17:54.434
What is this, Carl?
What is this?

1:17:54.467 --> 1:17:56.536
It look like a pimple
on the mouth.

1:18:00.339 --> 1:18:01.741
Where is Daddy at?
Where is everybody?

1:18:01.774 --> 1:18:03.376
They right here looking

1:18:03.409 --> 1:18:04.544
But how we gonna get them?

1:18:04.577 --> 1:18:05.678
All right. This is
what we're gonna do.

1:18:05.712 --> 1:18:07.613
All right.
This me, this you.

1:18:07.647 --> 1:18:09.248
- When I'm gonna say "hike," you're gonna throw the ball...
- Right.

1:18:09.282 --> 1:18:10.717
Nah, I don't like that play.

1:18:10.750 --> 1:18:12.919
This is what we gon'
do, ten yards cut...

1:18:12.952 --> 1:18:14.821
- Are you playing football?
- You-you want to get out of here or not?

1:18:14.854 --> 1:18:16.789
- It doesn't work! Shut the fuck up.
- Just let's go.

1:18:28.367 --> 1:18:30.803
- No.

1:18:30.837 --> 1:18:32.305
Don't you do

1:18:32.338 --> 1:18:33.873
Calm down.

1:18:36.476 --> 1:18:38.311
- Calm the fuck down.
- Please, please.

1:18:40.513 --> 1:18:44.317
No! Cronut, no!

1:18:44.350 --> 1:18:45.852
Please.

1:18:52.425 --> 1:18:55.361
Don't you do it,
don't you do it.

1:18:55.394 --> 1:18:57.864
No...

1:19:00.900 --> 1:19:02.502
Mayweather.

1:19:02.535 --> 1:19:03.636
He gave it like that.

1:19:05.638 --> 1:19:07.507
Yeah!

1:19:19.786 --> 1:19:23.056
I'm a vampire slayer.
I'm like Blade.

1:19:23.090 --> 1:19:24.557
- I did that.
- You did what?

1:19:24.590 --> 1:19:26.559
- I killed him.
- No, I did that. I did...

1:19:26.592 --> 1:19:27.894
- Really?
- I'm Blade. Yeah, yeah.

1:19:30.663 --> 1:19:32.465
Let's go find your dad.

1:19:32.498 --> 1:19:34.967
Carl, I don't feel well.
Tell me, where are we?

1:19:35.001 --> 1:19:36.335
<i>Lorena?</i>

There he is!

1:19:38.704 --> 1:19:39.705
Carl Black.

1:19:40.773 --> 1:19:42.975
Release my beloved.

1:19:43.009 --> 1:19:44.710
That's the nigga

You don't mess

1:19:46.746 --> 1:19:48.381
That is our wife.

1:19:48.414 --> 1:19:50.583
She is at least
on a time share.

1:19:50.616 --> 1:19:52.785

You will no longer

1:20:10.570 --> 1:20:11.771
Hit him

1:20:15.842 --> 1:20:18.778
Hit him again. Damn,

1:20:18.811 --> 1:20:21.013
Man, that's mango juice

1:20:21.048 --> 1:20:22.648
Why this nigga

1:20:22.682 --> 1:20:24.750
- Why?
- Oh, man. That's bullshit.

1:20:24.784 --> 1:20:26.485
- What kind of nigga is this?
- Fuck you're gonna kill a vampire

1:20:26.519 --> 1:20:28.788

1:20:28.821 --> 1:20:29.922
Hit him

1:20:29.956 --> 1:20:31.390
Punk bitch, die!

1:20:32.925 --> 1:20:35.394
This nigga is not dying.
Back up.

Thank you, ladies.

1:20:37.130 --> 1:20:38.865

<i>Enough!</i>

1:20:47.006 --> 1:20:49.675
Look how you got my

Denmark and Dayton.

1:21:02.922 --> 1:21:04.423
That's Jodeci!

1:21:08.061 --> 1:21:09.829
No!

1:21:10.897 --> 1:21:14.533
I swear by the black hairs

I will huff and puff

1:21:16.936 --> 1:21:20.706
<i>and these
demons will blow your house down.</i>

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:22.642
What's up, y'all?

1:21:22.675 --> 1:21:25.212
- Watch out... oh!

What the hell are you

Freezee,

1:21:28.181 --> 1:21:29.649

1:21:29.682 --> 1:21:32.518
Vampire gang.
We out here, gang-gang!

1:21:32.551 --> 1:21:34.087
They done hooked your boy up.

1:21:34.121 --> 1:21:38.624
Half vampire, half goat
legs, full horse dick.

1:21:38.658 --> 1:21:40.626
Donkey dick.

1:21:42.062 --> 1:21:43.863
It's all backwards,
though.

1:21:43.896 --> 1:21:45.698
Your ass
is forward, Freezee.

1:21:45.731 --> 1:21:47.067
They done fuck me up
in the lab.

1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:49.735
You're a hairy
retarded vampire.

1:21:49.769 --> 1:21:51.537
- This ain't the life I chose.
- You fucked him up.

1:21:51.570 --> 1:21:53.606
You fucked him up.
You fucked him up.

1:21:53.639 --> 1:21:55.574
I appreciate it.
At least I can walk now.

1:21:55.608 --> 1:21:58.178
Listen here,
Switchblade.

1:21:58.211 --> 1:22:01.181
You already know
Black Lives Matter.

1:22:01.214 --> 1:22:05.218
This is Black matter lives.

1:22:06.686 --> 1:22:08.654
Welcome to the dark,
motherfucker.

1:22:08.688 --> 1:22:10.556
<i>Attack!</i>

1:22:10.589 --> 1:22:11.624
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1:22:43.656 --> 1:22:45.558
- You hit me in the nuts!
- I'm sorry.

1:22:46.726 --> 1:22:48.228
I'm tired of your ass.

1:22:52.965 --> 1:22:55.001
Let's go, bitch.
Let's go.

1:23:01.874 --> 1:23:03.576
I got you!

1:23:11.118 --> 1:23:14.854

1:23:14.887 --> 1:23:16.589
Carl!
Behind you!

1:23:28.135 --> 1:23:29.036
Help her.

1:23:34.107 --> 1:23:37.277
- I can't move my hand.
- I can't move mine.

1:23:37.310 --> 1:23:39.612
I'm throwing up
gang signs.

1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:50.090
Finally, Lorena.

1:24:21.354 --> 1:24:24.757
Nigga is not dead yet.
I don't think he's dead.

1:24:34.667 --> 1:24:36.036
Baby, he's not dead.

1:24:39.172 --> 1:24:43.676
<i>You know I'm coming now.</i>

1:24:45.911 --> 1:24:48.248
Go get the voodoo doll.
It's the only way to kill him.

1:24:48.281 --> 1:24:50.616
- All right. Cool.
- Hurry.

1:24:55.754 --> 1:24:57.290
Go lock the back door.

1:24:57.324 --> 1:24:58.724
Get the doors locked.
Come on.

1:24:58.757 --> 1:24:59.925
We can't kill him
without the voodoo doll!

1:25:02.262 --> 1:25:04.264
Cronut, hurry up.
Hurry.

1:25:05.831 --> 1:25:07.300
Hurry up, Cronut.

1:25:09.169 --> 1:25:11.371
Wooky said this
will kill the vampire.

1:25:11.404 --> 1:25:12.905
Is that it?

1:25:12.938 --> 1:25:14.274
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

1:25:16.309 --> 1:25:17.710
Whoa! Shit!

1:25:19.246 --> 1:25:21.081
Ah, shit!

1:25:23.316 --> 1:25:26.018
Come on, come on. Oh, shit!

1:25:26.052 --> 1:25:27.987
- Please. Please.
- Hey, hey, stop.

1:25:28.020 --> 1:25:30.423
Please.

1:25:32.192 --> 1:25:34.427
Shit!

1:25:54.281 --> 1:25:55.814
<i>Lorena.</i>

1:25:57.284 --> 1:25:59.952
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

1:25:59.985 --> 1:26:02.055
- Carl...
- What's wrong?

1:26:02.088 --> 1:26:03.789
He's calling me.

1:26:06.992 --> 1:26:08.961
<i>You can kill me,</i>

1:26:08.994 --> 1:26:12.065
<i>but you cannot make me die.</i>

1:26:22.042 --> 1:26:25.010
<i>I will have what belongs to me.</i>

1:26:34.521 --> 1:26:36.755
I'm 'bout to go kill
Mamuwalde.

1:26:36.789 --> 1:26:38.325
Okay.

1:26:42.828 --> 1:26:44.331
Damn, Hugo.

1:26:44.364 --> 1:26:45.898
Nobody calls me Hugo.

1:26:47.033 --> 1:26:48.368
What do they call you then?

1:26:48.401 --> 1:26:50.803
<i>Filero.</i>

1:26:50.836 --> 1:26:53.106
<i>And what's Filero?</i>

1:26:53.139 --> 1:26:56.243
It means blade
in Mexican.

1:26:59.346 --> 1:27:00.913
Really?

1:27:14.860 --> 1:27:16.396
Carl... no...

1:27:18.231 --> 1:27:20.567
<i>Where
do you think you're going?</i>

1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:22.369
What did you just do
to me?

1:27:22.402 --> 1:27:24.070
<i>Do you feel that?</i>

1:27:25.438 --> 1:27:26.905
I got the voodoo doll.

1:27:26.939 --> 1:27:29.476
Break the voodoo doll.

1:27:29.509 --> 1:27:31.877
- What?
- Break the voodoo doll!

1:27:33.012 --> 1:27:34.080
Cronut!

1:27:34.114 --> 1:27:36.283
<i>Release your meaningless life.</i>

1:27:36.316 --> 1:27:38.451
Fuck out that...

1:27:38.485 --> 1:27:40.853
<i>I see we don't know what immortal means.</i>

1:27:40.886 --> 1:27:43.356
Break the doll, the voodoo doll.

1:27:45.225 --> 1:27:46.526
- Break it!
- Break it!

1:28:01.107 --> 1:28:04.077
<i>- You motherfucker.
- Don't you touch me.</i>

1:28:08.448 --> 1:28:10.517
<i>Come to me, Lorena.</i>

1:28:11.284 --> 1:28:14.421
<i>- You better stop!
- Come this way.</i>

1:28:14.454 --> 1:28:16.855
Lorena, wake up!

1:28:16.889 --> 1:28:18.358
<i>Lorena.</i>

1:28:19.958 --> 1:28:22.429
<i>Take your place with me.</i>

1:28:22.462 --> 1:28:24.264
Babe, don't do
this! Baby!

1:28:24.297 --> 1:28:28.967
<i>We are the Jay-Z and Beyoncé
of the underworld.</i>

1:28:30.670 --> 1:28:34.441
<i>Complete my darkness.</i>

1:28:34.474 --> 1:28:37.644
<i>Come with me.
There's not much time left.</i>

1:28:49.955 --> 1:28:52.258
<i>You don't need him.</i>

1:28:52.292 --> 1:28:56.028
<i>He doesn't have a job
and he can't write a book.</i>

1:29:06.706 --> 1:29:09.409
<i>I got this new book
coming out. Terror Night.</i>

1:29:09.442 --> 1:29:11.111
Nigga! Ain't nobody
reading your book!

1:29:11.144 --> 1:29:13.912
My book is in... in... in
Barnes and Noble's.

1:29:13.946 --> 1:29:16.416
<i>That book was terrible.
It's one of the worst books I ever read.</i>

1:29:16.449 --> 1:29:18.016
Carl, I'm not happy here.

1:29:18.051 --> 1:29:19.419
I need the money, Dad.

1:29:19.452 --> 1:29:21.287
Just... just leave.
Just leave. Go take a nap.

1:29:21.321 --> 1:29:22.921
This ain't the time
for your goddamn book.

1:29:24.057 --> 1:29:25.658
I don't know
if this is it for us.

1:29:25.692 --> 1:29:28.561
I used to think it was the house,
the neighborhood, your book.

1:29:31.398 --> 1:29:33.099
<i>You need to realize
that family's</i>

1:29:33.133 --> 1:29:34.567
<i>the most important thing
in life, not a book.</i>

1:29:36.102 --> 1:29:37.137
- I'm moving out.
- You're messing up.

1:29:39.172 --> 1:29:42.007
It's you and I that don't work.
It's you.

1:29:45.178 --> 1:29:47.447
<i>Come to me now.</i>

1:29:52.218 --> 1:29:53.986
Carl Black,
save your wife.

1:30:09.202 --> 1:30:13.239
Global warming is real.

1:30:30.757 --> 1:30:34.327
Jack Mihoff,
ANN News Live with the Buzz.

1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:36.629
So you've survived the Purge.

1:30:36.663 --> 1:30:40.166
You and this ragtag
band of pimps, hoes...

1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:41.534
- No, that's my family.
- Sorry, what?!

1:30:41.568 --> 1:30:43.203
No. It wasn't no pimps
and hoes over here.

1:30:43.236 --> 1:30:45.003
You defeated the vampire.

1:30:45.038 --> 1:30:47.173
Saved the whole
entire neighborhood.

1:30:47.207 --> 1:30:50.410
Have you, Black Panther,
Chloe, and Bow-Wow

1:30:50.443 --> 1:30:54.012
ever thought about becoming
the new Black Ghostbusters?

1:30:57.183 --> 1:30:59.786
- Hunting ghosts?
- Hunting ghosts? I mean...

1:30:59.819 --> 1:31:01.287
You don't have
to answer that, Carl.

1:31:01.321 --> 1:31:03.189
It's a good idea.
We could make money.

1:31:03.223 --> 1:31:04.491
Let's wait,
let's wait.

1:31:04.524 --> 1:31:06.726
Don't be a bitch.
Let's make this money, Carl.

1:31:06.759 --> 1:31:09.362
Yes. Don't be a bitch.
Make the money.

1:31:09.395 --> 1:31:11.164
And what the fuck
did you do?

1:31:11.197 --> 1:31:12.732
- Look at me.
- We could make money, Carl.

1:31:12.765 --> 1:31:15.034
- Get the money, Carl.
- Carl, let's do it.

1:31:15.068 --> 1:31:17.070
- I'm gonna make money.
- Yeah. Why-why not?

1:31:17.103 --> 1:31:18.671
One more question.
Handicapped white man,

1:31:18.705 --> 1:31:21.741
is it true that your first
experience with vampires

1:31:21.774 --> 1:31:25.345
was in the jungle in Hanoi
where your troop was ambushed,

1:31:25.378 --> 1:31:29.782
you were ravaged,
and your legs were completely destroyed?

1:31:29.816 --> 1:31:32.185
Fuck you, Sammy Sosa.

1:31:32.218 --> 1:31:33.720
One thing I hate
about this neighborhood...

1:31:33.753 --> 1:31:35.588
all the goddamn vampires.

1:31:35.622 --> 1:31:38.591
Well, we would just
like to thank you

1:31:38.625 --> 1:31:40.793
for your service
to this country and make...

1:31:40.827 --> 1:31:42.395
Oh, my Lord!

1:31:42.428 --> 1:31:43.763
His hands are strong,
but his legs are dead.

1:31:43.796 --> 1:31:45.532
Come on. Come on.
Let his hand. Let his hand.

1:31:45.565 --> 1:31:47.400
Get off me, Carl!
Your wife's cheating on you!

1:31:47.433 --> 1:31:48.635
- What are you talking about?
- What?

1:31:48.668 --> 1:31:49.802
- I see everything!
- Shut up!

1:31:49.836 --> 1:31:51.771
- Cronut's gay.
- No, I'm not.

1:31:51.804 --> 1:31:53.139
That don't count in jail.

1:31:53.172 --> 1:31:54.340
That's not even
your daughter!

1:31:54.374 --> 1:31:56.743
- Uh-uh.
- No. I'm sick of this.

1:31:56.776 --> 1:31:58.778
Yeah. I'm sick of you.

1:31:58.811 --> 1:32:01.047
Come on, Carl.

1:32:03.816 --> 1:32:05.552
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1:32:05.585 --> 1:32:07.787
<i>Give me one second,
baby. I'm coming.</i>

1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:09.455
Lord knows I'm coming.

1:32:09.489 --> 1:32:12.792
I know you happy you ain't
with Clive no more.

1:32:12.825 --> 1:32:15.261
- But what's taking you so long?
- You're rushing me, babe.

1:32:15.295 --> 1:32:17.630
You ain't rush Clive.
I know you waited for his ass.

1:32:17.664 --> 1:32:20.300
Just calm down.
You gon' get this dick.

1:32:20.333 --> 1:32:22.101
Gonna drop some
good dick on you.

1:32:22.135 --> 1:32:23.603
Well, hurry.

1:32:23.636 --> 1:32:25.338
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:32:25.371 --> 1:32:27.473
Yeah.

1:32:27.507 --> 1:32:32.445
You see it.
You see it. Yeah.

1:32:32.478 --> 1:32:34.547
Say you're ready for me
to draw some dick O's.

1:32:37.450 --> 1:32:40.186
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Oh-oh.</i>

1:32:40.219 --> 1:32:42.255
<i>That's it?</i>

1:32:42.288 --> 1:32:44.257
<i>You're kidding.</i>

1:32:44.290 --> 1:32:46.826
Wait. I-I...
damn, this was a long song.

1:32:46.859 --> 1:32:48.361
- Wow.
- You did good. No, no, no.

1:32:48.394 --> 1:32:50.363
What you wowing for?

1:32:51.931 --> 1:32:55.868
<i>Who knocked it down, nigga?</i>

1:32:55.902 --> 1:32:58.171
<i>Bitch ass!</i>

1:34:25.658 --> 1:34:30.430
<i>This is Jack Mihoff
with today's latest buzz.</i>

1:34:30.463 --> 1:34:33.633
<i>There has been reports
of a ragtag band</i>

1:34:33.666 --> 1:34:37.870
<i>of Negro thug

<i>Reports have been stated that
