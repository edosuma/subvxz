WEBVTT

00:06.528 --> 00:09.096
- Previously
on "Deadly Class..."

00:10.271 --> 00:10.445
My old roommate
has Chico's body.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.099
- If you don't find me
in three days,

00:13.404 --> 00:14.623
this psycho's going to
send me home with a note.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.103
- There has to be
a better way.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.713
- There isn't.
- Jimmy Jon,

00:17.756 --> 00:19.889
show this gimp a little
hillbilly how-do.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.761
- Oh!
- Holy shit!

00:22.805 --> 00:25.286
- You bring in a ringer.
You cheated.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.289
- This how you usually do it?
- I don't do this with anyone.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.162
Damn it.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.643
- You act like
you have no control.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.385
- Hello, brother.
- The Guild will find her.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.561
- You have to figure out
how to handle Maria.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.519
- That's not the reason
why you're mad at me, is it?

00:46.307 --> 00:47.917
- Kuroki wanted Chico
out of business.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.397
Yukio, he's got to go.

01:08.459 --> 01:12.420
- Does Marcus know you took it?
- No, ma'am.

01:12.463 --> 01:13.943
- How did you get it?

01:13.986 --> 01:16.467
- I go through his stuff
when he's not in the room.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.133
- Return it where you found it.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.355
Track every move he makes.

01:53.722 --> 01:56.986
- So it makes sense that every
post-apocalyptic future movie

01:57.029 --> 01:58.553
is full of punk rockers.

01:58.596 --> 02:00.207
They're the ones
that survive because

02:00.250 --> 02:02.296
they've been
anticipating it the whole time.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.864
It's kind of ironic.
The only ones

02:05.908 --> 02:07.475
who saw how
shitty the world was

02:07.518 --> 02:08.867
are the ones
stuck living in it.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.652
- Is that where you see
yourself in the future?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.306
- Yes.
- It sounds sad.

02:12.349 --> 02:15.396
- Boardwalk with a hotel.
Pay me two grand, busta.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.354
- Fuckin' "Monopoly."

02:17.398 --> 02:19.791
This is proof that capitalism
doesn't work, okay?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.576
Because whoever else
gets property first,

02:21.619 --> 02:24.318
they get to screw with
everyone else in the game.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.015
- Oy, oy!

02:26.058 --> 02:27.886
Whereas I'm chuffed.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.237
An absolute fan
of the status quo,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.977
because it sure is smashing
for the chaps up top.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.329
- Did you see that, Petra?
I landed it.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.853
- Better than Lex's
sketchy bomb drop.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.463
- My bomb drop's
more impressive

02:39.507 --> 02:41.030
than your imminent
middle-age boob drop.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.553
I mean, they're fine now,

02:42.597 --> 02:44.338
but look at those
pointy little puffers.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.862
No elasticity.
Gravity's your enemy,

02:46.905 --> 02:49.517
my melancholy mime.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.432
- Don't start
on me, Buttermilk.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.435
- We're on the same side.
Rap, punk--

02:54.478 --> 02:56.872
poor kids making music
about their circumstances.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.875
- So you think it's about
rich and poor?

02:59.918 --> 03:01.703
You ain't been
in America long enough.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.357
- It's totally true.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.054
I just wonder if things
will ever get better.

03:05.097 --> 03:08.318
- Thinking about the future
is a luxury for rich kids.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.887
- I just get through the day.
- Yeah, we were all sort of

03:11.930 --> 03:13.845
expecting that
from you, Morrissey.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.067
- Come on, Billy.
You got to have some goal.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.026
Just one thing
you want to be great at.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.593
- Can't make it
to the top of the ladder

03:22.637 --> 03:25.596
unless you're a sociopath.
- Why's that?

03:25.640 --> 03:26.858
- Because the ladder's
made of humans.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.518
- Got a minute?

03:41.395 --> 03:42.874
- What is it?

03:42.918 --> 03:44.833
- Someone killed
one of my crew last night.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.619
It has to be Fuckface.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.100
- That's impossible.
How would he even know--

03:51.143 --> 03:53.276
- How does he know anything
about any of us?

03:55.104 --> 03:57.976
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.370
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt

04:00.414 --> 04:02.633
a quality moment
with you and my boyfriend.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.767
- I was just giving him
some archery tips.

04:05.810 --> 04:08.422
Like "duck."

04:12.991 --> 04:15.342
- I have to talk to you.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.653
- What's going on?

04:22.697 --> 04:24.786
- Yukio was murdered
last night.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.658
- Ah, what the fuck
is going on around here?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.834
You okay?
- I'm fine.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.662
But when I find out
who did it--

04:31.706 --> 04:33.055
- Fine?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.798
You don't always got to
keep the guard up, Saya.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.713
- Coming from you?

04:38.756 --> 04:41.019
When was the last time you said
an honest thing to anyone?

04:50.986 --> 04:54.598
- I killed Yukio.
- What?

04:57.862 --> 05:02.127
- El Diablo thinks
his son's been avenged.

05:02.171 --> 05:05.522
Be happy!
I took care of our problem.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.784
- You killed someone!

05:12.137 --> 05:14.183
Maria, use your head.

05:14.226 --> 05:18.187
If--if Diablo thinks
a Kuroki murdered his son,

05:18.230 --> 05:21.538
you think he'll be satisfied
with you killing a henchman?

05:21.582 --> 05:25.542
He'll want a person at the top.
He'll want Saya.

05:34.246 --> 05:37.206
- Did I tell you about
this Yukio situation?

05:37.249 --> 05:41.036
That Guild lady
is really ticked off.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.432
Hey, hey, did we get a new dog?

05:45.475 --> 05:48.696
Hello, Mom, Mom?

05:48.739 --> 05:51.133
- Heard Yukio got himself
diced up like a sushi.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.004
- Oh, I assumed
that was your people.

05:53.048 --> 05:56.834
- Nope, but whoever done it,
there's going to be trouble.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.620
- Everyone's saying
it was the Vatos.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.231
- Bullshit, no way.

06:02.274 --> 06:06.670
- Maria's played you.
Open your eyes.

06:06.714 --> 06:09.760
Yukio's death
makes us vulnerable.

06:09.804 --> 06:13.111
- Saya, hey.
- I'm late for class.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.246
- I have to talk to you.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.943
Alone.

06:23.078 --> 06:27.212
- You know what, Maria?
It's all a bit much with you.

06:29.084 --> 06:32.087
You're going to be mad,
but you have to listen to me.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.576
- You tried to distract me.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.013
- Saya, you know
I would never--

06:45.056 --> 06:46.623
- Never what?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.538
You shot a fucking arrow
at us, Maria, you bitch.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.714
- And what were you
doing that night?

06:50.758 --> 06:52.716
- Wait, stop!

06:52.760 --> 06:54.892
- Fight's over.
- Hey, god damn it!

06:54.936 --> 06:56.590
- Back to your rooms.
- My bag!

06:56.633 --> 06:58.679
- Move. Move! Move!
- Stop pushing!.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.942
- Move, now.
- Dude!

07:00.985 --> 07:03.988
- To your rooms!
- Hey, this isn't my room!

07:04.032 --> 07:06.077
- Get the fuck off me.
- Move!

07:06.121 --> 07:08.123
- Saya!

07:08.166 --> 07:09.994
I have to tell you something.
- Move!

07:10.038 --> 07:11.213
- It's not what you think!

07:11.256 --> 07:12.823
- To your room.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.173
- No, no, no, no, no!

07:18.307 --> 07:20.135
- Move, move.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.967
- Another student is dead.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.144
And I will find out
who's responsible.

07:29.187 --> 07:32.277
You're all on lockdown
until I do.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.992
- Well, ain't this cozy?

08:11.142 --> 08:12.796
- I don't speak Mexican,

08:12.840 --> 08:16.060
but "Saya" sounds the same
in both languages.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.236
- I need to talk to Lin.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.856
- It's jammed from the outside.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.902
- Your gypsy street tricks

09:14.945 --> 09:18.035
will not work on lockdown,
gutter boy.

09:18.079 --> 09:22.213
- I told Gabrielle
I was on my way over.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.694
Now, she's going to think
I stood her up.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.218
- Why do you have flowers?
Is girl dead?

09:27.262 --> 09:29.830
Did you over-correct
her behavior?

09:29.873 --> 09:32.920
- What?
No, step off, Vlad.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.400
- Fuck.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.707
Shabnam's bed is lumpy
like him.

09:44.279 --> 09:47.108
Is old proverb.

09:47.151 --> 09:51.373
To abuse one's horkum
is to anger the Baba Yaga.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.114
- I got to send
a message to Saya

09:53.157 --> 09:55.290
before her and Maria
kill each other.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.380
Come on.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.434
Stupidity's spreading
like a virus.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.307
Rampant, unchecked idiocy.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.962
- Well, I'm sure society
will course correct.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.920
Maybe if we legalize
model glue.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.792
- The system's rigged
to prevent it.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.403
Paint by numbers music,

10:21.446 --> 10:23.318
soulless cinema
dumbing us down.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.320
A bloody thespian
has the nuclear codes!

10:26.887 --> 10:29.933
Oh, nitwits have taken over.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.719
- It's too easy to say
everyone's stupid.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.416
The world's full
of great things.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.767
- A small percentage of useful
people do cool shit, sure.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.987
But the unwashed masses?
It's--

10:40.030 --> 10:43.338
- We have so much in common.
Why do we bicker?

10:43.381 --> 10:45.035
- You have a crush on me.
- Ha!

10:45.079 --> 10:47.168
You've got me mixed up
with Sad Sack Sammy here.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.522
- It's kind of nice
being locked in together.

10:53.565 --> 10:56.525
- ♪ Eyes, dark, grey lens,
frightened of the sun ♪

10:56.568 --> 10:59.484
♪ We would have a fine time
living in the night ♪

10:59.528 --> 11:01.356
♪ Left to blind destruction

11:01.399 --> 11:03.401
- She's not bloody interested!

11:03.445 --> 11:06.535
Especially as she's seeing you
next to a real charming bloke.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.059
What do you say?
Fancy a go?

11:10.191 --> 11:12.976
- Pass.
- Come on, love.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.892
I'm smarmy, handsome,
and abusive.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.373
I'm every girl's dream.
- You're the kind of dirt bag

11:18.416 --> 11:20.375
art school girls
date for legitimacy.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.899
- Exactly, your type.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.950
- You didn't
have my back with Juan.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.821
- How are the Kurokis
supposed to protect you

11:31.865 --> 11:33.910
when you're always
hanging out with those Rats?

11:33.954 --> 11:35.390
And Maria.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.392
You two are practically
attached at the hip.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.874
- Actually, I think they've
been a little distant lately.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.397
There must have been
a falling out.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.966
- Yukio's murdered,
and you do nothing.

11:46.009 --> 11:49.970
You've gone soft.
Our entire clan looks weak.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.539
- It's my family,
it's my problem.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.542
- If you do not achieve
valedictorian, we all suffer.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.067
- Perhaps I can offer
my negotiating skills.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.940
My parents assisted the Shah
of Iran before the fall.

12:03.984 --> 12:07.465
- Thanks, but I'm no longer
forming outside alliances.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.251
I will deal with this.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.778
Juan's a dead man.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.831
- It's a long, slow punishment.

12:24.874 --> 12:29.400
Skin torn back, ribs bare.

12:29.444 --> 12:33.143
Heart exposed.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.579
- How long can the human body

12:34.623 --> 12:36.277
withstand getting
stripped away?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.888
- It's not about the body...

12:38.932 --> 12:42.370
both: But the mind.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.981
- Father was fond
of that lesson.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.075
- And what of
your mind, brother?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.514
- That's my burden.

12:58.647 --> 13:02.433
- Your burdens do not belong
to you alone.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.653
Seeing Nahia made me realize

13:04.696 --> 13:07.003
I was wrong
to be angry with you.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.355
I know the weight
of that choice.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.972
But if you do not find out

13:19.015 --> 13:22.149
what happened to Yukio
and to Chico,

13:22.192 --> 13:24.629
the Guild will descend on us.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.545
I'll have to take
your daughter.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.202
To protect her.

13:34.335 --> 13:39.340
Luckily, it will not
come to that.

14:02.972 --> 14:03.930
- I thought you were done
huffing glue.

14:05.061 --> 14:05.453
- Oh, I'm not giving up
on my recovery.

14:06.410 --> 14:06.976
Just consciously
slipping a bit.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.849
- Your parents
must be so proud.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.633
- I can assure you,
whatever pride

14:11.676 --> 14:13.765
my father had in me
is long gone.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.556
So the dockworker
doesn't approve

14:21.599 --> 14:23.036
of Lin's curriculum?

14:23.079 --> 14:24.602
- He doesn't know where I am.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.477
And he's not just a dockworker.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.222
He's a fucking hero.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.877
Mum left me
when I was just a lad,

14:37.920 --> 14:41.924
stranded my Dad with
three lunatic boys.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.536
He was the only honest man
on the Tilbury docks.

14:47.538 --> 14:51.238
- You got the goods, Lexie.
Real heart.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.632
Please don't be a wanker
like your brothers.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.243
- I acted like a saint
around him

14:56.286 --> 14:59.246
but like an animal
around my brothers.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.553
They were rotten,
he was right.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.207
But they were
the only ones around.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.948
They raised me.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.777
All I wanted to do
was impress them.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.170
I used my dad's security card

15:10.213 --> 15:12.215
to get into
the shipping containers.

15:12.259 --> 15:15.044
Hawked the boosted goods
out on the street.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.699
We were immortal.

15:17.742 --> 15:21.964
Until one night,
shit went tits up.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.101
- I thought the hardest part
was going to be

15:28.144 --> 15:30.103
dealing with the guilt.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.756
But the old Bill found

15:31.800 --> 15:33.541
my dad's security card
on the site.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.064
I'd dropped it.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.069
- Thought you'd get away
with it?

15:43.681 --> 15:48.643
My dad lied, probably
the first time in his life.

15:48.686 --> 15:52.995
He told the coppers he was
the thief and the shooter.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.606
Now, he's serving my time.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.961
Ruined his life...

16:02.004 --> 16:03.919
for me.

16:07.357 --> 16:11.057
I came to San Francisco
to get as far away as possible.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.797
Was living on the streets

16:12.841 --> 16:14.799
until Saya found me
and brought me to King's.

16:14.843 --> 16:19.021
- What about your dad?
- We don't talk much.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.157
Fuck!

16:24.200 --> 16:28.161
Got me blubbing
like Tammy Faye Bakker.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.865
A sad tale, yeah.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.043
Must get those
maternal instincts going.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.045
Care to let me suckle a teat?

16:43.089 --> 16:45.134
- Don't you mean
"pointy puffers?"

16:45.178 --> 16:46.353
- A term of endearment.
I like pointy.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.876
- It's weird
that she's not into

16:47.919 --> 16:49.312
the whole
misogynistic pig routine.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.879
- Well, you're certainly
the authority

16:50.922 --> 16:54.056
of what she's not into, mate.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.189
- Stop, stop!

17:05.111 --> 17:06.286
You're both in love
with me, right?

17:06.329 --> 17:07.330
- Yes.
- Well, I didn't

17:07.374 --> 17:09.767
say "love," love.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.248
- Let me rephrase.

17:12.292 --> 17:16.774
Both of you
want to have sex with me.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.907
Well, it's not about
what you want.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.084
It's about what I want.

17:22.128 --> 17:25.392
I'm young, right?
I'm--I'm at my peak.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.046
I mean, my future is
I'm either dead

17:27.089 --> 17:29.178
or wrinkled up and old,
and I want to

17:29.222 --> 17:32.790
try everything at least once
before my pointy puffers sag.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.010
So...

17:35.054 --> 17:37.752
let's check one off my list,
big mouths.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.235
You guys want to have
a threesome?

17:46.804 --> 17:47.979
- If we're going to be
stuck in here,

17:48.023 --> 17:50.112
you don't get to dictate
the music.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.115
Got to get with
the times, Arguello.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.247
- "Get with the times?"
Doesn't that mean just

17:54.290 --> 17:55.422
copy what some other people

17:55.465 --> 17:57.380
decided we should
like recently?

17:57.424 --> 18:00.992
- You hate the mainstream
because everyone can enjoy it.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.995
- I guess that's how someone
like you would boil it down.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.954
Spoon fed art, film, and music

18:05.997 --> 18:08.435
by whatever corporate facility
decided you should have it.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.915
- You are just
desperate for people

18:10.959 --> 18:12.265
to think you are unique.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.136
- You're a
vanilla person, okay?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
So you go ahead and enjoy
whatever vanilla shit

18:16.182 --> 18:17.922
you're served
and told to ingest.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.447
You're boring.
- Is Bon Jovi vanilla?

18:20.490 --> 18:24.015
Of course not.
- You're a narcissist, yo.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.017
- Because I have an opinion
about music?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.976
- No, because nobody else
gets to have one.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.935
- You're just mad about before,
that I'm more worried about

18:30.979 --> 18:32.198
this gang war
brewing up than you

18:32.241 --> 18:33.286
scuffling with
your new girlfriend.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.027
- See, that's it, right there.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.204
You take me to Vegas
under false pretenses,

18:38.247 --> 18:40.423
got me involved in
a dangerous situation,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.469
and then you lie
about everything.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.166
- This isn't about you, man--

18:44.210 --> 18:46.908
- When is it about me, Marcus?
Huh?

19:00.878 --> 19:03.229
Hope I'm not
speaking out of turn.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.928
- Your lips are moving,
so one can assume.

19:08.364 --> 19:11.846
People who get close
to you, Maria, well,

19:11.889 --> 19:14.979
it seems like nothing good's
been happening to them.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.459
Chico, Saya--

19:16.503 --> 19:18.331
- I had nothing
to do with that.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.333
- Old Juan-y might have
swung the blade,

19:20.376 --> 19:22.204
but you're his leader.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.511
Saya's going to
have to retaliate.

19:24.554 --> 19:30.169
Second those doors open,
you're target numero uno.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.432
- She's not like that.
- No?

19:37.263 --> 19:40.788
Because the Saya
I know is reel keen

19:40.831 --> 19:44.966
on retaliating against anyone
who tries to kill her.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.838
- White girl's right.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.101
You got to do something
before Saya does.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.205
- I'm getting word out
to the other Soto Vatos.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.032
We are at war.

20:11.427 --> 20:14.082
- Y'all savages go on
and kill each other.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.303
Saves Dixie Mob
a whole heap a effort.

20:29.967 --> 20:33.232
- It's for Marcus.
- Give me that.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.931
- It's life and
death stakes, no?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.977
Oh, God!

20:43.242 --> 20:47.158
You say I have no taste,
but note taste delicious.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.596
- God damn you!

20:49.639 --> 20:53.208
What'd it say?
Who's it from?

20:53.252 --> 20:57.038
- That is for me to know.
- Oh, fuck you, Viktor.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.301
And thanks for helping me.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.444
- Hey, man, you crazy?

21:11.487 --> 21:13.620
You go out in the hall
during clampdown,

21:13.663 --> 21:16.362
and Lin will fuck you up,
for real.

21:35.685 --> 21:38.340
- Saya, I got to talk to you.
- Marcus?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.603
- Listen to me, Maria--

21:42.475 --> 21:44.607
- What's so urgent?

21:50.918 --> 21:54.051
- Why is it you are at the
center of all of my problems?

21:56.924 --> 21:58.491
- Damaged merchandise--

22:00.623 --> 22:03.060
- Yukio.
Who did it?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.848
- What happened to Chico?

22:13.070 --> 22:15.203
- I offered you a home.

22:15.246 --> 22:19.555
Offered you training,
offered you purpose.

22:19.599 --> 22:23.603
You repay my generosity
with chaos.

22:23.646 --> 22:27.258
- I bet if you keep hitting me,
it'll sort itself out.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.783
Isn't that the solution
to everything?

22:29.826 --> 22:33.090
Isn't that what you
basically teach here?

22:33.134 --> 22:35.528
- You've not been
paying attention.

22:56.549 --> 23:00.466
- How?
How did you get this?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.967
- Who killed Yukio?
- I don't know.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.317
- Why did Juan attack Saya?
- I don't know.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.928
- Are you dating Maria?
- No.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.799
- Who murdered Chico?
- I don't know.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.628
- Did you kill the children
at the orphanage?

23:32.672 --> 23:34.674
- Yes.

23:36.066 --> 23:41.202
- And there it is.
You have a tell.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.639
- You will eat in shifts.

23:43.683 --> 23:47.208
Your groups will have five
minutes to gather your food.

23:47.251 --> 23:50.820
If you utter a word,
I'll have your tongue.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.649
If you so much as brush past
another student,

23:53.693 --> 23:55.782
I'll take your hand.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.873
- We take out Juan
and no one else.

24:15.323 --> 24:17.717
What are you doing?

24:17.760 --> 24:21.198
- Well, the most vulnerable
parts of the human body

24:21.242 --> 24:23.723
are around the tummy, so...

24:30.860 --> 24:34.734
- If I'm Saya, I'm going to try
and jump you at the cafeteria.

24:48.704 --> 24:52.839
- You asking yourself
how well you know her?

24:52.882 --> 24:56.103
She's your best friend, right?

24:56.146 --> 24:59.323
What's a best friend at King's?

24:59.367 --> 25:02.631
What happens
to the trusting types?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.779
Atta girl.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.901
- Kill her!

26:10.351 --> 26:12.832
- Leave that one.

26:15.486 --> 26:19.708
I have found the poison
coursing through King's.

26:24.713 --> 26:28.195
- I know it was you.
All of it.

26:29.196 --> 26:33.766
Chico, Yukio.
You're lethal.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.725
Normally, I'd commend you.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.772
Perhaps offer you
to the Green Temple.

26:39.815 --> 26:43.297
Only you are not just lethal.

26:45.691 --> 26:49.651
You are a cancer,
spreading rapidly.

26:49.695 --> 26:53.742
Saya, Marcus.

26:53.786 --> 26:56.353
Everyone around you succumbs--

26:58.268 --> 27:00.488
To the infection.

27:02.751 --> 27:07.408
The only remedy for your type
of malignancy...

27:10.846 --> 27:12.805
Is to cut it out.

27:38.352 --> 27:43.749
- A senseless tragedy, one with
no closure, no justice.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.708
You know the feeling
of that purgatory, Marcus.

27:52.758 --> 27:56.979
- Senseless tragedy.
What other kind is there?

27:57.023 --> 27:59.808
- Necessary.

27:59.852 --> 28:05.727
- Was Jurgen necessary?
He warned me about this place.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.729
And no one's seen him since.

28:07.773 --> 28:11.646
- Jurgen left for
greater opportunities.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.475
You're searching for conspiracy

28:14.518 --> 28:16.825
because the truth
is far more painful.

28:16.869 --> 28:20.916
Look, everybody leaves you.

28:29.490 --> 28:33.929
Confess, we'll navigate
the consequences together.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.584
Confession brings relief
for yourself

28:36.627 --> 28:41.371
as well as your victims.
- Confess what?

28:41.415 --> 28:46.420
- You continue lying,
you'll lose your home here.

28:46.463 --> 28:49.945
Lose your friends,
Your dear love, Maria.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.907
You'll lose me.

28:54.950 --> 28:59.607
The only person on this Earth
willing to help you.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.392
- I don't know anything!

29:02.436 --> 29:08.007
- One more lie, one more lie,
and you'll be back there.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.009
I'll usher you
out of this school.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.794
I will turn my back
on you forever!

29:12.838 --> 29:16.755
No more friends, no more home.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.112
I'm not the enemy.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.854
Not all authority
will disappoint you.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.464
Not all parents leave.

29:30.507 --> 29:35.469
But be very clear,
this is your last chance.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.648
Your next words
will define your future.

29:57.578 --> 30:00.102
- We were--we were in Vegas.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.586
Chico followed us.

30:05.629 --> 30:08.894
He caught me with Maria,
so she...

30:12.071 --> 30:14.813
Diablo would have killed her.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.958
You lied.

30:30.002 --> 30:33.614
Blamed Chico's death on Yukio.

30:33.657 --> 30:38.619
- Yukio let the Kamigas and...
he got--got Jaden killed.

30:40.142 --> 30:43.711
So Maria thought...

30:43.754 --> 30:45.669
she...

30:56.028 --> 30:59.161
- Okay, so if I put
my leg there...

31:00.119 --> 31:01.860
- And I jab a finger there...

31:01.903 --> 31:03.513
- You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.254
Guys, come on.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.082
I have done everything
I can do by myself.

31:07.126 --> 31:08.170
Are you chickens ready?

31:11.217 --> 31:12.479
- I can't.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.572
I don't want the first time
I have sex with you

31:18.615 --> 31:20.922
to be ruined by seeing Lex

31:20.966 --> 31:22.445
grunting at me
from the other side.

31:22.489 --> 31:25.231
- Look, this is the only way,
so be it!

31:25.274 --> 31:30.932
But, so you know,
and I don't love saying this.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.153
I like you, too, a bit.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.158
- Of course I know you like me.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.073
What, you think
I'd fuck someone

31:41.116 --> 31:43.640
who's just
a total asshole to me?

31:43.684 --> 31:46.469
I--I like sex,
but I'm not a masochist.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.297
Like, why--why can't we just
have a good time

31:48.341 --> 31:50.473
and then, let whatever
might happen

31:50.517 --> 31:53.476
in the future just
take care of itself?

31:53.520 --> 31:55.087
- Come on,
if we do it like this,

31:55.130 --> 31:56.915
you'll only ever see my feet.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.659
- Yukio was a drug addict.

32:05.010 --> 32:08.404
He owed Chico a debt
too steep to be repayed.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.583
Chico attempted
to collect, and...

32:13.627 --> 32:16.978
Yukio murdered him.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.980
You must have heard by now that

32:19.024 --> 32:21.548
Yukio was found
with his throat cut.

32:21.591 --> 32:26.988
- He deserved much worse.
Him and his accomplices.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.948
- There's no evidence
of a larger conspiracy.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.994
- Convenient.

32:34.604 --> 32:37.303
If Chico hadn't been dealing
drugs on school grounds,

32:37.346 --> 32:39.174
I--I would have been able
to prevent this.

32:39.218 --> 32:43.396
- My son is dead,
and you're going to lecture me

32:43.439 --> 32:45.964
about your
academy's guidelines?

32:59.238 --> 33:03.546
You can't understand my pain.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.418
But you will.

33:07.420 --> 33:11.424
- Your threats...

33:11.467 --> 33:15.036
they're unnecessary.
They earn you nothing.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.474
I have nothing left to lose.

33:18.518 --> 33:23.740
I, too, lost a child.
I know your agony.

33:23.784 --> 33:28.397
Relentless desire
for vengeance.

33:28.441 --> 33:32.532
But Chico's killer is dead.
You could kill a dozen more,

33:32.575 --> 33:36.536
but no amount of blood
would sate your grief.

33:36.579 --> 33:40.583
Justice has been exacted.
Find peace in that.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.511
- You have any old friends?

34:41.601 --> 34:44.517
People who know you
inside and out?

34:46.867 --> 34:50.088
They're rare.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.046
Valuable.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.833
Yukio was my oldest friend.

34:59.619 --> 35:03.144
- We both know he didn't
have shit to do with Chico.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.191
But I think I know who did.

35:08.758 --> 35:11.326
- Walk away.

35:11.370 --> 35:14.677
- I don't listen to you.
Not anymore.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.744
- You picked the wrong side.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.628
- Is it true?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.722
- Yes.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.772
Yukio betrayed you.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.209
- Then why didn't you
come to me?

36:12.953 --> 36:15.434
You don't trust me.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.786
I was just trying to help you.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.273
- Don't.

36:39.371 --> 36:42.243
- Fine, I'm in.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.118
- Uh, I--I don't know.

36:48.162 --> 36:52.253
I mean, it's not exactly
the version I dreamt of.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.255
- You're going to miss out
over some gay panic?

36:54.299 --> 36:56.866
- No--no problem
with gay, love.

36:56.910 --> 37:00.914
It's just the idea of seeing
Billy boy's undulating scrotum.

37:00.957 --> 37:03.090
- Okay, Lex is out.
It's just you and me

37:03.133 --> 37:04.787
and my undulating scrotum.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.095
- It's both of you
or none of you.

37:15.842 --> 37:19.933
- I promise to avoid
all eye contact.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.805
- You stick to your port,
I'll stick to mine, yes?

37:22.849 --> 37:26.418
Think manly thoughts of
lumberjacks and black coffee.

37:30.900 --> 37:35.165
- When you're old--
like, 40,

37:35.209 --> 37:38.778
you are going to hate yourself
for not having this experience.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.214
I mean, seriously.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.306
I wouldn't just ask anyone.

I'm starving.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.448
Too many feelings
flying around anyways.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.102
- Is it because
we have feelings

38:42.145 --> 38:43.495
that you're leaving us
like this,

38:43.538 --> 38:46.280
or is it just that
feelings disgust you?

38:47.934 --> 38:51.198
- Yes.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.422

38:59.946 --> 39:04.820

center of all trouble.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.519
- And why bring this to me
and not Master Lin?

39:07.562 --> 39:10.478
- My pa always told me to
bet on the winning horse,

39:10.522 --> 39:13.089
even if it means changing
your bet mid-race.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.918
- Mm, you are the boss
of the boss.

39:15.962 --> 39:20.053
If I am to suck boot, I will
suck the most prosperous one.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.539
- Let's put that to the test.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.864
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

39:48.908 --> 39:52.390

and find you.

40:20.983 --> 40:24.596
It's important not to forget
that's the way people operate.

40:26.902 --> 40:29.992
Less of a surprise later on.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.517
- Damn, the freakiest shit

40:32.560 --> 40:34.475

40:34.519 --> 40:37.347

It's important.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.389
Secrets got us into this.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.261
Holding onto bad feelings,

41:21.304 --> 41:25.657
not being honest,
not trusting each other.

41:25.700 --> 41:30.444
All this back-biting
and shit-talking and drama.

41:35.754 --> 41:38.147
You guys are the only family
I've had since my--

41:38.191 --> 41:39.584
my folks died.

41:44.023 --> 41:47.113
And I can't lose you.

41:47.156 --> 41:49.550
- Come on, man.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.291
- Yeah, well, in the spirit
of full disclosure,

41:51.334 --> 41:54.424
I want to tell you all
the truth about me.

41:59.168 --> 42:02.084
I didn't kill all those kids
at the boy's home,

42:02.128 --> 42:05.479
but when I escaped,
I let loose the guy who did.

42:07.394 --> 42:13.182
I had this roommate,
a psycho named Chester.

42:13.226 --> 42:16.577
He followed us to Vegas
and he found Chico's body.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.711
- What?
- That's not the worst of it.

42:19.754 --> 42:23.758
He--he has this deadline...

42:26.587 --> 42:29.155
And we're running out of time.
