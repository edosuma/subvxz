KAISA: Witches hear the immortal whispers

00:27.600 --> 00:30.592
of those who pass between the worlds.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.157
They speak of a child who is destined
to bring the end of destiny.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.034
If told what she must do,

00:40.160 --> 00:42.117
she will fail.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.637
But she won't walk alone.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.196
There is a boy

00:57.320 --> 01:00.631
whose fate is bound with hers.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.356
Together, they will change everything.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.750
- JACK: Careful in the back there, Tony!
- TONY: I am.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.633
JACK: We need those weapons.
Guard them well!

TONY: I am!

01:16.840 --> 01:18.990
LYRA: Mr Scoresby, you're not walking?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.872
LEE: Three reasons.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.911
One - I struggle terribly with bunions.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.714
Two - someone's got
to protect this balloon.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.069
I can protect your balloon.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.555
Protection requires a certain expertise.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.034
I've got expertise!

01:31.160 --> 01:33.549
You got something, kid,
I'll give you that.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.672
Number three -
why walk when you can ride?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.950
Then why aren't you in your balloon now?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.674
Saving it for when it's needed.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.918
Wouldn't it be useful
to have a view of what's ahead?

01:45.040 --> 01:48.999
We have. And a witch's daemon is
a better eye in the sky than I'll ever be.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.189
Mr Scoresby?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.118
Call me Lee.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.834
We're going to win this one, aren't we?

01:56.960 --> 01:59.270
We're going to get those children back?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.357
Well, if I was a betting man, I'd say no.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.153
And I am a betting man.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.874
But I can tell from your face
you want me to say yes,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.389
So...yes.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.955
You're not an easy man to like.
You know that, Lee?

02:11.080 --> 02:13.151
So people tell me.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.876
- BOREAL: He comes home every lunchtime?
- MAN: Every day.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.196
BOREAL: And he looks after her full-time?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.118
MAN: Seems so.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.919
And none of your authorities
were involved?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.873
No social services right now,
as far as I can see.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.036
So no-one checks up on them?

02:49.680 --> 02:51.114
Hmm.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.319
BOREAL: There he is.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.034
Right on time.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.873
He seems like a good kid.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.392
- Lyra.
- You asked to see me?

04:55.520 --> 04:58.831
Your bear? You were right. We needed him.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.193
LYRA: He looks magnificent, doesn't he?

05:04.320 --> 05:06.391
I want you to consult your symbol reader.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.718
I want to know more about how
they're defending this place - Bolvangar.

guard the Station.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.276
They have fences all around it.

It's trying to tell me something else.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.477
It's trying to warn me of something.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.150
I suspect it's trying to warn you
of everything.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.998
We're walking into a blood battle here.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.759
But we're ready.

FARDER CORAM: Heave to, lads!

06:04.240 --> 06:08.871
If you think that's bad,
wait till we hit the snow and ice!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.879
The alethiometer told me...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.877
- I was asking about Bolvangar...
- Hello, Lyra.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.196
Yes, hello. And it told me
about the next valley.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.871
There's a village with something horrible
in it and folks are troubled by a...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.752
Yes?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.837
...a ghost, I think.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.157
Or something. It's connected
to our task, but I don't know how.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.350
I think I need to go to it.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.436
No.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.789
I'll go alone.

06:38.360 --> 06:43.594
So you want me
to let you go off on your own

06:43.720 --> 06:46.360
to look for some horrible ghost?

06:46.480 --> 06:50.792
We need to get to Bolvangar
to rescue our children.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.914
Have you forgotten
how much you are hunted?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.553
By my mother?

06:56.680 --> 06:57.795
Mmm.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.595
I can't be afraid of my mother
for the rest of my life.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.154
You taught me that.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.032
All right.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.390
I'll give you some other reasons.
We need you.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.195
It's two days' walk to Bolvangar.
Anything could befall us.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.119
Your skills with the alethiometer
keeps us safe.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.754
The alethiometer says I need to go.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.511
Well, Ma Costa's down there, mm?

07:23.640 --> 07:27.474
Do you want to go and tell her
that her son has to wait

07:27.600 --> 07:30.035
because you went off on a whim?

07:30.160 --> 07:33.118
It's not a whim. I trust it.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.232
I don't know why, but I need to go.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.600
We can't let you go, Lyra.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.155
This is too important.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.634
I'm sorry.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.838
There's somewhere else I need to go.
A fishing settlement.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.474
The alethiometer says I must go.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.318
Farder Coram won't let me.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.238
He give you a reason why?

08:23.640 --> 08:26.280
Cos they want to carry on to Bolvangar

08:26.400 --> 08:29.358
cos they need to get Billy back.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.914
And Roger.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.315
Tony, look after the food.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.272
I'll burn it.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.595
I don't care.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.196
What do you say is in this village?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.556
I'm not sure, but it might be...

08:50.680 --> 08:53.274
...some sort of ghost, I think.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.477
Something awful has happened there.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.116
Why is this ghost important?

09:00.240 --> 09:04.473
I don't know,
but it might be a vital clue.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.160
It might help me find Roger and Billy.

to look for him up there.

Kaisa, is he right?
Is there a city in the lights?

16:04.680 --> 16:06.353
KAISA: He believes so,

16:06.480 --> 16:10.951
and the Magisterium thinks
he intends to use Dust in some way

16:11.080 --> 16:13.913

between this world

and duplicitous

And even if I am too weak to fight them,

18:44.520 --> 18:47.638
Yes. While it may be madness
to confront them,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.717
we cannot stand by.

18:49.840 --> 18:53.993
