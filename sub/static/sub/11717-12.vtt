00:14.164 --> 00:15.785
Let's go. Let's go.

00:15.786 --> 00:17.533
Keep moving. Keep moving.

00:27.477 --> 00:28.477
Nobody gets through here.

00:28.478 --> 00:31.280
Hey! Hey! Where is he?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.616
Over there. Hey, you can't go out there

00:33.617 --> 00:34.983
without a blast suit!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.340
Chin! Chin!

00:42.349 --> 00:43.440
Guys, what are you doing?

00:43.441 --> 00:46.328
Don't move. Don't move.

00:46.329 --> 00:49.064
You need to be in suits.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.102
You're not wearing one, neither are we.

00:55.005 --> 00:57.840
Chin, we're gonna get you
out of this thing, okay?

00:57.841 --> 00:59.275
He got the drop on me.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.476
Never should have happened.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.144
This isn't your fault, okay?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.679
Just don't move.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.582
This bomb has a Mercury motion sensor...
If you move,

01:06.583 --> 01:07.616
it'll activate.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.184
Listen, just tell us what you saw.

01:09.185 --> 01:10.101
I didn't see anything.

01:10.102 --> 01:11.208
I got hit from behind.

01:11.209 --> 01:12.767
I blacked out.

01:13.122 --> 01:15.282
I woke up here with that hood over my head.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.304
- There's something else you should know.
- What?

01:18.305 --> 01:20.562
He said he would contact you
with instructions.

01:20.563 --> 01:22.465
And if you didn't comply...

01:22.466 --> 01:23.997
I'd be dead.

02:59.295 --> 03:01.529
Oh, look at this. Santa Claus.

03:01.530 --> 03:02.868
Mele Kalikimaka.

03:02.869 --> 03:06.702
No, no, no, no, not, uh, not here.
Remember?

03:06.703 --> 03:07.970
Yeah, yeah, okay.

03:07.971 --> 03:09.895
Your house, your King's English.

03:09.896 --> 03:10.783
Mm-hmm.

03:10.784 --> 03:11.808
Good morning, sir,

03:11.809 --> 03:13.065
and Merry Christmas.

03:13.066 --> 03:14.789
I have acquired your request.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.113
Yeah? Nice one, eh?

03:18.114 --> 03:20.149
No, no, no, not nice. What is this?

03:20.150 --> 03:21.183
Is this a tent?

03:21.184 --> 03:22.551
What you mean?

03:22.552 --> 03:24.704
This is clearly not gonna work for me.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.188
- You see? 
- You could alter it.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.523
You could alter it to what?

03:27.524 --> 03:29.597
You gonna put pockets on it
and make it a pool table?

03:29.598 --> 03:31.293
This isn't gonna work, buddy. 
Come on.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.205
You told me your cousin
could get me a suit.

03:33.206 --> 03:34.968
Call me crazy, I thought that
when he said he could do it,

03:34.969 --> 03:36.365
it would be in my size range.

03:36.366 --> 03:37.932
This wouldn't even fit you.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.531
You could always order it online.

03:39.532 --> 03:41.204
No, no, no, I can't order
anything online because

03:41.205 --> 03:43.002
I ordered that tree online
and look what I got.

03:43.003 --> 03:45.641
Look at it. Ooh, that's what that is.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.076
Listen to me.

03:47.077 --> 03:49.411
This seems silly, but it's
very important to me.

03:49.412 --> 03:50.737
I dress up as Santa Claus every year

03:50.773 --> 03:52.081
for my daughter Grace.

03:52.082 --> 03:53.816
I need a suit that fits,

03:53.817 --> 03:56.232
and this... this is ridiculous.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.353
Daniel, if you do this every year,

03:58.354 --> 04:00.389
why don't you own a Santa suit?

04:00.390 --> 04:01.723
I did. It looked very nice on me.

04:01.724 --> 04:04.093
It was a svelte suit. It fit me, okay?

04:04.094 --> 04:05.494
But I lost it in the divorce.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.700
Ah, bummahs!

04:09.959 --> 04:12.234
I still think it's good.

04:12.235 --> 04:13.047
For you maybe.

04:13.048 --> 04:14.537
Yeah, hello.

04:14.538 --> 04:18.583
Okay, I'm here. 
Pick me up on the way.

04:28.084 --> 04:29.785
Chin, what do you got?

04:29.786 --> 04:32.554
Couple of guys out night
surfing came across a floater.

04:32.555 --> 04:35.223
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

04:36.059 --> 04:38.226
That's Luther Magallanes.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.995
What, you know him?

04:39.996 --> 04:41.130
I figured you would.

04:41.131 --> 04:43.132
Yeah, he's a major arms dealer.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.600
He was one of the go-to
guys for Al Qaeda in Iraq,

04:44.601 --> 04:46.535
but after the surge, he went dark.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.736
Interpol's been looking
for him ever since.

04:47.737 --> 04:49.638
Well, they can scratch him
off their list.

04:49.639 --> 04:51.240
M.E. said cause of death
was two gunshot wounds

04:51.241 --> 04:52.241
to the back of the cranium.

04:52.242 --> 04:53.942
Execution style.

04:53.943 --> 04:56.078
Yeah, but there were
several anomalies.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.279
Anomalies?

04:57.280 --> 04:58.614
Yeah. That's what Max called them.

04:58.615 --> 04:59.882
You know how he likes the big words.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.718
According to him, the victim
was dead about two days

05:02.719 --> 05:04.920
before his body was
discovered in the ocean.

05:04.921 --> 05:07.523
It's a classic body dump.
Nothing anomalous about it.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.192
Max also found chlorine in his lungs,

05:10.193 --> 05:11.426
and heavy bruising around his neck.

05:11.427 --> 05:12.961
So did they dunk him in the pool

05:12.962 --> 05:14.429
before they popped him
twice in the head?

05:14.430 --> 05:16.765
Shooter might have tortured
him for information first.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.167
Wait a minute. Just hang on a sec.

05:18.168 --> 05:21.737
What? Luther Magallanes is high-profile.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.572
I mean, this guy's got serious backing,

05:23.573 --> 05:26.742
which means whoever eliminated
him doesn't care about payback.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.106
All right.

05:28.107 --> 05:31.471
So whoever killed him either has
a bigger operation going on,

05:31.472 --> 05:34.334
or he is just one fearless,
fearless son of a bitch.

05:34.826 --> 05:36.351
The fearless ones, huh?

05:36.352 --> 05:37.753
They're the ones with nothing to lose.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.354
Great. We need more bullets.

05:41.457 --> 05:44.440
Gentlemen, I think I found
our primary crime scene.

05:45.995 --> 05:48.293
This is where Magallanes's
body was recovered.

05:48.631 --> 05:49.961
Now, if we take into account time of death

05:49.962 --> 05:51.590
and try to pinpoint the exact location

05:51.591 --> 05:52.940
where the body went into the water...

05:52.941 --> 05:55.332
Using tide pull and speed of current..

05:55.452 --> 05:58.267
The body must have gone in
somewhere in this vicinity.

05:58.268 --> 05:59.511
What is that place?

05:59.512 --> 06:02.945
The Ikalani resort.
642-acre real estate wonder.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.414
Very high-end, very secluded.

06:05.415 --> 06:06.648
They own that whole stretch of beach.

06:06.649 --> 06:08.350
Private villas, secluded pools,

06:08.351 --> 06:10.986
easy access to cliffs where
you could dump a body.

06:10.987 --> 06:12.408
Especially with two bullets in it.

06:12.409 --> 06:14.116
I contacted the Ikalani.

06:14.117 --> 06:16.058
It turns out that Luther Magallanes

06:16.059 --> 06:17.159
owns a private villa there.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.194
I had them pull their security footage

06:19.195 --> 06:20.596
right around our estimated time of death.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.364
And it just arrived.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.460
There's our boy.

06:25.461 --> 06:27.069
Luther Magallanes.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.482
Who's that with him?

06:31.541 --> 06:33.942
Stop the tape. Stop the tape, Kino.

06:33.943 --> 06:35.104
Push in.

06:39.382 --> 06:41.316
That's Victor Hesse.

06:48.091 --> 06:50.192
Whatever these people want, Steve,

06:50.193 --> 06:51.518
don't give it to them.

06:51.519 --> 06:54.142
Dad, I'm going to get you out of there.
All right?

06:54.143 --> 06:55.731
Don't you give it to them! No more games!

06:55.732 --> 06:57.165
Dad? Dad?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.649
No!

07:06.058 --> 07:07.919
Steve McGarrett here. Get me the governor.

07:08.848 --> 07:11.001
I don't care what she's doing.
Pull her out of the meeting.

07:13.149 --> 07:15.799
Tell her the man that killed
my father is still alive.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.940
Thanks.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.671
Lab techs found some fresh prints.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.193
It's confirmed.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.691
Hesse was here.

07:39.081 --> 07:40.310
I'm sorry, Steve.

07:40.311 --> 07:41.609
How is Victor Hesse even alive?

07:41.610 --> 07:43.631
I mean, I put two shots straight
through the guy's chest.

07:43.632 --> 07:45.802
The guy's a cockroach. It's what they do...

07:45.803 --> 07:48.071
They come back from the dead.

07:48.072 --> 07:50.151
Next time you step on him,
don't take your foot off.

07:51.943 --> 07:52.977
All right.

07:52.978 --> 07:54.408
If Hesse is still on the island,

07:54.409 --> 07:55.860
we can assume he's not getting off, right?

07:55.861 --> 07:57.136
He's on everybody's watch list.

07:57.137 --> 07:58.611
Plus we've got his only known associate,

07:58.612 --> 08:00.502
- Sang Min, behind bars. 
- That's good.

08:00.685 --> 08:02.953
Which brings us to Luther Magallanes.

08:02.954 --> 08:05.622
Now, I was thinking,
since both he and Hesse

08:05.623 --> 08:06.790
were involved in illegal arms,

08:06.791 --> 08:08.492
either they were working
on a deal together,

08:08.493 --> 08:11.528
or Hesse is eliminating his competition

08:11.529 --> 08:12.896
to reestablish himself
back in the business.

08:14.128 --> 08:15.171
What's that?

08:15.172 --> 08:18.035
Uh, HPD found a cell phone in
a tide pool off the cliffs.

08:18.036 --> 08:19.202
Could have dropped out

08:19.203 --> 08:20.464
of Luther's pocket when Hesse tossed him.

08:20.465 --> 08:21.927
Might give you some answers.

08:21.928 --> 08:23.082
I'll get on it.

08:31.282 --> 08:33.183
Little early for lunch
there, isn't it, cuz?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.186
Magallanes's cell phone

08:36.187 --> 08:38.054
was in a tide pool for the last two days.

08:38.056 --> 08:39.390
Saltwater fried the circuitry,

08:39.390 --> 08:41.158
but the SIM card is still intact.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.509
So the rice. Yeah.

08:42.510 --> 08:44.695
Pulls the moisture off the SIM card.

08:45.730 --> 08:46.897
Okay.

08:46.898 --> 08:48.832
Let's see what we got.

08:51.569 --> 08:53.737
Looks like we've got Luther's call history.

08:53.738 --> 08:54.725
Nice work.

08:59.711 --> 09:00.844
Chin, what do you got?

09:00.845 --> 09:01.845
Trent Agustin.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.180
Local kine gun dealer.

09:03.181 --> 09:05.749
Luther called him twice
on the day he was killed.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.117
If they're in business together,

09:07.118 --> 09:08.986
I figure Trent might know
where we can find Hesse.

09:08.987 --> 09:09.957
Where is he?

09:30.243 --> 09:32.238
- You see those guys, right? 
- They'll move.

09:34.078 --> 09:34.832
No, they don't look like they're moving.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.713
-They'll move.
-Hey!

09:37.982 --> 09:39.716
Told you.

09:52.004 --> 09:53.463
This is a chicken fight?

09:53.464 --> 09:54.631
Are you kidding me?

09:54.632 --> 09:56.600
Every place has got its black eye.

09:56.601 --> 09:58.702
I mean, Jersey's got tanning salons.
We got this.

10:01.039 --> 10:03.206
Hey! Ho!

10:03.207 --> 10:04.875
Okay. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

10:04.876 --> 10:06.310
Everybody. You, Birdman, stop.

10:06.311 --> 10:07.811
Please. Okay?

10:07.812 --> 10:11.682
Now, although I do not agree
with nor do I see the fun

10:11.683 --> 10:13.016
in watching my dinner

10:13.017 --> 10:15.085
brawl it out in a steel cage match,

10:15.086 --> 10:16.853
that is not what we're doing here.

10:16.854 --> 10:18.055
We're not here to arrest you.

10:18.056 --> 10:19.823
We're just looking for Trent Agustin.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.831
So please, Trent, step forward.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.194
Or nobody says anything,

10:24.195 --> 10:25.821
and everybody goes to jail.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.950
Okay, Birdman, put the bird down. 
Come on.

10:28.951 --> 10:30.500
Hey. Hey.

10:30.501 --> 10:31.668
That's not necessary.

10:31.669 --> 10:33.728
I'm Trent Agustin.

10:33.729 --> 10:36.573
All right, everybody. 
Put the birds back

10:36.574 --> 10:37.774
where the birds go, and
clear this place out.

10:37.775 --> 10:39.409
You're done here today. You, come on.

10:39.410 --> 10:40.825
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

10:42.355 --> 10:44.281
You think Hesse did this?

10:44.282 --> 10:46.583
Okay, look, we're not here
to discuss the finer points

10:46.584 --> 10:48.452
of detective work with you.

10:48.453 --> 10:49.786
Just need you to answer our questions.

10:49.787 --> 10:50.816
That's all.

10:51.390 --> 10:54.191
We were involved in a few
transactions with Hesse.

10:54.192 --> 10:55.792
He trusted us.

10:55.793 --> 10:58.261
- He came to us when he was injured.
- When he was injured?

10:58.262 --> 11:00.063
Let me guess...
He had a couple holes in him?

11:00.064 --> 11:01.598
He was in bad shape.

11:01.599 --> 11:03.033
We referred him to a doctor

11:03.034 --> 11:04.869
who specializes in this kind of clientele.

11:04.870 --> 11:05.957
What's the doctor's name?

11:08.245 --> 11:10.974
Dr. Frank Galey, general practice.

11:10.975 --> 11:12.709
Office in Kahala, home
in St. Louis Heights.

11:12.710 --> 11:15.445
Divorced, lives alone. Criminal record?

11:15.446 --> 11:17.481
Not even a speeding ticket.
Hey, just got off the phone

11:17.482 --> 11:18.915
with Galey's office and
one of his neighbors.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.817
Uh, no one's seen the
good doctor for months.

11:20.818 --> 11:23.153
- And no one filed a missing persons?
- Apparently not.

11:23.154 --> 11:24.855
Galey sent out an e-mail to friends,

11:24.856 --> 11:26.590
family and colleagues 
about eight weeks ago

11:26.591 --> 11:28.258
that he was taking a much needed,

11:28.259 --> 11:29.760
well-earned trip around the world.

11:29.761 --> 11:32.386
Well, I'm sure he won't mind
us looking around his house.

11:52.417 --> 11:54.418
Danny, Chin, take the back.

11:54.419 --> 11:56.486
Kono, you're on me.

12:05.096 --> 12:07.831
Dr. Galey, Five-0. 
Open up.

12:20.044 --> 12:21.445
Clear.

12:21.446 --> 12:22.879
Clear.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.130
Let's check the garage.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.200
Bullets yours?

12:43.201 --> 12:44.668
Nine millimeters.

12:59.484 --> 13:01.151
You put two of those in
Hesse and didn't kill him?

13:01.152 --> 13:03.420
Next time, shoot him in the face.

13:03.421 --> 13:04.922
Uh, boss?

13:09.716 --> 13:10.761
Dr. Galey.

13:12.330 --> 13:15.332
Guess he won't be making
house calls anymore.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.314
They got a nicer tree than I do.

13:33.434 --> 13:34.543
Your tree is fine.

13:34.544 --> 13:35.964
No, my tree is not fine.

13:35.965 --> 13:38.261
It's small. It's depressing.
It's pathetic, okay?

13:38.262 --> 13:40.309
No, it's just like your apartment.
It's perfect.

13:42.099 --> 13:43.499
You know what's perfect?

13:43.500 --> 13:47.070
Perfect is that I get Grace for
six hours on Christmas day.

13:47.071 --> 13:49.305
Okay? Six hours, just her and I alone

13:49.306 --> 13:50.873
in my apartment, okay?

13:50.874 --> 13:53.810
If I was back home, we'd
be at my mother's house.

13:53.811 --> 13:55.912
I mean, forget about the
food that she would cook,

13:55.913 --> 13:58.281
but I would have a big tree...
a huge, lovely tree...

13:58.282 --> 13:59.849
and Grace would be surrounded
by people that love her.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.217
Listen to me, all right?

14:01.218 --> 14:03.586
I know something about being
raised by a single father.

14:03.587 --> 14:05.121
All Grace is going to remember

14:05.122 --> 14:06.956
is that she spent her Christmas with dad.

14:06.957 --> 14:08.124
Okay? That's what's perfect.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.093
So just relax with the tree.

14:10.094 --> 14:11.727
Here's Sang Min.

14:22.806 --> 14:24.374
Back so soon?

14:24.375 --> 14:25.775
Well, what can I say?

14:25.776 --> 14:27.443
I missed your smile. 
Let me guess.

14:27.444 --> 14:28.450
You need my help.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.236
We found out Victor Hesse is still alive.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.451
You're not a very good shot, are you?

14:35.452 --> 14:36.753
Listen to me.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.888
Victor Hesse has been living here

14:38.889 --> 14:41.626
off the grid for the last four months.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.239
All right? We know your business

14:43.240 --> 14:44.756
is keeping people under the radar,

14:44.757 --> 14:46.896
so we thought you could help us find him.

14:46.897 --> 14:49.065
You thought wrong.

14:49.066 --> 14:50.842
Just tell us where he is.

14:50.843 --> 14:53.739
Detective, I already helped you once, huh?

14:53.740 --> 14:55.707
And it's in your best
interest to help us again.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.142
How do you figure?

14:59.143 --> 15:00.676
Listen to me.

15:00.677 --> 15:03.164
I'm going to find Victor
Hesse with our without you,

15:03.165 --> 15:05.415
and if I find him without
you, I'm going to tell him

15:05.416 --> 15:07.471
that you're the one who led
me to him six months ago.

15:07.472 --> 15:09.419
How do you think he's
going to feel about that?

15:09.420 --> 15:11.654
More to the point, how long you
think you're going to last

15:11.655 --> 15:13.489
in here when everybody
finds out you're a rat?

15:19.863 --> 15:21.798
Take your time.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.744
Kishimoto.

15:24.864 --> 15:26.096
Kishimoto? What?

15:26.097 --> 15:27.859
- Who's Kishimoto? 
- He's a facilitator

15:27.860 --> 15:30.306
for the Japanese underground in Honolulu.

15:30.307 --> 15:32.208
He's a facilitator? 
What does that mean?

15:32.209 --> 15:33.641
He's the man to see if your visa expires

15:33.642 --> 15:35.445
and you don't want to go home.

15:35.446 --> 15:37.030
He sets you up with papers,

15:37.031 --> 15:38.915
real estate, cars, whatever you need.

15:38.916 --> 15:42.218
Okay, if this guy, Kishimoto,
is so connected,

15:42.219 --> 15:43.653
how do we know that he hasn't

15:43.654 --> 15:44.988
already helped Hesse off the island?

15:44.989 --> 15:46.327
Because that's not what he does.

15:46.328 --> 15:47.967
That's what I do, huh?

15:47.968 --> 15:50.674
Just get us a meeting with Kishimoto, okay?

15:52.149 --> 15:55.164
No way you'll get in
there unless I'm there.

15:55.165 --> 15:56.473
Look at this guy. What are you doing,

15:56.474 --> 15:58.250
angling for another field trip?

15:58.251 --> 15:59.936
Whatever you got to do.

15:59.937 --> 16:02.171
But you need me.

16:02.172 --> 16:03.840
Huh?

16:03.841 --> 16:07.376
How badly do you want to find Victor Hesse?

16:13.183 --> 16:14.617
Whew!

16:15.452 --> 16:16.886
Check you out.

16:16.887 --> 16:18.417
You're like the Asian John Travolta.

16:18.925 --> 16:20.991
Got one more piece of
jewelry for you, babe.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.112
Now you're perfect.

16:45.015 --> 16:46.934
I've driven by this place 10,000 times.

16:46.935 --> 16:48.424
I never knew it was a private club.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.885
Why would you? You can't afford it.

16:54.991 --> 16:57.149
Sang Min.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.395
I didn't hear about your early release.

16:59.396 --> 17:01.064
'Cause I haven't been released.

17:01.065 --> 17:02.799
These gentlemen wanted to meet you.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.367
Steve McGarrett, Danny Williams, 
Five-O.

17:06.724 --> 17:10.251
Now, why would you bring law
enforcement into my club?

17:10.252 --> 17:12.675
They're not here for you, Kishimoto.

17:12.675 --> 17:14.711
They're here about Victor Hesse.

17:14.712 --> 17:16.813
Okay? They're cool.

17:17.976 --> 17:20.107
I'll have my men escort you out.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.075
You can have your men
escort me out in a minute.

17:22.076 --> 17:23.720
Just want to show you a couple photos.

17:23.721 --> 17:25.054
These are the only two people

17:25.055 --> 17:26.388
besides you who have helped Victor Hesse

17:26.390 --> 17:27.824
since he's been on the run.

17:29.426 --> 17:31.427
- He did this? 
- What can I say?

17:31.428 --> 17:33.696
Victor Hesse doesn't like loose ends.
Look, you could, uh...

17:33.697 --> 17:35.665
You could be the subject of the next photo

17:35.666 --> 17:37.403
that we go to show the next
people we go to question,

17:37.404 --> 17:39.016
or you could just tell us right now

17:39.017 --> 17:40.069
where Victor Hesse is

17:40.070 --> 17:41.172
and make it easy on everybody.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.665
I set him up in a condo

17:46.666 --> 17:48.578
in Ala Moana on Frank Street.

17:48.579 --> 17:50.236
He's been living there for a few weeks.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.705
Okay. Where does he hang out?

17:51.706 --> 17:54.050
There's a private hostess bar on Nuuanu.

18:07.398 --> 18:08.965
Clear. Clear.

18:08.966 --> 18:10.733
Clear!

18:16.140 --> 18:17.813
Hey. Hesse isn't here.

18:17.814 --> 18:19.139
Just hold your position.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.546
We're at the second location now.

18:20.547 --> 18:21.667
Roger that.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.713
Easy.

18:23.947 --> 18:26.716
Next time, watch the hair, huh?

18:26.717 --> 18:28.551
"Watch the hair, huh?"

18:28.552 --> 18:29.919
Do yourself a favor.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.988
You watch the hair, huh?
Maybe you'll learn something.

18:34.016 --> 18:36.133
I thought we had a bond of trust.

18:36.963 --> 18:38.274
Just sit tight, pal.

18:56.247 --> 18:59.115
So let me get this hostess
bar thing straight.

18:59.116 --> 19:00.917
You're not allowed to
touch any of these girls?

19:00.918 --> 19:02.986
I mean, these guys are buying
them drinks all night...

19:02.987 --> 19:04.387
For what? To talk to them.

19:04.388 --> 19:06.389
Why would anybody want to talk to them?

19:06.390 --> 19:08.057
I'm serious. I'm just asking.

19:08.058 --> 19:10.193
Danny, can we just focus, please?

19:20.771 --> 19:22.505
Danny!

19:23.807 --> 19:25.608
Hey!

19:55.272 --> 19:56.606
All right.

19:56.607 --> 19:58.274
At least he's still got the anklet on.

19:58.275 --> 19:59.842
Make your next right.

19:59.843 --> 20:01.344
They're way ahead of us. Come on.

20:01.345 --> 20:02.679
Come on, come on, come on.
Seat belt. Seat belt.

20:02.680 --> 20:03.880
Good idea. Hey, hey, hey.

20:03.881 --> 20:05.181
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:07.451 --> 20:09.819
All right. Yeah. Do that after

20:09.820 --> 20:11.354
I put the seat belt on, all right?

20:15.159 --> 20:17.627
Whoa, ho, ho, ho.

20:17.628 --> 20:18.628
Hey! Hey!

20:18.629 --> 20:20.630
Oh! Come on, man.

20:27.304 --> 20:31.241
All right. They're, uh,
stopping at Ala Moana harbor.

20:31.242 --> 20:33.042
Chin's two blocks from there. Call him.

20:34.278 --> 20:35.612
Chin.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.314
I'm on my way.

21:00.471 --> 21:02.138
I'm here. Where is he?

21:02.139 --> 21:05.675
All right, he is at the end
of the dock on a boat.

21:05.676 --> 21:07.777
Slip 71.

21:07.778 --> 21:09.853
Okay, he stopped moving. He's inside.

21:09.854 --> 21:11.180
Got it.

21:46.150 --> 21:47.417
Chin!

21:47.418 --> 21:48.914
Chin!

21:48.915 --> 21:50.353
Guys, what are you doing?

21:50.354 --> 21:52.689
Don't move. Don't move.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.657
You need to be in suits.

21:54.658 --> 21:56.859
You're not wearing one,
neither are we. Hey.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.167
Listen, just tell us what you saw.

21:58.168 --> 21:59.495
I didn't see anything.

21:59.496 --> 22:00.946
I got hit from behind.

22:00.947 --> 22:02.198
I blacked out.

22:02.199 --> 22:05.116
I woke up here with that hood over my head.

22:21.218 --> 22:22.552
Victor.

22:22.553 --> 22:24.387
Do you realize that the last time

22:24.388 --> 22:27.090
we spoke like this, I killed your father.

22:27.091 --> 22:30.360
Yeah, and I killed your
brother; score's been settled.

22:30.361 --> 22:33.396
Would be if I believed in
the law of retaliation.

22:33.397 --> 22:35.431
Eye for an eye is 
just not my style, Steve.

22:35.432 --> 22:37.300
So why don't you tell me what you want.

22:37.301 --> 22:38.735
Pretty simple really.

22:38.736 --> 22:41.429
I have the only detonator to
the bomb attached to your man.

22:41.430 --> 22:42.905
I want $10 million and safe passage

22:42.906 --> 22:44.921
off the island or he dies.

22:46.910 --> 22:48.411
I'm gonna find you.

22:48.412 --> 22:50.713
Victor, I'm gonna find you,

22:50.714 --> 22:53.383
and this time, you're not gonna
walk away, you understand?

22:53.384 --> 22:55.585
I'll be in touch in one hour. Steve.

23:14.842 --> 23:16.376
Public's been evacuated.

23:16.377 --> 23:17.577
My men set up a two-block
perimeter around the palace.

23:17.578 --> 23:18.946
All right, make it three.

23:18.947 --> 23:22.137
Hesse's used this type of
bomb before in Belfast, 2002.

23:22.138 --> 23:24.178
Blew the head off a local politician

23:24.179 --> 23:26.019
and he took out a dozen bystanders

23:26.020 --> 23:27.469
who thought they were safe
behind the barricades.

23:27.470 --> 23:28.562
What do my men need to
know about this thing?

23:28.563 --> 23:31.674
It's made of biometric armor
with a Mercury motion sensor,

23:31.675 --> 23:33.961
which means if we try to move
Chin, the bomb will detonate.

23:33.962 --> 23:35.028
If we try to cut it off,

23:35.029 --> 23:36.430
the bomb will detonate.

23:36.431 --> 23:38.065
How is Hesse controlling it?

23:38.066 --> 23:40.141
With a remote detonator which
requires his thumbprint to work.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.919
So, how do we defuse it?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.258
We cannot defuse it, unless
we meet Hesse's demands.

23:48.143 --> 23:49.829
Spoke to the governor.

23:50.745 --> 23:53.680
What, she's not gonna give us the money?

23:54.549 --> 23:58.085
"We don't negotiate with
terrorists, Daniel."

23:59.688 --> 24:01.321
Her words.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.513
What are we gonna tell our boy?

24:11.007 --> 24:14.096
I guess we're gonna tell him the truth.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.047
Howzit, fellas? What's new?

24:29.784 --> 24:31.685
What's the word, boss?

24:31.686 --> 24:34.788
The ransom money fell through.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.192
Well, I'm not surprised.

24:38.193 --> 24:40.894
But I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't disappointed.

24:40.895 --> 24:42.229
You just need to sit tight, okay?

24:42.230 --> 24:43.931
We're gonna get that thing
off you, I promise.

24:43.932 --> 24:45.766
I don't have much choice, brah.

24:45.767 --> 24:46.734
Chin!

24:46.735 --> 24:48.402
Kono, be careful.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.737
Don't touch him, Kono.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.871
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

24:50.872 --> 24:52.773
What are we doing to get this off of him?

24:52.774 --> 24:54.708
Hesse is demanding $10 million,

24:54.709 --> 24:56.477
and the governor will not play ball.

24:56.478 --> 24:57.778
So we need $10 million?

24:57.779 --> 24:59.079
Yes.

25:04.452 --> 25:06.120
I'm sorry, what's the look here?

25:06.121 --> 25:07.955
You know where to get $10 million?

25:07.956 --> 25:10.290
No, but Chin Ho does.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.891
Kono, don't.

25:12.984 --> 25:15.095
It's the only way to save your life...

25:15.096 --> 25:16.330
Oh...

25:16.331 --> 25:18.766
What did you do, you won,
uh, you won the lottery

25:18.767 --> 25:20.901
and you didn't tell us about it?

25:20.902 --> 25:23.137
She's talking about the
asset forfeiture locker.

25:23.138 --> 25:24.805
At HPD?

25:24.806 --> 25:26.206
They got jewels and stolen cars.

25:26.207 --> 25:28.108
They don't got that kind of money there.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.810
It's not that one, it's another one.

25:29.811 --> 25:31.278
Most cops don't know about it.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.913
It's where they keep the confiscated

25:32.914 --> 25:34.782
drugs and money while suspects await trial,

25:34.783 --> 25:36.950
but this one's only for the big scores.

25:36.951 --> 25:38.819
And they got $10 million in there?

25:39.654 --> 25:44.691
They got $28,567,000 in cash, to be exact.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.430
It's all from one big drug
haul eight years ago.

25:49.431 --> 25:51.365
When the investigation went cold,

25:51.366 --> 25:53.747
all that money just sat there.

25:54.836 --> 25:58.072
Three years ago, $200,000
of it went missing,

25:58.073 --> 26:00.207
and everyone started looking at me.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.775
Why? Why'd they look at you?

26:01.776 --> 26:03.444
Because it was my case.

26:03.445 --> 26:05.779
This is the one I couldn't drop.

26:05.780 --> 26:09.149
Someone framed him to
end the investigation.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.218
First...

26:11.219 --> 26:12.207
They accused him of taking payoffs,

26:12.208 --> 26:14.149
then stealing from the locker.

26:17.225 --> 26:19.193
Okay.

26:19.194 --> 26:21.016
- Where is it? 
- Think about

26:21.017 --> 26:22.314
what you're asking right now.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.531
All right, can we just... Where is it?

26:26.968 --> 26:29.336
Chin, please, this is your life.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.676
It's underneath HPD
headquarters in District 1.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.846
But no matter what you guys
are thinking about doing,

26:38.847 --> 26:40.280
it's not worth it.

26:40.281 --> 26:43.650
Hesse is gonna kill me whether
he gets that $10 million or not.

26:43.651 --> 26:45.319
You know that's true.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.921
Okay, yes, yes...
I'm sure that is his plan,

26:47.922 --> 26:50.791
but with this money, I can
get a face-to-face with him,

26:50.792 --> 26:53.126
and this is the only shot we got.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.864
Chin,

26:56.865 --> 26:59.650
you got to tell me how
to get into that locker.

27:02.030 --> 27:03.437
Everything you need to know

27:03.438 --> 27:05.806
is on a set of blueprints at my house.

27:05.807 --> 27:07.808
Where in your house?

27:07.809 --> 27:09.676
My bedroom, underneath the nightstand.

27:09.677 --> 27:13.234
Move it, and there's a loose floorboard.

27:14.983 --> 27:16.350
All right.

27:16.351 --> 27:17.985
Don't move him.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.415
Hey. You want to talk about
what just happened or no?

27:26.416 --> 27:27.554
That's for later.
We got work to do.

27:27.555 --> 27:29.340
That's for later? 
Ho, ho, ho, all right?

27:29.341 --> 27:31.398
For me, I just want to know,
are we really gonna go

27:31.399 --> 27:33.000
break in to a police safe
and steal drug money?

27:33.001 --> 27:35.235
I know what you're gonna say, all right?
We're cops,

27:35.236 --> 27:36.837
we don't steal, there's got
to be another way to do this.

27:36.838 --> 27:38.705
There's not another way to do this, Danny.
Look around.

27:38.706 --> 27:41.375
- Okay? And by the way, I'm not a cop,
I'm a SEAL. - Okay.

27:41.376 --> 27:43.443
Would you relax? You're getting me wrong.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.012
Okay? Superman, bring it down.

27:45.013 --> 27:46.280
Just a notch, all right?

27:46.281 --> 27:48.782
Our boy's in trouble; we
do what we got to do.

27:48.783 --> 27:50.450
I understand that.
I'm just trying to measure

27:50.451 --> 27:51.885
the level of insanity we're dealing with,

27:51.886 --> 27:52.886
- that's all. High. 
- High.Very high.

27:52.887 --> 27:54.121
- Clearly. 
- Clearly.

27:54.122 --> 27:55.889
- All right? 
- Yes.

28:01.229 --> 28:02.563
Yeah.

28:02.564 --> 28:05.232
Have you chosen a spot to
watch the fireworks from?

28:05.233 --> 28:07.968
Listen, I can get the money, 
all right?

28:07.969 --> 28:10.537
I'm sure your friend will be
happy to hear about that.

28:10.538 --> 28:11.705
I need four hours.

28:11.706 --> 28:12.906
You've got three.

28:12.907 --> 28:15.695
I'll be in touch with
further instructions then.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.324
I got the blueprints.

28:41.102 --> 28:43.337
Look, I know what you're thinking,

28:43.338 --> 28:45.405
but my cousin never took
a dime of that money.

28:45.406 --> 28:47.674
These blueprints are 
a little suspect, no?

28:48.610 --> 28:51.395
After Chin was framed, 
he lost his badge.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.080
He said he kept them 
to protect someone.

28:53.081 --> 28:55.249
I don't know who,
but I believe him.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.706
And now that you know, 
so should you.

28:58.141 --> 28:59.286
All right, listen.

28:59.287 --> 29:00.821
How are we gonna steal this money?

29:00.822 --> 29:02.589
Borrow. Borrow.

29:02.590 --> 29:03.707
Okay, we're gonna borrow $10 million;

29:03.708 --> 29:05.484
we're gonna capture Hesse
during the drop-off,

29:05.485 --> 29:07.744
then I'm gonna return the money
before anyone knows it's missing.

29:07.762 --> 29:09.696
Okay, good. 
Uh, just a question.

29:09.697 --> 29:11.832
Does this super-secret room
have a super-secret entrance?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.333
Yes. It's accessible two ways.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.768
The first is through HPD.

29:14.769 --> 29:17.104
HPD! Beautiful! 
A room full of armed people

29:17.105 --> 29:20.073
who definitely do not want
to help us out, right?

29:21.075 --> 29:23.110
The second one is through here.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.778
A tunnel.

29:24.779 --> 29:27.014
A tunnel? Why is there a tunnel?

29:27.015 --> 29:28.148
It was built by the army
in World War II

29:28.149 --> 29:29.283
to get supplies across the island.

29:29.284 --> 29:30.617
Chin Ho said that after 
he was accused,

29:30.618 --> 29:31.918
the tunnel may have been sealed.

29:32.754 --> 29:34.587
We'll unseal it.

30:20.768 --> 30:22.002
Hello?

30:24.138 --> 30:28.108
May I ask what you're doing
in front of my condo?

30:28.109 --> 30:29.291
Oh, nothing, auntie, we're just,

30:29.292 --> 30:30.577
you know, doing some water stuff.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.979
Water stuff?

30:31.980 --> 30:33.814
Yeah. We'll be done soon, I promise.

30:33.815 --> 30:35.883
We have a neighborhood watch here.

30:35.884 --> 30:38.418
That is... so nice.

30:38.419 --> 30:42.989
Why doesn't your truck have a
city and county sign on it?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.444
You don't seem to work
very hard around here.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.371
I'll call the city and check you out.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.180
Perfect timing.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.319
You got it?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.053
Yeah.

32:06.941 --> 32:08.942
How are you doing, cuz?

32:08.943 --> 32:10.510
Hey. I'm glad you're okay.

32:10.511 --> 32:13.013
I was afraid you were gonna
go and do something stupid.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.849
It's not me. Boss man.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.884
We're gonna go make the drop.

32:17.885 --> 32:19.987
Be careful, Kono.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.522
Yeah.

32:21.861 --> 32:24.224
I cannot be the reason you get hurt.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.561
Besides, your mom would kill me.

32:31.329 --> 32:33.567
We're both gonna walk away from this.

32:35.269 --> 32:37.370
You hear me?

32:41.909 --> 32:44.077
Kono.

32:46.347 --> 32:47.918
Aloha.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.940
Aloha.

33:12.639 --> 33:13.607
Yeah?

33:13.608 --> 33:15.175
Have you got my money?

33:15.176 --> 33:17.811
I do. Why don't you come
down to 'Iolani palace,

33:17.812 --> 33:19.079
we'll do the exchange there.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.480
How about I turn your
man into puzzle pieces?

33:20.481 --> 33:22.649
Wait, wait!

33:22.650 --> 33:25.519
There's a field across
Farrington in Waipahu.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.821
There's a lot of fields in Waipahu.

33:27.822 --> 33:30.423
Oh, you'll see me. 
I'll make sure of it.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.493
Oh, and come alone.

33:33.494 --> 33:35.695
Or your man goes boom.

33:42.136 --> 33:44.085
Did you get that?

33:44.086 --> 33:46.506
Oh, yeah.

34:20.456 --> 34:22.155
Kono. We're here.

35:10.756 --> 35:12.314
That's enough.

35:15.646 --> 35:17.558
Where's Sang Min?

35:17.559 --> 35:19.048
Enjoying his freedom.

35:19.049 --> 35:20.908
He said to say "thanks," by the way.

35:22.253 --> 35:23.949
I'll find him.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.952
You're a confident fellow, Steve.

35:26.953 --> 35:28.587
I like that.

35:28.588 --> 35:29.661
In fact, I was counting on that.

35:29.662 --> 35:31.466
Did you bring the money?

35:32.872 --> 35:35.044
Yeah, I brought the money.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.829
Deactivate the bomb.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.234
Let me see the money first.

36:02.924 --> 36:05.857
No! No! Hesse!

36:08.276 --> 36:10.529
The money for Chin Ho's life.

36:10.530 --> 36:11.763
That was the deal.

36:11.764 --> 36:13.832
This was never about the money, Steve.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.000
This is about honor.

36:15.001 --> 36:16.820
It's about unfinished business.

36:16.821 --> 36:18.583
This is about looking into your eyes

36:18.584 --> 36:20.209
when I kill a man who serves under you,

36:20.210 --> 36:23.484
a man that you are responsible for.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.452
You told me you didn't
care about getting even.

36:25.453 --> 36:27.734
I lied.

36:27.735 --> 36:29.347
Now!

38:16.170 --> 38:17.389
What did the governor say?

38:18.156 --> 38:20.726
She's kind of pissed about Sang Min.

38:20.727 --> 38:22.561
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

38:22.562 --> 38:24.930
I just told her that it's one of those

38:24.931 --> 38:26.332
glass-half-full kinds of moments.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.767
You know? I mean, yes,
Sang Min is on the lam,

38:28.768 --> 38:30.102
but Victor Hesse is locked up,

38:30.103 --> 38:31.670
and he's not gonna see the outside

38:31.671 --> 38:33.239
of Halawa Correctional
in this lifetime, so...

38:33.240 --> 38:35.441
What about the money?

38:36.243 --> 38:37.710
I didn't tell her.

38:37.711 --> 38:39.245
Huh? What was that?

38:39.246 --> 38:40.546
I didn't tell her.

38:40.547 --> 38:41.952
Ah.

38:41.953 --> 38:44.116
Good. So, you-you do have ten million

38:44.117 --> 38:46.685
stashed away somewhere to
pay that cash back, right?

38:48.722 --> 38:52.291
Danny, that money's been on
ice for over eight years.

38:52.292 --> 38:54.360
Okay, nobody's going to
notice that it's missing.

38:54.361 --> 38:57.830
So, what if this cold case
turns into a hot case again,

38:57.831 --> 38:59.465
and someone wants to go in
there and count that cash?

38:59.466 --> 39:01.734
What do you think is
going to happen to you?

39:01.735 --> 39:03.235
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

39:03.236 --> 39:04.970
I know the answer. You go to jail.

39:04.971 --> 39:06.472
I'm not gonna go to jail, okay?

39:06.473 --> 39:08.240
- Okay, maybe I got to jail. 
- Yeah, maybe.

39:08.241 --> 39:10.242
Right now, Chin Ho is alive, 
okay?

39:10.243 --> 39:12.111
Why can't we just celebrate that win?

39:12.112 --> 39:14.079
We'll figure the rest out tomorrow.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.981
You just better start buying
some lottery tickets.

39:15.982 --> 39:17.383
That's all I'm saying.

39:17.384 --> 39:19.852
And you better start prepping
that sleigh, Tubsy, okay?

39:19.853 --> 39:21.120
It's almost Christmas Eve.

39:21.121 --> 39:22.454
I'll drive.

39:22.455 --> 39:23.889
Can I ask you a question?

39:23.890 --> 39:26.158
Why are you always driving my car?

39:27.494 --> 39:28.794
I like to drive.

39:28.795 --> 39:30.296
No, no, no. Rainman likes to drive.

39:30.297 --> 39:32.398
You have control issues.

39:53.453 --> 39:55.521
Ow!

39:55.522 --> 39:57.990
You learn to sew in the SEALs?

39:58.825 --> 40:00.826
I learned to sew in the boy scouts.

40:00.827 --> 40:02.094
Why am I not surprised?

40:02.095 --> 40:04.196
- Why is it a big deal I can sew?
- I see a limo.

40:04.197 --> 40:05.210
Guys, she's here.

40:13.506 --> 40:14.940
Come on.

40:16.309 --> 40:19.211
Hey, Grace. Hi!

40:19.212 --> 40:21.647
Mele Kalikimaka!

40:21.648 --> 40:24.216
"Merry Christmas," please.

40:24.217 --> 40:25.718
Who's that? Did you hear that?

40:25.719 --> 40:27.519
Ho!

40:27.520 --> 40:28.787
Ho. Ho.

40:28.788 --> 40:29.989
Ho. Santa!

40:29.990 --> 40:32.291
Oh! Yes, it is Santa.

40:32.292 --> 40:33.559
Oh!

40:33.560 --> 40:35.527
Merry Christmas.

40:35.528 --> 40:36.929
Looks like you lost some weight.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.997
Just a little bit. Come here.

40:45.666 --> 40:47.933
What did you get me? Any presents?

41:48.470 --> 41:50.705
Wo fat,

41:50.706 --> 41:52.707
what are you doing here?

41:52.708 --> 41:55.276
I have a question for you,

41:55.277 --> 41:57.745
one I needed to ask in person.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.548
What is it?

42:00.549 --> 42:02.116
How much does Steve McGarrett know

42:02.117 --> 42:03.751
about what his father was investigating

42:03.752 --> 42:05.319
before you killed him?

42:08.056 --> 42:10.257
How close is he to the truth?

42:11.393 --> 42:17.831
Um... too close.

42:20.502 --> 42:22.803
Well...

42:22.804 --> 42:24.972
We can't have that now, can we?
