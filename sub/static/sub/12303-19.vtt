01:01.670 --> 01:03.204
All right, ladies!

01:03.271 --> 01:04.804
Everyone up!

01:04.870 --> 01:08.004
On your feet now! Up!
Everyone out of the water!

01:08.071 --> 01:10.770
Move it! Move!
On your feet!

01:10.837 --> 01:13.837
<i>( women screaming )
Now! Let's go!</i>

01:13.904 --> 01:15.904
Move now! Let's go!

01:15.971 --> 01:18.637
Hold it! Down on the ground,
right now! Do it!

01:27.271 --> 01:30.371
All right, everybody through
being heroes now, huh?!

01:30.438 --> 01:31.704
Move it!

01:31.770 --> 01:33.470
Everyone in the lockers!

01:39.570 --> 01:41.603
Come on now!
Get in there now!

01:41.670 --> 01:45.804
I want those lockers
open now!

01:45.870 --> 01:48.837
I want your purses in my bag
and your keys in my hand!

01:48.904 --> 01:50.603
Hurry it up!
Give me that.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.704
Come on. Let's go.

01:52.770 --> 01:53.837
You, where's your keys?

01:53.904 --> 01:56.670
Oh...
Hurry up!

01:56.737 --> 01:57.637
Come on. Hurry up!

02:12.204 --> 02:15.503
Somebody... help me, please.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.271
I've been shot.

02:18.971 --> 02:20.338
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

02:20.404 --> 02:22.503
We got 'em. We got 'em.
Let's go. Let's go.

02:32.904 --> 02:34.004
The keys...
Come on!

02:35.603 --> 02:39.004
Which one goes to which car?

02:47.704 --> 02:49.770
Frank?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.371
Three men in masks,
armed robbery.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.137
Weird thing is,
they weren't even armed

02:54.204 --> 02:56.371
before they took the gun
off the security guard.

02:56.438 --> 02:58.204
Dispatch says shots fired,
Frank.

02:58.271 --> 03:01.104
Yeah. Victoria Morena
fought back with OC spray.

03:01.171 --> 03:02.770
Took one in the chest
for it.

03:02.837 --> 03:04.137
She had pepper spray.

03:04.204 --> 03:05.971
Yeah, which means one
of our guys has got Mace face.

03:06.037 --> 03:07.271
When we find him,
we'll know it.

03:07.338 --> 03:09.037
And all the hospitals
have been contacted.

03:09.104 --> 03:10.271
How's she doing?

03:10.338 --> 03:11.870
She's, uh, hanging
in there for now.

03:11.937 --> 03:13.204
She's with
the paramedics.

03:13.271 --> 03:15.037
You're going
to be okay.

03:16.371 --> 03:18.937
All right, witnesses?

03:21.204 --> 03:22.603
What's going on?

03:22.670 --> 03:25.271
Horatio, there's something
you ought to know.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.503
She's okay, but, uh,
one of the witnesses is Marisol.

03:30.737 --> 03:32.770
CAINE:
Give us a minute, please.
Will you?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.071
Marisol...

03:34.137 --> 03:37.937
The one day I decide
to pamper myself, right?

03:38.004 --> 03:39.470
Marisol, I don't like
the look of that.

03:39.537 --> 03:40.971
I'm going to send you
to the hospital

03:41.037 --> 03:42.603
and have you
checked out.
No, I'm fine.

03:42.670 --> 03:43.637
I... I just fell.

03:43.704 --> 03:45.904
Marisol, what happened?

03:45.971 --> 03:47.204
I don't know.

03:47.271 --> 03:49.004
It... just happened so fast.

03:49.071 --> 03:51.338
They were just suddenly there,
and...

03:51.404 --> 03:55.304
I keep seeing them--
you know, those masks.

03:55.371 --> 03:57.937
<i>Let's go!
( women screaming )</i>

03:58.004 --> 03:59.204
Move!

04:00.837 --> 04:03.837
Horatio,
you get them. Okay?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.204
I will.

05:00.674 --> 05:03.040
Horatio, looks like cars
were the focus.

05:03.107 --> 05:05.307
The type of rides parked
outside this place

05:05.374 --> 05:06.574
was like an invitation.

05:06.641 --> 05:07.707
What'd they get, Frank?

05:07.774 --> 05:09.641
Lambo, Viper,
Aston Martin.

05:09.707 --> 05:11.507
Not bad for a day's work.

05:11.574 --> 05:15.441
The good news is these exotic
cars all had tracking devices.

05:15.507 --> 05:17.507
CAINE:
Okay, put out
a broadcast.

05:17.574 --> 05:18.574
DELKO:
H! Hey, H!

05:18.641 --> 05:20.741
Where's my sister?

05:20.808 --> 05:22.240
She's at the hospital.
She's going to be fine.

05:22.307 --> 05:23.541
What happened?

05:23.607 --> 05:24.707
She's got a gash over the eye,

05:24.774 --> 05:25.874
and I think she may
have a concussion,

05:25.940 --> 05:27.040
but she's going to be fine.

05:27.107 --> 05:28.040
I'm going to the hospital.

05:28.107 --> 05:30.073
Eric, she's going to be okay.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.841
I need you here.

05:31.908 --> 05:34.774
I'll call you from the hospital
when I get something.

05:46.274 --> 05:47.874
You guys detectives?
CSIs.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.374
Found something
weird on the victim

05:49.441 --> 05:50.940
you should
know about.
What's that?

05:51.007 --> 05:52.574
Blood spray
around her mouth.

05:52.641 --> 05:54.707
What's weird about that?
Someone gave her CPR?

05:54.774 --> 05:57.140
MAN:
One, two, three, four...

05:59.040 --> 06:00.474
It was there
when we found her.

06:00.541 --> 06:02.874
Maybe a civilian revived her.

06:02.940 --> 06:03.874
Did a good job, too.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.040
It's why she's alive.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.973
I wonder why they
didn't say anything.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.407
Maybe they helped her
out of guilt.

06:08.474 --> 06:09.541
You think whoever helped her

06:09.607 --> 06:10.707
could be involved
in the robbery?

06:10.774 --> 06:12.541
I'll ask around
and find out.

06:12.607 --> 06:14.240
I'm going to go inside
and look for a casing.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.707
PARAMEDIC:
Might find
a bullet, too.

06:15.774 --> 06:17.407
Her wound's
a through-
and-through.

06:18.374 --> 06:19.707
Thanks.

06:22.541 --> 06:23.808
Excuse me, guys.

06:23.874 --> 06:25.441
I need to talk to you
for a second.

06:25.507 --> 06:27.073
Oh, yeah, sure.
What's up?

06:27.140 --> 06:28.808
Well, thanks for saving
the victim's life.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.674
The blood on your shirt--
you gave her CPR, right?

06:32.741 --> 06:34.674
Oh, yeah.

06:34.741 --> 06:36.574
Uh, my pleasure.

06:36.641 --> 06:37.973
Just glad
I could help.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.474
Just I'm curious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?

06:40.541 --> 06:43.240
She dies,
I get sued.

06:43.307 --> 06:46.274
I understand. No good deed
goes unpunished, right?

06:46.340 --> 06:48.140
Yeah, something like that.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.808
So are we done here?

06:49.874 --> 06:51.808
No, no, no, actually,
we're just...

06:51.874 --> 06:53.040
we're just getting started.

07:14.841 --> 07:16.808
Found you.

07:24.073 --> 07:26.541
I'm, I'm confused, uh...

07:26.607 --> 07:29.040
Pete.
Pete.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.973
No men are allowed
in the women's pool area, right,

07:31.040 --> 07:32.307
not even a massage therapist?

07:32.374 --> 07:35.774
Well... no.

07:35.841 --> 07:38.441
You walked in
after the shooting,

07:38.507 --> 07:40.674
past the sauna where the women
were held, right?

07:40.741 --> 07:41.741
That's right.

07:41.808 --> 07:43.307
How come no one saw you?

07:43.374 --> 07:46.107
Because he came
from the closet.

07:47.307 --> 07:48.374
I found the a peephole
in the wall.

07:58.741 --> 08:00.808
You involved in this, Pete?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.340
You let these men in?

08:04.407 --> 08:05.674
No. No way.

08:05.741 --> 08:06.874
I... just...

08:09.140 --> 08:13.741
I watch. That's it.

08:13.808 --> 08:14.874
I don't believe you.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.107
Why not?

08:16.174 --> 08:17.940
Because you lied to me
already twice.

08:19.641 --> 08:22.174
Let's go.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.506
Hey.
Got something?

08:32.573 --> 08:33.841
Yeah. Cooper called.

08:33.908 --> 08:35.841
He accessed
the Viper's GPS unit,

08:35.908 --> 08:38.841
and it's transmitting
from the pier of Miami.

08:38.908 --> 08:40.107
So you think the carjackers

08:40.174 --> 08:41.573
are getting ready to ship it
overseas?

08:41.640 --> 08:43.039
Yeah, looks that way.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.207
I'm going to grab Cooper
in the mobile track unit.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.407
We're going to
find out for sure.

08:45.474 --> 08:47.507
<i>( phone beeping )
All right.</i>

08:47.574 --> 08:49.107
It's Tripp.

08:49.174 --> 08:51.073
Great.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.973
Detain him
till somebody can pick up him.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.607
All right.

08:54.674 --> 08:57.240
Got a guy trying to check
himself into Miami General.

08:57.307 --> 08:58.741
Guess what he got.

08:58.808 --> 09:00.274
Mace burn.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.240
Bingo.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.808
Great. Let's divide and conquer.

09:03.874 --> 09:06.207
Well, that's
gotta hurt.

09:06.274 --> 09:07.874
I got stung by a bee.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.040
It's nothing really.

09:10.107 --> 09:12.374
Enough to get you
in Miami General Hospital.

09:12.441 --> 09:14.240
Yeah, I'm allergic.

09:14.307 --> 09:15.940
But not to bees;
to pepper spray.

09:16.007 --> 09:17.407
Where are your keys?!

09:17.474 --> 09:18.908
You!

09:18.973 --> 09:20.174
Come on. Hurry up!

09:27.841 --> 09:30.841
You robbed the spa this morning,
Billy.

09:30.908 --> 09:33.940
No idea what you're
talking about.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.574
We're talking
about where you got this.

09:36.641 --> 09:39.841
We found it parked around
the corner of the hospital.
It's an Astin Martin

09:39.908 --> 09:43.307
That's a pretty nice car.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.641
It ain't mine, though.

09:44.707 --> 09:46.007
Empty your pockets.

09:48.073 --> 09:50.107
Empty your pockets, Billy.

10:04.107 --> 10:05.340
Well, I guess that clears up
the car thing

10:05.407 --> 10:06.774
since you've got the keys.

10:06.841 --> 10:08.507
CAINE:
And the zip ties
that were used

10:08.574 --> 10:11.374
to bind the security guard
at the spa.

10:11.441 --> 10:12.808
I didn't hurt anybody.

10:12.874 --> 10:14.808
Who are your friends,
Mr. Robinson?

10:14.874 --> 10:17.073
Look, we were just supposed
to tie up the guard, okay?

10:17.140 --> 10:18.641
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

10:18.707 --> 10:21.207
But they did get hurt, Billy,
didn't they?

10:21.274 --> 10:23.007
Witnesses said
the guy

10:23.073 --> 10:24.441
that got Maced
didn't shoot anyone,

10:24.507 --> 10:25.874
so do yourself a favor

10:25.940 --> 10:27.107
and tell us who did.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.374
I can't.

10:29.707 --> 10:31.407
It's better to be in jail
than dead.

10:31.474 --> 10:33.607
Then jail it is.

10:44.874 --> 10:47.641
Be advised: we followed
the GPS unit of our Viper

10:47.707 --> 10:49.607
to the Lion's Gate Shipyard
on Pike Street.

10:49.674 --> 10:51.641
We're requesting backup, please.
Thank you.

10:51.707 --> 10:52.641
Uh-oh.

10:52.707 --> 10:53.874
WOLFE:
What?

10:55.641 --> 10:57.474
Signal's moving.

10:57.541 --> 10:58.674
Okay, so are we.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.307
Wait. You gotta
stay here, man.

11:00.374 --> 11:01.374
No way.

11:01.441 --> 11:02.741
Cooper, you're unarmed.

11:02.808 --> 11:04.374
Hey, you brought me out here,

11:04.441 --> 11:06.340
<i>and somebody's gotta
to read the receiver.</i>

11:06.407 --> 11:08.073
Okay. Hang back.

11:33.007 --> 11:34.641
Signal's on the move again.

11:37.307 --> 11:38.707
No way.

11:38.774 --> 11:40.908
<i>Hey, ( whistles ) stop.</i>

11:40.973 --> 11:43.007
Is that the GPS unit?

11:43.073 --> 11:45.073
They took the damn thing
out of the Viper.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.973
I feel stupid.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.874
They could be the stupid ones.
It could give us something.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.841
Let's get back
to the lab.

11:53.441 --> 11:54.808
<i>MAN ( over radio ):
Patrols rolling Code 3</i>

11:54.874 --> 11:58.073
<i>in pursuit
of a 2005 Lamborghini, orange,</i>

11:58.140 --> 12:03.507
<i>Florida license 16W649,
heading southbound on I-95.</i>

12:25.507 --> 12:27.441
I swear I didn't even
see you guys.

12:27.507 --> 12:30.973
You know, the sun
and my music was blasting.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.741
You got an excuse
for going 150 miles an hour?

12:36.874 --> 12:39.607
Too much caffeine?

12:39.674 --> 12:41.340
What about for shooting
Victoria Morena?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.674
What?
What are you talking about?

12:44.741 --> 12:46.073
Talking about
where'd you get

12:46.140 --> 12:48.174
the Lamborghini
from, Andretti?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.007
It's Hayden.
Hayden Cruise.

12:51.274 --> 12:53.674
And I got the car
from my car guy.

12:53.741 --> 12:56.307
He's been looking
for a Lambo for, like
two months for me.

12:56.374 --> 12:57.641
Your car guy?

12:57.707 --> 12:59.908
Yeah, Joe. You can
call him if you want.

12:59.973 --> 13:01.407
Speed dial 11.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.207
The number you are trying
to reach has been disconnected

13:05.274 --> 13:06.707
or is no longer in service.

13:06.774 --> 13:08.908
That's shocking.

13:08.973 --> 13:10.507
It's disconnected.

13:10.574 --> 13:12.073
What?

13:12.140 --> 13:15.973
Hey, look, these cars
are like organs, you know?

13:16.040 --> 13:17.073
You get on a list,
you wait.

13:17.140 --> 13:18.674
And then when they call,
you buy it.

13:18.741 --> 13:20.574
Otherwise,
somebody else will.

13:20.641 --> 13:22.774
And you didn't think
the car was maybe stolen?

13:22.841 --> 13:24.140
No, absolutely not.

13:24.207 --> 13:27.040
You got a last name

13:27.107 --> 13:28.874
for this Joe guy?

13:30.908 --> 13:34.940
No. But I gave him, like,
a hundred grand cash.

13:35.007 --> 13:37.207
It's a big chunk
of my trust fund.

13:37.274 --> 13:41.240
That big chunk's
about to be impounded, Hayden.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.374
Hey, if you
catch this guy,

13:45.441 --> 13:47.574
do I get my money back or what?

13:47.641 --> 13:49.140
Look, a woman was shot today.

13:49.207 --> 13:51.441
I'm sorry.

13:51.507 --> 13:54.574
It's just, it's
a lot of money.

13:54.641 --> 13:56.741
Get his car keys.

14:02.774 --> 14:05.107
I heard we recovered
all three stolen cars.

14:05.174 --> 14:06.107
Is that right?

14:06.174 --> 14:07.441
Two and a half.

14:07.507 --> 14:09.441
Got the bait and switch
at the shipyard.

14:09.507 --> 14:12.374
All that was left of the Viper
was the tracking device.

14:12.441 --> 14:14.140
You mean
they chopped it.

14:14.207 --> 14:15.507
Yeah, problem is

14:15.574 --> 14:16.908
it looks like they used
an acetylene torch,

14:16.973 --> 14:18.607
and heat doesn't leave
a tool mark.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.874
But the torch
would make it
too hot to handle.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.674
Think he used
something to hold it?

14:35.507 --> 14:36.774
He used a vise grip.

14:45.607 --> 14:48.107
And imperfections can make
a unique match.

14:48.174 --> 14:51.407
I'm going to Impound
to look at recently
chopped cars

14:51.474 --> 14:53.340
to compare tool marks.

14:53.407 --> 14:54.841
Meet me
at the garage.

15:02.574 --> 15:04.407
This one's barely a car.

15:04.474 --> 15:07.040
Better for us. Frame's exposed.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.307
Hey, hand me the magnifier,
would you?

15:19.207 --> 15:20.741
I think I got something.
Hand me the picture

15:20.808 --> 15:23.107
of the GPS from the Viper.

15:29.274 --> 15:30.607
Who's the proud illegal owner

15:30.674 --> 15:33.140
of these tool marks?

15:33.207 --> 15:37.541
This ring was run
by Carvell Watson.

15:37.607 --> 15:41.507
His case is pending
for chopping cars.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.774
He's probably out on bail.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.674
We can change that.

15:44.741 --> 15:47.407
I'll get you an address.

15:55.541 --> 15:56.474
Hi,
Hey.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.707
how you doing?

15:57.774 --> 15:58.908
Good.

15:58.973 --> 16:00.741
What can I do for you?

16:00.808 --> 16:02.274
Save my life, I hope.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.607
I, uh, got a new car

16:03.674 --> 16:05.240
and I kinda had
a little accident.

16:05.307 --> 16:07.541
Yeah? What kind of car is it?

16:07.607 --> 16:09.507
A Viper SRT.

16:09.574 --> 16:11.707
And what's the damage?

16:11.774 --> 16:14.674
Well, the driver side door
is smushed in.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.874
I can't
even open it.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.140
I called the dealer
about getting

16:17.207 --> 16:18.908
a new one, but they're,
like, five grand.

16:18.973 --> 16:22.073
We might have something for you.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.874
Let me go get the owner.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.374
Thanks.

16:28.940 --> 16:30.140
MAN:
How you doing?

16:30.207 --> 16:32.040
Fine, thanks.

16:32.107 --> 16:33.107
You're lucky.

16:33.174 --> 16:35.340
Got a couple Viper doors
in today.

16:35.407 --> 16:37.808
I bet you did.

16:39.407 --> 16:40.774
Keep your hands

16:40.841 --> 16:42.307
where I can see 'em,
Mr. Watson.

16:44.874 --> 16:46.374
What now?

16:46.441 --> 16:48.240
I'm going to call for a warrant.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.140
I'll let you know
in about two minutes.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.340
Victoria Morena.

16:59.407 --> 17:02.274
Her heart suffered
too much trauma.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.207
She died of cardiac arrest.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.040
Bullets will do that
to you.

17:07.107 --> 17:10.207
So we go from robbery to murder.

17:10.273 --> 17:12.940
Witnesses said
the shooter kicked
her in the head.

17:13.007 --> 17:15.339
Have Delko look
for trace.

17:16.808 --> 17:19.641
The woman you shot this morning
just died, Carvell,

17:19.707 --> 17:21.040
so you're looking at murder.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.574
I didn't shoot anyone.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.540
Somebody's trying
to set me up.

17:24.607 --> 17:26.773
Here's some proof.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.374
Here's a photograph
of the door

17:28.441 --> 17:31.107
from the stolen vehicle
from the women's day spa

17:31.174 --> 17:32.808
where there was an armed
robbery this morning.

17:32.874 --> 17:34.541
It was at your shop.

17:34.607 --> 17:36.741
You received stolen
property.

17:36.808 --> 17:38.474
I had no idea
they were stolen.

17:38.541 --> 17:39.641
What about these purses

17:39.707 --> 17:42.973
from the women
at the spa?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.940
What about 'em?
We found 'em

17:45.007 --> 17:46.607
in the dumpster
behind your store.

17:46.674 --> 17:47.841
Come on.

17:47.908 --> 17:50.307
Everyone at the shop
uses that trash can.

17:50.374 --> 17:51.774
Everybody else checks out.

17:51.841 --> 17:53.073
This is crazy.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.641
I told you
I'm being messed with!

17:54.707 --> 17:57.841
You know, I feel exactly
the same way.

17:57.908 --> 17:59.240
Book him.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.737
Is that Victoria?

18:59.804 --> 19:00.771
Who are you?

19:00.837 --> 19:02.070
I'm her husband.

19:02.137 --> 19:05.938
Look, Mr. Morena,
you shouldn't be here.

19:06.004 --> 19:07.170
What are you
doing to her?

19:07.237 --> 19:09.070
I know that this
is upsetting, okay,

19:09.137 --> 19:10.971
but we have to process
your wife's body.

19:11.038 --> 19:12.470
Hasn't she been
through enough already?

19:12.537 --> 19:15.437
I want to catch the man
that did this to your wife

19:15.504 --> 19:16.804
and this is going to help.

19:20.370 --> 19:23.170
I was at the hospital with her.

19:23.237 --> 19:24.971
She was stable.

19:25.038 --> 19:28.038
I left Maria
for an hour.

19:28.103 --> 19:33.337
And when I returned, she...

19:35.804 --> 19:36.804
Look, I'm sorry.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.203
I should have been there.

19:39.270 --> 19:44.270
Please, just wait outside
in the lobby, okay?

19:44.337 --> 19:46.637
I promise
I'll take good care of her.

20:03.837 --> 20:05.203
The results on the trace
I pulled

20:05.270 --> 20:06.270
from the victim's hair.

20:06.337 --> 20:08.504
Just printed up.

20:08.571 --> 20:09.804
I don't mean
to criticize,

20:09.871 --> 20:13.203
but what took you
so long to collect it?

20:13.270 --> 20:14.837
You can't process
a victim's body

20:14.904 --> 20:16.270
until they're dead.

20:16.337 --> 20:17.370
Got it.

20:17.437 --> 20:21.470
So, I got C12,
H22 and O11.

20:21.537 --> 20:22.871
That's sucrose.

20:22.938 --> 20:25.470
Add dithiocarbamate
and you got a sugar mill.

20:25.537 --> 20:26.737
Yeah. Great.

20:26.804 --> 20:28.504
How many of those
are there in Miami?

20:28.571 --> 20:31.237
Only one with
a high concentration
of potassium carbamate.

20:31.304 --> 20:32.537
You lost me.

20:32.604 --> 20:34.470
It's the chemical
composition of wood ash.

20:36.370 --> 20:37.871
The fire at the Sullivan
sugar mill.

20:37.938 --> 20:39.270
Three weeks ago.

20:39.337 --> 20:42.437
That's enough time
to put in a chop shop.

21:07.038 --> 21:08.837
There's the Viper.

21:08.904 --> 21:10.604
Damn, they can do
a lot in a few hours.

21:10.671 --> 21:12.038
Surgical strip.

21:12.103 --> 21:14.504
I've seen cars completely pieced
out in under two hours.

21:23.370 --> 21:25.137
Here we go.

21:25.203 --> 21:27.904
MDPD! Down, everybody down!

21:27.971 --> 21:29.837
Hands on your head!

21:42.704 --> 21:44.103
Ryan!

21:53.904 --> 21:57.237
H, I-I don't know what happened.

21:57.304 --> 21:58.337
Mr. Wolfe, you didn't
have the shot.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.437
I-I just froze.

22:00.504 --> 22:03.237
Mr. Wolfe, you didn't have
the shot, you understand?

22:04.938 --> 22:06.604
I understand.

22:28.370 --> 22:31.437
You want to walk me through it?

22:31.504 --> 22:34.237
I staged at the door.

22:34.304 --> 22:37.871
Two suspects visible.

22:37.938 --> 22:41.038
I made entry.

22:41.103 --> 22:43.004
You ID yourselves?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.170
Yeah.

22:44.237 --> 22:46.137
Announced on entry.

22:46.203 --> 22:48.804
Badges were clearly in view.

22:48.871 --> 22:50.704
Go on.

22:53.637 --> 22:55.737
I approached one guy
to pat him down...

22:55.804 --> 22:58.504
next thing I know

22:58.571 --> 23:00.470
another guy come out
of nowhere with a gauge.

23:00.537 --> 23:02.038
Your weapon's drawn?

23:02.103 --> 23:04.804
Yeah.

23:04.871 --> 23:07.070
Well, you perceived a threat?

23:07.137 --> 23:08.804
Yeah.

23:08.871 --> 23:10.771
In Horatio's interview
he said that, uh,

23:10.837 --> 23:13.604
you didn't have a clear shot;
is that what happened?

23:15.904 --> 23:18.504
Ryan...

23:18.571 --> 23:20.304
is that what happened?

23:23.203 --> 23:26.103
Yeah, that's right.

23:31.237 --> 23:34.504
Pepper spray
has a UV marking dye.

23:34.571 --> 23:37.571
If this guy was near his buddy
when he got shot, we'll know it.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.103
There it is, H.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.771
So he was there.

23:44.837 --> 23:46.337
Come on, hurry up!

23:46.404 --> 23:48.137
Oh, God!

23:50.470 --> 23:51.604
Yeah.

23:51.671 --> 23:53.337
Now we got
two out of three,

23:53.404 --> 23:55.038
but he's not
our shooter.

23:55.103 --> 23:57.737
Witnesses said the shooter stood
about five feet from the others.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.971
<i>If he was standing
that far away,</i>

24:00.038 --> 24:01.938
<i>he wouldn't get hit
by pepper spray.</i>

24:05.938 --> 24:08.637
So we've got one more to go.

24:13.804 --> 24:16.804
Listen, we just went
through the purses

24:16.871 --> 24:18.203
from the dumpster.

24:18.270 --> 24:19.671
Credit cards are there,
but the IDs are missing.

24:19.737 --> 24:21.604
I know car thieves
don't change their MO,

24:21.671 --> 24:23.837
but they've got keys
and addresses.

24:23.904 --> 24:25.771
Eric, we are talking
about home invasion.

24:25.837 --> 24:26.904
Should I send cars?

24:26.971 --> 24:28.604
Send one to every house.
Done.

24:58.370 --> 24:59.404
Ma'am.

24:59.470 --> 25:01.604
Ma'am, it's okay.

25:01.671 --> 25:02.904
<i>( sobbing ):
That man...</i>

25:02.971 --> 25:04.837
It was the same man.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.170
The one from this
morning at the spa.

25:07.237 --> 25:09.504
Did you see his face?

25:09.571 --> 25:11.137
No.

25:11.203 --> 25:13.270
He had that mask.

25:13.337 --> 25:16.103
But it was him, his voice.

25:16.170 --> 25:19.137
The one who shot that girl.

25:19.203 --> 25:20.938
Okay, I want you
to try and relax.

25:21.004 --> 25:23.070
<i>( sobbing ):
My friends...</i>

25:23.137 --> 25:26.103
All my friends...
You have to do something.

25:26.170 --> 25:28.004
Everyone from the spa is safe.

25:28.070 --> 25:30.237
No, no, he took my Blackberry.

25:30.304 --> 25:33.070
He said all my rich friends
were gonna get it.

25:33.137 --> 25:35.170
TRIPP:
Horatio.

25:35.237 --> 25:37.237
Paramedics are here.

25:37.304 --> 25:39.103
What have you got?

25:39.170 --> 25:42.270
We, uh, we got patrol cars at
all the other ladies' homes,

25:42.337 --> 25:43.537
including Marisol's.

25:43.604 --> 25:44.837
It's not gonna be
enough, Frank.

25:44.904 --> 25:46.038
Why not?

25:46.103 --> 25:47.737
He's got her PDA
and all her contacts.

25:47.804 --> 25:49.304
That's too many to cover.

25:49.370 --> 25:51.070
No way we can protect everyone.

25:51.137 --> 25:52.571
That's exactly
what he's counting on.

26:19.187 --> 26:20.887
So I guess this eliminates
Carvell, right?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.254
'Cause he was in custody
when all this went down.

26:23.321 --> 26:26.654
So who the hell is this guy?

26:26.720 --> 26:30.820
I've never seen
a GTA escalate to houses.

26:30.887 --> 26:32.487
Whoever he is, he's desperate.

26:32.553 --> 26:34.587
That's the worst kind.

26:34.654 --> 26:36.987
Damn.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.921
No print?

26:38.987 --> 26:41.820
No, I've got ridge detail,
but nothing makeable.

26:41.887 --> 26:46.854
But ridge detail means
that he wasn't wearing gloves.

26:46.921 --> 26:48.987
That's right--
epithelials on the rope.

26:56.021 --> 26:57.687
That's good.

26:57.754 --> 27:00.420
We'll get it to DNA.

27:14.887 --> 27:16.453
Hey, you got any
results on that rope?

27:16.520 --> 27:17.587
Almost.

27:20.354 --> 27:22.187
Look, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

27:22.254 --> 27:23.787
I didn't mean to be rude.

27:23.854 --> 27:25.354
Whatever.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.388
You know what? I was just
really worried about Marisol.

27:27.453 --> 27:28.587
And not everything is something.

27:28.654 --> 27:30.687
No, I know that.
It's just that...

27:30.754 --> 27:33.087
Got a hit on the DNA
from the rope.

27:33.154 --> 27:34.720
Prior B&E.

27:34.787 --> 27:35.987
Javier Morena.

27:36.054 --> 27:39.254
Let me see that.

27:43.388 --> 27:46.987
Isn't that the spa
victim's last name?

27:47.054 --> 27:49.687
Yeah. It is.

27:57.787 --> 28:00.487
I can't believe
I felt sorry for you.

28:00.553 --> 28:03.021
For God's sake,
I didn't kill my wife.

28:03.087 --> 28:05.787
I must say,
it was a good cover-up.

28:05.854 --> 28:07.087
The whole robbery thing.

28:07.154 --> 28:08.687
Look, I wish you'd listen to me.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.087
I was never near that spa.

28:10.154 --> 28:12.054
What about
Cynthia Gilmore's house, huh?

28:12.121 --> 28:14.021
How you gonna lie
about that, Javier?

28:14.087 --> 28:16.553
We have your DNA.

28:20.553 --> 28:22.787
All right, I've been
to Cynthia's house.

28:22.854 --> 28:25.254
But I wasn't there to hurt her.

28:25.321 --> 28:27.453
What, tying her up
and scaring her to death,

28:27.520 --> 28:29.520
that was for what, for pleasure?

28:29.587 --> 28:32.887
Yeah, I tied her up.
But not this morning.

28:32.954 --> 28:36.453
And I swear it was consensual.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.254
So you're having an affair.

28:39.321 --> 28:41.254
You want proof, I got pictures.

28:41.321 --> 28:45.754
Well, hey, that's a perfect
motive for killing your wife.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.854
Look, I'm telling you.
I didn't kill Victoria.

28:49.388 --> 28:51.787
Come on, man.
Our sex life was, uh...

28:53.520 --> 28:54.987
But... but I loved her.

28:55.054 --> 28:57.087
Don't even. Don't even.

28:57.154 --> 28:59.787
I'm sorry.

28:59.854 --> 29:02.654
You should be.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.321
What's his story?

29:06.388 --> 29:08.921
He says he was S&M buddies
with Cynthia Gilmore.

29:08.987 --> 29:10.354
Victim of the home invasion?

29:10.420 --> 29:12.021
Well, it doesn't

29:12.087 --> 29:14.520
eliminate him
as a suspect in our shooting.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.954
Yeah, well, we need proof.

29:17.021 --> 29:19.754
Let's start by confirming
their relationship with Cynthia.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.354
We won't have to.

29:21.420 --> 29:22.754
He says he has pictures.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.354
Pictures.

29:28.021 --> 29:29.354
What are you thinking?

29:29.420 --> 29:31.520
I just got an idea.

29:36.388 --> 29:38.520
Is this everything?

29:38.587 --> 29:40.154
I guess Peeping Pete
travels light.

29:40.221 --> 29:42.921
You want to tell me why I got
all this stuff out of booking?

29:42.987 --> 29:44.654
Voyeurs like to document,

29:44.720 --> 29:47.121
so I'm thinking he might have
pictures of the spa crime scene.

29:47.187 --> 29:48.954
Tripp says he checked this one.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.321
It's not
a camera phone.

29:53.254 --> 29:55.154
Wait a minute.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.154
This is a pretty big pen

29:59.221 --> 30:01.520
for a massage therapist
to carry around.

30:01.587 --> 30:03.221
Is there a hole
in the side of it?

30:07.021 --> 30:08.654
It has a lens.

30:25.620 --> 30:25.687
Not that I'm not
enjoying these,

30:27.754 --> 30:29.187
but this guy's gross.

30:29.254 --> 30:31.354
Well, maybe
he can help us.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.487
Whoa...

30:34.553 --> 30:36.187
our guy did
get some shots.

30:36.254 --> 30:38.921
The creep liked
skin and blood.

30:38.987 --> 30:40.587
Okay, there's the guy
with the gun.

30:40.654 --> 30:43.487
Let's compare him to the husband
of the dead girl.

30:43.553 --> 30:45.553
It's gonna be kind of hard
with the mask on.

30:49.388 --> 30:51.221
What about height?

30:51.288 --> 30:53.720
Yeah, I could do that if
we have a reference point.

30:53.787 --> 30:56.420
Okay, the thing
with the towel on it.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.587
Nice, okay.

30:59.654 --> 31:01.620
It's called a coat rack,
by the way.

31:01.687 --> 31:03.954
Standard one is 5?feet.

31:04.021 --> 31:06.887
So we just apply
that scale to our guy

31:06.954 --> 31:08.187
and calculate
the difference.

31:08.254 --> 31:11.288
No, five-foot-ten.

31:11.354 --> 31:13.887
Morena's over six feet.
That excludes him.

31:13.954 --> 31:14.954
Oh, hang on.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.254
See something
that could help,

31:16.321 --> 31:18.121
at least when
you do find the guy.

31:18.187 --> 31:19.754
Guy's got a tattoo
on his wrist,

31:19.820 --> 31:21.021
the hand holding
the gun.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.520
Okay, print that out.

31:22.587 --> 31:24.288
I'll give it to everyone.
Good eye.

31:24.354 --> 31:27.154
Speaking of, what happened
at the chop shop, dude?

31:27.221 --> 31:29.453
Heard you pulled
a Statue of Liberty.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.254
Who told you that?

31:32.321 --> 31:34.687
No, just thinking
it was funny,

31:34.754 --> 31:37.354
'cause you told me
to hang back at the dock.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.921
I told you, you didn't
have a weapon.

31:39.987 --> 31:42.121
And I would have used one
if I had one.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.887
You go out on one damn case,
you think you're Serpico?

31:47.954 --> 31:49.487
Wolfe, I...

31:49.553 --> 31:53.587
I didn't have a clean shot.
Okay? That's it.

32:05.487 --> 32:07.121
Eric, what's going on?

32:07.187 --> 32:08.121
Where's Marisol?

32:08.187 --> 32:09.754
She's at
the hospital.

32:09.820 --> 32:11.321
You're sure?
She's not answering

32:11.388 --> 32:12.687
her cell phone and the alarm
just went off at her house.

32:12.754 --> 32:14.487
Let's go.

32:55.687 --> 32:57.921
Eric, check his pulse.

33:05.087 --> 33:06.854
He's dead.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.021
That tattoo.

33:12.087 --> 33:16.187
It matches the one Ryan and
Cooper found on Pete's pictures.

33:16.254 --> 33:18.254
This is the guy
that shot Victoria.

33:18.321 --> 33:20.187
Put a gun in my sister's face.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.087
You son of a bitch.

33:27.154 --> 33:28.154
You know him?

33:28.221 --> 33:30.154
His name's Greg Everest.

33:30.221 --> 33:33.754
Questioned him
when we picked up Carvell.

33:33.820 --> 33:36.520
Worked at the shop.
Came up clean.

33:36.587 --> 33:40.254
Yeah, so the question is, Eric,
who killed him?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.530
How you feeling?

33:52.530 --> 33:55.530
Much better

33:55.530 --> 34:01.530
- But they won't let me go home...
- The shooting from this morning, Marisol 
escalated to home invasion...

34:02.130 --> 34:05.030
I think they're turning on each other
He was found dead at your house today.

34:07.927 --> 34:09.960
What do I do?

34:10.027 --> 34:13.293
I want you to stay at my place
till this is over.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.793
They won't look
for you there.

34:14.860 --> 34:16.994
You've done so much for me.
You don't have to...

34:17.061 --> 34:19.592
I think it would be
a good idea.

34:20.627 --> 34:21.960
Are you sure?

34:22.027 --> 34:23.428
Mm-hmm.

34:23.494 --> 34:24.927
I am.

34:24.994 --> 34:27.460
I'm going to have the officer
take you over there right now.

34:27.527 --> 34:29.194
Officer.

34:29.261 --> 34:31.627
Go ahead.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.592
I can't believe
I let this guy go

34:50.659 --> 34:52.592
at the car place.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.127
Don't beat yourself up,
Calleigh.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.960
The boy looks
like Charlie Brown.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.294
It doesn't matter.

34:57.361 --> 34:59.161
We're taught not to
pay attention to type.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.660
You're also taught
to follow the evidence.

35:01.727 --> 35:03.261
But he had a tattoo.

35:03.327 --> 35:04.528
If I had looked
more closely, I
would've seen it.

35:04.593 --> 35:06.760
It would've been
out of context if you had.

35:06.827 --> 35:09.027
I hope you're right.

35:09.094 --> 35:11.061
Of course I am, honey.

35:15.927 --> 35:17.127
It's a .38.

35:17.194 --> 35:19.994
Same type pulled
from Victoria Morena.

35:20.061 --> 35:22.560
Yeah. I'd have to confirm it,

35:22.627 --> 35:25.061
but I'd say it's possible
he was shot with his own gun.

35:30.494 --> 35:32.394
Well, makes sense.

35:32.461 --> 35:35.027
There are definite signs
of struggle on the body.

35:35.094 --> 35:36.227
Really?
Yeah.

35:36.294 --> 35:37.860
Besides the laceration,

35:37.927 --> 35:39.894
he's got at least one
broken rib

35:39.960 --> 35:41.727
and a nasty contusion.

35:41.794 --> 35:43.294
That's a weird pattern.

35:43.361 --> 35:45.593
Do you think somebody hit him
with something?

35:45.660 --> 35:47.094
Or grabbed him.

35:50.094 --> 35:52.061
That would mean that there
would've had to have been

35:52.127 --> 35:55.094
something between their
hand and his skin.

35:55.161 --> 35:56.660
Well, I can tell you

35:56.727 --> 35:59.560
Greg wasn't wearing long sleeves
when I got to him.

35:59.627 --> 36:01.528
Maybe our killer
was wearing gloves.

36:02.593 --> 36:05.528
Would be enough
to leave a pattern.

36:20.161 --> 36:22.394
So, what did
you and Alexx come up with?

36:22.461 --> 36:24.027
There's a
patterned bruise

36:24.094 --> 36:25.727
on Greg Everest's arm.

36:25.794 --> 36:29.560
So what, you think, uh,
his killer was wearing gloves?

36:29.627 --> 36:31.794
I'm comparing every
pair I could find.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.894
These are close, but they'd
have to have stitching

36:37.960 --> 36:40.627
across the fingers
to make this line.

36:42.261 --> 36:44.227
Maybe stitching
didn't cause it.

36:44.294 --> 36:45.894
Maybe our killer
wore gloves

36:45.960 --> 36:47.227
that stop halfway
up the fingers.

36:47.294 --> 36:48.794
Like weight-
lifting gloves?

36:48.860 --> 36:50.194
Like driving gloves.

36:50.261 --> 36:52.660
Hey, bring up the gloves
I got off Hayden.

37:02.194 --> 37:04.693
He's our man.

37:05.727 --> 37:08.094
I'll tell H.

37:13.027 --> 37:15.361
Greg Everest sold you
a stolen car,

37:15.428 --> 37:16.927
and you wanted him dead.

37:16.994 --> 37:19.127
Look...

37:19.194 --> 37:22.327
I studied business law
at Harvard for two years.

37:22.394 --> 37:24.894
The judge is never going
to hold me on this.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.327
Hayden, this is a criminal case.

37:27.394 --> 37:29.461
<i>( laughs ):
It's not going to matter.</i>

37:29.528 --> 37:30.794
Oh, yes, it will.

37:30.860 --> 37:33.027
Do you know who my father is?

37:33.094 --> 37:34.560
I hope he's a lawyer.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.027
You're going to need one.

37:36.094 --> 37:37.894
This is ridiculous.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.428
I don't even own a gun.

37:39.494 --> 37:41.827
And that's why you used Greg's.

37:41.894 --> 37:43.560
Your own people said
they didn't find

37:43.627 --> 37:46.294
any of that gun residue
stuff on my hands.

37:46.361 --> 37:48.794
That's because you were wearing
driving gloves.

37:50.627 --> 37:51.627
Prove it.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.194
I'm going to.

37:54.261 --> 37:56.927
We confiscated
this glove

37:56.994 --> 37:59.528
when you got pulled over
in the Lamborghini.

37:59.593 --> 38:02.760
Your glove matches
that bruise on Greg.

38:03.794 --> 38:06.194
Okay.

38:06.261 --> 38:07.860
I went to the
guy's work.

38:07.927 --> 38:08.960
I watched him leave.

38:09.027 --> 38:10.027
I followed him
to some house,

38:10.094 --> 38:12.361
and we had an argument.

38:12.428 --> 38:13.528
That car was hot.

38:13.593 --> 38:14.693
Like you didn't know.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.560
I want my money.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.727
I don't have it.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.094
Now get the hell out of here!

38:19.027 --> 38:20.560
It was just
an argument.

38:20.627 --> 38:22.227
I didn't kill anybody.

38:22.294 --> 38:24.361
Drop the act, Hayden, okay?

38:24.428 --> 38:26.361
Based on your education,

38:26.428 --> 38:28.960
you should know we have enough
for a conviction.

38:29.994 --> 38:32.593
<i>( sighs )</i>

38:34.094 --> 38:36.027
He took off with 100
grand of my money.

38:36.094 --> 38:37.693
Wouldn't you try
to get it back?

38:37.760 --> 38:40.394
I suppose I would, but I don't
think I'd kill him over it.

38:40.461 --> 38:41.394
I want my money.

38:41.461 --> 38:42.794
Give it to me.

38:42.860 --> 38:44.960
Listen, you rich little brat,
I'll give you something.

38:46.394 --> 38:48.227
<i>( gunshot )</i>

38:48.294 --> 38:49.894
I couldn't let him
get away with that.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.227
Street punk like that
pulling a gun on someone

38:52.294 --> 38:54.227
with my background?

38:54.294 --> 38:59.161
Well, now, Hayden, you can add
"killer" to your resume.

39:03.894 --> 39:08.027
Hey, we got our guy.
Good job with the Viper.

39:12.227 --> 39:14.894
Thanks.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.327
You, uh... you headed out?

39:18.394 --> 39:19.394
Yeah.

39:24.194 --> 39:28.027
Hey, Ryan, I promise I'm only
going to ask you this once,

39:28.094 --> 39:30.194
but the... shooting...

39:30.261 --> 39:32.461
had nothing to do
with your eye, did it?

39:35.593 --> 39:37.927
I wish it did.

39:41.294 --> 39:44.394
You know, when I first stared
patrol, I was on nights,

39:44.461 --> 39:46.461
and then they moved me
to days,

39:46.528 --> 39:49.760
and after about a year,
they put me back on nights.

39:49.827 --> 39:52.127
I don't follow.

39:52.194 --> 39:55.227
Well, in all my time on days,
I had lost my night eyes.

39:55.294 --> 39:57.660
And I never said anything
to anyone about it

39:57.727 --> 39:59.227
'cause I was scared.

39:59.294 --> 40:00.294
I couldn't see.

40:01.627 --> 40:05.161
You know it was broad daylight
this afternoon.

40:10.627 --> 40:13.161
What I'm saying
is that sometimes...

40:13.227 --> 40:15.960
change can throw you off.

40:16.027 --> 40:18.394
You were on patrol.
You went into the lab.

40:18.461 --> 40:20.994
It's easy to forget
how to be in the field.

40:21.061 --> 40:23.494
Did you ever freeze?

40:23.560 --> 40:25.593
Not yet...

40:25.660 --> 40:28.894
but it could happen
to any of us at any time.

40:36.327 --> 40:37.794
Thank you.

40:39.394 --> 40:42.361
You'd do the same thing for me
if I were having a bad day.

40:46.327 --> 40:48.693
See you later.

40:57.361 --> 40:59.960
Marisol, you okay?

41:00.027 --> 41:02.127
Why aren't you at home?

41:03.528 --> 41:06.627
What's going on?

41:08.461 --> 41:10.560
You know, it's funny.

41:10.627 --> 41:15.560
I... I've been fighting
this... stupid cancer,

41:15.627 --> 41:17.894
and... I don't know.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.461
I guess I never really thought
about things.

41:21.461 --> 41:24.394
Like what things?

41:24.461 --> 41:26.927
Like what I'd be missing.

41:26.994 --> 41:28.927
You know, this morning...

41:28.994 --> 41:34.660
that woman, she was shot
right in front of me.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.261
I don't know.
Sometimes I think...

41:38.327 --> 41:42.760
I've been trying so hard
not to die

41:42.827 --> 41:46.428
that I forget to live.

41:47.593 --> 41:49.593
There's so much
that I-I've never done.

41:49.660 --> 41:51.760
You know,
I've never traveled--

41:51.827 --> 41:54.894
really traveled.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.827
You can do
those things now.

42:03.461 --> 42:06.528
I've never had a baby.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.294
It's not too late.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.827
What did you say?

42:18.894 --> 42:22.294
I said it's not too late.

42:23.327 --> 42:25.394
When you say that...

42:25.461 --> 42:26.960
I believe you.

42:27.027 --> 42:29.693
That's because it's true.
