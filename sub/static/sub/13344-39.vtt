WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:08.342
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.442 --> 00:12.313
I'M TRYING
TO MAKE THIS WORK.
I WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK.

00:12.413 --> 00:15.049
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.584
I'VE DONE TERRIBLE
TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.552
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- NO, REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.421
I HAD SEX WITH BEN.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.894
MY WORST NIGHTMARE,
IT'S HAPPENED

00:26.994 --> 00:28.329
AND I FEEL LIKE
THIS HUGE WEIGHT

00:28.429 --> 00:30.198
HAS BEEN LIFTED
OFF MY SHOULDERS.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.699
YOU SAID THAT
AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED,

00:31.799 --> 00:33.401
YOUR MOTHER
NEVER FORGAVE YOU.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.736
MAYBE YOU'VE NEVER
FORGIVEN YOURSELF, AMY.

00:35.836 --> 00:39.207
MAYBE YOU FEEL
THAT IF YOU DEGRADE
YOURSELF ENOUGH,

00:39.307 --> 00:42.576
SOME DAY SOMEBODY WILL
FORGIVE YOU.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.846
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN ME?

00:45.946 --> 00:49.049
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE WITH ME?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.285
I LOVED YOU.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.089
"LOVED"?

00:58.659 --> 01:02.163
Paul: HEY. HEY, MAX,
DON'T DUMP THAT STUFF
ON THE STAIRCASE.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.931
AND CALL DEVINN

01:04.031 --> 01:06.600
AND GET THAT
READING ASSIGNMENT, OKAY?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.238
( sighs )

01:12.039 --> 01:13.441
HEY, HOW'D HE DO?

01:13.541 --> 01:16.610
GOOD.
THEY'RE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.012
I'M GLAD YOU WENT.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.115
IT WAS FUN.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.451
PAUL, COULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?
CAN YOU CLOSE THE DOOR?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.719
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING FOR A MINUTE.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.801
UH, I LEFT GINA
A MESSAGE TODAY,

01:40.901 --> 01:44.004
AND I TOLD HER THAT...

01:44.104 --> 01:47.275
I WON'T BE GOING BACK
TO THERAPY ANYMORE.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.279
YOU AND I,
WE CAN GO BACK
AND FORTH FOREVER

01:51.379 --> 01:53.814
ABOUT WHERE
OUR PROBLEM STARTED...

01:55.616 --> 01:58.852
WHO DID WHAT TO WHOM,
WHO'S MORE TO BLAME.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.190
I CAN'T DO THAT
ANYMORE.

02:02.290 --> 02:06.260
I NEED TO FIGURE
THIS OUT,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.297
AND I THINK I NEED
TO DO THAT ON MY OWN.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.805
OKAY.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.683
I'M REALLY HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE SEEING GINA.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.488
AND I REALLY HOPE
IT CAN HELP YOU.

02:47.468 --> 02:52.240
( door opens, closes )

02:53.407 --> 02:55.909
( theme music playing )

03:13.093 --> 03:15.062
IS AMY
JOINING US TODAY?

03:15.162 --> 03:16.697
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.435
OKAY.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.071
SO WHAT'S BEEN UP
WITH YOU, JAKE?

03:24.171 --> 03:26.540
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A PRETTY WEIRD WEEK

03:26.640 --> 03:28.208
SINCE WE SAW YOU
LAST, PAUL.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.178
VERY QUIET
AROUND THE HOUSE.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.813
AWKWARD.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.449
WE BARELY SPEAK TO EACH OTHER
EXCEPT WHEN LENNY'S AROUND,

03:35.549 --> 03:40.254
WHO SOMEHOW SEEMS
REALLY RELAXED AND AT EASE.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.923
HE'S SUCH A FUNNY KID.
MAN, I WISH YOU
COULD MEET HIM.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.494
HE WAS TELLING US
THIS JOKE THE OTHER DAY

03:46.594 --> 03:49.630
ABOUT THESE TWO CANNIBALS

03:49.730 --> 03:51.399
THAT EAT A CLOWN.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.702
AND ONE CANNIBAL TURNS
TO THE OTHER AND SAYS...

03:56.404 --> 03:58.572
"DOES THIS TASTE
FUNNY TO YOU?"

04:00.741 --> 04:05.045
ANYWAY, AMY AND I ARE
LAUGHING DESPITE OURSELVES.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.348
IT WAS VERY SURREAL.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.852
YOU KNOW,
KIDS TEND TO DO THAT
WHEN THEY SENSE TENSION.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.921
THEY TRY TO GET THE PARENTS
TO COME TOGETHER.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.757
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,
BUT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
DO IT. IT'S NOT FAIR.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.761
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

04:24.231 --> 04:27.301
( sighs )

04:27.401 --> 04:30.671
AMY'S BEEN TRYING
TO REACH OUT TO ME
THIS WEEK...

04:32.473 --> 04:34.241
YOU KNOW,
MAKE IT ALL OKAY,

04:34.342 --> 04:37.177
THE WHOLE BEN THING,
BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE UP
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.113
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT'S PRETTY SAD

04:40.213 --> 04:41.682
WATCHING HER TRY.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.651
WHEN LENNY FELL ASLEEP
THE OTHER NIGHT,

04:43.751 --> 04:46.186
SHE RAN AROUND
THE HOUSE, PAUL,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.688
PRETENDING TO BE BUSY
WITH HOUSE SHIT--

04:47.788 --> 04:49.623
WHICH SHE NEVER DOES--
NOT SAYING ANYTHING,

04:49.723 --> 04:51.191
JUST TRYING
TO RUN INTO ME.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.560
AND AT ONE POINT WE WERE

04:52.660 --> 04:54.395
PRETTY CLOSE TOGETHER
IN THE KITCHEN,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.964
SHE TRIED TO KISS ME...

05:00.468 --> 05:01.969
AND I JUST...

05:02.703 --> 05:05.205
WHAT?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.041
JUST COULDN'T DO IT.
I WASN'T INTO IT.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.545
- MY HEART WASN'T THERE.
- MMM.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.817
YEAH, IT CAN BE HARD
TO RELATE TO SOMEBODY...

05:19.219 --> 05:20.921
AFTER SOMETHING
LIKE AN AFFAIR.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.556
YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.392
BIZARRE.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.562
LATE THAT NIGHT,
SHE HAD...

05:28.662 --> 05:31.765
FALLEN ASLEEP
WATCHING TV AND I JUST--

05:33.401 --> 05:35.335
I JUST STOOD THERE
LOOKING AT HER.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.006
HOW DID YOU FEEL?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.976
WELL, SHE SLEEPS
WITH HER BOTH HANDS

05:43.076 --> 05:46.680
TUCKED UNDER HER CHEEK
LIKE IN THOSE KID BOOKS.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.951
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY DRAW
THE ANGELS SLEEPING.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.655
SHE DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A WOMAN WHO HAD
JUST FUCKED SOME OTHER GUY.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.528
SHE LOOKED
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.996
AND I WAS
THINKING HOW EASY
IT WOULD BE TO JUST...

06:03.096 --> 06:06.099
GO LAY DOWN NEXT TO HER
AND PUT MY ARMS AROUND HER.

06:07.635 --> 06:12.239
- BUT YOU DIDN'T.
- NO, I COULDN'T.

06:12.339 --> 06:15.409
I JUST REMEMBERED
HOW EASILY SHE COULD
CHIP AWAY AT ME

06:15.509 --> 06:17.110
AND LURE ME BACK IN.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.481
SO I JUMPED
IN MY CAR AND I GOT
THE FUCK OUT OF THERE.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.883
- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.187
- WHERE'D YOU GO?
- WELL, I THOUGHT
OF GOING TO ELLIOT'S,

06:27.287 --> 06:28.789
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
HE HAD A DATE.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.691
I DIDN'T WANT
TO WALK IN ON ANYTHING.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.227
IT'S BEEN ABOUT SIX YEARS
SINCE THE GUY GOT LAID,

06:34.327 --> 06:35.496
SO I JUST KEPT DRIVING

06:35.596 --> 06:37.931
AND I ENDED UP
AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.967
( laughs )

06:40.067 --> 06:43.804
THE KICKER IS THEY LIVE
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AWAY
IN VIRGINIA.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.173
AND IT WAS TOO EARLY
WHEN I GOT THERE TO RING
THE DOORBELL,

06:46.273 --> 06:50.678
SO I JUST SAT
OUT FRONT IN MY CAR
AND FELL ASLEEP.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.447
HOW OFTEN DO YOU
SEE THEM, YOUR PARENTS?

06:53.547 --> 06:54.848
WELL, MOM COMES
INTO TOWN TO SEE LENNY

06:54.948 --> 06:56.917
PRETTY FREQUENTLY--
EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.852
MAYBE WE GO OUT THERE
FOR THE HOLIDAYS

06:58.952 --> 07:00.654
A COUPLE OF TIMES
A YEAR, NOT MUCH MORE.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.690
AND IS YOUR FATHER
CLOSE TO LENNY?

07:02.790 --> 07:05.025
IS MY FATHER
CLOSE TO LENNY?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.728
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I MEAN, I THINK SO.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.563
THEY SPEND TIME TOGETHER,
LENNY LIKES HIM.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.364
BUT IT ALWAYS
FEELS FINITE, YOU KNOW?

07:11.465 --> 07:14.802
I CAN'T HELP
BUT GET THE FEELING
THAT HE LEAVES HIM HANGING,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.637
LIKE HE'S JUST SPENT
A FEW MINUTES

07:16.737 --> 07:18.105
WITH THE NEIGHBOR'S
GRANDCHILD OR SOMETHING

07:18.205 --> 07:19.907
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.009
OF COURSE, MY DAD,
BEING THE NARCISSIST
THAT HE IS,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.343
IS OBLIVIOUS TO IT.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.445
HAS LENNY SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT IT?

07:25.546 --> 07:27.815
NO. HE SEEMS FINE
WITH IT,

07:27.915 --> 07:30.584
SO WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE I'M JUST
SEEING THINGS.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.560
I WAS ASLEEP IN THE CAR
OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE

07:39.660 --> 07:41.562
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THERE'S THIS KNOCK
ON THE WINDOW

07:41.662 --> 07:43.497
AND IT WAKES ME UP.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.867
AND IT'S A COP.
AND WHO IS THE COP?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.070
MIKE GARNETT.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.438
WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME,

07:51.539 --> 07:53.306
WANTED TO BE A COP
SINCE THE FIRST GRADE

07:53.406 --> 07:55.976
AND NOW THAT'S
WHAT HE IS.
( chuckles )

07:56.076 --> 07:58.512
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
HE FULFILLED HIS
CHILDHOOD DREAM.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.581
I DON'T THINK
I KNOW ANYONE WHO BECAME

08:00.681 --> 08:02.616
WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE
WHEN THEY WERE A KID.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.586
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,
IN THE WINTERTIME

08:05.686 --> 08:07.721
THERE WAS THIS GUY

08:07.821 --> 08:09.757
AND HE WOULD COME OVER
WITH HIS CHAINSAW

08:09.857 --> 08:11.959
AND HE WOULD SWING
FROM TREE TO TREE

08:12.059 --> 08:14.528
CUTTING BRANCHES
BEFORE THEY FROZE
AND FELL OFF

08:14.628 --> 08:17.264
LIKE A FUCKING MONKEY.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.700
AND HE WAS
THE ONLY GUY I KNEW

08:19.800 --> 08:23.403
WHO MY FATHER DIDN'T TELL
HOW TO DO HIS JOB.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.573
THAT'S WHO
I WANTED TO BE.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.575
HMM.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.784
THE OLD MAN,
HE'S SUCH A KNOW-IT-ALL.

08:36.884 --> 08:42.055
THE FUNNY PART IS THOUGH,
HE DOES KNOW IT ALL.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.058
HE CAN TELL YOU
THE EXCHANGE RATE
FOR A GUYANESE DOLLAR,

08:45.158 --> 08:48.361
HOW TO COOK
A FRESHWATER SALMON
IN A CLAY OVEN

08:48.461 --> 08:49.997
OR THE HISTORY
OF THE SILK WORM.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.132
- WHAT, DOES HE WRITE
ENCYCLOPEDIAS?
- ( chuckles )

08:52.232 --> 08:55.168
YOU'D THINK, RIGHT?
NO, HE'S A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.504
MY MOM TOO.
INTELLECTUALS.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.306
BIG READERS, UNLIKE ME.
I DON'T READ.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.842
I DON'T THINK
I'VE READ A BOOK
SINCE I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.580
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU DON'T OR YOU WON'T?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.983
- I HAVEN'T.
- REALLY?

09:10.083 --> 09:13.053
I REMEMBER
ONCE I MISQUOTED
ROLAND BARTHES

09:13.153 --> 09:15.422
AND YOU CORRECTED ME.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.658
WHERE DID
THAT COME FROM?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.961
I GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD
WHERE EVERYONE WAS READING
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.663
THAT SHIT WAS EVERYWHERE.
ANY PARROT COULD PICK IT UP

09:22.763 --> 09:24.865
AND SPIT IT BACK VERBATIM.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.034
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOUR DAD IS

09:27.134 --> 09:29.036
AN EMERITUS PROFESSOR
OF RENAISSANCE STUDIES

09:29.136 --> 09:33.473
AND YOUR MOTHER
TEACHES CLASSICS--
GREEK AND HEBREW.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.442
BUT I DON'T READ.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.510
I MEAN NOT LITERALLY.
OBVIOUSLY I READ.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.648
I READ MUSIC, MANUALS,
HEADLINES,

09:40.748 --> 09:42.515
BUT I JUST--

09:42.616 --> 09:44.685
I DON'T KNOW.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.787
I'M NOT LIKE THEM.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.962
I DO KICK ASS
AT CROSSWORD PUZZLES THOUGH.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.331
- YOU DO THOSE?
- I'M NOT VERY GOOD.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.235
SUNDAY "NEW YORK TIMES"
CROSSWORD DOES ME IN
EVERY WEEK.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.204
YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.841
YOU KNOW,
TO DO CROSSWORD PUZZLES

10:07.941 --> 10:12.112
YOU NEED TO HAVE
AN EXTENSIVE VOCABULARY, NO?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.214
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO RECONCILE THE IDEA
OF SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T READ

10:14.314 --> 10:16.316
WITH SOMEBODY
WHO'S REALLY GOOD
AT CROSSWORD PUZZLES.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.618
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO RECONCILE.
I'M GOOD AT IT

10:18.719 --> 10:21.254
AND READING MAKES ME
RESTLESS AND BORED.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.992
SO DID YOU ACQUIRE YOUR LOVE
OF CROSSWORD PUZZLES
FROM YOUR PARENTS?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.294
NOT REALLY. MY MOM'S
ALL RIGHT AT THEM.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.231
MY DAD SUCKS.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.870
SO WHAT DID
YOU DO AS A KID

10:36.970 --> 10:40.307
WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS
DOING ALL THIS READING?

10:40.407 --> 10:41.875
I DON'T KNOW.
PLAY GUITAR,

10:41.975 --> 10:45.412
COLLECT BASEBALL CARDS,
SMOKE POT.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.947
DID THAT GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE?

10:47.047 --> 10:48.982
NOT REALLY.
NOBODY NOTICED.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.684
NOBODY NOTICED
THAT YOU GOT HIGH?

10:50.784 --> 10:54.587
- NO.
- SO WHO WERE YOU
GETTING HIGH WITH?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.590
- MYSELF MOSTLY.
- HMM.

10:57.691 --> 11:01.561
SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT
YOU HAD A LONELY CHILDHOOD?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.797
NAH. WHY?

11:03.897 --> 11:07.000
IT WAS OKAY.
I TALKED TO MYSELF A LOT.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.240
YOU KNOW WHAT ONE
OF MY FAVORITE THINGS
IN THE WORLD IS?

11:14.241 --> 11:15.408
TALKING TO LENNY.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.778
AND WE TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING,

11:17.878 --> 11:20.180
BUT MAINLY
WE TALK ABOUT SPORTS.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.016
AND HE CAN JUST GO OFF.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.185
ALUMINUM BATS
VERSUS WOOD--

11:25.285 --> 11:28.789
FUCK, ANYTHING.
THAT KID HAS A BRAIN
LIKE A COMPUTER.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.791
HE'S NOT EVEN 10
AND HE CAN LIST OFF

11:30.891 --> 11:35.062
ALL OF BOOG POWELL'S STATS
FROM THE 1970 WORLD SERIES.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.730
( chuckles )

11:36.830 --> 11:38.766
THAT'S JUST AMAZING TO ME.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.735
I NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING
THAT LITTLE FUCKER TALK.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.973
YOU GET LIKE THAT
WITH YOUR KIDS?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.641
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE
BECAUSE THEY'RE OLDER,

11:48.742 --> 11:51.779
BUT WITH MY YOUNGEST,
YEAH, I STILL DO.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.781
- AND HOW OLD IS HE?
- HE'S NINE.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.582
JUST LIKE LENNY.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.450
DID YOU HAVE THAT KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP

11:57.550 --> 11:59.052
WITH YOUR FATHER
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

11:59.152 --> 12:01.822
NO, I AVOIDED
TALKING TO MY FATHER
WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.557
IT JUST WASN'T WORTH IT.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.893
HE WAS THE KIND OF GUY
WHO WOULD WINCE

12:05.993 --> 12:08.661
IF YOU SAID SURE
INSTEAD OF SURELY.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.431
DID YOU FIND IT EASIER
TO TALK TO YOUR MOM?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.266
SHE WASN'T AS BAD,

12:13.366 --> 12:14.734
BUT WHAT WAS FRUSTRATING

12:14.835 --> 12:17.771
WAS SHE WOULD ALWAYS DEFER
TO HIM ON EVERYTHING.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.407
IT'S LIKE SHE SAW HIM
AS THIS HOTSHOT PROFESSOR

12:20.507 --> 12:22.075
AT ANOTHER LEVEL
FROM EVERYONE.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.311
HE GOT TENURE AT 33
AND IT JUST WOULDN'T
OCCUR TO HER

12:24.411 --> 12:27.347
THAT SHE COULD HAVE
AN OPINION DIFFERENT
FROM HIS-- THAN HIS.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.183
IF YOU WERE HIM,
YOU WOULD HAVE JUST
CORRECTED ME ON MY GRAMMAR.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.952
IF YOU WERE HE.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.860
HEY, THEY DIDN'T
BEAT ME, RIGHT?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.561
IT COULD'VE BEEN
A HELL OF A LOT WORSE.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.763
THAT'S TRUE.
IT DOESN'T--

12:43.864 --> 12:46.099
IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT WASN'T DIFFICULT.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.735
SO WHEN DID
YOU START TO WRITE?

12:48.836 --> 12:51.171
I DON'T WRITE.
MY BROTHER NATHAN
IS THE WRITER.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.940
HE'S A NOVELIST.
HE WAS JUST SHORTLISTED

12:53.040 --> 12:55.976
FOR SOME PRIZE LAST YEAR,
SOME BIG NATIONAL AWARD.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.645
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE NAME.
I'M SURE MY PARENTS REMEMBER IT.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.213
BUT YOU'RE A WRITER TOO.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.416
OR DON'T YOU
CONSIDER SONGWRITING
TO BE WRITING?

13:03.516 --> 13:06.119
NO, SURE, I DO.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.822
SOME OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS
ARE ACTUALLY SONGWRITERS,

13:08.922 --> 13:12.092
PEOPLE LIKE DYLAN,
COHEN, JOHN LENNON.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.694
HEY, I AGREE WITH YOU, PAUL.
I WOULD PUT DYLAN ON PAR

13:14.794 --> 13:16.363
WITH WALT WHITMAN,
EZRA POUND,

13:16.463 --> 13:20.533
LANGSTON HUGHES.
JUST TRY TELLING THAT
TO MY FAMILY.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.570
YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEBODY WHO
IS NOT A GREAT READER,

13:23.670 --> 13:26.406
YOU SEEM TO BE
PRETTY FAMILIAR
WITH GREAT POETS.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.742
NOBODY'S REALLY
FAMILIAR WITH POUND.
THEY JUST FAKE IT.

13:29.843 --> 13:33.280
( both chuckling )

13:33.380 --> 13:36.616
BUT I GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU LIKE TO PLAY DOWN
YOUR KNOWLEDGE,

13:36.716 --> 13:38.952
YOUR-- YOUR INTELLIGENCE.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.922
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST MY FOLKS'S WORLD.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.491
I GUESS SOME
OF IT'S RUBBED OFF ON ME.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.726
BUT IT'S JUST NOT ME.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.530
DID YOUR PARENTS EVER
EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN WHAT
YOU MIGHT DO FOR A LIVING?

13:50.630 --> 13:54.001
MY DAD PROBABLY
WANTED ME TO BE
SOME KIND OF ACADEMIC.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.602
IT'S THE FAMILY BUSINESS,
AFTER ALL.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.405
BUT WHAT DID HE EXPECT?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.839
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.342
I THINK HE GAVE UP
THE DREAM ON ME

14:02.442 --> 14:05.078
PRETTY EARLY
AFTER I FLUNKED OUT
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.914
SO WHICH DO YOU
THINK CAME FIRST,

14:07.014 --> 14:09.816
YOUR FATHER'S
LOW EXPECTATIONS
OR YOUR LOW GRADES?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.784
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- OFTEN WITH EXPECTATIONS,

14:11.885 --> 14:14.454
THERE'S A SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.489
MAYBE YOU DECIDED
EARLIER ON

14:16.589 --> 14:18.791
THAT YOU COULDN'T MATCH UP
TO HIS EXPECTATIONS

14:18.892 --> 14:21.261
- AND SO YOU GAVE UP TRYING.
- MMM, COULD BE.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.997
MY MOM WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET ME INTERESTED.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.934
SHE'D HELP ME STUDY
FOR TESTS ON THE SLY.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.970
- ON THE SLY?
- YEAH, IT PISSED
MY DAD OFF.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.940
HE THOUGHT SHE WAS
SPOON-FEEDING ME THINGS

14:33.040 --> 14:35.408
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
OR FIGURED OUT BY MYSELF.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.211
AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED
HE'D FIND OUT.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.612
WAS SHE...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.748
GENERALLY
INTIMIDATED BY HIM?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.683
( dryly )
"YOU'RE SO RIGHT, ABE.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.218
I NEVER LOOKED AT IT
THAT WAY, ABE."

14:45.318 --> 14:48.688
YEAH, IT MADE ME
WANT TO SCREAM.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.390
ONE THING YOU CAN SAY
ABOUT ME, PAUL,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.625
IS I SURE AS HELL
DIDN'T MARRY MY MOTHER.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.364
YOU MEAN
YOU DIDN'T MARRY

14:57.464 --> 14:59.632
A WOMAN WHO WAS
INTIMIDATED BY YOU.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.076
SO HOW DO YOUR PARENTS
FEEL ABOUT AMY?

15:09.176 --> 15:11.278
SHE'S A SUCCESSFUL
BUSINESSWOMAN,

15:11.378 --> 15:14.281
SHE'S GOT AN MBA,
THEY FUCKING LOVE THAT
SHE WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.684
THEIR HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUT
OF A SON MARRIED

15:17.784 --> 15:20.320
A HOTSHOT BUSINESSWOMAN.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.790
IT'S INTERESTING
YOU USE THE SAME WORD

15:23.890 --> 15:26.259
TO DESCRIBE YOUR FATHER
ALSO-- HOTSHOT.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.363
DO YOU THINK
THAT THEY'RE ALIKE
IN OTHER WAYS?

15:30.463 --> 15:33.066
THEY'RE NOT.
THEY'RE TOTAL OPPOSITES.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.469
HE'S ALL RUMPLED CORDUROY,
STAINS ON HIS SHIRT,

15:36.569 --> 15:38.771
AND SHE'S, WELL--

15:38.871 --> 15:41.441
HELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT AMY IS-- METICULOUS,

15:41.541 --> 15:43.210
PUT TOGETHER,
VERY MATERIALISTIC.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.778
SHE LOVES
HER STUFF, HUH?

15:45.878 --> 15:48.281
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE MET,
I WAS CRASHING

15:48.381 --> 15:51.051
IN THIS CRAPPY APARTMENT
OVER A GARAGE.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.453
I THINK
IT TURNED HER ON.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.088
AND THE WOMAN HAD
NEVER FUCKED ON A BED

15:55.188 --> 15:59.026
WITHOUT A BOX SPRING,
AND SHE LIKED IT.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.028
YOU KNOW, COMING DOWN
FROM HER PEDESTAL,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.296
HANG WITH THE RIFFRAFF.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.102
DID YOU FEEL
LIKE YOUR FATHER WAS
ALSO ON A PEDESTAL?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.138
COME ON, PAUL.
LET'S GET OFF THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

16:11.238 --> 16:13.440
THIS IS NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.358
I DON'T HAVE
THAT MANY PEOPLE
TO TALK TOO RIGHT NOW.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.730
AND I'M SCARED SHITLESS
OF LOSING LENNY

16:37.830 --> 16:40.033
IN SOME CUSTODY BATTLE.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.903
AMY'S... UNSTABLE.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.174
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
SHE'S GETTING A DIVORCE
AFTER HAVING AN AFFAIR,

16:47.274 --> 16:49.376
AND I THINK
SHE'S GONNA FUCK HIM UP.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.311
YOU SAID YOURSELF
SHE NEEDS LOSERS AROUND.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.680
I THINK SHE'S GONNA
TEACH HIM TO BE A LOSER.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.117
SHE'S DAMAGED, PAUL.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.286
SHE'S FUCKED UP.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.756
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH RIGHT
IN MY LIFE EXCEPT THAT KID,

17:03.856 --> 17:05.725
AND THAT KID IS...

17:07.160 --> 17:10.130
WHAT THE FUCK?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.332
DID YOU NOT PAY
YOUR ELECTRIC BILL
OR SOMETHING?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.140
HUH.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S OUT

17:20.240 --> 17:22.375
ON THE ENTIRE STREET.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.615
- YOU WANT TO GO ON?
- I CAN SEE YOU FINE.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.383
YOU'RE SURE?

18:01.047 --> 18:05.152
FOR THE FIRST TIME, PAUL...

18:05.252 --> 18:07.354
IT REALLY FEELS
LIKE WE'RE SPLITTING UP.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.124
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT

18:11.224 --> 18:13.760
OR BROUGHT IT UP,
IT'S NEVER FELT SO...

18:16.028 --> 18:17.864
REAL.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.136
WHY DO YOU THINK IT FEELS
DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.908
THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE,

18:29.008 --> 18:33.546
YOU IMPLIED
THAT YOU'D FALLEN OUT
OF LOVE WITH AMY.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.415
WOULD YOU STILL SAY
THAT'S TRUE?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.350
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.452
WHAT DOES
IT FEEL LIKE?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.788
I'VE ONLY BEEN IN LOVE
WITH ONE GIRL-- HER.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.457
I'VE NEVER FALLEN OUT OF LOVE.
TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

18:44.557 --> 18:47.160
AND I'LL TELL YOU
IF I'M FEELING IT.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.529
HAVE YOU EVER FELT IT?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.436
THERE'S A HUGE
SADNESS THERE...

18:58.505 --> 19:01.541
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEEN LOST.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.512
AND YOU BEGIN
TO LOSE THE DESIRE TO...

19:07.647 --> 19:09.182
CONNECT.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.353
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOUR FATHER.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.788
HE'S THE GUY WHO KNOWS
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

19:18.225 --> 19:19.426
DID I TELL YOU WHAT
HE SAID WHEN I SHOWED UP

19:19.526 --> 19:21.361
AND TOLD HIM
MY MARRIAGE WAS OVER?

19:21.461 --> 19:24.331
"WELL, THIS ISN'T
ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED, IS IT?"

19:26.933 --> 19:28.368
HE EXPECTS ME
TO FAIL

19:28.468 --> 19:31.638
EVERY TIME
AT EVERYTHING.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.076
WHY DID YOU
GO HOME, JAKE?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.446
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.181
I JUST STARTED DRIVING
AND THAT'S WHERE I ENDED UP.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.317
MMM. THIS IS THERAPY.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.654
WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN ACCIDENTS HERE.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.025
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I MEAN, I'M ABOUT
TO BE A SINGLE DAD,

19:53.125 --> 19:55.328
MAYBE I, UH...

19:59.832 --> 20:03.670
MAYBE I JUST FELT LIKE
I WANTED TO TALK TO MY MOM.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.438
OR YOUR DAD?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.074
HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING
TO A WORD I'VE SAID?

20:08.174 --> 20:10.810
I CAN'T FUCKING STAND
MY FATHER.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.445
IT'S INTERESTING THAT
YOU USED THE SAME WORD

20:12.545 --> 20:16.649
TO DESCRIBE AMY
AND YOUR FATHER--
HOTSHOT--

20:16.749 --> 20:19.752
BUT YOU KEEP INSISTING
THAT THEY'RE NOTHING
LIKE EACH OTHER.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.021
WELL, THEY'RE NOT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS?

20:22.121 --> 20:26.225
LOOK, YOU MARRIED
AN INTELLIGENT,
OVERACHIEVING WOMAN

20:26.326 --> 20:28.027
WHO SEEMS
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

20:28.127 --> 20:32.599
OF HER AUTHORITY
IN THE WORLD.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.302
THE CRITICISM
AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT
YOU GOT FROM YOUR FATHER--

20:35.402 --> 20:39.472
DON'T YOU FEEL THAT
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FROM AMY?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.847
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH AMY IS FALLING APART,

20:47.947 --> 20:50.283
SO YOU GET IN THE CAR,
YOU DRIVE FOR FOUR HOURS
TO VIRGINIA

20:50.383 --> 20:53.520
AND YOU FIND YOURSELF
BY ACCIDENT

20:53.620 --> 20:56.889
OUTSIDE
YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE?

21:13.706 --> 21:16.543
YOU THINK I WAS
GOING BACK TO THE SOURCE.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.046
JESUS, THAT'S SICK.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.315
IT'S NOT SICK, JAKE.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.983
THE MORE
WE OPEN OURSELVES

21:24.083 --> 21:27.286
TO THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS,
THE MORE WE CAN EXAMINE--

21:27.387 --> 21:29.389
MORE THERAPY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.758
I NEED THAT LIKE I NEED
A HOLE IN MY HEAD.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.596
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:36.696 --> 21:38.665
WHO CARES WHY
I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT?

21:38.765 --> 21:40.567
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
HOW MY PARENTS TALK

21:40.667 --> 21:42.569
AT THE FUCKING
DINNER TABLE, ALL RIGHT?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.170
I HAVE LEARNED
FROM MY FATHER'S MISTAKES.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.373
I'M A MUCH BETTER FATHER
THAN HE IS.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.049
I DON'T WANT
TO FUCK IT UP, PAUL.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.952
I DON'T WANT
TO FUCK MY KID UP.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.427
I NEED--

22:09.562 --> 22:11.731
I NEED THEIR HELP.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.634
I NEED YOUR HELP.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.038
I NEED HELP,
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.414
WHAT'S THE ROAD MAP,
YOU KNOW?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.661
I FEEL SCARED.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.374
YOU KNOW, I WISH
I COULD SAY IT WAS
THAT SIMPLE, JAKE.

22:55.475 --> 22:58.545
THAT I COULD JUST
GIVE YOU A ROAD MAP,

22:58.645 --> 23:00.813
A BOOK OF INSTRUCTIONS...

23:00.913 --> 23:02.482
( chuckles )

23:02.582 --> 23:04.784
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
LIFE ISN'T LIKE THAT.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.689
BUT YOU KNOW
THAT OLD SAYING THAT

23:09.789 --> 23:13.660
A JOURNEY
OF 1,000 MILES BEGINS
WITH A SINGLE STEP?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.363
YEAH.
OR IN MY CASE,

23:17.464 --> 23:20.467
TWO STEPS UP
AND ONE STEP BACK.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.569
( both chuckle )

23:40.853 --> 23:43.790
YOU KNOW,
IF THIS WAS A MOVIE...

23:43.890 --> 23:46.659
THE LIGHTS WOULD
COME ON RIGHT NOW.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.762
IF THIS WERE A MOVIE.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.065
WERE A MOVIE.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.953
( theme music playing )
