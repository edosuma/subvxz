00:51.790 --> 00:54.358
Well, I was...

00:54.402 --> 00:56.926
I just wanted to see
how it ends.

00:56.969 --> 01:00.147
So, you're the brave one.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.149
- I guess.
- It's good.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.150
It'll carry well down there.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.068
A little help here, Francis.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.157
Come on.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.442
Not quite it, Francis.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.661
Just not quite it.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.330
Francis! Look what you did!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.404
Bad turtles
don't get smoothies.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.342
Come on...

04:48.810 --> 04:49.985
Stop!

04:50.028 --> 04:52.509
It's not funny.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.337
Stop it!

05:19.536 --> 05:22.496
This is good,
if I do say so myself.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.428
Ow.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.606
Ow.

05:49.566 --> 05:53.048
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:17.741 --> 07:20.222
The end is kind of sad.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.267
Are you sure
you wanna hear this?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.792
Okay.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.315
"Once upon a time,

07:26.358 --> 07:28.535
there was a unicorn
named Eleanor.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.275
She wasn't like
the other unicorns

07:30.319 --> 07:33.278
because she had two horns.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.151
There's the wizard,

07:36.194 --> 07:37.500
he says he can help her,

07:37.544 --> 07:39.197
but only if she finds

07:39.241 --> 07:40.416
someone else like her.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.809
So she wanders around

07:41.852 --> 07:43.027
until she finds a knight

07:43.071 --> 07:44.507
who's stuck in a tree.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.769
He's lonely, too,

07:45.813 --> 07:48.337
and his name is Francis.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.559
And they go back to the wizard

07:52.602 --> 07:54.778
so he can make her normal.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.215
But then the wizard says

07:57.259 --> 07:58.782
that she's better than normal,

07:58.826 --> 08:00.741
she's special.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.307
And now that
she has another friend,

08:02.351 --> 08:03.961
she's not lonely."

08:04.005 --> 08:05.528
And that's it. The end.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.792
But it doesn't make sense.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.534
That's not even what she wanted.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.579
See?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.145
Told you it was sad.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.545
I want Mommy and Daddy.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.775
No peeking, okay?

08:40.998 --> 08:43.523
One alligator,

08:43.566 --> 08:44.872
two alligator,

08:44.915 --> 08:46.264
three alligator,

08:46.308 --> 08:48.223
four alligator,

08:48.266 --> 08:50.312
five alligator,

08:50.355 --> 08:52.183
six alligator,

08:52.227 --> 08:55.012
seven alligator,

08:55.056 --> 08:56.797
eight alligator,

08:56.840 --> 08:58.712
nine alligator,

08:58.755 --> 09:00.365
ten alligator,

09:00.409 --> 09:01.802
eleven alligator,

09:01.845 --> 09:03.325
twelve alligator,

09:03.368 --> 09:05.196
thirteen alligator,

09:06.763 --> 09:08.983
fourteen alligator,

09:09.026 --> 09:10.985
fifteen alligator,

09:13.335 --> 09:15.293
sixteen alligator,

09:15.337 --> 09:17.339
seventeen alligator,

09:17.382 --> 09:19.341
eighteen alligator,

09:19.384 --> 09:20.951
nineteen alligator...

09:24.302 --> 09:25.869
twenty alligator...

09:29.960 --> 09:31.527
twenty-one alligator,

09:32.441 --> 09:34.922
twenty-two alligator.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.011
Okay, Francis, I'm here.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.187
Come find me!

10:12.133 --> 10:13.264
Go away. Please, go away!

10:13.308 --> 10:15.440
Go away.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.073
It came back.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.730
See that?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.514
That's where it lives.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.647
Out past the trees.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.999
When the monster comes,

11:36.043 --> 11:37.348
you have to stay calm.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.524
You can't even think
bad thoughts.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.397
If it hears you,
it gets super angry.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.015
Don't worry,
I won't let him get you.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.148
You have to do what I say,

11:54.191 --> 11:55.889
because I'm your mommy.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.674
That means I'll always
take care of you,

11:58.718 --> 12:01.242
and never go away
and leave you.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.816
Come on, Francis,
kick it back.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.515
Don't be a loser.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.736
Oh, Mr. Hopper!

12:17.998 --> 12:19.173
I'll be right back.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.501
Shoot!

12:47.854 --> 12:49.029
Shit!

12:51.640 --> 12:53.163
Shit-ass! Shit!

12:53.207 --> 12:55.078
Shit-ass, shit-ass,
shit-ass, shit!

12:55.122 --> 12:56.993
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

12:57.037 --> 12:59.779
Shit!

12:59.822 --> 13:01.650
Shit-ass!

13:01.693 --> 13:03.217
Shit!

13:03.260 --> 13:05.436
Ass!

13:09.527 --> 13:10.615
Shit-ass, shit,

13:10.659 --> 13:11.878
shit, shit, shit.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.009
Shit-ass, shit,

13:13.053 --> 13:14.358
shit, shit, shit.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.403
Shit-ass, shit,

13:15.446 --> 13:16.883
shit, shit, shit.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.191
Mr. Hopper...

13:23.150 --> 13:24.629
I made you lunch.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
Why don't you come back home?

13:28.895 --> 13:31.027
We miss you.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.900
Me and Francis.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.815
Aw.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.297
You just enjoy

13:40.341 --> 13:44.127
the nice cup of tomato sauce.

13:45.737 --> 13:46.913
No! Wait!

13:46.956 --> 13:48.001
Wait, stop.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.089
Come to Mommy.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.307
Stop.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.096
Stay.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.402
Stay.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.884
Now, come back.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.712
Come here, Mr. Hopper.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.106
Wait!

14:06.149 --> 14:08.151
Don't go in there!

14:08.195 --> 14:09.979
Please come back.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.509
Don't leave me.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.473
Ugh.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.134
Ugh.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.405
Sorry, I'm sorry.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
I shouldn't have brought
you a pumpkin.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.974
It was stupid, it's just...

16:15.017 --> 16:16.323
they get rotten so fast

16:16.366 --> 16:18.281
and you never got to finish it.

16:18.325 --> 16:22.155
So, don't be mad.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.373
Okay?

16:24.635 --> 16:25.854
Paul?

16:36.908 --> 16:39.128
The monster's back.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.922
Your fingers are cold.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.622
Let me sleep here.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.625
Those outside
the hot-zones are required

17:41.669 --> 17:42.757
to remain in their homes

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
while quarantine is in effect.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.760
Airports are closed.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.414
No unauthorized travel
is allowed to...

17:47.457 --> 17:49.590
Containment
facilities are being

17:49.633 --> 17:50.939
constructed around the country

17:50.982 --> 17:52.288
and authorities are cautioning

17:52.332 --> 17:55.030
that citizens
should not approach

17:55.074 --> 17:56.249
this new...

18:10.611 --> 18:13.004
There you are, Francis.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.659
The guests will arrive shortly.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.883
Well, you look marvelous.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.103
You're marvelous, Ma...

18:27.410 --> 18:28.542
I must compliment you

18:28.585 --> 18:31.284
on your taste
of horn decorations.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.981
Have you met Sir Francis?

18:33.024 --> 18:36.724
He's a very famous explorer,
you know.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.205
And he's not even afraid
of the dark.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.858
At all.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.819
If only we had Mr. Hopper.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.307
Stay there.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.229
Francis, did you do that?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.157
Francis?

20:03.114 --> 20:05.465
You were supposed
to take care of me!

20:05.508 --> 20:06.553
That's your job!

20:06.596 --> 20:08.250
Dad says you're the big brother

20:08.294 --> 20:09.860
and you take care
of Stephanie.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.122
It's your fault.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.081
They left because of you!

20:13.124 --> 20:15.910
They'd still be here
if you hadn't died!

20:15.953 --> 20:18.304
It's your fault!

22:52.109 --> 22:54.764
Okay, you stay there.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.026
You can do this.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.464
Keep a lookout
for anything weird.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.118
I believe in you.

23:01.162 --> 23:04.383
I'll only take a minute.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.313
Did you hear that?

25:33.749 --> 25:36.273
Shh...

28:04.160 --> 28:06.075
Oh, my God.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.296
Stephanie.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.819
Daddy!

28:10.863 --> 28:13.256
- Come here, baby.
- Come here, baby.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.997
I got you.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.696
Yeah.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.698
I got you.
I got you, princess.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.179
We're here.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.311
Let me see your face.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.486
Let me see you.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.879
You okay?

28:26.922 --> 28:28.358
Yeah?

28:28.402 --> 28:30.012
Look at you.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.274
You're okay.

28:31.318 --> 28:33.015
My princess.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.062
That's my girl.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.716
I'm sorry.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.764
I got ya.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.331
Come on, baby.

32:21.548 --> 32:23.637
Paul?

32:30.339 --> 32:33.342
How are you gonna find
your way home?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.189
Stephanie.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.451
Sweetheart! Stephanie!

32:55.495 --> 32:57.149
- Steph!
- Stephanie!

33:00.804 --> 33:02.110
Stephanie!

33:02.154 --> 33:03.677
Steph!

33:07.202 --> 33:11.032
Stephanie! You are not to leave
our sight, young lady!

33:11.076 --> 33:12.164
Don't.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.992
- She needs to listen.
- I said, don't.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.908
Stay calm.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.693
Both of you.

33:19.736 --> 33:23.262
Baby, it's really dangerous
for you to be out there, okay?

33:24.741 --> 33:28.049
Why did you take Paul away?

33:28.093 --> 33:30.573
I want him to come home.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.347
Hi, princess.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.566
Hi, Daddy.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.831
- I'm gonna make us breakfast.
- Okay.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.790
Did you sleep well?

34:13.833 --> 34:15.226
Mm-hmm.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.621
The lights are back on.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.232
Yeah. Your, um,

34:20.275 --> 34:22.321
your father messed
with the breaker.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.757
More?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.063
Mm-hmm.

34:26.411 --> 34:28.717
What's he building?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.155
Oh, you know your dad.

34:30.197 --> 34:32.983
He would rebuild
the Panama Canal if he could.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.685
Why did you leave me?

34:47.346 --> 34:49.304
Stephanie,
you have to understand

34:49.348 --> 34:50.652
that your dad and me,

34:50.697 --> 34:54.701
we never would have left you
here alone if...

34:54.744 --> 34:56.137
We thought that...

34:56.181 --> 34:58.705
You thought
that the monster got me, too.

35:02.491 --> 35:03.884
Yeah.

35:03.927 --> 35:06.278
It still comes
sniffing around.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.194
It's in the woods.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.934
But if we get upset,

35:10.978 --> 35:12.806
it comes into the house.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.417
What do you do then,
when it comes in the house?

35:15.461 --> 35:17.115
We get totally quiet.

35:17.158 --> 35:20.292
Me and Francis are aces
at hiding from it.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.946
Aces.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.165
Mm-hmm.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.126
Steph, you're one tough kid,
you know that?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.563
Not really.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.133
Really, I'm pretty scared.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.161
What do you think?

36:03.204 --> 36:05.511
For the monster?

36:05.554 --> 36:06.860
Yes.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.299
Do you think it's strong
enough to keep it out?

36:16.391 --> 36:18.132
Well,

36:18.176 --> 36:19.786
it's pretty good anyway.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.615
Thanks.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.399
I think so, too.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.358
I like it
when you build stuff.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.837
Is that so?

36:27.881 --> 36:29.361
Mm-hmm.

36:33.408 --> 36:34.670
Can I ask you a question?

36:34.714 --> 36:36.455
Sure.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.284
What happened to Mr. Hopper?

36:40.589 --> 36:43.288
Well, he...

36:43.331 --> 36:44.506
Honey!

36:44.550 --> 36:46.552
Can you come inside
for a minute?

36:46.595 --> 36:48.249
Yeah.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.948
You stay here.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.299
Clear.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.430
Clear?

36:55.474 --> 36:57.563
Crystal.

37:02.089 --> 37:03.177
You stay here.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.310
Clear?

37:05.353 --> 37:08.313
Clear? Okay.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.543
So what's Atlanta
saying about the new protocols?

37:21.587 --> 37:23.980
The CDC
has no comment at this time.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.026
You've seen the news.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.289
The president...
is weighing all options.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.770
There are rumors online
that they've had some success

37:30.813 --> 37:33.033
at the containment facility
in Mumbai.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.731
Yeah, rumors but...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.733
what's going on?

37:39.344 --> 37:40.867
Jane, I've never seen you
like this.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.391
Are Paul and Stephanie okay?

37:51.094 --> 37:53.140
It's cool.
It's impossible not to worry

37:53.183 --> 37:55.838
about all of our kids.

37:55.882 --> 37:59.494
Look, can you talk me through
the isolation protocol?

38:00.756 --> 38:02.671
Three!

38:02.715 --> 38:05.108
Two! One! Popcorn!

38:05.152 --> 38:07.589
Done! Bam!

38:07.633 --> 38:09.330
Eh-eh-eh!
Eh-eh-eh.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.159
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.116
Ah, shit.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.509
- Dad!
- Oh! Sorry.

38:14.553 --> 38:15.989
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.776
Fantastic.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.212
Salt!

38:22.256 --> 38:23.562
Good. Taste.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.348
Good.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.697
Give me some love.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.790
You almost done
with that fence?

38:34.834 --> 38:36.662
Probably tomorrow.

38:37.663 --> 38:38.751
Good.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.626
Ah, so they tell me.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.760
Steph, what's Francis doing?

38:47.803 --> 38:49.196
Dancing.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.503
Oh baby, turtles can't dance.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.940
Don't listen to her, Francis.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.203
Show her your special dance.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.683
His special... Oh!

38:57.726 --> 38:59.249
Oh!

38:59.293 --> 39:01.643
That is not a special dance!

39:01.687 --> 39:03.297
That is tickle!

39:03.341 --> 39:04.342
Oh, Francis,

39:04.385 --> 39:05.691
you're Fran-tastic.

39:05.734 --> 39:06.779
I don't get it.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.607
I do!

39:08.650 --> 39:10.522
I don't get it.

39:10.565 --> 39:14.613
- Francis is Fran-tastic.
- Francis into fantastic.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.528
But the word is fantastic.

39:17.964 --> 39:19.661
Fantastic. It's not Fran-tastic.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.489
It's Fran-tastic.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.767
Be right back.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.203
Okay.

40:05.315 --> 40:08.623
Why, baby. Why?

40:08.667 --> 40:10.886
It's okay, it's okay.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.801
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.587
I know.
Take your time.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.025
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I got you.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.767
I got you.

40:23.595 --> 40:25.248
Come on. Come on.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.227
How did Paul come back?

40:55.409 --> 40:57.542
Did the monster bring him?

40:57.585 --> 40:59.587
Yes.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.893
Why?

41:02.590 --> 41:05.550
We don't really know why it does
any of the things it does.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.945
Maybe we should leave.

41:13.209 --> 41:16.125
I think it would just
come after us, princess.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.997
After me?

41:18.040 --> 41:20.129
Yes.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.221
It wants me, right?

41:25.265 --> 41:28.311
That's why
it keeps coming back.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.490
Yes.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.756
You used to say there's
no such thing as monsters.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.671
I know.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.936
I'm sorry.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.855
I was wrong.

41:53.293 --> 41:54.860
May I be excused?

44:31.669 --> 44:32.887
Hey, princess.

44:32.931 --> 44:34.367
Hey, Dad.

44:36.848 --> 44:38.676
Can we talk?

44:40.808 --> 44:43.724
Your mother's sorry
for losing her temper.

44:43.768 --> 44:46.596
- No big deal.
- Mmm, no, it is a big deal.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.337
All of us have to watch

44:48.381 --> 44:50.078
what we do, how we feel.

44:50.122 --> 44:52.298
You included.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.082
Because that will make
the monster come.

44:54.126 --> 44:56.258
Mm-hmm.

44:56.302 --> 44:59.261
We didn't mean to upset you.

44:59.305 --> 45:01.046
And that's why
we didn't wake you up

45:01.089 --> 45:02.438
when we took Paul away.

45:02.482 --> 45:05.224
And maybe that was wrong,
I don't know.

45:05.267 --> 45:07.313
Parents aren't perfect.

45:07.356 --> 45:09.054
That's the sad truth.

45:12.927 --> 45:14.973
Why did you leave me here?

45:20.456 --> 45:23.851
We were afraid, how's that?

45:23.895 --> 45:25.070
I was afraid.

45:25.113 --> 45:27.333
Of what?

45:27.376 --> 45:28.726
Don't lie.

45:33.861 --> 45:36.211
I was afraid of myself, maybe?

45:36.255 --> 45:38.910
That I wouldn't be strong enough

45:38.953 --> 45:40.128
to take care of the things

45:40.172 --> 45:42.304
that I need to take care of.

45:42.348 --> 45:43.958
What do you need to do?

45:44.002 --> 45:45.264
Well, that's the scary part,

45:45.307 --> 45:47.701
I'm not quite sure.

45:47.745 --> 45:48.876
Can I help?

45:50.356 --> 45:52.401
Maybe, princess.

45:54.273 --> 45:57.015
You're strong, Stephanie.

45:57.058 --> 46:00.192
I'm talking about
strength up here.

46:00.235 --> 46:02.194
Strength on the inside.

46:02.237 --> 46:04.283
Your mommy and me,
we made you.

46:04.326 --> 46:06.720
We made your eyes that color

46:06.764 --> 46:09.636
and we made your hair
straight and blonde.

46:09.679 --> 46:10.811
That's what we did.

46:10.855 --> 46:13.553
We made everything out here.

46:13.596 --> 46:17.035
But up here, on the inside,
that's all you.

46:17.078 --> 46:18.210
All the way.

46:18.253 --> 46:19.559
The good and the bad,

46:19.602 --> 46:22.040
that's for you to control.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.563
That's for you to change,

46:23.606 --> 46:24.912
if you want to.

46:24.956 --> 46:28.611
The fear and the anger
and the doubt,

46:28.655 --> 46:31.005
they're what call the monster.

46:31.049 --> 46:33.616
And when you get those feelings,
the bad feelings,

46:33.660 --> 46:36.010
all you have to do
is make them small.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.838
That's how you beat it.

46:37.882 --> 46:39.666
That's the number one rule.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.276
Don't let
the bad things get big,

46:41.320 --> 46:43.061
everything will be fine.

46:43.104 --> 46:44.453
You get it?

46:44.497 --> 46:46.238
Mm-hmm.

46:48.675 --> 46:51.504
Now, I'm betting locked up
inside that head of yours,

46:51.547 --> 46:54.637
you have enough strength
to stop that monster cold.

47:03.908 --> 47:05.170
Dunk.

47:18.705 --> 47:20.098
You all right?

47:20.141 --> 47:21.664
Mm-hmm.

47:39.421 --> 47:41.641
I love you, Daddy.

47:54.045 --> 47:56.177
She's lived longer
than any of them, right?

47:56.221 --> 47:58.876
Yeah.

47:58.919 --> 48:00.921
Do you really believe

48:00.965 --> 48:03.097
that she isn't gonna end up
like the rest of them?

48:03.141 --> 48:05.317
I talked to her,
she can keep herself calm.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.362
- She's a tough kid.
- You talked to her.

48:07.406 --> 48:09.538
Maybe it is,

48:09.582 --> 48:11.192
I don't know, we don't know.

48:11.236 --> 48:12.454
We have to protect her.

48:12.498 --> 48:13.891
This procedure, I can do it,

48:13.934 --> 48:15.675
- I can keep her safe.
- You're not

48:15.718 --> 48:17.459
that kind of doctor,
it's too dangerous,

48:17.503 --> 48:20.114
the procedure could kill her.

48:20.158 --> 48:22.725
The best thing to do
right now is we just wait.

48:22.769 --> 48:24.336
That's all I'm asking you
to do is wait.

48:24.379 --> 48:26.164
- Wait for what?
- What if she can't?

48:26.207 --> 48:27.817
You've seen
what those things can do.

48:27.861 --> 48:30.342
Yeah. I've seen it,
in my house.

49:15.865 --> 49:16.910
Mom?

49:16.954 --> 49:18.129
Dad?

50:12.835 --> 50:14.011
Mom?

50:14.054 --> 50:15.664
Dad?

50:37.643 --> 50:39.036
Daddy?

50:40.602 --> 50:41.734
Daddy!

50:41.777 --> 50:43.170
Hi, princess.

51:46.451 --> 51:48.235
Mom?

51:48.279 --> 51:49.584
Dad?

52:04.164 --> 52:05.470
No!

52:10.170 --> 52:12.912
Steph!

52:12.955 --> 52:15.480
All right, take it easy,
she's fine, she's fine.

52:15.523 --> 52:18.700
Look at me,
you got to stay calm. Okay?

52:18.744 --> 52:19.701
The monster killed you.

52:19.745 --> 52:21.094
Nobody killed me.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.009
Listen to me, baby,
you got to stay calm.

52:23.052 --> 52:24.663
No, Daddy, the basement.

52:27.796 --> 52:29.146
Run!

52:31.104 --> 52:33.150
- Daddy! Dad!
- Shh! Shh, shh...

52:33.193 --> 52:34.934
Daddy!

52:49.862 --> 52:51.211
All right, it's okay.

52:51.255 --> 52:53.822
It's okay. It's okay.

52:53.866 --> 52:56.042
Shh! We have to be quiet.

52:56.085 --> 52:58.175
The monster might hear us.

53:41.914 --> 53:43.655
We did it.

54:17.950 --> 54:20.082
Come on, it's clear.

54:21.475 --> 54:23.347
Mom!

54:45.586 --> 54:47.458
Ow. Ow.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.636
Francis.

55:00.035 --> 55:02.516
Stephanie! Wait!

55:10.132 --> 55:11.612
Stephanie!

55:26.235 --> 55:28.107
The monster!

55:30.588 --> 55:31.545
The monster! The monster!

55:31.589 --> 55:33.808
I'm sorry.

55:33.852 --> 55:35.375
I'm sorry, it's you.

55:35.419 --> 55:37.246
It's you.

55:41.599 --> 55:43.949
The monster is you.

56:33.955 --> 56:36.393
Baby, how'd you sleep?

56:36.436 --> 56:38.133
I had a weird dream.

56:38.177 --> 56:39.961
Oh, I'm sorry.

56:40.005 --> 56:42.486
Your mom will be back

56:42.529 --> 56:44.488
in a little while, she had
a meeting at the hospital.

56:44.531 --> 56:47.316
Sure.

56:48.361 --> 56:49.623
Hey, Paul.

56:49.667 --> 56:52.060
Hey, Steph.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.325
I don't wanna remember.

56:56.369 --> 56:58.589
I don't want to remember.

56:58.632 --> 57:00.286
It's okay.

57:00.329 --> 57:01.896
You're all right.

57:04.682 --> 57:05.813
I'm sorry.

57:05.857 --> 57:07.293
You don't have to apologize.

57:07.336 --> 57:09.251
But what are you sorry for?

57:10.427 --> 57:12.733
I won't run away again.

57:12.777 --> 57:14.474
You're sick.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.433
You have something inside you.

57:16.476 --> 57:18.652
It's making you see things.

57:18.696 --> 57:21.612
It's making you do things.

57:21.655 --> 57:25.180
Part of what it's making you do
is hurting your memory.

57:25.224 --> 57:26.878
We think if you can remember,

57:26.921 --> 57:28.749
it'll help you fight it.

57:28.793 --> 57:30.838
Your mother and I
have been talking

57:30.882 --> 57:33.841
and there's something

57:33.885 --> 57:35.016
we'd like to try with you.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.148
Like an experiment.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.932
More like a game.

57:37.976 --> 57:40.979
Mm-hmm.

57:42.110 --> 57:44.504
I need you
to close your eyes.

57:44.548 --> 57:46.288
Go on.

57:46.332 --> 57:49.248
I want you to listen
to these clicks.

57:53.818 --> 57:56.995
Let your body relax.

57:57.038 --> 58:00.259
Good. Let your mind wander.

58:01.739 --> 58:03.131
That's it.

58:03.175 --> 58:06.526
Let it go.

58:06.570 --> 58:09.268
Tell me what happened
the day Paul died.

58:09.311 --> 58:11.009
Tell me what happened
that morning.

58:12.967 --> 58:14.534
We're carving pumpkins.

58:14.578 --> 58:15.753
That's right.

58:15.796 --> 58:18.320
That's, that's good, princess.

58:18.364 --> 58:20.105
He's being mean.

58:20.148 --> 58:21.410
Teasing me.

58:21.454 --> 58:24.326
I think he was just playing
with you.

58:24.370 --> 58:26.067
What happened next?

58:28.069 --> 58:29.723
Cut it out!

58:29.767 --> 58:31.725
- I got mad.
- Sure, you did.

58:31.769 --> 58:33.161
Of course, you did.

58:33.205 --> 58:34.859
And that's okay.

58:34.902 --> 58:36.861
What happened after you got mad?

58:36.904 --> 58:38.297
I went for him.

58:41.822 --> 58:43.563
How?

58:43.607 --> 58:45.130
With my arms.

58:45.173 --> 58:48.350
All of them.

58:51.963 --> 58:53.442
What happened after that?

58:53.486 --> 58:55.619
I hit Mommy.

58:55.662 --> 58:57.055
Okay, stop. Stop.

58:57.098 --> 58:59.013
- Just stop.
- You ran!

59:01.973 --> 59:04.845
You left me.

59:04.889 --> 59:07.195
Okay, Eric, stop it, now!

59:07.239 --> 59:11.156
What happened next?

59:11.199 --> 59:12.766
Stephanie!

59:12.810 --> 59:14.028
Stephanie!

59:28.565 --> 59:31.306
Yes. I'm Stephanie.

59:34.658 --> 59:36.398
I am Stephanie.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.539
You happy?

59:46.583 --> 59:48.410
You think she can control that?

59:48.454 --> 59:51.196
- We do it your way.
- Thank you.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:14.959
That's still
our little girl in there.

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.313
Stephanie?

01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:26.057
Princess?

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.499
What's next?

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:36.981
If you take the razor,

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.811
and just...

01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:42.987
just shave
this section right here.

01:00:58.437 --> 01:01:00.308
Yeah.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.838
You okay?

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:09.448
Yeah.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:19.937
Jesus Christ.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.416
Actually,
it's relatively simple.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.418
As soon as we get
through the bone,

01:01:23.462 --> 01:01:24.724
we feed the endoscope through.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.639
There's a natural pathway
for it to follow.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.597
If this doesn't work?

01:01:29.947 --> 01:01:31.644
It's going to work.

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:15.775
Tragedy unfolding in Mumbai.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.995
We are now expecting
confirmation

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:19.518
from the White House.

01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:22.347
There has been
an incident in the lab,

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.305
where the rumored
surgical trials

01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:25.916
are being conducted.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:27.787
The death toll is unconfirmed,

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:30.529
but there were at least
200 physicians

01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:32.139
and researchers gathered

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.793
by the coalition of nations,

01:02:33.837 --> 01:02:35.926
at the facility.

01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:40.017
With all the therapeutic
containment efforts failing,

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.715
this surgery was viewed,
by many researchers,

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.371
as our last best hope
to finding a cure,

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.765
a hope that is now fading.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.244
The nation and the world

01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:52.856
are reckoning
with what some fringe elements

01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:54.379
of the scientific community

01:02:54.422 --> 01:02:56.816
have been saying
since the initial outbreak

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.035
in April,

01:02:58.078 --> 01:03:00.385
that euthanasia may be

01:03:00.428 --> 01:03:02.779
the only cure.

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.014
"Once upon a time,

01:04:04.057 --> 01:04:07.321
in a place
just beyond our sight,

01:04:07.365 --> 01:04:11.021
there lived a magical kingdom
called Anywhere.

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:13.675
In Anywhere,
anything was possible."

01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:58.128
Hey, Steph.

01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:00.957
Do you wanna come for a walk
in the orchard with me?

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:04.786
Come on.

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:08.225
Okay.

01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:32.075
I made you
some hot chocolate.

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:45.566
We haven't been out
to the orchard in a while.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.177
Mm-hmm.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.051
Do you think we can make
some orange juice?

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.748
For all three of us?

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.185
I don't see why not.

01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:57.013
Okay.

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.826
I did that.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:30.742
- No, baby.
- Yes, I did.

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:33.223
But you don't remember doing it.

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:35.660
Well, then it wasn't you.

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.793
What's wrong with me?

01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:41.100
Imagine you're a door,

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.232
and there's something

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:43.885
that's trying
to come through.

01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:45.148
What is it?

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:47.889
We don't know.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:50.109
Something we don't understand.

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.719
Something,

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:54.157
from another place.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.595
I don't even think
it has a body.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:58.857
That's why it uses yours.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.337
It changes you.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.382
And you're not alone,
there's kids like you

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:03.949
all over the world.

01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:06.082
Can they stop it?

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:10.738
There's one more thing
we're gonna try.

01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:11.913
I'm sorry.

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:13.219
No, stop apologizing...

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:15.439
- But I'm sorry.
- Don't be!

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:18.529
Don't be sorry.

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:19.921
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:22.707
Not one day in your life.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.926
Do you understand me?

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:32.978
I think it's getting cold.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.719
It's getting cold.

01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.198
We should drink up.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:39.332
Wait.

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:44.162
Don't forget cheers, Dad.

01:08:45.643 --> 01:08:47.688
Cheers.

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:14.801
Dad, wait. I, I can stop it.

01:09:14.845 --> 01:09:17.979
Dad. No, don't.

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:26.553
See? I can stay calm.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.180
I love you, Daddy.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:47.487
You are my baby girl.

01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:49.010
You're my princess.

01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:53.711
I love you so much.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.336
Stephanie...

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:15.559
Steph

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:21.608
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:22.234
Ah.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.890
Oh, what did I do?

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:32.984
Oh, it's over,
I loved her. Oh.

01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:26.559
My God.

01:12:26.603 --> 01:12:27.691
- Upstairs.
- No, no!

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.475
- Go! Go upstairs.
- No, no!

01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:31.042
- Go!
- No!

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:50.409
Princess... oh.

01:14:17.365 --> 01:14:19.933
Stop! St... Stop!

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.417
You tried to kill me.

01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:28.812
You're not my daughter.

01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:34.992
What the hell are you?

01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:37.995
Big.

01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:49.049
Stay there. Clear?

01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:51.835
Good.

01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:59.059
No! I'm so... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:24.998
We should have never left you.

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.871
You shouldn't have come back.
