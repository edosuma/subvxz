WEBVTT

00:05.835 --> 00:07.569
Yeah, I want to
get out, too.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.471
That's your summer,
school and work.

00:09.505 --> 00:11.606
Those are the
choices you made,
so live with it.

00:11.641 --> 00:13.408
Good morning, Ben.

00:13.442 --> 00:14.609
Good morning...

00:14.644 --> 00:16.845
I'm Ben's cousin.

00:16.879 --> 00:18.647
And who's this?

00:18.681 --> 00:20.548
I'm not Grace's cousin.

00:20.583 --> 00:21.883
I'm her brother.

00:21.918 --> 00:23.551
He's not my brother.

00:23.586 --> 00:24.786
Who told you
he's my brother?

00:24.820 --> 00:27.789
I thought we were this
upstanding Christian family

00:27.823 --> 00:30.725
but as it turns out,
we're just as screwed up
as everyone else.

00:34.764 --> 00:37.766
Dylan and her friends
have been at school
with Ben all day.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.434
All day?

00:39.468 --> 00:41.036
I'm just trying
to be a friend.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.471
Well, if you like Jacob,
and you're on his side,
then you are not my friend.

00:43.506 --> 00:47.676
So you're basically just
breaking up with me and Jesse
for a second time?

00:47.710 --> 00:50.779
I'd like to look at it
more as I'm letting go.

00:50.813 --> 00:52.747
You want to
go out with Dylan,
go out with Dylan.

00:52.782 --> 00:54.516
I know there's
a catch to this.

00:54.550 --> 00:55.817
There is a catch to this.

00:55.851 --> 00:57.886
You're responsible for
anything that happens.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
And I'm not.

Oh, Ben,

03:25.468 --> 03:27.569
Yeah, and he smells nice.
I can smell him from here.

03:27.603 --> 03:28.703
Thanks, Dad.

03:28.737 --> 03:30.538
So, where are you
taking her?
Geoff's.

03:30.573 --> 03:31.806
Did you make
a reservation?
You need me to call?

03:31.841 --> 03:34.642
No, Dad.
I don't need you to call.
I made a reservation.

03:34.677 --> 03:36.578
Well, we hope
you have a wonderful time.

03:36.612 --> 03:39.747
Oh, dear.
Did I just say "we?"

03:39.782 --> 03:42.584
I'm sorry.
It's embarrassing.

03:43.686 --> 03:44.886
Aw, come on,
I think we can say we

03:44.920 --> 03:46.888
if we want to say we,
can't we?

03:46.922 --> 03:48.656
Come on, you two
are disgusting.

03:48.691 --> 03:50.758
I'll see you around midnight.
She has a curfew.

03:50.793 --> 03:54.562
Just make sure you,
uh... Never mind.

03:54.597 --> 03:56.865
I said I was going to
leave you alone and let you

03:56.899 --> 03:59.667
I'll leave you alone

04:00.469 --> 04:01.903
Just remember to, uh...

04:04.773 --> 04:07.509
Have a good time.
Have a good time.

04:07.543 --> 04:08.710
But not too good of a time.

04:09.745 --> 04:10.845
Good night.

Bye.

04:15.584 --> 04:16.885
He's so grown up.

04:16.918 --> 04:19.821
He's grown up all right.
He's been married,
he's lost a child,

04:19.855 --> 04:23.625
and his divorce papers
are sitting over there
on my desk.

04:23.659 --> 04:25.660
And he doesn't know?

04:25.694 --> 04:28.663
Seemed like the wrong night
to give them to him.

04:28.697 --> 04:29.697
Yeah.

04:29.732 --> 04:32.433
I got mine, too.
It's official.

04:32.468 --> 04:35.470
Oh? Well, that's nice.

04:35.504 --> 04:38.540
I mean, you know,
that they finally
came through.

04:38.574 --> 04:41.743
Not that it's not sad, but...

05:28.494 --> 05:31.462
Yeah, she still has to
before it's an actual date.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.632
I know, but once she does,
This is so exciting. dating!

05:34.667 --> 05:36.634
It's a little too exciting.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.403
I just want everyone
to calm down.

05:38.437 --> 05:39.604
This is what
normal girls do.

05:39.638 --> 05:42.307
They go out on dates,
it's no big deal, okay?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.474
Okay, you got
your cell phone?
Yes.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.343
Cell phone's charged?
Yes.

05:45.377 --> 05:46.511
You got money with you?

05:46.545 --> 05:47.745
Yes. I have
money with me.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.282
Okay. You know,
sometimes guys like Ben,

05:51.317 --> 05:54.319
they think that
they are entitled

05:54.353 --> 05:56.554
You've met Ben,
he's not like that.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.389
And there's
no one else like Ben.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.458
No, probably not.

06:00.492 --> 06:02.393
There's probably not
another high school senior

06:02.428 --> 06:04.662
getting divorced
after losing a baby

06:04.697 --> 06:08.399

Yeah, and don't...

Hey! Stop right there,
both of you.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.476
I'll get the door.

06:18.510 --> 06:19.677
No funny business.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.514
No pot smoking,
no fooling around,

06:23.549 --> 06:26.317
dinner and come home.
make out in the driveway.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.485
I know the rules.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.657
Hello, Cecilia.
These are for you.

06:33.492 --> 06:34.525
Oh.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.661
And Dylan,
these are for you.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.298
Smooth.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.333
And the pressure is on.
no one was disappointed.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.735
You're so thoughtful.
Thank you, Ben.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.703
Yes, thank you.
How sweet.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.572
Sweet.

06:47.606 --> 06:49.507
I had Cubans for you,
but Dylan said
you'd given that up.

06:49.541 --> 06:53.711
Yes, I hope to live
long enough to see Dylan
graduate from high school

06:53.746 --> 06:55.647
and then graduate
from college.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.749
And then start her career

06:57.783 --> 07:02.387
and then get married
and then have
my grandchildren.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.455
And in that order.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.691
Not that other people
can't do it in another order

07:06.725 --> 07:09.260
and still turn out to be
very fine people, Robert.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.297
Okay, we better get going.

07:12.331 --> 07:13.631
Midnight.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.467
Or before if you want,
feel free to come home
before midnight.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.436
That's it?
No inquisition?

07:18.470 --> 07:20.672
No, I think
Let's just go..

07:25.444 --> 07:26.511
Oh.

07:30.683 --> 07:31.716
Oh.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.591
(SIGHS)
He's a nice boy.

07:42.294 --> 07:43.494
He's weird.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.501
Hey.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.271
Hi.

07:53.305 --> 07:56.341
I found your mail
we left out for recycling.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.475
Oh. Really?
Yeah.

07:57.509 --> 07:59.510
Wonder how it got there.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.246
(SIGHS) So,
how is your mom?

08:03.282 --> 08:04.382
Fine.

08:04.416 --> 08:05.483
Did you talk to her
about Jacob?

08:05.517 --> 08:07.352
No, not really.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.554
Other than to tell her that
Amy was nosing around
at school today.

08:09.588 --> 08:11.255
Was she?

08:11.290 --> 08:12.490
Yeah, she came up to me
at my locker and she was like,

08:12.524 --> 08:14.659
"I met your brother,
he's so nice."

08:14.693 --> 08:16.594
And?

08:16.628 --> 08:18.663
And everybody was just
standing around waiting
to see what she was gonna say,

08:18.697 --> 08:21.299
and waiting to see
what I was gonna say.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.234
It's like she was taking
my personal tragedy

08:23.268 --> 08:24.635
and putting it on display
for the entire world.

08:26.605 --> 08:31.342
Look, Grace,
I know it was a shock
but it's not a tragedy.

08:32.378 --> 08:33.644
I suffered a tragedy.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.414
That's not a tragedy.
Look, just talk to the guy.

08:37.448 --> 08:40.251
You know you're gonna
talk to him sooner or later,
so just talk to him.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.653
I don't want to talk to him.
And I know what you
went through was a tragedy

08:42.688 --> 08:45.256
but that doesn't mean
that this isn't a tragedy too.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.525
My whole life has been
ruined by this guy.

08:47.559 --> 08:50.461
It's like, it's like
losing my father twice!

08:50.496 --> 08:54.599
Or it could be like
finding your father again.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.467
And your father wouldn't
want you to be like this.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.636
No, he definitely wouldn't.
And he didn't want me
to know about Jacob.

08:58.670 --> 09:01.272
Obviously. 'Cause if he had
wanted me to know,
he would have told me.

09:01.306 --> 09:02.673
Maybe he didn't tell you
because he couldn't.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.642
Couldn't?
Yeah.

09:04.676 --> 09:08.212
Maybe he couldn't.
Look, who knows when
he even found out.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.549
Your family was
always so happy,
you were happy.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.217
If he told you,
he probably figured that

09:13.252 --> 09:14.652
you would never be
happy again.

09:14.686 --> 09:17.288
So whenever he found out,
he just lived with it

09:17.322 --> 09:19.223
and he was the one
who was never happy again.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.626
How do you know?
Maybe he was twice
as happy as the rest of us

09:21.660 --> 09:25.630
and none of us were
ever really happy because
it was all fake, fake, fake!

09:25.664 --> 09:27.498
Where are you going?
We're just talking,

09:27.533 --> 09:29.267
I'm just trying
to talk to you.

09:29.301 --> 09:31.369
Yeah. About Jacob.
And I do not want
to talk about Jacob.

09:31.403 --> 09:32.670
Why won't everyone
just leave me alone!

09:32.704 --> 09:34.672
And why does everybody
want to give him what he wants

09:34.706 --> 09:36.474
but nobody wants to
give me what I want?

09:36.508 --> 09:38.576
Because it's impossible
to give you what you want.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.511
The guy exists,
and you can't
pretend he doesn't.

09:46.685 --> 09:48.319
(SIGHS)

10:18.484 --> 10:19.650
I didn't come by here
to get a lecture.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.353
I just wanted to come
pick up a shirt.

10:22.387 --> 10:25.690
Jeez, all I said to Grace
was that I met Jacob
and he's a really nice guy.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.692
Well, obviously
Grace doesn't want to
talk about him, Ames.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.660
What, did she call you
and cry to you

10:29.695 --> 10:32.396
because I said
something to her?

10:32.431 --> 10:35.466
Oh, please, Wife Number One
called you and said
something to you

10:35.501 --> 10:36.634
because Grace said
something to her.

10:36.668 --> 10:39.437
That is ridiculous!
We're seniors!

10:39.471 --> 10:42.306
We're all grown up now
and Grace still has to have
her mommy call my daddy

10:42.341 --> 10:43.508
because I did something
mean to her?

10:43.542 --> 10:45.309
Just call her
and apologize.

10:45.344 --> 10:46.744
I've got a two-year-old
who wants his
favorite pajama shirt

10:46.778 --> 10:49.413
before he'll go
to bed tonight.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.315
And I haven't eaten,
I'm hungry

10:51.350 --> 10:53.417
and all you care about is
Wife Number One's daughter?

10:53.452 --> 10:54.585
No, that's not
all I care about.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.622
No, it isn't, is it?
She's married you know,

10:57.656 --> 10:59.624
just in case you were
thinking of trying to
get back with her

10:59.658 --> 11:01.392
or anything stupid like that.

11:01.426 --> 11:04.262
Kathleen Bowman-Tsegaye
is married.
For the third time now.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.596
I know that.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.698
Why can't you and Mom
just work things out
once and for all?

11:07.733 --> 11:10.601
Your mother is gallivanting
around Europe with
your sister, and you know...

11:10.636 --> 11:11.669
I know what?

11:11.703 --> 11:13.538
Don't you and Ricky talk?

11:13.572 --> 11:18.276
About Mom being gay? No.
You know why?
Because she's not.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.411
And when would Ricky and I
even have time to talk?

11:20.445 --> 11:21.712
I get up,
I get ready for school,

11:21.747 --> 11:23.548
I get John ready
for his day.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.383
I drop John off,
I go to school,

11:25.417 --> 11:27.752
I go to the nursery
after school, we go home,

11:27.786 --> 11:30.288
we have dinner,
we clean up and we go to bed.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.489
There's no talking.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.291
These are the good old days,
you'll see.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.760
No, I won't see.
Ugh. I have to go.

11:39.431 --> 11:40.565
Call Grace when you
get home, all right?

11:42.634 --> 11:44.735
You're not like seeing
Kathleen or anything, are you?

11:44.770 --> 11:46.571
She's married.

11:46.605 --> 11:47.738
Do you come here
all the time?

11:47.773 --> 11:49.440
Everyone seems to know you.

11:49.474 --> 11:51.442
Yeah, my dad and I eat here
all the time.

11:51.476 --> 11:54.645
Did you ever eat here
with your wife?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.647
With Adrian?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.583
Yeah, we came here
a couple of times,

11:58.617 --> 12:00.718
but I was coming here
long before Adrian.

12:00.752 --> 12:03.321
My mom and dad used
to bring me here
when I was growing up,

12:03.355 --> 12:06.357
so it feels like
a family place to me.

12:06.391 --> 12:09.393
Really, it holds
no special meaning
for Adrian and me.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.329
Did you ever
bring Amy here?

12:12.331 --> 12:14.599
Yeah.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.568
I thought about
going someplace that
neither of us had been before,

12:17.603 --> 12:20.605
but I was nervous.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.473
I don't want anything
to go wrong

12:22.507 --> 12:25.276
especially after waiting
this long to go out.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.344
Me neither.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.745
I hope I haven't
made you uncomfortable.

12:27.779 --> 12:30.481
No. Not uncomfortable really.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.618
Just maybe
a little jealous.

12:33.652 --> 12:34.685
Jealous? Of?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.621
Adrian and Amy.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.423
I mean, you've been through
so much with each of them

12:39.458 --> 12:41.659
and you even
married Adrian.

12:41.693 --> 12:45.396
Believe me,
Adrian and Amy have
nothing to do with us.

12:45.430 --> 12:49.767
Of course not.
As long as you don't have
anything to do with them.

12:49.801 --> 12:53.537
Because I could be
extremely jealous.

12:53.572 --> 12:54.639
I actually
kind of like that.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.574
Really?

12:56.608 --> 13:00.311
Well, you wouldn't be jealous
if you didn't really care
about me, would you?

13:00.345 --> 13:01.445
No, I wouldn't.

13:06.516 --> 13:06.516
+

13:10.552 --> 13:11.786
if he's not even
seeing Kathleen?

13:11.820 --> 13:13.687
That doesn't even
make any sense.

13:13.722 --> 13:16.757
I don't know.
Can we talk about that later?
Or not talk about it at all?

13:16.792 --> 13:18.926
I mean, I'm surprised
he's not taking
some pleasure

13:18.960 --> 13:22.730
in finding out that
her marriage wasn't
so perfect after all.

13:22.764 --> 13:24.899
He always thought that
she one-upped him somehow

13:24.933 --> 13:27.902
by marrying a doctor
and getting a bigger house...

13:27.936 --> 13:29.637
Hey, can you stop that?

13:29.671 --> 13:31.839
Don't we have
an agreement about
not talking in bed?

13:31.873 --> 13:34.742
Um, one, this isn't a bed
until we make it into one,

13:34.776 --> 13:37.711
and two, no we do not
have an agreement
about not talking in bed.

13:37.746 --> 13:38.813
Could we make one?

13:38.847 --> 13:40.614
Ricky, I'm serious
about this.

13:40.649 --> 13:41.749
About what?

13:41.783 --> 13:43.651
I don't want my dad
to go out with Grace's mom.

13:43.685 --> 13:44.819
It's none of our business.

13:44.853 --> 13:46.687
Well, can we make it
our business?

13:46.721 --> 13:47.955
Can't you talk
to him about it?
About Kathleen?

13:47.989 --> 13:49.590
No.
Why not?

13:49.624 --> 13:50.925
Because I don't want
to get involved.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.993
Oh, you'd rather spend
Christmas and holidays

13:53.028 --> 13:55.596
with my dad, Kathleen
and my mom?

13:55.630 --> 13:56.931
Do you know
how miserable
my mom would be?

13:56.965 --> 13:59.900
Maybe she wouldn't be
miserable at all,
and if he's happy...

13:59.935 --> 14:02.837
He would never be happy
remarrying his first wife

14:02.871 --> 14:05.739
and I would never be happy
having Grace as my sister.

14:05.774 --> 14:07.475
Ugh. Can you imagine?

14:07.509 --> 14:09.009
No.

14:09.044 --> 14:11.745
Come on, Ricky,
just point out to him that
it would be a mistake, please.

14:11.780 --> 14:12.847
He'll listen to you.

14:12.881 --> 14:14.615
I don't want to talk
about this, all right?

14:14.649 --> 14:15.883
Not to you, not to him.

14:15.917 --> 14:18.519
Ugh. You don't want
to talk to me
about anything.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.955
Oh, no, I want to talk to you,
I always want to talk to you.

14:20.989 --> 14:22.823
For example,

14:22.858 --> 14:25.593
I'd really like to talk to you
about when you might
want to get married.

14:25.627 --> 14:26.994
If planning a wedding
is too much pressure,

14:27.028 --> 14:30.531
maybe we could just
run off and get married
this summer, elope.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.732
Elope?

14:31.766 --> 14:33.634
Ugh. I don't want to do that.

14:34.903 --> 14:35.903
(SIGHS)

14:43.945 --> 14:46.881
I told her to apologize,
I don't know if she will,
but I gave it a shot.

14:46.915 --> 14:50.551
I just don't think
people realize
how upsetting this is.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.988
I mean,
Grace really needs time
to get used to the idea.

14:54.022 --> 14:56.624
I'm still getting
used to the idea.

14:56.658 --> 14:59.860
It's like I never even knew
who Marshall was.

14:59.895 --> 15:01.862
He was with this woman
for 15 years.

15:01.897 --> 15:06.901
I mean,
it's just unbelievable
and ridiculous and painful.

15:06.935 --> 15:08.636
George, it's very painful.

15:08.670 --> 15:11.872
Yeah. I'm sorry
that happened.
Hey, you don't think...

15:12.674 --> 15:14.475
Nah.
What?

15:14.509 --> 15:15.943
You don't think
that's why doctors

15:15.977 --> 15:17.811
go on all these volunteer
missions, do you?
To cheat on their wives?

15:17.879 --> 15:20.848
No, I don't think that.

15:20.882 --> 15:23.584
Why would any doctor
have to go halfway
around the world

15:23.618 --> 15:24.919
just to cheat on his wife?

15:24.953 --> 15:27.555
Or to cheat on her husband.
I know there are lady doctors.

15:27.589 --> 15:28.856
Is this supposed
to be comforting?

15:28.890 --> 15:30.925
Oh, I thought
you were looking
more for an explanation.

15:30.959 --> 15:34.662
I would like an explanation,
but not from you,
from Marshall Bowman.

15:34.696 --> 15:36.263
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

15:36.298 --> 15:38.899
But if the other husband
is cheating, the new one,
maybe he could explain it.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.034
(SCOFFS)

15:40.068 --> 15:42.570
What?
You're not thinking that?

15:42.604 --> 15:44.972
If I were you,
that'd be the first thing
I'd be thinking about.

15:45.006 --> 15:46.941
Not that I want to plant ideas
in your head or anything.

15:50.879 --> 15:51.912
What'd I say?

15:54.649 --> 15:55.950
What did you say?

15:55.984 --> 15:58.953
Oh, nothing. I was
just talking to Kathleen.

15:58.987 --> 16:00.888
Anne is pretty much
halfway around the world
right now, right?

16:00.922 --> 16:02.790
I don't know. Why?

16:02.824 --> 16:04.725
Next time you speak to her,
ask her if she's
fooling around over there.

16:04.759 --> 16:05.793
Why would I do that?

16:05.827 --> 16:07.895
Because I'm asking you to.

16:07.929 --> 16:10.965
I just wish she could
find someone, man or woman.

16:10.999 --> 16:12.933
Why is that?
She deserves to be happy.

16:12.968 --> 16:14.001
No, that's not it.

16:14.035 --> 16:15.603
All right,
I deserve to be happy.

16:15.637 --> 16:16.770
Yeah, that's it.

16:17.906 --> 16:20.674
You think
you can't be happy
unless she's happy?

16:20.709 --> 16:21.875
Not without feeling
guilty about it.

16:21.910 --> 16:24.712
This family
is so screwed up.

16:24.746 --> 16:27.514
I mean, for people
who don't do drugs or drink,

16:27.549 --> 16:29.550
you're all still
completely dysfunctional.

16:29.584 --> 16:30.851
You've been talking to Amy,
haven't you?

16:30.885 --> 16:32.586
(CHUCKLES)

16:41.696 --> 16:45.799
Oh, you were playing soccer
with Bonnie and Ronnie
all this time?

16:45.834 --> 16:48.902
Yeah, they're pretty good.
And they're cute kids.

16:48.937 --> 16:50.638
I don't know why
Tom doesn't like them.

16:50.672 --> 16:53.540
Oh, he likes them.
He just doesn't want
to be responsible for them.

16:53.575 --> 16:54.875
Oh, well, their mother
just got home

16:54.909 --> 16:56.644
so she'll take care
of them, I suppose.

16:56.678 --> 16:58.612
Yeah, I suppose she will.

16:58.647 --> 17:01.582
And you are calling
your mother
every day, right?

17:01.616 --> 17:02.650
You promised.

17:02.684 --> 17:05.586
Almost every day, yes.

17:05.619 --> 17:08.622
You know, she keeps
asking about Grace
and how she's doing,

17:08.656 --> 17:10.523
I hate to keep lying to her.

17:10.558 --> 17:11.724
I really want
to talk to Grace.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.496
She'll talk to you.
Just give her time.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.598
She won't even answer
a call from me, or a text.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.534
I'm sure she will eventually.

17:20.568 --> 17:22.903
Tom said he'd take me there,
to her condo.

17:22.936 --> 17:24.838
You know if I wanted
to talk to her face to face.

17:24.873 --> 17:28.509
Take you there how?
Tom doesn't drive,

17:28.542 --> 17:30.811
and I'm sure Rachel
doesn't want to take
the two of you anywhere

17:30.845 --> 17:32.646
after she just
got home from work.

17:32.681 --> 17:33.814
Tom said he would drive.

17:33.848 --> 17:36.617
He said he would
drive you or take you?

17:36.651 --> 17:38.952
He... He probably meant
on the bus.

17:38.987 --> 17:40.621
Tom knows
all the bus routes.

17:40.655 --> 17:42.690
He has them
all memorized.

17:42.724 --> 17:45.659
But, Jacob,
I don't want you
over at Grace's.

17:45.694 --> 17:46.727
And I don't want
you and Tom

17:46.761 --> 17:47.961
riding around
all over the city

17:47.996 --> 17:49.697
on a bus
on a Friday night.

17:50.899 --> 17:53.600
Let her come to you
when she's ready
to talk, all right?

17:53.635 --> 17:55.736
I get the feeling
that's not just a suggestion.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.539
No, it's not.
I'm telling you
not to do that.

17:59.908 --> 18:07.514
No offense, but maybe
I'm a little more mature
than American guys my age.

18:07.549 --> 18:10.884
My mother usually
lets me make my own
personal decisions,

18:10.919 --> 18:12.486
my own rules.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.822
Well, if you want
to stay with me,

18:14.856 --> 18:16.857
you have to go by
my rules,

18:16.891 --> 18:18.592
there are gonna be
rules, Jacob.

18:19.461 --> 18:20.461
Yes, ma'am.

18:25.433 --> 18:26.567
Is my husband cheating on me?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.770
Dr. Tsegaye?

18:29.804 --> 18:32.539
Your mother
runs the hospital,
so she would know.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.641
Has she said anything?

18:34.676 --> 18:39.680
Um, I... I think that
if there are
going to be rules,

18:39.714 --> 18:42.783
then maybe there should
also be boundaries.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.819
I, I'm sorry.
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

18:45.854 --> 18:48.555
Same thing that's wrong
with everyone else.

18:48.590 --> 18:51.458
It's me, having me around.

18:51.493 --> 18:52.860
No, it's really
not you, it's...

18:52.894 --> 18:54.661
Me.

18:54.696 --> 18:57.798
Okay, well,
maybe it is you,

18:57.832 --> 18:59.800
but, well, I'm really happy
you're here, I am.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.702
I mean, we needed
to know the truth,

19:01.736 --> 19:03.604
no matter how difficult
it is to deal with,

19:03.638 --> 19:06.807
we needed to know
the truth about
Marshall Bowman.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.510
And I need to know the truth
about Jeff Tsegaye.

19:09.544 --> 19:10.677
Because
for once in my life,

19:10.712 --> 19:12.613
I would like to
not be living a lie.

19:12.647 --> 19:18.752
So if he's cheating on you,
then you have a reason
to dissolve the marriage.

19:18.787 --> 19:22.823
But if he's not,
you have no reason
to dissolve the marriage.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.459
Other than it's just not
what you want.

19:25.493 --> 19:26.693
What happened
to the boundaries?

19:27.896 --> 19:29.696
You are way too smart for 14.

19:41.875 --> 19:41.875
+

19:46.446 --> 19:50.649
Come on,
if I(crash your car,

19:50.683 --> 19:52.451
I'll get you a new one.

19:52.485 --> 19:55.554
But you couldn't get me
a new you if you crashed it.

19:55.588 --> 19:56.789
Tom, you don't drive.

19:56.823 --> 19:58.624
Where'd you hear that?

19:58.658 --> 20:00.626
Well, you don't, do you?

20:00.660 --> 20:04.396
Of course, I do.
I can drive!

20:04.431 --> 20:05.464
A car?

20:05.498 --> 20:08.667
Yes. A car.

20:08.701 --> 20:12.371
My dad let me drive
all the time.

20:12.405 --> 20:13.505
Do you have a license?

20:13.540 --> 20:16.742
Yes. I have a license.
Don't worry.

20:16.776 --> 20:19.478
But, Tom, you're not
on my insurance.

20:19.512 --> 20:22.848
You're not covered
if you should happen to,
you know, hit someone else.

20:22.882 --> 20:27.753
I will pay
if anything happens.

20:27.787 --> 20:31.523
This is important
to my family.

20:31.558 --> 20:34.593
All right, well,
I'll drive him.

20:35.762 --> 20:37.863
I'll take Jacob
to Grace's condo.

20:37.897 --> 20:40.566
Come on,
we'll get the kids,
we'll get Jacob,

20:40.600 --> 20:42.734
and we'll drop him off
while we go get ice cream.

20:42.769 --> 20:45.537
And then we'll go back,
pick him up
and bring him back here.

20:45.572 --> 20:48.640
I want to drive Jacob myself.

20:48.675 --> 20:50.709
And I would like to let you

20:50.743 --> 20:53.712
because I'm tired
and I just want to
get the kids inside

20:53.746 --> 20:55.447
and get them cleaned up,

20:55.482 --> 20:58.550
and give them a snack,
and read to them,
and go to bed.

20:58.585 --> 21:02.654
But you can't drive my car,
Tom, I'm sorry.

21:02.689 --> 21:04.556
Please.

21:04.858 --> 21:05.858
No.

21:13.867 --> 21:16.401
We'll see about that.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:19.606 --> 21:20.672
Hi, Amy.

21:20.707 --> 21:22.608
I just wanted to apologize
about today.

21:22.642 --> 21:25.644
I never should have
brought up, uh, that person.

21:25.678 --> 21:27.880
Especially
when we were at school.
I'm really sorry.

21:29.682 --> 21:31.817
I'm sure that
you're going through
a really tough time,

21:31.851 --> 21:33.585
and if you need me,
I'm sure you'll let me know.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.787
Well, that was really
nice of you, Amy, thank you.

21:35.822 --> 21:36.855
And I will let you know.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.557
I hope you will.
I will.

21:38.591 --> 21:40.592
Because I do consider
you a friend, Grace.

21:40.627 --> 21:41.727
Thank you.

21:41.761 --> 21:45.597
Which makes asking you this
just a little awkward.

21:45.632 --> 21:48.567
But, um, you don't think that

21:48.601 --> 21:51.470
your mom and my dad,
the two of them,

21:51.504 --> 21:53.739
you don't think they're
trying to get back
together again, do you?

21:53.773 --> 21:55.440
My mother is married.

And you know what,
she might be
a little crazy at times

21:58.745 --> 22:01.747
but she's not crazy enough
to leave her husband
for your father.

22:02.649 --> 22:04.516
(HANGS UP)

22:04.551 --> 22:08.820
Uh-huh. Oh, well,
they'll do what
they want to do.

22:08.855 --> 22:11.623
Yeah, none of our beeswax
as my dad says.

22:11.658 --> 22:15.427
Well, they won't
listen to us anyway.
What do we know.

22:15.461 --> 22:18.630
Yeah, I know.
Okay, well it was nice
talking to you, Grace.

22:18.665 --> 22:20.666
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, good night.

22:21.868 --> 22:23.502
She hung up on you, huh?

22:24.804 --> 22:27.506
You weren't going to
find out anything for me.

22:29.676 --> 22:31.476
You could have just
talked to my dad, you know?

22:31.511 --> 22:34.746
Yeah, but I'm not
interested in talking
to him about Kathleen.

22:34.781 --> 22:37.349
But I am interested
in talking to you

22:37.383 --> 22:39.718
about when you think
we should get married.

Amy, come on,
the ring may be
enough for you,

22:42.622 --> 22:44.356
but it's not enough for me.

22:44.390 --> 22:47.426
I don't want to push you,
but I want to get married.

22:52.398 --> 22:53.498
When are you
gonna marry me?

22:53.533 --> 22:55.434
I don't know.

22:55.468 --> 22:56.635
Maybe when you stop
trying to have sex with me

22:56.669 --> 22:58.470
while I'm trying
to talk to you.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.707
You can't keep doing this.

23:01.741 --> 23:03.575
You're going to have to
talk to me at some time
about getting married

23:03.610 --> 23:05.444
or why you don't
want to get married.

23:10.483 --> 23:12.317
Hey, my mom told me
you were here.

23:12.352 --> 23:13.719
Why didn't you text me
or call me or something?

23:13.753 --> 23:15.587
It was kind of nice
being by myself.

23:15.622 --> 23:18.557
Especially
by myself in here.

23:18.591 --> 23:21.627
Remember when we used to
come in here and
sneak around and make out?

23:22.795 --> 23:25.430
It was fun.
Yeah, it was fun.

23:25.465 --> 23:27.666
And we could
do that again if
we weren't just friends.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.401
I need a friend.

23:29.435 --> 23:32.337
What's going on?
Who are you hiding from?

23:33.606 --> 23:36.708
Oh, yeah. The guy that
came home from Africa
with your mom.

23:36.743 --> 23:38.477
That's the one.

23:38.511 --> 23:40.345
All right, well, I guess
you'll deal with that

23:40.380 --> 23:41.480
when you're ready
to deal with that.

23:43.616 --> 23:44.750
He looks like him, you know.

23:45.785 --> 23:48.453
Yeah, kind of.

23:48.488 --> 23:51.356
I couldn't help it.
Come on,
he doesn't look like him.

23:51.391 --> 23:53.458
I mean, I wondered
if he was even
telling the truth.

23:53.493 --> 23:57.396
It's in his eyes,
and in his mannerisms,

23:57.430 --> 24:00.265
and how he digests everything
before he'll say anything.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.534
And his smile.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.704
He has that big smile
like my dad had.

24:06.572 --> 24:08.440
It's going to be all right.

24:10.643 --> 24:13.345
Hey, I know
we're just friends,

24:15.281 --> 24:16.682

make you feel any better?

Can I come in?
Yeah, you can come in,

24:38.471 --> 24:40.405
but I thought
you were hanging
with the guys tonight.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.341
And I thought
you were hanging out
with Grace tonight.

24:43.376 --> 24:44.676
Is Grace here?
No, she's not here.

24:46.512 --> 24:48.580
I tried to talk to her
about her brother again,

24:48.614 --> 24:50.482
and she just can't
deal with it,
so she took off.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.420
Good.

24:55.455 --> 24:56.455
Why is that good?

the place to ourselves.

doing anything tonight.

to have sex, forget it.

25:08.334 --> 25:11.336
I didn't just drop by
to have sex.

25:11.370 --> 25:14.372
I dropped by because
I didn't buy this whole

with the guys" thing.

alone with you.

talk about now?

everything about me.

more than you even
want to know.

about this for starters?

listed as a return address.

It's not that.
Why don't you open it?

there was a reason you
didn't want me over tonight.

uh, called first.

I was on campus today,

27:07.353 --> 27:09.187
uh, yoknow for orientation.

And, and then, and then
some of the kids
invited me out for pizza.

27:12.358 --> 27:16.161
And then after that
I just... I just really
didn't feel like going home.

You know,
this whole thing
is still new for me.

27:18.364 --> 27:21.433

This living alone thing.

Uh, in another month,
you'll be in classes.

27:23.536 --> 27:25.270
That's pretty exciting, right?

Yeah, but it's scary too.

27:28.307 --> 27:31.376

I was thinking maybe I could,

27:31.410 --> 27:35.213
you know, live in the dorms
during the week and then,

27:35.248 --> 27:38.516
uh, you know,
just go to my condo
on the weekends.

if I'm wasting your money
or if it's a good idea.

on the one hand,

hanging out with
the other students,

27:48.494 --> 27:51.363

feel like, you know,
a part of things.

feel like I can blend in.

But on the other hand,

27:57.303 --> 27:59.571
I might not be able
to get any studying done
in the dorms.

27:59.605 --> 28:01.273
What do you think?

28:01.307 --> 28:03.174

whatever you want.

for a semester

have the condo.

We might end up answering
a lot of questions.

And the answer would be
that you just wanted to
show me the butcher shop.

get into any trouble,

29:23.289 --> 29:24.289

a high-tech system.

work around this.

we're not gonna have sex.

kissing me

more exciting than
having sex with
Amy or Adrian.

knocked over that little,
uh, display area.

I'll get you
something to drink.

to drink?

to let me live here

to live together.

31:43.405 --> 31:45.406
"Wanted?" Is that past tense?

31:45.441 --> 31:48.009
Uh, no,
it is not past tense.

31:48.043 --> 31:50.211
We're very happy
living here.

31:50.246 --> 31:54.149
Obviously.
And that's a beautiful
engagement ring, Amy.

31:54.183 --> 31:55.416
When are you two
getting married?

31:55.451 --> 31:57.418
When I stop trying
to have sex with her.

31:59.155 --> 32:00.355
(LAUGHS)

32:01.290 --> 32:02.423
(FAKE CHUCKLE)

32:02.458 --> 32:05.126
I've, uh, I've been trying
to settle on a date

32:05.161 --> 32:08.029
but I haven't even been
able to pencil in
anything on the calendar

32:08.063 --> 32:10.498
because Ricky and I just
can't keep our hands
off of each other.

32:10.533 --> 32:13.101
(CHUCKLES) So thanks
for interrupting us

32:13.135 --> 32:15.103
because now that
Amy's hands are free,

32:15.137 --> 32:16.437
I'll get a calendar
and we can settle
on something,

32:16.472 --> 32:20.241
even if it's just
a time of year,
a season, anything.

32:20.276 --> 32:22.177
So stick around.
Maybe you can help us.

32:22.211 --> 32:24.112
What do you think
would be a good date?

32:24.146 --> 32:25.280
When's a gootime
to get married?

32:26.448 --> 32:28.149
I think we better go.

32:28.184 --> 32:31.186
Yeah, it sounds as if maybe
we came at a bad time.
BEN: Yeah.

32:31.220 --> 32:33.388
(CHUCKLES) Wait.
Ben, how did you and Amy

32:33.422 --> 32:35.256
pick a date
for your wedding
when you got married?

32:39.128 --> 32:40.328
I think it was based
on my due date.

32:42.097 --> 32:44.132
Good night.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.401
Maybe the four of us
can go out some time...
Good night.

32:46.435 --> 32:48.036
(CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY)

32:49.205 --> 32:50.371
You are such a jerk!

32:51.207 --> 32:52.240
Pick a date.

32:53.409 --> 32:55.109
You've been married twice?

32:55.144 --> 32:56.344
Please, please do not be
upset with me.

32:56.378 --> 32:58.012
I forgot that
we did that.

32:58.047 --> 32:59.214
I forgot that
Amy and I got married.

32:59.248 --> 33:00.982
You forgot?

33:01.016 --> 33:02.417
Yeah, it was null and void
from the time we said "I do."

33:02.451 --> 33:04.152
We were underage.
It didn't count.

33:04.186 --> 33:05.987
So, if we ever
got married,

33:06.021 --> 33:07.322
that would be
your third wedding?

33:07.356 --> 33:09.390
Yes, but only
my second marriage.

33:10.259 --> 33:11.326
(SCOFFS)

33:18.100 --> 33:19.300
Did you ever have
sex with Amy?

33:19.335 --> 33:22.136
What? With Amy?
No. No, I did not.

33:22.171 --> 33:23.438
Are you sure
you didn't just forget?

33:23.472 --> 33:25.206
(SCOFFS)
I'm positive
I didn't forget.

33:25.241 --> 33:28.109
Believe me, if I'd
had sex with Amy,
I'd remember...

33:28.143 --> 33:31.045
And that did not come out
like I thought it would.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.313
I never had sex with Amy.

33:32.348 --> 33:35.250
So you've only had sex
with Adrian,
with your second wife?

33:35.284 --> 33:37.085
Amy was not my first wife.

33:37.119 --> 33:38.286
We were never
husband and wife.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.988
Just answer the question.

33:40.022 --> 33:41.356
I spent a summer
in Bologna.

33:41.390 --> 33:42.390
(SCOFFS)

33:48.430 --> 33:52.300
I guess the truth is,
I don't want to be married.

33:52.334 --> 33:55.069
It was a mistake
to get married,

33:55.104 --> 33:57.405
and I don't want to follow
my husband to Africa.

33:57.439 --> 34:00.375
So, I'm gonna tell him that.

34:00.409 --> 34:02.243
Well, you should,
if that's the way you feel,

34:02.278 --> 34:04.312
you definitely
should just say it
and get it over with,

34:04.346 --> 34:07.048
and go on with your life.
You deserve to be happy.

34:07.082 --> 34:08.949
Is that Anne?
I just talked to her.

34:08.984 --> 34:10.118
It's Kathleen.

34:10.152 --> 34:12.353
Sorry. Hi, Kathleen.

34:12.388 --> 34:14.956
Is that Ricky's mom?
Hi, Nora.

34:14.989 --> 34:15.989
She says hi back.

34:18.127 --> 34:22.996
I talked to Anne
and she's very happy
over there.

34:23.032 --> 34:26.400
Uh, she's having
a wonderful time
and she's very happy.

34:26.435 --> 34:30.170
Very happy.
So you should feel
free to be happy, too.

34:35.077 --> 34:36.110
George?

34:36.145 --> 34:38.112
Uh, yeah, sorry,
we got interrupted.

34:38.147 --> 34:39.914
Um, where were we?

34:39.947 --> 34:41.949
You were telling me
that I deserved
to be happy.

34:41.984 --> 34:44.085
Well, you do.
Everyone deserves
to be happy.

34:45.321 --> 34:47.322
Are you happy?
Me?

34:47.356 --> 34:50.391
Hell, no. I'm miserable.
I'd like to do my
whole life all over again.

34:50.426 --> 34:52.193
And given that's impossible?

34:52.226 --> 34:54.128
I'd like to do
parts of it over again.

34:54.163 --> 34:56.164
Yeah, me too.

35:09.011 --> 35:11.379
Can I come in?
I'd like to talk to you.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.081
I'm sorry,
I don't want you to come in.

35:13.115 --> 35:14.248
What the hell did I do?

35:14.283 --> 35:17.185
It's not what you
did tonight, it's just...

35:17.219 --> 35:18.319
...what you did.

35:18.354 --> 35:21.089
I mean, how did you
ever marry that woman?

35:21.123 --> 35:23.391
Camille, I, I had been
so sad for so many years

35:23.425 --> 35:27.328
that I never even
thought of having a life
outside of work and Ben.

35:27.363 --> 35:29.163
And you know that.

35:29.198 --> 35:32.367
And then along came Betty
and she was fun,

35:32.401 --> 35:35.370
and I got a second chance
at having a life
and I took it.

35:35.404 --> 35:39.907
Now it wasn't the life
I really wanted
as it turned out,

35:39.942 --> 35:41.342
but Betty was good to me,

35:41.377 --> 35:43.277
and Betty's probably
always gonna
want to be friends,

35:43.312 --> 35:45.113
and I'm gonna be
friends with her.

35:46.949 --> 35:50.017
I told her not to just
show up again at the house,

35:50.052 --> 35:53.054
but I'm gonna be
friends with her.

35:53.088 --> 35:55.990
And I imagine, eventually,
she'll make a lot of
new friends at school,

35:56.024 --> 35:57.992
and she won't be
around as much, and...

35:58.026 --> 36:01.996
I want to have children.
Just think about it.

36:02.030 --> 36:03.097
Good night.

36:07.069 --> 36:08.102
I love you, Leo.

36:13.142 --> 36:14.208
(SIGHS)

36:15.467 --> 36:15.467
+

36:33.636 --> 36:34.703
It's just not the way things
were supposed to turn out.

36:34.737 --> 36:35.770
It's not the way
you thought things
would turn out.

36:35.805 --> 36:36.271
But a lot of things
are just beyond our control.

36:36.305 --> 36:37.505
Yeah, I know. But...

36:39.542 --> 36:44.446
I grieved the loss of
my baby so intensely that

36:44.480 --> 36:47.482
I think I didn't have
any feelings left
when it came to losing Ben.

36:48.818 --> 36:50.452
Ben is a good guy.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.322
He's not the guy for me,

36:54.357 --> 36:56.558
and I know
we shouldn't be married,

36:56.592 --> 36:58.393
we don't want
to be married,

36:58.427 --> 37:01.696
but I just felt like
such a loser when
I saw this piece of paper.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.335
I know you, and once you
admit to feeling like that,

37:07.370 --> 37:09.771
you'll pick yourself up
and go right back to being

37:09.805 --> 37:14.409
the same confident
and practically
arrogant girl that you are.

37:14.443 --> 37:15.577
The thing is,

37:16.612 --> 37:19.481
it took me so long
to get confident

37:19.515 --> 37:22.751
that I'm afraid
the more times
I pick myself up,

37:22.785 --> 37:25.587
the more times I leave
a piece of me
on the ground.

37:25.621 --> 37:27.355
Well, maybe
there are some pieces

37:27.390 --> 37:28.857
that you want to
leave on the ground
and move on, you know?

37:29.859 --> 37:31.393
Like Ben Boykewich.

37:33.663 --> 37:36.631
I'll put that envelope
back outside...

37:36.666 --> 37:39.401
(CLEARS THROAT)

37:39.435 --> 37:42.570
You and me,
we'll move on
together, all right?

37:43.639 --> 37:45.674
Don't go breaking my heart,
college boy.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.475
Right back at you,
college girl.

37:47.510 --> 37:49.644
Just a few more weeks,
you'll be in college, too.

37:49.679 --> 37:50.712
Hmm.
All right?

37:58.688 --> 38:00.689
Thanks for
following me home.

38:00.723 --> 38:03.558
No problem.
And thanks for
walking me to the door.

38:03.592 --> 38:05.360
Just doing what
a friend should do.

38:05.394 --> 38:06.695
(CHUCKLES)
What?

38:06.729 --> 38:09.497
You look kind of
funny. There's...
(CHUCKLES)

38:09.532 --> 38:10.532
So do you.

38:13.402 --> 38:17.372
You know, I think
I'm gonna like
just being friends.

38:17.406 --> 38:19.474
That was fun,
making out in the car.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.344
It's like a parked car
has its own set of rules.

38:22.378 --> 38:25.380
You can't go too far
'cause of people
walking by on the sidewalk.

38:25.414 --> 38:27.582
I wonder what
the rules are like in there.

38:27.616 --> 38:29.651
Oh, yeah. In there
is off limits.

38:29.685 --> 38:31.619
Oh.

38:31.654 --> 38:33.355
Thanks for letting me
come over.

38:47.603 --> 38:49.671
Good night, friend.

38:49.705 --> 38:52.440
Good night.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.578

with friends hands, I...

(SIGHS)

39:14.630 --> 39:16.598
Where are you going?

39:16.632 --> 39:20.435
Nowhere.
I just thought that
maybe you'd like to talk.

39:21.804 --> 39:24.339
I think we've done
enough talking
for one night,

39:24.373 --> 39:25.573
especially you.

39:25.608 --> 39:27.409
I want to talk.

39:27.443 --> 39:29.544
I want to talk to you
about why you
don't want to get married.

39:29.578 --> 39:30.712
Didn't we just have fun?

39:30.746 --> 39:33.681
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, we just had fun.

39:33.716 --> 39:36.451
But I still can't believe
that you said that
in front of them,

39:36.485 --> 39:38.753
that I won't marry you
until you stop trying
to have sex with me.

39:38.788 --> 39:40.555
Sorry, I couldn't
help myself.

39:40.589 --> 39:41.723
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

39:41.757 --> 39:44.726
I don't want to push you,
but I want to get married.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.694
Tell me what's
really going on.

39:46.729 --> 39:48.863
You've been a little nuts
ever since
I gave you the ring.

39:50.599 --> 39:53.601
What's going on is
I feel like an idiot

39:53.636 --> 39:55.637
getting married
in high school.

39:55.671 --> 39:58.807
I know we have a baby
and I want to get married,

39:58.841 --> 40:01.576
I feel so lucky
that you asked me,

40:01.610 --> 40:05.447
but, jeez, it's like,

40:05.481 --> 40:07.515
I'm already a teen mom,

40:07.550 --> 40:08.750
and if we get married
while I'm a teen,

40:08.784 --> 40:11.719
then maybe we'll have
enough time left

40:11.754 --> 40:13.755
to get divorced
while I'm still a teen.

40:13.789 --> 40:15.590
What makes you think
we'll get divorced?

40:15.624 --> 40:18.393
Look at my family,
I don't want to be
like my mom and my dad.

40:18.427 --> 40:22.730
What about my mom and dad,
the birth ones,
couple of winners there, huh?

40:22.765 --> 40:24.699
Everybody's parents
are screwed up.

40:24.733 --> 40:27.802
So what?
We're not like
anyone else's parents.

40:27.837 --> 40:29.838
We're only like
John's parents.

40:29.872 --> 40:32.774
And we'll make sure
our little family
doesn't end up divorced.

40:32.808 --> 40:36.444
If we get married,
there's always a chance
that we could get a divorce.

40:36.479 --> 40:37.579
But if we never
get married...

40:37.613 --> 40:38.713
I want to get married.

40:39.849 --> 40:41.649
I do, too. (CHUCKLES)

40:45.588 --> 40:46.621

I don't think
this is it, either.

41:11.514 --> 41:13.414
Stop putting
pressure on me!

41:13.449 --> 41:15.416
Tom, I thought you knew
where you were going.

41:15.451 --> 41:18.520
I know bus routes,
I don't know car routes.

41:18.554 --> 41:20.855
Couldn't we just follow
the bus route
you take to the condo?

41:20.890 --> 41:23.625
You should have
thought about that sooner.

41:28.564 --> 41:30.532

41:32.801 --> 41:36.437
Hey, look,
that's a police officer.

We could get
directions from him.

Oh, God, I'm,
I'm going to get deported.

41:42.444 --> 41:44.679

your driver's license.

42:07.536 --> 42:09.470
I can't.
You have to.

a driver's license.
