00:31.964 --> 00:38.764
A subtitle by R3V0LV3R.

00:41.565 --> 00:45.001
There it is,
our house on good old Cleveland Street.

00:45.169 --> 00:48.070
A few winters had passed, and yet
another one had come screaming...

00:48.238 --> 00:50.138
...over Lake Michigan
in the middle of the night.

00:50.307 --> 00:54.403
It had been years since the old man's lamp
stood proudly in our front window.

00:54.578 --> 00:58.070
The legendary battle of the lamp
that locked my parents in mortal combat...

00:58.248 --> 01:00.478
...would forever be etched into my psyche.

01:01.251 --> 01:04.084
This is X-5. I've located the plans
for the moon base.

01:04.254 --> 01:07.280
For my kid brother,
it was all but a distant memory.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.948
I'm going in.

01:09.126 --> 01:12.061
Randy was a fledgling
Buck Rogers fanatic...

01:12.229 --> 01:15.289
...who had his own way of braving
life's little conflicts...

01:15.466 --> 01:17.366
...in this world or any other.

01:17.534 --> 01:19.365
Take that, you Neptunian swine.

01:26.076 --> 01:27.737
Randy, get inside, you lunkhead.

01:27.911 --> 01:29.708
It's freezing out.

01:32.049 --> 01:33.573
And there I am.

01:33.751 --> 01:35.878
With that same dumb, round face...

01:36.053 --> 01:39.284
...and the same penetrating
20-90 vision.

01:39.456 --> 01:41.617
I had, however, discovered the wonders...

01:41.792 --> 01:45.819
...of a miracle elixir called Vitalis.

01:51.201 --> 01:55.661
- Another close call.
- Space is like that, sweetheart.

01:55.839 --> 01:57.568
Now go get dressed for school.

01:57.741 --> 02:01.233
Careful with those,
Zurg's minions are everywhere.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.404
- Oh.
- You just can't trust that son of a bitch.

02:04.581 --> 02:06.105
Excuse me?

02:06.283 --> 02:08.774
Keep it up, young man,
and you're gonna bite the bar.

02:09.286 --> 02:12.278
Oh, yes, don't test me. I mean it.

02:14.024 --> 02:15.685
Oh!

02:16.760 --> 02:18.887
I will not have that in my house.

02:19.063 --> 02:21.361
Did you hear what your brother said?

02:21.532 --> 02:24.433
Where on earth do you boys
pick up language like that?

02:25.035 --> 02:26.730
Son of a bitch!

02:33.043 --> 02:35.944
Gotcha, you bugger! Huzzah!

02:36.113 --> 02:38.775
Oh, I knew that cry.
The most feared furnace fighter...

02:38.949 --> 02:43.283
...in northern lndiana had once again
sampled the sweet nectar of triumph.

02:47.424 --> 02:50.257
We may now begin our day.

02:52.362 --> 02:53.556
Ralphie.

02:53.731 --> 02:56.859
Aside from my sudden
and profound interest in hair...

02:57.034 --> 02:59.093
...things hadn't changed that much.

02:59.269 --> 03:02.261
The old man maintained
his well-deserved status...

03:02.439 --> 03:04.805
...as the White Sox's number-one fan.

03:04.975 --> 03:06.374
Morons.

03:06.543 --> 03:08.568
Another utility infielder.

03:08.746 --> 03:11.977
What about a pitcher who can
make it to the second inning?

03:12.149 --> 03:15.744
I'm telling you, boys, if I owned that team,
things would be a whole lot different.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.413
Yes, sirree, Bob.

03:18.956 --> 03:20.981
Utility infielder.

03:22.359 --> 03:25.795
My mother still hoarded bacon fat
like it was gold dust.

03:25.963 --> 03:29.023
Oh, that's good.

03:29.199 --> 03:31.531
And my brother still left the house...

03:31.702 --> 03:35.069
...wrapped for transport
like he was a Ming vase.

03:35.239 --> 03:37.332
For Pete's sake, Ma.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.237
- I heard you sniffle.
- I can't breathe.

03:39.409 --> 03:42.003
You wanna be sick
when Santa comes?

03:42.179 --> 03:43.976
Oh, how right she was.

03:44.148 --> 03:46.639
For in two weeks, it would be Christmas.

03:46.817 --> 03:48.682
Most guys my age wouldn't admit it...

03:48.852 --> 03:53.084
...but when it came to Christmas,
I still felt like a little kid.

03:55.559 --> 03:56.685
Son of a bitch.

03:56.860 --> 03:58.589
You are pulling my chain.

03:58.762 --> 03:59.922
Rita Hayworth?

04:00.097 --> 04:02.190
See for yourself,
it's playing at the Majestic.

04:02.366 --> 04:04.391
I sat through it three times.

04:04.568 --> 04:06.729
- How naked?
- Thirty percent.

04:08.405 --> 04:11.238
- She pulls off her gloves.
- No.

04:11.408 --> 04:14.900
And then she takes off her necklace.

04:15.078 --> 04:17.774
And then she turns around
and she says, uh:

04:17.947 --> 04:21.644
"I'm not very good with zippers,
but maybe if I had some help."

04:23.587 --> 04:25.384
Oh, my God.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.286
Holy moly.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.688
She's beautiful.

04:30.861 --> 04:32.260
Eh.

04:39.169 --> 04:41.194
Is that a 6?
- Fireball Straight 8.

04:41.371 --> 04:44.738
Overhead valves.
Two-speed Hydra-Matic.

04:44.908 --> 04:47.502
Yeah, so what?
There are a ton of Buicks around.

04:47.678 --> 04:50.841
Show some respect. This is a Roadmaster.

04:51.014 --> 04:54.609
Flick, Schwartz and I
were months away from turning 16.

04:54.785 --> 04:56.810
The sacred moment in each boy's life...

04:56.987 --> 04:59.251
...when he crosses the Rubicon
into manhood...

04:59.423 --> 05:01.721
...and receives that most
cherished of documents...

05:01.892 --> 05:05.020
...known as a driver's license.

05:05.195 --> 05:07.789
Now you're just gonna give it
a little gas, gonna pop that...

05:07.965 --> 05:11.731
Few rites of passage were marked
with such fevered anticipation.

05:11.902 --> 05:13.927
Preparations had been ongoing for months.

05:22.846 --> 05:24.279
Hey, ease up.

05:24.448 --> 05:28.009
You wanna drive the 500,
Indy's right down Route 6.

05:28.185 --> 05:31.348
Don't take the corner in third.
Who's gonna pay for a new transmission?

05:33.557 --> 05:35.422
You're letting this joker cut in?

05:35.592 --> 05:37.423
It's dog-eat-dog out here.
Stake your claim.

05:38.829 --> 05:40.319
Son of a bitch!

05:40.497 --> 05:43.694
But through it all,
the old man remained positive...

05:43.867 --> 05:46.335
...and steadfast in his encouragement.

05:46.503 --> 05:47.595
Stop sign!

05:52.109 --> 05:53.701
Stop sign.

05:54.912 --> 05:57.312
Formal education had to wait.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.177
Being not quite 16
meant that every discussion...

06:00.350 --> 06:02.875
...revolved around only one of two topics.

06:03.053 --> 06:04.645
There were cars, of course.

06:04.821 --> 06:08.882
And then... Oh, yes,
and then there were them.

06:09.059 --> 06:10.424
Drucilla Gootrad.

06:10.594 --> 06:13.859
My sweet Drucilla. Beauty incarnate.

06:14.031 --> 06:16.124
The hands-down heartthrob
of Hohman High.

06:16.867 --> 06:20.064
I didn't stand a chance with her.
No one did.

06:20.237 --> 06:23.400
Unless you were a quarterback
by the name of Todd Chapin...

06:23.573 --> 06:27.270
...a feat which would require developing
strikingly chiseled features...

06:27.444 --> 06:31.346
...and then beating Elkhart Lutheran
on the final play with a 60-yard bomb.

06:31.515 --> 06:34.416
The rest of us, those wretched souls...

06:34.584 --> 06:37.018
...who couldn't throw or catch
or leap or shoot...

06:37.187 --> 06:41.146
...would have to settle for
being with her in our dreams.

06:42.592 --> 06:45.527
Now, then, you will share with us...

06:45.696 --> 06:47.994
...the location of the resistance fighters?

06:49.333 --> 06:53.770
Perhaps I could help
to refresh your memory.

06:58.141 --> 07:00.871
Go ahead, fräulein. Kick and scream.

07:01.044 --> 07:04.377
But your American boyfriends
aren't going to rescue you today.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.511
I ain't her boyfriend.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.678
Not yet, anyway.

07:12.422 --> 07:14.185
Don't try anything fancy, soldier boy.

07:14.358 --> 07:16.690
Oh, yeah? How's this?

07:25.635 --> 07:27.569
You saved me from a fate worse than death.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.000
Just doing my job, ma'am.

07:29.172 --> 07:31.106
Oh, Private Ralphie Parker.

07:31.274 --> 07:34.801
You will forever have
my undying love and affection.

07:34.978 --> 07:36.775
Ditto.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.900
Schweinehund.

07:46.723 --> 07:49.624
My father picked me up from school
that afternoon.

07:49.793 --> 07:52.193
The tired pistons on his beloved Olds...

07:52.362 --> 07:54.728
...were slowly sputtering
into that good night...

07:54.898 --> 07:56.866
...and the time had come for a change.

07:57.034 --> 07:59.867
Any pea-brain can go out
and buy a new car.

08:00.037 --> 08:03.200
But landing a good used one?
You gotta be on your toes.

08:12.015 --> 08:14.313
- That's it. Yeah.
- Okay?

08:14.484 --> 08:17.282
Just remember, treat the
gas like your wife.

08:17.454 --> 08:19.888
Treat the clutch like your mother-in-law.

08:20.057 --> 08:21.081
Huh? Boom!

08:22.993 --> 08:25.587
The old man lived for
the thrill of the hunt.

08:25.762 --> 08:30.358
And there was no one he loved having
in his sights more than Hank Catenhauser.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.128
I had been going with him
to Hank's World of Wheels...

08:33.303 --> 08:35.429
...for as long as I could remember.

08:35.605 --> 08:38.005
Hank drove an ambulance in World War I.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.405
Legend had it he backed over a land mine...

08:40.577 --> 08:44.104
...and still had a piece of shrapnel
the size of a walnut lodged in his brain.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.305
Good to see you!

08:45.482 --> 08:49.077
Hank liked to tell his customers it was
the part of the brain that made deals.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.516
I like you, Parker.
You're an Oldsmobile man.

08:51.688 --> 08:54.851
- Guilty as charged.
- Well, it's a fine automobile.

08:55.025 --> 08:57.016
But you can't drive a great car
till you drive...

08:57.194 --> 08:58.559
- ...a great bargain.
- That's true.

08:59.930 --> 09:03.957
- I got two words for you.
- Olds 88.

09:04.134 --> 09:08.070
- Actually, that's a word and a number.
- Ha! You slay me.

09:08.238 --> 09:11.207
- He's a card. Let's take a sneak peek.
- All right.

09:11.374 --> 09:15.276
Unbeknownst to Hank, my father
and I had perfected a routine...

09:15.445 --> 09:18.710
...carefully orchestrated,
to augment our bargaining power.

09:18.882 --> 09:21.510
Push button radio, white wall tires.

09:21.685 --> 09:23.812
Automatic choke.

09:23.987 --> 09:26.888
Well, why don't you
hop in the back there, sonny?

09:27.057 --> 09:29.855
Just wanna see if that seat's roomy enough
for you and your brother.

09:30.026 --> 09:32.824
Sure thing, Dad.

09:32.996 --> 09:34.361
Hm.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.895
So how is it back there?

09:38.068 --> 09:41.595
Uh, it's okay. I mean...

09:41.771 --> 09:44.604
Ah. A little tight.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.842
Ah, tight. He says it's tight back there.

09:48.011 --> 09:50.138
These kids, they grow like weeds.

09:50.313 --> 09:52.508
Heh. It's certainly a factor.

09:52.682 --> 09:54.650
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to give you...

09:54.818 --> 09:58.879
- ...a heck of a price on it, won't I?
- Well, how about that?

10:27.851 --> 10:29.842
Oh, there she was.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.511
In all her gleaming, second-hand glory.

10:32.689 --> 10:36.455
A 1939 Mercury Model-Eight Convertible.

10:36.626 --> 10:39.789
The top was frayed,
the tires were almost shot.

10:39.963 --> 10:41.726
As if any of this mattered.

10:41.898 --> 10:44.458
For I was in the presence
of the greatest machine...

10:44.634 --> 10:46.727
...ever to glide off an assembly line.

10:46.903 --> 10:49.133
The apex of automobilia.

10:49.306 --> 10:51.740
Holy jeez.

11:13.196 --> 11:16.597
Phase two of the old man's scheme
was always the same.

11:16.766 --> 11:19.564
He'd tell Hank it was time
to go home and think it over...

11:19.736 --> 11:22.000
...let him sweat for a week or two.

11:22.172 --> 11:25.699
And then, like jaguars
circling their hapless prey...

11:25.875 --> 11:28.435
...we'd close in for the kill.

11:28.612 --> 11:32.048
He's over-barrel this time, Ralphie boy.
We got him good.

11:32.215 --> 11:34.274
Oh, you bet, Dad.
The Parker boys strike again.

11:34.451 --> 11:36.112
Hey, you know what they say:

11:36.286 --> 11:38.754
The acorn doesn't fall
far from the tree. Huh?

11:38.922 --> 11:39.911
Huh?

11:40.090 --> 11:43.617
Oh, the old man
was a veritable cliché repository...

11:43.793 --> 11:47.024
...never hesitating to haul out
one of life's tired truisms...

11:47.197 --> 11:48.494
...for our edification.

11:49.633 --> 11:50.793
You know what they say:

11:50.967 --> 11:52.935
If you don't ask, you don't dance.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.162
You know what they say:

11:55.338 --> 11:57.329
Every dog has his day.

11:57.507 --> 11:59.441
You know what they say:

11:59.609 --> 12:03.841
If anything can go wrong, it will.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.642
And one that I begged to differ with:

12:06.816 --> 12:09.979
Lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

12:10.153 --> 12:13.179
Fortunately, I had
the advantage of experience.

12:13.356 --> 12:16.621
I already knew that planting seeds
into one's subconscious...

12:16.793 --> 12:19.318
...was a delicate operation indeed.

12:19.496 --> 12:22.488
You know, I heard that 31 percent
of American households...

12:22.666 --> 12:24.691
...had second cars.

12:25.468 --> 12:28.232
Careful. Don't tip your hand.

12:28.405 --> 12:30.066
Not that we need one.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.730
I just thought it was interesting.

12:32.475 --> 12:34.841
Well, we are living
in prosperous times, I guess.

12:35.011 --> 12:37.605
Oh, yeah, country's on a roll.

12:37.781 --> 12:40.341
Sky's the limit. Ha-ha-ha.

12:40.517 --> 12:43.213
Coach caught Mikey Witlin
eating his boogers in gym.

12:44.187 --> 12:46.437
Still, when Dad's got a
road game in bowling

12:46.438 --> 12:48.988
league or Aunt Clara and
uncle Bill are in town...

12:49.159 --> 12:52.822
Randy, mouth closed when you chew.

12:53.430 --> 12:54.488
Go on.

12:54.664 --> 12:57.690
Heh. Nothing.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.335
I just think it might be nice
to have some extra wheels around.

13:01.504 --> 13:03.802
And maybe you could even get
your driver's license.

13:03.973 --> 13:06.942
Oh, well done.

13:07.110 --> 13:09.078
You know,
that is something to consider.

13:11.214 --> 13:14.206
- What's that?
- Well, what Ralphie just said.

13:14.384 --> 13:17.217
I mean, he is almost 16, right?
And we could...

13:17.387 --> 13:19.082
Wait.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.284
Wait.

13:21.958 --> 13:23.425
Listen.

13:24.794 --> 13:28.457
No. Not now. Anytime but now.

13:29.432 --> 13:31.195
Aah!

13:31.368 --> 13:33.529
It's a clinker!

13:35.672 --> 13:37.139
Aha!

13:39.209 --> 13:42.804
You are mine!

13:42.979 --> 13:45.880
I guess we'll talk about it
some other time.

13:46.049 --> 13:51.316
As the old man would say,
close, but no cigar.

13:54.924 --> 13:57.222
Oh, how I loved band practice.

13:58.094 --> 13:59.925
For 45 minutes, twice a week...

14:00.096 --> 14:02.360
...Drucilla and I could be together.

14:02.532 --> 14:05.126
Not face-to-face, but still close enough...

14:05.301 --> 14:07.428
...to smell her
lavender-scented shampoo.

14:15.845 --> 14:19.281
Someday, my beauty,
there'll be a veil upon that hair.

14:19.916 --> 14:22.316
And I'll lift it, so our lips can meet...

14:22.485 --> 14:24.544
...as they pronounce us man and wife.

14:29.292 --> 14:32.625
A little less holiday spirit, Mr. Parker.

14:36.499 --> 14:37.727
From the top, people.

14:37.901 --> 14:39.664
One, two, one, two.

14:43.206 --> 14:46.073
At least there was one beauty
I had a chance of winning.

14:46.242 --> 14:47.869
One look at my magnificent Merc...

14:48.044 --> 14:51.309
...and the guys would surely be able
to fathom my pangs of longing.

14:51.481 --> 14:52.812
And here's the beauty part.

14:52.982 --> 14:55.542
It's the most gorgeous ride
on the lot, and nobody cares.

14:55.718 --> 14:56.912
Nobody?

14:57.086 --> 14:59.145
No one's paying attention.
She's gathering dust.

14:59.322 --> 15:02.348
I could pick it up for a song, I know it.

15:02.525 --> 15:04.584
Uh, green, right?

15:04.761 --> 15:09.130
Yes. I'm calling her Emerald Express.

15:13.369 --> 15:16.304
Yeah, who wouldn't want that beauty?

15:16.473 --> 15:19.465
But it was in the garage. It was dirty.

15:19.642 --> 15:22.668
Uh, guess he washed it.
Must have a hose somewhere.

15:22.846 --> 15:24.837
Uh, maybe you can borrow it
to hang yourself.

15:25.014 --> 15:27.414
There it was. Taunting me.

15:27.584 --> 15:29.848
Deal of the day
could only mean one thing.

15:30.019 --> 15:33.955
At any moment, hundreds of buyers
would stampede down Hohman Avenue...

15:34.123 --> 15:37.058
...begging to be the first one
to hurl a checkbook at Hank.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.354
Pay to the order of "ruin my life."

15:39.529 --> 15:40.996
Hate to break it to you, chief...

15:41.164 --> 15:45.123
...but wanting and owning
are two different things.

15:45.301 --> 15:49.533
I'd say he had got
a better chance with Drucilla.

15:49.706 --> 15:52.197
- You think it's open?
- Why?

15:52.375 --> 15:54.502
I wanna see what it's like
behind the wheel. Just once.

15:54.677 --> 15:56.838
You kidding? The guy's inside,
you'll get in trouble.

15:57.013 --> 15:59.948
Hey, my dad's like royalty here.
He just sent us a calendar.

16:00.116 --> 16:02.209
Take them. Come on, Schwartz,
take them.

16:02.385 --> 16:03.977
Oh, fine.

16:08.391 --> 16:10.689
Split-bench leather seat...

16:10.860 --> 16:14.853
...Quadra-Coil suspension,
hydraulic brakes.

16:15.031 --> 16:17.591
No. No sense torturing myself.

16:17.767 --> 16:20.531
It was time to say my goodbyes.

16:20.703 --> 16:22.694
So long, old girl.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.897
Got something here, just came in.

16:25.074 --> 16:26.871
Ralph. Ralph.

16:27.043 --> 16:29.807
Absolute mint condition.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.776
Oh. uh...

16:34.484 --> 16:36.782
Hal, this Merc's
got your name written all over it.

16:38.721 --> 16:41.519
Sweet jeepers,
just took it in on the tray.

16:41.691 --> 16:44.751
Hi, kids. How's it going?
Great, take it somewhere else.

16:44.928 --> 16:47.055
Cross my heart.
A grandmother from Muncie.

16:47.230 --> 16:48.993
I guarantee she never took it over 20.

16:55.471 --> 16:58.736
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, my God!
Unh. Unh!

17:03.146 --> 17:04.339
Oh!

17:06.182 --> 17:07.308
Whoa! Move out!

17:28.438 --> 17:30.030
Oh!

17:31.741 --> 17:33.106
Is he all right?

17:36.913 --> 17:38.380
My first test drive.

17:40.216 --> 17:41.513
How'd I do?

17:47.357 --> 17:50.849
Oh...

17:52.328 --> 17:58.289
...fudge!

18:08.411 --> 18:10.538
Yeah, actually it's been
a pretty good year.

18:10.713 --> 18:13.147
Well, until the Three Stooges turned up.

18:13.316 --> 18:16.285
Yeah, ha-ha-ha. You too.

18:17.687 --> 18:20.815
It's only because I go back with your
father I'm not bringing the cops into this.

18:20.990 --> 18:25.086
I could help you close a deal with him
on that Olds. I mean, he really wants it.

18:25.261 --> 18:27.058
We were just trying
to soften you up a little.

18:27.230 --> 18:29.460
Oh, the people you'll stab in the back...

18:29.632 --> 18:31.896
...when you're trying to save
your own skin.

18:32.068 --> 18:33.501
What, you don't think I know that?

18:33.670 --> 18:35.729
"Back seat's a little tight, Dad."

18:35.905 --> 18:38.430
You two have been
trying to pull that since you could walk.

18:41.044 --> 18:42.443
Eighty-five bucks. Cash.

18:42.612 --> 18:44.603
What?
- That's what a new top costs.

18:44.781 --> 18:48.547
- They can have it here next week.
- I can't get $85 by then.

18:48.718 --> 18:52.677
- Well, when do you think you can get it?
- Well, 1970 seems realistic.

18:52.855 --> 18:55.085
- Okay, that's it, I'm calling.
- No!

18:55.258 --> 18:58.455
I will have it. All of it.

18:58.628 --> 19:00.755
No, you won't. You'll never get that much.

19:01.164 --> 19:03.029
You don't say that in front of him.

19:03.733 --> 19:07.533
My friends underestimate the depth of
my resolve and my resourcefulness.

19:08.638 --> 19:09.730
I like this kid.

19:11.274 --> 19:14.937
Determination.
That's what gets things done.

19:15.111 --> 19:17.079
So you get this done by Christmas Eve...

19:17.246 --> 19:22.309
...or the only thing coming down
your chimney this year will be the cops.

19:22.485 --> 19:26.478
It was times like this when you found out
who your friends were.

19:26.656 --> 19:29.921
The treaty that formed NATO
hadn't even been thought of yet.

19:30.093 --> 19:32.994
But on that day,
three young men from lndiana...

19:33.162 --> 19:36.063
...had already formulated
its founding principle:

19:36.232 --> 19:39.258
An attack on one is an attack on all.

19:45.908 --> 19:47.637
This is X-5 to base.

19:47.810 --> 19:51.837
I'm initiating reconnaissance
of General Kotar's evil lair.

19:52.014 --> 19:53.948
Over and out.

19:57.053 --> 19:59.419
Nineteen dollars and six cents.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.988
Well, that's peachy.

20:01.157 --> 20:04.718
- I put in 10, Schwartz. How about you?
- An entire roll of nickels.

20:04.894 --> 20:06.521
That's two bucks, Rockefeller.

20:06.696 --> 20:09.290
Why you barking at me?
I'm not the one that wrecked a car.

20:09.465 --> 20:11.524
Only part of it.
And I wasn't even driving.

20:11.701 --> 20:14.397
So what? You still owe the guy, don't you?

20:17.740 --> 20:21.232
What's most important, Ralph,
is that we...

20:21.410 --> 20:22.468
We are all...

20:22.645 --> 20:24.806
- And come on in, Randy.
- Oh!

20:25.615 --> 20:28.311
Ralphie wrecked a car? Neat-o!

20:28.484 --> 20:32.352
I swear, you rat him out, I will show you
what you look like on the inside.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.422
I swear, if you tell Mom and Dad, I will...

20:34.590 --> 20:37.650
uh, nobody's ratting out nobody.

20:37.827 --> 20:39.351
But he's right.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.293
Someone's gotta pay Hank.

20:42.465 --> 20:45.298
Oh, no. Uh-uh.
I know where this is going.

20:45.468 --> 20:46.560
You gotta tell him.

20:46.736 --> 20:48.260
- No, I don't.
- What, tell who?

20:48.437 --> 20:49.461
His old man.

20:49.639 --> 20:52.802
Give me two minutes,
I want a running start. Ha-ha-ha.

20:52.975 --> 20:55.842
Forget it, Flick. Last week,
I dropped a bottle of Dr. Pepper...

20:56.012 --> 20:58.276
...and he almost took my head off
for blowing the deposit.

20:58.447 --> 21:01.041
- You want me to ask him for 85 bucks?
- Why not?

21:01.217 --> 21:02.548
Jingle bells.

21:02.718 --> 21:04.242
Listen to him. He's all jingly.

21:04.420 --> 21:07.218
Jingle all the way.

21:08.357 --> 21:10.450
- Ha!
- Yeah, chin up, buddy.

21:10.626 --> 21:11.820
We're right here with you.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.962
Yeah, great.
He'll take your heads off too.

21:14.130 --> 21:15.757
Uh, maybe we shouldn't
get involved.

21:15.932 --> 21:19.629
- You know, it's a family matter and all.
- There's no choice, Ralph.

21:19.802 --> 21:21.235
There's tons of choices.

21:21.404 --> 21:22.598
I could, uh...

21:22.772 --> 21:24.865
I could lay low at your house
for a couple of months.

21:25.041 --> 21:28.374
Or I can, uh... Hey, we'll join the Navy.
I could join the Navy.

21:28.544 --> 21:31.479
Or I can... I can change my name
and grow a beard.

21:31.647 --> 21:33.376
Maybe not now, but soon.

21:33.549 --> 21:35.642
Or I can, uh... I can...

21:35.818 --> 21:38.582
- I can't feel my legs.
- Whoa.

21:38.754 --> 21:39.778
That's it. Easy.

21:44.293 --> 21:46.523
So long, kid.

21:47.363 --> 21:49.524
Are you sorry for your sins in your life...

21:49.699 --> 21:52.634
...and do you wish for absolution, my son?

21:52.802 --> 21:55.635
Dead kid walking.

21:55.805 --> 21:58.000
Go out like a man!

22:00.810 --> 22:02.368
No.

22:02.545 --> 22:03.842
No.

22:04.013 --> 22:05.776
No! No, please!

22:05.948 --> 22:07.279
Please, please!

22:07.450 --> 22:09.884
No!

22:15.591 --> 22:19.220
Over the fields we go
Ha, ha, ha, laughing all the way.

22:19.395 --> 22:21.829
Hey, how's it going?

22:21.998 --> 22:25.525
Okay, I guess.
Won't know till we plug them in.

22:25.701 --> 22:28.829
If one of these bulbs is bad,
it makes the whole strand worthless.

22:29.005 --> 22:30.973
Heh. Well, you know what they say:

22:31.140 --> 22:32.607
One bad apple, right?

22:33.943 --> 22:36.070
Yeah, that's a good one, Dad.
A perennial.

22:40.583 --> 22:43.143
I was thinking
maybe we could sort of talk.

22:43.552 --> 22:45.918
You can always talk to me,
Ralph, you know that.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.582
Good.

22:51.594 --> 22:54.586
Could I help you with anything?
Hold the ladder? Mow the lawn?

22:54.764 --> 22:57.164
Uh-oh. I know what that means.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.458
- You do?
- Sure.

22:59.635 --> 23:02.297
It means you need a little extra dough
for Christmas, right?

23:03.673 --> 23:04.833
Sure do.

23:05.007 --> 23:06.599
Well, you're lucky.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.505
I'm feeling extravagant tonight.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.306
Yeah. Why don't you get
something nice for your mother?

23:11.480 --> 23:13.380
Huh? Like perfume or a scarf.

23:13.549 --> 23:16.211
From you and Randy.
I'll give you a buck.

23:16.385 --> 23:18.478
I'll give you 2! Huh? Heh, heh.

23:18.654 --> 23:22.420
Thanks, Dad. That's swell.

23:23.659 --> 23:25.217
Could I have 83 more?

23:28.431 --> 23:29.523
Why?

23:30.766 --> 23:31.790
What?

23:39.041 --> 23:40.201
No way.

23:40.376 --> 23:42.503
No way on God's green earth.

23:42.678 --> 23:44.669
But, Dad, he wants to put me in jail.

23:44.847 --> 23:46.508
Please, I will pay you back double.

23:46.682 --> 23:48.274
Well, you're not gonna have to.

23:49.685 --> 23:52.085
Because there's no way
you're getting it from me!

23:56.792 --> 24:00.660
I could give you the money,
but what would that teach you?

24:00.830 --> 24:03.298
- How generous you are.
- No, no, no.

24:03.466 --> 24:05.229
No kid of mine is growing up thinking...

24:05.401 --> 24:08.768
...that he can get somebody else
to buy his way out of a scrape.

24:08.938 --> 24:10.303
You need some money?

24:10.473 --> 24:12.964
You figure out a way
to come up with some.

24:13.142 --> 24:15.076
Hey, you know what they say:

24:15.244 --> 24:18.543
You give a man a fish
and he'll eat for a day.

24:18.714 --> 24:21.842
Teach a man to fish, he'll eat...

24:23.352 --> 24:24.785
...forever.

24:26.188 --> 24:27.712
Well, just so you know...

24:27.890 --> 24:30.518
...I'm pretty sure any prison stretch
would be minimal.

24:30.693 --> 24:32.251
And if you got on a chain gang...

24:32.428 --> 24:35.829
...you wouldn't have to sit
in your cell all day. Heh-heh-heh.

24:36.065 --> 24:38.192
Wouldn't hurt to ask.

24:48.210 --> 24:49.234
Wait a second.

24:50.746 --> 24:51.872
It's Christmas, right?

24:52.648 --> 24:54.513
Higbee's will hire anybody on Christmas.

24:54.683 --> 24:56.446
We'll go tomorrow.

24:56.619 --> 24:58.610
That's the ticket, guys. Getting jobs.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.585
We'll work our butts off,
12 hours a day.

25:00.756 --> 25:02.781
- Twelve hours a day? I can't wait!
- Yes!

25:02.958 --> 25:07.088
Hank was right.
Determination got things done.

25:07.263 --> 25:10.790
I'd be the kind of part-time holiday help
that legends are made of.

25:10.966 --> 25:12.866
My fellow Americans...

25:13.035 --> 25:16.801
...we are here today to honor
an exceptional young man.

25:16.972 --> 25:20.499
Ralph Parker, once again,
you have set the gold standard...

25:20.676 --> 25:23.008
...for your thousands
of fellow workers to follow.

25:23.179 --> 25:25.773
Please accept this token
of your country's esteem...

25:25.948 --> 25:29.440
...and my personal congratulations.

25:30.286 --> 25:31.310
Thank you, Mr. President.

25:41.797 --> 25:44.095
Drucilla.

25:52.641 --> 25:54.836
Oh!

25:57.847 --> 25:59.644
Bravo!

26:37.953 --> 26:39.978
No! Don't you dare.

26:42.491 --> 26:44.482
Is everything all right, dear?

26:51.667 --> 26:54.568
In the words of boxing great
Jack Dempsey...

26:54.737 --> 26:56.898
...a champion is someone who gets up...

26:57.072 --> 26:59.199
...even when he can't.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.140
Oh, honey.

27:06.315 --> 27:09.182
What am I doing looking for another car?

27:09.351 --> 27:11.911
When what really needs
to be tossed onto the junk heap...

27:12.087 --> 27:15.716
...is that worthless hunk of iron
in the basement!

27:26.468 --> 27:27.457
Friggin'...

27:39.048 --> 27:43.246
Yep. Thing's pretty much on its last legs.
Looks like it came with the house.

27:43.419 --> 27:45.785
It was here when dinosaurs
roamed the Earth.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.549
- The house came later.
- Ha-ha-ha.

27:48.724 --> 27:49.884
So, what'd you have in mind?

27:50.059 --> 27:52.550
We got a sale
on the new forced-air models.

27:52.728 --> 27:55.754
- Ooh.
- Some pretty good prices.

27:57.366 --> 28:01.097
All right. I'm listening.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.065
And good day to you, sir.

28:06.408 --> 28:09.844
If you change your mind, sir,
we're in the book.

28:10.012 --> 28:11.411
Ow!

28:25.427 --> 28:28.521
Would you forget about the furnace?

28:32.901 --> 28:35.699
Hiya, Mrs. Parker.
That time of year again, huh?

28:35.871 --> 28:37.702
I know someone who's pretty excited.

28:37.873 --> 28:40.899
Ha, ha. Been tasting it since October,
has he? Ha, ha.

28:41.076 --> 28:43.670
Well, I saved a special one for you,
nice and plump.

28:43.846 --> 28:45.006
Hang on.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.808
Three-hundred ninety dollars
for a furnace.

28:47.983 --> 28:51.043
What kind of mutton-headed chump
does he take me for?

28:51.220 --> 28:54.417
- He seemed pretty honest to me.
- He's a quack-salver.

28:54.590 --> 28:57.320
Telling me about furnaces.
He doesn't think I know about furnaces?

28:57.493 --> 29:00.053
- I know about furnaces.
- You know how to swear at them.

29:00.229 --> 29:02.459
Yeah, and I know how to
buy them too, okay?

29:02.631 --> 29:05.498
Here's your Christmas turkey, Mr. Parker.
Ha, ha.

29:05.668 --> 29:07.636
- You folks enjoy now.
- Thank you.

29:07.803 --> 29:11.102
If I can pick up a good used car, I can
certainly pick up a good used furnace...

29:11.273 --> 29:12.968
...and you can take that to the...

29:15.411 --> 29:18.175
I'm sorry, what is this?
A serial number or something?

29:18.347 --> 29:19.814
No, no. That's the price.

29:19.982 --> 29:21.847
No, that's a mistake. It has to be.

29:22.017 --> 29:24.485
Uh, no, sir, 40 cents a pound.

29:28.757 --> 29:29.781
We can go now, dear.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.448
- Oh, but... But that's ours.
- No.

29:31.627 --> 29:33.618
That was ours.
Now that's somebody else's.

29:33.796 --> 29:36.094
- We're not paying for that.
- But you love turkey.

29:36.265 --> 29:37.493
You dream about turkey.

29:37.666 --> 29:41.158
Forty cents a pound? Hell, why not 50?

29:41.337 --> 29:42.998
Why not a whole dollar?

29:43.172 --> 29:47.506
Huh? Why not I just open up my wallet
and dump it out on the floor?

29:47.676 --> 29:49.337
How about a nice pot roast?

29:49.511 --> 29:53.572
Yeah? What's that gonna set me back?
A couple of house payments? No, thank you.

29:53.749 --> 29:55.273
Sorry, George.

29:55.451 --> 29:57.112
Cheapskate.

29:57.286 --> 29:59.186
Wait... Listen to me.

29:59.355 --> 30:01.550
We do this once a year. Once.

30:01.724 --> 30:04.249
- The drumsticks, the giblets.
- Forty.

30:04.426 --> 30:07.589
- Four, zero.
- We use it in sandwiches.

30:07.763 --> 30:11.426
We make turkey salad, chili, soup.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.363
It never stops giving.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.571
Oh, honey, it's Christmas. Let it go.

30:16.739 --> 30:17.728
I can't. No.

30:17.906 --> 30:22.240
There is no way this family is getting
suckered by this meat packer!

30:22.411 --> 30:26.040
All right, then. What are we supposed to
eat on Christmas Eve? Tell me that.

30:32.087 --> 30:35.989
- Ice fishing? Ice fishing?
- It's gonna save us a fortune.

30:36.158 --> 30:37.625
- Fish for Christmas.
- Well, why not?

30:37.793 --> 30:39.761
The folks up the street
have fish every year.

30:39.928 --> 30:43.694
- The Ragos are Italian.
- Hohman Lake is crawling with perch.

30:43.866 --> 30:47.165
Christ, they're practically gonna
leap through the hole all on their own...

30:47.336 --> 30:48.803
...and drive you home to boot. Heh.

30:48.971 --> 30:51.269
Hey, little buddy. What do you say
this year, we go out...

30:51.440 --> 30:53.567
...and we catch us
our Christmas dinner, huh?

30:54.209 --> 30:57.542
How about that for some holiday fun?

30:57.713 --> 31:00.307
This couldn't possibly end well.

31:01.950 --> 31:04.885
Every Christmas,
downtown Hohman was transformed...

31:05.053 --> 31:06.850
...into a sea of humanity.

31:07.022 --> 31:09.582
Motley hordes of blue-jowled
foundry workers...

31:09.758 --> 31:11.521
...and gray-faced refinery men...

31:11.693 --> 31:14.423
...trudging through wildly
pulsing department stores...

31:14.596 --> 31:18.293
...trailed by millions of leatherette-jacketed,
high-topped, mufflered kids...

31:18.467 --> 31:21.664
...each with a gnawing hunger
to get it all.

31:21.837 --> 31:25.933
And there we were,
in the heart of the action.

31:27.776 --> 31:31.041
We landed on the beachhead
known as the Personnel Department.

31:31.213 --> 31:33.443
And there were three bowties
with our names on them.

31:33.615 --> 31:35.446
- Now, follow me.
- We were drafted...

31:35.617 --> 31:38.609
...and consigned uniforms
without benefit of a physical.

31:38.787 --> 31:42.018
Fresh reinforcements
in the trenches of retaildom...

31:42.191 --> 31:45.160
...doing our part to grease
the wheels of commerce.

31:45.327 --> 31:48.296
It was an honor to serve.

31:48.464 --> 31:50.830
So you pull it out, like so.

31:50.999 --> 31:54.696
You take the width, you
double it, add half.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.031
- Got it?
- Um...

31:57.206 --> 32:00.334
Of course you do. Ha, ha!
You're a natural.

32:00.509 --> 32:01.874
All together now.

32:02.044 --> 32:06.242
Take the width, double it, and add half.

32:06.415 --> 32:09.111
Yes. Ha, ha. Bingo.

32:09.284 --> 32:11.809
Well, good luck. Heh.

32:17.793 --> 32:19.784
Did she just leave us?

32:20.896 --> 32:22.727
She left us.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.332
I thought we were going shopping.

32:33.509 --> 32:35.909
Just one quick stop.

32:36.078 --> 32:38.444
I went through those old newspapers
out in the garage.

32:38.614 --> 32:40.411
- Mm-hm.
- Old real estate listings.

32:40.582 --> 32:43.278
A lot of people remodel after they buy.

32:43.452 --> 32:45.943
Soup to nuts.

32:46.121 --> 32:48.316
Wanna know who the future belongs to?

32:48.490 --> 32:51.357
People with information.

32:51.527 --> 32:54.621
You just missed out. Yeah, they
hauled the old one away last week.

32:54.796 --> 32:56.764
See? You hear that? What'd I tell you?

32:56.932 --> 32:58.194
Aw, she was a beaut too.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.232
A vintage Jackman-Henderson.

33:00.602 --> 33:02.695
Yeah, they put in one of those
new central systems.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.304
Heats and cools.

33:04.473 --> 33:07.738
Don't we have a Jackman-Henderson?
He can't stand ours.

33:07.910 --> 33:11.368
- He throws his tools at it.
- It's still a reliable brand, dear.

33:11.547 --> 33:13.538
I don't see why we can't get a new one.

33:13.715 --> 33:17.378
You were so frustrated yesterday.
But he thinks he can fix anything.

33:17.553 --> 33:20.989
Last year, he thought
he could fix the fuse box.

33:21.156 --> 33:24.557
- We didn't have electricity for three days.
- That's enough, dear.

33:24.726 --> 33:27.422
We had to throw out everything
in the fridge.

33:27.596 --> 33:29.826
If you come across another,
maybe you can give a holler.

33:29.998 --> 33:32.262
- I'll keep you in mind, okay?
- Thanks.

33:32.434 --> 33:34.561
We can go now, dear.

33:36.371 --> 33:37.736
Did I say something wrong?

33:37.906 --> 33:41.205
You didn't have to tell him every detail.

33:44.446 --> 33:48.246
By the way, you didn't have to
throw everything out.

33:48.417 --> 33:51.409
The condiments kept fine.

33:51.587 --> 33:54.818
He dragged her to two more
houses that afternoon.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.958
And five the next.

34:03.498 --> 34:04.590
Please?

34:06.501 --> 34:08.594
Wait, Schwartz, double it twice, right?

34:08.770 --> 34:11.762
No, you idiot. Double it then add half.

34:13.875 --> 34:15.172
All right, next.

34:17.713 --> 34:20.045
I want to know where my tea set is.

34:20.215 --> 34:22.206
Uh, ma'am, please, be patient.

34:22.384 --> 34:25.614
You try being patient with a 10-week-old.
Mommy's here, pumpkin.

34:30.958 --> 34:33.792
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Yes.

34:34.362 --> 34:35.625
How could she just ditch us?

34:35.797 --> 34:37.059
Where the heck is she?

34:37.232 --> 34:39.928
Heh, heh. Peace on Earth.

34:48.744 --> 34:51.143
- Where are my...?
- It's the wrong package.

34:51.313 --> 34:53.338
Please, everyone, we are doing our best.

34:55.016 --> 34:57.247
My baby! Where's my baby?

35:00.322 --> 35:01.380
Oh...

35:06.828 --> 35:08.659
You wrapped her daughter?

35:08.830 --> 35:11.196
I put a pink bow on it.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.435
Follow me.

35:22.144 --> 35:23.805
Observe.

35:24.312 --> 35:26.746
Excuse me, miss.
Care to sample our new fragrance?

35:26.915 --> 35:30.112
Mm-hm. Mm.

35:31.987 --> 35:34.148
You think you can manage that?

35:46.935 --> 35:48.232
Ooh.

35:52.407 --> 35:54.307
Miss, would you care to sample
our new fragrance?

35:54.710 --> 35:57.076
- Mm.
- Oh!

36:51.099 --> 36:53.090
Definitely not.

36:53.268 --> 36:54.826
Oh...

36:56.338 --> 36:59.136
- Sample, ma'am?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

36:59.908 --> 37:00.932
One second.

37:01.109 --> 37:03.976
- Sure.
- Jammed.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.038
- Ooh!
- Oh!

37:18.794 --> 37:19.783
Aah!

37:22.197 --> 37:24.222
Oh, I'm so sorry. Here, here.

37:24.399 --> 37:25.525
Here we go.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.868
Um... Hmm.

37:39.815 --> 37:42.147
You better run!

37:51.693 --> 37:54.958
So you owe us for the mannequin...

37:55.130 --> 37:57.997
...a refund for that baby's mother,
of course.

37:58.166 --> 37:59.827
Oh, the broken stemware upstairs.

38:00.001 --> 38:03.266
You really hit the jackpot on that one.

38:03.438 --> 38:05.269
What you've earned is in this column...

38:05.440 --> 38:08.534
...what you owe is over here.

38:10.612 --> 38:12.671
Well, at least we didn't get canned.

38:12.848 --> 38:15.942
You're not kidding. Talk about a break.

38:16.117 --> 38:18.881
Because he felt sorry for us.
If you ask me, being pitied...

38:19.054 --> 38:21.579
...is a pretty good way to go through life.

38:22.524 --> 38:26.051
Hey! Parker!

38:26.228 --> 38:27.456
Hey, you'll get your money.

38:27.629 --> 38:29.756
We all got jobs,
and our first day was today.

38:30.365 --> 38:34.062
So far we're at minus $12.

38:36.137 --> 38:38.605
What are you blabbing your mouth for?

38:50.785 --> 38:54.312
Now, just stamp both copies...

38:55.824 --> 38:57.758
...file the yellow one in the tray...

38:57.926 --> 39:02.158
...and send the pink one off to shipping.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.128
You think you can handle that?

39:10.138 --> 39:12.936
Not inspiring confidence.

39:15.243 --> 39:18.041
Oh, the old man prepared for ice fishing...

39:18.213 --> 39:21.774
...the same way Attila the Hun
got ready to plunder the Balkans.

39:21.950 --> 39:25.784
There would be no prisoners
on Hohman Lake this Christmas.

39:38.333 --> 39:41.131
Six inches, not a whit more.

39:41.303 --> 39:43.635
Don't wanna tip them off
they got company, right?

39:43.805 --> 39:46.638
These walleye are crafty bastards.

39:46.808 --> 39:48.673
How come we're the only ones
out here?

39:48.843 --> 39:51.607
Well, maybe because
everybody else is a sucker...

39:51.780 --> 39:56.308
...who doesn't mind spending 40 cents
a pound for a bird that can't even fly.

39:56.484 --> 39:58.850
- But not us, right, pal?
- Sure, Dad.

40:00.288 --> 40:05.157
All right, now let's
catch us a big fish. Hm?

40:11.700 --> 40:14.225
Can we go now?

40:14.402 --> 40:16.131
We just started.

40:16.304 --> 40:19.637
- It's so cold.
- It's not cold.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.571
It's crisp.

40:21.743 --> 40:23.768
Fishing is all about patience, son.

40:23.945 --> 40:25.845
Buck up.

40:26.014 --> 40:28.073
The sun's coming out, huh?

40:28.249 --> 40:30.547
Gonna be a great day.

40:34.789 --> 40:39.419
This is why my brother Randy
still lives in Fort Lauderdale.

40:41.229 --> 40:42.321
I knew it.

40:42.497 --> 40:44.692
It's my jigging.

40:44.866 --> 40:46.265
Technique's all wrong.

40:46.434 --> 40:49.096
Gotta move the pole more. Right?

40:49.270 --> 40:50.498
Raise and drop...

40:51.072 --> 40:52.334
...raise and drop...

40:52.507 --> 40:53.701
...raise and drop.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.706
That's how you get them
to come up to the top.

40:57.946 --> 41:02.076
Tomorrow is the day, little angler.
We'll get out there bright and early, huh?

41:02.250 --> 41:03.615
Help me.

41:03.785 --> 41:05.912
Parkers. It's your dime.

41:06.588 --> 41:08.488
Why, yes.

41:08.656 --> 41:11.124
I am indeed. Let me get a pen.

41:11.292 --> 41:14.728
Sweetheart, you should be honored
your father lets you go with him.

41:14.896 --> 41:18.059
Ralphie didn't get to go fishing
till he was well past puberty.

41:18.233 --> 41:20.531
Ralphie has all the luck.

41:20.702 --> 41:22.567
Absolutely.

41:22.737 --> 41:25.399
I certainly will. Yes, and thank you.

41:25.573 --> 41:27.871
Ha-ha-ha. What'd I tell you?

41:28.043 --> 41:30.705
That was the contractor we met.
I told him to call me...

41:30.879 --> 41:34.315
...if he came across any decent furnaces.
Well, is this decent enough for you?

41:34.482 --> 41:37.383
He's got a 9-year-old Oil-O-Matic.

41:37.552 --> 41:39.850
Mint condition, 180 bucks.

41:40.021 --> 41:43.752
He'll even throw in free installation,
and he'll bring it by in the morning.

41:43.925 --> 41:45.984
Doesn't 9 years old mean used?

41:46.161 --> 41:50.257
What difference does it make?
It's an Oil-O-Matic.

41:50.432 --> 41:53.162
The kind Gene Autry sings about
on the ads.

41:53.701 --> 41:54.895
Oil-O-Matic.

41:55.070 --> 41:56.765
My, oh, my.

41:56.938 --> 42:00.066
Kiss furnace-nursing
Bye, goodbye.

42:07.749 --> 42:09.478
Excuse me.

42:13.721 --> 42:16.781
Go ahead, live it up!

42:16.958 --> 42:19.085
It's your last night on earth!

42:28.636 --> 42:31.696
Okay, Mike. Fire it up.

42:43.351 --> 42:45.979
My God.

42:46.154 --> 42:48.588
Listen to that.

42:51.926 --> 42:53.791
Please don't make me go back there.

42:53.962 --> 42:55.259
I'm begging you.

42:55.430 --> 42:58.558
Oh, honey, a good space cadet
follows orders.

42:58.733 --> 43:02.169
Play your cards right,
he might let you hold the pole today.

43:02.337 --> 43:05.397
Who cares?
He's never gonna catch a fish.

43:07.509 --> 43:09.170
What's with him?

43:09.344 --> 43:11.369
Oh, he's just excited.

43:11.546 --> 43:13.070
So have they finished?

43:13.248 --> 43:16.183
Listen. Huh? It hums.

43:16.351 --> 43:17.579
I don't hear anything.

43:17.752 --> 43:19.219
It's there. Trust me.

43:19.387 --> 43:22.720
You don't hear it
because you don't hear it.

43:24.559 --> 43:26.459
Six months later...

43:26.628 --> 43:28.892
...he'd have these two
in small claims court.

43:29.063 --> 43:32.260
But no matter.
It was time to savor the moment.

43:35.837 --> 43:37.668
You're right. I can hear it.

43:37.839 --> 43:40.672
- No, no, no. Don't patronize me.
- I can.

43:40.842 --> 43:43.902
- There's a hum.
- You're darn right there is.

43:44.078 --> 43:45.670
It's the hum of success.

43:45.847 --> 43:48.042
Heh, heh. Let's roll, Randy boy.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.149
Time to hit the hole.

44:00.028 --> 44:02.622
- What is it? What did you do?
- My tooth.

44:02.797 --> 44:04.059
Ow!

44:04.232 --> 44:06.962
- Uh-oh, you broke a filling.
- My tooth.

44:07.135 --> 44:09.296
Honey, can you go it alone today?

44:09.470 --> 44:11.529
I don't think there's a choice, I guess.

44:11.706 --> 44:13.537
I'm sorry. I'll bring you some soup later.

44:13.708 --> 44:16.074
But right now I need to get
Randy to Dr. Strassen.

44:16.244 --> 44:18.109
Dr. Strassen? No, no, no.

44:19.047 --> 44:20.275
I'm fine. I'm great.

44:20.448 --> 44:23.144
- Let's go fishing.
- All right. Let's go fishing.

44:23.318 --> 44:26.310
- Come here.
- No! No, I don't wanna go.

44:26.487 --> 44:27.647
Dad needs me.

44:27.822 --> 44:29.687
I don't wanna go with you.

44:29.857 --> 44:32.951
- Fishing is a rite of manhood. No!
- No!

44:33.127 --> 44:35.254
No, not Dr. Strassen!

44:35.430 --> 44:37.625
Randy!
- The boy wants to go fishing!

44:54.082 --> 44:57.449
This is green. We don't do green.

44:57.619 --> 45:00.247
- Wait, what's the problem?
- Yellow tray, pink ship.

45:00.421 --> 45:02.446
He never said nothing about green.

45:02.624 --> 45:05.491
You know what this means, right?
We gotta close the store.

45:05.660 --> 45:07.719
Say it ain't so, Schwartzie, not the green!

45:07.895 --> 45:10.523
All right, calm down.

45:10.698 --> 45:12.359
We'll go find out.

45:21.442 --> 45:23.637
Well, you know what they say:

45:23.811 --> 45:28.680
Those who cannot remember the past
are condemned to repeat it.

45:42.463 --> 45:43.487
Not again.

45:49.771 --> 45:50.999
You three, come with me.

45:51.172 --> 45:52.503
- Quickly.
- Huh?

45:52.674 --> 45:55.336
There's been a bit of an incident
at the North Pole.

45:55.510 --> 45:58.035
- We've lost the elves.
- But our tubes.

45:58.212 --> 46:01.045
Nuts to your tubes. Come on.

46:03.918 --> 46:05.545
Ho, ho, ho!

46:05.720 --> 46:08.211
And what do you want under the tree
this Christmas morning?

46:09.590 --> 46:11.490
Bobby wants a new swing set?

46:11.659 --> 46:14.651
Well, isn't that nice.
You know what Santa wants?

46:14.829 --> 46:18.629
A wife who doesn't hike up her skirt
every time a salesman comes calling.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.665
And neither of us
are getting what we want.

46:20.835 --> 46:22.894
Go on, get out of here. Next.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.596
Ho, ho, ho! Come on up.

46:26.374 --> 46:29.434
Now, just get them on his lap
and get them off.

46:29.610 --> 46:31.100
What happened to the real elves?

46:31.279 --> 46:33.270
They tried to start a union.

46:33.448 --> 46:34.881
Now go on, keep that line moving.

46:35.049 --> 46:38.348
Go, go, go!

46:41.622 --> 46:43.089
Extra! Extra!

46:43.257 --> 46:44.724
I don't wanna go!

46:46.027 --> 46:47.927
No! Stop, he's evil!

46:48.096 --> 46:49.563
He's a wonderful dentist.

46:49.731 --> 46:51.665
- Randy!
- No!

46:51.833 --> 46:54.233
Gunter Strassen, DDS.

46:54.402 --> 46:56.666
The most feared name in Lake County...

46:56.838 --> 47:00.501
...known to every kid in Hohman
as the Butcher of Berwyn Avenue.

47:00.675 --> 47:03.542
- Somebody help! No!
- Oh, Randy!

47:03.711 --> 47:07.044
The Butcher had a drill
he pedaled with his foot.

47:07.215 --> 47:11.777
The Butcher had little use
for such newfangled novelties as Novocain.

47:11.953 --> 47:14.114
Ah.

47:29.837 --> 47:31.498
Ah.

47:32.273 --> 47:33.297
Sweet, isn't it?

47:37.245 --> 47:39.110
Ho, ho, ho.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.272
All right. Look over there, genius.
That's the ticket.

47:43.451 --> 47:44.975
What's your story?
What do you want?

47:45.153 --> 47:46.347
Can I get a Slinky?

47:46.521 --> 47:48.318
- A Slinky?
- Mm-hm.

47:48.489 --> 47:51.947
You mean to say you waited two hours
in line to ask for a bed spring?

47:52.126 --> 47:53.650
That's it?

47:53.828 --> 47:55.796
Ha! Come on, kid, dream big.

47:55.963 --> 47:57.521
Next.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.265
There now. It wasn't so bad, was it?

48:02.437 --> 48:04.564
Okay, yeah, it was a nightmare.

48:04.739 --> 48:07.264
I don't know how you did it.

48:07.442 --> 48:10.502
Very brave. My little soldier.

48:11.012 --> 48:12.104
Oh!

48:12.280 --> 48:13.804
A little further.

48:13.981 --> 48:17.473
Ho, ho, ho.

48:17.652 --> 48:19.984
Up here. Unh.

48:21.355 --> 48:23.186
Come on, Eisenstaedt. Do your thing.

48:25.993 --> 48:28.120
All right, what can Santa
get for you, sport?

48:36.304 --> 48:39.637
Welcome to the wax museum.
Come on, spill it.

48:41.275 --> 48:44.540
It's okay, buddy.
Just tell Santa what you want.

48:49.317 --> 48:51.012
Could you bring me a tire?

48:51.185 --> 48:52.675
A tire?

48:52.854 --> 48:54.378
You mean like a bicycle tire?

48:55.256 --> 48:56.587
A car tire.

48:56.757 --> 48:58.224
A car tire?

48:58.693 --> 49:00.684
What the heck are you gonna do
with a car tire?

49:00.862 --> 49:02.386
That's just weird. Get him out of here.

49:08.402 --> 49:11.132
Hey, knock-knees, come here.

49:12.840 --> 49:13.932
What was that all about?

49:14.609 --> 49:18.511
I just think you could go
a little easier on them, that's all.

49:18.679 --> 49:20.044
Excuse me.

49:20.214 --> 49:24.082
I've been delighting children for 19 years.
Don't you step on my turf.

49:24.252 --> 49:27.050
No. We should hold Santa
to a higher standard.

49:27.221 --> 49:30.315
- I mean, you're taking the spirit out of it.
- You want dispirited?

49:30.491 --> 49:32.083
Come spend the day at my house.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.785
"Get off your lard ass
and make some money."

49:34.962 --> 49:38.056
Yeah, so she can spend it
on punchboards and cheap gin.

49:38.232 --> 49:39.358
That's dispirited.

49:39.534 --> 49:42.594
- I wanna see him now!
- Me too, fat stuff!

49:42.770 --> 49:44.499
Come on, Ralph, this guy's hopeless.

49:44.672 --> 49:45.900
Uh, let's keep it moving.

49:46.073 --> 49:47.597
Ralphie's entitled to his opinion.

49:47.775 --> 49:49.766
He has more Christmas spirit than this bum.

49:49.944 --> 49:52.435
- I'm sitting right here.
- And you shouldn't be.

49:52.613 --> 49:55.582
You're a disgrace to that uniform.
And you know what?

49:55.750 --> 49:57.877
- No more kids for you.
- What?

49:58.052 --> 50:00.987
Everyone, you can all go home.

50:01.155 --> 50:02.952
- What?
- No more Santa for you.

50:03.124 --> 50:05.115
He is not worth it.

50:05.293 --> 50:07.488
No Santa? What?

50:07.662 --> 50:08.822
Oh, you tell them, chief.

50:10.264 --> 50:11.891
Are you crazy? You see this line?

50:12.066 --> 50:13.966
It keeps going with the curve of the Earth.

50:14.135 --> 50:19.368
Now, be a good elf
and get some more kids.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.371
Did you just hit me?

50:21.542 --> 50:24.602
No, I pushed you. There's a difference.

50:24.779 --> 50:26.178
Uh, guys.

50:26.347 --> 50:29.180
You mean like this versus this?

50:30.651 --> 50:32.744
Oh-ho! Here we go, elf fight.

50:33.621 --> 50:34.747
Oh, yeah.

50:34.922 --> 50:37.117
Guy... uh, guys, guys. No, no, no.

50:37.858 --> 50:39.291
Ah, bringing out the weapons.

50:40.628 --> 50:42.255
Swing! Oh, yeah!

50:42.430 --> 50:43.522
Guys, are you crazy?

50:44.865 --> 50:47.663
- You're gonna get us fired, man. Aah!
- Oh!

50:47.835 --> 50:49.359
You see that, boys and girls?

50:49.537 --> 50:54.133
That's me and Mrs. Claus
every single night. Ha, ha!

50:54.308 --> 50:56.538
Time to slide down through the chimney...

50:56.711 --> 50:58.872
...of Mickey's Tavern and tie one on.

50:59.046 --> 51:01.708
Ho, ho, ho! I quit!

51:03.818 --> 51:05.945
- That'll learn you.
- Aah!

51:08.823 --> 51:09.881
Yoo-hoo!

51:10.057 --> 51:11.854
Hey there.

51:12.026 --> 51:15.553
Brought you a little something. Oh.

51:16.897 --> 51:19.127
Made you some soup.

51:19.300 --> 51:21.495
Ooh. Randy needed a new filling.

51:21.669 --> 51:24.502
- He's lying down for a bit.
- I don't get it.

51:24.672 --> 51:26.799
I'm jigging my keister off here.

51:26.974 --> 51:29.169
Here, have some of this, it's still warm.

51:29.343 --> 51:32.972
I'm raising, I'm dropping, I'm raising,
I'm dropping. What the heck do they want?

51:33.147 --> 51:34.671
Why don't I give it a try?

51:36.017 --> 51:38.542
- Well, your arm must be aching.
- Heh.

51:38.719 --> 51:42.211
Why not? Go to town.

51:44.425 --> 51:47.394
No, no, no. They go for the bright ones.

51:47.561 --> 51:49.859
They don't seem to go for
much of anything, actually.

51:50.031 --> 51:51.055
Excuse me?

51:51.832 --> 51:54.096
I'm just saying
maybe you need a prettier one.

51:56.637 --> 51:58.764
They don't think like that, dear.

52:04.912 --> 52:09.110
That's it. Now, just remember,
raise and drop, raise and drop.

52:09.283 --> 52:10.841
That's it.

52:11.018 --> 52:13.145
Oh, this is good.

52:17.525 --> 52:19.618
- Oh!
- Whoa!

52:19.794 --> 52:20.886
Hey, whoa! I got it!

52:21.062 --> 52:22.893
- Hang on! I got it.
- I'm trying.

52:23.064 --> 52:25.362
Whoa! That's a monster.

52:25.533 --> 52:28.161
Oh! It's prehistoric. Get the net.

52:28.335 --> 52:31.395
Get the net. Get it, get everything. Oh!

52:31.572 --> 52:34.040
- Is this the net?
- Yes.

52:34.208 --> 52:36.972
Oh, Lord!
This thing has got to be...

52:39.480 --> 52:42.005
Whoa!

52:44.285 --> 52:47.777
- It looks like your hole may be a little too...
- I know what it looks like. Hold this.

52:50.424 --> 52:51.482
Come here, you.

52:51.659 --> 52:53.627
Come here. Come on!

52:58.099 --> 52:59.691
Come on!

53:02.503 --> 53:03.595
Two days I've been out here.

53:03.771 --> 53:06.331
Now give in, you stupid, big fat...

53:22.823 --> 53:24.916
I'm fine.

53:26.861 --> 53:30.388
Give me that. I'm not finished.

53:30.564 --> 53:32.191
Sorry. Just trying to help.

53:32.366 --> 53:34.994
Heh-heh-heh. Haven't you done
enough of that already?

53:36.370 --> 53:38.361
You know, I'm not quite sure
what you mean.

53:38.539 --> 53:41.702
That means that you jinxed it!
That's what it means.

53:41.876 --> 53:44.140
Means that everything was going great
till you showed up.

53:44.311 --> 53:46.472
Really? Well, good.

53:46.647 --> 53:48.877
Because I never wanna set foot
out here again.

53:49.049 --> 53:51.210
- Good.
- Trying to get Christmas dinner...

53:51.385 --> 53:52.818
...through a little hole in the ice.

53:52.987 --> 53:55.148
This has to be the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

53:55.322 --> 53:56.516
And for what?

53:56.690 --> 53:59.488
So you wouldn't have to
part with another $3.

53:59.660 --> 54:02.220
Oh, so now it's a crime
to wanna save a little money.

54:02.396 --> 54:03.590
A little?

54:03.764 --> 54:05.959
All you do is skimp.

54:06.133 --> 54:08.693
You skimp on the furnace
and skimp on the turkey...

54:08.869 --> 54:10.461
...and skimp on the car.

54:10.638 --> 54:13.539
You wouldn't even help out
your own son when he needed it.

54:13.707 --> 54:17.336
You talking about Ralph?
You ever hear of setting an example?

54:17.511 --> 54:19.376
Oh, yes, job well done there.

54:19.547 --> 54:20.980
I was being a good parent.

54:21.148 --> 54:23.480
You were being a cheap son of a bit...!

54:23.651 --> 54:27.382
My mother had not uttered
an obscenity in 30 years.

54:27.555 --> 54:31.218
Ever since she was a teenager,
and lost her job at Kreski's Market...

54:31.392 --> 54:34.259
...for telling a hostile customer
to "go to heck."

54:34.428 --> 54:36.259
Jig all you want.

54:36.430 --> 54:39.695
- I'm going caroling.
- Fine with me.

54:39.867 --> 54:41.767
And thanks for the delicious snack!

54:41.936 --> 54:43.335
Oh!

54:50.744 --> 54:54.578
Our own employment picture
grew dimmer that evening...

54:54.748 --> 54:58.775
...when I lost the first and only job
I'd ever had.

55:05.192 --> 55:08.787
Deck the halls
With boughs of holly.

55:08.963 --> 55:12.399
Fa la la la la La la la la.

55:12.566 --> 55:16.093
By now, I knew I'd probably
never experience a Christmas...

55:16.270 --> 55:17.669
...quite like this one.

55:17.838 --> 55:19.738
And I wasn't alone.

55:20.474 --> 55:22.738
My mother realized that in a sense,
she too...

55:22.910 --> 55:25.276
...was about to be relieved of a job.

55:25.446 --> 55:29.041
That one day soon,
it would be time to let go of a son.

55:29.216 --> 55:31.650
Ancient yuletide carol.

55:31.819 --> 55:38.315
Fa la la la la La la la la

55:39.026 --> 55:41.927
I would be on my own, out in the world.

55:42.096 --> 55:44.257
Into it, I would bring all
that I had learned...

55:44.431 --> 55:48.959
...from her and the old man,
forging my own tentative path.

55:54.275 --> 55:58.234
And coming to terms with the fact
that it can be a lonely place...

55:58.412 --> 56:01.677
...even during the most joyful of seasons.

56:18.165 --> 56:20.292
Mom?

56:20.467 --> 56:22.765
- Mom?
- Downstairs.

56:22.937 --> 56:25.303
I was trying to find
our Christmas stockings.

56:25.472 --> 56:27.463
So many little things this time of year.

56:27.641 --> 56:29.472
- Here, I could help you.
- Oh, it's okay.

56:29.643 --> 56:33.101
I have to get used to doing this
without you boys sooner or later, right?

56:33.280 --> 56:35.180
- Mom...
- It's fine.

56:35.349 --> 56:37.044
Go on. Shoo.

56:39.019 --> 56:40.384
Hey, that's it.

56:40.554 --> 56:42.522
An Oil-O-Matic.

56:42.690 --> 56:46.126
My, oh, my. Ha, ha.

56:46.293 --> 56:47.555
Hey, where is Dad?

56:47.728 --> 56:49.787
Oh, he's still out on the lake.

56:49.964 --> 56:53.661
Hopefully shivering
and unable to feel his toes.

56:53.834 --> 56:56.860
- I think I'm gonna go out there.
- Well, do not bring him a blanket.

56:57.037 --> 56:59.335
Apparently he doesn't
appreciate anything nice...

56:59.506 --> 57:00.803
...people try to do for him.

57:04.712 --> 57:06.339
Ralphie?

57:06.513 --> 57:08.140
That you?

57:10.217 --> 57:12.617
Hey, Dad. How you doing?

57:12.786 --> 57:15.311
Heh. Hey.

57:15.489 --> 57:18.617
- Come on over, pull up a chair.
- Heh.

57:18.792 --> 57:22.592
I thought I'd take a ride
and stretch my legs.

57:22.763 --> 57:25.630
Seems like a pretty nice night.

57:25.799 --> 57:27.994
It's 10 degrees out.

57:30.004 --> 57:31.995
- Yeah, okay.
- Ha, ha.

57:32.172 --> 57:36.438
Uh, I actually
kind of wanted to talk.

57:37.544 --> 57:40.513
Well, sure, let's talk.

57:40.681 --> 57:41.909
How's it going at work?

57:45.052 --> 57:48.488
God, it seems like only yesterday, I was
watching your mother change your diapers.

57:48.655 --> 57:51.749
And here I am asking you,
"How's it going at work?"

57:53.594 --> 57:55.755
uh, that's sort of what I wanted to, uh...

57:55.929 --> 57:57.419
Look at you, huh?

57:57.598 --> 58:01.557
Getting that job downtown, not giving in.

58:02.569 --> 58:05.834
You and me, kid, we are two of a kind.

58:06.006 --> 58:08.770
A couple of stubborn sons of bitches,
plain and simple.

58:10.711 --> 58:14.078
We're finishers. We hang tough.

58:15.382 --> 58:20.217
MacArthur. He didn't pull out of Bataan
till they held a gun to his head.

58:20.821 --> 58:23.221
Dugout Doug, they called him.

58:24.124 --> 58:26.319
You know what they say:

58:26.493 --> 58:29.929
Sometimes it's the last key in the bunch...

58:30.097 --> 58:32.497
...that opens the lock.

58:36.570 --> 58:38.697
To tell you the truth...

58:38.872 --> 58:41.739
...I'm not even sure
if I know what that one means.

58:44.311 --> 58:46.370
I do.

58:46.547 --> 58:48.242
I know just what that means.

58:49.783 --> 58:50.807
Well, good.

58:51.518 --> 58:52.849
That makes one of us.

58:53.020 --> 58:56.581
Here, hold this.
I have got to get some soup.

58:56.757 --> 59:00.625
We sat there shivering
and telling tall tales to each other.

59:00.794 --> 59:03.524
After I left,
he stayed three more hours...

59:03.697 --> 59:05.187
...and never caught a thing.

59:05.365 --> 59:08.528
I didn't find that out
until many years later, of course...

59:08.702 --> 59:12.638
...and it was a secret
that I'm glad was kept.

59:59.686 --> 01:00:01.916
Sir, may I have a word with you?

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.088
Uh... Sir, please, wait!

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.023
Don't come any closer.

01:00:08.195 --> 01:00:09.321
I want another chance.

01:00:09.496 --> 01:00:11.691
I distinctly remember
telling you and your friends...

01:00:11.865 --> 01:00:13.924
...that you would be physically removed...

01:00:14.101 --> 01:00:16.069
...if you ever entered
this establishment again.

01:00:16.236 --> 01:00:18.830
I hardly knew those guys.
It is just me now.

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:21.236
I'll do whatever you want, no slip-ups.

01:00:21.408 --> 01:00:25.401
Please. It's Christmas.

01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:27.171
- Security!
- No!

01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:29.110
I am not going anywhere.

01:00:29.283 --> 01:00:33.185
I'm a stubborn son of a bitch,
just like he is.

01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:35.014
Like who?

01:00:36.089 --> 01:00:39.490
Never mind. um...

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.824
Sir, if you give me one more shot...

01:00:43.997 --> 01:00:45.362
...you will not regret it.

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:49.058
Very well.

01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:52.399
Oh, I wish I wasn't such a softie.

01:00:53.407 --> 01:00:57.241
- Thank you.
- You don't mind working outside, do you?

01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:00.107
No. No, no, anywhere. Not at all.

01:01:54.234 --> 01:01:57.692
Ding, ding, ding.

01:01:58.405 --> 01:02:01.374
Ding, ding.

01:02:02.442 --> 01:02:05.002
Not her. Anyone but her.

01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:08.375
If she sees me dressed like this,
I might as well move to the North Pole.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:13.481
I'll die alone on some ice floe,
the world's only virgin reindeer.

01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:15.816
Please. No.

01:02:15.989 --> 01:02:19.288
One glimpse of me and I'll go right from
"she doesn't know I'm alive"...

01:02:19.459 --> 01:02:21.654
...to "stay away from me, you."

01:02:21.828 --> 01:02:24.854
Oh, you again, eh?

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:26.556
Get out of here!

01:02:26.733 --> 01:02:28.200
Whoa!

01:02:28.368 --> 01:02:30.996
You lousy cotton-tailed klutz.

01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:33.036
I spent all day getting that.

01:02:33.206 --> 01:02:34.639
Sorry. I'll pick it up.

01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:37.402
You bet your butt you will,
every dime.

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.373
Yes, sir.

01:02:41.748 --> 01:02:43.045
- I'll get it.
- Hey!

01:02:43.216 --> 01:02:44.706
Hey, get back here.

01:02:48.555 --> 01:02:49.579
Sir?

01:02:49.756 --> 01:02:52.156
Sir, uh, that 5, um, it's not yours.

01:02:52.326 --> 01:02:53.987
Guy on the corner's collecting money.

01:02:54.161 --> 01:02:57.096
Oh, yeah? Well, you tell him
I said job well done.

01:02:57.264 --> 01:02:59.732
- Come on, sir. It's for charity.
- Take a hike, Bambi.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.996
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Actually, you do.

01:03:09.009 --> 01:03:11.068
Well, that would make me
a liar then, wouldn't it?

01:03:15.048 --> 01:03:16.845
Yes?

01:03:33.633 --> 01:03:36.295
All those faces floating over me...

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.200
...and the only one I could see was hers.

01:03:39.373 --> 01:03:42.103
It was over. Why bother getting up?

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:44.709
Why bother going back home...

01:03:44.878 --> 01:03:48.370
...or back to school or back to anything?

01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:55.185
Why bother having dreams at all?

01:04:06.933 --> 01:04:08.924
Eighty-four dollars and twelve cents.

01:04:09.102 --> 01:04:10.501
That's it.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:15.004
Oh, that's so close.
But you're still going to prison, pal.

01:04:15.175 --> 01:04:19.407
Hey, uh, we can send you some
girly magazines to bribe the screws with.

01:04:19.579 --> 01:04:22.139
I'm not going to jail.

01:04:22.315 --> 01:04:24.306
Did you ever get that 5 bucks
your sister owes you?

01:04:24.484 --> 01:04:28.750
Um, no, she used it
to buy a winter coat for my grandma.

01:04:28.922 --> 01:04:30.514
Well, that was stupid.

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.284
Yeah? You want my grandma to freeze?

01:04:34.628 --> 01:04:36.255
Did you just push me?

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.092
Um, no. This is a push, Nancy Drew.

01:04:39.266 --> 01:04:41.700
- Do it again, I double-dog dare you.
- Wait, I got it!

01:04:41.868 --> 01:04:43.563
I'll put some of my things in hock.

01:04:43.737 --> 01:04:46.103
Look around. I got all kinds
of valuable stuff.

01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:48.332
Yeah, because what pawnshop
wouldn't want...

01:04:48.508 --> 01:04:51.170
...an old Augie Galan mitt
or an Orphan Annie decoder?

01:04:51.344 --> 01:04:53.039
I just need a dollar.

01:04:53.213 --> 01:04:55.113
One lousy dollar.

01:04:55.282 --> 01:04:58.445
We're tapped out, pal. All of us.
We've been picked clean.

01:04:58.618 --> 01:05:02.315
We've lifted every sofa cushion,
raided every sock drawer we could find.

01:05:02.489 --> 01:05:06.084
And every cent we got
is right there on that bed.

01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:13.626
What's in the pocket, Schwartz?

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.098
Nothing.

01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:17.497
Schwartzie.

01:05:17.671 --> 01:05:19.104
You can't have my lucky buck.

01:05:19.272 --> 01:05:21.968
- Your what?
- My lucky buck.

01:05:22.142 --> 01:05:24.303
I got it from Grandpa Maury.

01:05:24.478 --> 01:05:27.072
And I still remember the look on his face
when he gave it to me.

01:05:27.247 --> 01:05:30.011
Who cares? Your best friend
is gonna do time.

01:05:30.183 --> 01:05:33.448
You don't understand.
This buck turned everything around for me.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.679
That first time that I
held it in my hand...

01:05:35.856 --> 01:05:38.654
...I knew that I'd always come out on top.

01:05:38.825 --> 01:05:41.157
If I lose it...

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:42.886
...my whole world would fall apart.

01:05:44.264 --> 01:05:46.562
You're right. Forget it.

01:05:46.733 --> 01:05:48.360
It's not worth it.

01:05:48.535 --> 01:05:50.264
Not if it means that much to him.

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.968
Wait a minute.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.539
I've never seen it before.

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:58.701
Uh, when exactly did you get it?

01:05:59.846 --> 01:06:01.245
The second night of Hanukkah.

01:06:01.414 --> 01:06:02.676
What year?

01:06:04.484 --> 01:06:07.749
Last Tuesday. I got this tie too.

01:06:11.024 --> 01:06:12.491
Guys, stop. Guys.

01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:14.752
- Guys, guys, that tickles.
- Let go, Schwartz!

01:06:14.928 --> 01:06:16.919
No, no! Not my lucky buck!

01:06:17.097 --> 01:06:19.065
Say uncle! Say uncle!

01:06:19.232 --> 01:06:22.065
Aah, aah.

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:26.001
- Eighty-five! Uncle!

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.001
Eighty-five indeed.

01:06:29.175 --> 01:06:31.905
I had pulled it off, against all odds.

01:06:32.078 --> 01:06:34.376
Stop the presses, sound the trumpets.

01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:36.573
Victory was mine.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.809
This time, I had beaten the furnace.

01:06:38.985 --> 01:06:41.249
I changed the tire in four minutes flat.

01:06:41.421 --> 01:06:43.821
I bowled the 271.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.823
That's another way we were the same,
the old man and I.

01:06:46.993 --> 01:06:48.119
I knew how it felt...

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:52.026
...to sample the sweet nectar of triumph.

01:06:52.899 --> 01:06:54.491
Lesson learned, all right.

01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:57.501
Determination was the key.

01:06:57.671 --> 01:07:00.902
No matter what,
stay the course, never falter.

01:07:01.074 --> 01:07:05.010
Always keep your eyes on the prize.

01:07:05.178 --> 01:07:06.805
Really coming down, isn't it?

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.505
Looks like a white Christmas tomorrow.

01:07:09.683 --> 01:07:11.947
Well, that's the way it should be, right?

01:07:12.452 --> 01:07:14.716
Yes, sir, it is.

01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:15.912
Merry Christmas.

01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:24.525
Being teenagers meant
that we were often capable...

01:07:24.698 --> 01:07:27.724
...of perpetrating
reckless irrational acts.

01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:29.732
Such deeds tended to involve items...

01:07:29.903 --> 01:07:33.532
...like raw eggs or rolls of toilet paper.

01:07:36.643 --> 01:07:39.703
There were usually simple
and understandable explanations...

01:07:39.879 --> 01:07:41.972
...for such behavior.

01:07:42.148 --> 01:07:45.174
We were either young
or careless or stupid.

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.877
Or in my case, all three.

01:07:48.054 --> 01:07:51.785
And then there were times,
every once in a blue moon...

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:54.483
...when we did things
we couldn't explain at all.

01:07:54.661 --> 01:07:57.562
Ha-ha-ha! That's it.

01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:25.685
Sorry. Long day.

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:27.189
He's here.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.885
Oh, good. Let's eat.

01:08:30.063 --> 01:08:32.554
Eat what? What are we having?

01:08:34.573 --> 01:08:35.596
Right.

01:08:37.142 --> 01:08:39.406
Well, as you know, I... I thought...

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:43.810
...we would try something a little
different for Christmas dinner this year.

01:08:43.982 --> 01:08:46.576
Yeah, that was a laugh riot.

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:49.481
Well, I was trying to be frugal.

01:08:50.287 --> 01:08:54.520
But as it turns out,
what I was really being was...

01:08:54.693 --> 01:08:56.388
Okay, everyone...

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.428
...look at the dinner
your father caught just for us.

01:09:00.999 --> 01:09:02.488
Shazam.

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:05.363
My brother never heard
what really happened...

01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:07.698
- ...and hasn't to this day.
- You're amazing.

01:09:07.872 --> 01:09:11.774
Some acts of glaring deceit
are best kept hidden away forever.

01:09:14.045 --> 01:09:15.671
Who's calling on Christmas Eve?

01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:17.872
These bill collectors
will not leave you alone.

01:09:19.651 --> 01:09:21.084
I think that's for me.

01:09:25.256 --> 01:09:27.451
Eat your vegetable.

01:09:29.761 --> 01:09:32.194
Parker residence. Ralph speaking.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:46.001
There he is. My test driver.

01:09:46.176 --> 01:09:49.544
I was starting to think
you'd forgotten about me.

01:09:49.714 --> 01:09:51.113
I know.

01:09:51.282 --> 01:09:53.011
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:09:53.184 --> 01:09:55.243
You don't have it, do you?

01:09:57.455 --> 01:10:00.447
- No, sir. Not all of it.
- I should've known.

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.093
But I tried, I really did.

01:10:03.261 --> 01:10:06.594
And we all got jobs, and I earned
most of the money, but...

01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:10.728
Those people needed the tire...

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:14.338
...and I tried to get them to order the family
special, but they all wanted à la carte.

01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:17.498
- You know how that adds up...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:20.702
You are one weird kid.

01:10:22.414 --> 01:10:24.382
I've heard that, sir.

01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:29.443
Ninety, 91, 92...

01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:33.648
...93, 94.

01:10:33.825 --> 01:10:35.793
Thirty-nine dollars and ninety-four cents.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.292
- Is that it?
- I'll have the rest next month.

01:10:38.463 --> 01:10:41.193
And if not, you can break my legs.
Or maybe one leg.

01:10:41.366 --> 01:10:42.390
Skip it. You're done.

01:10:43.968 --> 01:10:46.528
- I am?
- Yeah, merry "ho, ho," and all that.

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:48.104
You know? Spirit of the season.

01:10:48.273 --> 01:10:50.935
- Thank you.
- I just sold that Merc, anyway.

01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:53.907
Made out like a bandit.
The sucker never knew what hit him.

01:10:56.915 --> 01:10:59.884
The thing is, you never let up.

01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:02.451
And what did I tell you
about determination, huh?

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.053
It gets things done.

01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:06.383
And it'll pay off big
for you one day, you'll see.

01:11:06.558 --> 01:11:07.923
Now go on home, son.

01:11:08.493 --> 01:11:10.051
And enjoy your family tomorrow.

01:11:10.228 --> 01:11:12.788
Thank you, Mr. Catenhauser.
And merry Christmas.

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:15.057
Merry Christmas.

01:11:16.835 --> 01:11:18.302
Made out like a bandit!

01:11:22.307 --> 01:11:24.104
My car was gone.

01:11:24.275 --> 01:11:26.766
I had nothing in my pocket but a hole.

01:11:26.945 --> 01:11:31.644
And somehow, as I walked home
on that bone-chilling silent night...

01:11:31.816 --> 01:11:34.580
...all was right with the world.

01:11:52.403 --> 01:11:53.427
Yes!

01:11:53.605 --> 01:11:55.129
Yes. A Martian police ship...

01:11:55.306 --> 01:11:58.104
...form the Buck Rogers
Interplanetary Space Fleet!

01:11:58.276 --> 01:11:59.766
Thank you, thank you!

01:11:59.944 --> 01:12:01.639
I told you he'd like it.

01:12:01.813 --> 01:12:03.838
And you wanted to get him socks.

01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:06.779
Oh, boys, boys. Let's wait.
Let's do this right.

01:12:06.951 --> 01:12:09.215
- Who wants to play Santa?
- Me! Me! I do! I do!

01:12:09.387 --> 01:12:11.412
No. You did it last time
and you stank at it.

01:12:11.589 --> 01:12:12.920
- Did not!
- Did too.

01:12:13.091 --> 01:12:14.649
- Did not!
- Okay, okay, boys. Stop.

01:12:14.826 --> 01:12:16.316
I'll play Santa. Shoo!

01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:19.190
Go. Okay. Who goes first?

01:12:19.697 --> 01:12:23.599
- Come on, Mom. Uh... Oh.

01:12:23.768 --> 01:12:26.669
- Here, honey, this is for you.
- Me? Oh.

01:12:35.013 --> 01:12:37.174
Oh-ho!

01:12:38.683 --> 01:12:39.672
Oh.

01:12:39.851 --> 01:12:41.648
I thought we could go back out.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.912
You know what they say:

01:12:43.087 --> 01:12:45.487
Lightning always strikes twice
in the same place.

01:12:45.657 --> 01:12:47.090
They say that, do they?

01:12:49.093 --> 01:12:52.221
- Thank you. Ha, ha.
- Let's see. Who's next? Oh.

01:12:56.267 --> 01:13:00.704
Ralph, this is for you from Aunt Clara.

01:13:00.872 --> 01:13:02.305
Oh, no.

01:13:02.473 --> 01:13:04.304
"Oh, no" was right.

01:13:04.475 --> 01:13:08.036
It was time for the annual
Aunt Clara humiliation fest.

01:13:08.213 --> 01:13:11.546
Lord knows what sort
of degrading polyester nightmare...

01:13:11.716 --> 01:13:13.274
...was in store for me this year.

01:13:13.451 --> 01:13:16.716
Well, go on, open it.
She always gets you the nicest things.

01:13:19.724 --> 01:13:22.659
- It's not funny, Randy.
- Yes, it is.

01:13:25.797 --> 01:13:27.230
Oh, it's a sailor suit.

01:13:27.398 --> 01:13:29.229
Is that just the cutest thing?

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.765
Good Lord.

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:34.438
Sweet Jesus.

01:13:34.606 --> 01:13:35.937
Forget it, Mom.

01:13:36.107 --> 01:13:38.132
I am not kidding,
I will join the foreign legion.

01:13:38.309 --> 01:13:40.971
He's almost 16. Is she that deranged?

01:13:42.013 --> 01:13:43.674
Oh, wait a minute.

01:13:43.848 --> 01:13:45.281
This isn't for Ralphie.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:49.477
Randy, she sent this to you.

01:13:54.959 --> 01:13:56.586
No! No! No!

01:13:56.761 --> 01:13:58.285
- Sailor boy!
- No! No.

01:13:58.463 --> 01:13:59.987
No. No!

01:14:00.164 --> 01:14:02.098
Boys. Boys.

01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:05.395
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're gonna look so good.

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.401
No.

01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:13.940
That is too adorable for words.

01:14:14.112 --> 01:14:15.739
I can think of a few.

01:14:17.548 --> 01:14:20.210
- Where's the camera, honey?
- No. No!

01:14:20.385 --> 01:14:23.320
- Wait'II these get around school.
- Ralphie, no!

01:14:23.488 --> 01:14:25.149
Big smile.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.232
Ah, another one come and gone, huh?
Not too shabby.

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:47.605
Nope. You guys get
everything you wanted?

01:14:48.479 --> 01:14:50.037
I'd say so.

01:14:50.214 --> 01:14:51.613
Pretty good haul, huh?

01:14:53.384 --> 01:14:56.285
Hey, I think I just saw a rat
in the kitchen.

01:14:56.955 --> 01:15:00.356
Okay, I'll call the exterminator.

01:15:00.525 --> 01:15:01.753
Are you insane?

01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:04.394
Do you know what they charge
on a holiday?

01:15:23.448 --> 01:15:26.281
I smell a rat, all right.

01:15:46.337 --> 01:15:48.771
Whoa.

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.067
- This is a Martian police ship.
- Oh.

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:54.302
Which holds an entire battalion
of tiger...

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.281
My God. It's risen from the grave.

01:16:02.453 --> 01:16:04.387
Isn't it beautiful?

01:16:05.623 --> 01:16:06.988
It's beautiful.

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:14.462
This is the greatest Christmas in history.

01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:20.527
You see what Santa gave me?

01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:23.105
Yeah, I'd like to thank him personally.

01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.969
Look at her face.

01:16:25.143 --> 01:16:26.610
Somebody take a photo.

01:16:26.778 --> 01:16:29.747
Yeah, you know what, that's a good idea.

01:16:29.914 --> 01:16:33.042
Why don't we all take a picture, huh?

01:16:33.217 --> 01:16:35.276
Yeah. Everybody,
the three of you by the tree.

01:16:35.453 --> 01:16:37.114
- Uh, Dad...
- Honey, I'm not dressed.

01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:39.051
You look fine. One for the scrapbook.

01:16:40.124 --> 01:16:43.150
Line up. Mom, you in the middle.
Come on, get in there.

01:16:43.327 --> 01:16:46.626
That's it. Now, Ralphie,
move in a little bit.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.198
A little more.

01:16:53.304 --> 01:16:54.601
A little more.

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:13.514
Yes!

01:17:17.962 --> 01:17:21.557
Thank you! Thank you!

01:17:24.202 --> 01:17:26.898
That's the last we'll be seeing
of him for a while.

01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:30.234
But, hey, you'll always
have me to bark at.

01:17:30.408 --> 01:17:32.899
No fair, Ralphie got a car.

01:17:33.077 --> 01:17:34.567
I want a real rocket ship.

01:17:34.745 --> 01:17:36.303
Well, learn from this, Randy.

01:17:36.481 --> 01:17:40.679
If you're as determined as Ralphie,
maybe one day you'll get one.

01:17:40.852 --> 01:17:42.820
I guess that means no.

01:17:42.987 --> 01:17:44.716
- That's right.
- Polish your leather...

01:17:44.889 --> 01:17:47.357
...and polish your interior! Oh, my God!

01:17:47.525 --> 01:17:50.858
This is the best Christmas ever!

01:18:05.977 --> 01:18:09.413
The odometer read 132,000 miles.

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.310
Oil burned and valves leaked at will.

01:18:12.483 --> 01:18:15.577
There were more rattles
than an lrish nursery.

01:18:15.753 --> 01:18:19.211
It was the best car I ever owned.

01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:22.826
In 43 days, I would turn
16 and be liberated.

01:18:22.994 --> 01:18:26.225
No longer bound by gravity,
but free, fluid...

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:28.592
...at one with the wind and the sun.

01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:31.360
Preceding that joyous emancipation...

01:18:31.536 --> 01:18:35.597
...I would fail the
driver's test four times.

01:18:38.643 --> 01:18:39.974
Uh...

01:18:48.886 --> 01:18:50.046
I'll hold it.

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:52.121
You go set the brake.

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:53.314
Go!

01:19:04.068 --> 01:19:06.502
You should really leave the car in gear
when it's parked.

01:19:06.671 --> 01:19:08.104
My dad says that.

01:19:09.707 --> 01:19:11.538
Good advice.

01:19:14.979 --> 01:19:18.005
Well, are you gonna say anything?

01:19:18.182 --> 01:19:22.585
So you just out looking for runaway cars?
Ha, ha.

01:19:22.753 --> 01:19:25.244
Actually, I came to see you.

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:27.547
I got your address from the Flicks.

01:19:27.725 --> 01:19:29.920
His mom and my mom volunteer
at the hospital.

01:19:31.529 --> 01:19:34.362
Do you remember the other day,
in front of Higbee's?

01:19:34.532 --> 01:19:36.056
Antlers, sleigh bells?

01:19:36.767 --> 01:19:38.667
Uh, yeah.

01:19:39.704 --> 01:19:42.696
- Look, I can explain.
- You don't have to.

01:19:42.873 --> 01:19:44.704
I saw what you did.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.639
It takes a lot of guts
to stand up to a jark like that.

01:19:47.812 --> 01:19:50.110
You don't see that very often.

01:19:51.849 --> 01:19:55.649
I guess I just wanted you to know that.

01:19:58.489 --> 01:19:59.615
Here.

01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:02.156
We're big on fruitcake
at the Gootrad house.

01:20:02.326 --> 01:20:03.816
Eat them, use them as paperweight.

01:20:03.995 --> 01:20:06.691
Ha, ha. Up to you.

01:20:06.864 --> 01:20:08.422
Thanks.

01:20:11.902 --> 01:20:13.199
Should you be...?

01:20:14.305 --> 01:20:16.637
I mean, are you and, um...?

01:20:18.242 --> 01:20:19.266
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You know.

01:20:19.443 --> 01:20:21.707
- Todd?
- Yeah.

01:20:21.879 --> 01:20:24.973
We talked the other day and sort of decided
to go our separate ways.

01:20:25.983 --> 01:20:28.884
Well, I decided.

01:20:29.053 --> 01:20:32.216
Oh. I didn't know that.

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.381
How could you?
We've been out of school.

01:20:34.558 --> 01:20:37.049
And I've just been puttering
around the kitchen all week.

01:20:37.228 --> 01:20:39.253
- Baking paperweights.
- Thousands of them.

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:41.830
You have no idea how good
it feels to be outdoors.

01:20:41.999 --> 01:20:44.160
Well, I'm glad.

01:20:45.303 --> 01:20:47.328
I mean, I'm...
I'm glad that you picked here...

01:20:47.505 --> 01:20:48.529
...to be outdoors at.

01:20:51.642 --> 01:20:54.167
Oh. Oh, boy, that came out stupid.

01:20:55.913 --> 01:20:58.143
No.

01:20:58.316 --> 01:21:00.716
It came out great.

01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:08.989
- So is this your car?
- Yeah.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.491
'39 Mercury Eight.

01:21:10.661 --> 01:21:12.720
Wow, what a wonderful Christmas present.

01:21:21.605 --> 01:21:24.403
Please? Please?

01:21:24.575 --> 01:21:26.338
Once.

01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:28.705
Once around the block.

01:21:40.524 --> 01:21:41.889
When I was 9...

01:21:42.059 --> 01:21:44.721
...I pulled the wrapping
off the present of my dreams...

01:21:44.895 --> 01:21:49.161
...and knew, right then and there,
no Christmas would ever be the same.

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:51.062
And none were.

01:21:51.235 --> 01:21:52.566
Until today.
