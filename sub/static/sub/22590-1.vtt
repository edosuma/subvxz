<i>NARRATOR". Every day in Gotham City
brings new surprises...</i>

00:14.766 --> 00:17.268
<i>...but this day is going to top them all.</i>

00:17.435 --> 00:20.772
<i>Although it begins none too differently,
just wait.</i>

00:32.616 --> 00:35.370
Well, we've managed
to clip Catwoman's claws once again.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.956
She won't be troubling Gotham City
for a long while.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.791
She sure led us a chase, Batman.

00:39.958 --> 00:43.127
If I never hear another one of those meows,
it'll be too soon.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.922
I'm afraid your eardrums
aren't going to get much rest...

00:46.089 --> 00:48.091
...or had you forgotten that we invited...

00:48.258 --> 00:51.761
...Chief O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon
to the opera tonight?

00:52.637 --> 00:54.138
That's right.

00:54.305 --> 00:57.475
Batman, maybe I should stay home tonight.
Homework, you know?

00:57.642 --> 01:02.313
I think you should acquire a taste for opera,
Robin, as one does for poetry and olives.

01:02.480 --> 01:07.193
Besides, Commissioner Gordon is bringing
his daughter, Barbara, along as my date.

01:07.527 --> 01:09.320
So?

01:09.487 --> 01:11.239
So tonight is Dick Grayson's night...

01:11.406 --> 01:14.701
...for musical appreciation
and the social amenities.

01:19.914 --> 01:24.377
<i>NARRATOR". While at the Gotham City Library,
where one of the newer librarians...</i>

01:24.544 --> 01:28.006
...is <i>leaving for her night
of culture and social</i> graces...

01:28.172 --> 01:30.842
- Good night, Drusilla. See you in the morning.
-Good night, Barbara.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.804
Gotham City Public Library.

01:34.971 --> 01:36.931
Oh, Commissioner Gordon, how are you?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.558
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.476
Yes, she's right here. Just a moment.

01:40.643 --> 01:43.187
-It's your father, Barbara.
-Hi, Daddy.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.607
You haven't forgotten about the opera,
have you?

01:45.940 --> 01:49.736
How could I? It's The Marriage of Figaro,
my very favorite opera.

01:49.902 --> 01:54.407
Besides, um, I'm looking forward to seeing
our host, millionaire Bruce Wayne.

01:54.574 --> 01:57.035
Well, he's gonna get
quite a surprise tonight.

01:57.201 --> 02:00.330
He hasn't seen you since you went away
to college four years ago.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.416
And you're twice as pretty now
as you were then.

02:03.958 --> 02:07.045
Ha, ha. Another one of your unbiased opinions,
Daddy.

02:07.378 --> 02:12.050
Any good police commissioner
must always remain unbiased, Barbara. Ha, ha.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.553
Seven, your apartment. Bruce Wayne
is meeting us there to pick you up.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.889
<i>- I'll be ready.
- Bye.</i>

02:18.056 --> 02:19.557
Bye.

02:21.142 --> 02:25.563
<i>NARRATOR". Later, Barbara Gordon enters
the lobby of her midtown apartment house...</i>

02:25.730 --> 02:28.232
<i>...unaware of imminent danger.</i>

02:31.611 --> 02:34.072
Welcome to the cage, my wild dove.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.323
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

02:35.698 --> 02:39.410
- Penguin.
-What a tasty little squab she is too.

02:39.577 --> 02:44.499
Trust Penguin to have a surefire recipe
for pigeon pie. Hwah, hwah, hwah.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.675
Barbara.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.012
That's odd, Chief O'Hara.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.183
Maybe she just stepped out for a minute,
commissioner.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.226
But she knew we'd be here at 7.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.855
And that afternoon paper
was delivered hours ago.

04:31.022 --> 04:33.691
Why didn't she take it inside?

04:36.861 --> 04:39.280
Uh... Ha, ha.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.574
Our secret.

04:57.507 --> 05:00.468
Looks as if she hasn't even
been home from work.

05:01.636 --> 05:03.387
I don't understand it.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.057
Where can she be?

05:06.224 --> 05:10.353
<i>NARRATOR". You'd be very surprised
to find out, commissioner...</i>

05:10.520 --> 05:14.106
...for <i>your daughter
is only 20 feet away from you...</i>

05:14.273 --> 05:16.567
<i>...in the very next apartment.</i>

05:23.574 --> 05:27.245
You'll have to admit,
this is a stroke of genius, my love.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.290
Hiding you out in this vacant apartment
right next to your very own.

05:31.457 --> 05:35.920
It's the last place in Gotham City
anybody would think of looking for you.

05:38.965 --> 05:40.007
What's going on there?

05:41.259 --> 05:44.595
Gordon and O'Hara
just went into the apartment, Pengy.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.849
And here comes Bruce Wayne
and that witless ward of his.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.687
I think it's time
for my surprise telephone call.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.737
Hello, commissioner, Chief O'Hara.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.614
- Where's Barbara?
-She's not here.

06:04.282 --> 06:07.743
- Not here?
-And I'm worried. It's not like her at all.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.455
That's probably her calling you right now.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.584
I hope you're right, Chief O'Hara.

06:15.251 --> 06:17.920
- Hello?
-Hello, commissioner.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.922
Police Commissioner Gordon?

06:20.089 --> 06:22.091
Guess who this is. Hwah, hwah, hwah!

06:22.466 --> 06:24.218
Penguin. It's Penguin.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.806
<i>Yes, I just called to say hello,
commissioner.</i>

06:28.973 --> 06:32.310
By the way, you didn't happen
to be missing anything lately, did you?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.437
Missing? Miss--

06:34.604 --> 06:35.813
Barbara.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.190
You've got Barbara, you feathered fiend.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.859
Hush, hush, sir.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.987
Is that any way to speak
to your daughter's guardian?

06:43.154 --> 06:45.072
Penguin, if you harm her...

06:45.239 --> 06:48.075
...if you so much as
touch one hair on her head...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.744
...I'll-- I'll--

06:49.911 --> 06:51.704
- You'll do what?
-I'll--

06:51.871 --> 06:54.665
Let me talk to him, commissioner.
This is Bruce Wayne.

06:54.832 --> 06:57.001
Oh, the millionaire joyboy.

06:57.168 --> 06:58.461
What can I do for you?

06:58.628 --> 07:02.673
Penguin, I'll pay whatever price you ask,
as long as you do not harm Barbara Gordon.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.508
Harm her? Fa!

07:04.675 --> 07:07.345
I'm gonna make her the happiest girl
in Gotham City.

07:07.511 --> 07:11.515
And you might take a look
at this evening's Gotham <i>City Times.</i>

07:11.682 --> 07:13.851
- The <i>Gotham City Times?
-That's right.</i>

07:14.018 --> 07:16.479
The society section. Hwah, hwah.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.361
<i>What was that about
the Gotham City Times?</i>

07:23.527 --> 07:27.239
He said something about the society page.
Let's see if I can find it.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.205
- Oh, no.
-What is it, Bruce?

07:34.372 --> 07:36.040
What does it say?

07:36.374 --> 07:40.795
"The Penguin, well-known entrepreneur
and man-about-town announced today...

07:40.962 --> 07:44.882
...his forthcoming marriage to Ms. Barbara
Gordon, daughter of police commissioner--"

07:45.049 --> 07:46.592
Marriage?

07:46.759 --> 07:48.803
What's going on?
What does it mean, Bruce?

07:48.970 --> 07:51.889
Why, Barbara would never consent
to marry that scoundrel.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.892
Of course not, commissioner.
That's why he kidnapped her.

07:55.059 --> 07:57.728
He'll threaten her
and he'll force her to consent.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.648
- But why?
- By marrying your daughter...

08:00.815 --> 08:03.275
...Penguin becomes son-in-law
of the commissioner.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.237
Exactly, Dick.
He hopes to gain immunity from prosecution...

08:06.404 --> 08:09.740
...by becoming a member of the family,
as it were.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.869
And I think he fully intends
to go through with it, commissioner.

08:14.245 --> 08:17.248
There is only one man who can help me.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.000
Batman?

08:19.834 --> 08:20.918
Yes, chief.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.336
Batman.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.797
I'm afraid you'll have to go without us.

08:24.964 --> 08:27.383
Well, we're in no mood for the opera,
commissioner.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.761
If there's anything I can do,
you can telephone me at Wayne Manor.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.597
Thank you, Bruce,
from the bottom of a father's heart.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.934
Yeah, my sweet guinea hen.

08:38.102 --> 08:42.773
Soon, you and I will be joined
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.401
Really, Penguin,
all that waddling around you do...

08:45.568 --> 08:47.319
...must have scrambled your brains.

08:47.486 --> 08:50.448
Don't be cocky, my little chicken.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.576
If you won't marry me,
I'll have to put plan B into operation...

08:53.743 --> 08:56.120
...which is being rehearsed right over there.

08:56.287 --> 09:00.041
Show plan B to my little bride-to-be, boys.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.133
Penguin, you monster.
You wouldn't dare hurt my father.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.844
Oh, yes, I would, and I will.

09:12.011 --> 09:13.679
Now, you make up your mind.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.348
Either you become my bride
or you become an orphan.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.641
Which is it?

09:19.018 --> 09:20.811
- Put plan B into operation.
-No.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.522
I'll marry you. Just leave my father alone.

09:23.689 --> 09:27.902
That's what I like to hear. Obedience.
That is the first wifely virtue.

09:28.069 --> 09:31.822
Now, a couple of you finks go on out,
and put the snatch on a minister. Quick.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.532
What kind of minister, Pengy?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.159
Any minister, you fink.

09:35.326 --> 09:36.952
I wanna get this thing over with...

09:37.119 --> 09:39.955
...before the Dynamic Dunderheads
put the snatch on me.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.000
Don't worry, boss.
We'll get you to the church on time.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.336
That's it. Here you are, my love.

09:45.503 --> 09:51.008
Now, I'll tell you that in the adjacent bedroom
is a lovely wedding gown.

09:51.175 --> 09:55.471
I want you to put it on and wear it
with radiance like any blushing bride.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.348
I am not blushing.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.517
- I'm furious!
-Ooh.

10:12.113 --> 10:14.698
Yes, commissioner. Mm.

10:15.366 --> 10:16.742
Yes, I suspected as much.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.287
Robin and I knew something was wrong
as soon as we saw the evening paper.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.707
We'll use the Batcomputer
to make a list of all of Penguin's hideouts.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.377
We'll telephone as soon as it finishes.

10:26.544 --> 10:28.879
We'll get her back, commissioner.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.174
Where's Alfred?
He can give us a hand with the computations.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.927
Unfortunately, Robin,
he's out for the evening.

10:35.094 --> 10:37.930
He's meeting with his minister
to discuss a church supper.

10:38.097 --> 10:41.183
I do hope the church supper
is a success, Alfred.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.936
We badly need the money
for our summer camp.

10:44.103 --> 10:47.022
- I'm sure it will be, Reverend Hazlitt.
-If it is successful...

10:47.189 --> 10:50.568
...the congregation will owe you
a great debt of thanks.

10:50.734 --> 10:54.488
The only thanks I need is the knowledge
that some underprivileged youngsters...

10:54.655 --> 10:58.909
...will have a chance to enjoy a few weeks
in the country this summer.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.245
All right, which one of you is the minister?

11:02.413 --> 11:05.082
- Why do you ask?
-Because we're taking him with us, pops.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.085
- Are you it'?
-Yes.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.504
- Wait--
I shall be quite all right, I assure you.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.424
Tie that one up.
I'll take the preacher back to the hideout.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.010
- Move it, preach.
-I beg your pardon?

11:18.262 --> 11:20.097
I said, move it.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.057
Of course.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.477
Did you hear something, Robin?

11:28.981 --> 11:31.317
It's Alfred's emergency
belt-buckle Batcall signal.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.028
- He's in trouble.
-Holy complications.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.281
First Barbara Gordon is kidnapped,
now Alfred is in trouble.

11:37.448 --> 11:40.159
Yes, it's just possible
that the two events are related.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.368
But how, Batman?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.162
I don't know. Yet.

11:43.329 --> 11:46.165
The first thing to do is to locate Alfred.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.626
Man the Batradarscope.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.252
Roger.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.631
- Batradarscope on.
-Check.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.968
I'll feed Alfred's signal
into the Batradarscope.

11:58.636 --> 12:03.015
Got it. He's at location B-7642.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.479
"B-7642."

12:08.646 --> 12:10.981
Holy complications indeed, Robin.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.943
This is one of Penguin's possible hideouts.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.819
To the Batmobile.

12:23.077 --> 12:25.120
A number one hitch and no slipup.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.998
Now, the ravishing bride is in there.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.584
Come on, coach her on her lines.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.878
If I don't hear a nice "I do"...

12:33.045 --> 12:37.007
...you'll be visiting heaven
instead of talking about it.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.352
- Miss?
-Reverend.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.854
There's no time to explain.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.524
I must trust in your discretion
as a man of the cloth.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.609
You mustn't reveal my secret.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.029
But I don't know your secret.
I don't even know who you are.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.554
Not now, Charlie. I'm in a hurry.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.314
<i>NARRATOR".
What in the world is this?</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:35.566
<i>Revolving walls?</i>

13:35.733 --> 13:37.026
<i>Hidden rooms?</i>

13:37.192 --> 13:41.905
<i>Disguises?
What is Barbara Gordon's secret?</i>

13:45.993 --> 13:49.246
You are about to witness
the coup of the century.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.165
The world's leading arch criminal...

13:51.332 --> 13:55.002
...becomes the son-in-law
of the police commissioner.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.880
I don't know whether to call him "Daddy"
or just "commish."

13:58.047 --> 14:01.425
If I were you, Penguin,
I'd call help right now.

14:01.592 --> 14:05.137
When we get through with you,
you'll be hollering "uncle" instead of "Daddy."

14:05.304 --> 14:06.930
Oh, you bungling buttinskies...

14:07.097 --> 14:09.224
...always sticking your nose
into my business.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.226
This time I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

14:11.393 --> 14:15.105
As long as you're holding classes, Penguin,
perhaps you'd include Batgirl too.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.025
"Batgirl?
"Batgirl?

14:18.192 --> 14:19.485
"Batgirl?
"Batgirl?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.071
Bats. I'm surrounded by bats.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.865
Never mind. I'll teach you a lesson myself.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.992
Go on. Go on.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.286
Give it to them!

14:46.637 --> 14:48.055
Well, get them over here!

15:07.491 --> 15:11.245
I don't know who you are, but you
certainly know how to handle yourself well.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.080
Holy agility, I'll say.

15:13.247 --> 15:17.167
Thank you, Dynamic Duo. I'm sure you could've
handled these crooks without my help...

15:17.334 --> 15:20.421
...but I was glad for the chance
to join in the fun.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.632
I can understand your enjoyment.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.844
However, our purpose here is quite serious.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.680
Oh, crime fighting is a serious matter
to me too, Batman...

15:29.847 --> 15:32.182
...but we might as well
get a few laughs out of it.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.685
Perhaps some other time.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.688
Criminals like Penguin
are dangerous and deadly.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.233
We'd better see if
Barbara Gordon's all right.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.904
- Are you all right in there?
-Quite, sir.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.240
- Who's that?
- Alfred.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.160
Millionaire Bruce Wayne's butler, sir.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.246
We'll have you out
as soon as we can Bat-pick this lock, Alfred.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.039
Bat-tools, Robin.

15:57.124 --> 16:02.463
Of course, we could always borrow
a hairpin from Batgi--

16:02.629 --> 16:03.922
She's gone.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.675
Shouldn't we go after her?
At least find out who she is?

16:06.842 --> 16:08.051
Not now, Robin.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.554
Let's get back to work on this lock.

16:24.526 --> 16:28.697
Yeah.
So much for the Masked Meddlers, huh?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.742
Now, hurry up. UP- UP-

16:31.909 --> 16:34.411
Oh, we must get to our alternate hideout.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.831
The fuzz will be all over the place.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

16:39.249 --> 16:44.087
Over here. I want you to bag
those Dim Dynamics there...

16:44.254 --> 16:47.090
...and throw them out the window
into the truck.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.093
We'll take care of them later.
Get out of the way.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.261
Get them over here.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.764
Let me get these two in here.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.767
I got another key.

16:57.809 --> 17:02.439
All right. Now, bag that preacher
and my prospective bride-to-be, will you?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.319
Bring her over here.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.781
Hurry up, you clods. Hurry up, will you?

17:10.948 --> 17:14.242
Throw them out.
Come on, you two, throw them out.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.829
Close that bag. That's right.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.455
Over here. Get them.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.626
Throw them over here.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.383
Now, lower yourselves. Lower yourselves.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.052
Oh, yeah. Now the groom.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.650
All right, take it away!

17:59.830 --> 18:02.708
<i>NARRATOR".
Now what? Another surprise?</i>

18:02.874 --> 18:06.670
<i>A Batgirl Cycle in a secret freight elevator?</i>

18:07.337 --> 18:11.592
<i>Here comes the bride, all bagged and tied</i>

18:28.609 --> 18:30.527
Well, Dynamic Dupes...

18:30.694 --> 18:33.697
...how does it feel to be a couple
of human tea bags?

18:33.864 --> 18:36.241
Steaming us to death will do you no good,
Penguin.

18:36.408 --> 18:41.705
- The law will get you in the end.
-I am merely going to dunk you a little.

18:41.872 --> 18:47.002
But before I do dunk you, I think
I'll let my prospective bride out of the bag...

18:47.169 --> 18:49.921
...so she can see what'll happen
if she doesn't cooperate.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.803
Get out, little cutie pie. Come on--

18:56.970 --> 18:58.138
Oh, it's the preacher.

18:58.305 --> 19:03.393
Well, you better watch the dunking too,
in case you get any ideas of making trouble.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.228
Now my little bride.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.397
Oh, excuse me, sir.

19:07.564 --> 19:11.193
Hwah! Grab him. Grab him. Grab him.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.945
Oh, it's into the pot with you, sir...

19:14.112 --> 19:16.490
...right after you've performed my marriage,
yeah?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.369
Before you throw everyone in the pot,
Penguin...

19:20.535 --> 19:22.287
...you may find yourself in hot water.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.915
Batgirl. How did you find this place?

19:25.082 --> 19:27.292
I just adore weddings, Penguin.

19:27.459 --> 19:30.087
Well, funerals before weddings, Batgirl.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.047
Get her.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.105
- Alfred's really giving it to them.
-So is Batgirl.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.863
Sorry it took me so long, sir,
but I had a little bird trouble on the way. Ha, ha.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.120
Hwah, hwah, hwah!

20:15.632 --> 20:16.967
You're not a minister at all.

20:17.134 --> 20:19.678
I heard you tell Batman
you were Bruce Wayne's butler.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.639
Yes. I'm afraid that's true, Ms. Gordon--
Uh, Batgirl.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.062
You tricked me into revealing my secret
by posing as a minister.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.106
But I had no intention of tricking you.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
I only took the Reverend Hazlitt's place...

20:33.442 --> 20:37.654
...because I wanted to protect him
from being injured by Penguin's thugs.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.364
Well, then I apologize.

20:39.531 --> 20:42.367
That was a very brave thing to do, Alfred.

20:45.996 --> 20:49.332
But the fact remains, you do know my secret,
my dual identity.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.752
And you must swear never to reveal it
to anyone.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.629
- Well, really, Batgirl, I--
-No, Alfred, you must swear.

20:54.796 --> 20:59.676
If you reveal my identity to anyone,
I'll be of no further use as a crime-fighter.

21:06.016 --> 21:09.352
You wouldn't take advantage
of a woman's trust, would you?

21:09.686 --> 21:13.857
Now, you must swear,
as a gentleman's gentleman.

21:14.858 --> 21:15.901
Very well.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.529
You have my word
as a gentleman's gentleman...

21:19.696 --> 21:22.574
...that no one will ever learn
your secret from me.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.576
Thank you, Alfred.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.078
I must make a quick change.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.707
It's time to bag the bird, huh, Batman?

21:30.874 --> 21:32.167
I think so, Robin.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.044
Birds are out of season. Get away.

21:34.211 --> 21:36.213
There'll be no bird-bagging here.

21:36.379 --> 21:42.636
Get away. Get away. Unhand me, you poacher.
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.392
- Where is Barbara Gordon?
-I placed her out sight...

21:49.559 --> 21:52.479
...to avoid all danger in the fighting.
-Good show, Alfred.

21:57.526 --> 21:58.819
What happened, Batman?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.112
Is that horrible man gone?

22:01.279 --> 22:04.407
He's temporarily out of circulation.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.951
Are you all right, Ms. Gordon?

22:06.117 --> 22:08.912
Yes, just never been proposed to
at umbrellapoint before.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.248
You're quite safe now, Ms. Gordon.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.416
His umbrellas are closed.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.752
Thanks to you, Batman.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.838
I'm sorry to be so helpless.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.550
Alfred, where's Batgirl?

22:21.716 --> 22:23.552
Oh, she left a few minutes ago, sir.

22:23.718 --> 22:26.680
She said she had other business
to attend to.

22:27.264 --> 22:29.933
I expect we haven't seen the last of her.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.102
I shouldn't be at all surprised, sir.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.937
Who is this Batgirl?

22:34.104 --> 22:36.147
That's what we'd all like to know.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.192
Whoever she is behind that mask of hers...

22:39.359 --> 22:42.153
- ...she helped us out of a dire dilemma.
- Oh, yes.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.574
Think how horrible it would have been
to be married to the Penguin.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.242
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.620
Horrible? To be married to me? Fa.

22:50.787 --> 22:54.291
You can't imagine such bliss.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.633
Fine score on your driving test.
How does it feel to have a license?

23:03.800 --> 23:07.095
Well, it's gonna be a little easier on Batman
now that Robin can drive.

23:07.262 --> 23:10.640
Let's, uh, stick to Dick Grayson
for a moment.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.977
How would you like to, uh, drive this?

23:19.274 --> 23:20.817
This? Me?

23:20.984 --> 23:25.030
Since you got your license on your birthday,
you deserve a little something special.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.824
A little something?
Gosh, Bruce, this is great.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.951
Oh, this is great, Chief O'Hara.

23:30.118 --> 23:33.747
A very sizable check from millionaire
Bruce Wayne for our police pension fund.

23:33.914 --> 23:37.000
Ha, ha! I must call him at once
and thank him.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.713
- Bonnie? Bonnie--?
- Ha, ha.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.089
- What--?
<i>- Riddle me this.</i>

23:43.256 --> 23:44.841
Good heavens, the Riddler.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.509
Very good.

23:46.676 --> 23:50.013
Now, when is a jet stream like a daffodil?

23:50.180 --> 23:53.141
A jet stream like a daffodil?

23:53.308 --> 23:55.518
Riddler. Riddler.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.520
He's gone. But what--?

23:57.687 --> 24:00.565
Bonnie told me we had trouble
with cross lines all morning.

24:00.732 --> 24:04.361
Then I'd better cross Riddler's line
with Batman's, quick.

24:04.527 --> 24:08.865
<i>NARRATOR". The Riddler, back to puzzle
and perplex the Dynamic Duo?</i>

24:09.032 --> 24:11.409
<i>Be sure to watch the next episode.</i>

24:12.786 --> 24:13.995
Gosh, Bruce, what's that?

24:14.162 --> 24:18.917
It's a Bat-alert Buzzer connected to the phone
in the Batcave as in our other cars. Let's go.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.799
Remember, this is not the Batmobile.

24:25.966 --> 24:29.886
Don't worry, Bruce. Highway safety
is every citizen's prime responsibility.
