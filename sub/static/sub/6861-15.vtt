WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:04.938
Dad, I didn't get
the fellowship.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.006
You still believe in me,
though, right?

00:06.006 --> 00:06.939
He knew, didn't he?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.209
Zoe, I can explain.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.310
What's there to explain?

00:09.310 --> 00:10.878
Why Harley left
me the practice?

00:10.878 --> 00:12.313
Why Dad stopped loving me?

00:12.313 --> 00:14.448
I was trying to get over
someone, and I shouldn't

00:14.448 --> 00:16.149
have dated, but I wanted
to, because I like you.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.252
DIDI: No one knows what's gonna
 happen between two people.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.754
Until yesterday,
 I was having such a good time.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.357
He's hung up on someone, and
I think that someone is Lemon.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.526
Didi has been avoiding me
because she found this.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.495
Oh, my God. You have
got to keep this secret.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.130
Look, Didi, the picture's mine.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.631
I'm just so relieved!

00:30.631 --> 00:32.366
I am driving to
Mobile to pick up

00:32.366 --> 00:34.768
fabric for the bridesmaids
dresses, I meeting with the

00:34.768 --> 00:36.937
the caterer, I'm gonna reconfirm
our block of rooms at the...

00:36.937 --> 00:39.006
Okay, okay, you know what?
That's way too much stuff.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.342
We shouldn't be sitting here,
waiting and planning.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.711
That's not life, George.
What are you saying?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.113
Let's elope.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.048
* *

00:55.256 --> 00:58.359
Hey! Come back here!

00:58.359 --> 01:00.561
I'm gonna get you.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.497
(splat)

01:03.497 --> 01:04.965
Hey!

01:04.965 --> 01:06.167
Wait for me!

01:06.167 --> 01:07.535
Yeah, you'd better run.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.872
Hey. Finally, BlueBell
does something right. Snow!

01:11.872 --> 01:14.175
Look, it's
so pretty!

01:14.175 --> 01:15.843
I can't see pretty.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.645
I can only see doom.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.080
Only snows in BlueBell
every once in a while.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.150
When it does,
bad things happen.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.552
Last time, we had
our first-ever traffic jam.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.389
Fire broke out in the mystery
section of the library.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.258
We lost our whole
James Patterson collection.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.593
So, how does snow cause a fire?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.862
'Cause the fool librarian
busted out space heaters

01:34.862 --> 01:37.998
that hadn't been used since
Lady Bird Johnson was in town.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.033
Burt Reynolds was freezing.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.502
I bought him some boots,

01:41.502 --> 01:44.305
but they turned out
to be made of alligator, so...

01:44.305 --> 01:46.140
And then, of course,
today, of all days,

01:46.140 --> 01:47.975
my parents decide
to fly in from Houston

01:47.975 --> 01:49.277
and surprise me with a visit.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.078
What?!
Yeah.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.580
Big day for Lavon Hayes!

01:52.580 --> 01:54.582
Parents meeting the girlfriend.
Whoa.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.384
Hey, don't you think
it's a little early

01:56.384 --> 01:57.818
for her to meet the parents?

01:57.818 --> 01:59.052
Have you met Didi?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.988
The woman is a delight.

02:00.988 --> 02:05.226
My mama has been worried about
my lack of a significant other.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.161
They've been wanting me
to settle down.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.862
So, you and Didi
are settling down?

02:08.862 --> 02:11.365
We're not settling down.
I'm just saying,

02:11.365 --> 02:12.566
I'm ready to commit.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.436
So, yeah...

02:15.436 --> 02:18.206
we are getting serious.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.041
Well... okay.
Good for you.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.077
Hope you're gonna come
to dinner, too, meet my parents?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.346
I wouldn't miss it, just as long

02:25.346 --> 02:27.114
as I don't have
to sit next to Wade.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.383
When are y'all gonna make up?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.018
When that spineless infant
apologizes

02:31.018 --> 02:33.187
for breaking up me and Judson.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.555
I'll see you later.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.823
Be careful.

02:35.823 --> 02:36.957
(scoffs)

02:36.957 --> 02:40.628
Lavon! It's just... snow!

02:42.230 --> 02:44.064
I'm okay!

02:44.064 --> 02:48.236
Let me just say:
BlueBell snow-- bad.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.870
Now, I know
it's your fishing day, Marv,

02:49.870 --> 02:52.240
but did you even check
if the bay was frozen

02:52.240 --> 02:53.541
before stepping out
on the ice?

02:53.541 --> 02:55.409
Ice is invisible, Brick.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.110
You can't see it.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.480
Hey, Addy?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.081
Mm?
I am expecting

03:01.081 --> 03:02.250
an important phone call
from Germany,

03:02.250 --> 03:04.218
so be sure to get me
when it comes in.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.986
Oh, who do you know
in Germany?
My dad.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.888
Your dad?

03:07.888 --> 03:10.424
Oh. Uh, yeah, I remembered
it was his birthday,

03:10.424 --> 03:12.760
so I sent him his favorite
macaroons from Paris.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.628
He'll be calling
to say thanks.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.764
I left the office number
and my cell

03:16.764 --> 03:18.332
on the return slip.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.534
What kind of father doesn't know
his own daughter's phone number?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.503
Well, he's very busy.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.672
You know, he's the top
cardiothoracic surgeon

03:24.672 --> 03:27.941
in Europe, and they smoke a lot
over there, so you can imagine.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.344
ADDY:
Well, also, there's
that difficult discussion

03:30.344 --> 03:31.545
you've both been avoiding.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.282
The one about how
you finally discovered

03:34.282 --> 03:36.317
you're not biologically related.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.719
Mm, yeah, and that.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.021
BRICK:
Sounds like the man
has purposely distanced

03:41.021 --> 03:42.556
himself a-a bit...

03:42.556 --> 03:44.191
He wasn't distancing himself
from me.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.026
He was distancing himself
from my mom

03:46.026 --> 03:47.895
and the pain
that she caused him.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.463
He's still my dad.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.165
You know, even though
we haven't spoken in a while,

03:52.165 --> 03:54.435
that's never gonna change.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.570
Well, I'll let you know
when he calls.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.972
WADE:
 Apologize to Zoe?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.041
Forget it. She's not
even nice to me.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.176
Well, at least be nice to her.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.379
My parents are meeting
Didi tonight.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.281
I don't need
any additional worries.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.483
Moms and Pops Hayes
are gonna love Didi.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.319
I mean, what's
not to love?

04:11.319 --> 04:12.886
I can't do it!
I can't...

04:12.886 --> 04:15.823
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

04:15.823 --> 04:17.425
I can't meet your parents
on snow day!

04:17.425 --> 04:18.692
I've heard. I've heard
the terrible tales.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.494
They're gonna hate me,

04:20.494 --> 04:21.829
or we'll be electrocuted.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.996
Probably both!

04:22.996 --> 04:25.065
Didi, I know
the weather is foreboding now,

04:25.065 --> 04:26.199
but everything's gonna be fine.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.301
Well, you got
to understand.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.569
Lavon's parents
are, like,

04:28.569 --> 04:30.237
pretty much the coolest
people you ever met.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.873
His dad, Ernie,
is so funny.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.207
You guys should see
the impression

04:34.207 --> 04:35.343
he does of Little Wayne.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.745
I mean, it is...
Oh! And Carolyn?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.480
She's like the mom
you never had.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.182
But I have a mother.
She's amazing.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.851
Not really.
Not like Carolyn.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.486
Lavon,

04:45.486 --> 04:47.821
are you sure your parents
are going to like me?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.222
I am sure.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.624
Okay. Then I just realized

04:50.624 --> 04:52.793
I'm wearing
the totally wrong outfit.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.329
And I think I left my stove on.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.364
Whoa, whoa.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.666
Whoa. Whoa.
(laughing)

05:01.502 --> 05:04.972
They are gonna love her, right?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.441
Long as the snow lets up.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.745
LEMON:
 Okay, what about

05:11.745 --> 05:14.081
the tenth?
Uh-uh. I got to be
in court that Monday.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.450
Okay, and the weekend after,
I have my bachelorette party.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.685
If I cancelled,
everyone will know.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.354
Okay, well, then,
we have no choice.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.656
We're doing it today.
Today?! It's
snowing outside.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.358
Are you trying to
doom our marriage?

05:24.358 --> 05:26.360
Look, we are not
gonna be able to elope

05:26.360 --> 05:27.761
without this entire town
knowing about it,

05:27.761 --> 05:30.097
anyway, so I say,
we get out of town.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.632
I say we go somewhere,

05:31.632 --> 05:34.034
I say we have a nice,

05:34.034 --> 05:35.536
romantic night in a hotel...

05:35.536 --> 05:37.438
Mmm.
and we get married
tomorrow morning.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.673
Okay, now,
I've read in a magazine

05:39.673 --> 05:43.444
that Charleston is the number
two destination for weddings.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.778
Whoo! So spontaneous!

05:44.778 --> 05:46.947
I love it. I'm in, I'm in.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.216
Okay, babe, hold on.
Just... one second.

05:49.216 --> 05:52.920
I just want to make sure this is
really want you want to do.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.855
I just want you to know,
we can still have the wedding.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.324
You can still have
the white dress...

05:57.324 --> 05:59.292
Hey, George, all of the stress

05:59.292 --> 06:01.328
from this damn wedding
is killing us.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.564
I just want to marry you

06:03.564 --> 06:06.133
as fast as I can
in the first dress I find,

06:06.133 --> 06:10.070
and I don't care if it is white
or off-white or...

06:10.070 --> 06:12.773
ivory.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.642
(laughs)

06:18.446 --> 06:20.448
(sighs)

06:20.448 --> 06:22.416
Ooh!
Oh!

06:22.416 --> 06:23.851
Sorry I drove so slow.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.786
Can't take any
chances on a snow day.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.155
Well, it's not like
we're going to get stranded

06:28.155 --> 06:29.890
and have to eat each other, son.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.224
(laughs)
Oh.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.426
Oh, man.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.294
Oh, hey, y'all got
to hear my band.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.329
You know, we got a
bunch of new songs.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.599
We got one
called "Lightning."

06:38.599 --> 06:40.468
It's about a dog
who shows up

06:40.468 --> 06:41.835
in a lighting storm.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.504
Yeah, well, I don't want
to give too much away,

06:43.504 --> 06:44.572
but I can go grab my guitar.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.173
I'd be happy to play it for you.

06:46.173 --> 06:50.243
It sounds wonderful, Wade, but
right now, we're pretty tired.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.780
So, Dad, how are things going
at the Lavon Hayes Steakhouse?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.482
Amazing. It's the greatest gift

06:54.482 --> 06:55.883
I ever got.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.751
It's the one thing
in the world I can count on.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.887
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.555
I didn't want to drive
and end up in a snow drift

07:01.555 --> 07:05.158
and have to be rescued like in
that movie Misery, so I walked.

07:05.158 --> 07:09.029
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is my girlfriend, Didi.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.765
Oh.
Didi, oh, honey,
it's so nice to meet you.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.534
Hi.
Well,
hello there, Didi.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.504
I have heard so much
about you both.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.972
Mr. Hayes, you have a
restaurant in Houston.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.340
I love... food.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.375
I eat it every day.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.811
And Mrs. Hayes,

07:23.811 --> 07:25.513
you were a teacher.
That's so great.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.748
What is it that they
say about teachers?

07:27.748 --> 07:30.684
"Those who can, do; those
who can't... teach."

07:30.684 --> 07:33.453
No, that's not
the right one.
(laughing)

07:33.453 --> 07:36.524
LAVON:
Anyway, we're just so glad
you decided to come for a visit.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.492
I mean, what
brings you to
town, though?

07:38.492 --> 07:39.827
I thought y'all
was waiting

07:39.827 --> 07:41.862
for your big 40th
anniversary next month.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.799
Uh, Lavon, if you wouldn't mind,

07:45.799 --> 07:48.869
your father and I would like
to speak to you in private.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.106
BRICK:
 All right, folks.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.908
Would you just listen up
here, please?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.677
Just stay inside today,
'cause we all know

07:56.677 --> 07:59.346
weird things are happening.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.781
The weird thing is

08:00.781 --> 08:03.083
how these people function
every other day of the year.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.852
Oh, hey, don't forget
I'm next, okay?

08:04.852 --> 08:05.318
Mm.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.154
(grunts)

08:07.154 --> 08:09.022
Oh.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.323
(ringtone playing)

08:10.323 --> 08:11.925
Hey, Lavon, can I call you back?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.962
I just wanted to let you know
there's no need to rush home.

08:14.962 --> 08:19.166
My parents just told me
they're...

08:19.166 --> 08:21.168
they're splitting up.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.470
Oh, Lavon, I am so sorry.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.472
Happy snow day, huh?

08:25.472 --> 08:26.874
(sighs)

08:26.874 --> 08:28.909
See?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.551
(seabirds chirping)

08:42.722 --> 08:43.857
DIDI:
 This is a terrible way

08:43.857 --> 08:45.192
to meet your parents.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.994
I wanted them to like me.
Now, I'm just

08:46.994 --> 08:49.129
a witness
to their marital disaster.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.531
Yeah, well, I wanted them
to like you, too, Didi.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.967
You know, my parents'
relationship always inspired me.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.904
I wanted them to see that
I could find happiness, too.

08:56.904 --> 08:57.871
Mm.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.306
It's just really bad timing.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.974
We have to help them.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.676
Sometimes, a couple
just needs a little nudge

09:02.676 --> 09:04.144
to remember how they feel
about each other.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.146
You and I forgot,
then you paraded

09:06.146 --> 09:08.115
prostitutes through town,
and here we are.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.284
Yeah, I don't think my mom and
dad will respond to that method.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.154
What if we threw their
anniversary party tonight?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.189
You know, I appreciate
the thought...

09:16.189 --> 09:17.324
A romantic dinner

09:17.324 --> 09:18.992
with music they like,

09:18.992 --> 09:22.062
and everything to remind them
of why they fell in love!

09:22.062 --> 09:24.632
Didi, if they're fine
with their decision,

09:24.632 --> 09:27.200
then we have to be, too.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.201
Okay.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.038
But maybe you should
just double-check.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.642
Make sure they really are fine.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.976
We are fine, son.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.779
People grow apart.
It happens.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.181
You just can't take it so hard.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.384
I just keep thinking maybe
it was something I did.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.219
No, of course not, Wade.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.521
Look, it'll work out
better for you.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.891
Two birthdays,
two Christmases.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.392
It's just so sad.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.396
You know, 40 years next month.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.199
Well, I'm sorry, son.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.035
Oh, it just breaks my heart
to see a good couple split up

10:02.035 --> 10:05.605
over something like,
"we grew apart."

10:07.540 --> 10:09.743
Marriage is complicated.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.981
Well, thanks for the beer, Wade.

10:18.218 --> 10:22.155
Yeah, well, enjoy it now,
'cause it ain't gonna last!

10:24.825 --> 10:26.559
(softly):
Ow.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.495
(clears throat)
Ow.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.498
Oh, there was
a lot of blood,
which surprised me.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.802
'Cause, you know,
I've heard you can't
get blood from a stone.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.670
Oh, ha-ha. Maybe you
should worry more

10:36.670 --> 10:39.707
about the stitches
and save your standup
routine for later.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.608
I'm gonna have
Addy take you

10:41.608 --> 10:43.143
to Mobile for a CT scan

10:43.143 --> 10:45.578
so we can rule out
a cerebral contusion

10:45.578 --> 10:47.781
Oh.
or... a bleed.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.951
You know, I don't
need a CT scan.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.386
All I need is a
nice, warm day...

10:53.386 --> 10:54.755
Whoa.
That's it.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.489
Addy, can you
come in here?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.858
(sighs)

10:57.858 --> 10:59.993
Oh, as your doctor--
or, sorry, at least

10:59.993 --> 11:02.730
as the person treating you--
I insist that you go home

11:02.730 --> 11:04.097
and lie down.
No.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.532
Addy, can you please
drive him home?

11:05.532 --> 11:07.801
I don't need
a ride home. I...
Oh, hush now,

11:07.801 --> 11:10.337
or I will whack you on the
other side of that head.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.472
Oh, hey, Addy.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.041
Hmm?
Was there a...?

11:14.041 --> 11:17.344
Oh, I'm sorry,
still no call from your dad.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.051
(quiet sigh)

11:25.085 --> 11:26.920
(sniffles)

11:28.021 --> 11:29.489
Mom.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.124
You okay?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.325
Oh, yeah.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.927
Just the onions, honey.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.329
You're not cutting onions.
Well, see, that's
why I'm crying--

11:36.329 --> 11:37.464
I really wanted onions.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.801
Mom, maybe this ain't
the right decision.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.402
Maybe you and Dad

11:42.402 --> 11:43.904
shouldn't be splitting up.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.172
Lavon, your father and I

11:45.172 --> 11:47.274
are just not
the couple we used to be.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.377
Doesn't mean
it isn't sad.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.145
Now, go wash up.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.413
Go on.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.948
(sniffles)

11:54.948 --> 11:58.385
(resumes chopping vegetables)

11:58.385 --> 11:59.652
LAVON:
Didi, Didi.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.221
You were right--
they're not okay.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.056
Call Wade,
'cause we're gonna

12:03.056 --> 12:05.759
throw my parents a big-ass
get-back-together party.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.527
Wow! All right!

12:07.527 --> 12:09.096
(laughing)

12:11.932 --> 12:15.035
Lemon? I got my suit,
got the rings.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.503
Your carriage awaits.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.105
Sweetheart,

12:18.105 --> 12:19.973
there's been a change of plans!

12:19.973 --> 12:21.708
MAGNOLIA:
Is it going to be

12:21.708 --> 12:25.245
snowing in Charleston,
because I am not wearing
this dress with boots.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.182
She caught me
trying on my dress.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.451
She is my sister, so...

12:31.451 --> 12:34.254
And the maid of honor.
(George chuckles)

12:34.988 --> 12:37.757
O-Okay, well...

12:37.757 --> 12:39.960
all right, then,
let's hit the road.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.429
Shotgun!
No.
No.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.097
Well, hey, kids.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.432
What are y'all doing?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.101
Uh, it's a field trip.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.602
Yeah. A field trip.
Uh-huh.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.838
So, ladies,
we should...

12:50.838 --> 12:51.839
To the art museum!

12:51.839 --> 12:53.440
GEORGE:
Yeah. Art museum.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.242
Whoa, Daddy, what happened?

12:55.242 --> 12:57.777
Oh, you know, I banged my
head into a surfboard...

12:57.777 --> 13:02.482
No, it was a snowboard, and
I'm just gonna go lie down.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.386
You just all have
a good time at the museum.
Okay, Daddy, stop.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.857
Um... I have
to tell you something.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.291
Uh, so...

13:11.291 --> 13:13.560
George and I are
driving to Charleston...

13:13.560 --> 13:16.029
and we're getting
married in the morning.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.430
And Magnolia's

13:17.430 --> 13:18.698
coming with us.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.133
Will you come with us, too?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.768
BRICK:
Y-You're eloping?

13:21.768 --> 13:23.871
I-I mean, no church,

13:23.871 --> 13:26.106
no party, no...

13:26.106 --> 13:28.275
walking you
down the aisle?
Daddy, I'm
so sorry.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.010
I know that
this must be...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.579
really disappointing.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.482
Well...

13:36.449 --> 13:38.485
Not at all.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.619
Lemon-meringue,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.654
I would love
to go to Charleston.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.490
Really? (laughing)
Yeah.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.159
Oh, Daddy, thank you!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.560
Really, Brick?
Well, I mean,

13:47.560 --> 13:49.829
you two want to save me
thousands of dollars

13:49.829 --> 13:51.764
on a wedding,
hell, yes,

13:51.764 --> 13:53.700
be my guest.
But, uh,

13:53.700 --> 13:56.703
there's a couple of
things that I have
to take care of first.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.905
So, uh, just call me

13:57.905 --> 13:59.339
with the details,
and then
Okay.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.308
I'll meet you
there, okay?

14:01.308 --> 14:03.911
Great.
You know, I think
this is gonna be

14:03.911 --> 14:05.913
just... great.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.548
Oh, Daddy, I
love you so much.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.816
(car horn honks)

14:09.816 --> 14:11.484
Hold your horses,
I'm coming!

14:11.484 --> 14:12.986
(giggles)

14:13.820 --> 14:16.389
(door opens)

14:16.389 --> 14:18.691
(knocks)
Line two.
It's long distance.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.093
Europe!

14:21.661 --> 14:23.396
Hi, Daddy!

14:24.597 --> 14:27.267
Wait. I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.835
What do you mean no one
named Ethan Hart

14:28.835 --> 14:30.270
lives at that address?

14:30.270 --> 14:32.405
He's my father-- I think
I know where he lives.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.873
What...?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.409
I see.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.878
(dial tone drones)

14:40.013 --> 14:42.115
Oh, Zoe, honey, I'm sorry.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.252
It's okay. It was
obviously a mistake.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.587
I mean, those stupid
German street names

14:47.587 --> 14:48.989
are so confusing.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.992
I'm just gonna have
to call my father myself.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.494
It's totally gonna
ruin the surprise.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.230
(line ringing)

14:57.230 --> 14:58.932
(sighs)

14:58.932 --> 15:01.668
(disconnect tones sounding)

15:01.668 --> 15:02.835
Oh.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.272
(sets handset in cradle)

15:10.110 --> 15:11.378
There has to be an
explanation for this.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.246
I mean, my father
didn't just vanish.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.848
Oh, my God.
He is a very important surgeon.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.118
Do you think one
of those organizations

15:18.118 --> 15:20.187
maybe kidnapped him for ransom?

15:20.187 --> 15:22.722
Or they need a doctor.
Uh, no.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.723
No.
No.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.824
Me, neither.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.293
Maybe he sent his
new information

15:26.293 --> 15:28.461
to my old e-mail account
at New York Hospital!

15:28.461 --> 15:30.430
I'm gonna check it.
Uh, no, you won't.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.199
A big rig just
slid on the ice

15:32.199 --> 15:35.202
and smashed into the
pole that carries the
town's Internet cable.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.139
Okay. So, then, I...

15:39.139 --> 15:41.975
will sit here, steaming,

15:41.975 --> 15:44.911
because the hospital Web site
won't let you check your account

15:44.911 --> 15:46.679
(tosses cell phone)
from your cell phone!

15:46.679 --> 15:48.215
Damn it!

15:48.215 --> 15:52.185
I'm gonna get online somehow,
get to the bottom of this.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.756
Honey, why don't you wait
until tomorrow,

15:56.756 --> 15:57.857
when the snow'll stop

15:57.857 --> 15:59.292
bringing its bad luck.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.194
'Cause I am a scientist,
and scientists may have

16:01.194 --> 16:03.030
different theories on how
the dinosaurs died off,

16:03.030 --> 16:04.564
but not one of them

16:04.564 --> 16:07.367
ever said it's because
it was snowing that day.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.037
Because there was ice.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.071
If your parents

16:11.071 --> 16:12.239
are splitting up,

16:12.239 --> 16:14.107
why would they come
to a dinner party?

16:14.107 --> 16:17.510
I said I'm owed a final
dinner with my mom and
dad as a married couple!

16:17.510 --> 16:18.811
And then I kind of

16:18.811 --> 16:21.248
let my voice get all crackly
like I was choking back tears.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.582
DIDI:
I saw him.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.651
He milked it good.
Wait, maybe if
your parents

16:24.651 --> 16:26.919
have a favorite song,
I could learn it,

16:26.919 --> 16:28.388
and then, like, uh, you know...

16:28.388 --> 16:30.457
serenade 'em with it.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.792
Yeah, yeah. Uh,
"Kiss an Angel Good Morning"

16:32.792 --> 16:34.094
was their wedding song.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.463
Do they have a favorite
by Tom Petty?

16:36.463 --> 16:39.032
I'm gonna make
my famous spaghetti.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.333
Maybe they'll
share a bowl

16:40.333 --> 16:42.669
and end up sucking on
the same piece of pasta,

16:42.669 --> 16:43.936
like those dogs.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.906
Everybody should probably
have their own bowl of pasta.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.341
But I appreciate
the sentiment, though.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.210
Oh, do you have any
old pictures of them?

16:50.210 --> 16:52.212
Nothing makes a couple
get all gooey emotional

16:52.212 --> 16:54.047
like seeing themselves
together back in the day.

16:54.047 --> 16:57.217
Oh, oh, you know what, I have
some of their old slides.
Perfect!

16:57.217 --> 16:59.186
We can have a This
 Is Your Marriage show.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.387
I saw it on Dr. Phil.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.621
We'll show
them pictures

17:01.621 --> 17:03.490
of their wedding,
their honeymoon,

17:03.490 --> 17:06.093
their children,
everything that'll remind them

17:06.093 --> 17:07.827
of why they're
still together.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.963
Didi,you are a genius.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.098
Really.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.032
It isn't said enough.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.336
I know I've never heard it.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.542
Oh, hey.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.777
(shivers)

17:24.777 --> 17:26.113
Hey, Norbert.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.980
Hey, Doc.
Oh...

17:27.980 --> 17:30.817
Hey, listen...

17:30.817 --> 17:32.119
Whoa.
(laughs)

17:32.119 --> 17:35.855
Well, listen, I have
this, uh, vintage veil...

17:35.855 --> 17:37.924
Is that the right
word, "veil"?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.526
Anyway, it belonged

17:39.526 --> 17:43.396
to my mother, and I
want to give it to
my daughter, Magnolia,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.265
who is getting
married tomorrow.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.733
Magnolia's getting
married, too?
Shh!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.935
(whispers):
It is a secret...
All right.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.270
No, it's Lemon

17:50.270 --> 17:52.272
who's getting married.
Oh. (laughing)

17:52.272 --> 17:53.673
Yeah, sorry.
So anyway,

17:53.673 --> 17:56.776
so this veil is missing
a couple of, uh, of gems,

17:56.776 --> 17:58.278
you know, in the, uh...

17:58.278 --> 17:59.912
What do you call that?

17:59.912 --> 18:00.913
Tiara.
Yeah.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.082
Right, right.
Doc, uh...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.884
are you all right?

18:04.884 --> 18:06.419
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.621
Yeah. So we good for lunch?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.223
Lunch?
Launch.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.125
Good for launch?
Uh, yeah.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.626
Yeah, are we?
Yeah.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.528
Okay. Good-bye.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.466
You don't know anyone in this
town whose Internet service

18:19.466 --> 18:21.268
isn't messed up
by that pole that went down?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.735
I'm sorry, honey, but...

18:22.735 --> 18:24.804
sometimes it's good when
you can't get online,

18:24.804 --> 18:28.575
'cause it gives you a
chance to connect with a
real person for a change.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.043
Anybody have a satellite phone?!

18:31.043 --> 18:32.779
Sailors have satellite phones

18:32.779 --> 18:35.047
sometimes.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.516
No?

18:36.516 --> 18:37.784
'Kay.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.252
Go back to being

18:39.252 --> 18:41.454
no help at all.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.523
You, uh, you looking
for a hookup?

18:43.523 --> 18:46.159
Can you clarify what
you mean first?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.328
Internet. I've got
a dial-up connection.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.263
That's fantastic!
Let's go!

18:50.263 --> 18:53.500
(laughing):
Oh... I have waited so long
for that line to work.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.502
How far is your house?
Not far.
It's my mom's house,

18:55.502 --> 18:57.069
actually.
I live in the basement.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.805
The basement?
You do mean the basement

18:58.805 --> 19:00.139
and not a crawlspace, right?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.341
(laughs)

19:01.341 --> 19:04.244
No, seriously.
Wha...?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.748
(laughs)

19:08.748 --> 19:10.417
So, we got flowers?
We got champagne.
Yes.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.084
We got everything,
right? We can go
to Charleston now?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.387
Yes, unless you want to stop by
and get Oliver the organist.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.755
(laughs)
Very funny.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.257
(Lemon grunts)

19:17.257 --> 19:19.226
Magnolia, hold
that for me?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.760
Thanks.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.264
You know, you aren't supposed
to throw rice at weddings.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.065
It kills the birds.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.702
Well, aren't you a ray
of sunshine on a stormy day.
It's true.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.804
The birds eat it,
then they get so filled up

19:31.804 --> 19:33.440
on rice that
they don't want to eat

19:33.440 --> 19:34.774
anything else
that's good for them.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.175
And then they die.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.246
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's... not what happens.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.513
(laughs)

19:40.513 --> 19:43.983
(starter grinding,
engine stalling)

19:43.983 --> 19:45.985
(grinding continues)

19:45.985 --> 19:47.520
(engine stalling)

19:47.520 --> 19:49.722
(engine knocking and clicking)

19:49.722 --> 19:52.292
(engine dies)
Is there a problem?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.327
Magnolia.
Mm-hmm?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.862
Did you, uh...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.298
happen to, while you
were waiting for us,

19:58.298 --> 20:02.168
have the radio and
the interior lights on

20:02.168 --> 20:04.771
while you had the
heat on full-blast?

20:04.771 --> 20:05.872
Maybe.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.408
It's freezing outside,
but it's okay

20:08.408 --> 20:10.877
after a while;
it just turned off by itself.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.614
Snow day.
Snow day.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.616
ERNIE:
 I don't get it.
 Are we gonna eat

20:16.616 --> 20:18.951
at Fancie's or not?
I'm hungry.
Well, hang on,

20:18.951 --> 20:21.020
hang on; there's something
more important right now.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.422
I want to make a toast.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.258
Mom, Dad, uh, tonight we
want you to put a pause

20:25.258 --> 20:26.559
on all talk of separating.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.728
All right?
Tonight we honor

20:28.728 --> 20:30.229
your 40 great
years of marriage.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.298
ERNIE: Well,
make up your mind.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.399
You want to honor 40 years

20:32.399 --> 20:33.633
or just the great ones?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.735
(laughing)

20:35.735 --> 20:37.169
DIDI:
Now,

20:37.169 --> 20:40.172
a stroll down
memory lane.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.374
Oh.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.243
(indistinct chatter)

20:46.579 --> 20:48.315
WADE:
Coming over.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.483
Uh, sit back

20:50.483 --> 20:51.984
and enjoy
a little show

20:51.984 --> 20:55.355
I like to call Carolyn
 and Ernie: Love Never Dies.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.590
Ha. Hit it, Wade.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.891
(click)

20:58.891 --> 21:00.693
(playing ballad intro)

21:00.693 --> 21:02.862
* Whenever I chance to meet *

21:02.862 --> 21:04.864
(click)
* Some old friends
in the street *

21:04.864 --> 21:08.167
* They wonder how does a man
get to be this way? *

21:08.167 --> 21:09.636
(sizzling)

21:09.636 --> 21:12.805
* Any time they ask me why,
I just smile and say *

21:12.805 --> 21:13.940
(sizzling continues)

21:13.940 --> 21:15.475
Look, darling,

21:15.475 --> 21:16.576
there's no need to...

21:16.576 --> 21:17.644
I can fix this, I can...

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
Don't matter whether you can fix

21:18.845 --> 21:20.580
that damn machine,
you can't fix us.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.882
There's no point
in doing any of this.

21:22.882 --> 21:26.052
Your mother's in love
with another man.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.628
(door slams shut)

21:35.628 --> 21:39.566
This is not how
it went on Dr. Phil.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.777
You want to tell me
what Dad was talking about?

21:53.346 --> 21:54.881
I have, um...

21:54.881 --> 21:58.217
reconnected, through Facebook,
with a high school boyfriend,

21:58.217 --> 21:59.419
Dwayne.

21:59.419 --> 22:03.255
How long has this,
uh, reconnection

22:03.255 --> 22:06.359
with Dwayne been going on?

22:06.359 --> 22:08.361
About a year.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.630
Your father found out
a few weeks ago,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.932
insisted that I cut off all
communications with him.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.001
Your father--
I mean, I can't
tell you the last time

22:15.001 --> 22:16.803
he looked up at me
from the sports pages,

22:16.803 --> 22:20.407
let alone, you know,
take me out on a date.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.274
I thought every Friday
you two go out?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.711
Bowling is not a date.

22:24.711 --> 22:29.849
I mean, we talked about jetting
off to the South Pacific.

22:29.849 --> 22:34.186
Now it's all about
the restaurant

22:34.186 --> 22:36.589
and whose turn it is to
unload the dishwasher.
Okay.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.558
So, you hit a rough patch.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.993
No need to turn
to somebody else.

22:40.993 --> 22:45.832
Dwayne makes me feel alive

22:45.832 --> 22:49.201
and young, like I
did in high school,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.103
I thought he was my true love.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.040
I know, honey, it's hard
for you to understand; I...

22:54.040 --> 22:55.408
No.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.444
Actually, it's not.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.078
Please, honey, just
go find your father.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.914
I don't want him out there
on the road in the snow.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.916
(quietly):
Okay.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.026
TOM:
 Sorry about

23:14.026 --> 23:14.994
the hamster trail.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.129
It started off as a cage
in my bedroom.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.266
(wheel squeaking)
But then I realized
a hamster is no different

23:20.266 --> 23:21.768
than an antelope or a cheetah.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.336
It lives to run, right?

23:24.336 --> 23:26.205
Sure.
Oh, yeah.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.008
Ladies, meet the boys.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.043
Boys, meet the ladies.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.645
(exhales)

23:32.645 --> 23:34.647
See why I called you
to come with me? Scary.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.148
I'm just glad he doesn't
have his mother

23:36.148 --> 23:37.617
sitting in a rocker down here.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.787
I keep a dial-up connection
in case everything goes out

23:40.787 --> 23:42.455
in the middle of
World of Warcraft.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.356
Oh, if somebody named

23:44.356 --> 23:47.393
JarJar8388 pops up, ignore him.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.161
Okay.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.964
Okay, it's all yours.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.067
Okay,

23:55.067 --> 23:57.336
old e-mail account.

23:57.336 --> 23:58.671
Crap!

23:58.671 --> 23:59.972
I forgot my old password.

23:59.972 --> 24:00.807
ZoeHart?

24:00.807 --> 24:01.240
No.

24:01.240 --> 24:01.941
ZoeHart1?

24:01.941 --> 24:02.609
Uh-uh, no.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.610
ZoeHart2?
No.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.343
Favorite pet?

24:04.343 --> 24:05.444
Ooh, MrMittens.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.213
(ding)

24:07.213 --> 24:08.247
No.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.916
ZoeHart3? ZoeHart4?
No.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.751
Stop it... Wait, that's it.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.085
Okay.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.386
E-mail account.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.955
All right, come on.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.595
There's nothing from my dad.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.467
Thanks, Tom.

24:30.537 --> 24:34.674
(computer chimes)
No, not now, JarJar8388!

24:34.674 --> 24:36.375
MAGNOLIA:
We're gonna die.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.677
We're gonna die here.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.978
I mean, it happens
all the time.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.379
People freeze to
death in their cars.

24:40.379 --> 24:43.082
Okay, you know, rarely on
the Gulf Coast of Alabama,

24:43.082 --> 24:45.552
and never on a 20-minute
walk from their own home.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.920
Magnolia, you
just don't seem

24:47.920 --> 24:49.722
very positive about all this.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.958
Why did you even want to
come in the first place?

24:51.958 --> 24:54.426
Because you promised I
could be the maid of honor.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.562
Well, sweetheart, you are.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.496
In a wedding.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.800
I wanted to wear a poofy dress,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.935
to be in all the pictures

25:02.935 --> 25:06.839
right next to you, right up
in front of the whole church!

25:06.839 --> 25:11.010
Everyone in school
was gonna be jealous.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.946
But mostly,

25:13.946 --> 25:17.183
I wanted to be with you
on your wedding day.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.587
To see you all

25:20.587 --> 25:22.188
glowing and crap.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.557
That's what I wanted.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.760
Aw, sweetheart.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.697
I love you, baby.

25:30.697 --> 25:31.998
It'll be good, okay?

25:31.998 --> 25:36.468
(sighs) Okay, so the
gas station's closed,

25:36.468 --> 25:37.737
of course,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.371
because the pumps are broken,

25:39.371 --> 25:42.208
so... no battery.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.910
(car approaches)

25:51.483 --> 25:52.952
Everything all right?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.655
Uh, you know what,
actually, it's not.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.658
We could use a jump.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.496
Mom, it's me.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.032
Listen, something really
weird happened,

26:06.032 --> 26:08.434
I tried to send Dad
something in Germany,

26:08.434 --> 26:10.536
and he's not at his old address.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.138
His phone's been disconnected.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.407
I'm getting worried
that something might've hap...

26:15.407 --> 26:18.611
What do you mean
you ran into him?

26:20.546 --> 26:23.750
He moved back to New York?

26:25.351 --> 26:27.920
Yeah, no, that must've been
an awkward conversation.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.589
Talk to you later, Mom.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.792
(clears throat)

26:34.560 --> 26:35.828
You okay, Dr. Hart?

26:35.828 --> 26:38.230
Huh? Yeah, thanks.
Well, good.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.800
(wry laugh) This town doesn't
need both doctors out of whack.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.669
You know, Doc Breeland came

26:42.669 --> 26:43.870
to see me earlier.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.604
Boy, was he out of it.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.140
Must be the snow.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.142
See you.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.948
(car starts)
All right.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.384
All right,
jumper cables.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.386
Should just about do it.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.758
You going somewhere special?

27:05.758 --> 27:10.096
I mean, you don't really want
to be out on a night like this.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.098
(sighing)

27:14.333 --> 27:16.568
Actually...

27:16.568 --> 27:18.971
George and I are eloping.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.175
Are you?

27:23.175 --> 27:26.846
We're driving to Charleston.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.681
We're getting married
first thing in the morning.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.783
Well, good for you.

27:32.919 --> 27:35.554
You know, that...
night back in December

27:35.554 --> 27:37.589
when I came to your house,

27:37.589 --> 27:40.426
and you wouldn't let me in?

27:40.426 --> 27:44.096
You were right.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.566
I went and told George
about finding my mother,

27:47.566 --> 27:50.269
and he was just...

27:50.269 --> 27:52.471
He was wonderful.

27:52.471 --> 27:55.141
And...

27:55.141 --> 27:57.243
We've never been closer.

27:57.243 --> 28:01.347
(exhales)
I'm glad you're happy.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.355
Well, I wish you all the best.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.662
All right.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.931
Well, Lavon, we cannot
thank you enough.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.366
LEMON:
Yes, thank you.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.168
LAVON:
Drive safe.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.136
Thank you.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.239
For everything.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.079
(truck door closes)

28:46.125 --> 28:47.059
(knocking)

28:47.059 --> 28:48.627
ZOE:
Anybody home?

28:48.627 --> 28:49.829
(knocks)

28:51.397 --> 28:53.499
Hello? Brick?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.167
(groaning)

28:55.167 --> 28:57.036
Brick?

29:00.439 --> 29:01.908
Mama, we need to talk, okay?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.109
Did you find your father?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.276
Yeah. He's with Wade,
getting drunk,

29:04.276 --> 29:06.245
talking about
God knows what.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.980
But you need to end things
with this Dwayne guy.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.116
What? Honey, I thought
you understood.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.151
What I understand
is that in real life,

29:12.151 --> 29:13.886
you don't always
get be with the one

29:13.886 --> 29:15.822
who makes your heart
pound or your knees weak.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.857
Okay? No, real life
is about

29:17.857 --> 29:21.127
being with a person
that you can make a life with.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.362
Someone who's attainable.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.198
Someone you have something
in common with.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.566
Like...

29:27.566 --> 29:28.868
bowling.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.937
True love...

29:32.138 --> 29:33.605
True love is a fantasy.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.374
Even if Dad is not everything

29:35.374 --> 29:37.609
that you thought
you wanted, he's real.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.047
Okay? He's there.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.315
You got to make that work.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.518
(door opens)

29:46.518 --> 29:48.955
Hey, hey, I'm sorry
to interrupt y'all.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.289
Uh, it's Ernie.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.924
There's, uh, a bit
of a situation.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.692
Y'all better come with me.

29:53.692 --> 29:54.894
Now.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.764
Why can't you
just answer?

29:58.764 --> 29:59.932
Where is Ernie?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.367
What the hell
is going on, Wade?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.835
(clears throat)
Oh, I'm not Wade.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.671
I'm your bellhop, Dade.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.875
Ma'am, your suite awaits.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.246
What is all this?

30:27.159 --> 30:30.829
You always wanted
to go to Bora Bora.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.933
Look,

30:33.933 --> 30:37.036
I'm sorry I gave you
that ultimatum

30:37.036 --> 30:39.305
about breaking things
off with Dwayne.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.407
Dwayne wasn't the problem.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.342
I was.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.611
Ernie, I...
No, no, Carolyn,

30:45.611 --> 30:49.148
Our relationship needed
just as much of my attention

30:49.148 --> 30:51.083
and devotion as I gave
to the restaurant

30:51.083 --> 30:53.920
and the Crimson Tide.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.621
I blew it.

30:55.621 --> 30:58.490
Now, I... I'll pick my
socks up off the floor.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.961
I'll even take
ballroom dancing.

31:01.961 --> 31:07.133
Sweetheart, you are
my one true love.

31:07.133 --> 31:11.971
And I will do anything

31:11.971 --> 31:14.440
for a second chance.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.243
It was Fiji.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.878
I always wanted to go to Fiji.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.413
(chuckles)

31:22.848 --> 31:24.416
But this is close enough.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.487
(click)

31:28.487 --> 31:30.489
* *

31:34.393 --> 31:36.028
(whispering):
Dance with her.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.839
That's me.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.476
WADE: Who would
have figured?

31:50.476 --> 31:52.478
I'm a damn cupid.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.022
(door closes)

32:03.855 --> 32:05.091
I-I don't know what happened.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.825
I was... I was...
heading up the upstairs,

32:06.825 --> 32:11.397
and I... oh, I got dizzy,
and-and I... I lost my balance.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.466
Okay. Well, a few hours ago, you
had a significant head injury.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.135
And now you're trying
to climb a ladder?

32:16.135 --> 32:17.603
Seriously, you need to lie down.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.971
No, I... I got to get going.

32:18.971 --> 32:21.207
I got to be
in-in Charleston by 8:00 a.m.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.209
Whoa. Hey,
there. No, no.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.177
You, my friend, are
not going anywhere.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.446
No. Of course I am, 'cause
Lemon and-and George--

32:27.446 --> 32:30.882
they are... they are halfway
to, um-- what-you-ma-call-it?

32:30.882 --> 32:32.351
Yeah, now, South...
South Africa.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.319
Pardon?

32:33.319 --> 32:35.021
Look, I mean
South Carolina.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.922
They are eloping.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.324
Eloping?

32:38.324 --> 32:39.558
Yeah.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.028
As in, getting married
quicker than we thought?

32:42.028 --> 32:44.096
Well, yes, that is
the definition of eloping.

32:44.096 --> 32:48.600
Well, that's...
good for them.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.237
Wait. Brick, you can
barely walk, okay?

32:51.237 --> 32:53.639
You are not driving
to South Carolina

32:53.639 --> 32:55.907
or South Africa or anywhere.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.410
(sighs)

33:02.214 --> 33:05.117
How far is it to
flipping South Carolina?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.252
It is far.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.354
Do you have
to hit every bump?

33:08.354 --> 33:10.656
I mean, I have
such a nasty headache.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.624
Because you probably
have a mild concussion,

33:12.624 --> 33:15.094
which is why we should be
taking you to a hospital.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.962
No!
Seriously, Brick,
I don't get it.

33:16.962 --> 33:18.297
I know Lemon is eloping,

33:18.297 --> 33:20.532
but is it really worth
risking your own health?

33:20.532 --> 33:23.435
I have been waiting
for my little girl's wedding

33:23.435 --> 33:25.271
since she was two weeks old.

33:25.271 --> 33:28.107
I would not miss it
for anything.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.409
When you have kids, you'll see.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.811
All parents feel this way.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.581
Not all parents.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.186
Well, maybe you're right.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.855
But if it's any consolation,

33:43.855 --> 33:46.058
it's his loss.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.641
LEMON:
Sorry, honey.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.144
The restroom of a city park
is not the most convenient place

34:05.144 --> 34:06.945
to put on
a wedding dress, but...

34:06.945 --> 34:09.081
MAGNOLIA:
There was a woman in there,
with the tiniest skirt

34:09.081 --> 34:12.618
and tallest heels I've ever
seen, counting a lot of money.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.952
Whatever job she has,

34:13.952 --> 34:15.154
that's the one I want.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.255
Uh-uh.
Well, you...

34:17.255 --> 34:18.524
both look very beautiful.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.891
Now, as soon as
your dad gets here,

34:20.891 --> 34:23.495
we can get in
and get started.
Well, he's not here yet?

34:23.495 --> 34:25.831
Well, I mean, you don't
want to go through this

34:25.831 --> 34:27.399
without him, do you?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.868
Look, if we have to, we
just... we just reschedule.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.270
MAGNOLIA:
There he is!

34:31.270 --> 34:33.772
Folks, I'm so sorry
this drive took me longer

34:33.772 --> 34:37.309
than I thought,
but I'm here now, okay?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.444
Daddy.
Daddy.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.777
BRICK:
So, let's do it, huh?

34:39.777 --> 34:40.879
Yeah.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.981
Ugh, this place
smells like pee.

34:42.981 --> 34:44.116
LEMON:
Yes, it does.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.451
MAGNOLIA:
I just don't get it.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.585
This is how people want
to get married?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.455
It's gross.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.623
Wait.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.592
I can't...

34:54.693 --> 34:56.695
...do this.
I agree with Magnolia.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.431
What-what are
you saying?
It's just
a funky-smelling courthouse

34:59.431 --> 35:02.701
and a-a judge
we don't even know?

35:04.203 --> 35:05.437
I don't want that.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.073
Lemon, I want a real wedding.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.841
Oh, my God,
you are such a girl.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.009
Magnolia.

35:11.009 --> 35:12.311
You know what? I don't...

35:12.311 --> 35:15.046
I don't care how it sounds,
because I do.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.582
I want a real... wedding.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.717
I want my brother
to be there,

35:18.717 --> 35:21.052
and I want my parents
to be there.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.654
I want my niece
to be the flower girl

35:22.654 --> 35:24.256
like we said
she was gonna be.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.925
Hell, I-I want my...
my bachelor hunting trip.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.560
Come on.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.696
But Lemon,
most importantly,

35:30.696 --> 35:33.332
I don't want to miss out
on the chance

35:33.332 --> 35:38.404
to see the single most beautiful
bride in the world

35:38.404 --> 35:40.339
walking down that aisle
towards me.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.641
(Lemon laughs)

35:42.641 --> 35:44.243
I want a real
wedding, too.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.445
I do. I do.
(laughing)

35:46.445 --> 35:47.913
BRICK
Thank God,

35:47.913 --> 35:49.181
'cause I want
one, too!

35:49.181 --> 35:51.350
I want a really
big washing!

35:51.350 --> 35:52.751
A wedding. Wedding.
What did I say?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.487
A wedding. That's what I
want for my little girl.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.089
You know, and... and
I want some aspirin.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.958
Yeah, of course.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.394
Oh.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.498
(laughing):
Morning, son.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.933
CAROLYN:
Morning, baby.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.167
Hey, hey, you two.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.603
How was, uh, Bora Bora,

36:11.603 --> 36:13.805
or Fiji, or wherever
y'all went?

36:13.805 --> 36:16.107
It was just as you'd
expect the tropics--

36:16.107 --> 36:17.976
hot and steamy.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.678
Mmm.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.680
(kissing sounds)

36:21.680 --> 36:25.050
Okay, yeah, well,
that's, um, um,

36:25.050 --> 36:27.052
all I need to hear.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.255
Wherever we were,
it was divine.

36:29.255 --> 36:32.123
Your father and I...
found the romance again.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.292
That we did.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.726
Mm-hmm.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.395
I'm glad.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.964
Hey, honeymoon suite

36:38.964 --> 36:41.833
also comes with complimentary

36:41.833 --> 36:42.901
brunch.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.670
CAROLYN:
Honey, brunch
sounds wonderful.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.374
Hey, um, listen,
I'll be right back.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.309
I want to say
good-bye to Wade.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.643
(laughter)

36:51.643 --> 36:54.280
CAROLYN:
Lavon, I just wanted
to let you know

36:54.280 --> 36:56.548
that, um, I'm going
to unfriend Dwayne.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.417
Well, I think
that's a good idea.

36:58.417 --> 37:02.954
But son, what you said to me
last night has me worried.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.491
I mean, marriage is hard.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.493
Your father and
I, you know,

37:07.493 --> 37:09.961
fell into the same trap
a lot of people do.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.231
I mean, it's easy to fantasize
about being with someone else.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.302
But that's all it
was, was a fantasy.

37:16.302 --> 37:20.306
Your father and I--
that's the real deal.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.974
Hard as it may be sometimes,

37:22.974 --> 37:25.777
he is my true love.

37:27.145 --> 37:29.147
That's great.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.949
I'm glad
you guys have each other.

37:30.949 --> 37:34.953
All that hullabaloo about
true love being a fantasy

37:34.953 --> 37:39.758
just leads me to believe
you might not be with yours.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.760
Hmm?

37:42.694 --> 37:44.896
(whispers):
Love you, babe.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.856
Oh. Hey.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.758
Uh, I-I can explain.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.494
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.363
I'm too tired to care.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.030
Well, let's
just say, I, uh,

38:19.030 --> 38:21.099
helped get Lavon's
parents back together.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.035
Which they did... in my bed.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.638
Well, no, I wa...
I-I changed the sheets already.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.808
Yeah.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.045
Uh, by the way,

38:34.045 --> 38:39.117
I'm sorry if I'm the reason
that you and Judson broke up.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.388
I shouldn't
have butted in.

38:42.388 --> 38:45.457
I don't know. Everyone's talking
about true love, and...

38:45.457 --> 38:47.626
well, if Judson was
your true love, then...

38:47.626 --> 38:49.395
he'll come back.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.732
For the record,

38:53.732 --> 38:56.935
Judson was not my true love.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.709
Anyway, a package arrived
for you "return to sender."

39:14.019 --> 39:15.821
We made it.

39:15.821 --> 39:20.258
We survived a BlueBell snow day
without any huge disasters.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.461
(laughs)

39:28.166 --> 39:31.169
Didi...

39:31.169 --> 39:34.239
I don't think you and I
should keep seeing each other.

39:34.239 --> 39:37.375
You're kidding, right?

39:37.375 --> 39:40.045
I wanted to-to make
this work, I really did.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.047
I thought I could, but...

39:42.047 --> 39:44.850
I'm just not ready.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.919
I wish you had told me earlier.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.389
I wish I had known.

39:51.389 --> 39:55.761
You are an amazing
woman, Didi Ruano.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.766
I can't thank you enough for
what you did with my parents,

40:00.766 --> 40:02.734
but I have been unfair to you.

40:02.734 --> 40:07.138
I'm sorry. Last thing I ever
wanted to do was hurt you.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.975
It's a little late for that.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.448
See you around, Lavon.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.524
* *

40:31.463 --> 40:32.964
Hi.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.165
Hey.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.366
How was your snow day?

40:35.366 --> 40:37.769
Oh, to sum up:

40:37.769 --> 40:41.707
My parents didn't break up,
Didi and I did,

40:41.707 --> 40:45.110
and I helped Lemon
and George elope.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.145
(laughs)
Yours?

40:47.145 --> 40:50.181
My dad was not kidnapped,

40:50.181 --> 40:53.685
my dad still sucks, and you
didn't help them elope.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.556
They-they didn't do it?

40:59.658 --> 41:01.593
Sorry about Didi.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.795
Um, sorry about your dad.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.331
Hey, on the bright side...

41:06.331 --> 41:09.868
more macaroons for us.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.202
(laughs)

41:13.404 --> 41:14.673
Hey.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.176
So, Lemon and George
really didn't elope?

41:19.377 --> 41:22.113
They're still getting
married, though, you know.

41:22.113 --> 41:23.381
Yeah, I know.

41:23.381 --> 41:25.951
And BlueBell snow day?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.353
Wasn't as bad
as it could've been.

41:28.353 --> 41:29.755
(clears throat)

41:29.755 --> 41:34.259
May we each find our Bora Bora,
wherever it may be.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.495
I know where
Bora Bora is.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.830
It's right near...
Shh.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.865
Oh. Why?

41:39.865 --> 41:41.667
Eat your macaroon.
Hey!

41:41.667 --> 41:45.604
