-We've already covered that,
sir.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.875
-Well, we're going to cover it
again because you can't be
too safe when using a saw.

00:19.917 --> 00:22.166
Like that. Okay?
So, I said I would do that.

00:22.208 --> 00:26.834

we're all on the same page here.

stops when you let it go,

going down to 207A.

bracelets and she won't even
give me one.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.041
Charlie, do you care?
-No?

11:08.083 --> 11:10.709
-Charlie usually cares about
everything.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.917
-It's true.
-[Gerry]: Moving on.

11:12.959 --> 11:17.834
We are going to make lots and
lots of bracelets today.

11:17.875 --> 11:20.208
-I thought we were doing
geography today.

11:20.250 --> 11:24.041

The bracelets are for...

11:24.083 --> 11:27.250
Poor kids...Overseas.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.208
Yeah, overseas, right?

11:29.250 --> 11:32.041
So, the bracelets we're
going to make...This is ah...

11:32.083 --> 11:37.083
This is where they are and we're
going to make the bracelets for
the people over the sea.

11:37.125 --> 11:41.333
That's how we get that. Okay?
So, there's your geography
lesson, alright?

11:41.375 --> 11:45.208
-Sir, my friend's from abroad
and she has a pool in her
backyard.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.166
-A good story from Danika.

11:47.208 --> 11:51.125
But, Danika, first of all,
the word broad, we don't
say that anymore.

11:51.166 --> 11:54.417
That's very ignorant.
Secondly, if you were listening
you would have heard that

11:54.458 --> 11:58.250
we are not making these for your
rich neighbours with a pool.

11:58.291 --> 12:01.500
These are for poor children
to give them something to
smile about.

12:01.542 --> 12:04.333
To give them hope. To give
them a life. Is that good?

12:04.375 --> 12:07.500
We'll make the bracelets now.
-That's all we're doing for
them?

12:07.542 --> 12:11.417

off chopsticks and noodles.

Alright, so, we are going to
make...Let's say...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.959
500 bracelets that say,
"I love Niall".

12:24.000 --> 12:26.333
We'll make 500 that say,
"I love Harry".

you had any pointers.

No.

No, but you know who might
have some advice for you?

-I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

13:53.583 --> 13:58.500
-Yeah, I've got it pretty bad
too. I mean, as it says there
in the official doctor's note.

-Anyway, that's why I need a

have to do is get you looking

-Well...
