00:27.278 --> 00:30.042
<i>Man, you Megawhatts are annoying!</i>

00:38.717 --> 00:42.387
Oh, so annoying.
Blah! Smoothies?

00:42.455 --> 00:45.124
<i>Who'd ever want to drink
something like that?</i>

00:57.277 --> 01:00.576
Fun's over! At least this
time, there's only one of you.

01:01.446 --> 01:06.284
Um... aah!

01:11.591 --> 01:13.123
One.
Two, three, four.

01:14.694 --> 01:16.894
Oh, man!

01:19.932 --> 01:22.200
<i>♪ Ben 10 ♪
♪ he's a kid, and he wants to have fun ♪</i>

01:22.235 --> 01:24.834
<i>♪ but when you need

01:24.870 --> 01:27.336
<i>♪ Ben 10 ♪

01:27.405 --> 01:29.670

<i>♪ Ben 10 ♪</i>

01:44.750 --> 01:46.649
Great.
And, of course, I don't have

01:46.685 --> 01:49.419
anything that can handle electricity.

01:49.455 --> 01:52.222
Oh, wait. Yeah, I do!

02:03.168 --> 02:06.135
Totally forgot about Feedback.

02:08.572 --> 02:12.973
Let's see you laugh
without any energy!

02:30.591 --> 02:31.857
Oh, yeah!

02:31.892 --> 02:33.960
Because nobody ...
and I mean nobody ...

02:34.260 --> 02:37.999
makes a fool out of Ben 10!

02:40.034 --> 02:43.235
It's a good thing Ben
still needs his rubber sheets.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.805
These should make for good
insulation.

02:47.575 --> 02:50.910
Don't go there, Gwen.

02:59.416 --> 03:00.886
Sorry I'm late.

03:00.921 --> 03:03.622
You're not on your own
schedule anymore, Ben.

03:03.690 --> 03:05.891
You can't keep your partner
waiting.

03:05.926 --> 03:10.095
I was...
off saving the universe.

03:15.235 --> 03:16.835
Come on, Rook, let's go.

03:16.904 --> 03:20.640
- I'm parked over here.
- We'll take mine.

03:26.981 --> 03:28.714
Wow.
I bet the girls all start

03:28.750 --> 03:31.650
screaming when they see this
ride rolling down the block.

03:31.719 --> 03:36.989
Females are not afraid of my
vehicle, but they probably should be.

03:44.931 --> 03:49.216
Sometimes you're
actually kind of awesome.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.804
Sometimes.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.395
I'm not familiar with
human emotional cues,

04:14.695 --> 04:18.599
- but are you angry at me?
- Nah, just bored.

04:23.706 --> 04:26.406
<i>Over here on your left, you'll
see what we call water.</i>

04:26.475 --> 04:27.674
<i>Careful, it's wet.</i>

04:27.743 --> 04:30.477
Water is wet.
I'm familiar with that.

04:30.512 --> 04:33.046
I'm sorry that I left
you waiting around.

04:33.115 --> 04:35.315
I just don't want to change how I work.

04:35.384 --> 04:38.418
I've saved the universe a
million times ... at least!

04:38.487 --> 04:40.953
That is why I look
forward to this.

04:41.022 --> 04:43.956
I hope the real Ben Tennyson
lives up to the legends.

04:44.025 --> 04:47.593
There are legends?!

04:47.629 --> 04:51.497
They can't all be true, though.
For instance, Alien X ...

04:51.533 --> 04:54.800
That's just a rumor that a fan made
up and put on the extranet, right?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.236
Alien X is real.

04:57.304 --> 05:01.307
He is? Show me.
Change into Alien X right now.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.242
I'd better not.
It's a whole thing.

05:05.078 --> 05:08.413
- Just as I thought.
- Look, find us a little

05:08.448 --> 05:12.417
heroing to do, and you can tell
me if I live up to the legend.

06:24.793 --> 06:27.829
<i>Some heroing so far.</i>

06:27.897 --> 06:32.900
At least the world is safe from
car-munching aliens.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.937
Look, some normal dude.

06:36.005 --> 06:38.205
Maybe we should arrest
him for jaywalking.

06:38.274 --> 06:42.276
His phone shouldn't be
able to be powered here on Earth.

06:42.311 --> 06:50.383
- Is that normal?
- No, that's not normal.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.454
Well, you tell her that I'm
part of something big.

06:54.489 --> 06:55.855
I'll call you back.

07:02.697 --> 07:05.233
You're welcome.

07:11.338 --> 07:14.306
Finally, some action.

07:14.375 --> 07:19.311
Big chill will let me cut right
through these buildings.

07:19.346 --> 07:24.683
Heatblast. Seriously?

07:24.751 --> 07:26.685
Time to improvise.

08:03.224 --> 08:05.725
Aw, this one's gonna
sting a little!

08:18.439 --> 08:21.073
- What is your deal?!
- I wasn't doing anything!

08:21.108 --> 08:26.411
- Except shooting at a plumber.
- And a superhero.

08:26.446 --> 08:29.614
Alien communicator, alien weapon.
Please tell me you work for

08:29.650 --> 08:32.150
someone big and dangerous
so I can kick his butt.

08:32.186 --> 08:35.788
You guys wouldn't last a
minute against my boss.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.059
This doesn't sound like
a typical Earth combustion engine.

08:40.095 --> 08:43.929
- Maybe it's a hybrid.
- There's nothing in there, I swear!

09:05.188 --> 09:07.588
Megawhatts?

09:16.824 --> 09:23.929
Megawhatts? I haven't
seen any of these guys in years.

09:28.436 --> 09:31.203
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:31.239 --> 09:32.571
Stop ... Ow!
... that!

09:32.640 --> 09:36.843
I've never faced
a Nosedeenian. Any advice?

09:36.878 --> 09:37.911
Ow!

09:42.351 --> 09:44.718
Try not to let them zap you.

09:50.492 --> 09:52.360
Duly noted.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.766
Stop them!

10:13.479 --> 10:16.181
Which way?

10:19.252 --> 10:22.587
I'll keep after them.
Give me some eyes in the sky.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.403
They seem to be moving
towards the water-port.

10:38.471 --> 10:43.007
They can outrun me, but
they can't outrun XLR8.

10:44.243 --> 10:45.943
It's hero time!

10:47.380 --> 10:52.884
Clockwork?
This is ridiculous!

11:13.170 --> 11:15.137
I lost them.

11:15.206 --> 11:19.609
They're too far ahead of...
wait, what?!

11:20.745 --> 11:23.880
<i>Na, na, na-na, na!</i>

11:43.503 --> 11:47.338
Are you hurt, Ben?

11:47.374 --> 11:50.441
Give me a sec so I don't hurl.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.979
It's a miracle they
didn't escape a Chronosapien.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.916
That's the thing.
I think they want me to follow them.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.185
Do you need more time?

12:00.254 --> 12:05.891
No. But if you see my
face turning green, step back.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.276
I see it, but I don't
believe it.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.911
The Megawhatts need our help.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.082
Someone has set up a factory
that uses them as a power source.

12:35.187 --> 12:38.655
Hey, two of the batteries got out!

12:51.838 --> 12:54.672
Better do something
soon, if you know what I mean.

12:54.708 --> 12:55.473
I do.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.950
Great.

13:10.090 --> 13:14.027
You better be worth
interrupting my workout for.

13:14.096 --> 13:16.463
Looks like spies, Fistrick.

13:18.634 --> 13:21.835
We got spies in my house of
business?

13:22.571 --> 13:24.471
There's no sign out front.

13:24.506 --> 13:27.874
Seems like you don't want people
to know your business.

13:30.078 --> 13:33.446
Well... this kind of alien tech
doesn't just fall off a truck.

13:33.515 --> 13:36.249
I'm sure whoever you
took it from isn't too happy

13:36.284 --> 13:37.450
about it going missing.

13:40.922 --> 13:44.156
He don't care anymore... bro.

13:44.192 --> 13:48.461
You steal alien tech and
then use alien hostages to charge it.

13:48.496 --> 13:51.898
One alien makes it.
Another alien powers it.

13:51.933 --> 13:55.068
I mass-produce it and sell it to
the highest bidder.

13:55.103 --> 13:58.271
It's just good business, bro.

13:59.574 --> 14:00.473
What is that?

14:00.509 --> 14:03.177
An electron
entanglement disrupter.

14:11.554 --> 14:12.820
Yeah!

14:35.144 --> 14:38.980
Oh, you just
made a big mistake, bro.

14:39.315 --> 14:41.315
I make a lot of mistakes.

14:41.384 --> 14:45.452
Shutting you down
isn't one of them.

15:10.725 --> 15:16.563
You never asked why we needed so
many of these Nosedeenians.

15:20.570 --> 15:24.004
Let's take this
baby for a test-drive.

15:28.042 --> 15:31.278
Looks like I'm getting my
workout after all.

15:41.495 --> 15:43.663
A class 12
armored mecha suit.

15:43.698 --> 15:47.033
- Have you ever dealt with one before?
- No. How do you beat it?

15:47.068 --> 15:49.702
Me?
You could try Alien X.

15:49.737 --> 15:52.237
Stop it.
Huh?

16:02.984 --> 16:06.854
Whoa! I love it!

16:13.663 --> 16:16.297
Stop shooting!
You might hit the Megawhatts!

16:16.366 --> 16:20.369
If we can't fight back, that
does tend to make our job more difficult.

16:20.404 --> 16:21.670
Oh, we can fight.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.306
We just have to take him
down without hurting them.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.107
That won't be easy.

16:26.143 --> 16:29.379
It never is.
Huh?

16:31.414 --> 16:34.849
Okay, Omnitrix, no messing around.
I want four arms.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.651
Do you hear me?
Four arms.

16:36.687 --> 16:39.120
I don't want grey matter.
I don't want nano mech.

16:39.189 --> 16:41.322
Four arms!

16:51.902 --> 16:53.401
Who's this?!

16:53.470 --> 16:56.404
You can
presto-chango all you want.

16:56.440 --> 17:00.108
I'm still gonna squash you like a bug!

17:00.143 --> 17:02.510
Ohh! Ohh!

17:12.556 --> 17:15.156
Ohh!

17:17.762 --> 17:22.866
Gravity powers?
Nice!

17:32.845 --> 17:34.245
Yeah, Rook!

17:35.515 --> 17:39.450
Focus your gravitational field lower!

17:39.486 --> 17:42.687
Sorry, man!

17:48.528 --> 17:49.794
Oh, dear.

17:51.731 --> 17:55.332
Rook!
You okay?!

17:55.368 --> 17:57.501
Rook, come on, partner.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.273
You...

18:04.309 --> 18:06.609
want...
some...

18:06.644 --> 18:08.511
more...
bro?!

18:08.546 --> 18:11.914
Not... really!

18:12.350 --> 18:14.817
Too bad about your friend.

18:14.852 --> 18:19.522
Too bad for you
that he got off easy.

18:19.558 --> 18:23.827
Ohh!
Aah!

18:26.097 --> 18:27.931
You're welcome.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.738
Weak!

18:35.807 --> 18:38.974
Ben, I think I can
separate the Megawhatts from the

18:39.010 --> 18:41.210
suit, but it will be a difficult shot.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.345
Try to get the suit to stop moving.

18:43.381 --> 18:49.086
Yeah, thanks, Rook.
I'll get right on that.

18:58.196 --> 19:00.280
Got anything else, hero,

19:00.580 --> 19:02.665
or are you just a one-trick pony?

19:02.700 --> 19:06.002
Hey, it's my first
time using this guy.

19:06.037 --> 19:09.105
Now, you might be able to
withstand 40 G's.

19:12.778 --> 19:17.414
But I don't think the docks can.
What do you think?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.388
This is like one of those dunk tanks!

19:24.423 --> 19:26.957
Are you having as much fun as I am?

19:28.694 --> 19:32.295
I got it to stop moving.

19:47.714 --> 19:51.583
Nice shot!

19:51.618 --> 19:54.785
<i>Power level critical.
12% remaining.</i>

19:54.821 --> 19:57.021
Just enough.

20:01.093 --> 20:03.794
Huh?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.109
I have my own orbit?

20:12.409 --> 20:17.073
That is pretty cool.
I wonder...

20:17.109 --> 20:21.344
Oh, this is not good.

20:44.367 --> 20:46.335
I think you've had enough.

20:48.370 --> 20:49.905
Bro.

20:49.941 --> 20:54.277
- That was not easy.
- It never is.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.524
I hear there's a colony

21:07.560 --> 21:10.193
of Megawhatts that
helps power undertown.

21:10.228 --> 21:13.796
- Since when?
- Since now.

21:20.504 --> 21:23.205
- Anytime, guys.
- The Tennyson legends

21:23.240 --> 21:25.741
usually end with some
kind of blended beverage.

21:25.776 --> 21:29.345
Smoothies?
Oh, they're more of a daytime thing.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.747
At night, it's chili fries.

21:31.816 --> 21:35.017
Okay.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.553
<i>And, by the way, Alien X is real.</i>

21:37.589 --> 21:39.188
<i>Why can't I see it?</i>

21:39.223 --> 21:44.360
<i>Dude, there are some things
you're just gonna have to trust me on.</i>
