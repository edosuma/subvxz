A BETTER DOCTOR FOR IT.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.533
I'M LONELY, DEREK.

00:46.233 --> 00:50.567
* ON AN OPEN FIRE...

00:50.600 --> 00:52.267
EXPERTS THINK IT'S BECAUSE

00:52.300 --> 00:54.567
PEOPLE ARE LESS INCLINED
TO OFF THEMSELVES

00:54.600 --> 00:56.367
WHEN SURROUNDED BY FAMILY.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.767

01:10.667 --> 01:13.533
OH, I KNOW. I KNOW SOMETIMES
I CAN GO A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.233
NO, IT'S GREAT.
NO, WE LOVE IT.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.667

01:20.067 --> 01:21.567
THAT SAME FAMILY TOGETHERNESS

01:21.600 --> 01:24.200
IS THOUGHT TO BE THE REASON
THAT DEPRESSION RATES

01:24.233 --> 01:26.400

AT THE HOLIDAYS.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.300

02:08.800 --> 02:10.800
(telephone rings)

02:10.833 --> 02:12.333
LOOK AT HER BELLY.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.300
SHE'S ALMOST AS WIDE
AS SHE IS TALL.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.067
ARE HER ANKLES SWOLLEN?
IS THAT WHY SHE'S WADDLING?

02:17.100 --> 02:18.733
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US
WHEN SHE GOES ON LEAVE?

02:18.767 --> 02:20.100
(Cristina) LEAVE?
SHE'S GOING ON LEAVE?

02:20.133 --> 02:21.633
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS

02:21.667 --> 02:23.500
WHEN PEOPLE PUSH BABIES
OUT OF THEIR VAGINAS?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.167
DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA GET
A NEW RESIDENT?

02:25.200 --> 02:27.500
NAH, THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST LET
US ALL WANDER AROUND UNATTENDED

02:27.533 --> 02:29.067
TO SEE HOW MUCH DAMAGE
WE CAN DO.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.533
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WOULD KNOW.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.800
HEY, YOU GUYS,
WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER

02:32.833 --> 02:35.300
AND GET BAILEY A CHRISTMAS GIFT
FOR THE BABY,

02:35.333 --> 02:37.300

03:11.600 --> 03:13.567
I WAS STRINGING
HANNUMAS LIGHTS,

03:13.600 --> 03:15.167
AND A SHINGLE CAME LOOSE.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.267
HANNUMAS?

03:16.300 --> 03:19.333
HANNUMAS, CHRISMUKKAH.
WE GO ALL OUT.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.333
AWESOME.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.300
HE FELL 12 FEET.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.133
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
MY HEAD BROKE MY FALL.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.633
UH, THERE ARE
NO VISIBLE DEFORMITIES,

03:27.667 --> 03:30.333
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY HAVING
SOME FOCAL LEFT ARM WEAKNESS.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.767
HE'LL PROBABLY BE FINE. HE'S
ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE HARDHEADED.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.600
(Girl)
* DREIDEL, DREIDEL, DREIDEL

03:34.633 --> 03:36.367
DOES YOUR HEAD HURT
WHEN YOU LAUGH?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.300
IS THAT A BAD THING?

03:38.333 --> 03:42.067
FOLLOW MY FINGER
WITH YOUR EYES, PLEASE.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.300
I KNOW KARATE.

03:43.333 --> 03:47.100

YOU KNOW WHAT? YOUR HUSBAND
MIGHT NEED A LITTLE QUIET,

03:49.267 --> 03:51.133
SO THERE'S A CAFETERIA
RIGHT DOWN--

03:51.167 --> 03:52.833
NO, NO, LET 'EM STAY.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.233

WE'RE VERY, VERY SORRY
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.100
INCONVENIENCE?

04:22.133 --> 04:23.567
YOU WATCH YOUR CHILD
SPEND THREE DAYS IN PAIN,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.567
AND THEN COME AND TALK TO ME
ABOUT INCONVENIENCE.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.667
WE GET A LOT OF TRAUMA CASES
AT THE HOLIDAYS.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.333

07:12.100 --> 07:13.233
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE NOT
IN SURGERY,

07:13.267 --> 07:15.167
AND SHE SAID TO TELL YOU,

07:15.200 --> 07:18.500
"WE ARE GOING TO OUR NIECE'S
SCHOOL PAGEANT THIS MORNING.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.567

"AND AFTER WHAT YOU PULLED
ON THANKSGIVING..."

07:22.533 --> 07:24.233
AND THEN SHE STARTED USING
A GREAT MANY WORDS

07:24.267 --> 07:27.400
THAT I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE REPEATING.
LOOK, I HAVE SEVEN SURGEONS
ON VACATION.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.567
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT DIVORCE.

YES, SIR.

07:36.867 --> 07:39.267
THE WOMAN IS UNREASONABLE.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.200
WHEN DID WATCHING
A 6-YEAR-OLD DRESSED UP

REPORTED EXTREME PAIN
WHEN WE FOUND HIM.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.067
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT FRUITCAKE.
HE MUST HAVE TORN HIS ABDOMEN
WIDE OPEN.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.233
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT ME
FOR THIS ONE.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.367

08:04.167 --> 08:06.600
IT SAYS, "DON'T HATE ME
FOR HURTING YOUR SON,"

08:06.633 --> 08:07.833
EXCEPT WITH FABRIC.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.767
ADDIE, YOU KNOW
MY MOM LOVES YOU.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.433
NO, SHE USED TO LOVE ME.

08:11.467 --> 08:14.333
I'VE GOT A LOT OF GROUND
TO MAKE UP FOR WITH THESE GIFTS.

08:14.367 --> 08:17.267
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK--
PLAIN OR PLAID OR BOTH?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW?

08:17.300 --> 08:19.200

08:32.267 --> 08:33.833
IT'S NOT GREAT.

08:33.867 --> 08:36.400
OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD
AT ALL.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.367
HONEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS SCOOTER?

08:38.400 --> 08:41.767
EXCUSE ME, I NEED TO TAKE
HER BLOOD PRESSURE.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.067
(All shouting over each other)

08:45.100 --> 08:46.800
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE SURGERY?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.167
APART FROM WHEN YOU'RE
ACTUALLY GONNA DO IT?

08:49.200 --> 08:51.567
WE'RE DOING IT NOW.
GOOD.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.567
I'M SORRY.
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.500
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

08:55.533 --> 08:56.600
NO.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.300
I'VE HAD THREE BLEEDING ULCERS
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

08:59.333 --> 09:02.533
YEAH. I HOPE YOU READ
THE CHART.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.100
YES.
GOOD.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.700
DR. BAILEY, A GASTRIC
PERFORATION JUST CAME IN.

09:13.733 --> 09:16.500
DAMN. UH, ALL RIGHT.

09:16.533 --> 09:19.500
TAKE MRS. SHELTON
BACK TO HER ROOM.
SERIOUSLY?

09:19.533 --> 09:20.600
DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M KIDDING?

09:20.633 --> 09:22.667
TELL HER WE'LL GET TO HER
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:22.700 --> 09:26.167
GREY, CALL THE E.R. TELL THEM TO
SEND HIM UP, AND THEN SCRUB IN.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.133
ALEX KAREV, UM,
FAILED HIS BOARDS,

09:30.167 --> 09:32.133
AND HE'S RETAKING THEM
TOMORROW.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.100
HE CAN'T STUDY FOR A PRACTICAL
BY HIMSELF.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.133
IF HE FAILS AGAIN,
HE'S OUT.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.067
OKAY, GO.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.067
O'MALLEY.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.567
Yeah?

09:40.600 --> 09:43.667
AFTER YOU DROP HER OFF,
GET BACK HERE AND SCRUB IN.
All right.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.367
OKAY.
(Woman) OKAY, JUSTIN--

09:45.400 --> 09:46.567
I TOLD YOU,

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
I DON'T WANT THE HEART.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

09:48.633 --> 09:51.133
'CAUSE YOU NEED IT,
AND UNTIL YOU'RE 18,

09:51.167 --> 09:53.067
YOUR MOTHER
CALLS ALL THE SHOTS.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.833
MY MOTHER'S A LIAR.
YOU HEARD HER.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.833
SHE SAID THE HEART
CAME FROM SANTA CLAUS.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.767
SHE SHOULDN'T GET
TO DECIDE ANYTHING.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.533
YEAH, WELL,
YOU COULD MAKE A RUN FOR IT,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.500
BUT THE HEART YOU HAVE
WON'T GET YOU VERY FAR.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.400
ARE WE READY?
JUST ABOUT.

10:06.433 --> 10:10.400
HOW ABOUT YOU, BUDDY?
ARE YOU READY?

10:10.433 --> 10:12.333
IF I DIE IN THE SURGERY,

10:12.367 --> 10:14.800
CAN YOU GIVE THIS HEART
TO SOME OTHER KID?

10:14.833 --> 10:17.767
NOT GONNA HAPPEN, JUSTIN,
NOT ON MY WATCH.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.200
HERE WE GO.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.667
AND IT WAS ONLY ONE DAY
OF OIL.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

10:26.700 --> 10:30.433
IT LASTED EIGHT
WHOLE DAYS AND NIGHTS.
AND IT WAS A MIRACLE.

10:30.467 --> 10:33.533
I WANTED TO SAY THAT PART.
MR. EPSTEIN,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.800
YOU REMEMBER DR. SHEPHERD?

10:35.833 --> 10:37.767
UM, SHOULD WE TALK
MORE PRIVATELY?

10:37.800 --> 10:40.667
NO, JUST TELL US.
IS IT BAD?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.600
THE FALL HAS CAUSED
A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.633
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:44.667 --> 10:47.500
THAT MEANS YOUR DAD--
HIS BRAIN IS BLEEDING.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.500
GREAT.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.600
LOOK, THERE ARE SOME RISKS
TO THIS SURGERY.

10:52.633 --> 10:55.267
IT HAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE
THE BLEEDING GETS WORSE.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.633
WHAT KIND OF RISKS?

10:56.667 --> 10:59.233
SEE, THE BLEED IS, UH,
IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN

10:59.267 --> 11:01.400
THAT CONTROLS THE SPEECH
AND THE MOTOR CONTROL.

11:01.433 --> 11:04.067
WE DON'T NEED AN OPERATION,
OKAY?

11:04.067 --> 11:06.533
(Tim) YOU KNOW, JAKE,
I THINK WE DO.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.067
HEY, HONEY,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE?

11:09.067 --> 11:10.100
WHAT?

11:10.133 --> 11:12.067
WE HAVE A DOCTOR
NAMED SHEPHERD.

11:12.067 --> 11:16.767
SHEPHERD. IS THAT A SIGN
FROM GOD OR WHAT?

11:24.433 --> 11:26.200
LOOK AT THAT.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.700
BEAUTIFUL FIT.

11:29.733 --> 11:32.600
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S SO ANGRY.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.500
IF I HAD THAT MOTHER,
I'D BE ANGRY, TOO.

11:34.533 --> 11:36.433
ACTUALLY,
I DO HAVE THAT MOTHER.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.333
WELL, HIS MOTHER IS NOT
THE PROBLEM HERE.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.200
SHE LOVES HIM.
SHE NEVER LEAVES.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.533
SHE ALSO NEVER LISTENS.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HIM.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.067
JUSTIN IS DEPRESSED.
YOU HEARD HIM.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.200
HE DOESN'T WANNA LIVE.

11:47.233 --> 11:50.200
I JUST HOPE HE CHANGES HIS MIND
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.100
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TOO LATE?

11:52.133 --> 11:54.667
WITH ALL MEDICAL REALITIES
BEING EQUAL,

11:54.700 --> 11:56.600
WHY DOES ONE PATIENT LIVE

11:56.633 --> 11:58.500
AND ANOTHER DIES?

11:58.533 --> 12:01.667
I BELIEVE THERE'S
A MIND/BODY/SPIRIT CONNECTION,

12:01.700 --> 12:05.233
AND IF JUSTIN REALLY
DOESN'T WANT THIS HEART,

12:05.267 --> 12:07.500
HIS BODY WILL REJECT IT.

12:07.533 --> 12:10.700
OKAY, LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

12:10.733 --> 12:12.733
YOU DON'T JUST
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS--

12:12.767 --> 12:15.600
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
IN SANTA CLAUS?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.467
DR. YANG, GO AND SCHEDULE
A PSYCHIATRIC CONSULT

12:23.500 --> 12:25.200
FOR OUR PATIENT.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.167
WE'RE--WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.100
YOU ARE.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.100
I DON'T KNOW.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.067
IT HURTS HERE AND HERE
AND BACK HERE.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.700
ANY CHANCE YOU GOT HIT BY
A TRUCK AND FORGOT ABOUT IT?

12:43.733 --> 12:45.767
YOU'RE JUDGED ON BEDSIDE MANNER,
ALEX. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

12:45.800 --> 12:47.633
IF THAT'S WHY YOU FAILED
THE LAST TIME.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.300
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE PATRONIZING?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.200
I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR HELP.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.700
ENOUGH WITH THE EGO,
YOU BIG BABY.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.467
I GAVE UP A SURGERY
FOR THIS.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.767
NOW LIKE I SAID,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.433
IT HURTS HERE AND HERE
AND BACK HERE.

12:59.467 --> 13:00.800
OH, AND THIS MORNING,

13:00.833 --> 13:04.600
I NOTICED MY POOP
WAS A FUNNY GRAYISH COLOR.

13:04.633 --> 13:07.200
WOW. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAVE
OF HIS STOMACH?

13:07.233 --> 13:09.667
YEP. IF EATING IS WHAT
THIS MAN LIVES FOR,

13:09.700 --> 13:11.600
WE SHOULD PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MISERY.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.267
PAGING DR. KAREVIAN.
(laughter)

13:13.300 --> 13:15.667
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

13:15.700 --> 13:18.067
JUST... IT'S A JOKE.

13:18.067 --> 13:21.067
KEVORKIAN, KAREVIAN?
ALEX KAREV?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.633
I GET THE JOKE. I JUST
DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.800
YOU SEE THIS, O'MALLEY?

13:25.833 --> 13:27.700
I MAKE ONE MISTAKE
WITH THIS SCALPEL,

13:27.733 --> 13:29.500
AND THIS MAN'S DEAD.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.700
MY HUSBAND--

13:30.733 --> 13:33.367
HE MAKES MISTAKES
AT HIS JOB ALL THE TIME.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.500
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
HE'S NEVER KILLED ANYONE,

13:35.533 --> 13:39.167
BUT I HAVE, AND YOU WILL,
AND ALEX DID.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.067
HE MADE A MATH MISTAKE,
AND A MAN DIED FOR IT.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.233
YOU RUN THAT PAST
YOUR ACCOUNTANT,

13:44.267 --> 13:46.700
SEE HOW HE'D FEEL
IF EVERY MISTAKE HE MADE,

13:46.733 --> 13:49.200
SOMEONE ENDED UP DEAD.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.533
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LIKE ALEX.

13:51.567 --> 13:53.067
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CARE ABOUT HIM.

13:53.067 --> 13:56.300
BUT YOU DAMN WELL
HAVE TO BE ON HIS SIDE.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.633
HOLD THAT.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.467
(whirring)

14:01.500 --> 14:04.233
(Izzie) WHAT A GREAT FAMILY.
HANNUMAS. CHRISMUKKAH.

14:04.267 --> 14:06.067
AND HOW CUTE ARE THOSE KIDS?

14:06.100 --> 14:09.067
REALLY, DR. STEVENS?
CHRISMUKKAH?

14:10.867 --> 14:14.433
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.167
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT TIME OF YEAR

14:16.200 --> 14:18.100
NEUROSURGEONS ARE THE BUSIEST,
DR. STEVENS?

14:18.133 --> 14:21.367
NO, THERE'S A TIME OF YEAR?
WELL, THERE'S NO
HARD OR FAST RULE,

14:21.400 --> 14:23.733
BUT BRAIN INJURIES TEND
TO PILE UP AROUND THE HOLIDAYS,

14:23.767 --> 14:26.067
LIKE OUR FRIEND HERE.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.267
FOLKS FALL OFF THEIR ROOFS
WHILE THEY STRING UP LIGHTS,

14:28.300 --> 14:31.167
OR THEY GO SKATING FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE

14:31.200 --> 14:32.633
AND BREAK THEIR HEADS OPEN.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.667
AND EVERY YEAR,
PEOPLE DRIVE THROUGH BLIZZARDS

14:35.700 --> 14:38.533
TO GET TO PARTIES WHERE THEY
KISS GERM-INFECTED STRANGERS

14:38.567 --> 14:40.067
UNDER POISONOUS MISTLETOE,

14:40.100 --> 14:42.800
AND THEN THEY GET SO DRUNK
THAT THEY SMASH THEIR HEADS

14:42.833 --> 14:45.200
THROUGH THEIR WINDSHIELD
ON THEIR WAY HOME.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.400
LIKE I SAID,

14:46.433 --> 14:50.567
THERE'S NO
HARD OR FAST RULE.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.500
DOES THIS HURT, MRS. GREY?

14:52.533 --> 14:53.300
YES, DOCTOR.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.367
HOW ABOUT HERE?
DOES IT HURT HERE?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.700
YES, IT DOES.

14:56.733 --> 14:58.633
OKAY, SERIOUSLY,
IF YOU'RE THAT LONELY,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.767
THERE ARE EXCELLENT VIBRATORS.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.267
I CAN GIVE YOU A CATALOG.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.667
HE FAILED HIS BOARDS.
I'M HELPING HIM STUDY.
YOU FAILED YOUR PRACTICAL?

15:04.700 --> 15:06.733
GLAD TO KNOW
YOU KEEP A SECRET, GREY.

15:06.767 --> 15:10.133
I KEPT YOUR SECRET. IT DIDN'T DO
YOU ANY GOOD. HE NEEDS OUR HELP.
OH, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.067
WHAT IF THAT WERE YOU?
(pager beeps)

15:12.100 --> 15:13.367
IT WOULDN'T BE.
WELL, WHAT IF IT WERE?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.833
IT WOULDN'T BE.
I HAVE TO GO.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.700
BE A PATIENT.
DO IT FOR ME.
FINE, BUT WHEN TINY TIM

15:18.733 --> 15:20.633
GOES ALL NORMAN BATES ON US,
I'M BLAMING YOU.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.100
DIAGNOSIS?
GALLSTONES.

15:22.133 --> 15:23.700
YES.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.300
(sighs) I'M A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.233
I'M NAUSEOUS
AND I CAN'T STOP THROWING UP.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.533
FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT? I DIDN'T
ASK FOR ANYBODY'S HELP.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.600
OKAY, EVIL SPAWN,
YOU CAN NURSE YOUR PRIDE,

15:33.633 --> 15:36.267
LIKE YOU WERE BEING A NURSE,
OR YOU CAN PASS YOUR TEST

15:36.300 --> 15:38.233
AND BE A DOCTOR. UP TO YOU.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.233
ANY ABDOMINAL PAIN?

15:43.267 --> 15:47.100
YES, FROM MY GIANT, FAT BELLY
ALL THE WAY TO MY BACK.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.433
OH, AND I'M DRUNK.
HICCUP, HICCUP.

15:49.467 --> 15:52.700
I GOT ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.

15:52.733 --> 15:56.100
HE TRIED TO GIFT WRAP
A 70-INCH TV FOR HIS WIFE?

15:56.133 --> 15:57.067
HERNIA?

15:57.100 --> 15:58.600
STRANGULATED. PRETTY UGLY.

15:58.633 --> 16:01.233
WELL, YOU JUST KNOW
THE WIFE HATES TV.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.200
GREY, IS THAT OTHER PROJECT
COVERED?
I THINK SO.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.567
THEN SCRUB IN.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.500
O'MALLEY, GO TELL NADIA SHELTON

16:06.533 --> 16:10.367
SHE'S OFF THE SCHEDULE
TILL TOMORROW.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.067
TILL TOMORROW?
ANOTHER DAY'S NOT GONNA
KILL ME, JIMMY.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.567
I PROMISE TOMORROW
FOR SURE.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.233
TODAY WAS FOR SURE.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.433
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

16:17.467 --> 16:19.367
HE'S SAYING THEY CAN'T
OPERATE TILL TOMORROW!

16:19.400 --> 16:20.433
OUTRAGEOUS!

16:20.467 --> 16:22.733
(Woman) I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!
OW.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.833
CAN YOU PLEASE--COULD YOU
PLEASE TURN THAT DOWN?

16:24.867 --> 16:28.133
YOUR MOTHER NEEDS TO REST.
WHO ARE YOU, MY DAD?

16:28.167 --> 16:31.067
SIR, COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL YOUR SON--
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT MY SON.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.833
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

16:32.867 --> 16:35.400
I'M REALLY SORRY. I THINK THAT
YOUR WIFE SHOULD REST.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.500
I'M LISTENING HERE!
I CAN'T GO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

16:37.533 --> 16:40.433
YOU PEOPLE HAVE RUINED
EVERYTHING.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.467
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.367
(sobbing)
I'M VERY SORRY.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.700
YEAH. YEAH.

16:46.733 --> 16:50.600
"I'M VERY SORRY." THAT CUTS
IT HERE, DOC. THANKS A LOT.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.333
(sobbing loudly)

16:53.767 --> 16:56.733
YEAH, OKAY, YOU'RE REALLY
GRABBING ME NOW. THAT'S ASSAULT.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.300
THIS...

16:59.333 --> 17:02.200
IS AN EXAM PAT.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.267
WHAT...

17:03.300 --> 17:05.467
WHAT THE HELL?
DOES IZZIE KNOW?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.133
DOES BURKE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

17:07.167 --> 17:11.067
UNBUNCH YOUR PANTIES, GEORGE.
WE'RE HELPING ALEX STUDY. DO IT.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.667
I CAN'T HEAR YOU WHEN HIS HAND
IS ON YOUR BOOB.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.567
TAKE YOUR HAND
OFF MY BOOB, ALEX.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.533
THANK YOU.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.067
STUDY FOR WHAT?

17:19.100 --> 17:21.500
SHUT IT, YANG.
ALEX FAILED HIS BOARDS.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.800
SERIOUSLY?
I FAILED ONE PART OF ONE BOARD.
THAT'S IT.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.767
STILL,
THAT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.633
(pager beeps)

17:27.667 --> 17:32.167
EH! HE'S ALL YOURS, GEORGIE.
DO YOUR WORST.

17:34.467 --> 17:38.533
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME A RECTAL.
DO NOT ASK ME TO COUGH.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.767
(Woman over P.A.)
DR. COHEN TO RADIOLOGY.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.133
DR. COHEN TO RADIOLOGY.

17:41.167 --> 17:44.500
YOU PAGE ME?

17:44.533 --> 17:46.767
I DIDN'T SEE A PSYCH CONSULT
SCHEDULED HERE.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.300
I COULDN'T GET ONE.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.400
I TRIED TO, BUT THEY TOLD ME
TO COME BACK IN JANUARY.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.800
YOU DISRESPECTED ME.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.633
YOU MOCKED ME IN MY O.R.
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

17:57.667 --> 17:58.700
I...

17:58.733 --> 17:59.867
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.233
YOU EQUATED MY SPIRITUALITY
WITH A BELIEF IN SANTA CLAUS.

18:03.267 --> 18:06.067
BURKE, SCIENCE IS
THE ONE THING, YOU KNOW?

18:06.100 --> 18:08.533
IT'S THE ONE THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.400
I'M AN INTERN.
YOU'RE NOT.

18:10.433 --> 18:13.167
I'M A SLOB,
AND YOU'RE NOT.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.067
I SAY I WANNA KEEP
OUR RELATIONSHIP PRIVATE,

18:16.067 --> 18:17.533
AND YOU GO AND TELL
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY

18:17.567 --> 18:19.667
AND YOU ASK ME
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU,

18:19.700 --> 18:23.067
AND NOW YOU'RE RELIGIOUS.
SPIRITUAL.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.600
WELL, NOT TO ME.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.733
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

18:31.633 --> 18:35.100
WELL, RIGHT NOW
WE'RE WORKING.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.333
PAGE ME
IF HE SPIKES A FEVER.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.833
TELL MRS. DAVISON TO HIRE
A PRIVATE THERAPIST OR A PRIEST,

18:39.867 --> 18:43.400
ANYONE JUSTIN WOULD TALK TO.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.333
MRS. EPSTEIN?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.167
OH.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.233
HOW IS HE?

18:57.267 --> 18:59.533
HE'S GONNA BE FINE. HE'S STILL
A LITTLE GROGGY, BUT--

18:59.567 --> 19:01.600
MY DAD WANTS TO SEE ME NOW,
OKAY?

19:01.633 --> 19:02.733
OKAY. COME ON IN.
OKAY.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.233
WE HAVE TO RUN, RUN, RUN FAST.

19:05.267 --> 19:06.700
(whispering)
YEAH, LET'S RUN, RUN, RUN.

19:06.733 --> 19:08.833
LET'S RUN AND SEE DADDY.
IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.700
DADDY'S OKAY.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.433
DADDY! DADDY!

19:13.467 --> 19:15.400
I COULD KISS IT BETTER,
DADDY.

19:15.433 --> 19:18.533
JILLIAN, I HAVE A HEADACHE.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.067
I'LL SING FOR YOU, DADDY.
NO.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.467
* DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW
ON A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH *
NO, LEAH.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.200
DAMN IT, LEAH, SHUT UP!

19:25.233 --> 19:27.300
I CAN'T STAND
THAT INSIPID SONG!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.700
TIM!

19:28.733 --> 19:30.633
JUST GET OUT! GET OUT!

19:30.667 --> 19:33.500
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE,
ALL OF YOU!

19:33.533 --> 19:36.167
YOU STUPID SHEPHERD,

19:36.200 --> 19:39.067
YOU BROKE MY DAD'S BRAIN!

19:46.700 --> 19:49.100
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
I MEAN, HIS PERSONALITY...

19:49.133 --> 19:51.467
YOU DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR
THE FRONTAL LOBE.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.400
WELL, THE C.T. MIGHT HAVE
MISSED SOMETHING,

19:53.433 --> 19:55.333
OR THE PERSONALITY CHANGE
COULD BE A REACTION

19:55.367 --> 19:57.300
FROM THE ANESTHESIA
WEARING OFF.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.233
IT COULD BE THE PAIN.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.167
HE WAS IN PAIN
BEFORE THE SURGERY.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.100
WATCH HIM
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.567
IF HE DOESN'T IMPROVE,
GET A NEW C.T.
OKAY.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.667
DR. STEVENS?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.633
YOU HAD HIS BRAIN OPEN,
LITERALLY OPEN.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.133
HE WAS LAYING THERE
UNCONSCIOUS AND VULNERABLE...

20:12.167 --> 20:14.400
AND YOU THINK I POISONED HIM
WITH MY ANTI-HOLIDAY VENOM?

20:14.433 --> 20:16.333
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S ALWAYS SAYING

20:16.367 --> 20:18.433
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THE BRAIN
THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.133
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOUR WORDS
DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM

20:21.167 --> 20:22.500
ON SOME UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL?

20:22.533 --> 20:25.400
I MEAN, HE TRUSTED YOU
TO BE HIS SHEPHERD.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.233
DR. STEVENS, YOU SHOULD BE
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.033
I AM.
GOOD.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.333
OH, THIS IS THE C.C.U.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.333
THERE ARE NO TREES ALLOWED
IN THE C.C.U.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.667
I KNOW, BUT IT'S NEVER
REALLY BEEN ENFORCED, SO...

20:43.700 --> 20:45.400
HOW'S HE DOING?

20:45.433 --> 20:48.333
UH, SURGERY WENT SMOOTHLY,
BUT IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL.

20:50.267 --> 20:52.167
HE'S REALLY A GOOD BOY,
YOU KNOW?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.600
YOU JUST MET HIM
AT A DIFFICULT TIME.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.833
HE'S BEEN DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

20:56.867 --> 20:59.567
BUT FATHER MICHAEL WILL
BE ABLE TO TALK TO HIM.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.433
NO OFFENSE,

21:01.467 --> 21:05.367
BUT YOUR SON DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE A FAN OF THE HOLIDAYS.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.667
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN SANTA.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.067
YES, WELL, A MOTHER'S JOB

21:11.067 --> 21:14.200
IS TO PROTECT
HER CHILD'S INNOCENCE,

21:14.233 --> 21:17.167
AND THIS CHRISTMAS
COULD BE HIS LAST TIME, SO...

21:17.200 --> 21:19.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
LAST YEAR

21:19.567 --> 21:21.300
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.400
BABY, YOU'RE AWAKE!

21:25.433 --> 21:27.400
YOU LOOK GREAT!

21:27.433 --> 21:29.333
MY BIG, STRONG BOY.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.400
SANTA BROUGHT YOU BACK
TO ME.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.167
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.100
SORRY, C.C.U. REGULATIONS.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.500
(Meredith)
ARE WE USING MESH?

21:43.533 --> 21:47.100
YES, THE CONJOINED TENDON
IS...

21:47.133 --> 21:49.467
(groaning)

21:49.500 --> 21:51.433
DR. BAILEY?

21:51.467 --> 21:54.533
JUST WOULDN'T WANT TO THROW UP
IN THE BODY CAVITY.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.500
DR. BAILEY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
MNH.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.067
DO YOU NEED--

21:58.067 --> 22:00.700
I JUST...
I NEED A MINUTE, GREY.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.733
OH, WHEN YOU OPERATE,

22:02.767 --> 22:05.067
THE REST OF THE WORLD
GOES AWAY--

22:05.100 --> 22:07.133
HUNGER, THIRST, PAIN.

22:07.167 --> 22:10.067
YOU DON'T FEEL IT
IN THE O.R.,

22:10.100 --> 22:12.267
BUT IT'S NOT THAT WAY

22:12.300 --> 22:15.733
WHEN YOU'RE SHARING YOUR BODY
WITH ANOTHER PERSON.

22:15.767 --> 22:19.167
OKAY.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.800
DEAVER RETRACTOR.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.767
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT ME

22:22.800 --> 22:24.433
TO GO FIND SOMEONE
TO TAKE OVER FOR YOU?

22:24.467 --> 22:27.233
WHAT I WANT YOU TO FIND ME
IS A STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE,

22:27.267 --> 22:29.533
EXTRA THICK.

22:29.567 --> 22:30.800
SERIOUSLY?

22:30.833 --> 22:34.433
YEAH, NAUSEA COMES
WITH THE HUNGER, GREY.

22:34.467 --> 22:36.300
GO.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.700
MY THROAT--
IT'S, LIKE, WICKED SORE, YO!

22:40.733 --> 22:44.067
PLUS, I GOT ALL THESE
SICK BREAKOUTS, RIGHT?

22:45.433 --> 22:47.067
DUDE, SERIOUSLY...

22:50.767 --> 22:52.667
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.467
OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.333
I'D LIKE TO INSPECT
YOUR TONSILS.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.333
AAH!

23:02.500 --> 23:05.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
ARE YOU SICK?

23:05.133 --> 23:06.300
FIX IT.

23:07.767 --> 23:11.067
I FAILED
MY PRACTICAL BOARD EXAM.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.833
O'MALLEY'S HELPING ME STUDY.

23:12.867 --> 23:14.700
YOU FAILED YOUR...
YOU'RE HELPING HIM?

23:14.733 --> 23:16.833
JUST TO STUDY,
NOTHING ELSE!
IZZIE--

23:16.867 --> 23:19.467
NO, YOU DON'T GET
TO SAY MY NAME,

23:19.500 --> 23:21.400
AND YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE!

23:21.433 --> 23:23.567
I WAS DOING MONO, THE WHOLE
FEVER AND GLANDS THING.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.667
THE ACNE WAS JUST PART
OF THE WHOLE TEENAGER THING.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.333
IZZIE, WOULD YOU WAIT?

23:27.367 --> 23:30.100
I SAY I LIKE THE GUY,
AND YOU CAN'T STOP HATING HIM.

23:30.133 --> 23:32.200
IZZIE, YOU--
AND AS SOON
AS HE SCREWS ME OVER...

23:32.233 --> 23:34.600
IZZIE--
YOU'RE HIS
NEW BEST FRIEND.

23:34.633 --> 23:36.533
HE FAILED HIS BOARDS.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

23:36.567 --> 23:38.200
HE CHEATED ON ME!
BUSTED?

23:38.233 --> 23:40.133
YEAH, I'M BUSTED.
HIS EXAM IS TOMORROW.

23:40.167 --> 23:42.667
YOU'RE IN ON THIS, TOO?
HE CHEATED ON ME, GOD!

23:42.700 --> 23:45.567
TOLD YOU SHE'D FIND OUT.
OH, OF COURSE
YOU'RE IN ON THIS.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.367
SHE LET HIM TOUCH
HER BOOBS!
OH!

23:47.400 --> 23:50.167
HE CHEATED ON ME WITH
GEORGE'S SKANKY SYPH NURSE!

23:50.200 --> 23:52.533
(George)
THAT IS JUST PLAIN RUDE!
WE KNOW HE CHEATED ON YOU.

23:52.567 --> 23:54.433
THAT'S WHY WE LET YOU
TURN THE LIVING ROOM

23:54.467 --> 23:56.267
INTO SANTA'S FREAKIN' VILLAGE.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.767
WHAT?
WE'RE NOT BIG ON HOLIDAYS!

23:57.800 --> 24:00.633
YOU KNOW THAT, BUT WE'RE
TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE,

24:00.667 --> 24:01.667
BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING
A HARD TIME.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.400
BUT RIGHT NOW, ALEX,
HE'S HAVING A HARDER TIME.

24:04.433 --> 24:07.500
WHY DOES EVERYBODY CARE WHAT
KIND OF TIME ALEX IS HAVING?

24:07.533 --> 24:09.300
BECAUSE HE'S
DIRTY UNCLE SAL.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.567
YOU LOST ME.
SORRY, WHAT?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.467
HE'S DIRTY UNCLE SAL,

24:13.500 --> 24:16.067
THE ONE WHO EMBARRASSES EVERYONE
AT FAMILY REUNIONS

24:16.100 --> 24:18.733
AND WHO CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE
WITH THE TEENAGE GIRLS,

24:18.767 --> 24:21.633
BUT YOU INVITE HIM
TO THE PICNIC ANYWAY.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.533
I'M STILL LOST.
SORRY, WHAT?

24:23.567 --> 24:25.100
I HAVE A MOTHER
WHO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

24:25.133 --> 24:26.533
AS FAR AS FAMILY GOES,

24:26.567 --> 24:28.467
THIS HOSPITAL,
YOU GUYS ARE IT,

24:28.500 --> 24:31.333
SO I KNOW
YOU'RE PISSED AT ALEX,

24:31.367 --> 24:33.633
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TRY
TO HELP HIM ANYWAY,

24:33.667 --> 24:36.233
SORT OF LIKE IN THE SPIRIT
OF THIS HOLIDAY

24:36.267 --> 24:39.100
YOU KEEP SHOVING
DOWN EVERYBODY'S THROATS.

24:40.067 --> 24:41.733
YOU...

24:41.767 --> 24:43.600
WHAT?

24:43.633 --> 24:45.733
BOOB?

24:45.767 --> 24:48.467
(pager beeps)

24:48.500 --> 24:50.467
SOMEBODY GET IN HERE!
DOCTOR!

24:50.500 --> 24:51.667
GET IN HERE NOW!

24:51.700 --> 24:54.600
GET IN HERE!
WHERE IS HE?
DO SOMETHING!

24:54.633 --> 24:56.533
NASTY!
AAH!

24:56.567 --> 24:59.267
DO SOMETHING, DOCTOR!
I'M TAKING YOU TO SURGERY.
PREP HER NOW.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.133
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

25:06.167 --> 25:07.800
SORRY.
I GOT SIDETRACKED.

25:07.833 --> 25:10.133
NADIA SHELTON'S
ULCER PERFORATED.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.433
SHE'S VOMITING BLOOD
BY THE PINT.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.500
IS THE CHIEF BACK?

25:14.533 --> 25:15.767
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.733
NO.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.400
ALL RIGHT, UH,

25:18.433 --> 25:20.233
BOTH OF YOU SCRUB IN.

25:20.267 --> 25:22.667
I'M GONNA NEED
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.733
(Derek) WELL, THERE IT IS--

25:27.767 --> 25:29.667
LEFT SIDE OF HIS FRONTAL LOBE.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.600
NOW WHY DIDN'T
WE SEE THAT BEFORE?

25:31.633 --> 25:33.733
INTRACEREBRAL BLEEDS CAN HAVE
A DELAYED PRESENTATION.

25:33.767 --> 25:35.767
RIGHT. YOU WANT
TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE?

25:35.800 --> 25:38.500
UH, JUST PREP AN O.R.
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIS WIFE.

25:38.533 --> 25:40.600
DR. STEVENS.

25:40.633 --> 25:43.100
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

25:43.133 --> 25:45.100
THINK SHE'LL EVER TALK
TO ME AGAIN?

25:47.167 --> 25:49.767
OKAY, AM I INVISIBLE?
I'M FEELING STRANGELY INVISIBLE.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.767
ALSO INAUDIBLE.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.267
WHAT?

25:53.300 --> 25:55.133
ANOTHER SURGERY?

25:55.167 --> 25:57.467
SO I GUESS DINNER-SHOPPING
IS OUT?

25:57.500 --> 25:59.300
YEAH, IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.100
SORRY.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

26:01.133 --> 26:03.367
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU'RE NOT.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.733
IT'S CHRISTMAS, DEREK.

26:04.767 --> 26:07.133
YEAH, I KNOW.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.067
IT'S OUR SEASON!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:09.100 --> 26:11.067
ARE YOU MAD?
ARE YOU DEPRESSED, WHAT?

26:11.067 --> 26:12.633
NO. MR. EPSTEIN HERE
IS DEPRESSED.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.333
HE'S BLEEDING
FROM HIS FRONTAL LOBE.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.800
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
WE'RE FINE, ADDIE.

26:16.833 --> 26:19.700
YOU KNOW, JUST...
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, OKAY?

26:19.733 --> 26:22.467
YOU NEED A SECOND SURGERY,
MR. EPSTEIN.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.400
THE FRONTAL LOBE
IS DIFFICULT.

26:24.433 --> 26:26.400
WE MAY BE ABLE
TO IMPROVE THINGS,

26:26.433 --> 26:28.333
BUT, UH,
YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED

26:28.367 --> 26:30.667
FOR THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THINGS COULD GET WORSE.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.167
THAT'S GREAT,
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.367
I AM SO GLAD
WE CAME TO THIS HOSPITAL,

26:36.400 --> 26:39.333
SO I COULD BE TREATED
BY A BUNCH OF QUACKS

26:39.367 --> 26:42.700
WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR ASSES
FROM THE INSIDE OF MY SKULL!

26:47.300 --> 26:49.133
THIS ISN'T MY HUSBAND.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.833
THIS IS NOT MY HUSBAND.

26:50.867 --> 26:52.767
HE DOESN'T SPEAK TO ME
THIS WAY.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.700
HE DOESN'T SPEAK TO ANYONE
THIS WAY.

26:54.733 --> 26:56.600
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT,
MRS. EPSTEIN,

26:56.633 --> 26:58.533
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
RIGHT NOW

26:58.567 --> 27:00.467
IS THAT WE STOP THE BLEEDING.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.400
LOOK,
HE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

27:02.433 --> 27:05.300
AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A LOT OF OTHER PATIENTS

27:05.333 --> 27:07.267
AND YOU DO
A LOT OF OTHER SURGERIES,

27:07.300 --> 27:10.067
BUT HE'S THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.733
JUST...
I JUST NEED YOUR WORD

27:11.767 --> 27:14.200
THAT YOU'LL TREAT THIS CHANGE
IN MY HUSBAND'S PERSONALITY

27:14.233 --> 27:17.100
AS SERIOUSLY
AS YOU WOULD FATAL CANCER,

27:17.133 --> 27:20.433
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
THIS FEELS TO ME AND MY KIDS.

27:20.467 --> 27:23.233
AND WE'RE HAPPY.
WE'RE A HAPPY FAMILY.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.367
IT JUST...
IF YOU COULD JUST FIX IT...

27:25.400 --> 27:28.133
JUST FIX IT.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.067
MRS. EPSTEIN,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.500
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER, ALL RIGHT?

27:32.533 --> 27:34.433
OKAY?

27:34.467 --> 27:36.800
I DIDN'T WANT IT.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.733
I ALREADY GOT ONE NEW HEART.

27:38.767 --> 27:41.533
I DIDN'T DESERVE ANOTHER ONE.

27:41.567 --> 27:43.467
JUSTIN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FEEL GUILTY

27:43.500 --> 27:44.800
ABOUT HAVING A NEW HEART.

27:44.833 --> 27:47.200
GOD WANTS YOU TO LIVE.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.133
THAT'S WHY HE SENT YOU
THE HEART.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.100
I'M NOT STUPID, OKAY?
GOD DIDN'T SEND ME THE HEART,

27:51.133 --> 27:53.433
AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GOD.
JUSTIN!

27:53.467 --> 27:55.467
MARION, MARION.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.833
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:56.867 --> 27:58.367
THE HEART I HAVE NOW--

27:58.400 --> 28:00.700
MY MOM TOLD ME THE HEART
CAME FROM SANTA.

28:00.733 --> 28:03.600
I THOUGHT ELVES MADE IT
IN THEIR FACTORY

28:03.633 --> 28:05.433
OR WHATEVER,

28:05.467 --> 28:07.533
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE,
IS IT?

28:07.567 --> 28:08.833
NO, IT ISN'T.

28:08.867 --> 28:10.600
YEAH.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.600
I HEARD THE NURSES TALKING.

28:12.633 --> 28:15.100
WHERE IT REALLY CAME FROM
IS SOME OTHER KID.

28:15.133 --> 28:17.300
SOME OTHER KID HAD TO DIE
SO I COULD LIVE.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.133
JUSTIN...

28:19.167 --> 28:19.967
BABY...

28:20.067 --> 28:22.667
AND THEN
I OUTGREW THAT KID'S HEART.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.200
SO FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS
MY MOM HAS BEEN PRAYING

28:25.233 --> 28:28.400
THAT ANOTHER KID
WOULD DIE FOR ME.

28:28.433 --> 28:31.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU PRAY FOR
ALL THE TIME,

28:31.567 --> 28:34.200
ISN'T IT, MOM?

28:36.167 --> 28:39.300
THAT'S WHAT SHE PRAYS FOR,
FATHER.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.133
HOW DOES GOD FEEL ABOUT THAT?

28:42.167 --> 28:44.067
JUSTIN, JUSTIN...

28:44.100 --> 28:46.100
JUSTIN?
(monitor beeping rapidly)

28:46.133 --> 28:47.800
(Marion) JUSTIN, BABY?

28:47.833 --> 28:49.500
WAKE UP, JUSTIN!

28:49.533 --> 28:51.067
(long, steady beep)
NURSE!

28:51.067 --> 28:53.367
MOVE, PLEASE!
NO, NO, NO!

28:53.400 --> 28:55.067
CODE BLUE!
PLEASE, JUSTIN!

28:55.067 --> 28:56.433
JUST STAY BACK.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.333
(Woman over P.A.) CODE BLUE,
PEDIATRIC C.C.U.

28:58.367 --> 29:00.100
DEAR GOD, PLEASE!

29:00.133 --> 29:02.233
JUSTIN, BABY,
I'M RIGHT HERE!

29:02.267 --> 29:04.167
JUSTIN, I LOVE YOU, BABY!
PLEASE SHUT HER UP!

29:04.200 --> 29:05.667
(crying)
HE'S IN V-FIB.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.433
CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 100.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.600
CHARGE.

29:09.633 --> 29:11.800
CLEAR.
(paddles crackle)

29:13.600 --> 29:16.767
(coughs)

29:16.800 --> 29:18.633
(monitor beeps steadily)

29:18.667 --> 29:21.400
(coughs)

29:21.433 --> 29:24.333
***

29:36.700 --> 29:38.600
CAN YOU GET HIM BACK
ON THE DONOR'S LIST?

29:38.633 --> 29:39.533
I MEAN, IF IT'S A BAD HEART.
IT'S NOT A BAD HEART.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.600
WELL, CAN YOU GET HIM
BACK ON THE LIST?

29:41.633 --> 29:43.500
HE'S WAITED TWO YEARS
FOR THIS HEART.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.167
HE HAS TO FIGHT FOR IT.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.267
HE HAS TO DECIDE
HE WANTS TO LIVE.
OKAY, MEDICALLY SPEAKING,

29:47.300 --> 29:49.367
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.300
THE WAY YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW--

29:51.333 --> 29:53.733
IT'S WHY I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN SOMETHING BIGGER IN ME.

29:53.767 --> 29:55.267
BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T,

29:55.300 --> 29:58.267
THAT POWERLESSNESS
WOULD EAT ME ALIVE.

30:03.533 --> 30:04.633
(sighs)

30:04.667 --> 30:06.233
DRILL, PLEASE.

30:06.267 --> 30:08.500
ANY DANGER WITH TWO CRANIOTOMIES
IN ONE DAY?

30:08.533 --> 30:10.300
NO MORE THAN WITH ONE.

30:10.333 --> 30:11.533
(drill buzzes)

30:11.567 --> 30:14.833
IS THERE ANY MUSIC?

30:14.867 --> 30:16.433
ANY REQUESTS?

30:16.467 --> 30:18.800
CHRISTMAS CAROLS
OR HANUKKAH.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.800
IS THERE SUCH A THING
AS HANUKKAH CAROLS?

30:23.500 --> 30:26.333
THE BRAIN IS A MYSTERIOUS THING,
DR. STEVENS.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.167
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
MAY PENETRATE THE PSYCHE.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.633
* HANUKKAH,
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT *

30:32.667 --> 30:34.433
(George) WHOA, LOOK AT THAT.

30:34.467 --> 30:35.800
(Meredith) KISSING ULCERS.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.733
ONE'S PERFED.
THE OTHER ONE IS BLEEDING.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.267
TWO ULCERS. I'M NOT SURPRISED
WITH THAT FAMILY.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.600
I SHOULD'VE THROWN THEM OUT.
WHY DIDN'T I THROW THEM OUT?

30:42.633 --> 30:44.133
THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD HAVE DONE.

30:44.167 --> 30:46.167
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.367
STOP WHINING, O'MALLEY.
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.300
YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT.
MOVE ON.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.500
RIGHT, SORRY.

30:52.533 --> 30:55.267
DO NOT KICK ME!

30:55.300 --> 30:57.333
EXCUSE ME?

30:57.367 --> 30:59.400
ARE YOU KICKING ME
UNDER THE TABLE, O'MALLEY?

30:59.433 --> 31:01.067
NO!

31:01.100 --> 31:03.800
THEN CLEARLY
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.

31:03.833 --> 31:07.833
(groaning)

31:07.867 --> 31:12.467
YOU CANNOT KICK ME
WHILE I'M DOING MY JOB.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.267
THANK YOU.

31:18.300 --> 31:21.833
* YOUR WEIRD UNCLE'S
DOING THE CAN-CAN *

31:21.867 --> 31:26.367
* HANUKKAH HARRY,
HE'S THE MAN *

31:26.400 --> 31:28.767
* EVERYONE'S HERE,
IT'S HANUKKAH *

31:28.800 --> 31:30.200
WAKE UP!

31:30.233 --> 31:33.100
GOD, NO WONDER
YOU FAILED YOUR BOARDS.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.467
WHAT, DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN
THIS STUFF BY OSMOSIS?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

31:37.300 --> 31:38.767
I'M A FARMER, OKAY?

31:38.800 --> 31:41.433
I'VE BEEN DROOLING AND PUKING
AND CRAPPING MY PANTS.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.467
YOU CAME HERE
TO HELP ME STUDY?

31:43.500 --> 31:47.233
WELL, I'M NOT ACTUALLY
CRAPPING MY PANTS NOW, AM I?

31:47.267 --> 31:50.100
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HELP ME

31:50.133 --> 31:52.233
AFTER WHAT I DID?

31:52.267 --> 31:56.067
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT JESUS
WOULD FREAKIN' DO!

32:07.100 --> 32:09.667
* LO

32:09.700 --> 32:15.167
* HOW A ROSE E'ER BLOOMING

32:15.200 --> 32:20.667
* FROM TENDER STEM
HATH SPRUNG *

32:20.700 --> 32:23.400
YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN SANTA EITHER, JUSTIN,

32:23.433 --> 32:26.467
OR GOD.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.367
I BELIEVE IN MEDICINE,

32:29.400 --> 32:33.333
AND IT'S A MEDICAL MIRACLE
YOU'RE ALIVE.

32:33.367 --> 32:36.067
WITH THE HEART YOU HAD,

32:36.067 --> 32:38.067
YOU SHOULD HAVE--
YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED

32:38.100 --> 32:39.833
ABOUT TWO WEEKS
AFTER YOU WERE BORN,

32:39.867 --> 32:41.833
EXCEPT SOME SURGEON
FIGURED OUT A WAY

32:41.867 --> 32:44.067
TO GIVE YOU
SOMEONE ELSE'S HEART,

32:44.067 --> 32:46.733
WHICH IS SO MUCH COOLER
THAN SANTA.

32:46.767 --> 32:51.833
* AMID THE COLD OF WINTER

32:51.867 --> 32:55.200
SO I'M JUST SAYING

32:55.233 --> 33:00.633
I THINK YOU SHOULD DECIDE
TO LIVE,

33:00.667 --> 33:03.500
LIVE SO YOU CAN BECOME
A DOCTOR,

33:03.533 --> 33:05.667
AND YOU CAN FIND A WAY
TO DO HEART TRANSPLANTS

33:05.700 --> 33:08.633
WITHOUT SOMEONE
HAVING TO DIE.

33:08.667 --> 33:12.067
OR YOU KNOW,
LIVE SO YOU CAN GROW UP

33:12.100 --> 33:14.133
AND HAVE KIDS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:14.167 --> 33:16.733
RAISE THEM NOT TO BELIEVE
IN SANTA.

33:16.767 --> 33:20.733
NOW THAT WOULD PISS
YOUR MOM OFF.

33:20.767 --> 33:22.733
* TO SHOW GOD'S LOVE ARIGHT...

33:22.767 --> 33:26.067
JUST DECIDE TO LIVE.

33:26.067 --> 33:29.567
BECAUSE IN YOUR CASE,

33:29.600 --> 33:32.600
DYING REALLY ISN'T
THE BEST REVENGE.

33:32.633 --> 33:35.533
* WHEN HALF SPENT

33:35.567 --> 33:43.100
* WAS THE NIGHT

33:49.667 --> 33:51.767
HOW IS SHE?
IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

33:51.800 --> 33:53.267
SHE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,

33:53.300 --> 33:56.100
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO REPLACE IT
AND REPAIR THE TEAR.

33:56.133 --> 33:59.267
SHE'S GONNA REQUIRE
SEVERAL DAYS' OBSERVATION,

33:59.300 --> 34:01.567
BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE
A FULL RECOVERY.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.667
OH, THANK GOD.
THANK GOD IS RIGHT.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.267
'CAUSE WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA THANK YOU.

34:06.300 --> 34:08.700
WE SHOULD SUE YOU
FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH.

34:08.733 --> 34:10.300
WE SAT HERE AND SAT HERE

34:10.333 --> 34:14.267
AND SAT HERE AND SAT HERE...
YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT?

34:14.300 --> 34:15.700
REALLY?

34:15.733 --> 34:16.800
AND WATCHED YOU TAKE
PATIENT AFTER PATIENT...

34:16.833 --> 34:19.133
YOU GOT YOUR SECOND CHANCE.
JUST DON'T SCREW IT UP.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.333
...WHILE YOU MADE MY DAUGHTER
WAIT FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS

34:21.367 --> 34:22.567
FOR HER OPERATION!

34:22.600 --> 34:25.067
I SHOULD SUE YOU
AND THIS WHOLE DAMN HOSPITAL!

34:25.067 --> 34:27.067
OKAY, YEAH,
YOU COULD SUE US,

34:27.067 --> 34:30.200
OR YOU COULD JUST CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

34:30.233 --> 34:32.133
OF JUST SHUTTING THE HELL UP.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

34:32.167 --> 34:33.400
DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID TO ME?
I HEARD HIM!

34:33.433 --> 34:35.800
YOU CAN'T TALK TO AN OLD LADY
LIKE THAT.
WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?

34:35.833 --> 34:38.300
I'D LIKE TO SEE HER.
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.667
I'M HER DOCTOR.

34:39.700 --> 34:41.833
SHE IS MY PATIENT,
AND THIS IS A HOSPITAL,

34:41.867 --> 34:43.633
WHICH IS THE KIND OF PLACE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GENERALLY USE

34:43.667 --> 34:45.567
A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET,

34:45.600 --> 34:47.600
SO NO, RIGHT NOW
YOU CAN'T SEE HER.

34:47.633 --> 34:49.533
AND I AM NOT SAYING THIS
BECAUSE YOU JUST THREATENED

34:49.567 --> 34:51.400
TO SUE DR. BAILEY, WHO SPENT
THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS

34:51.433 --> 34:53.433
SAVING YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE,
SAVING YOUR WIFE'S LIFE.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.067
I AM SAYING THIS
BECAUSE SHE IS MY PATIENT,

34:56.100 --> 34:57.267
AND SHE IS
IN THE RECOVERY WING

34:57.300 --> 34:59.400
OF THIS HOSPITAL
TRYING TO RECOVER,

34:59.433 --> 35:03.667
AND VISITING HOURS ARE OVER,
SO GOOD NIGHT

35:03.700 --> 35:05.400
AND MERRY CHRISTMAS.

35:11.167 --> 35:13.067
INTERNS.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.267
TOO EMOTIONAL.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.233
MY APOLOGIES.

35:22.100 --> 35:25.167
UM, IS THE NAUSEA CONSTANT

35:25.200 --> 35:27.100
OR INTERMITTENT?

35:27.133 --> 35:29.267
CONSTANT.

35:31.533 --> 35:33.700
WHEN...

35:33.733 --> 35:37.067
WHEN DID IT FIRST START?

35:37.100 --> 35:40.167
AFTER I WORKED
IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.567
DO YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES

35:43.600 --> 35:45.467
YOU'RE AWARE OF?

35:47.333 --> 35:50.067
NO.

35:50.067 --> 35:54.200
(crying)

36:00.533 --> 36:03.567
IZZIE...

36:03.600 --> 36:06.667
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.500
YOU DIDN'T HURT ME.

36:10.533 --> 36:13.800
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
I'M A FARMER.

36:13.833 --> 36:16.633
YOU...
YOU'RE STILL THE PATIENT?

36:16.667 --> 36:19.167
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

36:23.833 --> 36:26.367
IT'S ORGANOPHOSPHATES,

36:26.400 --> 36:29.333
PESTICIDE POISONING.

36:29.367 --> 36:32.200
CRYING'S A SYMPTOM.
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?

36:34.367 --> 36:37.333
RIGHT.

36:40.533 --> 36:45.300
* IT CAME UPON
A MIDNIGHT CLEAR *

36:45.333 --> 36:49.533
* THE GLORIOUS SONG OF OLD

36:49.567 --> 36:51.667
* FROM ANGELS BENDING
NEAR THE EARTH *

36:51.700 --> 36:53.600
HEY.

36:53.633 --> 36:55.800
* TO TOUCH THEIR HEARTS

36:55.833 --> 36:56.667
HEY.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.267
YOU OKAY?

36:59.300 --> 37:01.500
YEAH, YEAH.

37:01.533 --> 37:04.067
YOU KNOW, HOLIDAYS.

37:04.067 --> 37:06.367
YEAH.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.800
I DO KNOW.

37:07.833 --> 37:12.133
* THE WORLD
IN SOLEMN STILLNESS LAY *

37:12.167 --> 37:15.100
* TO HEAR THE ANGELS SING...

37:15.133 --> 37:16.300
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.067
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.533
(door bells jingle)

37:25.567 --> 37:27.100
HEY.

37:27.133 --> 37:30.467
CHRISTMAS DOUBLE SCOTCH,
SINGLE MALT.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.300
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.133
(Addie) HEY, DR. SHEPHERD.

37:35.733 --> 37:37.433
DR. SHEPHERD.

37:37.467 --> 37:41.800
* O'ER ALL THE WEARY WORLD

37:41.833 --> 37:43.067
* ABOVE...

37:43.100 --> 37:46.700
SO... HOW'S MR. EPSTEIN'S
FRONTAL LOBE?

37:46.733 --> 37:49.433
HE WOKE UP SMILING.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.567
CONGRATULATIONS.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.733
THANK YOU.

37:51.767 --> 37:53.700
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
(laughs)

37:53.733 --> 37:57.133
IT'S HOT BUTTERED RUM.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.500
IT'S DICKENSIAN.

37:58.533 --> 38:01.067
OH, WELL, YEAH,
IT IS CHRISTMAS.

38:01.067 --> 38:05.067
CHRISTMAS, DEREK.
WE LOVE CHRISTMAS.

38:05.100 --> 38:08.067
AT LEAST WE USED TO.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.533
YEAH.

38:10.567 --> 38:13.433
CHRISTMAS MAKES YOU WANT TO BE
WITH PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

38:18.467 --> 38:21.333
I'M NOT SAYING THIS
TO HURT YOU

38:21.367 --> 38:24.233
OR BECAUSE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU,
BECAUSE I DON'T.

38:24.267 --> 38:28.467
MEREDITH WASN'T A FLING.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.600
SHE WASN'T REVENGE.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.400
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

38:40.300 --> 38:43.433
THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY BECAUSE
I DECIDED TO STAY WITH YOU.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.767
THERE'S AN OLD PROVERB

38:49.800 --> 38:52.367
THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T CHOOSE
YOUR FAMILY.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.267
* O YE, BENEATH
LIFE'S CRUSHING LOAD *

38:54.300 --> 38:59.400
* WHOSE FORMS
ARE BENDING LOW *

38:59.433 --> 39:01.367
YOU TAKE WHAT THE FATES
HAND YOU.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.500
* TOIL ALONG THE CLIMBING WAY

39:03.533 --> 39:07.667
* WITH PAINFUL STEPS AND SLOW

39:07.700 --> 39:10.567
* LOOK NOW, FOR GLAD AND...

39:10.600 --> 39:13.333
AND LIKE THEM OR NOT,

39:13.367 --> 39:15.233
LOVE THEM OR NOT,

39:15.267 --> 39:17.333
UNDERSTAND THEM OR NOT...

39:17.367 --> 39:19.567
JUSTIN TOOK A TURN.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.467
HIS FEVER'S DOWN,
AND HIS B.P. IS UP.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.500
* AND HEAR THE ANGELS SING

39:25.533 --> 39:27.600
I WONDER WHAT
GOT THROUGH TO HIM.

39:27.633 --> 39:31.600
* THE ANGELS SING

39:31.633 --> 39:33.800
I DON'T KNOW.

39:33.833 --> 39:35.467
...YOU COPE.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.167
PRETTY.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.300
YEAH.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.467
THEN THERE'S
THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

39:52.500 --> 39:54.567
THAT SAYS THE FAMILY
YOU'RE BORN INTO

39:54.600 --> 39:56.467
IS SIMPLY A STARTING POINT.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.133
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

39:58.167 --> 40:00.467
LIGHTS.

40:00.500 --> 40:04.567
* LOOK NOW, FOR GLAD
AND GOLDEN HOURS *

40:04.600 --> 40:07.200
* COME SWIFTLY ON THE WING

40:07.233 --> 40:10.100
THEY FEED YOU
AND CLOTHE YOU

40:10.133 --> 40:11.833
AND TAKE CARE OF YOU

40:11.867 --> 40:15.500
UNTIL YOU'RE READY
TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD...

40:15.533 --> 40:17.167
(barks)

40:18.367 --> 40:21.267
...AND FIND YOUR TRIBE.
