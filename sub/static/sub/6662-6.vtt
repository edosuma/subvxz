on the stand

what you saw.

to my sister, Siobhan, for help.

Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

BRIDGET: It was so easy.

00:25.730 --> 00:27.230
I saw a way out,

There's a lot about Siobhan's

Everyone's going to know
who you really are, Bridget.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.870
How long have you been
pretending to be her?

00:43.910 --> 00:45.920
Can you come over, please?
I need to tell you something.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.130
It's an emergency.

leaving the drug store.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.610
Asked me if I could come over

01:56.650 --> 01:58.240

important to tell me.

The thing is, when
I got to the Butlers',

Henry told me she wasn't there.
That's a bit odd, right?

02:04.950 --> 02:07.000
The thing is, she
sounded a bit off

02:07.040 --> 02:09.040
when we spoke, and so did
Henry for that matter.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.540

02:10.580 --> 02:12.540
what she wanted
to talk to me about?

Not a clue.

a call in the morning.

Hey, Gemma, Andrew told me that
you called him last night.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.660
I can only think of one thing

03:31.710 --> 03:34.420
that you would want
to talk to him about.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.460
I thought we came
to an understanding.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.720
I know the last few days
have been...

03:40.760 --> 03:45.300

talking about hurting her?

No, not in the moment,
no, but then I came home

and the broken vase...

you last night,

there had to be a reason
why you didn't call me,

11:11.670 --> 11:13.000
and it hit me.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.420
You didn't want our

about blood.

your memory.

There was blood, Siobhan,
right here!

11:34.690 --> 11:36.190
With bleach
and a few old rags.

and I dumped it

11:37.780 --> 11:39.190
in long-term parking at JFK

11:39.240 --> 11:40.820
so that when everyone
finally realizes

11:40.860 --> 11:42.700
that Gemma's missing,

11:42.740 --> 11:44.530
maybe, just maybe,
the police won't figure out

that this is the place
that she was taken from.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.870
Why would you do that?

Because in spite
of everything

that you have put me
through

was to protect you.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.250
Then you made
a big mistake.

11:56.290 --> 11:58.420
Because I was with Andrew
and Juliet last night.

And I would never
hurt Gemma.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.890
when you clearly
look like

12:12.940 --> 12:14.270
the one that's snapped.

12:14.310 --> 12:16.730
You--you're accusing me
of hurting her?

12:16.770 --> 12:19.480
I'm not the one cleaning
up crime scenes.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.070
No, but you are the one
that talked about

12:21.110 --> 12:23.150
killing Gemma and Andrew.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.820
I love you.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.870
I love you,
Siobhan.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.290
[moans]

12:33.410 --> 12:36.170
I wish that we could
just disappear.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.380
Mmm!

12:38.420 --> 12:40.170
I wish they could
just disappear.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.090
Yeah, maybe the stock
market will crash

12:42.130 --> 12:43.880
and Andrew will
jump out a window,

12:43.920 --> 12:46.510
land on Gemma.

12:48.930 --> 12:53.850
Or...we could take matters
into our own hands.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.190
I'm just saying.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.520
We could finally
be together.

13:00.570 --> 13:03.690
No more sneaking around.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.370
Oh, my God.

13:12.410 --> 13:15.290
You're serious,
aren't you?

13:15.330 --> 13:17.790
Do you want me to be?

13:20.540 --> 13:22.380
[laughs]

13:22.420 --> 13:24.920
God, I'm joking.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.180
You're gullible.

13:27.220 --> 13:31.720
It's a good thing
you're so adorable.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.140
You tell me you
don't remember.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.520
I don't.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.980
But even if I did,
I would never...

13:37.020 --> 13:38.810
Never what?

13:38.850 --> 13:40.520
Huh? Never sleep with
your best friend's husband?

13:40.560 --> 13:43.360
Never get knocked up by him
and then kick him to the curb?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.360
You tell me, what would
a woman like you never do?

13:46.900 --> 13:49.780
Say something to me!

13:49.820 --> 13:51.870
Where is she?

13:54.870 --> 13:56.040
All right, I'm sorry. Sorry.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.620
Come on.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.670
I'm trying to help you,
Siobhan.

14:00.710 --> 14:01.920
You know me.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.500
No, I don't.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.970
I don't know you.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.550
And I never did.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.100
[siren wails,
indistinct radio transmissions]

14:17.140 --> 14:18.770
JIMMY: Sponsor
reported him missing

14:18.810 --> 14:21.730
when he didn't show for an
NA meeting a few days ago.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.900
Reached out to you in
New York because I thought

14:23.940 --> 14:25.530
he might've joined our old
friend Bridget Kelly

14:25.570 --> 14:27.070
on the lam.

14:27.110 --> 14:28.780
Figured maybe he left
a trail to her.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.160
But then a couple of unis
found his car over there.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.950
MACHADO: And signs
of a struggle.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.290
Wherever Malcolm Ward
is right now,

14:35.330 --> 14:37.000
I don't think
he's with Bridget.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.460
Just last week,
I saw his number
in the cell phone

14:39.500 --> 14:41.170
of Siobhan Martin,
Bridget's sister.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.630
There's a connection?

14:42.670 --> 14:45.090
I don't know yet,
but I will.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.880
I still owe her
for clocking me.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.260
Bridget Kelly--for this.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.680
Yeah, if I were you,
I'd be more worried

14:50.720 --> 14:52.300
about the gun
she stole from you.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.810
Yeah, well, either way,

14:54.850 --> 14:56.520
I don't know how it's been
going in the Big Apple,

14:56.560 --> 14:57.890
but believe me when I say

14:57.930 --> 15:00.560
no one wants you
to find her more than me.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.810
What is it?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.440
I think this is
where they waited.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.320
I think they
watched for him,
and then they took him.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.990
Bodaway Macawi's men.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.570
What if they realized
Malcolm Ward

15:13.620 --> 15:16.290
is more than just
Bridget's sponsor?

15:16.330 --> 15:18.000
Have your CSU guys
check these for DNA,

15:18.040 --> 15:19.460
see what they find.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.870
In the meantime, I
think we go see Macawi.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.750
[loud music playing]

15:25.130 --> 15:28.130
[music continues nearby]

15:28.170 --> 15:29.800
Talk.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.090
Come on, Prof.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.340
You tell us
where Bridget Kelly is,

15:33.390 --> 15:36.140
and we'll give you
what you need.

15:36.180 --> 15:38.680
[straining]
Go to hell.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.060
Nothing quite like
that smell, huh?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.270
[sizzling]

15:45.310 --> 15:46.570
Nothing quite
like that sound.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.230
Bet you can almost taste it.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.490
You were on
our best stuff for days.

15:51.530 --> 15:55.160
You took a couple days off.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
I'm thinking you're in a
whole nother world of hurt.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.710
Maybe tomorrow?

16:11.380 --> 16:12.550
Wait.

16:15.390 --> 16:17.510
I'll tell you...

16:17.550 --> 16:20.310
I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.770
[students chattering]

16:26.610 --> 16:29.020
Don't tell me you burned
through that 20 already.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.360
You know, I'm not here
for your money, bitch.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.740
OK, I'm here
to let you know,

16:32.780 --> 16:34.150
that you made
a serious mistake today.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.160
I didn't park
in your space, did I?

16:36.200 --> 16:40.160
Oh, no, wait the short
buses don't have spaces.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.870
You know what?
I have friends here, rich girl,

16:42.910 --> 16:44.750
and you don't.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.670
You sure you want
to keep shooting that
rich girl mouth off?

16:46.710 --> 16:48.540
The only thing
I'm sure of

16:48.590 --> 16:49.920
is that I don't like people
hitting me up for money

16:49.960 --> 16:51.130
in the middle of class.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.920
You apologize for that,

16:52.970 --> 16:56.890
and maybe I'll apologize
for everything else.

16:56.930 --> 16:58.680
Yeah. Sure.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.930
Here's your apology
right here.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.220
[screams]

17:01.270 --> 17:03.350
GIRL: Ohh!

17:13.110 --> 17:14.570
[students clamoring]

17:14.610 --> 17:17.820
[students chanting, "Fight!"]

17:22.830 --> 17:24.910
Hey! Break it up, people.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.080
[students clamoring]

17:28.130 --> 17:30.880
It's over.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.840
Come on.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.010
Come on.
Take them away.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.510
Come on.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.140
[phone line beeps]

17:47.190 --> 17:48.900
[recording]
You've reached Gemma.

17:48.940 --> 17:50.400
Don't be boring.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.790
[muffled screams]

18:13.460 --> 18:16.420
Shh. Stop. Stop it.
Stop. Shh. Stop.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.130
The last thing
either one of us needs

18:18.180 --> 18:19.760
is for one of your neighbors
to call the cops.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.970
Now, listen,
I'm not going to hurt you.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.260
I just want to talk, OK?

18:22.300 --> 18:24.220
I'm serious.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.480
Promise if I let you go,
you won't scream?

18:29.690 --> 18:31.690
Look, I'm sorry.

18:31.730 --> 18:33.730
After you left like you did,
I didn't know what to do.

18:33.770 --> 18:35.610
How the hell did
you get in here?

18:35.650 --> 18:37.030
I used this.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.450
You gave it to me,
when we were still together.

18:38.490 --> 18:40.820
I just...I came in
through the back.

18:40.860 --> 18:42.240
I just want to talk.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.160
So you can accuse
me of murder again?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.910
No, I believe you.
I thought about it,

18:45.950 --> 18:47.500
and you're not going to lie
about something like this.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.460
But I also need you
to believe me:

18:49.500 --> 18:51.210
I would never hurt
Gemma either.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.040
-Then who did?
-I don't know.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.920
Maybe she walked in
on a burglar.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.380
And the burglar just
took her with him?

18:56.420 --> 18:57.760
I don't know.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.680
Do you really think
it was me?

19:05.220 --> 19:08.060
She's the mother
of my children, Siobhan.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.890
Now, I know that you
may not love me anymore,

19:10.940 --> 19:14.400
but please tell me
that you still know me.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.190
Tell me that you know
I would never hurt her.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.360
You need to call
the police.

19:22.410 --> 19:23.870
You need to tell
them what you saw

19:23.910 --> 19:25.490
so they can start
looking for her.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.700
And how exactly
do I explain the fact

19:27.740 --> 19:30.330
that I cleaned up
all the blood?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.290
I couldn't look more guilty.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.500
Oh, wait. I could.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.300
I called
my attorney yesterday

19:36.340 --> 19:38.380
and told him to pull
the trigger on a divorce.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.590
So Gemma
is reported missing.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.090
How long until
the cops figure out

19:42.130 --> 19:44.140
that I was having an affair?

19:44.180 --> 19:46.310
And how long until they figure
out the other woman was you?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.980
You need to go.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.390
Come on. Listen,
I need your help, Siobhan.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.600
We're both in
this together.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.480
We got to
protect ourselves.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.110
We have to figure
out what happened.

19:59.150 --> 20:01.740
[elevator bell dings]

20:01.780 --> 20:03.360
I'm sorry. I just...

20:03.410 --> 20:05.950
I need some time
to think.

20:14.370 --> 20:16.630
[phone ringing]

20:23.720 --> 20:27.890
[people chattering]

20:27.930 --> 20:29.640
Hey.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.520
-Thank you for meeting me.
-It's OK.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.190
Did you bring it?

20:36.230 --> 20:37.610
Yeah.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.570
Am I just putting you in the
same predicament I was in?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.160
"E."

20:46.200 --> 20:49.870
This was never really
my bag, so to speak.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.620
But just to be safe...

20:56.580 --> 20:58.540
Now, why couldn't I
just do that?

20:58.590 --> 21:01.840
It's OK. It's OK.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.130
What's important
here is

21:05.180 --> 21:06.640
that you realized
you needed help

21:06.680 --> 21:08.680
and you reached out.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.970
And you can wake up
in the morning

21:11.010 --> 21:13.140
and you can look her
right in the eye

21:13.180 --> 21:17.060
and you can say you
have no regrets.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.860
Hey.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.320
Hey!

21:25.360 --> 21:26.950
Are you OK?

21:26.990 --> 21:29.200
You look like you're
lost or something.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.830
Sorry.

21:30.870 --> 21:33.540
Um, I just remembered
I have to be somewhere.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.580
Thank you again
for taking the time.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.340
[phone ringing]

21:50.100 --> 21:51.640
So much for staying out

21:51.680 --> 21:53.140
of each other's
phone records, huh?

21:53.180 --> 21:54.850
I believe you.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.440
You didn't hurt Gemma.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.520
But you did cover up the
evidence that you found.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.190
I told you

22:00.230 --> 22:02.270
I did it to protect you.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.610
Where did you put
the rags?

22:03.650 --> 22:05.240
The Dumpster,

22:05.280 --> 22:09.410
um, behind that new French
place on East 23rd. Why?

22:09.450 --> 22:11.870
I'm just trying
to make sure that you
covered your tracks.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.660
If the police identify
you as a suspect,

22:13.700 --> 22:15.450
then it's only
a matter of time

22:15.500 --> 22:17.330
before they connect us.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.790
I can't let that happen.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.920
[hip hop playing]

22:37.180 --> 22:39.060
[strained breathing]

22:44.650 --> 22:47.320
Agent Machado.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.860
MACHADO: The name,
uh, Malcolm Ward--

22:50.910 --> 22:52.870
does that mean
anything to you?

22:52.910 --> 22:55.740
-No.
-Sure?

22:55.790 --> 22:58.660
Friend of Bridget Kelly's?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.830
You remember
her, right?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.840
You choked one of
your dancers to death

23:03.880 --> 23:06.250
in front of her,
and then she was
supposed to testify

23:06.300 --> 23:09.010
against you in court,
but then she got cold feet

23:09.050 --> 23:10.260
and she took off.
You don't...

23:14.100 --> 23:18.140
Mr. Ward was reported missing
just a few days ago.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.850
And, uh, my colleague,
Detective Kemper, and I

23:20.890 --> 23:22.150
were just hoping
we could maybe take

23:22.190 --> 23:23.940
a look around,
see if he ended up here.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.730
-You got a warrant, chief?
-Why?

23:25.770 --> 23:27.570
You got something
to hide?

23:30.360 --> 23:31.530
Sorry.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.030
No warrant, no search.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.620
Feel free to stay
for the show.

23:34.660 --> 23:36.410
We'll even buy
you pales a dance.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.180
[sighs]
Look, for the last time,

23:53.220 --> 23:56.050
I did not start
the fight.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.100
It was...it was
that other girl Tessa.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.020
I'm sorry, Ms. Martin,
but that's

24:00.060 --> 24:01.690
not what I'm hearing
from the other students.

24:01.730 --> 24:06.020
You do get that today is
my first day here, right?

24:06.060 --> 24:07.770
You understand

24:07.820 --> 24:10.030
why I wouldn't have anyone
rushing to my defense.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.490
What's that?

24:15.530 --> 24:16.910
Your last school
was kind enough

24:16.950 --> 24:19.370
to pass along a file
they kept on you

24:19.410 --> 24:20.870
after you
enrolled here.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.420
Most people would call
this a permanent record.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.750
It reads to me
more like a rap sheet.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.750
This is not the first
time you've engaged

24:27.790 --> 24:29.550
in a physical
altercation, correct?

24:29.590 --> 24:31.210
-No, but--
-And you were expelled

24:31.260 --> 24:34.090
from your last school
because you were found

24:34.130 --> 24:36.050
in possession
of illegal narcotics.

24:36.090 --> 24:37.600
Yes, but that's--
[intercom beeps]

24:37.640 --> 24:39.560
Yes, Miss Lasky.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.190
-Mr. Martin's here to see you.
-Send him in.

24:43.230 --> 24:45.270
ANDREW: Thank you.

24:45.310 --> 24:46.770
Daddy, th--they're saying
I started a fight,

24:46.810 --> 24:48.020
but you know I--

24:48.060 --> 24:49.900
Mr. Martin, I thought
perhaps you and I

24:49.940 --> 24:51.190
should speak
in private.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.570
What? No! No!
I want to tell my dad

24:52.610 --> 24:53.820
-what really happened.
-Juliet.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.030
You heard what
the principal said.

24:56.070 --> 24:58.120
Wait for me outside.

24:59.740 --> 25:02.450
Oh, my God.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.620
You don't
believe me either.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.660
[indistinct shouting
in distance]

25:52.380 --> 25:54.210
WOMAN:
NYPD tip line.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.170
I read that these calls
are anonymous.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.880
Is that true?

25:57.930 --> 26:01.470
In that case, I'd like
to report someone missing.

26:01.510 --> 26:03.010
Gemma Butler.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.310
I think she was
the victim of foul play.

26:06.350 --> 26:09.270
And I can tell you where to
find the evidence to prove it.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.820
Taxi!

26:17.740 --> 26:19.410
OK, so how
much was it?

26:19.450 --> 26:21.580
[sighs]

26:24.490 --> 26:26.410
Henry Butler?

26:26.450 --> 26:27.910
Yes.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.040
I'm Detective Saldana.
This is Detective Towers.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.590
We were wondering
if your wife

26:31.630 --> 26:33.250
was available to
speak with us.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.010
Um, no, she isn't.

26:36.050 --> 26:38.800
She's actually...
she's been out all day.

26:40.470 --> 26:43.050
Is there
something wrong?

26:43.100 --> 26:44.560
Well, would you mind

26:44.600 --> 26:46.520
if we just came in
for a minute?

26:46.560 --> 26:48.940
We have a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

26:48.980 --> 26:50.980
Yeah, of course.

26:52.860 --> 26:54.360
I don't know. Um...

26:54.400 --> 26:56.820
I was asleep when Gemma
came home last night.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.200
And then she was gone
by the time I woke up.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.740
And are you aware that
she didn't show up

27:01.780 --> 27:02.950
at her place
of business today?

27:02.990 --> 27:04.580
Well, she's
an architect,

27:04.620 --> 27:06.540
so she works
a lot on-site.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.370
Heh. Uh...

27:09.410 --> 27:10.750
Detective,
I'm confused.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.170
Are you...are you
under the impression

27:12.210 --> 27:13.960
that something's
happened to my wife?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.460
We received an anonymous tip
about her a little while ago.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.670
The woman who called
seemed to think

27:16.710 --> 27:17.960
something
happened to her.

27:18.010 --> 27:20.680
-What?
-Mr. Butler,

27:20.720 --> 27:22.180
you wouldn't happen
to know anything

27:22.220 --> 27:24.720
about a bag full of rags
we recovered from a Dumpster

27:24.760 --> 27:27.640
behind a restaurant
on East 23rd, would you?

27:30.310 --> 27:33.190
Mr. Butler?

27:33.230 --> 27:34.980
No.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.780
I'm sorry.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.190
I have no idea

27:38.230 --> 27:39.740
what you guys
are talking about.

27:39.780 --> 27:41.280
SALDANA: Would you mind
if we continued this

27:41.320 --> 27:43.110
back at the precinct?

27:43.160 --> 27:44.990
I've got some photographs
I'd like you to look at.

27:57.090 --> 27:58.960
[phone ringing]

28:02.590 --> 28:04.140
Hello.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.470
CHARLIE: Hey.
Just checking in.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.770
You left that cafe
in a hurry.

28:09.810 --> 28:11.810
Uh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.140
I really appreciate

28:13.190 --> 28:14.730
you taking the time
to meet me.

28:14.770 --> 28:17.230
Anytime.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.740
Hey, if that offer's
still good,

28:24.780 --> 28:27.030
I'd like to take you
up on it.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.580
I want you to be
my new sponsor.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.620
All right.
Well, just one condition--

28:33.670 --> 28:36.040
it's got to be
a regular thing.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.250
Not just when you think
you need help.

28:38.290 --> 28:41.260
My schedule's been
a bit unpredictable.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.510
May I get back
to you on that?

28:43.550 --> 28:45.050
I don't know.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.260
Can I trust you not
to go back to that cafe,

28:47.300 --> 28:50.180
dig through the garbage,
and look for those drugs?

28:50.220 --> 28:52.680
Yeah, you can.

28:52.730 --> 28:56.480
Those are relics
of my old life.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.650
Today's about
protecting my new one.

29:07.870 --> 29:10.700
You're going to want
to get that to go.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.660
Just got off the phone
with my forensic guy.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.580
Turns out there was DNA
on those cigarette butts

29:14.620 --> 29:16.500
you found
this morning.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.210
CSU ran it through the
system, and they got a hit.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.090
Daniel Eknath.

29:20.130 --> 29:22.300
Is that name supposed
to mean something?

29:22.340 --> 29:24.880
No, but the face will.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.220
I'd say that's grounds
for a warrant. Wouldn't you?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.680
One of Bodaway's thugs.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.520
Hey.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.060
Loyal patrons of Club Caged,
I hold in my hand

29:38.100 --> 29:40.440
a warrant
to search the premises.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.860
If you don't want to risk
being caught up

29:41.900 --> 29:43.740
in a federal investigation,

29:43.780 --> 29:46.070
I strongly suggest
you take your leave now.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.950
-Kill the music.
-Get your tips later, honey.

29:47.990 --> 29:49.570
-Let's go.
-Take it easy.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.030
Drive safe.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.330
What the hell you think
you're doing here?

29:52.370 --> 29:53.870
MACHADO: You asked
for a warrant.

29:53.910 --> 29:55.620
Here it is. Spelled your
name right and everything.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.420
Where does this door lead?

30:03.460 --> 30:04.960
Basement.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.420
Strip club
with a basement.

30:06.470 --> 30:07.800
Oh, will wonders
never cease?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.470
Would you
open it, please?

30:09.510 --> 30:10.930
I lost the key.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.890
Oh, that's OK.
I brought mine.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.480
Just try to get
that done tonight, OK?

31:00.520 --> 31:01.980
Juliet.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.280
You OK?

31:07.320 --> 31:08.990
Never better.
I love it here.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.610
Think I may
even try out

31:10.660 --> 31:12.160
for the
cheerleading squad.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.160
Well, for what it's worth...

31:15.200 --> 31:18.080
I know what it's like
to be the new kid.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.420
My dad was in
the military.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.790
And whenever he got
restationed,

31:24.840 --> 31:27.880
well, I did, too.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.510
I lived in seven
different towns

31:29.550 --> 31:31.180
between grades
one and 12.

31:34.050 --> 31:36.510
He ever call you
a liar?

31:36.560 --> 31:38.640
Not that I can recall.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.230
Then you're one up
on me.

31:43.730 --> 31:47.530
Tessa said I started
the fight.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.740
The principal
believed her.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.820
So did my dad.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.700
I thought I could
take advantage

31:57.740 --> 31:59.450
of a "fresh start."

32:02.710 --> 32:05.710
But I guess I was
just kidding myself.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.010
[sniffles]

32:13.260 --> 32:16.220
Principal Caruso. I think
there's been some sort

32:16.260 --> 32:18.180
of mistake made with regard
to Ms. Martin here.

32:18.220 --> 32:19.640
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, she was just

32:19.680 --> 32:21.270
explaining to me she's
being reprimanded

32:21.310 --> 32:23.390
for the fight that broke out
in the hallway this afternoon.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.110
But the truth is, she's not
the one who started it.

32:26.150 --> 32:27.860
Tessa Banner did.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.820
-You know this for a fact?
-I was there.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.280
I saw the whole thing.

32:35.740 --> 32:36.910
I'd say you

32:36.950 --> 32:38.490
owe my daughter
an apology.

32:38.530 --> 32:39.870
Wouldn't you?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.920
[indistinct chatter]

32:52.220 --> 32:55.800
Know what's funny?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.010
I would've sworn

32:57.050 --> 32:58.510
I saw you come out
of your classroom

32:58.550 --> 33:00.220
after Tessa and I

33:00.260 --> 33:03.390
had already
started fighting.

33:03.430 --> 33:06.100
You didn't really see
who started it, did you?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.110
No. This is the second
time in two years

33:08.150 --> 33:10.320
I've had the pleasure of
Tessa Banner in my classroom.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.690
I know exactly what kind
of student she is.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.820
But you?

33:15.860 --> 33:17.570
Everyone deserves
a fresh start.

33:20.910 --> 33:22.540
Thanks.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.800
Can you identify
any of these items, sir?

33:30.840 --> 33:33.720
No. No, I can't.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.630
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.340
An anonymous woman calls you

33:38.390 --> 33:39.850
and tells you
where to find these things

33:39.890 --> 33:41.760
and says that they are
connected to my wife somehow,

33:41.810 --> 33:46.100
and you believe her?

33:46.140 --> 33:47.980
We--we don't even know
that Gemma is missing.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.520
All we know, Mr. Butler,
is that her car is gone

33:50.570 --> 33:52.030
and no one's been able
to reach her

33:52.070 --> 33:54.240
since 8:00 this morning.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.030
Don't you have to be missing
for, like, 24 hours

33:57.070 --> 33:59.070
before you're even
considered missing?

33:59.120 --> 34:00.780
TOWERS: Well,
now I'm confused,
Mr. Butler.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.370
Do you want us
to find your wife

34:02.410 --> 34:03.660
or don't you?

34:03.700 --> 34:04.950
Of course I do.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.830
I just--can you blame me

34:06.870 --> 34:08.790
for not wanting to believe
any of this?

34:08.830 --> 34:12.250
For hoping that this is some
sort of terrible mistake?

34:12.300 --> 34:13.590
Detective.

34:13.630 --> 34:15.470
Mr. Butler, will you
excuse us for a moment?

34:17.090 --> 34:19.590
MAN: Get him in a lineup
in the next 5-10.

34:29.810 --> 34:32.400
-OK. Thanks.
-Mr. Butler.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.190
[sniffles]

34:34.230 --> 34:37.280
We don't have
any more questions
for you today.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.360
But we appreciate you taking
the time to talk with us.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.660
I don't understand.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.530
I thought you said
we were going to be a while.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.410
I hope you'll call if you
hear from your wife.

34:46.450 --> 34:47.710
And if we hear anything

34:47.750 --> 34:49.120
on this end,
we'll let you know.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.960
Are you saying, um,
are you saying I can go?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.420
If we think of any
other questions,

34:54.460 --> 34:55.920
we'll let you know.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.720
[indistinct radio transmissions]

35:06.430 --> 35:10.440
So, we didn't
find Malcolm Ward.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.230
But at least we ruined
a slimeball's day.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.800
[cell phone ringing]

35:40.590 --> 35:42.640
-Agent Machado.
-Hey.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.470
This is Detective
Elizabeth Saldana, NYPD.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.600
I caught a potential
missing persons case today

35:47.640 --> 35:49.060
and found some fingerprints

35:49.100 --> 35:51.060
that might be
of interest to you.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.440
How do you figure?

35:52.480 --> 35:53.940
We ran them
through the system,

35:53.980 --> 35:55.270
and were able
to match them.

35:55.310 --> 35:58.480
Perp's file had
your contact info in it.

35:58.530 --> 36:01.110
I'm assuming the name
Bridget Kelly rings a bell?

36:12.330 --> 36:13.960
[elevator bell dings]

36:28.100 --> 36:31.850
You OK?

36:31.890 --> 36:33.940
I think you may
want to sit down.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.950
It's Gemma.

36:44.990 --> 36:48.120
It appears something may
have happened to her.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.290
I just got off
the phone with Henry.

36:53.330 --> 36:54.790
I don't have
all the details,

36:54.830 --> 36:56.330
but it seems that

36:56.380 --> 36:57.960
no one's seen
or heard from her

36:58.000 --> 37:00.960
since she
called me last night.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.510
I know you thought
she was taking time,

37:02.550 --> 37:04.880
but Henry says
the police have
reason to believe

37:04.930 --> 37:08.140
she was
a victim of foul play.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.770
I don't understand.
Are you saying...

37:16.810 --> 37:18.980
The only thing that's
certain at the moment

37:19.020 --> 37:21.070
is that she's missing.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.580
I'm sorry.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.210
I knew that
something was wrong.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.920
I just knew it.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.180
Olivia's expecting me
on a teleconference

37:46.220 --> 37:47.590
with Tokyo
in 20 minutes.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.800
I'm gonna call her and
ask her to reschedule.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.500
Hello.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.090
Agent Machado, Mrs. Martin.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.220
Uh, I'm sorry to bother
you at this hour,

38:26.260 --> 38:28.840
but I just heard
the news about Gemma Butler,

38:28.880 --> 38:32.140
and I just, uh, I wanted
to offer my sympathies.

38:32.180 --> 38:35.560
I know how--how close
the two of you are.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.640
Thank you.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.020
Can you think
of any reason

38:39.060 --> 38:43.150
why your sister
would want to hurt Gemma?

38:43.190 --> 38:45.030
Why in the world
would you ask me that?

38:45.070 --> 38:46.940
We found some fingerprints
that implicate Bridget

38:46.990 --> 38:48.610
in Gemma's disappearance.

38:48.650 --> 38:51.450
I'm out of town right now,
Mrs. Martin,

38:51.490 --> 38:55.450
but, um, I'm coming back
to New York in the morning.

38:55.490 --> 38:57.250
I'm sure I'll see you
real soon.
