00:10.567 --> 00:21.900
*

00:22.000 --> 00:23.633
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Shhhh!

00:23.733 --> 00:25.733
- Quiet. The whole world's
gonna know I missed curfew.

00:25.833 --> 00:29.200
It's gonna be your fault.
- I missed curfew, too.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.200
I was out trying to find a club
that would let my band play.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.867
- Oh, well, I missed curfew--
- Don't care!

00:33.967 --> 00:36.133
- Ow.

00:36.233 --> 00:37.667
Go check if
the coast is clear.

00:44.567 --> 00:45.933
- Mom is right on
the other side of that door

00:46.033 --> 00:48.133
with her "waiting up" blanket.

00:48.233 --> 00:50.433
We're in so much trouble.

00:50.533 --> 00:53.300
Why are a couple of supes
sneakin' around anyway?

00:53.400 --> 00:54.567
We should just man up,
go in there,

00:54.667 --> 00:57.633
and tell Mom what
we think of her "curfew."

00:57.733 --> 01:00.967
- You're right. We should handle
this like mature adults.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.333
Okay, Mom, I know
we're late, but--

01:07.433 --> 01:10.200
- Well...

01:17.267 --> 01:18.800
- Phoebe, you're over
an hour late.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.067
Do you know how worried
your father and I were?

01:21.133 --> 01:22.600
- HANK: Oh, television...

01:22.700 --> 01:25.300
I don't have a care in
the world when you're on.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.367
- Do you know how
worried I was?

01:35.533 --> 01:37.733
We shall not.

01:37.833 --> 01:39.867
Mom, here's the thing--

01:39.967 --> 01:41.367
I'm not a little
kid anymore.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.533
Heck, I'm the protector
of Hiddenville.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.700
If something went wrong,
I would call myself.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.367
- I know you think you can
take care of yourself,

01:49.467 --> 01:52.233
but I am still
responsible for you.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.733
Do you understand?
- Not even a little bit.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.067
So, I guess we'll
agree to disagree.

01:59.167 --> 02:01.867
- How about we agree to
ground you for a week?

02:01.967 --> 02:05.067
- Well, that
escalated quickly.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.533
Seriously

02:06.633 --> 02:09.300
- Yeah. Why don't you call
yourself and get outta that?

02:09.400 --> 02:10.900
- Come on, Mom!

02:11.067 --> 02:12.833
- Would you guys
please keep it down?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.733
I'm trying to sleep.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.300
- Sorry, sweetie.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.633
Phoebe, you're double-grounded
for waking your brother up.

02:18.733 --> 02:20.367
!

02:24.833 --> 02:26.967
- *

02:27.067 --> 02:28.233
* What you see

02:28.333 --> 02:29.700
* Is not what you get

02:29.800 --> 02:33.067
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:33.133 --> 02:34.767
* We fit right in

02:34.867 --> 02:36.233
* Bet you never guessed

02:36.333 --> 02:37.767
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:37.867 --> 02:39.367
* Just like all the rest

02:39.467 --> 02:41.100
* A picture
perfect family *

02:41.200 --> 02:43.233
* Is what we try to be

02:43.333 --> 02:44.400
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:44.500 --> 02:46.233
* The crazy things we do

02:46.333 --> 02:47.933
* This isn't
make believe *

02:48.067 --> 02:49.467
* It's our reality

02:49.567 --> 02:51.133
* Just your average family

02:51.233 --> 02:54.200
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:54.300 --> 02:57.833
* Livin' a double life *

03:02.467 --> 03:04.733
There's nothing on.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.933
Oh, Dad, do you need
anything from the store?

03:07.067 --> 03:08.433
I can go get it.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.800
- Shhhh! I can't be
seen talking to you.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.767
You're gonna get me grounded.
- Dad!

03:13.867 --> 03:17.067
- Sorry, honey, but the only way
you're gettin' outta here

03:17.100 --> 03:18.433
is on a superhero mission.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.400
Just, uh, watch some TV.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.567
TV's boring.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.533
Now you're bad

03:24.633 --> 03:26.700
You deserve being grounded.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.767
All I need's
a mission, huh?

03:31.867 --> 03:34.467
Thunder Monitor, emergency call
to President Kickbutt.

03:34.567 --> 03:37.767
- COMPUTER VOICE: Calling
Super President Kickbutt.

03:37.867 --> 03:40.367
- Phoebe, this had
better be important.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.933
I'm having quiet
time at home.

03:43.733 --> 03:47.067
- Simone, turn that
song off, please!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.833
- Uh, I was wondering
if you had a mission for me?

03:50.933 --> 03:53.667
- Phoebe, this is
my one day off a month.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.500
I just want some peace and--

03:57.100 --> 03:59.667
- Simone!

03:59.767 --> 04:03.333
- Oh, look, a mission
just came across the wire.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.700
The Hero League
wants you to

04:08.800 --> 04:12.267
take Simone off my hands
for the evening.

04:12.367 --> 04:13.933
- Oh, uh, that sounds--

04:14.067 --> 04:16.900
- Good. I'm sending
her to you right now.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.200
- Oh, hey, Phoebe!

04:20.400 --> 04:23.333
Mom, you can't
keep doing that!

04:23.433 --> 04:25.633
- You're Phoebe's mission now.

04:25.733 --> 04:29.067
Super President Kickbutt...
out...

04:30.500 --> 04:32.833
- I hope your parents
are cooler than mine.

04:32.933 --> 04:35.900
- They are not--which
is why we are leaving.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.567
- Oh, hey, Simone.
What are you doing here?

04:38.667 --> 04:40.067
- She's my "mission."

04:40.100 --> 04:42.100
Super President Kickbutt
wanted me to take her out.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.267
It sounded very serious--
there were beeps.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.367
Okay, well, you can go
on your little mission,

04:50.467 --> 04:52.333
but if you don't
make curfew tonight,

04:52.433 --> 04:54.100
you're gonna be
triple-grounded.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.233
Those are Max numbers.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.233
- Enjoy your mission.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.667
You're on "Mom Time" now.

05:05.067 --> 05:08.067
- Totally useless.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.667
Now wait here,
I'm gonna go put on

05:09.767 --> 05:11.867
this really cute outfit
she bought me yesterday.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.167
- Hi, Max.

05:16.267 --> 05:21.400
- Well, well, well,
if it isn't Simone Kickbutt--

05:21.500 --> 05:24.600
--er Cumberbatch.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.667
Guys, this is Simone,
a completely normal teenager

05:27.767 --> 05:30.733
whose parents are
totally unimportant.

05:30.833 --> 05:34.667
- Any relation to
Mike Kickbutter

05:34.767 --> 05:37.133
- No, no relation.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.233
So, what are you doing here?

05:39.333 --> 05:42.233
- She must have heard
about our first club gig--

05:42.333 --> 05:44.400
which we booked
just in time.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.533
We had a pact
that if we didn't

05:45.633 --> 05:48.333
play a club by tonight,
we'd break up.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.567
- Speaking of
breaking up, Max,

05:50.667 --> 05:53.733
is your mom still
with that dude?

05:57.067 --> 05:58.633
Not cool, Gideon.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.600
Wolfgang?

06:01.700 --> 06:03.400
- Sure, I'd love to
see you guys play.

06:05.367 --> 06:07.100
I've been to Germany.

06:08.833 --> 06:11.933
- Okay, uh, well, I just
texted you the address.

06:12.067 --> 06:16.067
- And I am definitely not
texting Barb the address.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.167
- You really seem to
be enjoying that cocoa.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.900
- Oh, I finished it
five minutes ago.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.833
I'm just trying
to wait them out.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.300
Okay, you win.
What's with the costumes?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.500
- It's not about
the costumes.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.900
We're here on business.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.133
- Yeah, it's o-fish-ial
business.

06:44.233 --> 06:47.167
- What this clown fish
is trying to say

06:47.267 --> 06:48.267
is we want a pet.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.833
- Oh.
- Oh, ho, here we go.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.700
You guys have tried this
song and dance before.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.833
- Not this one.
Hit it, Billy.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.300
- * Buy us a pet

06:56.400 --> 06:57.500
* Be the best guys ever

06:57.600 --> 06:58.700
- * Buy us a pet

06:58.800 --> 06:59.833
* It's meow or never

07:00.067 --> 07:01.400
- * What we're trying to say

07:01.500 --> 07:02.800
- * In our adorable way is

07:02.900 --> 07:05.800
- * Buy us a pet right now

07:08.500 --> 07:11.600
- BOTH:

07:11.700 --> 07:14.400
Nothing?

07:14.500 --> 07:18.467
- I'm sorry, but you guys are
just not ready for a pet...

07:18.567 --> 07:20.833
or Broadway.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.967
- That's right.
It's a huge responsibility.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.933
- We were afraid you
would say that,

07:25.067 --> 07:27.500
and we would like to
counter with this...

07:31.400 --> 07:33.267
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.
- Oh...

07:33.367 --> 07:36.900
- Must...fight...cuteness.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.833
- All right, listen,
why don't you guys

07:39.933 --> 07:42.533
take care of Dr. Colosso
for the weekend?

07:42.633 --> 07:44.467
If he says you're
responsible pet owners,

07:44.567 --> 07:47.500
then...we'll...get ya a pet.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.167
- NORA, BILLY, CHLOE:
Yay!

07:50.267 --> 07:52.400
- Sorry, Barb, but you
knew adorable children

07:52.500 --> 07:55.233
were a risk when
you married me.

07:58.067 --> 08:01.300
- Simone, I'm telling you,
Splatburger is not a club.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.833
It's barely a restaurant.

08:07.933 --> 08:10.300
- That is now a club.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.633
I can't believe Mrs. Wong

08:11.733 --> 08:13.767
would turn her restaurant
into a nightclub.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.667
- MAX: She didn't...

08:15.767 --> 08:18.300
I did!

08:18.400 --> 08:20.567
Welcome to Club Splatz.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.100
- Well, since I couldn't
find a club

08:24.200 --> 08:26.933
that would let our band play,
I opened my own,

08:27.067 --> 08:28.200
and when we rock out tonight,

08:28.300 --> 08:29.767
our band won't have
to split up.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.600
- So, you just broke
into Splatburger?

08:31.700 --> 08:34.800
How dare you!

08:34.900 --> 08:37.533
I stole the key.
- Hm...

08:37.633 --> 08:39.733
- You guys have fun now.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.300
- All right, we should go.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.300
Your mom would not like you
partying at an illegal club.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.233
- Yeah, because
she worries too much--

08:45.333 --> 08:46.900
just like your mom.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.067
- Tell me about it.
I'm triple

08:49.100 --> 08:50.833
I am a superhero, dang it.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.500
- Great! Then we're staying.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.267
Simone, out!

08:54.367 --> 08:55.800
- Wait!

08:55.900 --> 08:58.533
I can't miss curfew,
so meet me at the door at 10:00.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.733
- Got it. Now I'm out.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.533
- Okay, just please
don't hit me with your--

09:02.633 --> 09:04.200
hair.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.233
"And then
the wicked witch

09:09.333 --> 09:11.733
"put the pretty princess
to sleep forever and ever...

09:11.833 --> 09:13.933
The End."?

09:14.067 --> 09:17.267
- Ha! I love evil
fairytales.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.633
- Enjoy your healthy
vegetables, Colosso.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.633
- Well, isn't that lovely.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.833
Huh!

09:26.933 --> 09:28.333
- I don't want that garbage!

09:28.433 --> 09:31.367
I want deep-dish pizza
from Chicago.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.133
- Bunny food only.

09:33.233 --> 09:36.467
We have to show mom and dad
we're responsible pet owners.

09:36.567 --> 09:37.733
- Fine.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.900
Hank! Barb!

09:40.067 --> 09:41.733
The kids are starving me!

09:41.833 --> 09:43.967
- Okay, if we get
you what you want,

09:44.067 --> 09:46.067
will you say we're
good pet owners?

09:46.100 --> 09:49.700
- I don't make any promises
'til I see the goods.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.467
- Oh, yeah!

09:55.567 --> 09:57.067
Let's do this!

09:59.833 --> 10:02.800
- How does his little
mouth open so wide?

10:06.833 --> 10:08.767
- Uh...

10:08.867 --> 10:11.500
I think I'm a tad bloated.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.800
You're a bunny blimp.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.733
- Guess I can't process
cheese like I used to.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.600
Good to know.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.833
- Have any of you
guys seen Simone?

10:23.933 --> 10:25.867
She was supposed to
meet me by the door,

10:25.967 --> 10:27.533
but I can't find her.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.900
- Did you check Club Splatz's
Velvet Members Only VIP Room?

10:32.033 --> 10:34.867
- And that's why
you'll never be a member.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.133
- I tried to get in, but that
guy won't let me past.

10:38.233 --> 10:41.633
- That's because you're not
a very important person.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.567
You're a very...
annoying person.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.067
And that group's over there.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.633
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:53.733 --> 10:56.167
She's with me, Enrico.

10:56.267 --> 10:58.767
Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:58.867 --> 11:01.900
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:02.067 --> 11:04.067
- Oh, there she is...

11:06.167 --> 11:08.800
- ...throwing a chicken
up the garbage chute.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.967
Bye-bye, birdie!

11:14.233 --> 11:15.633
I waited at the door
for like 20 minutes.

11:15.733 --> 11:18.333
- Oh, well, I was just having
so much fun with this

11:18.433 --> 11:21.567
that I suddenly didn't care
that you were waiting.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.767
- Well, we're going.
I don't wanna miss curfew.

11:23.867 --> 11:25.267
- You can go. I'm staying.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.100
- I'm not leaving
you here mid-mission.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.067
I have to make sure
you get home safe.

11:32.467 --> 11:33.533
Oh, real mature.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.167
- BOTH: Nya!

11:35.267 --> 11:37.400
- Okay, you two are
outta here.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.767
I'm gettin' complaints--

11:38.867 --> 11:40.333
mostly from me.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.233
But you're killin' the vibe
in the VIP Room.

11:42.333 --> 11:46.267
- Okay, it's a kitchen with
a garbage hole in the ceiling.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.633
It's time to go, Missy.

11:49.733 --> 11:51.567
Pu-lease.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.300
I'm not going anywhere.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.067
- Ho, ho.

12:02.167 --> 12:05.200
That's what the sign meant.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.500
- SIMONE:
What do you think?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.067
- This is awful.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.767
How am I gonna get her
back and make curfew?

12:17.867 --> 12:20.367
- You know who you should talk
to about this problem?

12:20.467 --> 12:22.433
Anyone but me.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.267
- Wait. You have to help
me get Simone back.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.100
- Well, I've gotta
go play this gig.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.067
Me and my band
can stay together

12:28.100 --> 12:29.867
and become legendary
bad boy rockers.

12:29.967 --> 12:33.333
One question--
collar up or down?

12:33.433 --> 12:35.367
- You know, I, uh, sure would
hate for Mom to find out

12:35.467 --> 12:37.467
you broke into Splatburger
and turned it into a club.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.667
- Pfft, you think telling
on me's gonna work?

12:39.767 --> 12:41.333
- Call Mom.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.233
- Stop that!

12:43.333 --> 12:44.967
- Okay, let's make
this quick.

12:45.067 --> 12:47.167
Oh, there's a reverse lever.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.333
- Uh, okay, uh, I will pull
it with my telekinesis

12:50.433 --> 12:52.433
and when this thing spits
Simone out, we'll catch her.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.133
- Yeah.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.167
- Here she comes.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.467
I accept your trade,
trash chute.

13:12.967 --> 13:16.067
- COLOSSO:

13:16.133 --> 13:17.633
- Sorry, Colosso,

13:17.733 --> 13:19.867
but we can't let Mom
and Dad see you like this,

13:19.967 --> 13:21.100
or we'll never get a pet.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.433
- We have to cover you
up until we figure out

13:22.533 --> 13:25.567
how to fix...this.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.067
Ah, relax. Nobody
ever comes down here.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.333
- BARB: Kids, we're
coming down there.

13:33.633 --> 13:36.467
- Hey, we just came down
to check on you guys.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.700
- Yeah, Colosso,
how are they doing?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.467
- Don't. He's asleep.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.067
- And as responsible
pet owners,

13:42.100 --> 13:44.867
we can't let you disturb
his peace and quiet.

13:44.967 --> 13:47.900
- COLOSSO:

13:48.067 --> 13:51.233
- Uh, that was me.
My tummy's bubbly.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.200
- Aw, well, come on, sweetie.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.367
Let's fix up your tummy
with a little ginger tea.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.600
You owe me.

14:07.067 --> 14:10.233
- How do we fix your tummy,
bubble boy?

14:10.333 --> 14:11.633
- We need to force
out this gas

14:11.733 --> 14:15.100
by filling me up with
more fart fuel.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.500
So we should
give you more gas?

14:17.600 --> 14:20.633
I thought my body
was confusing.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.567
- Just bring me beans--

14:22.667 --> 14:23.833
and lots of 'em.

14:31.133 --> 14:34.600
- Okay, you kids know
the drill.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.100
- SIMONE: Are you
guys still there?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.533
- Uh, yeah.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.533
Uh, Phoebe and I are
just trying to find

14:45.633 --> 14:48.100
a way to get you out
of wherever you are.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.900
Founden Maxen.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.533
- There you are, bro.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.800
What are you doing in here?
We've gotta play.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.600
- Yeah, much like my love life,
this club is "one night only."

14:58.700 --> 15:02.467
- Dude, your love life
is "no night only."

15:02.567 --> 15:04.500
- Look, guys,
I just need a second.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.667
In the meantime, do something
entertaining until I get there.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.067
- Wolfgang!

15:08.167 --> 15:09.800
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

15:09.900 --> 15:11.567
Huh!

15:14.300 --> 15:17.733
- Hey, someone in
your band is talented.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.533
All right, I searched
the whole restaurant

15:19.633 --> 15:21.200
and I can't figure out where
this garbage chute leads.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.800
- All right, new plan.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.067
You are gonna go up
there to get Simone,

15:26.133 --> 15:27.767
and I'm gonna pull
you guys out.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.867
- Why don't you go up the chute
and I pull you out?

15:29.967 --> 15:31.400
- Because I come
with friends--

15:31.500 --> 15:34.267
"Venus" and "Serena"!

15:34.367 --> 15:36.600
Make like that sign
and stand on the "X."

15:40.533 --> 15:46.067
- Max, do not...let go...
of the cord.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.833
- Don't worry. We won't.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.567
Don't give up, Venus!

15:59.667 --> 16:01.800
Don't...

16:01.900 --> 16:04.200
Whoa!

16:04.300 --> 16:06.433
- PHOEBE: Oh!
- MAX: Whoa!

16:15.067 --> 16:16.833
I didn't let go of the cord.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.533
- Hey, guys, do you
want some tea?

16:21.633 --> 16:25.300
We had cookies,
but Chloe ate them all.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.300
- There's no crumbs
on my face.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.500
- What's Colosso
doing up here?

16:33.600 --> 16:36.600
- Mom, Dad, we need
your help.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.367
Look...

16:41.400 --> 16:43.267
- COLOSSO: No...

16:43.367 --> 16:45.433
...don't look at me.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.300
- We really tried to
be good pet owners.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.067
- Honey, I think
you failed.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.700
- Oh, this is it,
I'm gonna blow!

16:57.767 --> 17:00.533
Oh...oh...oh...

17:00.633 --> 17:02.100
Ahh!

17:02.200 --> 17:03.767
- Take cover!

17:13.200 --> 17:15.333
Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:15.433 --> 17:17.367
Ow!

17:17.467 --> 17:20.067
- ALL: Ohhh!!

17:23.067 --> 17:24.633
- Whew!

17:24.733 --> 17:27.067
- All right, nobody light
a match for at least an hour.

17:29.433 --> 17:32.067
- Yeah, we don't want
a pet anymore.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.500
- There's no door
down there.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.667
But I did find
another burger.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.167
- Great. We're trapped
in here.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.267
- Wait, you losers
can give up,

17:47.367 --> 17:50.067
but I'm playing
my club gig tonight.

17:58.633 --> 18:01.133
- Well, Simone,
I hope you're happy.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.900
I'm gonna be picking pork scraps
outta my super heels for a week.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.700
- None of this would
have happened

18:06.800 --> 18:08.500
if you had just met me
at the door on time.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.800
I was worried sick about you.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.067
- "Kobe," "LeBron,"
get in the game!

18:15.367 --> 18:18.167
I've gotta get up...
just a little higher.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.900
Whew.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.467
- Look, Simone, I know you think
you can take care of yourself,

18:26.567 --> 18:29.400
but I'm the one who's
responsible for you.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.700
Wait. Where have
I heard this before?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.200
- Blah, blah, blah,
blabbity, blah, blah,

18:34.300 --> 18:36.500
still responsible for you.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.100
- Oh, that's where
I heard it.

18:43.733 --> 18:44.933
- The walls are closing in.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.467
- The room must be
a giant trash compactor.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.467
It's gonna smash us
into a brick of trash.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.467
- Haven't I been
through enough?

18:51.567 --> 18:54.467
And you guys, too.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.800
- We've gotta get up through
that hole in the ceiling.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.500
- As my mad hops have
already proven--

19:00.600 --> 19:03.300
it's way too high up.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.933
- Not for someone
with Kickbutt power.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.500
Simone can superkick
us straight up

19:07.600 --> 19:08.933
through the hole
in the ceiling.

19:09.067 --> 19:11.167
If we're all tied together,
we'll all fly up together.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.367
- I'm in.
I love kicking butts.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.967
- Here, Max, tie this
cord around yourself.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.067
- Okay.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.467
- Good. Now let Simone
kick you in the butt.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.600
No!
Why can't she kick you?

19:21.700 --> 19:24.167
- Because it hurts.

19:24.267 --> 19:25.400
- Well, she's not
kicking me.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.400
- I'll choose.
Eeeny, meeny, miny--

19:27.500 --> 19:29.600
kick butt!

19:36.233 --> 19:38.267
- Why does that
cord hate me?

19:41.333 --> 19:43.467
- BOTH:

19:46.433 --> 19:48.167
- We did it!

19:48.267 --> 19:50.967
Oh, and I can't
feel my butt.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.800
Wait, now I can.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.867
Ow!

19:56.967 --> 19:59.800
- MAX: Help!
I'm being smooshed!

19:59.900 --> 20:01.533
- Oh, no, Max!

20:03.667 --> 20:05.733
- It came from
the alley outside.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.500
- MAX: I don't see
what's so funny.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.467
Can you see it now?

20:20.367 --> 20:21.533
- Get outta my way.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.267
I'm still doin' my gig.

20:23.367 --> 20:24.667
You can't stop
rock 'n roll.

20:24.767 --> 20:27.667
You can squish it into a dirty
little cube of trash,

20:27.767 --> 20:30.200
but you can't stop it.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.700
- All right,
I can still make curfew,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.433
so, now are you ready to go?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.100
- Yeah.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
You shouldn't have brought me

20:36.300 --> 20:37.667
to this illegal club
in the first place.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.967
What were you thinking?

20:44.867 --> 20:46.567
Get those box cutters you
call elbows over here

20:46.667 --> 20:49.133
and get me outta
this thing.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.600
- Whoaaaa!

20:53.267 --> 20:56.233
You're banned from
Club Splatz!

20:58.600 --> 21:01.267
- See you later, Simone.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.733
Never again.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.500
- Well, you're home.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.333
No groundings
tonight, blankie.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.067
- Mom, I'm really sorry I broke
curfew the other night.

21:11.167 --> 21:12.700
I should have respected
your wishes

21:12.800 --> 21:14.133
and come home on time.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.867
- Aw, thank you.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.767
So, does that mean you're never
gonna break curfew again?

21:18.867 --> 21:22.067
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.967
But I promise I'll call,
if I'm gonna be late.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.833
- Aw, good enough.

21:25.933 --> 21:29.567
- Mom O'Clock.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.933
Max is officially
late for curfew.

21:32.067 --> 21:33.700
Do you have any idea
where he is?

21:33.800 --> 21:37.167
- As a matter
of fact, I do.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.067
- Not sure that counts
as playin', bro.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.633
- It counts.
The band stays together.

21:56.133 --> 21:58.533
I see you came alone.

21:58.633 --> 22:02.200
- I'm grounding your lead
singer for a long time.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.300
- Keep playin', guys.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.467
You can't ground
rock 'n roll.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.633
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:11.200 --> 22:27.067
- *
