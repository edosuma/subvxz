00:00.008 --> 00:02.580
Okay, so this is what
happened last time on Star.

00:02.605 --> 00:05.790
Carlotta Brown from Mixed Harmony!

00:05.814 --> 00:08.415
- How long has it been?
- Too long.

00:09.125 --> 00:11.913
Refute the demons inside this child.

00:11.938 --> 00:13.594
You set me up.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.843
Oh, hell no, Jahil, she can't stay here.

00:17.868 --> 00:20.614
Regardless of what you
think, I like your son,

00:20.639 --> 00:23.104
and I'm gonna fix whatever
it is you messed up in him.

00:23.139 --> 00:24.539
If you're lucky, they'll
offer you a plea deal

00:24.607 --> 00:26.240
with a minimum of five years.

00:26.309 --> 00:27.642
Somebody uploaded a video of you

00:27.710 --> 00:29.377
singing with the girls at the rally.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.919
I'm expanding our audience.

00:30.944 --> 00:32.217
I'm adding Eva to the group.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.436
Hey, hey, hey!

00:34.461 --> 00:36.323
What's it gonna be, Eva or Star?

00:36.348 --> 00:37.981
I got to go with Star.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.180
But I can't shake the
feeling we're one mistake away

I like what I'm seeing.

03:09.926 --> 03:12.329
Simone, other than you coming
in early at that one place,

03:12.398 --> 03:14.164
I-I think it's looking really good.

03:14.233 --> 03:17.425
Hell, you keep this up, you might
even be one of the final five.

03:17.450 --> 03:18.566
All right, I'm gonna
make some phone calls.

03:18.604 --> 03:19.870
Why don't y'all take a minute,

03:19.939 --> 03:21.572
come back and take it
from the top, all right?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.621
You got to be kidding me.

03:23.652 --> 03:25.442
We just danced in a chair.

03:25.477 --> 03:27.379
Go get some water, you'll be all right.

03:29.229 --> 03:31.511
- And I wasn't early.
- Yes, you were.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.745
What about me?

03:35.083 --> 03:36.783
What about you?

03:36.808 --> 03:39.189
You know you're good. You
don't need me telling you.

03:39.258 --> 03:41.391
So that's how it's gonna be?

03:42.003 --> 03:43.611
How's that?

03:43.636 --> 03:45.228
Ignoring me.

03:45.737 --> 03:47.998
Dismissing me, acting
like I'm not even here,

03:48.067 --> 03:50.112
when you're clearly obsessed.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.292
The only reason you shacked up
with that ho in the first place...

03:54.607 --> 03:57.174
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
to call your niece a ho...

03:57.199 --> 03:58.942
is 'cause I'm with Hunter.

03:59.011 --> 04:00.844
Just admit it already.

04:00.913 --> 04:02.890
For the record, the only
one I was obsessed with

04:02.915 --> 04:04.554
was your mother, not you.

04:04.579 --> 04:05.905
You?

04:06.103 --> 04:07.776
I thought you might be
a good ride in the sack,

04:07.820 --> 04:10.093
but Hunter said you ain't even that.

04:46.270 --> 04:47.678
Can you believe Ms. Armstrong

04:47.703 --> 04:50.389

04:50.414 --> 04:53.289
I'm just getting her hair to
grow back from that other place.

04:53.930 --> 04:56.805
C, how come you didn't
tell me somebody got killed?

04:59.351 --> 05:02.027
So we holding tea from each other.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.631
Police come around
here asking questions,

05:05.700 --> 05:08.523
ain't no telling what you gonna
say with your big-ass mouth.

05:08.778 --> 05:10.694
And you wearing stolen clothes.

05:10.771 --> 05:12.071

05:16.647 --> 05:18.888

05:18.913 --> 05:21.180
I know one thing: we need
another receptionist around here.

05:21.248 --> 05:23.182
Since Cotton been gone, it's been crazy.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.651
My book's been all over the place.

05:26.171 --> 05:28.687
I'm doing the best I can as a mother.

05:28.756 --> 05:30.663
Am I blaming you?

05:31.812 --> 05:34.193
Cotton is very well aware
of the streets, honey.

05:34.655 --> 05:36.962
Yeah, but I don't want her
to find out the way I did.

05:37.031 --> 05:38.797
Cotton been found out.

05:38.866 --> 05:40.766
I'm so sorry to tell you.

05:40.835 --> 05:43.279
She'll be back home. I
give that bitch a week.

05:43.304 --> 05:44.984
Ain't nobody finna
deal with her that long.

05:48.077 --> 05:50.941
Oh, here go that little Latin

05:54.048 --> 05:55.347
Well, can you clean up tonight?

05:55.416 --> 05:57.580
Those girls are
rehearsing for that thing.

05:57.605 --> 05:58.808
Yeah.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.053
What happened to your face?

06:01.301 --> 06:02.582
Nothing.

06:04.295 --> 06:05.511
What happened?

06:06.812 --> 06:08.278
Star.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.562
She got mad I was in the group.

06:10.598 --> 06:13.619
So... she made Jahil choose.

06:15.136 --> 06:16.235

06:39.624 --> 06:42.308
Excuse me. Hey, y'all, sorry I'm late.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.333
I was trying to finish up the
last touches on these jumpers.

06:45.376 --> 06:47.497
Michelle hates it when I sew.

06:47.522 --> 06:48.529
- You like it?
- Cotton, Cotton.

06:48.554 --> 06:50.991
- What's up, what's up, baby? Come on.
- What you on?

06:51.016 --> 06:52.749
Just a little Molly.

06:52.774 --> 06:54.841
Cotton, you look a damn mess.

06:55.139 --> 06:57.366
But-but I feel good.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.239
High as hell and can
still sew your ass off.

07:00.264 --> 07:02.288
Girls, can I talk to you?

07:02.356 --> 07:04.668
- What's wrong with you?
- Tell 'em.

07:04.693 --> 07:06.379
Uh, I think it's best coming from you.

07:06.404 --> 07:08.641
Jahil, what's going on?

07:09.457 --> 07:10.496
Ladies, hi.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.567
I'm Van Evans from Atlanta NextFest.

07:12.592 --> 07:13.691
Hi.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.334
Hi.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.143
I was just explaining to your manager

07:17.168 --> 07:19.700
that we don't allow for
any last-minute changes.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.508
Wait, what's that s-supposed to mean?

07:25.736 --> 07:28.746
I signed y'all up as a, as
a... as a four-girl group.

07:28.771 --> 07:31.127
- When?
- I told you that last week, Star.

07:31.152 --> 07:32.715
I told all of you I was gonna add Eva,

07:32.740 --> 07:34.773
to-to add a Latin flavor.

07:35.096 --> 07:37.330
I-I put it in writing
with the Atlanta NextFest.

07:37.355 --> 07:39.168
Then you need to unwrite it.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.425
I'm sorry, guys.

07:40.529 --> 07:42.223
Okay? That's why I came by personally.

07:42.248 --> 07:44.306
When Jahil mentioned he
wanted it back to a trio,

07:44.331 --> 07:46.564
I had to let him know it's over my head.

07:46.908 --> 07:48.174
It's done.

07:48.963 --> 07:50.799
Get back to me with
how you want to proceed.

07:50.824 --> 07:52.831
I need to know by the
end of day tomorrow.

07:52.891 --> 07:55.024
- Wait, homeboy, come back.
- So we're about to get dropped

07:55.069 --> 07:57.525
from this competition
off of a technicality?

07:57.550 --> 07:58.752
Are you kidding me?

07:58.777 --> 08:01.221
Jahil, I swear to God,
if you do not fix this,

08:01.246 --> 08:03.150
I will call my father
and he will bury you.

08:03.175 --> 08:04.407
We can fix it, all right?

08:04.432 --> 08:05.898
- How?
- Put her back in.

08:05.923 --> 08:07.221
Hell no.

08:07.246 --> 08:09.815
- What other choice we got?
- You are unbelievable.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.104
How are we supposed to do anything good

08:11.129 --> 08:12.909
if you're sitting here
changing the group dynamic

08:12.934 --> 08:14.252
every five minutes?

08:14.277 --> 08:16.627
We've been a trio this
entire competition.

08:16.652 --> 08:19.244
You heard the man.
Their rules, not mine.

08:19.653 --> 08:21.886
You know what, I'm really tired

08:21.911 --> 08:23.385
of hearing your excuses!

08:23.410 --> 08:25.577
- Star... Hey!
- I'm tired! I'm tired!

08:25.602 --> 08:27.432
You want to forfeit this whole thing?!

08:27.457 --> 08:29.179
'Cause if you want to do
that, that's what we can do!

08:29.204 --> 08:30.921
All that hard work right down the drain!

08:30.946 --> 08:32.842
- I don't care!
- Oh, my God!

08:32.868 --> 08:36.370
Ugh! Yo! Y'all-y'all is blowing my high!

08:38.126 --> 08:39.905
Take me home.

08:42.653 --> 08:45.294
I said I'm high! Take me home!

08:45.512 --> 08:47.212
Let's go, Cotton.

08:49.055 --> 08:51.411
You three, decide.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.789
He's right.

08:59.030 --> 09:02.063
We have to add Eva back in,
if we want to stay in this.

09:02.088 --> 09:03.422
I'm not asking her back.

09:03.447 --> 09:04.633
If we win this thing,

09:04.658 --> 09:06.188
we can write our own ticket.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.745
And get a new manager.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.737
We have come too far
to let this slip away.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.995
You know that's not
his niece, right, Alex?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.445
They're sleeping together.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.204
And the bitch speaks perfect English.

09:17.229 --> 09:18.380
Better than me.

09:18.405 --> 09:20.396
Okay, well, so what, Star?

09:20.421 --> 09:22.426
You know what, you
dragged me into this dream,

09:22.451 --> 09:24.416
and now I want it
just as much as you do.

09:24.441 --> 09:27.309
So get up off your ass,
let's go talk to Eva,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.400
and let's win this competition.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.991
She should still be working.
Let's just get this over with.

09:34.016 --> 09:35.782
Can't even believe I'm doing this.

09:36.452 --> 09:39.094
She's not about to get
any input on wardrobe,

09:39.119 --> 09:40.830
choreography, songs... nothing.

09:40.855 --> 09:43.009
- Okay, all right, just chill.
- This is our group...

09:43.034 --> 09:45.720
I cannot believe I fell
for that niece story.

09:45.973 --> 09:48.703
I wasn't expecting y'all
back for another hour.

09:48.728 --> 09:50.775
- How was rehearsal?
- Where's Eva?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.466
She left a little while ago. Why?

09:52.491 --> 09:53.924
Long story.

09:54.090 --> 09:55.956
Okay, well, dinner's on the stove.

09:55.981 --> 09:57.744
Simone, eat.

09:57.886 --> 09:59.559
Then I'm gonna take you
to your recovery meeting.

09:59.584 --> 10:00.683
Okay.

10:01.384 --> 10:03.775
Stop acting like a alley cat, Star.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.577
I don't even know what I did.

10:05.645 --> 10:06.798
Where are you going?

10:06.823 --> 10:09.157
To talk Derek out of
using his public defender.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.626
I thought you conned your mother
into getting him a real lawyer.

10:11.651 --> 10:13.602
Yeah, well, Miss Ruby had other ideas.

10:13.627 --> 10:15.587
Hmm, Miss Ruby always does.

10:15.619 --> 10:16.868
I'm sorry, dude.

10:16.893 --> 10:18.626
All right, well, if
Eva's not here, I'm out.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.227
I'll see y'all at
rehearsal in the morning.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.173
Hey, no later than 10:00 tomorrow, Star.

10:22.198 --> 10:24.313
We can try convincing her then.

10:24.712 --> 10:26.151
I'm sure you'll spend all night

10:26.176 --> 10:28.076
trying to convince her, Uncle Jahil.

10:29.627 --> 10:31.836
You're not sleeping
with that girl, are you?

10:31.871 --> 10:34.065
What? No.

10:34.932 --> 10:36.551
Yeah, okay.

10:37.174 --> 10:39.777
Hey, uh, Lottie, you got a minute?

10:39.846 --> 10:41.916
If you got problems with them
girls, I'm not gonna intervene.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.353
That's between you and them.

10:43.378 --> 10:45.807
No, it's, uh... it's Cotton.

10:46.876 --> 10:48.116
What?

10:48.916 --> 10:51.041
I don't know. She ain't, uh...

10:51.293 --> 10:53.151
she ain't been acting right.

10:53.326 --> 10:55.326
I'm worried about her.

10:55.395 --> 10:57.252
You don't get to worry about her.

10:57.277 --> 10:59.130
Look, she's a good kid.

10:59.323 --> 11:02.834
But I know she's had some problems
with drugs in the-in the past.

11:02.902 --> 11:05.409
I just wanted you to know before
whatever she's going through

11:05.434 --> 11:06.604
gets out of hand.

11:06.673 --> 11:07.805
That's it.

11:07.830 --> 11:10.643
Cotton is my business, not yours.

11:11.426 --> 11:13.362
Now, get out of here.

11:15.465 --> 11:16.970
Night, Lottie.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:26.893 --> 11:29.430
I don't care if it's a public defender.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.695
If he's gonna go to trial,

11:30.764 --> 11:32.478
it's gonna be with a black attorney.

11:32.503 --> 11:33.769
And that's that.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.700
But thank you, baby.

11:35.735 --> 11:37.150
Miss Ruby.

11:37.907 --> 11:40.430
This is your life we're talking about.

11:40.573 --> 11:43.399
- A public defender? Really?
- I know, baby.

11:43.555 --> 11:46.164
And I'm grateful Moses got
me out, don't get me wrong,

11:46.189 --> 11:48.346
but I am not taking your parents' money.

11:48.415 --> 11:50.281
You got that right.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.650
What were you saying about
the surveillance footage?

11:52.719 --> 11:54.804
Moses only relied on police reports.

11:54.829 --> 11:56.963
He never subpoenaed any
of the surveillance cameras

11:56.988 --> 11:58.493
in the surrounding area.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.264
Okay, so there could
be surveillance footage

12:00.289 --> 12:02.804
of the protest before stuff got crazy.

12:02.829 --> 12:05.389
Wouldn't the cops have used
that for their own investigation?

12:05.414 --> 12:06.905
That's what I plan to find out.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.600
And if they did, the question
is: why haven't they shared it?

12:09.669 --> 12:11.389
We all know why...

12:11.711 --> 12:14.272
if there's nothing there pointing
in my direction, they'd look stupid.

12:14.340 --> 12:15.673
With that kind of evidence,

12:15.742 --> 12:17.966
we could possibly get
all charges dropped,

12:17.991 --> 12:20.491
and you could get back to your life.

12:20.860 --> 12:23.233
It's a long shot, but it's a start.

12:24.184 --> 12:26.551
- Keep a low pro till then.
- Yes, sir.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.590
Hey, wait, wait. Hold
on, hold on. My neck.

12:32.615 --> 12:34.952
You're too big for this.

12:37.241 --> 12:38.756
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

12:38.781 --> 12:40.116
Ow!

12:40.336 --> 12:42.553
It's not funny.

12:43.136 --> 12:44.561
God!

12:44.886 --> 12:47.587
Why are we making out in a
car when you have a house?

12:47.612 --> 12:49.475
This is not high school.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.353
Well, let's...

12:55.837 --> 12:57.642
try something a little different.

12:58.518 --> 12:59.970
Okay, we can try something different

12:59.995 --> 13:02.630
in a really comfy king-sized bed.

13:02.655 --> 13:04.155
That'd be great.

13:05.824 --> 13:07.784
Well, let's go to the Four Seasons.

13:10.558 --> 13:13.059
Why? I'm a whore now?

13:13.299 --> 13:14.847
What? No!

13:14.872 --> 13:16.324
Excuse me.

13:16.369 --> 13:18.416
- No, where'd you get that? Hey, hey.
- What do you think this is?

13:18.441 --> 13:21.075
- Hey, where'd you get that from?
- Why are we here?

13:22.485 --> 13:24.557
Oh, my God, your mother?

13:25.534 --> 13:28.018
Really? How am I the teenager
and I'm dealing with your mama?

13:28.043 --> 13:29.932
I'm just tired of listening to
you two arguing all the time.

13:29.957 --> 13:31.471
So grow a pair.

13:32.443 --> 13:34.479
- With you or her?
- Both.

13:36.784 --> 13:37.964
I get it, babe.

13:37.989 --> 13:39.479
Y'all are close.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.597
It's Norman Bates creepy,

13:41.622 --> 13:42.938
but I get it.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.411
But she needs to learn to
stay on her side of the house,

13:47.436 --> 13:49.002
just like I stay on mine.

13:49.293 --> 13:51.497
- That's it.
- Okay, so, what?

13:53.450 --> 13:55.497
So you want to go back to the house?

13:55.621 --> 13:56.716
Okay.

14:01.901 --> 14:03.233
Really?

14:09.976 --> 14:11.569
You agree?

14:11.758 --> 14:14.225
Would I be here if I didn't?

14:14.379 --> 14:17.195
I hate you just as much as you hate me.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.426
Told you guys she was adorable.

14:19.451 --> 14:21.918
Star, you promised.

14:21.943 --> 14:23.542
And I'm gonna keep my promise.

14:23.828 --> 14:25.828
I just want to break it down
for her so she understands

14:25.853 --> 14:27.992
that this is the best
deal she's ever gonna get.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.438
- May I?
- Sure.

14:29.463 --> 14:30.586
So it turns out your
sugar daddy over there...

14:30.611 --> 14:31.787
My uncle.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.469
Right.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.358
When you manipulated your uncle

14:35.383 --> 14:36.981
into letting you sing at the protest...

14:37.006 --> 14:38.516
I saved your ass.

14:38.759 --> 14:41.946
... he made us into a foursome
for some unknown reason.

14:41.971 --> 14:43.720
So now Atlanta NextFest

14:43.745 --> 14:45.679
is expecting a four-girl group.

14:45.704 --> 14:46.991
There was a deadline.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.456
Whoever was listed as part
of the group at the time

14:49.481 --> 14:51.782
makes up the group going forward.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.328
So you can't perform without me.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.841
Oh, and she's a genius. Yes.

14:56.866 --> 14:59.031
And you can't get your
foot in the door without us.

14:59.056 --> 15:00.274
And yes, you're part of the group.

15:00.299 --> 15:01.765
Can we start rehearsing now, or what?

15:01.790 --> 15:03.575
She's willing to play nice if you are.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.938
So can we wrap this ego-fest up, please?

15:05.963 --> 15:08.063
We're handing you everything
you never worked for

15:08.088 --> 15:10.296
on a silver platter... you're welcome.

15:10.321 --> 15:12.647
Okay. So decision made.

15:12.672 --> 15:15.186
We are now a four-girl group.

15:15.255 --> 15:17.198
And we need a new song, like, yesterday.

15:17.223 --> 15:19.357
So do you want to keep
beefing or get this money?

15:19.382 --> 15:20.948
The choice is yours.

15:22.151 --> 15:23.452
So, you know, given our history,

15:23.477 --> 15:26.202
I-I just want to take the time to say...

15:26.227 --> 15:28.656
I appreciate you seeing me right now,

15:28.681 --> 15:30.270
Pumpkin. So thank you.

15:30.308 --> 15:32.741
You were gonna keep blowing
up my phone if I didn't.

15:33.624 --> 15:34.687
What you want?

15:34.712 --> 15:36.929
There's something I been
working on for a long while now,

15:36.954 --> 15:38.523
but I need a producer like you

15:38.548 --> 15:40.335
to help me break it down
to a four-part harmony,

15:40.360 --> 15:41.830
and you got the touch, right,

15:41.899 --> 15:43.532
when it comes to girl groups, so...

15:43.568 --> 15:47.169
Man, you still runnin'
the same old game.

15:47.194 --> 15:48.759
- What?
- You have not changed.

15:48.784 --> 15:49.830
Come on, now.

15:49.855 --> 15:51.688
All that mess you pulled with Mary.

15:51.713 --> 15:54.660
And I can't even count how many
times you screwed over Carlotta.

15:54.685 --> 15:57.178
Well, I didn't exactly have my head
screwed on straight at the time,

15:57.203 --> 15:59.810
- you know what I'm saying?
- Oh, and you do now?

15:59.835 --> 16:01.675
Okay.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.990
Look, call it, um, a
second chance or whatever.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.676
I figure if I can make it
right with Mary's girls,

16:07.701 --> 16:11.316
maybe I can redeem myself in
their eyes in some way, you know?

16:11.341 --> 16:13.341
Now, that's a tall order.

16:13.543 --> 16:16.778
'Cause you were such a dick!

16:16.803 --> 16:19.203
But, Jahil, I'll tell you what.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.958
I like those girls.

16:20.983 --> 16:23.150
So let's see what you got.

16:23.371 --> 16:25.280
Now, don't bring me no wack tracks.

16:25.305 --> 16:26.866
I don't got no time for that.

16:39.097 --> 16:40.678
A'ight, a'ight.

16:41.994 --> 16:45.092
I see somebody got their swagger back.

16:45.117 --> 16:46.514
What, you...

16:46.904 --> 16:48.701
y-you're gonna do it?

16:49.038 --> 16:51.006
I'll do it for Mary and Carlotta.

16:51.076 --> 16:52.342
I got to give you a kiss. Can I...

16:52.367 --> 16:54.881
No, you will not put
your lips on my lips.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.124
Thank you, Pumpkin.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.215
- Thank you, Pumpkin.
- Ain't nothin' changed.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.347
- You're still the same.
- Hey, you ain't gonna be disappointed.

16:59.372 --> 17:00.831
Yeah, whatever!

17:04.535 --> 17:06.041
Look, hey...

17:07.512 --> 17:09.656
Don't worry, okay?

17:10.361 --> 17:13.262
The truth will come out
and you will be exonerated.

17:13.609 --> 17:16.094
- I can feel it.
- I hope so.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.530
I'm just ready for my
life to get back to normal.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.212
That's it.

17:20.237 --> 17:22.675
I think I can help with that.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.144
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.290
You think? Or you know?

17:28.473 --> 17:29.540
Derek Jones.

17:29.565 --> 17:30.931
Yvonne Turner with Fox 6 News.

17:30.956 --> 17:32.451
I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions

17:32.476 --> 17:34.143
about the riot that happened a week ago?

17:34.170 --> 17:36.304
I threw a peaceful protest that was just

17:36.373 --> 17:38.740
co-opted by some idiots
trying to mess something up.

17:38.851 --> 17:41.178
Why don't you go find them
and ask them the questions?

17:41.327 --> 17:42.857
Get the hell out of here!

17:42.882 --> 17:45.116
Okay, Derek, just calm down, okay?

17:45.141 --> 17:47.208
Maybe Ms. Crane has
something she'd like to say.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.732
Wha...? No.

17:48.757 --> 17:50.973
Nothing about whether or not
your father, Roland Crane,

17:50.998 --> 17:52.098
plans to go after the cop

17:52.123 --> 17:54.061
that roughed you up during
a routine traffic stop?

17:54.086 --> 17:55.785
- What the hell is she talking about? Yo.
- Nothing.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.975
- What is she talking about?
- Nothing. Let's just go inside, okay?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.287
What?

18:01.273 --> 18:03.990
He's not gonna budge,
but if I get her alone...

18:08.587 --> 18:10.103
You ain't tell me that's what happened.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.829
That cop ain't had no business
putting his hands on you.

18:12.857 --> 18:15.457
Look, you need to focus
on getting cleared.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.236
Once your lawyer looks at that footage,

18:17.261 --> 18:18.556
it'll all be behind us.

18:18.581 --> 18:19.819
No, no, no, no, no.

18:19.844 --> 18:22.278
I'm sorry, baby, but we
can't just put it behind us.

18:22.358 --> 18:24.412
That's not how it
works in the real world.

18:25.833 --> 18:28.787
Just promise me you'll let this go.

18:34.218 --> 18:35.993
I can't promise you that.

18:37.499 --> 18:40.743

19:12.935 --> 19:14.890
Y'all go ahead and take a minute.

19:15.416 --> 19:16.682
Huh? What do you think?

19:16.707 --> 19:18.507
- I think you got something.
- You really do?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.265
I think you got something.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.023
- They sound hot, though.
- And you're killing it.

19:22.048 --> 19:24.055
I love it. Can we go to,
like, a four-part harmony,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.179

19:26.204 --> 19:28.615
Would you mind if I try
the vocal on the bridge?

You know that's Star's part.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.501
But...

19:33.039 --> 19:34.335
I can do it better.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.258
Man, Jahil,

19:36.283 --> 19:38.765
your girl got some big cojones.

19:40.726 --> 19:43.132

- Awesome.

19:43.157 --> 19:45.490
Let's get back to it! Whoo-whoo!

19:45.515 --> 19:47.906
So, look, your girl Eva...

19:47.931 --> 19:49.537
wants to try the bridge.

19:51.035 --> 19:52.201
That's my part.

19:52.226 --> 19:53.430
I know that,

19:53.455 --> 19:55.671
but I want to hear what she do over it.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.963
That's not a problem, is it?

19:59.163 --> 20:00.882
Nah. It's all good.

20:00.907 --> 20:02.359

The whole Spanish sauce thing?

What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna switch
the harmonies on this one part.

20:48.091 --> 20:49.993
Oh, my God. Thank you!

20:50.018 --> 20:51.799
Let me see what y'all
sound like all together.

20:51.824 --> 20:53.090
Let's take it from the top.

20:53.115 --> 20:54.380
Nice move.

20:54.685 --> 20:57.268
Just remember that I'm
in this for the long haul.

20:57.293 --> 20:59.526
Which means now that you made a move,

20:59.551 --> 21:00.862
you better watch your back.

21:02.431 --> 21:03.630
You good?

21:03.685 --> 21:06.153
She just don't know who
she messing with yet.

21:06.625 --> 21:08.534
I've been way too nice.

21:15.781 --> 21:16.888
Damn, Michelle?

21:16.913 --> 21:19.162
Do you have to have every
window open in the morning?

21:19.187 --> 21:21.765
Bitch, I gave you a
place to lay your head at.

21:21.790 --> 21:24.054
Don't come up in here with
all that negative energy.

21:24.898 --> 21:26.335
Girl, you're right. My bad.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.625
Here you go.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.718
- It's just bright.
- Mm.

21:32.078 --> 21:33.945
Cotton, you in there? Open this door.

21:34.406 --> 21:36.183
- That's your mama?
- Tell her I'm asleep.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.835
- No, no, tell her I'm not here.
- I'm not messing with her.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.429
- Cotton!
- Tell her I'm not here.

21:39.454 --> 21:40.773
I'm not talking to your crazy mom.

21:40.798 --> 21:42.210
- Cotton!
- Go get her.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.281
Get her away from my door.

21:44.710 --> 21:45.805
Go.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.132
Get out of here.

21:57.613 --> 21:59.714
You back on them drugs.

22:01.834 --> 22:04.134
All right, get your stuff. Let's go.

22:04.205 --> 22:06.873
Look, I already told
you, I'm not coming back.

22:06.898 --> 22:10.134
Stop trying to find excuses
to keep coming over here.

22:10.159 --> 22:11.569
I'm fine.

22:12.361 --> 22:15.170
You so fine now you go to work high?

22:16.780 --> 22:19.140
Who told you that? Jahil?

22:19.165 --> 22:20.186
He ain't got to tell me.

22:20.211 --> 22:22.335
I can just look at you
and see you back on it.

22:24.365 --> 22:27.418
You know the best part about
not living at your house?

22:27.557 --> 22:30.515
I ain't got to listen to
nothing you got to say.

22:35.673 --> 22:38.402
All right. Stay your simple ass here.

22:53.547 --> 22:55.341
Ms. Turner.

22:56.859 --> 22:58.279
What do you want?

22:59.188 --> 23:01.224
I got something that
could change your career.

23:02.475 --> 23:03.975
I'm listening.

23:04.085 --> 23:05.618
Officer Jay Lassiter.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.951
He's had multiple
complaints filed against him

23:07.976 --> 23:09.459
over these past three years,

23:09.484 --> 23:11.484
but he's still policing
the Atlanta streets.

23:11.509 --> 23:12.913
Wait, Lassiter... is he the one

23:12.938 --> 23:15.071
- who stopped Alexander Crane?
- Yes.

23:15.096 --> 23:16.863
And many other people, too,
but what I'm trying to say

23:16.888 --> 23:19.693
is that it's cops like him
that give others a bad name.

23:19.718 --> 23:21.811
A big profile on him would
get the people of Atlanta

23:21.836 --> 23:23.263
paying a little more attention.

23:23.686 --> 23:26.091
We can get his ass
knocked down to desk duty.

23:27.779 --> 23:29.146
All right.

23:29.598 --> 23:31.788
Thanks for the tip; we'll be in touch.

23:33.023 --> 23:35.750
But... you know if I go with this story,

23:35.775 --> 23:37.578
it-it might come back on you.

23:39.130 --> 23:40.546
Let 'em come.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.867
You know what?! I'm done, yo!

24:09.892 --> 24:11.641
This is never gonna work.

24:11.666 --> 24:12.960
Hey, Star. What are you doing? Let's go.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.039
Get back in formation.

24:14.064 --> 24:15.476
She got one more time to bump into me.

24:15.501 --> 24:16.667
She's doing it on purpose.

24:16.692 --> 24:18.312
No, I'm doing the best I can.

24:18.337 --> 24:19.867
Really? That's even worse.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.875
'Cause these moves aren't hard;
a five-year-old could do them.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.800
All right, everybody, take
a break. Just take a break.

24:23.825 --> 24:25.210
Take as long a break as you want,

24:25.235 --> 24:27.475
it's not gonna make a difference...
this bitch can't dance.

24:27.617 --> 24:30.046
I don't need a break. Let's do it again.

24:31.718 --> 24:33.281
Put the damn music on.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.808
Put the damn music on, Jahil.

24:34.833 --> 24:36.085
Oh, shut up.

24:36.406 --> 24:37.699
Okay, then, let's go.

24:51.489 --> 24:52.951
Yeah, that's it.

24:53.727 --> 24:54.943
That's it.

24:55.513 --> 24:56.755
Star.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.677
Get back into formation. Let's go.

25:07.413 --> 25:09.090
It's the other way.

25:09.150 --> 25:10.506
- Ugh!
- Bitch!

25:10.531 --> 25:11.897
You know what?!

25:11.922 --> 25:13.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:13.508 --> 25:15.018
Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

25:15.043 --> 25:16.175
Hey, that's enough! Take it easy.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.495
- Everyone just settle down.
- My God.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.229
That's it.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.549
Why are you laughing, Alex?

25:22.574 --> 25:24.807
I've never been in a fight before.

25:28.392 --> 25:30.041
Now, everybody listen up.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.284
The semifinals are tomorrow,

25:32.481 --> 25:34.495
and we're not leaving this
room till we get it right,

25:34.559 --> 25:36.713
'cause I ain't going
out that way, are you?

25:37.584 --> 25:39.510
How about you? You going out like that?

25:39.850 --> 25:41.549
We're gonna stay in here all night.

25:41.574 --> 25:42.840
We're gonna fight it out if we have to,

25:42.865 --> 25:44.268
but we're gonna get it right.

25:44.484 --> 25:45.870
Let's go.

25:46.534 --> 25:48.448
Stay in your place.

25:51.795 --> 25:54.253
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, let's do this!

25:55.434 --> 25:57.601
Everybody make some noise!

25:58.561 --> 26:02.296
All right, y'all, welcome
to Atlanta NextFest,

26:02.321 --> 26:04.048
where the best musical acts

26:04.073 --> 26:06.074
are about to perform on this stage.

26:06.099 --> 26:07.632
Come on, y'all!

26:15.606 --> 26:16.872
Where's Cotton?

26:16.941 --> 26:19.485
- My outfit just came loose.
- Oh, my God.

26:19.510 --> 26:21.677
Why are you looking at me?
What am I supposed to do?

26:21.712 --> 26:23.012
Find her.

26:23.919 --> 26:26.052
If I don't perform, you don't perform.

26:26.574 --> 26:28.050
I got to fix everything.

26:28.739 --> 26:30.886
I liked when you didn't speak English.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.488
Wow. Looks like you've been
eating a little too good

26:32.513 --> 26:33.945
- since you got here, huh?
- Come on, come on.

26:33.970 --> 26:35.518
Stop joking and just fix it.

26:35.543 --> 26:37.417
- I'm-a stay here.
- Okay.

26:37.442 --> 26:39.378
Look, man, Cotton's not answering.

26:39.426 --> 26:41.002
She's getting flakier and flakier.

26:41.027 --> 26:43.106
We're gonna have to have some
type of intervention or something.

26:43.131 --> 26:45.418
- This is crazy.
- Have you even tried to fix it?

26:45.443 --> 26:46.743
What's the matter now?

26:46.768 --> 26:48.285
My top came off.

26:49.626 --> 26:52.082
- Don't look at me.
- Then who should I be looking at?

26:52.107 --> 26:54.496
Look, we do not have time for
this. We're about to go on now.

26:54.521 --> 26:56.388
Find somebody with a needle and
thread, and I'll stitch it up.

26:56.413 --> 26:58.449
- Does anybody got a needle and thread?
- Is there a costumer in here?

26:58.474 --> 26:59.598
Anyone working got a needle and thread?

26:59.623 --> 27:01.168
You... can you bring it over here?

27:01.193 --> 27:02.481

Every little bit counts.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.711
Quick, pray Simone.

29:24.885 --> 29:26.327
Dear Lord,

29:27.002 --> 29:28.662
I know that we ain't perfect,

29:28.723 --> 29:30.150
but we try our hardest,

29:30.183 --> 29:31.971
and that should amount to something.

29:31.996 --> 29:35.119
And I know that we've done
some crazy things for music,

29:35.572 --> 29:39.330
but it's the only thing
that's brought us together.

29:40.536 --> 29:41.968
And...

29:41.993 --> 29:43.788
I know that if you could make

29:43.813 --> 29:45.779
my selfish-ass sister
and her monster ego

29:45.804 --> 29:48.269
be put on the side for our girl group,

29:48.294 --> 29:50.560

35:19.853 --> 35:22.558
Thank you. I still can't believe it.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.583

35:28.775 --> 35:30.320
Just glad you made it. We're in.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.645

35:34.462 --> 35:36.594

here. I got a surprise for you.

Okay, but I think we were
gonna celebrate, right?

35:38.376 --> 35:40.054
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll
get you back on time.

35:40.079 --> 35:41.664

- You say that every time.

35:41.689 --> 35:42.711
Are you good?

35:42.736 --> 35:44.369
Can you get a ride
home with Alex or Jahil?

35:44.527 --> 35:45.994
- Yeah, yeah.
- You sure?

35:46.019 --> 35:47.391
Yeah, I got you.

35:47.416 --> 35:48.885
All right, later.

35:48.910 --> 35:49.985

Yo, Alex?

36:02.270 --> 36:04.036
You hiring that guy,

36:04.061 --> 36:07.184
making them believe that we
needed to be a foursome...

36:07.795 --> 36:09.802
that was brilliant.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.174
All right, all right. Watch your step.

36:22.243 --> 36:23.909
- Okay.
- Watch your step.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.418
- Hunter.
- Keep your eyes closed.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.286
Keep your eyes closed. Okay,
there's a stair right here.

36:27.311 --> 36:28.802
- Okay.
- All right, watch it. Watch it.

36:28.827 --> 36:29.974
- Don't fall.
- Boy, don't kill me.

36:29.999 --> 36:31.225

- I have on heels.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.897

- All right, all right, ready?
- Okay.

36:39.193 --> 36:40.873

Baby, this place is amazing.

36:51.404 --> 36:53.037
What do you think?

36:53.442 --> 36:55.774
I think it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

36:55.843 --> 36:57.309
What is it for?

36:57.765 --> 36:59.265
I just bought it.

Really? The whole... whole place?

37:02.997 --> 37:04.606
I just...

37:04.986 --> 37:06.913
I just bought us a house.

What?

37:22.496 --> 37:24.062
What's wrong?

37:25.706 --> 37:27.119
Don't you like it?

37:29.501 --> 37:32.211
I do. I do. I love it. I just...

37:38.826 --> 37:41.003
Nobody's ever done anything
like this for me before.

37:41.028 --> 37:43.956
Nobody's even been this nice to me.

37:45.412 --> 37:47.620
I don't even know how to act.

37:52.183 --> 37:53.732
I'm sorry.

37:53.768 --> 37:55.355
Star.

37:57.038 --> 37:58.714
You deserve it.

38:30.161 --> 38:31.598
Yo, yo, Star.

38:31.623 --> 38:33.323
Star, where have you been?

38:33.755 --> 38:35.207
Jahil and Eva...

38:35.276 --> 38:37.472
they've been playing us this
whole time. You were right.

38:37.497 --> 38:38.978
What are you talking about?

38:39.046 --> 38:40.380
You know this whole foursome thing

38:40.405 --> 38:42.692
and having Eva's shady
ass added to the group?

38:42.717 --> 38:44.192
Yes, I recall.

38:44.217 --> 38:46.216
Yeah, well, it's all a lie.

38:46.348 --> 38:48.754
- I heard them bragging about it.
- Wow.

38:48.789 --> 38:49.958
I hate being right all the time.

38:49.983 --> 38:51.549
So that guy who came to rehearsal

38:51.574 --> 38:53.973
wasn't even from NextFest;
he was just bogus.

38:54.830 --> 38:57.020
This is low, even for Jahil.

38:57.286 --> 38:59.997
- I...
- Where are you going?

39:00.301 --> 39:03.536
- Yo, I'm gonna go confront their asses.
- No, you're not.

39:04.233 --> 39:06.822
We have the element of
surprise on our side.

39:06.908 --> 39:08.705
Okay, but they did
make us look like fools.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.306
I understand that.

39:10.736 --> 39:12.273
But they don't know what we know,

39:12.298 --> 39:14.040
so we're gonna take this
and use it to our advantage.

39:14.065 --> 39:15.565
And you better believe,

39:15.638 --> 39:18.728

I talked to the news reporter.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.463
You decided to make a statement now...

40:04.488 --> 40:05.838
