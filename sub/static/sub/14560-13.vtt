WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:10.111
*

00:15.049 --> 00:18.852
* Oh, help me Jesus

00:18.919 --> 00:21.355
* Come through the storm

00:21.422 --> 00:26.327
* I had to lose her

00:26.394 --> 00:29.630
* To do her harm

00:29.697 --> 00:33.267
*I heard her holler
(firecrackers popping)

00:33.334 --> 00:36.537
*I heard her moan
(excited chatter)

00:36.604 --> 00:41.875
*My lovely daughter
* My lovely daughter *

00:41.942 --> 00:45.313
*I took her home
* I took her home *

00:46.580 --> 00:50.518
* Little fish, big fish,
swimming in the water *

00:50.584 --> 00:54.588
* Come back here, man,
gimme my daughter *

00:54.655 --> 00:57.858
* Little fish, big fish,
swimming in the water *

00:57.925 --> 01:00.328
* Come back here, man,
gimme my daughter... *

01:00.394 --> 01:01.795
(speaking Mandarin)

01:01.862 --> 01:06.167
* Little fish, big fish,
swimming in the water... *

01:06.234 --> 01:07.535
(speaking Mandarin)

01:07.601 --> 01:10.438
(screaming)

01:12.873 --> 01:14.408
Alice, you've got
to get over here!

01:14.475 --> 01:15.743
This thing's going bad.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.810
I'm in trouble here.

01:16.877 --> 01:21.115
(car alarm blares,
firecrackers explode)

01:21.182 --> 01:23.384
(indistinct chatter,
car alarm blaring)

01:24.017 --> 01:25.319
License plate...

01:35.129 --> 01:36.697
Huh?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.432
Looks all right.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.234
Looks open is what it looks,
man, and I'm starving.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.969
(distant firecrackers, chatter)

01:42.035 --> 01:43.337
Year of the Ox.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.174
Chinese New Years
make ours look boring.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.911
How you doing?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.513
We're just gonna do takeout.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.115
Same menu.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.054
What do you think?

02:01.121 --> 02:04.024
It's a toss-up between

02:04.091 --> 02:05.125
the Cha Shui Bao,

02:05.193 --> 02:07.060
the Kung Pao San Yan,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.563
and Ma Poo curd with Leejee.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.999
What kind of menu is this?
I'm looking for an egg roll.

02:12.065 --> 02:12.900
Well, at least
they got pictures.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.303
That way, you can just point
at whatever you want.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.605
Yeah, flaming pig
intestines.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.407
Like I needed
a picture of that.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.575
(speaking Mandarin)

02:30.751 --> 02:31.785
(gunshots)

02:34.188 --> 02:35.856
(rapid gunfire)

02:37.124 --> 02:39.260
(glass breaking)

02:59.347 --> 03:00.814
COLBY:
So what exactly

03:00.881 --> 03:02.483
were the shooters saying?

03:02.550 --> 03:05.619
I don't really
speak much Chinese,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.155
but it seemed like
the leader guy was yelling,

03:08.222 --> 03:10.224
"Where's my girls?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.592
I want my girls back."

03:11.659 --> 03:13.394
DAVID: We got six wounded
and four dead.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.862
One of the guys
was carrying

03:14.928 --> 03:16.630
a FN P-90 machine pistol.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.666
All right, they were
ready for a massacre.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
It's funny, you know,
my dad used to take

03:20.301 --> 03:21.869
me and Charlie here
when we were kids.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.404
This place is famous.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.506
Now it's gonna be a stop on the
Death and Scandal Tour.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.074
Guys, this is Walter Yoon.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.510
It's his brother's restaurant.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.178
That's my brother...

03:31.245 --> 03:34.515
Harvey. Harvey Yoon.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.984
I'm sorry, Walter.
Can you tell me,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.052
you have any idea how
this might have happened?

03:39.119 --> 03:42.523
It's already all over Chinatown
that the Jade Boys did this.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.858
Maybe he didn't pay
his protection money.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.795
Well, he's not gonna
pay it now.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.930
Alice Chen,
Immigration Control.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.164
I've got an emergency
on my hands.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.734
I think one of my agents
was grabbed on this street.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.069
She was undercover when
she and two other women

03:56.136 --> 03:57.070
disappeared tonight.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.339
And, uh...

03:59.573 --> 04:01.975
...that's my chief suspect.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.147
It's too quiet
with my dad away.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.649
Drop a spoon or something.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.451
- So which reunion is this?
- His fiftieth.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.185
But you didn't
hear that from me.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.421
Imagine Alan
in high school.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.290
You know, hanging out
by the bike racks,

04:16.357 --> 04:17.991
snapping towels
in the shower.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.193
Thanks for the shower image.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.194
That's good.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.397
(knocking)

04:30.471 --> 04:31.972
Hello, Professor Eppes.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.241
Remember me?

04:34.308 --> 04:37.277
Yeah, I do.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.245
What do you want?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.247
I need to talk to your brother.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.248
It's professional reasons.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.150
My brother doesn't live here.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.519
I'm not going to give you
his phone number--

04:45.586 --> 04:47.988
professional reasons.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.559
When you do see him,
please tell him to call me.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.427
You bet.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.363
And, uh...

04:55.429 --> 04:57.998
Your mail.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.369
Night, now.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.406
Who was it?

05:05.473 --> 05:06.574
Simon Kraft.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.941
The police psychic guy?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.042
Wannabe psychic.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.545
What the hell is this nutcase
doing on my front porch?

05:11.612 --> 05:14.448
Maybe he's not
such a wannabe.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.384
How'd he know where you live?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.386
I don't know.
He's a former CIA spook,

05:18.452 --> 05:20.087
so maybe he got
my address

05:20.153 --> 05:21.221
from one of his
old contacts.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.690
I'm not sure.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.560
Think I should call Don,
or am I overreacting?

05:28.396 --> 05:29.830
You took too long.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.367
(phone rings)

05:34.402 --> 05:36.136
This is Eppes.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.406
Oh, hey, Charlie,
I've got to get back to you.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.640
I'm at a crime scene
at, uh...

05:39.707 --> 05:40.908
You remember that restaurant

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
that Dad used
to take us to in Chinatown?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.945
Yeah, I know.
I'll make this fast.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.281
Wait a second,
what restaurant?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.484
The Silk Dragon.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.466
CHEN: The agent we're looking
for is named Kim Hsiao.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.435
She transferred
to us from DOJ,

06:07.501 --> 06:09.102
because she's
Chinese-fluent and...

06:09.169 --> 06:10.571
because I requested her.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.839
Last night's shooters:

06:11.905 --> 06:13.741
that's Jimmy Lim on the left.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.742
He ran
the Jade Boys gang

06:14.808 --> 06:16.343
with muscle
from his cousin.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.211
Kim was working
undercover

06:18.278 --> 06:19.947
in Jimmy's sweatshop
on Bernard Street.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.815
That is, until
last night, anyway.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.717
The waiter said
that Jimmy Lim was

06:23.784 --> 06:25.819
demanding his girls
back from Harvey Yoon.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.854
You think he could've been

06:26.920 --> 06:28.055
talking about
your missing agent?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.123
Yeah, that's possible.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.925
The Department
of Transportation cameras

06:31.992 --> 06:34.361
caught Kim all the way
to Central Plaza.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.796
That's the restaurant's
location,

06:35.863 --> 06:37.297
and that's where D.O.T. stops.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.700
NIKKI: And the security cameras
should've kicked in,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.769
but on that corner
of the plaza,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.403
the cameras are
all disabled.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.705
What about backup?

06:44.772 --> 06:45.973
She didn't have any.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.142
We, uh, clocked her
off at 9:15.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.611
Next thing,
I got this call.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.480
HSIAO (on tape): Alice, you
gotta get over here.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.047
(firecrackers popping)
This thing's going bad.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.349
(firecrackers popping)

06:56.416 --> 06:57.618
(car alarm blaring)

06:57.685 --> 06:59.687
I'm in trouble here...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.955
(firecrackers
and alarm continue)

07:06.527 --> 07:08.996
(Hsiao screams, tape stops)

07:09.062 --> 07:11.198
Maybe you can do
something with it.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.666
Covert ops like this--

07:12.733 --> 07:14.902
wouldn't your agents be
wearing a beacon?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.870
Well, she had a beacon. She
didn't turn it in, so we're

07:16.937 --> 07:18.872
hopeful that she still has it.
The problem is that it only

07:18.939 --> 07:21.575
works for about
a mile or so.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.910
A mile? What kind of
beacon is that?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.945
Look, we sweatshops every day
and never had to fire a shot.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.581
Then again,
in retrospect,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.016
we should've been
more careful.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.150
We had a warning flag.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.652
What do you mean?

07:31.719 --> 07:32.786
Well, LAPD says they have

07:32.853 --> 07:34.655
five open cases
involving Chinatown women

07:34.722 --> 07:36.123
who have disappeared,

07:36.189 --> 07:37.591
and whose families
have come forward.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.793
Add to that missing illegals...
(phone vibrating)

07:39.860 --> 07:42.195
...sweatshop labor,
and it's anyone's guess

07:42.262 --> 07:43.897
how many more there've been.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.933
Our surveillance truck
says that the Jade Boys'

07:45.999 --> 07:48.101
All the guards have disappeared.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.303
DON: Why don't you grab David
and go check it out, okay?

07:50.370 --> 07:51.639
Thank you.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.642
So why'd Jimmy Lim hit
the restaurant himself?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.144
Asian gangs don't have
foot soldiers or what?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.646
Yeah, they call
them sailo.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.347
Maybe Jimmy didn't
trust his own troops.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.849
That's a good question.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.017
DON:
Oh, hey, guys. Thanks.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.653
So listen-- Simon Kraft.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.954
Oh, Charlie,
I can't deal with Simon

08:07.020 --> 08:08.388
or think about
him right now.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.757
All right, then
think about this,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.959
'cause this is what
he drew on our mail.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.962
It's amazing.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.030
You said it was right
after the shooting, right?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.732
I mean, I-I...
don't get it.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.868
CHARLIE: He's got his
background, you know?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.135
So he's probably
got a police scanner

08:22.202 --> 08:24.137
and he overheard the words
"Silk Dragon."

08:24.204 --> 08:25.939
Maybe.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.042
All right, so we're looking
for a missing ICE agent

08:29.109 --> 08:31.411
who was grabbed somewhere
near the shooting.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.080
Coincidence
or connection?

08:33.146 --> 08:33.881
We don't know.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.482
But she did try
calling in for help.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.750
Tommy, just boost
this up for me.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.086
(car alarm blares,
firecrackers popping on tape)

08:42.355 --> 08:43.857
(Hsiao screams, tape stops)

08:43.924 --> 08:46.226
She's in there somewhere.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.796
We could apply, uh,
frequency-domain processors.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.897
And Larry can help,

08:49.963 --> 08:51.965
'cause he worked with the NSA
on noise analysis.

08:52.032 --> 08:52.900
Yeah, I'll give
it a whirl.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.034
All right, great.
Have at it.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.769
Why don't you come with me?

08:57.838 --> 09:00.874
So this is the hard drive
from the restaurant.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.542
AMITA:
Multi-layer encryption.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.044
What am I looking for?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.813
I wish I could tell you,
but if you find

09:05.879 --> 09:08.048
anything interesting,
let me know, all right?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.817
All right.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.059
COLBY:
Two floors

09:19.126 --> 09:20.861
of sewing machines
and nobody's here?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.963
If this is a sweatshop,
where's all the labor?

09:40.380 --> 09:43.651
COLBY:
FN P-90 casings.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.318
Same as the restaurant.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.227
That one's Cheekay.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.863
Low-level Jade Boy.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.131
Looks like we found our
missing foot soldiers.

09:58.198 --> 10:02.202
Why would Jimmy Lim
exterminate his own men?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.203
(rumbling)

10:04.571 --> 10:07.074
(flames crackling)

10:10.678 --> 10:12.179
What? Wha...?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.048
What the hell
are trying to do, huh?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.718
Easy! Easy!

10:17.785 --> 10:20.087
I got it! I got it!

10:20.153 --> 10:21.254
(muffled voices)

10:21.321 --> 10:23.123
Colby?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.233
(speaking Mandarin)

10:33.300 --> 10:34.367
Kim?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
You see her?
No.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.871
DON:
You know anything

10:37.938 --> 10:40.207
about a girl
named Kim Hsiao?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.275
You get right to it,
Don, don't you?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.411
Why don't you have
a seat for me, please?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.545
Okay.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.847
You gave this
to my brother

10:46.914 --> 10:48.481
the night of a shooting
at a restaurant

10:48.548 --> 10:50.217
called The Silk Dragon.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.686
Okay.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.121
I can be businesslike, too.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.323
The last time I
helped the FBI,

10:56.389 --> 10:59.192
you and I scratched
each other's backs, right?

10:59.259 --> 10:59.993
So to speak.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.995
Well, I've got another itch.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.131
Let's just stick
to this, okay?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.066
Let's settle
on the terms first,

11:06.133 --> 11:06.900
all right?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.335
Here's the deal, Don.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.538
I've been pitching, uh,
an Internet reality show

11:11.604 --> 11:13.340
all about a
forensic psychic.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.045
Simon Says-- you like that?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.713
- Yeah, it's very catchy.
- I've been pitching it around,

11:19.780 --> 11:22.515
and-- knock on wood--
I got some interest.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.184
KRAFT:
So...

11:24.251 --> 11:26.119
Did you come
to see the freak show?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.221
You've all got
more patience than me.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.290
Let me tag along
for this one case,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.625
shoot some footage
for my show, and, uh...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.328
I'll help you solve your crime,
maybe even solve it for you.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.297
All right, that's it.
Forget it-- let's go.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.199
You want to think
about it, Don? Huh?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.034
No. And I'll take this,
actually.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.669
DON:
Let's go.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.471
I'm gonna want that back.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.308
It'll be waiting for you
at reception without the tape.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.280
So, Charlie has been
giving you a rough time

11:53.346 --> 11:55.015
these days, right?

11:55.082 --> 11:57.951
Science versus, uh,
the synagogue.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.419
What, are you
following me, Simon?

11:59.486 --> 12:00.653
That's not a good idea.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.222
Oh, Don, people are watching.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.591
Hey, I catch you within a block
of my family or my house,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.259
you're gonna be in for it.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.267
(sighs)

12:14.334 --> 12:15.836
I didn't know about the
restaurant shooting

12:15.903 --> 12:17.370
till I heard it on the news.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.774
KRAFT:
At first,

12:20.841 --> 12:24.177
I thought that these
were Kewpie dolls.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.180
Then, I saw

12:27.247 --> 12:30.083
that they
were little dead girls.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.751
I don't know what to tell you.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.386
I mean, it's not evidence.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.425
You've got a lot of bodies
out there, Don.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.227
And a lot more to come.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.899
(fireworks whistling,
car horns honking)

12:48.701 --> 12:50.637
(firecrackers exploding)

12:50.703 --> 12:53.406
(scream)

12:53.473 --> 12:57.177
All right, there are some
usable fragments in there.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.745
Four hours of work for that?

12:58.812 --> 13:00.080
LARRY:
Hey, it took multiple

13:00.147 --> 13:01.581
noise filters to get even that.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.617
We are stretching forensic
audiology to the limit here.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.619
Yeah, we can't use
simple notch filters

13:06.686 --> 13:07.720
because of the overlap.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.058
Now, have you ever seen
a computer graphics program?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.626
Yeah, yeah, uh, weekends I take

13:13.693 --> 13:15.762
this computer painting course,
"Click by Numbers".

13:15.829 --> 13:18.231
Yeah, right now,
I am coloring in

13:18.298 --> 13:20.267
Van Gogh's
Wheat Field with Crows.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.801
LARRY: You know,
they say the sound

13:21.869 --> 13:23.470
of the crows
caused his final madness.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.505
CHARLIE: Thank you for that,
Lawrence.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.107
Anyway, you're sitting
at your computer,

13:27.174 --> 13:28.675
and you've already
colored in the field,

13:28.741 --> 13:30.443
but now you've moved on
to painting

13:30.510 --> 13:32.012
your birds
and your clouds.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.181
What happens if you make
those birds and clouds

13:34.247 --> 13:36.383
larger and more
densely packed?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.018
Well, I can't see
my wheat field.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.252
But you know the
field's still there.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.521
It's just covered up
by a bunch of birds and clouds,

13:41.588 --> 13:44.057
so in a sense, your scene
has become visually noisy.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.192
How would you go about

13:45.258 --> 13:48.161
pushing those foreground images
into the background?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.931
I would select the crows
that were bigger,

13:50.998 --> 13:52.799
make them smaller
and blurrier,

13:52.866 --> 13:55.168
so, to the eye,
they seem farther away.

13:55.235 --> 13:59.172
Then, select the clouds
and do the same thing.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.174
The result being that you
can better see the field.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.243
So it's the same in audiology--
we just shrink the sounds

14:03.310 --> 14:05.913
we don't want to hear,
so that the sounds we do want

14:05.979 --> 14:06.980
to hear become foreground.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.248
LARRY:
We use filters

14:08.315 --> 14:09.883
to diminish or blur noise,

14:09.950 --> 14:12.019
identifying each unwanted sound

14:12.085 --> 14:13.386
by its frequency

14:13.453 --> 14:15.122
and then discriminating
against it.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.723
Yeah, so you find
the fireworks.

14:16.789 --> 14:17.891
I got car horn.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.292
What?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.194
Fireworks and car alarms--
they emit different sound waves

14:21.261 --> 14:22.629
depending on their manufacturer,

14:22.695 --> 14:24.364
so, in order to
filter them,

14:24.431 --> 14:25.865
we need their
single frequencies.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.634
I will get my coat.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.635
Right.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.942
Is that the dead restaurant
owner's computer program?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.977
I haven't gotten past
the screen saver.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.445
There's something odd here.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.479
With the screen saver?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.314
(mouse clicking)

14:41.381 --> 14:42.749
(typing)

14:42.815 --> 14:45.452
Yeah, he chose a mah-jongg
board, but it's passive.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.287
And for a game
you can't even play,

14:47.354 --> 14:49.122
it's eating up a huge amount
of memory.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.523
I can't even open it.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.426
It's like a house
without any doors or windows.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.694
How do you enter?

14:54.761 --> 14:55.963
And who's inside?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.933
DAVID: We have a missing
ICE agent

15:00.000 --> 15:02.202
who was working at
the sweatshop, Colin.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.204
What do you know
about that?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.640
Nothing, man.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.076
Nothing.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.444
What about the sailo,
the foot soldiers?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.247
Why is that you're
walking around and they're not?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.816
I didn't kill those guys.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.651
They were my friends.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.886
Jimmy did that.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.622
Why would the boss kill
his own gang, huh?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.926
He was mad because his girls
kept disappearing.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.095
CHEN:
"His" girls?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.230
Jimmy's a snake head.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.265
He smuggles the girls
from China for 30 grand,

15:32.332 --> 15:35.602
then they pay him back
at 50 cents a shirt.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.504
It's good business.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.406
DAVID:
Know something, Colin?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.242
You're the last
of the Jade Boys.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.911
Everybody else is dead.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.380
Except for you.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.951
The night Jimmy went crazy,

15:52.019 --> 15:54.887
three more girls had escaped.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.556
Jimmy said that
was the last three,

15:56.623 --> 15:57.857
and then he tortured us.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.092
Some of the gang
broke down

15:59.159 --> 16:01.461
and admitted
what they'd done.

16:01.528 --> 16:06.266
They were selling Jimmy's girls
to Harvey Yoon.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.901
What's a restaurant owner
doing buying up girls?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.471
Harvey Yoon
was selling call girls.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.573
Jimmy's girls would catch a van
at the Silk Dragon,

16:13.640 --> 16:14.741
head to Vegas, wherever.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.310
So why were you trying
to burn down the sweatshop

16:17.377 --> 16:19.579
with the girls inside?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.383
Hey, wise guy, listen--

16:23.450 --> 16:25.318
we already have you
for attempted murder

16:25.385 --> 16:26.986
and trying to torch evidence.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.821
Now, how much
you want to bet

16:28.888 --> 16:30.490
that your
gun links up

16:30.557 --> 16:32.592
with the bullets
that are in your buddies?

16:37.930 --> 16:39.266
Jimmy made me shoot the boys

16:39.332 --> 16:41.034
to prove that I wasn't
stealing his girls

16:41.101 --> 16:42.502
or working with Yoon.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.637
But you were working
with Harvey Yoon, weren't you?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.673
That's why you had
to kill the women.

16:46.739 --> 16:47.674
Because they knew it all.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.580
Double-dipping
with Harvey Yoon and Jimmy Lim.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.384
That's some dangerous
business, man.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.852
Anybody in this town
you're not working with?

16:59.919 --> 17:01.788
Just you, man.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.723
But I'm available.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.729
Black.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
Red.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.069
Black.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.537
DON:
All right, come on.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.140
What are the chances
he gets 25 wrong?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.475
Less than one in a
million, but I told you,

17:22.542 --> 17:23.843
he was reading
the reflections.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.278
He knows I was going to temple.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.346
I was in the observation room,
I heard him.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.614
Yeah, he knew you
were in there.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.481
Yeah, he guessed.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.150
He knew I was
in the room when he

17:30.217 --> 17:31.251
did this
card trick.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.452
He's a fraud,
and he sorted

17:32.519 --> 17:34.554
through our mail, man--
he could be following us.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.223
The CIA thought he
had something.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.458
And his drawings
definitely helped last time.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.760
I will not be convinced
that he wasn't complicit

17:40.827 --> 17:42.895
in every single crime
he helped solve.

17:42.962 --> 17:43.930
I don't know, man.

17:43.996 --> 17:44.964
You know, it's funny.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.399
The other day,
the rabbi was saying

17:46.466 --> 17:47.400
something interesting
about doubt.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.169
That it's part of life.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.971
You know, the darkness
is for a reason.

17:52.038 --> 17:54.274
A reason to invent
the light bulb?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.744
(phone ringing)

17:57.810 --> 17:59.279
Yeah. Eppes.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.649
Yeah, all right,
I'm sending Colby.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.220
(siren whoops)

18:11.591 --> 18:14.294
Seems like LAPD was trying
to pull him over

18:14.361 --> 18:15.328
for running a red.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.463
Turned into
a high-speed pursuit.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.631
The driver lost control
in the turn?

18:18.698 --> 18:19.932
Snapped his neck.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.801
Come see
what the dragon ate.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.873
The other two sweatshop girls.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.641
Any sign of
your agent?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.210
No Hsiao.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.314
A dragon float, two
little dead girls.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.815
It's just like Kraft's drawing.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.725
(speaking Mandarin)

18:45.792 --> 18:47.294
NIKKI: What did I miss?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.128
They didn't want to talk
until I told them that

18:49.196 --> 18:50.263
two of the women
were murdered

18:50.330 --> 18:52.399
and one was
still missing.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
(speaking Mandarin)

18:57.737 --> 18:59.306
CHEN: The night that
Kim was taken,

18:59.372 --> 19:01.474
it was Colin that brought them
Harvey's deal.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.143
She didn't go because
it was too dangerous.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.346
(speaking Mandarin)

19:09.048 --> 19:12.652
CHEN: If a woman accepted
Harvey's offer, she went

19:12.719 --> 19:14.487
to his restaurant,
got in a red van

19:14.554 --> 19:15.855
and joined the sex trade.

19:15.922 --> 19:19.492
The restaurant delivery van
is red.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.661
One night I
go for van,

19:21.728 --> 19:24.364
see my picture
on a wall.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.934
I have no family here
look for me,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.269
so who put there?

19:32.071 --> 19:34.841
DON: We start here, and we
just got to spiral out.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.143
Do you think that Kim's beacon
is still working?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.411
I hope so.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.879
Hey, I'll meet up
with you guys later.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.681
I'm gonna talk to Walter Yoon
about his brother.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.650
All right, I'll let you
know if I hear anything.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.151
Thanks.
Hey, um, Don, I, um...

19:45.218 --> 19:46.986
I want to say
that I'm sensitive

19:47.053 --> 19:47.820
to your job position,

19:47.887 --> 19:49.656
but it's my agent
who's out there missing,

19:49.722 --> 19:51.524
and I want all the help
I can get,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.893
no matter how, uh,
unorthodox.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.196
You got to be kidding.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.865
Your boss already okayed it.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.770
I call shotgun.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.177
Good guys to the rescue.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.645
Where's my camera
when I need it?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.314
Simon, look, you can't
just be chattering away

20:14.381 --> 20:15.648
the whole time, all right?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.054
Oh... hey.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.923
Uh, sorry about that.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.325
What are you guys doing?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.727
We're creating a filter
for firecrackers.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.630
Probably should have said,
"Fire in the hole," huh?

20:32.632 --> 20:34.334
CHARLIE:
We're sorry.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.902
Did you get that?

20:35.968 --> 20:36.936
Got it.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.671
(chuckling)

20:44.277 --> 20:45.945
In Chinese tradition,

20:46.012 --> 20:47.046
we burn
symbolic objects

20:47.113 --> 20:49.181
to accompany the soul
into the spirit world.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.284
They drive
in the spirit world, huh?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.488
CHEN:
This is Mr. Yoon,

20:55.555 --> 20:57.056
the spiritual
director here.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.058
My brother and I...

20:59.125 --> 20:59.892
we were not close.

20:59.959 --> 21:04.697
Hard to honor someone
so... complicated.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.765
Actually, Mr. Yoon, that's, uh,

21:05.832 --> 21:07.467
what we want
to talk to you about.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.535
Were you aware

21:08.601 --> 21:10.370
of his involvement
in criminal activities,

21:10.437 --> 21:11.504
specifically the sex trade?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.906
I certainly suspected.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.175
But good or ill,
he was my brother.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.110
Harvey...

21:18.177 --> 21:20.613
is just one face of Chinatown.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.516
Please, let me show you another.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.953
While the modern world
wages its culture wars,

21:27.019 --> 21:30.289
we elders try to pass ours
along-- what's left of it.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.994
Our cultural center
offers language class.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.629
Ah, mah-jongg.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.266
Some say the game goes all the
way back to Confucius.

21:40.333 --> 21:45.772
Tai chi-- most ancient
of disciplines.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.543
(Walter speaking Mandarin)

21:59.986 --> 22:01.621
They found her.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.022
Why don't these parents
go to the police?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.624
And be arrested?

22:04.691 --> 22:06.225
Most are undocumented.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.661
As a practical matter,
there are two million illegal

22:08.728 --> 22:10.497
Chinese immigrants living
in the state of California.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.131
It's hard to track
the missing ones

22:12.198 --> 22:14.266
when the police don't
even know they exist.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.102
WALTER: And as a moral matter,
many of these girls

22:16.168 --> 22:19.539
paid $30,000 to a smuggler
just to get here.

22:19.606 --> 22:20.807
They would rather
be chained

22:20.873 --> 22:24.377
to a pimp or a sewing machine
than be deported.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.579
My own mother was
a slave to a sweatshop.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.084
Welcome to Chinatown.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.093
KRAFT:
Outward spiral search?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.762
Why are we wasting our time?

22:42.829 --> 22:45.698
That's the standard
FBI search procedure, Simon.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.000
Uh-huh. You think a psychic
would know that.

22:48.067 --> 22:48.835
Well, I'd think the FBI

22:48.901 --> 22:51.037
would've moved on
since J. Edgar Hoover.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.539
(chuckles)

22:52.605 --> 22:54.541
All right, so, uh,

22:54.607 --> 22:56.175
I mean, if we get
within a mile, we should

22:56.242 --> 22:57.944
be getting a ping.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.513
Yeah, unless we get a ping
from our psychic first.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.748
DON:
Yeah.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.983
In fact, Simon, when do you
actually clock in?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.918
I'm in.
Like I told Chen,

23:05.985 --> 23:08.688
the first body I find
you guys is a freebie.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.823
After that, I want
a signed contract.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.525
(chuckles):
Oh, okay.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.028
HSIAO (on tape):
I'm in trouble here!

23:16.095 --> 23:19.265
Suspect is driving
a silver Toyota Sienna van.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.366
(electronic whooshing)

23:20.433 --> 23:21.868
Licen...
(whooshing)

23:21.934 --> 23:23.235
(Hsiao screams)

23:23.302 --> 23:23.936
Okay, we're getting there.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.872
What is the sound
after "license"?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.140
It's, like, two distinct sounds.
(thud)

23:28.207 --> 23:29.676
(Hsiao screams)

23:29.742 --> 23:31.844
Metallic followed by
some kind of rustling noise.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.646
Okay, metal-- you know
what it is? It's the van door.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.615
So now we know
we need another filter.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.016
Right, not to mention
the rustling noise.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.185
- Her blouse, maybe?
- Why not?

23:39.251 --> 23:40.453
You know, she was grabbed.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.854
Maybe she was trying
to hide her phone.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.356
Okay, so that's
two more filters.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.424
Okay, wait.
I help you, you help me.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.526
I discovered Harvey Yoon

23:46.593 --> 23:47.660
was passing his accounting
to somebody.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.028
CHARLIE: Some kind of an
ad-hoc network?

23:49.095 --> 23:51.230
was sending was going outever he

23:51.297 --> 23:52.632
through a ghost IP.

23:52.699 --> 23:53.733
And you can't run it down.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.134
So far it's bounced me

23:55.201 --> 23:57.036
from here to China with
stop-offs along the way.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.971
I mean, it'll take
forever to trace.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.040
It's "The Mystery of
the Secret Pen Pal."

24:04.043 --> 24:07.013
It's supposed to be the golden
days, right? High school?

24:07.079 --> 24:09.415
A cafeteria

24:09.482 --> 24:11.984
manager raped
a student worker

24:12.051 --> 24:14.286
in that building
last night, poor thing.

24:14.353 --> 24:17.189
The police know about this?

24:17.256 --> 24:19.091
I just saw it a second ago.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.762
The CIA tells me
you were discharged

24:22.829 --> 24:26.065
from the service
for sexual assault.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.467
What can I tell you, Don?
I'm a hugger.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.171
(gasping)

24:34.674 --> 24:36.275
Left turn! Now!

24:36.342 --> 24:37.844
What's that?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.345
- I said make the left!
- All right, all right.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.548
Why don't you call Chen.

24:41.614 --> 24:45.084
All right, Chen, Simon seems
to think he's onto something.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.186
- So hold on for a location.
- Right turn.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.496
Right turn again.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.206
Left turn.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.909
(beacon pings)

25:14.413 --> 25:16.215
Wait a minute--
we're in range of the beacon.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.585
(beacon pinging)

25:18.651 --> 25:20.086
All right, Chen,
we're in Monterey Park.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.221
Hill of Peace Cemetery.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.125
*

25:32.298 --> 25:35.267
(pinging)

25:41.507 --> 25:44.310
(pinging faster)

25:45.612 --> 25:46.545
Whoa.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.781
Here we go.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.116
We got to get some shovels.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.918
All right, I'll find someone
from the cemetery.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.258
Be careful,
we got something down here.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.205
She's alive.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.007
All right, let's get her
out of there.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.342
Must've caught an air pocket
or something.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.145
Nice and easy. Let's go.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.579
Let's get her
to a hospital, guys.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.914
Move!

26:21.981 --> 26:23.249
You see the way she was dressed?

26:23.315 --> 26:24.717
Like the others, right?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.919
Yeah, exactly.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.759
There's a fully intact
coffin in here; I don't know

26:32.825 --> 26:34.393
if they just laid her out
on top of it or what?

26:34.460 --> 26:36.629
What the hell's
going on around here?

26:36.696 --> 26:37.596
I don't know
how this happened.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.331
Who's grave is this?

26:39.398 --> 26:40.867
This man was buried Tuesday.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.969
We're in the Chinese
section, so obviously

26:43.035 --> 26:45.271
he's Chinese... or was.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.572
You didn't notice anything
out of the ordinary here?

26:46.639 --> 26:47.974
Somebody hanging around
or anything?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.777
Not at this grave, but, uh...
maybe the police told you.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.144
Told us what?

26:52.211 --> 26:53.880
My security guy
chased some people away

26:53.946 --> 26:55.547
from another grave
a few weeks ago.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.282
Which grave?

26:56.348 --> 26:57.917
It was dark; he couldn't
see who they were.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.693
She's been dead awhile.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.695
All dressed up,
nowhere to go.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.730
COLBY:
That's one smart psycho.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.799
Bury your victims
in a cemetery.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.577
How many women were
found like this?

27:25.644 --> 27:26.946
Four so far.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.015
What are you thinking?

27:29.081 --> 27:30.516
Those two were
injected with some form

27:30.582 --> 27:31.951
of paralyzing agent.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.820
I'm good with
poisons, but I had

27:33.886 --> 27:34.987
to send this one
out to the lab.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.189
Resembles a shellfish toxin.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.691
Death by shellfish?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.326
It's a good guess.
Look at this.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.695
Mascara was applied
thick and fast.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.963
See where some got in her eye?

27:44.030 --> 27:44.997
Normally, that would
cause tearing.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.733
There's no smudge here.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.367
CHEN:
What does that tell you?

27:48.434 --> 27:49.601
The victims were paralyzed

27:49.668 --> 27:51.037
or dead when they
were made up.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.305
That's pretty sick, doll them
all up like call girls

27:53.372 --> 27:55.674
- and dump them in graves.
- Right?

27:55.742 --> 27:57.076
Four victims.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.011
Four identical dresses...

28:00.012 --> 28:01.948
It's a weaver's label

28:02.014 --> 28:03.850
from the bottom
of a cloth bolt.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.351
Yeah, made locally.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.253
I'll check it out.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.922
You know, I think I have
a picture of my mother

28:09.989 --> 28:11.824
in a dress like this.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.692
She's no call girl.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.697
Hey.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.166
So we ran another
filter on Hsiao's tape.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.433
She said
the suspects were

28:21.500 --> 28:23.135
in a silver Toyota Sienna van.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.771
Oh, it's not like there's
a lot of those, right?

28:24.837 --> 28:26.806
One more pass, I may be able
to get a plate number, so I'm

28:26.873 --> 28:28.574
going to go record
a van door shutting.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.742
Okay, good.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.143
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.779
So we're finding more
of the double-occupancy graves.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.982
The victims are female, Asian,
all dressed up for a party.

28:36.048 --> 28:36.983
The coffins belong

28:37.049 --> 28:39.651
to Chinese males between
the ages of 14 and 78.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.820
What about Hsiao?

28:40.887 --> 28:42.989
They traced the toxin
to a type of sea snail.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.356
The syringe struck bone

28:44.423 --> 28:46.025
and broke off before all the
poison could get into her.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.659
She just might wake up.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.028
Well, that's good,
but I doubt

28:49.095 --> 28:51.297
it's going to be in time
to help us. More about the data?

28:51.363 --> 28:54.500
I mean, there's just nothing
like this in the FBI database.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.802
No similar deaths,

28:55.868 --> 28:57.069
no matching MO's,
nothing.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.338
Well, try Interpol
and the Chinese, right?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.140
Yeah, the Ministry
of Public Security.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.408
I can help out with that.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.077
KRAFT:
Hey! Finally!

29:05.144 --> 29:06.745
I got my camera back.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.848
Why so glum, Professor?

29:08.915 --> 29:10.449
The failure
of higher math

29:10.516 --> 29:11.918
to find Agent Hsiao?

29:11.984 --> 29:13.352
Did it fail?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.721
My brother filled me in
on your search pattern.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.423
Huh? How-- well, now, how...?

29:17.489 --> 29:19.158
How do you mean, Professor?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.460
Left turn, two right turns,

29:21.527 --> 29:23.295
another left?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.965
Maybe you went into the Dead
Zone for your directions.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.067
More likely followed
a classic Levy flight path.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.368
Lucky for Agent Hsiao that

29:29.435 --> 29:31.871
I thought to follow
a Levy flight path,

29:31.938 --> 29:33.272
whatever the hell that is.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.948
This is yours.
Thanks.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.449
AMITA: You're looking
at the restaurant's

29:43.515 --> 29:44.917
accounting program.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.218
You see what I see?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.187
Not being a CPA,

29:48.254 --> 29:50.122
I have to let
my eyes adjust here.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.959
Take a closer look
at the column for take-out food.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.928
All right, okay...
let's see-- 134, 440,

29:55.995 --> 29:58.764
521... Hey, wait.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.666
Each of these sets
sums to eight.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.334
And that's
too many eights

30:02.401 --> 30:04.203
for coincidence.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.805
Now take a closer look at the
column for wedding catering.

30:06.873 --> 30:10.209
All right.
1,314, 3,231, 1,800...

30:10.276 --> 30:13.379
Each set now sums to nine.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.214
Harvey Yoon,
what were you up to?

30:15.281 --> 30:17.950
You think it's
some sort of hidden

30:18.017 --> 30:19.818
accounting system
or pricing system?

30:21.420 --> 30:24.056
"The Mystery of the Motionless
Mah-Jongg Board."

30:24.123 --> 30:25.157
There is something
to this graphic,

30:25.224 --> 30:27.259
but I don't know what.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.695
Maybe a hidden pattern
in the squares?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.197
Yeah, or under the squares.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.764
You know, Harvey Yoon
had a thing

30:32.831 --> 30:33.900
for the numbers
eight and nine.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.334
Have you tried
just hitting those?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.903
Larry, I've tried every number

30:36.969 --> 30:39.138
and every combination
of number.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.373
Even control-eight?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.442
Command-eight.
Option-eight.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.844
Okay.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.416
Okay, call me low-tech,
just hit the eight

30:50.482 --> 30:52.084
eight times.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.130
Harvey Yoon's sex stable.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.864
a price list. what looks like

31:05.932 --> 31:07.266
Larry, what do you say

31:07.333 --> 31:09.201
we take a closer look
at the wedding catering?

31:09.268 --> 31:12.538
By all means. I am guessing
we enter by the nine key.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.211
Okay. Time to talk to Don.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.380
You know something?
I want to phone a friend.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.881
Who?

31:22.949 --> 31:24.516
The librarian
at the monastery.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.518
Not only is he Chinese,
he knows numbers.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.653
Better than Charlie?

31:27.719 --> 31:31.323
Oh, I don't think this
involves math, but magic.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.461
Have you seen Don?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.431
Thanks a lot.

31:39.498 --> 31:40.832
What do you got?

31:40.899 --> 31:43.169
So Nikki was right about
the tag inside the red dress.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.603
It's from a local loom,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.973
and that particular weave
has been discontinued.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.574
Now, all the remainders
were purchased

31:48.640 --> 31:50.009
by one single dress shop.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.177
Guess where
that shop was?

31:51.243 --> 31:53.212
Gotta go with Chinatown.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.982
Ministry of Public Security
sent us

31:56.048 --> 31:58.250
this output from their database.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.652
It's Chinese.
I'll let Chen know.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.421
Yeah, mug shots
in any language.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.126
I sell a lot of red dresses.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.195
Sold any to a man
like him?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.829
Yeah, I remember him.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.364
Kind of stands out.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.400
Young guy
buying 12 red dresses.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.567
All cash.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.303
Cash.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.570
Thank you.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.072
Thanks.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.978
What does he know
that we don't?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.546
And how does he know it?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.451
Ladies.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.220
What are you doing
down here, Kraft?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.223
Looking for these places

32:37.289 --> 32:40.559
that are in my sketches, huh?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.528
The Sun Yat-sen memorial--
Chinatown plaza.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.395
On every tourist map.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.832
Well, you won't find this...

32:46.898 --> 32:49.168
on any map, huh?

32:49.235 --> 32:52.504
All right, and don't try
to follow me, ladies.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.341
I'm really rather shy.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.478
Is that what you call it?

33:04.383 --> 33:06.252
LARRY: In his accounting,
Harvey Yoon kept

33:06.318 --> 33:08.620
his escort service
under "take-out."

33:08.687 --> 33:10.956
Just a little gallows humor,
I suppose.

33:11.023 --> 33:14.193
- So what are these numbers?
AMITA: Uh, prices maybe.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.627
Higher values for younger,
more attractive ones?

33:15.694 --> 33:16.528
DAVID:
Well, question.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.364
Why do the numbers
add up to eight?

33:18.430 --> 33:20.366
LARRY: This is not
about numerics.

33:20.432 --> 33:21.400
This is about
numerology.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.535
Consider when the Beijing
Olympics began.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.970
Yeah, August.

33:25.037 --> 33:28.040
More precisely,
eight seconds past 8:08

33:28.107 --> 33:30.409
on August 8, 2008.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.977
See, the Chinese
organizers wanted

33:32.044 --> 33:33.812
to bring good fortune
to their games,

33:33.879 --> 33:36.082
and eight is their luckiest,
most auspicious number.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.383
Larry discovered

33:37.449 --> 33:39.451
that Chinese couples routinely
marry on August 8.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.421
One airline paid a fortune to
get an all eight phone number.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.422
DAVID:
So Yoon wasn't just

33:43.489 --> 33:46.092
pricing his girls,
he was wishing them luck?

33:46.158 --> 33:48.227
LARRY: And he was
protecting his investment.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.096
See, by the power of the eight,

33:50.162 --> 33:51.363
he was attempting to bring

33:51.430 --> 33:53.332
good karma
to a very bad business.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.701
That's not all
the restaurant was hiding.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.570
Under the line item "wedding
expenses," we found these.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.006
LARRY: If eight is
their luckiest number,

34:01.073 --> 34:03.942
nine is their most magical.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.977
It stretches
beyond this life.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.813
It reaches up to
the very heavens.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.349
So I don't believe that
Harvey Yoon was simply

34:10.416 --> 34:12.351
renting these women out,

34:12.418 --> 34:14.153
I think they represent
final sales.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.855
And except for Hsiao,
all were homicides?

34:16.922 --> 34:18.457
They're called ghost brides.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.459
I remembered a picture
of my mother

34:20.526 --> 34:22.461
wearing a long red dress
like the victims.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.330
And when I called her,
she knew right away--

34:24.396 --> 34:25.364
it was her wedding picture.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.532
NIKKI:
We traced

34:26.598 --> 34:28.367
one victims' gowns
to a shop in Chinatown.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.968
Now, the storeowner

34:30.035 --> 34:33.672
sold 12 red dresses
just like it to Colin Pang.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.607
NIKKI:
Wedding dresses.

34:35.674 --> 34:36.442
I translated these.

34:36.508 --> 34:37.476
It's an arrest sheet.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.378
Two years ago,
in Sha'anxi Province,

34:39.445 --> 34:41.580
a gang of criminals
was arrested

34:41.647 --> 34:42.514
for killing girls

34:42.581 --> 34:45.151
and selling their corpses
to grieving parents.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.620
Parents whose sons
died bachelors.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.489
And just like here,
all the graves

34:50.556 --> 34:51.723
contain unmarried
Chinese males

34:51.790 --> 34:53.459
with unmarried Chinese females
placed next to them.

34:53.525 --> 34:57.729
So Harvey Yoon just picked up
the California franchise.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.065
Providing ghost brides
to ghost grooms.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.167
Not to mention,

35:01.233 --> 35:02.901
he was sharing his accounts
with a ghost IP.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.770
That's right--
the wedding planner may be dead

35:04.836 --> 35:06.238
but his partner's
still out there.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.239
(phone rings)

35:07.306 --> 35:08.907
All right, now,
Jimmy Lim is dead,

35:08.974 --> 35:11.810
and Colin Pang is in jail,
so who's left?

35:11.877 --> 35:13.078
It's Charlie.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.112
The tape's clean.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.283
We have our
license plate.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.656
(woman shrieking
in distance)

35:30.762 --> 35:32.431
(woman shrieking)

35:41.573 --> 35:43.675
(tires squealing,
sharp thud)

35:54.820 --> 35:56.388
HSIAO'S VOICE:
I'm in trouble here!

35:56.455 --> 35:58.857
Suspect is driving
a silver Toyota Sienna van.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.459
(muffled traffic noise on tape)

36:00.526 --> 36:03.128
License plate, B-A-8...

36:03.195 --> 36:04.463
- You got it?
- Getting it.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.432
B-A, somebody's
initials.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.999
Ba is the Chinese word
for number eight.

36:08.066 --> 36:10.035
- Lucky eight.
DAVID: It's a company car.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.170
Five Emperors Cultural Center.
Bernard Street.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.339
That's Walter Yoon.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.541
Good. Why don't you guys
get over there.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.352
We'll check the back.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.225
Hey, where's
Walter Yoon?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.338
All right.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.540
Call it in.

36:50.942 --> 36:55.146
Looks like Walter's been fishing
where there ain't no fish.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.748
Yeah, but a whole lot
of sea snails.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.117
What you want to bet
that's our toxin?

36:59.184 --> 37:03.455
Yeah, now where
the hell is he?

37:03.522 --> 37:05.457
I'll get a warrant
for this computer.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.293
Any sign of Walter?

37:07.359 --> 37:09.661
Simon Kraft is dead
in the alleyway.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.263
What?!

37:11.330 --> 37:12.298
How?

37:12.364 --> 37:13.432
I think he was run over.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.434
Take a look at this.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.636
DAVID:
That's the silver van.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.508
Wait a second--
I know her.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.947
An older couple took
her picture down

37:29.014 --> 37:32.083
off the Missing Persons board
and handed it to Walter.

37:32.150 --> 37:36.054
What if they were shopping
for a daughter-in-law?

37:36.121 --> 37:38.657
You know, like at the restaurant
with the pictures.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.826
You just point
at the one you want.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.562
It's a menu.

37:43.629 --> 37:44.830
They're gonna bury
this girl.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.798
NIKKI: We've got
exigent circumstances--

37:46.865 --> 37:49.501
I think we can search this
computer without a warrant.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.872
Try hitting the nine key
nine times in a row.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.977
NIKKI:
There she is.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.996
(speaking Mandarin)

38:23.635 --> 38:24.570
DON:
FBI! FBI! Freeze!

38:24.636 --> 38:26.037
NIKKI: Put your hands
behind your back.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.072
No! Stay away from here!

38:27.138 --> 38:28.374
Stay away!

38:28.440 --> 38:29.475
- Let's go!
WALTER: You stay away!

38:29.541 --> 38:31.276
- You stay away from here!
- Take it easy.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.744
Just take it easy,
it's over.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.613
No, this is a
question of honor!

38:34.680 --> 38:36.482
Whose honor?
Tell me.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.817
This couple lost
their only son.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.586
Give them
the comfort of knowing

38:40.652 --> 38:42.788
he will not
spend eternity alone.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.089
I can't take the shot as long
as that needle's on her neck.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.156
DON:
What about her?

38:45.223 --> 38:46.291
What about her family?
They don't matter?

38:46.358 --> 38:48.226
WALTER: Ghost brides are a
tradition as old as China,

38:48.293 --> 38:50.095
as old as time itself.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.997
We all have our place
in this tradition.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.365
This is hers.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.332
Here with him.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.267
We got a tradition, too,
and it's saving lives, okay?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.302
I'm going to let you hurt her.

38:57.369 --> 38:58.336
You misunderstand--

38:58.404 --> 39:01.907
this is not a funeral,
it is a wedding.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.875
(speaking Mandarin)

39:05.477 --> 39:08.013
Come on, come on.
I got ya, I got ya...

39:09.381 --> 39:11.182
You all right, Colb?

39:11.249 --> 39:12.384
Yeah.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.820
What'd you say to him?

39:14.886 --> 39:16.121
Shame on you.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.224
I wonder how many other women
the Yoon brothers have buried.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.594
Never found or even missed.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.132
This is for them.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.662
"Lead with your brain,
but follow your heart."

39:56.728 --> 39:58.664
It's fitting.

39:58.730 --> 40:02.333
"Your dreams can't come true
unless you wake up."

40:02.400 --> 40:04.169
That's rather
profound.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.037
An amazing creation,
the fortune cookie.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.372
It says in my book,

40:07.439 --> 40:09.340
it predates
the Han dynasty.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.442
Fortune cookies?

40:10.509 --> 40:11.777
No, minghun,
the marriage of the dead.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.145
Well, the Yoons perverted
the custom,

40:14.212 --> 40:17.382
where the bride and groom
are naturally deceased.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.350
Astrologically
suitable corpses

40:19.417 --> 40:21.753
keep each other company
through eternity.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.490
There's a certain poetry
in that.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.191
Sounds a little macabre.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.660
No, I see what he means,
in an Eastern sort of way.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.463
Two total strangers locked
in eternal embrace,

40:31.530 --> 40:33.765
joined only by their
connection to the stars.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.934
That's it, like my department
at CalSci.

40:36.001 --> 40:40.739
All right, so, how do we all
ultimately come down on Kraft?

40:40.806 --> 40:43.108
That's a life that ends
in a question mark.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.175
Yeah, the question being:

40:44.242 --> 40:45.944
Why does the world
require a Simon Kraft?

40:46.011 --> 40:47.579
You know, you look
at the news--

40:47.646 --> 40:49.147
you've got Bigfoot
or the Loch Ness monster.

40:49.214 --> 40:52.317
Nothing on the great apes
or the blue whales,

40:52.383 --> 40:53.485
which are real marvels.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.386
Now, remote viewing,
psychic warfare--

40:55.453 --> 40:57.489
these weren't
some tabloid invention,

40:57.556 --> 40:59.324
but the brainchildren

40:59.390 --> 41:01.527
of respected physicists
at Stanford.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.361
CHARLIE: I will fall
on my slide rule

41:03.428 --> 41:04.796
if anyone can prove to me

41:04.863 --> 41:07.633
that Simon Kraft had
extrasensory abilities.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.435
All right:
What inner power led Simon

41:10.502 --> 41:14.706
to the killer's van precisely
at the moment of kidnap?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.642
Oh, you mean the same power
that failed to warn him

41:16.708 --> 41:18.209
that he was going to be run over

41:18.276 --> 41:19.978
by that van?

41:20.045 --> 41:21.246
Help me out here.

41:21.312 --> 41:25.684
You know, I have to say
I'm in the undecided column.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.153
I am going
to read my book in peace.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.621
And I to my bed.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.823
But I will leave you with this.

41:31.890 --> 41:35.694
When Magellan landed
on Tierra del Fuego,

41:35.761 --> 41:37.763
this remote island at
the bottom of the world,

41:37.829 --> 41:39.264
the villagers all
gathered to greet him,

41:39.330 --> 41:42.300
but mostly they kept staring
at the horizon behind him.

41:42.367 --> 41:46.004
Having no concept
of a boat larger than a canoe,

41:46.071 --> 41:49.708
they somehow didn't even see
these five galleons

41:49.775 --> 41:51.743
anchored in plain sight.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.012
A flotilla
of ships was

41:54.079 --> 41:57.082
invisible to their
disbelieving eyes.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.984
Yeah, well,
you're illustrating my point.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.319
That the ignorant can't
see the plain truth

42:01.386 --> 42:03.121
right in front of them.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.390
Or maybe an ocean fog
concealed those ships.

42:05.456 --> 42:08.259
Yeah, well, I can see the fog
has rolled in all right.

42:08.326 --> 42:09.828
Good night, Charles.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.997
- Don.
- Good night, Lawrence.

42:12.063 --> 42:15.366
I gotta go pick up dad at the
airport-- you want to come?

42:15.433 --> 42:16.301
Yeah, sure.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.070
You know, Larry looks up
at the stars and asks why.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.639
You've been going
to temple...

42:20.706 --> 42:22.107
I don't know.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.110
Maybe it's okay living
without all the answers.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.312
If I ever get any,
I'll let you know.
