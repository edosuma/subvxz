00:11.734 --> 00:13.167
Are you mad at me?

00:16.534 --> 00:18.434
You're mad at me.

00:18.434 --> 00:21.734
I'm a detective. I can tell.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.167
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:26.167 --> 00:27.567
You didn't do anything.

00:27.567 --> 00:28.801
That's the problem.

00:28.801 --> 00:31.734
You didn't say a single word all night.

00:31.734 --> 00:33.300
I don't understand. Why
did you want to come?

00:33.300 --> 00:35.033
You begged me to invite you.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.634
I didn't want to be alone.

00:36.634 --> 00:38.501
You were gonna be gone all weekend.

00:38.501 --> 00:39.767
It's embarrassing.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.767
Those people are my oldest friends.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.267
Everybody thought you
were sick or something.

00:43.267 --> 00:46.601
You just walked around
rearranging spoons

00:46.601 --> 00:49.300
And plates and sweeping up crumbs.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.534
Couldn't you have at least tried?

00:51.534 --> 00:53.567
I tried. I smiled.

00:53.567 --> 00:54.667
I smiled a lot.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.267
You were wincing!

00:56.267 --> 00:58.267
That's my smile. That's how i smile.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.434
I'm just not a people person.

01:01.434 --> 01:02.801
But what does that mean?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.733
What does that mean? You're not human?

01:04.733 --> 01:05.934
Actually, you know what?

01:05.934 --> 01:06.934
That would explain a lot.

01:06.934 --> 01:07.934
It wouldn't explain everything,

01:07.934 --> 01:09.434
But it would explain a lot.

01:10.467 --> 01:11.501
Uh... did you hear that?

01:11.501 --> 01:13.234
That can't be good.

01:13.234 --> 01:15.200
Why are we in this car?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.767
I told you julie borrowed my car.

01:16.767 --> 01:17.968
She's moving some furniture.

01:17.968 --> 01:19.834
We are in the wrong car.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.033
This is the wrong car!

01:22.033 --> 01:23.467
Well, it's too late now!

01:30.100 --> 01:32.367
It's not the radiator hose.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.000
What about that?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.701
That's the radiator hose. It's not that.

01:35.701 --> 01:37.701
It's not the battery.

01:37.701 --> 01:39.033
It's not the alternator.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.634
What about that?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.367
That's the radiator hose, mr. Monk.

01:42.367 --> 01:43.667
You keep pointing to the same thing.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.000
Here. Call for help.

01:47.467 --> 01:48.968
It says "no signal."

01:48.968 --> 01:50.100
Well, then go try over there.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.967 --> 03:20.401
Well, for starters, you
got a blown solenoid.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.733
That's just for starters.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.900
Monk, everybody needs
their eyes checked.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.000
Stop saying that. I don't need glasses.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.834
I definitely saw something.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.767
It was some kind of aircraft.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.167
I'm sure you did, mr. Monk.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.900
At least you think you did.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.000
It knocked out one, two,
three routing switches.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.600
Fried some wiring.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.334
It's gonna run you 300, parts and labor.

03:39.334 --> 03:40.967
Ugh. Well, when will it be ready?

03:40.967 --> 03:42.667
Tomorrow if you're lucky.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.000
Excuse me.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.934
Is there an air force base around here?

03:44.934 --> 03:46.434
An air force base?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.167
Can't say there is, because there ain't.

03:48.167 --> 03:50.167
Oh. Weather station?

03:50.167 --> 03:51.534
No.

03:51.534 --> 03:53.334
We got a new putt-Putt
course out on highway nine.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.034
You're probably
wondering why i'm asking.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.834
Not particularly.

03:56.834 --> 04:00.234
I, uh, i saw something
in the sky last night.

04:00.234 --> 04:02.367
Some kind of hovering thing.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.167
A hovering thing? Like a flying saucer?

04:04.167 --> 04:06.401
Not a saucer, no.

04:06.401 --> 04:07.600
Okay, yes.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.401
Yes, it was sort of... saucer-Shaped.

04:10.401 --> 04:11.600
I know that sounds crazy

04:11.600 --> 04:13.367
Not to me. I saw a ghost once.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.633
Okay.

04:15.633 --> 04:18.468
What?

04:18.468 --> 04:19.899
Not the same thing.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.233
I saw a ghost.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.534
It was in my stepfather's barn.

04:22.534 --> 04:24.800
Right. Right, right.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.234
What you saw was real
but i didn't see a ghost?

04:28.234 --> 04:29.967
There's a difference.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.067
I'm not you.

04:32.067 --> 04:36.733
I, uh, i make my living
up here...with my head.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.167
You're calling me stupid.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.667
No.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.067
No, that's not what he meant.

04:42.067 --> 04:45.934
Well, maybe i'm not smart
enough to fix your car.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.800
Huh?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.000
No. No, no, no, no.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.067
Sir, sir, sir. Mister, um, mister...

04:51.067 --> 04:52.267
Boom.

04:52.267 --> 04:54.700
What my friend meant to say...

04:54.700 --> 04:57.201
No, no, no, no. You can fix the car.

04:57.201 --> 04:58.234
You're car smart.

04:58.234 --> 05:00.234
I'm car smart?

05:00.234 --> 05:02.568
Is that what you just said?

05:02.568 --> 05:04.334
I don't remember.

05:04.334 --> 05:05.568
Okay, you know what?

05:05.568 --> 05:08.134
Here's my new estimate. $800.

05:08.134 --> 05:09.501
You just said 300!

05:09.501 --> 05:10.900
Well, i must've added the numbers wrong.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.267
I was confused.

05:12.267 --> 05:15.600
You see, i'm not really smart up here.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.301
I'll go write it up.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.600
Apologize. Okay, i'm sorry.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.101
Not to me. To the guy.

05:24.101 --> 05:26.667
What for? You called him stupid!

05:26.667 --> 05:27.934
Well...

05:27.934 --> 05:29.534
You can't say things
like that, mr. Monk.

05:29.534 --> 05:31.501
He's a human being. He has feelings.

05:31.501 --> 05:34.134
Do you have no empathy
at all for other people?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.568
Put yourself in his place.

05:36.568 --> 05:40.000
You know, imagine being him.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.468
Okay, i'm him.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.700
Oh, god, i got to go take a shower

05:44.700 --> 05:46.534
And finish high school.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.267
Sorry.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.067
Yeah.

05:53.067 --> 05:54.201
Yeah, me too.

05:54.201 --> 05:57.568
We don't accept checks.

06:04.067 --> 06:05.834
Stottlemeyer.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.034
Captain. Hey, it's natalie.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.301
Hey. Uh, i don't think we're gonna

06:08.301 --> 06:09.867
Be making that training seminar today.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.034
Oh, that's all right.
We can reschedule it.

06:12.034 --> 06:13.301
What's going on? You okay?

06:13.301 --> 06:14.900
Yeah, i think so. You think so?

06:14.900 --> 06:17.201
Well, i'm in nevada with mr. Monk.

06:17.201 --> 06:18.434
My car broke down.

06:18.434 --> 06:20.301
We're in some town called vintonville.

06:20.301 --> 06:22.334
I've never heard of it.

06:22.334 --> 06:23.967
Yeah, i don't think it's
actually on any maps.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.667
What's wrong with the car? I don't know.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.101
There's only one mechanic in town.

06:27.101 --> 06:29.867
His name is boom boom
and he already hates us.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.867
How's monk holding up?

06:31.867 --> 06:34.767
Not so good. He thinks he saw a ufo.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.401
Really?

06:37.401 --> 06:39.201
Well, maybe they're
there to take him home.

06:39.201 --> 06:40.367
Maybe that's his ride.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.501
That's what i said!

06:46.534 --> 06:48.334
That would explain a lot, wouldn't it?

07:00.367 --> 07:02.067
I'm really worried, sheriff.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.201
I can see that, dolly.

07:04.201 --> 07:05.468
It's not like her.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.034
All her lights have
been out for four days.

07:07.034 --> 07:08.167
How do you explain that?

07:08.167 --> 07:10.301
We both know what margie's like.

07:10.301 --> 07:11.934
Remember three years ago?

07:11.934 --> 07:13.234
She ran off to reno with
the accordion player.

07:13.234 --> 07:14.234
Excuse me.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.334
Yeah, i'll be right with you.

07:16.334 --> 07:17.468
Unless it's an emergency. No.

07:17.468 --> 07:18.900
Good, good.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.667
Because frankly i wouldn't
know what to do if it was.

07:21.667 --> 07:22.900
Well, why didn't she ask
me to bring in her mail?

07:22.900 --> 07:24.568
She always asks me to bring in her mail.

07:24.568 --> 07:26.334
Because maybe she left in a hurry.

07:26.334 --> 07:27.967
Maybe she got swept off her feet.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.301
This is marge we're talking about.

07:29.301 --> 07:30.667
Can't you go in and look around.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.733
I don't have any cause, dolly.

07:32.733 --> 07:34.000
It's only been four days.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.267
Come on, i will bet you a slice

07:36.267 --> 07:38.067
Of your award-Winning pecan pie

07:38.067 --> 07:40.900
That next week she shows
up with a new boyfriend

07:40.900 --> 07:42.967
Or a new tattoo or both.

07:42.967 --> 07:45.201
It is gonna work itself out, i promise.

07:45.201 --> 07:46.434
It always does.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.501
Everybody's business is
everybody else's business.

07:51.501 --> 07:53.700
That's why we live here, i guess.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.201
So, how can i help you, mister, um...

07:56.201 --> 07:58.067
Monk. Adrian monk.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.700
Mr. Monk.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.867
I was at a wedding
last night in montville

08:02.867 --> 08:05.600
With my assistant.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.834
And we were driving home
and the car broke down.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.834
It was about a mile north of here.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.434
There was a bridge.
Yeah, west creek bridge.

08:11.434 --> 08:15.067
Well, i saw something.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.367
Okay.

08:16.367 --> 08:20.267
In...in the sky.

08:23.568 --> 08:26.867
Yeah, it... it was about 10:30 p.M.

08:26.867 --> 08:28.934
And it was all lit up.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.667
It was hovering there.

08:30.667 --> 08:35.034
And, uh, and it went zipping around.

08:35.034 --> 08:37.799
You saw a ufo?

08:37.799 --> 08:39.267
No. No, i didn't say that.

08:43.267 --> 08:46.434
So, uh, was it an object?

08:46.434 --> 08:47.834
Yes.

08:47.834 --> 08:50.468
Uh, could you identify it?

08:50.468 --> 08:51.867
No, no. No.

08:51.867 --> 08:54.534
And it was flying.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.834
Yes.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.067
You add that all up, mr. Monk,

08:57.067 --> 08:58.934
You've got yourself a ufo.

08:58.934 --> 09:00.000
Okay, look.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.201
All i'm asking is this:

09:01.201 --> 09:03.067
Did anyone else see anything last night?

09:03.067 --> 09:08.568
No, sir. Nothing was reported.

09:08.568 --> 09:11.301
You know, the weather out here
can be a little bit tricky.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.167
Occasionally we get something
called dry lightening.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.633
No, this wasn't lightening.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.267
It was a vehicle.

09:17.267 --> 09:21.134
It was a flying...thing.

09:21.134 --> 09:23.401
Okay.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.167
Where... where are you staying?

09:25.167 --> 09:27.301
We're at the sleep
inn out on route four.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.167
Okay, well, i will call
you if i hear anything.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.134
Thank you so much for stopping by.

09:32.134 --> 09:34.267
Okay, can i just say one thing here?

09:34.267 --> 09:38.301
Okay, i am not one of
those, you know, nuts.

09:38.301 --> 09:40.867
I'm a former detective.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.334
I work for the san
francisco police quite a bit.

09:43.334 --> 09:44.501
In fact, you can call them.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.967
That won't be necessary.

09:45.967 --> 09:48.468
I believe you saw what you saw.

09:48.468 --> 09:50.301
Let me show you something, mr. Monk.

09:50.301 --> 09:53.000
These are the cases that i have pending.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.401
I've got a rabid raccoon on the loose.

09:55.401 --> 09:58.134
And i've got teenagers
knocking over some mailboxes.

09:58.134 --> 09:59.468
And now i've got dolly

09:59.468 --> 10:00.568
Who thinks that her
neighbor's gone missing.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.267
And this is a busy week for me.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.367
To tell you the truth,

10:03.367 --> 10:05.334
I kind of hope you're right.

10:05.334 --> 10:06.967
I mean, a martian invasion

10:06.967 --> 10:09.201
Would be quite a nice
change of pace around here.

10:13.501 --> 10:14.568
Look there! What's that?

10:14.568 --> 10:15.600
What's that over there?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.201
Mr. Monk, it's a firefly.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.501
Oh, yeah.

10:18.501 --> 10:20.267
While i was at the library,

10:20.267 --> 10:22.767
I did some research on u... you know.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.000
Ufos. Right.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.067
And they said it's usually swamp gas.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.534
Yeah, you could be right.

10:28.534 --> 10:30.967
Except we're 3,000 miles
from the nearest swamp.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.867
I think i was just
tired and seeing things.

10:33.867 --> 10:34.934
Yeah, that's what i think.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.468
Mr. Monk, ms. Teeger,

10:36.468 --> 10:38.234
I got your message about
your staying another night.

10:38.234 --> 10:40.234
Yeah, is that okay? Sure, no problem.

10:40.234 --> 10:41.900
Stay as long as you want.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.234
It's nice to have the company

10:43.234 --> 10:45.501
And the truth is it's been pretty quiet.

10:45.501 --> 10:47.167
Is there a problem with your room?

10:47.167 --> 10:49.867
I couldn't help noticing
all your cleaning supplies.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.867
Oh, no, no. It's fine.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.201
The hotel's great.

10:53.201 --> 10:55.334
This is just a hobby.

10:55.334 --> 10:56.600
He only bought one bag.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.633
That's like giving you a gold star.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.501
Really?

11:02.501 --> 11:05.733
Natalie, natalie, natalie. What?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.434
Cheese and crackers.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.201
You see that?

11:09.201 --> 11:11.633
- Are you nodding?
- Yeah, i am.

12:41.767 --> 12:44.801
I bet they came from andromeda

12:44.801 --> 12:46.433
From the first or second nebulae,

12:46.433 --> 12:50.433
Which means they've been
traveling for 5,217 years.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.001
There are no inhabitable planets

12:52.001 --> 12:53.600
In the andromeda galaxy, nimrod.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.734
Don't call him nimrod.

12:54.734 --> 12:55.767
It's okay. It's my name.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.268
Hey! Guys!

12:58.268 --> 13:00.467
Guys, you know there was a
sighting here 65 years ago.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.767
Government said that it
was a weather balloon.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.534
A weather balloon?

13:04.534 --> 13:05.901
Excuse me.

13:05.901 --> 13:07.101
Did you make the video,
the one on the internet?

13:07.101 --> 13:08.201
That was me.

13:08.201 --> 13:09.300
Where'd you see it?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.967
Over there, right above that tree.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.067
Who are they?

13:24.067 --> 13:25.534
Oh, it's the internet, mr. Monk.

13:25.534 --> 13:26.934
News like this travels fast.

13:26.934 --> 13:29.467
Ah, the internet people.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.234
Hi. Is this the lobby?

13:31.234 --> 13:32.600
It's right over there.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.034
What's going on here?

13:34.034 --> 13:35.834
Is there a loser convention in town?

13:35.834 --> 13:38.001
Somebody saw a flying saucer.

13:38.001 --> 13:39.734
A flying saucer?

13:39.734 --> 13:41.201
I know.

13:41.201 --> 13:42.834
The image i saw was clearly a class four

13:42.834 --> 13:45.101
Intergalactic doom freighter.

13:45.101 --> 13:48.600
Flying saucer?

13:48.600 --> 13:51.333
They're coming for the oxygen.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.867
Have the negotiations started yet?

13:54.867 --> 13:57.400
Uh, we haven't heard.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.901
I'm gonna call the garage,
see if the car's ready.

13:58.901 --> 13:59.934
Yeah, dial fast.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.367
Dial like the wind.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.667
Excuse me.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.700
The hotel clerk said that
you were the alpha contact.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.867
The alpha contact?

14:06.867 --> 14:09.367
<i>The first to see them.</i>

14:09.367 --> 14:10.967
Did the saucer make any noise?

14:10.967 --> 14:12.168
Were the lights blinking?

14:12.168 --> 14:13.333
And was it like a random blinking

14:13.333 --> 14:14.634
Or was it more rhythmic?

14:14.634 --> 14:16.034
Were you probed?

14:16.034 --> 14:18.467
Uh, nah... nah... no.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.067
Are you sure?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.433
Sometimes they probe you
and give you an amnesia pill.

14:21.433 --> 14:22.901
Yeah, i'd remember.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.834
Sometimes they give
you a frontal lobotomy.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.634
I'd still remember. Natalie!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.634
Um, pardon me. Pardon me.

14:29.634 --> 14:31.967
The part's not in yet.

14:31.967 --> 14:33.300
I think he's still mad at you.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.367
Call him again. Call him back!

14:34.367 --> 14:35.534
It was just two minutes ago.

14:35.534 --> 14:37.333
Well, offer him more money.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.867
Offer to marry him!

14:39.867 --> 14:41.467
They found the landing site!

15:01.400 --> 15:04.333
Excuse me. Don't touch that.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.801
That could be evidence.

15:05.801 --> 15:09.567
One, two, three, four depressions.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.333
Maybe it's from the landing gear.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.067
Holy moly!

15:13.067 --> 15:14.767
This one actually might be real!

15:14.767 --> 15:16.333
A real one finally.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.201
Can't wait to tell my stepdad.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.001
He's been laughing at me for 20 years.

15:20.001 --> 15:21.500
Look at these burn marks.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.867
They must be from the... from the...

15:22.867 --> 15:24.801
From the... what do you
call it? The thrusters.

15:24.801 --> 15:26.101
Somebody should get a picture of this.

15:26.101 --> 15:28.268
So, what do you think?

15:28.268 --> 15:30.201
I can't think.

15:30.201 --> 15:31.467
All these internet people.

15:31.467 --> 15:32.801
We're going to fan out

15:32.801 --> 15:33.967
And look for the rest of the fleet.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.333
Great idea. Fan out.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.400
Fan way out.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.101
Way, way, way, way out.

15:40.101 --> 15:42.134
Well, there was something here.

15:42.134 --> 15:46.801
I mean, something
made these impressions.

15:46.801 --> 15:49.767
It had to be last night
because it rained yesterday.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.467
Mr. Monk, isn't it possible?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.067
We both saw what we saw.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.134
No!

15:54.134 --> 15:55.967
No, it is not possible.

15:55.967 --> 15:57.700
Of course it's possible.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.300
As carl sagan said,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.600
"It's pure hubris to
assume our tiny blue marble

16:02.600 --> 16:05.367
Could contain the only
intelligent life in the galaxy."

16:05.367 --> 16:08.767
The aliens have arrived.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.934
Or. Or what?

16:10.934 --> 16:13.134
Or anything.

16:13.134 --> 16:14.367
Any other explanation.

16:14.367 --> 16:16.700
It... it might have been
some kind of a prank.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.834
Maybe some college kids.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.034
Why would they bother?

16:19.034 --> 16:20.767
I don't know.

16:20.767 --> 16:25.367
All i know is it wasn't
from...outer space.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.300
All right?

16:27.300 --> 16:28.834
Let's agree to disagree, hmm?

16:28.834 --> 16:33.467
Let's agree to not even do that.

16:33.467 --> 16:36.400
Wipe.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.634
What is he doing?

16:37.634 --> 16:39.201
He has a little germ thing.

16:39.201 --> 16:42.034
You afraid of our germs?

16:42.034 --> 16:44.333
Not yours in particular. Anybody's.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.867
He's not sweating.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.300
Yeah, i noticed that too.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.067
How come you're not sweating?

16:50.067 --> 16:52.400
I don't sweat.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.867
I... it's a glandular thing.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.534
He was the alpha contact.

16:55.534 --> 16:57.734
He was going like this.
What do you think it means?

16:57.734 --> 16:58.901
It's some kind of signal.

16:58.901 --> 17:01.101
No, it's not a signal.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.834
It... it just helps me concentrate.

17:02.834 --> 17:06.134
Can we see your belly button?

17:06.134 --> 17:07.666
No, you may not.

17:12.433 --> 17:14.268
What are you doing?

17:14.268 --> 17:16.534
We're showing you ours.

17:16.534 --> 17:17.767
Now you show us yours.

17:17.767 --> 17:21.567
He has a belly button, okay?

17:21.567 --> 17:23.433
Pretty sure.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.001
You're pretty sure? But
you've never seen it.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.300
He's not an alien.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.567
Are you sure about that?

17:27.567 --> 17:30.534
100%? What do you want from us?

17:30.534 --> 17:32.700
How often do you excrete?

17:34.134 --> 17:35.300
See, our car's in the shop. Yeah.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.700
So, and we think it's ready.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.901
And i think they're calling, actually.

17:37.901 --> 17:39.234
They're ready. They just called me.

17:39.234 --> 17:40.634
Another day?

17:40.634 --> 17:41.834
It's my distributor.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.201
He sent me the wrong part.

17:43.201 --> 17:44.867
I guess he's even more stupid than i am.

17:44.867 --> 17:48.534
Here's the thing, bobo. It's boom boom.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.034
Boom boom. Sorry.

17:50.034 --> 17:52.467
We really have to get back
home, so we could pay extra

17:52.467 --> 17:54.734
If there's any way we
could expedite things.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.967
Well, let's see.

17:56.967 --> 18:01.067
We'll give him a call.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.901
It's ringing.

18:02.901 --> 18:04.034
Charlie!

18:04.034 --> 18:05.901
It's your old pal, boom boom.

18:05.901 --> 18:06.967
Okay, listen, boom boom.

18:06.967 --> 18:09.400
About yesterday,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.367
I'm sorry i said you
were stupid out loud.

18:11.367 --> 18:13.001
You're not sorry you thought it,

18:13.001 --> 18:14.467
You're just sorry you said it?

18:14.467 --> 18:16.801
Yeah, i'm not gonna
apologize for thinking...

18:16.801 --> 18:18.400
Just don't say anything else!

18:18.400 --> 18:19.967
I'm not...

18:21.734 --> 18:23.801
We're gonna check back in
with you later, boom boom.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.067
Thank you.

18:34.801 --> 18:35.934
Over here!

18:35.934 --> 18:37.967
Not so loud. You'll scare them away.

18:37.967 --> 18:38.967
I don't think so.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.867
Saw a movie once about
an extra terrestrial

18:57.867 --> 19:00.400
Who didn't know he was
an extra terrestrial.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.268
They rewired his brain or something.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.201
I don't watch movies.
Give me bad dreams.

19:06.201 --> 19:08.067
That's funny.

19:08.067 --> 19:09.234
In the movie,

19:09.234 --> 19:10.500
The extra terrestrial had bad dreams.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.367
What are you talking about?

19:12.367 --> 19:14.700
Nothing.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.600
Mr. Monk, you mentioned
you were a detective.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
I took the liberty of
calling san francisco.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.234
Spoke to leland stottlemeyer.

19:22.234 --> 19:24.168
He spoke very highly of you.

19:24.168 --> 19:26.700
I wonder if you could help us out.

19:29.234 --> 19:33.234
Edward garcia, adrian
monk, natalie teeger.

19:33.234 --> 19:36.567
Dr. Garcia and i don't
get many cases like this,

19:36.567 --> 19:40.333
So we want to be sure that wt it right.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.634
Oh, god. Oh, no!

19:41.634 --> 19:43.667
Oh, the poor thing.

19:43.667 --> 19:46.300
The missing woman?

19:46.300 --> 19:49.867
I owe dolly a big apology.

19:49.867 --> 19:52.234
This is, or was marge larkin.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.634
Where's her face?

19:53.634 --> 19:56.067
Coyotes, probably.

19:56.067 --> 19:58.767
She's been five days,
maybe six in the sun.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.600
She was a hiker?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.400
Marge was a lot of things.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.801
She, uh, she came into
a little bit of money

20:03.801 --> 20:05.367
A few years ago when her parents died,

20:05.367 --> 20:07.268
And so she just dabbled

20:07.268 --> 20:09.101
In all kinds of things.

20:09.101 --> 20:12.767
Yoga, spelunking, trout farming.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.734
And apparently hiking.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.801
Where's her face?

20:16.801 --> 20:18.400
We already talked about the face, okay?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.967
Where did they find her?

20:19.967 --> 20:22.567
A couple of those ufo
aficionados found her

20:22.567 --> 20:24.367
In the foothills about five miles west.

20:24.367 --> 20:26.268
Just lucky break.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.767
They were all out there looking for e.T.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.934
She could've been out there forever.

20:31.934 --> 20:34.600
I figure she was hiking along the ridge,

20:34.600 --> 20:38.300
Fell somehow, hit her
head, and died instantly.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.801
And then the coyotes
must've dragged the body

20:41.801 --> 20:44.534
About a mile, maybe
two, into the desert.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.367
Dr. Garcia's written "accidental death"

20:46.367 --> 20:47.934
On the certificate,

20:47.934 --> 20:50.101
But i asked him to write it in pencil

20:50.101 --> 20:51.767
Because i wanted to
get a second opinion.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.134
Why?

20:53.134 --> 20:54.901
It's a very small town, mr. Monk.

20:54.901 --> 20:56.834
And marge larkin was as close as we have

20:56.834 --> 20:58.901
To an important person.

20:58.901 --> 21:01.901
So, like i said, i
wanted to get this right.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.300
Yeah, please.

21:13.634 --> 21:14.734
So, head trauma.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.467
She fell face first.

21:36.567 --> 21:38.700
There's no defensive wounds.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.567
No... no scratches.

21:41.567 --> 21:48.333
So, she didn't put her
hands out when she fell.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.201
These clothes appear to be new.

21:57.201 --> 22:01.101
Sleeves are too short.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.567
And the treads on these boots,

22:18.567 --> 22:21.467
They're not warn down at all.

22:27.967 --> 22:29.834
What was that?

22:33.634 --> 22:35.600
Silicon packet.

22:35.600 --> 22:39.234
They sometimes put them in new boots.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.534
Well, she couldn't have been hiking,

22:41.534 --> 22:43.300
Not with that in her shoe.

22:44.634 --> 22:45.734
What does it mean?

22:48.534 --> 22:54.700
It means that somebody
dressed her after she was dead.

22:55.534 --> 22:57.900
After she was murdered.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.268
Thank you again for calling me.

23:03.268 --> 23:04.433
Of course we called you, kyle.

23:04.433 --> 23:05.934
You're her brother.

23:05.934 --> 23:07.867
Is there anybody else we should notify?

23:07.867 --> 23:10.268
No, it was just me and marge.

23:10.268 --> 23:12.067
Can't believe she kept all this junk.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.234
It's like a pawn shop.

23:13.234 --> 23:16.834
When was the last time you were here?

23:16.834 --> 23:19.734
6 1/2 years ago, my father's funeral.

23:19.734 --> 23:21.400
It's no secret.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.467
Marge and i, we weren't close.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.634
You...you never spoke.

23:27.634 --> 23:30.467
Oh, christmas, birthdays.

23:30.467 --> 23:32.600
Families, you know. It's complicated.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.333
Excuse me.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.001
Her plants are dying. Do you mind?

23:36.001 --> 23:37.367
Sure, thank you.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.268
Marge loved these plants.

23:39.268 --> 23:43.067
Wasn't crazy about people
but she loved her foliage.

23:43.067 --> 23:45.300
Last i heard you had
a shop in san diego.

23:45.300 --> 23:49.201
Yeah, it was fun while it lasted.

23:49.201 --> 23:51.433
I filed chapter 11 a year ago.

23:51.433 --> 23:52.534
Whole mall went under.

23:52.534 --> 23:53.700
You need a deputy?

23:53.700 --> 23:54.801
What is it?

23:54.801 --> 23:58.767
It's double-Sided tape.

23:58.767 --> 24:02.034
There was a rug here.

24:02.034 --> 24:03.867
What is that?

24:08.134 --> 24:10.667
It's from a shirt.

24:10.667 --> 24:14.534
A new shirt.

24:14.534 --> 24:17.567
I think she was killed here

24:17.567 --> 24:20.333
In this room.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.001
And then redressed.

24:22.001 --> 24:24.400
You really think someone
murdered my sister?

24:24.400 --> 24:28.067
Sheriff, i'd like to see
where they found the body.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.801
You hear that?

24:30.801 --> 24:32.467
What the hell is that?

24:36.400 --> 24:40.101
They think that mr.
Monk is from outer space.

24:46.433 --> 24:47.767
He's not.

24:53.001 --> 24:54.101
Hey!

24:54.101 --> 24:57.201
Get off the van, you freak!

24:57.201 --> 24:58.567
What's wrong with you?

24:58.567 --> 25:00.234
My sister just died.

25:00.234 --> 25:02.034
There he is!

25:02.034 --> 25:03.801
Where are you from?

25:03.801 --> 25:05.433
I was born in marin county.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.400
Really, he's not alien.
He's just persnickety.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.067
What is love? I don't know.

25:09.067 --> 25:10.101
What is the frequency?

25:10.101 --> 25:11.333
Uh, yeah, i don't know.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.767
Really, he doesn't know the frequency.

25:12.767 --> 25:13.801
Can we touch you?

25:13.801 --> 25:14.934
No, don't touch him!

25:14.934 --> 25:16.234
Our germs are poison to him!

25:16.234 --> 25:17.300
Actually, that one's kind of true.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.333
Please, monk,

25:18.333 --> 25:19.901
We've been waiting for so long.

25:19.901 --> 25:22.067
We just need some answers.
You just stay back.

25:22.067 --> 25:25.934
We've got some earth
business to take care of.

25:25.934 --> 25:28.667
Make him show you his belly button!

25:28.667 --> 25:29.767
Yeah, that's right!

25:34.400 --> 25:37.834
They found the body
here against this rock.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.634
The coyote tracks heading
west, but they're gone now.

25:39.634 --> 25:42.534
Can they drag a body that far?

25:42.534 --> 25:44.067
Oh, sure.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.367
I've seen them drag a
deer carcass seven miles.

25:46.534 --> 25:48.333
Listen.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.168
Somebody's here.

25:50.168 --> 25:53.034
Thought i saw something following us.

25:53.034 --> 25:56.534
Must be one of your ufo buddies.

25:56.534 --> 25:57.634
What the hell did you
say to them anyway?

25:57.634 --> 25:58.867
Nothing.

25:58.867 --> 25:59.967
I was just minding my own business.

25:59.967 --> 26:01.801
Was being myself.

26:01.801 --> 26:05.001
And suddenly everybody
wants to know the frequency.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.767
For the love of god, mr. Monk!

26:10.767 --> 26:12.168
Show them your belly button!

26:12.168 --> 26:14.101
Never! Get down!

26:14.101 --> 26:15.268
Get down! It's sandy.

26:15.268 --> 26:17.834
Well, just squat! Squat!

26:21.067 --> 26:22.667
Stay here.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.967
Oh, no!

26:26.967 --> 26:29.001
Oh, god! Look, you're bleeding!

26:29.001 --> 26:30.367
It's probably from the bullet.

26:32.567 --> 26:34.333
Wait, listen, listen.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.168
I think he's leaving.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.168
Come in.

26:44.168 --> 26:47.433
This is sheriff
fletcher. Hello, anybody?

26:47.433 --> 26:50.067
What about the cell? No signal.

26:50.067 --> 26:50.168
Well, at least he didn't kill us.

26:52.534 --> 26:53.934
Are we sure about that?

26:53.934 --> 26:56.967
Let's revue the situation, shall we?

26:56.967 --> 26:58.834
We're in the desert.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.801
No car, no radio.

27:00.801 --> 27:06.034
And coyotes...
face-Eating coyotes-

27:06.034 --> 27:09.067
And things that eat
the face-Eating coyotes,

27:09.067 --> 27:11.234
And things that eat
the things that eat...

27:11.234 --> 27:12.767
Yeah, we get it.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.268
He left us for dead.

27:14.268 --> 27:15.534
So what do we do?

27:15.534 --> 27:18.567
Well, i would very much
like to disappoint him.

27:18.567 --> 27:20.734
One of us is gonna have to go get help.

27:20.734 --> 27:24.034
The highway's about 15 miles that way.

27:24.034 --> 27:25.700
All right, natalie and i will go.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.534
Mr. Monk, we can't leave
him. He's been shot.

27:28.534 --> 27:29.634
Okay.

27:29.634 --> 27:31.101
Natalie and i will stay here.

27:31.101 --> 27:33.201
Mr. Monk, he can't walk.

27:33.201 --> 27:34.700
Well, what do you suggest, natalie?

27:34.700 --> 27:36.067
Do you have any ideas at all?

27:36.067 --> 27:37.101
Yeah.

27:37.101 --> 27:38.367
You get help.

27:38.367 --> 27:39.767
I stay here and take
care of the sheriff.

27:43.634 --> 27:45.001
Any ideas at all.

27:45.001 --> 27:46.400
Because if you do, i'd
really like to hear them.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.034
So, no ideas.

27:52.034 --> 27:54.400
Not a one.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.634
Are you okay?

28:25.634 --> 28:26.901
Just keep going, mr. Monk.

28:26.901 --> 28:29.867
You can do it!

28:35.201 --> 28:36.567
What are you doing?

28:36.567 --> 28:38.168
That's the only water
you have. Don't waste it!

28:38.168 --> 28:40.367
They're all sandy.

28:40.367 --> 28:42.300
No, mr. Monk. Save the water.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.667
Just go! Go!

29:05.134 --> 29:07.268
That's better.

30:15.300 --> 30:18.600
Here's what happened.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.168
Who are you talking to?

30:21.168 --> 30:22.600
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

30:22.600 --> 30:25.600
It's evidence. Let's take it with us.

30:37.634 --> 30:39.700
I usually have some candy in here.

30:39.700 --> 30:43.001
Here. Here's some breath mints.

30:44.867 --> 30:46.134
Is that it?

30:49.201 --> 30:54.433
I'm gonna ask you if that
was a coyote and you say no.

30:54.433 --> 30:57.567
Was that a coyote?

30:57.567 --> 30:58.867
No.

30:58.867 --> 31:00.834
Really, was it a coyote?

31:00.834 --> 31:02.500
Yeah.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.767
I'm sweating.

31:17.767 --> 31:19.801
Look, i'm sweating!

31:19.801 --> 31:22.600
Okay.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.667
I'm human.

31:25.667 --> 31:28.268
Not particularly proud of it.

31:28.268 --> 31:31.767
I'm human, okay?

31:31.767 --> 31:33.667
Oh, this is it.

31:33.667 --> 31:36.268
This is where it ends.

31:38.667 --> 31:41.101
This is it.

31:41.101 --> 31:43.667
Surrounded by dirt.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.901
Covered in dirt.

31:53.367 --> 31:54.734
You win, dirt!

31:54.734 --> 31:57.534
Congratulations, dirt!

32:00.101 --> 32:03.567
Well played.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.034
Oh, natalie, you were right.

32:05.034 --> 32:10.234
You called it. I'm dying alone.

32:10.234 --> 32:13.433
I don't want to die alone.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.734
I want people...

32:16.734 --> 32:19.400
People...

32:19.400 --> 32:21.934
Who said it...

32:21.934 --> 32:23.667
I like people.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.333
Gimme a chance!

32:25.333 --> 32:27.934
Just give me once more chance.

32:27.934 --> 32:30.400
I'll be nice. I'll be... i'll be good.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.700
I'll be... i'll be empathetic.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.400
I'll be the empathetic detective.

32:35.400 --> 32:40.300
Just...just send me some people!

32:40.300 --> 32:42.534
Please!

32:42.534 --> 32:44.067
I need people.

32:44.067 --> 32:47.268
People.

32:47.268 --> 32:49.801
People!

32:48.801 --> 32:52.300
There is!

32:54.801 --> 32:56.300
I need people.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.334
Doctor, doctor, i think he's awake.

33:06.334 --> 33:11.000
Mr. Monk?

33:14.601 --> 33:16.868
What did he say?

33:16.868 --> 33:19.133
"Floss."

33:19.133 --> 33:20.567
Floss?

33:20.567 --> 33:22.734
He means his teeth.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.200
Mr. Monk,

33:24.200 --> 33:26.067
You flossed your teeth
last night in the hospital

33:26.067 --> 33:28.367
For about three hours.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.033
Then you took a four-Hour shower.

33:30.033 --> 33:31.133
I don't think there's any hot water left

33:31.133 --> 33:32.434
In the whole state.

33:32.434 --> 33:34.167
Let's try this again.

33:34.167 --> 33:36.167
Adrian, when they found you,

33:36.167 --> 33:38.100
You were carrying this bag.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.434
You wouldn't let go of it.

33:40.434 --> 33:42.000
I think it's important.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.334
I'm looking at batteries,
engine lubricant,

33:44.334 --> 33:46.234
Eye glass wipes.

33:46.234 --> 33:47.767
I know what happened.

33:47.767 --> 33:51.334
You mean about the ufo
or about marge's murder?

33:51.334 --> 33:52.701
Both.

33:52.701 --> 33:54.300
It's all connected.

33:54.300 --> 33:58.767
The eye glass wipes,
they're kyle larkin's.

33:58.767 --> 34:00.133
He killed his sister.

34:00.133 --> 34:02.934
For the money, of course.

34:02.934 --> 34:05.100
He put her in a hiking outfit

34:05.100 --> 34:07.901
And dumped her body in the desert.

34:07.901 --> 34:09.868
It would look like an accident.

34:09.868 --> 34:12.234
Like she was out hiking,

34:12.234 --> 34:15.067
Lost her footing, and fell.

34:15.067 --> 34:16.234
As soon as anybody found the body,

34:16.234 --> 34:18.000
He'd be rich.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.300
He went home and waited for the call

34:20.300 --> 34:23.100
That his sister's body
had been discovered.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.501
But something was wrong.
The call never came.

34:26.501 --> 34:30.033
He realized the coyotes
must've dragged it away.

34:30.033 --> 34:33.367
Without the body, he
couldn't prove she was dead.

34:33.367 --> 34:36.167
He had to find it, but how?

34:36.167 --> 34:39.199
You said kyle owned a store.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.434
I could make out some of the lettering

34:41.434 --> 34:42.634
On the door of his van.

34:42.634 --> 34:46.333
It said "models and hobbies."

34:46.333 --> 34:48.167
That's right. He sold
kits for model trains.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.333
And airplanes.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.501
And airplanes.

34:52.501 --> 34:55.333
More.

35:04.467 --> 35:08.200
He needed somebody
else to find that body.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.701
Anybody else.

35:09.701 --> 35:11.934
So he build a ufo.

35:11.934 --> 35:14.534
It was a just a remote control model.

35:14.534 --> 35:18.133
Then he made what looked
like a landing site.

35:18.133 --> 35:21.868
He knew somebody would see
it and the news would spread.

35:21.868 --> 35:24.400
He knew the internet people would come.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.734
They believe anything.

35:27.734 --> 35:31.968
So basically he was putting
together a search party.

35:31.968 --> 35:33.033
He just needed people out there

35:33.033 --> 35:34.567
Looking around the desert.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.133
He knew someone would
eventually find his sister.

35:37.133 --> 35:40.467
It has been an honor
to watch you guys work.

35:40.467 --> 35:43.501
Mr. Monk, ms. Teeger,

35:43.501 --> 35:45.200
I am going to be forever grateful

35:45.200 --> 35:47.434
That your vehicle broke
down in my neck of the woods.

35:47.434 --> 35:49.133
But if you will excuse me,

35:49.133 --> 35:52.067
I have a suspect i need to go arrest.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.367
Heh, your fan club's here.

35:54.367 --> 35:56.667
They're gonna be mighty disappointed

35:56.667 --> 35:57.834
That none of this was real.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.400
I'll tell them.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.033
Let me... let me talk to them.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.868
Okay?

36:02.868 --> 36:04.501
Okay.

36:09.133 --> 36:12.801
Okay, natalie. Watch this.

36:36.234 --> 36:38.167
Hello, again.

36:38.167 --> 36:39.634
Hello.

36:39.634 --> 36:41.367
Hello, again. I have some good news.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.868
The object we saw was not a ufo.

36:43.868 --> 36:43.968
It was just a toy.

36:46.067 --> 36:48.767
I remote control model designed by a man

36:48.767 --> 36:51.000
Who murdered his sister.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.033
You'll read all about it
tomorrow in the newspaper.

36:53.033 --> 36:57.100
So you can all go now.

36:57.100 --> 36:58.567
Please, go home.

36:58.567 --> 37:00.801
Go, please.

37:00.801 --> 37:04.133
Stop wasting your time.

37:04.133 --> 37:07.734
Live life.

37:07.734 --> 37:11.901
Find, you know, employment and...

37:11.901 --> 37:13.868
Fall in love.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.300
You're human.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.634
Right?

37:16.634 --> 37:18.234
It's a gift.

37:18.234 --> 37:20.400
It's a precious, precious thing.

37:20.400 --> 37:25.400
You want to appreciate it.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.567
Okay, thank you.

37:28.567 --> 37:30.901
Mr. Monk, good for you.

37:30.901 --> 37:32.200
That was great.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.901
You were sensitive and respectful.

37:33.901 --> 37:35.834
That's the nicest
thing i've ever seen...

37:35.834 --> 37:37.133
Anyone? Not anyone, but you.

37:37.133 --> 37:39.667
The nicest thing i've ever seen you do.

37:45.133 --> 37:46.167
Is there a problem?

37:46.167 --> 37:48.067
You're not fooling anyone?

37:48.067 --> 37:49.467
Excuse me?

37:49.467 --> 37:51.400
We don't believe a word of that.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.067
Yeah, that was no model.

37:53.067 --> 37:55.267
And it's obviously a cover-Up.

37:55.267 --> 37:56.868
You're just trying to manipulate us.

37:58.667 --> 37:59.934
Yeah, we want the truth.

37:59.934 --> 38:02.901
Okay.

38:02.901 --> 38:05.100
Okay.

38:09.334 --> 38:12.100
Earth people of the net,

38:12.100 --> 38:14.601
You were right.

38:14.601 --> 38:19.534
I am not...

38:19.534 --> 38:22.767
Human.

38:22.767 --> 38:29.234
I traveled here to
your... how do you say?

38:29.234 --> 38:31.067
Planet...

38:31.067 --> 38:34.000
On a class four
intergalactic doom freighter.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.667
I knew it!

38:35.667 --> 38:38.133
I was sent to, you know,

38:38.133 --> 38:45.601
Prepare the way and to...observe things

38:45.601 --> 38:48.467
And probe things

38:49.601 --> 38:53.467
??????

39:01.567 --> 39:02.601
- Hello?
- Hello.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.734
You're in the paper today.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.501
Kyle larkin confessed
to killing his sister.

39:07.501 --> 39:08.800
He confessed to everything.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.234
I guess he didn't have any choice

39:10.234 --> 39:12.567
After all that evidence
they'd found in his van.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.734
What about the tinfoil brigade?

39:14.734 --> 39:15.967
Are they still out front?

39:15.967 --> 39:17.301
Just a few. Most of them went home.

39:17.301 --> 39:18.434
You need some help?

39:18.434 --> 39:20.601
No, no, i'm fine.

39:20.601 --> 39:22.267
Just cleaning.

39:22.267 --> 39:24.434
I haven't dusted up
here for two or three...

39:24.434 --> 39:26.200
Hours.

39:34.768 --> 39:36.634
What are you doing?

39:36.634 --> 39:38.167
Nothing.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.833
Were you trying to look inside my shirt?

39:39.833 --> 39:41.668
No, no.

39:41.668 --> 39:43.234
Oh, my god.

39:43.234 --> 39:45.234
You don't think i have a belly button.

39:45.234 --> 39:46.367
No!

39:47.900 --> 39:49.234
No.

39:49.234 --> 39:50.668
It's just ever since we got back,

39:50.668 --> 39:52.833
I've been having crazy dreams.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.267
About me, natalie?

39:54.267 --> 39:57.434
I'm not from outer space.

39:57.434 --> 40:00.167
I know. I'm sure you're not.

40:03.434 --> 40:04.434
Can i see it?

40:04.434 --> 40:05.967
No, you may not!

40:05.967 --> 40:08.501
Honestly.

40:08.501 --> 40:11.534
I am as human as anything in this room.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.701
See, right there. Right there!

40:13.701 --> 40:16.534
When you say things like
that, it doesn't make sense.

40:16.534 --> 40:20.367
Anybody would be curious.

40:20.367 --> 40:21.668
Just a peak! Just a peak! No!

40:21.668 --> 40:22.768
Get away from me!

40:22.768 --> 40:24.401
Come on, come on, come on! No!

40:24.401 --> 40:26.833
Why not? Because it's an outie?

40:26.833 --> 40:27.967
Come on, mr. Monk.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.434
You can't stay in there forever.

40:29.434 --> 40:30.634
Leave me alone.

40:30.634 --> 40:32.634
Mr. Monk, come on!

40:32.634 --> 40:37.967
Leave me alone or i will
destroy your whole planet.

40:39.867 --> 40:44.200
Mr. Monk, come on.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.134
Little peak. Little one, come on.
