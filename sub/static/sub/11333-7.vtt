Previously on 90210...
It's about Mom.

00:03.586 --> 00:05.547
What about her?
She's dying.

00:05.589 --> 00:08.550
What's best for Silver is
that you leave her alone.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.510
I'd like to move in with you.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.680
My kids
are juniors in high school.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.055
I actually have pictures.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.390
This is my son Dixon.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.809
College is a big decision.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.894
I will be going to
California University.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.562
CU isn't going to happen.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.897
You're going to focus
on the SATs?

00:21.939 --> 00:23.732
Yeah, no. I'm going to
date the dean's son.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.651
Are you Richard?
Naomi.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.986
I'm Jamie, by the way.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.069
Hey. There you are.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.196
Jamie, this is...

00:29.237 --> 00:30.238
My roommate, Richard.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.240
I actually thought
you had a crush

00:32.281 --> 00:33.659
on my husband.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.994
(chuckling)
What?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.370
Knock yourself out.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.579
Oh, perfect.
Thank you, Kelly.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.304
I know. Right?

01:36.346 --> 01:39.641
Dude, this blows.
I just snapped a fin.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.684
Who cares about your fin?

01:40.726 --> 01:41.977
I got a big dent in my car.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.979
Relax, man.
It's just a dent.

01:44.021 --> 01:44.980
A big dent.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.816
What, like $500 tops?

01:47.858 --> 01:49.985
You want some cash? I'm
totally cool to split it.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.570
I don't want your money.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.697
Okay...

01:53.739 --> 01:55.282
So, what do you want?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.158
Uh, an apology.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.327
You hit me. I saw you
backing out and I stopped.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.080
Well, then this would
be your fault, too. No?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.790
Why are you stopping in the
middle of the parking lot?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.499
Are you seriously blaming me?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.334
Well, clearly,
I didn't see you.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.962
Well, maybe that's because
you're a little girl

02:08.002 --> 02:10.505
who's driving a car that's
clearly too big for you.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.715
Right.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.303
You know what, dude? Maybe
I do owe you an apology.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.515
I am so sorry that you
are such a sexist ass.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.850
You know, screw you!

02:21.892 --> 02:24.269
Oh, right back at you, loser.

02:32.903 --> 02:36.156
RICHARD: All right,
so for today's main attraction,

02:36.197 --> 02:38.575
you want to go Journey Earth
Jungles or Caves?

02:38.617 --> 02:40.744
Uh, which one's shorter?

02:40.786 --> 02:44.915
More time for our
post-film discussion.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.208
I like the way
you think, babe.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.711
Let's go Caves. There's supposed
to be some sick shots

02:49.753 --> 02:51.338
of hydrogen-eating bacteria.

02:51.379 --> 02:56.343
So, does your mom love the
environment as much as you do?

02:56.384 --> 02:57.886
My mom? Yeah, right.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.262
Been trying to get the
admissions office

02:59.304 --> 03:00.388
to go paperless forever.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.349
Well, maybe we should
double-team her.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.352
Try to convince her
to go green together.

Hey, Jamie.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.193
So...

03:14.235 --> 03:15.737
I, uh, calculated
the electric bill.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.197
Looks like you're
responsible for about 2/3.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.742
Not a problem.
What do I owe you?

03:20.784 --> 03:23.078
It's not what you owe me, man.
It's what you owe the planet.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.497
Just need a dollar amount,
Richard.

to hop in the shower.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.212
Oh, no.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.841
Yeah, watching people drink
out of red plastic cups

03:35.883 --> 03:38.052
just kind of makes me
want to barf.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.511
Mmm.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.890
How oblivious is that guy?

03:42.931 --> 03:43.891
(chuckles)

03:43.932 --> 03:45.266
He takes, like,
two showers a day.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.267
Doesn't he know
we live in a desert?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.394
Duh.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.730
People who shower
a lot are so gross.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.314
God, you're great.

03:51.356 --> 03:56.528

Should we double-team your mom?

for calling you Kelly,

man. You're off the team.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.637
What?!

10:37.678 --> 10:38.805
You're obviously
not committed.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.973
No. No, I am!

10:40.014 --> 10:42.142
Look, I just had a...
a family emergency.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.978
It won't happen again.
Please.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.396
Just-Just give me
one more chance, man.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.273
This team
means so much to me.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.317
Please.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.112
IVY: Anyways, so then we find
out that my house in Malibu

10:54.154 --> 10:55.614
burnt down 'cause of those...
those brush fires.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.823
MICHAEL: Your house
burned down?
Yeah.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.325
No way!
Yeah, and get this.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.494
We don't even find out for,
like, another three days.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.662
We were hanging out with, like,
Ray LaMontagne and Ben Harper,

11:02.703 --> 11:05.832
and Ben was, like, "Dude,
I think your house burnt down."

11:05.873 --> 11:07.834
And I was, like,
"Dude, who cares?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.253
It's just a house."

11:10.295 --> 11:12.255
Excuse me?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.299
Okay, guys,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.468
gather up!

11:16.510 --> 11:19.429
How'd it go?

11:19.471 --> 11:23.517
Well, um, I'm on probation,
but I'm still on the team.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.518
Man, I was sweating

11:24.559 --> 11:26.603
back there.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.104
So, the antes

11:28.146 --> 11:29.648
just went up for tomorrow.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.775
Billabong has donated
a limited-edition

11:32.817 --> 11:35.195
handmade board,
which is gonna go to the rider

11:35.236 --> 11:36.863
with the highest
all-around score.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.157
Shut... up!
Pretty gnarly, huh?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.618
So let's get in the water,
let's make this practice count!

11:41.660 --> 11:43.786
Okay? Let's go!

11:45.746 --> 11:48.667
Man, you know, I could
really use that board,
since some douche bag

11:48.707 --> 11:51.503
damaged mine.
You know it was

11:51.545 --> 11:52.546
your fault.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.214
Why don't you just apologize?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.715
I am happy to, once
you apologize for
being a sexist pig.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.511
You're out of your mind.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.305
Oh, my God...

12:02.347 --> 12:03.890
you're right.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.975
I've totally been
acting crazy, huh?

12:06.017 --> 12:08.311
Sorry.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.605
It's just, um...

12:10.647 --> 12:13.066
I'm on my...
my period, you know?

12:14.775 --> 12:17.736
Oh. Um... yeah.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.614
Yeah, no... problem.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.160
(chuckles)

12:24.202 --> 12:24.994
Wow.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.205
You actually bought that.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.667
Dude, you are worse
than I thought you were.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.919
Laters.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.548
♪ ♪

12:45.473 --> 12:47.684
Uh-oh.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.143
Oh.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.730
What would Richard
think about this?

12:51.770 --> 12:52.980
What was I thinking?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.524
I cannot believe I did that.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.942
Okay, Naomi,

12:55.983 --> 12:58.403
come on, what are you... what
are you doing with Richard?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.779
Hmm?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.283
I mean, he's so...

13:03.324 --> 13:05.285
not your type.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.455
I... He's nice.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.789
We're getting
to know each other.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.459
Mm. Okay.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.295
Let me walk you to your car.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.134
So, I'm sitting here
with my grandfather
at a football game,

13:21.175 --> 13:24.262
and I must've been,
like, six or seven,

13:24.304 --> 13:27.223
and the first thing I'm thinking
is, "Ew, maroon and black?

13:27.265 --> 13:28.849
I hate those colors together."

13:28.891 --> 13:30.644
But then
the cheerleaders came out

13:30.685 --> 13:33.313
and the marching band
did their thing, and...

13:33.354 --> 13:35.022
everyone was just
yelling and screaming.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.610
They were so into it-- by
the end of the day, I was, like,

13:38.652 --> 13:42.863
"You know, Grandpa, maroon and
black aren't so bad after all."

13:42.905 --> 13:45.742
Oh, that's when I knew
I was smitten with CU.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.411
Mm. You know, it's funny,
I remember the first time

13:48.453 --> 13:51.498
that I realized that I didn't
mind the school colors.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.831
When?

13:52.873 --> 13:54.000
Oh, uh,

13:54.041 --> 13:55.460
you were kidding.
Yeah, I'm kidding.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.836
Maybe a little.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.340
So, are you and your
grandfather close?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.591
We were, yeah.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.843
He-he passed away
five years ago, so...

14:04.885 --> 14:06.346
I'm sorry.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.349
Yeah, it sucked.
(chuckles)

14:09.390 --> 14:11.850
We always had a really
special connection.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.061
I was kind of
his favorite.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.147
(chuckles):
Well, I'm...

14:16.189 --> 14:18.941
I'm sure you're
lots of people's favorite.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.151
(laughs softly)

14:26.825 --> 14:29.035
Man, I wish...
(laughs)

14:29.076 --> 14:30.704
I wish you
weren't dating Richard,

14:30.745 --> 14:33.039
because I...
I really want to kiss you.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.631
But you are, so I... I won't.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.388
(whispers):
We should get going.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.266
(whispers):
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.529
So, uh...

15:04.571 --> 15:06.531
do you need a
ride to school?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.033
Nope. I have a ride.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.285
With that guy
you been hanging out with?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.080
Um, Jasper--
is that his name?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.874
Yeah. Why?

15:15.915 --> 15:19.210
I don't know, he just... seems
a little sketchy, that's all.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.545
Do you even know him?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.213
No, but...

15:22.255 --> 15:24.883
He doesn't hang out with
the West Beverly kids

15:24.924 --> 15:27.260
because they're all
judgmental lemmings...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.470
like you.
Annie, like...

15:29.512 --> 15:30.722
No, it's true.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.807
And-And who are you to be
calling someone sketchy?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.642
If anyone's sketchy
around here, it's you.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.228
What's that supposed to mean?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.522
It means you've been sneaking
out of the house at night,

15:39.564 --> 15:41.399
going who knows where,
lying to Mom and Dad.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.902
And where have
you been going?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.737
(chuckles)

15:45.779 --> 15:48.531
Exactly. Sketchy, like I said.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.577
Oh, it's so unfair, okay?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.078
Jamie is, like,
the perfect guy,

15:54.120 --> 15:55.747
and I'm stuck with smelly,
shower-hating Richard.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.708
You're not stuck with him--
you can always end your
fake relationship.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.334
And not get into
CU? Yeah, no.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.588
Come on, it's not like
Richard has even invited
you to meet his mom.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.172
Oh, no, he did--
he called me this morning.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.424
She's throwing
some kind of cocktail party.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.592
Ostensibly, we're
gonna stop her

16:07.634 --> 16:09.260
from using paper
napkins, but still...

16:09.302 --> 16:10.553
Wow.
Yeah.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.180
So I have to put Jamie out
of my mind, completely,

16:13.222 --> 16:15.349
end of story, because look
what happened to you.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.227
You went after some shiny pretty
boy and got stuck with nothing.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.438
I can't do that.
Thanks for that.
Thank you.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.607
I just mean, I can't let
myself get distracted

16:22.649 --> 16:26.277
by rock-hard abs and
thighs that have driven
countries to war.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.239
Okay, what country has ever
been driven to war over thighs?

16:30.281 --> 16:32.450
Look, I'm sorry that
the agency double-booked you,

16:32.492 --> 16:35.119
but I really...
I have to have a nurse tonight.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.664
(bell ringing)
Last night it was just me,
and I can't...

16:37.705 --> 16:39.373
Shoot. Um, I have to go, okay?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.292
But I'm gonna call you back
after class.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.544
Just please,
try to make it work. Thanks.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.008
KRUMHOLTZ:
All right, everyone,

16:49.049 --> 16:51.761
I'll collect
your projects now.

16:51.803 --> 16:52.762
Thank you.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.555
Thank you.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.975
Um...

16:57.016 --> 16:58.768
I... I actu...

16:58.810 --> 17:00.311
uh, I forgot it.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.312
I...
It's okay.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.439
You don't have
to cover for me.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.358
We worked at my
house last night,

17:05.398 --> 17:07.318
and I forgot the
project at home.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.737
Silver even called
to remind me, but
I just flaked.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.490
Sorry.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.575
Bring it in tomorrow.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.327
Teddy, you'll
be penalized

17:16.368 --> 17:17.912
a whole grade.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.291
See? (chuckles)

17:23.334 --> 17:25.461
Told you I wasn't
a bad guy.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.253
No one asked you to do that.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.928
(knocking)

17:33.970 --> 17:35.680
Come in.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.806
Hi.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.808
Uh, hang on one sec.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.686
(clears throat softly)

17:41.728 --> 17:44.355
Now, I assume
that you are here

17:44.397 --> 17:46.691
to talk to the President about
health care reform.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.694
(chuckles):
Senior evals, actually.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.821
Oh, well, you've come up
with any new

17:51.863 --> 17:55.366
and exciting ways to
trick colleges into
accepting our slackers?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.910
You okay?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.330
Kelly, what's going on?

18:01.372 --> 18:04.042
It's... it's Silver.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.209
She okay?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.003
Yeah. No.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.046
I don't know.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.714
She moved out.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.717
Our mom has cancer,
and she moved out.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.010
What?

18:14.052 --> 18:17.013
(groans): I can't really
talk about it right now.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.723
I have to get
to a meeting.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.141
Um, maybe we
could grab...

18:21.183 --> 18:22.226
lunch later.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.895
I could use somebody to talk to.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.397
Yeah, of course.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.440
Okay. Thanks.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.113
(sighs)

18:40.078 --> 18:41.328
Hey, hon.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.664
DEBBIE:
Hey. What's up?
Um, bad news.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.959
I'm swamped here.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.044
Could we reschedule our lunch?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.754
Sure. No problem.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.922
(groans)

18:50.964 --> 18:53.257
Maybe we can go as the Rat Pack.

18:53.299 --> 18:57.720
Right. Like you're
even gonna show.

18:57.762 --> 18:58.930
You've been
ditching everything lately.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.432
I'll be there,
all right?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.393
I was thinking maybe
I could be Sinatra.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.896
And Liam could be
Sammy Davis Jr.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.106
(laughing)

19:08.188 --> 19:10.942
Yeah, I don't...
really do Halloween.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.610
That's lame, man.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.572
Think Navid'll come?
Nah. I don't think

19:16.614 --> 19:18.116
he wants to run into Ade.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.077
(phone ringing)
Hold on,
hold on.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.245
Uh... got to take this.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.789
Come on, man.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.126
Hello?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.128
SASHA:
Hey, baby. So, um,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.630
I got a gig tonight that's
gonna go late, so I was thinking

19:32.672 --> 19:34.132
that you could come by
after school.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.135
Uh, I-I can't; I have
a surf meet later on today.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.511
Okay, well,
just come by after that.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.595
I don't leave until 9:00.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.723
Um...

19:44.017 --> 19:45.810
You see, there...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.812
there's this
Halloween party that...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.647
I kind of wanted to hit.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.649
You'd rather go
to a high school Halloween party

19:51.691 --> 19:52.817
than be with me?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.152
No. No. Uh...

19:54.193 --> 19:55.444
you know, it's just that

19:55.486 --> 19:57.321
I haven't really
been able to hang out

19:57.363 --> 19:59.866
with my friends lately,
and I don't want to ditch them.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.409
Come on, baby, you hang out
with your friends every day,

20:02.451 --> 20:03.995
while I hardly
ever get to see you.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.287
(beep)

20:05.329 --> 20:07.123
Oh. You know what? Shoot.
This is call-waiting.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.916
Look, I'll-I'll see you
at 6:00, okay?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.501
Bye.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.505
KELLY:
I know she's dying,

20:14.547 --> 20:17.050
but that doesn't erase
all the damage she's done.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.582
I omitted.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.876
Okay, I lied, but only because
you're so sensitive about Kelly.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.002
Because she has
a crush on you.
You're wrong.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.046
I'm not. And you know
what's even worse,

32:03.088 --> 32:05.173
is you're playing into it.
Her mother is dying.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.008
I know. I am sorry
for that, I am,

32:07.050 --> 32:09.135
but she should not be going
to her married boss

32:09.177 --> 32:10.262
with her problems.
Deb...

32:10.303 --> 32:11.388
No, listen to me.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.431
She likes you.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.973
That's why she's
confiding in you.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.560
And you need to stop being so
obtuse and face what's going on.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.061
I'm going to yoga.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.063
I need to calm down.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.777
(sighs)

32:32.785 --> 32:33.827
Hey.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.748
What are you doing here?

32:37.790 --> 32:39.917
Look, I know you
don't like me,

32:39.958 --> 32:43.420
but I heard about your mom.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.422
I'm really sorry.
Save it.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.549
I don't need your pity.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.509
I'm not here to pity you.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.886
We're not friends.
I know.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.053
So why are you here?

32:52.095 --> 32:56.349
Because...

32:56.391 --> 32:58.226
My mom died three years ago.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.187
Thought you might

33:01.229 --> 33:04.900
want to talk to someone who
knows what you're going through.

33:04.942 --> 33:08.111
But... I get it.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.446
You don't.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.239
Wait.

33:15.619 --> 33:20.332
I don't... don't want to talk.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.250
I mean...

33:24.586 --> 33:26.463
I do.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.551
So that's why you
moved back East,

33:31.593 --> 33:32.719
to take care
of your mom?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.513
Yeah.

33:34.554 --> 33:38.141
It was like I was living this
weird double life, you know?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.267
When I was at school,

33:39.309 --> 33:42.020
I thought about things like
tests and parties.

33:42.061 --> 33:44.356
But... back home,

33:44.397 --> 33:47.192
it was all oxygen
and nebulizers.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.278
Yeah, I know what you mean.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.657
Everyone, my friends,
my sister,

33:53.699 --> 33:56.451
they just, they
just don't get it.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.245
I mean, they think that
I'm taking on too much.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.122
But...
How could you live
with yourself

34:01.164 --> 34:03.041
if you weren't there for her?

34:03.082 --> 34:04.543
Exactly.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.420
I don't, I don't
know how long

34:08.463 --> 34:10.340
we have left.

34:12.509 --> 34:16.094
I keep trying to build some
sort of a relationship...

34:16.137 --> 34:18.097
Trust me, I get it.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.976
Doesn't mean
it's not hard as hell.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.062
(chuckles)

34:24.103 --> 34:27.649
I-I've been working so hard
not to admit that, you know?

34:27.690 --> 34:28.900
I just,

34:28.942 --> 34:30.569
I don't want everyone

34:30.610 --> 34:33.237
to jump down my
throat and say "See?

34:33.279 --> 34:34.489
You can't handle it."

34:34.531 --> 34:36.324
You can handle it.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.877
It just gets so
overwhelming, you know?

34:48.545 --> 34:52.130
Sometimes, I just...

34:52.172 --> 34:53.717
I just want to scream.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.346
Come on.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.016
Come on.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.351
(chuckles)
Um...

35:03.393 --> 35:05.854
I'm gonna show you
how I used to blow off steam.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.361
♪ ♪

35:13.403 --> 35:14.696
(clears throat)

35:14.738 --> 35:16.698
You won this,
fair and square.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.034
Thanks.

35:19.076 --> 35:20.285
Yep.

35:20.326 --> 35:23.038
And, look,
you're a really good surfer.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.831
Thank you.
For a girl.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.458
Dude, what is your deal?

35:26.499 --> 35:27.375
It's like you really...

35:28.501 --> 35:29.920
You're kidding?

35:29.962 --> 35:30.837
Right.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.090
Whatever, dude.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.634
So I might be slightly sensitive
to gender stereotypes, okay?

35:35.675 --> 35:36.969
Oh, slightly?

35:37.010 --> 35:39.554
Dude, growing up surfing,
I just had to prove myself

35:39.596 --> 35:42.057
to the guys,
over and over and over again.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.851
It was just, it was a pain
in the ass, you know?

35:44.893 --> 35:49.188
Just constantly being...
underestimated or whatever.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.607
Whoa, wait.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.734
Just so we're clear, I never
underestimated you, okay?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.402
I know you're
a great surfer.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.237
I also know you are

35:56.279 --> 35:58.073
lousy with apologies.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.408
Great.
Are we back to the car?

36:00.450 --> 36:01.284
We're back to the car.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.953
Why is it so important to you

36:02.995 --> 36:04.412
that I apologize?

36:04.454 --> 36:07.082
Let's just say
I've been underestimated, too.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.084
What, people assume
you're a bad driver?

36:09.126 --> 36:11.461
People assume I'm bad, period.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.421
So, when something's
not my fault,

36:13.463 --> 36:15.340
I don't like to be
blamed for it.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.848
I'm sorry I hit you.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.432
It was my fault.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.892
Thank you.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.894
Can I just say one more thing?

36:27.936 --> 36:29.562
Hmm?

36:29.604 --> 36:31.189
I would have
kicked your ass today

36:31.230 --> 36:32.607
if I hadn't started showing off.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.776
And if it was a girls-
only competition.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.777
You are...

36:35.819 --> 36:37.112
(laughs)

36:47.831 --> 36:48.832
What?

36:48.874 --> 36:49.833
Nothing. What?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.292
Are we have a
staring contest?

36:51.334 --> 36:52.460
No, dude.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.629
But, I mean, if we were,
I would totally win.

36:54.671 --> 36:55.797
Okay.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.798
Yeah, you're crazy.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.050
Okay.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.051
Bye.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.093
Later on.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.469
Screw all of them!

37:01.511 --> 37:04.014
Let's just take the car
and-and never come back.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.140
I'm serious.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.684
We'll disappear,
just the two of us.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.685
JASPER:
Great. Okay.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.936
Now, now, get
to the car.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.646
You're reckless,
you're free.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.150
Keys.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.484
(laughs)

37:16.526 --> 37:17.485
Go.

37:17.527 --> 37:20.155
(sighs)

37:20.197 --> 37:21.656
That was perfect.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.158
You are a
natural, babe.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.159
How did it feel?

37:24.201 --> 37:25.160
Reckless.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.161
Free!
(laughs):
Yeah?

37:26.203 --> 37:27.162
Well, let's go.

37:27.204 --> 37:28.663
Fire it up,
floor it.
(sighs)

37:28.705 --> 37:30.582
Yeah!

37:30.623 --> 37:33.376
(whooping)
Yeah!

37:33.418 --> 37:35.503
NEWSCASTER:
...seasonal temperatures, we
should reach our normal high

37:35.545 --> 37:37.964
of about 82.
ANNOUNCER: ...month is over,
you'll get five free...

37:38.006 --> 37:39.883
(cell phone ringing)

37:44.554 --> 37:45.555
Hey, Kel.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.681
Oh, hey.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.600
Um, I was just calling
to check in.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.228
Want to make sure
everything was okay.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.312
Debbie seemed a little upset
when she left earlier,

37:53.354 --> 37:55.982
and I would hate if it had
anything to do with me.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.026
Actually, it did.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.903
(chuckles)

37:59.945 --> 38:02.864
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

38:02.906 --> 38:06.618
Debbie has it in her head
that you have a crush on me.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.204
(chuckles)

38:09.246 --> 38:11.123
That's ridiculous.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.502
Yeah, it is.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.338
Listen, I-I got to, I got to go.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.216
We'll talk later, okay?

38:21.258 --> 38:23.093
All right.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.016
(sighs)

38:30.058 --> 38:31.893
Seriously, with the sighing?

38:31.935 --> 38:33.895
(groans)
I just want to go home.

38:33.937 --> 38:34.896
You know, I
thought going

38:34.938 --> 38:36.106
to a Halloween party would

38:36.148 --> 38:38.733
take my mind off of Navid,
but it hasn't.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.694
Just wait until
my date gets here, okay?

38:41.736 --> 38:44.239
Channel Marilyn; she suffered
a lot in her lifetime.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.241
Marilyn never loved
and lost Navid.

38:46.283 --> 38:47.784
Well, she was pretty
torn up over JFK.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.037
JFK was no Navid, I know.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.413
(groans)

38:52.455 --> 38:56.084
Actually, on second thought,
you can go home, Marilyn.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.295
My date's arrived.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.048
♪ ♪

39:02.090 --> 39:03.049
(chuckles)

39:03.091 --> 39:04.050
Okay, wait a second.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.260
That's Richard?

39:05.302 --> 39:06.594
He totally looks
like he showers.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.429
No, that's Jamie.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.430
Hi.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.057
Hey, you.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.934
I'm glad you called.
NAOMI:
I'm glad you came.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.811
Um, my friend
was just leaving.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.313
I'm gonna walk her out.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.148
I'll be right back.
Okay.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.024
NAOMI:
Okay.

39:22.194 --> 39:24.070
ADRIANNA:
Um, okay, I am

39:24.112 --> 39:25.322
totally confused.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.823
I broke up with Richard.

39:26.865 --> 39:27.866
Apparently. Why?

39:27.907 --> 39:28.992
What happened?

39:29.034 --> 39:32.871
I saw Liam with this girl,
looking all romantic.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.080
(sighs)

39:34.122 --> 39:35.581
And I got upset and messed up,

39:35.623 --> 39:37.917
and I don't want to be
upset and messed up anymore.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.002
And then it hit me.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.586
I'm never gonna get over him

39:40.628 --> 39:42.130
if I'm in a fake relationship,

39:42.172 --> 39:43.215
you know?

39:43.256 --> 39:45.424
Whereas with Jamie,
I really see potential.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.135
He could be the real
getting-over-Liam deal,

39:47.177 --> 39:48.303
you know?

39:48.345 --> 39:49.971
I just have to give him a shot.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.681
Even if it means

39:51.723 --> 39:53.808
studying to get into college.

39:53.850 --> 39:54.851
(groans)

39:54.893 --> 39:56.728
Well, I think you did
the right thing.

39:58.855 --> 39:59.814
Yeah, me, too.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.524
(chuckles softly)

40:01.566 --> 40:03.484
Oh, you see him in shorts!
Those thighs.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.278
Countries have gone
to war, I know.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.279
(both laugh)

40:06.321 --> 40:07.697
I know.

(grunts)

40:21.794 --> 40:23.129
Even harder.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.339
Really smack it.

40:24.381 --> 40:25.257
(grunts)

40:26.632 --> 40:28.843
It's the only way you're
gonna feel better.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.555
(grunts)
(chuckles):
Nice.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.514
(grunting continues)

40:41.606 --> 40:42.523
Even harder.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.026
(grunts)

40:45.068 --> 40:45.818
(grunts)

40:45.860 --> 40:47.695
Watch out.

40:47.737 --> 40:48.696
(grunts)

40:48.738 --> 40:50.073
(chuckles):
Ooh.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.328
(chuckles)

40:55.370 --> 40:57.872
Oh.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.503
Sasha?

41:04.545 --> 41:06.714
What are you
doing here?

41:06.756 --> 41:09.008
First, I want to apologize.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.010
I know I've been
kind of needy lately.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.345
No, look,

41:12.387 --> 41:14.055
look, it's okay.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.766
That's not why
I ended things at all.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.894
I just feel like we're in two
different places in our life.

41:19.936 --> 41:24.523
Um, well, we're gonna need to
find a way to get in sync.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.653
Because...

41:28.694 --> 41:30.155
I'm pregnant.
