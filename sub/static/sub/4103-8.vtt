sc rea m. . .

00:09.910 --> 00:11.104
I was a bet?

00:11.110 --> 00:12.509
No, em, i love you!

00:12.510 --> 00:14.068
We're done.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.604
Kieran:
You 5177/ ha ve
feelings for him?

00:15.610 --> 00:17.703
We were together
for a long time.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.905
Have either of you
guys seen will?

00:19.920 --> 00:20.602
(phone rings)

00:20.620 --> 00:23.612
/(/ller.'
Hello, emma.
Ill/'ssmg someth/hg?

00:27.660 --> 00:28.718
Where is he?

00:28.720 --> 00:30.756
Will has been
blackmailing my dad.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.422
What you saw is
not what it looks like.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.954
Emma:
If he wants
me to ﬁnd WIll,

00:34.960 --> 00:37.292
Why not just leave
the door open?

00:37.300 --> 00:38.119
Classic cat and mouse.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.769
He likes to play with his
food before he eats it.

00:40.970 --> 00:43.029
Emma: Hello? Will?

00:43.040 --> 00:44.439
(thudding)

00:44.440 --> 00:45.930
(screams)

00:46.680 --> 00:48.033
Emma: Will!

00:48.040 --> 00:51.646
(sobbing) no. Jake!

00:51.650 --> 00:53.299
Emma: It's a tape of my dad.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.117
"ptsd project".

00:55.120 --> 00:58.112
/(e Vin:
But how could
she sleep with that monster?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.849
Emma: Mom!
Are you hurt?

00:59.860 --> 01:00.610
(phone rings)

01:00.620 --> 01:03.054
I saved your life yesterday.
W/ll:
You should come over.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.120
/(/ller.'
But this Is going
to he a date to remember.

01:06.130 --> 01:07.893
I suggest you run.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.857
(grunting)

01:14.670 --> 01:17.798
Maggie:
The body of
17-year-old WIll he/mont

01:17.810 --> 01:21.132
Was discovered
by emma o’uval.

01:27.180 --> 01:32.686
The decedent was the only son
of earl and ade/Ine be/mont.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.196
Though there was
catastrophic physical trauma,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.998
The decedents mother was
able to ident/ﬁ/ h/m

01:46.000 --> 01:49.128
By the clothing he
had been wearing.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.470
(inaudible)

02:00.580 --> 02:02.810
You can tell me anything.

02:02.820 --> 02:07.211
Did you see a face?
Did you see his face?

02:07.420 --> 02:09.251
Did he say
anything to you?

02:09.260 --> 02:12.684
Please think,
you gotta tell
us something.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.295
Doctor: I'm gonna prescribe
something for you
that will help you sleep

02:16.300 --> 02:17.995
And just take
the edge off.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.992
Have you ever been
on anti-depressants?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.865
How are you feeling?

02:24.340 --> 02:27.229
Kevin:
I can ’1‘ get that
Image out of m y head

02:27.440 --> 02:29.908
l-lid/ng in that
bowling alley.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.049
I know i let her down.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.844
I know i hurt her.

02:34.850 --> 02:38.217
But how could she
sleep with that monster?

02:38.220 --> 02:39.915
(tape rewinds)

02:39.920 --> 02:42.889
But how could she sleep
with that monster?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.653
(tape rewinds)

02:44.660 --> 02:47.788
But how could she sleep
with that monster?

02:50.630 --> 02:53.622
(beeping)

02:59.810 --> 03:00.731
(soft chuckle)

03:00.740 --> 03:04.471
Hey.
Is he gonna be okay?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.443
(sighs) yeah.

03:06.980 --> 03:09.949
He's just sleeping
off his pain meds.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.838
Doctors say it was
some kind of miracle

03:11.850 --> 03:14.683
It missed his
major organs.

03:14.890 --> 03:15.811
That's good.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.425
Yeah. He should be up by now.

03:18.430 --> 03:21.251
I'm gonna go get
some answers.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.090
So, unconscious jake.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.069
The things i want
to say to you.

03:35.910 --> 03:39.209
It was me who tagged
your 400-horsepower,

03:39.220 --> 03:41.745
Check-me-out
monster truck,

03:41.750 --> 03:44.548
And it was awesome.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.023
Are you trying to give
me the coma finger?

03:52.030 --> 03:54.328
(grunting)

03:56.600 --> 03:57.965
Nerd.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.190
What happened?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.197
We make it?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.363
Uh, yeah.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.031
Yeah, we got out.

04:06.040 --> 04:06.734
Let me guess,

04:06.740 --> 04:11.575
Emma went all
florence nightingale
on will's ass.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.573
And then fell in love with
that dumb hayseed again.

04:15.580 --> 04:20.313
And now they're out
making sweet, sweet love...

04:20.320 --> 04:22.811
Uh, not exactly...

04:28.600 --> 04:30.295
Hey, there...

04:33.800 --> 04:35.336
How's will?

04:44.610 --> 04:48.444
(indistinct whispering)
what?

04:50.490 --> 04:53.482
(both crying)

05:02.100 --> 05:03.590
(door opening)

05:07.570 --> 05:09.697
I didn't know
you were up.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.439
School starts at 8:00.

05:11.940 --> 05:12.804
You're going to school?

05:12.810 --> 05:14.505
Everyone's going
back today.

05:14.510 --> 05:17.729
I'm sure they'll understand
if you don't feel up to it.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.445
Mom, i feel fine.

05:19.450 --> 05:20.849
(sighs)

05:21.420 --> 05:23.809
Did the meds
help you sleep?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.946
I don't need to sleep.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.919
I need to not be
questioned by the doctors,

05:28.920 --> 05:31.252
And the police and you.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.057
I need to go back
to normal life.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.496
Honey, what you went
through was horrific.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.225
I understand how
you feel, but trust me,

05:40.240 --> 05:43.061
Normal's going
to take some time.

05:43.070 --> 05:46.858
Will's dead.
Time doesn't
change that.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.508
Well, let me
drive you to school.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.908
Mom, the deputy is waiting.

05:54.120 --> 05:54.779
Right.

05:54.780 --> 05:59.843
Well, um,
take_ these.
Just In case.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.450
I'm here for you.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.486
(stutters)
if you need anything.
I know.

06:08.930 --> 06:12.024
(door opens and closes)

06:16.970 --> 06:19.507
(indistinct chatter)

06:19.510 --> 06:20.738
Sheriff hudson,

06:20.740 --> 06:21.934
Could i have
a moment?

06:21.940 --> 06:23.805
I'll have a press
statement later today.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.074
No, i don't want
any information.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.571
_I'm here to
gIve you some.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.972
About what?

06:33.790 --> 06:34.586
Hudson: Is this a joke?

06:34.590 --> 06:38.959
Piper: No. This is
time-stamped footage from the
mayor's own security system.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.258
Hacked by two kids
who are now dead.

06:41.260 --> 06:43.125
Nina patterson
and tyler o'neill.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.028
Where'd you get this?

06:44.030 --> 06:46.999
From one of the kids
who was blackmailing
him with it, will belmont.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.867
The other, jake fitzgerald,
is luclq to be alive.

06:49.870 --> 06:53.306
You think that the mayor
killed will belmont?

06:53.310 --> 06:54.129
I don't know.

06:54.140 --> 06:57.007
But i do know that will went
to go meet him the other night

06:57.010 --> 06:59.399
To return this video.
I was there.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.240
He handed it off,
the mayor left,

07:01.250 --> 07:04.549
And then the killer
appeared, who gave me this

07:04.550 --> 07:07.110
And then
dragged will off.

07:07.490 --> 07:10.687
(sighs) i can't believe
that quinn maddox

07:10.690 --> 07:11.884
Could have
done all of this.

07:11.890 --> 07:16.395
Maybe not. But he's
definitely moving
some body in that video.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.459
Why aren't you
podcasting this?

07:18.470 --> 07:22.759
Because i don't want
to tell this story until
i know the truth.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.762
And i don't want
anybody else to die.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.738
Including me.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.502
(sighs) hmm.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.813
(indistinct chatter)

07:40.090 --> 07:43.116
Emma, hey!
Hey.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.195
What?
Um...

07:51.200 --> 07:53.168
You're here.
I am.

07:53.170 --> 07:57.834
We just didn't expect
to see you back so soon.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.708
I stopped by
to check on you.

08:01.910 --> 08:05.004
Yeah, thanks.
My mom told me.

08:05.550 --> 08:08.314
Emma, there
are no words...

08:08.320 --> 08:09.719
I mean, i'm sure
there are,

08:09.720 --> 08:11.540
But i can't think
of any to...

08:11.550 --> 08:13.586
We know what
you're going through.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.457
And we're here
if you need us.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.220
It's okay.
I'm okay. Really.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.925
I'll see you in class.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.119
She's so not okay.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.064
Yeah, not even close.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.778
(inhales sharply)

08:44.520 --> 08:46.385
What'd he say?
(gasps)

08:47.060 --> 08:48.015
Jesus!

08:48.020 --> 08:50.159
Are they gonna
arrest my dad?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.426
It's kinda
what sheriffs do.

08:53.430 --> 08:56.957
(sighs) my dad's
gonna hate me.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.822
You did the right thing.

09:00.300 --> 09:05.499
I can't imagine anything
feeling right ever again.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.109
(sighs)

09:14.280 --> 09:17.818
Intolerance. Deception.
Hysteria.

09:17.820 --> 09:21.779
These are all central
themes to
the cruCIb/e.

09:21.790 --> 09:22.814
See, hysteria causes...

09:22.820 --> 09:25.789
Look who's talking,
mr. Not branson.

09:25.790 --> 09:26.484
Listen to him.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.559
He's sending us a message,
because we know his secret.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.221
All we know is that
he changed his name.

09:30.230 --> 09:35.065
And he was conveniently
not_ around for the
bowling alley incident.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.059
Noah, audrey...

09:36.070 --> 09:38.538
Would either of you
like to discuss the parallels

09:38.540 --> 09:42.306
Between
the cruCIb/e
and mccarthyism?

09:45.310 --> 09:48.279
Well, i'm no fan of
mccarthy's blacklist,

09:48.280 --> 09:53.217
But sometimes the guy next
door is worshiping the devil.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.581
Like richard ramirez.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.549
Noah is right,
of course.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.028
There are exceptions
to the rule...

10:01.030 --> 10:05.524
However, the themes of trust
and tolerance still resonate.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.591
It's not what
it looks like.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.465
Really? Because it looks
like you're moving a body.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.607
And your daughter's
worried it's her mom.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.737
(chuckling)
i told brooke,
monica is fine.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.002
She's at
pleasant roads
rehab in phoenix.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.248
Give her a call.
I will.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.047
But we still have the issue
of four murdered kids

10:23.050 --> 10:27.384
Using that video to blackmail
you, including will belmont.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.517
I had nothing
to do with that.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.159
I've been trying
to protect this town.

10:34.530 --> 10:38.728
Quinn, piper shaw
is keeping this
private for now,

10:38.730 --> 10:39.719
But it's gonna come out.

10:39.740 --> 10:44.598
So, i suggest you tell
me what the hell
happened before it does.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.009
I will.

10:46.010 --> 10:49.173
But i want to tell
my daughter first.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.169
I owe her that.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.618
Brooke, your dad
wants to talk.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.975
Just help me out here.

10:57.990 --> 11:03.986
No, i won't do anything until
i know my mom is okay.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.418
Here's her number.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.952
She's expecting your call.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.568
(sighs)

11:22.240 --> 11:23.935
Hello?

11:25.580 --> 11:29.072
Mom? It's me...

11:29.480 --> 11:32.415
I know, i miss you, too.
(cries)

11:33.220 --> 11:36.383
No. I'm not okay...

11:54.980 --> 11:56.379
Hi.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.805
Thanks for not asking.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.075
You're welcome.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.808
I should've called you.

12:06.820 --> 12:07.639
I've just been, uh...

12:07.660 --> 12:10.549
Hey, you don't
have to explain.

12:15.630 --> 12:22.069
Hey. Look, i know things
were a little up-in-the-air
the day will...

12:23.110 --> 12:26.238
I just want you
to know that i'm here.

12:29.210 --> 12:30.438
Thanks. (sniffles)

12:30.450 --> 12:32.805
Um, i should go to work.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.467
(gasps)

13:04.980 --> 13:06.470
(panﬁng)

13:11.820 --> 13:12.912
So on top
of everything else,

13:12.920 --> 13:16.549
Now our mayor's
in my jail cell
pending charges.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.279
You really think quinn is
involved in all of this?

13:19.290 --> 13:20.257
In something, yes.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.320
My gut tells me
it's another distraction.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.719
Well, then,
follow your gut.

13:26.130 --> 13:28.325
Oh, i've also got
a location on your ex.

13:28.340 --> 13:32.265
He was working on an oil rig.
Then he took some time off.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.407
He's been gone
three weeks.

13:33.410 --> 13:36.868
Which is when the heart
arrived at your doorstep.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.733
We talked about this...

13:37.750 --> 13:39.206
Look, i didn't say
he was involved.

13:39.210 --> 13:42.247
Okay? I just,
i wanted you to know.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.443
How's emma?

13:44.450 --> 13:45.849
The doctor said
she's in shock,

13:45.850 --> 13:47.317
Let her work through it.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.811
I'm trying,
but it's terrifying.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.888
I know.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.426
We've brought
in more officers.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.227
And i'm working
with your cell provider

13:54.230 --> 13:58.223
And the _social media sites
that this guy was usmg
to contact her.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.595
Can you trace back
the messages?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.898
Not yet. But if he
tries to reach out again,

14:01.900 --> 14:04.061
We're gonna be there
to track him.

14:04.070 --> 14:04.934
Don't.
Emma!

14:04.940 --> 14:06.805
He'll know, and then
he'll punish me,

14:06.810 --> 14:08.505
_And someone else
I care about wrll die.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.636
I know you're
scared, all right.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.677
We've been doubling our
efforts to find this guy
and to keep you safe.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.840
That's what you
don't understand.

14:13.850 --> 14:16.614
It's not me that
i'm worried about.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.715
It's all of you.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.448
Did you see how branson
gave us that stink eye?

14:24.460 --> 14:27.156
Yeah, all charm one second,
then deadly the next.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.286
It's just like
in
the faculty

14:28.300 --> 14:30.359
Alien parasites turn
the high school teachers

14:30.370 --> 14:32.122
Into murderous
body snatchers.

14:32.130 --> 14:34.121
I hadn't actually
considered that possibility.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.596
Because you're not insane.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.498
It's wishful thinking.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.797
There are worse
ways to go

14:37.810 --> 14:39.869
Than being body-snatched
by famke janssen.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.871
(chuckles)

14:46.180 --> 14:47.909
Em?
(gasps)

14:48.780 --> 14:51.146
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.186
Uh, no, it's okay.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.881
Whatcha working on?

14:54.890 --> 14:56.414
Uh, just a research project.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.888
For the psych class
you don't have?

14:59.090 --> 14:59.988
I don't know
what you mean.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.651
Emma, are you
self-diagnosing
on the internet?

15:02.660 --> 15:03.228
Badidea.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.460
That always either leads
you to schizophrenia
or something terminal.

15:05.470 --> 15:09.395
You know what, guys,
it's not a big deal.
I'm just not sleeping.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.958
And seeing things?

15:10.970 --> 15:14.906
Emma, we're your friends.
You can talk to us.

15:18.110 --> 15:19.805
Ijust, um...

15:20.150 --> 15:22.516
I just keep replaying
what happened.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.809
You know, seeing
everything, seeing will.

15:26.820 --> 15:27.889
Honestly, i'm
not surprised.

15:27.890 --> 15:31.883
Seriously. Your brain needs
time to process the shock,

15:31.890 --> 15:33.255
To try to make
some sense of it.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.182
That's not paranoia.
It's survival.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.521
I'm not paranoid.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.418
No, i know.
That's what i was saying,

15:39.430 --> 15:42.536
That you are
the opposite of that.

15:42.870 --> 15:46.237
The internet is alarmist.
You are totally normal.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.101
I gotta go.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.674
You seriously need
an "off" switch.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.341
I know.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.018
(bell rings)

16:23.780 --> 16:25.099
(gasps)

16:32.520 --> 16:34.818
(panﬁng)
what do you want?

16:37.360 --> 16:39.225
I don't understand.

16:42.360 --> 16:42.928
(screams)

16:42.930 --> 16:46.627
Emma, it's me! It's me.
It's kieran!
(panUng)

16:46.630 --> 16:48.837
(bell rings)

16:57.850 --> 16:58.908
You might want to sit.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.377
You're making
your deputy nervous.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.644
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:05.390 --> 17:07.312
Should i ask what made
you so scared in there?

17:07.320 --> 17:08.878
No. You shouldn't.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.755
Okay.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.125
You feel
any better?

17:12.130 --> 17:13.119
Other than
constant fear,

17:13.130 --> 17:15.758
I don't really feel
much of anything.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.352
That's self-preservation.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.089
Well, it feels wrong.

17:22.870 --> 17:25.600
You know,
when my mom died,
i felt numb.

17:25.610 --> 17:28.568
I knew i was
supposed to cry.
But i couldn't.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.606
There's no right way
to feel about this.

17:31.610 --> 17:35.444
You just gotta do
whatever works for you.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.341
And i want to help.
No. You can't.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.114
He's still out there,
and he's looking
for his next target.

17:44.890 --> 17:47.029
I can't lose you, too.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.822
P/per:
The brutal murder
of wﬂl belmont

17:50.830 --> 17:53.697
Has forever changed
the town of lakewood.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.497
I came here
as an outs/der.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.004
And then will belmont
saved my life...

17:59.010 --> 18:01.399
So now i'm part of the story.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.800
I can't even pretend
to be objective anymore.

18:04.810 --> 18:07.108
Now, i just want
it to be over.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.547
And for the people
that i've come to know
to find peace again.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.852
Hey, stranger.
Welcome back.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.282
Thanks.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.383
Did you hear the news
about quinn maddox?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.049
Yeah. Yeah. I heard.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.051
You're unconvinced?

18:25.100 --> 18:25.919
(scoffs)

18:25.930 --> 18:27.420
I find it hard
to believe that, uh,

18:27.440 --> 18:31.365
The mayor was the one who
was chasing us around that
bowling alley.

18:32.510 --> 18:33.101
Oh.

18:33.110 --> 18:36.307
Don't... I got it.
It's okay. It's okay.
I want to help.

18:38.980 --> 18:43.144
Everyone wants to help,
but no one actually can. So...

18:49.260 --> 18:51.285
Emma, i know you're
going through hell,

18:51.290 --> 18:53.952
But you're going
to survive this.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.225
You know what, maybe
it's actually better
ifidont.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.197
Don't think that.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.690
He said that
it ends with me.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.191
So let's just skip
ahead to the ending.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.930
You can't let this
sadistic bastard win.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.237
If you're the key
to all of this,

19:06.240 --> 19:07.901
Then you have to find
a way to fight back.

19:07.910 --> 19:12.279
I did. And he sliced will in
half, right in front of me.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.673
(sighs) i don't know
if i have any fight left.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.946
Yes, you do. Because you come
from a family of survivors.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.056
Your mom, your dad,
and now you.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.584
Don't forget that.

19:26.590 --> 19:29.320
He said that my
family's a fraud.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.718
Do you believe him?

19:32.900 --> 19:33.821
I...

19:33.840 --> 19:36.889
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.901
Then you have
to trust your instincts.

19:38.910 --> 19:42.175
Go and find
the answers yourself.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.601
(sighs)

19:53.350 --> 19:56.114
y
Ill-

20:01.860 --> 20:04.055
Listen, i uh...

20:04.370 --> 20:07.726
When i told
you about kevin,
i wasn't, uh...

20:08.300 --> 20:09.790
I'm not accusing him.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.028
He's just one of
the only people

20:11.040 --> 20:13.235
Who knows your
connection to brandon.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.073
Kevin wouldn't hurt
emma like this.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.604
He wouldn't.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.345
What?

20:22.350 --> 20:24.648
I put a trace on his atm
and his credit cards.

20:24.650 --> 20:27.983
Got a hit at a gas
station near springfield
a few days ago.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.548
That's close.

20:30.730 --> 20:35.224
You'd tell me
if he contacted
you or emma, right?

20:35.230 --> 20:36.788
Of course.

20:46.270 --> 20:50.934
(music playing)
da/sy, da/sy,

20:50.950 --> 20:55.398
give me your answer, do

20:55.420 --> 20:58.719
i ’m half crazy

20:58.720 --> 21:02.986
all for the love of you

21:04.130 --> 21:07.224
(breath trembling)

21:29.350 --> 21:31.238
(screams)

21:37.830 --> 21:39.388
(shudders)

21:43.600 --> 21:45.124
Cop: Miss duval?

21:45.870 --> 21:48.088
(panﬁng)

22:01.650 --> 22:03.277
Doctor: She's exhausted.
She needs some rest.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.748
Let's_make sure _
she's monitored overnight.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.342
Nurse: Yes, doctor.

22:09.890 --> 22:12.279
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.279
Yeah, i'm fine.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.191
I'm sorry that
i scared you guys.

22:18.770 --> 22:19.725
I love you.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.631
I'll see you first thing
in the morning, okay?

22:41.020 --> 22:43.682
(knocking at door)
(panﬁng)

22:49.300 --> 22:50.289
(door closes)

22:50.300 --> 22:53.667
Kevin: Emma? Honey, it's me.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.307
Dad?

23:06.250 --> 23:08.400
Emma: How did you know
how to find me?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.478
The sheriff
called my boss.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.675
I came as soon as i heard
what was happening.

23:11.690 --> 23:12.816
I'm so sorry.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.378
You're
sorry?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.919
Have you
talked to mom?

23:16.920 --> 23:17.818
Not yet.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.980
I wasn't sure she'd
let me see you.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.391
In your last letter, you
said you were doing good.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.624
My last letter out of the
dozens that you've ignored?

23:28.270 --> 23:30.659
I wanted to answer
them, emma. I did.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.035
But the way your mom
and i left things,

23:32.040 --> 23:34.565
It seemed better
for everyone to have
a clean break.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.174
Better for everyone
or better for you?

23:39.280 --> 23:41.202
Did you even miss me?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.308
Every day.

23:43.550 --> 23:46.383
But after what your mom
and i went through,

23:46.390 --> 23:48.346
I couldn't stay.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.159
The person
who's doing this,

23:56.160 --> 23:58.594
The person who
killed my friends,

23:58.600 --> 24:02.366
Led me to the tape of
your session with dr. Pell.

24:02.840 --> 24:03.795
After brandon james...

24:03.810 --> 24:05.835
I'm sorry you had
to hear that.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.674
Look, i had
to sort myself out.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.271
And did you?

24:10.280 --> 24:13.147
I admit it's
taken me a while.

24:13.750 --> 24:14.739
But i'm here now.

24:14.750 --> 24:19.380
No. No, you don't get
to come back after
all this time

24:19.390 --> 24:20.243
And be the hero.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.651
Emma...
No. I don't
want you here, okay?

24:23.660 --> 24:25.184
Please leave.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.480
Just go!

24:55.320 --> 24:56.912
Piper: Knock-knock.

24:58.790 --> 24:59.620
I heard what happened.

24:59.630 --> 25:03.350
And you wanted to come see
how
girl, interrupted
i am?

25:03.930 --> 25:04.749
(stutters) i'm...

25:04.770 --> 25:08.422
I'm not here for a story.
I'm just here as a friend.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.698
Sorry to intrude.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.201
My dad came
back last night.

25:17.410 --> 25:20.607
After walking out
eight years ago.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.639
(stutters)
oh, wow. That's...

25:24.490 --> 25:26.913
That's huge.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.615
What'd you say?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.884
I told him to leave.

25:35.800 --> 25:40.669
I, uh, know that i said that
i would respect your privacy

25:40.670 --> 25:42.319
But can i offer
you some advnce

25:42.340 --> 25:46.401
From someone_ whose dad
IS never coming back?

25:49.610 --> 25:54.149
Second chances are rare.
Don't waste them.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.016
(sighs)

26:00.020 --> 26:01.044
So, if branson is the killer,

26:01.060 --> 26:04.689
Why would he take a job at
a school instead of somewhere
below the radar?

26:04.690 --> 26:05.588
Hiding in plain sight.

26:05.590 --> 26:08.889
Think about it.
His classroom is one-stop
victim shopping.

26:08.900 --> 26:13.269
Pick one, slay one,
console one, then repeat.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.363
Okay, what's his criteria?

26:15.370 --> 26:16.098
Archetypes?

26:16.100 --> 26:17.499
You know, 'cause nina
was the queen bee,

26:17.510 --> 26:21.037
Tyler, the rebel.
Riley was the brain.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.372
And now will, the jock.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.708
If he is killing off
the members of
the breakfast club,

26:27.720 --> 26:31.269
The only one left is
the raccoon-eyed weird girl
who only wears black.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.689
Or the weird
girl's girlfriend,

26:32.690 --> 26:36.217
Which might make
sense with rachel.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.159
Okay, maybe not.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.048
But if branson's thrill
is hiding in plain sight

26:39.060 --> 26:40.186
And the classroom
IS hIS cover,

26:40.190 --> 26:43.648
Then it stands to reason
that he'd want his tools
of the trade handy.

26:43.660 --> 26:48.324
Well, he was awfully
anxious when he found
us In there alone.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.696
Maybe it's time to dig
a little deeper.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.404
(door opens)

27:00.550 --> 27:01.903
Hi.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.548
Hey, hey, sweetheart.

27:05.550 --> 27:07.939
Oh, god, i've been
so worried about you.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.813
I spoke to mom.

27:08.820 --> 27:11.152
See, i told you.
I told you
she was okay.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.585
Yeah, well, i'm finding it
a little hard to trust you
these days.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.123
I know.

27:16.130 --> 27:21.067
I know, but everything
i have done has been
to protect our family.

27:21.070 --> 27:21.991
Even murder?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.333
Absolutely not!
I swear to you.

27:25.340 --> 27:28.605
Then who was in
that trunk, dad?

27:33.180 --> 27:36.911
Your mother s_tarted
usrng again.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.084
And she found herself
a new friend to help her.

27:41.090 --> 27:45.379
I found him od'd
in the guest room.

27:45.390 --> 27:46.880
No pulse. No id.

27:46.890 --> 27:49.154
(stammers)
and i panicked.
God.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.388
Why not call for help?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.389
Because our secrets...

27:51.400 --> 27:53.129
Your mom's secrets
would've gotten out

27:53.130 --> 27:55.394
And that would
have destroyed her.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.095
Her? Or you?

27:57.610 --> 28:00.909
We are a family, brooke.

28:01.110 --> 28:04.876
If one of us gets hurt,
we all get hurt.

28:05.080 --> 28:05.978
Yeah.

28:05.980 --> 28:09.347
And i'm left
to pick up the pieces.

28:09.350 --> 28:11.739
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

28:11.750 --> 28:15.345
But we are going
to survive this.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.158
You'll stay with
the fitzgeralds for now.

28:18.160 --> 28:24.258
Just be strong until
we can all be back
together again.

28:27.230 --> 28:29.437
Maybe we shouldn't.

28:30.740 --> 28:31.866
Brooke.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.201
Brooke, wait...

28:33.210 --> 28:34.666
Goodbye, daddy.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.776
Brooke. Brooke, please!

28:38.780 --> 28:40.372
(scoffs)

28:50.460 --> 28:52.849
(breathing heavily)

28:59.800 --> 29:02.166
(kevin yelling indistinctly)

29:02.170 --> 29:02.966
This is a nightmare.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.062
Maggie:
You need to calm down.

29:04.070 --> 29:05.230
Kevin: Don't tell me
to calm down.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.639
Maggie: Kevin, please,
you're going to wake emma.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.201
Kevin: That's what
you're worried about?
Waking emma?

29:11.650 --> 29:15.347
Kevin: Maybe she should.
We can't keep
lying to her.

29:15.350 --> 29:17.375
Maggie: She's just a child.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.608
Kevin: How could
you keep that from me?

29:18.620 --> 29:20.588
Maggie: Having the baby
was my decision.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.046
You should have
told me about this!

29:22.060 --> 29:25.211
Why? Would you
have wanted it?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.523
No. It was my choice.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.589
Kevin: You made that
choice way before that.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.919
Maggie: We both
made that choice.

29:30.930 --> 29:34.024
I can't do this.
I can't.

29:34.030 --> 29:37.158
Then go.
We'll be fine
on our own.

29:37.370 --> 29:39.361
(cries)

29:39.810 --> 29:42.028
Goodbye, maggie.

29:44.780 --> 29:48.409
No! Dad, hey, wait!

29:48.620 --> 29:49.769
I remember now.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.475
The fight that you
had the night you left.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.617
It was because you
didn't want me.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.110
What? No, emma.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.918
No. I wasn't
talking about you.

29:58.190 --> 30:01.489
Then who?
I don't understand.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.095
Look around.
You know the truth.

30:05.670 --> 30:06.819
What...

30:06.830 --> 30:08.366
Think about it.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.239
(indistinct chatter)

30:25.820 --> 30:27.344
Why are we here?

30:30.120 --> 30:33.829
Oh, my god.
He wasn't real.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.594
Oh, my god.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.289
A baby.

31:57.580 --> 31:58.899
What are we trying to find?

31:58.910 --> 32:00.468
I don't know, but with
the malware gone,

32:00.480 --> 32:04.211
We need something more before
we can call the sheriff.

32:05.220 --> 32:07.882
Hey, i think there's
something up there.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.982
(grunts)

32:18.570 --> 32:21.391
Holy dexter's
air conditioner...

32:21.400 --> 32:24.130
You think that's...
The murder knife.

32:24.670 --> 32:25.637
Yeah.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.029
Hey, the last time
we tampered with evidence,

32:28.040 --> 32:30.577
Emma's virgin
video went viral.

32:32.210 --> 32:33.700
(beeping)

32:37.050 --> 32:40.645
We just got a hit on
mr. Branson's real identity.

32:40.850 --> 32:43.057
Now we call the sheriff.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.652
Seth branson used
to be seth palmer.

32:49.660 --> 32:54.097
Back in 2013, he was
teaching in this small liberal
arts college in new hampshire,

32:54.100 --> 32:58.469
When he had this affair
with this gorgeous
18-year-old girl.

32:58.470 --> 33:01.030
Slightly ick,
but not illegal.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.270
But then she turned up dead.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.643
Palmer was a suspect
until he disappeared.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.868
And became our mr. Branson.

33:09.420 --> 33:14.141
So, why were the two
of you looking into him
in the first place?

33:14.150 --> 33:14.787
Seriously?

33:14.790 --> 33:18.783
There's a bloody knife in
a bag but you're concerned
about how we found...

33:19.230 --> 33:22.825
Wait, do you think
we planted this?

33:23.160 --> 33:25.924
I just asked
a simple question.

33:26.230 --> 33:30.064
We found evidence
that he was cyber-spying
on the whole town,

33:30.070 --> 33:32.459
Or at least helping
nina and tyler do it.

33:32.470 --> 33:33.767
What evidence?
Malware,

33:33.770 --> 33:35.567
Attached to his online
homework site.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.979
I think riley found out
about it

33:36.980 --> 33:38.572
And then he killed her
to keep her quiet.

33:38.580 --> 33:42.004
And then he went
and erased every trace of it.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.169
And he was "out of town"

33:43.180 --> 33:47.241
During the whole
bowling alley thing
and when will got killed.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.584
(suspenseful music playing)

34:00.300 --> 34:04.134
Mike, this is hud. Put out
an apb on seth branson.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.700
Well, that's seth palmer.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.062
I'll shut up.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.199
Mr. Branson: Brooke.

34:16.450 --> 34:18.042
I'm glad you called.

34:23.860 --> 34:27.819
(cries)
oh, hey, hey, hey.

34:28.230 --> 34:29.549
It's okay.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.529
You always made
me feel that way.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.028
I would've
texted you sooner,

34:35.040 --> 34:38.635
But i was just finishing up
rehearsal with the drama club.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.674
I heard about your dad.
I'm so sorry.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.240
I'm tired of talking.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.006
Brooke...

34:49.020 --> 34:51.978
Brooke.
Is your rehearsal over?

34:52.690 --> 34:55.284
Brooke, you are
not thinking straight.

34:55.290 --> 34:56.587
I don't want to think.

34:56.590 --> 35:01.482
I just want to forget
everything for
a little while.

35:10.170 --> 35:15.665
Hey, i came as fast
as i could, what is it?

35:15.910 --> 35:19.209
Mom, whose
ultrasound is this?

35:22.750 --> 35:23.819
Where did you get that?

35:23.820 --> 35:26.448
Whose ultrasound is this?

35:28.390 --> 35:31.951
Somebody murdered will
right in front of me.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.224
And this might be why.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.564
I didn't leave town
because of the press,

35:47.570 --> 35:49.765
Or because i was sick.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.969
It's because you
were pregnant.

35:55.180 --> 35:59.310
I had the baby
and gave it up
for adoption.

35:59.320 --> 36:04.417
I was 16.
My parents made
all the arrangements.

36:04.890 --> 36:08.121
It was a closed adoption.
They kept me out of it.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.627
I didn't even know
if it was a boy or a girl.

36:13.830 --> 36:16.765
We moved back to lakewood,
into a new house.

36:16.770 --> 36:21.867
I got back into school,
and i reconnected
with your dad.

36:22.810 --> 36:27.838
And i tried really hard
to make a new life.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.477
But he wasn't the father.

36:33.490 --> 36:37.551
Remember i told you
that your dad and i
were having problems?

36:38.030 --> 36:40.123
Our group was at
the bowling alley
one night.

36:40.130 --> 36:45.022
And i found out that
he slept with one of
my best friends.

36:45.030 --> 36:49.364
And brandon james
worked at that
bowling alley.

36:50.170 --> 36:54.800
He heard me crying outside
and he drove me home.

36:56.210 --> 37:01.443
I was so hurt and angry.
And he was so kind...

37:03.880 --> 37:05.711
It just happened.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.814
I didn't mean
to lie to you.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.887
(sobs) i just had so many
regrets about so many things.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.629
Mom, come here.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.489
I hope you can understand.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.292
Mom,

37:26.310 --> 37:28.107
Of course i can.

37:29.910 --> 37:32.879
But the killer wanted
me to find this.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.401
So somebody knows.

37:36.150 --> 37:41.178
What if the child that
you gave up is back?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.007
Are you sure about this?

38:03.010 --> 38:06.639
This is the only thing that
feels right in my life today.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.116
(moans softly)

38:13.320 --> 38:14.981
(both breathing heavily)

38:16.790 --> 38:18.678
(soft thudding)

38:18.890 --> 38:21.279
Did you hear something?
What?

38:22.660 --> 38:24.594
Stay right here.

38:25.130 --> 38:27.098
I'll go check it out.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.214
Seth?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.082
This isn't funny...

38:53.830 --> 38:55.183
Seth?

39:06.070 --> 39:09.665
Love the colors,
but the spot's too much.

39:14.210 --> 39:15.575
Seth?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.952
Oh, my god!

39:28.860 --> 39:30.657
(screams)

39:31.300 --> 39:33.723
(panﬁng)

39:42.880 --> 39:44.700
Oh, my god.
What happened?

39:44.710 --> 39:45.608
(sobbing)
where were you?

39:45.610 --> 39:48.170
I got locked out.
I had to walk around.

39:49.650 --> 39:52.539
Seth branson!
Don't move!

39:52.750 --> 39:53.614
Let go of the girl.

39:53.620 --> 39:54.746
No, she wa...
She was attacked!

39:54.760 --> 39:56.580
(stutters) he's gotta
still be here somewhere!

39:56.590 --> 39:58.217
Yeah. Right in front of me.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.016
Take him in.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.322
Seth: Brooke! Brooke!

40:14.140 --> 40:16.734
(theme music playing)
