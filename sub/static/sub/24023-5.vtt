WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.505
Previously on Harrow...

00:02.640 --> 00:03.885
It's a serial number.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.885
We can look this up and find
out exactly who this guy is.

00:06.920 --> 00:09.715
I'm going to find this orthopaedic
surgeon before you do.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.040
Why do you get like this?

00:13.473 --> 00:15.265
Why do you freak out?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.565
Stephanie Quinn? 14 days to pay.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.965
This is not my debt.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.045
What would you do to protect your child?

00:23.280 --> 00:27.040
I thought you were smart
and you knew things.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.205
The police are coming.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.685
I know what they're looking for.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.005
I'll make back the money.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.565
I've got to go see Billie.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.645
You're going to spot me
$1,000 worth of E.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.298
I'm going to sell it

00:41.760 --> 00:44.000
and then we don't need to speak again.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:13.280 --> 01:15.245
Hey, devil girl. I heard you're helpful.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.960
I'm very helpful.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.805
You have five new messages.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.165
Received at 1:05am.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.200
Xantia, why don't you
answer the fucking phone?

01:36.149 --> 01:37.646
Hell must be nice.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.040
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.605
Xantia, I keep trying to call you.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.085
Where the hell are you?. Call me.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.440
<i>Received at 12:47.</i>

02:02.041 --> 02:03.724
It's about time.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.765
Sorry. I got your messages.

02:05.801 --> 02:07.006
I've just finished up.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.407
I've got to drop something off

02:08.443 --> 02:09.568
and then I'll come see you, OK?

02:09.604 --> 02:10.929
Alright, alright. Hurry.

02:12.401 --> 02:13.920
Fuck.

02:48.514 --> 02:49.954
Xant.

04:09.936 --> 04:10.936
Drive.

04:25.844 --> 04:27.769
Hi.
-Hi.

04:27.923 --> 04:30.603
What's up?
-You are. Got a pen?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.045
Coffee. Thanks, Harrow.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.645
Where's my car, Linds?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.280
What car?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.668
Fern.

04:52.704 --> 04:54.320
You didn't hear that from me.

04:55.034 --> 04:57.120
OK. Here you go, Linds.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.005
Just breathe in.
-I'm really scared.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.205
Just step back please, ma'am.
-Just give us a second, OK?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.379
Just step back.

05:12.415 --> 05:15.205
Harrow? I believe
you know Detective McCloud

05:15.240 --> 05:16.796
from Drugs and Serious Crime.

05:16.832 --> 05:17.872
Jill.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.618
Dan.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.445
So I'm guessing Drug Squad means

05:23.480 --> 05:26.125
that this young lady's fall
was a bit complicated.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.205
There was apparently a
party on the eighth floor.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.285
Everyone who could has flown the coop.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.485
We've got one young woman in emergency

05:32.520 --> 05:34.285
suffering the following symptoms,

05:34.320 --> 05:36.245
high heart rate, dehydration,

05:36.280 --> 05:37.826
bad hallucinations.

05:37.862 --> 05:39.827
None of them seem to know
exactly what they took.

05:39.863 --> 05:42.805
They thought it was some kind
of MDMA, but tablets, not tabs.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.846
The problem is

05:43.881 --> 05:46.725
the young woman in hospital
has a heart condition

05:46.760 --> 05:49.000
and her doctors need to
know exactly what she took.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.286
Well, how long has she been dead?

05:51.321 --> 05:53.245
Um, an hour nearly. Why?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.893
Have you taken your photos?
-Yeah.

05:55.929 --> 05:57.409
Get me the doctor on the phone.

05:58.028 --> 05:59.793
After death,

06:00.012 --> 06:02.325
the gastric lining can
begin to break down.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.600
Doctor Sharma, I have Daniel Harrow.

06:04.636 --> 06:05.802
Dan.

06:05.838 --> 06:08.125
Pete. I will bring your
ladder back, I promise.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.126
What have you got?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.885
Female, early twenties,

06:10.920 --> 06:13.525
with polymorphic VT.
-Sustained tachycardia?

06:13.560 --> 06:16.365
In bursts, but those bursts
are getting really high.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.685
I'm worried that her heart will fail

06:17.720 --> 06:19.805
but I don't dare give her anything
until I know what she's taken.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.005
So I'm guessing the best way to save her

06:22.040 --> 06:24.481
would be to find some
unmetabolised traces.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.680
Exactly.
-I'll call you back.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.856
Who are you calling?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.325
Deputy Coroner.
-What for?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.525
Permission. I need to cut her open.

06:37.393 --> 06:38.949
Damn. Straight to voicemail.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.492
I say just do it.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.615
Wait, wait. What? No.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.445
No, you do not have an
order for a post-mortem.

06:47.481 --> 06:48.806
You heard what Sharma said.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.647
There's a young girl in hospital, dying.

06:50.683 --> 06:52.363
Jesus Christ.
-Here.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.084
What's her name?
-Grace.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.405
Grace Mulgrew.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.920
She's a political law student.

07:06.506 --> 07:08.151
OK, Grace.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.200
Let's see if we can find what you took.

07:14.108 --> 07:16.353
Anything?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.240
Nothing much, but we'll
take it to the hospital.

07:20.146 --> 07:21.226
I'll need a lift.

07:22.265 --> 07:25.025
Maybe she didn't die.
-She fell eight storeys.

07:29.303 --> 07:31.303
_

07:32.490 --> 07:35.250
Can you tell me what's happening?
-I don't know what's happening.

07:36.219 --> 07:38.304
This just says there's
people in hospital

07:38.340 --> 07:40.305
with suspected drug overdoses.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.920
Fuck.

08:04.932 --> 08:06.858
Dan.
-Pete.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.565
Nothing useful in that stomach content?

08:09.600 --> 08:10.726
I'm afraid not.

08:10.761 --> 08:12.165
Thanks for trying, though.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.805
Torsades?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.147
It's in and out. It's
not getting any better.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.074
Cardiologist is on her way, but...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.205
Do you think she's suffering
from long QT syndrome?

08:22.240 --> 08:25.765
Could be the cause of her
rapid heartbeat, but...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.005
Long QT's pretty rare.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
Yeah, and there are
like 12 different types.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.401
13.

08:30.437 --> 08:31.757
But it's worth a look.

08:33.539 --> 08:34.580
Harrow.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.046
Nichols.

08:38.081 --> 08:40.405
Since when did you and
Pavich start hooking up?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.919
None of your bloody business. Come here.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.085
Drug Squad's been looking

08:48.120 --> 08:49.845
into the social media
uploads from that party,

08:49.880 --> 08:51.725
trying to work out who might
have taken those pills,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.805
or who sold them.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.320
There's a photo taken outside
that you need to see.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.000
Is that your car?

09:08.680 --> 09:11.580
Same model. Can't see the plates.

09:12.442 --> 09:14.335
You know I wasn't at that party.

09:15.201 --> 09:17.886
I know your daughter has
a tendency to borrow stuff,

09:18.120 --> 09:20.445
and I also know that she
was admitted to hospital

09:20.480 --> 09:22.000
not that long ago for an overdose.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.206
It's not Fern's kind of scene.

09:24.241 --> 09:25.442
Yeah, I know.

09:25.478 --> 09:27.203
But if she was at that party,

09:27.239 --> 09:29.079
with all that bad gear
floating around...

09:30.660 --> 09:33.580
I'm just saying, look in on her, OK?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.805
And if you do speak to her,
ask if she saw who was selling.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.285
'Cause once we find out who it is,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.120
we're gonna charge that
prick with murder.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.360
Are you alright?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.055
Mum said she wouldn't
give you my number.

10:05.091 --> 10:07.615
You were at that party, weren't you?

10:07.651 --> 10:10.096
Yeah.
-Fern.

10:10.132 --> 10:11.534
How do you know?

10:12.161 --> 10:15.726
The police have a photo of my
car out the front of the party.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.600
You didn't take what was
going around, did you?

10:20.218 --> 10:23.350
No.
-Are you sure you're alright?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.880
She's in your morgue, isn't she?

10:27.698 --> 10:28.898
Did you see what happened?

10:30.688 --> 10:32.048
What are people saying?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.205
There are some people in intensive care

10:36.240 --> 10:37.685
and there's a girl who, I don't know,

10:37.720 --> 10:39.760
she might die because they just
don't know what she took.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.460
Can I...

10:43.560 --> 10:46.080
Can I please see you,
make sure you're OK?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.380
I'm OK.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.285
I told you this was a bad idea.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.610
We've gotta go see Billie.
-You're kidding, right?

11:03.646 --> 11:04.732
And say what?

11:04.768 --> 11:06.765
The pills he gave are killing people.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.910
He needs to hand them in.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.720
Hand yours in.
-I would, but I just flushed them.

11:15.061 --> 11:17.981
We can't just go see Billie
and accuse him like that.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.965
Just promise me you won't go, please.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.565
He's dangerous.

11:28.193 --> 11:31.638
Hello?
-Hi. It's Jesse.

11:31.674 --> 11:33.154
From school?

11:34.438 --> 11:36.563
I know who you are, Jesse from school.

11:36.599 --> 11:37.725
Good.

11:37.761 --> 11:40.685
I just wanted to see if you would
like that lift this morning

11:40.721 --> 11:42.566
to said school.

11:42.602 --> 11:46.282
Well, normally, but I just
got my car back from...

11:48.080 --> 11:49.760
Shit.

11:50.964 --> 11:52.151
Steph?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.480
Can I call you back?

11:57.497 --> 12:00.222
Proceeding to right leg.

12:00.258 --> 12:04.143
Examination reveals fresh contusion
on anterior of right knee

12:04.179 --> 12:07.784
approximately 3cm by 2cm.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.340
Whatcha doing?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.560
W-what are you...? Please, leave.
-_

12:15.153 --> 12:16.518
Well, that's amazing.

12:16.554 --> 12:18.034
I'm trying to work here.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.364
_

12:19.400 --> 12:21.725
Just pause, will you? Pause.
-_

12:22.857 --> 12:25.457
You... Just get him
out of here, will you?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.640
Is your morning lacking
sufficient chaos?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.680
Another overdose from the party?
-No.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.967
Her name is Xantia Couttas,
a legal secretary.

12:37.003 --> 12:39.768
Her body was found in a
pond in the city parklands.

12:39.804 --> 12:42.009
Someone hit her on the head with a rock

12:42.045 --> 12:43.245
and then drowned her.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.610
Sexual assault? Robbery?
-Neither.

12:48.176 --> 12:49.396
What?

12:50.363 --> 12:52.143
Well, she didn't drown.

12:52.722 --> 12:54.606
Her throat's too swollen.

13:04.289 --> 13:05.289
Hang on.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.160
Soil.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.568
Someone choked her to
death with garden soil.

13:20.454 --> 13:21.734
Billie.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.920
Billie.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.280
Billie?

13:49.460 --> 13:50.425
Billie?

13:50.560 --> 13:51.526
Billie.

13:51.561 --> 13:53.365
Shit, Billie.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.560
Billie?

14:07.560 --> 14:08.526
Ambulance.

14:08.561 --> 14:11.080
Drug overdose, 142 Penrose
Street, Auchenflower.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.540
Billie?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.885
It's open.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.400
Ambulance.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.299
Hello?

14:53.221 --> 14:54.621
Sergeant Dass?

14:56.680 --> 14:58.960
You authorised that street autopsy.

15:00.034 --> 15:01.564
Is that what Harrow said?
-No.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.594
He said he thought you'd say no
so he went right ahead and did it.

15:04.682 --> 15:07.885
But I know you, I know
you miss Melbourne CIB,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.325
I know you miss being a detective.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.385
But you're Scenes of Crime now.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.886
Yes, sir.

15:12.921 --> 15:15.731
And make a point of
apologising to Maxine Pavich.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.560
Sure.

15:18.266 --> 15:20.911
"Interfering with a corpse."

15:20.947 --> 15:22.525
That's the charge the lawyer

15:22.560 --> 15:24.685
engaged by the girl's
mother is throwing around.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.165
This coffee is dreadful.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.880
When were you in Geneva?
-None of your business.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.765
Deputy Coroner's not impressed.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.085
If the stomach contents
had produced something,

15:35.120 --> 15:36.320
it might have made your...

15:37.320 --> 15:40.765
.."cavalier sidewalk
surgery" easier to spin,

15:40.800 --> 15:42.365
but it didn't.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.845
Cavalier.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.925
So, when can I finish her post-mortem?

15:45.960 --> 15:47.565
The DC wants an explanation

15:47.600 --> 15:50.205
as to why you didn't wait
for his return call.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.565
Then tell him that the
parietal cells undergo lysis,

15:54.600 --> 15:58.965
releasing excess hydrochloric acid
that quickly destroys gastric mucosa

15:59.000 --> 16:02.405
and the dissociating admixture
can leak into the stomach cavity...

16:02.440 --> 16:04.645
Daniel.
-meaning that if there was

16:04.680 --> 16:06.085
any remnants of a pill,

16:06.120 --> 16:07.645
I needed to find it fast.
-Daniel.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.165
So, with a girl still dying in hospital,

16:09.200 --> 16:10.645
I thought it was worth
cutting open a dead one

16:10.680 --> 16:12.360
to try and save her.
-Daniel.

16:13.177 --> 16:15.542
I understand. I do.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.245
And for what it's worth, I
think you did the right thing.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.485
So let me finish Grace
Mulgrew's post-mortem.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.445
No. No-one's going near
her body, not right now.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.805
Why not?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.125
Because her parents are coming in later

16:27.160 --> 16:30.965
to formally identify her and,
depending on their reaction,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.925
we will decide whether
it's you or Fairley

16:32.960 --> 16:35.365
who completes the PM
you started on the street.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.445
What are the river bones
still doing here?

16:37.480 --> 16:39.245
Well, it's an open case.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.965
Well, can't they go in
the bone archive room?

16:41.000 --> 16:41.966
It's full.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.045
What about cold storage?
-That's full too.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.292
What...

16:45.328 --> 16:46.960
What do you suggest?

16:49.070 --> 16:50.486
Well, I don't know.

16:50.521 --> 16:53.845
I mean, it's not like we
can exactly cremate them.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.245
Why not? You've got the DNA samples?

16:56.280 --> 16:57.326
Yeah.
-You scanned them?

16:57.361 --> 16:59.325
Yeah, but...
-You retrieved some ortho plate?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.925
Well, been no luck with that either.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.720
Is there anything else
you need from them?

17:03.778 --> 17:05.303
I... I mean...

17:05.339 --> 17:06.425
Good.

17:06.461 --> 17:08.204
I'll put in a request
to have them destroyed.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.480
Have Simon get rid of them.

17:18.226 --> 17:19.631
Grace Mulgrew.

17:19.698 --> 17:21.183
The girl who fell from the building.

17:21.219 --> 17:23.059
Daniel, you can't be here.

17:28.474 --> 17:29.561
Hey.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.823
Hi. Has she arrived?

17:31.859 --> 17:34.405
Yeah, but I'm not allowed
anywhere near her at the moment.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.645
Well, I guess we screwed up.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.165
We tried. That's not screwing up.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.525
You still at the scene?
-Yeah.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.405
I've got like 20 million plastic
cups to fingerprint and swab

17:45.440 --> 17:47.880
and, four used condoms.

17:49.122 --> 17:50.487
Hey, no trace of the drug?

17:50.553 --> 17:52.884
That girl in hospital is going downhill.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.125
No, not yet. Nichols found a
bunch of photos from the party.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.125
Witnesses aren't talking.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.765
Young lawyers taking
drugs at a death scene.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.445
They're hardly going to
incriminate themselves.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.325
They think the seller was a young woman.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.120
Red dress. There's no
clear photos of her yet.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.153
Hello.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.645
Your friend Detective McCloud is fun.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.125
How come you two didn't hit it off?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.640
I guess she's just too easygoing for me.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.215
Booties and gloves, detectives.

18:20.287 --> 18:22.285
Yeah, I just came to see
how the printing was going.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.125
If I know Jill, she'll be all
over this case in no time.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.280
Is that Harrow?

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
Dan.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.388
Jill.

18:33.921 --> 18:36.485
Nichols says your daughter Fern
may have been at the party.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.924
She says she wasn't.

18:38.986 --> 18:40.391
I'd like to talk to her.

18:40.489 --> 18:41.689
I don't have her number.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.535
Then how did you speak to her?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.874
She called me on a landline.

18:48.740 --> 18:49.900
Alright.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.980
Was your daughter here?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.394
Hey, look, I'm going to
have to call you back, OK?

18:59.430 --> 19:00.790
OK.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.560
Bub, where are you?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.160
Stay there.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.445
You're bleeding.
-It's not mine.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.777
Stop, OK?

19:24.261 --> 19:25.743
Why here?

19:26.222 --> 19:27.941
No cameras.

19:42.356 --> 19:44.356
Were you wearing a red dress?

19:49.298 --> 19:51.258
Baby, they're looking for you.

19:52.194 --> 19:53.674
Just save that girl.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.725
Hi, you've called Stephanie Tolson.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.123
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.604
Hey, it's me.

20:27.785 --> 20:30.390
If the cops call asking
for Fern's number,

20:30.426 --> 20:32.186
don't give it to them.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.729
I'll get these to the lab.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.845
I don't want to know.

20:38.199 --> 20:39.599
I bet they do.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.062
Anonymous.

20:43.098 --> 20:45.663
It was left out the
back of Turbot Street.

20:45.699 --> 20:47.264
Why the morgue?

20:47.300 --> 20:50.345
Well, I guess the person heard
a girl fell from a building.

20:50.381 --> 20:52.946
Dead people go to the morgue.
Seems smart to me.

20:52.982 --> 20:56.102
Fingerprints on the bag?
-Shit. I'm sorry.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.285
Have you spoken to your daughter?

21:00.320 --> 21:03.285
Like I said, I don't have Fern's number.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.925
Your ex-wife doesn't
have her number either.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.278
It's inconvenient.

21:06.314 --> 21:08.312
Jill, Harrow's daughter's
a bit of a wild card.

21:08.348 --> 21:10.565
A wild card who's been
admitted for a drug overdose,

21:10.600 --> 21:12.325
who sleeps rough and whose
father's car, it seems,

21:12.360 --> 21:13.800
was parked outside the party.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.920
Is this your daughter, Dan?

21:21.360 --> 21:23.302
It doesn't seem like
the Fern that I know.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.472
Have you got a recent photo of her?

21:27.235 --> 21:30.227
Fern hasn't been much
for photos recently.

21:31.219 --> 21:32.379
Alright.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.470
Let's go see him.

21:35.650 --> 21:36.850
See who?

21:48.203 --> 21:51.208
Billie Radbourne. One
prior for possession.

21:51.423 --> 21:53.383
Same symptoms.
-Same drug.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.895
Was he at the party?

21:56.018 --> 21:57.943
Well, he hasn't appeared
on any of the social uploads.

21:57.979 --> 21:59.544
The ambos brought him from his house.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.706
They got his phone.

22:00.742 --> 22:02.826
OK, great. When it's cracked,
I want to see recent calls.

22:02.862 --> 22:04.022
Who phoned the ambos?

22:04.993 --> 22:06.638
Anonymous 000.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.806
A young woman. No ID.

22:15.813 --> 22:17.293
Babe, your dad's calling again.

22:18.469 --> 22:20.074
Come on, Fish.

22:20.264 --> 22:22.024
You didn't know what was in those pills.

22:42.145 --> 22:43.390
What the hell is going on?

22:43.426 --> 22:44.906
Why do the police want Fern?

22:46.585 --> 22:48.790
Well, she took my car without asking.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.271
I reported it stolen.

22:50.307 --> 22:53.427
So why was the cop that called
me from the Drug Squad?

22:54.825 --> 22:57.705
I don't care if you lie to
me, just not about Fern.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.685
Did you hear about the girl that
fell from a building last night?

23:04.720 --> 23:07.160
Bad trip form a party drug.

23:08.777 --> 23:11.737
The cops think that the
seller was a young woman.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.085
It wasn't Fern's kind of scene.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.285
It was full of rich, young
lawyers in D&G and Paul Smith.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.965
Yeah, that's where she should be.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.086
It's a misunderstanding.

23:21.121 --> 23:23.400
I'm just trying to keep
her out of trouble.

23:29.516 --> 23:30.676
What do we do?

23:32.290 --> 23:34.330
She won't answer calls. I don't know.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.600
If you talk to her, just tell her
to lay low until all this blows over.

23:42.473 --> 23:45.073
If she's got your car,
how did you get here?

23:45.915 --> 23:47.081
Borrowed Fairley's.

23:47.117 --> 23:48.750
Lyle lent you his car?

23:50.600 --> 23:53.565
Deep down, he's a really nice guy.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.805
Whoever stole it, I want them
strung up by their thumbs

23:55.840 --> 23:57.200
and beaten like a pinata.

23:57.933 --> 23:59.013
Thank you, Constable.

24:00.288 --> 24:01.568
Breathe.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.880
Jessica, tell me when my
taxi arrives, will you?

24:08.961 --> 24:11.126
Soroya. Hi.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.240
Hi.
-Who's that?

24:14.360 --> 24:17.005
The young girl that fell from
the balcony and her parents.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.925
Yes. The one Harrow
cut open on the street.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.565
Well, no wonder they're upset.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.445
What would you have done?

24:23.480 --> 24:25.035
Waited for the coroner.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.925
I mean, look who's unhappy, everyone.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.645
We have a process.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.720
It is meticulous. It's a
bit slow, but it works.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.845
You know, Harrow and I went to
the same school for a while.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.165
Straight As for both of us,

24:38.200 --> 24:39.900
until he dropped out.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.660
Why did he drop out?

24:41.696 --> 24:43.381
Family stuff.

24:43.417 --> 24:47.302
Harrow is a fabulous pathologist
but he's like a painter.

24:47.338 --> 24:51.583
Like a Greco or a Hebuterne or Van Gogh.

24:51.619 --> 24:54.144
Just all wild stabs in bright colours.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.460
No meticulous staying
in the lines for him.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.015
All those painters killed themselves.

25:00.051 --> 25:02.056
I don't think he'll do that.

25:02.092 --> 25:04.657
I wouldn't want to be around him
when he self-destructs, though.

25:04.693 --> 25:06.178
Are you warning me off him?

25:06.214 --> 25:07.699
I'm just warning.

25:07.735 --> 25:08.735
Cheerio.

25:09.860 --> 25:10.860
Bye.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.965
Hey, Peter.
-Hi, Dan. Sorry.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.450
Mad day. Listen, thank you.

25:22.593 --> 25:24.445
You were right about
Hannah's rapid heartbeat.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.085
It was long QT syndrome.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.565
And what about the pills?
How did your lab go?

25:28.600 --> 25:30.685
They're some kind of mash-up.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.360
Mostly a substituted
phenethylamine hallucinogen.

25:33.547 --> 25:34.992
Like N-Bomb?

25:35.028 --> 25:38.365
Yeah, but these have traces of fentanyl.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.485
Fentanyl and N-Bomb? That's
like petrol and matches.

25:42.521 --> 25:45.005
And in Hannah's case, it triggered
a severe drop in her potassium,

25:45.040 --> 25:46.605
which caused her heart
to beat erratically.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.885
So what did the cardiologist
do? IV magnesium?

25:49.920 --> 25:51.845
We tried magnesium but no response,

25:51.880 --> 25:54.405
so we had to go with overdrive pacing

25:54.440 --> 25:56.000
and she's responding well.

25:56.804 --> 26:00.324
Looks like she's out of the
woods. Anyway, thank you.

26:01.219 --> 26:02.219
OK.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.485
The person you have
called is not available.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.245
Please leave...

26:12.280 --> 26:13.760
Are you worried about her?

26:16.920 --> 26:20.125
The girl in the hospital? I
heard she was going to be OK.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.808
Yeah. I was just on with Peter Sharma.

26:22.931 --> 26:24.251
Come in.

26:29.330 --> 26:32.575
I was just making some
dinner. Would you like some?

26:32.753 --> 26:34.558
If you've got enough.

26:34.594 --> 26:38.234
Well, I've got enough spaghetti.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.460
Great.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.005
A lot can be said about a man
by the size of his boat.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.260
It's not just the size.

26:49.838 --> 26:52.663
Is this your daughter?
-Fern, yeah.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.805
Is she like you?

26:54.840 --> 26:57.365
She's like no-one.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.902
Strong, wilful, straight As in school.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.346
But dropped out?
-Yeah.

27:04.698 --> 27:06.298
<i>So she is like you.</i>

27:09.440 --> 27:11.040
You've been talking to Fairley.

27:16.826 --> 27:18.386
I want to know about you.

27:20.180 --> 27:24.020
School Captain, cello,
the debating team.

27:25.740 --> 27:30.145
Head Prefect, flute,
and the Science Club.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.645
Making me the go-to girl for
fake IDs and cigarettes and boys.

27:35.681 --> 27:37.340
A rule breaker.

27:38.578 --> 27:43.367
So why Scenes of Crime?
What brought you up here?

27:43.750 --> 27:45.640
Why'd you drop out of school?

27:48.011 --> 27:51.616
My father died. He was a doctor.

27:51.652 --> 27:53.137
A real doctor.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.605
And that's what you
wanted to do. Save lives.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.845
We do what we're good at.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.045
You did good today.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.680
You saved that girl.

28:02.691 --> 28:04.791
Whoever brought in those pills did that.

28:08.165 --> 28:09.490
Do you mind?

28:09.720 --> 28:11.200
No, please.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.480
Fairley thinks you're trouble.

28:27.756 --> 28:29.716
Fairley's a smart man.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.480
Cigarettes, fake IDs and boys.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.160
I'm trouble too.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.400
I like trouble.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.094
Jill, Billie Radbourne's phone.

29:29.618 --> 29:31.223
He calls this number a lot.

29:31.259 --> 29:33.619
Well, if he's using,
that's his dealer. Call it.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.765
The person you have
called is unavailable...

29:37.800 --> 29:39.400
Who's it registered to?

29:41.160 --> 29:43.040
Ivanka Trump.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.286
A burner, OK.

29:45.321 --> 29:49.018
So this one's his mother's
phone, local Thai takeaway.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.193
So who's this?

29:51.687 --> 29:55.527
OK, who is Callan Prowd?
Can we track his number?

30:09.120 --> 30:11.245
You left your phone, Callan.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.041
I'm looking for Callan...

30:13.560 --> 30:16.240
Fern. Fern Harrow.

30:16.787 --> 30:18.307
We've been looking for you.

30:46.363 --> 30:48.331
_

31:08.153 --> 31:09.193
Hey.

31:11.265 --> 31:13.390
My God, you miss him too.
-What?

31:13.426 --> 31:14.871
George Michael.
-No.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.987
I just... It's a long story.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.525
What's up?
-Did Pavich tell you?

31:20.560 --> 31:22.325
She's authorised to have
the river bones cremated.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.805
Dammit.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.205
Are they going now?
-Yeah.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.565
Yeah. It feels weird.
-How do you mean?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.485
I mean, we still don't know who he is.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.605
This is the first time
I think we've ever,

31:32.640 --> 31:34.645
you know, failed.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.445
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.005
Look, I'll be in soon.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.525
We need to talk about George Michael.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.125
We really don't.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.286
Hey.

31:56.321 --> 31:57.885
Hi.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.600
I had a good time last night.
-Me too.

32:02.078 --> 32:03.758
Heard about the river bones?

32:04.331 --> 32:06.136
Yeah.

32:06.204 --> 32:08.729
Pavich said that you
fought to keep them.

32:08.769 --> 32:10.606
But that's not why I'm calling.

32:10.642 --> 32:14.242
Dan, Jill McCloud has
detained your daughter.

32:18.672 --> 32:20.917
What the hell is going on, Bryan?

32:20.960 --> 32:23.805
The girl in the hospital
with the heart condition.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.605
She just ID'd Fern as the
person who sold her the pills.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.646
From what?

32:27.681 --> 32:29.805
From a blurred photo of the
back of someone's head?

32:29.840 --> 32:33.758
That could be Angela Merkel.
-Harrow. I saw your car outside.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.125
You miraculously turn up
with some of those pills.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.840
Your daughter fits the description.

32:39.120 --> 32:43.600
I know you love her, mate,
but don't play me for a fool.

32:46.954 --> 32:48.074
I want to talk to her.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.605
I'm going to get you a lawyer.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.405
And you don't have to talk to the police

33:06.440 --> 33:07.960
until your lawyer arrives, OK?

33:24.914 --> 33:26.194
So, what happened?

33:28.920 --> 33:33.840
They say they found Callan's
number on some drug user's phone.

33:35.066 --> 33:41.586
And that... I was selling drugs
at some party two nights ago.

33:45.267 --> 33:47.632
Did you tell them where
you were that night?

33:48.080 --> 33:52.200
Callan already told
them that I was with him.

33:57.440 --> 34:01.285
I saw on the news
that there was some girl

34:01.320 --> 34:02.920
who was in hospital.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.645
Yes.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.440
She, had a heart
problem, but she's OK now.

34:10.552 --> 34:15.677
In fact, she's the one that's
saying that you were selling pills.

34:15.713 --> 34:17.838
I mean, how would you
even get hold of drugs?

34:17.873 --> 34:19.119
Exactly.

34:19.155 --> 34:22.715
I don't know. You'd have
to ask some drug user.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.520
Is there anyone else sick in hospital?

34:31.616 --> 34:33.136
He wasn't at the party.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.199
So I don't know how
that's going to help you.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.840
I don't either.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.039
I'll get you out of here, OK?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.280
Don't tell Mum.

35:15.745 --> 35:19.030
Boss?
-I'm not here.

35:19.066 --> 35:21.191
I can hear you, though.

35:21.227 --> 35:22.847
Not if you go away, you can't.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.800
I heard.

35:33.602 --> 35:35.602
They haven't charged
her, though, have they?

35:37.880 --> 35:39.160
And what are you going to do?

35:41.220 --> 35:44.473
I don't know. If I knew...

35:45.400 --> 35:47.485
I'd do anything for her.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.446
That's for me.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.480
Sorry, I've been using your
computer while you've been...

35:53.541 --> 35:55.181
Yep.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.685
Analytics on Xantia Couttas,

35:58.720 --> 36:01.023
Fairley's choking victim from the pond.

36:01.059 --> 36:03.464
Was that the soil
analysis from her throat?

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
Yeah.

36:06.963 --> 36:08.888
It's even messier than the pond water.

36:08.924 --> 36:10.124
Go back.

36:11.965 --> 36:13.325
Stop.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.560
Methoxybenzyl.

36:19.337 --> 36:20.337
So?

36:23.080 --> 36:26.685
Demethylated metabolites
are excreted by a body

36:26.720 --> 36:29.125
that's taken a synthesis
of methoxy-benzaldehyde.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.005
That's the drug that Grace Mulgrew,

36:32.040 --> 36:33.925
the girl who fell
from the balcony, took.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.325
And also the drug the girl
with the heart condition took.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.283
So why was there traces
of it in Xantia's throat?

36:39.319 --> 36:41.844
Was there any in her other toxes?

36:41.880 --> 36:43.965
Nope. Only the soil.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.295
Let me see that soil analysis again.

36:46.851 --> 36:51.131
Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium.

36:52.281 --> 36:53.480
Salts.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.726
Salts found in human sweat.

36:56.762 --> 37:00.003
And what can synthesised
hallucinogens make you do?

37:00.159 --> 37:02.164
Sweat. A lot.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.725
Fairley thinks she died around the
same time the party was going on.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.799
But nowhere near the party.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.285
And what was that you said
you found on her hands?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.005
Um...

37:12.040 --> 37:14.880
Naphtha, propane and silicone.

37:15.819 --> 37:19.356
Like silicone aerosol spray?
-Yeah, maybe.

37:24.035 --> 37:26.360
She was dressed to go out.

37:26.396 --> 37:30.081
Why on earth would she
have industrial lubricant

37:30.440 --> 37:32.440
on perfectly manicured hands?

37:34.506 --> 37:35.986
Care to go for a drive?

37:37.018 --> 37:39.578
I'll be back. I just want
to double-check the exits.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.560
This is it.
-And the soil from here?

38:32.211 --> 38:33.821
She lived right there.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.920
That's where the police think
she was coming from, anyway.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.520
Did they find any silicone
spray in her apartment?

38:42.880 --> 38:43.880
Nope.

38:54.561 --> 38:58.041
<i>What if she was headed
towards her apartment?</i>

38:59.601 --> 39:00.921
Say, from there?

39:25.019 --> 39:26.235
Silicone.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.952
Hi.

39:30.988 --> 39:32.353
Hi.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.605
I just found an interesting fingerprint

39:34.640 --> 39:36.160
here at the party building.

39:36.897 --> 39:38.185
Interesting how?

39:39.320 --> 39:40.725
Interesting because...

39:40.760 --> 39:42.520
..she's in your morgue.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.685
We lubricate the hinges
and locks every month.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.520
No-one's ever complained.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.640
Well, there you go.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.525
Looks like a pharmacy.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.320
Powders.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.965
Smart. Don't keep incriminating
evidence at home.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.480
The Red Rabbits.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.645
Here.
-That could be our mystery number.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.200
What was the number on
Billie Radbourne's phone?

40:35.040 --> 40:36.560
I want this phone unlocked.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.525
So you found her prints at the party.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.205
She threw away a plastic
glass while she was leaving.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.165
So she's come back here to her locker,

40:46.200 --> 40:49.725
she's put drugs back,
she's put money back.

40:49.760 --> 40:53.485
She locks the door, she gets
silicone lubricant on her hands.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.805
She's heading back
towards her apartment.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.040
Not realising that
someone's waiting for her.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.365
She's struck on the head.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.725
He drags her into the shadows where
she's too dazed to do anything,

41:09.760 --> 41:11.565
while he scoops up the soil.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.605
This guy's sweating, and
the sweat from his hands

41:15.640 --> 41:17.365
is getting into that soil.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.685
And he's sweating so much

41:18.720 --> 41:21.525
because he's taken a Red
Rabbit hallucinogen too.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.245
But...
-Ambulance.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.205
he makes it home.
-It's open.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.125
And that's where the
paramedics find him.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.400
Detective?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.760
We have a voicemail.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.045
Xant, you bitch.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.125
Those things you sold me,
these red fucking things,

41:38.160 --> 41:39.680
they're bad, bitch.

41:41.120 --> 41:44.485
I'm going to fuckin' kill you.
I'm going to kill you.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.925
Call the hospital. I want
Billie Radbourne detained.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.280
Shit.

42:28.418 --> 42:30.663
His medical condition...

42:30.699 --> 42:32.264
Sir?

42:32.680 --> 42:35.480
Hey. Hey. Billie.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.600
Billie.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
Billie.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.045
Billie. Stop.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.725
Wait.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.120
Here to see my daughter, Fern Harrow.
-Fern Harrow.

43:07.792 --> 43:09.312
She's just been released.

43:52.974 --> 43:57.339
Hey. Have you heard from her?
-No, but I think she'll be OK.

43:57.375 --> 43:59.420
And that drug business?

43:59.456 --> 44:02.856
Well, like I said, just
a big misunderstanding.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.403
Speaking of Fern, do you know
where her old sleeping bag is?

44:10.171 --> 44:12.856
No. Why?

44:12.947 --> 44:16.672
I was just thinking about...
going on a... camping trip.

44:16.802 --> 44:18.402
With your teacher friend?

44:19.971 --> 44:21.336
Maybe.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.520
Why don't you check in the
junk box in the shed?

44:25.970 --> 44:27.215
Yep.

44:27.520 --> 44:31.040
Thank you.
-OK. 'Night.

44:39.817 --> 44:45.257
Well, I guess I better go.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.965
You never answered my question.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.925
About why you came up here.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.360
Another time.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.320
What's that?

45:29.720 --> 45:31.165
Another time.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.160
My car.

46:05.760 --> 46:10.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop.
Stop. Excuse me, friend.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.325
It's a no standing zone, friend.
-Yes, but I didn't park it here.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.805
Is this your vehicle?
-Yes, but it's been stolen.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.245
There... there's been a mistake.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.485
Yep, a $350 mistake.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.765
What...?

46:27.938 --> 46:30.781
_

46:39.525 --> 46:42.850
You look nice.
-The Deputy Coroner rang.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.285
The parents of the girl
who fell from the building

46:45.320 --> 46:47.285
have agreed to a post-mortem.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.925
But Mbanefo has expressly suggested

46:49.960 --> 46:52.440
that you not be the one to perform it.

46:54.938 --> 46:56.583
But...

46:56.705 --> 47:01.030
I know that you like to
finish what you start, so...

47:01.066 --> 47:02.280
scoot.

47:05.363 --> 47:07.968
Do you know why they
didn't want it done?

47:08.075 --> 47:11.080
They weren't ready to
accept they'd lost her.

47:11.116 --> 47:14.956
Because when we start,
it makes it real, somehow.

47:17.232 --> 47:18.592
Go look after her.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.325
Don't you ever do that again.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.725
I'll fill her up the next time.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.725
The girl from the pond.

47:33.760 --> 47:37.200
<i>My autopsy? My autopsy.</i>

47:44.641 --> 47:48.006
She just thought she was
going to have a fun night.

47:48.049 --> 47:49.809
Until someone sold her a pill.

47:54.421 --> 47:55.901
I saw Fern the other day.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.520
Out the back.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.759
Was she at that party?

48:04.602 --> 48:05.602
Harrow?

48:10.595 --> 48:12.155
No.

48:28.800 --> 48:29.926
Soroya Dass.

48:29.961 --> 48:32.645
It's Lyle. Fairley. From Turbot Street.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.405
Hi, Lyle.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.085
Now, this is a bit unusual,

48:36.120 --> 48:37.965
but remember how Harrow had a view

48:38.000 --> 48:40.680
as to how long those bones
had been in the river?

48:41.347 --> 48:43.992
Worms, right?
-Yes. It's just that...

48:44.028 --> 48:47.313
well, I'm not reading the
text the same way he did.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.200
You know, I'm not saying
Harrow's wrong, but...

48:53.120 --> 48:54.086
But?

48:54.121 --> 48:57.325
I think that those bones
might have been in the river

48:57.360 --> 48:58.645
for less than a year.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.880
Nine months.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.521
They've gone to the crematorium, Lyle.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.618
OK. Well...

49:07.120 --> 49:09.525
Well, I just thought that...

49:09.560 --> 49:14.120
you should know that
Harrow is not perfect.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.360
OK. Thanks, Lyle.
-Very good.

50:10.873 --> 50:13.005
_

50:26.000 --> 50:27.885
Next on Harrow...

50:27.920 --> 50:29.925
I want to see if I can
postpone the cremation

50:29.960 --> 50:32.005
of some remains that were sent to you.

50:32.040 --> 50:33.685
Tell me, was it you who
went behind my back?

50:33.720 --> 50:35.200
Is there something I need to know?

50:36.800 --> 50:38.165
I know you want a place of our own.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.845
My stepmum said it's ours if we want it.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.365
Hell.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.365
She lost a lot of blood,
so where did she lose it?

50:44.400 --> 50:46.445
I don't know. But it wasn't here.

50:46.480 --> 50:48.720
Sometimes a bloke gets away with murder.

50:49.920 --> 50:51.280
Did you kill him?

50:52.305 --> 50:58.706
