00:34.881 --> 00:36.474
Easy, now.

00:36.314 --> 00:38.322
Easy, boys.

00:41.884 --> 00:43.826
Easy, now.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.710
What the hell?

00:53.982 --> 00:56.252
Code red. Code red. We got a sit...

01:16.710 --> 01:18.849
Sir, we have a breach
in the perimeter.

01:23.271 --> 01:25.606
Go secure. Sweep the hard drives.
Lock us down.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.354
Heat signatures everywhere.
They've covered all the halls.

01:57.521 --> 01:59.310
Then I guess we better
clear the halls.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.221
Go!

02:40.125 --> 02:42.100
Evacuate! Now!

02:52.481 --> 02:55.678
Come on. I dare you to come walking
through that door. Come get some.

02:56.545 --> 02:58.040
Keys.

02:58.914 --> 03:01.435
- Who the hell did we piss off this time?
- Get in.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.926
- This thing armed?
- Always.

03:05.092 --> 03:06.619
Good man.

03:25.226 --> 03:27.081
You ever seen one of these?

03:28.138 --> 03:29.383
Only in my dreams.

03:29.547 --> 03:33.126
Geothermal micro cam,
Aquacade uplinks, 480 gigs.

03:33.292 --> 03:36.195
Sir, this thing is 10 generations
beyond the NSA.

03:36.364 --> 03:38.569
So whoever attacked us
is loaded for war.

03:39.405 --> 03:41.293
And they knew
exactly where to hit us.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.015
We gotta go off the grid now.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.933
Not another skater,
snowboarder or biker.

03:46.096 --> 03:48.398
The new XXX has gotta be
more dangerous.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.349
Deadlier. More attitude.

03:50.512 --> 03:52.040
More attitude?

03:54.162 --> 03:56.301
Where the hell
are we gonna find that?

05:28.204 --> 05:30.114
You have a meeting
with the EPA at noon...

05:30.285 --> 05:31.943
...to discuss...
- A tree is a tree.

05:32.109 --> 05:33.517
How many more can they look at?

05:33.678 --> 05:35.566
Your anniversary, roses or tulips?

05:35.727 --> 05:39.044
George. Tulips, yellow. Thank you.

05:39.216 --> 05:41.256
An NSA chapter was just hit.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.400
Sixteen agents, all dead.

05:43.568 --> 05:45.456
Sixteen of our men?

05:45.617 --> 05:48.040
On our own soil?
How the hell did this happen?

05:48.210 --> 05:49.967
I'm looking into it.

05:50.131 --> 05:53.132
- Suspects?
- Too many.

05:53.556 --> 05:55.564
How concerned do I need to be?

05:55.732 --> 05:58.865
I'll take care of it.
Quick and clean. And contained.

06:00.309 --> 06:02.896
Goddamn it, 16 men?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.557
How many more have to die?

06:05.752 --> 06:07.279
This is no longer a budget meeting.

06:07.448 --> 06:09.783
The secretary of defense
has just informed me...

06:09.945 --> 06:13.109
...that 16 of our NSA agents
were killed.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.452
In Virginia.

06:14.617 --> 06:18.579
This is a laundry list of suspects
that covers half the world.

06:20.123 --> 06:22.491
It's time for a new direction.

06:22.652 --> 06:26.482
The new military bill
is critical to that direction.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.582
So it's going in my State of the Union
address this week.

06:44.098 --> 06:46.816
Some privacy, please.
Attorney-client privilege.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.846
Good to see you again, lieutenant.

07:02.952 --> 07:04.959
How long has it been? Nine years?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.268
Not long enough.

07:07.432 --> 07:09.124
And don't call me "lieutenant."

07:09.289 --> 07:11.777
I'm inmate 3655 now.

07:13.226 --> 07:15.430
What you doing here, Gibbons?
What you want?

07:15.595 --> 07:18.279
You. I wanna give you a job.

07:18.443 --> 07:20.451
And why would
I do a damn thing for you?

07:22.573 --> 07:24.646
You ever see lions at the zoo?

07:25.422 --> 07:28.008
You can always tell the ones
that were captured in the wild...

07:28.175 --> 07:29.899
By the look in their eyes.

07:30.063 --> 07:34.439
Jesus Christ. You still coming
with that same sorry-ass speech?

07:34.608 --> 07:36.496
Does it ever actually work?

07:37.137 --> 07:40.236
- From time to time, yeah.
- Not this time.

07:40.402 --> 07:43.632
I'm not feeling too patriotic
these days.

07:43.795 --> 07:45.618
So I want no part of your little war.

07:45.779 --> 07:47.787
You're already part of it.

07:47.956 --> 07:50.771
Somebody's taken out
members of our old unit.

07:50.933 --> 07:54.195
They came for me.
They will come for you.

07:54.646 --> 07:59.284
Now, you can die in here,
or you can take the fight to them.

07:59.447 --> 08:02.415
The Darius I remember always
liked to throw the first punch.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.568
New speech, huh?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.890
You get any exercise in here?

08:17.053 --> 08:18.995
Twelve to 1 every day on the yard.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.206
12:06 tomorrow.

08:21.373 --> 08:24.374
- Bravo Delta High Sign.
- High Sign?

08:24.575 --> 08:27.871
High Sign. Be just like old times.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.815
You better hope not.

08:30.976 --> 08:33.628
Because last time out didn't have
such a happy ending.

08:33.793 --> 08:36.095
You went MIA,
and I ended up in here.

08:36.258 --> 08:38.047
Okay, wrap it up.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.705
Hey.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.130
I like what you did with your face.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.729
Come on, let's go.

08:52.871 --> 08:54.497
There's been a report
from home office.

08:54.663 --> 08:57.413
Xander Cage was killed
in Bora Bora last night.

08:57.576 --> 08:59.169
Bora Bora?

08:59.336 --> 09:01.890
Why don't I get
those assignments, huh?

09:02.505 --> 09:04.448
What about Gibbons?
Any word on Gibbons?

09:04.617 --> 09:06.920
Unaccounted for. We do know this:

09:07.083 --> 09:10.345
He was one of only three men
with access to that elevator.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.752
The other two...

09:11.916 --> 09:14.186
Ain't gonna be giving us
much of a statement.

09:14.669 --> 09:18.980
All right, put Mr. Gibbons on the wire.
Full recon. Wrap it tight.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.925
<i>A-Block to exercise yard.</i>

09:23.087 --> 09:24.997
<i>A-Block to exercise yard.</i>

09:28.849 --> 09:31.151
Time to take the dog out for a walk.

09:46.421 --> 09:48.080
You know...

09:48.598 --> 09:50.355
...l'm gonna really miss you boys.
- What?

10:00.121 --> 10:02.937
- Secure all doors!
- Prisoner, stand down!

10:03.675 --> 10:06.872
- Level six, lockdown!
- Get backup up here!

10:07.324 --> 10:08.698
Prisoner, stand down!

10:13.117 --> 10:14.394
Get him!

10:18.527 --> 10:20.153
- Laundry! West door!
- Marco!

10:52.809 --> 10:54.402
Got him.
Two hundred and fifty yards.

10:54.569 --> 10:57.057
Where's he gonna go?
He's nowhere near the wall.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.738
All right, man!

11:30.995 --> 11:31.944
- Get him!
- Hold it!

11:32.116 --> 11:33.742
Come back!

11:59.899 --> 12:01.558
You were late.

12:02.652 --> 12:05.141
You sure know
how to pick them, sir.

12:07.677 --> 12:08.987
Who the hell is this guy?

12:09.150 --> 12:10.743
Civilian contractor.

12:10.910 --> 12:13.758
By the time he wakes up,
we'll be long gone.

12:20.129 --> 12:23.294
- You said 12:06.
- Hit some turbulence.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.306
- We got large and extra large.
- Who are you, the butler?

12:26.467 --> 12:28.191
Toby Lee Shavers,
D.C. Tech Division.

12:28.355 --> 12:30.778
- Yeah. Darius Stone, cellblock A.
- Not anymore.

12:30.948 --> 12:32.956
Darius Stone no longer exists.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.198
- Well, who the hell am I?
- You're the new XXX.

12:35.366 --> 12:36.708
Sound like a porno star.

12:36.870 --> 12:39.009
- What happened to the old XXX?
- He's dead.

12:39.174 --> 12:42.885
XXX is the designation we give to
deep-cover agents with special skills.

12:43.048 --> 12:45.121
Yeah, whatever. First things first.

12:45.288 --> 12:47.329
I've been on the inside a long time.

12:47.497 --> 12:50.215
I need what every man needs
when he's coming off of lockdown.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.786
You know what I'm saying?

12:55.211 --> 12:57.895
Yeah, baby. Who's your daddy?

13:03.789 --> 13:05.317
You sure we got the right guy?

13:05.486 --> 13:08.105
Hey, buddy,
more fries and another shake.

13:08.271 --> 13:09.930
You got it.

13:10.447 --> 13:15.238
- We need to go to work now.
- I need more fries and another shake.

13:15.409 --> 13:17.897
Hey, you work for us now.

13:18.066 --> 13:20.368
- So you're gonna do...
- What I want when I want.

13:21.459 --> 13:23.499
Look...

13:23.667 --> 13:27.662
...by my count, you boys just broke
about 10 federal laws back there.

13:27.829 --> 13:30.285
Aiding and abetting,
harboring a fugitive...

13:30.454 --> 13:32.843
...and my personal favorite,
grand-theft chopper.

13:34.262 --> 13:36.401
- So, what's your point?
- That you two...

13:36.567 --> 13:41.871
...are looking at three strikes
and the inside of a very small cell.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.172
- You know that's my speech.
- I'm running the show now.

13:45.337 --> 13:47.727
So here's the deal:
I don't answer to you...

13:47.898 --> 13:50.265
...and I damn sure don't answer
to college boy.

13:50.426 --> 13:52.118
College boy?

13:53.115 --> 13:54.643
Done.

13:56.477 --> 13:57.939
Pay the man.

13:58.109 --> 14:02.038
Okay. So we know you can fight
and eat, but what else can you do?

14:02.206 --> 14:05.785
The last XXX, he could ski, surf,
do all kinds of stunts.

14:05.951 --> 14:07.610
Well, he's dead now, isn't he?

14:07.776 --> 14:09.751
So things are gonna be
different around here.

14:09.921 --> 14:11.415
Because I don't play with my life.

14:11.585 --> 14:15.164
- I'd rather play with yours.
- We gotta get back to D.C.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.469
We need a place to lay low.

14:18.723 --> 14:21.441
I know the safest place in town.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.241
This is the safest place in town?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.569
Stay put. I'll handle this.

15:25.493 --> 15:28.494
D-Train Stone.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.446
Heard they had you locked down
in the deepest hole...

15:31.607 --> 15:33.102
...this side of the Grand Canyon.

15:33.272 --> 15:36.307
Yeah, they let me out early
for bad behavior.

15:36.473 --> 15:39.507
- Man, it's been a while, D.
- Where's the boss? I need to talk.

15:39.674 --> 15:42.904
Man, a lot's been changing
since you left, D.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.824
I run the chop shop now.

15:46.171 --> 15:49.336
- Where's Lo?
- Uptown.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.410
Uptown?

15:54.782 --> 15:56.954
Now, this is more like it.

15:57.119 --> 15:58.494
Welcome to the west side, X.

15:58.655 --> 16:01.503
You wanna run in these circles,
you're gonna have to blend.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.192
I don't blend.

16:09.251 --> 16:12.929
The Dino has the torque curve
dropping off around 6400 rpm.

16:13.092 --> 16:16.737
Dial down the injector pulse width
by about 10 percent.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.105
Try 20.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.663
Darius.

16:26.759 --> 16:28.036
You look older.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.590
Nine years of bad food
will do that to you.

16:31.081 --> 16:32.674
Nine years.

16:33.705 --> 16:37.635
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that a few years shy of 20?

16:38.155 --> 16:40.872
Just tell me what you need
so we can do this and be done.

16:41.035 --> 16:43.687
That is why you're here, right?
You need something.

16:43.852 --> 16:46.154
Hot shower, place to crash.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.266
Look around, Darius.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.989
I've got a good life here.

16:55.151 --> 16:58.413
And I'm not gonna let you
wreck it this time.

16:59.216 --> 17:00.973
So...

17:02.641 --> 17:04.813
...what's in it for me?

17:05.810 --> 17:07.469
'67 GTO.

17:07.634 --> 17:11.497
Thousand horsepower, crate motor,
trick suspension.

17:11.667 --> 17:12.944
- What?
- He's right.

17:13.973 --> 17:16.590
- They'll be looking for it.
- Besides, if we're gonna roll...

17:16.757 --> 17:19.954
...we're gonna need something
with a little more muscle.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.131
Something nasty.

17:22.903 --> 17:24.976
I can do nasty.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.737
I know you can.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.674
Bored and stroked,
full roller, 8 liters.

17:30.841 --> 17:35.217
Supercharged with a 25-psi boost,
automated hydraulics...

17:35.386 --> 17:38.584
...high-stall converter with shift kit.
That gonna do the trick?

17:38.748 --> 17:40.690
- You happy?
- I'm good.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.454
I love this girl.

17:52.479 --> 17:55.579
All right, the target is information.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.975
It's on a hard drive
inside my old headquarters, here.

17:59.522 --> 18:01.049
The rest of it is at my house.

18:01.218 --> 18:03.422
- I'll pick that up tonight while you...
- Information?

18:03.586 --> 18:05.147
Well, start by giving me some.

18:05.892 --> 18:08.860
- We on the same page?
- You know what I'm talking about.

18:09.028 --> 18:11.582
Last time out, I went down,
and you disappeared.

18:11.749 --> 18:14.685
Look, you aren't the only one
who lost something that day.

18:15.430 --> 18:17.732
When the fire started,
you were busy with the general.

18:17.894 --> 18:20.929
Some of us went in
to see who we could save.

18:21.096 --> 18:24.741
Now, you think this looks bad? You
should've seen it before I got it fixed.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.412
Guess nobody's story
has a happy ending.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.370
Story's not over yet, soldier.

18:39.693 --> 18:41.100
Shavers...

18:41.261 --> 18:44.077
...can you make that
into a personal weapon?

18:45.007 --> 18:46.917
Give me an hour.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.535
- We straight?
- It's funny, captain.

18:51.696 --> 18:54.763
Wars come and go,
but my soldiers stay eternal.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.809
I like that. Who said it?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.207
- Jefferson? Patton?
- Tupac.

19:13.911 --> 19:15.766
All right, X, this is a covert op.

19:15.927 --> 19:17.521
Full stealth, total silence.

19:18.808 --> 19:20.597
You're gonna wanna be
real delicate here.

19:26.811 --> 19:28.240
Subtle.

19:30.523 --> 19:32.214
Very subtle.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.908
This is sector 14.

19:34.076 --> 19:36.248
We got an attack, topside.

19:36.733 --> 19:40.443
You two, hold the floor.
Everybody else, follow me.

19:46.304 --> 19:48.760
All right, X, you got three minutes.

19:56.707 --> 20:01.148
X, Gibbons' office is
northwest corner, sector four.

20:05.861 --> 20:07.356
Hey! Wait!

20:13.064 --> 20:14.177
X, main room.

20:14.344 --> 20:16.711
<i>Remove the first of three drives
facing you.</i>

20:23.371 --> 20:24.615
There's nobody here.

20:24.779 --> 20:26.306
Yeah, except for all of us.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.825
It wasn't an attack,
it was a diversion.

20:30.541 --> 20:34.022
All right, X, they're coming
back down. You gotta go. Now.

20:59.445 --> 21:00.754
Lock this place down.

21:00.917 --> 21:02.478
I want him in hand, alive.

21:02.646 --> 21:04.981
<i>College boy, I'm cut off.
Get me out of here.</i>

21:05.142 --> 21:07.761
Okay, X. Boat dock,
quarter mile, dead ahead.

21:11.576 --> 21:13.006
I want that truck.

21:13.176 --> 21:16.144
Block every road
in a 10-mile radius.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.762
Everybody okay?

22:22.924 --> 22:25.380
Blows up my car,
he blows up my boats.

22:25.709 --> 22:27.532
Who the hell is this guy?

22:33.199 --> 22:35.339
All right, college boy,
I'm headed upstream.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.923
X, got a little bit of a problem here.

22:39.089 --> 22:40.682
<i>This is the police.</i>

22:40.849 --> 22:43.184
Goddamn!
All you had to do was drive.

22:43.346 --> 22:46.064
You know what, X?
I'm really starting to miss the old XXX.

22:46.258 --> 22:48.430
Stop your vehicle now.

22:48.595 --> 22:50.538
Okay, I see you.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.346
Hey, get your ass
out the driver's seat.

23:41.731 --> 23:43.586
Mission accomplished.

23:47.076 --> 23:52.479
Darius Stone. Born south side, D.C.
Mother died young, father raised him.

23:52.646 --> 23:54.304
Not much to report till '88.

23:54.470 --> 23:58.148
His dad was killed by a stray bullet
in a 211, and Darius went off the grid.

23:58.599 --> 24:00.771
Started with graffiti,
reckless driving.

24:00.936 --> 24:04.199
Quickly worked his way up to
grand-theft auto and resisting arrest.

24:04.361 --> 24:07.144
Took him some time
to find his calling in the Navy.

24:07.306 --> 24:09.129
Specifically, the Navy SEALs.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.936
Trained sniper, top scores.
Urban recon, demolition.

24:13.099 --> 24:16.995
The highest dive in Navy history,
250 feet.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.395
Augustus Gibbons recruited him
into an elite unit, Level 5 Classified.

24:20.558 --> 24:23.657
Ran ops in Eastern Europe
till Christmas in Kosovo.

24:24.462 --> 24:27.562
Their general ordered them
to set a fire to clear civilians...

24:27.728 --> 24:30.795
...but Stone refused. Led a mutiny
against a four-star general...

24:30.961 --> 24:33.417
...the current secretary of defense,
George Deckert...

24:33.585 --> 24:35.725
...who had him court-martialed
for a 20-year term.

24:35.890 --> 24:37.800
Ten for disobeying direct orders...

24:37.970 --> 24:40.459
...and another 10 for breaking
the general's jaw.

24:41.107 --> 24:42.799
This is the last footage
we have on him.

24:42.964 --> 24:45.812
A meeting with his lawyer,
Jonathan Edward Cochran.

24:45.973 --> 24:47.534
Oh, that's cute.

24:48.021 --> 24:50.062
Johnnie Cochran.

24:50.742 --> 24:53.590
I don't think Mr. Stone can afford
Johnnie's fee. Do we have audio?

24:53.751 --> 24:55.377
It's attorney-client. No mikes.

24:55.543 --> 24:57.486
Hold it there. Okay, reel it back.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.344
Back, back, back. Freeze it.

25:00.825 --> 25:02.003
Blow it up.

25:04.314 --> 25:06.900
Gibbons and Stone
on a comeback tour.

25:07.995 --> 25:10.898
All right, listen up. I want all eyes
up and running on these two.

25:11.068 --> 25:13.457
And I want hard 20s
on the rest of their old unit.

25:13.629 --> 25:15.036
I wanna know where they are...

25:15.198 --> 25:17.948
...I wanna know what they're doing,
and I wanna know now.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.650
I'm disappointed, Auggie.

26:46.711 --> 26:48.567
Checkmate in three?

26:48.728 --> 26:50.222
You should've seen it coming.

26:55.033 --> 26:57.368
Relax. Have a drink.

26:57.530 --> 27:01.722
- I took the liberty of pouring myself...
- You were always taking liberties.

27:02.684 --> 27:04.757
Same old Gibbons.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.096
Good soldier with a bad attitude.

27:07.261 --> 27:11.124
You know, I always remember
the first day we met.

27:11.294 --> 27:13.498
I remember the last day I saw you.

27:16.607 --> 27:17.785
I bet you do.

27:20.577 --> 27:21.984
Didn't heal too well, did it?

27:22.881 --> 27:24.987
Some wounds never do.

27:25.154 --> 27:28.897
- I never asked you to go into that fire.
- You just set it and watched it burn.

27:29.059 --> 27:30.653
We did what needed to be done.

27:30.819 --> 27:33.122
Is that what you call it?
"Doing what you need to do"?

27:33.284 --> 27:37.060
Sixteen of my men killed?
What's that, just more friendly fire?

27:40.262 --> 27:41.986
Some men die so others may live.

27:43.815 --> 27:45.157
Funny...

27:45.319 --> 27:47.971
...that you never seem to be the one
doing any of the dying.

27:48.136 --> 27:51.814
I'll do whatever it takes
to best protect this nation.

27:51.977 --> 27:55.327
You're not protecting the nation.
You're doing this to protect yourself.

27:55.499 --> 27:58.915
- Why? What fires you starting now?
- We both live in the same world.

27:59.084 --> 28:01.288
- We know what's out there.
- Save the speech.

28:02.669 --> 28:04.524
Just so you know...

28:04.685 --> 28:07.785
...whatever you're up to,
you're not getting away with it.

28:08.622 --> 28:09.997
Why?

28:10.159 --> 28:12.549
Because Darius Stone
is gonna stop me?

28:13.744 --> 28:15.119
I'm sorry.

28:15.536 --> 28:18.286
Was that supposed to be
a surprise?

28:18.449 --> 28:21.068
Gibbons, I know every move you make
even before you do.

28:21.234 --> 28:23.275
You still work for me,
whether you know it or not.

28:23.443 --> 28:26.160
I never worked for you.

28:26.323 --> 28:29.707
- I work for my country.
- I don't know what's more pathetic...

28:29.877 --> 28:31.601
...a man that plays chess
with himself...

28:31.765 --> 28:34.187
...or a man that doesn't see
he's already lost.

28:39.159 --> 28:42.127
Make it look like an accident.
Zero exposure.

29:12.288 --> 29:14.678
Sir, they found Gibbons.

29:15.810 --> 29:19.258
<i>Investigators say an apparent
gas leak triggered the explosion.</i>

29:19.426 --> 29:22.177
<i>The fire department was too late
to save the occupant...</i>

29:22.340 --> 29:24.795
<i>... but managed to contain the fire
before it spread.</i>

29:24.964 --> 29:28.260
<i>The deceased, Augustus Gibbons,
was a former Navy captain.</i>

29:28.421 --> 29:29.981
<i>He was 51 years old.</i>

29:30.149 --> 29:32.452
<i>The funeral's tomorrow
at Arlington National Cemetery.</i>

29:32.614 --> 29:34.403
Gas leak. Right.

29:34.567 --> 29:37.917
<i>This is Lisa Joyner reporting from
Chevy Chase, Maryland for WJLA.</i>

29:38.088 --> 29:40.227
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

29:41.512 --> 29:43.585
Toby, let's get to work.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.509
There's nothing on here. Nothing.

29:49.675 --> 29:51.366
It's blank, man.

29:51.531 --> 29:53.921
Because you're looking
in the wrong place.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.776
Gibbons said it was
on the hard drive.

29:58.541 --> 30:00.396
What are you doing?

30:08.688 --> 30:10.379
I read about that.

30:10.545 --> 30:12.269
Cold War. Old school, right?

30:12.433 --> 30:13.677
Not that old school.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.087
All right.

30:27.734 --> 30:30.069
Now, which one's Charlie?

30:30.455 --> 30:32.877
Only one way to find out.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.891
Ready. Aim.

30:36.056 --> 30:37.333
Fire.

30:37.912 --> 30:41.045
Ready. Aim. Fire.

30:41.210 --> 30:43.894
Order arms.

30:51.229 --> 30:54.525
Like our Lord and savior...

30:54.685 --> 30:58.941
...Augustus Eugene Gibbons
died in our service.

30:59.582 --> 31:03.326
Head of the NSA, FBI, Joint Chiefs,
secretary of state.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.830
Damn.

31:04.992 --> 31:06.683
You know what this means, right?

31:06.849 --> 31:08.792
- What?
- They're gonna kill me next.

31:09.538 --> 31:11.644
- Give me those.
- Damn, man.

31:11.811 --> 31:14.714
If we're working together,
you should work on your partner skills.

31:14.883 --> 31:18.081
Like, if you want something,
try "Please," "May I borrow...?"

31:18.244 --> 31:21.179
Please, may I borrow
the binoculars...

31:21.349 --> 31:22.975
...before I kick your teeth in?

31:23.814 --> 31:27.197
Okay.
See, now, that's a start. Not bad.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.768
- Deckert?
- You know Secretary Deckert?

31:33.352 --> 31:34.563
Oh, yeah.

31:34.729 --> 31:35.939
We go way back.

31:37.578 --> 31:40.131
But he hated everything
about Gibbons.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.536
So, what is he doing here?

31:44.044 --> 31:45.899
- Charlie.
- You found him.

31:46.636 --> 31:47.814
Her.

31:48.141 --> 31:50.083
- Her?
- Can you get me a suit?

31:50.509 --> 31:52.452
Oh, so now you wanna blend.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.959
I hear this place
has the best gumbo in town.

32:23.126 --> 32:25.330
Excuse me.

32:25.495 --> 32:27.503
I'm actually meeting someone
for lunch.

32:27.672 --> 32:31.154
Relax, Charlie.
This'll only take a minute.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.506
How did you know my name?
Who are you?

32:35.930 --> 32:37.686
We have a mutual friend.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.029
Augustus Gibbons.

32:39.804 --> 32:41.462
Had a mutual friend.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.450
And you didn't answer my question.

32:43.612 --> 32:45.401
Who are you?

32:45.693 --> 32:47.766
My name is Darius Stone.

32:47.934 --> 32:49.592
Stone?

32:49.982 --> 32:52.219
You have half the suits in this city
looking for you.

32:52.383 --> 32:53.977
Why in the world
would you come here?

32:54.143 --> 32:55.420
Trust me...

32:55.583 --> 32:58.104
...they won't look for a guy like me
in a place like this.

32:58.976 --> 33:02.458
Well, no offense,
but I don't trust anybody right now.

33:03.361 --> 33:06.428
Good. That means we got
something in common.

33:06.594 --> 33:09.410
Charlie. I'm sorry I'm so late.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.427
I had that urban-youth meeting.
It ran over.

33:11.589 --> 33:13.629
We're trying to set up
that after-school...

33:13.797 --> 33:16.645
...gun-instructional program
for kids and...

33:16.805 --> 33:19.457
I'm sorry. Dickie Ambrose, NRA. Hi.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.111
Reverend Billy Bob Baker,
Southern Baptist Brotherhood.

33:22.279 --> 33:25.695
Well, it's just great
to meet you, Reverend.

33:25.864 --> 33:29.313
Hey, listen, we're setting up
this rally upstate next week...

33:29.482 --> 33:32.963
...and I was just wondering if there
was some way we could attract...

33:33.130 --> 33:36.775
...you know, some upstanding
African-Americans like yourself.

33:36.939 --> 33:38.467
You got any advice for us?

33:39.564 --> 33:41.801
Well, Dick, perhaps you could
tell your members...

33:41.965 --> 33:45.065
...to stop buying country music,
stop burning crosses...

33:45.230 --> 33:47.019
...and stop shooting black folks.

33:47.471 --> 33:48.681
Hear me?

33:49.231 --> 33:51.086
Now, if that don't work...

33:51.631 --> 33:53.323
...try a cookout with free food.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.910
Preferably fried.

33:56.561 --> 33:57.739
Dick...

33:58.609 --> 34:00.977
...would you mind terribly
if we rescheduled?

34:01.586 --> 34:03.179
I think that would be...

34:03.347 --> 34:06.348
Yeah, that's fine.
I have a lot of stuff to do.

34:06.516 --> 34:08.339
- Reverend, I'll...
- Call me.

34:08.501 --> 34:10.257
I'll call you about that.

34:16.502 --> 34:18.063
Tell me about you and the captain.

34:20.728 --> 34:23.118
I was Gibbons' contact on the Hill.

34:23.289 --> 34:26.453
I'm an aide to the Senate
Subcommittee on Military Action.

34:26.617 --> 34:27.927
Military?

34:29.690 --> 34:30.868
Deckert.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.628
Secretary of Defense Deckert?

34:32.795 --> 34:35.993
There's not a bullet shot in the dark
that he don't know about.

34:36.188 --> 34:37.465
So tell me something, Charlie.

34:38.045 --> 34:39.507
Can you get me close to him?

34:41.021 --> 34:42.745
Well, Reverend...

34:43.518 --> 34:45.821
...you think you can lay your hands
on a tuxedo?

35:32.653 --> 35:33.929
You made it.

35:34.093 --> 35:35.981
You know, I never miss a party.

35:36.141 --> 35:38.563
Not quite the tux I had in mind.

35:38.734 --> 35:40.490
Yes, but I'm blending.

35:40.654 --> 35:42.662
You see the guest of honor?

35:43.087 --> 35:44.298
Those bodyguards?

35:44.464 --> 35:47.399
SEAL Team Four. Half my old unit.

35:47.568 --> 35:48.878
And not the better half.

35:49.041 --> 35:51.180
Who's the ugly general
he's talking to?

35:51.346 --> 35:54.129
Jack Pettibone.
Vice chair, Joint Chiefs.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.656
- Doesn't look too happy.
- Must be the music.

35:57.908 --> 35:59.152
One way to find out.

36:15.832 --> 36:17.688
I truly can't believe
what I'm hearing.

36:17.849 --> 36:19.410
We go back 30 years, Jack.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.480
Same blood in the same mud, and you
never questioned my command.

36:22.650 --> 36:25.651
I presume you've heard of
the United States Congress.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.162
Jack...

36:27.324 --> 36:29.812
...this country is being led
down the wrong path.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.053
You really think you can do this,
don't you?

36:32.221 --> 36:33.716
With just a few regiments.

36:33.886 --> 36:36.570
Once we lead,
the full force will follow.

36:36.735 --> 36:37.945
The clock is ticking.

36:38.558 --> 36:40.446
With or without you.

36:40.608 --> 36:41.917
Three days.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.706
He's here.

37:11.368 --> 37:12.743
Black guy, white tux.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.166
Had enough of the party?

37:33.518 --> 37:34.828
Hold on.

37:49.203 --> 37:51.789
You asked me to track down
the rest of their old troop?

37:52.051 --> 37:54.507
Well, half of them are still enlisted.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.123
- What about the other half?
- Gone. Missing.

37:58.294 --> 38:00.269
The same men that backed
Stone against Deckert.

38:00.438 --> 38:02.610
Every single one of them
just disappeared.

38:16.443 --> 38:18.232
Wait a minute. This is your home?

38:19.035 --> 38:21.719
Not bad for a senator's aide.

38:21.916 --> 38:25.113
I'm not just a senator's aide.
I'm also a senator's daughter.

38:25.277 --> 38:27.220
James Mayweather, Virginia.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.757
Think Daddy's ready to meet
a guy like me?

38:30.174 --> 38:33.820
- Actually, Daddy's out of town.
- Really?

38:36.736 --> 38:38.297
Make yourself at home, Darius.

38:39.329 --> 38:41.501
Not a bad place to grow up, I guess.

38:41.666 --> 38:43.095
Only on the surface.

38:43.266 --> 38:46.431
Growing up in D.C. Politics
is like living in a snake pit.

38:46.595 --> 38:48.985
Everybody fighting for territory.

38:49.155 --> 38:50.978
Sounds a lot like where I grew up.

38:53.733 --> 38:56.865
Oh, no. This is nothing like
where I grew up.

38:58.855 --> 39:01.245
Let's get you out of those clothes,
shall we?

39:05.225 --> 39:06.600
Here we go.

39:07.209 --> 39:08.867
Why don't you try these on.

39:09.450 --> 39:11.011
Not really my style.

39:13.066 --> 39:15.849
Why don't you go ahead
and get cleaned up.

39:16.011 --> 39:18.151
There's some fresh towels
in the bathroom.

39:18.317 --> 39:20.008
Full-service, huh?

39:20.717 --> 39:23.587
You know, if you need anything...

39:23.758 --> 39:26.093
...l'm just right down the hall.

39:26.735 --> 39:27.979
Anything?

39:29.199 --> 39:30.793
Anything at all.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.993
How about some fries and a shake?

39:42.259 --> 39:45.227
The things I can't do for my country.

40:16.477 --> 40:18.038
Charlie?

40:28.736 --> 40:30.263
Charlie.

40:46.597 --> 40:47.808
Pettibone?

40:52.007 --> 40:53.316
She set me up.

40:53.736 --> 40:55.296
Bitch.

40:58.825 --> 41:00.483
<i>This is the police.</i>

41:00.649 --> 41:03.400
<i>Come out with your hands
behind your head.</i>

41:04.330 --> 41:06.819
We got the vice chair
of the Joint Chiefs in there.

41:06.987 --> 41:08.929
The assailant is armed
and dangerous.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.337
Proceed with extreme caution,
gentlemen.

41:11.500 --> 41:15.014
Gus, get me a hostage negotiator,
clear a two-block radius...

41:15.181 --> 41:18.182
...and five is the active perimeter.
- Better make that 10.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.206
Captain, the man's
a Special Forces sniper.

41:20.367 --> 41:23.085
Keep all fields clear
at least half a mile downwind.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.485
- Who the hell are you?
- Kyle Steele, NSA.

41:26.129 --> 41:28.617
Captain, I need to speak
to this man alive.

41:28.785 --> 41:31.469
- So?
- It's a matter of national security, sir.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.935
- Where the hell are you going?
- Going inside.

41:34.099 --> 41:37.264
Listen, I don't care who you are.
You got six minutes till we breach.

41:37.652 --> 41:38.830
Stone.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.135
I'm coming in unarmed.

41:46.518 --> 41:48.461
All right, close that door.

41:52.119 --> 41:53.298
Hands.

41:55.417 --> 41:56.759
Step forward.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.858
How you know I wouldn't shoot you
the second you stepped through?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.196
I didn't.

42:02.363 --> 42:05.430
But I do know this: You got five
minutes till they knock that door down.

42:05.596 --> 42:07.189
So let's skip the chitchat.

42:07.356 --> 42:10.227
- Where's Pettibone?
- Upstairs, dead.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.824
- You do it?
- Lf I did it...

42:12.989 --> 42:15.030
...you wouldn't know
until I wanted you to.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.988
Now, turn around.

42:20.544 --> 42:22.846
Stone, this doesn't look
too good, man.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.857
An escaped convict breaks into
a house with an automatic in hand...

42:26.018 --> 42:28.190
...and a dead man upstairs.
- I didn't break in.

42:28.354 --> 42:29.783
Now, move.

42:29.955 --> 42:31.133
You didn't break in here?

42:31.299 --> 42:33.601
So, what, the general
invited you over for a nightcap?

42:33.763 --> 42:36.382
What happened? You guys
felt like playing Russian roulette?

42:36.612 --> 42:37.922
This is not my gun.

42:38.085 --> 42:39.514
You expect me to buy that line?

42:39.685 --> 42:41.060
It's not a line, it's the truth.

42:41.222 --> 42:43.110
- They set me up.
- Who set you up?

42:44.167 --> 42:45.826
- Deckert.
- Deckert.

42:48.136 --> 42:50.078
Secretary of Defense Deckert.

42:50.729 --> 42:52.933
He clipped Gibbons
when he got too close.

42:53.097 --> 42:55.072
And now Pettibone.

42:55.690 --> 42:57.731
Too close to what?

42:58.507 --> 43:01.508
Stone, we have three minutes.
Level with me.

43:01.675 --> 43:03.749
Why are we here?
Why'd you go after Pettibone?

43:03.916 --> 43:05.957
I didn't go after nobody.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.532
I don't even know the guy.

43:07.693 --> 43:09.352
Never seen him before in my life.

43:11.246 --> 43:12.807
Easy.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.870
That sure looks a lot like you.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.608
Damn, they're good.

43:24.786 --> 43:26.696
Think now is really
the best time for a snack?

43:26.867 --> 43:28.973
What they got out there,
three teams?

43:29.140 --> 43:32.719
Flash-bangs, body armor,
heat-scopes. Am I close?

43:32.885 --> 43:34.860
Stone, I wanna help you here,
I really do.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.852
But if you run, you look guilty.

43:37.014 --> 43:39.884
Brother, I was born looking guilty.

43:40.086 --> 43:41.396
And now...

43:41.559 --> 43:43.567
...it's time for you to go.

43:45.688 --> 43:47.314
Where is he?

43:49.081 --> 43:50.805
Where is he?

43:50.970 --> 43:54.167
Captain, I got him.
Looks like upstairs bathroom.

43:54.330 --> 43:55.760
Okay, go get him.

44:42.472 --> 44:44.415
<i>This is the last known photograph
of the suspect.</i>

44:44.585 --> 44:47.303
- Cute picture.
- Yeah. Haircut suits you, definitely.

44:47.466 --> 44:48.895
<i>- near Charlottesville, Virginia.</i>

44:49.066 --> 44:51.433
<i>The assailant is assumed
to be armed and dangerous.</i>

44:51.786 --> 44:53.696
<i>One of General Pettibone's
closest friends...</i>

44:53.867 --> 44:55.722
<i>... was Defense Secretary
George Deckert.</i>

44:55.884 --> 44:58.786
<i>Jack Pettibone
was a dear friend of mine.</i>

44:58.957 --> 45:02.471
<i>And tonight, this nation
has lost a great patriot.</i>

45:02.638 --> 45:05.868
<i>And his quiet contributions
will be properly recorded...</i>

45:06.031 --> 45:07.657
<i>... in history books yet to be written.</i>

45:07.823 --> 45:10.191
<i>From base to base,
Camp Pendleton to Fort Bragg...</i>

45:10.352 --> 45:12.262
<i>... General Pettibone's troops
are en route...</i>

45:12.433 --> 45:14.222
<i>... to Washington D. C.
For the funeral.</i>

45:14.385 --> 45:16.076
They're not coming for the funeral.

45:16.242 --> 45:17.999
Same blood, same mud.

45:18.290 --> 45:21.041
Pettibone and Deckert both served
for over 30 years together.

45:21.203 --> 45:23.243
So that means
Pettibone's troops are also...?

45:23.412 --> 45:24.721
- Deckert's.
- Correct.

45:24.885 --> 45:26.543
What's that got to do
with the funeral?

45:26.708 --> 45:29.262
The perfect cover.
Deckert does the guest list...

45:29.430 --> 45:30.957
...only invites his boys to town.

45:31.926 --> 45:33.333
He's got his army.

45:33.494 --> 45:36.365
Now, he's gotta be loading up.
How would he get his gear?

45:36.664 --> 45:38.803
All orders go through
his department, the DOD.

45:39.192 --> 45:40.621
Right.

45:43.353 --> 45:44.695
You want me to hack in?

45:44.857 --> 45:46.745
To the U.S. Department of Defense?

45:46.907 --> 45:48.696
We're talking 500 acres
of hardware.

45:48.859 --> 45:50.583
Cray supercomputers,
encryption chips...

45:50.748 --> 45:54.196
...not to mention more firewalls than
the NSA, CIA and the IRS combined.

45:54.364 --> 45:55.925
Exactly.

45:56.093 --> 45:57.948
Hold my chips.

46:12.449 --> 46:14.457
You know,
you don't have to wait up.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.407
You think I'd leave you
alone with my car?

46:19.587 --> 46:21.082
What's so special about this one?

46:23.172 --> 46:27.811
Shelby Cobra prototype,
600 horses, 10,000 rpm.

46:27.974 --> 46:29.501
Only three off the rack.

46:29.671 --> 46:31.908
And we sold it for half a mil
to some senator...

46:32.071 --> 46:33.860
...who'll never take her
out of first gear.

46:34.024 --> 46:35.551
Half a mil for a car?

46:36.041 --> 46:37.896
You been gone a while, D.

46:38.057 --> 46:41.025
Everything's more expensive now.

46:44.235 --> 46:45.577
I could see that.

46:48.012 --> 46:49.573
Come here.

46:51.468 --> 46:53.608
You've done real good, Lo.

46:53.774 --> 46:57.353
No rollbacks, part bins
or stripped engines.

46:57.519 --> 46:59.308
It's a long way
from Zeke's chop shop.

47:00.335 --> 47:02.758
Still got a few bins in the back.

47:03.088 --> 47:05.707
And I still get my hands dirty.

47:12.050 --> 47:14.440
Classic's still a classic.

47:14.675 --> 47:18.156
You remember the first time
we dropped gears in this one?

47:18.708 --> 47:22.353
I remember three squad cars
at 100-plus on the parkway.

47:22.517 --> 47:24.460
Oh, she was fast.

47:24.982 --> 47:26.990
Yes, she was.

47:27.255 --> 47:30.255
You remember all that damage
we did in the back seat?

47:32.152 --> 47:34.771
That was a long time ago, D.

47:34.937 --> 47:36.311
Not for me.

47:38.170 --> 47:39.599
Ready to do some more damage?

47:42.843 --> 47:45.714
He shoots, he scores!

47:45.884 --> 47:49.562
College boy just pulled off the hack
of the century. Requisition order.

47:49.725 --> 47:52.148
Deckert's bringing all his troops
and armored vehicles...

47:52.318 --> 47:55.450
<i>...through a naval base up the
Potomac to the USS Independence.</i>

47:55.839 --> 47:58.261
It's an aircraft carrier, man.

47:59.136 --> 48:01.079
Looks like we going upstate.

49:25.112 --> 49:28.528
Well, well. Daddy's little girl.

49:52.992 --> 49:55.065
Look, Gibbons, people will believe...

49:55.232 --> 49:57.055
- Stone.
- You miss me?

49:57.217 --> 49:58.876
Apparently, we all did.

49:59.042 --> 50:01.017
She had me fooled too.

50:01.891 --> 50:03.233
Captain?

50:06.501 --> 50:08.443
Harris? Jackson?

50:08.740 --> 50:11.163
- What the hell is going on here?
- It's your old unit.

50:11.334 --> 50:14.204
And you're gonna be
joining them real soon.

50:14.470 --> 50:17.406
- What's she talking about?
- Deckert. He set us up.

50:17.575 --> 50:19.615
- For what?
- I don't know. I didn't get that far.

50:19.784 --> 50:21.694
I was hoping maybe you did.

50:24.297 --> 50:26.337
- You not going nowhere.
- Neither are you.

50:31.627 --> 50:33.799
No, no, no. Don't worry about us.

50:34.572 --> 50:36.296
You know you should've
killed that bitch!

50:44.271 --> 50:46.988
- Who triggered the alarm?
- It's Stone. He's here.

50:48.176 --> 50:51.341
Liebo, get men fore and aft.
Push him down here.

51:13.783 --> 51:15.158
Take him out now.

51:15.992 --> 51:17.847
Seal the hatch!

51:33.244 --> 51:35.962
You have green light.
Repeat, take your best shot.

51:36.125 --> 51:39.574
Old Sergeant Cobb.
You still too dumb to make captain.

51:39.743 --> 51:41.882
Lieutenant Stone.
Blast from the past.

51:42.047 --> 51:43.422
That's "Big Daddy Stone" to you.

51:43.584 --> 51:45.145
So tell me, how was prison?

51:45.312 --> 51:46.905
You'll find out soon enough.

51:47.073 --> 51:50.390
And with a mouth like yours,
they gonna love you on the inside.

51:50.977 --> 51:52.985
Let's go, let's go. Get him.

51:53.154 --> 51:54.780
Fire!

52:01.636 --> 52:03.742
Oh, I'm sorry, was that your ride?

52:03.909 --> 52:06.081
No, but yours is gonna take you
straight to hell.

52:09.062 --> 52:10.470
Loading.

52:10.631 --> 52:12.355
Stand by.

52:14.728 --> 52:16.005
Now!

52:23.466 --> 52:25.834
- Goddamn it.
- Man, that wasn't even close.

52:25.995 --> 52:29.095
Trucks, choppers. What's next?
You gonna sink the ship?

52:29.261 --> 52:30.635
Only if you're still on it.

52:30.797 --> 52:33.448
Keep this up and you ain't gonna
have nothing left, hillbilly.

52:35.854 --> 52:37.196
- Load.
- Loaded.

52:37.999 --> 52:40.138
You and I have unfinished
business, homeboy.

52:49.747 --> 52:50.762
Fire.

52:56.213 --> 52:58.253
Move! All right, come on. Let's go!

53:08.120 --> 53:09.746
- Hey!
- What the hell is he doing?

53:20.891 --> 53:23.609
Where the hell you going?
Over there. That way.

53:47.618 --> 53:49.474
Get that tank topside now.

53:52.932 --> 53:54.525
Move, move.

53:55.621 --> 53:57.988
Bravo Squad to flight deck now.

54:15.883 --> 54:17.443
Locked on.

54:24.589 --> 54:25.931
Fire now.

54:36.656 --> 54:38.250
Goddamn it!

54:58.070 --> 55:01.420
<i>All dive teams in the water.
Lock the area down.</i>

55:01.592 --> 55:03.829
<i>Zodiac One, sweep the stern.</i>

55:03.992 --> 55:07.092
<i>Zodiac Two, starboard bow,
in the midships.</i>

55:08.218 --> 55:10.226
<i>Search Boat One
and Search Boat Two...</i>

55:10.395 --> 55:13.079
<i>... widen your radius
and search the port side.</i>

55:13.243 --> 55:16.178
<i>Dive Team Number Three,
report any visual.</i>

55:18.140 --> 55:20.596
George, I'm addressing
the nation tonight.

55:20.765 --> 55:22.937
So, what's the hang-up
on the new military bill?

55:23.102 --> 55:25.688
Well, if you're reducing troops,
closing bases...

55:25.855 --> 55:28.277
...and cutting R&D,
you leave us vulnerable.

55:28.447 --> 55:30.684
George, we need to increase
international aid.

55:30.848 --> 55:33.816
We need to reverse
this isolationist doctrine.

55:33.985 --> 55:38.264
Maybe then we can turn
some of these enemies into allies.

55:39.778 --> 55:43.096
I know this doesn't particularly
thrill you, George.

55:43.267 --> 55:45.210
But this is going to be my legacy.

55:45.540 --> 55:48.672
- Sir.
- Now, the question is:

55:49.925 --> 55:51.332
Do I have your support?

55:52.038 --> 55:54.527
It goes without saying,
Mr. President.

56:03.273 --> 56:04.834
Call for you.

56:05.002 --> 56:07.424
It's about the new Lincoln
you ordered.

56:07.786 --> 56:09.892
<i>- Yeah.
- Downstairs.</i>

56:10.059 --> 56:12.394
<i>Your car. Come alone.</i>

56:29.425 --> 56:31.018
Take a look.

56:36.563 --> 56:39.946
- It's a map of the Capitol.
- A military map.

56:40.115 --> 56:42.931
- With attack routes, targets...
- I see that.

56:43.893 --> 56:45.836
- Where'd you get it?
- Upstate.

56:46.005 --> 56:48.723
Deckert's little boy scouts
are gearing up for World War IV.

56:48.886 --> 56:50.796
They got tanks, choppers.

56:51.351 --> 56:53.239
- They got Gibbons.
- What do you mean?

56:53.527 --> 56:54.957
Gibbons is not dead.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.335
He's locked up with half my old unit.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.123
- Upstate?
- Correct.

56:59.289 --> 57:00.915
Deckert is setting them up for a fall.

57:01.690 --> 57:03.829
- Fall for what?
- What do you think?

57:03.994 --> 57:06.516
This man is making a move
on the U.S. Capitol.

57:10.620 --> 57:11.930
See this?

57:12.989 --> 57:14.964
Map came from National Recon.

57:15.134 --> 57:17.469
Yeah, Deckert's making a move.
He's running security...

57:17.630 --> 57:19.485
...for the State of the Union tonight.

57:19.647 --> 57:22.495
He's not attacking,
he's guarding these targets.

57:22.848 --> 57:24.671
Oh, that's beautiful.

57:24.833 --> 57:26.262
Perfect cover.

57:26.433 --> 57:28.256
He's got his old crew
suited and booted.

57:28.610 --> 57:30.879
Look, these boys
don't play defense.

57:31.042 --> 57:32.537
Just offense.

57:37.060 --> 57:38.238
It's not enough.

57:38.404 --> 57:40.227
What if you're wrong?

57:44.326 --> 57:46.301
I was wrong.

57:46.790 --> 57:48.930
I thought you was more
than just another suit.

57:55.049 --> 57:56.740
Sir, the security detail...

57:57.130 --> 57:58.341
...they're all ex-military.

57:58.506 --> 57:59.684
Yeah, I can see that.

57:59.851 --> 58:02.601
All of them served
with Gibbons and Stone.

58:05.227 --> 58:08.294
- It's Deckert's unit.
- Think we got something.

58:15.375 --> 58:16.837
World War IV.

58:17.007 --> 58:20.237
Anything the Defense Department
needs to know?

58:22.033 --> 58:24.335
Sure it's nothing
you don't already know, sir.

58:25.842 --> 58:27.981
- George Deckert.
- Secretary Deckert...

58:28.146 --> 58:29.488
...this is Agent Steele.

58:29.651 --> 58:32.401
Kyle, the secretary wanted to check in
on the Gibbons case.

58:32.564 --> 58:34.986
I have a personal interest
in the case.

58:35.764 --> 58:37.674
Captain Gibbons was a friend.

58:38.389 --> 58:41.554
Well, you can rest assured we're
doing everything we can to find him.

58:41.718 --> 58:44.271
- Find him?
- You know, we never did ID his body.

58:46.648 --> 58:49.332
Terrible thing, accident like that.

58:50.841 --> 58:52.664
Could happen to anyone.

58:55.290 --> 58:58.804
Tell me, Kyle, what did
Darius Stone say to you?

59:00.123 --> 59:02.295
- What do you mean?
- You were the last to talk to him...

59:02.460 --> 59:03.889
...before he got away.

59:04.860 --> 59:06.584
He didn't say much.

59:06.749 --> 59:10.045
No, just a bunch of wild
conspiracy theories, that's all.

59:10.846 --> 59:12.635
Sounds like Stone.

59:15.488 --> 59:18.587
Well, if you hear anything...

59:20.353 --> 59:22.426
I'll know who to chase down.

59:24.482 --> 59:26.555
Sir, could you tell me something?

59:29.508 --> 59:31.548
I've always wondered...

59:31.716 --> 59:34.434
...how do you pick the men
who protect the president?

59:35.205 --> 59:36.732
Simple.

59:36.902 --> 59:40.220
- I choose men I can trust.
- Like Gibbons.

59:40.390 --> 59:43.206
Would've been good to have him
there tonight, huh, sir?

59:43.368 --> 59:45.736
Oh, he'll be there. In spirit.

59:46.249 --> 59:47.624
I'm sure he will.

59:48.073 --> 59:49.731
Good luck, sir.

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:10.190
Sounds like the right bank's
running leaner than the left.

01:00:10.352 --> 01:00:13.549
You wanna richen her up,
you're gonna have to remap the ECU.

01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:17.450
- What, are you surprised?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:19.341
Fact you know
how to tune up a truck.

01:00:19.506 --> 01:00:21.449
I didn't always wear a suit.

01:00:23.763 --> 01:00:25.519
- How'd you find me?
- It's my job, Darius.

01:00:25.683 --> 01:00:28.106
I'm very good at it. Can we talk?

01:00:36.631 --> 01:00:38.006
You were right.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.589
Deckert knew Gibbons was alive.
Look at this.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:46.611
President, VP, Speaker of the House,
secretary of state.

01:00:46.778 --> 01:00:49.593
The chain of command.
He takes them out, he's what?

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:52.794
- Deckert becomes the new president.
- That's right.

01:00:53.627 --> 01:00:56.661
- Cleanest revolution in history.
- Yeah.

01:00:56.989 --> 01:00:58.615
Why are you here?
Call the White House.

01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:01.629
Can't. We don't know
how deep this goes.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.088
So, what's your plan?

01:01:04.254 --> 01:01:07.190
Figure we gotta go outside the box
on this one.

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.607
How far outside the box
are you prepared to go?

01:01:15.778 --> 01:01:17.502
Because to get us close
to the Capitol...

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.838
...we're gonna need
some brothers we can trust.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.682
Ain't no place like home.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.371
Man, y'all almost had me too.

01:01:39.624 --> 01:01:41.185
They got jokes, man. You hear that?

01:01:41.353 --> 01:01:44.289
- They got jokes.
- No joke.

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:47.361
- We need your help.
- So why don't you go to the police?

01:01:47.531 --> 01:01:50.052
- We don't trust the police.
- Heard that.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.457
Hold this, baby. One second.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.409
Man, you know we got your back.

01:01:54.573 --> 01:01:56.810
But this ain't got
nothing to do with us.

01:01:56.973 --> 01:01:59.724
This got everything to do with you.

01:01:59.886 --> 01:02:03.051
Don't do it for the red, white and blue,
do it for yourself.

01:02:03.216 --> 01:02:06.697
Do it for the right to hack and jack
cars of the highest quality...

01:02:06.864 --> 01:02:09.734
...on the same block
as the White House.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.802
It's the American way of life, bro.

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:16.521
Now, if you wanna protect
that way of life...

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.212
...then you gotta step up
and fight for it.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.730
Because if Deckert takes over,
freedom won't be free for long.

01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:30.772
- Nice speech.
- Yeah.

01:02:30.935 --> 01:02:33.653
The freedom part
was a bit much, though.

01:02:36.921 --> 01:02:40.817
I got some federal heat.
Immigration, IRS.

01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:43.670
Couple of homeboys
unjustly accused.

01:02:43.835 --> 01:02:45.745
I do this for you, you'll hook us up?

01:02:46.076 --> 01:02:47.899
I'll do what I can.

01:02:50.172 --> 01:02:51.733
Fair enough.

01:02:53.309 --> 01:02:56.310
All right, fellas, get your gear together.
We got some work to do.

01:02:56.479 --> 01:02:59.414
Janky, Kevlar panels.
Killa, super jacks.

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:01.438
Dizzle, heavy-duty roll cages.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.055
Assholes and elbows,
gentlemen. Let's go.

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:08.379
Toby. To deal with these guys,
we're gonna need some serious gear.

01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:10.139
Well, it's about time.

01:03:10.306 --> 01:03:12.314
God, I am so glad
to hear you say that, X.

01:03:12.483 --> 01:03:14.785
I got some stuff you're gonna love.
Laser-scope...

01:03:14.947 --> 01:03:16.508
...frequency lock, GPS autotracker.

01:03:16.676 --> 01:03:18.881
This will tell you what perfume
a chick's wearing...

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.020
...from 30 miles away.
- That'll come in handy.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.809
So will these. Basic scramblers,
jammers, circuit jacks.

01:03:23.975 --> 01:03:26.146
Whatever you need.
Now, this is the house special.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.897
I call this one The Glove.

01:03:29.447 --> 01:03:30.625
So does everybody else.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:34.820
Not everybody else has electro-charge
pneumatic suction.

01:03:34.986 --> 01:03:36.873
Turn this bad boy on...

01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:42.920
See? Nothing.

01:03:43.084 --> 01:03:45.125
Nothing at all. Chill out
with the butt... Don't.

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.722
Just... Hey, hey. Hey.

01:03:46.893 --> 01:03:49.893
Come on, man. Why you gotta
play around here? Hey!

01:03:50.061 --> 01:03:52.997
We need firepower. Do you have
anything that shoots bullets?

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.109
I don't, but Homeland Security does.

01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:56.741
Lola. Come on, man, please.

01:04:00.272 --> 01:04:03.142
Okay. I'll just call the Pentagon
and see if they deliver.

01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:06.281
We don't have to. They've been
running weapons across country...

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:07.825
...in civilian trucks.

01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:09.514
Civilian trucks?

01:04:14.165 --> 01:04:17.199
- Man, I'm hungry.
- You just ate five minutes ago.

01:04:17.494 --> 01:04:19.731
What if I go in the back
and get a slice of cheese?

01:04:19.894 --> 01:04:22.382
You'd stop at one slice.

01:04:23.095 --> 01:04:26.479
What does Homeland Defense need
with a truck full of cheese anyway?

01:04:26.648 --> 01:04:29.169
You ain't never heard
of government cheese?

01:04:36.283 --> 01:04:37.810
Let's give them a little assistance.

01:04:42.973 --> 01:04:46.203
- Hi, boys.
- Ladies. Look like you're overheated.

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:48.821
- I know we are.
- I mean your car.

01:05:01.154 --> 01:05:02.780
I'm not going out without a fight.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:04.953
- He's retarded.
- Key's in the truck.

01:05:05.123 --> 01:05:07.676
Move the level,
because the brakes get stuck.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.953
Hi, I'm Agent Shavers.

01:05:10.117 --> 01:05:12.354
We'll be commandeering
your truck today.

01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:15.136
Man, we can't let nobody know
a white guy hijacked us.

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.863
We'll say it was 75 black guys.

01:05:34.924 --> 01:05:37.161
We got a truck full of guns,
they pay us to haul cheese?

01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:39.975
- That's not cheese?
- So, what you think, D-Train?

01:05:41.453 --> 01:05:42.663
This enough bang for you?

01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.339
God bless America.

01:05:59.987 --> 01:06:02.770
You're going to take the president out,
aren't you, George?

01:06:02.932 --> 01:06:06.511
No, captain, you are.
They pull the trigger, you take the fall.

01:06:06.676 --> 01:06:08.302
- No one would ever believe l...
- What?

01:06:08.821 --> 01:06:11.604
Augustus Gibbons
always fought the system.

01:06:11.766 --> 01:06:14.156
This week, that fight became a war.

01:06:15.062 --> 01:06:16.918
He took out his own NSA unit...

01:06:17.528 --> 01:06:19.895
...broke a convict
out of a maximum-security prison...

01:06:20.056 --> 01:06:22.927
...staged his own death, ordered
the murder of Jack Pettibone...

01:06:23.097 --> 01:06:25.946
...and rallied his old troop
of traitors for one last stand.

01:06:26.106 --> 01:06:27.448
I believe it.

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:29.651
You know what
your problem is, Auggie?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.242
You've never been able to see
beyond the bend.

01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:35.162
And you've never been able to see
beyond yourself.

01:06:38.173 --> 01:06:40.116
You've had your hero's funeral,
Gibbons.

01:06:40.286 --> 01:06:45.240
This time, they're gonna bury you
in a pine box in an unmarked grave.

01:06:46.207 --> 01:06:47.615
I'm not buried yet.

01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.016
He's one man, captain.

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:51.606
What can one man do?

01:07:15.496 --> 01:07:17.602
Deckert's got all the streets
locked down.

01:07:17.769 --> 01:07:19.176
Three blocks in every direction.

01:07:19.337 --> 01:07:21.028
There are some streets
he don't know about.

01:07:21.193 --> 01:07:22.917
At the East Capitol
and Eighth Street...

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.931
...we use alleys and warehouses
to bust out behind the Capitol.

01:07:26.091 --> 01:07:28.612
- Gonna have tanks waiting.
- Leave the tanks to me.

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.569
If it got wheels, we can jack it.

01:07:31.052 --> 01:07:32.263
Trust me, daddy-o.

01:07:32.429 --> 01:07:34.404
- All right, let's roll.
- All right, gentlemen.

01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:37.220
Lock and load. Time to ride out.

01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:40.653
The fate of the free world in the hands
of a bunch of hustlers and thieves.

01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:42.507
Why should tonight
be any different?

01:08:08.055 --> 01:08:10.674
As you can see behind me,
the president is just arriving...

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.223
The nation is eager to hear the
president's stance on pressing issues.

01:08:14.392 --> 01:08:16.399
Chief among them,
the new military bill.

01:08:24.314 --> 01:08:28.888
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

01:08:35.743 --> 01:08:38.841
<i>Mr. Speaker,
my fellow Americans...</i>

01:08:39.006 --> 01:08:42.390
...tonight I stand before you
to report...

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.134
...that the state of our Union
is strong.

01:08:50.883 --> 01:08:54.179
<i>We are at a critical moment
in our history.</i>

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:55.774
Nice.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:09:00.197
Get crunk, X. Come on, Steele,
get crunk with us.

01:09:05.415 --> 01:09:08.645
We now need the courage
to reevaluate...

01:09:08.808 --> 01:09:11.843
...the course of modern
American democracy...

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:15.238
...if we are to truly flourish
and survive.

01:09:17.099 --> 01:09:19.303
Looks like we got a little
block party up ahead.

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.707
- Go through it.
- Hold on.

01:09:33.071 --> 01:09:35.689
We must use understanding...

01:09:37.904 --> 01:09:39.246
...and compassion...

01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:43.567
- They're shooting at us.
- Welcome to the 'hood, college boy.

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:46.413
...and compromise to win battles...

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.179
...and not just the sacrifices...

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.308
...of the lives of our
young men and women.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.949
Fellas...

01:10:09.114 --> 01:10:11.383
...I don't mean to be
a back-seat driver...

01:10:11.545 --> 01:10:14.895
...but isn't that a dead end?
- There's no such thing as a dead end.

01:10:43.523 --> 01:10:45.979
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.798
Oh, shit.

01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:53.633
I think you might wanna back up
right about now.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.648
Go, go, go.

01:11:02.248 --> 01:11:03.525
Everybody out now.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:25.573
- I told you they'd have tanks waiting.
- And I told you...

01:11:25.743 --> 01:11:27.532
...if it got wheels, we can jack it.

01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:30.571
Move it. Get those jacks
out of there.

01:11:48.309 --> 01:11:51.027
Welcome to the first
tank-jacking in history.

01:11:51.382 --> 01:11:53.587
We can and must endeavor...

01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:57.549
...to win the hearts and minds
of our enemies...

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.568
...and turn them into our allies.

01:12:00.985 --> 01:12:02.927
And so, my fellow Americans...

01:12:03.097 --> 01:12:07.638
...I will ask you tonight
to support this new...

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.086
- What's going on?
- We need to move you.

01:12:12.252 --> 01:12:15.220
Remain in your seats.
No cause for alarm.

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:18.969
Okay, let's put these dubs to work.

01:12:22.175 --> 01:12:24.445
You sure you know
how to drive this thing?

01:12:28.001 --> 01:12:29.627
Just trying to get a feel for her.

01:12:31.234 --> 01:12:33.144
Yeah! I could get used to this.

01:12:37.635 --> 01:12:39.458
You know, somebody
better leave a note.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.595
Okay, split off the vice president.

01:12:41.764 --> 01:12:45.278
- What are you doing?
- Just following protocol, sir.

01:12:57.129 --> 01:12:59.104
We're in position.

01:13:10.893 --> 01:13:13.512
<i>Code red. Code red.
Small-arms fire, Capitol building.</i>

01:13:13.678 --> 01:13:15.052
<i>All units respond immediately.</i>

01:13:23.089 --> 01:13:24.747
All right, Zeke, the tank is all yours.

01:13:25.649 --> 01:13:26.926
Hey, you know what to do.

01:13:35.379 --> 01:13:37.235
I'll take lead, you lay down cover.

01:13:37.396 --> 01:13:38.890
What do you mean you'll take lead?

01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:41.134
- I'm XXX.
- Is this you, George?

01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:43.538
Are you doing this?

01:13:45.398 --> 01:13:47.406
Are you familiar
with the word "treason"?

01:13:47.575 --> 01:13:48.852
You're a Jefferson man.

01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:51.959
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.495
...with the blood of patriots."

01:13:55.226 --> 01:13:59.056
"And tyrants."
That's the end of the quote.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:01.878
I will do whatever it takes
to keep this nation safe and strong.

01:14:02.043 --> 01:14:04.248
Compassion? Understanding?

01:14:04.412 --> 01:14:06.355
What world are you living in?

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.056
Get rid of him.

01:14:13.246 --> 01:14:15.254
Okay, Zeke, do it. Do it now.

01:14:15.423 --> 01:14:17.147
- Let's redecorate.
- Fire in the hole.

01:14:26.146 --> 01:14:27.969
Two Team, 6 o'clock.
One Team, 12.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.082
Sergeant.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.058
Get Gibbons up here.

01:14:49.224 --> 01:14:51.330
Roger that. We're on our way.

01:14:52.073 --> 01:14:53.252
Let's finish this.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:08.102
- Good shooting.
- Navy SEALs. High scores, Coronado.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.644
Please. I got high score.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:12.109
But I beat them in '96.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.185
What, you don't read
the newsletter?

01:15:14.352 --> 01:15:17.386
We're coming in from the southwest
halls. We'll be with you in 30...

01:15:24.435 --> 01:15:25.646
Drop it!

01:15:26.227 --> 01:15:28.115
Now! I said, drop it.

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:38.482
What took you so damn long
to get here?

01:15:38.646 --> 01:15:41.429
Same old Gibbons.
Maybe I should put this back on.

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:46.131
Don't get a "thank you" or a
"happy to see you, Stone" or nothing.

01:15:50.106 --> 01:15:53.173
See? I told you you should have
killed that bitch.

01:15:56.347 --> 01:15:57.875
<i>Bravo to Sub Team.
Bravo to Sub Team.</i>

01:15:58.044 --> 01:16:00.118
We can still make this work
if we have Gibbons.

01:16:00.284 --> 01:16:02.107
Charlie, where the hell is he?

01:16:02.269 --> 01:16:03.447
I'm right here, general.

01:16:03.613 --> 01:16:06.396
<i>Checkmate in three.
You should have seen it coming.</i>

01:16:06.558 --> 01:16:09.908
Give up while you still can, George.
It's over.

01:16:10.687 --> 01:16:12.379
Things not going according to plan?

01:16:16.834 --> 01:16:18.012
Sir?

01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.454
Sergeant, sidearm.

01:16:19.938 --> 01:16:21.946
We'll fall back to the train.

01:16:25.892 --> 01:16:29.723
Captain, he's got to have a backup.
What would it be?

01:16:30.725 --> 01:16:32.351
There's a presidential bullet train...

01:16:32.517 --> 01:16:34.657
...three stories down
for emergency evacuation.

01:16:38.439 --> 01:16:40.065
Go after him. We'll take care of this.

01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:16.107
- Sergeant.
- You, you, out.

01:17:16.275 --> 01:17:17.998
Do what he says.

01:17:20.499 --> 01:17:22.322
No!

01:17:22.484 --> 01:17:23.859
Drive.

01:17:32.343 --> 01:17:34.962
Toby, I need a ride. Something fast.

01:17:40.409 --> 01:17:43.192
Listen up. I want three Black Hawks
on that pad, ASAP.

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:45.177
Clear the road. I got a car incoming.

01:17:45.339 --> 01:17:46.768
<i>Stay clear of the building.</i>

01:17:46.939 --> 01:17:49.307
<i>Only security and military
personnel may enter.</i>

01:17:49.468 --> 01:17:52.283
Time to throw the last punch,
lieutenant. Go get him.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.045
Heard you needed a ride.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:07.258
<i>All civilians, remain where you are
until cleared by security detail.</i>

01:18:07.425 --> 01:18:08.636
How fast does she go?

01:18:09.057 --> 01:18:10.519
Let me know.

01:18:20.965 --> 01:18:23.966
- Yeah?
- Steele, where's that train going?

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.982
- North-northwest. Straight up l-95.
- Got it.

01:18:27.143 --> 01:18:29.599
- Darius, wait a...
- He's not a big fan of waiting.

01:18:29.768 --> 01:18:31.491
Neither am I. Let's go.

01:19:32.344 --> 01:19:33.654
There it is.

01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:38.425
Okay, get me closer.

01:19:46.717 --> 01:19:48.473
Faster.

01:19:57.824 --> 01:19:59.864
Sit down, Jim.

01:20:01.217 --> 01:20:03.935
Feels good, doesn't it?
To get your hands dirty?

01:20:04.098 --> 01:20:05.472
Fuck you.

01:20:08.932 --> 01:20:12.249
Okay, let's see
what half a million buys.

01:20:34.666 --> 01:20:36.390
I can't get a clean shot.

01:20:36.555 --> 01:20:39.338
Maybe you can't, but he can.

01:21:41.214 --> 01:21:44.510
They'll just keep coming, George.
There's no way you're gonna hide.

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:48.981
Why should I hide? The man that
tried to save the president but failed?

01:21:49.152 --> 01:21:50.746
I'll be seen as a patriot.

01:21:51.777 --> 01:21:53.817
"Tried to save the president but..."
You mean...?

01:21:53.985 --> 01:21:55.774
A national tragedy.

01:21:55.937 --> 01:21:59.102
Look at it this way:
You might get your own holiday.

01:23:26.811 --> 01:23:29.300
Hillbilly, you need to lighten up.

01:23:36.062 --> 01:23:39.740
- Brakes are blown. I can't slow down.
- We won't be needing you anymore.

01:23:43.904 --> 01:23:45.498
Move.

01:24:00.325 --> 01:24:02.627
- Okay, ready.
- All right, here we go.

01:24:16.362 --> 01:24:17.955
Drop and slide, lieutenant.

01:24:18.122 --> 01:24:19.911
I don't think so.

01:24:36.879 --> 01:24:38.473
Can't hold it steady.

01:24:39.856 --> 01:24:41.034
Down.

01:24:45.842 --> 01:24:47.304
Just like old times, huh?

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:50.001
Yeah. How's that jaw, general?

01:24:50.163 --> 01:24:52.717
I think of you
every time I chew steak.

01:24:55.956 --> 01:24:58.827
And I thought of you
every night I spent in prison.

01:25:09.529 --> 01:25:11.536
Go! Run!

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:22.072
Sir...

01:25:22.429 --> 01:25:23.923
...you're gonna have to jump.

01:25:54.885 --> 01:25:56.129
Almost in.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:07.140
I've been waiting for this
for 10 years.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.073
Well, keep waiting.

01:26:19.308 --> 01:26:21.196
Your turn to do the dying, general.

01:27:09.019 --> 01:27:13.657
Wars come and go,
but my soldiers stay eternal.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.795
What's that you said?

01:27:16.349 --> 01:27:19.666
Looks like there's a man who deserves
a presidential commendation, sir.

01:27:19.838 --> 01:27:21.365
Yes.

01:27:21.982 --> 01:27:23.357
And then some.

01:27:23.519 --> 01:27:25.177
Yeah.

01:27:25.343 --> 01:27:27.100
And then some.

01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:48.445
<i>The nation is in shock today
in the aftermath of last night's...</i>

01:27:48.613 --> 01:27:51.429
<i>The assault on the Capitol has
reverberated around the world...</i>

01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.624
<i>The death toll is unknown. Authorities
say all assailants were killed.</i>

01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:56.897
<i>The attack was thwarted
by a joint effort...</i>

01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:59.007
<i>... from D. C. Police
and federal agencies.</i>

01:27:59.176 --> 01:28:01.828
<i>A group of armed assailants
managed to penetrate security...</i>

01:28:01.993 --> 01:28:03.816
<i>Sources confirm
the president is secure.</i>

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:06.150
<i>Secretary of Defense
George Deckert...</i>

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:08.836
<i>... was buried with full
military honors today.</i>

01:28:09.004 --> 01:28:12.201
<i>Secretary Deckert lost his life
while trying to rescue the president...</i>

01:28:12.364 --> 01:28:14.055
<i>... during the attack on the Capitol.</i>

01:28:14.381 --> 01:28:17.098
<i>He will be remembered as one
of our nation's greatest heroes.</i>

01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:19.018
I love this town.

01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:22.761
<i>Now, more than ever,
we need heroes.</i>

01:28:22.927 --> 01:28:24.870
<i>So it is with great pride...</i>

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.626
<i>... that I bestow this
Congressional Medal of Honor...</i>

01:28:27.793 --> 01:28:30.990
<i>... on Kyle Christopher Steele.</i>

01:28:31.154 --> 01:28:34.504
<i>And I hold this medal
for the unknown soldier...</i>

01:28:34.675 --> 01:28:36.563
<i>... wherever he may be.</i>

01:28:36.723 --> 01:28:38.447
<i>For wars come and go...</i>

01:28:38.612 --> 01:28:42.508
<i>... but my soldiers, they stay eternal.</i>

01:28:42.677 --> 01:28:45.329
Did the president just quote Tupac?

01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:48.342
Son of a bitch stole my line.

01:28:52.728 --> 01:28:53.906
So, what's this?

01:28:55.768 --> 01:28:57.329
You out?

01:28:58.938 --> 01:29:00.465
You know me, Lo.

01:29:00.634 --> 01:29:04.858
I'm only good at 100-plus
with a couple of cops on my tail.

01:29:05.019 --> 01:29:07.256
And you got a good life here...

01:29:15.102 --> 01:29:18.300
That ought to keep me going
another nine years.

01:29:20.639 --> 01:29:22.462
D...

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:25.113
...how fast did she go?

01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:29.825
Two-twenty, 225.

01:29:31.139 --> 01:29:33.922
The second-best ride of my life.

01:29:51.464 --> 01:29:53.188
D...

01:29:53.353 --> 01:29:54.880
...you forgot something.

01:30:27.058 --> 01:30:29.929
Sir, I've got some ideas
for the next XXX.

01:30:30.099 --> 01:30:31.856
I think it's my turn to choose now.

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.355
Hold on, gentlemen.
I pick the agents.

01:30:34.517 --> 01:30:38.609
I think we need to go
even further off the grid next time.

01:30:38.773 --> 01:30:41.425
Fresh face. New model.

01:30:41.591 --> 01:30:43.981
I've got the perfect candidate.
