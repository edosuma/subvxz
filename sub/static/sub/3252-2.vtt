00:03.840 --> 00:07.590
Aristotle! This is Wasp Delta,
do you hear me?!

00:09.240 --> 00:12.470
Stay with me, Kai!
Stay with me, please!

00:12.520 --> 00:14.310
Aristotle!

00:14.360 --> 00:16.950
We have been hit! Major damage!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.320
Aristotle!

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:32.479 --> 00:34.190
Aristotle!

00:34.240 --> 00:36.840
The enemy are right on top of us!

00:45.960 --> 00:49.270
I'm sorry!

00:49.320 --> 00:52.360
Exterminate!

01:16.120 --> 01:17.950
You'll probably feel a bit sick.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.750
Please, don't be.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.710
Where's my brother?!

01:21.760 --> 01:24.150
Hello, I'm the Doctor.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.270
He was right beside me.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.270
Where's Kai?

01:28.320 --> 01:29.870
How did I get here?

01:29.920 --> 01:32.230
I materialised a time capsule
exactly round you

01:32.280 --> 01:35.150
and saved your life one second
before your ship exploded,

01:35.200 --> 01:36.630
but do please keep crying.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.510
My brother just died!
His sister didn't.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.790
You're very welcome.
Put the gun down.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.590
Or what? Or you might shoot me!

01:43.640 --> 01:45.750
Then where will you be?
In charge of your vessel.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.910
You'd starve to death trying to find
the light switch. Who are you?

01:48.960 --> 01:51.790
I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue
of the Combined Galactic Resistance.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.870
I demand you take me back
to my command ship, the Aristotle,

01:54.920 --> 01:58.000
which is currently located...
No. Hey, not like that.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.870
You will take me back
to my command ship,

02:02.920 --> 02:06.110
which is currently positioned...
No, no. Come on, not like that.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.160
Not like that! Get it right!

02:12.240 --> 02:14.920
Will you take me back to my ship?

02:17.960 --> 02:19.320
Please?

02:22.520 --> 02:26.000
The Aristotle's the big fella
parked in the asteroid belt, yeah?

02:27.160 --> 02:28.830
It's shielded.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.630
More or less.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.910
Dry your eyes, Journey Blue.
Crying's for civilians.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.870
It's how we communicate
with you lot.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.270
It's smaller on the outside.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.270
It's more exciting
when you go the other way.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.150
This isn't a battleship.
Medical insignia - it's a hospital.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.710
We don't need hospitals now.
The Daleks don't leave any wounded.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.640
And we don't take any prisoners.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.910
I saved your little friend here,

03:12.960 --> 03:16.630
if that's in any way relevant to
mention. That's true, sir. He did.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.950
Thank you. You're welcome.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.510
I wish I could've done more.
Then you should have.

03:21.560 --> 03:27.790
OK. But...you did save Journey and,
for that, I am personally grateful.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.430
Well... However, the security
of this base is absolute.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.360
So we're still going to kill you.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.430
Oh, it's a roller coaster
with you, isn't it?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.430
Shoot him, bag him and
throw him outside. No! Stop!

03:41.480 --> 03:44.470
I'm sorry! He might be a duplicate.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.720
He's a doctor!

03:47.400 --> 03:49.190
And we have a patient.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.800
Don't we, Uncle?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.030
Why does a hospital need a doctor?

03:55.080 --> 03:56.910
The Aristotle wasn't always hidden.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.830
The Daleks got here before us.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.910
You don't like soldiers much,
do you?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.560
You don't need to be liked.
You've got all the guns.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.710
Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler!

04:08.760 --> 04:11.430
You know what it does, then?
It miniaturises living matter.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.830
What's the medical application,
though? Do you use it

04:13.880 --> 04:17.029
to shrink the surgeons so they can
climb inside the patients? Exactly.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.829
Fantastic idea for a movie.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.870
Terrible idea for a proctologist.
Are you going to miniaturise me?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.470
You're a doctor, aren't you?

04:24.520 --> 04:26.800
And this is your patient.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.790
No, you don't understand.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.070
You can't put ME in there!

04:38.120 --> 04:39.760
Doc...tor?!

05:15.640 --> 05:17.240
Atten-shun!

05:18.360 --> 05:20.230
Look at you lot!

05:20.280 --> 05:23.910
I've never seen such a miserable
bunch! What are you - children?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.120
Yes, sir.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.230
You think you're funny, Fleming?
Yes, sir.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.430
All right, me too. Dismissed!

05:33.480 --> 05:36.320
What you doing, Fleming?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.830
So, Mr Pink,
did you have a good weekend?

05:49.880 --> 05:53.510
Yeah, I did, thanks. Yes, I'll bet
you did. What did you get up to?

05:53.560 --> 05:57.630
Um...you know. A bit of reading.
Oh, I bet you were reading.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.870
Er, I was, yeah.
Yeah, I bet you were!

06:00.920 --> 06:03.390
Well, yeah, I was.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.070
I know your type.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.750
She wishes!

06:06.800 --> 06:08.470
Be quiet, you!

06:08.520 --> 06:12.470
So that's all the questions
on page 32, except the last one,

06:12.520 --> 06:16.750
and then everything on page 33.
All that in for Thursday.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.830
Any questions? Sir?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.390
Have you ever killed a man?

06:22.360 --> 06:24.070
I was a soldier.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.750
There were other soldiers and
some of them weren't on our side.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.070
I shall leave the rest
to your imagination.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.310
And, please,
think of another question?

06:33.360 --> 06:36.600
OK. Have you ever killed anyone
who WASN'T a soldier?

06:38.520 --> 06:42.510
Just to repeat,
that's all the questions on page 32,

06:42.560 --> 06:44.710
except the last one,

06:44.760 --> 06:48.070
and then everything on page 33.
All that in for Thursday.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.030
Is everyone clear?

06:50.080 --> 06:51.840
Yes, sir.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.670
Fine, I'll take that class

07:02.720 --> 07:05.590
and then, they can do
some of the test. I know.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.070
Oh, Clara, um, you've not met
Danny Pink yet? New fella, maths.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.190
Danny?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.870
Clara Oswald... Hey...English.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.510
Hey, nice to meet you. You too.
Watch yourself around him.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.910
Bit of a lady-killer,
but always denies it.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.230
I am not a lady-killer.
See what I mean?

07:22.280 --> 07:24.990
Oh, Beth, can I have a word?
Yeah, yeah, sure.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.870
Er...was it you that I saw outside
doing the soldiery thing?

07:28.920 --> 07:32.310
Oh, yeah, probably The Coal Hill
Cadets. Just a bit of fun.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.430
What, teaching them
how to shoot people?

07:34.480 --> 07:36.430
There's a bit more
to modern soldiering

07:36.480 --> 07:37.710
than just shooting people.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.590
I like to think
there's a moral dimension.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.910
Oh? You shoot people
then cry about it afterwards?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.600
Ah.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.870
Something wrong? Nothing, no.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.710
Sorry, no, nothing. I just...

07:50.760 --> 07:53.310
I didn't think they'd say anything,
that's all. Sorry?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.110
Have they told everyone?

07:55.160 --> 07:58.670
No, no, no, as far as I know,
nobody has told anybody anything.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.750
What are you talking about?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.110
Why did you just say
the crying thing?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.350
I was being funny. Why?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.040
I just do that.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.680
Why? I dunno!

08:12.480 --> 08:14.710
Anyway... I, erm...

08:14.760 --> 08:19.600
I've left some stuff in my class...
OK, see you. See you.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.590
Er, are you going to the, um,
leaving thing tonight for Cathy?

08:25.640 --> 08:26.950
Um...

08:32.559 --> 08:36.710
Yeah! I wasn't going, but I am now,
because you're going to be there,

08:36.760 --> 08:39.669
and, suddenly,
it seems like the best idea ever.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.270
No, I'm not.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.070
Oh, OK, never mind.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.590
Good night.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.440
Change your mind!

08:50.320 --> 08:53.950
Excuse me? I'm going.
Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.830
Um, actually,
now that you mention it,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.150
seems like the best plan ever.
Thank you.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.200
No, I've got some reading.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.790
Ah, OK.
Maybe some other time, then?

09:04.840 --> 09:07.070
Thank you!

09:11.480 --> 09:12.710
Ahem...

09:14.080 --> 09:16.640
Is the wooden sound you
or...or the desk?

09:18.680 --> 09:21.550
How long have you been there?
Longer than you would like.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.240
OK. Will you look that terrified
when you take me out for a drink?

09:27.760 --> 09:31.110
I...I absolutely promise I won't.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.320
Play your cards right and you might!

09:51.120 --> 09:52.750
Where the hell have you been?

09:52.800 --> 09:56.350
You sent me for coffee.
Three weeks ago. In Glasgow.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.710
Three weeks, that's a long time.
In Glasgow! That's dead in a ditch!

09:59.760 --> 10:01.430
It's not my fault, I got distracted.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.000
By what? You can always
find something. Come on!

10:07.280 --> 10:09.550
Why were you smiling? Was I?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.670
No, I wasn't!
You were smiling at nothing.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.350
I'd almost say you were in love,
but to be honest... Honest?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.750
You're not a young woman any more.
Yes, I am!

10:16.800 --> 10:18.910
Well, you don't look it.
I DO look it!

10:18.960 --> 10:20.910
Oh, that's right.
Keep your spirits up,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.440
Clara, Clara, Clara,
Clara, Clara, Clara.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.880
Clara, Clara.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.390
I need something from you.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.110
I need the truth.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.560
OK.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.230
Right, what is it?

10:43.280 --> 10:45.240
What's...?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.280
You're scared.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.520
I'm terrified.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.310
Of what?

10:55.360 --> 10:59.510
The answer to my next question,
which must be honest and cold

10:59.560 --> 11:02.720
and considered,
without kindness or restraint.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.080
Clara, be my pal...and tell me...

11:08.800 --> 11:10.360
..am I a good man?

11:15.640 --> 11:18.880
I...don't know.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.680
Neither do I.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.470
Er, hey, no offence,
but I've got plans.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.070
I need you.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.880
Right!

11:32.680 --> 11:33.800
Where are we going?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.870
Into darkness.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.560
Doc...tor!

11:43.320 --> 11:45.670
How do you know who I am?
He doesn't.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.390
We promised him medical assistance.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.750
Are you my doctor?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.590
We found it floating in space.
We thought it was deactivated.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.990
So we tried to disassemble it.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.550
You didn't realise there was
a living creature inside?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.070
Not till it started screaming.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.150
Help...me.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.070
Why would I do that?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.470
Why would any living creature
help YOU?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.590
Daleks will die!

12:09.640 --> 12:12.110
Die all you like. Not my problem.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.560
Daleks must be destroyed!

12:16.320 --> 12:18.720
"Daleks must be de..."!

12:21.240 --> 12:22.950
What did you just say?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.790
All Daleks must die!

12:25.840 --> 12:30.190
I will destroy the Daleks!
Destroy the Daleks!

12:32.960 --> 12:35.270
A good Dalek?

12:35.320 --> 12:36.640
There's no such thing.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.150
That's a bit inflexible,
not like you.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.350
I'd almost say prejudiced.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.030
Do I pay you?

12:47.080 --> 12:48.710
I should give you a raise.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.630
You're not my boss,
you're one of my hobbies.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.240
Come on.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.910
That was quick! This is gun girl.
She's got a gun, and she's a girl.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.190
This is a sort of boss one.
The same one as before?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.670
Yes. He's probably her uncle,

13:01.720 --> 13:03.790
but I may have made that up
to pass the time.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.590
This is Clara, not my assistant,
she's, er, some other word.

13:06.640 --> 13:10.040
I'm his carer. Yeah, my carer.
She cares so I don't have to.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.070
Doc...tor!

13:16.120 --> 13:17.830
Hello again.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.320
Will you...help me?

13:22.760 --> 13:23.870
Will you?

13:23.920 --> 13:26.590
A Dalek so damaged,
it's turned good.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.160
Morality as malfunction.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.270
How do I resist?

13:31.320 --> 13:33.470
Daleks must die.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.070
Daleks must die.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.550
So, what do we do
with a moral Dalek, then?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.830
We get into its head? Mmm.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.560
How do you get into a Dalek's head?
That wasn't a metaphor.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.190
These are nanocontrollers.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.190
Once we're miniaturised, they take
over the molecular compression.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.320
When the mission's over,
hit the button.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.630
Are you sure you understand?
Why wouldn't I?

14:00.680 --> 14:04.750
Because this is a dangerous mission
and you look like a school teacher.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.190
I AM a school teacher.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.510
Still didn't catch your name.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.830
Journey Blue. Blue?

14:11.880 --> 14:15.390
Blue, yes, problem? No, er...
I just met a soldier called Pink.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.790
Lucky fella.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.960
Lucky?

14:19.520 --> 14:20.950
From the way you smile.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.190
So, er, who makes you smile
or is nobody up to the job?

14:24.240 --> 14:27.150
My brother, but he burned to death
a couple of hours ago,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.750
so he's really letting me down
today. Excuse me.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.470
What are those ones for?
I don't need armed baby-sitters!

14:32.520 --> 14:33.950
We're not baby-sitters.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.150
We're here to shoot you dead,
if you turn out to be a Dalek spy.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.350
Well, that's a relief.
I hate baby-sitters.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.390
OK, listen up. Now, remember,
do not hold your breath

14:42.440 --> 14:45.270
when the nanoscaler engages.
You'll feel like you want to,

14:45.320 --> 14:49.310
but you must keep breathing normally
during the miniaturisation process.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.830
Why? Ever microwaved a lasagne
without pricking the film on top?

14:52.880 --> 14:54.470
It explodes?

14:54.520 --> 14:55.990
Don't be lasagne.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.430
Nanoscaler engaging in five...

14:58.480 --> 15:01.710
four...three...two...

15:01.760 --> 15:04.160
Nanoscaler engaging...now.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.470
'Nanoscaling in progress.'

15:26.920 --> 15:29.230
'Nanoscaling complete.'

15:29.280 --> 15:32.680
Nanoscaling successful.
Everyone OK in there?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.520
We made it. Nobody popped.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.510
Whoa. Ha-ha!

15:40.560 --> 15:42.320
I can't believe this!

15:47.360 --> 15:49.400
No, neither can I.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.230
We'll be following you
all the way, Rescue One.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.360
Good luck all of you. 'Integration
complete. Dalek levels steady.'

16:43.120 --> 16:46.070
That was...weird.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.510
You've seen nothing yet.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.070
What are the lights?

16:50.120 --> 16:54.430
Visual impulses
travelling towards the brain.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.360
Beautiful. Welcome to the most
dangerous place in the universe.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.040
'Entering the cranial ledge now.'

17:12.480 --> 17:13.680
Here!

17:18.960 --> 17:20.710
Oh, my God!

17:20.760 --> 17:23.670
Behold, the belly of the beast.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.829
It's amazing.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.750
It's huge.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.350
No, Ross. We're tiny.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.830
So how big is it -
that living part -

17:32.880 --> 17:36.630
compared to me and you, right now?
You see all those cables?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.830
Yeah. They're not all cables.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.390
Does it know we're here?

17:43.440 --> 17:45.750
It's what invited us in.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.950
Now, this is the cortex vault,
a supplementary electronic brain.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.840
Memory banks, but...more than that.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.350
This is what keeps the Dalek...pure.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.030
How are Daleks pure?

18:00.080 --> 18:03.790
Dalek mutants are born hating -
this is what stokes the fire,

18:03.840 --> 18:09.560
extinguishes even the tiniest
glimmer of kindness or compassion.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.390
Imagine the worst possible
thing in the universe,

18:13.440 --> 18:15.950
then don't bother, because
you're looking at it right now.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.790
This is evil refined as engineering.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.150
Doc...tor?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.830
Oh, hello, Rusty!

18:25.880 --> 18:29.830
You don't mind if I call you Rusty?
We need to come down there with you.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.150
Medical examination, and all that.
With those tentacles and things?!

18:34.200 --> 18:35.950
How close do we have to get?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.310
Well, you know, we'll never insert
a thermometer from up here.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.230
No. No, no, no, no! Stop!
Stop! Stop, you idiot!

18:47.280 --> 18:50.430
We need a way down, the only way...
This is a Dalek, not a machine!

18:50.480 --> 18:53.350
It's a perfect analogue of a
living being, and you just hurt it!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.080
So what's going to happen now?

18:57.080 --> 18:59.150
Oh, God!
What?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.750
What is it?!

19:00.800 --> 19:02.990
Antibodies?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.190
Dalek antibodies!

19:05.240 --> 19:08.790
Nobody move!

19:08.840 --> 19:10.830
Any attempt to help him,
or attack those things,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.680
will identify you as a secondary
source of infection. Stay still!

19:17.080 --> 19:19.630
But the Dalek wants us in here.
Why is it attacking?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.270
Can you control YOUR antibodies?

19:21.320 --> 19:25.350
Ross, stay calm, we're going
to get you out of this. Can you?

19:25.400 --> 19:27.760
Ross, swallow that!

19:29.040 --> 19:30.920
What is it? Trust me.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.390
Now what?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.600
ROSS!

19:48.400 --> 19:50.200
Oh, my God! What's it doing?

19:52.680 --> 19:54.110
The hoovering.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.990
Gotcha! What did you give him?
Oh, just a spare power cell.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.150
I can track the radiation signature!
I need to know

20:01.200 --> 20:03.590
where they dump the bodies.
I thought you were saving him!

20:03.640 --> 20:05.630
He was dead already!
I was saving us!

20:05.680 --> 20:08.000
Follow me and run! Run!

20:18.760 --> 20:21.830
They've dumped him in here -
organic refuse disposal.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.710
We need to get in there. Why?

20:23.760 --> 20:26.990
They won't give up till we're there!
I'd rather go in alive than dead.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.350
You don't know where it goes! Yes, I
do! Away from here! Now in! In! In!

20:32.040 --> 20:34.230
Whoa-agh-oh!

20:34.280 --> 20:36.200
I can hold them off!
No, you can't!

20:38.120 --> 20:40.040
Pull back!

20:41.520 --> 20:43.880
Down! Jump, everyone, jump!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.080
Whoa-oh-agh!

21:01.440 --> 21:03.470
Eugh!

21:03.520 --> 21:06.390
What is this stuff?

21:06.440 --> 21:09.390
People! The Daleks need protein.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.830
Occasionally,
they harvest from their victims.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.830
This is a feeding tube.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.030
Is Ross here?

21:16.080 --> 21:19.760
Yeah, top layer,
if you want to say a few words.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.470
A man has just died,
you will not talk like that!

21:24.520 --> 21:26.790
A lot of people have died.
Everything in here is dead,

21:26.840 --> 21:29.630
and do you know why that's good?
There is nothing good about that!

21:29.680 --> 21:31.510
Nothing is alive in here,
so, logically,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.270
this is the weakest spot in
the Dalek's internal security.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.310
Nobody guards the dead!

21:36.360 --> 21:39.990
Mortuaries and larders -
always the easiest to break out of.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.110
Oh, I've lived a life!

21:42.160 --> 21:45.230
Tell Uncle Stupid that we're in.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.190
Aha!

21:47.240 --> 21:48.720
A bolt hole!

21:50.040 --> 21:52.070
He'll get us out of here.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.040
The difficult part is not
killing him before he can.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.750
Bolt hole.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.630
Actually, a hole for a bolt.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.670
Does nobody get that?

22:05.720 --> 22:07.760
Also, there's the puns.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.590
Watch it,
decontamination tubes are hot.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.230
'Anomaly threat displaced.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.950
'Dalek levels returning
to normal parameters'

22:17.000 --> 22:18.950
'Rescue One to Mission Control.'

22:19.000 --> 22:21.030
This is Blue, Rescue One. Report.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.670
The Dalek has an internal
defence mechanism.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.390
'We've lost Ross.'
What kind of defence mechanism?

22:28.440 --> 22:30.670
'That thing knows
you're in there to help it!'

22:30.720 --> 22:35.360
Yeah, well, who knows? It's a Dalek!
We're going to continue the mission.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.190
Are you OK back there?
It's a bit narrow, isn't it?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.910
Any remarks about my hips
will not be appreciated.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.310
Och, your hips are fine,
you're built like a man!

22:44.360 --> 22:45.640
Thanks(!)

22:47.480 --> 22:50.710
What's that noise?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.550
Are you wearing a Geiger counter?

22:52.600 --> 22:56.160
Standard battle equipment.
That's just low level radiation.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.760
But stronger down here,
for some reason.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.120
Gimme!

23:05.320 --> 23:06.710
'Was that him?'

23:06.760 --> 23:08.750
How's he working out?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.910
Hard to say... He's... I've got it!

23:10.960 --> 23:13.430
I know what's wrong with Rusty.
OK, that's good.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.750
Is that good? Well, you know
how I said this was the most
dangerous place in the universe?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.310
I was wrong.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.360
It's way more dangerous than that.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.630
'Colonel, we have radiation
indicators red-lining in here.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.030
'The Dalek could be more badly
damaged than we thought.'

23:29.080 --> 23:33.150
Copy that. 'Old Rusty here is
suffering a trionic radiation leak.'

23:33.200 --> 23:35.430
It's poisoning the Dalek and us.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.950
Just as well we're here. Really?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.150
Perhaps we should get out
while we can.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.960
Why should we trust a Dalek?
Why would it change?

23:44.360 --> 23:47.630
Good question. Rusty?
What changed you?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.710
I saw beauty.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.280
You saw what?

23:53.080 --> 23:55.950
In the silence and the cold.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.070
I saw worlds burning.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.350
That's not beauty.
That's destruction.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.110
I saw more.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.480
What?

24:05.600 --> 24:07.070
What did you see?

24:07.120 --> 24:09.630
The birth of a star.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.670
Stars get born every day.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.870
You've seen a million stars born,
so what?

24:14.920 --> 24:18.310
Daleks have destroyed
a million stars.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.390
Oh, millions and millions.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.310
Trust me, I take count.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.190
And, yet, new stars are born.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.390
Every time.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.600
Resistance is futile.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.830
Resistance to what?

24:32.880 --> 24:35.030
Life returns.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.910
Life prevails.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.510
Resistance is futile.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.350
So, you saw a star being born.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.950
And you learned something.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.310
Dalek, do not be lying to me.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.030
Come on!

24:50.080 --> 24:52.390
'Heading for the Trionic
power cells, Colonel.'

24:52.440 --> 24:56.110
Radiation approxing 200 Rads.
Danger levels.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.040
Radiation levels increasing.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.280
We're at the heart of the Dalek.
It's incredible!

25:06.440 --> 25:08.120
Geiger counter's off the scale.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.400
Looks like it's about to blow.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.430
Good. How is that good?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.880
I like a bit of pressure.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.190
Rusty? Can you hear me? Doctor?

25:20.240 --> 25:23.040
Rusty! We've found the damage.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.360
I'm sealing up the breach
in your power cell.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.640
No more radiation poisoning,
good as new.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.030
There. Job done.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.750
That's it? Just like that?

25:47.800 --> 25:51.350
An anti-climax once in a while
is good for my heart.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.950
Rusty?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.200
How do you feel?

25:56.920 --> 25:57.960
Rusty?

26:00.280 --> 26:01.720
Rusty?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.590
Rusty...

26:04.640 --> 26:07.720
The malfunction is corrected.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.880
What's happened? Not entirely sure.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.510
It's like it's waking up.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.710
Rusty, come on, talk to me,
what's going on?

26:19.760 --> 26:23.790
The malfunction is corrected.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.960
All systems are functioning.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.750
Weapons charged.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.750
Oh, no, no, no...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.560
Exterminate!

26:36.520 --> 26:38.400
Exterminate!

26:42.520 --> 26:44.630
No, no, no... Exterminate!

26:44.680 --> 26:46.840
Exterminate!

26:48.480 --> 26:50.510
The Daleks will be victorious!

26:50.560 --> 26:53.110
The rebels will be exterminated!

26:53.160 --> 26:56.120
Colonel! What's happening out there?

26:58.760 --> 27:03.350
Exterminate! Exterminate!

27:03.400 --> 27:05.630
Exterminate!

27:05.680 --> 27:07.470
Exterminate!

27:07.520 --> 27:09.750
Exterminate!

27:09.800 --> 27:11.670
Exterminate!

27:11.720 --> 27:14.510
Exterminate!

27:14.560 --> 27:17.230
Exterminate!

27:17.280 --> 27:19.120
Pull back, pull back!

27:23.080 --> 27:25.030
Dalek fleet!

27:25.080 --> 27:27.710
Communications open!

27:27.760 --> 27:31.200
The rebel ship has been identified!

27:32.920 --> 27:35.720
Prepare for the Daleks!

27:45.400 --> 27:49.470
Doctor, what happened?
Do you see? Do I see what?

27:49.520 --> 27:51.750
Daleks don't turn good.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.550
It was just radiation
affecting its brain chemistry,

27:54.600 --> 27:57.150
nothing more than that. No miracle.
Let me get this straight -

27:57.200 --> 27:59.710
we had a good Dalek,
and we made it bad again?

27:59.760 --> 28:01.550
That's all we've done?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.150
There was never a good Dalek.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.750
There was a broken Dalek
and we repaired it.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.710
You were supposed to be helping us.
I gave it a shot.

28:08.760 --> 28:13.030
It didn't work out. It's a Dalek,
what do you expect?
No more talking, you are done!

28:13.080 --> 28:14.550
OK, new objective.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.320
We are taking this Dalek down.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.640
What's that look for?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.470
That's the look you get
when I'm about to slap you!

28:24.520 --> 28:26.510
Oh! Clara!

28:26.560 --> 28:29.030
Are we going to die in here?

28:29.080 --> 28:31.790
I mean, there's a little
bit of you that's pleased.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.190
The Daleks are evil after all.
Everything makes sense.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.310
The Doctor is right!

28:35.360 --> 28:38.910
Daleks are evil, irreversibly so,
that's what we just learned!

28:38.960 --> 28:41.950
No, Doctor!
That is NOT what we just learned!

28:42.000 --> 28:45.630
Exterminate! Exterminate!

28:45.680 --> 28:49.070
Wasp fighters to action stations!
Wasp fighters to action stations!

28:49.120 --> 28:51.550
'The security systems
have been hacked.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.470
'We don't have access to the Wasps.'

28:53.520 --> 28:54.790
Then God save us all.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.230
We need to place
the charges for maximum effect,

28:57.280 --> 29:01.360
I'm scanning the architecture.
One question. No time.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.790
Why did we come here today? What was
the point? You...

29:04.840 --> 29:08.430
You thought there was a good Dalek.
What difference
would one good Dalek make?

29:08.480 --> 29:11.400
All the difference in the universe,
but it's impossible.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.840
Is that a fact?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.760
Is that really
what we've learned today?

29:21.040 --> 29:22.320
Think about it!

29:23.520 --> 29:25.600
Is THAT what we've learned?

29:26.800 --> 29:30.070
Journey, what the hell's happening?
That thing's set the Daleks on us.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.910
'and it's locked us
out of our defences.'

29:31.960 --> 29:35.150
Journey,
you're the Aristotle's only hope.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.190
'I need you to destroy that Dalek.'

29:37.240 --> 29:40.200
The rebels will be exterminated!

29:43.320 --> 29:44.950
Whatever it takes.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.550
Understood, Uncle.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.870
I'm sorry.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.590
Yeah. Me too.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.230
Clara Oswald,
do I really not pay you?

29:55.280 --> 29:57.670
You couldn't afford me.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.030
Whatever you're going to do,
don't do it!

30:01.080 --> 30:03.470
This Dalek must not be destroyed,
we can do better!

30:03.520 --> 30:04.590
Are you out of your mind?

30:04.640 --> 30:08.030
No, I'm inside a Dalek!
I'm standing where I've never been.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.470
We cannot waste this chance.
It won't come again.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.390
What chance? I have my orders!

30:13.440 --> 30:15.830
Soldiers take orders.
And I'm a soldier.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.430
A Dalek is a better soldier
than you will ever be.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.800
You can't win this way.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.350
Ah!

30:24.400 --> 30:25.950
So what do we do?!

30:26.000 --> 30:27.830
Something better.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.990
Prepare to board the rebel ship!
We must find our comrade, Dalek!

30:33.040 --> 30:35.790
Spare no humans!

30:35.840 --> 30:39.310
Exterminate them all!

30:39.360 --> 30:41.870
Exterminate!

30:41.920 --> 30:44.190
Exterminate!

30:44.240 --> 30:46.440
Exterminate!

31:00.800 --> 31:03.950
The Dalek isn't just some angry
blob in a Dalekanium tank.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.030
If it was, the radiation would have
turned it into a raging lunatic.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.190
It IS a raging lunatic, it's a Dalek.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.070
But, for a moment, it wasn't.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.590
The radiation allowed it
to expand its consciousness,

31:15.640 --> 31:19.310
to consider things beyond
its natural terms of reference.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.310
It became good. That means
a good Dalek is possible.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.070
That's what we learned today.
Am I right, teach? Top of the class.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.190
But now it's back to how it was.
But what it saw, what it felt,

31:30.240 --> 31:33.310
is still there.
Yeah, I'm not really seeing that.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.710
Not here.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.870
There!

31:35.920 --> 31:38.270
You mean in the cortex vault?
The evil engineering?

31:38.320 --> 31:39.710
Every memory recorded.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.790
Some suppressed,
but all still intact.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.310
We need to show the Dalek
that star being born again.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.070
Recreate that moment.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.040
You need to get up there find that
moment and reawaken it.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.110
Me? Yes, you. Good idea.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.590
How?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.710
Haven't the foggiest.
Do a clever thing.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.750
And once you've done it, the Dalek
will be suggestible to new ideas.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.270
It will be open again.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.430
And I will show it something
that will change its mind forever!

32:06.480 --> 32:08.630
What? Not a clue.

32:08.680 --> 32:13.670
Docking initiated,
pressures equalised!

32:13.720 --> 32:16.480
Boarding corp, begin attack!

32:19.160 --> 32:22.230
Advance!
Exterminate the humans!

32:22.280 --> 32:26.520
Seek, locate, destroy!
Surrender is not accepted!

32:30.520 --> 32:33.960
This is crazy. There's no way we can
get back up there in time!

32:34.960 --> 32:36.910
Yes, there is. No, Gretchen.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.910
It'll bring
the antibodies down on us.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.520
Tell me the truth.
Is he mad, or is he right?

32:44.920 --> 32:46.240
I've come this far.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.630
Probably going to die anyway.

32:49.680 --> 32:53.190
Wouldn't mind something to do
for the rest of my life.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.510
Is he mad, or is he right?

32:55.560 --> 32:57.270
Hand on my heart...

32:57.320 --> 32:58.800
most days he's both.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.510
One question, then.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.960
Is this worth it?

33:07.880 --> 33:10.070
If I can turn one Dalek,
I can turn them all.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.360
I can save the future.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.990
Gretchen Alison Carlisle.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.240
Do something good
and name it after me.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.430
I will do something amazing,
I promise.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.990
Damn well better.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.590
No, Gretchen!

33:31.680 --> 33:33.200
Go!

33:37.040 --> 33:38.630
They're coming.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.000
They're coming!

33:43.520 --> 33:44.920
Grab hold of the rope.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.910
Don't look down. Good luck!

33:57.680 --> 33:59.640
Agh!

34:21.120 --> 34:23.150
Hello.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.710
I'm Missy.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.790
Welcome to heaven.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.840
Would you like some tea?

34:30.840 --> 34:32.590
Little splosh?

34:32.639 --> 34:34.080
Lovely.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.400
Fire!

34:42.199 --> 34:44.310
Exterminate! Advance.

34:44.360 --> 34:46.239
Seek, locate, destroy.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.080
Seek, locate, destroy.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.159
Exterminate!

35:01.720 --> 35:04.080
Seek, locate...

35:06.440 --> 35:10.880
Exterminate! Exterminate!

35:13.400 --> 35:14.790
Rusty!

35:14.840 --> 35:16.430
Well, here we are.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.430
Eye to eye!

35:17.480 --> 35:20.110
You cannot save the humans.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.760
They will be exterminated.

35:23.480 --> 35:27.400
I shall join the Dalek units
in the final attack!

35:28.840 --> 35:31.070
So what do we do? Er...

35:31.120 --> 35:32.470
A clever thing, quickly.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.520
Think, think, think, think, think.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.950
Some of the lights are out.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.270
Yeah, we got a damaged Dalek,
you want to complain to someone?

35:41.320 --> 35:43.430
But it's not damaged,
look at them. So?

35:43.480 --> 35:46.710
The Doctor said this was a memory
bank and some of the memories

35:46.760 --> 35:49.990
were suppressed. What if the
dark spots are hidden memories?

35:50.040 --> 35:52.070
What if one of those is the Dalek
seeing a star?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.310
Seriously?! Yeah.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.870
Well, maybe.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.110
It's either that,
or the bulbs need changing.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.510
It really could be the bulbs.
Got a better idea?

36:00.560 --> 36:02.120
Really wish I had. Yup, me too.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.680
Ah-ha. Watch out for antibodies.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
Let's see if there's an on switch.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.990
I saved your life, Rusty.
Now I'm going to go one better.

36:16.040 --> 36:21.150
I'm going to save your soul.
Daleks do not have souls. Oh, no?

36:21.200 --> 36:25.280
Imagine if you did. What then,
Rusty? What would happen then?

36:27.720 --> 36:29.070
I'm in the cortex!

36:29.120 --> 36:31.840
If there's a pack of spare bulbs,
break it to me gently.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.070
Your memories!

36:41.120 --> 36:42.630
I'm about to give some back to you.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.990
Are you OK? Clara!

36:45.040 --> 36:47.830
Yeah. I think there was
some sort of energy charge.

36:47.880 --> 36:53.270
You got the first lights on.
Of course, it's a brain.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.870
Brains work with electrical pathways
linking up memories!

36:56.920 --> 37:00.560
It's working! It's working,
we're turning the memories back on!

37:01.880 --> 37:04.760
All those years ago, when I began...

37:06.640 --> 37:12.560
I was just running. I called myself
the Doctor, but it was just a name.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.280
And then I went to Skaro.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.200
And then I met you lot
and I understood...

37:23.360 --> 37:25.240
..who I was!

37:27.600 --> 37:31.000
The Doctor was not the Daleks!

37:34.960 --> 37:37.160
Exterminate!

37:38.560 --> 37:39.600
Fall back!

37:41.200 --> 37:43.000
Exterminate!

37:45.680 --> 37:48.080
Exterminate! Exterminate!

37:54.040 --> 37:57.000
You'd better get a move on,
there's company coming!

38:01.160 --> 38:03.950
Exterminate!

38:04.000 --> 38:05.870
Exterminate!

38:05.920 --> 38:07.030
Fall back, fall back!

38:07.080 --> 38:10.280
Exterminate! Exterminate!

38:14.360 --> 38:15.520
Hurry up!

38:17.480 --> 38:18.720
Show me a star, Rusty!

38:21.360 --> 38:23.430
Oh, look. It's your memories again.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.160
It's like somebody's
mucking about up there.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.510
Memories, all those memories.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.550
D'you remember the star
you saw being born?

38:34.600 --> 38:36.110
Almost done!

38:36.160 --> 38:39.440
One more to go. Hurry up, Clara!
Hurry up!

38:47.320 --> 38:49.550
Clara, you did it! It's rebooting.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.120
The antibodies have reset!

38:56.680 --> 38:59.760
I... I...remember.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.510
You saw the truth, Rusty.

39:03.560 --> 39:08.590
Remember how you felt!
You saw a star being born!

39:08.640 --> 39:12.030
The endless rebirth of the universe!

39:12.080 --> 39:16.390
No! And you realised
the truth about the Daleks!

39:16.440 --> 39:19.750
Truth? What is the truth?

39:19.800 --> 39:23.150
Let me show you the truth!
I've opened your mind

39:23.200 --> 39:25.360
and now I'm coming in.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.790
That door is never going to hold.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.000
But I'm damned if I'm going
to make it easy for them!

39:45.320 --> 39:47.270
I'm part of you.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.430
My mind is in your mind.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.190
I see your mind, Doctor.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.320
I see your universe.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.560
And isn't the universe beautiful?

40:01.680 --> 40:03.160
I see beauty.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.310
Yes, that's good. That is good.
Hold on to that.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.920
I see endless, divine perfection.

40:13.640 --> 40:18.510
Make it a part of you.
Remember how you feel right now.

40:18.560 --> 40:21.590
Put it inside you and live by it.

40:21.640 --> 40:25.390
I see into your soul, Doctor.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.150
I see beauty.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.230
I see divinity.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.590
I...see...

40:31.640 --> 40:33.320
hatred.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.870
Hatred? I see your hatred
of the Daleks and it is good.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.070
No, no, no.

40:43.120 --> 40:47.630
You must see more than that,
there must be more than that!

40:47.680 --> 40:53.190
Death to the Daleks. Death to
the Daleks! Death to the Daleks!

40:53.240 --> 40:54.710
No, there must be more than that.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.630
There must be more than that!
Please!

40:56.680 --> 40:58.950
Daleks are evil.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.240
Daleks must be exterminated!

41:03.560 --> 41:04.800
Daleks are evil.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.400
God save us all!

41:08.480 --> 41:10.560
Daleks must be exterminated!

41:21.480 --> 41:23.310
Exterminate!

41:23.360 --> 41:25.920
Under attack from a Dalek!

41:40.000 --> 41:44.320
The Daleks are exterminated!

41:45.560 --> 41:47.430
Of course they are.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.120
That's what you do, isn't it?

42:02.120 --> 42:03.520
Journey! Uncle Morgan.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.470
I have transmitted a retreat signal.

42:07.520 --> 42:11.310
The Daleks will believe
the humans have initiated

42:11.360 --> 42:13.520
the ship's self-destruct.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.230
What about you, Rusty?

42:21.280 --> 42:23.000
I must go with them.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.390
Of course you must.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.790
You've unfinished work, haven't you?

42:28.840 --> 42:31.030
Victory is yours.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.990
But it does not please you.

42:34.040 --> 42:38.360
You looked inside me and you saw
hatred. That's not victory.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.630
Victory would have been
a good Dalek.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.200
I am not a good Dalek.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.960
YOU are a good Dalek.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.000
Till the next time.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.950
Is he leaving?
Isn't he going to say goodbye?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.120
I think that was it.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.270
Yep, that was it.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.960
Sorry, got to run!

43:27.320 --> 43:29.470
I'm sorry.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.000
Sorry?

43:36.760 --> 43:37.880
Doctor!

43:42.360 --> 43:43.720
Take me with you.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.230
I think you're probably nice.

43:51.280 --> 43:56.110
Underneath it all, I think you're
kind and you're definitely brave.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.280
I just wish you hadn't been
a soldier.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.400
How do I look?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.950
Sort of short and round-ish,
but with a good personality,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.110
which is the main thing.
I meant my clothes.

44:31.160 --> 44:34.240
I just changed. Oh, good for you,
still making an effort.

44:35.440 --> 44:40.910
OK, right, you're back in your
cupboard, 30 seconds after you left.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.400
When will I see you again?

44:44.320 --> 44:46.230
Oh, soon, I expect.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.270
Or later.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.680
One of those.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.040
I don't know.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.830
I'm sorry?

44:58.880 --> 45:02.840
You asked me if you're a good man
and the answer is...I don't know.

45:04.680 --> 45:09.400
But I think you try to be and
I think that's probably the point.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.440
I think you're probably
an amazing teacher.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.040
I think I'd better be.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.800
Ah, hey! Hey, Danny.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.720
Have you changed your clothes?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.070
Yes.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.870
Yes, I, I have, well noticed.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.350
OK, good. Yes, very good, good work.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.750
You passed the test.

45:39.800 --> 45:43.110
Are you really going to go
for a drink with me?

45:43.160 --> 45:46.470
Yeah, course I am.
Why wouldn't I?

45:46.520 --> 45:51.790
I just thought... What? You might
have a rule against soldiers.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.150
No.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.720
No, not at all.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.480
Not me.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.670
There is someone
that I always wanted to meet.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.760
It's Robin Hood!

46:06.240 --> 46:07.640
No damsels in distress!

46:09.040 --> 46:10.590
Seize him!

46:10.640 --> 46:12.630
No pretty castles.

46:12.680 --> 46:15.400
No such thing as Robin Hood.
