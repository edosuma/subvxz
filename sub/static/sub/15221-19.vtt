<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel</i>

<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped</i>

00:08.908 --> 00:10.842
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.448 --> 00:18.042
<i>He awoke to find himself</i>
<i>trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:21.713
<i>facing mirror images</i>
<i>that were not his own...</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:25.918
<i>and driven by an unknown force</i>
<i>to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:31.029
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,</i>
<i>an observer from his own time,</i>

00:31.097 --> 00:35.693
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram</i>
<i>that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.803 --> 00:41.103
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself</i>
<i>leaping from life to life,</i>

00:41.174 --> 00:44.268
<i>striving to put right</i>
<i>what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.344 --> 00:47.177
<i>and hoping each time</i>

<i>We're losing her, Doctor.</i>
Do something!

00:58.591 --> 01:01.082
Doctor?
Doctor, are you all right?
Uh-

01:01.161 --> 01:05.029
- Yeah, I-I just need a second
to figure out what-
- [ Continuous Beep ]

01:05.098 --> 01:08.556
- She's in full arrest!
- Oh, no.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.100
She's gone.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.734
No. She can't be.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.212
It's your fault.
What?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.748
She trusted you, and you killed her!
You bastard!

01:22.816 --> 01:26.183
You murdered my wife!
Oh, boy.

You killed my wife!

I didn't, I swear.
You're a doctor.
You're supposed to save lives!

02:46.132 --> 02:48.566
Well, let go, and I'll try.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.569
God!

02:50.637 --> 02:53.401
Doctor, what are you doing?

02:53.473 --> 02:55.373
She's still alive.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.341
What? Are you sure?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.901
I'm a doctor. I know if somebody's
dead or alive or not.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.606
Give me some adrenaline, now.
Some what?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.615
Adrenaline, now! Go on!

03:03.683 --> 03:05.446
Okay.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.385
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to save her life.

03:13.626 --> 03:17.722
I'm sorry. Could somebody tell me
what's going on here?
<i>[ Man ] Cut. Cut. Cut.!</i>

<i>[ Bell Ringing ]</i>
What are you doing to me, Kyle?
I'm two hours behind schedule,

03:20.667 --> 03:22.931
and you're makin' passes
at dead extras.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.903
I'm sorry.
Take five, sweetheart.
All right, everybody, take lunch.

03:25.972 --> 03:29.772
<i>Is there a problem, Roger?</i>
Yeah, there's a problem. Your star
can't seem to keep his mind on his work.

03:29.842 --> 03:34.302
I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry.
Yeah, yeah. Well, tell the studio that
when we don't finish tomorrow's show.

03:34.380 --> 03:38.009
Look, relax. I'll take care of the suits.
I'm sure Kyle was just trying
to lighten things up a bit. Right?

03:38.084 --> 03:42.885
That's right.
A guy has a little success,
and all of the sudden he's Olivier.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.890
Come on.
I'll buy you a coffee.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.859
I guess I kind of- I guess I kind of
screwed things up a little bit.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.919
You know Roger. A lightbulb blows,
he takes it personally.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.931
Besides, it can't be easy
when you're in every scene.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.968
Well, that's for-
Every scene?

03:56.035 --> 03:57.832
I promise, right after ratings week's over,

03:57.904 --> 04:00.168
we'll sit down and see
about lightening your load.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.868
Yeah, that-that-that
would be great.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.534
Funny, isn't it?
Hmm?

04:04.611 --> 04:06.545
An actor spends his whole life
trying to become a star.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.514
Then when it happens,
he doesn't have time to enjoy it.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.516
Sometimes, I wonder
what the hell we're doing here.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.747
Yeah, well, I was just wondering
the same thing myself.
Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.812
Hot off the presses.

04:16.889 --> 04:21.189
That's me?
How does it feel to be lusted after
by every housewife in America?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.593
Surprising.
Oh, listen, everything's
set for this afternoon.

04:26.032 --> 04:30.298
This afternoon-
Your lunch date with
the detergent contest winner.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.533
Oh, yeah, right.
Her name's, uh, Norma Jean Pilcher.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.837
Sounds like a real wildcat.
You have lunch at Chez Ramone.

04:36.909 --> 04:40.845
You smile for about an hour.
Then it's over. Unless, of course,
she turns out to be a fox.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.847
A fox.
Yeah, right. Right.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.316
Listen, is there any way
we could maybe postpone this?
I'm feelin' really beat.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.752
Afraid not. Soap people
have too much invested in it.

04:48.821 --> 04:53.451
Besides, they're our biggest sponsor.
Look, I know it's a pain, but that's
the price you pay for being number one.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.323
Yeah, right.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.522
Keep it, Dr. Hunk.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.995
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Hey, Sam, where are you?</i>

05:01.067 --> 05:04.935
<i>Where am I? Where</i>-
<i>What are you doin'over there?</i>

05:07.674 --> 05:11.235
Gee. Suddenly I feel kinda sick.
<i>Would you come here?</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:13.245
<i>Huh?</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:15.247
Would you get over here
and stop foolin' around?

05:15.315 --> 05:20.048
I think maybe
I need some intensive care.
Get-Al.

05:20.119 --> 05:25.352
What are you so uptight about?
You've just leaped into
the hottest hunk on daytime television.

05:25.425 --> 05:29.088
I'm on a soap opera.
We prefer " daytime drama.''

05:29.162 --> 05:32.063
We-You mean-
You mean, you watch this stuff?

05:32.131 --> 05:35.726
Oh, uh, Tina had me watching some of it
when I was down with the flu.

05:35.802 --> 05:40.330
Sam, you wouldn't believe the things
that go on on these shows.
Okay. All right.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.466
I mean, everybody is sleeping...
I know. I know.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.876
with everybody.
I know! Will you-
Spare me the details, all right?

05:46.946 --> 05:50.438
What's goin' on?
Okay. It's, uh, May 4, 1 985.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.780
You're in Los Angeles.
Mm-hmm.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.843
Your name is Kyle Hart,

05:54.921 --> 05:58.550
and for the past three years
you've been playing Craig Connor-

05:58.624 --> 06:00.558
Dr. Craig Connor-
Yeah.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.560
on a show called
<i>Moments To Live.</i>

06:02.628 --> 06:05.859
<i>Moments To Live.</i>
Can you believe that title? I mean,
I hate the sound of this already.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.163
Why am I here?
Well, we're not sure.

06:09.235 --> 06:15.196
You're not-
No, Ziggy, uh, had a new
data search component installed,

06:15.274 --> 06:17.469
and we had to have it
shipped in from Hong Kong.

06:17.543 --> 06:22.207
And I think that gave
a little jet lag to the modem
of the floppy disc.

06:22.281 --> 06:26.615
Why do you make this stuff up all the time?
Why don't you just say to me,
"Sam, we don't know.''

06:26.686 --> 06:31.123
Why don't you just do that for once
instead of makin' it up all the time?
Well, that wouldn't be any fun.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.590
This is fun?
You know what I have to do today?

06:33.659 --> 06:38.460
I have to go and have lunch
with some woman who won
this soap detergent contest.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.193
Oh. Well, look at it this way.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.792
At least you know she'll be clean.
[ Laughing ]

06:43.870 --> 06:45.838
Have a good lunch.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.374
<i>You don't know how long</i>
<i>I've been dreamin'about this.</i>

06:52.445 --> 06:58.281
Imagine me, Norma Jean Pilcher,
havin' lunch with the finest
heart surgeon in this country.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.320
Oh, yeah, right.
That's my character from the show, yeah.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.321
<i>Moments To Live</i>
is more than a show.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.847
It is a window to another world.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.590
I feel like I know everyone
at Mercy General, especially you.

07:11.664 --> 07:15.794
You sound like you're a big fan.
The biggest.
Hank says I'm obsessed.

07:15.868 --> 07:19.531
Hank?
Yeah, Hank, my husband.
Except I took it off for you.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.506
I hope you don't mind.
Not if Hank doesn't mind.

07:22.575 --> 07:26.807
I have been planning this for the longest time.
I must have entered that contest 300 times.

07:26.879 --> 07:30.940
I got enough laundry detergent
to last me a lifetime.

07:31.017 --> 07:35.351
No kidding. And Hank's okay with
you bein' out with another man?

07:35.421 --> 07:37.514
You are not another man.

07:37.590 --> 07:42.425
You are the finest
heart surgeon in this entire country.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.725
Yeah, well-
You are kind...

07:44.797 --> 07:48.460
and gentle and good.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.559
Well, thank you.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.696
What's Hank do for a living?

07:54.774 --> 07:57.004
He fixes things.
Things?

07:57.076 --> 08:00.341
Yeah, you know, washers and dryers
and toasters and things.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.711
It ain't nothin' like bein' a doctor.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.411
You're not from around here,
are you?
Oh! Does it show?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.977
Just a little.
Oh!

08:09.055 --> 08:13.719
I grew up in Tennessee.
Hank and me, uh, moved out here
about four years after we got married.

08:13.793 --> 08:18.492
My mama has a house
just north of here.
That's nice.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.555
Has everything been okay?
Oh, the best.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.158
I had the best time.
Great.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.966
That's great.

08:26.038 --> 08:30.168
It's you!
Oh, my God, it's really you!

08:30.243 --> 08:32.506
It's him. I hope I didn't
interrupt anything.

08:32.578 --> 08:36.035
Actually, we were just
getting ready to leave.
I'm with my friend, Thelma.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.811
She's sitting right over there.

08:38.885 --> 08:43.116
She's a little shy, anyway.
I-I told her it was you over here,

08:43.188 --> 08:44.622
and she said, no, it couldn't be you.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.387
It could only be you if you were with
a model or with an actress.

08:48.461 --> 08:52.329
<i>But then I said maybe you're with</i>
<i>your cousin or with your sister.</i>

08:52.398 --> 08:57.097
<i>But I couldn't be sure unless I came over,</i>
<i>so that's what I did.</i>

08:57.169 --> 09:00.764
Well, here you are.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.537
Here I am. And I don't mean to be rude,
but we were just getting-

09:04.610 --> 09:08.979
Would you do me a big favor?
Would you just pose for a picture with me?
Oh, well-

09:09.048 --> 09:12.245
<i>It won't take a minute,</i>
<i>I can't believe it's really you.</i>

09:12.318 --> 09:14.616
Hon, would you do it?

09:22.728 --> 09:25.663
Say " cheese.''
[ Softly ]
Cheese.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.792
Whoa- Oh, my God.
Look what I have done.

09:29.869 --> 09:33.566
Have I ruined it?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.265
<i>I just got this for my birthday.</i>

09:37.343 --> 09:41.609
Really? Well, happy birthday.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.672
Shall we go?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.010
<i>I hope I didn't</i>
<i>embarrass you back there.</i>

09:48.087 --> 09:52.649
Well, accidents happen.
Oh, what a magnificent sky.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.250
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, nice.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.388
Rose for your lady, mister?
No-No, thanks.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.695
Oh, sure. Why not?
How much?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.327
Three bucks.
Keep the change.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.338
Oh, Nurse Bronson was right.
You are a saint.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.967
It's just a flower.
Not to me.
It's the Garden of Eden.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.671
Yeah, well, um,
I'll get the car.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.180
Oh, God.
I forgot my purse.
Oh, I'll go get it.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.445
No, no. You stay right here.
I gotta go powder my nose.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.419
Don't go away, now, you hear?
<i>[ Portal Opens ]</i>

10:22.488 --> 10:26.481
<i>I wonder if,uh</i>-
<i>I wonder if they ever</i>
<i>really powder their noses.</i>

10:26.559 --> 10:29.687
Who cares?
Is that the big contest winner?

10:29.762 --> 10:32.526
Norma Jean Pilcher, yeah.
Norma Jean Pilcher?

10:32.598 --> 10:36.034
That sounds like
one of the Beverly Hillbillies.
Well, closer than you think.

10:36.102 --> 10:41.062
The big date is not going well?
Well, she's having a little trouble
separating the actor from the role.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.904
You know what I mean?
Yeah, that can be kind of scary.

10:43.976 --> 10:48.470
No, what's scary is havin'
to go in front of those cameras.
Now, have you found out why I'm here?

10:48.547 --> 10:50.913
Sort of.
Sort of?
Sort of is not good enough.

10:50.983 --> 10:54.384
I need to know exactly.
I gotta get out of here
before those cameras roll on Monday.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.683
I don't think you have
to worry about that.
Why not?

10:56.756 --> 11:01.125
Well, because in the real history,
Kyle Hart never showed up for work.
What?

11:01.193 --> 11:03.388
He just-
<i>Sorry to keep you waitin'.!</i>

11:03.462 --> 11:05.054
Oh, yeah.
Ready to go?

11:05.131 --> 11:08.225
Yeah, I just gotta have them
bring the car up, and I'll-
No, that won't be necessary.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.234
Okay, let's go.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.236
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>You mind tellin'me</i>
<i>what's goin'on here?</i>

11:12.304 --> 11:14.363
And ruin the surprise?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.068
We know Hart disappeared,
and Ziggy's tryin' to get details.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.737
Yeah, well, why don't you
speed it up a little bit, okay?

11:19.812 --> 11:22.110
Let's go. Come on.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.240
<i>Hang in there, Sam.</i>
<i>Try and humor her or somethin'.</i>
Get in. Move.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.079
I'll be there as soon
as we get something.

<i>I gotta get outta here, Gooshie.!</i>

<i>Norma Jean, this is a mistake.</i>
<i>You're never gonna get away with this.</i>

<i>[ Norma Jean ]</i>
<i>Get away with what?</i>

11:46.372 --> 11:49.136
Whatever it is you're doing.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.233
I mean, there are gonna be
people looking for me.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.937
What people?
<i>People.</i>

11:53.012 --> 11:55.207
You know, people from the show.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.374
It's just a matter of time
before they realize I'm gone.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.475
He's right, you know.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.180
When he don't show up,
they're gonna know somethin is wrong.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.620
Damn, we should've thought of that!
<i>[ Norma Jean ]</i>
<i>Would you relax?</i>

12:04.690 --> 12:07.625
I got everything under control.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.221
Is it money you want?
Because if it's money,
you can have it.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.233

No. We don't want your money.

You gonna ransom me? What?

Too many people.

<i>have a baby, do you?</i>

25:08.106 --> 25:10.631
- Don't you like babies?
- Of course I like babies.

25:10.709 --> 25:15.442
Me too. I love the way they smell
and the way they feel.

25:15.514 --> 25:19.280
I-I think I'm gonna make
a good mama.
<i>I'm sure that you will.</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:24.448
But you can't just kidnap a person
and then force them to father your child.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.015
Oh. You see,
you still don't understand.

25:28.093 --> 25:31.529
I have waited the longest time
for this.

25:31.596 --> 25:33.860
I've waited and I've searched...

25:33.932 --> 25:37.459
until I finally found the perfect father.

25:37.536 --> 25:42.166
- Me.
- The way you treat those patients
at Mercy General.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.175
It makes me feel so proud.

25:45.243 --> 25:47.734
The same kind of pride
our child's gonna feel.

25:47.812 --> 25:52.306
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor, okay?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.909
<i>My name is not Connor.</i>
<i>It's Hart.</i>

25:54.986 --> 25:57.386
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

25:57.455 --> 26:00.583
You better drink your tea
before it gets cold.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.228
- How does Hank feel about all this?
- Feel? What-

26:06.298 --> 26:11.429
It's gotta bother him a little bit
to know that his wife
wants to be with another man.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.767
I do not want to marry you.

26:13.838 --> 26:15.772
I just wanna have a baby with you.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.933
That doesn't strike you
as the least bit unusual?

26:19.978 --> 26:22.503
I like unusual.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.608
[ Sighs ]
This is crazy.

<i>I'm gonna make dinner for us.</i>

26:46.204 --> 26:50.300
You know, she reminds me
of my second wife,
only her specialty was small appliances.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.840
<i>Gee, Sam,you don't look too good.</i>

26:53.912 --> 26:56.210
- Norma wants me to help her have a baby.
- Oh, is she pregnant?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.579
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

26:58.650 --> 27:02.051
Well, if I were you, I-
<i>Ay-yi-yi.!</i>

27:02.120 --> 27:07.217
Wait a minute.
You mean that she wants to-with you?

27:07.292 --> 27:10.693
Boy, this is really getting weird.
<i>Getting?</i>

27:10.762 --> 27:15.665
- Al, I think she's insane.
- Paranoid, with tendencies
toward delusions and violence.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.828
I'm hoping that that's a guess.
<i>Ten years ago,</i>

27:18.903 --> 27:22.066
Norma Bates-
that's her maiden name-was-

27:22.140 --> 27:26.406
- What?
- That's the same as Norman Bates,
the guy in <i>Psycho.</i>

27:26.478 --> 27:29.641
<i>Ah. Oh, never mind, Sam.</i>
<i>Never mind. I'm sorry.</i>

27:29.714 --> 27:33.206
Make believe I didn't say that, okay?
She was confined...

27:33.284 --> 27:36.913
in-in this state-run
psychiatric hospital in Tennessee.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.252
Why?
<i>Well, she was livin'on the streets,</i>

27:39.324 --> 27:42.782
and the cops picked her up
because she attacked a movie usher.

27:42.861 --> 27:46.592
Then she got treated,
and eventually they released her
'cause she didn't have any family.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.862
What about her mother?
<i>Her mother O.D. 'd</i>
<i>when she was six years old.</i>

27:49.934 --> 27:53.870
According to the police report,
apparently the kid had a ringside seat.
<i>No, no.</i>

27:53.938 --> 27:56.202
Al, I met her mother.

27:56.274 --> 28:00.370
No, you met Mildred Reynolds.
Ziggy did some more digging,

28:00.445 --> 28:04.381
<i>and apparently she had a roommate</i>
<i>in the psychiatric hospital</i>-
<i>Mildred Reynolds.</i>

28:04.449 --> 28:06.781
And I suppose her father
did not die in Korea.

28:06.851 --> 28:11.345
<i>The best we can find is that</i>
<i>her father left even before she was born.</i>

28:11.423 --> 28:13.357
The kid had an ugly childhood.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.258
Which is why she wants
this baby so badly-

28:16.327 --> 28:18.625
so that she can be the parent
that she never had.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.892
Al, I gotta get outta here.
<i>You stay put.</i>

28:20.965 --> 28:24.958
Ziggy still projects an 80% chance
that if you try and run,
you're gonna get killed.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.938
<i>So I'll go back and I'll run</i>
<i>some more scenarios on escapes,</i>

28:29.007 --> 28:30.998
and maybe I can reduce
the odds a little bit.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.567
<i>Just hurry up, all right?</i>
<i>She's planning dinner,</i>

28:33.645 --> 28:37.274
and I got a feeling that...
I'm the dessert.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.942
Yeah. Okay.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.423
<i>Here we go.</i>

28:46.491 --> 28:49.289
Careful now.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.261
I don't see why
I have to be blindfolded.

28:52.330 --> 28:56.562
Come on, now. Come on.
Get ready. Get ready.

28:56.634 --> 28:59.501
Are you ready?

28:59.571 --> 29:01.505

29:02.574 --> 29:05.543
I know it ain't like a roof
of a penthouse apartment,

29:05.610 --> 29:09.478
but I figure
if we use our imaginations,
it'll do just fine.

29:09.547 --> 29:12.539
I appreciate all the effort
you've gone to here,

29:12.617 --> 29:14.778
but I'm really not ready for this.

29:14.853 --> 29:19.085
I need a little more time.
Now, you are just nervous.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.354
I am that, but I-I just feel like
we should wait, okay?

29:22.427 --> 29:25.396
I'm tired of waitin'.

29:25.463 --> 29:29.126
Oh, God.
I almost forgot the best part.

What-What happened?

38:10.721 --> 38:14.384
We were talkin', and all of a sudden,
he just grabbed his chest
and he hit the floor.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.291
- His chest?
- I saw something like this once
at Mercy General.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.793
- Can you help him?
- Not like this.

38:24.635 --> 38:28.833
Oh, my God.
What if somethin' happens to him?

38:32.643 --> 38:34.873
Is he alive?
<i>Barely.</i>

38:34.945 --> 38:37.413
I'm not sure, but I think
he ruptured his left ventricle.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.472
Well, you can fix it, right?

38:39.550 --> 38:41.882
I'm gonna have to operate.

38:41.952 --> 38:45.388
Here?
Unless you've got a better idea.

38:45.456 --> 38:48.653
Well, maybe we should call for a-a-
A what?

38:48.726 --> 38:50.318
For an ambulance.
There's no time.

38:50.394 --> 38:55.161
I'm gonna have to get
some kind of sharp knife or something.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.530
This'll do.
All right, now, listen to me.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.728
Are you sure you can do this?

38:59.804 --> 39:01.669
Remember the time I operated
on that woman in the elevator?

39:01.739 --> 39:06.540
Well, yeah, but that was-
that was so long ago.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.272
<i>We're running out of time here, Norma.</i>

39:12.583 --> 39:16.713
Oh, Hank.
Okay. You hold him now.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.381
Oh!
[ Whimpering ]

39:32.269 --> 39:36.137
No. No, you can't do this!
[ Sobbing ]

39:36.207 --> 39:38.573
Why?

39:38.642 --> 39:42.078
Because-
<i>Because why?</i>

39:42.146 --> 39:46.242
Well, because- because-

39:46.317 --> 39:50.447
- Say it, Norma.
- Because-

39:50.521 --> 39:52.785
Say it, Norma.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.382
Oh, you're not a doctor!

39:58.562 --> 40:00.928
[ Sobbing ]

40:02.400 --> 40:07.497
Oh, Hanky! Hank!

40:08.839 --> 40:11.774
Oh, my- Oh, what is this?

40:11.842 --> 40:14.003
What is this?
Norma, it's gonna be okay.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.979
<i>You need help, honey.</i>

40:21.652 --> 40:25.782
Norma!
You did it again, didn't you?

40:25.856 --> 40:29.451
You and your stupid plan!
Sam, she's headed for the river.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.621
What?
I should have blown your head off
when I had the chance!

40:32.696 --> 40:35.494
You changed history.
Now she's goin' to the bridge,
and she's gonna jump off and drown herself.

40:35.566 --> 40:39.093
We gotta go after her, Hank.
Why? So you can tear her apart-

40:39.170 --> 40:41.934
We'll talk about this later.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.847
- Norma?
- Stay away from me!

40:59.890 --> 41:04.020
<i>Norma, I know you're in a lot of pain.</i>

41:06.664 --> 41:10.862
But believe me,
this is not the answer.

41:10.935 --> 41:14.462
There are no answers.
<i>Sure there are.</i>

41:14.538 --> 41:19.237
They're just not always
the ones that we wanna hear.
<i>Yeah, well</i>-

41:19.310 --> 41:24.577
I thought if I could have a baby,
then maybe I could start all over again.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.639
I know.

41:30.788 --> 41:34.315
I mean, why did my mama do it?

41:34.391 --> 41:37.519
Why did she do it?
I mean, you just-

41:37.595 --> 41:41.531
You shouldn't just do somethin' like that
in front of your own child.

41:41.599 --> 41:44.159
She was just confused.

41:46.070 --> 41:50.939
Yeah.Just like me.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.740
Like everybody.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.610
We all get confused sometimes.

41:57.681 --> 42:02.948
<i>Me too. Now,</i>
<i>why don't you just come on</i>
<i>over here and let me help you?</i>

42:07.558 --> 42:10.584
Hey, Norma,
we never did have our dance.

42:10.661 --> 42:13.391
Like Reb-
Like Rebecca Waincroft?

42:13.464 --> 42:16.058
Just like Rebecca Waincroft.

42:18.302 --> 42:20.566
Now,

42:20.638 --> 42:23.402
just give me your hand.

42:26.810 --> 42:30.871
I can't.
<i>Yes,you can.</i>

42:30.948 --> 42:33.974
Just reach out and take it.

42:36.654 --> 42:39.487
Come on.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.548
Come on.

42:44.128 --> 42:47.256
That-a-girl.That-a-girl.

42:47.331 --> 42:49.561
Real easy. I got you.

42:49.633 --> 42:54.297
Real easy. Easy.
I got you. I got you.

42:54.371 --> 42:59.399
Okay. Everything's all right.
Everything's okay.
[ Sobbing ]

42:59.476 --> 43:05.278
I just wanted it to be
like it is on television.

43:05.349 --> 43:11.288
Why can't it be
like it is on television?
I don't know.

43:13.624 --> 43:15.615
I don't know.

43:17.528 --> 43:21.362
Mr. Hart? Mr. Hart?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.798
Yeah?
I'm gonna need your signature
on the arrest report.

43:23.867 --> 43:25.858
Okay.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.203
I hate to bother you
at a time like this,

43:30.274 --> 43:32.572
but it would mean a lot to my wife
if I could get your autograph.

43:32.643 --> 43:34.838
Oh, great.
Thanks.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.605
You just made me a hero at home.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.673
Glad to be of help.

43:44.989 --> 43:47.651
<i>[ Ziggy Beeping ]</i>

43:47.725 --> 43:51.559
Sam, your good deeds are unending.
Yeah.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.824
<i>What happens to them?</i>

43:53.897 --> 43:56.559
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Well, Hank gets convicted</i>
<i>ofkidnapping and assault...</i>

43:56.634 --> 43:59.865
<i>and serves six years</i>
<i>with time off for good behavior.</i>

43:59.937 --> 44:03.373
And then he ends up
opening a little fix-it shop
next to the hospital.

44:03.440 --> 44:06.136
Hospital?

44:07.911 --> 44:10.505
- <i>Does she ever get out?</i>
- Yeah, but not for a while.

44:12.049 --> 44:15.985
<i>And she and Hank,</i>
<i>they even end up together.</i>
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

44:16.053 --> 44:19.113
I think.

44:19.189 --> 44:23.888
What about Hart?
Does he stay on the show?
I think the answer just drove up.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.893
<i>Kyle.! Thank God you're all right.</i>

44:27.965 --> 44:31.332
Yeah.
You are all right, aren't you?

44:31.402 --> 44:33.336
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

44:33.404 --> 44:36.862
They told me what happened.
Must have been a nightmare.

44:36.940 --> 44:39.670
Well, let's just say
I'm-I'm glad it's over.

44:39.743 --> 44:42.576
I told the studio,
this is the last damn contest
we get involved in.

44:42.646 --> 44:47.049
It's not worth it.
Listen, I checked with my therapist.

44:47.117 --> 44:48.675
He says in time,
you'll forget everything.

44:48.752 --> 44:51.118
I'll bet you're beginning
to block it out already.

44:51.188 --> 44:55.386
No, I-I don't think that
I'll ever forget what happened here.
Really?

44:55.459 --> 44:58.917
Well, in that case,
maybe we should take advantage
of the situation.

44:58.996 --> 45:01.294
Take advantage?
Well, I was just thinking.

45:01.365 --> 45:04.630
It might be interesting,
not to mention a ratings bonanza,

45:04.702 --> 45:09.571
if we were to, say,
incorporate a similar ordeal into
the life of one Dr. Craig Connor.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.768
Hmm? I'll call the studio.
Welcome back.

45:15.512 --> 45:19.346
Did you hear that?
He wants to take what happened
to me here and put it on the show.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.145
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I heard, yeah.

45:21.218 --> 45:24.119
Is that ethical?
It can't be ethical.

45:24.188 --> 45:26.520
No, it's television.
