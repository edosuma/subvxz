[director] So are you
seeing Grindah again?

00:20.280 --> 00:22.880
We're just sort of
seeing what happens.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.320
I'm worried if we rush into it,
then it might go back to Grindah
taking me for granted.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.960

I'm like a different person.

-See you later then.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.160

-All right then, I'll text you.

getting along well.

-Very cosy.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.560
Do you reckon you'll
get back together?

01:04.599 --> 01:07.400
I dunno. We're just sort
of seeing how it goes.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.760
I mean, getting rid of that hair
definitely helps his chances.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.320
Yeah. Just need to sort
the rest of him now.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.960
we're gonna send Steve
down there to give a bit
of a message of our own.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.840
Exactly.
Grindah told him to write,

01:52.880 --> 01:56.360

in their studio, innit?
-Exactly.

-No one messes with Kurupt FM.
-No one.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.760
[Steves] Wait, you want me
to write, "No one messes
with Kurupt FM"?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.840
No, "We didn't snitch"! So they
know the man ain't a snitcher.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.640
Sorry, yeah, no.
Cos you said... Oh, yeah.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.080
Where's Steve, anyway, man?
He's taking time.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.320
-Hold tight Steve on a secret
mission and that, yeah.
-Yes. Top secret.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.280
I'm gonna write in all capitals
as well so it's aggressive.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.400
Yeah, I'm saying, caps lock,
"We didn't snitch".

02:21.440 --> 02:24.680
And I love this tune, Decie.
Man like!

-What's that? What the fuck?

02:30.360 --> 02:33.400
I stole their dog. They left it
tied up outside and I stole it.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.000
-Why the fuck did you
steal their dog?
-To send a message.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.840
-Like you said.
-What fucking message?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.920
"Don't fuck with Kurput FM
or...we'll steal your dog".

02:40.960 --> 02:43.840
Steve, you put us in
a hostage situation, great(!)

02:43.880 --> 02:46.480
-What should I do with it?
-Treat it like a hostage.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.120
-What, like, blindfold it?
-No, not blindfold it!

02:49.160 --> 02:52.320
It's too late now.
It's seen everything anyway.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.680
So we don't wanna be putting
more risk with, like,
a dangerous dog

do you know what I'm...

03:07.600 --> 03:09.480

-I'm not scared of dogs!

Stop, riling...
Beats, stop, riling him up.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.680
He's well safe. Look at that.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.600
Steves, look at me.
Stop riling him up.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.280
Does your T-shirt fit you OK?

03:26.320 --> 03:29.760
Yeah, it's... Yeah, it's nice.
Really good fit.
Thank you, boss.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.080
-Excellent, nice one.
Just call me Sam.
-Oh, sorry, yes. Thanks, Sam.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.560
OK, so we'll just start
off pretty easy, just
show you the ropes.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.120
Don't worry about that, mate.
Throw me right into the deep
end, mate. No foreplay.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.680
Just get me straight
on the floor.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.000
You won't be doing
any sales this week.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.520
-Oh, why?
-That comes later, once
you've done your training.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.160
Yeah. Why don't we just have
a little walk around the store?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.680
Show you where things are. So
here we've got the home audio.

has low moments now and again.

So sometimes you gotta do
some shit like this.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.280
This is just temporary, mate,
this is not permanent.

04:10.320 --> 04:15.840

-Girthy, curved.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.440
-Yeah, I'm a bit curved

-Cool.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.760
Just follow me. And stop me

so far, Charlie.

getting on with here. So we'll
keep you busy, don't worry.

Hopefully, I haven't missed
Angel's performance.

-No, not yet.
-Oh, OK, perfect.

make up with me quickly, yeah.

of something at the moment.

for the same part?
-Yes, she is.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.840

Nervous, why? But you're the
best one here, you know that.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.760
My hopes and dreams with Angel
are that she becomes
really successful,

05:32.800 --> 05:36.320
makes loads of money and
we can just live in LA
in a big mansion,

05:36.360 --> 05:39.600

watch her rise to fame.

the Rose Italia at sunset,

tonight, otherwise
we'll have to look after
your dog for way too long.

So be there - the Rose Italia,
sunset and...

07:12.400 --> 07:14.880
Let's say 6:00pm,
to be on the safe side,

07:14.920 --> 07:18.680

clear what time sunset is.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.360
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.920
OK. Well, thanks for coming.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.600
-Thank you so much.
-OK... OK, thanks.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.040
We will see you tomorrow,
Angel, OK?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
I just wanted to give you
a little FYI.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.560
The lighting on the stage is
quite unflattering, so you know,

10:54.600 --> 10:56.800
obviously, on the big night,
that'll probably be
sorted out, will it?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.840
OK, yes. Duly noted, but
thank you so much for coming.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.600
-Angel, we'll see you tomorrow.
-Just give you Angel's
business card.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.560
-Yeah, OK.
-And we look forward
to hearing from you.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.240
OK, great. Thanks.
We will let you know.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.080
OK. Thank you, Angel,
and I will see you tomorrow.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.760
Great. Sooner rather than later
will be better with the dates...

11:13.800 --> 11:16.760
Fine. If you just wanna make
your way out through there.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.320
-Bye, class, great to see you.
Thanks so much for your time.
-Bye!

11:20.360 --> 11:22.840
Right then, Ange, got a lot
of practice to do, haven't you,

11:22.880 --> 11:24.560
if you wanna make it?
Come on, let's go.

11:24.600 --> 11:29.080
Er, yeah, there's,
like...three...six of us

11:29.120 --> 11:31.280
and then I don't know
how many of them.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.880
-We're having a sort of sit-down
with a rival station...
-Why are you...?

11:34.920 --> 11:38.200
-There's a dog involved.
-Don't tell them everything,
Jesus!

11:38.240 --> 11:41.160
Hello, mate.
Sorry about that. Erm...

11:41.200 --> 11:44.440
Yeah, no, we're gonna need
a table for around 12
at six o'clock.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.320
-And a dog.
-Yeah, nothing weird, just
two...two spag bol and that.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.520
-Nice one, Pepe. Bye.
-Beats, why did you say 12?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.880
How many do you reckon
there's gonna be of 'em?

11:54.920 --> 11:57.520
Good to have extra chairs,
innit?

11:57.560 --> 12:00.880
No, cos you lot are all gonna
be standing while I sit there.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.040
You know, arms folded and that,
like, sort of power play
sort of shit.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.200
Well, I ain't gonna stand
if there's 12 chairs.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.720
-I'll stand.
-OK, well, let's decide
what we're doing now.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.000
Cos this is a dangerous game
we're playing here, yeah?
This is life or death.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.120
-Life.
-What?

12:17.160 --> 12:19.720
No, it's not a question,
Steves. It's just a saying.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.280
We just need to
sort this shit out.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.920
Listen, if you're worried
about getting stabbed, Roche's
got a stab-proof vest...

12:25.960 --> 12:29.000
No one's getting stabbed, Beats,
and no one's wearing
a stab-proof vest.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.640
I'm gonna go home after this
and see them one last time,

12:31.680 --> 12:34.440
-so I'll pick it up for you.
-What do you mean,
"one last time"?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.880
Stop putting shit in my...
Tell 'em it's...

12:36.920 --> 12:38.760
I don't know what
the bros are like.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.560
You're meant to be
the rational one, Decoy.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.640
Decoy, tell me I'm
not getting stabbed!

12:43.680 --> 12:45.920
You'll be all right, hopefully.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.960
-Hopefully, what?
-Boys...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.520
I'm gonna go.
Before we meet, yeah?

12:50.560 --> 12:53.080
Yeah, I'm just gonna...
I need to chat to you outside.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.520
<i>I'm not scared of Kold FM.
Why do you keep saying
I'm scared of Kold FM?</i>

12:56.560 --> 12:58.760
Don't constantly put that
in there and say that, yeah,

12:58.800 --> 13:00.880
cos man ain't scared of, like,
Kold FM at all, like.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.560
You lot keep back here.
You're bating me out.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.400
<i>I'm just trying to sort it out.
That's all I'm trying to do.</i>

13:06.440 --> 13:09.800
I'm just a man at it,
that's all I am,
do you know what I mean?

13:09.840 --> 13:12.760
The man is definitely
not scared.

13:12.800 --> 13:17.560
[Angel sings "Amazing Grace"]

13:20.200 --> 13:23.400
Right. OK.
That's a good start.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.760
Do you want me to give you any
notes or do you wanna do it
on the next one?

13:26.800 --> 13:31.880
-I want some notes.
-OK. I think the big issue is
your singing isn't very good.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.480
I think that's the one thing
we really need to work on here.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.560
Cos otherwise we're
not gonna get anywhere
with this career, are we?

13:38.600 --> 13:42.720
Can I ask you a question,
would you pay to see someone
sing who can't sing?

13:45.040 --> 13:47.720
Sorry? No. Exactly, so...

13:47.760 --> 13:49.800
-Do you wanna just do it again?
-Yeah.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.760
OK, and in your head,
you just need to think,

13:51.800 --> 13:54.440
"I'm a really good singer,"
as you sing.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.800
Although I haven't had fame
myself, I could've done if
I'd had me when I was younger,

13:58.840 --> 14:01.760
pushing me in the way
that I'm pushing Angel.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.080
If she would just believe what
I'm telling her, then she'd
be able to do it.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.760
-How can you make that better?
-D-flat?

14:08.800 --> 14:11.200
D...? What's that?
Is that a musical thing?

14:11.240 --> 14:13.840
<i>-So do you wish your mum
had pushed you into fame?
-Yeah.</i>

14:13.880 --> 14:16.200
If my mum wasn't so bothered
about just sort of
marrying everyone

14:16.240 --> 14:18.880
and actually spend a bit
more time sort of pushing me

14:18.920 --> 14:21.720
to do some singing or ballet
or whatever, then, yeah,

14:21.760 --> 14:24.240
I could be on
the stage right now.

14:24.280 --> 14:29.320
-[knock on door]
-Right, that's not great timing
but just keep practising.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.440
-Hi, you all right?
-I need to talk to Angel.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.760
OK.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.360
-Angel.
-Yeah?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.040
-Roche.
-Yeah?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.120
Do you know where, erm,

14:52.160 --> 14:55.200
-the stab-proof vest is?
-Why?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.680
I just wanna show it
to Grindah.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.560
-It's in one of them boxes
on top of the wardrobe.
-Cool.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.640
Don't forget you're looking
after Robin tonight.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.600
-What? Isn't Craig about?
-No, he's out
with his girlfriend.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.200
She loves it, to be fair.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.760
Grindah says they were going
flat out the other night.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.440
-Didn't they realise that
he was on the top bunk?
-No.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.040
Apparently, condensation was
dripping off the ceiling.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.280
-Oh, God!
-Yeah.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.200
Tried to sleep through it
but he couldn't.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.680
Ended up going out with him
for a fag after Craig
had finished up.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.000
Lovely.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.880
-Cool, where was it? Upstairs?
-Yeah, upstairs,
on top of the wardrobe.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.800
Maybe you empty out the boxes
while you're at it.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.880
[director] Where did the
stab-proof vest come from?

15:40.920 --> 15:45.200
[Roche] Stab-proof vest
came from when I used to do
nightclubs but I had to stop.

15:45.240 --> 15:49.360
-Cos of the baby?
-Nah, nah, I got done
for GBH a few years back

15:49.400 --> 15:52.800
and banned from all late-night
venues across the UK.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.000
He should have remembered
his fucking ID.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.880
He should be banned, not me.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.440
Boys!

16:05.440 --> 16:07.560
It's official.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.920
No one's getting stabbed.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.000
Take a seat.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.880
All right. I've got something
important to tell you.

16:22.520 --> 16:27.160
I've never shown you this
before, but this is daddy's
gold microphone.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.160
And I want you to look after it.
Be careful. Hold it.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
And if anything
happens to me today,

16:32.840 --> 16:36.240
I want you to always remember
that Daddy stood up for
what he believes in.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.200
MC-ing?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.560
Sort of. More pirate radio.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.720
But the point is, your
daddy is a soldier. OK?

16:45.760 --> 16:48.320
-OK.
-Why are you
giving her your mic?

16:48.360 --> 16:51.080
The truth of it is
that Angel might have to

16:51.120 --> 16:53.080
take over where her daddy
left off, innit?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.960
What? What do you mean?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.280
I need to talk to you as well.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.200
I've been thinking about my life
a lot recently, these
last few hours,

17:00.240 --> 17:03.520
and I need to tell you
something before it's too late.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.640
-OK.
-I want us to get back together.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.800
Cos I actually do love you
and that, and it's
just stupid, innit?

17:09.839 --> 17:13.000
-You've never
said that before.
-Well, yes, I probably have.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.160
-No, whenever I say it,
you just say good.
-That's still a positive.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.839
<i>When you're life's at risk,
yeah, it makes you think
differently.</i>

17:18.880 --> 17:21.240
<i>Especially if you're involved
in the street shit...</i>

17:21.280 --> 17:23.240
that I'm into, do you know
what I mean, like?

17:23.280 --> 17:27.280
Where we're from, every day you
gotta stare death in the face.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.680
And tell him to fuck off.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.520
Look, if I make it back then
maybe let's get married,
then, like.

17:35.560 --> 17:39.200
Do you know what?
Miche, will you marry me?

17:39.240 --> 17:41.640
Well, I don't know.
You know, it's quite...

17:41.680 --> 17:44.040
-I need a bit of time
to think about it all.
-Sure.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.120
This has been a mental day,
you know, with Angel's
audition and everything.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.120
-She wasn't really on top form,
so I just need a bit of time.
-You are so right.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.560
Of course it's a tough decision.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.960
I'm just about to go off
and serve in a radio war.
You're right.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.200
-OK.
-Just don't forget me, yeah?

18:00.240 --> 18:03.400
And look after each other.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.560
-[he sighs]
-[Miche] Yes!

18:05.600 --> 18:07.040
What?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.400
Yeah?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.480
-Course I wanna marry you.
-Sick!

18:14.520 --> 18:18.080
But... I mean, I ain't
got no rings or anything,
cos I thought of it in there.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.440
No, that doesn't matter cos I've
still got one from before, so
yeah, I'll wear that now.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.960
-Ah, innit sweet?
-Well, good luck
in your radio thingy.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.440
-Cool, man. In a bit. Sweet!
-All right.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.000
-See you boys in a bit, yeah?
-Bye!

18:29.040 --> 18:30.520
Yes!!!

18:35.920 --> 18:40.080
More like an investment,
cos you're always gonna need
a printer, aren't you?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.440
That's right in my line of work.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.480
There's the kind of
the premium range, which...

18:45.520 --> 18:47.480
Psst! Psst!

18:48.840 --> 18:51.120
Oi, you all right?

18:51.160 --> 18:54.240
-Sorry, you talking to me?
-Yeah. Charlie,
part of the sales team.

18:54.280 --> 18:59.120
I can do you a really good
price on that, if you want.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.600
Special offer. Erm...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.920
£189.99.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.400
-That's just what
it says on the tag.
-OK.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.280
I can see that you're a very
shrewd businesswoman,
just like myself.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.800
So I'll tell you what,

19:15.840 --> 19:19.920
I'll throw in something extra,
yeah, just give me...
Wait, wait there.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.160
OK.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.200
I'll give you these headphones
for free if you buy it now.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.080
-What?
-I'll throw them in for free.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.440
-Sorry, sorry.
-Er, yeah, deal.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.480
-He's new. We can't do that
deal. I'm really sorry.
-What?

19:36.520 --> 19:38.800
Charlie, you know you're not
supposed to be making sales.

19:38.840 --> 19:42.760
No, I know, but we shook...
I've shaken her hand,
I can't unshake it.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.520
-Can we just...? Thanks.
-Sorry.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.120
Is there any way
I can help you at all.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.560
Er, no, no, you're
all right, thanks.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.240
-That was unacceptable, OK?
-I had it in the bag, man.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.040
No, I told you,
you are not a salesman.

19:58.080 --> 20:02.280
Go back to the stockroom
and do what I told you to do.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.000
I don't know what
he's laughing about.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.040
Why is he allowed
on the shop floor?

20:07.080 --> 20:09.040
"Mark".

20:09.080 --> 20:11.560
-If that is your real name.
-OK, I think you should...

20:11.600 --> 20:13.520
Get back to work,
forget all about this.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.760
His name's Malik. I saw it
on his passport the other day.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.920
-It's not.
-No.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.440
He's got a fake bloody ID.
You got him on the shop floor.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.760
-You should get Charlie
on the shop floor, mate.
-OK, chin up, get on with it.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.040
I'm on to you, Malik!

20:28.080 --> 20:30.720
[waiter]
Here's your lasagne, sir.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.080
-Is it all right to sit down
just until they get here, or...?
-No, Steves.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.880
No, it's going down
a bit weird.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.080
-Nervous a bit?
-Quite an intensive situation.
I'm not nervous.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.360
Just excited about it all.
It's about to go sick.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.120
When I'm nervous I get these
weird little cat shits.

20:49.160 --> 20:53.280
-Yeah, don't talk about...
I'm eating.
-Do it.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.120
How is it? Is it all right?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.160
Does it, like, feel weird
and all that?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.520
-Does what feel weird?
-Well, the vest, innit?

20:59.560 --> 21:01.800
I'm not wearing a vest, Decoy.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.520
Ah, shit!

21:03.560 --> 21:05.160
-What?
-They're here.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.400
Just shut up, shut up,
stop freaking me out.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.400
Everyone straighten your backs,
look raw, look hard.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.360
-Why are there cameras here?
-[gruff] Don't worry about it.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.160
What you doing the voice for?
Don't worry about the cameras.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.680
They're filming us.
We'll blur your faces out.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.440
We're doing a documentary on
Kurupt FM, cos we're the baddest
station in West London.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.360
-[Beats] Exactly.
-Where's the dog?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.200
-[Grindah] Take a seat.
-[Beats] Take a seat first.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.920
Espresso.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.440
First of all, we need to talk
about your little graffiti
project.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.040
-Yeah, what about it?
-Why did you write that
on our station?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.280
-Cos you called
the police on us.
-We would never do that.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.400
Yeah, we would never
ever do that!

21:52.440 --> 21:54.840
Exactly. Dunno about
you boys, yeah,

21:54.880 --> 21:57.120
but in our game, we've
got a thing called a code.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.400
No chicks on radio.
Pay your subs on time.

21:59.440 --> 22:03.120
-Standard.
-And no snitching. We'd never
let a snitch in our circle.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.560
Yeah, we'd never do that.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.720
Milk.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.040
In a sit-down, yeah, it's
all about the power play.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.960
<i>You've gotta let that other
person know that they're
beneath you at every moment.</i>

22:20.320 --> 22:24.280
<i>Even something as little
as a handshake can show 'em
that you mean business</i>

22:24.320 --> 22:26.440
<i>and you ain't a joke out here.</i>

22:26.480 --> 22:29.760
Cos man ain't a joke,
right, remember that.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.320
-Hey, knock, knock.
-Hey, man, how's it going?

22:38.360 --> 22:41.840
Good. How's it going with you?
You're channelling
your inner octopus?

22:41.880 --> 22:46.080
-Yeah!
-Cos after that I've got a
couple more boxes for you to do.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.680
-Oh, OK, yeah.
-Yeah.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.160
OK.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.320
No problem, "boss".

22:55.360 --> 22:57.560
-[Sam] You talking to me?
-Yeah, yeah, sorry.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.120
-No, no problem at all.
-Yeah.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.640
Sam's all right.
I mean, listen. He's a
bit of a kind of a warrior.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.440
He thinks he'd got his way with
me. He thinks he can control me.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.120
But no one can control Chabuddy.
I do my own thing
when I want to.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.400
I'm the boss of me.
You know what I mean?

23:13.440 --> 23:15.400
I don't run by anyone's rules.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.160
I'll do what I want, mate.
I'm a free spirit, you know?

23:18.200 --> 23:20.000
-Charlie?
-Yes? Yes, boss?

23:20.040 --> 23:22.800
-Your lunch break's over.
-Yeah, no worries. I'll...

23:27.280 --> 23:30.120
Sorry. Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I was just...

23:30.160 --> 23:33.040
Does anybody else want a little
coffee or anything while I'm...

23:33.080 --> 23:35.880
-Quiet, Steves.
-Only I get a coffee,
Steves, you know the rules.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.120
-I wouldn't mind a tea.
-Shut up, no one's getting
a tea. What's the...?

23:39.160 --> 23:41.840
-Sorry.
-Right. This is
getting out of hand.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.880
I've got a wife at home
that's missing her dog.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.160
-Yeah, I'm got family
as well, see?
-Same.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.360
I gave my gold mic
away to them today

23:48.400 --> 23:51.080
-and said that I'm ready
to die tonight.
-What?

23:51.120 --> 23:54.720
Why would you...? Why don't you
just give me back the dog, yeah?

23:54.760 --> 23:57.000
First, you gotta
change your frequency.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.160
108.6 is just
way too close to 108.9.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.760
Change it or the dog gets it.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.640
What about 108.3?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.680
107.5.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.360
108.0.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.680
Phew, you drive a tough bargain,
my friend.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.680
107.9.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.160
Anything under 108.0
and we've got a deal.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.040
What's wrong with you?
I've just said 107.9, that's
underneath what you said.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.720
OK, then, deal.
We've got a deal, deal.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.040
-Where's the dog.
-Steves, go and get the dog.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.840
Alive?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.320
-Just get it.
-Yeah, alive.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.480
[sniffs deeply]

24:41.040 --> 24:43.040
[sniffs deeply]

24:43.080 --> 24:46.160
-Ah, Jesus Christ! Is it...?
-Yeah.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.520
-Have you changed her yet?
-No.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
-Go and do it.
-OK.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.800
-Fantasy.
-Yeah.

24:51.840 --> 24:56.080
Can you bring the bag, please?
It's a two-man job.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.240
-Oh, Mum!
-All right?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.440
-Come here.
-I got the Prosecco.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.720
Oh, thank you.
Oh, lovely and fizzy.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.480
-What is it? You look happy.
-You should guess, Mum.
Go on, guess it.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.960
-You're not gonna believe it.
-What, what, what?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.800
-Did Angel get the part?
-No, better than that.

25:12.840 --> 25:16.320
Oh. Come on then, what is it?
I ain't got a crystal ball.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.640
-Ta-dah!
-Oh!

25:18.680 --> 25:21.080
That is nice, babe.
Where d'you get that?

25:21.120 --> 25:24.240
-Well, Grindah.
The wedding's back on.
-What?!

25:24.280 --> 25:27.080
I thought I set you up with
that hairdresser bloke, Matias?

25:27.120 --> 25:31.480
-He said you keep texting him.
-Like when I was drunk, I sent
him some stuff and it wasn't...

25:31.520 --> 25:34.560
Mum, it doesn't matter. Me and
Grindah are meant to be
together.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.560
-We're a fairytale romance.
-Really?

25:37.600 --> 25:41.240
Well, I guess that does make
the Matias situation a little
less complicated.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.000
-Oh, OK.
-Get some glasses?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.480
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.400
-How's everything going?
Is it all right?
-Good, thank you.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.960
-You can't bring
that in here, mate.
-Pepe, back off!

25:56.000 --> 25:58.160
If you mess this up,
people are gonna get hurt.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.520
-See you later, Sniff.
Take care of yourself.
-Just let go.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.280
-You're a good dog.
-Just leave him now, yeah?
Just leave him.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.640
-Get off him. Can you just move?
-I'll miss you.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.160
-Just get off him, bruv.
-Come and see me any time.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.400
He's not gonna
come and visit you.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.120
-We all good there?
-Yeah, we're done.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.480
-All right.
-All right.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.840
Deal.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.840
Just remember.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.360
Kurupt FM-ing it,
the rest are irrelevant.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.760
-Just back out, back out.
-Do what?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.640
K is Kurupt FM.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.800
-We spell it with a K as well.
-Don't...

26:31.840 --> 26:33.800
Just get out.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.920
Spell it with a K? What's
that? It's like a three.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.920
He didn't use the thumb,
he just did that.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.360
I saw what he did, but he's...
Just get out. Come out the way.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.960
Come on. Hurry up, Decoy!

26:47.000 --> 26:50.240
Having a friend like Grindah,
it's always a good thing,

26:50.280 --> 26:52.680
cos you always want to have
hard men around you,
do you know what I mean?

26:52.720 --> 26:55.120
-We did it! We did it!
-We won.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.080
<i>We're all heavy boys...</i>

26:57.120 --> 27:01.760
and, you know, hanging around
with Grindah makes me hard.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.080
-Hi, hi, mate.
-Hey.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.280
-You all right?
-Yeah, you, you left your badge.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.400
-Sorry. Yeah, cheers, just...
-Cool.

27:22.760 --> 27:26.200
I was thinking I wanted to
get it all up on the walls, so
you can get a sense of it all.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.560
-Blinding.
-Yeah, great.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.280
-You gonna have an horse?
-A pony.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.920
Pony.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.240
You've been leaving
your van here overnight?

27:36.280 --> 27:39.560
Sorry, I'll move it. I'm just
really busy at the moment, so...

27:39.600 --> 27:45.120
Yeah, listen, erm... If you,
you know, need extra cash,

27:45.160 --> 27:48.280
I can sort you out some
extra hours. You know,
it shouldn't be a problem?

27:48.320 --> 27:51.440
-Is that all right, cos...
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.160
-Thank you so much, Sammy.
-It's just Sam.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.200
-Oh, thank you, Sam. Sorry.
-Yeah.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.160
-I killed it, innit?
-This is a music game,
know what I mean?

27:59.200 --> 28:01.120
-It's a game.
-Yeah.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.960
Don't play it if you're scared,
cos you'll only lose.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.560
-Yeah.
-So you never get scared then?

28:06.600 --> 28:09.200
I can't get scared,
you know what I mean?

28:09.240 --> 28:12.320
I come through the darkness and
man ain't scared of the dark.

28:12.360 --> 28:15.040
-Why? Cos I keep the door ajar.
-Cheese.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.560
Hoo-hoo! Kurupt FM-ing it,
the rest are irrelevant!

28:18.600 --> 28:23.360
This ain't for Kold FM.
This is Kurupt FM. Oi-oi!

28:23.400 --> 28:26.040
-[Robyn cries]
-Don't, don't shout, cos...

28:26.080 --> 28:27.160
Sorry, sorry.
