WEBVTT

00:01.950 --> 00:04.168
LUCCA:
As the judge said, we are here
merely for your convenience.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.869
Our fee is standard for
a bar attorney-- $135 per case.

00:05.910 --> 00:10.006
$85 an hour
if it goes more than one day.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.347
ALICIA:
I don't need a check.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.220
This slip is a CBR—-
cash bond refund. Sign it

00:13.270 --> 00:15.966
and your bail will be refunded
to me. That's how you pay me.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.090
It's up to you whether you want
to hire your own attorney.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.146
But just so you know, you'll
have to wait until after court.

00:21.190 --> 00:22.669
ALICIA:
And they might hold you
in lockup overnight.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.666
We need to post bond
in 45 minutes, or

00:24.720 --> 00:26.108
they'll transport you
to County for processing.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.971
Male, number 208.
Next up. Let's go.

00:29.020 --> 00:30.100
Yes, Your Honor.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.378
Uh, will you
take my 209?

00:35.120 --> 00:37.543
Male 209?
Yes, ma'am. Erik.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.329
Right, Erik. Uh,
are you married?

00:39.380 --> 00:41.985
Anyone who would be impacted
by your denial of bail?

00:42.040 --> 00:43.689
No. I have a dog, a pug.

00:43.730 --> 00:45.994
And how much money can you
post if the judge grants bail?

00:46.040 --> 00:48.031
Don't you want to know
ifI didN it first?
0.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.773
We just want to get you out
with the lowest possible bail.

00:49.830 --> 00:51.127
We don't need to argue
that you didn't do it.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.738
But I did.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.951
I did do it,
and I'd do it again.

00:55.010 --> 00:59.709
Okay, let's not share that
with anyone just yet, okay?

00:59.750 --> 01:01.741
JUDGE:
Male, number 209.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.097
That's us.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.833
State a proffer

01:04.890 --> 01:07.791
on allegations and any
aggravation for setting bond.

01:07.850 --> 01:11.229
MAN: Erik Barsetto, arrested for
vandalism, Your Honor. Went into

01:11.280 --> 01:12.804
the Chicago Museum
of Fine Arts yesterday

01:12.850 --> 01:14.021
and attacked a piece
of art with a hammer.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.106
Really?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.673
ALICIA: Mr. Barsetto has no
criminal record, Your Honor, and

01:17.720 --> 01:20.109
strong ties to the community.
Bail should be minimal.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.331
_ MAN:
He caused Irreparable damage,

01:21.380 --> 01:22.631
easily worth tens of
thousands of dollars.

01:22.690 --> 01:24.169
ALICIA: He broke
some glass, that's all.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.258
MAN: There's a videotape
of the attack, Your Honor.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.382
Leave to play it?It's a scuffed photo,
Prosecutor.

01:28.430 --> 01:30.216
I'm sure the defendant
won't do it again.

01:30.260 --> 01:33.218
Actually...Bail is set at $1,500.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.694
Male, number 210.It's gonna take
a few hours to process.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.731
I'll get the security video.It's me.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.179
Yes, I know, on the video.No.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.960
In the photo. The one
that I attacked-- it's me.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.928
I'm here to apologize.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.882
Okay.
I said some things.

01:51.930 --> 01:54.069
I was out of line,

01:54.110 --> 01:58.319
and I am asking
for your forgiveness.

01:58.370 --> 02:01.157
Apology accepted.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.808
But of course, uh...

02:05.860 --> 02:08.988
you know, the campaign--

02:09.040 --> 02:11.167
there's no place
for you now. I...I understand.

02:11.210 --> 02:15.214
I just didn't want to leave
things the way they were.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.825
Okay, I guess then that's it.

02:25.790 --> 02:28.258
That's it.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.794
Good-bye, sir.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.245
RUTH:
Eli?

02:47.900 --> 02:49.458
What do you need?

02:49.510 --> 02:51.068
Nothing.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.259
I've been meaning
to call you.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.643
About?
My candidate.

02:55.690 --> 02:58.215
You come near him again...

02:58.260 --> 03:01.696
I will destroy you
and everything you hold dear.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.083
[laughs]

03:04.140 --> 03:07.177
Ruth, have you seen
the movie It Follows?

03:08.490 --> 03:10.481
Can't say I have.

03:10.530 --> 03:13.408
Good? _
Modern CIaSSIC.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.798
Was there some point
to that?

03:16.840 --> 03:18.751
I just thought
you'd like it.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.711
RUTH:
Two-headed campaigns

03:20.760 --> 03:22.546
don't work, Mr. Governor.

03:22.590 --> 03:24.319
He just came to apologize.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.452
Respectfully, Governor,

03:26.510 --> 03:29.286
you could hear the gears
turning in his head.

03:29.330 --> 03:32.208
Where are we on polling, Ruth?

03:34.300 --> 03:38.646
[crowd chatter]

03:40.300 --> 03:44.122
[baby crying]

03:44.180 --> 03:46.307
[crowd chatter]

03:46.350 --> 03:48.910
Hey,

03:48.960 --> 03:50.222
do you know
any good investigators?

03:50.270 --> 03:52.044
Anyone who charges
by the hour?

03:52.100 --> 03:54.921
Not any good ones.

03:54.970 --> 03:56.699
Marty Pintarello's not bad

03:56.750 --> 04:00.311
if you get him in the
first half of the day.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.758
Jason Crouse.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.791
Oh, Amanda Marcassin.

04:03.850 --> 04:05.886
Thank you.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.840
MAN:
Group 200 to 210...Here we go.

04:07.890 --> 04:09.289
...coming out.
Showtime.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.321
[baby crying]

04:11.380 --> 04:14.201
Erik, when you said that photo
you attacked was of you...

04:14.250 --> 04:16.241
Have you seen it?

04:16.290 --> 04:20.420
Not yet.
"Vacation 2002."

04:20.470 --> 04:23.291
My mom took it of me
when I was eight.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.295
It's art? And why
did you attack it?

04:25.350 --> 04:27.306
I'm naked in it.

04:27.350 --> 04:31.650
It's, uh, from a cycle of photos
my mom took of my sister and I.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.429
Us at the beach.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.869
Us at a nudist camp.
They're, uh...

04:36.920 --> 04:41.448
She's selling them to the
Chicago Museum of Fine Arts

04:41.490 --> 04:44.232
for their permanent
collection.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.054
Uh, Erik, I have to get

04:46.110 --> 04:48.066
to my next client,
but I'm gonna look into this.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.328
[phone ringing]My guess is, the museum
won't want to press charges.

04:50.370 --> 04:53.237
They will if they
know I'll try again.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.326
Well, let's not
tell them that, okay?

04:55.380 --> 04:57.985
Hey, Cary.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.338
Thanks for getting back to me.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.859
How's life
in the bar attorney trenches?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.504
[laughs]
Same as there,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.721
only without the fees,
resources or muffins.

05:04.780 --> 05:07.248
Um, look, I'm chasing leads
on investigators.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.029
I need someone good but cheap.

05:09.090 --> 05:10.603
Hey, we're looking for one, too.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.254
You have anyone promising?

05:12.310 --> 05:14.653
You ever hear of
Marty Pintarello, Jason Crouse

05:14.700 --> 05:16.008
or Amanda Marcassin?

05:16.050 --> 05:17.563
No bells rung.

05:17.620 --> 05:21.351
Let me ask around.
I got to run.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.402
Hey. What's up?
MAN:
At the associates meeting,

05:23.450 --> 05:25.224
you told us to come to
you with any issues.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.362
Right, yeah.Well, we have one.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.186
Howard Lyman.
He was
the designated partner

05:30.240 --> 05:33.414
on the StarCross Insurance case,
but he didn't do anything.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.769
Look, I know it's a grind,

05:35.810 --> 05:37.630
but a lot of times,
you do the grunt work,

05:37.680 --> 05:39.375
and the partners swoop
in for the glory.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.591
He didn't swoop.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.289
He slept through
every meeting.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.296
The one time he bumped
into the client in the hallway,

05:44.340 --> 05:46.376
he called him David.
The guy's name is Stefan.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.852
Then he fudged the billing

05:47.910 --> 05:49.252
and claimed 70%
of the work as his own.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.688
All right, thank you
for bringing this to me.

05:50.740 --> 05:52.298
Let me get into it.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.829
About the other day...

05:56.870 --> 05:58.781
Forget it, non-issue.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.263
I want you to know I'm not gay.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.097
No worries. Seriously.
Excuse me.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.744
I have some leads
on Investigators.
Good.

06:04.790 --> 06:07.179
Who knew it'd be this
hard to find someone?

06:07.230 --> 06:09.403
Also, I need to call a meeting
of the name partners.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.759
On what subject?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.586
Howard.

06:13.630 --> 06:16.326
I do a lot of work
for the bar attorneys.

06:16.370 --> 06:19.760
I charge $75 an hour, and
you'll find you can't do better.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.278
I don't work weekends,
but I don't overcharge.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.729
And I'm good.

06:23.770 --> 06:25.374
And I understand
you're an ex-cop?

06:25.420 --> 06:27.422
No.
You're not?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.165
Uh-uh.

06:29.210 --> 06:32.031
Oh. Then I was mistaken.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.344
Uh, how much do you charge
by the hour?

06:34.390 --> 06:36.039
How much you got?

06:37.390 --> 06:39.176
How'd you do that?

06:39.220 --> 06:41.472
Killed a man.

06:41.530 --> 06:44.135
Ah. On the job?
No.

06:44.180 --> 06:46.432
Just in traffic.
He moved too slow.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.787
Do you have trouble
working weekends?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.444
Uh, not if you need it.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.276
How long have you been
an investigator, Amanda?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.311
Five years.
You seem young.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.055
Yeah, I go for that.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.623
People don't want to talk
to someone overbearing,

06:56.670 --> 06:57.580
so I keep it small, simple.

06:57.630 --> 06:59.325
I get results.

06:59.370 --> 07:00.712
From shoe leather,
beating the bushes.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.409
Having the contacts.

07:02.460 --> 07:04.325
Do you know Kalinda Sharma?

07:04.380 --> 07:05.449
No.

07:05.510 --> 07:06.807
You remind me of her.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.339
I hope that's a good thing.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.597
So, when can you start?

07:09.640 --> 07:10.857
Tomorrow, 9:00 am.

07:10.900 --> 07:14.859
Do you... have any questions
for me?

07:14.910 --> 07:17.128
Yeah. You have a dress code?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.775
What? No.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.253
Do a lot of people have
dress codes?

07:22.310 --> 07:23.823
No, I just like to ask.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.428
Makes it seem
like I'm not too easy.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.913
[laughs]

07:26.960 --> 07:29.428
You're not gonna tell me
how you did that, are you?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.526
Ice tray.

07:31.580 --> 07:34.094
One of those old metal ones.
Cut myself.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.448
20 stitches.

07:35.490 --> 07:36.707
Ow.
Yeah.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.921
I cried like a baby.
I don't like pain.

07:38.980 --> 07:39.878
When are you hiring?

07:39.930 --> 07:40.919
Immediately.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.322
I'll know in an hour.Oh, good.

07:42.370 --> 07:43.928
I hope this works out.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.414
Me, too.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.725
It was nice to meet you, Jason.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.987
You, too.

07:51.030 --> 07:52.588
Take care of that hand. Oh.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.198
[laughs]

07:57.780 --> 08:00.943
[clears her throat]

08:01.000 --> 08:02.604
I want him.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.642
He's more expensive.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.521
Than the cop?
The cop's terrible.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.913
No. Amanda.Well, how much more?

08:10.960 --> 08:13.008
Five dollars an hour.We can afford that.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.870
He's great. He's funny.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.524
It's not about

08:16.580 --> 08:18.536
being great or funny. It's...

08:18.580 --> 08:20.889
It's about who's better.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.625
He's better.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.626
Oh.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.628
[phone rings]JASON:
Jason Crouse.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.931
Jason, it's Alicia Florrick.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.845
Wow, that was fast.
What do you need?

08:30.900 --> 08:33.027
I just wanted to thank you
for coming in.

08:33.070 --> 08:34.890
But, um, I'm sorry.

08:34.940 --> 08:37.556
I think I'm going
in a different direction.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.728
Me, too. You seem like
you'd be a mean boss.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.463
[laughs]
Well, I would be.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.556
Um, but it was very nice
meeting you, Jason.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.693
Anytime.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.914
MAN:
Call us old-fashioned, but
we don't like it when people

08:50.960 --> 08:52.916
take hammers to our artwork.Given the subject matter--

08:52.960 --> 08:55.087
a naked photo of my client
at eight years old--

08:55.140 --> 08:57.267
I think you can understand
why Erik did it.

08:57.310 --> 08:59.187
And I'm sure you can understand
the bad publicity

08:59.230 --> 09:00.663
that would result
from a prosecution.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.484
All we're asking,
Mr. O'Neal, is that

09:02.540 --> 09:04.758
you drop the charges, and
we won't take this any...

09:04.800 --> 09:08.588
If you don't mind, uh, we'd like
our law firm to sit in on this.

09:08.630 --> 09:11.360
So sorry that I'm late,
but I made the mistake

09:11.420 --> 09:13.229
of passing
through the Wyeth exhibit.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.987
And, oh, my gosh,
it's beautiful. Hello.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.986
I know you, don't I?

09:19.030 --> 09:21.760
Yes, Nancy, we've been on
the opposite side of 12 cases.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.117
What is your name again?

09:23.170 --> 09:26.128
[laughs]
Alicia.

09:26.170 --> 09:29.128
Well, as I'm sure
Mr. O'Neal suggested,

09:29.170 --> 09:31.161
we are willing to
forgive and forget

09:31.220 --> 09:32.869
this horrible
vandalism...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.308
Of a naked photo of my client.

09:34.350 --> 09:35.658
Renowned piece of art.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.691
But we do want
something In return,

09:37.750 --> 09:39.786
and that is for your
client, Mr. Barsetto,

09:39.840 --> 09:41.489
to publicly embrace
his mother's exhibit.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.873
Excuse me?
We're also
gonna need you

09:43.930 --> 09:45.488
to pose for some
publicity photos

09:45.540 --> 09:47.053
next to the picture of yourself.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.658
Not a chance in hell.

09:48.710 --> 09:50.496
MAN:
Your mother's
photos are Important

09:50.540 --> 09:52.098
works of art, Erik.My mother's photos

09:52.150 --> 09:53.629
ruined my life.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.887
Let's not be
melodramatic.Oh, melodramatic?

09:55.940 --> 09:58.636
Anything I do, anywhere I go...

09:58.680 --> 10:01.114
IfI go on job interview, if
I go on a date-- they Google me,

10:01.160 --> 10:03.025
and you know the first thing
that comes up? A picture of me

10:03.080 --> 10:05.947
naked, so don't talk to be about
being melodramatic, please.

10:05.990 --> 10:08.333
You're in a work of art.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.813
I think a lot of people would

10:10.870 --> 10:13.088
love to be in
a work of art.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.650
Erik?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.260
Look, I'm really sorry
about blowing up back there.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.961
I know you said you could
get me probation, and I...

10:23.010 --> 10:24.352
Do you want to fight this?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.312
What do you mean?An emergency injunction

10:27.360 --> 10:29.089
against the museum
to stop the exhibition.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.879
They've already
put up the show.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.057
They'll be panicked
and want to compromise.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.532
What about the First Amendment?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.069
No.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.532
We go after consent.

10:37.590 --> 10:39.581
We prove that you never gave
your mother consent

10:39.630 --> 10:41.063
to take those photos.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.930
She can't sell them without it.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.458
We'll need to find your sister.Wendy?

10:45.510 --> 10:47.978
Um, I don't... I don't
know where she is.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.679
Amanda?
I'm on It.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.073
If she's gettable,
I'll get her.
Oh.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.168
And check Erik's
social media footprint.

10:54.210 --> 10:55.939
I don't want any surprises
in court.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.251
I got it.
Don't worry.[phone ringing]

10:57.300 --> 10:58.699
Think about it, Erik.

10:58.740 --> 10:59.991
Eli, can I call you back?

11:00.050 --> 11:01.472
No. I'll be quick.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.430
Peter has vetoed my being
your chief of staff,

11:03.480 --> 11:05.357
so I put together
a list of some people

11:05.400 --> 11:07.004
I think might be a good fit.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.132
What? When did he veto?Today.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.260
I'll do my best to find you
someone good, but

11:11.320 --> 11:12.878
I'm sure Ruth
will have some ideas.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.056
Okay, I get it.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.499
What?

11:15.540 --> 11:16.882
You're using me.

11:16.930 --> 11:19.239
What? No.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.271
I'll call you back, Eli.

11:27.070 --> 11:29.061
Thank you.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.980
So, how's the campaign going?

11:35.040 --> 11:38.908
Really good. We raised
$6 million in hard money

11:38.950 --> 11:41.293
and $11 million in soft.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.647
Good.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.691
How's the job?Good, too.

11:44.740 --> 11:47.868
It's like coming
right out of law school.Ah, freedom.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.002
The best thing that
can happen to anyone.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.917
Listen, um...

11:52.970 --> 11:55.131
Ruth wants to have a camera crew

11:55.190 --> 11:57.055
follow you in order
to play up the whole

11:57.100 --> 11:58.886
"helping the
common man" thing.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.057
Well, I don't know how much
I'm helping the common man

12:01.110 --> 12:02.714
in bond court, but...

12:02.760 --> 12:05.194
I'm sure she'll paint
a pretty picture.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.196
In fact, I want
to talk to you about...

12:07.240 --> 12:08.889
something.No.

12:08.940 --> 12:11.158
No what?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.804
No to Eli.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.859
Well, then we have a problem.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.335
Look”.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.073
I need Ruth.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.212
And Ruth won't stand for Eli.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.420
And you need me.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.256
And I won't stand without him.

12:27.310 --> 12:28.789
Oh, come on.No,

12:28.830 --> 12:31.526
Peter, you want to be Hillary's
vice president.

12:31.570 --> 12:35.176
The way to do that is by showing
you have a happy family.

12:35.230 --> 12:39.052
A family that overcame
your sexual indiscretions

12:39.100 --> 12:42.092
because your wife
forgave you

12:42.150 --> 12:45.278
and continues to forgive you.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.154
You're being used.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.758
I know.

12:52.810 --> 12:54.368
Who isn't?

12:59.690 --> 13:02.511
Okay.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.551
Eli's all yours.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.102
["Something So Wild"
by Bettie Serveert playing]

13:38.200 --> 13:40.077
GRACE:
What's that?

13:40.120 --> 13:43.169
She made it
through high school...

13:43.210 --> 13:44.336
A client.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.029
His mother took
these pIctures.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.036
Pictures of him?

13:48.080 --> 13:49.775
Of him
and his sister.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.162
Here.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.859
But a wave
of his hand's enough

13:53.920 --> 13:57.083
To get her back again...

13:58.530 --> 14:01.169
What do you think?

14:01.230 --> 14:04.131
I despise every word
that he speaks...

14:04.190 --> 14:07.182
How old are these kids?

14:07.230 --> 14:08.538
Eight and ten.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.888
Did the kids know that she was

14:09.930 --> 14:11.101
gonna put them in a book?

14:11.150 --> 14:13.971
I think so.
I... I don't know.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.931
That's weird.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.448
They're pretty.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.149
I guess that's the point.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.804
[knocking]

14:21.860 --> 14:25.978
But a wave
of his hand's enough...

14:27.120 --> 14:29.588
Hi.Hi.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.201
Do you need something?

14:32.260 --> 14:35.081
Yes. 50%
of the Erik Barsetto case.

14:35.130 --> 14:38.179
The...I handed him off to you
at bond court.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.563
Now that it's a money case...It's not a money case.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.909
Alicia, you can tell your client
it's about stopping the exhibit,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.655
but you know it's about milking
the museum for some cash.

14:49.270 --> 14:50.749
He's an embarrassment.DAVID:
I see Howard as more

14:50.800 --> 14:51.926
of an inconvenience.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.403
He's rude to
the clients.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.145
Well, he can
also be charming.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.100
In an
old-school way.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.198
Howard sleeps
half the day.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.753
Yet he's been
swallowing 70%

14:59.810 --> 15:01.107
of the associates'
billable hours.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.412
There is a mutiny
brewing below deck and

15:03.460 --> 15:05.985
we are gonna start losing good,
young associates because of him.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.113
Look, Howard's personal choices
leave something to be desired.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.980
But as far as who takes credit

15:11.040 --> 15:13.201
for what around here,
seniority rules.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.125
Cary, you take 70%
on cases.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.730
I do.
That's why we're here.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.953
But we do the work.No, we don't. We provide

15:20.000 --> 15:21.604
the clout.
The leadership.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.608
But these associates could
complaIn about any of us.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.049
So you need to think
about whether this is

15:27.100 --> 15:29.967
a professional problem
with Howard or a personal one.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.494
Mom.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.531
Erik.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.374
You don't have to...No, it's okay.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.298
You should have called me.

15:55.340 --> 15:58.298
I didn't think
this was about us.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.217
How could it not be?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.864
I'm not a kid anymore.

16:01.910 --> 16:03.343
I don't want them out there.

16:03.390 --> 16:04.994
I don't want people
gawking at them.

16:05.050 --> 16:06.392
They don't gawk.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.737
They do.
They look at them

16:07.790 --> 16:09.394
and they look at me.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.314
Why is this a problem now, Erik?

16:13.360 --> 16:14.782
The book has been
out for years.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.444
ERIK: _
Because It was startIng
to die down,

16:16.490 --> 16:18.139
and now
you're puttIng them

16:18.190 --> 16:20.886
in a museum _
and they're everywhere agaIn.

16:20.930 --> 16:24.627
I'm sorry, Erik,
but this is what I do.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.228
You know that.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.020
I-It's like a novel,
and you're asking

16:28.070 --> 16:30.538
a novelist to burn her book.No, it's not, Mom.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.673
I'm asking my mom
to listen to me, that's all.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.721
[sighs]

16:38.300 --> 16:40.939
I'm sorry, Erik.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.901
Let's go.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.042
ALICIA:
Erik, did your mother
ever ask you

16:49.090 --> 16:51.081
if you wanted to be
photographed?No.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.300
Did you ever tell your mother
that you didn't

16:52.350 --> 16:53.487
want to be photographed?

16:53.530 --> 16:55.873
Yes. Sometimes.So you didn't consent

16:55.920 --> 16:57.000
to these pictures?

17:00.710 --> 17:02.575
No.And without

17:02.630 --> 17:06.316
consent, the photographer
cannot sell them?CROZIER: Objection.

17:06.370 --> 17:08.326
I don't think that, uh,
Mrs. Florrick should be allowed

17:08.370 --> 17:09.496
to testify. She has
a witness for that.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.677
An innocent mistake, I am sure,

17:11.720 --> 17:12.971
Mrs. Florrick, wasn't it?

17:13.030 --> 17:14.372
Yes, Your Honor,
my apologies.

17:14.420 --> 17:17.116
No need.Thank you.
Nothing further.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.071
I don't know what's going on
with Judge Dunaway.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.168
He seems_ like
he's on medIcatIon.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.984
Maybe we can use it.Erik, did you like

17:23.040 --> 17:24.769
going to the dentist as a kid?

17:24.820 --> 17:26.469
Did I... What?

17:26.520 --> 17:28.738
Were you a whiner,
like I was? I remember

17:28.780 --> 17:32.079
my mom taking me just kicking
and screaming to the dentist.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.178
Were you the same
or did you just

17:34.220 --> 17:35.824
plop down in that chair
willingly?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.780
I guess I didn't want to go.

17:37.830 --> 17:39.172
Or the doctor--

17:39.230 --> 17:40.527
all those shots?

17:40.580 --> 17:42.138
Why did it seem like
there were

17:42.190 --> 17:44.351
so many shots?Objection. Relevance.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.355
DUNAWAY:
Have you ever read Catcher
in the Rye,Counselor?

17:46.410 --> 17:47.570
The kids
are told

17:47.630 --> 17:49.404
to yell, uh, "digression"

17:49.450 --> 17:51.623
when someone in the class
goes off-topIc.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.149
That's how
I feel

17:53.200 --> 17:54.929
about the7the_ relevance
objectIon.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.288
Let's... let's see
where thIngs go

17:56.330 --> 17:57.843
before we yell

17:57.900 --> 18:00.289
"digression."It's a beautiful story.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.466
I love Catcher in the Rye.

18:01.510 --> 18:02.898
Mr. Barsetto,

18:02.950 --> 18:04.429
you didn't give
your consent

18:04.470 --> 18:05.949
for the dentist or the doctor.

18:05.990 --> 18:08.072
Your mom gave consent
on your behalf,

18:08.130 --> 18:10.121
like all parents do
for their children.

18:10.170 --> 18:14.300
Likewise, your mom, who
nursed you, loved you,

18:14.350 --> 18:16.045
gave consent
on your behalf

18:16.090 --> 18:17.910
for taking the photos,
isn't that right?

18:19.660 --> 18:21.309
her copyright interest holds.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.396
She can use the photos
however she likes.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.133
Your Honor,
a parent's right to consent

18:25.190 --> 18:27.272
on a child's behalf
isn't absolute.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.926
Phyllis Barsetto couldn't have
consented to Erik's being raped

18:30.970 --> 18:32.926
or beaten,
for example.
CROZIER:
Raped

18:32.980 --> 18:34.538
or beaten? I mean, I guess

18:34.590 --> 18:36.490
we're in the world
of extreme examples.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.847
Yeah, if I wanted to deal
in rapes and assaults,

18:37.890 --> 18:39.289
I'd still be
in the criminal division.

18:39.330 --> 18:40.979
Let's just keep
this civil.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.634
Her point is: parental consent

18:42.680 --> 18:45.148
on behalf of a child ends
where harm begins.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.462
You're arguing that the
photographs themselves

18:47.510 --> 18:49.159
are harmful to your client?

18:49.210 --> 18:51.519
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor. That is why
I would like to introduce

18:51.560 --> 18:54.518
a photograph
into evidence.
CROZIER:
Objection.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.640
You don't want me
to see the photos?

18:55.690 --> 18:59.342
No, no.
I assume the
child is naked?

18:59.390 --> 19:01.130
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor, he is.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.341
Then I'll review the photos,
and for our purposes here,

19:03.400 --> 19:07.655
we'll, uh, cover the
sensitive parts. Sheriff?

19:14.500 --> 19:18.459
Yes, Ms. Eastman?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.809
What is It Follows?

19:22.940 --> 19:24.589
You smiled. Why did you smile?

19:24.640 --> 19:26.892
It's one of Mr.
Gold's favorites.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.545
Eli said I should see it.
Why should I see it?

19:29.600 --> 19:32.114
I don't know.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.070
It's about a girl who goes crazy

19:34.120 --> 19:37.385
'cause this thing, this being
constantly follows her.

19:37.430 --> 19:40.433
And if it catches her,
it'll kill her.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.859
So she can never feel safe.

19:46.350 --> 19:50.002
Nora, I need you
to do me a favor.

19:50.050 --> 19:53.440
Be Eli's assistant.

19:53.490 --> 19:56.050
Does he need an assistant?

19:56.100 --> 19:57.704
My guess is,
he misses you.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.490
Be his assistant

20:00.540 --> 20:03.452
and report back to me
on everything he does.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.849
ALICIA:
Erik, when was this photograph
first publicly exhibited?

20:10.900 --> 20:15.246
At a gallery when I was ten,
and a book later that year.And what,

20:15.300 --> 20:17.643
if any, impact did that
photograph have on your life?

20:17.690 --> 20:20.124
I got my ﬁrst e-mail
from a pedophile.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.421
CROZIER:
Objection, Your Honor.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.516
As to "a pedophile."

20:25.220 --> 20:28.121
Strike that.
ALICIA:
Go ahead, Erik.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.693
After the book was published,

20:29.750 --> 20:31.741
I'd come out of school,
and these men

20:31.790 --> 20:34.441
would be waiting
for me, and then

20:37.100 --> 20:39.660
And did your mother
know about this?
Yes.

20:39.710 --> 20:40.699
Did you talk about it?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.534
No.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.275
HOWARD:
I can sum up

20:44.330 --> 20:47.879
the Cubs' turnaround
In one word: Jews.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.329
You know,
all the great GMs are Jewish.

20:50.370 --> 20:52.634
So, Howard,
I was just checking in.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.853
Wanted to see how
things are going.
Yeah.

20:54.900 --> 20:58.199
Whatever is better than great
is how they're going.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.640
Billings are up,
my, uh, shingles are gone,

21:01.690 --> 21:03.601
and those new associates.

21:03.650 --> 21:07.290
Ooh. You seen the yabos
on that Mexican one?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.692
Huh? Teresa?

21:08.740 --> 21:09.866
She's American, Howard.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.299
[laughs]
Either way, ay, caramba.

21:13.350 --> 21:16.353
So, listen, Howard,

21:16.400 --> 21:19.051
I was chatting
with the senior partners.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.660
_And we think it would be
In everyone's best Interest

21:21.710 --> 21:23.268
if you shifted
to emeritus status.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.628
You'll still be
on the letterhead,

21:24.670 --> 21:25.830
you keep your offices.

21:25.890 --> 21:27.619
You come and go as you please,

21:27.670 --> 21:29.718
and, hey, it gives you
more time for golf.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.490
So, what do you think
about that, Howard?

21:32.550 --> 21:36.725
I think you try to move me out,
and I'll cut your balls off.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.631
Howard...
You think

21:40.690 --> 21:42.681
I'm bluffing,
you little gerbil, hmm?

21:42.730 --> 21:44.686
Check out a guy
named Ari Weir

21:44.730 --> 21:46.379
at the firm
I used to work for.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.821
Only don't stare
at his eye patch too long, okay?

21:50.870 --> 21:52.474
So, Erik, you say that this...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.602
this photo
destroyed your life, and

21:54.660 --> 21:57.527
not a day goes
you don't think about it?That's right.

21:57.570 --> 22:00.221
So, how do you explain,
then, these

22:00.270 --> 22:02.659
images taken from
your social media site?

22:02.710 --> 22:06.089
What the hell?CROZIER: It looks like you're
having a pretty good time.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.960
ERIK:
Well, I was out drinking
with college friends.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.796
And this one? I mean...
what is that, Hawaii?

22:11.850 --> 22:13.750
ALICIA:
You said there were

22:13.810 --> 22:15.493
no problems
on his Facebook page.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.972
AMANDA: And there weren't.
I don't know

22:17.030 --> 22:18.679
how they got these other photos.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.676
They Googled him. When
I say "Facebook," I don't just

22:20.730 --> 22:23.028
mean Facebook--
I mean the entire Internet.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.377
I'll make a note of that.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.374
Amanda,

22:25.430 --> 22:27.034
we got screwed in court.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.684
It won't happen again.

22:28.730 --> 22:31.733
Okay. Where are we
on the Wendy front?

22:31.780 --> 22:33.736
The sister? I...

22:33.780 --> 22:35.031
have a lead or two.

22:35.090 --> 22:36.864
Hey, should I be
billing you directly?

22:37.960 --> 22:39.211
Yes.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.999
CROZIER:
So Erik enjoyed

22:41.050 --> 22:42.392
the photo shoots?

22:42.440 --> 22:43.566
I thought he did.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.394
He was laughing.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.701
CROZIER: You didn't force him
to do anything?

22:46.750 --> 22:48.058
PHYLLIS [chuckles]:
No.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.704
The kids were just
running around.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.627
I'm a mom.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.626
Look, I know we live
in a culture

22:53.670 --> 22:58.198
saturated with porn and we're
all highly sensitive, but...

22:58.240 --> 23:00.549
I hate that that photo

23:00.590 --> 23:03.024
is covered up like it's dirty.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.503
It isn't dirty.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.814
The nudes of Michelangelo
are not dirty.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.328
The nudes of Edward
Weston are not dirty.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.779
But as soon as you

23:10.820 --> 23:12.947
slap brown paper on it,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.649
it's dirty.

23:14.690 --> 23:16.294
[sighs]

23:16.350 --> 23:20.343
My son is beautiful.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.652
My daughter is beautiful.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.748
And I won't give in to people

23:23.790 --> 23:27.430
who want to paint them
with a prurient brush.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.445
Thank you.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.616
LUCCA:
You say you gave

23:29.660 --> 23:31.924
your consent as
your children's mother?

23:31.970 --> 23:34.700
That's right.But previously...

23:34.760 --> 23:38.139
you said, "When I was with them,
behind the camera,

23:38.190 --> 23:39.976
"I was an artist,

23:40.020 --> 23:41.453
"not a parent.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.149
They were subjects,
not my children."

23:43.200 --> 23:44.679
I was making a point.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.768
States of mind.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.858
Mother, photographer.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.982
Even though you drew
that distinction?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.905
[sighs]

23:55.950 --> 23:58.737
I find this insulting.

23:58.780 --> 24:00.907
I'm hardly the first artist

24:00.960 --> 24:04.657
to use my children as subjects.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.827
Matisse, uh,
Lucian Freud,

24:06.880 --> 24:09.394
Newman,
Li Zhuangping.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.183
You'd never ask a male artist
to explaIn hImself lIke thIs.

24:13.230 --> 24:16.188
I would if he'd taken
nude pictures of his kids.

24:16.230 --> 24:19.017
ELI: Here's the plan
for the first two weeks.

24:19.060 --> 24:21.449
Whose plan?
Peter's?

24:21.500 --> 24:23.400
No. Yours.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.757
Your pathway
to rehabilitation.

24:24.810 --> 24:26.368
Do I really need it?

24:28.070 --> 24:31.198
_You were S_t. Alicia
untII your electIon scandal.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.593
Now people don't know
whatyou are.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.119
They want
to love you again,

24:35.160 --> 24:37.424
but they need to know
you're contrite.Oh, God.

24:37.470 --> 24:39.904
I hate going
through this again.Well, you don't have to.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.645
I do it for you.

24:41.690 --> 24:45.342
But I need you to talk
to someone you won't want to.

24:45.390 --> 24:47.699
Frank Landau,
Democratic Chair.Eli, he's the one

24:47.740 --> 24:50.527
who screwed me over.I know,
but you're gonna be

24:50.570 --> 24:51.912
a bigger man than him.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.655
You're going
to apologize to him.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.258
[phone rings]

24:57.140 --> 24:59.745
Alicia Florrick.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.279
I'll be right there.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.753
I have to go to court.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.848
Alicia, swallow
your pride now,

25:04.890 --> 25:06.755
and you will destroy him later.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.190
You apologize, and he
won't see you coming,
and I promise you,

25:10.240 --> 25:13.152
in four months' time,
you'll be kicking his teeth in.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.929
Drop the metaphors, Eli,
what do you mean?

25:14.990 --> 25:16.469
You'll be forcing him
out of his job,

25:16.510 --> 25:17.989
embarrassing him,

25:18.030 --> 25:21.420
making him come to you
to apologize.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.142
[whispers]:
He's a Muslim?

25:44.190 --> 25:46.408
That's news to me--
I thought he was Jewish.

25:46.450 --> 25:48.623
He converted last year
after a heart attack.

25:48.670 --> 25:50.979
DUNAWAY [panting]:
Sorry.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.578
Afternoon prayers.

25:52.630 --> 25:53.801
So, I've been

25:53.850 --> 25:56.284
giving this matter
a great deal of thought.

25:56.330 --> 25:58.025
Your Honor,
we're still trying

25:58.070 --> 26:01.028
to locate Mr. Barsetto's sister
for her testImony.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.765
CROZIER: We actually
found Wendy Barsetto,

26:03.820 --> 26:05.776
and _she tells
a very dIfferent story

26:05.820 --> 26:07.071
than her brother.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.519
We have this affidavit. Mm.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.642
This reinforces
my conclu5Ion

26:11.700 --> 26:16.603
that Mrs. Barsetto's consent is
and-and should be binding.

26:16.660 --> 26:18.651
She was well within
her parental rights

26:18.700 --> 26:21.043
to substitute her judgment
for that of her children.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.967
As a result, the preliminary
injunction is lifted,

26:24.010 --> 26:25.534
the museum may reopen
the exhibit immediately.

26:25.580 --> 26:27.571
ALICIA: Your Honor...Mrs. Florrick,

26:27.620 --> 26:28.928
my decision is final.LUCCA:
Actually,

26:28.970 --> 26:30.403
we understand that,
Your Honor.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.883
We have another matter.

26:31.930 --> 26:33.750
We request a separate ruling

26:33.800 --> 26:36.678
on the right of publicity.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.029
Excuse me?Consent gets them
the right to show

26:39.070 --> 26:40.981
the artwork, but that
doesn't mean they can use

26:41.030 --> 26:43.339
the images of Erik for
commercial purposes.

26:43.380 --> 26:46.338
Our client has his own
right of publicity--
which means nothing

26:46.380 --> 26:49.770
in the gift shop can have
Erik's image on it.

26:49.820 --> 26:51.640
No backpacks,
mouse pads,

26:51.690 --> 26:53.646
key chains...
O'NEAL:
We don't make a profit

26:53.690 --> 26:55.829
unless we have the
gift shop revenue.DUNAWAY: Okay.

26:55.870 --> 26:58.600
You are correct on the law,

26:58.660 --> 27:02.744
so we will go over each item
one at a time, and, uh,

27:02.790 --> 27:04.701
I will rule on each one.
Thank you.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.741
[quietly]:
Nice save.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.792
I have my moments.

27:15.890 --> 27:18.142
To what do I owe the pleasure?

27:18.200 --> 27:22.455
I'm here to apologize,
Mr. Landau.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.637
I'm sorry I made a stink

27:24.680 --> 27:27.501
about the party withdrawing
its support for my campaign.

27:27.550 --> 27:28.767
I understand
it had to happen.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.503
Well, you're new to this,
Alicia.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.811
There's a learning curve--
we've all

27:31.860 --> 27:33.464
had to scale it.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.774
I accept
your apology.Thank you, sir.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.697
ELI: We'd like to put this
all behind us, Frank,

27:38.740 --> 27:40.082
for Alicia's sake _
as much as Peter's campaIgn.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.779
I think that's wise.We're hoping you'll

27:41.830 --> 27:44.390
consider putting out
a letter of support for Alicia

27:44.440 --> 27:46.692
clearing her of any wrongdoing
in the election scandal.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.832
I can do you one better.

27:51.140 --> 27:55.019
Alicia, how would you like a
post on the election board?

27:55.060 --> 27:58.279
Nothing will show we
believe you're innocent

27:58.320 --> 28:01.676
more than a seat on the board
that found you guilty.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.359
[soft chuckle]
Well, thank you, Frank.

28:04.420 --> 28:07.059
This-this means a lot.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.725
Alicia?Actually, Eli, can you
give us a minute?

28:09.770 --> 28:12.898
Oh, anything you say to Alicia,
you can say in front of me.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.815
We'll be right out.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.731
[door opens]

28:24.790 --> 28:26.826
[door closes]Yes?

28:26.870 --> 28:28.826
The first vote
on the election board,

28:28.880 --> 28:30.529
I need you to vote "no."

28:30.570 --> 28:32.743
Why?

28:32.790 --> 28:34.610
Because I'm asking you.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.662
Well, what's the vote?

28:36.710 --> 28:37.790
Doesn't matter.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.445
I need you to vote "no."

28:50.640 --> 28:52.801
I'm working for you now.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.203
You are? Why is that?

28:55.250 --> 28:57.810
I don't like working
for Ms. Eastman.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.816
Okay.

28:59.860 --> 29:02.203
[door closes]

29:02.260 --> 29:04.728
What'd he say?

29:04.780 --> 29:06.088
I'm on the board.

29:06.130 --> 29:07.643
That's it?

29:07.700 --> 29:09.122
Come on, what'd he really say?

29:10.740 --> 29:11.957
Nothing.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.279
I don't know what happened.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.355
I had a lead on her.

29:22.410 --> 29:23.365
Wendy was living
in Chicago.

29:23.410 --> 29:24.889
All they did
was look online.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.238
That's not all they did.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.010
Look, if you want
to fire me, fire me.

29:29.070 --> 29:30.799
_ But I_ am the best
InvestIgator In town.

29:30.850 --> 29:32.101
You're fired.

29:34.770 --> 29:35.930
I put my heart and soul
into this place.

29:35.990 --> 29:37.946
Fired. I don't need you.

29:37.990 --> 29:40.026
Go to hell.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.298
Yes, Mr. Crouse.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.251
It's Alicia Florrick,
do you remember me?

29:44.300 --> 29:45.779
Oh, I remember you.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.299
Backup singer in Prince's band?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.386
[chuckles]
Right.

29:49.430 --> 29:51.170
I was wondering if you were
available for work.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.733
Can I call you back?

29:52.790 --> 29:54.735
Sure.

29:54.790 --> 29:57.827
You have a very impressive
rsum, Mr. Crouse.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.007
Well, I'm a very
impressive person.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.962
Would you give me a second?

30:04.010 --> 30:05.796
I just got a call
from Judge Terzzi's clerk.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.705
The Van Persie trial
we're not supposed to start

30:07.760 --> 30:08.704
until next month.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.920
Right.
He moved it up.

30:09.980 --> 30:10.924
To Monday.

30:10.980 --> 30:12.106
He... Why?

30:12.150 --> 30:13.105
I don't know.

30:13.150 --> 30:14.845
Someone talked to him.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.855
The hell are you doing?

30:19.900 --> 30:22.368
Well, I was about
to squeeze lemon juice

30:22.420 --> 30:24.593
on Susan Sarandon's bare torso.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.982
You called Judge Terzzi, huh?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.553
Got my case moved
up four weeks?

30:27.600 --> 30:28.817
Nico and I are old friends.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.599
Had a few beers,
I asked him to expedite...

30:30.650 --> 30:32.299
Yeah, yeah, expedite it.

30:32.350 --> 30:33.863
We're not even close
to bang ready.

30:33.910 --> 30:35.912
Then get on your horse, Cary.You push back

30:35.960 --> 30:37.825
on the emeritus thing
by screwing over a client?

30:37.870 --> 30:39.428
Clients don't like to wait
for their day in court.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.913
They get a
little antsy.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.349
This is how we play
in the big leagues, buddy.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.924
You don't want to fight me,
Howard.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.837
Actually I do.

30:52.060 --> 30:55.405
All right, let's go. Sit down.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.758
You may commence petty
fighting over tchotchkes.

30:57.810 --> 30:59.766
Uh, these are all items
that will be sold

30:59.810 --> 31:01.414
in the museum store, Your Honor,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.769
most of them commercial,
with no artistic value.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.209
Like this mouse pad,
for example.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.763
CROZIER:
Your Honor, I've

31:06.820 --> 31:08.902
often found mouse pads
to be works of art.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.293
They're tiny
canvases...Save it. They're out.

31:11.340 --> 31:13.865
Though I doubt the museum's
gonna lose a lot of money there.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.252
What's next?The exhibit catalogue.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.439
No, books are not technically
items of commerce.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.914
It's more like a magazine.Books and magazines
are in. Next.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.042
Uh, T-shirts.
Oh.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.170
Big ticket item.

31:23.220 --> 31:25.131
Are you saying
that fashion is not art?

31:25.180 --> 31:26.704
This isn't fashion. It's
sold in a souvenir store.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.138
The Supreme Court

31:28.190 --> 31:30.579
found T-shirts to be protected
expressive works.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.702
Um, the fine arts exception
to the right of publicity

31:32.760 --> 31:34.660
doesn't apply if the item
is used as advertisement.

31:34.710 --> 31:35.927
Well, what is that T-shirt
advertising?

31:35.980 --> 31:37.925
The museum.
T-shirts with

31:37.980 --> 31:40.881
the name of the museum are out,
T-shirts with images are in.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.545
Everybody wins. Next.

31:43.590 --> 31:46.889
Your Honor, I think
that we can skip "next,"

31:46.940 --> 31:50.899
ifI may just recall
Erik Barsetto to the stand.

31:50.950 --> 31:54.511
Mr. Barsetto, this photo--
where was it taken?

31:54.560 --> 31:56.551
Kennebago Lake.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.953
Thank you. That's all.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.049
Judge, I don't
see the relevance.
No,

32:02.090 --> 32:04.342
but I feel it coming.Kennebago Lake

32:04.400 --> 32:07.654
is in Maine, which does not
recognize a right of publicity.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.964
DUNAWAY:
How many of these photos
of you were taken in Maine?

32:10.010 --> 32:12.183
All of them.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.484
Well, that makes my job easier.

32:15.540 --> 32:18.145
Maine law controls,
the museum can sell it all.

32:18.190 --> 32:19.885
Even the mouse pads.

32:19.930 --> 32:21.932
LUCCA:
But, Your Honor,
you just said they were out.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.016
You heard me: it's all in!

32:25.070 --> 32:27.026
What the hell
was that about?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.243
I have no idea.
What did we do?

32:29.290 --> 32:31.246
JASON:
It's not you.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.281
He's hungry.
What do you mean?

32:33.340 --> 32:35.979
Ramadan. He's been
fasting all day.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.462
So what do we do?

32:37.520 --> 32:40.250
Catch him in the morning.
He'll have more patience.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.995
Thank you.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.691
I'm sorry I didn't
hire you immediately.

32:44.740 --> 32:47.527
Hey, I'm a big believer
in second chances.

32:47.570 --> 32:49.128
What are you gonna do here?

32:49.180 --> 32:51.045
No idea.

32:51.090 --> 32:53.741
The exhibit's about to open,
and we're out of witnesses.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.655
I might have someone.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.493
Mr. Wilson, do you consider
these images to be

33:05.540 --> 33:07.098
child pornography?
CROZIER:
Objection.

33:07.150 --> 33:09.971
Your Honor, this man's opinion
is not relevant.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.988
Your Honor, Mr. Wilson
is an expert in the ﬁeld.

33:13.030 --> 33:14.190
In what way?Mr. Wilson,
were you

33:14.250 --> 33:16.502
convicted
of possessing child pornography?

33:16.550 --> 33:18.859
Yes.And were you a member
of online communities

33:18.900 --> 33:22.813
where you...
advised other people

33:22.870 --> 33:25.031
how...Yeah, I-I get the picture.
Ms. Crozier,

33:25.090 --> 33:26.159
your objection
is overruled.

33:26.220 --> 33:28.176
Illinois Evidentiary
Rule 702.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.302
He's an...
expert.

33:30.350 --> 33:33.342
ALICIA: Mr. Wilson, are you
familiar with these photos?Absolutely.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.822
My online friends and I

33:34.880 --> 33:36.177
have traded them back and forth
for years.

33:36.230 --> 33:37.447
For what purpose?

33:37.490 --> 33:41.312
Personal sexual gratification.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.011
ALICIA:
And, to your mind,
are they distinctive

33:44.060 --> 33:47.143
from the photos you were
convicted of possessing?No.

33:47.190 --> 33:50.011
Same thing, only... better.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.026
Your Honor,
we submit that these photos

33:52.070 --> 33:54.152
are essentially
child pornography, and, as such,

33:54.200 --> 33:57.067
consent doesn't matter, nor
does any fine arts exception--

33:57.120 --> 33:59.076
they cannot
be displayed.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.078
This is a smear campaign.
Phyllis BarsettoThis is not a smear campaign.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.724
is a well-respected
artist.This is about child porno...

34:03.780 --> 34:05.998
[stomach growling loudly]

34:12.130 --> 34:14.951
No further questions.No further questions.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.649
[growling continues]

34:16.700 --> 34:18.656
You really see no difference

34:18.700 --> 34:21.089
between, uh, child pornography

34:21.140 --> 34:22.095
and Ms. Barsetto's work?

34:22.140 --> 34:24.096
Well, they're artsier.

34:24.140 --> 34:27.667
But I still... use them.

34:27.710 --> 34:31.669
I'm from Michigan, so this is
all just a little much for me.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.142
[stomach growling]

34:35.550 --> 34:38.769
Wh-What else do you use, sir,

34:38.810 --> 34:41.677
for-for the purposes
of your self-gratification?

34:41.730 --> 34:45.075
Um, anything
from a normal bookshop?Well, I don't really know

34:45.120 --> 34:47.680
what's in a normal bookshop
these days.

34:47.730 --> 34:50.198
I've been in prison
for the last 11 years.

34:50.260 --> 34:52.342
How about Lolita?

34:52.390 --> 34:54.608
No.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.789
[stomach
growling]

35:00.180 --> 35:02.432
Gap Kids?

35:02.490 --> 35:04.879
DIANE:
Simply donating

35:04.920 --> 35:07.093
to pro-choice candidates
isn't enough anymore.

35:07.140 --> 35:09.096
We need to think
much bigger.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.141
Is that your polite way
of saying we should launch

35:11.190 --> 35:14.182
a super PAC, Diane?Well, it's a much more
flexible structure.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.196
HOWARD:
Good afternoon, ladies.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.889
Howard.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.283
Howard Lyman. And may I say
how honored we are

35:20.330 --> 35:24.152
to be having this meeting with
the leadership of Emily's World?

35:24.200 --> 35:26.156
Emily's List.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.110
Of course. So, Diane,

35:28.160 --> 35:30.299
are we gonna help
these ladies kick

35:30.340 --> 35:32.160
some pro-lifer butt in 2016?

35:32.210 --> 35:34.678
Uh, Howard,
may I have a moment?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.957
[quietly]:
Cary tried to keep me
out of this meeting.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.956
I will not be sidelined.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.171
Cary's not involved
with this group.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.130
Don't enable him, Diane.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.829
And may I say, ladies,

35:49.880 --> 35:53.145
I think abortion is great.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.975
You told Howard not _to attend
my meetIng WIth EmIIy's LIst,

35:58.020 --> 36:00.272
knowing he'd show up and
make a fool of himself.

36:00.330 --> 36:02.628
No. I told him
not to show up.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.409
You two have to quit this.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.451
Now!

36:08.380 --> 36:10.723
And set up a call
with Abe Ehrling at The Ledger.

36:10.770 --> 36:12.419
We need to do a story
on Alicia

36:12.470 --> 36:14.813
starting her own firm,
working as a bar attorney.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.725
"Defender of the Underdog"
sort of thing.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.385
Nice try, Eli, but no.

36:19.430 --> 36:21.512
You know voters hate
defense lawyers.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.344
They keep the bad
guys out of jail.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.346
I won't let you
sabotage the campaign.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.652
What do you want me to do?I control the message.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.429
Every article,
every interview
goes through me.

36:29.490 --> 36:31.833
And you're
on probation.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.759
Eli.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.848
I'm supposed to keep tabs on you

36:40.890 --> 36:42.323
for Ms. Eastman.

36:42.370 --> 36:44.588
Tell her everything
you're doing.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.285
[whispers]:
Really?

36:54.160 --> 36:56.378
PHYLLIS:
Titian's Venus of Urbino.

36:56.430 --> 36:59.775
It's_cons_idered the most
erotIc paIntIng of all tIme.

36:59.820 --> 37:02.254
Look at the eye contact
she makes with the viewer.

37:02.300 --> 37:03.949
CROZIER: And it hangs
in the Uffizi.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.434
No one would claim
this wasn't art.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.301
That's correct.But it is
an adult woman,

37:09.350 --> 37:10.999
and your work depicts children.

37:11.050 --> 37:13.268
The history of art is
littered with depictions

37:13.310 --> 37:15.130
of nude children.

37:15.180 --> 37:17.876
Angels, Greek gods,

37:17.930 --> 37:21.354
Botticelli and most of
the Renaissance artists...

37:21.410 --> 37:25.232
In Veronese's painting,
the naked infant Jesus

37:25.280 --> 37:27.328
is even cradling his penis.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.498
[stomach grumbling loudly]

37:30.550 --> 37:31.892
[sighs]

37:31.940 --> 37:34.374
You say that your work
has more in common

37:34.420 --> 37:37.287
with these paintings
than with pornography?

37:37.340 --> 37:38.819
Yes.

37:38.860 --> 37:41.169
I'm sorry, Erik,

37:41.210 --> 37:43.383
if they caused you pain,
but they're not pornography.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.773
ALICIA:
Your Honor, something
is or isn't pornographic

37:45.820 --> 37:47.344
on its face.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.120
720 ILCS 5/11-20, 1 says...

37:50.180 --> 37:51.738
That's a criminal statute.

37:51.790 --> 37:54.008
Have criminal charges
been filed?

37:54.050 --> 37:55.301
That's a good question.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.089
Uh, have-have they?

37:57.140 --> 37:58.357
No, Your Honor.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.619
Young man, are you
intending to go down

38:01.670 --> 38:03.274
to the State's Attorney's
Office and swear out

38:03.320 --> 38:05.140
a criminal complaint
against your mother?

38:07.370 --> 38:09.099
Okay, then.

38:09.150 --> 38:11.106
We have a ruling.
This court isn't gonna find

38:11.150 --> 38:13.755
that Mrs. Barsetto's photos
are child pornography.

38:13.810 --> 38:15.152
The injunction
expires instanter.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.543
The exhibit reopens tomorrow
as planned. Whew!

38:26.040 --> 38:30.864
I've got another offer.May I ask from whom?

38:30.910 --> 38:33.561
No. But they want me
to be exclusive,

38:33.610 --> 38:35.658
which would mean
no freelancmg for you.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.305
Are you leveraging me to get
a better deal from them?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.487
Iam.

38:41.010 --> 38:43.524
I don't have any wiggle room,
Mr. Crouse.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.445
What are they offering you?

38:45.490 --> 38:46.878
More.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.180
[mouthing]

38:50.760 --> 38:53.718
Okay. I'm stretching here,

38:53.760 --> 38:56.718
but final-final: $85 an hour.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.069
Wow. That will put me
in the bottom third

38:59.110 --> 39:00.509
of the RI. scale.

39:00.550 --> 39:02.245
Take a chance.

39:02.290 --> 39:03.632
Might be fun.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.636
Let me think about it.

39:05.690 --> 39:08.773
See if you can up
the other offer?

39:08.820 --> 39:10.299
Yeah.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.729
I'll call you.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.510
GRACE: I don't get it.
Was that a yes or a no?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.253
It wasn't a yes.

39:17.310 --> 39:19.210
Okay, well, let's turn to me.

39:19.260 --> 39:20.397
Okay.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.260
I'd like to renegotiate
my salary.

39:22.310 --> 39:23.561
[laughs]

39:23.620 --> 39:26.043
You don't have a salary.I know.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.318
Which is why I'd like
to negotiate it.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.706
DIANE:
You two need to make peace.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.183
Or at the very least,
stop making war.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.060
We are not leaving this room

39:37.110 --> 39:39.670
until we figure out a way
to put aside the differences

39:39.720 --> 39:41.585
and work together.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.846
Okay.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.027
Fine with me.
Absolutely not.

39:45.070 --> 39:48.722
He sat me down at lunch and
told me I was worthless.

39:48.770 --> 39:50.021
I'm sure he didn't say that.Diane,

39:50.080 --> 39:51.638
there's no common ground, okay?

39:51.690 --> 39:53.590
It's either him or me.

39:53.650 --> 39:54.867
Cary goes

39:54.910 --> 39:56.559
or I do.

39:56.610 --> 39:57.827
[door opens]

39:57.870 --> 39:59.599
[door closes]Did he just issue

39:59.650 --> 40:02.699
the easiest ultimatum
In hIstory?

40:07.490 --> 40:09.526
Mr. Crouse, how are you?

40:09.580 --> 40:11.093
Good. Thank you, ma'am.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.222
So, I've got a counteroffer.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.225
And you're wondering
if I'll beat it.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.748
Yeah. It's $200 an hour.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.273
Okay. $250.

40:21.330 --> 40:24.060
But that's it.
You need_to work
exclu5Ively,

40:24.110 --> 40:27.068
and, uh, I need an answer now.

40:28.730 --> 40:29.719
Phyllis,

40:29.770 --> 40:31.328
you testified in court

40:31.380 --> 40:33.336
about how much Erik
loved what he did,

40:33.380 --> 40:34.938
how much he helped you--
after school,

40:34.990 --> 40:36.514
on weekends, vacations.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.778
Some kids play sports

40:38.820 --> 40:39.866
or get a job.

40:39.910 --> 40:41.252
But Erik didn't
need a job.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.860
He already had one--
as your model.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.253
He enjoyed it.You don't need...

40:46.310 --> 40:47.732
There were no work papers filed,

40:47.790 --> 40:48.745
and our client_
wasn't paId anythIng.

40:48.790 --> 40:51.702
You're going after child labor?

40:51.750 --> 40:54.355
Seriously?ALICIA: Erik worked
four hours a day,

40:54.400 --> 40:56.049
five days a week per photo.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.091
That's over
200 photos.

40:58.150 --> 41:00.368
Throw in compounded
interest,

41:00.410 --> 41:03.584
double it all
in liquidated damages...ERIK: Mom,

41:03.630 --> 41:05.404
we could've skipped all this.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.587
We still could skip it

41:07.630 --> 41:10.246
if you'll just
give me the photos.

41:11.550 --> 41:12.801
Erik...

41:12.860 --> 41:15.078
the photos are on the Internet.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.680
You'll never truly
get back what you lost.

41:17.730 --> 41:19.425
But this money,
it can help you

41:19.470 --> 41:21.688
start the next
part of your lIfe.

41:25.610 --> 41:28.829
["World Spins Madly On"

41:36.580 --> 41:37.649
PETER:
Ruth.

41:37.710 --> 41:39.189
Oh, Governor.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.755
I just got a call
from Frank Landau.Yes.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.188
Eli went rogue.

41:43.230 --> 41:44.788
His assistant just told me.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.624
Landau's supporting Alicia.

41:47.890 --> 41:49.710
No, I d... I don't think so.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.670
Yes, he is.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.711
He said that Eli arranged it.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.112
[chuckles softly]

41:55.640 --> 41:58.279
Mr. Governor, I'm...I think it's

41:58.340 --> 42:00.854
rather good work on Eli's part,
don't you think?

42:00.900 --> 42:03.425
I do think.

42:03.470 --> 42:05.813
Good. Give him a call
and tell him that.

42:05.870 --> 42:08.771
I don't want any bad blood.
When he does well, I want you

42:08.830 --> 42:10.559
to congratulate him;
when you do well,

42:10.610 --> 42:12.305
I want him to congratulate you.

42:12.350 --> 42:14.784
Give him a call.

42:14.830 --> 42:16.138
Willingly.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.829
Good.

42:21.360 --> 42:25.353
$32,000. That's not bad
for a week's worth.

42:25.410 --> 42:28.880
$16,000. I split it
fifty-fifty with Lucca.

42:28.930 --> 42:31.103
So let's see,
$400 to Amanda,

42:31.150 --> 42:33.106
$160 to Jason,

42:33.150 --> 42:35.892
$80... to me.

42:35.940 --> 42:37.896
[doorbell rings]I'll get that.

42:37.940 --> 42:39.635
Might be a new client.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.329
I will get it.

42:41.380 --> 42:43.371
And take the time for you...

42:43.430 --> 42:45.159
Hey.

42:45.210 --> 42:46.768
Hey.

42:46.820 --> 42:48.128
So...

42:48.170 --> 42:49.649
are we negotiating?

42:49.690 --> 42:52.215
That depends.

42:52.260 --> 42:54.911
What do I have to beat now?

42:56.050 --> 42:58.951
$90 an hour.
No exclusivity.

42:59.010 --> 42:59.954
And the world...

43:00.010 --> 43:02.786
$95 an hour, but that's it.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.831
No more using me
as a stalking horse.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.529
Take it or leave it.

43:06.580 --> 43:08.832
Take it.
