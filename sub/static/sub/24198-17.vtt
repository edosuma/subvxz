WEBVTT

00:08.477 --> 00:12.577
>>> WELCOME TO THE JIM JEFFERIES
SHOW.

00:12.578 --> 00:15.706
3D PRINTERS CAN NOW PRINT
WORKING GUNS.

00:15.707 --> 00:20.004
LUCKILY THEY CAN ALSO PRINT GOOD GUYS TO SHOOT
THEM SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

00:20.007 --> 00:26.275
THEN WE TALK ABOUT SECURITY AND THE
WEIRD THINGS WE DO TO FEEL SAFE.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.647
FOR INSTANCE, MY SON'S BLURT
BLANKET.

00:27.648 --> 00:29.547
IT HAS NO REAL PROTECTIVE
POWERS.

00:29.548 --> 00:31.807
BUT I STILL CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT
IT.

00:31.808 --> 00:34.447
AND I SIT DOWN WITH
CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE.

00:34.448 --> 00:41.377
THAT'S ALL COMING UP.
LET'S GET THIS SHOW STARTED.

00:42.007 --> 00:48.206
*

00:48.207 --> 00:51.177
ON

00:59.407 --> 00:59.677
.

00:59.678 --> 01:01.747
>>> WELCOME TO "THE JIM
JEFFERIES SHOW."

01:01.748 --> 01:03.246
I'M JIM JEFFERIES.

01:03.247 --> 01:06.645
GREAT NEWS! GETTING A GUN
JUST GOT EVEN EASIER.

01:06.648 --> 01:09.876
>> THERE'S A NEW FRONT IN THE
FIGHT OVER GUN CONTROL.

01:09.877 --> 01:13.406
PEOPLE MAKING GUNS AT HOME WITH
3D PRECIPITATIONERS.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.376
THEY DON'T HAVE SERIAL NUMBERS,
THEY DON'T REQUIRE A BACKGROUND

01:17.377 --> 01:19.807
CHECK, AND THEY CAN SLIP THROUGH
METAL DETECTORS.

01:19.808 --> 01:22.906
>> SO AMERICANS HAVE A HUGE
PROBLEM WITH UNDOCUMENTED

01:22.907 --> 01:25.606
PEOPLE, BUT UNDOCUMENTED GUNS
ARE JUST FINE.

01:25.607 --> 01:31.245
I GUESS IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET THE GUN OFF
THE STREET WE SHOULD CALL THEM MEXI-GUNS.

01:36.407 --> 01:38.707
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS A
MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ANYONE

01:38.708 --> 01:40.746
COULD DOWNLOAD AND PRINT A GUN.

01:40.747 --> 01:43.307
WE'VE BEEN HEADED THIS WAY FOR A
WHILE.

01:43.308 --> 01:45.946
>> IN 2013, A GUN RIGHTS

01:45.947 --> 01:48.346
ENTHUSIAST AND SELF-DESCRIBED

01:48.347 --> 01:50.176
ANARCHIST NAMED CODY WILSON

01:50.177 --> 01:52.476
POSTED ONLINE THE DESIGNS FOR A

01:52.477 --> 01:53.846
3D PRINTED FUNCTIONAL PLASTIC

01:53.847 --> 01:54.647
HAND GUN.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.776
>> A SELF

01:55.777 --> 01:56.747
YOU DON'T SAY?

02:00.147 --> 02:02.006
DON'T ALL ANARCHISTS HAVE TO BE

02:02.007 --> 02:03.306
GUN NUTS?

02:03.307 --> 02:04.546
IF THEY'RE IN TROUBLE WHAT ARE

02:04.547 --> 02:07.106
THEY GOING TO DO, CALL THE COPS?

02:07.107 --> 02:07.807
HELLO, GOVERNMENT AGENCY I DON'T

02:07.808 --> 02:09.545
BELIEVE IN, COME QUICKLY,

02:09.547 --> 02:10.306
SOMEONE BROKE A LAW THAT I DON'T

02:10.308 --> 02:11.577
ACKNOWLEDGE!

02:14.907 --> 02:16.106
WILSON CLAIMS DISTRIBUTING THE

02:16.107 --> 02:18.346
PLANS IS LEGAL BECAUSE HE'S

02:18.347 --> 02:19.446
SIMPLY EXERCISING HIS FIRST

02:19.447 --> 02:20.676
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO SHARE

02:20.677 --> 02:21.377
INFORMATION.

02:21.378 --> 02:24.446
YEAH, IT'S JUST INFORMING THE

02:24.447 --> 02:24.847
PUBLIC.

02:24.848 --> 02:26.246
THAT'S THE WAY EVERY SHOOTING

02:26.247 --> 02:28.446
VICTIM FEELS WHEN THEY GOT SHOT.

02:28.447 --> 02:29.177
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION, I

02:29.178 --> 02:32.107
FEEL SO EDUCATED.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.376
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY

02:34.377 --> 02:35.347
SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPEN IN SCHOOL,

02:35.347 --> 02:36.207
IT'S JUST THE LATEST WAY FOR THE

02:36.208 --> 02:38.846
KIDS TO LEARN.

02:38.847 --> 02:42.806
KIDS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THOSE

02:42.807 --> 02:43.677
WISDOM BULLETS WHIZZING PAST

02:43.678 --> 02:45.146
THEIR HEADS!

02:45.147 --> 02:46.446
HEY, SON, HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

02:46.447 --> 02:48.306
OH, DAD, WE LEARNED SO MUCH!

02:48.307 --> 02:50.546
LIKE IF A BULLET LEAVES A GUN

02:50.547 --> 02:52.506
TRAVELING 2,000 FEET PER SECOND

02:52.507 --> 02:54.606
AND JERRY FORGETS TO DUCK, HOW

02:54.607 --> 02:56.747
MANY DAYS DO WE GET OFF SCHOOL?

03:02.407 --> 03:03.107
DAD, DAD, WHY DO MY HANDS

03:03.108 --> 03:08.476
CONSTANTLY SHAKE?

03:08.477 --> 03:09.606
WILSON DOES HAVE A POINT, IT'S

03:09.607 --> 03:12.446
NOT ILLEGAL TO SHARE

03:12.447 --> 03:12.877
INFORMATION.

03:12.877 --> 03:13.577
AND IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO MAKE

03:13.577 --> 03:14.277
YOUR OWN GUN.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.206
>> YES, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LEGAL

03:16.207 --> 03:17.246
TO MAKE YOUR OWN GUN.

03:17.247 --> 03:18.376
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

03:18.377 --> 03:19.446
LITERALLY ALL THE THINGS THESE

03:19.447 --> 03:21.576
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WERE

03:21.577 --> 03:23.106
ALREADY LEGAL, WE'RE JUST

03:23.107 --> 03:25.106
PROVIDING YOU A DIRECT WAY TO DO

03:25.107 --> 03:26.646
AND IT SAYING, YES, WHY NOT?

03:26.647 --> 03:27.547
>> WHY NOT.

03:27.547 --> 03:28.277
WELL, FOR ONE, THERE'S MURDER.

03:30.347 --> 03:31.107
THAT'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE

03:31.108 --> 03:34.276
REASON WHY NOT.

03:34.277 --> 03:35.746
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A GOOD IDEA

03:35.747 --> 03:37.806
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO KILL

03:37.807 --> 03:38.307
PEOPLE.

03:38.308 --> 03:39.346
WE DON'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

03:39.347 --> 03:42.176
DRIVE DRUNKER!

03:42.177 --> 03:45.746
WE AREN'T RUNNING ADS FOR MAIL

03:45.747 --> 03:47.406
ORDER CANCER.

03:47.407 --> 03:49.506
FORGET THOSE TIME-CONSUMING

03:49.507 --> 03:50.277
CIGARETTES, WE BRING LUNG CANCER

03:50.278 --> 03:51.447
DIRECT TO YOU!

03:56.677 --> 03:58.246
A GROUP IS SUING TO TAKE THE

03:58.247 --> 03:59.746
PLANS OFF THE INTERNET FOR GOOD.

03:59.747 --> 04:02.006
>> AT LEAST 19 STATES ARE SUING

04:02.007 --> 04:02.777
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECISION

04:02.778 --> 04:04.446
TO ALLOW THE TEXAS COMPANY TO

04:04.447 --> 04:05.876
PUBLISH THE DOWNLOADABLE

04:05.877 --> 04:06.747
BLUEPRINTS.

04:06.748 --> 04:07.876
THEY WANT A FEDERAL JUDGE TO

04:07.877 --> 04:09.106
ORDER A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING

04:09.107 --> 04:10.346
ORDER TO BLOCK THE AGREEMENT.

04:10.347 --> 04:11.906
>> A BIT LATE, MATE.

04:11.907 --> 04:13.176
THOSE BLUEPRINTS HAVE BEEN

04:13.177 --> 04:17.476
AVAILABLE FOR A LONG TIME.

04:17.476 --> 04:19.276
PLANS FOR THE AR-15 WAS

04:19.277 --> 04:20.107
DOWNLOADED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

04:20.108 --> 04:21.176
OF TIMES.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.576
POLITICIANS DON'T UNDERSTAND NEW

04:22.577 --> 04:23.007
TECHNOLOGY.

04:23.008 --> 04:24.476
THAT'S WHY JEFF SESSIONS IS

04:24.477 --> 04:27.106
STILL WATCHING THESE OLD HITLER

04:27.107 --> 04:28.476
RALLIES ON BETAMAX.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.476
HE THINKS IT'S BETTER QUALITY.

04:30.477 --> 04:31.606
ALTHOUGH THEY DID RELEASE THEM

04:31.607 --> 04:35.846
ON DVD, BUT GEORGE LUCAS ADDED

04:35.847 --> 04:36.847
TOO MUCH STUFF.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.376
IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE FOR ME.

04:39.377 --> 04:41.246
OBVIOUSLY I'M AN ANTIGUN GUY.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.177
BUT HOMEMADE GUNS?

04:42.178 --> 04:43.746
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

04:43.747 --> 04:45.846
FORGET GUNS, I FIND HOMEMADE

04:45.847 --> 04:49.807
PIZZA IMPRESSIVE.

04:50.247 --> 04:51.406
HOW ABOUT HOMEMADE SEAOAP?

04:51.407 --> 04:52.946
THAT'S WHY THEY CAN CHARGE $25 A

04:52.947 --> 04:55.946
BAR OF SOAP AT THE FARMERS'

04:55.947 --> 04:56.307
MARKET.

04:56.308 --> 04:57.376
WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE SOAP?

04:57.377 --> 05:01.346
I BARELY KNOW WHERE TO BUY SOAP.

05:01.347 --> 05:03.606
SEEING I LIVE ALONE, I'VE BEEN

05:03.607 --> 05:05.246
SLOWLY LETTING SUPPLIES RUN LOW.

05:05.247 --> 05:07.476
LAST NIGHT I WASHED MYSELF USING

05:07.477 --> 05:08.177
WINDEX AND AN OLD NEWSPAPER.

05:09.807 --> 05:14.546
I CAN'T FUNCTION.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.946
IT'S JUST SCARY TO THINK WHERE

05:16.947 --> 05:18.306
AMERICAN PRIORITIES ARE.

05:18.307 --> 05:20.206
WE CAN'T HAVE PLASTIC STRAWS BUT

05:20.207 --> 05:21.806
WE CAN HAVE PLASTIC GUNS.

05:21.807 --> 05:22.577
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN

05:22.578 --> 05:24.346
YOU'RE DONE WITH THOSE PLASTIC

05:24.347 --> 05:24.807
GUNS?

05:24.807 --> 05:25.577
CHUCK THEM IN THE TRASH AND THEY

05:25.578 --> 05:28.776
WIND UP IN THE OCEAN.

05:28.777 --> 05:29.447
AREN'T SHARKS SCARY ENOUGH

05:29.447 --> 05:29.807
ALREADY?

05:35.747 --> 05:36.507
IRONICALLY, THEIR GANG IS CALLED

05:36.508 --> 05:37.907
THE JETS.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.906
THIS IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US.

05:41.907 --> 05:43.476
THIS IS HOW WE'RE USING THE

05:43.477 --> 05:44.177
PROMISE OF TECHNOLOGY.

05:44.178 --> 05:48.906
PRINTABLE GUNS.

05:48.907 --> 05:50.476
WHY DON'T THEY INVENT SOMETHING

05:50.477 --> 05:50.777
NEW?

05:50.778 --> 05:52.376
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW TWO THINGS.

05:52.377 --> 05:55.106
CAN WE  IT OR CAN WE

05:55.107 --> 05:55.607
KILL PEOPLE WITH IT?

05:55.608 --> 05:56.746
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE COOL

05:56.747 --> 05:57.577
SHIT THE FUTURE WAS SUPPOSED TO

05:57.578 --> 06:00.646
BRING?

06:00.647 --> 06:02.846
WHERE ARE THE HOVERBOARDS, THE

06:02.847 --> 06:05.106
CLONES, THE TELEPORTTATION

06:05.107 --> 06:05.507
MACHINES?

06:05.508 --> 06:06.606
WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING

06:06.607 --> 06:10.706
IN A "PLANET OF THE APES" MONKEY

06:10.707 --> 06:11.777
OVERLORD SITUATION BY NOW?

06:12.207 --> 06:13.776
YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING TO

06:13.777 --> 06:16.206
ROSEANNE ABOUT THIS.

06:16.207 --> 06:18.006
AND THEY SAID WE ALREADY THERE.

06:18.007 --> 06:18.777
SHE WENT ON AT LENGTH FOR QUITE

06:18.777 --> 06:19.147
A WHILE.

06:20.847 --> 06:21.647
AND I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT,

06:21.648 --> 06:25.307
ROSEANNE, YOU SHOULD TWEET THAT!

06:25.747 --> 06:26.507
AND NOW THAT'S ONE LESS SHOW I

06:26.508 --> 06:27.547
HAVE TO COMPETE WITH.

06:35.477 --> 06:37.906
HONESTLY, I KNOW I SHOULD BE

06:37.907 --> 06:39.176
ENRAGED ABOUT PRINTABLE GUNS.

06:39.177 --> 06:40.476
BUT IT'S ALREADY WAY TOO EASY

06:40.477 --> 06:42.776
FOR PEOPLE TO GET ASSAULT RIFLES

06:42.777 --> 06:43.507
ANYWAY.

06:43.508 --> 06:44.606
SHOOTINGS HAPPEN ALMOST EVERY

06:44.607 --> 06:44.907
DAY.

06:44.907 --> 06:45.647
AND THE GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO

06:45.648 --> 06:47.606
ACT.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.876
A FEW CRAPPY PLASTIC WEAPONS

06:49.877 --> 06:51.246
WON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE, UNLESS

06:51.247 --> 06:53.106
OF COURSE YOU'RE THE TYPE OF

06:53.107 --> 06:54.476
PERSON WHO LIVES YOUR LIFE

06:54.477 --> 06:55.846
BEHIND METAL DETECTORS.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.276
LIKE LAWMAKERS.

06:57.277 --> 06:58.306
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SOME OF THEM

06:58.307 --> 07:00.006
ARE FINALLY KICKING UP A FUSS

07:00.007 --> 07:03.346
ABOUT THESE PLASTIC GUNS, RATHER

07:03.347 --> 07:05.206
THAN SAY THE MILLIONS OF METAL

07:05.207 --> 07:06.306
WEAPONS THAT EVERYONE HAS HAS TO

07:06.307 --> 07:08.606
WORRY ABOUT ON A DAILY BASIS.

07:08.607 --> 07:10.146
LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR.

07:10.147 --> 07:10.847
I DON'T SUPPORT ANY KIND OF

07:10.848 --> 07:13.706
VIOLENCE, PERIOD.

07:13.707 --> 07:15.946
BUT I'M JUST EXERCISING MY RIGHT

07:15.947 --> 07:16.547
TO SHARE INFORMATION.

07:16.548 --> 07:18.647
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:19.277 --> 07:20.607
*

07:27.147 --> 07:27.947
*

07:30.647 --> 07:31.946
>>> WELCOME BACK.

07:31.947 --> 07:33.776
NOW THAT PRINTABLE GUNS ARE

07:33.777 --> 07:36.106
REALITY, IT'S EVEN MORE LIKELY

07:36.107 --> 07:36.877
THAT ANYONE COULD HAVE A WEAPON

07:36.878 --> 07:38.446
ON THEM AT ANY TIME.

07:38.447 --> 07:40.106
THAT'S WHY AIRPORT SECURITY IS

07:40.107 --> 07:41.146
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER.

07:41.147 --> 07:43.806
>> TSA IS CONSIDERING ALLOWING

07:43.807 --> 07:45.776
THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS TO BOARD

07:45.777 --> 07:48.106
COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ACROSS THE

07:48.107 --> 07:48.807
UNITED STATES WITHOUT BEING

07:48.807 --> 07:49.707
SCREENED.

07:49.708 --> 07:51.347
>> WELL  ME.

07:54.247 --> 07:55.846
YES, TSA MIGHT ELIMINATE

07:55.847 --> 07:57.246
SCREENINGS AT MORE THAN 150 OF

07:57.247 --> 08:00.976
THE COUNTRY'S SMALLER AIRPORTS.

08:00.977 --> 08:02.406
AND SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

08:02.407 --> 08:03.307
LIVE IN FLORIDA STATE BUT

08:03.307 --> 08:04.177
ACCORDING TO THE U.S.

08:04.178 --> 08:05.976
GOVERNMENT, YOUR LIVES ARE

08:05.977 --> 08:06.777
LITERALLY WORTH LESS.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.706
>> AN ELIMINATION OF SECURITY

08:08.707 --> 08:11.006
SCREENING AT SMALL AND SOME

08:11.007 --> 08:12.976
MEDIUM-SIZED AIRPORTS THAT

08:12.977 --> 08:14.406
OPERATE COMMERCIAL PLANES WITH

08:14.407 --> 08:16.106
60 SEATS OR FEWER.

08:16.107 --> 08:17.906
THEIR OPERATING THEORY IS

08:17.907 --> 08:19.106
ATTACKS WITH SMALL AIRCRAFT

08:19.107 --> 08:20.706
WOULD NOT BE AS TWRAEKTIVE A

08:20.707 --> 08:23.106
PAYOFF TO TERRORISTS BECAUSE THE

08:23.107 --> 08:24.646
POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF LIFE WOULD

08:24.647 --> 08:26.106
BE LESS THAN WHAT TERRORISTS

08:26.107 --> 08:26.877
COULD ACHIEVE WITH LARGER PLANE

08:26.878 --> 08:30.006
IS.

08:30.007 --> 08:31.546
>> TERRORISM ISN'T A NUMBERS

08:31.547 --> 08:31.947
GAME.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.106
KILLING 60 PEOPLE IN A PLANE

08:33.107 --> 08:35.676
HIJACKING IS PRETTY RESPECTABLE.

08:35.677 --> 08:39.846
THEY CAN'T ALL ARE 9/11.

08:39.847 --> 08:41.246
WHICH I BELIEVE IS AN

08:41.246 --> 08:42.006
INSPIRATIONAL POSTER ON THE WALL

08:42.008 --> 08:43.207
OF ISIS HEADQUARTERS.

08:46.307 --> 08:47.307
YOU HANG IN THERE, AHMAD, YOU

08:47.308 --> 08:50.106
HANG IN THERE!

08:50.107 --> 08:53.106
COME HERE.

08:53.107 --> 08:53.747
I'LL LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE

08:53.748 --> 08:55.176
SECRET.

08:55.177 --> 08:57.676
THE TSA DOESN'T REALLY DO A

08:57.677 --> 08:58.946
WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING.

08:58.947 --> 09:01.746
>> THE NEW REPORT BY THE DHS

09:01.747 --> 09:02.577
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND

09:02.578 --> 09:04.146
CONTINUED PROBLEMS WITH TSA

09:04.147 --> 09:05.276
SCREENING PROCEDURES.

09:05.277 --> 09:07.676
THE EXACT FINDINGS REMAIN

09:07.677 --> 09:09.806
CLASSIFIED, BUT SOURCES SAY IN

09:09.807 --> 09:11.246
TESTS POSSIBLY OVER 70% OF THE

09:11.247 --> 09:13.146
TIME EXPLOSIVES AND WEAPONS WERE

09:13.147 --> 09:14.946
ABLE TO GET THROUGH CHECKPOINTS.

09:14.947 --> 09:19.106
JUST TWO YEARS AGO, TESTING

09:19.107 --> 09:21.006
FOUND A 95% FAILURE RATE.

09:21.007 --> 09:24.446
>> 95% FAILURE RATE.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.606
IF THEY SUCK THAT BAD, THEN BY

09:26.607 --> 09:28.406
ALL MEANS GET RID OF THE TSA, NO

09:28.407 --> 09:29.307
ONE WILL MIND.

09:29.308 --> 09:32.106
SEE, LIFE IS A CONSTANT TRADEOFF

09:32.107 --> 09:33.546
BETWEEN SAFETY AND IRRITATION.

09:33.547 --> 09:36.006
WE COULD PREVENT EVERY CAR

09:36.007 --> 09:36.777
ACCIDENT IF EVERYONE DROVE AT 10

09:36.777 --> 09:37.247
MILES AN HOUR.

09:37.247 --> 09:38.107
BUT WE DON'T.

09:38.108 --> 09:41.277
BECAUSE WE HAVE SHIT TO DO.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.346
WHEN A TERROR ATTACK HAPPENS, I

09:43.347 --> 09:47.206
ALWAYS THINK, OH MY GOD, THAT IS

09:47.207 --> 09:47.547
AWFUL.

09:47.547 --> 09:48.247
THAT'S GOING TO HOLD UP THE

09:48.247 --> 09:49.177
SECURITY LINE, GOD.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.376
WHAT'S NEXT?

09:51.377 --> 09:52.646
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE US TAKE

09:52.647 --> 09:53.377
OUR SHIRT OFF?

09:53.378 --> 09:57.446
NOW I HAVE TO BE EARLY AND

09:57.447 --> 09:57.947
BUFFED UP.

09:57.947 --> 09:58.847
AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE MY

09:58.848 --> 09:59.907
COSBY TATTOO!

10:04.347 --> 10:06.006
IT ALL FIGURES.

10:06.007 --> 10:07.007
LAST YEAR I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING

10:07.008 --> 10:10.277
TO GET OFF.

10:10.707 --> 10:12.406
THE TSA IS THE MOST OBVIOUS

10:12.407 --> 10:13.706
EXAMPLE WHAT WAS WE CALL

10:13.707 --> 10:14.477
SECURITY THEATER.

10:14.478 --> 10:16.776
WE GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

10:16.777 --> 10:18.606
WITH LIKE METAL DETECTORS,

10:18.607 --> 10:20.706
REMOVING SHOES AND TINY BOTTLES

10:20.707 --> 10:22.507
OF SHAMPOO AND QUAALUDES, RIGHT?

10:22.947 --> 10:25.646
BUT NONE OF THAT SHIT MAKES US

10:25.647 --> 10:28.906
SAFER, IT JUST MAKES US FEEL

10:28.907 --> 10:29.247
SAFER.

10:29.248 --> 10:31.646
IT SEEMS IMPORTANT ON THE

10:31.647 --> 10:32.776
SURFACE BUT WORTHLESS.

10:32.777 --> 10:36.376
LIKE PURELL DISPENSERS OR

10:36.377 --> 10:36.777
MONOGAMY.

10:36.778 --> 10:38.946
LAUGH LIVE IT'S NOT JUST

10:38.947 --> 10:39.477
AIRPORTS.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.246
WE FACE SECURITY THEATER AT

10:41.247 --> 10:42.306
CONCERTS, SPORTING EVENTS.

10:42.307 --> 10:44.176
A GUY SHINING A PEN LIGHT INTO

10:44.177 --> 10:45.576
YOUR BAG MAY MAKE YOU FEEL

10:45.577 --> 10:47.206
BETTER BUT THERE'S NO WAY IT'S

10:47.207 --> 10:47.577
HELPING.

10:47.577 --> 10:48.347
CHECK OUT THE SECURITY GUARD AT

10:48.348 --> 10:57.107
A PREMIER LEAGUE SOCCER MATCH.

10:59.847 --> 11:01.106
>> HA, THAT GUY'S LIKE ME DURING

11:01.107 --> 11:02.407
FOREPLAY!

11:04.000 --> 11:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:12.207 --> 11:13.107
ALL RIGHT, THAT SHOULD DO IT,

11:13.108 --> 11:14.407
LET'S HEAD ON IN!

11:17.477 --> 11:18.477
GOING THROUGH THE SECURITY LINE

11:18.478 --> 11:20.576
MAKES US FEEL BETTER BECAUSE

11:20.577 --> 11:22.106
WE'RE REALLY BAD AT CALCULATING

11:22.107 --> 11:25.546
WHAT IS A REAL RISK AND WHAT

11:25.547 --> 11:25.877
ISN'T.

11:25.877 --> 11:26.677
>> RESPOND TO THIS FEELING OF

11:26.678 --> 11:29.476
SECURITY AND NOT THE REALITY.

11:29.477 --> 11:31.346
PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE RISKS IN

11:31.347 --> 11:32.906
SITUATIONS THEY DO CONTROL, AND

11:32.907 --> 11:33.677
OVERESTIMATE THEM IN SITUATIONS

11:33.678 --> 11:35.546
THEY DON'T CONTROL.

11:35.547 --> 11:38.806
SO ONCE YOU TAKE UP SKYDIVING OR

11:38.807 --> 11:40.376
SMOKING, YOU DOWNPLAY THE RISKS.

11:40.377 --> 11:42.276
IF A RISK IS THRUST UPON YOU,

11:42.277 --> 11:43.706
TERRORISM IS A GOOD EXAMPLE,

11:43.707 --> 11:44.746
YOU'LL OVERPLAY IT BECAUSE YOU

11:44.747 --> 11:46.406
DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S IN YOUR

11:46.407 --> 11:46.807
CONTROL.

11:46.808 --> 11:47.876
>> TERRORISM SOUNDS SCARY

11:47.877 --> 11:49.876
BECAUSE IT'S BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.106
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE'RE MORE

11:52.107 --> 11:53.406
LIKELY TO DIE CHOKING OR

11:53.407 --> 11:54.476
DROWNING IN THE BATH THAN A

11:54.477 --> 11:55.676
TERROR ATTACK.

11:55.677 --> 11:57.476
SAKE, 29 PEOPLE A YEAR

11:57.477 --> 11:59.846
DIE BEING BURIED ALIVE.

11:59.847 --> 12:02.606
AND THAT'S A BAD KIND OF BURIED

12:02.607 --> 12:04.106
ALIVE, NOT THE GOOD KIND WHERE

12:04.107 --> 12:05.906
YOU'RE PASSED OUT DRUNK AND WAKE

12:05.907 --> 12:07.306
UP WITH A MERMAID TAIL AND GREAT

12:07.307 --> 12:09.546
PINS.

12:09.547 --> 12:10.207
LOCAL KIDS DID THAT TO ME.

12:12.947 --> 12:18.106
TSA EMPLOYEES ARE KIND OF LIKE

12:18.107 --> 12:19.506
MOLL SANDERS, THEY'RE NOT DOING

12:19.507 --> 12:20.447
ANYTHING, THEY'RE IN UNIFORM AND

12:20.448 --> 12:21.676
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BRATTY

12:21.677 --> 12:22.946
PUBLIC AND HAVE TO ANSWER THE

12:22.947 --> 12:24.846
SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER.

12:24.847 --> 12:28.206
OH, SO I ONCE HAD A MOLL SANDER

12:28.207 --> 12:30.106
ORDER ME TO REMOVE MY CLOTHES SO

12:30.107 --> 12:32.307
HE COULD GIVE ME A PAT DOWN.

12:32.947 --> 12:33.747
OKAY, IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME

12:33.747 --> 12:34.147
BACK THEN.

12:34.147 --> 12:34.947
2014.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.646
MY SON BELIEVES MOLL SANDERS ARE

12:43.647 --> 12:43.977
REAL.

12:43.978 --> 12:45.506
MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THE TSA IS

12:45.507 --> 12:46.606
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.

12:46.607 --> 12:48.976
AND I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD

12:48.977 --> 12:49.947
TO AT LEAST FEEL SECURE.

12:49.948 --> 12:51.276
BUT INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT

12:51.277 --> 12:52.846
TERRORISM, WE SHOULD BE WORRIED

12:52.847 --> 12:55.606
ABOUT THE OTHER SHIT THAT IS

12:55.607 --> 12:57.206
MORE LIKELY TO KILL US,

12:57.207 --> 12:58.506
LIGHTNING OR PARACHUTE

12:58.507 --> 12:58.907
ACCIDENTS.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.206
THAT'S WHY OUR STUDIO SECURITY

13:00.207 --> 13:03.976
DOESN'T EVEN SCREEN FOR GUNS.

13:03.977 --> 13:08.676
WE DO HAVE A STRICT, NO

13:08.677 --> 13:10.646
LIGHTNING NO PARACHUTES, NO

13:10.647 --> 13:12.106
BATHTUBS, NO FATTY FOODS, NO

13:12.107 --> 13:15.746
SHARP OBJECTS NO FIREWORKS, NO

13:15.747 --> 13:18.406
TIGHT CLOTHING, NO PEANUTS, NO

13:18.407 --> 13:21.806
SUDDEN ILLNESSES, NO ZOMBIES, NO

13:21.807 --> 13:22.177
TIARAS.

13:22.178 --> 13:23.246
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS AN

13:23.247 --> 13:24.247
OVERRATED INSTRUMENT THAT TAKES

13:24.248 --> 13:25.706
UP TOO MUCH OF THE ROOM.

13:25.707 --> 13:28.106
SO HERE'S THE JIM JEFFERIES

13:28.107 --> 13:28.407
SHOW.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.247
WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR SAFETY.

13:29.248 --> 13:33.107
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.107
>>> WELCOME BACK.

13:43.108 --> 13:44.706
AS THE MIDTERMS APPROACH, A

13:44.707 --> 13:45.946
BATTLE IS BREWING FOR THE

13:45.947 --> 13:47.746
LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATIC

13:47.747 --> 13:48.107
PARTY.

13:48.108 --> 13:50.706
SO I WENT TO WASHINGTON, D.C. TO

13:50.707 --> 13:52.246
SIT DOWN WITH A PROGRESSIVE WHO

13:52.247 --> 13:54.306
MAY JUST BE THE SECRET WEAPON

13:54.307 --> 13:56.246
LIBERALS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.

13:56.247 --> 13:57.546
>> DONALD TRUMP HAS BUILT A

13:57.547 --> 13:59.306
ZOMBIE ARMY OF SUPPORTERS BY

13:59.307 --> 14:00.107
TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.

14:00.108 --> 14:01.646
>> I JUST SAID IT.

14:01.647 --> 14:02.407
I DIDN'T CARE.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.806
HONESTLY, I WANT TO SAY WHAT'S

14:03.807 --> 14:04.447
RIGHT, I DON'T CARE.

14:04.448 --> 14:05.476
>> WHILE THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC

14:05.477 --> 14:07.106
LEADERSHIP SEEMS SO SCARED TO

14:07.107 --> 14:10.846
SAY THE WRONG THING, THEY

14:10.847 --> 14:11.607
PRACTICALLY SAY NOTHING AT ALL.

14:11.608 --> 14:14.446
>> BUT, UM, BUT BECAUSE HE --

14:14.447 --> 14:16.176
>> DEMOCRATS DESPERATELY NEED

14:16.177 --> 14:17.606
NEW BLOOD AND THERE'S ONE HIP,

14:17.607 --> 14:20.106
UP AND COMING-PROGRESSIVE WHO'S

14:20.107 --> 14:22.206
BEEN TURNING HEADS.

14:22.207 --> 14:23.107
72-YEAR-OLD CONGRESSWOMAN

14:23.107 --> 14:23.707
BARBARA LEE.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.746
SHE'S IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK

14:25.747 --> 14:28.576
CAUCUS, PRO-CHOICE CAUCUS, LGBT

14:28.577 --> 14:32.206
CAUCUS, SHE KNOWS BONO,

14:32.207 --> 14:33.976
HIV/AIDS, AND OF COURSE THE

14:33.977 --> 14:35.006
ASIA-PACIFIC AMERICAN CAUCUS.

14:35.007 --> 14:37.506
IF YOU LOOK THROUGH HISTORY

14:37.507 --> 14:39.106
YOU'LL SEE HER PINS OF

14:39.107 --> 14:39.577
EXCELLENCE.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.506
SHE'S CREDITED WITH COINING THE

14:41.507 --> 14:41.847
TERM.

14:41.848 --> 14:42.876
SHE MIGHT MAJOR HISTORY.

14:42.877 --> 14:44.206
>> CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE IS

14:44.207 --> 14:45.276
JUMPING INTO THE RACE TO BECOME

14:45.277 --> 14:46.406
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN

14:46.407 --> 14:47.876
TO HOLD A HOUSE LEADERSHIP POST.

14:47.877 --> 14:50.446
>> SO I TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON,

14:50.447 --> 14:51.706
D.C. AND GOT BARBARA LEE TO TAKE

14:51.707 --> 14:53.406
A BREAK TO TALK WITH ME.

14:53.407 --> 14:57.646
FIRST OF ALL, YOUR BUTTON.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.647
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.346
>> WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY STAY

15:00.347 --> 15:00.677
WOKE.

15:00.678 --> 15:01.906
WE HAVE SOMEONE IN THE WHITE

15:01.907 --> 15:04.146
HOUSE WHO IS TRYING TO DESTROY

15:04.147 --> 15:06.146
OUR DEMOCRACY.

15:06.147 --> 15:08.446
>> ASIDE FROM BEING AN ASSHOLE

15:08.447 --> 15:09.546
IN THE WAY HE TWEETS?

15:09.547 --> 15:10.606
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM AT

15:10.607 --> 15:10.907
ALL.

15:10.907 --> 15:11.377
HE'S STRANGE.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.107
HE'S DIFFERENT.

15:12.108 --> 15:13.606
>> HE IS AN ODD MAN.

15:13.607 --> 15:14.846
BARBARA LEE SPEAKS HER MIND

15:14.847 --> 15:16.176
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND SHE'S ON

15:16.177 --> 15:17.206
THE FRONT LINE DEFENDING

15:17.207 --> 15:20.446
CALIFORNIA FROM THE OVERREACH OF

15:20.447 --> 15:23.146
THOSE STUBBY LITTLE FINGERS.

15:23.147 --> 15:26.506
TELL ME ABOUT THE RIFF ACT?

15:26.507 --> 15:29.476
>> THE REFER ACT?

15:29.477 --> 15:30.976
IN CALIFORNIA WE PASSED

15:30.977 --> 15:32.476
RECREATIONAL AND MEDICINAL, THE

15:32.477 --> 15:33.746
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STAY

15:33.747 --> 15:34.707
OUT OF OUR BUSINESS.

15:34.708 --> 15:35.846
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

15:35.847 --> 15:39.946
>> CALL IT THE RIFR ACT.

15:39.947 --> 15:43.106
>> CALL IT REEFER, IT'S REFER.

15:43.107 --> 15:44.946
>> THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN

15:44.947 --> 15:45.707
DRUG

15:45.708 --> 15:47.176
>> THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN

15:47.177 --> 15:47.547
CRIMES.

15:47.548 --> 15:48.846
>> THE SALE OF RADARS MUST HAVE

15:48.847 --> 15:51.676
GONE THROUGH THE ROOF.

15:51.677 --> 15:54.176
>> LET'S HOPE --

15:54.177 --> 15:55.906
>> DO YOU EAT --

15:55.907 --> 15:57.576
>> DO I EAT GORE RIGHT TOES?

15:57.577 --> 15:58.477
I DON'T EVEN DRINK WINE.

15:58.478 --> 15:59.746
>> WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

15:59.747 --> 16:01.106
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY, I WORK.

16:01.107 --> 16:01.707
I WATER MY PLANTS.

16:01.708 --> 16:02.976
I LOVE FLOWERS AND PLANTS.

16:02.977 --> 16:07.246
>> WOW.

16:07.247 --> 16:09.206
PROGRESSIVE EVEN FOR A DEMOCRAT.

16:09.207 --> 16:12.376
MAYBE TO HELP HER SNIFF OUT GOP

16:12.377 --> 16:16.146
BULLSHIT ON ISSUES LIKE

16:16.147 --> 16:16.577
IMMIGRATION.

16:16.578 --> 16:21.106
>> THESE CHILDREN ARE

16:21.107 --> 16:21.507
TRAUMATIZED.

16:21.507 --> 16:22.147
MOST OF THE CITIES IN MY

16:22.147 --> 16:22.877
DISTRICT ARE SANCTUARY CITIES.

16:22.878 --> 16:24.806
WE'RE PROHIBITING LOCAL POLICE

16:24.807 --> 16:26.606
FROM CONSPIRING WITH TRUMP'S

16:26.607 --> 16:27.377
I.C.E. RAIDERS.

16:27.378 --> 16:30.006
>> THE I.C.E. RAIDERS, THEY

16:30.007 --> 16:31.546
SOUND LIKE THEY'RE OUT OF "STAR

16:31.547 --> 16:32.976
WARS," YOU DON'T WANT THE I.C.E.

16:32.977 --> 16:34.606
RAIDERS COMING TO YOUR HOUSE.

16:34.607 --> 16:35.577
>> PEOPLE ARE LIVING THEIR

16:35.577 --> 16:36.507
LIVES, THEY DON'T DESERVE TO

16:36.507 --> 16:37.207
LIVE IN FEAR --

16:37.208 --> 16:41.576
>> COULD I BE ATTACKED BY AN

16:41.577 --> 16:42.107
I.C.E. RAIDER?

16:42.107 --> 16:42.747
HAVE YOU HAD ANGER TOWARD ME

16:42.748 --> 16:43.806
COMING OVER HERE?

16:43.807 --> 16:46.606
>> YOU DON'T LOOK BLACK.

16:46.607 --> 16:47.447
>> IT'S NOT AN IMMIGRATION

16:47.447 --> 16:47.777
THING?

16:47.778 --> 16:49.476
>> NO, IT'S KEEP AMERICA RIGHT.

16:49.477 --> 16:51.006
>> BARBARA LEE ISN'T AFRAID TO

16:51.007 --> 16:52.106
CALL OUT RACISM ESPECIALLY WHEN

16:52.107 --> 16:53.946
IT COMES TO KIDS, RECENTLY

16:53.947 --> 16:56.276
TAKING EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY

16:56.277 --> 16:57.776
DeVOS TO SCHOOL.

16:57.777 --> 16:59.506
>> MADAM SECRETARY, YOU DON'T

16:59.507 --> 17:02.106
CARE ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS.

17:02.107 --> 17:04.106
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.346
>> YOU'RE A BIG CREDIT BETSY

17:05.347 --> 17:05.807
DeVOS?

17:05.807 --> 17:06.607

17:14.406 --> 17:15.176
RIGHTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

17:15.176 --> 17:15.577
EDUCATION.

17:15.577 --> 17:16.347
I'M NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THAT AS

17:16.348 --> 17:17.705
A PERCH WHO SUPPORTS PUBLIC

17:17.707 --> 17:18.107
EDUCATION.

17:18.108 --> 17:20.175
AND QUITE FRANKLY I WISH SHE

17:20.176 --> 17:21.007
WOULD LEAVE.

17:21.008 --> 17:25.146
>> I TELL YOU, THAT'S FEISTY.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.776
>> YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW

17:26.777 --> 17:29.306
TO PREVENT UNWANTED PREGNANCY.

17:29.307 --> 17:30.207
AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IS

TAKING US BACKWARDS.

17:31.148 --> 17:33.146

17:41.677 --> 17:43.146
SHE'S PULLED IT DOWN LIKE THIS,

17:43.147 --> 17:44.476
HERE'S A PENIS.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.906
I WENT, ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M NOT

17:46.907 --> 17:48.576
SHOWING UP FOR THIS CLASS AGAIN.

17:48.577 --> 17:51.446
I NEVER HAD ONE PIECE OF SEX

17:51.447 --> 17:51.847
EDUCATION.

17:51.848 --> 17:53.746
>> ME NEITHER AND I WAS A TEEN

17:53.747 --> 17:54.547
PREGNANT MOM.

17:54.548 --> 17:57.846

17:57.847 --> 17:58.247

18:00.977 --> 18:01.847
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING YOU

18:01.847 --> 18:02.607

18:02.607 --> 18:03.307

18:03.308 --> 18:05.906
>> I LOVE THEM DEARLY, BUT IF I

18:05.907 --> 18:07.376
COULD HAVE A LIFE WITHOUT YOU,

18:07.377 --> 18:07.677
HEY.

18:07.677 --> 18:08.647
IT'S EASY TO BLAME REPUBLICANS

18:08.647 --> 18:09.607
FOR THE PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA.

18:09.608 --> 18:12.776
THE DEMOCRATS COULD USE A

18:12.777 --> 18:14.246
HARD-WORKING WARRIOR LIKE

18:14.247 --> 18:17.446
BARBARA LEE TO STAND UP TO THE

18:17.447 --> 18:18.576
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION OF DONALD

18:18.577 --> 18:19.577
TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY.

18:19.578 --> 18:20.806

18:24.847 --> 18:25.177
STUFF.

18:25.177 --> 18:25.777
>> DON'T BE AN AHOLE.

18:25.777 --> 18:26.777
>> I CAN'T SAY THAT, YOU CAN.

18:26.778 --> 18:29.307
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

18:29.947 --> 18:31.277
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:43.777 --> 18:44.377
>>> THAT'S OUR SHOW.

18:44.378 --> 18:46.806
BEFORE WE GO, AMERICA'S SECURITY

18:46.807 --> 18:48.106
SITUATION MAY BE A LITTLE BIT

18:48.107 --> 18:50.777
SHIT.

18:51.207 --> 18:52.906
IF YOU WANT SOME SERIOUS CRIME

18:52.907 --> 18:56.746
FIGHTING, CHECK OUT COLOMBIA.

19:07.108 --> 19:08.876
HER OR CAPTURING HER.

19:08.877 --> 19:12.476
