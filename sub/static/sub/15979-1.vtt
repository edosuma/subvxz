WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.138
Hi.
Oh, welcome to the open house.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.074
Thank you.
Okay, it's a two-bedroom,

00:06.107 --> 00:07.475
one-story unit,
perfect for a single

00:07.508 --> 00:09.377
or a... couple?

00:11.412 --> 00:13.414
(laughs)

00:17.418 --> 00:19.520
No! No, no, no,
no, no, no!

00:21.122 --> 00:22.590
The apartment would
just be for me.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.292
Okay.
I got divorced
about a year ago,

00:24.325 --> 00:26.294
and have been living
with my son ever since.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.395
She doesn't care, Mom.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.462
He's right.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.231
Let me know
if you have questions.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.266
Oh, my, Nate!

00:32.300 --> 00:34.535
And it comes fully furnished!

00:34.568 --> 00:36.304
This looks perfect!

00:36.337 --> 00:38.439
Really? Gosh, I don't know.
I'm not so sure...

00:38.472 --> 00:40.174
Are you kidding?!

00:40.208 --> 00:41.309
Look at these glass doors.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.610
I can see the whole block.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.079
Yeah, but they can
also see you.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.280
Say good-bye to watching
Wheel of Fortune

00:46.314 --> 00:49.250
with your pants unbuttoned.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.752
And I can make the second
bedroom into a craft room.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.455
Well, obviously I'm all for that
so you could knit me

00:54.488 --> 00:58.226
more cell phone holders
that look like tiny overalls.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.228
I don't know, Mom. This...

01:00.261 --> 01:02.363
this place is kind of pricey.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.532
I would be dipping
into my savings.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.534
I'd just hate to think
that all that money you saved

01:06.567 --> 01:08.536
sneaking rotisserie chickens
into movie theaters

01:08.569 --> 01:11.339
was for nothing.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.341
So, any questions?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.376
My heart loves it,
but my pocketbook doesn't.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.678
Sorry, it's not right for me.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.286
I'm so lucky to have a son who
looks out for me the way you do.

01:25.319 --> 01:29.123
It just would've been
so fun to be neighbors.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.558
So fun.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.126
(door closes)

01:32.160 --> 01:33.127
So fun!

01:33.161 --> 01:35.596
So close! So close!

02:02.890 --> 02:04.858
How's the house hunt going, Mom?

02:04.892 --> 02:07.428
The apartment across the hall
from Nathan's was great,

02:07.461 --> 02:08.929
but he convinced me
it was too expensive.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.633
So, he printed me out a list
of places that I could afford.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.202
"Across the hall"?
Oh, my God.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.604
How close were you to burning
down the whole building?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.207
I had the matches in my pocket.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.511
(car horn honks outside)

02:23.544 --> 02:26.480
Okay, I'm off to Lily's
for the weekend.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.782
I'll be back on Monday
unless I can talk

02:28.816 --> 02:31.952
her rich parents
into adopting me.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
It's probably for the best.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.325
We haven't even started
you a college fund.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.626
Okay, I'll walk you out.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.860
No, I'll do it.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.496
I want to find out
why her father's mall

02:42.530 --> 02:44.965
doesn't have a Talbots.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.834
All right, let's have a look
at this apartment list.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.603
Two places on Milton,
one on Magnolia.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.805
Wait a minute.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.443
Every place on this list
is in our neighborhood.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.945
That's right.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.780
I did my time.

02:59.813 --> 03:03.584
I ain't going back to Shawshank.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.619
You need to do your part anyway.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.854
Oh, I do my part.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.888
It's called Dad.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.658
Are you kidding? Dad's easy.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.860
It's like taking care
of an old plant.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.663
Yeah, well, that old plant

03:15.696 --> 03:17.898
has been bringing home
a different old female plant

03:17.931 --> 03:20.901
every night.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.237
Yeah. It is not easy
sleeping through

03:23.271 --> 03:26.274
the sound of dry rustling
bushes in the room next door.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.010
I can't officially tell you

03:30.043 --> 03:31.745
we'll have a Talbots
by Christmas,

03:31.779 --> 03:34.515
but if you're looking to get me
a reasonably priced

03:34.548 --> 03:36.650
seasonal turtleneck,
you might want to hold off.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.953
I'll go see if there's
some more of those popsicles

03:39.987 --> 03:42.623
in the freezer.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.658
Hey, y'all.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.929
ALL:
Hey.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.899
Who was that?

03:51.932 --> 03:54.001
I think she said
her name is Kathy.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.769
I'm not sure,
but she's been here so long

03:55.803 --> 03:57.471
I don't think I can ask.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.908
Met her over
at Shrugging Pines.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.277
The old folks home
over on Elm?!

04:03.311 --> 04:04.912
That's where you're
picking up women?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.481
Boy, you're really going
for the low-hanging fruits.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.384
I'm surprised they go for yours.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.655
It is not an old folks home.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.057
It's an active senior
living community.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.158
You should stop by.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.928
Some of those women could
really use a mother figure.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.865
NATHAN:
So, um...

04:24.898 --> 04:25.999
my dad here tells me

04:26.033 --> 04:27.968
that you live at
Shrugging Pines.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.570
How do you, uh, how
do you like it?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.838
Oh, I love it!

04:30.871 --> 04:32.706
They have activities,
private apartments

04:32.740 --> 04:34.442
and three different craft rooms.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.410
Three craft rooms?
Mm-hmm.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.779
Guess how many different colored
pipe cleaners they have.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.047
Eight?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.382
42.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.684
Get out!
Yeah!

04:43.717 --> 04:46.354
The only thing they don't have

04:46.387 --> 04:48.356
is this guy!

04:48.389 --> 04:49.923
(laughs)
Popcorn!

04:49.957 --> 04:51.625
Popcorn!
Hey! I said popcorn!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.927
That's our safe word!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.396
Well, Mom, I don't know.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.465
I think, uh,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.099
I think maybe we ought
to check it out.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.100
It does sound nice.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.436
And it's only four blocks
away from Debbie.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.772
I know!
Yeah.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.010
MAN:
We hope you've enjoyed
the tour

05:10.043 --> 05:13.347
and look forward to seeing you
again here at Shrugging Pines,

05:13.381 --> 05:15.383
the best decision you can make

05:15.416 --> 05:18.986
for the rest of your life...

05:19.019 --> 05:21.689
is what you would've heard
had the dang DVD player worked!

05:21.722 --> 05:22.956
Aah!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.558
This is wonderful, Kip!

05:24.592 --> 05:25.726
As was the whole tour.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.661
I'm very impressed.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.096
Oh, thank you.
That-that means a lot.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.998
Because not only am I
the admissions director,

05:31.031 --> 05:33.133
but I'm also
the activities coordinator,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.069
the facilities manager
and the Marco Polo umpire.

05:38.506 --> 05:42.075
You're not a peeker,
are you, Carol?

05:42.109 --> 05:43.911
Hmm? Me? No.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.946
Carol?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.648
Maybe a little peek?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.418
Huh? A little peeky-poo?
(laughs)

05:50.451 --> 05:52.085
A little, a little
pookity-peekity?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.921
Maybe I peek a little.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.556
(both laughing)

05:55.589 --> 05:57.090
I'm gonna blow my
whistle on you, Carol!

05:57.124 --> 05:59.993
(squeals)
Come here, you!

06:00.027 --> 06:02.630
What I'm saying is...

06:02.663 --> 06:04.565
I live this job

06:04.598 --> 06:07.535
24 H's a D.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.505
I actually live
in a room out back.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.774
Except for one weekend a month.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.644
Those two days belong
to the National Guard.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.011
I...

06:18.045 --> 06:19.980
know what you're thinking and...
(laughs)

06:20.013 --> 06:21.615
you're both welcome.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.052
(clears throat)
Well...

06:25.085 --> 06:27.421
I just, I-I love the place.
Mm-hmm.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.857
I...
Aw, thank you, sir.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.625
Yeah.
And, of course,
when you visit,

06:31.659 --> 06:33.894
there will be full discretion
at all times

06:33.927 --> 06:37.665
to protect your privacy,
Mr. Miller.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.969
I know who you are.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.605
My ex-husband Leon
is quite the fan.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.707
Spent many a night
between the sheets

06:46.740 --> 06:49.577
watching you walk our streets.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.112
So glad to be part of that.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.048
Um, now if my mom is interested,

06:55.082 --> 06:56.650
how quickly can this happen?

06:56.684 --> 06:58.586
'Cause I mean,
I-I can just leave here.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.788
And if you've got a gift shop,
I'll just buy her a tooth brush

07:00.821 --> 07:02.490
and she's good to go!

07:02.523 --> 07:05.659
Unfortunately there are
nine people in front of you.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.596
With modern medicine,
the wait could be pretty long.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.763
(bell rings)

07:09.797 --> 07:11.499
Oop! Make that eight people.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.768
I'm kidding!
That's the lunch bell!

07:14.802 --> 07:16.604
(whistle blowing)

07:16.637 --> 07:17.838
Who's hungry, huh?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.039
Who wants to see
the second longest

07:19.072 --> 07:21.074
Jell-O bar in Virginia?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.816
I bet the head of admissions
would've bumped me up

07:28.849 --> 07:31.819
on the list if you'd
just flirted a little.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.621
Ooh! Was she cute?

07:33.654 --> 07:36.624
He was cute
and he winked at Nathan.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.159
He was just impressed
that I'm a local celebrity.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.994
And if Nathan had
just winked back,

07:41.028 --> 07:43.664
I bet I'd be in.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.932
I helped you out
plenty of times,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.768
flirting with people
I wasn't into.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.670
What? When?

07:49.703 --> 07:52.673
Not everyone who applies
to Space Camp gets in.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.277
I think I know why you didn't
flirt with this guy.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.178
Are you gonna say it's
because of that dream I had

07:58.211 --> 08:00.681
about me and the
Dukes of Hazzard boys?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.651
I told you it's mo...
mostly about the car.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.186
I think deep, deep down

08:06.219 --> 08:07.821
you don't want your
mother to move out.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.022
Look what she made.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.524
Look at this.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.526
Fancy cheeses, crackers,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.528
evenly sliced salami.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.564
Brother, you are
hooked on snacks.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.566
Yes, I-I do enjoy

08:18.599 --> 08:21.034
a well-orchestrated cheese plate
after a hard day's work.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.570
But I don't need it.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.937
Trust me, I want her out.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.005
Well, prove it.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.874
Go shake what
your mother gave you

08:26.907 --> 08:28.208
so you can shake your mother.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.578
Flirt with a guy?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.846
Yeah, it's 2014!
There's no shame in it.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.848
I flirt with guys
all the time.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.685
I haven't paid for a ginger
ale on a flight in years!

08:37.718 --> 08:38.919
(laughs)

08:40.087 --> 08:42.590
Yeah, those are free.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.727
Then I've been tickling
kneecaps for nothing?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.868
(knocking)

09:03.243 --> 09:04.845
Hey, Kip.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.682
I just came by to drop off
my mom's applicash.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.985
Sorry if it's a little sweaty.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.222
I filled it out
between reps at the gym.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.125
(sighs)

09:18.158 --> 09:20.327
(exhales)

09:21.929 --> 09:23.597
Wow.
(laughs)

09:23.631 --> 09:26.834
I never noticed how long
your eyelashes are.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.203
Was your mom Betty Boop

09:30.237 --> 09:32.740
and your dad...

09:32.773 --> 09:35.676
also Betty Boop?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.179
First of all,
you're as straight as an arrow

09:39.212 --> 09:41.649
dipped in fantasy football.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.617
I mean, you're pathetic.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.252
You remind me
of my flight attendant days

09:45.285 --> 09:47.988
when some guy tickled my
kneecaps for a free ginger ale.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.992
Look, I'm-I'm...

09:52.025 --> 09:53.260
I'm sorry. I just...

09:53.293 --> 09:54.628
I was just trying
to help out my mom.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.729
No, I-I-I understand.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.164
That's very nice, but...

09:57.197 --> 10:00.167
you're barking up the wrong gay
with this guy.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.935
My ex-husband Leon

10:01.969 --> 10:04.805
is the one who had
the crush on you, not me.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.740
(laughs)

10:06.774 --> 10:10.110
I'm a, I'm an Anderson Cooper
man myself.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.014
You're a little dumb for me.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.883
What?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.885
Uh, I'm not dumb.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.920
Mm....

10:20.921 --> 10:22.422
I'm not!
Aw.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.891
That's the spirit.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.226
God.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.861
If Leon could see me
talking to you.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.063
it would really get his goat.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.033
He doesn't actually have a goat.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.301
Yeah, I know that.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.669
Okay.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.770
It's an idiom.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.705
Yeah, I'm not stupid.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.739
Yeah.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.275
I'd do anything to see
the look on Leon's face

10:42.309 --> 10:44.678
if he saw you flirting with me.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.714
And I'd give anything to get
my mom into this place.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.923
How'd it go?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.125
Great, we're dating.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.793
Are you being facetious?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.896
'Cause if you're serious,
I owe your father 20 bucks.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.372
Cute place, Nathan.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.207
Love the treadmill
in the living room.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.743
(mouthing)

11:17.210 --> 11:20.180
Okay, so just to be clear, uh,
this is a one-time thing.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.782
I-I'm not
ready to commit

11:21.815 --> 11:24.752
to a long-term
imaginary relationship.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.453
Once is all I need.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.756
Leon will come here in a few
hours and drop off Pugsley,

11:28.789 --> 11:30.858
the pug we share custody of.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.060
He will see that
not only have I rebounded,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.795
but I've done so
with his newsboy crush.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.496
He'll beg me to come back,

11:36.529 --> 11:37.731
I'll say "hell no,"

11:37.765 --> 11:40.333
and then Carol and I skip all
the way to the Marco Polo pool.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.203
Marco!
Polo!
Gotcha!

11:45.538 --> 11:49.042
But first, let's focus on making
you believable as my boyfriend.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.979
CAROL:
Oh, don't worry-- my Nathan
is excellent at pretending.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.514
And if you actually feel
something real, just go with it.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.250
He'd make
a nice son-in-law,

11:57.284 --> 11:59.286
and you know I love a parade.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.123
Okay, you need to know
everything about me.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.392
Here's the first 40 pages
of my autobiography,

12:05.425 --> 12:09.262
and here are all my applications
to The Real Worl since '91.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.332
We're gonna to have to cram,

12:12.365 --> 12:13.934
so I suggest you put on
some coffee.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.003
Uh. Well, yeah.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.771
Actually, you know
what? I'm out of coffee.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.239
But, that's okay--
I'll run out and grab some.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.275
Oh, then grab a pen because
my order is very complicated,

12:22.309 --> 12:23.543
and I don't want to overwhelm

12:23.576 --> 12:25.145
that pretty little
head of yours.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.513
Ready?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.248
Ready.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.951
Small.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.921
Black.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.389
Coffee.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.858
Read it back.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.365
Kip is a Virgo trapped
in a Gemini's body.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.868
He likes luge, but not bobsled.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.569
And he has four scars
on his left thigh

12:49.602 --> 12:51.905
from being stabbed
with a salad fork.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.840
Right thigh, chopsticks.

12:52.873 --> 12:57.277
Damn it, Miller,
get your head in the game!

12:57.310 --> 13:00.948
I'm gonna have you teach
a craft class, Carol.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.350
What are these,
overalls for your phone?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.820
They're Osh Kosh B'dorable.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.589
Thank you.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.224
Tom never appreciated
my crafts.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.860
He said why do things by hand,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.294
when you can just go
to the store.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.563
Ugh.
Made me so angry.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.399
I made him do things by hand
for the next ten years.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.941
Husbands are the worst.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.144
Leon never supported
any of my passions.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.881
He hated the fact
that I spoke two languages.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.148
Really?
What do you speak?

13:35.182 --> 13:37.284
English and Latin.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.220
Comma, pig.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.122
Pig Latin. I know it's stupid.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.924
On't-day e-bay illy-say.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.127
Oh, anks-thay Arol-cay.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.130
Leon would yell when I tried
to speak it around the house.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.932
But what should
I have expected

13:51.965 --> 13:53.633
from a man who divorced
me through a text?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.337
I've said it for years--
cell phones are evil.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.006
That's why I put 'em
in overalls

13:59.039 --> 14:00.107
to make them seem
more approachable.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.212
Hey, Kip. Uh, it says here
that you were the captain

14:05.245 --> 14:06.413
of your high school
football team?

14:06.446 --> 14:07.414
Mm-hmm.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.516
And that you were also
the head cheerleader.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.319
Yeah, I was pretty tired
by the end of the game.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.587
(knocking on door)

14:14.621 --> 14:15.989
Oh, God-- he's here.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

14:16.023 --> 14:16.957
Um, Carol,
in the kitchen!
Yeah. Yeah.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.991
How do I look?

14:18.025 --> 14:18.992
Rhetorical question.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.160
I kind of know I look great.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.394
Let's do this.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.330
Oh.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.364
NATHAN:
Ray?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.365
Oh, man, I forgot to call.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.366
Sorry, I-I can't make the game.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.400
I'm kind of busy right now.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.969
Oh, that's today?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.503
This the dude?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.106
You guys make
a cute couple.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.175
I'd give you two
my unwanted baby.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.578
Man, we'll talk later, okay?

14:38.611 --> 14:39.579
You got to go.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.048
(knocking on door)

14:41.081 --> 14:42.249
Uh, too late.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.650
Uh, you're part
of this now.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.584
You're our friend,

14:44.617 --> 14:46.219
a three-star Michelin chef
from New York

14:46.253 --> 14:47.921
who took the train down
to cook us a dinner

14:47.955 --> 14:49.522
to celebrate
our three-month anniversary.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.559
You were raised in an orphanage,
and you have low self-esteem.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.062
Can my restaurant
be in Little Italy?
Why not?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.964
Badda-bing,
badda-boom! Boom!

14:56.997 --> 14:57.897
(knocking)
Nate, Nate, Nate.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.632
Go upstairs so you can
make an entrance.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.468
Go, go, go.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.603
Here's Pugsley.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.306
He's in a timeout for
talking back to me in the car.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.343
Whose place is this?

15:10.377 --> 15:14.314
And, barf, why is there a
treadmill in the living room?

15:14.347 --> 15:17.017
This is my boyfriend's place,
Leon.

15:17.050 --> 15:17.951
Boyfriend?

15:17.985 --> 15:20.053
Odd. All the times
I've dropped off Pugsley

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
you never mentioned
a boyfriend once.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.192
We had to keep it under wraps
as a matter of discretion.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.427
He's a public figure.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.963
In fact, you may know him.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.965
You must be Leon.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.501
(high-pitched gasp)

15:35.668 --> 15:37.070
Chowder's almost ready.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.007
I bet my mama liked chowder.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.343
I'll never know.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.014
I just love
everything about him.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.715
From his size 10.5 tennis shoes

15:48.748 --> 15:51.718
to the fact that he graduated
from Colgate with a 3.9.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.454
BOTH:
Blood-alcohol content.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.360
Chowder's peaking
to perfection.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.495
I made enough for 45.

16:02.529 --> 16:06.233
That's the only way I learned
at the orphanage.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.072
I cannot believe that
it's been three months.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.042
And we spent
every single day together.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.143
You spent every day together?

16:16.176 --> 16:19.046
Oh, yeah. Our relationship has
perfect attendance.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.113
Really?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.381
Because if I recall,

16:21.414 --> 16:24.117
the National Guard doesn't allow
guests those two days a month.

16:24.151 --> 16:28.021
So, how have you been
together every day?

16:28.055 --> 16:31.524
Well, I stayed
in Kip's car at the base.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.160
You stayed in Kip's car?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.195
He means scooter.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.263
Right, Scooter's car.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.730
No, I have a scooter.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.467
He means scooter.
He knows I don't drive.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.337
As does anybody who's read my
autobiography, Kip on a Scooter.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.241
Things are not going great
out there.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.376
I don't think it's gonna work.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.377
I'm not an actor!

16:50.410 --> 16:51.778
I'm not an
actor, either.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.281
But all acting is is
committing to the role.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.815
Now if you want your
mother out of your house,

16:55.848 --> 16:56.816
you have to commit.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.218
Now, I don't
have a mama.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.319
But if I did
have a mama...

16:59.352 --> 17:00.353
Wait, y-you do have a mother.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.221
She lives in Phoenix.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.589
She sends you a cheesecake
once a month.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.725
I'm committing to
a role right now.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.827
You can get your
mother out the house.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.729
But you have to
commit to the role.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.165
You're right, I got to...
I got to commit.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.266
Commit!

17:13.300 --> 17:16.069
And that's why he could visit me
during my training.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.070
Am I right, hon?

17:17.104 --> 17:19.706
No, you are not right.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.740
You're perfect.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.075
Aw...

17:28.248 --> 17:30.550
Straight lips! Straight lips!

17:33.153 --> 17:34.221
I knew it!

17:34.254 --> 17:36.589
This is just another one
of your stupid stunts, Kip.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.791
God, why can't you just
accept that it's over.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.161
This is more pathetic than when
you secretly put my mail on hold

17:41.194 --> 17:43.130
during my birthday week.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.132
I called my grandma
a bitch for nothing.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.236
Y-You're right. I'm sorry.

17:49.269 --> 17:54.207
You're an immature, psychotic,
borderline sociopath.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.642
I am.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.610
I-I am all of
those things.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.147
Nathan, he's basically saying
I'm a monster,

18:00.180 --> 18:01.648
if you're having trouble
following along.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.652
I don't even think I want
Pugsley around you.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.154
Where'd he go?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.721
Pugsley?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.157
Pugsley!

18:10.190 --> 18:11.224
Time-out
is over!

18:11.258 --> 18:14.294
Pugsley!

18:14.327 --> 18:17.197
Are you just going to
stand there and take that?

18:17.230 --> 18:20.567
This isn't the Kip Finkle I've
known since yesterday at 11:30.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.204
But he's right,
this was a crazy idea.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.638
I don't know why I feel the need

18:25.672 --> 18:27.407
to keep trying
to get back at him.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.375
I'll tell you why.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.510
Because he's a jerk
who broke up with you

18:30.543 --> 18:33.146
over a cellular phone texting.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.383
You just say, "a text."

18:36.416 --> 18:38.718
He never let you have closure.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.588
What kind of man breaks up
a marriage over a textagram?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.691
Again, it's just "text."

18:44.724 --> 18:45.858
Maybe this was a crazy idea,

18:45.892 --> 18:48.461
but it's not your fault
that you did it-- it was his.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.463
When your
marriage ended,

18:50.497 --> 18:53.166
he didn't give you a chance
to tell him how you felt.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.367
Well, this is your chance, Kip.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.568
Lay it on him.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.538
I've got your ack-bay.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.607
LEON:
We're leaving.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
I wouldn't eat the
chowder if I were you.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.943
I think it has
ginger ale in it.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.746
Say good-bye
to Pugsley forever.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.181
(falsetto):
"Bye, psycho!"

19:09.816 --> 19:10.983
Op-stay!

19:11.017 --> 19:14.521
If you utter one more word
in Pig Latin to me, I swear...

19:14.554 --> 19:16.223
Ut-shay up-way.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.790
I-way as-way ared-scay

19:17.824 --> 19:20.293
o-tay ick-stay upway
or-fay eyself-may,

19:20.327 --> 19:21.561
ut-bay ot-nay
anymore-way!

19:21.594 --> 19:23.196
O-nay, o-nay, o-nay.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.734
I am not following any of this.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.869
Maybe I am dumb.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.472
If-way ou-yay ink-thay

19:32.505 --> 19:33.673
ou're-yay azy-cray.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.475
Et-gay out-way!

19:41.514 --> 19:45.552
I wish my Pig Latin teacher
could have seen that.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.589
I love you,
Ister-may Enkins-jay.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.233
I can't believe after all this,
I'm still moving out.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.603
I want you to know how much I
appreciate all you went through

20:03.636 --> 20:05.372
to get me
into Shrugging Pines...

20:05.405 --> 20:08.275
and how frustrated you must be
that I chose not to live there.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.645
I'm just so lucky
to have found a roommate

20:12.679 --> 20:14.247
I'm so compatible with.

20:14.281 --> 20:18.251
Because my handsome son is
a darn tough act to follow.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.387
You have a handsome son?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.489
I can't wait to meet him.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.357
Kidding. You're
very attractive.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.358
On the outside.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.394
Look at him--
he's so confused

20:27.427 --> 20:29.262
Nathan, isn't this
going to be a hoot?

20:29.296 --> 20:33.366
You didn't lose a mother,
you gained a fun, new neighbor.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.634
Ah, it's so great.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.369
Well, I'll just give you guys
a couple months to settle in,

20:36.403 --> 20:38.271
and I'll check back in
after the holidays.
