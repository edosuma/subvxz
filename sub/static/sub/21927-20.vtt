00:01.835 --> 00:03.326
<i>It was a beautiful morning</i>

00:03.545 --> 00:04.911
<i>in East Texas.</i>

00:08.592 --> 00:10.959
<i>The kind of morning
that made you want to get up,</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:14.171
<i>get dressed and test
that acceleration</i>

00:14.389 --> 00:17.302
<i>due to gravity does not depend
on an object's motion.</i>

00:19.311 --> 00:20.643
I love Saturdays.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.847
<i>The Earth causes the
same gravitational acceleration</i>

00:24.066 --> 00:24.772
<i>of everything,</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:27.441
<i>even a doll
and a flying Ping-Pong ball.</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.644
<i>It's not often a man of science</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:33.027
<i>gets to say "Yippee ki-yay,"
and mean it, but...</i>

00:34.076 --> 00:35.362
Yippee ki-yay.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.617
Morning, Herschel.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.911
Hey, George.
Uh, you didn't see a dog

00:43.126 --> 00:44.492
wandering around here, did you?

00:44.753 --> 00:46.494
No. Y'all get a dog?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.705
Uh, sort of. We took him in
after my brother-in-law

00:48.924 --> 00:51.291
had to go live
in a gated community.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.127
Oh, that sounds nice;
uh, they got a no pets policy?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.132
He's in jail, George.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.337
Right, sure.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.468
<i>In physics,</i>

00:57.683 --> 00:58.799
<i>nothing feels better</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:00.349
<i>than predicting an outcome.</i>

01:00.561 --> 01:02.143
<i>I love predictability.</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:04.512
<i>predictable.</i>

01:04.855 --> 01:06.813
<i>Predictable.</i>

01:07.526 --> 01:09.142
<i>My brother peeing
in the shower:</i>

01:09.361 --> 01:10.943
<i>repulsive, but predictable.</i>

01:11.947 --> 01:13.154
<i>What isn't predictable:</i>

01:13.782 --> 01:14.613
<i>dogs.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:17.609
<i>I've always been
terrified of dogs.</i>

01:17.995 --> 01:21.488
<i>To me, they're nothing
but big, furry question marks.</i>

01:21.707 --> 01:23.448
<i>Question marks with teeth.</i>

01:29.673 --> 01:33.587
<i>In panic situations,
I'd often lose consciousness.</i>

01:35.178 --> 01:37.295
<i>This time,
I only lost my voice.</i>

01:37.973 --> 01:38.759
Help.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.089
Please help.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.614
<i>Uh, I was just admiring</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:03.321
<i>Grandpa Smurf's
unique walking stick.</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:04.997
<i>Smurf-a-loo-loo.</i>

02:05.208 --> 02:06.164
<i>That's not my walking stick.</i>

02:06.376 --> 02:07.332
Lunch is ready.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.830
Can you go get your brother?

02:09.170 --> 02:10.161
I'm watching TV.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.746
Just go.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.458
I have to do
smurfing everything around here.

02:15.927 --> 02:16.917
I heard that.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.503
I said "smurfing."

02:18.722 --> 02:20.304
And I heard how you said it.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.262
She can cut her own crusts off.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.136
Sheldon?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.395
<i>Who are you?</i>

02:28.607 --> 02:30.439
You're so cute.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.353
<i>Be careful.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:34.735
What are you doing up there?

02:34.946 --> 02:36.312
Staying alive.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.817
Whose dog is this?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.695
I don't know. Get help.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.196
Well, how did he get
into the garage?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.323
Please get help.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.449
Maybe we can keep it.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.789
I'm begging you, get help now.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.496
First, I have
to tell you something.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.789
What?

02:51.546 --> 02:52.582
Lunch is ready.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.551
<i>Will you look at that?</i>

02:58.762 --> 03:00.253
What kind of dog
chews through wood?

03:00.639 --> 03:01.880
Y'all are feeding him, right?

03:02.099 --> 03:03.556
Maybe he's teething.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.553
You know, when Billy was little,

03:04.768 --> 03:06.009
he chewed right through
his playpen.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.390
- No kidding?
- Only had three teeth.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.263
Mostly gummed it.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.432
So how y'all want to fix it?

03:12.651 --> 03:13.892
Well, I figure I'll patch it,

03:14.111 --> 03:15.568
run some chicken wire
along the bottom...

03:15.779 --> 03:17.736
that way, he don't
chew through it again.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.106
Hello.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.153
- Hey.
- Hey, Billy.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.820
Was this fence window
always here?

03:26.748 --> 03:29.331
No, son,
that's a new fence window.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.915
Anybody else getting dizzy?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.516
Why didn't you
call for help?

03:47.936 --> 03:50.019
I tried,
but no sound came out.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.596
You poor thing.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.101
It was very dirty up there.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.649
Is cleaning the garage
your job or Dad's?

03:55.861 --> 03:56.817
Don't you worry about that.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.485
Here, have some tea.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.904
- Chamomile?
- Yes.

04:00.115 --> 04:00.946
One teaspoon of honey?

04:01.324 --> 04:01.939
Yes.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.400
An ice cube to cool it off?

04:03.618 --> 04:04.859
I went with two today.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.115
You've been through enough.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.038
I prefer one ice cube.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.369
Drink it.

04:17.966 --> 04:18.797
It's nice when the kids
are in bed,

04:19.009 --> 04:21.000
and we can just
hang out and relax.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.554
I'm not even gonna
respond to that.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.716
I finally got him asleep.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.846
He's still pretty shook up.

04:30.061 --> 04:30.676
<i>Maybe having</i>

04:30.896 --> 04:32.808
this mutt next door
won't be so bad.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.480
Shelly could end up
getting used to it.

04:34.733 --> 04:35.769
That's true.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.020
Remember when he got
all freaked out

04:37.235 --> 04:38.942
by the fruit
at the bottom of yogurt?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.611
Now he eats it no problem.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.355
He still makes me stir it.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.234
<i>Maybe you
could start out</i>

04:43.450 --> 04:45.282
with a small pet,
and work your way up.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.200
Like a turtle.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.035
He says they carry salmonella.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.236
A gerbil?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.288
Apparently, they
caused the plague.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.365
What about a bird?

04:52.584 --> 04:53.574
Oh, I know that one.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.751
They'll steal his hair
to make a nest.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.719
Mom!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.351
<i>At least
this time, sound came out.</i>

05:17.275 --> 05:19.392
<i>I call that progress.</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:31.620
What's going on?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.243
Your dog got
into our house.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.448
How the hell did he do that?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.250
He pushed in a screen window.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.960
You think he chewed
through the fence again?

05:38.255 --> 05:38.870
All I know

05:39.089 --> 05:40.500
is Sheldon's yelling at the dog,

05:40.715 --> 05:42.081
and Mary's yelling at me.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.962
Now I'm looking at you
in your underwear.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.134
<i>Damn it, Herschel,
what is going on?</i>

05:46.429 --> 05:47.636
Oh, hey, George.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.554
Hey, Brenda.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.176
Bucky got in their house.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.135
That's funny.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.059
It might be funny one day,
not right now.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.560
Look, I'm real sorry, George.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.513
I'll keep him tied up,
it won't happen again.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.810
Y'all have a good night.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.731
<i>George!</i>

06:00.110 --> 06:02.227
You are not gonna
believe this. Look.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.028
Their dog left a dead squirrel
in our living room.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.448
Well, h-he is part hunting dog.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.945
I think that means he likes you.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.947
I'm not interested in
winning his affection.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.950
I'm interested in keeping dogs
and rodents outside of my home.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.372
<i>Well,
now, hold on.</i>

06:15.584 --> 06:16.620
How do we know it was
Bucky that left

06:16.835 --> 06:17.996
that squirrel
in your house?

06:18.253 --> 06:19.960
Maybe that squirrel
was already there.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.415
Why else would a dead squirrel
be in my living room?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.090
I don't know what kind
of house you keep.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.251
<i>My house</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:28.085
<i>is immaculate.</i>

06:28.305 --> 06:29.421
- George, tell them.
- Uh...

06:29.639 --> 06:31.380
She does keep a nice house.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.717
Honey, it's a pretty good chance
it was Bucky.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.801
- Whose side are you on?
- Yours, always yours.

06:36.021 --> 06:36.636
<i>All right.</i>

06:36.855 --> 06:38.016
Everyone's upset, it's late.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.434
Maybe we should drop
this for tonight?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.311
That's a good idea. Okay.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.900
You just keep your dog
away from my son.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.023
- There you go picking it up again.
- I am sorry,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.319
but their dog
broke into our home.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.612
Something he
probably learned

06:47.908 --> 06:48.614
from your brother.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.781
How dare you.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.201
Okay, I think that's
a good stopping point.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.994
<i>How do we know
that your son didn't</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:57.118
lure Bucky in to perform weird
science experiments on him?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.667
My son was asleep in his bed,
and you have some nerve...

07:02.130 --> 07:03.621
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.122
<i>Night, George!</i>

07:05.342 --> 07:06.173
Night!

07:11.514 --> 07:12.470
I don't understand
why that dog

07:12.682 --> 07:14.344
is so interested in Sheldon.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.676
Maybe Bucky likes the way
Sheldon smells?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.602
Your brother washes himself
three times a day.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.270
He has no smell.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.098
Animal control.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.478
Oh, no, no.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.935
No, you don't want
to go calling animal control.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.736
- Why not?
- Because,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.406
you have to live next door
to these people.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.406
They called the cops on Georgie
when he played music too loud.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.450
Maybe it was them,
maybe it was me.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.618
Anyway, the point is,

07:38.833 --> 07:39.914
<i>you don't can't
go throwing</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:41.287
gasoline on the fire.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.744
Well, they started this fire,

07:42.963 --> 07:44.420
and now,
they're gonna get burned.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.915
I believe you've had
enough coffee.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.005
Listen, why don't you
let me talk to Brenda,

07:50.220 --> 07:51.301
and just smooth things out?

07:51.513 --> 07:52.845
Why do you think
she'll listen to you?

07:53.056 --> 07:55.264
Because people like me
more than you.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.345
People like me.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.517
I didn't say they don't,
they just like me more.

07:59.938 --> 08:00.644
<i>Anyway,</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:02.096
<i>I see her all the
time at bowling.</i>

08:02.315 --> 08:03.726
I know how to handle her.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.266
Fine.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.851
Thank you.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.319
Plenty of people like me.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.532
Hey, Brenda, how's it going?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.960
Your daughter's a pain in
my ass, that's how it's going.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.626
You don't beat around the bush.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.128
I've always liked that
about you.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.174
Connie, I've had a long night.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.754
Unless you're looking to bowl,
I don't want to hear it.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.089
Aw, now, come on.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.807
Let me buy you a drink,
and we'll talk about this.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.472
I'm more on your side
than you think.

08:41.770 --> 08:42.635
Somehow,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.893
- I doubt that.
- It's true.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.438
Don't you think I realize
that Mary can be a bit...

08:48.653 --> 08:50.440
Of a self-righteous bitch?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.067
I was gonna say "challenging,"
but sure, let's go with yours.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.281
It's got a nice rhythm.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.610
Mmm.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.116
Brenda, this is, by far,

09:00.331 --> 09:02.618
the best bowling alley
margarita in town.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.325
How long

09:04.544 --> 09:06.331
you and Herschel been married?
18, 19 years?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.378
19, but it feels like 30.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.253
Well,
y'all are a great couple.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.208
Eh.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.043
I just wanted to thank you

09:14.262 --> 09:16.800
for being so patient and kind
to my daughter and her family

09:17.015 --> 09:18.005
since they moved in.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.802
- It's nothing.
- No,

09:20.018 --> 09:21.475
it needs to be said.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.474
You know, Mary has a tough job
raising those three kids,

09:24.689 --> 09:27.898
with one of them being,
you know, somewhat special.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.645
- I can see that.
- Yeah.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.237
And having a kind neighbor makes
all the difference in the world.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.438
Well, we try.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.741
And I know you know
how stressful it is,

09:37.952 --> 09:39.739
seeing as how you have
your own child

09:39.954 --> 09:42.697
who is special in his own way.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.414
What's that supposed to mean?

09:45.126 --> 09:48.619
Well, I mean, hey, I know
Billy is a terrific little boy,

09:48.838 --> 09:51.831
but I am sure he has presented
you and Herschel

09:52.050 --> 09:53.541
with some challenges.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.881
If there's a weird kid
in the neighborhood,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.587
it's your grandson.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.890
Now, hang on, I said
"special," not "weird."

10:01.101 --> 10:02.137
I heard you.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.388
I said "weird."

10:04.062 --> 10:05.052
Okay, see now, Brenda,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.058
you don't want to go calling
my grandson weird

10:07.273 --> 10:09.765
when I've just treated you
to a margarita <i>grande.</i>

10:09.984 --> 10:12.146
Well, I'm sorry,
but you shouldn't be inferring

10:12.362 --> 10:14.194
there's something wrong
with my Billy.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.237
Darlin', there's no inferring.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.156
I've seen the boy
sitting in the dirt

10:18.368 --> 10:20.610
eating his own
belly button lint.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.958
Really, Mom? This is how
you put out the fire?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.335
Well, at least she got
the worst of it.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.666
How you figure that?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.797
I ripped a big patch of hair
out of her head.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.429
This will be healed in a week.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.348
She will be wearing a hat
till Labor Day.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.601
I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.054
- No, you don't.
- Pick again.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.983
Excuse me, Ms. Hutchins?

11:01.202 --> 11:01.942
Hey, Sheldon.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.779
Can you recommend any books
on overcoming phobias?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.115
That's in the self-help section.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.666
Follow me, I have read them all.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.870
- Any phobia in particular?
- Dogs.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.456
Ah, cynophobia.
That's a good one.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.712
Did you know there's
over 50 million dogs

11:17.927 --> 11:19.634
just in the United States alone?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.508
That's 50 million
too many.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.636
Here. I read this one to help
with my haphephobia.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.723
Ah, fear of being touched.
I have that, too. Was it useful?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.352
Well, when someone's
interested in touching me,

11:32.567 --> 11:33.603
we'll find out.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.903
<i>The basic premise</i>

11:38.114 --> 11:39.730
<i>of the book was that phobias</i>

11:39.949 --> 11:42.032
<i>were overcome by taking
incremental steps</i>

11:42.243 --> 11:44.485
<i>toward confronting
the phobia in question.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:47.822
<i>In my case, that started
with watching a TV show</i>

11:48.041 --> 11:50.328
<i>that was adored by children
around the world,</i>

11:50.543 --> 11:53.627
<i>but for me,
was the stuff of nightmares.</i>

11:53.963 --> 11:55.579
<i>Scooby-Doo!</i>

11:57.133 --> 11:59.500
<i>The next step
was to go face-to-face</i>

11:59.719 --> 12:01.176
<i>with real dogs.</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:04.300
<i>Albeit through
a plate-glass window.</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:06.385
Okay, that's enough.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.637
<i>And finally,</i>

12:07.852 --> 12:10.344
<i>a close encounter
of the third kind,</i>

12:10.563 --> 12:14.182
<i>physical contact with a member
of the canine species.</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:17.108
Hello, I'd like to speak
with the veterinarian.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.861
Well, I was hoping
you might have one or two dogs

12:20.073 --> 12:22.690
under anesthesia that
I might come by and pet.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.525
Sure, I'll hold.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.784
Who are you talking to?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.912
The Medford Veterinary Clinic.

12:29.165 --> 12:29.996
Why?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.870
I'm trying to overcome
my fear of dogs

12:32.085 --> 12:33.872
before it affects
our family any further.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.330
Oh, honey, you don't have to
worry about how it affects us.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.086
Meemaw got punched
in the face because of me.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.090
No, that wasn't because of you,
and for the record,

12:44.305 --> 12:46.342
your meemaw gets punched
in the face all the time.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.760
Well, I still think
I need to take

12:47.976 --> 12:49.638
some sort of positive action.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.184
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, hello?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.811
Oh, that's too bad.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.766
How about a small fluffy one
that's recently died of old age?

12:56.985 --> 12:57.600
Enough.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.066
Sorry.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.704
<i>Now, it says here
in Mark 12:31</i>

13:10.915 --> 13:12.622
that you should
"Love your neighbor

13:12.834 --> 13:13.824
as yourself."

13:14.043 --> 13:17.252
Anybody like to take a guess
what that means? Missy?

13:17.463 --> 13:20.171
It means to be nice to
the people who live next door.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.419
That's right.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.125
But everybody else
can go to hell.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.007
Okay, Missy, we don't use
that kind of language here.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.181
And if you think about it,
in this world,

13:29.392 --> 13:32.510
with all the ways we can travel,
everybody's your neighbor.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.094
Yes, Sheldon.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.596
How do we love
our neighbors

13:35.815 --> 13:37.181
when our moms hate each other?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.483
- Who does your mom hate?
- Your mom.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.311
Hey, my mom hates your mom.
Small world.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.146
Okay, let's hang on a second.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.947
My mom also hates
their grandma.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.445
'Cause she lost a fight to her.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.031
Nuh-uh, she won. She said so.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.283
All right, stop. Let's stop.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.285
Now this might be hard
to understand,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.366
but living a loving,
Christian life

13:56.586 --> 13:58.794
isn't always
the easiest thing to do.

14:00.798 --> 14:01.504
Yes, Billy.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.924
My mom's not crazy
about you either.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.804
Just love your neighbor, 'kay?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.182
<i>Now, I am more than
willing to look the other way</i>

14:12.393 --> 14:14.555
when my parishioners don't
get along with each other.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.429
That sort of thing happens,
but when it becomes a problem

14:17.648 --> 14:19.890
for the children,
then I have to intervene.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.188
There's no
problem here,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.486
other than these two thinking
that they're better than me.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.938
I don't think it, I know it.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.489
I gave your mother
a good smacking.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.531
I can give you one, too.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.030
That's big talk from somebody
with a comb-over.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.281
<i>Ladies.</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:34.409
Do I need to remind you
that we are Christians?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.199
In all our behavior,
in all our actions,

14:37.418 --> 14:40.081
we must constantly
ask ourselves the question,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.037
"What would Jesus do?"

14:42.382 --> 14:43.168
Can I say something?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.585
Would Jesus say it?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.508
Never mind.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.512
<i>In my life, I've often</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:53.215
<i>been accused of being
a physical coward,</i>

14:54.060 --> 14:57.474
<i>and for the most part,
those accusations are correct.</i>

14:59.107 --> 15:02.851
<i>But there have been times
when I've shown great courage.</i>

15:04.153 --> 15:05.018
<i>This was one of them.</i>

15:06.239 --> 15:07.446
Hello, Bucky.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.451
Are you a good dog?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.410
Please be a good dog.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.500
Please.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.294
<i>Now oftentimes,
when we don't like someone,</i>

15:23.506 --> 15:25.543
what's happening is
we see something in them

15:25.758 --> 15:27.340
that we don't like in ourselves.

15:27.885 --> 15:28.841
What are you saying?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.965
Really? That was
over your head?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.796
I'm saying,

15:33.474 --> 15:35.591
y'all might have more in common
than you think.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.927
Well, don't say
both their kids are "special."

15:38.271 --> 15:40.479
She does not
like that.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.020
<i>Okay.</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:46.772
Here we go.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.023
Petting... the dog.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.457
I'm doing it.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.043
<i>I'm petting a dog.</i>

16:12.430 --> 16:14.217
I've conquered my phobia.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.057
<i>You're a good boy.
Yes, you are.</i>

16:21.022 --> 16:23.309
I'm sorry for the unkind things
I said to you.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.562
Me, too.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.485
Connie?

16:30.656 --> 16:31.271
What?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.361
Anything you'd like to say?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.158
Not particularly.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.486
Mom.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.196
Okay.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.783
I'm sorry for the things I said,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.871
and, you know, what happened
at the bowling alley.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.002
As am I.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.297
Here.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.428
I think this came out
of your head.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.927
He licked me! He licked me!

17:02.146 --> 17:03.557
<i>The dog licked
my tongue!</i>

17:03.773 --> 17:05.263
I can still taste it!

17:05.483 --> 17:08.442
<i>Call 911!</i>

17:09.987 --> 17:11.853
I think Jesus
might go check that out.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.318
How's it going in there, baby?

17:18.538 --> 17:22.031
<i>Okay, but we're
gonna need more Listerine.</i>

17:25.377 --> 17:28.290
I'm proud of him for trying to
overcome that damn dog phobia.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.959
You should tell him that.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.375
Well, if he ever leaves
that bathroom, I will.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.086
What I can't figure out is why
that dog is so drawn to Sheldon.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.295
Beats me.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.056
- You say his owner's in the slammer?
- Yeah.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.183
Wonder what kind of fella he is.

18:06.836 --> 18:07.997
It's a mystery.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.538
I guess we'll
never know.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.587
<i>Hey, Moonpie.</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:21.506
I got you a little something
to help you

18:21.726 --> 18:23.763
get over your fear of animals.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.677
A tranquilizer gun?

18:26.397 --> 18:27.638
A pet fish.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.728
Why?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.608
Well, I thought you could
start small

18:35.823 --> 18:36.904
and then work your way up.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.865
<i>Look, he's
kind of cute.</i>

18:40.161 --> 18:44.451
He doesn't even care
that I'm here. I like him.

18:45.875 --> 18:46.956
What are you
gonna name him?

18:47.585 --> 18:48.371
Fish.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.500
Fish?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.003
I'm not ready to get attached.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.082
Fish are kind of boring.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.250
I know, isn't it great?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.052
But you can't
even pet 'em.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.300
Maybe we can.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.595
Baby, what's wrong?

19:04.810 --> 19:08.429
I tried to pet Fish!
Ah, he was so slimy!

19:08.773 --> 19:10.685
Well, yeah, he's a fish.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.189
I put my finger in the top
of the tank, then I touched him,

19:14.403 --> 19:15.314
and he bit me!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.065
Oh, I'm sure he didn't bite you.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.271
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

19:18.491 --> 19:21.575
His fish blood is mixing
with my human blood.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.778
- Maybe he was just trying to give you a kiss.
- No.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.034
He hates me. I never
want to see him again.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.785
Oh, Sheldon,
you're being silly.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.458
Fish like this don't bite.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.208
Look. See?
He's harmless.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.789
Son of a bitch!

19:36.300 --> 19:37.632
Dad killed my fish!

19:37.843 --> 19:38.708
George!

19:39.095 --> 19:40.302
He'll be fine.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.304
Just got to put him
back in the bowl.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.175
Oh, George.
