"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:03.671 --> 00:06.240
- Did you guys have to work,
or did you get to have fun?

00:06.274 --> 00:08.142
- I'm, like, really not trying
to be a bitch.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.477
It's just, like,
the conversation--

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
it just makes me
uncomfortable.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.447
- [laughs]

00:13.481 --> 00:14.748
I interrupted her
and said,

00:14.782 --> 00:18.586
"You talking to me makes me
really uncomfortable."

00:18.619 --> 00:19.887
- You've been throwing rocks.
- Why?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.222
Because I call you,
like, a whore?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.590
Like, I was just sitting here
with someone

00:22.623 --> 00:24.825
pretending that they haven't
had a married boyfriend.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.161
- I don't have
a married boyfriend.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.730
- I want to do
a birthday trip in Montauk.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.133
- Fun.
both: To Montauk.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.234
- Whoo!

00:33.267 --> 00:34.935
[siren blips]

00:34.968 --> 00:35.969
- What do we do:

00:36.003 --> 00:37.138
stand up,

00:37.171 --> 00:39.207
or do we fear
for our safety

00:39.240 --> 00:41.242
and close down and capitulate?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.377
What happened in Orlando...

00:43.411 --> 00:44.578
- It's just so sad.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.815
- Was a heinous act
of terrorism.

- Hi.
- Hi, Bubbles.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.894
- I found this
little flower outside.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.062
- Did you bring it to me?

01:35.163 --> 01:36.664
- I did.
- Aw.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.366
- Another day another dollar.

[laughter]

01:39.400 --> 01:40.701
What are you guys up to?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.504
- You know, just doing
our favorite stuff here.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.672
How was Sunday?

01:44.705 --> 01:46.574
- Yeah, how was pride?
- I was kind of worried,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.909
but everybody seemed to be,
like, in good spirits

01:48.942 --> 01:51.011
and still wanting
to celebrate.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.346

- Who wants shots?

01:52.380 --> 01:55.048
[all cheering]

01:55.082 --> 01:56.284
- As much as I would love

01:56.317 --> 01:59.320
to put on a happy face,
I was just literally sad.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.455
I did get a text message
from Nathalie saying,

02:01.489 --> 02:03.191
"If Lisa's here,
you should be too."

02:03.224 --> 02:05.293
But Lisa said
we didn't have to be

02:05.326 --> 02:06.894
if we didn't feel comfortable.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.298
And I just couldn't be pouring
drinks down people's throats.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.400
- Did you find out anything
about what Ariana's doing

02:12.433 --> 02:15.603
for her birthday?
- We're going to Sonoma.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.638
We might be going to,
like, NASCAR or something.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.672
- Who's all going?

02:18.706 --> 02:20.474
- They said that
they did invite Lala,

02:20.508 --> 02:22.943
so I'll just have to deal
with that I guess.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.778
- Ariana knows I've already
been invited

02:24.812 --> 02:26.380
to Stassi's birthday,

02:26.414 --> 02:27.781
and I've accepted
the invitation,

02:27.815 --> 02:29.783
so I'm assuming
that's one of the reasons,

02:29.817 --> 02:32.753
if not the only reason, that she
hasn't invited me to hers yet.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.255
I'm just texting
with Kristen.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.557
We finally got a house.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.025
For the party in two days.
- Yeah.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.793
- It's a pool party, right?
- Yes.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.994
- Are we gonna be like,
"Surprise?"

02:41.028 --> 02:42.430
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.265
Kristen's boyfriend
Carter thinks

02:44.298 --> 02:45.899
he's going to Shay's
surprise party,

02:45.933 --> 02:48.236
and Shay thinks he's going
to Carter's surprise party,

02:48.236 --> 02:49.803
so when they show up
and see it's both

02:49.837 --> 02:51.405
of their surprise parties
it's like, "Ha!

02:51.439 --> 02:52.640
Surprise!"

02:52.673 --> 02:55.042
I'll sneak out
and then come say hi to you.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.845
- Yeah. Maybe we can
sneak a shot or something.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.419

03:05.453 --> 03:06.687
I'm sorry.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.390
I'm just, like, very picky.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.391
What is this?
- Hi!

03:10.424 --> 03:12.426
- Oh, my gosh.
How are you?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.127
- So good to see you.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.364
You look so chic dressed--
- No. You look fabulous.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.498
As always.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.166
- I was here 'cause--
is Brittany working?

03:19.267 --> 03:20.301
- I think she is.
Yeah.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.569
- So I just wanted
to ask her something.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.371
- Let me send you Brittany.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.274
- When I used to work at
Sur I hated Sur,

03:26.274 --> 03:28.442
but now that I can come in
as a customer

03:28.476 --> 03:30.010
it's my absolute favorite.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.380
I am ride or f---ing die

03:32.413 --> 03:35.483
with those goat cheese balls
and my white wine.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.650
- Hey, girl.
Hey.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.885
[laughter]
- Hi.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.353
I feel like
I'm stalking you.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.422
I'm, like,
coming into your work

03:41.455 --> 03:42.723
and be like,
"Is Brittany here?"

03:42.756 --> 03:44.725
- What's up?
- I wanted to ask you something,

03:44.758 --> 03:47.861
because I thought
of an idea for my podcast.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.764
I've been doing a podcast called
"Straight Up with Stassi."

03:50.798 --> 03:51.999
We're back again.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.667
Another week.
We're drinking.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.970
What I wanted is for women
to feel like

03:57.004 --> 03:59.973
they're sitting around
with their best girlfriends

04:00.007 --> 04:02.576
drinking wine,
talking about things

04:02.610 --> 04:04.312
that they're too scared
to say in public.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.348
So I have an "ask Stassi"
themed episode,

04:07.381 --> 04:10.684
and so many questions are always
about their boyfriends.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.987
And so I figured it would be
a really good idea to have Jax,

04:14.021 --> 04:15.556
now that he's reformed,

04:15.589 --> 04:18.626
the reformed bad boyfriend.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.562
Answer, like, "How do you
get away with cheating?

04:21.595 --> 04:23.597
Tell us exactly
what dudes do."

04:23.631 --> 04:26.600
I feel like it's right
to ask you permission first,

04:26.634 --> 04:29.136
because it's your boyfriend.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.639
- We're gonna talk about
how big of a piece of sh--

04:31.672 --> 04:33.707
he was and how I changed him?

04:33.741 --> 04:34.908
[laughs]
- Well, that is a--

04:34.942 --> 04:36.710
Well, listen.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.346
You are actually the one
that changed him.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.047
- So it'll be,
like, a positive?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.815
- It's a positive thing.
- No.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.817
That sounds--
I'm fine with it.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.453
I promise.
- Thank you so much.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.955
- I don't like to dwell on
the past when it comes to Jax.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.991
From what I hear,
he was a real piece of sh--

04:51.024 --> 04:52.426
in his days.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.462
- I did go to Vegas and have
relations with somebody else.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.796
Yes, we slept together.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.797
- F--- you.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.265
- You came twice, sweetheart.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.634
- But I'm actually fine with
Jax doing this podcast,

05:00.668 --> 05:04.104
because the only thing
Stassi's horrible ex-boyfriend

05:04.137 --> 05:07.174
and the man that I know and love
have in common

05:07.207 --> 05:08.876
is that his name is Jax Taylor.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.778
- Can I order goat cheese balls
on a chopped salad?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.779
- Okay.
Be right back.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.813
- Thank you.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.584
- Bam.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.886
- Thank you. Oh, my gosh.
- You're welcome.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.454
I'm gonna go drop these off.

05:20.488 --> 05:25.393
- Oh, do you mind maybe
if you could grab Katie,

05:25.393 --> 05:28.496
and we can talk about
something in the back?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.663
- Okay.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.664
- It's not bad.
It's nothing bad.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.799
- Sure?
- I know it's weird.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.667
Earlier this week Lisa told me

05:33.701 --> 05:37.170
I should try to get Scheana
and Katie together with Lala.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.539
- Well, why don't you
initiate that?

05:38.572 --> 05:39.707
You're in the middle.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.974
Why don't you put them
together and say,

05:41.008 --> 05:43.076
"Listen, if you can
find your way back to it,

05:43.110 --> 05:44.512
you would probably
like each other?"

05:44.545 --> 05:46.714
- None of these girls
are blameless,

05:46.747 --> 05:49.316
so there's no reason
why we can't move on.

05:49.417 --> 05:52.420
*

05:52.420 --> 05:54.455
- Ariana needs to speak to us
in the back alley.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.223
Can you take a minute?

05:56.256 --> 05:59.427
- They're, like, resetting
the table, so yeah. Okay.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.433
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.601
- Are those the same boots?
- No.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.738
They're similar.
Are we having a meeting?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.440
- I know that there's
some conflict

06:12.473 --> 06:14.207
with you guys and Lala,

06:14.241 --> 06:15.776
and Lisa suggested

06:15.809 --> 06:18.111
that I get everybody together
for a conversation,

06:18.145 --> 06:21.449
so I was thinking maybe
you guys would be open to that.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.017
- About what?
- I mean--

06:24.051 --> 06:26.454
- Like, to clear up rumors
that are true or--

06:26.454 --> 06:28.756
- You know.
All of the married man stuff.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.658
- Like, okay. That's fine.
- Yeah?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.093
- I mean I don't have, like,
a lot of time, but yeah.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
I don't know what the f---

06:34.462 --> 06:36.697
Ariana is doing with trying
to broker this, like,

06:36.730 --> 06:39.467
peace treaty between myself
and Scheana and Lala.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.836
I just, like--we don't have,
like, four hours to chitchat.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.104
As far as I'm concerned,

06:44.137 --> 06:46.339
there are no more chances
with Lala.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.342
She has called me disgusting.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.278
She wants to f--- my fiancé.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.246
She thinks he has
the biggest dick.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.115
That for sure
we're gonna get divorced,

06:55.148 --> 06:57.485
and when Tom is
finally done with me

06:57.485 --> 06:59.553
she has a really cute girl
she can hook him up with.

06:59.587 --> 07:04.191
- Okay, so how can
we make things peaceful

07:04.224 --> 07:05.893
so things can be cool
at work?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.928
- I extended
an apology to you,

07:07.961 --> 07:10.931
and then when I tried
to start somewhat

07:10.964 --> 07:13.667
of a conversation,
I got shut down.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.236
- I wasn't ready to have
a conversation with you.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.339
- So you felt like
you needed more time?

07:19.372 --> 07:23.844
- Or just for her to be
in a better space.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.079
- Don't worry about me.
It's not about me.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.048
- Kate, when you walk into
a room, and you

07:28.081 --> 07:29.950
and I don't even look
at each other--

07:29.983 --> 07:32.252
- I know that there are
some things

07:32.285 --> 07:34.354
that have been
going around.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.690
You know,
all the married man rumors,

07:36.724 --> 07:38.959
so are they saying
stuff about her?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.694
- Yeah. Lala.
She was like, "Oh, my God.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.429
So this guy, his wife found

07:42.530 --> 07:44.364
a video of us
having sex on his phone."

07:44.397 --> 07:46.133
- You guys are f---ing out
of your minds.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.235
- This was my theory,
like, from the get-go

07:48.268 --> 07:50.203
with you is that
I just don't--I don't trust you.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.641
- Well, yeah. I was trying
to cover up dating the guy

07:53.674 --> 07:55.643
I have--I guess

07:55.676 --> 07:57.878
ex as of yesterday morning,

07:57.911 --> 08:00.581
because I just didn't want to
talk about it, and I felt like,

08:00.614 --> 08:03.551
"Oh, this is, like,
a little, fun acting game."

08:03.551 --> 08:05.886
- Oh, well, isn't that
just convenient

08:05.919 --> 08:07.387
that your fake boyfriend

08:07.420 --> 08:09.657
that you made up
to cover up the actual guy

08:09.690 --> 08:12.225
you're seeing just broke up
with you yesterday.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.194
- There's been trashing
on both sides.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.596
What you--
- I've already apologized.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.130
I'm not apologizing anymore.
- Yeah.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.666
You apologized,
for what it was worth.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.133
- What, do I need to, like,
finger you

08:20.167 --> 08:21.735
to make you, like, forget?

08:21.769 --> 08:22.836
Like, what is wrong with you?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.471
- What is wrong with you?
- God.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.607
- Okay, so--
- Well, it's like God damn.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.742
You're, like--there's
so much aggression.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.878
- It's very frustrating for me,
because I am,

08:30.911 --> 08:34.615
like, fully on board
100% team Katie.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.450
However, now that Ariana
and I are close again,

08:37.484 --> 08:39.486
we want everyone to get along.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.354
I don't know what to do.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.959
Well, that all
makes sense now,

08:45.993 --> 08:49.730
so I'm dropping anything

08:49.763 --> 08:52.065
I've been talking about you,
'cause it's not my business.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.434
It never should have
came out of my mouth,

08:54.467 --> 08:56.269
so I will apologize for anything

08:56.303 --> 08:57.905
I've said about you
that was untrue.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.108
- That's fine.
- I don't know what the f---

09:01.141 --> 09:03.811
this, like, weird
wish-washy apology is about.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.713
Like, have a little,
like, integrity.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.750
- So yes and yes.
Yes and yes.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.351
- I think we've had
the world's longest break,

09:11.384 --> 09:12.853
and I can't believe
we're not in trouble yet, so--

09:12.886 --> 09:14.187
- We walk in the door.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.188
They're like, "You're fired."

09:15.222 --> 09:16.356
[laughter]

09:20.060 --> 09:23.030
- Can I order another order
of goat cheese balls, but to go?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.098
- To go goat cheese balls?
- Yeah. To go.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.401
- Okay. I'm not judging.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.436
- It feels like you are.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.675
- Hey, Brooke,
how many do you have?

09:34.708 --> 09:35.809
- 263.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.210
- It's early week.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.947
No. That's good.
Okay.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.314
Hey.
- Hi, Lisa.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.983
- Do you know what
the special is tonight?

09:43.016 --> 09:46.086
- Yeah.
We have an Alaskan halibut

09:46.119 --> 09:49.923
with a stuffed Portobello
mushroom with mozzarella.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.492
- Is that how you say it, or do
you try and sell it, like--

09:52.525 --> 09:55.195
- Try to sell it.
- Is there anything else?

09:55.228 --> 09:56.764
- Did you see
Stassi's here today?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.365
- No. What?
Having dinner again?

10:01.702 --> 10:02.703
- [laughs]

10:02.736 --> 10:04.004
- Well, she came in
to talk to me,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.873
'cause you know
how she's doing that podcast?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.307
- No.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.776
- Well she has, like, a podcast,
and she does it, like, twice--

10:08.809 --> 10:10.844
- What has she got to say
that she hasn't said already?

10:10.878 --> 10:14.281
- Well, she came to ask
my permission to have Jax on it.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.650
- And you gave your permission?
- Yeah. I said it was okay.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.320
- And why would you do that?
- 'Cause I think it's okay.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.621
- Is it okay, Brittany?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.124
Even when Brittany's really
pissed off,

10:24.157 --> 10:27.661
she's smiling from ear to ear
like she's in a beauty pageant.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.196
Where's your pissed off face?

10:29.229 --> 10:32.132
- What would you do
if you were in my situation?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.434
- I would tell somebody
to back the f--- off.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.004
He's your man,
and that's it.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.672
But then I've been
married 34 years.

10:38.706 --> 10:42.375
Maybe that's what's kept me
married for 34 years.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.844
I don't know.
- Okay.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.379
I just want to see how it goes.
I think it'll be okay.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.082
- I just don't want anybody
walking all over you.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.919
- Right.
- So don't ask my advice

10:51.952 --> 10:53.486
unless you're gonna take it.
- Okay.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.724
Well, I'm gonna walk back
to the pink room, okay?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.058
Good to see you.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.126
- All right.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.998
- I'll be right back
with the those. Stay here.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.566
- I transferred
table six to Tierney,

11:06.599 --> 11:08.936
'cause she's the closer, and
the rest of my tables are done.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.470
- Cool. Everything good?
- So I'm gonna go home.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.272
- Okay.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.142
[ice rattling]

11:15.175 --> 11:16.243
- Hi.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.778
- Hey.
- Wait.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.812
I haven't sat out here

11:18.846 --> 11:20.280
at this table
in a really long time.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.050
- It would have been really
great to have a mediator today.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.818
Yeah. Scheana comes up to me,
and she's like,

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
"Ariana wants to talk
to us out back."

11:26.386 --> 11:28.355
She's like, "Well,
you know, I was talking to Lala,

11:28.388 --> 11:30.290
and she said that she wanted
to talk to you both

11:30.323 --> 11:31.892
to, like, clear the air."

11:31.925 --> 11:34.094
I'm like, "I'm sorry that, like,
I brought this stuff up.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.095
You heard--"

11:35.128 --> 11:36.997
- You're sorry?
- Well--

11:37.030 --> 11:39.132
- Did you say, "I'm sorry
that I brought this stuff up?"

11:39.166 --> 11:41.401
- Well, Scheana more
or less apologized about that.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.803
No.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.074
- What?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.976
Did Scheana have a stroke?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.577
Scheana apologized to Lala?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.847
- She said, "I apologize."
- What did she apologize for?

11:53.881 --> 11:56.784
- For, like, for perpetuating.
Talking about this.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.819
- She's so desperate
to be liked all of the time.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.522
Can I get out my phone
and type what the actual f---?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.858
I am texting her right now.
I'm sorry. I can't not.

12:04.892 --> 12:08.161
Scheana apologizing
to Lala is like

12:08.195 --> 12:11.799
one of the victims apologizing
to Charles Manson.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.234
"She had another story.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.535
I don't know what to believe,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.170
so I just said, 'Okay, well,

12:17.204 --> 12:19.639
then I will apologize
for anything untrue I said.'"

12:19.672 --> 12:22.142
What about your sources?
You came to us with all the--

12:22.175 --> 12:23.210
- I don't--
- I have to put this

12:23.243 --> 12:24.812
in capital letters
like a psychopath.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.980
- I have to get back in there.
I'll text you later.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.049
- Okay.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.383
- Coming up...

12:30.417 --> 12:32.552
- I feel like I can't have
an opinion anymore,

12:32.585 --> 12:33.854
because it's wrong.
- You can't.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.555
It's been like this
for years.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.858
It's almost like they're
going back to their old ways.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.567
*

12:47.600 --> 12:49.669
- Look how long this is.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.138
It won't fit.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.840
- There has to be a way, though.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.109
Just screw your ball back on.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.445
Oh, it has a screw thing.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.546
Look.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.848
Voilà.
[metallic clattering]

13:00.881 --> 13:02.515
- Oh.
Oh.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.417
If I put my mind to it, yes,

13:04.451 --> 13:05.953
I consider myself
a handy person.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.720
- Please don't fall.
You're worrying me.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.990
- But I'm not a big fan
of hanging drapes,

13:10.023 --> 13:12.759
putting together furniture,
hanging pictures.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.327
I'd rather just hire
someone to do it.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.196
- Good job.
I'm proud of you.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.197
- I need a drink.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.465
- I'll make you a drink.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.967
- I have to go
do Stassi's podcast.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.234
I probably
should have a drink.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.369
She's got some kind of, like,

13:22.402 --> 13:23.703
layout that
she wants me to do.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.907
It's kind of, like,
called a reformed boyfriend.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.375
- I know. Trust me.
She came up and asked me

13:28.408 --> 13:31.111
if it was okay
before she asked you.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
- Why wouldn't it be okay?
- Well, she just--

13:33.346 --> 13:34.481
it was being respectful.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.084
I mean that is
your ex-girlfriend.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.651
- I was like a child
when I dated her.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.453
- Watch out, honey.
You're on top of the curtains.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.355
I trust Jax and I trust Stassi,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.992
but they're gonna be
talking about personal things,

13:45.025 --> 13:47.027
so it is a little bit weird.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.062
- I don't understand
why you have this, like, sense

13:49.096 --> 13:51.498
in your head that you think
I still like Stassi.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.799
- It's just--I mean any girl--

13:52.900 --> 13:55.068
what girl wouldn't feel
just a little jealous?

13:55.102 --> 13:57.770
- I know, but honestly,
honestly, I want you to know,

13:57.804 --> 14:00.140
like,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.475
even if you weren't around,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.711
it would never, never,
never happen.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.147
When I think back about
my relationship with Stassi

14:07.180 --> 14:10.017
I'm kind of reminded
of that movie "Misery."

14:10.050 --> 14:12.819
- I am the devil,
and don't you forget it.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.787
Grow up.
Grow up.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.224
You're a good boyfriend
70% of the time.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.961
But then the other 30%,
you're absolute sh--.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.263
- I just like being cordial
with her, because it's safer.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.264
- Yeah.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.698
[knock at door]
Come in.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.301
- Hi. Hey.
- Oh, my God.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.037
- Look at his little cone.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.372
- Look at you.
What are you drinking?

14:32.405 --> 14:33.606
- A vodka soda.
Do you want one?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.508
- Yes, please.
- It's like a mango orange.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.944
Is that okay?
- Yeah. That sounds good.

14:36.944 --> 14:40.180
Anything to get my head away
from my night and morning.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.482
When Shay quit drinking
I did as well,

14:42.515 --> 14:45.652
but today
I need a f---ing drink.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.955
- So what happened last night?
- Ariana asked me

14:47.955 --> 14:49.656
if I could grab Katie,
and she's like,

14:49.689 --> 14:52.792
"You know, Lala has been wanting
to clear the air with you two."

14:52.825 --> 14:54.394
And I'm like,
"Let's hear her out."

14:54.427 --> 14:57.164
So, dude, like, Lala swears

14:57.197 --> 14:59.766
that this married man
relationship isn't true.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.202
So let's just say
everyone's lying,

15:02.235 --> 15:03.536
and she's telling the truth.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.072
Let's just say that,
and I said, "You know what?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.474
I will apologize then
for anything untrue

15:07.507 --> 15:08.775
I've said about you."

15:08.808 --> 15:10.343
And then Katie goes
and tells Stassi.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.979
Then Stassi starts texting me.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.380
"Tell me you didn't
apologize to Lala."

15:13.413 --> 15:14.747
And then at midnight,

15:14.781 --> 15:16.249
I don't know how many drinks
in probably,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.585
I get a passive aggressive
text from Katie.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.388
But Katie's words exactly
were "I repulsed her."

15:21.421 --> 15:24.657
But what pisses me off
is yesterday,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.559
if I repulsed you, why the f---

15:26.593 --> 15:27.995
didn't you speak up right then

15:28.028 --> 15:29.396
and be like,
"Seriously, Scheana?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.998
Why the f---
are you apologizing to her?"

15:31.031 --> 15:33.433
When I left Sur last night
Katie wasn't mad at me at all,

15:33.466 --> 15:36.003
so what happened between
6:00 and midnight?

15:36.003 --> 15:40.007
My guess is Stassi Schroeder
and probably some tequila.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.141
I'm trying to be like,

15:41.174 --> 15:42.509
"Look, you guys,
can we just let this sh-- go?"

15:42.542 --> 15:44.677
"No. She's a whore.
She's a slut. She's--"

15:44.711 --> 15:48.081
I'm like, "The three
of you think the same."

15:48.115 --> 15:51.551
[upbeat music]

15:51.584 --> 15:53.820
- We can just go over real quick
the additional expenses

15:53.853 --> 15:55.688
that you're going to have,

15:55.722 --> 15:57.224
so we will have the shuttle,

15:57.257 --> 15:59.692
I'm gonna estimate
around $1,000 for that.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.860
- Okay.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.299
- Yeah.
I think that'd be nice.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.334
- But not necessary.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.568
- And then...

16:11.071 --> 16:14.474
- I mean, keeping
the number as low as possible.

16:14.507 --> 16:18.911
I mean we wanted to keep
with under, like, 50.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.580
- What?
- Keep it under 50.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.681
- Thousand?
- Yeah.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.150
- What the f---?
- I know,

16:23.183 --> 16:25.118
but we're not even there yet,
so we're doing good.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.586
- 50?
No. 25.

16:26.619 --> 16:30.923
- I would probably say around,
like, the $24,000.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.292
- You just doubled our budget.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.761
Our budget for this wedding
is sort of like

16:34.794 --> 16:36.829
one of those
old cartoon snowballs.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.531
You know, it starts
really small.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.333
It's going down the hill
and getting bigger and bigger.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.868
And now it's out of control.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.136
You just doubled it.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.472
- This was before
we even knew--Tom, okay.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.539
Sorry, Trisha.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.477
- If it gets up to, like, 50,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.079
I'm not going to be able
to enjoy the wedding.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.880
- No. It's not.
Dude, Google it.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.816
That's how I found out
what things were gonna cost.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.318
- Thanks, Trisha. Bye.
- Bye.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.752
- I'm not cheap.
- Yeah, you are.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.088
- Dude, we're not--

17:01.088 --> 17:02.489
you just sprung that
on me out of the blue.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.391
- I said "under 50."

17:04.424 --> 17:06.259
- So actually it doesn't
even matter,

17:06.293 --> 17:08.228
so stop getting your panties
in a twist.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.363
- I don't really even believe
that Tom is a cheapskate,

17:10.397 --> 17:12.932
because if he was,
he would be out there trying

17:12.965 --> 17:15.368
to find the cheapest options
to give me what I want,

17:15.402 --> 17:17.537
so he's just
straight up disinterested.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.638
- That was the longest
conversation

17:18.671 --> 17:19.739
I've ever sat in on.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.408
I feel like I'm, like,
a tad older now.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.876
- Yeah. I just aged, like, five
years when she said "50 grand."

17:23.910 --> 17:25.112
- Hi!

17:25.145 --> 17:26.246
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.115
- The little, baby
mini purse is so cute.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.717
- No, you guys
look all cute today.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.152
- Thanks.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.188
- What do you want?
Beer or water?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.556
That's all we have.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.226
- I'll give you one guess.
- Thanks, Bub.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.128
- Kristen, don't you want to
know why you're here right now?

17:41.128 --> 17:43.130
[laughs]
- So--

17:43.130 --> 17:44.664
- You guys are
freaking me out right now.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.499
- We wanted to text you
about this last night,

17:46.533 --> 17:48.135
but we figured
it was better in person.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.536
- Lala last night.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.971
She wanted to explain to us,
like, she had had a boyfriend,

17:52.004 --> 17:53.440
and she was trying
to protect him,

17:53.473 --> 17:56.042
so she had, like,
decoy boyfriends?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.010
- Decoy boyfriends,
so married decoy boyfriends.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.612
- After some time goes by,
Scheana's like,

17:59.646 --> 18:02.149
"Look, Lala, I'm just telling
you what's been told to me.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.684
"I'm sorry that I've,
you know,

18:04.717 --> 18:07.387
repeated or believed things
that weren't true."

18:07.420 --> 18:09.256
- That's the Scheana
pushover.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.690
Scheana's pulling a Schwartz.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.460
Like, backing into a corner
and, like, not sticking up

18:13.493 --> 18:15.462
for the person
that you love so much.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.798
- She was being asked by Ariana
to pick a side,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.167
and she chose one.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.601
- And she didn't have to.
- And this is the thing.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.571
We're not here to dictate
who people can be friends with,

18:24.604 --> 18:28.575
but if somebody's willing
to sacrifice her best friends

18:28.608 --> 18:30.042
in order to just be liked,

18:30.076 --> 18:33.280
how am I ever gonna be able
to trust somebody like that?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.515
- I feel like I can't have
an opinion anymore,

18:35.548 --> 18:36.649
because it's wrong.
- You can't.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.685
It's been like this
for years,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.354
and it was fine when Stassi
and Kristen weren't around,

18:41.388 --> 18:42.822
but now they're back in.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.557
It's almost like they're
going back to their old ways.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.693
And you know what?
The last five years,

18:46.726 --> 18:49.429
I've called every single
incident that's happened.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.697
I'm like--who's the guy
that, like,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.265
predict the end of the world?
What was his name?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.033
Gandhi or what the f---
his name?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.302
When it comes to this group,

18:55.335 --> 18:58.004
I can predict
the future like Gandhi.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.806
Did Gandhi predict the future?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.475
Muhammad Gandhi,
right, is his name?

19:02.509 --> 19:05.545
Isn't he some, like,
Indian dude who, like--

19:05.578 --> 19:06.946
who is Gandhi?
What did he do?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.114
How are you supposed to go

19:08.215 --> 19:09.716
on this trip to Montauk
with these girls?

19:09.749 --> 19:12.652
- That's what I've been
struggling with all morning.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.054
- Well, then you can come
with us to Sonoma.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.589
I mean--but you might
be able to.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.291
- Katie wants to talk
while we're setting up

19:18.325 --> 19:20.227
for the party tomorrow,
and I said, "Absolutely not."

19:20.260 --> 19:22.562
I can't ruin
Shay's party tomorrow.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.433
- Yeah.
You've worked too hard on that.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.500
- Coming up...

19:27.534 --> 19:28.935
- Most men cheat down,
first of all.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.237
- I know that.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.504
- Okay, so I like to think,
"Do I still have it?"

19:31.538 --> 19:35.242
- Would you be willing
to take a sociopath quiz?

19:35.275 --> 19:36.343
- Sh--.

19:42.949 --> 19:48.355
*

19:48.388 --> 19:49.722
- Hello.
Good evening.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.258
How was everything?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.259
- Wonderful.
- Delicious.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.726
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yeah.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.262
- Okay.
- We would not lie to you.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.464
- I'm looking for a thing
for the champagne, but whatever.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.299
- I found one over there.
- Oh, cool.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.533
- Hi.
- Hey, Lisa.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.336
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Would you like anything?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.705
- I'll have a quarter of
a glass of rosé.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.507
I've had a long day.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.909
- Yeah. Me too.
- Why? What's going on?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.778
- Yesterday
I tried to mediate,

20:11.811 --> 20:14.514
as you, you know, suggested,

20:14.547 --> 20:18.318
and felt like everyone
got to say their side.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.287
So fast-forward
a couple of hours later,

20:20.320 --> 20:21.754
and Scheana told me
that she was

20:21.788 --> 20:23.556
getting a lot of texts
from Stassi

20:23.590 --> 20:25.825
and a lot of texts from Katie.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.327
- About what?
- It sounds like

20:27.360 --> 20:28.395
the conversation

20:28.428 --> 20:30.297
that we had got twisted.
- You know what?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.833
I think everybody
should stop, like,

20:33.866 --> 20:35.435
worrying about
all this bullsh--.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.769
Everybody should be
getting on.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.704
- I agree with you.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.838
- You're the one
with some sense.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.139
Cut the bullsh--.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.708
- I'm gonna say,
"Cut the bullsh--."

20:41.741 --> 20:42.742
- No, seriously.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.378
The hope when Ariana sat
the girls down

20:45.412 --> 20:46.879
would be that the girls

20:46.913 --> 20:49.015
would have a newfound respect
for each other,

20:49.048 --> 20:50.983
and I wouldn't have
to hear about it again,

20:51.017 --> 20:52.452
but unfortunately I was wrong.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.290
[upbeat music]

20:57.324 --> 21:01.428
*

21:01.461 --> 21:03.330
- I see you have,
like, vanilla vodka.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.831
Can I do that with,
like, Diet Coke?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.366
- Sure.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.900
- Feel like this looks like
a weapons case.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.736
It's not. So, like,
don't be freaked out.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.770
- [chuckles]

21:12.138 --> 21:13.906
- Hi.
- Hello.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.342
- How are you?
- I'm good.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.643
How are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.645
Really quick,
are we doing a podcast,

21:18.678 --> 21:20.347
or are we searching for ghosts?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.148
Beep, beep, beep.
Oh, we're getting closer.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.983
- Did you ever think
that you would wear my--

21:24.016 --> 21:25.017
- I'm not gonna lie.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.185
There's a lot of things
right now

21:26.218 --> 21:27.654
that I didn't think
would be happening, but--

21:27.687 --> 21:29.489
- That's for damn sure.
- I'm coming from a mess, like,

21:29.522 --> 21:31.358
at the apartment.
Scheana came over.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.759
She's kind of like,
"They all think alike."

21:32.792 --> 21:35.562
"They all" meaning you,
Kristen, and Katie. And--

21:35.595 --> 21:38.831
- That's such an easy, stupid,
like, just so,

21:38.865 --> 21:40.700
like,
one-dimensional thing to say.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.369
- I think she kind of thinks
it's like the "Mean Girls"

21:42.402 --> 21:43.503
kind of thing.
She thinks--

21:43.536 --> 21:45.171
- How are we mean?
What is Scheana doing?

21:45.204 --> 21:46.439
She's the one who f---ed up,

21:46.473 --> 21:48.908
and now she's crying
to Jax and Brittany?

21:48.941 --> 21:52.779
That is what she does
when she's caught or wrong.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.714
- Whoa. Like, you had, like,
notes and sh--?

21:54.747 --> 21:57.116
- I prepared for this
for a while.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.451
- Like, four years?

21:58.485 --> 22:00.753
[both laugh]

22:00.787 --> 22:02.622
- This is all supposed
to be in good fun,

22:02.655 --> 22:06.459
and I want my listeners
to be able to hear from somebody

22:06.493 --> 22:10.397
who has been a douche bag
for most of his life.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.864
- This is cool.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.232
You know, it's kind of hard
to argue with Stassi

22:13.265 --> 22:15.067
when she says
I used to be a douche bag.

22:15.101 --> 22:19.171
I mean cheating on her was
a bad thing to do, obviously,

22:19.205 --> 22:22.509
but if I never would have done
all that douche bagging I guess

22:22.542 --> 22:24.310
I wouldn't be who I am today.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.678
- Are you ready for this?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.246
- I don't know.
We'll see.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.883
- I'm not sure whether I'm,
like, proud or mortified

22:30.917 --> 22:33.486
about my next guest.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.021
Should I introduce you
as, like...

22:35.054 --> 22:37.690
- I think you should.
- Jax Taylor or Jason Cauchi?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.692
- Well, you've called me
every name anyway, so--

22:39.726 --> 22:41.127
- That's true.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.097
I was researching this, and 48%
of men say that the reason

22:45.131 --> 22:48.334
that they cheat is because
of emotional dissatisfaction,

22:48.435 --> 22:50.336
meaning they don't
feel appreciated.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.738
- Yes. I agree. 100%.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.072
I've been down
that road before,

22:53.105 --> 22:55.174
and I--it has nothing
to do with looks.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.010
I read a fact that most men
cheat down, first of all.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.045
- I know that.
- Okay,

22:59.078 --> 23:00.079
so it has nothing
to do with looks.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.914
I dated the hottest girls.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.816
I mean I've had a couple
that I've--whatever,

23:03.850 --> 23:05.852
but I've dated always pretty,
pretty girls,

23:05.885 --> 23:07.253
so it has nothing
to do with looks.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.521
I like to think,
"Do I still have it?

23:08.555 --> 23:11.090
Can I still go out there
and attract other women?"

23:11.123 --> 23:12.625
I don't want to ever think
that I lost that.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.862
- Okay, so do you think that
maybe that makes you somebody

23:15.895 --> 23:18.931
that doesn't care about
other people's feelings?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.900
- Probably. Yes.
At the time, yes.

23:20.933 --> 23:25.472
- Would you be willing
to take a sociopath quiz?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.039
- Am I really gonna take a
sociopath--

23:27.073 --> 23:28.307
I mean--all right.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.876
Let's take a sociopath test.
Here we go.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.611
- Disagree or agree.
- Okay.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.581
- "Success is based on
survival of the fittest.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.149
I am not concerned
about the losers."

23:37.183 --> 23:39.351
- I agree.
- "I find myself in

23:39.385 --> 23:43.255
the same kinds
of trouble time after time."

23:43.289 --> 23:44.757
- Yes.
- I'll just answer that for you.

23:44.791 --> 23:45.792
Okay.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.495
- I'm a sociopath. Sh--.
- Okay.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.062
"People who are stupid enough

23:50.096 --> 23:52.499
to get ripped off
usually deserve it."

23:52.499 --> 23:54.634
- Yes.
- That's why you...

23:54.667 --> 23:55.735
steal sunglasses.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.504
[both laugh]

23:57.504 --> 23:59.772
"Love is overrated."

23:59.806 --> 24:01.040
- No.
- You can redeem yourself.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.174
- No.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.143
- "Are you aggressive
or cool-headed?"

24:04.176 --> 24:05.277
- Aggressive.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.547
- "Do you fail
to learn from experience?"

24:07.580 --> 24:09.649
True or false.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.919
- True. Uh-oh. Sh--.
I'm so scared.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.554
- Oh. You are a sociopath,
and oh, my God.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.388
It's Hannibal Lecter's face.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.024
- I am a sociopath.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.526
I really don't think
Brittany's gonna leave me

24:19.526 --> 24:22.228
because I did a test
on the computer.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.697
- Jax shouldn't feel bad
about being a sociopath.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.600
I mean Tom Sandoval
is probably a narcissist.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.268
Kristen meets
most of the criteria

24:29.301 --> 24:31.037
for borderline
personality disorder.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.239
Ariana has
a superiority complex.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.241
Katie has anger
management issues.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.543
Scheana's a hypochondriac.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.145
I'm an alcoholic,
so he's in good company.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.280
- That was good.
- You did such a great job.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.849
Thank you so much
for being so honest.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.150
- You're very, very welcome.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.552
I feel like I had, like,
a therapy session from today.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.886
- I'm so glad.
- It was like, "Are you nervous

24:46.919 --> 24:48.420
about going tomorrow
a little bit?"

24:48.454 --> 24:50.389
I think it was supposed to be
such a fun party.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.691
- It will be fun, though.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.626
- I feel like you
can just save it.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.961
- I'm not gonna confront her

24:54.994 --> 24:57.830
when people are out
at Shay's birthday, like--

24:57.864 --> 24:59.198
- It's gonna be awkward
bringing somebody

24:59.231 --> 25:00.767
like that
on a birthday trip isn't it?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.703
- Well, I'm hoping
that she fixes it.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.706
[upbeat music]

25:06.739 --> 25:10.577
*

25:10.577 --> 25:12.579
- This one's all finished?

25:12.612 --> 25:14.380
- What's going on?
Are you okay to work?

25:14.413 --> 25:15.815
- I'm fine to work.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.117
If I talk about it, I get upset.
I'm totally fine to work.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.586
- What's wrong?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.187
- We talked about the whole
thing with Lala's dating.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.255
Like, I said, "You know what?

25:23.289 --> 25:24.591
You're saying this isn't true,

25:24.591 --> 25:26.593
"so I'm gonna apologize
for anything untrue

25:26.626 --> 25:28.060
I've said about you."

25:28.094 --> 25:29.095
End of the world.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.665
I repulsed Katie were her words.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.601
- I thought you and Katie
were so good.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.602
- I'm fine.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.237
I'm doing my job just fine.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.338
- Hi.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.840
- What's going on between
you two?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.975
Why is she in tears?
Why is she in tears?

25:43.009 --> 25:44.443
- I don't know.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.678
We haven't had a chance
to talk about it.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.446
- Have you got tables
you're waiting on?

25:47.479 --> 25:49.816
- My table in garden left
is closing out right now.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.518
- When that closes out--
what about you?

25:52.619 --> 25:54.453
- Well, no. I'm like--
I don't want to have

25:54.486 --> 25:56.756
a conversation tonight
about this.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.290
I don't want to talk about
while at work.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.427
- Well, I'm not gonna talk
to you at Shay's party tomorrow.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.963
- I've immersed myself
in this fight

26:03.996 --> 26:09.501
that sometimes seems
almost impossible, really.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.671
Doesn't it, Harrison?

26:11.704 --> 26:12.972
I don't want
to see you two fighting.

26:13.005 --> 26:13.940
We've been there.
We've done that.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.207
I don't want to see it again.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.843
Okay?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.110
Why am I paying these people?

26:18.144 --> 26:20.046
They should be paying me
for therapy.

26:20.079 --> 26:24.550
Right, Harrison?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.018
And that's wrong.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.987
That's not sold out.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.421
- Coming up...

26:29.455 --> 26:31.223
Scheana went over crying
that we're so mean to her.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.160
I'm like, "We haven't even got
a chance to be mean to you yet."

26:40.532 --> 26:47.874
*

26:47.907 --> 26:49.809
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.444
- Thank you
for bringing everything.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.681
- All right.
Let's do this.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.816
- Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.
- Yeah. Teamwork.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.018
- Thank you so much for coming
with me this morning.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.453
- Of course. I'm happy to be
here and happy to help.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.521
- I just want to have fun.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.890
I can't wait for tacos.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.759
Okay, so try to have, like,
Schwartz bring Carter in.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.560
like, leave at the same time
as Shay,

27:08.594 --> 27:10.697
so they can walk in together.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.931
- Oh, I'm so excited.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.999
I can't wait for the--
I've never, like,

27:13.032 --> 27:14.000
been to an actual
surprise party.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.267
- Dude, I've never
planned one.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.502
- Kristen has to get here
so we can--

27:16.535 --> 27:19.171
- I know. I feel like
I just heard her voice.

27:19.205 --> 27:22.709
- This is really heavy.
[grunting]

27:22.709 --> 27:24.510
- So much stuff.

27:24.543 --> 27:27.479
- Balloon time.
- Party time motha f---as.

27:27.513 --> 27:31.217
[all talking at once]

27:31.250 --> 27:32.451
- Can we just make Sandoval
bartend the whole time?ah.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.520
- What is that?
- It's a margarita baby pool.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.723
- It's gonna be one
salty-ass margarita.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.358
- Kristen, was there
more ice or no?

27:39.391 --> 27:42.161
- No. Whatever we brought.
- No. Tom, and Ariana,

27:42.194 --> 27:44.263
and Jax are all bringing some.
I just wanted to make sure.

27:44.296 --> 27:47.934
- Should I do the whole thing?
- Yeah.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.435
- I mean, like,
not everyone's gonna stick

27:49.468 --> 27:51.403
a straw in a baby pool
and drink out of it.

27:51.437 --> 27:54.841
- Well, then we need to not
have them as our friends.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.044
Do you think this is a bad look
that the three wicked witches

27:58.077 --> 27:59.746
are together doing this?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.180
Maybe I should go help them.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.115
- I mean, she's being
surprisingly, like, normal.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.217
- I want to just start
getting this filled.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.653
- Are we gonna ignore
this all day long?

28:07.754 --> 28:08.755
- What's scaring me is that,
like,

28:08.755 --> 28:09.956
it just keeps getting worse.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.358
Like, at first she just said
she apologized to Lala.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.760
Yesterday when
I was with Jax,

28:13.793 --> 28:15.394
Jax was just telling me
how Scheana went over

28:15.427 --> 28:17.596
to his crying
that we're so mean to her.

28:17.629 --> 28:20.432
I'm like, "We haven't even got
a chance to be mean to you yet."

28:20.466 --> 28:21.934
[ice crunches]

28:21.968 --> 28:23.235
*

28:23.269 --> 28:25.271
- Brittany came this morning,
right, to set up?

28:25.304 --> 28:29.275
- Yeah.
- Oh, there it is.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.778
- Oh, yeah, there's balloons.
Looking good so far.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.112
Where's the alcohol?

28:33.145 --> 28:34.346
- Hey!

28:34.380 --> 28:36.082
- Party's here.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.083
- It's hot outside.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.151
It's good pool weather.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.653
Hi.
- Hi.

28:41.687 --> 28:42.955
- Keeping it classy.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.124
- Hell yeah.
- It's a margarita baby pool.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.793
[noisemaker honks]
- Oh, my God.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.794
- [laughs]

28:47.827 --> 28:50.096
*

28:50.129 --> 28:51.931
- They're here. They're here.
They're here.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.199
- Like, gather by the pool.
- You guys, they're here.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.801
They're here. They're here.
Okay. Holy f---.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.169
- Keep your voices down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.237
*

28:58.270 --> 28:59.605
- I think we're going up
this way.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.407
I think I got chosen
as the candidate to bring down

29:01.440 --> 29:03.475
Shay and Carter
to their surprise birthday party

29:03.509 --> 29:05.577
because I'm not gossipy,

29:05.611 --> 29:07.847
and I'm not gonna
ruin the surprise.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.149
You know, like Jax would.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.483
- Shh. Shh.
- Everyone.

29:11.517 --> 29:19.158
*

29:19.191 --> 29:21.427
all: Surprise!

29:21.460 --> 29:23.863
[all cheering]
- Whoo!

29:25.231 --> 29:26.198
- Holy sh--.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.399
[laughter]

29:27.433 --> 29:28.700
- They told me it was
your surprise party.

29:28.734 --> 29:29.869
- They told me it was
your surprise party.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.170
- Oh, my God.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.873
- This party isn't exactly
a surprise party.

29:33.906 --> 29:37.409
I mean, both guys knew they were
going to a surprise party.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.511
- It's both y'all's
surprise party.

29:39.545 --> 29:40.579
- Hey!

29:40.612 --> 29:41.848
- Gotcha.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.250
- It's not a surprise.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.686
- I've never had nor planned
a surprise party.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.022
- You still haven't.
- I know we got a lot of vodka,

29:50.056 --> 29:51.190
'cause I bought it.
- Yeah.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.691
[laughter]

29:52.724 --> 29:55.227
He's not gonna drink it,
but we bought it together.

29:55.261 --> 29:55.761
- Yeah.
[laughter]

29:57.629 --> 30:00.599
[upbeat music]

30:00.632 --> 30:07.639
*

30:10.209 --> 30:11.177
- Jax, stop.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.611
Not right now!
[both laugh]

30:12.644 --> 30:13.679
- Not right now?

30:13.712 --> 30:15.814
That means later.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.383
- Best girlfriend ever.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.985
You're the worst
at keeping secrets.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.053
- This is the only secret
I've ever kept in my whole life.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.789
- You rock, babe.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.124
- Doggy-paddle over here.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.959
- Someone's panicking.
- I wasn't panicking.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.395
- I want to talk to you about
something really serious though.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.697
First of all, you need to shave
those nipples.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.132
- Yes.
And the armpit hair.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.633
There's too much armpit hair.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.802
- Second of all, I got
a really good body bronzer

30:36.835 --> 30:38.004
that will f---ing
change your life.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.605
- Dude, I'm not that pasty.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.673
- I need sunglasses
right now a little bit.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.642
- Could be
the salvation of Carter.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.511
- Uh-oh.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.752
They think with one mind
and one mind only.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.521
- Well, they've moved away
from the hive mind, but anyway--

30:55.554 --> 30:57.356
- That's not--so...

30:58.891 --> 31:01.293
- No it's not.
- I hate to say it.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.562
- Listen, it's like a mafia,
because it's very enticing,

31:03.595 --> 31:05.497
and there's a lot of perks
to being in the mafia.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.767
But there's also--
there's strings attached.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.536
Scheana should be very concerned

31:10.569 --> 31:13.272
about her standing
in this family.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.541
- You have to understand
that it wasn't cool.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.842
- Okay, and I understand that.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.945
And for that
I am going to apologize.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.080
- Are you saying
that we three share a brain?

31:21.113 --> 31:22.148
- Because the three of you feel

31:22.181 --> 31:23.950
the same way
about the situation.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.751
- About what?
- And now you guys

31:25.784 --> 31:27.319
all share
the same opinions about this.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.720
- And everyone
in the f---ing world

31:28.754 --> 31:30.089
should share that opinion--

31:30.122 --> 31:31.723
- Yes, but now I'm finally
choosing to just let--

31:31.757 --> 31:33.825
- Do you know Stassi literally
thinks there's a possibility

31:33.859 --> 31:35.327
that you won't even come
to her birthday

31:35.361 --> 31:37.063
and that you're gonna go
to Ariana's instead?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.531
- If she still wants me to come,
then of course I would go.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.969
I feel like the future of our
friendship depends on this trip.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.571
If I don't go,
Stassi will never forgive me,

31:45.604 --> 31:47.739
and Katie will be
that much more mad at me.

31:47.773 --> 31:48.975
And I can't afford

31:48.975 --> 31:50.209
for her to cut me
out of being a bridesmaid.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.610
I don't like fighting
with my friends.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.179
- I know that. Don't cry.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.282
Today we can just have fun,
because of the circumstances.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.716
That would be great.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.319
Take a deep breath.
Don't cry.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.555
We've been waiting for this
for a month and a half, okay?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.692
I occasionally have to play
mom to my friends.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.893
Actually it's not occasionally.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.895
It's all the time. 24/7.

32:09.996 --> 32:13.532
And this is exactly why
I don't have children yet.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.801
- Hi. I, like,
don't know where to go.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.203
I'm like, "Oh, wait.
You're mad at me. Sh--.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.537
You're mad at me too."

32:18.570 --> 32:21.007
- You good? You good?
- Happy birthday, man.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.508
- Happy birthday.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.710
- I'm supposed to fly across
the country with you in a week?

32:24.743 --> 32:26.178
How the f---
am I supposed to do that?

32:26.212 --> 32:27.879
- Do you think you guys will,
like, work it out before then?

32:27.913 --> 32:29.281
- I mean, come on.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.649
I want to just let this go.
I just want you to be happy.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.152
- You just, like, hate all
the same people together.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.286
Is that it? I don't--

32:34.320 --> 32:35.487
- Scheana, I have to
tell you something.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.157
That we've already
gotten NASCAR tickets.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.691
- We already had to get passes,

32:39.725 --> 32:41.693
and to get passes
we had to give names.

32:41.727 --> 32:45.097
I feel really bad for Scheana,
because I would love to say,

32:45.131 --> 32:48.767
"Come on my trip,"
but I don't have room for her.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.637
Every bed, every ticket
is spoken for.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.373
- We can't add anybody.
So, like, if sh--

32:54.406 --> 32:59.778
doesn't work with you and them,
like, you can't come with us.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.313
- I know.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.714
- Coming up...

33:02.748 --> 33:06.952
- I sat there trying
to defend you, and they suck.

33:07.053 --> 33:10.856
They can go f--- themselves.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.097
*

33:18.130 --> 33:19.431
- Did you see your balloon?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.470
I actually thought about
buying multiple ones

33:24.503 --> 33:26.238
so I didn't f--- it up.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.573
- Well, Shay, I didn't mean

33:27.606 --> 33:29.575
to drag you down here
all shady and stuff.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.310
- I thought there were
strippers or something.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.611
- I wanted to
ask you something.

33:32.644 --> 33:33.612
[sighs]

33:33.645 --> 33:35.081
I'm about to be married.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.216
- Dude, I did it, so I know
what you're going through.

33:37.249 --> 33:42.721
- I think I've exorcised
all my doubts and cynicism.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.490
What's the word?
- I don't know.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.326
- Anyways, I think
this is the money talking.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.195
It's starting to,
like, rack up.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.664
First of all, I wanted
to keep it at, like, $15,000.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.966
(laughing)
Don't laugh.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.368
- I don't even know
what ours cost.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.536
- That's f---ed up, dude.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.138
- I now declare
you husband and wife.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.139
- [squeals]

34:00.172 --> 34:03.475
[cheers and applause]

34:03.509 --> 34:04.976
- 50 f---ing grand?

34:05.010 --> 34:05.977
Come on, man.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.246
Right now Shay's, like,

34:07.279 --> 34:09.115
the only guy who has gone
through the same thing

34:09.148 --> 34:12.551
that I'm going through
which is women planning weddings

34:12.584 --> 34:15.121
without any regard for budget.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.788
How much are
wedding photographers?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.190
- They can go up to $10,000.
- What?

34:18.224 --> 34:20.626
Did you put the order
in for the invitations?

34:20.659 --> 34:23.429
- They are, like, 18 apiece.
- What?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.532
- We wanted to keep with under,
like, 50.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.866
- What?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.635
- When we were wedding planning,
and Scheana would say,

34:29.668 --> 34:31.002
like, numbers to me,

34:31.036 --> 34:33.439
in my head, as a guy,
I would be like,

34:33.472 --> 34:34.640
"Why don't we just, like,

34:34.673 --> 34:36.975
get married easy
and then save that money?" Yeah.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.144
- Why don't we elope?
Why don't we elope?

34:38.144 --> 34:39.611
That's a down payment
on a house.

34:39.645 --> 34:40.712
- Oh, yeah.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.047
- I think we share
the same philosophy.

34:42.148 --> 34:45.050
Don't enquire too much
about the costs of things.

34:45.151 --> 34:47.419
Just deal with the pain
at the end, you know?

34:47.453 --> 34:50.856
I was like,
"That's, like, three jet skis."

34:50.889 --> 34:51.923
- Hey, I haven't even got

34:51.957 --> 34:53.725
to talk to you yet
about the podcast.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.827
- Brittany--
- How'd it go?

34:55.861 --> 34:57.028
- It was so entertaining.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.930
- It was good?
- The only thing that was, like,

34:58.964 --> 35:00.866
really funny--
and I asked him permission.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.302
I was like, "Will you take
a sociopath quiz?"

35:03.335 --> 35:04.303
- Oh, god.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.637
I'm gonna be honest.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.639
I don't really know
exactly what a sociopath is.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.441
Did he fail it?

35:09.475 --> 35:11.177
Miserably?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.711
Yeah, he did.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.180
[clears throat]
- "Sociopath:

35:14.213 --> 35:16.282
"a person with
a personality disorder

35:16.315 --> 35:19.451
"manifesting itself
in extreme antisocial attitudes

35:19.485 --> 35:23.189
and behavior
and a lack of conscience."

35:23.189 --> 35:27.326
Yeah. It's not the worst thing
I don't think,

35:27.359 --> 35:29.928
but definitely not
the end of the world.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.563
On another note,
I was kind of wondering

35:31.597 --> 35:34.866
what was going on with you
and Scheana in that situation.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.668
Are you able to see
where Scheana's coming from?

35:36.702 --> 35:38.804
- The only thing that I see
right now is her saying that,

35:38.837 --> 35:41.840
"I don't want any more drama
with anybody,

35:41.873 --> 35:45.944
and, like, I am just, like,
ready to just, like, let it go."

35:45.977 --> 35:48.214
- I'm a lot more, like,
understanding on certain things,

35:48.247 --> 35:50.216
because I am kind of like her

35:50.216 --> 35:52.117
where I'm, like,
super forgiving.

35:52.218 --> 35:53.985
- I feel like I should
learn something from you,

35:54.019 --> 35:56.222
but at the same time
I need to know, like,

35:56.222 --> 35:58.424
that I can trust somebody,
and that somebody's loyal.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.227
Listen, I love that
Brittany's classy as f---

36:01.260 --> 36:04.029
and can just kind of, like,
rise above things.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.598
Unfortunately for Scheana,
that's not me.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.633
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.734
- Feel like my face
is sweating off.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.636
- I'm gonna
let you girls talk.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.638
Careful.
Don't lean on it.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.105
- It's very wobbly.
- Yeah.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.241
I just found that out.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.545
Please tell me what's going on.
I know what you heard.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.647
I'm sure you must have assumed,
"What the f---?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.349
Scheana was apologizing?
Like, that's insane."

36:23.382 --> 36:25.050
- Stand up for something.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.052
Stand up for something.
- I am.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.720
I'm standing up for myself
saying that I'm done.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.589
- You're supposed to be
our best friend.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.923
What are you even saying?
- And I am.

36:31.957 --> 36:32.958
I'm just saying...
- But how can you ask that?

36:32.991 --> 36:34.660
- Can we let all of
this anger go?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.462
- Why are you asking people
to let it go?

36:36.495 --> 36:39.765
You have not been hurt by her
in a really serious way.

36:39.798 --> 36:40.966
I am trying to tell you--

36:40.999 --> 36:42.468
- Were you there
for the conversation? I'm sorry.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.504
Ariana, can you come join
this conversation, please?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.838
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you can't fight

36:46.872 --> 36:48.374
a battle on your own.
You can't talk.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.808
- No, because you weren't there.
- We can't have a conversation.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.443
- You weren't there.
- Okay.

36:51.477 --> 36:54.145
Well, I am more than happy
to talk about this with Ariana.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.547
- You weren't there.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.484
- What is this
that is going on?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.286
Because all I know--

37:00.286 --> 37:02.688
- We all work together
at Sur.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.691
Lisa had advised me
to try to mediate--

37:05.724 --> 37:07.926
- Mediate, but you're
Lala's friend.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.295
- But I'm Katie's friend too.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.497
- Okay, but it's not
a mediating situation.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.900
Do you realize how much Lala
has done terrible sh--

37:14.933 --> 37:17.503
to Katie and said awful things?

37:17.536 --> 37:19.137
Ariana doesn't get it.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.072
Lala said she wanted to f---

37:21.106 --> 37:23.742
Tom Schwartz
after he leaves Katie

37:23.775 --> 37:26.745
because she knows that
they're gonna get a divorce.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.114
This girl is f---ing evil.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.516
- You're acting like
I'm discrediting that.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.683
- No one's saying
that that's okay.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.819
- Why are you asking Katie
to be friends with Lala?

37:33.852 --> 37:35.754
- No one's asking this.
- Are you f---ing kidding me?

37:35.787 --> 37:37.889
I did not say that.
That is not what I said.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.391
- You guys have said have
a clean slate.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.693
- Oh, my God.
- No one ever asked for this.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.995
- Can we stop bringing up
the old sh--?

37:44.029 --> 37:45.631
- Saying, "I don't want
to be friends with that person,

37:45.664 --> 37:46.965
and don't make me
talk to that person."

37:46.998 --> 37:48.166
- I don't.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.535
- And that's
what Katie's asking.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.637
- "Like, how could you,
like--I just don't understand

37:51.670 --> 37:53.505
how you can, like,
be friends

37:53.539 --> 37:55.173
with someone like that."

37:55.206 --> 37:57.609
She gets into this
very heightened state,

37:57.643 --> 38:00.045
and I find her very annoying.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.447
- Lala isn't somebody
that is--

38:01.480 --> 38:02.848
- You won't ever
let anybody finish.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.416
You won't even let us
finish a sentence.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.051
- Okay. I'm gonna be quiet, and
I'm gonna let everybody talk.

38:06.084 --> 38:09.388
- We'll take turns, like how you
would in normal conversation.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.256
- That is so
condescending.

38:11.357 --> 38:13.359
- You're so emotional,
Stassi.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.026
You're so emotional,
and I don't know

38:15.060 --> 38:16.528
how to have a conversation with
someone that's so emotional.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.963
- Then don't have
a conversation with me,

38:17.996 --> 38:19.498
and I'll just, like, walk off.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.699
- Well, I mean, like,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.368
can't we just talk about it,
like, normally?

38:22.401 --> 38:25.404
Why are you getting so heated?

38:25.437 --> 38:27.238
Why are you so heated?

38:29.608 --> 38:31.910
- [sobbing]

38:31.943 --> 38:35.013
- Like, oh my God.
It was not like that.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.516
- [sobbing]

38:37.549 --> 38:39.718
[knocks on door]

38:39.751 --> 38:41.620
- Hey.
What's wrong?

38:41.653 --> 38:42.654
- They suck.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.756
Scheana and Ariana suck, Katie.

38:44.790 --> 38:48.093
I sat there and tried
to defend you, and they suck.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.395
[sobbing]
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.963
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop. Hold on.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.265
Wait. What happened?
What happened?

38:54.299 --> 38:55.867
- She was just trying
to talk to Scheana alone,

38:55.901 --> 38:58.036
and Scheana pulled Ariana
out of the pool.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.038
- They can
go f--- themselves!

39:00.071 --> 39:02.007
I'm so angry right now.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.016
and stands up next to me.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.251
- Stassi, let's go sit
on the couch out there,

39:13.284 --> 39:15.020
because we're sitting
on a bathroom floor.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.024
- Can you guys--can I please
just talk to you?

39:19.057 --> 39:20.025
- Yeah. Let's talk.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.593
- Okay, but can you guys
please go?

39:21.627 --> 39:22.594
both: No.

39:22.628 --> 39:23.995
- I had to have
a conversation, Scheana,

39:24.029 --> 39:25.431
and you pulled
somebody else in.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.833
- Because I said
you weren't there.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.001
- It doesn't matter
who's there!

39:30.035 --> 39:32.438
- So I'm saying how about you
hear someone else's side?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.540
- Well, then I can hear it out
right now.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.442
- The conversation began
with you and I,

39:36.475 --> 39:37.743
and then when
you started saying

39:37.776 --> 39:39.778
"you guys" and "you guys."
- Yes.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.248
Jax told me you think
that we are all this, like--

39:43.281 --> 39:45.183
- I said you guys all have
the same opinion on this.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.184
- We do not.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.686
Stop being a bitch.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.788
Stop being an asshole.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.790
- I'm done gossiping about her.
I'm done talking about her.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.291
I'm done giving a f---
about who she sleeps with.

39:53.324 --> 39:54.460
- It's not about Lala!
- I don't care.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.561
I'm letting that sh-- go.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.595
I'm so--I'm done
talking about it.

39:56.628 --> 39:57.863
- Scheana,
it's not about her.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.931
It's not about her.
It's not about her.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.535
It's about the fact that you
don't care how hurt she's been.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.337
You don't give a f---
about anyone but yourself.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.640
- Okay. That's insane for you
to say I don't care.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.775
- And that is what
this is about.

40:09.808 --> 40:10.776
You only want to be
liked by everybody.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.010
- That is not what
this is about.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.445
- And that is what your f---ing
Achilles heel is.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.246
- I'm sorry you guys
don't know me better.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.248
- You think that you're being
a bigger person by,

40:17.282 --> 40:18.517
"Hey, let go of sh--."

40:18.550 --> 40:19.918
Like, "Oh, I don't want
to feel anger,

40:19.951 --> 40:22.287
"so I'm gonna give her
a sarcastic apology.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.122
I don't want to be your friend,
and I don't like her."

40:24.155 --> 40:25.657
That's really adult
of you.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.726
- These girls are so mad at me
for something

40:27.759 --> 40:29.094
that didn't even happen.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.630
Like, they are so drunk
and emotional

40:31.663 --> 40:33.732
they're not listening
to the facts.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.400
Katie, in the last six months

40:35.433 --> 40:37.903
you've gotten angry
like Tequila Katie again.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.006
- Okay. That is what--
- But I'm saying

40:41.039 --> 40:43.408
it's happened more often,
and I'm like,

40:43.441 --> 40:44.976
"Dude,
is there something wrong?"

40:45.010 --> 40:46.444
- You can't throw that
in my face.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.013
- Katie, I'm just saying
that there's something wrong.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.414
I just want you to be happy.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.482
I don't see how you
don't see that.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.283
- I'm sorry.
Have I been unhappy?

40:52.317 --> 40:54.052
Have I been unhappy?
Have I been angry?

40:54.085 --> 40:55.987
The only reason
I'm angry about Lala is

40:56.021 --> 40:58.356
because of
your f---ing mouth.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.859
- Aside from everything
I've been seeing, Schwartz

41:00.892 --> 41:03.294
has also been telling me Katie's
behavior has not been good.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.697
- I know that you guys
are close now.

41:05.731 --> 41:08.233
You guys, like, hang out and--
- Don't do that to them. Bubby--

41:08.266 --> 41:09.535
- You don't f---ing ever listen.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.002
It's like being
in a relationship

41:11.036 --> 41:12.337
with the f---ing wall.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.639
- Bubba?

41:13.672 --> 41:15.306
- Talk about how your dick
doesn't work either.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.642
- It does worry me.

41:16.675 --> 41:20.145
- If I'm so unhappy,
unhappy--no.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.279
It's because, Scheana,

41:21.312 --> 41:23.949
you cannot accept
that you f---ed up.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.684
- I apologized
for untrue statements.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.853
- You're trying to make me
look bad.

41:27.886 --> 41:31.857
- Oh, my God.
- Scheana, I can read you like

41:31.890 --> 41:34.726
a f---ing book.
- Okay. Well, that's how I feel.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.695
- You're the most f---ing,
like, transparent person.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.896
- Then why are you friends
with me?

41:37.929 --> 41:39.230
I'm so transparent. Okay.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.566
- I'm sorry that I'm--
- I'm going back

41:40.566 --> 41:43.134
to my husband's party.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.904
Over the past few years,
I've fought with my friends

41:45.937 --> 41:48.106
and made up with them.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.308
So that was really fun.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.812
I've never thought I was better
than them until this moment,

41:53.845 --> 41:56.147
because they're acting
like assholes.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.817
Apparently I'm
the most transparent,

41:58.850 --> 42:00.619
fake person she's ever met.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.120
She can read me like whatever.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.956
They keep saying, "You want
to be friends with her."

42:04.990 --> 42:06.324
God. You say one f---ing thing.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.594
Now she's like--she's just mean.

42:08.627 --> 42:12.097
*

42:12.130 --> 42:14.365
- Jesus f---ing Christ.
I'm over it.

42:14.399 --> 42:15.967
*

42:16.001 --> 42:18.503
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:18.604 --> 42:20.706
- I don't even know what
to do about this trip.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.808
Like, I don't know
if Stassi's gonna dis-invite me.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.442
- They're just bullies, dude.
They are.

42:24.475 --> 42:26.612
- If she decides
not to come it's like,

42:26.612 --> 42:28.513
"Are you also gonna not
want to be a bridesmaid?"

42:28.614 --> 42:30.882
This is like the opposite
of bridesmaid behavior.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.450
- I feel like I get
one of those punch cards.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.052
You know, five surgeries.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.788
Get the sixth one free.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.156
- [laughs]

42:38.189 --> 42:39.524
- I'm so excited.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.226
- I want to go and have
a good time on your birthday.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.862
Like, even if that means
there's no conversation.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.331
Like, we don't speak
one word to each other.

42:46.364 --> 42:47.899
- I miss working for you.

42:47.933 --> 42:51.269
I did take what I have
for granted, and I f---ed it up.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.838
- And you're still
screwing it up.

42:52.871 --> 42:54.640
- [sighs]

42:54.640 --> 42:56.041
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"

42:56.074 --> 42:57.643
go to bravotv.com.
