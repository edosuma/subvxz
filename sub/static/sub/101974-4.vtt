00:03.195 --> 00:04.837
Time to get up.

00:04.988 --> 00:06.988
MARTIN:
And a very good morning
to you, Mr. David.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.324
What's on the itinerary
for today?

00:09.343 --> 00:12.085
Same as yesterday,
same as tomorrow.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.253

01:17.578 --> 01:19.469
Figuratively speaking,
of course.

01:19.488 --> 01:20.987
(chuckles)

01:21.082 --> 01:24.732
No, I haven't felt
this kind of urgency in years.

01:24.794 --> 01:28.420
It's incredible, the...
the truths

01:28.589 --> 01:31.481
a brush with death
will uncover.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.925
Brush with death?

01:33.118 --> 01:36.653
Bro, you got your ass jumped
at Sunday School.

01:36.713 --> 01:39.656
It was Bible study, Hector.

01:39.758 --> 01:42.542
And much like
the New Testament,

01:42.694 --> 01:45.938
I found
the entire experience...

01:46.131 --> 01:47.940
revelatory.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.859
I once was lost...

01:52.988 --> 01:54.729
...but now am found.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.765
MARSH:
That's wonderful, Martin,
but your time's up.

01:57.827 --> 02:00.285
Jerry.
Why don't you

02:00.478 --> 02:02.028
share your exciting news?

02:02.123 --> 02:05.124
Oh, uh...
(chuckles)

02:05.317 --> 02:07.108
I'm getting released tomorrow.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.943
(laughing)

02:09.004 --> 02:11.630
Oh, I just feel
really grateful.

02:11.781 --> 02:13.298
I'm finally on the right meds.

02:13.450 --> 02:15.467
Oh, I'd like to think
my therapy helped a bit, too.

02:15.619 --> 02:17.619
(Jerry laughs)

02:17.680 --> 02:20.197
Yeah, I, um... I couldn't
be here without all of you.

02:20.215 --> 02:22.699
I just can't believe
that I'm gonna be sipping a beer

02:22.759 --> 02:24.718
by the ocean
this time tomorrow,

02:24.812 --> 02:27.053
eating a great big lobster
and...

02:27.189 --> 02:29.464
All right, Rick Steves.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.600
No need
for your whole itinerary.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.378
I just... I had no idea

02:34.438 --> 02:37.230
how much
I needed out of this place.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.657
Inside these walls, it's like...

02:38.826 --> 02:41.051
-it's like-it's like...
-(knuckles cracking)

02:41.111 --> 02:42.644
you're not really alive.
(chuckles)

02:42.705 --> 02:46.223
(sighs)
Not anymore.

02:46.283 --> 02:47.574
(Jerry slaps thighs rapidly)

02:47.668 --> 02:49.984
I'm gonna be free.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.653
(Jerry giggles)

02:51.714 --> 02:55.048
Well, I am very happy
for you, Jerry.

02:59.871 --> 03:02.088
Not sure brunch
necessitates a 911 text...

03:02.224 --> 03:04.850
Stop there.

03:05.001 --> 03:07.060
Do you know the horrors
that happened here?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.857
JESSICA:
Aha!

03:12.026 --> 03:13.525
There's the culprit.

03:13.677 --> 03:16.753
You.
You are the spiller of wine?

03:16.855 --> 03:19.347
What's going on?
Who is he?

03:19.408 --> 03:21.091
Do you remember that rug

03:21.109 --> 03:23.518
my two ne'er-do-well children
ruined?

03:23.579 --> 03:26.763
Hans is helping me
find a replacement.

03:26.823 --> 03:29.266
No doubt
a horridly expensive one.

03:29.284 --> 03:31.101
Blame your skinny millennial.

03:31.161 --> 03:32.452
(both laugh)

03:32.588 --> 03:34.028
Who throws out
a priceless heirloom

03:34.048 --> 03:35.288
over a little Burgundy stain?

03:35.424 --> 03:38.199
JESSICA:
Honestly, darling, he's right.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.885
I have never
understood this story.

03:41.004 --> 03:42.203
Well...

03:42.223 --> 03:46.391
actually, Hans,
it was a 2007 Syrah.

03:46.584 --> 03:50.062
And the story's
pretty simple, Mother.

03:50.213 --> 03:51.638
Ainsley and I came back
from the hospital

03:51.732 --> 03:54.900
after Gil's stabbing,
and we were upset.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.128
Stop!

03:58.188 --> 03:59.629
Ainsley was

03:59.690 --> 04:01.055
<i> a little tipsy,</i>

04:01.158 --> 04:02.908
she grabbed for the bottle.

04:03.101 --> 04:04.818
Aah! Aah!

04:04.912 --> 04:06.152
And it fell...

04:06.247 --> 04:07.729
Aah!

04:07.790 --> 04:09.748
...spilling everywhere.

04:10.701 --> 04:12.334
And the rug...

04:13.312 --> 04:14.644
...was beyond repair.

04:14.663 --> 04:16.922
-She's always been so clumsy.
-She felt

04:17.091 --> 04:19.758
so bad that she nearly
had a panic attack.

04:19.951 --> 04:22.678
(scoffs)
At least one of you has a soul.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.890
Jessica, come.
Let's talk pillows.

04:39.338 --> 04:41.446
Oh, come on, Martin.

04:41.639 --> 04:43.448
It's my form, isn't it?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.117
It's so much more than that.

04:45.310 --> 04:46.693
Has my son called?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.195
Oh, he's been
a little distant lately.

04:49.348 --> 04:51.014
I thought
we were in a good place.

04:51.074 --> 04:54.034
You know, we collaborated on
a fun project a few months ago.

04:54.186 --> 04:55.961

What can you tell me?

05:16.767 --> 05:18.875
Jerry Chapman, 42 years old.

05:18.935 --> 05:20.652
Looks like
he jumped from the roof.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.062
Not sure yet
how he got up there.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.880
Did anyone see him fall?

05:23.899 --> 05:26.049
An inmate. He's over there.

05:26.109 --> 05:28.476
Lieutenant Arroyo.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.571
-What a surprise. (laughs)
-(sighs)

05:31.665 --> 05:34.482
You know, I-I'm happy

05:34.585 --> 05:36.001
I'm sure
you'll want my full statement.

05:36.194 --> 05:37.318
Yeah, why'd you do it?

05:37.421 --> 05:39.746
I am a witness.

05:39.898 --> 05:41.414
Did you see
where he jumped from?

05:41.567 --> 05:43.842
-Well, no.
-Not a very good witness,
are you?

05:44.035 --> 05:46.828
I saw him land,
but I did not see him jump.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.848
Suspicious, right?
I have a few thoughts.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.758
Don't worry.
There will be an autopsy,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.335
and I will take exactly nothing
you say into consideration.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.262
Lieutenant Arroy... Gilly,

05:56.398 --> 05:58.598
this was not a suicide.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.600
I was in therapy with Jerry
just a few hours ago.

06:00.752 --> 06:03.177
All he could talk about
was his impending freedom.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.030
And lobster.

06:05.181 --> 06:08.441
A man like that does not then
go and kill himself, does he?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.370
No. He doesn't.

06:12.230 --> 06:13.872
Edrisa?

06:14.065 --> 06:15.448
(sighs)

06:15.542 --> 06:17.617
Three of his fingernails
are bent back,

06:17.769 --> 06:19.285
and there's surface abrasions,
too.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.047
All signs of a struggle
from before he hit the ground.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.124
I'm not ready
to rule this a suicide.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.109
Thank you.

06:26.169 --> 06:28.294
Is that...

06:28.389 --> 06:30.296
It is.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.298
It's Martin Whitly. Okay.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.893
Okay, I'm gonna play it cool.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.288
Afternoon, Doctor.

06:38.306 --> 06:40.306
Did you see,
under his nails?

06:40.401 --> 06:42.734
The trace amounts of debris?

06:42.886 --> 06:46.463
It's most likely plaster,
perhaps from a wall...

06:46.481 --> 06:48.314
That he attempted
to grab, as he...

06:48.409 --> 06:49.633
Was pushed over the edge.

06:49.693 --> 06:51.134
Don't approach the psychopath.

06:51.194 --> 06:52.411
Oh, please, call me Martin.

06:52.604 --> 06:54.638
Thrilled to have
another physician here.

06:54.698 --> 06:56.306
We should talk bone fragments.

06:56.366 --> 06:59.159
Have you read the latest edition
of<i> The Lancet?</i>

06:59.311 --> 07:02.028
Twice. That piece
on craniocerebral injuries?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.255
Oh.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.648
I nearly spilled my chai.

07:04.708 --> 07:08.051
(both laughing)

07:13.049 --> 07:15.058
He killed 23 people.

07:16.127 --> 07:17.727
Cop-Copy that.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.777
(sighs)
I did my best,

07:25.970 --> 07:28.021
but she was definitely
in interrogator mode.

07:28.157 --> 07:31.265
Do you think
she suspects something?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.526
No. But be careful.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.178
You're next.

07:35.197 --> 07:36.362
I'll be fine.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.622
It's easier for me to lie.

07:37.815 --> 07:40.107
I don't actually
remember anything.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.018
Honestly...

07:42.078 --> 07:44.854
it'd be nice to remember more
from that night.

07:44.915 --> 07:46.523
Not really.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.616
You're lucky, Ains.

07:48.635 --> 07:52.378
Okay, you're not gonna talk to
me, but why can't I talk to Dad?

07:52.473 --> 07:53.955
You said he knows.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.215
What's the problem?

07:55.309 --> 07:56.883
Well, he's a serial killer.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.461
And it was
a traumatic experience.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.815
Your mind erased it
for a reason.

08:03.967 --> 08:07.802
You should focus on work,
and forget it ever happened.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.488
Glad you mentioned it.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.472
You know how I've been wanting
to get back in the studio?

08:11.575 --> 08:14.050
Well, I need a big story,

08:14.110 --> 08:17.662
so, I was thinking
"The Surgeon, Part Two."

08:17.855 --> 08:19.906
No, Ainsley,
that's a horrible idea.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.574
(phone buzzing)

08:21.668 --> 08:23.317
Is that... is that Gil?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.912
Is there a story?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.248
-Okay, here's the deal.
-Okay.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.582
I'll let you in on this case

08:29.676 --> 08:32.326
if you stop asking
about that night

08:32.346 --> 08:34.679
and you promise not to see Dad.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.423
Okay, fine.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.425
(buzzing continues)

08:39.520 --> 08:41.261

08:59.873 --> 09:02.916
Okay, drink.
Chug, chug.

09:04.736 --> 09:06.503
Attaboy.
Let's go!

09:10.658 --> 09:11.716
JESSICA:
Great news! I found it!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.943
The Scotch you hid
in my dollhouse?

09:14.004 --> 09:16.704
Honey, no.
I drained that at your sweet 16.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.115
The perfect rug
for the living room!

09:19.175 --> 09:20.800
Now you don't have
to feel bad anymore.

09:20.952 --> 09:22.727
It's a similar pattern.
See?

09:23.888 --> 09:27.457
-Um...
-Darling, are you okay?

09:27.559 --> 09:28.975
Yeah. No.

09:29.127 --> 09:30.810
Uh, slipped.
Uh, it looks great.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.813
You've been so clumsy lately,
like with the-the wine.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.316
What... what kind
of bottle was it again?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.802
A 2007 Syrah.
Look, I've got to run.

09:38.862 --> 09:40.412
-Mm?
-I'm on a story.

09:40.605 --> 09:42.322
-Don't wait up, okay?
-(laughing): Okay.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.457
-Okay.
-Good luck.

09:51.616 --> 09:55.318
So I found a set of antemortem
bruises on Jerry's shoulders,

09:55.420 --> 09:59.080
which suggests he was shoved
back before he was pushed.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.749
This was a fight.
Someone was angry with him.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.020
<i> MARTIN (on phone):</i>
<i> Exactly what I was thinking.</i>

10:07.024 --> 10:08.756
Is that...

10:08.859 --> 10:10.442
EDRISA:
Yes. Sorry. I...

10:10.635 --> 10:12.185
had to call Dr. Whitly

10:12.321 --> 10:15.688
to ask if he knew what angle
our victim landed,

10:15.824 --> 10:17.507
and then
we got to talking, and...

10:17.567 --> 10:18.617
<i> MARTIN:</i>
<i> It's obvious, son.</i>

10:18.768 --> 10:20.285
This was an inside job.

10:20.478 --> 10:23.847
<i> Not just inside Claremont,</i>
<i> inside group therapy.</i>

10:23.907 --> 10:25.957
I saw it all, clear as day.

10:26.150 --> 10:29.519
Every single patient
in our circle

10:29.621 --> 10:32.113
looked positively murderous

10:32.174 --> 10:34.132
<i>as Jerry bragged about leaving.</i>

10:34.283 --> 10:35.783
<i> That's six good suspects.</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:38.637
<i> I'll have Mr. David</i>
<i> fax over the nam...</i>

10:38.788 --> 10:40.055
You need
to make some new friends.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.867
He may be onto something.

10:43.927 --> 10:46.035
Jerry's release
may have triggered

10:46.096 --> 10:49.038
abandonment anxiety
in his fellow patients.

10:49.099 --> 10:52.375
We all experience it
when someone gets engaged

10:52.435 --> 10:54.135
or promoted instead of us.

10:54.196 --> 10:57.714
Like my friend who...

10:57.774 --> 11:01.308
kept posting photos
of her wedding in the Galapagos.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.403
It's like,
"Yeah, we get it, Carly.

11:03.555 --> 11:04.829
"You saw some turtles

11:04.981 --> 11:07.374
and you married my high school
boyfriend. Ugh."

11:11.004 --> 11:13.654
But, you know,
I've seen plenty of turtles.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.581
MARTIN:
So, what's the plan?

11:15.734 --> 11:17.825
Toss some cells?
Put the place in lockdown?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.844
You know, we could always
run down a few suspects,

11:19.996 --> 11:22.088
play, uh, good cop, bad cop...

11:22.240 --> 11:23.831
predatory psychopath.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.017
We're not here to discuss
case strategy. You're a witness.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.593
Why can't I be a peer?

11:27.688 --> 11:30.021
Why, you've shown
so much affection

11:30.190 --> 11:31.172
to my son.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.816
And my wife.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.085
Why no love for the man

11:36.104 --> 11:38.905
who actually
gave you your career?

11:40.483 --> 11:41.849
Wait, wait.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.776
Dr. Whitly,

11:43.870 --> 11:47.021
when Jerry was talking about
leaving Claremont in group,

11:47.082 --> 11:50.099
you mentioned some patients
exhibited stress responses.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.060
Maybe.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.879
-I'm gonna need
a little more than that.
-MARTIN: So am I.

11:55.072 --> 11:58.291
Come on.
A murder in Claremont?

11:58.385 --> 11:59.959
Oh, this is the dream.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.219
I want to help you.

12:01.412 --> 12:04.538
I really, really do.
But, uh...

12:04.558 --> 12:07.133
You know, I do not like

12:07.227 --> 12:09.376
these dynamics one bit.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.896
I want to be part of the team.

12:22.025 --> 12:23.149
Okay.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.909
We'll work together.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.894
Now,

12:26.913 --> 12:28.913
-what did you witness
in group therapy?
-MARTIN: I think

12:29.065 --> 12:33.142
three of my friends
had acute stress responses.

12:33.161 --> 12:37.404
Hector, uh, Burt and Friar Pete.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.423
Great.
We'll go talk to them.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.074
MARTIN:
Oh, good luck with that.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.927
It's taken Dr. Marsh years
to get those fellas

12:43.120 --> 12:46.055
to say even a few words
about themselves.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.582
What do you suggest?

12:48.685 --> 12:51.418
So, my next group therapy
session starts in an hour.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.105
Now, today,
Dr. Marsh will invite

12:54.298 --> 12:56.165
a skilled profiler

12:56.226 --> 12:58.501
to discuss Jerry's case.

12:58.561 --> 13:00.278
The two of us together,

13:00.471 --> 13:02.280
we'll get the truth out of them.

13:02.473 --> 13:04.282
Come on.

13:04.475 --> 13:06.618
It'll be fun!

13:06.769 --> 13:07.935
What's your standing
in this group?

13:07.996 --> 13:10.680
-Do they respect you?
-They love me.

13:10.698 --> 13:12.457
-They hate you, don't they?
-Definitely.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.126
Good.
We can work with that.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.946
You think
we're gonna help the cops?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.356
Nobody say nothing.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.133
-I'm with Hector.
-I'm with God.

13:22.285 --> 13:24.618
MARTIN:
Okay, come on, now.
Look, let's... (clears throat)

13:24.679 --> 13:26.029
let's give him a chance.

13:26.089 --> 13:28.714
You know, he's, uh,
he's one of us,

13:28.809 --> 13:31.367
after all, you know?
He understands

13:31.427 --> 13:34.729
our inner torture, uh...

13:36.191 --> 13:38.358
Because he's a skilled profiler.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.376
So I've heard.

13:40.436 --> 13:42.303
Wait.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.322
This is Malcolm.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.640
The son
you're always talking about?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.475
All good, I promise.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.079
-(chuckles softly)
-HECTOR: Dude got fired
from the FBI.

13:52.115 --> 13:53.573
Chopped a guy's hand off.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.483
-Smashed his own with a hammer.
-FRIAR PETE: Hmm.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.485
He's got a thing with hands?

13:58.547 --> 14:00.821
HECTOR:
Bro, you're crazier than me.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.232
(chuckles) I'm not sure
that's true, Hector.

14:03.251 --> 14:06.085
You did gut your mother's
boyfriend with a fire poker.

14:06.237 --> 14:08.071
MARSH:
Malcolm,

14:08.073 --> 14:11.182
-we like to focus
on positives here.
-BRIGHT: Of course.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.334
Okay, let's get down to it.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.927
I'm here to catch a killer.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.171
(Martin laughing)

14:17.232 --> 14:19.023
Sorry.
It's just, um,

14:19.216 --> 14:22.343
that tickled me,
you know, because, um,

14:22.404 --> 14:24.511
your catching a killer

14:24.573 --> 14:26.513
didn't work out as a positive

14:26.575 --> 14:28.867
-for me. (chuckles)
-HECTOR: Yeah, Malc.

14:29.018 --> 14:31.518
Calling the cops
on your old man? That's cold.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.945
Probably hurt as bad

14:33.098 --> 14:34.873
as a fire poker in the gut,
didn't it, Doc?

14:35.066 --> 14:36.916
Oh, it stung.

14:39.771 --> 14:41.270
MARSH:
Guys,

14:41.331 --> 14:43.456
let's talk about Jerry.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.441
Thank you, Dr. Marsh.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.886
(clears throat)
Did Jerry ever...

14:48.054 --> 14:50.463
BURT:
I couldn't do that to my dad.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.058
You must have really hated him.

14:58.514 --> 15:01.307
No. No.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.309
I loved him.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.736
(chuckles):
I...

15:04.887 --> 15:07.071
I always wanted
to be around him.

15:07.264 --> 15:09.240
Learn from him.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.968
I wanted to be

15:12.028 --> 15:14.654
just like my dad.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.064
Until I found a girl in a box

15:17.083 --> 15:19.918
and realized
he was a serial killer.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.253
FRIAR PETE:
That must have been
confusing for you

15:22.422 --> 15:24.313
as a child.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.257
It destroyed me.

15:26.450 --> 15:29.152
<i> He</i> destroyed me.

15:29.212 --> 15:30.653
MARTIN:
My boy,

15:30.755 --> 15:32.764
you-you-you've got it all wrong.

15:32.957 --> 15:35.324
Come on, you all...
you all know me.

15:35.385 --> 15:37.843
You know I'm a... a good man.

15:37.996 --> 15:41.272
Son, I-I only wanted to share

15:41.465 --> 15:42.774
what was most important to me.

15:42.967 --> 15:44.500
BRIGHT:
I was a kid,

15:44.560 --> 15:47.111
and you showed me horrible,

15:47.304 --> 15:48.838
gruesome things,

15:48.898 --> 15:51.691
and-and then you wanted
to talk about it.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.361
It was the only way
I could be close to you.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.363
By listening to you.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.516
No.
<i> Becoming</i> you.

16:00.576 --> 16:02.443
Let's-let's focus
on the positives, son.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.703
BRIGHT:
There aren't any!

16:03.855 --> 16:05.521
You wanted to turn me
into a monster,

16:05.623 --> 16:08.508
a monster like you!

16:19.020 --> 16:21.521
Sorry.
Um...

16:24.859 --> 16:27.902
(sighs)
Maybe this was a bad idea.

16:28.938 --> 16:31.564
How 'bout we take a break?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.382
HECTOR:
Don't be sorry, man.

16:33.443 --> 16:36.385
Change comes with pain.

16:36.446 --> 16:38.162
Jer used to say that.

16:38.355 --> 16:39.998
FRIAR PETE:
It's true.

16:40.191 --> 16:43.084
He was on a righteous journey
himself. Cut too short.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.582
Uh...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.992
were you upset to see him go?

16:52.012 --> 16:53.660
HECTOR:
You're asking
the wrong question, Malc.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.738
You want to find his killer,
answer this:

16:55.757 --> 16:57.664
how'd Jerry get on the roof?

16:57.726 --> 16:59.759
Did he have a key card on him?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.502
No. Why?

17:01.563 --> 17:02.928
HECTOR:
You need a card

17:03.081 --> 17:04.188
to exit a secure area.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.432
Only one card
opens all the doors.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.084
The gold card.

17:08.186 --> 17:10.528
Gold? Really?

17:10.721 --> 17:12.438
Dr. Marsh, who-who might have

17:12.590 --> 17:15.925
one of these
elusive gold key cards?

17:15.943 --> 17:18.036
I'm not gonna discuss that here.

17:18.229 --> 17:20.354
Well, do you...

17:20.415 --> 17:22.189
have one?
Correct me

17:22.250 --> 17:25.768
if I'm wrong, son,
but it's not uncommon

17:25.828 --> 17:29.047
for therapists
to have a savior complex.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.291
What if

17:32.443 --> 17:34.552
Dr. Marsh here couldn't stand

17:34.745 --> 17:36.888
that Jerry
didn't need him anymore?

17:37.039 --> 17:39.390
-You don't really think...
-No.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.393
No, of course not.

17:43.387 --> 17:45.396
Though... I would like

17:45.589 --> 17:47.482
to see what color key card
you have.

18:00.972 --> 18:03.656
It's gold!
You killed Jerry!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.308
-You killed Jerry!
-(grunts)

18:05.326 --> 18:06.751
-(alarm blaring)
-GUARD: Let's go!

18:06.902 --> 18:07.993
-Up against the wall! Move!
-You killed Jerry!

18:08.146 --> 18:09.570
-MARSH: Get him off me.
-Come on,

18:09.589 --> 18:10.588
we got to get out of here.
Wait right there.

18:10.739 --> 18:11.923
Down to the ground!

18:12.092 --> 18:14.550
-(overlapping shouting)
-(alarm blaring)

18:22.143 --> 18:23.750
Espinal says you were issued
a new key card an hour ago.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.419
You told him
you lost the old one.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.105
Which is odd,
because your old key card

18:27.256 --> 18:30.316
-accessed multiple locations
this morning.
-It...

18:31.319 --> 18:33.736
It must have been stolen.

18:38.234 --> 18:40.618
You're lying to us, Dr. Marsh.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.957
You have to understand.

18:47.243 --> 18:50.944
I haven't had a successful
patient outcome in years.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.191
Jerry's release
was my chance to show

18:55.251 --> 18:57.301
my therapy can work.

18:58.588 --> 19:00.045
Maybe get a publication
out of it.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.864
DANI:
Assuming Jerry told everyone

19:01.883 --> 19:04.200
that you cured him,
not The Surgeon.

19:04.260 --> 19:07.036
He agreed to lie.
In exchange...

19:07.096 --> 19:08.204
He wanted a key card.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.055
MARSH:
Just for a few hours.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.316
Uh, t-to say goodbye to friends.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.527
You don't know
what it's like in here.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.905
We're prisoners, too.

19:19.942 --> 19:21.308
Roll.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.643
Lieutenant Arroyo,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.403
is Dr. Marsh under arrest?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.814
Does this have anything to do
with the death of Jerry Chapman?

19:27.876 --> 19:29.041
No comment.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.378
(engine starts)

19:33.831 --> 19:35.631
Please tell me
you can do better.

19:36.401 --> 19:38.025
Off the record,

19:38.052 --> 19:39.844
-I don't think we have our guy.
-So the killer's in there?

19:40.037 --> 19:42.588
Yeah. Along with a bunch
of other killers.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.164
I got to get back inside.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.725
Malcolm, we need to talk.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.853
It's about that night.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.913
I know, it was bad.

19:50.932 --> 19:52.431
Forgetting is good.
But...

19:52.525 --> 19:54.917
I remembered something.

19:54.936 --> 19:57.528
Hey, hey, not-not here.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.365
A knife.

20:01.558 --> 20:03.350
And blood.
A lot of blood.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.036
On my hands, even.

20:05.229 --> 20:06.445
Yeah, there was blood.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.113
Everywhere.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.282
And then you tried to save him,

20:10.418 --> 20:12.526
so it got on you, too.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.546
-I-I got to get back inside.
-Wait.

20:15.698 --> 20:17.030
You're the only one
I can share this with.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.633
You're the only one
who knows the truth.

20:21.078 --> 20:22.778
I'm sorry, Ains.

20:22.838 --> 20:24.964
We'll talk about this later.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.615
I promise.

20:26.717 --> 20:29.727
Right now,
I have to go talk to Dad.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.804
(mouths)

20:31.898 --> 20:33.731
You and me both.

20:34.758 --> 20:38.143
To think Dr. Marsh would let
Jerry borrow his key card.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.146
-Well, question is...
-Do we believe his story?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.982
Exactly.
What if Jerry said no

20:43.076 --> 20:45.058
to his madcap scheme?
What if he

20:45.078 --> 20:46.893
-threatened to go to the warden?
-That'd definitely be motive.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.062
(chuckles): Oh, man,
we are cooking with gas.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.766
Oh, you were amazing in group.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.918
You know, the two of us
playing off each other.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.978
I hate you, I love you.

20:55.997 --> 20:59.423
Right out
of<i> Inside the Actors Studio.</i>

20:59.616 --> 21:00.800
(clears throat)
What?

21:01.919 --> 21:03.652
You keep glancing at this.

21:03.713 --> 21:05.654
You're trying to be subtle,

21:05.715 --> 21:07.556
but your optokinetic reflexes
give you away.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.061
It's a shiny object.
Relax.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.755
What lion

21:14.816 --> 21:17.108
doesn't dream of the savanna?
(stammers)

21:17.259 --> 21:20.185
Nobody escapes from a cell
like this. Come on. What is it?

21:20.321 --> 21:22.738
Is something else bothering you?

21:25.843 --> 21:27.601
(sighs) Ainsley's
started to remember things.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.695
About that night.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.347
Really?

21:31.407 --> 21:33.124
What are you gonna do?

21:33.275 --> 21:34.683
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

21:34.744 --> 21:36.885
Hey.
Espinal found

21:36.912 --> 21:38.854
a tape of Jerry
using a gold key card

21:38.914 --> 21:40.280
to enter
the fourth-floor library

21:40.341 --> 21:41.524
just before he was killed.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.192
So Marsh was telling the truth.

21:43.252 --> 21:44.360
And your suspects just doubled.

21:44.420 --> 21:45.861
Why, what's on the fourth floor?

21:45.880 --> 21:48.455
Well, that's Ward Z.
The women's ward.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.549
Oh, it's a magical place,
I hear.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.368
There's a women's ward?

21:52.428 --> 21:53.853
Yeah.
We should go.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.043
Wow.
It's nice?

22:01.103 --> 22:02.728
Smells like lavender.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.881
-Hmm.
-Lemon verbena, actually.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.991
BRIGHT:
Good to know.

22:07.184 --> 22:08.159
And you are?

22:08.352 --> 22:09.718
Andre.

22:09.737 --> 22:11.812
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

22:11.873 --> 22:14.832
Look, we keep this zone
locked up.

22:15.025 --> 22:17.001
Jerry should never
have been here.

22:17.194 --> 22:18.669
I think
Jerry would agree with you.

22:18.862 --> 22:20.671
There are scratch marks
on the frame.

22:20.864 --> 22:23.490
Pretty sure they match the color
of the paint chips

22:23.551 --> 22:25.325
Edrisa found
under Jerry's fingernails.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.069
Looks like
we found our crime scene.

22:27.088 --> 22:29.588
So, he came up here
to say goodbye to someone.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.666
And within five minutes,
was pushed out this window.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.910
I'm guessing the farewell
didn't go as planned.

22:34.929 --> 22:36.503
Except the library was closed.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.171
Closed doesn't mean empty.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.357
Andre,

22:39.550 --> 22:41.341
-who else has access?
-Admin,

22:41.402 --> 22:43.510
us guards, a cleaning crew.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.512
Who's on the cleaning crew?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.347
Female inmates.
Four of 'em.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.182
BRIGHT:
That's it.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.202
One of those women was not happy

22:51.395 --> 22:52.611
that Jerry was leaving her.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.354
You think he had a girlfriend?

22:54.374 --> 22:56.115
It fits the profile.

22:56.267 --> 22:59.451
Romantic abandonment can turn
to psychotic jealousy fast.

22:59.604 --> 23:01.770
But it would have to be someone

23:01.831 --> 23:04.106
who's stuck here
for a long time.

23:04.125 --> 23:08.460
Andre, how well do you know
these four women?

23:08.554 --> 23:10.295
-Any lifers?
-All but Carla.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.556
She's due to be released
next month.

23:12.749 --> 23:15.801
Great.
We can rule her out. See?

23:15.953 --> 23:17.895
We are already down to three.

23:18.088 --> 23:19.246
Anyone over 60?

23:19.248 --> 23:21.306
-No.
-Uh,

23:21.401 --> 23:23.292
any with a history of violence?

23:23.352 --> 23:24.735
-All of 'em.
-Physical prowess.

23:24.928 --> 23:27.345
Who could push Jerry
out that window?

23:27.407 --> 23:31.150
Well, Mariana is six, three.

23:31.302 --> 23:33.469
She's real crazy.

23:33.487 --> 23:34.820
Sounds like a good suspect.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.582
Mm. Strength is good,
but height is bad.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.643
Jerry's ego
would still be bruised

23:40.661 --> 23:42.420
after his last
psychotic episode.

23:42.613 --> 23:44.480
He would want
to feel like the alpha.

23:44.498 --> 23:46.239
So we can rule her out, too.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.425
Who's left?

23:47.618 --> 23:48.742
ANDRE:
Rhonda and Ming.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.912
They're average-sized ladies.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.764
Should we do
"eeny meeny miney mo"?

23:53.957 --> 23:56.175
Kidding. I'm just shocked
you haven't gotten it down

23:56.327 --> 23:59.586
-to one yet.
-Who says I haven't?
My father said

23:59.689 --> 24:03.499
that Jerry could not
stop talking about lobster.

24:03.559 --> 24:05.517
But he's from Kentucky,

24:05.670 --> 24:08.279
so where did his love
of crustaceans come from?

24:08.472 --> 24:10.263
Come on.
They can't possibly be...

24:10.324 --> 24:12.841
Uh. Andre,

24:12.860 --> 24:16.370
-where's Ming from?
-Midwest, I think?

24:17.314 --> 24:19.014
Rhonda's from Maine.

24:19.074 --> 24:20.499
(snaps fingers)

24:20.651 --> 24:22.367
You got a suspect from lobster?

24:22.520 --> 24:23.852
Well, I could have asked

24:23.954 --> 24:26.371
about early childhood trauma
and how it leads

24:26.466 --> 24:28.114
to insecure-resistant
attachment style,

24:28.217 --> 24:29.967
but what's the fun in that?

24:30.118 --> 24:31.785
<i> (buzzer sounds)</i>

24:31.846 --> 24:33.712
<i> JESSICA:</i>
<i> Before you</i>
<i> say anything perverse,</i>

24:33.864 --> 24:35.197
<i> this is not a social call.</i>

24:35.257 --> 24:36.699
<i> -It is about our children.</i>
-(door closes)

24:36.759 --> 24:39.034
A co-parenting inquiry?

24:39.094 --> 24:40.536
Even better.

24:40.596 --> 24:42.629
Lay it on me, Jess.

24:42.690 --> 24:46.150
If you spilled a random bottle
of wine months ago,

24:46.301 --> 24:48.861
would you remember
the exact vintage?

24:49.805 --> 24:51.547
<i> No, you wouldn't.</i>

24:51.565 --> 24:54.383
Unless it was a story you had
rehearsed a thousand times.

24:54.443 --> 24:55.384
That's what I thought.

24:55.402 --> 24:56.735
<i> Well, happy to help.</i>

24:56.829 --> 25:00.222
Uh, may I inquire
what I'm helping with?

25:00.282 --> 25:01.523
<i> Grandma Milton's favorite rug.</i>

25:01.542 --> 25:03.483
The one that Ataturk gave her.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.485
Malcolm and Ainsley
threw it out.

25:05.588 --> 25:09.322
<i> And they have this perfect</i>
<i> cover story.</i>

25:09.425 --> 25:10.824
I know that tone, darling.

25:10.885 --> 25:14.069
<i> Very 1997.</i>
<i> A little paranoid,</i>

25:14.088 --> 25:15.328
aren't we?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.589
What am I doing?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.350
They wouldn't
confide in you anyway.

25:19.543 --> 25:22.836
Oh.
Wouldn't they?

25:22.897 --> 25:24.188
(sighs)

25:24.357 --> 25:26.357
<i> Try me, Jess.</i>

25:26.508 --> 25:28.250
Ask me

25:28.352 --> 25:30.176
what you're too afraid to ask.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.655
Oh.

25:38.895 --> 25:40.871
(sighs)

25:42.416 --> 25:45.209
The night the rug got ruined.

25:45.402 --> 25:47.586
(sighs)

25:49.924 --> 25:52.775
It was the night that
Nicholas Endicott disappeared.

25:52.835 --> 25:54.385
That's not a question.

25:54.578 --> 25:57.054
Ask... the question.

26:01.418 --> 26:02.467
I can't.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.303
Good, because it's ridiculous.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.623
<i> Do you really think</i>

26:07.641 --> 26:09.792
your children killed him?

26:09.852 --> 26:12.218
And then, what,
wrapped his body in the ru...

26:12.321 --> 26:15.480
(laughing):
in the rug

26:15.633 --> 26:19.151
and shipped him to Estonia?

26:19.287 --> 26:21.061
<i> (cackles)</i>

26:21.122 --> 26:23.305
Okay, okay.
(laughs)

26:24.642 --> 26:27.901
Perhaps I was letting myself
get a little carried away.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.403
<i> Well, don't beat yourself up</i>
<i> too much.</i>

26:30.464 --> 26:32.923
They are my children,
too, after all.

26:33.116 --> 26:36.552
Apples don't fall
that far from the tree.

26:38.589 --> 26:41.490
-(door closes)
-Ooh, got to run.

26:41.508 --> 26:43.100
Uh, let's do this again
next time

26:43.293 --> 26:45.436
you suspect our children
of arson or grand theft auto.

26:45.629 --> 26:47.688
<i> -Bye now.</i>
-(hangs up)

26:48.608 --> 26:51.025
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

26:53.562 --> 26:55.904
My dear girl.

26:58.993 --> 27:01.410
It's been too long.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.672
(door closes, lock clicks)

27:14.634 --> 27:16.783
Rhonda Young?

27:17.678 --> 27:20.638
I'm here
to talk about Jerry Chapman.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.516
Just leave me alone.

27:25.427 --> 27:27.552
I know this is hard.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.371
You loved him.

27:29.431 --> 27:31.056
You must be in pain.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.359
You have no idea.

27:34.436 --> 27:36.654
He was good to me.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.615
Real good.

27:40.517 --> 27:41.992
It's all my fault.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.219
What did you do, Rhonda?

27:44.279 --> 27:46.221
Nothing.

27:46.281 --> 27:48.056
That's the problem.

27:48.117 --> 27:51.085
I should have done more.
He was scared.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.463
Who was Jerry scared of?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.051
Another inmate.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.829
He wanted to escape.

28:02.890 --> 28:06.074
Jerry refused to help,
but this guy wouldn't let up.

28:06.093 --> 28:08.727
Wouldn't take no.

28:10.213 --> 28:12.022
He's terrifying.

28:12.215 --> 28:13.857
Do you know his name?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.069
They call him The Surgeon.

28:24.278 --> 28:25.518
(door closes)

28:25.579 --> 28:26.929
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:26.989 --> 28:28.855
Well, she's my daughter,
Malcolm.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.783
Is there some reason why
the two of us can't catch up?

28:31.877 --> 28:34.244
AINSLEY:
I needed someone
to talk to about my memory,

28:34.396 --> 28:35.546
and you wouldn't listen.

28:35.697 --> 28:36.638
He's the only other person
who knows.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.198
Well, you can't talk to him.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.791
(laughs) I can't talk to him,
I can't talk to you.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.778
This is insane.
I feel like I'm going insane.

28:42.796 --> 28:43.721
You're not, I promise.

28:43.914 --> 28:46.640
What aren't you telling me?

28:51.922 --> 28:53.522
He killed Jerry.

28:55.142 --> 28:57.884
Is that the official position
of the NYPD?

28:57.987 --> 29:00.738
-It's not a news story.
-Or true.

29:00.931 --> 29:03.223
If I can get a second source
to confirm it, I'm running it.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.484
And for the record,

29:05.578 --> 29:09.154
I don't know
which one of you is lying.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.489
(knocking)

29:10.583 --> 29:12.833
(buzzer sounds)

29:14.253 --> 29:15.994
(sighs)

29:16.146 --> 29:17.254
-(door closes)
-(lock clicks)

29:17.423 --> 29:19.923
Wow, this family.

29:20.075 --> 29:21.925
I mean, everyone's
on a hunt for the truth.

29:22.118 --> 29:23.243
Do you need an antacid?

29:23.304 --> 29:24.653
I feel like I need an antacid.

29:24.713 --> 29:26.154
You can drop the act.

29:26.256 --> 29:29.157
We spoke to Jerry's girlfriend,
Rhonda.

29:29.218 --> 29:30.826
She told us everything.

29:30.886 --> 29:33.253
Dani's talking to Espinal.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.439
You're going back into Solitary.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.274
You weren't dreaming
of the wild.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.443
You wanted to escape.

29:39.636 --> 29:42.905
And Jerry wouldn't help you,
so you killed him.

29:44.525 --> 29:48.118
One: uh, while escape
sounds lovely,

29:48.270 --> 29:50.846
I'm chained to a wall,

29:50.906 --> 29:52.364
remember?

29:52.516 --> 29:55.350
Um, two: who's Rhonda?

29:55.452 --> 29:58.036
And three:
Jerry nearly fell on me.

29:58.188 --> 29:59.688
How could I have pushed him?

29:59.748 --> 30:02.357
No, but you could have
manipulated someone to do it.

30:02.417 --> 30:04.526
-Oh.
-Remember Tevin?

30:04.586 --> 30:06.786
-John Watkins?
-Honestly, son,

30:06.847 --> 30:08.421
everything
you're describing sounds

30:08.516 --> 30:10.198
like a whole lot of hard work.

30:10.217 --> 30:11.867
You're a psychopath.

30:11.927 --> 30:15.871
You don't care who you lie to,
who you hurt or kill.

30:15.931 --> 30:18.056
I knew it.
I-I knew it.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.375
Your little breakdown
in group wasn't just for show.

30:20.435 --> 30:22.152
You really feel that way
about me.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.304
Because I can't trust you!

30:24.365 --> 30:28.383
I should never have come today.
It's exactly what you wanted.

30:28.443 --> 30:29.642
Oh, oh, this is what I wanted?

30:29.703 --> 30:31.053
(laughs)
Oh, that is...

30:31.113 --> 30:33.163
that is the single
dumbest profile

30:33.315 --> 30:35.073
in the history of profiles.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.667
Because if I really

30:36.860 --> 30:41.413
were the cold-blooded psychopath
you think I am...

30:41.565 --> 30:43.156
I would hate you.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.842
Oh, not for any of this.

30:45.035 --> 30:47.586
No, no, no.
No, for destroying my life.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.180
20 years ago, you turned me in!

30:50.373 --> 30:51.998
Your own father!

30:52.059 --> 30:54.000
You ruined me!

30:54.061 --> 30:55.501
And your mother!

30:55.563 --> 30:58.480
And you ruined her!

31:00.401 --> 31:02.526
But that's not me.

31:02.719 --> 31:04.695
Also, I wouldn't kill Jerry,

31:04.888 --> 31:06.363
because you're very good
at this.

31:06.514 --> 31:09.925
You'd solve the crime,
and you'd never come back.

31:09.985 --> 31:14.613
Why would Rhonda
try to pin this on you?

31:14.765 --> 31:16.356
Have you ever met her?

31:16.417 --> 31:18.876
No.
But celebrities--

31:19.027 --> 31:20.210
you know, they're easy targets.

31:20.403 --> 31:21.920
It's the burden we bear.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.774
This felt personal.

31:25.834 --> 31:28.802
What did you do
to Rhonda, specifically?

31:31.965 --> 31:33.298
You cured Jerry.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.618
You're the reason
he was being released.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.511
You stole her love from her.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.305
Tell me about Rhonda Young.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.899
She and Jerry were an item?

31:42.092 --> 31:44.292
She's a patient of mine,
but I didn't know

31:44.353 --> 31:47.029
<i> about Jerry. I thought</i>
<i> she had another boyfriend.</i>

31:50.451 --> 31:52.317
<i> -GIL: Another boyfriend?</i>
<i> -MARSH: She's been hinting</i>

31:52.411 --> 31:54.302

31:56.081 --> 31:57.397

<i> of the guards on that wing.</i>

31:57.458 --> 31:58.790
His name's Andre.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.255
Lieutenant Arroyo?

32:05.448 --> 32:07.832
Make sure you watch out
for the explosive rage.

32:07.985 --> 32:10.152
-From Andre?
-No.

32:10.212 --> 32:11.887

I didn't kill Jerry.

(alarm blaring)

32:48.358 --> 32:50.525
We don't need to go
to Solitary, Mr. David.

32:50.585 --> 32:52.952
I... I'm actually innocent
this time.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.529
Mr. David.

32:54.589 --> 32:56.456
Rhonda's escaped,
but she's still in the building.

32:56.517 --> 32:57.699

she's coming for my father.

32:57.759 --> 32:59.534

32:59.594 --> 33:01.395

This must be Rhonda.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.753
She stole the guard's keycard.

33:28.490 --> 33:31.508
Clever girl.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.560
