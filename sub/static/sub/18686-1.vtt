00:03.170 --> 00:06.255
Falcon to Deathstalker, come in.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.966
Falcon to Deathstalker, do you read me?

00:08.967 --> 00:11.594
Holden, pick up!

00:13.180 --> 00:14.847
Dude, are you there?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.183
Where are you?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.312
Dammit, Holden! Pick up!

00:21.313 --> 00:22.615
Oh, it sounds like he's testing you.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.365
- Hol, I've been up here for like an hour!
- You've got to be strong.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.716
Oh, I know it's a bit rocky now,

00:26.741 --> 00:28.986
But you gotta...

00:28.987 --> 00:31.405
Wait, he said what?

00:31.406 --> 00:33.146
Oh, you know what?

00:33.171 --> 00:35.654
It's just a phase. Yeah,
Holden was the same way.

00:35.679 --> 00:36.732
No, it's the age.

00:36.757 --> 00:38.216
Luke, no!

00:38.455 --> 00:41.271
Luke, honey, we're having
dinner in 20 minutes, okay?

00:41.296 --> 00:43.013
- But I'm hungry!
- I know, sweetheart.

00:43.061 --> 00:44.505
You know what? Take
this to your brother.

00:44.514 --> 00:46.473
- Sue, I'm so sorry.
- Astronomers and stargazers...

00:46.474 --> 00:48.558
Whoa, slow down there, buddy.

00:48.559 --> 00:51.853
Slow down. You see this?
Look, look, look, look.

00:51.854 --> 00:53.647
There's gonna be a meteor shower.

00:53.648 --> 00:55.524
Closest one to the Earth this century.

00:55.525 --> 00:56.983
Dad!

00:56.984 --> 00:59.779
- Bye!
- No running in the house!

01:10.373 --> 01:12.291
Hang in there, Max. Almost done.

01:16.754 --> 01:17.963
Falcon to Deathstalker,

01:17.964 --> 01:19.089
come in.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.674
Here, it's for you.

01:20.675 --> 01:22.300
Come on, man. Pick up.

01:22.301 --> 01:23.927
Falcon, Falcon, this is Deathstalker.

01:23.928 --> 01:25.184
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I'm on my way. Over.

01:25.209 --> 01:27.055
Finally you answered!

01:27.080 --> 01:28.278
- I've only been trying...
- What's that?

01:28.303 --> 01:29.659
... to talk to you all night.

01:29.684 --> 01:31.018
Get the door.

01:40.685 --> 01:41.811
You ready?

01:51.622 --> 01:53.206
I like the red one.

01:54.124 --> 01:55.769
Yeah, me too. That's Mars.

01:57.382 --> 01:59.546
Can I come with you
to watch the meteors?

01:59.547 --> 02:01.172
Not tonight, little man.

02:01.173 --> 02:02.773
Then when?

02:03.384 --> 02:05.359
Next time. I promise.

02:08.556 --> 02:11.766
Hey, I, uh, I do have a
very important job for you.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.518
You gotta stay here and take
care of Max for me, okay?

02:13.519 --> 02:15.532
Make sure he eats all his dinner.

02:15.557 --> 02:16.974
Can you handle that?

02:17.113 --> 02:19.149
You swear on the Holy Secret
Covenant of Brotherhood?

02:19.150 --> 02:21.215
There's no such thing.

02:22.832 --> 02:25.762
I swear on the Holy Secret
Covenant of Brotherhood.

02:27.073 --> 02:28.316
All right.

02:29.493 --> 02:30.916
Gonna go out to meet Kevin!

02:30.941 --> 02:31.995
Hey, it's a school night!

02:31.996 --> 02:32.981
- Be back by 10:00!
- Bye!

02:33.006 --> 02:34.231
I mean it, Holden!

03:22.004 --> 03:23.588
Holden, hurry your ass up here.

03:23.589 --> 03:25.215
I think I saw something!

03:25.216 --> 03:27.509
Dude! Where have you been?

03:30.429 --> 03:31.721
Whew.

03:31.722 --> 03:34.683
High school girls, high school women.

03:34.684 --> 03:36.977
It's gonna be awesome.

03:36.978 --> 03:38.979
Aren't they all the same
girls we knew in middle school,

03:38.980 --> 03:40.939
just without braces?

03:41.651 --> 03:44.153
You're just saying that 'cause
you're too afraid to talk to 'em.

03:44.443 --> 03:46.400
No, I'm... I'm not afraid.

03:47.405 --> 03:50.949
And besides, what girls
do you ever talk to ever?

03:51.114 --> 03:52.781
I... I talk to some.

03:53.297 --> 03:54.392
Who?

03:54.704 --> 03:55.787
What...

03:55.788 --> 03:57.622
Uh...

03:57.623 --> 03:59.164
Julie. From summer camp.

03:59.189 --> 04:00.517
You don't know her.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.459
Yeah.

04:07.466 --> 04:10.468
Did you know there's over
100 billion stars up there?

04:10.469 --> 04:12.512
And they're all different.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.998
Yeah, so?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.170
"So"?

04:17.195 --> 04:20.654
Don't you ever feel like we're
a part of something bigger?

04:21.113 --> 04:23.242
I feel like...

04:24.483 --> 04:25.734
I'm drunk.

04:26.281 --> 04:29.284
Yeah, I'm drunk.

04:32.366 --> 04:34.279
- Oh no.
- What? What is it?

04:35.139 --> 04:37.183
- The cops?
- Worse.

04:47.411 --> 04:48.872
_

04:58.866 --> 05:00.286
You owe me a six pack.

05:00.311 --> 05:01.728
- Ass-face!
- It's Dad's beer, Jeff!

05:01.729 --> 05:03.396
I got as much right to it as you do!

05:03.397 --> 05:04.981
The beer is gone, okay?

05:04.982 --> 05:06.192
So just piss off!

05:07.401 --> 05:08.777
Funny...

05:08.778 --> 05:10.779
I always wanted a bike just like that.

05:11.053 --> 05:12.387
- Yeah.
- No!

05:17.881 --> 05:19.452
- Look at this kid!
- Get off of me, Jeff!

05:19.477 --> 05:21.206
You're breaking my arm!

05:24.418 --> 05:25.419
Get off!

05:30.424 --> 05:31.675
Oof!

05:36.222 --> 05:38.336
- You're dead.
- Holden, run.

05:38.361 --> 05:39.695
- Get him!
- Go!

05:42.014 --> 05:43.458
Don't let him go!

05:43.483 --> 05:45.271
Go, go! Get him!

05:48.234 --> 05:50.568
Come on, go, go, go,
go! Let's go, let's go!

05:50.569 --> 05:51.778
Hurry up! Hurry up and get in!

05:51.779 --> 05:53.238
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

06:00.913 --> 06:03.624
- Whoo!
- Come on, get him, get him!

06:09.713 --> 06:10.672
Aah!

06:10.673 --> 06:12.090
Speed up, speed up!

06:14.677 --> 06:16.125
Go! Get him, get him!

06:17.179 --> 06:18.431
Get him!

06:30.526 --> 06:32.198
Keep going! Dammit!

06:37.783 --> 06:38.784
Aah!

07:37.551 --> 07:39.020
Hey!

07:39.595 --> 07:41.180
Hey, who's there?

08:35.948 --> 08:40.089
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

09:26.660 --> 09:28.661
- Hello?
- Mrs. Matthews?

09:28.662 --> 09:29.787
Yes.

09:29.812 --> 09:32.091
I'm calling to tell you that your son...

09:32.791 --> 09:34.417
Mrs. Matthews, please!

09:34.418 --> 09:37.629
We still need to run
necessary tests, CT scans.

09:37.630 --> 09:40.256
Your son was unconscious for 12 years.

09:40.257 --> 09:41.549
You know the risks.

09:41.550 --> 09:43.593
There could be brain injury, amnesia.

09:43.594 --> 09:46.341
I need you to understand.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.451
We need to maintain
realistic expectations.

09:48.476 --> 09:49.945
And I want to see my son.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.304
Now.

10:24.686 --> 10:26.170
You're okay.

10:29.139 --> 10:31.225
You're okay.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.935
Mom, your... your hair.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.666
Well, yeah.

10:39.186 --> 10:40.608
Wh... where...

10:41.127 --> 10:42.544
where am I?

10:42.569 --> 10:44.005
He's disoriented.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.266
We gave him a sedative
to help the transition.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.835
Keep him talking. Let
him hear your voice.

10:49.913 --> 10:53.725
Holden, you're in a hospital, son.

10:53.917 --> 10:56.502
But you're okay. You're safe.

10:56.503 --> 10:59.922
You were asleep for... a long time.

10:59.923 --> 11:01.882
A really long time.

11:02.163 --> 11:05.788
But you're awake now and you're with us.

11:06.054 --> 11:07.221
How...

11:07.222 --> 11:09.508
how long was I asleep?

11:09.891 --> 11:12.644
What... what happened?

11:14.271 --> 11:16.147
Mom... Mom?

11:20.902 --> 11:22.611
N... no.

11:22.612 --> 11:24.363
No. Come on.

11:24.364 --> 11:26.032
- No. Holden...
- Holden.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.908
- Where are we?
- No, Holden.

11:29.161 --> 11:31.037
Holden...

11:37.586 --> 11:39.545
What happened to me?

11:39.546 --> 11:41.297
It was just a panic attack.

11:41.298 --> 11:43.424
- A mild one.
- But he's okay?

11:43.594 --> 11:46.719
As you know, there's been no
sign of muscle deterioration.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.430
No atrophy.

11:48.455 --> 11:49.972
He shouldn't even be speaking,

11:49.973 --> 11:51.849
let alone moving as well as he is.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.977
Which is why I'm recommending
he be transferred to...

11:54.978 --> 11:56.562
Transferred?

11:56.563 --> 11:59.647
I don't understand. He's
talking, he's responsive,

11:59.648 --> 12:01.452
you said that he was healthy.

12:01.477 --> 12:02.902
Diane...

12:02.903 --> 12:05.030
He's coming home with me.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.694
I'm grateful, Doctor,

12:07.719 --> 12:09.930
for everything that you've done.

12:11.953 --> 12:14.039
But my son is coming home.

12:16.487 --> 12:18.772
To call Holden's awakening a phenomenon

12:18.797 --> 12:20.715
would be an understatement.

12:22.881 --> 12:26.549
His condition is nothing
short of a miracle.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.791
Not only does he have considerable
use of his arms and legs,

12:29.816 --> 12:33.599
his mind appears to be fully responsive.

12:36.616 --> 12:38.742
Holden's body is operating
at a level that would be

12:38.767 --> 12:41.602
impressive regardless
of the circumstances.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.046
But it's still early.

12:45.451 --> 12:46.717
Over the next few weeks,

12:46.742 --> 12:49.576
we'll need to run
extensive diagnostic tests,

12:49.601 --> 12:54.162
CT scans, and an MRI to
monitor any lingering effects.

12:55.580 --> 12:58.750
There could still be
unforeseen complications.

13:00.502 --> 13:01.834
At this point,

13:01.859 --> 13:04.277
it's critical that
we begin to understand

13:04.302 --> 13:07.901
what happened to Holden and why.

13:08.969 --> 13:10.845
My God, what is this?

13:10.846 --> 13:12.138
Oh, my God, Tom.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.474
Go on, get out of the way.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.726
Where'd these people come from?

13:17.727 --> 13:19.427
- How'd they find out?
- Here he comes.

13:19.452 --> 13:21.578
- We'll try to get a comment from him.
- What? No! No!

13:21.603 --> 13:23.354
Can you tell us what you
expect in the next 24 hours?

13:23.379 --> 13:25.547
Leave us alone!

13:25.819 --> 13:28.195
A couple of comments!
Just a few comments please!

13:28.196 --> 13:30.489
- Hey! Hey! Stop it!
- No!

13:30.490 --> 13:33.311
For 12 years, Holden Matthews
has laid at County Hospital

13:33.336 --> 13:36.169
in one of the longest
recorded comas in history.

13:36.631 --> 13:38.924
But today, that streak
has come to an end.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.301
Holden was discovered awake in his bed

13:41.326 --> 13:44.068
at 7:15 in the morning by
one of the on-duty nurses.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.449
Now, we are being told
he's in stable condition.

13:46.474 --> 13:49.652
There is no word on whether or not
he'll be released in the coming weeks,

13:49.653 --> 13:51.746
but stay tuned for additional updates,

13:51.771 --> 13:53.689
- as the story continues to unfold.
- Kevin!

13:53.690 --> 13:54.849
Kevin!

13:55.312 --> 13:56.311
Whew!

14:25.547 --> 14:27.090
Holden?

14:29.476 --> 14:31.352
I came as soon as I heard.

14:32.896 --> 14:35.068
Luke. You...

14:35.639 --> 14:37.900
- you look...
- Different?

14:37.901 --> 14:39.526
Yeah, yeah.

14:39.527 --> 14:41.928
Puberty's a bitch.

14:42.079 --> 14:44.523
Well, obviously.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.620
Welcome home.

14:55.710 --> 14:57.839
- How old...
- I'm 17.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.349
Whoa.

15:00.143 --> 15:02.174
I already said it.
They're not girlfriends.

15:02.175 --> 15:04.104
They're just friends that are girls.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.518
- What's the difference?
- I'm not...

15:05.543 --> 15:06.925
- I'm not dating all of them.
- I made all your favorites.

15:06.950 --> 15:08.307
Thanks, Mom.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.101
We thank you, Heavenly Father,

15:13.102 --> 15:15.646
for the food we are about to receive.

15:15.647 --> 15:17.439
We thank you for giving us the strength

15:17.440 --> 15:19.858
during this difficult test.

15:19.859 --> 15:22.698
We thank you for returning Holden to us

15:22.723 --> 15:25.266
and for your compassion and your mercy

15:25.291 --> 15:27.417
in bringing our family back together.

15:27.659 --> 15:28.700
Amen.

15:28.701 --> 15:30.495
Amen.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.135
You like it?

15:34.885 --> 15:36.750
Very good. Thank you.

15:36.987 --> 15:38.877
Mm! If you want,

15:38.878 --> 15:40.963
you can make a list of
anything that you want

15:40.964 --> 15:42.297
in the house to eat or drink

15:42.298 --> 15:44.591
and I will go out first thing tomorrow.

15:44.592 --> 15:46.534
I could use some things.

15:46.886 --> 15:48.136
Since you mentioned it.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.847
Doesn't your school have a meal plan?

15:49.848 --> 15:51.723
Paying a lot of money for something.

15:51.964 --> 15:54.226
It's beer and weed mostly.

15:54.227 --> 15:56.052
Well, that's fine.

15:56.349 --> 15:58.340
Don't listen to your brother, Holden.

15:58.365 --> 16:00.107
College has corrupted him.

16:00.108 --> 16:01.525
College.

16:02.735 --> 16:04.435
Let the voicemail get it.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.863
It hasn't stopped.

16:05.888 --> 16:08.574
We've gotten calls from Diane Sawyer

16:08.575 --> 16:12.119
and Wendy Williams, hell, even Oprah.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.620
Oprah called for me.

16:13.621 --> 16:16.206
Well, not her personally.
Her people called.

16:16.231 --> 16:18.518
They want to sit down with you and talk.

16:18.543 --> 16:19.918
On TV.

16:19.919 --> 16:22.675
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do, all right?

16:24.255 --> 16:25.883
Sit down. Let the voicemail get it.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.926
I'm not letting Oprah go to voicemail.

16:27.927 --> 16:29.440
Take it somewhere else.
Tell 'em we're eating.

16:29.465 --> 16:31.221
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:31.222 --> 16:32.557
Y'ello?

16:39.272 --> 16:42.733
Um, you wouldn't believe the
change in the neighborhood.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.443
You remember where you
used to play little league?

16:44.444 --> 16:45.777
It's a shopping mall now.

16:45.778 --> 16:47.779
Yeah, complete with a movie theater

16:47.780 --> 16:50.657
and a Home Plus, even an Apple store.

16:50.658 --> 16:52.200
There's a whole store that sells apples?

16:52.201 --> 16:55.996
Apple computers, iPads,
MacBooks, Steve Jobs...

16:55.997 --> 16:57.206
Tom.

17:01.917 --> 17:05.339
Don't burden yourself trying
to play catch up all at once.

17:05.339 --> 17:06.381
All right?

17:06.382 --> 17:08.634
You've got plenty of time.

17:08.635 --> 17:09.843
Take it slow.

17:09.844 --> 17:11.377
'Kay?

17:12.020 --> 17:13.563
Okay.

17:28.655 --> 17:31.699
Now, Holden.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.442
See you soon.

17:50.218 --> 17:51.594
What the hell?

18:31.323 --> 18:33.399
- Oh, my God!
- He's here.

18:33.424 --> 18:35.012
- He just walked through the door.
- Holden, where have you been?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.252
Thank you, Sheriff. I appreciate it.

18:37.807 --> 18:39.266
Don't do that!

18:39.267 --> 18:40.767
Are you all right?

18:40.768 --> 18:41.768
I'm fine.

18:41.769 --> 18:43.562
What happened?

18:43.563 --> 18:45.147
Needed some air.

18:45.148 --> 18:46.691
I'm okay.

18:48.867 --> 18:51.494
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Of course you did.

19:30.716 --> 19:31.800
I need Security.

19:32.695 --> 19:34.196
Here.

19:34.197 --> 19:36.198
This should do the trick.

19:36.199 --> 19:37.616
Oh, man.

19:37.617 --> 19:40.369
It's old, but it'll get you online.

19:40.803 --> 19:43.163
There's this website,
it's called Wikipedia.

19:43.164 --> 19:44.831
It's like an online database

19:44.832 --> 19:46.663
for, you know, just about everything,

19:46.688 --> 19:50.366
so if you have any questions
about like the past 12 years...

19:54.509 --> 19:56.635
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

19:56.636 --> 19:57.886
Of course.

19:57.887 --> 19:59.888
'Cause you can tell me...

19:59.889 --> 20:01.765
if you're not okay.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.016
Okay.

20:03.483 --> 20:04.893
I'd be out of my mind.

20:04.894 --> 20:08.108
Like, pissing down my left
leg terrified if I had to...

20:08.133 --> 20:09.491
Not that you should be terrified.

20:09.516 --> 20:10.752
I'm fine.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.866
This morning, I...

20:13.361 --> 20:15.947
I don't know, I just needed some air.

20:19.242 --> 20:21.743
Swear by the Holy Sacred
Covenant of Brotherhood?

20:23.329 --> 20:26.498
I swear by the Holy Sacred
Covenant of Brotherhood.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.209
Mm. Come on.

20:29.210 --> 20:31.107
Mom gave me some money
for some new clothes.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.106
- You up for a drive?
- Yeah.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.342
What is it?

20:37.608 --> 20:39.761
I've never driven a car before.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.686
Dad taught me this.

20:45.393 --> 20:47.397
It's an automatic.
There's like nothing to it.

20:47.685 --> 20:48.741
Okay.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.420
So roll it over.

20:51.816 --> 20:52.858
Yeah.

20:52.859 --> 20:54.163
All right, put it in gear.

20:54.334 --> 20:55.861
- This guy, right? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.547
- Okay, uh, park.
- Yeah.

20:57.572 --> 20:59.072
- R. R, cool.
- There you go.

20:59.073 --> 21:01.032
And now ease on the gas. Ease.

21:01.033 --> 21:03.319
Oh! Brakes, brakes, brakes!

21:14.130 --> 21:15.297
Switch?

21:15.469 --> 21:16.928
Switch.

21:17.884 --> 21:19.334
What about Janitorial?

21:19.359 --> 21:21.428
The night shift, maybe
someone had a key.

21:21.429 --> 21:23.429
They know me. They wouldn't.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.307
Well, I'd bet my badge whoever did this

21:25.308 --> 21:27.382
was after something specific.

21:28.323 --> 21:30.116
You care to speculate?

21:34.962 --> 21:36.839
If I had to speculate...

21:47.219 --> 21:49.915
I think I look like Dad.

21:49.916 --> 21:53.084
- Or someone's dad, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

21:53.085 --> 21:55.320
- It's very dad-core. I love it.
- I...

21:57.381 --> 21:58.913
She seems to like it.

21:58.938 --> 22:01.760
No, don't... look right at her.

22:02.229 --> 22:03.981
Who needs subtlety, right?

22:05.181 --> 22:06.890
What do I do?

22:06.891 --> 22:08.850
You go and talk to her.

22:09.164 --> 22:11.686
Maybe she wants an autograph, you know?

22:12.155 --> 22:13.656
Maybe something a little more.

22:13.681 --> 22:15.016
Yeah.

22:17.193 --> 22:19.611
Look, there's nothing
to be afraid of. Just...

22:19.612 --> 22:21.780
- I'm not afraid.
- I know. I...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.490
I know.

22:23.491 --> 22:25.283
Just, um...

22:25.284 --> 22:28.745
just go over there and...
and ask her name, you know?

22:28.746 --> 22:32.352
And compliment her,
okay? That is like, key.

22:32.547 --> 22:34.042
Doesn't really matter what.

22:34.043 --> 22:35.919
You just kinda gotta...

22:35.920 --> 22:37.879
pick something and
tell her it looks good.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.256
All right?

22:39.257 --> 22:41.008
- Yeah, okay.
- Go, go.

22:43.031 --> 22:44.905
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, sorry.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.680
You can't... you can't wear that.

22:47.313 --> 22:49.148
- This okay?
- Yeah.

22:55.076 --> 22:56.159
Hi.

22:56.184 --> 22:57.394
Hey.

22:59.191 --> 23:00.777
- I'm...
- Holden.

23:00.778 --> 23:02.394
I know.

23:02.434 --> 23:04.511
Oh. Okay.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.681
Um...

23:13.434 --> 23:15.602
That would look good on you.

23:17.295 --> 23:18.671
Excuse me?

23:20.548 --> 23:22.799
Oh, no, I, um, I don't mean...

23:22.800 --> 23:24.634
It's the, uh, um, it's a nice color.

23:24.635 --> 23:27.461
The color, it's nice. It's like blood.

23:29.724 --> 23:30.807
I'm so, uh...

23:30.808 --> 23:32.351
Look, I'm sorry, I...

23:33.436 --> 23:34.686
Not sure how this normally goes,

23:34.687 --> 23:37.726
but probably a lot
better than this, but I...

23:38.443 --> 23:39.792
Uh, forget it.

23:39.817 --> 23:41.652
I was never here. Sorry.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.007
I'll see you soon.

24:14.442 --> 24:16.903
_

24:56.660 --> 24:58.078
Do it.

24:58.688 --> 24:59.855
Do it.

25:00.247 --> 25:01.582
Do it, Holden.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.211
No more holding back.

25:04.501 --> 25:06.210
Don't be afraid.

25:06.211 --> 25:08.261
They're coming for you.

25:10.284 --> 25:13.488
Do it, Holden. Do it now.

25:18.474 --> 25:20.225
Ah, great.

25:42.518 --> 25:46.182
So I'll see you next Wednesday.

25:54.941 --> 25:57.277
Yeah, come on in.

26:09.049 --> 26:11.384
Nice office, Falcon.

26:23.178 --> 26:24.930
I'm so sorry, Holden.

26:33.861 --> 26:36.241
- You're married?
- That's Christine.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.227
We're expecting our
first kid any day now.

26:40.034 --> 26:41.719
Christine.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.912
So, you're, um...

26:43.913 --> 26:46.039
some kind of psychiatrist?

26:46.040 --> 26:47.413
No, um,

26:47.438 --> 26:50.586
school counselor/teacher.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.487
I'm still working on my doctorate,

26:52.488 --> 26:55.824
but they let me see
students during office hours.

26:57.034 --> 26:58.446
Listen, Holden, uh,

26:58.471 --> 27:01.079
Dr. Warren said it might help
for you to talk to someone.

27:01.477 --> 27:04.624
Look, I'm here as your
friend first and foremost.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.126
How are you holding up?

27:07.410 --> 27:10.329
Wish everyone would stop asking me that.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.591
You know, um, there's this psychiatrist,

27:13.592 --> 27:15.048
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,

27:15.073 --> 27:17.342
and she wrote a book outlining
the five stages of grief,

27:17.367 --> 27:18.909
the first being denial.

27:18.934 --> 27:20.185
She says most of the time,

27:20.210 --> 27:22.336
people ignore or try to rationalize

27:22.361 --> 27:24.695
- what they're going through...
- Kev.

27:24.853 --> 27:28.001
Thought you said you were
my friend first and foremost.

27:28.026 --> 27:29.626
- I... I am.
- My friend never...

27:29.651 --> 27:32.610
read anything that didn't
have a centerfold, so...

27:33.862 --> 27:35.364
Talk to me, Holden.

27:37.199 --> 27:38.867
You know you can trust me.

27:44.529 --> 27:45.946
I know.

27:50.939 --> 27:53.555
Dr. Warren requested a few
more photos for her album.

27:53.580 --> 27:54.956
Wait, um...

27:55.259 --> 27:57.009
will this hurt?

27:57.010 --> 27:58.261
You'll be fine.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.763
Try not to move or
we'll have to restart.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.530
Look alive, ladies. Here we go.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.365
Initiating scan...

28:19.366 --> 28:20.742
Images coming online.

28:22.679 --> 28:24.681
System reading normally.
Everything's great.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.068
Looking good. Nice slices.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.264
What?

28:43.265 --> 28:44.265
What's going on?

28:46.185 --> 28:47.650
It must be some kind of interference.

28:47.675 --> 28:49.158
Attempting signal suppression.

28:49.183 --> 28:51.184
No more holding back.

28:51.209 --> 28:52.604
Do it now.

29:01.554 --> 29:03.409
What the hell was that?

29:03.410 --> 29:05.101
Shut down. Let's restart.

29:05.126 --> 29:06.210
Okay.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.445
Aah! It's hot.

29:14.347 --> 29:17.309
Grab the extinguisher!
Go, go, go, go, go!

29:33.802 --> 29:36.951
Do we have to do it again?

29:47.027 --> 29:48.871
_

29:51.309 --> 29:53.215
_

29:55.461 --> 29:56.867
_

29:56.892 --> 29:58.156
_

30:00.687 --> 30:03.140
_

30:09.165 --> 30:10.559
- Kevin?
- _

30:12.460 --> 30:14.616
Everything okay?

30:15.065 --> 30:17.109
I'm on the phone.

30:21.571 --> 30:22.952
This is Kevin.

30:22.977 --> 30:24.407
Where are you with Holden?

30:24.408 --> 30:26.284
I... I was in class all day. I...

30:26.285 --> 30:28.452
- What does he know?
- Nothing.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.538
And he... he's confused. He's scared.

30:30.539 --> 30:32.415
You know, I... I really don't think

30:32.416 --> 30:33.833
he's the guy that you're looking for.

30:33.834 --> 30:34.960
But if you give me some more time, I...

30:34.985 --> 30:36.616
- Time's up.
- Wait, no, look,

30:36.641 --> 30:37.878
I'll get you what you want.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.944
Hello?

30:42.217 --> 30:43.553
Hello?

30:57.816 --> 30:58.909
I'm here.

30:58.934 --> 31:00.318
Change of plans.

31:00.319 --> 31:03.034
The shrink can no longer be trusted.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.282
Oh, you don't say?

31:06.283 --> 31:07.925
Do what you have to do.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.425
I want to be certain he's the one.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.829
Copy that.

31:16.835 --> 31:18.253
Hola.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.505
Hey.

32:02.872 --> 32:04.036
Hey.

32:04.061 --> 32:06.122
First time in a bar,
they didn't even card me.

32:06.147 --> 32:07.510
Yeah, well...

32:07.511 --> 32:09.145
Two beers, Gus.

32:09.170 --> 32:10.429
They know who you are.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.224
Everyone knows who you are.

32:13.350 --> 32:16.269
That's... comforting.

32:19.064 --> 32:21.200
Listen, Kev, about the other day...

32:22.317 --> 32:24.856
you've always been there for me.

32:25.112 --> 32:26.825
You always had my back.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.544
Right?

32:30.966 --> 32:33.303
Kevin? What... what is it?

32:33.328 --> 32:34.943
I screwed up.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.412
Listen, I don't know
how much time we have,

32:37.437 --> 32:38.600
or what they plan to do.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.418
- "They"?
- You're in a lot of trouble.

32:40.419 --> 32:41.752
What are you talking about?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.757
Kevin, what the hell is going on?

32:46.758 --> 32:49.419
- Look, I brought you here to warn you.
- Warn me? About what?

32:49.511 --> 32:51.262
Dude, if this is some kind of joke...

32:51.263 --> 32:53.333
Dammit, Holden! I'm not making this up.

32:53.358 --> 32:55.310
They're going to be coming
for you. I don't know when,

32:55.335 --> 32:56.575
I just know that they are real...

32:56.600 --> 32:57.892
Who's coming for me?

32:58.270 --> 33:00.052
Is it the... the girl?

33:00.077 --> 33:01.177
The girl with the black hair,

33:01.202 --> 33:02.427
- did she get to you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

33:02.452 --> 33:04.279
Girl? What... what girl?

33:04.359 --> 33:05.505
Holden, did someone threaten you?

33:05.530 --> 33:06.535
No, she didn't threaten me.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.654
She... tried to...

33:08.967 --> 33:10.388
to warn me.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.679
Hey.

33:15.704 --> 33:16.912
Hey.

33:16.937 --> 33:19.189
Holden, Holden, Track
your breath. Come on.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.381
Breathe, buddy. Breathe.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.585
- I...
- Breathe. Breathe.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.105
I gotta go. I'm gonna be sick.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.006
Dammit!

33:30.974 --> 33:33.100
Hey, look, it'll be okay.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.329
We're gonna figure something out.

33:34.354 --> 33:35.479
Don't worry about it. Just...

33:35.515 --> 33:37.142
Kev?

33:40.228 --> 33:41.688
Hey!

33:45.665 --> 33:46.666
Kev!

33:50.339 --> 33:51.674
Let go of me!

33:52.600 --> 33:53.766
No!

33:58.014 --> 33:59.598
I know who you are.

34:00.052 --> 34:02.554
More importantly, I
know what you can do.

34:04.455 --> 34:05.915
Show me.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.261
Please, wait.

34:14.262 --> 34:17.054
- Come on, you can do it.
- What are you talking about?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.782
I don't know what you're talking about!

34:18.806 --> 34:21.478
- I...
- Then I'd say we have a problem.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.563
Here's what's gonna happen...

34:26.775 --> 34:28.859
he's gonna pull the trigger,

34:29.250 --> 34:32.710
you're gonna stop that bullet
from entering your friend's brain.

34:32.882 --> 34:35.092
- No, no, no!
- On the count of three.

34:35.117 --> 34:36.574
- No, please, no!
- One.

34:36.576 --> 34:38.661
I'm not who you think I am!

34:38.661 --> 34:40.956
- Two.
- Don't!

35:47.564 --> 35:49.554
Holden, get in the car!

35:50.070 --> 35:51.311
Now!

36:08.501 --> 36:10.211
You hit?

36:11.309 --> 36:12.887
Holden! Are you hit?

36:12.912 --> 36:15.317
No, no, I... No, I don't think so.

36:17.051 --> 36:19.551
Kevin! No, we have to go back for Kevin.

36:19.576 --> 36:22.145
Your friend is fine.
They're not after him.

36:22.641 --> 36:25.327
I thought... I thought
they were gonna kill him.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.684
They were gonna shoot him
unless I did something.

36:27.716 --> 36:29.133
They needed validation.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.479
Proof that you have
what they're looking for.

36:31.504 --> 36:33.059
I don't.

36:35.489 --> 36:37.823
I don't! What, do you...

36:38.106 --> 36:41.473
what, do you... you think
I can... I can stop a bullet?

36:41.789 --> 36:43.666
I know you can.

36:45.075 --> 36:48.643
Did you all escape from
the same mental hospital?

36:48.815 --> 36:51.332
I can't even drive a car! I'm...

36:53.762 --> 36:55.091
Who are you?

36:55.092 --> 36:56.817
Holden...

36:57.264 --> 36:58.848
it's me...

36:59.468 --> 37:00.820
Willa.

37:02.849 --> 37:05.726
Is... is that supposed
to mean something to me?

37:05.727 --> 37:07.130
I...

37:07.896 --> 37:10.575
I've never seen you before in my life.

37:14.444 --> 37:16.570
Where are you taking me?

37:16.571 --> 37:18.059
Somewhere safe.

37:21.885 --> 37:23.177
No, look, I...

37:23.537 --> 37:25.674
I just need to go home, please.

37:25.699 --> 37:27.838
- Please, take me home.
- Can't take you home.

37:28.233 --> 37:30.319
That's the first place
they'll look for you.

37:31.096 --> 37:32.837
What... what about my family?

37:32.838 --> 37:34.255
Luke, my mom, my dad!

37:34.256 --> 37:35.798
- I...
- Safer without you.

37:35.799 --> 37:37.925
No, I need to get to
them! I need to warn them!

37:37.926 --> 37:39.713
Please, stop the car!

37:40.303 --> 37:42.221
Stop the car!

37:44.641 --> 37:46.101
Stop the car!

37:47.098 --> 37:48.683
I said stop the car!

38:15.630 --> 38:17.590
Whoa! What the hell was that?

38:17.591 --> 38:19.049
Whoa.

38:19.050 --> 38:21.135
What did you do?

38:21.136 --> 38:23.220
I didn't do anything, Holden.

38:23.221 --> 38:24.848
You did.

38:25.849 --> 38:28.601
You really don't remember, do you?

38:28.602 --> 38:30.106
Remember what?

38:30.131 --> 38:32.646
The past 12 years.

38:32.671 --> 38:35.459
Your body was dormant,

38:35.484 --> 38:37.545
all those years lying
in that hospital bed.

38:37.570 --> 38:39.987
But your consciousness wasn't.

38:39.988 --> 38:43.532
You lived a life those
past 12 years, Holden.

38:43.928 --> 38:46.327
I watched you grow up.

38:46.328 --> 38:49.209
I watched you learn to
do the things you can do.

38:49.529 --> 38:52.750
This, this is nothing.

38:52.751 --> 38:55.092
Just a scratch on the surface.

38:55.337 --> 38:58.547
But beneath that surface
is something dangerous

38:58.548 --> 39:00.607
if you don't learn to control it.

39:00.632 --> 39:02.133
This is insane.

39:02.761 --> 39:05.137
- You're insane!
- It's the truth!

39:05.607 --> 39:07.275
Come with me.

39:07.933 --> 39:09.381
Come with me and I'll help you.

39:09.406 --> 39:11.990
No! I don't need your help!

39:12.015 --> 39:13.506
I don't want your help!

39:13.531 --> 39:15.156
I don't want any of this!

39:15.398 --> 39:17.566
I want my old life back!

39:17.873 --> 39:20.945
I can't give you your
old life back, Holden.

39:20.946 --> 39:22.396
No one can.

39:24.540 --> 39:27.168
But I can show you the
life you always wanted.

39:27.947 --> 39:29.920
How would you know that?

39:30.997 --> 39:32.706
Because...

39:32.707 --> 39:34.209
you told me.

39:38.372 --> 39:39.957
Stay away from me.

39:41.278 --> 39:43.417
If I see you again,
I'm calling the cops.

39:44.321 --> 39:46.490
Holden, please!

40:44.904 --> 40:46.212
Hey.

40:46.567 --> 40:48.322
Sorry I'm late.

40:50.205 --> 40:51.952
They got to him first.

40:51.953 --> 40:53.626
I had to intervene.

40:54.378 --> 40:55.978
He doesn't remember.

40:56.896 --> 40:58.917
He's not ready.

41:02.155 --> 41:04.382
_

41:08.720 --> 41:10.262
They got to him once.

41:10.287 --> 41:12.318
They can get him again.

41:13.294 --> 41:14.892
It's only a matter of time.

41:17.294 --> 41:19.122
_

41:24.748 --> 41:26.558
And if we're too late?

41:26.949 --> 41:28.722
