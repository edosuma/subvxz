00:37.245 --> 00:39.581
all: USA! USA!

00:39.622 --> 00:40.623
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>But the thing about fame</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:42.584

Hard!

<i>with just a slim margin</i>
<i>of hope,</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:30.632
<i>may I remind you of</i>
<i>that ancient curling truism</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:33.927
<i>that's been around since</i>
<i>water first froze into ice</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:36.971
<i>and certainly before</i>
<i>the idea of fame</i>

01:37.013 --> 01:39.474

<i>that John Shuster</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.748
<i>to keep their Olympic hopes</i>
<i>alive.</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:07.961
<i>But if it sounds harrowing,</i>
<i>it's not unfamiliar</i>

02:08.003 --> 02:09.713
<i>considering four years ago,</i>

02:09.754 --> 02:13.883
<i>the team was in</i>
<i>exactly the same predicament.</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:16.344


02:16.386 --> 02:17.679


02:17.721 --> 02:19.931
- Heavy control!
- Yep, yep, yep!

02:19.973 --> 02:22.017


02:22.058 --> 02:23.351
- Do it!

02:23.393 --> 02:25.228
- Come on!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.731
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>And at the 2017 trials,</i>

<i>best-of-three finals,</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:34.320
<i>they rallied back</i>
<i>and won two straight</i>

02:34.362 --> 02:36.656
<i>to complete</i>
<i>a seismic turnaround</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:39.951
<i>that propelled them</i>
<i>to South Korea.</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:42.495

<i>John Shuster and his team</i>

02:42.537 --> 02:45.415

02:49.169 --> 02:50.795

for it.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.589
Let's do this, baby.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.050
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>So just order another comeback</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:57.802
<i>from the story menu, right?</i>

02:57.844 --> 03:00.263
<i>If only real life were</i>
<i>so simple.</i>

03:00.305 --> 03:03.475
<i>Which means the sense</i>
<i>of déjà vu for Team Shuster</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:05.685
<i>isn't so comforting,</i>

03:05.727 --> 03:11.191
<i>particularly with Team</i>
<i>Dropkin's confidence sky-high.</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:13.443
<i>- The most frustrating part</i>
<i>I think for us</i>

03:13.485 --> 03:15.570
<i>was that we gave them a strut.</i>

03:15.612 --> 03:17.655
They had all the momentum

03:17.697 --> 03:19.449
and for me, it just, you know,

03:19.491 --> 03:21.368
and our team,
I think it added fuel

03:21.409 --> 03:25.413
to try to get that strut out
of their system.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.999
All right, boys.
Let's have some fun.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.126
<i>We came out</i>
<i>with a different attitude,</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.212
backs against the wall
and we have nothing to lose,

03:32.253 --> 03:36.341
and that's when
we play our best.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.177
- Atta boy, Landsteiner!
Good start!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.638
<i>NARRATOR: Embracing the</i>
<i>pressure is the best way</i>

03:41.680 --> 03:44.891
<i>to handle</i>
<i>the greatest pressure,</i>

03:44.933 --> 03:46.810
<i>particularly when</i>
<i>the opponent</i>

03:46.851 --> 03:50.355
<i>shows no sign</i>
<i>of capitulating themselves.</i>

03:50.397 --> 03:53.274

<i>and company looking for two.</i>

03:53.316 --> 03:55.318
<i>They've got it.</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:57.404
Atta boy.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.280


03:59.322 --> 04:01.282
<i>commentator: They are</i>
<i>chasing Korey Dropkin</i>

04:01.324 --> 04:05.286
<i>on the scoreboard</i>
<i>for a second straight night.</i>

04:05.328 --> 04:07.080
Great start, great start.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.748
<i>- That's our goal</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:10.000
<i>is to just not let, like,</i>

04:10.041 --> 04:12.669
<i>misses compound</i>
<i>through the lineup.</i>

04:12.711 --> 04:14.796
And, you know, I told them in
the locker room to everybody.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.048
It was like if Steiner
misses one, Matty, get him.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.550
And if you miss him,
then I got him.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.176
<i>And if I miss it,</i>
<i>Shusty's got us.</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:23.054
<i>And I thought we did</i>
<i>a great job of that.</i>

04:23.096 --> 04:27.642
<i>NARRATOR: Chris Plys may be</i>
<i>the team's lone newcomer...</i>

04:27.684 --> 04:32.063
-
- Let's go! Good job.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.815
<i>NARRATOR: But he came</i>
<i>to the biggest game</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:36.609
<i>of his curling life</i>
<i>with the right approach...</i>

04:36.651 --> 04:38.653
- All right, Steiner!
- Hard! Right to it!

04:38.695 --> 04:41.031

Catch it.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.828
<i>commentator: What a shot!</i>

04:46.870 --> 04:49.664
- That's my boy!
Nice shot, baby!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.750
<i>commentator: They needed</i>
<i>their skipper to deliver,</i>

04:51.791 --> 04:54.461
<i>and boy, did he ever!</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:56.755
- Make Korey throw
one precision shot.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.298
I think the goal at the end

04:58.340 --> 04:59.174
is to make him throw one
precise shot

04:59.215 --> 05:00.675
Yeah.

05:00.717 --> 05:01.968
- He's thrown nothing
but open hits and open draws

05:02.010 --> 05:03.970
- the whole frickin' game.
- Yeah.

05:04.012 --> 05:08.016
<i>commentator: Down one here</i>
<i>in a must-win game.</i>

05:08.058 --> 05:09.684
<i>- Our keys to success</i>
<i>to beating them</i>

05:09.726 --> 05:12.520
is gonna be to
make Korey throw critical shots

05:12.562 --> 05:13.897
where the worst shot
on the sheet

05:13.938 --> 05:16.066
was right next
to the best shot on the sheet.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.777
<i>NARRATOR: "The best-laid</i>
<i>schemes of mice and men,"</i>

05:18.818 --> 05:20.820
<i>as the famous phrase goes.</i>

05:20.862 --> 05:23.740
<i>But halfway through the game,</i>

<i>Team Shuster's plan to force</i>
<i>Dropkin into tough shots</i>

<i>Dropkin gets a shot</i>
<i>to score five,</i>

05:34.918 --> 05:38.046

05:42.509 --> 05:44.427

- Curl!

05:58.858 --> 06:01.528
Hard curl!
Hard curl!

06:01.569 --> 06:03.947
Curl, curl, curl, curl, curl!

<i>commentator:</i>
<i>Couldn't get it done.</i>

06:06.491 --> 06:10.078
<i>And Team Shuster</i>
<i>gets a steal of two</i>

06:10.120 --> 06:12.247

<i>of this game.</i>

06:12.288 --> 06:13.957
Perfect spot.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.834
- Atta boy. Good job, dude.
- Let's finish this thing out.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.210
- Let's go.
- I think we'll get 'em.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.211
- Yeah.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.088
Blood in the water, baby.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.172
There's two types of people
in this world.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.841
There's sharks and sheep.
What are we?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.092
- We're sharks, baby.
- Sharks!

06:25.260 --> 06:26.428
- Finally made 'em
throw a precise one.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.721
Exactly what we said.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.389
- There's blood in the water.
Let's be sharks.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.765
Sharks eat sheep.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.599
- We're still throwing
for three here.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.771
<i>That shot that Korey had</i>

06:36.813 --> 06:38.982
<i>to punch his ticket</i>
<i>to the Olympics,</i>

<i>he probably missed it</i>
<i>by like a half an inch.</i>

06:42.277 --> 06:45.238
And we felt like that momentum
shift was just what we needed

06:45.280 --> 06:46.948
to get a full head of steam

06:46.990 --> 06:49.576

<i>for a grand finale--</i>

08:05.485 --> 08:11.658
<i>one game, winner-take-all,</i>
<i>for a berth in the Olympics.</i>

08:11.700 --> 08:15.161

<i>We didn't by the way,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

08:17.747 --> 08:20.375
<i>But sports can be pretty wild,</i>
<i>right?</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:30.010

<i>drywall the day he gets home.</i>

08:30.051 --> 08:32.012
No, I'm just--

08:32.053 --> 08:33.763
He already told me. He's like,
"I'm gonna need to sleep

08:33.805 --> 08:36.391
for probably three days
after this."

08:36.433 --> 08:39.769

<i>Big win last night,</i>

08:44.816 --> 08:46.067

better sleep last night

08:46.109 --> 08:48.236

08:48.278 --> 08:49.612

<i>whose many sacrifices to reach</i>

09:05.879 --> 09:07.630

- Mm-hmm.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.743
We are being very, very patient

any unnecessary opportunities.

<i>one mini-break.</i>

16:02.796 --> 16:03.838
Hard, hard!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.256
<i>NARRATOR:</i>

<i>how the final phase</i>
<i>of a competition</i>

<i>can come down</i>

<i>To wit, the first team here</i>
<i>to score two points</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:18.728

16:18.770 --> 16:20.563

the whole week

16:20.605 --> 16:22.941
was to really take advantage
of when the other team misses,
