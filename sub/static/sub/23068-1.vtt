03:00.302 --> 03:02.129
Could you buy a girl a drink?

03:02.154 --> 03:05.717
Sweetheart, I can't even afford my own.

03:06.599 --> 03:09.469
That's OK.
Maybe we can skip the drink.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.193
Not tonight.

03:22.526 --> 03:25.377
Hey. Hey.

03:26.142 --> 03:27.186
So who do I got to sleep with

03:27.188 --> 03:28.551
to get another drink around here?

03:28.576 --> 03:30.846
I think you've had enough, Sean.

03:30.871 --> 03:32.221
Oh, says who?

03:32.777 --> 03:34.347
Says me.

03:35.829 --> 03:38.198
Besides, I doubt that you
can even afford that drink,

03:38.200 --> 03:39.406
much less give me a tip.

03:39.431 --> 03:40.793
Oh, come on.
You know I'm good for it.

03:40.817 --> 03:42.381
Dad!

03:46.690 --> 03:50.074
See? This is why
we're not together anymore.

03:50.371 --> 03:52.635
We're not together anymore

03:52.660 --> 03:54.824
for a lot of reasons.

03:56.313 --> 03:58.452
And for your information,
you used to listen to me.

03:58.454 --> 04:00.930
And what do you want from me then, Sherry?

04:00.955 --> 04:02.489
What do you want, huh?

04:02.491 --> 04:04.824
You want me to go sit behind some desk somewhere?

04:05.347 --> 04:07.097
A 9-to-5?

04:09.897 --> 04:11.867
I just want you to go home.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.101
Brock, I need to talk to you about something.

04:16.103 --> 04:18.379
- Yo!
- What the hell?

04:19.992 --> 04:21.599
Was that necessary?

04:21.624 --> 04:22.638
It's fine.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.679
Oh, I'm sorry.
My hand must have slipped.

04:25.714 --> 04:27.655
Yeah. Accident.

04:28.365 --> 04:30.076
Now get me another drink.

04:31.911 --> 04:33.692
Fucking slut.

04:40.027 --> 04:41.664
Can I help you?

04:41.689 --> 04:43.530
I think you owe her an apology.

04:43.532 --> 04:45.493
No, bro.
I don't think I do.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.745
Dom, you hear this guy?

04:47.770 --> 04:50.169
Hey, what are you supposed
to be, some kind of pretty boy?

04:50.171 --> 04:52.028
Tell you what, pretty boy, you better turn around

04:52.052 --> 04:53.449
and go back to that bar and buy us

04:53.474 --> 04:55.847
another fucking round of drinks.

04:55.872 --> 04:59.149
And I won't make you tap out.

05:13.628 --> 05:14.994
That's right.
Pour me one.

05:14.996 --> 05:17.170
Hey, while you're at it, pour me one.

05:18.243 --> 05:20.179
What the fuck?

05:26.590 --> 05:28.027
Mother...

05:33.849 --> 05:35.248
Dad, what are you doing?

05:35.250 --> 05:36.346
Dad?

05:38.213 --> 05:39.752
I'm calling the cops.

05:40.112 --> 05:41.642
I'm impressed.

05:42.173 --> 05:43.525
I know.

05:44.246 --> 05:46.426
Yeah, Jake, it's Rocco.

05:46.451 --> 05:48.114
He's doing it again.

05:51.713 --> 05:53.641
They're going to lock him up this time.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.830
You want a shot at the title?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.159
Let's go.

06:12.186 --> 06:14.029
- Fucking lunatic.
- Stop!

06:14.950 --> 06:16.814
Son of a bitch!

06:16.839 --> 06:20.491
You are a stupid, selfish son of a bitch.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.333
I can't believe what you just did, Sean.

06:23.358 --> 06:26.099
You're going to pay for these fucking damages.

06:26.101 --> 06:29.621
Every fucking penny, you fucking loser.

06:30.926 --> 06:32.106
Fuck!

06:55.257 --> 06:56.631
This your comeback?

06:57.812 --> 06:58.832
What, champ?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.251
What was all that, then?

07:00.276 --> 07:01.970
They were fucking asking for it.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.654
It's funny how all these guys
are asking for it, huh?

07:05.678 --> 07:07.671
Seems to me somebody should
be looking in the mirror,

07:07.695 --> 07:09.240
taking a good look at themselves.

07:09.265 --> 07:11.062
Maybe they're the ones
who are looking for it, huh?

07:11.086 --> 07:13.194
- Trying to prove something.
- He called Sherry a slut.

07:13.218 --> 07:15.901
- So you beat him half to death?
- Yeah, fuck him.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.118
Wow. Really?

07:18.399 --> 07:19.756
Let me ask you something.

07:21.061 --> 07:23.022
You had that belt for, what was it, three years?

07:23.186 --> 07:25.392
And remind me, was it three
title defenses or four?

07:25.394 --> 07:27.997
- I always forget.
- What's your point, Jake?

07:28.022 --> 07:30.544
My point is that when these losers in the bar

07:30.569 --> 07:32.626
get out of the hospital and
get a lawyer and sue your ass,

07:32.650 --> 07:34.387
and that scumbag lawyer shows the judge

07:34.412 --> 07:37.339
the YouTube video of Sean 'The Killin' Dillon's'

07:37.364 --> 07:38.917
greatest MMA hits,

07:38.942 --> 07:40.863
how do you think
your self-defense plea

07:40.888 --> 07:42.653
is going to play out then?

07:42.933 --> 07:44.777
You know the answer, right?

07:47.382 --> 07:50.749
You want your son visiting you in prison?

07:51.952 --> 07:53.787
And that's why you use a condom

07:53.789 --> 07:56.256
when you bang the hot bartender
before you're old enough

07:56.258 --> 07:57.519
to buy drinks from her.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.959
- I have been a good father.
- Bullshit!

07:59.984 --> 08:01.227
You got a funny way of showing it.

08:01.229 --> 08:03.095
You shouldn't even be in a place like this,

08:03.097 --> 08:05.367
especially during the day!

08:07.865 --> 08:10.952
Hey, look, I told your father I'd look after you.

08:10.977 --> 08:12.172
And I'm going to.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.702
Good for you, man.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.941
What are you looking at, huh?

08:15.943 --> 08:17.542
What are you looking at?

08:18.409 --> 08:21.259
Get it together, Sean.
Get it together.

08:21.284 --> 08:22.932
That's all I ask.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.201
And you pay Rocco back his money.

08:26.226 --> 08:27.690
It's the least you can do.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.536
You're messing up, kid.

08:31.831 --> 08:33.573
You're messing up, Sean!

08:37.948 --> 08:39.760
You can't fight the whole world!

10:17.277 --> 10:19.165
- Why are you following me?
- Wait, wait, wait!

10:19.167 --> 10:20.532
- Why are you following me?
- OK, OK!

10:20.534 --> 10:21.935
- Answer me!
- OK.

10:21.937 --> 10:23.335
My name's Deke.

10:23.337 --> 10:25.910
- And?
- I got a proposition for you.

10:26.246 --> 10:27.323
What kind of proposition?

10:27.348 --> 10:28.941
The kind that can make you some money.

10:28.943 --> 10:30.431
- Lots of it.
- You...

10:30.456 --> 10:31.978
OK, OK, you guys are fighting, man.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.291
The boys at Blood Circus
are going to love that shit.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.963
- What are you talking about?
- You're Sean Dillon, right?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.478
Depends who's asking.

10:39.503 --> 10:42.055
Sean Dillon in the flesh, man.
I'm a huge fan.

10:42.057 --> 10:43.883
What do you want, a fucking autograph?

10:43.908 --> 10:45.711
I'm not here for your signature.

10:46.586 --> 10:48.918
- Then why are you following me?
- I represent the show.

10:48.943 --> 10:50.535
And the circus is in town, man.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.263
High stakes, big money.

10:52.288 --> 10:54.563
And an audience of millions.

10:54.774 --> 10:55.764
Yeah? What's big money?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.108
40 grand.

10:58.170 --> 11:00.218
Huh? I told you
I had something.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.574
The Blood Circus.

11:01.576 --> 11:03.530
Secret underground fighting tournament.

11:03.555 --> 11:06.857
MMA-style.
Right in your wheelhouse.

11:06.882 --> 11:08.956
And winners get fucking paid.

11:09.979 --> 11:12.006
- I'm through with that shit, man.
- No, no, no, trust me.

11:12.030 --> 11:14.216
The audience is online.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.922
Invitation only.

11:16.168 --> 11:17.322
Every fighter is handpicked

11:17.324 --> 11:18.624
and the bets are processed offshore.

11:18.626 --> 11:21.460
No one knows anything.
You're a ghost.

11:22.356 --> 11:23.768
There are three fights.

11:23.793 --> 11:25.531
Five grand for the first round,
10 for the second.

11:25.533 --> 11:28.422
That's 15 grand to fuck up a couple of amateurs.

11:28.447 --> 11:30.970
And from what I saw back at the bar,

11:30.972 --> 11:32.504
you do that on the reg.

11:32.506 --> 11:35.070
You make it to the finals and you win,

11:35.422 --> 11:37.313
you get another 25 large.

11:39.572 --> 11:41.180
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

11:41.182 --> 11:42.451
You need cash, right?

11:44.119 --> 11:46.418
Listen, you want to get out of your predicament,

11:46.420 --> 11:49.455
make some money instead of being
lectured by some busted-ass cop.

11:49.457 --> 11:51.192
Let me help you.

11:51.557 --> 11:53.150
Just think about it.

11:53.611 --> 11:56.028
Meet me at Rocco's
day after tomorrow, 6:00 p.m.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.538
If it looks good, just don't be late.

11:58.563 --> 12:00.501
It's a quick ride to the house.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.871
What happens if I lose?

12:03.896 --> 12:05.470
You planning on losing?

12:06.439 --> 12:07.248
No.

12:07.273 --> 12:08.842
Then don't worry about it.

12:38.803 --> 12:40.325
I'm babysitting.
What are you doing here?

12:40.349 --> 12:42.244
Monica, you got to see this.

12:44.245 --> 12:45.536
Is Sherry home?

12:45.561 --> 12:47.279
No, but Mikey's in the other room, and I...

12:47.281 --> 12:48.667
Then it's fine.

12:48.692 --> 12:49.942
Make it quick.

12:52.443 --> 12:55.148
Alrighty.
Hey, there he is.

12:55.173 --> 12:57.283
- What up, little man?
- What up, Simon?

12:57.525 --> 12:58.588
OK...

12:59.064 --> 13:01.094
check this out.

13:01.096 --> 13:02.461
What are you watching?

13:02.463 --> 13:04.493
Wait for it. Wait for it.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.015
- Oh, snap.
- Let me see.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.029
- Did you see that?
- This is awful.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.177
You have to go.

13:10.202 --> 13:11.436
You have to go, OK?

13:11.438 --> 13:14.006
Mikey's mom's coming home soon, and you, sir,

13:14.031 --> 13:16.045
can't be caught watching this when she gets here.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.311
Later, Simon.

13:17.336 --> 13:18.808
Later, little dude.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.455
This is so much better than video games.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.640
What is this?

13:28.665 --> 13:30.166
This is me winning 250 bucks.

13:30.191 --> 13:31.724
You bet on this?

13:31.726 --> 13:34.052
OK, so they have The Truth 3 to 1.

13:34.077 --> 13:35.060
I mean, you can see why.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.397
He was a mean motherfucker, no doubt.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.599
So what I did, I ran the statistical analysis

13:39.601 --> 13:42.128
based on height, weight, wingspan.

13:42.153 --> 13:44.478
It just had the Mad Dog on top.

13:52.507 --> 13:53.940
So I just knew.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.433
He's dead, Simon.

14:01.458 --> 14:02.687
No, he's not dead.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.492
He's fucking dead.
Look at him.

14:06.044 --> 14:08.496
No, it's... It's a part
of the show.

14:08.521 --> 14:10.930
It's called sports and
entertainment for a reason.

14:10.955 --> 14:12.431
I mean, nobody's dying.
Come on.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.987
You have to go.
Sherry's going to be home soon, and I just...

14:15.012 --> 14:17.814
- Come on. I thought you'd be into this.
- No. Just go, please.

14:20.394 --> 14:21.750
We'll talk later.

14:21.775 --> 14:24.236
Wait, wait, wait, Monica, come on, it...

14:35.213 --> 14:37.763
Mikey, come on, honey.
We're going to be late. Hurry up.

14:50.049 --> 14:52.384
You really can't come over here like this.

14:53.094 --> 14:54.369
He's my son too, Sherry.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.508
Yeah, but this isn't your house anymore,

14:56.510 --> 14:59.469
so you got to, like, text me or something.

14:59.494 --> 15:01.641
- Dad!
- Hey, buddy.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.704
Hey, come here.

15:05.044 --> 15:06.264
You ready for your class today?

15:06.288 --> 15:08.083
- Yeah, I practiced all morning.
- You did?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.390
All right, well, let me see
what you got then, huh?

15:12.274 --> 15:13.808
Nice. Give me a good one
right here.

15:13.833 --> 15:16.917
Oh! Got some power
in there, huh?

15:16.942 --> 15:19.305
Why don't you go finish getting ready, bud, OK?

15:28.540 --> 15:29.774
I'm sorry.

15:30.477 --> 15:31.982
What are you sorry about?

15:32.818 --> 15:35.032
Huh? You sorry
about the fight?

15:35.057 --> 15:37.149
Because, really, there's so many of them
they just really blend together.

15:37.173 --> 15:39.539
I got to watch some drunk touch you like that?

15:40.242 --> 15:41.492
How do you expect me to act?

15:41.517 --> 15:43.843
Like a normal person.

15:43.868 --> 15:45.391
Because you're not a fighter anymore.

15:45.393 --> 15:47.002
Right? So...

15:52.398 --> 15:54.443
You know, my dad wanted me to be a cop.

15:55.311 --> 15:58.340
Well, it's a little bit too late for that.

16:01.676 --> 16:03.074
How much do I owe you?

16:05.892 --> 16:07.245
You're really going to do this?

16:07.247 --> 16:08.389
Come on, just give me a number.

16:08.413 --> 16:09.971
3.800 dollars.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.451
- Done.
- What?

16:13.657 --> 16:15.473
OK, you know what? I'm going
to believe that when I see that.

16:15.497 --> 16:17.361
Mikey, come on.
We have to go, now.

16:17.386 --> 16:19.161
Don't make me count to two.
Come on.

16:20.395 --> 16:21.472
Come here.

16:22.152 --> 16:24.207
All right, Daddy's going to walk
you to the car, all right?

16:24.231 --> 16:26.384
- Yeah.
- All right, go ahead.

16:26.907 --> 16:28.025
Love you, Dad.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.690
I love you too, buddy.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.090
Going to kick some butt today?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.646
Yo, let me get a hit.

16:40.648 --> 16:41.880
No, man.
Get your own.

16:41.882 --> 16:43.279
Shit's expensive.

16:43.304 --> 16:44.690
Just give him a hit.

16:45.636 --> 16:48.460
Have you guys heard about
this underground fight club?

16:49.694 --> 16:52.950
- Like that movie?
- No, no, in real life.

16:52.975 --> 16:54.569
- I think that's just a myth.
- Do you hear what they're saying?

16:54.593 --> 16:57.216
- I hear they fight to the death.
- I didn't watch it on the news.

16:57.241 --> 17:00.846
What the fuck does 'underground' mean to you?

17:01.097 --> 17:02.371
What's up, bitch?

17:02.396 --> 17:03.986
Just fuck off, Trent.

17:04.011 --> 17:05.473
What did you say?

17:05.785 --> 17:07.888
OK, man, what do you...
What do you want from me?

17:09.521 --> 17:11.723
Go get your fucking computer.

17:11.749 --> 17:13.512
You're such a dick.

17:13.513 --> 17:15.217
What's wrong with you?

17:19.394 --> 17:21.406
Oh, my God!

17:33.764 --> 17:35.752
Hey. What's up?

17:35.777 --> 17:38.629
Black male, about 25, beaten to death.

17:38.654 --> 17:40.309
Skull crushed, broken nose,

17:40.334 --> 17:42.815
teeth knocked into the back of his throat.

17:43.909 --> 17:46.993
- Any ID?
- No. But we think he's a drifter.

17:47.018 --> 17:50.616
Some of those kids swear they've seen him
hanging out over on Riverside.

17:50.618 --> 17:52.406
Those kids?
Let's talk to them.

17:53.469 --> 17:54.570
Hey.

17:54.711 --> 17:57.322
Hey, oh, I've seen you before.

17:57.324 --> 17:58.806
Aren't you a friend of Sherry Don's?

17:58.831 --> 18:00.359
Yes, sir.
My name is Monica.

18:00.361 --> 18:02.208
I babysit Mikey sometimes.

18:02.233 --> 18:05.102
- What's your name?
- Simon. Simon Aguilar.

18:05.563 --> 18:07.399
So you guys found the body, huh?

18:07.884 --> 18:08.984
Yeah?

18:09.462 --> 18:10.895
You ever seen him before?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.021
The guy?

18:12.904 --> 18:14.004
No.

18:16.331 --> 18:17.518
You sure about that?

18:18.190 --> 18:20.050
Well, he's just one of the homeless guys.

18:20.075 --> 18:22.580
I think I've seen him
beg for money by the Starbucks

18:22.582 --> 18:24.615
near the school.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.780
I think that's where we might have saw him.

18:27.258 --> 18:28.821
And what about you, Monica?

18:28.823 --> 18:31.406
- Hey, I just told you...
- Hey, shut up, I'm asking her.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.977
Monica?

18:34.203 --> 18:36.361
We've seen him up by the Riverside stop.

18:36.386 --> 18:39.539
- Yeah, that's where...
- I said shut up, I'm a cop. Are you stupid?

18:40.469 --> 18:41.569
Monica?

18:41.961 --> 18:43.902
He hangs out under the bridge sometimes.

18:43.927 --> 18:45.091
He does?

18:46.490 --> 18:47.873
Not anymore.

18:48.967 --> 18:52.154
OK, look, here.
My card. Both of you.

18:52.826 --> 18:54.389
Detective Jake Dawson.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.088
If you hear anything
that might help me in any way,

18:56.112 --> 18:57.737
you call me right away, OK?

18:57.909 --> 18:59.569
Take these skateboards and go on home now.

18:59.593 --> 19:01.553
You guys shouldn't
be back here anyway, all right?

19:01.787 --> 19:02.961
Go on.

19:04.124 --> 19:06.281
- He's bullshitting us.
- Of course they are.

19:06.508 --> 19:08.886
Anyway, it's cold as hell out here.

19:11.220 --> 19:14.800
Probably some coked-up junkie
whose drug deal went bad.

19:15.457 --> 19:16.909
Got his ass kicked?

19:17.176 --> 19:18.628
Got his ass kicked?

19:18.984 --> 19:20.440
Look at the body.

19:20.465 --> 19:22.541
How many junkies you know with arms like that?

19:23.050 --> 19:25.387
Uh-uh, this guy
can handle himself.

19:28.225 --> 19:29.994
And he didn't go down without a fight.

19:31.658 --> 19:33.056
Who is this guy?

19:34.493 --> 19:37.701
Hey look, let's let SAS do their thing.
Let's go, come on.

19:45.388 --> 19:48.269
All right, she wants a shot, he wants a shot.

19:48.294 --> 19:49.601
This guy looks thirsty over here.

19:49.603 --> 19:51.632
Yeah? You going to pay
for this or what?

19:51.657 --> 19:53.529
Let's just get a round of shots
for the entire bar.

19:53.553 --> 19:55.135
- What do you think of that?
- Well, great.

19:55.159 --> 19:57.576
He's buying the bar
over here, Mr. Slick.

19:57.601 --> 20:00.172
I got to do that, because I got
to stimulate the economy.

20:00.197 --> 20:02.410
And you can have shots, right?
It's important.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.022
This is insane.

20:04.047 --> 20:05.579
This is ridiculous.
You don't...

20:05.604 --> 20:08.721
You need to put this in
your hand and down the hatch.

20:08.723 --> 20:10.425
There we go.

20:13.590 --> 20:15.572
- It'll make you taller.
- Oh, thanks.

20:15.597 --> 20:17.361
It'll make you taller.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.801
Look, Sean, don't start any trouble.

20:23.428 --> 20:25.361
We already had enough of this.

20:25.690 --> 20:28.781
The economy.
That's what I'm here for, right?

20:29.872 --> 20:31.808
Yeah, I'm leaving anyway.

20:32.183 --> 20:33.345
Good.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.698
Now what?

20:52.032 --> 20:53.282
Follow me.

22:07.399 --> 22:08.649
Come on, man.

22:13.878 --> 22:15.269
Upstairs.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.716
This way. Come on.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.191
Good luck, sweetheart.

22:58.483 --> 23:00.220
Keep going.

24:14.346 --> 24:15.717
Athena...

24:16.187 --> 24:17.556
how's Santos?

24:21.592 --> 24:23.605
You taking care of him all right?

24:27.625 --> 24:29.159
You know...

24:29.184 --> 24:32.568
I could kill you, and no one would care.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.514
That's fair.

24:38.693 --> 24:39.994
After you.

25:26.417 --> 25:27.673
Hey, Sean.

25:30.324 --> 25:31.762
Good luck.

25:32.308 --> 25:34.183
I'll see you on the other side.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.857
Hello, Mr. Dillon.

26:19.198 --> 26:21.396
Welcome to the circus.

26:21.421 --> 26:22.794
Who is that?

26:22.952 --> 26:26.030
Forgive me.
My name is Santos.

26:26.055 --> 26:30.143
You met my assistant Deke, and my Athena.

26:30.932 --> 26:34.451
Why don't you come down here
so I can see your face, Mr. Santos?

26:34.476 --> 26:35.948
Photophobia.

26:35.973 --> 26:38.059
Exposure to light could be fatal,

26:38.084 --> 26:40.044
so I'm afraid that this will just have to do.

26:40.046 --> 26:42.515
Yeah, it's kind of hard to talk to an empty room.

26:42.540 --> 26:45.792
Oh, this room is
anything but empty, Mr. Dillon.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.995
You look around, you'll see an array

26:48.020 --> 26:49.530
of motion-sensor
video cameras

26:49.555 --> 26:51.616
stationed throughout the arena.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.677
All state-of-the-art.

26:55.305 --> 26:56.734
Arena?

26:57.297 --> 26:59.826
Of the technological age.

27:00.091 --> 27:02.851
And like your days as an MMA champion,

27:03.679 --> 27:07.048
your adoring fans are all online,

27:07.400 --> 27:11.591
watching your every move
from the comforts of their own computers.

27:11.616 --> 27:18.241
Rooting for you, cheering for you,
betting on you or against you.

27:18.475 --> 27:20.702
So it's a human cockfight.

27:21.327 --> 27:22.756
That's what this is?

27:22.781 --> 27:26.248
I like to think of it
as a business, Mr. Dillon.

27:26.273 --> 27:28.627
Just like any other enterprise.

27:28.629 --> 27:31.888
I trust Deke has explained the
lucrative financial incentives

27:31.913 --> 27:33.162
for your victory.

27:33.187 --> 27:34.811
And, assuming you win,

27:34.836 --> 27:36.582
you get a three-match
commitment.

27:36.607 --> 27:37.874
Yeah, he told me.

27:37.899 --> 27:40.304
Then let tonight's match begin.

27:41.185 --> 27:42.545
Best of luck.

27:42.570 --> 27:45.013
What, nobody's going to tell me the rules?

27:45.380 --> 27:48.750
The rules of the house are no different
than the rules of nature.

27:48.775 --> 27:51.205
Survival of the fittest.

27:59.756 --> 28:01.453
You look like a pussy.

28:02.968 --> 28:04.865
You look like a pussy.

28:05.233 --> 28:07.140
- I look like a pussy?
- Yeah.

28:07.165 --> 28:09.164
You don't know me? Huh?

28:13.579 --> 28:15.009
Come on, baby.
Come on.

28:15.034 --> 28:16.645
Wore the belt for three years, baby.
Come on.

28:16.669 --> 28:18.274
Not with me.

28:57.476 --> 28:59.113
- Come on.
- Bitch.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.541
Come on!

29:15.982 --> 29:18.863
That's it. It's over.
The fight is not over.

29:18.888 --> 29:20.884
Yeah, that's it.
I won.

29:21.408 --> 29:24.938
The fight is not over
until one combatant perishes.

29:26.077 --> 29:27.576
Perishes?

29:27.857 --> 29:29.414
What, you want me to kill him?

29:29.416 --> 29:31.215
Was I unclear?

29:31.217 --> 29:33.618
Kill or be killed,
Mr. Dillon.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.307
- I knocked him out.
- Kill him.

29:37.332 --> 29:38.518
No...

29:38.543 --> 29:40.334
Then be killed.

30:11.518 --> 30:15.508
Congratulations, Mr. Dillon.
You've advanced to the semifinals.

30:17.128 --> 30:19.423
Your next match is Wednesday.

30:19.704 --> 30:21.198
You think I'm going to fight again that day?

30:21.222 --> 30:24.305
But of course.
The prize money is doubled.

30:24.657 --> 30:28.372
From what I understand, you need every penny.

30:28.374 --> 30:31.028
Yeah, you know, I'm real tight
with a cop on the outside.

30:31.053 --> 30:33.157
Detective Jake Dawson.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.688
You'll do no such thing,
Mr. Dillon,

30:35.713 --> 30:38.393
unless you want to go to jail for murder.

30:38.596 --> 30:39.998
Murder?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.582
You fucking forced me!

30:42.607 --> 30:46.941
What you see has just been uploaded
to both Vimeo and YouTube.

30:47.348 --> 30:48.498
Worry not.

30:48.523 --> 30:51.440
This video is encrypted
and password-protected.

30:51.999 --> 30:56.621
No one can access the video
unless I allow it, of course.

30:56.902 --> 30:59.248
With a password, Detective Dawson,

30:59.273 --> 31:01.568
along with the entire police department,

31:01.593 --> 31:03.380
will be able to open the link.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.859
And when they do, this video will instantly

31:05.884 --> 31:09.080
be broadcast for the entire world to see.

31:09.082 --> 31:10.514
Within seconds,

31:10.516 --> 31:13.620
your brutal murder will go viral.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.541
You sick fuck.

31:15.854 --> 31:17.844
You sick fuck!
You set me up.

31:17.869 --> 31:19.704
You complete the tournament,

31:19.729 --> 31:21.601
just two more matches,

31:21.626 --> 31:23.783
collect your winnings, and then you will never

31:23.808 --> 31:25.734
hear or see me again.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.686
Good night, Mr. Dillon.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.881
Get some well-deserved rest.

31:29.906 --> 31:32.810
We look forward to seeing you again.

31:50.684 --> 31:51.884
Deke...

31:53.319 --> 31:54.567
Yes, sir?

31:54.864 --> 31:59.340
You understand the importance
of proper body disposal?

32:00.495 --> 32:01.635
Yes, sir.

32:01.792 --> 32:04.487
I was disappointed
by the police's swift discovery

32:04.512 --> 32:06.588
of the black man.

32:08.456 --> 32:10.969
Yes, Santos. I wanted to tell
you that won't happen again.

32:10.994 --> 32:12.502
It was just some bad luck.

32:12.527 --> 32:15.138
See that you're more careful this time.

32:15.482 --> 32:18.004
No more bad luck.

32:18.452 --> 32:20.485
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

32:27.784 --> 32:30.781
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to help me?

32:36.703 --> 32:37.973
On three.

32:39.343 --> 32:41.478
One, two, go.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.550
Housekeeping.

33:15.756 --> 33:17.626
Never mind the bouquet.

33:34.261 --> 33:35.366
Jake.

33:36.143 --> 33:37.249
Long time.

33:37.693 --> 33:39.074
I wish.

33:39.923 --> 33:42.382
- What is this there?
- Male, late 30s.

33:42.407 --> 33:44.502
Looks like a suicide.

33:44.832 --> 33:46.067
Who found him?

33:48.571 --> 33:51.309
She said she got no answer when she knocked.

33:51.311 --> 33:52.961
And then she came in.

33:53.891 --> 33:55.453
Body was here, wouldn't say hello?

33:55.478 --> 33:57.130
- Exactly.
- Yeah?

33:57.484 --> 33:59.850
- Anything else.
- You should check yourself.

33:59.852 --> 34:00.970
OK.

34:11.940 --> 34:14.666
Number one, this guy didn't commit suicide.

34:15.395 --> 34:18.370
He was killed, then he was dumped here.

34:18.371 --> 34:19.603
How do you know?

34:19.804 --> 34:21.739
From the incise, one on the wrist.

34:21.955 --> 34:23.774
No clotting, not enough blood to run.

34:23.775 --> 34:25.577
If this guy decided to off himself here,

34:25.922 --> 34:28.804
we'd be standing in a pool of blood right now.

34:30.183 --> 34:32.741
Oh, wow.
Look familiar?

34:34.254 --> 34:36.213
I used to think it was all bullshit.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.202
People talking about underground fighting.

34:38.226 --> 34:40.922
Fight clubs, Ring of Death, Blood Circus.

34:40.947 --> 34:42.975
But after what I've seen the last few days...

34:43.000 --> 34:43.837
Something's up.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.346
Two guys beaten to death.

34:45.371 --> 34:46.918
How often do you see that?

34:46.944 --> 34:48.918
Never.
Not here, anyway.

34:48.944 --> 34:53.014
If it is what you think it is,
fighters getting in the ring and dying,

34:53.835 --> 34:55.529
and nobody's talking,

34:55.927 --> 34:57.649
and no witnesses...

34:58.525 --> 34:59.945
then we got a problem.

35:01.046 --> 35:02.420
A big one.

35:02.952 --> 35:04.225
What's this?

35:04.542 --> 35:06.224
I did a little digging.

35:07.243 --> 35:08.852
Oh, I don't believe this.

35:09.681 --> 35:11.543
We got a problem.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.102
- Hey there, baby.
- Oh.

35:20.127 --> 35:23.554
You know, I got about 20 minutes
until my next meeting.

35:24.459 --> 35:25.836
Maybe we can go back there

35:25.838 --> 35:27.829
and make sure my suit's tucked in OK.

35:27.854 --> 35:29.491
- No, I'm good, I'm working.
- You look so fucking good.

35:29.515 --> 35:30.598
Would you get off me?

35:30.623 --> 35:33.497
Hey! What's going on here?

35:33.724 --> 35:35.970
- Who's this?
- Want me to get rid of this guy?

35:36.579 --> 35:37.728
Who is this person?

35:37.753 --> 35:39.431
My husband...
My ex-husband.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.375
You're the karate fighter, right?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.647
Rick, I think you should just go home.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.390
- Oh, really, Sherry?
- You heard her, Ricky.

35:48.671 --> 35:50.136
You get the fuck out of here.

35:50.161 --> 35:54.682
- What's your fucking problem?
- OK, Sean, let him go.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.870
You going to relax now, Ricky?

35:56.895 --> 35:58.555
- Let him go.
- Answer the fucking question.

35:58.579 --> 36:00.358
- Stop. Let him go.
- You going to relax now?

36:00.383 --> 36:01.553
- Aah! Yes!
- Yes?

36:01.578 --> 36:04.026
- Let him go, Sean.
- Get the fuck out, prick.

36:04.316 --> 36:06.097
- You know what?
- I'm sorry, Rick.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.241
- This is fucking bullshit.
- I'm sorry.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.948
Fuck the both of you.
Fuck you, and fuck you.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.446
I hope you got a good attorney, pal,

36:11.471 --> 36:12.771
because you're going to be hearing from mine.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.666
All right, karate man?
Why don't you get a real job?

36:14.690 --> 36:16.277
This place is a toilet.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.658
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, come on, Sherry.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.394
You don't need a guy like that.
He's a dick.

36:23.419 --> 36:26.765
A dick?
Like a guy who starts bar fights?

36:27.069 --> 36:29.878
Or continues to fuck with my life?

36:30.284 --> 36:31.623
- What I meant...
- No, you're right.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.283
I don't need a guy like that.

37:00.824 --> 37:02.250
What's that?

37:02.503 --> 37:04.043
What does it look like?

37:09.254 --> 37:11.177
3.800 dollars.

37:12.888 --> 37:14.147
Plus tip.

37:15.250 --> 37:17.821
Do I even want to know how you got this money?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.695
I earned it, Sherry.

37:20.249 --> 37:21.669
Just know that.

37:26.307 --> 37:28.143
I kept my promise.

37:38.494 --> 37:39.732
Thank you.

37:43.185 --> 37:45.546
- Hey, Rocco. It's cold, huh?

37:45.571 --> 37:48.261
- Want a drink?
- No, I'm on the clock.

37:48.807 --> 37:50.223
Is Sherry around?

37:50.637 --> 37:52.724
Yeah, she's in the kitchen.

37:52.749 --> 37:54.029
With Sean.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.090
I don't know what I'm going to do about this kid.

37:58.177 --> 38:00.149
Me too.
I wish it wasn't that way.

38:00.174 --> 38:02.010
Well, me too Jake.
Me too.

38:02.035 --> 38:03.334
Come on, Rocco.

38:03.591 --> 38:04.956
Give him some time.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.597
Come on, give him some time.

38:06.598 --> 38:09.167
He's my nephew,
he's your son-in-law.

38:10.342 --> 38:13.239
Oh, look.
My favorite couple.

38:14.753 --> 38:16.107
Uncle Jake.

38:17.867 --> 38:19.961
- What's going on?
- Sit down.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.002
You look good.

38:25.307 --> 38:28.218
Now look, I wanted to show you
something real quick, OK?

38:29.526 --> 38:30.631
You...

38:33.528 --> 38:36.833
you know anything about these guys,
you recognize or anything?

38:41.843 --> 38:42.941
No?

38:43.564 --> 38:44.810
Look a little closer.

38:45.005 --> 38:47.610
You sure you don't know these guys?
You're sure?

38:47.866 --> 38:49.883
No, I've never seen them.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.245
Who are they?

38:54.921 --> 38:57.784
That's what I'm trying to find out.
I was hoping you could help me.

38:59.263 --> 39:01.700
- Sorry.
- Oh, I got more.

39:01.725 --> 39:03.638
I got a whole lot more.
Oh, yeah.

39:03.872 --> 39:05.079
Here, look.

39:05.381 --> 39:07.181
This guy's from Detroit.

39:07.290 --> 39:08.742
New Orleans.

39:08.767 --> 39:10.188
Baltimore.

39:12.257 --> 39:14.288
Probably some crackheads or something, right?

39:15.224 --> 39:16.543
I don't think so.

39:16.935 --> 39:18.947
They look like fighters to me, actually.

39:19.143 --> 39:20.938
In fact, they look a lot like you.

39:20.963 --> 39:24.019
- Like me?
- Yeah, you know, same build...

39:24.441 --> 39:25.847
bruising, you know?

39:25.872 --> 39:28.456
This guy here, look.
He's got a warrior tattoo.

39:29.473 --> 39:31.542
That's some of that MMA bullshit, right?

39:33.974 --> 39:35.978
Sean, look at me.

39:37.338 --> 39:38.689
Look at me.

39:41.926 --> 39:43.928
You're my nephew, and I love you.

39:46.007 --> 39:47.109
OK?

39:48.156 --> 39:49.980
So, what do you know about this Blood Circus?

39:50.005 --> 39:51.058
Come on...

39:51.083 --> 39:52.285
I didn't...

39:56.130 --> 39:58.048
I guess I heard of it.

39:58.369 --> 40:00.411
You know, it's fairy-tale shit, though.

40:02.204 --> 40:03.632
Jake, it's made up.

40:03.907 --> 40:05.266
It's not real.

40:05.957 --> 40:07.326
I think it is real.

40:09.014 --> 40:10.881
It's happening in my town.

40:11.517 --> 40:14.738
Dead fighters, drifters, no families.

40:17.951 --> 40:19.057
And...

40:19.760 --> 40:21.394
you don't know anything about it, right?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.428
You're not involved in any of this?

40:24.800 --> 40:25.897
No?

40:26.072 --> 40:27.274
No.

40:30.953 --> 40:32.265
You're sure?

40:34.336 --> 40:35.648
I'm sure.

40:37.532 --> 40:40.432
If you're involved in what
I think you're involved in,

40:40.991 --> 40:43.030
if it doesn't kill you first,

40:43.374 --> 40:45.166
when I bust this up,

40:45.191 --> 40:47.615
and everyone and everything
that goes down with it,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.695
you're not going to be, you know?

40:51.028 --> 40:52.377
You understand me?

40:53.746 --> 40:55.176
- Sean...
- Yeah, I understand.

40:55.201 --> 40:57.435
- You understand me?
- I already told you.

40:58.337 --> 40:59.571
I understand.

41:02.008 --> 41:03.107
OK.

41:06.185 --> 41:07.767
Look after that eye, OK?

41:08.711 --> 41:11.485
- Rocco, Sherry, I got to go.
- Yeah, Jake.

41:30.063 --> 41:31.199
And he has family?

41:31.224 --> 41:33.355
- Yes.
- I know.

41:33.706 --> 41:35.610
Maybe if you came with me she'd be OK with it.

41:35.635 --> 41:37.975
I can ask.

41:39.275 --> 41:41.237
- You can find out?
- I guess.

41:41.262 --> 41:42.491
Monica.

41:43.015 --> 41:44.284
Come here, honey.

41:52.355 --> 41:54.291
- Hi.
- You can't arrest her.

41:54.316 --> 41:56.523
- We know her rights.
- Really?

41:56.548 --> 41:57.717
What are they?

41:58.046 --> 41:59.350
You can't...

42:01.104 --> 42:04.057
Yeah? Come on, get out of here.
Go away.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.626
Go.

42:08.262 --> 42:09.971
- I'm sorry about that.
- That's OK.

42:09.996 --> 42:11.741
So where's your boyfriend, the nerd?

42:12.099 --> 42:13.568
He's not my boyfriend.

42:16.530 --> 42:17.882
One more time.

42:18.874 --> 42:20.374
Where can I find him?

42:20.577 --> 42:21.818
I don't know.

42:22.057 --> 42:23.378
I think you do.

42:23.573 --> 42:25.926
In fact, I think you both know

42:25.951 --> 42:27.070
a lot more than you're telling me.

42:27.094 --> 42:29.569
So get in, fast.

42:49.912 --> 42:52.967
Come on!
Come on, motherfucker!

42:52.992 --> 42:54.528
Come on!

42:59.392 --> 43:01.361
Come on!

43:04.155 --> 43:05.688
What's your problem, man?

43:05.713 --> 43:07.094
Just so you know, my dad's a lawyer.

43:07.118 --> 43:09.808
He can fucking sue you for police brutality, man.

43:10.308 --> 43:12.559
Shut up, OK?
Just shut up.

43:13.503 --> 43:14.684
Relax.

43:15.476 --> 43:17.341
All right? Why were you running?

43:17.343 --> 43:19.679
I don't know.
I was fucking scared, man.

43:19.704 --> 43:21.042
What would you do if a cop was up your ass?

43:21.066 --> 43:22.668
I know.
Relax, all right?

43:22.693 --> 43:25.284
Just relax.
I ain't going to hurt you.

43:27.672 --> 43:28.983
Who are these guys?

43:29.282 --> 43:30.308
I don't know.

43:30.333 --> 43:33.294
Simon, I don't believe you.

43:34.604 --> 43:37.028
Come on, take a closer look.

43:37.873 --> 43:39.024
Well?

43:39.483 --> 43:41.050
OK, they're...

43:41.232 --> 43:43.673
I saw them on the Internet.
They're fighters.

43:43.698 --> 43:46.103
Like gladiators, even.

43:46.517 --> 43:48.316
Keep talking.
Where are they?

43:48.902 --> 43:50.941
So there's this online fight club, OK?

43:50.943 --> 43:52.748
It's called Blood Circus.

43:52.773 --> 43:54.563
What you do, you bet on these matches,

43:54.588 --> 43:55.587
and then you watch the fights.

43:55.612 --> 43:57.481
It's supposed to be like UFC,

43:57.483 --> 43:58.925
but it's just so much better.

43:58.950 --> 44:00.882
There's no rounds, no refs.

44:00.907 --> 44:03.395
It's just straight
balls-to-wall action.

44:03.420 --> 44:05.871
You know, it's all... last man standing.

44:06.356 --> 44:07.834
Last guy standing?

44:08.537 --> 44:09.793
Hang on.

44:11.075 --> 44:14.141
There's someplace in this town
where people are betting on...

44:14.166 --> 44:15.952
who lives and who dies?

44:19.266 --> 44:20.552
OK, pull it up.

44:21.318 --> 44:22.694
Well, I actually can't.

44:22.719 --> 44:24.339
Like, I'm not allowed back on the site.

44:24.364 --> 44:26.632
I tried hacking it. Look,
can you please not tell my dad?

44:26.657 --> 44:28.269
He will literally kill me, OK?

44:29.347 --> 44:31.672
I will handle your dad.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.140
Trust me.

44:33.475 --> 44:35.253
Come on, kid.
Pull it up.

44:36.168 --> 44:37.279
OK.

44:40.330 --> 44:42.158
- Oh, shit.
- What's the problem?

44:42.160 --> 44:44.143
I can't get in.
It's my dad's account.

44:44.168 --> 44:45.847
He must have changed the password or something.

44:45.871 --> 44:48.332
Fuck. Fuck.

44:48.334 --> 44:51.301
However, I do know there's
a fight going on tonight.

44:51.303 --> 44:53.104
It's supposed to be best one yet.

44:53.106 --> 44:55.701
Off the hook. They got a legit
MMA star this time.

44:55.726 --> 44:57.252
What'd you say?

44:57.277 --> 44:58.911
You know, an MMA fighter.

44:58.936 --> 45:01.352
Like a guy that knows what they're doing.

45:06.423 --> 45:08.457
Come on little bitch.

45:08.655 --> 45:10.760
Come on.

45:22.168 --> 45:24.438
Come on!

46:18.918 --> 46:20.641
Fucking punk bitch.

46:20.666 --> 46:22.135
Come on.

46:26.566 --> 46:28.135
Come on!

46:32.082 --> 46:33.515
Come on!

47:19.677 --> 47:22.153
Congratulations, Mr. Dillon.

47:22.155 --> 47:25.559
You've advanced to the finals, tomorrow night.

47:41.590 --> 47:43.407
Good night, Mr. Dillon,

47:43.409 --> 47:46.046
and get some
well-deserved rest.

48:45.391 --> 48:48.461
- Hey, boss.
- Make sure he's here tomorrow.

48:50.539 --> 48:51.993
I don't think he's coming back, boss.

48:52.017 --> 48:53.797
You make it so he has to come back.

48:53.822 --> 48:56.354
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes, sir.

48:56.379 --> 48:59.676
It would be a mistake to disappoint me again.

49:01.934 --> 49:03.770
I won't, boss. I promise.

49:04.950 --> 49:06.231
Fuck.

49:31.997 --> 49:34.896
Oh, my God.
What happened?

49:34.921 --> 49:36.242
Can I come in?

49:38.001 --> 49:39.576
I called Rocco.

49:42.958 --> 49:44.692
He said you weren't working.

49:45.093 --> 49:47.107
Mikey's not feeling well.

49:53.357 --> 49:54.649
I'm sorry.

49:58.893 --> 50:00.455
Ricky's a dick.
You were right.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.550
No, not just about that.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.076
About everything.

50:07.528 --> 50:09.087
Your lip's bleeding.

50:09.906 --> 50:11.624
I'll be right back.

50:23.699 --> 50:26.314
- You can't stay here.
- No, I know.

50:28.850 --> 50:31.019
I just didn't have anywhere else to go.

50:33.798 --> 50:35.332
So, what is it this time?

50:37.650 --> 50:40.184
You can't tell me that
you're not fighting anymore.

50:41.150 --> 50:42.761
It's not what you think.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.467
I needed the money.

50:48.008 --> 50:50.410
For you... for Mikey.

50:50.435 --> 50:52.400
We're just using that
as an excuse, right? Again.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.690
Don't use us as an excuse.

50:55.213 --> 50:57.033
This is the same old bullshit, Sean.

50:57.058 --> 50:59.084
No, it's not what you think.

50:59.109 --> 51:00.859
I understand perfectly.

51:00.884 --> 51:03.280
You go and you get the shit kicked out of you,

51:03.305 --> 51:05.373
and then you come over here
and you just expect us

51:05.398 --> 51:06.918
to pick up the pieces.

51:06.943 --> 51:09.626
You know, you're not going to be happy
until you're in a fucking body bag.

51:09.650 --> 51:11.191
- I am a fighter, Sherry.
- No, you're going to die.

51:11.215 --> 51:13.119
- You understand that?
- I am a fighter.

51:13.144 --> 51:15.419
And then where the fuck are we going to be, huh?

51:15.444 --> 51:18.326
Where does that leave me?
Where does that leave him?

51:19.772 --> 51:21.272
Fuck you.
You know what?

51:21.297 --> 51:22.903
You told me that you were
going to fucking change.

51:22.927 --> 51:24.535
And you tell me one other thing that I'm good at

51:24.559 --> 51:25.851
besides beating the piss out of somebody.

51:25.875 --> 51:28.351
You know, not everything is about you, Sean.

51:28.461 --> 51:30.094
- Mommy?
- Hey, honey.

51:30.119 --> 51:31.461
Hey, buddy.

51:32.519 --> 51:34.302
Hey, you feeling OK?

51:35.419 --> 51:37.065
What's wrong with your face?

51:37.090 --> 51:39.192
Oh, this is nothing.
Daddy's fine, bud.

51:39.217 --> 51:40.372
Come here.

51:41.442 --> 51:43.200
But... but you're bleeding.

51:43.225 --> 51:45.015
Oh, no, I'm all right.

51:45.017 --> 51:46.617
You're the one that's not feeling good.

51:46.619 --> 51:47.818
My stomach hurts.

51:47.820 --> 51:49.500
I know, bud.

51:49.525 --> 51:51.928
That's why you got to go
back to bed and sleep it off.

51:52.835 --> 51:54.668
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- Good night, honey.

51:54.692 --> 51:56.245
Good night, Mommy.

52:13.644 --> 52:15.671
I need to keep cleaning your face.

52:33.088 --> 52:34.241
Come here.

52:37.636 --> 52:39.253
Let me ask you a question.

52:41.500 --> 52:42.597
OK.

52:44.917 --> 52:47.274
How come after we split up...

52:49.449 --> 52:52.948
you didn't go out with anybody?

54:34.514 --> 54:37.169
Alex Aguilar, right?

54:38.475 --> 54:39.925
I'm Detective...

54:40.218 --> 54:41.593
Hang on, sir.

54:42.902 --> 54:45.614
Detective Jake Dawson.

54:46.020 --> 54:48.636
I'd like to ask you a couple
questions, if that's OK.

54:48.661 --> 54:49.875
What is this about?

54:49.900 --> 54:50.913
Is it about my son?

54:50.938 --> 54:53.972
No, it's not about your son.
It's about you.

54:56.210 --> 54:58.988
- Excuse me.
- Go back upstairs.

55:00.875 --> 55:02.336
What did I do?

55:02.657 --> 55:03.760
Come inside?

55:03.978 --> 55:06.371
No. You tell me right here
what it is and,

55:06.396 --> 55:07.772
tell me what the problem is.

55:08.413 --> 55:09.974
Really? OK.

55:10.513 --> 55:12.675
Well, OK, my department,
in accordance with the FBI,

55:12.700 --> 55:17.095
has been conducting a sweep of
these Internet gambling sites and,

55:18.275 --> 55:20.155
you're not going to believe whose name came up.

55:21.763 --> 55:23.267
See what's it about here?

55:24.019 --> 55:25.556
Come inside. Come in.

55:26.673 --> 55:27.795
OK.

55:39.058 --> 55:40.673
Oh, it's OK.
Thanks a lot.

55:40.966 --> 55:42.549
Listen, I thought it was legal.

55:42.574 --> 55:44.441
- Yeah.
- I had no idea.

55:44.466 --> 55:45.785
I thought you had lawyers, you know?

55:45.809 --> 55:47.461
Look at the fine print, no?

55:47.673 --> 55:50.203
No. Look, it was a one-time thing.

55:50.228 --> 55:51.871
A buddy from college told me about it.

55:51.896 --> 55:53.560
I didn't believe him at first.

55:53.868 --> 55:55.700
No? So what are we
talking about?

55:55.725 --> 55:57.054
The Blood Circus, right?

55:57.079 --> 55:58.852
Yeah, that's what he called it.

55:58.877 --> 56:01.255
It's not like something you
can look up online. It...

56:01.892 --> 56:03.354
There's a ton of security.

56:03.379 --> 56:04.524
It's crazy.

56:04.549 --> 56:06.274
Where is it going down?
Do you know?

56:06.299 --> 56:07.863
No, nobody knows.

56:10.366 --> 56:13.074
Hey, did you use this computer right here?

56:13.099 --> 56:14.371
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really?

56:14.396 --> 56:15.997
OK, show me.

56:26.503 --> 56:27.993
It's not working.

56:29.545 --> 56:30.849
Can I give it a try?

56:31.046 --> 56:32.927
All right, go ahead.

56:34.545 --> 56:35.822
OK.

56:42.498 --> 56:44.310
How did you learn how to do this?

56:44.582 --> 56:46.899
I saw it watching you, and I was able to hack in.

56:46.924 --> 56:48.969
Where did you learn how to do this?

56:49.484 --> 56:50.839
Well, you were always gone,

56:50.864 --> 56:52.835
so I had to do something while you were away.

56:52.860 --> 56:54.769
All right, and...

56:55.751 --> 56:56.642
here we go.

56:56.667 --> 56:57.842
Is that it?

56:57.867 --> 56:59.413
Yeah, that's the ring.

57:00.331 --> 57:01.420
Were you able to track the site?

57:01.444 --> 57:04.528
- Yeah, yeah, I can try.
- OK, try.

57:08.774 --> 57:10.021
Oh, shit.

57:10.046 --> 57:11.908
- What happened?
- It's gone, forget it.

57:11.910 --> 57:13.189
Were you able to save anything though, kid?

57:13.213 --> 57:15.646
- You know, grab anything?
- Yeah, I got a screenshot.

57:15.648 --> 57:17.910
You did? Really?
Email it to me.

57:18.474 --> 57:20.102
I can do better than that.

57:20.856 --> 57:22.416
Just sent it to your phone.

57:22.441 --> 57:23.565
Oh, you did.

57:25.046 --> 57:26.390
Yeah. Thanks.

57:26.796 --> 57:29.552
OK, you recognize this place?

57:29.577 --> 57:30.880
Where is it?

57:30.905 --> 57:32.512
No, it doesn't look familiar.

57:32.537 --> 57:33.829
Look really close.

57:33.831 --> 57:35.163
No, haven't seen it.

57:35.346 --> 57:37.197
No? Damn.

57:38.556 --> 57:39.750
All right, all right.

57:39.775 --> 57:42.175
Well, thanks for your effort, OK?

57:42.200 --> 57:45.262
And you two stay out of trouble, OK?

57:45.287 --> 57:48.579
I got to go.
Like father, like son.

58:07.043 --> 58:08.213
- Hey.
- Jesus.

58:08.238 --> 58:10.100
- Hey, we got to talk.
- What, kid?

58:10.125 --> 58:12.938
- We got to talk.
- Get in... OK, get in. Get in. Hurry up.

58:27.527 --> 58:28.919
How are you pancakes, buddy?

58:29.199 --> 58:31.041
- They're OK.
- Yeah?

58:32.206 --> 58:34.359
Did you see that flip, buddy?
Did you see that?

58:34.602 --> 58:36.959
Oh! Not bad, huh?

58:36.961 --> 58:38.440
Uh...

58:39.416 --> 58:41.965
- OK.
- Sure? Come on, now.

58:41.990 --> 58:44.005
Those the best pancakes you've ever had?

58:44.249 --> 58:45.901
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58:46.835 --> 58:48.006
Better than your mom's?

58:48.031 --> 58:49.815
- No.
- No?

58:50.036 --> 58:51.707
What do you mean, no?

58:53.537 --> 58:55.027
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

58:55.052 --> 58:57.046
- You feel better?
- All better.

58:57.048 --> 58:58.314
Dad, we're having pancakes.

58:58.316 --> 59:00.921
- Yeah, I see that.
- Have some.

59:02.804 --> 59:04.554
Yeah, come on.
Take a seat, babe.

59:04.938 --> 59:07.116
I need to talk to your dad.

59:08.885 --> 59:10.037
OK.

59:14.023 --> 59:15.314
What's up?

59:15.892 --> 59:18.158
This is... Like,
this is a little bit much.

59:18.183 --> 59:21.100
Hey, don't think so much.

59:21.460 --> 59:22.696
Look at him.

59:23.501 --> 59:25.505
Come on, look how happy he is.

59:34.764 --> 59:36.448
What kind of trouble are you in?

59:43.880 --> 59:45.129
Sherry...

59:47.458 --> 59:49.451
I got pulled in one more time.

59:49.836 --> 59:52.806
Trust me when I tell you everything is fine.

59:54.054 --> 59:57.013
Baby? Hey, it's over.

59:57.700 --> 59:59.411
It's over, OK?

59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.076
What's done is done.

01:00:02.454 --> 01:00:04.323
I'm not going to fight anymore.

01:00:08.966 --> 01:00:10.675
Here, take this.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.205
- What the hell am I supposed to do with that?
- Just take it.

01:00:12.229 --> 01:00:13.582
Whatever you want.

01:00:13.607 --> 01:00:14.806
OK? Just take it.

01:00:14.831 --> 01:00:17.101
Baby, take the fucking money.

01:00:19.556 --> 01:00:21.923
Just act normal.
Don't say nothing.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.100
OK? I'm going to go,
clean myself up.

01:00:25.383 --> 01:00:26.985
Things are going to be fine.

01:00:30.133 --> 01:00:31.279
OK?

01:00:36.414 --> 01:00:38.723
Hey, everything is going to be all right.

01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:40.676
OK?

01:00:44.911 --> 01:00:47.677
Come on, pancakes are getting cold.

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:53.593
All right, little man.
See you later, OK?

01:00:53.618 --> 01:00:54.850
Hey, who are you calling little?

01:00:54.874 --> 01:00:56.386
I'm calling you little.

01:00:57.113 --> 01:00:58.599
See you later, buddy.

01:01:00.768 --> 01:01:02.799
- Say goodbye to your dad.
- Bye.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.936
Bye, buddy. I love you.

01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:13.617
- There is no way I'm taking you with me.
- You kind of have no choice.

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:15.507
No offense, you know shit about computers.

01:01:15.532 --> 01:01:17.767
Hey, look, kid, it's just too risky, OK?
I can't do it.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:19.555
Look, I'll stay in the car,
you'll be doing your thing,

01:01:19.579 --> 01:01:21.391
and I'll tell you where to go.

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.673
Besides, you'll be doing a good deed, Detective.

01:01:23.698 --> 01:01:25.325
A good deed? How's that?

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:27.624
Just think about this, like, career day,

01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:29.382
or a school field trip, you know?

01:01:29.407 --> 01:01:31.568
I'll learn a thing or two, shadow you.

01:01:31.593 --> 01:01:34.625
Besides, I might decide
to be a detective one day.

01:01:35.882 --> 01:01:37.386
God help us.

01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:42.063
- What are you building there, buddy?
- A statue.

01:01:42.088 --> 01:01:44.481
- A statue. What kind of statue?
- A person.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.949
A person. I see it.
The head?

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.843
What did Mommy forget, huh?

01:01:57.992 --> 01:01:59.659
Can I help you?

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.366
Mikey! Come on, let's go!

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.209
Hide, Mikey!
Run, run! Go, go, go!

01:02:12.234 --> 01:02:13.803
Fast, go! Hide!

01:02:14.654 --> 01:02:16.556
- Where's the kid?
- What do you want?

01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:19.029
- Where's the kid?
- Leave him alone!

01:02:19.054 --> 01:02:20.416
Shut up!

01:02:20.418 --> 01:02:21.739
- Leave him alone!
- Get the kid.

01:02:21.764 --> 01:02:25.488
- Don't touch him! Don't touch him!
- Shut your mouth! Shut up!

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.138
- Shut up!
- Mikey! Aah!

01:02:27.163 --> 01:02:28.591
Get the stupid shit!

01:02:28.593 --> 01:02:30.292
Shut up! Shut...

01:02:30.294 --> 01:02:33.463
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Shut up!

01:02:34.801 --> 01:02:36.321
Mikey!

01:03:41.021 --> 01:03:43.553
- Yo, Devo!
- What?

01:03:45.353 --> 01:03:47.821
You find the little shit stain yet?

01:03:48.462 --> 01:03:49.709
No!

01:03:50.933 --> 01:03:52.756
Well, get up here.

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:15.082
Bro, where the hell you been?

01:05:15.107 --> 01:05:16.955
We have been looking everywhere for you.

01:05:17.802 --> 01:05:19.193
What are you doing here?

01:05:19.696 --> 01:05:22.525
Checking on Santos's investment.

01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.596
I told you, I'm done with that shit.

01:05:25.918 --> 01:05:28.119
He wants to release the video, go ahead.

01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:30.097
I'm not scared anymore.

01:05:30.122 --> 01:05:31.560
You're not scared of prison?

01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:32.876
No, I'm not,

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.681
because I don't think Santos is going to do shit.

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:39.555
And if he does, I promise you,
I'm not going down alone.

01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:42.794
You got to honor your commitment, slick.

01:05:42.819 --> 01:05:44.924
- My commitment?
- Yeah.

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:47.986
Killing people was never part of the deal.

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.561
It was always part of the deal.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:54.402
It's fight or die, Sean.
Just like life.

01:05:54.823 --> 01:05:56.902
Santos wants you at the house now.

01:05:56.927 --> 01:05:59.489
Just do this last fight,
collect your money and be done.

01:05:59.514 --> 01:06:01.553
You never got to see our asses again.

01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:04.961
Get the fuck off my property.

01:06:06.814 --> 01:06:08.478
We got Mikey.

01:06:09.614 --> 01:06:11.179
What did you say?

01:06:12.717 --> 01:06:14.029
We got Mikey.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.718
Don't you fuck with me.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.971
What did you just say?

01:06:16.996 --> 01:06:20.521
Santos made the order.
I told you, we weren't done.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:21.879
Call him.

01:06:21.904 --> 01:06:23.394
You call him right now.

01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:25.695
- Sean...
- Don't fuck with me!

01:06:26.564 --> 01:06:27.597
You call him right now.

01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:30.332
I swear to God, if he hurts him
I will fucking kill you.

01:06:31.232 --> 01:06:32.469
Let me go.

01:06:33.604 --> 01:06:34.946
Let me go.

01:06:36.876 --> 01:06:38.642
He doesn't care about me.

01:06:40.536 --> 01:06:43.630
Without you, he'll kill me
like he kills everyone else.

01:06:43.895 --> 01:06:46.739
He'll find another fucking geek,
and another one after that.

01:06:46.764 --> 01:06:48.565
He's a puppeteer.

01:06:50.285 --> 01:06:52.214
There's only one way to play this.

01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:54.957
Just do this.

01:06:54.982 --> 01:06:56.691
You get your son back.

01:07:02.845 --> 01:07:04.067
Let's go.

01:07:20.179 --> 01:07:21.920
Hey, Mon, what's up?

01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:25.287
Wait, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.

01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:26.485
What happened?

01:07:27.165 --> 01:07:28.415
Wait, what?

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.469
Holy shit, where is he?
Where is he right now?

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:35.275
What do you mean you don't know?

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.062
Sherry, what's going on?

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:38.635
They took Mikey.
Somebody took Mikey.

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:40.502
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know who took Mikey.

01:07:40.526 --> 01:07:42.945
- Who took... what are you talking about?
- Can you

01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:44.803
- What a...
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:45.936
What?

01:07:47.926 --> 01:07:50.629
OK. Just stay where you are.

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:53.321
We're going to get somebody to come get you.

01:07:54.889 --> 01:07:58.200
- Jesus, Dad...
- It's going to be OK, it's going to be OK.

01:08:03.207 --> 01:08:04.405
Dawson.

01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:06.385
Hi, Rocco. What?

01:08:06.947 --> 01:08:10.315
Hang on...
Just slow down and let me talk to her.

01:08:16.294 --> 01:08:18.729
Listen to me.
Just stay there.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.350
Just stay there.

01:08:21.453 --> 01:08:23.029
- What happened?
- They kidnapped Mikey.

01:08:23.054 --> 01:08:26.720
- What?
- Yeah, and Monica... just bruised up. She'll be fine.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.408
I know.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.358
Why are they doing this?

01:08:34.314 --> 01:08:35.519
Sean.

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:37.443
They're going to force him to fight.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.796
Son of a bitch.

01:08:40.295 --> 01:08:42.582
It's going to go on tonight.
We got to find them.

01:08:42.608 --> 01:08:44.054
I-I-I don't know
how to track them.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:47.352
Come on, just do it. Just do it.
We're gonna run out of time.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.541
Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:52.529
We don't have to find the location.

01:08:52.555 --> 01:08:55.528
We'll bring the location to us.

01:08:56.589 --> 01:08:59.156
So we track Sean's phone number.

01:08:59.413 --> 01:09:00.444
You got it?

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.569
- In my contacts.
- OK.

01:09:22.682 --> 01:09:25.432
Where is he?
Your son is so cute.

01:09:27.545 --> 01:09:29.640
Save it for the fight.

01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:35.423
- Good evening, Mr. Dillon.
- Where's my son?

01:09:35.448 --> 01:09:37.671
I was concerned you might break your commitment.

01:09:37.696 --> 01:09:39.821
I'm sure you understand.

01:09:40.057 --> 01:09:41.569
Where's Mikey?

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.544
Your son is fine.

01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:45.812
He's with me.

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:47.959
You hurt him, I swear to God...

01:09:47.984 --> 01:09:49.218
Mr. Dillon,

01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:52.279
you're really in no position to make demands.

01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:54.078
You and I had a deal.

01:09:54.314 --> 01:09:55.519
Daddy...

01:09:56.607 --> 01:09:57.813
Daddy.

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.810
Don't you hurt him.

01:09:59.835 --> 01:10:02.831
This is much bigger
than you and me, Mr. Dillon.

01:10:02.856 --> 01:10:04.706
Don't you see?

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:07.466
The world is watching.

01:10:11.688 --> 01:10:13.875
Let the games begin.

01:10:28.884 --> 01:10:30.506
You don't have to do this.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.020
You hear me?

01:10:33.045 --> 01:10:35.014
He's just gonna to kill you.

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.365
- OK, got him.
- Where is he?

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:41.998
He's at the edge of town,
in a warehouse on River Road.

01:10:42.023 --> 01:10:44.268
What did you get yourself into?
Shit.

01:10:44.503 --> 01:10:47.474
How do you think this asshole
stays in business, huh?

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.123
No survivors means no witnesses.

01:10:51.717 --> 01:10:53.869
You hear what I'm saying?

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:57.821
- Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
- Fuck you!

01:11:14.961 --> 01:11:16.157
Is this it?

01:11:17.213 --> 01:11:19.040
- They're in there.
- Let's go.

01:11:19.724 --> 01:11:20.974
Follow me.

01:11:28.915 --> 01:11:33.693
Get the fuck off of me! Fuck off...

01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:41.174
Get up, motherfucker.
Let's go.

01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:47.591
Come on.

01:12:10.156 --> 01:12:11.374
Come on.

01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:18.140
Go. Be careful.

01:12:48.175 --> 01:12:50.441
That's as far as you go, pig.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.700
Come on.

01:13:09.725 --> 01:13:11.140
Simon, let's go.

01:13:15.147 --> 01:13:17.668
Drop the weapon. Drop it.
Put the weapon down.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.470
You drop it.

01:13:29.741 --> 01:13:31.240
You bitch.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.872
Yeah, suck on that, bitch.

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:43.336
Fuck her. Come on.

01:13:43.361 --> 01:13:46.257
Simon, get your head in the game.
Let's go.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.577
You hear me?

01:14:05.522 --> 01:14:07.663
You hear what I'm saying to you?

01:14:07.688 --> 01:14:09.760
Win or lose, you die.

01:14:10.873 --> 01:14:13.243
- You hear me?
- Fuck you!

01:14:15.066 --> 01:14:17.101
What are you waiting for? Fight.

01:14:17.943 --> 01:14:19.786
You got kids? Huh?

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:21.569
You got a family?

01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:23.428
Because he's got my little boy up there.

01:14:23.452 --> 01:14:26.251
- What?
- He's got my kid up there.

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:39.529
Kill him.

01:14:40.002 --> 01:14:42.295
What are you waiting for?

01:14:45.174 --> 01:14:47.503
What are you waiting for?

01:14:49.299 --> 01:14:51.205
Fight, you animals!

01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:54.486
Kill or be killed!

01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:14.017
- You, drop!
- Jake, he's good.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.356
- He's with me.
- Who is he?

01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:18.026
Let me look at you.
Come here. Come here!

01:15:18.028 --> 01:15:19.497
He's good.
He's just trying to help.

01:15:19.522 --> 01:15:20.772
Who is he?

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.002
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

01:15:23.027 --> 01:15:24.233
- What?
- He's not here.

01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:25.574
Hold on a second.
Somebody's here.

01:15:25.599 --> 01:15:26.779
The screen's lighting up like crazy.

01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:28.560
OK, look, let's spread out
and look for him right now.

01:15:28.584 --> 01:15:30.387
Come on, come on.

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:32.539
Come on, let's go find the kid.

01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:25.027
- Daddy.
- Mr. Dillon.

01:16:25.429 --> 01:16:28.114
Your son is a lovely young boy.

01:16:28.139 --> 01:16:30.780
What do you...
What do you want from us?

01:16:30.805 --> 01:16:33.767
I want you to kill.
I want you to fight.

01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:38.154
Every drop of blood, is money in my pocket.
That's why I chose you.

01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:41.015
Killing my son is not going to make me fight.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.204
You don't care about your life.

01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:47.119
If you did, you wouldn't fight
like an animal for petty cash.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:50.108
Incentivize.
That's what I do.

01:16:56.357 --> 01:16:58.719
Sean. Go, go.

01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:01.560
Simon, stay here.

01:17:47.009 --> 01:17:48.978
Hey. Hey, kid.

01:17:51.059 --> 01:17:53.949
Simon, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's all right.

01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:56.509
No, no, no you didn't.
No, you didn't.

01:17:56.534 --> 01:17:58.703
I killed him, hey!
No, you didn't, hey!

01:17:58.728 --> 01:18:01.762
No, you didn't.
I killed him, OK?

01:18:01.787 --> 01:18:04.150
- Simon.
- What are we going to do?

01:18:04.175 --> 01:18:06.110
Simon, you didn't kill him, right?

01:18:06.135 --> 01:18:08.670
Listen, I don't have time for this.
You hear me right now.

01:18:08.695 --> 01:18:11.499
You didn't kill anybody. I killed him, OK?
Say, 'You killed him'.

01:18:11.501 --> 01:18:13.942
- You killed him.
- OK, let's go.

01:18:13.967 --> 01:18:15.870
Simon, who killed him?

01:18:15.895 --> 01:18:17.120
You did it.

01:18:31.255 --> 01:18:33.434
I'm glad to see you got out.

01:18:33.663 --> 01:18:35.149
I'll be in touch.

01:18:46.171 --> 01:18:48.404
- Hey, buddy.
- I'm OK.

01:18:51.103 --> 01:18:52.277
Hello?

01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:57.479
Yeah. Yeah, I know
exactly where that is.

01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:59.516
All right. Dad, I got to go.
He's fine.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:01.033
He's OK?

01:19:01.058 --> 01:19:03.185
- Let me go with you.
- Stay by the phone.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.340
- You sure?
- Stay by the phone.

01:19:16.845 --> 01:19:18.017
Mikey.

01:19:18.991 --> 01:19:20.937
Speak to me. Speak to me.

01:19:21.447 --> 01:19:22.671
Are you OK?

01:19:22.696 --> 01:19:24.433
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.510
Are you OK?

01:19:28.512 --> 01:19:29.743
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:19:29.768 --> 01:19:31.408
What did he see?

01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:34.181
A lot. He's tough, though.

01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:37.113
- I know, I wonder where you get that from.
- What happened?

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:39.013
Simon saved my life.

01:19:39.038 --> 01:19:41.450
You make sure that little
girlfriend of his finds out, OK?

01:19:41.475 --> 01:19:43.582
She's not my girlfriend.

01:19:43.607 --> 01:19:45.698
I don't think that's going
to be a problem anymore.

01:19:45.723 --> 01:19:48.831
Hey, Sherry, get my nephew home to bed.
It's been a long day, OK?

01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:50.246
- Yeah.
- What about...?

01:19:50.271 --> 01:19:53.331
Don't worry about it, OK? I'm a cop.
I'll think of something.

01:19:53.602 --> 01:19:54.876
You two go home.

01:19:54.901 --> 01:19:56.558
- Well, what about me?
- Stick around.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.312
I think you're going to come in handy.

01:19:58.337 --> 01:19:59.742
Jake, I really don't know what to say.

01:19:59.744 --> 01:20:01.543
Just cover my tab at the bar
next time, all right?

01:20:01.545 --> 01:20:02.602
I'm going to need some drinks when this is over.

01:20:02.626 --> 01:20:03.772
OK.

01:20:13.154 --> 01:20:14.267
Sean.

01:20:18.637 --> 01:20:19.903
I know.

01:20:19.928 --> 01:20:21.037
OK.
