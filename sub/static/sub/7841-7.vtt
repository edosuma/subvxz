Lame, lame,

lame, lame, have it, lame,

Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies,

01:28.205 --> 01:31.155
Caveman Robin, Black Robin,
Born-Again Robin.

01:32.409 --> 01:35.442
The infamous Wolverine comic
with pop-out claws.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.681
Why was this
so controversial?

01:42.166 --> 01:44.112
Nice work,
Doctor Boo-Who.

01:44.116 --> 01:47.030
Your tears have smudged
Wolverine's iconic sideburns.

01:47.031 --> 01:48.982
Hence, you must buy this comic.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.544
And the cost of your
innocent accident is....

01:52.812 --> 01:54.853
$25, please.

01:54.859 --> 01:57.003
But that's the money Yaya Sofia

01:57.008 --> 02:00.001
gave me for Greek
Orthodox Easter.

02:00.006 --> 02:02.493
I hate when they tell me
things about themselves.

02:02.496 --> 02:04.592
You should stop being
so mean to us kids.

02:04.597 --> 02:06.532
Well, I suppose you could buy

02:06.546 --> 02:08.030
your comics somewhere else.

02:08.038 --> 02:10.411
Maybe they sell comics
at the dry cleaners.

02:10.416 --> 02:11.009
No?

02:11.026 --> 02:13.403
Perhaps they sell comics
at the mattress store

02:13.408 --> 02:14.051
No!

02:14.055 --> 02:16.382
Perhaps you could buy your
comics at that new

02:16.398 --> 02:18.791
comic bookstore
across the street?

02:18.985 --> 02:20.411
Philip K. Dick.

02:20.425 --> 02:21.312
It can't be.

02:21.318 --> 02:22.400
It's as if Superman

02:22.408 --> 02:23.552
moved to Gotham City.

02:23.555 --> 02:27.553
Which he did,
in World's Finest Comics nÂ°24.

02:27.555 --> 02:28.451
See.

02:28.508 --> 02:30.330
That was an imaginary
story dreamt

02:30.335 --> 02:32.700
by Jimmy Olsen after he
was kicked in the head

02:32.706 --> 02:34.091
by Supergirl's horse, Comet.

02:34.097 --> 02:35.163
It never really happened.

02:35.178 --> 02:37.480
None of these things
ever really happened.

02:38.278 --> 02:40.041
Get out of my store.

02:42.325 --> 02:43.682
Grand opening!

02:47.635 --> 02:49.151
Hey what up, you guys?

02:49.158 --> 02:51.081
How g-g-g-goes it?

02:51.085 --> 02:52.371
My name's Milo,

02:52.376 --> 02:54.080
and this is Coolsville.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.650
Now listen, before everyone chills

02:55.656 --> 02:57.702
with some sweet comic B's,

02:57.705 --> 02:59.081
everyone gets a free piece

02:59.088 --> 03:00.671
of Japanese hard candy.

03:00.676 --> 03:01.570
One for you.

03:01.575 --> 03:02.662
Short kid in back.

03:02.665 --> 03:03.561
Down low.

03:03.566 --> 03:04.331
Go long.

03:04.337 --> 03:05.991
I got prawn.

03:07.565 --> 03:08.061
Mmm.

03:08.066 --> 03:09.472
I got miso.

03:11.225 --> 03:11.641
Mmm.

03:11.645 --> 03:13.240
I got dolphin.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.462
Now, I hope you
all like Korean

03:16.465 --> 03:18.822
pop covers of
Tom Jones songs,

03:18.825 --> 03:20.753
'cause they're about
to be blasted.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.801
<i>Hanyong, pussycat?</i>

03:23.807 --> 03:25.720
<i>Wah, wah, wah-ah...</i>

03:25.727 --> 03:27.650
<i>Hanyong, pussycat...</i>

03:27.657 --> 03:29.073
<i>Wah, wah,</i>

03:29.086 --> 03:31.093
<i>wah-aaaaaaaaaaah...</i>

03:33.508 --> 03:35.381
<i>pussycat, pussycat,</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:46.732
Asterix!

03:46.735 --> 03:47.612
Tintin!

03:47.616 --> 03:48.893
I heard these only existed

03:48.896 --> 03:50.900
in high school French classes.

03:53.508 --> 03:55.690
Come on, Snowy, we
must save the Belgian

03:55.696 --> 03:57.640
ambassador from
the Black Orchid Gang.

03:58.508 --> 03:59.383
What's that?

03:59.386 --> 04:00.790
A sound of ignition?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.012
Zut, alors!

04:03.985 --> 04:06.892
This castle is actually
a four-stage rocket

04:06.895 --> 04:09.811
and it's headed straight
for the Pompidou Center.

04:13.397 --> 04:14.790
Oh, no, I ripped it.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.452
Hey, no worries,
little lady.

04:17.456 --> 04:20.161
These books are meant to
be read and enjoyed,

04:20.165 --> 04:23.021
not hoarded and then sold
when you get divorced.

04:23.028 --> 04:25.381
Wow!
He's so cool.

04:25.645 --> 04:27.290
All right,
I get it.

04:27.295 --> 04:29.772
You're cool,
you're not "mainstream,"

04:29.778 --> 04:31.593
You wear a porkpie hat.

04:31.606 --> 04:34.401
Mmm... porkpie.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.513
But let's see what you know
about superheroes.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.442
Hey, I'm all about
the capes.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.510
Flame on.

04:40.518 --> 04:42.243
Who's stronger?
The Thung or The Mulk?

04:42.245 --> 04:43.293
And show your work.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.130
Whoa, oh, head rush.

04:45.136 --> 04:45.810
Okay,

04:46.015 --> 04:49.352
well, the Mulk kicked a
tidal wave into the sun,

04:49.365 --> 04:50.280
whereas...

04:50.287 --> 04:54.491
The Thung gave a piggyback
ride to the 1985 Chicago Bears.

04:54.615 --> 04:56.501
Hoo, boy, that's a tough one.

04:57.036 --> 04:58.193
What do you think?

04:58.598 --> 05:00.053
You want to know what I think?

05:00.055 --> 05:01.981
Does Galactus eat planets?

05:01.986 --> 05:04.023
Of course I do.

05:04.028 --> 05:04.892
Wow.

05:04.898 --> 05:08.021
I was in such a bad relationship
with my ex-Comic Book Guy,

05:08.026 --> 05:09.980
I'd forgotten how good it could be.

05:10.596 --> 05:11.923
Mmm.

05:13.785 --> 05:14.680
Bye, Bart.

05:14.686 --> 05:16.452
Enjoy your funny books.

05:18.757 --> 05:19.781
Look, Maggie,

05:19.785 --> 05:21.810
I'm Wonder Woman.

05:22.386 --> 05:23.513
Oh.

05:23.525 --> 05:25.131
I've lost my perfect

05:25.135 --> 05:27.871
26-26-26 figure.

05:27.876 --> 05:30.891
Never compare yourself to a standee.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.882
Hey, you're way skinnier
than a lot of superheroes.

05:33.886 --> 05:35.913
Girthquake, Flaberella.

05:35.916 --> 05:36.842
Kearney's Mom.

05:36.905 --> 05:37.443
Shut up!

05:37.478 --> 05:39.490
Her depression medication
makes her bloated.

05:39.497 --> 05:41.520
She's depressed 'cause you're so lame.

05:41.526 --> 05:42.320
Shut up!

05:44.918 --> 05:46.560
Ooh, I'd better join a gym

05:46.567 --> 05:49.013
before I go from hippy to hippo.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.132
I wish my Mom said
cute things like that.

05:51.135 --> 05:52.641
She can't 'cause she's depressed.

05:52.655 --> 05:53.441
Shut up.

05:57.705 --> 06:01.510
Look at all these alternative
comic book creators.

06:01.517 --> 06:02.601
Alan Moore,

06:02.605 --> 06:03.941
Art Spiegelman.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.471
Oh, Dan Clowes.

06:06.545 --> 06:09.421
I really identified with
the girls in Ghost World.

06:09.426 --> 06:12.183
They made me feel
like I wasn't so alone.

06:12.188 --> 06:13.841
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

06:13.848 --> 06:16.002
Do you know anyone who works at Batman?

06:16.007 --> 06:18.561
'Cause I really want to draw Batman.

06:18.677 --> 06:21.053
I'm awesome at utility belts.

06:21.057 --> 06:22.072
Check these out.

06:22.106 --> 06:24.171
This is where the Batman
keeps his money

06:24.178 --> 06:26.170
in case he has to
take the bus.

06:27.777 --> 06:28.700
Alan Moore,

06:28.715 --> 06:31.702
you wrote my favorite
issues of Radioactive Man.

06:31.866 --> 06:32.880
Oh, really.

06:32.886 --> 06:34.503
So you'd like that I made your

06:34.605 --> 06:37.030
favorite superhero a heroin-addicted

06:37.036 --> 06:39.640
jazz critic who's not radioactive?

06:39.658 --> 06:40.690
I don't read the words.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.372
I just like when he
punches people.

06:42.371 --> 06:44.944
How do you make his costume
stick so close this muscles?

06:46.592 --> 06:47.853
Mr. Moore,

06:47.869 --> 06:51.302
will you sign my DVD of Watchmen Babies?

06:51.308 --> 06:53.823
Which of the babies
is your favorite?

06:53.838 --> 06:56.453
You see what those
bloody corporations do?

06:56.455 --> 06:59.050
They take your ideas and they suck them!

06:59.056 --> 07:01.541
Suck them like leeches
until they've gotten

07:01.547 --> 07:04.652
every last drop of the
marrow from your bones!

07:04.657 --> 07:05.690
Hey, Teacup,

07:05.696 --> 07:07.101
why don't you chill out?

07:08.277 --> 07:09.300
Very well.

07:11.595 --> 07:13.521
Oh, little Lulu,

07:13.527 --> 07:17.153
I love you-lu, just the same.

07:17.457 --> 07:18.532
Ah!

07:19.518 --> 07:22.432
Attention, comic book aficionados!

07:22.438 --> 07:24.752
This man is not one of us!

07:24.757 --> 07:27.330
He has a girlfriend!

07:27.338 --> 07:28.651
My name's Strawberry.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.572
My purse is a lunchbox.

07:30.677 --> 07:31.841
Now listen up,

07:31.848 --> 07:34.021
my wayward little fanboys.

07:34.035 --> 07:36.361
I have the most wonderful news.

07:36.366 --> 07:39.891
My store now sells ninja weapons.

07:40.678 --> 07:43.853
You would sell weapons
of the Orient to children?

07:44.057 --> 07:45.292
That is weak.

07:45.348 --> 07:46.902
Face the facts, has-been.

07:46.908 --> 07:48.142
This man is the comic book

07:48.147 --> 07:49.691
guy our town deserves.

07:49.695 --> 07:50.463
Very well,

07:50.537 --> 07:53.002
I guess the mature thing to do is...

07:59.927 --> 08:00.891
Oh, no!

08:00.898 --> 08:02.501
The store's in trouble!

08:02.507 --> 08:05.361
League of Extraordinary Freelancers,

08:05.405 --> 08:06.340
activate!

08:08.545 --> 08:10.340
Maus is in the house!

08:13.408 --> 08:15.280
How do ya like this punch line?

08:23.478 --> 08:26.063
Ooh, L.A!

08:26.227 --> 08:27.933
This could be the gym for me.

08:29.915 --> 08:31.980
You're gonna get so ripped here.

08:32.216 --> 08:34.472
We've got Tummy Tone with Sasha,

08:34.937 --> 08:36.772
Power Bounce with Zach D.,

08:37.125 --> 08:39.482
Zen Abs with Zach G.,

08:39.668 --> 08:43.061
and you've just gotta try
Mommy and Me kickboxing!

08:53.807 --> 08:56.600
Who thought walking
could be so difficult?

08:56.608 --> 08:57.792
Well, I'm sure everyone else

08:57.798 --> 08:59.442
is having trouble, too.

09:11.908 --> 09:14.882
Maybe I'll just hit the showers.

09:19.628 --> 09:21.822
Marge, you missed a spot.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.732
Oh, I wish there was a gym

09:26.748 --> 09:28.951
for us regular ladies.

09:40.685 --> 09:42.500
"Rules: no men,

09:42.505 --> 09:43.730
no cell phones,

09:43.737 --> 09:45.643
no mirrors, no shame."

09:45.648 --> 09:47.223
Marge, I wish you well,

09:47.238 --> 09:49.842
but why would women
want to go to a gym if

09:49.846 --> 09:53.482
there were no men there
watching them and judging them?

09:57.296 --> 09:58.973
We're gonna be rich!

09:58.977 --> 10:01.310
We can finally start a family!

10:01.316 --> 10:02.670
We have a family.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.210
A better one!

10:08.537 --> 10:10.442
Switch stations!

10:11.807 --> 10:13.480
I love this gym.

10:13.625 --> 10:14.733
Me, too!

10:14.737 --> 10:16.713
Finally, an exercise bike

10:16.715 --> 10:18.661
for women of a certain age

10:18.665 --> 10:19.963
Jurassic!

10:23.678 --> 10:26.851
Mom, every workout appointment
is booked up for months!

10:26.856 --> 10:29.442
We'll have to open a second Shapes.

10:29.446 --> 10:32.612
We just need to find a
vacant rental property.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.470
I can't believe the labor

10:39.477 --> 10:41.581
board is shutting me down!

10:41.588 --> 10:43.682
You lock your workers in
at night.

10:43.686 --> 10:47.470
It's so they can't tell their stories!

10:47.508 --> 10:49.463
Mr. Krusty came
to my village.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.200
He said he would marry me.

10:51.207 --> 10:52.193
No ring!

10:52.207 --> 10:54.162
Just fill apple
pies all day!

11:06.276 --> 11:08.582
Today's guest created
the women's-only gym

11:08.588 --> 11:11.343
that's taking the
tri-county area by storm:

11:11.355 --> 11:12.610
Marge...

11:12.617 --> 11:14.110
Simpson!

11:18.475 --> 11:21.412
Marge, I thank you for creating Shapes

11:21.416 --> 11:24.290
and, uh, my boyfriend thanks you, too.

11:26.588 --> 11:29.242
When is Straightman
gonna pop the question?

11:31.338 --> 11:33.923
You're all getting German cuckoo clocks!

11:33.938 --> 11:35.790
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.820
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

11:37.837 --> 11:39.750
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

11:39.755 --> 11:41.892
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

11:48.427 --> 11:49.841
Oh, yeah, Marge,

11:49.848 --> 11:52.432
I love these business
trips of yours.

11:53.265 --> 11:56.110
The TV remote isn't nailed on!

11:56.117 --> 11:57.690
My whole life, I've never been

11:57.695 --> 11:59.842
in a hotel that trusted me.

12:08.305 --> 12:09.483
Hors d'oeuvres,

12:09.487 --> 12:10.732
big fancy desserts...

12:10.748 --> 12:13.141
and my wife is paying
for everything.

12:13.148 --> 12:15.952
Now I know why pimps are so happy.

12:15.956 --> 12:18.882
Yep, nothing beats
living on "wife-support."

12:19.708 --> 12:21.040
I hear that.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.313
Yo guys, come meet a new husband!

12:24.316 --> 12:25.402
Hey, how ya doin'?

12:25.406 --> 12:26.212
I'm Homer.

12:26.215 --> 12:28.092
My wife invented a gym for

12:28.096 --> 12:29.852
"regular" women.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.452
My wife invented

12:31.456 --> 12:34.173
"Skipills", she mixed
vitamins with Alka-Seltzer

12:34.175 --> 12:35.402
and pretended it was medicine.

12:35.405 --> 12:37.290
I pay ten dollars a tube for those!

12:37.297 --> 12:38.780
That's why I drive a Bentley.

12:38.786 --> 12:41.252
Yeah, I haven't decided
what kind of new car to get.

12:41.257 --> 12:42.772
Well, you'd better
decide soon.

12:42.787 --> 12:45.883
'Cause I have a feeling your wife
will also be getting a "new model."

12:45.887 --> 12:47.800
Yeah, she'll be "trading up."

12:47.816 --> 12:49.552
And they're not
talking about cars.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.760
Are you sure they're
not talking about cars?

12:52.767 --> 12:54.332
Because those are car words.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.561
Homer, we're all
second husbands.

12:56.566 --> 12:57.813
As soon as our wives hit it big,

12:57.815 --> 13:00.542
they dumped the fat old guys
they were with and married us.

13:00.835 --> 13:01.691
- Yes!
- Yes!

13:02.557 --> 13:04.080
Marge won't dump me.

13:04.088 --> 13:06.431
I'm the anchor that
keeps her weighed down.

13:07.685 --> 13:08.780
Here's how it starts:

13:08.787 --> 13:10.243
she gets a total makeover,

13:10.246 --> 13:12.060
and she starts wearing
fancy new clothes.

13:12.066 --> 13:13.310
Then she stops wanting to

13:13.317 --> 13:14.663
tell you about her day.

13:14.985 --> 13:15.470
Wha...?

13:15.478 --> 13:17.803
Here's how you know
she's really about to go:

13:17.806 --> 13:19.341
your wife seems happy

13:19.348 --> 13:20.543
and full of life.

13:20.548 --> 13:22.430
That will never happen!

13:24.456 --> 13:25.333
Marge!

13:25.335 --> 13:26.231
Marge!

13:29.766 --> 13:30.893
A makeover!

13:30.897 --> 13:31.861
Oh, my God!

13:31.865 --> 13:34.070
The prophecy
is being fulfilled.

13:37.087 --> 13:37.583
so,

13:37.588 --> 13:39.060
tell me about your day.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.383
Oh, you don't want
to hear about

13:40.385 --> 13:42.090
my boring old day.

13:42.098 --> 13:43.260
I do! I do!

13:43.265 --> 13:46.302
Well, the first inspirational
speech of the day

13:46.308 --> 13:48.723
was by the woman who
climbed Mount Everest and

13:48.728 --> 13:50.450
got everyone else killed.

13:50.547 --> 13:52.340
Hey, the networks
have different

13:52.346 --> 13:53.531
channels in this city.

13:53.538 --> 13:54.323
That's okay.

13:54.327 --> 13:55.911
I don't care that
you don't care.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.053
Go watch your thing.

13:59.457 --> 14:02.000
Are you happy and
full of life?

14:02.005 --> 14:03.933
I sure am!

14:19.737 --> 14:21.521
Marge, now that
you're rich,

14:21.526 --> 14:23.951
you really should get rid of that bag.

14:25.095 --> 14:25.923
Really?

14:25.928 --> 14:28.173
But I'm so used to my old one.

14:28.177 --> 14:29.113
Old one?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.400
They're convincing Marge to dump me!

14:31.408 --> 14:32.620
Oh, it's easy.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.233
I get a new one
every two years.

14:34.238 --> 14:34.992
From Italy!

14:35.008 --> 14:37.773
You would love
a big black one.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.812
Marge, get away
from them!

14:40.886 --> 14:42.271
What's gotten
into you?

14:42.335 --> 14:45.612
I'm going to the successful ladies room!

14:49.458 --> 14:50.762
You guys got
to help me!

14:50.767 --> 14:51.713
If Marge leaves,

14:51.717 --> 14:54.191
I'll have nothing except my many friends

14:54.198 --> 14:56.692
and half the fortune she is now making

14:56.698 --> 14:58.513
and will continue to make.

14:58.518 --> 15:00.502
Homer, I'm going to
let you in on a secret.

15:00.515 --> 15:02.530
I am a first husband.

15:02.538 --> 15:03.982
I used to look like this.

15:04.538 --> 15:05.193
Huh?

15:05.368 --> 15:07.183
What's your secret?

15:07.188 --> 15:08.323
Oh, there's no secret.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.262
Just hard work....

15:09.268 --> 15:09.770
Uh-huh.

15:09.788 --> 15:11.323
...exercise two hours a day...

15:11.328 --> 15:11.940
Okay.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.580
...keep up with
the latest fashions...

15:13.596 --> 15:14.390
Fashions.

15:14.407 --> 15:16.782
...and of course, cut out all
the fatty foods and alcohol.

15:16.796 --> 15:17.792
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

15:17.798 --> 15:18.551
Got it.

15:18.556 --> 15:20.381
I know just what it'll

15:20.385 --> 15:22.321
take to hang on to Marge.

15:27.966 --> 15:29.963
Mr. Simpson, let me outline

15:29.967 --> 15:32.871
the gastric bypass surgery
procedure for you,

15:32.877 --> 15:33.411
okay?

15:33.415 --> 15:35.402
We put a band around your stomach

15:35.408 --> 15:37.730
so that no solid food may enter.

15:37.755 --> 15:40.071
You see, just like so.

15:40.376 --> 15:43.511
It's a very, very serious operation.

15:43.517 --> 15:46.393
You should only undergo
it as a last resort.

15:46.395 --> 15:48.030
Please, Doc. I know I'm not

15:48.038 --> 15:49.461
the greatest-looking guy in the world,

15:49.467 --> 15:51.001
but I took care of my family,

15:51.008 --> 15:52.471
and that used to be enough.

15:52.486 --> 15:54.200
But not anymore.

15:54.636 --> 15:55.360
Very well.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.003
If you wish,
we can perform the

15:57.005 --> 15:58.500
procedure in the office today.

15:58.508 --> 16:01.010
And I know how I can knock myself out.

16:01.015 --> 16:02.840
I'll look at your bill.

16:03.738 --> 16:05.440
I guess, considering all the training

16:05.457 --> 16:07.492
you've received,
this is quite reasonable.

16:07.496 --> 16:09.380
I've never seen anything

16:09.386 --> 16:10.623
so reasonable!

16:10.627 --> 16:13.540
It's the bargain of a lifetime!

16:13.547 --> 16:14.073
And...

16:16.216 --> 16:17.821
Dad, are you okay?

16:17.926 --> 16:21.330
I see food on your plate
instead of blurring motions.

16:21.335 --> 16:22.113
Kids,

16:22.198 --> 16:24.953
your daddy underwent a special procedure

16:24.956 --> 16:27.632
so he can be more
attractiveto your mother.

16:27.635 --> 16:29.221
You had your hot dog plumped?

16:29.316 --> 16:31.032
No, I had my stomach stapled!

16:51.836 --> 16:54.813
All food tastes like barf now.

16:56.878 --> 16:58.932
Homie, I'm back!

17:03.076 --> 17:05.401
Welcome home, Marge.

17:05.406 --> 17:08.483
You remembered I like romance!

17:08.487 --> 17:10.280
A smart successful woman like

17:10.295 --> 17:12.491
you deserves the very best.

17:12.494 --> 17:15.231
You also remembered I like flattery!

17:15.234 --> 17:17.340
Do you like guys who are...

17:17.348 --> 17:19.093
attractive?

17:19.107 --> 17:22.111
Homie, you look good!

17:22.117 --> 17:23.940
All for you, baby.

17:23.945 --> 17:25.891
Let me get a good
look at you!

17:27.166 --> 17:28.761
Slow down, sexy beast.

17:28.768 --> 17:30.343
Why don't you take some time

17:30.345 --> 17:31.692
to savor the front?

17:31.696 --> 17:33.303
What are you hiding from me?

17:33.307 --> 17:34.600
Is it chocolate?

17:34.608 --> 17:36.203
Uh, it used to be.

17:37.396 --> 17:39.892
Those buns are poppin' fresh!

17:39.895 --> 17:41.971
Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the light now.

17:43.836 --> 17:45.941
And I'll just fold
this old sweaty blanket

17:45.947 --> 17:47.520
and put it in the closet.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.633
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:51.627 --> 17:54.611
Doctor, I'm embarrassed
to show my body to my wife,

17:54.616 --> 17:56.760
and it's all because of your surgery!

17:56.767 --> 17:59.011
You want me to unstaple your stomach?

17:59.545 --> 17:59.980
No,

18:00.057 --> 18:01.522
I want you to give me

18:01.525 --> 18:03.200
every other surgery you have

18:03.205 --> 18:04.393
so I can look good!

18:04.397 --> 18:06.920
And can you call it an
aortic valve replacement

18:06.926 --> 18:08.193
so my insurance will cover it?

18:08.196 --> 18:09.201
No problem.

18:10.267 --> 18:11.032
Okay.

18:11.037 --> 18:12.853
Count backwards from ten.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.333
Fine, I admit it.

18:14.337 --> 18:15.691
I'm drunk!

18:20.065 --> 18:22.313
And so, to honor her success,

18:22.327 --> 18:24.143
I bestow upon Marge Simpson

18:24.145 --> 18:25.782
this $100 gift card

18:25.785 --> 18:27.943
to Sweatpants Etcetera.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.671
Did someone order a super stud?

18:33.365 --> 18:35.453
My implants feel itchy.

18:35.455 --> 18:37.610
Yes, I was out of silicone rubber.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.560
so I used rolled-up socks.

18:42.468 --> 18:43.833
He's a monster!

18:43.835 --> 18:45.611
Pitchforks, everyone.

18:45.816 --> 18:47.121
Monster!

18:47.128 --> 18:48.391
Monster!

18:48.395 --> 18:49.542
Monster!

18:49.605 --> 18:51.003
Monster!

18:54.338 --> 18:56.061
Cut his heart out!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.182
Different from us!

19:03.215 --> 19:04.643
Different from us!

19:04.857 --> 19:05.263
Different...

19:05.267 --> 19:06.100
Listen, Homer,

19:06.105 --> 19:08.083
I got to be honest with you.

19:08.086 --> 19:09.941
You'd better not make me cry,

19:09.946 --> 19:12.373
'cause I don't know where
my tear ducts are anymore.

19:12.388 --> 19:14.460
I appreciate you trying
to become more

19:14.468 --> 19:17.003
attractivefor me, but the truth is,

19:17.006 --> 19:20.282
I'm way too successful for you now.

19:20.288 --> 19:22.891
I'm getting me a trophy husband!

19:26.896 --> 19:29.862
I don't want to live without you, Marge.

19:29.866 --> 19:30.680
Okay.

19:31.678 --> 19:32.780
No!

19:37.306 --> 19:38.071
What...?

19:39.315 --> 19:41.200
Why do I look like me again?

19:41.217 --> 19:44.833
The doctor called me about all
the crazy surgeries you wanted,

19:44.836 --> 19:46.493
and I said no.

19:46.496 --> 19:48.611
But I did have him unstaple your stomach

19:48.616 --> 19:51.941
and turn you back into
the sweet man I love.

19:51.947 --> 19:53.233
Then it was all a dream?

19:53.248 --> 19:55.783
I never became a hideous monster?

19:55.788 --> 19:57.652
The only person who
thinks you're a monster

19:57.658 --> 19:59.672
is the one who had to
give you a sponge bath.

20:01.318 --> 20:03.940
And Dad, I hope you
learned something from this.

20:03.945 --> 20:05.190
I sure have.

20:05.195 --> 20:07.401
Plastic surgery is a mistake,

20:07.406 --> 20:10.372
because it hasn't been perfected
to where you look really good.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.962
When it is, everyone should get it.

20:12.975 --> 20:14.123
Amen.

20:16.745 --> 20:17.813
Listen, Marge,

20:17.818 --> 20:19.942
I've been wondering all these years,

20:19.946 --> 20:23.081
why is it about me that
you find so irresistible?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.331
Let's face it

20:24.335 --> 20:25.692
you could do better.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.421
Well, maybe I could.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.430
But every time I look at you,

20:29.436 --> 20:33.282
I see the same adorable
boyI fell in love with.

20:35.216 --> 20:38.483
Well, there's nothing
like a happy ending.

20:38.486 --> 20:40.013
Holy heavens!

20:40.015 --> 20:42.851
Is that a meteor heading for the Earth?

20:42.858 --> 20:43.700
Maybe.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.313
But tonight there's a benefit
for underpaid comic book

20:46.327 --> 20:48.193
artists of the forties and fifties.

20:48.197 --> 20:50.171
To the cash bar!

20:57.848 --> 20:59.552
<i>Hanyong, pussycat?</i>

20:59.557 --> 21:01.580
<i>Wah, wah, wah-ah...</i>
