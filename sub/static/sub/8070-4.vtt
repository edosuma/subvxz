[music playing]

00:59.660 --> 01:00.528
No, come on.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.430
You're wide open.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.297
Come on.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.298
Don't just stand there.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.299
Shoot the ball.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.200
Shoot it.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.034
Shoot it.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.237
Shoot it it's up!

01:09.270 --> 01:10.638
Uh I was watching that.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.740
Well, now you're
watching this.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.343
Give me that.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.645
Hey, there is no
way I'm going to be

01:17.678 --> 01:18.946
watching Italian basketball.

01:21.014 --> 01:21.882
Ooh, look.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.217
It's the spokes model category.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.051
Yay.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.226
Becky, I can't see.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.361
Oh I'm sorry, Darlene.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.662
Am I in your way?

01:34.695 --> 01:38.098
Well, we got a 19 inch TV
and you got a 25 inch butt.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.237
Well, guess we're just going
to have to watch my show.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.005
Well, guess I'm just
going to have to tell

01:45.038 --> 01:47.074
Mom that I was watching first.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.041
[laughing]

01:48.075 --> 01:49.810
You're such a little infant.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.078
You're a PEZ head.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.180
Hey, babe.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.881
How long have they
been fighting like this?

01:53.914 --> 01:56.750
Well, let's see,
Darlene's almost 14 now.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.552
[telephone ringing]

01:59.620 --> 02:00.454
Hello.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.422
Mother.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.492
She was watching it first.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.360
Yeah.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.795
I'd love to.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.129
Friday night?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.331
Yeah, I was hoping you'd call.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.966
You want to buy me dinner?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.070
Well, gee, what's in it for you?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.038
Oh sure, I put out.

02:18.071 --> 02:18.872
Everybody knows that.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.710
Darlene, what are you doing?

02:22.743 --> 02:23.677
Oh, don't worry Mom.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.379
He thinks it's Becky.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.215
Oh, OK.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
Mother!

02:28.616 --> 02:29.783
I'm going to kill you Darlene.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.719
Hey, Kelly, I'll
see it on video.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.853
Sorry got to go.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.954
7:30.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.855
Don't dress.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.089
You're dead.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.425
[laughing]

02:37.458 --> 02:39.393
Now, you guys have been on
each other's case for weeks.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.294
Give it a rest.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.629
Mother, she was the one--

02:41.662 --> 02:43.264
And so did you.
Now go on.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.164
Find something to do.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.065
Go on.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.099
Go on.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.268
And stop calling me mother.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.606
Well, thanks for your help.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.974
What?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.344
Don't you have anything to
say about what Darlene just did?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.778
Yes.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.581
If only she'd use her power
for good instead of evil.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.482
[laughing]

03:04.552 --> 03:07.154
The thermostat's fixed.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.323
You just turn this
little doodad here.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.992
The heat goes on in the
basement and it's ready for you

03:12.025 --> 03:13.994
to resume your writing career.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.496
Well, you know,
I don't think I'm

03:15.529 --> 03:17.698
going to have that much
time to pursue that career,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.867
now what with the
new job I got today.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.901
Did you get that waitress job?

03:20.934 --> 03:21.802
Yes, I did.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.203
Well, it was close.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.173
It was between me and the
other woman they hired.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.842
Well, it beats sweeping
up at that beauty parlor.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.379
Well, the way I look at it,
I'm still working with hair,

03:31.412 --> 03:34.515
only now, it's in the food.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.849
Come here woman.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.851
You done good.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.889
Well, good then, you must
massage my feet now, nave.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.357
[chuckling]

03:43.391 --> 03:45.559
And a dainty pair
of pups they are.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.231
You know, I'm going to be
working the dinner shift.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.033
So that means you're going
to take over around here.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.735
Don't worry.
I can handle it.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.204
Yeah, well, you know,
that means that you've

03:57.237 --> 03:59.307
got to feed the kids
once in a while,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.675
you've got to maintain
law and order around here,

04:01.709 --> 04:05.813
and you have to keep them
from killing each other.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.647
Better write this down.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.619
Mom, Darlene's
hogging the bathroom.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.853
She's doing her
homework in there.

04:12.886 --> 04:13.754
And she locked me out.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.088
And I really need to get in.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.691
Darlene's doing her homework.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.226
Oh, honey.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.462
Oh it's a proud, proud day.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.098
You want to handle this, Dan?

04:25.132 --> 04:26.133
Nope.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.301
You start your job tomorrow.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.502
I start my job tomorrow.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.706
You got a job?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.074
Yeah.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.577
I'm working in the restaurant
over at Rodbell's department

04:36.610 --> 04:38.846
store.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.981
The-- the one in the mall?

04:41.014 --> 04:41.915
Yeah.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.752
Where I hang out
with my friends?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.554
Yeah.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.122
My mother is
going to be there.

04:49.156 --> 04:52.726
Yeah, it's a kick
in the head, ain't it?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.195
You've ruined my life?

04:55.228 --> 04:58.599
Well, you don't think I took
the job for the money, do you?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.001
[music playing]

05:06.039 --> 05:08.409
[chattering]

05:10.978 --> 05:11.912
You guys behave!

05:23.691 --> 05:26.594
Can I help you.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.495
Um, yeah--

05:27.528 --> 05:28.896
Hey!

05:28.929 --> 05:30.163
Just have a seat anywhere ma'am.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.099
Look, you guys quit
flipping them spoons.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.536
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.370
That'd be great.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.874
Um, you know, I uh--

05:40.908 --> 05:41.775
Um there's no cream.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.743
Um, there's some in the back.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.812
I'll be back in just a second.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.680
Well I've had worse jobs.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.387
Spoon.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.221
Spoon.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.061
[laughing]

06:01.094 --> 06:03.063
Here yo go.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.565
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.400
Would you please do
something about those kids.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.801
They're throwing
spitballs at my wife.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.202
Yes sir.
I'm sorry.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.237
I'll take care of it.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.005
I'll be right back.

06:12.039 --> 06:12.973
Look.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.042
You guys have got
to cut this out, OK?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.244
Yeah, right.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.446
I'm sorry, sir.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.413
I'm sorry.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.313
I'm sorry.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.449
I'm sorry.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.551
You know, you look like
you could use some help.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.118
Well, this is the
first day on the job.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.754
And there's supposed to
be another waitress here.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.955
But she hasn't gotten here yet.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.723
Oh, that's a shame.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.558
Wait a minute.

06:32.159 --> 06:32.960
Tada!

06:36.664 --> 06:38.666
We look like we were
separated at birth.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.837
That's your table, sis.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.939
Jeez, they're kind
of cute, aren't they?

06:45.973 --> 06:48.241
You know, I have a couple
kids at home, just their age.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.543
I think I can relate to them.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.952
Get out!

06:58.986 --> 07:01.354
[applause]

07:03.924 --> 07:06.293
[music playing]

07:11.832 --> 07:14.034
Roseanne, you know
when our dinner break is?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.268
I'm starving.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.304
Gee, I'm not hungry at all.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.672
I wonder why.

07:24.978 --> 07:29.783
Mmkay, I've got a Salisbury
steak, and a sauce steak.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.552
Who gets the Salisbury steak?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.353
- Uh, I do.
- OK.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.088
Then you would be
the person to ask.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.425
Um, which one is it?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.827
Roseanne!

07:39.860 --> 07:41.629
Roseanne!

07:41.662 --> 07:45.633
Enjoy your, uh, thing.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.202
Roseanne, we're out of decaf
and I can't find anymore.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.806
Oh, well, see, you just
don't know where to look.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.042
[laughing]

07:56.009 --> 07:56.877
There.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.080
Now you're out of regular.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.082
Hey, hi Becky.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.052
How you doing honey?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
(WHISPERED) Come on, come on.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.226
Mother, would it be all
right if that other woman

08:13.260 --> 08:14.161
waited on us?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.062
No.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.329
For one thing, she's busy.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.398
And for another, y'all are
just going to sit there

08:18.431 --> 08:19.667
sipping sodas for an hour.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.769
And then you'll leave her,
like, a quarter for a tip.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.503
Miss, I'm waiting here.

08:23.537 --> 08:27.207
Well, just a minute all right?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.776
Just go have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.810
All right.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.344
But do me a favor
and don't come over

08:31.378 --> 08:33.914
and start acting like you're
my mother or something, OK?

08:33.947 --> 08:34.948
So what?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.150
Then like's
breastfeeding you is out.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.986
[laughing]

08:41.488 --> 08:44.157
Oh god.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.092
Miss.

08:45.125 --> 08:45.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.432
Mmkay, you ready to order?

08:52.465 --> 08:55.002
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a glass of water.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.007
You're not going
to order any food?

09:00.040 --> 09:00.908
Nope.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.110
This ain't my table.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.045
You want me to wait
on your daughter?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.279
She looks kind of embarrassed.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.216
Yeah, I'm real
worried about it.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.619
Hi girls, how are you doing?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.486
You know, this
is really weird,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.823
Mrs. Conner, you serving
us and everything.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.424
Yeah, well, just
pretend like, you know,

09:17.457 --> 09:19.326
it's over at our house.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.161
Of course, here they
make me wash my hands

09:21.194 --> 09:23.263
before I serve you the food.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.565
[laughing]

09:25.599 --> 09:28.001
Mother, that's gross.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.903
She's just kidding, you guys.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.171
Well, duh, Becky.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.640
Lighten up, Beck.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.874
Yeah, lighten up, Beck.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.143
Duh.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.645
Can we just order now?

09:37.678 --> 09:38.545
Shoot.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.613
OK.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.082
I'll have a cheese
burger, and fries, and--

09:42.115 --> 09:43.951
How come you're
even here eating?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.719
I mean, your dad's supposed
must be cooking for your.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.887
Dad said it's OK.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.488
Besides, he's only
going to order

09:48.521 --> 09:49.990
a pizza at halftime anyway.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.559
Well, I left the meatloaf
in the fridge this morning.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.527
Well, I guess he
changed his mind.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.763
Really?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.497
Well, could we,
like, order now.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.398
Uh, yeah.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.934
You'll eat what I bring you.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.837
Just like him sitting up there
on his butt, watching the game,

10:03.871 --> 10:05.806
while I kill myself
making a meat loaf.

10:05.839 --> 10:09.609
And this time I even
put real meat in it.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.584
BECKY: Give it back.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.086
Hey, give that back!

10:19.119 --> 10:20.053
DARLENE: Make me!

10:20.087 --> 10:21.054
BECKY: Give it back!

10:21.088 --> 10:23.556
Hey, it was on my
side of the room!

10:23.590 --> 10:26.026
DARLENE: Well, I don't
even want it in the room.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.027
BECKY: OK.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.528
Let go!

[suspenseful music playing]

10:31.564 --> 10:33.000
BECKY: That's my sweater.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.936
Yeah, well, let's see if it fly!

10:35.969 --> 10:38.939
DARLENE: You scum!

10:38.972 --> 10:41.909
Dad, look.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.911
[laughing]

10:43.944 --> 10:46.947
Oh, there's something
you don't see every day.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.848
No, no, no.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.916
Darlene, come on.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.283
That was my favorite!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.752
Like I care.

11:01.628 --> 11:05.699
Becky, you drop that
thing and you're dead.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.034
Oops.

11:07.067 --> 11:07.935
You dropped it.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.036
Now go get it.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.037
Ow!

11:10.070 --> 11:10.938
Hey!

Hey!

Break.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.708
[groaning]

11:14.742 --> 11:15.642
All right.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.444
What's going on?
- Dad, look--

11:17.477 --> 11:18.779
I can't live with
her anymore, OK?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.280
She's always getting
her stuff in my stuff.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.681
You know what?
I don't care.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.615
You two can't live together?

11:22.649 --> 11:23.516
Fine.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.885
You don't have to.

11:24.918 --> 11:28.255
Darlene, get your stuff, you're
moving down to the basement.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.156
What?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.057
Are you kidding?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.892
I mean, I'm sick of this.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.593
You two do nothing but fight.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.929
You're just going to have
to learn how to live apart.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.498
What do you think about that?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.399
You're the best dad.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.233
I'll get my stuff.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.205
And hurry it up.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.814
DJ, go clean up your room.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.714
Why?

11:54.748 --> 11:55.548
I'm on a roll.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.320
I ought to get more kids.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.225
Hello, dear.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.828
Welcome to Conner Manor
where the children are fed,

12:07.861 --> 12:11.531
the dishes are washed,
and all is serene.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.266
And the bras
and the underpants

12:13.300 --> 12:15.803
are all over the front yard.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.006
You know, most people
would have opted for, like,

12:19.039 --> 12:20.640
a pink flamingo.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.541
Ah, that.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.876
A minor skirmish.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.445
I'll have the girls
take care of it.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.247
Though I hear you totally
humiliated Becky at the mall

12:27.280 --> 12:28.148
today.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.482
Yeah.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.584
You know, I think this job's
going to work out swell.

12:34.321 --> 12:38.658
By the way, what was Becky
doing at the mall anyhow?

12:38.691 --> 12:40.260
She didn't want pizza?

12:40.293 --> 12:41.328
Well what about that meatloaf?

12:41.361 --> 12:44.331
Nobody wanted meatloaf.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.532
Couldn't give that stuff away.

12:48.668 --> 12:49.903
Where are you going
with that stuff?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.404
Well, I can't live
with Becky anymore

12:51.438 --> 12:53.006
so I'm moving down
to the basement.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.574
Whose stupid idea is that?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.408
Mine.

12:57.677 --> 12:58.578
I'll straighten this out.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.547
I already straightened it out.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.815
The girls wouldn't
stop fighting.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.483
I took care of it.
- By what?

13:03.516 --> 13:04.417
Separating them?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.552
I never would have
done that, Dan.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.454
Well, you weren't here.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.755
You told me to
take charge, I did.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.722
What are you going to do?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.191
Come in and overrule
everything I do?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.660
Well, now they're never going
to talk to each other again.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.494
Honey.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.002
How can you just lay there
like that and stare at the TV?

13:22.035 --> 13:22.903
Easy.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.038
It was quiet

13:26.039 --> 13:26.907
till you got home.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.245
[music playing]

13:39.052 --> 13:39.953
I don't know.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.221
I think Dan had a good idea.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.422
When we were kids
it would have been

13:42.455 --> 13:44.157
great having our own rooms.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.327
I don't think we would be this
close if we'd been separated.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.496
And besides, we had a lot
of fun sharing that room.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.397
Fun?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.798
It was awful.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.368
You used to pour warm water on
my blanket when I was sleeping.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.105
I thought I was a
bed-wetter till I was 12.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.607
Well, you were no
perfect sister anyways.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.775
You used to lock the door
when I'd stay out late.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.311
Then I'd have to come
home and ring the bell.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.445
And then Daddy would get up.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.580
And he'd, like, to talk to me.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.149
You started that rumor
I liked Ronnie Addison.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.784
Well, you did
like Ronny Addison.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.685
I did not.

14:12.719 --> 14:13.586
Yes you did.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.454
You're such a liar!

14:14.487 --> 14:16.623
It was written
all over your diary.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.926
Ronny Addison, he's so
cute, I just love him.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.826
He's so hot.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.561
You read my diary?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.196
No.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.497
You ready my diary.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.332
I have to work.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.602
Mom, I need your
employee discount card.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.171
Well, I'm trying
to work now, Darlene.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.040
Just give me a minute.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.910
Jackie, can I
borrow a credit card?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.011
What for?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.480
Well, I saw this great
stereo system, right?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.449
It's $1,000.

14:42.482 --> 14:46.686
So I use mom's ID, get 20%
off, then return it full price.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.321
I do that 5 times
and I can afford

14:48.355 --> 14:51.524
the stereo system for real.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.327
Not bad, huh?

14:54.361 --> 14:57.064
Darlene, that's illegal.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.131
How would you know?

14:58.165 --> 14:59.066
What?

14:59.099 --> 15:02.469
Am I sitting here
in a clown suit?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.371
Forget about it Darlene.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.139
Run along.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.341
I'm always going to be poor.

15:08.375 --> 15:13.280
Now, she'd need a
receipt for that, right?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.647
See.
There you go.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.548
See?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.916
See what?

15:16.950 --> 15:19.953
Darlene just walked right
by Becky, didn't say nothing.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.388
So she just walked by her.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.722
What's the big deal.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.892
Because normally when she'd
walk by she'd look at Becky,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.060
and she'd go, hi, geek and.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.329
Then Becky would go
drop dead, butch.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.531
You know, they'd
have a relationship.

15:31.564 --> 15:35.102
Roseanne, did you ever
wonder that maybe what's really

15:35.135 --> 15:38.205
bugging you here is
that Dan decided to put

15:38.238 --> 15:41.508
him in separate rooms, not you.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.409
That is ridiculous.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.710
No!
No, no.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.744
No.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.646
I think I might be
onto something here.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.049
Somebody else is calling
the shots on your turf

15:49.082 --> 15:50.850
and you don't like.

15:50.883 --> 15:51.751
Damn.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.253
Just may make detective yet.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.993
And you also may be the
first cop in history to ever

16:00.027 --> 16:01.094
pay for a cup of coffee.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.066
You're hopeless, Roseanne.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.467
Well, what am
I supposed to do?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.901
Just let everything
go to hell and let

16:08.935 --> 16:10.237
Dan do whatever he wants?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.005
Do you trust Dan?

16:12.039 --> 16:14.407
Do I have to?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.443
Well, you just got to let
him do what he thinks is right.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.046
OK, but like, what
if I just, you know--

16:19.079 --> 16:22.582
Look, you asked him to take
over so just let him do it.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.751
Let somebody else do it.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.652
I can't.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.354
That's because
you think you always

16:27.387 --> 16:30.023
have to be the strong one.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.724
I don't know how to be weak.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.629
Wait a minute.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.231
You're weak.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.134
Teach me.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.536
[music playing]

16:48.007 --> 16:48.941
Hi, babe.

16:48.975 --> 16:49.909
Hi.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.178
Hey, Mom.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.545
What's he doing up?

16:52.579 --> 16:53.880
We made a deal.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.249
DJ did the dishes, and I'm
letting him stay up a little.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.284
A deal?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.186
Let's go make some
coffee, Roseanne.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.753
He let DJ stay up late.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.954
Then it's going to
be, like, totally

17:01.988 --> 17:03.556
impossible for me to get
him up in the morning,

17:03.590 --> 17:04.491
and send him to school.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.592
That's going to
ruin my whole day.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.260
It'll be OK.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.661
And look at this.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.130
Why would he let
DJ do the dishes?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.164
It's covered with filth.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.065
Why would he do that?

17:12.099 --> 17:13.233
Breathe.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.534
OK.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.236
Roseanne, I know
the dishes are a mess.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.570
I was just waiting
for DJ to go to bed.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.471
I'll do them.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.839
See?

17:19.872 --> 17:23.042
Now, Dan, if DJ promised you
that he would do the dishes,

17:23.076 --> 17:24.677
what is he ever going to
learn if his father goes

17:24.711 --> 17:27.046
and does everything for him.
My god.

17:27.080 --> 17:27.980
Oh my god.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.716
Breathe.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.617
You breathe.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.551
I wanna go do the dishes.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.020
Roseanne, let him do it.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.258
Give them the power
over the dishes.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.793
But he does a lousy
job on the dishes.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.795
You do a lousy
job on the dishes.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.897
Yeah, but he's
going to leave spots.

17:44.931 --> 17:45.898
Roseanne, this is it.

17:45.932 --> 17:46.966
You're going to go in there.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.368
You're going to watch
Dan do the dishes.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.969
And you're not going
to do anything.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.171
You understand?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.346
Honey you want me to dry?

Nah, thanks.

them in the rack to air dry.

the extra blankets.

I'm trying to do my math.

It's freezing down there.

because you were cold, did you?

18:25.071 --> 18:26.473
Yeah, I did.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.875
I think you're just
using that as an excuse

18:28.908 --> 18:31.578
to go back to your old
room, isn't that true?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.713
No.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.148
Are you making me move back?

18:35.182 --> 18:38.918
I am just over here
breathing with Aunt Jackie?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.853
Darlene, Girl you can
stay in the basement as

18:40.887 --> 18:43.790
long as you want, if you want.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.459
Well, it's kind of,
like, lonely down there.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.495
And I would move back
upstairs, but Becky's just

18:48.528 --> 18:50.797
going to say it's her room and
I'm moving back because I miss

18:50.830 --> 18:52.699
her, and need her, and dweeb,
dweeb, dweeb, dweeb, dweeb,

18:52.732 --> 18:53.533
dweeb, dweeb.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.738
I'll tell you what, why
don't you blame it on me?

18:58.771 --> 19:01.408
Tell her I said the
basement was too cold.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.309
All right.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.210
Thanks Dad.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.143
Anytime.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.144
Hey, Becky.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.479
Dad's making me move back.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.215
So get your crap off of my crap.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.786
Thank you, thank
you, no applause.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.422
Oh, yeah, right.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.957
Like you planned
she would get cold.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.493
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.795
She didn't come up here
because she was cold.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.298
The basement's heated.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.834
She just needed an excuse
to go back to her old room.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.302
I'm surprised you
didn't pick up on that.

19:29.336 --> 19:34.541
But then, not everyone can be as
perfect a parent as Dan Conner.

19:34.574 --> 19:38.110
Oh I'm truly humbled
by your magnificence.

19:38.144 --> 19:43.149
As am I. And you know, I
think I'll let these old dishes

19:43.182 --> 19:44.751
wait until the morning.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.620
Ladies.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.021
I'm amazed, Roseanne.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.122
You just stayed back.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.724
You let Dan handle that.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.625
Mm-hmm.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.593
May I do the dishes now?

19:53.626 --> 19:54.627
You've earned it.

19:54.661 --> 19:55.528
Thank you.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.473
Oh, say, sis.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.040
You might want to turn
the heat in the basement

20:08.074 --> 20:10.343
back up with that little
thermostat deal over there.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.649
You little sneak.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.486
Thank you, thank
you, no applause.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.453
[music playing]

20:20.487 --> 20:22.855
[applause]

20:26.893 --> 20:30.397
Yeah, but remember how you
taught me to put lipstick on?

20:30.430 --> 20:36.102
Not on the lips, around the lips
so it wouldn't smear when I got

20:36.135 --> 20:37.704
kissed.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.406
God you were stupid.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.574
I trusted you.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.843
Well you were no angelic
little sister yourself.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.177
What did I ever do to you?

20:45.211 --> 20:47.714
Oh, I start going out with
Dan and you go and tell him

20:47.747 --> 20:49.549
you're my daughter.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.850
[laughing]

20:50.883 --> 20:53.085
He was stupid.

20:53.119 --> 20:56.589
And what about your
imaginary sister?

20:56.623 --> 20:57.757
My imaginary sister?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.592
You made her up.

20:59.626 --> 21:03.663
Oh, yeah, well, if she
was my imaginary sister she

21:03.696 --> 21:05.197
was your imaginary sister too.

21:05.231 --> 21:08.735
Yeah, but she'd
only talk to you.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.404
That's because she
hated you, Jackie.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.839
Roseanne.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.874
It was all I
could do to keep her

21:14.907 --> 21:18.010
from killing you in your sleep.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.145
Just admit it.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.814
You were the rottenest
sister ever born.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.217
Well, I don't believe I have
to sit here and take that,

21:25.251 --> 21:26.285
and neither do you, Vanessa.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.923
Very funny.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.326
Now don't say that Vanessa,
you'll hurt hr feelings.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.895
She likes wearing
her hair like that.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.664
Just grow up, OK?

21:39.599 --> 21:40.400
Hey!

21:42.935 --> 21:44.270
What'd she say about my hair?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.405
[music playing]

21:46.406 --> 21:47.807
[applause]

21:53.913 --> 21:56.549
