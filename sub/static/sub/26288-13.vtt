00:05.744 --> 00:08.138
GIBBS:
I had a dream that I was her.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.406
I was trapped.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.585
I could not get out.

00:22.065 --> 00:25.025
Yet I believed
there would be a savior.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.161
To the very end, I believed.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.036
But sometimes
a savior never comes.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.636
Team Gibbs!

01:11.680 --> 01:13.073
Are! You!

01:13.116 --> 01:15.162
Ready! Ha!

01:15.205 --> 01:17.512
Happy morning,
and...

01:17.555 --> 01:19.557
Happy Random Day.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.038
Oh. Thank you.
What is this for?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.997
Oh. Instead of buying for people
on Christmas or birthdays,

01:25.041 --> 01:28.653
I choose one random date
each year to give gifts.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.090
Uh... why?

01:30.133 --> 01:31.700
What makes you
feel more special,

01:31.743 --> 01:33.180
getting anotherpresent

01:33.223 --> 01:34.703
when you're
already rakin' 'em in,

01:34.746 --> 01:36.052
or getting one...

01:36.096 --> 01:38.098
on a random Tuesday?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.404
My "Q" key!
Where'd you find this?

01:40.448 --> 01:42.058
I've been looking
for this...
For your vintage

01:42.102 --> 01:44.365
X28 Ryson typewriter.
Yeah, I know.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.714
You mentioned it in passing.

01:45.757 --> 01:46.715
McGEE:
Yeah.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.369
No... way!

01:48.412 --> 01:49.674
I've been
wanting a scarf

01:49.718 --> 01:51.937
that's not too thick
and not too thin.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.852
Yeah, I know.
You mentioned it in passing.

01:53.896 --> 01:56.420
Ooh, I can't wait to see
what I mentioned.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.515
What is this?

02:04.559 --> 02:05.690
It's a jar.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.563
Happy Random Day, everybody!

02:10.042 --> 02:11.653
You got a punching bag?

02:11.696 --> 02:15.657
Yeah, those punches I landed
at the Studio-Art Brawl of 2018

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
really got
my juices flowing.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.965
I mentioned in passing
I wanted to get one...KASIE: Yeah.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.359
It's secondhand,
but it's a beauty.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.666
You know, I think
I might take it home.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.798
I was gonna, uh,
leave it down in Autopsy,

02:26.842 --> 02:29.671
but can you imagine the glare
I would have gotten from Gibbs?

02:29.714 --> 02:32.064
Oh, you're getting
a pretty good one right now.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.327
Gibbs. What
terrible timing.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.937
I mean me,
my timing, not yours.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.418
Uh, let me
move this for you.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.723
Grab your gear!

02:38.767 --> 02:40.769
We have a situation
on base.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.553
Uh, hey, Gibbs.
Happy Random Day.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.774
I have a hunk of a tree strapped
to the top of my car for you.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.558
I found it by the
side of the road,

02:47.602 --> 02:48.820
and I thought you
could just woodwork

02:48.864 --> 02:50.170
the crap out of it.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.172
JIMMY: Well,
the back of him

02:52.215 --> 02:53.738
looked really excited.You think?

02:53.782 --> 02:55.218
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.438
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

02:57.481 --> 03:00.267
I'm telling you, I have
never seen her before.All right,

03:00.310 --> 03:02.530
we're gonna need you
to calm down.Are you gonna help or not?

03:02.573 --> 03:04.488
Just wait here.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.752
The guy says

03:07.796 --> 03:09.928
he found a young girl hiding
in his storage unit.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.626
She won't come out.He said

03:11.669 --> 03:12.931
she's terrified of him.
She's hiding

03:12.975 --> 03:14.150
behind some boxes in there.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.804
All right. Just make sure

03:15.847 --> 03:17.762
he's giving us
the whole story, huh?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.416
Bishop, with me.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.654
Hey there.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.440
My name is
Special Agent Gibbs.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.837
Do you know
where your parents are?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.801
She keeps looking at you.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.673
Give it a try.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.806
Okay.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.158
Hey.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.726
I'm Ellie.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.902
What's your name?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.688
Lily.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.342
Lily, huh?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.909
That's a really good name.

04:17.953 --> 04:20.303
Hey, where do you live, Lily?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.740
In the basement.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.525
In an apartment around here?

04:24.568 --> 04:26.440
Hey.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.528
You cold?

04:27.571 --> 04:29.399
Do you want to wear my coat?

04:31.096 --> 04:32.881
What's that?

04:32.924 --> 04:34.796
Oh.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.233
It's a jacket,
'cause...

04:37.277 --> 04:39.540
it...

04:39.583 --> 04:42.325
is way too cold

04:42.369 --> 04:44.327
to go outside
without it.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.592
I don't go outside.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.555
Hey, Lily...

04:54.598 --> 04:56.731
the basement
where you live,

04:56.774 --> 04:59.299
is this your first time
outside of it?

05:02.258 --> 05:05.348
He locks the door.

05:05.392 --> 05:09.091
Mommy tries to open it...

05:09.134 --> 05:11.920
but he always locks it.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.791
Your mom was
in the basement, too?

05:13.835 --> 05:16.141
She's still there.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.274
Where, Lily?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.885
Do you know how to get back
to where your mom is?

05:20.929 --> 05:22.496
No.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.932
Okay.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.601
Doctor says she's undernourished

05:40.644 --> 05:43.517
and highly susceptible
to illness.Spend your whole life

05:43.560 --> 05:45.649
locked in one room,
you have no immunity.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.435
Mm. They're gonna keep
her for a few more days,

05:48.478 --> 05:50.611
build her strength,
run some more tests.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.874
She say anything else
about where her mom is?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.137
SLOANE:
No. She's regressing
by the minute.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.445
The more overwhelmed she becomes
by this huge, foreign world,

05:58.488 --> 06:00.490
the more she
retreats-- plus,

06:00.534 --> 06:02.318
what the doctors
originally thought

06:02.362 --> 06:05.495
were bug bites on her arms
and legs were actually burns.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.630
I, uh, I could try
to talk to her again.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.327
That's not a bad idea.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.417
Lily's without the one person
in the world she trusts.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.637
Yeah. Her mother.Yes.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.203
And she defaults
to trusting women

06:18.247 --> 06:20.467
because of what she suffered
at the hands of a man.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.294
You think that you
can get her to talk?

06:22.338 --> 06:23.557
Gibbs...

06:23.600 --> 06:25.472
I already made
a connection with her.Bishop,

06:25.515 --> 06:28.170
that girl needs us in the field.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.521
Chase down every lead we can.
We find her mom. Come on.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.481
Okay.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.487
Update. Let's go.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.792
KASIE:
Incoming.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.490
We got ourselves
a DNA hit, people.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.144
I found a familial
match to Lily

06:46.188 --> 06:47.668
in the DoD database.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.799
You ID'd Lily's mother?Yep.

06:48.843 --> 06:51.019
She is Navy Seaman Recruit

06:51.062 --> 06:52.324
Morgan Burke.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.284
McGEE:
I remember her.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.417
She was reported missing,
what, eight years ago?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.027
Ten.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.726
Boss?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.598
Getting some air.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.426
Gibbs gets air?

07:06.469 --> 07:09.907
I've got the NCIS Report
of Investigation. "18-year-old

07:09.951 --> 07:12.301
"Morgan Burke was reported
missing by her mother.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.390
"Morgan had been
sworn into the Navy

07:14.434 --> 07:16.305
but never reported for duty."McGEE:
That's right.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.002
She hadn't really started
her service yet,

07:18.046 --> 07:20.918
so NCIS handed the case over
to the sheriff's office.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.877
I pulled up some
news articles from back then.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.009
According to her mother,
Morgan was pregnant at the time

07:25.053 --> 07:26.707
of her disappearance.McGEE:
Yeah, and then they

07:26.750 --> 07:28.230
found her body
in the car, right?

07:28.273 --> 07:30.014
Well, her car
had gone off a cliff,

07:30.058 --> 07:31.799
killing her.KASIE: It says
her remains

07:31.842 --> 07:33.540
were charred.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.151
What little DNA they pulled
was contaminated.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.240
They ruled it a suicide.Yeah, but if Morgan

07:38.283 --> 07:40.242
is still alive,
that's someone else's remains

07:40.285 --> 07:41.809
who were in that car.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.855
Well, and Morgan, she was
abducted when she was pregnant,

07:44.899 --> 07:47.031
and she had Lily
in captivity...

07:47.075 --> 07:50.774
She must have been held prisoner
in that basement ever since.

07:50.818 --> 07:54.212
Ten years.
The report says there's

07:54.256 --> 07:55.866
a continued file at the annex.Why do we have

07:55.910 --> 07:57.868
the continued file
when we handed over the case?

07:57.912 --> 07:59.348
I don't know.
But I'll check it out.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.567
I'll help.You know,

08:00.610 --> 08:02.090
Lily couldn't have
gotten that far

08:02.133 --> 08:03.918
from the basement on foot,
so I'm gonna start

08:03.961 --> 08:06.355
the search grid for Morgan
at a five-mile radius.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.748
MAN:
My name is

08:07.791 --> 08:08.923
Detective Paul Atwood.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.925
I headed up the investigation

08:10.968 --> 08:12.448
into Morgan Burke's
disappearance ten years ago.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.058
Why, Gibbs. Come on in.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.758
I was on a team that ruled this
a suicide at that time,

08:17.801 --> 08:21.718
and I take full responsibility
for that grave error.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.112
I will find Morgan,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.549
and I will bring her home.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.551
Don't say it.One thing they
had to do:

08:28.595 --> 08:30.292
keep it out of the press.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.120
I had to update
them, Gibbs.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.948
You can spin this
any way you want,

08:33.991 --> 08:36.472
but it was a Breen County
Sheriff's investigation.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.257
They went public with it
to try to save face on TV.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.694
I can't begin
to figure out

08:40.737 --> 08:42.434
what went on
in their heads, Gibbs.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.611
We never should have handed
this case off.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.308
Well, look at you.
Bringing up ten years ago?

08:46.351 --> 08:47.788
Yes, I am.Well, that's a new one.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.616
Usually the past
is nipping at your ass,

08:49.659 --> 08:51.922
and you're running
full steam ahead the other way.Morgan Burke

08:51.966 --> 08:53.794
was Navy-- that case
should have been ours.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.709
She hadn't served
a day yet.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.145
I approved that handoff.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.973
I followed protocol in doing so,

08:59.016 --> 09:01.584
and so did
everyone else involved.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.068
So... are we done talking
about this already?

09:07.111 --> 09:09.810
This case is ours now.At the very least,

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
the sheriff's office will want
to do a joint investigation,

09:11.855 --> 09:13.640
and I don't see them
walking away without a fight.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.642
Maybe not.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.774
But you're the bigger dog.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.389
Hey, did you see
what Kasie gave Vance

09:24.433 --> 09:26.522
for, uh, for that
Random Day thing?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.089
A pen.Huh.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.525
Who gives a pen as a gift?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.266
What are you so angry about?

09:31.309 --> 09:33.660
Because I never said
I wanted an empty jar.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.531
Everybody else got
something they wanted,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.925
and the director and I
got the shaft.

09:37.968 --> 09:41.232
I mean, why would... why would
Kasie play us like that, man?

09:41.276 --> 09:43.234
KM-216.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.888
Here it is.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.898
But look at all these dates.
They go all the way

09:54.942 --> 09:58.467
up to 2013-- that's years after
the police ruled this a suicide.

10:04.516 --> 10:07.432
"Ben Ramsey,
boyfriend of Morgan Burke."

10:08.259 --> 10:09.870
Look at all these.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.873
He was a suspect.Yeah.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.136
Whoever was investigating this
must have thought this was

10:15.179 --> 10:16.964
a murder, not a a suicide.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.488
Who was investigating?

10:26.016 --> 10:28.410
Oh, my God.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.325
What?

10:30.368 --> 10:34.111
Look at the reflection
in the window.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.810
You can see who's
taking the picture.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.160
BISHOP:
That's Ziva.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.032
Ziva David.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.087
Ellie. Ellie, wait.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.871
This is a bad idea.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.439
Look, if Ziva suspected Morgan's
boyfriend of murdering her,

10:57.482 --> 11:00.007
it's possible he abducted her
and we need to talk to him.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.530
No. I mean,
not telling anyone.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.140
You don't think McGee
would want to know

11:03.184 --> 11:04.576
that Ziva kept investigating
this thing? Gibbs?

11:04.620 --> 11:06.187
Okay, for whatever reason,
Ziva wanted to keep

11:06.230 --> 11:07.884
her investigation a secret
and I'm gonna honor that.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.365
Look, you're protecting someone
you haven't even met.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.671
And for what, Ellie?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
Ziva David is dead.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.152
And I wish she wasn't.

11:15.196 --> 11:18.286
Look... people are afraid to
talk about her in front of me

11:18.329 --> 11:20.288
because they think
I'll never measure up.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.246
That's not even the
part that gets me.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.335
What gets me is...
I feel cheated.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.860
Like there are things that
I could've learned from her

11:26.903 --> 11:28.731
that I couldn't get
from anyone else.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.778
Look, this touchy-feely stuff

11:31.821 --> 11:34.781
is... obviously not my thing.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.131
But not telling Gibbs,

11:37.174 --> 11:39.437
that's a bad idea.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.831
If you don't agree with it,
you can stay here.

11:50.622 --> 11:54.278
Listen, I have a deadline in,
uh, 33 minutes.

11:54.322 --> 11:58.239
And I could lose
this entire account, so, uh...

11:58.282 --> 12:00.720
is there any way
you could come back later?

12:02.286 --> 12:06.421
That's you, outside of the home
of Morgan Burke,

12:06.464 --> 12:07.770
two days after she went missing.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.076
What were you doing there?

12:09.119 --> 12:11.905
I was visiting her mother.

12:11.948 --> 12:14.559
Ziva David took these,
didn't she?

12:14.603 --> 12:16.779
How did you know that?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.781
Because she-she thought

12:18.825 --> 12:20.609
there was
some questionable things

12:20.652 --> 12:23.090
about Morgan's car going off
that cliff.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.787
She thought she was murdered.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.920
She thought you did it.

12:26.963 --> 12:29.661
I mean, she followed
me for-for months.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.403
She must've been like some
kind of ninja, but, uh,

12:32.447 --> 12:34.318
well, eventually,
she cleared me.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.103
And how do you know that?She told me.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.669
And she promised
to find the person

12:37.713 --> 12:39.454
that did this
to the mother of my child.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.891
You know that, right?
Morgan was pregnant...

12:41.935 --> 12:44.241
when she was killed.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.634
The baby was mine.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.723
Ben, listen...You know, Morgan's mom...

12:47.767 --> 12:50.987
I used to drop her off
at Ziva's office late at night

12:51.031 --> 12:52.510
so they could
talk, you know?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.512
She used to call Ziva
her nightlight.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.036
And when I found
out Ziva had died,

12:56.079 --> 12:59.517
I thought that that,
uh... that light,

12:59.561 --> 13:01.563
that hope for justice
had gone out, too, but now...

13:01.606 --> 13:05.610
Hold-hold on. Ben, you mentioned
Ziva's office. You mean NCIS?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.917
No. The-the-the
other office.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.484
The one behind
the house on Leland.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.746
Leland and what?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.183
Uh, east of 14th, maybe?

13:13.227 --> 13:15.490
Uh, look, Ben,

13:15.533 --> 13:17.709
there have been some
developments in Morgan's case.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.494
Agent Torres will fill you in.

13:20.495 --> 13:23.411
What's going on?

13:25.456 --> 13:26.849
Amber Alert.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.287
Hang on, hang on.
Uh, what...?

13:30.331 --> 13:32.376
Hey, Dr. Conrad. What...?It's Lily.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.422
I stepped out to get her chart,
and she was gone.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.553
Oh, no, Lily.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.164
Lily.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.688
Lily. Did you see
a little gir-- Lily!

13:39.731 --> 13:41.864
Lil...

13:41.908 --> 13:43.561
Lily!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.435
Hey.

13:47.478 --> 13:50.394
Hey, just give me a minute.
I have her.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.484
Hey, there, Lily.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.139
It's just me.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.018
Can I tell you a secret?

14:06.584 --> 14:09.370
Okay.

14:09.413 --> 14:12.895
A long time ago,

14:12.939 --> 14:16.290
I had a baby girl.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.728
She was perfect,

14:19.771 --> 14:21.686
just like you.

14:21.730 --> 14:26.387
But I only got to
hold her once.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.911
But I felt her little fingers,

14:28.955 --> 14:32.349
and her head on my chest,
and I loved her.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.960
I...

14:34.003 --> 14:36.571
I loved her so much,

14:36.614 --> 14:40.880
that I, I had to send her away.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.233
My mom loves me, too.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.453
Yes, she does.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.499
That's why I was thinking

14:51.542 --> 14:53.718
maybe she sent you away, too,
is that right?

14:57.287 --> 15:01.509
And now it's our turn
to help her.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
I have a dad.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.820
His name is Ben.

15:08.864 --> 15:12.520
Mommy said he was like Superman.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.479
So maybe he can save her.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.525
Yeah, maybe.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.833
Uh, and what about you, though,
Lily?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.661
Think you can be brave
for your mom?

15:25.054 --> 15:28.536
Tell me about the man
who locked the door.

15:28.579 --> 15:32.018
Robert.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
Do you know his last name?

15:36.239 --> 15:38.676
There was another man, too.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.287
Buddy.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.986
He was nicer.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.511
He brought us food
when Robert was away.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.560
But Robert...

15:52.603 --> 15:55.345
Robert hurt Mommy

15:55.389 --> 15:57.739
and I hid under the sink.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.095
Mommy said...

16:06.139 --> 16:09.751
to give her to the police
when I got out.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.059
Thank you.

16:13.102 --> 16:17.585
Lily, honey,
how did you get out?

16:17.628 --> 16:22.024
No. No. I want Mommy.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.808
Oh. I know, I know.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.680
I know you do, sweetheart.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.116
Come here.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.337
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

16:30.380 --> 16:33.427
Update, McGee.
Where are we with the grid?

16:33.470 --> 16:37.170
Well, our agents have searched
every home with a basement

16:37.213 --> 16:39.433
within a five-mile radius
of where Lily was found.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.869
So far, nothing.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.524
Bottom line is we need
to know how Lily escaped

16:43.567 --> 16:45.917
in order to know where
to look for Morgan.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.441
Where is Torres
and Bishop?

16:47.484 --> 16:48.920
Haven't heard from them.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.140
Agent Gibbs, Detective Atwood
from Breen County.

16:51.184 --> 16:55.492
Yeah, I saw you
giving a speech on TV.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.407
Listen, Sheriff Jones
sent over a formal request

16:57.451 --> 16:59.279
for a joint investigation
an hour ago.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.498
I didn't see it.It was sent to your director.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.587
Yeah. I got it
and I'm denying it.

17:03.631 --> 17:08.288
Here is my formal
response... on paper.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.116
Thank you for saving me
the cost of a messenger.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.293
Listen, we're just looking to
pool every available resource.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.164
We want Morgan home
same as you.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.166
You know, boss, if he
really wants to help,

17:17.210 --> 17:20.039
he could find out whose remains
those were in Morgan's car.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.997
'Cause they sure weren't hers,
like you said.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.521
Yeah. Why don't you do that?

17:24.565 --> 17:26.175
And give our regards
to the sheriff.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.832
Tell you what,
this new pen

17:30.875 --> 17:34.009
makes me write
like a big dog.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.186
So I made the initial incision
here, enabling me

17:37.230 --> 17:40.494
to peel back the epidermis--
w-well, the-the fabric,

17:40.537 --> 17:43.018
uh, showing me
what was inside.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.455
Stuffing.Hairs.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.370
There were two distinct
DNA profiles in there.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.372
I'm running them both
through the system now.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.766
SLOANE:
My God, that is brilliant.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.420
Morgan sewed the DNA in the
doll, and told her daughter

17:53.463 --> 17:55.117
to give it to the police
when she escaped.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.553
She essentially handed us
the identity of her captors.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.773
If... we get a ding.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.601
Ooh, that is what

18:00.644 --> 18:03.256
I am talking about.The hairs?

18:03.299 --> 18:04.648
KASIE:
Yeah, I got a hit
on one of them.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.389
A Robert Hill.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.391
Lily said her captor's names
were Robert and Buddy.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.958
Robert being the primary.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.700
Uh, it looks like he was
arrested in 2008 for assault.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.398
Got probation,
last known address...

18:15.442 --> 18:16.747
is now a strip mall.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.098
But it looks like
a guy named Bud Hill

18:19.141 --> 18:21.796
bailed him out of jail.
Relation, brother.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.538
Buddy.Got an address for him in D.C.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.410
Hey, Gibbs.
We got something.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.991
Yeah.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.393
What the hell are you doing?

18:53.436 --> 18:55.090
Kasie called.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.223
She caught me up to speed.Where's Bishop?

18:57.266 --> 18:59.007
I don't know.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.356
McGEE:
Boss.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.190
GIBBS:
That him?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.757
McGEE:
Yep. Buddy Hill.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.411
There's no basement,

19:11.454 --> 19:13.891
and no evidence that Lily
and Morgan were ever here.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.416
Sloane said the brother
was the primary.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.244
The badder one.Yeah, Robert Hill.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.420
He's got Morgan
somewhere else.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.206
My neighbor said you were
wandering the streets.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.774
Oh, yeah. I didn't know
the exact address.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.254
Mm-hmm.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.126
So Ziva rented
this place from you?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.129
Just the office.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.262
She started
back in 2005,

19:36.305 --> 19:39.134
paid for it in advance
to help me financially.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.441
Because that was
her way, wasn't it?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.443
A warmth beneath
the armor.

19:43.486 --> 19:46.228
Mm. You never
rented it out after that?

19:46.272 --> 19:47.969
Oh, no.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.972
The last time Ziva made
a payment was four years ago

19:51.015 --> 19:53.931
from Israel before her death.

19:53.975 --> 19:58.284
So, technically, it's still
hers through next year.

19:58.327 --> 20:01.896
Out of respect,
I haven't touched it.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.550
Wait.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.814
Show me your badge again.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.516
I'll leave you to it.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.388
GIBBS :
Bishop, where are you?

21:42.431 --> 21:45.129
Uh, Gibbs...

21:45.173 --> 21:48.219
I have something to tell you.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.533
McGEE:
"For weeks, it was darkness.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.406
"I had stopped counting
the horrors I endured.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.365
"And then the monster
lifted the hood.

22:03.409 --> 22:06.368
"The light spilled in,
and I saw my friend.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.979
"My heart saw him as
if for the first time,

22:09.023 --> 22:11.808
and I knew I could
not live without him."

22:11.852 --> 22:14.681
That was from when she
was captured in Somalia, right?

22:14.724 --> 22:17.553
So, you guys didn't
know about this place?

22:17.597 --> 22:19.120
Gibbs, she didn't tell you?

22:19.163 --> 22:20.600
No.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.906
Did you talk to DiNozzo?

22:22.950 --> 22:26.257
I tried. Senior said he's
on his way back to Paris.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.911
I left a message.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.523
Listen, boss, there really isn't
anything classified in these.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.308
I don't feel right
about reading them anymore.Okay.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.483
So don't.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.405
But tell me what
she was doing here.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.929
Well, she started
renting this place

22:45.973 --> 22:48.932
right after she became
a liaison at NCIS.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.804
The first few books
are in Hebrew.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.588
She switched
to English after that.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.634
McGEE:
Each one of these books
represents a case

22:54.677 --> 22:56.418
that Ziva was working on.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.072
She wrote about
what she was feeling.

22:58.115 --> 23:01.118
How the grief of
a victim's family
pained her.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.251
How a killer made his
way into her dreams.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.601
Things she couldn't put
in an official report.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.429
Personal things.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.562
It's like every case got
into her head, and she had

23:09.605 --> 23:11.955
to get it out somehow,
and so she did...

23:11.999 --> 23:14.305
on paper, alone in this room.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.612
And, uh, this is
the one on the...

23:16.656 --> 23:18.527
Morgan Burke case.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.966
Whoa.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.099
I like this woman.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.448
What do you got, Torres?

23:26.492 --> 23:28.319
I went through the
rest of the files

23:28.363 --> 23:29.799
that Ziva had at NCIS.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.280
20-some-odd suspects.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.978
Ziva... cleared all of them.

23:35.022 --> 23:38.155
Wait, you knew that Ziva was
investigating after the handoff?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.158
Go back to headquarters.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.247
Get back on the case. Go.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.335
Boss...

23:44.379 --> 23:45.467
Tim.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.556
I got it.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.908
I will take care of her things.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.438
Gibbs--
Morgan Burke--

23:59.481 --> 24:01.570
clearly, every case
mattered to Ziva,

24:01.614 --> 24:03.050
but she kept
investigating this one

24:03.093 --> 24:04.965
even after it was handed off
and you knew about it.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.357
So why was this case
so important?

24:06.401 --> 24:09.317
The next time you withhold
relevant information,

24:09.360 --> 24:11.580
you are gone.

24:11.624 --> 24:14.583
Gibbs...
Rule ten.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.327
Get back to the office.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.548
Keep your head
in the game.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.517
JIMMY:
Death has a way

24:35.561 --> 24:38.346
of finding us all--
the good ones, the bad ones,

24:38.389 --> 24:40.609
and even the enablers
of evil.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.959
Like you, brother Buddy.

24:43.003 --> 24:46.354
Body tell us anything about
where Morgan might be?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.051
Well...

24:48.095 --> 24:50.358
I'm afraid...

24:50.401 --> 24:51.968
not a word.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.362
Hey, Jimmy?Yeah?

24:54.405 --> 24:56.059
I, uh, I scanned through

24:56.103 --> 24:59.149
some of Ziva's journals,
and she mentions

24:59.193 --> 25:02.239
a "basement confidant"
quite a bit.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.415
She called him Mr. H.,
which stood for...

25:04.459 --> 25:06.548
Happy as an Oyster?Yes.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.724
But shouldn't
it be "clam"?
It should.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.726
It should be "clam," yeah.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.554
It's about you, right?

25:12.598 --> 25:14.425
I had no idea

25:14.469 --> 25:16.036
you two were so close.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.560
Eh, it must be something about
being this far underground--

25:18.604 --> 25:20.431
you know, people feel safe,

25:20.475 --> 25:23.260
like they can
really confide in me.Hey, uh...

25:23.304 --> 25:28.265
so, do you feel like it would
be an invasion of privacy

25:28.309 --> 25:30.267
for me to read this?

25:30.311 --> 25:32.748
I just...
I really want to find out

25:32.792 --> 25:35.272
why this case was
so important to her.

25:35.316 --> 25:36.839
Well, I could tell you that.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.275
She told you?

25:38.319 --> 25:39.755
She did. Yeah.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.018
So, this was one of her
first solo assignments

25:42.062 --> 25:43.454
as an NCIS probie.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.369
She was just following up
on a recruit

25:45.413 --> 25:47.110
who failed to report.

25:47.154 --> 25:51.680
But when she got to the scene,
the sheriff's office told Ziva

25:51.724 --> 25:53.639
that the case was theirs.Mm.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.772
She was the one who
handed over the case.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.296
Yeah. And when Gibbs
found out...

25:59.340 --> 26:01.037
He was...

26:01.081 --> 26:04.693
well, he really laid into her.

26:04.737 --> 26:08.044
He said: Morgan Burke
took an oath.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.786
She wasNavy.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.963
And we never hand over
one of our own.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.313
That was a mistake.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.838
And it was a mistake
that Ziva never forgot.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.666
So she never stopped
investigating.

26:20.709 --> 26:24.800
That was the thing that
I will remember most about her.

26:24.844 --> 26:28.195
She-she was always just so...

26:30.023 --> 26:32.329
Put it this way--

26:32.373 --> 26:34.897
she'd see that fire
in your eyes...

26:34.941 --> 26:38.379
she would have told you
to read every word.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.608
GIBBS:
His own brother cut his throat.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.176
Wow. Are we sure?

26:53.220 --> 26:54.874
Kasie is.

26:54.917 --> 26:58.007
Robert Hill's fingerprints
were all over the murder weapon.

26:58.051 --> 27:01.663
So he trusts his brother
to feed his captives

27:01.707 --> 27:04.579
whenever he's out of town,
and he repays said brother

27:04.623 --> 27:06.625
by taking him out
with a beer stein.

27:06.668 --> 27:07.887
Family first.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.542
Robert Hill is
tying up loose ends.

27:11.586 --> 27:12.892
He knows Lily escaped.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.155
Good chance he's
on the run with Morgan.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.200
Or worse.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.550
Gibbs.Leon.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.378
Clock's ticking.This, um,

27:21.422 --> 27:23.990
outside office
of Special Agent David's.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.209
Yeah, I'm handling it.
I have the journals.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.647
I'll clear out the rest
of it when this is over.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.474
It's just a room, I know.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.955
But it must be
bringing up a lot.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.130
Lot of what?

27:34.174 --> 27:36.698
When a daughter keeps
a secret like that,

27:36.742 --> 27:39.483
father has to ask himself why.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.877
She didn't think
I would approve.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.923
She was right.

27:48.579 --> 27:49.972
Lily?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.235
Hiya.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.632
I have someone
I want you to meet.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.025
Hey.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.461
It's okay.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.723
This...

28:01.767 --> 28:03.464
is Ben.

28:05.509 --> 28:09.035
This is your dad.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.645
Hi.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.866
It's okay.

28:13.909 --> 28:18.044
Hey, Lily. I've been...
been so excited to meet you.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.699
I think this is
yours, right?

28:26.443 --> 28:28.750
Mommy said you had
a mark on your hand

28:28.794 --> 28:30.447
that was like a heart.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.753
Yeah.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.451
She said you were like Superman.

28:34.495 --> 28:37.498
Please... you have to save her.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.674
Oh...

28:41.545 --> 28:43.591
Hey, Lily, hey.

28:43.634 --> 28:46.376
Listen.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.465
The only way

28:48.509 --> 28:51.207
I can help your mom
is if you tell me

28:51.251 --> 28:53.601
exactly how you got out.

28:53.644 --> 28:56.038
Okay?

28:58.301 --> 29:00.782
Robert hates germs.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.437
Everything has to be clean.

29:05.265 --> 29:09.008
So Mommy burned us
to look like bites.

29:09.051 --> 29:12.576
She told him our mattress
had bugs in it.

29:14.970 --> 29:19.366
And she made a spot for me
to fit inside the mattress.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.846
SLOANE:
Did your mom convince Robert

29:20.889 --> 29:22.891
to take the mattress
out of the basement

29:22.935 --> 29:24.284
and get rid of it?

29:26.242 --> 29:30.029
He took it to the place
with all the garbage.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.813
Uh, the-the dump?

29:33.772 --> 29:37.863
I crawled out after I heard
his truck drive away.

29:38.907 --> 29:42.519
And then I ran until
I was too tired.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.391
Oh, hey, you did so good.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.393
Good girl.
You did good, Lily.

29:53.139 --> 29:55.097
Hey, buck up, dudes.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.839
The mattress ought to be
around here somewhere.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.842
Oh. Oh, seriously?

30:00.886 --> 30:03.802
Please, don't even tell me
what just leaked on my pants.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.281
Mama, this better be
the right place.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.544
Oh, no, this is the only dump
within ten miles

30:07.588 --> 30:09.329
of that storage unit.
Right, McGee?

30:10.417 --> 30:11.592
Hey, McGee?

30:11.635 --> 30:14.943
What? Oh, yeah,
yeah. Sorry.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.599
It's been a... it's been
a crazy couple days.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.296
Uh, hey, Kasie?

30:20.340 --> 30:21.689
Hmm?

30:23.734 --> 30:25.519
Did I do
something to you?

30:25.562 --> 30:27.390
What?
You know,
like something

30:27.434 --> 30:29.262
that would make you
want to give me

30:29.305 --> 30:30.959
an empty jar
as a gift?

30:31.003 --> 30:32.700
What?

30:32.743 --> 30:35.311
No. I just... I never heard you
mention something you wanted,

30:35.355 --> 30:37.705
so I decided to give you
something you needed.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.229
What am I gonna do
with an empty jar?

30:40.273 --> 30:42.884
I don't know. Put something
in it you don't want to lose.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.756
I don't know. Look,
everybody needs an empty jar.They do?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.759
I found it.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.461
This has got to be it.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.811
That's where Lily hid.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.204
Can you imagine?

30:59.683 --> 31:01.555
Hey. Wait, so, Morgan Burke,

31:01.598 --> 31:03.557
she makes a plan,
she executes it--

31:03.600 --> 31:05.559
the mattress, the
hairs inside the doll.

31:05.602 --> 31:08.910
We got to think that
if Robert Hill's on
the move with her,

31:08.954 --> 31:10.390
she's leaving more clues.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.044
What are you telling me?

31:12.087 --> 31:14.785
I made a tip line for the public
to call in with info on Morgan.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.183
Okay.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.968
Yes, Gibbs,

31:23.011 --> 31:24.186
I read this.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.927
But I learned something.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.407
Ziva, she let everything in.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.017
She let it affect her.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.237
And it made her work harder,
but it also,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.239
it made her see clearer.

31:33.282 --> 31:36.416
I told you to keep your head
in the game.

31:36.459 --> 31:40.028
The stuff in here
matters, Gibbs.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.813
Look. Look
at this last page.

31:44.119 --> 31:45.947
Morgan's mom, she had cancer.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.949
Before she died,
she dictated a letter,

31:47.993 --> 31:49.472
and Ziva wrote it down.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.126
Do you see this?

31:51.170 --> 31:54.347
Ziva promised to read this to
the man who did this to Morgan.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.522
That's relevant how?

31:56.827 --> 31:59.134
When we get Robert Hill...

31:59.178 --> 32:01.615
I'm gonna read him this letter.

32:01.658 --> 32:04.574
I'm going to honor
Ziva's promise.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.666
Rule ten. Say it.

32:11.581 --> 32:12.974
Say it.

32:14.671 --> 32:17.761
Never get personally involved
on a case.

32:19.024 --> 32:19.981
So what?

32:20.025 --> 32:22.288
No, so what?
I connect with Lily,

32:22.331 --> 32:24.377
a-and you put me
in the field.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.292
I want to fulfill the dying wish

32:26.335 --> 32:28.468
of our victim's mother,
and you say "Rule Ten"?

32:28.511 --> 32:31.514
No, Ziva was personally
involved in every case.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.126
Don't you tell me about Ziva!Then what about you?

32:34.169 --> 32:36.302
You were furious
when she handed off the case

32:36.345 --> 32:38.565
because you take every case
personally, too,

32:38.608 --> 32:41.568
even one you only had
for half a second.: Enough.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.613
No. Rule Ten-- it's B.S.

32:43.657 --> 32:47.487
Every time I look at that
desk, you know what I see?

32:47.530 --> 32:49.576
She is not there.

32:51.447 --> 32:53.972
You ignore Rule Ten,
you go too far,

32:54.015 --> 32:56.278
you end up dead just like her.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.892
Go home. You're off this case.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.691
BISHOP:
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.259
Uh, of course, yeah.

33:20.302 --> 33:22.043
She asked me to hang on.Hey.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.784
Look, I know I
said you could have

33:23.827 --> 33:25.220
your tip line
transferred down here,

33:25.264 --> 33:27.440
but that was before I knew
Gibbs sent you home.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.703
Yeah, but the woman on the phone
might have the location

33:29.746 --> 33:31.183
of Robert Hill's uncle.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.489
Uh-huh. What do you
think Gibbs is gonna do

33:33.533 --> 33:35.665
if he sees you down
in my lab working,

33:35.709 --> 33:38.146
as opposed to at home
regretting your life choices?

33:38.190 --> 33:40.322
And there he is now.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.150
Kasie, I have to do this.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.630
GIBBS:
Update! Let's go!

33:43.673 --> 33:45.284
Yes.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.895
Torres. Uh, hiya, Gibbs.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.028
Listen, I wanted to explain

33:50.071 --> 33:52.073
about that hunk of wood
in your parking space.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.683
Yeah, the white oak.
I loved it.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.469
Now give me something else.Yeah. Okay.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.166
Um, well, Lily said

33:58.210 --> 34:00.299
that when she was
inside this mattress,

34:00.342 --> 34:03.867
Robert Hill dragged it out
of his house to his truck.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.653
On the side that scraped
the ground, I found something.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.046
The address
of where they're holding Morgan?

34:08.089 --> 34:10.048
Man, how easy
do you think this job is?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.572
No. I found bird poop.You ID the bird?

34:12.615 --> 34:15.183
You mean did I get the bird's
name and Social Security number?

34:15.227 --> 34:17.055
No. Seriously, you two?

34:17.098 --> 34:20.101
I analyzed the excrement
and confirmed that it came

34:20.145 --> 34:24.062
from a caique parrot,
and according to the website,

34:24.105 --> 34:26.586
"Caiques of Fairfax County,"
two pet caiques

34:26.629 --> 34:29.110
were accidentally released
and have since spawned.

34:29.154 --> 34:33.810
They are often spotted in this
area of northeast Virginia.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.247
Still so many houses.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.553
Got something
from Detective Atwood.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.425
Love letter
from the sheriff?

34:39.468 --> 34:42.384
Oh, no. Actually, Atwood did
exactly what we asked him to do.

34:42.428 --> 34:45.518
He reanalyzed a sample of the
remains found in Morgan's car.

34:45.561 --> 34:49.609
Turns out they found traces
of heat refractory concrete.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.132
From a cremation
chamber.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.134
Yeah, the remains
were likely stolen.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.657
Atwood tracked down
a crematorium where

34:54.701 --> 34:56.268
Robert Hill worked
ten years ago

34:56.311 --> 34:57.921
under the alias
"Randall Howe."

34:57.965 --> 35:00.272
Randall Howe.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.925
Got it.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.188
One home address for

35:03.231 --> 35:05.538
a Randall Howe
within our bird-poop radius.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.583
Send it.

35:12.632 --> 35:15.635
Bishop, did you hear that?
We got him!

35:18.290 --> 35:19.813
Bishop?

35:33.653 --> 35:36.134
GIBBS:
Lights.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.275
TORRES:
They're not here.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.933
Kasie.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.456
KASIE:
Gibbs, Bishop's gone.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.850
Where is she?

36:00.332 --> 36:01.811
Mr. Fisher?

36:01.855 --> 36:02.769
They found us.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.945
I see your truck
in the driveway.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.947
Get to the boat.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.558
Move!

36:09.602 --> 36:12.822
I need to talk to you
about your nephew, Robert Hill.

36:12.866 --> 36:13.997
Help me!Shut up.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.612
Get in the boat!

36:22.354 --> 36:23.833
NCIS!

36:23.877 --> 36:26.401
Help...
Shut up.

36:26.445 --> 36:27.489
You put the gun down,

36:27.533 --> 36:28.838
or she's dead, you hear me?

36:28.882 --> 36:30.492
Put it down!

36:30.536 --> 36:32.842
Look, I ain't playing, lady!

36:32.886 --> 36:35.932
Okay. Okay.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.892
Putting it down.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.372
There it is, Robert.

36:40.415 --> 36:43.026
Putting it down, okay?

36:43.070 --> 36:45.028
Now it's your turn.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.595
I need you to
let her go.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.423
You stay there!

36:48.467 --> 36:50.556
You stay where you...
Uh. Uh.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.253
You stay...

37:04.265 --> 37:06.224
GIBBS:
I had a dream that I was her.

37:07.964 --> 37:11.577
I was trapped.
I could not get out.

37:13.274 --> 37:18.148
Yet I believed
there would be a savior.

37:23.415 --> 37:26.287
To the very end, I believed.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.247
But sometimes,
a savior never comes.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.074
Stop!

37:31.118 --> 37:32.075
McGEE:
NCIS!

37:32.119 --> 37:33.120
Drop the weapon!

37:45.785 --> 37:48.440
GIBBS:
Hey. Hey!

37:49.484 --> 37:51.269
You're done.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.404
Ellie?!

37:59.146 --> 38:02.236
Okay.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.543
GIBBS:
When I awoke,
I knew I must not forget

38:04.586 --> 38:07.241
what it was to be her.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.637
Oh.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.029
Okay.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.205
There we go.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.077
Hi. Lily?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.470
Where's Lily?

38:18.513 --> 38:20.254
She's safe.
You're safe.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.821
Okay? Okay.Oh.

38:21.864 --> 38:24.258
GIBBS:
So I fight, and I kick,

38:24.302 --> 38:27.522
and I scream, and I feel...

38:28.958 --> 38:30.873
Mommy!

38:30.917 --> 38:33.441
GIBBS:
...and that is good.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.487
Hey.Uh.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.670
GIBBS:
It is good to let it in.

38:48.978 --> 38:51.024
It is good to feel.

38:58.074 --> 39:02.992
"Because feeling
brings me power.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.647
"Feeling is what
makes me realize

39:05.691 --> 39:08.520
"that the savior
I have been waiting for

39:08.563 --> 39:10.565
is me."

39:16.745 --> 39:20.009
That was on page one.

39:20.053 --> 39:23.012
The first thing
Ziva wrote about this case.

39:23.056 --> 39:26.146
Yeah.

39:37.244 --> 39:40.073
Robert Hill had a heart attack
on the way back.

39:40.116 --> 39:43.076
He's at Mercy Point, Room 118.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.560
Do what you have to do.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.437
Gibbs...I know.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.527
I know.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.492
BISHOP:
Robert Hill.

40:51.536 --> 40:55.104
Hey, Robert.

40:57.759 --> 41:00.458
You. What do you want?

41:00.501 --> 41:04.810
I have something to read to you,
and you're gonna listen.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.943
It's a letter
from Morgan's mother.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.684
Yeah, I got it.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.905
What?

41:12.948 --> 41:16.299
Somebody already came here
and read it to me.

41:23.785 --> 41:27.006
Who?

41:29.574 --> 41:33.099
She told me she was
gonna haunt my dreams.
