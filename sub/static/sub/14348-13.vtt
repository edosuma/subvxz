00:17.050 --> 00:19.986
How's it going, Tom?
Can I get you anything?

00:20.387 --> 00:22.922
You want some food
or something?

00:25.425 --> 00:27.892
A beautiful service.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.929
I thought the priest
did a great job.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.401
You need anything to eat,
sweetheart?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.770
Did he say anything yet?
Not yet.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.474
Hey, you need anything,
you just holler, all right?

00:41.975 --> 00:43.977
'Cause we'll be
right here.

01:31.157 --> 01:34.561
Tommy, you okay in there?

01:35.995 --> 01:38.298
Jesus,
I thought you fell in.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.032
I got one of these
for each of us.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.703
This one's Coke with a
shitload of bourbon in it.

01:43.738 --> 01:46.339
It's the only thing that's
gonna take the pain away.

01:46.639 --> 01:50.977
Not a-- Not a person in here
is gonna think the worse of you.

01:52.712 --> 01:56.015
I'm so sorry, Tommy.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.317
I'm so sorry.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.854
Hey, is that-- Is that
the probie and Garrity?

02:01.889 --> 02:04.357
God, this party is like
a goddamn meat market.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.392
You all right?
Yeah.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.395
Yeah. I'll check with you
later, all right? You sure?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.865
Okay, cheers.
I'll check with you later.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.150
Was he wearing a helmet?
I don't know.

02:30.683 --> 02:33.651
No point in asking now.
Not gonna change anything.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.653
You keeping an eye on him?
Is he going to his meetings?

02:35.688 --> 02:39.657
Oh, yeah. I mean, he missed a
couple because of everything.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.695
But, uh, other than using fake
names and not coping with the fact...

02:42.730 --> 02:45.215
that he's got a serious problem,
he's doing great.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.665
I hope to Christ
he doesn't fall off the wagon.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.168
I wouldn't blame the poor
bastard if he drove the wagon...

02:50.203 --> 02:53.039
right through the liquor store
window and drank the entire inventory.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.075
Hi.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.846
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

03:00.246 --> 03:04.417
- I miss my brother.
- Yeah. Yeah. I'll bet.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.919
But you know what, Katy?

03:07.954 --> 03:10.421
You just, uh--
You just gotta remember...

03:10.456 --> 03:14.961
that you're gonna see him again
someday, you know, up in heaven.

03:18.765 --> 03:22.268
You wanna help me out here?
Say something. Say something.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.437
Say something!

03:30.777 --> 03:34.812
Um, see,

03:34.847 --> 03:40.153
Katy, um, where he is right now,
there's no pain.

03:40.188 --> 03:42.921
He's happy,

03:42.956 --> 03:46.226
and he, um, doesn't remember
anything about the accident.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.763
God makes that go away.
Is that true?

03:50.964 --> 03:54.767
That's what I heard.
Wow. Wow.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.308
Listen, Katy, you just-- You
gotta know that Connor's fine,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.445
and he's being taken care of,
and you're gonna see him again.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.216
No, I won't. Yes, you
will, sweetie. I promise.

04:10.251 --> 04:14.120
No, I won't,
because there's no heaven.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.390
Of course there's a heaven,
honey.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.526
Prove it.

04:28.501 --> 04:32.071
Um, you see,
y-you just--

04:32.572 --> 04:36.808
You have to... believe.
I do believe.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.613
I believe there's no heaven,
just like there's no God.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.884
Human beings made those things
up so we could feel special.

04:45.151 --> 04:49.722
More special
than animals or bugs,

04:50.223 --> 04:52.190
because we're scared.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.994
We need to think there's
someone out there protecting us,

04:55.194 --> 04:57.263
watching over us.

04:57.764 --> 05:02.502
We're nothing. We come from
dirt. We go back into the dirt.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.772
See ya.

05:15.615 --> 05:19.619
Listen, Katy-- Can you
please leave me alone now?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.858
Absolutely.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.445
Honey, how you doin'?

05:46.879 --> 05:49.782
Not great.
I know.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.754
If you ever want to talk--

05:55.254 --> 05:59.742
'Cause, you know, I know what
it's like to lose someone so close.

05:59.777 --> 06:04.230
So, I just feel like if you ever
want to talk to me ever, Janet--

06:04.265 --> 06:06.698
Thanks.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.236
And, honey, you can't blame Tommy.
There's nothing that he could've done.

06:10.271 --> 06:12.538
You don't know that.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.808
Okay, but look at him.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.276
He's hurting too.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.613
I mean, you can't make this
harder on him than it already is.

06:20.913 --> 06:25.451
Is this any of your business?
Yeah, you know what? I think it is.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.989
Because, Janet, he needs you, and
you can't turn your back on him.

06:30.024 --> 06:33.593
Can somebody get her away
from me, please? Really.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.929
Get off me!
Don't touch me!

06:42.468 --> 06:44.435
You know what?

06:44.470 --> 06:48.107
You have a good man, Janet,
and you don't even know it.

06:48.474 --> 06:51.811
You've never known it.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.714
I'm so sorry.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.531
I'm leaving, Tom.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.033
I can't stay here.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.537
Everywhere I look, it--

07:20.039 --> 07:23.042
I'm taking the girls,
and I'm going to a hotel.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.688
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

07:37.723 --> 07:40.860
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

07:40.895 --> 07:43.761
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

07:43.796 --> 07:46.964
Things were good
when we were young

07:46.999 --> 07:50.386
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

07:50.421 --> 07:53.773
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

07:53.808 --> 07:57.241
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

07:57.276 --> 08:00.412
Things were good
when we were young

08:00.447 --> 08:03.514
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

08:03.549 --> 08:06.702
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

08:06.737 --> 08:10.064
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

08:10.099 --> 08:13.392
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

08:17.697 --> 08:20.998
You had to be there, Lou.
It was eerie. Yeah, spooky.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.936
Like a horror movie where the little kid's
a total freak who kills everyone in the end.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.906
Yeah, and the way she was
talking, uh, and her eyes.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.276
She didn't blink the entire time we were
with her. She didn't. I was watching.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.077
You know, guys,
she's a little girl.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.548
Her brother just died.
She's dealing with it.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.984
Oh, no. She's dealt with it,
you know? Rock solid.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.385
You should have heard her.
No heaven, no God.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.222
You know what? The thing is,
she sounded so sure.

08:44.256 --> 08:48.160
- Anybody seen Jerry?
- Yeah. He's at the hospital, Chief, dealing with his wife.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.797
- What's wrong with her now?
- She tried to kill herself.

08:52.064 --> 08:56.602
I'll be doing the same if people don't
start showing up for their shifts on time.

08:59.605 --> 09:03.007
Heart of gold with a
creamy center of pure shit.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.279
But seriously, guys, this whole Katy
thing is freaking me out. I can't shake it.

09:06.314 --> 09:08.314
- So you think there's a heaven?
- Of course.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.915
- People standing around on clouds all day?
- Well, yeah.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.886
- With wings? - We-- I don't know
about wings. That seems a little stupid.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.756
But people standing around all day on
water vapor. That's perfectly reasonable?

09:18.124 --> 09:20.091
Look, all I'm saying is
that there is a heaven, okay?

09:20.126 --> 09:23.496
I've always believed that. What it is
exactly, that's up to each individual person.

09:23.796 --> 09:26.165
You know? Like my heaven, for
example, I mean, there's clouds.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.969
-We've established that.
-But there's a lot of downtime, you know?

09:30.004 --> 09:33.339
And you can play video games all
day. Oh, and the best part is,

09:33.639 --> 09:35.207
if you, like, want
a Mountain Dew or something,

09:35.708 --> 09:37.209
you don't have to go and get it
and open the can, you know?

09:37.710 --> 09:41.714
You just-- You think it,
and the taste just...

09:42.148 --> 09:44.650
appears in your mouth,
and you're quenched.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.620
- You know, your thirst.
-Cool.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.425
Are you going to be able
to stay at home with her?

09:52.460 --> 09:56.794
No. I-I-I can't.
I work.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.231
Can you afford 24-hour
in-home care?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.133
I'm a New York City firefighter.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.186
I can barely afford
24-hour electricity.

10:04.221 --> 10:06.739
Then I think there's
really only one option.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.876
Which is?
Moving her into a facility.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.113
There's an excellent extended-care
facility in Brookfield, Connecticut.

10:14.148 --> 10:16.847
A friend of mine runs it.
Dr. Philip Brockelman.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.852
They deal almost exclusively
with Alzheimer's patients.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.820
Hold on here. Hold on.
You're telling me...

10:22.855 --> 10:26.324
that I have to put my wife
of 31 years into a home?

10:26.359 --> 10:29.362
Is that what you're telling me? I
think it's come to that, Mr. Reilly.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.164
No, I-I couldn't.
I can't.

10:33.199 --> 10:36.902
The next time she tries to kill herself,
do you think you might consider it then?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.238
I don't mean to be cold.

10:39.772 --> 10:43.075
No. No, you don't
mean to be.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.853
Franks and beans
with a delightful green salad.

10:55.888 --> 11:01.460
You have roughly three minutes to make
disparaging comments, and then I will be back.

11:10.536 --> 11:14.540
Enjoy. Just glad Julia Child
didn't live to see this.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.045
You good?
You need anything?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.550
All right. Well, if you do,
you get your ass downstairs...

11:24.585 --> 11:27.053
and get it yourself,
all right?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.055
Put in an appearance, okay?

11:34.060 --> 11:37.063
You know, I always used to
think how great it would be...

11:37.098 --> 11:40.066
if you would just shut
the hell up and let me talk.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.071
It ain't that great.

11:59.585 --> 12:03.622
- Yeah?
- Hi, Kenny. It's me. I got really good news.

12:03.657 --> 12:06.392
Oh, that's great.
I could use some. Shoot.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.962
I'm out. I'm done.
I'm free, thanks to you.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.729
He took the money?
Yes, sir.

12:11.764 --> 12:15.267
I don't belong to F-Bomb
anymore. I don't belong to anyone.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.235
Just you. That's great.
We gotta celebrate.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.773
I'm gonna go out and get the biggest,
most expensive bottle of champagne...

12:20.808 --> 12:23.741
I can get my fat fingers
on. You don't have any money.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.578
It's all right. I'll steal it.
I'll be over right after my shift.

12:25.613 --> 12:27.678
No, no. Wait, wait.
I can't tonight.

12:27.713 --> 12:30.783
What do you mean? We gotta
celebrate. We will when I get back.

12:30.983 --> 12:35.054
I gotta go to Jersey a couple of days.
My mom is sick. My father is useless.

12:35.089 --> 12:37.456
I know what you mean. I gotta
go cook and clean and shit.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.758
- When are you gonna be back?
- Friday. We'll celebrate Friday night.

12:40.793 --> 12:45.498
I can't wait. I feel like I'm kind of
getting a second chance here, you know?

12:45.798 --> 12:48.200
And thanks, babe.
For what?

12:48.467 --> 12:51.802
I'll tell you Friday.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.605
I don't know what to do.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.377
It's the first time in my
life I feel totally lost.

12:58.412 --> 13:02.114
When's she out of the
hospital, Chief? Friday.

13:02.648 --> 13:06.652
Little girl doctor tells me I should
take her straight up to Brookfield.

13:06.687 --> 13:11.157
Just drive up there and
drop her off and drive away.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.659
Not see her for,
like, six weeks.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.162
Jesus Christ, man.
Six weeks?

13:16.197 --> 13:18.129
Why?

13:18.164 --> 13:24.135
She says so Jeannie can
readjust to her new surroundings.

13:24.170 --> 13:29.175
As if her brain will reset if she doesn't
have anything to remind her of her past life.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.178
Whew!
That's cold, Chief.

13:33.679 --> 13:39.185
This goddamn disease,
it's stealing my girl away.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.692
Don't look at me, kid.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.032
Paul.
Franco.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.570
Hey. Hey, Laura,
we're packing up.

13:58.070 --> 14:01.574
I know. Probie lost his halligan
for the second time this week.

14:01.609 --> 14:04.094
I'm helping him find it.
Nice, Mike.

14:04.129 --> 14:06.544
Here, I'll help you
look for it.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.082
So, you, uh--
You done any more thinking?

14:10.117 --> 14:12.049
A little.

14:12.084 --> 14:15.588
Anything you want to share?

14:15.623 --> 14:17.590
Yeah. I'm an idiot.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.557
Excuse me?

14:19.592 --> 14:22.061
You know, this firefighting
thing wasn't a lark.

14:22.096 --> 14:24.597
I didn't just come up
with this one day.

14:25.097 --> 14:29.602
I saw a news show when I was, like, seven
years old about a female firefighter,

14:30.102 --> 14:34.106
and I was, like, "That's it.
That's what I want to do."

14:34.141 --> 14:36.540
And I went and I
told my father, and--

14:36.575 --> 14:40.112
he pretty much
laughed in my face.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.081
He was, like, "You can't do
that, sweetheart. You're a girl."

14:44.116 --> 14:48.621
Then he got a ton of mileage out of it. He
told it at every family dinner party for years.

14:48.656 --> 14:50.623
Then when I started telling
my boyfriend, it was,

14:50.658 --> 14:54.093
"You can't do that, baby.
You're a girl."

14:54.627 --> 14:58.130
By the time I got to the
academy, it was every guy saying,

14:58.165 --> 15:01.384
"You don't belong here, bitch.
You're a girl."

15:01.419 --> 15:04.603
But I had really thick skin
by then, you know?

15:05.137 --> 15:10.643
And, uh, I learned how to cry when nobody
was looking, and I did a ton of sit-ups.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.646
I thought I was
gonna break my back.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.148
But I became a firefighter.

15:18.651 --> 15:23.656
And then when I actually get assigned to
a regular house and start doing the job,

15:23.691 --> 15:26.158
what would be
my next course of action?

15:26.659 --> 15:30.127
I'm gonna start banging
a guy in my crew.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.665
And then I'm gonna fall in love
with a guy in my crew.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.633
You know, 'cause he's hot
and sweet, and...

15:35.668 --> 15:41.173
I think on some level I thought
he needed me... because I'm a girl.

15:43.175 --> 15:47.680
I had to come all this way to
learn that my father was right?

15:49.181 --> 15:52.650
I'm just a girl, you know?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.187
I don't have anybody to blame
but myself.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.025
Hey! I found it.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.361
Thanks, Laura.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.863
You're welcome.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.772
Connor?

16:57.282 --> 16:59.251
Hello?

17:16.268 --> 17:18.270
Connor?

17:34.620 --> 17:36.587
I, uh--

17:36.622 --> 17:41.627
My name is, uh, Tommy,

17:43.929 --> 17:46.663
and, uh,
I'm an alcoholic.

17:46.698 --> 17:52.371
- Hi, Tom.
- I'm also a, uh, fireman.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.375
And, uh, five days ago,

17:56.875 --> 18:01.246
my only son was killed
by a drunk driver,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.582
and...

18:09.054 --> 18:10.989
I don't really give a shit
about anything anymore.

18:47.025 --> 18:50.160
Hey, pal.
I tried your cell.

18:50.195 --> 18:53.398
I tried you at home.
I, uh, figured you'd be here.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.634
I'm not here
to judge you, bro.

18:55.669 --> 18:57.536
Knock yourself out.

19:09.047 --> 19:13.285
Janet's pretty bad.
Yeah.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.623
Started talking crazy
the other night.

19:18.123 --> 19:22.294
She was talking about jumping out the
window so she could be with Connor.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.996
I was about to head home.

19:26.031 --> 19:30.035
I ended up sleeping on the couch with
one eye open. You know what I mean?

19:34.039 --> 19:38.043
The girls, though, man,
uh, they're tough.

19:38.078 --> 19:40.045
They're okay.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.548
But Janet--

19:44.049 --> 19:46.051
Janet's gonna take
a while.

19:51.056 --> 19:53.025
We got the guy, Tommy.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.063
We got him in Maryland.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.567
Still driving the car.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.771
You don't want to know
that story.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.076
I think about it,
and, uh,

20:13.078 --> 20:15.447
it just makes me so angry,
you know?

20:16.815 --> 20:19.318
It turns out this guy,

20:19.818 --> 20:22.037
he's had, like, five D.U.I.'s
in the last three years.

20:22.072 --> 20:24.256
And the thing is, he used
to work at the D.A.'s office,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.258
so he's got friends
everywhere, you know?

20:26.758 --> 20:28.560
He's walked every time.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.829
I started poking my nose
around a little.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.600
People are telling me
he's gonna skate on this one.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.301
Can you believe that?

20:37.336 --> 20:39.738
He smiled for the cameras
the last time he got off.

20:40.105 --> 20:44.543
They gave him 60 hours
of community service.

20:44.578 --> 20:47.444
They're holding him
down in Baltimore.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.780
We're sending a couple of guys
down there on Friday to pick him up.

20:49.815 --> 20:54.152
They'll be bringing him back up to
Hoboken sometime early Friday night.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.953
We're gonna book him,
set bail,

20:55.988 --> 20:59.992
and after that,
it's anybody's ball game.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.750
Find out what time
the train comes in on Friday.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.352
You sure?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.521
I'm sure.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.690
Done.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.340
Yeah?
It's me.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.527
I cannot come over
right now.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.622
No, listen.
I'm at Debbie's.

21:54.657 --> 21:56.682
Wah, wah, wah!
Boo-hoo-hoo!

21:57.182 --> 22:00.185
You're such a drama queen. You
should get out of my apartment!

22:00.220 --> 22:03.654
I'm scared. She's out of
control, and I don't know--

22:03.689 --> 22:07.959
Holy shit!
Give me the address.

22:08.193 --> 22:12.264
I'm a little confused...
right now.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.267
I mean, well,
I'm confused most of the time,

22:15.302 --> 22:18.770
but right now
I'm-I'm super confused.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.239
See, when I was little,
it was simple, you know?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.241
There was heaven and there
was hell. And if you were good,

22:24.276 --> 22:27.744
you went to heaven, and if you
were bad, you went... the other way.

22:27.779 --> 22:32.751
And if you were, like, an innocent child
or-or a baby who choked on something,

22:32.786 --> 22:34.786
you went--
you went to limbo.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.753
Remember limbo?

22:36.788 --> 22:39.756
Yeah. And then you guys
canceled limbo.

22:39.791 --> 22:44.261
And now, I just-- I don't--
I got this dead kid on my hands.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.299
And I got this live kid who-who's
telling me that there is no heaven,

22:47.799 --> 22:52.304
there's only dirt,
apparently, and--

22:54.306 --> 22:57.309
I don't know. I'm just-- I'm
getting some mixed signals here.

22:57.809 --> 23:02.314
So, I figured the best thing
to do is go right to the source.

23:02.349 --> 23:06.318
Think you could...
help me out here?

23:06.353 --> 23:08.320
Show me a sign?

23:22.801 --> 23:24.803
All righty then.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.421
Holy shit.
I'm sorry.

23:44.456 --> 23:47.459
I didn't-- Sorry.
That was--

23:47.494 --> 23:49.426
Oh, my God! That's--

23:49.461 --> 23:51.797
Thank you, thank you.

23:53.298 --> 23:56.301
Thank God you're here. Listen,
I don't even know what I did.

23:56.336 --> 23:59.304
She totally snapped. She
just went absolutely ape shit.

23:59.339 --> 24:01.523
And now she's back there
cooling off and--

24:01.558 --> 24:03.708
Hmm. Well, shit. Well, look who's here.

24:04.009 --> 24:07.446
Now it's a goddamn party.
You gotta leave her alone.

24:07.481 --> 24:09.780
My house, my rules,
prick.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.750
Do you see what I'm
talking about? Shut up!

24:14.219 --> 24:16.221
Do me a favor. Just go upstairs
for a couple minutes, okay?

24:16.655 --> 24:20.192
Yeah, and clean the bathroom while
you're up there. It's a goddamn mess!

24:21.660 --> 24:25.130
She had to call you, her
knight in shining armor. Shit.

24:27.532 --> 24:30.569
- You gotta stop hitting her.
- Don't tell me what to do, slick.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.442
What? You want a taste?

24:44.683 --> 24:46.551
I'm petrified.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.793
Do it again.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.304
One more time.

25:15.714 --> 25:18.550
Oh, shit.

25:20.051 --> 25:22.888
Are you okay?

25:26.224 --> 25:30.228
I'm-- I'm gonna go get a drink. Um,
your boyfriend's falling apart in there.

25:30.263 --> 25:33.732
You might want
to check it out.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.591
We got a guy hanging out
a window up on exposure "B".

25:59.791 --> 26:02.794
The first two companies are having
trouble getting to the fire floor.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.298
Oh, yeah.

26:07.799 --> 26:10.267
Hey, asshole, what are you
doing? Put your helmet on.

26:10.302 --> 26:14.306
Pick up your gloves. Forget it.
Give me a size-up. Unbelievable.

26:14.341 --> 26:16.773
Nice to have you back,
Tommy. Nice to be back.

26:16.808 --> 26:20.779
Thirteen. Twelve, shithead.
Move. Let's go, Probie, now!

26:23.148 --> 26:25.582
Nils, where's that saw?

26:25.617 --> 26:28.086
Nils, come on. Fire up. Let's
start some venting over here, okay?

26:28.486 --> 26:30.822
We're looking for something
to tie up to, okay?

26:31.122 --> 26:32.991
Stevie, I'm gonna need you
set up right here.

26:33.491 --> 26:35.660
Guys, something's going on
down there. Heads up! Heads up!

26:35.994 --> 26:38.330
-Guys, anything. We got nothing. What do we do?
-I don't know. Patty Brown.

26:38.365 --> 26:40.964
Patty Brown.
Probie, get on the ground.

26:40.999 --> 26:44.169
You guys got it. Stevie, right here.
You ready, Spider-Man? You and me.

26:44.204 --> 26:47.339
-Let's go. You and me.
-On the floor, on the floor. Tie him up, Tommy.

26:47.374 --> 26:50.942
All right. See you boys
on the other side.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.680
See you later.
Good luck.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.989
Go. Go. Nice.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.460
Nice. Go. Go.
Good boy, Franco.

27:08.827 --> 27:12.697
Did you see that--
I can't see him.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.536
Sir, relax. Will you relax? We're here to
help you. No, no, no! Don't, don't, don't!

27:18.870 --> 27:21.873
- Good! Good!
- Good. Good job, Franco. That's it.

27:22.207 --> 27:25.210
No! Don't, don't, don't, don't! Don't,
don't. Sir-- Sir, please, please.

27:25.245 --> 27:27.646
I'm here to help you. It's a strong
rope. You're gonna knock me off!

27:27.681 --> 27:30.048
It's a strong rope. I'm not gonna
knock you off. Don't touch me.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.717
Sir, I need you
to stay calm down there!

27:33.018 --> 27:35.387
It's okay. Please, sir.
Please, just-- Don't-- Don't--

27:35.720 --> 27:38.388
- Man over!
- Get it!

27:38.423 --> 27:41.643
Damn it! Franco, are you good?

27:41.678 --> 27:44.828
Oh, Jesus!

27:44.863 --> 27:47.899
And he's in. We got him. We
got him. Good job, everybody.

27:50.869 --> 27:54.337
My balls! My balls!
Off! Off! Off!

27:54.372 --> 27:57.007
Battalion 15 to 62 roof.
We got another one.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.811
Another what? Another civilian
hanging out of a window.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.746
Same side,
southern exposure.

28:02.213 --> 28:05.417
Tommy, check on that for me. Listen,
I'm gonna need a new rope up here.

28:05.452 --> 28:08.653
- Can't help you there.
- It's a negative on the rope?

28:09.154 --> 28:11.473
We got two floors below
the fire floor fully involved.

28:11.508 --> 28:13.757
Can't get a rope to you.
You have to use the same one.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.528
Yeah, copy that. Pull this
in. We gotta do it again, guys.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.930
Follow me over here.
Lou, I'll go.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.932
No.
I'm the lightest one.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.400
No, you're not going. But
the rope's been compromised.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.604
I'm not sending a girl over the roof of an
11-story building, as much as I'd like to.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.505
I'm going. Now back off. He's going.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.242
We're gonna chop right here,
Tommy. I'm gonna grab my ax.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.910
- Now, sweetheart--
- Battalion 15 to 62 roof.

28:33.945 --> 28:36.948
What's going on, ladies? You got
a sewing circle going on up there?

28:36.983 --> 28:39.635
Come on. Talk to me.
Tommy's getting roped up.

28:39.670 --> 28:42.287
He's getting ready to go.
Just give us a second.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.626
Right? See ya.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.602
Easy. Easy.

29:01.639 --> 29:04.441
Hey, sweetheart, come here.
Come here now. I can't.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.812
My mom, she's at the store. She
told me not to leave the apartment.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.082
No, no. Come on, sweetheart.
You can do it. I can't.

29:10.117 --> 29:12.317
Yeah. Come on, darling.
Come on. Come on. I can't.

29:12.352 --> 29:15.170
Out ya go. Attagirl.
Good girl.

29:15.205 --> 29:17.989
Okay, he's got her.
He's got her.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.106
Here you go, sweetheart. You're
gonna go with these guys, okay?

29:35.141 --> 29:38.493
You're all right.
Good girl.

29:38.528 --> 29:41.846
Okay. Come on.
Good girl. Yeah.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.850
-Good girl.
- You okay?

29:46.151 --> 29:48.952
All right!

29:48.987 --> 29:50.522
Shit!

29:50.822 --> 29:52.822
- Aw, shit!
- Oh!

29:52.857 --> 29:56.960
- He's-He's got him!
He's got him! He's got him.

29:56.995 --> 30:01.498
Oh, Davey, I'm getting too old
for this kind of bullshit.

30:01.533 --> 30:05.370
Hey, you certainly earned your
money today-- all 15 cents of it.

30:05.405 --> 30:08.338
Yes, I did. What's going
on? You want to grab a bite?

30:08.373 --> 30:11.376
No, I'd love to, but I gotta
go shopping, get some new duds.

30:11.411 --> 30:13.343
Got a big date tomorrow
night. Oh, really?

30:13.378 --> 30:16.881
Oh, yeah! Yeah. That huge explosion
you're gonna hear tomorrow night,

30:16.916 --> 30:19.849
about 8:15 or so, that's
gonna be Lou getting it on.

30:19.884 --> 30:22.136
Oh, I'll light a candle. It's
nice to hear your voice, Tom.

30:22.171 --> 30:24.389
Thanks, pal. Now shut up
and get the hell out of here.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.891
You get the hell out of here.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.893
Good luck.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.863
Hey, "T".

30:33.898 --> 30:37.302
I cannot tell you how sorry I am to
hear about your situation. Thanks.

30:37.337 --> 30:41.239
How you doin'? I'm doing
all right, you know?

30:41.274 --> 30:43.206
Listen, why don't you
take three days?

30:43.241 --> 30:45.743
Go on a little bender. Get
it out of your system. Hmm?

30:45.778 --> 30:48.211
No, no, no. I'm-I'm fine.
I'm-I'm--

30:48.246 --> 30:50.713
That's not what I heard.
Listen, take the time.

30:50.748 --> 30:55.220
I already put in for it,
okay? You can thank me later.

30:55.255 --> 30:59.691
I-I'd actually...
rather work, Chief.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.200
Hello?

31:09.400 --> 31:12.837
Hey, you're not gonna believe this.
I just had a little chat with Perolli.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.475
- I think the prick's still having me followed.
- Yeah? How do you know that?

31:16.510 --> 31:20.078
He comes up to me and says, "Hey, why
don't you go on a bender for three days?"

31:20.113 --> 31:23.448
I go, "No, I'm fine." And then he
says, uh, "That's not what I heard."

31:23.483 --> 31:25.882
I mean, he's gotta have
somebody tailing me, right?

31:25.917 --> 31:28.953
I've been keeping an eye out. I
haven't seen any familiar faces.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.322
Hold on there, Tommy.
I got another call.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.691
Yeah. Yeah. I'll wait.

31:52.543 --> 31:55.546
Tom, you there?
Tommy? Tom?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.573
Son of a bitch!
I knew it was you!

32:05.608 --> 32:07.790
What are you doing?
I knew it was you!

32:07.825 --> 32:11.162
Get your hands off me. You
lied to me, you son of a bitch!

32:11.496 --> 32:14.499
I'm betting I punch in the number right
here, and Perolli's number comes up!

32:14.534 --> 32:16.701
I don't know what you're talking
about. I told you the guy called me.

32:16.736 --> 32:18.968
Yeah, you didn't tell me
you call him, asshole!

32:19.003 --> 32:23.474
Explain yourself! What do you want me to
say, huh? All right. The guy called me.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.843
You want me to let you go slipping
and sliding away like the last time?

32:26.144 --> 32:28.144
You know he's my biggest enemy
in the goddamn firehouse!

32:28.179 --> 32:31.399
You asked me to sponsor you! I'm
trying to be responsible! Really?

32:31.434 --> 32:34.619
Yeah. The guy calls me, I told
him how you were doing, all right?

32:34.986 --> 32:38.589
Guess what? You're dead
to me. You're dead to me!

32:38.624 --> 32:42.158
-Yeah, but it worked, didn't it?
-It worked how, huh?

32:42.193 --> 32:43.995
For the first time, you're up
in front of a group of drunks,

32:44.030 --> 32:46.497
and you use your real name,
not that you have to.

32:46.998 --> 32:50.868
First time, you got up there and told 'em not
only what you are, you told 'em who you are.

32:51.169 --> 32:54.706
Yeah, you know what? Go to hell,
you two-faced, Judas piece of shit!

32:54.741 --> 32:58.174
No, I ain't Judas! More
like Peter the apostle, pal.

32:58.209 --> 33:00.712
I was trying to be there for you,
trying to be a foundation, a rock.

33:01.212 --> 33:03.548
What the hell are you talking
about? Did you take a drink today?

33:03.881 --> 33:06.217
I haven't had a drink
in three months, asshole.

33:06.551 --> 33:08.553
So you're feeling a
little angry, huh? Yeah.

33:08.588 --> 33:10.555
You feeling a little hurt?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:10.590 --> 33:12.607
You feeling betrayed?
Goddamn right I am!

33:12.642 --> 33:15.185
Yeah, well, congratulations.
You're feeling.

33:15.220 --> 33:17.694
And you're feeling
because you're sober.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.631
Because a piece of you
bought into the program.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.499
You went to meetings,
and a piece of it stuck.

33:23.534 --> 33:27.038
Now I don't give a goddamn what you do.
I don't care where you go, what you do.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.874
I did my part, pal.
The rest is up to you.

33:45.990 --> 33:49.994
This would've been a hell of a lot
easier if you weren't here like I asked.

33:51.996 --> 33:54.397
All right, listen.
I just wanted to tell you--

33:54.432 --> 33:57.101
I wanted to explain to you--
There's nothing to say.

34:00.104 --> 34:01.904
I told him to go inside
and get his helmet.

34:01.939 --> 34:05.076
Yeah, but you didn't check
to make sure he did, Tommy.

34:05.276 --> 34:09.313
You told him to do it, and then you
stuck your head up your own goddamn ass,

34:09.348 --> 34:11.716
where it happily resides
most of the time.

34:11.751 --> 34:14.085
Except, of course,
when you're fighting fires,

34:14.120 --> 34:16.387
and then you are
the goddamn man.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.190
Then you are the cock
of the goddamn walk.

34:20.625 --> 34:23.159
You save strangers.

34:23.194 --> 34:26.197
You save a strange little girl
on a window ledge...

34:26.697 --> 34:28.699
filled with smoke and flames
10 stories high,

34:29.100 --> 34:31.335
but you can't keep your eye
on your own son...

34:31.370 --> 34:33.571
while he rides his bike
down the goddamn block!

34:35.505 --> 34:38.810
Jesus Christ!

34:46.451 --> 34:49.454
I'm gonna miss you.
Yeah.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.456
Here, sweetie.
Bye.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.458
Good-bye, Daddy.
Sweetie.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.428
Okay, Katy, come on.
Katy.

34:58.463 --> 35:02.216
Honey-- Katy, come on.
Let's go, honey. Let's go.

35:02.251 --> 35:05.970
Here you go, sweetie,
huh? Thank you. Good-bye.

35:11.476 --> 35:16.481
Tomorrow afternoon, 5:30,
Hoboken, Track 5.

35:16.516 --> 35:18.483
I'll take care
of the girls for you.

35:27.992 --> 35:31.812
No way. It's not gonna happen.
I'm not letting you kill anybody.

35:31.847 --> 35:35.633
Dad, the guy's a scumbag. He's
walked before. He'll do it again.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.736
You're not killing him.
I am.

35:39.036 --> 35:42.405
Shit.
I'm the boy's grandfather.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.193
You do this,
and you lose everything, Tom--

35:46.228 --> 35:49.947
your job, your freedom,
your-- your girls.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.184
I'm an old man.

35:53.384 --> 35:54.952
So they put me in jail
for the rest of my life.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.456
That could be two weeks
for all we know.

35:58.491 --> 36:01.860
Could be one week.
Thanks, asshole.

36:01.895 --> 36:05.229
Look, you're not
doing this, Mike.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.498
If this is gonna go down,
I'm the shooter.

36:07.698 --> 36:10.935
- I had first dibs.
- Did you just say dibs?

36:12.403 --> 36:14.370
You're, like, what,
110 years old?

36:14.405 --> 36:18.910
We send you in to do the job, you fall
asleep. You wake up a half hour later.

36:18.945 --> 36:22.831
You go to scratch your leg, and you
shoot yourself right in the balls.

36:22.866 --> 36:26.717
I killed four Germans in World War
II, and one of them hand-to-hand.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.137
And that's the four I know
about. It could be more.

36:29.172 --> 36:32.549
Four? You know how many
gooks I killed in 'Nam?

36:32.584 --> 36:35.892
Vietnam. Vietnam can kiss
my fat Irish ass.

36:35.927 --> 36:39.730
I fought in a goddamn war
we won, for Christ's sakes.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.033
Oh, yeah? Fifty thousand
of our guys dead...

36:42.400 --> 36:45.803
versus two million
Viet-goddamn-cong, and we lost?

36:45.838 --> 36:48.070
Not in my goddamn book!
Yeah--

36:48.105 --> 36:51.108
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop
it! Knock it off! Dad, sit down!

36:51.609 --> 36:53.110
Are you taking your
medication? Sit down!

36:53.611 --> 36:56.197
Sorry, Tom.
He started it.

36:56.232 --> 36:58.783
- I don't care!
- Christ!

37:00.785 --> 37:03.287
Well, you're right about
what you were saying.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.790
I-I didn't think
of the girls.

37:05.825 --> 37:09.193
Yeah.
Let me do it, Tom.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.063
What?
Look at me.

37:12.463 --> 37:15.132
My life's a mess.
I got nothin'.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.767
I got no wife,
no house, no kids.

37:17.802 --> 37:20.371
Everything I've ever touched
in life's turned to shit.

37:20.605 --> 37:24.976
Let me do one good thing.
Let me do it for Connor.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.211
I don't know, Teddy.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.983
Please, Tommy, for me.
I need this.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.320
You can get a gun
from Miami Mike?

37:36.355 --> 37:38.990
I'll call him right now.

37:45.162 --> 37:49.166
I have to get home, Bud.
There are dishes in the sink.

37:49.201 --> 37:51.133
I'll take care of them.

37:51.168 --> 37:55.239
Look, if you don't like it
here, you can always come home.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.206
Just give it a try,
all right?

37:57.241 --> 38:02.213
I don't like this school.
I know. Look, babe.

38:02.248 --> 38:04.448
I have to go, babe.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.251
No, no, don't leave.

38:07.685 --> 38:12.723
Sweetie, you got a nice room here, and
there's plenty of nice people to talk to.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.660
It's not right, Bud.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.928
It's just not right.

38:19.196 --> 38:21.163
No, it's not.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.467
But we'll just have to do
the best we can, huh?

38:26.837 --> 38:28.839
Oh!

38:36.547 --> 38:38.449
Try not to forget me, huh?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.562
Good-bye, Jerry.

38:59.236 --> 39:01.806
So, are we gonna meet this chick
or what? All in good time, boys.

39:01.841 --> 39:05.309
All in good time. Hey, fellas.
Glad to see you're all here.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.080
Keep it short, Chief, all right? We
got places to go and people to lay with.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.550
- I just thought I'd come down and congratulate you.
- Why? What'd we do this time?

39:12.883 --> 39:14.884
You should be proud of
yourselves. Mission accomplished.

39:14.919 --> 39:19.457
I'm not saying I wanted her here either, but
leave it to you guys to drive her the hell out.

39:19.492 --> 39:22.124
What are you talking about? Miles.

39:22.159 --> 39:24.912
Laura. She's gone. She asked
for a transfer out a week ago.

39:24.947 --> 39:27.665
Told me not to say anything
till the end of shift today.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.632
Uh, Chief,
what are you talking about?

39:29.667 --> 39:32.937
She transferred. Where did she
go? How the hell would I know?

39:32.972 --> 39:35.272
Nicely done.

39:38.642 --> 39:42.146
Uh, Lou, you think I
could, um-- Yeah, go.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.282
I never saw it coming.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.784
I'm not an idiot.
I was completely fooled.

39:48.819 --> 39:52.356
How long did you know her?
Uh, a little over a month.

39:52.391 --> 39:56.794
How'd you meet her?
An ad... on the Internet.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.296
An escort service.

40:00.331 --> 40:03.367
Hell, she was a hooker.
Let's call a spade a spade.

40:03.402 --> 40:06.370
We... hit it off.

40:06.871 --> 40:10.840
She said she wanted to
quit, but couldn't afford to.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.878
Said she could buy her way out if she
had enough money to give to her pimp.

40:13.913 --> 40:16.846
I gave her $18,000.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.884
That's half of everything
I had saved.

40:20.885 --> 40:23.352
Did she give you a name?

40:23.387 --> 40:27.391
She had a couple-- a working
name and a regular name.

40:27.426 --> 40:30.359
She told me
her name was Candy.

40:30.394 --> 40:34.899
Who knows if that's real? Mmm.
If it makes you feel any better,

40:35.399 --> 40:37.868
you're not the first guy
she's done this to.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.650
All right.
Mm-hmm.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.152
Track 5.
I know.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.119
Okay. Don't forget.

40:57.154 --> 41:01.659
I'll, uh-- I'll pull around to
the front entrance, you guys,

41:01.694 --> 41:03.661
after you do the deed,
come through those doors.

41:04.161 --> 41:06.697
I'll be right there.
Right.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.534
All right.
Come on. Get out.

41:10.835 --> 41:14.705
Teddy, thanks.
Glad to do it.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.995
Laura! Laura, open up!

41:22.030 --> 41:26.081
Laura!
Can I help you?

41:26.116 --> 41:29.169
Uh, yeah. I'm-I'm looking
for Laura. Is she here?

41:29.204 --> 41:32.188
No, she's gone. She moved.
I'm taking over her place.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.526
Uh, I'm sorry. What do you mean,
she's gone? Where did she go?

41:35.561 --> 41:37.862
Oh, I'm not supposed
to give out that information.

41:38.229 --> 41:41.098
Please, ma'am? I'm very close to
her. I need to know where she is.

41:41.133 --> 41:44.834
Are you Franco?
Yes. Yes, I'm-I'm Franco.

41:44.869 --> 41:48.272
She said you'd be here. I'm
really not supposed to tell you.

41:48.572 --> 41:51.474
Look-- Please, ma--
Where is she?

41:51.509 --> 41:55.379
Listen, bro.
Let it go. She's moved on.

41:56.914 --> 41:59.917
Look-- Look, please,
could I have her phone number?

41:59.952 --> 42:02.486
A forwarding address?

42:13.163 --> 42:15.766
Karma.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.234
Yeah.

42:18.269 --> 42:22.706
All the times you drove
drunk. I never killed anybody.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.107
Pure blind luck.

42:25.142 --> 42:28.646
Uh-huh. Yeah. Or maybe
it was just, uh, you know,

42:28.681 --> 42:30.581
part of your old man's plan, you know?

42:30.948 --> 42:34.984
Maybe it's his goddamn
master goddamn plan, okay?

42:35.019 --> 42:38.772
You know the one I'm talking about? The
one where my innocent son gets killed,

42:38.807 --> 42:42.526
and the son of a bitch who did the deed
gets to walk around a free man, huh?

42:42.561 --> 42:46.330
You know what that plan is, huh?
You know anything about it? Huh?

42:46.630 --> 42:48.198
You want to tell me,
asshole, huh?

42:48.699 --> 42:52.402
You need to hang on to some
hope, Tommy. Some faith.

42:52.437 --> 42:56.106
I'm sorry, pal. Hope, faith.
Tank's empty on that count.

42:56.440 --> 43:00.010
Is this how you want to
remember your only son, Tommy?

43:00.045 --> 43:02.012
With a bullet
in a train station?

43:04.815 --> 43:06.884
I don't think it is.

43:10.387 --> 43:12.256
Remember his laugh?

43:14.625 --> 43:17.928
Remember how tiny he was
when he was born?

43:19.229 --> 43:21.165
Remember how he slept
in the crook of your arm...

43:21.200 --> 43:23.500
when you brought him home
from the hospital?

43:27.805 --> 43:30.107
Remember how he loved you?

43:30.341 --> 43:33.911
Remember how he always
trusted you to do right by him?

43:35.279 --> 43:38.148
Is this right, Tommy?

43:47.157 --> 43:49.660
Shit!

43:51.362 --> 43:56.899
Get the wheel
Let's go for a ride

43:56.934 --> 44:01.705
If you're trouble
then I'll follow you down

44:11.015 --> 44:13.515
Last night

44:13.550 --> 44:17.821
I saw the strangest light

44:17.856 --> 44:22.092
I wanna see it again

44:32.569 --> 44:37.508
I'm wide awake

44:39.410 --> 44:43.831
Somebody put a

44:43.866 --> 44:48.252
Gun in my face

44:52.256 --> 44:58.228
Go ahead, I said, Lorraine

44:59.730 --> 45:02.698
And then we're gonna

45:02.733 --> 45:07.938
Get the wheel
Let's go for a ride

45:08.439 --> 45:14.445
If you're trouble then
I'll follow you down, baby

45:22.419 --> 45:23.954
Last night

45:24.455 --> 45:28.709
Last night was all right

45:28.744 --> 45:32.963
I wanna see you again

45:41.739 --> 45:44.606
Go ahead

45:44.641 --> 45:48.779
I said, Lorraine

45:49.847 --> 45:53.283
And then we're gonna

45:53.650 --> 45:58.122
Get the wheel
Let's go for a ride

45:58.622 --> 46:04.928
If you're trouble then
I'll follow you down, baby

46:10.968 --> 46:14.770
Last night

46:14.805 --> 46:18.675
Last night was all right

46:18.710 --> 46:22.546
I wanna see you again

47:16.533 --> 47:17.968
Cloudland.
