12:11.772 --> 12:13.649
Yes, we'll send the eye.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.111
I'm sure he'll offer us
a fair reward.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.821
And then we'll
make him double it.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.698
ALL: Huh?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.950
Well, why can't I be
greedy once in a while?

12:23.033 --> 12:27.371
Bobo. My beautiful Bobo.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.958
I promise I'll never
leave you behind again.

12:31.041 --> 12:31.959
(clears throat)

12:32.042 --> 12:33.252
Oh, yes.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.421
Naturally, I can't pay you
much of a reward

12:35.504 --> 12:37.214
because I'm
strapped for cash.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.382
(creaking)

12:42.470 --> 12:45.723

place is falling apart.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.975
But I'm sure we can come
to an understanding.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.101
Yes, sir.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.854
(thinking) <i>Reject the first offer.</i>
<i>Reject the first offer.</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:53.522
May I offer you a drink?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.692
Sorry, Burns. No deal.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.361
Don't worry, Smithers.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.030
He's playing hardball now,

13:01.113 --> 13:03.157
but it won't take him
long to crack.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.327

13:06.410 --> 13:08.788
I gotta call Burns.
I gotta call Burns!

13:08.871 --> 13:11.499
Maybe I can still
get that drink.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.959
Dad, the longer he has to wait,
the more he'll pay.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.754
Right. That makes sense.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.297
Yah!

13:18.380 --> 13:20.800
No! No! Let me go!

13:23.177 --> 13:26.013

crawling back.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.848
-How much do you want?
-$1 million

13:27.932 --> 13:31.018
and three Hawaiian islands.
Good ones. Not the leper one.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.437

13:33.521 --> 13:36.065

14:05.970 --> 14:07.972

14:08.055 --> 14:09.890

14:12.893 --> 14:13.894

14:15.396 --> 14:17.523

14:17.606 --> 14:20.317

-Son. You gotta help me.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.695
I hit three people
on the way over here,

14:22.778 --> 14:25.322
and I don't
have any insurance.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.032
So how's about you?

14:32.162 --> 14:33.664
Excellent shot, Smithers.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.083

his children more than money.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.484

for not taking Mr. Burns' money.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.657
I don't hate you.
I'm proud of you.
