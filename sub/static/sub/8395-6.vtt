WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.687
SARAH'S A BIG PART
OF MY LIFE.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.608
SHE'S GONNA BE
A PART OF RUBY'S.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.483
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.135
THIS OLIVER ROME--
HE'S GONE.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.273
WE HAVE NO MONEY NOW COMING
INTO THE LUNCHEONE'ITE,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.550
AND THEN, WHEN I GET HOME, JASMINE IS, LIKE,

00:13.590 --> 00:15.148
"WHERE'VE YOU BEEN",
YOU KNOW,

00:15.180 --> 00:17.421
"ARE YOU RIDING A MOTORCYCLE"? WHO CARES?

00:17.460 --> 00:19.143
[Max]
DYLAN CURRENTLY
LIKES ME AT A 2 1/2.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.523
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOUR ADVICE IS
ENOUGH TO BRING THAT UP TO A 5.

00:22.570 --> 00:25.607
MY LIFE IS, LIKE, COMPLETELY OVER AS I KNOW IT.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.562
YOU KIND OF DID IT
OUT OF ORDER,

00:27.610 --> 00:30.465
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
THAT YOUR LIFE'S OVER.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.759
WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS, LIKE, A TOY?

00:38.790 --> 00:39.961
[Drew]
THIS IS A CRAZY SOCK.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.513
[Woman]
ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?

00:41.550 --> 00:43.586
DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC COLOR
SCHEME IN MIND,

00:43.620 --> 00:44.587
OR ANYTHING?

00:44.630 --> 00:45.619
COLOR SCHEME--NO, NO.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.696
WE DON'T JUST--WE'RE NOT--
YEAH, AT THAT POINT.

00:47.730 --> 00:50.142
WE'RE JUST SORT OF, LIKE,
"WHAT DO WE EVEN--

00:50.180 --> 00:52.182
-YEAH, WHAT DOES SHE NEED?
-WHERE DO WE START"?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.448
WELL, YOU COULD START
WITH THE CRIB.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.252
THIS IS
A VERY POPULAR MODEL.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.178
OKAY.

00:57.220 --> 01:00.189
YEAH, THIS ONE LOOKS--
THIS ONE LOOKS NICE. RIGHT?

01:00.230 --> 01:01.777
SO IT COMES WITH ALL THE
STUFF IN IT, AND IT'S--

01:01.820 --> 01:04.436
OH, NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TO ADD THE MATTRESS,

01:04.470 --> 01:05.539
THE BEDDING,
THE BUMPER.

01:05.580 --> 01:06.740
I'D PASS ON THE MOBILE.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.405
THEY SAY IT KEEPS THE
BABY FROM SLEEPING,

01:08.440 --> 01:09.748
WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU'LL WANT.

01:09.790 --> 01:11.098
YEAH.TRUST ME.

01:11.140 --> 01:15.304
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A CHANGING TABLE,
A ROCKER, OF COURSE,

01:15.350 --> 01:16.897
A BJORN DIAPER BAG,

01:16.930 --> 01:20.240
DIAPER GENIE--DEFINITELY
DON'T WANT TO SKIP ON THAT.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.419
AND THEN
THERE'S THE STROLLER.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.213
I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE ORIGAMI
STROLLER MORE HIGHLY.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.694
IT'S GOT
A CELL PHONE CHARGER,

01:26.740 --> 01:32.326
LCD DISPLAY, DAYTIME RUNNING
LIGHTS, PATHWAY LIGHTS, AND--

01:32.360 --> 01:34.225
-OH, MY GOSH.
-AH! OH, MY GOD!

01:38.960 --> 01:40.507
WOW, OKAY, THAT WAS
REALLY SOMETHING.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.577
I COULD--I COULD SET YOU
GUYS UP WITH A REGISTRY.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.575
I TAKE IT THIS IS
YOUR FIRST BABY?

01:44.620 --> 01:46.406
-YEAH, IT'S HER FIRST BABY.
-IT'S MY BABY.

01:46.450 --> 01:47.758
-YEAH, IT'S HER BABY.
-IT'S ONLY MY BABY. HE'S NOT--

01:47.790 --> 01:49.678
-WE'RE NOT BOTH--
-THAT'S MY BROTHER.

01:49.730 --> 01:50.754
HE'S YOUNG.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.892
-I'M SORRY.
-BUT ANWVAY--

01:51.930 --> 01:53.409
I DON'T THINK
WE NEED THE REGISTRY.

01:53.450 --> 01:54.417
I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA LOOK
AROUND FOR A MINUTE.

01:54.450 --> 01:55.485
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
DO SOME LIGHT BROWSING.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.487
-BUT THANK YOU.
-BUT, YES,

01:56.530 --> 01:57.656
WE'LL THINK ABOUT THIS ONE.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.739
IT'S--WHOA,
THAT'S JUST SO CRAZY.

02:01.770 --> 02:02.759
THANK YOU.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.459
IT'S LIKE--IT'S MORE THAN
MY APARTMENT.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.492
-WE CAN GO TO TARGET OR--
-ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST GO.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.606
YOU SPEAK VERY CLEARLY
AND LOUDLY,

02:16.650 --> 02:18.572
AND YOU SMELL
LIKE BABY POWDER.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.440
UM...WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:20.480 --> 02:22.823
IT SAYS ON WIKIHOW'S TIPS
FOR TEENAGE BOYS

02:22.860 --> 02:25.488
THAT I SHOULD COMPLIMENT YOU
IN ORDER TO SHOW MY INTEREST.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.203
WELL, I AM LOUD.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.751
THAT'S FOR SURE.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.145
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THOSE.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.621
YOU CAN BE A LITTLE NU'I'I'Y
ABOUT YOUR STUFF, MAX.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.695
[Max]
THAT IS NOT
A COMPLIMENT.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.594
I-I WAS TEASING YOU.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.840
YOU'RE FUNNY
WITHOUT TRYING TO BE,

02:47.890 --> 02:50.438
AND YOU HAVE NICE EYES,
YOU KNOW,

02:50.480 --> 02:52.948
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY
LOOK DIRECTLY AT SOMEONE.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.160
THANK YOU.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.727
YOU KNOW YOUR PARENTS
HAVE WALKED BY, LIKE,
FIVE TIMES.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.443
EXACTLY SIX TIMES.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.928
-CLOSE CALL.
-GOOD ONE.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.210
[Sarah]
LOOK IT-- MARSHMALLOW
EGGS--SO CUTE.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.729
YOU CAN'T EAT IT--PUT IT BACK,
'CAUSE IT BREAKS THE SEAL.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.761
I HATE MOM.
SHE'S THE WORST.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.459
WHAT?
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.365
I WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.987
RUBY, LOOK, YOU'RE ALWAYS
WELCOME TO STAY WITH ME.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.021
IT'S JUST LIKE
DOES SHE EXPECT ME

03:25.060 --> 03:26.709
TO, LIKE, NEVER HAVE FUN?

03:26.750 --> 03:30.334
WASN'T SHE EVER YOUNG, LIKE,
HOWEVER MANY MILLION YEARS AGO?

03:30.380 --> 03:32.302
SHE JUST--
SHE DOESN'T GET IT.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.683
IT'S JUST--IT'S SO MUCH BETTER
HERE WITH YOU GUYS, IT'S--

03:38.730 --> 03:40.345
UH...
[laughs]

03:40.390 --> 03:41.869
YOU KNOW, RUBY,
YOUR MOM'S YOUR MOM.

03:41.910 --> 03:42.934
THAT'S THE WAY SHE IS.

03:42.980 --> 03:44.732
BUT SHE'S GOT SOME RULES,

03:44.770 --> 03:45.873
AND YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN
TO THEM.

03:45.910 --> 03:49.903
PLEASE, DAD, CAN I
PLEASE STAY WITH YOU?

03:52.470 --> 03:54.392
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, TEXT HER.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.941
TELL HER YOU'RE GONNA
STAY HERE.

03:55.990 --> 03:57.605
GREAT. I ALREADY DID.

03:57.650 --> 03:58.742
THANKS. YOU'RE AWESOME.

03:58.790 --> 03:59.984
ALSO, I SO WON'T
BE IN YOUR HAIR,

04:00.030 --> 04:01.713
BECAUSE TOMORROW NIGHT,

04:01.750 --> 04:04.025
A FRIEND'S HAVING THIS, LIKE,
TOTALLY CASUAL GET-TOGETH ER,

IT'S A GET-TOGETH ER?

04:10.420 --> 04:11.819
YEAH, IT'S REALLY
NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.

04:11.870 --> 04:14.031
I MEAN, IT'S PROBABLY JUST
GONNA BE A FEW OF US,

04:14.080 --> 04:16.480
AND I THOUGHT I COULD JUST GO
FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT

04:16.530 --> 04:18.384
AND HANG OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.738
UH, OH--

04:19.770 --> 04:21.943
YEAH, UM...OKAY, LET ME--

04:28.920 --> 04:30.228
MAYBE NOT--YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.578
-WHY?
-YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME TALK IT
OVER WITH YOUR MOTHER.

04:31.610 --> 04:32.577
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE,
REALLY.

04:32.610 --> 04:35.022
LET ME JUST HAVE A LITTLE
PARENTAL DISCUSSION.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.711
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.751
THESE ARE...
THUMBS UP.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.032
NO, I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT
THE TAX BREAKS IN IBIZA.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.935
-MM-HMM.
-THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLACE

04:45.970 --> 04:47.824
TO RECORD AN ALBUM IF
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
ANYTHING DONE.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.451
NO, NO, LISTEN.
HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.071
IF SHE'S WORKING OUT
NEW MATERIAL,

04:51.110 --> 04:52.554
WHY NOT DO IT HERE
AT THE STUDIO?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.113
THAT WAY,
WHEN SHE STRIKES GOLD,

04:54.150 --> 04:58.564
WE'LL BE HAVING IT
ON RECORDING, YOU KNOW?

04:58.600 --> 04:59.703
[Adam]
OKAY.
OKAY, THANKS A LOT.

04:59.740 --> 05:01.799

05:11.650 --> 05:14.778
LET ME START BY SAYING YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE WORKING HERE.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.400
IT'S MY DREAM JOB,

05:16.450 --> 05:20.136
AND I GET TO HANG OUT
WITH MY TWO COOLEST UNCLES.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.659
THAT'S QUITE
A FRINGE BENEFIT.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.077
-MM-HMM, IT'S TRUE.
-WOW, COME ON.

05:24.110 --> 05:27.386
BUT SERIOUSLY, I FEEL LIKE
I'VE REALLY FLOURISHED HERE,

05:27.430 --> 05:29.944

IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

WITH THEIR ARTISTIC VISIONS
AND EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW.

05:55.590 --> 05:57.694
AMBER, YOU'VE REALLY GROWN
IN THIS POSITION.

05:57.730 --> 05:58.651
I MEAN,

EXCEPT FOR MY SALARY.

06:08.430 --> 06:09.419
RIGHT.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.539
-IT'S A JOKE, BUT--
-SURE.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.185
-BUT YES, UM...
-MM-HMM.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.915
I KNOW--I DO KNOW
THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN SLOW HERE,

06:14.960 --> 06:17.053

06:17.100 --> 06:18.749
-YEAH, WE THINK SO.
-YEAH. OH, THEY WILL.

06:18.790 --> 06:19.575

06:19.620 --> 06:22.578
BUT HONESTLY,
I FEEL SO PASSIONATE,

06:22.620 --> 06:25.407
AND I KNOW THAT THIS PLACE
IS GONNA SKYROCKET,

06:25.450 --> 06:28.101
AND WHEN IT DOES
I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO,

06:28.140 --> 06:31.450
LIKE, WORK TOWARDS BEING A FULL,

06:33.660 --> 06:37.005
AND I JUST FEEL
THAT I SHOULD BE PAID A SALARY

06:37.050 --> 06:40.907
THAT IS COMMENSURATE
WITH MY ABILITIES.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.460
WELL, OF COURSE SHE SHOULD.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.912
-WELL, AMBER, WE--

THANK YOU.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.694
OH.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.196
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG
WE WERE SMALL

07:25.230 --> 07:28.677
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT

07:28.720 --> 07:32.588
AH-AH-AH

07:32.620 --> 07:35.202
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
YOU WOULD SMILE

07:35.240 --> 07:38.869
SO YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT

07:38.900 --> 07:42.552
AH-AH-AH

07:42.600 --> 07:46.240
AND I

07:46.290 --> 07:48.804
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:53.990 --> 07:56.845
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:58.990 --> 08:01.982
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

08:03.750 --> 08:07.208
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG SHE CAN
STAY LOCKED IN HER ROOM, REALLY.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.650
-UH, IT'S--
-I'M BAFFLED.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.851
ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE CAN STAY THERE FOREVER

08:10.900 --> 08:12.060
IF SHE WANTS TO REALLY
MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

08:12.110 --> 08:13.793
SHE'S TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.718
UGH, I DON'T KNOW.

08:15.770 --> 08:17.146
YOU KNOW, 10 I COULD DO.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.694
WHEN SHE WAS 11,
SHE WAS SWEET.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.002
I COULD HANDLE IT.

08:21.050 --> 08:23.974
THIS AGE IS--ALL THE DRAMA,
I'M JUST--

08:24.020 --> 08:25.146
I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS.

08:25.190 --> 08:26.771
NOBODY IS.I'M OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.562
IT'S OUT OF EVERYBODY'S LEAGUE,
THIS AGE.

08:28.610 --> 08:30.669
-TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
-WHAT?

08:30.710 --> 08:32.985

08:35.820 --> 08:37.094
I DIDN'T DO IT PERFECT LY.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.745
WELL, YOU--

08:38.790 --> 08:40.018
YOU SEE WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

08:40.070 --> 08:41.719

08:47.350 --> 08:48.965
-MM-HMM.
-WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

08:49.010 --> 08:50.830
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET RIGHT NOW.

08:50.870 --> 08:52.792
I JUST WANT QUALITY TIME
WITH HER,

08:52.840 --> 08:54.762
AND I CAN'T DO IT WHEN SHE'S
SCREAMING AND YELLING--

08:54.810 --> 08:56.562
LOOK, AT THIS AGE,
SHE'S NOT GONNA VOLUNTEER

08:56.600 --> 08:59.569
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU, SO
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A FUN EVENING.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.976
YOU KNOW, SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS GOING TO A PARTY.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.351
LET'S--WE'LL HAVE A PARTY.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.812
WE CAN, YOU KNOW, ORDER PIZZA
AND HAVE A GAME NIGHT,

09:04.850 --> 09:06.124
OR SOMETHING.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.809
-GAME NIGHT?
-GAME NIGHT, YEAH.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.909
YOU PLAY GAMES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TOO MUCH.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.167
-THAT'S A BRAVERMAN THING.
-IT'S NOT A BRAVERMAN THING.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.679
IT'S JUST
A THING THAT EXISTS.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.028
YOU KNOW, YOU PLAY POKER.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.719
IT'S LIKE THAT, BUT--POKER'S NOT A GAME.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.853
POKER'S--IT'S A--IT'S A--IT'S
AN ART OR A BUSINESS.

09:18.900 --> 09:19.821
-OH, OH.
-IT'S A BUSINESS.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.202
OH, OH, WELL--

09:21.250 --> 09:22.933
I JUST--I JUST FEEL BAD
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

09:22.970 --> 09:24.278
SHE WANTS YOU
TO FEEL BAD.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.242
THAT'S HOW IT IS.
CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.168
LOOK, LIKE I SAID, YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER,

09:28.220 --> 09:31.144
YOU KNOW, SO--

09:31.190 --> 09:33.181
-GAME NIGHT?
-YEAH.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.632
ALL RIGHT.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.012
YOU PLAY FOR MONEY?

09:38.230 --> 09:39.743
-DAD?
-HMM?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.668
I DECIDED I DON'T WANT
TO DO MINI GOLF AND PIZZA

09:41.710 --> 09:43.598
FOR MY BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS YEAR.NO?

09:43.650 --> 09:46.289
WELL, YOUR BIRTHDAY'S IN A
COUPLE OF DAYS, BUDDY. WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO DO?

09:46.340 --> 09:47.716
I WANT TO GO
TO HARRY POTTER WORLD.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.856
YOU PROMISED WE COULD GO.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.721
YOU KNOW, UH,
MAYBE WE CAN GO NEXT YEAR.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.103
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID LAST YEAR.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.800
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT, OKAY?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.353
YES! WE'RE GOING
TO HARRY POTTER WORLD.

10:05.390 --> 10:06.869
NO, NO, NO.
MAYBE.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.013
-SHE SAID, "LOOK INTO IT".
-I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.039
NO, WE'RE GOING!

10:09.090 --> 10:10.944
IT DOESN'T
HURT TO LOOK.

10:15.090 --> 10:16.648
BABE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE STRESSING OUT ABOUT.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.715
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DECLARE A MAJOR

10:17.750 --> 10:19.331
UNTIL, LIKE,
YOUR JUNIOR YEAR.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.304
I UNDERSTAND THAT,

10:21.340 --> 10:24.753
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO DO IT NOW
SO THERE'S SPACE IN THE CLASSES.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.304
[laughing]

10:27.350 --> 10:29.375
YOU'RE TOTALLY
OVER-THINKING THIS.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.412
JUST, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO THE MOST?

10:32.450 --> 10:34.008
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE--

10:34.040 --> 10:35.450
NO, IT'S DEFINITELY
THAT SIMPLE.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.071
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO THE MOST?

10:37.110 --> 10:38.862
I HAVE UNTIL MY JUNIOR YEAR
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

10:38.910 --> 10:40.309
EXACTLY. YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.453
[phone chimes]
EVA WANTS TO GET SUSHI.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.946
I CAN'T--DO YOU WANT TO GO?

10:44.980 --> 10:47.016
I CAN'T GET SUSHI
RIGHT NOW.

10:47.060 --> 10:47.913
OKAY.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.776
NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

10:51.820 --> 10:52.718
YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT?

10:52.750 --> 10:54.923
MY DAD SAYS THAT WHEN YOU
GRADUATE, LIKE,

10:54.960 --> 10:58.020
NOBODY EVEN GOES
NEAR THEIR MAJOR AFTERWARDS.

10:58.070 --> 10:59.890
IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE
ARE CHECKING YOUR TRANSCRIPT

10:59.930 --> 11:02.342
TO MAKE SURE
YOU CHOSE THE RIGHT COURSES,

11:02.380 --> 11:03.859
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
HIRING ANYBODY ANYWAYS,

11:03.900 --> 11:05.868
SO IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.313
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT IT DOES MATTER FOR ME.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.978
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING
TO PLAN AHEAD RIGHT NOW, AND--

11:12.010 --> 11:13.147
OKAY, NO--

11:14.810 --> 11:16.664
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

11:19.290 --> 11:23.294
WHAT ABOUT PHILOSOPHY,
OR RUSSIAN LIT?

11:23.330 --> 11:26.219
YOU LOVED THAT
DOSTOYEVSKY CLASS.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.909
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M THINKING ABOUT ECON.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.927
-ECON?
-YEAH.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.029
YOU HATED ECON.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.379
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE ECON?I KNOW,

11:32.410 --> 11:34.401
BUT MAYBE I JUST DIDN'T GIVE
IT A CHANCE, YOU KNOW?

11:34.450 --> 11:36.168
BUT WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ECON?

11:36.210 --> 11:38.519
ARE YOU GONNA BE A BANKER
OR AN ACCOUNTANT?

11:38.550 --> 11:41.064
YEAH, I MEAN,
MONEY--THAT'S, LIKE,

11:41.110 --> 11:43.249
IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING
TO KNOW ABOUT.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.100
OKAY.

11:45.150 --> 11:47.175
I MEAN,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.802
IT'S YOUR LAST COUPLE YEARS
OF COLLEGE.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.219
IT'S JUST I SEE YOU
AS MORE OF A POET THAN A SUIT.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.728
THANK YOU.
A POET--

11:55.780 --> 11:57.293
I'LL BRING YOU BACK
A TUNA ROLL.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.319
ALL RIGHT.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.266

HIS HEART BEAT.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.880
OKAY, WRAP IT.

12:07.930 --> 12:12.344
ALL RIGHT, DR. NORA,
HOW IS OUR PATIENT
DOING TODAY?

12:12.380 --> 12:16.896
WE'VE NOW HAD TWO DATES.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY

12:16.940 --> 12:18.828

12:18.870 --> 12:19.859
[Kristina]
BUDDY...

12:19.910 --> 12:21.764
-SURE.
-I'M JUST GONNA
WEIGH IN REAL QUICK.

12:21.810 --> 12:23.209
I DON'T THINK
LOOKING ONLINE

12:23.250 --> 12:24.569
IS THE BEST WAY
TO GO ABOUT FIGURING OUT--

12:24.600 --> 12:26.875
SHE ONLY LIKES ME AT 2 1/2,
SO THERE'S NO DESIRE

12:26.910 --> 12:27.569
FOR INTERCOURSE.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.567
-WHAT?
-TMI, DUDE.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.841
OKAY, THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
INTERCOURSING--

12:30.880 --> 12:32.017
FIND OUT IF YOU
CAN SLEEP OVER.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.880
-MAX?
-WHY CAN'T SHE SLEEP OVER?
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.502
I KNOW SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S FINE.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.507
MICAH HAS SLEPT OVER.
WHY CAN'T SHE?

12:37.540 --> 12:38.859
WELL, I'M SURE

20:20.770 --> 20:22.453
I JUST--I CAN'T PUT
MY FINGER ON IT,

20:22.490 --> 20:24.799
BUT WHENEVER SHE'S HERE,
SHE'S PLAYING WITH NORA,

20:24.840 --> 20:27.252

NEXT TO ME AND HANGING OUT,

20:27.290 --> 20:29.042

NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.490

SO, THE THREE OF US CAN GO

23:05.210 --> 23:09.510
FLIGHTS, HOTELS, THEME PARK,
FOOD FOR UNDER $2,000,

23:09.560 --> 23:11.721
AND MY MOM SAID THAT SHE
WOULD WATCH AIDA.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.580
NOW, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS A SPLURGE,

23:13.630 --> 23:15.621
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK--

23:15.670 --> 23:17.149
I THINK WE CAN SWING IT.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.693
HONEY,

23:20.220 --> 23:22.563
WE CAN'T--

WE CAN'T...WHY?

23:24.120 --> 23:28.773
-EVEN CLOSE TO AFFORD THAT.
-WHY NOT?

23:28.820 --> 23:32.051
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.089
WHAT?

23:35.550 --> 23:37.882
I THINK I'M LOSING
MY BUSINESS.

23:40.550 --> 23:43.553
I THINK THE LUNCHEONETTE'S
GOING UNDER.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.552
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MIXING AN ALBUM AND...

23:52.080 --> 23:54.833
YOU GUYS HAD WORK.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.872
THERE'S NOT AN ALBUM.
I'M NOT MIXING AN ALBUM.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.503
THEN WHAT WERE YOU DOING

24:05.650 --> 24:07.641

24:19.040 --> 24:20.928
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN YELL AT ME.

24:20.970 --> 24:22.585
IN FACT, IT WOULD
PROBABLY HELP IF YOU DID.

24:22.630 --> 24:24.791
I DON'T WANT
TO YELL AT YOU.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.172
I JUST DON'T WANT
YOU HIDING FROM ME.

24:34.810 --> 24:36.016
I'M JUST GOING
ROUND AND ROUND,

24:36.060 --> 24:38.984
THINKING ABOUT
IF I LOSE THE LUNCHEONETTE

24:39.020 --> 24:40.988
THEN I HAVE NO INCOME.

24:41.030 --> 24:44.500
IF I HAVE NO INCOME,
WE HAVE TO SELL THE HOUSE.

24:44.550 --> 24:48.065
I'M GONNA LITERALLY LOSE
THE ROOF OVER OUR KIDS' HEADS,

24:48.100 --> 24:49.829
AND THEN, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SELL IT

24:49.860 --> 24:52.067
AND MOVE TO SOME OTHER DISTRICT,
AND JABBAR'S GONNA

24:52.110 --> 24:53.759
HAVE TO MAKE ALL NEW FRIENDS,
AND THE WHOLE THING'S ON ME--

24:53.800 --> 24:55.006
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA WHOA--

24:55.040 --> 24:56.029
AND THEN, SOMEHOW,
IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.243
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET HIM TO HOGWARTS.

25:02.670 --> 25:04.638
BABY--

25:04.670 --> 25:07.662
I LOVE OUR HOUSE.
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HERE.

25:10.090 --> 25:13.082
I'M SO SORRY THAT I GOT US
IN THIS SITUATION.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.065
I LOVE OUR HOUSE TOO.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.989
YOU BUILT US
A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

25:24.030 --> 25:26.169
AND THE LUNCHEONETTE
IS AN AMAZING PLACE

25:26.210 --> 25:27.609
THAT YOU MADE HAPPEN.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.036
MM-HMM.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.072
BUT I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

25:31.110 --> 25:34.659
LOSING THOSE THINGS
DOESN'T SCARE ME AT ALL.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.588
YOU NOT TALKING TO ME,

25:36.630 --> 25:39.633
AND YOU RIDING OFF IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT--THAT SCARES ME.

27:56.430 --> 27:58.318
ALL RIGHT.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.248
DO YOU WANT TO--

28:00.290 --> 28:03.293
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

28:04.300 --> 28:06.154
THESE GUYS, THEY, LIKE--

28:06.200 --> 28:09.192
THEY BROUGHT A BEER BONG.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.436
AND I DON'T KNOW...

28:10.480 --> 28:15.133
I JUST--I FELT LIKE I
NEEDED TO PARTICIPATE,

28:15.170 --> 28:16.330
AND IT JUST--

28:16.380 --> 28:17.961
YEAH.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.137
PEER PRESSURE.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.863
YEAH, IT'S A CLASSIC.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.789
YEAH.
GOD.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.388
MAN.
LOOK,

28:26.420 --> 28:30.834
I AM BASICALLY THE LAST PERSON
THAT CAN TELL YOU NOT TO DRINK,

28:30.880 --> 28:33.394
-I KNOW.
-BUT, UM...I DON'T KNOW.

28:33.430 --> 28:36.843
JUST TRY TO REMEMBER
HOW BAD IT MADE YOU FEEL.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.986
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE,

28:40.020 --> 28:43.365
ALMOST NOTHING GOOD
EVER COMES OF A NIGHT LIKE THAT.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.065
RIGHT.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.922
AND YOU KNOW...

28:51.970 --> 28:53.790
ABOUT YOUR DAD,

28:53.830 --> 28:55.752
YOU KNOW...

28:55.800 --> 28:57.518
YOUR DAD IS TRYING,

28:57.560 --> 28:59.414
AND MY DAD...

29:00.980 --> 29:03.312
DIDN'T EVEN
GIVE IT A SHOT,

29:05.260 --> 29:07.114
AN D--
REALLY?

29:07.530 --> 29:09.805
MY DAD WASN'T EVEN THERE.

29:09.850 --> 29:11.533
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T EVEN--

29:11.570 --> 29:17.099
HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY,
AND I KNOW IT'S KIND
OF EMBARRASSING,

29:17.130 --> 29:22.193
BUT, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST YOUR DAD
IS DOING THE BEST HE CAN.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.232
I THINK YOU SHOULD CUT
HIM SOME SLACK, SERIOUSLY,

29:25.280 --> 29:27.794
BECAUSE YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

29:28.490 --> 29:31.004
I GET IT.
I DO.

29:32.630 --> 29:34.177
AND IT'S COOL
THAT YOU HAVE SUCH

29:34.220 --> 29:35.528
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR MOM,

29:35.560 --> 29:37.039
YOU KNOW?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.355
YEAH, IT IS.

29:39.390 --> 29:45.226
IT'S GREAT,
BUT IT TOOK
A LOT OF HARD WORK

29:45.260 --> 29:49.435
AND UNPLEASANT SITUATIONS
TO GET US THERE.

29:49.470 --> 29:53.406
BUT NOW,
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.953
SO...

29:57.170 --> 29:59.582
TRY, OKAY?ALL RIGHT.

29:59.620 --> 30:03.966
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU CAN TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT

30:04.000 --> 30:07.072
THAT I WAS MUCH WORSE
THAN YOU ARE AT YOUR AGE,

30:07.110 --> 30:09.487
SO THERE'S HOPE
FOR YOU YET.

30:09.530 --> 30:11.452
-REALLY?
-MUCH WORSE.

30:11.490 --> 30:14.357
-OKAY.
-SO THINK ABOUT IT.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.876
YEAH, SO, I'M JUST TRYING
TO THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE

30:19.920 --> 30:22.252
AND WHAT ACTUALLY
MAKES SENSE FOR ME,

30:22.300 --> 30:24.222
BUT YOU WERE
A BUSINESS MAJOR, RIGHT?

30:24.270 --> 30:25.646
YEAH, MANAGEMENT
AND STRATEGY.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.433
YEAH, SO I WAS THINKING
OF DOING ECONOMICS.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.857
IT SAYS THAT IT, LIKE,
HAS THE MOST OPTIONS,

30:30.890 --> 30:32.369
FROM WHAT I'VE READ.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.992
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO INTO, LIKE,
ACCOUNTING OR FINANCE WITH THAT.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.998
AT LEAST, YOU CAN GO
TO GRADUATE BUSINESS SCHOOL.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.179
YEAH, ECONOMICS IS GREAT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.861
YOU WOULD HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.457
BUT DREW, I REMEMBER BEING
WHERE YOU'RE AT,

30:44.490 --> 30:47.072
AND I THOUGHT
REAL PRACTICALLY.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.042
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
ABOUT MY DREAMS,

30:49.080 --> 30:50.069
OR WHAT I REALLY
WANTED TO DO.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.111
I JUST--I WANTED TO GET
A GOOD, SOLID MAJOR

30:52.160 --> 30:53.491
SO I COULD GET
A GOOD JOB, RIGHT?

30:53.540 --> 30:56.361
BUT YOU'RE AT THIS GREAT SCHOOL,
BERKELEY, RIGHT?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.197
YOU CAN EXPLORE ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

30:58.230 --> 31:01.051
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR
RESPONSIBILITIES RIGHT NOW.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.328
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
YOU SHOULD EXPLORE.

31:02.370 --> 31:04.679
FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY,
AND JUST FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.641
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT MAKING MONEY.

31:05.690 --> 31:06.850
NOT RIGHT NOW.

31:08.140 --> 31:09.448
HOLD ON A SECOND.
IS THAT THE ADVICE
YOU JUST GAVE HIM?

31:09.480 --> 31:10.924
"FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS, DON'T--YEAH.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.517
NO.
LISTEN TO MY ADVICE.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.653
LEARN HOW TO MAKE MONEY
WHILE YOU'RE THERE, ALL RIGHT?

31:14.700 --> 31:16.383
MAKE AS MUCH OF IT
AS YOU CAN,

31:16.420 --> 31:19.218
BECAUSE THAT OLD ADAGE, "MONEY
CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS", IT

31:19.250 --> 31:20.797
IT ABSOLUTELY BUYS YOU
HAPPINESS.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.001
[Adam] I DON'T THINK THAT'S
TRUE. I THINK THAT MONEY CAN BUY
YOU PEACE OF MIND,

31:23.050 --> 31:24.187
BUT NOT NECESSARILY
HAPPINESS.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.426
YEAH, AND THE LAST TIME
I CHECKED,

31:25.460 --> 31:30.056
PEACE OF MIND IS THE DEFINITION
OF HAPPINESS, SO MAKE MONEY.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.250
GREED IS GOOD.

31:34.230 --> 31:35.094
WELL--

31:37.440 --> 31:39.192
SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL,
MRS. B.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.026
OH, HEY, DYLAN.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.207
ACTUALLY, HONEY, CAN I--

31:42.240 --> 31:44.128
I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.967
OH, IS TODAY NOT GOOD
FOR YOU GUYS?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.308
NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
I JUST--

31:47.350 --> 31:49.204
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I--

31:49.250 --> 31:50.729
I REACHED OUT
TO YOUR PARENTS.

31:50.770 --> 31:54.103
I TRIED TO CALL THEM,
AND DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO THEM.

31:54.150 --> 31:55.219
I LEFT A MESSAGE--

31:55.250 --> 31:57.559
YEAH,
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.
THEY WERE OUT OF TOWN.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.419
IT'S OKAY.

31:58.460 --> 31:59.700
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE NOT HORRIBLE PEOPLE.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.048
THEY'RE JUST
NOT AROUND A LOT,

32:01.090 --> 32:02.944
WITH THEIR COMPANY
AND EVERYTHING.

32:02.990 --> 32:04.116
GOT IT.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.366
OKAY,
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

32:05.400 --> 32:10.099
I JUST--I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AWARE
MAX HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU.

32:10.130 --> 32:11.540
YOU KNOW THAT HE THINKS
THAT THERE'S THIS--

32:11.580 --> 32:13.502
THIS STRONG FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

32:13.550 --> 32:16.098
AND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
THERE, AND--I JUST WANT TO BE

32:16.140 --> 32:19.029
SURE THAT YOU'RE COMING
OVER TO HANG OUT WITH HIM,

32:19.070 --> 32:21.550
NOT JUST US,

32:21.590 --> 32:24.627
BECAUSE YOU MISS YOUR--
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

32:24.660 --> 32:25.968
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.978
MAX REALLY,
REALLY LIKES YOU.

32:28.010 --> 32:31.002
YEAH,
I THINK MAX IS AWESOME.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.039
YEAH, HE IS AWESOME.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.183
HE'S AN AWESOME KID.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.562
I LIKE BOTH OF YOU.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.046
I LIKE ALL OF YOU,
BUT SOMETIMES MAX IS FUNNY,

32:37.090 --> 32:38.364
AND SOMETIMES MAX IS BORING,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.322
AND I LIKE TALKING TO YOU
WHEN HE'S BORING.

32:40.370 --> 32:41.598
MY--MY HOME
IS PRETTY BORING TOO,

32:41.640 --> 32:43.221
BUT I'M OKAY
STAYING BY MYSELF.

32:43.270 --> 32:44.601
IT'S FINE, SO...

32:44.650 --> 32:46.265
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.165
YOU'RE COMING OVER TODAY,
AFTER SCHOOL.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.304
I JUST--I WANTED TO LET
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALL.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.716
OKAY?
I INSIST.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.307
IT'S ALL GOOD.
OKAY.

32:53.350 --> 32:54.419
OKAY?

32:54.450 --> 32:55.724
-GREAT.
-GREAT.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.068
-BYE MRS. B. YEP.
-I'LL SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

32:57.110 --> 32:59.453
-WE'LL BAKE SOMETHING.
-OKAY.

33:07.390 --> 33:09.631
HEY, AMBER.

33:09.670 --> 33:12.673
BROUGHT YOU SOME HERBAL TEA--
LITTLE PEACE OFFERING.

33:12.710 --> 33:14.189
IT'S DECAF.

33:14.230 --> 33:15.322
THAN KS.

33:15.370 --> 33:17.156
H EY,

33:17.200 --> 33:20.169
WE'RE REALLY SORRY
THAT YOU OVERHEARD US
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.168
WE JUST DON'T WANT
YOU TO WORRY ABOUT THE
BUSINESS STUFF.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.065
THAT'S OUR JOB.

33:24.790 --> 33:26.303
BUT THAT'S, LIKE,
EXACTLY MY POINT--

33:26.340 --> 33:28.205
IS THAT IT'S MY JOB TOO.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.413
I'M A BIG PART
OF THIS COMPANY.

33:30.450 --> 33:32.031
YOU KNOW,
I ASKED YOU
FOR A RAISE

33:32.070 --> 33:33.310
BECAUSE I THINK I DESERVE IT,

33:33.350 --> 33:35.341
NOT BECAUSE I'M, LIKE,
PREGNANT OR YOUR NIECE.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.529
IT'S BECAUSE I WORK REALLY,
REALLY HARD.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.664
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU WORK AS HARD AS WE DO.

33:39.700 --> 33:40.735
YOU KNOW,

33:40.770 --> 33:41.759
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING,

33:41.810 --> 33:43.596
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T, LIKE,

33:43.640 --> 33:45.596
HONEST OR STRAIGHTFORWARD
WITH ME ABOUT IT,

33:45.640 --> 33:48.222
AND SO I DIDN'T EVEN GET
THE CHANCE TO, LIKE,

33:48.260 --> 33:51.127
LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
IF THIS FALLS THROUGH, YOU KNOW?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.570
AND NOW,
I'M LIKE A TOTAL PIGGY,

33:52.610 --> 33:54.817
AND NOBODY'S GONNA WANT TO HIRE
ME, AND I HAVE NO OPTIONS.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.260
WELL, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT A PIGGY.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.402
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

33:58.450 --> 33:59.849
SECONDLY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

33:59.890 --> 34:03.474
WE'RE--WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.374
I MEAN, WE HAVE
A SECRET WEAPON.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.445
THIS IS MR. BACKUP PLAN.

34:07.490 --> 34:10.141
HE'S GOT BACKUP PLANS
FOR HIS BACKUP PLAN, RIGHT?

34:10.180 --> 34:11.454
I DO.

34:11.490 --> 34:13.549
I GOT A BACKUP PLAN
FOR THAT BACKUP PLAN.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.147
[Crosby]
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

34:15.190 --> 34:17.636
WE'RE FINE.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.558
-RIGHT.
-YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.464
YEP.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.536
-HEY.
-HEY, HONEY.

34:28.580 --> 34:32.368
HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT
WE ARE OVERDRAWN AND
LATE ON TWO BILLS?

34:32.410 --> 34:33.570
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

34:33.620 --> 34:37.135
I ALSO KEEP FORGETTING TO TELL
YOU, IT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT,

34:37.170 --> 34:38.797
BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT
IN MY CAR IS ON.

34:38.830 --> 34:39.899
GREAT,
THAT'S ALL I NEED.

34:39.930 --> 34:41.795
I JUST CHANGED THE OIL
IN THAT THING.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.829
OKAY, I CAN TAKE IT IN.
IT'S OKAY.

34:45.870 --> 34:47.349
-NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
-I'LL TAKE IT IN. I'M--

34:47.390 --> 34:48.800
NO, I'LL TAKE IT IN.
I'LL TAKE THE CAR IN.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.762
IT'S NOT THE CAR, IT'S JUST
EVERYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW.

34:50.810 --> 34:52.289
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

34:52.330 --> 34:55.299
-I--BELIEVE ME--
-EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMETHING
FROM ME--IT'S MOM AND IT'S DAD.

34:55.330 --> 34:56.706
IT'S CROSBY
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE.

34:56.740 --> 34:58.844
IT'S LIKE A WEIGHT AROUND
MY NECK, AND I WANT IT GONE.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.268
AND I COULD CALL
A HEADHUNTER TOMORROW.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.335
I COULD GET A JOB JOB,

35:01.370 --> 35:03.224
AND I COULD GET THE
LUNCHEONETTE OFF MY PLATE.

35:03.270 --> 35:06.194
I COULD DO THAT, AND IT WOULD
MAKE MY LIFE A LOT EASIER.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.400
YEP.

35:07.450 --> 35:09.168
YOU COULD.

35:09.210 --> 35:13.237
YOU COULD ABSOLUTELY DO
ALL OF THAT, BUT YOU WON'T.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.896
HONEY,
THAT'S NOT
WHO YOU ARE.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.339
YOU DON'T JUST
GET INTO SOMETHING

35:17.390 --> 35:19.346
AND JUST WALK
AWAY FROM IT.

35:19.390 --> 35:20.664
KRISTINA--I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR SO LONG...

35:20.700 --> 35:21.928
AND I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN,

35:21.980 --> 35:24.312
YOU ACT UALLY--I DON'T KNOW.
YOU LIKE IT.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.214
NO, I DON'T.YOU LIKE HELPING PEOPLE.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.568
YOU DON'T LIKE
TORTURING YOURSELF,

35:27.600 --> 35:29.465
BUT YOU LIKE
HELPING PEOPLE.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.810
IT'S PART OF THE REASON
WHY I LOVE YOU.

35:32.850 --> 35:33.885
IT'S WHAT MAKES YOU YOU.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.228
-YEAH .
-YOU KNOW?

35:35.270 --> 35:37.647
-I'M MY OWN, WORST ENEMY.
-YOU ARE.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.238
IT'S WHAT MAKES YOU ADAM.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.578
AND SEE, THE BEST PART...

35:40.620 --> 35:43.578
-YEAH?
-IS THAT YOU TAKE CARE
OF EVERYBODY ELSE...

35:43.620 --> 35:46.271
-MM-HMM.
-AND I GET TO
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.345
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?

35:47.380 --> 35:48.608
WELL, I HAVE MY WAYS.

35:48.660 --> 35:49.684
-OH, YEAH?
-I HAVE A PLAN, ACTUALLY.

35:49.730 --> 35:50.822
-YOU DO?
-YEP.

35:50.870 --> 35:53.486
-YOU HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK?
-MM-HMM. MOVE YOUR HANDS.

35:53.530 --> 35:56.385
-HONEY, HONEY--
-WOW.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.875
-WATCH THE MOVIE.
-THIS IS--WHAT IS THIS?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.798
SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT-- BREAKFAST CLUB.

36:03.850 --> 36:05.397
IT'S A CLASSIC.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.671
YOU EVEN KNOW--IT DOESN'T
RING ANY BELL FOR YOU?

36:07.710 --> 36:10.270
IT'S ELMO'S THING--

36:10.300 --> 36:11.403
OR WHATEVER--FIRE?

36:11.440 --> 36:12.850
-WHAT? NO.
-YOU KNOW, THE KIDS--

36:12.890 --> 36:15.233
SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE,
BUT THIS IS BETTER, I THINK.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.306
-IT'S NOT MY THING.
-YOU DON'T LIKE GOOD MOVIES?

36:17.340 --> 36:18.443
YEAH,
PATTONAND ROCKY.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.448
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.447
-OH.
-HEY.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.347
