01:21.223 --> 01:24.893
A great poet once said
that all the secrets of the oceans

01:25.019 --> 01:27.396
can be found in just one drop of water.

01:28.605 --> 01:30.399
Now, I don't know if that's true or not,

01:30.524 --> 01:34.361
but I do know that the ocean
holds more than just a few secrets.

01:34.445 --> 01:39.992
And, one summer, I discovered one
that would change my life... forever.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.172
Your mom and I used to come here all the time.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.676
- Really?
- I...

01:57.801 --> 02:00.220
Your mom loved the central coast.

02:01.805 --> 02:04.308
She would come stare at the water for hours and hours.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.856
Your mom only met your grandpa once.

02:10.939 --> 02:14.651
And I can tell you he liked her
a lot more than he liked me, that's for sure.

02:15.819 --> 02:18.572
What about Grandma? Did they get along?

02:18.697 --> 02:20.824
Your mom never met your grandmother.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.577
Heck, I never met your grandmother.

02:23.702 --> 02:27.873
Like never, ever?
Or you just don't remember?

02:27.956 --> 02:30.042
You know? I asked your grandfather about her, but...

02:33.087 --> 02:34.546
He didn't like to talk about her much.

02:36.965 --> 02:38.008
Listen, Ry...

02:39.843 --> 02:41.887
I know this move is gonna be tough for you.

02:42.012 --> 02:44.056
You know? Leaving your friends,

02:44.139 --> 02:45.557
leaving your school...

02:46.934 --> 02:47.934
I get that.

02:50.062 --> 02:53.941
You know?
As grumpy as your grandfather is,...

02:55.776 --> 02:57.820
we're the only family he's got.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.242
He needs us right now,
as much as he would hate to admit that.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.872
I'm gonna miss San Diego too.

03:08.956 --> 03:13.544
But... you're gonna love Santa Carla.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.046
I promise.

03:27.558 --> 03:29.518
No, you are not singing opera right now.

03:30.728 --> 03:33.439
Santa Carla, Santa Carla.

03:33.564 --> 03:34.898
Please, stop.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.819
Hey!

03:38.944 --> 03:40.487
Okay, don't text and drive. Ever.

03:40.612 --> 03:43.073
When you're older,
do not text and drive, you understand?

03:52.875 --> 03:57.046
Ninety-nine cartons of milk on the wall
Ninety-nine cartons of milk

03:57.171 --> 03:59.298
- If one of those ... cartons ...
- If you take down ...

03:59.423 --> 04:00.924
- I don't know that part.
- Pass it around ...

04:01.008 --> 04:04.970
How do you not know this song? Yet, you know opera.

04:05.054 --> 04:06.334
We used to sing it with beer,

04:06.430 --> 04:09.475
but you're not quite legal yet,
Ry, so we wouldn't be doing that.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.684
Okay.

04:13.896 --> 04:15.397
Check it out. Santa Carla.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.858
Gorgeous, huh?

04:21.195 --> 04:24.573
- How far to his house?
- Almost there.

04:36.919 --> 04:38.462
Yo! Jay!

04:39.505 --> 04:40.506
Mattie?

04:41.799 --> 04:43.342
Hey, man!

04:43.425 --> 04:45.427
What happened to you?

04:45.552 --> 04:48.430
You know, I've been meaning
to come back sooner.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.682
I just got super busy...

04:49.765 --> 04:52.434
- No, I mean, you got old.
- Very funny.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.727
- Very funny.
- I like, I like this guy.

04:53.852 --> 04:55.896
You know, you're not a spring chicken yourself.

04:56.021 --> 04:59.400
Oh, come on. I think I make
middle-age look pretty good.

04:59.525 --> 05:02.403
You must be Ryan.
I've heard good things.

05:02.486 --> 05:04.405
Really? Where?

05:04.488 --> 05:06.907
but, you know...
your, your old man and me

05:06.990 --> 05:09.118
we get to talk when 
we're out in the ocean.

05:09.243 --> 05:10.786
That is when he feels like talking.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.746
Well, where is he? Is he up in the house?

05:12.871 --> 05:15.708
No, he's... right where he always is.

05:15.791 --> 05:17.251
- Working on the engine.
- Oh, man.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.753
He just got out of the hospital.
He's supposed to be resting.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.214
Yeah, well, maybe he'll listen to you.

05:22.297 --> 05:25.384
- Hey, I'll let you go.
- Alright, buddy. Be good.

05:25.467 --> 05:26.507
- Pretty sweet.
- Bye, sweetheart.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.220
- Bye.
- Good meeting you.

05:38.647 --> 05:41.400
Jay! Did you get all those traps off loaded yet?

05:42.609 --> 05:43.986
Hey, Pop!

05:46.822 --> 05:48.782
Still taking it easy, I see.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.911
What day is it?

05:53.037 --> 05:55.456
What... What day is it?
What day is it?

05:55.539 --> 05:57.249
- Tuesday?
- It's Tuesday.

06:00.002 --> 06:01.620
You're early.

06:03.047 --> 06:04.757
Yeah, sorry about that.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.760
Traffic... was light.

06:07.843 --> 06:10.262
I see the old girl 
is still sea worthy.

06:11.764 --> 06:13.932
Speaking of old girls,
you remember Ryan.

06:14.058 --> 06:17.436
Last time you saw her,
she was barely walking or talking.

06:18.896 --> 06:21.690
She does much the latter anymore.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.108
Hi.

06:25.402 --> 06:27.780
Well, I'll expect you'll want to know
where to put your stuff.

06:33.369 --> 06:34.536
It's good to see you.

06:37.706 --> 06:40.292
Yeah, that's... that's your room right there.

06:40.417 --> 06:41.877
Yeah.

06:43.045 --> 06:45.798
Well, it's beautiful.

06:45.923 --> 06:47.966
I really like the color.

06:51.303 --> 06:54.223
Needed a fresh coat of paint anyway.

06:54.348 --> 06:56.850
This mural is so pretty.

07:01.647 --> 07:02.815
A friend of mine did that.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.235
Well, I really like it.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.071
Right.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.406
Settle in.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.007
What's the matter? You don't like your fish?

07:33.387 --> 07:35.222
My guess I'm just not that hungry.

07:35.347 --> 07:39.059
It's just I don't blame you.
It's not local.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.811
That didn't come from the ocean.

07:41.854 --> 07:45.232
Bring them in frozen from some farm somewhere.

07:46.483 --> 07:48.944
You know? I just got under the point

07:49.069 --> 07:51.697
where you can't put any fresh 
food on your table anymore.

07:51.822 --> 07:52.990
It's like... No.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.910
I can't even remember the last time 
that I caught anything edible around here.

07:57.036 --> 08:00.289
Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad, listen.
About that...

08:01.707 --> 08:03.667
I think you should listen to your doctors

08:03.751 --> 08:06.253
and take a little break from fishing.

08:06.378 --> 08:08.714
Just... Just for a little while.

08:08.797 --> 08:10.466
I think you should take it easy.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.217
- Take it easy?
- Take it easy.

08:12.301 --> 08:13.469
- For a little while.
- Mhm.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.054
Okay, you know?

08:15.137 --> 08:18.474
And hey, why don't you let me... 
try my luck at it?

08:18.599 --> 08:19.892
- Alright? While you...
- You?

08:19.975 --> 08:23.645
Yeah, alright?
While you rest up and get well.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.398
I thought you were here to help me.

08:26.482 --> 08:31.111
Well, I, I, I am.
We, we are... here to help you. Yeah.

08:31.236 --> 08:34.114
Yeah.
Well then, help me already.

08:34.239 --> 08:37.451
I mean, you've been here 5 minutes
and already you're telling me what to do.

08:37.576 --> 08:39.828
- That kind of help I don't need!
- Alright.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.914
Dad, listen.
You gotta rest up a little bit.

08:43.039 --> 08:47.169
Yeah, I can take it easy...
when I'm dead.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.838
Well, if you keep at this pace, you will be.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.092
You know what my doctor said?
He said take aspirin.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.344
I got aspirin.

08:57.054 --> 08:58.514
We put out first thing in the morning.

08:58.639 --> 09:03.060
I suggest that you get some rest,... my son.

09:06.188 --> 09:07.481
You do not have to finish that.

09:08.857 --> 09:10.937
Well, I have a feeling I'd 
better get used to it.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.524
Ryan.

09:50.649 --> 09:52.067
Hey, Dad.

09:53.527 --> 09:56.405
Oh, the old man doesn't whip out the
paint brush for just anyone.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.033
Oh, so you're saying he's 
not always this cheery?

09:59.158 --> 10:00.868
No, you caught him on a good day.

10:00.993 --> 10:04.288
- What are all these?
- Mom's.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.665
- Yeah.
- Ah, The Fisher King.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.043
You know what it's about?

10:10.836 --> 10:13.005
Oh, you have to read it.

10:13.088 --> 10:14.590
You know what? Reading's 
not really my thing.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.842
Why don't you give me 
the clip notes version?

10:16.925 --> 10:19.219
I can't do that, but
how about I give you the plot?

10:20.554 --> 10:23.349
It's about a wounded ruler

10:23.432 --> 10:27.728
whose kingdom slowly but surely
is becoming a baring wasteland.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.314
And since he can no longer
leave the castle to fish,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.066
his son has to fill the shoes.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.069
Are you messing with me?

10:35.194 --> 10:36.904
No, oddly enough.

10:37.946 --> 10:39.782
What happens at the end?

10:39.907 --> 10:42.368
Well, I can't tell you that.
No spoilers.

10:42.451 --> 10:43.786
You just have to read it to find out.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.540
Oh, man. When did your mom 
inscribe this to you?

10:51.919 --> 10:56.673
Oh, uh,... the hospital.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.802
About a week before...

11:45.222 --> 11:46.390
And no one's here.

11:49.101 --> 11:54.231
"There's a cafÃ© around the corner.
Food, have fun, be home by 6:00."

13:16.063 --> 13:17.648
I miss you, mom.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.140
It's okay, it's okay!

13:51.265 --> 13:52.349
I got you, I got you!

13:55.686 --> 13:57.187
I... I got you!

13:59.231 --> 14:00.458
- My gosh! Come here, it's okay!
- Thank you.

14:00.482 --> 14:03.527
It's okay, it's okay. Wait!
Stop! Wait! No, stop!

14:03.610 --> 14:05.487
Come back, stop, I can help you!

14:08.532 --> 14:11.452
My necklace!
No, no, no, no! Wait!

14:13.037 --> 14:14.288
No! Where did it go?

14:36.352 --> 14:38.687
Hey. So, how do you 
like our little town?

14:41.190 --> 14:42.691
It's alright, I guess.

14:43.817 --> 14:44.818
You alright?

14:48.614 --> 14:50.783
Dad, I lost my locket today.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.994
What? Where?

14:55.704 --> 14:59.208
Down at the docks. I don't...
I don't even know what happened.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.127
The docks? That's no place 
for a girl your age.

15:02.252 --> 15:05.005
- It's too dangerous out there.
- Your grandfather's right, kiddo.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.216
What's the big deal anyways?

15:07.341 --> 15:10.135
It's just water, and it's not like 
I don't know how to swim, Dad.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.638
No. Still the same, you should only 
go down there

15:12.721 --> 15:15.349
- if you're with your grandfather or I, okay?
- Yeah.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.977
Fine.

15:19.103 --> 15:21.271
Alright, why don't you go wash up.
Dinner's almost ready.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.567
Take this.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.152
Put that on the plate, but don't...

15:27.236 --> 15:28.320
- It's hot!
- Ah.

16:08.986 --> 16:10.821
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.491
Why would someone set a net at the docks?

16:17.911 --> 16:20.539
- They wouldn't.
- They would.

16:20.622 --> 16:22.624
If you wanna catch something big.

16:22.750 --> 16:25.544
Oh, Dad, please, don't go on about this.

16:25.627 --> 16:29.089
- Go on about what?
- Trust me, you don't wanna know.

16:29.173 --> 16:31.759
There's a reason why there 
ain't anymore fish around here.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.053
Oh, Dad, come on.

16:34.178 --> 16:36.889
Let's not fill her head with 
crazy fishermen tales, okay?

16:36.972 --> 16:38.307
Fine, let me ask you then:

16:38.432 --> 16:40.392
How many fish did we catch today?

16:40.517 --> 16:43.562
None is how many, and you know why.

16:43.645 --> 16:45.397
- Don't say it.
- Mermaids.

16:45.522 --> 16:49.902
- He said it. Ok, look...
- Mermaids.

16:49.985 --> 16:53.614
Dad, listen... it's the dolphins.

16:53.739 --> 16:56.408
It's the seals, okay?
It's... it's not the mermaids.

16:56.533 --> 16:59.745
No, I know, I know.
But it's both, okay?

17:00.871 --> 17:03.957
I know you think
I'm just a crazy old man,

17:04.083 --> 17:07.086
but I know. But I know.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.214
Mermaids.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.925
- Mhm.
- Yeah.

17:20.641 --> 17:22.184
Dad, she's 12.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.663
I don't need you filling
her head with your tall tales

17:24.686 --> 17:28.357
of mermaids or sirens or vampires
or God knows what.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.775
What would you know about them?

17:29.900 --> 17:32.528
I mean, you left here years ago
when the going got tough.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.780
- You ain't been here.
- Yeah, well, we're here now.

17:34.905 --> 17:36.240
Okay? And don't ask me...

17:36.323 --> 17:38.784
No, you can't hide her 
from the truth forever.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.452
I can't, I won't.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.140
Ryan? You alright in there?

18:46.143 --> 18:47.853
Ryan? Are you okay?

18:47.936 --> 18:49.688
I'm just taking a bath.

18:49.813 --> 18:52.483
Yeah, well, you've been there for a while.

18:52.566 --> 18:53.567
I just wanted to make sure.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.862
I'm fine, Dad.
Really, I'm okay.

18:56.945 --> 18:59.573
- Thanks.
- Ok.

19:02.910 --> 19:04.036
10 minutes?

19:05.079 --> 19:06.413
What?

19:54.586 --> 19:56.255
Okay, it has to be here somewhere.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.773
Hello?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.362
Is someone there?

20:22.990 --> 20:25.325
If you're the girl I saw yesterday,

20:25.451 --> 20:29.204
I... I won't hurt you.
I promise!

20:30.497 --> 20:32.624
I just wanna be your friend.

20:34.543 --> 20:35.543
I am crazy.

20:36.545 --> 20:38.213
I must be.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.466
Absolutely crazy.

20:40.591 --> 20:44.011
I think this is yours.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.807
Oh my gosh!

20:50.851 --> 20:52.811
I thought I lost it.

20:53.937 --> 20:58.317
Wait. Didn't, didn't you have a... a tail?

21:00.903 --> 21:03.364
You can't walk with a tail.

21:04.740 --> 21:08.202
Well, thank you.
So, so much.

21:10.329 --> 21:11.997
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

21:12.122 --> 21:17.127
- Of course. So, you're a mer...
- Coral.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.630
My name is Coral.

21:19.755 --> 21:21.882
Oh, I'm Ryan.

21:27.388 --> 21:29.682
- It's called a handshake.
- Oh.

21:32.267 --> 21:33.267
Oh.

21:35.354 --> 21:38.524
I have to go.
My mom's calling me.

21:39.858 --> 21:41.443
I don't hear anything.

21:45.614 --> 21:48.075
Close your eyes and listen.

22:01.380 --> 22:05.676
Coral. Coral. Coral.
Coral. Coral!

22:11.056 --> 22:12.766
It's beautiful.

22:17.229 --> 22:18.689
Um...

22:18.772 --> 22:21.316
- One more thing...
- Yeah?

22:23.027 --> 22:25.612
Don't tell anyone about what you saw.

22:25.738 --> 22:26.989
You promise?

22:28.032 --> 22:31.452
I promise, but what did I see?

22:35.039 --> 22:36.749
You do have a tail!

22:38.876 --> 22:40.961
Coral, wait! Come back!

22:41.086 --> 22:43.797
There's so many things I wanna ask you!

23:01.607 --> 23:02.858
Hi.

23:03.901 --> 23:06.320
Hey.
How was your day?

23:06.403 --> 23:11.533
It was great.
Just... rode my bike around town.

23:13.494 --> 23:16.955
Oh, well, you... found your locket,
so that is something.

23:21.835 --> 23:26.632
Yes. That is something.
That is definitely something.

23:26.757 --> 23:28.801
And it is the funniest something.

23:28.884 --> 23:32.429
It turns out it was right here the whole time, 
and I didn't do anything.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.188
Fine, fine, fine.
You got me.

23:41.313 --> 23:43.691
It was down at the lower docks
where I knew it was.

23:43.816 --> 23:47.903
So, so should I punish you for lying to me
or for disobeying my orders?

23:48.028 --> 23:49.488
Dad, you can not punish me more.

23:49.571 --> 23:51.448
This whole situation is punishment enough.

23:53.951 --> 23:55.661
Alright. Fine.

23:55.744 --> 23:59.331
But no more lying and no more going down 
to those docks unsupervised, okay?

23:59.456 --> 24:01.041
- Deal.
- Deal?

24:01.166 --> 24:02.326
- Deal.
- Deal?

24:02.376 --> 24:04.753
I said deal.
Hey, Dad.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.588
Yeah?

24:08.382 --> 24:10.509
Quick question, uh...

24:12.177 --> 24:17.182
Did you ever stop to think that
maybe, just maybe,

24:17.307 --> 24:18.642
Grandpa isn't so crazy?

24:20.060 --> 24:22.563
Come on, Ry, you are too old to believe
that sort of stuff.

24:22.688 --> 24:23.688
Grandpa believes.

24:23.731 --> 24:27.026
Yeah, well, Grandpa
is a crazy old man, okay?

24:27.151 --> 24:28.736
Mermaids are his obsession.

24:28.861 --> 24:31.697
There has to be some element 
of truth to our myths.

24:31.822 --> 24:34.074
Don't you think?
I mean, there has to be.

24:34.199 --> 24:36.452
You're more like your mother than you know.

24:36.577 --> 24:38.704
And you're too clever for your own good.

24:40.456 --> 24:42.416
Hey, what do you say we go out 
to dinner, just you and I?

24:42.499 --> 24:45.711
I don't know about you, but I am sick 
and tired of fish and vegetables.

24:45.836 --> 24:47.629
I can't do it anymore. I can't.

24:47.755 --> 24:49.715
- Trust me, me too.
- Alright, come on.

24:49.798 --> 24:52.760
That sounds amazing.
I'll be down in 5.

24:55.763 --> 24:57.139
Thanks, guys, for coming in.

24:57.264 --> 24:58.474
- Thanks.
- Have a great night.

25:01.602 --> 25:03.729
We're, we're not too late, are we?

25:06.982 --> 25:08.650
Only about 20 years.

25:08.776 --> 25:10.986
Jenna, wow.
Has it been that long?

25:11.111 --> 25:12.237
- Hi.
- You look great.

25:13.697 --> 25:18.077
Please, come in.
Sit down.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.536
- Hi!
- Hi!

25:19.620 --> 25:21.163
Aren't you just the prettiest thing.

25:21.288 --> 25:22.581
- Thanks.
- What's your name?

25:22.664 --> 25:24.083
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.918
She gets her looks from her mom.

25:26.043 --> 25:29.421
- Yes, clearly.
- And, uh... and her brains too.

25:29.505 --> 25:31.382
Wow, she sounds like quite a woman.

25:33.050 --> 25:36.512
She was. She... she passed away.

25:38.138 --> 25:40.099
I am so sorry, Matt.

25:40.182 --> 25:42.518
Yeah, it's alright.
It's been a little while now.

25:45.771 --> 25:47.856
Well, it's really nice to meet you, Ryan.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.858
- Yeah, you too.
- I'm Jenna.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.486
I'm an old friend of your father's.

25:53.654 --> 25:54.655
Anyway, I'm gonna leave you guys alone

25:54.738 --> 25:56.448
- with the menus for a couple of minutes.
- Okay.

25:58.033 --> 26:00.828
So,... you know what you want?

26:00.953 --> 26:03.038
What am I thinking?
What am I thinking right now?

26:03.163 --> 26:07.042
I am thinking. I am thinking that you and her 
used to be a lot more than just old friends.

26:07.167 --> 26:08.460
That's what I'm thinking right now.

26:08.585 --> 26:09.795
Alright, have I told you lately

26:09.920 --> 26:12.297
that you're too clever for your own good?

26:12.381 --> 26:14.717
Oh, there is no way you are getting 
off the hook that easy.

26:14.842 --> 26:16.802
- I need details.
- Just pick something to eat.

26:16.927 --> 26:18.554
Okay? Just pick something 
because she's coming back.

26:18.679 --> 26:20.156
- Pick something.
- She's too fast, I'm not ready.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.808
- Please, pick something. Shut up.
- Anything? Okay, okay.

26:22.891 --> 26:24.768
- Hi!
- Hi.

26:24.852 --> 26:26.145
So, what can I get you?

26:28.856 --> 26:32.818
I would like a strawberry cupcake 
and a vanilla milkshake, please.

26:32.943 --> 26:35.029
- Is it okay?
- For dinner? No. No.

26:35.154 --> 26:36.447
Daddy, you said anything.

26:37.614 --> 26:40.034
You know what? We will have two of those.

26:41.744 --> 26:45.497
Two cupcakes and milkshakes coming right up.

26:45.581 --> 26:48.042
Okay, she's gone again.
So, details now, details later?

26:48.167 --> 26:50.127
Shut up. Shut up.

26:58.052 --> 27:01.180
- So, how was it?
- So good.

27:01.263 --> 27:03.849
Without a doubt, the best meal
I've had since we've gotten here.

27:03.974 --> 27:05.267
Wow.

27:05.392 --> 27:06.643
When did you guys get in town?

27:07.895 --> 27:09.188
We got back a few days ago.

27:12.649 --> 27:13.859
How long are you staying?

27:15.402 --> 27:19.782
My dad is sort of having some health problems,
so we're here indefinitely.

27:19.907 --> 27:21.992
Oh, I'm sorry about your dad.

27:22.076 --> 27:25.204
But I hope I get to see more of you guys around.

27:25.287 --> 27:26.663
You can count on it.

27:29.291 --> 27:32.252
That wasn't awkward at all, right?

27:34.797 --> 27:39.259
- So, before Mom, you and Jenna were...
- Close. Yeah.

27:39.343 --> 27:42.096
And what exactly happened there?

27:42.221 --> 27:43.806
I mean, Dad, why did you leave?

27:43.931 --> 27:47.351
- Well, you are really curious.
- Yeah, I am.

27:47.476 --> 27:49.978
Look, I just had to get out of this place, okay?

27:50.104 --> 27:51.897
I had to try something new.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.566
And you're sure this doesn't have anything to do

27:54.650 --> 27:56.235
with the fact that Grandpa believes

27:56.318 --> 27:58.278
mermaids are driving the fish out of the water?

27:58.404 --> 27:59.905
Grandpa believes a lot of things.

28:00.030 --> 28:03.534
And think about it,
nobody's ever agreed with him.

28:03.617 --> 28:06.203
No wonder he's so cold and grumpy.

28:06.286 --> 28:07.913
Well, he used to be not so grumpy.

28:08.038 --> 28:09.790
What happened?

28:11.542 --> 28:13.961
Look, all this mermaid business didn't help,

28:14.044 --> 28:15.963
but this town was thriving once.

28:16.046 --> 28:17.631
Things dried up. Everything went South.

28:17.756 --> 28:20.134
The fish left, people left but,
not your grandfather.

28:20.259 --> 28:22.720
He stuck it out through thick and thin.

28:23.846 --> 28:27.099
Look... I know he seems like 
the grumpiest guy in the world...

28:27.224 --> 28:30.352
- Yeah, yeah, he does.
- But he does love you,

28:30.477 --> 28:35.232
and I can tell that he 
sees your grandma in you.

28:36.734 --> 28:37.818
Really?

28:51.665 --> 28:52.665
Ryan?

28:56.503 --> 28:57.671
Ryan!

28:59.757 --> 29:02.301
- Come on, kiddo. Up!
- Really?

29:06.388 --> 29:09.725
Grandpa, it is 5 in the morning.
Why?

29:09.850 --> 29:13.270
Because in this family, 
we earn our keep. Come on.

29:17.566 --> 29:18.942
- Alright, buddy.
- Thanks.

29:19.985 --> 29:21.445
Alright, we'll be back by dinner.

29:21.528 --> 29:23.655
- Have fun.
- Yeah, loads of fun.

29:23.781 --> 29:25.407
Don't worry about it, we'll be good.

29:26.950 --> 29:28.327
Alright.

29:28.410 --> 29:31.372
Look, see these holes right here? Alright?

29:31.497 --> 29:35.167
Even if there was fish to catch,
we're not catching them with these.

29:35.292 --> 29:38.337
So, I need you to go to 
that storage bin right there,

29:38.462 --> 29:40.547
find some lines
so we can patch these up, okay?

29:40.673 --> 29:42.841
- Got it.
- Okay. Alright.

29:54.269 --> 29:56.230
- Ryan!
- Coral?

29:57.356 --> 29:58.524
What are you doing here?

29:58.649 --> 29:59.942
I wanted to see you again.

30:00.067 --> 30:02.277
I felt bad about leaving 
so fast the other day.

30:02.403 --> 30:04.571
But if somebody sees you?

30:05.781 --> 30:06.781
Don't worry.

30:06.865 --> 30:09.576
I've cut holes in all the nets around here.

30:09.702 --> 30:11.203
That oughta keep them busy for a while.

30:11.328 --> 30:14.915
"That'll keep them busy for a while." Sure.

30:17.251 --> 30:20.170
So that's what you were doing the other day.

30:20.254 --> 30:21.630
Maybe.

30:23.382 --> 30:25.968
Hey, Ryan!
You find that line yet?

30:26.093 --> 30:28.554
Just a second, Jay!
I'll be back in a minute!

30:28.637 --> 30:32.683
Wait, you're...
you're one of them?

30:33.767 --> 30:34.768
No.

30:34.852 --> 30:37.396
Jay is just my dad's friend
who needed help and I'm...

30:37.521 --> 30:39.398
Your father is a fisherman?

30:39.481 --> 30:43.569
Well, my grandpa too actually.
Well, they all are.

30:43.652 --> 30:45.904
- But...
- But the fishermen hunt my kind!

30:46.030 --> 30:48.240
Well, not my family.

30:48.365 --> 30:50.826
Or Jay either.
He's sweet, I swear.

30:50.951 --> 30:52.703
And he's not gonna hurt you.

30:53.871 --> 30:56.248
Are they sweet like you?

30:56.331 --> 30:58.542
Ryan! The line!

30:59.626 --> 31:01.211
Coming!

31:02.629 --> 31:05.758
Okay, look. I have to go 
"fix" these nets,

31:05.883 --> 31:07.509
but I promise I won't do a very good job.

31:08.552 --> 31:09.553
And I should be done soon,

31:09.636 --> 31:12.014
so, can you meet me at the lower dock?

31:12.139 --> 31:14.266
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.809
- Okay.
- I'll see you in a while.

31:15.934 --> 31:16.977
Ryan!

31:17.102 --> 31:18.604
Hey!

31:18.729 --> 31:20.105
What in the world is taking you so long?

31:20.230 --> 31:23.108
I have been looking everywhere

31:23.233 --> 31:26.612
and I just can not seem to find it.

31:26.695 --> 31:28.655
- Really?
- Mhm.

31:28.739 --> 31:31.158
Wow, you must have been looking real hard.

31:32.326 --> 31:36.830
Ah... You meant inside the green thingy.

31:36.955 --> 31:39.041
You knucklehead.
Think fast.

31:40.209 --> 31:41.877
- All good.
- Come on.

31:46.715 --> 31:47.966
Coral?

31:49.468 --> 31:50.928
Coral?

31:52.596 --> 31:53.931
Coral?

31:59.186 --> 32:03.482
- That is absolutely amazing.
- It is?

32:03.565 --> 32:05.609
Are you kidding?

32:05.693 --> 32:08.529
People would freak if they knew you could do that.

32:11.198 --> 32:13.492
And they look just like real legs.

32:13.617 --> 32:15.828
They are real legs, silly.

32:15.911 --> 32:17.830
- What did you expect?
- Okay, I don't know,

32:17.913 --> 32:19.331
but certainly not this.

32:19.456 --> 32:21.041
How do you do that?

32:22.126 --> 32:26.171
My people have always had the 
power to shift from sea to land.

32:27.214 --> 32:29.049
So long as we're not out of the water

32:29.174 --> 32:32.136
- for too long that is.
- What happens?

32:33.387 --> 32:34.638
Then we can't go back.

32:37.349 --> 32:39.560
So, what now?

32:41.270 --> 32:43.939
I don't know. I've never had 
a human friend before.

32:45.107 --> 32:47.251
What do humans do?

32:48.318 --> 32:49.903
I'll show you, come on.

32:50.029 --> 32:52.364
- You sure?
- Of course, yeah!

32:52.489 --> 32:54.783
Yeah, you'll love it.
I promise, come on.

32:54.908 --> 32:56.618
If you say so.

33:56.929 --> 33:58.972
So, what's it like?

34:00.099 --> 34:01.600
Out there?

34:03.602 --> 34:05.813
Like home.

34:05.938 --> 34:08.982
You know? I think my grandpa 
feels that way too.

34:09.108 --> 34:13.362
I don't know, just... more at 
home than on the water.

34:14.612 --> 34:16.322
But he's getting old now,

34:16.447 --> 34:19.243
so we moved back here
to try to keep him on dry land.

34:19.326 --> 34:21.704
Well, as much as possible anyways.

34:21.829 --> 34:23.789
How's that going so far?

34:24.915 --> 34:26.125
Not too great actually.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.424
- Do you like it?
- What?

34:33.549 --> 34:37.553
- Living on land?
- I don't know.

34:37.678 --> 34:40.264
I guess I didn't really thought about it.

34:40.347 --> 34:42.558
I've never seen very much of land.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.728
Tell you what.

34:46.853 --> 34:49.356
I'll show you some of my world.

34:49.481 --> 34:51.650
And I'll show you some of mine!

34:51.734 --> 34:52.985
Okay!

35:01.368 --> 35:03.662
- Here, I'm coming.
- Come on in, Ryan.

35:05.664 --> 35:06.999
Okay.

35:10.419 --> 35:13.881
- This is absolutely crazy!
- It's perfect.

35:16.717 --> 35:18.552
Wow!

35:19.720 --> 35:22.723
So, like, you can breathe under water?

35:22.848 --> 35:26.101
- No. We're not fish, silly.
- Oh.

35:26.226 --> 35:28.854
Think of us like dolphins.
We come up for air.

35:28.937 --> 35:30.939
We can just hold our breath for a really long time.

35:32.358 --> 35:34.193
Oh, wow.

35:34.318 --> 35:36.445
Yeah, I guess that would make sense.

35:36.570 --> 35:39.198
My dad can hold his breath 
for a really long time too.

35:39.323 --> 35:41.617
That's why he got to free diving
when he was younger.

35:41.742 --> 35:44.542
Yeah, apparently, I can hold 
my breath for pretty long too.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.954
Yeah?

35:46.080 --> 35:49.124
One of these days, we'll have 
to find out just how long.

35:49.249 --> 35:51.418
Yeah, I'd like that!

35:51.543 --> 35:55.422
You know? Your family seems to 
have an affinity for the water.

35:55.547 --> 35:58.300
Maybe you're not such landlubbers after all.

35:59.343 --> 36:00.969
Ow! Ow!

36:01.095 --> 36:03.889
- What's wrong?
- Something... something stung me!

36:05.891 --> 36:07.393
It's just a jellyfish!

36:07.518 --> 36:09.436
That's easy for you to say!

36:09.561 --> 36:11.063
Here!

36:12.147 --> 36:13.190
Get on land.

36:14.608 --> 36:15.609
Okay.

36:20.823 --> 36:22.700
Ow, I'm hurt so bad!

36:24.743 --> 36:26.203
Hurt so bad, ow!

36:29.540 --> 36:30.541
Ow!

36:30.666 --> 36:31.709
What are you doing?

36:31.834 --> 36:33.168
I can fix it.

36:35.796 --> 36:37.673
Trust me.

37:07.494 --> 37:10.581
How...?
How did you do that?

37:12.207 --> 37:16.003
Did anyone ever tell you 
you ask a lot of questions?

37:17.129 --> 37:19.381
Yeah. All the time, actually.

37:20.758 --> 37:22.760
I don't know, it's just an energy

37:22.885 --> 37:24.678
my people have always had.

37:24.803 --> 37:26.180
The power to heal.

37:28.849 --> 37:30.642
Are you okay?

37:30.768 --> 37:34.188
Yeah, I'm just... just tired.

37:35.689 --> 37:39.318
It takes a lot out of us to
heal another living thing.

37:40.861 --> 37:42.905
Yeah, I can imagine.

37:44.656 --> 37:47.910
Maybe that's enough for the visitor 
exchange program for one day?

37:56.460 --> 37:57.753
Two days?

37:57.878 --> 37:59.880
Yeah, gotta head out to deeper waters.

38:00.005 --> 38:01.245
But... what about Ryan?

38:01.340 --> 38:03.258
I can't just leave her alone for two days.

38:03.384 --> 38:05.052
Why not?
She's perfectly capable.

38:05.177 --> 38:08.514
I left you longer when 
you were about her age.

38:08.639 --> 38:10.224
Yeah, I... I know.

38:10.349 --> 38:12.935
Look... Dad, I, I can't do that,
okay?

38:13.060 --> 38:14.144
She's... she's just a kid.

38:15.187 --> 38:16.438
Okay, bring her with.

38:16.563 --> 38:18.357
It's about time she learned how to fish anyway.

38:18.482 --> 38:19.983
Do her some good.

38:20.109 --> 38:22.528
Yeah, I'm sure she'll love it; 
seeing as how much she loves eating fish.

38:22.653 --> 38:24.530
Hey, you do what you want, okay?

38:24.613 --> 38:28.242
But I'm heading out first thing 
in the morning, with you or without you.

39:04.653 --> 39:05.863
Hey, hi.

39:05.946 --> 39:08.198
Hi, Matt. Wow.

39:08.282 --> 39:11.910
I don't see you for 20 years 
and now 2 visits in 2 days.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.788
You must really like the milkshake.

39:14.913 --> 39:17.958
I do... I, I love your milkshakes.

39:18.083 --> 39:20.544
- I mean,...
- Coffee?

39:20.669 --> 39:22.463
Yes. Coffee.

39:22.588 --> 39:24.423
Um, but also hey...

39:24.548 --> 39:27.092
I also have a huge favor to ask you.

39:28.510 --> 39:30.054
Okay.

39:32.639 --> 39:35.809
Jenna, I really, really apprecite this.

39:35.934 --> 39:37.478
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

39:37.603 --> 39:39.438
- We girls know how to have fun.
- Yeah.

39:39.563 --> 39:42.816
Alright. And you just behave yourself, okay?

39:42.941 --> 39:44.985
Well, that's not necessarily fun, Dad.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.279
Thank you.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.282
Okay.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.400
You know, you're really 
just adding to the list of things 

39:55.454 --> 39:56.814
that you have to make up for, right?

39:56.914 --> 40:00.209
Please. I'm in enough trouble as it is.

40:00.334 --> 40:01.543
Just don't get me into anymore.

40:02.961 --> 40:05.422
- Be safe. Catch a big one.
- Bye, Dad.

40:06.799 --> 40:08.425
Yeah, I got it.

40:08.509 --> 40:09.677
Thanks.

40:09.802 --> 40:11.887
So, big plans for today?

40:12.012 --> 40:14.181
I'm gonna go meet a friend
and hang out at the beach.

40:14.306 --> 40:16.975
Cool. Well, when you're done,
if you guys want to come back,

40:17.059 --> 40:19.099
I'll teach you how to make 
my world famous cupcakes.

40:19.186 --> 40:20.854
- Sweet.
- That's the idea.

41:01.478 --> 41:03.397
Okay, so what do you want to see today?

41:04.982 --> 41:06.316
Everything.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.111
Okay, well, that's kind 
of a tall order, but

41:09.236 --> 41:13.032
how about we start with this dress?

41:14.324 --> 41:16.118
Human clothes!

41:16.243 --> 41:17.578
I think it should fit.

41:17.703 --> 41:19.413
- Okay.
- Come on!

41:28.005 --> 41:31.300
Jay! Take over.

41:31.425 --> 41:33.052
Keep going uphill.

41:35.137 --> 41:36.680
So, what do we go for?

41:44.855 --> 41:47.024
We're not out here to fish at all, are we?

41:47.107 --> 41:48.609
You know what, Jay?
Turn the boat around.

41:48.734 --> 41:50.694
- We're going home!
- You're not in charge here!

41:50.819 --> 41:52.780
You wanna know why there's 
no more fish in this bay?

41:52.863 --> 41:55.616
Because you and all your greedy fishermen 
friends fished this place bone-dry!

41:55.741 --> 41:57.701
Oh, you think you're so smart, huh?

41:57.785 --> 42:00.245
You've got all the answers?
Well, you don't know anything!

42:00.371 --> 42:02.706
Just wait! You'll find out.

42:04.166 --> 42:06.043
You'll find out.

42:13.801 --> 42:15.969
What do you think? 
Does it look okay?

42:16.095 --> 42:17.596
Okay? Are you kidding?

42:17.721 --> 42:19.515
It looks better on you than it does on me.

42:19.640 --> 42:21.433
This is so fun.

42:21.558 --> 42:23.769
I've never tried on clothes like these before.

42:23.852 --> 42:25.604
I think I just figured out what we'll do today.

42:26.647 --> 42:27.648
What?

42:27.731 --> 42:29.483
Shopping.

42:29.608 --> 42:31.360
Yay!

42:31.485 --> 42:32.861
What's "shopping"?

42:33.904 --> 42:35.447
More and more clothes!

42:36.490 --> 42:37.491
Let's go.

42:44.540 --> 42:45.540
How about this one?

42:46.625 --> 42:50.087
- Are you sure?
- Of course. It would be great on you.

42:50.170 --> 42:51.964
- You really think so?
- Definitely.

42:52.047 --> 42:53.447
- Okay, I'll try it.
- Please!

44:01.408 --> 44:03.702
- ... real at all.
- No.

44:05.496 --> 44:08.624
- It doesn't even look real.
- There's no way that's real.

44:10.501 --> 44:12.378
That's a cool kind of family photo.

44:13.504 --> 44:16.090
So, do you have brothers or sisters?

44:16.215 --> 44:18.967
- No, I'm an only child.
- Me too.

44:22.096 --> 44:26.725
My father and grandfather were both 
taken by the sea a long time ago.

44:26.850 --> 44:28.352
Around the time I was born.

44:29.728 --> 44:33.899
- I'm really sorry, Coral.
- That's life, I guess.

44:34.024 --> 44:38.237
Now it's just my mother, and grandmother,
and the rest of our people.

44:42.032 --> 44:43.367
I lost my mom...

44:45.077 --> 44:46.203
about 8 years ago.

44:48.455 --> 44:49.623
I get it.

44:53.085 --> 44:56.880
I believe that wherever our loved ones
go after they die,

44:58.090 --> 44:59.800
they can still see us.

45:01.427 --> 45:02.594
Me too.

45:06.223 --> 45:08.063
- I like the green hair on this one.
- I love that.

45:10.185 --> 45:12.229
Is that what you think we do?

45:12.312 --> 45:14.231
Sit on a rock, brushing our hair all day?

45:14.314 --> 45:17.317
Actually, most people don't 
even think you exist, but...

45:17.443 --> 45:19.570
- Oh.
- How does it not get tangled?

45:19.653 --> 45:22.114
- Teach me your ways.
- Yeah, it gets tangled.

45:23.615 --> 45:26.118
So, do you have any legends about us?

45:26.243 --> 45:30.122
Well... I wouldn't call 
them legends exactly.

45:31.915 --> 45:33.625
Why don't we listen to some of your music,

45:33.751 --> 45:35.753
- or any games, or anything?
- Tell me.

45:40.049 --> 45:44.470
My people aren't exactly 
allowed to interact with humans.

45:46.013 --> 45:48.974
In fact, it's...
strictly forbidden.

45:50.642 --> 45:51.852
Forbidden?

45:53.771 --> 45:56.774
That's just the way it's been for centuries.

45:56.899 --> 46:00.486
My grandmother always warned me that
humans can be selfish and cruel.

46:01.653 --> 46:04.907
But not you, Ryan.

46:05.032 --> 46:08.410
In fact, if they only got to know you,
maybe they'd change their minds.

46:12.790 --> 46:15.626
Then why can't we do that?
Why can't you take me there

46:15.709 --> 46:17.503
and we can show them that our people can co-exist

46:17.628 --> 46:19.713
and not only co-exist, but be friends.

46:21.548 --> 46:25.135
I want that but that's just it, Ryan.

46:25.219 --> 46:27.554
If I bring you there,...

46:27.680 --> 46:30.307
they might not let us be friends anymore.

46:34.269 --> 46:36.730
They're gonna find out sooner or later anyways.

46:36.855 --> 46:40.234
I feel like it's better to try 
before they ground you, or...

46:40.359 --> 46:42.277
Is that different under water?

46:42.403 --> 46:44.905
- Do they have different punishment rules?
- A little bit.

46:47.866 --> 46:48.866
Can we?

46:50.202 --> 46:51.578
Can we try?

46:52.705 --> 46:56.542
Look, okay...
say we were to do this.

46:58.335 --> 47:01.714
How would you get to the island?

47:01.839 --> 47:04.299
Your dad could maybe do it as a free diver,

47:04.425 --> 47:09.555
but... But you'd have to hold 
your breath for a really long time.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.973
Like, how long?

47:12.683 --> 47:16.061
Like, really long.

47:19.606 --> 47:21.358
Practice can make you perfect.

47:27.614 --> 47:30.492
Just over 10 minutes!

47:30.617 --> 47:34.955
That's really good, Ryan!
Well, for a human anyway.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.750
I can do better. I know I can.
Can we go again?

47:39.001 --> 47:40.044
Okay.

47:52.973 --> 47:54.600
This oughta do it.

48:00.647 --> 48:04.068
- What's that?
- It's called a wetsuit.

48:04.151 --> 48:06.195
Scuba divers and surfers use them.

48:08.072 --> 48:10.032
Why do you need a suit to get wet?

48:10.157 --> 48:12.117
It keeps you warm, silly.

48:12.242 --> 48:14.703
You really think you'll need it?

48:14.828 --> 48:17.539
Let's just say you and I have
very different concepts of

48:17.665 --> 48:19.541
of what constitutes cold water.

48:20.626 --> 48:22.086
Can I help you girls with anything?

48:23.128 --> 48:25.589
- I'm good.
- Hi.

48:26.632 --> 48:27.966
Hi.

48:28.092 --> 48:30.928
- I'm... I'm Zack.
- I'm Coral.

48:31.011 --> 48:33.472
- Oh, duh. Hi.
- It's a handshake.

48:36.183 --> 48:38.352
Hi. I'm Ryan.

48:38.477 --> 48:41.563
I'm gonna be over here looking at things.

48:41.689 --> 48:45.109
Okay, if you want to try on that wetsuit,
there is a changing room right there.

48:46.193 --> 48:47.486
Even better.

48:49.947 --> 48:51.156
So,...

48:53.033 --> 48:54.159
you new around town?

48:54.243 --> 48:56.412
I mean, I haven't really seen you around before.

48:57.454 --> 48:59.623
My family's been here for years.

48:59.707 --> 49:04.003
I guess I don't get out much,
but that's been changing lately.

49:04.128 --> 49:07.339
Okay, right on. That's cool.

49:09.383 --> 49:12.344
Anyway, there's this beach barbecue thing

49:12.469 --> 49:15.180
and you should totally come.

49:15.264 --> 49:17.099
You and your friends.

49:19.601 --> 49:22.980
Yeah, I guess we'll be there.

49:23.063 --> 49:24.815
- We'll... we'll be there.
- Yeah? Okay.

49:24.898 --> 49:25.899
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

49:25.983 --> 49:27.985
Well, if you need anything else,

49:28.110 --> 49:29.820
- just let me know.
- Okay.

49:29.903 --> 49:31.223
- See you around ...
- See you.

49:34.158 --> 49:36.243
It's good.
It's... It's all fine.

49:37.327 --> 49:39.079
- I'll see you.
- See you.

49:40.998 --> 49:43.792
Oh my God! I've never talked
to a human boy before!

49:43.917 --> 49:45.502
You like him, don't you?

49:46.587 --> 49:48.630
- Stop it!
- What?

49:48.756 --> 49:51.133
There's no kissing in the sea?
No merboys?

49:51.258 --> 49:53.510
You know what?
Why don't you try this thing on already.

49:53.594 --> 49:55.888
- We're gonna start our trial or what?
- Changing the subject.

49:55.971 --> 49:59.475
Definitely like him.
And hold your horses.

49:59.600 --> 50:02.561
- Hey, Ryan.
- Yes?

50:02.686 --> 50:05.481
What's a beach barbecue, by the way?

50:05.606 --> 50:07.274
They're not gonna hurt the beach, are they?

50:07.399 --> 50:08.776
Go.

50:08.901 --> 50:09.901
Okay.

50:17.951 --> 50:19.661
You ready for this?

50:19.787 --> 50:21.038
Yeah.

50:22.122 --> 50:23.332
Then, follow me.

50:29.463 --> 50:30.798
Hey, wait up!

52:08.395 --> 52:09.395
Hey.

52:09.480 --> 52:12.066
Hey. Where's your friend?

52:12.191 --> 52:13.525
I thought we were gonna make cupcakes?

52:13.609 --> 52:15.152
Oh, she had to go home.

52:15.277 --> 52:16.403
Oh.

52:17.696 --> 52:19.406
I'm still up for it though.

52:21.700 --> 52:22.743
Great.

52:36.465 --> 52:37.675
Come on.

52:39.468 --> 52:40.468
Come on!

52:44.890 --> 52:46.350
Little light reading?

52:48.310 --> 52:49.395
Yep.

52:51.021 --> 52:54.692
Hey, you don't...

52:54.775 --> 52:57.236
You don't believe all this stuff, do you?

52:58.445 --> 53:00.197
I don't know, man.

53:01.699 --> 53:03.575
I never used to.

53:05.744 --> 53:07.579
But you see things when you're out in the ocean.

53:09.540 --> 53:11.417
Things you can't always explain.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.294
Come on. I think you've 
been out here too long.

53:15.963 --> 53:16.964
Yeah, maybe.

53:18.716 --> 53:23.595
Or maybe there's more to life than we know.
The ocean's a big part of that.

53:24.972 --> 53:27.141
Ryan said the same thing.

53:29.143 --> 53:30.602
Smart kid.

53:32.354 --> 53:33.605
A little oil...

53:37.526 --> 53:38.902
- There we go.
- Ready.

53:38.986 --> 53:40.571
- You can dump that in. Aha.
- Straight in the middle?

53:42.156 --> 53:44.700
Very good. Mix it up a little bit.

53:48.245 --> 53:51.707
Right. Now pour this water 
in while you're mixing.

53:51.832 --> 53:55.878
- Stir, stir.
- Just keep going. Very good.

53:57.087 --> 53:59.673
And then just add a...

53:59.798 --> 54:05.888
pinch of salt in to bring out the flavor.

54:09.433 --> 54:10.809
Are you still with me, sweetie?

54:12.728 --> 54:15.981
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I just fazed for a minute.

54:16.106 --> 54:17.816
Thinking about your dad and your grandpa?

54:17.900 --> 54:21.028
I'm sure they're fine.
They know what they're doing.

54:21.153 --> 54:23.822
No, it's... it's not them.

54:25.074 --> 54:26.241
Your new friend?

54:28.410 --> 54:29.662
Sort of.

54:33.499 --> 54:34.500
Hey, Jenna.

54:37.086 --> 54:39.338
Can I ask you something?

54:39.421 --> 54:41.173
Anything.

54:41.298 --> 54:43.342
But promise you won't laugh.

54:43.467 --> 54:45.177
I cross my heart.

54:50.015 --> 54:55.229
Have you ever seen a... mermaid?

54:58.399 --> 55:00.359
A mermaid, you say?

55:01.652 --> 55:04.363
Yeah,... really sounds crazy.

55:04.446 --> 55:05.446
Once.

55:06.865 --> 55:08.242
Maybe.

55:08.367 --> 55:14.081
Just... maybe once I did.
A very long time ago.

55:14.206 --> 55:16.208
Really? What do you remember?

55:17.584 --> 55:21.714
Well, I was... about your age,

55:21.797 --> 55:26.635
and I was swimming in the secluded cove of
Morro Beach.

55:26.760 --> 55:27.970
It's not far from here.

55:28.053 --> 55:32.391
I used to love to dive,
as deep as I could go,

55:32.474 --> 55:35.936
just explore the exotic ocean world out there.

55:37.813 --> 55:39.523
And that's when I saw her.

55:40.649 --> 55:45.404
This beautiful woman with hair like anything
I've ever seen before.

55:46.947 --> 55:49.491
Way beneath the surface.

55:52.745 --> 55:55.372
And then, as quickly as 
she appeared, she was gone.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.086
Anyway...

56:03.380 --> 56:07.760
It was probably just some 
childhood fantasy, I guess.

56:07.885 --> 56:11.263
- An illusion.
- It wasn't an illusion, Jenna.

56:14.808 --> 56:16.727
Mermaids are real.

56:41.418 --> 56:43.837
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:43.962 --> 56:46.048
I was just writing you a note.
Are you hungry?

56:46.131 --> 56:48.592
There's cupcakes in the fridge.
They turned out very well.

56:50.135 --> 56:51.815
Just do me a favor and don't tell your dad

56:51.845 --> 56:53.931
that you ate cupcakes for breakfast, okay?

56:54.056 --> 56:58.102
And since we are doing this 
whole "keeping secrets" thing,

56:58.227 --> 57:01.480
can our little chat about "you know what"
be one of those?

57:01.563 --> 57:03.440
My lips are sealed.

57:03.524 --> 57:06.068
Good because I don't really think 
my dad needs to know about that one either.

57:07.319 --> 57:09.988
- Big plans for the day?
- Actually, yes.

57:10.072 --> 57:12.116
Coral and I are gonna head down to the beach.

57:12.241 --> 57:15.035
Coral. Is that your new friend?

57:15.160 --> 57:16.704
Yeah.

57:16.829 --> 57:19.665
Alright. Have fun.

57:19.790 --> 57:22.459
Just don't swim too far from the shore.

57:22.543 --> 57:24.044
I will do my best.

57:29.049 --> 57:30.509
Keep walking.

57:31.593 --> 57:34.638
- Hey, Zack!
- Ryan, what are you doing?

57:34.763 --> 57:37.516
Hey, Coral.
Are you all doing anything today?

57:37.599 --> 57:38.767
Because I can like,...

57:48.068 --> 57:50.487
You know? I'll just see you around.

57:57.828 --> 58:02.041
You did great yesterday, but today, 
we're gonna stay under even longer.

58:02.166 --> 58:03.166
You ready?

58:04.418 --> 58:07.796
I don't actually have to wait
45 minutes after eating, do I?

58:09.048 --> 58:10.507
That's just a myth.

58:10.591 --> 58:12.926
Well, so were you until a few days ago.

58:13.052 --> 58:16.347
- Come on, this'll be fun.
- Okay, okay.

59:05.854 --> 59:07.898
Where...?
Where are we, Coral?

59:08.023 --> 59:10.359
We're at the outskirts of the island.

59:10.442 --> 59:15.030
There. Just a little while longer.
You're gonna love it, I promise.

59:37.469 --> 59:38.554
We made it.

59:45.227 --> 59:46.270
Coral?

59:47.312 --> 59:48.647
This place is deserted.

59:50.024 --> 59:52.192
What is this?
Why did you bring me here?

59:53.277 --> 59:55.738
This is my people's greatest secret.

59:55.863 --> 59:59.533
Hidden away from humanity
in plain sight for centuries.

59:59.658 --> 01:00:00.951
What?

01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:11.837
Your hand has so many powers!

01:00:17.343 --> 01:00:18.802
What have you done, Coral?

01:00:18.927 --> 01:00:21.847
Mother, I wanted you to meet my friend.

01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:24.933
- My very best friend: Ryan.
- Hi!

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.271
You know better than to
bring a human here.

01:00:29.355 --> 01:00:32.399
It goes against our most 
ancient and sacred laws.

01:00:32.524 --> 01:00:36.612
But we can co-exist with humans.
She's the proof.

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:40.240
She's been showing me their ways 
and I've been showing her ours.

01:00:40.366 --> 01:00:44.078
This proves nothing except that 
you have put us in grave danger.

01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:50.542
- She may bring others.
- No, she would never do that.

01:00:50.626 --> 01:00:52.836
I promise. She can be trusted.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.297
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you
and I would never tell anyone.

01:00:55.381 --> 01:00:56.382
I promise.

01:00:58.008 --> 01:01:01.136
Our entire survival
depends on your kind

01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:03.889
believing us to be nothing 
more than myths.

01:01:03.972 --> 01:01:06.517
You wouldn't want to jeopardize that,
now would you, Ryan?

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:07.642
I would never.

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:14.483
Then, you may be able to...

01:01:19.196 --> 01:01:20.698
Stay here.

01:01:23.701 --> 01:01:24.994
I shouldn't have come here.

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.286
I've gotten you in trouble.

01:01:27.329 --> 01:01:29.748
It's not me I'm worried about.

01:01:32.876 --> 01:01:34.378
Thaleia wants to see you.

01:01:37.006 --> 01:01:38.215
Both of you.

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:45.597
- So, who's Thaleia?
- Our queen.

01:01:47.057 --> 01:01:48.809
And my grandmother.

01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:51.395
- Your grandmother's the queen?
- Shh.

01:01:52.438 --> 01:01:54.023
That is so cool.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.533
Wow. This is amazing.

01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:08.078
This is amazing.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.975
Tell her what I told your mom.

01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:33.354
No. You mustn't speak in here 
unless you're spoken to first.

01:02:33.479 --> 01:02:34.479
Shh.

01:02:42.988 --> 01:02:44.782
Come closer, child.

01:02:46.825 --> 01:02:48.661
Not you, Coral.

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:50.913
Her.

01:03:02.508 --> 01:03:04.385
How did you come to be here, child?

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:09.848
Coral showed me the way.

01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:15.104
But how?

01:03:15.229 --> 01:03:17.106
You did not come by boat.

01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:22.569
We swam from the mainland.

01:03:25.614 --> 01:03:28.075
You have been exposed to our world.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.663
Your knowledge of our existence 
has put my people in danger.

01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:35.666
- I mean no harm, Your...
- It's not her fault.

01:03:35.749 --> 01:03:37.751
- I was the one who too...
- Silence.

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:43.132
What's done is done.

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:44.967
For this, you can never go back.

01:03:46.552 --> 01:03:47.886
We can be together.

01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:53.559
No. No, I would miss my family.

01:03:53.642 --> 01:03:57.604
- I can't...
- I'm sorry, child.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:00.566
But to protect my people, it must be so.

01:04:02.359 --> 01:04:05.112
Don't you want to be together?

01:04:05.237 --> 01:04:08.741
I do, but...
But not like this.

01:04:09.783 --> 01:04:13.037
I need my family, Coral,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.249
just like you need yours,
and... and my dad

01:04:17.374 --> 01:04:21.128
- and my grandfather...
- Your family does not deserve you!

01:04:22.588 --> 01:04:24.423
- Her grandfather...
- No.

01:04:24.548 --> 01:04:26.842
He's the fisherman you warned us about.

01:04:26.925 --> 01:04:29.428
She cannot be allowed to return.

01:04:31.305 --> 01:04:33.182
Is this true, child?

01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:44.360
Come closer.

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:47.696
Closer.

01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:54.286
You look like him.

01:04:58.457 --> 01:04:59.625
So beautiful.

01:05:03.545 --> 01:05:05.589
You... you know him?

01:05:07.341 --> 01:05:08.634
Once.

01:05:09.968 --> 01:05:12.054
A long time ago.

01:05:13.931 --> 01:05:17.476
- Before...
- Before?

01:05:20.396 --> 01:05:26.110
Before his heart was broken...
and he became enheartened to the sea.

01:05:28.654 --> 01:05:32.491
And because of that, we have kept 
the fish away from these waters.

01:05:32.616 --> 01:05:36.829
To protect the ebb and flo of 
nature and its delicate balance.

01:05:36.912 --> 01:05:40.290
He and his people have overfished these waters.

01:05:40.374 --> 01:05:42.626
Taken, not replenished.

01:05:47.256 --> 01:05:49.967
Please, don't take me away from my family.

01:05:53.679 --> 01:05:55.973
Do not cry, young one.

01:05:57.933 --> 01:05:59.018
All will be well.

01:06:05.941 --> 01:06:08.485
You will take the girl with you back to her home.

01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:11.321
And if she betrays her word?

01:06:13.615 --> 01:06:16.660
She won't.
Will you, child?

01:06:17.953 --> 01:06:22.791
I promise.
With all my heart.

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:26.211
You are never to return here again

01:06:27.546 --> 01:06:29.715
nor even speak of our existence.

01:06:36.055 --> 01:06:41.143
It is forbidden for humans 
and merfolk to mingle.

01:06:45.606 --> 01:06:47.191
Now go.

01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:06.585
Ryan! Ryan!

01:07:14.051 --> 01:07:16.595
I can't believe I'm losing my best friend.

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:20.140
We may be forbidden from being friends,

01:07:21.642 --> 01:07:24.186
but you will always be my sister.

01:07:37.282 --> 01:07:40.661
Coral, this means a lot to me.

01:07:40.786 --> 01:07:43.163
There's one part of me
that will always be with you.

01:08:01.682 --> 01:08:02.975
Good-bye, Coral.

01:08:33.087 --> 01:08:35.841
Ahead! Dolphins!

01:08:35.924 --> 01:08:37.926
Where there's dolphins, there's mermaids!

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.636
Jay, come here!
Take over!

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.182
- Get ready to toss the nets.
- No, no, no, Dad. No.

01:08:43.307 --> 01:08:44.600
I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:08:44.683 --> 01:08:47.185
- Just toss the nets!
- Dad, you're acting crazy.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.354
It's not happening. No!

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.189
Okay, okay, I'll do it myself.

01:08:51.273 --> 01:08:53.024
- Now get out of the way.
- Dad, stop.

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:55.277
Dad! Dad!

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:58.572
Jay, call the coast guard now!

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:00.457
Dad, just take it easy, okay?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.368
Oh, man.

01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:33.732
Good-bye.

01:09:33.857 --> 01:09:35.401
Good luck, young one.

01:09:45.243 --> 01:09:48.372
Finish putting the cash in the office 
and just lock everything up for me?

01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:53.377
Ryan, honey, where have you been?

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.005
Oh my God!
I've been looking everywhere for you.

01:09:57.089 --> 01:10:00.509
Sorry, I was...
just swimming with Coral.

01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:05.556
What's wrong?

01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:09.435
It's your grandfather, honey.

01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:12.521
There's been an accident.

01:10:13.605 --> 01:10:14.940
Let's go.

01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:24.700
Are you gonna be alright if I step away for a while?

01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:28.620
- Yeah.
- Ok.

01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:36.920
So, I'm just gonna go lock up the cafÃ©
and I'll be back soon, okay?

01:10:37.046 --> 01:10:38.213
Okay.

01:10:38.297 --> 01:10:40.257
Your dad will be here in about 45 minutes.

01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:49.891
Don't go.

01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:52.311
Don't leave me.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:57.733
Grandpa?

01:11:02.738 --> 01:11:04.281
Grandpa?

01:11:08.327 --> 01:11:10.037
Ryan.

01:11:11.372 --> 01:11:12.665
Where am I?

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.502
It's... it's okay.
You're in the hospital.

01:11:16.627 --> 01:11:17.670
Huh?

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.546
You... you passed out, Grandpa.

01:11:22.174 --> 01:11:23.842
No, you need to rest.

01:11:23.926 --> 01:11:25.469
- No!
- You need to...

01:11:25.594 --> 01:11:26.845
You need to rest!

01:11:29.515 --> 01:11:30.683
That necklace.

01:11:32.309 --> 01:11:34.144
Where did you get that?

01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:41.193
It's just something I bought 
while I was shopping.

01:11:41.318 --> 01:11:43.195
No, no, no.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.031
No, we both know that's not true.

01:11:47.408 --> 01:11:49.368
You've seen them, haven't you?

01:11:50.869 --> 01:11:52.371
Yes, you know.

01:12:00.087 --> 01:12:01.547
Do you know where they are?

01:12:03.382 --> 01:12:05.551
Grandpa, I... I can't.

01:12:05.676 --> 01:12:08.470
I made a promise...

01:12:08.554 --> 01:12:11.640
- You don't understand.
- Then, help me to.

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:20.691
It was a long, long time ago.

01:12:23.402 --> 01:12:24.778
I was a young man.

01:12:24.903 --> 01:12:29.825
Back then, fish would practically leap off
the lines and into the boat.

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:33.954
One day, I caught something big.

01:12:34.079 --> 01:12:37.041
At first, I thought it was a dolphÃ­n,

01:12:37.166 --> 01:12:42.004
but as I reeled it in,
I saw exactly what I caught.

01:12:42.087 --> 01:12:44.006
A mermaid.

01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:46.842
I was immediately struck by her beauty.

01:12:46.925 --> 01:12:50.763
It was as if all the colors 
of the ocean were in her eyes.

01:12:51.972 --> 01:12:53.557
I was in love.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.976
We both were.

01:12:59.772 --> 01:13:03.400
We agreed... we had to keep
our love a secret.

01:13:03.484 --> 01:13:07.488
I was a fisherman.
Their worst kind of enemy.

01:13:07.613 --> 01:13:12.117
If people knew that mermaids were real,

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.912
they would destroy them.

01:13:16.622 --> 01:13:19.375
So I promised to keep their secret.

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:21.585
For a time, we were happy.

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:26.674
I wanted nothing more than to 
be with her for the rest of my life.

01:13:26.799 --> 01:13:28.425
But it wasn't meant to be.

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:30.302
Her father had found out about us

01:13:30.386 --> 01:13:33.722
and forbid me to see me 
because she was to marry another.

01:13:33.806 --> 01:13:36.392
She told me she was also heir to her throne,

01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:39.061
that she couldn't betray her people.

01:13:39.144 --> 01:13:40.646
I pleaded with her to come back.

01:13:40.771 --> 01:13:43.315
I returned to the beach every day,
where we met,

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.318
hoping and praying that she'd come back to me.

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.905
And she never did.

01:13:51.156 --> 01:13:52.574
She never came back.

01:13:52.658 --> 01:13:56.203
Days turned to weeks, 
weeks then turned to months

01:13:56.328 --> 01:14:01.417
and... love turned to anger.

01:14:02.835 --> 01:14:05.504
So, I fished.

01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:08.132
I set lines,
laid traps, fish,

01:14:08.215 --> 01:14:12.302
scouring, looking for any 
sign of her or her people.

01:14:12.428 --> 01:14:14.346
And I never saw her again.

01:14:15.597 --> 01:14:20.853
I never saw any of them.
They just... disappeared.

01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:24.940
Then, late, one stormy night,

01:14:25.024 --> 01:14:27.818
I found a baby at my door.

01:14:29.445 --> 01:14:30.654
A son.

01:14:33.824 --> 01:14:35.534
She gave me a son.

01:14:37.911 --> 01:14:39.288
Dad.

01:14:40.789 --> 01:14:44.543
How could she have loved me?
How could she have abandoned me?

01:14:44.668 --> 01:14:46.503
Abandoned him.

01:14:47.838 --> 01:14:52.843
I have to know why, Ryan.

01:14:55.054 --> 01:14:58.640
You have to tell me where they are.

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:07.232
Jay, cast off the bow line!

01:15:10.444 --> 01:15:12.780
- Art, what are you doing?
- Come on, move aside.

01:15:12.905 --> 01:15:14.907
Come on, move aside, Jay.

01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.272
Yeah, I can't let you do it.

01:15:16.367 --> 01:15:18.577
You're in no condition to go back out there.

01:15:18.702 --> 01:15:21.955
I appreciate your concern.
Now get out of the way!

01:15:22.081 --> 01:15:23.791
- Come on.
- I already tried...

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:26.168
Look, it's my boat, alright?

01:15:26.251 --> 01:15:28.420
You either stay on or you get off.

01:15:28.545 --> 01:15:30.255
Either way, I'm going.

01:15:32.841 --> 01:15:35.844
Alright, fine.
But I'm going with you.

01:15:36.929 --> 01:15:38.764
That's my Jay-Jay.

01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:41.058
Is the life raft still on board?

01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:43.102
- Yeah, of course. Why?
- Good.

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:46.897
Come on, cast off the bow line!

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:49.483
1 second.

01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:52.026
Ha.

01:16:12.297 --> 01:16:13.924
Santa Carla Hospital.

01:16:14.008 --> 01:16:15.884
Art Love's room, please?

01:16:15.968 --> 01:16:19.596
Okay, it appears Mr. Love
has checked himself out.

01:16:19.722 --> 01:16:22.099
Checked himself out?
That... That's impossible.

01:16:22.182 --> 01:16:24.101
I'm sorry, but our record 
show that he checked out

01:16:24.184 --> 01:16:25.894
with his granddaughter 
about half an hour ago.

01:16:25.978 --> 01:16:28.981
Okay. Alright, thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:16:30.607 --> 01:16:32.735
Hey, I'm almost back to the hospital.

01:16:32.818 --> 01:16:34.820
- How's your father?
- He's gone.

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.282
- Gone?
- He checked himself out.

01:16:38.365 --> 01:16:41.201
- Ryan's with him.
- Where do you think they went?

01:16:41.327 --> 01:16:43.162
My guess is the dock.

01:16:43.245 --> 01:16:45.914
You don't think he'd come back out, do you?

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:47.333
That's exactly what I think.

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:50.753
Look, there's a tracker on the boat, okay?

01:16:50.836 --> 01:16:53.714
I'm gonna try and access it so 
it can tell us where they are, alright?

01:16:53.839 --> 01:16:57.009
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay, I will be right there.

01:17:11.857 --> 01:17:13.650
Okay, yeah.

01:17:13.734 --> 01:17:15.861
Alright, well, I contacted the coast guard.

01:17:17.029 --> 01:17:18.029
Thanks.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.617
- Any news?
- No, the boat's gone.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.994
I tried calling Jay,
but he isn't picking up.

01:17:24.078 --> 01:17:26.455
There's only about 3 hours 
of day light left.

01:17:26.538 --> 01:17:31.377
I swear, if... If anything happens
to Ryan, I will never forgive myself.

01:17:31.502 --> 01:17:32.711
She's gonna be fine.

01:17:32.795 --> 01:17:34.338
She's strong just like her father.

01:17:38.884 --> 01:17:40.469
- Hey, Art.
- Yeah?

01:17:40.552 --> 01:17:44.390
- What's our heading?
- Due west, towards the channels.

01:17:45.432 --> 01:17:47.810
The channels? Why?

01:17:47.893 --> 01:17:49.311
They're headed to the channel islands.

01:17:49.395 --> 01:17:50.938
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

01:18:05.411 --> 01:18:07.955
- She made it back okay?
- Yes.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.456
Coral...

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:14.044
I know her friendship means 
a great deal to you...

01:18:15.421 --> 01:18:17.339
but your heart will heal in time.

01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:21.927
I'm going for a swim.

01:19:02.343 --> 01:19:04.928
The fisherman!
I have to warn the others!

01:19:38.003 --> 01:19:39.296
What's that?

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.882
Up ahead... What is that?

01:19:43.133 --> 01:19:45.177
Hey! Over there! Look over there!

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:46.887
It's a mermaid!

01:19:49.264 --> 01:19:51.266
It's a mermaid.
It's a mermaid!

01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:52.893
It's caught in the net!

01:19:55.688 --> 01:19:56.939
It's Coral!

01:20:00.526 --> 01:20:01.860
Coral!

01:20:02.987 --> 01:20:04.196
- Please!
- It's all my fault.

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:05.698
- Go, go!
- Please!

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:09.076
- Coral!
- Look at him, look at him.

01:20:14.206 --> 01:20:16.417
Get the hook off! Get it all of it!

01:20:16.542 --> 01:20:18.502
- Get her out of that thing!
- Coral!

01:20:18.627 --> 01:20:20.045
- Oh my God...
- Come on.

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:22.715
- This is all my fault.
- Please. Coral.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.675
- Good job, good job.
- Coral, breathe.

01:20:24.758 --> 01:20:26.218
Coral, please, breathe.

01:20:27.386 --> 01:20:30.097
Coral, don't you die on me!
Please.

01:20:30.222 --> 01:20:31.348
Breathe, breathe!

01:20:31.473 --> 01:20:32.975
Get the net off. Get the net off.

01:20:34.018 --> 01:20:35.978
Come on, breathe, Coral!

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:38.731
Coral, you can't.
Please.

01:20:41.025 --> 01:20:42.109
Coral!

01:20:55.998 --> 01:20:57.041
No, no, no.

01:20:57.124 --> 01:20:58.584
Don't worry.
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:20:58.709 --> 01:21:00.085
- Hey.
- We're not gonna hurt you.

01:21:03.422 --> 01:21:05.758
Ryan. Ryan, you saved me.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.053
I don't... I don't know.

01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:12.181
Maybe I... Maybe I had some of 
your power left in me

01:21:12.264 --> 01:21:14.892
from when you healed me the other day,
but I didn't do anything.

01:21:16.518 --> 01:21:18.771
This had nothing to do with me.

01:21:19.938 --> 01:21:22.566
Its power was inside you all along, Ryan.

01:21:28.364 --> 01:21:29.990
Hang in there, buddy.

01:21:30.115 --> 01:21:31.116
No.

01:21:33.327 --> 01:21:35.120
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Hey! Grandpa!

01:21:38.207 --> 01:21:39.416
Coral, give me your hand!

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.420
We're not strong enough, Ryan.
We can't do it alone.

01:21:46.173 --> 01:21:48.634
The island. We have to get 
him to the island!

01:21:48.759 --> 01:21:51.136
Jay, just trust us!
Please, go! Go!

01:21:56.308 --> 01:21:57.851
Stay with us, Grandpa.

01:22:00.896 --> 01:22:02.856
Come on, buddy. Hang in there, buddy.
We're doing good!

01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:07.987
- Help!
- Breathe, buddy. You're doing good.

01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:19.623
Grandpa, please.
Please, don't leave me.

01:22:19.748 --> 01:22:21.667
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

01:22:25.671 --> 01:22:27.798
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:30.175
I brought you here.
We shouldn't have left.

01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:36.765
Coral. Coral, where is everyone?
Why aren't they coming?

01:22:40.352 --> 01:22:41.645
They're afraid.

01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:47.026
Please!

01:22:48.277 --> 01:22:51.030
Please! Please, help him! He's gonna die!

01:22:52.281 --> 01:22:54.033
- Daddy, he's sick!
- You crazy old man.

01:22:54.116 --> 01:22:55.116
What were you thinking?

01:22:56.702 --> 01:22:57.786
I'm sorry.

01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:02.583
Just take it easy, Pop, alright?
Just... Just take it easy!

01:23:02.708 --> 01:23:04.043
Look, they can help him.

01:23:04.126 --> 01:23:06.045
I know they're here and they have to.

01:23:06.128 --> 01:23:08.714
- Everyone just come out, please!
- Sweetie, there's nobody here.

01:23:08.839 --> 01:23:11.120
There's nothing anybody can do 
until the coast guard gets here.

01:23:12.718 --> 01:23:15.387
Coral, can... can you please try?

01:23:16.847 --> 01:23:18.349
I'll do what I can.

01:23:31.737 --> 01:23:32.737
Stay with us, Pop.

01:23:35.658 --> 01:23:39.370
I can't. His condition is too grave.

01:23:41.246 --> 01:23:43.248
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:47.544
Please, somebody!

01:23:56.428 --> 01:23:57.721
What the...?

01:24:10.859 --> 01:24:11.859
Everyone.

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:34.883
Thaleia?

01:24:34.967 --> 01:24:36.301
Hello, my love.

01:24:40.347 --> 01:24:45.602
- Am I dead?
- No, no. You're very much alive.

01:24:48.731 --> 01:24:50.482
I missed you so much.

01:24:54.153 --> 01:24:56.280
- I was so angry.
- Shh.

01:24:56.405 --> 01:24:57.573
None of that matters now.

01:25:00.451 --> 01:25:03.329
What? Would someone like to tell me what...?

01:25:03.454 --> 01:25:04.997
What I just watched?

01:25:05.122 --> 01:25:06.915
They're mermaids.

01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:11.128
Yeah, right. Of course.

01:25:12.338 --> 01:25:14.340
And I'm sorry.

01:25:16.175 --> 01:25:19.219
I'm sorry for breaking my 
promise not to come back.

01:25:19.345 --> 01:25:21.680
- I didn't know what to do and...
- I'm not.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.995
What a good man you've become.

01:25:47.539 --> 01:25:51.293
Why do I...?
Why do I feel like we've met before?

01:25:53.671 --> 01:25:55.798
Because I've always been there watching.

01:25:57.216 --> 01:25:59.051
From the sea...

01:26:00.135 --> 01:26:01.553
in your dreams.

01:26:03.555 --> 01:26:05.516
You're my son, Matthew.

01:26:29.164 --> 01:26:32.209
Tonight signifies a new beginning.

01:26:32.334 --> 01:26:36.630
A bridge between our worlds...
and theirs.

01:26:37.715 --> 01:26:40.968
This signifies our bond of trust...

01:26:44.513 --> 01:26:45.889
and of family.

01:26:54.773 --> 01:26:57.693
Let the sea breathe new life into this valley.

01:26:57.776 --> 01:27:00.904
That the fish flow through its waters.

01:27:31.352 --> 01:27:34.188
How long do you think they've been down there?
All night?

01:27:34.313 --> 01:27:36.649
I guess they had a lot of catching up to do.

01:27:37.941 --> 01:27:41.153
Love is love no matter how old you are.

01:27:43.113 --> 01:27:44.365
Bye!

01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:46.909
Hey, whoa, whoa, where do you 
think you guys are going?

01:27:46.992 --> 01:27:48.994
Where do you think we're going?

01:27:49.119 --> 01:27:50.829
Alright, well, just be careful, okay?

01:27:50.954 --> 01:27:56.085
I'll take good care of her,... Uncle Matt.

01:27:56.168 --> 01:27:57.169
Have fun!

01:27:57.294 --> 01:28:00.172
Oh, man, it's gonna take some getting used to.

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:04.259
It's how a lot of things are.

01:28:05.844 --> 01:28:07.346
Life's a journey.

01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:36.333
The fish did return to Santa Carla,

01:28:36.417 --> 01:28:40.713
and my dad and granddad each 
began new chapters in their lives.

01:28:44.758 --> 01:28:48.595
And me?
Well, my dad was right all along.

01:28:48.721 --> 01:28:50.848
I grew to love my new home.

01:28:50.973 --> 01:28:53.308
In the end of that magical summer,

01:28:53.392 --> 01:28:56.729
I learned that the ocean wasn't 
just a place of mystery,

01:28:56.854 --> 01:28:58.439
wonder, and secrets.

01:28:58.564 --> 01:29:00.316
I learned that it was a teacher.

01:29:00.399 --> 01:29:05.195
And if you listen hard enough,
you learn about love and forgiveness.

01:29:06.238 --> 01:29:07.573
And in the end,

01:29:07.656 --> 01:29:10.367
maybe that's the most important lesson of all.

01:29:10.451 --> 01:29:13.162
- Hey, Coral!
- Yeah?

01:29:13.245 --> 01:29:17.833
- Friends forever?
- Family forever.
