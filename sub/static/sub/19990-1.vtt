05:20.860 --> 05:23.700
Our sports are too extreme for you dudes.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.280
Maybe we should start you two on something easier.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.320
What games do you dudes like to play?

05:29.360 --> 05:30.400

06:05.320 --> 06:06.760
You're face isn't leaking.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.980
You're just sweating from all the exercise.

Yeah! See?

06:59.160 --> 07:01.940
Extreme sports should be explosive! Boom!

07:01.940 --> 07:03.240
Explosive, huh?

07:03.240 --> 07:05.240
I know just the thing!

07:12.820 --> 07:13.840
Impressed?

07:15.000 --> 07:15.840
No.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.080
Look dudes, to be extreme you gotta go bigger.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.800
Show 'em Drasticals!

07:31.620 --> 07:32.660

Holy Joe!

07:54.540 --> 07:55.400

07:59.320 --> 08:02.580
Now that's how you do extreme! You understand?

08:02.580 --> 08:05.460
I think I do. Is fighting extreme?

08:05.680 --> 08:07.640
Fighting is totally extreme.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.920
I want a clean fight.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.740
I don't wanna see any trash laying around.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.900
We give up!

08:29.560 --> 08:30.380
Fling!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.200
That was close.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.620
Not so fast.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.460
That's not fighting.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.039
Stand aside.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.020
I'll show you how it's done.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.700
Noo! It's dry-clean only!

08:57.280 --> 08:58.540
Avenge me.

09:00.300 --> 09:00.920
Brutal.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.180

09:13.040 --> 09:14.280
Even more brutal!

09:14.820 --> 09:17.660
Now that was extreme, dudes.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.980
- You think you're starting to get it?
- Oh, yeah!

09:20.980 --> 09:22.380
So what else you got?

09:22.380 --> 09:24.760
There is one sport that Patrick's an expert at.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.480
Dumpster diving!

09:45.700 --> 09:47.220
That's not extreme.

09:48.660 --> 09:49.980
How revolting.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.780
Okay, that's kinda extreme.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.140
Not bad.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.800
But the Drasticals will show you how it's done.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.020
Okay artificial hip, don't fail me now.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.360
Extreme!

10:37.840 --> 10:40.740
That is one tough elderly person.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.320
Dude, that was awesome!

10:43.400 --> 10:45.540
What other crazy sports do you dudes play?

10:45.540 --> 10:47.660
Well, there is a very extremely...

10:47.660 --> 10:50.140

11:31.180 --> 11:32.700

11:32.940 --> 11:36.220
These spots are way extreme!

11:36.320 --> 11:37.900
And itchy!

11:38.660 --> 11:39.900
As you can see...

11:40.580 --> 11:42.860
...extweme spowts are the direct...

11:42.860 --> 11:46.600
...bi-product of the most extweme spowts.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.660
Who is that guy?

12:11.140 --> 12:13.520
It's quitting time, SpongeBob.

12:13.620 --> 12:14.840
Go home.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.180
Quitting time!

12:20.180 --> 12:23.380
Go... home!

12:26.100 --> 12:27.780
Oh my. It's time to go home.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.960
Squidward, what are you still doing here?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.400
What am I gonna do with you?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.460
I can't throw you away.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.420
Bleh!

12:48.660 --> 12:51.060
But I do have to throw away the trash.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.240
What's this?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.460
Someone threw away a book.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.600
You shouldn't throw away books.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.360
Sandy, you're a trash monster?

13:22.460 --> 13:23.420
Heck no.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.560
I was breaking a record for rooting around in a trash bin.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.180
It's all right here in...

13:28.180 --> 13:30.420
...The Guinness O' Ripley Enormous Book...

13:30.420 --> 13:33.460

13:33.740 --> 13:35.120

Holding your breath.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.740
- Wow!

13:52.860 --> 13:55.580

13:56.020 --> 13:57.600
World's longest tongue.

That's easy.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.180
106, 107...

14:06.240 --> 14:07.740
Hold tight, Sandy.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.880

- Yeehaw!

14:22.960 --> 14:24.620
Let's see... Yikes!

14:24.620 --> 14:26.400
Sweet mother of Pearl!

14:26.600 --> 14:28.520
Is it dangerous?

14:28.660 --> 14:30.320
Yeah, you could say that.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.860
You have to eat as much chum as you can.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.920
Chum, huh? That's not too bad.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.240
- Raw.
- Raw?!

14:40.260 --> 14:42.900
- You want what?
- One order of chum, please.

14:42.900 --> 14:43.840
Raw.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.500
Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind...

14:47.500 --> 14:50.740
...but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!

14:50.780 --> 14:51.700
Oh yeah?

14:51.760 --> 14:54.520
Well, Charlie Mackeral, the current record holder did.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.460

14:55.940 --> 14:56.960
For 30 seconds.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.060
Well, it's your funeral.

15:05.820 --> 15:07.280
OK, Sandy, eat up.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.240
Please hold this end.

17:39.060 --> 17:42.800
35 feet. Record broken!

17:43.540 --> 17:44.280
Ouch!

17:47.280 --> 17:48.700
Take a picture.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.780
- Say "cheese"!
-  Cheese!

17:58.600 --> 18:00.000
- Picture!
- Here you go.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.080
Thank you.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.780
Next, spiciest chili gargle.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.380
Got it!

18:15.680 --> 18:16.780
You OK?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.280
Do you smell soup?

18:23.420 --> 18:24.700
What's next?

18:25.040 --> 18:27.260
Largest rubber band ball.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.620
Woohoo! What's next?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.780
Most cobras milked.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.660
Say "cheese"!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.040
Cheese!

18:39.620 --> 18:41.040
Nice snakes.

18:42.820 --> 18:43.540
Next!

18:43.760 --> 18:46.180
Most walnuts in mouth.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.260
Just! One! More! Oh, no!

18:53.380 --> 18:54.060
Next!

18:54.220 --> 18:56.440
Most chainsaws juggled.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.740
- OK, shoot!
- Got it!

19:04.900 --> 19:06.900
So, uh, how do you stop?

19:07.100 --> 19:09.180
- What?
- I said "How do you stop?"

19:09.340 --> 19:11.700
- What?
- How do you stop?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.080
Whoa, that's easy.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.320
I just stop...

19:15.480 --> 19:17.300
...then run like heck!

19:17.380 --> 19:18.840
Not that way!

19:22.260 --> 19:24.740
Come on, SpongeBob! Pull yourself together!

19:24.740 --> 19:26.920
We still got a ton of records to break!

19:27.180 --> 19:30.220
Oh yeah! You're gonna love this one!

19:30.320 --> 19:31.360
I don't know, Sandy.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.990
It is getting kinda dangerous.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.700
Come on, you don't need your helmet.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.400
This one's outside!

19:36.600 --> 19:37.720
Follow me.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.640
- Oh my.
- There it is.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.940
The world's largest house of cards!

19:43.080 --> 19:44.180
That's amazing!

19:44.260 --> 19:46.320
- Get in front so I can take a picture.
- Nah.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.100
Let's get a shot from the top!

19:54.560 --> 19:55.340
What the...?

19:56.340 --> 19:57.400
Oh, hey.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.380
It's Solitaire!

19:59.460 --> 20:01.040
I love this game!

20:02.820 --> 20:04.780
I take a touchdown!

20:14.060 --> 20:14.880
What's next?

20:14.960 --> 20:17.260
Um, I think I smell Gary's sandbox...

20:17.260 --> 20:18.440
...better go clean it.

20:18.540 --> 20:19.180
Now!

20:21.180 --> 20:23.920
I think you broke a record today, Gary.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.740
World's Stinkiest Litter box! Eww!

20:28.100 --> 20:29.500
I'm worried about Sandy.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.600
She's got record-breaking fever!

20:31.600 --> 20:32.900
- Meow.
- You're right.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.640
She does need my help.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.160
I must stop this madness!

20:36.240 --> 20:37.860
It's all that book's fault!

20:38.080 --> 20:39.480
The book is evil!

20:39.620 --> 20:41.740
The book must be destroyed!

20:53.660 --> 20:55.800
Why don't you take 5?

20:55.960 --> 20:57.340
I will hold the book.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.140
Thank Neptune's gears.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.380
My wheels are killing me.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.140
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

21:05.140 --> 21:06.520
Get back in line!

21:06.540 --> 21:08.700
I need every available robot for this one.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.260
Most Robots built and destroyed in a day.

21:13.460 --> 21:18.660
656, 657...

21:19.080 --> 21:22.600
Oh, the artificial humanity.

21:24.600 --> 21:29.240
Oh no you don't! We're all in this together!

21:39.220 --> 21:43.360
679. Record broken!

21:44.320 --> 21:46.620
OK. Shut her down!

21:46.760 --> 21:47.980
Oh, my!

21:48.040 --> 21:49.120
What's wrong with you?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.200
My stomach feels funny.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.300
Let's have a look. SpongeBob?!

21:54.340 --> 21:55.580
Oh hey, Sandy.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.300
SpongeBob, what are you doing?

21:58.380 --> 22:00.880
I'm here to save you from... from this book.

22:01.260 --> 22:04.100
I'm going to destroy it before someone gets killed!

22:04.260 --> 22:06.300
I don't wanna lose you, Sandy!

22:06.760 --> 22:08.300
I don't wanna lose you!

22:08.400 --> 22:09.980
Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.160
I'm done with that book!

22:11.260 --> 22:13.300
I've beat every record in here.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.420
In fact, I've been finding the author...

22:15.420 --> 22:17.080
...who verified my evidence.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.340
Thank you.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.240
Oh, my. I see.

22:23.020 --> 22:26.500
Well then... I'm afraid you've broken no records.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.560
- Huh?
- This book is 30 years old.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.040
These records were broken ages ago.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.320
You however have sent a brand new record.

22:35.820 --> 22:39.580
Most injuries sustained while helping a friend.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.740
Good for you, SpongeBob.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.240
Um, hurray!

22:46.680 --> 22:48.640
Say "cheese"!
