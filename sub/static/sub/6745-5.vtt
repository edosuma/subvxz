this message took hard work.

about the messages,

19:13.753 --> 19:16.120
Front desk
traced the call?

19:16.122 --> 19:18.222
Came from a pay phone
at a mini-mart

19:18.224 --> 19:20.992
very near where the murders
happened last night.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.493
Cameras
at the mini-mart?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.561
No.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.530
And, funnily enough,
captain,

19:25.532 --> 19:29.467
you're the second person
to ask me that today.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.469
Am I?

19:35.608 --> 19:38.042
Captain, twizz may be right
for the taco truck homicide,

19:38.044 --> 19:39.877
but he's wrong
for the murders last night.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.045
That was someone else.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.181
How do you know that,
Amy?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.116
Because...

19:47.587 --> 19:49.453
...I have an eyewitness.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.165
Okay, okay.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.034
If you don't want to discuss
your feelings about t.J.,

20:03.036 --> 20:05.136
let's go back
to how you feel about Alice.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.405
Thousands of teenage girls
go missing every year,

20:07.407 --> 20:09.207
and you don't know
any of<i> their</i> names.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.641
Why is
Jane Doe number 38

20:10.643 --> 20:12.176
more important
than all the others?

20:12.178 --> 20:15.880
Because I was --
I was around the investigation.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.016
I...I-I knew about it
as it was going on.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.551
You've been around
a<i> lot</i> of investigations.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.787
Yeah, but none of
the other victims needed me.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.288
Alice doesn't need you,
either.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.523
Alice is dead.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.125
Telling her story
won't change that.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.360
No, no, I-it<i> will</i> change,
Dr. Joe.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.429
It will change
how people think of her.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.197
Right now,
Alice is just some girl

20:33.199 --> 20:34.832
who disappeared
off the street

20:34.834 --> 20:37.235
because no one cared enough
to help her.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.170
Sure, slider killed her,
yeah,

20:39.172 --> 20:43.174
but -- but Alice also died from
complications related to --

20:43.176 --> 20:46.377
to apathy and neglect.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.546
And you don't have to turn that
back around on me, Dr. Joe.

20:48.548 --> 20:52.016
I already know that that's
my story before Sharon, okay?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.919
I'm...

20:54.921 --> 20:57.154
I'm using my experience

20:57.156 --> 20:59.457
to help me show
how hard it is

20:59.459 --> 21:02.560
for homeless kids
to catch a break.

21:02.562 --> 21:07.131
So, you have an eyewitness
you refuse to identify? Why?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.400
Because doing so
places her in imminent danger.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.602
But I'm having trouble
making a deal with twizz,

21:11.604 --> 21:14.238
and if I don't reveal how
detective Sykes found the gun,

21:14.240 --> 21:15.673
we'll get butchered
in court.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.174
It's all discoverable.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.410
We're positive
twizz isn't responsible

21:19.412 --> 21:22.179
for these three homicides
last night?

21:22.181 --> 21:24.949
According to Amy's info,
which I'm inclined to believe,

21:24.951 --> 21:28.019
we have a new suspect
in these murders.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.154
Jason Albert deray,

21:30.156 --> 21:32.256
known on the streets
as big hazard, sir.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.158
Not to be confused
with li'l hazard

21:34.160 --> 21:36.360
or o.G. Hazard
or just plain hazard.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.095
Apparently,
"hazard" is a title

21:38.097 --> 21:39.664
handed down
through the monster gang

21:39.666 --> 21:41.799
like a-a --
like an earldom or something.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.567
Big hazard was paroled
six weeks ago

21:43.569 --> 21:46.570
after serving 2 1/2 years
on a domestic assault.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.772
His victim in that case

21:47.774 --> 21:49.240
was our female deceased,
Tamara roe.

21:49.242 --> 21:51.008
She broke up
with big hazard

21:51.010 --> 21:52.643
the moment they slammed
his cell door shut, sir.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.314
After which Tamara took up
with our male deceased, breezy.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.316
Provenza:
Explains why they're both dead.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.217
And twice, sir,
in his prior arrests,

22:00.219 --> 22:02.019
he was caught
with Emanuel gaines.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.255
A.K.A.
Our good friend twizz.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.856
Now, if twizz knew
where the gun was stashed,

22:05.858 --> 22:09.427
it is highly probable
that big hazard knew, as well.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.528
Thank you, julio.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.129
Hobbs:
It all sounds incriminating,

22:12.131 --> 22:14.031
but without
detective Sykes' witness,

22:14.033 --> 22:15.966
big hazard
can't be arrested.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.668
This problem is solvable
right now.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.038
Detective, we have ways
to help vulnerable witnesses.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.673
She lives
with a family member

22:22.675 --> 22:24.608
who owns their house,
so it's not like

22:24.610 --> 22:26.444
packing up an apartment
in the middle of the night

22:26.446 --> 22:28.446
and finding them
some cheap place
to live in palmdale.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.281
We'd have to put their house
on the market --

22:30.283 --> 22:32.316
I'll go to the mayor,
get a special dispensation

22:32.318 --> 22:34.752
to start the process,
expedite the sale.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.820
Which could take weeks.

22:35.822 --> 22:36.887
Look,
we know what happened.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.189
We have
an anonymous tip

22:38.191 --> 22:40.658
that lets us
at least question big hazard.

22:42.095 --> 22:45.496
Sharon: Still,
we can't unfind the gun, Amy,

22:45.498 --> 22:47.465
or the information
it gave us.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.533
And I'm extremely uncomfortable
leaving a murderer free

22:49.535 --> 22:51.369
while you guys figure out
an alternative route

22:51.371 --> 22:53.337
to the clear path
we're already on.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.506
If big hazard kills again,
detective,

22:55.508 --> 22:56.907
that would be squarely
on you.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.142
And if my witness
gets killed,

22:58.144 --> 22:59.677
that's squarely on me, too,
right?

23:03.216 --> 23:05.449
Look, in addition
to arresting murderers,

23:05.451 --> 23:08.185
the police are supposed to
protect the innocent.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.454
Now, I saw helpless kids
thrown into the line of fire,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.656
but that was in Afghanistan,
in a war zone.

23:12.658 --> 23:15.059
It should not be happening
here in America.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.460
The law allows Amy

23:16.462 --> 23:19.029
to keep her witness unidentified
for safety purposes.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.532
But at a preliminary hearing,
I can compel her to testify --

23:21.534 --> 23:23.334
provenza:
The prints on the gun

23:23.336 --> 23:25.936
help us get twizz
for the taco truck murder.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.538
Not enough to convict.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.940
Sharon:
But if we can make deals
for both of the murders,

23:29.942 --> 23:32.877
our eyewitness problem
goes away.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.645
Okay.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.746
Amy.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.783
I'll allow you
some latitude here,

23:38.785 --> 23:43.354
based on past competence
and your captain's judgment.

23:43.356 --> 23:47.658

where the justice system begins.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.893

for what happens.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.533
Yeah.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.201
We'll see.

Well, you may end up
identifying Alice,

39:42.714 --> 39:45.448
and she will have to change
her approach to the whole case.

39:45.450 --> 39:48.551
She will still
get a conviction.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.886
Good. Good.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.187
[ Inhales deeply ]

39:51.189 --> 39:53.056
Uh...
Have you eaten yet?

39:53.058 --> 39:54.591
Do -- do you want me
to wait for you?

39:54.593 --> 39:56.493
What a good idea.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.660
Um...

39:57.662 --> 39:58.828
I won't be long.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.330
Wa-- uh, Sharon.

40:01.400 --> 40:05.068
I want to be sure
you know, um...

40:05.070 --> 40:07.337
I know I-I don't
show it a lot, but --

40:07.339 --> 40:09.272
but you're way more important
to me

40:09.274 --> 40:12.208
than any story
I'll ever tell.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.244
Even about Alice.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.312
[ Sighs ]
Thank you.

40:17.282 --> 40:18.448
I am so proud, though,

40:18.450 --> 40:19.883
that you want
to speak up for her

40:19.885 --> 40:22.619
and that you were worried enough
about hurting her case

40:22.621 --> 40:25.355
that you brought us
those messages.

40:25.357 --> 40:29.392
Yeah, that -- that was
never really an issue.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.294
I'll just wait here
for you.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.462
Okay.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.201
[ Clears throat ]

40:38.203 --> 40:40.637
Uh, here's a list
of twizz's known associates,

40:40.639 --> 40:41.738
if we still need them.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.239
Oh, well, we may.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.575
Once he's locked up
and he trusts that he's safe,

40:45.577 --> 40:46.810
he may want to trade

40:46.812 --> 40:49.379
some of his fellow monsters
for luxury items.

40:49.381 --> 40:51.414
Yeah. Like, uh,
eggs and hamburgers.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.582
[ Chuckles ]

40:52.584 --> 40:55.351
Uh, listen, you know,
since it's calmed down here,

40:55.353 --> 40:58.455
uh, what do you say
to dinner tomorrow?

40:58.457 --> 41:00.156
At serve.

41:00.158 --> 41:04.060
It's new, it's, uh, nearby,
and people say, uh...

41:04.062 --> 41:05.462
Well, people say

41:05.464 --> 41:08.131
it's one of the most romantic
places in Los Angeles.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.533
R-romantic?

41:10.535 --> 41:12.469
Well, that's --
that's how it's described.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.503
Oh, I see.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.738
Uh, um...

41:15.740 --> 41:16.873
Uh...

41:16.875 --> 41:18.308
Fine.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.744
Uh...

41:21.746 --> 41:23.346
Where's hobbs?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.515
She's in interview 1,
I think.
