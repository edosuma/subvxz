WEBVTT

00:24.774 --> 00:26.860
-Sister Agnes, God rest her soul,

00:26.943 --> 00:28.820
wanted to throw it in the trash,

00:28.903 --> 00:29.946
but I intervened.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.449
Where most people would see
a smoking piece of junk,

00:32.532 --> 00:34.451
I saw a machine that needed understanding.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.745
So I scavenged a new heating element,

00:36.828 --> 00:39.330
and I repaired that little brave toaster
with my own two hands.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.792
Establishing a bond.
Just like with Will, right?

00:42.876 --> 00:43.918
Right.

00:44.002 --> 00:48.590
That toaster was just the beginning of
a long line of machines that I've saved.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.719
You see, I'm not just a mechanic.
I'm a machine whisperer.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.263
We wanted a robot. We got one.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.222
Yeah.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.269
If Scarecrow wanted to hurt us,
he could have on the Jupiter.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.562
He could do it now.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.790
Are you telling us…
there's an engine on that ship?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
So the coast is clear? No robots?

01:33.676 --> 01:34.719
Not clear.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.227
I count 12.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.369
They're gathering their dead.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.914
You mean salvaging parts.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.500
Hey.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.544
What's he doing?

02:11.131 --> 02:14.801
Okay, you brought us to an engine.
You got a plan how we get it?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.142
Twelve rocks. Twelve robots.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.936
-Those are long odds.
-You can take 'em, right?

02:30.608 --> 02:33.153
You want us to handle ten,
and you take two?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.698
Clearly a misunderstanding.
Maybe they don't count rocks like we do.

02:36.781 --> 02:37.907
That's a bad deal.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.997
Seems like it's the only deal we've got.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.624
You bring in a new guy,
everything changes.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.434
-He all right?

03:04.517 --> 03:05.727
Yeah, he's stable.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.187
You okay?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.479
Yeah. You?

03:09.647 --> 03:10.607
Yeah.

03:18.281 --> 03:22.410
Here's to diving off a two-mile high
canyon wall on an alien planet.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.246
And to being the first people ever
to make that toast.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.583
It would've scared the hell
out of most people.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.381
When we were in freefall,
I had this adrenaline pumping,

03:35.465 --> 03:39.719
and… I felt the landscape
rush toward me so fast.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.098
All I could think about was that…
nothing else mattered.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.518
Nothing that… that I've been
worrying about means anything.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.729
That's why I love flying.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.648
When you're miles in the air,

03:51.731 --> 03:54.067
you get a new perspective
on things on the ground,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.527
and all your problems look real small.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.451
Judy!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.213
You ready for this?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.839
Yeah.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.223
-I'm so happy you're back.
-Me too.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.228
This is my sister, Penny.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.813
Penny, this is…

04:32.397 --> 04:33.564
is… um…

04:34.649 --> 04:37.235
Commander Grant Kelly. I know.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.949
-It's really good to meet you.
-You too.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.036
Liam Tufeld.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.498
-Vijay Dhar. I'm even more honored, sir.
-Well, the honor is mine.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.959
You can meet the rest of my crew
while we load them up.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.210
-Okay.
-Great.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.019
That's crazy.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.770
I know.
It's crazy we ran into him.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.817
Everyone, this is Grant Kelly,

05:17.900 --> 05:19.277
captain of the Fortuna.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.989
He and his team are gonna
hitch a ride with us to Alpha Centauri,

05:23.072 --> 05:25.450
so I suppose they're part of our crew now.

05:27.076 --> 05:31.372
Um, we have 19 hours
until our launch window closes,

05:31.456 --> 05:34.667
-so… tell me about your progress.
-Oh, my gosh!

05:34.751 --> 05:37.503
-Okay with these jump seat configurations?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.421
Yes.

05:41.924 --> 05:42.842
Hello.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.805
He's just trying to decide
if you're a threat.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.308
-It's kind of his thing.
-Yeah.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.893
Judy told me about him.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.980
He's a whole lot stranger than I imagined.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.984
Dr. Zoe Smith.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.904
It's so nice to have another adult here.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.365
Judy mentioned you too.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.659
Hmm. Was it a brief mention,
or did she go into detail?

06:08.743 --> 06:10.870
-She said you were the French teacher.
-Mmm.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.872
Where did you learn French?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.249
France.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.921
Easy on your wrist, man.
You gotta respect the healing process.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.006
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.093
Any alternate power sources? I'd love
to give these backup cells a break.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.136
Sure. We can patch them into the Jupiter.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.221
All right, thank you.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.473
Come on. Let's take one.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.268
Okay, let's go forward.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.686
-Ready.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.107
Hey, Judy,
what do we do with the empty one?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.901
Just put it with the rest of them.
We'll need it later.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.866
Hey. What's the update with the thruster?

06:48.950 --> 06:52.203
Will fixed it. I'm just running
diagnostics while he's gone.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.329
Gone? Where?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.915
Documenting the alien city.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.878
Sorry. Did you just say "alien city"?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.216
Yeah, so, um… a lot has happened
while you were gone.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.636
This is Will Robinson
of the 24th Colonist Group.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.013
I'm making a record of this because…

07:11.639 --> 07:15.017
we've discovered the most important
archaeological site in history,

07:15.852 --> 07:18.229
and I've only got 19 hours
before we leave.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.277
This chamber appears
to be heavily damaged,

07:24.777 --> 07:26.821
not from the passage of time, but from…

07:27.947 --> 07:29.532
from some cataclysmic event.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.456
Wow.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.916
Pyroclastic ash.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.504
This room took the brunt
of a volcanic event.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.844
I'll get a sample.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.988
Oh, God!

08:16.996 --> 08:17.997
Okay…

08:20.124 --> 08:21.000
I…

08:22.126 --> 08:23.920
I've found skeletal remains.

08:36.974 --> 08:37.975
Whoa.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.609
They built the robots in their own image.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.656
I guess wanting to see yourself
in what you make is human nature,

08:53.282 --> 08:54.784
even if you're not human.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.417
It's counterintuitive,

09:03.501 --> 09:07.713
but you're gonna have to disable the BTMS
to moderate acceleration at high speeds.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.299
You've already done it.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.134
I swear I've never jury-rigged a Chariot

09:12.218 --> 09:14.220
to go over 100 miles an hour
in a drag race.

09:15.096 --> 09:19.183
Okay, look, once you're out there,
you need to manually add the coolant

09:19.267 --> 09:20.893
to keep the battery below 40 Celsius.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.187
-51, but who's counting?
-Or the plate temperature

09:23.271 --> 09:24.814
will reach thermal runaway.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.276
I will bring
every can of coolant we have. Yeah.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.988
As soon as Scarecrow has the engine,
you'll signal us, right?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.116
Yeah, and I'll pick you up in the Jupiter

09:35.199 --> 09:36.784
as soon as the coast is clear.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.163
It's a decent plan, all things considered.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.376
I just don't like leaving you alone
with that thing.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.545
Well, then I'll go with Don

09:47.628 --> 09:50.089
and lead ten angry robots
on a wild-goose chase.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.967
You can't have it both ways.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.305
-Hey, Scarecrow's not the obstacle.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.472
He's the solution.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.891
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
he isn't helping us

10:00.975 --> 10:02.560
just to be a Good Samaritan.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.646
Of course he's not.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.190
He's in it for himself. We all are.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.778
Scarecrow wants something from us,
and in return, we get something from him.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.325
That's how the world works,
no matter what planet you're from.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.788
Oww!

10:23.873 --> 10:25.374
Where is Scarecrow?

10:25.458 --> 10:29.128
Shouldn't he be here to say, "Danger!"
when stuff's about to fall on my head?

10:29.211 --> 10:30.588
It's not Will's robot.

10:41.265 --> 10:45.061
So are spaceships like bikes now?
Every kid on the block has one?

10:45.144 --> 10:46.187
Mmm…

10:46.270 --> 10:48.981
Nope, not yet.
I'm the only one here trained to fly it.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.110
Reaction control,
orbital maneuvering, roll, pitch, yaw.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.279
Jupiter, Fortuna.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.531
Different accent, same language.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.992
Maybe when we get to the colony,
they'll give you one.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.119
I'm looking forward
to seeing you in action.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.914
Oh, well, don't expect
too much action during launch.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.291
It's complicated.
The computer does everything.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.459
The computer?

11:08.542 --> 11:11.003
Yeah, you know,
spaceships have them these days.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.713
I haven't been asleep that long.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.175
I'm just curious
how automated things have gotten.

11:16.717 --> 11:20.054
Eh, fully, especially for
unusual conditions like asteroid fields.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.807
The computer calculates
every possible outcome

11:22.890 --> 11:24.517
and determines the safest course.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.771
The question is,
who programs the computer?

11:29.355 --> 11:33.150
You know, Mom was on the team
that programmed the Jupiter's autopilot.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.110
Maureen?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.153
That's right.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.448
Your mother could always out-think
a problem before it happened.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.244
But even the best computers
have limitations.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.707
They can handle 99% of the problems
until they hit the one they can't.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.501
Hi.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.254
Sorry. Do you want a progress report?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.214
Yeah.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.930
Are you qualified for this?

12:03.639 --> 12:05.808
I thought Judy was the doctor around here.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.644
-She's busy with captain stuff.
-Ah.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.856
But taking vitals is really easy.
The machine pretty much does the work.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.361
Why am I the only person
getting a physical?

12:18.946 --> 12:21.407
You're not. We're just starting with you.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.701
But we'll get to everyone
before we take off.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.663
To make sure
we're all healthy for the voyage.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.290
Exactly.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.918
And to make sure there's enough air
for everyone to breathe.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.465
Um…

12:37.548 --> 12:39.341
Take your arm, please.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.802
Thanks.

12:45.681 --> 12:49.435
Do you think having all one's vital organs
frozen in suspended animation

12:49.518 --> 12:51.061
carries any health risks?

12:53.689 --> 12:56.233
-What?
-You wanna put me in that tube, don't you?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.238
Um…

13:01.322 --> 13:03.657
I'm just trying
to take your blood pressure.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.243
It's rising by the minute.

13:21.717 --> 13:26.847
And there is a bridge
that drops into infinity.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.475
Huh. Great.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.644
Just great.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.675
What happened to them?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.796
It looks like some kind of… control panel.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.177
Wait, are those… handprints?

14:51.515 --> 14:52.516
Here goes.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.585
I'm… really sorry about this.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.915
Hey, what's wrong?

15:58.582 --> 16:00.042
Scarecrow was in here.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.340
Hey, was this up before?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.093
Maybe. I don't know.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.637
The navigation computers
run a periodic scan

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
even when the radar's offline.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.557
It's the location of the Sunshine base.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.060
What if he was spying?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.447
John, look.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.706
It's Ben Adler's personnel file.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.710
Maybe he was remembering.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.713
Maybe.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.967
What if they weren't good memories?

17:26.211 --> 17:29.381
It's a variation on the sound
the robot's spaceship transmitted,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.508
and a lot louder.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.219
We always thought that the…

17:34.303 --> 17:37.931
that the sounds we heard
were just… feedback or interference,

17:38.015 --> 17:41.351
the way their technology
interacted with ours.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.438
But maybe they were more than that.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.200
I think they might all be different.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.800
I don't suppose one of these
is the volume control.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.852
The camp's all packed,
ahead of schedule, thank you very much.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.647
Great. No reason to wait
till last minute. Let's go now.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.065
Judy to Will Robinson.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.070
-Will, do you copy?

18:38.492 --> 18:39.576
Will?

18:40.536 --> 18:41.703
Um…

18:41.787 --> 18:44.790
I should go get him.
Can you show me where it is on the map?

18:44.873 --> 18:45.791
Um…

18:46.875 --> 18:48.836
Will was in charge of the map.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.463
I'm done with my physical.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.216
I know the way. I could take you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.344
Um…

19:04.768 --> 19:05.686
All right.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.629
-You ready?
-Yeah.

19:33.589 --> 19:37.551
What about Scarecrow? How do we know
that once he's on the alien ship,

19:37.634 --> 19:39.720
he won't just fly off and leave us?

19:39.803 --> 19:40.971
I don't think he will.

19:41.763 --> 19:42.681
Why not?

19:44.391 --> 19:45.767
Will said to trust him.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.645
He said to help each other.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.939
That's different from trust.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.777
Which means we need to protect ourselves.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.160
That is why you brought this
from the Resolute, right?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.412
Take it.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.290
-I don't want it.

20:08.832 --> 20:09.750
Please?

20:11.001 --> 20:11.960
Just in case.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.678
Good luck.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.432
You too.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.567
He's not like that at all.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.070
-He's completely like that.
-Liam is not a show-off!

20:38.153 --> 20:39.988
During the climb, he would not shut up

20:40.072 --> 20:42.866
about some cliff in Thailand
that he used to climb every year.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.118
Was this before or after
you broke your wrist?

20:45.202 --> 20:48.121
-Okay, it's not, like, <i>that </i>broken.
-Mmm.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.709
-And I slipped because he distracted me.
-He helped you back to camp.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
That's exactly what show-offs do.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.047
You're unbelievable.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.675
Actually, what's unbelievable
is how loud Liam snores.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.134
Yeah, but everybody snores.

21:01.218 --> 21:05.305
-I mean, Judy snores, my dad snores…
-Yeah, I guess my dad snores too.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.644
I've completely lost track
of what point you're making.

21:13.897 --> 21:17.109
When you talked to your mom and dad,
did they mention my parents?

21:21.989 --> 21:25.075
Um… We didn't really have
a lot of time to talk.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.040
You know, the last year, I've just--

21:32.541 --> 21:34.876
I've been pretending
that we're at summer camp.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.296
You know?

21:38.005 --> 21:40.382
'Cause it's too hard to think
that maybe they didn't…

21:41.383 --> 21:42.509
they didn't make it.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.386
Hey.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.182
I'm sure your parents are fine.

21:49.975 --> 21:50.809
Okay?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.982
Oh, crap.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.943
-What do we do?
-Huh…

22:00.652 --> 22:01.737
Delegate.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.530
I can't get ahold of Judy or Will,

22:03.613 --> 22:05.824
and even if I could,
they can't get here in time.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.327
The computer wants us to launch now,
or it'll be too late.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.078
Just calm down.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.998
We're going to talk through this, okay?

22:13.081 --> 22:15.334
-Okay.
-All right.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.336
What's changed?

22:17.419 --> 22:20.505
Our previous calculations
were based on a narrow set of data.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.299
It was the best we could get
in this canyon.

22:22.382 --> 22:25.093
But after Judy found you,
she left her receiver behind.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.429
Up there, its antenna
can see the whole sky.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.556
There are more asteroids than we thought.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.641
They keep crashing
and making baby asteroids.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.560
If we don't launch now,
it'll be so dangerous

22:33.643 --> 22:35.687
the autopilot won't let us
turn on the engines.

22:36.938 --> 22:40.067
-The computer can ground the ship?
-If it thinks we're doing something crazy.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.446
It's not like I'd leave them,

22:44.529 --> 22:46.865
but I don't wanna strand
everybody else either.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.659
That's not a decision
you should have to make.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.411
Well, I'm acting cocaptain.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.749
What are you doing?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.629
<i>Warning, disabling autopilot.</i>

23:00.712 --> 23:02.255
-It's done.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.215
What?

23:04.132 --> 23:06.385
We can't launch the Jupiter
without autopilot.

23:07.928 --> 23:08.887
Sure we can.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.184
It's this way.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.771
Will?

23:19.689 --> 23:20.607
Will?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.568
I have a confession to make.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.195
You don't really know French?

23:27.072 --> 23:28.782
I can fly the Jupiter.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.619
Since when? What's the ADI?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.624
It's the attitude director indicator.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.503
It provides a continuous readout
of the ship's rotational rates.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.089
You know, roll, pitch, and yaw.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.344
I could step in
if something were to happen to you.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.763
This is about the cryotube, right?

23:53.723 --> 23:57.352
Next time, don't send Vijay Dhar to do
your dirty work. He's terrible at it.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.521
We don't have enough air left
on the Jupiter.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.899
The only reason your presence on the ship
didn't suffocate us all before

24:02.983 --> 24:04.568
is because you were the margin of error.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.610
It's used up.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.822
We don't have enough air in the Jupiter
because of Grant Kelly.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.491
He should go in the tube.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.244
It's his tube.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.204
He's a decorated astronaut.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.999
His decorations are 20 years old.

24:20.167 --> 24:24.546
I'm not saying I'm perfect,
but I'm the devil you know.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.590
What do you really know about Grant Kelly?

24:26.673 --> 24:28.425
I know everything that matters.

24:35.140 --> 24:39.269
I'm not going to willingly climb
into a prison I can't escape from.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.649
How do I know you won't shove me
into the police station at Alpha Centauri?

24:44.733 --> 24:47.110
-We'll let you out the minute we're there.
-I can't trust you.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.613
-You have my word.
-No, you don't understand. I--

24:50.113 --> 24:51.364
I can't trust you…

24:52.657 --> 24:54.743
because I can't trust anyone.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.662
Hmm.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.083
Why would I ever get into a cryotube

25:02.167 --> 25:05.795
when there's-- there's no one in the world
who would wanna wake me up?

25:09.466 --> 25:12.219
I've-- I've done things I regret.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.095
I've done bad things, but…

25:15.680 --> 25:20.602
the only thing that's worse
than being bad is being powerless.

25:22.062 --> 25:25.440
I can't give up control
without some kind of guarantee,

25:25.524 --> 25:29.361
so you're gonna have to give me
something stronger than your word.

25:31.821 --> 25:32.906
It's all I have.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.701
I appreciate your honesty.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.499
You hear that?

25:45.752 --> 25:46.795
It must be Will.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.798
-Will?

26:16.408 --> 26:19.160
Trust Will Robinson.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.965
Almost done.
Just a few more left to record.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.809
Come on, come on!

27:03.246 --> 27:04.372
-Will!

27:05.707 --> 27:08.335
-Will, get out of there!
-What do you think I'm doing?

27:08.418 --> 27:11.379
-No! The door's closing!

27:12.505 --> 27:14.049
-I can't stop it!

27:16.885 --> 27:18.637
-Will!

27:22.641 --> 27:23.683
-Wait.
-Will!

27:26.978 --> 27:28.730
-Are you okay?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.440
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.777
-Huh.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.826
-It's a good thing you had that with you.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.963
-I can see you're getting tired.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.466
-Let's just take five.
-Yeah.

27:57.384 --> 28:01.054
These things,
they look so light.

28:01.554 --> 28:02.972
-Phew.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.100
-Phew.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.981
-Hey, are you the jealous type?
-Nope.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.903
What if the other guy is… much bigger,

28:17.570 --> 28:18.988
has a body that won't quit,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.282
four arms with lots of fingers?

28:23.868 --> 28:24.994
Aah.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.752
Seriously, do you think Maureen's okay
with the new guy?

28:37.173 --> 28:39.509
She knows what she has to do
if things go bad.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.255
What are you gonna do when this is over?

29:19.048 --> 29:22.677
You have a place to go to
after you take us to Alpha Centauri?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.273
Are you looking for a new home,

29:36.149 --> 29:37.108
like we are?

29:38.818 --> 29:41.029
Or are you just gonna keep going,

29:41.613 --> 29:42.864
see what's out there?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.752
What we did to you is wrong.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.674
I can't pretend to imagine

30:02.634 --> 30:05.470
the suffering you went through
on the Resolute.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.479
What happened to you there
will never happen again.

30:16.731 --> 30:19.609
If we're gonna work together,
we need to trust each other,

30:19.692 --> 30:23.613
and I-- I haven't been
worthy of your trust.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.285
I wanna give you this.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.884
Did you do this?

30:55.311 --> 30:57.856
All right, everybody.
Pay attention, please.

30:58.523 --> 31:02.026
Please double-check
that everything is tied down.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.361
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,

31:03.444 --> 31:05.989
and I don't want anybody taking
a loose box to the teeth.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.409
Judy, thank God you're back.
You need to talk to Grant.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
Okay. Well, where is he?

31:14.914 --> 31:17.959
Hey, uh… I know it was hard for you, but…

31:18.042 --> 31:20.420
you did the right thing
staying with the ship.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.802
And I think I found something
that can help us later.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.063
If our positions were reversed,
you'd have made the same call.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.483
-A captain doesn't leave people behind.
-These kids are my responsibility.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.444
My mission was to get them
to Alpha Centauri.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.654
-Now we can't leave.
-Your mission hasn't failed.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.033
-The computer doesn't--
-It nearly stranded you in space.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.368
That is what happened, isn't it?

31:52.452 --> 31:54.245
You came looking for me on the Fortuna,

31:54.329 --> 31:56.414
and the autopilot tried
to leave you behind.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.833
We had limited options.
We lost a thruster.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.669
Thanks to your brother,
all the thrusters are working now.

32:02.378 --> 32:05.214
-I can fly this ship off the planet.
-Manually?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.430
You put too much faith in computers.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.768
The Fortuna's computer kept me on ice.
because it thought it was keeping me safe.

32:16.851 --> 32:18.019
I had no choice.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.981
If it were up to me,
I would have woken up a long time ago

32:22.065 --> 32:25.068
and turned off the damn signal
that drew you all off course.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.488
And none of you kids would be here.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.035
I was not picked for my mission
because I'm a good sleeper.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.538
I can fly us through that asteroid field.

32:39.165 --> 32:39.999
I don't know.

32:42.752 --> 32:43.586
You do know.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.809
-What are you doing?
-Uh--

32:59.352 --> 33:01.729
You almost lost your arm
because of this camera.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.023
It must be important.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.025
-Well, can I have it back?
-Of course.

33:06.109 --> 33:09.153
It'll be tucked safe
inside the cryotube with me.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.864
Once we get to Alpha Centauri,

33:11.948 --> 33:14.659
you'll just pop open the hatch
and get it back.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.328
This is my insurance policy.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.456
No.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.002
I'm your insurance policy.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.545
Excuse me?

33:26.921 --> 33:30.341
After we all get to the colony,
the robot and I have something to do.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.385
Something my family won't like.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.178
I promise I won't get in your way.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.223
I need you to get in theirs.
Distract them while we sneak off.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.100
It's something you're good at.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.854
In order for you to do that, I have
to let you out of the tube. So, deal?

33:45.898 --> 33:48.192
Finally, I've had some influence on you.

33:50.820 --> 33:54.532
You and the robot are going to do
something foolish and heroic, aren't you?

33:57.910 --> 33:59.120
Not foolish.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.666
Okay. You're gonna feel a slight tingle

34:03.750 --> 34:06.085
followed by a warm flush
through your body.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.464
All right.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.344
-Just count backwards from a hundred.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.607
<i>Cryo-sequence initiated.</i>

34:27.690 --> 34:29.442
<i>Vital signs stable.</i>

34:34.363 --> 34:37.784
-She looks peaceful.
-Mm. She should be unconscious more often.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.834
A little late to bring this up,

34:46.918 --> 34:50.296
but why'd you have to fix
the Jupiter's engine if we've got that?

34:50.797 --> 34:54.425
It seems like we'd be on Alpha Centauri
in time for dinner if you switched it on.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.676
Danger.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.347
That machine rips open a hole
in the fabric of space.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.974
We have to be in orbit to use it safely.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.645
Well, by the sounds of it, getting
into orbit is gonna be dangerous too.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.817
<i>Launch commences</i>
<i>in T-minus ten, nine…</i>

35:10.900 --> 35:12.443
-Seals, check.
-Eight, seven…

35:12.527 --> 35:13.986
-Internal power, check.
-…six…

35:14.070 --> 35:16.072
-Fuel prepress, check.
-…five, four…

35:16.155 --> 35:19.033
-All systems go.
-…three, two, one.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.409
-Liftoff.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.581
Exterior obstacles detected.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.125
-I see them.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.157
Okay, hang on. We're almost out.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.660
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Flight path compromised.</i>

36:45.661 --> 36:48.247
The computer recommends
we pitch 13 degrees at nine o'clock.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.506
-I don't think so.
-It says it's the safest way to go.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.884
I'm not flying the ship
directly into an asteroid

36:59.967 --> 37:01.427
to avoid a bunch of asteroids.

37:01.510 --> 37:05.139
I think you should listen to the computer
and pitch 13 degrees at nine o'clock.

37:11.270 --> 37:14.273
-Commander, proceed to recommended course.
-The computer's wrong.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.817
Proceed to recommended course
or stand down.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.629
-Judy.
-<i>Autopilot rebooting.</i>

37:37.797 --> 37:39.548
Unplug that.
You don't know what you're doing.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.551
-<i>Autopilot online.</i>
-Maybe not, but my mom does.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.553
<i>Correcting course.</i>

37:54.397 --> 37:55.982
<i>Course corrected.</i>

37:56.649 --> 37:57.566
Are you sure?

37:58.067 --> 37:59.151
It's too late now.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.490
-Judy.
-Trust me.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.129
Chair's yours, Captain.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.298
You don't have to call me that.

39:03.758 --> 39:04.717
Yes, I do.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.387
Maureen's autopilot worked.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.891
That's why she was top of our class.

39:12.475 --> 39:16.354
What class? Didn't you meet her
when she was an engineer at NASA?

39:16.437 --> 39:17.396
No.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.358
We were in the astronaut training program.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.903
Mom was gonna be an astronaut?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.155
-Okay.
-All set?

40:10.491 --> 40:11.492
All set.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.703
Get ready to burn, baby, burn.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.834
Here we go.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.716
-Do they see us?
-Oh, they sure do.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.887
-All right, then.
-Rock and roll.

40:44.191 --> 40:46.360
Okay, that's ten. You're up.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.874
You want your eggs sunny-side up
or over-easy?

41:20.019 --> 41:22.646
Felt that.
It's already hot enough back here.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.066
Hang on.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.326
What is taking you so long?

41:35.826 --> 41:37.578
What are you doing in there?

42:04.897 --> 42:08.526
That's the last of the coolant.
We'll be slowing down pretty quickly.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.862
-Any sign of the flare?
-Nothing yet.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.657
What's taking her so long?

42:44.937 --> 42:46.105
Nice job!

42:50.901 --> 42:53.487
We're losing speed,
and they're not getting any closer.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.322
That's good news, right?

42:58.742 --> 43:00.244
-Oof!

43:01.537 --> 43:03.998
What the hell?

43:04.081 --> 43:06.083
-Take a look.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.049
-Why'd they stop?

43:14.133 --> 43:15.801
We weren't distracting them.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.803
They were distracting us.

43:17.886 --> 43:19.013
-What?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.473
It's a trap!

44:13.567 --> 44:15.778
Find home.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.406
-What happened?
-Where's Scarecrow?

45:03.242 --> 45:04.326
SAR took him.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.078
-SAR?

45:07.538 --> 45:08.914
The engine was bait.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.333
Ugh.

45:15.045 --> 45:17.005
Scarecrow wasn't gonna betray us.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.800
He was gonna take us home.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.723
And he was our last hope.
