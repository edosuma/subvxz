00:00.299 --> 00:03.132
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.613 --> 00:07.114
Man: We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.182 --> 00:09.550
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.618 --> 00:12.214
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.281 --> 00:14.622
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.690 --> 00:16.625
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.693 --> 00:19.861
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.929 --> 00:22.494
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.562 --> 00:24.095
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.163 --> 00:25.727
Should we shoot them?

00:25.794 --> 00:28.297
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.364 --> 00:30.696
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.233
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.301 --> 00:35.404
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.472 --> 00:37.909
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.976 --> 00:39.582
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.990 --> 00:50.095
<i>In any investigation,</i>
<i>leads go cold fast.</i>

00:50.163 --> 00:53.232
<i>It's true for cops</i>
<i>and even truer for spies,</i>

00:53.300 --> 00:56.368
<i>who tend to be after a more</i>
<i>sophisticated class of bad guy.</i>

00:56.436 --> 00:59.170
<i>So if you get intelligence</i>
<i>that the person you're chasing</i>

00:59.238 --> 01:01.706
<i>hired a bomb maker who lives</i>
<i>a few hours up the highway,</i>

01:01.774 --> 01:05.275
<i>you can't afford to sit</i>
<i>on the information.</i>

01:05.343 --> 01:08.712
<i>You have to move immediately.</i>

01:10.514 --> 01:11.747
Sam,
are you gonna help?

01:11.815 --> 01:13.182
Yeah, it's just that --

01:13.250 --> 01:15.620
I mean, you really think
this old guy built that bomb?

01:15.688 --> 01:19.058
I mean, he's owned a clock shop
for like 20 years.

01:19.126 --> 01:21.160
Under a different
last name.

01:21.228 --> 01:23.530
He's a war criminal,
and he's hiding.

01:23.597 --> 01:25.800
Fiona went to a lot of trouble
to get that file.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.802
If it says the bomb maker's
hiding out in Tallahassee,

01:27.870 --> 01:29.337
that's where we're going.

01:29.405 --> 01:31.074
Well, I just want to be sure
we're making the right move.

01:31.141 --> 01:32.342
It's the <i>only</i> move,
Sam.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.910
Fi, Sam and I
won't be able to get back

01:33.978 --> 01:35.712
until late
tomorrow night.

01:35.779 --> 01:38.481
Which means we're not having
that dinner at the Forge.

01:38.549 --> 01:40.349
Sorry.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.051
All right,
this is important.

01:42.118 --> 01:43.986
You want me to cancel
the reservation?

01:46.422 --> 01:48.189
There <i>is</i> no reservation.

01:48.257 --> 01:49.624
I'm sorry.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.059
This guy --

01:51.126 --> 01:52.960
Could help you find out
who killed Max -- I know.

01:53.028 --> 01:54.762
Take these.

01:55.831 --> 01:58.232
Be safe.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074

02:19.593 --> 02:21.594
Mmm.

02:21.662 --> 02:23.262
<i>Three</i> doughnuts, Sam?

02:23.330 --> 02:25.432
I got to eat junk
while Elsa's not around.

02:25.499 --> 02:27.101
Get too close,
you can sense it.

02:27.169 --> 02:29.270
I'll tell you what --
if we're after 11:00,

02:29.337 --> 02:31.405
I'm gonna get some cheese fries
from that diner over there.

02:34.977 --> 02:37.445
Oh, your cheese fries
might have to wait.

02:37.513 --> 02:38.513
I think this is our guy.

02:39.949 --> 02:42.050
All right, let's see
what he has to say.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.518
<i>Or</i> we wait
till he closes up

02:43.586 --> 02:45.587
and we tail him someplace
less populated.

02:45.654 --> 02:47.222
This has nothing to do
with cheese fries.

02:47.289 --> 02:48.623
This is just tactics.

02:48.691 --> 02:50.324
We're not gonna give that guy
a day to figure out

02:50.392 --> 02:52.260
that we're watching him.

02:52.327 --> 02:54.762
We're going in the front,
we're taking him out the back.

03:01.972 --> 03:05.341
Are you
the fella that fixes the clocks?

03:05.409 --> 03:07.510
Yes,
I buy, sell, and repair.

03:07.578 --> 03:10.046
Like the sign says --
I'm a clockmaker.

03:12.684 --> 03:16.020
A football buddy of ours,
well, his father passed away,

03:16.088 --> 03:18.956
left us his collection of,
uh, antique clocks.

03:19.024 --> 03:21.927
Yes, sir, and we were told
that Lucien Balan's

03:21.994 --> 03:23.528
the fella we should talk to
about selling them.

03:23.596 --> 03:25.397
They're outside in the car

03:25.465 --> 03:28.033
if you want to come out
and take a quick look.

03:28.101 --> 03:30.536
Spare me the trip.

03:30.604 --> 03:31.937
Please.

03:32.005 --> 03:33.672
Come in back.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.208
I'll show you my catalogs.
You show me what you have.

03:36.276 --> 03:39.312
Who told you about me?

03:39.379 --> 03:41.714
I like to know
who gives referrals.

03:41.782 --> 03:44.117
Martin McCauley
up in Greenville --

03:44.185 --> 03:45.619
he sung your praises.

03:46.721 --> 03:48.755
And this Martin --

03:48.823 --> 03:50.757
did he tell you
how he knows me?

03:50.825 --> 03:54.094
I don't hear the name
Lucien much.

03:54.161 --> 03:56.463
These days,
they call me Luka.

03:56.530 --> 03:59.332
<i>Only the smartest,</i>
<i>nastiest war criminals</i>

03:59.400 --> 04:00.633

<i>If you have to capture</i>
<i>one of them,</i>

04:02.303 --> 04:04.570
<i>you can assume they'll have</i>
<i>a trick up their sleeve,</i>

04:04.638 --> 04:06.439
<i>like a concealed weapon,</i>

04:06.507 --> 04:08.141
<i>a covert escape route,</i>

04:08.208 --> 04:09.909
<i>or a metal floor grate</i>

04:09.977 --> 04:12.278
<i>rigged to electrocute</i>
<i>any unwanted visitors.</i>

04:12.346 --> 04:14.447
Sam, move!

04:17.885 --> 04:19.053
Stay right there.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.288
We're gonna have
a little chat, Lucien.

04:24.927 --> 04:28.997
You'll be disappointed.
I don't talk.

04:29.065 --> 04:32.501
Don't worry. We're good
at getting people to open up.

04:48.127 --> 04:50.027
Sam: Now, we know
you built the bomb, Lucien,

04:50.095 --> 04:51.529
but you're not the guy
we're after.

04:51.597 --> 04:54.165
Just tell us who you built
the bomb for,

04:54.233 --> 04:57.269
and we can share these
delicious carrot sticks.

04:57.337 --> 04:59.805
<i>The real experts</i>
<i>in resisting interrogation</i>

04:59.873 --> 05:01.774
<i>aren't the ones who stonewall</i>
<i>in silence.</i>

05:01.841 --> 05:03.876
<i>They're the ones who have</i>
<i>mastered the art</i>

05:03.944 --> 05:06.312
<i>of talking about nothing,</i>

05:06.380 --> 05:10.184
<i>pretending to cooperate,</i>
<i>throwing out endless leads.</i>

05:10.251 --> 05:11.718
There was one man.

05:11.786 --> 05:15.689
Came to the shop
last Wednesday.

05:15.756 --> 05:18.124
<i>They use your need for</i>
<i>information against you...</i>

05:18.192 --> 05:21.494
Big man, like football man,
but small head.

05:21.562 --> 05:23.463
He pays with money order.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.432
<i>...Giving you things</i>
<i>you want to believe.</i>

05:26.500 --> 05:30.068
There was also other man --
bald...

05:32.338 --> 05:33.505
...ring in his nose.

05:33.573 --> 05:35.173
Strange, right?

05:36.276 --> 05:38.144
Lucien, yesterday,

05:38.212 --> 05:40.246
you told us about a guy
who paid with a check.

05:40.314 --> 05:41.915
Thin, like a little girl.

05:41.983 --> 05:43.583
The day before that,

05:43.651 --> 05:45.685
it was a fat guy
with a lisp.

05:45.753 --> 05:48.388
<i>All they're doing</i>
<i>is running out the clock.</i>

05:48.456 --> 05:51.759
<i>You're not going to break them</i>
<i>with more conversation --</i>

05:51.827 --> 05:53.428
<i>you need an edge.</i>

05:58.634 --> 05:59.967
You know
what kind of girlfriend

06:00.035 --> 06:01.335
drives all the way
to Tallahassee

06:01.403 --> 06:04.305
to search a crusty old man's
equally crusty apartment?

06:04.373 --> 06:05.506
A <i>good</i> girlfriend.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.908
A <i>great</i> girlfriend.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.376
The kind of girlfriend who
deserves dinner at the Forge.

06:09.444 --> 06:12.413
Point taken.
How about <i>two</i> dinners?

06:12.480 --> 06:16.083
All his personal stuff
fits into <i>one</i> box?

06:16.151 --> 06:17.585
He's not
a big scrapbooker.

06:17.653 --> 06:18.953
Just a few photos,

06:19.020 --> 06:20.320
postcards, news clippings --
not much to go on.

06:20.388 --> 06:22.156
You're welcome.

06:22.224 --> 06:23.924
You want to
stick around, Fi?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.760
Oh, it's tempting,
but I got to run.

06:25.828 --> 06:27.295
I'm helping Jesse

06:27.363 --> 06:28.897
with one of his company's
home-security gigs.

06:28.964 --> 06:30.832
Have fun, you two.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.708
My husband thinks I'm crazy,

06:39.775 --> 06:41.609
and the police think
I'm paranoid,

06:41.677 --> 06:44.512
but I can't shake the feeling
someone's been in here.

06:44.580 --> 06:46.781
So, three nights this week,
and the alarms never went off?

06:46.848 --> 06:49.683
Not once.

06:49.751 --> 06:51.419
You guys don't believe me,
either.

06:51.486 --> 06:52.987
No, no, no.
That's not true.

06:53.055 --> 06:54.989
We're just trying to get our
heads around this, that's all.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.591
Do you have any enemies,

06:56.658 --> 06:59.427
anyone that you can think of
who would want to go after you?

06:59.495 --> 07:01.896
No. I don't think so.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.232
And you're sure
nothing was taken?

07:04.300 --> 07:06.501
Nothing was stolen --
just, um...

07:06.569 --> 07:07.669
Moved.

07:07.737 --> 07:09.037
I know I sound stupid.

07:09.105 --> 07:11.506
No, it isn't stupid
to trust your instincts.

07:11.574 --> 07:12.941
James: Maybe not,
but it's getting expensive.

07:13.008 --> 07:14.909
Sadie...

07:14.977 --> 07:18.546
I take it these are
the <i>new</i> security experts.

07:18.613 --> 07:21.482
Honey -- this is
Fiona and Jesse.

07:21.550 --> 07:22.884
Spare me
the sales pitch.

07:22.952 --> 07:25.386
I have already dropped 200 grand
on the new alarm system.

07:25.454 --> 07:27.589
Well, just because you have
all the equipment

07:27.657 --> 07:29.358
doesn't mean
you know how to use it.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.527
I think what
my associate means is...

07:31.595 --> 07:33.229
State-of-the-art security system
isn't really worth much

07:33.297 --> 07:36.332
if your motion sensors are being
blocked by furniture

07:36.400 --> 07:38.968
or trees are growing too close
to your house.

07:39.036 --> 07:40.036
Bottom line --
what are you proposing?

07:40.103 --> 07:41.537
We'll add some sensors,

07:41.605 --> 07:43.739
troubleshoot your
existing systems.

07:43.807 --> 07:45.975
Fiona: If it helps
you sleep easier,

07:46.043 --> 07:47.176
we can move you
into the guesthouse

07:47.244 --> 07:48.544
and we'll be here
around the clock.

07:48.612 --> 07:49.678
If anyone shows up,
we'll be ready.

07:49.746 --> 07:53.783
And if they don't...

07:53.850 --> 07:56.719
we can put all this
behind us...finally.

08:07.866 --> 08:10.302
<i>When you're looking for</i>
<i>an angle in an interrogation,</i>

08:10.369 --> 08:11.970
<i>it often helps to let a subject</i>

08:12.038 --> 08:14.740
<i>watch you go through</i>
<i>the details of his life</i>

08:14.807 --> 08:16.475
<i>right in front of him.</i>

08:16.542 --> 08:18.710
Other man visits the shop.

08:18.778 --> 08:21.446
Very blonde,

08:21.513 --> 08:24.681
like albino man.

08:24.749 --> 08:27.017
He pays with
a cashier's check.

08:27.085 --> 08:28.618
<i>Keeping one eye</i>
<i>on your research</i>

08:28.686 --> 08:31.254
<i>and one eye on his reactions</i>

08:31.322 --> 08:33.423
<i>can often tell you</i>
<i>what he wants you to see...</i>

08:36.193 --> 08:38.028
<i>...and what he doesn't.</i>

08:41.499 --> 08:42.700
Finally got the old guy
to blink.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.001
What did the trick?

08:44.068 --> 08:46.037
Some article about a charity 10k
up in Atlanta.

08:46.105 --> 08:47.672
Three years ago.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.840
So we found a relative?

08:48.908 --> 08:50.475
Hopefully a close one.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.478
- One of us should run down these names --
- Yeah, not it.

08:53.813 --> 08:55.714
You weren't
expecting that, were you?

08:55.781 --> 08:57.649
Fine, but the next errand
is yours.

09:06.391 --> 09:08.892
All right,
James and Sadie are sleeping,

09:08.960 --> 09:10.794
and the house is clear.

09:10.862 --> 09:13.130
Next time
you offer me a job

09:13.198 --> 09:15.733
protecting
an egomaniacal bastard,

09:15.800 --> 09:17.602
remind me to say no.

09:17.669 --> 09:19.303
Seriously?

09:19.371 --> 09:21.773
You're drinking sparkling water,
munching on biscotti,

09:21.841 --> 09:24.176
and playing solitaire, Fi --
I think you'll survive.

09:24.244 --> 09:25.811
Did you see the contempt
he had for his wife?

09:25.879 --> 09:28.114
We won't be inviting him to the
Carlito for brunch anytime soon,

09:28.182 --> 09:30.283
but I don't know -- the guy's
done some pretty amazing things.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.054
I-I was reading up
on him.

09:34.122 --> 09:37.224
He developed this antiviral.
It was groundbreaking.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.526
He got honorable mention
from the Nobel Foundation.

09:42.063 --> 09:44.265
Second floor,
northeast corner.

09:44.332 --> 09:45.599
That's James' office.

09:49.671 --> 09:51.037
Is that the alarm?

09:51.105 --> 09:53.406
Yeah, there's somebody
in the main house.

09:53.474 --> 09:55.175
Oh, my God.
I knew it. I knew it.

09:55.242 --> 09:56.743
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just call the cops.

09:56.811 --> 09:58.344
We'll be right back.

10:15.062 --> 10:16.963
Don't move!

10:17.030 --> 10:18.164
Put your hands up.

10:18.232 --> 10:20.367
I'm not armed.
Don't worry.

10:20.435 --> 10:22.135
Well, that's good to hear.
Now put your hands up.

10:22.203 --> 10:25.905
You want to shoot me?
Go ahead. Shoot me.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.307
I don't think you understand
how this works.

10:27.374 --> 10:29.176
You're the burglar,
we're protecting the house.

10:29.244 --> 10:30.511
I am not a burglar.

10:30.578 --> 10:31.678
Put your damn hands
on your head.

10:31.746 --> 10:33.113
We're going downstairs.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.948
I can't believe
that after all these years

10:35.016 --> 10:36.183
he wins, just like that.

10:36.251 --> 10:38.152
Wait. W-what are
you talking about?

10:38.219 --> 10:40.788
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about your boss.

10:40.855 --> 10:43.457
James -- he took
everything from me.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.325
Oh, what, did he forget
to mention his ex-partner?

10:45.393 --> 10:46.693
Best friend that he framed
and left to die

10:46.761 --> 10:49.296
in a rat-infested prison
in South America?

10:49.364 --> 10:51.732
Wait a minute.
You're Dan Tesmond?

10:51.799 --> 10:53.567
Did I miss something?

10:53.635 --> 10:54.935
HLX used to be
a two-man operation.

10:55.003 --> 10:56.370
It was James Forte
and Dan Tesmond.

10:56.438 --> 10:59.240
It took me seven years
to figure out how to escape.

10:59.308 --> 11:01.676
I scrounged together enough
money to pay off a prison doctor

11:01.744 --> 11:02.778
to fake my death.

11:02.845 --> 11:04.145
And that's just the fun part.

11:04.213 --> 11:05.614
I get back to Miami,

11:05.682 --> 11:07.616
and I found out that James
had stolen my company,

11:07.684 --> 11:10.787
my future...

11:10.854 --> 11:13.123
And my wife.

11:20.698 --> 11:22.527
- You were married to Sadie.
- Yeah.

11:22.528 --> 11:24.192
I'm sorry. You can tell
your story to the cops.

11:24.193 --> 11:25.438
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
We need to hear the rest of it.

11:25.439 --> 11:27.143
- Fi, we've done our job.
- But what if he's telling the truth?

11:27.144 --> 11:27.974
We're not getting involved.

11:27.977 --> 11:29.781
Jesse, if it's true,
he shouldn't be locked up again!

11:32.375 --> 11:33.608
All right, fine.

11:33.676 --> 11:35.177
You get him out of here,
I'll buy us some time.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.021
You're letting me go?

11:45.089 --> 11:46.256
I'm taking you somewhere
to hear you out.

11:46.323 --> 11:47.757
And if you're lying,

11:47.825 --> 11:50.427
I am going to push you out of an
even higher window head-first.

11:52.631 --> 11:54.632
Well? Anything?

11:56.969 --> 11:58.202
By the time
we got to your office,

11:58.270 --> 11:59.637
he had already jumped out
the window.

11:59.705 --> 12:02.306
Fi's sweeping the grounds,
but chances are he's long gone.

12:02.374 --> 12:05.576
Well, if he comes back,

12:05.643 --> 12:07.178
you sure as hell better
catch him.

12:19.876 --> 12:21.277
Uh-oh.

12:21.844 --> 12:24.880
Fiona let you live.
I take that as a good sign.

12:24.948 --> 12:26.882
I told you that everything
I said back there was true.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.283
Fiona:
And there's more.

12:28.351 --> 12:30.353
You know that antiviral
that James supposedly created?

12:30.420 --> 12:32.254
That was actually
Dan's creation.

12:32.322 --> 12:33.656
And that's why he set you up.

12:33.723 --> 12:35.024
Yeah. I wanted to go public
with it,

12:35.091 --> 12:36.858
help as many people
as possible.

12:36.926 --> 12:38.727
James could only
see dollar signs.

12:38.795 --> 12:40.195
He put five keys of cocaine
in my bag,

12:40.263 --> 12:42.897
and he paid off a judge
to make sure that it stuck.

12:42.965 --> 12:45.666
And then James patented
the gene sequence,

12:45.734 --> 12:47.668
turning HLX
into a gold mine.

12:47.736 --> 12:49.904
And Sadie left me
while I was in prison.

12:49.972 --> 12:52.674
So,
I've had better vacations.

12:52.741 --> 12:55.777
Damn, you got
a raw deal, man.

12:55.845 --> 12:58.814
But why rob their house?

12:58.882 --> 13:00.750
I was just looking for anything
to get into HLX.

13:00.817 --> 13:02.685
If he can get
that gene sequence,

13:02.753 --> 13:04.487
he can finish
what he started.

13:04.555 --> 13:06.189
There are labs that will
duplicate the formula

13:06.257 --> 13:08.792
and sell it generically
for 1/10 the price,

13:08.860 --> 13:11.462
making it accessible to anyone
who needs it.

13:11.530 --> 13:13.464
So, you save the world while
driving James out of business.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.798
I got that.

13:14.866 --> 13:16.533
I don't see how
it's actually gonna happen.

13:16.601 --> 13:17.934
It's just a dream, man.
It's over.

13:18.002 --> 13:19.135
No, it's not.

13:19.203 --> 13:21.136
You need more reasons
to hate James?

13:21.204 --> 13:22.605
How about
rushed medical trials,

13:22.672 --> 13:23.872
victims silenced
with hush money,

13:23.940 --> 13:25.607
lawsuits against anyone
who speaks out?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.109
Yeah, and my gene sequence
made it all possible.

13:28.177 --> 13:30.211
James is too dirty.
He's too powerful.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.413
And that smile needs to be
slapped off his face.

13:32.481 --> 13:33.748
Jesse:
So, just to clarify,

13:33.816 --> 13:34.916
you want to rip off
my client?

13:34.984 --> 13:36.151
Well, no one else
is gonna do it.

13:36.218 --> 13:37.285
He can't get into HLX.

13:37.353 --> 13:38.954
Neither can we.
Fi, it's a fortress.

13:39.022 --> 13:40.956
And after last night, James is
only gonna increase his security.

13:41.024 --> 13:43.326
So if you think that somehow
you --

13:44.628 --> 13:46.996
oh.
Mm-hmm.

13:47.064 --> 13:49.065
Oh.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.501
What just happened?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.169
I believe we decided
to help you.

13:55.972 --> 13:56.805
Really?

14:02.478 --> 14:05.146
Ross is our head of security.

14:05.214 --> 14:06.780
You must be Jesse Porter.

14:06.848 --> 14:08.349
Thank you
for escorting them in.

14:08.416 --> 14:11.751
Well, you're -- you're actually
just the guy I need to talk to.

14:11.819 --> 14:13.954
I'm gonna need full security
access to the facility.

14:14.022 --> 14:15.489
Building schematics --

14:15.557 --> 14:18.192
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
that's against company policy.

14:18.260 --> 14:20.695
I see.

14:20.763 --> 14:23.765
Is it your company's policy
to endanger your C.E.O.'s life?

14:23.833 --> 14:25.200
James:
Don't worry, Mr. Porter.

14:25.268 --> 14:26.736
HLX Medical Technologies

14:26.803 --> 14:28.705
has billion-dollar
trade secrets,

14:28.773 --> 14:31.441
and we have hired a small army
to protect them.

14:31.509 --> 14:33.677
Yeah, I think we can hold
our own against some nutjob

14:33.745 --> 14:35.512
who breaks into houses.

14:35.580 --> 14:38.048
That nutjob
is studying you.

14:38.115 --> 14:39.749
He's trying to figure out
what makes you tick.

14:39.817 --> 14:42.419
That sort of obsession can
become deadly in a heartbeat.

14:42.487 --> 14:43.621
Sadie:
This is horrible.

14:43.689 --> 14:45.356
How can this be happening
to my husband?

14:45.424 --> 14:46.557
It's hard to say.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.992
A lot of times,
disturbed people --

14:48.060 --> 14:49.861
they -- they get fixated
on great men.

14:49.929 --> 14:51.129
Your husband's
a great man.

14:55.901 --> 14:57.235
We can't be too careful.

14:57.303 --> 14:59.304
You let me inspect your office,
the adjacent rooms,

14:59.371 --> 15:01.239
I'll accompany you
on your day-to-day routine.

15:01.307 --> 15:02.573
No. I'm fine here.

15:02.641 --> 15:05.543
Your job is to keep us safe
beyond those doors.

15:05.611 --> 15:07.479
I'll call you
when I'm leaving.

15:08.814 --> 15:10.748
There's a coffee house
down the street.

15:10.816 --> 15:12.817
Grab yourself a latte.

15:12.885 --> 15:14.852
Maybe you can keep
<i>that</i> place secure.

15:20.759 --> 15:24.429
<i>Like aikido masters,</i>

15:24.496 --> 15:26.030
<i>interrogators know that</i>
<i>breaking their adversary</i>

15:26.098 --> 15:27.498
<i>isn't just about leverage --</i>

15:27.566 --> 15:29.534
<i>it's about knowing how</i>
<i>and when to apply it.</i>

15:29.601 --> 15:32.937
<i>The moment your opponent</i>
<i>feels most confident...</i>

15:33.004 --> 15:34.438
Good morning, boys.

15:34.506 --> 15:36.807
<i>...Is also the moment</i>
<i>he's most susceptible</i>

15:36.875 --> 15:38.042
<i>to a game-changing reversal.</i>

15:38.110 --> 15:40.444
It <i>might</i> be.
It all depends on you.

15:40.512 --> 15:41.912
You ready to talk?

15:41.980 --> 15:43.314
Oh, yes, I am.

15:43.382 --> 15:45.283
Last night, I remember

15:45.350 --> 15:47.685
another suspicious man --

15:47.753 --> 15:50.521
customer from Tampa,
with a scar.

15:50.589 --> 15:53.324
And there's
a funny story about that man.

15:53.392 --> 15:55.492
Actually, we have a funny story
of our own.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.361
It's about a war criminal.

15:57.428 --> 15:59.329
And his daughter,
in Atlanta.

16:05.068 --> 16:07.836
My daughter.

16:07.904 --> 16:09.938
Yes.

16:10.006 --> 16:12.407
She visits me
from Romania.

16:12.475 --> 16:16.044
She placed third
in that race.

16:16.112 --> 16:17.279
I was <i>very</i> proud.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.414
I'm sure you were.

16:19.482 --> 16:20.749
But your daughter
is not a runner,

16:20.817 --> 16:22.251
and she doesn't live
in Romania.

16:22.319 --> 16:25.220
She wrote the article.
It was her first.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.923
And, uh, Danica doesn't like
the family name, either.

16:27.991 --> 16:29.791
She lives just outside
of Buckhead.

16:29.859 --> 16:30.926
For now.

16:30.994 --> 16:32.327
See, Lucien,

16:32.395 --> 16:35.030
we're gonna have her deported
unless you start talking.

16:35.098 --> 16:36.232
Who'd you
make the bomb for?

16:46.543 --> 16:48.478
Pavel.

16:48.545 --> 16:49.712
Christian Pavel.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.581
Where do we find him?

16:51.648 --> 16:54.350
I don't know
his phone number.

16:54.418 --> 16:58.021
I meet him
only one place --

16:58.088 --> 17:01.191
Connie's Cafe in Orlando.

17:01.258 --> 17:05.261
Talk to cook --
Nikolai.

17:05.329 --> 17:08.797
Now, promise, you better leave
my daughter alone.

17:08.865 --> 17:11.867
Let's see if your facts
check out.

17:18.742 --> 17:21.944
I guess you're going
to Orlando.

17:22.012 --> 17:23.781
Not it.

17:23.848 --> 17:25.950
What happened to the promise
to run the next errand?

17:26.018 --> 17:27.719
It's null and void
when I say "Not it."

17:27.786 --> 17:28.920
Elsa's got a sunburn,
Mike.

17:28.988 --> 17:31.222
Someone's got to rub on
the aloe vera.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.058
I am sorry
you had to hear that.

17:33.126 --> 17:34.125
I'll survive.

17:34.193 --> 17:35.893
Sam,
you're not "Not it."

17:35.961 --> 17:38.729
Jesse and I need to borrow
Michael for our security gig.

17:38.797 --> 17:40.998
Fi, you're killing me.

17:41.066 --> 17:42.834
I'm sure Connie's Cafe
will be great.

17:42.902 --> 17:43.635
You can get
some cheese fries.

17:45.471 --> 17:47.305
Need some extra manpower?

17:47.373 --> 17:49.608
We need to shake
our smug C.E.O. to his core.

17:49.675 --> 17:51.676
You want to help me
raise the threat level?

17:57.951 --> 18:01.053
<i>A good way to sell your</i>
<i>expertise in protecting people</i>

18:01.120 --> 18:02.487
<i>is to point out holes</i>
<i>in security</i>

18:02.555 --> 18:03.989
<i>that most people</i>
<i>wouldn't notice.</i>

18:04.056 --> 18:05.323
Excuse me.

18:05.391 --> 18:07.459
I'm Jesse Porter.
I work for Mr. Forte.

18:07.527 --> 18:09.761
I need to talk to Ross
about a security issue.

18:09.829 --> 18:11.129
He said you might show up.

18:11.197 --> 18:12.397
And he said he's busy.

18:13.966 --> 18:16.301
You know what?
I guess it's no big deal

18:16.368 --> 18:18.570
that your maintenance workers
are just waltzing through here

18:18.637 --> 18:19.871
with no screening
whatsoever.

18:19.939 --> 18:21.206
Actually,
we screen every per--

18:21.273 --> 18:23.408
Actually, you need to be better
at what you do.

18:23.475 --> 18:25.977
You -- come here.
You too, buddy.

18:26.045 --> 18:27.311
Let's go.

18:27.379 --> 18:29.746
Let's talk about
these maintenance workers.

18:29.814 --> 18:32.282
Shall we?
Who's doing background checks?

18:32.350 --> 18:34.451
<i>Pointing out holes in security</i>
<i>is also a great way</i>

18:34.519 --> 18:37.421
<i>to create new holes</i>
<i>in security.</i>

18:37.488 --> 18:39.022
Matching names on the I.D.'s.
Anyone?

18:39.090 --> 18:40.858
Um...we're on it.

18:40.925 --> 18:42.326
You're <i>on</i> it.

18:42.393 --> 18:43.694
He's on it. Oh.

18:43.761 --> 18:45.095
Wow, you know,
I feel so much better

18:45.163 --> 18:46.430
now that I know
that you're on it.

18:46.498 --> 18:48.465
You tell Mr. Ross
that I stopped by

18:48.533 --> 18:49.933
and that
I'm not impressed.

19:03.113 --> 19:05.414
<i>People tend to</i>
<i>implement security</i>

19:05.482 --> 19:07.716
<i>based on anticipated threats.</i>

19:07.784 --> 19:09.651
<i>They install firewalls</i>
<i>and encryption</i>

19:09.719 --> 19:11.486
<i>if they're afraid</i>
<i>of being hacked.</i>

19:11.554 --> 19:13.388
<i>They use vaults</i>
<i>and armed guards</i>

19:13.456 --> 19:15.358
<i>if they're worried</i>
<i>about being robbed.</i>

19:15.425 --> 19:16.759
What the hell?

19:16.827 --> 19:18.161
<i>And if you need</i>
<i>to get them to keep</i>

19:18.229 --> 19:20.663
<i>their personal security</i>
<i>with them at all times,</i>

19:20.731 --> 19:23.967
<i>you have to make them afraid</i>
<i>to ever be alone.</i>

19:24.035 --> 19:25.402
Uh, who the hell are you?

19:25.470 --> 19:27.872
You may not know who I am,
but I know who you are.

19:27.939 --> 19:29.106
You killed my mother.

19:29.174 --> 19:30.909
What are you
talking about?

19:30.976 --> 19:32.810
I'm talking about
your so-called medicine!

19:32.878 --> 19:35.312
The medicine that
was supposed to save her life.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.381
The medicine
that killed her instead.

19:37.449 --> 19:38.982
The poison
that you pushed on her.

19:39.050 --> 19:40.284
The lies!!

19:40.351 --> 19:42.719
Okay, I can see
that you are very upset.

19:42.787 --> 19:43.986
Why don't we go
to my office,

19:44.054 --> 19:45.321
and we can talk
about this?

19:45.389 --> 19:47.056
Oh, I've talked.
I have talked plenty.

19:47.124 --> 19:48.824
I have talked to
your customer service.

19:48.892 --> 19:50.993
I have talked
to your lawyers.

19:51.060 --> 19:53.328
All you people do is talk.

19:53.395 --> 19:55.698
I am done talking!!

19:57.534 --> 19:59.201
You waiting
for your security guards?

19:59.269 --> 20:00.803
The guards that look through the
cameras? I took those down.

20:00.871 --> 20:04.708
Okay. You win.
We're alone. You got me.

20:04.776 --> 20:05.910
What do you want?

20:05.977 --> 20:07.512
That is a good question.

20:07.579 --> 20:09.281
When my mother was dying,

20:09.348 --> 20:11.550
when I was sitting there
with no hope,

20:11.618 --> 20:14.119
I thought,
"What do I want?"

20:14.187 --> 20:19.125
And as I sat there,
thinking and studying...

20:19.192 --> 20:21.627
Learning about
how to hurt people...

20:21.694 --> 20:24.563
It's scary, really,
how much you can learn

20:24.631 --> 20:26.332
when you put your mind
to it.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.167
You know what else
is scary?

20:28.235 --> 20:29.435
How life
can be so fragile.

20:31.005 --> 20:32.906
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?!

20:32.973 --> 20:34.340
I'm teaching you.

20:34.408 --> 20:36.910
I'm teaching you
what I've learned.

20:36.978 --> 20:38.579
How unfair life can be.

20:41.683 --> 20:43.050
It's so delicate,
so precious,

20:43.118 --> 20:46.487
and then, suddenly,
it's all over in an instant.

20:48.424 --> 20:50.758
Oh, my God!
Please! No!

20:50.826 --> 20:51.926
Please,
just tell me what you want!

20:51.994 --> 20:53.161
I want you to suffer...

20:53.228 --> 20:55.063
every moment
of every single day

20:55.130 --> 20:57.298
for the rest of your life,
just like I do.

20:57.366 --> 20:59.533
And you will.

20:59.601 --> 21:01.235
I promise you, Mr. Forte.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.137
You will.

21:19.921 --> 21:24.925
Where were you?!
The stalker was in my car!

21:24.993 --> 21:26.293
You're fired, all of you.

21:26.361 --> 21:27.761
I'm sorry, sir. I --

21:27.829 --> 21:29.030
You say one word,
and you join them.

21:31.799 --> 21:33.166
I heard explosions.
Sir, you okay?

21:33.234 --> 21:36.937
You have full access to HLX,
any support you need.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.138
All right, Mr. Forte.
All right.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.606
Until that psycho
is behind bars,

21:39.673 --> 21:42.275
you're not leaving
my side.

21:46.023 --> 21:49.043
I'd say James is sufficiently
concerned about his stalker.

21:49.127 --> 21:50.428
I've been told
to protect Sadie,

21:50.495 --> 21:53.597
and Jesse now has full
security access at HLX.

21:53.665 --> 21:55.432
Which means we're one step
closer to the safe

21:55.500 --> 21:56.766
and the gene sequence
inside it.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.702
Yeah,
but the combination --

21:58.769 --> 22:00.903
we're not using the combination.
We're cracking the safe,

22:00.971 --> 22:04.674
which means getting me in there
with safecracking equipment.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.542
Seriously, does this plan
involve any more exploding cars?

22:06.610 --> 22:07.977
Always a good question.

22:08.045 --> 22:09.880
Unfortunately,
the answer's no.

22:09.947 --> 22:11.949
You just make sure
Sadie doesn't get hurt.

22:12.016 --> 22:14.118
Sounds like
you care about more

22:14.186 --> 22:15.486
than just
the gene sequence.

22:15.554 --> 22:17.822
No. I...

22:17.890 --> 22:20.125
I mean, y-yes.

22:20.193 --> 22:23.329
But I know there is no way
that I will ever get her back.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.932
It's been too long.
Too many things have happened.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.234
Relationships
<i>have</i> survived worse.

22:29.770 --> 22:32.206
Will you just promise me
that she'll be okay?

22:32.273 --> 22:34.074
I could care less
about James --

22:34.141 --> 22:35.575
<i>Nothing</i> will happen
to Sadie.

22:37.445 --> 22:40.447
Now, how are you gonna
possibly sneak inside

22:40.515 --> 22:42.216
with a bunch
of safecracking stuff?

22:42.283 --> 22:43.984
Jesse's
taking care of that.

22:47.222 --> 22:49.357
Oh, this is worse
than I figured.

22:49.425 --> 22:51.026
Your office is
a security nightmare.

22:51.093 --> 22:53.696
I'm gonna need to bring in my
equipment to fortify this place.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.098
No, that's ridiculous.
We're perfectly safe here, sir.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.833
As I recall,
that was your assessment

22:57.901 --> 22:59.168
of the parking garage

22:59.236 --> 23:00.636
before Mr. Forte was almost
blown sky-high.

23:00.704 --> 23:03.239
That stalker would have to get
through so many guards

23:03.307 --> 23:04.908
and checkpoints
to get up here.

23:04.976 --> 23:06.443
Or he could
just shoot you.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.545
You need to start thinking
like him -- what does he want?

23:08.612 --> 23:09.846
He wants to show you
that he can get to you

23:09.914 --> 23:11.114
no matter where you are.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.849
He could be lining up
his shot right now.

23:12.917 --> 23:14.718
Now we need to install
some blast-proof windows,

23:14.785 --> 23:16.219
embassy-grade.

23:16.287 --> 23:18.055
Oh, my God. You're serious.
I can take care of that, sir.

23:18.122 --> 23:19.890
As head of security
for the building, I think --

23:19.958 --> 23:21.359
James: No. This is
Mr. Porter's show.

23:21.427 --> 23:23.795
Whatever you need to make
this office safe, you do it.

23:25.097 --> 23:27.231
Just remember -- any contractors
you bring in here,

23:27.299 --> 23:28.432
I'm checking them out.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.734
I'm inspecting
every nut and bolt

23:29.802 --> 23:31.036
you bring
into this building.

23:31.103 --> 23:32.971
Well, there you go.
Can't be too safe, right?

23:33.039 --> 23:34.406
I'm gonna get the ball
rolling soon.

23:34.474 --> 23:35.540
We'll do the installation
this weekend.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.681
You're telling me
that Nikolai quit?

23:42.749 --> 23:44.083
Well, he said he's not
working anymore.

23:44.151 --> 23:45.184
That's what "quit" means.

23:45.252 --> 23:47.020
Oh, boy,
that is just such a shame,

23:47.087 --> 23:48.321
'cause you know
old Nick --

23:48.389 --> 23:50.190
he made the best goulash
in all of Florida.

23:50.257 --> 23:52.292
Would you mind giving me
his number?

23:52.360 --> 23:54.762
'Cause I would love to have him
cater my wife's birthday.

23:54.829 --> 23:56.197
It's kind of a surprise.

23:56.264 --> 23:58.466
Look -- I got to get
back to work.

23:58.533 --> 24:00.301
You write
your number down --

24:00.369 --> 24:01.536
if he comes back in here,

24:01.603 --> 24:02.904
I'll make sure
he gets hold of you.

24:02.972 --> 24:03.972
That's a deal.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.273
Thanks very much.

24:05.341 --> 24:07.442
Name's Chuck.

24:10.446 --> 24:11.613
Michael: Anything?

24:11.681 --> 24:12.814
Well, there was a chef
named Nikolai,

24:12.882 --> 24:14.249
but he quit a week ago.

24:14.317 --> 24:16.418
I slipped the manager $20
to let me know if he showed up,

24:16.486 --> 24:17.886
but I wouldn't
expect a call.

24:17.954 --> 24:18.953
You think they're covering
for him?

24:19.021 --> 24:20.655
No, it didn't seem
like it.

24:20.723 --> 24:23.624
I'm thinking that Nikolai
found out that Lucien was gone

24:23.692 --> 24:24.759
and he just disappeared.

24:24.827 --> 24:25.760
I'll see you back here.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.896
Michael:
Lucien met cook.

24:28.964 --> 24:30.431
He quit last week.

24:30.499 --> 24:33.234
How could I know
Nikolai had left?

24:33.301 --> 24:36.936
I was here in box!
Remember?

24:37.004 --> 24:39.572
Christian Pavel
is my friend.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.541
He bled for me.
We fought side by side.

24:42.609 --> 24:46.245
But I told you,
I don't know where he lives.

24:46.313 --> 24:47.980
He has no phone number.

24:48.047 --> 24:51.383
Nikolai is the only way
to find him.

24:51.451 --> 24:53.552
Well, you're gonna
have to think of another way.

24:55.021 --> 24:58.157
Or the feds are gonna ship
your daughter back to Bucharest.

25:08.502 --> 25:10.270
Hey, hey.

25:10.338 --> 25:11.971
Any progress with Lucien?

25:12.039 --> 25:14.941
Not much. We're letting him
stew for a while.

25:15.009 --> 25:17.410
So this is how I'm getting
into HLX?

25:17.478 --> 25:18.745
Yeah, I can't say
it's gonna be comfy,

25:18.813 --> 25:20.079
but, uh,
the head of security

25:20.147 --> 25:22.115
is inspecting everything
I'm bringing in, so...

25:22.183 --> 25:24.784
We're gonna need
a little magic.

25:24.852 --> 25:26.519
<i>When you're being smuggled</i>
<i>into a secure area,</i>

25:26.587 --> 25:27.887
<i>the best hiding spot</i>

25:27.954 --> 25:29.989
<i>is somewhere</i>
<i>that people are confident</i>

25:30.056 --> 25:31.590
<i>they've checked thoroughly.</i>

25:31.658 --> 25:33.326
<i>By attaching reflective</i>
<i>window tint</i>

25:33.393 --> 25:35.561
<i>to multiple sheets of glass,</i>

25:35.629 --> 25:38.197
<i>you can create what's known</i>
<i>as the infinity illusion.</i>

25:38.265 --> 25:39.765
<i>And just like any magician</i>
<i>won't tell you,</i>

25:39.833 --> 25:42.702
<i>as long as the light</i>
<i>outside the space</i>

25:42.769 --> 25:45.070
<i>remains brighter</i>
<i>than the inside,</i>

25:45.138 --> 25:46.572
<i>you'll be as good as invisible.</i>

25:46.640 --> 25:47.606
All right. Stop.

25:49.409 --> 25:51.945
Sorry to keep you waiting around
all day just to do this, man.

25:52.012 --> 25:54.714
Can't be too safe.

25:54.782 --> 25:56.450
You're bringing a lot
of tools in here.

25:56.517 --> 25:57.818
Yeah, I am.

25:57.886 --> 25:59.654
How about you do your job
and I'll do mine?

25:59.721 --> 26:00.621
Keep this place locked down.

26:27.049 --> 26:28.817
Lab D's that way,
Mikey.

26:28.885 --> 26:31.453
Make as much noise
as you can.

26:33.723 --> 26:35.156
You sure you want to
stick around?

26:35.224 --> 26:36.391
It's gonna get
pretty loud.

26:36.459 --> 26:39.527
How blast-proof
is blast-proof?

26:39.594 --> 26:40.961
Oh, we could fire
a rocket launcher at him.

26:41.029 --> 26:42.462
You'd just need a squeegee
to clean up the mess.

26:59.614 --> 27:01.848
Sir.

27:01.916 --> 27:03.584
Sorry to bother you.

27:03.651 --> 27:05.586
After the other day,

27:05.654 --> 27:08.289
I wanted to install
a few more cameras.

27:08.357 --> 27:10.157
I think there's an extra
lab tech in the north wing.

27:10.225 --> 27:12.726
Footage is from
10 minutes ago.

27:12.794 --> 27:14.995
Could be our guy.
It's hard to tell.

27:16.297 --> 27:17.998
Sure you didn't miscount,
Ross?

27:18.065 --> 27:19.466
I didn't miscount.

27:19.533 --> 27:20.867
Listen,
I'm not taking any chances.

27:20.934 --> 27:22.101
We're headed down there.

27:22.169 --> 27:24.970
You two stay here.
Keep Mr. Forte safe.

27:41.588 --> 27:44.256
<i>When a plan goes wrong,</i>
<i>it's crucial to stay cool.</i>

27:44.324 --> 27:45.557
<i>You may have to bail out,</i>

27:45.625 --> 27:47.592
<i>but how you bail out</i>
<i>is everything.</i>

27:47.660 --> 27:49.895
<i>Do you run</i>
<i>and leave behind evidence</i>

27:49.962 --> 27:52.597
<i>that gives away your plan</i>
<i>to your enemies?</i>

27:52.665 --> 27:57.169
<i>Or do you keep the mission</i>
<i>alive by covering your tracks?</i>

28:14.620 --> 28:17.622
Check "B" and "C."

28:28.201 --> 28:29.535
This place is crawling
with guards.

28:29.602 --> 28:31.403
They'll shoot you before
you get anywhere near the door.

28:31.471 --> 28:33.940
That is your problem.
That is not my problem.

28:36.610 --> 28:38.645
Ross, you see him yet?

28:38.713 --> 28:40.447
Man: Freeze!
Man2: Don't move!

28:40.515 --> 28:42.049
Put your hands
on your head!

28:42.117 --> 28:44.251
I have a little announcement
to make.

28:44.319 --> 28:47.387
Ross here is wired with a half
a pound of high explosive.

28:47.455 --> 28:51.124
You shoot at me,
and we all go boom.

28:51.192 --> 28:53.126
So I'm gonna make it real easy.

28:53.194 --> 28:54.895
You're gonna let me walk
right out the front door.

28:58.032 --> 28:59.934
Oh, my God.

29:05.807 --> 29:09.041
Am I TV? Huh?

29:09.109 --> 29:11.076
Think Mr. Forte's watching?
Huh?

29:11.144 --> 29:11.977
Huh?

29:12.045 --> 29:13.312
Yeah. Grab the radio.

29:13.379 --> 29:15.914
Grab your radio.
Bring it up.

29:15.982 --> 29:17.082
Turn it on.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.283
Turn it on!

29:18.351 --> 29:20.585
Hey, Mr. Forte.

29:20.653 --> 29:21.920
<i>I just want to take</i>
<i>this opportunity</i>

29:21.987 --> 29:23.521
<i>to share something else</i>
<i>I learned</i>

29:23.589 --> 29:25.022
<i>when I was reading</i>
<i>at my mother's deathbed.</i>

29:25.090 --> 29:28.459
You know why hell is scary?

29:28.527 --> 29:30.928
It's not the pain,
it's not the torture,

29:30.996 --> 29:32.396
<i>it's not burning</i>
<i>in a lake of fire.</i>

29:32.464 --> 29:36.767
It's that it lasts forever --
just like me.

29:36.835 --> 29:39.035
So let me be the first
to tell you --

29:39.103 --> 29:41.470
welcome to hell, Mr. Forte.

29:41.538 --> 29:43.105
<i>Welcome to hell.</i>

29:43.173 --> 29:44.573
Somebody, drop that guy.

29:44.641 --> 29:46.708
Somebody shoot him!
Now!

29:46.776 --> 29:48.576
Bad idea.
Bad idea.

29:48.644 --> 29:52.880
Y'all want to die?
You don't want to die.

29:52.947 --> 29:54.781
No one follows.

30:04.229 --> 30:06.523
<i>The morning after</i>
<i>a failed operation</i>

30:06.557 --> 30:07.924
<i>you have two choices.</i>

30:07.992 --> 30:10.093
<i>You can admit defeat</i>
<i>and lick your wounds,</i>

30:10.161 --> 30:12.463
<i>or you can re-engage</i>
<i>immediately,</i>

30:12.530 --> 30:14.031
<i>sticking by your enemy</i>

30:14.099 --> 30:16.633
<i>so you'll be in position</i>
<i>when you find another opening.</i>

30:16.701 --> 30:19.504
All right, so our associates
are analyzing the security tape

30:19.572 --> 30:21.440
from yesterday. We're hoping
to get a lead on our guy.

30:21.507 --> 30:23.475
And you really think
that your team

30:23.543 --> 30:24.843
is better than the cops
for that.

30:24.911 --> 30:26.812
Without a doubt.

30:26.879 --> 30:29.181
So in the meantime, we're gonna
need to do a top-down

30:29.248 --> 30:30.348
security review of HLX --

30:30.416 --> 30:32.184
just completely
lock this place down.

30:32.252 --> 30:33.919
No, no, no. It's clear that he can
get to me whenever he wants.

30:33.987 --> 30:36.121
The spectrum analyzer
is smashed.

30:36.189 --> 30:37.823
Those samples are ruined.

30:37.891 --> 30:40.158
And the research
inside of that safe

30:40.226 --> 30:41.994
is worth
a billion dollars --

30:42.061 --> 30:43.495
easily.

30:43.563 --> 30:45.564
Well, then, we'll bring in
better guards to protect it.

30:45.632 --> 30:46.765
No, we're moving it
off-site.

30:46.833 --> 30:48.835
I've already talked
to Ross.

30:48.902 --> 30:50.370
I'm taking the research to
a bank vault up in Palm Beach.

30:50.438 --> 30:52.472
And...you're sure
you want to trust Ross...

30:52.540 --> 30:53.841
with that? No, no.

30:53.908 --> 30:56.143
Mr. Forte --
This isn't up for discussion.

30:56.211 --> 30:58.746
I am telling you
what is happening.

30:58.814 --> 31:01.749
An armored truck
is on its way.

31:01.817 --> 31:02.984
Fiona, you're to keep Sadie
safe at home.

31:03.052 --> 31:04.853
Wait,
where are you going?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.087
I'll be in the convoy,

31:06.155 --> 31:07.455
and Mr. Porter here
is coming with me.

31:07.523 --> 31:10.625
No, James. You can't risk
your life for some research.

31:10.693 --> 31:13.394
Well Sadie,
I appreciate your input,

31:13.462 --> 31:15.496
but you run
our third-world outreach,

31:15.564 --> 31:18.465
and I will take care of
the business side of things.

31:18.533 --> 31:20.834
You meet me here
in an hour.

31:29.177 --> 31:30.812
Jesse: What comes to mind
when you think

31:30.879 --> 31:32.981
of the First Federal Bank
of Palm Beach?

31:33.048 --> 31:34.816
The most secure vaults
in South Florida.

31:34.884 --> 31:36.919
Why?

31:36.986 --> 31:39.121
I'm afraid that's where
my least favorite C.E.O.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.823
is taking the gene sequence.
Oh, great.

31:40.891 --> 31:42.992
The only place safer
than inside HLX.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.694
We're -- we're done.
It's over.

31:44.762 --> 31:46.196
Not necessarily.

31:46.263 --> 31:49.131
We just need to grab it
before it gets to Palm Beach.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.399
Well, that's easier said
than done.

31:50.466 --> 31:51.266
James is using
an armored truck.

31:51.334 --> 31:52.467
Two cars full of guards.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.970
Armed convoy.
I don't like our numbers.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.438
We don't need numbers.

31:56.506 --> 31:59.007
We just need to convince James
that his armed convoy

31:59.075 --> 32:01.076
won't keep him
or the gene sequence safe.

32:01.143 --> 32:03.545
Well, I'm riding along.
We'll have the route.

32:03.612 --> 32:04.975
I'll call Sam, see if I can't
slow you guys down.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.200
All right.

32:06.615 --> 32:08.550
You got to let me help,
if there's anything I can do.

32:08.618 --> 32:10.219
All right. I'm gonna get over
to Sadie's place.

32:15.492 --> 32:19.262
<i>Even a fender-bender can stop</i>
<i>traffic for a few minutes,</i>

32:19.330 --> 32:21.431
<i>but creating</i>
<i>a longer-lasting roadblock</i>

32:21.499 --> 32:24.969
<i>is about provoking</i>
<i>an emergency response.</i>

32:25.036 --> 32:26.570
<i>Cops and firefighters</i>
<i>won't go anywhere near</i>

32:26.638 --> 32:29.005
<i>a burning chemical truck</i>
<i>billowing smoke</i>

32:29.073 --> 32:30.440
<i>that looks toxic.</i>

32:30.508 --> 32:33.375
<i>Which means you can get</i>
<i>four hours of roadblock</i>

32:33.443 --> 32:36.845
<i>with a smoke canister</i>
<i>and a little gasoline.</i>

32:43.518 --> 32:45.986
What do you think?

32:46.053 --> 32:47.120
Looks scary.

32:47.188 --> 32:48.622
Good.
That's the idea.

32:51.592 --> 32:54.728
Now let's get out of here.

33:07.009 --> 33:08.943
Jesse: Come on,
it's taking forever, Ross.

33:09.011 --> 33:10.611
What, are you getting paid
by the mile?

33:10.679 --> 33:12.680
Ross: We're not taking
this route for the scenery.

33:12.748 --> 33:14.749
Now stay off the radio.

33:14.817 --> 33:16.218
All right, as soon
as the research is safe,

33:16.285 --> 33:17.219
we're taking you
underground.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.791
What the hell?

33:21.859 --> 33:23.793
Oh, come on.

33:23.861 --> 33:26.496
Come <i>on.</i>

33:28.466 --> 33:29.566
Cop: Nobody's getting
through here.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.234
Ross: But we're heading
to Palm Beach.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.969
Y'all got to take the detour
to I-95,

33:33.036 --> 33:34.203
down that road
a few miles.

33:34.271 --> 33:35.738
Unbelievable.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.340
There had to be
an accident!

33:37.407 --> 33:38.508
Today of all days!

33:38.575 --> 33:40.376
You know what?
This is no accident.

33:40.443 --> 33:42.978
No, this is way too convenient.
This is your stalker.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.816
We have kept this whole thing
completely under wraps.

33:46.883 --> 33:49.018
How would he even know
we took this road?

33:49.086 --> 33:50.987
Well, that's a damn
good question -- Ross?

33:51.055 --> 33:53.056
Tell anybody our route?
No. Of course not.

33:53.124 --> 33:54.625
Let's get moving.

33:54.692 --> 33:56.427
No. No. We're not going anywhere
until we sort this out.

33:56.494 --> 33:59.363
You stay put.

33:59.431 --> 34:02.032
<i>Sleight-of-hand tricks</i>
<i>aren't just for kiddie parties.</i>

34:02.100 --> 34:03.501
<i>The same misdirection</i>
<i>and quick moves</i>

34:03.568 --> 34:06.670

34:11.976 --> 34:13.443
What the hell
are you doing?

34:13.511 --> 34:14.643
Are you kidding me?!

34:14.712 --> 34:16.446
Your car's bugged.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.514
I never saw that before.

34:18.581 --> 34:20.382
Yeah, of course not,
because you're bad at your job.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.650
Did you sweep
the armored truck?

34:22.719 --> 34:23.985
Did you sweep
the other town car?

34:24.053 --> 34:25.387
The only car that I know is safe
is the Mercedes

34:25.454 --> 34:26.987
because I searched it myself
this morning.

34:27.056 --> 34:28.724
Sweep the other cars!
Go!

34:34.764 --> 34:36.464
This guy is ahead of us
at every turn.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.699
He could be anywhere.

34:37.766 --> 34:39.333
All right, well,
we need to think like him.

34:39.402 --> 34:40.467
Where does he want us
to go?

34:40.536 --> 34:42.704
The detour, 95.

34:42.772 --> 34:43.737
Maybe if we take
the back roads.

34:43.806 --> 34:45.306
With this many vehicles,

34:45.373 --> 34:47.609
he's gonna be able to spot us
no matter where we are.

34:47.676 --> 34:50.511
Our best bet -- we have Ross
take the Mercedes to 95,

34:50.578 --> 34:52.379
with the convoy.

34:52.447 --> 34:53.714
Use that as a decoy.

34:53.782 --> 34:55.248
Then you and I, we split off,
we go our own way.

34:55.315 --> 34:57.517
I can't leave the research.

34:57.585 --> 34:58.452
Then bring it.
Bring it with you.

34:58.519 --> 35:01.755
You want me

35:01.822 --> 35:03.389
to pull my stuff
out of the armored truck?

35:03.457 --> 35:06.192
The armored truck,
your car -- they're targets.

35:08.529 --> 35:11.130
You have worked for me
for five days.

35:11.198 --> 35:14.768
I cannot believe that I am
seriously considering this.

35:14.836 --> 35:16.503
Mr. Forte,
it's completely your call.

35:18.206 --> 35:19.206
Whatever you think
is safest.

35:24.313 --> 35:27.382
Change of plans!
Open the truck!

35:32.555 --> 35:36.724
No sign of him yet.
I'm gonna call Ross.

35:36.791 --> 35:38.325
No, no. No way.
Stay off your phone.

35:38.393 --> 35:40.894
We got to take
every precaution.

35:40.962 --> 35:43.196
Yeah, good...thought.

35:45.233 --> 35:48.168
W-where are you going?

35:48.236 --> 35:50.204
I just have a...
quick stop to make.

36:00.183 --> 36:01.350
Oh, my God.
Back up -- now.

36:01.417 --> 36:02.751
Back up! Let's go!

36:02.819 --> 36:04.420
Oh, no, no, no.
Um, actually, this is our stop.

36:06.423 --> 36:07.523
That's your cue
to get out.

36:07.591 --> 36:09.558
Get out of the car.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.606
Y-you're supposed --

36:23.673 --> 36:24.740
Michael: I wanted to tell you
the good news, Mr. Forte.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.242
I'm not your stalker.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.610
Dan is.

36:29.046 --> 36:30.613
What, are you surprised
to see me

36:30.681 --> 36:32.615
after dumping me
in a Chilean prison to die?

36:32.683 --> 36:34.417
Hey, jackpot!

36:34.485 --> 36:35.952
Now I know why you
wanted to keep this safe.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.054
There's more than just
a gene sequence in here.

36:38.122 --> 36:41.291
We've got records of payoffs,
medical trial reports.

36:41.358 --> 36:42.725
You've been naughty.

36:42.793 --> 36:44.727
Oh, that's what this is
all about.

36:44.795 --> 36:46.863
This is --
you're all in on this.

36:46.931 --> 36:49.867
This is just about
ripping me off, huh?

36:49.934 --> 36:51.769
No, we're just taking back
what was rightfully mine.

36:51.836 --> 36:55.339
What the hell?

36:55.407 --> 36:58.442
We can make all of this go away.
You just name your price.

36:58.510 --> 37:02.546
Don't you get it?
This was <i>never</i> about money.

37:02.614 --> 37:04.482
This was about
saving lives.

37:04.549 --> 37:06.418
This was about my company.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.486
This was about you stealing
the only woman

37:08.554 --> 37:09.755
that I ever loved.

37:09.822 --> 37:12.591
You want to save lives --
let's save lives.

37:12.659 --> 37:15.093
I'll give you a piece
of the company.

37:15.161 --> 37:16.528
Sadie was no catch.

37:16.596 --> 37:17.963
You can consider
yourself lucky.

37:18.031 --> 37:20.198
You just tell me
what you want,

37:20.266 --> 37:23.335
and we can make
all of this go away.

37:27.573 --> 37:30.875
Sadie, I-I can explain.

37:30.943 --> 37:32.343
I've heard everything
I need to.

37:32.411 --> 37:34.812
And we have everything
we need.

37:47.627 --> 37:51.563
Getting back into HLX
is gonna be a long process,

37:51.631 --> 37:54.066
but it sounds like the Board
of Directors is on my side.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.635
Your old friend James
won't be around for a while.

37:56.703 --> 37:58.738
He's looking at 5 to 10
for conspiracy.

37:58.805 --> 37:59.906
Yeah, he's stiffing me
on the security gig.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.107
Thanks for that, Fi.

38:01.175 --> 38:02.842
All right,
I got to get back to work.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.277
Good luck with
everything, Dan.

38:04.344 --> 38:05.812
- Thank you. Thanks so much.
- All right.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.714
And I-I really want to
thank you guys --

38:07.782 --> 38:09.148
for everything.

38:09.216 --> 38:10.817
And, uh, Sadie wants to
thank you, too.

38:10.885 --> 38:12.552
No, we're just talking,
getting reacquainted.

38:12.620 --> 38:15.656
I mean, it's never gonna be...
How it was,

38:15.724 --> 38:17.625
but it's a start.

38:17.693 --> 38:21.329
You guys have
a second chance.

38:21.397 --> 38:22.564
Thanks again.

38:24.401 --> 38:26.602
I hope he makes
the most of it.

38:26.670 --> 38:29.939
He escaped prison and traveled
a few thousand miles

38:30.007 --> 38:31.308
to get her back.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.409
That <i>should</i> count
for something.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.877
Grand gestures
are great.

38:33.945 --> 38:37.113
Sometimes I think
it's the day-to-day stuff

38:37.181 --> 38:38.916
that's the hard work.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.485
You know who I am, Fi.
I'm not --

38:41.552 --> 38:43.787
Yeah...I know.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.256
And I know
that you and Sam

38:46.324 --> 38:49.126
have a Romanian bomb maker
to break,

38:49.194 --> 38:50.595
so, uh,
we'll talk later.

38:57.761 --> 38:59.495
Lucien: I know this place
is not so bad --

39:00.281 --> 39:02.816
the chairs, the carrots --

39:02.884 --> 39:05.452
I'm starting to like
our conversations.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.920
One way or another,
they're about to end.

39:06.988 --> 39:08.921
Either you tell us
how to find the guy

39:08.989 --> 39:10.656
who you built
the bomb for,

39:10.724 --> 39:14.660
or your daughter's on
the next flight to Bucharest.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.530
Very well.
I'll tell you.

39:17.598 --> 39:20.532
There's a pier
in Daytona Beach.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.135
You walk
to the end of it...

39:23.202 --> 39:24.869
jump off,

39:24.937 --> 39:27.771
swim to the bottom
of the ocean,

39:27.839 --> 39:31.475
and you call out,
"Vladimir."

39:31.542 --> 39:32.375
You think I'm bluffing.

39:37.247 --> 39:38.180
What was that?

39:38.248 --> 39:39.782
Sam: I don't know.

39:41.551 --> 39:45.121
That trip to the diner
was a distress call.

39:47.124 --> 39:52.096
You think I would give up
my friend after so many years?

39:52.163 --> 39:56.067
There are bonds
no man can break.

39:56.135 --> 39:59.037
Now my friend has come
to rescue me.

39:59.104 --> 40:00.305
Let me go,

40:00.373 --> 40:04.043
and maybe I'll tell him
to let one of you live.

40:05.878 --> 40:06.945
Mike, get down!

40:08.915 --> 40:11.317
<i>Work long enough as a spy,</i>

40:11.384 --> 40:13.152
<i>and you learn</i>
<i>that distress calls</i>

40:13.220 --> 40:14.855
<i>don't always work exactly</i>
<i>as planned.</i>

40:14.922 --> 40:16.690
<i>Just because someone</i>
<i>calls for help</i>

40:16.758 --> 40:18.425
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're going to get it.</i>

40:18.493 --> 40:20.494
<i>A surprisingly high percentage</i>
<i>of the time,</i>

40:26.969 --> 40:30.271

40:30.339 --> 40:31.873
I...

40:31.941 --> 40:35.343
Lucien, he betrayed you!
You still want to protect him?!

40:35.411 --> 40:37.145
Mike,
we got to go -- now!

40:37.213 --> 40:38.780
Get us some cover.
With what?

40:38.848 --> 40:41.249
I don't know! Something!
Just get it fast!

40:56.499 --> 40:57.866
About my daughter.

40:59.669 --> 41:01.903
Give me your word!

41:01.970 --> 41:03.137
I give you my word.

41:03.205 --> 41:04.372
You give us
the information,

41:04.440 --> 41:05.673
and your daughter
will be left alone.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.910
The man outside...

41:08.978 --> 41:11.012
he needed a bomb.

41:11.080 --> 41:14.048
He was my friend,
and so I said yes.

41:14.116 --> 41:16.819
Where, Lucien?!
Where is his place?

41:16.886 --> 41:19.921
Warehouse...
in Wynwood...

41:19.989 --> 41:21.556
end of Burnnam Road.

41:22.925 --> 41:24.359
And when you find him,

41:24.426 --> 41:27.562
put a bullet in him.

41:30.232 --> 41:32.233
Okay,
I think I got us covered.

41:32.301 --> 41:33.568
Let's go.

41:47.884 --> 41:50.419
He's gone, Mike.

41:50.486 --> 41:51.853
We lost our only lead.

41:51.921 --> 41:53.855
Not quite. Lucien told me
where to find him.

41:53.923 --> 41:57.293
Well, then, I think we owe
that son of a bitch a visit.
