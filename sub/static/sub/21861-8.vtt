00:19.120 --> 00:20.160
[man on game]  Run!

00:20.220 --> 00:23.150
[Mackenzie] Thank you.
I just dyed it, actually.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.290
[Mackenzie chuckles]

00:28.290 --> 00:31.130
Yeah? Why are you running away,
like a little bitch?

00:32.700 --> 00:33.770
Ah.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.330
That was bullshit.

00:37.540 --> 00:38.640
[sighs]

00:42.580 --> 00:43.450
Your turn.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.350
[gunfire, explosions, and chattering
continue on video game]

00:48.410 --> 00:51.550
Um, will your roommates be out of town,
or what?

00:53.150 --> 00:54.320
[Dylan nearby] What's up, Ruff?

00:54.390 --> 00:55.530
[Ruff barks, then door opens]

00:55.590 --> 00:57.860
-Mac, you still--?
-Dylan, what the fuck? Can you get--?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.160
I was changing, Dylan. Knock.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.770
[Dylan] It's nothing
I haven't seen before.

01:01.830 --> 01:02.800
[Mackenzie scoffs]

01:02.860 --> 01:04.489
I brought you dog food, babe.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.160
Thank you for the dog food.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.580
What? Why did you say, "Home bored"?

01:14.640 --> 01:15.770
-[Mackenzie] Can you go?
-I thought--

01:15.840 --> 01:17.570
[Mackenzie] Can you just go, Dylan?
Please?

01:19.450 --> 01:20.320
[Dylan] Seriously?

01:21.410 --> 01:22.280
[Mackenzie] Yeah.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.280
[Dylan] Fine.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.320
[Peter]  The school board never had
any hard evidence

01:59.390 --> 02:01.390
connecting Dylan Maxwell to the vandalism.

02:01.790 --> 02:05.360
He was a known dick drawer,
so, he fit the profile.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.570
They didn't need hard evidence
to expel him,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
but we needed it to exonerate him.

02:12.270 --> 02:14.270
[Mackenzie on video]  Will your
roommates be out of town, or what?

02:14.370 --> 02:15.570
Dude, what the fuck?

02:17.940 --> 02:19.940
-[Dylan on video]  Hey, Mac, you still--?
-[Mackenzie]  Oh, my God. Dylan--

02:24.710 --> 02:26.570
Dylan, you know what that means, right?

02:26.650 --> 02:27.920
She's fucking cheating on me.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.690
That video places you
at Mackenzie's at 2:09 p.m.,

02:37.990 --> 02:40.460
which means
that you couldn't have drawn the dicks.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.760
That video exonerates you.

02:48.370 --> 02:49.610
She had this the whole time?

02:51.700 --> 02:52.570
Apparently.

02:57.980 --> 02:59.380
Who should we show this to?

03:07.890 --> 03:08.760
Everyone.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.400
[Peter]  We decided to start
with Dylan's attorney.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.070
Dylan, how's your mother?

03:15.330 --> 03:16.870
What's up, man? She's chill.

03:19.970 --> 03:20.870
I'm Sam.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.660
-[Morgan] Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.040
[Peter] Hi, Mr. Morgan. Peter.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.800
Peter. What you guys got for me?

03:27.310 --> 03:29.480
[Sam] Right here.
Do you know what Twitch is?

03:29.540 --> 03:30.410
No.

03:30.780 --> 03:34.090
[Peter] Uh, Twitch is a live-streaming app

03:34.350 --> 03:37.360
that lets other people
watch you play video games.

03:37.420 --> 03:40.630
Yeah, you can make either private streams
or public streams.

03:40.690 --> 03:44.800
This video is a private stream
from Mackenzie Wagner's archives.

03:45.390 --> 03:48.920
It says "2:09 p.m., March 15th."
It's even geotagged.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.600
Uh, Dylan's in the video.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.460
He could not have been
at the parking lot doing the dicks.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.560
See, dude?
Told you I was telling the truth.

03:55.870 --> 03:57.910
All right, well, then that's great, guys.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.670
Um, there's video of Dylan
playing the game?

04:00.740 --> 04:02.840
[Peter] He's not the one
who's playing the video game,

04:02.910 --> 04:03.880
but he's in the video.

04:03.940 --> 04:07.110
Yeah, you can see him very clearly
in the background. Here, I'll show you.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.080
-Whoa! Uh, what is that?
-[Sam] Oh, don't worry. Don't worry.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.910
[Dylan] You've never seen
tits before, Dave?

04:11.980 --> 04:13.350
Turn that off. Yeah, I--

04:13.420 --> 04:14.590
Those are minor tits.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.620
No, dude, those are not minor tits.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.820
[Morgan] Okay, stop recording.

04:18.890 --> 04:20.019
[Peter] It's fine, she's 18.

04:20.790 --> 04:21.860
Stop recording.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.460
[Peter]  Understandably,
it took some explaining

04:24.530 --> 04:27.430
for Dylan's attorney
to make sense of what he was looking at.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.830
And while he wouldn't let me
turn my camera back on,

04:29.900 --> 04:32.470
he did agree that hard evidence like this

04:32.540 --> 04:35.810
would get us an expedited hearing
to appeal Dylan's expulsion.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.050
...time-stamp and geotag.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.910
This proves that my client, Dylan Maxwell,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.450
could not have been
at the site in question,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.890
on the date in question, at that time.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.410
Allegedly.

04:48.090 --> 04:51.000
This evidence shows
that my client is innocent,

04:51.120 --> 04:52.820
and I would respectfully request

04:52.890 --> 04:56.020
that he be reinstated
to Hanover High School immediately.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.040
[Peter] So, um, how have people
welcomed you back?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.410
Are, like, people hostile towards you,
or are they welcoming of you?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.640
Uh, dude, people are
all about me right now.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.740
I walked into school this morning,
everyone was like, "Yo, Dylan.

05:12.550 --> 05:14.620
What up, dude? Glad to have you back."

05:14.680 --> 05:16.010
[boy] Dylan!

05:16.080 --> 05:20.450
-Victory blunt right now. Tell me about--
-No. Don't pull that shit out right now.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.120
-You're right, you're right. Yeah, yeah.
-I'm trying to be good and everything.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.050
Hey, Dylan. It's good to have you back.

05:26.690 --> 05:27.990
[Dylan] Ming, I love you, man.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.030
I missed that guy.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.900
People I didn't know are coming up to me,
like, "I missed you, dude." I was like:

05:36.740 --> 05:39.040
"All right.
I mean, I don't know you, but..."

05:39.670 --> 05:41.840
-Hey.
-Can you draw a dick in my yearbook?

05:42.110 --> 05:43.880
Uh, yeah.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.520
I signed a dick
in a girl's yearbook this morning.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.820
You saw that.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.490
I was like, "You want me
to draw a dick in your yearbook?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.130
Okay, but..."

05:54.750 --> 05:58.090
But that's probably gonna be worth
a shit ton of money in a few years.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.560
Don't forget the ball hair.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.870
Of course not.

06:01.990 --> 06:02.860
Come on.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.740
Never forget.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.230
Shit,
you think she was trying to sell that?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.950
'Cause-- Oh, fuck.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.750
[Peter]  Dylan was never
the most popular kid in school.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.010
But after his reinstatement
he was like a celebrity.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.850
- Everyone was happy to see him.
-"Don't forget the hair."

06:24.920 --> 06:25.790
[all laugh]

06:25.850 --> 06:28.020
[Peter]  Well, almost everyone.

06:29.620 --> 06:30.990
I really thought I saw him.

06:34.760 --> 06:39.490
I look back and I replay it in my mind,
and I... I just thought I saw him.

06:39.570 --> 06:43.570
But there was so much fucking pressure
on me to tell them who did it.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.500
I'm definitely worried
he's gonna beat me up.

06:48.070 --> 06:50.070
That's definitely
my biggest fear right now.

06:58.820 --> 06:59.690
Hey, man.

07:01.650 --> 07:04.890
Look, I'm really sorry
how everything... went down.

07:05.890 --> 07:09.220
I really thought it was you,
but obviously it... wasn't.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.190
The guy looked just like you, I swear.

07:12.270 --> 07:15.010
Like, this could have happened to anyone.
Hundred percent.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.570
I just hope you can find it in your heart
to forgive me.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.770
I mean, lunch was on the line,
and there's just so much fucking pressure.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.310
I swear to God,
I did not mean to do this on purpose,

07:25.580 --> 07:26.680
and I would never do--

07:28.810 --> 07:31.250
Someday... we're gonna get even.

07:32.690 --> 07:38.130
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
maybe not even the day after that.

07:39.630 --> 07:43.230
But someday you're gonna get
what's coming to you, Trimboli.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.200
Oops. Looks like it was today.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.220
[Peter]  While he was expelled,

08:05.280 --> 08:09.280
Dylan talked constantly about beating
Trimboli's ass the next time he saw him.

08:10.260 --> 08:14.970
But fortunately for Alex,
Dylan Maxwell had some new resolutions.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.960
[Dylan]  I'm not just gonna come in
like Old Dylan,

08:18.030 --> 08:22.200
and be fucking around
and doing Old Dylan stuff.

08:22.270 --> 08:25.210
I'm a new man.
I'm gonna put in 100 percent.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.850
And the teachers are gonna be like...
They're gonna be looking at me like...

08:31.680 --> 08:37.919
Like, "Dylan, wow, you're really...
Dylan is really... participating."

08:38.750 --> 08:42.020
In 1914, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand
was assassinated,

08:42.090 --> 08:43.890
which ignited which incident?

08:45.990 --> 08:47.220
Dylan? All right, which war?

08:48.330 --> 08:49.670
The War of 1812?

08:50.700 --> 08:51.740
No.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.270
You know, I get there,
and I'm answering questions,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.930
and, you know, I have a pencil.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.200
You know, I'm actually writing answers
on the whiteboard instead of dicks.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.850
And I'm not making whale noises,

09:06.210 --> 09:09.940
and I'm not, you know,
pulling my balls out of my waistband,

09:10.020 --> 09:12.090
and being like,
"Hey, look at my belt buckle,"

09:12.150 --> 09:14.220
and then they look, and I'm like... Nut.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.220
Okay, everyone has their packets.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.060
Does anyone need a pencil?

09:20.230 --> 09:22.770
Nope. Not me. I brought my own.

09:26.370 --> 09:30.010
I might even bring an extra pencil,
just to, like, give to someone,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.380
just to be, like,
"Hey, did you forget your pencil?"

09:32.440 --> 09:36.250
Then they'll be like, "Actually, yeah,"
and I'll be like, "I have an extra one."

09:36.310 --> 09:40.050
And they'll be like... [mimics explosion]
"What the fuck?"

09:41.280 --> 09:43.710
I can't wait
to see Shapiro apologize to me.

09:44.750 --> 09:50.080
Like, "Oh, Dylan, I'm so sorry. You know,
I didn't mean to accuse you of the dicks."

09:50.690 --> 09:52.890
I'll be like, "Shut up, Shapiro."

09:56.730 --> 09:58.070
[Shapiro] You're going to graduate.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.760
That much has been made clear,

09:59.830 --> 10:03.300
so, I guess, to that end,
some congratulations are in order.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.710
[Dylan] Thank you.

10:05.940 --> 10:09.150
[Shapiro] I'm sorry
that I suspected you vandalized the cars.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.080
But let's be honest with each other,
Dylan.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.490
You have terrorized me for four years,
in and out of this classroom,

10:16.820 --> 10:18.360
and your brother, four before that.

10:18.420 --> 10:23.030
So, yes, I'm sorry
that I suspected you vandalized the cars.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.920
I was wrong about that.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.970
But I don't believe I was wrong about you.

10:28.930 --> 10:31.170
So, good luck to you, Mr. Maxwell.

10:43.780 --> 10:47.120
[Dylan] You know, I couldn't wait to shove
my acceptance letter in Shapiro's face,

10:47.410 --> 10:50.040
but, uh... got a letter from Boulder.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.920
Said they regret me to inform me

10:55.050 --> 10:57.380
they will not be able
to offer me admission.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.260
And that I should apply for January.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.960
[Peter] Did you think
that you were gonna get in?

11:08.100 --> 11:12.870
I mean, I was on the wait list, so, yeah,
I thought I was probably gonna get in.

11:14.970 --> 11:19.470
But... I guess now I have to stay
in fucking Oceanside.

11:21.910 --> 11:22.810
Like my brother.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.150
[knock on door]

11:32.320 --> 11:33.190
Hey.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.360
[Mackenzie] Can we talk?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.430
Look, I fucked up.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.210
[Dylan] Yeah.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.300
[Mackenzie] And no matter what you think,

11:45.370 --> 11:47.800
I just want you to know that I am sorry.
Okay?

11:48.010 --> 11:51.480
I should have given you the video
when I know it could have gotten you off.

11:51.910 --> 11:52.570
I...

11:55.480 --> 11:58.350
Look, I just want you to know
that I didn't mean to.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.990
Okay? I was...

12:03.220 --> 12:07.250
I was embarrassed,
and... I didn't wanna hurt you.

12:07.330 --> 12:09.600
Right after
we had just gotten back together again.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.270
And I wish I could take it back,
but I can't.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.360
I didn't get into Boulder.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.140
I'm sorry, Dylan.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.010
Hey, at least you tried, right?

12:29.010 --> 12:32.380
Yeah, but, you know, that was the plan.
We were supposed to go together.

12:35.850 --> 12:38.250
I mean, Boulder was always a bit
of a stretch for you.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.120
Right?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.970
[Dylan] Long-distance
relationships are tough.

12:50.070 --> 12:54.280
I mean... we could try to make it work,
but...

12:56.280 --> 12:58.480
But I would have to get faster Wi-Fi,
and...

13:00.010 --> 13:02.880
I mean, I just... Just don't really know.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.620
I don't think we should get back together,
Dylan.

13:08.450 --> 13:09.320
What?

13:11.390 --> 13:13.090
What do you mean? Why are you here?

13:14.490 --> 13:18.190
I really just came to apologize. Um...

13:22.330 --> 13:23.600
I'm ready to move on.

13:26.010 --> 13:30.310
I'm ready to start over, and I don't know,
I think that's what's best for both of us.

13:36.080 --> 13:36.940
Yeah, well...

13:39.620 --> 13:41.630
I'd never take back a cheater anyway,
so...

14:03.510 --> 14:04.720
[Peter]  Just a few days earlier,

14:05.240 --> 14:09.340
Dylan received a hero's welcome
when he returned to Hanover High.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.630
But on the evening of the senior prom,
Dylan sits on his couch, drinking whiskey.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.360
Dismissed by Shapiro,
rejected from Boulder,

14:20.090 --> 14:21.690
and rebuffed by Mackenzie Wagner.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.470
So, what was it like,
watching yourself in the documentary?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.610
I actually didn't watch it.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.610
You're joking.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.500
Wait, why didn't you watch it?

14:37.110 --> 14:37.980
I don't know.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.390
I mean... I didn't draw the dicks.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.680
So, I already knew the ending.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.720
[Peter]  Dylan later clarified
that he sat down once or twice

14:50.990 --> 14:54.020
to watch the documentary,
but couldn't bring himself to do it.

14:54.690 --> 14:58.290
He knew everyone thought he was guilty.
He didn't need the doc to remind him

14:58.360 --> 15:00.460
he was expelled
for a crime he didn't commit.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.740
But now that he's been proven innocent,
things are different.

15:04.340 --> 15:07.680
For the first time, Dylan is well-liked
among the student body.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.200
He never really cared
about his reputation,

15:10.510 --> 15:13.580
but after a month of loneliness
and false accusations,

15:13.780 --> 15:15.790
Dylan is enjoying the recognition.

15:16.420 --> 15:19.290
That's why he's off
to Caleb Van der Holme's after-prom party,

15:19.350 --> 15:20.610
ready to make an entrance.

15:20.690 --> 15:22.430
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

15:22.490 --> 15:25.230
[chattering and laughing]

15:31.060 --> 15:32.130
Yo, Pete. Ready?

15:32.400 --> 15:33.640
[Pete] Yeah, man. Let's do it.

15:33.730 --> 15:35.730
What's up, motherfuckers?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.700
[all cheering]

15:36.770 --> 15:38.780
Yeah! It's Peter!

15:39.470 --> 15:42.600
Vandal! Vandal! Vandal!

15:42.740 --> 15:45.770
Vandal! Vandal! Vandal!

15:46.110 --> 15:49.040
Vandal! Vandal! Vandal...!

15:51.180 --> 15:52.050
Yo, yo.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.480
[all yelling]

15:56.760 --> 15:59.730
-Yeah! Pete, Pete, Pete!
-That's my boy right there.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.290
That's my boy right there.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.790
-Who that? That's my boy right there.
-Get me a shot.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.390
Hey, Pete, Pete, come on.
Give him the camera.

16:06.470 --> 16:08.210
Hey, Spencer, take the camera. Pete.

16:08.270 --> 16:09.770
-Hey, I'm good.
-Come on, come on.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.480
-[girl] Where did it go?
-[Brianna] This is Dylan.

16:11.540 --> 16:14.180
-Hey. You get over here.
-Hey.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.310
-Get over here.
-[Lucas] Here's yours, dude.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.180
-No, give me half.
-You can't say no.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.070
[Spencer] It'll make
your dick bigger, Pete.

16:20.150 --> 16:21.420
Don't-- Why would you smell it?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.240
-Pete's got a shot!
-Pete's got a shot!

16:24.320 --> 16:25.560
[all cheering]

16:26.250 --> 16:29.650
So, you're gonna go down, up, down,
and then drink. All right?

16:29.720 --> 16:30.580
Come on, dude.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.200
[boy] He doesn't know
a fucking thing about me, dude.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.360
[Dylan] All right, come on, Pete.
Come on, Pete.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.420
Come on, Pete.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.170
I need to talk to you.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.830
[Lucas] Oh, guys, go.
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.730
[Spencer] Oh, shit, Sara Pearson, dude.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.670
What you did is not okay.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.510
Your documentary fucked
with people's lives.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.540
-Didn't mean to mess with anyone's lives.
-Let me finish.

16:52.850 --> 16:54.490
How do you think Mackenzie feels?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.310
How do you think I feel?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.310
You put people on blast, and for what?

17:00.190 --> 17:01.430
I had to find the truth. I--

17:01.490 --> 17:03.860
What did my hookup list have to do
with the truth?

17:04.359 --> 17:07.260
It didn't prove anything.
It had nothing to do with Dylan.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.400
It was just humiliating.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.140
My dad saw it, Peter.

17:13.270 --> 17:14.810
Do you have any idea how that feels?

17:20.170 --> 17:20.829
I'm sorry, I--

17:20.910 --> 17:21.910
-Fuck you.
-I...

17:32.280 --> 17:33.150
All right. Again?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.530
-[Dylan] Oh, yeah.
-[Lucas] Yep. Let's do it.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.320
[Peter]  I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't a little embarrassed

17:38.390 --> 17:40.450
when Sara Pearson called me out
at the party.

17:42.590 --> 17:45.830
But I felt like I should include it.
Because she's right.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.800
I took a private conversation
from her iPad

17:48.870 --> 17:51.640
and talked about her hookup list
like it was public record.

17:52.740 --> 17:53.610
And for what?

17:54.670 --> 17:57.700
To show that the school board's
key witness lied about a hand job?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.810
A claim only vaguely related to Dylan
in the first place?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.810
I understand that Sara won't forgive me.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.180
And if I were in her shoes,
I wouldn't, either.

18:08.190 --> 18:09.860
I can't really defend myself.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.750
Looks like, uh, Brandon's been busy.

18:12.190 --> 18:12.850
[Sam chuckles]

18:12.930 --> 18:16.300
Honestly, Sam and I just got caught up
in the madness.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.330
You're dating Brandon.
What did you expect?

18:18.400 --> 18:19.900
-Fuck you, Sam.
-Jesus.

18:19.970 --> 18:21.270
Fuck you both.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.760
[chattering]

18:24.970 --> 18:26.270
[Sam] Gabi. Gabi, hey.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.500
Hey, can we talk for a minute?

18:30.840 --> 18:31.870
[Gabi] What's up?

18:31.940 --> 18:33.670
[Sam] Can we talk somewhere more private?

18:34.580 --> 18:35.440
[Gabi] Fine.

18:45.890 --> 18:46.750
[door closes]

18:46.830 --> 18:48.500
[boy] Sammy's going to Dartmouth.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.220
Everybody...

18:50.300 --> 18:51.340
[Sam] Do you wanna sit?

18:51.860 --> 18:52.730
[Gabi] Sure.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.300
[Sam] Gabi, I'm so sorry. Okay?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.470
About everything I said,

18:59.540 --> 19:01.780
and about the fucked-up joke
I made about Brandon.

19:02.810 --> 19:07.280
I just-- I guess I got carried away
in the documentary,

19:07.350 --> 19:11.590
and if I'm being honest,
I guess I was jealous of Brandon.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.990
But you are so much more important to me
than the documentary.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.750
I mean, you're more important to me
than anyone.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.970
I mean...
I mean, not in a crazy way. You know?

19:22.030 --> 19:24.970
Like, I wouldn't spray paint 27 dicks
on cars for you, but...

19:28.400 --> 19:29.260
[Gabi]  You wouldn't?

19:30.340 --> 19:32.340
I mean, what kind of friend are you, Sam?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.630
[Sam chuckles]

19:34.270 --> 19:36.470
[Sam]  Well, I think you should forgive me
for the fans.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.850
Have you read those comments?

19:37.910 --> 19:40.450
All of them are like,
"Oh, Sam and Gabi are so cute.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.750
Sam's adorable, Gabi's all right, too."

19:42.850 --> 19:44.050
[Gabi chuckles]

19:44.320 --> 19:45.390
[Gabi]  For the fans, huh?

19:45.450 --> 19:46.310
[Sam]  Yeah, I mean...

19:46.390 --> 19:48.030
Class of 2016!

19:48.290 --> 19:52.860
[Sam] ...if you wanna disappoint
thousands of people, I get it.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.960
Okay? But I am really sorry.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.330
-[boy] I think you look gorgeous.
-[girl] Stop. Stop it.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.770
Okay. But only for the fans.

20:03.770 --> 20:04.640
I'll take it.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.980
Love you, kiddo.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.540
-[girl] Yeah.
-[boy] Believe it.

20:09.610 --> 20:13.020
[girl] Yeah, we're living the dream.
It's like this is, like, it, you know?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.650
[laughing and shouting indistinctly]

20:17.920 --> 20:19.720
Smile for the camera.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.590
[laughter]

20:22.390 --> 20:23.560
[Dylan grunts]

20:23.620 --> 20:24.920
-Fuck, yeah, dude.
-[Lucas laughs] Whoa, dude.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.390
Oh, way to do this, dude.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.700
Yo, Pete, Pete, Pete.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.760
Caleb's got a projector, man.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.070
Put on  American Vandal .

20:33.530 --> 20:35.660
Oh, shit. We can do that?

20:35.800 --> 20:38.370
-[Brianna] Yeah! Yeah, come on, guys!
-Oh, that's a great idea.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.110
-Oh!
-Shit.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.910
-[Sam] Is everyone ready?
-Ready.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.450
-Play it.
-Yeah.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.980
[Peter on video]  Dylan,
why am I interviewing you?

20:54.790 --> 20:56.860
-[Dylan]  Because everyone thinks I did it.
-[Peter]  Did what?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.360
The dicks.

21:02.390 --> 21:05.090
[news anchor]  KOYF3's Erin Caldwell
is live on the scene...

21:05.360 --> 21:06.830
Yo, this is dope.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.370
Dude, the way you got, like, my-- The--
My face in the shadows of the dicks?

21:12.440 --> 21:13.480
Dude, that's sick.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.380
Everyone thinks I did it.

21:16.810 --> 21:17.780
Like, everyone.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.770
Yo, like, how professional does it look?

21:21.550 --> 21:22.420
It looks sick.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.510
It's like some...
Like some National Geographic thing.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.450
[boy] Yeah, dude.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.890
[Peter]  Even if they had
their story straight, it's not easy

21:28.950 --> 21:31.050
- to trust Dylan and his friends.
-Good shit.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.950
They call themselves the Wayback Boys.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.470
[chuckles]  So fucking dumb.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.460
Those guys are idiots.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.500
[Duncan]  Of course he's gonna say
he didn't do it.

21:39.830 --> 21:40.990
It's called a lie.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.760
[boy 1]  I don't know what they said,
but Dylan did it.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.480
I don't think he was gonna graduate.
Who gives a shit about Dylan Maxwell?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.880
[Gabi]  Guys,
I wouldn't trust anything that Dylan says.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.840
[boy 2]  Dylan's a burnout loser.
Of course he did it.

21:52.940 --> 21:56.110
[boy 3]  Dylan Maxwell is the stupidest kid
I've ever met.

21:56.450 --> 21:57.720
[girl]  He's a fucking idiot.

22:05.460 --> 22:06.130
[Spencer] What's up, man?

22:08.930 --> 22:10.870
What? What's going on?

22:12.930 --> 22:14.660
They don't fucking know me, man.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.830
I barely even know
half these kids' fucking names.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.200
I'm not like they fucking...

22:24.510 --> 22:25.920
I'm not who they think I am.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.050
What do they think you are?

22:30.120 --> 22:33.090
I don't know,
they think I'm some fucking...

22:35.220 --> 22:36.650
dumbass. I'm not...

22:37.760 --> 22:39.930
I'm not, like, book smart...

22:40.930 --> 22:43.730
or fucking street smart or whatever,
but, like...

22:47.070 --> 22:47.940
I'm not dumb.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.470
I'm not fucking dumb.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.040
-Wait, where are you going?
-I don't wanna be on camera, dude.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.780
[all cheering]  Yeah!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.970
[all chanting]  Ming, Ming, Ming...

23:01.110 --> 23:03.510
[hip-hop music playing on video]

23:03.580 --> 23:05.010
[all cheering]

23:07.920 --> 23:08.790
-[boy 1] Ming.
-[boy 2] Ming.

23:09.490 --> 23:10.230
[boy 3] Ming.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.160
[boy 4] Ming.

23:14.630 --> 23:15.500
[boy 5] Oh, shit.

23:16.060 --> 23:16.920
[boy 6] Ming.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
[Sam] Yo, what's going on?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.530
-Excuse me. Watch out.
-[Brandon] Is he breathing?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.640
-[Sam] Excuse me.
-[Brandon] Is he fucking breathing?

23:23.770 --> 23:26.680
-[Sam] Yo, what happened?
-He tried to fucking funnel a six-pack.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.550
-I thought he could handle it.
-[girl] Yo, we need help, you guys.

23:30.010 --> 23:31.650
Who knows CPR? Who knows CPR?

23:31.710 --> 23:33.040
Does anyone know CPR?

23:33.850 --> 23:35.090
Oh, my God. Do you know CPR?

23:36.620 --> 23:38.090
[murmuring]

23:42.520 --> 23:43.580
[coughing]

23:44.120 --> 23:44.990
[Sara] You okay?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.620
-[Christa] Thank you so much.
-[Brandon] Ming.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.530
Love you, man. Don't do that.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.790
[Sam]  Dude, did you see that?

23:50.130 --> 23:51.700
[Peter]  Yeah, man. That was crazy.

23:52.860 --> 23:54.230
[Sam] No, dude, Christa.

23:55.070 --> 23:56.010
[Peter] What about her?

23:56.740 --> 23:58.210
[Sam] She didn't know how to do CPR.

24:01.610 --> 24:02.610
Her alibi.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.140
[Peter]  Where were you
on March 15th, 2016?

24:11.780 --> 24:13.250
I was finishing my CPR training.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.090
[girl] Who knows CPR? Who knows CPR?

24:16.150 --> 24:17.280
Does anyone know CPR?

24:19.590 --> 24:20.290
...theory.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.960
So, this is her alibi,
that she was getting her CPR training,

24:26.160 --> 24:29.160
but she doesn't even know how to do CPR,
so, how did she fake it?

24:29.730 --> 24:32.670
Um... I don't know. Photoshop, maybe?

24:34.310 --> 24:35.650
Let's just call the camp.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.610
[phone line ringing]

24:44.980 --> 24:46.950
[Jim on phone]  Hi, this is Camp Miniwaka.
Jim speaking.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.060
Hi, how are you, Jim?

24:48.120 --> 24:52.030
Um, I'm calling
to confirm a CPR certification.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.170
[Jim]  Okay. Uh, what specifically
are you looking for?

24:56.290 --> 25:00.330
Um, well, it's just that I'm planning
on hiring a student go--

25:00.700 --> 25:06.280
By the name of Christa Carlyle
to be a lifeguard at the pool that I own,

25:06.340 --> 25:07.980
so, I was wondering if I could, um...

25:08.770 --> 25:11.640
If I could just confirm her certification
before I do so.

25:13.710 --> 25:15.880
[Jim]  Uh... Sure.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.280
Say that name to me again.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.860
Christa Carlyle.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.190
C-H-R-I-S--

25:21.250 --> 25:22.280
[Jim]  Yeah, I know Christa.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.650
Um... Yeah.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.800
Yeah, I see her. March 15th, two p.m.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.340
Instructor was Van Delorey.
Yeah, she was certified.

25:35.870 --> 25:38.740
-Wait, who was the instructor?
-Who was the instructor again?

25:38.800 --> 25:39.900
[Jim]  Van Delorey.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.070
[Peter]  You may remember Van Delorey
as the camp counselor

25:45.140 --> 25:47.210
that Sara Pearson had a huge crush on.

25:47.850 --> 25:48.720
She was into me?

25:50.350 --> 25:51.820
I guess I didn't notice.

25:52.980 --> 25:56.080
Until Van started dating Christa Carlyle.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.160
-Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
-[Jim]  No problem.

25:59.220 --> 26:00.090
Have a great day.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.990
Dude, her alibi was her boyfriend.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.690
[chuckles] Motherfucker.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.100
[Peter] So, Christa lied to us.

26:11.700 --> 26:16.000
Wait, what about her broken leg?
I mean, we timed out the time per dick.

26:16.070 --> 26:18.040
There's no way,
you know, you could account

26:18.110 --> 26:19.780
for wobbling with the broken leg.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.010
There's no way you could do the 27 dicks
in the parking lot.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.320
No.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.990
Do you think the broken leg was fake?
Fake cast?

26:27.050 --> 26:28.250
No. No, no, no.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.290
It wasn't fake.

26:30.920 --> 26:31.790
What about this?

26:32.290 --> 26:34.250
What if Christa didn't do the dicks alone?

26:34.430 --> 26:36.130
What if Van was her accomplice?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.200
So, our couples theory.

26:38.260 --> 26:44.230
Our couples theory... wasn't wrong.
We were just looking at the wrong couple.

26:44.300 --> 26:47.930
It wasn't Mackenzie and Dylan,
it was Van and Christa.

26:49.710 --> 26:53.720
Van and Dylan are both 5'10"
Caucasian males with wide builds.

26:54.050 --> 26:57.020
Alex Trimboli claimed
he saw Dylan wearing a hoodie,

26:57.820 --> 27:00.090
but maybe he
didn't get that clear of a look.

27:00.150 --> 27:03.720
I kind of noticed something
out of the corner of my eye, so, I turned.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.200
That's where I saw him.

27:05.490 --> 27:10.160
It's not crazy to think
that Trimboli saw Van Delorey instead.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.800
Van drew the dicks
while Christa erased the footage.

27:12.860 --> 27:13.730
Exactly.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.740
So, we got the access, Morning Show,
spray paint in the can,

27:16.800 --> 27:18.770
alibi, Van Delorey,
which would make sense,

27:18.840 --> 27:21.950
he would cover for her,
because he was doing the dicks with her.

27:22.010 --> 27:25.950
Now, the only thing that we're missing now
is the motive. Why? Why would she do this?

27:27.050 --> 27:30.320
Was it some...? I don't know,
some social cause or protest or something?

27:30.380 --> 27:32.110
-She's always doing that.
-[Sam]  Hold on.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.750
It's Christa Carlyle we're talking about,
our student body president.

27:36.320 --> 27:40.520
There's no way she would risk her career,
her college applications, her future,

27:40.790 --> 27:43.190
-for some social cause.
-It would have to be personal.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.840
[Peter]  What vendetta
could Christa Carlyle have had?

27:47.370 --> 27:51.010
She's a straight-A student,
beloved within the Hanover High community.

27:51.540 --> 27:54.210
So, do we go back
and look at all 27 cars that were hit

27:54.270 --> 27:57.340
-and each of the teachers?
-No, start with the three. The splatter.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.850
-[Sam] The Splatter Three?
-[Peter] Yeah.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.020
There were three cars with splatter,

28:01.510 --> 28:04.180
three faculty members
that could have been hit first.

28:04.920 --> 28:08.260
And if you recall,
Christa has a history with one of them.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.830
Coach, he was pissed.

28:10.990 --> 28:15.130
This is proof that religious equality
is more important than football.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.090
She's a protester.
She's always coming up with something

28:19.160 --> 28:22.100
to stand up for, which is cool.
It's cool. I just, uh...

28:22.170 --> 28:23.310
I wish Christa hadn't done it

28:23.370 --> 28:28.340
right in the middle of my pep rally,
but... hey, good for them. Happy New Year.

28:28.970 --> 28:31.000
[Peter]  Rafferty never had Christa
as a student.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.010
Since Christa was captain
of the varsity soccer team,

28:34.180 --> 28:35.850
she didn't need to take phys ed.

28:37.050 --> 28:40.960
Christa and Rafferty did meet in the fall,
when she tried out for the football team.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.380
Remember this clip?

28:42.520 --> 28:44.250
-[boy 1] Yeah! Yeah!
-[boy 2] Get her down!

28:44.320 --> 28:45.420
[all cheering]

28:46.390 --> 28:48.150
[Peter]  Christa was trying out for kicker,

28:48.390 --> 28:50.990
so, there's no reason
to put her in a hitting drill.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.560
Did Rafferty do it
to spite her for the protest?

28:55.430 --> 28:59.000
The full video shows him walking up
to Christa as she lies on the ground.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.270
Right there.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.080
What does he say to her?

29:02.840 --> 29:04.940
Maybe it's just the coach talking
to a player.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.470
Or maybe he said something
that went too far.

29:09.110 --> 29:12.380
[Sam] Do you think what he said could be
inappropriate conduct with a student?

29:14.450 --> 29:16.520
-The complaint file.
-[Peter] Yeah.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.290
And it was...

29:19.860 --> 29:22.100
It was issued on the same day as tryouts.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.000
I still think
that Mackenzie trashed his office,

29:25.060 --> 29:27.230
but that had nothing to do
with the complaint.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.440
I think that the complaint came
from Christa.

29:30.030 --> 29:30.900
What do you think?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.410
And look when it was marked resolved.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.480
Yeah, five days before the vandalism.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.510
[Peter]  The complaint was filed
the day of tryouts.

29:41.050 --> 29:43.490
If Rafferty said something terrible
to Christa,

29:44.080 --> 29:47.880
the school waited over six months
before sweeping it under the rug,

29:48.390 --> 29:51.560
when, on March 10th,
they marked the complaint "resolved,"

29:52.120 --> 29:55.420
leaving us
with just a vague five-word description:

29:56.230 --> 29:58.900
"Inappropriate conduct with a student."

30:00.270 --> 30:04.070
The very next day,
instead of reprimanding Coach Rafferty,

30:04.300 --> 30:07.330
the school awarded him
with Teacher of the Year.

30:08.010 --> 30:09.550
It doesn't feel like a coincidence

30:09.610 --> 30:12.080
that the vandalism happened
just four days later.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.410
I reached out to Christa a few times
for an interview.

30:16.950 --> 30:19.090
I told her I just wanted
to ask each member

30:19.150 --> 30:22.450
of the Morning Show Nine
a few general follow-up questions.

30:23.150 --> 30:26.950
But she ignored me,
until finally agreeing to talk.

30:27.930 --> 30:30.200
The day after graduation.

30:30.430 --> 30:34.240
So, you're known for doing a lot
of political protests and demonstrations.

30:34.630 --> 30:36.700
Like when you spoke out
for gender equality

30:37.070 --> 30:38.610
by trying out for the football team.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.430
That wasn't a demonstration.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.410
No?

30:42.610 --> 30:44.180
No, I was all-state for soccer,

30:44.240 --> 30:46.540
and I wanted to be the kicker
for the football team.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.320
I didn't know that.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.610
Were you frustrated
when you didn't make the team?

30:52.150 --> 30:53.180
I did make the team.

30:54.590 --> 30:55.730
Then why didn't you play?

30:56.390 --> 30:58.230
I decided not to join after the fact.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.290
Why?

31:02.630 --> 31:04.270
I don't really wanna get into it.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.430
Of course.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.010
Um, can I show you something?

31:09.330 --> 31:10.330
-Yeah.
-Cool.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.410
So, Sam came across these videos.

31:13.470 --> 31:17.970
I don't know how he got them,
but, um, it was from tryouts.

31:18.380 --> 31:19.980
And right here...

31:21.310 --> 31:25.140
Looks like you get hit pretty hard,
right there.

31:28.490 --> 31:31.260
-Yeah. That was uncalled for.
-Mm-hm.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.690
I mean, I was trying out for kicker,
not receiver.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.490
And it's no telling
that Coach Rafferty was upset

31:37.560 --> 31:39.490
after that whole pep rally walkout thing.

31:39.730 --> 31:42.200
So, do you think that hit
could've been on purpose?

31:42.630 --> 31:43.500
I don't know.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.070
Did he say something to you
after you got hit?

31:49.410 --> 31:51.080
Right here, specifically?

31:54.210 --> 31:55.480
[Christa]  I don't wanna repeat it.

31:57.220 --> 31:58.490
Did you tell anyone about it?

31:59.420 --> 32:02.130
Look, Peter, he's an asshole.
What do you want me to say?

32:04.460 --> 32:05.600
Can I show you something?

32:08.190 --> 32:11.290
Right here, if you could draw
your attention to the first page.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.410
Did you make this complaint
on the day of the tryouts?

32:22.570 --> 32:25.740
The complaint was marked "resolved,"
but was it?

32:27.180 --> 32:28.080
According to them.

32:31.250 --> 32:35.290
And March 10th,
that was a big week for Coach Rafferty.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.780
He was honored with Teacher of the Year.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.320
How did that make you feel?

32:47.530 --> 32:51.060
-Where were you at the time of vandalism?
-Okay, I'm not doing this.

32:51.140 --> 32:53.280
Christa,
why did you wait until after graduation

32:53.340 --> 32:54.340
to do this interview?

32:54.410 --> 32:55.280
Why?

32:56.740 --> 32:58.340
Christa, did you draw the dicks?

32:58.810 --> 32:59.670
No.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.810
[Peter]  I have mixed feelings
about the Christa theory.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.420
-Religious equality is more important...
-[Peter]  On one hand, it all adds up:

33:09.720 --> 33:12.120
The combative relationship
with Coach Rafferty,

33:12.490 --> 33:15.250
the timing of Rafferty's
Teacher of the Year award,

33:16.260 --> 33:18.720
the resolution of Christa's complaint.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.860
- And the Free Dylan T-shirts.
-Here.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.360
[Peter]  The GoFundMe campaign.

33:22.730 --> 33:25.470
Were those protests of passion
for Christa,

33:25.540 --> 33:28.180
or an attempt
to clear her guilty conscience?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.280
[Christa]  I drew the dicks.

33:29.410 --> 33:32.280
[Peter]  On the other hand,
all of this is circumstantial.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.480
So, I have my best guess,
but so did the school board.

33:37.220 --> 33:40.360
They expelled Dylan Maxwell
without hard evidence.

33:40.850 --> 33:45.180
We now know, with complete certainty,
that he's innocent,

33:45.860 --> 33:48.800
that the system convicted him
of a crime he didn't commit.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.590
So, while I do owe you
my honest, best theory...

33:53.230 --> 33:55.230
I'm hesitant to speak with any certainty.

33:55.730 --> 33:59.900
Because I've seen the way an accusation
can ruin someone's life.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.150
[Spencer on voicemail]
Yo, Pete, listen, it's Spencer.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.610
I don't know if you heard,
but Dylan got arrested.

34:14.889 --> 34:17.860
They, like, came to his house last night
when he was sleeping,

34:17.920 --> 34:19.420
put him in handcuffs and shit.

34:20.389 --> 34:22.590
It's fucked, man.
I think they're setting him up.

34:23.630 --> 34:26.300
[Peter]  They wouldn't let me speak to him
at the police station,

34:26.360 --> 34:28.389
but his mother filled me in
on the details.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.170
Ms. Shapiro's house was vandalized.

34:35.570 --> 34:38.270
Dylan Maxwell was the only suspect.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.679
[Dylan] Shapiro just wants
to see me get fucked, man.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.380
[chuckles] She's trying to pin
some shit on me again.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.429
[Peter] I mean,
you had nothing to do with it.

34:50.489 --> 34:55.300
No. Dude, someone
spray-painted a dick on her driveway.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.290
No ball hairs.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.340
Couldn't have been me.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.800
She's fucking pinning me again, dude.

35:13.310 --> 35:13.970
What?

35:16.210 --> 35:18.740
You know that Ms. Shapiro's neighbor
has security cameras?

35:25.490 --> 35:26.560
[Dylan sighs]

35:27.260 --> 35:27.930
Yeah.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.260
[Peter]  How could you do it, man?

35:59.320 --> 36:00.020
I didn't do it.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.900
Dylan, you were exonerated.

36:03.690 --> 36:06.690
You were innocent.
You were back in school.

36:08.670 --> 36:10.440
How could you throw all of that away?

36:12.270 --> 36:13.530
Throw what away?

36:17.910 --> 36:19.380
I didn't get into Boulder.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.010
Mac's gone.

36:29.820 --> 36:34.050
Everyone thinks
I'm just some fucking... idiot stoner kid,

36:34.330 --> 36:35.670
who's not going anywhere.

36:41.370 --> 36:42.410
Shapiro's right.

36:45.840 --> 36:46.710
So...

36:48.640 --> 36:49.610
What the fuck?

36:52.980 --> 36:54.850
If that's what everyone thinks, then...

36:58.820 --> 37:00.360
maybe that's just who I am.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.320
That's not true.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.830
I'm the bad guy.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.530
I'm the fuckup.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.410
[Peter]  Consider for a moment
the type of person

37:29.480 --> 37:32.380
who would spray-paint dicks on cars
in the staff parking lot.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.610
What do they look like?

37:35.550 --> 37:36.720
Who do they hang out with?

37:37.560 --> 37:39.060
Where do they sit in the cafeteria?

37:39.790 --> 37:41.390
What kind of grades do they get?

37:42.030 --> 37:43.500
Is this who you're imagining?

37:44.430 --> 37:45.100
Probably not.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.070
How about him?

37:47.570 --> 37:48.440
Or her?

37:48.970 --> 37:49.840
Or him?

37:50.600 --> 37:53.130
I set out to examine the case
against Dylan Maxwell,

37:53.940 --> 37:57.710
to find out whether or not he was guilty
of the vandalism on March 15th.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.870
I helped prove,
without a shadow of a doubt,

38:01.150 --> 38:02.950
that Dylan Maxwell was innocent.

38:03.610 --> 38:07.080
He was wrongfully expelled
on his reputation alone.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.990
To be fair, it's a reputation he's earned.

38:10.820 --> 38:15.090
Detentions, suspensions,
countless clashes with authority.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.970
According to the school board,
"Dylan is beyond rehabilitation."

38:20.660 --> 38:22.530
A short declarative statement.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.500
I know for a fact
that this administration has exhausted

38:25.570 --> 38:28.010
all other disciplinary options with Dylan.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.180
[Peter]  How long do you think
the school board has felt that way?

38:31.440 --> 38:32.840
Was that box checked on day one?

38:33.880 --> 38:39.790
Was that stamp of deficiency reinforced,
grade after grade, class after class?

38:40.020 --> 38:41.720
Over and over again?

38:42.690 --> 38:46.560
After four years,
if enough people see you a certain way,

38:47.790 --> 38:49.620
do you start to believe they're right?

38:50.030 --> 38:51.070
I'm the bad guy.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.960
[Peter]  Who do you think this person is?

38:54.730 --> 38:57.830
Whatever you're thinking,
you're probably wrong.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.440
Good.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.670
Bad.

39:00.740 --> 39:01.940
Innocent.

39:02.010 --> 39:03.010
Guilty.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.170
It's so easy to check a box.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.140
Teachers do it, students do it.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.050
I'm guilty of it myself.

39:10.850 --> 39:13.690
High school is only four years
of your life.

39:13.750 --> 39:17.050
It's a span of time
with more questions than answers.

39:17.690 --> 39:20.730
How can anyone allow four years
to define them?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.200
How can anyone pretend
that four years is long enough

39:24.460 --> 39:26.230
to know what type of person they are?

39:26.500 --> 39:29.040
Uh, please, state your name
and who you are.

39:29.830 --> 39:33.000
My name is Dylan Maxwell, and I'm...

39:36.070 --> 39:38.000
-[Peter] All right.
-I mean, I don't know, dude.

39:38.080 --> 39:41.520
I'm just Dylan. What do you mean,
"Who am I?" That's a stupid question.

39:41.650 --> 39:44.090
[Peter]  He's right.
That is a stupid question.
