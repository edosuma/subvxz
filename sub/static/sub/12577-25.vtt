00:31.514 --> 00:33.099
Listen, guys,
I sent the cards out

00:33.099 --> 00:34.601
about a month ago

00:34.601 --> 00:36.603
for our 20th
wedding anniversary barbecue.

00:36.603 --> 00:37.771
And well,

00:37.771 --> 00:40.273
peggy is kind of a stickler
for those things.

00:40.273 --> 00:43.276
So I'm gonna need
your r.s.v.p.s.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.394
yep.

00:44.394 --> 00:45.361
yep.

00:45.361 --> 00:46.362
Mmm-hmm.

00:46.863 --> 00:48.231
All right, then.
So it's official.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.700
Are you gonna
give her china, hank?

00:50.700 --> 00:53.203
20th anniversary's china.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.205
My marriage
only made it to wood.

00:55.205 --> 00:57.123
No, but after the party,

00:57.123 --> 00:59.125
luanne's going
camping with friends,

00:59.125 --> 01:01.127
and bobby's
going to my dad's.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.128
That means
peggy and I

01:02.128 --> 01:04.297
will have the whole
weekend to ourselves.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.584
So i, uh, won't be
in the alley as much.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.170
20 years.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.255
If your marriage
were a murderer,

01:12.255 --> 01:14.257
it'd probably
be out by now.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.147
[phone ringing]

01:21.147 --> 01:22.148
hmm.

01:23.316 --> 01:26.820
hello. Oh, hi, tracy.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.823
My aunt is so happy
i'm going camping with you.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.992
She and uncle hank
are gonna get so busy.

01:33.993 --> 01:35.495
What?

01:35.495 --> 01:38.698
Do they expect
the forest fire
to last the whole weekend?

01:39.249 --> 01:40.250
[gasping]

01:40.250 --> 01:41.251
bye.

01:41.251 --> 01:43.369
is everything ok,
honey?

01:43.369 --> 01:45.004
Mmm-hmm, oh, yeah,

01:45.004 --> 01:48.041
yeah, they just,
uh, phoned to, um,

01:48.041 --> 01:51.044
remind me to, uh,
bring an extra can of gravy.

01:51.044 --> 01:51.845
[giggles]

01:53.263 --> 01:54.714
yo.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.017
[connie and joseph laughing]

01:58.351 --> 02:00.854
bobby, my camping trip's
been canceled,

02:00.854 --> 02:04.858
and the shelter says
I have to be battered
to stay there.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.860
So can I go
with you to cotton's?

02:06.860 --> 02:09.863
No way. This is
my last chance for grandpa

02:09.863 --> 02:12.649
to spoil me
before the baby's born.

02:12.649 --> 02:15.952
You stay away from him.
He's mine.

02:15.952 --> 02:17.954
He doesn't even
know your name.

02:17.954 --> 02:20.039
Yes, he does.
I'm missy melons.

02:20.039 --> 02:22.542
Remember,
these baby clothes
are just on loan

02:22.542 --> 02:25.044
until I get pregnant
with my 2nd child.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.045
.
Maybe this weekend

02:26.546 --> 02:28.381
it is so unfair that
your eggs are rotten.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.384
Well, for your information
, my eggs are just fine.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.887
It's hank's narrow urethra
that's the problem.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.472
Although no one's to blame.
No, I'm just stating a fact.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.057
[people chattering]

02:38.558 --> 02:40.643
oh, hey! Hey!

02:40.643 --> 02:44.814
I would like to make a toast
to hank and peggy hill-billy.

02:44.814 --> 02:47.100
Ha! They have been
married 20 years.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.903
That a long time.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.272
Minh and I only
been married 13 years.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.525
But, uh, it's quality,
not quantity, that matter.

02:56.025 --> 02:57.944
Last year
on our anniversary,

02:57.944 --> 03:01.698
minh and I bungee jump
off rock 74 bridge.

03:03.199 --> 03:05.034
.
I love you,
minh souphanousinphone

03:05.034 --> 03:07.871
I love you,
kahn souphanousinphone.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.292
[exclaiming]

03:12.792 --> 03:14.294
[both grunting]

03:22.218 --> 03:25.688
oh! You guys didn't
have to do this.

03:25.688 --> 03:27.557
I know,
but nancy said we did.

03:28.057 --> 03:29.058
[dale chuckling]

03:29.058 --> 03:32.228
they're canes.
Read the card.

03:32.729 --> 03:33.730
ok.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.232
"for when the hills
are over the hill."

03:36.232 --> 03:37.734
[dale chuckling]

03:37.734 --> 03:40.370
get it?
Your last name's hill.

03:40.370 --> 03:41.871
Mmm-hmm.

03:41.871 --> 03:43.990
There's not much
to get, is there?

03:43.990 --> 03:45.825
[all chattering]

03:45.825 --> 03:48.328
ok, everybody,
let's settle down.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.830
Now, this is not
my award-winning

03:50.830 --> 03:52.832
the history of propane
slide show,

03:53.333 --> 03:54.834
but it's the next best thing:

03:54.834 --> 03:57.170
my marriage
to Mrs. Peggy hill.

03:57.587 --> 04:01.090
I call it 20 years
of outstanding service.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.091
Oh, hank.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.062
??[music playing]

04:06.062 --> 04:08.064
here we see the early years

04:08.064 --> 04:10.650
when our first home
was an efficiency apartment.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.603
Although it would have been
more efficient

04:13.603 --> 04:16.406
if it was
heated with propane.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.690
(peggy)
our bed was our only
piece of furniture,

04:19.075 --> 04:20.576
and it was all
we needed.

04:20.576 --> 04:23.746
Yep, 'cause it
converted into a couch.

04:23.746 --> 04:26.749
Bobby's head pretty much
regained its shape

04:26.749 --> 04:29.585
and peggy pretty much
regained her shape, too.

04:29.585 --> 04:30.954
[tittering]

04:30.954 --> 04:33.923
seriously, that was the day
bobby was born.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.342
[reel clicking]

04:37.844 --> 04:40.179
(hank)
and here's peggy and me
whooping it up

04:40.179 --> 04:42.382
at the young gasser's ball.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.383
[moaning]

04:43.383 --> 04:45.685
slide show longer
than their marriage.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.053
[all laughing]

04:47.053 --> 04:50.189
(hank)
is this hank and peggy hill
20 years from now?

04:50.690 --> 04:53.977
I hope so,
because I wouldn't
want it any other way.

04:53.977 --> 04:57.897
Here's to 20 more years
of outstanding service.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.399
[dale cheering]

05:01.067 --> 05:04.570
well, I have
summarized our marriage
in a different fashion

05:04.570 --> 05:07.073
that I hope you will
find no less pleasing.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.074
I begin.

05:08.074 --> 05:11.077
"we planted our seed
a long time ago

05:11.077 --> 05:14.580
"and for 20 years
we've watched it grow

05:14.580 --> 05:17.583
"into a beautiful garden
of give-and-take

05:17.583 --> 05:20.386
"and now it's time
to cut the cake

05:20.386 --> 05:23.723
"but before we do,
i'd like to say

05:23.723 --> 05:24.640
[didi yelps]

05:26.259 --> 05:29.929
"i would like to say
i'm so glad you're here today

05:29.929 --> 05:31.347
[didi yelps]
to share with us--"

05:31.347 --> 05:33.149
the baby kicked my insides.

05:34.517 --> 05:35.601
[moans]

05:35.601 --> 05:38.104
it puts on quite a sho
w when it gets goin'.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.274
Didi, show 'em
your gas tank.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.775
[groaning]

05:42.775 --> 05:44.277
(connie)
wow!

05:44.277 --> 05:45.912
(cotton)
this one's busting
to get out.

05:45.912 --> 05:49.532
Not like hank.
Never moved once
while he was in there.

05:49.532 --> 05:51.784
Not even born,
and he already give up.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.753
[all chattering]

05:56.756 --> 05:58.758
well, I'm leaving
for the weekend.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.259
Got my gravy.

06:03.713 --> 06:05.214
Ok, where to?

06:05.214 --> 06:06.716
Anywhere but here.

06:06.716 --> 06:09.719
Oh, not the dressbarn.
I bounced a check.

06:09.719 --> 06:12.188
Or the nail salon,
for the same reason.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.141
k
Bye. Take
a good loo

06:15.141 --> 06:17.143
because the next time
you see me,

06:17.143 --> 06:18.644
.
i'll be spoiled rotten

06:19.145 --> 06:20.146
all right.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.784
Hey, guys,
just letting you know

06:25.284 --> 06:27.320
if you do serve
ice cream for dinner,

06:27.320 --> 06:28.321
I won't tell.

06:28.321 --> 06:31.124
Bobby, this ain't no
baskin-robbins vacation.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.409
Didi's with child.
She's useless.

06:33.910 --> 06:36.796
Now, you can start
by cleanin'
the back of my ears.

06:37.296 --> 06:38.798
[groaning]

06:39.298 --> 06:40.633
[grunts]

06:40.633 --> 06:41.634
[hank sighing]

06:42.135 --> 06:43.503
(hank)
well, that was great.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.639
We ran out of potato salad
and meat at the same time.

06:46.639 --> 06:47.640
Perfect.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.810
I thought my slide show
went over pretty big.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.312
All in all,
a pretty good day.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.847
Happy anniversary, peggy.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.733
Uh, don't wake me up
when you come in.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.102
[sobbing]

07:01.487 --> 07:03.573
look, if you're worried
about the mess,

07:03.573 --> 07:05.324
you can clean it up later.

07:05.324 --> 07:06.826
[crying]

07:12.448 --> 07:13.950
if you're worried
about bobby,

07:13.950 --> 07:15.952
he's gonna be fine
at cotton's.

07:15.952 --> 07:17.453
It's just a weekend.

07:17.453 --> 07:18.955
I had to survive
a whole childhood.

07:19.455 --> 07:20.957
Hank, we're old.

07:21.457 --> 07:24.460
Oh, peggy, that
was just a joke slide.

07:24.961 --> 07:27.463
Although,
the fotomat did make you
look older than me.

07:27.463 --> 07:30.466
No, it's not
the joke slide, hank.

07:30.967 --> 07:33.469
The joke slide
was funny, ok?

07:33.469 --> 07:34.971
It's all the other slides.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.473
I saw a young
married couple,

07:37.473 --> 07:39.475
and I did not
recognize them.

07:39.475 --> 07:42.145
I mean, hank,
we look like strangers.

07:42.145 --> 07:44.730
Strangers who stole
our glasses and our hair.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.066
Well, I assure you
it was us.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.568
Whatever happened
to that young couple

07:49.068 --> 07:51.070
with their dreams
of inventing a steak sauce

07:51.070 --> 07:52.071
and getting rich

07:52.071 --> 07:53.906
or--or taking a train
to alaska?

07:54.373 --> 07:56.375
That couple just
grew up and realized

07:56.375 --> 07:58.377
that there was
too much competition

07:58.377 --> 08:00.379
among existing
steak sauces.

08:00.379 --> 08:04.217
We did ourselves a favor
by abandoning those dreams,
peggy.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.551
Well, maybe
we should just start

08:05.551 --> 08:07.553
using those canes
that dale gave us

08:08.054 --> 08:10.056
and we could bash ourselve
s over the heads

08:10.056 --> 08:12.058
and be done with it.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.559
Look, peggy,

08:13.559 --> 08:15.561
we've both been
looking forward
to this weekend.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.063
The kids are
out of the house,

08:17.063 --> 08:19.065
we've rented
an r-rated movie.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.066
Uh-huh.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.018
We'll fry up some jiffy pop.

08:22.018 --> 08:23.519
Uh-huh.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.571
What movie did you rent?

08:26.072 --> 08:27.073
Platoon.

08:29.492 --> 08:30.993
[panting]

08:33.246 --> 08:34.914
[growling]

08:34.914 --> 08:36.414
ladybird.

08:36.414 --> 08:39.118
It's me, luanne.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.453
[growling]

08:41.419 --> 08:42.922
[whimpers]

08:43.422 --> 08:45.258
oh.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.376
here you go, girl. Gravy.

08:49.378 --> 08:50.880
Good girl. Yeah.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.848
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:52.848 --> 08:53.849
yes!

08:55.218 --> 08:57.220
[luanne yelps]

08:57.220 --> 08:59.555
(cotton)
come on, bobby
. In here.

08:59.555 --> 09:01.557
This is the baby's room.

09:01.557 --> 09:03.059
Decorated it myself.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.113
You see this picture?

09:07.113 --> 09:11.367
That's me before
I had my shins blown off.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.152
What's that
you're holding?

09:13.152 --> 09:15.071
Head of a nazi.

09:15.071 --> 09:18.291
.
Oh, no,
it's a canteen

09:19.792 --> 09:22.044
hey, jim, I'm looking
for a nice restaurant

09:22.044 --> 09:24.413
to take my wife to
for our anniversary.

09:24.413 --> 09:26.415
All right, let's see.

09:26.415 --> 09:28.918
Here's that
revolving restaurant
in mcmaynerbury.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.386
Got a "7" in the auto guide.

09:30.386 --> 09:32.588
.
A "7." wow

09:32.588 --> 09:34.173
well, I'll get
my highlighter

09:34.173 --> 09:35.925
and I'll throw together
a triptik for you.

09:36.259 --> 09:38.261
Uh, you want the direct route
or the scenic?

09:38.261 --> 09:40.680
Most folks tell me
the extra 5 minutes
is worth it.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.149
Uh, direct.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.434
??[music playing]

09:45.935 --> 09:46.936
what do you know?

09:46.936 --> 09:48.938
You can see
all of mcmaynerbury.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.439
Huh. There's
that auto mall

09:50.439 --> 09:51.824
they're always
bragging about.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.326
And in about
30 minutes

09:53.826 --> 09:55.661
we will be
facing the sunset.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.699
Hi, can I get you folks
anything to drink?

09:59.699 --> 10:02.501
Oh, you know,
I've never tried
a singapore sling.

10:02.501 --> 10:05.004
