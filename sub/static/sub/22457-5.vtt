00:02.340 --> 00:06.299
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:09.332
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.380 --> 00:13.896
<i>Cos I'm in hell.</i>

00:18.660 --> 00:20.537
'Urgh! More data entry tonight.

00:20.580 --> 00:23.731
'I guess the only good thing
is that my life is so boring

00:23.780 --> 00:25.771
'it feels like it might go on forever.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.572
'Maybe I'll put on Big Bond Themes

00:27.620 --> 00:29.770
'and pretend I'm data entering for Ml6.'

00:29.820 --> 00:33.335
- Hi, honey, you're home!
- Hi, Jez.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.019
You know how depressed
you are about getting married?

00:36.060 --> 00:38.016
What? Let's not drag that up now.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.290
I'm looking forward to it, that's the line.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.296
It's possible I might find a way out.

00:42.340 --> 00:45.491
It's in four weeks, Mark.
It's going to happen.

00:45.540 --> 00:49.215
Look, no matter how unpalatable
it may be, the fact is

00:49.260 --> 00:52.536
I'm your best friend and I know you
don't wanna hear it, but I love you.

00:52.580 --> 00:56.129
And in your own dried up,
desiccated, weird

00:56.180 --> 00:58.011
and unfriendly way, you love me too.

00:58.060 --> 01:01.211
So I've got together my last scraps
of cash to give you

01:01.260 --> 01:03.410
the stag weekend of your dreams!

01:03.460 --> 01:05.257
- Really?
- Yes.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.973
I've booked us a canal boat
near an Iron Age area.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.738
You can go and look at the Iron Age,

01:09.780 --> 01:12.499
or whatever it is you do,
and I'll make us some steaks.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.974
I've sent off for a chess set
and I'll learn how to play,

01:15.020 --> 01:18.092
but if I'm not good enough
then there's a computer setting.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.619
Or I'll be pretending to play

01:19.660 --> 01:22.220
but really you'll be playing
the computer. OK?

01:22.260 --> 01:25.138
Oh, well, that's... nice. That...

01:25.180 --> 01:28.377
That actually sounds fun! Unfortunately,

01:28.420 --> 01:31.378
as I said, I think I might not
be getting married after all.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.978
- Oh?
- Yeah.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.693
Sophie's twigged something's not right
and she's arranged for us

01:35.740 --> 01:37.810
to see a relationship counsellor.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.010
Right. And yet you seem
excited because?

01:40.060 --> 01:42.893
It's all gonna come out!
The whole disgusting mess!

01:42.940 --> 01:45.693
She'll wheedle it all out!
It'll take hours to break me down,

01:45.740 --> 01:49.130
but then it'll all spill out and Sophie
won't be able to shout at me

01:49.180 --> 01:52.297
as there'll be a professional there.
And none of it's even my fault!

01:52.340 --> 01:54.615
It's all my so-called subconscious!

01:57.180 --> 01:59.648
I want you both to relax.
This is just a safe place

01:59.700 --> 02:02.931
where I'm going to listen to
whatever you have to say.

02:02.980 --> 02:06.768
'Oh, yeah, here we are, the field
of screams, the torture chamber,

02:06.820 --> 02:08.299
'the emotional dungeon.'

02:08.340 --> 02:11.412
You've got this wedding coming up.
How are you both feeling?

02:11.460 --> 02:17.057
'Oh, she is good. Here it comes.
Let it all flood out just gently.'

02:17.100 --> 02:19.091
Mark?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.813
Me? Oh, I'm-I'm-I'm feeling...

02:21.860 --> 02:23.452
pr-pretty positive.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.731
Obviously there's some tiny doubts.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.099
'Don't overdo it.'

02:28.140 --> 02:29.732
Mainly about the catering.

02:29.780 --> 02:33.136
Well, that seems perfectly normal.
Sophie, how about you?

02:33.180 --> 02:37.458
Well, I just wish I felt that comfortable.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.288
'Hold on.
Is that it? Is that my go finished?

02:41.340 --> 02:44.776
'Did she just believe what I said?
What kind of counselling is that?!

02:44.820 --> 02:47.015
'She didn't wheedle
anything out of me!

02:47.060 --> 02:51.019
'How can I blow my emotional beans
if she doesn't at least give me a wheedle? '

02:51.060 --> 02:53.620
Plus, obviously, Sophie mentioned
on the phone

02:53.660 --> 02:56.413
about the sexual problems
in your relationship.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.449
Sorry?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.219
The sexual problems in your relationship.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.820
Oh! Right. Are there?

03:02.860 --> 03:07.490
Well, I just feel, I don't know, unfulfilled.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.338
- Unfilled?
- Unfulfilled.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.857
Right. Well, l-l-I mean...

03:15.900 --> 03:18.095
I suppose I thought that...

03:18.140 --> 03:22.372
maybe Sophie might be one of
those women who...

03:22.420 --> 03:25.492
who find it difficult
or-or-or even impossible

03:25.540 --> 03:28.850
- to attain... to-to achieve...
- No, I'm definitely not one of those.

03:28.900 --> 03:29.889
Right.

03:29.940 --> 03:34.889
What would you say if you felt
that you weren't going to be judged?

03:34.940 --> 03:37.215
I'd say...

03:37.260 --> 03:38.409
I'd say, um...

03:38.460 --> 03:40.098
'This isn't gonna be good.'

03:40.140 --> 03:44.656
<i>...often, Mark, you ejaculate...</i>

03:44.700 --> 03:46.816
quite a long time

03:46.860 --> 03:52.617
before I've had time to feel like
I've started to enjoy our sex.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.259
Uh-huh.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.530
Thanks for that, Soph.

03:59.580 --> 04:02.890
Great. Well, I'll make a note of that.

04:02.940 --> 04:05.659
Well, th-this has been great, just a great...

04:05.700 --> 04:07.452
time.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.934
Mark, it's all right,
we've got 45 minutes yet.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.813
Really? 45 minutes.

04:12.860 --> 04:17.331
'Great! I'll be spending Â£1 a minute
to hear how shit I am at sex!

04:17.380 --> 04:19.052
'Now, that's value for money! '

04:23.380 --> 04:25.610
So good to just get away.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.935
Oh, yeah. The stag aquatic.

04:27.980 --> 04:30.813
So come on, let's max out
the engine a bit. Tear it up.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.896
Actually, this is almost top speed.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.168
What if we hit trouble?

04:34.220 --> 04:37.292
I don't think we'll hit trouble
on the Shropshire Union Canal.

04:37.340 --> 04:40.059
Right, but this is just it?
This is totally it?

04:40.100 --> 04:42.330
There's not gonna be
any waves or mad shit?

04:42.380 --> 04:44.610
- No.
- Can I water ski off the back?

04:44.660 --> 04:46.218
You're very welcome to try.

04:46.260 --> 04:50.014
Jesus! Well, let's stop here, then,
and go for a drink.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.335
Jez, it's ten in the morning!

04:52.380 --> 04:55.816
What else are we gonna do?
Freeze our nuts off talking to each other?

04:55.860 --> 04:57.691
What the hell are we gonna talk about?

04:57.740 --> 05:00.732
I dunno! Stuff! Banter. Chat.

05:00.780 --> 05:02.896
Isn't that what you had in mind
when you organised this thing?

05:02.940 --> 05:04.532
Sure. Yeah.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.059
S'pose.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.450
So how do you feel
now the wedding's back on track?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.615
Not that.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.378
Right, not that! Well, what then?

05:13.420 --> 05:15.615
I can't think of anything to say. You start.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.055
Hey, is that a kingfisher?

05:21.100 --> 05:22.772
For God's sake! If we're gonna talk,

05:22.820 --> 05:25.334
let's talk about something proper, like films.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.610
(Mark) 'Urgh, films.
Another hour of my life gone

05:27.660 --> 05:30.299
'trying to explain to him
what The Matrix is.'

05:30.340 --> 05:33.059
(Jez) 'This weekend is gonna be
one massive dry hump.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.330
'Maybe the pressure
will build to the point

05:35.380 --> 05:37.575
'where we actually try
to fuck each other.'

05:41.660 --> 05:44.732
Jeremy, you promised you'd play
with apparent enthusiasm.

05:44.780 --> 05:47.852
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.972
You can so tell this game
is over a thousand years old.

05:51.020 --> 05:54.012
Yes, it's very sophisticated.
It's your move.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.051
- I don't wanna play any more.
- Because I'm winning?

05:56.100 --> 05:59.137
No, not because you're win...
I don't even know who's winning!

06:03.820 --> 06:07.290
Here, Mark, I tell you what,
you piss in this bottle, I'll drink it.

06:07.340 --> 06:09.217
What? What the hell for?

06:09.260 --> 06:10.488
For a laugh! It's the stag!

06:10.540 --> 06:13.612
No, Jez. If you drank my piss
I'd feel violated.

06:13.660 --> 06:15.491
Oh, that is great.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.656
You wouldn't even let me
drink your piss.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.009
I'm not trying to kiss you.
It's liquid waste.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.459
I'm sorry, but no.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.650
You wouldn't let me drink your piss?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.418
Why would you even want
to drink my piss?!

06:25.460 --> 06:26.495
For a laugh!

06:26.540 --> 06:28.019
What the hell made you think of that?

06:28.060 --> 06:30.574
I'm just bored, OK!

06:30.620 --> 06:32.178
I'd let you drink my piss.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.619
Oh, thank you very much.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.378
Oh, come on, let's get out of here.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.888
Let's go and get you
some sweet punani action.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.771
I don't want sweet punani action.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.254
I wanna take your bishop
and grind you down.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.770
Here, look, take it. And the horsey.
Come on, man!

06:45.820 --> 06:47.651
Couple of pints, couple of hotties.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.578
Yeah? Come on, tiger, let's roar!

06:50.620 --> 06:53.453
'Oh, God! I wish I lived with
the chess computer.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.173
'The chess computer
wouldn't make me do things.'

06:57.860 --> 07:01.011
I'm stagging you.
I'm stagging you by the back door.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.971
<i>This is your stag.</i>

07:03.020 --> 07:06.569
I don't want a hangover, Jeremy.
I want to be almost asleep by 11.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.134
Two yards of ale, please. It's his stag.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.330
Yards. Really?

07:11.380 --> 07:14.452
Hello. Check it out, Mark.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.572
Oh. Yeah. They're eating.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.771
- Let's go and say hello.
- No, let's definitely not.

07:20.820 --> 07:21.935
Come on, man!

07:21.980 --> 07:24.699
No, look, really,
they're eating, we're drinking.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.093
They want it.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.937
The whole world isn't Zoo magazine.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.448
Everybody isn't just wanting it
the whole time.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.695
People have a wide range
of emotional states.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.412
- Like what?
- There you go.

07:34.460 --> 07:41.298
Well, they might be feeling pensive or full of
hubris, melancholic, amused or just numb.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.376
Bollocks. They're hot
and they want it. Come on.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.535
God!

07:44.580 --> 07:47.652
Hey, there. We just wondered
if you don't mind hanging out

07:47.700 --> 07:51.295
with a couple of yardies, whether maybe
we could join you for a drink?

07:51.340 --> 07:52.489
I'm very sorry.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.689
Why not?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.571
(Mark) 'Oh, God, this is awful!

07:55.620 --> 07:59.249
'It's so obvious. We don't just want
to chat, it's not just friendly.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.531
'They know exactly what we're doing,
and the horrible thing is

08:02.580 --> 08:04.775
'they don't even seem to mind.'

08:04.820 --> 08:07.015
I'm Aurora and this is my sister, Lucy.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.175
Jez and Mark.

08:08.220 --> 08:11.496
You're the first people
to talk to us all night.

08:11.540 --> 08:15.169
Oh, apart from the British Kidney
Foundation guy with the stickers.

08:15.220 --> 08:18.496
Yeah, right. Mr Freebie
looking for a handout.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.213
Yep. So listen,
what can I get you two?

08:21.260 --> 08:22.932
How about a foot of wine?

08:22.980 --> 08:27.929
Can I get a metre of vodka...
with an inch of tonic?

08:27.980 --> 08:30.778
'Come on, Mark, turn it on!
Play the game! '

08:30.820 --> 08:32.538
Oh, naughty.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.730
You've combined metric and imperial.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.375
You might get an interdenominational...

08:38.419 --> 08:41.491
You know, from mixing
the two measurement systems,

08:41.539 --> 08:43.417
a hangover of that kind.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.610
'Just stay mute, Mark.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.378
'You're a social freak.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.809
'Remain in your compound.'

08:51.940 --> 08:54.579
So that's great you're in a band.
What's it called?

08:54.620 --> 08:56.736
Oh, right now we're called
Various Artists

08:56.780 --> 08:58.771
just to fuck over people with iPods.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.892
We think it'll set us back
two or three years, which is cool.

09:01.940 --> 09:05.137
So you've got a great canal boat.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.853
We're canalists too. We love canalling.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.333
Actually it's our dad's.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.974
Right. The upkeep must be a nightmare.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.931
The... The mooring costs alone...

09:13.980 --> 09:16.255
(Jez) 'He really knows
how to murder a vibe.'

09:16.300 --> 09:17.528
You'll have to excuse Mummy.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.095
Mummy? Wow, doesn't your mum
mind the dog being called?

09:21.140 --> 09:22.778
Oh, God, no. Mum's dead.

09:22.820 --> 09:26.415
Mummy's just had lots of lovely
babies, haven't you?

09:26.460 --> 09:28.052
Naughty, slutty Mummy.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.089
Right.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.653
So have you got a girlfriend?

09:30.700 --> 09:35.137
'Technically, a fiancee
is not a girlfriend.'

09:35.180 --> 09:37.011
You know not... not really.

09:37.060 --> 09:40.336
I had a boyfriend till last month.
He was a bit hippy for my taste.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.214
Plus a lot of umming and ahhing.
So one day I turned round to him

09:44.260 --> 09:47.457
and I said, "Benny, it's time
to shit or get off the pot."

09:47.500 --> 09:49.411
Oh, right, and did he?

09:49.460 --> 09:51.052
Oh, yeah, like a shot.

09:51.100 --> 09:54.649
Luce, will you give me a hand
looking for the secret bottle of voddie?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.294
'Oh, God, vodka! It'll be an orgy.

09:57.340 --> 10:01.094
'Great! Disappoint three people
instead of just one! '

10:01.140 --> 10:04.018
This is going great.
Things are going to happen.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.379
Nothing's happening.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.092
Forget about Sophie, all right?

10:07.140 --> 10:10.098
You're allowed a freebie
on the stag, like Pedge in Estonia.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.778
When he had sex with a prostitute

10:11.820 --> 10:13.811
and gave his wife
that aggressive yeast infection?

10:13.860 --> 10:16.055
It's what people do. Just get on with it.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.012
I don't like her! I don't fancy her!

10:19.060 --> 10:22.018
Do you think Pedge fancied
that hooker? Of course he didn't!

10:22.060 --> 10:24.255
He didn't let that stop him.
He did the right thing.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.528
I just wanna go to bed!

10:25.580 --> 10:28.811
You can't. There are two of them,
there has to be two of us.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.851
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- You're not going anywhere.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.653
You can't say you're going to bed
at nine in the evening.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.214
You're gonna sit there
and talk about something funny

10:36.260 --> 10:39.969
you've seen on reality TV, and stop
going on and on about the euro.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.090
We're in it now and there's nothing
you can do about it.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.529
We are not in the euro, Jeremy!

10:44.580 --> 10:47.014
So you can have your squalid little night.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.769
I'm gonna go and read Roy Jenkins
on Winston Churchill.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.653
Oh, here we go. Dad's back.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.691
Ahoy there!

10:55.740 --> 10:57.298
Oh, that's a shame.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.456
I was looking forward to having some fun.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.732
'Dodged a bullet there.
Although maybe not.

11:03.780 --> 11:07.773
'My attraction to her is so minimal for once
I might have been able to do it for hours.

11:07.820 --> 11:10.971
'An endless, joyless fuck session.'

11:14.180 --> 11:17.092
(Mark) 'I'm not wearing them!
They're Hitler's boots!

11:17.140 --> 11:19.813
'I'm not wearing Hitler's boots!

11:19.860 --> 11:21.737
'What the hell's going on?!

11:21.780 --> 11:24.248
'Why are we moving?! Jeremy can't be up!

11:24.300 --> 11:26.211
'Someone's trying to steal the boat!

11:26.260 --> 11:28.933
'Pirates! I'm being Shanghaied! '

11:28.980 --> 11:31.972
- Morning, shipmate.
- Jeremy, what the hell is going on?

11:32.020 --> 11:34.773
I'm just getting going.
Couldn't let them get away, could we?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.374
Ah, this is a new one - water stalking.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.854
It's not! It's just friendly!

11:41.900 --> 11:43.538
Ahoy there, shipmates!

11:43.580 --> 11:48.574
Jeremy! Last one to lunch at the Lamb
and Flag in Garsington is a loser.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.249
Ha! You're on! Warp factor three,
please, Scotty.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.370
'Oh, great, I'm Scotty.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.695
'He's cross-breeding
with the beautiful aliens

11:56.740 --> 11:58.298
'and I'm stuck in the engine room

11:58.340 --> 12:00.695
'with the probably
cancer-emitting fuel cells.'

12:03.860 --> 12:05.737
So I'm not in a relationship right now.

12:05.780 --> 12:08.499
I've just been hurt
too many times, you know.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:10.460 --> 12:13.418
It's like I've got a river of pain
running through me,

12:13.460 --> 12:16.691
from here right the way down to here.

12:16.740 --> 12:21.655
Kind of like Jim Morrison
or Russell Brand.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.931
Jez has offered to do the shopping run
and no-one else is fit to drive.

12:24.980 --> 12:26.379
Reckon you can handle a 4x4?

12:26.420 --> 12:28.490
Sure. No sweat.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.418
'4x4! Piece of piss! Probably.'

12:33.460 --> 12:34.859
So you're in the credit racket?

12:34.900 --> 12:37.812
Yes, that's my... racket.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.373
I should pick your brains.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.888
That's my new setup in Bangalore,
a credit call centre.

12:41.940 --> 12:45.455
God, you've got fingers in
so many pies. How d'you keep track?

12:45.500 --> 12:48.731
Dad comes up with a brainwave
and then he hires a load of little people

12:48.780 --> 12:51.294
who never went to university
to work out the details.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.774
'I'm with the business elite,
shitting on the little guy.'

12:53.820 --> 12:54.969
Brilliant.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.739
I'm looking for an associate
who can help me staff up.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.817
Got any contacts? Anyone who could
handle a management role?

13:00.860 --> 13:04.170
Oh! Right. I'll have a think.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.256
'Oh, my God, India!

13:06.300 --> 13:08.814
'Could be my way out.
Goodbye Sophie,

13:08.860 --> 13:13.411
'goodbye sexual humiliation, hello
Corrigan the neo-colonial overlord.'

13:13.460 --> 13:15.610
I thought for a minute
you were gonna ask me!

13:15.660 --> 13:19.289
Pretty big step up for you.
You're a kind of a numbers droid.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.012
Not really. I'm...

13:21.060 --> 13:22.937
'Oh, my God!

13:22.980 --> 13:26.256
'I've entered an interview situation
and there's a hand near my cock!

13:26.300 --> 13:29.895
This is like that dream I had
about Alan Sugar and the badger.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.373
I have experience of managing a team.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.092
But this will be 300-odd employees!

13:33.140 --> 13:38.578
Yes, but I've developed a portfolio
of skills over the last three years,

13:38.620 --> 13:41.737
which enabled me to rise
to new challenges with ease.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.534
'Maybe this is a test.
She can't actually fancy me.

13:45.580 --> 13:49.050
'Or a trick. Maybe they're Johnson
and Sophie wearing masks

13:49.100 --> 13:52.729
'and this is all being paid for
by MTV and the Playboy channel.'

13:54.300 --> 13:57.451
'God, look at me drive. I'm Clarkson.'

13:57.500 --> 13:59.730
Are you sure it's OK
to put in unleaded?

13:59.780 --> 14:01.736
We always normally do diesel.

14:01.780 --> 14:03.930
Oh, trust me,
these babies run on anything.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.256
So after we dump the shopping,
do you wanna go for a little stroll?

14:07.300 --> 14:08.892
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.168
Cool.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.656
Do you wanna turn this around
and I'll see you in a sec?

14:13.700 --> 14:16.214
'I think I love her.
I think I'm falling in love...

14:16.260 --> 14:18.854
'or getting a bone-on,
which is basically the same thing

14:18.900 --> 14:21.892
'when you get rid of all
the Valentine's cards and bullshit.'

14:21.940 --> 14:22.850
Come on, Mummy. >

14:22.900 --> 14:26.859
'Oh, yeah! Pissed and stoned
in a gas guzzler. This is the life.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.097
'AIready given a quid to Greenpeace
this year, so I'm golden.'

14:30.140 --> 14:31.619
DOG WHINES

14:31.660 --> 14:33.696
'Not the dog. Not the dog!

14:33.740 --> 14:36.618
'Shit, the dog! '

14:36.160 --> 14:39.789
'Oh, yeah, this is cool.
Just don't think about the dead dog.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.116
'lf I don't think about it, there's always
a chance it didn't happen.'

14:43.160 --> 14:44.275
Let's roll, cowboy.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.309
Where's Mummy?

14:46.360 --> 14:47.395
Mummy?

14:47.440 --> 14:48.793
Yeah. I let her out for a piss.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.400
- Are you sure she was with us?
- She was on the back seat!

14:51.440 --> 14:52.839
She must've run off.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.599
'Except she definitely hasn't cos
I'm carrying her round in this bag.'

14:55.640 --> 14:57.073
She never just runs off!

14:57.120 --> 15:00.112
She is a wild animal.
You know, the call of the wild.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.197
She might've become
leader of a pack of foxes or...

15:03.240 --> 15:05.993
Jez, it's Mummy.
We're not just leaving her!

15:06.040 --> 15:08.474
'Why did I put her in the bag?!
I should've thrown her like a discus.'

15:08.520 --> 15:10.795
Mum-my! Come on, Jeremy!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.432
Mummy...

15:12.480 --> 15:14.755
- Mummy!
- Mummy...

15:14.800 --> 15:17.394
Oh, God! I don't know what
I'd do if I lost her!

15:17.440 --> 15:19.158
'Well, you're very close to finding out.'

15:19.200 --> 15:22.237
- Mummy!
- Mummy!

15:23.960 --> 15:26.394
And in the last quarter at JLB,

15:26.440 --> 15:29.477
I personally presided over
an increase of close to 17%.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.159
(Groans) My mate Carly again.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.512
"Oh, I'm so sad, I'm gonna take
a load of pills, muh, muh, muh."

15:36.560 --> 15:39.632
Same shit, different day.
I'll catch you up.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.389
'Wealthy, lovely family. If only
she wasn't such a horrible person,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.351
'she'd be the woman of my dreams.'

15:45.400 --> 15:49.029
Mark, if anything did happen,
how quickly could you up sticks, though?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.433
Anything tying you down?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.993
'Does a marriage count? '

15:52.040 --> 15:53.712
No. Not that I can think of.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.639
Wherever I lay my hat, pending
legal searches, that's my home.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.559
Cool. So, you and Lucy
seem pretty sweet on each other.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.477
Oh. Yeah.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.034
What do you think of her... honestly?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.152
'I think she might have
a borderline personality disorder.'

16:09.200 --> 16:11.760
I think she's... Iovely.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.995
Oh, that's nice. I'll tell her that.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.189
OK. Great.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.313
'Maybe instead of marrying Sophie
I should just marry Lucy.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.909
'No, stop trying to marry everyone,
Mark! No need to marry people! '

16:25.600 --> 16:27.795
"Hey, it's Sophie.
Please leave a message."

16:27.840 --> 16:29.353
'Answerphone. Yes! '

16:29.400 --> 16:33.359
Hey, Soph, sorry to have missed you.
Having a great time on my stag.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.436
Bye. Let's speak soon.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.233
'AIthough probably not,
because I know when you're busy

16:38.280 --> 16:39.793
'and that's when I always ring you.'

16:39.840 --> 16:41.432
- Guess what, Jez.
- What?

16:41.480 --> 16:45.109
Malcolm's headhunting for co-manager
of his Indian call centre.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.116
- Right. So?
- There's a chance,

16:47.160 --> 16:50.709
a slight but very definite chance,
that I could be off to India.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.718
And you know what that means -
won't be able to get married.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.512
- No?
- Of course not!

16:55.560 --> 16:58.870
Sophie couldn't ask me to turn down
the opportunity of a lifetime!

16:58.920 --> 17:00.876
- Couldn't she come?
- Oh, no, there...

17:00.920 --> 17:03.753
there'd be visa issues,
endless complications.

17:03.800 --> 17:08.828
No, I'm afraid to say this could put a great
deal of strain on the whole relationship.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.676
Brilliant. Well done, mate.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.315
He's nibbling but he hasn't bitten yet.
So I'm just gonna get Gerard

17:14.359 --> 17:17.796
to e-mail through my CV
and then wow him with a big pitch.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.877
So, you'd just... go?

17:20.920 --> 17:23.275
Oh, Jez, don't look like that!

17:23.319 --> 17:26.596
You could always come! You could
start again, find a new career.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.153
I could be your butler.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.795
I'd be the Maharaja,
you'd be my white concubine.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.310
I could probably live like a king
on a tenner a week. I'd do fuck all.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.554
Just lie around smoking dope

17:36.600 --> 17:39.672
and have a bit of a go on the washing-up
before you got home.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.996
I'd probably get a record deal
just because I've been to Carnaby Street.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.393
I'll be the coolest man in India.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.113
And maybe we can get one small servant.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.720
'We'll need a servant.
These leftovers are from two nights ago,

17:49.760 --> 17:51.318
'and he never empties the bin.

17:51.360 --> 17:55.148
'Oh, God, I bet it's bursting at the seams
with used condoms and porn.'

17:55.200 --> 17:57.430
Fuck! Aah!

17:57.480 --> 18:01.917
There's a... There's a dead beast
in our bin, Jeremy!

18:01.960 --> 18:04.428
- All right, keep your voice down.
- A dead dog in our bin!

18:04.480 --> 18:07.995
- How has this happened?
- There's no point shouting about it.

18:08.040 --> 18:12.511
Well, why not?!
Jeremy, is this... Mummy?!

18:12.560 --> 18:18.157
Look, earlier, in the 4x4, I had an accident.
I mean, the clutch on that thing...

18:18.200 --> 18:20.919
Oh, right! Brilliant!
You've killed Mummy!

18:20.960 --> 18:22.871
What the hell is it doing in our bin?!

18:22.920 --> 18:26.595
I had to hide it. Aurora had me
looking for it for about four hours.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.551
Then she made me make posters.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.192
But... the bin, Jeremy!

18:30.240 --> 18:33.869
The bin's for household waste,
not beloved pets, et cetera!

18:33.920 --> 18:36.798
Mark, if I can just get rid
of the dog corpse,

18:36.840 --> 18:39.149
there's a chance
I still might get laid here.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.239
Oh, right. This is sort of like a disgusting
version of The Great Egg Race!

18:46.000 --> 18:47.831
This doesn't feel great.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.110
It's not great, Jez, that's why.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.879
There's no chance of it being
traced back to us now, though.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.151
- Cos it might've been micro-chipped.
- Exactly. No.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.193
All things considered - my career
prospects, your sexual desperation -

19:00.240 --> 19:03.232
this is probably the best thing to do.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.669
There's a hell of a lot of steam.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.235
Yeah. As it turns out,
dogs do seem to be mostly water.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.919
Well, it's going a bit,
just not the legs.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.997
Put the legs back on in the middle.
Maybe it'll burn better.

19:16.040 --> 19:20.716
If you hadn't refused to pay for
firelighters it would've gone by now.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.991
You shouldn't need firelighters
to burn a dog, Jeremy!

19:24.040 --> 19:25.632
How would you know?

19:25.680 --> 19:28.194
Shit, it's going out.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.073
Look, I've gotta get my pitch sorted
before I see Malcolm.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.599
We'll have to bury it. Get the spade.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.835
- What spade?
- You didn't bring a spade?

19:34.880 --> 19:37.872
Do you think I'm some kind of freelance
dog-murdering Mafia man?

19:37.920 --> 19:43.313
Oh, great! So we've got no fire, no spade.
We'll just have to dig with our hands.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.114
Jeremy, there are many things
I would do to help you,

19:47.160 --> 19:49.754
but digging a hole in
the wintry earth with my bare hands

19:49.800 --> 19:53.952
so that you can bury the corpse of
a dog you killed is not one of them.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.469
'I'll just take it to one of those massive
council bins. Dump and run.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.115
'Just like my paperboy days.
(Chuckles) Screw you, Murdoch.'

20:04.160 --> 20:06.469
- Jeremy.
- Hi!

20:06.520 --> 20:08.670
This is my last poster.
How did you get on?

20:08.720 --> 20:11.518
Yep. Good.
Got rid of all of mine, too.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.949
'Just keep lying till
the kissing can start.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.073
'I mean, it'd have to be a fucking
good poster to get that dog back.'

20:18.120 --> 20:21.237
I might call it a day and head back
to the barge. Coming?

20:21.280 --> 20:22.599
OK.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.119
'Shit. Gotta dump the evidence.'

20:24.160 --> 20:26.435
BAG FALLS

20:26.480 --> 20:27.879
Jeremy, you've dropped your bag.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.797
Yeah. So I have.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.713
Thanks, honey.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.355
'Just act normal. I'll tell her what happened
immediately after I've come.'

20:38.400 --> 20:41.870
And as... as you can see
I've been in the top ten percentile

20:41.920 --> 20:47.870
of performers at JLB for the last
three financial years in a row, so...

20:47.920 --> 20:49.876
'Shit! I'm losing him! '

20:49.920 --> 20:51.831
And if you look at the bottom,

20:51.880 --> 20:55.111
you'll see that my hobbies include
history and going to the movies.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.277
- I like going to the movies.
- 'Of course you do. Everyone does.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.073
'Man seeks woman.
Must be interested in film,

21:01.120 --> 21:04.556
'breathing oxygen and converting
protein intake into muscle energy.'

21:04.600 --> 21:06.238
Hi, guys.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.759
We're interrupting. We should probably...

21:07.800 --> 21:10.394
Sit down, Jez! Join the party!

21:10.440 --> 21:13.159
- (Lucy) Any luck?
- No. Still nothing.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.751
Bollocks. OK, Dad, time to turn on
the money hose. Up the reward.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.916
(Mark) 'Fucking hell! He's got Mummy!

21:19.960 --> 21:23.748
'He's brought a dead dog
into my pitch, the stupid bastard! '

21:23.800 --> 21:26.109
Sorry, Mark.
Carry on. What were you saying?

21:26.160 --> 21:31.075
<i>Er, yes, as I was saying, I... I love
cinema, especially the films of</i>

21:31.120 --> 21:34.635
Spielberg, Lucas and the man
who did The Usual Suspects.

21:34.680 --> 21:35.954
What's in the bag?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.390
Oh, er, Mark and I had a... barbecue.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.635
Oh, a barbecue. Yum.
Have you got any left?

21:41.680 --> 21:44.194
No. No, not really.
No, we were really hungry.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.390
You have got a bit left, I can see.

21:46.440 --> 21:50.672
Well, it's really, really badly cooked.
Mark couldn't be bothered to get firelighters.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.599
Well, just keeping a handle
on the purse strings there.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.471
ABC, Always Be Cost-cutting.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.635
Ah-ha!

21:57.680 --> 21:59.352
- Come on, Jez.
- I really don't think it's a good...

21:59.400 --> 22:01.470
Oh, we've only got cheese and humus.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.273
What is it?
It doesn't look very much like...

22:06.320 --> 22:07.753
It's turkey. It's turkey leg.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.199
Is that all right?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.151
What can I tell you,
I'm no Ainsley Harriott.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.713
It looks weird!

22:12.760 --> 22:14.751
What's going on, Jeremy?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.597
Nothing! It's just turkey, look.

22:17.760 --> 22:22.276
You see. Mmmm, just...
undercooked, disgusting turkey.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.311
Hey, Mark, would you like some?

22:24.360 --> 22:26.396
- No, thanks.
- Here, eat some turkey.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.874
No, Jeremy, it's not my turkey.

22:28.920 --> 22:32.390
I really feel, since I'm eating
turkey, you should eat some turkey.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.998
It was your idea to barbecue it.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.430
I really don't feel like eating turkey,
Jeremy. I'm full.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.359
'I'm eating dog leg. I have definitely
reached a new low.'

22:41.400 --> 22:45.393
- What's that on it?
- Urgh! There's hairs on it, Jeremy!

22:45.440 --> 22:48.000
- Hairs?
- It's just a hairy turkey!

22:48.960 --> 22:51.190
What's this? "Mummy"?

22:51.240 --> 22:54.869
Mummy is probably the turkey's nickname.
It could easily be.

22:54.920 --> 22:59.596
They ate Mummy! They burned Mummy,
killed her and ate her!

22:59.640 --> 23:02.359
WAILING

23:02.400 --> 23:05.472
Look, er, I'II... I'll e-mail
through my references, Malcolm.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.317
Aurora, I'll call you.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.509
Fuck off, Jeremy!

23:08.560 --> 23:12.633
(Mark) 'Guess not fitting my CV onto
one side of A4 is basically irrelevant now.'

23:12.680 --> 23:15.672
(Jez) 'Probably good things didn't work out,
she is totally over-reacting!

23:15.720 --> 23:18.359
'It's not like I ate her mum or dad! '

23:18.400 --> 23:19.992
Did you actually have to eat it?

23:20.040 --> 23:22.190
I don't know. I keep wondering that.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.391
But, y'know, in the moment
it really did feel like I needed to eat it.
