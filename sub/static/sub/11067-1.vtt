00:59.040 --> 01:00.359

<i>"vigorously assaulted...</i>

02:11.400 --> 02:16.428
"The boundaries of propriety were

02:16.840 --> 02:20.310
"The boundaries of propriety were
vigorously assaulted, as was only right,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.868
"but not quite breached, as was also right.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.393
"Nevertheless,

02:26.720 --> 02:28.278
"she was not pleased. "

02:48.680 --> 02:50.159
- What is it?
- Jane.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.355
Oh.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.873
Jane!

03:10.480 --> 03:12.596
Oh, dear me.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.792
That girl needs a husband.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.510
And who's good enough? Nobody.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.030
I blame you for that.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.588
Being too much the model of perfection.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.671
I've shared your bed for 32 years

03:29.760 --> 03:33.799
and perfection is something
I have not encountered.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.915
Yet.

03:38.280 --> 03:42.990
No. Stop it. Mr Austen, it's Sunday!
Stop, no, it's...

03:47.160 --> 03:52.154
The utmost of a woman's character
is expressed in the duties of daughter,

03:53.400 --> 03:58.155
sister and, eventually, wife and mother.

03:59.120 --> 04:05.639
It is secured by soft attraction, virtuous love
and quiet in the early morning.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.752
<i>If a woman happens
to have a particular superiority,</i>

04:10.840 --> 04:15.391
<i>for example, a profound mind,
it is best kept a profound secret.</i>

04:15.560 --> 04:19.553
<i>Humour is liked more, but wit? No.</i>

04:20.560 --> 04:23.472
<i>It is the most treacherous talent of them all.</i>

04:23.560 --> 04:27.553
Now, George, old fellow,
you know you have to stay.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.278
- Jenny!
- George, George.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.197
Hurry along, Jane! We'll be late!

04:40.040 --> 04:42.998
When Her Ladyship calls, we must obey.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.670
Come along, Jane.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.793
<i>Lady Gresham,
may I introduce my niece Comtesse De Feuillide</i>

05:30.640 --> 05:33.473
and Mr Fowle, Cassandra's fiancé.

05:33.560 --> 05:38.953
<i>- Comtesse? Then you presume to be French?
- By marriage.</i>

05:39.040 --> 05:41.793
<i>Monsieur le Comte is not here
to pay his respects?</i>

05:41.880 --> 05:43.916
A prior engagement, ma'am,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.549
<i>Monsieur le Comte was obliged
to pay his respects to Madame le Guillotine.</i>

05:47.640 --> 05:48.675
Oh!

05:51.920 --> 05:54.992
I see your nephew is with us again.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.399
Mr Wisley.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.193
Wisley is indispensable to my happiness.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.431
Well, do sit down.

06:12.560 --> 06:16.348
Mr Fowle and Cassandra
are only recently engaged.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.278
When shall you marry?

06:19.360 --> 06:21.669
- Not for some time, Your Ladyship.
- Why not?

06:21.760 --> 06:23.796
I'm also engaged to go to the West Indies

06:23.880 --> 06:27.077
with Lord Craven's expedition
against the French, as chaplain.

06:27.160 --> 06:32.188
- What has Craven offered you?
- I've hopes of a parish on my return.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.077
How much is it worth?

06:35.760 --> 06:38.228
Enough to marry on, in a modest way.

06:43.840 --> 06:48.118
Mr Wisley, did you know
the Basingstoke assemblies resume?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.953
Very soon, I believe.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.318
- Jane does enjoy a ball.
- Wisley can't abide them.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.914
But, sir,

07:02.480 --> 07:06.917
a ball is an indispensable blessing
to the juvenile part of the neighbourhood.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.072
Everything agreeable in the way of talking
and sitting down together

07:10.160 --> 07:12.674
all managed with the utmost decorum.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.789
An amiable man could not object.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.876
Then I find I'm converted.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.471
Displayed like a brood mare.

07:26.560 --> 07:31.031
- Mr Wisley is a highly eligible young gentleman.
- Oh, Mother!

07:31.120 --> 07:34.556
- You know our situation, Jane.
- Oh!

07:34.640 --> 07:38.235
And he is Lady Gresham's
favourite nephew and heir.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.880
One day, he shall inherit this.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.430
Excellent prospects!

07:50.800 --> 07:55.316
- His small fortune will not buy me.
- What will buy you, cousin?

08:01.760 --> 08:04.433
More wary in the world, Mr Lefroy.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.277
You can pay me for that later.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.999
- Huzzah! Huzzah!
Come on, Mr Lefroy.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.192
Come on, man, hit him!

08:26.160 --> 08:27.354
Lefroy!

08:40.000 --> 08:43.309
Glass of wine with you, sir?
- Madam.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.234
- Displaying to advantage, I see, Lefroy.
- Like the sword, Austen.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.237
How long before you have
to get back to the sticks?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.833
A day.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.148
So soon?

09:01.240 --> 09:04.755
Doghouse, debts, but one must cut
some sort of a figure even in the militia.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.752
Especially when condemned to a parsonage,
my friend.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.909
Yes.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.074
Still, who is this sour-faced little virgin?

09:14.160 --> 09:15.912
Your pardon, ma'am.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.876
Mr Tom Lefroy, may I present Mr John Warren?

09:20.960 --> 09:25.238
Joining me in Hampshire,
my father is preparing us both for holy orders.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.835
I understand you've visited Hampshire, Mr Lefroy.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.353
Last year.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.752
- Long visit, was it?
- Very long, Mr Warren. Almost three hours.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.350
Mr Austen, you're devilishly handsome.
A kiss, a kiss.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.998
Oops!

09:41.600 --> 09:43.591
So, Tom, where should we go? Vauxhall Gardens?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.113
Been there.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.760
Lefroy, there's a Tahitian Love Fest on at White's.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.875
Seen it.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.030
- Crockford's?
- Crockford's? Done that.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.872
Or did it do me?

09:52.960 --> 09:56.077
Wh-wh-wh-what is a Tahitian Love Fest?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.873
Warren!

10:19.520 --> 10:21.750
I humbly beg your pardon, sir.

10:22.600 --> 10:27.958
Theft of one pig is a crime, heinous to be sure,
but two pigs...

10:30.600 --> 10:37.039
Two pigs is a violent assault
on the very sanctity of private property itself.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.395
Excuse me.

10:41.480 --> 10:46.838
You and your kind
are a canker on the body social.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.197
And cankers are cut out.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.072
Transportation for life. Next.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.114
- Why are you here in London, sir?
- To learn the law.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.398
- Which has no other end but what?
- The preservation of the rights of property.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.074
- Against?
- The mob.

11:08.160 --> 11:13.359
Therefore, order is kept because we have...

11:13.440 --> 11:17.228
- A standing army?
- Good manners, sir, and prudence.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.039
- Do you know that word? Prudence?
- Yes.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.831
Consider myself.

11:23.960 --> 11:29.432
I was born rich, certainly, but I remain rich
by virtue of exceptional conduct.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.875
I have shown restraint.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.714
Your mother, my sister, became poor
because she did not...

11:36.800 --> 11:38.279
She married my father because she loved him.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.239
Yes, and that's why you have so many
brothers and sisters back there in...

11:42.320 --> 11:43.833
- Limerick.
- Mmm.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.716
If you hope, I say hope...

11:50.760 --> 11:54.275
If you aspire to inherit my property,

11:56.560 --> 11:59.438
you must prove yourself more worthy.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.318
But what do we find? We find dissipation

12:02.400 --> 12:06.757
wild enough to glut the imaginings
of a Hottentot braggadocio.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.316
Wild companions, gambling,

12:11.520 --> 12:16.036
running around St James's
like a neck-or-nothing young blood of the fancy.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.157
- What kind of lawyer will that make?
- Typical.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.118
Humour?

12:29.440 --> 12:33.558
Well, you're going to need that
because I'm teaching you a lesson.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.031
I'm sending you to stay with your other relations,
the Lefroys.

12:43.080 --> 12:48.552
- Uncle, they live in the country.
- Deep in the country.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.391
- Jane?
- Mmm?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.279
Can you?

13:12.600 --> 13:13.919
Thank you.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.072
I think you two
quite the prettiest sisters in England.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.470
Mr Fowle will be enchanted.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.234
San Domingo is half a world away.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.637
He'll forget me.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.076
Impossible.
Look at the memory you're giving him tonight.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.793
Cassie.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.793
His heart will stop at the very sight of you
or he doesn't deserve to live.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.591
And, yes, I'm aware of the contradiction
embodied in that sentence.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.634
Is it?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.993
- Jane!
- Henry!

13:58.120 --> 13:59.553
You look wonderful.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.311
Well, hello, John. It's very good to see you.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.119
- Nice to see you.
- Oh, John!

14:07.120 --> 14:08.269
George!

14:10.040 --> 14:11.996
Leave your brother alone.

14:15.120 --> 14:19.796
Jane! Jane? Have you heard?
My father's nephew is staying with us.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.995
From London.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.593
- He is a...
- A brilliant young lawyer.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.671
- Lucy, please.
- With a reputation.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.875
For lateness?

14:28.040 --> 14:30.998
Hat off, George.
Hat off, Father's ready.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.478
- Thank you, John.
- Please.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.950
The family is always moving
in great ways and small.

14:38.040 --> 14:43.672
Firstly, the small.
Henry is back from Oxford with his degree,

14:44.440 --> 14:45.998
- thank goodness.
- Well done.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.198
And our friend John, my new student.
Then the great.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.592
Cassandra, who is forsaking us for her
brother Edward and his family at the coast

14:55.520 --> 14:59.229
whilst Robert voyages to the West Indies
with Lord Craven's expedition.

14:59.320 --> 15:05.316
And then, together, they can embark on
that most great and most serious journey of life.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.875
Miss Austen, I understand
you will be favouring us with a reading?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.632
- Do, Jane.
Do.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.631
Oh, please, Miss Jane.
Oh, yes, Jane, do.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.039
Please, Jane.

15:22.560 --> 15:27.680
"Advice from a young lady on the engagement
of her beloved sister Cassandra

15:28.760 --> 15:30.193
"to a Fowle. "

15:34.800 --> 15:39.112
"His addresses were offered in a manner
violent enough to be flattering.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.478
"The boundaries of propriety
were vigorously assaulted, as was only right,

15:43.600 --> 15:46.558
"but not quite breached, as was also right.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.631
"Nevertheless, she was... "

15:58.240 --> 16:03.268
And may I introduce my young nephew
Mr Thomas Lefroy?

16:03.840 --> 16:04.875
Oh.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.109
And he's more than welcome.
Join us, sir, join us.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.752
Green velvet coat. Vastly fashionable.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.635
You'll find this vastly amusing.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.757
"His addresses were...

16:26.600 --> 16:29.876
"The boundaries of propriety
were vigorously assaulted,

16:29.960 --> 16:34.476
"as was only right, but not quite breached,
as was also right.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.391
"Nevertheless, she was not pleased.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.110
"Her taste was refined, her sentiments noble,
her person lovely, her figure elegant. "

16:44.400 --> 16:47.358
Good God, there's writing
on both sides of those pages.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.714
Shh. Damn it, man.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.358
"'It was only yesterday I repelled Lord Graham
and his six million,

16:53.440 --> 16:56.750
"'which would have lasted me
almost a twelvemonth,

16:56.840 --> 16:58.512
"'with economies... '

17:02.040 --> 17:03.519
"'... a treasure

17:03.600 --> 17:06.910
"'greater than all the jewels in India,
an adoring heart. "'

17:07.000 --> 17:08.069
God!

17:08.160 --> 17:11.152
"'And pray, madam,
what am I to expect in return? '

17:11.640 --> 17:15.076
"'Expect? Well, you may expect
to have me pleased from time to time. "'

17:15.160 --> 17:16.638
Is this who I am?

17:17.880 --> 17:22.874
"And a sweet, gentle, pleading, innocent,

17:22.960 --> 17:29.229
"delicate, sympathetic, loyal, untutored,
adoring female heart. "

17:34.320 --> 17:35.548
The end.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.434
- Bravo, Jane.
Well done, Jane.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.548
Bravo.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.799
Well done.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.958
She speaks so well.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.439
Well, excessively charming, I thought.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.273
Well, accomplished enough, perhaps,

18:02.360 --> 18:07.275
but a metropolitan mind may be
less susceptible to extended, juvenile self-regard.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.714
Well, thank you.
We're both very proud.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.075
<i># In airy dreams</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:43.079
<i>#... absent love to see</i>

18:54.680 --> 18:58.309
<i># Dear you, oh, to think</i>

18:58.840 --> 19:04.437
<i># On thee #</i>

19:37.440 --> 19:39.670
Careful there, old fellow.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.832
Fine piece, Mr Lefroy.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.228
Handled a gun before, have you, Tom?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.355
Mmm.
- Tom!

19:48.720 --> 19:49.869
Jesus!

19:57.320 --> 19:59.470
- Tom.
- Uncle?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.709
Why not try a walk?

20:03.560 --> 20:08.031
There's some very fine country round about.
Very fine.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.789
A walk.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.795
Miss!

21:03.560 --> 21:05.073
Miss! Miss!

21:05.440 --> 21:06.998
Miss! Miss, I...

21:10.720 --> 21:11.835
Miss?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.395
Miss?

21:15.480 --> 21:18.119
- Miss...
- Austen.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.353
Mr Lefroy.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.436
Yes, I know, but I am alone.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.277
- Except for me.
- Exactly.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.998
Oh, come!

21:28.080 --> 21:31.709
What rules of conduct apply
in this rural situation?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.439
We have been introduced, have we not?

21:35.440 --> 21:39.956
What value is there in an introduction
when you cannot even remember my name?

21:40.080 --> 21:43.231
Indeed, can barely stay awake in my presence.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.109
Madam.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.715
These scruples must seem very provincial
to a gentleman with such elevated airs,

21:49.800 --> 21:53.759
but I do not devise these rules.
I am merely obliged to obey them.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.796
I have been told
there is much to see upon a walk

21:58.880 --> 22:03.112
but all I've detected so far is a general
tendency to green above and brown below.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.875
Yes, well, others have detected more.
It is celebrated.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.952
- There's even a book about Selborne Wood.
- Oh.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.912
A novel, perhaps?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.828
Novels?

22:18.480 --> 22:23.508
Being poor, insipid things, read by mere women,
even, God forbid, written by mere women?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.113
I see, we're talking of your reading.

22:25.200 --> 22:29.079
As if the writing of women did not display
the greatest powers of mind,

22:29.160 --> 22:32.391
knowledge of human nature,
the liveliest effusions of wit and humour

22:32.480 --> 22:35.233
and the best-chosen language imaginable?

22:35.320 --> 22:38.278
- Was I deficient in rapture?
- In consciousness.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.998
It was...

22:44.160 --> 22:47.277
It was accomplished.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.399
It was ironic.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.710
- And you're sure I've not offended you?
- Not at all.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.078
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
the Grand Vizier's Flight.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.072
- May I have the honour?
- How kind, cousin.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.068
- Miss Austen.
- Mr Wisley.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.918
May I have the pleasure of this next dance?

23:45.800 --> 23:48.519
Oh, no, we're so late.
Take care.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.392
Oh, thank you, Tom.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.629
Hurry.
Lucy.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.989
Oh!

24:16.600 --> 24:18.113
I am mortified.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.358
I practised, but it won't stick.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.917
What a lovely pair they make.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.319
Ah, Sister.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.870
What do you make of Mr Lefroy?
We're honoured by his presence.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.949
You think?

24:42.040 --> 24:44.554
He does, with his preening, prancing,
Irish-cum-Bond-Street airs.

24:44.640 --> 24:45.709
Jane.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.509
Well, I call it very high indeed, refusing
to dance when there are so few gentleman.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.068
- Henry, are all your friends so disagreeable?
- Jane.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.151
Where exactly in Ireland
does he come from, anyway?

24:54.240 --> 24:56.037
Limerick, Miss Austen.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.352
I would regard it as a mark of extreme favour

25:06.440 --> 25:09.830
if you would stoop
to honour me with this next dance.

25:15.200 --> 25:19.079
Being the first to dance with me, madam,
I feel it only fair to inform you

25:19.160 --> 25:22.436
that you carry the standard
for Hampshire hospitality.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.671
Ah, then your country reputation
depends on my report.

25:25.760 --> 25:30.311
<i>This, by the way, is called a country dance,
after the French, contredanse.</i>

25:33.680 --> 25:37.195
Not because it is exhibited
at an uncouth rural assembly

25:37.280 --> 25:38.952
with glutinous pies,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.033
execrable Madeira

25:44.720 --> 25:46.278
and truly anarchic dancing.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.669
You judge the company severely, madam.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.157
- I was describing what you'd be thinking.
- Allow me to think for myself.

25:52.240 --> 25:55.357
Gives me leave to do the same, sir,
and come to a different conclusion.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.989
- Will you give so much to a woman?
- It must depend on the woman

25:59.080 --> 26:01.036
and what she thinks of me.

26:02.280 --> 26:06.193
But you are above being pleased.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.795
And I think that you, miss, what was it?

26:10.880 --> 26:13.189
- Austen. Mr?
- Lefroy.

26:15.080 --> 26:20.757
I think that you, Miss Austen,
consider yourself a cut above the company.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.429
Me?

26:25.560 --> 26:27.152
You, ma'am,

26:28.080 --> 26:30.230
secretly.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.429
How many times did you stand up
with that gentleman, Jane?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.397
Was it twice?
- Twice would have been partial.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.040
- Thrice would have been absolutely...
Flagrant.

26:48.120 --> 26:52.318
Careful, Jane, Lucy is right.
Mr Lefroy does have a reputation.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.789
Presumably as the most disagreeable...

26:54.880 --> 26:58.793
<i>"... insolent, arrogant, impudent,</i>

26:59.640 --> 27:05.158
<i>"insufferable, impertinent of men. "</i>

27:11.640 --> 27:13.437
Too many adjectives.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.356
What is she trying to say?

27:28.920 --> 27:31.434
On your toes, gentlemen. No singles.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.271
Bowler's end, bowler's end.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.791
Again!
Run for more.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.838
I never feel more French
than when I watch cricket.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.555
- Out.
- Not out.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.675
- No?
- No.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.352
Is he out?

27:57.520 --> 28:00.557
I begin to suspect
you're flirting with my brother, cousin.

28:00.640 --> 28:04.394
Flirting is a woman's trade.
One must keep in practice.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.039
You're gone.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.072
Well played, Tom.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.230
We're depending on you.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.752
Oh, it's Mr Warren's... turn.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.599
Best of luck!

28:20.680 --> 28:22.079
John Warren!

28:23.560 --> 28:25.278
Good luck, Mr Warren.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.955
John never was very good, though.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.038
Easy!

28:42.960 --> 28:44.359
Run, Warren, run!

28:44.440 --> 28:45.714
Quickly, hurry!
Run!

28:45.800 --> 28:47.392
Jolly good show!

28:48.160 --> 28:49.354
Watch.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.513
You're out.
- Yah!

28:52.600 --> 28:54.113
You're gone, Mr Warren.
- Oh, dear.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.997
Prodigious, Tom, prodigious.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.357
Thank you, Warren. On your way.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.998
Same again, Tom.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.915
Well done, Mr Warren.
- Bad ball. It's a terrible wicket.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.117
I hope you're not too disappointed, Miss Austen.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.237
Four more to win, Wisley.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.350
Who's next?
Come on!

29:20.520 --> 29:21.999
She can't...
- Jane!

29:22.080 --> 29:24.469
What on earth are you going to do?

29:24.560 --> 29:26.755
Irrepressible.
she can.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.468
Move in!

29:41.440 --> 29:42.873
Go easy, Tom.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.438
Be gentle, Lefroy!

30:10.800 --> 30:12.791
Run, Jane, run!

30:12.880 --> 30:14.836
- Move!
- Run!

30:16.240 --> 30:17.958
Only four more to win.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.788
Bowler's end! Move yourself, you lout!

30:24.080 --> 30:25.957
One more!
Quickly!

30:26.480 --> 30:27.833
Go, go, go!

30:27.920 --> 30:29.194
Not out.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.314
Bad luck, Lefroy.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.429
See?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.272
She was so good.

30:49.880 --> 30:53.759
- You've played this game before?
- No choice, you see. She was raised by brothers.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.831
Time for a swim, I think.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.193
Well played, Henry.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.397
<i>I dedicate our victory to La Comtesse de Feuillide.</i>

31:07.960 --> 31:11.270
- Now, there's a decent bit of river over the hill.
- Oh, yes?

31:16.480 --> 31:17.708
Careful!

31:34.760 --> 31:36.273
Come on, let's go!

31:38.080 --> 31:39.229
Wait!

31:43.560 --> 31:45.869
- Not this time, Lefroy.
- Huh?

31:45.960 --> 31:47.188
You think not?

32:12.480 --> 32:13.754
Down, boy.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.391
- Father, have you seen Tom?
- No, Lucy, I've not.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.517
Besotted. Natural enough at 15.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.555
Love and sense are enemies at any age.

32:31.640 --> 32:35.599
- Mrs Lefroy, may I explore your library?
- Of course.

32:37.080 --> 32:41.073
Lucy would marry him tomorrow,
and what a terrible husband he would make.

32:41.160 --> 32:45.676
I suppose you mean his reputation.
Experience can recommend a man.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.471
- Miss Austen.
- Oh, Mr Lefroy.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.954
- And reading.
- Yes.

33:32.560 --> 33:36.075
<i>I've been looking through your book of the wood.
Mr White's Natural History.</i>

33:36.160 --> 33:37.195
Oh.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.275
- Well, how do you like it?
- I cannot get on. It is too disturbing.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.193
- Disturbing?
- Mmm.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.555
Take this observation.

33:47.800 --> 33:52.237
"Swifts on a fine morning in May,
flying this way, that way,

33:52.440 --> 33:56.479
"sailing around at a great height
perfectly happily. Then...

33:57.120 --> 34:02.148
"Then one leaps onto the back of another,
grasps tightly,

34:02.240 --> 34:08.509
"and forgetting to fly, they both sink
down and down in a great, dying fall,

34:09.440 --> 34:13.399
"fathom after fathom, until the female utters... "

34:18.800 --> 34:19.835
Yes?

34:23.760 --> 34:27.878
"... the female utters a loud, piercing cry

34:31.000 --> 34:32.194
"of ecstasy. "

34:37.360 --> 34:40.830
Is this conduct commonplace
in the natural history of Hampshire?

34:46.120 --> 34:51.717
Your ignorance is understandable
since you lack... What shall we call it?

34:53.360 --> 34:54.475
The history?

34:56.920 --> 35:00.037
Propriety commands me to ignorance.

35:00.120 --> 35:04.750
Condemns you to it and your writing
to the status of female accomplishment.

35:05.560 --> 35:10.509
If you wish to practise the art of fiction,
to be the equal of a masculine author,

35:10.880 --> 35:13.348
experience is vital.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.309
I see.

35:18.760 --> 35:23.072
And what qualifies you to offer this advice?

35:23.840 --> 35:25.034
I know more of the world.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.989
A great deal more, I gather.

35:30.440 --> 35:35.070
Enough to know
that your horizons must be... widened

35:37.520 --> 35:39.556
by an extraordinary young man.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.799
By a very dangerous young man,

35:42.880 --> 35:45.633
one who has, no doubt,
infected the hearts of many a young...

35:45.720 --> 35:49.235
- Young woman with the soft corruption...
- Read this

35:50.600 --> 35:52.238
and you will understand.

35:59.280 --> 36:03.990
<i>"When the philosopher heard that the fortress
of virtue had already been subdued,</i>

36:04.280 --> 36:07.272
<i>"he began to give a large scope to his desires.</i>

36:07.480 --> 36:11.189
<i>"His appetite was not of that squeamish kind
which cannot feed on a dainty</i>

36:11.280 --> 36:12.952
<i>- "because another... "
"Another has tasted it. "</i>

36:13.040 --> 36:16.794
- He's not tasting this dainty.
- What, dear?

36:17.680 --> 36:20.353
<i>"... nor had her face
much appearance of beauty.</i>

36:20.440 --> 36:23.750
<i>"But her clothes being torn
from all the upper part of her body... "</i>

36:23.840 --> 36:28.231
<i>"... her breasts, which were well formed
and extremely white,</i>

36:28.800 --> 36:33.316
<i>"attracted the eyes of her deliverer,
and for a few moments they stood silent... "</i>

36:33.400 --> 36:35.391
<i>"... and gazing at each other. "</i>

36:58.840 --> 37:00.956
I have read your book.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.756
- I have read your book and disapprove.
- Of course you do.

37:06.280 --> 37:12.071
- But of what? The scenes? Characters? The prose?
- No, all good.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.075
- The morality?
- Flawed.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.558
Well, of course, it is. But why?

37:19.640 --> 37:23.713
Vice leads to difficulty, virtue to reward.
Bad characters come to bad ends.

37:23.800 --> 37:29.113
Exactly. But in life, bad characters often thrive.
Take yourself.

37:30.320 --> 37:34.313
And a novel must show how the world truly is,

37:34.560 --> 37:38.394
how characters genuinely think,
how events actually occur.

37:38.480 --> 37:43.873
A novel should somehow reveal
the true source of our actions.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.832
What of my hero's feelings?

37:48.280 --> 37:52.796
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that your hero's very vigorous feelings

37:52.880 --> 37:55.997
caused him and everyone connected with him
a great deal of trouble.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.514
Ah, well, if the book has troubled you...

37:58.840 --> 38:02.150
- Oh, but an orphan must know trouble.
- What sort of trouble?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.632
All sorts of trouble.

38:13.760 --> 38:17.196
Laverton Fair. Vastly entertaining.
Monstrous good idea, Jane.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.477
Yes, Miss Austen, not exactly
your usual society, I'd say.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.835
Show a little imagination, Mr Lefroy.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.874
Trouble here enough.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.793
And freedom, the freedom of men.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.872
Do not you envy it?

38:58.960 --> 39:02.669
But I have the intense pleasure
of observing it so closely.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.235
Ah.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.232
Now, there's a fool,
to go to it with a professional.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.832
- You know about this, of course.
- Of course.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.758
Yes, a vastly fashionable pastime in London.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.238
Beating a man to a pulp. What are you doing?

39:30.760 --> 39:32.955
Mr Lefroy, stop!

39:33.400 --> 39:34.594
Make way!

39:38.960 --> 39:42.032
- Stop!
- Let us see how you fare against me, sir.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.228
Coming through.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.552
Five shillings on the gent. Who will take it?
You, sir? That's the ticket.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.794
Have that.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.595
Thank you.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.672
Go on, hit him!

40:03.000 --> 40:05.355
Come on, Lefroy, hit him, man!

40:06.000 --> 40:09.754
Tom, you must stop.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.433
Come on, Lefroy!

40:17.280 --> 40:18.633
Up, sir.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.589
Tom!

40:25.080 --> 40:26.479
Lucy.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.833
- That's twice he's done that to me.
- You spend money like water.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.349
I'm afraid it's damn low water with me.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.750
- I'm afraid I'm short, sir.
- Take it.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.952
How embarrassing.

40:46.600 --> 40:47.669
Yeh!

40:48.240 --> 40:51.755
Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy?

40:57.080 --> 40:59.196
Was I deficient in propriety?

41:01.800 --> 41:03.791
Why did you do that?

41:04.600 --> 41:07.717
Couldn't waste
all those expensive boxing lessons.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.035
Forgive me if I suspect in you a sense of justice.

41:17.640 --> 41:21.474
I am a lawyer. Justice plays no part in the law.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.672
Is that what you believe?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.999
I believe it. I must.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.233
I beg your leave.

41:42.840 --> 41:46.594
- Her heart is stirred.
- It's a summer squall.

41:46.960 --> 41:52.876
Mr Lefroy will soon be gone.
And Mr Wisley will still be waiting, I hope.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.637
- The man's a booby.
- Oh, he will grow out of that.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.393
And she could fix him with very little trouble.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.159
You could persuade her.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.798
To sacrifice her happiness?

42:04.280 --> 42:09.070
Jane should have not the man
who offers the best price, but the man she wants.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.752
Oh, Mr Austen.

42:11.320 --> 42:15.108
Must we have this conversation
day in and day out?

42:15.200 --> 42:18.431
We'll end up in the gutter if we carry on like this.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.390
Jenny! Mr Austen!

42:40.440 --> 42:41.668
Where are you?

43:05.840 --> 43:08.070
So kind of you to return the call.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.317
- Will you take a dish of tea, ma'am?
- Green tea?

43:16.200 --> 43:19.431
- Brown, Your Ladyship.
- Then no.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.076
Where is your youngest daughter?

43:28.600 --> 43:30.955
She's visiting the poor, ma'am.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.031
Jane? Jane!

43:48.360 --> 43:54.833
At last. Lady Gresham and Mr Wisley
have come to call. Where have you been?

43:56.640 --> 43:58.073
Ma'am. Sir.

43:59.680 --> 44:04.037
Well, perhaps... Perhaps the young people
would like to take a walk?

44:04.120 --> 44:07.829
I see there's a pretty little wilderness
at the side of the house.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.719
Excuse me.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.393
Jane?

44:19.720 --> 44:21.995
- What is she doing?
- Writing.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.831
Can anything be done about it?

44:31.080 --> 44:34.277
Miss Austen, you may know

44:34.360 --> 44:37.158
that I have known you

44:37.240 --> 44:41.028
for some considerable time
during my visits to Steventon.

44:41.120 --> 44:45.671
The garden is so affecting in this season.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.754
Indeed.

44:48.240 --> 44:53.189
- The impression you have given me has always...
- The flowers particularly.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.992
What I'm trying to say is that I...

44:57.080 --> 44:59.310
I have a respectable property of 2,000 a year

44:59.400 --> 45:02.119
in addition to even greater expectations
as Lady Gresham's heir,

45:02.200 --> 45:05.829
- to which it may be indelicate to refer.
- Oh, indelicate, yes.

45:05.920 --> 45:09.754
It's yours. If we marry, all of it, yours.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.873
Mr Wisley...

45:19.520 --> 45:25.709
Your offer is most sincere, I can see,
and gentlemanlike, and it honours me, truly.

45:27.400 --> 45:31.951
But for all you are, and all you offer, I...

45:34.080 --> 45:35.115
Yes.

45:45.840 --> 45:49.276
Sometimes affection is a shy flower
that takes time to blossom.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.710
Lying to tradesmen,
mending, scratching, scraping.

46:00.800 --> 46:04.076
Endlessly, endlessly making do!

46:04.160 --> 46:06.594
I understand
that our circumstances are difficult, ma'am.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.673
- There is no money for you.
- Surely something could be done.

46:10.760 --> 46:15.356
What we can put by must go to your brothers.
You will have nothing, unless you marry.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.910
Well, then, I will have nothing. For I will not
marry without affection, like my mother!

46:19.000 --> 46:22.117
And now I have to dig my own damn potatoes!

46:31.000 --> 46:36.597
Would you rather be a poor old maid?
Ridiculous, despised, the butt of jokes?

46:37.040 --> 46:41.397
The legitimate sport of any village lout
with a stone and an impudent tongue?

46:47.400 --> 46:50.949
Affection is desirable.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.914
Money is absolutely indispensable.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.038
I could live by my...

47:08.840 --> 47:09.909
Your what?

47:11.760 --> 47:13.751
- I could live by my...
- Pen?

47:14.760 --> 47:17.320
Let's knock that notion on the head
once and for all.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.674
What's this?

47:19.280 --> 47:22.317
Trouble amongst my women?

47:23.120 --> 47:24.235
Come,

47:25.360 --> 47:27.316
take hands and there's an end.

47:27.400 --> 47:30.790
- Where are you going? Miss!
- To feed the pigs, ma'am.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.950
He could give you a splendid home.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.790
- A comfortable life.
- Father.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.435
Consider.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.274
This is likely to be your best offer.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.074
Wisley?

48:03.600 --> 48:05.477
It is true, so far he has not impressed...

48:05.560 --> 48:08.791
- A booby.
- He should grow out of that.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.359
Nothing destroys spirit

48:26.000 --> 48:27.433
like poverty.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.675
I saw Queen Marie Antoinette
wear something the same at a ball once.

48:43.520 --> 48:47.115
Am I making a show? I am, I know.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.630
What trouble we take to make them like us
when we like them.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.515
Henry?

49:00.560 --> 49:05.031
- Eliza, my brother is much younger than you.
- And poorer.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.439
He knows that I care for him sincerely.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.792
I know that he is handsome...

49:12.880 --> 49:15.758
And the handsome young men must have
something to live on as well as the plain.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.990
You encourage him to take you for money?

49:18.080 --> 49:20.355
- Men do.
- That does not make it honourable.

49:20.440 --> 49:22.192
Well, I'm a sensible woman.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.628
I thank God I am not, by your description.

49:27.640 --> 49:31.076
If you were, you might have ascertained
that your Irish friend has no money, not a penny

49:31.160 --> 49:33.799
and could not be expected to marry without it.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.630
Consider that at the ball tonight.

49:38.120 --> 49:42.716
In any event, he'll be gone tomorrow back
to Bond Street where he can do no more harm.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.112
Good evening, Miss Austen.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.435
Yes, yes.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.995
Miss Jane Austen.

54:44.560 --> 54:45.629
Pleasure.

54:46.520 --> 54:49.592
We're very honoured
to be here at your aunt's ball.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.950
You dance with passion.

54:53.040 --> 54:57.909
No sensible woman would demonstrate passion
if the purpose were to attract a husband.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.476
- As opposed to a lover?
- Hmm.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.390
Rest easy, Mr Lefroy.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.835
- I have no expectation on either account.
- I did not mean to offend or hurt...

55:12.920 --> 55:17.277
Oh, no, no, of course not.
Excuse me, I'm just over warm.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.069
Pardon me.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.515
- Ah, Miss Austen.
- Excuse me.

56:06.120 --> 56:10.716
This is unbearable.
My father is pressing for an early ordination,

56:10.800 --> 56:16.113
while my own inclination is to the scarlet of
a captaincy in His Majesty's regulars.

56:16.200 --> 56:19.749
But I do not have the money to purchase one.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.314
I do.

56:24.120 --> 56:29.478
- Well, that, of course is impossible.
- Oh, Henry, do not disguise yourself, not to me.

56:33.560 --> 56:37.189
The scarlet will suit you very well.

56:39.040 --> 56:42.555
Miss Austen? There you are.

56:52.520 --> 56:56.877
Miss Austen, I cannot believe I am obliged
to have this conversation.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.309
Your Ladyship?

57:00.800 --> 57:04.793
Mr Wisley's mother,
my own dear sister, died young.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.837
I have no children of my own.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.395
I hope you never come to understand
the pain of that condition.

57:14.120 --> 57:19.353
Let us simply say my nephew's wishes
are close to my heart,

57:21.040 --> 57:23.315
however extraordinary they may be.

57:26.560 --> 57:27.595
Well,

57:28.840 --> 57:30.910
your health seems robust.

57:32.040 --> 57:34.508
You have the usual accomplishments.

57:35.640 --> 57:38.074
Your person is agreeable.

57:40.600 --> 57:45.674
But when a young woman such as yourself
receives the addresses

57:45.760 --> 57:51.073
from a gentleman such as my nephew,
it is her duty to accept at once.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.678
But what do we find?

57:55.560 --> 57:57.471
- Independent thought?
- Exactly.

57:58.760 --> 58:04.039
My nephew, Miss Austen, condescends far indeed

58:04.320 --> 58:08.871
in offering to the daughter of an obscure
and impecunious clergyman.

58:08.960 --> 58:12.475
Impecunious? Your Ladyship is mistaken.

58:13.160 --> 58:15.310
I am never mistaken.

58:16.280 --> 58:20.034
Your father is in grave financial difficulties.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.997
But all is not lost.

58:24.400 --> 58:28.029
He has a daughter
upon whom fortune has smiled.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.430
Mr Wisley is a good opportunity for Jane.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.950
She should accept him at once.

58:51.960 --> 58:54.520
Do not you think?

58:55.360 --> 58:58.318
- Lucy, let us take some refreshments.
- What? Mother.

59:23.840 --> 59:26.912
I have learned of Mr Wisley's marriage proposal.

59:28.480 --> 59:29.913
My congratulations.

59:30.480 --> 59:35.759
Is there an alternative for
a well-educated young woman of small fortune?

59:37.000 --> 59:38.718
How can you have him?

59:39.920 --> 59:41.876
Even with his thousands and his houses,

59:41.960 --> 59:46.033
how can you, of all people,
dispose of yourself without affection?

59:49.680 --> 59:52.274
How can I dispose of myself with it?

59:55.080 --> 59:57.116
You are leaving tomorrow.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.997
- Did I do that well?
- Very, very well.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.232
I wanted, just once, to do it well.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.317
I have no money, no property,

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.949
I am entirely dependent
upon that bizarre old lunatic, my uncle.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.431
I cannot yet offer marriage.
But you must know what I feel.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.198
Jane, I'm yours.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.556
Gah, I'm yours. I'm yours, heart and soul.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.636
Much good that is.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.556
Let me decide that.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.473
What will we do?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.668
What we must.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.109
<i>"My dearest Cassandra,
my heart has wings.</i>

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.794
<i>"Doubts and deliberations are ended.</i>

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.795
<i>"Soon I shall escape the attentions
of that great lady and her scintillating nephew.</i>

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.398
<i>"Eliza, Henry and I will join you at the coast,</i>

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.153
<i>"but we are obliged
to break our journey in London.</i>

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.789
<i>"Tom has cleverly secured an invitation
to stay with his uncle, the judge.</i>

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.633
<i>"Let us hope
we can convince him of my eligibility.</i>

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.517
<i>"Please destroy this disgraceful letter</i>

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.955
<i>"the moment you have recovered
from your astonishment.</i>

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.476
<i>"Yours affectionately, and in haste, Jane. "</i>

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.075
Tom! Our guests have arrived.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.835
Decorum.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.589
Countess.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.515
Sir.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.158
<i>- Welcome...
- Madame le Comtesse.</i>

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:32.110
<i>Madame le Comtesse. Seldom, too seldom,
my house receives the presence of nobility.</i>

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.155
And, of course, its friends. Please.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.318
Your stay is short. There's not a moment to lose.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.157
My nephew has devised a plan
of metropolitan amusement.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.713
<i>Pleasure is, as you would say, Madame, his forte.</i>

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.028
Ah, is it?

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.796
Which battle was it, Tom?

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.029
<i>Villers-en-Cauchies.</i>

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.716
Very good.
Thousands slain. Served those Frenchies out.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.952
Oh. Saving your presence, ma'am.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.998
Be not afraid of abusing
the Jacobins on my account, Judge.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.834
- They guillotined my husband.
- Oh, savages. Beasts.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.036
- And his property?
- Confiscated.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.795
A disaster.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.477
Of course, by then,
much of my wealth was portable, so...

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.755
Yes, portable property
is happiness in a pocketbook.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.829
Do I detect you in irony?

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.034
It is my considered opinion
that irony is insult with a smiling face.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.396
Indeed.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.515
No.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.595
No?

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.158
No, irony is the bringing together
of contradictory truths

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.195
to make out of the contradiction a new truth
with a laugh or a smile,

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.034
and I confess that a truth
must come with one or the other,

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.671
or I account it as false and a denial
of the very nature of humanity itself.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.349
My cousin is a writer.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.115
- Of what?
- Jane?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.555
Novels.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.954
A young woman of family?

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.832
Yes, uncle, and tomorrow
we go and visit another, Mrs Radcliffe.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.230
She keeps herself to herself, almost a recluse,
but I know her husband through the law.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.630
- Who?
- The authoress, Mrs Radcliffe.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.594
- As writing is her profession.
- Her what?

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.274
<i>£500, uncle, for the last novel,
The Mysteries of Udolpho.</i>

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.920
<i>- And £800, I believe, for her next.
- The Italian.</i>

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.036
Above £1,000?

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.791
The times, the times.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.594
You live so quietly.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.037
And yet your novels are filled
with romance, danger, terror.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.951
Everything my life is not.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.355
Apparently.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.997
Of what do you wish to write?

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.913
Of the heart.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.632
Do you know it?

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.159
Not all of it.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.998
In time, you will.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.072
But even if that fails,
that's what the imagination is for.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.271
Your imagination has brought you independence.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.749
At a cost to myself and to my husband.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.314
Poor William.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.953
To have a wife who has a mind
is considered not quite proper.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.999
To have a wife with a literary reputation
nothing short of scandalous.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.116
But it must be possible?

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.714
- To live as both wife and author?
- Oh.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.829
I think so.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.153
Though never easy.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.832
Could I really have this?

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.079
What, precisely?

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.314
You.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.474
Me, how?

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.237
- This life with you.
- Yes.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.554
Lefroy.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.790
- Hush. The judge.
- The man's like a rampant dog.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.000
He will be generous. I'm sure of it.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.555
- You'll speak with him?
- Tomorrow, I promise.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.835
I really must say good night.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.630
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.593
- Miss Austen?
- Yes?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.553
Good night.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.116
You know, I think my mother is right.
A husband, and the sooner, the better.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:39.473
Five girls of little fortune.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.790
<i>"... sensibly and as warmly as a man
violently in love can be supposed to do.</i>

01:08:55.279 --> 01:09:00.069
<i>"Mr Wickham was the happy man towards
whom almost every female eye was turned.</i>

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.957
<i>"... partial, prejudiced, absurd.</i>

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.957
<i>"Watch for the first appearance
of Pemberley Woods.</i>

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.430
<i>"The happiness which this reply produced...</i>

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.149
<i>"It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. "</i>

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.436
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning?

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.717
- Has the world turned topsy?
- Sir?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.318
I trust the countess is enjoying her visit?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.918
- I gather she is, sir. I...
- Fine woman, very fine woman.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.509
Indeed.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.710
- I'd hoped to discuss a certain matter.
- Your allowance is beyond negotiation.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.075
Now that you have had the opportunity
to become acquainted with Miss Austen yourself,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.551
I am sure you will find, as I do,
that she is a remarkable young woman.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.114
- This is an outrage!
- Lf you will allow me to speak, sir.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.749
There is no need.
This letter makes it absolutely clear.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.875
Letter?

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.077
Now I know what you were at down in Hampshire.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.272
- It is from Steventon.
- Is it true

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.635
that you have practiced upon me with this chit?

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.472
I wished you to know the young lady.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.516
I wished to introduce her
to your affections discreetly.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:21.119
Aye! Blind me with the rich widow and then
insinuate that penniless little husband-hunter!

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.875
- Moderation, sir, I beg you!
- That ironical little authoress.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.394
I wished you to know her for yourself.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.679
I was certain her merit would speak for her.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.629
- Consider, sir, my happiness is in your hands.
- Happiness?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.469
Damn it, nephew,

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.235
I had rather you were a whore-mongering
blackguard with a chance of reform

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.949
than a love-sick whelp sunk in a bad marriage.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.799
My uncle has refused to give his consent.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.957
- The letter has done its work.
- Who sent it?

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.353
Lady Gresham?

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.239
Or her nephew.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.473
They think that they can do what they like
with us, but I will not accept this.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.278
We have no choice.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.833
Of course we do.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.549
I...

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.472
I depend entirely upon...

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.356
Upon your uncle.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.479
Mmm.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.912
And I depend on you.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.077
So what will you do?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.399
What I must.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.558
I have a duty to my family, Jane.
I must think of them as well as...

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.675
Tom...

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.312
Is that... Is that all you have to say to me?

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.912
Goodbye, Mr Lefroy.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.389
The sentence of this court is that you be taken
to the place whence you came

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.756
and thence to a place of execution,

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.791
and that you be there hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.393
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.509
Next.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.359
He has behaved so ill to you, Jane.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.598
Perhaps soon we can return home to Steventon.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.791
Is there any news of Robert?

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.395
He has arrived in San Domingo at last.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.595
Good.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.675
Good.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.869
Glass of wine with you, sir?

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.515
Yes.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.231
Yes, a toast from one member
of the profession to another.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.070
I'm sorry to have been so disobliging in the past.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.153
Mr Wisley?

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.116
So, the infamous Mrs Radcliffe.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.273
Was she really as gothic as her novels?

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.236
Not in externals,

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.153
but her inner landscape is quite picturesque,
I suspect.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.719
True of us all.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.828
There's a message
for Reverend Austen.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.595
- Message for Reverend Austen.
- Thank you.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.514
Uncle?

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.553
What is it?

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.835
It seemed he died very soon
after landing in San Domingo.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.270
My God, he was hardly there.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.031
What was the disease?

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.909
Yellow fever. Lord Craven, he wrote.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.471
He said that if he had known
he was engaged to be married,

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.755
he would never have taken him.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.199
Jane, there's something else.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.110
Mr Lefroy, Tom.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.195
What?

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.838
I would keep this from you if I could.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.833
He's here visiting Mrs Lefroy and I...

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.552
He is engaged.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.789
So soon?

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.234
A letter?

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.595
No.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.634
It's something I began in London.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.752
It is the tale of a young woman.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.032
Two young women.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.236
Better than their circumstances.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.073
So many are.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.993
And two young gentlemen who receive

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.631
much better than their deserts
as so very many do.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.874
Mmm.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.798
How does the story begin?

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.793
- Badly.
- And then?

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.472
It gets worse.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.991
With, I hope, some humour.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.198
How does it end?

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.389
They both make triumphant, happy endings.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.152
Brilliant marriages?

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.470
Incandescent marriages

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.678
to very rich men.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.516
You asked me a question.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.951
I am ready to give you an answer.
But there is one matter to be settled.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.710
I cannot make you out, Mr Wisley.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.318
At times, you are

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.232
the most gentlemanlike man I know
and yet you would...

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.959
"Yet". What a sad word.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.630
And yet, you write yourself
most tellingly to great effect.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.237
- I'm speaking, of course, of your letter.
- What letter?

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.437
Was your aunt the correspondent on your behalf?

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.799
What matter?

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.115
One way or another,
passion makes fools of us all.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.509
I hope, in time,
passion may regain your better opinion.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.477
The emotion is absurd.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.153
When you consider
the sex to whom it is often directed,

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.515
indistinguishable from folly.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.399
I thank you for the honour of your proposal.
I accept. Good day.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.799
George, George.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.830
Mr Wisley is... He's an honourable man.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.990
You'll always have a place with me.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.719
Miss Austen.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.359
Mr Lefroy.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.115
Sir.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.550
I believe I must congratulate you, Mr Lefroy.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.034
And you've come to visit an old friend
at such a time. How considerate.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.317
I have come

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.198
to offer an explanation, belatedly,

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.068
for my conduct. I cannot think how to describe it.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.628
Tell me about your lady, Mr Lefroy.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.871
From where does she come?

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.910
She's from County Wexford.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.158
Your own country. Excellent.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.679
What was it that won her?
Your manner, smiles and pleasing address?

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.193
No, no, not at all.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:39.629
No, had I really experienced that emotion,
I should, at present, detest the very sight of him.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.517
And you are mistaken.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.912
I'm even impartial towards
the gloriously endowed Miss Wexford...

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.592
I cannot do this.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.276
And so you would marry Wisley?

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.232
Please?

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.159
If there is a shred of truth
or justice inside of you,

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.356
- you cannot marry him.
- Oh no, Mr Lefroy.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.273
Justice, by your own admission,
you know little of, truth even less.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.751
Jane, I have tried.
I have tried and I cannot live this lie.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.948
Can you?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.315
Jane, can you?

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.710
What value will there be in life
if we are not together?

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.677
Run away with me.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.758
An elopement?

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.910
That is exactly what I propose.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.397
We'll post to London,
by Friday be in Scotland, and man and wife.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.155
- Leave everything?
- Everything.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.389
It is the only way we can be together.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.556
You'll lose everything.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.478
Family, place. For what?

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.519
A lifetime of drudgery on a pittance?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.431
A child every year
and no means to lighten the load?

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.632
- How will you write, Jane?
- I do not know.

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.838
But happiness is within my grasp
and I cannot help myself.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.956
There is no sense in this.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.432
If you could have your Robert back, even like this,

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.072
would you do it?

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.714
- Please conceal my departure as long as possible.
- Wait.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.469
Here.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.635
Take these. Now go, quickly.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.669
Come. If we hurry,
we can still make the morning coach.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.274
You are sure?

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:03.994
Be careful.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.719
- Is it coming?
- Not yet.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.437
Take my hand. All right?

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.195
Hurry. I can hear it approaching.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.474
Here it is.

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.873
Whoa.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.990
Two to London. We'll settle at first rest.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.832
- Yes?
- Right you are, sir.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.430
Hampshire, your home county.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.274
It was.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.115
Stuck. Everybody out,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.229
- We need to lighten the load.
- No, let me, let me.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:34.110
I shall require you gentlemen
to give me a hand, put your shoulders into it.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:41.428
Now, sir, if you can push on the coach itself.
Excuse me, sir. Young gentleman?

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.353
- Yes, yes.
- You on the other side, sir, thank you.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.115
- Young gentleman, please come along.
- All right.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.509
Mind helping us? Thank you.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.480
Right, all together now then, sirs, please?

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.953
One, two,

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.352
and a three and push!

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.668
Come on.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.558
<i>"Dear Tom.</i>

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.793
<i>"How timely was the arrival
of the money you sent. "</i>

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.074
One, two and three!

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.276
<i>"It was so very much appreciated
by your father and I.</i>

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.997
<i>"You're so kind to share your uncle's allowance.</i>

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.514
<i>"Indeed, I do not dare think
how we would survive without it. "</i>

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.271
Well done. Thank you, sirs.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:42.078
All right, ladies and gentlemen, back on
the coach as soon as you can, thank you.

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.959
We are ready.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.230
- Worried?
- No.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.508
- Is it the loss of your reputation?
- No.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.919
The loss of yours.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.754
- I do not...
- Please, sir, come along, the coach is departing.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.989
Come.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.188
Changing horses.
Twenty minutes only.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.432
House of office at the back of the inn.
All down, quick as you like.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.475
How many brothers and sisters
do you have in Limerick, Tom?

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.835
Enough. Why?

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.719
What are the names of your brothers and sisters?

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.153
They...

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.670
On whom do they depend?

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.756
Your reputation is destroyed.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.670
Your profligacy is a beautiful sham.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.231
- I can earn money.
- It will not be enough.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.679
I will rise.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.075
With a High Court Judge as your enemy?
And a penniless wife?

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.118
God knows how many mouths depending on you?

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.911
My sweet, sweet friend,
you will sink, and we will all sink with you.

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.190
- I will...
Hampshire Flyer.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.999
Hampshire Flyer's leaving in five minutes.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.550
No! No, Jane.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.073
I will never give you up.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.039
- Tom...
- Don't speak or think.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.392
Just love me. Do you love me?

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.749
Yes.

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.195
But if our love destroys your family,
it will destroy itself.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.833
- No.
- Yes.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.753
In a long, slow degradation
of guilt and regret and blame.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.319
That is nonsense.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.634
Truth.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.472
Made from contradiction.

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:15.195
But it must come with a smile.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.677
Or else I shall count it as false
and we shall have had no love at all.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.476
Please.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.468
Goodbye.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.792
Typical bloody runaway. "Will I, won't I?"

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.315
Miss. Miss.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.552
All right, off you go.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.399
Hello?

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.308
- Where is everyone?
- Looking for you, Miss. Looking everywhere.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.311
- Thank you, Jenny.
- Mr Warren.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.875
Your family tried to keep the matter
from the servants, but...

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.995
Where is that blackguard Lefroy?
My God, if Henry finds him, he'll kill him.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.672
He won't find him.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.756
If he does, he won't kill him.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.752
There's no need.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.951
What happened?

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.712
Nothing happened.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.797
I see. I see.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.794
Jane,

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.831
I may have less personal charm than Lefroy.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.990
Superficial charm to some eyes.
To others, it is mere affectation, but I...

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.389
- I have no hopes.
- Hopes?

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.079
You cannot begin to imagine.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.557
Thank you for the great honour of your offer,

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.314
but are there no other women in Hampshire?

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.635
It was you who wrote the judge.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.510
You must consider
how much I have always loved you.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.319
Well?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.831
You came back to us.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.148
Leave it.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.753
Mr Austen, I must inform you
that I shall not attend service today.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.513
- Not in the presence of this young woman.
- Indeed...

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.636
- If I must speak plainly...
- Aunt.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.679
I believe your youngest daughter
has been on a journey.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.276
- Her Ladyship considers travel a crime?
- Unsanctioned travel.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.319
Furthermore, be aware that my nephew
has withdrawn his addresses

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.188
to someone without family, fortune, importance

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.316
and fatally tainted by suspicion.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.349
- Oh, she has family, madam.
Indeed she has.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.798
Importance may depend upon other matters
than Your Ladyship can conceive.

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.395
As to fortune, a young woman
might depend upon herself.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.109
An interesting notion, Miss Austen.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.919
Oblige me a walk along the river
to enlarge upon the topic.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.348
Wisley?

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.555
I am sorry if my conduct
has disappointed you, Mr Wisley.

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.554
It seems you cannot bring yourself
to marry without affection.

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.278
Or even with it.

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.719
I respect you for that
and share your opinion. Neither can I.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.278
I'd always hoped to win your love in time,

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.989
but I am vain enough to want to be loved
for myself rather than my money.

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.991
Do we part as friends?

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.273
We do.

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.914
- So, you will live...
- By my pen. Yes.

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.158
Will all your stories have happy endings?

01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.671
My characters will have,

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.475
after a little bit of trouble,

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.910
all that they desire.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.998
The good do not always come to good ends.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.073
It is a truth universally acknowledged.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.158
<i>"... that a single man
in possession of a good fortune</i>

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.958
<i>"must be in want of a wife. "</i>

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.038
<i>"However little known the feelings
or views of such a man may be</i>

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:30.395
<i>"on his first entering a neighbourhood,</i>

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:34.268
<i>"this truth is so well fixed
in the minds of the surrounding families,</i>

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.318
<i>"that he is considered as the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.</i>

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.472
<i>"'My dear Mr Bennet, '
said his lady to him, one day,</i>

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.472
<i>"'Have you heard
that Netherfield Park is let at last? '</i>

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.835
<i>"Mr Bennet replied that he had not.</i>

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.309
<i>"'But it is, ' returned she... "</i>

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.113
Is it Miss Austen? The Miss Austen?

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.510
No, Madam. That courtesy,
according to the customs of precedence,

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.511
belongs to my elder sister.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.195
<i>Miss Jane Austen,
the authoress of Pride and Prejudice?</i>

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:55.273
My sister wishes to remain anonymous,
but your kind regard is much appreciated.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.157
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.437
Please, come through.

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.959
I shall never forgive Henry for this.

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:37.032
Yes, you will.
We always forgive him for everything.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.949
Jane, an old friend.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.432
Late as ever.

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.555
<i>Madame le Comtesse, Miss Austen.</i>

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.319
Mr Lefroy.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.637
Please allow me to introduce to you

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.350
your most avid of admirers,
my daughter, Miss Lefroy.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.992
Miss Austen, what a pleasure to meet you.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.629
Will you read for us this evening?

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.188
Ah, well, you see, my sister never reads.

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:23.238
Otherwise, how else is she
supposed to remain anonymous?

01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:24.799
- But...
- Jane.

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.396
I will make an exception

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.270
if my new friend wishes it.

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.152
Come, sit by me.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.072
She is lovely, Tom.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.837
"She began now to comprehend

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.510
"that he was exactly the man who,
in disposition and talents,

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.712
"would most suit her.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.910
"His understanding and temper,
though unlike her own,

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.794
"would have answered all her wishes.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:17.395
"It was an union that must have been
to the advantage of both.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.516
"By her ease and liveliness,

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.115
"his mind might have been softened,
his manners improved,

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.475
"and from his judgment,
information and knowledge of the world,

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.076
"she must have received benefit
of greater importance.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.319
"But no such happy marriage
could now teach the admiring multitude

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.390
"what connubial felicity really was. "
