01:16.034 --> 01:17.077
Everybody up!

01:17.577 --> 01:18.912
Ah!

01:20.413 --> 01:22.540
No.

01:23.416 --> 01:27.212
Only a 99 on the test?
But I did all the extra credit.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.922
Come on,
it's time to wake up.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.089
Ah!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.467
What a nightmare.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.514
What's the point?
We're just floating in space.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.057
There's no day or night here.

01:39.474 --> 01:43.728
I have to agree with Lance.
We should sleep for 15 more doboshes.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.907
Guys, we can't let this long journey
make us soft or dull our skills.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.492
Routine will keep us sharp.

01:57.992 --> 02:01.121
Keith's right. Routine is what got me
through being Zarkon's prisoner

02:01.204 --> 02:03.665
and being in the infinite void
of the Black Lion.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.626
I guess that does make you
an expert on killing time.

02:07.001 --> 02:10.755
Okay everyone, to your stations.
Running battle simulations now.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.258
Can't we just have...

02:13.341 --> 02:16.177
Can't we just have
breakfast first?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.402
I programmed a new battle simulation.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.866
I think it's going to be
especially challenging.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.451
Why do you sound happy about that?

02:40.535 --> 02:42.287
Like mother like son.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.746
Focus.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.290
Here's the scenario:

02:45.373 --> 02:48.376
You're on a planet with double gravity,
dense volcanic fog,

02:48.459 --> 02:50.962
and eight blovar raptors are attacking.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.755
What do you do?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.008
This is a good one.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
Do these raptors have eggs?

02:57.093 --> 02:59.596
I say we steal some
and we make a little breakfast.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.597
Ah!

03:00.680 --> 03:03.141
A blovar raptor
just melted your face off, Hunk!

03:03.224 --> 03:04.601
Now it's eight on four.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.395
That's fine by me. I'm eating.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.540
Everyone split up to thin their numbers!
If there was just some way we could...

03:27.624 --> 03:29.125
What?

03:29.208 --> 03:30.335
Keith, you're out.

03:30.501 --> 03:34.339
Okay, I think I know what to do.
This place has thick volcanic fog, right?

03:34.422 --> 03:38.092
That means the blovars must use
some sort of thermal vision to see us.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.595
Maybe I can lure them away
with my heat rays.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.560
-It's working!
-Nice!

03:47.644 --> 03:49.520
Let's get them while they're distracted.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.941
Wait. What happened?

03:53.441 --> 03:57.111
You focused too much on
the raptors and forgot about the volcano.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.323
That fictional planet seems harsh.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.618
I programmed the simulator
to be unbeatable.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.995
I wanted to see how long you'd survive.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.914
Well, I hope you're happy.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.517
Food incoming!

04:28.768 --> 04:32.480
Aw, what a good wolf... fella... guy.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.692
Gosh, we really gotta come up
with a name for this wolf.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.151
Not gonna happen.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.070
Oh, come on!
I vote Kosmo.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.281
I like Kosmo.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.949
Kosmo is cool.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.535
Yeah, it's nice.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.787
We're not calling him Kosmo.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.456
Oh, come on, Keith,
we gotta call him something.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.875
I figure when he's ready,
he'll tell me his name.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.003
So, Kosmo. Got it.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.217
-Oh! Hunk, this is delicious!
-Yes, thank you, Lance.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.761
I made it by collecting fungus paste
from the dung of the beetles

05:03.845 --> 05:05.805
on that last planet we stopped at
to pick up supplies.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.516
Hunk, please!
I don't wanna know what it is.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.436
I just wanna eat it and pretend
that it's my meemaw's home cooking.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.563
A signal!

05:13.980 --> 05:16.691
- How did you get a signal?
- I've been running a passive scan,

05:16.774 --> 05:19.819
so I wouldn't give our location away,
looking for any signs of communications.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.405
-And I just picked up something!
-Well, what is it?

05:22.488 --> 05:23.823
I'm patching it through now.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.743
Bi-bi-boh!

05:27.118 --> 05:28.077
Bii!

05:28.411 --> 05:29.662
Boh-bi.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.289
Bii!

05:39.464 --> 05:42.425
That bii-boh-bi sold
the other's flizblaznator!

05:42.508 --> 05:44.552
These bii-boh-bis get comedy.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.804
Bi-bi-bi. Bi...

05:48.139 --> 05:49.140
Oh!

05:49.223 --> 05:50.058
Bii?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.517
Bi-boh?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.063
Biii!

05:55.146 --> 05:56.814
Oh!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.484
The drama caught me totally unaware.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.403
Wait, wh-- shh, shh, shh, shh.
What's that noise?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.075
It sounds like some interference.
I'll try to tune it out.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.659
No, wait.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.996
-Pidge, can you amplify that signal?
-On it.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.044
Oh, I wanted to know
what was going to happen.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.717
Judging from the intermittent
sound structure,

06:24.801 --> 06:26.803
it's just deep space interference.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.347
Most likely a radiation pulse
from a nearby star.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.724
No, that's just
what it's supposed to sound like.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.560
Listen to the sounds
in-between the pulses.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.187
There's a unique pattern.

06:41.984 --> 06:42.985
She's right.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.488
Before the Blades were unified,

06:45.571 --> 06:48.699
we would use this crude way
of communicating with each other.

06:49.158 --> 06:53.496
Not many Blades know this code.
It must be a senior member.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.622
Kolivan?

06:55.331 --> 06:56.457
Possibly.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.750
What does it say?

06:59.335 --> 07:03.005
It's a distress signal.
Whoever is sending it is in trouble.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.968
It looks like it's coming
from this sector.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.054
Do we know anything
about that section of space?

07:10.138 --> 07:13.057
Not without the Castle of Lions'
research library core.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.018
-We would be flying in blind.
-We must go!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.062
That's a pretty severe detour from Earth.

07:18.396 --> 07:21.524
If Kolivan is there,
then maybe there will be more Blades.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.193
We need all the help we can get
to reach Earth.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.748
The signal is coming
from this planet.

07:38.166 --> 07:42.170
I'm detecting remnants of a civilization,
but I don't see any signs of life.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.505
Is that a good
or a bad sign?

07:44.589 --> 07:48.384
In all my space experience,
there have never been any good signs.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.320
I still can't tell exactly
where the signal originates.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.739
I'll keep trying to triangulate
its location.

08:21.959 --> 08:26.130
The signs are all around us.
There was a massacre here.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.509
Some of this damage
looks like it's from magic.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.053
Everyone stay alert.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.445
These strike patterns
look Marmoran.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.780
Keep looking.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.533
We need to find whatever Blade
is broadcasting that signal.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.369
What is it?

09:07.630 --> 09:08.798
Good job.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.717
Who are you?
Who's broadcasting the signal?

09:12.134 --> 09:13.135
It was me.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.180
Impossible.
You're no Blade of Marmora.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.851
I will explain all
if you would put down your weapons.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.980
Let's see what he has to say.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.120
This place is disgusting.

09:39.203 --> 09:43.457
I have called this place home
for the past two deca-phoebs.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.253
Oh, well, "disgusting" is Altean
for "lovely."

09:47.336 --> 09:50.131
You don't speak Altean, do you?

09:50.214 --> 09:53.467
This is where the signal was coming from.
Somewhere below us.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.011
You are clever.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.889
But I wouldn't expect less
from the Paladins of Voltron.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.892
You recognized us?

10:02.351 --> 10:06.397
Of course, of course.
Though, I am surprised to see you.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.566
All were certain you perished.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.236
Yeah, we just found that out.
But we're back.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.531
And I am so grateful
that you are.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.368
It's been so long
since I've had... guests.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.122
Well, thank you for your hospitality,
but who are you?

10:23.205 --> 10:24.540
What happened here?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.709
Bloodshed happened here.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.171
Death happened here.

10:31.255 --> 10:34.383
I am Macidus.
This is my home planet.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.637
But now I am the only one
left alive here.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.811
What are you doing with these?

10:49.982 --> 10:53.110
I hang them
in honor of their sacrifice.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.489
They died trying to protect the universe.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.117
How did it happen?

11:02.036 --> 11:05.623
This all started
when Voltron disappeared,

11:05.706 --> 11:09.418
when-- when you disappeared.

11:10.961 --> 11:15.216
The power vacuum that ensued
destabilized much of the universe.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.968
Galra turned on each other.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.472
Warlords and pirates
became the rulers of the land.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.851
What happened with Haggar,
the witch?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.144
No one knows.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.899
But her Druids continued her work,
carrying out her final orders.

11:31.982 --> 11:35.152
They set out to destroy every Blade.

11:35.403 --> 11:40.199
After Lotor took over the throne,
almost every Marmoran agent was exposed.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.785
And that's
when the slaughter began.

11:43.285 --> 11:47.373
All Blades were called away from
their assignments and sent to this base.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.084
Kolivan knew
they were being hunted

11:50.167 --> 11:52.420
and he wanted to make a stand
against them.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.340
He believed it was
their only means of survival.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.136
That must be why they abandoned
that base we found.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.388
Indeed.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.600
When they arrived here,
my people helped them fortify their base,

12:06.684 --> 12:09.437
but the Druids found us
sooner than we hoped.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.106
They arrived without warning.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.152
The Druids encircled the base
and besieged it with magic.

12:16.861 --> 12:21.115
After a long battle of attrition,
the base fell.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.702
Casualties on both sides
were enormous.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.913
My people were the first
to try to escape.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.874
They were slaughtered.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.460
I stayed behind with Kolivan.

12:32.543 --> 12:36.130
He led those of us that remained
to battle the last of the Druids.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.467
But for each one
we managed to take down...

12:40.468 --> 12:42.970
nearly a hundred Blades would fall.

12:44.555 --> 12:49.185
In the final battle, I was buried
beneath a collapsed structure.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.395
When I regained consciousness,

12:51.479 --> 12:55.566
the fight was over
and I was the lone survivor.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.029
I've been sending the signal
Kolivan gave me ever since

13:00.112 --> 13:03.532
in the hopes of finding
any remaining Blades.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.035
There are still a few of us alive.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.412
Good.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.710
I recognize
every one of these Blades.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.421
I trained many of them myself.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.798
If I had only been here.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.302
Kolivan.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.142
Their service will not be forgotten.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.439
Kolivan?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.318
His blade, it's flickering.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.820
Flickering? What does that mean?

13:42.238 --> 13:45.574
A Marmoran agent's life force
is connected to their blade.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.869
I just saw it glow.
He must still be alive.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.955
Just barely.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.836
Your hand
is looking much better.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.631
My hand?

14:01.757 --> 14:04.134
You don't remember our fight?

14:17.648 --> 14:20.651
You've been using that signal
to draw Blades in!

14:27.533 --> 14:30.786
Kolivan proved to be useful after all.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.879
No!

15:03.485 --> 15:04.695
Where are we?

16:06.840 --> 16:07.675
Ah!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.532
There is no escape but death!

17:20.289 --> 17:21.290
Hyah!

17:23.125 --> 17:23.959
Huh?

17:26.502 --> 17:28.255
Hmm?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.139
Kolivan. I'll get you out of here.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.981
Our high priestess, Haggar,
has forsaken us because of your treachery.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.610
But after I kill you
and the other Paladins,

17:49.693 --> 17:53.197
Haggar will allow me to return!

18:00.204 --> 18:01.830
Ah!

18:42.663 --> 18:44.456
Allura, are you okay?

18:47.084 --> 18:49.336
Pidge, lock on to Keith's location!

18:51.588 --> 18:53.382
He's directly below us!

18:55.008 --> 18:56.468
Stand back!

19:10.440 --> 19:11.525
How?

19:18.866 --> 19:22.578
I'm going to enjoy making Kolivan
watch your end.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.251
Yah!

19:30.085 --> 19:31.420
Huh? Whoa!

20:22.471 --> 20:23.805
Good job, Keith.

20:24.848 --> 20:25.849
Yeah.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.478
I thought this was gonna end with my face
melted off, like in that simulator.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.371
He's in pretty bad shape,
but it looks like he's gonna be okay.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.456
I...

20:50.332 --> 20:53.043
I'm sorry my code lured you here.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.754
There was nothing you could do.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.006
The coordinates I gave you,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.342
the Altean colony,
were you able to find it?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.805
I sent a team.
There was nothing there.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.515
Just an empty facility.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.392
They were all gone.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.899
Judging from the Blades
that Macidus collected,

21:15.983 --> 21:18.610
he may have delivered a critical blow
to the Marmora,

21:18.694 --> 21:21.029
but he did not defeat us entirely.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.492
I must find the others.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.203
The universe needs us now
more than ever.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.374
I will join you.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.877
We will revive
the Blade of Marmora together.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.005
We'll just need to find a ship.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.800
The Druid has a cruiser stored
not far from here.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.052
We can use it to reunite the Blades.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.556
That's our first bit of luck
in a long time.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.851
Rest.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.154
Keith, I...

22:03.488 --> 22:06.825
I'm sorry to have to say goodbye to you
for a second time.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.869
It's not goodbye.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.079
Take this.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.583
You can return it
when we see each other again.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.221
Thanks for everything
you taught me, Mom.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.015
Keith.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.809
It's time to get going.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.563
I love you, Keith.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.524
I love you, too, Mom.

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
