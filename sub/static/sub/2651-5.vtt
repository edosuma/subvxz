00:04.322 --> 00:06.822
Why are there giant lollipops
all over the front yard?

00:07.022 --> 00:08.220
And why do they taste so bad?

00:08.420 --> 00:10.320
Because they're made out
of cardboard, mouth-breather.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.818
Hey! The world needs
more dreamers, Luke.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.219
Never stop licking things.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.618
I know it's lame, but after last year,
we promised the neighbours

00:17.618 --> 00:20.318
we would keep our decorations
more "family friendly".

00:20.318 --> 00:21.518
We can't even carve a pumpkin?

00:21.617 --> 00:23.018
The petition was very specific.

00:23.701 --> 00:25.922
Every Halloween,
we have the best house.

00:26.122 --> 00:28.621
Last year, I took things
to a whole new level.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.821
But, apparently, it was
too scary for some kids...

00:31.647 --> 00:32.698
And one adult.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.744
Trick-or-treat!

00:36.746 --> 00:38.665
Would you like some candy?

00:38.667 --> 00:40.045
Yeah!

00:40.045 --> 00:43.111
Or would you rather have this?

00:54.766 --> 00:56.232
Come on. You're fine.

00:57.342 --> 00:58.434
I don't care what anyone says.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.317
You did not give
that man a heart attack.

01:00.317 --> 01:01.033
Thank you.

01:01.034 --> 01:02.819
I mean, you're not even scary.

01:03.176 --> 01:04.316
Can I grab a little bit
of this candy

01:04.316 --> 01:05.391
for my open house tonight?

01:05.391 --> 01:06.689
Uh, yeah, sure, but...

01:06.690 --> 01:09.933
It's genius.
An open house on Halloween.

01:10.769 --> 01:11.908
Millions of bored parents

01:11.909 --> 01:14.535
just trying to keep their...
kids out of traffic.

01:14.536 --> 01:15.988
Now they can get away
from all that,

01:15.990 --> 01:17.714
and see a nice house.

01:17.714 --> 01:19.712
What do you mean,
I'm not even scary?

01:19.713 --> 01:22.712
I literally almost scared
the life out of a man.

01:22.714 --> 01:24.759
You literally scared
a little saliva

01:24.760 --> 01:26.012
and a little urine out of him.

01:26.013 --> 01:27.595
That happens to me
every time I see a monkey

01:27.597 --> 01:28.993
wearing people clothes.

01:28.993 --> 01:30.163
I was plenty scary.

01:30.165 --> 01:31.873
I used professional-grade makeup.

01:31.873 --> 01:34.867
That's the point, Claire.
It was overkill.

01:34.869 --> 01:36.551
You're the kind of person
who can be twice as scary

01:36.551 --> 01:39.009
without wearing any makeup.
Bye.

01:48.382 --> 01:51.881

01:52.652 --> 01:54.193
You remembered to pick up
the costumes, right?

01:54.194 --> 01:55.234
Yes, they're right over there.

01:55.234 --> 01:56.118
Very excited.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.894
Cam has lost a lot of weight--

01:57.894 --> 01:58.585
No.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.384
So we're throwing a Halloween party

02:00.385 --> 02:01.619
to debut the new him.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.615
I'll be dressed as a matador.

02:04.196 --> 02:05.456
Wh-what is it now, 30?

02:05.457 --> 02:07.689
- 32.4.
- Ah.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.162
So I've lost Lily.

02:10.366 --> 02:11.715
- Where is Lily?
- Hmm?

02:11.717 --> 02:13.046
- Do you-- you don't have her?
- No.

02:13.047 --> 02:15.208
- Why would I have her? I don't
have her in my pocket. - Cam?

02:15.210 --> 02:16.682
What about the tiara?

02:16.683 --> 02:17.622
Uh, we didn't buy one.

02:17.622 --> 02:19.145
You can just use
the one from last year.

02:19.146 --> 02:20.257
Are we poor?

02:20.258 --> 02:23.415
No, sweetheart, but
you don't need two tiaras.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.709
How 'bout next Halloween
you try a different costume?

02:25.709 --> 02:27.901
No. I have to be a princess.

02:27.902 --> 02:29.256
Every year? Why?

02:29.256 --> 02:31.148
Because my mom's a princess,

02:31.148 --> 02:33.135
just like you told me.

02:34.134 --> 02:36.131
Cam and I have always
known that someday,

02:36.132 --> 02:38.178
we were gonna have to have
the big talk with Lily

02:38.179 --> 02:40.429
about who her mom was.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.791
We--we were gonna
pick the right time

02:42.793 --> 02:44.632
and do it together,

02:44.633 --> 02:47.250
carefully following
an agreed-upon script.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.321
Then I got tired.

02:50.711 --> 02:52.584
"And she was the most
beautiful princess

02:52.585 --> 02:56.017
in all the land. The end."

02:56.328 --> 02:57.648
Again.

02:58.167 --> 03:01.296
Why is Tyler's mommy so fat?

03:02.238 --> 03:05.231
Oh, that's because she has--
she has a baby in her belly.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.443
Okay? Good night.

03:06.576 --> 03:09.944
Was I in my mom's belly?

03:10.096 --> 03:11.490
Lily, no more questions, all right?

03:11.490 --> 03:12.911
Just-- just go to sleep.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.424
Where's my mom now?

03:15.768 --> 03:17.567
Um, she's...

03:17.877 --> 03:20.014
In a faraway land.

03:20.423 --> 03:21.679
Why?

03:21.780 --> 03:24.403
Because she's a princess.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.612
And she's... very, very busy.

03:28.739 --> 03:30.189
Okay.

03:30.515 --> 03:32.388
I thought that she'd forget
about it by the next morning.

03:32.389 --> 03:34.015
I mean, I did.

03:34.485 --> 03:36.077
Oh, I knew I was
gonna have to tell Cam,

03:36.078 --> 03:37.369
and he was gonna be furious,

03:37.371 --> 03:39.906
but I was hoping that
he'd see the bigger issue.

03:40.072 --> 03:43.234
You know, I was really tired.

03:44.374 --> 03:45.941
Hey, Cam, you know
this whole thing

03:45.943 --> 03:48.164
about Lily wanting
to be a princess again?

03:48.165 --> 03:49.925
Well, I-I think it might be
because I let her believe

03:49.926 --> 03:52.311
- her mother was--
- This is a nightmare.

03:52.312 --> 03:55.379
- It was just a mistake.
- More like a disaster.

03:55.528 --> 03:58.290
They sent the matador costume
in your size,

03:58.448 --> 04:00.338
and the bull costume in mine.

04:00.339 --> 04:01.729
Oh. I didn't notice. Um...

04:01.731 --> 04:03.318
Now no one's gonna see my bod

04:03.320 --> 04:05.436
in this bulky bull costume.

04:05.438 --> 04:07.218
It was-- it was honestly a mistake.

04:07.219 --> 04:09.565
L-listen, um, you--you could do
that other thing that you thought of.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.213
You could put on
that gorgeous white suit

04:11.213 --> 04:13.077
that fits you so well now,

04:13.260 --> 04:14.443
and you could be Mr. Roarke,

04:14.444 --> 04:15.995
and Lily could be your tattoo.

04:15.996 --> 04:18.216
No! I have to be a princess!

04:18.219 --> 04:20.028
Oh, but, Lily,
you were a princess last year.

04:20.029 --> 04:23.462
No! You promised!
I'm being a princess!

04:24.332 --> 04:26.999
Why is she so obsessed
with princesses?

04:27.026 --> 04:27.966
Well...

04:29.092 --> 04:30.866
Like we weren't at that age?

04:30.868 --> 04:31.884
I mean...

04:34.324 --> 04:35.553
I'm not mad about the ticket.

04:35.553 --> 04:37.272
It's just the first time
I couldn't charm my way

04:37.274 --> 04:38.671
out of one of these things.

04:38.673 --> 04:40.570
The way I see it,
it's not a ticket.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.235
It's a conversation.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.046
No offense.
You don't need that siren.

04:44.047 --> 04:46.558
You could stop traffic just
getting out of that squad car.

04:46.559 --> 04:48.615
License and registration, please.

04:49.002 --> 04:50.134
I, uh...

04:50.985 --> 04:53.309
I'm no stranger
to the police academy myself.

04:53.309 --> 04:54.516
Seen all seven of them.

04:54.518 --> 04:56.436
Sir, no one's seen all seven.

04:56.438 --> 04:58.509
- Is this information accurate?
- Yeah.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.192
Uh, except for the weight.

05:00.192 --> 05:02.844
I thought they wanted to know
how much I could curl.

05:03.965 --> 05:05.902
I must be getting rusty
with my moves.

05:05.902 --> 05:07.069
Moves? What moves?

05:07.069 --> 05:08.581
You know, flash the baby blues,

05:08.582 --> 05:10.287
hit 'em with the devilish grin.

05:10.357 --> 05:11.703
In case of emergency, break glass

05:11.705 --> 05:13.064
and bust out the dimple.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.385
Hey, isn't that one
from the smallpox?

05:15.387 --> 05:17.810
'Cause I'm 100. Chicken pox.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.949
And it doesn't matter
where it's from.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.415
It always worked.

05:20.706 --> 05:21.377
Hey, mom.

05:21.379 --> 05:23.637
Manny, why are you coming back
from school so late?

05:23.637 --> 05:25.053
I got sent to the principal's office.

05:25.053 --> 05:26.903
Oh. I am sending him
an angry e-mail,

05:26.903 --> 05:29.153
- because I don't like when--
- No, no, no. It's not his fault.

05:29.153 --> 05:31.232
- What did you do wrong?
- Nothing.

05:31.232 --> 05:32.676
Oh, that's it. I'm calling him.

05:32.677 --> 05:34.957
- I hate when he tries to--
- Nothing on purpose.

05:34.957 --> 05:37.809
It was between periods,
right before this big test.

05:37.809 --> 05:39.417
I was clearing my mind
by practicing

05:39.417 --> 05:40.941
some of my Gene Kelly dance moves.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.837
- As one does.
- Right.

05:43.027 --> 05:45.541
And my umbrella accidentally
snagged the fire alarm.

05:45.541 --> 05:46.894
The principal thought
I did it on purpose

05:46.896 --> 05:48.966
- so we'd miss the test.
- But you didn't!

05:48.966 --> 05:50.238
That's it!
I'm going to his house!

05:50.239 --> 05:52.373
Mom!
You gotta stop doing this.

05:52.374 --> 05:53.730
I'm not sure if it's the pregnancy,

05:53.730 --> 05:56.028
which we both know
isn't your fault...

05:58.129 --> 05:59.492
But lately you've been
such a hothead.

05:59.494 --> 06:02.301
I am not a hothead!
I am Colombian.

06:02.303 --> 06:03.313
We get excited.

06:03.313 --> 06:05.634
My country is covered in coffee.

06:05.636 --> 06:07.819
Just like the Starbucks girl when
she got your order wrong?

06:07.819 --> 06:09.854
Half-caf, non-fat wet soy latte.

06:09.854 --> 06:12.119
How hard is that to hear?!

06:20.857 --> 06:22.493
You don't get to be
2-time nonconsecutive

06:22.495 --> 06:25.256
district salesman of the year
without thinking inside the box.

06:25.258 --> 06:27.764
That's right.
I said "inside."

06:27.960 --> 06:28.983
You know why?
'Cause while everyone's

06:28.984 --> 06:30.870
chasing each other around
outside the box,

06:30.870 --> 06:32.448
you know what the box is?

06:33.718 --> 06:34.783
Empty.

06:35.605 --> 06:38.597
Which brings us back
to our formal dining room.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.965
Now any questions?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.637
Can we have our candy now?

06:41.639 --> 06:42.709
Just as soon as we go over

06:42.711 --> 06:44.401
what you're gonna
tell your parents.

06:44.406 --> 06:47.739
- Now what was our style?
- Pre-war craftsman.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.623
Good, good.
And how many square feet?

06:49.623 --> 06:52.466
3,500.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.246
Still no trick-or-treaters?

06:55.247 --> 06:58.791
- Not yet. - Well, maybe people
are going out later this year.

06:58.926 --> 07:00.397
Well, the street's full of kids,

07:00.399 --> 07:03.271
but they're actively
detouring around our house.

07:03.805 --> 07:04.903
Move along.

07:12.412 --> 07:13.936
Who wants some candy?

07:13.936 --> 07:15.581
Plenty of name-brand...

07:15.581 --> 07:18.128
- Family-friendly candy right here.
- Oh! - It's a trap!

07:18.128 --> 07:20.901
No. I-- Ooh, how about you? Hey--

07:20.903 --> 07:22.398
You want some candy, right?
Come on,

07:22.399 --> 07:23.706
- have some candy!
- Mom! Mommy, she's got me!

07:23.708 --> 07:25.214
No, I don't-- I'm not trying--

07:25.215 --> 07:27.433
- My candy!
- Just leave it!

07:33.920 --> 07:36.902
Jay, you have to get ready
for Mitch and Cam's party.

07:36.904 --> 07:40.280
Gloria, does my skin
look looser to you?

07:40.280 --> 07:41.203
What?

07:41.273 --> 07:43.307
Maybe I should try some of that
fancy neck cream of yours.

07:43.309 --> 07:46.382
Don't you have some with specks
of diamonds in it or something?

07:46.803 --> 07:48.170
- Trick-or-treat.
- Trick-or-treat.

07:48.171 --> 07:50.245
You guys don't even have costumes.

07:50.459 --> 07:51.411
I'm a skeleton.

07:51.411 --> 07:52.652
And I'm--I'm a lemon.

07:52.654 --> 07:54.333
Aren't you too old
to be trick-or-treating?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.406
Aren't you too old
to be having a baby?

07:57.068 --> 07:59.134
Ah, you find that funny, lemon?

07:59.135 --> 08:00.643
Here's a better joke.

08:00.643 --> 08:02.831
Knock, knock. What's gone?

08:03.407 --> 08:05.418
Your candy!

08:08.334 --> 08:08.965
What was that?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.495
Some rude dummies,
that they think that they can--

08:10.495 --> 08:13.272
All right, listen.
Let's just calm down.

08:14.508 --> 08:15.391
Get ready for the party.

08:15.392 --> 08:16.903
Calm down what? Huh?

08:16.904 --> 08:18.834
You think I'm a hothead, like Manny?

08:18.834 --> 08:19.866
No!

08:20.222 --> 08:23.221
You can be emotional.
Volatile, maybe.

08:23.221 --> 08:25.455
Still, that's a far cry from--

08:25.512 --> 08:27.151
You put egg on my house,

08:27.153 --> 08:29.261
I kill what you love!

08:29.569 --> 08:31.044
Psycho.

08:31.888 --> 08:33.573
- Plush utility room?
- Yeah, right.

08:33.576 --> 08:35.214
I know a hall closet when I see one.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.692
And your dad never lies?

08:36.693 --> 08:37.426
What medical school

08:37.427 --> 08:39.359
did the great appliance doctor attend?

08:39.360 --> 08:41.664
- Hey, Delgado.
- Oh, no! Durkas!

08:41.666 --> 08:43.023
What I wouldn't give
for this umbrella to have

08:43.025 --> 08:44.111
Mary Poppins' powers.

08:44.113 --> 08:45.956
Oh, I pray he didn't hear that.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.150
Heard you pulled
the fire alarm today

08:47.151 --> 08:48.650
and got us out of that test.

08:48.848 --> 08:50.548
- Good job.
- Thanks, Mr. Durkas.

08:50.549 --> 08:53.020
You know what? You don't need
to call me that anymore.

08:53.154 --> 08:54.946
Anyway, we're all meeting
at the playground at 8:00

08:54.946 --> 08:56.459
and heading out,
if you want to join.

08:56.945 --> 08:58.245
You're totally going to that.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.027
Yeah, if you want
to ruin your reputation.

09:00.028 --> 09:01.731
You're finally gonna be in
with the cool kids.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.087
You need to talk
at the school assembly

09:03.088 --> 09:05.469
on Monday and apologize
to all the teachers.

09:05.469 --> 09:07.804
Teachers.
More like public sector parasites.

09:07.805 --> 09:11.153
- Be strong, Manny.
- Be smart. Adventures, parties.

09:11.154 --> 09:12.372
Juvie, heartache.

09:12.374 --> 09:13.105
Girls!

09:13.106 --> 09:14.637
But not the kind we want.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.246
They're all the kind we want.

09:16.350 --> 09:17.527
Mr. Dur--

09:17.869 --> 09:19.061
Conrad!

09:21.532 --> 09:23.941
Take one. I'm an egg donor.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.083
I love your costume, too, Cam.
Adora-bull.

09:27.084 --> 09:28.966
Oh, well, thank you.
It's all in fun.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.327
I half-wanted to wear
something tighter.

09:30.328 --> 09:32.116
- You know, I've been reducing.
- I can see.

09:32.117 --> 09:34.389
- Well, you say it like you can't.
- No, no, no. I totally can.

09:36.956 --> 09:38.451
Impressive, huh?

09:38.618 --> 09:40.565
Yeah. I'm--I'm gonna...

09:41.722 --> 09:42.931
- Hey, Cam.
- Mm?

09:43.043 --> 09:44.896
I'm hearing a rumor that
you keep flashing our guests.

09:44.897 --> 09:46.509
Oh, well, not in a perverted way.

09:46.510 --> 09:48.053
I just want people to see my body

09:48.054 --> 09:49.707
under this stupid costume.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.660
That's very close
to what actual flashers say.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.195
- Daddy?
- Yeah, one second, honey.

09:53.196 --> 09:54.430
I'm just tired
of throwing out compliments

09:54.431 --> 09:55.342
and not getting anything back.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.105
I told Roberto
his spray tan looked real.

09:57.106 --> 09:59.690
Look for yourself.
It's on two of our pillows and our cat.

09:59.691 --> 10:01.146
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

10:01.147 --> 10:03.743
Look it. It's my mommy. She came.

10:03.745 --> 10:06.050
Oh. Oh, no, honey,
that's not your mommy.

10:06.052 --> 10:09.124
- It's not? - No, no. That's
just one of daddy's friends.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.206
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.

10:10.206 --> 10:11.541
She just wants
one of these cupcakes.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.321
- But I already had--
- Oh, there you go, honey.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.540
Okay, off you go.
Mingle! Mingle!

10:19.257 --> 10:20.861
Looks like some people came by.

10:20.862 --> 10:22.498
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we had a few.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.743
I saw that.

10:25.763 --> 10:26.446
Hello?

10:26.447 --> 10:27.672
Hey, honey.

10:28.223 --> 10:30.056
Hi. How's your open house?

10:30.701 --> 10:32.404
Pretty empty, actually.

10:32.405 --> 10:34.911
I kind of just took it out
on a Harry Potter.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.147
Seriously, though, a Gryffindor

10:36.148 --> 10:37.826
letting his mom carry
his Quidditch broom?

10:37.828 --> 10:39.339
How Hufflepuff is that?

10:39.340 --> 10:40.852
It's pretty lonely here, too.

10:40.998 --> 10:42.649
We have been shunned
by the whole neighborhood.

10:42.650 --> 10:43.562
That's ridiculous.

10:43.563 --> 10:46.419
All over some mild
little gag you pulled?

10:47.049 --> 10:50.057
It was not mild.
There was an investig--

10:51.876 --> 10:53.421
Oh, I-I thought I heard someone.

10:53.422 --> 10:56.393
I guess it was just trees
tapping against the window.

10:56.774 --> 10:59.517
It's pretty creepy over here
in this rattly old house.

11:00.371 --> 11:02.420
Anyway, I'll probably
give it another 30 minutes,

11:02.421 --> 11:03.906
- then I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

11:03.908 --> 11:04.905
Bye.

11:06.226 --> 11:07.505
What are you laughing about?

11:07.505 --> 11:09.802
Oh, it's just your poor dad,
you know.

11:10.332 --> 11:12.086
Your poor, dumb dad.

11:21.865 --> 11:22.976
I'll fill you in at the staff meeting

11:22.977 --> 11:26.394
after Keneally's done telling us
about his morning commute.

11:26.707 --> 11:29.119
That's hilarious!
You sound just like him.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.773
You are so doing that
at Christmas talent night.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.464
Dude, "rich girl," "Sara smile"...

11:34.464 --> 11:36.651
Then a "maneater" encore.

11:36.872 --> 11:39.114
It was scary how good they were.

11:39.194 --> 11:41.273
Close your eyes,
it could have been the real band.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.530
Yeah, he got lucky
in the football pool once,

11:43.531 --> 11:45.625
and now he wants
to double the stakes.

11:45.626 --> 11:47.956
Oh, I'm so scared!

11:48.393 --> 11:49.652
Right?

11:50.649 --> 11:52.402
Well, this night was a bust.

11:52.459 --> 11:54.498
Not a single person even...

11:56.203 --> 11:58.228
Or did I speak too soon?

11:58.843 --> 12:01.973
Was someone in the mood
to be a bad little ghoul?

12:02.457 --> 12:05.187
Oh, Connie, I didn't mean you.

12:05.241 --> 12:08.595
I'm-- hey, that's just--
that's just the divorce talking.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.387
Hang in there.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.618
Bye-bye.

12:19.919 --> 12:21.047
Well, someone decided to take a trip

12:21.048 --> 12:22.650
to fantasy island after all.

12:22.651 --> 12:24.308
Well, I'm tired of people
not noticing my new physique.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.586
If this doesn't work,
I'm breaking out the diaper

12:25.586 --> 12:27.176
and top hat and going
as baby new year! Hello.

12:27.177 --> 12:29.388
Oh, my God!

12:29.389 --> 12:31.828
John-John, is that you?

12:31.829 --> 12:34.060
- You look amazing.
- Thanks!

12:34.061 --> 12:36.142
That's what happens
when you lose 100 pounds.

12:36.144 --> 12:37.517
Oh, come on. What a--

12:37.519 --> 12:38.808
- Who wants to lift me?
- Me.

12:38.809 --> 12:41.312
- Come on.
- How could he have not called us?

12:41.313 --> 12:43.437
Oh, my God,
he's as light as a feather.

12:43.453 --> 12:44.980
You know what?
I'm gonna go lift him

12:44.981 --> 12:47.459
- and shake him till his staples pop.
- Cam, stop!

12:47.460 --> 12:49.543
Just saying that we could
have caught those kids.

12:49.545 --> 12:51.347
What, and chase them
around all night?

12:51.348 --> 12:54.702
I'm not a young man anymore,
as the world keeps pointing out.

12:54.703 --> 12:56.227
What did that waiter
just call you outside?

12:56.227 --> 12:57.948
Medieval knievel.

12:58.140 --> 12:59.501
That is hilarious.

12:59.503 --> 13:01.349
I love when people put
some thought into their outfit.

13:01.350 --> 13:03.272
Illegal alien, sugar daddy.

13:03.273 --> 13:04.606
Why do you say "illegal"?

13:04.608 --> 13:06.254
Because antennas are alien,
and you're--

13:06.256 --> 13:07.772
What? Illegal?

13:07.772 --> 13:09.830
Because of the color of my skin?

13:09.830 --> 13:12.694
Why don't I dump
your baby in your gas tank?

13:12.694 --> 13:14.620
Gloria!
Uh, no hard feelings, please.

13:14.621 --> 13:16.295
Just enjoy the party, okay?

13:17.246 --> 13:18.856
First of all, relax.
We're at a party.

13:18.857 --> 13:21.183
Secondly, you've been deported twice.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.609
You're not allowed
to be that defensive.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.518
What is it with me lately?

13:25.519 --> 13:27.417
Manny's right.
I'm such a hothead.

13:27.419 --> 13:29.397
It happens. You're pregnant.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.906
That's what it is, isn't it?

13:31.977 --> 13:35.436
It's the baby.
It's angry in there.

13:35.437 --> 13:36.717
- No!
- Yes!

13:36.718 --> 13:40.067
You just said it yourself.
I have changed.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.902
I have an angry baby inside of me
making me do bad things!

13:42.902 --> 13:44.649
It's just hormones.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.353
It's your mama bear
instinct kicking in.

13:46.353 --> 13:48.281
And that's a good thing,
because that means

13:48.281 --> 13:51.059
you're gonna be
a great mom--again.

13:52.601 --> 13:53.578
Do you really think so?

13:53.579 --> 13:55.023
You got a lucky little kid in there.

13:55.024 --> 13:58.201
He's got a mom who's not gonna
let anyone harm him.

13:58.431 --> 13:59.513
Or her.

14:00.414 --> 14:01.615
Or--or him.

14:01.617 --> 14:03.090
- Trick-or-treat.
- Trick-or-treat.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.867
Go ahead.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.546
You better run!

14:13.222 --> 14:13.750
Oh, my gosh,

14:13.751 --> 14:15.634
is that the most precious thing
you've ever seen?

14:15.635 --> 14:16.941
Oh, my God.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.777
Do you know other princesses?

14:19.778 --> 14:21.171
Trust me. I know lots.

14:21.172 --> 14:22.329
Okay. Bedtime.

14:22.330 --> 14:23.756
Oh, no, it's not that late.

14:23.757 --> 14:26.505
Do you know my mom?
She's a princess.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.419
She's exhausted.

14:27.420 --> 14:29.257
She's not making sense.
She's so tired.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.809
Daddy, you told me!

14:30.810 --> 14:32.342
What is she talking about, Mitchell?

14:32.342 --> 14:34.645
My real mom. She is, right?

14:34.646 --> 14:37.007
Okay, I think we need
to have a little talk.

14:37.403 --> 14:39.465
Sam, do you notice
how slim Cam's getting?

14:39.465 --> 14:41.810
Nice try.
I will be back for that answer.

14:46.103 --> 14:47.697
This isn't gonna work, Claire...

14:48.630 --> 14:49.983
'Cause I know you're here.

14:52.357 --> 14:54.062
What's the plan, anyway?

14:54.533 --> 14:56.110
You gonna pop out at me?

14:56.484 --> 14:58.055
It's gonna take more
than that to scare this--

14:58.056 --> 14:59.682
- Hello?!
- Hi!

14:59.815 --> 15:03.686
- Is the house still open?
- Oh, yes! Yes! I'll be right down.

15:03.687 --> 15:05.680
Claire, this is serious!
I have a job!

15:06.022 --> 15:07.617
Not that you don't.
You work 24/7

15:07.618 --> 15:09.347
and you don't get
half the appreciation you deserve.

15:09.347 --> 15:10.845
Can we talk about this later?

15:11.121 --> 15:13.283
As you potential buyers can see,

15:13.283 --> 15:15.679
this is a, uh, a beautiful home.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.604
- What's behind here?
- Oh, I wouldn't go in there!

15:18.378 --> 15:21.619
Unless you love
formal dining rooms.

15:22.685 --> 15:24.315
- Honey, look at this.
- I'm in the kitchen.

15:24.317 --> 15:26.678
Oh, we should probably
stay together.

15:26.868 --> 15:27.997
Come on, Sheila.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.947
- Phil, one question. Are these--
- Wait, wait.

15:29.948 --> 15:31.766
I just love to see
people's reactions

15:31.768 --> 15:32.806
when I show them--

15:32.807 --> 15:35.664
so much storage.
What? It's crazy!

15:36.166 --> 15:37.643
I think you guys will
find that this house

15:37.643 --> 15:41.093
is full of so many...
delightful surprises

15:41.093 --> 15:42.516
that you'll be happy here for--

15:42.517 --> 15:44.493
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know her!

15:44.644 --> 15:46.102
Is this the original tub?

15:46.103 --> 15:48.231
What?
Yes, it is.

15:48.232 --> 15:49.883
It is, uh, the original tub.

15:49.884 --> 15:52.171
Um, original fixtures,
beveled mirror,

15:52.172 --> 15:53.873
just a-a huge stall shower

15:53.874 --> 15:56.043
if you guys would, uh,
want to have a party.

15:56.045 --> 15:57.254
I'm kidding, of course.

15:57.256 --> 16:00.801
But, um, just a house
with a real personality.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.392
We'll be right in, sweetie.

16:05.635 --> 16:07.513
We agreed to tell Lily
about her mother together,

16:07.514 --> 16:08.711
wearing calming earth tones,

16:08.712 --> 16:10.577
and we agreed
to tell her the truth.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.668
I know, but haven't you ever
said something dumb to Lily

16:12.669 --> 16:14.085
that you wish
she would just forget?

16:14.085 --> 16:16.459
This isn't about me.
Let's just fix this.

16:16.459 --> 16:18.325
Okay, great.
Although...

16:19.068 --> 16:20.510
The way you agreed
so quickly makes me wonder

16:20.511 --> 16:22.108
what sort of things
you've told her.

16:22.108 --> 16:24.164
I may have told her
her fibs kills birds.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.707
Wow. We're coming back to that one.

16:27.994 --> 16:29.244
Oh, hi, princess.

16:29.245 --> 16:31.603
Hey, Lil.
Could we talk to you for a second?

16:31.604 --> 16:32.864
Am I in trouble?

16:32.865 --> 16:35.658
Oh, gosh, no.
Of course not, sweetie.

16:36.001 --> 16:38.633
Um... well, do you remember
how we used to tell you

16:38.634 --> 16:40.844
there was a heaven
for all the flowers that die?

16:40.846 --> 16:42.017
What do you mean, "used to"?

16:42.018 --> 16:43.842
Sorry, I let it slip.
We'll deal with it later.

16:43.843 --> 16:45.260
How much are you not telling me?

16:45.261 --> 16:47.384
Why are you talking like this?

16:47.384 --> 16:48.418
Daddies took a little side trip.

16:48.419 --> 16:51.474
- Sorry, sweetie.
- Um, so sometimes, uh,

16:51.475 --> 16:54.396
- we tell you things like that
to make you feel better. - Mm-hmm.

16:54.441 --> 16:57.209
And I might have done
the same thing

16:57.210 --> 16:59.828
when I told you that
your mom is a princess.

17:00.873 --> 17:03.632
So she's not?

17:04.167 --> 17:05.499
Well, you know what?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.380
- She might be.
- She might be.

17:07.499 --> 17:09.231
But we can't know for sure, honey,

17:09.232 --> 17:12.886
because... well,
we don't know where she is

17:12.887 --> 17:15.444
or... what she's doing.

17:15.445 --> 17:16.844
B-but what--
what we do know

17:16.844 --> 17:18.758
- is that she loved you very, very much...
- Mm-hmm.

17:18.759 --> 17:20.458
And she knew that she
couldn't take care of you,

17:20.459 --> 17:22.546
so she made sure that you went

17:22.547 --> 17:25.228
with the most loving family
she could find.

17:25.954 --> 17:28.640
And that's how the three of us
became a family.

17:28.641 --> 17:30.314
Does that make sense, sweetie?

17:31.334 --> 17:33.067
Do you have any questions for us?

17:33.105 --> 17:36.573
Why did you say
a fib and kill a bird?

17:39.378 --> 17:41.358
I noticed you walking
in with your wife earlier.

17:41.359 --> 17:42.280
She's stunning.

17:42.281 --> 17:43.801
You know my favorite part
of that compliment?

17:43.802 --> 17:44.866
You knew she was my wife.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.660
Half the world thinks
she's my daughter.

17:46.661 --> 17:49.188
Well, if you ask me,
she's a lucky girl.

17:49.189 --> 17:50.510
Bummer for me, though.

17:50.511 --> 17:52.846
Handsomest man in here,
and he's taken.

17:52.847 --> 17:54.777
I'll bet you do
all right with the boys.

17:55.872 --> 17:56.953
I do.

17:57.295 --> 17:58.929
It's the men I'm interested in.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.617
You just put it all right
out there, don't you?

18:00.618 --> 18:03.266
I always try to hold
a little something back.

18:04.833 --> 18:05.608
Oh, my gosh.

18:05.609 --> 18:07.514
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Leave him.

18:07.515 --> 18:10.630
- No, but you know that's a--
- I know. He needs this. - Okay.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.990
- It was great meeting you, Jay.
- You, too, Sam.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.388
Wow! Looks like somebody
really likes you.

18:15.389 --> 18:16.976
What can I say? I still got it.

18:16.977 --> 18:18.991
I've been meaning to ask you--
have you lost some weight?

18:18.992 --> 18:21.454
- Because you look good.
- Wow, you have no idea

18:21.455 --> 18:23.058
what that means
to hear from you, Jay.

18:23.059 --> 18:24.685
Uh, turn it that way.

18:24.748 --> 18:26.533
I thought this might cheer you up.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.836
Da plane! Da plane!

18:28.978 --> 18:30.603
- Baby girl!
- Ohh!

18:30.636 --> 18:32.811
Look you! You even
taught her the catchphrase.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.128
Yeah. Jay, have you seen
my new tattoo?

18:35.129 --> 18:36.635
...Be in touch.
Well, thanks so much for coming.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.214
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.

18:43.051 --> 18:45.987
Okay, Claire, they're gone.
You can come out now.

18:47.688 --> 18:48.771
Claire?

18:49.416 --> 18:51.791
Honey, I'm sorry I said
you weren't scary.

18:51.791 --> 18:53.394
It's been such a long day.

18:53.395 --> 18:55.213
Can we please just go home?

19:01.490 --> 19:04.332
All right.
I'm leaving without ya.

19:21.933 --> 19:25.926
So... this remote
you know how to use.

19:41.239 --> 19:41.790
Yes?

19:41.791 --> 19:43.210
Phil, where are you?

19:43.359 --> 19:45.657
Claire? Where are you?

19:45.790 --> 19:47.720
I came over to scare you,
but then I heard you

19:47.721 --> 19:49.114
showing the house to that couple,

19:49.115 --> 19:50.740
so I got out of your way.

19:51.771 --> 19:52.684
Are you at home?

19:52.685 --> 19:54.647
Yeah.
I got here ten minutes ago.

19:54.734 --> 19:57.510
S-so... so you're saying...

19:58.060 --> 20:01.361
This call isn't coming
from inside the house?

20:01.362 --> 20:02.966
What are you talking about?
Just get home.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.436
The kids and I are hungry.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.706
Yeah, hurry up, dad.

20:05.707 --> 20:06.954
We miss you!

20:08.521 --> 20:10.002
Miss you, too, buddy.

20:47.431 --> 20:49.008
- Trick-or-treat!
- Aah!

20:52.116 --> 20:53.791
I wasn't really that scared.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.447
Okay.

21:03.301 --> 21:05.683
Hey, you never told me if
you hit those kids with that egg.

21:05.684 --> 21:06.823
They blended into the crowd,

21:06.823 --> 21:08.867
but there was a slow one with them.

21:08.868 --> 21:09.967
He couldn't run so fast,

21:09.967 --> 21:12.152
and I nailed him pretty good.

21:12.526 --> 21:14.857
I warned you.
Okay, Reuben.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.456
Where are your cool friends now?

21:16.456 --> 21:18.407
Not q-tipping your ear,
that's for sure.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.131
Okay, Reuben.

21:20.215 --> 21:22.053
This is why I never
hang out with cool kids.

21:22.054 --> 21:23.635
Yeah, you rejected them,

21:23.636 --> 21:24.678
shortly after you and your mom

21:24.679 --> 21:26.319
roller danced at the talent show.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.614
Oh... we were robbed.

21:27.615 --> 21:29.049
Couldn't have been
the song you picked.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.756
"Wing beneath my w--" ow!

21:30.955 --> 21:38.653
