WEBVTT

00:08.151 --> 00:09.085
[laughing]

00:09.120 --> 00:09.718
It's gonna be great.

00:09.754 --> 00:10.386
I can't wait.

00:10.421 --> 00:11.020
Bye!

00:11.055 --> 00:12.288
Bye.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.287 --> 00:43.685
Here we go.

00:54.732 --> 00:55.697
Bubba!

00:55.733 --> 00:57.699
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

00:57.735 --> 00:59.735
The best part of my day.

01:24.028 --> 01:25.794
<i>Hey Martin, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>I missed you again.</i>

01:25.830 --> 01:27.296
<i>You'd love this house.</i>

01:27.332 --> 01:29.198
There are even bookshelves
in the kitchen

01:29.233 --> 01:31.334
so of course I had to buy it.

01:31.369 --> 01:33.102
I uh, signed the closing papers

01:33.137 --> 01:36.072
and I picked up the keys this
morning and I move in next week.

01:36.107 --> 01:37.906
And you had told me to-
to let you know,

01:37.976 --> 01:40.009
so I'm- I'm letting you know.

01:40.078 --> 01:45.647
And I uh, hope that you're doing
well at your new post.

01:45.683 --> 01:47.283
Take care, Martin.

01:53.157 --> 01:54.923
You still miss him,
don't you?

01:54.959 --> 01:59.428
[sighs]
So much.

01:59.464 --> 02:02.598
I can't believe he went back
to the CIA.

02:02.633 --> 02:06.268
I know he wants to serve
his country but I...

02:06.304 --> 02:08.270
I just keep thinking
that he's gonna call me

02:08.306 --> 02:12.041
and tell me he made a mistake
and he'll be on his way home.

02:14.178 --> 02:17.346
Maybe we were really mismatched.

02:17.382 --> 02:19.448
The librarian and the spy?

02:19.484 --> 02:23.886
Sounds like the title
of a bad novel.

02:23.921 --> 02:27.656
I thought you two
were a fabulous match.

02:27.725 --> 02:30.426
Yeah, we really were,
weren't we?

02:31.462 --> 02:33.095
[message alert]

02:33.131 --> 02:35.531
[laughs]

02:35.566 --> 02:37.733
It's Poppy again.

02:37.801 --> 02:39.268
She's coming over in a bit.

02:39.303 --> 02:41.937
What could possibly be wrong
with the condo now?

02:41.972 --> 02:43.872
Well, you have to admit,
mother.

02:43.908 --> 02:45.207
Life's gotten a lot more
interesting

02:45.243 --> 02:47.243
since Poppy came back to town.

02:49.780 --> 02:52.915
So um... I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it

02:52.950 --> 02:54.783
to your awards dinner tonight.

02:54.818 --> 02:56.085
I'm sorry, Dustin...

02:56.120 --> 02:59.621
Wait a minute,
you're not coming?

02:59.657 --> 03:01.890
I just don't think I should,
especially after-

03:01.926 --> 03:03.225
No, no, no.

03:03.261 --> 03:05.394
Poppy, you have to come.

03:05.463 --> 03:07.029
Ok? Please?

03:07.065 --> 03:10.732
It means a lot to me
to have you there.

03:10.768 --> 03:12.034
Ok. I'll come.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.335
Um, but I'll meet you there.

03:13.371 --> 03:14.603
No, I'll just-
I'll just pick you up.

03:14.638 --> 03:16.072
No, I'll just meet you there.

03:16.107 --> 03:17.173
Um, I have to go now.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.340
I have a lot of things to do.

03:18.376 --> 03:20.976
I'm- I'm on my way
to Aida's house.

03:21.011 --> 03:22.378
Ok.

03:25.550 --> 03:27.116
Bye.

03:31.622 --> 03:33.322
I'll see you tonight.

03:36.461 --> 03:38.060
[sighs]

03:39.130 --> 03:40.496
Look at this.

03:40.531 --> 03:42.198
I bet it's expensive.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.165
Let me guess. For Dustin.

03:43.201 --> 03:44.100
From the mayor.

03:44.168 --> 03:45.301
Mmm.

03:45.336 --> 03:46.635
You know that homeless family

03:46.670 --> 03:48.704
that Dustin just did
the story on?

03:48.739 --> 03:49.705
Mmmhmm.

03:49.740 --> 03:51.173
They moved into
their own apartment.

03:51.209 --> 03:52.874
I read his follow-up.

03:52.943 --> 03:53.976
We're so proud of him.

03:54.011 --> 03:54.977
So proud.

03:55.045 --> 03:56.044
Here he comes.

03:57.081 --> 03:59.615
Hi Dustin.
Another gift.

03:59.650 --> 04:01.317
Dustin?

04:01.385 --> 04:03.352
Maisey's talking to you.

04:03.387 --> 04:04.353
What?

04:04.388 --> 04:06.622
Just another gift.

04:06.657 --> 04:08.090
Oh, oh. Yeah.

04:08.126 --> 04:09.091
Thank you, Maisey.

04:09.127 --> 04:11.327
I'll just put that on your desk.

04:11.362 --> 04:12.194
Great. Thanks.

04:12.230 --> 04:13.429
Hey Sally.

04:13.464 --> 04:16.064
Taking our hometown hero
here out to lunch, so...

04:16.100 --> 04:17.199
Oh, ok, I'll grab my bag.

04:17.235 --> 04:18.399
I just need you to answer
the news lines

04:18.469 --> 04:20.202
while we're gone.

04:20.271 --> 04:21.870
[chuckles]
Great job.

04:21.904 --> 04:23.339
Of course.

04:27.011 --> 04:28.210
Well, it was driving
me crazy,

04:28.246 --> 04:30.112
the drip, drip, drip.

04:30.181 --> 04:32.148
Well, if you had called me I
would have had a plumber there

04:32.183 --> 04:33.282
in an hour.

04:33.317 --> 04:34.617
I know, but it was late.

04:34.652 --> 04:36.084
I got out my tool box and...

04:36.120 --> 04:38.220
That's my girl.

04:38.256 --> 04:40.122
I used to refuse to tie
her shoes for her.

04:40.158 --> 04:41.157
I'd always tell her-

04:41.225 --> 04:43.025
To rely on myself
not other people.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.194
Best thing anyone
ever taught me.

04:45.229 --> 04:49.532
Anyway, I found an instructional
video and I followed it exactly.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.701
Except for the part about
shutting the water off first.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.270
But I cleaned up
all of the water

04:54.305 --> 04:56.905
so the floor boards near
the sink weren't warped at all.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.141
Except for maybe
one tiny corner.

04:59.177 --> 05:00.909
Or two.

05:00.944 --> 05:05.614
Please tell me you don't regret
renting your condo to me, Aida.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.916
Your mother was one
of my dearest friends.

05:07.951 --> 05:10.419
I'm happy to keep a roof
over your head.

05:10.454 --> 05:11.887
And if I'm gonna keep
a floor under your feet

05:11.955 --> 05:13.989
I better call my handyman.

05:17.195 --> 05:18.327
You think she's mad at me?

05:18.362 --> 05:20.496
Oh, that's just
her landlady face.

05:20.531 --> 05:22.364
She knows repairs
come with renting.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.333
Well, I am gonna make
that condo famous.

05:24.368 --> 05:27.035
Cara and I have been making more
videos for our YouTube channel.

05:27.104 --> 05:28.737
You want to see the latest?

05:28.772 --> 05:30.206
Yes.

05:31.309 --> 05:33.342
â™ª

05:33.377 --> 05:34.976
Hi everyone.

05:35.012 --> 05:36.679
It's Poppy Wilson with another
great way you can use embroidery

05:36.714 --> 05:38.681
to make your wardrobe pop.

05:38.716 --> 05:40.516
<i>You've probably noticed</i>
<i>a ton of celebrities</i>

05:40.585 --> 05:42.585
<i>wearing bomber jackets</i>
<i>this season.</i>

05:42.620 --> 05:43.686
One of the reasons?

05:43.721 --> 05:45.254
Embroidered patches.

05:45.289 --> 05:46.788
Right Cara?

05:46.824 --> 05:48.224
Right Poppy.

05:48.259 --> 05:51.893
And um, you can embroider
any kind of design you like.

05:51.962 --> 05:54.096
Like I made these suns here.

05:54.131 --> 05:57.165
<i>I am all about flowers,</i>
<i>so here is my jacket.</i>

05:59.604 --> 06:00.769
Cute.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.037
<i>Now I have a totally</i>
<i>unique jacket</i>

06:02.072 --> 06:03.739
<i>that no one else</i>
<i>in the world has.</i>

06:03.774 --> 06:04.873
That is awesome.

06:04.908 --> 06:06.609
You're a natural in front
of the camera.

06:06.644 --> 06:07.809
Thank you.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.911
Ok Poppy, the handyman
will be at your place

06:09.947 --> 06:11.179
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

06:11.215 --> 06:12.314
That works.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.182
This video already has a ton
of views.

06:14.252 --> 06:17.119
My editor said I'm starting
a new modern embroidery craze.

06:17.187 --> 06:18.320
There's a craze?

06:18.356 --> 06:19.488
And when we get our book
published this year

06:19.523 --> 06:21.357
we will own the embroidery niche

06:21.392 --> 06:23.459
by making it cool
and contemporary.

06:23.527 --> 06:26.128
From there we can start
with knitting and crochet.

06:26.163 --> 06:28.664
We'll have a needle arts empire.

06:28.733 --> 06:29.965
I wish your mom
were around to see

06:30.033 --> 06:31.634
how well you're doing
for yourself.

06:31.669 --> 06:33.535
Well, daddy says
she's my guardian angel

06:33.604 --> 06:36.372
so maybe she can see.

06:36.407 --> 06:37.273
Now, I should go.

06:37.341 --> 06:38.540
I'm meeting a publicist.

06:38.576 --> 06:40.376
My editor wants me to get
on some morning shows.

06:40.444 --> 06:41.843
Wow.

06:44.482 --> 06:45.781
Thank you for sending someone
to take a look at the floors.

06:45.816 --> 06:48.150
I am happy to pay
for the damages.

06:48.185 --> 06:49.585
Or at least my dad will be.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.786
I'll send the bill to Marv.

06:50.854 --> 06:52.220
Oh, if you do, send it
to his office

06:52.256 --> 06:53.355
otherwise my stepmother
might see it

06:53.391 --> 06:55.223
and she'll throw it out.

06:55.826 --> 06:57.092
Bye!

06:57.127 --> 06:58.494
I'm still helping you move
into your new house

06:58.529 --> 06:59.695
next Saturday, right?

06:59.730 --> 07:01.297
I could definitely use the help.

07:01.332 --> 07:03.799
I am so glad I moved back.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.133
I still don't know
why my dad thought

07:05.169 --> 07:07.002
he had to move us away
after mom died.

07:07.037 --> 07:09.271
I love that you're back.

07:09.307 --> 07:10.572
So I'll see you
and Dustin tonight?

07:10.608 --> 07:11.640
At the dinner?

07:12.743 --> 07:15.944
Yeah, um... we kinda
had an argument.

07:15.979 --> 07:17.279
Oh no.

07:17.348 --> 07:18.314
I'm sorry.

07:18.349 --> 07:19.848
Did you guys break up?

07:19.883 --> 07:21.417
No...

07:21.452 --> 07:22.584
Oh.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.586
Well, the award's kind of
a big deal.

07:24.655 --> 07:26.221
Sally's a little jealous.

07:27.792 --> 07:28.624
Well, I'll be there.

07:28.659 --> 07:29.858
Ok.

07:29.893 --> 07:30.726
Ciao.

07:30.761 --> 07:32.127
Bye.

07:41.104 --> 07:44.039
If that's for Dustin
his desk is back there.

07:44.074 --> 07:46.208
Too heavy and too far.

07:46.243 --> 07:47.676
I don't know why the realtor's
association

07:47.745 --> 07:50.579
can't just say "congratulation"
with a balloon bouquet.

07:50.614 --> 07:52.013
Ooh, is that dark chocolate?

07:52.049 --> 07:53.782
Ah ah, not yours.

07:54.652 --> 07:56.117
Killjoy.

07:56.153 --> 07:58.654
And here I was thinking of
asking you to be my plus one

07:58.689 --> 07:59.888
for the dinner tonight.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.423
Oh, well I'm already my mother's
plus one.

08:01.459 --> 08:03.692
But you have to sit with me
at the newspaper table

08:03.728 --> 08:05.561
so I don't have to talk
to Dustin's date.

08:05.596 --> 08:06.662
You mean Poppy?

08:06.697 --> 08:07.596
I thought you liked her.

08:07.631 --> 08:08.831
I do like her.

08:08.899 --> 08:10.632
Which is why if I end up
talking to her

08:10.668 --> 08:14.102
I'll probably start telling her
things that I shouldn't.

08:14.137 --> 08:15.404
Such as...?

08:15.439 --> 08:16.739
[sighs]

08:16.774 --> 08:18.674
Ok, you know my cousin Lizzy
is getting married?

08:18.709 --> 08:20.876
Right. To Bubba Rankart,
my mother's lawyer.

08:20.944 --> 08:23.278
Right. Well Bubba
is Poppy's lawyer, too.

08:23.313 --> 08:24.446
For her business.

08:24.515 --> 08:25.914
Mmm. Which is taking off
in a really big way.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.115
Yeah.

08:27.150 --> 08:29.551
That means a lot of contracts
to go over,

08:29.587 --> 08:31.319
a lot of meetings...

08:31.355 --> 08:33.121
What, you think that Lizzy
is jealous

08:33.155 --> 08:35.624
that Bubba's spending
too much time with Poppy?

08:35.659 --> 08:37.558
That doesn't sound like
the Bubba I know.

08:37.595 --> 08:39.895
Well, I think wedding stress
is getting to her.

08:39.962 --> 08:41.328
I mean, it is next month.

08:41.365 --> 08:43.432
But if Poppy starts talking
to me tonight...

08:43.467 --> 08:45.667
Oh yeah, you are terrible
at keeping secrets.

08:45.703 --> 08:47.135
Yes. We've established that.

08:47.170 --> 08:47.969
Ok, fine.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.304
I will sit with you.

08:49.339 --> 08:52.741
If you agree to lug that thing
over to Dustin.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.175
Oh. Done.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.778
Oh, ok. See you at the dinner.

08:55.813 --> 08:56.812
Ok.

09:12.262 --> 09:13.128
You're two minutes late.

09:13.163 --> 09:15.397
Yes, I know, but
I brought gifts.

09:15.433 --> 09:16.398
They're due in three weeks.

09:16.434 --> 09:17.433
Oh, Cara, hey.

09:17.468 --> 09:18.534
Hi.

09:18.569 --> 09:19.334
Poppy showed me the video
you guys made.

09:19.369 --> 09:20.302
It looked really good.

09:20.337 --> 09:21.570
Oh yeah, thanks.

09:21.605 --> 09:23.071
We're getting better at it,
I think.

09:23.106 --> 09:24.172
And I just grabbed these books

09:24.207 --> 09:26.842
on how to promote
your brand online.

09:26.877 --> 09:28.343
Who knew this is where
we'd end up

09:28.412 --> 09:31.379
when we were in our dorm room
doing all that crafty stuff?

09:31.415 --> 09:34.416
But Poppy's convinced me we're
gonna take the world by storm.

09:34.452 --> 09:35.884
I'm sure you will.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.920
Thank you. Nice to see you.
Bye.

09:39.089 --> 09:41.790
Oh, those books are
for the donation bin.

09:41.826 --> 09:43.459
Our mystery and
true crime sections

09:43.527 --> 09:46.628
are already over-stuffed
with your cast-offs.

09:46.664 --> 09:50.632
Well, then we can sell them
at the book sale fundraiser.

09:50.701 --> 09:54.803
Has it occurred to you to read
a book about art or philosophy?

09:54.839 --> 09:56.304
Anything more edifying?

09:56.373 --> 09:58.540
A well-written mystery is art.

09:58.576 --> 10:00.676
The twists and turns
of human nature.

10:00.711 --> 10:01.910
And true crime?

10:01.946 --> 10:05.547
It is the very essence
of life and death.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.316
It's all right here
in these books, Lillian.

10:26.804 --> 10:28.637
Oh, Jason Dell.

10:28.672 --> 10:30.305
Hey, long time no see.

10:30.374 --> 10:31.540
How're you doing?

10:31.575 --> 10:33.141
Good. I just got back
into town last month.

10:33.176 --> 10:34.275
Oh, why didn't we see you

10:34.311 --> 10:35.511
at the last Real Murders
Club meeting?

10:35.579 --> 10:38.013
We didn't see Perry
at that meeting, either.

10:38.048 --> 10:39.681
Where is your cousin,
anyway?

10:39.717 --> 10:42.551
He's in Seattle helping his dad
remodel the kitchen.

10:42.586 --> 10:43.485
Oh.

10:43.554 --> 10:44.252
We've been working on this idea.

10:44.287 --> 10:45.988
Here. Check it out.

10:46.023 --> 10:47.455
Dell Investigations.

10:47.491 --> 10:49.625
Yeah. We thought
we'd give it a try.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.894
Oh, I think you guys'll
do great.

10:51.929 --> 10:53.795
And I will keep
this card handy.

10:54.598 --> 10:55.898
See ya.

10:57.768 --> 10:59.668
It's nice to see Jason Dell.

11:01.304 --> 11:02.470
Arthur, wow.

11:02.506 --> 11:03.539
Nice suit.

11:03.574 --> 11:06.008
Oh, thanks. My uh, wife
made me buy it.

11:06.043 --> 11:07.976
<i>Well, these awards honor</i>
<i>our town's finest.</i>

11:08.012 --> 11:09.310
<i>You have to look sharp.</i>

11:09.346 --> 11:11.346
Yes, and you deserve yours,

11:11.381 --> 11:13.649
risking your life like that
to save a little boy.

11:13.684 --> 11:16.384
Oh, I haven't seen Lynn,
is she ok?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.053
She's due any minute, right?

11:18.088 --> 11:20.155
Yes, a couple weeks, but the
doctor has put her on bed rest

11:20.190 --> 11:22.791
and resting doesn't exactly fit
her personality.

11:22.826 --> 11:24.092
I can't find my speech.

11:24.127 --> 11:25.060
I must have left it in the car.

11:25.095 --> 11:26.394
Don't let them start without me.

11:26.463 --> 11:28.296
Don't worry, Madam Mayor,
they wouldn't dare.

11:29.399 --> 11:30.098
Hello.

11:30.133 --> 11:30.432
Hello.

11:30.467 --> 11:31.433
Hi.

11:31.468 --> 11:32.434
Aida, I suppose I have you
to thank

11:32.502 --> 11:33.969
for that lovely gift basket.

11:34.004 --> 11:35.637
Well, me and all
the other realtors.

11:35.673 --> 11:36.605
Hope you enjoy.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.806
I am.

11:37.841 --> 11:38.674
Well, you two look like
you're having fun.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.241
Bubba, where is Lizzy?

11:40.310 --> 11:41.810
Yeah, you know what,
she wasn't feeling so hot

11:41.845 --> 11:43.011
this morning.

11:43.047 --> 11:44.546
I don't think she's gonna
make it, so...

11:44.582 --> 11:45.547
What do you mean?

11:45.583 --> 11:47.515
I'm here.

11:47.551 --> 11:48.684
You knew I was coming.

11:48.752 --> 11:50.586
Yeah, so you are.
It's good to see you.

11:50.621 --> 11:51.720
Lizzy, what did you do?

11:51.755 --> 11:52.821
Drive over here with the car
window open?

11:52.856 --> 11:54.022
No.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.457
No. I have a comb in my purse,
we can fix it.

11:55.492 --> 11:57.125
Will you stop?

11:57.160 --> 11:58.126
Ok.

11:59.096 --> 12:00.161
Let's go find our table.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.162
Ok.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.166
Well, Arthur, shall we?

12:05.202 --> 12:06.635
My pleasure.

12:09.306 --> 12:12.074
She used to let me fix her hair
all the time when we were kids.

12:14.011 --> 12:15.243
Poppy's still not picking up.

12:15.278 --> 12:16.444
I'm getting worried.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.779
Well, you said she was
gonna meet you here.

12:17.848 --> 12:21.116
Yeah, but... I mean,
she's really late.

12:21.151 --> 12:23.752
Dustin, are you sure that Poppy
knows you want her here?

12:23.787 --> 12:25.520
Well yeah, of course she knows.

12:25.555 --> 12:28.023
Why would you say that?

12:28.092 --> 12:29.491
You know what, I should have
picked her up.

12:29.559 --> 12:30.859
I'm just gonna go now-

12:30.894 --> 12:32.995
The mayor is about to start
handing out the awards.

12:34.865 --> 12:36.464
Sally, do me a favor?

12:36.500 --> 12:39.635
Just go check on Poppy,
make sure she's ok?

12:39.670 --> 12:40.969
I- I barely know her.

12:41.005 --> 12:43.404
If it makes him feel better,
would you mind?

12:45.109 --> 12:46.574
I'll go with you.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.576
I've known Poppy
most of her life.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.179
<i>Good evening, everybody.</i>

12:51.214 --> 12:52.681
<i>I am Mayor Terry Sternholz</i>

12:52.716 --> 12:54.683
and I'd like to officially
welcome you to the 12th annual

12:54.718 --> 12:58.219
Lawrenceton Hometown Heroes
Awards Banquet.

12:58.255 --> 13:04.026
[applause]

13:04.061 --> 13:07.462
<i>And we certainly have some real</i>
<i>heroes to celebrate tonight.</i>

13:11.234 --> 13:13.635
Well, Poppy's car is still here.

13:13.671 --> 13:15.503
I wonder if it wouldn't start.

13:24.648 --> 13:25.681
What's that?

13:25.716 --> 13:27.448
Uh, nothing.

13:27.484 --> 13:28.383
Nothing.

13:28.451 --> 13:29.751
Do you wanna knock or should I?

13:29.787 --> 13:30.552
You go ahead.

13:30.587 --> 13:31.386
Ok.

13:31.421 --> 13:33.421
[knocking]

13:34.457 --> 13:35.757
You know, she's
probably sleeping.

13:35.793 --> 13:37.525
The Poppy I know would
never sleep through a party.

13:37.561 --> 13:40.562
Well then maybe she's
in the shower.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.664
What if she fell
in the shower?

13:42.733 --> 13:44.365
[knocking]

13:45.669 --> 13:47.002
I think I still have the key

13:47.037 --> 13:49.304
from when I managed these
properties for my mother.

13:52.209 --> 13:56.144
Poppy? It's Roe and Sally.

13:56.180 --> 13:57.913
Are you here?

13:59.016 --> 14:00.215
I'm gonna check upstairs.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.683
Ok, I'll wait.

14:02.753 --> 14:04.720
Why is it so cold in here?

14:08.291 --> 14:09.290
<i>Poppy?</i>

14:18.301 --> 14:20.235
Roe?!

14:20.303 --> 14:21.770
<i>What?</i>

14:24.241 --> 14:26.674
[gasps]

14:26.710 --> 14:28.710
Oh no!

14:28.779 --> 14:30.078
Poppy!

14:30.114 --> 14:30.946
Oh no!

14:30.981 --> 14:31.947
There's blood.

14:32.015 --> 14:33.681
Oh, why? Why is there blood?

14:33.717 --> 14:35.217
What happened? Is she ok?

14:37.921 --> 14:39.687
No.

14:39.723 --> 14:41.689
She's dead.

14:52.269 --> 14:55.270
[sirens wailing]

15:00.477 --> 15:01.542
We searched the house
and the grounds.

15:01.611 --> 15:02.978
There's no sign of any kind
of knife

15:03.013 --> 15:04.479
or sharp implement outside.

15:04.547 --> 15:06.047
Well, it's possible
we'll find traces of blood

15:06.083 --> 15:07.515
on one of the knives in here.

15:07.550 --> 15:09.251
Can you find out when we'll
get the preliminary report

15:09.286 --> 15:10.385
from the medical examiner?

15:10.420 --> 15:11.686
Yeah.

15:14.191 --> 15:16.925
I used to play dolls with her
when she was eight.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
I'm sorry. Come on, let's get
you in the other room.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.399
So you said that the front door
was locked.

15:24.434 --> 15:25.767
Which one of you opened it?

15:25.836 --> 15:27.635
I did because I still
had the key

15:27.671 --> 15:30.571
from when I managed
my mother's condos.

15:30.607 --> 15:33.175
I thought we'd find her taking
a nap or a shower

15:33.210 --> 15:37.078
or in the middle of
an ice cream binge.

15:37.114 --> 15:39.114
The back door was wide open.

15:39.183 --> 15:40.982
Yeah, the back gate was open
as well.

15:41.018 --> 15:43.618
So whoever it was, well,
they didn't wanna be seen

15:43.653 --> 15:45.620
at the front door.

15:45.689 --> 15:47.155
Or be seen by Poppy at least.

15:47.191 --> 15:49.090
Ok, Roe, I know you're
suggesting premeditation

15:49.126 --> 15:50.992
but I can't be discussing
theories with you.

15:51.061 --> 15:52.694
Or they could have tried
the front door first,

15:52.729 --> 15:55.997
found that it was locked,
went around to the back.

15:56.066 --> 15:59.201
Sally found something
on the front step.

15:59.236 --> 16:01.736
<i>Um, yeah. Yeah, I did.</i>

16:11.281 --> 16:13.014
An empty envelope? That's it?

16:13.050 --> 16:14.349
<i>Mmmhmm.</i>

16:14.384 --> 16:15.984
It's empty?

16:16.053 --> 16:17.919
'Cause I'm sure that you saw
something in it.

16:17.955 --> 16:18.920
<i>Uh-nuh.</i>

16:22.425 --> 16:23.524
Excuse me, detective.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.927
I found this woman approaching
the house.

16:25.963 --> 16:28.930
Poppy asked me to drop off these
supplies for our next project.

16:28.966 --> 16:32.167
I saw all the cop cars.

16:32.202 --> 16:34.169
It can't be true.

16:34.204 --> 16:36.004
I'm so sorry.

16:40.210 --> 16:43.879
I just spoke to her on the phone
a couple of hours ago.

16:43.914 --> 16:45.380
Listen, I'm sorry
but I need to ask,

16:45.415 --> 16:47.548
what time did you speak
with Poppy?

16:47.617 --> 16:51.987
Um... I was getting ready
for work.

16:52.022 --> 16:54.756
The 4:00 to 8:00 shift
at the Yarn Emporium,

16:54.791 --> 17:00.828
so um... at like 3:30?

17:00.864 --> 17:01.930
Well, if you used
your cell phone

17:01.965 --> 17:05.200
it would list the time
of the call.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.467
I'll check.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.803
And who called who?
Did Poppy call you?

17:08.838 --> 17:10.805
Yeah.

17:10.874 --> 17:12.673
At 3:31.

17:14.044 --> 17:16.144
That's the last time I'm ever
gonna talk to her.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.214
What did she wanna talk about?

17:19.249 --> 17:21.582
Ok, Roe, Sally, I've got
everything I need from you two.

17:21.617 --> 17:23.151
Well, she hasn't answered
my question yet.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.618
Roe, you're not wearing a badge.

17:24.686 --> 17:25.987
You can't be interviewing
witnesses at a crime scene,

17:26.022 --> 17:27.388
you know that.

17:27.457 --> 17:28.957
Well, I should probably
tell Dustin what's happened.

17:28.992 --> 17:30.725
No, you shouldn't, Sally,
We'll take care of them.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.028
Poppy's dad will
have to be told, too.

17:33.063 --> 17:35.096
Roe, we got this.
Thank you.

17:36.133 --> 17:38.533
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur,
about Dustin?

17:38.568 --> 17:40.668
It's been a long night.
We'll talk tomorrow.

17:40.703 --> 17:41.702
Tomorrow.

17:46.910 --> 17:49.110
You know, earlier today
Poppy told me that she

17:49.146 --> 17:51.879
and Dustin had an argument
last night.

17:51.915 --> 17:53.048
Oh great.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.117
That means he could be
a suspect now, too.

17:56.153 --> 17:58.119
What do you mean, "too"?

18:00.657 --> 18:01.489
[gasps]

18:01.524 --> 18:02.824
I knew it.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.960
Sally, you found something
in that envelope

18:05.028 --> 18:06.995
that was on the front step,
didn't you?

18:07.030 --> 18:08.496
What was it?

18:08.531 --> 18:12.067
I can't tell you unless you
promise not to tell Arthur.

18:12.102 --> 18:15.570
At least not until I've had a
chance to talk to... the person.

18:15.605 --> 18:18.106
I just need one day. Please?

18:18.175 --> 18:20.775
Ok, yeah, one day, yeah.

18:27.784 --> 18:29.650
Elizabeth Allison Rankart.

18:29.719 --> 18:32.187
It's a wedding dress label.

18:32.222 --> 18:34.389
Poppy embroidered it.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.092
She gave it to Lizzy
at her bridal shower.

18:37.127 --> 18:38.893
Well, why would it be
at the scene of the crime?

18:38.928 --> 18:41.329
Oh, probably some silly reason

18:41.365 --> 18:44.599
like Lizzy didn't wanna be
friends with Poppy anymore.

18:46.803 --> 18:48.669
Sally.

18:48.705 --> 18:51.239
Look, if she killed Poppy do
you really think she'd leave

18:51.274 --> 18:53.708
a calling card right there
on the front step?

18:53.743 --> 18:57.412
Well, she could have dropped it
without knowing it.

18:57.447 --> 18:59.580
There's more, isn't there?

19:05.889 --> 19:07.555
It's Bubba.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.891
With Poppy.

19:09.926 --> 19:11.459
Oh.

19:12.929 --> 19:15.530
Well, it's just a hug.

19:15.598 --> 19:19.867
It's a close one, but...
but it's just a hug.

19:21.538 --> 19:23.505
Oh no, there's more?

19:26.043 --> 19:28.276
"Stay away from
my fiancÃ© or else"

19:28.311 --> 19:31.046
Sally, we have to give this
to Arthur right away.

19:31.081 --> 19:33.381
Lizzy threatened Poppy.

19:33.417 --> 19:35.450
And at least she thought
she had a reason to hurt her.

19:35.485 --> 19:38.686
But we don't know that Poppy
saw any of this.

19:38.721 --> 19:40.988
I mean, it was lying
on the ground, Roe.

19:41.024 --> 19:43.791
Maybe- maybe Lizzy was going
to confront Poppy

19:43.826 --> 19:46.094
and then chickened out and just
left it there for her to find.

19:46.163 --> 19:47.228
I have to at least ask her

19:47.297 --> 19:48.829
before I turn all this
over to Arthur.

19:48.865 --> 19:51.399
She's my family, Roe.

19:51.435 --> 19:53.334
Well, ask her soon.

19:53.370 --> 19:55.836
I mean, hopefully Lizzy's
just bluffing.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.539
And find out who took
the photographs.

19:57.574 --> 19:58.540
I will.

20:01.611 --> 20:03.445
Poor Poppy.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.880
It's awful.

20:05.915 --> 20:10.385
We have to figure out
who could have done this.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.053
Which means we have
to find out

20:12.089 --> 20:15.490
what Poppy and Dustin were
arguing about yesterday.

20:31.015 --> 20:33.214
I'm going to touch base
with Arthur.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.822
I just talked to Poppy's father.

20:40.858 --> 20:43.825
He is just beside himself.

20:43.861 --> 20:46.428
Said he's gonna start
driving down tonight.

20:46.463 --> 20:47.829
I told him why don't you
just take some

20:47.898 --> 20:50.566
time to catch your breath.

20:50.601 --> 20:52.467
Well, maybe Nicole will drive.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.069
Nicole?

20:54.104 --> 20:56.471
Oh. His new wife.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.040
Yeah.

20:58.075 --> 21:02.611
Well, I'm gonna go home and make
sure the guest room is ready.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.816
Bye, darling.

21:13.991 --> 21:16.124
Hey Jason, how would you like
some practice

21:16.193 --> 21:18.694
being a private investigator?

21:18.729 --> 21:20.462
Yeah, you know I'm game.

21:20.497 --> 21:24.032
Good, because somebody needs to
keep an eye on Lizzy Allison.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.770
What? No goodnight kiss
for your fiancÃ©?

22:09.379 --> 22:11.013
I didn't mean for you to do
a full write-up.

22:11.048 --> 22:13.148
You found the body,
you're a witness, so-

22:13.183 --> 22:14.582
Oh good.

22:14.618 --> 22:15.984
I didn't wanna have to do
the reporting on this one.

22:16.053 --> 22:18.820
It is a little close to home.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.355
Why don't you send me
what you wrote

22:20.423 --> 22:21.456
and I'll write the story

22:21.491 --> 22:22.824
and then we'll print it
on my by-line.

22:22.860 --> 22:24.392
Ok.

22:24.427 --> 22:27.462
Maken? You know how the victim's
significant other

22:27.497 --> 22:30.732
is usually first on the list
of suspects?

22:30.768 --> 22:34.036
We don't have to worry
about that with Dustin, right?

22:34.104 --> 22:35.570
I mean, you took him
to that really long lunch

22:35.605 --> 22:36.738
this afternoon.

22:36.774 --> 22:38.339
I did.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.909
He left before the food
even got to the table.

22:55.025 --> 22:58.226
Alright, I put
clean towels in-

22:58.261 --> 23:00.095
mother, are you alright?

23:00.130 --> 23:01.629
Oh, I was just-

23:01.665 --> 23:03.765
I was remembering Poppy running
around here as a little girl.

23:03.801 --> 23:05.567
She was-

23:05.635 --> 23:09.270
she was always so full of life
and always laughing and...

23:12.042 --> 23:12.808
[knocking]

23:12.843 --> 23:14.409
I'll get it.

23:19.717 --> 23:21.783
Hi, come in.

23:21.819 --> 23:22.918
Oh, Marv.

23:22.953 --> 23:25.253
You drove all night, didn't you?

23:27.858 --> 23:29.490
I am sorry.

23:29.559 --> 23:31.860
I am so, so sorry.

23:31.895 --> 23:32.994
You must be Nicole.

23:33.030 --> 23:34.996
Yes, and you're Aurora,
of course.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.865
Though I thought we'd met
at our wedding.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.834
No. Sorry, I wasn't there.

23:38.869 --> 23:42.403
Oh. Well, you missed
quite a party.

23:42.439 --> 23:43.471
My dear girl.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.640
Marv.

23:45.675 --> 23:49.144
Oh, my heart is just broken.

23:49.213 --> 23:52.714
Well, Poppy always looked up
to you like a big sister.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.182
Let me help you get
your bags.

23:54.251 --> 23:57.552
Oh, no. I told Marv
we couldn't possibly impose.

23:57.587 --> 23:58.854
We'll stay at a hotel.

23:58.889 --> 23:59.988
You'll do no such thing.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.489
No, you are going to stay here

24:01.524 --> 24:04.126
so we can make sure you get all
the love and support you need.

24:04.194 --> 24:05.994
<i>I'll get the bags.</i>

24:06.029 --> 24:07.662
Ok.

24:07.697 --> 24:08.630
Oh, Arthur.

24:08.665 --> 24:09.965
Hey Roe.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.833
I was told that Poppy's dad
was on his way here.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.701
Yeah, he's here.

24:13.771 --> 24:15.637
But before you talk to him

24:15.672 --> 24:17.839
you should know that Poppy
and her boyfriend, Dustin,

24:17.875 --> 24:20.142
they had an argument the night
before she was killed.

24:20.177 --> 24:21.609
What?

24:21.645 --> 24:23.711
Why didn't you tell me that
before I interviewed him?

24:23.747 --> 24:25.247
Because you shut the door
in my face.

24:25.315 --> 24:27.548
That's because you were trying
to take over my crime scene.

24:27.584 --> 24:29.918
Now, can I come inside
and do my job, please?

24:29.953 --> 24:31.386
Of course.

24:31.421 --> 24:33.188
Thank you.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.525
Thank you for speaking with me.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.894
I know this is very difficult

24:38.929 --> 24:40.595
and you've got my
deepest sympathy.

24:40.630 --> 24:43.064
We'd be grateful for anything
you can do to help us understand

24:43.100 --> 24:44.332
what happened to our Poppy.

24:44.367 --> 24:45.901
Well, the coroner says
Poppy died sometime

24:45.969 --> 24:48.636
between 3:45 and 4:30 yesterday.

24:48.672 --> 24:50.438
But how?

24:50.473 --> 24:52.473
I can't make my mind believe
it was murder.

24:52.509 --> 24:54.209
We'll know more
after a full autopsy

24:54.278 --> 24:57.279
but the coroner found a stab
wound in Poppy's abdomen

24:57.347 --> 25:00.481
caused by some sort of
serrated blade.

25:00.517 --> 25:03.484
I'm sorry but I'm gonna need
to ask you some hard questions,

25:03.553 --> 25:04.986
like whether you knew of anyone

25:05.022 --> 25:06.154
who might have wished
Poppy harm?

25:06.190 --> 25:07.522
No, no one.

25:07.557 --> 25:08.756
Everyone loved Poppy.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.792
Well, obviously not everyone.

25:12.996 --> 25:14.595
What?

25:14.631 --> 25:16.865
I'm sorry, I don't know
what good it does now

25:16.900 --> 25:19.500
to pretend that Poppy didn't rub
some people the wrong way.

25:19.536 --> 25:22.737
And I don't know what good it
does to be so lacking in tact.

25:25.876 --> 25:31.346
Uh, does anyone need any cream
or sugar for their coffee?

25:31.381 --> 25:34.349
I just assumed that it was
a robbery gone awry.

25:34.384 --> 25:36.284
A stranger broke in and-

25:36.320 --> 25:38.720
and was surprised to find Poppy
at home, perhaps.

25:38.755 --> 25:40.555
Well, that's possible but
from what we can tell

25:40.623 --> 25:42.657
she opened her back door
to her attacker.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.329
That means it was probably
someone she knew.

25:47.364 --> 25:50.966
I'm sorry. Marv knows how much
I adored Poppy

25:51.034 --> 25:53.701
and how upset I am
that she was killed.

25:55.572 --> 25:57.372
But you asked.

25:57.407 --> 25:59.474
And the truth is Poppy
could act like

25:59.509 --> 26:02.744
she was the center
of the universe.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.480
And, if you ask me,

26:05.515 --> 26:08.449
maybe she just pushed
the wrong person too far.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.739
[phone ringing]

26:31.775 --> 26:32.573
<i>Hi Jason.</i>

26:32.642 --> 26:34.309
<i>Hey.</i>

26:34.344 --> 26:36.077
<i>So uh, I've been keeping</i>
<i>an eye on Sally's cousin.</i>

26:36.113 --> 26:37.845
She didn't go anywhere
all night,

26:37.881 --> 26:39.247
and Sally just got here.

26:39.316 --> 26:41.649
Well, keep an eye on the
situation as long as you can.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.084
<i>I have to go to</i>
<i>my mother's today.</i>

26:43.120 --> 26:44.619
People will be coming over
to pay their respects

26:44.687 --> 26:46.521
to Poppy's dad.

26:46.556 --> 26:48.990
It's gonna be such a sad day.

26:49.026 --> 26:51.092
Maybe you can figure out
who's been feeling hostile

26:51.128 --> 26:52.894
towards Poppy lately.

26:52.930 --> 26:54.762
Oh, well I already know
one person

26:54.798 --> 26:56.932
who doesn't seem to have liked
her very much.

26:56.967 --> 26:58.900
Her stepmother.

27:01.972 --> 27:04.872
Lizzy, Poppy gave this to you,
what was it doing on her porch?

27:05.708 --> 27:06.674
Lizzy!

27:06.709 --> 27:07.875
Ok, yes.

27:07.945 --> 27:10.278
I took that to Poppy's
yesterday.

27:10.314 --> 27:12.380
I just wanted her to know
that it's not fair for her

27:12.416 --> 27:13.881
to monopolize my fiancÃ©'s time

27:13.951 --> 27:17.452
while we're trying to plan
our wedding.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.619
Do you know that Bubba
was at her house

27:18.688 --> 27:20.188
until 10: 00 the other night?

27:20.223 --> 27:24.025
Ok, you don't really think that
Poppy was involved with Bubba,

27:24.061 --> 27:25.193
do you?

27:25.228 --> 27:27.562
Well, I didn't wanna think
that, but...

27:27.630 --> 27:30.131
Bubba is just so irresistible.

27:31.268 --> 27:32.567
If you say so.

27:32.602 --> 27:35.103
And Poppy could be so flirty.

27:35.138 --> 27:37.805
Well, you know that jealousy
is considered

27:37.874 --> 27:41.509
a strong motive for murder,
right?

27:41.544 --> 27:44.479
Where did you get
the photos from?

27:44.514 --> 27:46.647
I hired a private investigator.

27:46.683 --> 27:48.984
He took these.

27:49.019 --> 27:51.552
All it shows is Bubba
and Poppy hugging.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.322
Well, pretty intimately
if you ask me.

27:54.358 --> 27:55.190
[sighs]

27:55.258 --> 27:56.924
Are there any more photos?

27:56.960 --> 27:58.226
No.

27:58.261 --> 28:01.329
I stopped working with
the PI after he took these.

28:01.365 --> 28:04.232
Look, Bubba was there
way too often.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.201
He was Poppy's lawyer, Lizzy.

28:06.236 --> 28:07.668
And now you've gone
and placed yourself

28:07.704 --> 28:10.105
at the scene of the crime with
a threatening note, no less.

28:10.140 --> 28:11.473
Well, how was I supposed to know

28:11.508 --> 28:14.175
that it was gonna be
a crime scene?

28:14.211 --> 28:15.410
[sighs]

28:15.445 --> 28:18.079
Ok. Why was the envelope
and all the stuff in it

28:18.115 --> 28:20.482
just lying on the porch, anyway?

28:22.486 --> 28:24.052
Lizzy?

28:26.189 --> 28:28.823
Oh, tell me you didn't get
into a fight with her!

28:28.858 --> 28:31.959
Well, I wouldn't call it
a fight exactly.

28:32.029 --> 28:34.695
[sighs]

28:34.764 --> 28:37.132
I... I went over to Poppy's to
put the envelope in her door.

28:37.167 --> 28:38.566
I didn't know she was home.

28:38.601 --> 28:41.769
She must have seen me coming
because she opened the door.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.905
It surprised me.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.307
I froze.

28:46.343 --> 28:49.477
And then I yelled at her
to stay away from Bubba.

28:49.513 --> 28:51.212
She said she didn't know
what I was talking about

28:51.248 --> 28:53.181
and she slammed the door.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.918
So you didn't give her
the envelope?

28:56.953 --> 29:00.088
No. I was furious.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.989
I threw it and...

29:02.025 --> 29:03.624
it must have landed
on the porch.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.926
But I don't know

29:04.961 --> 29:08.029
because I was already
on my way back to my car.

29:08.065 --> 29:09.164
And that's it.

29:09.199 --> 29:10.631
I swear.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.034
I saw her for five seconds.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.207
You believe me, don't you?

29:20.043 --> 29:22.810
Lizzy, of course I do.

29:22.845 --> 29:25.780
But you do know that I have
to give all this to the police

29:25.848 --> 29:27.682
and tell them where I found it.

29:30.087 --> 29:31.852
Go ahead.

29:31.888 --> 29:34.855
I know that I didn't do
anything wrong.

29:43.184 --> 29:46.704
I- I think your mother's a
little put out with my wife.

29:47.358 --> 29:50.626
Oh, that's just because
she doesn't know her well.

29:50.662 --> 29:53.797
None of us do.

29:53.832 --> 29:56.032
So what brought
you two together?

29:56.068 --> 29:58.068
A lot of things, actually.

29:58.103 --> 29:59.936
But one of the things I really
like about Nicole

29:59.971 --> 30:03.707
is that she tends to speak
her mind.

30:03.775 --> 30:07.343
That I've seen.

30:07.378 --> 30:09.478
Did she and Poppy
get along well?

30:09.514 --> 30:10.947
Ah, they butted heads a bit.

30:10.982 --> 30:13.349
I mean, Poppy also tended
to speak her mind,

30:13.384 --> 30:16.986
just a little louder.

30:17.022 --> 30:18.955
So they clashed.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.091
Sometimes.

30:21.159 --> 30:23.126
We uh, we had planned
a visit for next month.

30:23.161 --> 30:24.627
We were gonna stay with Poppy.

30:24.662 --> 30:27.263
I thought it would be a good
chance for Poppy and Nicole

30:27.298 --> 30:31.434
to maybe um, find some
common ground.

30:33.471 --> 30:35.839
That chance is gone.

30:38.844 --> 30:41.177
You spent a lot of time
with Poppy lately.

30:41.213 --> 30:43.546
Would you say she was happy?

30:43.615 --> 30:45.915
Yeah, I would.

30:45.951 --> 30:49.318
She was very excited about her
new book coming out and...

30:49.354 --> 30:52.421
and her YouTube channel growing.

30:52.457 --> 30:55.225
Yeah, and I think she was having
a lot of fun with Dustin.

30:55.260 --> 30:56.559
Who's Dustin?

30:56.628 --> 30:58.327
Her boyfriend.

30:58.396 --> 31:00.196
Of the last three months?

31:00.232 --> 31:01.664
She didn't tell you?

31:01.699 --> 31:03.499
Not a word.

31:10.142 --> 31:11.174
Jason?

31:11.243 --> 31:12.909
What're you doing here?

31:12.944 --> 31:14.577
Uh, how'd you spot me?

31:14.612 --> 31:16.212
Thought I was being covert.

31:16.281 --> 31:17.914
I know your car.

31:17.949 --> 31:19.282
What're you doing here?

31:19.317 --> 31:21.584
Roe asked me to keep an eye
on your cousin.

31:21.653 --> 31:23.153
She thinks she might be
a suspect

31:23.188 --> 31:24.687
in the Poppy Wilson murder.

31:24.756 --> 31:27.556
Ugh. I suppose she will be.

31:27.592 --> 31:29.292
Which is why I'm heading over
to Bubba's office

31:29.327 --> 31:31.527
to ask him directly if he had
any interest

31:31.562 --> 31:33.462
in Poppy outside of being
a client,

31:33.531 --> 31:35.665
then I have to go see Arthur.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.500
You shouldn't have
to do that alone.

31:37.535 --> 31:38.968
I'll follow you.

31:40.939 --> 31:42.405
[knocking]

31:45.610 --> 31:47.010
Dustin, hi. Come in.

31:47.045 --> 31:48.411
Thanks.

31:51.749 --> 31:53.683
This is so surreal.

31:53.718 --> 31:56.052
I still can't believe
that she's gone.

31:56.121 --> 31:58.154
I'm so sorry for your loss.

32:00.091 --> 32:02.458
You two had grown pretty close,
huh?

32:02.493 --> 32:03.659
Yeah.

32:03.695 --> 32:05.128
I mean, we hadn't been dating
that long

32:05.163 --> 32:08.431
but it was just one of those
instant connections, you know?

32:08.499 --> 32:10.200
Yeah.

32:10.235 --> 32:12.302
Hey, is that- is that
her dad there?

32:12.337 --> 32:13.036
Mmmhmm.

32:13.071 --> 32:14.503
Can you introduce me?

32:14.539 --> 32:15.839
Sure.

32:17.675 --> 32:19.876
Um, but can I ask you
a question first?

32:19.911 --> 32:23.546
Um, Poppy told me that the two
of you had an argument

32:23.614 --> 32:27.050
the night before she was killed.

32:27.085 --> 32:29.085
An argument?

32:29.154 --> 32:30.686
That's what she called it?

32:30.722 --> 32:34.090
I'm sure that Detective Smith
will ask you what it was about.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.859
I already talked to Detective
Smith last night,

32:35.894 --> 32:36.860
he didn't say anything-

32:36.895 --> 32:39.062
I told him this morning.
He was here.

32:41.499 --> 32:43.766
Well, I don't know why
she would say that.

32:43.801 --> 32:45.068
We didn't argue.

32:45.103 --> 32:48.171
We never argued,
that's the thing.

32:48.206 --> 32:50.673
Well, all couples fight
once in a while.

32:50.708 --> 32:51.908
No.

32:51.943 --> 32:54.277
Not when the guy is so in love
with the girl

32:54.346 --> 32:57.446
that he always gives her exactly
what she wants.

33:04.155 --> 33:04.988
Mr. Wilson?

33:05.023 --> 33:05.621
Yes?

33:05.656 --> 33:07.423
Hi, I'm Dustin.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.058
<i>This is Nicole.</i>

33:14.099 --> 33:14.998
Arthur.

33:15.033 --> 33:16.299
I didn't expect to see you here.

33:16.334 --> 33:18.801
And yet I am not at all
surprised to see you here.

33:18.836 --> 33:20.603
But we're uh, pretty much done.

33:20.638 --> 33:21.938
What- uh, why?

33:22.007 --> 33:24.007
Well, the good detective here
beat a path to my door

33:24.042 --> 33:25.641
when his associates
found my fingerprints

33:25.676 --> 33:27.576
all over Poppy's kitchen.

33:27.612 --> 33:29.212
I was there earlier in the week
to go over some details

33:29.247 --> 33:30.546
of their book contract.

33:30.615 --> 33:31.847
I'm sure Cara will confirm it.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.149
Well, it doesn't mean

33:33.218 --> 33:34.517
you weren't there
yesterday afternoon.

33:34.552 --> 33:35.751
Well, young man,
you have a point.

33:35.820 --> 33:38.321
But as I also told Arthur I was
in court all day

33:38.356 --> 33:40.556
working through a probate case
with Judge Henderson.

33:40.591 --> 33:41.857
That sounds like a solid alibi.

33:41.893 --> 33:43.059
Yes it does.

33:43.128 --> 33:44.294
Now, if it's alright with you,

33:44.329 --> 33:45.761
I'd like to pay my respects
to Marv Wilson.

33:48.766 --> 33:49.698
Ok, look.

33:49.734 --> 33:51.000
I know what you guys are doing.

33:51.036 --> 33:52.635
I know as Real Murders Club
members you and Roe

33:52.670 --> 33:55.204
are gonna do everything you can
to try and solve Poppy's murder.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.206
Hey, you're Real Murders, too.

33:57.275 --> 33:58.574
No I'm not, not right now.

33:58.609 --> 34:00.410
With Lynn on maternity leave
I'm the acting chief

34:00.445 --> 34:02.245
and I promised her that I would
do things her way

34:02.314 --> 34:04.814
so please, guys, give us
some distance, ok?

34:04.849 --> 34:07.150
Let us get the job done.

34:07.218 --> 34:09.885
Oh, and if you do come across
any information

34:09.955 --> 34:11.920
I want your word that
you will share it with me.

34:11.956 --> 34:13.688
I have no problem with that.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.992
You?

34:18.129 --> 34:19.628
Sally?

34:20.864 --> 34:22.431
Ok.

34:22.500 --> 34:26.469
The envelope I found on
Poppy's porch last night...

34:26.504 --> 34:28.571
It wasn't empty.

34:28.606 --> 34:30.706
Um...

34:30.775 --> 34:32.308
Poppy made the label
for my cousin Lizzy

34:32.344 --> 34:33.708
for her wedding dress.

34:33.744 --> 34:37.612
The photos were taken by
a private eye and the note,

34:37.648 --> 34:41.717
well, Lizzy just told me that
she confronted Poppy yesterday

34:41.752 --> 34:45.121
because she thought Poppy was
having an affair with Bubba.

34:45.156 --> 34:47.790
Hang on, you- you held back
evidence in a murder?

34:47.859 --> 34:48.824
I know it was wrong.

34:48.860 --> 34:49.859
I'm sorry, Arthur.

34:49.893 --> 34:52.094
It's just that she's family.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.496
I had to talk to her first.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.831
Wow. I mean- I- I could arrest
you for obstruction.

34:55.867 --> 34:57.666
I should arrest you
for obstruction

34:57.702 --> 34:58.968
but I'll have to deal
with that later.

34:59.004 --> 35:00.936
Right now I need to go talk
to Lizzy.

35:00.972 --> 35:03.873
And I'll have to talk
to Bubba again.

35:05.276 --> 35:07.776
I hate it when Arthur
is mad at me.

35:11.016 --> 35:15.584
I threw the envelope toward the
porch and went back to my car.

35:15.653 --> 35:20.123
Look, it was just a silly act of
jealousy, that's all.

35:20.158 --> 35:21.891
And what time was this?

35:21.926 --> 35:27.630
Um, I got off work a little bit
late so quarter to 4:00?

35:27.698 --> 35:31.000
And you just... turned
and got in your car?

35:31.036 --> 35:33.069
Your note threatened her.

35:33.104 --> 35:34.603
Are you sure you didn't
go around the back

35:34.639 --> 35:37.440
and try to talk to her again?

35:37.475 --> 35:38.841
No.

35:38.910 --> 35:41.677
I got in my car
and I drove away.

35:41.712 --> 35:44.147
Poppy was very much alive
when I left,

35:44.182 --> 35:47.316
I promise you.

35:47.385 --> 35:48.918
You know, I should really be
at Aida's

35:48.986 --> 35:51.387
paying respect to the Wilsons.

35:51.456 --> 35:53.989
Why were you late
for the awards dinner?

35:56.528 --> 35:57.993
Uh... oh.

35:58.029 --> 36:01.197
Oh, I spilled tea on my dress
as I was getting ready to leave

36:01.232 --> 36:05.468
the house for the dinner
so I had to go get changed.

36:05.503 --> 36:06.669
Right.

36:06.737 --> 36:10.139
And no one else was here
with you at the time?

36:10.175 --> 36:12.007
No, but-

36:12.043 --> 36:14.843
Do you own a set
of steak knives, Lizzy?

36:14.879 --> 36:17.447
Well, yes, I keep them
on my count-er...

36:23.088 --> 36:29.925
Um... why do you ask?

36:29.994 --> 36:31.860
The coroner says the wound
that killed Poppy

36:31.929 --> 36:35.198
was caused by a serrated blade
four inches long.

36:35.233 --> 36:38.434
Exactly the length of a serrated
steak knife.

36:41.573 --> 36:45.674
Well, um...

36:45.743 --> 36:48.111
I don't know where my set is.

36:48.179 --> 36:49.178
[sighs]

36:49.214 --> 36:50.580
You need to call your lawyer,
Lizzy,

36:50.648 --> 36:54.584
'cause I'm taking you in
for formal questioning.

36:54.619 --> 36:56.885
It just seems,
as Poppy's lawyer,

36:56.921 --> 36:58.421
I'd know if someone
had issue with her.

36:58.456 --> 36:59.888
We're all searching our minds

36:59.924 --> 37:01.624
for some clue as to
who would do such a thing.

37:01.692 --> 37:03.259
Yeah.

37:05.029 --> 37:07.863
Wow. You have a lot of nerve
coming here.

37:07.898 --> 37:09.332
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:09.367 --> 37:10.399
Really?

37:10.468 --> 37:11.601
Please.

37:11.636 --> 37:12.768
Poppy was my best friend,

37:12.803 --> 37:15.404
you don't think she told
me everything?

37:15.440 --> 37:18.174
And if you're hoping Poppy
forgave you before she died,

37:18.209 --> 37:21.277
you can stop,
because she didn't.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.811
Cara are you okay?

37:32.923 --> 37:35.591
Yeah.

37:35.660 --> 37:38.294
I'm just upset.

37:38.329 --> 37:42.398
I mean, I not only lost Poppy
but I lost everything

37:42.467 --> 37:45.501
we worked so hard for together.

37:45.570 --> 37:48.371
I just don't understand
why this is happening.

37:48.406 --> 37:50.640
Well, I wanna understand, too.

37:50.675 --> 37:51.840
[glass shatters]

37:51.909 --> 37:52.808
I'm so sorry.

37:52.877 --> 37:55.077
No, no, no, no worries,
that's ok.

37:55.112 --> 37:56.479
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

37:56.514 --> 37:57.380
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:57.448 --> 37:58.847
<i>Be careful, be careful.</i>

38:05.290 --> 38:07.356
Cara. I'm- I'm sorry,

38:07.392 --> 38:11.427
but I overheard you say that
Poppy hadn't forgiven Nicole.

38:11.462 --> 38:15.230
May I ask what that was about?

38:15.266 --> 38:21.270
Um... well, Poppy told me that
Nicole asked Marv

38:21.339 --> 38:25.641
to change his will to make
Nicole the sole beneficiary

38:25.677 --> 38:26.942
and of course Marv said no

38:26.977 --> 38:32.348
but now that Poppy's gone...

38:32.417 --> 38:34.183
I- I shouldn't have said
anything to Nicole.

38:34.218 --> 38:36.952
I'm sure she's just as upset
as I am that Poppy's gone.

38:36.987 --> 38:40.690
We'll all miss Poppy so much.

38:40.725 --> 38:43.459
Cara, did Poppy say anything
to you about her and Dustin

38:43.494 --> 38:47.996
having a fight the night before
she died?

38:48.032 --> 38:53.902
Oh, um... no, but it's like
I told that detective.

38:53.938 --> 38:57.473
When I talked to Poppy yesterday
she was trying to figure out

38:57.508 --> 39:00.909
how to get out of going
to the awards dinner.

39:00.945 --> 39:03.178
Did she say why?

39:03.214 --> 39:07.383
Um, I'm sorry,
I have to go.

39:11.222 --> 39:11.920
Oh, sorry.

39:11.956 --> 39:12.955
Sorry.

39:13.791 --> 39:15.891
Hi Dustin.

39:15.926 --> 39:16.859
Hey.

39:16.894 --> 39:18.427
Oh, there you are.

39:18.463 --> 39:21.864
Uh, I would like an explanation,
please.

39:21.899 --> 39:22.998
What're you talking about?

39:23.033 --> 39:25.968
You sent Jason to keep an eye
on Lizzy.

39:26.003 --> 39:27.737
Why would you do that
without telling me?

39:27.772 --> 39:30.305
Because I was worried about
the contents of the envelope.

39:30.341 --> 39:32.808
You have to admit, it makes
Lizzy look suspicious.

39:32.844 --> 39:35.878
Lizzy would never have anything
to do with a murder.

39:35.913 --> 39:37.813
I gave the envelope and
everything in it to Arthur

39:37.849 --> 39:39.749
so I'm sure he's figured
that out by now.

39:39.784 --> 39:41.250
Sally, good. You're here.

39:41.285 --> 39:43.151
I need you to come down to
the police station with me.

39:43.187 --> 39:44.186
Oh, why?

39:44.221 --> 39:46.389
Arthur hauled Lizzy in
for questioning.

39:46.424 --> 39:48.824
He's calling her a person
of interest.

39:52.397 --> 39:54.029
I'm going with you.

40:00.371 --> 40:01.937
Lizzy loses track of her
knife set

40:02.006 --> 40:03.873
and now she's sitting in
an interrogation room

40:03.908 --> 40:05.040
scared out of her wits?

40:05.109 --> 40:06.642
Ok, first she was at the scene
of the crime

40:06.711 --> 40:08.210
in the time window
of the murder.

40:08.245 --> 40:10.446
No, she was outside the scene.

40:10.481 --> 40:12.314
Yes, having angry words
with the victim

40:12.349 --> 40:13.982
and as for the missing
knife set,

40:14.051 --> 40:15.918
like I told Lizzy,
the coroner says

40:15.986 --> 40:17.520
that the stab would
that killed Poppy

40:17.555 --> 40:21.891
was caused by a serrated blade
four-inches long.

40:21.926 --> 40:23.392
But you don't actually
have a knife

40:23.461 --> 40:25.294
and no physical evidence.

40:25.329 --> 40:26.929
Do you Arthur?

40:26.964 --> 40:29.598
Lizzy's prints or anything that
places her inside Poppy's condo?

40:29.634 --> 40:31.099
We'll know soon enough.

40:31.135 --> 40:33.436
Well I'm representing her
and I wanna see her right now.

40:33.471 --> 40:34.837
Be my guest.

40:36.340 --> 40:39.007
Do you really think that Lizzy
could do this to Poppy, Arthur?

40:39.076 --> 40:40.075
Ok, you know what?

40:40.110 --> 40:41.243
I'm- I'm not gonna answer that.

40:41.278 --> 40:42.845
What about Dustin,
her boyfriend?

40:42.880 --> 40:44.379
Yes, I'm pretty sure
he was out of the office

40:44.449 --> 40:46.315
the entire afternoon
that Poppy was killed.

40:46.350 --> 40:47.616
Yes, I know that.

40:47.652 --> 40:49.217
We're looking at all the
possibilities right now,

40:49.253 --> 40:50.285
following every lead.

40:50.321 --> 40:51.554
That's what police
detectives do,

40:51.589 --> 40:52.822
which neither of you are,

40:52.857 --> 40:55.591
so guys, please, just let me
get back to work.

41:00.230 --> 41:03.298
I know in my heart Lizzy
couldn't have done this, Roe.

41:03.334 --> 41:05.100
Well, we may not be detectives,

41:05.135 --> 41:07.470
but it doesn't mean we can't
solve this crime.

41:10.808 --> 41:12.274
Marv, you're exhausted.

41:12.309 --> 41:15.043
Let's get you upstairs
so you can get some sleep.

41:15.079 --> 41:16.211
Marv, it's been such a long day.

41:16.246 --> 41:18.280
You need your rest.

41:18.315 --> 41:21.951
Not that closing my eyes
will make it all go away, but...

41:22.019 --> 41:23.318
I'll come up.

41:23.354 --> 41:24.487
Good night.

41:24.522 --> 41:25.988
Good night.

41:26.023 --> 41:28.357
And uh, thank you for everything
you've done, both of you.

41:28.392 --> 41:30.192
I wish it were more.

41:30.695 --> 41:31.159
Good night.

41:31.195 --> 41:32.127
Good night.

41:32.162 --> 41:34.062
Oh, Nicole, you dropped
something.

41:34.098 --> 41:35.865
Oh?

41:35.900 --> 41:37.065
It looks like a gas receipt.

41:37.134 --> 41:38.467
No, it's not mine.

41:38.503 --> 41:39.969
Oh, ok. Good night.

41:40.004 --> 41:41.637
Good night.

42:04.328 --> 42:05.293
What?

42:07.632 --> 42:09.031
<i>Aurora!</i>

42:09.066 --> 42:10.365
What?! What?!

42:13.938 --> 42:15.070
What?

42:16.674 --> 42:18.607
Somebody broke into the house.

42:35.993 --> 42:38.794
Well, nothing's been taken
as far as I can tell.

42:38.829 --> 42:40.295
I don't know why someone
would break in

42:40.330 --> 42:42.397
just to knock over a trash can.

42:42.433 --> 42:44.833
Well, something woke me
a little after midnight.

42:44.869 --> 42:47.069
I- I thought I heard
footsteps upstairs.

42:47.104 --> 42:49.104
Yeah, but honey, I don't think
that's what you heard

42:49.173 --> 42:51.373
because I got up and looked,
remember?

42:51.442 --> 42:53.776
Were either of you two up
walking around after midnight?

42:53.811 --> 42:57.212
No, but the idea that someone
was walking around my house

42:57.247 --> 42:59.448
in the middle of the night
after-

42:59.483 --> 43:01.283
after what happened to Poppy?

43:01.318 --> 43:05.754
Oh, I can't imagine one has
anything to do with the other.

43:05.790 --> 43:09.191
I can't imagine that
they're not connected.

43:09.226 --> 43:11.627
Ok, well, we'll see if we
come up with some prints

43:11.662 --> 43:13.996
and I'll get back to you, ok?

43:14.065 --> 43:15.831
Yeah.

43:21.072 --> 43:22.071
Hey, Arthur.

43:22.106 --> 43:23.639
Arthur, wait.

43:23.674 --> 43:27.810
I don't know if Cara told you
but Nicole tried to get Marv

43:27.878 --> 43:31.013
to change his will so she would
become the sole beneficiary.

43:31.048 --> 43:33.181
Yeah, she did mention something
to that effect.

43:33.250 --> 43:34.950
So is Nicole on your
suspect list?

43:35.019 --> 43:37.019
Roe, I am not discussing
my suspect list.

43:37.054 --> 43:39.287
Besides, she lives hours away.

43:39.323 --> 43:41.323
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that
she couldn't have hired someone

43:41.358 --> 43:44.292
to get rid of Poppy
and come after Marv.

43:44.328 --> 43:46.762
I mean, maybe that's why someone
broke in here last night.

43:46.797 --> 43:50.966
Except Marv thwarted the plan
by waking up.

43:51.002 --> 43:52.835
You think that she hired someone
to kill her husband

43:52.870 --> 43:56.005
while she was lying
right next to him?

43:56.040 --> 43:58.173
Look, Marv Wilson
is a very wealthy man.

43:58.208 --> 44:00.442
And with Poppy gone
Nicole stands to inherit

44:00.477 --> 44:02.878
a very large fortune
once Marv dies.

44:02.913 --> 44:05.648
Ok, it's official.
You read too many mysteries.

44:05.683 --> 44:08.350
No, actually I study
a lot of true crime.

44:08.385 --> 44:11.520
Do you remember the first year
at Real Murders?

44:11.555 --> 44:13.922
We covered the Jacobson case.

44:13.958 --> 44:16.659
A man made a jailhouse
confession 20 years

44:16.694 --> 44:19.862
after Ted Jacobson hired him
to kill his wife

44:19.930 --> 44:23.398
while he ate a turkey
sandwich downstairs.

44:23.433 --> 44:25.134
That's right, Jacobson didn't
do a day of time for that,

44:25.169 --> 44:26.769
did he?

44:26.804 --> 44:28.403
So is Nicole on your list?

44:28.438 --> 44:30.739
Uh... you don't give up, do you?

44:30.808 --> 44:32.207
Well, she's definitely on mine.

44:32.276 --> 44:33.642
Mmmhmm.

44:38.803 --> 44:40.110
I know our next
Real Murders meeting

44:40.160 --> 44:41.472
isn't for another
couple of weeks

44:41.508 --> 44:44.008
so I appreciate you all
coming down here.

44:44.043 --> 44:46.210
I can't think of a better way
to use our common interest

44:46.246 --> 44:48.146
than to try to solve
the murder of someone

44:48.181 --> 44:50.848
who meant so much to us.

44:50.883 --> 44:51.915
We all want to help.

44:51.984 --> 44:53.451
It's the right thing to do.

44:53.486 --> 44:54.318
Thank you, Larry.

44:54.354 --> 44:56.320
And yes, it is.

44:56.389 --> 44:59.457
Ok, so I emailed all of you a
summary of what we know so far

44:59.492 --> 45:00.924
before the meeting.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.826
Let's talk about suspects.

45:05.198 --> 45:07.865
Number one, Nicole Wilson.

45:10.069 --> 45:11.769
Nicole didn't get along
with Poppy

45:11.837 --> 45:12.970
and according to Cara,

45:13.005 --> 45:14.672
tried to cut Poppy
out of Marv's will,

45:14.740 --> 45:16.474
so she has a motive.

45:16.543 --> 45:19.043
How much money does
old Marv have, anyway?

45:19.078 --> 45:19.977
A lot.

45:20.012 --> 45:22.079
Like at least eight figures.

45:22.114 --> 45:24.282
But there's no real evidence
that points to her.

45:24.350 --> 45:25.583
No, not yet.

45:25.652 --> 45:29.453
All of the evidence so far
points to number two,

45:29.489 --> 45:31.389
Lizzy Allison.

45:33.693 --> 45:35.259
Now, Lizzy admits to being
jealous of Poppy.

45:35.295 --> 45:36.527
Said she confronted her,

45:36.563 --> 45:38.062
and she was at the scene
of the crime

45:38.097 --> 45:40.531
during the window of time
the murder occurred.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.667
Uh, she was outside the scene.

45:42.735 --> 45:44.702
Well, there's also
the missing knife set.

45:44.737 --> 45:46.970
Which Lizzy swore was in
her kitchen the day before.

45:47.006 --> 45:49.106
She has no idea where it went.

45:49.141 --> 45:51.075
Who does she think made it
go away?

45:51.110 --> 45:53.077
Who has access
to Lizzy's kitchen?

45:53.145 --> 45:57.915
Well, that would be her fiancÃ©,
number three, Bubba Rankart.

45:57.950 --> 46:00.218
Bubba's fingerprints are
all over Poppy's house.

46:00.286 --> 46:01.619
He explained that.

46:01.654 --> 46:03.221
But why would he want
to kill her?

46:03.256 --> 46:04.855
Yeah, I mean, what's his motive?

46:04.890 --> 46:06.390
Why would he want to kill
his own client?

46:06.459 --> 46:08.826
Well, if Lizzy was worried he
was seeing Poppy on the sly...

46:08.894 --> 46:09.727
Yeah, but he wasn't.

46:09.762 --> 46:11.929
Suppose he was?

46:11.997 --> 46:14.798
And suppose Poppy threatened
to tell Lizzy about it

46:14.834 --> 46:16.066
a month before the wedding?

46:16.102 --> 46:17.568
There's your motive.

46:17.604 --> 46:20.471
But he was in Judge Henderson's
court room all afternoon.

46:20.506 --> 46:21.772
I know the judge.

46:21.807 --> 46:23.741
I'll find out if that alibi
really is air tight.

46:23.776 --> 46:24.942
Good.

46:25.010 --> 46:28.979
That brings us to number four,
Dustin Sykes.

46:31.183 --> 46:34.619
Poppy said she and Dustin had
a fight but Dustin denied it,

46:34.654 --> 46:37.355
and Cara said that she didn't
wanna go to the awards dinner.

46:37.390 --> 46:39.890
Yet Dustin said that
she'd agreed to meet him there.

46:39.959 --> 46:43.160
Wait, you said he didn't
go back into work that day.

46:43.229 --> 46:44.595
So if he wasn't at work...

46:44.631 --> 46:46.364
Then he could have gone
to pick up Poppy

46:46.399 --> 46:48.198
for dinner after all,

46:48.268 --> 46:50.735
and she could have told him
she didn't want to go.

46:50.770 --> 46:52.169
He could have gotten angry.

46:52.204 --> 46:53.738
They could have fought again...

46:53.773 --> 46:55.506
Ugh, this is horrible.

46:55.575 --> 46:58.342
Well, see if you can rule
Dustin out.

46:58.378 --> 46:59.744
Find out what he was doing
that afternoon.

46:59.812 --> 47:02.313
Maybe he has another alibi
besides work.

47:02.348 --> 47:04.749
And Jason, you come with me
and we'll talk to Cara.

47:04.784 --> 47:06.584
See if Poppy told her anything
else about Dustin

47:06.619 --> 47:08.986
or Bubba or Nicole.

47:09.021 --> 47:10.755
My money's on the stepmother.

47:10.790 --> 47:13.691
Well, if it is her that would
explain the break-in

47:13.726 --> 47:14.858
at my mother's last night.

47:14.927 --> 47:16.093
I know the Jacobson case.

47:16.128 --> 47:18.061
But why would Nicole
want to have Marv killed

47:18.097 --> 47:20.130
so soon after Poppy died?

47:20.166 --> 47:23.768
Yeah, doesn't that just make her
look more suspicious?

47:23.803 --> 47:26.870
Well, not if she were clever
enough to cover her tracks.

47:27.973 --> 47:29.674
Ah, the gas receipt.

47:29.742 --> 47:32.009
I forgot to tell you
about the receipt I found.

47:34.614 --> 47:37.548
So I found this on the living
room floor of my mother's house.

47:37.583 --> 47:39.983
It's a receipt to a gas station
right around the corner

47:40.019 --> 47:41.485
from Poppy's condo,

47:41.521 --> 47:43.921
date and time stamped
within the time frame

47:43.956 --> 47:46.557
that Poppy was killed, 3:53.

47:46.626 --> 47:47.858
So you think Nicole dropped it?

47:47.927 --> 47:50.227
Well, she could have,
but she denied it.

47:50.262 --> 47:52.730
Or Dustin Sykes
or Bubba Rankart.

47:52.765 --> 47:55.265
They were all at the reception
yesterday.

47:55.301 --> 47:56.400
Jason, you go talk to Cara.

47:56.436 --> 47:57.534
I'm gonna go to this gas station

47:57.569 --> 47:59.670
and find out who bought
this gas.

47:59.706 --> 48:01.372
And if anyone else
has any other insights

48:01.441 --> 48:03.273
please call me right away.

48:03.309 --> 48:04.942
Ok, thank you all for coming.

48:08.280 --> 48:09.246
See this right here?

48:09.281 --> 48:10.781
It means it was paid
at the pump.

48:10.817 --> 48:11.749
We don't pay attention
to people who do that.

48:11.784 --> 48:13.484
Not unless they ask for help.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.952
Ok.

48:22.995 --> 48:25.062
Hey, do these security
cameras work?

48:25.097 --> 48:27.665
I mean, if the police came
and asked for the footage

48:27.700 --> 48:29.433
would they be able to get it?

48:29.469 --> 48:30.601
Oh sure.

48:30.636 --> 48:32.236
Yeah, we had a couple robberies
this last year

48:32.271 --> 48:34.672
so the owner makes sure
they're working.

48:34.707 --> 48:36.073
Thanks.

48:36.108 --> 48:37.140
[phone rings]

48:37.209 --> 48:38.008
Hello, mother.

48:38.043 --> 48:39.510
<i>Hi honey.</i>

48:39.545 --> 48:40.878
<i>Marv got a call telling him</i>
<i>that he's allowed</i>

48:40.946 --> 48:42.747
<i>to go into Poppy's condo now.</i>

48:42.782 --> 48:45.916
He needs to get some of her
clothes to take to the mortuary.

48:45.985 --> 48:47.651
<i>The idea of going there</i>
<i>is just too much for him</i>

48:47.687 --> 48:49.720
so I told him that I'd see
if you could go

48:49.756 --> 48:51.722
and pick out an outfit for her.

48:51.758 --> 48:53.357
<i>Oh, sure yeah, I can do that.</i>

48:53.393 --> 48:56.894
I just have to stop at
the police station first.

48:56.929 --> 48:58.061
I have to give Arthur something.

48:58.097 --> 48:59.697
Ok. Thank you.

49:07.707 --> 49:10.408
Maisey, do you know
where Dustin is?

49:10.443 --> 49:12.175
No.

49:12.211 --> 49:14.812
Why is he always gone lately?

49:14.847 --> 49:17.882
Well, if you ask me he
should take some time off.

49:17.917 --> 49:20.250
That poor man is heartbroken
over Poppy.

49:20.319 --> 49:21.151
Is he?

49:21.186 --> 49:22.620
<i>Sally.</i>

49:22.655 --> 49:24.555
I just got a tip from my contact
at the coroner's office.

49:24.590 --> 49:26.356
They're saying that due
to the angle of the wounds

49:26.392 --> 49:29.092
that Poppy Wilson's killer
is probably left-handed.

49:30.930 --> 49:34.765
Lizzy's definitely not a leftie.

49:34.801 --> 49:37.301
Oh, but I've bumped elbows with
Dustin at the conference table

49:37.369 --> 49:39.703
enough times to know
that he's a leftie.

49:52.718 --> 49:54.452
Wild.

49:54.487 --> 49:55.285
Hi.

49:55.321 --> 49:56.654
Can I help you with something?

49:56.722 --> 49:57.688
Yeah.

49:57.723 --> 49:59.222
I've got a ton of questions.

50:01.527 --> 50:03.561
About yarn?

50:03.596 --> 50:05.295
Not exactly.

50:25.351 --> 50:26.717
<i>[door closes]</i>

50:37.964 --> 50:39.396
Somebody here?

50:39.431 --> 50:41.632
[door creaks]

50:43.836 --> 50:45.369
[gasps]

51:10.630 --> 51:12.997
Two break-ins
in two days, Arthur?

51:13.032 --> 51:14.732
First at my mother's
and now one here.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.767
Well I can't see any signs
this person broke in.

51:16.802 --> 51:18.201
Are you sure the front door
was locked?

51:18.237 --> 51:19.670
Yeah, positive.

51:19.705 --> 51:21.972
Which means whoever it was
probably had a key.

51:22.008 --> 51:24.474
Well, who would have had
a key to Poppy's place?

51:24.544 --> 51:25.709
Her lawyer maybe?

51:25.745 --> 51:27.344
No, no, Bubba was definitely
not just here.

51:27.379 --> 51:30.014
I've already got a tail on him
and Lizzy.

51:30.082 --> 51:32.182
What about Dustin Sykes?

51:32.217 --> 51:34.952
I mean, they were dating,
maybe Poppy gave him a key.

51:34.987 --> 51:36.987
I can call Sally and see
if he's still at work.

51:38.290 --> 51:40.891
I wish you would have got
a better look at him.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.026
Well, the last thing
I was expecting

51:42.094 --> 51:44.695
was for someone to jump
out of the closet.

51:44.730 --> 51:46.730
Do you think it was the killer?

51:46.766 --> 51:48.298
Or do you think
someone killed Poppy

51:48.333 --> 51:50.133
because she had something
hidden here?

51:50.169 --> 51:50.968
I don't...

51:51.037 --> 51:51.869
[ringing]

51:51.904 --> 51:52.770
<i>This is Sally.</i>

51:52.838 --> 51:54.004
Hey, it's me.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.338
I need to know if Dustin
is at work right now.

51:55.374 --> 51:56.774
No, he's been
out all afternoon

51:56.809 --> 51:58.876
<i>and he didn't tell anyone</i>
<i>he was leaving.</i>

51:58.911 --> 52:00.210
Why do you ask?

52:00.245 --> 52:02.345
I just caught someone
searching Poppy's bedroom.

52:02.381 --> 52:05.549
I mean, I didn't see who it
was but I just saw him running.

52:05.585 --> 52:07.851
Uh, Sally said that Dustin
is not at work.

52:07.887 --> 52:09.587
<i>Oh, are you with Arthur?</i>

52:09.622 --> 52:11.388
<i>Ok, we got a tip</i>
<i>the coroner thinks</i>

52:11.423 --> 52:12.623
<i>the killer is left-handed.</i>

52:12.692 --> 52:15.926
Tell Arthur that Dustin
is left-handed.

52:24.301 --> 52:25.101
Hey.

52:25.136 --> 52:26.468
You wanted to see me?

52:26.537 --> 52:27.870
Yeah.

52:27.905 --> 52:31.107
Uh, Cara has something to tell
you about Dustin Sykes.

52:31.142 --> 52:32.942
Right this way.

52:35.012 --> 52:36.145
I should have said something
that first night,

52:36.180 --> 52:39.615
I just- I didn't...

52:39.650 --> 52:43.886
I believed that Dustin was truly
in love with Poppy.

52:43.955 --> 52:47.356
I mean, it just never occurred
to me that he could hurt her.

52:47.391 --> 52:49.091
But it's occurred to you now.

52:49.160 --> 52:51.093
No.

52:51.129 --> 52:53.195
I don't know.

52:53.231 --> 52:55.664
All I know is that I was
in her kitchen

52:55.699 --> 52:58.267
when he came over the night
before she died.

52:58.302 --> 53:00.836
I mean, he didn't know
I was there.

53:00.872 --> 53:05.674
He- he rushed in all excited
and then all of a sudden

53:05.743 --> 53:09.211
he was down on one knee
asking her to marry him.

53:09.247 --> 53:12.381
He had this big,
fat ring and...

53:12.416 --> 53:14.383
And?

53:14.418 --> 53:16.485
She turned him down.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.155
I mean, they'd only been dating
for three months.

53:19.223 --> 53:21.991
But she said she was sorry,
she wasn't ready,

53:22.026 --> 53:25.727
and then she said
she wasn't sure

53:25.763 --> 53:28.764
she was even in love
with him at all.

53:28.833 --> 53:31.033
Well, why do you think
she wasn't sure?

53:31.102 --> 53:32.168
I don't know.

53:32.236 --> 53:35.437
I mean, she said he was
too needy.

53:35.472 --> 53:37.306
And how did he react
to all this?

53:37.341 --> 53:39.441
Well, he didn't say much but...

53:39.476 --> 53:42.477
I mean, I got the impression
he was humiliated.

53:42.513 --> 53:45.480
And then he left in a hurry.

53:45.516 --> 53:47.850
You know, when I asked him how
serious the relationship was

53:47.885 --> 53:50.853
he said not very.

53:50.888 --> 53:53.155
Sounds like he was lying.

53:53.224 --> 53:55.590
Do you know if he left the ring
there at Poppy's

53:55.659 --> 53:56.959
or if he took it with him?

53:56.994 --> 53:59.328
Um... no, I don't- I don't know.

53:59.396 --> 54:00.863
I didn't ask.

54:00.898 --> 54:03.165
I mean, I was just
so embarrassed for him.

54:03.201 --> 54:04.834
Maybe that's what he was
looking for today, the ring.

54:04.869 --> 54:07.136
I- I need to get an APB
out on him.

54:11.209 --> 54:13.475
Wait, will they arrest him
because of what I just said?

54:13.544 --> 54:16.778
Well, if they do arrest him it
won't be just because of that.

54:16.814 --> 54:19.248
I really don't think
that he could hurt her.

54:19.283 --> 54:20.950
He loved her.

54:21.018 --> 54:23.552
Hey, do you wanna get
some coffee or something?

54:25.289 --> 54:27.189
I'd like that.

54:50.014 --> 54:50.679
What're you doing?

54:50.714 --> 54:51.513
[yelps]
Ohhh!

54:51.582 --> 54:53.115
Dustin, there you are.

54:53.150 --> 54:54.283
You're searching my desk?

54:54.352 --> 54:55.851
I didn't feel good about it.

54:55.887 --> 55:00.222
I was just trying to figure out
where you went.

55:00.258 --> 55:01.790
Maken was asking for you.

55:04.428 --> 55:05.627
Where have you been?

55:05.662 --> 55:09.899
I've been sitting in my car.

55:09.967 --> 55:12.167
The woman I love just died

55:12.236 --> 55:18.807
so I sit in my car
and I think about her.

55:18.842 --> 55:21.277
What about her condo?

55:21.345 --> 55:24.046
Do you ever go there
and think about her?

55:24.115 --> 55:27.383
Like maybe this afternoon?

55:27.418 --> 55:29.651
Why would you say that, Sally?

55:29.686 --> 55:30.953
Um...

55:30.988 --> 55:34.957
Mr. Sykes, I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

55:36.894 --> 55:38.660
<i>[door closes]</i>

55:43.134 --> 55:44.833
I really appreciate your picking
up some things

55:44.868 --> 55:46.402
from Poppy's closet.

55:46.437 --> 55:48.537
Oh, I'm happy to help.

55:48.572 --> 55:50.872
Well, I guess we should
get going to the mortuary.

55:50.942 --> 55:52.141
Yeah.

55:52.176 --> 55:54.243
Oh, let me uh, give you the key
to Poppy's condo

55:54.278 --> 55:55.610
in case you need anything else.

55:55.679 --> 55:57.679
That's ok. I've got the key
that Poppy gave me.

56:00.551 --> 56:02.251
At least I did.

56:04.521 --> 56:05.487
Thanks.

56:08.692 --> 56:10.059
Uh, Nicole?

56:10.127 --> 56:11.860
Can I uh, talk to you
for a second?

56:11.929 --> 56:12.928
I'll just get the car.

56:12.964 --> 56:13.929
Ok.

56:16.267 --> 56:17.466
<i>[door closes]</i>

56:18.702 --> 56:21.570
You have mud on your shoes
like I did earlier.

56:21.605 --> 56:23.839
And I bet if I opened up
your purse

56:23.874 --> 56:26.175
you would have that key.

56:26.243 --> 56:30.645
You were the one I chased
out of Poppy's condo today.

56:30.681 --> 56:33.282
So that was you?

56:33.317 --> 56:34.549
I thought the murderer
was returning

56:34.585 --> 56:36.918
to the scene of the crime.

56:36.954 --> 56:38.920
You were looking
for something.

56:38.956 --> 56:40.722
Yes, photos of Poppy.

56:40.757 --> 56:43.692
I'm making Marv a collage,
but shh, don't tell him.

56:43.727 --> 56:45.760
I want it to be a surprise.

56:45.796 --> 56:46.795
Bye.

56:54.638 --> 56:56.238
It was Nicole.

56:56.273 --> 56:58.507
She was the one searching
Poppy's bedroom today.

56:58.542 --> 56:59.941
You're kidding.

56:59.977 --> 57:01.943
I was sure it was Dustin.

57:02.013 --> 57:03.545
I mean, I'm glad it's not him,
but...

57:03.580 --> 57:04.713
Are you sure about that?

57:04.781 --> 57:06.115
Yes, Roe.

57:06.150 --> 57:07.883
I'm sure I don't wanna
be working ten yards away

57:07.918 --> 57:10.386
from a potential killer.

57:10.454 --> 57:12.354
Did Nicole tell you why?

57:12.423 --> 57:15.424
She gave me some excuse
that I don't buy for a second.

57:15.459 --> 57:19.728
No, there was something she
wanted in that condo very badly.

57:19.763 --> 57:22.398
Oh, please don't say what
I think you're gonna say.

57:22.433 --> 57:23.865
Oh yeah.

57:23.901 --> 57:26.601
First thing tomorrow we're
going over there to find it.

57:36.013 --> 57:37.246
Sykes's attorney is here.

57:37.314 --> 57:38.747
Yeah.

57:40.751 --> 57:42.884
Gentlemen. I hope you haven't
said anything.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.453
No, no, no.

57:44.488 --> 57:46.422
Your client has been doing his
best quiet as a mouse impression

57:46.457 --> 57:47.889
but I have a lot of questions.

57:47.925 --> 57:49.991
Which he is not going
to answer.

57:50.027 --> 57:51.326
Dustin, are you ready
to go?

57:51.362 --> 57:52.694
Why wouldn't he want
to cooperate?

57:52.763 --> 57:54.696
I assume you want your
girlfriend's killer found.

57:54.731 --> 57:57.366
I assume you would just love
to cast him in that role.

57:57.401 --> 57:59.435
Now why should he help you
build a case against him?

57:59.470 --> 58:02.504
Well, if he's innocent then
he's got nothing to worry about.

58:02.540 --> 58:05.140
Well, unless you've got a good
reason to keep my client here

58:05.176 --> 58:07.209
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to let him go.

58:07.244 --> 58:09.545
<i>Did you ask Poppy to marry you?</i>

58:11.549 --> 58:12.281
They don't have a thing.

58:12.316 --> 58:13.382
Let's go.

58:13.417 --> 58:14.216
Yeah, well, the judge might
not agree

58:14.251 --> 58:15.217
when I ask for that warrant.

58:15.252 --> 58:16.651
His prints were
all over the condo.

58:16.687 --> 58:18.387
Yeah, where he
visited frequently.

58:18.456 --> 58:20.289
And the alibi he gave
for the time of the murder?

58:20.324 --> 58:22.691
It doesn't hold up, so he should
definitely be talking to me.

58:22.726 --> 58:23.658
We'll give that some thought.

58:23.694 --> 58:25.327
Have a nice day.

58:29.200 --> 58:30.199
There is some pie
in the fridge

58:30.234 --> 58:31.467
if either of you
would like some.

58:31.502 --> 58:32.468
No, thanks.

58:32.503 --> 58:34.436
[banging outside]

58:41.245 --> 58:44.713
It's just a neighbor
closing a gate.

58:44.781 --> 58:46.415
We're all a little jumpy,

58:46.450 --> 58:48.717
wondering if the- the person
who showed up last night

58:48.752 --> 58:50.352
is coming back.

58:50.387 --> 58:52.988
Well, Arthur said he's sending a
patrol car by every hour or two

58:53.023 --> 58:54.223
for the next few days.

58:54.258 --> 58:55.524
<i>Well, that's a relief.</i>

58:55.559 --> 58:57.626
Yes, it is.

58:57.661 --> 58:59.328
Oh, Marv.

58:59.363 --> 59:00.662
Let's turn in for the night.

59:00.731 --> 59:02.297
It's been a rough day.

59:03.967 --> 59:04.866
Good night, you two.

59:04.901 --> 59:05.767
Oh, good night.

59:05.802 --> 59:06.668
Thank you for dinner.

59:06.737 --> 59:08.303
Good night.

59:15.078 --> 59:16.811
You're doing it again.

59:16.847 --> 59:18.847
Giving Nicole
the suspicious eye.

59:18.882 --> 59:21.617
Oh mother, I know that you're
willing to buy Nicole's excuse

59:21.685 --> 59:23.485
about being at Poppy's
condo today-

59:23.521 --> 59:25.854
Oh, I am not Nicole's
biggest fan,

59:25.922 --> 59:28.423
but I see no reason not to give
her the benefit of the doubt.

59:28.459 --> 59:31.926
Didn't you notice that she was
the only one not jumpy tonight?

59:31.962 --> 59:35.264
Not worried or afraid
of another intruder,

59:35.299 --> 59:37.633
probably because she planned
the first one.

59:37.668 --> 59:39.801
Aurora you know I don't approve
of your getting involved

59:39.836 --> 59:41.370
with solving these crimes.

59:41.405 --> 59:45.006
Mother, the victim was someone
we knew very well.

59:45.042 --> 59:46.608
I realize that.

59:46.644 --> 59:48.544
But how many other
undeserving people

59:48.579 --> 59:51.547
got tangled in your
net of suspicion?

59:51.615 --> 59:53.114
That's how it works.

59:53.150 --> 59:54.449
Every case that I've studied

59:54.485 --> 59:56.918
the investigator finds the truth
through skepticism.

59:56.987 --> 59:59.087
Through resisting the urge
to give people

59:59.122 --> 01:00:00.822
the benefit of the doubt.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:02.624
You're not an investigator.

01:00:02.693 --> 01:00:04.793
You're a librarian.

01:00:04.828 --> 01:00:07.563
And what is all this skepticism
doing to you?

01:00:07.598 --> 01:00:09.264
To your relationships
with other people?

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:12.467
With the world?

01:00:12.503 --> 01:00:15.937
Oh, mother, I know that
you're worried about me.

01:00:16.006 --> 01:00:18.240
But what we should be worried
about right now is that we may

01:00:18.275 --> 01:00:20.775
be harboring the very person
that killed Poppy.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.115
Just promise me that you will
lock your bedroom door tonight.

01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:34.919
So basically my mother had said
I'm too suspicious.

01:00:35.272 --> 01:00:38.173
That I don't have a healthy
relationship with the world.

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:40.775
I think I have a very healthy
relationship with the world.

01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:42.644
If you say so.

01:00:42.679 --> 01:00:45.013
Skepticism isn't unhealthy,
it's-

01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:47.115
skepticism keeps you safe.

01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:50.685
Oh wow.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.121
Poppy made some pretty hefty
deposits into her bank account

01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:54.423
in the past few months.

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:56.791
Her business must have been
taking off big time.

01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:58.693
Really?

01:00:58.728 --> 01:01:00.728
Who do you think inherits
that money?

01:01:00.764 --> 01:01:02.197
Must be her dad, right?

01:01:02.232 --> 01:01:03.698
I think so?

01:01:03.733 --> 01:01:05.167
Well, we have to find out.

01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:06.768
'Cause if Poppy's money
goes to Marv

01:01:06.803 --> 01:01:08.937
and Marv's money
goes to Nicole...

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:13.641
You know, we have opened
up every drawer in this room.

01:01:13.677 --> 01:01:14.776
There are no false bottoms,

01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:16.678
there's nothing
taped underneath.

01:01:16.713 --> 01:01:18.380
I don't think we're gonna find
whatever it is

01:01:18.415 --> 01:01:19.948
Nicole was looking for.

01:01:19.984 --> 01:01:22.050
[crinkling]

01:01:22.086 --> 01:01:23.885
This cushion crinkled.

01:01:25.722 --> 01:01:27.522
There's something
in the cushion.

01:01:39.436 --> 01:01:42.704
Oh, it's a letter
from Nicole to Poppy.

01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:44.539
Not a very nice letter.

01:01:44.574 --> 01:01:46.475
This one's almost threatening.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:48.643
Why would she hide these?

01:01:48.712 --> 01:01:50.812
For safe keeping?

01:01:50.847 --> 01:01:53.015
Marv told me that he and Nicole
were going to be staying

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.583
with Poppy for a visit
next month.

01:01:55.619 --> 01:01:57.819
Maybe she was gonna use these
to blackmail Nicole,

01:01:57.854 --> 01:01:59.821
show her father eventually.

01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:01.156
Oh, I don't know.

01:02:01.225 --> 01:02:03.358
But I do think you should
probably call Arthur.

01:02:03.394 --> 01:02:05.027
I will.

01:02:05.062 --> 01:02:06.428
But now I'm even more worried

01:02:06.463 --> 01:02:10.399
that Nicole could have hired
someone to take out Poppy.

01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:14.002
Except she opened the door
to whoever killed her.

01:02:14.071 --> 01:02:16.038
What I do know is Nicole
didn't like Poppy

01:02:16.073 --> 01:02:18.173
and had a reason
to get rid of her.

01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:19.441
Marv could be next.

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:20.675
Marv?

01:02:20.744 --> 01:02:22.544
Who's staying with you
and Aida?

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:25.813
Roe, do you know
what that means?

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:27.815
Yeah.

01:02:27.851 --> 01:02:30.085
My mother and I could be
in danger, too.

01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:36.591
"You grew up spoiled and have
only spoiled further

01:02:36.626 --> 01:02:37.992
"as far as I can tell

01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:39.528
"and if you continue to
undermine me with your father

01:02:39.563 --> 01:02:43.565
"then you leave me no choice
but to fight fire with fire."

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.135
Ok, I can see why you two found
these letters so concerning.

01:02:47.171 --> 01:02:49.571
Why would Nicole
secretly search for them

01:02:49.606 --> 01:02:51.739
if they don't implicate her
in Poppy's death?

01:02:51.808 --> 01:02:54.008
Uh, maybe she just wanted to
find them before her husband did

01:02:54.078 --> 01:02:55.243
so he wouldn't be upset with her

01:02:55.279 --> 01:02:58.012
for the problems she was having
with Poppy.

01:02:58.048 --> 01:02:59.614
Good point.

01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:01.616
Still, I'm not ready to give
her the benefit of the doubt.

01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:04.052
Especially if she's the one that
dropped that receipt you found.

01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:05.353
Exactly.

01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:06.854
Arthur, did you get a hold
of that security footage

01:03:06.923 --> 01:03:08.490
from the gas station
for that day?

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:09.757
Oh, yeah.

01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:10.692
Officer Heard's going
over the tapes right now

01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:11.526
so that he could-

01:03:11.562 --> 01:03:13.195
ok, wait, uh-uh.

01:03:13.263 --> 01:03:15.097
You two are doing it again.

01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:16.398
[together] Doing what?

01:03:16.433 --> 01:03:17.365
That thing you do where you try
and get me to talk

01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:18.567
about the case.

01:03:18.635 --> 01:03:19.701
No, no.

01:03:19.769 --> 01:03:21.570
We brought you new evidence
in the case.

01:03:21.605 --> 01:03:23.305
We are being good citizens,
Arthur.

01:03:23.373 --> 01:03:24.372
And whoever bought that gas,

01:03:24.408 --> 01:03:26.007
they were very near
Poppy's place

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.442
right around the time
of the murder.

01:03:27.478 --> 01:03:28.577
Yeah.

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:30.445
What she said.

01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:32.481
No. I'm not giving you anything.

01:03:42.126 --> 01:03:43.258
Oh, Dustin.

01:03:43.293 --> 01:03:44.759
You scared me.

01:03:47.097 --> 01:03:51.433
If I ask you something
will you tell me the truth?

01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:57.472
Does everybody here think
that I had something to do

01:03:57.508 --> 01:04:00.775
with Poppy's murder?

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:06.314
Well, I think it's obvious the
police consider you a suspect.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:10.252
If I ask you a question
will you tell the truth?

01:04:13.757 --> 01:04:17.091
Where were you the afternoon
Poppy was killed?

01:04:17.161 --> 01:04:19.294
Because no one here knows.

01:04:19.329 --> 01:04:23.031
I was at the jeweler.

01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:26.834
I was trying to get
my money back for a ring

01:04:26.903 --> 01:04:29.504
that I tried to give Poppy.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.976
I asked her to marry me,

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:41.049
like some overanxious puppy
and she shot me down.

01:04:41.084 --> 01:04:43.318
So now you know.

01:04:45.922 --> 01:04:47.722
Now take the yarn
in your right hand,

01:04:47.757 --> 01:04:50.692
wrap it around the needle
and pull it tight,

01:04:50.727 --> 01:04:53.127
keeping tension on the yarn.

01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:54.729
Let's see.

01:04:54.764 --> 01:04:55.564
[laughs]

01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.232
Getting there.

01:04:57.267 --> 01:04:59.133
Jason?

01:05:01.305 --> 01:05:02.504
Beautiful.

01:05:02.539 --> 01:05:04.239
Good work.

01:05:04.308 --> 01:05:06.140
Into the first stitch.

01:05:06.176 --> 01:05:08.243
So this is what you've been
doing lately?

01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:09.611
Learning to knit?

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.646
Only to find out more
about Poppy

01:05:11.682 --> 01:05:13.815
and what she was going through.

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.252
And... you know.

01:05:17.321 --> 01:05:18.953
Beautiful choice,
I love this one.

01:05:20.324 --> 01:05:21.889
You like Cara.

01:05:21.925 --> 01:05:24.459
She's pretty awesome.

01:05:24.494 --> 01:05:26.428
Sorry to keep you waiting, Roe.

01:05:26.463 --> 01:05:28.863
There's always a ton of
questions after a lesson.

01:05:28.898 --> 01:05:30.398
Not a problem.

01:05:30.434 --> 01:05:33.968
Um, so you wanted to talk to me
about my business with Poppy?

01:05:34.003 --> 01:05:36.238
I wanna know what happens to
the money from the business.

01:05:36.273 --> 01:05:37.505
Does it go to you?

01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:38.473
Does it go to-

01:05:38.508 --> 01:05:39.507
Oh, no.

01:05:39.543 --> 01:05:42.143
Um, 'cause I'm not her...

01:05:42.212 --> 01:05:43.077
Beneficiary.

01:05:43.113 --> 01:05:44.346
Right. Beneficiary.

01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:46.147
Yes, right. That's her dad.

01:05:46.182 --> 01:05:47.782
At least I think.

01:05:47.817 --> 01:05:49.584
You'd have to ask Bubba Rankart.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.553
He set up our corporation
for us.

01:05:51.622 --> 01:05:55.290
Wrote up the contracts for who
got which share of the profits.

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:57.058
Was Marv a partner?

01:05:57.093 --> 01:05:58.727
He gave us the start-up money

01:05:58.795 --> 01:06:01.696
so he has a big stake
in the company.

01:06:01.732 --> 01:06:04.966
I only got 20 percent but still,

01:06:05.001 --> 01:06:07.902
we were starting to do
really well and...

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.437
I had to tell our editor
this morning

01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:10.872
that there wasn't gonna be
a book.

01:06:10.907 --> 01:06:13.275
Or any more videos.

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:15.577
Well, why not keep it going?

01:06:15.612 --> 01:06:17.545
You know, do the book yourself?

01:06:17.581 --> 01:06:18.647
Be in the videos?

01:06:18.682 --> 01:06:20.148
Me?

01:06:20.183 --> 01:06:23.718
No. Poppy was the one
that was good at that stuff.

01:06:23.754 --> 01:06:25.287
You could try.

01:06:25.322 --> 01:06:27.355
Maybe I could help you.

01:06:28.325 --> 01:06:29.357
[bell rings]

01:06:29.393 --> 01:06:31.058
Oh, excuse me.

01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:34.228
Hi, can I help you?

01:06:38.635 --> 01:06:39.367
Hey.

01:06:39.436 --> 01:06:40.602
Romeo.

01:06:40.637 --> 01:06:42.069
I'm gonna go to Bubba's office,

01:06:42.105 --> 01:06:43.772
see if I can find out more about
what happens to

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.873
Poppy's share of the profits
in the company.

01:06:45.942 --> 01:06:47.309
But if it all goes
to Marv then-

01:06:47.344 --> 01:06:49.844
Yeah, that could be another
strike against Nicole.

01:06:53.317 --> 01:06:54.816
Well, there's still a lot
to pin down

01:06:54.884 --> 01:06:58.320
but my money is on Dustin Sykes.

01:06:58.355 --> 01:06:59.521
Oh, Lynn, the mayor
just walked in.

01:06:59.556 --> 01:07:01.055
Can I call you back?

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:02.724
Yeah- I- I'll call you back.

01:07:02.759 --> 01:07:04.225
How can I help?

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.993
I just got this transcript
from Judge Henderson's office

01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:07.329
for the day of Poppy
Wilson's murder.

01:07:07.364 --> 01:07:08.896
Oh, if you're talking
about Bubba's alibi

01:07:08.932 --> 01:07:11.065
I already confirmed court
was in session all afternoon.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.302
Well, according to this it
wasn't the entire afternoon.

01:07:14.338 --> 01:07:15.770
Look.

01:07:17.173 --> 01:07:18.906
Here, at 3:25.

01:07:18.942 --> 01:07:20.408
Judge calls a recess
so he can dial into

01:07:20.444 --> 01:07:22.210
his son's parent-teacher
conference.

01:07:22.245 --> 01:07:25.480
Court doesn't resume until 4:07.

01:07:25.515 --> 01:07:27.248
That's a 42-minute recess.

01:07:27.283 --> 01:07:28.450
And Poppy lives, what,

01:07:28.485 --> 01:07:30.385
maybe 15 minutes
from the courthouse?

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.053
Enough time to get there
and back.

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:34.889
Hey boss.

01:07:34.924 --> 01:07:36.090
I think I found what
you're looking for

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:37.692
on those security tapes
from the gas station.

01:07:44.568 --> 01:07:47.235
Ok, here it is.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:50.505
3:44pm.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.275
Here's the car and
there's the driver.

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:55.977
It's Bubba Rankart.

01:07:56.045 --> 01:07:57.879
That gas station is nowhere
near the courthouse, is it?

01:07:57.914 --> 01:07:59.213
No, it's not.

01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:01.383
But it's right around the corner
from Poppy's place.

01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:03.585
And it's right at the time
of the murder.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.031
Arthur, were you here
to see Bubba?

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:26.299
Yes, and his receptionist said
he bolted out the back

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.234
when he saw us pull up.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.401
What?

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:29.737
Why would Bubba be running away
from you?

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.872
You mean away from me
and my search warrant?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.741
What are you searching for
in Bubba's office?

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.643
Uh-nuh, you know I am not
gonna tell you that.

01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:37.544
Any sign of Bubba yet?

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.812
No, but we found something.

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.115
Aurora, you need to go. Please.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:42.549
Get those to forensics.

01:08:42.584 --> 01:08:44.451
That was Lizzy's knife set,
wasn't it?

01:08:44.486 --> 01:08:46.319
There was a knife missing.

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:47.154
Ok, no.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:48.555
Again, I cannot tell you that.

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.057
Bubba Rankart is not a killer.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.259
Yeah, well there's a warrant
out for his arrest.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:54.795
Oh no.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:56.662
It was Bubba
who bought the gas

01:08:56.698 --> 01:08:57.798
near Poppy's that day,
wasn't it?

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:58.598
Ok, no.

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.000
Mmm-mmm.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:11.478
Poppy's lawyer?

01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:12.979
That's who the police think
killed her?

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:17.216
Aurora said that there's a
warrant out for his arrest.

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:19.519
Bubba's my lawyer, too,
and a very good friend.

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:22.022
I- I just hope this is all
some terrible mistake.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.555
I'd like to go down
to the police station,

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:26.426
find out for myself
what they know.

01:09:26.461 --> 01:09:28.962
I'll get my purse.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:33.133
Look, I'm sorry if it turns out
to be your friend,

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.035
but I want justice
for my daughter.

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:36.703
Oh Marv, of course.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:38.638
Only the truth matters.

01:09:49.584 --> 01:09:51.984
Shocking, that a person
I thought I knew

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.922
could be essentially dark
at his core.

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.657
Of course you're probably not
the least surprised by this.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.659
The way you immerse yourself
in every tale of murder

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:00.794
you can find.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:04.298
For once I am surprised.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.399
But I can't shake the feeling
that the wrong person

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:09.903
has somehow been cast
in the role of the killer.

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:12.739
I suppose you think you know
the right person?

01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:14.041
I wish I did.

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.909
It's all pointing to Bubba
right now.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:16.543
Mother.

01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:17.410
Hi.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:18.511
Um, hi Lillian.

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.679
Can I talk to you a minute?

01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:22.049
Yeah. Is everything ok?

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:24.184
So I've been thinking about
Bubba and I remembered

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.387
that a few years ago he asked me
to find a garage for him to rent

01:10:27.422 --> 01:10:29.589
so that he could store
his boat, which I did,

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.592
and then he sold the boat.

01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:34.494
But it was a four-year lease.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:37.164
He must still have the keys
to that garage.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.266
Do you think he could
be there now?

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:42.736
I was gonna go check on him
myself but I lost my nerve.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.571
Maybe if you could come
with me?

01:10:44.639 --> 01:10:46.907
Wow, mother, I think you'd want
Arthur to go?

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:49.276
I know, but Bubba is a good
and loyal friend.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:52.179
Please, I- I just wanna talk
to him first.

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:55.615
Wow, first Sally and now you.

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.885
Ok, let me tell Lillian
I'm leaving early.

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:58.952
Ok.

01:11:02.724 --> 01:11:05.025
Here let me-
let me knock.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.093
Ok, bossy.

01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:09.229
[knocking]

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.797
Bubba?

01:11:10.832 --> 01:11:12.665
It's Aida.

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.534
Are you in there?

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:19.006
Maybe he's not
in there after all.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.875
I don't hear anything.

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.377
Do you wanna wait?

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:26.679
I don't know if I'm disappointed
or relieved.

01:11:26.748 --> 01:11:29.983
No, let's just go.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:32.986
[door opens]

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:48.302
Bubba, why in the world
are you holed up

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.003
in a place like this?

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.940
You mean besides watching
my life go down in flames?

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:56.043
I just- I've been going through
my old correspondence with Poppy

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:58.845
and any one of my dealings with
her just looking for red flags.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.480
You know the police
are looking for you.

01:12:00.515 --> 01:12:03.850
I know, but I just needed some
time to go through this stuff.

01:12:03.885 --> 01:12:07.654
And... well, I've been wrestling
with my guilt.

01:12:07.722 --> 01:12:09.990
So it's true. You-
you killed Poppy?

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:12.225
What? No, of course
I didn't kill Poppy.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.360
For crying out loud, Aida,

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.196
that's not what I feel
guilty about.

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.864
Why don't you have a seat
and I'll tell you everything?

01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:20.834
No- no, I think I'd rather hear
this standing up.

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.772
Look, Lizzy wasn't shy about
being jealous of Poppy

01:12:25.807 --> 01:12:27.774
so I told her to go ahead
and talk to her, you know?

01:12:27.809 --> 01:12:30.277
Find out there's nothing funny
going on between us.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.845
Well, that morning Lizzy told
me that she planned

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.547
to go by Poppy's house after she
got off work to talk to her,

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:37.384
and I was fine with that,
but as the day wore on

01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:39.819
I just- I started to worry.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.154
So when Judge Henderson
called a recess,

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:45.192
well, I drove to Poppy's house.

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:46.960
I got there right in time to see
Lizzy leaving so I thought,

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.561
you know, great, they must
have talked it out.

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.030
So I went back
to the courthouse.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:53.600
And stopped to get gas
on the way.

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:56.769
It wasn't until I heard that
Poppy had been killed

01:12:56.838 --> 01:13:01.308
and I saw that Lizzy's steak
knife set had a knife missing.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:05.945
But I thought
what if it was Lizzy?

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.981
Well, did you ask her
if she did it?

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.616
Well, it's not all that simple
when you're a month away

01:13:09.684 --> 01:13:11.051
from getting married.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.652
I mean, I knew most likely
it wasn't her

01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:14.321
but can you imagine
if she thought

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.755
I had even suspected her?

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.857
Yeah, she could get offended
and call the wedding off.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.226
Then you see the problem.

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.327
Look, I just wanted some time

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:21.761
to go through all this stuff
on my own.

01:13:21.796 --> 01:13:23.830
So I took the knife set

01:13:23.865 --> 01:13:26.799
so the police wouldn't jump
to any hasty conclusions

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:29.236
until I could prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:32.805
that Lizzy had nothing to do
with Poppy's murder.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.308
And then I realized how guilty
that can make me look

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.077
and I thought of other things
that can make me look guilty

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.345
like the gas receipt
that placed me

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.947
right near the scene
of the crime,

01:13:40.982 --> 01:13:42.416
which I knew was
in my pocket

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.684
before I went to your house
to pay my respects to Marv.

01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:46.520
So you broke into my house?

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.754
I'm so sorry, Aida.

01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:49.289
I'll pay for any damage
I caused.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.191
I was in a state of panic
and I wasn't thinking clearly.

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:52.526
I hope you can forgive me.

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.161
No, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.562
No, no harm done.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:58.465
Clearly you were under distress.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.333
Thank you.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:01.301
Well, that's why I'm here.

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.070
I'm just trying to get clear,

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.504
see if I can come up
with any leads

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.074
on who really did kill Poppy.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.843
But I swear to you,
it wasn't me.

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:14.081
And I really believe
it wasn't Lizzy, either.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.049
So do I.

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:18.185
But you have to turn
yourself in

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.654
and trust that Arthur is gonna
figure out what really happened.

01:14:26.928 --> 01:14:28.328
So Arthur showed up,
read him his rights

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.330
and they took him off
to the station.

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.631
Wow.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:33.100
I hope Bubba's telling the truth
and it's not him.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.301
Well, I don't know.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.236
You don't run if you're
not guilty.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.905
Unless he spent all night
in that garage

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.340
trying to figure out if
he should take the fall

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.608
for his girlfriend or not?

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.875
It's not Lizzy.

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.044
She's not left-handed,
but Jason has a point.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.646
If it wasn't Bubba then
we still don't know who-

01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:49.849
Excuse me. I need to get
to the copy machine.

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:51.585
Thank you.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.186
[clears throat]

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.157
So is anyone still up
for coming over

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:58.291
and going through
that list again,

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.859
see if we missed anything?

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:03.396
No can do, I told Cara I'd help
her with a video this afternoon.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.764
Awe, that's sweet.

01:15:04.799 --> 01:15:06.199
Well, I'm up for it.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.135
Just give me a call
when you're ready.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.242
I'd still keep an eye on your
cousin Lizzy if I were you.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.812
Excuse me.

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.819
He's the one I'm gonna be
keeping my eye on.

01:15:34.886 --> 01:15:36.219
Ok.

01:15:38.223 --> 01:15:38.822
Hey.

01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:39.956
Hi.

01:15:40.025 --> 01:15:41.224
Uh, mother, I'll be back
in an hour or so.

01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:44.194
Oh, no, no, no. Stay and watch
Cara's video.

01:15:44.262 --> 01:15:46.595
Oh.

01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:49.398
So this is what you've been
working on with Cara?

01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:51.267
It's a tribute to Poppy.

01:15:51.303 --> 01:15:52.802
For their YouTube channel.

01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:55.171
I really couldn't have done it
without him.

01:15:58.276 --> 01:15:59.876
Alright. Ok.

01:16:03.781 --> 01:16:04.580
Oh...

01:16:08.987 --> 01:16:16.659
<i>â™ª I can't help but traveling</i>
<i>down memory lane, â™ª</i>

01:16:16.694 --> 01:16:18.995
<i>â™ª The taste of life... â™ª</i>

01:16:19.064 --> 01:16:22.531
Like so many who
have messaged me,

01:16:22.567 --> 01:16:25.335
Poppy's death
makes me feel robbed

01:16:25.403 --> 01:16:28.671
of a beautiful light in my life,

01:16:28.706 --> 01:16:30.473
but it also makes me feel lucky

01:16:30.508 --> 01:16:34.210
to have known such
a creative talent.

01:16:34.246 --> 01:16:37.480
<i>I have a new friend</i>
<i>who convinced me today</i>

01:16:37.515 --> 01:16:39.916
<i>that Poppy wouldn't want</i>
<i>her dream to end</i>

01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:43.119
so I'm going to carry on
with our work,

01:16:43.154 --> 01:16:44.820
I'm gonna finish our book,

01:16:44.856 --> 01:16:46.055
I'm gonna make more videos

01:16:46.091 --> 01:16:48.824
of all the creative projects
and designs

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.395
we were so excited
to do together.

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.763
Stay tuned.

01:16:53.798 --> 01:16:57.633
<i>â™ª Goodbye, my friend... â™ª</i>

01:16:59.737 --> 01:17:01.670
Awe, that was lovely, Cara.
Well done.

01:17:01.706 --> 01:17:02.738
Thank you.

01:17:02.807 --> 01:17:04.173
Ah, thank you.

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:05.108
It does my heart good to know
that Poppy's creativity

01:17:05.143 --> 01:17:07.076
is going to live on.

01:17:07.112 --> 01:17:09.812
And so will her
wonderful designs.

01:17:09.847 --> 01:17:12.315
So you're alright if I upload
this video tonight?

01:17:12.384 --> 01:17:13.783
That would be wonderful.

01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:15.718
Ok.

01:17:15.753 --> 01:17:18.587
Well, um, we should get going.

01:17:18.623 --> 01:17:19.455
Thanks for coming by.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:20.290
Bye, thank you.

01:17:20.358 --> 01:17:21.991
It was great seeing you all.

01:17:22.394 --> 01:17:23.960
Thank you.

01:17:26.197 --> 01:17:27.563
<i>Wow.</i>

01:17:30.701 --> 01:17:35.204
Marv, isn't that a different
logo than Poppy's other videos?

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.808
The logo from the company
she started with you.

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:40.910
So it is.

01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:43.679
Well, Cara just said that she's
going to continue on her own.

01:17:43.714 --> 01:17:46.149
We're ok with that.

01:17:46.217 --> 01:17:47.550
I gotta go.

01:17:47.585 --> 01:17:48.818
Wait, what?

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:55.058
But Cara talked like she made
the decision today

01:17:55.093 --> 01:17:57.327
to continue the business
without Poppy

01:17:57.362 --> 01:17:59.862
but she already
had her logo made?

01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:03.066
So she's been thinking
about it a while.

01:18:03.134 --> 01:18:04.467
Ok, here it is.

01:18:04.502 --> 01:18:06.569
<i>This is the video</i>
<i>that Poppy showed me.</i>

01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:13.309
<i>See? This logo is different</i>
<i>than the one I just saw.</i>

01:18:13.378 --> 01:18:14.610
It's Poppy Wilson with another
great way

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:17.046
you can use embroidery to make
your wardrobe pop.

01:18:17.115 --> 01:18:18.448
<i>I wanna look at Cara</i>
<i>more carefully.</i>

01:18:20.952 --> 01:18:22.385
<i>Ok. Here's the part where</i>
<i>Cara demonstrates</i>

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.354
<i>what Poppy is saying.</i>

01:18:28.026 --> 01:18:28.924
[gasps]

01:18:28.994 --> 01:18:30.360
Cara's left-handed.

01:18:36.401 --> 01:18:39.268
We should make a toast
to Poppy.

01:18:39.304 --> 01:18:40.436
Yeah, we should.

01:18:40.472 --> 01:18:41.504
That'd be nice.

01:18:41.539 --> 01:18:42.538
Uh, corkscrew?

01:18:42.573 --> 01:18:44.340
Oh, uh... in that drawer.

01:18:47.778 --> 01:18:50.179
Did you find it?

01:18:50.215 --> 01:18:51.947
Weird scissors.

01:18:53.918 --> 01:18:55.418
<i>I know Cara uses hers</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

01:18:55.487 --> 01:18:57.120
<i>Now what I've done is</i>
<i>I've just printed off</i>

01:18:57.155 --> 01:18:58.921
<i>a few different patterns from-</i>

01:18:58.956 --> 01:19:00.423
Wait, look!

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.892
It's a serrated blade.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.296
A blade that's about the same
length as a steak knife.

01:19:07.365 --> 01:19:08.664
I gotta call Jason.

01:19:08.699 --> 01:19:10.266
[ringing]

01:19:10.301 --> 01:19:12.601
I've never seen scissors
like this before.

01:19:12.637 --> 01:19:15.071
[phone ringing]

01:19:15.106 --> 01:19:16.339
Like they're serrated.

01:19:16.374 --> 01:19:17.540
Really?

01:19:17.608 --> 01:19:21.710
Yeah, every seamstress
has a pair like that.

01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:22.678
Hey Roe, I'm at Cara's.

01:19:22.713 --> 01:19:24.514
I just--

01:19:24.916 --> 01:19:25.915
Jason!

01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:28.351
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:19:28.386 --> 01:19:30.553
Jason!

01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:31.620
He's in trouble.

01:19:31.656 --> 01:19:34.023
Ok, call Arthur,
tell him that we think

01:19:34.059 --> 01:19:35.858
Cara's the one
that killed Poppy,

01:19:35.893 --> 01:19:37.593
and tell him Jason's with her
and he's in danger.

01:19:37.628 --> 01:19:38.361
I'll call.

01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.495
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:19:39.564 --> 01:19:40.596
I'm only three blocks
from Cara's place.

01:19:40.631 --> 01:19:42.331
I'll get there faster
than the police.

01:19:42.367 --> 01:19:44.267
Ok, well you can't go alone!

01:19:44.302 --> 01:19:45.401
Yes, ok.

01:19:45.437 --> 01:19:46.936
I understand.

01:19:48.806 --> 01:19:52.775
[moans]

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:53.876
Thank you.

01:19:57.048 --> 01:20:00.849
You have no idea how mad
I am at myself right now.

01:20:00.885 --> 01:20:02.318
Why did I put those scissors
back in the drawer

01:20:02.353 --> 01:20:04.520
after I washed them?

01:20:04.589 --> 01:20:07.090
After everything
was going so well.

01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:09.825
No one suspected me.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:12.295
That's one good thing
about being

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:14.597
a non-entity to most people.

01:20:14.665 --> 01:20:19.735
No one thinks you'd do something
so crazy as to kill someone.

01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:24.873
Even my best friend didn't give
me credit for anything I did.

01:20:24.909 --> 01:20:28.043
Even my own best friend
treated me as an after thought.

01:20:28.079 --> 01:20:30.613
She had no problem sucking
in all the money

01:20:30.648 --> 01:20:34.750
while I did most of the work.

01:20:34.785 --> 01:20:38.754
But then I found out how much
money that was gonna be.

01:20:38.789 --> 01:20:41.524
I had a problem with that.

01:20:41.559 --> 01:20:45.628
So I fixed that problem,

01:20:45.663 --> 01:20:50.065
and now you're a problem
I'm gonna have to fix.

01:20:58.643 --> 01:21:02.578
Which is too bad
because I really did like you.

01:21:10.688 --> 01:21:11.521
Jay!

01:21:11.589 --> 01:21:12.588
<i>Jason!</i>

01:21:13.424 --> 01:21:14.423
[struggling]

01:21:16.327 --> 01:21:17.460
<i>Oh Roe, be careful!</i>

01:21:17.495 --> 01:21:20.896
[struggling]

01:21:20.931 --> 01:21:22.632
[glass shatters]

01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:26.101
Cara?

01:21:26.137 --> 01:21:27.069
What do you think you're doing?

01:21:27.104 --> 01:21:29.205
Cara, you have to stop.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.340
This doesn't concern you.

01:21:34.379 --> 01:21:35.578
[yelps]

01:21:35.613 --> 01:21:37.012
<i>Police! Freeze!</i>

01:21:37.048 --> 01:21:38.814
Cara, put your hands up!

01:21:41.219 --> 01:21:43.719
You can put the chair down now,
Roe.

01:21:43.788 --> 01:21:46.489
I think you'll find the murder
weapon over there.

01:21:46.558 --> 01:21:49.058
You're under arrest for
the murder of Poppy Wilson.

01:21:49.093 --> 01:21:50.226
Jason, are you ok?

01:21:50.295 --> 01:21:51.594
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:52.628
Roe, are you ok?

01:21:52.664 --> 01:21:54.530
Yeah.

01:21:54.566 --> 01:21:57.500
Let's get you to the hospital,
get your head checked out.

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:14.883
Roe, what've you got in here,
books or cement?

01:22:14.919 --> 01:22:16.952
Woah, hey, you're
holding up traffic.

01:22:16.987 --> 01:22:18.187
It's fine.

01:22:18.256 --> 01:22:19.589
Here you go.

01:22:19.624 --> 01:22:21.357
You guys, thank you, I really
appreciate your help.

01:22:21.392 --> 01:22:22.525
The least we could do.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.659
You helped us out of
some pretty hot water.

01:22:23.695 --> 01:22:25.160
You definitely did.

01:22:25.196 --> 01:22:27.396
We did find the missing
steak knife, by the way.

01:22:27.432 --> 01:22:28.997
Yeah, it had just gone
under the refrigerator.

01:22:29.033 --> 01:22:30.499
Oh.

01:22:30.535 --> 01:22:33.168
But we have decided to make
you an honorary bridesmaid, Roe.

01:22:33.238 --> 01:22:34.203
Yeah, I told her
how much you love

01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:36.004
wearing a bridesmaid's dress.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.773
[laughs]

01:22:37.808 --> 01:22:40.309
Oh, if I didn't have to spend
so much time worrying about you

01:22:40.378 --> 01:22:42.211
I'd... I'd have more time
to tell you about

01:22:42.247 --> 01:22:43.812
how proud I am of you.

01:22:43.848 --> 01:22:45.581
Awe, thank you, mother.

01:22:47.652 --> 01:22:48.718
I was about to say
"I'll see you at home"

01:22:48.753 --> 01:22:51.387
but you're already home,
aren't you?

01:22:51.456 --> 01:22:52.955
<i>Mmmm.</i>

01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:54.590
<i>Oy. I need to get back</i>
<i>in the gym.</i>

01:22:56.193 --> 01:22:58.294
You know, I had felt alone
when Martin told me

01:22:58.329 --> 01:22:59.762
he may not be coming back.

01:22:59.797 --> 01:23:01.430
Oh, Roe.

01:23:01.466 --> 01:23:02.898
But I'm not alone.

01:23:02.933 --> 01:23:04.032
No, you're not.

01:23:04.068 --> 01:23:07.236
I have a great mother,
great friends,

01:23:07.272 --> 01:23:10.072
I have a job I love
and a brand new house.

01:23:10.141 --> 01:23:11.974
I'm feeling pretty lucky.
