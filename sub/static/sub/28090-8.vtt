WEBVTT

00:01.525 --> 00:03.264
- Agent Chase.
- Sir?

00:03.289 --> 00:05.225
- In my office.
- Yes, sir.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.616
Will, you're one of our best agents.

00:07.641 --> 00:10.038
Your mission is to pick up Standish,

00:10.063 --> 00:12.397
bring him back to Paris within 48 hours.

00:12.820 --> 00:14.120
Can I help you?

00:14.145 --> 00:15.244
I'm Todd.

00:15.269 --> 00:16.352
And this is my desk.

00:16.376 --> 00:18.649
- I've been working at this desk for a while now.
- Of course you have.

00:18.673 --> 00:20.640
You just swoop in and
take whatever you want,

00:20.665 --> 00:22.732
because that's what Americans do.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.793
Susan, right? Will's bestie.

00:24.818 --> 00:26.378
Listen, Will's not answering his phone.

00:26.403 --> 00:27.435
I thought you might...

00:27.460 --> 00:28.521
I don't know where he is.

00:28.546 --> 00:30.584
Wow, you are a terrible liar.

00:30.609 --> 00:32.676
And I don't think I like you, Ray.

00:33.757 --> 00:35.190
Edgar Standish.

00:35.215 --> 00:36.914
Let's take a look at that tooth.

00:39.033 --> 00:40.834
You've been selling
the weapons that we seize.

00:40.858 --> 00:43.458
That's why you sent me
to bring back Standish.

00:43.483 --> 00:45.150
Because of you,

00:45.175 --> 00:47.075
I'm gonna have to kill all these people.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.300
Aah!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:13.821 --> 01:15.220
There's no time left.

01:15.222 --> 01:16.688
This has to happen now.

01:18.725 --> 01:20.592
We need to pick names...

01:22.128 --> 01:23.295
for Secret Santa.

01:25.055 --> 01:26.264
I'm not crazy, right?

01:26.289 --> 01:27.877
It's an odd time to celebrate Christmas.

01:27.901 --> 01:29.568
Well, the holidays are our busiest time,

01:29.570 --> 01:31.069
so we celebrate in the off season.

01:31.071 --> 01:33.705
This is a Supplemental Holiday
for Espionage Professionals.

01:33.707 --> 01:35.674
I'm calling it SHEP.

01:35.676 --> 01:36.987
Or Spy Christmas.

01:37.012 --> 01:38.027
Yeah, I'm a Hindu.

01:38.052 --> 01:39.728
Guys, I love everything about Christmas.

01:39.753 --> 01:42.434
Ooh, hey! Tonight, after this,
you want to come over to my place,

01:42.459 --> 01:43.558
help me decorate my tree?

01:43.583 --> 01:45.237
You're kidding, right?

01:45.262 --> 01:46.597
Yes. Of course I'm kidding.

01:46.622 --> 01:48.622
I don't have a-a tree
that stays up all year.

01:48.647 --> 01:50.279
How did you get stuck with Secret Santa?

01:50.304 --> 01:51.470
You lose a bet?

01:51.495 --> 01:52.995
Well, as I'm sure you're all aware,

01:53.020 --> 01:55.301
I sometimes have problems
connecting with...

01:56.497 --> 01:57.662
people.

01:57.664 --> 01:58.930
"No, Jai, you're delightful."

01:58.932 --> 02:00.771
But I have been trying. That's true.

02:00.796 --> 02:02.276
He came up to me
yesterday out of the blue

02:02.300 --> 02:04.000
and asked me how I was doing.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.701
He didn't stick around
for the answer, but...

02:07.336 --> 02:09.002
I was fine, by the way.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.737
And now the cliffhanger is over.

02:11.762 --> 02:13.618
See, I've been making
really good progress,

02:13.643 --> 02:17.154
but Susan, here, feels
I need to open myself up

02:17.179 --> 02:19.720
to more workplace bonding activities.

02:19.745 --> 02:20.751
I'm so excited.

02:20.776 --> 02:23.577
I called it "making
friends," but whatever.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.668
You got to have love in your heart

02:25.693 --> 02:28.226
for everyone that you work with.

02:28.251 --> 02:29.265
"Ray"?

02:29.290 --> 02:30.708
- Hell no. I want a diff...
- Nope.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.068
Briefcase is now closed.

02:32.093 --> 02:34.426
30 bucks or less. No gag gifts.

02:34.451 --> 02:35.951
Happy SHEP, everyone.

02:38.232 --> 02:39.867
You know, I got
a Christmas sweater at home

02:39.891 --> 02:40.912
with your name on it.

02:40.937 --> 02:41.951
Do you?

02:41.976 --> 02:43.024
Yeah.

02:43.049 --> 02:44.241
My aunt's name is Tina.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.039
She left it there one time.

02:47.274 --> 02:49.969
That went from sexy to not sexy
at all real quick, didn't it?

02:49.994 --> 02:51.226
Yes, it did.

02:51.828 --> 02:53.446
You're still cute, though.

02:53.448 --> 02:55.748
I'll see you in a few days.
I got a mission in Miami.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.469
Ooh, Miami.

02:57.494 --> 02:58.952
Cool. What is it?

02:58.954 --> 03:00.120
Same ol', same ol'.

03:00.122 --> 03:01.921
Some corrupt billionaire playboy.

03:01.923 --> 03:04.020
I gotta seduce him
to get some bank codes.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.311
See you later.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.721
All right.

03:10.961 --> 03:12.661
She just say "seduce"?

03:14.044 --> 03:15.878
Frankie, you're an agent

03:16.271 --> 03:18.420
who's made some questionable
decisions in the field.

03:18.445 --> 03:20.568
- Yeah.
- Seducing is, like, an...

03:20.671 --> 03:22.437
over-the-pants thing, right?

03:22.634 --> 03:25.535
I-It's no different than if
you were dating... an actress

03:25.560 --> 03:27.087
and she had to do a romantic love scene.

03:27.111 --> 03:28.511
Right.

03:28.536 --> 03:30.674
Nothing to be concerned
about because it's fake.

03:30.699 --> 03:31.980
No, I'm saying that sometimes

03:32.005 --> 03:34.139
you actually have to have
sex to make it look real.

03:38.798 --> 03:40.065
Too mean?

03:40.090 --> 03:41.097
Yeah.

03:41.122 --> 03:42.722
But so good.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.816
Y'know the mistake Standish is making?

03:47.841 --> 03:49.136
Look, if you're dating someone

03:49.161 --> 03:50.628
and you want the relationship
to have a chance,

03:50.652 --> 03:53.175
you have to trust
that person completely.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.067
Mnh, that's not a thing.

03:55.092 --> 03:56.328
It's a thing.

03:56.353 --> 03:57.646
I know it's your favorite topic,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.650
but no one trusts anyone completely.

03:59.808 --> 04:01.142
I trust you completely.

04:01.167 --> 04:02.206
No, you don't.

04:03.522 --> 04:05.656
All the "shady" things from my past,

04:05.681 --> 04:08.181
the way I make rash
decisions on the fly?

04:08.523 --> 04:10.390
I don't even know what
I'm doing half the time.

04:10.392 --> 04:13.067
Why are you trying
to convince me not to trust you?

04:13.092 --> 04:14.625
I'm making a point.

04:14.874 --> 04:16.373
I mean, let's hypothetically say

04:16.398 --> 04:17.772
years from now, we're married.

04:17.797 --> 04:19.697
Okay, how... how...
how would that happen?

04:19.721 --> 04:20.855
Just go with it.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.680
So, you think that we're happy.

04:22.705 --> 04:24.274
And then you come home one day

04:24.299 --> 04:26.199
and I'm wearing a sexy nightgown

04:26.224 --> 04:28.892
and there's a handsome
stranger in the bathtub.

04:29.065 --> 04:30.631
Do I still have your complete trust?

04:30.656 --> 04:33.790
Yep. Because I'm sure there's
some reasonable explanation.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.971
Like what?

04:34.996 --> 04:37.296
Okay, he was working out in the back,

04:37.321 --> 04:38.745
and he fell through the ice in our pond.

04:38.769 --> 04:41.134
And, yes, we have a pond.

04:41.159 --> 04:42.705
So you took him inside,

04:42.730 --> 04:44.497
you put him in the bath
just to get him warm,

04:44.522 --> 04:45.924
and you got your clothes wet,
so you had to take them off.

04:45.948 --> 04:48.210
And, no, you did not have
a nightgown on underneath,

04:48.235 --> 04:49.908
because that would just be ridiculous,

04:49.933 --> 04:51.733
but you put on my favorite nightgown

04:51.758 --> 04:53.073
'cause you knew I was coming home

04:53.097 --> 04:55.232
and because you have this kinky thing

04:55.257 --> 04:57.891
where you like to have sex while
someone else is in the house.

04:59.905 --> 05:00.971
You're insane.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.762
Yeah, but in a good way?

05:03.339 --> 05:06.775
Hey, party people! Ray is in the house.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.933
Okay, Ray.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.707
Before you hooked up with Gigi,

05:09.732 --> 05:11.265
did Will trust you completely?

05:11.451 --> 05:13.050
He did.

05:13.075 --> 05:14.808
And thanks for bringing that up.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.660
No one's talked about it in a while.

05:16.685 --> 05:19.324
Anyway, I come bearing mission!

05:19.349 --> 05:20.515
Who's excited?

05:20.829 --> 05:22.128
Okay.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.800
Love doing that.

05:27.802 --> 05:31.776
So, the team needs to head
to Europe for a prisoner transfer.

05:31.801 --> 05:33.870
This guy may have intel on The Trust.

05:33.895 --> 05:35.504
I hate that they call
themselves "The Trust."

05:35.528 --> 05:37.361
I know. It's an important word to Will.

05:37.386 --> 05:38.661
I'm aware.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.319
Okay, prisoner transport. Why us?

05:40.344 --> 05:43.994
Well, because MI6, CIA, FBI,
they've all been infiltrated.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.985
And the more we learn about The Trust,

05:45.987 --> 05:47.167
the more we see their fingerprints

05:47.191 --> 05:48.624
on global terror events.

05:50.274 --> 05:52.942
We're afraid they're
planning something huge.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.567
EUROPOL thinks that this prisoner

05:54.592 --> 05:56.173
may be the best chance to figure out

05:56.198 --> 05:58.913
when and where the next
attack will take place.

05:58.938 --> 06:00.771
All right, so what's
our job on the ground?

06:00.796 --> 06:02.929
You will be escorting
him from a black site

06:02.954 --> 06:06.084
to a private airstrip where he will
be transferred for interrogation.

06:06.109 --> 06:08.710
You two will be in one of
the follow cars with Standish.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.001
It's a babysitting gig.

06:10.026 --> 06:11.140
No, no, no, no.

06:11.165 --> 06:13.287
This is a very high-level operation

06:13.312 --> 06:14.447
that requires the utmo...

06:14.449 --> 06:16.106
Okay, yes, it's a babysitting gig.

06:17.256 --> 06:19.319
But at least you guys
will be back in time

06:19.321 --> 06:22.121
for the Spy Christmas party in the Hive.

06:22.123 --> 06:23.756
All right, let's get
the team ready to roll.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.240
Hey, I still don't understand

06:25.265 --> 06:27.065
how we ended up getting married.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.489
You had a rich uncle who died,

06:28.514 --> 06:30.034
and I married you for the inheritance.

06:33.558 --> 06:34.799
Well, that's dirty.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.858
I never know what's going on.

07:10.451 --> 07:12.605
Hey, Tina. Hey, it's me.

07:12.607 --> 07:16.210
Just wanted to call,
say hi, and I missed you.

07:17.112 --> 07:19.912
You're probably busy seducing that guy.

07:19.914 --> 07:21.547
It's all good, though.

07:21.549 --> 07:23.449
I'm not worried about it. You know.

07:23.451 --> 07:25.318
You got to do what you got
to do for your country, right?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.086
I'm doing the same thing here in France.

07:27.088 --> 07:28.454
But not the... you know, the same thing.

07:28.456 --> 07:29.956
That'd be weird, right?

07:29.958 --> 07:32.979
Both of us on missions doing sex things.

07:33.004 --> 07:35.411
But, yeah, hope it's going well.

07:35.436 --> 07:36.535
Is that your fault?

07:36.560 --> 07:37.926
I got to go here,

07:37.951 --> 07:40.560
but good luck with the seducing.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.320
I'll talk to you later. All right.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.077
My God.

07:46.102 --> 07:48.269
Standish! Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

07:58.391 --> 08:00.692
So, who is this prisoner, anyway?

08:00.717 --> 08:02.317
No idea.

08:02.342 --> 08:04.090
Ray said EUROPOL is
so worried about leaks,

08:04.115 --> 08:06.555
they haven't even released his
identity at the highest levels.

08:45.006 --> 08:46.805
Ollerman?

08:49.223 --> 08:50.624
No way.

08:50.766 --> 08:52.866
Why is he still alive?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.467
Nice to see you all, too.

08:56.513 --> 08:58.580
They told you I died, didn't they?

08:58.605 --> 08:59.806
See?

08:59.831 --> 09:02.576
That's the problem with having
all these secrets in my head.

09:02.601 --> 09:04.868
I'm worth too much.

09:04.893 --> 09:06.993
That, and your aim sucks.

09:07.018 --> 09:09.352
How about we just finish this right now?

09:09.377 --> 09:12.018
All right. Let's just stay calm.

09:12.043 --> 09:13.442
Take some deep breaths, all right?

09:13.467 --> 09:15.104
What do you mean? He tried to kill us.

09:15.129 --> 09:17.229
Why would they even assign
us to pick him up, anyway?

09:17.254 --> 09:19.187
He pulled my tooth out with pliers.

09:19.212 --> 09:20.310
It was a fake tooth.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.520
It's still messed up.
Don't diminish my trauma.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.621
Guys, look, I don't know
why we got this mission.

09:24.646 --> 09:25.660
It doesn't matter.

09:25.685 --> 09:26.817
We have a job to do,

09:26.842 --> 09:28.236
and we're gonna finish
it like we always do.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.459
Agreed?

09:29.484 --> 09:31.784
Agent Chase done with his pep talk?

09:31.809 --> 09:33.976
I always used to love those.

09:34.460 --> 09:35.594
Shall we?

09:35.619 --> 09:37.352
We do have a schedule to keep.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.750
So, the Boy Scout partnered
with the sociopath.

09:46.775 --> 09:47.783
How's that working out?

09:47.808 --> 09:49.196
It's going really well,
for your information.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.352
Hey, not helping.

09:50.377 --> 09:51.425
Why don't you just get in the van

09:51.449 --> 09:52.828
before I do something I'm gonna regret?

09:52.852 --> 09:55.686
Come on, Will.
That's not your speed.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.498
Yeah, but it's her speed.

10:00.523 --> 10:01.756
Let's roll.

10:36.206 --> 10:38.993
Hey! Merry Spy Christmas.

10:39.018 --> 10:40.985
Ooh, and a Merry Spy Christmas.

10:40.987 --> 10:42.135
Yes, hi.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.389
And a Merry Spy
Christmas to you, mister.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.311
You don't get a candy
cane if you don't smile.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.279
Fine.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.198
God, I can't do this anymore.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.367
- Hey, Susan.
- Hey.

10:56.369 --> 10:58.192
Please don't make me
talk to anyone else.

10:58.217 --> 10:59.537
Please.

10:59.539 --> 11:01.038
How long have you even tried?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.733
It's not about how long I tried,

11:02.758 --> 11:04.892
it's about the effort that I put in.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.316
Less than a minute.

11:06.341 --> 11:07.807
Well...

11:07.947 --> 11:09.215
I can't really judge you.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.292
I still haven't gotten
Ray his Secret Santa gift,

11:11.317 --> 11:14.852
so I'm... I'm wrapping
up this stapler I found.

11:14.854 --> 11:16.220
Okay.

11:16.222 --> 11:18.055
Have you... Have you
seen any of the team?

11:18.057 --> 11:20.858
Not a word. No, it's
full security protocol.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.326
Wow.

11:22.328 --> 11:24.328
This must be a highly classified asset.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.230
They've been on complete
electronic blackout

11:26.232 --> 11:28.332
since they left here.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.008
You haven't seen my
stapler around, have you?

11:30.032 --> 11:31.035
Ooh.

11:31.037 --> 11:32.970
No, Todd.

11:32.972 --> 11:34.372
It's just that that poorly wrapped gift

11:34.374 --> 11:36.674
is the exact shape of my stapler.

11:36.676 --> 11:38.843
No, it's not.

11:38.845 --> 11:41.178
This is a...

11:41.180 --> 11:45.016
a toy bus that I
bought for my nephew.

11:49.756 --> 11:53.057
Thank you so much. It's
exactly what I wanted.

11:53.892 --> 11:55.393
Brits.

11:56.695 --> 11:57.829
Hey!

11:58.531 --> 12:00.865
You think Ray would like an empty cup?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.033
Yeah, absolutely.

12:02.035 --> 12:03.634
I can decorate it.

12:03.636 --> 12:04.902
Write his name on it.

12:04.904 --> 12:06.637
- "Ray."
- Yeah.

12:06.639 --> 12:08.339
"Ray's cup."

12:27.125 --> 12:28.292
How we doing?

12:28.294 --> 12:29.927
Checking the satellite.

12:29.929 --> 12:31.729
Airspace... clear.

12:31.731 --> 12:32.997
Road... clear.

12:32.999 --> 12:34.665
Electronic signature still invisible.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.700
We are all good.

12:45.510 --> 12:46.944
What the hell?!

12:56.823 --> 12:58.022
Shooter, 1100!

12:58.024 --> 12:59.457
Hold on!

13:01.727 --> 13:03.227
Get down!

13:05.130 --> 13:07.198
Everyone out of the car!

13:13.873 --> 13:15.439
Aah!

13:16.642 --> 13:18.242
Standish, stay down!

13:18.244 --> 13:19.643
Shooter up top.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.455
We're never gonna make
the Christmas party.

13:31.457 --> 13:33.991
Nobody shows up to
those things on time, anyway.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.331
We got to get to the van
before Ollerman gets killed.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.433
Right. Hey, you can leave
that thing here?

13:42.435 --> 13:44.769
I don't go anywhere without my laptop!

13:44.771 --> 13:46.337
Okay.

13:46.339 --> 13:47.972
I think Standish is in shock.

13:47.974 --> 13:49.235
All right, follow my lead.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.308
- Standish, cover us.
- Aah!

14:06.525 --> 14:07.758
God.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.798
Frankie, you check the cargo.

14:09.823 --> 14:11.156
Standish, you cover me, okay?

14:11.158 --> 14:12.291
Here we go.

14:22.502 --> 14:23.868
Hey, we're never gonna
make it to the drop.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.603
I need you to reroute us to the Hive.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.706
This is exactly why I bring the laptop.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.558
That, and I got a lot of music
that I haven't backed up yet.

14:29.582 --> 14:30.628
Hang on.

14:45.054 --> 14:46.605
Sounds like a party out there.

14:46.630 --> 14:48.163
Shut up!

14:51.248 --> 14:52.449
Last time I saw you,

14:52.474 --> 14:54.574
you were on a kitchen
table bleeding out.

14:54.599 --> 14:56.999
I wish I could say the same.

14:57.024 --> 14:58.690
Hey, Will, good news.

14:58.715 --> 15:00.849
Prince Charming's still with us.

15:00.874 --> 15:02.140
Great.

15:20.918 --> 15:22.514
Last year, all they put out

15:22.539 --> 15:24.575
was boxed wine and gas station sushi.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.734
A lot of people got sick, including me.

15:26.736 --> 15:29.169
But I got my bathing
suit body back like...

15:29.171 --> 15:30.271
Whoo!

15:30.273 --> 15:32.039
Ooh! Tiny little hot dogs.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.741
Hey. Excuse me.

15:33.743 --> 15:35.175
Hey. They're back.

15:35.177 --> 15:36.710
Thank God.

15:36.712 --> 15:37.913
Let's get out of here.

15:53.663 --> 15:55.162
Son of a bitch.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.664
Whoa.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.836
The devil is a lot smaller
than I thought he was.

15:58.861 --> 16:00.361
- How did this happen?
- Ambush.

16:00.363 --> 16:01.695
And until they can get
Ollerman out of here,

16:01.697 --> 16:03.764
our orders are to question him on site,

16:03.766 --> 16:05.266
see what he knows.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.101
Susan, you're up.

16:07.103 --> 16:09.437
Interrogation room. Let's go.

16:09.439 --> 16:12.406
And if he moves, shoot him.

16:17.246 --> 16:18.882
This is my chance for revenge.

16:18.907 --> 16:20.104
I'm-a rip his tooth out.

16:20.129 --> 16:21.462
Nobody's ripping anything.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.254
Hey, man, wasn't your tooth a fake?

16:23.279 --> 16:24.496
We've already been over this.

16:24.521 --> 16:26.454
- It was very traumatic and very painful!
- Ooh.

16:26.479 --> 16:29.396
Look, we all need to know not
to talk about Ollerman to anyone.

16:29.421 --> 16:31.467
Especially not Ray. He
cannot know that he's here.

16:31.492 --> 16:32.926
That's right. Ollerman shot him.

16:32.950 --> 16:33.959
Yeah, it was bad.

16:33.984 --> 16:35.684
There were a couple nights
I was sitting in his hospital room,

16:35.708 --> 16:36.921
I didn't think he was gonna make it.

16:36.945 --> 16:39.244
Hold on. You... You
were at Ray's bedside?

16:39.269 --> 16:41.136
- Does he know that?
- No.

16:41.161 --> 16:42.560
Is he ever going to?

16:43.292 --> 16:44.359
What do you think?

16:44.384 --> 16:45.984
I'm guessing "no."

16:46.009 --> 16:48.276
Guys, I need you back here.

16:48.325 --> 16:49.591
That was fast, Suze.

16:49.616 --> 16:51.182
He says he won't talk to me.

16:51.207 --> 16:53.073
He'll only talk to you two.

16:53.098 --> 16:54.631
All right. Let's go.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.782
So, was it this tooth
right here? This one?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.333
There you are.

17:09.089 --> 17:10.454
I hear you requested us?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.990
No offense to Susan,

17:12.015 --> 17:13.531
I just feel like the three of us

17:13.556 --> 17:15.164
have more chemistry.

17:15.189 --> 17:16.588
Guys, keep him relaxed.

17:16.613 --> 17:18.512
We need him to feel comfortable.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.538
Start by being overly friendly.

17:20.563 --> 17:23.297
I'd like to put a bullet
in that smug face of yours.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.338
Why do I even bother?

17:25.339 --> 17:28.165
- I mean, we were all thinking it.
- Yeah, but...

17:28.190 --> 17:29.385
All right, let's start
with an easy question.

17:29.409 --> 17:30.478
How did your people know

17:30.503 --> 17:32.004
which route our convoy was gonna take?

17:32.028 --> 17:34.853
I must say, you two
are adorable together.

17:35.610 --> 17:37.610
The suppressed sexual tension.

17:37.635 --> 17:40.069
It's all right there, below the surface.

17:40.094 --> 17:41.370
We know you're a member of The Trust.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.062
We have intel that
something big is coming.

17:43.086 --> 17:44.854
- Talk.
- Funny, isn't it?

17:44.879 --> 17:47.813
Your little team was put
together because of me.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.462
Now I'm gonna tear you apart.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.899
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

17:51.924 --> 17:53.227
You're very confident

17:53.252 --> 17:55.821
for a man who officially
reported Agent Trowbridge

17:55.846 --> 18:00.148
as "dangerously unstable
and potentially disloyal."

18:01.885 --> 18:02.986
We had just met.

18:03.011 --> 18:05.011
And in my defense...

18:05.036 --> 18:06.335
it was true.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.293
Fair point.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.784
Then you joined forces with Jai Datta,

18:11.809 --> 18:13.042
Edgar Standish,

18:13.067 --> 18:16.235
and the infamous Dr. Susan Sampson.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.759
Agent Datta...

18:17.784 --> 18:20.785
I'm surprised you're
even still with them.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.042
I believe your dossier said,

18:23.067 --> 18:26.510
"Subject is prone to
isolation, rejects intimacy,"

18:26.535 --> 18:28.999
and lacks the ability
to connect with teammates

18:29.024 --> 18:31.524
"in any meaningful way."

18:31.954 --> 18:33.120
Susan, you're the author.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.012
Did I get your words right?

18:35.037 --> 18:36.419
Seriously?

18:36.444 --> 18:38.077
How does he know all of this?

18:38.372 --> 18:40.939
Enough. We're here to
talk about The Trust.

18:40.964 --> 18:43.215
Speaking of trust... Edgar.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.730
About your girlfriend, Agent Marek.

18:45.755 --> 18:48.088
Please be something good.
Please be something good.

18:48.370 --> 18:49.977
She's on a mission that requires

18:50.002 --> 18:52.636
a certain degree of erotic flexibility.

18:52.928 --> 18:55.621
Do you think your insecurity

18:55.646 --> 18:58.713
will drive you to do
something stupid and impulsive,

18:58.738 --> 19:02.440
given your propensity to self-sabotage?

19:03.770 --> 19:05.871
Probably. Yeah.

19:09.725 --> 19:11.391
I wouldn't start with me.

19:11.416 --> 19:12.533
I've had a day.

19:12.558 --> 19:14.792
There she is!

19:14.817 --> 19:17.651
The ruthless assassin.

19:17.872 --> 19:19.172
I'm so glad

19:19.197 --> 19:21.397
you didn't follow through
with that kill order.

19:25.996 --> 19:28.301
You didn't know?

19:28.326 --> 19:29.910
When you two first met,

19:29.935 --> 19:32.870
she had clearance to
"tie up loose ends" and...

19:32.895 --> 19:33.961
kill you.

19:34.831 --> 19:36.331
Let me clarify...

19:36.356 --> 19:40.058
she asked her superiors
for permission to kill you

19:40.083 --> 19:41.215
and got it.

19:41.577 --> 19:43.744
You're lucky she got shot,

19:43.769 --> 19:45.536
or you probably wouldn't be with us.

19:46.581 --> 19:50.083
I'm sorry, I've been
doing so much... talking.

19:50.085 --> 19:52.619
Is there any way I could
get a glass of water?

19:52.621 --> 19:54.386
Sure thing.

19:54.411 --> 19:56.444
I hope no one spits in it.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.636
It was a preliminary profile.

20:05.661 --> 20:07.153
You've changed so much since then.

20:07.178 --> 20:09.819
I will let you know when
we are speaking again.

20:09.844 --> 20:10.902
Okay.

20:10.927 --> 20:13.369
All the imaginary scenarios
of what Tina is doing right now

20:13.394 --> 20:14.476
are running through my head,

20:14.500 --> 20:15.951
and they're all erotic and flexible.

20:15.976 --> 20:17.476
- Very flexible.
- Standish...

20:17.500 --> 20:19.500
We've only kissed. I haven't
even seen her naked yet.

20:19.524 --> 20:20.656
That's not fair, right?

20:20.681 --> 20:21.718
Guys, please.

20:21.743 --> 20:24.528
Look, this is what Ollerman does, okay?

20:24.553 --> 20:26.773
He identifies and
exploits your insecurities.

20:26.798 --> 20:28.832
Do not let it get to you, okay?

20:28.857 --> 20:31.424
Look, do I wish that Frankie
hadn't planned my assassination?

20:31.449 --> 20:32.859
Of course I do. Who wouldn't?

20:32.884 --> 20:35.051
But I'm not gonna sit here
and let it dwell on me.

20:35.076 --> 20:36.576
No, because it was Moscow,

20:36.601 --> 20:38.234
it was winter, and we were all cranky.

20:38.259 --> 20:40.494
Eventually, I'm gonna need a
better explanation than that.

20:40.518 --> 20:42.957
Will is right. We can deal with this.

20:42.982 --> 20:44.582
As a team, we are that strong.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.799
As long as we remember
who we are, we got this.

20:46.824 --> 20:48.363
That's right. All right.
Let's get on it, okay?

20:48.387 --> 20:49.520
- Yeah.
- Incoming.

20:49.545 --> 20:51.373
All right. Do not tell Ray.

20:51.398 --> 20:53.630
- What?
- There's my team!

20:53.655 --> 20:55.502
Hey, hey, got good news...

20:55.527 --> 20:57.670
the Dutch analyst
brought a karaoke machine.

20:57.695 --> 21:00.062
Bad news... it's all in Dutch.

21:00.087 --> 21:02.447
Where are they going? What were
you guys just talking about?

21:03.844 --> 21:06.578
What we should be talking
about is that empty glass.

21:06.976 --> 21:08.881
No bueno. Right? You feel me?

21:08.906 --> 21:09.972
Mnh-mnh.

21:09.997 --> 21:11.696
I do.

21:11.721 --> 21:13.021
Ray Ray!

21:13.046 --> 21:16.113
I stashed a-a bottle of bourbon
under the coffee machine.

21:19.949 --> 21:21.148
Yeah.

21:21.173 --> 21:23.281
Mission accepted, fellas.

21:24.463 --> 21:25.963
Ray is on the job.

21:25.988 --> 21:27.487
- Yeah.
- Yeah, who's on the job?

21:27.512 --> 21:30.394
That's an easy one. It's Ray! Hey. Yeah.

21:30.425 --> 21:31.590
God.

21:31.592 --> 21:32.625
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

21:32.627 --> 21:33.659
Should we chest bump?

21:33.661 --> 21:34.827
That is unacceptable for me.

21:34.829 --> 21:36.829
- Subtle fist pound?
- Absolutely.

21:44.739 --> 21:45.971
What the hell are you doing?

21:45.973 --> 21:47.873
I'm looking for something

21:47.875 --> 21:51.744
that starts with a "B"
and ends with an "urban."

21:51.746 --> 21:53.612
And I can drink it.

21:53.614 --> 21:54.926
It's bourbon.

21:54.951 --> 21:57.151
Yeah. Yeah, I managed
to decipher your brilliant riddle.

21:58.486 --> 22:00.653
- Wow.
- What?

22:00.655 --> 22:02.221
Apparently, they just
brought a new prisoner in.

22:02.223 --> 22:03.789
Alex Ollerman.

22:06.394 --> 22:07.660
Did you just say Ollerman?

22:08.930 --> 22:10.796
Yeah. Why? Do you know him?

22:15.436 --> 22:16.821
The Trust.

22:16.846 --> 22:17.903
Your next attack.

22:17.905 --> 22:19.538
I want a date and a location.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.273
You know I can't tell you that.

22:21.275 --> 22:23.412
So, come on, let's hear it.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.560
How much ripple effect did
I cause for team Whiskey?

22:27.888 --> 22:30.015
Be honest. He'll know if you aren't.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.551
Well, we didn't exactly
have a group hug afterwards,

22:32.553 --> 22:34.487
but we're... we're still pretty solid.

22:34.489 --> 22:36.388
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

22:36.390 --> 22:37.742
I'm not gonna say it again...

22:37.766 --> 22:39.093
stop stonewalling.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.476
Look, you know she's right.

22:41.254 --> 22:43.287
They've got you on treason and murder.

22:43.312 --> 22:45.098
The only real choice you have

22:46.098 --> 22:49.098
is a gas chamber or lethal injection.

22:49.895 --> 22:52.129
And either way, we're gonna
make sure that your wife and son

22:52.153 --> 22:53.873
have a front-row seat.

22:54.908 --> 22:57.376
Alex, do yourself and
your family a favor.

22:57.912 --> 22:59.709
Help us help you.

23:00.959 --> 23:04.116
Look, talk, and I promise
you'll avoid the death penalty.

23:04.540 --> 23:06.252
You know me... I always keep my word.

23:06.649 --> 23:07.953
You do.

23:07.955 --> 23:09.655
It's endearing.

23:14.194 --> 23:15.694
Fine.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.166
Here's what I know.

23:22.470 --> 23:23.869
Ray. Ray, stop.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.174
Ray. Hey, Ray. Hey.

23:28.176 --> 23:29.675
- Ray!
- Hey, hey.

23:29.677 --> 23:31.277
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, stop it.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.411
Look at me. Look at me.

23:32.413 --> 23:33.767
Not this way.

23:35.883 --> 23:38.117
Come on. Get out of here.

23:44.825 --> 23:47.026
Enjoy the show, Susan?

23:47.028 --> 23:51.096
This isn't going to end
the way you want it to, Alex.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.965
You never know.

23:58.294 --> 24:01.539
If I had my gun, I would've
shot him in his smug face!

24:01.564 --> 24:03.290
Damn, Ray. First time
you looked attractive.

24:03.315 --> 24:04.481
Hey, not helping.

24:04.483 --> 24:05.683
Look, you need to cool down.

24:05.685 --> 24:07.851
Just calm down. Sit down, okay?

24:10.115 --> 24:12.716
Hey, do you remember that mission
we were on together in Brussels?

24:12.832 --> 24:14.272
Do you remember what you said to me?

24:15.061 --> 24:17.224
Crepes are just really thin pancakes.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.560
No. I mean, yes. Yes, they are.

24:19.585 --> 24:21.265
But I'm talking about when
the mission went south,

24:21.267 --> 24:24.635
when good people got hurt, and
when I totally lost my cool.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.659
What did you say?

24:26.305 --> 24:28.672
I told you not to lose
sight of the big picture.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.909
We're saving lives here, Ray.

24:31.911 --> 24:33.177
Okay? No matter what happens,

24:33.179 --> 24:34.912
you have to keep your head in the game.

24:34.914 --> 24:36.747
Copy that.

24:36.749 --> 24:38.649
All right. Cool off, come on.

24:40.585 --> 24:42.920
When he gets like this, he
can go right off the rails.

24:42.922 --> 24:44.121
We can't leave him alone.

24:44.123 --> 24:45.856
Way ahead of you.

24:45.858 --> 24:47.224
Got your text.

24:47.226 --> 24:48.792
We need you to babysit Ray.

24:48.794 --> 24:50.461
No, no, no, no.

24:50.463 --> 24:51.647
Keep him calm.

24:51.931 --> 24:52.975
Be there for him.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.433
Look, this is a bad idea.

24:56.435 --> 24:58.442
You heard Ollerman. I'm
terrible with people.

24:58.467 --> 25:00.170
You know what? Enough of this crap, Jai.

25:00.172 --> 25:01.540
Who'd you get for Secret Santa?

25:02.716 --> 25:03.915
I don't want to say.

25:03.940 --> 25:05.039
Seriously?

25:05.064 --> 25:06.410
Fine, it was Will.

25:06.412 --> 25:07.444
I got you a hat.

25:07.446 --> 25:09.788
- A hat?
- See? E-Exactly.

25:10.649 --> 25:12.449
It's an antique British bowler.

25:12.451 --> 25:13.726
I thought you might like it

25:13.751 --> 25:16.429
because it's symbolic of what
it means to be a gentleman,

25:16.454 --> 25:18.335
which I think you...
So stupid. Stupid, Jai.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.280
No, no. Jai, hey! Come
on. That's not stupid.

25:20.305 --> 25:23.134
That's very, first of all,
complimentary, and it's perfect,

25:23.159 --> 25:24.892
it's thoughtful, it's unique.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.282
I can't wait to wear it.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.074
See? You know him.

25:28.363 --> 25:30.029
You can connect with people.

25:30.054 --> 25:32.221
Jai, you have come so far.

25:35.521 --> 25:37.021
Thank you.

25:37.046 --> 25:38.301
Just keep an eye on him, okay?

25:42.244 --> 25:44.445
You're not gonna wear
that goofy hat, are you?

25:44.470 --> 25:45.804
No. What do you want me to say, though?

25:45.828 --> 25:48.028
I mean... a British bowler?

25:57.531 --> 25:59.598
Hey, guys, I think I got something.

25:59.623 --> 26:01.711
I sat down at this computer
to get some work done.

26:01.736 --> 26:03.035
What were you really doing?

26:03.320 --> 26:05.292
Okay, fine, I was trying
to hack the phone systems

26:05.317 --> 26:06.664
to delete my voicemail to Tina.

26:06.689 --> 26:07.820
- You happy?
- Very rarely.

26:07.845 --> 26:09.152
I can confirm that.

26:09.154 --> 26:10.487
I can appreciate you both.

26:10.489 --> 26:13.141
Like I said, I came here to undo
my "self-sabotaging tendencies,"

26:13.166 --> 26:15.166
and I think I found
a breach in the firewall.

26:15.191 --> 26:16.991
Someone's trying
to hack the security system.

26:17.016 --> 26:18.536
What, on the same day our guest arrived?

26:18.560 --> 26:19.825
That can't be a coincidence.

26:19.850 --> 26:21.669
I think you're right. The only thing is,

26:21.694 --> 26:24.529
the entry seems to be
coming from inside the Hive.

26:26.849 --> 26:29.150
Someone here is working with Ollerman.

26:29.309 --> 26:31.576
Keep digging. Find out who.

26:33.056 --> 26:35.479
All right, mole. Where's your hole?

26:36.215 --> 26:37.347
Some team.

26:37.372 --> 26:39.539
Couldn't even deliver my glass of water.

26:40.896 --> 26:42.563
I know that you think
that you're in control,

26:42.587 --> 26:44.549
that you're getting to us.

26:44.574 --> 26:45.611
You're not.

26:45.636 --> 26:46.735
I don't know.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.660
Ray seemed pretty "gotten to."

26:49.238 --> 26:51.135
And I'm betting
the other members of the team

26:51.160 --> 26:53.076
are all spinning like little tops.

26:53.101 --> 26:54.162
Enough.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.310
Let's get to The Trust.

26:56.335 --> 26:57.420
No.

26:57.445 --> 27:00.546
It's been fun, but that
little part of our Q&A is over.

27:01.034 --> 27:04.002
So now's the part where
I hurt you until you talk?

27:04.027 --> 27:05.968
No, I feel like there are
probably some other options

27:05.992 --> 27:07.392
we should exhaust first.

27:08.549 --> 27:10.549
Susan, you want to come in here?

27:17.127 --> 27:18.660
Susan?

27:19.723 --> 27:21.857
I'm afraid she's not there.

27:32.022 --> 27:33.488
Will.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.150
You're probably gonna
want to answer that.

27:36.804 --> 27:38.371
It's an important call.

27:43.881 --> 27:45.667
Will?

27:45.692 --> 27:47.992
Su...

27:51.900 --> 27:55.669
Now, how about you two uncuff
me and get me my damn water?

28:02.345 --> 28:07.182
I feel like you're making a really
big deal over a stapler, Todd.

28:09.847 --> 28:13.462
My gosh, yes,
you're absolutely right.

28:13.487 --> 28:15.335
Here, let me just release you.

28:18.239 --> 28:21.332
Or maybe I should just keep you here

28:21.357 --> 28:23.168
until Ollerman tells me to kill you.

28:26.386 --> 28:28.170
Which I will enjoy.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.646
Yeah.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.885
Now... new plan.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.888
I am gonna walk out of here,

28:46.722 --> 28:49.579
or Dr. Sampson dies.

28:49.604 --> 28:50.803
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

28:50.805 --> 28:55.241
I'm gonna need some new clothes, a gun.

28:55.243 --> 28:58.411
Also gonna need my ring
from the evidence locker.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.714
Family heirloom. I'm sentimental.

29:01.716 --> 29:03.149
You orchestrated this whole thing.

29:03.151 --> 29:06.252
Our team doing the pick-up,
the sniper... it was all you.

29:06.254 --> 29:07.256
I'd hurry.

29:07.281 --> 29:08.721
Susan's life is on the line.

29:08.723 --> 29:10.556
Tick tock, agents.

29:18.281 --> 29:19.346
This is all my fault.

29:19.371 --> 29:21.435
If I hadn't lost my cool, he wouldn't
have a chance to grab her.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.096
Look, we don't have
time for that, all right?

29:23.120 --> 29:24.927
As soon as Ollerman leaves
the building, Susan's dead.

29:24.951 --> 29:26.217
Okay. What's the plan?

29:26.242 --> 29:27.642
Find the mole, save Susan.

29:27.667 --> 29:28.925
Standish, how we doing?

29:28.950 --> 29:31.168
Dude, I'm running a tracer app
that cross-references the signal

29:31.192 --> 29:33.697
against all time-stamped user
logins in the last 24 hours,

29:33.722 --> 29:35.567
- but it's gonna take some time.
- Okay, I didn't understand

29:35.591 --> 29:36.820
any of that, but go faster.

29:36.845 --> 29:37.911
We'll try and stall Ollerman.

29:37.935 --> 29:39.335
All right, let's do this.

29:41.778 --> 29:43.006
I'm looking at CCTV footage

29:43.030 --> 29:44.436
of every camera around the building.

29:44.460 --> 29:45.654
They're all disabled.

29:45.679 --> 29:47.443
Did you check the internal cameras?

29:47.468 --> 29:49.034
Yeah, it's shut off, too.

29:51.515 --> 29:52.591
Ray.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.306
We're doing everything we can, man.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.163
Yeah, well, we got to do more.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.087
It's Todd.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.610
I've been digging through the mainframe,

30:02.634 --> 30:04.651
and the hack traces
back to his computer.

30:04.676 --> 30:06.210
He is the one that
told me about Ollerman.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.668
He had an alert on his smart watch.

30:08.693 --> 30:11.178
He has a smart watch. Amateur.

30:11.203 --> 30:12.507
All right, I'll be able
to track that signal.

30:12.531 --> 30:14.331
Get going. I'll send
you guys the coordinates.

30:15.608 --> 30:16.941
Look, Ollerman's smart.

30:16.966 --> 30:18.109
He's not gonna let us stall much longer.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.466
We've got to come up with a plan.

30:19.491 --> 30:20.958
He wants to break
this team apart, right?

30:20.982 --> 30:22.194
What if we let him?

30:22.219 --> 30:24.152
What if we make him think
one of us has turned?

30:24.177 --> 30:25.710
Right now, it's the best we've got.

30:25.735 --> 30:26.867
I'll do it, yeah.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.259
You go dark? Nobody would believe it.

30:28.283 --> 30:29.984
You've probably never
even stolen a pack of gum.

30:30.008 --> 30:31.519
Hey, I've stolen a pack of gum.

30:31.544 --> 30:32.643
- Really?
- Yes!

30:32.668 --> 30:35.035
I went back and paid for it, but...

30:35.060 --> 30:36.126
Look.

30:36.151 --> 30:37.185
You said it yourself...

30:37.210 --> 30:39.415
I'm dangerously unstable
and potentially disloyal.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.672
No, that was early on.

30:40.697 --> 30:42.176
You know that things have changed now.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.233
I do. But Ollerman doesn't.

30:44.258 --> 30:47.326
All he knows is you
can only tell the truth.

30:47.709 --> 30:49.076
All right, what are you thinking?

30:49.101 --> 30:52.068
Before I tell you, do
you trust me completely?

30:52.437 --> 30:54.004
Is this about the guy
in the bathtub again?

30:54.028 --> 30:55.294
'Cause that was weird.

30:55.319 --> 30:57.353
Will, do you trust me with your life?

30:57.575 --> 30:59.210
My life? That's a

30:59.235 --> 31:00.567
a bit of a leap, but...

31:00.592 --> 31:03.288
I do. Yeah.

31:03.313 --> 31:04.612
What's the plan?

31:14.523 --> 31:15.691
My ring?

31:17.763 --> 31:19.764
You really love this gaudy
little thing, don't you?

31:19.789 --> 31:21.890
And using your family motto

31:21.915 --> 31:24.649
as the codename for your
secret evil operation?

31:24.674 --> 31:26.807
Tell me, is everyone
in The Trust that stupid?

31:26.832 --> 31:27.965
Give it to me.

31:35.277 --> 31:37.611
Nice trick. What is that?

31:37.636 --> 31:40.170
A microchip with encrypted data records.

31:40.195 --> 31:42.430
Worth billions in secret bank accounts.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.672
Billions?

31:45.782 --> 31:47.383
So this whole thing was about money?

31:47.408 --> 31:49.174
Money is a means to an end.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.366
Our goal is instability. Chaos.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.533
Destroy the established order,

31:53.558 --> 31:56.259
and all the power and wealth
is just there for the taking.

31:56.284 --> 31:58.885
The Trust isn't just
planning one attack.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.827
We're planning dozens.

32:01.471 --> 32:04.005
But scale begets cost.

32:04.749 --> 32:06.468
Ambition isn't cheap.

32:06.493 --> 32:08.470
Yeah, you can't exactly
crowd fund terrorism.

32:08.495 --> 32:12.343
But with this, we're back in business.

32:13.227 --> 32:14.394
Thanks to you.

32:15.594 --> 32:16.884
I want in.

32:18.671 --> 32:19.971
Frankie, what are you talking about?

32:19.995 --> 32:22.065
Come on, you knew this was
gonna happen sooner or later.

32:22.089 --> 32:24.150
I mean, according to him,
you wrote it down.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.173
No. No, I'm not gonna let you do this.

32:26.198 --> 32:27.533
I'd like to see you stop me.

32:27.558 --> 32:29.058
I'll stop you if I have to.
What are you talking about?!

32:29.082 --> 32:33.551
Guys, guys. Sorry. I'm not buying it.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.077
I would be an asset to
you, and you know it.

32:36.102 --> 32:37.868
I don't care who I work for.

32:37.893 --> 32:39.393
As long as the checks clear.

32:40.311 --> 32:41.685
Frankie, come on!

32:41.710 --> 32:42.942
What are you doing?!

32:49.897 --> 32:51.197
Prove it.

32:53.481 --> 32:54.715
Frankie, what are you doing?

32:54.740 --> 32:55.972
No, don't prove anything.

32:55.997 --> 32:57.730
Frankie, put that away.

33:00.004 --> 33:01.870
God! Frankie!

33:01.895 --> 33:03.361
Happy?

33:03.386 --> 33:05.102
Not really. He's still breathing.

33:09.473 --> 33:11.374
Frankie. Aah.

33:11.399 --> 33:13.057
Maybe people don't change, Will.

33:13.082 --> 33:14.348
Are you crazy?

33:14.373 --> 33:15.906
Aah!

33:23.227 --> 33:24.826
I believe I asked for a gun?

33:36.865 --> 33:39.000
All right, then. Shall we?

33:49.291 --> 33:50.390
Will! You got shot?!

33:50.415 --> 33:51.514
How did Ollerman get a gun?

33:51.539 --> 33:53.005
Grab the chair.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.569
He didn't shoot me.

33:54.594 --> 33:55.609
Frankie did.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.033
I have so many questions.

33:57.058 --> 33:59.062
We agreed she'd shoot
me to prove she turned.

33:59.507 --> 34:01.594
That second one, that
took me by surprise.

34:01.619 --> 34:02.650
God.

34:02.675 --> 34:04.008
That answers none of my questions.

34:04.032 --> 34:05.231
Frankie's got great aim.

34:05.256 --> 34:06.357
This one's a through-and-through,

34:06.381 --> 34:07.567
the second one's just a graze.

34:07.591 --> 34:08.922
Hey, did you find Susan?

34:08.947 --> 34:10.380
Yeah... the data center nearby.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.391
Jai and Ray are en route.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.449
Are you sure you're okay?

34:12.475 --> 34:14.835
'Cause that's a lot of blood,
and I'm a little light-headed.

34:16.434 --> 34:18.034
Guys, we're at Susan's location.

34:18.059 --> 34:19.396
Is she okay?

34:19.420 --> 34:21.237
We don't know. We think
she's with multiple hostiles.

34:21.261 --> 34:24.027
We'll do a little recon, put
together a plan of attack.

34:24.030 --> 34:25.696
Yeah, look, Ollerman's on his way out.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.965
It's now or never. You got to go.

34:27.967 --> 34:30.063
That doesn't sound
like a great idea, man.

34:30.088 --> 34:31.125
No, it's not.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.188
It's not, Ray, but
I know you can do this.

34:33.213 --> 34:34.679
Ray, look...

34:34.705 --> 34:36.659
You're one of the best field
agents I've ever worked with.

34:36.684 --> 34:39.717
I can't count the number
of times you saved my ass.

34:39.743 --> 34:41.558
I mean, sometimes it didn't seem like

34:41.583 --> 34:43.138
you knew what the hell you were doing.

34:43.163 --> 34:44.201
'Cause I didn't.

34:44.226 --> 34:46.226
Yes, exactly, Ray.
That's your superpower.

34:46.686 --> 34:48.252
You know how to improvise, all right?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.121
Now just go save Susan.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.299
Okay.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.123
Um...

34:55.728 --> 34:57.741
When you hear shots, come in hot.

34:58.327 --> 34:59.994
What are you gonna do?

35:00.019 --> 35:01.185
I don't know.

35:01.210 --> 35:02.376
Okay.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.207
Hey, party people! What's up?

35:09.209 --> 35:10.508
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:10.510 --> 35:12.643
Easy, easy, easy,
easy. Hey, hey, fellas.

35:12.645 --> 35:14.011
Loosen up a little bit, okay?

35:14.013 --> 35:15.246
In through the nose,
out through the mouth,

35:15.248 --> 35:16.614
especially this guy.

35:16.616 --> 35:17.949
Henchman of the year.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.717
Todd! Good news.

35:19.719 --> 35:21.619
Ollerman's got the ring,
and he's on his way out.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.892
I kind of messed up.

35:22.917 --> 35:25.067
I asked him if he could grab
some beers if we finished early.

35:25.091 --> 35:27.491
He got mad, gave me those
crazy eyes... you know the ones.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.961
I know you know 'em because
you're always pushing his buttons.

35:29.963 --> 35:31.829
'Cause you're a rascal.

35:31.831 --> 35:33.497
Since when did you
become a part of this?

35:33.499 --> 35:34.832
When...

35:34.834 --> 35:38.703
Th... That... That's
a funny, funny story.

35:38.705 --> 35:40.037
I didn't.

35:49.375 --> 35:51.067
Don't come any closer. I'll kill her!

35:51.092 --> 35:53.327
Todd, do the math, buddy, okay?

35:53.352 --> 35:55.552
It's two against one. Put your gun down.

35:55.577 --> 35:56.943
Absolutely not.

35:56.968 --> 35:58.536
If I put my gun down,
you will just kill me.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.394
You drop yours, or she dies.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.034
Okay. All right, you win.

36:07.059 --> 36:08.292
All right? I'll go first.

36:08.317 --> 36:09.382
I'm putting it down.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.868
Look at me. Look at me.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.303
Look at me. I'm putting it down.

36:12.305 --> 36:14.305
Look at me. Look at me, Todd.

36:14.307 --> 36:16.073
I'm doing it.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.082
Should've watched us both, Todd.

36:25.084 --> 36:27.985
Standish is gonna be so
jealous I got to shoot Todd.

36:27.987 --> 36:29.353
- Tell Will we got her.
- Yep.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.922
Hey. You okay?

36:30.924 --> 36:32.356
Yeah. Wow.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.192
I really should've gotten
you a Secret Santa present.

36:37.562 --> 36:39.096
I did good, right?

36:39.098 --> 36:41.065
You did great, Ray.

36:43.006 --> 36:44.468
All right.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.871
Let's go.

36:58.184 --> 36:59.951
Curbside pickup.

36:59.953 --> 37:01.519
Is that a perk of the job?

37:01.544 --> 37:03.011
I'm not an idiot.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.339
I trained people like you.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.358
You didn't turn.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.094
I saw you look back at Chase.

37:09.629 --> 37:11.862
You can't hide how
much you care about him.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.699
Thanks for all your help.

37:15.101 --> 37:17.401
It's been fun finally
getting to know you.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.003
Bad news, Alex.

37:19.005 --> 37:20.838
We got Susan.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.907
No hostage, no leverage.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.476
Isn't this fun?

37:25.578 --> 37:27.011
Unfortunately for you,

37:27.013 --> 37:29.680
one person here doesn't have a gun.

37:36.189 --> 37:37.955
No matter how this plays out,

37:37.957 --> 37:40.224
I'm putting a bullet between your eyes.

37:40.226 --> 37:41.826
And you know me.

37:41.828 --> 37:43.954
You decide if I'm
telling the truth or not.

37:44.564 --> 37:46.397
I believe him.

37:51.535 --> 37:52.768
Tell you what.

37:54.014 --> 37:55.647
Her life for mine.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.308
Deal.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.509
No deal!

37:58.511 --> 37:59.844
He didn't ask you.

37:59.846 --> 38:01.679
Well, I feel like
I have a say in the matter.

38:01.681 --> 38:03.681
Well, feel like that all you want.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.150
Been great catching up.

38:06.152 --> 38:08.185
Till next time.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.337
You let him get away with the microchip.

38:25.362 --> 38:27.304
The Trust is gonna be
completely funded again.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.433
No, it isn't.

38:28.458 --> 38:30.024
Ollerman was never a sentimental type.

38:30.176 --> 38:31.876
I knew he wouldn't care about
some stupid piece of jewelry

38:31.878 --> 38:33.360
unless it was important, so...

38:33.385 --> 38:34.851
I switched it out.

38:35.515 --> 38:36.915
Probably should've told you.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.817
So what did you put on it instead?

38:39.819 --> 38:41.452
Photos of me at Disneyland.

38:41.454 --> 38:42.787
My friends and I were
on Splash Mountain.

38:42.789 --> 38:43.939
We were playing chess.

38:43.964 --> 38:45.523
He probably won't appreciate the bit,

38:45.525 --> 38:47.158
- but, you know.
- I do.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.325
Thank you.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.027
I can't believe you shot me.

38:50.029 --> 38:52.196
Suck it up. You said it was okay.

38:53.187 --> 38:55.322
Maybe slow down. Come on.

38:55.347 --> 38:56.612
God!

39:00.901 --> 39:02.502
Allo, Guv'na!

39:03.818 --> 39:05.584
I'm so glad you like it.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.613
Yeah, I can't help it.
It's growing on me.

39:07.615 --> 39:09.548
Hey, I, I want to make a toast.

39:09.550 --> 39:11.717
But, Ollerman got away.

39:11.719 --> 39:14.653
I thought you only toasted
to successful missions.

39:14.655 --> 39:16.355
What's with Agent Buzzkill?

39:16.885 --> 39:18.463
Ray, we'll get him, okay?

39:18.488 --> 39:19.658
I promise.

39:19.660 --> 39:21.593
Besides, I wasn't...

39:21.595 --> 39:22.861
I wasn't gonna toast the mission.

39:22.863 --> 39:24.878
I wanted to raise a glass to this team.

39:24.903 --> 39:26.136
Ollerman really tested us.

39:26.161 --> 39:28.094
But nothing in this
world can break us apart.

39:28.119 --> 39:29.128
That's right.

39:29.153 --> 39:30.417
Cheers.

39:30.442 --> 39:31.774
Cheers.

39:33.190 --> 39:35.424
I'm your Secret Santa.

39:35.449 --> 39:37.588
I brought you this from Miami.

39:39.887 --> 39:41.554
Cuban rum.

39:41.682 --> 39:43.549
And the good kind.

39:43.551 --> 39:44.950
This was more than 30 bucks.

39:44.952 --> 39:46.186
Least I could do.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.920
I mean, after you called me

39:47.945 --> 39:49.412
to tell me how much you missed me...

39:50.590 --> 39:52.591
So you got the message.

39:53.356 --> 39:55.391
This must be goodbye rum.

39:55.730 --> 39:56.963
No.

39:57.465 --> 39:58.865
I thought it was sweet.

40:01.101 --> 40:05.838
Look, this is all new for me,
but I will figure it out.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.106
I promise.

40:12.826 --> 40:15.026
Do you need to know what
happened with the guy in Miami?

40:15.841 --> 40:17.049
I don't know.

40:17.051 --> 40:18.060
Do I?

40:18.686 --> 40:19.719
No.

40:20.221 --> 40:21.420
Okay.

40:21.422 --> 40:23.469
Miami. Never going there.

40:26.659 --> 40:28.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:28.308 --> 40:29.322
How you doing?

40:29.347 --> 40:30.813
Good. Better.

40:30.865 --> 40:33.220
I knew you guys would
come through for me, so...

40:34.345 --> 40:36.502
Well, I mean, there was
talk about leaving you there.

40:41.849 --> 40:43.317
You know what you have to do.

40:46.546 --> 40:48.414
You're right.

40:50.656 --> 40:51.817
Hey, Ray.

40:51.819 --> 40:53.552
I just wanted to say...

40:53.554 --> 40:55.154
you did an awesome job.

40:55.968 --> 40:58.001
Thanks, man. Means a lot.

40:58.987 --> 41:00.053
Good.

41:14.718 --> 41:15.895
Hey, man.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.587
I got you for Secret Santa.

41:17.645 --> 41:19.611
And although I would've
preferred to kill Todd,

41:19.613 --> 41:21.814
I'm happy you got to do it.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.048
Happy SHEP.

41:23.050 --> 41:24.450
Happy SHEP.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.387
You like it?

41:28.389 --> 41:29.730
Yes.

41:29.755 --> 41:30.793
I do.

41:30.818 --> 41:32.752
Would you prefer my Miami seduction rum?

41:34.394 --> 41:35.861
- Y-Yes. Can we?
- Yeah.

41:35.863 --> 41:37.529
Yeah? I actually
wanted the watch anyway.

41:37.531 --> 41:39.264
This is appropriate.

41:39.266 --> 41:40.999
Can we...

41:41.990 --> 41:43.357
Okay.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.271
Yeah, that's nice.

41:47.508 --> 41:48.890
- Thank you.
- Easy.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.015
We never finished our game.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.217
Ho, ho, ho.

41:58.219 --> 42:00.018
Secret Santa time.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.086
A necklace?

42:03.756 --> 42:06.325
That is the bullet
that you shot me with.

42:06.327 --> 42:08.360
It's... It's kind of a thing I do.

42:10.030 --> 42:11.196
I actually love it.

42:11.198 --> 42:12.397
Yeah, I knew you would.

42:14.468 --> 42:15.868
First of many.
