Now you take it from here, slugger.

02:13.604 --> 02:15.480
Joey?

02:19.360 --> 02:21.110
Joe Doyle!

02:25.032 --> 02:26.866
All right. What do you want?

02:26.992 --> 02:28.993
Hey, I got one of your birds.

02:29.161 --> 02:31.120
I recognized him by the band.

02:31.247 --> 02:35.124
Yeah, must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

02:35.251 --> 02:38.253
Yeah, he flew into my coop.
Do ya want him?

02:38.379 --> 02:41.506
Well, I gotta watch myself these days.
You know what I mean?

02:41.674 --> 02:45.176
Well, listen, don't worry.
I'll take him up to your loft.

02:45.344 --> 02:47.345
Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

03:00.401 --> 03:03.361
That a boy. That a boy.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.530
Come on, fella. Come on.

03:05.656 --> 03:08.283
That a boy.
Come on. Come on.

03:08.409 --> 03:10.368
- Hey.
- Hiya.

03:12.371 --> 03:14.205
How goes?

03:14.373 --> 03:15.790
He's up on the roof.

03:15.916 --> 03:17.917
The pigeon?

03:18.043 --> 03:19.586
Uh, yeah. It worked.

03:19.712 --> 03:23.047
[Screaming]

03:24.758 --> 03:26.718
I think somebody fell off the roof.

03:33.267 --> 03:36.227
He thought he was gonna sing
to the crime commission. He won't.

03:37.271 --> 03:39.856
- I thought they was gonna talk to him.
- That's the idea.

03:39.982 --> 03:42.358
I thought they was gonna talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

03:42.484 --> 03:44.485
Maybe he gave 'em an argument.

03:44.612 --> 03:48.031
No, I figured the worst they were
gonna do was lean on him a little bit.

03:48.157 --> 03:50.033
Like I said,
maybe he gave 'em an argument.

03:50.159 --> 03:52.744
He's been giving Johnny, the boss,
a lot of arguments lately.

03:52.912 --> 03:54.954
Wow.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.041
- He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.
- A canary.

03:58.167 --> 04:01.252

Same thing happened
to my Andy five years ago.

- You're Pop Doyle, the boy's father?
- That's right.

04:35.496 --> 04:37.956
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

04:38.082 --> 04:39.290
- Got any ideas?
- No.

04:39.458 --> 04:42.752
He was the only longshoreman that had
the guts to talk to them crime investigators.

04:42.878 --> 04:44.754
- Who asked you?
- Everybody knows that.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.465
Shut up. If Joey took my advice,
he wouldn't be...

04:47.633 --> 04:49.759
- Everybody knows that.
- I said shut up!

04:49.885 --> 04:51.761
Look, I know how you feel
about cops...

04:51.887 --> 04:54.138
but maybe if you could give me
some leads, I could...

04:54.306 --> 04:56.224
[Pop] I kept telling him,
"Don't say nothing.

04:56.350 --> 04:59.477
- Keep quiet. You'll live longer."
- [Latin]

04:59.645 --> 05:02.188

all my life, boy...

05:02.314 --> 05:04.399

05:04.525 --> 05:06.693
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

05:06.819 --> 05:08.820
unless you want
to wind up like that.

05:13.158 --> 05:16.077

Edie, time and faith. Remember,
time and faith are great healers.

05:32.386 --> 05:35.513
- Father, my brother's dead,
and you talk about time and faith!
- Shh. I know.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.766
- My brother was the best kid in the
neighborhood, and everybody said so.
- Shh. Edie, listen.

05:38.892 --> 05:40.852
I'm in the church if you need me.

05:42.187 --> 05:44.147
You're in the church if I need you?

05:44.273 --> 05:47.358
Did you ever hear
of a saint hiding in a church?

05:48.861 --> 05:51.821
I wanna know who killed my brother!

another drink on the cuff.

- All right.

- Charley, you count them.

Got a banana boat in 46 tomorrow.

06:20.142 --> 06:22.560
If we pull a walkout, might mean
a few bucks from the shippers.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.271
- Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
- Ask two Gs.

06:25.397 --> 06:27.607

with Kelly again, boss.

He won't take no loans,
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

- He's my wife's nephew.
- But he won't take no loans!

Hey, Skins, you handle
that sheet metal all right?

07:11.443 --> 07:14.112
Yeah, it was easy. The new checker
faked the receipt. Here it is.

When you talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

07:16.490 --> 07:18.950
- Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

07:19.118 --> 07:21.244
Here you are... 45 bills.

Hey, Terry, you count this.

- Go on. It's good for you.
It develops your mind.

- What mind?
- Shut up. I like the kid.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.841
Remember the night he took Farella
at St. Nick's, Charley, huh?

07:34.967 --> 07:38.386
We won a bundle.
Real tough. Big try.

07:38.512 --> 07:40.721
I lost the count.

07:42.558 --> 07:45.143
Okay. Forget it, Einstein.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.979
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley here?

07:48.105 --> 07:51.983
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to ten.

07:52.151 --> 07:55.111
You know, you're not
too funny today, fat man.

07:56.155 --> 07:57.655

What gives with our boy
tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.

08:00.993 --> 08:03.995
It's just the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

Just too much

- Listen, kid, I'm a soft touch too.

raised us ten kids...

I had to beg for work in the hold.

outta there for nothin'.

in the way. They give me this
to remember 'em by.

his hand over his throat...

08:38.030 --> 08:40.114

and he still went after them.

- I know it.
- I know what's eatin' you.

08:43.577 --> 08:46.704
Well, I got 2,000
dues-payin' members in this local.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.541
That's $72,000 a year legitimate.

a couple of bucks a day...

08:53.045 --> 08:55.004

Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.

boxed out of a deal like this, do you...

of one lousy little cheese-eater...

squealin' to the crime commission, do ya?

and I'm not sayin' nothin'.

14:35.136 --> 14:37.054
So why don't you
and your girlfriend just take off?

14:37.222 --> 14:39.473
All right, Mr. Malloy.
You have every right not to talk...

14:39.599 --> 14:41.392
if that's what you choose to do.

14:41.518 --> 14:44.103
- The public has a right
to know the facts too.
- Yeah. All right.

14:44.229 --> 14:48.190
- We'll be seeing you again.
- Never is gonna be
too much soon for me, shorty.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.402
Take it easy.

14:53.071 --> 14:55.864
How do you like them mugs,
takin' me for a pigeon?

14:55.991 --> 14:58.325
- Who was it?
- I don't know who they are.

14:58.451 --> 15:02.246
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

15:02.414 --> 15:05.958
Some chance at ten percent a week.
And if we don't borrow, we don't work.

15:06.084 --> 15:08.335
May you rot in hell, J.P.

15:08.461 --> 15:11.380
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

15:11.506 --> 15:14.466
Why don't you drop dead now
so we can test your theory?

15:14.593 --> 15:16.635
Condolences.

15:16.761 --> 15:19.096
Hey, Pop, look.

15:24.436 --> 15:26.729
All right. Let her go, Tony.

15:26.855 --> 15:28.981
[Whistle Blows]

15:39.784 --> 15:42.661
[Big Mac Addressing Crowd,
Indistinct]

15:42.787 --> 15:45.456
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

15:48.001 --> 15:51.920
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar.

15:53.214 --> 15:55.299
Don't you? Huh?

15:58.136 --> 16:00.804
I see the sisters
taught you not to lie.

16:00.972 --> 16:02.556
[Whistle Blowing]

16:02.682 --> 16:06.602
All right. Loften, Malloy...

16:06.728 --> 16:10.147
Hendricks, Prochowski...

16:10.315 --> 16:12.316
- Westerfield, McGryer.
- Three forty-one.

16:12.484 --> 16:15.778
- Three forty-eight.
- Seventy-one.

16:15.904 --> 16:18.530
I've been thinking
about your question, and, uh...

16:18.657 --> 16:20.658
you're right, Edie.

16:21.701 --> 16:24.036
This is my parish.

16:24.162 --> 16:26.580
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

16:26.706 --> 16:30.125
unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

16:30.251 --> 16:33.128
All right, I need
some extra banana carriers.

16:33.254 --> 16:37.508
Bananas again. I wonder when
we're gonna get a boat from Ireland
with some good Irish whiskey on it.

16:37.676 --> 16:40.719
Dugan, my boy,
you're dreamin' again.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.763
All right. Kelly.

16:44.391 --> 16:46.725
Richie.

16:55.568 --> 16:57.236
Yeah, you.

16:58.863 --> 17:02.032
What's the matter?
Nobody wanna work today?

17:04.327 --> 17:11.416
Yeah, you.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.878

a day's pay around here?

[All Shouting]

17:31.187 --> 17:33.230
- Meatballs.
- Definitely.

17:39.446 --> 17:41.572
Come here!

17:41.740 --> 17:44.450
Hey, Terry! Grab that one!

17:48.580 --> 17:50.998
- Give me that!
- [Shouting]

17:52.167 --> 17:55.002
- Give it to me!
- What? What?

17:55.128 --> 17:57.045
- Give it to me!
- Huh?

17:57.172 --> 17:59.757
- Give me that!
- What makes you so special?

17:59.924 --> 18:01.759
Oh-ho! Things are
lookin' up on the docks.

18:01.926 --> 18:03.927
Don't you recognize her, dopey?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

18:04.053 --> 18:06.138
You give me that!

18:08.475 --> 18:10.434
You Joey Doyle's sister?

18:10.602 --> 18:12.394
Yes, I am.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.104
Yeah.

18:14.230 --> 18:16.315
You don't wanna go
to work today anyhow.

18:17.734 --> 18:19.818
Well, it's been nice
wrestlin' with ya.

18:24.157 --> 18:26.074
Edie.

18:26.201 --> 18:28.869
Pop?
Here's your tab. Take it.

18:31.289 --> 18:32.998
All right. Give it to me.
I can use it.

18:33.124 --> 18:35.959
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

18:36.127 --> 18:39.129
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so...

18:39.297 --> 18:43.175
lettin' her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

18:43.301 --> 18:46.136
[Big Mac] All right, that's all.
Come back tomorrow.

18:51.476 --> 18:53.644
Hey, what do you do now?

18:53.812 --> 18:55.813
Like Big Mac said,
come back tomorrow.

18:55.939 --> 18:57.940
Tomorrow?
No ship tomorrow.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.150
I've been standin' here
for five straight mornings...

19:00.318 --> 19:02.486
and that bum over there
looks right through you.

19:02.654 --> 19:05.823
You can't be around here.
Come on. Get outta here.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.283
I'm sorry, Father.
I didn't mean it.

19:09.494 --> 19:11.995
- What do you wanna do?
- Come on. Let's go get a bowl.

19:12.121 --> 19:15.165
Wait a minute. Is this all you do...
just take it like this?

19:16.751 --> 19:19.044
Huh? What about your union?

19:23.216 --> 19:26.218
No other union in the country
would stand for a thing like that.

19:26.344 --> 19:30.013
The waterfront's tougher, Father.
Like it ain't part of America.

19:30.139 --> 19:33.600
- You know how a trigger local works,
Father?
- No. How?

19:33.726 --> 19:36.186
You get up in a meetin',
you make a motion...

19:36.312 --> 19:38.397
the lights go out,
then you go out.

19:38.523 --> 19:42.025
That's how it's been ever since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

19:42.193 --> 19:44.611
Name one place where it's safe
to even talk without gettin' clobbered.

19:44.737 --> 19:45.988
The church.

19:46.114 --> 19:47.948
What?

19:49.868 --> 19:51.743
The bottom of the church.

19:51.870 --> 19:53.912
[Dugan] You know what
you're lettin' yourself in for?

19:56.249 --> 19:59.585
- You got a cigarette on you?
- Yeah.

20:10.221 --> 20:12.055

- You working hard?
- Yeah.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.984
You wouldn't mind
working once in a while...

20:24.110 --> 20:26.653
just to justify this lofty position,
would you?

20:28.072 --> 20:30.365
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

20:30.491 --> 20:34.786
We have an extra detail for you...
that's if you don't mind...

20:34.913 --> 20:37.247
being disturbed or anything.

20:37.415 --> 20:41.293
The priest and this Doyle girl are gettin'
a meeting together down at the church...

20:41.419 --> 20:43.587
and we, uh...
we want a rundown on it...

20:43.755 --> 20:45.881
you know, the names
and the numbers of all the players.

20:46.007 --> 20:48.759
Wait a minute.
All right. You're nominated.

20:48.927 --> 20:52.512
Well, why me, Charley?
I feel funny goin' down there.

20:52.639 --> 20:55.766
- Besides, I'd just be stoolin' for you.
- Let me tell you what stooling is.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.560
Stooling is when you rat on your friends,
the guys you're with.

20:58.686 --> 21:00.437
- Yeah.
- But if Johnny wants a favor...

21:00.605 --> 21:03.607
don't think about it... do it.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.777
Now, go on.
Join the congregation.

21:23.503 --> 21:26.380
Well, I thought there'd be
more of you here, but...

21:28.091 --> 21:31.093
The... The Romans found out
what a handful could do...

21:31.219 --> 21:33.929
if it's the right handful.

21:34.055 --> 21:36.682
Um...

21:36.808 --> 21:40.644
I'm just a potato-eater, but, um,
isn't it simple as one, two, three?

21:40.812 --> 21:43.146
One:
The working conditions are bad.

21:43.272 --> 21:45.190
Two: They're bad because
the mob does the hiring.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.442
And three: The only way
we can break the mob...

21:47.568 --> 21:49.695
is to stop letting them
get away with murder.

21:49.821 --> 21:51.822
Now, if one of you would just
answer one question...

21:51.948 --> 21:53.949
we'd have a start,
a very good start.

21:54.075 --> 21:55.951
And that question is...

21:56.077 --> 21:58.662
who killed Joey Doyle?

22:06.045 --> 22:09.047
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

22:12.844 --> 22:16.179
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

22:17.974 --> 22:20.267
All right, then answer this one:

22:20.393 --> 22:22.477
How can we
call ourselves Christians...

22:22.603 --> 22:24.813
and protect these murderers
with our silence?

22:30.903 --> 22:33.321
Jimmy Collins,
you were Joey's best friend.

22:33.448 --> 22:36.158
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

22:36.284 --> 22:38.869
And I'll always think of him
as my best friend.

22:38.995 --> 22:41.663
- But what do you want me to...
- Who asked him in here?

22:42.707 --> 22:45.542
I'm just trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.211
- Maybe you can be helpful.
- "Helpful"?

22:48.337 --> 22:52.215
The brother of Charley the Gent?
They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.

22:52.341 --> 22:54.217
Better leave Charley outta this.

22:54.343 --> 22:56.136
You don't think he'd be "helpful"?

22:56.262 --> 22:58.305
Why don't you ask him yourself?

22:58.431 --> 23:00.432
Maybe I will one of these days.

23:01.934 --> 23:03.769
"One of these days."

23:03.895 --> 23:06.980
Now, listen.
You know who the pistols are.

23:08.066 --> 23:11.401
You going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

23:12.820 --> 23:14.571
Are you?

23:15.656 --> 23:17.491
Hey, Dugan, how about you?

23:17.617 --> 23:21.745
One thing you gotta understand, Father:
On the dock we've always been D and D.

23:21.871 --> 23:24.122
- "D and D"...what's that?
- Deaf and dumb.

23:24.248 --> 23:27.084
No matter how much we hate
the torpedoes, we don't rat.

23:27.210 --> 23:30.879
"Rat"?
Now, boys, get smart.

23:31.005 --> 23:33.423
I know you're gettin'
pushed around, but...

23:33.549 --> 23:36.551
there's one thing we've got in this country,
and that's ways of fightin' back.

23:36.677 --> 23:39.888
Now, getting the facts to the public,
testifying for what you know is right...

23:40.014 --> 23:41.640
against what you know is wrong.

23:41.766 --> 23:44.059
And what's ratting to them
is telling the truth for you.

23:44.185 --> 23:45.936
Can't you see that?

23:47.772 --> 23:50.565
Can't you see that? Huh?

24:06.541 --> 24:10.293
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

24:10.461 --> 24:12.420
I think you'll agree
with that, Father.

24:12.547 --> 24:16.633
So I'd like to close
with a few words from St. Matthew.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.927
"Come unto me, all ye..."

24:27.436 --> 24:30.313
What did I tell you, sticking your neck out?
This is a police problem, not ours!

24:30.481 --> 24:33.024
- These people need our help, Vince.
- Okay! Okay!

24:33.151 --> 24:35.152
Only don't blame me
when they ship you off to Abyssinia.

They won't hurt him.

25:31.918 --> 25:33.835
Get out, you!

25:39.050 --> 25:41.384
Here, talk to me.
Are you all right, Dugan?

25:41.552 --> 25:44.221
Yeah, considerin' they were
usin' my head for a baseball.

25:44.347 --> 25:46.514
Are you still D and D?
You still call it ratting?

25:46.641 --> 25:48.558
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?

25:48.726 --> 25:51.937
If I stick my neck out and they chop it off,
would that be the end of it...

25:52.063 --> 25:54.189
- or are you willing to go all the way?
- Down the line.

or no turned-around collar.

and I'll stand up with you.

- So help me God.

pretty rough around here.

now all right.

26:35.273 --> 26:37.190
You're Edie Doyle.

- Your brother was a saint.

to get me compensation.

- You remember.

Get outta here!

Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.209
You don't buy me.

26:56.335 --> 26:58.420
You're still a bum.

26:58.546 --> 27:00.630
So long, Edie.

27:00.798 --> 27:02.716
Lord have mercy on Joey.

27:04.051 --> 27:05.969
Who's callin' me a bum?

27:09.015 --> 27:11.433
Everybody loved Joey.

27:11.559 --> 27:13.935
From little kids to the old rummies.

27:16.355 --> 27:18.315
Did you know him very well?

27:19.775 --> 27:22.152
Well, you know, he got around.

27:23.654 --> 27:26.489
- What did that man mean just now?
- Don't pay no attention to him.

27:26.615 --> 27:28.867
He's drunk, he's falling down,
everything.

27:28.993 --> 27:31.786
He's just a juicehead
that hangs around the neighborhood.

27:31.912 --> 27:34.039
Don't pay no attention.

27:34.165 --> 27:36.041
I'd better go now.

27:36.167 --> 27:38.835
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna bite ya.

27:40.338 --> 27:43.757
I guess they don't let you walk with fellas
where you've been, huh?

27:43.883 --> 27:45.842
You know how the sisters are.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.553
Yeah.
Are you training to be a nun?

27:48.679 --> 27:50.722
It's just a regular college.

27:50.848 --> 27:52.682
Wait a second.

27:52.808 --> 27:55.727
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

27:55.853 --> 27:57.896
Where is that?

27:58.022 --> 27:59.856
It's in Tarrytown.

27:59.982 --> 28:03.568
- Where is that?
- In the country.

28:03.694 --> 28:06.404
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

28:09.367 --> 28:11.951
So how often do you get in here?

28:12.078 --> 28:15.705
I guess I haven't been here
since last Christmas.

28:16.749 --> 28:19.125
We were gonna have
a Thanksgiving party.

28:20.795 --> 28:23.004
That's nice.

28:23.130 --> 28:26.841
What do you do up there?
Just... What? Study?

28:26.967 --> 28:28.885
I want to be a teacher.

28:29.053 --> 28:31.971
A teacher?
That's very good. You know...

28:32.098 --> 28:35.725
Personally, I admire brains.
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.

28:35.893 --> 28:38.561
He done a couple of years
of college.

28:38.687 --> 28:43.108
It isn't just brains.
It's... It's how you use them.

28:43.234 --> 28:45.485
Yeah, I get your thought.

28:45.611 --> 28:47.987
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

28:48.114 --> 28:51.324
Remember parochial school
on Pulaski Street?

28:51.450 --> 28:54.411
Seven, eight years ago?
Your hair... Had your hair, uh...

28:54.578 --> 28:56.413
Braids. That's right.

28:56.580 --> 28:58.498
Looked like a hunk of rope.

28:58.624 --> 29:01.209
You had wires on your teeth, and...

29:01.335 --> 29:03.211
glasses, everything.

29:03.337 --> 29:05.922
You was really a mess.

29:06.090 --> 29:09.175
I can get home
all right now, thanks.

29:09.301 --> 29:11.719
Hey, listen, don't get sore.
I'm just kiddin' you a little bit.

29:11.846 --> 29:14.556
I just mean to tell you that you...

29:14.682 --> 29:17.016
grew up very nice.

29:17.143 --> 29:19.102
Thanks.

29:19.270 --> 29:22.272
You don't...
You don't remember me, do you?

29:24.191 --> 29:26.401
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

29:26.527 --> 29:29.279
By the nose, huh?

29:31.574 --> 29:35.952
Well, some people just got faces
that stick in your mind.

29:38.205 --> 29:40.415
I remember you were
in trouble all the time.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.625
Now you got me.

29:42.793 --> 29:46.629
Boy, the way those sisters used
to whack me, I don't know what.

29:47.673 --> 29:51.301
They thought they was gonna beat
an education into me, but I foxed 'em.

29:53.888 --> 29:56.723
Maybe they just didn't know
how to handle you.

29:56.849 --> 29:58.558
How would you have done it?

30:00.478 --> 30:03.855
With a little more patience
and kindness.

30:05.024 --> 30:08.401
That's what makes people
mean and difficult:
People don't care enough about them.

30:13.574 --> 30:16.659
What, are you kiddin' me?

30:16.827 --> 30:18.578
Come on.
I'd better get you home.

30:18.704 --> 30:22.248
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

30:23.334 --> 30:25.168
Am I gonna see you again?

30:28.339 --> 30:29.964
What for?

30:33.344 --> 30:35.303
I don't know.

30:39.350 --> 30:42.018
- I really don't know.
- Ah, come on.

30:46.815 --> 30:48.733
Come on.

31:05.209 --> 31:07.043
All right.
You're all packed.

31:07.211 --> 31:10.880
Here's your bus ticket, and you're
on your way back to St. Anne's.

31:11.048 --> 31:14.968
- I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.
- Edie, for years your mom and me...

31:15.094 --> 31:17.720
put quarters into the cookie jar...

31:17.846 --> 31:19.931
to keep you up there
with the sisters...

31:20.057 --> 31:23.142
keep you from things
like I just seen outside the window.

31:24.228 --> 31:26.813
A daughter of mine walkin'
arm in arm with Terry Malloy.

31:26.939 --> 31:29.816
- You know who Terry Malloy is?
- Who is he, Pop?

31:29.942 --> 31:32.735
- He's the kid brother
of Charley the Gent...
- [Cat Meows]

31:32.861 --> 31:37.240
Who is Johnny Friendly's right hand,
and a butcher in a camel-hair coat.

31:38.742 --> 31:41.077
You tryin' to tell me Terry is too?

31:41.245 --> 31:43.246
He tries to act tough...

31:45.583 --> 31:47.542
but there's a look in his eye.

31:47.668 --> 31:49.669
Yeah, a look in his eye.
[Mock Chuckle]

31:49.795 --> 31:52.797
Hold your hats, brothers.
Here we go again.

31:52.923 --> 31:55.091
Do you think he's one
of them cases you're always...

31:55.259 --> 31:57.468
draggin' into the house
and feelin' sorry for...

31:57.595 --> 32:00.430
like that litter of kittens
you brought in?

32:00.598 --> 32:03.600
[Scoffs]
The only one you wanted to keep...

32:03.726 --> 32:06.477
had six toes
and was cockeyed to boot.

32:06.604 --> 32:09.522
Look at him, the little bum.

32:09.648 --> 32:11.608
He said he wants to see me again.

32:15.112 --> 32:16.779
Look.

32:18.574 --> 32:20.491
See this arm?

32:22.620 --> 32:25.330
Two inches longer than the other.

32:25.456 --> 32:27.540
That's from years of workin'...

32:27.666 --> 32:30.126
and sweatin' and liftin'...

32:30.294 --> 32:32.629
and swingin' a hook.

32:34.048 --> 32:37.717
Every time I hoist a box
or a coffee bag...

32:37.843 --> 32:40.178
I says to meself, "That's for Edie...

32:40.304 --> 32:42.764
so she can be a teacher
or somethin' decent."

32:42.890 --> 32:45.141
Oh, Pop!

32:45.309 --> 32:47.352
I promised your mom, Edie.

32:47.478 --> 32:49.562
Don't let her down.

32:49.688 --> 32:51.564
Pop...

32:51.690 --> 32:55.652
I don't want you to think that I'm not
grateful for everything you've done...

32:55.778 --> 32:59.947
for giving me the education,
for keeping me away from all of this.

33:00.074 --> 33:02.700
But Pop, I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

33:02.826 --> 33:06.996
How can I got back to school and keep
my mind on things that are just in books?

33:07.164 --> 33:09.374
That-That aren't people living?

33:10.542 --> 33:12.293
I'm gonna stay, Pop...

33:12.419 --> 33:16.297
and I'm gonna keep on trying
to find out who is guilty for Joey.

33:47.204 --> 33:49.205
[Boy]
Heads up!

34:05.222 --> 34:06.514
Hi.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.725
What are you doin' up here
on the roof?

34:11.270 --> 34:12.853
Just looking.

34:14.022 --> 34:16.565
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighborhood.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.862
Fly pretty nice, huh?

34:22.030 --> 34:24.614
"Golden Warriors"?

34:24.742 --> 34:28.077
Yeah. I started
the Golden Warriors.

34:29.121 --> 34:32.748
You might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

34:32.916 --> 34:35.877
Hey. This bum here
is my shadow.

34:36.003 --> 34:38.838
He thinks I'm a tough man
'cause I boxed pro for a while.

34:40.047 --> 34:42.592
Think you're a tough guy, huh?

34:42.717 --> 34:46.721
- Joey used to raise pigeons.
- Get outta here.

34:46.847 --> 34:50.224
- Huh?
- Joey used to raise pigeons.

34:51.810 --> 34:53.770
Yeah, he had a few birds.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.233
I've been takin' care of 'em.

34:59.359 --> 35:02.904
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

35:04.656 --> 35:06.449
I just go for it.

35:10.078 --> 35:13.748
You know this city is full of hawks?
That's a fact.

35:13.874 --> 35:16.834
They hang around
on top of the big hotels...

35:16.960 --> 35:20.171
and they spot
a pigeon in the park...

35:20.297 --> 35:22.799
Right down on 'em.

35:23.884 --> 35:26.469
You got a second?
One second?

35:29.389 --> 35:31.307
I wanna show you something.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.819
Here you are.
What do you think of that fella?

35:42.945 --> 35:44.654
She's a beauty.

35:44.780 --> 35:47.448
She's a he.
His name is Swifty.

35:47.574 --> 35:50.493
Oh! Oh, look what
he went and did.

35:54.331 --> 35:56.040
He's my lead bird.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.751
He's always on top of the perch.

35:58.877 --> 36:02.839
If another bum tries to come along and
take his place, he really lets him have it.

36:05.384 --> 36:07.343
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

36:08.428 --> 36:11.889
Well, one thing about 'em, though:
They're very faithful.

36:13.517 --> 36:17.144
- They get married just like people.
- Better.

36:17.271 --> 36:19.355
And they stay that way
till one of 'em dies.

36:21.066 --> 36:22.692
That's nice.

36:28.657 --> 36:30.366
Hey, go ahead. Fix the roof.

36:34.580 --> 36:37.206
Here. You want that egg?

36:40.043 --> 36:41.752
Thanks.

36:45.632 --> 36:47.300
Do you like beer?

36:49.720 --> 36:51.679
I don't know.

36:53.181 --> 36:55.641
I'll bet you never had
a glass of beer.

36:55.767 --> 36:59.061
- You ever have a glass of beer?
- No.

36:59.187 --> 37:00.813
Shh.

37:02.608 --> 37:04.567
Wanna have one with me?

37:06.236 --> 37:07.862
In a saloon?

37:07.988 --> 37:09.739
Well, yeah.

37:09.865 --> 37:12.199
I mean, I know a nice little dump
down there that...

37:12.326 --> 37:15.578
got a special entrance for ladies,
and all like that.

37:18.790 --> 37:20.750
Come on. It won't hurt.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.922
Come on.

37:30.302 --> 37:31.928
Yeah? Good.

37:36.725 --> 37:39.560
- Hey, Mac?
- Yeah.

37:39.686 --> 37:42.271
Two Glockenheimers
and two for chasers.

37:42.397 --> 37:45.608
Yeah. See the fight last night?

37:45.734 --> 37:48.819
- No.
- Kid named Riley. Both hands.

37:48.946 --> 37:50.905
Like you used to do.

37:51.031 --> 37:54.116
Ha-ha.
I hope he got better dice than me.

37:55.202 --> 37:56.786
Comedian.

37:57.996 --> 38:00.247
Are you really a prizefighter?

38:01.833 --> 38:03.417
I used to be.

38:04.711 --> 38:07.338
How did you get interested in that?

38:07.464 --> 38:10.633
Well, I don't know.
I had to scrap all my life.

38:10.759 --> 38:13.302
I might as well get paid for it.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.638
When I was a kid,
my old man got bumped off, and...

38:15.764 --> 38:18.808
and, uh... never mind how.

38:18.934 --> 38:21.560
And they stuck
Charley and me in a...

38:21.687 --> 38:24.438
a dump they call a children's home.

38:26.316 --> 38:28.859
Oh, boy, that was some home.

38:28.986 --> 38:32.113
Well, anyhow,
I ran away from there...

38:32.239 --> 38:34.240
and I fought in the club smokers
and peddled papers...

38:34.366 --> 38:36.242
and Johnny Friendly bought
a piece of me.

38:36.368 --> 38:38.327
Bought a piece of you?

38:38.453 --> 38:40.538
Yes.

38:40.664 --> 38:44.291
Then, uh, I was goin'
pretty good there for a while.

38:45.335 --> 38:47.294
And after that, uh...

38:49.172 --> 38:51.048
Well, I don't know.

38:51.174 --> 38:53.259
What do you really care?
Am I right?

38:56.304 --> 38:59.515
Shouldn't everybody care
about everybody else?

39:02.060 --> 39:04.311
Oh, what a fruitcake you are.

39:04.438 --> 39:08.482
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

39:08.608 --> 39:10.776
And you really believe that drool?

39:10.902 --> 39:12.695
Yes, I do.

39:14.948 --> 39:18.284
Well, here we are.
One for the lady and for the gent.

39:19.911 --> 39:22.496
Here's to the first one.
I hope it ain't the last.

39:22.622 --> 39:24.999
- Tink.
- [Edie Chuckles]

39:25.125 --> 39:26.709
Go ahead.

39:31.048 --> 39:32.673
- Mmm.
- Good?

39:32.799 --> 39:35.051
No, not like that. One hump.

39:37.804 --> 39:44.852
Wham.

39:46.271 --> 39:49.356
Hey, you wanna hear
my philosophy of life?

39:50.817 --> 39:54.528
[Imitates Knife Plunging]
Do it to him before he does it to you.

39:55.906 --> 39:58.157
I never met anyone like you.

39:59.743 --> 40:01.911
There's not a... a spark...

40:02.079 --> 40:04.580
of sentiment or romance...

40:04.748 --> 40:06.749
or human kindness
in your whole body.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.293
What good does it do you
besides get you in trouble?

40:09.419 --> 40:12.171
And when things and people
get in your way...

40:12.297 --> 40:15.091
you just knock them aside,
get rid of them... is that your idea?

40:15.217 --> 40:17.093
Listen, don't look at me
when you say that.

40:17.219 --> 40:20.513
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.
Fixin' him wasn't my idea.

40:22.641 --> 40:24.433
Who said it was?

40:24.559 --> 40:27.645
Well, everybody's puttin'
the needle on me...

40:27.771 --> 40:30.439
you and them mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.441
I didn't like the way
he was lookin' at me.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.944
He was looking
at everybody the same way.

40:35.070 --> 40:37.154
Oh, yeah?

40:37.280 --> 40:41.158
Anyhow, what's with this Father Barry?
What's his racket?

40:41.284 --> 40:44.954
- His racket?
- Yeah, his racket.
Everybody's got a racket.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.705
But he's a priest.

40:46.832 --> 40:49.208
Are you kiddin'? So what?
That don't make no difference.

40:49.334 --> 40:51.961
You don't believe anybody, do you?

40:52.129 --> 40:54.672
Listen, down here
it's every man for himself.

40:54.798 --> 40:56.674
It's keepin' alive.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.344
It's standin' in with the right people
so you get a little bit of change
jinglin' in your pocket.

41:00.470 --> 41:02.596
- And if you don't?
- If you don't...

41:02.722 --> 41:05.224
right down.

41:05.350 --> 41:07.434
It's living like an animal.

41:07.561 --> 41:10.938
All right, then. I'd rather live
like an animal than end up like...

41:11.064 --> 41:13.190
Like Joey?

41:13.316 --> 41:15.442
Are you afraid to mention his name?

41:15.569 --> 41:17.695
No.

41:17.821 --> 41:20.656
Well, what do you keep
harpin' on that for?

41:22.033 --> 41:25.452
Come on, drink up.
You gotta get a little fun outta life.

41:25.579 --> 41:28.122
Come on.
I'll stick some music on.

41:34.337 --> 41:36.297
What's the matter?

41:43.889 --> 41:47.183
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?

41:50.020 --> 41:53.189
Help me if you can, for God sakes.

41:56.693 --> 41:59.361
Edie, I'd like to help.

41:59.487 --> 42:02.198
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

42:04.367 --> 42:06.035
All right.

42:08.538 --> 42:10.706
I shouldn't have asked you.

42:12.584 --> 42:15.252
Here, come on. Have a little beer.

42:15.378 --> 42:17.338
Come on, come on.

42:18.965 --> 42:20.883
I don't want it.

42:24.346 --> 42:26.388
You just stay here
and finish your drink.

- I know that.
- All right. You think
Johnny's gonna jeopardize...

01:12:27.355 --> 01:12:30.774
- the whole setup for one rubber-lipped
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels?
- Don't say that.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.651
- What the...
- I coulda been better.

01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:34.862
- That's not the point.
- I coulda been a lot better.

01:12:34.988 --> 01:12:37.156
The point is
we don't have much time.

01:12:37.282 --> 01:12:39.366
I'm tellin' you,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

01:12:39.534 --> 01:12:43.537
Well, make up your mind
before we get to 437 River Street!

01:12:50.795 --> 01:12:52.921
Before we get to where, Charley?

01:12:57.552 --> 01:12:59.511
- Before we get to where?
- Listen to me.

01:12:59.637 --> 01:13:03.223
Take the job. Just take it.
No questions. Take it.

01:13:03.349 --> 01:13:04.892
Charley.

01:13:05.018 --> 01:13:06.894
Terry, take this job, please.

01:13:07.062 --> 01:13:08.645
Charley.

01:13:08.772 --> 01:13:11.023
Please take it.

01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:12.858
Charley.

01:13:21.076 --> 01:13:22.910
Oh, Charley.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.375
Wow.

01:13:34.297 --> 01:13:39.885
Look, kid, I...

01:13:43.807 --> 01:13:45.766
How much you weigh, slugger?

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:50.813
When you weighed 168 pounds...

01:13:51.898 --> 01:13:53.774
you were beautiful.

01:13:54.859 --> 01:13:57.569
You coulda been another Billy Conn.

01:14:00.448 --> 01:14:02.741
And that skunk we got you
for a manager...

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:06.036
he brought you along too fast.

01:14:07.997 --> 01:14:10.541
It wasn't him, Charley.
It was you.

01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:13.877
You remember that night in the Garden
you came down to my dressin' room...

01:14:14.003 --> 01:14:16.338
and said,
"Kid, this ain't your night.

01:14:16.464 --> 01:14:19.341
We're goin' for the price
on Wilson"?

01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:21.969
You remember that?

01:14:22.095 --> 01:14:24.471
"This ain't your night."

01:14:24.639 --> 01:14:27.891
My night!
I coulda taken Wilson apart.

01:14:29.519 --> 01:14:32.646
So what happens? He gets
the title shot outdoors in a ballpark...

01:14:32.772 --> 01:14:35.649
and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville.

01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:40.445
You was my brother, Charley.
You shoulda looked out for me a little bit.

01:14:40.572 --> 01:14:42.531
You shoulda taken care of me
just a little bit...

01:14:42.657 --> 01:14:44.658
so I wouldn't have to take dives
for the short-end money.

01:14:44.784 --> 01:14:47.202
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

01:14:47.328 --> 01:14:50.706
You don't understand.
I coulda had class.

01:14:50.832 --> 01:14:53.041
I coulda been a contender.

01:14:53.168 --> 01:14:56.003
I coulda been somebody...

01:14:56.171 --> 01:14:58.172
instead of a bum...

01:14:58.298 --> 01:15:00.591
which is what I am, let's face it.

01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:07.598
It was you, Charley.

01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:18.525
Okay.

01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:22.196
I'll tell him...

01:15:22.322 --> 01:15:24.448
I couldn't find you.

01:15:24.574 --> 01:15:26.533
Ten to one he won't believe it.

01:15:30.705 --> 01:15:32.164
Here.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.042
You take this.

01:15:36.211 --> 01:15:38.045
You're gonna need it.

01:15:39.672 --> 01:15:41.381
You, you pull over.

01:15:50.642 --> 01:15:52.976
Take me to the Garden.

01:15:59.567 --> 01:16:01.652

I want you
to stay away from me!

01:16:52.245 --> 01:16:55.372
I know what you want me to do,
but I ain't gonna do it, so forget it!

01:16:55.498 --> 01:16:57.624
I don't want you to do anything.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.835
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

01:16:59.961 --> 01:17:02.963
Shut up about that conscience.
That's all I been hearin'!

01:17:03.089 --> 01:17:06.341
- I never mentioned the word before.
You just stay away from me!
- Edie!

01:17:06.467 --> 01:17:08.260
Edie, you love me.

01:17:09.637 --> 01:17:13.015
- I want you...
- I didn't say I didn't love you.
I said stay away from me!

01:17:13.141 --> 01:17:16.059
- I want you to say it to me.
- Stay away from me!

Let's get out of here, please.

First Joey, and then Dugan,
and now Charley, and then...

Please, Terry, someplace
where we can live in peace.

Please, Terry.

Go get the Father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

He's not here now.

Oh, yeah?

01:23:00.863 --> 01:23:03.615

- Take it easy, Terry.
- Don't give me no advice.

- You go to hell.

- What did you say?
- Go to hell.

- Sorry. Let me help you up there.
- Get your hands off of me!

01:24:55.519 --> 01:24:58.396
- Now what am I gonna do?
- You want to be brave?

01:24:58.522 --> 01:25:01.858
Firing lead into another man
isn't being brave!

01:25:01.984 --> 01:25:03.693
Why don't you mind
your own business?

01:25:03.819 --> 01:25:07.322
- Firing lead into another man's flesh
isn't being brave!
- It's none of your business!

01:25:07.448 --> 01:25:09.908
You want to hurt
Johnny Friendly?

01:25:10.034 --> 01:25:12.911
Huh? You want to hurt him?
You want to fix him?

01:25:13.037 --> 01:25:15.455
Do you?
Do you really want to finish him?

01:25:15.623 --> 01:25:19.209
- What do you think?
- For what he did to Charley and a dozen
other men better than Charley?

01:25:19.335 --> 01:25:21.544
Then don't fight him like a hoodlum
down here in the jungle...

01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:23.671
because that's just what he wants!

01:25:23.798 --> 01:25:26.508
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defense.

01:25:26.634 --> 01:25:29.803
You'll fight him in the courtroom
tomorrow with the truth...

01:25:29.929 --> 01:25:31.846
as you know the truth.

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:42.982
Now, you get rid of that gun,
unless you haven't got the guts.

01:25:43.108 --> 01:25:46.277
And if you haven't,
then you better hold on to it.

01:25:50.491 --> 01:25:52.242
Gimme a beer.

01:26:01.293 --> 01:26:04.045
Want a beer? Make it two.

01:26:43.711 --> 01:26:46.880
[Man] You mean to sit there
and tell me that your local takes in...

01:26:47.006 --> 01:26:50.884
$65,500 every year...

01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:53.052

01:26:53.178 --> 01:26:55.680
- [Big Mac] Oh, sure. We got records.
- Well, where are they?

01:26:55.806 --> 01:26:59.642
Well, you see, we was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.

01:26:59.768 --> 01:27:01.644

You know you're under oath.

01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:04.063
- Oh, sure.

01:27:11.739 --> 01:27:14.574
Doesn't it seem odd to you
that five different waterfront locals...

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.743
were broken into last night...

01:27:16.869 --> 01:27:19.787
and the only item missing from all
of them was the financial records?

01:27:19.914 --> 01:27:22.874
What do you mean, "odd"?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

are all the officers of Local 374

- Next witness.
- Mr. Malloy.

- Name, please.
- Terry Malloy.

and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:28:37.908 --> 01:28:39.325
- Right.
- "I do."

01:28:39.493 --> 01:28:41.494
- I do.
- Be seated, please.

01:28:42.997 --> 01:28:47.291
Mr. Malloy, is it true that the night
Joey Doyle was found dead...

01:28:47.418 --> 01:28:51.462
you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

01:28:51.588 --> 01:28:54.424
- Yes, that's right.
- And is it true
that you went immediately...

01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:56.634
Wait. Except for
the guys that pushed him off.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.887
[Man] And is it true that you went
immediately to the Friendly bar...

01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:03.224
and there expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:05.101
John Friendly. Right.

01:29:05.227 --> 01:29:07.520
And now, Mr. Malloy,
can you tell me...

01:29:07.688 --> 01:29:10.690
whether Mr. Friendly...
or I should say Mr. Skelly...

01:29:10.816 --> 01:29:12.817
said anything to you
to indicate his responsibility...

01:29:12.943 --> 01:29:14.861
in getting rid of Joey Doyle?

01:29:15.029 --> 01:29:17.321
- [Terry] Right.
- And would you say, Mr. Malloy...

01:29:17.448 --> 01:29:19.532
that Mr. Friendly made it
very clear to you...

01:29:19.658 --> 01:29:22.118
that it was absolutely necessary
that he murder Joey Doyle...

01:29:22.244 --> 01:29:24.454
- in order to maintain his control...
- Turn that thing off.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.664
Of the docks and the waterfront locals?
Is that correct?

01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:29.834
Would there be anything else, sir?

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.920
Yes, Sidney.
If Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.

01:29:33.047 --> 01:29:35.840
- Anytime today?
- If he calls ever, I'm out!

01:29:35.966 --> 01:29:37.675
Very well, sir.

01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:39.343
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:42.638
You've done more
than break the Joey Doyle case.

01:29:45.309 --> 01:29:48.269
You've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

01:29:48.395 --> 01:29:50.396
with job security
and peace of mind.

01:29:52.775 --> 01:29:55.234
You may step down now.
That's all for now.

Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

01:30:09.958 --> 01:30:12.585
You just dug your own grave.
Go fall in it.

Why don't you get off my tail?

- Orders.
- You're hot. You oughta be glad
we're followin' you.

01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:48.496
You're makin' me feel
like a canary.

01:30:48.622 --> 01:30:50.790
- Well?
- Lay off.

01:30:54.044 --> 01:30:55.795
Hiya, Chickie.

Who's your friend?

01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:35.501
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:39.297
No.

01:31:40.507 --> 01:31:43.509
Well, anyway, it's all over.

01:31:43.635 --> 01:31:46.012
My friends don't wanna talk to me.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.514
Are you sure they're your friends?

01:31:52.269 --> 01:31:53.811
Terry...

01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:57.982
I'll see you later.

Tommy?

01:33:34.246 --> 01:33:36.580
What'd he have to do that for?

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.293
Every one of 'em.

01:33:41.378 --> 01:33:44.797
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

01:33:45.882 --> 01:33:49.385
Maybe inland,
out west someplace.

01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:51.721
A farm.

01:33:51.847 --> 01:33:54.932
- "A farm"?
- You could do lots of things...

01:33:55.058 --> 01:33:57.601
anything, as long as you're away
from Johnny Friendly.

01:33:57.728 --> 01:34:00.855
And even the longshoremen... You try to
help them, and they just turn their backs...

01:34:00.981 --> 01:34:03.065
and stick to their stupid D and D.

01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:07.028
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?

01:34:07.154 --> 01:34:09.613
You're not even listening
to me, are you?

01:34:17.414 --> 01:34:19.290
You're going down there.

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:23.794
Just because John Friendly warned you
not to, you're going down there.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.757
You think you've got to prove
something to them, that you're
not afraid of them or something.

01:34:27.883 --> 01:34:29.675
Well, go ahead!
Get it over with!

01:34:29.801 --> 01:34:31.719
Go down to the shape-up

You stupid, pigheaded...
What are you trying to prove?

01:34:38.435 --> 01:34:40.686
They always said I was a bum.

01:34:42.272 --> 01:34:44.440
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

01:34:45.525 --> 01:34:48.527
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

01:34:48.653 --> 01:34:51.280
I'm just gonna go down there...

01:34:51.406 --> 01:34:53.366

- That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

Stop breathin' that clam sauce on me.
What's doin'?

01:36:23.623 --> 01:36:27.793
I wish you'd let me go to work
on that cheese-eater.

Where're them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're gonna need 'em.
