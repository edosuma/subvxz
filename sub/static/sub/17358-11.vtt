00:19.472 --> 00:21.241
Ah!

00:21.241 --> 00:23.576
Ow, God! Hi! Hey Tyson.

00:23.576 --> 00:25.011
You can't go to the newsstand anymore.

00:25.011 --> 00:26.112
I... I just wanted to go there

00:26.112 --> 00:27.280
and grab a couple snacks.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.448
You know, get away from Sue.

00:28.448 --> 00:29.582
We had kind of a rough night.

00:29.582 --> 00:31.551
Roofie's been arrested!

00:34.354 --> 00:35.555
Okay you can let go now, Tyson.

00:35.555 --> 00:36.656
I can't!

00:36.656 --> 00:37.657
My knuckles are caught

00:37.657 --> 00:39.158
in your braided bitch belt!

00:39.158 --> 00:40.326
Just let go! It's like a...

00:40.326 --> 00:41.461
it's like a raccoon trap.

00:41.461 --> 00:42.529
You gotta ease your fingers,

00:42.529 --> 00:43.563
ease the fingers open.

00:43.563 --> 00:45.431
There you go! See?

00:45.431 --> 00:46.499
Ah!

01:19.732 --> 01:21.267
You were such a careful

01:21.267 --> 01:22.468
and considerate drug dealer.

01:22.468 --> 01:23.570
Who took you down?

01:23.570 --> 01:25.071
Look, I never met the cop,

01:25.071 --> 01:26.673
but that big dick swings
to the name of Sid.

01:26.673 --> 01:28.074
Sid.

01:28.074 --> 01:29.776
Like Sid from the nursing home?

01:29.776 --> 01:31.711
I... I'm an undercover cop.

01:31.711 --> 01:34.180
I got intel for the precinct!

01:34.180 --> 01:36.516
That old fucker was like
one foot in the grave.

01:36.516 --> 01:38.484
His breath smelled like dead flowers!

01:38.484 --> 01:39.752
Look, we got a bigger problem, all right?

01:39.752 --> 01:41.454
All my product was confiscated.

01:41.454 --> 01:42.989
All of it.

01:42.989 --> 01:45.124
Even the special strain I was saving

01:45.124 --> 01:46.693
called Sue's finger.

01:46.693 --> 01:48.161
You named a special strain of weed

01:48.161 --> 01:49.262
after Sue's finger?

01:49.262 --> 01:50.663
You thoughtful devil, you.

01:50.663 --> 01:53.199
Listen, your dead girlfriend's finger

01:53.199 --> 01:55.635
is in a weed box in the evidence room!

01:55.635 --> 01:57.136
Okay well, lucky for us,

01:57.136 --> 01:59.072
I am a master improvoseur.

01:59.072 --> 02:01.507
- You're not.
- And a diplomat of disguise!

02:01.507 --> 02:02.742
Those two words don't even go together.

02:02.742 --> 02:04.677
- Read my lips.
- Through the phone?

02:04.677 --> 02:08.281
Yes. We are fine.

02:08.281 --> 02:10.083
I'ma fucking die in here.

02:17.523 --> 02:20.393
Officer Jeff... Jeffs... Jefferson...

02:20.393 --> 02:22.729
Jeff Jefferson reporting for duty.

02:22.729 --> 02:25.231
Preferably in the, uh, evidence room?

02:30.670 --> 02:32.338
Who's the hilarious asshole

02:32.338 --> 02:34.007
who ordered a stripper
for Teddy's birthday?

02:34.007 --> 02:35.441
Oh... no. I'm... I'm not that.

02:35.441 --> 02:36.709
Oh shit!

02:36.709 --> 02:38.077
You're that fat dude from TV!

02:38.077 --> 02:39.479
Nope! I'm not that either.

02:39.479 --> 02:41.247
I'm not... I, I'm just an officer

02:41.247 --> 02:42.548
of the law here.

02:42.548 --> 02:44.183
I button my pants up one side at a time

02:44.183 --> 02:45.618
just like everybody else.

02:45.618 --> 02:47.053
Oh, you big time me?

02:47.053 --> 02:49.088
You know what? Fuck you.

02:49.088 --> 02:50.523
With all... with all your teeth,

02:50.523 --> 02:51.724
and all your fingers,

02:51.724 --> 02:53.259
and all your ears.

02:53.259 --> 02:55.495
Why do you not have those things?

02:55.495 --> 02:56.562
I'm gonna fuck the fame

02:56.562 --> 02:57.597
off your face.

02:57.597 --> 02:59.499
- Ahh!!
- Hey!

02:59.499 --> 03:02.268
No! No, no!

03:11.978 --> 03:13.646
Improvoseur.

03:18.251 --> 03:19.385
Please be open, please be open,

03:19.385 --> 03:20.687
please be open.

03:21.587 --> 03:23.489
Ah, fuck a duck!

03:23.489 --> 03:25.058
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

03:25.058 --> 03:26.492
I would never actually fuck a duck. I mean,

03:26.492 --> 03:28.294
I can't even find the hole where the eggs

03:28.294 --> 03:29.629
come out... I mean, I can
find it, but I don't think

03:29.629 --> 03:31.230
you could even get a finger in there.

03:31.230 --> 03:32.398
Hands on your head, asshole!

03:32.398 --> 03:33.566
Okay look, look.

03:33.566 --> 03:34.801
You don't have to do this.

03:34.801 --> 03:36.102
This is just a big misunderstanding, okay?

03:36.102 --> 03:37.670
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

03:37.670 --> 03:39.338
As a matter of fact, I have.

03:39.338 --> 03:41.541
Oh!

03:41.541 --> 03:43.543
Oh, you're a ghost.

03:43.543 --> 03:45.244
Hey look, I can get in
a lot of trouble here.

03:45.244 --> 03:46.446
This is not the time or the place

03:46.446 --> 03:47.547
for a big, elaborate backstory.

03:47.547 --> 03:50.983
The year was 1989.

03:50.983 --> 03:52.285
I was hot on the trail

03:52.285 --> 03:54.020
of the most dangerous psychopath

03:54.020 --> 03:56.122
this city's ever seen.

03:56.122 --> 03:57.623
A serial killer?

03:57.623 --> 03:59.659
- A serial flasher.
- Oh.

03:59.659 --> 04:01.260
Needless to say, the guy left

04:01.260 --> 04:04.230
a bad taste in my mouth.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.298
And you guys never caught him?

04:05.298 --> 04:06.699
We thought we did.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.101
My partner Frank and I were working

04:08.101 --> 04:09.202
around the clock.

04:09.202 --> 04:10.436
After months of dead ends,

04:10.436 --> 04:12.772
we landed on the doorstep of a man

04:12.772 --> 04:15.007
named Johnny Penis.

04:17.009 --> 04:18.277
Wait, wait. Months?

04:18.277 --> 04:19.612
I would think with a name like Penis

04:19.612 --> 04:21.113
he would have been a suspect immediately.

04:21.113 --> 04:22.615
Don't interrupt a flashback, man!

04:22.615 --> 04:23.683
It's fucking rude!

04:23.683 --> 04:25.551
Yeah, I'm sorry, I hate that.

04:29.188 --> 04:32.024
I kicked in the door on a hunch.

04:32.024 --> 04:33.426
- Freeze, asshole!
- Oh, woah!

04:33.426 --> 04:35.094
Take it easy, fellas.

04:35.094 --> 04:37.597
Don't move a muscle!

04:37.597 --> 04:38.998
I just gotta tighten my robe.

04:38.998 --> 04:40.399
I said fucking freeze!

04:40.399 --> 04:42.201
You... watch the language, fella!

04:42.201 --> 04:45.238
We got kids here!

04:45.238 --> 04:47.073
Keep those hands where we can see 'em.

04:47.073 --> 04:48.508
You got me just right
out of the shower, let...

04:48.508 --> 04:50.076
You think we're fucking around?

04:50.076 --> 04:51.744
You don't wanna see my penis, do you?

04:51.744 --> 04:54.013
Last warning motherfucker!

05:10.663 --> 05:13.065
He didn't leave us much of a choice.

05:13.065 --> 05:15.201
No...

05:15.201 --> 05:18.237
Frank and I got medals and promotions.

05:18.237 --> 05:20.039
We were heroes.

05:20.039 --> 05:23.242
And the city felt safe again.

05:23.242 --> 05:25.611
That is, until it started back up.

05:25.611 --> 05:26.646
The flashing?

05:26.646 --> 05:29.382
Not just the flashing.

05:29.382 --> 05:31.317
The photos.

05:31.317 --> 05:33.419
The sick bastard used to take Polaroids

05:33.419 --> 05:35.054
of his victims' reactions.

05:35.054 --> 05:36.789
- No!
- Yeah.

05:36.789 --> 05:38.558
Frank wrote it off as a copycock.

05:38.558 --> 05:42.558
But something about it rubbed me off wrong.

05:43.229 --> 05:45.298
Did we catch the right guy?

05:45.298 --> 05:47.300
Unfortunately, I died

05:47.300 --> 05:48.568
before I could ever be sure.

05:48.568 --> 05:50.503
Okay, I get it, I get it.

05:50.503 --> 05:52.104
Your obsession with this case is what

05:52.104 --> 05:54.040
ultimately led to your demise, right?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.141
No.

05:55.141 --> 05:56.475
Motorcycle accident.

06:05.585 --> 06:08.154
Precinct had the worst
fucking mechanic back then.

06:08.154 --> 06:11.190
Well, maybe I can help you solve this case?

06:11.190 --> 06:13.593
Forget it, asshole, I only work alone.

06:13.593 --> 06:15.661
What? What about Frank?

06:17.330 --> 06:18.731
Fine. I just said that
because I don't want...

06:18.731 --> 06:20.433
- ... to work with you.
- Hey, like it or not,

06:20.433 --> 06:22.201
you need a living person
to solve this case,

06:22.201 --> 06:23.536
and I'm the only one who can see you.

06:23.536 --> 06:25.037
All right? And I need a ghost to help me

06:25.037 --> 06:26.372
get my girlfriend's finger out of

06:26.372 --> 06:27.406
this evidence room, and you're the only one

06:27.406 --> 06:29.041
who can get me in there.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.009
So it looks like we might be

06:30.009 --> 06:32.612
stuck together, partner.

06:32.612 --> 06:34.380
All right.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.582
- I got two rules, asshole.
- Hold, wait a minute.

06:36.582 --> 06:38.117
That's not, like, my new nickname, is it?

06:38.117 --> 06:39.619
First, don't call me partner.

06:39.619 --> 06:41.220
Okay, got it.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.322
And second, don't you dare embarrass me.

06:43.322 --> 06:44.757
I would never.

06:44.757 --> 06:47.026
Hey! What are you doing down here?

06:47.026 --> 06:49.362
I don't know. I'm lost and scared.

06:49.362 --> 06:50.563
Well, we're ready for you now.

06:50.563 --> 06:51.697
Okay.

06:51.697 --> 06:53.766
Give me a minute, partner.

07:04.677 --> 07:06.679
Detective Frank Powell?

07:06.679 --> 07:09.448
It's Chief Powell. Who the hell are you?

07:09.448 --> 07:11.717
Uh, I am Officer
Pacalioglu at your service.

07:11.717 --> 07:13.152
Uh!

07:13.152 --> 07:14.387
Jesus Christ, you're the stripper cop.

07:14.387 --> 07:15.721
How the fuck did you get in here?

07:15.721 --> 07:17.523
No, I'm not a stripper cop.

07:17.523 --> 07:19.025
I'm a medium, and I'm here

07:19.025 --> 07:23.029
with the ghost of your ex-partner Max.

07:23.029 --> 07:24.096
Max?

07:24.096 --> 07:26.399
Yeah, he's right here.

07:30.036 --> 07:31.537
You got one minute.

07:31.537 --> 07:33.072
Okay, that's all we need.

07:33.072 --> 07:36.242
We want to bust an old case wide open.

07:36.242 --> 07:38.077
What case?

07:38.077 --> 07:39.378
The Polaroid flasher.

07:39.378 --> 07:41.547
The Polaroid flasher.

07:41.547 --> 07:43.516
Jesus Christ, Max!

07:43.516 --> 07:45.117
You just can't let that thing go, can you?

07:45.117 --> 07:46.285
We caught the guy!

07:46.285 --> 07:47.086
We didn't find one Polaroid

07:47.086 --> 07:48.521
on Johnny Penis.

07:48.521 --> 07:49.722
And remind him there's been new victims.

07:49.722 --> 07:50.756
Max wants me to remind you

07:50.756 --> 07:52.024
there's been new victims.

07:52.024 --> 07:53.759
No, there's been copycocks.

07:53.759 --> 07:55.227
- Yeah, but they...
- All right?

07:55.227 --> 07:57.029
None of these new victims could pick

07:57.029 --> 07:58.264
a penis out of the lineup.

07:58.264 --> 07:59.765
- None of them!
- Wait.

07:59.765 --> 08:01.000
You guys actually did that?

08:01.000 --> 08:01.667
I'm gonna have to ask you

08:01.667 --> 08:03.369
to leave, stripper cop.

08:03.369 --> 08:04.971
Hey, I'm just tryin' to help with Max, man.

08:04.971 --> 08:07.340
- You know, we're jamming!
- Max is dead.

08:07.340 --> 08:10.209
Okay? And this case is closed.

08:10.209 --> 08:12.178
Now you can take your booty cheeks

08:12.178 --> 08:15.314
and clap them together somewhere else.

08:15.314 --> 08:16.549
I'm sorry. I feel like I

08:16.549 --> 08:18.217
really let you down up there, Max.

08:18.217 --> 08:20.186
26th West 30th Street.

08:20.186 --> 08:22.321
What's that? A good s'mizza place?

08:22.321 --> 08:24.357
It's the address of the last victim.

08:24.357 --> 08:26.359
I saw it in the file
before Frank humiliated you

08:26.359 --> 08:28.594
with that booty clap comment.

08:28.594 --> 08:30.262
I say we go pay her a visit.

08:30.262 --> 08:31.764
Yeah!

08:31.764 --> 08:33.631
Hey! That's not how we roll.

08:35.101 --> 08:37.336
Holy shit. Sweet ride!

08:37.336 --> 08:38.471
Hop in, asshole!

08:38.471 --> 08:40.072
Yeah, can do!

08:43.174 --> 08:44.643
All right, let's do this!

08:47.891 --> 08:49.493
I wish I could help you identify him,

08:49.493 --> 08:51.128
but he held the Polaroid camera

08:51.128 --> 08:53.797
directly in front of his face.

08:53.797 --> 08:56.266
He's a smart fucker, I'll give him that.

08:56.266 --> 08:58.468
Covers his face, flashes the damn camera

08:58.468 --> 09:00.203
right in his victim's eyes.

09:00.203 --> 09:02.272
Ma'am, I'm not interested in the face.

09:02.272 --> 09:04.941
Let's get into the meat of this, shall we?

09:04.941 --> 09:07.110
White?

09:07.110 --> 09:10.113
Black?

09:10.113 --> 09:11.748
Asian?

09:11.748 --> 09:13.250
I'd say white?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.518
You'd say white?

09:14.518 --> 09:16.219
It had a healthy glow to it.

09:16.219 --> 09:17.821
I see, okay.

09:17.821 --> 09:19.489
- Circumsized?
- No.

09:19.489 --> 09:21.057
It was a hooded hell hound.

09:21.057 --> 09:22.359
Mhm. Any curve to it?

09:22.359 --> 09:23.827
A little to the left.

09:23.827 --> 09:24.828
Veins?

09:24.828 --> 09:25.829
A few, on the side.

09:25.829 --> 09:26.997
Pube pattern?

09:26.997 --> 09:28.231
Freshly groomed.

09:28.231 --> 09:29.399
Like it had seen a trimmer

09:29.399 --> 09:33.003
that very morning.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.004
How's this?

09:34.004 --> 09:35.071
Oh, God!

09:35.071 --> 09:37.073
Oh, God. That's it.

09:37.073 --> 09:39.075
I... I... couldn't get out of its way;

09:39.075 --> 09:40.544
it flopped right at me!

09:40.544 --> 09:42.279
I need to know about the balls.

09:42.279 --> 09:43.346
She's had enough, man.

09:43.346 --> 09:45.348
Ask her about the balls!

09:45.348 --> 09:46.850
Ma'am, the ball placement?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.318
No, please, I can't take anymore.

09:48.318 --> 09:49.386
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- I need to know!

09:49.386 --> 09:50.887
Okay. Stay with me!

09:50.887 --> 09:52.355
Focus up and describe

09:52.355 --> 09:54.090
those dangly bastards to me.

09:54.090 --> 09:57.160
Oh, they were swinging.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.095
Ugh, I can still hear them slapping

09:59.095 --> 10:00.430
against his mid-thigh.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.199
- Mhm.
- All right?

10:02.199 --> 10:04.234
- Are you happy now?
- No!

10:04.234 --> 10:05.735
I didn't want you to cry!

10:05.735 --> 10:09.372
Aw, come... was that really necessary?

10:09.372 --> 10:10.907
- Mid-thigh.
- What?

10:10.907 --> 10:12.943
That testicular drooping is as consistent

10:12.943 --> 10:15.011
with a man in his mid-fifties.

10:15.011 --> 10:16.713
The exact age the Polaroid flasher

10:16.713 --> 10:18.415
would be if he were alive today.

10:18.415 --> 10:20.817
Holy shit.

10:20.817 --> 10:22.953
Are we hot on the trail of something?

10:22.953 --> 10:24.387
Unfortunately, we're fresh out of leads.

10:24.387 --> 10:25.889
Aw, fuck it.

10:25.889 --> 10:27.824
We've got nothing but droopy balls

10:27.824 --> 10:30.227
and a camera owned by
every family in the city.

10:30.227 --> 10:31.761
What, uh, the Polaroid?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.864
No, no, no, nobody uses
the Polaroid anymore.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.899
But he's still buying film. How?

10:35.899 --> 10:37.000
On the internet, probably?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.301
The what?

10:38.301 --> 10:40.837
Right, there was no internet back then!

10:40.837 --> 10:42.138
And a man in his fifties might

10:42.138 --> 10:44.307
wanna do things the old fashioned way.

10:44.307 --> 10:45.475
There's only one place in town I know

10:45.475 --> 10:47.177
that still sells Polaroid film.

10:47.177 --> 10:49.112
Right next to my favorite s'mizza parlor.

10:49.112 --> 10:50.847
Take me there, asshole.

10:50.847 --> 10:52.949
I think I'm starting to like that nickname.

11:02.058 --> 11:03.894
Vintage Polaroid 600 film.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.128
You carry it?

11:05.128 --> 11:06.463
It's not cheap.

11:06.463 --> 11:08.031
Sounds like our suspect has some cash

11:08.031 --> 11:10.333
to throw around these days.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.868
My partner and I are going to need the name

11:11.868 --> 11:13.036
and address of everybody who's bought

11:13.036 --> 11:14.404
that film in the past...

11:14.404 --> 11:15.972
- Ten years.
- Ten years.

11:15.972 --> 11:17.040
You ever hear of

11:17.040 --> 11:18.508
camera-customer confidentiality?

11:18.508 --> 11:19.509
Oh, shit, is that a thing?

11:19.509 --> 11:21.211
Is he making that up?

11:21.211 --> 11:23.113
Slam this motherfucker's
head against the counter!

11:23.113 --> 11:24.781
Yeah, what do I do? Just
grab him by the ears?

11:24.781 --> 11:26.716
- By the fucking neck?
- The moment's gone, now.

11:26.716 --> 11:27.817
But I'm like in the middle of doin' it!

11:27.817 --> 11:29.452
I'm calling the cops.

11:29.452 --> 11:30.754
No you're not, 'cause they're already here,

11:30.754 --> 11:31.855
butterface!

11:31.855 --> 11:33.290
All right. Take it easy.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.457
I'll just run in the back

11:34.457 --> 11:36.826
and grab the books, right now.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.296
You get the books, and then I'll relax.

11:41.798 --> 11:44.267
So, uh, when do I get my gun, partner?

11:44.267 --> 11:45.936
Never. And you really need

11:45.936 --> 11:47.804
to stop referring to us as partners.

11:47.804 --> 11:49.439
This is a classic partner quarrel.

11:49.439 --> 11:50.941
We're strangers.

11:50.941 --> 11:53.043
We do this one job and we're done.

11:53.043 --> 11:54.477
Don't think I'm gonna sit here

11:54.477 --> 11:56.146
and open up to you

11:56.146 --> 11:58.148
about my lesbian ex-wife.

11:58.148 --> 12:00.951
That never crossed my mind.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.252
Bitch.

12:02.252 --> 12:03.820
No, I thought we'd start small, you know?

12:03.820 --> 12:05.055
Like, what's your favorite kind of candy?

12:05.055 --> 12:06.323
Got you pegged as a Kit Kat guy.

12:06.323 --> 12:07.824
- Give me a break.
- Turkish delight?

12:07.824 --> 12:09.125
- You start...
- Watermelon nerds?

12:09.125 --> 12:10.327
You start talking about personal stuff

12:10.327 --> 12:12.195
and you're not focusing, all right?

12:12.195 --> 12:16.132
- You miss shit.
- What kinda shit?

12:16.132 --> 12:17.167
Oh, clerk!

12:17.167 --> 12:18.335
God!

12:19.769 --> 12:22.072
Ah, damn it!

12:22.072 --> 12:23.406
Oh, well.

12:23.406 --> 12:24.841
I'm sure we'll find another lead.

12:24.841 --> 12:25.942
Chase him!

12:25.942 --> 12:27.277
It seems pretty fruitless now,

12:27.277 --> 12:28.812
I mean, he's like halfway down the...

12:32.215 --> 12:33.817
Oh, uh-uh.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.954
Sorry for your loss!

12:45.462 --> 12:46.429
You better start talking,

12:46.429 --> 12:48.398
or I start stompin'!

12:48.398 --> 12:49.466
Go ahead.

12:49.466 --> 12:50.900
This is a vintage store.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.736
This shit's all broken anyway.

12:52.736 --> 12:54.204
Do you have any camera bags?

12:54.204 --> 12:55.505
Oh, on the back wall.

12:55.505 --> 12:57.140
To the left.

12:58.141 --> 12:59.843
It's back there.

12:59.843 --> 13:00.910
Time to turn up the heat.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.278
Fuck yeah.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.915
Woah, okay, okay. I'll talk.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.118
Really? Just like that?

13:08.118 --> 13:09.252
Yes.

13:09.252 --> 13:10.353
I can't afford to be closed

13:10.353 --> 13:11.254
in the middle of the day.

13:11.254 --> 13:12.522
Are you fucking crazy?

13:12.522 --> 13:13.857
Yeah, let me think about that.

13:13.857 --> 13:15.325
Yes I'm fucking crazy!

13:15.325 --> 13:16.860
I'm fucking nuts.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.528
- We want some names.
- We want some names!

13:18.528 --> 13:20.296
Well, there's this one guy...

13:20.296 --> 13:21.965
There's this one guy!

13:21.965 --> 13:23.166
- There's this one guy...
- One guy!

13:23.166 --> 13:24.300
One guy who keeps buying

13:24.300 --> 13:26.336
a lot of Polaroid 600 stock.

13:26.336 --> 13:28.938
Oh yeah?

13:28.938 --> 13:32.275
Let me ask you something.

13:32.275 --> 13:35.845
Dick look anything like this?

13:35.845 --> 13:37.313
Let me jog your memory.

13:37.313 --> 13:39.082
What's his dick look like, fuckface?

13:39.082 --> 13:41.284
I... I... I don't know.

13:41.284 --> 13:44.821
I just know his name is, uh, Barry.

13:44.821 --> 13:47.023
That's a good start.

13:47.023 --> 13:48.358
Weinberger...

13:48.358 --> 13:49.859
Oh, you're still going, that's great.

13:49.859 --> 13:51.861
... stein.

13:51.861 --> 13:53.430
Sorry, did you just say
Barry Weinbergerstein?

13:53.430 --> 13:55.398
- Yeah.
- You know him?

13:55.398 --> 13:58.768
Holy shit, yeah, I know him.

13:58.768 --> 14:00.070
He's the fucking president of...

14:00.070 --> 14:01.371
The president is a Jew?

14:01.371 --> 14:03.139
What? No. Worse.

14:03.139 --> 14:04.441
A woman?

14:04.441 --> 14:05.475
No, I didn't mean worse like that.

14:05.475 --> 14:07.110
I meant...

14:07.110 --> 14:08.511
This is bigger than any political scandal

14:08.511 --> 14:09.913
you could ever think of.

14:09.913 --> 14:11.114
This could shake up the entire

14:11.114 --> 14:12.882
reality entertainment industry.

14:12.882 --> 14:15.085
Barry Weinbergerstein

14:15.085 --> 14:16.820
is the President of Alt TV.

14:16.820 --> 14:20.090
The president of all TV?

14:21.458 --> 14:24.461
Would that raise the stakes for you?

14:24.461 --> 14:25.762
Fuck yeah.

14:25.762 --> 14:27.097
Then sure, yeah, that's him.

14:32.069 --> 14:34.071
This goes all the way to the top...

14:34.071 --> 14:35.572
of reality TV.

14:35.572 --> 14:37.608
Who the fuck keeps letting stripper cop in?

14:37.608 --> 14:39.343
Listen to me, Frank. The Polaroid flasher

14:39.343 --> 14:40.644
is still out there.

14:40.644 --> 14:42.112
Max and I discovered his true identity.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.615
Look, let me stop you right there, okay?

14:44.615 --> 14:47.251
I need to make something
really clear to you.

14:47.251 --> 14:49.586
If I catch you playing
cop in my city again,

14:49.586 --> 14:51.655
I'm gonna have you arrested, locked up...

14:51.655 --> 14:53.257
Let me guess, you're
gonna throw away the key.

14:53.257 --> 14:54.558
No, no!

14:54.558 --> 14:56.126
I'm gonna shove it up your asshole!

14:56.126 --> 14:57.094
That's what I'm gonna do!

14:57.094 --> 14:58.662
Be a big mistake, pal.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.264
I could eventually poop that key out

15:00.264 --> 15:02.633
and free myself.

15:02.633 --> 15:04.301
Look, this is over, stripper cop.

15:04.301 --> 15:06.136
Okay? Case closed.

15:06.136 --> 15:08.072
Now I want you to clap
your ass on out of here.

15:08.072 --> 15:09.473
- Get to clappin'!
- All right, I'll go!

15:09.473 --> 15:12.176
But you should know
one thing before I do...

15:12.176 --> 15:14.645
Max is disappointed in you.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.548
I never said that.

15:17.548 --> 15:19.483
You didn't have to.

15:25.122 --> 15:26.323
Max, I think this is where you and I

15:26.323 --> 15:27.524
part ways.

15:27.524 --> 15:29.026
- What?
- Yeah.

15:29.026 --> 15:30.661
But we're so close.

15:30.661 --> 15:32.496
Did you hear Frank up there?

15:32.496 --> 15:34.031
He's gonna throw me in jail.

15:34.031 --> 15:35.299
If that happens, I won't be able

15:35.299 --> 15:37.234
to get what I need out of jail.

15:37.234 --> 15:39.503
And I'll have a key jammed up my ass.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.004
That was not part of the plan, Max.

15:41.004 --> 15:42.072
I'm sorry.

15:42.072 --> 15:43.640
It's fine.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.209
I was a fucking fool for thinking

15:45.209 --> 15:47.378
you'd ever see this through.

15:47.378 --> 15:49.246
- Well...
- You're not a real cop.

15:49.246 --> 15:50.647
That's true. I'm really not.

15:50.647 --> 15:52.683
You're a stripper cop.

15:52.683 --> 15:56.019
Well, actually, I'm not that either, uhh...

15:56.019 --> 15:58.389
Is this what you were looking for?

15:58.389 --> 16:00.391
Oh my God! Sue's finger!

16:00.391 --> 16:02.426
- Oh!
- Yeah.

16:02.426 --> 16:04.561
Go finger fuck yourself.

16:11.301 --> 16:12.503
Sue?

16:57.915 --> 16:59.249
Is this seat taken?

16:59.249 --> 17:02.186
Get out of my car, you walking abortion.

17:02.186 --> 17:03.921
All right, I deserve that.

17:03.921 --> 17:05.355
It's harsh, but I deserve it.

17:05.355 --> 17:06.924
Listen, I just want you to know,

17:06.924 --> 17:09.159
if you let me sit here,
I won't embarrass you,

17:09.159 --> 17:10.560
I will not call you partner,

17:10.560 --> 17:12.396
and I won't even ask you
any personal questions...

17:12.396 --> 17:14.198
nothing about what your favorite candy is.

17:14.198 --> 17:16.433
Nothing. I swear.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.701
Okay?

17:17.701 --> 17:20.170
I just wanna see this thing through.

17:25.309 --> 17:26.410
Okay, asshole.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.178
All right.

17:28.178 --> 17:32.216
All right, let's get down to biz.

17:32.216 --> 17:33.550
Oh, there is some messed up shit

17:33.550 --> 17:35.486
going on up there, Barry Weinbergerstein.

17:35.486 --> 17:37.287
Calling all units! We just got a report.

17:37.287 --> 17:40.090
There's a flashing on Flushing Avenue.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.291
Could be any flasher.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.526
Suspect has a penis that curves

17:42.526 --> 17:44.661
slightly to the left.

17:44.661 --> 17:46.363
That's pretty common.

17:46.363 --> 17:47.698
Mine did.

17:47.698 --> 17:50.501
Suspect is moving south
with a Polaroid camera.

17:50.501 --> 17:51.602
Polaroid camera.

17:51.602 --> 17:53.003
Shit! That's our guy!

17:53.003 --> 17:54.004
Let's bust him!

18:07.184 --> 18:08.652
Damn it!

18:08.652 --> 18:11.021
Where'd I put that extra film?

18:11.021 --> 18:12.456
Oh yeah, that's right.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.162
Cover me, partner!

18:27.604 --> 18:29.006
Oh!

18:33.143 --> 18:34.344
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:34.344 --> 18:37.147
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

18:37.147 --> 18:38.315
Where are we?

18:38.315 --> 18:40.183
We found the flasher's den.

18:40.183 --> 18:42.085
Holy shit.

18:44.588 --> 18:46.290
This one's dated yesterday.

18:46.290 --> 18:49.526
This must be his pube trimmer.

18:49.526 --> 18:50.527
It's still warm.

18:50.527 --> 18:51.461
He was just here.

18:51.461 --> 18:52.696
No.

18:52.696 --> 18:53.964
I'm still here.

18:55.332 --> 18:56.166
Woah!

19:05.976 --> 19:07.678
How could you do this to me, Frank?

19:07.678 --> 19:10.381
Wait a second. You're the Polaroid flasher?

19:10.381 --> 19:12.049
Dude, seriously, you have the most

19:12.049 --> 19:14.785
racially ambiguous penis
I have ever sketched.

19:14.785 --> 19:16.153
On the count of three,

19:16.153 --> 19:17.755
I'm gonna slide you the pube trimmer.

19:17.755 --> 19:19.890
Don't hesitate, just jam it in his neck!

19:19.890 --> 19:23.127
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

19:23.127 --> 19:24.828
Why can he hear me?

19:24.828 --> 19:26.196
- I don't know.
- Shut up!

19:26.196 --> 19:27.765
Shut up. You know what?

19:27.765 --> 19:30.934
- I'll shut you up.
- Oh, boy.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.272
Oh, not like that.

19:35.272 --> 19:37.174
What did... who the hell is that?

19:37.174 --> 19:38.942
That's Johnny Penis!

19:38.942 --> 19:40.678
That's Johnny Penis?

19:40.678 --> 19:42.079
Oh, he must not have gone into his light.

19:42.079 --> 19:43.747
Damn right, I didn't go into the light.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.215
You assholes shot me before I got

19:45.215 --> 19:47.051
the perfect reaction photo!

19:47.051 --> 19:48.786
And I wasn't going without it.

19:48.786 --> 19:51.188
Fortunately, I learned about possession.

19:51.188 --> 19:53.824
And after inhabiting a few dirty hobos,

19:53.824 --> 19:55.392
I found the perfect vessel

19:55.392 --> 19:57.227
to continue my crimes.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.096
A decorated cop.

19:59.096 --> 20:01.365
Who got blackout drunk every night.

20:01.365 --> 20:02.800
I'm taking you down

20:02.800 --> 20:04.868
once and for all, Johnny Penis.

20:04.868 --> 20:07.104
Looks like we finally
got our man, huh, partner?

20:07.104 --> 20:08.939
Yeah, I'm still not really
comfortable with that.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.708
That's okay, yeah, it was a little early.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.777
Hey, what... what's going on?

20:13.777 --> 20:15.212
Uh, it's a little hard to explain.

20:15.212 --> 20:16.880
You had Penis inside you.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.982
I had Penis inside me?

20:18.982 --> 20:20.317
That's it, stripper cop!

20:20.317 --> 20:22.386
- You're under arrest.
- Me? No! What?

20:26.056 --> 20:29.159
Oh, shit.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.861
I'm walkin' outta here.

20:30.861 --> 20:32.129
Don't try and stop me.

20:39.303 --> 20:42.740
Say cheese, asshole!

20:42.740 --> 20:44.007
Yeah!

20:45.209 --> 20:47.845
It's over, Johnny Penis.

20:47.845 --> 20:49.780
You've been clipped.

20:49.780 --> 20:53.650
- Nice!
- Oh my God.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.119
That face!

20:55.119 --> 20:56.854
Surprised.

20:56.854 --> 20:59.690
Disgusted.

20:59.690 --> 21:01.125
And yet intrigued.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.894
I wouldn't say intrigued...

21:03.894 --> 21:06.730
It's the perfect reaction photo.

21:06.730 --> 21:08.098
It's the... it's the perfect

21:08.098 --> 21:09.666
reaction photo!

21:17.708 --> 21:19.143
- Hey, Pac.
- Yeah?

21:19.143 --> 21:22.246
Good & Plenty, that's my favorite candy.

21:22.246 --> 21:23.680
Really?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.849
Those are fucking gross.

21:35.092 --> 21:36.894
Case closed.

21:38.262 --> 21:42.065
- What happened?
- There you go.

21:42.065 --> 21:45.369
You saved me from myself.

21:45.369 --> 21:46.637
I did.

21:46.637 --> 21:47.805
Good job, stripper cop.

21:47.805 --> 21:49.006
Thank you.

21:49.006 --> 21:52.242
Good job!

21:52.242 --> 21:53.811
I gotta stop drinking so much.

21:53.811 --> 21:54.845
Ha!

21:54.845 --> 21:56.113
I'll drink to that.

21:56.113 --> 21:57.748
You buyin'?
