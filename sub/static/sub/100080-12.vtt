You let Nate walk away

Good to know.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.921
Nice work, Street.
Thanks.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.258
You guys sold it.
I think I'm in.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.894
One thing working undercover
ten years has taught me:

02:08.963 --> 02:10.929
getting in is easy.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.431
The tricky part
is getting out.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.172
NOLAN: Looks like
business is good.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.074
People can't get enough
of the new batch.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.878
Street, where should
our friend be selling?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.446
Crenshaw.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.414
Olympic Division's
underfunded right now.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.984
Patrol's less saturated.
Appreciate the advice,

02:32.052 --> 02:35.387
but police aren't our
biggest problem right now.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.788
We got a new headache.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.023
The Forty-Twos are
getting trigger happy

02:38.092 --> 02:39.625
about us stepping
on their territory.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.260
We're expanding
in a new direction.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.129
I don't need the complications
right now.

02:44.198 --> 02:47.299
Street, what's good territory?

02:47.368 --> 02:48.901
A few possibilities.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.269
You want a drink?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.904
Got anyone else
who can pour it?

02:51.972 --> 02:54.206
That'll make a difference?
Yeah.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.375
I prefer a clean glass,

02:56.443 --> 02:58.377
brother.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.378
If you expand,

02:59.446 --> 03:01.146
go north.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.714
Midday in Wilshire
is lowest deployed watch.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.782
Less cops, less problems.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.484
NATE:
What'd you call me?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.054
I will put two bullets
in you and your boy

03:09.123 --> 03:10.856
before you even think
about pulling that gun.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.566
House-train your new pet, Nolan.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.569
The intel isn't worth
the hassle.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.242
(door closes)

03:30.311 --> 03:32.811
We agreed on two weeks.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.014
Once I close the deal
with my new supplier,

03:36.083 --> 03:37.249
your debt is finished.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.383
How long will that be?

03:41.989 --> 03:44.089
It'll go a lot faster

03:44.158 --> 03:46.058
if you stop threatening
my customers.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.332
Sorry I'm late.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.434
Nate got into it
with a neo-Nazi.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.970
Gave him hell, I hope.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.204
Of course.

03:59.273 --> 04:03.442
Nolan sold ten keys tonight
to the Aryans.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.177
They're expanding into Wilshire;
we should lay off up there,

04:05.246 --> 04:06.712
prove my intel's valuable.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.714
This is really
good work, Street.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.482
Two weeks in, and
you have uncovered

04:10.551 --> 04:12.818
Nolan's whole
distribution network.

04:12.886 --> 04:13.986
Maybe it's time
we finally move.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.154
We hit now, get a hundred
dealers off the street.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.956
It won't mean anything unless
we find the guy on top--

04:18.025 --> 04:19.725
Nolan's new supplier.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.195
Nolan thinks he can become
this supplier's main seller.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.530
The way he's been talking
about this new shipment,

04:25.599 --> 04:27.699
it has to be any day now.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.469
We still don't know how
or where they're moving it in.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.803
If we got a pure sample
of the heroin,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.071
it would tell us
where it originated.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.239
We could start there.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.407
The Aryans just restocked.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.509
I mean, you hit them
before they dilute it...

04:37.578 --> 04:39.478
The Aryans are one step
from you in the food chain.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.180
We can't risk them connecting
a bust back to you.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.849
They're in the middle of a
turf beef with the Forty-Twos.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.584
You stage it right,
they don't have to know

04:45.653 --> 04:46.818
it's SWAT robbing them.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.720
(sighs)

04:48.789 --> 04:50.055
Sir, it looks like
it's time to finally

04:50.124 --> 04:52.257
bring in the rest
of the team.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.693
If SWAT can find out how
the drugs are coming in,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.528
can you get us a when?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.230
Yeah, I'll do my best.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.232
I gotta get back to Nate's.
Street.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.900
Yeah?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.435
How are you holding up?

05:05.306 --> 05:08.707
Tan keeps texting me,
checking in.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.009
Chris, she stopped
after a few days.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.446
I know I can't respond,
it's just...

05:14.515 --> 05:15.914
(Street sighs)

05:15.983 --> 05:17.883
It's been the hardest part
of this whole thing, you know.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.785
I hate keeping this
from them, too.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.553
It's all gonna be worth it

05:21.622 --> 05:22.954
when we get Nate
out of there.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.423
I just hope they understand.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.524
Street, he's your brother.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.793
I get it, and so will they.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.330
Let's just finish this thing.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.533
Thanks.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.205
This is the longest we've ever
had a SWAT officer undercover.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.240
This type of work
takes patience.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.042
And like I told
the top brass,

05:44.111 --> 05:45.544
I bet my career on this op.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.712
And Street's life.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.552
What's with the 4:00 a.m. SOS?

05:53.620 --> 05:56.088
We're not on early call.
What's going on?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.556
We needed the privacy.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.792
All right, listen up.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.494
There's something
Commander Hicks and I

06:02.563 --> 06:03.962
have had to keep from you.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.230
Now, we wanted to
tell you earlier,

06:05.299 --> 06:06.732
but the operation was
only approved

06:06.800 --> 06:08.300
if we could keep the circle
really small.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.735
What's this got to do
with Street?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.070
Two weeks ago, Street came to me
and Hicks asking for help.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.740
His foster brother Nate
found himself in trouble

06:14.808 --> 06:16.475
with a crew down in Long Beach.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.677
Turns out Nate was a witness
to a large-scale

06:18.746 --> 06:20.312
heroin smuggling operation.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.913
HICKS:
Though it operates
out of Long Beach,

06:21.982 --> 06:24.683
the reach of the network comes
all the way up here to L.A.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.651
"And given his relationshp
with Nate, and his history

06:26.720 --> 06:28.520
both with Long Beach and SWAT,

06:28.589 --> 06:31.289
we agreed to plant Street
within the organization

06:31.358 --> 06:33.692
as a disgraced member
of the LAPD.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.327
He's been undercover
this entire time?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.195
We watched him quit.
That was all theater?

06:37.264 --> 06:38.497
Not so much

06:38.565 --> 06:39.865
for any of you,
but for the civilians

06:39.933 --> 06:41.933
and non-SWAT crowd
that was there that day.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.703
We needed word to spread that
Street was truly done for good.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.304
That he had burned bridges.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.539
You could have trusted us
with this.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.040
HICKS: It's an
unfortunate necessity.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.943
Like it or not, your
reactions to Street quitting

06:52.012 --> 06:53.345
helped sell his cover.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.113
HONDO:
Let me be very clear.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.314
Every call was
authorized by me,

06:56.383 --> 06:58.283
so if you have a gripe,
you take it up with me,

06:58.352 --> 06:59.384
but you do it later.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.952
Right now,
we've got work to do.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.221
Now, the bar Street worked
is a way station between

07:03.290 --> 07:06.558
whoever's importing the heroin
and the sellers on the street.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.493
The owner of the bar,
Teague Nolan,

07:08.562 --> 07:09.694
sells to bikers,
bangers, whoever.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.996
This guy doesn't discriminate.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.898
Once it's sold,
it's out of his hands

07:12.966 --> 07:14.666
and in the people's veins.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.836
We've been on the sidelines, but
we're about to get in the game.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.739
We're gonna raid the last crew
that Nolan sold to.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.674
We're gonna grab the heroin,
and we're gonna learn

07:22.743 --> 07:24.543
how this stuff is
being brought in.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.811
Won't that risk
Street's cover?

07:25.879 --> 07:28.647
Not if we roll
as a rival crew.
We pulling a rip?

07:28.715 --> 07:29.815
Warrant's already been signed.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.249
Nolan's new shipment
could arrive any day.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.718
And if we miss it,
it could be months before

07:33.787 --> 07:35.520
we get another shot to topple
this entire pyramid.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.322
So let's take

07:37.391 --> 07:39.191
these sons of bitches down

07:39.259 --> 07:41.593
and bring Street home.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.598
♪ ♪

08:19.597 --> 08:21.197
All right, we're looking for

Stay out of Forty-Two territory.

09:18.055 --> 09:19.822
I heard the Aryans just got hit.

09:19.891 --> 09:22.324
I got a few ideas
who might be behind it.

09:22.393 --> 09:24.193
What?

09:24.262 --> 09:25.895
It's one thing to be
giving out street tips

09:25.963 --> 09:27.563
to Nolan when he
asks for 'em,

09:27.632 --> 09:30.099
but now you're going out
looking for stuff on your own?

09:30.168 --> 09:32.501
I mean, what if
something happens to you?

09:32.570 --> 09:34.036
The faster Nolan's
product sells,

09:34.105 --> 09:36.605
the faster you and I
can get out of this.

09:36.674 --> 09:38.240
And you really think,
once he does the deal,

09:38.309 --> 09:39.575
he's gonna let us go, huh?

09:39.644 --> 09:40.843
Come on.

09:42.146 --> 09:45.281
Maybe it's time we bail.
Okay, go to another state.

09:45.349 --> 09:46.615
I can't run.

09:46.684 --> 09:48.717
Nolan has me on video.

09:48.786 --> 09:50.719
You and I are
in too deep.

09:50.788 --> 09:52.721
I just-- I just need you
to trust me.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.423
I need you both
to clear out tonight.

09:54.492 --> 09:56.091
I'm having a meeting in here.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.259
Why do we have to clear out?

09:58.763 --> 10:00.596
Because you're not invited.

10:00.665 --> 10:03.465
And I don't need you
making a fool out of me again

10:03.534 --> 10:05.301
in front of company.
You know,

10:05.369 --> 10:07.303
you're trying so hard
to impress this new supplier.

10:07.371 --> 10:08.771
Having someone
with my experience

10:08.840 --> 10:11.240
can only add to your value.

10:11.309 --> 10:13.309
I said no.

10:13.377 --> 10:16.612
Your only job is
to do what I say.

10:16.681 --> 10:17.813
So get lost.

10:17.882 --> 10:18.814
NATE:
Jim,

10:18.883 --> 10:19.882
just drop it.

10:26.824 --> 10:28.657
STREET:
<i> I have to go.</i>

10:28.726 --> 10:30.292
They're meeting tonight.

10:30.361 --> 10:32.728
Whoever this new supplier is,
he's gonna be there.

10:32.797 --> 10:34.330
Absolutely not.

10:34.398 --> 10:36.131
If there's even a small chance
of side-stepping this guy

10:36.200 --> 10:37.800
to get to his boss,
we need to take it.

10:37.869 --> 10:38.901
It's too dangerous.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.135
We could set up
a surveillance,

10:40.204 --> 10:41.570
try to I.D. the
supplier that way.

10:41.639 --> 10:43.239
Nolan is paranoid.

10:43.307 --> 10:45.107
He's gonna be
double-checking everything

10:45.176 --> 10:46.976
before inviting this
guy in the building.

10:47.044 --> 10:49.311
If he sniffs anything,
anything funny,

10:49.380 --> 10:50.679
this whole op goes down
the drain.

10:53.384 --> 10:55.517
So we get anything
from the rip yet?

10:55.586 --> 10:57.753
They traced the heroin
back to Southeast Asia,

10:57.822 --> 10:59.188
specifically to a region

10:59.257 --> 11:00.956
near one or two
Malaysian shipping ports.

11:01.025 --> 11:02.191
So it's got to be coming

11:02.260 --> 11:03.692
through the Port of L.A.,
not through Mexico.

11:03.761 --> 11:05.027
That's the largest port
in the U.S.

11:05.096 --> 11:07.196
Even knowing where the drugs
are coming from, there are still

11:07.265 --> 11:10.532
thousands of containers
being brought in 24-7.

11:10.635 --> 11:12.701
So that's it then.
I have to go to this meeting.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.404
I got to see if I can narrow
down when it's coming in.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.341
Street, are you sure about this?

11:20.344 --> 11:21.777
If we can end this

11:21.846 --> 11:24.179
and get Nate out alive,
we have to try.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.615
We won't be able to bring backup
or even give you a wire.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.784
I know.
(sighs)

11:30.187 --> 11:32.288
All right.
All right,

11:32.356 --> 11:34.223
we're gonna do it, but
we're gonna be smart about it.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.691
We're gonna give you
a real reason

11:35.760 --> 11:37.860
to walk in there uninvited.
Lieutenant,

11:37.929 --> 11:40.195
can you get Long Beach PD
on the phone?
I'm on it.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.132
You're not going in there
empty-handed.

11:44.535 --> 11:47.002
(sniffles)

11:47.071 --> 11:50.306
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

11:50.374 --> 11:53.842
Nolan said to get lost.
Got new intel for
him. Can't wait.

11:53.911 --> 11:55.411
So give it to me,
and I'll take it to him.

11:55.479 --> 11:57.179
I'm getting inside this bar
one way or another.

11:57.248 --> 11:58.714
Remember what happened
the last time

11:58.783 --> 12:00.416
you and I danced, Barber?

12:00.484 --> 12:02.718
You want a rematch?

12:08.492 --> 12:10.960
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:11.929 --> 12:13.262
Oh!

12:14.265 --> 12:16.165
(grunting)

12:18.169 --> 12:22.338
When are you gonna understand
your place in all of this?

12:22.406 --> 12:24.740
Long Beach PD is on its way
to the Jackals' stash house.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.175
I wait outside

12:26.243 --> 12:27.710
like you want,
the Jackals

12:27.778 --> 12:29.378
and whatever heroin
they haven't sold

12:29.447 --> 12:32.114
is locked up before
this meeting's over.

12:32.183 --> 12:35.117
How's it gonna look
to your new supplier

12:35.186 --> 12:38.821
if your biggest dealer is facing
20 years unless he gives you up?

12:43.327 --> 12:44.460
Now you're sure about this?

12:44.528 --> 12:47.363
I blew up my life to help Nate,

12:47.431 --> 12:52.067
and as you've made it
perfectly clear, you own us.

12:52.136 --> 12:54.069
So why would I throw it
all away now?

12:54.138 --> 12:55.971
Yeah, quite a life

12:56.040 --> 12:57.206
you imploded there.

12:57.274 --> 12:59.875
Decorated career. Twice.

12:59.944 --> 13:02.044
Your team is your family.

13:02.113 --> 13:03.946
And, uh,

13:04.015 --> 13:06.782
you're-you're dating
the boss's daughter,

13:06.851 --> 13:09.051
right? Yeah.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.652
I know all about her.

13:10.721 --> 13:13.455
Very pretty. I've
seen the pictures.

13:13.524 --> 13:15.624
You would give her up

13:15.693 --> 13:18.861
just to help a foster brother?

13:20.197 --> 13:22.231
LUDLOW:
Take it easy on him, Nolan.

13:28.406 --> 13:30.839
Isn't this what you have him
around here for?

13:31.876 --> 13:33.809
Call your customers.

13:33.878 --> 13:37.012
Let's see how valuable
this kid really is.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.030
Can't find anything over
a hundred calories in there.

13:55.099 --> 13:56.899
Stress eating won't
make you feel any better.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.535
Well, actually, it usually does.

14:01.205 --> 14:03.772
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

14:03.841 --> 14:06.375
I challenged your authority
in front of Hondo and Street.

14:06.444 --> 14:07.643
It's your mission.

14:07.711 --> 14:10.012
They're your team.
It wasn't my place.

14:11.582 --> 14:13.515
I'm just worried about Street.

14:13.584 --> 14:16.819
Well, I brought you something
that might help.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.454
Are you nuts?

14:18.522 --> 14:20.856
This is the hardest part
for me, too.

14:22.093 --> 14:24.460
The waiting.

14:24.528 --> 14:27.329
I know you think
I only care about my career,

14:27.398 --> 14:31.133
but I've been doing this job
a long time, just like you.

14:31.202 --> 14:32.734
To get through
an op like this,

14:32.803 --> 14:35.871
you have to focus
on the mission outcome.

14:35.940 --> 14:41.009
We can't get caught up worrying
every second about our asset.

14:41.078 --> 14:43.045
Or we'll both go crazy.

14:43.114 --> 14:45.013
Do you trust him? Street?

14:45.082 --> 14:46.648
100%.

14:46.717 --> 14:49.051
So there's nothing
we can do but wait.

14:50.221 --> 14:52.221
And drink.

14:55.759 --> 14:56.892
(exhales)

14:56.961 --> 14:58.527
This is water.

14:58.596 --> 15:00.262
(chuckles):
Well, it wasn't always.

15:00.331 --> 15:02.498
But rituals don't care
if you quit drinking.

15:02.566 --> 15:07.069
It always helped to have
something to distract me.

15:14.578 --> 15:16.245
How long you been on the wagon?

15:17.515 --> 15:20.449
It's not something
I count anymore.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.085
Fair enough.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.455
(door opens)

15:26.524 --> 15:28.090
The Jackals did not appreciate

15:28.159 --> 15:30.192
having to flush their stash
for no reason.

15:30.261 --> 15:35.364
Then, ten minutes later, the
LBPD kicked in their door.

15:35.432 --> 15:38.300
Fortunately, there was
nothing left for them to find.

15:38.369 --> 15:40.202
Cops left empty-handed.

15:41.338 --> 15:43.238
You saved us a big hassle.

15:43.307 --> 15:45.207
Let me introduce myself.

15:45.276 --> 15:46.875
I'm Frank Ludlow.

15:46.944 --> 15:49.411
Jim Street.
You must be Nolan's supplier.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.413
You do good work, Jim.

15:51.482 --> 15:53.415
You cleaned up those bodies
without a fuss.

15:53.484 --> 15:57.419
I keep waiting for
them to turn up.

15:57.488 --> 15:58.954
How did you pull that off?

16:00.691 --> 16:02.658
Well, that's a secret.

16:03.727 --> 16:05.727
Protects both of us
for me not to tell you.

16:06.997 --> 16:08.797
(laughs)

16:09.867 --> 16:11.633
You have impeccable timing.

16:11.702 --> 16:14.203
We were just about ready
to go over tonight's shipment.

16:15.306 --> 16:16.405
Sit down.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.279
You heard from Street?

16:24.348 --> 16:26.081
I got him for about 30
seconds after he left the bar.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.649
He met the supplier.
Shipment's arriving tonight.

16:27.718 --> 16:29.284
Is this our guy?

16:29.353 --> 16:31.253
Frank Ludlow, son of shipping
magnate Charles Ludlow.

16:31.322 --> 16:32.921
HICKS:
Guess he couldn't make it

16:32.990 --> 16:34.523
in the family business;
found a nice side hustle

16:34.592 --> 16:36.992
moving drugs
on Daddy's boats.

16:37.061 --> 16:39.828
Street find out which boat?
No,

16:39.897 --> 16:43.198
but there's only one Ludlow ship
from Malaysia arriving tonight.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.200
We need to grab Ludlow
with the drugs,

16:45.269 --> 16:46.802
otherwise this has
all been for nothing.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.337
Take two full units.
No chances.

16:48.405 --> 16:50.839
This is gonna be one hell
of a welcome party for Street.

16:50.908 --> 16:52.107
I'll prep the team.

16:54.411 --> 16:55.677
HONDO:
We're rolling
out in five.

16:55.746 --> 16:58.046
Vandelli's team's
got backup.

17:01.919 --> 17:05.587
Hey. We're not leaving here with
drama hanging over our heads.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.157
Let it out.

17:09.226 --> 17:11.059
Hondo, there's nothing
to let out.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.629
You needed to keep the circle
small to keep Street safe.

17:13.697 --> 17:14.663
It wasn't a
matter of trust,

17:14.732 --> 17:16.999
it was a matter of mistakes.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.067
If we didn't know anything,
we couldn't make any.

17:21.705 --> 17:22.704
Be real with me.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.045
I get why we couldn't know.
At first.

17:30.114 --> 17:32.281
But I don't see how keeping us
in the dark for two weeks

17:32.349 --> 17:34.049
after he quit
kept Street any safer.

17:34.118 --> 17:35.584
We had to follow
strict orders.

17:35.653 --> 17:38.220
And the second we got the
chance to let you in, we did.

17:38.289 --> 17:41.156
Yeah, after two weeks of feeling
guilty and blaming ourselves.

17:41.225 --> 17:43.191
Chris, trust me,
it was not easy

17:43.260 --> 17:45.193
to stand by
and not say anything to you.

17:45.262 --> 17:48.063
But the integrity of the mission
had to come first.
I know.

17:48.132 --> 17:49.498
And we're not
blaming you, Hondo.

17:49.566 --> 17:51.767
It's just been really tough.

17:55.306 --> 17:57.105
Well, let's make sure
today's better.

18:04.815 --> 18:07.582
(door opens, closes)

18:07.651 --> 18:09.418
Nate?

18:09.486 --> 18:12.120
Where were you? I thought we
were hanging here tonight.

18:12.189 --> 18:14.589
I need you to pack your things
and get out of here right now.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.259
Didn't you just get done telling
me that we couldn't bail?

18:17.328 --> 18:19.261
Not us. You.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.229
You went back to the bar,
didn't you?

18:21.298 --> 18:22.864
I told you not to go.
Listen, listen.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.900
Something big
is about to go down

18:24.968 --> 18:26.802
and I need you clear of it.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.037
Look, whatever you got yourself
into, you can't handle alone.

18:29.106 --> 18:30.472
We're not letting
each other go again.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.374
This is different.
How?

18:32.443 --> 18:36.478
I can't explain,
I just need you to trust me.

18:36.547 --> 18:39.381
Remember the Robin Motel?
That crappy place off Spring?

18:39.450 --> 18:42.217
Yeah. 40 bucks a night, didn't
even have an ice machine.

18:42.286 --> 18:44.453
Go there, lay low for a few days
till I call you.

18:44.521 --> 18:46.088
Do not let anyone know
you're there.

18:46.156 --> 18:48.123
What aren't you telling me?

18:48.192 --> 18:50.058
Please just go there.

18:50.127 --> 18:51.893
The Robin Motel, then.
Yeah.

18:51.962 --> 18:56.164
Look, whatever's going on,
you know I got your back.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.233
Always have.

19:00.904 --> 19:02.871
Hurry.

19:14.585 --> 19:16.952
HONDO:
I got eyes on the Malaysia ship.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.186
A skeleton crew is moving
specific cargo.

19:18.255 --> 19:19.821
You got them, Chris?

19:19.890 --> 19:22.324
They're taking them across
the port to a warehouse.

19:26.864 --> 19:28.530
They're opening the cargo.

19:28.599 --> 19:29.765
They got protection, too.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.867
Count 20 workers, five guards.

19:37.374 --> 19:38.840
Anyone got eyes on Street?

19:48.218 --> 19:49.518
Street just pulled in.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.386
He's with Nolan.

19:51.455 --> 19:52.554
No sign of Ludlow.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.356
30-David. In position.

19:54.425 --> 19:56.124
Nobody moves until we got
Ludlow in our sights.

19:56.193 --> 19:57.726
What are you looking at?

19:57.795 --> 19:59.661
Just checking for anything
that doesn't feel right.

19:59.730 --> 20:01.630
Occupational hazard.

20:01.698 --> 20:03.465
We don't touch the boxes.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.036
I see your game, Street.

20:09.473 --> 20:12.507
Barging in,
putting on a show for Ludlow?

20:12.576 --> 20:15.110
You're making a play
for my whole operation.

20:17.481 --> 20:18.847
Something's happening
between Street and Nolan.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.682
We can't move until
we see Ludlow.

20:20.751 --> 20:22.751
I don't want your job, Nolan.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.253
All I want is for this
to be finished.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.422
Why don't I believe you?
I don't know.

20:27.491 --> 20:28.990
That's your problem.
Don't forget,

20:29.059 --> 20:32.928
as long as I have
that videotape, your life

20:32.996 --> 20:35.530
and Nate's
life are mine.

20:35.599 --> 20:39.367
You cross me, I will finish you.

20:39.436 --> 20:41.803
And every person you love.

20:48.846 --> 20:50.779
Any issues?
It's all here.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.116
That's the signal.
Ludlow's there.

20:55.185 --> 20:56.084
30-David is set.

20:56.153 --> 20:57.352
Move, move, move!

21:02.092 --> 21:03.859
LAPD!
Police!

21:03.927 --> 21:05.393
LAPD SWAT!
On your knees!
Drop the weapons!

21:05.462 --> 21:07.529
On the ground!
On your knees!
Put the guns down!

21:07.598 --> 21:10.031
The whole time?
Now you know where
you can stick that video.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.034
Hey-hey-hey-hey.
Don't be stupid.

21:13.103 --> 21:14.669
This is not a problem.

21:18.308 --> 21:20.141
You want to tell us
what's in the boxes?

21:20.210 --> 21:21.977
Just a bunch of pigs.

21:34.491 --> 21:36.591
They're empty.
LUDLOW: You're not gonna
find anything.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.660
I'm a legitimate businessman.

21:38.729 --> 21:40.629
There's no drugs.
There's nothing here.

21:40.697 --> 21:42.397
Guess you made
a big mistake, Street.

21:53.410 --> 21:55.043
Get them out of here.
Nice knowing you.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.273
Sir, the drugs were supposed
to be there.

22:06.341 --> 22:07.507
There's no way
they were just playing us.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.175
Why not? We were
playing them.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.577
Maybe they
figured out somehow

22:10.646 --> 22:13.013
that Street was undercover, and
they set us up to flush him out.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.714
If that were true, he wouldn't
be sitting here right now.

22:14.783 --> 22:17.517
Can we keep Ludlow in custody
until we figure this out?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.619
With no drugs, lawyer
just got Ludlow released,

22:19.688 --> 22:20.754
along with his entire crew.

22:20.822 --> 22:22.589
How is this happening?

22:22.658 --> 22:24.558
Everyone has a paper trail with
the company. They're all legit.

22:24.626 --> 22:27.060
Even the gunmen
are cargo security detail.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.595
Five armed guys guarding
a shipment of piggy banks?

22:28.664 --> 22:29.896
Come on, Commander.

22:29.965 --> 22:31.565
Without any heroin,
Ludlow has all the deniability

22:31.633 --> 22:32.866
he needs, legally.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.569
Nolan told Ludlow,
"It's all here."

22:35.637 --> 22:37.537
That had to have been
the shipment.
Then where are the drugs?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.905
I don't know, but we must
have missed something.

22:38.974 --> 22:40.941
Our warrant's good
for 24 hours, right?

22:41.009 --> 22:42.542
Okay, so we roll back
to that warehouse,

22:42.611 --> 22:43.810
and we look for
anything that we missed.

22:43.879 --> 22:46.146
Okay. I'll call Narcotics.

22:46.214 --> 22:48.448
Time to grab up as many dealers
as we can.

22:48.517 --> 22:50.317
Try to get something
out of this mess.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.789
Hey, Street.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.225
Welcome back.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.704
Is that my
mission report?

23:13.075 --> 23:14.975
Sounds like hell.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.411
Yeah, it was.

23:20.182 --> 23:23.183
The entire time you were gone,
I kept blaming myself.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.186
Felt like I should have
stopped you from going down

23:26.254 --> 23:27.520
to Long Beach alone.

23:27.589 --> 23:30.657
If it means anything,

23:30.726 --> 23:32.926
I really appreciate
how much you cared.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.494
It doesn't.

23:35.430 --> 23:36.630
You could have told me.

23:36.698 --> 23:38.698
Chris, I had orders.

23:38.767 --> 23:40.433
I don't care.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.868
And I know
it's not your fault,

23:41.937 --> 23:43.336
and I know it's not
Hondo's fault,

23:43.405 --> 23:45.972
but... it still hurts.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.441
Being lied to this whole time,
when I...

23:48.510 --> 23:49.876
when I was so worried
about you.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.544
I'm sorry. I just--

23:51.613 --> 23:54.114
I mean, I was in an
impossible situation.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.183
But you know now, so
can't we just go back

23:57.252 --> 23:58.618
to how it was before?

23:58.687 --> 24:01.287
I don't know.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.922
Not right now, at least.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.962
(phone vibrating)

24:11.633 --> 24:13.633
Nate, why are you calling?

24:13.702 --> 24:14.968
I heard what went down.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.536
Nolan keeps texting me.

24:16.605 --> 24:17.904
You safe?
Yeah.

24:17.973 --> 24:19.239
You didn't really
quit SWAT, did you?

24:19.307 --> 24:21.641
(sighs)
No, but our bust went bad.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.243
There were no drugs.

24:23.311 --> 24:25.912
We had to let Ludlow
and Nolan walk.
What are we gonna do?

24:25.981 --> 24:28.782
We can't leave Nolan out there,
wanting us dead.

24:29.918 --> 24:33.486
Wait... I know something
you can use.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.921
Maybe. I know where to look.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.656
No, no, no. Stay put.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.091
Don't let anyone know
where you are.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.727
I will come to you, you tell me
what to look for and where.

24:40.796 --> 24:42.095
Just get here.

24:42.164 --> 24:43.229
I'm at our spot.

24:43.298 --> 24:45.165
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

24:50.172 --> 24:52.439
Street was sure the
drugs were coming here.

24:52.507 --> 24:54.107
Well, just in case,
I got Chris and Tan

24:54.176 --> 24:56.009
paying a visit
to Ludlow's corporate office.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.911
See if anything turns up.

24:59.147 --> 25:01.548
Deacon... are they
doing all right?

25:01.616 --> 25:04.017
Yeah. Best they can,
considering the whiplash.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.418
But they're tough.

25:05.487 --> 25:07.087
The team still feels
out of sync.

25:07.155 --> 25:10.056
Maybe I could have
done it different...
Hey, no-no.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.025
That "what if" game,
that's just a fool's errand.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.993
Doesn't mean the
call wasn't bad.

25:14.062 --> 25:15.228
We stand by
your decisions.

25:15.297 --> 25:17.263
That's what a good team does.
That's how they endure,

25:17.332 --> 25:18.598
get through times like this.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.533
You start doubting yourself,

25:20.602 --> 25:22.035
it's gonna make us
doubt each other.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.147
I thought maybe the banks
themselves were made of heroin,

25:34.216 --> 25:36.416
but so far, nothing.

25:36.485 --> 25:37.817
I'll keep testing,

25:37.886 --> 25:39.719
but don't
get your hopes up.

25:43.024 --> 25:44.557
That glove over there...

25:45.494 --> 25:46.659
Is that one of yours?
No.

25:46.728 --> 25:48.595
Must have come off
one of the dock workers.

25:48.663 --> 25:49.963
You mind?

25:52.734 --> 25:53.733
The guys unpacking
the piggy banks,

25:53.802 --> 25:54.801
they weren't wearing gloves.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.806
The guys carrying
the boxes were.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.042
Do me a favor.
Test that.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.420
Positive.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.990
Wait a second. Street said
that Nolan wouldn't let him

26:17.058 --> 26:18.258
touch the boxes.

26:25.534 --> 26:26.766
The boxes weren't carrying
the heroin, the boxes

26:26.835 --> 26:28.701
<i> are</i> the heroin.
It's baked in the cardboard.

26:32.774 --> 26:34.774
Dumpsters are empty.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.042
Boxes are gone.

26:36.111 --> 26:37.644
Trash crew came
this morning.

26:37.712 --> 26:39.479
The unis let them
empty the bins.

26:39.548 --> 26:41.047
That wasn't
the trash crew.

26:41.116 --> 26:43.249
Ludlow just got
all his heroin back.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.220
HAWXHURST:
<i> The process is more simple</i>
<i> than you might think.</i>

26:47.289 --> 26:50.156
Powdered heroin is mixed
with a solvent

26:50.225 --> 26:51.624
to turn it into a liquid.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.561
The box soaks it up
like a sponge.

26:54.629 --> 26:57.330
Once it dries, it's
basically indistinguishable

26:57.399 --> 26:58.998
from a box you might get
from Amazon.

26:59.067 --> 27:00.667
He can switch up
the cargo every time.

27:00.735 --> 27:03.136
Long as Ludlow knows
which boat the boxes are on,

27:03.205 --> 27:05.071
he's all set.
How do they
extract the heroin

27:05.140 --> 27:06.840
from the boxes
once they get here?

27:06.908 --> 27:09.709
HAWXHURST:
By washing the cardboard
with the same solvent.

27:09.778 --> 27:13.046
The chemical separates
the heroin from the cardboard.

27:13.114 --> 27:14.347
Gravity does the rest.

27:14.416 --> 27:15.715
TAN:
And the heroin's in that soup?

27:15.784 --> 27:17.851
Yes, but it's still mixed
with other chemicals.

27:17.919 --> 27:21.821
We have to use heat to
separate out the impurities.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.591
This fume hood is
keeping the gas inside,

27:24.659 --> 27:26.192
but it is deadly to breathe.

27:26.261 --> 27:28.027
And if we heat
it up too much

27:28.096 --> 27:30.563
or too fast, the
heroin will burn

27:30.632 --> 27:32.966
and the smoke will
get much worse.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.771
And here's what
we're left with.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.342
100% pure heroin.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.611
Ludlow gets thousands of boxes;
there's no way

27:44.679 --> 27:46.512
he's going through this process
one at a time.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.549
No. It would take a sizable lab
to process this at high volume.

27:49.618 --> 27:53.019
Patrol rolled by Ludlow's estate
to pick him up, he wasn't there.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.587
Warrant's out,
but he's in the wind.

27:54.656 --> 27:55.722
Well, he's not skipping town
with a truck

27:55.790 --> 27:56.823
full of cardboard boxes.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.091
We got to find out where
he's processing this,

27:58.159 --> 28:00.293
and fast.

28:10.005 --> 28:12.438
(phone ringing nearby)

28:13.842 --> 28:15.842
(ringing continues)

28:20.649 --> 28:23.483
Nate? You in there?

28:29.624 --> 28:31.291
Nate?

28:46.241 --> 28:47.340
Street, we found
Ludlow's drugs.

28:47.409 --> 28:48.975
We know his game. He's
not gonna get away.

28:49.044 --> 28:51.011
This wasn't Ludlow.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.348
I found these...
in the ironing board,

28:55.417 --> 28:56.983
between the cloth and the metal.

28:57.052 --> 28:59.986
You know,
in a-a foster home,

29:00.055 --> 29:02.322
there's so little
that's actually yours.

29:02.391 --> 29:04.458
New kids always
nabbing your stuff.

29:05.727 --> 29:07.494
Ironing board was one
of Nate's hiding places.

29:07.563 --> 29:08.995
He knew I'd look there.

29:09.064 --> 29:11.064
Those are papers

29:11.133 --> 29:12.532
from Nolan's office.

29:12.601 --> 29:14.367
Nate must have ignored me

29:14.436 --> 29:16.169
and-and gone
after him on his own

29:16.238 --> 29:17.871
to find him,
and-and then Nolan,

29:17.940 --> 29:19.873
or his-his guys
followed him back here.

29:19.942 --> 29:21.007
What do the papers say?

29:21.076 --> 29:22.442
I don't know what
to make of them,

29:22.511 --> 29:24.110
but they-they got
to mean something.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.880
Nate died getting them to us,
so we're gonna dig through them.

29:26.949 --> 29:29.516
You know Nolan's
behind this, right?

29:29.585 --> 29:31.685
He's-he's punishing
me for burning him.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.053
We don't have proof yet
Nolan was here.

29:33.121 --> 29:34.387
I believe you.

29:34.456 --> 29:35.922
But SWAT's priority is Ludlow.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.859
We'll put Homicide on this;
they will get him.

29:38.927 --> 29:39.960
HICKS: Right now
we need to find

29:40.028 --> 29:42.095
Ludlow's lab and shut it down.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.867
I want to see him out.
HICKS: Of course.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.975
All right, I'm gonna
bring these back to HQ.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.743
I'm gonna
take Street with me.

29:56.812 --> 29:58.512
Keep an eye on him
until he settles down.

30:01.316 --> 30:03.550
Maybe I should stay
here with Homicide.

30:03.619 --> 30:04.885
I understand
Ludlow's our priority,

30:04.953 --> 30:06.119
but we got to get to Nolan

30:06.188 --> 30:07.287
before he adds
to his body count.

30:07.356 --> 30:08.755
Check the street cams.

30:08.824 --> 30:11.892
There's got to be a shot of
Nolan or his guys coming here.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.293
Street's gone.

30:13.362 --> 30:17.063
He didn't ride with Nate's body.
I found this on his motorcycle.

30:17.132 --> 30:19.099
Nate's car's gone, too.
He's going after Nolan.

30:19.167 --> 30:20.567
Go. I'll find that footage.

30:20.636 --> 30:21.968
What about Ludlow?
We'll grab him up.

30:22.037 --> 30:24.905
Hondo, find Nolan
before Street does.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.407
These are just bar receipts.

30:27.476 --> 30:28.775
Nothing out of the ordinary.

30:28.844 --> 30:30.243
There has to be something here.

30:30.312 --> 30:31.778
Nate told Street
he had something we can use.

30:31.847 --> 30:33.079
Hey, check this out.

30:33.148 --> 30:34.781
Supply bill
from a Cavalier Corp.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.951
Ten grand on bar napkins,
six on coasters, 20 on ice?

30:38.020 --> 30:40.086
Bill's over a hundred
thousand dollars.

30:40.155 --> 30:42.122
Either Nolan's ice guy is
taking him to the cleaners,

30:42.190 --> 30:44.658
or this is not a
real distributor.

30:44.726 --> 30:46.426
I've seen this date
in Street's report.

30:46.495 --> 30:48.261
It's the same day Nolan first
bought heroin from Ludlow.

30:48.330 --> 30:49.629
This is how
he paid for it.

30:49.698 --> 30:51.164
DEACON:
Well, nothing to find
with Cavalier.

30:51.233 --> 30:53.633
No real names. Just
a list of properties.

30:53.702 --> 30:54.868
Hey, hold on.

30:57.005 --> 30:58.705
Cavalier owns a
recycling plant.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.941
TAN:
Looks big enough
to hide a lab.

31:01.009 --> 31:02.375
And Ludlow could order
equipment and chemicals

31:02.444 --> 31:03.643
without raising eyebrows.

31:03.712 --> 31:05.045
This has to
be the place.

31:07.382 --> 31:08.348
(man grunts)

31:08.417 --> 31:10.383
(clinking nearby)

31:12.020 --> 31:13.820
(man groans)

31:13.889 --> 31:15.121
LAPD!

31:15.190 --> 31:16.623
(man groans)
Whoever's back there,

31:16.692 --> 31:18.491
come up, slowly.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
Hands where I can see them.

31:23.899 --> 31:25.131
Where's Nolan?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.767
Put the cuffs on me.
I'm not telling you anything.

31:30.272 --> 31:32.105
Get up. Get up!

31:34.876 --> 31:35.842
What happened to your arm?

31:35.911 --> 31:38.178
Jim Street happened.
You know him?

31:38.246 --> 31:39.746
Did he come up in here
asking about Nolan?

31:39.815 --> 31:41.181
And did you tell him anything?

31:41.249 --> 31:43.883
No. But then he broke
my arm again.

31:43.952 --> 31:45.318
How about we just
cut to the part

31:45.387 --> 31:46.453
where you tell me
everything you told...

31:48.457 --> 31:51.458
I got no problems
breaking your other arm.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.160
(tires screech)

32:09.811 --> 32:11.811
♪ ♪

32:28.964 --> 32:31.531
Nolan inside?

32:31.600 --> 32:35.969
Saw him enter about ten
minutes ago with a pizza.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.805
So what are we waiting on?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.241
Well, I guess I need him
to come back out.

32:41.309 --> 32:43.877
Maybe I approach,
provoke a fight.

32:43.945 --> 32:47.147
Should justify
whatever happens after.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.849
Could have done that when you
saw him ten minutes ago, Street.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.154
(exhales)

32:56.958 --> 32:59.325
Why didn't Nate just...

32:59.394 --> 33:02.662
stay put like I told him to?

33:05.367 --> 33:07.901
He was trying to help you, kid.

33:07.969 --> 33:10.303
He probably thought he owed you
for getting you caught up

33:10.372 --> 33:12.906
in all of this.
I was always the
one that owed him.

33:12.974 --> 33:14.741
Maybe.

33:14.810 --> 33:18.745
But sometimes we all get
a little twisted, man.

33:18.814 --> 33:21.147
I blamed myself every day
you were under.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.616
I made the call
and I felt like everything

33:23.685 --> 33:25.318
you went through was on me.

33:25.387 --> 33:27.687
Nolan has to pay.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.925
The only thing you owe Nate

33:31.993 --> 33:33.927
is to be the great cop
that he saw you as.

33:33.995 --> 33:35.462
That's who he was protecting.

33:35.530 --> 33:38.031
Is that who I really am?
(scoffs)

33:38.100 --> 33:41.034
Street,
are you kidding me?

33:41.103 --> 33:43.036
(chuckles)

33:43.105 --> 33:45.872
When you ditched us
back at that motel,

33:45.941 --> 33:48.174
I felt like every bad decision
I'd ever made

33:48.243 --> 33:51.177
was coming back
to bite me in my ass.

33:51.246 --> 33:54.380
But then I find you
sitting right here,

33:54.449 --> 33:56.382
instead of standing
in that house,

33:56.451 --> 33:58.885
standing over Nolan's dead body.

34:00.021 --> 34:02.288
Street, you are a great cop.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.224
You came to me and Hicks
about your brother Nate

34:04.292 --> 34:06.359
when you could have tried
to handle it on your own.

34:06.428 --> 34:08.061
You sacrificed
your reputation

34:08.130 --> 34:10.997
trying to stop something
that threatened the city.

34:11.066 --> 34:13.967
I know now that I made
the right call putting you in.

34:14.035 --> 34:16.169
And I know that you were
never gonna follow through

34:16.238 --> 34:18.238
with what you think
you came here to do.

34:21.610 --> 34:23.042
You call the cops on me?

34:23.111 --> 34:24.878
I gave Lynch this address.

34:24.946 --> 34:27.313
And she found footage
of Nolan and one of his guys

34:27.382 --> 34:28.581
going to Nate's motel.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.084
We got him, Street.

34:31.153 --> 34:32.919
We got him
for Nate's murder.

34:41.630 --> 34:43.596
You coming with me, Officer?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.200
HONDO:
Teague Nolan, this is the LAPD!

34:47.269 --> 34:49.602
We've got a warrant
for your arrest!

34:49.671 --> 34:51.671
(pounding on door)

35:02.117 --> 35:04.484
Don't move, Nolan!

35:05.754 --> 35:08.188
I should've known
you were a rat.

35:08.256 --> 35:10.890
Drop the bag.
Hands where I can see them.

35:10.959 --> 35:13.560
Kept my promise, though,
didn't I?

35:13.628 --> 35:15.028
How's Nate?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.367
Much as I'd like
to see you go for that gun,

35:21.436 --> 35:23.570
I need you on the ground

35:23.638 --> 35:25.839
with your hands
behind your head now!

35:27.976 --> 35:29.776
I'll shoot you before he does.

35:31.246 --> 35:33.646
Then everybody here wins
but you.

35:36.117 --> 35:37.450
(sighs)

35:45.460 --> 35:47.493
Teague Nolan,

35:47.562 --> 35:50.663
you're under arrest
for the murder of Nate Warren.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.699
(grunts)

36:14.089 --> 36:16.322
Cops are here!
(gunfire)

36:18.493 --> 36:19.692
Go, go, go!

36:19.761 --> 36:21.494
Police! Drop the weapon!

36:22.898 --> 36:24.230
(gunfire in distance)

36:26.234 --> 36:29.002
(whistles)
Hey! We need to move.

36:29.070 --> 36:30.904
Grab every grain
of powder you can.

36:35.510 --> 36:37.977
Forget the trays. The rest
of the cardboard's a wash.

36:38.046 --> 36:39.679
Slow them down.
You got it.

37:01.154 --> 37:02.453
Chris, Tan. Find Ludlow.

37:02.522 --> 37:03.754
We'll take care of this.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.362
(gunshot)

37:13.032 --> 37:14.999
(flames roaring)

37:17.503 --> 37:20.071
We can't let Ludlow get
away with those drugs.

37:36.189 --> 37:37.955
Let's go, let's go.

37:44.097 --> 37:46.330
(gunshots)

37:46.399 --> 37:48.466
Don't move! Hands up!

37:48.534 --> 37:50.468
Don't move, Ludlow!

37:52.305 --> 37:54.638
This is for Jim Street.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.243
(zip tie tightens)

38:02.048 --> 38:03.914
TAN:
We got him.

38:03.983 --> 38:05.549
Ludlow's in custody.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.651
Couldn't have done it
without you.

38:09.389 --> 38:11.288
I'm sorry about Nate.

38:12.759 --> 38:14.825
Yeah. We all know
how much he meant to you.

38:14.894 --> 38:16.460
Street, you need anything,
we're here for you.

38:18.231 --> 38:20.164
I'm just grateful to be
back on the team again.

38:20.233 --> 38:23.267
Street. You never
left this team.

38:29.842 --> 38:31.175
MOLLY:
Jim.

38:32.945 --> 38:35.913
STREET:
Molly.

38:36.949 --> 38:38.015
I...

38:38.084 --> 38:39.884
My dad told me everything.

38:39.952 --> 38:42.019
Why you ghosted me
the past couple weeks,

38:42.088 --> 38:44.688
about your brother.

38:47.126 --> 38:49.827
I'm so sorry.

38:58.805 --> 39:01.105
That mission report's gonna
make good bedtime reading

39:01.174 --> 39:02.606
for the mayor and the chief.

39:02.675 --> 39:05.075
Yeah. Lots of arrests.

39:05.144 --> 39:06.811
We got your guy.

39:06.879 --> 39:09.213
It's a major win
for the department.

39:09.282 --> 39:10.381
And for you.

39:10.450 --> 39:11.982
Then why doesn't it
feel like it?

39:12.051 --> 39:14.618
Because someone innocent
got killed.

39:20.126 --> 39:21.759
Days like this make me
want to steer the wagon

39:21.828 --> 39:24.128
straight into a gulch.
Hey, hey.

39:24.197 --> 39:25.629
Don't talk like that.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.766
I got a ritual of my own,
you know.

39:28.835 --> 39:32.503
A decade back, I negotiated
a hostage situation

39:32.572 --> 39:34.672
for the French consulate.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.906
So every Christmas,

39:35.975 --> 39:38.809
they send me a box of these.

39:38.878 --> 39:40.177
So after every mission,

39:40.246 --> 39:43.247
I allow myself just one.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.352
You shared something with me.

39:48.421 --> 39:49.854
Least I can do
is return the favor.

39:55.528 --> 39:57.528
To Nate Warren.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.564
To Nate.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.441
I should've lied.

40:12.945 --> 40:14.879
To Nate.

40:14.947 --> 40:18.516
I told him we didn't have Nolan,
that we needed evidence.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.217
And he went out looking for it.

40:20.286 --> 40:22.419
Anything you said
wasn't gonna stop him.

40:23.623 --> 40:24.989
And people keep on

40:25.057 --> 40:27.458
telling me that he's a hero

40:27.527 --> 40:32.062
and talking about how brave
he is, calling<i> me</i> brave.

40:32.131 --> 40:34.298
I don't feel very brave.

40:34.367 --> 40:36.066
It doesn't mean you're not.

40:41.607 --> 40:45.543
You know, I used to be
the go-to guy for undercover.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.811
I loved the danger.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.513
I could really push the limit

40:49.582 --> 40:52.716
'cause it didn't matter
what happened to me.

40:52.785 --> 40:55.052
It's probably why
I was so good at it.

40:55.121 --> 40:58.222
Something happened
this time, though.

40:58.291 --> 41:01.225
My hand would shake.

41:01.294 --> 41:05.262
And it wasn't a...
it wasn't my brain.

41:05.331 --> 41:08.666
I knew how to play my part.

41:08.734 --> 41:12.169
My body was trying
to tell me something.

41:12.238 --> 41:14.338
This wasn't an everyday op.
I know.

41:14.407 --> 41:17.975
But the shaking, it only started
when Nolan mentioned Molly.

41:19.478 --> 41:22.212
Two years ago, I had nothing.

41:22.281 --> 41:27.284
And now I-I got this job that
I love and an amazing girlfriend

41:27.353 --> 41:31.455
and... I mean, this team.

41:31.524 --> 41:33.390
It's the family I never had.

41:33.459 --> 41:35.192
And...

41:35.261 --> 41:39.263
yeah, I mean, we've
had our bumps lately,

41:39.332 --> 41:42.066
but Chris...

41:42.134 --> 41:44.802
she's my best friend.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.537
You've come a long way, kid.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.075
My hand was shaking
'cause I realized

41:51.143 --> 41:53.377
I finally had something to lose.
