01:13.741 --> 01:15.409
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.410
MAN:
I just witnessed a hit and run.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.411
FEMALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

01:17.445 --> 01:18.146
WOMAN: My apartment
building's on fire.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.147
There are people still inside!

01:19.180 --> 01:20.848
FEMALE OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

01:20.881 --> 01:21.482
CHILD:
How many people...

01:21.515 --> 01:22.483
WOMAN:
I hear screams!

01:22.516 --> 01:23.151
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.453
I need to get to a hospital.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.820
I'm five months pregnant.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.522
I'm feeling sharp,
stabbing pains.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.658
(gasping)

01:30.691 --> 01:32.426
It's too soon for contractions.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.862
I'm at 249 West McCoy Street.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.833
Hello? Hello?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.170
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.438
I need help.
I need an ambulance.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.840
I think my wife is
having a heart attack.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.676
She's collapsed.
What-what do I do?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.544
Hello?
Are you-- are you there?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.513
Hello! Help!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.282
Honey, sweetheart, stay with me.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.516
Hold on, sweetheart, hold on.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.588
Hello? Hello?
Hello? Hello?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.356
Someone help, please!

02:02.390 --> 02:03.524
I need help!

02:03.557 --> 02:04.858
Help! Help!

02:04.892 --> 02:06.527
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.628
We need an ambulance.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.397
A man's fallen
from a scaffolding,

02:09.430 --> 02:10.831
but we can't tell if he's alive.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.301
There's blood everywhere
and he isn't moving.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.236
Hello? Can you hear me?
Are you there?

02:15.269 --> 02:16.637
Are you there?
Hello, hello?

02:16.670 --> 02:17.638
Sweeney,
hold on.
Can you hear me?

02:17.671 --> 02:18.872
Hello?

02:18.906 --> 02:19.940
It's coming down!

02:19.973 --> 02:22.310
Watch out! Look out!

02:22.343 --> 02:23.844
(shouting)

02:23.877 --> 02:25.679
Go, go!

02:25.713 --> 02:27.248
Something's wrong with my phone!

02:27.281 --> 02:28.882
Someone call 911!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.420
MALE OPERATOR 2:
This is 911.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.621
What is your emergency?

02:33.654 --> 02:34.788
FEMALE OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.390
What is your emergency?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.925
We've been flooded with reports

02:37.958 --> 02:39.927
of people having issues
calling 911 from cell phones.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.861
They say they connect

02:40.894 --> 02:43.331
to an operator, but then
the call drops off

02:43.364 --> 02:44.865
and their phone
freezes in call mode.

02:44.898 --> 02:45.866
What makes you think

02:45.899 --> 02:48.269
that this is a cyber intrusion

02:48.302 --> 02:50.904
and not a malfunction
of the New York City 911 system?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.606
Well, we've checked
and double-checked.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.942
There's no evidence
of a mechanical malfunction.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.944
Our IT guys believe
it's a hack within our system

02:56.977 --> 02:58.946
that affects
incoming cell phone calls.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.281
Anyone who places a call
from a land line

03:00.314 --> 03:01.915
doesn't experience the problem.

03:01.949 --> 03:05.653
Have you ruled out issues
with cell service providers?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.954
They've all confirmed
that cell towers in the city

03:06.987 --> 03:07.955
are properly functioning

03:07.988 --> 03:10.824
and all other wireless
phone traffic is normal.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.993
So it only happens
when someone calls 911?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.829
When someone calls 911
from a cell phone.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.431
Not getting help
when you want it?

03:17.465 --> 03:18.899
That's terrifying.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.969
RYAN: The mayor and
Homeland Security are concerned

03:22.002 --> 03:23.837
that this could be
a well-crafted precursor

03:23.871 --> 03:26.006
to a terrorist attack.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.975
Raven says the first reports
of dropped 911 calls

03:28.008 --> 03:29.643
came in around
7:00 a.m. this morning.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.011
Complaints were made
to local precincts

03:31.044 --> 03:32.546
and cell service providers.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.548
My operators noticed
a decrease in call volume

03:34.582 --> 03:35.549
about the same time.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.684
But none have reported

03:36.717 --> 03:37.951
being abruptly disconnected

03:37.985 --> 03:38.986
or dropped from a call.

03:39.019 --> 03:39.820
OPERATOR:
Excuse me, Clayton?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.555
Sorry. Will you
excuse me a moment?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.893
RAVEN:
According to my stats, there's
definitely something going on.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.861
Well, I've compared
the number of 911 calls

03:47.895 --> 03:49.597
from yesterday at this hour

03:49.630 --> 03:50.864
to those received this morning.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.933
Huge decrease
in cell phone calls.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.702
On a typical day,
the call center

03:54.735 --> 03:55.969
would get 24,000 calls,

03:56.003 --> 03:57.638
70% from cell phones.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.608
And this morning,
cellular calls went down to 30%.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.910
RUSSELL: So there are
some cell phones out there

04:02.943 --> 04:05.846
that are connecting to 911
and completing the call.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.015
Right?
Yeah, but the strange thing is,

04:08.048 --> 04:10.017
is that most
of the calls are made

04:10.050 --> 04:12.620
from devices outside
of Manhattan, in the Boroughs.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.054
KRUMITZ: We plugged
into the 911 system.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.056
No evidence of malfunctions

04:16.089 --> 04:17.525
or indicators of compromise.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.059
Yeah, no known vulnerability,
no malware,

04:19.092 --> 04:20.894
not a trace of digital dust
that indicates a hack.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.963
I mean, these boxes
are squeaky clean.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.333
So there's nothing here that
can tell us what's going on.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.700
Okay, so that means

04:26.734 --> 04:29.670
the problem has to be
internal to the cell phones.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.971
They're all different
models and brands,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.606
in different locations
all over the city.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.375
Not to mention
that they all have

04:34.408 --> 04:35.743
different service providers.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.010
Other than them being
cell phones, I mean,

04:37.044 --> 04:38.379
they have no connection
to each other.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.348
RUSSELL:
Yeah, except they all

04:40.381 --> 04:42.049
dropped 911 calls, right?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.852
We need to get ahold
of one of those phones.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.354
I might be able
to help with you that.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.055
I have the latest
incident reports.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.723
There was an accident
at a construction site

04:49.757 --> 04:51.359
not far from here.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.826
The foreman called
for paramedics.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.428
Same thing happened.
Dropped call.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.397
There's a possibility
we can get that phone.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.368
*

05:01.969 --> 05:04.071
FOREMAN:
Yeah, that's my cell number

05:04.104 --> 05:05.606
and I'm the site foreman.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.511
I called 911 when
the scaffolding collapsed.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.947
Sweeney dropped
from the third floor.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.916
And there were two others
who also dialed 911?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.951
Yeah, Henderson and Joe Lavelle.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.787
Just like me,
they reached the operator,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.356
and then the phones froze
and nobody was on the other end.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.924
Is there a way
to get in touch with them?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.058
I'd like to take a look
at their devices.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.960
Yeah, I can, uh,

05:26.994 --> 05:29.463
I can get you
their home number.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.664
This is crazy.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.999
That kid was only
20 years old.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.401
Bled to death because I couldn't

05:33.434 --> 05:34.968
get the paramedics here in time.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.570
And now, two more of my guys

05:36.604 --> 05:37.938
are in the hospital
in critical condition.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.808
I hope you can figure this out.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.843
You know,
on jobs like this,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.579
something happens every day
on these sites.

05:45.613 --> 05:49.082
I need to know that my guys
can get help when they need it.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.083
Excuse me.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.119
(indistinct chatter)

05:58.992 --> 06:00.961
NELSON: Eric O'Brian's phone
is infected with malware.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.497
I mean, it's gonna take time
to reverse-engineer the code

06:03.531 --> 06:05.599
and figure out exactly
what it does to a cell.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.667
Nah, forget the code.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.969
I cloned his device
to a known-good test phone.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.071
Let's just call 911
and see what happens.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.173
All right.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.075
MALE OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.410
My name is
Daniel Krumitz.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.845
I'm an agent
with the FBI.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.613
Operator, if you
wouldn't mind

06:19.647 --> 06:21.749
standing up and
waving for me?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.617
911. What is
your emergency?

06:23.651 --> 06:25.118
How 'bout counting to ten?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.987
Hello? You there?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.188
Nope. Okay.
Already gone.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.923
That lasted about
three seconds.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.593
Hey, look, maybe he thought you
were a prank caller and hung up.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.495
You know, you don't exactly
sound like an FBI agent.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.064
An operator isn't gonna
hang up that quickly.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.199
They're required to make sure
there's no real emergency,

06:39.232 --> 06:40.734
regardless of what
the caller says.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.736
So maybe you didn't reach
an operator at all.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.072
Remember, operators haven't been
reporting dropped calls,

06:45.105 --> 06:46.974
only people dialing
in on cell phones have.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.008
Hmm.

06:49.910 --> 06:50.911
This test phone's
still active.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.482
It's frozen;
I'm locked out.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.916
That's the hacker's plan.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.117
When you attempt
to dial 911,

06:57.150 --> 06:58.452
you won't get a chance
to do it again.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.787
Or use a cell at all.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.689
It'll force you to find
a land line or a pay phone.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.422
A pay phone?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.857
And who uses
a land line anymore?

07:03.891 --> 07:05.058
Yeah.
I don't even have one
in my apartment.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.894
I don't have one, either.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.161
Oh, look.
Krummy, check this, right?

07:08.195 --> 07:10.197
I got a timestamp
indicating the moment

07:10.230 --> 07:12.633
the malware infected
Eric O'Brian's phone, right?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.902
And just seconds
before that,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.505
his cell phone connected
to a Wi-Fi network.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.672
So that router
could be

07:18.706 --> 07:20.107
the source of the infection.
Mm-hmm.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.208
You got a location?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.142
Yeah.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.244
Two seconds.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.879
And... tah-dah.

07:25.913 --> 07:26.914
All right, I got it.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.848
I'm driving.
Let's go.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.217
What exactly does
an FBI agent sound like?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.753
Smooth, Krummy. Sturdy.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.087
Gotta sound like you just
finished the Ironman.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.156
I'm out of breath?
No, man.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.891
You gotta be tough.
You know, like a...

07:37.925 --> 07:39.159
like a bad-ass.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.061
(tough voice):
Daniel Krumitz, FBI.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.697
(deeper voice):
Dan... Daniel Krumitz, FBI.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.199
(indistinct chatter)

07:49.737 --> 07:52.105
The router that Eric's phone
connected to isn't here.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.876
MUNDO: You're sure you got
the right location?
NELSON: I'm positive.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.011
Well, maybe our hacker
removed the device.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.947
Wanted it to remain undetected.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
Wait, wait, guys,
it just showed up.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.884
And... now it's gone.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
That means it's moving.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.187
Wait, guys,
it's back up again.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.889
Signal's getting stronger.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.791
Real strong.
WOMAN: Is it coming?

08:10.824 --> 08:11.859
WOMAN 2:
Oh, thank you.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.964
That's it, right there.
That's why the signal's moving.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.700
Free Wi-Fi. Stop that bus!
I'll call Avery and D.B.!

08:26.039 --> 08:28.041
Let's see what's
on the bus's router.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.314
Okay, same malware on
Eric O'Brian's phone.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.317
But... that's not
the interesting part.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.185
Nelson.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.220
No. Uh-uh.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.889
It... it can't be.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.723
I know, right?

08:42.756 --> 08:43.924
But it is, though, look.
Guys, guys.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
Hey, hey. Can we use words

08:45.192 --> 08:46.326
that actually mean something?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.595
(laughs)

08:47.628 --> 08:48.729
KRUMITZ:
It's like this, okay?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.831
I have the flu. I sneeze.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.165
If you're close enough to me,

08:52.199 --> 08:53.233
you get the flu.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.334
That's what this is.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.236
It's an airborne computer virus.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.872
It... it lives.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.173
What do you mean,
"it lives," Krumitz?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.241
NELSON:
It was programmed to spread

09:01.274 --> 09:03.210
like a real virus.
It jumps from unsecured router

09:03.243 --> 09:04.578
to unsecured router
within 150 feet.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.280
So it infects
any wireless access point

09:07.314 --> 09:08.749
that's not password protected?

09:08.782 --> 09:09.683
And even the ones that use

09:09.717 --> 09:11.151
a default password
from the manufacturer.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.753
So this bus has been, like,

09:12.786 --> 09:14.354
"sneezing" all over town.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.692
Every unsecured router
in its path has been infected?

09:18.726 --> 09:22.295
KRUMITZ: And whenever
a Wi-Fi enabled phone connects

09:22.329 --> 09:24.698
to one of these infected
routers, it gets the virus.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.334
Malware automatically
jumps onto it.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.936
RYAN:
It's contagious.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.103
I've never seen anything

09:30.137 --> 09:31.138
in the wild
like this before.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.206
Can the virus jump
from phone to phone?
No.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.942
Phones can only
get the virus

09:34.975 --> 09:36.610
if they're connected to
one of the infected routers.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.280
Well, at least these buses
stay on the same route, right?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.249
It'll help us
contain the infection.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.651
RYAN: But ultimately,
all the buses

09:43.684 --> 09:44.918
go back to home base.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.788
And then this infection jumps
from bus router to bus router.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.356
And then bright
and early this morning,

09:49.389 --> 09:52.225
all those buses went right back
into the streets of Manhattan.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.861
Increasing the number of people

09:53.894 --> 09:56.029
who won't get any help
when they call 911.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.297
This is an outbreak.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.066
We're looking
at an epidemic.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.635
We need to find patient zero.

10:11.311 --> 10:17.651
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

10:19.352 --> 10:25.926
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

10:25.959 --> 10:29.262
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:29.296 --> 10:33.300
* I can see for miles
and miles *

10:33.333 --> 10:37.370
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:37.404 --> 10:41.141
* And miles...

10:41.174 --> 10:43.811
* Oh, yeah.

11:01.394 --> 11:05.332
The infected area has grown
by 25% in the past two hours.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.201
I've notified Port Authority
and service providers.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.203
All public routers
are being disconnected

11:10.237 --> 11:11.872
from buses and ferries.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.742
Have FBI communications
get in touch

11:14.775 --> 11:17.077
with all of the New Jersey,
Connecticut,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.112
Philadelphia news media outlets.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.080
Make sure they're
getting the word out

11:20.113 --> 11:22.282
that commuters should
turn off their Wi-Fi

11:22.315 --> 11:23.951
and not try to connect

11:23.984 --> 11:25.953
to any free or open
Wi-Fi sources.

11:25.986 --> 11:30.123
And remind them: use their
landlines when calling 911.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.459
This virus will definitely
cross state lines

11:32.492 --> 11:34.327
unless we're overly cautious.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.297
Yep, a virus warning is already
spreading through social media,

11:37.330 --> 11:39.166
and there's been a big surge

11:39.199 --> 11:41.201
in purchases
of old-school telephones.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.402
You're finally in style, D.B.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.471
(chuckles)

11:44.504 --> 11:46.940
Thanks very much.
Oh, hey, hold on a second.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.509
Little, uh, social protocol.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.112
Let's say you get a text

11:52.145 --> 11:54.447
clearly meant for somebody else,
sent by someone you don't know.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.784
Now, are you supposed
to, uh, text 'em right back

11:56.817 --> 11:58.351
and say they got
the wrong person?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.288
Kind of sounds like
a personal text then.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.356
Well, yeah, kind of.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.326
Wh-Why would you
just assume that?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.195
'Cause if it was something like
"I'm gonna be late"

12:08.228 --> 12:10.864
or "Call me,"
then it's easy to text back.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.265
You wouldn't give it
a second thought.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.234
But if suddenly
you get dropped

12:14.267 --> 12:16.403
into the middle
of someone else's drama...

12:16.436 --> 12:18.238
What did the text say?

12:18.271 --> 12:19.539
Well, uh, none of your business.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.474
(gasps)
You answered my question.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.375
I'll see you later.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.077
Come on, D.B.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.412
It's got to be
pretty juicy, huh?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.414
We'll talk about it
when I get back to DC.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.816
D.B., you can't just...

12:28.849 --> 12:30.417
(scoffs)

12:30.450 --> 12:31.484
Mayor Cavanaugh,
there's no evidence

12:31.518 --> 12:34.454
to suggest that the 911 hack
is a terrorist threat.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.256
Well, that's a relief.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.158
Do you know who's behind it?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.227
We have a profile of
who we're looking for.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.229
They're not part of a
politically motivated

12:42.262 --> 12:44.131
group or collective.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.799
They would have already
claimed responsibility by now.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.801
Our target is an individual

12:47.835 --> 12:50.804
who's celebrating his
power to cripple the city.

12:50.838 --> 12:54.808
He enjoys making people
feel desperate, helpless.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.477
There's a chance that he's tried
something like this in the past

12:57.510 --> 12:59.479
on a smaller scale.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.314
But this virus is an escalation.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.483
He?
It's most likely a man.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.486
Women go about things like this
in a less conspicuous way.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.321
I was told you have a plan.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.991
The malware is mimicking
a biological virus,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.492
so we're using CDC protocol.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.061
We've identified how
it's transmitted,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.063
we've begun the containment,

13:16.096 --> 13:17.530
we're informing the public.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.400
My team is writing code,
an antidote,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.302
that will cure all
the infected phones

13:22.335 --> 13:25.205
and stop any new phones
from acquiring it.

13:25.238 --> 13:29.509
You are, Deputy Director Ryan,
as impressive as I was told.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.445
Which makes my next request
a little uncomfortable.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.216
(sighs)

13:37.517 --> 13:39.452
Brody Nelson.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.454
He's one of my
cyber investigators.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.389
He's also the young man

13:42.422 --> 13:44.391
that hacked into
the New York Stock Exchange,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.259
created havoc
in the financial district.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.928
And I understand
that that tarnished

13:47.961 --> 13:50.130
your first term
in the mayor's office.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.398
This is not about me.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.233
I am well aware
of Brody Nelson's crimes.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.301
He is serving his time.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.603
I would prefer he were in prison
and not writing code

13:56.636 --> 13:58.338
for anything having
to do with my city.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.840
Well, that is not
your call, sir.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.578
Did you know that
eight-million-dollar transfer

14:05.612 --> 14:09.049
as a result of his financial
hack was never accounted for?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.151
That young man knows
where it is.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.995
The mayor's just bent out of
shape because their election's

14:22.029 --> 14:23.163
coming up.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.465
(sighs)
I did a terrible thing, D.B.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.167
Can't expect people to forget.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.272
You know what?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.606
I'm just gonna
image these devices

14:33.640 --> 14:34.674
and go back to DC with you.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.643
It'll be easier
for me to analyze

14:36.676 --> 14:40.247
the malware from Tear Down
and work on the antidote.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.017
Okay.
All right?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.594
Let me make this clear.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.564
I don't want Brody Nelson
working this case.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.233
If Brody Nelson doesn't work on
this case, then neither do I.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.368
So you let me know.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.108
REPORTER: The FBI has informed
us of a malware virus

15:08.141 --> 15:10.043
affecting the 911
emergency system.
...Wi-Fi has been discontinued.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.611
We ask that you use
a landline for all...

15:11.644 --> 15:12.712
OPERATOR:
911, what's your emergency?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.547
This is an emergency.
Excuse me, I
need to make...

15:25.658 --> 15:27.627
What you got?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.662
I've infected these test phones
with the virus.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.498
It lies dormant
until you dial 911,

15:31.531 --> 15:32.665
and this is what you hear.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.701
MALE VOICE: 911.
What is your emergency?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.971
Hello. Hello.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.306
No one there.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.308
That's because there was
never anyone there.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.709
It's a recorded voice.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.512
There's an audio file
hard-coded into the virus.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.546
Now, these phone calls
never make it

15:46.579 --> 15:47.714
to an actual 911 operator.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.249
Just a recorded voice.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.985
The hacker hijacked 911

15:52.019 --> 15:54.554
and made the caller believe
they were getting through.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.323
Mm-hmm, and not only that.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.991
Check this out.
(hums)

15:58.025 --> 16:00.060
MALE VOICE: 911.
What is your emergency?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.395
Say something.
Keep talking.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.065
Hello, this is D.B. Russell.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.500
Testing, one, two, three.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.403
The phone is not frozen, it's
recording everything I'm saying.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.504
Right.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.640
All right, so our
target is a man

16:13.673 --> 16:15.575
who... who gets
off on hearing

16:15.608 --> 16:17.577
the fear and the panic
of helpless people.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.581
He's recording the callers and
sending the audio... somewhere.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.683
And we don't know where?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.152
Nope.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.487
The files are bouncing
through proxy IPs.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.655
It's a dead end.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.358
(classical music plays)

16:42.369 --> 16:43.803
MALE VOICE: 911.
What is your emergency?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.206
WOMAN: Please help, someone
just broke into my house.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.540
He's strangling my husband.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.675
I'm hiding in the closet.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.210
Oh... oh, God. He's...

16:50.243 --> 16:51.544
MALE VOICE:
Try to stay calm, ma'am.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.646
I'm showing your address
is 754 Plymouth Way.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.182
Is that correct?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.516
WOMAN:
Yes, please hurry.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.185
I-I can hear him in the kitchen.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
(crying):
I think my husband's dead.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.521
MALE VOICE:
Help is on the way.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.590
WOMAN: Please hurry.
Where are you?

17:03.623 --> 17:04.757
Am I right or am I right?

17:04.791 --> 17:07.760
The voice of the 911 operator
embedded in the malware

17:07.794 --> 17:09.829
sounds like a long-lost
relative of T-Pain.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.764
Who Pain?
RAMIREZ: T-Pain.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.733
He's the king
of auto-tune.
Yeah.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.068
And that is again?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.736
It's, like,
when a recording artist

17:16.769 --> 17:19.072
alters the pitch of their voice
when they sing off-key.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.141
Or when they suck.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.809
Well, if that's true and
the voice was distorted,

17:22.842 --> 17:24.077
then we should be able
to un-distort it.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.313
I just made that word up. All
right, let's get to work here.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.380
Play it again, Nelson.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.649
All right.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.318
MALE VOICE (slowly): 911.
What is your emer...

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
Okay, Raven, isolate

17:33.186 --> 17:34.787
one of the ringing phones
in the background there.

17:34.821 --> 17:38.091
And pull up the ringtone used
by the 911 call center.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.426
That'll be our baseline.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.694
Right, once we match
the ringtones,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.863
we'll have the real voice
of our 911 operator.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.299
Exactly.
Okay, I am adjusting

17:46.333 --> 17:48.301
the pitch and speed
of the recording

17:48.335 --> 17:49.802
until the waveforms line up.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.605
MALE VOICE: 911.
What is your emergency?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.842
Okay, here we have our real
911 operator's voice.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.178
MALE VOICE: 911.
What is your emergency?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.613
Why would our target want
to distort this voice?

18:00.647 --> 18:03.683
To disguise it.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.185
This could be him.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.419
Right? Our target.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.720
I mean, why else would he do it?

18:07.754 --> 18:08.888
You think he works
at a call center.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.257
I don't know,
it's just a theory.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.824
Let's run this voice

18:11.858 --> 18:12.792
against all
of the male dispatchers

18:12.825 --> 18:14.794
in the New York City
call center database.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.329
All right?

18:16.363 --> 18:17.830
Maybe we'll get lucky here,
get an I.D.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.269
NELSON:
Got him.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.771
RYAN:
Leo Finch.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.439
Look at his profile.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.342
He was fired from the call
center exactly a year ago today.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.378
Well, that's motive for revenge.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.413
Let's see, he was fired for...

18:33.446 --> 18:35.882
"failure to properly
dispatch emergency units,"

18:35.915 --> 18:38.885
"poor decision making,"
"refusal to follow protocol."

18:38.918 --> 18:40.620
Also looks like there
were several instances

18:40.653 --> 18:41.621
of slow dispatch times

18:41.654 --> 18:44.191
and sending paramedics
to the wrong address.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.193
Delayed dispatch times suggests

18:46.226 --> 18:47.860
he wanted to keep
the panicked callers on the line

18:47.894 --> 18:48.728
as long as possible.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.198
He enjoyed hearing
their desperation.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.901
Their pleading made him feel
powerful and in control.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.769
Leo is an auditory voyeur.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.538
Well, that's twisted.
Call Elijah.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.440
Tell him there's a door
he has to kick down.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.183
Clear!

19:10.217 --> 19:11.651
Clear!

19:16.956 --> 19:18.491
Clear!

19:19.526 --> 19:20.527
All clear!
Clear!

19:33.740 --> 19:35.975
MUNDO: Victims are
Mary and Roger Ingram. (sighs)

19:36.008 --> 19:37.244
Ligature marks around the neck

19:37.277 --> 19:39.312
and petechial hemorrhaging in
the eyes suggest strangulation.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.348
We have a time of death?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.283
MUNDO: According to
the on-site coroner report,

19:43.316 --> 19:44.817
body temp puts TOD
somewhere between 5:00

19:44.851 --> 19:46.286
and 7:00 a.m. this morning.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.288
Any signs of forced entry?
No.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.657
And nothing to suggest
that Leo Finch lives here.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.659
Police are canvassing
the area right now,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.927
seeing if anybody
recognizes Leo's photo.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.230
MAN:
Agent Mundo.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.370
KRUMITZ: Looks like Mary
tried to call for help.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.605
She's still clenching
this phone.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.873
Cadaveric spasm.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.642
It occurs in violent,
intense deaths.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.345
That's why her hand is
clenched around the phone.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.680
Battery's dead.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.382
See if it has the virus.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.028
Malware is exactly the same
as all the others.

20:29.061 --> 20:33.266
According to the call log, Mary
tried to call 911 at 6:23 a.m.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.368
Please hurry,
he's strangling my husband.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.370
I think he killed him.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.372
I can hear him coming.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.007
Hello, is anyone there?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.375
Hello?

20:43.876 --> 20:45.412
Hello?

20:50.883 --> 20:51.851
(screams)

20:54.086 --> 20:55.688
MUNDO:
Avery.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.358
There's a basement apartment.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.032
This is an odd setup.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.701
Cheap furniture,
egg carton acoustics,

21:08.735 --> 21:10.370
but very expensive speakers.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.324
Found a laptop.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.692
This is a Benning.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.027
Leo has a $50,000 violin

21:35.061 --> 21:37.029
and lives in a cheap rental?

21:37.063 --> 21:39.399
It's funny--
some of the best coders

21:39.432 --> 21:40.733
are talented musicians.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.470
Both highly technical,
deal with complex numbers.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.405
Clearly, Leo's obsession
was sound.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.774
KRUMITZ:
I'm imaging Leo's computer.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.609
He's over 200 audio files
on his hard drive.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.379
They're all 911 calls,
and he's the operator.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.113
RYAN:
Leo is an addict.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.583
The 911 calls are his drug.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.352
It's like an arsonist
getting a job as a firefighter

21:59.386 --> 22:01.120
or a pedophile
who becomes a teacher.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.356
Leo got his fix
at work.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.957
Until he was fired a year ago,

22:04.991 --> 22:07.927
and he was cut off from his drug

22:07.960 --> 22:11.798
and had to find a new way
to feed his addiction.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.632
The virus.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.668
Whoa, Krumitz, get-- come here.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.504
Is this what I think it is?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.410
That could be
the original source code

22:23.443 --> 22:24.744
for the virus.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.714
Okay, we've got something.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.583
This computer connected
to 26 bus routers

22:30.617 --> 22:33.420
at Port Authority
at 11:00 p.m. last night.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.522
That's 26 patient zeros.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.524
This is not
an experiment gone wrong.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.492
This was a calculated attack.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.494
No, Leo wanted to infect
every corner of the city,

22:41.528 --> 22:43.062
and he wanted to do it fast.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.607
RAMIREZ: 61 confirmed cases
in New Jersey.

22:54.641 --> 22:55.942
38 in Connecticut.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.510
And 23 in Upstate New York.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.111
Even with the news
alerts and warnings,

22:59.145 --> 23:00.947
the virus has officially

23:00.980 --> 23:02.815
spread through the
tristate area.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.452
Well, the good news is the
infection rate should slow down

23:05.485 --> 23:06.553
in the less densely
populated areas.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.720
Bad news?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.722
A complete quarantine
looks impossible.

23:09.756 --> 23:13.426
And local precincts are overrun
with emergency calls

23:13.460 --> 23:14.761
and hospitals are
flooded with walk-ins.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.162
Some people are resorting
to social media

23:16.195 --> 23:17.697
to announce
their emergencies.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.699
Nelson,
we need that antidote.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.933
How's it going?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.134
Krummy sent me
the source code of the virus

23:22.168 --> 23:23.736
from Leo Finch's laptop.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.838
Now that I can see exactly
how the virus is written,

23:25.872 --> 23:28.641
it shouldn't take long to write
a code to counteract it.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.109
But the problem is

23:30.142 --> 23:32.044
how to push it to all
the phones that need it.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.646
Yeah, a software update through
the vendors will take days.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.881
Mm-hmm.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.048
Wait a minute.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.718
What about using something
like the AMBER Alert, right?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.487
It sends
push notifications to phones

23:40.520 --> 23:42.555
during child abductions.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.156
It's instant, it's regional.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.057
What do you think?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.526
I mean, AMBER Alerts
are only designed

23:46.559 --> 23:47.594
to display alphanumeric text.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.195
You can't use them
to push code.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.863
And there are regulations.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.499
I mean, FCC, DOJ, FEMA.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.500
Right.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.635
Are you saying it's impossible?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.904
I'm saying it's never
been done before.
Right.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.238
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.573
You-you two were black
hats, weren't you?

24:00.607 --> 24:01.641
The best.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.975
Notorious.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.644
Okay, so you'll
hack it, right?

24:04.677 --> 24:07.013
And I'll take full
responsibility.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.749
Matter of fact, I will call
Director Silver right now.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.519
Work on the FCC,
DOJ part of this thing.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.987
All right, man said
hack, let's hack.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.576
Look at this.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.179
A pair of pliers,

24:40.212 --> 24:42.715
some kind of metal pins

24:42.749 --> 24:44.651
and a bloody violin string.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.653
I think we may be looking
at the murder weapon.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.621
(screaming)

24:48.655 --> 24:51.090
(both grunting)

24:51.123 --> 24:53.225
All right, well,
whatever Leo's endgame is,

24:53.259 --> 24:55.695
if he left two bodies upstairs
and a murder weapon in the wall,

24:55.728 --> 24:57.597
it's a pretty safe bet
he's not coming back here

24:57.630 --> 24:58.631
anytime soon.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.600
Guys, look at this.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.536
It looks like these three 911
recordings were Leo's favorites.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.705
They were played
over a thousand times.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.574
And he even put them
on a separate playlist.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.708
Here, listen to this.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.643
FINCH:
911, what's your emergency?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.012
MAN: My buddy, he fell!
It's bad; it's-it's real bad!

25:13.045 --> 25:14.881
We need an ambulance!
Sir, what's your location?

25:14.914 --> 25:16.749
MAN: Construction site
at Lexington and 12th!

25:16.783 --> 25:18.317
I don't think he's conscious.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.652
FINCH:
I'm dispatching paramedics now.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.953
Calm down and describe
what you see.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.154
MAN:
There's a lot of blood!

25:22.188 --> 25:23.556
He must've fallen 50 or 60 feet

25:23.590 --> 25:25.224
or something-- please hurry!

25:25.257 --> 25:26.325
There's blood all over his head!

25:26.358 --> 25:27.359
I'm pretty sure
his legs are broken.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.761
FINCH: All right,
be careful not to move him.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.762
Help is on the way.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.230
Is this from today?

25:31.263 --> 25:33.600
Uh, no.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.701
According to the metadata,

25:34.734 --> 25:35.935
this recording's
from two years ago.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.705
But what's strange is that it
happened at the same time of day

25:38.738 --> 25:40.873
as the construction
incident.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.841
Scaffolding pins.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.142
There's traces of paint and rust

25:43.175 --> 25:44.343
in the grooves of the pliers.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.679
What happened at that
construction site this morning

25:46.713 --> 25:47.479
was no accident.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.848
MAN:
All right,
what do we got?

25:48.881 --> 25:49.916
(creaking)

25:49.949 --> 25:51.317
Help! Help!

25:51.350 --> 25:52.752
Play the next one.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.921
FINCH:
911, what's your emergency?

25:54.954 --> 25:55.722
WOMAN:
Please help.

25:55.755 --> 25:56.989
Someone just broke
into my house.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.357
He's strangling my husband.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.059
I'm hiding in a closet.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.761
FINCH:
Try to stay calm, ma'am.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.095
I'm showing your address
as 754 Plymouth Way.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.764
Is that correct?

26:04.797 --> 26:05.765
WOMAN:
Yes, please hurry!

26:05.798 --> 26:07.066
I can hear him in the kitchen.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.701
Oh! I think my husband's dead.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.969
FINCH:
Help is on the way.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.237
WOMAN:
Why is this taking so long?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.239
Why is no one coming?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.775
This is very similar
to the scene upstairs.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.309
This is exactly what happened

26:17.343 --> 26:19.311
to Mary and Roger Ingram.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.780
This is also
another old recording

26:20.813 --> 26:22.181
and it happened
at the same time

26:22.214 --> 26:24.817
as the murders
this morning, 6:23 a.m.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.820
Listening is
a deeply immersive experience.

26:27.854 --> 26:28.921
FINCH:
Sir, what's your location?

26:28.955 --> 26:31.023
MAN: Construction site
at Lexington...

26:31.057 --> 26:33.192
RYAN: Every time Leo listen
to one of these recordings,

26:33.225 --> 26:35.695
he envisioned himself
in the scene.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.830
We need an ambulance.
RYAN:
First, he's a witness.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.131
...can't tell if he's alive.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.300
There's blood everywhere
and he's not moving.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.069
RYAN:
Then he's the victim.
Please help.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.004
Someone just broke
into my house.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.405
He's strangling my husband.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.974
(creaks)

26:48.007 --> 26:49.676
RYAN:
Now, Leo's the killer.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.843
(woman gasps)
No.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.111
No, no!

26:52.144 --> 26:54.681
He's recreating
his greatest hits.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.082
(woman screams)
KRUMITZ:
Yeah, but what does the virus

26:56.115 --> 26:57.684
have to do with all this?
And why today?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.818
RYAN:
It's the anniversary

26:58.851 --> 27:00.319
of the day he was fired.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.421
Look, Leo is a sadist

27:02.454 --> 27:04.190
who's aroused
by the sound of fear.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.793
The virus does
everything that he needs.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.696
The dropped calls delay
the emergency responders,

27:09.729 --> 27:12.732
which maximizes
the victims' panic.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.067
Leo records the calls

27:15.101 --> 27:16.769
so he can enjoy them later.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.871
It's his version

27:18.905 --> 27:20.339
of a serial killer
taking a trophy.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.407
Krumitz, didn't
you say there were

27:21.440 --> 27:23.042
three recordings
on that playlist?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.046
FINCH:
911, what's your emergency?

27:27.079 --> 27:28.147
BOY:
Help! He's stabbing him.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.782
He's stabbing my dad!

27:29.816 --> 27:31.250
FINCH:
What's your name? Where are you?

27:31.283 --> 27:33.185
BOY: Dylan.
And I don't know where I am.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.754
We just... we left the game.

27:34.787 --> 27:35.755
It's an alley.

27:35.788 --> 27:36.756
FINCH:
Help is on the way.

27:36.789 --> 27:37.790
BOY:
The man just left!

27:37.824 --> 27:38.791
I'm scared.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.192
FINCH:
It's okay, Dylan.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.928
I need you to go to your dad
Tell me what you see.

27:41.961 --> 27:42.929
BOY: He's not moving!

27:42.962 --> 27:44.430
(whimpering)

27:44.463 --> 27:47.867
Leo mimicked the first two
recordings on the playlist.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.435
And this recording

27:49.468 --> 27:51.437
is of a man being stabbed in
an alley in front of his son.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.239
It happened
at 8:53 at night.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.141
This is his next move.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.408
He's gonna kill again.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.810
We need to stop Leo Finch.

27:57.844 --> 27:58.878
MUNDO:
Yeah, but how?

27:58.911 --> 28:00.112
There are thousands of alleys
in New York City.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.926
Okay, everybody, listen up.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.963
We're basically looking
for a-an alley in a haystack.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.231
Leo's two copycat killings

28:19.265 --> 28:22.234
took place the same time
of day as the original crimes,

28:22.268 --> 28:24.971
which means at approximately
8:53 tonight,

28:25.004 --> 28:27.173
somebody is gonna get stabbed.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.076
So let's get going on this.
All right?

28:30.109 --> 28:32.211
We've got just over an hour
to find this Leo Finch

28:32.244 --> 28:34.280
before he finds his next victim.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.249
D.B., I figured out
what the three 911 calls

28:37.283 --> 28:39.051
on Leo's playlist
all have in common.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.820
They all lasted
over 20 minutes...

28:40.853 --> 28:43.790
almost three times longer
than your average 911 call.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.225
The victims all
died because Leo

28:46.258 --> 28:48.127
didn't dispatch
the paramedics in time.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.196
So he orchestrated their deaths.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.430
NELSON:
Just spoke to the NYPD.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.065
They issued a BOLO for Leo.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.300
And I sent them the antidote.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.802
They'll push it
to all cell phones in the area

28:55.835 --> 28:57.169
using AMBER Alerts.
Right.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.470
So you guys figured out the, uh,

28:58.504 --> 29:00.372
alphanumeric problem,
did you?

29:00.406 --> 29:02.041
We used a buffer
overflow exploit,

29:02.074 --> 29:03.542
thank you very much.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.212
NELSON: That's right.
It'll flood the phones

29:06.245 --> 29:07.113
with a specific sequence of text

29:07.146 --> 29:09.148
to force the NYPD home page
to pop up.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.250
Now, that home page will have
a download for the antidote.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.152
Basically, we're geniuses.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.353
Exactly.
Basically.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.187
Basically.
Do me a favor,
though, will you?

29:15.221 --> 29:17.556
Call NYPD back,
tell them to display

29:17.589 --> 29:19.491
a photo of Leo Finch
with the antidote.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.461
Might as well make the city
our eyes and ears.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.330
Uh... yeah, uh...

29:24.363 --> 29:25.898
I think you should do that.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.399
Why is that?
Might get
a little pushback.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.036
Apparently, they've been
chatting with my pal the mayor.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.470
Yeah, Nelson,
this has nothing to do

29:31.503 --> 29:33.005
with your Stock Exchange hack,
all right?

29:33.039 --> 29:34.340
Call them back,

29:34.373 --> 29:35.942
tell them to post the photo

29:35.975 --> 29:37.910
and the antidote.
Come on, buddy.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.511
This is your hero moment.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.914
You got this, Nelson.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.282
Right, right.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.250
My hero moment.
All right.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.598
I just talked to
the police chief.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.401
He told me that you're
using an AMBER Alert

30:02.434 --> 30:05.271
to send out an antidote
written by Brody Nelson.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.272
That's correct.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.073
We'll have to verify that code

30:07.106 --> 30:08.975
before it goes out
to the public.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.342
I've hired a private
security firm.

30:10.376 --> 30:13.179
No, that's not necessary
and we don't have the time.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.513
We are chasing a killer, here.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.582
I'm well aware of that,
and I'm shocked

30:16.615 --> 30:18.084
that you would even
trust a black hat

30:18.117 --> 30:19.385
with something this critical.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.353
I've heard about your
unconventional tactics,

30:21.387 --> 30:22.288
Deputy Director,

30:22.321 --> 30:24.256
but this is inappropriate
and dangerous.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.925
Mayor Cavanaugh,
how many more lives

30:25.958 --> 30:27.126
are you willing to jeopardize?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.294
No one cares more

30:28.327 --> 30:30.296
about the citizens
of this city than I do.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.397
That's why I'm here.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.200
Brody Nelson's antidote
will save lives.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.302
Now, I could go
over your head with this,

30:36.335 --> 30:38.404
but I'm not sure
that you could weather

30:38.437 --> 30:40.272
the political embarrassment.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.541
If this goes sideways,
it's on you.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.247
*

30:49.615 --> 30:52.184
(indistinct chatter,
phone chimes)

31:12.939 --> 31:15.074
RAMIREZ:
The public's responding
to the AMBER Alert.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.109
I've got multiple reports
of Leo Finch

31:17.143 --> 31:18.677
at Madison and 140th.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.811
Pellham Park.
That's Harlem.

31:19.845 --> 31:22.181
Yeah, but we've got several
sightings on the east side.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.450
I mean, guy can't be
in two places at once.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.118
Dopplegangers?

31:26.152 --> 31:27.453
No.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.487
No, we made
a mistake. Uh...

31:28.520 --> 31:29.922
What do you mean?

31:29.956 --> 31:32.124
We sent the AMBER Alert
to everyone.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.260
Everyone.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.461
Including Leo Finch.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.508
Yeah, okay, all right.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.509
Time to call Mom.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.578
Let's get Avery on the phone.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.947
Um, Avery.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.082
We're striking out here.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.418
It looks like Leo could be
reporting false sightings.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.287
So what do you think?

32:01.320 --> 32:03.422
Let's review everything
we know about Leo Finch.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.024
We know that
he's meticulous

32:05.057 --> 32:06.458
about the details
in his recreations.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.460
The boy in the third
911 call said

32:08.494 --> 32:10.696
that he and his dad
were leaving a game.
MUNDO: The police report said

32:10.729 --> 32:12.498
Mets tickets were found
in the dad's jacket pocket.

32:12.531 --> 32:13.499
It was a baseball game.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.700
Yeah, but it's not
baseball season.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.137
RYAN: Well, let's concentrate
on another sporting event.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.340
All right, here we go.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.308
I got hockey in Manhattan,
basketball in Brooklyn.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.376
MUNDO:
Which one fits our window?
Both.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.712
Let's compare them
with the BOLO locations.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.380
Okay, we've got
six sightings of Leo

32:28.414 --> 32:30.616
around the arena in Manhattan,
only one in Brooklyn.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.384
RYAN:
It's the hockey game.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.320
Which ends in 15 minutes.

32:34.353 --> 32:35.988
KRUMITZ: The original stabbing
took place in an alley

32:36.022 --> 32:37.990
two blocks away
from the stadium.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.658
All right, how many alleys
are there within that range

32:39.691 --> 32:41.193
of the arena?

32:41.227 --> 32:42.561
One second.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.263
RAMIREZ:
Three.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.265
All right, well, this is a guy
that sticks to details, right?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.399
Let's pull up some old
crime scene photos,

32:47.433 --> 32:49.268
see if we can narrow
it down to one.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.403
Remember, Leo is a
deviant audiophile.

32:51.437 --> 32:54.273
It isn't about what we see,
it's about what we hear.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.375
Raven, pull up
the original 911 recording

32:56.408 --> 32:58.177
of the alley stabbing.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.378
Isolate the background sound.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.646
Okay.

33:00.679 --> 33:01.713
FINCH: 911.
What's your emergency?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.582
BOY:
Help, he's stabbing him!

33:03.615 --> 33:04.583
He's stabbing my dad!

33:04.616 --> 33:05.584
FINCH:
What's your name?

33:05.617 --> 33:07.119
Stop. Go back.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.120
(rumbling)

33:08.154 --> 33:09.588
That's an elevated train.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.457
Pull up a subway map.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.426
Look for any trains near
the arena that go above ground.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.665
RAMIREZ: Got it, it's the alley
between West 4th and Bleeker.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.101
Notify the arena.
I'll have 'em redirect crowds
away from that alley,

33:22.134 --> 33:23.769
have NYPD clear
the streets.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.003
Let's go get Leo Finch.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.659
(siren chirps)
MUNDO: It's over, Leo!

33:47.693 --> 33:49.128
FBI!

33:49.161 --> 33:51.663
We have you surrounded!

33:51.697 --> 33:53.665
Got a visual on Leo,
he is armed.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.068
Drop the knife, Leo!

33:57.336 --> 33:58.804
Nobody's coming out
of that arena.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.773
We've sealed the exits,
we've cleared the streets.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.375
There's no one here
for you to harm.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.111
So drop the knife.
Drop it now.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.678
They're mine!

34:06.712 --> 34:08.180
They're mine!
You can't take them!

34:08.214 --> 34:09.215
Do not take one more step.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.216
Give them back to me!

34:10.249 --> 34:11.517
They're all I have!

34:11.550 --> 34:13.585
MUNDO: Take one more step,
and I will shoot!

34:15.454 --> 34:17.456
RYAN:
Stand down, Elijah.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.091
We confiscated his computer.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.460
He's talking about the
recordings he had saved on it.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.562
MUNDO:
He came here to kill someone.

34:23.595 --> 34:24.796
He came to satisfy an addiction.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.565
Leo's a junkie.
He came to get a fix.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.234
We could still
end this peacefully.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.836
Krumitz, pull up the third
recording on Leo's playlist.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.239
We need to find a way to play
it for Leo at the scene.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.808
Okay, the squad cars all have
P.A. systems with bullhorns.

34:36.842 --> 34:37.876
Operator, this is
Agent Daniel Krumitz.

34:37.909 --> 34:38.877
Connect me to dispatch.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.078
MAN:
Hold your fire!

34:40.112 --> 34:44.250
KRUMITZ: Officer, I need you
to turn on your P.A. system.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.720
FINCH: 911.
What's your emergency?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.556
BOY: Help, he's stabbing him!
He's stabbing my dad!

34:50.589 --> 34:52.824
FINCH: What's your name?
Where are you?

34:52.858 --> 34:53.792
BOY: Dylan, I don't know
where I am.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.661
We just... we left the game.
It's an alley.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.729
FINCH:
Help is on the way.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.831
BOY: The man just left.
I'm scared.

34:59.865 --> 35:02.334
FINCH: Hey, Dylan, I need you
to go to your dad.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.502
Tell me what you see.

35:03.535 --> 35:04.736
BOY:
He's not moving.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.308
He was going for his knife.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.349
Someone call 911.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.351
I've been hurt.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.387
I need help.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.893
*

35:37.669 --> 35:40.206
Nice code, brother. Huh?

35:40.239 --> 35:42.241
You're gonna
leave me hanging?
My bad, bro.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.410
(scoffs)
That's old news, Nelson.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.645
NELSON: Yeah, but not to the
mayor of New York City.

35:46.678 --> 35:47.479
I mean, all he saw
was a black hat

35:47.513 --> 35:48.914
who brought down
the stock exchange.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.916
(scoffs) It's like
no matter what I do right,

35:50.949 --> 35:52.584
I can't shake what I did wrong.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.253
This is what pops up
when I Google my name.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.254
Look at this.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.723
RYAN:
Hey, come on.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.591
You didn't have to come
back to Washington.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.459
You could have stayed
in New York.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.629
I know, but I was...
I was a distraction.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.731
You had to go
to bat for me.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.666
It's not like anything Mayor
Cavanaugh said wasn't true.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.236
Really? You really
took that eight million?

36:10.269 --> 36:11.537
Except for that, Krummy.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.639
Hey, we cleared you
of that long ago.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.308
The fact remains
you can't rewrite history,

36:16.342 --> 36:17.843
but you can make it.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.279
And that is exactly
what you did today.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.513
Own that.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.682
You should be
very proud of yourself.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.684
Thank you, Avery.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.523
KRUMITZ:
Eight million.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.958
Oh, my God.
You can tell me.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.527
I won't tell anybody.
Come on, you know where it is.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.529
Let's go get it
right now.
I didn't steal it.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.897
But I'm gonna find out

36:38.930 --> 36:40.599
who did.

36:40.632 --> 36:44.603
And when I do... I'm gonna put
that bastard in prison.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.744
Here, let me read
this to you.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.513
Okay.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.350
"I'm taking a chance, hoping
this is still your number.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.986
"I know it's been two years.
But fingers crossed,

37:01.019 --> 37:02.854
"and divorce in the rearview...

37:02.888 --> 37:04.690
Maybe?"
Question mark.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.292
"I'm at
Le Petit Paris

37:06.325 --> 37:09.528
every night from 8:00
until they throw me out."

37:09.561 --> 37:11.029
And then she signs it:
"Foolish Heart."

37:11.062 --> 37:12.698
So you got a new phone

37:12.731 --> 37:15.334
and her new number, and whoever
had that number before you

37:15.367 --> 37:17.336
was supposed to get that text.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.705
I-I know, I should have texted
her right back when I got it,

37:19.738 --> 37:20.806
but I didn't, I-I waited.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.641
But then I figured,
you know,

37:22.674 --> 37:26.812
she would assume that her text
hadn't gone through, right?

37:26.845 --> 37:28.079
Mm-hmm.
And maybe that was better

37:28.113 --> 37:31.817
than letting her know that I,
you know, a complete stranger,

37:31.850 --> 37:34.786
knew that she'd...
put herself out there.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.021
And I just didn't want

37:36.054 --> 37:37.423
to embarrass her.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.358
How do you know it's a her?

37:40.392 --> 37:41.693
Well, that's a good point.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.395
Okay, end of conversation.
(laughs)

37:43.429 --> 37:44.663
No, wait a minute.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.299
You fantasized
about who it would be, D.B.
No, I didn't,

37:47.333 --> 37:48.334
no, I didn't.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.535
Yeah, you investigated it.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.669
No, I did not investigate.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.404
Yeah, you did.
I called the restaurant.

37:52.438 --> 37:53.805
(gasps) See?
That's all. I call... (laughs)

37:53.839 --> 37:56.742
They said that
a rather attractive woman

37:56.775 --> 37:58.877
came there every night
the same time.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.879
And I... I knew

38:00.912 --> 38:03.349
that she was roughly
in my age group.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.584
Oh.
"Foolish Heart."

38:05.617 --> 38:07.719
That's a reference
to a Steve Perry song.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.721
*

38:09.755 --> 38:11.590
That's a rock star
before your time.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.626
Anyway, this...
the whole text, it just...

38:14.660 --> 38:16.895
you know, it seemed
so brave and... and honest,

38:16.928 --> 38:18.797
and... I'm curious.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.467
You hijacked another man's text.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.868
Yes, I did.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.769
(both laugh)

38:23.802 --> 38:25.637
So you're gonna meet her
at the restaurant,

38:25.671 --> 38:26.738
or what?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.975
No. No.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.010
*

38:35.581 --> 38:38.884
(indistinct chatter)

38:46.792 --> 38:48.760
(sighs)

38:54.800 --> 38:56.468
(inhales sharply)

38:57.469 --> 38:59.471
*

39:01.407 --> 39:03.675
(ice rattling)

39:04.710 --> 39:05.877
Hi.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.079
Hi.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.881
(chuckles):
Forgive me for asking,

39:09.915 --> 39:12.050
but are-are you...
here alone?

39:12.083 --> 39:13.485
Uh...

39:13.519 --> 39:14.853
I am.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.121
Yeah. Of course.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.789
Um... sorry, no,

39:17.823 --> 39:18.724
I don't mean of course,
I mean...

39:18.757 --> 39:21.159
I have a confession to make.
Oh, really?

39:21.192 --> 39:23.395
Shouldn't I know your name
before we jump

39:23.429 --> 39:25.030
right into the serious stuff?
Yes, yeah.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.098
Sorry. Uh, D.B.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.867
Greer.
Nice to meet you.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.436
See, I, uh...

39:30.469 --> 39:33.872
I received this today,
and... obviously,

39:33.905 --> 39:35.741
it was not meant for me.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.142
I should have texted
you right back,

39:37.175 --> 39:39.044
but I didn't, and I'm sorry.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.913
Mmm.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.982
Yeah. Yeah, awkward.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.784
No, not for me.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.053
Because I didn't write
that text.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.822
(laughs): Really.

39:50.856 --> 39:51.923
You're kidding.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.859
Oh, boy. (sighs)

39:54.893 --> 39:56.828
So...

39:57.863 --> 39:59.998
(laughing):
Oh...

40:00.031 --> 40:01.867
Oh, man.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.936
Well, shame on her.
(laughs)

40:04.970 --> 40:07.539
Soliciting men via text.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.907
So...

40:08.940 --> 40:10.876
can I buy you a drink?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.177
Really?

40:12.210 --> 40:14.980
Seems like you could use one.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.849
Shouldn't I know your last name
before we... jump into

40:17.883 --> 40:20.786
the serious stuff?
Greer Latimore.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.821
D.B. Russell.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.890
Nice to meet you.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.925
You, too.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.195
* Foolish heart...
So, uh...

40:30.228 --> 40:31.963
what do you do...

40:31.997 --> 40:33.198
Greer Latimore?

40:33.231 --> 40:35.467
Former Secret Service.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.936
Dabble in...
private investigations.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.505
* Foolish, foolish heart...
Nuh-uh.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.772
Uh-huh.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.908
Oh, boy.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.942
What are you drinking?

40:43.975 --> 40:45.511
* You've been wrong before...
Something manly.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.845
(laughs)

40:46.878 --> 40:48.113
Okay.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.581
Tequila.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.750
Very manly.
Yes, yes.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.784
* Foolish, foolish heart...
Excuse me.
