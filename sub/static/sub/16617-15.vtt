00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>

Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.881
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:17.117 --> 00:18.784
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:18.786 --> 00:20.119
Has he said anything at all?

00:20.121 --> 00:21.954
CAROL: Not yet.
We have to call him something.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.689
Uh, Jasper,
Jasper!

00:23.691 --> 00:24.990
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm doing wrong.</i>

00:24.992 --> 00:27.126
<i>I mean, I'm bending over</i>
<i>backwards for this kid.</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:29.161
<i>Pulling out all the stops.</i>

00:29.163 --> 00:30.295
MELISSA:
Carol,

00:30.297 --> 00:31.697
you're pregnant.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.798
What are you up to?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.299
Uh, just going to give
Melissa her medication.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.402
Apparently, it takes
a few weeks to see results.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.242
(buzzing)

00:49.883 --> 00:51.016
What's with
all the amps?

00:51.018 --> 00:52.051
Shh!

00:52.053 --> 00:53.218
(whispering):
I'm trying to listen.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.553
Listen to what?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.355
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

00:56.357 --> 00:57.756
Listen to Jasper.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.929
What's that?

01:03.931 --> 01:05.731
I slapped one of these
bad boys on him.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.200
Oh, you got to see him, he
looks just like Britney Spears,

01:08.202 --> 01:09.435
and that's a major compliment

01:09.437 --> 01:11.070
'cause I always found her
very attractive.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.105
I mean, not that I'm
attracted to Jasper.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.406
Okay, this is all coming out
very wrong.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.908
So you're spying on him.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.109
I mean, he still hasn't talked,

01:17.111 --> 01:18.844
so I'm just trying to
figure out if he talks

01:18.846 --> 01:20.879
when we're not around.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.281
MAN:<i> Do you have something</i>
<i>broken in here?</i>

01:22.283 --> 01:23.615
Oh, my God,
oh, my God!

01:23.617 --> 01:25.551
<i>'Cause I'm a repairman.</i>

01:25.553 --> 01:27.853
Deep baritone on that kid.
MAN:<i> Let me bring out my tool.</i>

01:27.855 --> 01:29.955
Tandy, I don't
think that's Ja...
(shushes)

01:29.957 --> 01:31.857
<i>Where exactly is the problem?</i>

01:31.859 --> 01:33.459
WOMAN:
<i>Right in here.</i>

01:33.461 --> 01:34.693
Wait, who's that woman?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.462
<i>(funky music plays)</i>

01:36.464 --> 01:38.363
What the hell?

01:44.037 --> 01:45.237
Oh, no, Jasper,

01:45.239 --> 01:47.206
that's not for you.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.575
Tandy, Jasper got into your
self-pleasuring library.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.443
Oh...

01:51.445 --> 01:54.213
Ah, yeah, no, I know
this one very well, yeah.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.281
The repairman is there
to fix a clogged pipe,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.050
and then gets sidetracked
and, you know,

01:58.052 --> 02:00.119
winds up doing some sexual
stuff with his customer.
Tandy!

02:00.121 --> 02:02.788
Aah!
Oh, sorry, you're
right, spoiler.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.922
(stammering):
Uh, no,

02:03.924 --> 02:05.757
uh, Jasper, this
is for adults.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.758
You understand?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.860
(funky music resumes)

02:14.000 --> 02:15.834
(crickets chirping)

02:20.306 --> 02:21.306
Hey, bud.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.308
(chuckles)

02:23.310 --> 02:26.145
Looking at the stars, huh?

02:26.147 --> 02:27.746
Look at that.
Did you see that?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.081
A shooting star.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.150
That means that you
get to make a wish.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.751
You know what
my wish is?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.786
That I could take back
those things you saw

02:34.788 --> 02:36.855
in that sensual video.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.190
Now, I can't do that,

02:38.192 --> 02:40.492
but I can make this
a teachable moment.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.361
Follow me.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.563
Take a frog.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.135
What we're doing now is having

02:50.137 --> 02:52.938
what's called
"the birds and the bees" talk.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.439
Okay?

02:54.441 --> 02:56.642
So, why birds and bees?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.377
Well, 'cause they're
famously known as

02:58.379 --> 03:00.512
the horniest
of the flight animals.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.214
You following
me so far?

03:02.216 --> 03:03.549
Okay, well,

03:03.551 --> 03:07.352
here's where it gets a little
funky and a little cool.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.289
So the bird takes his,
uh, "mm"

03:10.291 --> 03:11.823
and, uh, uh,
puts it in

03:11.825 --> 03:13.358
the bee's "hmm."

03:13.360 --> 03:15.394
Know what I'm saying? Yeah.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.696
And so anyway, they
just keep them in there

03:17.698 --> 03:19.898
and they just
move them around, uh,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.367
for what's usually a very,
very short period of time.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.036
Right?

03:24.038 --> 03:26.138
And, uh, that's the birds
and bees talk. Yeah.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.739
(chuckles) God, thought
it'd be harder than that.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.374
Well-- but, hey,
that's what the bee said.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.609
(laughs)
Boom.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.814
Melissa, would you mind
wandering around like a zombie

03:35.816 --> 03:36.982
somewhere else, please?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.383
Yeah, Jasper and I

03:38.385 --> 03:40.552
are having the, uh... talk.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.421
Hey, don't be scared,

03:42.423 --> 03:43.722
she's not a zombie.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.058
Oh, you probably don't even
know what a zombie is.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.026
Well... you know
when someone dies?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.861
Well, a zombie

03:49.863 --> 03:51.930
is a corpse that
comes back to life.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.532
And they're terrifying.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.934
I mean, they have an insatiable
appetite for human flesh,

03:55.936 --> 03:58.036
and they just keep coming
after you and after you,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.037
till they get you

03:59.039 --> 04:00.606
And they're so fast.
(chuckles)

04:00.608 --> 04:02.274
Oh, my God.
TODD: Oh, there you are, hon.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.275
Cannibals are...

04:03.277 --> 04:04.776
Melissa...
Todd?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.678
Huh?
Could you please get
Melissa out of here?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.513
She's really freaking
Jasper out.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.849
I'm sorry, buddy. Here, hon,
it's time for your medication.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.518
She's kind of in a foggy stage.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.920
I've been having to guess
on her dosage.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.555
I'm not exactly sure
how much to give her, so...

04:16.557 --> 04:18.023
Less maybe?

04:18.025 --> 04:18.924
Yeah.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.392
But maybe more, though.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.427
That's kind of where I'm at.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.062
Hey, bud.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.464
Come on. Oh.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.099
(chuckles)

04:27.101 --> 04:28.934
GAIL:
<i>Aw, look at this.</i>

04:31.371 --> 04:33.772
He is a great little artist.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.041
I thought it was important
he have all his stuff here.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.476
Make him feel more comfortable.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.411
Whoa, baby bump alert.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.546
Yeah.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.749
Looks more like a
beer belly alert.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.083
GAIL:
Hush.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.885
You look fantastic.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.121
Baby bump, huh?

04:49.123 --> 04:50.422
Yeah, it's crazy.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.724
I actually popped a button
on my pants yesterday.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.227
Ah!
(laughs)

04:55.229 --> 04:58.830
Funny, this
button-popping story.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.500
I don't recall you
wearing pants yesterday...

05:01.502 --> 05:03.435
Well, that's 'cause I popped
a button on them.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.603
Uh-huh.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.905
Can I see these pants?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.441
Carol, what do you want
with her mother-grabbin' pants?

05:09.443 --> 05:11.610
She just told this intense story

05:11.612 --> 05:14.579
of a button blasting off
the front of her jeans,

05:14.581 --> 05:17.316
even though her belly pretty
much looks the same to me.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.351
So I'm just wondering
where these magical,

05:19.353 --> 05:21.153
button-popping pants are?

05:21.155 --> 05:22.788
Are they in
Al Capone's vault,

05:22.790 --> 05:25.590
or talking to
a Sasquatch and a yeti

05:25.592 --> 05:28.427
at the bottom of
the Loch Ness lake?

05:28.429 --> 05:30.128
(laughs)

05:30.130 --> 05:31.997
I can show you the pants, Carol.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.598
It's fine, I don't want
to see them.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.934
But, yeah, happy for you.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.370
And your bump.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.705
Oh, boy.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.343
I'm starting to wonder
if he's ever gonna talk.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.777
Maybe it's neurological.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.812
GAIL: No, I know
he understands us.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.314
I've seen him
roll his eyes at Tandy

05:49.316 --> 05:51.183
enough times to know that.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.285
Yeah, the eye roll
is a classic sign of respect.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.488
I just don't understand
not talking.

05:56.490 --> 06:00.525
Whenever I have the urge
to not talk, I talk about it.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.526
Witness.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.661
I mean, I totally get it.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.862
I mean, think about
what he's been through.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.197
You know, his parents died,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.299
he's been on his own since
he was like four or five.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.434
I know, he's been robbed
of his whole childhood.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.837
Missed all those birthdays,

06:11.839 --> 06:13.171
all those Christmases,

06:13.173 --> 06:14.539
all those Halloweens.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.241
He was so young when
the virus hit, I mean,

06:16.243 --> 06:18.076
he might not even know what
any of those holidays are.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.544
Poor little guy.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.213
I have an idea.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.850
Why don't we throw
a big party for Jasper?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.385
Like a birthday party?

06:26.387 --> 06:28.487
Oh, I'm talking birthday,

06:28.489 --> 06:32.557
Christmas, Easter,
Halloween, Kwanzaa,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.359
Flag Day, Toyotathon,

06:34.361 --> 06:36.495
like, every joyous
occasion you've ever had

06:36.497 --> 06:39.731
just rolled into one
festive smorgasbord.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.932
That's a great idea.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.068
We give him a chance to be
a friggin' kid for once.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.036
I love it.
You guys, you know, I think

06:45.038 --> 06:46.571
this'll be really good
for Melissa, too.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.941
TODD:
Hey! No, no.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.477
No, no, no. No, those don't go
in there, hon.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.347
Those don't go in there.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.183
It's okay,
they just don't go in there.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.384
ERICA:
Okay.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.419
Let's start planning.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.287
Yeah.
Okay.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.358
Hey, bud, can I talk
to you for a sec?

07:06.360 --> 07:07.726
Sure, yeah, what's up, bud?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.027
Well, it's about the party.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.629
You know,
I think it might be best

07:10.631 --> 07:12.397
if Melissa sits this one out.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.532
She's doing way better.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.100
I mean, she doesn't need
her drool towel anymore.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.035
You know, stools are
way less tarry.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.036
Aren't they, Melissa?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.070
Hmm?

07:19.072 --> 07:20.038
Your stools.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.641
Yep.
Yeah, see?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.943
Real happy to hear
those are firming up for her,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.711
but this party's about Jasper,

07:26.713 --> 07:28.613
and I just don't think
he's feeling very comfortable

07:28.615 --> 07:29.714
around her right now.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.983
Oh, so hide the weirdo, huh?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.085
Is that what you're saying?
Exactly.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.087
You know what? Just, uh,
enjoy planning your party.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.223
I'll just go tell Melissa
she can go to hell.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.158
Oh, thanks, bud.
(chuckles)

07:41.727 --> 07:42.994
Ridiculous.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.240
Oh, hey, don't
worry about her,

07:55.242 --> 07:56.475
she's not
gonna hurt you.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.909
Here, come on
down from there.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.144
Hey, what's going on?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.646
Jasper's petrified
of Melissa.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.482
Yeah-- uh, I got this,
don't worry about it.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.284
Hey, bud, don't be
afraid of her, okay?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.786
She's just playing
make-believe.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.654
Uh, she's rehearsing
for the title role

08:09.656 --> 08:12.824
in a stage production of
<i>The Exorcism of Emily Rose.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:13.925
Oh, come on, Tandy.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.026
Oh, that isn't cool, yeah,

08:15.028 --> 08:16.695
he doesn't know
what an exorcism is.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.030
An exorcism is when a demon
takes over a person's body

08:19.032 --> 08:20.665
and just makes them
do terrible things.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.801
Okay, I got to say
something here.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.436
I think it's wrong to keep
Jasper away from Melissa.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.670
How is he ever

08:25.672 --> 08:26.805
gonna get comfortable around her

08:26.807 --> 08:28.273
if you won't let him
get to know her?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.374
I will.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.475
Look, right now,

08:30.477 --> 08:32.277
he just needs to get
over that comfort hump,

08:32.279 --> 08:34.379
then we can totally throw
Melissa into the mix.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.847
All right, okay.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.982
Okay, bye, Todd.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.316
Bye, Emily Rose.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.784
Uh, sorry, Melissa.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.454
Jasper? Ah, man.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.656
Jasper?

08:44.658 --> 08:47.459
Ridiculous.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.860
CAROL:
<i>There it is, there it is.</i>

08:48.862 --> 08:50.929
GAIL:
<i>All right.</i>

08:52.798 --> 08:55.200
Ah, shoot, I left
my gun in the car.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.369
Be right back.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.973
Oh, geez.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.543
What's this down here again?
(chuckles)

09:04.545 --> 09:06.978
Lost a few buttons
down there, I see.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.914
You think?
(chuckles)

09:08.916 --> 09:10.682
Ever since you mentioned
your button popping off,

09:10.684 --> 09:11.750
it's been crazy.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.386
Lost 16 yesterday.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.821
Ah, you're really
having a time there.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.423
Tell me about it.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.226
It's like a sharknado
but with buttons.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.194
Yeah, you be careful.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.263
Aw, what can I say?
It's the life we've chosen.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.832
Preggers can't be choosers.
Yeah.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.135
Ooh, whoa.
Whoa!

09:35.174 --> 09:38.076
Couldn't find my gun,
so I used the car.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.911
Well, you just saw.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.415
ERICA:
Oh, this is great.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.616
CAROL:
Yeah.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.587
TODD:
How's this place for a picnic?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.188
Okay,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.090
let's see what we have here.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.928
Hey, this isn't what I packed.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.231
This basket is filled
with toys and treats.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.567
Melissa, did you
empty this basket

10:02.569 --> 10:06.137
and fill it with toys and treats
for Jasper?

10:06.139 --> 10:07.072
No.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.307
(laughs)
I'm not mad.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.011
You have a fun-loving spirit.
You're accessible.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.281
Hey, Jasper!

10:16.283 --> 10:17.983
You want some
of these toys and treats

10:17.985 --> 10:19.718
that Melissa
brought for you?

10:21.721 --> 10:24.789
Well, they're over here
if you change your mind.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.059
Oh, my God!
A water gun?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.628
I'm gonna get you.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.062
(laughs)

10:35.167 --> 10:37.969
Well, well, well.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.171
What's going on here?

10:40.173 --> 10:44.309
I-- I was just, uh,
having a picnic with Melissa.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.344
Oh, that's weird.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.813
Don't think I ever remember
you having a picnic before.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.649
No, yeah,
I have picnics all the time.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.083
Oh, you do? All the time?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.319
All the time,
having picnics all the time.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.621
(chuckles)

10:56.623 --> 10:58.189
Why don't you name 20 picnics
you've had before.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.257
Come on. Now.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.292
Uh, t-t-today. Okay?

11:01.294 --> 11:02.994
Yeah, that's one. One picnic.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.663
In-in Malibu.
I had one on the beach.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.431
That's two. 18 more, come on.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.199
Uh, uh...
Come on!

11:08.201 --> 11:10.335
Name 18 more picnics, Todd! Now!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.003
I can't think of any! Okay?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.305
No, you can't.
'Cause you're lying about

11:14.307 --> 11:16.274
your affinity for picnics,
Todd, aren't you?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.542
Well, excuse me

11:17.544 --> 11:19.210
for trying
to establish a connection

11:19.212 --> 11:20.679
between Jasper and Melissa.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.946
You're not excused.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.782
I just know that
once he gets to know her,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.183
he'll see how awesome she is.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.886
Oh, so that makes it okay to
lie about a friggin' picnic!

11:27.888 --> 11:29.788
Well, I'm not the only one
who's lying, am I?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.523
That's different
and you know it.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.325
I'm just trying to protect
my son and give him the nice,

11:34.327 --> 11:35.727
safe party that
he deserves.
TODD: Yeah, well,

11:35.729 --> 11:36.961
you know what,
don't worry because

11:36.963 --> 11:38.863
Melissa and I won't be
at your stupid party.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.200
Todd, look,
it's okay if<i> you</i> come.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.535
Oh, really?
What day is it again?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.103
Oh, it's tonight.
I'm busy.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.006
Fine.
Fine.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.240
Fine.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.975

16:07.600 --> 16:09.968
You and Gail have made that
abundantly clear.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.469
Excuse me?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.572
What would me and my flat belly
know about Labor Day, right?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.775
Meanwhile you're over there
laughing it up on Fat Tuesday

16:17.777 --> 16:20.244
with your pulchritudinous
belly bump.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.748
Carol, I got pregnant
a few weeks before you.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.751
How can you be jealous
that my baby bump came first?

16:26.753 --> 16:29.153
I'm not jealous
that your baby bump came first.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.755
Then what the hell's
your problem?

16:30.757 --> 16:33.791
I'm jealous that your baby bump
came at all.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.160
Oh.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.762
I'm just really scared.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.064
I mean, what if my bump
never comes?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.835
I haven't had
any pregnancy symptoms.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.536
What if the test was off?

16:45.538 --> 16:47.505
What if something's
really wrong?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.774
Oh, Carol, you're fine.

16:49.776 --> 16:53.411
But you don't really
know that for sure, do you?

16:54.613 --> 16:56.647
So the homeowner
then opens the door,

16:56.649 --> 16:59.851
he sees the bag burning,
he stomps on it,

16:59.853 --> 17:01.853
and his foot gets just
covered in dog poop.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.988
Now, since all dogs
are dead now,

17:03.990 --> 17:05.690
instead of dog poop,
I used my own.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.958
TODD (slurring):
Trick or treat!

17:06.960 --> 17:09.527

17:32.719 --> 17:35.219
You know how many clubs
I stood outside of

17:35.221 --> 17:37.488

17:37.490 --> 17:40.558

17:45.999 --> 17:48.066
All of the hot Baltimore clubs.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.700
They all spat in my face.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.735
That's cool.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.336
'Cause I'll tell
you what, bud.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.872
I refuse to let you
or anybody else

17:54.874 --> 17:57.575
keep me outside
of your phony velvet rope.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.744
(chuckles)
Hey, Jasper,

17:59.746 --> 18:01.012
you remember how I said
that Melissa

18:01.014 --> 18:02.080
was rehearsing for a role?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.715
Well, Todd is helping her out

18:04.717 --> 18:08.186
by playing an over-the-top,
drunken buffoon.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.088
Oh, come on, Tandy,
stop it with the lies, okay?

18:10.090 --> 18:12.356
This kid-- Jasper,
you deserve the truth.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.192
Melissa's sick.
That's the truth.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.227
And I'm legitimately drunk,
bud...

18:16.229 --> 18:17.228
Todd.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.262
None of this is real.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.697
Everybody knows it. Everybody.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.099
Oh, that's it.
Get the hell out of here.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.100
You make me.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.267
You make me get out.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.602
Oh, you want to go?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.437
I thought you'd never ask.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.705
Oh, so you do want to go?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.774
I'd love to go. The question is:
do you want to go?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.542
I was the one
who proposed it, Todd.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.577
You want to go?

18:32.579 --> 18:33.778
I just freaking confirmed it.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.946
I do want to go.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.614
Then let's go outside and go.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.782
Then let's go, go.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.317
Let's go!

18:39.319 --> 18:41.385
Are they gonna go?
I think they went.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.124
Come on!
Oh, I'm coming on!

18:46.126 --> 18:48.092
Bring it bud.
Yeah, I will bring it!

18:48.094 --> 18:49.460
How about right here?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.561
Not afraid of you!

18:50.563 --> 18:52.430
CAROL: Stop it!
Push me a-frigging-gain.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.598
Tandy, stop it!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.999
No, I can't do that, Carol.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.968
I made a verbal commitment
to do this.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.636
Then you stop it, Todd.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.638
I'm part of that commitment,
Erica!

19:00.640 --> 19:02.607
You both should be committed.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.841
This guy ruined a kid's party!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.143
And probably his life.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.310
You're a bigot!

19:06.312 --> 19:08.579
Or am I a hero?
Y'all fight like a couple

19:08.581 --> 19:10.915
of straight-up chumps.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.750
Hey, Tandy, soup's on. Huh?

19:12.752 --> 19:13.751
Tonight's special:

19:13.753 --> 19:15.987
cream of your face.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.591
Oh, really? 'Cause I heard
it was Todd-mato soup! Burn.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.126
That sucked, dude.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.828
Oh, take that back.
Make me!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.263
You don't want to know
what's gonna happen
Come on!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.664
if you don't take
that back right now!
Let me see!

19:26.666 --> 19:28.666
Take it back!
I want to see! Come on!

19:28.668 --> 19:30.501
(screams)

19:30.503 --> 19:32.303
(shouts)
Stop it!

19:32.305 --> 19:33.437
(screaming)

19:33.439 --> 19:34.839
Party's over!
Say good night, bud!

19:34.841 --> 19:36.107
No! No!

19:36.109 --> 19:38.142
Stop this insanity!

19:38.144 --> 19:40.511
(siren whooping)

19:40.513 --> 19:42.513
What the hell?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.525
(whooping continues)

20:02.334 --> 20:04.202
Oh, my God.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.938
(Jasper and Melissa laughing)

20:09.141 --> 20:11.309
Todd, he's laughing.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.311
Yeah. Look at 'em.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.013
(laughter continues)

20:16.015 --> 20:19.150
It's been a while
since I've seen her smile.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.387
I'm sorry, bud.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.556
Guess I over-cranked
a little bit.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.058
I totally get it.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.393
You were just trying
to protect Jasper.

20:29.395 --> 20:33.397
I'm sorry
for busting up your party.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.334
I guess whiskey and<i> Milk</i>
don't mix.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.202
You're drinking whiskey
and milk?

20:38.204 --> 20:40.504
No, I drank whiskey and
watched the movie<i> Milk.</i>

20:40.506 --> 20:41.906
Ah.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.408
Hey, get in here,

20:44.410 --> 20:45.910
(chuckling)

20:45.912 --> 20:47.878
What were we doing?
I don't know.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.414
Look, it's a shooting star.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.684
Oh, it's a big one.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.952
ERICA:
Wow.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.925
