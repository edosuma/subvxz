05:21.029 --> 05:22.739

05:26.367 --> 05:29.663

05:29.704 --> 05:31.748
our country's history.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.001

05:31.790 --> 05:34.001
wanted to go to a school

05:31.790 --> 05:34.001
that had that history.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
And, you know, UNC was

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
the first public school,

05:36.419 --> 05:38.379
and they had so much in its

05:36.419 --> 05:38.379

05:38.421 --> 05:39.840
of activism and

05:52.727 --> 05:54.771
in my class to letter.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.025
I lettered in cross country.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.025
And then I played soccer.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.068
I was basically

05:58.066 --> 06:00.068
a straight-A student,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.403
graduated third

06:00.110 --> 06:02.403

06:02.445 --> 06:04.239

06:02.445 --> 06:04.239
I would go somewhere in-state,

06:04.281 --> 06:07.326

06:04.281 --> 06:07.326
was the best school.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.454
a good time there.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.209

06:15.250 --> 06:18.837

06:15.250 --> 06:18.837
I made some of

06:15.250 --> 06:18.837
my best friends,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.340
and we're still really,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.340
really close

06:18.879 --> 06:21.340
to this day.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.384
But two of us were

06:23.466 --> 06:25.384
sexually assaulted

06:25.426 --> 06:27.386
before classes

06:25.426 --> 06:27.386
had even started.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.975
It was at night, um...

06:32.017 --> 06:34.978
We were dancing.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.978
I was out with some friends.

06:35.020 --> 06:39.191
People were drinking,

06:35.020 --> 06:39.191
but nobody was

06:35.020 --> 06:39.191
ridiculously drunk.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.693
And I got pulled

06:39.233 --> 06:41.693
outside and, um,

06:41.735 --> 06:42.986
banged my head

06:41.735 --> 06:42.986
against a wall,

06:43.028 --> 06:44.738
and was raped.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.286
I physically fought

06:48.449 --> 06:51.286
and got away and ran,

06:51.328 --> 06:54.873
and then went to

06:51.328 --> 06:54.873
the bathroom and,

06:51.328 --> 06:54.873
like, I still remember

06:54.915 --> 06:56.750
just putting my

06:54.915 --> 06:56.750
hands on the sink

06:56.791 --> 06:58.501
and just looking at

06:56.791 --> 06:58.501
myself in the mirror,

06:58.543 --> 07:00.128
shaking, like,

06:58.543 --> 07:00.128
"What just happened?"

07:04.883 --> 07:06.885
ANDREA:   My sophomore year,

07:04.883 --> 07:06.885
right after spring break,

07:06.927 --> 07:08.303
a really good

07:06.927 --> 07:08.303
friend of mine said,

07:08.345 --> 07:10.805
"You want to go

07:08.345 --> 07:10.805
to this party?"

07:10.847 --> 07:14.434
and it was pretty

07:10.847 --> 07:14.434
late in the night.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.061
I started dancing

07:14.475 --> 07:16.061
with this guy.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.312
He was

07:16.103 --> 07:17.312
really attractive

07:17.354 --> 07:19.064
and a really, really

07:17.354 --> 07:19.064
great dancer

07:19.106 --> 07:20.315
and just a really

07:19.106 --> 07:20.315
good person.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.441
At least,

07:20.357 --> 07:21.441
I thought he was.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.946
It all happened

07:23.484 --> 07:25.946
really quickly.

07:25.987 --> 07:30.158
I was actually a virgin,

07:25.987 --> 07:30.158
so that adds a bit to it,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.327
but, um, he just

07:30.200 --> 07:32.327
started kind of, like,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.454
pulling me

07:32.369 --> 07:34.454
towards the bathroom.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.417
He grabbed my head

07:36.248 --> 07:38.417
by the side of my ear

07:38.458 --> 07:40.501
and slammed it

07:38.458 --> 07:40.501
against the bathroom tile.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.298
And it didn't stop.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.344
I couldn't move.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.054
I could hear the laughter

07:49.386 --> 07:51.054
outside the door.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.432
I could hear

07:51.096 --> 07:53.432
the people dancing.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.976
And it made me wonder,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.976
why does nobody see me?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.270
Why has nobody

07:56.017 --> 07:58.270
come to the bathroom?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.064
Why am I not screaming?

08:02.983 --> 08:06.527
When you're scared,

08:02.983 --> 08:06.527
when you don't know

08:02.983 --> 08:06.527
what's happening to you,

08:06.569 --> 08:10.240
you just stay there

08:06.569 --> 08:10.240
and you hope

08:06.569 --> 08:10.240
that you don't die.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.492
And that's what

08:10.282 --> 08:12.492
I was hoping,

08:12.533 --> 08:14.494
that I had more

08:12.533 --> 08:14.494
than just 20 years to live.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.835
We've known for

08:19.207 --> 08:21.835
probably 25 years now

08:21.876 --> 08:24.087
that the problem

08:21.876 --> 08:24.087
of sexual assault

08:24.129 --> 08:27.507
on college

08:24.129 --> 08:27.507
campuses is enormous.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.844
DANIELLE DIRKS:   On college

08:27.548 --> 08:30.844
campuses, it is not the person

08:27.548 --> 08:30.844
jumping out of the bushes

08:30.885 --> 08:34.472
or in the parking

08:30.885 --> 08:34.472
lot who is going to

08:30.885 --> 08:34.472
rape or sexually assault you.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.475
It is the person

08:34.514 --> 08:36.475
whom you know,

08:36.515 --> 08:38.268
the person you may

08:36.515 --> 08:38.268
have classes with,

08:38.309 --> 08:39.519
the person you

08:38.309 --> 08:39.519
see at a party.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.273
You think about

08:41.188 --> 08:43.273
it's the people

08:41.188 --> 08:43.273
we don't know

08:43.315 --> 08:44.774
that we should

08:43.315 --> 08:44.774
be worried about,

08:44.816 --> 08:46.318
but it's really

08:44.816 --> 08:46.318
the people you do know

08:46.360 --> 08:48.987
that you should

08:46.360 --> 08:48.987
be worried about.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.655
JOHN FOUBERT:   But I think

08:49.029 --> 08:50.655
a lot of parents think,

08:50.697 --> 08:52.573
"Well, we'll drop

08:50.697 --> 08:52.573
our daughter off,

08:52.615 --> 08:55.076
"she'll have a great

08:52.615 --> 08:55.076
college experience,

08:55.118 --> 08:58.163
"and everything will

08:55.118 --> 08:58.163
be fine because the

08:55.118 --> 08:58.163
college has a reputation

08:58.205 --> 08:59.456
"for being a safe place."

08:59.831 --> 09:01.500
Um...

09:01.541 --> 09:02.542
It's not.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.975
ANDREA:   I learned later

09:16.931 --> 09:18.975
on that I wasn't the only

09:19.017 --> 09:22.020
one who was

09:19.017 --> 09:22.020
raped that weekend.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.356
But at the time,

09:22.062 --> 09:24.356
we didn't talk about it

09:24.398 --> 09:27.942
because it was something

09:24.398 --> 09:27.942
that nobody talked about.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.154
Rape's a scary word.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.154
You don't want to

09:27.984 --> 09:31.154
fall into a category.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.781
You don't want to

09:31.196 --> 09:33.781
be called the victim.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.576
I did not want to admit

09:33.823 --> 09:36.576
that it happened to me.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.666
ANNIE:   I didn't tell anybody

09:40.080 --> 09:43.666
for a really long time.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.295
I went to classes, um,

09:43.708 --> 09:47.295
did everything

09:43.708 --> 09:47.295
kind of normally,

09:47.337 --> 09:50.549
and it was just something

09:47.337 --> 09:50.549
in the back of my mind

09:50.590 --> 09:52.842
and it really

09:50.590 --> 09:52.842
started to affect me.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.678
And I was like,

09:52.884 --> 09:55.678
"I need to do

09:52.884 --> 09:55.678
something about this."

09:55.720 --> 09:57.264
And it actually

09:55.720 --> 09:57.264
wasn't until one of my

09:57.305 --> 09:58.932
other friends

09:57.305 --> 09:58.932
came to me and said,

09:58.973 --> 10:02.018
"I was assaulted

09:58.973 --> 10:02.018
at a fraternity.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.018
How do I report?"

10:02.060 --> 10:04.896
And I said,

10:02.060 --> 10:04.896
"Actually, I don't know."

10:04.938 --> 10:07.524
And I disclosed to her

10:04.938 --> 10:07.524
that I was assaulted, as well,

10:07.566 --> 10:10.735
and we sat down and

10:07.566 --> 10:10.735
just pulled up Google

10:10.777 --> 10:14.030
and started looking up

10:10.777 --> 10:14.030
how to report at UNC.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.657
I knew I was more comfortable

10:14.072 --> 10:16.657
reporting than she was.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.535
So, I said,

10:16.699 --> 10:18.535
"Okay, I'm gonna go report,

10:18.577 --> 10:20.245
"and then I'll

10:18.577 --> 10:20.245
figure out how to do it,

10:20.287 --> 10:23.123
"and then I'll tell you,

10:20.287 --> 10:23.123
and then you can do it too."

10:23.164 --> 10:26.709
So, I told this administrator

10:23.164 --> 10:26.709
I was violently raped,

10:26.751 --> 10:28.711
and we're sitting

10:26.751 --> 10:28.711
down at this point,

10:28.753 --> 10:31.005
and she looks at

10:28.753 --> 10:31.005
me and she's like,

10:31.047 --> 10:32.882
"Rape is like

10:31.047 --> 10:32.882
a football game, Annie,

10:32.924 --> 10:34.884
"and if you look

10:32.924 --> 10:34.884
back on the game,

10:34.926 --> 10:38.805
"what would you do differently

10:34.926 --> 10:38.805
in that situation?"

10:38.846 --> 10:42.016
I was expecting resources.

10:38.846 --> 10:42.016
I was expecting support.

10:42.058 --> 10:46.896
And instead she gives me

10:42.058 --> 10:46.896
this metaphor that

10:42.058 --> 10:46.896
rape is football.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.649
And it made no sense.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.649
And I ask her... I was just,

10:49.690 --> 10:51.901
"No, rape is not

10:49.690 --> 10:51.901
like football at all!"

10:51.943 --> 10:54.195
And she's like, "Well,

10:51.943 --> 10:54.195
you know, were you drunk?"

10:54.237 --> 10:56.406
And, "What would you

10:54.237 --> 10:56.406
have done differently

10:56.448 --> 10:58.492
"if you could replay

10:56.448 --> 10:58.492
the situation again?"

10:58.533 --> 11:00.577
And I was just getting blamed

10:58.533 --> 11:00.577
and blamed and

10:58.533 --> 11:00.577
blamed for this.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.500
CRYTAL GIOKAS:

11:03.413 --> 11:06.500
They kept asking me, like,

11:03.413 --> 11:06.500
"What were you wearing?

11:06.541 --> 11:09.586
"What were you drinking? How

11:06.541 --> 11:09.586
much did you have to drink?

11:06.541 --> 11:09.586
Did you pregame?"

11:09.628 --> 11:11.004
He kind of just

11:09.628 --> 11:11.004
lectured us about

11:11.045 --> 11:13.798
how we shouldn't go

11:11.045 --> 11:13.798
out in short skirts.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.093
And we shouldn't drink

11:13.840 --> 11:17.093
because, I mean, that's

11:13.840 --> 11:17.093
our fault.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.595
"Did you say no?

11:18.637 --> 11:21.431
"How many times

11:18.637 --> 11:21.431
did you say no?

11:18.637 --> 11:21.431
How did you say it?

11:21.473 --> 11:22.307
"Okay, what were you wearing?"

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
There was no response.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.311
There was no response

11:24.058 --> 11:26.311
for seven months.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.687
I thought that if I told them,

11:26.353 --> 11:28.687
they would take action.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.275
But the only action

11:30.106 --> 11:32.275
they took was against me.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.568
After I was

11:32.317 --> 11:33.568
sexually assaulted,

11:33.610 --> 11:35.028
they said I

11:33.610 --> 11:35.028
should just drop out

11:35.069 --> 11:36.363
until everything blows over.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.073
Out of school.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.285
I went back into her office,

11:39.115 --> 11:42.285
and I asked her what happened.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.580
She looked me right in the eye

11:42.327 --> 11:45.580
and told me that she forgot.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.915
The school's response

11:45.622 --> 11:47.915
always seemed like

11:47.957 --> 11:50.126
they were more concerned

11:47.957 --> 11:50.126
about him and his needs.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.710
She said, uh,

11:51.752 --> 11:54.214
"You don't know what

11:51.752 --> 11:54.214
he's going through right now

11:54.255 --> 11:56.715
"He could be really

11:54.255 --> 11:56.715
having a hard time."

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
They also told me,

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
despite the fact that I had

11:59.760 --> 12:02.514
a written admission

11:59.760 --> 12:02.514
of guilt from him,

12:02.556 --> 12:04.849
that I didn't have enough

12:02.556 --> 12:04.849
evidence and that, in fact,

12:04.891 --> 12:07.394
what I'd presented to them

12:07.435 --> 12:08.811
could only prove

12:07.435 --> 12:08.811
that he loved me.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.817
There's a lot of

12:11.898 --> 12:14.817
victim-blaming

12:11.898 --> 12:14.817
with this crime,

12:14.859 --> 12:16.735
which has a silencing

12:14.859 --> 12:16.735
effect on survivors.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.373
If a student comes

12:24.827 --> 12:28.373
to an administrator

12:24.827 --> 12:28.373
with a problem,

12:28.415 --> 12:29.624
it's not as if

12:28.415 --> 12:29.624
the administrator

12:29.666 --> 12:31.710
wants that

12:29.666 --> 12:31.710
student to be harmed.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.836
It's not as if

12:31.750 --> 12:33.836
the administrator

12:33.878 --> 12:36.297
wants the harm

12:33.878 --> 12:36.297
to be perpetuated,

12:36.339 --> 12:39.175
but their first job is to

12:36.339 --> 12:39.175
protect the institution

12:36.339 --> 12:39.175
from harm,

12:39.217 --> 12:40.552
not the student from harm.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.137
What you do is you

12:40.594 --> 12:43.137
make it difficult

12:40.594 --> 12:43.137
for students to report,

12:43.179 --> 12:45.848
so you don't have 200

12:43.179 --> 12:45.848
or a thousand

12:43.179 --> 12:45.848
reported assaults,

12:45.890 --> 12:47.975
or whatever the number

12:45.890 --> 12:47.975
would be on that campus.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.562
So, you can artificially keep

12:48.017 --> 12:50.562
your numbers low.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.149
One really easy way,

12:52.063 --> 12:55.149
when a lot of students report,

12:55.191 --> 12:57.985
they very much discourage them

12:55.191 --> 12:57.985
from going to the police.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.113
And that's because

12:58.027 --> 13:00.113
if it goes to the police,

13:00.154 --> 13:02.115
then it's more likely to

13:00.154 --> 13:02.115
end up as a public record.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.660
CLAIRE BOND POTTER:

13:03.866 --> 13:05.660
Colleges have been

13:05.702 --> 13:07.412
mandated for a long

13:05.702 --> 13:07.412
time to report the crimes

13:07.454 --> 13:10.331
that occur on campus

13:07.454 --> 13:10.331
to the federal government.

13:10.373 --> 13:14.001
But it is in

13:10.373 --> 13:14.001
the interest of the college

13:10.373 --> 13:14.001
to actually suppress

13:14.043 --> 13:16.713
all knowledge that

13:14.043 --> 13:16.713
that rape has happened.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.519
There is a desire to have this

13:27.390 --> 13:31.519
addressed internally.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.773
And part of that is silencing

13:31.561 --> 13:34.773
the kind of problem.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.191
It's viewed as

13:34.855 --> 13:37.191
a public relations

13:37.233 --> 13:39.860
management kind of a problem,

13:37.233 --> 13:39.860
I would say.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.363
Universities are

13:39.902 --> 13:42.363
protecting a brand.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.198
They're selling a product.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.824
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:10.642 --> 14:12.101
KAMILAH WILLINGHAM:

14:10.642 --> 14:12.101
I got a call from

14:12.143 --> 14:15.021
the Dean of Admissions first,

14:12.143 --> 14:15.021
asking, you know...

14:15.062 --> 14:17.357
"If you were to

14:15.062 --> 14:17.357
get into Harvard,

14:15.062 --> 14:17.357
would you accept?"

14:17.398 --> 14:18.857
And I said yes

14:17.398 --> 14:18.857
because I knew my mom

14:18.899 --> 14:20.485
would kill me if I

14:18.899 --> 14:20.485
said anything else.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.695
But... (LAUGHS)

14:23.321 --> 14:26.949
I had mentioned

14:23.321 --> 14:26.949
a little pressure.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.949
Just a little.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.160
You know, I saw it as

14:26.991 --> 14:29.160
a great opportunity.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.746
You know,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.746
a Harvard law degree. Wow.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.793
KAMILAH WILLINGHAM:

14:35.375 --> 14:36.793
I saw the inside

14:35.375 --> 14:36.793
of a court room

14:36.835 --> 14:37.918
during my second

14:36.835 --> 14:37.918
year of law school.

14:39.629 --> 14:45.134
It was insanely stressful,

14:39.629 --> 14:45.134
but also super rewarding.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.887
So, yeah, I really loved

14:45.176 --> 14:47.887
my second year there.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.893
It was during the winter term

14:50.223 --> 14:53.893
of my third year.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.270
I knew him really well.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.899
We'd met a couple

14:56.312 --> 14:59.899
of years earlier.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.819
The guy, and my

14:59.940 --> 15:02.819
girlfriend who was over,

15:02.861 --> 15:06.030
we all met at my apartment

15:02.861 --> 15:06.030
to have some

15:02.861 --> 15:06.030
drinks beforehand,

15:06.072 --> 15:08.616
and then we went

15:06.072 --> 15:08.616
out to this bar.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.786
He continued to buy

15:08.658 --> 15:11.786
us both more drinks.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.706
Half an hour

15:12.953 --> 15:14.706
into it, I noticed

15:14.748 --> 15:16.957
my girlfriend seemed wasted.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.957
(LAUGHS)

15:18.626 --> 15:22.797
People started to comment on

15:18.626 --> 15:22.797
how drunk my friend seemed.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.344
Almost instantly

15:25.216 --> 15:28.344
after we got into the taxi,

15:28.386 --> 15:31.598
I just felt this extremely

15:28.386 --> 15:31.598
heavy feeling come over me.

15:34.016 --> 15:39.230
My friend, she was just

15:34.016 --> 15:39.230
kind of passed out completely.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.275
It was,

15:39.272 --> 15:42.275
like, a maybe 10-minute

15:39.272 --> 15:42.275
ride back to my place.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.987
Me and my girlfriend

15:44.026 --> 15:46.987
kind of just flopped down,

15:47.029 --> 15:48.656
face first on my bed.

15:50.324 --> 15:55.830
The next thing I remember,

15:50.324 --> 15:55.830
he, um, was on top of me

15:55.872 --> 16:00.084
and he had a hand

15:55.872 --> 16:00.084
inside of my underwear

16:00.126 --> 16:02.336
and he was trying to put

16:00.126 --> 16:02.336
a finger inside of me.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.173
I yanked him by the hair,

16:03.963 --> 16:06.173
and I looked

16:06.215 --> 16:08.885
over and I just

16:06.215 --> 16:08.885
saw her naked back,

16:08.927 --> 16:13.514
and I know that

16:08.927 --> 16:13.514
she'd fallen asleep

16:08.927 --> 16:13.514
with all of her clothes on.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.559
And so, my next question was,

16:13.556 --> 16:16.559
"Why is she naked?"

16:16.601 --> 16:17.936
Um...

16:17.977 --> 16:20.438
And he smiled as he was

16:17.977 --> 16:20.438
still on top of me,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.941
fondling me with one hand,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.941
and he reached out

16:22.982 --> 16:24.859
and pet her

16:22.982 --> 16:24.859
naked belly and said,

16:24.901 --> 16:27.278
"I did that. I undressed her."

16:27.320 --> 16:29.363
And I asked, you know,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.363
"You took off her bra?"

16:29.405 --> 16:32.283
Then, he...

16:32.325 --> 16:36.537
He touched her naked breast,

16:32.325 --> 16:36.537
while she was still

16:32.325 --> 16:36.537
totally unconscious,

16:36.579 --> 16:37.914
and said,

16:36.579 --> 16:37.914
"Yeah, I did that, too."

16:39.791 --> 16:41.793
And the next day he texted me.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.004
And I said something

16:41.835 --> 16:45.004
very casually, like,

16:45.045 --> 16:48.174
"Am I gonna have to tell her

16:45.045 --> 16:48.174
that she needs

16:45.045 --> 16:48.174
a pregnancy test?"

16:48.215 --> 16:50.593
And he said in

16:48.215 --> 16:50.593
the text message,

16:50.635 --> 16:52.553
"No, we didn't do

16:50.635 --> 16:52.553
anything serious.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.890
"Maybe I put

16:52.595 --> 16:55.890
a finger in her v at most."

16:59.310 --> 17:03.564
APRIL:   It seemed pretty

16:59.310 --> 17:03.564
clear that he had

16:59.310 --> 17:03.564
assaulted both of them

17:03.606 --> 17:05.733
while they were unconscious.

17:05.775 --> 17:10.530
I absolutely

17:05.775 --> 17:10.530
presumed that Harvard

17:05.775 --> 17:10.530
would do right by Kamilah.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.285
I went to the Dean

17:13.115 --> 17:16.285
of Students' office,

17:13.115 --> 17:16.285
and she said,

17:16.327 --> 17:19.204
"I just want to make sure,

17:16.327 --> 17:19.204
above all else,

17:19.246 --> 17:22.541
"that you don't talk

17:19.246 --> 17:22.541
to anyone about this.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.752
"It could be bad for everyone

17:22.583 --> 17:25.752
if people

17:22.583 --> 17:25.752
started rallying around

17:25.795 --> 17:27.128
"having him

17:25.795 --> 17:27.128
removed from campus."

17:27.171 --> 17:31.634
I was like... (LAUGHS)

17:27.171 --> 17:31.634
"Well, he's a predator,

17:31.676 --> 17:33.970
"and he's dangerous,

17:31.676 --> 17:33.970
and actually that's

17:31.676 --> 17:33.970
exactly what I want."

17:36.639 --> 17:39.684
KAMILAH:   We both had the right

17:36.639 --> 17:39.684
to legal representation.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.394
My lawyer was pro bono.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.315
COLBY BRUNO:

17:43.897 --> 17:46.315
She was a phenomenal client.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.986
She really told her story

17:46.357 --> 17:49.986
with a great

17:46.357 --> 17:49.986
deal of confidence.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.321
KAMILAH:

17:50.987 --> 17:52.321
I went into the hearing

17:52.363 --> 17:53.823
and even

17:52.363 --> 17:53.823
the professors were like,

17:53.865 --> 17:56.283
"Did I give him

17:53.865 --> 17:56.283
the wrong message

17:53.865 --> 17:56.283
with our friendship

17:56.325 --> 17:58.077
"and that he misunderstood

17:56.325 --> 17:58.077
our friendship."

17:59.286 --> 18:02.623
My response was like,

17:59.286 --> 18:02.623
"No, because, you know,

18:02.665 --> 18:06.252
"sex was never part

18:02.665 --> 18:06.252
of that friendship.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.547
"And if it were ever going

18:06.293 --> 18:09.547
to be introduced,

18:09.589 --> 18:11.591
"when I was awake

18:09.589 --> 18:11.591
would be a good

18:09.589 --> 18:11.591
time for that."

18:13.593 --> 18:17.055
I'm getting questions like,

18:13.593 --> 18:17.055
"Why didn't you fight him?"

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
And he's like,

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
I think like 6'3",

18:17.096 --> 18:21.100
over 200 pounds.

18:22.184 --> 18:26.022
I was unconscious

18:22.184 --> 18:26.022
or just coming to.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.816
I, like, could barely

18:26.064 --> 18:28.816
take control of my own body.

18:28.858 --> 18:29.817
But,

18:28.858 --> 18:29.817
"Why didn't you fight him?"

18:31.527 --> 18:34.697
There was this extreme

18:31.527 --> 18:34.697
reluctance to believe me.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.534
DANIELLE:   Campus

18:36.449 --> 18:38.534
administrators are overly

18:38.576 --> 18:41.079
concerned about

18:38.576 --> 18:41.079
false reporting.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.456
You look at

18:41.120 --> 18:43.456
statistics on false reporting.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.375
It's much, much smaller than

18:43.497 --> 18:46.375
what people estimate it to be.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.961
The data about

18:46.417 --> 18:47.961
false rape claims

18:48.002 --> 18:51.213
is that they're

18:48.002 --> 18:51.213
a tiny minority

18:48.002 --> 18:51.213
of all reports ever made.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.800
Rape and sexual assault

18:51.255 --> 18:53.800
have the same

18:53.841 --> 18:55.676
percentage of false reports

18:55.718 --> 18:58.178
that any other crime

18:55.718 --> 18:58.178
has in our country.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.390
The best research

18:58.220 --> 19:01.390
from around the world

19:01.432 --> 19:04.811
would put the percentage

19:01.432 --> 19:04.811
of false reports

19:01.432 --> 19:04.811
somewhere between two and 8%.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.608
Which means 90%

19:10.650 --> 19:14.695
but more likely 95

19:10.650 --> 19:14.695
to 98% of reports,

19:10.650 --> 19:14.695
are not false.

19:16.948 --> 19:21.119
We got done with the hearing

19:16.948 --> 19:21.119
probably at 4:30 or 5:00.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.287
And they came

19:21.160 --> 19:23.287
back very quickly.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.165
They'd found that

19:23.329 --> 19:26.165
he had assaulted me.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.919
COLBY:   When we got the call

19:27.583 --> 19:29.919
that he was expelled,

19:29.961 --> 19:31.796
she was in utter disbelief.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.173
And that doesn't

19:31.838 --> 19:34.173
come very often

19:31.838 --> 19:34.173
with these college cases.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.179
KAMILAH:   The next September,

19:36.717 --> 19:40.179
I came back to Cambridge,

19:40.220 --> 19:42.640
and I got a Facebook message

19:40.220 --> 19:42.640
from the Dean of Students.

19:44.642 --> 19:50.272
She said that the assailant,

19:44.642 --> 19:50.272
he could appeal

19:44.642 --> 19:50.272
the ad board's decision,

19:50.314 --> 19:53.609
and they voted again

19:50.314 --> 19:53.609
on whether to uphold

19:53.651 --> 19:55.069
the decision to remove him

19:55.111 --> 19:56.821
and decided to

19:55.111 --> 19:56.821
let him back in.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.755
COLBY:   The message is clear.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.508
It's, "Don't proceed through

20:14.797 --> 20:17.508
these disciplinary hearings.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.220
"No matter what you do,

20:18.843 --> 20:21.220
you're not gonna win."

21:24.825 --> 21:26.452
ANDREA:   I was like,

21:24.825 --> 21:26.452
"Well, you know what?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.452
I'm okay.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.079
"And I've never had

21:26.493 --> 21:28.079
anything happen to me,

21:26.493 --> 21:28.079
and I'm fine.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.289
"I'm gonna get through this."

21:30.330 --> 21:32.458
But I started

21:30.330 --> 21:32.458
feeling different.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.934
Not only was my mind

21:47.056 --> 21:49.934
in a place of turmoil,

21:49.976 --> 21:52.561
my body was, as well.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.563
I had nightmares

21:52.603 --> 21:54.563
that were so vivid

21:52.603 --> 21:54.563
that I would wake up

21:54.605 --> 21:57.399
and my neck was

21:54.605 --> 21:57.399
bleeding of how much

21:54.605 --> 21:57.399
I was scratching off

21:57.441 --> 21:58.985
that invisible

21:57.441 --> 21:58.985
rapist on my neck again.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.454
So, finally, when it became

22:08.244 --> 22:10.454
very overwhelming,

22:10.496 --> 22:13.332
I knew that I couldn't

22:10.496 --> 22:13.332
keep denying it anymore.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.378
So, actually,

22:15.793 --> 22:18.378
the first person I told

22:15.793 --> 22:18.378
was Annie Clark.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.506
She was a senior

22:18.420 --> 22:20.506
when I was a first year.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.926
I kind of facebooked her

22:20.547 --> 22:23.926
and I said, you know,

22:23.968 --> 22:25.343
"Can I talk to you

22:23.968 --> 22:25.343
about something?"

22:28.931 --> 22:31.391
Hey, it's Annie.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.391
Yeah, how are you doing?

22:31.433 --> 22:32.893
ANDREA:

22:31.433 --> 22:32.893
I mean, we just hit it off.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.895
Oh, my gosh.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.106
ANDREA:   She,

22:34.937 --> 22:37.106
till this day, has been my

22:34.937 --> 22:37.106
greatest support system.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.357
Are you in a place...

22:37.148 --> 22:39.357
Do you feel comfortable

22:37.148 --> 22:39.357
talking about it, or...

22:40.484 --> 22:41.694
ANDREA:

22:40.484 --> 22:41.694
After I spoke to Annie,

22:41.735 --> 22:44.030
I came out publicly

22:41.735 --> 22:44.030
to the entire campus

22:44.071 --> 22:46.364
in October of

22:44.071 --> 22:46.364
my sophomore year

22:46.406 --> 22:47.992
with a project called

22:46.406 --> 22:47.992
the Courage Project,

22:48.034 --> 22:50.536
which was a photo project

22:48.034 --> 22:50.536
of survivors on campus.

22:52.496 --> 22:57.126
As I became more public,

22:52.496 --> 22:57.126
I became kind of

22:52.496 --> 22:57.126
that gateway for people

22:57.168 --> 22:59.712
to actually

22:57.168 --> 22:59.712
start talking about

22:57.168 --> 22:59.712
what had happened to them.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.864
Within four weeks,

23:23.652 --> 23:26.864
I met nine rape

23:23.652 --> 23:26.864
survivors at UNC.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.617
My school needed to know

23:28.824 --> 23:30.617
this was a problem,

23:30.659 --> 23:32.036
and I thought

23:30.659 --> 23:32.036
that they honestly

23:30.659 --> 23:32.036
just didn't know.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.749
I made meetings with

23:34.955 --> 23:36.749
the Vice-Chancellor,

23:36.790 --> 23:38.209
and I made meetings

23:36.790 --> 23:38.209
with the Dean of Students,

23:38.251 --> 23:40.961
and they were passed off

23:38.251 --> 23:40.961
and ignored and delayed.

23:41.003 --> 23:44.798
And I kept saying,

23:41.003 --> 23:44.798
"UNC has a problem

23:41.003 --> 23:44.798
with sexual assault."

23:44.840 --> 23:47.885
I had the same meeting with

23:44.840 --> 23:47.885
the Chancellor four years ago,

23:47.927 --> 23:50.304
and it's like as

23:47.927 --> 23:50.304
soon as there's

23:47.927 --> 23:50.304
a new cycle of students,

23:50.346 --> 23:51.764
there's no

23:50.346 --> 23:51.764
institutional memory,

23:51.805 --> 23:53.140
and the problem

23:51.805 --> 23:53.140
starts all over again.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.850
And so, unless you have...

23:54.892 --> 23:57.644
To see it happen

23:54.892 --> 23:57.644
with my friends

23:54.892 --> 23:57.644
going through the same thing

23:57.686 --> 24:01.232
I experienced six years ago,

23:57.686 --> 24:01.232
it's heartbreaking.

24:01.274 --> 24:05.694
And it's...

24:01.274 --> 24:05.694
That has affected me

24:01.274 --> 24:05.694
more than my own rape.

24:05.736 --> 24:08.572
People stop talking about it,

24:05.736 --> 24:08.572
and then it just continues

24:08.614 --> 24:12.243
and then it makes you wonder,

24:08.614 --> 24:12.243
what is it gonna take?

24:12.285 --> 24:14.494
ANNIE:   And we started working

24:12.285 --> 24:14.494
with Dean Melinda Manning,

24:14.536 --> 24:18.165
who was somebody

24:14.536 --> 24:18.165
who a lot of survivors

24:14.536 --> 24:18.165
have worked with and trusted.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.000
INTERVIEWER:

24:18.207 --> 24:20.000
So, in your time at UNC,

24:20.042 --> 24:22.128
how many students came to you

24:20.042 --> 24:22.128
and said they'd

24:20.042 --> 24:22.128
been assaulted?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.170
Um...

24:24.797 --> 24:27.591
Yeah, it's hard to put

24:24.797 --> 24:27.591
a number on it, so...

24:28.592 --> 24:29.467
At least a hundred.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.346
INTERVIEWER:

24:31.011 --> 24:32.346
And of the hundred,

24:32.388 --> 24:35.224
how many of the perpetrators

24:32.388 --> 24:35.224
were removed from campus?

24:35.266 --> 24:38.185
From what I remember,

24:35.266 --> 24:38.185
no one was

24:35.266 --> 24:38.185
expelled during that time.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.271
So, these guys could

24:38.227 --> 24:40.271
just get away with it?

24:40.313 --> 24:42.273
Absolutely. Absolutely.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.318
And people could

24:42.315 --> 24:45.318
commit it repeatedly.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.362
I was certainly

24:45.359 --> 24:48.362
aware of some individuals

24:48.404 --> 24:50.656
who had committed it

24:48.404 --> 24:50.656
repeatedly.

24:53.117 --> 24:57.204
CAROLINE HELDMAN:

24:53.117 --> 24:57.204
A survivor at Occidental

24:53.117 --> 24:57.204
College contacted me.

24:57.246 --> 25:01.459
I noticed that her

24:57.246 --> 25:01.459
rapist's name matched

24:57.246 --> 25:01.459
the name of two other cases.

25:01.499 --> 25:04.211
So, she was the third student

25:01.499 --> 25:04.211
to be raped by this student.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.425
Um, and the most

25:05.629 --> 25:09.425
troubling aspect of this case

25:09.467 --> 25:14.888
is that he was allowed back,

25:09.467 --> 25:14.888
or is allowed to

25:09.467 --> 25:14.888
come back onto campus.

25:14.930 --> 25:18.476
I thought it was only one,

25:14.930 --> 25:18.476
but now I know

25:14.930 --> 25:18.476
there's two other women.

25:18.516 --> 25:22.813
And who knows who else

25:18.516 --> 25:22.813
who just wasn't

25:18.516 --> 25:22.813
able to step forward.

25:22.855 --> 25:27.234
LEAH TRUJILLO:   It seemed like

25:22.855 --> 25:27.234
prime hunting ground

25:22.855 --> 25:27.234
for someone like him.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.279
HOPE BRINN:

25:27.276 --> 25:30.279
My assailant, he's done

25:27.276 --> 25:30.279
much worse to other people.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.530
He has assaulted

25:30.321 --> 25:32.530
at least four different women.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.451
That's just who I know of.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.451
(SCOFFS)

25:35.493 --> 25:37.703
About two weeks

25:35.493 --> 25:37.703
after I reported,

25:37.744 --> 25:41.581
I got a call from

25:37.744 --> 25:41.581
the detective saying

25:41.623 --> 25:47.629
that they found

25:41.623 --> 25:47.629
two other girls

25:41.623 --> 25:47.629
that he had previously raped.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.800
And they were both

25:47.671 --> 25:51.800
University of Tulsa students,

25:51.842 --> 25:54.552
and they had both

25:51.842 --> 25:54.552
reported to the school.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.227
DAVID LISAK:   The vast

25:58.224 --> 26:01.227
majority of men don't rape,

26:01.268 --> 26:04.313
won't rape, haven't raped.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.023
So, when you start

26:04.355 --> 26:06.023
looking at then

26:06.065 --> 26:08.025
the rapists who are

26:06.065 --> 26:08.025
committing these crimes,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.861
it is the repeat offenders

26:08.067 --> 26:10.861
who are the core

26:08.067 --> 26:10.861
of this problem.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.874
MAN 2:   I was incarcerated

26:20.954 --> 26:23.874
for six and a half

26:20.954 --> 26:23.874
years for sexual assault.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.420
I know I was at fault.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.925
You know, like I said, I guess

26:32.966 --> 26:34.760
the reason I really

26:32.966 --> 26:34.760
wanted to do this interview

26:34.801 --> 26:38.472
was to maybe help

26:34.801 --> 26:38.472
someone else out.

26:38.514 --> 26:42.142
You know, maybe have

26:38.514 --> 26:42.142
them become aware of,

26:42.184 --> 26:44.562
you know,

26:42.184 --> 26:44.562
what they're doing wrong.

26:44.602 --> 26:47.565
DAVID:   The really

26:44.602 --> 26:47.565
practiced sex offenders

26:44.602 --> 26:47.565
identify groups of people

26:47.647 --> 26:49.816
who are more vulnerable.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.819
College is a place where

26:49.858 --> 26:52.819
lots of alcohol's consumed

26:52.861 --> 26:56.031
and, uh, the number

26:52.861 --> 26:56.031
of victims is endless.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.121
DAVID:   These men select

26:58.742 --> 27:02.121
victims ahead of time.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.665
It could be a bar.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.665
It could be a fraternity party

27:02.162 --> 27:05.665
where people are drinking.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.627
MAN 2:   At the parties,

27:07.918 --> 27:09.627
like, frat parties,

27:09.669 --> 27:11.547
I mean,

27:09.669 --> 27:11.547
people are getting wasted.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.632
So, it's not like

27:11.589 --> 27:14.632
a lot of the time,

27:11.589 --> 27:14.632
depending on who they're with,

27:14.674 --> 27:19.637
nobody, um, keeps

27:14.674 --> 27:19.637
an eye on them.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.515
DAVID:   The alcohol is

27:19.679 --> 27:21.515
essentially a weapon

27:21.557 --> 27:26.562
that is used to

27:21.557 --> 27:26.562
render somebody

27:21.557 --> 27:26.562
extremely vulnerable.

27:26.604 --> 27:31.817
MAN 2:   Alcohol

27:26.604 --> 27:31.817
definitely makes it easier

27:26.604 --> 27:31.817
to overpower a victim.

27:31.858 --> 27:37.573
If they're inebriated

27:31.858 --> 27:37.573
or under the influence,

27:31.858 --> 27:37.573
less struggle, for sure.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.450
DAVID:   And then

27:37.615 --> 27:39.450
there's an isolation phase.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.536
So, you know, somebody who

27:39.492 --> 27:42.536
has deliberately

27:39.492 --> 27:42.536
gotten this young woman

27:42.578 --> 27:45.539
extremely intoxicated,

27:42.578 --> 27:45.539
and at some

27:42.578 --> 27:45.539
point he says to her,

27:45.581 --> 27:47.583
"I'll walk you

27:45.581 --> 27:47.583
back to your room."

27:47.625 --> 27:50.461
Or, "You can sleep

27:47.625 --> 27:50.461
it off if you want.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.461
We have a bed upstairs."

27:52.004 --> 27:54.381
And that's where

27:52.004 --> 27:54.381
the assault occurs.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.727
MELINDA:   A lot of people say,

28:07.769 --> 28:09.062
"Why don't they

28:07.769 --> 28:09.062
just have students

28:07.769 --> 28:09.062
go to the police?"

28:10.606 --> 28:12.316
I have a lot of good friends

28:10.606 --> 28:12.316
who are police officers,

28:12.358 --> 28:16.320
and I love them dearly,

28:12.358 --> 28:16.320
but they have some work to do.

28:23.410 --> 28:27.039
Even if law enforcement

28:23.410 --> 28:27.039
does do a good job,

28:27.080 --> 28:28.915
a lot of district attorneys

28:27.080 --> 28:28.915
don't want to

28:27.080 --> 28:28.915
take these cases.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.300
And even if

28:36.256 --> 28:38.300
there is prosecution,

28:38.342 --> 28:39.843
it takes a long time.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.679
It takes a year, two years.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.390
In the meantime,

28:41.720 --> 28:44.390
that alleged perpetrator

28:44.431 --> 28:46.725
could do it again

28:44.431 --> 28:46.725
and again and again.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.770
So, universities,

28:48.143 --> 28:50.770
if they have good evidence

28:50.812 --> 28:53.566
that somebody is perpetrating

28:50.812 --> 28:53.566
that crime on that campus,

28:53.607 --> 28:55.568
they should remove them

28:53.607 --> 28:55.568
to protect their

28:53.607 --> 28:55.568
other students,

28:55.609 --> 28:57.486
with or without the police.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.658
WOMAN 3: No more violence!

29:00.573 --> 29:02.658
ALL: No more rape!

29:02.700 --> 29:04.618
ALL: No more silence!

29:02.700 --> 29:04.618
No more hate!

29:06.286 --> 29:07.913
(CHEERING)

29:11.208 --> 29:13.752
CAROL TRACY:   What we're seeing

29:11.208 --> 29:13.752
today has been going on

29:13.793 --> 29:16.255
for a very long time

29:13.793 --> 29:16.255
on college campuses.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.302
Sexual violence has always

29:19.216 --> 29:22.302
been part of

29:19.216 --> 29:22.302
the college experience.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.221
(BELL TOLLS)

29:24.263 --> 29:27.307
REPORTER 1:

29:24.263 --> 29:27.307
Here at Brown University,

29:24.263 --> 29:27.307
names of men accused of rape

29:27.349 --> 29:30.519
appeared on bathroom walls

29:27.349 --> 29:30.519
all over the campus.

29:32.229 --> 29:35.190
The administration

29:32.229 --> 29:35.190
called the tactic vigilantism.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.402
One student had a word

29:35.232 --> 29:38.402
for the women who did it.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.821
Idiots.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.821
I have a lot of

29:38.444 --> 29:41.821
friends on the list,

29:41.863 --> 29:43.907
and by no means

29:41.863 --> 29:43.907
are they rapists.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.910
They might be aggressive

29:43.949 --> 29:46.910
at parties, flirtatious.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.788
And if girls carry a grudge,

29:46.952 --> 29:49.788
they call them rapists.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.165
And to be saying that

29:49.829 --> 29:52.165
just because a woman says "no"

29:52.207 --> 29:54.793
and because you have sex,

29:54.834 --> 29:57.129
those are the two facts.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.129
The woman said

29:54.834 --> 29:57.129
"no" and you had sex.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.591
Then are you a rapist

29:57.170 --> 30:00.591
automatically because of that?

30:00.633 --> 30:02.259
REPORTER 2:   A national

30:00.633 --> 30:02.259
study says one out of

30:02.301 --> 30:04.637
every four female

30:02.301 --> 30:04.637
college students

30:04.678 --> 30:08.348
will be the victim of a rape

30:04.678 --> 30:08.348
or attempted sexual assault.

30:08.390 --> 30:12.018
The first national

30:08.390 --> 30:12.018
study was done...

30:08.390 --> 30:12.018
Published in 1987.

30:12.060 --> 30:15.814
Mary Koss' survey of colleges

30:12.060 --> 30:15.814
around the country.

30:15.855 --> 30:20.068
And those numbers

30:15.855 --> 30:20.068
have been replicated

30:15.855 --> 30:20.068
over and over again.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.321
Good evening.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.321
As troubling as

30:20.110 --> 30:22.321
your statistics, Garick,

30:22.362 --> 30:24.823
are charges that this date

30:22.362 --> 30:24.823
or acquaintance rape

30:24.864 --> 30:27.534
is being hidden

30:24.864 --> 30:27.534
by universities and colleges

30:27.576 --> 30:30.287
in order to

30:27.576 --> 30:30.287
protect their image

30:27.576 --> 30:30.287
among prospective students

30:30.329 --> 30:31.163
and their families.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.800
ANNIE:

30:38.920 --> 30:42.800
We had been trying to change

30:38.920 --> 30:42.800
the university for years,

30:42.841 --> 30:44.551
and nothing was

30:42.841 --> 30:44.551
getting any better.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.221
And so, we started

30:45.969 --> 30:48.221
looking to do something

30:48.263 --> 30:52.058
to force them or shame them

30:48.263 --> 30:52.058
into doing the right thing.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.228
ANDREA:   We started digging

30:52.100 --> 30:55.228
and doing months

30:52.100 --> 30:55.228
and months of research.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.023
ANNIE:   On sexual harassment

30:55.270 --> 30:58.023
law, on rape statutes.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.109
ANDREA:   And then I read

30:58.064 --> 31:01.109
about  Title IX.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.446
ANNIE: Title IX   is

31:01.151 --> 31:04.446
a gender equity law.

31:04.488 --> 31:08.033
And it guarantees

31:04.488 --> 31:08.033
anyone the right

31:04.488 --> 31:08.033
to an equal education.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.787
When perpetrators

31:09.368 --> 31:11.787
are allowed to remain

31:11.829 --> 31:13.997
on campus and

31:11.829 --> 31:13.997
schools don't expel them,

31:14.039 --> 31:16.124
even when they're

31:14.039 --> 31:16.124
found responsible,

31:16.166 --> 31:18.084
then they're in

31:16.166 --> 31:18.084
violation of  Title IX

31:18.126 --> 31:21.380
for contributing to

31:18.126 --> 31:21.380
a hostile environment.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.216
If a school is found in

31:21.421 --> 31:24.216
violation of  Title IX,

31:24.257 --> 31:27.177
the government has the power

31:24.257 --> 31:27.177
to revoke all federal funds,

31:27.219 --> 31:30.138
which would hopefully

31:27.219 --> 31:30.138
force a school to

31:27.219 --> 31:30.138
be in compliance.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.599
Title IX  and

31:30.180 --> 31:32.599
the pending Campus Save Act

31:32.641 --> 31:34.476
and now this law? Like, what?

31:34.518 --> 31:38.188
ANNIE:   And so, we decided to

31:34.518 --> 31:38.188
file a  Title IX   Complaint.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.982
You basically write

31:38.230 --> 31:40.982
to the Department of Education

31:41.024 --> 31:44.194
and you not only explain

31:41.024 --> 31:44.194
what happened to you,

31:44.236 --> 31:48.281
but you also explain

31:44.236 --> 31:48.281
how it's

31:44.236 --> 31:48.281
a violation of   Title IX.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.201
So, it is Thursday night,

31:48.323 --> 31:51.201
and instead of going out,

31:51.243 --> 31:54.413
we are in, learning case law

31:51.243 --> 31:54.413
until we know   Title IX

31:54.454 --> 31:57.499
and the case law

31:54.454 --> 31:57.499
like the back of our hands.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.752
I had earbuds in.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.752
If I was walking,

31:59.793 --> 32:01.336
if I was, you know,

31:59.793 --> 32:01.336
going on a run or whatever,

32:01.378 --> 32:03.547
instead of music

32:01.378 --> 32:03.547
there were

32:01.378 --> 32:03.547
supreme court cases.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.591
ANDREA:

32:03.589 --> 32:05.591
I read all the case law

32:05.632 --> 32:07.967
on all existing

32:05.632 --> 32:07.967
Title IX   cases.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.720
ANNIE:   Like,

32:08.009 --> 32:09.720
we're sleeping in shifts.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.346
I would write for three hours

32:11.388 --> 32:15.100
and then sleep

32:11.388 --> 32:15.100
for three hours,

32:11.388 --> 32:15.100
and she would do the same.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.686
ANDREA:   And I learned that you

32:15.141 --> 32:17.686
don't have to be

32:15.141 --> 32:17.686
a lawyer to file it,

32:17.728 --> 32:21.857
that you could

32:17.728 --> 32:21.857
be 20 and take on

32:17.728 --> 32:21.857
a 200-year-old university.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.276
ANNIE:

32:23.024 --> 32:24.276
We didn't know how to file.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.863
So, we faxed it, we emailed

32:24.317 --> 32:27.863
it, and we mailed it.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.073
We didn't know what to expect,

32:30.115 --> 32:33.702
and so, I go into

32:30.115 --> 32:33.702
my university

32:30.115 --> 32:33.702
mail office one day,

32:33.744 --> 32:37.080
and I have this big

32:33.744 --> 32:37.080
envelope from

32:33.744 --> 32:37.080
the Department of Education,

32:37.122 --> 32:40.292
and I'm just,

32:37.122 --> 32:40.292
like, freaking out.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.545
I'm, like,

32:40.333 --> 32:43.545
crying, I'm calling Drea,

32:40.333 --> 32:43.545
Melinda, I'm just like,

32:43.587 --> 32:45.964
"They took our case.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.964
They took our case."

32:48.467 --> 32:50.135
REPORTER 3:   Flat out denial.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.512
Leaders at UNC say accusations

32:50.176 --> 32:52.512
that the university

32:52.554 --> 32:55.515
underreported sexual

32:52.554 --> 32:55.515
assault cases is false.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.226
REPORTER 4:   UNC Chapel Hill

General Council,

32:55.557 --> 32:58.226
Leslie Strohm,

32:58.268 --> 33:01.730
pointed out what a false

32:58.268 --> 33:01.730
claim can do to

32:58.268 --> 33:01.730
a university's reputation.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.108
The allegations are false.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.108
They are untrue.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.402
And they are just plain wrong.

33:10.322 --> 33:15.160
ANNIE:   "False. Untrue.

33:10.322 --> 33:15.160
And just plain wrong."

33:15.201 --> 33:18.789
That resonates in my head.

33:15.201 --> 33:18.789
I hear that when I sleep.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.248
To say,

33:18.831 --> 33:20.248
"None of this happened.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.542
"We're not underreporting.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.542
We didn't mess up."

33:22.584 --> 33:23.752
It's just betrayal.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.090
DANIELLE:   Schools are

33:27.130 --> 33:29.090
actively and aggressively

33:29.132 --> 33:30.717
not wanting to

33:29.132 --> 33:30.717
tell the truth about

33:30.759 --> 33:32.218
what's going on

33:30.759 --> 33:32.218
in their campuses

33:32.260 --> 33:35.096
because the first campuses

33:32.260 --> 33:35.096
to do so will be,

33:35.138 --> 33:36.807
you know, kind of known as

33:35.138 --> 33:36.807
the rape campuses,

33:36.849 --> 33:38.517
where they actually

33:36.849 --> 33:38.517
have a rape problem.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.770
But, you know, rape

33:38.558 --> 33:41.770
is happening on all

33:38.558 --> 33:41.770
college campuses,

33:41.812 --> 33:44.564
and there are

33:41.812 --> 33:44.564
perverse economic

33:41.812 --> 33:44.564
and reputational incentives

33:44.606 --> 33:46.107
to hide those numbers.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.903
I analogize it to

33:46.149 --> 33:49.903
getting a letter.

33:49.945 --> 33:54.073
So, you're a parent

33:49.945 --> 33:54.073
and you get a letter

33:49.945 --> 33:54.073
in the middle of the summer,

33:54.115 --> 33:56.994
and it says, "Dear Mr.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.994
and Mrs. Schultz,

33:57.035 --> 33:59.788
"we're so happy that Johnny

33:57.035 --> 33:59.788
is going to be a freshman,

33:59.830 --> 34:02.624
"and we thought we might

33:59.830 --> 34:02.624
need to let you know

34:02.666 --> 34:06.378
"that there's

34:02.666 --> 34:06.378
a one-in-four or five chance

34:02.666 --> 34:06.378
that while Johnny's here,

34:06.419 --> 34:09.464
"he's going to be the victim

34:06.419 --> 34:09.464
of a drive-by shooting."

34:09.505 --> 34:11.466
What's so vexing

34:09.505 --> 34:11.466
about this problem

34:11.507 --> 34:14.969
is that the shooters

34:11.507 --> 34:14.969
are other students.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.513
"Thank you so much

34:15.012 --> 34:16.513
for your tuition money.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.431
"We so look

34:16.554 --> 34:19.431
forward to welcoming

34:16.554 --> 34:19.431
Johnny in the fall."

34:20.766 --> 34:24.437
Would any parent send

34:20.766 --> 34:24.437
his or her child there?

34:24.478 --> 34:26.648
They protect perpetrators,

34:24.478 --> 34:26.648
I think, across the board

34:26.690 --> 34:29.317
because they have

34:26.690 --> 34:29.317
a financial

34:26.690 --> 34:29.317
incentive to do so.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.235
Perpetrators who are found

34:29.359 --> 34:31.235
responsible for rape

34:31.277 --> 34:33.947
are much more likely

34:31.277 --> 34:33.947
to sue institutions

34:33.989 --> 34:38.076
than survivors are,

34:33.989 --> 34:38.076
and institutions

34:33.989 --> 34:38.076
like to avoid lawsuits.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.746
And so, in an effort

34:38.117 --> 34:40.746
to avoid lawsuits,

34:40.786 --> 34:42.664
they pretty much

34:40.786 --> 34:42.664
do whatever they can

34:42.706 --> 34:44.248
to give them

34:42.706 --> 34:44.248
a slap on the wrist.

(NARRATOR READING)

35:12.360 --> 35:13.152
(GASPING)

35:28.334 --> 35:30.087
Any allegation of

sexual assault is something

35:30.128 --> 35:32.130
that we at the university

35:30.128 --> 35:32.130
take very seriously.

PAT COTTRELL:   My career in law

36:51.877 --> 36:55.463
enforcement started in 1969

36:55.505 --> 36:58.424
from the South

36:55.505 --> 36:58.424
Bend Police Department

36:55.505 --> 36:58.424
and then went to

36:58.466 --> 37:00.802
the University of

36:58.466 --> 37:00.802
Notre Dame Police Department.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.846
University students are...

37:02.888 --> 37:05.640
They're just wonderful kids.

37:05.682 --> 37:10.311
But there's...

37:05.682 --> 37:10.311
Just like anywhere,

37:05.682 --> 37:10.311
there's a percentage

37:10.353 --> 37:17.318
of, um, absolutely horrible

37:10.353 --> 37:17.318
people too, you know.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.238
And, of course,

37:17.360 --> 37:20.238
I had to deal with that, too.

RACHEL HUDAK:

37:24.576 --> 37:28.080
Saint Mary's is the

37:24.576 --> 37:28.080
sister school to Notre Dame.

37:28.121 --> 37:31.875
It's one of the best

37:28.121 --> 37:31.875
catholic all-women's

37:28.121 --> 37:31.875
colleges in the nation,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.210
and I was proud to go there.

37:35.712 --> 37:39.632
I was really

37:35.712 --> 37:39.632
happy I was part of

37:35.712 --> 37:39.632
campus ministries.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.720
I decided to be

37:41.009 --> 37:43.720
a biology major.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.849
I had a dream of

37:43.762 --> 37:47.849
going to medical school.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.351
Compared to my sister,

37:47.891 --> 37:50.351
I'm more of a book person,

37:50.393 --> 37:52.938
and she kind of

37:50.393 --> 37:52.938
always made fun of me

37:52.979 --> 37:55.232
'cause I liked to

37:52.979 --> 37:55.232
stay in on the weekends,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.276
and she'd kind of say

37:55.273 --> 37:58.276
I was a party pooper

37:58.317 --> 38:00.153
and want me to

37:58.317 --> 38:00.153
come out and stuff.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.280
And I did go out.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.280
And it was fun.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.118
It was Halloween.

38:08.494 --> 38:11.330
A call came in on my phone.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.709
It was from someone I knew

38:11.372 --> 38:14.709
who went to Notre Dame.

38:14.751 --> 38:19.297
He's like, "You have to come

38:14.751 --> 38:19.297
to a Halloween party."

38:19.338 --> 38:22.717
You know, I trust people.

38:19.338 --> 38:22.717
I trusted what he said.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.222
So, you know,

38:24.636 --> 38:27.222
I just went along with it.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.559
We got to his dorm.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.771
You know, I asked him, "Well,

38:31.601 --> 38:34.771
where is everyone else?"

38:34.813 --> 38:38.108
And he's like,

38:34.813 --> 38:38.108
"Oh, they're coming."

38:38.150 --> 38:43.321
And eventually

38:38.150 --> 38:43.321
his friends left,

38:38.150 --> 38:43.321
and it was just me and him.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.454
(CRYING) And

38:50.036 --> 38:51.454
that's when it happened.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.127
She, of course, said, "No."

38:57.169 --> 39:00.421
You know, trying to keep him

38:57.169 --> 39:00.421
from doing what he was doing.

39:00.463 --> 39:04.676
And then he eventually

39:00.463 --> 39:04.676
just forced her

39:00.463 --> 39:04.676
and raped her.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.724
Lieutenant

39:09.014 --> 39:11.724
Cottrell interviewed

39:09.014 --> 39:11.724
all the people that,

39:11.766 --> 39:14.186
you know, I had

39:11.766 --> 39:14.186
known that were involved.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.980
In my opinion,

39:14.227 --> 39:16.980
I had a conspiracy

39:17.022 --> 39:22.777
of not only

39:17.022 --> 39:22.777
the suspect that was involved

39:17.022 --> 39:22.777
in raping the victim,

39:22.819 --> 39:28.491
but I also had friends of his

39:22.819 --> 39:28.491
that helped convince her

39:28.533 --> 39:30.368
that there was a party

39:28.533 --> 39:30.368
that she was going to.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.582
PAT:   The University had

39:33.579 --> 39:36.582
their judicial hearing.

39:38.459 --> 39:43.089
I had this idealistic view

39:38.459 --> 39:43.089
that if I was

39:38.459 --> 39:43.089
telling the truth

39:43.131 --> 39:44.632
that they would support me.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.009
And, um...

39:47.093 --> 39:48.386
They didn't.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.386
(CHUCKLES)

39:50.096 --> 39:54.559

39:50.096 --> 39:54.559
have the crime stats

39:54.600 --> 39:59.689
as low as possible

39:54.600 --> 39:59.689
so that, you know,

39:59.731 --> 40:05.278
it doesn't

39:59.731 --> 40:05.278
detract from applicants

39:59.731 --> 40:05.278
to the University.

40:14.037 --> 40:17.415
President of

40:14.037 --> 40:17.415
Saint Mary's college.

40:19.251 --> 40:23.755
Saint Mary's must

40:19.251 --> 40:23.755
always be committed

40:19.251 --> 40:23.755
to providing our students

40:23.796 --> 40:28.009
with an excellent intellectual

40:23.796 --> 40:28.009
and academic experience.

40:28.051 --> 40:31.429
She kind of blew it off

40:28.051 --> 40:31.429
and didn't take it seriously,

40:28.051 --> 40:31.429
you know.

40:33.181 --> 40:36.309
RACHEL:   She said,

40:33.181 --> 40:36.309
"Well, these things

40:33.181 --> 40:36.309
don't happen here."

40:40.313 --> 40:45.360
PAT:

40:40.313 --> 40:45.360
It got worse and worse for me

40:40.313 --> 40:45.360
as the years went along.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.779
Um...

40:47.820 --> 40:52.284
Not only dealing with what

40:47.820 --> 40:52.284
happened to the victim,

40:52.325 --> 40:57.289
but also dealing with

40:52.325 --> 40:57.289
what the university did.

40:57.330 --> 41:01.459
My bosses were

40:57.330 --> 41:01.459
saying that they

41:01.500 --> 41:06.172
had empathy for

41:01.500 --> 41:06.172
victims of crimes,

41:06.214 --> 41:10.718
but it was like I told them,

41:10.760 --> 41:13.388
that "Talk is cheap.

41:13.430 --> 41:16.849
"And that's all it is

41:13.430 --> 41:16.849
with you guys is talk.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.644
"You don't really

41:16.891 --> 41:19.644
support victims of crimes.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.814
"I do.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.399
"And I can't work

41:22.855 --> 41:24.399
for you any longer."

41:29.612 --> 41:30.989
RACHEL:   I didn't

41:29.612 --> 41:30.989
really talk about it.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.365
I kind of just...

41:32.407 --> 41:33.950
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

41:33.992 --> 41:38.371
...stayed in my room

41:33.992 --> 41:38.371
for a couple months

41:33.992 --> 41:38.371
until Christmas.

41:39.789 --> 41:42.208
And I didn't sleep.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.543
My nights and

41:42.250 --> 41:44.543
days were mixed up.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.005
I had to, um...

41:48.214 --> 41:50.508
Couldn't go to class,

41:48.214 --> 41:50.508
and so I cut down.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.846
I just completely

41:52.177 --> 41:54.846
changed as a person.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.394
CAROLINE:   I think

41:59.184 --> 42:01.394
the biggest reason

41:59.184 --> 42:01.394
why it's so hard

42:01.436 --> 42:02.687
to be on a college campus

42:02.728 --> 42:05.731
after you've been raped

42:02.728 --> 42:05.731
or sexually assaulted

42:05.773 --> 42:07.859
is that it's

42:05.773 --> 42:07.859
a small place, right,

42:07.900 --> 42:09.402
where everything

42:07.900 --> 42:09.402
is structured.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.611
Your living

42:09.444 --> 42:10.611
space is structured,

42:10.653 --> 42:12.530
your eating

42:10.653 --> 42:12.530
space is structured,

42:12.571 --> 42:13.990
so, you're gonna

42:12.571 --> 42:13.990
run into your rapist.

42:14.032 --> 42:18.619
I couldn't go out.

42:14.032 --> 42:18.619
Like, I couldn't

42:14.032 --> 42:18.619
mingle with strangers.

42:18.661 --> 42:21.164
I felt the campus getting

42:18.661 --> 42:21.164
smaller and smaller to me.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.124
There were less

42:21.206 --> 42:23.124
and less places

42:21.206 --> 42:23.124
I felt comfortable going.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.169
I walk around with

42:23.166 --> 42:26.169
my pepper spray on my keys,

42:26.211 --> 42:28.754
and I'm always just on edge.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.219
DAVID:   There's a whole

42:31.549 --> 42:34.219
physiological side to PTSD.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.595
When you experience

42:34.260 --> 42:36.595
a traumatic event like this,

42:37.430 --> 42:39.765
your nervous system,

42:40.641 --> 42:42.935
tends to get very reactive.

42:42.977 --> 42:45.188
I started having

42:42.977 --> 42:45.188
more panic attacks.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.066
When I was in my

42:45.230 --> 42:48.066
depressed state,

42:45.230 --> 42:48.066
I just slept all day long.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.650
I couldn't stop crying.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.777
I couldn't stop

42:49.692 --> 42:51.777
thinking about it.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.777
I self-harmed.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.491
During the vacation between

42:56.533 --> 42:59.494
I guess, semester

42:56.533 --> 42:59.494
one and semester two,

42:56.533 --> 42:59.494
I tried to kill myself.

43:01.371 --> 43:05.583
I had a lot of,

43:01.371 --> 43:05.583
I mean, of course depression,

43:01.371 --> 43:05.583
suicidal thoughts.

43:07.043 --> 43:09.462
REPORTER 6:   Trey Malone took

43:07.043 --> 43:09.462
his own life last June.

43:09.504 --> 43:12.631
In his suicide note,

43:09.504 --> 43:12.631
Malone wrote

43:09.504 --> 43:12.631
about being sexually abused

43:12.673 --> 43:15.301
while a student

43:12.673 --> 43:15.301
at Amherst College,

43:15.343 --> 43:17.929
and the school's

43:15.343 --> 43:17.929
lack of response.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.265
Men are sexually assaulted.

43:20.306 --> 43:23.642
And typically that is

43:20.306 --> 43:23.642
perpetrated by other men.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.230
And I think for

43:23.684 --> 43:27.230
a lot of male survivors

43:23.684 --> 43:27.230
who are sexually assaulted,

43:27.272 --> 43:30.775
it challenges many beliefs

43:27.272 --> 43:30.775
that they have

43:27.272 --> 43:30.775
about themselves.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.735
Men aren't supposed

43:30.816 --> 43:32.735
to become vulnerable.

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
They always say,

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
"You allowed yourself

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
to do it. Why did you do it?

43:35.530 --> 43:37.198
"Why didn't you

43:35.530 --> 43:37.198
fight them off?"

43:37.240 --> 43:39.117
Men have to be strong,

43:37.240 --> 43:39.117
and men wouldn't let

43:37.240 --> 43:39.117
this happen to them.

43:40.701 --> 43:43.538
Because of

43:40.701 --> 43:43.538
the emphasis there is

43:43.580 --> 43:47.542
on it being

43:43.580 --> 43:47.542
a crime against females,

43:47.584 --> 43:50.711
men feel less comfortable

43:47.584 --> 43:50.711
coming forward with it.

43:50.753 --> 43:55.007
Reporting rates amongst men

43:50.753 --> 43:55.007
are just so infinitesimal

43:55.049 --> 43:57.885
that it actually

43:55.049 --> 43:57.885
makes it very hard

43:55.049 --> 43:57.885
to do research on this,

43:57.927 --> 44:03.641
let alone to get

43:57.927 --> 44:03.641
a real understanding

43:57.927 --> 44:03.641
of the scope of the problem.

44:19.198 --> 44:24.745
ANDREA:

44:19.198 --> 44:24.745
You are built from the ground

44:19.198 --> 44:24.745
as a Tar Heel,

44:24.787 --> 44:28.207
as a member of a community

44:24.787 --> 44:28.207
that is so much

44:24.787 --> 44:28.207
bigger than you.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.461
I was directly

44:29.750 --> 44:31.461
going against it.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.590
Tonight the US

44:33.671 --> 44:35.590
Department of Education

44:35.632 --> 44:37.300
has launched its

44:35.632 --> 44:37.300
own investigation

44:37.342 --> 44:39.636
into how UNC

44:37.342 --> 44:39.636
Chapel Hill has been

44:39.677 --> 44:44.015
handling sexual

44:39.677 --> 44:44.015
assault cases on campus.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.726
ANNIE:   It wasn't until

44:44.056 --> 44:47.726
we filed the complaint

44:44.056 --> 44:47.726
that the retaliation started.

44:47.768 --> 44:48.853
And it's been bad.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.109
I've gotten death threats,

44:52.440 --> 44:55.109
I've gotten rape threats.

44:55.151 --> 44:57.278
Of course, Internet trolls

44:55.151 --> 44:57.278
are always there.

44:57.320 --> 45:02.033
But I had one

44:57.320 --> 45:02.033
in-person threat,

44:57.320 --> 45:02.033
which was kind of scary. Um...

45:02.074 --> 45:04.494
"Bang-bang, bitch. Die."

45:04.536 --> 45:06.663
ANDREA:   My residence

45:04.536 --> 45:06.663
hall was broken into,

45:06.703 --> 45:08.705
and it was

45:06.703 --> 45:08.705
completely vandalized.

45:08.747 --> 45:11.917
Spray paint everywhere,

45:08.747 --> 45:11.917
a knife was left behind.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.710
And messages were

45:11.959 --> 45:13.710
painted all over.

45:18.007 --> 45:21.302
I felt like I was in

45:18.007 --> 45:21.302
danger all the time,

45:21.344 --> 45:25.264
and that's what I thought of

45:21.344 --> 45:25.264
when I went to classes.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.559
I went, you know, from being

45:25.306 --> 45:27.559
valedictorian in high school

45:27.600 --> 45:30.687
and then, you know,

45:27.600 --> 45:30.687
struggling to

45:27.600 --> 45:30.687
finish my classes.

45:30.727 --> 45:33.398
And not knowing how

45:30.727 --> 45:33.398
to tell my parents,

45:30.727 --> 45:33.398
which I never did.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.612
INTERVIEWER:

45:37.734 --> 45:39.612
Can you talk a little bit

45:37.734 --> 45:39.612
about what it was like

45:39.654 --> 45:41.738
when your parents found out?

45:41.780 --> 45:42.823
They still don't know.

45:42.865 --> 45:43.908
INTERVIEWER:

45:42.865 --> 45:43.908
They still don't know.

45:43.949 --> 45:45.159
Yeah.

45:45.201 --> 45:46.785
Um... (CHUCKLES)

45:48.162 --> 45:51.916
I thought about telling them

45:48.162 --> 45:51.916
many, many times.

45:53.710 --> 45:56.753
And I didn't tell my parents

45:53.710 --> 45:56.753
until a couple days later,

45:56.795 --> 45:58.423
which was probably,

45:56.795 --> 45:58.423
like, the hardest

45:58.464 --> 46:01.342
thing I've ever

45:58.464 --> 46:01.342
had to do, ever.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.096
Now I'm gonna start crying.

46:05.137 --> 46:06.514
INTERVIEWER:

46:05.137 --> 46:06.514
It's okay, you can cry.

46:06.556 --> 46:08.516
You don't have to hold it in.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.142
Like,

46:08.558 --> 46:10.142
I remember skyping my dad...

46:13.605 --> 46:16.232
INTERVIEWER: What worries

46:13.605 --> 46:16.232
you about telling them?

46:16.274 --> 46:19.110
The conversation afterwards.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.530
I worry that they'd

46:20.319 --> 46:22.530
look at me differently.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.619
I'm worried that they'd

46:25.199 --> 46:27.619
want to talk about it again.

46:31.788 --> 46:34.041
And just the fact

46:31.788 --> 46:34.041
that they would know.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.421
That it would just be

46:37.044 --> 46:38.421
there in their minds

46:38.463 --> 46:41.090
when they looked at me.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.050
Just to hear my

46:41.132 --> 46:43.050
mom's voice on the phone,

46:43.092 --> 46:45.136
her feeling so

46:43.092 --> 46:45.136
helpless in that moment,

46:45.177 --> 46:48.514
is probably one of

46:45.177 --> 46:48.514
the worst aspects

46:45.177 --> 46:48.514
of this entire ordeal,

46:48.556 --> 46:51.016
which probably makes me

46:48.556 --> 46:51.016
the most angry

46:48.556 --> 46:51.016
at my assailant.

46:51.058 --> 46:54.771
(CHUCKLES) My mom

46:51.058 --> 46:54.771
was on the plane

46:51.058 --> 46:54.771
the next day after I told her.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.317
(SOBS)

47:01.569 --> 47:06.491
My dad, he wears

47:01.569 --> 47:06.491
his Notre Dame ring every day.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.993
I've never seen

47:06.532 --> 47:08.993
him take it off,

47:06.532 --> 47:08.993
and he didn't...

47:09.034 --> 47:11.287
He wasn't wearing it anymore.

47:11.329 --> 47:15.541
His finger that

47:11.329 --> 47:15.541
has a permanent mark

47:11.329 --> 47:15.541
from his ring

47:15.583 --> 47:17.251
and didn't have his ring on.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.170
And it just...

47:19.211 --> 47:23.341
It was even more heartbreaking

47:19.211 --> 47:23.341
for me to watch my dad.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.843
I call her from

47:23.382 --> 47:26.843
a thousand miles away

47:23.382 --> 47:26.843
and tell her this.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.390
And I just wanted

47:28.929 --> 47:31.390
her to be there.

47:40.483 --> 47:45.196
TOM SEEBERG:

47:40.483 --> 47:45.196
Lizzy always had this

47:40.483 --> 47:45.196
big, beautiful, radiant smile.

47:45.237 --> 47:49.033
It was electric, and it made

47:45.237 --> 47:49.033
other people happy.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.163
We had 11 family

47:51.160 --> 47:54.163
members attend Notre Dame

47:54.205 --> 47:57.709
and two family members,

47:54.205 --> 47:57.709
including Lizzy,

47:54.205 --> 47:57.709
that went to Saint Mary's.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.795
And she, I think,

47:57.750 --> 48:00.795
really felt affirmed

48:00.837 --> 48:04.131
that this was

48:00.837 --> 48:04.131
the right choice.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.259
She was really,

48:04.173 --> 48:07.259
really happy to be there.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.469
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

48:08.511 --> 48:10.095
â™ª And a little bit

48:08.511 --> 48:10.095
of chicken fried â™ª

48:11.764 --> 48:15.393
She went over on

48:11.764 --> 48:15.393
August 31st with a friend

48:15.434 --> 48:17.894
to attend an activities fair

48:15.434 --> 48:17.894
at Notre Dame,

48:18.771 --> 48:21.148
and that

48:18.771 --> 48:21.148
evening they went back

48:21.190 --> 48:25.444
to this

48:21.190 --> 48:25.444
football player's room.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.450
It was four of them in there.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.910
The football

48:31.492 --> 48:33.910
player and his friend

48:31.492 --> 48:33.910
and Lizzy and her friend.

48:33.952 --> 48:36.205
And then...

48:36.247 --> 48:38.374
I guess, rather suddenly,

48:38.416 --> 48:42.169
the... The, uh...

48:38.416 --> 48:42.169
The other two left the room

48:42.211 --> 48:44.714
and left Lizzy alone

48:42.211 --> 48:44.714
with this football player.

48:44.756 --> 48:48.092
And then he

48:44.756 --> 48:48.092
basically jumps her.

48:48.133 --> 48:51.345
He pulls her on top of him

48:51.387 --> 48:56.267
and removes her shirt,

48:51.387 --> 48:56.267
and bra,

48:56.308 --> 48:59.437
and then also begins

48:56.308 --> 48:59.437
to try to take off her pants.

49:02.022 --> 49:05.317
And the next

49:02.022 --> 49:05.317
day Lizzy reports.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.152
It never crossed our mind

49:05.359 --> 49:07.152
that they wouldn't do right.

49:09.946 --> 49:11.824
The accused,

49:09.946 --> 49:11.824
they couldn't find him.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.576
They had

49:11.866 --> 49:13.576
difficulty locating him.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.995
Everyone knows where

49:14.827 --> 49:16.995
this individual is.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.791
Certainly

49:17.037 --> 49:19.791
the athletic department knows.

49:19.832 --> 49:23.210
He played two

49:19.832 --> 49:23.210
home football games

49:19.832 --> 49:23.210
before he was interviewed.

49:24.587 --> 49:27.381
Notre Dame Stadium

49:24.587 --> 49:27.381
holds 80,000 people,

49:27.423 --> 49:31.803
so, that's times two,

49:27.423 --> 49:31.803
160,000 people

49:27.423 --> 49:31.803
knew where this guy was

49:31.844 --> 49:36.098
before the Notre

49:31.844 --> 49:36.098
Dame Security Police

49:31.844 --> 49:36.098
could find him.

49:36.140 --> 49:40.478
There was a directive

49:36.140 --> 49:40.478
that the campus police

49:41.729 --> 49:44.690
cannot contact an athlete

49:44.732 --> 49:47.109
at any athletic facility,

49:49.027 --> 49:53.157
and we cannot contact

49:49.027 --> 49:53.157
any athletic employee

49:53.198 --> 49:59.455
to assist us in

49:53.198 --> 49:59.455
contacting the athlete

49:53.198 --> 49:59.455
that we would be looking for.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.081
INTERVIEWER: So, what was

49:59.497 --> 50:01.081
the point of that?

50:03.835 --> 50:07.755
I guess just to...

50:03.835 --> 50:07.755
(INHALES DEEPLY)

50:07.797 --> 50:10.549
...keep us away

50:07.797 --> 50:10.549
from student athletes.

50:12.301 --> 50:14.595
So, Lizzy ends this exchange

50:12.301 --> 50:14.595
of intimidating texts

50:14.637 --> 50:16.931
from the football

50:14.637 --> 50:16.931
player's friend,

50:16.973 --> 50:19.057
and he comes at

50:16.973 --> 50:19.057
her with a text,

50:20.476 --> 50:24.563
(TOM READING)

50:26.440 --> 50:27.859
And then Lizzy

50:26.440 --> 50:27.859
takes that message

50:27.900 --> 50:32.070
and immediately forwards it

50:27.900 --> 50:32.070
to the detective in charge.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.114
And later

50:32.112 --> 50:34.114
the county prosecutor said

50:34.156 --> 50:35.992
that they would not

50:34.156 --> 50:35.992
be filing any charges

50:36.032 --> 50:40.371
on that particular complaint

50:36.032 --> 50:40.371
and saying that

50:36.032 --> 50:40.371
it wasn't a threat

50:40.412 --> 50:43.791
because

50:40.412 --> 50:43.791
the individual who sent it

50:43.833 --> 50:48.212
believed he was

50:43.833 --> 50:48.212
trying to prevent someone

50:43.833 --> 50:48.212
from filing a false report.

50:53.049 --> 50:55.761
She was becoming very anxious

50:53.049 --> 50:55.761
about this whole situation.

50:57.889 --> 51:00.808
One of her friends

50:57.889 --> 51:00.808
is quoted as saying

50:57.889 --> 51:00.808
that she said, you know,

51:00.850 --> 51:03.059
"He's gonna get away with it."

51:03.101 --> 51:05.270
He denied everything,

51:05.312 --> 51:07.982
and made comments like,

51:05.312 --> 51:07.982
"She was the aggressor."

51:09.901 --> 51:13.487
Friday evening,

51:09.901 --> 51:13.487
I finally looked at my phone,

51:13.529 --> 51:17.157
and I saw a text from

51:13.529 --> 51:17.157
my wife's best friend saying,

51:18.450 --> 51:20.745
"You need to call right away."

51:20.786 --> 51:25.791
And I remember

51:20.786 --> 51:25.791
the words in it was,

51:25.833 --> 51:27.960
"It's bad. It's bad.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.213
"Lizzy took her life today.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.802
"She's gone."

51:49.774 --> 51:51.943
You know, it's brutal.

51:51.984 --> 51:55.571
It's just

51:51.984 --> 51:55.571
really profoundly sad

51:51.984 --> 51:55.571
in those moments

51:55.613 --> 51:59.033
when you just think,

51:55.613 --> 51:59.033
she's not here with us.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.751
ANNIE:   Is it just students?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.751
Is it everybody?

52:11.420 --> 52:15.758
ANDREA:   Um, students

52:11.420 --> 52:15.758
and university,

52:11.420 --> 52:15.758
community members.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.510
So, I'm in Oregon.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.680
Drea ends up moving to Oregon

52:18.552 --> 52:21.680
and taking the semester off.

52:25.643 --> 52:29.897
"Every place I've separated

52:25.643 --> 52:29.897
with a semicolon

52:25.643 --> 52:29.897
is a different..."

52:29.939 --> 52:31.398
She and I started talking.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.942
We're like, okay,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.942
"We're gonna keep doing this.

52:32.984 --> 52:35.360
"Don't know how

52:32.984 --> 52:35.360
we're gonna fund it,

52:32.984 --> 52:35.360
but we're gonna do something."

52:36.278 --> 52:37.613
We called everybody.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.407
Most people

52:37.655 --> 52:40.407
totally laughed it off.

52:40.449 --> 52:44.202
Just looking at rape reporting

52:40.449 --> 52:44.202
in general, it's really low...

52:44.244 --> 52:46.038
But one of

52:44.244 --> 52:46.038
the people who we had

52:46.080 --> 52:47.665
reached out to

52:46.080 --> 52:47.665
about the UNC case

52:47.706 --> 52:48.833
was at the  New York Times.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.043
And he's like,

52:48.874 --> 52:51.043
"Oh, that's interesting."

52:51.085 --> 52:52.753
It ended up

52:51.085 --> 52:52.753
becoming a front page

52:51.085 --> 52:52.753
New York Times   story.

52:55.756 --> 53:00.803
That's when we got a flood of

52:55.756 --> 53:00.803
emails, Facebook, tweets.

53:00.845 --> 53:04.431
Like, somebody tweeted at me,

53:00.845 --> 53:04.431
"Me, too.

53:00.845 --> 53:04.431
It happened to me, too."

53:04.473 --> 53:07.183
This is Annie.

53:04.473 --> 53:07.183
And Andrea's here with me.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.185
Do you see

53:07.225 --> 53:09.185
a button in the middle

53:09.227 --> 53:10.896
of your screen?

53:09.227 --> 53:10.896
It says "start video."

53:12.023 --> 53:13.732
Yay!

53:12.023 --> 53:13.732
Cool. Look at that.

53:13.774 --> 53:17.028
It was my freshman year.

53:13.774 --> 53:17.028
I'd been at school

53:13.774 --> 53:17.028
for a couple of weeks.

53:17.069 --> 53:18.988
I'd made friends

53:17.069 --> 53:18.988
in some frat houses.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.990
ANNIE:

53:19.030 --> 53:20.990
People reached out through

53:19.030 --> 53:20.990
all these different mediums.

53:21.032 --> 53:23.408
A lot of Facebook.

53:21.032 --> 53:23.408
A lot of emails.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.661
"I froze and

53:23.450 --> 53:25.661
couldn't fight back."

53:25.703 --> 53:27.245
"I don't know if

53:25.703 --> 53:27.245
it's appropriate to have

53:27.287 --> 53:28.956
"told this story to

53:27.287 --> 53:28.956
you without asking,

53:28.998 --> 53:31.792
"and I'm sorry if it's been

53:28.998 --> 53:31.792
harmful to you in any way,

53:31.834 --> 53:34.336
"but it needs to stop."

53:36.088 --> 53:37.548
Wow.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.509
I remember I was

53:37.589 --> 53:40.509
in one meeting

53:37.589 --> 53:40.509
after some story broke,

53:40.551 --> 53:44.304
and I had 50 calls in an hour.

53:40.551 --> 53:44.304
I had 50 calls.

53:44.346 --> 53:47.099
WOMAN 5:   I've never heard of

53:44.346 --> 53:47.099
a case that has gone

53:47.141 --> 53:49.685
in, like,

53:47.141 --> 53:49.685
the survivor's favor.

53:49.727 --> 53:50.895
I mean, he admitted it.

53:50.936 --> 53:51.937
He admitted to sexual assault

53:51.979 --> 53:53.022
and got

53:51.979 --> 53:53.022
an eight-week suspension.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.481
Mmm-hmm.

53:54.523 --> 53:57.484
The Dean of Students

53:54.523 --> 53:57.484
accused me of being drunk

53:57.526 --> 53:59.945
and told me that I had,

53:57.526 --> 53:59.945
like, a serious problem.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.573
ANNIE:

53:59.987 --> 54:02.573
So, many of the survivors

53:59.987 --> 54:02.573
coming forward were saying,

54:02.614 --> 54:05.993
"My rape was bad,

54:02.614 --> 54:05.993
but the way I was

54:02.614 --> 54:05.993
treated was worse."

54:06.035 --> 54:11.665
I was raped in the Honors Dorm

54:06.035 --> 54:11.665
above the Department's Office.

54:11.707 --> 54:15.211
And the Department Office

54:11.707 --> 54:15.211
took my scholarship.

54:11.707 --> 54:15.211
It just doesn't...

54:15.251 --> 54:17.713
ANNIE:

54:15.251 --> 54:17.713
I was up working at 4:00,

54:15.251 --> 54:17.713
and then I'd go to work,

54:17.755 --> 54:20.298
and then I come back

54:17.755 --> 54:20.298
and sometimes

54:17.755 --> 54:20.298
there'd be survivors

54:20.340 --> 54:22.384
in my apartment

54:20.340 --> 54:22.384
that needed to talk.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.762
WOMAN 6: (LAUGHS)   You

54:22.426 --> 54:24.762
probably hear stories

54:22.426 --> 54:24.762
like this all the time.

54:24.803 --> 54:28.515
I know, but it

54:24.803 --> 54:28.515
doesn't make it any better.

54:28.557 --> 54:32.477
Now I'm realizing

54:28.557 --> 54:32.477
how much better I feel

54:28.557 --> 54:32.477
from talking about it.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.479
You're not alone.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.479
You're not alone.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.523
And no matter how

54:34.521 --> 54:36.523
many awful things...

54:36.565 --> 54:37.942
ANNIE:   I basically had

54:36.565 --> 54:37.942
to make a choice if I

54:37.983 --> 54:40.194
wanted to continue

54:37.983 --> 54:40.194
to support survivors

54:40.236 --> 54:44.531
or have my actual

54:40.236 --> 54:44.531
administrative

54:40.236 --> 54:44.531
job at a university.

54:44.573 --> 54:47.952
I figured I could do

54:44.573 --> 54:47.952
more good this way,

54:44.573 --> 54:47.952
so I resigned.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.663
On our to-do list,

54:50.079 --> 54:51.663
we have Vanderbilt.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.665
Yep.

54:53.707 --> 54:54.959
Um...

54:55.000 --> 54:56.668
U-Conn.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.921
Formalizing a national network

54:56.710 --> 54:58.921
is on our to-do list.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.921
(GIGGLES)

54:58.963 --> 55:00.338
That's pending.

55:00.380 --> 55:01.381
I found my paychecks.

55:06.220 --> 55:10.224
ANNIE:   What Drea and

55:06.220 --> 55:10.224
I are looking to see

55:06.220 --> 55:10.224
is how do we show that UNC,

55:10.266 --> 55:11.976
it's not in isolation.

55:13.602 --> 55:15.311
We started seeing,

55:13.602 --> 55:15.311
you know, what was happening

55:15.353 --> 55:17.022
at campuses

55:15.353 --> 55:17.022
across the country.

55:20.985 --> 55:25.156
We look at all

55:20.985 --> 55:25.156
the cases we've heard,

55:20.985 --> 55:25.156
then we make this map,

55:25.197 --> 55:27.449
and every time another school

55:25.197 --> 55:27.449
called or whatever,

55:27.491 --> 55:29.243
we put a dot on the map.

55:29.285 --> 55:30.828
And I remember

55:29.285 --> 55:30.828
talking to Drea, and I'm like,

55:30.869 --> 55:33.164
"Why has no one

55:30.869 --> 55:33.164
connected the dots before?"

55:33.205 --> 55:35.291
We have a case

55:33.205 --> 55:35.291
at Amherst, Yale,

55:35.331 --> 55:37.960
Penn State,

55:35.331 --> 55:37.960
Berkeley, Oxy, UNC,

55:38.002 --> 55:40.378
and nobody said,

55:38.002 --> 55:40.378
"I think we should

55:38.002 --> 55:40.378
connect these dots

55:40.420 --> 55:41.672
"'cause there

55:40.420 --> 55:41.672
might be something

55:41.713 --> 55:44.883
"going on here,

55:41.713 --> 55:44.883
bigger than one problem."

ANDREA:

55:44.925 --> 55:47.970
And you see how many people

55:44.925 --> 55:47.970
are being impacted by them,

55:48.012 --> 55:51.098
and every one of those dots

55:48.012 --> 55:51.098
being more than one story.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.348
You start to see

55:51.140 --> 55:52.348
it as an epidemic.

55:54.310 --> 55:56.603
What if we could

55:54.310 --> 55:56.603
build a network?

55:56.645 --> 55:59.439
What if we could

55:56.645 --> 55:59.439
connect our stories?

55:59.481 --> 56:01.900
We could actually

55:59.481 --> 56:01.900
make campus rape

56:01.942 --> 56:04.195
a problem that

56:01.942 --> 56:04.195
people cared about.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.367
Hi, Sofie!

56:11.743 --> 56:13.329
Hello.

56:14.663 --> 56:16.372
ANNIE: Hi! (GIGGLES)

56:16.414 --> 56:17.415
Do you want to see Drea?

56:19.751 --> 56:21.503
Can you see?

56:21.545 --> 56:23.922
Drea!

56:23.964 --> 56:26.133
ANNIE:   Sofie was one of

56:23.964 --> 56:26.133
the first activists

56:23.964 --> 56:26.133
who reached out,

56:26.175 --> 56:27.718
and she was from Berkeley.

56:27.759 --> 56:30.428
There's been

56:27.759 --> 56:30.428
an increase in the number

56:30.470 --> 56:33.182
of sexual assaults

56:30.470 --> 56:33.182
that have happened.

56:33.224 --> 56:35.809
ANNIE:

56:33.224 --> 56:35.809
She's like, "This is exactly

56:33.224 --> 56:35.809
what's happening at Berkeley.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.978
"I know so many other people

56:35.851 --> 56:37.978
that are dealing with this.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.521
"How can we do what you did?"

56:39.563 --> 56:41.397
And so, we started

56:39.563 --> 56:41.397
working together.

56:43.901 --> 56:44.902
(YELLS) Annie!

56:44.943 --> 56:45.986
Hi! (LAUGHING)

56:50.115 --> 56:52.408
How are you?

56:50.115 --> 56:52.408
Hi!

56:52.450 --> 56:53.577
ANNIE: Hi, how was your trip?

56:53.618 --> 56:55.037
Are you scared of

56:53.618 --> 56:55.037
retaliation at all?

56:55.079 --> 56:57.581
Yeah.

56:57.622 --> 57:01.919
So far, the students who know

56:57.622 --> 57:01.919
have been really,

56:57.622 --> 57:01.919
really supportive.

57:01.960 --> 57:05.547
I think that once maybe

57:01.960 --> 57:05.547
the fraternities find out,

57:05.589 --> 57:09.218
then that could be bad.

57:09.260 --> 57:13.597
It's called Collegiate ACB,

57:09.260 --> 57:13.597
and there are all

57:09.260 --> 57:13.597
of these fraternities

57:13.638 --> 57:16.683
that post on it about, like,

57:13.638 --> 57:16.683
"Who's the most attractive?

57:16.725 --> 57:19.728
"Which house is

57:16.725 --> 57:19.728
the best house?"

57:16.725 --> 57:19.728
Or people that say,

57:19.770 --> 57:23.440
"I was raped at

57:19.770 --> 57:23.440
Sigma Chi last weekend."

57:19.770 --> 57:23.440
Or "I was raped at Tke once."

57:26.818 --> 57:28.486
SOFIE KARASEK: Oh, my God.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.486
I don't know.

57:28.528 --> 57:31.823
I did not think I was gonna be

57:28.528 --> 57:31.823
on this stupid site.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.491
Well, also how they

57:31.865 --> 57:33.491
spelled your name, though.

57:33.533 --> 57:34.952
I know. "Sofiem Karasekem"?

57:34.993 --> 57:36.536
(ALL LAUGHING)

57:36.578 --> 57:38.956
Whatever that means.

57:36.578 --> 57:38.956
They wrote my name...

57:38.997 --> 57:41.458
They wrote it in Latin.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.458
I don't understand.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.458
Probably search it?

SOFIE: Interesting.

58:10.570 --> 58:12.697
CAITLIN FLANAGAN:   The American

58:10.570 --> 58:12.697
fraternity industry spans

58:12.739 --> 58:14.699
thousands of

58:12.739 --> 58:14.699
American colleges,

58:14.741 --> 58:18.203
from the most elite,

58:14.741 --> 58:18.203
private ivy

58:14.741 --> 58:18.203
league institutions

58:18.245 --> 58:19.663
to small regional colleges.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.710
We all know about

58:23.000 --> 58:25.710
inflicted trauma from hazing.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.546
But it's a matter

58:25.752 --> 58:28.546
of public record

58:28.588 --> 58:31.549
that the second

58:28.588 --> 58:31.549
most common type

58:31.591 --> 58:33.260
of insurance claim against

58:31.591 --> 58:33.260
the fraternity industry

58:33.302 --> 58:35.637
is for sexual assault.

58:35.679 --> 58:37.514
I don't want to

58:35.679 --> 58:37.514
single out fraternities

58:37.555 --> 58:39.391
because it's actually

58:37.555 --> 58:39.391
a minority of fraternities,

58:39.433 --> 58:42.019
but what you inevitably get

58:39.433 --> 58:42.019
are certain fraternities

58:42.060 --> 58:45.563
where the sexual assault

58:42.060 --> 58:45.563
is really rampant.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.899
MAN 5:   Within just, say,

58:45.605 --> 58:47.899
the last five to 10 years,

58:47.941 --> 58:50.277
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's

58:47.941 --> 58:50.277
had a number of problems.

58:50.319 --> 58:54.114
SAE is known at

58:50.319 --> 58:54.114
a lot of places

58:50.319 --> 58:54.114
as "Sexual Assault Expected."

58:54.156 --> 58:56.074
Sexual Assault Expected.

58:56.116 --> 58:57.951
Sexual Assault Expected.

58:57.993 --> 58:59.661
SAE. Sexual Assault Expected.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.246
Is there any,

58:59.703 --> 59:01.246
like, parties or places

59:01.288 --> 59:02.622
that you've been

59:01.288 --> 59:02.622
warned not to go?

59:02.664 --> 59:04.082
Yes, SAE.

59:04.124 --> 59:05.750
ALL: Sexual Assault Expected.

59:04.124 --> 59:05.750
(LAUGHS)

59:07.419 --> 59:10.422
WOMAN 6:   Sigma Nu.

59:07.419 --> 59:10.422
SAE. Dke, at the very top.

59:10.464 --> 59:12.549
Those are, like, the main ones

59:10.464 --> 59:12.549
where as a freshman

59:10.464 --> 59:12.549
you're told, like,

59:12.590 --> 59:13.800
"Don't go there."

59:13.842 --> 59:15.511
There's one

59:13.842 --> 59:15.511
fraternity on campus

59:15.552 --> 59:17.637
that is called

59:15.552 --> 59:17.637
"The Date Rape Frat."

59:17.679 --> 59:19.723
Dke is known as

59:17.679 --> 59:19.723
the Roofie Frat.

59:19.764 --> 59:21.808
GIRL:

59:19.764 --> 59:21.808
There is one that was called

59:19.764 --> 59:21.808
the Rape Dungeon.

59:24.602 --> 59:28.232
Once you get a group

59:24.602 --> 59:28.232
of people like this

59:24.602 --> 59:28.232
in that kind of

59:28.273 --> 59:31.109
synergistic kind

59:28.273 --> 59:31.109
of culture forming,

59:31.151 --> 59:34.321
it intensifies this problem.

59:34.363 --> 59:38.242
Pledges at

59:34.363 --> 59:38.242
a fraternity at Yale

59:34.363 --> 59:38.242
surrounded the dorm

59:38.283 --> 59:42.037
where many of the freshman

59:38.283 --> 59:42.037
girls lived,

59:38.283 --> 59:42.037
at night, shouting...

59:42.079 --> 59:44.956
(MALE STUDENTS CHANTING)

59:44.998 --> 59:47.459
MALE STUDENTS:

59:44.998 --> 59:47.459
"No" means "yes!"

59:44.998 --> 59:47.459
"Yes" means "anal!"

59:47.501 --> 59:48.544
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

59:50.337 --> 59:51.963
ALL: "No" means "yes!"

59:50.337 --> 59:51.963
"Yes" means "anal!"

59:52.005 --> 59:54.674
I ended up pledging SAE,

59:52.005 --> 59:54.674
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

59:54.716 --> 59:58.303
It's one of the largest

59:54.716 --> 59:58.303
national fraternities,

59:58.345 --> 01:00:02.349
somewhat notorious

59:58.345 --> 01:00:02.349
for its bad reputation.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.060
Every Wednesday

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.060
night we would have

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.060
what we would call meetings

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:09.231
where all the brothers,

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:09.231
usually about 70 if

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:09.231
all were in attendance,

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:13.277
would gather in the basement

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:13.277
and begin a highly

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:13.277
structured ritual

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.696
exchanging stories

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.696
of sexual conquest.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.366
If a brother had had

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.366
anal sex with a woman,

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:20.951
that would be mentioned,

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.454
and that would be a kind of

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.454
a pat-on-the-back moment.

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.081
And I think that

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.081
that's something

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:26.081
that the women at Dartmouth

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.167
who hooked up with

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.167
the fraternity brothers

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.167
didn't really know.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:33.088
That guy who tried

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:33.088
to sexually assault me at ATO,

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.381
he was a pledge

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.381
at the time, right?

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:37.342
And so, all the pledges

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:37.342
had to, like,

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:41.805
photograph girls without

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:41.805
anything on their tops, right?

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:42.847
WOMAN 7: What?

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.182
Had to photograph

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.182
shirtless girls.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.976
I hate that.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.976
And so,

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.976
apparently in the basement

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:50.730
there were pictures of girls

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:50.730
and just, like, their tits.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.985
And apparently

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.985
this kid who was,

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.985
like, so pushy with me,

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.487
he had, like,

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.487
the most pictures of girls.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.447
So, when he comes at me,

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:01.116
his behavior of

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:01.116
being sexually aggressive

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:01.116
gets rewarded by his brothers.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.834
DOUG FIERBERG:

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.834
Fraternities are essentially

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.834
unregulated bars.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.920
And the individuals

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.920
that are responsible

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.920
for managing that alcohol

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.673
are themselves legally

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.673
incapable of consuming it.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.759
Most sororities

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.759
don't throw parties,

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.553
because you can't

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.553
have alcohol at all

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:24.139
on the premises,

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:24.139
even if you're over 21.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.767
So, if sorority

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.767
women want to drink

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.767
or go to a party even, at all,

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.561
they have to do

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.561
it at a fraternity

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.731
where the fraternity

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.731
brothers control

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.731
the dispersion of alcohol.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.485
Usually, the drinks

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.485
had Everclear in them.

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:37.986
INTERVIEWER: What's Everclear?

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:42.866
It's a very strong

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:42.866
form of alcohol, and I...

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:44.368
The reason why they

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:44.368
put it in there is

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.411
because it would

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.411
get you drunk quickly.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.912
The idea would

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.912
be to get everyone

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.665
so incredibly intoxicated,

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.665
you know,

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.749
blackout drunk,

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.749
that would increase the

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.210
chances that people

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.210
would be getting laid.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.382
There was certainly something

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.382
predatory about it.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:01:59.883
The fraternity

01:01:58.423 --> 01:01:59.883
brothers took great pride

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.093
in having

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:02.093
a predator/prey relationship

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.888
with the women that would come

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.888
to these parties.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.765
So, I was at

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.765
a fraternity party.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.393
I went to a fraternity.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.770
I went to

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.770
a fraternity party at MIT.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:16.774
I'd never really, I guess,

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:16.774
been in a situation like that.

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:22.197
He came up to me and

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:22.197
we started talking.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.574
He was just this guy

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.574
I thought was cute,

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.825
and then we were

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.825
just dancing at Fiji.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.413
This big frat

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.413
brother came up to me

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.413
and he put his arm around me,

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.790
and he took me

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.790
away from my friends,

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.790
but he was really nice.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:37.754
A friend, at the time, um,

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:37.754
really fed me a lot of drinks.

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:40.757
He said,

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:40.757
"Why don't we go outside?"

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.175
He asked if I

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.175
wanted to go upstairs.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.343
We went upstairs.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.803
And he invited me

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.803
to go into a room.

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:47.055
He took me

01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:47.055
downstairs to their basement.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.352
He pinned me against the wall,

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.352
and took off my clothes,

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.938
and assaulted me.

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:58.275
That's when they

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:58.275
both assaulted me.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.277
I was assaulted by

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.277
at least two members

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.277
of their fraternity.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.700
It's extremely difficult,

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:09.160
if not impossible,

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:09.160
to get accurate information

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.122
about whether or

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.122
not there have been

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.122
sexual assaults

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.916
in a particular

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.916
fraternity house.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.793
What you find in many

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.793
circumstances is that

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.087
universities have

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.087
created contractual

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.131
relationships

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.131
with fraternities

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.800
that involve them

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.800
promoting the fraternities,

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:26.136
but not then also disclosing

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.846
the risks that they've had

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.846
with those fraternities.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.015
On the Johns Hopkins

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.015
University campus today,

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.561
following

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.561
allegations of a gang rape

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.561
at an off campus fraternity.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:35.853
Students say the university

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.189
failed to tell students

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.189
about the investigation.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.651
Problem after

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.651
problem after problem

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:44.321
for the Sigma Alpha

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:44.321
Epsilon fraternity at UNM.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:47.407
And that was before

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:47.407
a new claim of rape.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.201
REPORTER 7:   Digging for

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.201
answers after the same

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:50.201
Yale frat house

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.828
has had a whole

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.828
bunch of problems.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:54.414
I'm telling you,

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:54.414
almost every time

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.333
there's a rape in

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.333
a fraternity chapter,

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.418
there's someone

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.418
at the university,

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.796
certainly the person

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.796
who's in the office of

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.796
Greek residence life,

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.255
who's paid for

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.255
by the university,

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.215
he or she knew

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.135
that that chapter was likely

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.135
to have a rape sometime.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.471
But they won't

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.471
tell the young women.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.890
Or if they do,

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.890
there's hell to pay

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.890
for these college presidents.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:14.476
It's happened at Wesleyan.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.145
There was

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.145
a problem fraternity,

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.145
Beta Theta Pi.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.105
The university sent

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.105
a letter in the spring

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.857
to all students

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.857
and all parents.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.159
The fraternity went ballistic.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.911
The parents of

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.911
the fraternity brothers

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.911
went ballistic,

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.831
and the new class of

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.831
freshman women came in,

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.081
and they didn't

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.081
send the warning to

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.416
the new class of

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.416
freshman women.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.710
It was Halloween weekend

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.003
before a girl was

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.003
violently raped upstairs.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.338
Frat house at

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.338
Wesleyan University

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.549
is facing

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.549
a lawsuit by a student

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.133
who claims she was raped.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.845
And this isn't the first time

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.845
that frat has come under fire.

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:54.015
CAITLIN:   After that rape,

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:54.015
a young woman shows up

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.560
at an emergency room

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.560
in Middletown, Connecticut.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.436
"I was assaulted

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.436
at Beta Theta Pi."

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.941
It's to me

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.941
outrageous the extent

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.902
that our colleges

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.902
and universities

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:09.030
are complicit in

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:09.030
the sexual assault

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.825
of young women at

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.825
these fraternity houses.

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.034
INTERVIEWER:

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.034
So, why don't the schools

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.203
just disassociate themselves

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.203
from the fraternities

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.955
and kick them off campus?

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.041
Right. Well,

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.041
the colleges and universities

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.043
have much more to gain

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.043
from the fraternities

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.503
than the fraternities

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.503
have to gain

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:24.796
from the colleges

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:24.796
and universities.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.094
One out of every

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.094
eight college students

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.764
living on campus

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.764
lives in Greek housing.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.766
That's a tremendous

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.766
amount of housing stock

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.810
the colleges

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.810
don't have to pay for,

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:38.810
don't have to supervise.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.353
You also have to remember

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:43.690
you tie alumni to your campus

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:43.690
in a very powerful way

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.108
when you have

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.108
a fraternity system.

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:46.192
(BOTH YELLING IN EXCITEMENT)

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.947
Alumni giving

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.947
is a massive part

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.947
of your annual giving,

01:05:50.988 --> 01:05:53.408
and a large part of that

01:05:50.988 --> 01:05:53.408
is fraternity membership.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:04.961
CAITLIN:   It's a deeply

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:04.961
powerful industry.

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:07.004
You start tracing

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:07.004
back and you find out

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:09.841
they're pouring money

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:09.841
into political campaigns,

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.594
and they're

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.594
hugely overrepresented.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.137
There's no

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.137
college or university,

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:16.264
or type of

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:16.264
college or university

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.767
that's more

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.767
represented within Congress

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:22.479
than the fraternity

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:22.479
system itself is.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.773
So, people are very

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.773
loathed to get involved

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.983
and very loathed to come up

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.983
against the fraternity system.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.405
ANNIE: Checklist?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.405
Phone charger?

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:33.698
ANDREA: Mmm-hmm.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.783
ANNIE: Laptop?

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.783
ANDREA: Mmm-hmm.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.417
ANNIE:   It's not

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.417
a coincidence that you can

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.919
fly to Boston and

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.919
fly to California

01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:47.587
and hear the same stories.

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.591
ANDREA:   We started

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.591
visiting other campuses.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.259
We felt that if

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.259
we created a model

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.678
for how to file

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.678
a  Title IX   Complaint,

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.220
others would do it.

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:13.196
These are our two fraternities

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:13.196
where a student was

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:13.196
sexually assaulted.

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:15.866
ANDREA:   And it was going there

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:15.866
and being walked

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:15.866
to the fraternities

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.785
and being walked to where

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.785
their assaults had happened.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.245
You know,

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.245
details that were critical

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.245
for every single case.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:24.040
Weird, right?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.836
WOMAN 8: So, for the email

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.836
I'm just gonna...

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:31.130
ANNIE:   So we move forward

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:31.130
with this model saying,

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:31.130
"Here's a complaint.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.590
"Here's how this

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.590
process works."

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.802
ANDREA:   My 21st birthday,

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:38.930
I was helping

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:38.930
students at Swarthmore

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:38.930
file a  Title IX   Complaint.

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.192
ANNIE: So, I think,

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.192
I went to Columbia twice

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:51.192
before they filed.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.360
Just sat down with

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.360
a group of students

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.988
and talked them through

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.988
how to file a complaint.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.408
If people are

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.408
going to talk publicly,

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.036
then it needs

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.036
to be about their

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.036
treatment here at Columbia.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.787
Focus on Columbia.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.787
WOMAN 9: Yeah.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.457
ANNIE:   We don't have lawyers.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.457
You have

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.457
18-19-year-old students

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.294
who are standing up

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.294
to their institutions.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:13.297
We are at Amherst,

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:13.297
and we found a place to stay.

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:14.465
(LAUGHS)

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.091
Hi, Drea.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.720
Where we sleeping tonight?

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.096
Out on the least

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.096
terrifying parking lot.

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:22.682
(ANNIE LAUGHS)

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.102
And we are

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.102
changing and doing stuff

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:26.102
in a Wendy's bathroom. Yay.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.241
I found politicizing

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:44.746
my own experience

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:44.746
to be actually

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:44.746
the most helpful step.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.041
SOFIE:   It's really

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.041
exciting to actually get to

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.041
meet the other activists.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.836
I had felt so cared for,

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.836
until I actually needed Yale,

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:54.839
at which point I became this,

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:54.839
like, administrative matter.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.509
The administration

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.509
kept telling us to,

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:58.509
"Take our foot off the pedal."

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.398
Hi.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.398
ANNIE: Hi.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.024
Nice to meet you. I'm Annie.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.902
I'm Rachel. Nice to meet you.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.902
Nice to meet you.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.571
I just decided to

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.571
take some time off, kind of.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:21.698
I moved here with my sister,

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:21.698
and I've been a nanny

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.326
and it's the most

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.326
amazing thing, so...

01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:24.911
ANNIE: That's so cool. Yeah.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:30.750
And, seeing the two

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:30.750
little girls

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:30.750
that I nanny for, I like...

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.420
One of the reasons

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.420
I've wanted to do this

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.420
is, like, I never want...

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:41.886
Them to ever have to deal with

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:41.886
something like this.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.349
So, it's really late,

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:51.104
and, um, we have

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:51.104
a survivor who's cutting,

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.648
and she doesn't

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.648
know if she can stop.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.359
(WOMAN ON PHONE SOBBING)

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.987
ANDREA:   The worst

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.987
part for me has been

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.823
having to

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.823
relive the experience

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:01.823
of everybody else.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.993
This vicarious

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.993
trauma that I couldn't

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.993
process anymore.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.369
It's just not fair.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:08.997
It's really not fair.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:14.961
But it's the only way

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:14.961
I get up in the morning.

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.338
I would've given

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.338
anything to have had

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.338
someone who believed me,

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.090
someone who supported me.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.557

Hi. Good to meet you.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:39.485
I was raped by

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:39.485
a basketball player

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:39.485
at the University of Tulsa.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:42.197
And I felt like

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:42.197
because he was an athlete,

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:46.159
everyone was

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:46.159
acting like he's worth

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.870
more than I am

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:48.870
because he's an athlete.

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:52.123
And that's what happens

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:52.123
over and over and over again.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.209
It's, like, you need

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.209
to re-read your

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.209
mission statement.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.626

"Or are you here to educate

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.754
and protect your students?"

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.218
An alleged sexual assault case

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.218
involving three

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.218

REPORTER 8:   Derrick

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.641
Washington already had

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.641
a documented history

It was former Michigan kicker

Brendan Gibbons

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:19.275
involved in

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:19.275
the alleged sexual assault

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:19.275
of a woman back in 2009.

01:11:19.316 --> 01:11:21.318
This is the fifth

01:11:19.316 --> 01:11:21.318
student athlete

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.987
to be accused of

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.987
sexual assault on campus.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.457
DON MCPHERSON:   I really do

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.457
believe the vast majority

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.457
of student athletes

01:11:34.498 --> 01:11:36.292
are worthy of our admiration.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.586
I think they're mostly,

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.586
for the most part,

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.379
a lot of good people out there

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.379
who are trying to

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.379
do the right thing.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.174
But when you have

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:47.137
18 to 22-year-old

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:47.137
kids who are celebrities,

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:51.307
it creates a toxic environment

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:51.307
for a lot of bad behavior.

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.851
When they walk across campus,

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.063
it's not like

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.063
any other student

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.063
walking across campus.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.065
There's a multi-billion-dollar

industry

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:01.067

these young men,

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.903
and if you don't

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.903
think that they're part

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.903
of a culture of entitlement,

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.322
just look at the fanfare

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.322
that's around

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:06.322

in Zephyrhills, Florida.

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.721
It's a small town,

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.721
so everybody

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.721
does know everybody.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:35.185

my entire life.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:38.146

in high school.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:38.146
I graduated with honors.

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:41.858
I took a lot of AP

a family friend

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.737
of ours gave me

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:49.157

any father could have.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.581
She was fabulous.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:01.211
Never any problems.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:01.211
Always had a great smile.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:04.380
Just a joy to be around.

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:07.633
She kept saying she was going

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:07.633
to FSU, going to FSU,

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.802
and then when she

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.802
first got there,

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.929
I knew she made

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.929
the right choice.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.308
My first

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.308
semester was really...

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.060
It was a lot of

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.060
science classes.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:19.770
I was in six classes.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.814
I wanted to go to med school.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:25.068
I didn't go out a lot

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:25.068
just because I was

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:25.068
in a lot of classes.

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:31.908
So, it was

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:31.908
the week before finals,

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:31.908
and we drove to Potbelly's,

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.661
and we were just hanging out.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:38.455
This guy started

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:38.455
following me around,

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:42.377
and I, like,

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:42.377
said to him, "What? Stop."

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:42.377
You know, "Stop following us."

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.838
And a man standing at the bar

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.550
saw that I was uncomfortable

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.550
with this guy following me,

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.053
and so, he kind of like,

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.053
grabbed me and was like,

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:55.139
"This is my girlfriend.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:55.139
Leave her alone."

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.682
And I was like, "Thank you."

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.976
The guy left,

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.976
and I was just like,

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.976
"Thank you."

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:02.313
And he's like,

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:02.313
"Do you wanna take a shot?"

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:02.313
And I said, "Sure."

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.775
So, I turned around, like,

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.775
to make sure that

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.775
this guy was gone

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.069
and when I turned back around

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.069
he handed me a shot.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.367
I'm fairly

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.367
certain that there was

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.367
something in that drink.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:18.079
As a college student,

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:18.079
I had been drunk before,

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.706
and I had not

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:20.706
drank nearly enough

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:23.834
to become drunk

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:23.834
and incompetent that night.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:31.467
I remember being in a cab,

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:31.467
and there were three

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:31.467
guys in the cab also.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.804
Anyone you ask

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.804
would tell you, like,

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.931
I never would go

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.931
home with a guy, period,

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.934
and especially

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.934
not three people

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.934
that I didn't know.

01:14:41.436 --> 01:14:43.271
I remember specific

01:14:41.436 --> 01:14:43.271
things after that.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.274
I was in an apartment,

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.485
and this guy was...

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.657
Sexually assaulting me.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.657
He was raping me.

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.493
He was on top of me,

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.493
and I couldn't

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.493
really breathe that much,

01:14:57.534 --> 01:15:00.330
but I was saying,

01:14:57.534 --> 01:15:00.330
"Please stop. Stop."

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:05.960
Like, I remember his roommate

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:05.960
or whoever this other guy was,

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.630
came in and he was saying,

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.630
"Dude, stop.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.630
Like, what are you doing?

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.382
"She's telling you to stop."

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.136
Since his door to the bedroom

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.136
wouldn't lock,

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:19.598
he picked me up

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:19.598
and he carried me

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:19.598
into the bathroom.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.767
He said,

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.767
"The door will lock in here."

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:26.939
He put me on

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:26.939
the tile bathroom floor.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.026
I was trying to, like,

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.026
push him off,

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.026
and kick him off,

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.028
but he was just too big.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:35.531
And I said, "Please stop,"

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:35.531
multiple times,

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:35.531
and I said, "No".

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:38.659
Eventually he pushed

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:38.659
his hand over my face

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.703
and pushed my

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.703
face into the floor.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:45.541
And he just

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:45.541
continued to rape me.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.880
He finished and then he put

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.880
my clothes back on,

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:54.591
and he said,

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:54.591
"You can leave now."

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:58.012
And then he's like,

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:58.012
"I'll take you

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:58.012
home on my scooter."

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:01.349
I mean, okay.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:01.349
I had no idea where I was.

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.226
I didn't know how else

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:03.226
I was supposed to get home.

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:06.187
I wanted to get out of there.

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:09.982
This was the worst

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:09.982
feeling because

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:12.651
I didn't wanna hold

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:12.651
onto him, you know?

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:16.906
But I was afraid that I was

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:16.906
gonna fall off of the scooter.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.242
He dropped me off

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.242
at the intersection

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.242
where I told him

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.953
because I didn't

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.953
want him to know

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.953
where I lived.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:26.582
I didn't know, really,

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:26.582
what I was supposed to do.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.378
I tweeted, "Someone help me."

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.009
My friend responded,

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.009
and she was like,

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.009
"Well, tell me what happened."

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:39.845
And we decided that

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:39.845
we need to call the police.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.014
(TALKING OVER THE PHONE)

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.063
The Florida State

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.063
University police

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.316
took me in

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.316
the back of a police car

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.316
to the hospital.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:57.113
I got all of the blood work,

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.573
and the rape kit,

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.573
and everything.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.533
They were

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.533
watching bruises appear

01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:02.659
as I was laying in

01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:02.659
the hospital bed.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:05.496
We got a call about

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:05.496
3:00 in the morning.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:08.165
We grabbed some stuff

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:08.165
and we jumped in the car

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.626
and started heading to FSU

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.626
as quick as we could.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:16.132
She was laying in

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:16.132
the hospital bed,

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:16.132
and we each went to one side,

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:19.218
and we just held

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:19.218
her and all three

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:19.218
of us laid there,

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.178
or sat there and cried.

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.891
ERICA:   That's when

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.891
investigator Angulo came in.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:29.479
And I told him

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:29.479
kind of everything.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.065
I'm very pro law enforcement.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:34.733
And Tallahassee PD was there,

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:37.111
and we assumed they were

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:37.111
taking care of things.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.352
ERICA:   I went back

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.352
in the beginning of January.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:11.604
It was my first

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:11.604
class on Tuesday,

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:14.649
and I see him

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:14.649
walk into the class.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.901
And I knew.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.901
I was like, "That's him."

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.820
They were about

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.820
to take attendance

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.820
and that's what...

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:24.116
I needed to stay calm

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:24.116
and just kind of wait it out.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:28.287
He was one of

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:28.287
the very last names

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:28.287
that they called,

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:32.833
and, um, my teacher said,

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:32.833
"Jameis Winston?"

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:32.833
and he raised his hand.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.127
I didn't know who he was.

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:43.802
you chose Florida State.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.347
Just because we're trying to

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.347
build a tradition there

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.683
and hopefully we can get

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.683
a few national championships

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.934
and hopefully

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.934
a Heisman Trophy.

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:55.731
point he knew that

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:58.817
he was gonna be

the big football star.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.320

01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:14.542
sense to me, really.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:18.879

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.523
is on the verge

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.523
of leading his team

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.024
to the ultimate victory.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:24.069
Our main goal is to

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:24.069
win a national championship.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.196
REPORTER 11:   He's had

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.196
a meteoric rise to fame,

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.241
becoming

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.241
the starting quarterback

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.241
as a freshman.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:31.994
He's a star on the team,

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:31.994
and that doesn't

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:31.994
mean he's guilty,

01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:33.746
but the point is

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:38.041
you have to treat that person

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:38.041
like you would anyone

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:38.041
else in these cases,

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.252
and that didn't happen here.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:43.673
Poised to play in and possibly

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:43.673
win the national championship,

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:46.008
a frontrunner for

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:46.008
the Heisman Trophy award,

01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:47.926
Florida State quarterback,

01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:47.926
Jameis Winston,

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.180
now possibly finds himself

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.180
in some hot water.

01:20:51.221 --> 01:20:53.557
Winston is part of

01:20:51.221 --> 01:20:53.557
an ongoing investigation

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:57.186
into a sexual

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:57.186
assault complaint

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:57.186
filed nearly a year ago,

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:00.731
but today was turned over

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:00.731
to the State Attorney.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.608
As soon as I saw

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.608
this story break,

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:07.655
I thought how terribly,

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:07.655
terribly unfair it

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:07.655
is to this young man.

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:10.825
I think it's very,

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:10.825
very unfortunate

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:10.825
that this young dude

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.868
with this Magic

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.868
Johnson caliber smile...

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:13.994
MAN 6: Yup.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.621
...and a level of production,

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:16.913
and the things

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:16.913
that he has done

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.583
en route to pursuing

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.583
a national championship,

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.878
and the Heisman Trophy,

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.878
and now it comes out?

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.381
It just stinks to me.

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:35.932
DNA analysis confirmed

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:35.932
the DNA provided by Winston

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.602
matched that sample

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.602
taken from the accuser.

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:43.774
Although,

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:43.774
he has never spoken directly

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:43.774
to cops or prosecutors,

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:47.027
Jameis Winston,

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:47.027
through his attorneys,

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:47.027
maintains his innocence

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:50.947
and says any sex

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:50.947
was consensual.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.492
COMMENTATOR 2:   Jameis Winston!

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.492
He's into the promised land!

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.369
Touchdown, FSU!

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:59.874
REPORTER 12:

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:59.874
His voice, his way, his team.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.835
ERICA:   Our football team

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.835
kept winning games.

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:05.254
We were gonna play

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:05.254
in the national championship.

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.592
All these people

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:09.592
were praising him.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:14.555
People were just

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:14.555
calling me names,

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:14.555
a slut, a whore.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:18.893
I got a tweet

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:18.893
from a girl who I didn't know.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.436
The tweet was like,

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:24.481
"Why would you blame

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:24.481
such a good guy

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:24.481
for doing this?"

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:29.069
People were

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:29.069
threatening me, my family.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:32.615
And there was other people

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:32.615
that were

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:32.615
threatening my sorority,

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.909
saying, "We're gonna burn down

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:34.909
their house."

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.622

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.622
Jameis Winston will not be

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.622
charged with the rape

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.416
that allegedly happened

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.416
exactly a year ago.

Here's prosecutor

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:49.632
We've carefully examined

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:49.632
all the evidence in this case

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:52.968
and have

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:52.968
concluded that no charges

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:56.972
will be filed against

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:56.972
anyone in this case.

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:59.266
INTERVIEWER: Do you think

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:59.266
Jameis Winston

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:59.266
raped that girl?

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.309
Uh...

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:04.438
I think I did not

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:04.438
have sufficient evidence

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.067
to prove that he

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.067
sexually assaulted her

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.067
against her will.

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:16.784
I think things

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:16.784
that happened there

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:16.784
that night were not good.

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.329

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.289
the alleged victim

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.289
drops out of school.

The justice system

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.767
was proved right.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.767
Right? It worked.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.109
Some girl got jealous

01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:53.028

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.823
She was a liar.

Florida state quarterback,

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.620
had the game of

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.620
his young life Monday

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:03.789

Sexual assault cases

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:33.777
are always tough.

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:36.906
Probably the first time

someone is apprehended

and the sad thing about that

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:52.106

but it's also

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:05.911
revenue in terms of

01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:41.738
with the big

01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:41.738
business of college sports.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:45.492
There is a great fear

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:45.492
among many presidents

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:49.579
of alienating important,

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:49.579
influential people.

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.959
What's the number

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.959
one responsibility

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.959
of a college president?

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.628
Fundraising.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:59.214
$100 million to UC San Diego,

01:26:59.255 --> 01:27:01.299
the second largest gift

01:26:59.255 --> 01:27:01.299
in the school's history.

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:03.844
$200 million.

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.637
That's the gift

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.637
University of Michigan

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.764
alum Stephen Ross has

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.764
given to the school.

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.307
Harvard

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.307
University has received

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.768
the largest donation

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.768
in the school's history,

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:14.479
$350 million.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.148
Good Lord,

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.148
that's a lot of money, Joe.

01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:19.401
DANIELLE DIRKS:

01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:19.401
Colleges are big business.

01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:22.071
They have boards

01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:22.071
that are trying to

01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:22.071
maintain their endowments,

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.198
and they don't want anything

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.198
that's going to touch that.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.282
This is about

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.282
millions and billions

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.326
of dollars being

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.326
spent every year

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.620
to keep this

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.620
institution running.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:35.042
Harvard is in the midst

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:35.042
of a $6 billion

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:35.042
capital campaign.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.921
Donors might be

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.921
troubled if they understood

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.840
the magnitude

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.840
of sexual assault

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.840
on the campus.

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:45.094
I think that's

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:45.094
part of the effort to

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:45.094
silence the problem.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.890
Numerous times

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.890
I was taken aside

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.392
by a senior tenured

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.392
female faculty person

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.103
and told the way to

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:54.103
make it at Harvard

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:56.021
is by being

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:56.021
a dutiful daughter.

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:58.857
"If you hear it,

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:58.857
pretend you didn't.

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.069
"If you see it,

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.069
you shut up about it.

01:28:02.111 --> 01:28:03.278
"Silence."

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.054
There's a reason

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.054
we haven't seen

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.054
more faculty involved.

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:33.142
It does harm your career

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:33.142
in ways that you

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:33.142
can't even predict.

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:35.560
Certainly if you're untenured,

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:35.560
but even if you are tenured,

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.271
it makes it

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.271
much more difficult

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.981
to move from one

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.981
institution to the next

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:41.650
if you've been branded

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:41.650
an activist or a troublemaker.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.359
I've had the honor

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.359
to work with students

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:44.987
who've been asking

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:44.987
these kinds of questions

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.947
for the five years

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:46.947
that I've been here.

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:48.448
We heard that

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:48.448
things were gonna happen,

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.659
but then there was

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.659
no conversation about it.

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.453
And I think there's a huge gap

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.453
in between that

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.453
still needs to,

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.331
A, be bridged, and to be

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.331
discussed more publicly.

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:20.730
I feel like there's

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:20.730
this moral high ground

01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:20.730
in higher education

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.524
that is just sitting vacant.

01:29:22.565 --> 01:29:27.112
What I haven't yet seen

01:29:22.565 --> 01:29:27.112
anywhere, that I'm aware of,

01:29:27.154 --> 01:29:30.824
is a president who has decided

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:34.369
that whatever it takes,

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:34.369
it has to be done.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.413
And that's what leadership is.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:40.500
...that we would

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:40.500
tolerate for one moment

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.795
sexual violence and

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.795
intimidation on our campus.

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:46.965
These assumptions

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:46.965
are patently false,

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:50.135
and such speculations

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:50.135
are very, very inappropriate.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.701
At the end of the day,

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.701
I think we share

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.701
all the same goals,

01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:59.204
which is to

01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:59.204
create a safe place

01:30:59.246 --> 01:31:01.415
where all our

01:30:59.246 --> 01:31:01.415
students can thrive.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.763
Of your 25

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.763
possible complainants,

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.932
how many of

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.932
them are survivors?

01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:20.392
Twenty.

01:31:21.684 --> 01:31:23.228
ANNIE: How many are

01:31:21.684 --> 01:31:23.228
willing to go public?

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:28.108
Um, probably five.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.734
So, what about just

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.734
a press conference?

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.485
Yeah. That I think

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.485
could be good.

SOFIE:

01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:46.042
Good morning, and thank you

01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:46.042

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.556
I'm a survivor of

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:00.556
a sexual assault

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:03.018
that occurred

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:03.018

"The process that

01:32:07.647 --> 01:32:09.316
followed is far more

Several female students say

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:33.673
they were sexually assaulted

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.758

of California campus,

but they weren't

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.469
taken seriously.

01:32:38.845 --> 01:32:40.554

01:32:38.845 --> 01:32:40.554
the media frame

01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:42.057
and how it changed,

01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:42.057
and where it spiked,

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.142

assault victims

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:52.734
Their efforts are

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:52.734
gaining the attention...

ANNIE:   We saw what was

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:55.028
effective, and that was

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:55.028
personal narrative,

with a more personal account

of the kind of
