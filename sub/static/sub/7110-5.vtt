WEBVTT

00:56.357 --> 00:59.727
So are you and Syd
really doing it?

00:59.793 --> 01:02.930
Yes, we are.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.733
And you actually
like it?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.401
Yes.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.604
Yeah, so what, you just--
you just changed?

01:12.039 --> 01:15.709
I don't know. I just...
crossed a line

01:15.776 --> 01:18.179
that I guess I always had
there for some reason.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.148
I don't know why.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.616
Also, I've realized I just--

01:22.683 --> 01:24.885
I can't have real
emotional intimacy

01:24.952 --> 01:27.588
with somebody who hasn't
suffered under patriarchy.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.157
- [scoff]
- No, I'm serious.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.324
Oh, God.

01:30.391 --> 01:31.892
All these years
it's just been--

01:31.959 --> 01:33.394
You're a lesbian

01:33.461 --> 01:36.830
because I don't give
two fucks about patriarchy.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.937
Do you think it matters

01:44.004 --> 01:46.174
who you think about
when you come?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.642
Like, if you think about
men, you're straight,

01:48.709 --> 01:51.712
and if you think
about women, you're gay.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.846
No.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.014
No?

01:54.081 --> 01:55.316
Mm-mm.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.219
I think people think
about all kinds of things.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.689
You know who's been clogging
up my mindscape lately?

02:01.755 --> 02:02.856
Who?

02:04.492 --> 02:07.428
Mr. Irons
and his paddle.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.465
Oh, God. You fuck
Mr. Irons in your fantasy?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.434
No, no. He's just there.

02:13.501 --> 02:18.206
He's watching me,
telling me what to do.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.007
I'm really sorry about that.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.275
[laughing]

02:21.342 --> 02:23.211
I know, right?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.878
** [theme]

03:09.723 --> 03:12.426
Wait. Your family is
driving all the way here

03:12.493 --> 03:14.395
just to sign
the high school papers?

03:14.462 --> 03:17.030
Uh, they don't really trust
the U.S. Postal Service.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.065
What about FedEx?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.767
[chuckle]
Okay, Colton,

03:19.833 --> 03:21.569
what-- what--
what's going on?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.271
Okay, so they were cool
with me coming out here

03:23.304 --> 03:24.538
for a couple of weeks,
right,

03:24.605 --> 03:25.973
to meet Rita
and to meet you,

03:26.039 --> 03:27.841
but, you know, they,
like we talked about,

03:27.908 --> 03:28.942
you know, I, you know,

03:29.009 --> 03:31.011
kind of decided that I
want to stay for longer,

03:31.078 --> 03:32.713
and when I was
talking to them

03:32.780 --> 03:34.615
on the phone the other day,
maybe, I don't know,

03:34.682 --> 03:36.284
I guess they heard
something in my voice,

03:36.284 --> 03:38.652
but, you know, they-- now they
want to meet both of you,

03:38.719 --> 03:40.788
you know, and--
and I'm really sorry

03:40.854 --> 03:42.990
because I know I should
have told you earlier,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.492
and I have that.
That's my bad--

03:44.558 --> 03:46.093
- Okay.
- ...but, you know, it's--

03:46.159 --> 03:47.728
- Okay. It's good.
- ...this all happened so fast.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.597
Everything's going to be
fine, so you can chill.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.299
Raquel:
Okay, so, uh...

03:52.666 --> 03:55.303
who-- who are we meeting,
Mom and Dad?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.770
Well, yeah, Pappy,

03:56.837 --> 03:59.307
but I guess you can
call him Pastor Gene

03:59.373 --> 04:01.041
- or just Gene, you know.
- Okay.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.476
And I call Mama "Mama,"

04:02.543 --> 04:03.777
but you can
call her Blossie,

04:03.844 --> 04:05.313
- Okay.
- ...and, you know,

04:05.346 --> 04:06.580
my sister Becky
and my brother Cliff

04:06.647 --> 04:07.981
are also
going to be here.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.383
Okay. All right. Okay.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.852
Relax. Relax.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.687
And if it's okay
with you guys,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.789
Pappy might need
to hook up the RV
to your septic.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.391
Super.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.761
So I wanted
to just say up front

04:20.828 --> 04:24.698
that the fact that you won
these sessions in an auction

04:24.765 --> 04:26.634
is a little bit of a problem.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.035
What?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.169
I mean, I don't-- Sorry.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.604
Let me try again.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.106
So I think there's
something in all of us,

04:33.173 --> 04:34.975
and this is what I said
in my book,

04:35.042 --> 04:36.209
um, that's a spark,

04:36.344 --> 04:39.179
and the spark inside of us
is like a boom!

04:39.246 --> 04:41.782
And the boom
cries out for us

04:41.849 --> 04:44.952
and starts off
"I need help. I need help.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.520
"I need to make a change.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.356
"I need to make a change.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.823
[louder]
I need to make a change,"

04:49.890 --> 04:51.258
until it gets real big.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.594
And for you, for all
intensive purposes,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.396
your spark was just
handed to you

04:55.463 --> 04:57.998
at a school gala,
so you didn't choose it.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.132
That's not my fault.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.834
It's not "intensive purposes."

05:00.901 --> 05:03.070
Did you say
"intensive purposes"?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.673
It's "Intents and purposes."

05:05.739 --> 05:07.207
- That's not true.
- I--

05:07.274 --> 05:08.208
Well, that you said it or--

05:08.275 --> 05:09.443
Are you pretty controlling?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.944
People say you're
pretty controlling?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.145
No, I'm not controlling.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.781
I mean, I'm just honest,

05:13.847 --> 05:16.384
but-- I mean, I maybe
was a little controlling,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.852
but I'm not.
I mean, I used to be.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.989
I used to have, you know,
the perfect house

05:22.055 --> 05:23.391
and the perfect husband

05:23.391 --> 05:26.159
and these little kids'
aluminum Bento boxes,

05:26.226 --> 05:29.229
you know, like,
for lunches.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.298
And, I mean, I liked
to compartmentalize,

05:31.399 --> 05:32.733
but I don't anymore,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.802
and I'm very--
I'm out there.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.237
I'm living--
I mean, it's a mess.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.172
Everything's
blowing up everywhere.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.474
You know what it
sounds like to me

05:40.541 --> 05:42.743
is a messy life
is what we call clutter.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.645
And it sounds like,
to me, Sadie,

05:44.712 --> 05:46.179
that there's
just so much clutter.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.515
Sarah, but that's okay.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
But I just want
to say something.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.317
I don't really
get the thing

05:50.418 --> 05:52.019
back to the whole, like,
winning the thing.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.286
You-- You donated them.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.855
Now, that sounds
hostile to me,

05:54.922 --> 05:58.792
so I feel like you are
putting up a-- a wall

05:58.859 --> 06:02.262
made of bricks and cement
and all kinds of things

06:02.329 --> 06:05.332
so you can't get through to me
and I can't get through to you.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.934
And by the end
of our sessions together,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.269
we're going to
knock down that wall,

06:09.336 --> 06:10.671
and we're going
to see each other,

06:10.738 --> 06:12.740
and you're
going to feel better.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.313
Oh, my goddess,
oh, my goddess,
oh, my goddess.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.149
- Look, look, look, look.
- And you've never seen this?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.785
No, no. I just sent
all my old photographs

06:24.852 --> 06:28.021
to this kookaburra artist,
and she sent me back these.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.824
- Oh, my God.
- [gasp]

06:30.891 --> 06:32.693
They regendered
the whole photo.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.028
Oh, my God,
is this Baby Davina?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.063
Look at that.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.066
- Look at that face.
- Oh, so cute.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.902
Look at her.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.303
She's pretty.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.972
They changed
my old striped shirt

06:45.038 --> 06:46.740
into a pinafore.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.075
- Look at me.
- Look at my hair.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.276
Look at this.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.511
Let me see your teeth.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.713
They're not the same
anymore.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.848
What's wrong with you?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.116
What are these?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.284
Other pictures, too.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.385
[gasp] Is that you?

06:58.486 --> 06:59.753
That's me.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.723
I'm happier now
than I was back then.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.758
- I'm going to do this.
- Oh, my God.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.027
- Can I take one of these?
- Yeah.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.831
Hello. Hi.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.332
Hi.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.334
Uh, I'm sorry
if this is weird,

07:14.401 --> 07:15.669
but I think you should
be wearing this

07:15.736 --> 07:17.037
when his parents
get here.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.138
What is that?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.573
It's just so that, you know,

07:19.640 --> 07:23.811
we present the right optics
in this situazione.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.513
[sigh]

07:25.546 --> 07:27.214
Optics?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.750
Yeah. Um, you know,
because look,

07:29.817 --> 07:32.252
hey, this thing
is not worthy of you,

07:32.319 --> 07:34.822
but it is, uh,
a family heirloom,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.524
so I'm ye old Jew
on my Dad's side--

07:36.590 --> 07:37.725
That's the wrong finger.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.159
Okay, and--
[chuckles] sorry.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.529
I'm sorry. Is this
your proposal to me?

07:41.562 --> 07:42.563
No. No, no.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.032
No, no. Hell, no.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.133
Okay.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.268
Um, this is, um, not--

07:48.335 --> 07:49.537
it's just a thing.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.838
It's a thing
that goes on the finger

07:50.904 --> 07:52.105
while the people
are here.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.641
I'm not putting it
on my finger.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.908
- No?
- Mm-mm.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.109
Okay. Listen.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.344
You should know, uh,

07:57.410 --> 07:59.680
that I already talked
to the ring guy.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.415
We're mid-design
on the real dealio,

08:02.550 --> 08:05.853
and I just-- Look, this
is just a temporary thing

08:05.919 --> 08:07.655
because these are
conservative people.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.624
Why would you even care

08:10.691 --> 08:12.159
what they possibly
think of us?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.628
We are good people.
You know what I'm s--

08:14.695 --> 08:16.597
Like, now we're
going to walk in like--

08:16.664 --> 08:18.065
feeling like we're liars?

08:18.131 --> 08:20.934
They're fucking--
We are good people.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.836
We're not-- We haven't
done anything wrong.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.774
He's-- He is lucky that he
gets to stay here with us.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.277
Okay, I think you mean

08:30.343 --> 08:31.579
that we're
lucky to have him.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.780
You ask me to put that on--

08:32.846 --> 08:34.682
Colton: Hey, they're here!

08:34.748 --> 08:36.249
Please, please, please,
please, please.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.317
Oh, my God. Just--

08:37.384 --> 08:39.352
Back, back, back, back.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.754
Ho!

08:42.255 --> 08:44.157
- Colton!
- Hey!

08:44.224 --> 08:45.425
Josh: Oh, my God.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.594
Wow.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.695
How are you? Whoa!

08:47.761 --> 08:50.831
There he is.
There's my baby.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.634
Oh, so thin.
You're skin and bones.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.202
My diet's
a little different.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.503
Kind of a sweet tea.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.839
Ah. Hello, there,
young man.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.908
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.943
Hey, these guys, can I
take them to the pool?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.613
Of course. Now don't run,
and behave now.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.114
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your step.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.617
I'm Josh Pfefferman.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.751
This is my fiancÃ©e
Raquel.

09:10.818 --> 09:11.952
Blessing to meet you.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.021
I have imagined
this moment for so long.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.789
You know, Colton has
obsessed his whole life

09:15.856 --> 09:17.024
- about finding who his mom--
- Really?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.391
- Careful of the step.
- Of course.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.927
There's levels
here, Gene.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.495
You're, uh, you're
all grown up, I see.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.797
- Uh--
- In my mind,

09:23.864 --> 09:25.866
I still see that picture
of you as a young boy.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.167
Oh, isn't that
the truth?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.636
Oh, you guys have seen
pictures of me?

09:28.636 --> 09:30.070
Oh, yes. Yes, we have.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.239
Syd:
Full moon ritual tonight.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.707
Okay, the hosts:

09:33.774 --> 09:35.108
Leslie Mackinaw herself

09:35.175 --> 09:38.111
and her so-called
land partner Zelda,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.213
who is also the White
Witch of Echo Park.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.248
Ali: Uh-huh.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.382
Are you listening?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.684
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.086
I am very deep
in this Facebook page.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.254
It is amazing.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.456
I'm listening. Oh, yeah.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.424
Oh, geez.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.493
Okay. I love you.
Put it away.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.928
You're
violating the code,

09:54.995 --> 09:57.464
which is that it is
in the dark only.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.700
Not-- Not for--
Not meant for flossing?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.434
Please. Honestly.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.803
Why have you been
hiding this from me?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.571
Because it's
a nighttime only thing.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.406
That's never seen
the light of day.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.108
It's very uncomfortable.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.777
- I'm never taking it off.
- I'm comfortable--

10:09.843 --> 10:11.111
I'm wearing it
to the full moon ritual.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.913
Look. "Please bring
your own ritual tools."

10:12.980 --> 10:15.649
- Okay, that's--
- "Knives, wands, chalices."

10:15.716 --> 10:16.917
That's not a ritual tool.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.186
Please, will you please
stop touching me?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.587
Uhh!

10:20.654 --> 10:22.389
Well, I would love to go.
We're going.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
- But--
- Yeah?

10:23.523 --> 10:24.624
But what if I say something

10:24.692 --> 10:25.993
or do something stupid

10:26.059 --> 10:27.594
and then she doesn't
let me into her program?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.130
Do you think
she remembers you?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.299
I mean, it's likely.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.334
Okay. So we go.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.036
We, like, sneak around,

10:36.103 --> 10:39.039
I think be all sketchy
in the background,

10:39.106 --> 10:42.743
kind of anonymous, behind
the "womyn": wom-y-en.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.878
If we go, I think
we have to say hi.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.647
Just, like,
twiddle casually.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.049
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.984
Going to do everything
with this now, so--

10:51.051 --> 10:52.652
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm going to do

10:52.720 --> 10:53.787
the New York Times
crossword puzzle

10:53.854 --> 10:55.155
with a dick on. Ooh.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.290
I'm going to make tea
with a dick on--

10:57.357 --> 10:58.525
English breakfast.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.460
I'm going to throw
pebbles in a pond

11:00.527 --> 11:01.862
with a dick on.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.731
Skipping rocks with a dick on?

11:03.731 --> 11:05.198
Yeah, I'd like
to have some feelings

11:05.265 --> 11:07.067
and watch the rain
with a dick on.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.970
[laughter, chatter]

11:14.441 --> 11:16.643
Oh, they're having fun.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.912
I hear you got
coyote out here.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.647
- Mm.
- You allowed to hunt?

11:20.748 --> 11:21.915
Uh, I'm pretty sure

11:21.982 --> 11:24.785
it's hard
to get a firearm in L.A.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.453
Oh, that's not true.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.955
I actually have no idea.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.222
See, that's Gene.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.858
He's a one-track
hunting mind

11:30.924 --> 11:31.892
everywhere we go.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.061
Oh, cool.
Are you a hunter?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.628
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, I am.

11:35.763 --> 11:36.830
- That's nice.
- How about yourself?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.265
- Raquel: Lemonade?
- Hi. Hello.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.266
Josh: Hi.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.101
- Oh, hi.
- Does she know that--

11:41.168 --> 11:43.804
Whose, uh, mobile home
is that out there?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.139
- Josh: Hey. Hi.
- Hello.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.575
Uh, hi.
This is Colton's family.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.810
Maura: Hi.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.945
I'm Pastor Gene.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.413
You must be
Colton's meemaw.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.983
Yes, exactly.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.084
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.685
Pleasure
to meet you, sir.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.487
Hello, I'm Blossie.
I'm Colton's mama.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.789
Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.090
Uh, welcome.
You taken care of?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.325
Gene: Yes.
Everything's wonderful.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.526
Make yourself at home.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.895
We're having snacks.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.064
Did you know where Tammy
kept our family keepsakes?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.665
I'm looking
for the photo albums.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.102
I don't know. She moved
everything, so good luck.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.804
Uh, how long are you
going to be here?

12:16.837 --> 12:19.639
- As long as it takes.
- Okay.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.574
So, uh, everybody good?

12:21.641 --> 12:22.810
- Mm-hmm.
- Just fine.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.911
- Good.
- You going to eat?

12:23.977 --> 12:26.413
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.480
All right.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.631
Hey.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.732
Hi, pretty lady.
How are you?

12:45.833 --> 12:46.967
Fine. Thank you.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.702
- Super moped.
- Oh, thanks.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.105
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry to meet here.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.573
It was, like,
an emergency and--

12:53.640 --> 12:55.008
I gathered as much.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.743
I let the certificate
expire,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.478
and I just really
appreciate it.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.913
Are we at
a business meeting?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.849
- I'm sorry.
- Do you start all drug deals

13:01.882 --> 13:03.416
in parking lots
with a handshake?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.085
Heh heh heh.
Here you go.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.586
Now, this is two joints, okay?

13:06.653 --> 13:07.888
- Mm-hmm.
- You've got to come in

13:07.955 --> 13:09.156
and let me write you
another prescription.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.723
This is very illegal.
I'm just doing this

13:10.858 --> 13:12.192
because you're
Josh's hot sister.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.327
Is this the, um...
I was hoping maybe--

13:14.394 --> 13:16.163
I forgot to ask
if I could have the--

13:16.229 --> 13:18.866
You are acting like
a straight-up junkie
right now.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.767
The indica?
That was the one that I--

13:20.868 --> 13:22.235
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, thank you.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.103
Yeah. Of course.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.437
Oh, my God,
that smells so good.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.738
- Yeah.
- I really appreciate this.

13:25.873 --> 13:26.940
That's going
to do you right.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.009
Just, like, go home,
put on some music--

13:29.076 --> 13:31.444
some, like, Sade,
something like that.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.679
How much do I owe you?

13:32.745 --> 13:33.713
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.215
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.316
It's for Josh. Josh
hooks me up constantly,

13:36.383 --> 13:37.617
so I'm happy to hook
his sister up.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.886
I really appreciate it.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.053
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you so much.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.454
- You can owe me one.
- Yeah.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.657
Hey. Sorry. Uh, you want
to go out sometime?

13:44.724 --> 13:45.893
You want to get
a drink or something?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.460
No. Thank you, though.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.098
Is that 'cause you're gay?

13:52.432 --> 13:53.400
What?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.634
Josh said something

13:54.701 --> 13:56.269
about you being gay now.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.038
Is that why you don't
want to get the drink?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.306
We could just
get it as friends.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.908
You could tell me
about being gay.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.476
I mean, how do you
even know, really,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.078
if you're gay?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.480
I don't know.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.349
When you are in bed at night,

14:09.416 --> 14:12.252
are you thinking about getting
your face in that puss,

14:12.319 --> 14:13.820
or are you thinking
about that sweet-sweet D?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.022
I know for me,

14:15.088 --> 14:16.423
I'm thinking about that puss.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.391
Give me a call

14:18.458 --> 14:20.060
if you need any help
figuring it out.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.528
Okay. Thanks again.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.629
Yeah.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.697
Remember, Sade.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.798
[laughing]

14:25.933 --> 14:27.500
Or some,
like, roots reggae.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.569
[laughing] Got it.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.407
You know, actually,
I'd have to say

14:34.474 --> 14:36.443
that our congregation
is mid-sized.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.046
- Yeah.
- It ebbs and flows

14:39.112 --> 14:40.747
as all things do, but--

14:40.813 --> 14:41.949
- Raquel: Hmm.
- Josh: Huh.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.951
we do get a lot of support

14:43.984 --> 14:45.018
from our weekly
broadcast.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.319
Do you have a program?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.587
TV show.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.956
Yes, indeed I do,

14:48.989 --> 14:51.458
and sometimes I--
I even get recognized.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.493
- Yes, it's true.
- People approach me
at the Sizzler,

14:53.560 --> 14:55.028
- what have you.
- Yes.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.030
Uh, Raquel's a rabbi.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.099
Yes, but I do not
have a TV show.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.802
You know, we love
the Jewish people.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.771
Have the utmost
respect for them.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.974
Good.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.542
Jesus was a Jew.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.543
He was.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.013
We're Jewish.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.348
Oh. All of you are Jewish?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.349
- Yeah.
- Oh.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.550
Colton's Jewish.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.987
Well, some Reform people
would say he's Jewish.

15:19.987 --> 15:20.988
[laughing]

15:21.054 --> 15:22.455
No, he isn't, no.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.556
You're not, sweetie.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.058
- Colton: Uh--
- No, you're not.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.293
Uh, I didn't even--

15:26.359 --> 15:28.028
I haven't even
showed you my room yet.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.562
Your room? Yes.
What a good idea.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.698
- Yeah.
- Yeah, uh, let's do the tour.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.100
I'd love to see
my baby's room.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.002
Go ahead. I'll just
check on the kids.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.303
- Are we going up?
- Okay. Cool.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.005
Are we going
upstairs here?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.572
- Yeah, let's, uh--
- Actually, no.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.308
I'm going to be in this
room when the baby comes.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.875
You want to see
this one first?

15:43.010 --> 15:44.611
The baby? What baby?

15:44.677 --> 15:45.845
Uh, we're--

15:45.912 --> 15:47.080
Josh and Raquel
are having a baby.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.248
Very early on.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.716
That's so much responsibility.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.051
Are you
going to have time

15:51.118 --> 15:52.219
for college
applications?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.453
I mean, because
I'm telling you

15:53.520 --> 15:55.588
the SATs alone
nearly put me under.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.723
[chatter]

15:56.789 --> 15:58.025
Well, Rita's going to help.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.126
Rita will
be a part of this?

15:59.192 --> 16:00.293
It's going to be
a whole village.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.761
You talked to Rita
about this?

16:01.828 --> 16:04.031
You don't have a problem
with Rita, do you?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.267
Uh, no, no.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.870
I just-- She's
a complicated person.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.139
We don't have
a problem, though.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.640
Yeah, she'll be involved.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.709
Well, we all have
complications in our life.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.046
Right now I would like
to see this room downstairs.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.147
Okay. Well,
that's the basement.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.248
We could do that first,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.050
but Colton's room's up here.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.851
- We could do this.
- Congratulations.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.653
You're going
to have a baby.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.888
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.357
We're having a baby.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.360
I hope you don't make
the same mistake as last time.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.363
Um, wh-what are you
talking about?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.266
I'm talking about Colton.
I'm talking about Rita.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.069
Now a new baby.
You left that baby.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.737
You abandoned him.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.077
I didn't--
I didn't abandon Colton.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.644
- Well, sure--
- I--

16:51.711 --> 16:53.246
I didn't
know about Colton

16:53.313 --> 16:54.647
until a few months ago.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.783
Josh, don't lie to me.
I can't believe that.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.652
I'm telling you
I literally had no idea.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.455
I mean, she-- she ran away
and had the baby,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.991
like, I-- She didn't
tell anybody.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.926
I find this
very hard to believe.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.095
What's your deal, man?

17:08.128 --> 17:10.430
Why are you, like,
coming after me?

17:10.497 --> 17:13.466
I'm telling you
I literally had no idea.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.369
Nobody knew.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.271
- I--
- Excuse me.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.609
We knew.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.713
And I want to be
very clear with you.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.782
No one abandoned anyone.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.952
What we did do is make

17:33.019 --> 17:35.955
a sizable contribution
to your church

17:36.022 --> 17:39.726
to help that poor girl
and pay her medical bills.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.643
[door closes]

17:58.278 --> 17:59.979
They fucking knew?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.148
Those--

18:01.181 --> 18:02.249
Do you have any idea

18:02.315 --> 18:03.483
how different
my life would be?

18:03.550 --> 18:05.152
Everything
would be different.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.753
- If what, honey?
- If they hadn't lied.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.255
No, honey,

18:08.321 --> 18:10.323
everything in your life
would have been different

18:10.390 --> 18:12.859
if Rita
hadn't molested you.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.161
Okay.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.263
I'm so sick of everybody
saying that shit.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.564
- Because that is--
- Raquel--

18:17.630 --> 18:19.732
- [knock on door]
- I loved her. Okay?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.734
- Colton: Hey, guys--
- Give us five minutes!

18:21.801 --> 18:24.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do not yell at him.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.306
Hey, hey.
Get in, get in, get in.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.940
Sorry, Colton.
There's-- Uhh.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.176
Get in. Get in here.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.777
I'm sorry. Uh...

18:30.843 --> 18:32.812
I'm really sorry, but
they're packing up the RV,

18:32.879 --> 18:35.882
and they said they can make
space for me if you want.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.186
This is-- This is
fucking insane right now.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.887
Raquel: It is--

18:40.953 --> 18:42.422
Do you--

18:43.423 --> 18:45.292
Do you want to go with them?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.593
Do you want me to go?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.195
I just want
to do what's right.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.362
I want to do
what's best for you.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.232
What-- You're a grown man.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.800
What do you want?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.635
I-- I think you guys got

18:55.702 --> 18:57.970
a really good thing
going on with the baby,

18:58.037 --> 19:00.072
and, Raquel,
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.309
Raquel, uh--

19:02.375 --> 19:05.077
I don't know, man.
I don't-- I don't know.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.647
I-- I-- I'm just--

19:08.881 --> 19:10.583
I'm going to give you
some space, man.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.584
I--

19:12.485 --> 19:13.853
I'm really sorry.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.556
Okay.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.891
[sigh]

19:22.762 --> 19:24.231
What do I do?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.765
What am I
supposed to do?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.802
I-- This-- Uh--

19:29.869 --> 19:32.239
This feels really bad.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.543
I'm--
I'm really stressed out.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.248
I just know that that--

19:42.915 --> 19:44.784
those feelings...

19:44.851 --> 19:47.454
can't be good for a baby.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.206
- [chatter]
- ** [drums]

20:19.419 --> 20:23.256
To those who came before,
wherever they may be.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.025
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.527
- That's her.
- Which one?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.462
She's the one holding court,

20:29.529 --> 20:31.964
the one who you
think she is.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.433
Who is that girl?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.134
Is that her girlfriend
or her daughter?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.403
I don't know.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.271
- She's, like, 16.
- She's--

20:38.338 --> 20:42.108
Hey. Did you go out
with Sailor?

20:42.174 --> 20:44.811
Uh, yeah. Why?

20:44.877 --> 20:45.945
I'm her ex.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.247
Right. Yeah, of course.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.682
No, I-- Yeah.
I recognize you.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.319
God, everybody used
to fuck everybody else,

20:52.385 --> 20:53.720
or else they're
thinking about it,

20:53.786 --> 20:56.122
or it's going to happen
pretty soon.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.424
- What, now?
- That's so true.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.958
Something like that.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.660
I met you at UCLA.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.795
You're Mort Pfefferman's kid.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.731
Maura. But yeah.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.799
Are you going to come
study with me,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.167
the big bad dyke?

21:08.234 --> 21:11.404
Uh, I--
I hope so, yes.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.540
I'm-- I'm Ali.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.342
This is
my girlfriend Syd.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.910
- Hey.
- This is Bella.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.247
Uh, what are you teaching
right now, Leslie?

21:21.348 --> 21:23.650
Uh, well,
I don't really teach.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.587
I like to talk about
things I care about

21:27.654 --> 21:29.356
to people who are ready.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.458
Well, I'm ready.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.630
Shelly: Hon?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.098
Dolly?

21:39.165 --> 21:40.099
Hi.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.968
Oh, good.
I was worried.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.605
[sniffle]

21:48.375 --> 21:49.909
What's the matter?

21:51.378 --> 21:52.945
What's the matter?

21:53.012 --> 21:56.015
Um, Josh knows everything.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.384
He knows about--

21:58.651 --> 21:59.952
He knows about Rita.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.654
He knows
about the money.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.757
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.293
- What did you say?
- Everything.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.562
It just came out.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.566
Are you okay?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.602
[sigh] I feel horrible.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.138
You have nothing
to feel horrible about.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.707
Please.

22:20.773 --> 22:23.242
Please, we were
protecting our boy,

22:23.309 --> 22:24.977
our Joshie.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.479
And-- And look at him now.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.416
He's with a rabbi,
for Christ's sake.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.883
Come on, I'll make you
a cup of coffee.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.952
We'll get a little schnapps.
Maybe a little schnapps.

22:33.019 --> 22:33.986
Come on.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.425
- Hey, hon.
- Yeah.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.431
I'm going to go.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.632
What?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.434
You can't go.
You just got here.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.568
What do you mean?
We have to talk.

22:48.635 --> 22:49.802
You can't go.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.439
This doesn't work,

22:52.505 --> 22:54.441
and you know that.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.443
We're broken.

22:57.444 --> 23:00.447
How dare you do this to me?

23:00.513 --> 23:03.483
Twice in my lifetime,

23:03.550 --> 23:05.151
I have to put up with you

23:05.217 --> 23:07.620
deciding
that I'm not good enough.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.890
It's not about that.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.459
It's not about
you're not good enough.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.461
You have nowhere to go.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.162
I'll be fine. I'm good.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.798
I'm going to pack.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.779
** [drum beat]

23:56.969 --> 24:00.740

is the last moon

24:00.807 --> 24:03.009
in the light of the year
before we cross over.

24:03.075 --> 24:07.680
Then we honor the things
that we have hunted,

24:07.747 --> 24:13.119
the things that we have killed
but have given us life.

24:15.755 --> 24:20.527
That is so violent,
but it's ours.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.131
Force and power
for each of us.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.674
Mm. Safe trip.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.543
You smell so good.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.011
Oh, thank you.
It's shampoo.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.880
Now you have good luck
with that new little one.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.716
It's going to be so much
light into your life.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.084
- Mm.
- So much light.
