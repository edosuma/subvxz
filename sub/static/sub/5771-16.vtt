I DON'T WANT

"RUSH THINGS"?

00:26.194 --> 00:27.628
WE'VE BEEN KISSING
FOR, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.297
THAT'S LIKE A WEEK
IN GUY MINUTES.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.065
COME ON, DON'T I GET CREDIT
FOR THAT?

WE'VE GONE ON AT LEAST
FIVE DATES,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.336

LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF GIRLS

00:51.419 --> 00:53.621
IN NEW YORK CITY THAT WOULD KILL

00:53.654 --> 00:56.157
OKAY, THAT SEEMS UNTRUE.
IT IS TRUE.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.287
MY RATES HAVE GONE UP.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.289
THAT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.164
GOOD MORNING, COLLEAGUES.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.932
DANNY, I BROUGHT YOUR
FAVORITE BREAKFAST--OATMEAL,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.501
WITH A SIDE OF BROWN SUGAR.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.837
AND BY "BROWN SUGAR,"
I, OF COURSE, MEAN MY BUTT.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.340
PETER?
WHERE'S DANNY?

02:19.373 --> 02:20.674
OH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

02:20.708 --> 02:21.942
HE CAME INTO HIS OFFICE
THIS MORNING,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.344
AND HE WAS ALL SWEATY
AND CRANKY.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.678

02:28.482 --> 02:29.950
WHO ALL USED
THE SAME EXCUSE,

02:29.983 --> 02:31.485
WHICH WAS, "I'M GOING BACK
TO GRADUATE SCHOOL,"

02:31.519 --> 02:33.321
WHICH IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME SAYING,

02:33.354 --> 02:34.955
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT PRECLUDES
YOU FROM DATING SOMEONE.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.624
ANYWAY, HE PASSED OUT.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.226
AND I WAS LIKE,
"DANNY, RUDE.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.293
I'M TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY WEEKEND."

02:39.327 --> 02:40.761
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.406
MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.641

I EVEN BROUGHT HIM
MR. NECK.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.689
SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.857
I DON'T KNOW

I WOULD READ IT TO YOU.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.952
THAT'S GREAT.
NO, I'M--I'M GOOD.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.854

TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER GUY.

(Peter)
WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

PLEASE PROMISE ME THAT YOU
HAVE NOT GRATIFIED YOURSELF

05:17.685 --> 05:19.119
WHILE YOU
WERE WATCHING THIS.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.389
OH, MY GOD!
NO, I DIDN'T.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.856
PETER, CAN YOU PLEASE
BE MORE CONVINCING THAN THAT?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.925
JUST DON'T LOOK UP
GUILTILY!

05:24.958 --> 05:26.560
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.628
I DIDN'T?

OH, GOD.

05:28.962 --> 05:29.997
OH, GOD.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.632
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS BAD

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
FOR THE WHOLE PRACTICE.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.469
BUT I GOT TO SAY,

05:35.503 --> 05:36.937
I'VE NEVER MET
A REAL PORNOGRAPHY ACTOR

05:36.970 --> 05:38.105
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.540
I'M KIND OF GEEKING OUT.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.841
I CAN'T--
I NEED TO LIE ON THE FLOOR.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.810
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.812
YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS
WITH THAT TRUMPET MUSIC?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.715
THAT WAS JUST MY NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOR PRACTICING HIS TRUMPET.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.017
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF BEAUTIFUL
IF YOU LISTEN TO IT.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.819
THERE IS A VERY SPIRITED DEBATE
ABOUT THAT

05:51.852 --> 05:53.721
IN THE COMMENT SECTION.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.689
THE COMMENT SECTION?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.725
WELL, YEAH,
IT'S A VIDEO ONLINE.

I TOLD YOU
I WAS GEEKING OUT.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.567
I GAVE IT THREE STARS.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.168
MY LIFE IS OVER.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.003
MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE IS OVER,
AND MY PERSONAL LIFE IS OVER.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.772
THIS IS HORRIFYING, PETER!

06:11.805 --> 06:14.708
AND THE WORST PART IS
I JUST STARTED...

06:14.742 --> 06:16.644
HANGING OUT WITH THIS GUY,

06:16.677 --> 06:19.613
A REALLY SPECIAL GUY
THAT I'VE LIKED FOR A LONG TIME.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.449
WELL, THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

06:21.482 --> 06:24.585
NO, IF HE SEES THIS,
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE OVER.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.053
THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN TELLING HIM

06:26.086 --> 06:27.588
I WANT TO, LIKE,
"TAKE IT SLOW."

06:27.621 --> 06:30.724
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU.
I KNOW!

06:33.026 --> 06:34.895
I TELL YOU WHAT--
I CAN HELP.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.863
REALLY?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.531
IN ORDER TO SQUASH THIS,

06:37.565 --> 06:38.866
WE NEED TO GO RIGHT
TO THE SOURCE.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.101

07:00.988 --> 07:02.823
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT AN URGENT MATTER.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.124
LOOK, MINDY,
WE'RE NOT DATING ANYMORE.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.559
SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU
FREE TOOTHBRUSHES.

I ALREADY GOT
MY FREE TOOTHBRUSHES.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.128
SO JOKE'S ON YOU.

FASTER!
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.567
LET'S GO.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.503
HEY, WHY IS OUR SEX TAPE
ON THE INTERNET?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.137
I-I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.172
I SWEAR ON
MY MOTHER'S GRAVE,

07:19.206 --> 07:21.575
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

07:21.609 --> 07:22.910
NO, WAIT.
I...

07:22.943 --> 07:24.244
I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.979
OH, MY GOSH.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.981
I LENT IT TO MY BROTHER
WHEN HE GOT DIVORCED.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.718
WHAT?
IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE,
IT REALLY HELPED.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.752
HE HAD A BAD CASE
OF THE BLUES.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.554
[clears throat]
I AM VERY SORRY.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.688
THIS IS PETER, MY COLLEAGUE.
THIS IS TOM.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.689
TOM, PETER.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.090
SUPER DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, MAN.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.526
YES.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.627
I AM ALSO PRETTY PSYCHED
TO MEET YOU.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.828
YOU'RE MY NEW FAVORITE
MALE PORN STAR.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.995
[whispering]
SHUT UP.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.832
LOOK, I JUST STARTED DATING
MY DENTAL ASSISTANT, OKAY?

07:44.865 --> 07:47.267
I DON'T NEED THIS. WE'RE COMING
UP ON OUR TWO-MONTH ANNIVERSARY,

07:47.300 --> 07:48.636
SO STOP IT WITH THE PORN--

07:48.669 --> 07:50.504
HEY...
WE'RE OUT OF GAUZE.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.772
SHOULD I ORDER GAUZE?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.975
YEAH, ANGEL,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, OKAY?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.810
BOOP.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.815
[sighs]

08:01.849 --> 08:03.216
I MEAN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET ANYTHING DONE

08:03.250 --> 08:04.685
WITH THAT IN MY FACE
ALL DAY?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.019
OKAY.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.555
LOOK, OKAY,

08:07.588 --> 08:08.922
I'LL DESTROY THAT TAPE
THE MINUTE I GET HOME, OKAY?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.591
THANK YOU.
NO WAY, BUDDY.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.959
YOU GOTTA BRING
THAT TAPE TO MINDY.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.861
NO MAN IN HISTORY
HAS EVER DESTROYED A SEX TAPE.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.996
UH-HUH.
THANK YOU, MY SLIMY FRIEND.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.866
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
YOU ARE NOT DESTROYING IT.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.701
YOU'RE GONNA BRING IT
TO MY OFFICE,

08:20.734 --> 08:22.903
PLACE IT ON MY DESK, AND YOU'RE
GONNA CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND YOU,

08:22.936 --> 08:25.606
TODAY.
I'LL DO IT TODAY.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.274
AND WHAT IF
MARGO FOUND OUT?

08:27.307 --> 08:30.778
I SHOT THAT BEFORE
SHE TURNED ME SUPER CHRISTIAN.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.146
HEY, WHO'S UNCOMFORTABLE?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.648
OKAY,
THIS IS GREAT.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.849
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.085
I'LL JUST DESTROY THAT TAPE
BEFORE ANYONE IMPORTANT SEES IT.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.053
MINDY,
IT'S ON THE INTERNET.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.255
WE HAVE TO GO TO SPLODERS.COM
AND GET THEM TO TAKE IT DOWN.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.123
NO, NO, NO.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.758
I'M NOT GONNA GO
TO SOME SEEDY WAREHOUSE

08:44.792 --> 08:46.193
WHERE THEY
MAKE PORNS, OKAY?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.360
AND HAVE TO DEAL
WITH SOME GROSS SLIME-OS.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.830
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT!
YOU'RE BEING
PRETTY CLOSE-MINDED

08:49.863 --> 08:51.799
FOR A GIRL WHO JUST GOT
HER START IN PORN.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.300
OKAY.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.636
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
A LITTLE ADVICE...

08:55.669 --> 08:57.337
IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.606
OH, OKAY.

08:58.639 --> 09:02.776
MY COLLEAGUE MINDY AND I--
WE, UH...

09:02.810 --> 09:05.245
WE'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW...

09:05.278 --> 09:06.814
KISSING.
OH!

09:06.847 --> 09:08.081
BUT JUST KISSING.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.817
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH ME YET.
OH.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.051
I MEAN, SHE'S NO PRUDE.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.654
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN HER NUMBER
ON TWO DIFFERENT BATHROOM WALLS

09:13.687 --> 09:15.756
IN HER OWN HANDWRITING.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.692
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, RICHIE...

09:18.726 --> 09:20.093
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.329
COME ON.
OF COURSE SHE LIKES YOU.

09:22.362 --> 09:27.034
MAYBE SHE JUST WANTS TO TAKE IT
A LITTLE SLOW BECAUSE...

09:27.067 --> 09:28.602
SHE KNOWS HOW JUDGMENTAL
YOU CAN BE.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.637
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M NOT JUDGMENTAL.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.038
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.840
HEY, DID I TELL YOU THAT
I'M THINKING OF LEASING A CAR

09:32.873 --> 09:34.307
INSTEAD OF BUYING?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.644
OH, YEAH, THAT'S GREAT, RICHIE.
THAT'S REAL GREAT.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.712
HAVE FUN NOT BUILDING UP
A CREDIT HISTORY.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.780
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.749
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEXT TIME
I BUY YOU A SUZE ORMAN BOOK,

09:41.782 --> 09:43.651
I'M GONNA THROW IT
IN THE TRASH MYSE--

09:43.684 --> 09:44.752
OKAY, I GET IT.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.153
YOU'RE TESTING ME.
YOU'RE TESTING ME.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.288
DANNY, IF MINDY WANTS
TO TAKE THINGS SLOW,

09:48.321 --> 09:50.023
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT...

09:50.057 --> 09:52.626
JUST LIKE YOU'RE GONNA WANT HER
TO ACCEPT, ONE DAY,

09:52.660 --> 09:54.995
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE TURNING ON
THE HEAT IN THE WINTER.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.030
WHY, TO HEAT UP A DRAWER
FULL OF UNUSED SWEATERS?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.632
YOU WANT TO GET WARM,

09:58.666 --> 10:01.735
GET ON THE FLOOR
AND DO SOME PUSH-UPS, OKAY?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.203
OKAY, LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

10:05.372 --> 10:09.076
(woman on radio)
* 92.5

10:09.109 --> 10:10.243
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.979
SPRING IS OUR HORNY SEASON.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.413
OF COURSE.
BY THE WAY...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.783
I'M A BIG FAN
OF YOUR WORK.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.185
OH, GOD, KILL ME.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.221
SO WE UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD
LIKE US TO TAKE DOWN YOUR VIDEO,

10:21.254 --> 10:22.890
AND WE HEAR YOU.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.725
INTEGRITY IS THE HALLMARK
OF SPLODERS

10:24.758 --> 10:26.694
AND THE SPLODERS FAMILY
OF PORN WEBSITES.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.762
OH, COOL.
SO YOU'LL DO IT.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.731
SPLODERS
IS A FAMILY BUSINESS.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.901
IN 1922, OUR GRANDFATHER
IRWIN FLEISCHMAN

10:33.934 --> 10:35.736
ARRIVED AT ELLIS ISLAND,

10:35.769 --> 10:37.370
TOOK ONE LOOK
AT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

10:37.404 --> 10:40.708
AND THOUGHT, "I WONDER WHAT
SHE'S GOT GOING ON UNDER THERE."

10:40.741 --> 10:43.310
AND SPLODERS WAS BORN.
WOW.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.446
GRANDPA BELIEVED YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO GO TO THE MUSEUM

10:46.479 --> 10:47.981
TO SEE A NAKED WOMAN.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.118
MISS YOU, POP-POP!
HORNY FREAK.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.855
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE CAN'T OBLIGE YOUR REQUEST.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.724
YOU SEE, AS IT TURNS OUT,
THERE IS A GROWING MARKET

10:56.757 --> 10:58.325
FOR INDIAN BBWs.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.727
WAIT.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.994
WHAT'S A BBW?

11:01.028 --> 11:02.896
OH, YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THAT FOR HER.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.765
OH, I HAVE TO GUESS IT.

11:04.798 --> 11:08.335
OKAY. UM, IS IT, LIKE,
"BRAINY BIRDLIKE WIFE" MATERIAL?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.770
NO, IT MEANS
"BIG BEAUTIFUL WOMAN."

11:09.803 --> 11:12.005
WHAT...THE HELL?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.007
"BEAUTIFUL WOMAN" IS IN THERE.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.109
BUT ALSO "BIG."
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.712
LOOK AT THESE WRISTS.
LOOK AT HOW DAINTY THEY ARE!

11:18.746 --> 11:21.414
THEY CAN BARELY HOLD UP THE
ENORMOUS CALZONES THAT I EAT.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.717
THE PROBLEM IS HERE, GUYS,

11:23.751 --> 11:26.153
THAT THERE AREN'T VERY MANY
INDIAN WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY

11:26.186 --> 11:27.454
THAT HAVE
THE KIND OF LOOSE MORALS

11:27.487 --> 11:30.057
THAT ALLOW THEM
TO STAR IN THESE VIDEOS.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.424
MOST OF THEM BECOME DOCTORS.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.492
WELL, I AM A DOCTOR!

11:32.525 --> 11:33.493
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.928
WE'RE BOTH GYNECOLOGISTS.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.497
WE'RE ALL GYNECOLOGISTS
IN THIS ROOM.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.968
LOOK, FROM ONE PORN AFICIONADO
TO A COUPLE OTHERS,

11:41.001 --> 11:44.838
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
DO US A SOLID.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.774
WISH WE COULD.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.175
BUT IF WE TOOK DOWN A VIDEO

11:48.208 --> 11:49.442
EVERY TIME SOMEONE
DIDN'T LIKE IT,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.444
WE WOULDN'T BE RICH
BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.180
DID I MENTION MY HOUSE
HAS FOUR POOLS?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.762
THIS IS JUST TYPICAL ME,
YOU KNOW?

12:08.796 --> 12:10.397
I SCREWED SOMETHING UP
BEFORE I EVEN GOT A CHANCE

12:10.430 --> 12:12.132
TO SCREW IT UP.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.104
HEY, GUYS? I NEED TO TELL YOU
A STORY REAL QUICK.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.371
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

12:18.405 --> 12:20.373
I COULD'VE TAKEN PICTURES
OF EVERY HOT TRI DELT

12:20.407 --> 12:21.942
AT THE DARTMOUTH
NUDE OLYMPICS.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.043
DID I?
YOU BET I DID.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.344
DID I PUT 'EM ONLINE?

12:24.377 --> 12:26.046
TRIED,
COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.148
TRIED AGAIN,
STILL HAVING TROUBLE.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.316
TRIED A THIRD TIME,

12:29.349 --> 12:31.084
STILL WAS HAVING PROBLEMS.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.085
I BOUGHT A FIREWIRE CABLE--

12:32.119 --> 12:33.520
I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.188
KIND OF A LONG STORY.
YEP.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.223
YOU WENT TO DARTMOUTH?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.125
YEAH, I'M A D-BAG.
ARE YOU A D-BAG?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.193
CLASS OF '96,
CLASS OF '98.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.394
(Peter)
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.296
FOR THE BIG GREEN?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.398
OKAY, BUT ONLY
FOR BIG GREEN.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.300
(all)
WAH-HOO-WAH!

12:47.334 --> 12:48.401
WAHOO-WAH!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.203
THAT'S NOT
HOW WE DID THAT.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.239
MS. LAHIRI,
BEFORE YOU GO...

12:52.272 --> 12:54.141
WOULD YOU CONSIDER STARRING
IN A NEW PROJECT FOR US?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.909
WE'LL PAY YOU $300,000.

12:55.943 --> 12:59.412
I'M SORRY, THREE HUNDO-THUNDO
JUST TO FLASH VINCE AND OWEN?

12:59.446 --> 13:02.182
GUY, SHE JUST BEGGED YOU
TO TAKE DOWN HER SEX TAPE.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.918
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'D STOOP THAT LOW TO...

13:04.952 --> 13:06.486
MINDY?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.554
OF COURSE NOT.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.090
IT JUST--IT SEEMS LIKE
SUCH EASY MONEY.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.425
DR. C. HEY!
YEAH.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.027
DON'T REST SO MUCH.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

13:14.061 --> 13:14.928
YOU GOT TO WAKE UP.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.964
MORGAN, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.866
I HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
FOR MY BEST GUY FRIEND.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.234
THAT'S NICE.
[groans]

13:21.268 --> 13:22.469
WHAT ABOUT THE BALLOONS?

13:22.502 --> 13:24.604
THESE ARE FOR MY OWN
PERSONAL USE.
OKAY.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.106
BUT DR. L'S ACTUALLY
GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT HERE,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.108
AND SHE ASKED ME TO DROP OFF
SOME OF HER WORK.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
VERY SWEET...
MM-HMM.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.278
AND PROFESSIONAL.
YEAH.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.046
SO, UH...

13:33.080 --> 13:34.848
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
BRING ME ANYTHING?

13:34.882 --> 13:37.384
I COULD SING YOU A SONG
SO YOU FEEL BETTER.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.585
NO.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.253
CAN YOU SING ME A SONG
SO I FEEL BETTER?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.454
GOOD-BYE, MORGAN.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.056
[sighs]

13:43.090 --> 13:45.025
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE ME.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.559
YOU COULD DIE.
NOT GONNA DIE.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.362
YOU MIGHT.
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.098
YOU'RE ONE IN A MILLION,
CASTELLANO.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.467
[door opens, closes]

14:02.943 --> 14:04.044
[sighs]

14:04.077 --> 14:05.045
(Peter)
WHAT FLOOR IS DANNY ON?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.579
FIVE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, PETER?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.148
AFTER DEFEATING
THAT PORN EMPIRE,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.950
I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE THE STAIRS.
TAKE THE STAIRS?

14:09.983 --> 14:13.220
MINDY, THEY HAD TO AIRLIFT YOU
OUT OF A 5K FUN RUN FOR CANCER.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.122
WE'RE TAKING THE ELEVATOR.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.061
WHERE DO YOU PUT
THE TAPE IN?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.930
[elevator bell dings]

14:22.963 --> 14:24.898
OKAY, UM, I'M MAD
THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

14:24.932 --> 14:25.899
YOU KNOW THAT'S
A SENSITIVE SUBJECT WITH ME.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.468
I FEEL LIKE I CAN GET AIRLIFTED
ONCE IN A WHILE.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.536
EJECT...
THAT WORKS.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.904
YEAH.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.072
[elevator bell dings]

14:32.105 --> 14:34.341
JILLIAN MICHAELS SAYS THAT
THESE ARE WASTED OPPORTUNITIES.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.076
JILLIAN WHO?

14:37.444 --> 14:38.878
BINGO.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.951
[elevator bell dings]

14:43.984 --> 14:45.685
OKAY, YOU WIN.
LET'S TAKE THE STAIRS.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.120
[knock at door]

14:47.154 --> 14:49.556
(Tom)
MINDY.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.959
(Mindy)
WHO'S MINDY?
I'M CODY, MISTER.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.227
I'M SELLING COOKIES,
COOKIES TO TURN YOU ON.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.695
YOU'RE DIRTY.
IT'S HAPPENING.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.629
[both moaning]

14:56.663 --> 14:59.066
NO! NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO THAT.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.134
DON'T DO THAT!
DON'T DO THAT TO HIM!

15:01.168 --> 15:02.335
OH, MY...

15:02.369 --> 15:05.172
YOU KNOW, MY SOPHOMORE YEAR,
MENINGITIS TORE THROUGH MY FRAT.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.239
MM-HMM.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.141
WE THOUGHT WE WERE HUNGOVER
FOR THE FIRST WEEK.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.177
IF QUEEF'S DAD HADN'T BEEN
THE SURGEON GENERAL,

15:10.210 --> 15:11.178
WE ALL WOULD'VE BEEN
NIPS UP.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.980
NO KIDDING.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.147
WAIT.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.116
[distant sensual
trumpet music plays]

15:16.149 --> 15:18.085
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.586
AHHHH!

15:19.619 --> 15:21.088
OH, MY GOD.
(Tom)
YOU ARE DIRTY!

15:21.121 --> 15:22.956
[yells]

15:22.990 --> 15:24.424
AH, GOD!
I CAN'T UNSEE THIS.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.426
MINDY, I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE. HEY!

15:26.459 --> 15:29.162
THAT'S BURNED IN MY RETINA!
AH!

15:29.196 --> 15:31.098
OH, TOM, YOU OWN ME.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.433
GET AWAY FROM HER
WITH THAT THING! OH!

15:33.466 --> 15:35.202
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.070
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THIS
TO ME, YOU SICKO?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.072
DANNY, I GAVE IT TO TOM,
LIKE, TEN YEARS AGO.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.173
IT MEANS NOTHING.
OH, YEAH?

15:40.207 --> 15:42.109
WERE YOU TAKING IT SLOW
WHEN YOU MADE THIS WITH TOM?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.111
OR IS THIS MEDIUM SPEED
FOR YOU?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.145
NO, THAT'S FASTER
THAN MEDIUM SPEED.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.146
DO NOT LOOK AT THAT!

15:46.179 --> 15:48.548
IT WAS THE 2000s, OKAY?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.750
YOU WERE KIND OF A LOSER
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SEX TAPE.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.185
IT'S DISGUSTING.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.720
GOD! WHY DID I EVEN
HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.388
MY EYES HURT.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

15:58.658 --> 15:59.492
WHAT?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.194
(Peter)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.062
WHY DO YOU CARE
SO MUCH, DANNY?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.297
I'M JUST...

16:04.331 --> 16:06.199
WORRIED THAT THIS TAPE
ISN'T GOOD FOR THE PRACTICE.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.367
THE PRACTICE?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.469
I'VE DONE WAY WORSE THINGS
TO THE PRACTICE.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.038
LAST WEEK I CALLED IN
A BOMB THREAT

16:11.071 --> 16:12.239
'CAUSE I WAS TOO HUNGOVER
TO COME IN.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.574
THAT'S SO MUCH WORSE, DANNY,
ISN'T IT?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.243
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.310
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE TAPE, OKAY?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.079
I DON'T--
I FEEL LIKE
I'M MISSING SOMETHING,

16:19.112 --> 16:21.281
'CAUSE THE ONLY PERSON
THAT SHOULD BE, LIKE, THAT UPSET

16:21.314 --> 16:23.016
IS THE NEW GUY
MINDY'S DATING.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.053
WAIT.
WAIT.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.087
WAIT.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.055
WHAT?
WAIT.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.089
WHAT?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.223
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.791
PLEASE STOP REPEATING
THE WORD "WAIT"!

16:31.824 --> 16:34.027
MINDY, ARE YOU
AND DANNY PORKING?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.129
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
US TWO?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.498
WE ARE NEVER GONNA DO THAT.
RIDICULOUS.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.233
THAT IS UNPROFESSIONAL.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.501
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX,
RIGHT, MINDY?

16:41.534 --> 16:42.669
MM-HMM.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.071
ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT, MIN?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.472
YOU'RE ALL, LIKE, NAUSEOUS
AND FEVERY.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.474
YOU LOOK LIKE THAT MORNING
YOU TRIED TO BE A VEGAN.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.142
YEAH, YOU'RE SWEATING.
IS IT GUILT? IS IT GUILT SWEATS?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.711
OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAVE DANNY'S MENINGITIS!

16:51.744 --> 16:53.146
WHAT?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.581
IF SHE HAS MENINGITIS,
IT'S HER OWN STRAIN.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.149
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.284
YOU TWO ARE PORKING!

16:57.317 --> 16:58.651
WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE COWORKERS.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.153
WE'RE NOT.
YEAH, WE'RE COWORKERS.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.721
AND THE REASON I'M SWEATY
IS THAT...

17:01.754 --> 17:03.090
I DID CROSSFIT EARLIER.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.525
SO I'M STILL KIND OF FEELING
THE...EFFECTS.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.660
WHOA!
MINDY?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.496
HER SHIRT'S UP.
OKAY, DON'T LOOK!

17:09.529 --> 17:10.497
SORRY.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.531
NURSE!

17:14.101 --> 17:15.535
HEY, KIDDO.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.538
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE SAD.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.173
WANT ME TO CHEER YOU UP?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.442
DO SOME SHELDON
FROM BIG BANG THEORY?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.577
[imitating Sheldon]
BAZINGA! HMM?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.346
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A WOMAN BEFORE.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.348
OH, PETER,
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR SHELDON,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.183
BUT I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
TO LAUGH.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.485
YOU KNOW, UH,

17:32.519 --> 17:34.621
IF THIS NEW GUY
YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH

17:34.654 --> 17:36.523
IS GONNA LOSE
HIS SHITAKE MUSHROOM

17:36.556 --> 17:37.657
OVER A SEX TAPE,

17:37.690 --> 17:39.559
THEN HE'S PROBABLY NOT
THE RIGHT GUY FOR YOU ANYWAY.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.329
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS...

17:42.362 --> 17:45.198
IT SEEMS LIKE
THERE IS NO GUY ANYMORE,

17:45.232 --> 17:46.866
AND I'M JUST GONNA BE
ALL ALONE--

17:46.899 --> 17:48.601
JUST SOME OVERSEXED CREEP

17:48.635 --> 17:50.537
WHO CAN'T EVEN MAKE
A GOOD SEX TAPE.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.539
HEY. THAT TAPE HAD A LOT
GOING AGAINST IT--

17:52.572 --> 17:55.808
I MEAN, BAD LIGHTING,
FEMALE DIRECTOR.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.477
THE WORST PART IS...

17:57.510 --> 17:59.212
I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE TOM
THAT MUCH,

17:59.246 --> 18:01.614
NOT NEARLY AS MUCH
AS I LIKE THIS NEW GUY.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.616
AND THAT'S RUINED.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.488
WELL, I GOTTA GO.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.324
I'M A TOTAL GERMAPHOBE.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.493
[knock at door]

18:13.526 --> 18:16.363
HEY, DANNY.
MOVE IT.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.797
OH, GOD, KILL ME.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.332
(Peter)
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT MINDY

18:19.366 --> 18:20.367
EMBARRASSED THE PRACTICE,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.769
BUT BEFORE YOU GET
ALL JUDGE-Y REINHOLD ON HER,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.504
LISTEN TO WHAT TOM
HAS TO SAY.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.838
OKAY, MARGO'S OUT
IN THE HALLWAY,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.508
SO LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THE SEX TAPE.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.877
YOU KNOW, SHE THINKS
I'M A VIRGIN.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:30.910 --> 18:32.845
HEY, HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
TRYING TO PULL THE PLUG.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.447
STOP IT!
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.815
TOM, TELL HIM
ABOUT THE TIME

18:35.848 --> 18:37.484
THAT YOU SPENT TOGETHER
WITH MINDY.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.586
WHY DOES HE NEED TO KNOW THAT?
WHY IS THAT A DEAL?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.321
MARGO, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME IN HERE

18:41.354 --> 18:42.455
AND WATCH A MOVIE?
THAT'S NOT NICE.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.424
YOU'RE NOT BEING NICE.
NO. HEY, BACK!

18:44.457 --> 18:47.394
BACK, HONEY!
NOT NICE.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.795
THAT'S NOT NICE? YOU JUST
SLAMMED THE DOOR IN HER FACE.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.198
DANNY, LISTEN,
I DON'T THINK MINDY

18:51.231 --> 18:53.433
EVER REALLY LIKED ME
THAT MUCH, OKAY?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.436
I THINK WE DID ALL
THE FREAKY SEX STUFF BECAUSE...

18:56.469 --> 18:58.505
WE DIDN'T LIKE SPENDING TIME
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.508
AND WHEN I SAY "FREAKY,"
I MEAN LIKE REALLY FREAKY.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.510
[whispering]
DID YOU EVER TAPE ANY OF THAT?

19:03.543 --> 19:04.477
MOST OF IT.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.678
WHAT?
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.280
I'M JUST SAYING,
I THINK SHE WOULD'VE DUMPED ME

19:07.314 --> 19:08.581
AFTER TWO WEEKS
IF I DIDN'T HAVE SUCH A HUGE--

19:08.615 --> 19:09.782
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.618
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
YOU BRING THAT UP.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.685
THANK YOU.
WE GOOD?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.221
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH. WE'RE GOOD.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.922
I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS...

19:15.955 --> 19:18.591
OKAY, MAYBE THAT DIDN'T GO
AS WELL AS I THOUGHT.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.593
BUT MINDY
DIDN'T EVEN LIKE TOM.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.594
AND IF YOU COULD'VE SEEN

19:21.628 --> 19:22.962
THE CRAZY LENGTHS
SHE WENT THROUGH

19:22.995 --> 19:25.765
TO MAKE SURE YOUR EYES
DIDN'T GET ON THAT TAPE...

19:25.798 --> 19:29.202
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
MINDY REALLY...

19:29.236 --> 19:32.739
RESPECTS THE PRACTICE.

19:32.772 --> 19:36.909
MAYBE SHE'S EVEN A LITTLE BIT
IN LOVE WITH THE PRACTICE.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.579
MAYBE SHE EVEN WANTS
TO GET BONED BY THE PRACTICE.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.647
OKAY, THANK YOU, PETER.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.582
YEAH.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.552
(woman on TV)
VERONICA, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
TO MY OTHER TALK SHOW?

19:45.585 --> 19:46.853
(Veronica)
BECAUSE MY CAT IS SICK.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.688
AND JESSICA SAID
YOU DIDN'T CARE!

19:48.721 --> 19:51.524
[knock at door]

19:51.558 --> 19:52.959
HEY.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.927
OH, HEY.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.531
I JUST CAME DOWN TO BORROW
YOUR BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.433
I THINK
I MUST'VE LOST MINE.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.569
UH, IT'S OVER THERE.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.472
THE NURSE PUT IT ACROSS THE ROOM
AS PUNISHMENT FOR PINCHING HER.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.374
SO...

20:07.407 --> 20:09.876
ENJOY IT.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.546
YOU KNOW...

20:13.580 --> 20:16.483
I WAS THINKING THAT, UH...

20:18.518 --> 20:21.454
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.591
I THINK...

20:24.624 --> 20:26.959
I THINK I LIKE THAT YOU WANT
TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.631
LET'S DO SLOW.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.770
[sighs]

20:37.804 --> 20:39.472
CHAPTER ONE.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.409
CAN YOU DO THE VOICES?

20:42.442 --> 20:45.011
[sighs]
OKAY.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.581
[British accent]
"THE LAST THING ON EARTH
I FEEL PHYSICALLY,

20:48.615 --> 20:51.618

20:57.757 --> 20:59.792
OH! THAT'S WHERE
SHE MEETS DARCY.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.528
[normal voice]
OH, YEAH? WHO'S SHE?

21:01.561 --> 21:03.696
NO, MARK DARCY--
COLIN FIRTH.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.765
OH. OKAY.
YEP.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.401
I LIKE THAT GUY.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.002
[British accent]
"'OH, HELLO, DARLING.

"'NO!' I BELLOWED.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.593
(man)
GO TO BED.
