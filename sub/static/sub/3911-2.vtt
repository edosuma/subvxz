Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:26.680 --> 00:27.850
It's over.

00:28.660 --> 00:31.670
Tomorrow morning
they're carrying out your sentence.

00:33.770 --> 00:35.770
[hatch clattering]

00:35.770 --> 00:37.340
[gasping]

00:37.340 --> 00:38.300
All we know here

00:38.300 --> 00:40.840
is blood and
violence and revenge.

00:40.870 --> 00:41.990
It's what we do.

00:41.990 --> 00:43.620
This life we have,

00:43.850 --> 00:46.140
it didn't cost you
anything.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.720
But I paid for it.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.500
Everything.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.380
My name's Sammy,
by the way.

00:52.610 --> 00:53.810
Abdul.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.170
And I thought maybe
we could hang out.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.420
I'd be disappointed
if we didn't.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.920
Do your parents know?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.370
Know what?

01:07.370 --> 01:09.760
[people chatting in background]

01:09.760 --> 01:11.620
Hey! You!

01:11.720 --> 01:12.940
Stop!
[loud explosion, shattering]

01:12.940 --> 01:14.940
[loud explosion, shattering]

01:17.690 --> 01:19.560
You are not dead, Bassam.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.100
[coughing]

01:21.100 --> 01:24.100
Arif switched you with
another enemy of the State

01:24.100 --> 01:26.350
who had an appointment
with the gallows.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.650
- [Bassam scoffs]
- This land you betrayed me for,

01:29.800 --> 01:30.980
your own brother,

01:30.980 --> 01:33.890
I give it to you. All of it.

01:52.190 --> 01:54.190
[pen scraping]

01:59.790 --> 02:02.190
[cigar sizzles]

02:08.789 --> 02:12.190
[grunting, moaning]

02:15.190 --> 02:19.190
[moaning continues]

02:25.190 --> 02:27.190
[Jamal exhales deeply]

02:30.520 --> 02:31.760
You all right?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.760
[crickets chirp in background]

02:38.820 --> 02:40.820
[glass clinks]

02:40.820 --> 02:42.730
Jamal, stop this.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.680
You had no choice.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.580
[clicks tongue]

02:49.410 --> 02:53.110
I... don't know
if you ever liked him,

02:53.110 --> 02:56.280
but I did love him.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.420
Even after
he left that first time,

03:02.460 --> 03:04.030
when I should have realized

03:04.030 --> 03:05.640
that what I felt for him,

03:05.640 --> 03:07.640
he didn't feel for me.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.440
[sighs sharply]

03:13.980 --> 03:15.130
You're wrong.

03:18.530 --> 03:20.090
I loved him, too.

03:24.450 --> 03:26.320
Because
he was your brother.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.470
I'm sorry
he let you down.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.880
I'm sorry
he let us down.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.230
But I'm glad
this is behind us.

03:47.030 --> 03:51.030
[wind blows and gusts]

03:59.030 --> 04:03.030

04:04.030 --> 04:07.030

04:08.530 --> 04:10.630

04:12.630 --> 04:14.630

04:14.630 --> 04:16.630

04:16.630 --> 04:18.630

04:18.630 --> 04:20.630

04:20.630 --> 04:22.630
[bubbling sound]

04:22.630 --> 04:25.040
[blows out air]

04:25.040 --> 04:26.390
What are you doing?

04:26.390 --> 04:28.390
[bubbling]

04:30.390 --> 04:32.390
[sniffs]

04:35.710 --> 04:37.520
That shit stinks.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.040
[sets lighter on table]

04:39.040 --> 04:41.110
And it's not good
for the baby.

04:41.230 --> 04:42.540
Relax.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.170
It's just the
Minister of Energy Development

04:46.170 --> 04:48.330
fortifying himself
for the work week.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.330
[horn blaring]

04:53.230 --> 04:55.050
...then at 3:00,
there's a presentation

04:55.050 --> 04:56.980
from the
Safety Cap Corporation

04:56.980 --> 04:58.340
in anticipation of their bid

04:58.340 --> 05:00.970
to provide Blow Out Prevention
Equipment for all the new wells.

05:01.980 --> 05:02.990
I'm sorry.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.380
What is Blow Out
Prevention Equipment?

05:05.470 --> 05:06.550
Well...

05:07.190 --> 05:08.910
do you know what
a blow out is?

05:11.460 --> 05:13.140
I'll E-mail you some literature.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.550
Yes, Chao?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.610
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Al Fayeed,

05:18.610 --> 05:19.980
but I was reviewing
your layout

05:19.980 --> 05:21.850
for tomorrow's
groundbreaking ceremony

05:21.860 --> 05:22.960
and was wondering
if I could

05:22.960 --> 05:24.870
call your attention
to a couple of things.

05:24.870 --> 05:27.870
[people chattering indistinctly]

05:29.350 --> 05:30.450
What do you need?

05:30.670 --> 05:32.380
It occurred to us
once we arrived

05:32.380 --> 05:34.690
- that the event is at 4:00 in the afternoon.
- Mm.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.210
At 4:00 in the afternoon,

05:36.210 --> 05:38.810
the sun will be there
in the sky.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.810
Directly behind the stage.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.620
So?

05:43.100 --> 05:46.170
So I'm worried
it will blind the audience.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.190
Make it very difficult for them
to see your father

05:48.190 --> 05:50.220
or my boss, the ambassador.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.020
[laughs]

05:54.390 --> 05:55.840
This is the desert.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.640
The sun is always somewhere.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.360
No matter where
you move the audience,

05:59.360 --> 06:00.520
it will find them.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.340
Yes, but...

06:01.340 --> 06:03.100
Would you rather it
blind my father?

06:04.020 --> 06:06.090
Or for that matter,
your ambassador?

06:07.460 --> 06:08.650
Trust me.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.160
I know what I am doing.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.880
This is my home.

06:12.510 --> 06:13.630
My sun.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.530
[pats on arm]

06:14.530 --> 06:15.990
My oil, hmm?

06:16.390 --> 06:18.390
[grunts]

06:18.870 --> 06:20.870
[pounds twice on table]

06:20.870 --> 06:22.500
He is going to be here tomorrow.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.090
Six miles away.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.540
Him and his new Chinese friends.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.430
This timing is perfect.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.400
The image of his brother's
body hanging from the gallows

06:32.400 --> 06:34.110
is still fresh in everybody's minds.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.450
How do we not go
after him? [pounds twice]

06:37.610 --> 06:38.900
How do we not?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.830
It's simple.
We cannot, Ihab.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.680
We have no men,
we have no money

06:42.680 --> 06:43.600
and we have no guns.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.020
We don't need guns.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.810
We need a gun.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.560
We need someone to fire it

06:52.150 --> 06:54.230
at Jamal Al Fayeed.

06:55.590 --> 06:56.890
Boom.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.550
Bullet to the head.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.710
How do we do it, Ihab?

07:05.390 --> 07:07.970
How do we even get
into such an event?

07:08.280 --> 07:10.540
No.
We are all wanted men.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.810
We're all on the watch lists,

07:11.810 --> 07:13.330
our pictures are everywhere.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.030
I don't think my picture
is on any... watch list.

07:17.030 --> 07:20.240
Not as of this morning, Malik.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.320
Okay.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.820
If you can get a gun in there,

07:31.330 --> 07:33.420
with Allah's help...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.420
I will fire it.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.420
[vehicle approaching]

07:40.620 --> 07:42.420
[engine shuts off]
[car door opens]

07:42.420 --> 07:44.160
[car door closes]

07:44.160 --> 07:45.360
Mr. Al Fayeed?

07:45.410 --> 07:47.070
Your father wishes to see you.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.740
Come in, Ahmed.

07:53.750 --> 07:54.880
Close the door.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.520
I need your help
with something.

08:01.510 --> 08:02.770
What is it, Father?

08:05.600 --> 08:07.150
Who do you think
we should get

08:07.150 --> 08:10.660
to be the new
Minister of Energy Development?

08:11.960 --> 08:13.730
What are you talking about?

08:14.750 --> 08:16.650
I'm the Minister
of Energy Development.

08:16.650 --> 08:17.780
Are you?

08:18.720 --> 08:20.430
You think it's all right

08:20.600 --> 08:22.670
for the Minister of
Energy Development

08:22.670 --> 08:25.140
to show up for work
high on drugs?

08:25.150 --> 08:26.710
The son of the President?

08:26.710 --> 08:28.710
The next leader of Abuddin?

08:28.720 --> 08:29.950
You think it's wise,

08:29.950 --> 08:32.860
when a citizen of
a foreign government...

08:33.210 --> 08:35.730
a government with whom
we are trying to curry favor...

08:35.730 --> 08:38.710
points out that
you might have made a mistake,

08:38.710 --> 08:42.070
to lecture him about
whose sun it is?

08:42.669 --> 08:44.440
Whose oil it is?

08:52.610 --> 08:54.290
People hate you.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.170
They don't even know you,

08:58.170 --> 08:59.930
and they hate you.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.260
Why?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.620
Because you are my son.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.910
Because you've been given
everything

09:08.910 --> 09:10.660
they have been denied.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.550
They think you are a fat,
lazy slob.

09:17.220 --> 09:21.240
Why would you work so hard
to prove them right?

09:24.600 --> 09:26.730
If you don't want the job,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.090
just tell me.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.490
Either job.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.270
Minister of Energy Development

09:33.270 --> 09:35.820
[sighs] or my son.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.280
I want both.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.400
Good.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.020
'Cause they hate me, too.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.110
Together, we can prove
them wrong.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.110
[shivering]

10:38.110 --> 10:41.110

[utensils clinking]

12:28.380 --> 12:30.900
[Malik] If you ask me,
the greatest moment of my life?

12:31.730 --> 12:33.690
I tell you it was that moment.

12:34.350 --> 12:35.960
When you push the button.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.240
There is all this... heat.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.890
Light and screaming.

12:45.790 --> 12:48.050
And while that is happening,
you're thinking...

12:48.550 --> 12:49.870
"I'm still alive.

12:51.390 --> 12:52.920
I'm still alive."

12:54.210 --> 12:56.100
And it's amazing.

12:59.180 --> 13:01.620
And you know
you have done something good.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.390
You know you've done
something just.

13:07.430 --> 13:08.550
Malik?

13:08.550 --> 13:10.230
[rubbing hands]

13:10.230 --> 13:11.920
Understand this is...

13:11.920 --> 13:13.210
this is different.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.390
If we...

13:18.410 --> 13:20.290
If we go through with this,

13:21.750 --> 13:22.740
this is a gun.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.100
It's not a bomb.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.410
You might... Hey!

13:25.570 --> 13:27.000
You might not get away.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.770
I'm very clever.

13:30.570 --> 13:32.050
Very determined.

13:32.390 --> 13:34.820
And if I don't get away,

13:35.660 --> 13:37.480
but I get my target...

13:38.370 --> 13:40.060
I will still think,

13:40.730 --> 13:42.200
"This is amazing.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.080
I've done something good.

13:44.170 --> 13:45.970
I've done something just."

13:46.540 --> 13:49.540
And you will see me smile.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.930
What are you doing out here?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.450
We need you inside.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.810
Tell them I'm taking a shit.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.570
I'm telling them
you are a shit.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.320
Hey, watch your mouth!
[bread thuds on ground]

13:59.340 --> 14:00.780
You know who
these people are?!

14:00.780 --> 14:02.160
I have no idea.

14:02.310 --> 14:03.220
And I wouldn't be gloating

14:03.220 --> 14:05.280
about being with them
if I were you.

15:33.810 --> 15:36.400
No, no.
You're not hearing me.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.910
When we left the country,

15:37.960 --> 15:39.540
Mr. Cooper from
the State Department

15:39.540 --> 15:41.750
assured me that your office and
his office would do anything

15:41.750 --> 15:43.360
in their power to ensure that
my husband's body

15:43.360 --> 15:44.550
was returned to me.

15:44.550 --> 15:46.190
He said when
I woke up this morning,

15:46.190 --> 15:47.240
there would be
something in my e-mail

15:47.240 --> 15:49.310
from the Congressman's office.
Well, it's afternoon.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.790
There's nothing in my E-mail.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.100
I appreciate that
the Congressman is doing his best.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.920
Ye... Yes.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.860
I realize we have
no diplomatic relations

15:58.860 --> 16:00.790
with Abbudin
at the moment, but...

16:04.930 --> 16:07.050
Thank you, but please
tell the Congressman

16:07.050 --> 16:08.930
I don't need his sympathies.

16:08.930 --> 16:11.470
I just need him to bring
my husband's body home.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.470
[distant chatting heard]

16:14.730 --> 16:17.190
How long have those
people been outside the house?

16:17.190 --> 16:19.200
They've been out here
since I was up.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.100
Aunt Jenna says
we should call the police.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.030
Uh, that's more drama than
I can handle right now.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.990
I'm sure they'll go away
at some point.

16:26.370 --> 16:28.990
Everyone, uh, wants to know
when the memorial is.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.990
[prolonged moan]

16:33.320 --> 16:34.120
I don't know.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.130
I promise you, I'll figure it out.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.130
[prolonged sniff]

16:42.130 --> 16:43.470
[smooches]

16:43.470 --> 16:47.010
Baby... [sniff]
I think we just need to get out.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.050
Get some American coffee.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.670
Convince myself I'm actually home.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.190
I might, um, stop by my practice,

16:56.190 --> 16:57.650
make sure it's still there.

16:58.090 --> 16:59.130
You want to come with me?

17:00.260 --> 17:01.570
I don't know. I just...

17:02.920 --> 17:05.170
I... I don't think
I can face people today.

17:05.930 --> 17:06.940
You sure?

17:07.349 --> 17:08.069
Yeah.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.020
Okay.

17:11.190 --> 17:11.990
I love you.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.260
I love you, too.

17:17.260 --> 17:19.260
[exhaling sharply]

17:19.260 --> 17:21.130
[keys clanging]

17:21.130 --> 17:22.109
Where are my keys?

17:22.450 --> 17:24.050
I think Sammy took your car.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.430
Without asking?

17:26.950 --> 17:28.480
You could take Dad's car.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.480
[car door shut]

17:40.480 --> 17:44.480
[bird chirping in distance]

17:46.480 --> 17:49.480
[exhales and sighs]

17:49.480 --> 17:51.480
[pounds on wheel]

17:58.480 --> 18:02.480
[sighing]

18:02.480 --> 18:05.480
[breathing heavily]

18:10.080 --> 18:12.180
Excuse me, excuse me.
[people speaking all at once]

18:12.180 --> 18:14.280
Please, please, get out of my way.
[people speaking all at once]

18:14.340 --> 18:15.350
Excuse me.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.550
Excuse me.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.360
Thank you so much.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.800
Oh, Jesus.

18:28.980 --> 18:29.980
Yeah, come in.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.520
[door opens]

18:36.520 --> 18:37.300
Colonel?

18:39.120 --> 18:39.860
That's it?

18:41.080 --> 18:42.840
According to the
Highways Department,

18:42.840 --> 18:46.070
there are seven cameras
covering that intersection.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.820
You've seen everything.

18:47.980 --> 18:48.740
Right.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.840
Everything but his face.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.830
[gun thuds]

19:05.830 --> 19:06.640
What's that?

19:07.720 --> 19:08.620
A map.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.060
To help our young friend

19:10.070 --> 19:11.550
to find his way around.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.370
A friend of mine
owns the company

19:13.370 --> 19:15.770
that supplies the portable toilets.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.960
I'm going to give this to him.

19:18.630 --> 19:19.600
And he's going to make sure

19:19.600 --> 19:21.570
it's in there for Malik.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.160
Cancel the groundbreaking?!

19:27.790 --> 19:31.270
You asked me what I would do
to ensure nothing goes awry.

19:31.980 --> 19:33.360
Given the state of the country,

19:33.360 --> 19:34.620
this is what I would do.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.630
We have...
as you insisted...

19:37.630 --> 19:40.020
used measured
and proportionate

19:40.020 --> 19:41.580
retaliation tactics

19:41.580 --> 19:43.980
against Ihab Rashid
and his followers.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.790
But as the attack on the Ma'an

19:45.790 --> 19:49.280
checkpoint last
week demonstrated, they're still

19:49.280 --> 19:51.540
capable of wreaking havoc.

19:52.550 --> 19:55.140
Were we free to respond
in a more muscular way...

19:55.140 --> 19:58.660
[pounds on table] I'm trying
to convince the Chinese...

19:58.660 --> 20:01.830
I'm trying to convince
the world, that we are...

20:02.110 --> 20:05.880
that we are a peaceful
and friendly nation...

20:06.390 --> 20:08.770
anxious to do business...

20:09.280 --> 20:11.930
eager to welcome visitors.

20:12.090 --> 20:14.610
Canceling public celebration,

20:14.610 --> 20:16.200
dropping bombs,

20:16.210 --> 20:18.900
using gas against
our own people

20:18.900 --> 20:20.600
would make that difficult.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.860
Don't you think?

20:24.240 --> 20:25.330
Now then...

20:26.390 --> 20:28.460
since we are all in agreement

20:28.460 --> 20:33.130
that this ceremony
will continue as planned...

20:34.380 --> 20:37.450
review for me
the security precautions

20:37.460 --> 20:39.040
you've put in place.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.650
The entire site

20:47.960 --> 20:50.180
will be ringed
with armed soldiers.

20:50.260 --> 20:53.030
Credentialed guests
will make their way

20:53.030 --> 20:54.970
to appropriate gates...

20:55.590 --> 20:57.240
We found another camera.
[speech continues in background]

20:57.240 --> 20:58.850
The cash machine across the way.
[speech continues in background]

20:58.850 --> 21:00.360
- I think you should take a look.
- [Tariq] ...traditionally

21:01.210 --> 21:04.340
save for those with the
highest security clearance...

21:04.340 --> 21:07.340
[panting]

21:15.340 --> 21:17.740
[water running]

21:25.060 --> 21:27.060
[water splashing]

21:27.060 --> 21:29.120
Looks like
it's always been here,

21:29.120 --> 21:31.420
but it will all be gone
tomorrow.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.840
That's how the
Wadi works, Bassam.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.330
After the rain, it's a river.

21:36.330 --> 21:39.080
But by the next sun, it's dry.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.080
[water running and splashing]

21:44.080 --> 21:47.080
[Bassam panting]

21:47.610 --> 21:50.040
Well, just so you guys know,
I hated it.

21:51.590 --> 21:53.530
I hated being away from you.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.630
I hated being reminded
every day

21:57.070 --> 21:59.230
how powerless
I was to help your father.

21:59.350 --> 22:02.970
And it never once
seemed at all heroic.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.540
Mostly, it just seemed...

22:06.790 --> 22:09.900
pathetic and scary
and tedious.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.380
And incredibly lonely.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.150
Everybody thinks what
you did was amazing.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.970
Everybody thinks what
Dad did was amazing.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.920
Not everyone, some actually
think it was kind of stupid.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.190
[Emma] Sammy.
[cell phone ringing]

22:23.190 --> 22:26.190
[cell phone ringing]

22:33.370 --> 22:34.820
I... I... I... [stammering]
I'm sorry, I...

22:35.110 --> 22:35.710
I... I can't hear you.

22:35.710 --> 22:37.020
Wh... Who is this?

22:37.140 --> 22:38.340
It's Abdul.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.670
Ab... Abdul.

22:40.970 --> 22:44.790
Wow... Ehm...

22:44.790 --> 22:46.250
It... It's great to hear
your voice, man.

22:46.250 --> 22:49.020
H...How... [stammering]
What's going... What's going on?

22:49.050 --> 22:50.470
[Abdul] I'm so sorry.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.140
A... About your dad.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.170
About everything.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.170
Uhm...

22:57.010 --> 22:58.640
Yeah, uh...

22:59.240 --> 23:00.170
Thank you.

23:00.350 --> 23:02.780
[Abdul] It's unbelievable, man,
what he was trying to do.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.940
He gave up his life
to change things.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.940
And I knew him a little bit.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.580
Or at least I...
I feel like I did.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.720
So, anyway,
I'm thinking of heading to Ma'an.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.580
There's all kinds
of jobs there now.

23:16.580 --> 23:17.870
New oil fields and everything.

23:17.870 --> 23:20.160
Yeah, that's... that's good.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.180
That's... That's great.

23:24.510 --> 23:27.020
And look... I know

23:27.020 --> 23:29.410
we'll probably never
see each other again,

23:29.410 --> 23:31.300
but I...
I just wanted to tell you...

23:32.370 --> 23:33.500
I miss you.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.860
Oh...

23:37.860 --> 23:38.820
Thanks.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.460
Thank you, um...

23:41.970 --> 23:43.010
Me, too, man.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.540
I... I... I miss... [stammering]
I miss... I miss...

23:46.540 --> 23:48.540
[busy line signal]

23:52.540 --> 23:56.540
[thunder rumbling]

23:58.640 --> 24:02.640
[thunder strikes, rumbling sound]

24:10.640 --> 24:11.640
[gasps]

24:11.640 --> 24:15.640
[striking and rumbling continue]

24:19.070 --> 24:20.990
Rain, goddamn it, rain.

24:29.640 --> 24:34.640
[prolonged rumbling]

24:38.860 --> 24:39.790
What is your name?

24:40.060 --> 24:41.180
Jaleel Hosam.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.180
[slapping]

24:43.740 --> 24:44.650
What is your name?

24:45.360 --> 24:46.180
Hassam!

24:46.180 --> 24:47.250
Jaleel Hassam.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.320
Again, what is your name?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.670
Jaleel Hassam.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.280
You have a student credential.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.110
Where do you attend school?

24:53.120 --> 24:55.430
I go to school at the
Abuddinian Technical Institute.

24:55.430 --> 24:56.670
I study geology.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.860
I have been there for a...

24:58.470 --> 25:00.580
I study geology.
I have been there for a year.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.900
And I write for the student paper
called "The Bugle".

25:06.290 --> 25:08.080
Good. Good.

25:10.930 --> 25:11.850
And what if someone asks you

25:11.850 --> 25:13.200
why are you approaching
the stage?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.630
I'm going to get
a better picture for my paper.

25:16.350 --> 25:17.360
Where is the gun?

25:17.440 --> 25:19.650
Furthest men's toilet
furthest from the stage.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.910
First men's toilet
furthest from the stage.

25:22.910 --> 25:25.910
[paper rustling]

25:27.030 --> 25:28.870
You better not miss...
You better kill him.

25:28.870 --> 25:31.400
I had to trade
Mr. Hassam my car for this.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.370
He's Malik, yes?

25:42.530 --> 25:43.400
Your friend.

25:43.410 --> 25:44.530
Your colleague.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.880
It's hard to be sure.

25:52.230 --> 25:54.870
I've never seen
Malik dress like that.

25:55.170 --> 25:58.430
And his face is kind of blurry.

25:59.450 --> 26:00.630
How about this man?

26:02.490 --> 26:03.780
Ever see him around here?

26:06.310 --> 26:08.210
Maybe with Malik?

26:12.580 --> 26:14.490
I can see you're uncomfortable.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.840
And I don't want you to lie.

26:18.870 --> 26:23.510
You know, uh, people who lie,
sometimes they disappear.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.510
And are never seen again.

26:25.790 --> 26:28.330
So we don't want that.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.410
So... let's do this.

26:32.810 --> 26:33.930
[chair thuds]

26:33.930 --> 26:34.660
Now...

26:36.850 --> 26:40.220
if the answer is,
"Yes, you've seen this man",

26:40.690 --> 26:41.600
just say yes.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.460
Or better still,

26:44.190 --> 26:45.340
don't say anything.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.560
I'll know what you mean.

26:50.050 --> 26:54.290
That way, no one can
accuse you of lying.

26:55.370 --> 26:58.620
And no one can accuse you
of giving up your friend.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.510
So...

27:06.950 --> 27:09.290
have you ever seen
this man around here?

27:19.060 --> 27:22.560
[inhales and exhales]

27:26.170 --> 27:28.000
You are a brave young woman.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.220
Your country is
very proud of you.

27:48.220 --> 27:51.220
[footsteps approaching]

27:53.280 --> 27:55.480
Your new Minister
of Energy Development

27:55.480 --> 27:58.480
and his very pregnant bride
are already in the helicopter

27:58.480 --> 28:00.850
and are waiting to go
to the groundbreaking.

28:00.910 --> 28:05.330
Well, tell my new
Minister of Energy Development

28:05.430 --> 28:08.740
and his very pregnant bride

28:08.750 --> 28:10.420
that I will be right there.

28:11.420 --> 28:15.420
[footsteps departing]

28:15.420 --> 28:18.420
[exhaling sharply]

28:59.420 --> 29:03.420
[footsteps rustle in distance]

29:31.420 --> 29:34.420
[wind gusting]

29:34.420 --> 29:37.420
[sand rustling]

29:37.420 --> 29:40.420
[wind blowing]

29:42.420 --> 29:45.420
[whooshing]

29:45.420 --> 29:49.420
[wind howling]
[sand rustling]

29:58.420 --> 30:02.420
[howling and rustling continue]

30:38.420 --> 30:41.420
[whooshing]

30:43.420 --> 30:46.420
[sand storm passes]

31:11.420 --> 31:13.960
Allahu Akbar!

31:13.960 --> 31:15.960
[sobbing]

31:19.700 --> 31:22.260
Allahu Akbar!

31:22.260 --> 31:24.260
[sobbing]

31:28.750 --> 31:31.380
Allahu Akbar!

31:31.380 --> 31:33.380
[sobbing]

31:34.550 --> 31:35.970
God is great...

31:37.660 --> 31:39.250
God is great.

31:46.620 --> 31:49.920
[metal detector squeals]

31:49.920 --> 31:52.810
[over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.430
We are about to begin.

31:54.430 --> 31:56.350
[people chat indistinctly]

31:56.350 --> 31:59.260
[over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.920
We are about to begin.

32:03.420 --> 32:07.420
[applause]

32:14.500 --> 32:15.470
Thank you.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.480
Oil...

32:26.330 --> 32:28.310
has always been God's gift

32:28.310 --> 32:30.440
to the people of Abbudin.

32:32.190 --> 32:36.640
But this newest discovery
of an oil reserve here

32:36.640 --> 32:37.880
on the outskirts

32:37.880 --> 32:40.370
of Ma'an is a gift

32:40.370 --> 32:43.640
of almost incomprehensible wonder.

32:44.370 --> 32:46.930
Not only will it help fund

32:46.930 --> 32:49.150
schools, hospitals

32:49.150 --> 32:51.680
and roadways for decades,

32:52.240 --> 32:56.640
it will provide over 4,000 jobs.

32:56.640 --> 33:01.640
[Jamal's speech continues indistinctly]
[people applauding]

33:17.780 --> 33:20.000
Jobs, revenue,

33:20.220 --> 33:23.620
exciting new public
works projects...

33:23.620 --> 33:26.620
[speech continues]

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
[people applauding]

33:34.600 --> 33:38.020
All that dwarfs the real bounty

33:38.020 --> 33:41.270
that this new find bestows on us.

33:41.270 --> 33:44.210
[applause, cheering]

33:44.210 --> 33:45.220
Excuse me.

33:50.420 --> 33:53.520
Which is our newfound friendship

33:53.720 --> 33:56.200
with our partners from China.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.820
Two countries...

34:07.130 --> 34:09.440
one big and powerful,

34:09.699 --> 34:12.250
the other small
but determined...

34:12.280 --> 34:15.710
locking arms
and making their way...

34:15.710 --> 34:17.710
[gunshots]

34:17.710 --> 34:20.409
[people screaming]

34:20.409 --> 34:22.510
[gunshots]
[bullet cuts through air]

34:22.510 --> 34:24.510
[women screaming]

34:24.510 --> 34:26.510
[ambassador yelling in Chinese]

34:26.510 --> 34:28.510
[gunshot]

34:28.510 --> 34:31.000
[screaming continues]

34:31.000 --> 34:32.050
Ahmed!

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
[gunshots]

34:49.940 --> 34:52.250
G... Gentle.
You don't want to wake him up.

34:52.250 --> 34:53.620
He could be a killer.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.389
I'm not worried.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.480
He doesn't look
very scary to me.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.440
I'm more worried he'll be dead
before we have a chance

35:00.440 --> 35:03.090
to turn him in
and get the reward.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.460
You know what?

35:06.460 --> 35:07.850
I might just shoot him now.

35:08.460 --> 35:09.890
I think the reward
for an escaped prisoner

35:09.890 --> 35:12.880
is the same whether
he is alive or dead.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.360
Is that true?

35:14.680 --> 35:15.990
Do they pay
as much for a dead man

35:15.990 --> 35:17.540
as they do
for a living man?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.590
I saw it in a movie
on YouTube.

35:23.590 --> 35:26.590
[gasping in strength]

35:28.590 --> 35:31.390
[camel grunts]

35:34.640 --> 35:36.270
You think we're going to be rich?

35:37.610 --> 35:38.670
I think so.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.370
[bells tolling in distance]

35:43.370 --> 35:48.370
[takes a deep breath]

35:48.370 --> 35:51.370
[tolling continues]

35:57.930 --> 36:00.230
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

36:00.730 --> 36:03.730
[priest] And how long has it been
since your last confession?

36:04.370 --> 36:08.120
I think it was... 1997?

36:08.360 --> 36:11.470
[priest] Okay, would you mind
me asking

36:11.470 --> 36:14.060
what's kept you away
for this long?

36:15.330 --> 36:18.500
Well, I... met a man,

36:18.670 --> 36:20.630
and he wasn't Catholic.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.460
I married him.

36:23.030 --> 36:26.910
And how would he feel
about you being here today?

36:27.790 --> 36:31.430
Actually, I think
he's probably fine with it.

36:33.550 --> 36:34.910
He, uh...

36:37.480 --> 36:39.500
passed away a few days ago.

36:40.270 --> 36:42.270
[priest] Uh... Uh...

36:42.270 --> 36:44.140
Well, I'm.. I'm sorry.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.020
I'm, I... I truly am.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.310
It's okay.

36:49.070 --> 36:50.400
I think I just need

36:50.400 --> 36:52.230
someone to tell me
what to do.

36:54.150 --> 36:56.210
How to... grieve.

36:57.930 --> 36:59.890
How to breathe, how to...

37:01.170 --> 37:03.410
be a mother to my children.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.210
I've lived in this town
my whole life,

37:11.210 --> 37:14.120
and I... I feel like
I've never been here before.

37:15.970 --> 37:17.490
I...  I'm just...

37:18.210 --> 37:20.380
completely lost.

37:20.380 --> 37:23.380
[sighs]

37:23.380 --> 37:26.380
[choir starts singing]

38:03.340 --> 38:05.260
- You want to go?
- Okay.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.320
Hi.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.470
Hi.

38:07.470 --> 38:09.330
Uh, that was so nice

38:09.330 --> 38:10.060
what you did in there.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.720
I just wanted to say thank you.

38:11.730 --> 38:12.770
Not at all.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.170
Uh, Jimmy Timmons,
James Timmons.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.670
This is my daughter Leslie.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.270
She's home from
Stanford for the weekend.

38:18.270 --> 38:19.170
Hi.

38:19.730 --> 38:20.560
Nice to meet you.

38:20.560 --> 38:21.650
It's nice to meet you.

38:21.650 --> 38:22.880
I'm Molly...

38:22.990 --> 38:24.300
I know who you are.

38:24.530 --> 38:26.440
Everybody knows who you are.

38:27.330 --> 38:28.770
I'm so sorry.

38:28.770 --> 38:30.600
We're all so sorry.

38:32.190 --> 38:33.140
Thank you.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.720
I was four or five years
ahead of you in school.

38:37.970 --> 38:39.950
Um... you and
my sister Connie

38:39.960 --> 38:41.870
played field
hockey together.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.130
Uh, yeah, how's she doing?

38:45.130 --> 38:45.630
She's great.

38:45.630 --> 38:47.440
She's at the
University of New Mexico.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.950
She teaches Computer Ethics,
whatever that is.

38:49.950 --> 38:51.750
She has two lovely boys.

38:52.140 --> 38:53.480
Uh, Connie's brother.

38:57.350 --> 38:59.500
Um, wait for me
by the car, will you?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
[children playing]

39:02.520 --> 39:05.450
Oh, look, I know
you don't really know me from Adam,

39:05.730 --> 39:07.430
but I'm guessing
in the next couple weeks

39:07.430 --> 39:10.110
you're gonna be hit
with a hurricane of legal papers

39:10.110 --> 39:13.970
and lawyers and wills
and trusts and if can be of help...

39:14.190 --> 39:17.880
a second opinion or
even just somebody to talk to.

39:18.270 --> 39:19.430
I make a great cup of coffee

39:19.430 --> 39:21.480
and file a hell of a legal brief.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.720
I'm an attorney, by the way,
not a barista.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.810
That's very kind of you.

39:27.950 --> 39:28.900
Okay.

39:31.100 --> 39:36.100
[man singing in Arabic]

39:36.100 --> 39:38.100
[door opens]

39:43.100 --> 39:46.100
[singing continues]

39:48.900 --> 39:50.090
How is she?

39:51.720 --> 39:54.400
The bones in her upper arm
were fractured by the bullet.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.530
They've performed
one operation already.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.630
The finest doctors in China
will be arriving in the morning.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.210
They'll be doing
another procedure

40:01.210 --> 40:04.190
to prepare her arm
for a steel elbow.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.560
There are no words
to express how sorry...

40:15.070 --> 40:15.970
how horrible...

40:15.970 --> 40:17.420
Let's not.

40:22.210 --> 40:23.860
The man who did this...

40:23.860 --> 40:26.280
the man at whose behest
this was done

40:26.280 --> 40:27.950
is a terrorist.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.230
You must know
we are doing everything we can

40:31.230 --> 40:32.860
to apprehend him.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.320
[nervous laugh]

40:36.320 --> 40:37.530
How can I...?

40:40.730 --> 40:43.640
How can my nation

40:43.640 --> 40:45.620
make this enormous commitment

40:45.620 --> 40:47.530
to a country that cannot even

40:47.530 --> 40:50.280
keep my own wife safe?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.400
I don't think there's
anything else to discuss.

40:55.410 --> 40:58.540
In the morning, my staff
will meet with your staff

40:59.000 --> 41:00.320
and we will begin the work

41:00.320 --> 41:02.080
of unwinding our various

41:02.080 --> 41:04.510
commitments to each other.

41:06.510 --> 41:07.780
Listen to me.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.410
This will be taken care of.

41:10.410 --> 41:13.500
It will be handled
swiftly and certainly.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.850
By the time
you wake up tomorrow,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.490
we will have this man's head
on a stick.

41:20.490 --> 41:22.210
His movement will be dead.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.500
Any threat eradicated.

41:25.670 --> 41:28.020
And we will proceed
with our project.
