00:54.900 --> 00:56.900
You know it's not too late
to go to Nikki Beach.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.200
The guys are cuter.

00:59.100 --> 00:59.800
Let's walk.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.600
You want to walk
to Nikki Beach?

01:02.600 --> 01:03.800
All right, you are drunker than I am.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.900
Maybe we'll get lucky.

01:12.100 --> 01:12.900
Scary.

01:15.100 --> 01:15.900
Sexy.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.700
Hop on.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.600
Well, he's kind of like a cab.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.500
Hey, you know where
Nikki Beach is?
Whoa, no, no, no.

01:22.700 --> 01:26.700
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.
It's cheaper than a cab.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.900
We can't even
both fit on there.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.100
The way I plan
to hold on to him,

01:31.500 --> 01:32.400
we can.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.600
See, Shell?

01:40.900 --> 01:43.300
You know what, I'm just going
to have the valet guy call me a cab.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.400
But I'll meet you there.

01:47.100 --> 01:47.900
Hey...

01:48.000 --> 01:48.800
Hey, you...

01:49.100 --> 01:50.400
don't you want
to know my name?

02:30.500 --> 02:33.100
Oh, my God. What happened?
Shelly?

02:37.600 --> 02:40.000
Help! Someone!

02:45.700 --> 02:46.800
Detective Berkeley.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.700
Dispatch said
we have a stabbing.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.200
I'd say multiple.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.300
Okay, and her clothes
indicate a sexual assault.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.600
She's got biological
fluid on her thighs.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.800
I didn't touch the body.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.000
I used a mirror.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.600
I'll have Dr. Woods
collect a kit as soon as she gets in.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.500
Let's do that.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.300
I noticed that the binding
looks like fishing line.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
Please stop!
Please leave me alone!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.300
You swept the house?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.700
Couldn't find anything
made of that material.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.200
Okay, and we have no sign
of the murder weapon?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.700
Tore the place apart. Nothing.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.500
That means that our guy
brought a killing kit.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.700
So he brings the tools to the murder
and takes them when he leaves.

03:30.700 --> 03:31.700
That's correct.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.700
That's hard-core.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.800
These wounds are just brutal.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.700
I'll get the sexual assault kit
to the lab.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.900
Okay. Tell me
about the knife.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.400
There may be two.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.700
How do you mean two?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.700
These incised wounds
have serrated margins,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.100
but this cut...

03:57.800 --> 03:59.000
the margin is clean.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.800
Alexx, is that a "Y"?

04:02.300 --> 04:03.000
It is.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.700
But there's no blood,

04:04.700 --> 04:06.800
so this was done postmortem.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.300
<i>He'd already killed her.</i>

04:08.300 --> 04:10.100
<i>Now he was spending time
with her.</i>

04:12.200 --> 04:14.000
From a straight-edge blade.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.100
Yes.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.700
Alexx, that "Y" could be
a signature.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.399
So he used one blade for killing

04:21.300 --> 04:23.300
and one for leaving a message.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.900
So you did not see Shelly
in the rearview of the motorcycle?

05:16.900 --> 05:17.700
No.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.800
Did you see anyone
approach her--

05:19.900 --> 05:21.000
anyone hitting on her?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.300
A lot of guys were
waiting for their cars.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.400
I figured she'd get a ride.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.100
What about the guy
on the motorcycle?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.900
Do you think he could have seen
someone approach her?

05:30.400 --> 05:31.200
Maybe.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.100
But I don't know his name.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.700
I'm sorry.
You don't know his name?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.300
He paid for bottle service
at Nikki Beach.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.400
But when I wouldn't... you know,
pay him back,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.100
he got mad and left.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.200
He left?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.700
When I told him where I lived,
he said it was too far,

05:48.700 --> 05:51.300
so I went for eggs at Duke's...

05:52.300 --> 05:53.100
and then came home.

05:53.900 --> 05:57.900
What time approximately did this
motorcycle guy leave you at Nikki Beach?

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
5:00, 5:30.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.800
Frees him up
during time of death.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.500
I gave him the address.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.900
I'm such an idiot.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.300
Alexis, you're not an idiot.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.900
And, in fact, you can
really help us

06:11.900 --> 06:14.500
if you could remember the exact
cabana number you were in.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.800
I don't remember
the number,

06:19.500 --> 06:21.300
but I can probably show you
where it is.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.200
No, that one.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.200
It's okay.
Take your time.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.700
No, it was that one
with the broken chaise.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.700
Are you sure?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.700
I remember 'cause his boots
were too heavy and kind of fell through.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.500
I'm drinking my slow
screw on the beach.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.300
I like the sound of that.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.400
Damn!

06:56.700 --> 06:57.700
That broke his mood.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.900
What about
the umbrella?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.500
This is the only
cabana without one.

07:01.100 --> 07:01.800
He threw it.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.600
First I thought he was
going to throw it at me.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.700
<i>He threw it 'cause
I wouldn't have sex.</i>

07:07.700 --> 07:10.100
You're nothing
but a tease.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.900
If I'm lucky, that's metal.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.500
How'd your court appearance go?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.500
Not too important
in light of the fact we've got a night job

08:05.500 --> 08:07.300
carving wires into his victims.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.700
Oh, you're working
my case now?

08:09.300 --> 08:10.300
I'm working a homicide.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
My homicide.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.500
Prior victims
were all in Boston.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.000
All bound with fishing wire.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.200
Serrated-edge knife...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.400
and "Y" with the smooth one.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.000
What does the "Y" stand for?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.600
Nobody knows.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.400
No suspect names?

08:30.700 --> 08:31.700
No suspects.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.600
Three killings in Boston
and then none.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.400
Well, he's either inactive...

08:38.500 --> 08:39.600
or he's moved to Miami.

08:40.900 --> 08:41.400
Yeah.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.500
So you picked up a girl
outside a club

09:17.500 --> 09:19.100
and now her roommate is dead.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.600
Well, I invited that one
to come with.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.800
She didn't want to.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.800
Hey, you know where Nikki Beach is?
Whoa, no, no, no.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.000
Hop on.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.000
Did you jump her roommate
at Nikki Beach

09:30.000 --> 09:31.300
so you could go over
and kill her?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.100
We know you had her address.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.300
Hey, last I saw, she didn't want
to get on my bike.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.100
And then her friend started
yapping in my ear--

09:39.500 --> 09:40.600
did I know her name?

09:41.300 --> 09:42.300
Never looked back again.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.700
Frank, check his knife, please.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.800
Serrated near the hilt,
flat edge near the tip.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.300
One knife for MO
and signature.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.800
What the hell's that mean?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.200
It means
don't go far.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.700
Is the biker's
knife a match?

11:25.500 --> 11:26.300
Mm...

11:26.600 --> 11:29.900
Shelly was killed with a knife
that had a six-inch serrated blade.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.500
Travis' blade is serrated
for only about an inch.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.400
Do you have anything,
and I mean anything at all?

11:34.700 --> 11:36.700
I found skin
underneath her fingernails.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.600
Accordioned.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.200
You find your guy...

11:39.200 --> 11:40.700
He's gonna look like
he's been in a fight.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.500
With a cat.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.500
That Boston, Frank?

11:49.800 --> 11:52.200
Spoke to an Officer Malloy.
It's his case up there.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.700
Confirms the MOs
are the same.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.500
College girls
stumbling out of clubs...

11:56.500 --> 11:57.800
they never saw the sun rise.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.000
Travis Peck?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.300
Never a person of interest.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.900
In fact, the killer
was really good.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.700
He left almost nothing
behind in any of his scenes.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.900
Define "almost."

12:06.700 --> 12:09.800
Well, they recovered fishing line
tied around the victims' hands and

12:10.100 --> 12:12.600
fish scales on the wound
of his first Boston victim.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.500
Fish scale.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.500
Yeah. Marine biologist
identified it

12:17.500 --> 12:19.000
in Latin as

12:20.000 --> 12:21.700
"Sciaenops ocellatus."

12:21.700 --> 12:23.200
Redfish, Frank.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.700
Yeah, very popular
up in Boston.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.300
If he's looking to catch from down here,
there's only one spot.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800
Mosquito Lagoon.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.600
Let's go.

12:53.700 --> 12:54.400
Frank.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.300
Think that's our guy?

12:56.700 --> 12:58.600
Scratches are not fresh.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.200
But those are.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.700
Just about to gut her.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.500
Y'all want to watch?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.200
Grab his knife, Frank.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.900
I got four hours
on my shift, man.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.100
Your shift is over.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.400
You never expect to see your one-night
stand leading off the morning edition.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
So, Lucas,

13:34.600 --> 13:35.900
you admit
to knowing her?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
Shelly Seaver?

13:37.800 --> 13:38.900
Picked her up at a club.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.100
We had, uh, like interests.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
Well, that looks tasty.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.400
Hey.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Friend ditched you, huh?

13:53.700 --> 13:55.400
Uh, yeah, but...

13:55.700 --> 13:56.900
she's my roommate, so...

13:57.000 --> 13:57.900
no hard feelings.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.400
I'll make sure
you get ho safe.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.700
Sure.

14:07.900 --> 14:08.700
And then you killed her?

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
Can't cop to that.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.500
Sorry.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
Is that all you got, guys?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.600
If I were you, I'd sit down.

14:25.200 --> 14:25.900
Why?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.400
You want to pin other
Miami murders on me?

14:28.800 --> 14:32.400
Actually, we're talking
about Boston murders.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.500
Boston?

14:35.300 --> 14:37.100
That's right. We forgot
to mention that we know

14:37.400 --> 14:38.600
you used to live in Boston,

14:38.600 --> 14:41.900
and similar murders
just happened to stop right after you moved.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.400
and now,

14:45.900 --> 14:47.400
all of them are gonna stop.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.300
What is it, Sergeant Stetler?
I'm busy.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.700
Besides, I already
got one of your IAB hacks

15:08.700 --> 15:10.100
looking over my shoulder

15:10.100 --> 15:12.300
while I go over every case
I've ever worked.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.200
Yeah, to get out
ahead of appeals, I know.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.900
So if you don't mind,
the sooner I finish,

15:17.200 --> 15:18.800
the sooner
I'll be reinstated.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.800
Well...

15:21.500 --> 15:22.400
maybe not.

15:25.100 --> 15:25.800
What do you mean?

15:26.300 --> 15:29.200
Well, I figured a guy gambles on duty,
he's got to get lucky every now and then,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
so we checked your bank records.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
What's your point?

15:32.400 --> 15:33.300
My point...

15:33.900 --> 15:36.500
about a month
before you transferred out of patrol to CSI,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.600
you made a cash deposit
in the amount of $6,400.

15:41.100 --> 15:41.900
Where'd that come from?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.000
I honestly have no idea.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.000
Well, I think
you better go through every

15:51.000 --> 15:53.900
speeding ticket and
moving violation you issued

15:53.900 --> 15:54.700
and get one.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.100
Do you honestly think

15:59.100 --> 16:01.500
that I took money
from a traffic stop?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.900
I didn't think
that you would gamble on duty.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.400
So now, account for that money
before day's end

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
or it's over.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.400
For real, Wolfe.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.600
Hey.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.100
Hey.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.600
With Lucas Wade in custody,

16:28.100 --> 16:30.000
looks like we can finally
have that dinner.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.600
Well, those are
famous last words.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.900
You know every time we try,
something happens.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.400
Should we just say it's a sign?

16:36.700 --> 16:39.600
No, I'm just gonna have to work
harder to finish earlier.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.000
Excuse me.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.800
I was wondering if
one of you might help me.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.200
Do you know where
I go to post bail?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.900
For whom would you
like to post bail?

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
Lucas Wade.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.500
He's my brother.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.200
There hasn't been
a bail hearing yet.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
I just assumed.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.500
He called and said
to come get him.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.300
Miss Wade, he may
not get bail.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.700
Look, if there's any more info,
could you call me?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.400
Absolutely.
We can do that.

17:04.900 --> 17:05.800
Miss Wade, why don't
you come inside

17:05.800 --> 17:07.800
so we can better explain to you
what's going on with your brother.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.000
Okay.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.000
Hey. Everything okay?

17:31.800 --> 17:32.600
Yeah.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.600
Just got the DNA results
from Lucas Wade's semen sample.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.800
The DNA from our victim's
body matches Lucas Wade.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.000
But that doesn't prove
that he killed our victim.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.400
It only proves
he had sex with her.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.300
Oh, but this might.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.900
The amelogenin Y is twice as
concentrated as it should be.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.500
The donor's XYY.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.200
So he has an extra Y chromosome?

17:52.800 --> 17:53.900
That's the criminal gene.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.000
Well, that's what
they used to call it.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.600
Some studies from the '70s
said that an extra Y chromosome

17:58.600 --> 18:00.400
meant a man was
more aggressive.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.600
So Wade was born to kill.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.600
That's why he carves the Y
on his victims' chest.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.700
Means he's aware
of his condition.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.400
Wonder how much he knows.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.500
I think it's time to talk
to someone who can tell us.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.000
Can I get my brother now?

18:18.300 --> 18:19.800
I'm afraid not,
Miss Wade.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.500
Your brother has an
extra Y chromosome.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.800
Now this is where most people would
usually ask me what on earth I'm talking about.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.900
Um...

18:32.400 --> 18:34.700
when Lucas was born,
he was part of a study

18:34.700 --> 18:37.300
that tested for genetic defects.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.400
At a prestigious
Boston university.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.800
I'm familiar
with the study.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
Is that where the abnormality
was first discovered?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.800
They told my parents that
he had the criminal gene,

18:48.800 --> 18:51.100
that he was prone to violence.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
He exhibited signs of it
early on,

18:55.400 --> 18:59.000
killing animals
and bullying kids at school.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.200
How did your parents
react to that?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.200
My dad called him a freak...

19:04.600 --> 19:05.500
...a mistake.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.100
I tried to be there for him.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.300
He just became unreachable.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.900
So even though that
theory was debunked,

19:15.900 --> 19:17.200
the damage had been done.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.800
Your brother thought
he was born to kill.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.800
And that's when the
Boston killings started.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.600
I never thought that
that could be him.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.600
Call me crazy,
but I still don't.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.100
He's your brother.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.200
I understand.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.900
Miss Wade, I do think
it's entirely possible

19:36.900 --> 19:38.900
that you may have to face that
as a reality.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.900
The Y marking's consistent
with this morning's killing.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.600
We're still looking
for the murder weapon.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.900
Victim's name is Jennifer Royce.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.100
She died in the
last three hours.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.100
Lucas Wade has been
in our custody for four.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.700
Who called it in, Eric?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.600
Her son, Arthur.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.800
Came home from school,
found her like this.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
He won't talk to anyone.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.700
He'll talk to me.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.600
Arthur, my name's Horatio Caine.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.800
Can you tell me what happened?

20:52.400 --> 20:53.800
The door was open after school.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.300
Mom never leaves it like that.

20:57.200 --> 20:57.900
Okay.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.000
Did you see anyone leaving?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.400
I heard something
in the kitchen.

21:03.900 --> 21:04.800
I don't know.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.200
Is he coming back?
Arthur,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.900
I don't want you
to worry about him.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.900
You're safe now.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.400
Is he coming back for it?

21:13.500 --> 21:14.800
What do you mean "for it," son?

21:15.300 --> 21:16.300
What are you
talking about?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.100
He forgot this.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.100
I took it out of my mom.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.100
I didn't want it
to hurt her anymore.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.700
Arthur, you're very brave.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.300
Thank you.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.100
I appreciate your help, son.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.400
What's the story
with this knife?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.700
That knife killed Jennifer Royce
and Shelly Seaver.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.000
The DNA confirms it.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.900
So we've got just
one murder weapon.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.900
Which supports the theory that
someone other than Lucas Wade did this.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.200
But then why would
they leave the knife?

21:48.700 --> 21:51.000
It seems like the son came
home and scared him off.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.900
Wait a second.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.100
This has a changeable blade.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.200
Whoever put the blade into the housing
accidentally preserved their own print.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.900
I see something here.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.200
Yeah.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.000
Bingo.
Yeah.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.400
Rita Bolton?

22:46.600 --> 22:50.100
Okay, he's my boyfriend.
So what?

22:50.100 --> 22:52.600
No, Rita,
Lucas is a serial killer,

22:52.600 --> 22:54.000
and you could have helped us
catch him,

22:54.200 --> 22:56.200
but instead,
you stabbed someone

22:56.400 --> 22:57.600
to help him look innocent.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800
<i>You did it
while we had Lucas in custody.</i>

23:05.500 --> 23:07.000
I'd like to see you prove that.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.000
How about we've got your
fingerprints on the knife

23:09.000 --> 23:10.500
that was used
to kill two people?

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
All I did was help pack
his fishing kit for him.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.400
You need anything else, sweetie?

23:33.700 --> 23:34.800
Just fish biting.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.100
Happy hunting.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.500
It always is.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.400
Be back tomorrow.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.600
No, what you did was pack
his murder kit and that makes you an accomplice.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.500
I didn't know.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.400
I thought he was going fishing.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.400
No, he went
to kill Shelly Seaver.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
What happens now?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
You're still a suspect
in the copycat murder,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.500
but you just convicted
your boyfriend.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
Can we stop for food?

24:29.200 --> 24:31.800
I hear they got a baloney sandwich
waiting for you at the jail.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.400
Put your arms down.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.800
I'm just getting comfy.
These things are heavy...

24:48.800 --> 24:50.800
I don't care.
Put your arms down.

24:52.100 --> 24:52.800
What was that?

24:54.900 --> 24:55.600
Hang on!

25:48.300 --> 25:49.100
I've got an officer down.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.800
Request medical assistance
immediately!

25:51.300 --> 25:52.000
Immediately!

25:52.000 --> 25:53.900
Jake, Jake...

25:54.400 --> 25:55.100
I'm okay.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.100
Sorry, I didn't see that coming.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.800
Okay. Neither will he, brother.
Neither will he.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.100
That's a dead officer, Eric.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.800
The case just became capital.

26:25.900 --> 26:26.600
How's Jake?

26:26.600 --> 26:27.800
He's banged up pretty bad.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.300
I just sent him
to the hospital.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.900
Lucas escaped into those woods
over there.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.300
All right, I'll get the metal
detector and check it out.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.700
Do that, Eric.
We've got a cop-killer.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.400
I spoke the ER.
Jake is going to be okay.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.300
I'm sure he would love for you
to go visit him at the hospital.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.200
Hey, you know what?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.900
I came to see you
at the hospital, too.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.300
Yeah, that was different.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.300
It is different

26:58.600 --> 27:00.200
because you and I
work together.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.900
You work with Jake, too.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.200
He's in Homicide.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.500
You and I are in the lab
day and night.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.700
You know that I trust you
with my life.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.000
I don't even know
how I feel about Jake yet.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.400
All right, maybe we should
get back to work.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.300
We got something.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.400
Somebody cut the handcuffs off
and then buried them.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.600
It confirms he's got
an accomplice.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.400
Lucky for us
no one stepped on them.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.600
Whoever kicked the dirt
around it

28:01.600 --> 28:02.900
left a real nice footprint.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.100
It's a biker boot.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.300
And I know exactly which biker.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.800
We found that tire iron
on your motorcycle.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.100
Do my own repairs.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.700
Well, that's a miracle, since
motorcycles don't use them.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.700
You did time in Boston.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.500
Yeah, Cedar Junction.
A lot of guys did time there.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.900
How many guys domiciled in a cell
next to Lucas Wade for a year?

28:41.500 --> 28:42.600
The list shrinks to you.

28:45.200 --> 28:45.900
All right.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.300
Let's start it simple.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.600
Lucas see a girl he liked,
she had a friend,

28:52.600 --> 28:55.700
I'd step in, make sure
she didn't get in the way.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.900
That's the one, the blonde.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
I'll keep her friend
out of your way for a couple of hours.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.800
Saddle up, cowboy.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.400
So you helped him
kill a girl.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.600
Then you loosened lug nuts
on a police vehicle after he got caught.

29:22.500 --> 29:26.000
What he's doing...
is what we all want to.

29:26.900 --> 29:27.800
He's a hunter.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.700
I understand him.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.000
Really? Well...

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
wannabe...

29:35.700 --> 29:37.000
help us understand that.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.800
Why'd Lucas choose
this woman?

29:44.800 --> 29:46.200
No, he'd never pick
this chick.

29:47.200 --> 29:47.700
Too old,

29:47.700 --> 29:49.800
hair's too dark.
Did you kill her

29:49.900 --> 29:51.000
while he was in custody?

29:52.100 --> 29:52.900
Wish I did.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.400
Wonder what it feels like
to kill a person.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.700
Well, you're in luck.

30:01.100 --> 30:01.700
Why?

30:02.200 --> 30:04.300
A police officer died
in that van.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.400
Makes you guilty
of felony murder.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.600
So, how does it feel?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.200
Just give me a second.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.000
Hey, Natalia.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.100
Ryan, what's wrong?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I could have stopped Lucas Wade.
Do you know that?

30:42.700 --> 30:44.200
What are you talking about?
You're not even on his case.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.100
I pulled him over
a few years ago.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.700
He gave
a Boston address.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.500
He was driving slowly
and suspiciously, and, uh...

30:55.400 --> 30:56.900
I should have known
something was up.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.000
I thought he was
just another tourist.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.400
You are being way too hard
on yourself.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.500
The Green River Killer,
the Night Stalker--

31:04.600 --> 31:05.800
they were pulled over

31:06.000 --> 31:07.400
before they were
finally arrested.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.600
Those aren't on me.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.600
This one is.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.300
Who knows how many women
I could have saved?

31:21.900 --> 31:22.900
How's it going?

31:22.900 --> 31:26.900
Boston finally got us
the autopsy protocols from their "Y" killer.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.100
These three
are from Boston.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.500
This last one,
Shelly Seaver from this morning.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.600
Okay, so will you tell me
what I'm looking for?

31:35.800 --> 31:37.300
Angle of entry.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.800
The skin tore to the left
when Wade stuck his blade in

31:42.900 --> 31:44.200
to make his signature.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.500
Consistent with him
being right-handed.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.600
Exactly.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.500
Approach from the right,
tear to the left.

31:55.100 --> 31:55.700
Now...

31:57.600 --> 31:59.100
here's Jennifer Royce.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
It's torn the opposite way.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.300
Which means our killer
is left-handed.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.700
Lefties do a lot of things
opposite.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.900
Angle of handwriting,

32:16.500 --> 32:17.700
keys in pocket.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.700
The way they wear their watches

32:20.500 --> 32:23.400
because it's easier
to work the clasp with the dominant hand.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Look, if there's any more info,
could you call me?

32:27.800 --> 32:29.100
Absolutely. We can do that.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.500
It's the sister.

32:55.100 --> 32:55.900
Miss Wade,

32:55.900 --> 32:57.500
Miss Wade,you're under arrest.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.500
I'm sorry I killed her, but...

33:04.600 --> 33:05.700
Lucas is my brother.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.300
He had to look innocent.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.300
Miss Wade, who attacked you?

33:11.300 --> 33:14.000
My brother.
I thought he came
here to hide.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.400
Holly? Holly?
Where is she?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.100
Leave my little girl
out of this.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.800
Lucas, please!

33:20.800 --> 33:21.600
Get off!

33:32.100 --> 33:35.100
My baby. Oh, my God, my baby!

33:36.500 --> 33:37.900
Okay, we'll find him.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.900
Attention all units!

33:43.050 --> 33:46.150
Amber Alert: missing child
less than 24 hours.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.950
Holly Wade, two years old,

33:48.350 --> 33:49.450
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

33:49.450 --> 33:52.150
Suspected kidnapper armed and dangerous.

34:00.750 --> 34:01.950
Will you tell me
what you're looking for?

34:02.650 --> 34:06.350
Lindsay couldn't tell us where her brother went,
so something has to.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.850
I have a hard time feeling sorry for her,
since she killed Jennifer Royce,

34:11.949 --> 34:14.050
and, I think she's probably
covering for him.

34:14.850 --> 34:16.050
He has her little girl,
Calleigh.

34:16.850 --> 34:18.550
Yeah, but still,
she's a murderer.

34:19.949 --> 34:21.250
Family psychologies run deep.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.250
They make you do things
you never thought you were capable of.

34:28.850 --> 34:29.750
Yeah, you're right.

34:32.050 --> 34:32.949
So you mind
finishing up here?

34:32.949 --> 34:34.449
I'm gonna go check on something.

34:38.350 --> 34:39.850
I'll collect the
little girl's things.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.050
Any luck?

34:56.449 --> 34:59.050
No. No trace of
Lucas on anything.

35:01.550 --> 35:02.550
He bugged himself.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.950
This is the receiving
end of a child locator.

35:05.750 --> 35:06.750
You know this how?

35:07.050 --> 35:09.150
'Cause I got nieces and they all
have these little teddy bears

35:09.150 --> 35:10.650
that are attached
to their shoelaces.

35:13.950 --> 35:15.750
So this is going to
tell us where he is?

35:16.050 --> 35:17.050
Well, here is the bad news.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.850
The bad news is it only has
a range of about 150 yards.

35:20.950 --> 35:23.050
Okay, so how are we
going to narrow it down?

35:23.050 --> 35:25.350
Lucas Wade isn't going to go
anywhere we can find him.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.550
Unless one of us already did.

35:31.850 --> 35:33.150
You got more bad
news for me?

35:33.250 --> 35:33.950
Not at all.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.450
Remember I said you weren't
working on this case?

35:37.450 --> 35:38.150
Yeah.

35:38.850 --> 35:39.750
That was so wrong.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.750
Really?
Well, how can I help you?

35:43.050 --> 35:45.450
That ticket that you gave Wade
when you caught him prowling--

35:45.450 --> 35:47.650
where was it?
Uh...

35:51.050 --> 35:53.450
It was at a warehouse
in Pinecrest. Why?

35:53.950 --> 35:55.450
Well, you may not have
caught him the first time,

35:55.750 --> 35:57.050
but I think
you just made up for it.

36:12.650 --> 36:14.650
<i>So, I'm looking at
old Boston Herald</i>

36:14.650 --> 36:16.250
microfiche... why?

36:16.950 --> 36:18.650
Searching for hits
on Lucas Wade.

36:18.650 --> 36:19.950
There's something
we're missing.

36:20.250 --> 36:21.850
It's easy to see why
parents believe it

36:21.850 --> 36:23.550
when a study says
something is true.

36:23.550 --> 36:24.350
People listen.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.650
Wait. So the extra Y chromosome
doesn't lead to violence?

36:28.750 --> 36:29.250
I looked into it.

36:29.250 --> 36:31.150
There's no science
to support it.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.650
The extra Y means
nothing at all.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.350
So what makes
this guy a killer?

36:38.750 --> 36:39.550
That does.

36:42.150 --> 36:43.150
He killed his sister.

36:43.950 --> 36:45.350
And Lindsay was an eyewitness.

36:46.450 --> 36:47.750
I'm not so sure that's true.

36:51.750 --> 36:54.250
You know, I kept thinking
about Jennifer Royce.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.550
And then I was
wondering about you

36:56.550 --> 36:57.950
and how could a
30-year-old woman

36:57.950 --> 37:00.050
kill so easily on
the spur of the moment?

37:00.250 --> 37:01.450
And then I realized...

37:01.950 --> 37:04.550
that your brother was
the only one who knew that you had
killed before.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.450
That's not what it says
in the article.

37:10.050 --> 37:11.950
Your baby sister Emma
was four years old.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.050
She was standing at
the top of the stairs.

37:15.350 --> 37:17.450
You were six.
Lucas was eight.

37:17.850 --> 37:21.250
Only he did not push herfor taking his turn.
In fact...

37:21.250 --> 37:22.350
It was an accident.

37:22.450 --> 37:24.750
But it was not his.
It was yours, wasn't it?

37:26.850 --> 37:28.650
Miss Wade, they may have
believed you in Boston,

37:28.650 --> 37:31.150
but I am not buying it,
so let's hear it.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.650
Mom was taking a nap.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.650
<i>We were sledding
down the stairs.</i>

37:45.550 --> 37:47.250
And you pushed
Emma too hard.

37:52.650 --> 37:54.650
Mommy, Mommy, come quick!

37:56.350 --> 37:57.950
Oh, my God, what happened?!

37:58.350 --> 37:59.350
Lucas did it.

37:59.850 --> 38:00.650
No, I didn't.

38:00.750 --> 38:01.850
Course you did.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.650
They warned us about you.

38:03.850 --> 38:04.850
Get out of my sight!

38:11.950 --> 38:14.350
Be very easy to blame
your brother because he was...

38:15.650 --> 38:16.550
born bad?

38:18.850 --> 38:20.550
I never forgave myself.

38:21.150 --> 38:22.750
That's why you killed
the second time.

38:23.350 --> 38:24.250
To save him.

38:27.650 --> 38:29.250
You figured if
there was a Y murder

38:29.250 --> 38:31.750
while he was in custody,
we'd have to drop the charges.

38:34.150 --> 38:35.650
The first time
was an accident,

38:35.750 --> 38:37.050
but Jennifer Royce
is murder.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.750
What about my baby?

38:40.950 --> 38:42.250
Don't worry, Miss Wade.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.450
We actually do know
how to save people.

38:56.950 --> 38:58.750
We've pulled over Lucas on this block.

39:00.050 --> 39:02.850
When it's in range, it'll beep,
but on his end, too.

39:03.350 --> 39:06.050
Yeah. So that means we
need to be good to go.

39:06.950 --> 39:08.250
Wait a minute. H.

39:09.750 --> 39:10.450
Eric...

39:11.050 --> 39:11.950
This is it.

39:31.450 --> 39:32.450
Lucas.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.350
You don't understand, Caine.

39:42.350 --> 39:43.550
I do understand, Lucas.

39:43.550 --> 39:44.950
Lindsay killed your sister,

39:44.950 --> 39:46.150
but let Holly go.

39:48.150 --> 39:48.850
I can't.

39:49.350 --> 39:50.850
I have to protect her
from Lindsay.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.450
And I have to protect
her from you.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.350
Let her go, Lucas.

39:59.150 --> 40:00.150
I wasn't going to hurt her.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.050
Prove it, Lucas.

40:03.550 --> 40:04.950
Get down on the ground
right now.

40:08.450 --> 40:09.250
Cuff him.

40:22.150 --> 40:23.150
Holly, it's okay.

40:23.450 --> 40:24.050
Come here.

40:24.050 --> 40:24.750
Come on, now.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.550
Ready?
One, two... three.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.750
<i>Mommy, Mommy, come quick!</i>

41:01.750 --> 41:03.150
Oh, my God, what happened?!

41:03.450 --> 41:04.550
Lucas did it.

41:04.550 --> 41:05.850
No, I didn't.
