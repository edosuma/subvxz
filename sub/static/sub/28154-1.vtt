11:29.920 --> 11:30.990
What is the plan?

11:33.450 --> 11:34.860
No plans.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.300
Just work.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.400
Oh no!

11:57.110 --> 11:59.050
Oh man, I tell you.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.950
I'm so happy that I got rid
of the crazy bitch.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.520
I bet you did.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.160
Well, I never had a better fuck,

12:08.190 --> 12:11.830
but her stupid slipslop
was too much for me.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.460
Yeah.

12:13.490 --> 12:17.000
I hope this cunt gets her stuff
off my home until I'm back.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.840
Hope you had
a better weekend?

12:22.570 --> 12:24.170
It was alright.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.910
You're talking
so much, aren't you?

18:50.860 --> 18:51.890
Wait, wait.

18:53.430 --> 18:54.800
I-- I love you.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.280
Can I pick one banana?

20:54.980 --> 20:55.880
Thanks.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.530
Hey! Hey, man. How are you?

23:27.570 --> 23:29.470
Sure you should be out so late?

23:29.500 --> 23:32.070
Hey. I had to get something.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.810
Oh, what did you get there?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.180
Where are you heading?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.550
Me? Oh, I'm just
a bit hungry and

23:40.580 --> 23:42.780
I wanted to get something
to eat really quick.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.820
A little bit of snack maybe.

23:44.850 --> 23:48.090
- Good luck hunting then.
- But wait, wait, wait, wait...

23:48.120 --> 23:51.760
What about drinking some
beers together in your flat?

23:51.790 --> 23:54.830
Because I see always those hot
chicks you bring there and...

23:54.860 --> 23:57.560
you really have
to show me your trick.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.900
No. And if you don't mind.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.770
Oh, sorry.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.740
Thanks.

24:20.950 --> 24:22.090
Hey!

24:22.120 --> 24:23.190
Where have you been?

24:25.660 --> 24:28.060
I was out
with a friend.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.230
With a friend?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.960
Who is it?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.100
You don't know her.

24:36.870 --> 24:37.910
Listen.

24:39.640 --> 24:44.550
I don't want you
to meet any girls, okay?

24:44.580 --> 24:46.750
These girls only
want to screw you.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.050
Nathalie is different.

24:51.120 --> 24:51.950
Nathalie?

24:53.050 --> 24:54.120
Is that her name?

24:55.020 --> 24:56.560
So, she's from here?

24:58.990 --> 24:59.630
See--

25:03.130 --> 25:05.170
I only want the best for you.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.900
These nasty bitches
are all the same.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.670
She's not. You don't
even know her.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.610
Oh, that's right.

25:16.010 --> 25:20.580
And I won't get to know her because
you will stop meeting her, alright?

25:23.320 --> 25:24.250
Hey.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.090
Nobody loves you like I do.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.820
See, I care for you.

25:31.790 --> 25:37.000
I try to protect you every single
day because you're so special to me.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.800
And you know?

25:38.830 --> 25:41.140
I thank you for everything.

26:48.940 --> 26:54.310
You must be thinking,
"Oh my God, why me?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.410
What will he do to me?" Hm?

27:03.250 --> 27:05.050
Well,

27:05.090 --> 27:07.350
there is no God.

27:07.390 --> 27:08.990
And no reason.

27:11.390 --> 27:18.700
The only God you'll ever
meet is me, me, and me.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.140
I'm not lying here.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.980
I'm gonna bleed you out.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.760
You're God

27:41.790 --> 27:43.160
doesn't care.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.960
And I don't fucking care.

27:59.070 --> 28:02.910
No angel's gonna
weep for you tonight.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.900
What do you want?

28:29.940 --> 28:32.270
Oh sorry. Did I--
did I wake you up?

28:32.310 --> 28:33.870
No, what is it?

28:33.910 --> 28:36.840
Do you have hot chicks
here, a visitor?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.980
For the last time,
what do you want?

28:39.010 --> 28:44.450
Okay, listen, I have an important
meeting today so I won't be at home and

28:44.480 --> 28:48.260
I wanted to ask if you could
receive a package for me

28:48.290 --> 28:51.560
and I will invite you
to some beers then for sure--

28:51.590 --> 28:53.890
No time. I'm gonna leave soon.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.930
Okay, that's not cool

28:55.960 --> 28:58.470
but I mean, okay--
maybe next time then.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.030
It's all then?

29:00.070 --> 29:01.100
- Yes.
- Okay.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.100
Can I bring you something?

31:19.240 --> 31:22.980
Sorry, my--my Czech
isn't that good anymore. Um...

31:23.010 --> 31:24.540
One-- one beer, please.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.450
No problem. Sounds good,
I'll bring your beer.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.960
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.160
Yeah?

31:42.200 --> 31:44.300
I haven't seen you here before.

31:44.330 --> 31:47.570
- It's just my second day here.
- Ah, okay.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.040
You're hungry? We have
soup in our daily menu.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.340
What kind of soup?

31:54.370 --> 31:58.380
Potato and noodle soup.

31:58.410 --> 32:02.220
Noodle soup. Uh, I'll take
the noodle soup then.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.150
No problem.
I'll bring it to you.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.430
Here you go.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.630
- Thanks.
- You need more, let me know.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.400
Um, a slice of bread
would be good.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.630
Of course. Sorry.

32:27.410 --> 32:28.340
Here.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.580
Thanks.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.220
You like the soup?

32:44.660 --> 32:46.290
It's delicious.

32:46.330 --> 32:47.190
Fine.

32:49.830 --> 32:54.430
D-D-D-Do you have
some bread... maybe?

32:56.070 --> 32:58.370
Of course I have
some bread for you.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.240
I know that you love that.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.480
So? What do we say?

33:06.410 --> 33:08.580
Th-Thank you, mom.

33:09.550 --> 33:12.290
Come on, I'm just kidding.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.020
You don't have to thank me.

33:15.090 --> 33:18.690
I thank you for being
such a wonderful son.

33:22.760 --> 33:27.300
You haven't made
soup f-f-for a while.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.200
I know.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.670
W-w-why now?

33:36.510 --> 33:37.780
Um...

33:37.810 --> 33:40.580
Because I wanted
to do you a favor.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.550
I-I'm glad that he's gone.

33:48.490 --> 33:51.520
He was not g-good
enough f-f-for you.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.590
No, he wasn't.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.460
And I swear,

33:58.630 --> 34:01.370
nobody will ever
come between us.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.600
<i>And nobody
will ever hurt you.</i>

34:04.740 --> 34:06.110
<i>I promise.</i>

36:01.660 --> 36:02.720
Hey.

36:03.790 --> 36:04.960
Sorry? What?

36:06.690 --> 36:08.360
Do you speak English?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.500
What?

36:09.530 --> 36:11.430
English! Do you speak English?

36:12.400 --> 36:13.270
Yeah.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.970
Oh, okay.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.800
Um...

36:18.470 --> 36:19.470
Are you here alone?

36:21.780 --> 36:22.680
So far.

36:22.710 --> 36:23.740
Sandra!

36:26.350 --> 36:29.250
Sorry, I have to go back
to my friends quick.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.780
Are you still here for a while?

36:30.820 --> 36:31.720
I guess.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.260
Okay perfect!
See you in a minute?

36:37.760 --> 36:38.730
Oh...

36:43.530 --> 36:44.560
Sorry!

36:44.600 --> 36:45.800
It's okay.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.870
- I pay for the cleaning.
- It's okay!

37:15.960 --> 37:18.800
<i>You ungrateful
son of a bitch!</i>

37:20.000 --> 37:21.630
I can't believe it!

37:21.670 --> 37:26.370
It's so disappointing! I just bought you
this new pair of pants and you dirt them?

37:26.410 --> 37:27.770
Get rid of them.

37:31.950 --> 37:32.780
Oh.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.520
Do I feel something? Huh?

37:36.550 --> 37:38.050
Are you enjoying it?

37:38.080 --> 37:39.350
Yeah?

37:39.390 --> 37:40.620
<i>Mom, no!</i>

37:40.650 --> 37:41.720
<i>Mum, no!</i>

38:20.790 --> 38:22.760
Oh, God, shit!

38:22.800 --> 38:23.860
You scared me.

38:25.060 --> 38:26.930
Sorry again about this

38:27.930 --> 38:29.100
accident.

38:30.470 --> 38:33.470
But when you're
already here

38:34.540 --> 38:35.740
I can make amends.

38:52.790 --> 38:53.730
Stop!

38:57.700 --> 39:00.600
Please, don't hurt me.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.900
I'm not going to hurt you.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.570
I'm going to kill you.

39:06.870 --> 39:10.510
Really, really bad.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.530
Enough play-play.

42:59.670 --> 43:02.710
<i>Prague. A brutal
murder announced in Club Starling.</i>

43:02.740 --> 43:05.910
<i>A young woman got killed this night
with several stabs in her back.</i>

43:05.950 --> 43:10.250
<i>Most likely this murder happened on the
dance floor but nobody has seen the deed.</i>

43:10.280 --> 43:14.050
<i>For clarification of facts, the police
needs your help to find the murderer.</i>

43:14.090 --> 43:17.920
<i>The hotline is 420 974 85--</i>

43:25.730 --> 43:27.100
"Needs your help."

44:35.840 --> 44:37.100
"Needs your help."

44:51.050 --> 44:52.420
Oh, what a night.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.460
<i>Oh, do I feel something? Huh?</i>

45:01.490 --> 45:04.830
<i>Are you enjoying it? Yeah?</i>

45:04.860 --> 45:07.130
<i>- You like that?</i>
<i>- No, mom.</i>

45:07.170 --> 45:09.840
<i>I thank you for
being such a wonderful son.</i>

45:10.840 --> 45:12.270
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

45:46.070 --> 45:49.910
Sorry that you had to wait
that long. It's not my day.

45:49.940 --> 45:50.980
No problem.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.980
- You're good?
- Yeah.

45:55.080 --> 45:58.080
Thanks. Um, would you
like something to drink?

45:59.490 --> 46:01.020
Beer, please.

46:01.050 --> 46:02.790
Yeah, I'll bring your
beer in a second.

46:03.490 --> 46:07.290
Wait, would you like
to sit down for a minute?

46:07.330 --> 46:09.460
You look like you need a break.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.530
No, I can't.

46:11.560 --> 46:15.000
You know my car
broke down today and

46:15.030 --> 46:17.840
I had to walk
half of my way here.

46:17.870 --> 46:22.580
So, I was 30 minutes late
and I have no break left.

46:24.210 --> 46:25.140
Okay.

46:26.150 --> 46:27.450
Beer?

46:27.480 --> 46:29.820
Oh! Yeah, I'll bring your beer.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.960
Here.

46:40.990 --> 46:42.960
Um... I would like to pay now.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.860
- Why leave so soon?
- Gotta go.

46:46.530 --> 46:48.470
Uh, 30 Koruna.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.640
It's okay.

46:49.670 --> 46:50.970
Oh, thank you.

56:37.090 --> 56:38.990
It's not a lot
of business today.

56:40.490 --> 56:41.130
No.

56:42.030 --> 56:43.100
Not really.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.030
I think it's worse
than the last time.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.700
Some of the guys say that
some will lose their jobs.

56:53.140 --> 56:54.840
We'll see who it will be.

56:57.940 --> 57:01.080
Don't get me wrong but it seems
like you talk less than before.

57:01.110 --> 57:04.020
I mean you have never
been the talky one

57:04.050 --> 57:06.690
but in the last time
you're more quiet than before.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.120
Is everything okay?

57:09.520 --> 57:11.590
Yeah, everything okay.

57:11.620 --> 57:16.160
I mean, it's crazy to ask you that,
I don't even know your fucking name.

57:19.030 --> 57:22.130
If you like to talk bro,
you can talk to every time.

57:29.210 --> 57:30.980
Oh no.

57:31.010 --> 57:33.150
Please don't come to our place.

57:40.720 --> 57:41.650
I knew it.

57:43.220 --> 57:44.960
Fucking bitch.

58:49.090 --> 58:51.290
It took even longer
than the last time.

58:52.190 --> 58:56.830
I hope there's no scratch on my
expensive car paint this time.

59:23.390 --> 59:24.290
God.

59:24.320 --> 59:28.090
If I could, I would kill
the fucking cunt.

59:31.900 --> 59:33.600
I know how you feel.

59:40.840 --> 59:42.410
No!

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.300
What the fuck?

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.930
Sorry I was there and your
front door was not locked

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.270
and I heard some loud noises
and a crack and I don't know.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.520
Fuck.

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:41.820
Fuck!

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.490
Fuck!

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:59.270
You've been out for quite a
while. Where have you been?

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:05.180
Uh, I wanted to meet
Nathalie but she didn't show up.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:11.180
This bitch, Nathalie,
won't hurt you again.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.390
What? What have you done?

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.590
I just took care about
that little piece of shit.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.360
What have you done?

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.430
Watch your tongue.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.130
One last time!

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:28.900
I just ensured

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:32.640
that she will never ever
get close to you again!

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:37.580
And then I buried her
in our garden.

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.980
No!

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.230
No...

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.030
No.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.120
Hey darling.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.560
I will make us some tea
and then we can watch some TV?

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.370
Darling, honey--

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.520
Good evening to you,
you hot bitch!

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:06.120
Oh, I know some nice things we
could do with that finger, baby.

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:10.520
Here, sit down.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:11.620
Thanks.

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:19.560
Um...

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:22.160
Do you like something
to drink?

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.430
A tea?

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.270
Tea. Of course.
I'll be back in a minute.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.460
Careful. It's hot.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:01.930
Thank you so much.

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:12.240
For God's sake.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:13.680
Why have you been there?

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:17.620
God, I was--

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:20.450
Why have you even been there?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:24.260
Well, I was walking home
and I live near.

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.920
Was around.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.660
Fuck!

01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:30.399
Could you see who it was?

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:35.430
No, sorry. It was too dark.
Didn't see anything.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.370
Sure it was one of these disgusting
guys from my work who always harass me.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:44.779
Um.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:47.680
Why do you even work there?

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:51.479
I mean you can find
a better job anytime.

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:55.290
No, it's not that easy.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.220
I'm lucky to have
a job, you know.

01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:08.800
It wasn't always that bad.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.810
I had a husband.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.350
And I was also pregnant.

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:30.990
We had a nice house in a good
neighborhood here in Praha.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.960
And somehow...

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.360
...I lost everything.

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.900
I was so broken after that

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:45.870
that I wanted to kill
myself a few times.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.920
But now, I try to get along
with life and everything.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.460
I have a little apartment.
Not as big as yours but

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.590
it's okay.

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:12.360
Somehow.

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.800
It's okay now.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.520
Sorry. I don't know
why I told you all that.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.590
It's okay.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.920
Sometimes it's good
to let it all out.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.660
As far as I heard.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.600
What's your story, by the way?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.800
You don't look
like you're from here.

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:53.570
My-- my father
was from Prague and

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:58.080
my mother from-from the UK.

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:03.680
I was born in England. Um.

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.920
Lived here till I was nineteen.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.990
Then both were gone.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.890
I've had to move several times.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.760
I lived in Canada for a while.

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:16.790
Australia.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.870
But now I'm here
in Prague, for now.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:25.700
Back.

01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:30.710
Sounds busy and sad.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.980
It's okay.

01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:37.950
It seems you've seen and
experienced a lot in your life too.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.420
And you look
a little bit tired also.

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.090
Aren't we all?

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.520
Maybe true.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.530
But sorry to hear that.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.690
It's okay. Like I've said,

01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.000
I get along like everybody else.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.030
Gotta do what you gotta do.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.170
What's your name, by the way?

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.510
Xavier.

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:10.780
I'm Karolina.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:16.590
I know. Um, excuse me
for a moment.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.520
Yeah.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.820
I'm sorry. I don't want
to spy on you.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.520
I was just curious. Bad habit.

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.800
Is that me?

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.000
It's really cool.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:14.910
Um...

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.880
You can have it
if you want, it's yours.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:21.990
Thanks.

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.860
It will get a special place.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.130
Uh...

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:38.040
Thank you.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.110
Thank you
for everything.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.700
Thank you.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.740
Thank you for everything.

01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:32.480
Thank you for everything.

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:34.880
Thank you for everything.

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:36.480
I thank you for everything.

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:37.750
Yeah?

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.920
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:14.890
Sorry.

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:27.870
<i>Thank you for everything.
Thank you for everything.</i>

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.000
<i>Such a wonderful son.</i>

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.940
<i>I thank you for everything.</i>

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.130
From now on,

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:47.500
I'll take over.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.980
<i>Darling, honey--</i>
