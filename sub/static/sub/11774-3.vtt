WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:06.607
( theme music playing )

00:11.445 --> 00:14.548
SO LORETTA WAS SWEARING
AT YOU AND YELLING AT YOU?

00:14.648 --> 00:17.518
- ( laughs ) YEAH.
- AND SHE REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE CHEATING ON HER?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.454
AUNTIE RAE GAVE ME--
SHE GAVE ME THE FINGER

00:20.554 --> 00:22.256
- AS SHE WAS
DRIVING AWAY. YEAH.
- DID SHE REALLY?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.058
- OH GOD.
- "FUCK YOU, LARRY."

00:24.158 --> 00:25.926
HOW'S IT FEEL
LIVING ALONE?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.662
WELL, I'M NOT ALONE.
I'VE STILL GOT LEON.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.398
UMM, LISTEN.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.134
I KNOW I BROUGHT IT UP
A MILLION TIMES,

00:33.234 --> 00:37.105
BUT NBC IS STILL
HARPING ME ABOUT

00:37.205 --> 00:39.039
ABOUT DOING
A "SEINFELD" REUNION.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.675
AGAIN? DON'T THEY
GIVE UP, THESE PEOPLE?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.444
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:43.544 --> 00:46.680
YOU KNOW,
THOSE REUNION SHOWS,
THEY'RE SO LAME, REALLY.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.917
THEY NEVER WORK.
THE ACTORS ARE
10 YEARS OLDER.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.852
IT JUST
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.488
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO.
AND JERRY WOULD NEVER WANT
TO DO IT, EITHER.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.624
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU

00:56.724 --> 00:58.392
BUT HERE'S
WHAT I NEED, OKAY?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.961
COME WITH ME TO NBC--
LET ME SET UP A MEETING--

01:01.061 --> 01:03.264
SAY NO. THAT WAY
I CAN ALWAYS SAY TO THEM,

01:03.364 --> 01:05.466
"HE SAID NO.
YOU HEARD IT FROM HIM."

01:05.566 --> 01:07.668
- FINE.
- THANK YOU.
THEY'LL LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.338
WE MOVE ON
TO OTHER THINGS.
NONE OF THIS CRAP.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.407
- HI, HONEY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- HI. OH, THE SAME.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.643
- I'M SORRY.
- REALLY NOT GOOD.
HI, LAR.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.113
- HEY. WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I-- YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.615
I'M ACHY--
MY KNEES ACHE.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.185
I FEEL WEAK.
I'VE BEEN TO TWO DOCTORS--

01:24.285 --> 01:26.554
EVERYBODY SAYS I'M FINE.
IT'S IN MY HEAD,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.790
WHICH IS BULLSHIT.
AS YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS
HAPPY AND UP.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.592
YOU ARE
A PICTURE OF HAPPINESS.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.627
- SHE DOES HAVE
A VERY GOOD DISPOSITION.
- Jeff: SHE'S BUBBLY.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.963
- WOULDN'T YOU
SAY THAT? BUBBLY.
- Larry: YEAH, I THINK SO.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.366
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO TIRED.
IT'S JUST LIKE--

01:38.466 --> 01:40.768
HAVE YOU BEEN IN
ANY TALL GRASS LATELY?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.272
WELL, YOU KNOW,
ON FIRE ISLAND
I WAS IN TALL GRASS.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.174
I WAS ON THE DUNES,
IN THE GRASS WHEN
WE WERE THERE.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.041
HAVE YOU BEEN TESTED
FOR LYME DISEASE?

01:48.142 --> 01:50.043
YOU THINK IT'S
A TICK BITE OR SOMETHING?

01:50.144 --> 01:53.347
IT COULD BE. I KNOW
SOMEBODY WHO HAD SOMETHING,
IT WASN'T DIAGNOSED

01:53.447 --> 01:55.048
AND THEN IT TURNED OUT
TO BE LYME DISEASE.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.984
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?
TAKE A BLOOD TEST.

01:57.084 --> 02:00.020
WHAT ARE YOU,
A FUCKING DOCTOR?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS?

02:00.120 --> 02:03.457
( chuckles )
I'M A HYPOCHONDRIAC,
SO I'M AWARE OF THIS STUFF.

02:15.369 --> 02:19.273
( laughs )
OH MY GOD.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.509
- WHAT IS THIS?
- Cheryl: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.644
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME

02:23.744 --> 02:26.247
I'VE RUN INTO YOU IN,
WHAT, THREE WEEKS?

02:26.347 --> 02:28.416
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I HAD AN AUDITION.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.552
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I'M ACTING AGAIN.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.722
- WOW. HOW'D YOU DO?
- I DID OKAY.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.657
- YEAH.
- I DON'T THINK I GOT IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.792
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.828
I HAVE A MEETING

02:40.928 --> 02:44.232
WITH JEFF AND NBC ABOUT
A "SEINFELD" REUNION,

02:44.332 --> 02:45.733
- BUT IT'S--
- REALLY?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.835
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.604
- I'M JUST GOING--
- NO, THAT'S PERFECT.
PEOPLE LOVE REUNION SHOWS.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.673
HOW MUCH WOULD PEOPLE
LOVE TO SEE THAT CAST
BACK TOGETHER?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.709
SEE WHAT THEY'RE
DOING NOW, YEARS LATER,
AND HOW THEY LOOK?

02:55.809 --> 02:58.446
- SO YOU'D BE
RUNNING-- RUNNING IT.
- YEAH, I'D BE WRITING IT.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.648
- YEAH, WHAT I
USED TO DO. YEAH.
- WRITING IT AND--

03:00.748 --> 03:03.617
MY GOD. YOU HAVE TO
WRITE A PART FOR ME.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.354
- OH HO, YOU'VE GOT IT.
- OKAY. I'M NOT KIDDING.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.955
- YEAH.
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.857
- YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.
OKAY, FINE.
- NO, I'M NOT.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.261
- WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?
- OH, I'M JUST--
I'M DOING PILATES,

03:13.361 --> 03:16.063
I'M LEARNING JAPANESE
AND I'M INTO THE LAKERS.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.699
- I AM FINALLY APPRECIATING--
- NOW YOU'RE INTO BASKETBALL?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.901
- AFTER I LEAVE?
- BUT NOW I'VE GOT SOME
GIRLFRIENDS THAT ARE--

03:21.001 --> 03:23.771
THEY ARE INTO IT
AND WE'RE GOING
ON THURSDAY NIGHT,

03:23.871 --> 03:26.073
- GOING TO THE GAME.
- REALLY? I WAS
ACTUALLY THINKING

03:26.173 --> 03:27.675
ABOUT GOING TO
THAT GAME. I WAS GONNA
BUY SCALPER'S TICKETS.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.710
- OH.
- MAYBE I'LL RUN INTO YOU.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.280
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU?
- WHY WOULDN'T I? YEAH.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.383
- I SHOULD RUN.
- OKAY.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.850
- BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.986
- REALLY. BYE.
- BYE.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.632
- WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?
- SHE'S-- SHE'S ACTING AGAIN.
SHE HAD AN AUDITION.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.401
OH. GOOD FOR HER.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.604
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS BULLSHIT OVER WITH.
- OKAY.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
Sandy:
LARRY, I'M GOING TO
ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION

03:58.606 --> 04:00.741
THAT EVERY
AFFILIATE ASKS ME

04:00.841 --> 04:02.676
( chuckles )
EVERY DAY OF MY JOB--

04:02.776 --> 04:05.346
IS "WHEN ARE WE GOING TO
GET A 'SEINFELD' REUNION?"

04:05.446 --> 04:07.281
- MM-HMM.
- HUH?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.783
- YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.
- HUH?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.686
WELL, THE WINDOW IS
WIDE OPEN RIGHT NOW
AND IT'S KIND OF PERFECT.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.656
- Jeff: WELL,
LISTENING TO YOU...
- MM-HMM.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.258
- ...HAS ME EXCITED.
- WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
I'M EXCITED!

04:18.359 --> 04:20.294
- ( execs chuckles )
- Jeff: I THINK THAT--

04:20.394 --> 04:22.095
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
HOUR, HALF HOUR?

04:22.195 --> 04:23.664
I AM THINKING
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
DO YOU WANT TO DO AN HOUR?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.635
DO YOU WANT
TO DO A HALF HOUR?
WE DON'T CARE.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.604
IT'S THE FINEST COMMODITY
NBC HAS PUT OUT...

04:32.340 --> 04:34.007
I REALLY LIKE WHAT
YOU DID IN THAT TAKE.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.877
REALLY? 'CAUSE I CAN
TRY IT DIFFERENT WAY
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.180
- I CAN--
- NO, DON'T CHANGE
A THING. IT'S PERFECT.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.583
AND AS FAR
AS THE REST OF YOU GO,

04:42.683 --> 04:44.418
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF LITTLE THINGS.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.454
- UH, MICHAEL?
- YEAH.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.323
I LOVED THE ENTRANCE.
THAT SLIDE? IT'S WORKING.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.325
WELL, IT'S MAKING ME
A BIT DIZZY,

04:51.425 --> 04:53.293
BUT I'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU, LARRY.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.062
JULIA, THE BUSINESS
WITH THE APPLE--

04:55.162 --> 04:56.630
COME ON,
HOW FUNNY IS THAT?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.166
HEY, IT WAS YOUR IDEA
AND IT COMPLETELY WORKS.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.535
THE GLASSES?
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.904
I CAN'T DO IT AS GOOD AS YOU,
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.

05:04.004 --> 05:07.174
YEAH, AND THAT NEW LINE--
THE KUMQUAT AND THE QUAIL?

05:07.274 --> 05:09.777
- YOU'RE AMAZING.
- YEAH, AMAZING.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.846
- Jerry and Julia: AMAZING.
- YEAH, YOU'RE REALLY
UNBELIEVABLE, LARRY.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.150
Man:
WE ARE THINKING TO LEAVE
THE DOOR OPEN TO THE CREATIVE--

05:17.250 --> 05:18.919
- I'LL-- I'LL DO IT.
- WHAT?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.220
- I'LL DO IT.
- YOU'LL DO IT?!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.089
- Execs: THAT IS AMAZING.
- REALLY?

05:22.189 --> 05:24.358
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- WOW.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.893
- YOU'RE GONNA DO IT?
- I'M GONNA DO IT.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.161
AND I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
FOR GEORGE TOO.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.499
- HE'S ALREADY WRITING.
- IN THE 11 YEARS SINCE
THE SHOW'S BEEN OFF THE AIR,

05:31.599 --> 05:33.801
HE'S GOTTEN
MARRIED, DIVORCED

05:33.901 --> 05:35.736
AND NOW HE'S GONNA TRY
TO GET HIS WIFE BACK.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.471
- FUNNY.
- OKAY.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.473
I KNOW IT'S
NOT A GREAT IDEA,
BUT I CAN WORK ON IT.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.709
- NO, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
- I LOVE THIS.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.645
- WHAT ABOUT JERRY?
- I'LL TALK TO JERRY
AND I'LL TALK TO THE CAST.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.380
- GREAT. GREAT.
- Woman: GREAT.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.948
- Man Â£2: AWESOME.
- WE NEED TO CELEBRATE.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.183
- Woman: WE DO, YES.
- YOU LIKE BASKETBALL?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.620
- OF COURSE.
- DO I LIKE BASKETBALL?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
- HE LOVES BASKETBALL.
- DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO A LAKER'S GAME?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.790
WE WERE GONNA TRY
TO GO THURSDAY NIGHT.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.926
- YEAH, WE WERE GONNA
GET SCALPER'S TICKETS.
- NO NEED. NO NEED.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.396
- WE WILL HOOK YOU UP.
YES, I WILL HOOK YOU UP.
- NO KIDDING?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.031
- WOW.
- DON'T YOU EVEN
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.166
YOU SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT THIS IDEA UP
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.368
- ( all laugh )
- THANKS.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.471
- THIS IS EXCITING.
- OKAY.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.742
GOTTA CALL JERRY.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.144
- OH!
- MAYBE I'LL DO THAT
IN THE CAR.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.146
YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'VE GOT TO CALL?

06:19.246 --> 06:22.115
CHERYL, TO TELL HER
THAT SHE'S GONNA BE

06:22.215 --> 06:24.452
IN A "SEINFELD"
REUNION SHOW.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.254
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.
YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.256
WE'RE SITTING UP THERE,
YOU SAY I'LL DO IT

06:29.356 --> 06:30.924
AND I'M GOING
"REALLY? YOU'LL DO IT?"

06:31.024 --> 06:33.326
AND LITERALLY, IT HIT ME
THE SECOND WE WALKED OUT
OF THAT MEETING.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.029
IT'S LIKE "OH!
THIS IS YOUR PLAN

06:36.129 --> 06:37.598
TO GET
YOUR EX-WIFE BACK."

06:37.698 --> 06:41.401
PRETTY FUCKING BRILLIANT
IF YOU ASK ME.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.070
WELL, I MEAN,
THINK OF IT THIS WAY:

06:43.170 --> 06:46.306
I'M GONNA--
I'LL BE WITH HER
EVERY DAY ON THE SET,

06:46.406 --> 06:48.576
DIRECTING HER,
WORKING WITH HER.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.645
- SHE'LL SEE ME
IN THIS WHOLE NEW LIGHT.
- AS A WORKING MAN.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.614
AND ALREADY SHE STARTED
LOOKING AT ME DIFFERENTLY

06:53.714 --> 06:55.516
- WHEN I TOLD HER I WAS
GOING FOR THE MEETING.
- I KNOW.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.018
THIS IS GREAT.
AND I'M A HERO
NOW WITH NBC.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.221
SO I'M ALL FOR IT.
I'M GONNA BACK YOU
ON THIS THE WHOLE WAY.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.756
PRETTY BRILLIANT.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.593
- ( phone rings )
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.862
I'VE GOT THIS REALLY GOOD
IDEA FOR GEORGE.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.065
HE'S GOTTEN
MARRIED, DIVORCED

07:12.165 --> 07:14.034
AND NOW HE'S TRYING
TO GET HIS EX-WIFE BACK.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.103
- I THINK THAT
COULD BE FUNNY.
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT BAD.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.371
BUT ANYWAY,
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE
OF IDEAS.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.274
BUT WHY WOULD WE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

07:21.374 --> 07:25.278
I MEAN, I REMEMBER
YOU TALKING ABOUT--

07:25.378 --> 07:27.147
WHENEVER A SITCOM
DOES A REUNION EPISODE

07:27.247 --> 07:28.949
YOU SAY,
"ISN'T IT PATHETIC?"

07:29.049 --> 07:31.318
- I SAID PATHETIC?
- DESPERATE, PATHETIC.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.087
- DESPERATE?
- WHEN WE WOULD WATCH SHOWS--
OTHER SHOWS--

07:34.187 --> 07:35.523
WE'D SEE THEM DO
REUNION SHOWS,

07:35.623 --> 07:37.525
YOU WOULD LOOK
AND YOU'D MAKE THAT FACE--

07:37.625 --> 07:40.327
YOU KNOW, THAT VERY
JUDGMENTAL FACE OF YOURS...

07:40.427 --> 07:42.563
- I DID?
- ...WHERE YOU SEE PEOPLE

07:42.663 --> 07:44.798
WHO DO NOT HAVE
YOUR AESTHETIC STANDARDS.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.134
YOU CRITICIZE
AND DOWNGRADE THEM FOR IT.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.236
THAT'S YOUR STYLE.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.371
- CRITICIZING
AND DOWNGRADING?
- YES.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.206
WHAT'S NOT QUITE
CLEAR TO ME

07:53.306 --> 07:55.676
IS HOW YOU SEEM
TO HAVE SHIFTED

07:55.776 --> 07:58.979
YOUR WHOLE ATTITUDE
ABOUT THESE SHOWS.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.614
- I HAVEN'T SHIFTED.
- NO, YOU'VE SHIFTED.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.015
- NO, THERE'S NO SHIFT.
- THERE'S A SHIFT.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.685
- NO SHIFT.
- I'M BEING SOLD SOMETHING HERE

08:04.785 --> 08:07.287
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I GET THAT FUNNY FEELING,

08:07.387 --> 08:09.022
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE
IN A CAR SHOWROOM

08:09.122 --> 08:12.259
AND THE GUY IS
JUST TRYING TO CLOSE
THAT DEAL ON THE CAR.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.495
IT-- IT'S JUST WEIRD
TO ME THAT YOU SUDDENLY
LIKE AN IDEA

08:15.596 --> 08:17.698
THAT YOU ALWAYS
ALWAYS HATED.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.433
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'D JUST BE FUN
TO GET TOGETHER.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.869
GET TOGETHER?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.004
YOU'RE NOT
A GET-TOGETHER GUY.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.373
YOU DON'T LIKE
TO GET TOGETHER.
YOU HATE TO GET TOGETHER.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.308
WE COULD HAVE A DINNER.
WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE
A NICE DINNER?

08:28.408 --> 08:31.178
I JUST THINK THAT
EVERYBODY WANTS IT.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.147
WHY ARE WE DEPRIVING
THEM OF THIS? IT'S CRAZY.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.983
I KNOW, BUT IT'S
LIKE YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO AN OLD GIRLFRIEND

08:36.083 --> 08:38.218
AND SAYING
"HEY, MAYBE I CAN
MAKE IT WORK NOW,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.053
10 YEARS LATER."

08:40.153 --> 08:42.756
DOES THAT EVER WORK
IN ANY RELATIONSHIP
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.492
ROBERT WAGNER
AND NATALIE WOOD.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

08:45.593 --> 08:47.628
THEY GOT DIVORCED
AND THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.163
AND THEN SHE SLIPPED
OFF THE BOAT AND DIED.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.166
- SO HOW DID THAT WORK OUT?
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.803
AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN?
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

08:55.903 --> 08:58.305
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE WAS DOING ON THE BOAT.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.344
JUST TELL ME--
WHY ISN'T IT LAME?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.279
WHY ISN'T--
ISN'T IT LAME?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.817
BECAUSE WE'LL
DO IT IN A WAY
THAT WON'T BE LAME.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.454
- WE WILL.
- YEAH. I CAN'T
ARGUE WITH THAT.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.523
- LET ME TALK
TO THE OTHERS.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.759
IF I GET THE OTHERS,
WILL YOU GO ALONG WITH IT?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.661
I GUESS
I WOULD, YEAH.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.830
- REALLY?
- I TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.232
- I TRUST YOU.
- I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S GONNA BE FUNNY.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.668
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT STORY
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT-- HOW
GEORGE WOULD HAVE AN EX-WIFE?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.037
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW WHO'D BE GREAT
FOR THAT IS MEG RYAN.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.739
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.540
- YES, MEG RYAN.
- MEG RYAN?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.375
- I--
- I SAW HER IN THIS THING
THE OTHER NIGHT.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.745
SHE GOT UP AND TALKED,
SHE LOOKS GREAT.

09:37.845 --> 09:41.214
- SHE'S FUNNY. SHE'S GREAT.
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE'D
RATHER GO WITH AN UNKNOWN.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.651
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CASTING WILL TAKE
CARE OF ITSELF.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.018
- YEAH. IT WILL.
- WE'LL, YOU KNOW--

09:45.118 --> 09:46.787
- IT WILL.
LET'S DO IT.
- FANTASTIC.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.421
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.223
- I'M GONNA TALK
TO THE OTHERS.
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.159
OKAY.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.997
THE BIG THING FOR GEORGE IS
THE EX-WIFE WHO LEFT HIM...

09:57.097 --> 09:59.266
- YES.
- ...AND HE WANTS
TO GET HER BACK.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.770
NO ONE'S GONNA BUY IT.
THE CHARACTER IS UNLOVABLE.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.306
HE IS A-- YOU KNOW,
HE'S A JERKY, SCHMUCKY
LITTLE CHARACTER.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.841
ALL RIGHT?
HE'S JUST A BUFFOON.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.911
HE'S SO UNAPPEALING
THAT TO BUY THAT THERE
WAS A MARRIAGE

10:11.011 --> 10:12.612
- THAT'S SUSTAINED AT ALL--
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.915
WHY IS HE UNAPPEALING?
PEOPLE LOVED THE CHARACTER.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.284
BECAUSE HE'S SELFISH,
HE'S STUPID, HE LIES...

10:17.384 --> 10:19.653
- YEAH, BUT PEOPLE--
HE'S NOT STUPID.
- ...HE'S ABRASIVE, HE'S INEPT.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.723
- HE'S FUNNY. EVERYTHING YOU
JUST SAID IS FUNNY.
- YEAH, IT'S FUNNY.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.792
- OKAY, SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY--
- IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE EVERYBODY
LAUGHS AT HIM,

10:24.892 --> 10:26.526
'CAUSE WE ALL KNOW
SCHMUCKS LIKE THAT.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.130
BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT--
HERE'S THE UPSIDE
TO IT, REALLY--

10:30.230 --> 10:32.666
IT COULD MAKE UP
FOR THE FINALE.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.267
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
"MAKE UP FOR THE FIN"--

10:34.367 --> 10:35.703
THERE'S NOTHING
TO MAKE UP FOR.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.238
IT REALLY LETS US END
"SEINFELD" ON A GOOD NOTE.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.141
IT COULD BE A "WE KNOW.
WE KNOW. WE'RE SORRY."

10:41.241 --> 10:42.743
ON THAT LEVEL I LIKE IT.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.746
AND, CREATIVELY, IT MAKES ME--
MY JUICES ARE GOING.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.949
- MY JUICE IS GOING.
- WAIT. WHAT--

10:49.049 --> 10:51.251
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THIS RESTAURANT?

10:51.351 --> 10:52.820
- OH, THE PHOTOS?
- YEAH.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.487
BOY, THOSE ARE
DISTRACTING, HUH?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.489
- BUT ANYWAY,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
- AND JULIA--

10:56.589 --> 10:57.858
EVERYBODY IS
DOWN FOR THIS?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.292
I MEAN, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO JULIA ABOUT THIS?

10:59.392 --> 11:02.262
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET
WITH HER TODAY...
- YEAH?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.231
...BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD
TO DRIVE HER DAUGHTER
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.099
AND SHE KINDA BLEW ME OFF,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.002
BUT I'M GONNA MEET
WITH HER TOMORROW.
JERRY'LL DO IT IF YOU DO IT.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.371
- AND MICHAEL-- YES?
- I HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO HIM YET,

11:11.471 --> 11:13.006
BUT I'M GONNA MEET
WITH EVERYBODY.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.143
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S DO IT.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.677
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S DO IT.
I'M EXCITED.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.612
- GREAT.
- THIS IS GONNA WORK.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.949
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.952
FOR GEORGE'S EX-WIFE,
IF WE GET ONE OF THESE
GREAT ACTRESSES

11:25.052 --> 11:26.519
THAT HAS THE LITTLE BIT
OF THE FUNNY VOICE--

11:26.619 --> 11:30.357
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A JENNIFER TILLY,
LIKE A KRISTIN CHENOWETH.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.993
YOU DON'T NEED TO CONCERN
YOURSELF SO MUCH WITH WHO'S
PLAYING GEORGE'S WIFE.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.928
- IT'S NOT
CONCERN. I'M EXCITED.
- NEXT THING I KNOW,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.596
YOU'RE GONNA BE--
WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
BE WRITING WITH ME.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.531
- YOU NEED SOME IDEAS?
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.500
- 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THERE WERE A FEW THINGS...
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.636
- ...THAT I PITCHED OVER
THE YEARS YOU DIDN'T--
- YEAH, WHATEVER.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.538
- THEY WEREN'T THAT GREAT.
- AND IT'S NICE.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.174
- WE'LL GO OUT ON
A GOOD NOTE THIS TIME.
- WE'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.475
WE WENT OUT--
WE ALREADY WENT OUT ON A--

11:48.575 --> 11:49.977
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.611
- AH YES, THANK YOU.
- I HOPE EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.380
- IT WAS FANTASTIC.
- WE DON'T NEED TO GO OUT
ON A GOOD NOTE.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.949
- WE WENT OUT ON A GOOD NOTE.
- AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.285
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE?
LET'S COORDINATE THE TIP HERE.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.855
- WHY?
- WELL, WHEN WE SPLIT
THE CHECK,

12:01.955 --> 12:03.991
WE BOTH HAVE
THE EXACT SAME BILL.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.860
SO WHY DON'T WE LEAVE
THE SAME THING SO ONE OF US
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.096
WHAT, ARE WE FAVORED NATIONS
ALL OF A SUDDEN FOR LUNCH?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.398
NO, BUT WHAT IS
THE BIG DEAL IF WE BOTH
LEAVE THE SAME AMOUNT?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.833
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE?
WHAT'S YOUR INCLINATION?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.467
- $12.
- $12?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.137
- YEAH.
- GOOD. PUT DOWN $12.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.306
- WRITE-- WRITE $12 DOWN.
- HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE?

12:21.141 --> 12:24.477
- MM-HMM. MMM. MMM.
- WHAT'S YOUR PLAN HERE?

12:24.577 --> 12:28.415
I'M ENCOURAGING YOU
TO LEAVE $12.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.319
I THINK IT'S A NUMBER.
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE
ASHAMED OF

12:32.419 --> 12:36.990
IN WRITING $12
UNDER "GRATUITY"
ON YOUR CHECK.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.559
ARE YOU GONNA
LEAVE $12?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.061
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M LEAVING?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.729
I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN
WHAT I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.098
I'M WRITING A NUMBER.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.067
NOW I'M FOLDING
THAT NUMBER

12:47.167 --> 12:50.737
AND I'M PUTTING
IT INSIDE MY LITTLE
LEATHER CHECK HOLDER.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.040
WAITER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.342
- NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU.
- YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.811
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL ME WHAT YOU LEFT?
IS THAT IT?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.880
I AM VERY EXCITED
ABOUT OUR SHOW.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.415
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN TIP COORDINATION,
IS THAT IT?

13:02.515 --> 13:05.152
LET'S STAY
IN TOUCH ABOUT THE GIRL.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.854
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF IDEAS.
I'LL EMAIL YOU.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.790
THIS IS EXCITING, LARRY.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.625
Larry: AND SOME
FUNNY IDEAS FOR ELAINE.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.361
- OH, REALLY?
LIKE WHAT?
- YEAH.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.864
A LITTLE GIRL ASKS YOU
TO GIVE HER DOLL A HAIRCUT.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.365
- MM-HMM.
- YOU GIVE HER
THE HAIRCUT,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.001
SHE FINDS OUT
IT DOESN'T GROW BACK
AND SHE FREAKS OUT.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.537
- YEAH, ELAINE AROUND A KID.
- AROUND THE KID AND HER
MOTHER YELLING AT HER.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.007
- SO THAT COULD BE FUNNY.
- UH-HUH, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.810
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
LARRY, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A REUNION SHOW

13:30.911 --> 13:33.346
- THAT WAS NOT TACKY.
- YEAH, I--

13:33.446 --> 13:35.883
I MEAN, EVERY TIME
YOU SEE ONE OF THESE
REUNION SHOWS,

13:35.983 --> 13:37.817
IT FEELS LIKE
THEY'RE DOING IT
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.453
- REALLY?
- HEY, IS JERRY INTO IT?

13:40.553 --> 13:43.156
COMPLETELY INTO IT.
HE'S CHOMPING AT THE BIT.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.192
- REALLY?
- IS IT CHOMPING
OR CHAMPING?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.327
I THINK
IT'S CHOMP-- CHAMPING?
WHAT IS CHAMPING?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.629
I THINK
IT'S SPELLED "CHAMPING"
BUT PRONOUNCED "CHOMPING."

13:49.729 --> 13:53.033
NO, IT'S SPELLED
"CHOMPING" AND IT'S
PRONOUNCED "CHOMPING."

13:53.133 --> 13:55.202
- NOT SO SURE.
- I'M SO SURE.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.938
- REALLY? HMM.
- YEAH. CHOMP.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.673
WELL, REGARDLESS,
JASON-- INTO IT,

14:00.773 --> 14:03.143
- WANTS TO DO IT.
- OH MY GOD.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.145
- I--
- COME ON,
LET'S DO IT.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.547
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE--
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.549
- I'M INTO IT.
- FANTASTIC.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.319
- ( phone ringing )
- I'VE GOT TO GO GET THIS.
BE RIGHT BACK.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.521
- CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING TO DRINK?
- NO THANKS, I'M GOOD.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.190
- ARE YOU SURE? OKAY.
- YEAH.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.927
- HEY!
- HEY.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.929
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- IT'S GOOD.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.397
HOW WAS THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
THE OTHER DAY?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.333
WHAT BIRTHDAY PARTY?

14:26.433 --> 14:29.903
YOU KNOW, YOU WENT
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.072
NO, I DIDN'T GO
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.607
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.709
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOUR MOTHER SAID.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.312
I DIDN'T GO
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.914
HUH.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.283
INTERESTING.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.925
Larry:
I'VE GOT SOME REALLY
GOOD IDEAS FOR KRAMER.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.493
THIS ONE IDEA THAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME--

14:53.593 --> 14:56.163
I PICKED UP
A HOOKER SO I COULD
USE THE CARPOOL LANE

14:56.263 --> 14:58.698
TO GET TO DODGER STADIUM
'CAUSE I WAS LATE
FOR A BALLGAME.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.468
THAT HAPPENED TO ME.
I'VE SPOKEN TO JASON,
HE WANTS TO DO IT.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.171
JERRY WILL DO IT.
I JUST TALKED TO JULIA,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.805
SHE'S IN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.008
HUH?
DO YOU LIKE THAT IDEA?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.842
- HUH?
- YEAH. MMM.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.878
- GOOD IDEA, RIGHT?
- OH, YEAH.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.681
I MEAN, AM I CRAZY?
TELL ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:14.781 --> 15:15.815
- HMM?
- YEAH.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.085
- AM I CRAZY?
- HMM?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.787
AM I CRAZY?
DO YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.722
I DON'T KNOW.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.691
OKAY, I'M GLAD
YOU SAID THAT.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.759
I'M GLAD YOU THINK
I'M CRAZY. THAT MEANS
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.896
IF YOU THINK
IT'S A CRAZY IDEA,
THEN IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.164
IF YOU SAID,
"NO, YOU'RE NOT CRAZY,"

15:31.264 --> 15:33.066
THEN I'D THINK
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.468
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?
- YEAH.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.537
- HUH? YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?
- DEFINITELY. SURE.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.606
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- YEAH. WHAT?

15:39.706 --> 15:41.808
- LET'S DO IT.
- DO IT?

15:41.908 --> 15:44.177
COME ON, LET'S DO IT.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.945
- LET'S DO IT.
- WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE?

15:46.046 --> 15:48.381
- 2:12.
- ( sighs )

15:48.481 --> 15:50.217
I'M SORRY. I'VE GOT
TO PICK UP BETH.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.353
OH, OKAY.
I'VE GOT THE CHECK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.022
- YOU CAN GET THIS? JUST A TEA.
- OF COURSE. YEAH, COME ON.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.623
- YOU HAD A TEA. COME ON.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.591
- THIS IS EXCITING.
ARE YOU EXCITED?
- YEAH.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.660
- HUH? IT'S EXCITING.
- YEAH YEAH. IT WAS
GOOD SEEING YOU.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.462
- IT'S EXCITING, RIGHT?
- I'VE GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.364
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.
I'M EXCITED.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.899
- HOW ARE WE DOING
OVER HERE, SIR?
- DOING GOOD.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.635
- GOOD GOOD.
- DOING GOOD.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.471
- ANYTHING I CAN GET YOU?
- NO. I HAVE A QUESTION
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.306
- OKAY.
- YOU REMEMBER I WAS
SITTING HERE YESTERDAY?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.875
- YEAH.
- WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME

16:15.975 --> 16:18.145
HOW MUCH TIP THE GUY
I WAS WITH LEFT YOU?

16:18.245 --> 16:22.115
OH. ( chuckles )
WE DON'T DO THAT.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.851
- YOU DON'T DO WHAT?
- WE DON'T SHARE

16:24.951 --> 16:27.020
- THAT INFORMATION
WITH CUSTOMERS.
- HUH, "SHARE INFORMATION"?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.022
HONESTLY,
WHO GIVES A CRAP?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.191
I WAS IN HERE.
I WAS WITH A GUY.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.992
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
WHAT DID HE LEAVE?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.763
IT WAS A HEALTHY--
HEALTHY TIP.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.500
- WAS MINE
A HEALTHY TIP?
- YEAH.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.369
WAS HIS HEALTHIER?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.604
- I-- I--
- LET ME ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION:

16:44.704 --> 16:47.874
- WAS IT OVER $12? HUH?
- DO YOU WANT ME TO REFILL
YOUR WATER OR--

16:47.974 --> 16:50.110
JUST SCRATCH YOUR FACE
WITH YOUR FINGER IF
IT WAS OVER $12.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.478
I-- I COULD
REALLY GET IN TROUBLE
WITH MY MANAGER.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.380
NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.881
SCRATCH YOUR FACE
WITH YOUR FINGER
IF IT WAS OVER $12.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.384
GO AHEAD,
JUST SCRATCH IT.
WAS IT OVER $12?

16:57.484 --> 17:01.088
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

17:01.188 --> 17:04.191
LET ME ASK YOU
THIS QUESTION:
WAS IT OVER $15?

17:04.291 --> 17:05.358
JUST TUG
ON YOUR TIE UP HERE.
WAS IT OVER $15?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.160
THIS IS MAKING ME
REAL UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.162
NOBODY'S EVEN...
( stammers ) TO ANYTHING
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.331
WAS IT OVER $15?
TUG ON YOUR TIE.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.966
- OH MY F-- OH FUCK!
- SIR?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.902
IS THAT ALL
I CAN GET YOU?

17:16.002 --> 17:18.971
NO, DON'T GO YET.
ONE SECOND. I HAVE
ONE MORE QUESTION TO ASK YOU.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.075
DID THAT SON OF A BITCH
GIVE YOU A $20 TIP?

17:22.175 --> 17:25.278
- WHAT IF IT WAS MORE?
- HOW MUCH DID
HE GIVE YOU?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.414
- HUH? WAS IT OVER $30?
- DO YOU WANT THE CHECK?

17:27.514 --> 17:30.583
YEAH, IF IT'S OVER $30,
I WANT YOU TO RAISE THAT CUP
OVER THAT POT.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.553
- OKAY, I HOPE
YOU ENJOYED YOUR MEAL...
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.622
...AND COME BACK SOON.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.730
- Larry: HEY!
- Jeff: HI, HOW ARE YOU?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.298
GOOD.
GUESS WHAT.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.434
- WHAT?
- I'VE GOT SOME NEWS.
THEY'RE ALL IN.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.470
- REALLY?
- WE'RE DOING
THE REUNION SHOW.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.573
- FANTASTIC, MAN!
- IS THAT UNBELIEVABLE?

17:53.673 --> 17:57.610
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WHO'D HAVE THUNK?
NOW CHECK THIS OUT.

17:57.710 --> 18:03.250
SUSIE HAS LYME DISEASE.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.585
- WHO SAVED HER LIFE?
WHO SAVED HER LIFE?
- CAN YOU-- I SAVED HER LIFE.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.155
- YOU SAVED HER LIFE.
- DR. DAVID.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.223
- DR. DAVID.
PAGING DR. DAVID.
- YOU KNOW, SHE WENT TO--

18:10.323 --> 18:12.259
- CALLING DR. DAVID.
- HOW MANY DOCTORS
DID SHE GO TO?

18:12.359 --> 18:14.093
I MEAN,
THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.566
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.435
CHERYL!
HEY, CHERYL!

18:22.535 --> 18:23.770
HEY.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.475
OH, I'LL-- I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS INSIDE.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.943
- HI.
- HEY.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.446
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- YEAH.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.782
- HOW ARE YOU? GOOD.
- GOOD. GOOD.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.617
SO REMEMBER
I WAS TELLING YOU

18:37.717 --> 18:40.287
THAT I WAS GONNA SEE THEM
ABOUT A "SEINFELD" REUNION?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.155
- YEAH.
- WE'RE DOING THE SHOW.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.823
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.825
AND YOU...

18:45.925 --> 18:48.495
ARE GONNA PLAY
GEORGE'S EX-WIFE.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.764
- I AM?
- DO YOU WANT TO?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.233
- OH MY GOD!
- HUH?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.534
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I SWEAR TO GOD.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.370
- CAN YOU ACT? HUH?
- ( laughs ) YES.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.406
- YOU CAN? ARE YOU SURE?
- I CAN. I AM VERY GOOD.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.541
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
EMBARRASS ME, ARE YOU?
- NO.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.843
- I MEAN, I'VE GOT
TO TALK TO JERRY.
- THANK YOU SO--

19:03.943 --> 19:06.313
- I'M SURE HE WON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM WITH IT.
- OH MY GOD, LARRY.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.648
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.717
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO ME.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.085
- THANK YOU.
- WOW.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.154
OH MY GOD,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.123
- REALLY?
- OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.959
- YEAH, I'VE JUST
GOT TO TALK TO JERRY.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.862
OH MY GOD!
OH MY GOD!

19:25.498 --> 19:27.467
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.436
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LOOK ON HER FACE.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.438
- I COULDN'T GET OVER IT.
- Man: HERE ARE YOUR
TICKETS, SIR.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.373
THANK YOU.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.108
WE'LL GO SEE
A FANTASTIC GAME, HUH?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.877
- IT'S ALL WORKING OUT.
- YEAH.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.979
WHERE ARE THESE?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.681
( rock music playing )

19:41.781 --> 19:43.883
Announcer:
And the home team,
your Los Angeles--

19:43.983 --> 19:46.353
- Larry: 319.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- ( crowd cheers )

19:46.453 --> 19:49.055
LOOK AT THIS.
THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.357
HE COULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN US SEATS UP HERE.

19:50.457 --> 19:54.527
- THIS IS A JOKE.
JUST A JOKE.
- OH MY GOD.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.763
CAN YOU BELIEVE THESE SEATS
THIS GUY GAVE US?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.731
- ( buzzer blares )
- ( whistle tweets )

19:58.831 --> 20:01.734
LOOK AT THIS.
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.304
- Announcer: Â£5...
- UNBELIEVABLE.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.473
THIS IS CRAZY.
WE COULD'VE STAYED HOME

20:06.573 --> 20:08.275
- AND WATCHED IT ON TV.
- I COULD HAVE RIDDEN
THE TREADMILL,

20:08.375 --> 20:10.277
WATCHED IT ON TV
AND GOTTEN THE SAME EFFECT.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.745
WHY? WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?
WHY WOULD HE GIVE--
DID HE DO IT ON PURPOSE?

20:12.845 --> 20:15.848
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SHOULD WE GIVE HIM
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?

20:15.948 --> 20:19.419
- YEAH, I GUESS.
- I'M NOT USED TO GIVING PEOPLE
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.554
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO CONDITION
MYSELF TO DO IT.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.756
I THOUGHT HE HAD
COURTSIDE SEATS.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.626
CAN I-- CAN I BORROW
YOUR BINOCULARS
FOR A SECOND?

20:26.726 --> 20:29.329
- YEAH, SURE.
- SIR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.665
- ( crowd cheering )
- ( announcer speaking )

20:32.765 --> 20:36.235
Jeff:
OH, HE DOES HAVE
COURTSIDE SEATS.

20:36.336 --> 20:40.307
HE'S SITTING IN THEM--
HE AND DAVID SPADE.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.609
- WHAT?
- HE'S SITTING NEXT
TO DAVID SPADE.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.613
Larry:
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.449
I'M GONNA CALL HIM.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.285
- FUCKING ASSHOLE.
- ( beeps )

20:59.359 --> 21:01.728
- ( gasps ) OH!
- WHAT?

21:01.828 --> 21:03.930
HE SCREENED MY CALL.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.265
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE SCREENED YOUR CALL?
- I SAW HIM ON THE BINOCULARS.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.601
HE SCREENED THE CALL.
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
PEOPLE WERE DOING THAT

21:08.701 --> 21:10.169
WHEN I CALLED THEM.
THIS JUST CONFIRMS IT.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.704
SEE, IT TAUGHT ME
A LESSON.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.606
I WAS GONNA GIVE SOMEBODY
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT--

21:13.706 --> 21:16.343
I ALMOST DID--
AND THEN SOMETHING
SAID "NO, DON'T."

21:16.443 --> 21:18.878
DON'T. IT'S NOT FOR YOU."
THAT'S NOT MY THING.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.080
THAT WAS A COMPLETE
AND UTTER WASTE OF TIME.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.383
- OH, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.
- WHY'D WE EVEN STAY
THE WHOLE TIME?

21:23.483 --> 21:26.085
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
- OH, SANDY GOODMAN.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.088
LISTEN.
JUST DON'T GO NUTS.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.291
ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW YOU WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING, BUT DON'T--

21:32.392 --> 21:34.694
- I'LL TALK TO YOU
TOMORROW.
- OKAY.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.097
- HEY.
- HEY, LARRY.
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.732
- YEAH.
- DID YOU ENJOY THE GAME?

21:39.832 --> 21:42.602
WELL...

21:42.702 --> 21:45.171
Jerry:
YOU TOLD THE HEAD OF NBC
TO GO FUCK HIMSELF?

21:45.271 --> 21:47.807
YEAH, I DID.
THE GUY SAID HE'S GONNA
FIX ME UP WITH TICKETS.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.076
HE PUTS ME UP
IN THE RAFTERS,
THE WORST SEATS.

21:50.176 --> 21:53.012
- SO WHAT?
- AND THEN I CAUGHT THE ASSHOLE
SCREENING MY CALL!

21:53.112 --> 21:55.515
SO CRAP ON
THE HEAD OF THE NETWORK?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:55.615 --> 21:58.451
HE'S APOPLECTIC.
APOPLECTIC, LARRY.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.287
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!

22:01.388 --> 22:03.756
- YEAH.
- Julia: YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS UNACCEPTABLE?

22:03.856 --> 22:08.060
IT IS TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE

22:08.160 --> 22:10.296
THAT YOU WOULD GRILL
MY DAUGHTER GRACIE

22:10.397 --> 22:14.166
ABOUT WHETHER I TOOK HER
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

22:14.266 --> 22:18.270
AND THEN
YOU CALL ME A LIAR?

22:18.371 --> 22:20.907
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
I DIDN'T REALLY GRILL HER.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.909
I JUST ASKED A QUESTION.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.711
AND I DIDN'T
CALL YOU A LIAR.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.447
I JUST SAID
IT WAS... INTERESTING.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.450
WHAT ABOUT THIS
WOULD YOU FIND
INTERESTING, LARRY?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.553
WELL, THE FACT THAT
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE

22:33.653 --> 22:36.022
TAKING HER
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.758
AND SHE SAID SHE NEVER WENT
TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.593
SO I THOUGHT THAT
WAS INTERESTING.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.195
DO YOU ALSO FIND IT
INTERESTING THAT,

22:43.295 --> 22:46.499
IN FACT,
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.269
GRACE AND MARY.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.439
I TOOK MARY
TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.708
- THAT'S INTERESTING.
- WHAT I FIND INTERESTING--

22:55.808 --> 22:57.644
IN FACT, FASCINATING--
IS THAT YOU WOULD

22:57.744 --> 23:00.379
GO BACK TO A RESTAURANT
WHERE YOU AND I HAD A MEAL

23:00.480 --> 23:03.315
FOR THE SHEER PURPOSE
OF HARASSING A WAITER

23:03.416 --> 23:05.818
FOR THE MOST
INSIGNIFICANT INCIDENT,

23:05.918 --> 23:07.887
I'M SURE,
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
IN THIS MAN'S LIFE.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.922
WE SPLIT A CHECK
AND HE DOESN'T WANT
TO COORDINATE THE TIP!

23:10.022 --> 23:11.524
- Jason: WHY SHOULD I?
- WHY SHOULD YOU?

23:11.624 --> 23:12.892
WHY DO I NEED
TO COORDINATE THE TIP?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.461
YOU GO OUT WITH A FRIEND,
YOU TIP IN CONCERT!

23:14.561 --> 23:16.896
WHY ARE WE IN CONCERT?
THERE'S NO CONCERT!

23:16.996 --> 23:18.965
- NO, TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
TWO DIFFERENT TIPS.
- WE'RE NOT IN CONCERT!

23:19.065 --> 23:20.800
- A TIP IS A SOLO, LARRY.
- Larry: NO, IT'S NOT!

23:20.900 --> 23:23.335
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. SOLO.
- YOU TIP IN CONCERT!

23:23.436 --> 23:25.472
- A TIP IS A SOLO.
- WHAT IS THE BIG SECRET?

23:25.572 --> 23:27.807
HE'S GOT A BIG SECRET!
WHAT IS THE BIG SECRET?!

23:27.907 --> 23:30.777
YOU'RE DIGGING INTO
MY PERSONAL-- YOU-YOU GOTTA
KNOW WHAT MY TAXES ARE?!

23:30.877 --> 23:32.545
- YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I PAID FOR MY HOUSE?!
- NO, I JUST THINK

23:32.645 --> 23:33.613
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO! THAT'S ALL!

23:33.713 --> 23:34.881
THERE'S NO RIGHT
AND WRONG TO IT.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.916
IN FACT, YOU'RE WRONG
AND I'M RIGHT!

23:37.016 --> 23:39.351
- THAT'S NOT EVEN THE BIG
ISSUE HERE, BY THE WAY.
- Julia: THERE WE GO.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.053
BECAUSE UNLESS YOU APOLOGIZE
TO SANDY GOODMAN,

23:41.153 --> 23:43.022
THERE'S NOT EVEN GOING
TO BE A REUNION SHOW.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.657
WHAT REUNION SHOW?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.895
- DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM?
- Larry: YES, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:48.995 --> 23:50.663
WE DISCUSSED IT
THE OTHER DAY AT LUNCH.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.866
- I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
TELLING ME THAT.
- WHAT?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.335
YOU TOLD ME POINT BLANK.
YOU DISCUSSED IT. EVERYBODY'S--

23:56.435 --> 23:57.570
- THIS IS NOT COOL.
- I DID DISCUSS IT!

23:57.670 --> 23:59.305
Michael:
LOOK, A REUNION SHOW--

23:59.405 --> 24:01.674
LET'S DO IT.
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.409
Jerry:
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT
ALL THE PRINCIPALS,

24:03.510 --> 24:05.244
BUT THE PROJECT'S
IN THE TOILET

24:05.344 --> 24:08.114
BECAUSE LARRY DAVID
DOESN'T WANT TO SIT
IN THE LOGE.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.583
I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS THE LOGE.
THAT WAS WAY UP.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.653
LARRY, YOU HAVE GOT
TO SPEAK WITH SANDY.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.722
YOU HAVE GOT TO
CLEAN UP THAT MESS.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.824
YOU'VE GOT TO APOLOGIZE.

24:17.924 --> 24:21.260
Jeff:
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
LEFT YOU ALONE WITH GOODMAN.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.329
JERRY'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT TO APOLOGIZE.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.732
FINE.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.934
OH, WHAT, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU GONNA GO
IN BEGRUDGINGLY

24:28.034 --> 24:29.969
- OR ARE YOU GONNA
GO IN SINCERE?
- BEGRUDGINGLY.

24:30.069 --> 24:33.305
( sighs )
YOU CAN'T GIVE
A BEGRUDGING APOLOGY.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.807
YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE
A SINCERE APOLOGY.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.676
I'LL GO
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

24:36.776 --> 24:38.645
BEGRUDGING AND SINCERE.
HOW'S THAT?

24:38.745 --> 24:40.112
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN?
WHERE BETWEEN?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.148
- I'LL STRADDLE THE LINE.
- WHAT KIND OF LINE?

24:42.248 --> 24:44.984
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY
SINCERE AND IT'S NOT
COMPLETELY BEGRUDGING.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.786
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE
THE LINE IS--
THE LINE IS

24:46.886 --> 24:48.855
YOU PROBABLY
FUCK UP THE APOLOGY.
THAT'S THE LINE.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.424
IF I FUCK UP THE APOLOGY,
THEN I'LL APOLOGIZE
FOR THE BAD APOLOGY.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.661
YOU CAN'T APOLOGIZE
FOR AN APOLOGY!

24:54.761 --> 24:56.162
YOU GET ONE SHOT,
THAT'S IT.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.798
HEY, WHAT ABOUT CHERYL?

25:02.902 --> 25:05.337
- OKAY.
- THERE YOU GO.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.940
- ALL RIGHT.
- I'M GONNA HATE MYSELF
MORE THAN NORMALLY.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.010
HEY, JEFF,
DID YOU SEE
MY CELL PHONE?

25:11.110 --> 25:12.344
UH, NO, I DID NOT.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.246
HI, LAR.
OH, HERE IT IS.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.415
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
I'VE GOTTA RUN.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.551
DON'T FORGET
TO PICK UP SAMMY, OKAY?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.186
- I'M NOT GONNA FORGET.
- Susie: ALL RIGHT.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.654
- HEY.
- WHAT?

25:21.754 --> 25:23.990
NO "THANK YOU, LARRY,

25:24.090 --> 25:26.993
FOR SAVING MY LIFE"?

25:27.093 --> 25:29.762
SAVING MY LIFE?
HOW'D YOU SAVE MY LIFE?

25:29.862 --> 25:32.231
- YOU DIDN'T SAVE MY LIFE.
- I DIAGNOSED YOUR ILLNESS.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.366
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IT'S TREATED,
AND I'M FEELING GREAT.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.836
- GIVE IT UP, MAN.
- GIVE WHAT UP?

25:36.936 --> 25:39.138
WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOESN'T SAY
THANK YOU TO ANOTHER PERSON
FOR SAVING THEIR LIFE?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.741
- OH, LARRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.276
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I'D BE DEAD WITHOUT YOU.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.245
- YOU WOULD BE!
- OH, BULLSHIT!

25:46.345 --> 25:48.615
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS TO LYME DISEASE
IF IT'S LEFT UNTREATED?

25:48.715 --> 25:51.017
- WHAT?
- EVERYTHING GOES--
THE KIDNEYS, THE JOINTS,

25:51.117 --> 25:53.653
- THE LUNGS,
THE HEART-- EVERYTHING!
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD BE

25:53.753 --> 25:56.288
VERY GLAD
I'M FEELING BETTER,
SHOULDN'T YOU?!

25:56.388 --> 25:57.824
IF SOMEBODY SAVED MY LIFE,
I'D BE FUCKING KISSING--

25:57.924 --> 25:59.592
YOU DIDN'T SAVE
MY LIFE, ASSHOLE!

25:59.692 --> 26:01.894
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

26:01.994 --> 26:05.531
NEXT TIME I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING, OKAY?!

26:05.632 --> 26:08.000
I'M GONNA KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT
AND LET YOU DIE!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.869
- YOU WANT ME TO DIE?
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:09.969 --> 26:12.171
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SPOT
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.973
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
- DON'T GET IT CHECKED OUT.
IT'S NOT SKIN CANCER.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.708
- OUT OUT OUT OUT!
- DON'T CHECK THAT OUT,

26:15.808 --> 26:17.576
THAT LITTLE SPOT
YOU GOT THERE.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.413
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

26:21.513 --> 26:24.050
IF I OFFENDED YOU

26:24.150 --> 26:26.052
OR INSULTED YOU

26:26.152 --> 26:28.888
IN ANY WAY.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.626
SO THIS IS ME

26:33.726 --> 26:36.062
APOLOGIZING.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.632
IT'S ABOUT AS SORRY
AS I CAN GET.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.035
I GUESS
MY QUESTION IS:

26:44.536 --> 26:47.306
WAS IT SORRY ENOUGH?

26:48.574 --> 26:50.209
THAT'S IT?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.878
- NO GOOD?
- "NO GOOD"?

26:51.978 --> 26:54.981
- TOO BEGRUDGING?
- VERY BEGRUDGING.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.049
CAN I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE APOLOGY?

26:57.149 --> 26:59.686
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO PUT THE KIBOSH

26:59.786 --> 27:02.588
ON OUR RELATIONSHIP.

27:02.689 --> 27:06.392
I CAN SEE WHERE
THIS ROAD IS GOING
AND I DON'T LIKE IT,

27:06.492 --> 27:10.562
SO WE'RE DONE.
THE REUNION SHOW IS OFF.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.564
- YEAH.
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.035
- I'LL BE FINE.
- GOOD LUCK TO YOUR NETWORK,

27:16.135 --> 27:20.673
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY, I COULD NOT FIND
YOUR ACID REFLUX PILLS,

27:20.773 --> 27:22.742
SO I GOT YOU TUMS
AND ECHINACEA.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.476
- THANK YOU.
- I FOUND THE GINSENG.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.713
- OH, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, YOU SICK?
- I HAVE A STIFF NECK.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.448
I HAVE ACHES.
I HAVE PAINS.

27:29.548 --> 27:33.786
- I'M NOT WELL.
- HAVE YOU BEEN IN
ANY TALL GRASS RECENTLY?

27:33.886 --> 27:35.621
IN THE HAMPTONS
OVER THE WEEKEND,

27:35.722 --> 27:37.724
YES, WITH MY KID. WHY?

27:39.258 --> 27:41.694
NO REASON.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.508
LARRY,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.677
- AH.
- NOW GO DO WHAT YOU DO.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.112
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.881
HEY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.182
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.517
PICK IT UP
FROM KRAMER'S ENTRANCE.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.686
- YUP.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.792
LARRY,
I WANT YOU BACK.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.061
LET'S GO HOME
AND MAKE LOVE.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.464
( people chatting )

28:28.707 --> 28:30.843
( people crying )

28:36.415 --> 28:38.217
AH.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.804
( phone rings )

28:57.904 --> 29:00.539
- Jerry: HELLO. HEY.
- HEY. SO GUESS WHAT.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.941
- WHAT?
- SHOW'S BACK ON.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.575
- Get out of here!
- YEAH!

29:03.675 --> 29:05.277
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- I know!

29:05.377 --> 29:07.513
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- I TALKED TO GOODMAN

29:07.613 --> 29:09.782
- AND I STRAIGHTENED IT OUT.
- And you apologized.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.885
- No.
- WELL, LISTEN. YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.821
I'M DRIVING ALONG--
I'M IN BEVERLY HILLS--

29:14.921 --> 29:16.889
You'll never guess
who I bump into.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.657
- I GIVE UP.
- MEG RYAN.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.127
- Who?
- MEG RYAN.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.762
- Really?
- AND I SAID,
"YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

29:23.863 --> 29:26.432
OUR DREAM CAST

29:26.532 --> 29:27.699
FOR GEORGE'S EX-WIFE."

29:27.800 --> 29:29.535
- And she's gonna do it!
- WHAT?

29:29.635 --> 29:31.770
- I'm gonna put
her on. Hold on.
- Meg: Larry!

29:31.871 --> 29:34.506
ISN'T THIS GREAT!
GEORGE'S EX-WIFE!

29:34.606 --> 29:36.408
( laughs )
I CAN'T BEL--
IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.111
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS.
HERE'S JERRY.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.713
Jerry:

29:41.814 --> 29:43.582

29:43.682 --> 29:45.885
( theme music playing )
