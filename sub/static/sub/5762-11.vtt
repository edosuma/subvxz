WEBVTT

00:01.104 --> 00:03.578
NO, why did you want me to the basketball game?

00:03.614 --> 00:06.188
I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A FIELD GOAL
AND A SLAM DUNK.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.898
THEY DON'T HAVE
FIELD GOALS
IN BASKETBALL.

00:07.933 --> 00:09.765
THAT'S FOOTBALL.
NO, BASKETBALL, TOO

00:09.800 --> 00:11.378
OH, JIM,
WHY DON'T YOU COME?

00:11.413 --> 00:13.094
NED WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE YOU THERE.

00:13.129 --> 00:14.832
AH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I GOT THE NIGHT SHIFT.

00:14.832 --> 00:16.032
YOU KNOW?

00:17.500 --> 00:18.301
LOOK, I WOULDN'T ASK,

00:18.368 --> 00:19.934
EXCEPT THIS IS
A NEW SCHOOL FOR HIM,

00:20.001 --> 00:21.068
HE JUST TRANSFERRED IN,

00:21.134 --> 00:22.435
AND I KNOW
HE WOULD APPRECIATE

00:22.500 --> 00:24.615
SEEING A FEW
FAMILIAR FACES THERE.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.759
I'D BE HAPPY TO COME.

00:25.794 --> 00:26.712
HUH! THAT'S GREAT!

00:26.712 --> 00:28.201
OH, HE WILL
SO THRILLED!

00:28.235 --> 00:30.767
OH, I HOPE HE GETS
A TOUCHDOWN!

HEY, HONEY, WE'RE HERE.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.292
YEAH, I SAW THAT, MOM.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.262
DID YOU SAY HI
TO MELINDA?

00:51.297 --> 00:53.087
HI, MELINDA.
HI, NED.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.992
AND I HAVE SNACKS
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

00:55.027 --> 00:57.384
OH, NO.
REALLY, I'M OK, MOM.

00:57.419 --> 00:59.074
I KNOW IT MEANS A LOT
TO HIM THAT WE'RE HERE.

00:59.109 --> 01:00.981
I CAN SEE THAT.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.217
IS THAT BRAD? NO.34

01:04.251 --> 01:05.183
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

01:05.236 --> 01:07.620
WHAT CAN HE DO
THAT YOU CAN'T DO?

01:13.819 --> 01:15.044
THAT.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.101
WAY TO GO, BRAD!

01:21.001 --> 01:22.234
IS THAT HIS GIRLFRIEND?

01:22.301 --> 01:23.801
YEAH, HER NAME'S
KRISTA.

01:33.189 --> 01:34.292
I DON'T KNOW.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.975
WHAT HAPPENED?
NED, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:37.010 --> 01:38.317
BRAD'S POINTS AREN'T UP.

01:38.352 --> 01:40.273
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE SCOREBOARD.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.012
MAYBE SHE NEEDS HELP.

01:46.800 --> 01:53.094
"34 + GF = DEATH."

01:53.129 --> 01:53.995
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:54.379 --> 01:55.869
34, THAT'S BRAD'S
NUMBER.

01:55.904 --> 01:57.807
SO "GF" IS GOTTA BE
GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

01:57.842 --> 02:01.266
YEAH, BRAD AND KRISTA
ARE LIKE THIS
UBER COUPLE.

02:01.301 --> 02:02.834
WHAT?

02:03.787 --> 02:05.201
"SLAMMERS BE SLAMMED?"

02:10.957 --> 02:13.978
WAIT, THIS DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THAT AWFUL SLAM BOOK?

02:14.013 --> 02:15.656
WHAT'S A SLAM BOOK?

02:15.691 --> 02:17.273
IT'S JUST THIS
TERRIBLE WEBSITE

02:17.308 --> 02:21.653
WHERE STUDENTS
CAN ANONYMOUSLY SLAM
EACH OTHER. IT'S--UGH.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.082
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.368
DELIA, GET UP, GO!

02:28.435 --> 02:33.250
OK, NED, COME ON, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE.NED...

02:55.000 --> 02:58.135
NED, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

03:03.156 --> 03:05.130
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE SLAM BOOK.

03:05.165 --> 03:08.026
IT'S JUST A WAY
TO HURT PEOPLE.

03:09.432 --> 03:11.556
WELL, IT'S WORKING.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.692
??? T BEFORE
THE BLEACHERS CLOSED,

03:45.758 --> 03:47.807
THE SCOREBOARD SAID
"SLAMMERS BE SLAMMED."

03:47.842 --> 03:48.573
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A GHOST

03:48.573 --> 03:50.697
WHO'S A BIG FAN
OF A JUMP SHOT.

03:50.732 --> 03:53.342
YOU KNOW, AS OPPOSED
TO SLAM DUNKS.

03:53.377 --> 03:55.000
NOTHING? THESE ARE
BASKETBALL REFERENCES.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.225
WHY AM I WASTING
MY TIME?

03:56.225 --> 03:58.048
OK, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A SLAM BOOK?

03:58.083 --> 03:59.091
OF COURSE I HAVE.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.639
THE INTERNET'S
WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTION

04:00.674 --> 04:02.122
TO RUINING REPUTATIONS
EVERYWHERE.

04:02.122 --> 04:04.950
YEAH, THESE KIDS
JUST CREATE A WEBPAGE
AND TEAR INTO EACH OTHER.

04:05.033 --> 04:06.022
EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

04:06.022 --> 04:07.662
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO SNEAK INTO
THE BOY'S LOCKER ROOM

04:07.662 --> 04:09.881
TO FIND OUT WHAT
THEY WROTE ON THE WALL.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.233
NOT THAT I EVER DID THAT.

04:11.299 --> 04:13.218
I NEVER DID THAT,
EITHER. EVER.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.682
I NEVER HAD
ANYTHING WRITTEN
ABOUT ME, EITHER,

04:14.682 --> 04:16.866
WHICH IS AWFUL.
ZIP, ZERO, NOTHING.
IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE?

04:16.933 --> 04:18.599
YEAH, TRY THIS--
"WANT MILK?

04:18.666 --> 04:20.766
TRY JAY BAKER'S MAN BOOBS.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.332
SO YOU THINK THIS GHOST
IS LASHING OUT

04:22.339 --> 04:24.233
BECAUSE OF WHAT
SOMEBODY WROTE ABOUT IT
IN THE SLAM BOOK?

04:24.239 --> 04:27.755
MAYBE. ESPECIALLY
IF WHAT WAS WRITTEN
BY BRAD AND KRISTA.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.633
HEY, MORNING.
HEY, PROFESSOR PAYNE.

04:29.699 --> 04:31.267
HEY, YOU TWO.
HEY

04:31.332 --> 04:33.800
HEY, NED, HOW ARE THINGS
GOING AT SCHOOL?
WEIRD.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.090
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED NOW?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.824
WELL, THE SCHOOL TNKS
THEY HAVE A SUSPECT

04:36.824 --> 04:38.820
IN THAT GYM INCIDENT
LAST NIGHT.

04:38.866 --> 04:40.781
THE GIRL WHO RAN
THE SCOREBOARD,
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

04:40.816 --> 04:41.610
LUCY.

04:41.637 --> 04:43.299
WELL, THAT MEANS
IT'S NOT A GHOST, THEN.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.133
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
WHO YOU TALK TO.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.037
THE SCHOOL FEELS
THEY CAUGHT THE CULPRIT.
NED, ON THE OTHER HAND...

04:48.072 --> 04:50.081
LUCY'S BROTHER DIED
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

04:50.116 --> 04:51.733
YEAH, HE HIT HIS HEAD
SKATEBOARDING.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.100
HE SEEMED FINE,
AND THEN HE JUST
FELL ASLEEP.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.233
CONCUSSIONS
ARE LIKE THAT--
TOTALLY STEALTH.

04:56.299 --> 04:57.566
OH, THAT IS AWFUL.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.566
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT

04:59.633 --> 05:01.299
IT MAKES SENSE
THAT LUCY DID IT.

05:01.366 --> 05:03.167
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS UPSET,
UNDERSTANDABLY.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.739
MAYBE SHE BLAMES
BRAD AND KRISTA

05:04.750 --> 05:07.332
EVEN THOUGH
HER BROTHER'S DEATH
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

05:07.399 --> 05:08.469
WHAT IS HER BROTHER'S NAME?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.171
THOMAS. THOMAS BENJAMIN.

05:15.556 --> 05:17.599
WELL, THAT'S STRANGE.
THERE'S PRACTICALLY
NOTHING HERE.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.836
JUST ONE KID
CALLING HIM GUANO BOY.
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

05:20.836 --> 05:21.906
WHERE CAN I FIND A PICTURE?

05:21.906 --> 05:24.016
CHECK THE SCHOOL
FACE PAGE. HERE.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.482
GUANO BOY'S
BETTER THAN NOTHIN'.

05:26.517 --> 05:28.451
AT LEAST HE'S NOT INVISIBLE.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.106
HELLO?

05:30.141 --> 05:32.982
DO YOU GUYS EVEN HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:34.170 --> 05:35.787
I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAUSED
ALL THAT STUFF

05:35.800 --> 05:36.880
WITH THE SCOREBOARD
AND BLEACHERS,

05:36.880 --> 05:39.399
BUT I KNOW HE WAS THERE LAST
NIGHT. THIS IS THE GHOST I SAW.

05:39.466 --> 05:41.200
REALLY?
MOM.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.499
WHAT?

05:42.566 --> 05:45.866
SO IF IT WAS THE GHOST,
THAT'S GOOD NEWS, RIGHT?

05:45.933 --> 05:47.332
AT LEAST FOR LUCY.

05:47.399 --> 05:50.100
YOU CAN TELL
THAT NED'S A LITTLE
BIASED ON THE SUBJECT.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.621
SO LUCY'S A FRIEND?

05:51.656 --> 05:53.033
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.697
UH, NED, I TAKE IT
YOU DON'T AGREE

05:54.700 --> 05:58.499
WITH, UH, BRITFAN20-12
WHO DESCRIBES LUCY
AS, QUOTE,

05:58.566 --> 06:00.332
"SATAN'S DEADLY
GIRL PAWN?"

06:00.399 --> 06:02.033
WHOEVER WROTE THAT
DOESN'T KNOW HER.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.583
SHE'S REALLY COOL.
YOU SHOULD MEET HER.

06:04.618 --> 06:07.174
SO THEN WHY DON'T YOU
INTRODUCE ME?

06:09.100 --> 06:11.833
UH, GEOMETRY CLASS?
I SIT RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.161
UH, RIGHT NEXT
TO TONY NEIL.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.167
SPANISH 2.

06:16.233 --> 06:17.633
I SIT IN THE BACK,
OVER TO THE LEFT,

06:17.699 --> 06:19.399
UH, BY THE PENCIL
SHARPENER.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.250
I'M SORRY, I HAVE NO CLUE.

06:22.285 --> 06:25.866
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,
I'M NEW AT SCHOOL, TED.

06:25.933 --> 06:27.066
NED.

06:27.133 --> 06:27.793
I'M NEW, TOO.

06:27.793 --> 06:29.866
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT, UH--

06:29.933 --> 06:32.362
UH, LUCY, I'M MELINDA.

06:32.366 --> 06:36.699
NED TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.903
THANKS. UM...

06:39.488 --> 06:40.100
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.966
WELL, I WAS AT THE GYM
LAST NIGHT.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.284
YEAH, LOOK,

06:44.299 --> 06:45.933
I ALREADY TALKED
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
ABOUT IT, SO...

06:46.000 --> 06:48.866
I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU DID IT.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.499
I WAS THERE
AT THE SCOREBOARD.

06:50.566 --> 06:52.666
I'M ALL EMOTIONALLY MESSED UP
ABOUT MY BROTHER.

06:52.733 --> 06:53.833
IT HAD TO BE ME, RIGHT?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.198
WELL, IT'S HARD
TO EXPLAIN,

06:55.200 --> 06:58.507
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
SOMEONE ELSE DID IT.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.053
WHY?

07:01.088 --> 07:04.167
DO YOU BLAME BRAD AND KRISTA
FOR YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH?

07:05.299 --> 07:07.533
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
WHY WOULD I BLAME THEM?

07:07.599 --> 07:09.444
WHOEVER WROTE
"SLAMMERS BE SLAMMED"

07:09.500 --> 07:11.948
OBVIOUSLY BLAMES THEM
FOR SOMETHING.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.000
CAN I ASK YOU MORE
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER?

07:15.066 --> 07:17.973
I HEARD THAT HE DIED
IN A SKATEBOARDING
ACCIDENT.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.090
HE CAME HOME THAT NIGHT
AND PUT A BAG OF ICE
ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

07:21.325 --> 07:22.499
HE HAD HIS SKATEBOARD
WITH HIM,

07:22.566 --> 07:25.417
SO I FIGURED HE JUST
WIPED OUT AGAIN.

07:25.452 --> 07:28.566
AND THEN HE WENT TO SLEEP
AND NEVER WOKE UP.

07:29.071 --> 07:29.933
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.299
ANYTHING HE SAID?

07:31.300 --> 07:33.466
NOTHING HE SAID.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.599
BUT I NOTICED
THERE WAS LIKE...

07:36.666 --> 07:38.466
CHALK ON HIS JACKET.

07:38.533 --> 07:39.900
LIKE, THE KIND
THAT THEY USE

07:39.900 --> 07:42.100
TO WRITE THE NAME
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM
ON THE FIELD.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.366
THIS IS GONNA SOUND
LIKE A WEIRD QUESTION,

07:45.432 --> 07:47.793
BUT WERE THERE ANY
BAD FEELINGS

07:47.828 --> 07:48.666
BETWEEN THOMAS
AND KRISTA--

07:48.733 --> 07:50.666
WHAT DOES THE GYM THING
LAST NIGHT

07:50.733 --> 07:53.489
HAVE TO DO WITH THOMAS?
HE'S DEAD.

07:54.146 --> 07:55.919
OH, I GET IT, OK.

07:55.954 --> 07:59.800
YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T
THINK THAT I HAD ANYTHING
TO WITH IT, BUT...

07:59.866 --> 08:01.066
NO, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.843
WHY CAN'T EVERYBODY
JUST GIVE ME A BREAK?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.800
LUCY!
HEY. LET HER GO.

08:06.348 --> 08:08.612
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
IN A LITTLE BIT.

08:23.493 --> 08:24.000
OH...

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
AAAH!

08:49.200 --> 08:51.193
AAAH!

08:52.293 --> 08:53.938
PLEASE, PLEASE STOP!
HE'S HARMLESS!

08:53.973 --> 08:55.267
JUST LET HIM FLY AWAY!

09:04.533 --> 09:06.100
I DON'T GET
WHY WE CAN'T TELL LUCY.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.366
SHE'D BE SO RELIEVED
TO KNOW THAT HER BROTHER'S HERE.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.533
FOR STARTERS, SHE'D HAVE
SOME ANSWERS FOR EVERYTHING
SHE'S BEING ACCUSED OF.

09:11.599 --> 09:13.432
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA BE
RELIEVED, NED.

09:13.499 --> 09:15.167
IT'S A LOT
FOR ONE PERSON
TO HANDLE.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.066
I HANDLED IT WHEN YOU TOLD ME
MY DAD'S GHOST WAS HERE.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.291
I DON'T WANT
TO TELL HER
ABOUT HER BROTHER

09:18.300 --> 09:19.432
UNTIL I KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.

09:19.499 --> 09:21.233
Officer: LUCY BENJAMIN?
YEAH?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.733
GRANDVIEW POLICE.
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.491
WHO WOULD PUT
A BAT IN THERE?

09:25.500 --> 09:26.966
I MEAN, WHO WOULD
THINK OF THAT?

09:30.566 --> 09:31.766
IT WAS YOU.

09:31.833 --> 09:32.767
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

09:32.767 --> 09:34.699
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:34.766 --> 09:36.814
Brad: KRISTA, TAKE IT EASY.

09:36.849 --> 09:38.414
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

09:38.449 --> 09:40.480
I'M LIKE THE ONLY PERSON
IN THIS WHOLE SCHOOL

09:40.515 --> 09:41.527
WHO'S BEEN NICE
TO YOUR BROTHER.

09:41.550 --> 09:42.626
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.777
I DIED BECAU OF YOU.
THAT'S WHY.

09:45.812 --> 09:49.412
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA PAY--
BOTH OF YOU.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.200
I JUST DON'T GET
WHY THE COPS WERE THERE.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.583
LUCY'S NOT SOME PSYCHO.

09:58.618 --> 09:59.767
IT'S THE WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.500
SCHOOLS FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN'T BE TOO CAUTIOUS.

10:02.567 --> 10:03.864
WELL, DOES THOMAS
HAVE ANY IDEA

10:03.901 --> 10:05.933
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE
HE'S GETTING
HIS SISTER IN?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.434
WELL, MAYBE HE DOES,
MAYBE HE DOESN'T.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.901
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT HE HAS AGAINST
THOSE TWO,

10:09.906 --> 10:11.567
AND WHAT IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE SLAM BOOK.

10:11.634 --> 10:12.667
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

10:12.734 --> 10:14.066
WELL, USUALLY I WOULD
TALK TO LUCY,

10:14.133 --> 10:15.567
BUT SHE SEEMS TO THINK
I'M JUST ANOTHER ADULT

10:15.634 --> 10:18.500
WHO WANTS TO BLAME HER
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE GYM.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.100
WHO ELSE CAN WE GET
TO TALK TO HER?

10:23.661 --> 10:24.200
I DON'T KNOW.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.176
I MEAN,
THIS WHOLE THING JUST--

10:27.211 --> 10:29.100
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOU'RE AFRAID

10:29.167 --> 10:30.600
TO HAVE NED GET INVOLVED
WITH GHOSTS,

10:30.667 --> 10:31.867
THEN I UNDERSTAND.

10:31.933 --> 10:34.652
IT'S NOT THE GHOST
I'M AFRAID OF.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.671
WHAT IS IT, THEN?

10:36.706 --> 10:39.000
NOTHING. I'M NOT
AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.126
ME, NEITHER.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.003
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:59.038 --> 11:00.988
ARE YOU HERE
WITH YOUR FRIEND?
NO.

11:01.023 --> 11:02.685
I JUST--I DIDN'T
MEAN TO BOTHER YOU.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.719
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK.

11:03.754 --> 11:05.732
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.537
UM...

11:08.072 --> 11:11.116
I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN THE BEST MOOD LATELY.

11:11.151 --> 11:13.320
I SHOULD GET GOING,
ANYWAY.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.834
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOMA

11:19.347 --> 11:21.184
I SHOULDN'T HAVE...
SAID ANYTHING.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.999
NO, IT'S OK.
IT'S...MESSED UP

11:26.234 --> 11:27.849
HOW YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT PEOPLE TO BRING IT UP,

11:27.901 --> 11:30.381
AND THEN, IF THEY DON'T,

11:30.416 --> 11:34.290
IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY'S
ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.178
WERE YOU TWO
REALLY CLOSE?

11:37.213 --> 11:39.330
HE'S MY BIG BROTHER.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.600
WE WERE THE ONLY 2 KIDS
IN OUR FAMILY.

11:41.615 --> 11:42.567
HE ALWAYS LOOKED OUT FOR ME.

11:42.634 --> 11:45.432
SOMETIMES MORE
THAN I WANTED HIM TO.

11:45.467 --> 11:48.911
YEAH. I GOT A MOM
WHO'S LIKE THAT.

11:49.841 --> 11:51.774
JUST, I...

11:51.809 --> 11:55.013
MISS HIM SO MUCH
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.403
AND ALL THIS STRANGE STUFF'S
HAPPENING,

11:56.467 --> 12:00.300
AND MAKING IT
SO MUCH WORSE.

12:00.367 --> 12:02.485
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.133
OK, THIS IS GONNA
SOUND WEIRD.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.801
REALLY WEI, BUT I
CAN'T THINK OF A NOT
WEIRD WAY TO SAY IT,

12:08.867 --> 12:11.033
SO I'M JUST GONNA
SAY IT.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.773
I BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.369
AND IF YOU GO WITH ME,
JUST FOR A MINUTE,

12:17.404 --> 12:19.958
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE
HOW YOU WON'T HAVE
TO MISS THOMAS SO MUCH.

12:19.993 --> 12:21.416
PLUS, IT CAN
HELP EXPLAIN

12:21.433 --> 12:24.703
ALL THE STRANGE THINGS
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.167
THE SCOREBOARD,
THE BLEACHERS,

12:26.233 --> 12:27.467
THE BAT IN KRISTA'S CAR.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.667
THE BAT WAS JUST SOMEBODY'S
BAD IDEA OF A JOKE.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.200
EVERYBODY KNEW
THOMAS WAS INTO BATS.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.667
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

12:32.734 --> 12:34.667
OK, WAIT, WHAT--
WHAT IS THIS?

12:34.734 --> 12:36.561
IS THERE A CAMERA SOMEWHERE?
ARE YOU GONNA POST

12:36.606 --> 12:37.734
THIS WHOLE LITTLE TALK
ON YOUR SLAM BOOK?

12:38.728 --> 12:40.325
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.681
JUST DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT MY BROTHER AGAIN.

12:42.716 --> 12:45.440
STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!

12:49.500 --> 12:51.593
THESE KIDS MUST SPEND
HALF THEIR WAKING HOURS

12:51.628 --> 12:53.998
SLAMMING EACH OTHER ONLINE,
AND NOBODY'S IMMUNE.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.600
THAT'S ONE OF THE
POPULAR GIRLS, RIGHT?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.434
TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT
SUCH A BLESSING ANYMORE.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.667
I GUESS IT PAYS
TO BE ANONYMOUS
ON THE INTERNET.

12:59.734 --> 13:01.834
YEAH. BEING ANONYMOUS
IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.

13:01.901 --> 13:03.500
THESE KIDS SAY THINGS
UNDER THE COVER
OF A SCREEN NAME

13:03.567 --> 13:05.901
THAT THEY WOULD NEVER
HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY
TO SOMEONE'S FACE.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.367
HERE WE GO.

13:07.434 --> 13:10.367
A SLAM ON KRISTA
KEEPS IT CONCISE
AND TO THE POINT.

13:10.434 --> 13:13.033
"LIAR. TWO-FACED.
PHONY. BITCH."

13:13.100 --> 13:16.558
ANYONE WHO SLEEPS
WITH KRISTA BETTER
GET TESTED."

13:16.593 --> 13:17.656
"YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.742
DON'T FORGET
THE RABIES VACCINE."

13:19.777 --> 13:21.088
WOW. RABIES.

13:21.123 --> 13:23.244
GETTIN' SLAMMED ALREADY
FOR HAVING A BAT
IN HER CAR.

13:23.279 --> 13:25.434
NEWS TRAVELS FAST
ON THE INTERNET.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.600
YEAH, EXCEPT THIS WAS
POSTED LAST MONTH,

13:29.667 --> 13:31.368
BEFORE THOMAS DIED.

13:31.403 --> 13:33.100
AND THERE'S A FEW MORE
MENTIONS OF RABIES

13:33.167 --> 13:36.243
GOING BACK EN FURTHER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WONDER...

13:42.367 --> 13:43.322
WHAT'S THAT?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.150
KRISTA'S SCHOOL FACE PAGE.

13:45.169 --> 13:47.000
LOOK AT THE CAPTION.

13:47.066 --> 13:50.133
"HERE'S ME WITH
A BAT HOUSE I BUILT
WITH MY DAD."

13:50.200 --> 13:51.028
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I'M WRONG,

13:51.034 --> 13:52.237
BUT I'M GUESSING
BAT LOVERS UNITED

13:52.250 --> 13:54.534
IS A VERY SMALL CLUB.

13:54.569 --> 13:57.691
MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT ELSE
THEY HAD IN COMMON.

14:02.233 --> 14:05.467
Krista: I CAN'T
HANDLE THIS ANYMORE.

14:22.812 --> 14:25.090
"IT'S OK, BRAD'S
TOTALLY CLUELESS.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.667
"I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
I TELL HIM ANYWAY?

14:26.734 --> 14:30.013
I'M CRAZY ABOUT SOMEONE
WHO WON'T EVEN GIVE ME
THEIR NAME."

14:30.048 --> 14:31.634
SIGNED KRISTA?

14:38.200 --> 14:43.767
Krista: I CAN EXPLAIN.
BRAD.

14:45.996 --> 14:48.469
AND THAT WAS SENT
TO EVERY KID AT SCHOOL
AT THE SAME TIME?

14:48.504 --> 14:50.285
Ned: YEAH, HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.485
WELL, IF I HAD TO GUESS,
I'D GUESS GHOST.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.467
SO WHAT NOW?

14:53.534 --> 14:54.598
WELL, IT SEEMS TO IMPLY

14:54.601 --> 14:56.100
THAT KRISTA WAS CHEATING
ON HER BOYFRIEND BRAD.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.635
MAYBE HE KNEW
ABOUT IT.

14:57.670 --> 14:58.867
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO BRAD.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.600
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.567
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

15:10.173 --> 15:11.115
NED.

15:11.150 --> 15:11.901
HEY.
HEY.

15:13.100 --> 15:13.600
WHERE IS HE?

15:13.667 --> 15:15.300
YEAH, PRACTICE JUST ENDED.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.700
I TOLD HIM TO MEET YOU
IN THE TEAM MEETING ROOM.

15:17.767 --> 15:18.767
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:06.568 --> 16:08.834
THOMAS BENJAMIN
HAD CHALK ON HIM
WHEN HE DIED.

16:10.734 --> 16:13.574
HE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH SOMETHING.

16:13.609 --> 16:16.500
I'M GUESSING
IT WAS THIS BOARD.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.094
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PUSHED HIM INTO IT.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.045
BRAD, I DON'T WORK FOR THE SCHOOL
OR THE POLICE

16:28.100 --> 16:28.600
I'M JUST TRYING

16:28.600 --> 16:31.534
TO HELP THOMAS
AND HIS FAMILY
GET SOME PEACE.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.300
AND YOU, TOO.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.567
BUT YOU HAVE
TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:36.634 --> 16:39.901
KRISTA HAD BEEN
ACTING STRANGE FOR WEEKS.

16:39.967 --> 16:42.019
I MEAN, WE SPE
ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER,

16:42.034 --> 16:45.901
BUT SHE WAS SORTA...
CHECKED OUT.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.634
SHE WAS ALWAYS ONLINE
IMing HER FRIENDS.

16:51.501 --> 16:52.374
HEY.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.320
HERE'S A TIP--

16:54.600 --> 16:59.200
WHEN YOUR GIRLFRIEND STARTS
CLOSING YOUR CELL PHONE
AROUND YOU, IT'S OVER.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.627
I REALLY LIKE KRISTA,

17:01.667 --> 17:05.034
AND I JUST--
I DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE HER.

17:05.101 --> 17:07.534
I HAD TO KNOW
WHO SHE WAS SEEING.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.499
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG,
BUT I READ HER EMAIL.

17:10.534 --> 17:15.000
SOME OF THE STUFF
SHE WAS TELLING THIS GUY
WAS SO INTENSE.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
AND THE WEIRDEST THING WAS,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
E DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO HE WAS.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.445
THEN I DID SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID

17:22.500 --> 17:25.500
THAT I'LL REGRET
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.600
I SENT HIM AN EMAIL
PRETENDING TO BE KRISTA.

17:33.601 --> 17:35.801
I SAID, "LET'S MEET."

17:35.867 --> 17:38.634
SO YOU ARRANGED
TO MEET HIM HERE?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.000
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHO THE GUY WAS.

17:42.034 --> 17:44.896
I HAD A RIGHT
TO FACE MY COMPETITION,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.534
TELL HIM WHAT KRISTA
MEANT TO ME.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.300
THEN THERE WAS THOMAS.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.967
GUANO BOY.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.728
Brad: I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT.

18:04.728 --> 18:05.725
WHERE'S KRISTA?

18:05.725 --> 18:07.178
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

18:07.178 --> 18:08.253
I SENT THE INVITE.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.740
YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.056
LOOK, MAN,
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.805
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU, MAN.

18:12.805 --> 18:13.856
YOU GOTTA HEAR ME OUT, MAN!

18:13.856 --> 18:15.322
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE BLINDSIDED ME.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.233
[BOTH YELLING]

18:20.234 --> 18:23.400
OW!

18:25.901 --> 18:28.101
ARE YOU OK, MAN?

18:28.517 --> 18:31.734
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU CARE, MAN?!
GET OFF ME!

18:37.000 --> 18:40.834
Brad: AND THAT WAS IT,
I SWEAR.

18:40.901 --> 18:43.963
HE SEEMED FINE
THAT NIGHT WHEN HE LEFT.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.702
WHAT ABOUT KRISTA?

18:45.702 --> 18:48.130
HOW DOES SHE FEEL
ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

18:48.634 --> 18:50.456
LIKE I TOLD THOMAS--

18:50.700 --> 18:54.634
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I SENT THE EMAIL
ARRANGING THE MEETING.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.001
IT'S ME WHO'S TO BLAME.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.157
QUITE AN ENTRANCE.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.692
JUST SOME FRIENDS
FROM A PREVIOUS LIFE.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.119
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY CAN SEE ME.

19:45.234 --> 19:48.500
THEN AGAIN, I DON'KNOW WHY
YOU CAN SEE ME, EITHER.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.396
BRAD TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED
THE NIGHT YOU DIED.

19:51.396 --> 19:53.526
DID HE MENTIONED THE PART
WHERE HE KILLED ME?

19:53.526 --> 19:56.339
HE SAID THAT YOU
THREW THE FIRST PUNCH,

19:56.500 --> 19:59.057
AND THAT HE THOUGHT
YOU WERE OK AND IT WAS
ALL AN ACCIDENT.

19:59.067 --> 19:59.768
WHAT IF IT WAS?

19:59.768 --> 20:01.982
WHEN I LEFT HIM, HE WAS
WITH THE PRINCIPAL,

20:01.982 --> 20:04.081
CONFESSING EVERYTHING
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

20:04.081 --> 20:05.609
HE FEELS TERRIBLE.

20:05.609 --> 20:06.872
OK, IT WAS ALL
AN ACCIDENT

20:06.872 --> 20:09.760
AND YOU HAVE
TO FORGIVE THEM
AND GO INTO THE LIGHT.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.356
FORGIVE THEM? WHY?

20:11.356 --> 20:12.465
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'RE DOING,

20:12.465 --> 20:14.367
ALL THESE THINGS
YOU'RE TRYING TO
PUNISH THEM WITH,

20:14.367 --> 20:16.106
THESE HAUNTINGS,
IT'S JUST HURTING
YOUR SISTER.

20:16.106 --> 20:18.307
SHE'S GETTING BLAMED
FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO.

20:18.307 --> 20:20.734
WHO'S BLAMING LUCY?

20:20.801 --> 20:21.851
IS IT THE SLAM BOOK?

20:21.851 --> 20:24.168
YOU KNOW HOW
THEY TREAT ANYONE
WHO'S DIFFERENT.

20:24.168 --> 20:26.297
NO, THE POLICE.
OK, THE SCHOOL.

20:26.297 --> 20:27.931
YOU WERE THERE
WHEN THEY WERE
QUESTIONING HER.

20:29.333 --> 20:29.923
WELL, THEY SHOULDN'T BE
QUESTIONING LUCY.

20:29.923 --> 20:31.346
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

20:31.346 --> 20:32.571
THEY SHOULD JUST
LEAVE HER ALONE.

20:32.571 --> 20:33.786
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
DOING ALL THIS,

20:33.786 --> 20:35.750
BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER?

20:35.750 --> 20:36.781
I ALWAYS HAVE.

20:36.781 --> 20:39.062
I'M HER BROTHER.
I'VE GOT HER SIX.

20:39.062 --> 20:42.489
THOMAS, PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE
PROTECTING HER FROM.

20:42.489 --> 20:43.471
I CAN HELP YOU.

20:43.471 --> 20:45.707
NO, YOU CAN'T.
NO ONE CAN.

20:45.707 --> 20:46.820
BUT IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME,

20:46.820 --> 20:47.951
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO FIND OUT MYSELF,

20:47.951 --> 20:49.232
AND WHAT IF
I'M TOO LATE?

20:49.232 --> 20:51.139
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER.
I'M WARNING YOU.

20:51.139 --> 20:52.726
WHY WON'T YOU LET ME
HELP HER?

20:52.726 --> 20:54.451
WE ALL GOT OUR SECRETS.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.112
INCLUDING YOU.

21:11.801 --> 21:13.901
Melinda: LUCY?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.356
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

21:16.356 --> 21:17.725
TALK IF YOU WANT.

21:17.725 --> 21:21.161
I KNOW NED TOLD YOU
HE BELIEVES IN GHOSTS.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.373
I REALLY WISH
HE HADN'T DONE THAT,

21:23.373 --> 21:25.693
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
DO YOU ANY GOOD
UNLESS I CAN PROVE IT.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.942
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
PROVE IT TO ME?

21:27.950 --> 21:29.451
I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

21:29.451 --> 21:31.197
BUT I THINK YOU
ALREADY KNOW.

21:31.197 --> 21:32.261
REALLY? HOW'S THAT?

21:32.261 --> 21:34.750
I THINK YOU'VE FELT
HIS PRESENCE.

21:34.750 --> 21:38.611
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE WEIRD THINGS
THAT KEEP HAPPENING.

21:39.602 --> 21:43.298
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY THOMAS NEEDS
TO HAVE YOUR SIX.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.050
WHAT?

21:44.634 --> 21:45.410
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT,

21:45.500 --> 21:46.435
SO I LOOKED IT UP,

21:46.435 --> 21:49.291
AND IT'S WHAT
A FIGHTER PILOT
SAYS TO ANOTHER

21:49.291 --> 21:52.463
WHEN HE'S COVERING HIS TAIL,
"I'VE GOT YOUR SIX."

21:53.401 --> 21:54.766
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THOMAS SAID THAT?

21:54.766 --> 21:56.576
BECAUSE HE SAID IT
TO ME.

21:57.313 --> 21:58.417
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

21:58.417 --> 22:01.732
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
IT IS THAT THOMAS IS
PROTECTING YOU FROM.

22:01.732 --> 22:03.755
WHY HE IS SO MAD
AT BRAD AND KRISTA,

22:03.755 --> 22:06.429
SO THAT I CAN GET HIM
INTO THE LIGHT
WHERE HE BELONGS.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.635
LUCY, PLEASE.
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED

22:10.635 --> 22:12.642
BETWEEN HIM AND KRISTA.
WERE THEY SEEING EACH OTHER?

22:12.642 --> 22:15.084
DID HE SEND THOSE EMAILS?

22:33.400 --> 22:36.068
HI. JUSTIN YATES.

22:36.134 --> 22:37.179
JUSTIN WHO?

22:37.179 --> 22:38.858
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.236
YEAH, WHY WOULD YOU.

22:40.434 --> 22:43.947
UM, OK, UH, BLOGGER?
IN SHAME OF THE DEVIL?

22:43.947 --> 22:47.394
WE MET AFTER YOU WON
THAT PLAQUE FROM THE TOWN
FOR, UH, SAVING THOSE KIDS.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.837
OK, SMILE.

22:56.267 --> 22:57.934
OH.

22:58.001 --> 22:58.939
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:58.939 --> 23:02.769
WELL, I GOT THIS
REALLY STRANGE EMAIL
A FEW HOURS AGO.

23:02.769 --> 23:03.652
OK.

23:03.652 --> 23:05.619
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
POST IT ON YOUR BLOG

23:05.619 --> 23:07.914
AND I'LL READ IT
WHEN I GET A CHANCE.

23:07.914 --> 23:10.924
I KNOW MY BLOG
ISN'T EXACTLY CNN.COM.

23:10.924 --> 23:13.938
BUT A LOT OF YOUR FRIENDS
AND A LOT OF YOUR CUSTOMERS
PROBABLY CHECK IT OUT.

23:13.938 --> 23:15.692
AND YOU KNOW HOW
THE INTERNET IS.

23:15.692 --> 23:18.399
ONCE SOMETHING
STARTS TO SPREAD...

23:18.400 --> 23:19.514
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:19.534 --> 23:22.367
HERE. I'LL SHOW YOU.

23:30.501 --> 23:34.900
THIS IS A VIDEO OF ME
REHEARSING A FIGHT
I HAD WITH MY HUSBAND.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.491
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
SAY THAT.

23:36.491 --> 23:37.581
UH, THE ONE PROBLEM IS,

23:37.581 --> 23:40.911
THE VIDEO MADE MY HAMSTER
JUMP ON THE WHEEL, YOU KNOW?

23:40.911 --> 23:43.340
AND, UH, REMEMBERED
THESE FILES

23:43.340 --> 23:46.612
I KIND OF BORROWED
FROM PROFESSOR PAYNE
A WHILE BACK.

23:49.565 --> 23:50.383
THEY WERE ENCRYPTED,

23:50.383 --> 23:52.430
AND I'D GIVEN UP
ON TRYING TO DECODE THEM

23:52.430 --> 23:54.431
UNTIL TONIGHT.

23:54.431 --> 23:56.342
WHAT'S IN THE FILES,
JUSTIN?

23:56.342 --> 23:57.995
IN A NUTSHELL?

23:57.995 --> 24:00.032
YOU SEE GHOSTS.

24:00.032 --> 24:02.062
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT?

24:02.062 --> 24:03.866
NOT SO MUCH, REALLY,
UNTIL I NOTICED

24:03.866 --> 24:06.751
SOMETHING ABOUT THE EMAIL
THAT THE VIDEO
WAS ATTACHED TO.

24:06.751 --> 24:10.506
WHOEVER SENT ME THIS CLIP,
THEIR COMPUTER DOESN'T HAVE
AN IP ADDRESS.

24:10.506 --> 24:12.984
AND IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.595
NOT IN THIS WORLD,
AT LEAST.

24:14.595 --> 24:15.965
THE WORLD OF THE LIVING.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.834
WAIT A MINUTE, UM...

24:19.901 --> 24:21.443
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT, EXACTLY?

24:21.443 --> 24:23.030
WELL, IN MY BUSINESS,

24:23.030 --> 24:25.753
USUALLY WHEN SOMEONE
SENDS THIS KIND OF MESSAGE,

24:25.753 --> 24:27.393
SOMEONE WANTS YOU
TO STOP LOOKING

24:27.393 --> 24:28.929
WHEREVER IT IS YOU'RE LOOKING.

24:28.929 --> 24:30.409
SO YOU JUST WANTED
TO GIVE ME A WARNING?

24:30.409 --> 24:33.675
YEAH, AND, UH, MAYBE A LITTLE
PROFESSIONAL COURTESY,

24:33.675 --> 24:36.604
IN CASE YOU FIND ANYTHING
INTERESTING YOU WANT TO SHARE.

24:36.604 --> 24:38.247
WELL, THANKS...

24:38.247 --> 24:39.770
FOR THE WARNING.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.806
GOOD NIGHT.

24:48.301 --> 24:49.793
YOU'RE WELCOME

24:51.800 --> 24:53.368
GUILTY, GUILTY,
I'M GUILTY!

24:53.433 --> 24:55.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
I TOLD YOU I'M GUILTY!

24:55.134 --> 24:56.368
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

24:56.433 --> 24:58.167
KEEPING RECORDS
OF THINGS THAT
I SAID TO YOU,

24:58.234 --> 25:00.867
THINGS THAT I TOLD YOU
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT YOU COULD BE TRUSTED.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.467
AND DON'T EVEN TELL ME
THAT THEY WERE ENCRYPTED,

25:02.533 --> 25:05.050
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
HOW LITTLE THAT'S WORTH.

25:05.050 --> 25:05.567
ALL RIGHT, THINK BACK.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.666
YOU COME TO ME,
I DON'T KNOW YOU
FROM ADAM.

25:07.701 --> 25:09.958
AND ALL THE THINGS
THAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING
AND WONDERING ABOUT,

25:09.993 --> 25:11.515
AND BETWEEN YOU AND I,
STARTING TO DOUBT,

25:11.516 --> 25:12.167
ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY'RE REAL?!

25:12.234 --> 25:13.433
BUT WHY WRITE IT DOWN?

25:13.500 --> 25:15.967
[SIGHS] LOOK, BECAUSE
IT WAS SO AMAZING,

25:16.034 --> 25:17.656
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
I WASN'T DREAMING IT!

25:17.691 --> 25:18.892
THIS WAS HUGE STUFF!

25:18.927 --> 25:19.634
FOR YOU,
IT'S AN OLD HAT,

25:19.700 --> 25:21.628
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET
THAT I'M AN ACADEMIC,

25:21.663 --> 25:23.301
AND YOU'RE SWEET,
KIND, CARING,

25:23.368 --> 25:24.970
FORGIVING MELINDA,
RIGHT?

25:25.005 --> 25:26.714
DON'T I HAVE AN
OBLIGATION AS MY JOB

25:26.749 --> 25:28.931
TO WRITE DOWN
WHAT I OBSERVE?

25:29.233 --> 25:30.613
REMEMBER, YOU'RE--

25:30.648 --> 25:32.734
YOU'RE SWEET, KIND,
FORGIVING MELINDA.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.101
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS COULD DO
TO MY LIFE?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.939
OH, COME ON, MELINDA!
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

25:37.974 --> 25:39.800
EVERYONE YOU HELP,
THEY ALREADY KNOW
THAT YOU SEE GHOSTS!

25:39.867 --> 25:41.802
I AM AFRAID
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

25:41.837 --> 25:42.934
OF BECOMING A CASE STUDY

25:43.001 --> 25:44.201
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN
UNDERSTAND THINGS

25:44.268 --> 25:45.700
THAT CAN'T BE
UNDERSTOOD.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.134
AND WHILE I'M UNDER
THAT MICROSCOPE,

25:47.201 --> 25:49.491
I CAN'T EVEN HELP
THE SPIRITS THAT
ACTUALLY NEED ME.

25:49.526 --> 25:51.332
YOU'VE REALLY
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH,
HAVEN'T YOU?

25:51.367 --> 25:53.713
MY WHOLE LIFE.

25:56.236 --> 25:57.625
HEY, NED,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:57.660 --> 25:58.810
IS THAT NED?
TELL HIM I'M HERE.

25:58.845 --> 26:00.315
IT'S PROFESSOR PAYNE, NED.
PUT ME ON--

26:00.600 --> 26:02.101
NED, COULD YOU PLEASE
SAY THAT AGAIN,

26:02.167 --> 26:04.734
BECAUSE I HAD
SOMEONE VERY ANNOYING
DISTRACTING ME.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.467
Ned: LUCY JUST TOLD THE SCHOOL
SHE DID ALL THOSE HAUNTINGS.

26:07.533 --> 26:08.934
THE SCOREBOARD,
THE BLEACHERS,

26:09.001 --> 26:11.301
THE BAT IN KRISTA'S CAR,
EVERYTHING.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.176
WHAT? WHY WOULD
SHE DO THAT?

26:13.211 --> 26:15.000
IT'S LIKE SHE'S TRYING
TO PROTECT THOMAS.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.415
THOMAS IS A GHOST.
WHAT IS SHE PROTECTING HIM
FROM, PURGATORY?

26:17.450 --> 26:20.268
WAIT, WILL YOU JUST
CALL ME BACK IF YOU GET
ANYTHING ELSE? BYE.

26:20.949 --> 26:21.937
I DON'T GET IT.

26:21.972 --> 26:23.467
THOMAS SAYS THAT
HE'S PROTECTING HER,

26:23.502 --> 26:25.085
SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE'S PROTECTING HIM.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.364
WHAT ARE THEY PROTECTING
EACH OTHER FROM?

26:27.399 --> 26:28.253
HAVE YOU ASKED KRISTA?

26:28.288 --> 26:30.324
NO. SHE WON'T RETURN
MY PHONE CALLS.

26:30.367 --> 26:31.667
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
EVER SINCE BRAD CONFESSED,

26:31.734 --> 26:34.191
MAYBE SHE HAS
A LOT LESS TO HIDE.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.657
HI, KRISTA,
I'M MELINDA.

26:39.692 --> 26:40.811
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

26:40.846 --> 26:43.606
UM, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU.

26:43.641 --> 26:46.739
WOW. DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
ZERO COMPREHENSION
OF THE WORD "NO?"

26:46.774 --> 26:48.774
I DO, BUT DID THOMAS?

26:48.809 --> 26:49.642
THOMAS?

26:49.712 --> 26:51.101
YEAH, I'M NOT TRYING TO
BLAME YOU FOR ANYTHING.

26:51.167 --> 26:53.236
I MEAN, I'M SURE
IF YOU HURT
THOMAS' FEELINGS,

26:53.271 --> 26:54.045
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.903
NO, I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO THOMAS.

26:56.938 --> 26:59.195
OK, WE HAD A COUPLE
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BATS.

26:59.230 --> 26:59.813
THAT'S IT.

26:59.848 --> 27:01.254
WELL, YOU WERE
WRITING TO EACH OTHER.

27:01.289 --> 27:03.307
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
WERE INVOLVED.

27:03.342 --> 27:05.497
I MEAN,
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
GOT THAT EMAIL.

27:05.532 --> 27:08.018
NO, THOSE EMAILS
WEREN'T FROM THOMAS, OK?

27:08.053 --> 27:09.846
SO JUST DROP IT.

27:09.881 --> 27:11.062
WELL, HOW CAN YOU
BE SO SURE?

27:11.097 --> 27:13.044
THEY WEREN'T EVEN
SIGNED.

27:13.079 --> 27:16.129
BECAUSE, I'VE WRITTEN BACK
SINCE HE DIED,

27:16.164 --> 27:17.205
AND...

27:17.240 --> 27:18.584
I HAVEN'T GOT A RESPONSE YET,

27:18.619 --> 27:20.896
BUT WHOEVER WAS WRITING ME
OPENED THEM.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.365
SO IF THOMAS WASN'T
WRITING THEM, THEN WHO?

27:23.365 --> 27:24.916
I DON'T KNOW!

27:24.951 --> 27:26.664
I GOTTA GO.

27:29.569 --> 27:32.352
WAIT A MINUTE.
SO KRISTA'S PROTECTING
THOMAS, TOO?

27:32.387 --> 27:34.143
PROTECTING OR STONEWALLING.

27:34.178 --> 27:36.932
SHE'S INSISTING THOSE EMAILS
WERE NOT FROM HIM.

27:36.967 --> 27:38.605
OR MAYBE SHE'S JUST
EMBARRASSED

27:38.689 --> 27:41.457
THAT SHE WAS CHEATING
ON HER BOYFRIEND
WITH GUANO BOY.

27:41.492 --> 27:43.242
I'M NOT CALLING NAMES.

27:43.277 --> 27:46.209
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE.
HIGH SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE.

27:46.244 --> 27:48.300
SO ASSUMING THAT KRISTA
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

27:48.334 --> 27:50.961
AND IF HE WASN'T
WRITING THOSE EMAILS,
WHO WAS?

27:50.996 --> 27:55.694
MAYBE THERE'S SOME CLUE
TO WHO SENT THEM
IN THE EMAILS.

27:56.906 --> 27:58.091
YOU'RE RIGHT!

27:58.126 --> 27:59.539
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DO.

27:59.574 --> 28:00.877
DO YOU STILL HAVE
THAT EMAIL
ON YOUR PHONE?

28:00.912 --> 28:02.600
THE ONE THE GHOST
WAS TEXTING EVERYONE?

28:02.667 --> 28:04.301
YEAH, BUT IT DIDN'T SAY MUCH.
THAT'S OK.

28:04.368 --> 28:05.734
LITTLE BLOGGER
FRIEND OF MINE

28:05.800 --> 28:07.834
TAUGHT ME THAT ONE
IS ALL IT TAKES.

28:12.601 --> 28:15.544
PROFESSOR RICK PAYNE
IN APOLOGETIC SERVITUDE.

28:15.579 --> 28:16.170
Melinda: GOOD.

28:16.205 --> 28:17.514
I'M GONNA FORWARD YOU
AN EMAIL,

28:17.549 --> 28:18.867
AND I NEED YOU
TO USE THE IP ADDRESS

28:18.934 --> 28:21.433
TO TRACK DOWN THE LOCATION
OF THE COMPUTER THAT
ORIGINALLY SENT THEN.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.172
CAN YOU DO THAT?
SURE.

28:23.207 --> 28:25.268
YEAH, I MEAN I KNOW A GEEK
WHO KNOWS A GEEK.

28:25.334 --> 28:26.800
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

28:28.234 --> 28:30.061
REMEMBER TO TELL
YOUR MOM

28:30.133 --> 28:32.533
THAT WE DID NOT SPEND
THE WHOLE EVENING
TALKING ABOUT GHOSTS.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.641
I HELPED YOU WITH
YOUR HOMEWORK, TOO.

28:34.676 --> 28:36.532
YEAH, THAT WAS INTENSE.

28:36.567 --> 28:39.638
HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT
MEASURING VOLUMES AND PLANES.

28:40.091 --> 28:40.400
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
HELLO?

28:40.467 --> 28:41.879
Rick: ALL RIGHT,
I CAN GET YOU

28:41.880 --> 28:44.132
THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
AND THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS

28:44.167 --> 28:46.136
OF THE COMPUTER'S LOCATION.
NO USER NAME, THOUGH.

28:46.171 --> 28:48.430
I WOULD NEED
A COURT ORDER FOR THAT.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.787
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE ALREADY
GOT THE ADDRESS?

28:49.822 --> 28:50.974
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

28:51.009 --> 28:53.888
UH, YEAH. OK,
WRITE THIS DOWN.

29:13.530 --> 29:16.768
SO WHOEVER ANSWERS THE DOOR
SENT THOSE EMAILS TO KRISTA?

29:16.803 --> 29:19.551
I FEEL FOR HIM,
WHOEVER HE IS.

29:23.234 --> 29:24.867
HI.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.167
LUCY?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.110
YEAH, THIS IS
MY HOUSE.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.067
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE?

29:33.427 --> 29:35.691
NOT ANY MORE

29:37.500 --> 29:39.746
NOW'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

29:39.781 --> 29:42.066
LUCY? WHO IS IT?

29:43.208 --> 29:44.528
DAD, THIS IS
NED AND MELINDA.

29:44.563 --> 29:46.667
THEY'RE...FROM SCHOOL.

29:48.772 --> 29:50.922
WHY DON'T YOU
COME INSIDE?

29:54.264 --> 29:55.743
UM, WE'RE SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

29:55.778 --> 29:58.762
WE WERE JUST HOPING
THAT WE COULD TALK TO
LUCY FOR A FEW MINUTES.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.931
WHAT ABOUT?

30:01.339 --> 30:03.594
THIS IS
MY WIFE JILL.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.605
THIS IS MELINDA
AND--

30:04.640 --> 30:06.488
NED. HI.
HI.

30:06.523 --> 30:08.756
IS THIS ABOUT THE TROUBLE
LUCY'S IN?

30:08.791 --> 30:10.549
IN A WAY.

30:10.584 --> 30:12.763
IT'S OK. I CAN TALK TO THEM.
WE'LL JUST GO OUTSIDE.

30:12.798 --> 30:14.076
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO, HONEY.

30:14.105 --> 30:16.513
OUR DAUGHTER'S
ALL BUT BEEN BRANDED
A SERIAL KILLER

30:16.548 --> 30:18.411
BECAUSE SOME KIDS
REPROGRAMMED
THE SCOREBOARD.

30:18.446 --> 30:19.321
DAD...

30:19.356 --> 30:21.057
I DON'T BELIEVE
FOR A SECOND
YOU DID THAT.

30:21.059 --> 30:23.731
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU TOLD THE POLICE
OR YOUR TEACHERS.

30:24.512 --> 30:27.360
WELL, I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT LUCY'S INNOCENT, ALSO.

30:28.503 --> 30:30.132
IN FACT, I KNOW IT.

30:31.309 --> 30:33.795
WHY DON'T WE ALL
SIT DOWN?

30:37.532 --> 30:39.931
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

30:39.966 --> 30:42.558
IT'S ABOUT
THE LETTERS YOU WROTE.

30:42.593 --> 30:43.714
EMAILS, ACTUALLY.

30:43.749 --> 30:48.576
THE ONES YOU WROTE
TO THAT KID YOU LIKE.

30:48.611 --> 30:49.489
THAT KID?

30:49.524 --> 30:52.188
THERE'S THIS GIRL
I WAS INTO.

30:55.304 --> 30:57.217
IF YOU'RE HERE
AS SOMEONE CONCERNED

30:57.222 --> 30:59.054
ABOUT SOME INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIPS--

30:59.089 --> 31:02.000
NO, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE JUST HERE AS FRIENDS.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.678
THEY'RE HERE
BECAUSE OF THOMAS.

31:03.713 --> 31:05.008
BECAUSE HE WASN'T
OK WITH IT.

31:05.043 --> 31:06.819
NOT REALLY...ANYWAY.

31:06.854 --> 31:08.599
LUCY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:08.634 --> 31:10.525
THE NIGHT THOMAS DIED.

31:11.107 --> 31:12.136
"MEET ME AT 8:00.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.414
"IF YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT, FORGET IT.

31:13.444 --> 31:15.626
I'VE WAITED
TOO LONG."
SIGNED KRISTA.

31:15.626 --> 31:17.165
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

31:17.200 --> 31:18.129
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

31:18.164 --> 31:20.075
YOU SAVED IT ON THE HARD DRIVE.
THE HARD DRIVE THAT WE SHARE.

31:20.110 --> 31:20.712
IT'S PRIVATE.

31:20.747 --> 31:21.988
KRISTA EISENBERG.

31:22.023 --> 31:25.018
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL,
SHE'S A SENIOR,

31:25.053 --> 31:27.525
AND, OH, WHAT'S ONE
LITTLE KEY INGREDIENT

31:27.560 --> 31:29.527
MISSING IN YOUR WACKY
LESBIAN FANTASY?

31:29.562 --> 31:30.400
SHE'S NOT GAY.

31:30.467 --> 31:32.688
WE WERE POSTING
ON THE SAME BLOG!

31:32.723 --> 31:34.959
SHE RESPONDED TO ME.
SHE WANTED MY EMAIL,

31:34.994 --> 31:36.040
AND SHE'S THE ONE
WHO KEPT IT GOING.

31:36.075 --> 31:37.331
BUT YOU NEVER TOLD HER
WHO YOU ARE.

31:37.332 --> 31:38.588
YOU NEVER GAVE HER
YOUR NAME.

31:38.623 --> 31:39.534
SHE LIKES ME.

31:39.587 --> 31:41.795
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE'S WRITING TO A GIRL!

31:41.800 --> 31:44.727
I THINK SHE DOES.
OH, WHY?

31:44.762 --> 31:47.463
BECAUSE OF LITTLE THINGS
THAT SHE SAID.

31:47.498 --> 31:48.864
DIFFERENT STUFF
THAT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

31:48.899 --> 31:49.773
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.980
OK? YOU'RE COMITTING
SOCIAL SUICIDE.

31:52.015 --> 31:55.556
ONCE SHE SEES YOU,
SHE'S GONNA REALIZE
THAT YOU TRICKED HER,

31:55.591 --> 31:57.041
AND SHE'S GONNA
BE PISSED.

31:57.076 --> 31:59.184
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME,
SHE CAN TELL ME,

31:59.219 --> 32:00.407
AND I'LL HANDLE IT.
CAN YOU HANDLE

32:00.442 --> 32:02.449
WHAT SHE'S GOING
TO WRITE ABOUT YOU
IN THE SLAM BOOK?

32:02.452 --> 32:03.881
WHAT HER FRIENDS
ARE GOING TO WRITE
ABOUT YOU?

32:03.916 --> 32:04.909
ONCE YOU'RE A TARGET,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.549
EVERYONE'S GONNA
TAKE A SHOT.

32:06.584 --> 32:07.942
PEOPLE THAT DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOU.

32:07.977 --> 32:10.547
THEY'RE GONNA
TERRORIZE YOU
EVERY DAY.

32:10.582 --> 32:12.811
FOR THE REST
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

32:12.846 --> 32:16.886
LUCY, WE HAVE GOT
TO UNDO THIS

32:16.921 --> 32:19.148
BEFORE IT GETS OUT.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.307
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.493
I'LL GO.

32:24.528 --> 32:26.338
OK? I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

32:26.700 --> 32:27.880
OK?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.066
THE WHOLE THING
WAS A SET UP.

32:44.101 --> 32:45.083
FORGET HER.

32:45.118 --> 32:46.704
WHY WOULD KRISTA
DO THAT?

32:46.739 --> 32:47.725
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO KEPT EMAILING.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.626
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO WANTED TO MEET.

32:48.661 --> 32:49.745
WHY WOULD SHE
SEND BRAD?

32:49.780 --> 32:51.733
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE GOT OFF OF

32:51.768 --> 32:54.300
MAKIN' HIM, LIKE...
JEALOUS OR SOMETHING.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.157
OR SHE THOUGHT
THAT, UH, MAYBE...

32:57.300 --> 32:57.953
WHAT?

32:57.988 --> 32:58.774
I DON'T KNOW,

32:58.809 --> 33:01.314
THAT THE WHOLE THING
WAS JUST KIND OF A JOKE.

33:05.181 --> 33:07.282
BUT YOUR BROTHER
WAS LYING TO YOU.

33:07.317 --> 33:09.743
KRISTA NEVER EVEN KNEW
ABOUT THE MEETING.

33:09.778 --> 33:11.548
WHAT?
BRAD NEVER TOLD HER.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.408
HE SENT THAT EMAIL
HIMSELF,

33:13.443 --> 33:15.393
BUT HE NEVER
TOLD KRISTA THAT.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.509
WHY WAS THOMAS
SO MAD AT KRISTA?

33:18.019 --> 33:19.365
BECAUSE...

33:19.386 --> 33:22.907
HE THOUGHT SHE NEVER
MEANT ANYTHING
SHE PUT IN THE EMAILS.

33:22.942 --> 33:26.692
HE WAS SURE YOU WERE
GETTING SET UP.

33:28.342 --> 33:31.092
HE THOUGHT HE WAS
PROTECTING ME.

33:31.127 --> 33:33.196
HE HAD MY SIX.

33:35.005 --> 33:36.964
MOM AND DAD,
I AM SO SORRY.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.410
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LET HIM GO.

33:38.445 --> 33:40.199
OH, BABY.

33:40.234 --> 33:42.042
NO ONE MEANT
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

33:42.077 --> 33:44.214
NO, THE COUNTY IS NOT
CHARGING BRAD,

33:44.299 --> 33:45.481
AND THEY SHOULDN'T.

33:45.516 --> 33:47.088
IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT.

33:47.123 --> 33:49.395
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE
THINGS THAT HAPPENED
AT THE SCHL?

33:49.430 --> 33:51.157
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU DID IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE ANGRY?

33:51.192 --> 33:53.042
NO, YOUR SON WAS.

33:53.077 --> 33:54.644
LUCY TOOK THE BLAME
FOR THOSE THINGS

33:54.679 --> 33:57.951
BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRED
OF EVERYBODY ASKING
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

33:58.523 --> 34:00.641
OK, NOW I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

34:01.785 --> 34:04.220
BUT LUCY NEVER WAS
CONFUSED.

34:04.255 --> 34:06.766
SHE KNEW WHO SHE WAS,
AND WHO SHE LOVED,

34:06.801 --> 34:08.938
AND SHE WASN'T
ASHAMED OF IT.

34:08.974 --> 34:11.110
AND MOM AND DAD
WERE OK WITH THAT.

34:11.145 --> 34:13.984
JUST LIKE THEY WERE OK
WITH ME BEING THE FREAK KID

34:14.018 --> 34:15.812
WHO HUNG OUT
WITH THE BATS ALL DAY.

34:15.847 --> 34:17.527
THOMAS IS HERE.

34:20.150 --> 34:21.547
HIS SPIRIT.

34:22.038 --> 34:23.817
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:23.851 --> 34:28.304
HE SAYS THAT YOU LOVED
BOTH OF YOUR CHILDREN

34:28.339 --> 34:31.402
JUST FOR WHO THEY WERE.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.800
THEY WERE COOL
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

34:34.800 --> 34:37.043
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE NOW,

34:37.078 --> 34:38.601
FOR ANYONE WHO'S DIFFERENT.

34:38.637 --> 34:42.217
THEY TAKE A FEW WORDS
AND, LIKE,OISON
YOUR WHOLE WORLD.

34:42.252 --> 34:44.382
HE'S WORRIED
ABOUT LUCY.

34:44.420 --> 34:47.612
ALL THE DAMAGE THAT
THE INTERNET CAN DO,

34:47.647 --> 34:50.056
SPREADING
CRUEL WORDS AROUND.

34:50.091 --> 34:52.206
I MEAN, LOOK AT MY SISTER.

34:52.241 --> 34:55.978
SHE'S PRETTY, AND SMART,
AND FUNNY.

34:56.013 --> 34:57.483
EVERYONE LIKES HER.

34:57.518 --> 35:00.056
NO ONE HAD TO KNOW
THAT LUCY WAS DIFFERENT.

35:00.105 --> 35:02.661
HE'S SAYING
THAT YOU COULD HAVE
BLENDED IN--

35:02.696 --> 35:03.866
IF YOU WANTED TO.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.993
YOU MEAN IF I CHOSE TO.

35:07.167 --> 35:10.393
IN MY HEART,
I WANTED HER TO CHANGE.

35:10.428 --> 35:14.507
BUT I WAS THE ONE
THAT NEEDED TO CHANGE.

35:14.542 --> 35:17.778
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU,

35:17.813 --> 35:21.799
BUT I REALIZE NOW
THAT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU NEEDED.

35:21.834 --> 35:26.643
WHAT YOU NEEDED WAS ME
TO SEE YOU AND TO LOVE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.914
HE LOVES YOU.

35:35.197 --> 35:36.977
HE ALWAYS DID.

35:37.012 --> 35:41.140
AND HE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO BE ANYTHING
BUT WHO YOU ARE.

35:43.838 --> 35:46.246
I LOVE HIM, TOO.

35:47.784 --> 35:49.283
I LOVE YOU, THOMAS.

35:54.328 --> 35:55.975
COME ON.

36:01.569 --> 36:03.623
DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT?

36:03.658 --> 36:05.014
NOT YET.

36:05.495 --> 36:08.634
I GOT ONE OR TWO THINGS
TO TAKE CARE OF FIRST.

36:40.889 --> 36:42.248
SO NOW THEY THINK SOMEHOW

36:42.300 --> 36:43.752
THAT THE COMPUTER
ON THE SCOREBOARD

36:43.787 --> 36:45.604
LOOPED INTO
THE SCHOOL SERVER,

36:45.639 --> 36:46.989
LIKE IT WAS JUST
SOME WIRES THAT CROSSED,

36:47.024 --> 36:48.756
MESSED EVERYTHING UP.

36:48.791 --> 36:51.519
SO THOMAS SET THINGS RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT.

36:51.554 --> 36:52.602
YEAH.

36:52.637 --> 36:54.361
AND LUCY'S OFF THE HOOK.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.433
EXCUSE ME.

37:00.677 --> 37:04.069
OH, MAN. SHE'S PISSED
ABOUT THE GHOST THING.

37:04.104 --> 37:06.504
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO TALK TO HER?

37:06.539 --> 37:10.098
NO, IT'S OK.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.158
HEY, MOM?

37:23.422 --> 37:24.868
BE MAD AT ME, OK?

37:24.903 --> 37:26.649
NOT MELINDA.

37:28.076 --> 37:30.453
I'M THE ONE
THAT PUSHED HER TO HELP.

37:31.341 --> 37:33.805
I'M NOT MAD
AT ANYBODY.

37:34.526 --> 37:36.688
I'M JUST PROUD OF YOU

37:36.723 --> 37:39.515
FOR WANTING
TO HELP YOUR FRIEND.

37:39.700 --> 37:40.812
LUCY?

37:40.847 --> 37:43.788
SHE'S NOT REALLY MY FRIEND.
SHE CALLED ME "TED."

37:43.823 --> 37:45.548
YOU SEE,
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

37:45.583 --> 37:47.626
YOU DIDN'T CARE WHAT
ANYBODY MIGHT CALL YOU.

37:47.661 --> 37:50.700
YOU STILL STUCK
YOUR NECK OUT ANYWAY.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.019
YOUR SWEET,

37:52.052 --> 37:53.054
BEAUTIFUL NECK.

37:53.153 --> 37:55.974
I USED TO KISS IT
WHEN I PUT YOU TO BED.

37:57.343 --> 38:00.694
THAT WAS JUST
A SECOND AGO, NED.

38:00.729 --> 38:03.665
AND NOW YOU'RE ALL
GROWN UP.

38:04.346 --> 38:06.000
I AM...

38:06.000 --> 38:10.233
SO PROUD OF THE MAN
THAT YOU ARE BECOMING.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.556
Lucy: HEY.

38:22.400 --> 38:22.793
ME?

38:22.828 --> 38:24.463
NED, YEAH, HI.

38:25.754 --> 38:26.953
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:26.988 --> 38:28.974
GOOD. GOOD, YOU KNOW,

38:29.009 --> 38:30.518
SCHOOL, LIFE.

38:32.004 --> 38:35.227
UM, THAT WAS
A COOL THING YOU DID,

38:35.262 --> 38:37.732
TELLING ME ABOUT
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.089
I KNOW I DIDN'T
MAKE IT EASY.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.720
DO YOU WANT TO SIT?

38:42.755 --> 38:45.483
YEAH. YEAH, OK.

38:49.523 --> 38:52.209
SO HAS YOUR FRIEND
SEEN MY BROTHER AROUND?

38:52.244 --> 38:54.631
NO, BUT HE MIGHT
STILL BE HERE.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.913
USUALLY SHE SEES THEM
CROSS OVER.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.706
HEY.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.414
HI.

39:07.395 --> 39:09.234
I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

39:09.695 --> 39:10.867
MY EMAIL?

39:11.796 --> 39:12.630
YEAH?

39:17.341 --> 39:19.209
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME
THAT IT WASN'T FOR ME.

39:19.244 --> 39:20.647
THIS IS WEIRD ENOUGH
ALREADY.

39:20.682 --> 39:24.643
NO, I JUST--I DIDN'T...

39:24.678 --> 39:28.596
DON'T BE SHY.
JUST ADMIT IT.

39:31.573 --> 39:33.898
THE WEB WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.842
WOW.

39:39.465 --> 39:41.527
BUSTED.

39:41.998 --> 39:44.478
THANKS FOR ALL
YOUR EMAILS.

39:44.513 --> 39:46.426
SO YOU KNEW?

39:46.461 --> 39:47.157
NOT FOR SURE.

39:47.192 --> 39:50.434
BUT, UM...
I HOPED.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.176
YOU DID
A GOOD THING.

39:59.069 --> 40:00.943
I WORRY ABOUT HER.

40:00.978 --> 40:02.860
I DON'T.

40:02.895 --> 40:06.628
SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE HAS GOOD FRIENDS.

40:15.976 --> 40:18.649
THE LIGHT...

40:20.383 --> 40:22.555
WHAT'S IT LIKE IN THERE?

40:25.449 --> 40:28.186
I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS.

40:28.221 --> 40:30.613
BUT DON'T GO BY ME.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.917
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO CHECK IT OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

41:03.510 --> 41:04.902
JUSTIN.

41:04.937 --> 41:06.879
OH, UH...

41:06.914 --> 41:08.154
HEY. UM,

41:08.790 --> 41:11.830
I'M NOT STALKING YOU,
I SWEAR.

41:11.865 --> 41:13.289
YOU SAID IT, I DIDN'T.

41:13.308 --> 41:16.775
AHH, DID YOU EVER FIND OUT
WHO EMAILED ME THAT VIDEO
FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA?

41:16.810 --> 41:17.447
NOPE.

41:17.482 --> 41:20.211
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,
NO IP ADDRESS.

41:22.217 --> 41:23.837
YOU GOT YOUR SECRETS,
THAT'S COOL.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.731
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD NOT ASK ABOUT
THE ONES I KNOW ABOUT.

41:26.731 --> 41:29.549
LIKE YOUR TRAVELS
UNDERNEATH THE TOWN.

41:29.584 --> 41:30.424
IN THE TUNNELS

41:30.459 --> 41:34.001
UNDER OUR BELOVED,
PERHAPS HAUNTED, TOWN.

41:34.036 --> 41:35.957
IS THAT PROFESSOR PAYNE'S
THEORY?

41:35.992 --> 41:38.074
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO OUT YOU.

41:38.109 --> 41:40.353
OK, I KNOW WHAT
THAT COULD DO
TO YOUR LIFE.

41:40.388 --> 41:42.254
WHY DOES THIS MEAN
SO MUCH TO YOU?

41:42.289 --> 41:45.107
DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF THING
WITH THE OTHER SIDE?

41:45.744 --> 41:47.265
HMM.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.561
WHEN THE TIME COMES,

41:50.596 --> 41:55.243
JUST REMEMBER,
I KEPT YOUR SECRET.

41:55.278 --> 41:58.542
WHAT TIME IS THAT?

42:06.000 --> 42:09.734
WHEN I CALL IN THE FAVOR

42:09.735 --> 42:13.000
