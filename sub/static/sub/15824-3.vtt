00:02.503 --> 00:06.574
Provenza: YES. UH, YEAH.
UH, UH, UH-HUH.

YEAH. YEAH.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.579
YEP.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.391

00:27.428 --> 00:29.163
Flynn!
What?

00:30.431 --> 00:32.266
What?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
Come on. Come on.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.613
Come here.

00:46.180 --> 00:50.751
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A QUICK 2,000 BUCKS, CASH?

00:50.784 --> 00:52.153
NO, THANKS.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.421
ANYTHING THAT BEGINS
WITH YOU WHISPERING

00:53.454 --> 00:55.323
ALWAYS ENDS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE SHOUTING.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.593
FLYNN, FLYNN, I'M TELLING YOU --
THIS IS FREE MONEY.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.794
THERE'S THIS LAWYER.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.763
HE -- HE HAS
SOME PAPERS TO SERVE,

01:02.796 --> 01:05.366
AND HE JUST NEEDS
A COUPLE OF GREAT DETECTIVES

01:05.399 --> 01:06.367
TO FIND SOME GUY.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.503
AND WHAT DO WE HAVE
TO WORK WITH?

01:09.537 --> 01:12.106
AH, WELL,
A CELLPHONE NUMBER.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.275
BUT WE'VE FOUND PEOPLE
WITH LESS.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.810
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRACK
SOMEONE'S CELLPHONE. DO YOU?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.147
OH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
'NIGHT, LIEUTENANTS.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.281
W-WAIT, WAIT, BUZZ!

01:20.314 --> 01:21.782
WAIT. WAIT. BUZZ --

01:21.815 --> 01:23.217
YOU KNOW...

01:23.251 --> 01:25.519
...WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.723
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A LITTLE EXTRA DOUGH?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.131
TURN RIGHT HERE.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.136
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE
IF YOU'D STAY IN ONE LANE.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.440
AND YOU COULD SPEED UP A LITTLE.
THERE'S A GUY RIGHT BEHIND US.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.775
WOULD YOU RELAX?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.644
FOR USING YOUR CAR
AND TRACKING A CELLPHONE,

01:50.678 --> 01:53.781
WE'RE GIVING YOU
1/3 OF OUR TAKE -- 200 BUCKS.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.551
IS WHAT WE'RE DOING
EVEN LEGAL?

01:57.585 --> 02:01.155
LOOK -- WE'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT,
AND WE'RE DOING IT.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.823
SO THAT MAKES IT LEGAL.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.326
AND THE CHIEF
OKAYED THIS?

02:05.359 --> 02:08.196
WE'LL GET HER SIGNATURE
TOMORROW.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.198
OR MAYBE
WE DON'T EVEN TELL HER.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.865
SHE'S GOT ENOUGH
ON HER MIND.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.536
THESE PAPERS THAT WE GOT
FROM THE ATTORNEY --

02:15.569 --> 02:19.307
THEY SAY THIS GUY'S NAME
IS STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.342
SOUND FAMILIAR, HUH?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.190
OH, THERE YOU GO.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.492
UH, JUST LEAVE IT RIGHT HERE,
WOULD YOU?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.461
SO, WHAT,
ARE YOU BILL GATES NOW?

02:40.494 --> 02:44.398
WHAT'S $20 WHEN YOU'RE
MAKING, UH, $200?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
Man: I GOT THIS ONE.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.542
715.

02:54.575 --> 02:58.312
7-1-- AH!

02:58.346 --> 02:59.847
READY?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.616
Man: WHO IS IT?

03:02.650 --> 03:03.917
ROOM SERVICE.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.820
I DIDN'T ORDER
ANY ROOM SERVICE.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.923
UH, COMPLIMENTARY
CHAMPAGNE, SIR.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.626
OH, WELL,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.696
I

03:15.729 --> 03:17.631
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM,
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.966
WHAT?

03:18.999 --> 03:21.669
THINK WE CAN GET THAT POSE
ONE MORE TIME?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.404
YEAH.
NICE, BIG SMILE.
UH --

03:24.805 --> 03:26.674
OH, NO, GUYS.
UH, YOU THINK I'M SOMEBODY ELSE.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.409
I'M NOT THE GUY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.777
YEAH, WELL,
TELL IT TO THE JUDGE, HUH?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.878
HERE'S ONE FOR YOUR SCRAPBOOK.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.613
OH, NO, NO, NO.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.948
GUYS -- GUYS, YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE, REALLY.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.784
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.453
DON'T GO. I'M SCARED.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.555
Flynn:
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.960
Provenza:
YOU SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS, HUH?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.496
WAS I RIGHT,
OR WAS I RIGHT?

03:48.529 --> 03:49.697
OKAY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.632
NOW LET'S
GO BACK TO THE LAWYER,

03:51.665 --> 03:53.867
GET OUR CASH,
AND JUST CALL IT A NIGHT.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.505
DARN IT.
MY TAILLIGHT -- IT'S BROKEN.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.540
WELL, I DIDN'T DO THAT.
YOU COULD HAVE.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.475
YOU WERE DRIVING
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.377
AND MY INSURANCE
ISN'T GONNA COVER THIS

04:03.411 --> 04:04.812
BECAUSE MY DEDUCTIBLE'S
$1,000.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.414
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DOCUMENTING THIS.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.723
WHAT THE...

04:20.894 --> 04:23.597
IT'S HIM.
HIRSCHBAUM COMMITTED SUICIDE.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.866
SUICIDE?
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.402
HE'S GOT MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS
IN HIS BACK.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.737
OH, MY GOD!
MY CAR!

04:29.770 --> 04:30.871
OH, RELAX, BUZZ.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.606
I KNOW AN AMAZING GUY
IN KOREATOWN.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.409
HE'LL BUFF THIS
RIGHT OUT.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.512
NO! NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T CALL THIS IN.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.847
NOBODY KNOWS WE'RE HERE.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.515
THERE'S A DEAD MAN
ON MY CAR.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.916
WELL, WE DIDN'T
PUT HIM THERE.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.785
OH, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.654
CALL GABRIEL
AND THE GUYS,

04:46.687 --> 04:48.922
BUT THERE IS NO NEED
TO BOTHER THE CHIEF.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.058
THIS IS TOTALLY
CONTAINABLE.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.061
[ POLICE RADIO CHATTER,
SIREN CHIRPS ]

04:56.997 --> 04:58.832
Flynn: HEY, WHAT DID YOU
WANT US TO DO, GABRIEL?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.968
WE'RE OFF-DUTY,
AND WE DON'T HAVE OUR GUNS.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.604
Gabriel: HE FELL FROM UP THERE
DOWN TO HERE?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.606
YEAH, BACK DIVE
AND A HALF-TWIST.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.675
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE

05:07.708 --> 05:09.877
THE RUSSIAN JUDGE
ONLY GAVE HIM AN 8.5?

05:09.910 --> 05:14.081
GABRIEL, GABRIEL, LOOK --
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.516
UM --
"WHAT IS A MURDER VICTIM

05:15.549 --> 05:17.050
DOING ON BUZZ'S CAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE?"

05:17.084 --> 05:19.853
WELL, SIMPLE --
WE WERE TAKING BUZZ TO DINNER,

05:19.887 --> 05:21.389
LIKE WE DO EVERY WEEK.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.624
Flynn: THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE,
THERE WAS SHOTS.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.092
THANK GOD
THE CAR WAS HERE.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.527
COULD YOU IMAGINE
WHAT THIS GUY WOULD LOOK LIKE

05:26.560 --> 05:27.928
IF HE'D LANDED
ON THE PAVEMENT?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.531
OR ON US.
I MEAN, WE COULD ALL BE DEAD.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.701
NO GUNS,
BUT I GOT THREE CASINGS,

05:33.734 --> 05:35.836
A SUBPOENA, A CELLPHONE,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.972
AND AN I.D. BELONGING
TO A STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.808
SO, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE VICTIM AT ALL,

05:40.841 --> 05:43.477
AND THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HIM
IS WHEN HE LANDED ON BUZZ'S CAR?

05:43.511 --> 05:45.413
Sanchez:
HEY, GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.148
OH. GET --

05:55.055 --> 05:57.391
OH. I GUESS
WE DID SEE HIM BEFORE.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.059
WHO'S GONNA
CALL THE CHIEF?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.529
NO ONE. YOU HEAR ME?
NOBODY'S GONNA CALL THE CHIEF!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.931
SHE DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.866
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.
Flynn: OHH.

06:05.899 --> 06:10.404
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN
HOW STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM,

06:10.438 --> 06:13.674
A GUY CONVICTED IN A MASSIVE
FEDERAL FRAUD TRIAL,

06:13.707 --> 06:18.746
ENDS UP DEAD ON BUZZ'S CAR
FIVE DAYS BEFORE HIS SENTENCING?

06:19.813 --> 06:20.848
AGENT HOWARD --

06:20.881 --> 06:22.182
FRITZ --

06:22.215 --> 06:23.517
FRITZIE...

06:24.852 --> 06:26.487
NOW, TELL ME --

06:26.520 --> 06:31.825
WHAT CAN WE DO TO KEEP THIS
JUST BETWEEN OURSELVES?

06:31.859 --> 06:34.695
YOUR VICTIM BURNED THROUGH
CORPORATE CASH

06:34.728 --> 06:36.163
LIKE IT WAS MONOPOLY MONEY,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.767
THEN MOVED COMPANY PENSION FUNDS
INTO OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.769
WHICH WE STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.171
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM --
WE -- WE THOUGHT THAT
NAME WAS FAMILIAR.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.073
CHIEF, I WAS --
NO!

06:46.106 --> 06:48.542
I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU
NOW, LIEUTENANT.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.210
IN ADDITION TO, UM,
CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.946
ISN'T THERE SOME GIANT
CIVIL SUIT AGAINST HIM?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.482
YEAH, FORMER EMPLOYEES
AND INVESTORS

06:54.515 --> 06:55.949
ARE TRYING TO RECOVER
WHATEVER'S OUT THERE.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.217
LOOK -- THE WHOLE THING
WAS A MESS.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.686
PROBABLY
JUST GOT A LOT WORSE.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.221
DETECTIVE,
WILL YOU PLEASE SEE

07:01.254 --> 07:04.692
IF ANY OF THE PLAINTIFFS
SUING MR. HIRSCHBAUM

07:04.725 --> 07:06.827
HAD EVER THREATENED HIM OR HAD
A HISTORY OF VIOLENT OFFENSES?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.963
ME? CHIEF, THERE'S GOT
TO BE LIKE 700-PLUS
PEOPLE IN THIS LAWSUIT.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.865
THEN I'D GET STARTED.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.869
Brenda:
IT ALSO SAYS HERE

07:15.903 --> 07:18.105
THAT MR. HIRSCHBAUM
HAD A WIFE AND DAUGHTER?

07:18.138 --> 07:19.907
MM-HMM.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.009
UH, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE NOTIFIED, LIEUTENANT.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.143
YES, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.779
NOW...

07:25.813 --> 07:29.182
HOW IS IT THAT YOU TWO
JUST HAPPENED TO BE

07:29.216 --> 07:32.886
DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE VICTIM
WHEN HE PLUMMETED TO HIS DEATH?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.688
WELL, FIRST, UH, CHIEF,

07:34.722 --> 07:36.256
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
GET YOUR SIGNATURE RIGHT HERE.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.559
THAT'S AN AUTHORIZATION
FOR OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.528
UH, YES, YES.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.563
YOU SEE, LAST NIGHT
I GOT A PHONE CALL

07:42.596 --> 07:44.231
FROM A LAWYER --
OWEN DOYLE.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.567
HE'S ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS
SUING YOUR VICTIM.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.836
Flynn: DOYLE JUST HAD
A CELL NUMBER ON HIRSCHBAUM,

07:48.869 --> 07:51.605
AND HE NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO FIND HIM TO SERVE
HIM THIS SUBPOENA.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.508
AND HOW DID YOU FIND HIM
WITH ONLY HIS CELLPHONE NUMBER?

07:54.542 --> 07:57.878
UH, WE...TRIANGULATED
HIS LOCATION.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.649
BY USING, UH, THE CATFISH.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.984
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE THAT.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.587
BUZZ DOES.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.660
WITH CAPTAIN RAYDOR
CONDUCTING A TRANSPARENCY AUDIT

08:12.693 --> 08:14.127
OF THIS ENTIRE DIVISION,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.029
YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA

08:16.063 --> 08:18.666
TO USE ONE OF OUR
CIVILIAN TECHS

08:18.699 --> 08:20.601
TO TRACK A PRIVATE CITIZEN
WITHOUT A WARRANT?!

08:20.634 --> 08:22.736
WELL,
I WOULDN'T SAY "BRILLIANT."

08:25.706 --> 08:28.576
YOU POSED WITH HIM?

08:28.609 --> 08:31.111
WELL, WE HAD TO HAVE
PROOF OF SERVICE.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.914
OH, THE VIDEO
IS A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.250
YOU MADE A VIDEO?!

08:37.284 --> 08:39.853
WELL, BUZZ
WAS ALREADY THERE.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.255
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.992
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.762
DETECTIVE,
PLEASE FIND THIS LAWYER DOYLE

08:48.796 --> 08:50.097
AND HAVE HIM BROUGHT IN
IMMEDIATELY.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.934
ONE OTHER THING --
AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

08:53.967 --> 08:57.170
ONLY THE FBI KNEW THAT
HIRSCHBAUM WAS AT THE HOTEL.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.673
EITHER THE KILLER
ALSO TRIANGULATED

08:59.707 --> 09:02.810
HIS UNLISTED CELLPHONE --
HIGHLY UNLIKELY -- OR --

09:02.843 --> 09:06.113
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE
LED THE KILLER TO THE HOTEL?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.247
THAT'S INSANE.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.216
Dr. Morales: CHIEF?
UH --

09:09.249 --> 09:11.251
YOU'LL WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.888
AS I SUSPECTED, DEATH WAS CAUSED
BY A .45-CALIBER BULLET,

09:14.922 --> 09:18.659
WHICH PIERCED HIS PERICARDIUM,
INSTANTLY STOPPING HIS HEART.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.360
BUT THE REAL SURPRISE --

09:20.393 --> 09:24.297
WELL, THE FACT THAT HIS NAME
WAS GIVEN TO ME AS "HIRSCHBAUM"

09:24.331 --> 09:27.000
PROVED TO BE
SOMETHING OF A...TIP-OFF.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.738
OR NOT.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.806
YEP, HE DOESN'T LOOK
THAT JEWISH TO ME.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.809
SO, I DID A LIVE SCAN
OF HIS FINGERPRINTS,

09:35.843 --> 09:39.847
AND HIS ACTUAL IDENTITY CAME
BACK AS SCOTT ESPOSITO, AGE 51,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.115
CONVICTED
OF SEVERAL PETTY CRIMES.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.017
TAKE A LOOK.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.353
WAIT, SO -- SO,
THIS IS NOT HIRSCHBAUM?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.689
IT'S AN IMPOSTER.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.357
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.225
YEAH.
WE SERVED THE WRONG GUY.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.661
AND WE DON'T GET PAID.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.104
THIS SURVEILLANCE
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR --

10:04.137 --> 10:05.739
CHIEF, THE LAWYER WHO HIRED
FLYNN AND PROVENZA IS IN 1.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.875
Brenda:
UH, THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.910
GO ON.
WE KNOW
IT WAS HIRSCHBAUM

10:09.943 --> 10:11.679
WHO CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL
ON TUESDAY,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.747
AND PHOTOS CONFIRM
HE WAS ON THE BALCONY

10:13.781 --> 10:15.348
AT 6:00 P.M. LAST NIGHT.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.686
NOW, WE BELIEVE HE SWITCHED WITH
YOUR VICTIM SHORTLY AFTER THAT.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.220
AND YOUR MEN
DIDN'T SUSPECT A THING?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.189
LOOK, DETECTIVE --
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
THAT ANY TWO GRAY-HAIRED,
MIDDLE-AGED MEN

10:24.157 --> 10:25.726
IN BLUE VELOUR TRACK SUITS

10:25.759 --> 10:27.928
WOULD BE DIFFICULT
TO DISTINGUISH AT 1,000 YARDS.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.130
TELL US WHAT ELSE YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE VICTIM.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.232
OKAY.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.768
SCOTT ESPOSITO
WAS A SOMETIME ACTOR

10:34.802 --> 10:38.772
WHO SUPPLEMENTED HIS INCOME BY
ENGAGING IN LOW-LEVEL CON JOBS.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.907
MAY I?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.274
OHH HO.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.378
WHEN YOU SERVED HIM,
DID HE SAY ANYTHING REVEALING?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.915
WELL, UH, HE MAY HAVE SAID,
"IT'S NOT ME.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.417
I'M NOT THE GUY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."

10:50.450 --> 10:53.420
HE ALSO SAID,
"YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.689
WAIT. DON'T GO.
I'M SCARED."

10:55.723 --> 10:57.958
HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANT?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.094
OKAY, OKAY.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.864
LET ME JUST
SEE IF I'VE GOT THIS RIGHT.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.132
IF THE KILLER'S TARGET

11:05.165 --> 11:07.334
WAS MR. HIRSCHBAUM
AND NOT THE DECOY,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.703
THEN THERE ARE
HUNDREDS OF SUSPECTS.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.873
BUT IF THE DECOY WAS THE TARGET,
THEN OUR PRIMARY SUSPECT

11:12.906 --> 11:15.242
WOULD SEEM TO BE
MR. HIRSCHBAUM HIMSELF.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.444
Gabriel: NOW, SEE,
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.047
HIRSCHBAUM'S A GUY WITH A TON OF
CASH LOOKING AT LIFE IN PRISON,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.349
SO HE KILLS HIS DOUBLE,
AND THEN HE JUST GOES OFF

11:22.382 --> 11:25.018
TO LIVE IN SOME TROPICAL
PARADISE, JUST LIKE KEN LAY.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.455
HMM, THAT'S FUNNY.
OH, COME ON.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.123
AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE

11:30.157 --> 11:32.359
THAT THINKS THAT KEN LAY
IS ON A BEACH IN FIJI RIGHT NOW?

11:32.392 --> 11:34.194
I MEAN,
THE GUY'S SUPPOSED BODY

11:34.227 --> 11:37.030
WAS CREMATED LIKE A MINUTE
AFTER THEY FOUND IT -- COME ON.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.166
YOU NEED TO GET A LIFE.
OH, I GOT IT,
AND THEN I COULD GET

11:39.199 --> 11:41.001
ANOTHER LIFE
AND KILL THAT GUY --

11:41.034 --> 11:42.936
CONSPIRACY
THEORIES ASIDE,

11:42.970 --> 11:44.471
CHIEF, WHAT DO WE SAY
TO THE PRESS?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.206
THAT STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM
IS DEAD.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.008
IF HE THINKS THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.476
HE'LL BE EASIER TO FIND.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.179
AND IF THE KILLER
IS NOT MR. HIRSCHBAUM,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.948
THEN WE DON'T WANT THAT PERSON
BACK ON THE HUNT.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.116
CHIEF -- LAWYER IN 1.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.517
I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

11:57.550 --> 12:00.053
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM
IS A FEDERAL FUGITIVE.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.222
FINDING HIM
IS THE FBI'S JOB.
BUT HE'S OUR SUSPECT.

12:02.255 --> 12:06.093
AND ONCE THE FBI HAS HIM
IN CUSTODY, YOU CAN DEBRIEF HIM.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.394
OKAY.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.896
UH, LIEUTENANT TAO,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.398
WHILE DETECTIVE GABRIEL
IS FOLLOWING UP

12:11.431 --> 12:13.433
WITH THE AGGRIEVED
EMPLOYEES,

12:13.466 --> 12:16.103
PLEASE FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD
WANT MR. ESPOSITO DEAD.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.771
CHIEF, WHAT ABOUT
ME AND PROV--

12:17.805 --> 12:19.139
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU
LATER!

12:24.311 --> 12:26.079
MR. DOYLE,
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,

12:26.113 --> 12:29.216
AND THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT
FRITZ HOWARD OF THE FBI.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.184
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW, HUH?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.320
I MEAN, I'M FINALLY STARTING
TO GET SOMEWHERE, AND NOW THIS?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.489
WELL, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE

12:36.523 --> 12:39.192
THAT MR. HIRSCHBAUM'S MURDER
HAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED YOU.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.994
CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT

12:41.028 --> 12:42.796
BETWEEN
8:00 AND 9:00 P.M.?

12:43.931 --> 12:47.267
THE SAME PLACE
I AM EVERY NIGHT -- AT MY DESK,

12:47.300 --> 12:49.002
TRYING TO FEND OFF
THE ENDLESS MOTIONS

12:49.036 --> 12:50.904
THAT CRETIN'S LAWYERS
ARE FILING AGAINST ME.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.239
WHO DO YOU THINK

12:52.272 --> 12:54.307
MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO KILL
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM?

12:54.341 --> 12:55.508
YOU HAVE A PHONEBOOK?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.410
HOW DID YOU
COME TO POSSESS

12:57.444 --> 12:59.880
MR. HIRSCHBAUM'S
PRIVATE CELL NUMBER?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.915
OH, HIS DAUGHTER'S A PLAINTIFF
IN THE CIVIL ACTION.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.183
SHE GAVE IT TO ME.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.318
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.387
MAYBE BECAUSE
SHE'S A DECENT PERSON

13:07.420 --> 13:09.156
WHO WANTED
HIS EMPLOYEES AND INVESTORS

13:09.189 --> 13:10.858
TO FEED AND CLOTHE
THEIR FAMILIES.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.359
I THOUGHT
I COULD REASON WITH HIM,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.361
BUT THE SCUZZBALL
WOULDN'T EVEN CALL ME BACK!

13:14.394 --> 13:16.096
CHIEF.
YES?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.366
I'M SORRY, BUT HIRSCHBAUM'S
FAMILY'S IN CHIEF POPE'S OFFICE.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.334
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.336
MR. DOYLE, EXCUSE ME.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.872
EXCUSE ME.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.541
BRENDA, BRENDA...

13:28.575 --> 13:30.978
I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTRADICT YOU
IN FRONT OF YOUR TEAM,

13:31.011 --> 13:33.346
BUT I REALLY CAN'T
GO ALONG WITH THIS DECISION

13:33.380 --> 13:35.883
TO WITHHOLD THE TRUE IDENTITY
OF THE VICTIM.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.318
YOU'D PREFER WE ALERT THE KILLER
TO HIS MISTAKE?

13:38.351 --> 13:40.988
NO, I'D PREFER
WE NOT DECEIVE THE PUBLIC.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.923
THE AGENCY HAS A POLICY

13:42.956 --> 13:44.591
AGAINST KNOWINGLY MAKING
FALSE STATEMENTS.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.593
THE AGENCY CAN JUST SAY
"NO COMMENT."

13:46.626 --> 13:48.962
YEAH, AND WHO
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT

13:48.996 --> 13:50.097
WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUT?

13:50.130 --> 13:50.964
Taylor: CHIEF?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.499
AGENT HOWARD,

13:52.532 --> 13:55.368
I'M OFF TO BRIEF THE PRESS
ON THE HIRSCHBAUM MURDER.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.503
ANYTHING
I SHOULD KNOW?

13:56.536 --> 13:57.971
JUST BE YOURSELF,
COMMANDER.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.439
RIGHT.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.443
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.184
WIFE AND DAUGHTER?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.419
YES.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.054
TO MANY PEOPLE,
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM

14:14.087 --> 14:15.956
MAY HAVE JUST BEEN
A CONVICTED FELON,

14:15.989 --> 14:20.593
BUT ALSO A FATHER AND HUSBAND
TO A RIDICULOUSLY HOT WIDOW.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.895
WOW.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.196
HOW'S THAT DIET
COMING ALONG?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.932
OH, OKAY -- COUPLE POUNDS.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.533
I THINK "WIDOW"
IS A LITTLE PREMATURE.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.301
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.104
YEAH, LIKE WHERE DID HE STOW
$300 MILLION?

14:31.138 --> 14:33.406
AND THAT THE LAST PEOPLE
TO HAVE SEEN HIM ALIVE

14:33.440 --> 14:35.242
MAY HAVE BEEN
FLYNN AND PROVENZA.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.044
WHAT?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.412
WE HAVE IT ALL ON VIDEOTAPE,
FILMED BY BUZZ.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.914
WHY?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.615
THEY WERE MOONLIGHTING
FOR SOME LAWYER,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.018
SERVING A SUBPOENA TO HIRSCHBAUM
IN A CIVIL SUIT.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.386
OH, MY GOD.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.088
AND THE PERSON
WHO FELL OFF THE BALCONY --

14:48.121 --> 14:49.456
NOT STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.691
NOT STEVEN HIR-- SO WHO
DO WE HAVE IN THE MORGUE?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.560
SOME ACTOR, WHICH WE AREN'T
GOING TO TELL THE PRESS

14:53.593 --> 14:55.162
WHILE WE'RE STILL
LOOKING FOR THE KILLER.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.997
YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

14:57.030 --> 14:59.933
TO HAVE SOMEONE
FROM THE L.A.P.D. LIE PUBLICLY?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.438
OH.
YEAH, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.475
GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.577
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.180
I AM SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.614
YOU MUST BE...

15:14.647 --> 15:16.283
SHANNON HIRSCHBAUM,

15:16.316 --> 15:20.120
STEVEN'S FOURTH AND
FINAL WIFE.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.722
AND I'M ANDREA,
HIS ONLY DAUGHTER...

15:22.755 --> 15:23.991
THAT WE KNOW OF.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.226
I SEE.
SO, YOUR MOTHER IS...

15:26.259 --> 15:28.128
MY DAD'S FIRST WIFE.
SHE LIVES IN BOCA RATON.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.429
WHICH IS WHY
I WISH YOU'D CALL ME "MOM."

15:29.462 --> 15:31.098
I'M NOT
CALLING YOU "MOM."

15:31.131 --> 15:32.966
SHANNON, YOU SAT BEHIND ME
IN 8th-GRADE FRENCH.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.301
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SUCH A TOTAL BITCH

15:34.334 --> 15:36.303
WHEN I'M ONLY
TRYING TO COMFORT YOU.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.672
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
STEVE'S DEAD.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.275
WELL, DEATH ISN'T ALWAYS
THE END, SHANNON.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.610
I KNOW
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

15:43.643 --> 15:45.578
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
AT A TIME LIKE THIS,

15:45.612 --> 15:48.348
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME THE LAST
TIME YOU SPOKE TO YOUR HUSBAND?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.383
UH, TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.220
YOU SEE,
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT,

15:53.253 --> 15:56.523
AND HE PACKED SOME THINGS
AND LEFT.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.059
DID HE SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?
NO.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.327
YOU SEE,
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.995
AND HE PACKED SOME THINGS
AND LEFT.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.131
SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GOING TO A HOTEL?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.398
NO.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.667
YOU SEE,
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT,

16:07.700 --> 16:10.670
AND HE PACKED SOME THINGS
AND LEFT.
PACKED SOME THINGS
AND LEFT.

16:12.072 --> 16:16.443
ANDREA, I UNDERSTAND YOU GAVE
YOUR FATHER'S CELLPHONE NUMBER

16:16.476 --> 16:17.610
TO THE ATTORNEY
SUING HIM.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.279
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.714
THE ATTORNEY TOLD ME.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.116
OKAY.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.152
WELL, I KNOW
THAT MIGHT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE

16:25.185 --> 16:27.720
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED,

16:27.754 --> 16:31.124
BUT I WAS -- I WAS JUST
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TALKING.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.162
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.197
UM, DO YOU THINK
ONE OF YOU

16:37.230 --> 16:40.600
COULD GET ME A COPY
OF MY DAD'S DEATH CERTIFICATE?

16:40.633 --> 16:44.071
YOU WANT A COPY OF HIS
DEATH CERTIFICATE RIGHT NOW?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.805
FOR THE LAWYERS, YEAH --

16:45.838 --> 16:47.774
SO THEY CAN START
TO PUT THINGS IN ORDER.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.511
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE
YOUR FATHER'S PRIVATE CELL

16:51.544 --> 16:53.213
TO THE LAWYER SUING HIM.

16:53.246 --> 16:57.016
YOUR FATHER NEVER EVEN
GAVE ME HIS PRIVATE CELL.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.653
Tao: GREAT MINDS
THINK ALIKE, CHIEF.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.390
IF OUR VICTIM, SCOTT ESPOSITO,
HAD HIRSCHBAUM'S CELL,

17:03.423 --> 17:05.158
WHERE'S
SCOTT ESPOSITO'S PHONE?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.494
SO, I FOUND ESPOSITO'S
CELLPHONE NUMBER,

17:07.527 --> 17:10.163
AND, SURE ENOUGH,
THAT PHONE IS STILL ACTIVE

17:10.197 --> 17:11.831
AND BEING USED
THIS MORNING.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.666
AND WHERE'S THAT PHONE
RIGHT NOW?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.835
CURRENTLY MOVING
THROUGH MID-WILSHIRE.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.072
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, IT DIALED
A PRIVATE LIMO SERVICE.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.475
LIEUTENANTS FLYNN AND PROVENZA,
HERE, NOW.

17:22.509 --> 17:26.079
CHIEF, NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE A LITTLE UPSET, BUT --

17:26.113 --> 17:28.448
THERE ARE NO "BUTS,"
LIEUTENANT.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.351
I'M SUSPENDING YOU BOTH
FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.819
O

17:32.852 --> 17:35.288
ON THE GROUNDS THAT YOU
PROCURED OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT

17:35.322 --> 17:37.090
WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION,

17:37.124 --> 17:41.561
USED L.A.P.D. EQUIPMENT
TO CONDUCT A WARRANTLESS SEARCH,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.730
ENLISTED A CIVILIAN
IN YOUR ILLICIT ACTIVITIES.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.165
NEED I GO ON?

17:45.198 --> 17:46.699
NO. THAT'S
A PRETTY COMPLETE LIST.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.401
AND SINCE MAJOR CRIMES
HAS AGREED

17:48.435 --> 17:52.805
TO LEAVE THE PURSUIT
OF MR. HIRSCHBAUM TO THE FBI,

17:52.839 --> 17:56.743
I WOULD BE APPALLED IF YOU,
AS PRIVATE CITIZENS,

17:56.776 --> 17:59.212
TRIED TO SERVE HIM AGAIN
BY TRACKING A NUMBER

17:59.246 --> 18:01.481
THAT MIGHT POINT
TO HIS CURRENT WHEREABOUTS.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.486
TELL BUZZ HE AND HIS CATFISH
DEVICE ARE SUSPENDED, AS WELL.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.156
MOVE ALONG.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.860
SUSPENDED?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.529
BUZZ, WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BUZZ?

18:16.563 --> 18:19.366
TO SPEND THE NEXT THREE DAYS
OF UNPAID LEAVE

18:19.399 --> 18:21.501
WITH ANYONE
BUT THE TWO OF YOU.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.602
EXCUSE ME.
UH, UH...

18:22.635 --> 18:24.237
UH, ALL RIGHT, FINE.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.606
BUT FIRST WE NEED YOU
TO TRACK A CELLPHONE FOR US.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.308
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:28.341 --> 18:31.278
THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO ALL
THIS TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.645
UNH-UNH. NO WAY. NOPE.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.714
LISTEN -- W-WE GOT INTO
THAT LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE

18:34.747 --> 18:37.450
LAST TIME BECAUSE HIRSCHBAUM
HAD TRADED PHONES WITH ESPOSITO.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.186
NOW, HOW COULD WE
HAVE KNOWN THAT?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.588
OH, I DON'T KNOW --
BY BEING DETECTIVES, MAYBE?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.724
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW
FOR SURE --

18:44.757 --> 18:47.294
ESPOSITO'S PHONE
JUST CALLED FOR A LIMO.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.762
THAT MEANS HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE AIRPORT.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.431
AND THE FBI
IS LOOKING FOR HIM, TOO.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.366
SO IF WE DON'T SERVE
THOSE PAPERS, LIKE, NOW,

18:53.400 --> 18:54.934
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET
ANY OF THE MONEY.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.803
AND YOU'LL NEVER
GET YOUR CAR FIXED.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.771
AS IF $200 WOULD HAVE
TAKEN CARE OF THAT, ANYWAY.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.872
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.408
I SPOKE WITH THE LAWYER,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.643
AND HE'S GONNA COVER
ALL YOUR EXPENSES,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.945
PLUS MAKE UP FOR YOUR
THREE DAYS OF LOST PAY.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.680
AND AN EXTRA $200.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.784
AND AN EXTRA $200 --

19:11.818 --> 19:17.624
IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE US A RIDE TO
WHEREVER YOUR CATFISH TAKES US.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.660
ALL RIGHT. LOOK, BUZZ.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.895
HAVE WE MADE MISTAKES
IN THE PAST 24 HOURS? YES.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.865
DID WE UNDERESTIMATE
THE POTENTIAL FOR FALLOUT?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.434
ABSOLUTELY.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.302
DID WE TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR KIND NATURE?

19:29.336 --> 19:30.770
PROBABLY.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.739
WOULD YOU BE WISER
NOT TO TRUST US?
FLYNN!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.808
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOUNG MAN --

19:35.842 --> 19:39.646
THIS TIME, THIS PHONE NUMBER
COMES FROM THE CHIEF.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.947
THE CHIEF!

19:43.583 --> 19:44.917
Buzz: ALL RIGHT.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.853
ESPOSITO'S PHONE
IS GONNA BE IN THAT BUNGALOW.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.588
AND DON'T
BUMP INTO THE LIMO.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.790
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT ME SUSPENDED.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.226
AND I WANT MY CAR FIXED
BY SOMEONE REPUTABLE.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.661
FINE. WHATEVER.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.364
NOW, FLYNN, LOOK --
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,

19:57.397 --> 19:59.399
IF BUZZ'S DEDUCTIBLE
IS A GRAND,

19:59.432 --> 20:01.368
WE'RE STILL
ALMOST $3,000 IN THE BLACK.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.869
WHAT?!

20:06.906 --> 20:10.277
AND I WANT 1/3 OF $4,000,
BEFORE REPAIRS AND EXPENSES.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.311
FINE. FINE.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.312
HEY!

20:12.345 --> 20:14.714
GET LOST.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.453
YEAH. YEAH. I'M OFF DUTY,
AND I FLASHED MY BADGE.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.389
I FLASHED IT. SUE ME.

20:22.422 --> 20:26.426
I WOULD, BUT I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER BODY LANDING ON MY CAR.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.799
HELLO?
YOU CALLED FOR A LIMO?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.668
Hirschbaum:
YEAH, JUST A MINUTE!
WHERE'S THE SUBPOENA?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.003
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.705
OH, GOD.
IT'S STILL IN EVIDENCE.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.575
UH...

20:44.511 --> 20:45.978
AAH!

20:46.012 --> 20:46.979
AAH!

20:47.013 --> 20:49.782
AAH! HELP! PLEASE!

20:49.816 --> 20:52.785
ASSASSINS! AAH!

20:52.819 --> 20:54.354
HELP!
COME HERE!

20:54.387 --> 20:56.489
HELP!
SON OF A --

20:56.523 --> 20:57.757
AAH!

20:59.792 --> 21:01.428
WILL YOU CALM DOWN?!

21:01.461 --> 21:04.063
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.399
WE TRACED
ESPOSITO'S CELLPHONE.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.400
CELLPHONE?

21:07.434 --> 21:08.935
THIS CELLPHONE?!
HEY!

21:10.102 --> 21:11.804
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.906
OH, MY GOD.
WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.776
IT'S RUINED.
THIS IS A $500 JACKET.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.312
YEAH, WELL, UH, TAKE A LOOK
AT WHO JUST SHOWED UP.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.448
OVER HERE -- LET'S GO.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.949
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.517
I SAY WE TURN HIM OVER
TO THE FEDS

21:24.551 --> 21:25.852
AND BE DONE
WITH THIS DOUCHE BAG.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.020
HEY, HEY.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.357
IF WE GIVE HIM TO THE FEDS,
WE'RE OUT THE FOUR GRAND,

21:30.390 --> 21:31.691
WE STILL HAVE TO FIX
BUZZ'S CAR,

21:31.724 --> 21:33.426
AND NOW WE GOT TO BUY YOU
A NEW JACKET.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.328
WELL, HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET HIM PAST THE AGENTS,

21:35.362 --> 21:37.497
WHERE WE CAN EVEN SERVE HIM
THE PAPERS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.499
WE ARE SCREWED!
SOMEONE CALLED FOR A LIMO?

21:43.570 --> 21:46.806
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
VERY FAR IN THIS, ARE WE?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.040
GET IN.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.784
LOOK -- I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD
HAVE TAKEN HIM TO YOUR PLACE,

21:57.817 --> 21:59.652
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BE OUT
AN EXTRA 100 BUCKS,

21:59.686 --> 22:01.954
WE COULD HAVE TAKEN
HIM TO SOME PLACE A
LITTLE LESS DISGUSTING.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.025
OH, LOOK -- YOU CAN STILL SEE
THE CHALK OUTLINE

22:06.058 --> 22:07.927
FROM THE LAST PERSON
WHO STAYED HERE.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.797
IS ANYBODY BESIDES ME
GETTING HUNGRY?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.932
NO.
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.034
OH, IT'S
AN UN-CATERED KIDNAPPING.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.603
BOY, YOU GUYS REALLY

22:16.636 --> 22:18.938
DID NOT THINK THIS THROUGH
AT ALL, DID YOU?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.740
YOU KNOW,
I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND

22:20.773 --> 22:22.509
WHY SOME PEOPLE
WOULD WANT YOU DEAD,

22:22.542 --> 22:24.711
EVEN IF YOU HADN'T STOLEN
THE PENSION FUNDS.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.979
OH, PLEASE.
AM I A LOUSY BUSINESSMAN?

22:27.013 --> 22:29.982
ABSOLUTELY. THE WORST.
BUT I AM NOT A CRIMINAL.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.152
I AM SIMPLY THE VICTIM
OF SOME FINANCIAL OVERSIGHTS

22:33.185 --> 22:36.489
THAT WERE SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING
TO EXPLAIN IN COURT.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.724
BUZZ.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.026
SO, THIS DUMP
DOES HAVE A FAX MACHINE.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.962
THERE'S THE NUMBER,
AND IT'S $2 A PAGE.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.498
THAT'S COMING OUT
OF YOUR 1/3.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.079
WHAT?

23:00.112 --> 23:03.583
AH, SANCHEZ --
CHARMING AS ALWAYS.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.117
UH, LISTEN --
WE HAVE HIRSCHBAUM,

23:05.151 --> 23:06.686
AND I NEED YOU
TO GET THE --

23:06.719 --> 23:08.588
OH, MAN. THE FEDS THINK
HE WAS KIDNAPPED.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.056
YOU GUYS
ARE LIKE REAL CRIMINALS.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.658
YEAH, WELL, LISTEN --

23:11.691 --> 23:13.493
I NEED YOU TO PULL THE SUBPOENA
FROM EVIDENCE

23:13.526 --> 23:14.494
AND FAX IT OVER TO ME.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.895
THE NUMBER IS --
Can't do it.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.030
THE FBI'S GOT ALL THAT STUFF
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

23:18.064 --> 23:22.469
WELL -- WELL, THEN GET ME
THE CHIEF ON THE PHONE.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.571
HIRSCHBAUM'S
GIRLFRIEND SAID

23:24.604 --> 23:27.206
THE KIDNAPPERS WERE
"THUGGISH OLDER MEN"

23:27.239 --> 23:29.542
AND THAT ONE OF THEIR
GRANDSONS WAS THERE,

23:29.576 --> 23:32.779
VIDEOTAPING IT ALL, PROBABLY
TO ESTABLISH PROOF OF LIFE.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.181
ANYWAY, SHE'S SITTING DOWN
WITH THE ARTIST.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.817
WE SHOULD HAVE FACES
TO DISTRIBUTE SHORTLY.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.554
CHIEF, UH, TAYLOR FOR YOU ON 3.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.956
OH.
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.758
YES, COMMANDER?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.994
IT'S PROVENZA.
WE HAVE HIRSCHBAUM.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.598
WE'RE FIVE MINUTES FROM
KILLING HIM AND THEN OURSELVES.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.100
BUT FIRST I NEED
A COPY OF THAT SUBPOENA

23:54.133 --> 23:55.868
so I can serve it to him.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.070
OH, THAT'S A SHAME,
COMMANDER.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.006
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE?

24:02.875 --> 24:03.910
CLOSED

24:03.943 --> 24:06.245
CLOSED. THANKS.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.581
I CAN'T GET YOU THAT SUBPOENA,
LIEUTENANT,

24:08.615 --> 24:10.517
and if you contact Doyle
and ask for new papers,

24:10.550 --> 24:13.152
THAT'S TELLING HIM
HIRSCHBAUM'S STILL ALIVE.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.823
AND MY WHOLE STRATEGY DEPENDS
ON PEOPLE THINKING HE'S DEAD.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.457
HANG ON.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.566
I CAN'T LEAVE
WITH AGENT HOWARD HERE,

24:26.599 --> 24:29.802
BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
FOR HIRSCHBAUM.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.137
MY BOSS HAS
SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.872
ARE YOU GONNA AT LEAST
READ ME MY RIGHTS?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.774
TELL HIM I DON'T HAVE TO
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.809
I'M ON THE PHONE.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.978
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO
READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS.
SHE'S ON THE PHONE.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.180
HIRSCHBAUM: I am sitting here
with two police officers.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.849
TELL HIM --
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.283
LIEUTENANT,
PUT ME ON SPEAKERPHONE.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.518
YEP.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.756
HERE -- SPEAKERPHONE.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.924
LIEUTENANTS FLYNN AND PROVENZA
ARE NOT POLICE OFFICERS TODAY.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.760
They're private citizens.

24:53.793 --> 24:56.062
WELL, THEN
I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.664
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO TELL THE FBI?

24:57.697 --> 24:58.798
They're right here.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.266
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.935
I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS,
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU --

25:02.969 --> 25:05.738
I AM FINDING THIS WHOLE
SITUATION EXTREMELY UPSETTING.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.740
WHY DID YOU KILL
SCOTT ESPOSITO?

25:07.774 --> 25:10.743
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT!

25:10.777 --> 25:12.278
I THINK YOU DID.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.647
I THINK YOU SET HIM UP
AT THE HOTEL AND THEN SHOT HIM

25:14.681 --> 25:17.650
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT BY THE TIME
WE REALIZED IT WASN'T YOU,

25:17.684 --> 25:19.218
YOU'D BE
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.720
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.955
HIS ENDING UP DEAD
SCREWED ME ROYALLY.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.291
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM,
WHO DID?

25:25.324 --> 25:27.159
WELL, THIS MAY COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU,

25:27.193 --> 25:28.895
BUT RIGHT NOW
I AM ABOUT AS POPULAR

25:28.928 --> 25:30.763
AS YOUR AVERAGE
MIDDLE-EASTERN DICTATOR.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.199
But if I had to guess, I would
say it was probably my wife,

25:33.232 --> 25:35.735
SHANNON,
THE NEAR-SIGHTED BITCH.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.870
WHY WOULD SHE WANT YOU DEAD?

25:37.904 --> 25:40.640
PROBABLY 'CAUSE SHE FOUND OUT
ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.676
And Shannon is the only person
that knew I was at that hotel.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.013
LIEUTENANT,
TAKE ME OFF SPEAKERPHONE.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.081
AH. HI.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.586
DID BUZZ VIDEOTAPE
THE ABDUCTION OF MR. HIRSCHBAUM?

25:53.620 --> 25:54.821
Uh-huh.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.723
YOU WANT HIM TO E-MAIL IT
OVER TO YOU?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.090
IMMEDIATELY.

25:58.124 --> 26:01.027
I'M ABOUT TO BRING
MR. HIRSCHBAUM BACK TO LIFE.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.865
WHAT KIND OF GOOD NEWS?
DID YOU FIND MY DAD'S KILLER?

26:05.898 --> 26:09.301
OH, IT'S SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THAT, ANDREA.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.303
YOU SEE, IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE MAN WHO DIED

26:11.337 --> 26:13.640
LAST NIGHT AT THE HOTEL
WASN'T EVEN YOUR FATHER.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.774
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHO WAS HE?

26:14.807 --> 26:15.942
AN IMPOSTER,

26:15.975 --> 26:17.977
HIRED TO THROW OFF
THE AUTHORITIES.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.379
MY HUSBAND'S ALIVE?
ARE YOU SURE?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.081
I AM.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.051
IN FACT, I'VE GOT SOME VIDEO
TAKEN OF HIM TWO HOURS AGO.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.318
UH, BEAR WITH ME.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.088
I AM AWFUL
WITH THIS CONTROL THINGY.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.191
THERE.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.062
HELLO?
YOU CALLED FOR A LIMO?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.897
Hirschbaum:
YEAH, JUST A MINUTE!

26:37.930 --> 26:39.398
THAT'S REALLY HIS
VOICE. THAT'S STEVEN'S VOICE.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.067
Flynn: OH, GOD,
IT'S STILL IN EVIDENCE.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.969
UH...

26:44.203 --> 26:45.972
WHAT IS HE DOING
WITH HER?

26:46.005 --> 26:47.840
AA--

26:47.874 --> 26:49.976
YOU KNOW THAT WOMAN?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.311
IT'S LISA FLEMING.
SHE'S OUR PERSONAL TRAINER.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.046
WHAT WERE THEY
DOING TOGETHER?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.748
HEADING OFF TO VENEZUELA,
I THINK.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.183
WAIT

26:57.216 --> 26:59.318
HE CAN'T BE TAKING LISA FLEMING
TO "CAWACKAS."

26:59.351 --> 27:01.721
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING ME,
THAT BASTARD.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.156
IT'S "CARACAS."
YOU PRONOUNCE THE "R."

27:04.190 --> 27:06.325
YOU KNOW, I THINK I LIKED
MY FATHER MORE WHEN HE WAS DEAD.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.927
LISTEN TO YOU.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.729
THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANTED THE DEATH CERTIFICATE

27:09.762 --> 27:11.764
WAS SO YOU COULD GO AND CLAIM
YOUR INHERITANCE, WHICH --

27:11.798 --> 27:13.232
LET'S BE HONEST -- YOU
WOULD PROBABLY WASTE
ON CHARITY, ANYWAY.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.834
YES, LET'S BE HONEST.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.703
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE HOTEL.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.170
WHAT ELSE
DID YOU LIE ABOUT?

27:18.204 --> 27:20.306
I TOLD YOU I LIKED
YOUR UGLY NEW HAIRCUT.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.974
YOU CAN START THERE.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.810
WHERE IS HE?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.344
YEAH
I WANT TO KNOW.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.748
I THINK THE MOTEL
IS CALLED LAS PULGAS.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.149
UH, LET ME CHECK.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.796
YEP?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.932
LIEUTENANT, IN BETWEEN
LEAVING HERE LAST NIGHT

27:45.965 --> 27:48.067
AND ARRIVING AT THE HOTEL,
WHERE DID YOU STOP?

27:48.100 --> 27:51.838
UH, WELL, UH, THE LAWYER'S
OFFICE, TO PICK UP THE PAPERS --

27:51.871 --> 27:53.039
IT'S THE CHIEF --

27:53.072 --> 27:54.974
AND THEN...
THE GAS STATION.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.243
WHY?
AND WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE
THE BROKEN TAILLIGHT?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.378
WHEN WE LEFT THE HOTEL.
That's what I thought.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.381
LET'S REPLAY THE EVENTS OF LAST
NIGHT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.751
UH, WHAT ABOUT
THE WIFE AND DAUGHTER?

28:07.153 --> 28:09.455
I'M RELEASING THEM BACK
INTO THE WILD, LIEUTENANT.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.157
STAY IN TOUCH.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.259
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY GRADUATED --

28:13.292 --> 28:15.161
ALL RIGHT, FLYNN,
HERE'S THE DEAL --

28:15.194 --> 28:16.996
YOU KEEP AN EYE
ON NUMB NUTS HERE,

28:17.029 --> 28:19.465
AND BUZZ IS GONNA RUN ME OVER
TO THE LAWYER'S OFFICE.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.268
LOOK -- IF THIS IS STILL ABOUT
COLLECTING THE FOUR GRAND,

28:22.301 --> 28:24.937
I SAY WE CUT OUR LOSSES
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.806
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO CUT OUR LOSSES, FLYNN.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.008
WE'RE IN A HOLE THAT'S
GETTING DEEPER BY THE MINUTE,

28:29.041 --> 28:30.409
AND NOW
IT'S FILLING WITH WATER.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.445
WE NEED THAT MONEY
JUST TO BREAK EVEN. COME ON.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.047
UH, EXCUSE ME.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.116
UH, GUYS, I COULDN'T HELP
BUT, UH, OVERHEAR.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.986
YOU KNOW, IF EITHER OF YOU
ARE EXPERIENCING

28:40.019 --> 28:42.088
ANY FINANCIAL
DIFFICULTIES --

28:42.121 --> 28:43.322
STAY OUT OF THIS.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.456
ALL RIGHT,
GO SEE THE LAWYER.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.892
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
HEAR ME OUT.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.359
PERSONALLY,
I THINK IT IS SHAMEFUL

28:47.393 --> 28:50.329
THAT HEROES
OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR,

28:50.362 --> 28:52.131
SUCH AS YOU GENTLEMEN,

28:52.164 --> 28:55.101
SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE OUTSIDE JOBS
JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.536
UH...

28:57.569 --> 28:59.305
WHERE YOU GOING WITH THIS,
HIRSCHBAUM?

28:59.338 --> 29:03.375
LOOK -- I WOULD NEVER DREAM
OF OFFERING YOU A -- A PAYOFF.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.177
BUT, UM, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

29:05.211 --> 29:08.380
ABOUT TAKING
AN UNTRACEABLE CASH...

29:08.414 --> 29:09.882
GRATUITY...

29:09.916 --> 29:13.452
TO, UH, YOU KNOW,
LOOK THE OTHER WAY?

29:13.485 --> 29:16.488
ARE YOU TRYING TO BRIBE
POLICE OFFICERS?

29:16.522 --> 29:18.891
W-WE'RE NOT POLICE OFFICERS
TODAY, BUZZ.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.327
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT CAMERA STAYS OFF.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.397
NOW, HOW MUCH ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT, EXACTLY?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.366
WELL...

29:27.399 --> 29:28.835
...I DON'T KNOW.

29:28.868 --> 29:29.869
$100,000?

29:30.970 --> 29:31.871
EACH.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.505
WELL --

29:33.539 --> 29:35.908
I COULD TRANSFER THE MONEY
TO AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR CHOOSING,

29:35.942 --> 29:37.309
YOU COULD
SERVE ME THOSE PAPERS,

29:37.343 --> 29:40.312
AND YOU WOULD NEVER
HEAR FROM ME AGAIN.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.315
ALL I NEED
IS A DISPOSABLE CELLPHONE

29:43.349 --> 29:45.784
AND AN INTERNATIONAL
CALLING CARD.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.958
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING THIS, ARE YOU?

29:51.991 --> 29:53.359
ARE YOU?

29:53.392 --> 29:54.861
OH, MY GOSH.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.229
YOU ARE!

30:03.035 --> 30:05.271
GENTLEMEN.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.039
FRITZIE!

30:07.073 --> 30:08.941
HOW'S THE HIRSCHBAUM
INVESTIGATION GOING?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.376
NOT SO WELL.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.412
IN FACT, IT'S TURNED INTO
MORE OF AN A.A.R.P. MANHUNT.

30:13.445 --> 30:17.850
ANY CHANCE YOU CAN IDENTIFY
THESE DISGRUNTLED SHAREHOLDERS?

30:19.318 --> 30:22.321
WELL, THEY DO LOOK
FAMILIAR.

30:22.354 --> 30:26.158
BRENDA, WE AGREED THAT MY PEOPLE
WERE GONNA FIND HIRSCHBAUM.
LOOK -- I SUSPENDED
FLYNN AND PROVENZA HOURS AGO.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.427
I HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER WHAT THEY'VE DONE SINCE.
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU HAD NO IDEA

30:28.460 --> 30:30.429
THEY CAPTURED
A FEDERAL FUGITIVE?
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW
IT'S HIRSCHBAUM?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.399
THE LAST HIRSCHBAUM WE FOUND
WASN'T EVEN HIRSCHBAUM.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.434
LOOK -- WHY DON'T YOU
RIDE ALONG WITH ME,

30:35.467 --> 30:37.136
AND IF THINGS
GO AS I EXPECT,

30:37.169 --> 30:40.639
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR FUGITIVE,
AND I'LL HAVE MY KILLER.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.078
WELL

30:55.321 --> 30:58.457
HEY! DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
WITH YOUR FOOT.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.429
OW.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.935
MR. DOYLE?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.336
AH. EVENING, LIEUTENANT.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.205
UH, I SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME
TO COLLECT YOUR MONEY.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.641
UH, ACTUALLY, NO.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.244
I, UM -- I HATE
TO BOTHER YOU WITH THIS,

31:18.277 --> 31:21.413
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED
ANOTHER COPY OF THE SUBPOENA.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.084
WHY WOULD YOU NEED
ANOTHER COPY OF THE SUBPOENA?

31:25.117 --> 31:27.586
UH, AS IT TURNS OUT,
THE GUY WE SERVED LAST NIGHT --

31:27.619 --> 31:29.989
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
THAT WENT OFF THE BALCONY --

31:30.022 --> 31:32.058
WAS NOT
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.461
THEN WHO WAS HE?

31:35.494 --> 31:37.196
SCOTT SOMEBODY,

31:37.229 --> 31:41.000
A LOW-LEVEL CROOK WHO WAS ALSO
A NOT-VERY-GOOD ACTOR.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.270
UH, ANYWAY, I'M -- I'M
GONNA NEED SOME FRESH PAPERS.

31:44.303 --> 31:49.075
I JUST SPENT THE LAST 12 HOURS
DRAFTING NEW MOTIONS

31:49.108 --> 31:51.643
BASED ON THE ERRONEOUS IDEA
THAT THIS GUY IS DEAD.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.447
Y-Y-YOU PEOPLE ARE --
ARE TERRIBLE.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.249
YEAH, BUT --

31:57.283 --> 31:58.450
I MEAN, REALLY.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.286
N-N-NOW, LOOK -- UM,
MY PARTNER AND I

32:00.319 --> 32:03.555
HAVE HIRSCHBAUM AT THIS FLEABAG
JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.625
JUST GIVE ME THE SUBPOENA,
WE SERVE HIM, YOU PAY US,

32:06.658 --> 32:09.261
AND EVERYTHING'S
RIGHT BACK ON TRACK, RIGHT?

32:09.295 --> 32:10.562
YEAH, YEAH.
GREAT. FINE.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.064
I JUST -- I --

32:12.098 --> 32:13.932
I NEED A COUPLE OF MINUTES
TO RUN THIS OFF.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.370
HONESTLY.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.545
MM.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.714
THIS IS WHERE MY TAILLIGHT
WAS BROKEN OUT LAST NIGHT

32:28.747 --> 32:30.382
WHILE MY CAR
WAS JUST PARKED HERE.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.084
WHY?

32:32.118 --> 32:34.220
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO SOMETHING
SO SENSELESS AND CRUEL?

32:34.253 --> 32:37.089
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR CAR
EASIER TO FOLLOW IN THE DARK.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.690
GET IN.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.096
I'M NEVER GONNA LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH TAKING THAT BRIBE.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.432
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

32:46.465 --> 32:50.369
YEAH, WELL
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

32:50.402 --> 32:52.738
WHAT FLYNN AND I COULD DO
WITH THAT MONEY.

32:55.041 --> 32:58.410
AND LET ME TELL YOU -- THE BEST
THING FOR YOU, YOUNG MAN,

32:58.444 --> 33:01.513
IS TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
ABOUT ALL OF THIS, HUH?

33:01.547 --> 33:04.216
NOW, PULL AWAY FROM HERE
AND DRIVE SLOW.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.384
WHY?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.453
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES,
FOR ONCE,

33:07.486 --> 33:10.422
WOULD YOU JUST DO IT,
MR. GOODY

33:11.690 --> 33:14.260
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM IN YOU.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.725
LOOK -- THE AUTHORITIES CALL IT
"SEXUAL TOURISM,"

33:46.758 --> 33:50.229
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S
ALL YOU DO WHILE YOU'RE THERE.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.298
THESE WOMEN
ARE AMAZING TOUR GUIDES.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.133
THE BEACHES
ARE FANTASTIC --

33:55.367 --> 33:57.203
Provenza: FLYNN?

33:58.104 --> 34:00.106
READY?
YEAH. READY, FREDDY.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.740
ALL RIGHT, LOOK --
WE'RE GONNA SERVE YOU THE PAPER,

34:01.773 --> 34:04.210
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR PICTURE,
AND THEN WE'RE GONE.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.777
GOOD.
AND LISTEN. LISTEN.

34:05.811 --> 34:09.315
I'M GONNA ACT REALLY SURPRISED
WHEN I OPEN THE DOOR, OKAY?

34:10.416 --> 34:11.717
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
A NICE TOUCH.

34:11.750 --> 34:12.751
YEAH.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.558
ALL RIGHT.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.327
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, GO.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.464
Hirschbaum:
WHO IS IT?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.399
THE MAID!
JUST A SECOND!

34:29.235 --> 34:30.869
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.471
YOU'RE NOT THE MAID!

34:32.504 --> 34:35.807
UH, STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM,
CONSIDER YOURSELF SERVED!

34:40.246 --> 34:43.449
OKAY. THAT'S THAT.
WE'RE SQUARE, HUH?

34:43.482 --> 34:45.684
JUST DO US A FAVOR --
COUNT TO 60 BEFORE YOU COME OUT.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.119
60 -- GOT IT.

34:47.153 --> 34:50.156
HEY, YOU GUYS,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

34:50.189 --> 34:51.390
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
THE THREE OF YOU --

34:51.423 --> 34:54.260
YOU WITH
THE GRUFF ATTITUDE

34:54.293 --> 34:58.130
AND YOU WITH THE MUCH BIGGER
HEART THAN YOU LET ON, MISTER,

34:58.164 --> 35:02.201
AND YOU,
ALL WIDE-EYED AND INNOCENT.

35:02.234 --> 35:05.271
I THINK I'M GONNA MISS YOU
MOST OF ALL.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.740
YEAH, YEAH.
SO LONG, DOROTHY.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.349
WAIT -- I LEFT THE CATFISH
IN THERE.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.351
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE DAMN CATFISH.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.886
WE'LL GET IT LATER.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.422
I'LL PICK IT UP WHEN I COME BACK
TO GET MY SECURITY DEPOSIT.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.157
LET'S GO.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.926
AAH! MOTHER-OF-PEARL.

35:27.959 --> 35:32.798
JUST DRIVE AROUND TO THE SIDE
OF THE BUILDING AND STOP.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.779
...11 MISSISSIPPI...

35:47.813 --> 35:49.515
12 MISSISSIPPI...

35:54.586 --> 35:56.955
...19 MISSISSIPPI...

35:56.988 --> 35:58.724
20 MISSISSIPPI...

36:06.432 --> 36:08.534
...36 MISSISSIPPI...

36:08.567 --> 36:10.769
37 MISSISSIPPI...

36:10.802 --> 36:12.238
DROP YOUR WEAPON!
DROP IT!

36:12.271 --> 36:13.372
WHAT THE --
WHAT? OKAY.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.373
DON'T MOVE!
OKAY.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.974
DON'T MOVE.
OKAY.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.476
Hirschbaum:
...MISSISSIPPI...
I HAVE A PERMIT FOR THAT.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.211
DID IT PERMIT YOU TO KILL
SCOTT ESPOSITO?

36:19.245 --> 36:20.612
OWEN DOYLE,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR MURDER.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.248
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.782
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ANYTHING YOU S--

36:23.815 --> 36:25.851
I MAY NOT BE
THE BEST ATTORNEY IN THE WORLD,

36:25.884 --> 36:27.286
BUT I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.455
OH, THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I HIRE YOU.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.958
WELL, AS LONG AS
WE GET THE FOUR GRAND
YOU OWE US, WHO CARES?

36:34.526 --> 36:36.595
GOOD JOB.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.464
...58 MISSISSIPPI...

36:38.497 --> 36:41.333
59 MISSISSIPPI...

36:41.367 --> 36:42.834
AND 60.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.539
FBI.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.375
AAH!

36:50.609 --> 36:52.278
AAH! AAH!

36:54.413 --> 36:55.447
NO! NO! NO!

36:55.481 --> 36:57.516
AAH! HELP!

36:57.549 --> 37:00.886
NO! UGH!

37:09.828 --> 37:14.366
HEY. HEY. ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.967
I BRIBED
OFFICERS FLYNN AND PROVENZA,

37:16.001 --> 37:17.636
AND WHEN THAT COMES OUT
IN COURT,

37:17.669 --> 37:19.405
YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK
RIDICULOUS!

37:19.438 --> 37:21.773
Flynn: WELL, NOT AS RIDICULOUS
AS YOU'RE GONNA LOOK,

37:21.807 --> 37:23.909
HAVING PUNCHED
YOUR OFFSHORE ACCOUNT NUMBERS

37:23.942 --> 37:26.345
INTO THIS
DISPOSABLE CELLPHONE.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.879
YES. THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU LOOK TOO GOOD.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.917
I...REALLY CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.890
OHH, MY CATFISH --
IT'S BROKEN.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.593
YOU TWO
ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

37:41.627 --> 37:43.762
FOR REPLACING
THAT EQUIPMENT.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.666
AND...

37:47.699 --> 37:48.667
GOOD WORK.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.935
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.770
YEAH.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.984
HEY, HEY, ARE YOU THE GUY
THAT TRIED TO KILL ME?

38:06.017 --> 38:07.719
WHAT DID I EVER DO
TO YOU, HUH?

38:07.753 --> 38:09.921
TRY RETURNING A PHONE CALL
EVERY NOW AND THEN!

38:09.955 --> 38:12.458
Gabriel: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?! GET OVER HERE!

38:12.491 --> 38:14.393
CONSIDER THE DAMAGE
TO MY REPUTATION.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.328
HEY, YOU TOOK ONE
FOR THE TEAM, OKAY?

38:16.362 --> 38:18.430
LOOK, LOOK -- HOW --

38:18.464 --> 38:19.765
HOW DOES THIS
MAKE ME LOOK?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.800
COMMANDER, IF YOU CAN'T
PUT A POSITIVE SPIN

38:21.833 --> 38:23.435
ON OUR ARRESTING
A MURDERER,

38:23.469 --> 38:25.804
I GOT TO WONDER IF IT MIGHT BE
TIME FOR YOU TO MOVE ON.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.740
UNH-UNH. NO, NO. NO.

38:28.774 --> 38:31.009
I CAN LIVE WITH THIS.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.512
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHY WOULDN'T I THINK IT?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.947
YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU WERE GETTING PAID,

38:35.981 --> 38:38.617
YOU WRECKED MY CAR,
YOU GOT ME SUSPENDED,

38:38.650 --> 38:40.051
AND YOU MADE ME
SPEND A DAY AND NIGHT

38:40.085 --> 38:41.520
WITH THE WORST PERSON
ON EARTH!

38:41.553 --> 38:43.655
BUT WE DIDN'T TAKE A BRIBE.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.057
YEAH, AND AFTER WE FIX YOUR CAR
AND PAY FOR THE MOTEL

38:46.091 --> 38:50.462
AND, UH, REPLACE FLYNN'S SUIT
AND REPAIR THE CATFISH,

38:50.496 --> 38:51.963
WE'LL HAVE $600.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.033
THAT'S 200 BUCKS
APIECE, HUH?

38:56.435 --> 38:57.869
Doyle:
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.605
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

38:59.638 --> 39:01.840
THAT MY SHOWING UP
AT THAT MOTEL HAD NOTHING TO DO

39:01.873 --> 39:03.975
WITH MY PLANNING TO KILL
STEVEN HIRSCHBAUM,

39:04.009 --> 39:06.044
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO SHOT THAT OTHER GUY.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.747
BALLISTICS MATCHED YOUR GUN
TO THE BULLETS

39:08.780 --> 39:09.815
TAKEN FROM
THE VICTIM.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.718
I LENT THAT GUN
TO A FRIEND.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.753
YEAH, BUT WE ALSO FOUND THE
VICTIM'S BLOOD ON YOUR CAR SEAT,

39:14.786 --> 39:17.789
DOOR HANDLE, AND ON
A HANDKERCHIEF IN YOUR OFFICE.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.626
I SUPPOSE ALL THIS
MAKES ME THE CRIMINAL HERE?

39:20.659 --> 39:22.994
WELL, SIR,
YOU DID KILL SOMEBODY.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.062
AN ACTOR!

39:24.095 --> 39:25.897
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I WILL ADMIT

39:25.931 --> 39:28.734
THAT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT
KILLING THE RIGHT PERSON.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.736
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE
FAILING MURDER 101.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.505
BUT I NEVER INTENDED TO KILL
THAT OTHER GUY.

39:33.539 --> 39:34.906
INTENT TRAVELS
WITH THE BULLET, SIR.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.875
IF YOU MEANT TO KILL
MR. HIRSCHBAUM,

39:36.908 --> 39:39.144
THE FACT THAT YOU ONLY KILLED
SCOTT ESPOSITO

39:39.177 --> 39:41.179
IS IMMATERIAL
IN THE EYES OF THE LAW.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.614
REALLY?

39:42.648 --> 39:45.717
UH, DID YOU ACTUALLY
GO TO LAW SCHOOL?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.553
YES, I WENT
TO LAW SCHOOL --

39:47.586 --> 39:49.955
THE VERY BEST
THE CARIBBEAN HAD TO OFFER,

39:49.988 --> 39:51.757
WHICH IS WHY
I CAN ASSURE YOU

39:51.790 --> 39:54.560
THAT EVERY DAY
HIRSCHBAUM IS ALIVE

39:54.593 --> 39:57.629
IS ANOTHER DAY HIS VICTIMS
AREN'T GETTING THEIR MONEY.

39:57.663 --> 39:59.097
POKE HOLES IN THAT.
GO ON. GO ON.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.899
POKE HOLES.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.134
YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE EVERYTHING
I HAVE DONE UP UNTIL NOW

40:03.168 --> 40:05.003
HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY LEGAL --

40:05.036 --> 40:06.638
YOU KNOW,
EXCEPT FOR THE MURDER.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.073
AND BREAKING MY TAILLIGHT.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.175
I'M NOT JUST ARRESTING YOU
FOR MURDER.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.677
I'M ARRESTING YOU

40:11.710 --> 40:13.945
SO YOUR CLIENTS CAN GET
BETTER REPRESENTATION.

40:13.979 --> 40:18.884
OKAY, I KNOW THAT KILLING
AN EMBEZZLER OR EVEN AN ACTOR

40:18.917 --> 40:20.652
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
PLAN "A,"

40:20.686 --> 40:22.788
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE
ANY OF THIS

40:22.821 --> 40:25.791
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT
THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY,
TOTALLY DEAD BROKE.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.559
WHAT?!

40:27.593 --> 40:29.561
AND THE MONEY YOU WERE PAYING
TO HAVE MR. HIRSCHBAUM SERVED?

40:29.595 --> 40:31.129
I DON'T HAVE IT.
I NEVER DID.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.865
A-AND NOW I --
I NEVER WILL.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.743
HOW DOES A JOB THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO NET US FOUR GRAND

40:44.776 --> 40:46.111
WIND UP COSTING US
FOUR GRAND?

40:46.144 --> 40:47.946
WHAT YOU CALL THAT --
PROVENZA

40:47.979 --> 40:49.014
OH, AS USUAL --

40:49.047 --> 40:50.749
LIEUTENANTS,
CHIEF POPE AND I

40:50.782 --> 40:51.583
WERE JUST DISCUSSING
THE GOOD NEWS.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.918
YEAH

40:52.951 --> 40:55.020
TURNS OUT THERE'S A REWARD
FOR INFORMATION

40:55.053 --> 40:57.789
LEADING TO THE RECOVERY OF
THE HIRSCHBAUM PENSION FUNDS --

40:57.823 --> 40:58.857
$10,000.
WE'RE RICH.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.158
Fritz:
THE ONLY HITCH IS,

41:00.191 --> 41:02.160
IF YOU WERE WORKING
AS LAW ENFORCEMENT

41:02.193 --> 41:04.062
AT THE TIME OF UNCOVERING
THE MONEY, YOU CAN'T COLLECT.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.632
WELL, THAT'S PERFECT
BECAUSE WE WERE OFF-DUTY.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.866
AH.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.000
WELL, THEN
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO EXPLAIN

41:09.034 --> 41:10.636
TO PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS

41:10.669 --> 41:12.671
WHY YOU WERE USING
POLICE EQUIPMENT WHILE OFF-DUTY

41:12.704 --> 41:14.239
TO PERFORM
A WARRANTLESS SEARCH.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.907
SO, THAT MEANS...

41:15.941 --> 41:18.109
THAT MEANS YOU CAN EITHER
ACCEPT THE REWARD AND RESIGN,

41:18.143 --> 41:19.878
OR YOU CAN DECLINE IT
AND KEEP YOUR JOBS.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.112
WELL, NOW --

41:21.146 --> 41:23.682
HEY, I-I'M NOT
A POLICE OFFICER.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.617
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S NOT.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.719
BUT HOW WAS HE INSTRUMENTAL
IN UNCOVERING THE FUNDS?

41:27.753 --> 41:29.087
OH, UH, WELL --

41:29.120 --> 41:30.922
I BOUGHT THE CELLPHONE
THAT HIRSCHBAUM USED

41:30.956 --> 41:32.524
TO REVEAL
HIS ILLEGAL MILLIONS.

41:32.558 --> 41:33.625
THERE YOU GO.

41:33.659 --> 41:34.860
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.830
HEY, BUZZ, WAIT.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.632
WE'LL HELP YOU
FILL OUT THAT FORM.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.068
YEAH. YEAH, YOU DO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS MEANS, RIGHT?

41:43.101 --> 41:44.870
YES -- I'M RICH.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.905
NO, YOU'RE SPLITTING IT
THREE WAYS.

41:46.938 --> 41:47.906
FINE.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.140
WE CAN EACH HAVE 1/3.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.709
$200.
