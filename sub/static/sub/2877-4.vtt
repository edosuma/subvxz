WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:05.879
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.924
Honey, I got us that room
at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

00:09.134 --> 00:12.928
That place in Vermont?
You can take a hint.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.597
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.182
- Yeah.
- We're having a party.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.351
Can't you have the party
when we get back?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.563
- No.
- No. It won't be her real birthday.

00:22.731 --> 00:27.985
Gee, if only she were 1 and had
no idea what the hell a birthday was.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.821
Come on, you guys,
this is really important to us.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.991
Sorry, but Chandler and I
could really use a weekend away...

00:34.159 --> 00:38.245
...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.289
I read about it in Maxim.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.460
Well, can't you just go
to Vermont the next day?

00:44.669 --> 00:46.420
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

00:46.588 --> 00:51.800
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.595
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.889
I mean, how can we have
her first birthday party...

00:57.057 --> 00:58.891
...without her aunt and her uncle?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.186
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.856
Fine. But if we end up not doing
this Maxim thing because of this party...

01:06.024 --> 01:08.567
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.777
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...

01:51.945 --> 01:55.114
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.283
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.578
Aw, I love family traditions like that.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.957
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...

02:05.125 --> 02:09.252
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.423
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.635
- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
- Oh, good!

02:16.803 --> 02:19.304
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...

02:19.472 --> 02:22.224
...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
- Oh, cool.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.726
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.397
Oh, just think, she's gonna be
watching that video on a TV...

02:28.565 --> 02:31.233
...that hasn't even been invented yet...

02:32.026 --> 02:35.654
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.

02:35.822 --> 02:39.700
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...

02:39.868 --> 02:41.451
...to escape the ant people.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.914
That's the hope.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.335
- So is Emma awake yet?
- No, it's still naptime.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.212
- But she'll be up soon.
- Where's Joey?

02:52.422 --> 02:54.631
I said, it's still naptime.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.052
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.139
Hey, say something to Emma
on her 18th birthday.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.060
- Eighteen, huh?
- Joey, no!

03:07.228 --> 03:10.731
What? What? It's for her hot friends.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.025
When they see this, you'll be 52.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.486
And starting to think about
settling down.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.990
Hey, Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.117
Love to. Yeah.

03:23.995 --> 03:27.206
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.666
Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?

03:29.834 --> 03:33.212
- Joey, it's a birthday party.
- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.

03:33.379 --> 03:37.925
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for, like, an hour at a cup.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.929
Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,
dressed as a farmer.

03:42.096 --> 03:47.809
And he's standing next to this cow,
and the cow says, "El-moo."

03:51.189 --> 03:55.108
Man, that's a funny cup.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.112
Hey.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.074
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.787
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.250
I know you guys really want to get to
Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.379
But it really is to us, okay?
Emma will never have a first birthday again.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.755
You're right. We're sorry.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.216
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!

04:20.385 --> 04:23.011
No, she didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.514
Are you frigging kidding me, Green?

04:29.477 --> 04:32.062
- Hi!
- Hey!

04:32.230 --> 04:35.482
- I'm so glad you came.
- I can't believe Emma's already 1.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.901
I remember your first birthday.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.029
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.283
He pulled on his testicles so hard...

04:44.450 --> 04:47.369
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.458
There's something you didn't know
about your dad.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.546
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.924
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?

05:01.092 --> 05:04.636
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?

05:04.804 --> 05:09.182
If we gave this present to Emma
from all of us.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.644
Which one are you?

05:18.109 --> 05:22.112
- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
- I know. What are we gonna do?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.282
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.870
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.374
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.669
I'm not going to Vermont
with this Monica.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.756
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

05:40.923 --> 05:42.799
I was thinking since you wrote a song...

05:42.967 --> 05:45.886
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.680
So you're gonna hit on her?

05:50.350 --> 05:53.393
- No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
- Oh.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.687
You know, I could, like, maybe...

05:55.855 --> 05:59.107
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.611
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.365
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- Oh, Emma might like what?

06:06.532 --> 06:09.034
- Uh, my present.
- What did you get her?

06:09.202 --> 06:12.037
- Actually, we prepared performances.
- Separate performances.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.373
But equally real.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.541
That sounds like fun.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.251
You know what, actually?

06:18.419 --> 06:21.463
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.924
So would you mind
performing them once now?

06:24.092 --> 06:25.759
- Sure, yeah!
- Okay.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.513
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started, huh?

06:29.680 --> 06:32.599
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.434
Oh, great.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.354
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?

06:37.522 --> 06:40.982
I do it every week with three cameras
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.946
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

06:46.114 --> 06:50.367
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.829
Oh, okay. Which one?

06:53.996 --> 06:56.706
Uh, well, it's one of her favorites.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.546
"Riding the Storm Out:
Coping With Postpartum Depression."

07:06.509 --> 07:08.176
Love You Forever.

07:10.805 --> 07:16.643
"Love You Forever, by Robert Munsch.
Published by Firefly Books. Printed...

07:16.811 --> 07:18.228
...in Mexico.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.696
Ahem. A mother held her new baby
and very slowly rocked him...

07:27.864 --> 07:32.909
...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.

07:33.077 --> 07:38.498
And while she held him, she sang,
'I'll love you forever.

07:38.666 --> 07:42.752
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...

07:42.920 --> 07:45.881
...my baby you'll be."'

07:46.299 --> 07:48.300
"And while he rocked her, he sang:

07:48.468 --> 07:53.555
'I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.807
As long as I'm living...

07:55.975 --> 07:59.352
...my baby you'll be."'

08:00.771 --> 08:02.981
Oh, wow!

08:03.691 --> 08:05.066
That was amazing.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.195
Thank you so much for that gift.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.240
I was not ready for this today.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.453
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.289
- Phoebe has prepared something.
- That's right.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.376
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.

08:23.544 --> 08:28.215
For there's no greater gift
than the gift of music.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.511
Emma

08:33.679 --> 08:36.515
Your name poses a dilemma

08:36.682 --> 08:38.683
'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma

08:38.851 --> 08:40.727
Maybe the actor, Richard Crenna

08:40.895 --> 08:43.020
He played the commanding officer
in Rambo.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.982
Happy birthday, Emma

08:51.948 --> 08:54.074
Is that it?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.409
No, of course not.

08:56.577 --> 09:00.747
No, I've also, you know,
prepared a reading.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.918
Um, "Sex and the Single Mother."

09:06.879 --> 09:10.090
- "Finding your G-spot."
- Oh, no, no, no!

09:11.801 --> 09:14.427
Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.764
Right now, that seems so far away,
17 years.

09:17.932 --> 09:22.060
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be...

09:23.104 --> 09:25.522
Well, your grandfather and I
might not be here.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.108
That's true. This message
could be coming to you...

09:28.276 --> 09:30.026
...from beyond the grave, Emma.

09:31.028 --> 09:36.825
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.871
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.

09:42.039 --> 09:46.042
Okay, cut! Great. Great. That was just...

09:46.210 --> 09:48.420
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.089
Ross, uh, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.258
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.554
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.

09:57.722 --> 10:01.016
Oh, my God, that place has
the creamiest frosting.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.476
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.065
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...

10:09.233 --> 10:13.695
...in all different shapes. And if you give
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.

10:13.863 --> 10:18.158
- Did you do a picture of Emma?
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

10:18.326 --> 10:22.162
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...

10:22.330 --> 10:23.913
...erotic cakes?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.709
Say, for bachelorette parties?

10:27.877 --> 10:31.087
Ross, what are you talking...?
Oh, my God!

10:31.255 --> 10:33.632
They put my baby's face on a penis!

10:36.844 --> 10:39.596
Now it's a party!

10:40.431 --> 10:42.390
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny,
all right?

10:42.558 --> 10:45.894
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!

10:46.187 --> 10:50.273
Uh... Is it okay that I still think
it looks delicious?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.738
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.158
The resemblance is uncanny.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.331
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.419
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
okay?

11:11.587 --> 11:15.548
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...

11:15.716 --> 11:19.678
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!

11:19.845 --> 11:23.723
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

11:23.891 --> 11:26.559
...so we could put it on the bunny.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.312
That is a weird sentence.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.817
Oh, believe you me,
I am going to bring this cake back.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.277
I don't even want it in my home.
Don't touch it!

11:36.445 --> 11:38.488
I'm so confused!

11:39.657 --> 11:43.118
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!

11:43.285 --> 11:45.829
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.831
To be fair, this one does have nuts.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.339
Hey, Mon, it was nice of you
to loan Rachel your car...

11:56.507 --> 11:59.843
...so she could get the cake.
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...

12:00.010 --> 12:01.636
...till I dropped the key.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.765
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...

12:05.933 --> 12:09.477
...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?

12:09.645 --> 12:12.313
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.357
Are you still enjoying your nap?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.196
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.698
You may not recognize us...

12:21.866 --> 12:25.368
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.870
We used to be married.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.874
But then we missed a weekend away
together, and things kind of unraveled...

12:31.041 --> 12:33.543
...because of you.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.920
Happy birthday.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.882
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.551
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.889
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.641
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.478
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.

12:51.645 --> 12:55.231
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?

12:55.399 --> 12:57.734
All right, five more minutes.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.780
Hello?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.948
Oh, no, what happened?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.910
Okay, okay, where are you?

13:07.077 --> 13:09.204
Okay, I'll be right there.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.955
Was that Emma? Is she up?

13:12.291 --> 13:14.167
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.795
She forgot her license.
So I have to bring it to her.

13:16.962 --> 13:22.008
- If you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!

13:22.176 --> 13:24.344
We've been complaining the longest!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.931
No, wait, you guys. No, you can't leave.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.517
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.812
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?

13:33.979 --> 13:36.564
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.694
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.446
Got it!

13:45.032 --> 13:46.991
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.535
To the bathroom.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.745
Well, the rest of you
get comfortable, okay...

13:50.913 --> 13:53.164
...because we are gonna be here for a...

13:53.332 --> 13:58.503
- Wait, there's a window in there.
- Oh, no! He's not getting away that easy!

13:59.547 --> 14:02.924
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

14:09.223 --> 14:12.308
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.185
- No, it did not.
- No.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.397
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.399
Jack's not allowed
to drive at night anymore.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.109
He has trouble staying in his lane.

14:21.277 --> 14:25.238
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.782
The papers thought it was a hate crime.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.289
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.624
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Nighty-night.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.002
- Nighty-night.
- Bye.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.796
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.800
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.345
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
a Quaker to get out of Korea.

14:51.056 --> 14:55.977
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in. Ha.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.731
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.358
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.199
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.620
- Hey.
- So how'd your audition go today?

15:13.787 --> 15:17.123
- What audition?
- The one I told you about last week.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.375
What? You never said anything
about an audition.

15:23.130 --> 15:27.634
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.470
I think you can still make it.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.599
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
need to have a monologue prepared.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.560
A monologue? I don't have a...

15:40.731 --> 15:43.816
I got it. Uh...

15:43.984 --> 15:46.069
So I'm gonna take off.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.905
- What?
- What? Wait! You don't get to leave.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.200
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.328
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!

15:55.537 --> 15:57.038
Well, okay, now...

15:57.206 --> 15:59.624
...only one of us has to stay with Emma.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.127
Okay, and as the person
who realized that, I get to go.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.296
No, no, no. No. No.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.299
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.551
Oh, I got it.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.805
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to 10, all right?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.474
Whoever gets the highest number
gets to go first.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.104
- Okay, 10.
- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.605
Anyone else?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.484
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.945
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer...

16:29.113 --> 16:31.698
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Right.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.368
Okay, how about this? We got
wind-up toys for Emma for her birthday.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.913
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.332
Yeah, let's do that!

16:41.542 --> 16:44.419
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!

16:44.837 --> 16:48.464
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- Okay. I want the dolphin!

16:48.632 --> 16:51.759
- That's a bear.
- I'm too excited!

16:52.428 --> 16:55.304
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.515
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.103
And the race is going to go
from here to here.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.481
Now, the one who comes in last stays!

17:05.648 --> 17:07.817
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.

17:08.027 --> 17:12.238
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!

17:12.406 --> 17:13.865
Come on, robot!

17:15.992 --> 17:19.328
What are you barking at?

17:24.251 --> 17:26.586
Well, how is that gonna help?

17:27.003 --> 17:30.798
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?

17:31.133 --> 17:33.301
Way to go, robot!

17:33.635 --> 17:36.137
Good job, Alan.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.890
- Hey, good race, you guys.
- Yeah, see you later.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.100
No. No, no. Wait.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.685
We didn't lose.

17:43.103 --> 17:47.440
The rules clearly stated that the last one
to cross the finish line was the loser.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.735
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically...

17:50.903 --> 17:51.944
They left.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.412
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're just gonna come home.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.040
Everybody left?

18:05.209 --> 18:09.712
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.091
- Rachel!
- Oh, God, sorry!

18:13.258 --> 18:16.719
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.891
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.643
I can't believe this.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.355
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
we're not even there.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.775
Everybody left. We still have
this stupid obscene cake.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.487
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.323
Oh, don't even bother.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.951
We've already ruined
her first birthday.

18:40.119 --> 18:44.330
And do you know how important these
early experiences are, Ross? Very!

18:44.498 --> 18:47.500
According to the back cover
of that book that you gave me.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.087
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.340
I guess.

18:55.217 --> 19:00.847
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.182
Emma laughing...

19:03.350 --> 19:07.436
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."

19:07.604 --> 19:11.357
And then we would all... Hey, get out
of the road, you stupid student driver!

19:13.902 --> 19:15.153
They have to learn.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.532
- Hey.
- What?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.826
This is not bad.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.789
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?

19:26.957 --> 19:29.917
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.

19:32.045 --> 19:35.464
And then I split this to make ears.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.301
Well, I am very impressed.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.386
Some can sing, some can dance.

19:40.554 --> 19:44.015
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.

19:46.476 --> 19:50.813
Now, another way to organize
your stuffed animals is by size.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.066
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma
or for Monica?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.986
Game?

19:57.154 --> 20:01.532
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're 1.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.410
One year old. That's little.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.498
That's my girl.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.668
That's how old you are.

20:12.836 --> 20:16.297
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.760
Aw, I want one.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.721
Me too.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.063
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.607
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.275
I wasn't. Let's get going.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.030
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.909
- Good, I didn't miss the party.
- What about your massage client?

20:45.077 --> 20:50.039
I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
slipped him a little something, you know.

20:50.207 --> 20:53.376
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.921
Okay.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.342
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.887
I've been here the whole time.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.475
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.

21:10.519 --> 21:14.522
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.400
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.902
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?

21:20.070 --> 21:21.862
How old are you today?

21:24.908 --> 21:28.953
Oh, Emma, that's right. You're that many.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.789
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.959
- This means...
- No! No science camp!

21:35.127 --> 21:39.630
- Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
- Oh...

21:39.798 --> 21:45.594
Oh, and, Emma, look at your
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.680
Thanks.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.183
Okay, here we go.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.521
Emma's first birthday cake.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.607
Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.319
Come on, Emma. You can do it.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.655
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.366
These are happy tears. Ha, ha.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.785
This is just what I wanted.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.164
Hey, you made it into a bunny.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.836
What is wrong with me? It looked
more delicious when it was a penis.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.511
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay, you ready?

22:27.679 --> 22:31.265
- And record.
- Okay.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.144
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and...

22:37.606 --> 22:40.066
Go! Go! Come on!

22:40.233 --> 22:44.487
Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard!
