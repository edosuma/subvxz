WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:11.176
The woman you think
is your mother--

00:11.178 --> 00:12.678
She's your kidnapper.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.312
My daughter is alive.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.181
You have a $500,000 book
advance that has to be repaid.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.450
I asked him not to write
that book, and he's not.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.286
You ain't even heard
our family therapy session.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.022
I can't even say
your name without

00:23.024 --> 00:25.324
Taylor going "Blech"
and walking out the room.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.961
I get it, we're broken up,
but we're sitll friends.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.129
Yeah. Always.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.031
Max!
What're you doing here?

00:32.033 --> 00:35.401
I invited Max to stay
for a couple of days.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.669
What about school--
you go to school, don't you?

00:37.671 --> 00:39.605
Gabe's dad is the guy
who followed me

00:39.607 --> 00:40.906
that day I came
to visit you in Virginia.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.309
Nobody will be following Carter
after my little FBI sting.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.577
Molly?
You ever tried it?

00:45.579 --> 00:49.148
No.
We get it from
this guy, Crash.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.650
I liked you better when
I thought you were dead.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.785
She's having a seizure.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.220
I really
don't like him.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.992
(kids laughing)

01:02.996 --> 01:05.597
(Kyle)
<i>You knew the FBI was gonna</i>
<i>take the case, come on.</i>

01:05.599 --> 01:07.066
Lori Stevens
has not left the state.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.101
<i>So whatever happened</i>
<i>to that alias list</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:10.369
<i>that you were</i>
<i>putting together?</i>

01:10.371 --> 01:12.137
I passed it along
with the file.

01:12.139 --> 01:15.140
<i>Liz, you have</i>
<i>to let this go.</i>

01:15.142 --> 01:16.308
I know, I know.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.545
You don't have one piece
of solid information

01:19.547 --> 01:20.212
on Lori Stevens.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.014
And the only lead
you have is your gut.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.116
Well, I know this,
she thinks that Carter

01:24.118 --> 01:25.617
is her daughter,
and there's no way

01:25.619 --> 01:29.154
<i>that she's going to leave</i>
<i>her daughter behind.</i>

01:33.927 --> 01:37.396
As a mother, I know this,
and as a cop, I know this.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.098
She's going to go
to any length

01:39.100 --> 01:41.200
to make sure that
they're back together.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.569
Holy crap.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.636
Holy crap.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.506
Lori's alias is...

01:50.143 --> 01:51.610
Kyle...

01:51.612 --> 01:54.213
I have no idea what
this woman is capable of.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.514
<i>All right,</i>
<i>all right, look,</i>

01:55.516 --> 01:57.282
<i>we can talk about this</i>
<i>at work, okay?</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:59.785
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

(Carter)
I just wanna apologize

02:39.326 --> 02:40.392
for the gag me and my
friends pulled

02:40.394 --> 02:43.862
at the food court,
I'm really sorry.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.098
I am truly sorry.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.699
We good?

02:47.701 --> 02:48.800
Excuse me?

02:48.802 --> 02:50.235
I just wanna apologize.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.937
Officer "Be jerky?"

02:51.939 --> 02:54.106
It's Bjerki.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.041
Oh, come on,
I can't be the first person

02:56.043 --> 02:58.477
who's made that mistake.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.979
Hey, how's it going?

03:00.981 --> 03:04.349
I'm learning the actual names
of the people who hate me.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.986
And the correct way to
pronounce them, so that's good.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.289
Well, they prefer to slap
you and your friends

03:10.291 --> 03:12.391
with an obstruction
of justice charge.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.694
Consider yourself lucky.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.795
Do these hurt?

03:16.797 --> 03:20.299
Yeah.
Good.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.467
Who's that?

03:23.136 --> 03:26.672
That is a blond-haired,
blue-eyed piece of raw sewage.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.839
Carter?

03:27.841 --> 03:29.575
Just finish up
here, okay?

03:29.577 --> 03:32.144
There's a lot more
that we need to discuss.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.679
Oh, I do hope
it's another list

03:33.681 --> 03:35.547
of things I've done wrong.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.517
(chuckles)

03:38.519 --> 03:40.819
I'm sorry,
it wasn't my idea.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.821
I don't envy you.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.190
Having her for a mother.

03:45.192 --> 03:45.757
She's not my mom.

03:45.759 --> 03:49.928
She is the woman I have to live
with until I find my real mom.

03:49.930 --> 03:53.832
Which is hopefully
before you guys find her.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.833
Well, to be honest,

03:54.835 --> 03:58.337
that's turned out to be a lot
harder than we expected.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.037
Really?

03:59.039 --> 04:01.506
Besides you, all we've got
is a tip line

04:01.508 --> 04:03.442
with sightings
from 50 different countries.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.311
Who even knows what
she looks like now.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.980
Or what her name is.

04:07.982 --> 04:11.083
Really, you have
absolutely no idea?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.151
Neither does the FBI.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.688
That makes me
really happy.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.891
Also, really sad.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.497
But thank you.

04:25.499 --> 04:29.067
♪

04:44.250 --> 04:46.685
Hey, Carter, Carter.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.119
What?

04:47.121 --> 04:49.888
Don't you remember I said we had
some other things to discuss?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.456
Yes, but does it
have to be right now?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.491
My friends are
waiting for me.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.526
Look, I know
that you've had to make

04:54.528 --> 04:56.194
some huge adjustments
in your life,

04:56.196 --> 04:59.564
and your dad and I have
tried to give you a long leash.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.399
I'm on a leash?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.733
Well, you chewed
through it.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.901
I am loving
this dog analogy.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.571
The point is, clearly we need
to set some boundaries.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.674
Such as?
Such as a curfew.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.008
Okay, pass, next.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.843
No, you don't get
to pass.

05:11.845 --> 05:15.247
So, it's not enough
that you're a cop,

05:15.249 --> 05:19.618
now you wanna throw in
old-timey parent, as well?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.585
Fine.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.354
What, you want me
to check in with you

05:22.356 --> 05:23.288
if I'm out past midnight.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.557
I want you home
by 10:00 p.m.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.291
(scoffing)

05:26.293 --> 05:28.060
Okay, you have
a sense of humor.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.194
Didn't know that
about you.

05:29.196 --> 05:29.928
And one minute later,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.330
I discontinue
your phone service.

05:31.332 --> 05:31.963
You can't do that.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.199
Don't you need that
to monitor my every move?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.101
I don't enjoy
being this person,

05:36.103 --> 05:39.538
but you've been making some
really bad decisions lately,

05:39.540 --> 05:42.140
one that landed you
in the hospital.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.042
Fine.

05:44.044 --> 05:48.146
But look, I am capable
of learning from my mistakes.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.216
All I want
is to be a good parent.

05:51.218 --> 05:55.087
Okay, well, I had one of those
so I know what it looks like.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.423
This isn't it.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.262
Do you know
any of those cops, Gabe?

06:04.264 --> 06:05.430
They all seem like jerks.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.799
Oh, you met "Be jerky."
(laughing)

06:07.801 --> 06:10.502
I apologized to each
of them individually.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.771
But is Elizabeth happy?
Nope.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.974
Because Elizabeth is only happy
when she's got a gun

06:15.976 --> 06:18.243
pointed at your head,
telling you to kiss the wall.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.946
Crash, hey!

06:20.948 --> 06:22.647
Hey, hey, baby Bird.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.517
I'm sorry I missed your party
the other night, but I, uh,

06:25.519 --> 06:26.485
I heard it was
pretty eventful.

06:26.487 --> 06:31.556
Yeah, it was fun,
you missed out.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.792
Hey, I'm Crash.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.760
Hey.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.162
You were at
the police station earlier.

06:37.164 --> 06:37.562
Yeah.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.564
I would've come over
and introduced myself

06:39.566 --> 06:43.635
but I wasn't exactly
mobile.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.504
Ofe, Gabe.
What's up?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.305
And I didn't
get your name?

06:47.307 --> 06:50.375
Oh, it's Carter.

06:50.377 --> 06:50.909
Here we go.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.411
Hey, Carter just
got out of the hospital.

06:52.413 --> 06:56.982
She had a blackout seizure from
some of your ratchet molly.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.117
Sorry to hear
you were in the hospital.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.419
It's fine,
it's not like I have

07:00.421 --> 07:03.655
a perfect attendance
record or anything.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.990
It couldn't
have been from me.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.858
Who told you it was
from me?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.093
Was that you, Ofe?

07:08.095 --> 07:12.397
Dude, I've got so many
little baggies in here.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.065
I'm gonna start
labeling them.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.067
I don't want you putting
my name on some baggy, man.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.770
Course not,
everybody else.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.073
And the blank ones
will be yours.

07:24.343 --> 07:28.847
All right, so...
what's on tap for tonight?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.749
(snickering)

07:30.751 --> 07:33.452
Are we going somewhere or are we
staying in, I'm good for both.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.354
I have to leave
because I...

07:36.356 --> 07:38.190
have a curfew now.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.257
It's not even 10:00.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.091
Yeah, well, thank God

07:40.093 --> 07:43.628
'cause I really
can't stay any later.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.063
Bye guys, have fun.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.031
Sorry I can't stay.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.833
Hey-hey,
yes, you can.

07:47.835 --> 07:48.834
For like five minutes.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.703
Okay, you know how Elizabeth was
with you in the police station?

07:51.705 --> 07:54.406
Well, she's also
like that at home.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.240
Then yeah, yeah,
you should go.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.309
I wouldn't want you to
have to go through that.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.810
I'm sure the last thing
you wanna do

07:58.812 --> 08:01.780
is make that woman angry.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.454
See, there you go,
nothing to worry about.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.324
Now just act
casual like...

08:12.326 --> 08:13.758
not like that.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.162
I'm very glad that you decided
not to challenge me on this.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.932
What she's trying
to say is, hello.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.569
Who's this?

08:24.571 --> 08:26.404
Uh, this is Bird.

08:26.406 --> 08:26.972
Nice to meet you.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.541
Hi, I'm David,
this is Elizabeth.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.110
That's Ofe.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.144
Thank you for having me.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.413
David, Elizabeth.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.817
Hi, Mrs. Wilson,
Mr. Wilson.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.952
Uh, it's-- yeah, the kitchen
is just through there.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.055
Gabe, you can show them.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.824
What, you said
I had to be home by 10:00.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.225
You didn't say I couldn't
have friends over.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.427
I think it's great,
I'm glad you have friends.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.829
I can't wait to get
to know them.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.698
<i>We</i> can't wait
to get to know them.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.132
Great.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.769
Well, uh, this one
you already know.

08:57.771 --> 09:01.273
Oh, I don't believe
we've met, David.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.475
Crash, thanks
for having me.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.327
Hmm, not a lot here.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.830
A slice
of cheddar cheese...

09:25.832 --> 09:29.868
Oh, yes, sold.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.803
Dude with the food.
Yes.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.537
Perfect timing, man.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.673
That was the first time
you've been happy to see me.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.641
Oh, now you're talking.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.476
Anyone want
Coco Spheres?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.679
American cheese spread?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.815
Ooh, salsa.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.418
Do you want anything?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.019
I'm good.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.462
How does she
get away with it?

09:57.464 --> 09:59.764
Get away with what?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.701
Well--
bringing people over.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.902
Having a party.

10:03.904 --> 10:08.106
Are we not allowed
to do that?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.742
Hm.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.010
You guys...

10:12.012 --> 10:15.046
you gotta
check this out.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.048
You think these might
be aliases?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.249
Dude, will you
keep it down?

10:18.251 --> 10:20.251
Aliases for Carter's mom?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.187
I don't know, I need
to do a thorough search.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.022
But I can't do it at home
with Sgt. Medeiros

10:24.024 --> 10:24.789
looking over my shoulder.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.958
Okay, we can do it
at my place tomorrow.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.762
You gonna say anything
to Carter?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.264
Not unless
we find anything.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.933
I don't wanna get
her hopes up.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.869
To the mall.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.303
What?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.372
No, is that not
our rallying cry?

10:40.374 --> 10:41.573
I really think it worked
last time.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.308
You know what,
never mind.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.410
It was a metaphor.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.045
Your place is so nice.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.714
I don't really
think of it as my place.

10:49.716 --> 10:53.018
I mean, the FBI does,
but I don't.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.651
FBI?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.187
What, you never heard of a girl
who came home safe and sound

10:56.189 --> 10:58.890
after being
abducted 13 years ago?

10:58.892 --> 10:59.991
That was you?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.626
Yeah, um-hmm.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.628
So, you're famous.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.898
Yup, well, the only thing
I really want

11:06.900 --> 11:11.903
is to be at home
with my real mom.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.939
It's funny
you should say that.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.642
That's all I want too.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.616
It seems harmless.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.851
They're playing music,
they're eating food.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.852
All of that
would be fine

11:27.854 --> 11:29.854
if one of 'em
wasn't a criminal

11:29.856 --> 11:30.889
I had just arrested.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.459
Then wouldn't the smartest move
be to avoid him completely?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.827
He's in my home.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.364
That jeopardizes my case
and my career-- David!

11:39.366 --> 11:41.132
I know that this
isn't your style,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.301
that you prefer to be
the cool dad.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.037
I can't have this conversation
if you're gonna mock me.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.838
I'm not mocking you.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.506
Using air quotes
is mocking.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.109
I'm sorry, I guess
I just didn't know.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.211
I never again will use
air quotes.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.979
No, you can
use air quotes,

11:54.981 --> 11:56.815
just not when you're
talking about me.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.615
Now go on,
you were saying--

11:57.617 --> 11:59.217
I don't even remember
what I was saying.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.485
You arrested
one of these kids.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.420
Which one was it?
I bet he had a toothpick--

12:02.422 --> 12:06.024
No, Crash, the good-looking,
taller one?

12:06.026 --> 12:07.992
The surfer dude,
the surfer dude?

12:07.994 --> 12:09.260
What's he done?
You name it,

12:09.262 --> 12:10.929
arson, assault, burglary,

12:10.931 --> 12:13.164
possession with a deadly
weapon, all before 18.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.700
He's been in juvenile
lock-up most of his life.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.103
Now he thinks that
he's a model citizen

12:18.105 --> 12:20.038
because he's just
dealing drugs.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.339
Where did Carter
meet him?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.173
At the police station today

12:22.175 --> 12:25.076
as I was handcuffing him
to the chair.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.180
David, she cannot get
sucked into this guy's life.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.483
She can't,
he is a drug dealer.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.384
I get it,
he has to leave.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.521
But I don't wanna
go out there as the cop.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.023
I wanna go out there
together...

12:39.025 --> 12:42.393
as Carter's parents.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.528
Well, let me
talk to him.

12:43.530 --> 12:47.465
Maybe he'll respond
to my cool dad shtick.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.669
Thank you.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.605
Come on.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.876
<i>♪</i>

12:57.878 --> 13:00.378
Uh-- It was
almost empty.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.580
That's fine, Gabe.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.889
This all looks fine.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.525
What the--

13:13.527 --> 13:16.461
Grant! Go to your room!

13:22.802 --> 13:24.369
I'd call the police,
but I don't have to

13:24.371 --> 13:25.970
because she's already here.
What's going on?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.474
This animal was teaching your
brother how to roll a joint.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.408
Hey, hey, it's all good.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.212
That wasn't weed,
we were using oregano.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.215
(whispering)
Oh, man, did I just
buy a bag of oregano.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.349
Did you really do that?

13:38.351 --> 13:40.285
I'm sorry,
the kid said he was 12.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.052
He is 12!

13:41.054 --> 13:41.986
Out there
in the real world,

13:41.988 --> 13:43.221
this is considered
a basic life skill.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.424
He's a sociopath, you didn't
tell me he was a sociopath.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.159
Just 'cause we come
from different backgrounds

13:48.161 --> 13:49.828
doesn't mean I'm a socio--

13:49.830 --> 13:52.964
Get out of our house.

13:54.099 --> 13:57.836
Yeah, he's right,
you gotta go.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.269
Okay.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.806
And you can never have anything
to do with him again, ever!

14:01.808 --> 14:05.376
Do you understand me?

14:05.378 --> 14:08.947
Yeah, yeah,
I understand you.

14:12.084 --> 14:15.787
Well, it was really
nice meeting you.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.179
Bye.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.890
Do you understand me?

15:03.502 --> 15:07.572
After last night,
this is nice.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.873
Yeah, it is.

15:08.875 --> 15:13.177
Can I ask you a potentially
awkward question?

15:13.179 --> 15:14.913
Are there any other kind?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.814
(chuckling)

15:16.816 --> 15:19.150
Who did you think
your father was?

15:19.152 --> 15:21.653
I mean, what had you
been told growing up?

15:21.655 --> 15:22.921
(chuckling)

15:22.923 --> 15:25.089
What-- am I not
gonna like this?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.659
No, it's just um...

15:27.661 --> 15:32.130
Well, I was always told
that my father was this

15:32.132 --> 15:36.267
beautiful stranger who my mom
had a wild fling with

15:36.269 --> 15:40.371
when she was backpacking
through Europe after college.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.942
Huh, I feel like
I must be a letdown.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.143
(chuckling)

15:45.145 --> 15:46.144
No.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.746
It's just kind of weird,
I guess.

15:48.748 --> 15:54.085
I mean, I never thought
I'd get to meet my father.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.121
And... here you are.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.159
The only bad thing
about you, of course,

16:01.161 --> 16:04.862
is that you come
with Elizabeth.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.499
You know, it's too bad
you didn't get to meet my mom.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.803
I really think you two
would've hit it off.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.006
Well, maybe
in a parallel universe.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.741
I just--

16:16.743 --> 16:18.810
I don't get
you and Elizabeth.

16:18.812 --> 16:23.881
I'm sorry, you just-- you seem
so wrong for each other.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.884
She's definitely not
the person I married.

16:26.886 --> 16:30.355
What happened to her?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.223
Oh, what,
so this is my fault?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.859
Oh, God, no, no,
not at all.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.029
Well... in some ways.

16:38.031 --> 16:38.997
How, exactly?

16:38.999 --> 16:42.200
You notice how slow
we are going home

16:42.202 --> 16:44.502
because I don't wanna go.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.536
It feels...

16:45.538 --> 16:49.807
less like a home
and more like a war zone.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.545
And you're negotiating
a peace treaty?

16:54.547 --> 16:59.250
At least a ceasefire?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.519
Well, has Elizabeth
signed on?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.722
She's trying.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.625
I know it doesn't seem
like she is, but...

17:07.627 --> 17:08.559
it's harder for her.

17:08.561 --> 17:12.630
Your heart's still beating,
hers stopped 13 years ago.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.565
And scene.
(chuckling)

17:14.567 --> 17:18.703
What did you do, write this
conversation out in advance?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.004
Your heart
is still beating,

17:20.006 --> 17:22.373
hers stopped 13 years ago,
seriously?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.510
What-- I thought
that was pretty good.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.744
Ha-ha.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.947
I don't think I realized till
just now how long it's been

17:29.949 --> 17:33.951
since I felt like
anybody was listening to me.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.423
It's great
having you home.

17:38.425 --> 17:42.326
Except when I'm blowing
the place up, right?

17:42.328 --> 17:45.496
Yeah, even then.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.834
All right, these
are the websites

17:49.836 --> 17:51.436
the police use
for background checks.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.005
If she's applied for a credit
card, driver's license,

17:54.007 --> 17:56.707
even a change of address,
it'll turn up on one of these.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.543
All the things that violate
a person's privacy.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.345
Isn't there a chance the cops
have already done this?

18:01.347 --> 18:02.613
I'm sure
they've already done it.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.082
Then why are we
even doing it?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.249
Aren't we just
wasting our time?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.618
'Cause we're all
so busy studying 24/7.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.220
'Cause we have
insights and information

18:09.222 --> 18:10.455
that the police
don't have.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.889
Maybe one
of these aliases

18:11.891 --> 18:13.691
was Carter's mom's
best friend

18:13.693 --> 18:14.358
from when she was five,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.994
and that could give us
a clue about Lori Stevens.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.831
We can do things that the police
could never do

18:19.833 --> 18:21.833
because we have
a source on our side.

18:21.835 --> 18:25.303
And ultimately, we wanna
help her find her mom.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.104
You're just
determined to be

18:26.106 --> 18:27.538
her knight in shining
armor, aren't you?

18:27.540 --> 18:30.074
She seemed to have a different
knight in mind yesterday.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.042
That thing with Crash?

18:31.044 --> 18:33.611
That was nothing,
it was Carter making a point.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.246
It didn't mean anything.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.514
I hate to pull the wool
off your eyes,

18:36.516 --> 18:40.318
but I'm pretty sure
Carter's into the bad boy.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.953
Who's a bad boy?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.521
Me.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.324
Hi.
Hey.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.593
♪

18:48.595 --> 18:51.262
(soda can hisses)

18:55.300 --> 18:58.269
Is this okay?

18:58.271 --> 18:58.636
What?

18:58.638 --> 19:02.273
If I just sit here
and... watch you?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.174
Yeah, sure.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.177
It's not that interesting,
I'm just making croutons.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.512
Croutons?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.113
Are you serious,
I love croutons.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.583
The first salad I ever made
was a big bowl of croutons.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.385
Had some blue-cheese
dressing on it.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.420
I still
make it sometimes.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.823
Do you wanna learn how?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.091
It's pretty easy.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.760
Yeah-- of course.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.864
I got one.

19:37.609 --> 19:41.512
So you just
put these in the bowl.

19:41.514 --> 19:46.050
Okay.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.585
Little bit of oil.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.656
Stop!

19:51.658 --> 19:52.657
Okay.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.459
Now mix 'em until
they're all coated.

19:57.763 --> 19:58.996
Is this right?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.699
There's not really
a wrong way to mix.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.733
(chuckling)

20:02.735 --> 20:04.402
Can't believe
I'm making croutons.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.838
Carter's lucky to have
such a cool sister.

20:08.006 --> 20:11.676
No, you've got it backwards,
Carter's the cool sister.

20:11.810 --> 20:16.314
Well, you're-- you're smart
and you're nice and...

20:16.316 --> 20:17.381
beautiful and...

20:17.383 --> 20:20.585
No, you're just
as cool as her.

20:23.822 --> 20:27.658
Uh... then spread
'em out on this.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.562
Good, really good.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.231
(Elizabeth)
Hey.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.165
Wow, this is nice.

20:34.167 --> 20:38.836
I'd forgotten how peaceful
it can be around here.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.840
Now just throw
spices all over.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.577
Max, how come Carter can't
go out with someone like you?

20:46.579 --> 20:49.180
We did go out.

20:49.182 --> 20:51.382
We just...

20:51.384 --> 20:53.184
work better as friends

20:53.186 --> 20:55.453
with occasional benefi--

20:58.290 --> 21:02.126
They were very occasional.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.128
All right.
Good.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.630
Does that look good?

21:05.632 --> 21:08.499
I think you have a future
in spicing croutons.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.101
(chuckling)

21:10.103 --> 21:12.036
That's not a real job.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.273
Is that a real job?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.008
Come back in 30,

21:17.010 --> 21:20.544
and you can help me
make a salad.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.545
Cool.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.547
All right.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.519
I really like Max.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.553
Me too.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.554
Wonder if there's a way

21:30.556 --> 21:33.591
I can get them back
together, Max and Carter.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.226
As I think you know,

21:35.228 --> 21:37.228
Carter pretty much
does what she wants

21:37.230 --> 21:38.262
and only what she wants.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.331
No question,
she's a willful teenager.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.066
I used to be one too,
believe it or not.

21:42.068 --> 21:47.138
But you, my little girl,
were never one, thank God.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.740
You know, it's funny,
when my mom would get

21:49.742 --> 21:53.277
really angry with me,
she'd yell this thing at me,

21:53.279 --> 21:56.113
like it was an ancient
gypsy curse.

21:56.115 --> 22:00.518
"I hope one day you have
a child just like you."

22:00.520 --> 22:02.219
Well, it worked, I do.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.921
I don't think
Carter's gonna care

22:03.923 --> 22:05.289
what you were like when you
were a teenager.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.626
And I don't think
she's gonna listen to you.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.633
That's what
I'm counting on.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.440
You guys, this is not fun.

22:26.611 --> 22:27.111
Seriously?

22:27.113 --> 22:29.046
(Gabe)
I didn't want
to get your hopes up,

22:29.048 --> 22:31.215
but I'm glad you came by.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.818
Do you recognize any
of your friends or family?

22:33.820 --> 22:38.122
We didn't have
any other family.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.090
I was told.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.658
Find anything, Ofe?

22:40.660 --> 22:41.058
Yes.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.661
My father's been donating
to Libertarian candidates

22:43.663 --> 22:44.995
for the past
three elections.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.731
That's it,
I'm taking over.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.432
Okay, what name
are we on?

22:48.434 --> 22:51.102
Catherine Reilly.

22:51.104 --> 22:54.138
Wait, Catherine Reilly,
oh, my God.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.206
That's a mailing address.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.874
That's a brand-new
mailing address.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.343
Fredericksburg, that's not
far, that's maybe an hour.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.345
We can go
first thing tomorrow.

23:01.347 --> 23:04.682
(whispering)
Man, you've got it
made in the shade.

23:08.653 --> 23:09.453
Welcome home.

23:09.455 --> 23:12.490
You set the whole
thing up, didn't you?

23:12.492 --> 23:14.158
The burner-phone texts,

23:14.160 --> 23:15.526
the coded message?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.595
Look, sorry, Dad.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.362
I knew it was you,

23:18.364 --> 23:20.064
playing cat and mouse
with the police

23:20.066 --> 23:23.100
had your name
written all over it.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.537
Gabriel Medeiros,
12 years old.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.172
Food court thing was dumb.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.507
It was lame.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.442
And you can add to that

23:31.444 --> 23:33.911
stupid, rude,

23:33.913 --> 23:36.514
and expensive.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.848
What can I do
to make it up to you?

23:37.850 --> 23:42.586
I get that you're sorry,
and I appreciate that.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.923
But I also get that
you did it for Carter, right?

23:47.893 --> 23:49.794
Look, son...

23:49.796 --> 23:50.828
I don't wanna be
the type of dad

23:50.830 --> 23:54.231
to tell you who
your friends should be.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.635
But I would also think twice
before hanging out with Carter.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.870
I mean, she has a lot
of problems.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.540
She's not a mental case
if that's what you're saying.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.041
Well, she just got out
of the hospital.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.478
She almost overdosed, okay,
she just can't be trusted.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.748
She just lost her mom.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.616
Everyone suffers losses.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.084
It's how we handle them

24:14.086 --> 24:17.755
that says everything
about a person.

24:22.761 --> 24:26.063
Look at this, cloth napkins,
what's the occasion?

24:26.065 --> 24:29.266
I just wanted to have
a really nice family dinner.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.367
Don't you think
it's time to have

24:30.369 --> 24:31.769
a really nice
family dinner?

24:31.771 --> 24:33.637
Yes.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.340
Can you go get everyone?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.576
Guys, dinner!

24:41.313 --> 24:43.047
Is there something
going on?

24:43.049 --> 24:45.249
Totally in the dark.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.587
Best behavior,
I promise.

24:49.589 --> 24:53.057
You know, I think it's because
I'm using the bad controller.

24:53.059 --> 24:53.891
It won't let me jump.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.726
(Max)
We'll trade after dinner.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.094
This looks amazing.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.362
(Carter)
Really does.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.598
I'd be so excited
if I ate red meat.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.533
Hey, you eat croutons,
though, right?

25:02.535 --> 25:04.935
Yes, Max, I eat croutons.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.737
(Elizabeth)
Okay, guys, sit.

25:06.739 --> 25:10.841
Um, I'm sorry, I wanted
this to be a family dinner.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.743
You understand.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.978
Yeah.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.381
It's been really great
having you, but...

25:17.383 --> 25:19.116
All your stuff
is in the living room,

25:19.118 --> 25:22.620
and Carter has all these
new friends now, so...

25:22.622 --> 25:24.121
Why is she doing this?

25:24.123 --> 25:24.889
He helped me cook.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.658
Elizabeth, he can
at least stay for dinner.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.994
Sure, you can stay
for dinner.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.596
No, you're right,
I should go.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.032
Thank you guys
for everything.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.600
I'll get my stuff.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.936
I'm sorry, I can't--
I can't do it.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.839
Stop throwing
my friends out of the house.

25:41.841 --> 25:45.075
Isn't this supposed to be
my house, too?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.744
He stays.

25:46.746 --> 25:50.481
And... you can have your
precious living room back.

25:50.483 --> 25:53.884
He's staying with me
in my room.

25:54.719 --> 25:59.456
Come on Max, it's fine, just
ignore her, that's what I do.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.828
I'll save you
some food.

26:09.834 --> 26:12.069
So much
for family dinner.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.071
We can still enjoy it.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.440
I know I'm going to.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.044
Pass the corn.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.081
Should've been there with me
standing up for Max,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.649
but you were too chicken
to stand up to her.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.618
Is that what I am?
Uh, you were.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.920
Well, I think we were
watching two different plays.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.991
See from your perspective,
she was throwing Max out,

26:33.993 --> 26:38.529
but from mine, she was
pretending to throw Max out.

26:38.531 --> 26:41.932
What are you talking about,
that makes no sense.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.334
She likes Max.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.635
She wants you to
be with Max.

26:44.637 --> 26:48.339
If you're with Max,
then you won't be with Crash.

26:50.809 --> 26:54.645
She played me?
Like a kazoo.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.681
Wow, I underestimated her.

26:57.683 --> 27:01.018
Kind of
didn't work, though.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.419
No?

27:07.459 --> 27:08.926
He's sweet.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.495
(whispering)
You like him.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.430
No!

27:13.432 --> 27:14.965
We've been through this.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.300
I'm not going
through it again.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.803
When it comes to boys,
you win.

27:23.174 --> 27:26.844
Hi, we're looking for someone
who we think lives here?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.545
She looks like this?

27:28.547 --> 27:29.413
Do you know her?

27:29.415 --> 27:31.849
Cat, yeah... 2-3-4.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.283
She lives
in the building?

27:33.285 --> 27:36.220
Not anymore, she moved
a month or so ago.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.656
Said she was gonna
go live with her daughter.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.690
She did?

27:39.692 --> 27:41.825
She did.

27:47.532 --> 27:48.399
She was here.

27:48.401 --> 27:51.769
She's gonna go live
with her daughter.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.203
She's not giving up.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.339
Then neither are we.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.208
Thank you, Gabe.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.045
You've been such
an amazing friend.

28:01.047 --> 28:05.482
If you bump that up a notch,
it gets a little better.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.419
Thank you.

28:08.421 --> 28:11.689
(sighs)

28:11.691 --> 28:13.724
I mean that.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.860
What's this big news
that's so important

28:16.862 --> 28:18.262
we had to talk
about it in person?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.263
Is this about
"Finding Carter?"

28:19.265 --> 28:20.764
Yes, it's about
"Finding Carter."

28:20.766 --> 28:22.966
Okay, before you
go on, I have some news.

28:22.968 --> 28:26.136
A bid just came in
from a publisher.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.171
Are you ready?

28:27.173 --> 28:28.439
Double-- I'm gonna
say it again,

28:28.441 --> 28:29.306
it's my new favorite word.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.675
Double the highest offer
if...

28:31.677 --> 28:34.411
you can get
the kidnapper to talk.

28:34.413 --> 28:38.082
Is there a world in which
that is a possibility?

28:38.084 --> 28:41.018
Well... yes.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.052
Yes, you just said yes.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.489
Yes, it would work with
the idea I'm about to pitch you.

28:45.491 --> 28:46.423
Okay, I'm all ears.

28:46.425 --> 28:49.927
What if I wrote
"Finding Carter" as a novel?

28:49.929 --> 28:51.495
I've heard enough-- no.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.629
Now, just a second.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.932
The fictional story
of a family

28:54.934 --> 28:56.266
reunited with
their long-lost child.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.102
And I, of course, would
change the names--

28:58.104 --> 29:01.004
Still no,
and it's a bigger no.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.040
All this money
that's being offered is great,

29:03.042 --> 29:05.175
but I don't need
that much.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.777
Fiction is what
I've always wanted to write.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.212
This would be
the perfect way in.

29:08.214 --> 29:11.014
David, do you remember how much
you loved your book tour?

29:11.016 --> 29:13.884
People lined up
to get a signed book, huh?

29:13.886 --> 29:16.620
Or do you wanna be the man
that's sitting by the phone,

29:16.622 --> 29:19.857
waiting for it to ring,
knowing when it finally does,

29:19.859 --> 29:22.426
it's just gonna be
bad news.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.761
You remember those calls?

29:23.763 --> 29:25.929
Pass, pass, pass, pass.

29:25.931 --> 29:29.032
Because those are your
two choices, so pick one.

29:29.034 --> 29:29.967
And in the second one,

29:29.969 --> 29:33.003
you owe half a million dollars
to Random House.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.808
See you tomorrow.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.780
You're mad at me.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.680
Yup.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.215
Can I apologize?

29:45.217 --> 29:46.183
Go ahead.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.385
Standing still?

29:50.588 --> 29:51.421
I was an idiot.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.222
I was trying
to impress you.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.725
I don't know why I thought
I had to do that but I did.

29:54.727 --> 29:59.096
And how exactly would teaching
my 12-year-old brother

29:59.098 --> 30:01.598
how to roll
a joint impress me?

30:01.600 --> 30:02.399
I don't know.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.401
He asked me if I like
to play video games.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.936
I don't get a lot
of chances to do that,

30:05.938 --> 30:07.771
but he's such a cool kid,
I wanted someone

30:07.773 --> 30:11.108
in your family
to like me...

30:11.110 --> 30:14.144
Like I said,
I'm an idiot,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.313
but I'm sorry.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.149
Truly, I'm sorry.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.787
It's okay, I'm not mad.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.658
Good.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.125
Thank you.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.928
Look, I know I blew
my chance to get to know you.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.896
At least my record's clean.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.399
Who said you blew it?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.700
Elizabeth.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.570
Exactly.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.448
Dude, I'm sorry.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.618
You know, Crash.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.086
This was inevitable.

30:56.088 --> 30:59.122
No, I'm inevitable.

30:59.124 --> 31:03.594
I'm just not
what she wants right now.

31:03.596 --> 31:05.596
(no audio)

31:21.546 --> 31:24.681
(Carter)
"I'm going to die."

31:26.451 --> 31:29.987
Why would you put something
like that on your body?

31:29.989 --> 31:32.789
(rain pattering)

31:32.791 --> 31:35.125
Because it's true.

31:36.761 --> 31:41.865
It's the only really true thing
I've ever heard in my life.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.401
Oh.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.770
I've been told
a lot of lies.

31:46.772 --> 31:47.905
Only lies, actually.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.974
None of that matters.

31:50.976 --> 31:53.610
Come on, it's my whole life,
how can that not matter?

31:53.612 --> 31:54.745
It's not
your whole life.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.080
All that matters
is what you do

31:57.082 --> 32:01.118
from this moment on.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.152
At least, that's what
they told me

32:02.154 --> 32:05.088
when I aged out
of my last detention center.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.458
<i>(police sirens)</i>

32:08.460 --> 32:09.293
God, I hate that sound.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.328
Always sounds like
Elizabeth's calling me home

32:11.330 --> 32:13.030
for dinner or something.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.800
Yeah, I'm not crazy
about it either.

32:25.843 --> 32:28.011
Oh! What-- oh.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.281
I told you, dude,
it wasn't the controller.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.017
You know, I'm glad
you didn't leave.

32:35.687 --> 32:39.189
But pretty soon, I'm--
I am gonna have to.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.792
Why, are your parents
worried about you?

32:41.794 --> 32:43.593
I'm worried about me.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.162
What do you mean?

32:45.164 --> 32:47.030
I mean, I'm not in school,

32:47.032 --> 32:48.198
I'm not working.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.400
I'm sleeping on
my ex-girlfriend's

32:50.402 --> 32:51.368
bedroom floor.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.570
So pretty much all I got
going for me right now

32:53.572 --> 32:57.174
is whooping
your zombie ass.

32:57.176 --> 33:03.080
So, uh, I mean, if you're not
Carter's boyfriend, who is?

33:05.183 --> 33:06.049
I'm not sure.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.651
Seems like there's
a lot of guys

33:07.653 --> 33:09.386
filling out
that application though.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.489
It's not that guy
Crash, is it?

33:12.491 --> 33:14.791
You don't like him?

33:14.793 --> 33:15.192
No.

33:15.194 --> 33:18.161
'Cause he got you
in trouble with your dad?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.129
No, because he told me

33:19.131 --> 33:22.766
by the time he was my age,
he killed a guy.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.168
You know that's not true.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.238
Something like that,
you'd be in jail forever.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.907
He was just showing off
for you.

33:30.909 --> 33:31.541
For me?

33:31.543 --> 33:34.344
Why would anybody
wanna show off for me?

33:34.346 --> 33:35.879
Are you kidding me, man?

33:35.881 --> 33:37.714
You're hip,
you're cool.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.548
I am?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.383
Well, pretty close.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.985
But you gotta let
those bangs grow out.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.495
<i>(video game beeps)</i>

33:51.497 --> 33:55.132
Oh, that's not cool, man.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.135
Just because we feel like
they're coming after us,

33:58.137 --> 34:00.971
doesn't mean like we
have to drive like they are.

34:00.973 --> 34:05.242
(passing car honking)

34:05.244 --> 34:09.312
Unless they are
coming after us.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.982
Are they?

34:11.984 --> 34:12.682
Maybe.

34:12.684 --> 34:16.119
Okay, I probably should've
asked you this before,

34:16.121 --> 34:17.187
but is this
your car, Crash?

34:17.189 --> 34:19.856
Can you tell which direction
the sirens are coming from?

34:19.858 --> 34:22.025
Oh, my God.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.760
All right, I'm gonna
take that as a no.

34:23.762 --> 34:24.728
I need you to pull over.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.997
I can't.
Crash, pull over.

34:26.999 --> 34:28.698
Car must have
a LoJack system.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.467
Pull over!

34:30.469 --> 34:34.371
Let me out
of this car, Crash, now!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.741
<i>(police siren blaring)</i>

34:37.743 --> 34:41.011
(tires squealing)

34:57.095 --> 34:58.295
Hi.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.496
(sniffling)

34:59.498 --> 35:01.765
It's me.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.367
I screwed up.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.069
Ugh, what a day.

35:06.071 --> 35:09.473
I was just seconds away from
being caught in a stolen car

35:09.475 --> 35:11.374
which, I swear to God,
you have to believe me,

35:11.376 --> 35:13.110
I would never have gotten into
in the first place

35:13.112 --> 35:15.479
if I had any idea,
but why would you believe me?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.914
I don't even believe I did
something so stupid.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.785
I am such an idiot,
I'm such an idiot.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.019
Carter--
No, I know.

35:23.021 --> 35:26.423
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.592
I'm so sorry.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.926
That's like the least
useful sentence

35:29.928 --> 35:31.194
in the whole
entire English language,

35:31.196 --> 35:34.030
but it's the only one I can
think of right now.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.066
Gosh, she's
just gonna kill me.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.668
She's just gonna kill me,
and I don't blame her,

35:38.670 --> 35:39.536
she should.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.939
She's not home.

35:42.941 --> 35:43.740
What?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.509
She's at work.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.943
You don't have to
say a thing.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.079
She never has to know.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.814
(sighs)

35:50.816 --> 35:53.817
Thank God.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.052
Thank God.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.606
Dad?

36:16.608 --> 36:20.377
Wow, it feels
so weird saying that.

36:20.379 --> 36:24.147
Dad.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.516
Thank you.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.590
Thank you.

36:33.592 --> 36:38.395
♪

36:38.629 --> 36:43.133
I'm a dad,
that's what we do.

36:44.569 --> 36:48.939
You know, I think
this is our first hug.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.577
I think you're right.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.326
Bird, I thought
you were my friend.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.427
I thought you were mine.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.895
(shouting over
each other)

37:11.897 --> 37:13.763
You said that I would never
have to make this call.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.800
If you could
just trust me.

37:19.637 --> 37:21.571
Come back.
I will.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.339
I can't--
I can't do this.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.709
Not unless you tell me
it's over with David.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.344
Hi, Max.
