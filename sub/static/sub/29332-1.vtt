Orlando, I want you to know

00:51.185 --> 00:54.119
that it brings me so much peace

00:54.655 --> 00:57.222
to know that you're going
to move into my home

00:57.558 --> 00:58.657

01:15.576 --> 01:18.243
Remember when I took you camping

01:18.245 --> 01:21.080
up to Mosquito Lake
for the Fourth of July?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.315
Sure, but of course.

01:23.317 --> 01:29.388
I want you to go back on
the next Fourth of July

01:30.791 --> 01:34.293
and spread my ashes

01:35.329 --> 01:38.831
on the water of Mosquito Lake.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.833
Can you do that for me?

Are you as excited as
I am about your trip

03:45.559 --> 03:46.525
to California tomorrow night?

03:46.527 --> 03:52.431
I am so excited,

God, I can't wait

Oh, honey, I want your
trip to be perfect.

I've detailed my entire
house just for you.

And don't you worry
about anything because

04:01.909 --> 04:03.875
I have taken
care of everything.

04:04.979 --> 04:07.446
It's hard to believe
that we've known each
other for six months

04:07.448 --> 04:10.582
-and we've only seen
each other once.
-It's crazy, isn't it?

Yes.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.491
Yes.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.561
Karen, are you still
planning on going through

04:22.563 --> 04:23.729
with that trip of yours?

04:23.731 --> 04:27.499
[sighs] Mama, why can't
you be more supportive?

04:27.968 --> 04:31.303
We did not pay for braces
on your teeth

04:31.305 --> 04:32.871
for you to end up with
a French teacher,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.407
who at 35 is still a bachelor.

04:35.409 --> 04:40.012
Mom, he is a French professor
of literature, and he's 33.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.947
You forget, girl,
I met him once.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.682
And I'm telling you there is
something not right with him.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.885
He is a very responsible man.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.787
Responsible? [laughs]

04:48.789 --> 04:51.323
Look, okay, I'll
make you a deal.

04:51.325 --> 04:55.394
If he doesn't show up at the
airport on time to pick you up,

04:55.396 --> 04:57.496
you're going to get on
the next plane back to DC.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.999
-Promise me, Karen.
-I promise.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.067

to you, too.

-That's a nice dog.
-What's his name?
-Food.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.501
-Food?
-Yeah. I rescued him and
it's the only word

06:09.503 --> 06:10.702
I can get him to respond to.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.537
So where are you heading?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.941
Oh, oh, oh, I'm just
uh, here for a day hike.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.377
Nice, nice.
Do you come here often?

06:18.379 --> 06:20.812
Well, when I was a
kid with my father,

06:20.814 --> 06:21.980
every Fourth of July.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.050
You know, I noticed
those marmots

06:25.652 --> 06:27.686
are still getting under
the car there, just eating
through everything.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.489
It's actually not the marmots.
They haven't been a problem
this year.

06:30.491 --> 06:34.993
It's this uh... this ferret
that is causing me the
prob-- there he is!

-Around here?
-Oh, gosh, no.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.806
Down at the bottom by
the Welcome Center.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.508
Oh. Oh, I don't think so.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.910
I'm kind of here to
get away from all that.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.980
But thanks for the invite,
Ranger Cantor.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.182
Oh, [chuckles] you can
call me Ranger Sarah.

to shoot George?

Oh, hey, you decided to see
the fireworks after all.

No, listen, someone
took all my things,

11:03.430 --> 11:05.897
my car keys, my wallet,
my cell phone.

Yeah, I'm going to need
to see some ID first.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.841
No, you don't understand,
I have nothing.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.144
Everything I owned was
in that backpack.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.912
I need your help, please.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.380
I'm sorry, but I can't
give it to you

11:22.382 --> 11:23.782
without proper ID, sir.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.420
May I ask, where
did you find it?

11:28.422 --> 11:30.889
Oh, right there by that
very girly car.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.892
Okay, that's right,
but that's my car.

-Oh, [laughs] really?
-Don't you remember

11:36.463 --> 11:39.864
when I parked it right here,
you and I met a couple
of hours ago?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.300
Okay, yeah, but that
doesn't mean
it's registered to you, sir.

11:43.704 --> 11:47.806
I'll tell you what, tell you
what. I will give you my
number, and you can dial it,

11:47.808 --> 11:50.241
and you can hear
my voice message.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.211
Yeah no, that's not gonna work
because cell phones
don't work up here.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.212
See, no bars.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.948
Ah, Food, stop it. Food!

11:58.251 --> 12:00.218
I'll show you some pictures.
I'll show you some pictures,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.220
and then you will know
that the phone is mine.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.789
Okay, I've got some questions
first, sir.

12:04.791 --> 12:05.724
What's your name?

-It's my girlfriend.
-Oay, look, I'll tell you what

12:38.291 --> 12:41.359
I'm gonna do. I am gonna
write you a report.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.262
Maybe someone will find your
things and turn them in.
Going to get to it.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.531
Maybe? I'll freeze out
here tonight.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.467
What am I supposed to do?
Hey, what about that ferret?

12:49.469 --> 12:53.271
I mean, that thing will just
chew right through my new car.
No, no, I need your help.

from the airport tomorrow,

12:55.909 --> 12:57.542
and I cannot be late.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.978
Show some compassion.
Can you give me a ride?

12:59.980 --> 13:04.115
Oh, park regulations prohibit
anyone but park employees

13:04.117 --> 13:05.216
but park employees from
riding in official vehicles

13:05.218 --> 13:07.252
within national parks, sir.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.021
Maybe you'll find a ride
with someone else.

13:10.023 --> 13:14.559
Happy Fourth. [clicks teeth]
Independence. Come on.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.395
Maybe I'll burn this
damned park down,

13:17.397 --> 13:19.430
and then that will give you
a reason to call the cops.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.100

14:22.329 --> 14:25.463
What? Who the fuck cares and
who the fuck is this?

14:25.465 --> 14:29.300
And the name ain't no Jerome,
understand? The name is Cowboy.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.539
Oh, come on, Jerome.
We spent nine and a half
months in a cell together

14:34.541 --> 14:41.379
-and you already forgot.
-Oh, shit, [laughs] it's
that Crazy Cracker Dakota.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.922
And the name ain't no Jerome.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.492
I told you the name
is now Cowboy.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.594
Anyway, that's where
this guy lives,

14:56.596 --> 14:59.530
and well, he's black like you,

14:59.532 --> 15:03.401
and I thought you'd know him,
and that whole thing.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.204
That's some real racist shit.
And what are you talking
about, man?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.672
I need you to focus
in now, okay?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.440

<i> that you told me</i>

15:15.048 --> 15:17.115
that if I ever came
across something

15:17.117 --> 15:19.417
that I thought would
be of your interest,

15:19.419 --> 15:23.021
that I should call you and
then we'd split it 50/50.

15:24.090 --> 15:28.293
Yeah, I know that's all true and
everything man, but you being
real unpatriotic right now.

15:28.295 --> 15:32.430
This is the Fourth of July,
understand? <i> This is like</i>
<i> the birth of our nation</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:37.535
and I'm celebrating the
birth like a newborn baby
sucking on some American titties

15:37.537 --> 15:39.470
and some Russian titties, too,
be honest with you.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.440
Oh, come on, you're still
doing gigs, aren't you?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.542
I've been looking
for an opportunity

15:44.544 --> 15:46.577
like this for a long time now,

15:46.579 --> 15:49.480
and mainly just to show you
that I'd be a great partner.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.050
<i> Well, you could tell</i>
<i> a real cowboy</i>

15:52.052 --> 15:53.651
by the kind of
horse he's riding.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.087
I'm talking about riding
your ass, girl.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.523
I'm talking about
riding your ass.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.559
Hey, man, this dude
better be worth it.

16:01.561 --> 16:06.564
[laughs] This dude
is worth gold.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.100
<i> Alright then, looks like</i>

16:41.267 --> 16:42.567
I ran into some problems.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.206
What, I can hardly hear you.
Did you say you have a problem?

16:48.208 --> 16:51.175
Oh, no, no, it's nothing
that you need to worry about.

16:51.177 --> 16:55.313

need you to call Greyhound

situation all day.

Are you cold? I was spreading
my father's ashes

-It's beautiful stars.

-very beautiful night.
-And do you feel the air?

18:39.319 --> 18:41.586
The air is very fresh,
it's very fresh.

18:41.588 --> 18:46.424
Really, I need to get home,
I have to, what is this?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.693
-It's a bus.
-A bus?

I don't know anything
about the ceremony,

19:14.320 --> 19:18.222
but I was kind of wondering
if you fellow travelers

19:18.224 --> 19:19.891
would help me get
back to San Jose.

19:19.893 --> 19:23.861

19:33.773 --> 19:36.674
what you've done or
where you've been.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.310
What's important
is where you are,

19:39.312 --> 19:42.747
and you have the right
to be here. [laughs]

19:43.783 --> 19:46.918
Oh, yeah, the big picture,
I get that.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.354
It's kind of this
existential idea,

19:50.356 --> 19:55.393
which actually is basically
French, right?

19:55.395 --> 19:57.528

Yeah, didn't I tell you
I'd come through?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.928
That's one of the things
you said, yeah.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.564
Mm-hmm.
Well, we got a deal, Jerome?

20:34.300 --> 20:37.468
No, man. I got out of
my ho-filled hot tub,

20:37.737 --> 20:41.839
put on my boots,
brought two of my guys
out here and their truck,

20:41.841 --> 20:44.575
just to look at your
ugly ass face.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.677
And the name is Cowboy, asshole.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.714
Well, now, I don't want
to call you Asshole.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.783
-Those are nice boots, though.
-Stop looking at my boots.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.453
-Stop looking at the boots.
-Well, I like them.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.887
Let me see the fucking wallet.

21:00.026 --> 21:00.958
Yeah, uh-hum!

21:01.761 --> 21:03.027
We said 50/50.

Be cool, man, alright?

I'm cool, you cool.

You cool?

Then I'm cool.

Mm-hmm.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.838
Oh, brother, huh?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.908
Mr. Orlando, where does this
dude live? Where's his house?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.979
Right there. Why do you think
I'm parked there?

21:22.415 --> 21:23.781
I see. Did you stake it out?

21:23.983 --> 21:25.516
Someone might be home.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.550
It's dark in there.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.519
Are you afraid of the dark?

21:28.521 --> 21:30.688
-You look like a mountain man.
-No.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.025
Okay, then, take the keys,
go inside,

21:34.027 --> 21:36.594
-and see if there's
anything in there to take.
-Me?

-Yes, you.
-No. Isn't that supposed
to be your job?

21:39.766 --> 21:43.534
Alright, alright. Let me just
break down this work
relationship to you, alright?

and what I do is
I provide transportation

21:47.307 --> 21:48.839

21:48.841 --> 21:50.975
And you, my friend,
you are Dakota,

secure said goods,

secure them in
that house, brother.

'Cause he told me he
was just going to go

in a big sweepstakes,

Oh, yeah.
You know, I had an uncle, he's
defunct now, my Tío Chato,

24:46.486 --> 24:48.152
but anyway, that's
another story.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.154
Like I was saying, he
liked to get involved

24:50.156 --> 24:52.490
with a whole bunch of
charities to the point

24:52.492 --> 24:54.658
that his wife wouldn't
even talk to him anymore

24:54.660 --> 24:56.527
'cause he never paid
attention to her.

24:56.529 --> 25:00.764
It became like a, what do
you call that, a compulsion.

-So she finally
ended up divorcing him.

the old furniture away.

to the spirit world.

Well, I don't need
to go that far.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.652
San Jose will do.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.854
This plant is from
the Brazilian forest.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.290
-I got it from a shaman.
-Oh, well, this, listen,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.760
this looks really fun
and all but I,

27:42.762 --> 27:44.995
I really just need to know
when you're planning
on heading back,

27:45.431 --> 27:47.831
you know, just like
ballpark estimate.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.668
Yes, it's all natural.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.237
With all due respects
to your religion,

27:54.040 --> 27:56.373
I mean, it is a religion.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.108
I'm just not really
into this kind of stuff.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.376
It's called virola,

28:00.046 --> 28:02.212
extracted from trees
of the genus.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.082
And what does the plant do?

28:05.084 --> 28:07.951
Its principal psychoactive
ingredients

28:08.120 --> 28:11.989
include powerful tryptamine
alkaloids and beta carbolines.

28:12.758 --> 28:13.857
But what does it do?

28:15.061 --> 28:17.361
It promotes the ascension
of the spirit.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.298
-through the mucous membranes.

No, I'm not, I'm not afraid.

Oh, my head's spinning.

-Oh, I'm falling apart.
-Within the next 100 years,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.353
you have to ask yourself,

28:43.355 --> 28:46.290
what type of planet
are we going to be

28:46.959 --> 28:50.360
or are we all going to
be planets ourselves?

28:51.497 --> 28:54.832
-Huh?
-Survival is not
a guarantee, man.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.334

-Oh, that might matter.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.290
No, I'm going to hold
onto this, okay.
I might need it.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.460
-Now what?
-Well, now you go home,
get yourself a good night rest

29:56.462 --> 29:59.029
-and I'll call you as
things progress.
-Where is my cut?

29:59.832 --> 30:01.799
Now, we are equal partners,
remember?

30:02.168 --> 30:04.101
Look, Dakota, I hate to
say this to you, man,

30:04.103 --> 30:06.336
and I don't want this
to sound offensive,

30:06.338 --> 30:07.905
but if we're going to
be equal partners,

30:07.907 --> 30:10.307
you got to step up your
clothes game, man.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.042

supposed to mean?

30:12.044 --> 30:15.245

-It's a rugged look.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.814
It's a horrible look.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.567
When was the last

30:20.568 --> 30:21.884
Man to man, when was the
last time you got laid?

30:22.121 --> 30:23.987
-Ah, well, uh--
-I guess it was in prison.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.824
Look at me eye to eye,
was it in prison?

I'm just saying there's
a method to this madness

30:28.928 --> 30:30.194

30:30.196 --> 30:32.429
Here's what I want
you to do, partner.

I want you to take
$100, right here.

a makeover.

-Absolutely.

30:49.582 --> 30:52.382
This is your Cowboy.
Of course, we've got
an understanding.

back in that cell,

Oh, Officer, I,

32:16.969 --> 32:20.203
I lost my wallet and my car
keys. And my car is still there,

32:20.205 --> 32:22.039
but I had to go home
and get my spare keys.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.708
I was just walking down
the hill to the main road.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.209

32:26.211 --> 32:28.512
No, my ID is in my wallet, sir.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.382
So what do you do for a living?

32:32.384 --> 32:35.185
I'm a professor of
French literature.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.387
That's how French people
dress for class?

32:37.389 --> 32:40.357
You know, Officer, there's
a certain odor back here.

32:40.359 --> 32:43.293
Oh yeah, like what?
Like a jockstrap flew
out of a donkey's ass

-That's, that's very
perceptive of you.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.332
You have a way with
words, Officer.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.969
Yeah. No, actually, a guy
threw up back out there
a couple months ago.

leaves a very robust aroma,

32:56.308 --> 32:59.142

you've got that going on.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.678
Like to keep it that way
for our special VIP guests.

33:03.082 --> 33:06.216

there to San Jose, hitchhiking?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.518
Oh, any way I can.

Okay, tell you what.

I'm going to leave you
in this old country back road

at least no one will bother you
and you've got a better
chance of getting a ride.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.696
No, no, no, I appreciate
that, Officer.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.600
Well, I have absolutely
no reason to believe anything
you've told me,

33:23.602 --> 33:26.036

our country's birthday,

give you a break.

39:50.922 --> 39:54.924
another little thing popped up
that I've got to deal with
at this moment in time.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.094
Why don't you go and
procure that automobile?

39:58.096 --> 40:00.897
Then, I, your partner,
will sell it.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.001
-You've got it, partner!
-Yeah!

40:05.003 --> 40:06.803
-[both laughing]
-Alright.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.672
[Dakota] No problem there,
not a problem.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.673
Idiot.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.412
[knocking at door]

40:15.847 --> 40:17.580
[door lock buzzes]

40:21.820 --> 40:22.419
Ladies.

40:26.558 --> 40:27.490
How you doing?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.195
Ah, well.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.629
-Good morning.
-Good morning to you, sir.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.433
Is there something specific
that you're looking for?

40:36.802 --> 40:39.169
As a matter of fact, there is.

40:39.771 --> 40:43.473
I'm going to be affirming
my love for my lady,

40:43.475 --> 40:45.141
and I'd like to see a diamond,

40:45.143 --> 40:47.811
in the form of an
engagement ring.

40:47.813 --> 40:52.215
Wise choice. Diamonds are still
a girl's best friend, young man.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.485
-That is true.
-I'm Mr. Feldman, and you are?

40:55.487 --> 40:58.188
Mr. Leal, Orlando Leal,

40:58.190 --> 41:00.757
like Neal but with an L.

41:00.759 --> 41:01.991
-Mr. Leal.
-Mm-hmm.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.095
-[chips crunching]
-[traffic humming]

41:07.065 --> 41:09.499
You know, "Initiative is doing

41:09.501 --> 41:11.234
the right thing without
being told."

41:13.071 --> 41:14.003
Victor Hugo.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.073
[Feldman] These are straight
out of the oven,

41:17.075 --> 41:19.909
metaphorically speaking,
of course.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.845
I just love this piece.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.880
Oh yes, I see why you love it.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.648
That is something to be loved.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.750
Now, what is the price on this?

41:27.752 --> 41:31.187
-Oh, that's $2250.
-Oh $22,500?

41:31.189 --> 41:35.091
No, no, no, no, $2,250.

41:35.694 --> 41:36.860
Oh.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.929
Oh, Mr. Feldman, my woman is

41:39.931 --> 41:41.664
so special and I,

41:43.635 --> 41:45.835
I love her so much.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.872
I just hoping that I
could find something

41:48.874 --> 41:49.973
that's as special as she is.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.209
How special did you want to go?

41:53.211 --> 41:57.280
Well, I think we could afford
to add another special zero

41:57.282 --> 42:01.084
to the end of that $2,250.
Let me show you a picture
of my girl.

42:01.086 --> 42:04.621
Her name is Karen,
and I keep this little photo
of her everywhere I go.

42:04.623 --> 42:07.991
Oh, I understand.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.226
I think I know just
what you're looking for.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.529
-I'll be right back.
-I will wait here.

42:14.799 --> 42:18.167
You ladies look beautiful today.
I don't know if either
of you are into cowboys,

42:18.169 --> 42:19.969
but I'd like to be into you.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.205
-In your dreams.
-Let's just go.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.140
Alright, see you later, then.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.109
-[door chime rings]
-[Cowboy grunts]

42:26.578 --> 42:28.044
[funky music]

42:29.180 --> 42:30.113
Hello.

42:31.783 --> 42:34.317
[crows cawing]

42:41.593 --> 42:42.692
Wake up!

42:42.694 --> 42:47.964
Look at what time it is, man,
you and your stupid idea
of getting high.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.700
We're dead.
Fuck, what now, Tato?

42:52.103 --> 42:53.803
I have to pee badly.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.139
-You kidding me?
-When nature calls.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.343
-I have to pee, too. Hurry up.
-Okay.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.687
-Hey, CJ?
-What now, Tato?

43:11.623 --> 43:12.655
Aren't you hungry?

43:12.657 --> 43:16.359
What is wrong with you?
Man, how do you stay so skinny?

43:16.795 --> 43:17.727
Yoga.

43:21.199 --> 43:22.832
Alright, man, let's eat.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.200
Let's go make some food.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.936
[upbeat music]

43:34.946 --> 43:36.946
[Feldman]
This is top of the line,

43:38.350 --> 43:42.752
-$22,995.
-Hmm.

43:42.754 --> 43:46.823
Now, that is exactly
what I am talking about.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.358
What's the resale value
on something like this?

43:49.628 --> 43:51.928
I mean, just in case, you
know, she doesn't want it,

43:51.930 --> 43:56.032
or I suddenly get the
Alzheimer's and she
decides to leave?

43:56.034 --> 43:59.836
Well, I can assure you,
it will retain its value.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.971
In fact, its value will
increase over time.

44:02.641 --> 44:06.175
Well, Mr. Feldman, we
have got ourselves a deal.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.877
-Oh, wonderful.
-Indeed.

44:07.879 --> 44:10.647
Your fiancée will
be very pleased.

44:11.783 --> 44:13.983
And what size is she?

44:13.985 --> 44:15.818
36 double D.

44:21.059 --> 44:25.161
-I meant ring size.
-Oh, oh, finger size.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.664
That would be not important
right now.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.432
I'm sure this will fit.
I'll just take it.

44:29.434 --> 44:31.868
Okay, fine. You know,
she can always come back

44:31.870 --> 44:34.237
-and have it resized any time.
-Yeah, sure.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.872
Now, how will you be paying?

44:35.874 --> 44:38.107
I'd like to pay in plastic, sir.

44:38.109 --> 44:39.776
-Mm-hmm.
-There you are.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.310
Mm-hmm. And I'll of course,

44:41.312 --> 44:42.945
I'll need
to see some identification.

44:42.947 --> 44:43.946
[Cowboy] Naturally,
you would, sir.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.182
So...

44:51.923 --> 44:55.425
-It's interesting.
-Oh, you're not about to
racially profile me, are you,

44:56.194 --> 44:57.727
'cause that was before
I, you know,

44:57.729 --> 44:59.996
kind of modernized myself.

44:59.998 --> 45:01.464
That was before, you
know, the makeover.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.268
Of course.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.713
-[chuckles].
-You're approved.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.114
Oh, good, goody, goody,
goody, goody, goody.

45:18.116 --> 45:20.283
-If you would just sign here.
-Okay.

45:21.453 --> 45:22.385
Alright.

45:23.922 --> 45:26.456
Karen and I, we met on a
French literature blog.

45:27.959 --> 45:31.127
It was an intense discussion
on <i> Mathilde's Life</i>

45:31.129 --> 45:32.495
by Guy de Maupassant.

45:32.497 --> 45:37.967
<i>And I wrote, "Mathilde believes</i>
<i> she deserves another life."</i>

45:37.969 --> 45:39.802
<i> She wants to be envied</i>
<i> and sought after,</i>

45:39.804 --> 45:42.171
<i> and these are things that</i>
<i> people just identify with."</i>

45:43.374 --> 45:46.776
Oh, but that's when
the magic happened.

45:50.048 --> 45:51.347
Because Karen, she wrote,

45:51.349 --> 45:54.083
[Karen voiceover]
<i> "The difference</i>
<i> is that some people</i>

45:54.085 --> 45:57.386
<i> aren't willing</i>
<i> to make the sacrifices...</i>

45:57.388 --> 46:03.025
<i> for one night of pleasure."</i>

46:03.027 --> 46:05.394
In such a poetic way.

46:05.396 --> 46:08.131
I mean, that's when
I knew, I mean,

46:08.133 --> 46:09.866
that we were just meant
for each other.

46:09.868 --> 46:14.070
She's perfect for me. Ah.

46:14.472 --> 46:18.040
You know, CJ, it doesn't get
better in life than this.

46:18.042 --> 46:20.309
We're fucked, man, we're fucked.

46:21.312 --> 46:24.113
Why do bad things happen to
good people all the time?

46:28.186 --> 46:29.836
I knew that when I spread
the ashes it was illegal.

46:29.837 --> 46:31.487
You know, I probably shouldn't
have called my dad an asshole,
but for goodness sake,

46:31.489 --> 46:33.289
I'm just a lover of
French literature.

46:33.291 --> 46:37.059
I'm just a lover, not
a fighter, that's it!

46:37.061 --> 46:38.561
-I love French--
-[slaps thuds]

46:38.563 --> 46:39.495
Hey!

46:40.265 --> 46:41.564
I said I wasn't a fighter.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.368
-Oh, but that--
-[truck rumbling]

46:45.370 --> 46:48.004
Hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:48.006 --> 46:51.207
Hey, guys, guys, guys.
I lost my car keys.

46:51.209 --> 46:52.942
I just need a ride to San Jose.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.944
That's it, just to San Jose.

46:55.180 --> 46:57.013
[lighthearted music]

46:57.482 --> 46:58.881
Good boy, Food.

47:03.087 --> 47:05.087
[truck rumbling]

47:11.896 --> 47:13.362
[suspenseful music]

47:13.364 --> 47:15.264
How are you doing, sweet meat?

47:17.035 --> 47:20.002
-[Dakota laughs]
-[funky music]

47:20.872 --> 47:22.371
We're headed to San Jose,
aren't we?

47:23.308 --> 47:24.240
San Jose?

47:27.178 --> 47:28.344
[honking blares]

47:28.346 --> 47:31.480
[lighthearted music]

47:37.956 --> 47:40.289
Alright, just San Jose.

47:44.462 --> 47:48.431
Do you think I got where
I am by begging?

47:48.433 --> 47:50.399
Get a job, assclown.

47:50.401 --> 47:53.169
[Dakota laughing]

47:57.976 --> 48:00.476
[engine spluttering]

48:05.149 --> 48:06.315
What the hell?

48:08.119 --> 48:11.187
Why you click beast,
clank slacking...

48:13.558 --> 48:15.191
Ha-ha-ha!

48:16.594 --> 48:17.526
Ha!

48:18.196 --> 48:20.496
[steam hissing]

48:22.233 --> 48:23.165
Woo-hoo.

48:24.135 --> 48:25.134
Woo-hoo.

48:29.908 --> 48:32.475
[birds chirping]

48:47.959 --> 48:50.426
Six, that's all you get me?

48:52.063 --> 48:53.396
How am I going to run business

48:53.398 --> 48:55.231
if people don't want
to work, huh?

49:07.145 --> 49:07.977
Are those sandwiches?

49:12.216 --> 49:15.985
-Is this whole grain?
-Yeah, I think so.

49:15.987 --> 49:18.321
Ugh, oh, I'm famished.

49:18.323 --> 49:20.623
You don't know how long
I was out there, mmm.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.391
Do you have any hand sanitizer?

49:24.329 --> 49:26.495
-Here, wear this.
-Hm?

49:26.731 --> 49:27.697
[phone ringing]

49:29.567 --> 49:31.400
[phone ringing]

49:31.402 --> 49:33.002
Don't answer it.

49:33.004 --> 49:35.271
Let the message go to speaker.

49:36.975 --> 49:38.541
[CJ] <i> CJ here, leave a message.</i>

49:39.510 --> 49:44.580
-[comical music]
-[Dakota gasping]

50:09.040 --> 50:10.506
[Cowboy] <i> CJ, it's</i> Caballo.

50:11.109 --> 50:12.708
<i> Yeah, that's the only word</i>
<i> I know in Spanish, man.</i>

50:12.710 --> 50:14.343
<i> Look here, I'm on</i>
<i> my way to storage.</i>

50:14.345 --> 50:16.278
<i> Make sure that you</i>
<i> both are there</i>

50:16.280 --> 50:19.682
<i> with the truck and the goods</i>
<i> so I can pay you all.</i>

50:19.684 --> 50:21.317
<i> -Cowboy, out.</i>
-I told you!

50:21.319 --> 50:23.219
-Tato, I told you, man.
-[Tato whimpers]

50:24.322 --> 50:25.554
We are dead men.

50:26.224 --> 50:29.291
This Cowboy, he's little,
but he's vicious.

50:29.293 --> 50:32.128
-You know why he wears
those cowboy boots?
-Nuh-uh.

50:32.130 --> 50:34.063
I heard a story about
this dude named Manny

50:34.065 --> 50:36.499
who tried to rip up some
of Cowboy's shit.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.467
Cowboy kicked him in
the balls so hard

50:38.469 --> 50:40.302
they came out of his throat.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.138
Out his mouth?

50:42.707 --> 50:43.672
Both of them.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.543
-[Tato gags]
-[musical sting]

50:48.813 --> 50:51.080
Come on, let's go, everybody,
let's go.

50:51.082 --> 50:52.748
The sun's going down.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.550
Sir, Orlando Leal.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.586
Okay, I just want to express
my gratitude for all your help.

50:57.588 --> 51:00.489
Really, I'm so grateful.
If you give me your address,

51:00.491 --> 51:03.292
I insist on reimbursing you
for any of your expenses.

51:03.294 --> 51:05.361
You talk too much, you work now.

51:08.833 --> 51:12.301
Oh, obviously there's
been some kind of mistake.
I'm not here to work.

51:12.303 --> 51:15.571
You don't work, why
do you eat my food?
Maria, give him a bag.

51:16.607 --> 51:19.809
Well, sir, I thought that this
was a charity that was for
distressed travelers.

51:19.811 --> 51:22.178
I mean, I do volunteer
work at my church.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.079
No, hey no, hey!

51:23.081 --> 51:26.348
This has been a mistake,
I'm not here for any work.

51:26.350 --> 51:28.684
No mistake, no charity,
you work.

51:28.686 --> 51:32.455
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, okay?
No, I will reimburse you
when I get my wallet.

51:32.457 --> 51:34.824
Hey, hey, hey, no,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.860
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

51:37.862 --> 51:40.229
Maria, go get my gun.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.875
Hmm, what are you grateful
for today?

52:28.579 --> 52:31.714
[Dakota] Today,
not a fucking lot of much.

52:35.453 --> 52:38.921
-Anything to share?
-[Dakota whimpers]

52:40.224 --> 52:42.258
Because we know how to help you.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.460
[Dakota] I'm not sharing.

52:46.430 --> 52:49.365

53:26.804 --> 53:28.304
Oh, oh, it's me.

Karen, it's you.

No French?

53:42.853 --> 53:44.920
So, what are you wearing?

53:45.957 --> 53:47.389
Shorts and a tank top.

53:47.825 --> 53:49.458

53:50.361 --> 53:52.728
Yeah, I've been running.

[Karen moans and laughs]

Oh, yeah.

54:02.740 --> 54:06.508
-I'm all steamed up.
-Mm.

54:07.411 --> 54:11.914
Do you remember the first
time we had sex?
It was over the phone.

54:11.916 --> 54:14.984
Yeah, French literature, you
know, can be quite a turn-on.

54:16.354 --> 54:19.021
No, baby, you were a turn-on.

54:20.491 --> 54:22.291
So listen, I don't have to be to

54:22.293 --> 54:23.859
the airport for another
few hours,

54:23.861 --> 54:26.862
and I'm all packed up
and ready to go.

54:29.333 --> 54:30.466
Are you...

54:31.035 --> 54:32.401
touching yourself?

54:35.539 --> 54:38.340
Karen, Karen, can you hear me?

54:39.443 --> 54:40.409

-What?

55:17.481 --> 55:20.516
Are you kidding me? Oh, no.

Uhn-uh! You all three
better not be working together
to mess with my stuff.

55:24.755 --> 55:27.589
You'd better not be messing
with the Cowboy's game.

55:27.591 --> 55:29.425
Don't nobody mess with Cowboy!

55:29.427 --> 55:31.460
Nobody mess with Cowboy!

55:34.465 --> 55:36.365
Oh, my God.

They were really sloppy
these charity people.

-Irma.
-Hey, congratulations on
the sweepstakes, dude.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.947
-What sweepstakes?
-The new furniture.

55:52.683 --> 55:55.984
So you saw who did this?

55:55.986 --> 56:00.089
Saw them? I helped them,
and donated some stuff, too.

56:00.091 --> 56:01.757
Oh yeah, we all did.

56:02.993 --> 56:07.129
Irma, I was robbed.
They robbed me.

56:07.798 --> 56:08.931
They took all my shit.

56:08.933 --> 56:10.866
Irma, how could you?

56:11.869 --> 56:13.369
[Tato] So what's next,<i> Jefe</i> ?

56:13.771 --> 56:15.671
I may never amount
to anything, Tato,

56:16.073 --> 56:18.674
but you know, it doesn't
mean I have to stoop so low

56:18.676 --> 56:21.143
that I break into some guy's
house and steal his shit.

56:21.879 --> 56:22.811
Yeah.

56:23.414 --> 56:25.581
You know what? Fuck Cowboy.

56:29.787 --> 56:34.089
You know,<i> ése,</i> my problem...
is La Ruca.

56:34.759 --> 56:35.691
What Ruca?

56:35.693 --> 56:38.761
The only woman who ever
really loved me

56:38.763 --> 56:40.963
and wanted to be the
mother of my children.

56:43.601 --> 56:47.770
-I could have had a good life.
-[melancholy music]

56:49.006 --> 56:51.073
So what happened?

56:51.075 --> 56:53.475
I was an idiot and a coward.

56:54.111 --> 56:58.814
I thought, back then so much
pussy and so little time.

57:00.818 --> 57:05.187
She just--
she just got tired of it
and married somebody else.

57:06.524 --> 57:09.925
[Irma]
Hey, Orlando, I'm so sorry.
I already called the police

57:09.927 --> 57:11.927

be here any minute.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.830

-Orlando Leal?

57:23.474 --> 57:24.673
So give her a call.

57:25.576 --> 57:27.609
No, I don't know about that.

57:28.679 --> 57:31.880
Come on. She may still want
your sexual juices.

57:32.583 --> 57:33.849
She's married.

57:37.822 --> 57:38.887
[engine rumbling]

57:41.459 --> 57:42.825
Hey, do you have any <i> varos?</i>

57:42.827 --> 57:44.026
Man, you know I don't
got no money.

57:44.028 --> 57:45.127
I'm a socialist.

57:45.129 --> 57:46.061
A socialist?

-Hey.
-A socialist, eh?

57:51.502 --> 57:55.103
-That's my hot Cheetos money.
-The truck is eating the
hot Cheetos today.

57:55.105 --> 57:56.705
May I see some identification?

57:57.007 --> 58:02.144
I just told you, Officer,
they stole my wallet,

58:03.080 --> 58:06.615
and my car keys, and my
house keys down in Sequoia.

58:06.617 --> 58:08.116
And then they came here

58:08.118 --> 58:10.486
and they robbed me
before I could get back.

58:10.988 --> 58:12.788
You know, they probably
stole my car, too.

58:12.790 --> 58:14.723
-Oh, yeah, huh?
-Yes.

58:14.725 --> 58:17.793
Here's a copy of his
rental agreement, Officer.

58:17.795 --> 58:20.662
-He's my tenant.
-Thank you.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.065
You know, just out of
curiosity, Officer,

58:23.067 --> 58:24.867
why do you think somebody
would pretend

58:25.269 --> 58:28.003
to live at a house
that's just been robbed?

58:28.739 --> 58:31.640
-Insurance.
-Okay, that's--

58:31.642 --> 58:33.609
Let me ask you something.
How did you get up here
without your car?

58:34.545 --> 58:36.578
-I hitchhiked.
-Hitchhiked.

58:37.281 --> 58:39.715
You know, I can't help you
if you're not taking
this seriously.

58:39.717 --> 58:41.583
-I am serious.
-Oh, yeah?

Yeah, the county calf

she picked me up.

-What was she doing
coming up here?
-I don't know, to buy a calf.

does it make?

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:45.887
that they stole all your shit,

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:49.124
and you'll have Karen
by your side.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.892
No.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:52.460
No.

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:56.965
No, guys like me,

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.968
we don't end up with the girl.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.270
What are you talking about?

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.972
You're a good guy.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.474
You don't even jaywalk
like I do.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.610
Just be a man.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:10.312
Be a man.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:12.147
Be a man.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.550
I'm no longer even a decent man.

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:20.922
I've broken the law just
twice this week.
No, actually once.

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.557
The other one was just
blatant pride.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.393
That bike I brought inside,

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:28.463
-'cause I stole it.
-You what?

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.066
-Yeah.
-Oh yeah?

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.636
-But, that's not nice.
-Hmm.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.404
[phone] <i> Bonjour--</i>

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:37.906
[phone beeps]

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.909
-Orlando here.
<i> -Hello, Mr. Leal,</i>

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.911
<i> Officer Buford here,</i>
<i> Highway Patrol.</i>

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.880
<i> -We found your car.</i>
-Whoa, whoa, that's great!

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.448
<i> -You need to come get it.</i>
-[piano keys banging]

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.984
Listen, just text
me the location.

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.552
I'm on it immediately.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.455
Yes, thank you, thank
you so much, thank you.

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:56.057
-Ah, they found my car.
-Oh, yeah?

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:59.194
I have four hours
until they tow it.
Shall I risk it?

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:01.663
Oh, yeah, go get your car.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.466
Be a man.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:07.502
[dramatic music]

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.284
Hey, how about that?

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.185
Her mother said she not
only remembers me,

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:25.921
but she has fond memories, too.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.926
Her daughter's husband died
a year ago of a heart attack,

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.661
so she's working in
the fields again.

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:44.940
[engine rumbling]

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:47.542
[siren blaring]

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:54.683
[Carruthers] Hey you,
stop right there.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.051
Hands where I could see them.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:58.119
Look, you don't understand.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:04.092
Officer, it's you. Yeah, you
gave me a ride yesterday.
That's my car.

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:05.727
Oh, yeah, Orlando,
like Bloom but not.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.230
The car was abandoned
on the side of the
highway today, guy.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:11.533
Yeah, by the same guys
who took my wallet

01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:14.302
and robbed my house.
They took everything I own.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.971
Tell you what, I have
the name and an address

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:17.706
of the registered
owner right here.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.040
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me yours.

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:24.546
Orlando Leal Jr. 2156
Francisquito in San Jose.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.649
Confirmed. Problem is that car
is not drivable.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:31.319
Rats chewed apart everything
under the hood, so no go.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:35.290
-Actually, it wasn't the rats,
it was the ferret.
-Whatever.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.660
Tow truck's on his way.
The good news is, well,

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.462
you don't have to worry
about paying any fines
or tow charges.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:44.532
Thank you, Officer.
You have no idea how much
you're helping me out.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:46.334
PS, protect and serve.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.303
Ah, ah, ah, not so far.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:52.040
What about this beautiful bike,
whose is that, is it yours?

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:54.242
-Not really.
-Friend's?

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:58.279
What were you going
to do with the bike
once you retrieved the car, guy?

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.715
You know, do you have
a phone charger?

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.252
Negative. Son, I like you, okay?

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.556
We're going to have to do
a little background check
on this bike, okay?

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.525
SP, standard procedure.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:12.660
HT, hang tight.

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:17.232
[melancholy music]

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:25.407
[motorcycle engine rumbling]

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:30.445
-[dramatic music]
-[horn honking]

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.415
And you're better now, yes.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:37.052
But you still shouldn't drive.
You should call a friend
to drive you back.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.353
No need to do that.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:40.188
I'll take care of him.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:41.689
I'm his friend.

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:45.427
-And you are?
-Well, they call me Cowboy,

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:48.129
and I've been looking
all over for this rascal.

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:52.567
-Do you know this cow-- person?
-Uhm.

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:55.136
Okay, he can't drive in
his condition, clearly.

01:07:55.138 --> 01:07:57.739
Of course he can't, ma'am,
that's exactly why I'm here.

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.276
What about his pickup?
If it's not removed,
it's going to be towed.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:04.245
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'd be surprised if that
old thing even runs.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:08.716
But missus, you do whatever
it is that you need to do.
Tow it if you want to.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.653
Right now I am more
concerned about my buddy here

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.555
than I am that old pickup truck.

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:17.759
Okay well, I'll take that back.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.327
You,

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.261
-you have a nice day.
-You too, ma'am.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.098
And there's no smoking
in the park.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.133
Well, of course not, Ma'am.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.770
Somebody should have told you
no smoking years ago,
you little hottie.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.206
-Okay, stop it.
-Hottie, hottie.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.774
Hottie, hottie,
with a ranger's body.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.209
-Pew, stop.
-[chuckles]

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:35.810
Alright, best buddy,

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.680
let's see if we can't get
on them old feet of yours.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:42.550
Pal of mine, oh.
Watch your steps.
Get your sea legs going.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.453
There you go. There is your
wobbly-legged little soldier.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.188
Careful, watch your
step, friend.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:50.258
Watch your step, partner,
there you go.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.161
Alright now, one simple
question, Redneck, where is it?

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.332
Huh, partner? What?

01:08:57.334 --> 01:09:00.535
That thing with the wheels
and the tires?

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.139
No, no, see, I already
stole that

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.640
and I, and, and I was
bringing it to you

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.310
and then the damned thing
just broke down.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.613
What, wait a minute.
Are you trying to tell me

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:17.417
that you stole that ice cream
truck full of goods
just to bring it back to me?

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:19.754
Now, what kind of sense
does that make?
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:22.624
Where the hell is that truck,
and where did it break down?

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:26.761
No, no, I swear, I was
bringing you back--

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:31.332
Wait a minute,
what truck, what goods?

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.568
What if she doesn't
want to talk to me?

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.640
You're not going to
get all sentimental
and shit on me, are you?

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.844
-We're the brown pride?
-I'm trying, man, I'm trying.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.846
Here, you just need to relax.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.415
We're going to do this right.

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:50.952
Maybe that's a good idea.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:53.854
Oh, yeah.

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:58.626
[dramatic music]

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.364
[comical music]

01:10:15.946 --> 01:10:18.947
[brakes squeaking]

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:26.321
No, no, we're no longer in
the gastronomy business.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:29.324
We're in the moving
of goods business.

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:30.325
It's more lucrative.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:36.598
Does a Maria work here?

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:38.850
Maria?

01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:39.934
[laughs] There are many Marias.

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:41.703
Take your pick.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:44.606
[siren blares]

01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:52.680
Halt. You're under arrest
for grand theft

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:55.283
and leaving the scene
of a crime.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:56.951
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:59.487
Anything you say or do
may be held against you.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.756
He's the one.
He stole my motorcycle.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.325
The right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.426
one will be appointed to you.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.630
No attorney, you go straight
to jail, ha!

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:11.566
If you do not keep quiet,
I'm going to read these
same rights to you too,

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:12.834
in English and Japanese.

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:14.969
-I'm Chinese.
-I don't care.

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:17.605
Now, do you understand these
rights as I have told you?

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:20.308
You stole my motorcycle.

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.611
Correction, I borrowed
his motorcycle.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:31.552
Ah-ha, calm down, okay?
Suspect is already
under custody.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.855
Now, we're going to handle
this matter in a civilized
and legal way.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.424
Now, you the owner of the
reported stolen vehicle?

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:40.595
Yes. He stole it and pushed
me to the ground.

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:44.966
-Okay, you're prepared
to press charges, sir?
-Yes, I'll press charger.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:48.603
Officer, I can produce
at least 12 witnesses

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:51.506
that will swear that he
let me borrow that bike.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.708
-Bullshit.
-Oh, you can talk to
them right now.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:55.710
You can gather all the
testimony you need.

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:58.379
Now, who are these dozens
of witnesses?

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:00.948
Well, they work for him.
They're working here right now.

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:03.785
Yeah, well, what are they?

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:05.720
What do they call them?
They are,

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:10.325
oh, farm laborers,
migrant workers, un--

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:13.328
Liar, you thief!
You stole my bike,

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:16.364
you pushed me to the ground.
No need to talk to nobody.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:20.001
Now, Mr. Huang, this is
where the crime took place
and they were witnesses?

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.969
It's my duty to gather
all the evidence.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:25.373
Why do you wanted to
bother my workers?

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.507
They're busy working.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.409
Huang, sir,

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:30.678
the way we handle disputes
like this one in this country

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.981
is through good old judicial
system, okay, the JS.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.784
You want to press
charger, charges,

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.120
it's my duty to gather
all the evidence,

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:40.855
every last juicy drop.

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:45.693
-Okay, okay,
me no press charger.
-Charges.

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:50.665
You go, take him.
Smart ass.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.800
Don't come back here ever again.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.737
[Orlando] Wait, where
are we going?

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:58.906
I'm booking you for
resisting arrest by escaping.

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:01.442
Yeah, but technically you
didn't put me under arrest.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.378
You just asked to scan
the plates on my bike.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.747
[Carruthers] I might
let you bullshit
your way out of that one,

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.515
but I'm not letting you
get out of this one.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:09.016
Within the last 18 hours,

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:11.619
I've been drugged,
tased, sprayed.

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:13.521
I even had to accept food

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:15.556
from a homeless man
who had a sign.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:17.625
Now in the next five hours,

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.461
the perfect woman for me is
going to land at the airport,

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:23.965
and if I'm not there to pick
her up, I'm going to lose her.

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:27.135
Two words, about face.

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.970

CJ.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.566
Why are you here?

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:33.668
Because...

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.807
losing you was the biggest
mistake of my life.

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:42.777
I was a fool and a coward,

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.080

How did you do that so fast?

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:40.988
My first girlfriend's
name was Karen,

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.823
and when we were about
13 years old,

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:47.361
I used to call her Nerak and
she would call me Nosredna.

-Anderson.

-No, bro, we're full. Plus,
we're transporting merchandise.

shirt. These are not
even my clothes.

You wouldn't leave another man

so bad my teeth are yellow.

"I've got to see a
man about a horse."

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:47.581
Do you really want to
do that right now?

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:52.119
-[dramatic music]
-That's what I thought.

01:24:52.121 --> 01:24:55.422
-Move it!
-[men whimpering]

01:24:57.626 --> 01:25:00.494
[birds chirping]

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:04.698
[distant car rumbling]

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.878
Hey, hitchhiking is considered

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.881
opportunistic transportation,
sir, and it is illegal.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:24.351
No, look, I just
need to get back

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.520
to Sequoia to retrieve
my pickup.

01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:28.122
Oh, your pickup is
not there anymore.

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:30.190
What? Mother piss box.

01:25:30.192 --> 01:25:33.193
Are you telling me that
somebody has stolen my pickup?

01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:36.697
No, no, it wasn't stolen,
it's been impounded.
It's at the police garage.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:41.468
That's what your, your charming
Cowboy friend told me to do.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.371
It's going to cost you about
$500 to get it back, sir.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:46.140
-He did what?
-Yeah.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.708
Well, fuck a piss shit.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.843
That black
Clint Eastwood wannabe,

01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:53.213
-he is going to pay for this.
-Hey, you watch your mouth.

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:54.748
I have a dog in the back.

01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:01.288
Why the fuck
do you have to be using

01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:03.857
all that goddamn profanity
all the time?

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:05.425
You piece of shit!

01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:11.298
[Dakota] I'm just so confused.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.901
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

01:26:13.903 --> 01:26:16.837
Yeah, God, that happens
to me all the time.

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:20.240
Alright, alright, if you
calm down, you stop cursing,

01:26:20.242 --> 01:26:21.942
I will take you where
you want to go.

01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:23.177
Come on, hop in.

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:25.579
Come on.

01:26:28.951 --> 01:26:30.217
Mind the hat.

01:26:31.954 --> 01:26:33.487
Where you going?

01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:38.859
Well, could you take me back
that way where you came from?

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.827
Yeah, sure, no problem.

01:26:41.664 --> 01:26:43.197
Alright.

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.731
Didn't you lose your dog?

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:47.401
Yeah, yeah I found him
about five miles back

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:48.902
with a German shepherd.

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.571
I think he's too young to date,

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:51.939
but you know, what can you do?

01:26:51.941 --> 01:26:53.740
Kids these days.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:56.610
-[car honking]
-Go.

01:26:56.612 --> 01:26:58.979
You have no right to get
me involved in all this.

01:26:58.981 --> 01:27:00.714
Hey, there's no all this.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.916
We're going to get paid.
What's the big deal?

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:04.551
<i> Cómo?</i> What's the big deal?

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.520
The man came at us with a gun.

01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:08.455
Oh, my God, I can't believe you.

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:12.726
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's move it. Move it, come on.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:16.363
-You disappear from my
life for 15 years.
-13.5.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:19.866
Ay, okay, 13.5. And then
you kidnap me from my job

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:22.803
to get me involved in some
sort of criminal activity?

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:25.889
-[punch thuds]
-Ow!

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:27.273
I am a decent woman, and
I have a son to raise.

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:28.842
It's not what you think.

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:30.377
Let's go, let's do this.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:35.582
What's in the truck, CJ?

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:36.883
[lighthearted music]

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:38.719
Stuff.

01:27:40.723 --> 01:27:43.023
Look, I love you and I
will always love you,

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:45.659
and I'm going to help
you raise your boy.
That's all that matters.

01:27:45.661 --> 01:27:47.828
Yeah, but how do you know
he's not going to kill us all?

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:51.398
-[whimpers] We don't.
-Fuck, Tato!

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.433
-Oh, no, fuck this shit.
-Maria?

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:56.803
-Hey, Maria.
-Tato.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:28:01.041
No, Maria's right, fuck this
shit, I'm keeping my balls.

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:04.945
Tato, Maria, come back.

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:06.680
Don't make it 13.6!

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:08.682
Maria!

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:11.585
Oh, Maria!

01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:14.554
What the f--, come on!

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:16.556
-[mariachi music]
-No!

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:18.992
How come everybody run
away from Cowboy?

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:21.561
Why does everybody run
away from Cowboy?

01:28:22.498 --> 01:28:25.065
-Ah!
-Whoa. Sir, sir, please.

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:26.833
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:29.303
Put your hands where I can
see them, both of them.

01:28:29.305 --> 01:28:32.706
-Right here, I just--
-Step away from the vehicle.

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:34.708
-Yes, just--
-Step away!

01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:35.909
Right there, stay there.

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:41.081
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:43.684
I'm not a thief,
I am not a thief.

01:28:43.686 --> 01:28:45.085
I'm just a law-abiding citizen

01:28:45.087 --> 01:28:46.720
with a master's in
French literature.

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:50.590
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought maybe
you was somebody I knew.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:55.329
-No, no, no.
-My bad then, brother.
My bad, put your hands down.

01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:57.864
We're just two brothers
standing beside the road.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:29:00.334
Ain't no sense in drawing
attention to ourselves, right?

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:02.469
-Yes.
-Alright, argh!

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:05.906
God, shit, argh, some on
my neck, some on my neck.

01:29:05.908 --> 01:29:07.674
Something on the back of
my neck. Get it, get it.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.976
-It's just a bee.
-I get it, get it, get it.

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:14.848
-Gah! Damn.
-Oh, you've never been stung?

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.018
-No, I've never been stung.
-Well, you know, some people
they have allergic reactions.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.922
I don't have reactions, okay?
I'm a reactor.

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:23.457
I don't have them.

01:29:24.126 --> 01:29:26.460
Ugh, thank you for that, man.

01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:27.994
-That's alright.
-What are you doing out here?

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:30.097
You know, in about four hours,
I'm supposed to pick up

01:29:30.099 --> 01:29:33.600
-my girlfriend from the airport
and I got robbed.
-Wow.

01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:35.769
So even if I get there, I
mean, what can I do with her?

01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:37.604
I got cleaned out.

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:39.806
-Oh, that's, that's a tragedy.
-Yeah.

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:42.476
An American, an
African-American tragedy.

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:44.678
-You know.
-Sorry, man.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.712
-It's the way the
country's going.
-Hmm.

01:29:46.815 --> 01:29:49.583
So a career with the
Forest Service

01:29:49.585 --> 01:29:52.719
will challenge you to manage
and care for over, guess,

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.156
no, don't guess,
193 million acres

01:29:56.158 --> 01:29:58.692
of our nation's most
magnificent land.

01:29:59.695 --> 01:30:02.129
Tell you what, though, man,
one brother to another,
let me help you out.

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:04.965
How would you like to make
$100 cash money right now?

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:08.435
Well, yeah, but what
do I have to do?

01:30:08.437 --> 01:30:11.805
Can you drive a truck?
-Well, I guess, yeah.

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:14.474
That's it then. I just need you
to drive that truck.

01:30:14.476 --> 01:30:19.546
I'm gonna follow you in the car.
We'll eh, a couple miles
down the road to this warehouse.

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:22.182
And when we get there, we
drop it off, you collect.

01:30:22.184 --> 01:30:24.084
Boom, bam, bip, it's all done.

01:30:24.787 --> 01:30:27.087
-But how am I going to
get to the airport?
-Well, the bip part is

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.688
you get to the airport
the best way you can.

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:30.724
I just told you, I'm
going to give you $100.

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:33.727
A hundred dollars you
can take a cab, Uber.

01:30:33.729 --> 01:30:37.431
-You can have a woman in a
motorized massage chair.
-I get it.

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:39.666
-I don't--
-I get it, okay, poor Karen.

01:30:39.668 --> 01:30:41.735
-Oh, Karen, wow.
-Yeah.

01:30:41.737 --> 01:30:43.170
-It's a beautiful name.
-Oh, she's lovely.

01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:44.538
Do you have a picture of her?

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:47.641
-In my wallet.
-Those sons of bitches.

01:30:47.643 --> 01:30:49.176
You know, no disrespect,

01:30:50.479 --> 01:30:51.978
but how do I know you're
going to pay me?

01:30:52.915 --> 01:30:55.582
-I just--
-Okay, okay, I'm dealing
with a businessman.

01:30:55.584 --> 01:30:59.586
-I get it, I get it.
You're an entrepreneur.
-This is new, this is new.

01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:04.691
Okay, okay, hold on. How about I
just front you...

01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:08.562
20 dollars,
get the rest when you get there.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:14.835
-Yeah, I, half would be better.
It's just normal.
-Okay.

01:31:14.837 --> 01:31:18.205
-Half.
-Alright, Mr. Black
businessman of America.

01:31:18.207 --> 01:31:19.506
Here's $40.

01:31:19.508 --> 01:31:22.075
-Take it or leave it.
-[Orlando mutters]

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:24.010
-Got it.
-Alright, okay.
Let's do this thing then.

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:27.747
-Stop!
-What, why?

01:31:27.749 --> 01:31:30.050
Because I said stop the car.

01:31:30.052 --> 01:31:32.152
It was really nice meeting you.

01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:37.958
-Jeez.
-Son of a bitch!

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.161
Karen, sweetie, it's Orlando.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:45.499
Listen, there's,
there's something really
important I've got to tell you.

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:51.137
Hey, hey, you can't partner up
with this piece of shit.

01:31:51.139 --> 01:31:53.273
He shits on everybody
around him.

01:31:53.275 --> 01:31:55.075
You damned double-crosser.

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:57.978
Excuse me.
Who, who are you?

01:31:58.881 --> 01:32:01.848
I'm the one who put
together this whole heist,

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:04.284
and I'm the one about
to kill a Cowboy.

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:05.819
[scoffs] Oh, yeah?

01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:09.022
Well, what you going
to do, Tom Tumbleweed?

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.658
First, I'm going to derail you,

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.527
and then I'm going to
pee on you again,

01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:16.596
and then I'm going to take
the whole thing for myself.

01:32:17.065 --> 01:32:19.966
[Cowboy coughing]

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.003
The deal is off.

01:32:23.005 --> 01:32:24.304
Just give me my $100 back.

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:27.807
What the fuck is going on?

01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:30.777
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.015
[Cowboy babbling]

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.229
Oh, wait, is that a bee buzzing

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:50.830
around your shoulder there?

01:32:51.333 --> 01:32:54.334
[Cowboy screaming]

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:59.940
Karen, it's me.
I'm so sorry about this

01:32:59.942 --> 01:33:02.842
but I have something really
important I have to tell you.

01:33:02.844 --> 01:33:04.911
And I should have told
you a long time ago, but--

01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:09.049
[suspenseful music]

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:44.217
Ah-ha, ha ha.

01:33:44.219 --> 01:33:46.353
-Ah ah ah!
-So you're the one.

01:33:47.389 --> 01:33:52.392
-You, you're the one who
stole my possessions.
-You're the butthole.

01:33:52.394 --> 01:33:55.996
Yes, I stole your wallet,
and your keys, and your car,

01:33:55.998 --> 01:34:01.067
and I even gave out your address
so they could fill that truck
with all your jerk off shit.

01:34:01.837 --> 01:34:03.770
Then you're the one who's
going to pay for this.

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:06.406
Oh, and who's going to
be the collector, you?

01:34:06.408 --> 01:34:08.842
Well, as a matter
of fact, yes, me.

01:34:08.844 --> 01:34:11.077
Oh, I am really scared.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.015
-Now, get out of my way.
I've got to--
-[urn thudding]

01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:18.685
Ow, ugh, oh.

01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:23.857
Yes, it's like Sartre
said, well, fuck Sartre.

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:26.359
"Everybody has a plan until
they get hit in the face."

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:28.995
That's Mike Tyson.

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:31.965
Fuck this shit.

01:34:36.805 --> 01:34:37.737
Thanks, pop.

01:34:37.739 --> 01:34:40.140

I think you just have
to trust your gut.

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:08.334
I think it's going to
work out just fine.

01:35:12.007 --> 01:35:14.441
-I think this is where
we say goodbye.
-Yeah.

01:35:14.443 --> 01:35:17.210
Are you sure you don't
want me to stick around
just to make sure he shows up?

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.779
No, no, no, you should
get to your hotel.

01:35:20.382 --> 01:35:21.314
Yeah.

you underestimated him.

01:35:57.419 --> 01:35:58.351
Good luck.

01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:22.292
-You came!
-Oh.

01:36:22.293 --> 01:36:23.376
I have to be honest,
I didn't think you were
going to show up.

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:27.113
No, no, no, nothing
could have kept me from
coming here tonight.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.949
What the, what's up with
the ice cream truck?

You can tell me all about it
after a nice hot bath

01:36:44.232 --> 01:36:46.866
and a glass of wine
at your place.

01:36:46.868 --> 01:36:48.234
Well, actually, we're not
going back to my place.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:53.406
I thought we'd spent your
first night in town in a hotel,
in a suite.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.544
Yeah, alright, with
room service, a bathtub,

01:37:02.117 --> 01:37:03.216

over champagne.

that come from?

-Yes?
-Yes, I even yes!

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:31.411
-Oh, my God, wait until I
tell my mother about this.
-Yeah, but where--

01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:34.848

got to move your truck.
