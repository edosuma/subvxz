00:07.775 --> 00:09.877
Now, uh, Channing,
can we take a moment

00:09.943 --> 00:11.812
to discuss the dubbing process?

00:11.879 --> 00:12.913
Yes, please. I'd love to.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.548
Uh, was it labor-intensive?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.550
It was very, very, very hard,
actually. Yeah.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.220
I think I logged in
around 107 hours in the booth.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.889
-Whoa! 107 hours.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.157

00:23.224 --> 00:24.825
you go in in the morning,
come out at night.

00:24.892 --> 00:25.993

-Neck.
-Yeah.

you didn't leave it

00:33.901 --> 00:35.869

00:35.936 --> 00:37.338

00:37.405 --> 00:39.207
I had the exact same question,
but the producers

00:39.273 --> 00:42.042
told me that people
don't want to read.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.411

to, like, break this to you,

00:58.492 --> 01:01.595

is reading those things.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.663
Huh.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.298
I had the same reaction,
to be honest.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.734
Like, I was like,
"What? No one's reading.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.869
You're-you're serious?
No one's reading."

01:08.936 --> 01:11.472

14:34.374 --> 14:35.976
(sirens wailing)

14:45.452 --> 14:47.587
JOSEPH: We need to find
somewhere to hide out.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.122
Get a change of clothes.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.524
We're out in the open here.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.198
Fuck.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.201
Why does that police force
have to be so efficient?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.704
We're the best.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.773
MAN:
Traitors! Subversives!

15:06.839 --> 15:08.841
Police, come quickly! Hurry!

15:08.908 --> 15:09.909
WOMAN:
Honey, come here.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.744
We need a plan, and fast.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.246
I got an idea. Come on.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.282
MAN:
Yes, they're down that way.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.187
They're going eastbound through
the alley; they're on foot!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.389
-We need backup.
-We got two on the run.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.007
Captain, we got them.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.209
They were spotted downtown
heading south.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.078
Get me every available unit.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.547
Don't let those traitors
get away.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.583
(dog barking in distance)

16:04.831 --> 16:07.734
(sirens wailing in distance)

16:07.800 --> 16:09.202
Gregor, you can't be serious.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.903
You got a better idea?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.806
Look, we may be desperate,
but...

16:13.873 --> 16:15.442
you trust these Americans?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.810
The same people
who faked the Moon landing?

16:17.877 --> 16:20.780
The same people who rig
the Olympics year after year?

16:20.847 --> 16:22.715
Think of who you're asking us
to work with.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.817
Look, they may have done
all those things, but right now,

16:24.884 --> 16:26.953
-it's our only move.
-(groans)

16:27.020 --> 16:29.256
Come on.
For fuck's sake, let's go.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.193
Stop! In the name of
the United States of America,

16:33.260 --> 16:34.594
I command you to stop!

16:34.661 --> 16:35.462
As God as my witness,

16:35.528 --> 16:36.963
I will shoot you commie asses

16:37.030 --> 16:39.366
up to kingdom come,
you motherfuckers.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.235
We seek asylum in the
United States of America...

16:42.302 --> 16:44.971
Down, down,
you piece of shit Romanians.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.339
We seek political asylum.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.142
All you're gonna seek is my boot
up your fucking asses!

16:49.209 --> 16:50.777
JANE:
Stop!

16:55.448 --> 16:58.451
As ambassador
to the United States of America,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.320
I grant these two men
political asylum.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.722
-Now get them inside!
-Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.023
-Go! Come on. -Go, go, go.
-Go, get inside.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.159
-Close the gate, Troy.
-Go!

17:06.226 --> 17:08.095
Close the gate, Troy.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.663
(siren wailing)

17:10.730 --> 17:12.398
(sirens stop)

17:12.464 --> 17:14.634
(grunting)

17:14.701 --> 17:16.769
(car door closes)

17:16.836 --> 17:20.473
You're harboring fugitives.
Release them to me right now.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.375
As long as they are inside
our embassy,

17:22.442 --> 17:23.476
they are on American soil.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.877
It's called international law.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.481
Since when do American's give
a shit about international law?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.417
If you have a problem with it,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.685
you can take it up at
the next United Nations meeting.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.487
Okay?

17:36.923 --> 17:38.725
What do we do now, Captain?

17:40.593 --> 17:43.830
Call the TV stations,
call the newspapers,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.998
and let's form a protest.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.667
The die is cast!

17:47.734 --> 17:51.938
(laughs) She wants to talk to me
about international law?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.541
Well, she's about to get
an international headache.

17:54.607 --> 17:58.411
When Romanians protest,
the whole world hears us!

17:59.979 --> 18:01.248
(gate bangs)

18:02.715 --> 18:04.451
(overlapping chatter)

18:15.061 --> 18:17.264
Thanks, Jane.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.166
I owe you one.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.501
(laughs softly)

18:21.568 --> 18:24.137
I knew you were
going to be trouble.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.072
Hmm.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.574
(sighs)

18:32.379 --> 18:35.482
CROWD (chanting):
Go home, USA! Go home, USA!

18:35.548 --> 18:39.719
Go home, USA!
Go home, USA!

18:39.786 --> 18:41.154
(chanting continues)

18:41.221 --> 18:43.223
Yes, we are in front of
the American embassy

18:43.290 --> 18:45.792
where two of Romania's
most wanted fugitives,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.527
Gregor Anghel and Joseph Baciu,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.230
have just been granted asylum
by the criminal government

18:50.297 --> 18:52.665
of the United States.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.067
Why the US has decided to harbor
these two dangerous,

18:55.134 --> 18:57.036
treacherous traitors,
remains unclear.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.839
But as those of us who have
been covering the United States

18:59.906 --> 19:01.208
have come to learn,

19:01.274 --> 19:03.210
understanding their cruel ways
is almost always

19:03.276 --> 19:05.678
a near impossibility.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.848
(crowd clamoring)

19:15.655 --> 19:17.424
Get back! Go!

19:22.995 --> 19:25.131
Aah! My baby! Ow!

19:25.198 --> 19:27.200
(shouting)

19:27.267 --> 19:29.969
REPORTER:
A very peaceful Romanian protest

19:30.036 --> 19:32.004
has now turned ugly and violent,

19:32.071 --> 19:35.542
due to the unchecked aggression
of the American guards.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.378
Why are you Americans
so bloodthirsty?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.247
JANE:
You try living in a world

19:40.313 --> 19:42.549
without safety nets.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.484
(laughs):
Or social justice.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.288
(phone rings)

19:48.355 --> 19:50.523
Then you can talk to me
about not caving in

19:50.590 --> 19:52.792
to man's barbaric nature.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.627
(in Southern accent):
Ambassador,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.630
the president's
on the phone for you.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.007
(phone rings)

20:08.074 --> 20:10.710
Hello, Mr. President.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.913
Yes, sir.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.486
I understand, sir.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.556
Certainly, sir.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.262
What did he say?

20:30.830 --> 20:34.233
Uh... he said...

20:34.301 --> 20:37.904
to keep up the good work.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.773
Uh...

20:42.809 --> 20:43.943
(engine revs)

21:00.827 --> 21:02.929
(clamoring)

21:07.500 --> 21:11.170
MAN:
Get out of our country!

21:11.237 --> 21:13.373
If you ask me, down with USA!

21:13.440 --> 21:15.708
Something about this whole thing
doesn't add up.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.744
I've been spying on Gregor
for years.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.579
He's a fucking asshole,
but a traitor?

21:19.646 --> 21:22.248
And Joseph strikes me
as a good communist.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.284
Don't make this more complicated
than it has to be, friend.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.587
They had their chance
for a fair trial,

21:27.654 --> 21:29.589
and they lost it
when they escaped.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.592
They're fucking guilty.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.394
I mean, Joseph's own kid
informed on him.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.295
What does that tell you?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.966
Something stinks, Stan.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.701
This just doesn't add up.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.135
Well, where the fuck
are you going?

21:43.202 --> 21:46.873
Dragos? We need to show
solidarity at the protest!

21:48.708 --> 21:50.443
(grunts)

21:52.979 --> 21:54.046

You can come out.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.430

Ma'am, there's something

It's, uh, something
you all need to see.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.007
Uh, it was just dropped off
anonymously at the front gate.

24:01.073 --> 24:05.177
(scoffs) Probably just
more hate mail for me.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.479
It's not for you, ma'am.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.515
It's for him.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.925

(screams)

24:57.864 --> 24:58.865
No!

25:03.870 --> 25:05.504
The kids were hiding
under a bed for almost a day.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.839
They were terrified.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.741
And they say
their mother was kidnapped.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.010
How can we be sure?

25:11.077 --> 25:12.679
The father's a traitor
and a liar.

25:12.745 --> 25:15.114
How do we know the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.949
They were scared shitless,
Captain.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.818
I'm beginning to think that
Gregor and Joseph are innocent.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.687
Okay, put out an APB
on Joseph's wife.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.421
Let's see if we can
track her down.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.623
And what about Gregor
and Joseph?

25:23.690 --> 25:24.957
As of right now,
they're fugitives.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.759
We bring 'em in
and we bring 'em to justice.

25:26.826 --> 25:27.927
But wait, Captain...

25:27.994 --> 25:30.096
That's all I'm gonna say on it.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.464
-But, sir...
-I said that's enough.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.100
-Drop it.
-And Gregor and Joseph?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.134
If they were framed,

25:35.201 --> 25:36.836
and Joseph's wife
has been kidnapped,

25:36.903 --> 25:39.706
it means their lives
are in danger, Captain.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.707
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:40.773 --> 25:44.076
Then they are in
the safest place possible.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.848
Hey, let it go. Huh?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.516
Fuck him.
(laughs)

25:50.583 --> 25:52.919
Come on, let's go have a drink.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.154
Come on...

25:55.221 --> 25:57.724
Hey, would you just come on.
We'll handle this.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.426
We always handle this.
Don't worry so much.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.194
(screaming on TV)

26:02.261 --> 26:03.495
(crowd shouting outside)

26:03.562 --> 26:05.732
-I have to find her.
-In case you haven't noticed,

26:05.798 --> 26:07.767
there's a mob down there
that want to drag you

26:07.834 --> 26:09.736
to the nearest prison.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.471
Well, I got to do something.
I can't just sit here.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.041
-She could be anywhere, Joseph.
-No.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.408
Not anywhere.

26:16.475 --> 26:17.777
(tape rewinding)

26:17.844 --> 26:19.879
What is it, Gregor?

26:19.946 --> 26:22.081
(muffled screaming)

26:28.320 --> 26:30.256
That's Constantine's boy.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.526
Wait. Wait.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.995
Wait, wait, wait!

26:36.062 --> 26:38.931
Joseph, think about it.
The killer is methodical.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.768
You think he'd leave
such an obvious clue?

26:41.834 --> 26:44.303
It's a trap.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.506
I don't give a shit.
My wife is in danger!

26:47.573 --> 26:48.908
Wait. Wait!

26:48.975 --> 26:52.011
Wait. How do you think
the killer knew to plant

26:52.078 --> 26:54.346
such an obvious clue
for us to figure out?

26:54.413 --> 26:57.416
What are you saying?

26:57.483 --> 26:59.518
Not only is this a trap,

26:59.585 --> 27:02.621
the killer is someone we know.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.531
Here, have a drink.
It'll mellow you out.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.901
Thanks, man.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.472
I never seen you
give a shit, Dragos.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.709
I can't believe you're
putting your neck out there

27:22.775 --> 27:24.043
for those two assholes.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.678
Ten years I've been
doing this job,

27:25.745 --> 27:28.380
and I've never
had a gut feeling.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.717
This is the first time.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.719
Man, we're old.
(chuckles)

27:32.785 --> 27:35.621
Have we really been partners
for ten years?

27:35.688 --> 27:37.089
Eight.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.792
Remember, you used to be
Nikita's partner,

27:39.859 --> 27:42.061
before he left
to work with Anghel.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.196
(laughs):
Hard to believe, right?

27:44.263 --> 27:45.597
I forgot about that.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.767
It feels like a past life.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.540
A quarter of my life
at this shit job.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.709
A shit job.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.446
Don't you wonder what else
is out there, Dragos?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.448
In the world?

28:02.514 --> 28:03.615
The world is shit.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.018
We've got it good here
in Romania.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.187
I heard about this American.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.923
He builds skyscrapers
in New York City,

28:10.990 --> 28:12.759
and he puts his name
in gold letters

28:12.825 --> 28:15.194
on every building he erects--
imagine that.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.264
-Sounds like an asshole.
-And what's wrong with that?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.665
What's wrong with
your fellow man

28:19.732 --> 28:21.100
acknowledging your greatness?

28:21.167 --> 28:23.469
Because it takes many men
to erect a building.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.536
(stomach bubbling)

28:24.603 --> 28:26.873
Not just one.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.777
Everyone contributes
to the most of their ability.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.912
But only one man gets his name
in gold letters

28:32.979 --> 28:34.480
on the front of that building,
Dragos.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.482
One man.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.352
(groaning)

28:43.555 --> 28:47.259
You shouldn't have left
the fucking protest, Dragos.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.099
(crowd shouting)

28:55.001 --> 28:57.536
MAN: That's right.
We don't need that!

28:57.603 --> 28:59.972
(shouting continues)

29:03.209 --> 29:05.411
Considering this is how the men
in your country dress,

29:05.477 --> 29:08.047
I'm surprised you have
any population growth.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.249
I think you look cute.
(giggles)

29:10.316 --> 29:13.853
I look like a man
whose dick doesn't work.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.721
Let's go, we're wasting time.

29:15.788 --> 29:16.989
JANE:
Wait.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.825
We have a tradition in the U.S.

29:18.891 --> 29:22.161
You don't leave someone without
offering them a parting gift.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.766
For once, I'm grateful
how maniacal you people are

29:27.834 --> 29:29.501
about your Second Amendment
rights.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.807
You take care of yourself,
Gregor.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.009
Our two countries may be
in a cold war,

29:37.076 --> 29:40.046
but I'm burning hot for you.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.182
Gregor!

30:07.940 --> 30:09.909
(spurs clinking)

30:12.811 --> 30:14.513
It's quiet.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.849
You're right.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.285
This is probably a trap.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.554
You don't have
to come with me.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.390
Where you go, I go.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.168
(gasping)

30:36.235 --> 30:38.237
(door creaks, echoes)

30:42.341 --> 30:44.343
Constantine.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.113
Back. In the back.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.917
(groaning)

30:51.817 --> 30:53.920
Sonya?

31:00.092 --> 31:01.493
-Dragos.
-(timer beeping)

31:01.560 --> 31:03.595
He's dead.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.935
Run!

31:11.971 --> 31:14.606
(groaning)

31:15.908 --> 31:17.443
(beeps)

31:24.183 --> 31:27.319

31:29.555 --> 31:31.657

31:36.762 --> 31:38.931
