00:01.067 --> 00:03.126
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:03.203 --> 00:06.036
The boy has no family,
he doesn't communicate,

00:06.106 --> 00:07.937
and he was found wandering alone.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.637
He has to have come from somewhere.
Someone has to be missing him.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.372
Kyle may be connected to a murder.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.744
It's possible
he witnessed the attack,

00:15.815 --> 00:17.248
or stumbled on the skeleton.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.081
- Do they have any suspects?
- No, not yet.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.349
He said the killer would probably
have scratches on him.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.321
- Hilary, get off of him.
- Ow!

00:25.392 --> 00:26.950
I told you to leave him alone.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.393
Do you really think
I'm such a super-skeeze?

00:29.462 --> 00:32.192
You two totally did it,
didn't you?

00:32.265 --> 00:35.598
Poor Declan, I never should have
told him to ask you out.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.365
- Amanda.
- There you are.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.205
- Kyle, this is Charlie. My boyfriend.
- Hey, how you doing, man?

00:46.846 --> 00:51.215
High school can be very difficult, even
for the most well-adjusted students.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.844
If this boy is special,

00:53.920 --> 00:56.616
it may not be
the easiest of transitions for him.

01:10.370 --> 01:13.237
Lori, Josh, we have to go.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.739
Hold on.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.306
Yo, Dad, keep it in your pants.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.943
- What was that for?
- Little preview.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.952
Oh, well. OK, we ready?
Where's Kyle?

01:27.954 --> 01:29.581
Here.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.180
At least someone's excited.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.283
First day of school.
Everybody should be.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.657
Yippee.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.594
This isn't Kyle's "first"
first day of school.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.636
No, that's true. He just doesn't
remember the other ones.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.672
I meant he must've gone to school
on his home planet.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.474
See you.

02:31.885 --> 02:35.912
<i>I'd gotten used to spending most
of my time at home with the Tragers.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.549
<i>But this was a whole new world.</i>

02:40.460 --> 02:41.552
Mom, no escort.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.961
What kind of mother would I be
if I let you die of embarrassment?

02:45.031 --> 02:46.999
- I'll count to ten.
- Make it 20.

02:47.066 --> 02:49.500
- Bye, Mom. See you later.
- Have a great day.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.273
- Proximity, Josh.
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

02:55.208 --> 02:57.369
I thought we went to school together.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.139
Well, they're just eager
to get to their friends.

03:02.215 --> 03:05.776
Don't worry, Kyle.
I won't leave till you're settled.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.753
<i>Everywhere I looked,
I saw people connecting.</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:20.590
<i>At first, I thought people gathered
by how they dressed.</i>

03:20.667 --> 03:23.602
<i>But bonds were acknowledged
in more subtle ways too.</i>

03:26.306 --> 03:29.605
<i>Attitude, skin color, gender.</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:36.906
<i>There didn't seem to be any one way to
figure out how these groups were formed.</i>

03:38.117 --> 03:40.085
<i>I had to wonder,</i>

03:40.153 --> 03:42.917
<i>would I find anyone
like me in this place?</i>

04:26.833 --> 04:28.664
Hilary! Wait up!

04:29.969 --> 04:31.869
- What's up, Trager?
- Hey.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.173
I got to catch her.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.970
Hills! Did you see that?

04:39.078 --> 04:42.206
Hello, awkward.
Not as awkward as the actual sex, but...

04:42.949 --> 04:45.577
Hey, check it out.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.545
News flash,

04:50.623 --> 04:53.091
that shirt doesn't go with skank.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.531
Guess we're still fighting.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.135
Yo, this is it.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.470
First period's McNally.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.174
You got Schultz?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.802
Dude, she's remedial.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.347
Go ahead, bust your ass in McNally.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.850
I'll sleep through Schultz
and still get an A.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.148
All right.
Well, we'll catch you at lunch?

05:21.220 --> 05:22.778
- Absolutely.
- All right.

05:22.889 --> 05:26.791
Hey, if you bozos need any help
reading the menu, let me know.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.533
Good morning, Mr. Hooper.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.939
Mrs. Trager.
This must be Kyle.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.978
I'm Mr. Hooper, the vice principal.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.710
Hello.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.780
These kids and their handshakes.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.823
- Can we have a moment?
- Sure. Kyle, I'll be right back.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.831
<i>I noticed that everyone knew
exactly how to respond to the sound.</i>

06:14.907 --> 06:17.933
<i>They knew just where to go
and who to be with.</i>

06:27.720 --> 06:30.587
<i>I knew if I'd ever
been at school before,</i>

06:30.656 --> 06:32.886
<i>I'd know these things too.</i>

06:46.072 --> 06:48.802
<i>But nothing felt familiar here.</i>

06:49.542 --> 06:51.703
<i>This place was different...</i>

06:52.245 --> 06:54.145
<i>...and so was I.</i>

07:29.315 --> 07:32.284
School is supposed to provide
one-on-one instruction.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.546
I thought you understood Kyle's needs.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.215
Mrs. Trager, I strive
to meet the needs of every student.

07:38.324 --> 07:42.090
And given Kyle's situation,
a personal tutor is probably best.

07:42.195 --> 07:46.723
But that is a costly arrangement,
and I have some additional concerns.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.265
He spent time in a detention center.

07:51.337 --> 07:55.671
- That was an improper placement.
- Where he engaged in an altercation.

07:55.741 --> 07:58.574
Another resident punched him.
Kyle never hit back.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.671
He is currently involved
in a homicide investigation.

08:02.748 --> 08:06.445
As a possible witness.
He still can't remember anything.

08:06.519 --> 08:11.149
And I am afraid that his memory issues
may become problematic.

08:12.391 --> 08:16.953
Mr. Hooper, Kyle is an exceptionally
bright boy who is eager to learn.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.429
I think this school
would be lucky to have him.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.168
We have five hours of testing
ahead of us. We should get started.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.298
I've already tested Kyle.
His IQ is phenomenal.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.707
Mrs. Trager, aptitude and IQ
are not the same thing.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.905
And since we do not have
any former school records for Kyle,

08:34.981 --> 08:40.078
I can't even consider a personal tutor
until we determine his grade level.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.313
What kind of tests are we talking about?

08:42.421 --> 08:44.251
Well, assuming he's around 16,

08:44.323 --> 08:47.486
I'll administer the standard
tenth grade placement exams

08:47.560 --> 08:49.926
and we shall see how he does.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.294
He's a great kid.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.424
And he's so happy to be here.

09:08.381 --> 09:12.249
I hope your instruments haven't
gathered too much dust over the summer,

09:12.318 --> 09:14.786
but my guess is,
this is the first time

09:14.854 --> 09:19.621
most of them have been
out of their cases since June.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.558
The good news is we got
some very talented musicians

09:22.628 --> 09:24.892
joining the band this year.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.796
We finally have a French horn.
We're gonna start our brass...

09:28.868 --> 09:31.428
Kyle, there you are.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.996
I have to leave now, but Mr. Hooper
is going to give you some tests.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.166
Tests?

09:36.242 --> 09:40.269
To see what you've learned and what
the school still needs to teach you.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.712
He loves math.
That's a good place to start.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.716
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

09:44.784 --> 09:48.015
OK, so you have your money for lunch
and I think you're all set.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.215
- Thanks.
- You're going to do fine.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.053
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.785
All right, Kyle, let's get started.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.302
OK!

10:14.413 --> 10:17.109
Fire up those brains
and check this out, people.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.413
Solve it by the end of the semester,

10:19.485 --> 10:22.215
you get an automatic A in my class.

10:23.055 --> 10:26.218
A professor at MIT
presented this problem.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.857
It took his students six weeks
to crack it.

10:31.063 --> 10:34.226
Sort of like a mathematical
Mount Everest if you will.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.271
Trager comma Lori.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.972
Discussing the Jacobi algorithm?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.511
Um, what?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.069
Didn't think so.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.647
Conduct your personal business
on your own time.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.481
And as for wasting mine,

10:54.587 --> 10:56.646
I'll see you after school.

11:02.061 --> 11:05.394
"It was a cold, damp morning.

11:05.464 --> 11:08.922
The mist clung to the ground
like a silver cloak. "

11:10.970 --> 11:13.302
Continue with the next paragraph...

11:14.707 --> 11:16.072
...Toby.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.272
Pass.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.178
I'm afraid I don't offer that option.

11:36.996 --> 11:40.557
"Grandfather's hat was still...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.129
...in the gravel...

11:46.272 --> 11:48.001
...path...

11:49.108 --> 11:53.568
...near the ger-geraniums. "

11:53.646 --> 11:55.477
That's enough.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.917
Toby, continue.

12:04.423 --> 12:05.754
From where we left off.

12:07.093 --> 12:10.824
"Near the geraniums
he hadn't finished planting.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.865
Rich earth was piled
next to a hole he'd prepared,

12:13.933 --> 12:16.231
like a mound of dirt
beside a fresh grave. "

12:25.144 --> 12:27.612
- This is not Math.
- We'll start with History.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.740
Ninety minutes for that portion.
I'll check on you then.

12:40.192 --> 12:44.253
<i>Page after page of names
and dates, all of them unfamiliar.</i>

12:45.364 --> 12:46.991
<i>1492.</i>

12:47.733 --> 12:48.961
<i>1812.</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:52.233
<i>George Washington.</i>

12:52.304 --> 12:53.737
<i>Marie Antoinette.</i>

12:55.941 --> 13:00.071
<i>I hadn't been taught anything yet,
but I was expected to complete a test.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:07.844
<i>I thought I was here to ask questions,
not answer them.</i>

13:11.891 --> 13:13.586
<i>That bell again.</i>

13:13.659 --> 13:15.627
<i>It rang at precise intervals,</i>

13:15.694 --> 13:18.185
<i>moving students at a regular pace.</i>

13:18.264 --> 13:21.199
<i>At least this time,
I knew what to do.</i>

13:35.581 --> 13:37.708
<i>Time to find a place again.</i>

13:56.836 --> 13:58.997
<i>In a morning filled with confusion,</i>

13:59.071 --> 14:01.767
<i>here was something
that spoke to me clearly.</i>

14:01.841 --> 14:04.867
<i>Finally, a test I could pass.</i>

15:31.196 --> 15:33.027
Someone solved it.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.794
<i>I'd learned to follow
the ebb and flow of students,</i>

16:03.862 --> 16:07.161
<i>but this time, instead of scattering
in every direction,</i>

16:07.232 --> 16:09.132
<i>they all moved to the same place.</i>

16:10.235 --> 16:12.533
<i>- Hi.
- It seemed everyone was welcome here.</i>

16:14.206 --> 16:16.970
<i>And I thought
I might find a place to belong.</i>

16:32.491 --> 16:34.356
Oh, I wouldn't sit there.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.325
Unless you want to be known
as "Geek-man's" friend.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.764
It's what everyone calls me
because my last name's Deichman.

16:43.235 --> 16:46.204
People might also think
you're "Dyke-man's" friend,

16:46.271 --> 16:48.171
which would make you a lesbian.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.204
Whatever, do what you want.

16:56.382 --> 17:00.148
- I can't see?
- This is a joke. Right?

17:00.252 --> 17:02.482
Someone told you to sit here.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.317
Very funny.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.881
- No. I draw too.
- Shut up.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.223
- You do?
- See where Kyle's sitting?

17:16.300 --> 17:20.031
- If you need five bucks for lunch...
- He's sitting with L.K. Deichman.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.665
- And?
- That's social suicide.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.742
You're supposed to look out for him.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.268
So are you. Let him sit
with your punk-ass little posse.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.512
So Lori got like ten shades of pissy
and called me a slut,

17:35.587 --> 17:38.647
after her freakazoid foster brother
was groping me.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.952
Like I'd ever go there.

17:40.025 --> 17:43.984
You've been salivating over him
since he messed with that cop.

17:44.096 --> 17:47.554
Well, not anymore. Look at him.
He's friends with Geek-man.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.396
Want to hear something funny?

17:52.471 --> 17:55.235
Nadine Velasquez last period?
Same shirt.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.577
Laugh riot.
You call her a slut too?

17:59.645 --> 18:03.103
Come on, Hills. Truce?
I'm so over fighting.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.649
For reals?

18:04.716 --> 18:07.014
Because I'm so over you.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.415
Girls, coming?

18:11.623 --> 18:15.115
- You guys, come on.
- You should've taken off the shirt.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.739
He doesn't look like an alien.

18:37.816 --> 18:41.183
I'm telling you,
the stuff I've seen him do.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.254
- I've got a whole file.
- Right.

18:43.322 --> 18:46.655
So instead of taking over the world,
he's here in high school.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.420
It's part of his master plan.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.793
To recruit an army of losers
like L.K. Deichman.

18:51.864 --> 18:55.322
Speaking of losers,
how was Schultz this morning?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.890
I'm the king of that class.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.598
- Bunch of morons who can't read.
- Man, that's pathetic.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.173
That's the thing about comics.

19:09.248 --> 19:12.342
The mainstream stuff,
it's pretty cheesy.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.442
"Anime. "

19:16.188 --> 19:18.656
It's just a fancy word for cartoons.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.988
I like the indie press stuff.

19:21.059 --> 19:25.928
Comics like Diesel Dan,
Tarsus, Vera Zero.

19:27.866 --> 19:32.132
- Why do they have secret identities?
- To hide their amazing abilities.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.271
So they can help people
without freaking them out.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.138
This is basic stuff.
How can you not know this?

19:40.212 --> 19:43.045
I don't know.
But what about George Washington?

19:43.115 --> 19:47.848
- Mmm. Yeah. How about him?
- Is he a superhero too?

19:49.454 --> 19:51.922
He's the first president ever
of America.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.618
And Hathor, is she on another test?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.321
Superheroes aren't real.
What's wrong with you?

19:57.396 --> 19:59.887
Seriously,
I know it's your first day and all.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.363
- Don't you know anything?
- That's why I came here.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.897
To learn.

20:05.971 --> 20:09.134
You came to high school.
To learn.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.435
That's a good one.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.546
OK, look, maybe I can help you.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.796
- You get the sushi?
- Got the sushi.

20:36.902 --> 20:41.168
- I can't believe we have an hour alone.
- Oh, an hour is barely enough time.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.869
<i>- Yeah, we'll make the most of it.
- Are you close?</i>

20:44.943 --> 20:47.844
- I'm around the corner, baby.
- I'll be waiting.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.281
<i>Nicole?</i>

20:53.352 --> 20:55.877
Uh, hang on. I just heard something.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.445
Hello?

20:59.458 --> 21:01.619
Stephen, I think someone's breaking in.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.218
Get out! Now! Just go!

21:43.602 --> 21:46.571
I'll try to make this as quick
and painless as possible.

21:46.672 --> 21:49.038
My husband
is really worried about me.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.470
- Nicole.
- Stephen, I was just going to call you.

21:53.545 --> 21:56.105
- This is Tom from our security company.
- Hello.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.375
- What's going on?
- Well, I was on patrol

21:58.450 --> 22:00.509
and saw someone
break in your window.

22:00.585 --> 22:01.950
Tom scared him off.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.319
- Does, um, that belong to anyone?
- No.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.151
I'm sure he dropped it.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.625
Probably used the handle
to break the glass.

22:09.695 --> 22:12.596
- Any idea who it might be?
- No, I didn't get a good look,

22:12.664 --> 22:14.962
but there's been break-ins lately.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.764
I've called in the incident.
I'll make sure the police are aware.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.805
- You OK?
- I am now.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.840
I'm sorry I scared you.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.035
- As long as you're OK.
- Yeah.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.411
- You just happened to be driving by?
- Yeah. Lucky thing.

22:30.482 --> 22:34.543
Now if I can just finish up this report,
I'll get out of your way. OK?

22:34.619 --> 22:37.452
- Sure.
- This room is what?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.490
Oh, um, it's a guestroom.

22:39.558 --> 22:40.718
Oh.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.056
Pardon me, but our records indicate

22:43.128 --> 22:46.029
that, uh, all your bedrooms
are upstairs. No?

22:46.098 --> 22:49.067
Well, we have a temporary
foster care situation.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.101
Oh, I see. I see.

22:51.169 --> 22:54.332
Well, that's nice of you folks
to take someone in.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.304
How's that working out?

22:57.676 --> 22:58.836
Fine.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.639
What happens if he comes back?

23:00.712 --> 23:03.545
I'll drive by more often
and keep an eye on the house.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.243
- Well, we'd appreciate that.
- It's my job.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.885
- Thank you.
- Bye.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.655
Gosh! Sorry.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.065
- Sure you are.
- I hope I didn't ruin it.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.981
Anything you wanna know,
this is the place to find it.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.745
Like the Fortress of Solitude.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.185
More like a good place to nap.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.856
Might as well start with this.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.993
It's like... everything.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.256
Boiled down.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.264
- Thank you.
- No problem.

24:04.342 --> 24:05.832
OK.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.639
Look, I guess I'll...
I'll see you around.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.777
- Kyle?
- Amanda.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.214
How's it going?

25:20.151 --> 25:23.416
- Oh! You remember Charlie.
- Yeah, we met at Preston's party.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.558
Yes. I remember.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.822
A little, uh, light reading?

25:36.001 --> 25:38.162
Listen, uh, I know it's your first day

25:38.270 --> 25:41.171
and I remember when I moved,
it took getting used to.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.673
So if you need anything,
just give me a shout.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.470
Well... OK.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.450
Bye, Kyle.
We'll see you later.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.518
Big talker.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.889
He can be shy, but he's really sweet.

26:03.228 --> 26:07.494
I could be wrong,
but I think he's got a problem with me.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.127
Hey. Who could ever
have a problem with you?

26:26.751 --> 26:29.720
I'm telling you, she was triple-X hot.
Totally into me.

26:29.788 --> 26:33.019
You're such a liar. As if you were
anywhere near that hot tub.

26:33.091 --> 26:36.618
All true, man.
Our stock is going way up this year.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.067
- Dude, what was that about?
- I don't know.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.227
I think I insulted him.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.362
Well, un-insult him.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.205
That's Toby Neuwirth.
He's got major anger management issues.

26:51.309 --> 26:53.834
No kidding.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.649
- Still on hold?
- Yeah.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.812
Probably nothing, but I haven't
seen him on patrol before

27:02.887 --> 27:04.445
and he shows up just in time?

27:04.522 --> 27:06.581
Have you heard of any break-ins?

27:06.658 --> 27:08.285
<i>- No.
- Mr. Trager?</i>

27:08.360 --> 27:10.055
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.</i>

27:10.128 --> 27:13.962
Yes, Tom is a new employee here.
Tom Foss. He just started this week.

27:14.032 --> 27:18.059
It's just that we didn't know him.
I assume you do background checks?

27:18.136 --> 27:20.604
Absolutely. In fact,

27:20.672 --> 27:23.436
Tom has a very impressive
military background.

27:23.541 --> 27:26.203
Decorated veteran.
Several years in security.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.336
<i>So nothing to worry about.</i>

27:29.347 --> 27:31.781
<i>- Sounds good. Thank you.
- No problem.</i>

27:33.952 --> 27:35.249
He checked out fine.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.990
These suburban types,
I'm telling you.

27:41.693 --> 27:45.652
Must be something about
paying a mortgage makes them all jumpy.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.699
Meanwhile they got a guy like you
looking out for them.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.133
Shoot.
They couldn't be in better hands.

28:04.582 --> 28:06.311
<i>Twenty-two volumes.</i>

28:06.384 --> 28:08.750
<i>Over 17 thousand articles.</i>

28:08.820 --> 28:13.382
<i>In one afternoon, I'd covered the span
of human history and circled the globe.</i>

28:23.134 --> 28:26.194
I thought you'd still be here.

28:28.873 --> 28:33.435
Kyle, Charlie's a really great guy.

28:34.779 --> 28:37.077
I think you'd really like him.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.476
Because I think you're a great guy too.

28:43.988 --> 28:47.014
But you know...

28:47.726 --> 28:51.093
You know there's nothing between...

28:52.430 --> 28:57.265
I mean, he thought there might be
but I just...

28:57.335 --> 28:59.303
I wanted to make sure that...

29:01.573 --> 29:04.406
You don't like me, do you?

29:05.844 --> 29:10.975
<i>I just learned of every
human tragedy, war and disaster.</i>

29:12.484 --> 29:15.419
<i>But Amanda presented
the most difficult lesson.</i>

29:19.157 --> 29:21.717
<i>I could tell which answer
would relieve her.</i>

29:21.826 --> 29:23.953
<i>And which she didn't want to hear.</i>

29:25.897 --> 29:27.455
Kyle?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.893
You're my friend.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.434
Yeah.

29:37.575 --> 29:39.133
We're friends.

29:39.844 --> 29:43.678
<i>Telling Amanda my true feelings
might have brought us closer.</i>

29:43.748 --> 29:46.216
<i>But she belonged with Charlie.</i>

29:46.284 --> 29:50.050
<i>Which meant
I still belonged... nowhere.</i>

29:50.155 --> 29:51.816
Kyle, wait.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.856
You don't have to learn
everything in one day.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.894
School's over for today.

29:59.898 --> 30:02.799
Two more seconds.

30:02.867 --> 30:06.394
Now it's over.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.478
Well, so much for
our afternoon rendezvous.

30:20.552 --> 30:24.488
- So, you'll call the insurance company?
- Yeah, the glass company, too.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.853
No, hold on.

30:25.924 --> 30:29.291
No, I can hang a window
over the weekend.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.884
Oh.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.464
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.123
You're welcome.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.898
Don't get that.

30:52.617 --> 30:53.777
Hello?

30:54.752 --> 30:56.242
Yes.

30:57.755 --> 31:00.053
I'm sorry, what?

31:02.393 --> 31:04.520
Oh. I'll be right there.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.754
That was the school.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.132
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

31:10.134 --> 31:13.001
- Which kid?
- Kyle.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.874
Yeah, it's going to be a great game.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.574
- Hey, I'll check you guys later.
- Peace.

31:24.649 --> 31:27.584
- What's up with you today?
- I'm late for detention.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.916
If you wanna talk about
what happened...

31:29.988 --> 31:31.853
- What happened?
- Yeah, you know.

31:31.923 --> 31:33.857
You want to talk now?

31:33.925 --> 31:37.088
- I figured that you could...
- It wasn't some game, Declan.

31:37.161 --> 31:39.686
"You catch that sex
we had last weekend?"

31:39.764 --> 31:41.789
"Yeah, that was awesome, nice offense. "

31:41.866 --> 31:44.528
I don't know Hilary
told you to ask me to the party.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.900
Like you guys
didn't yuk it up at lunch.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.838
You got it all wrong.
I was just checking up on you.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.741
If you wanted to check up on me,
you would have called.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.937
You didn't, which is fine.
It's honest.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.880
But this sudden interest
in my feelings or whatever,

31:57.949 --> 31:59.507
it's fake and unnecessary.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.984
The sex was awful,
you could give a crap about my feelings,

32:03.087 --> 32:06.750
and you are the absolute last person
that I want to talk to right now.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.725
I was asking about what happened today.

32:09.794 --> 32:10.954
With Hilary.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.109
Hey.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.481
Hey, man.

32:36.554 --> 32:39.580
- You're in Schultz with me, right?
- Little wiseass.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.385
I don't know why you've got a problem.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.395
I don't. You got a problem.

32:46.497 --> 32:50.194
You're right. I do.
And I'll go take care of that.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.230
You think you're smart, huh?

32:55.039 --> 32:56.973
Dude, I'm in remedial.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.599
With a bunch of morons then?

32:58.710 --> 32:59.870
Stop.

33:01.079 --> 33:04.048
- Why'd you hit him?
- Who's this? Your boyfriend?

33:08.086 --> 33:09.849
Let's go.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.554
You know, you really are an idiot.

33:34.545 --> 33:36.706
Whoa!

33:39.784 --> 33:41.752
What's happening here?

33:58.569 --> 34:01.470
The other student insists
Kyle threw the first punch.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.269
- I didn't hit anyone.
- That is not how it appeared.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.277
Mr. Hooper, all we saw
was Kyle holding that boy.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.404
He was stopping him,
not pushing him.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.641
Are you looking to discredit him?

34:11.748 --> 34:14.616
Mrs. Trager, that altercation,

34:14.685 --> 34:18.451
plus Kyle's complete disregard
for school rules, his wandering,

34:18.523 --> 34:20.547
the tests he simply ignored.

34:20.625 --> 34:24.686
I'm sorry, but there's just no place
for a boy like Kyle in this school.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.699
Trager comma Lori.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.831
Have a seat.

34:34.972 --> 34:38.931
One plus two minus one
until you reach 500.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.639
Legibly.

34:46.650 --> 34:50.109
- How is this possible?
- Someone answered it?

34:50.188 --> 34:51.416
Yeah.

34:52.356 --> 34:55.223
You know I put it up every year
just to motivate you kids.

34:55.293 --> 34:58.057
Hardly anyone attempts it,
let alone answers it.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.222
Well, congratulations.

35:00.298 --> 35:04.064
Someone must know a mathematician.
Or have searched the Internet.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.104
No student here could possibly
solve this on his own.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.968
Mr. Miller, if I could point you
in the right direction,

35:12.543 --> 35:14.704
can we forget about detention?

35:18.449 --> 35:21.350
He's entitled to a one-on-one tutor.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.979
Not after today's performance.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.148
- That's him.
- I'm in a conference.

35:26.224 --> 35:28.988
Excuse me, this is important.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.720
- Did you solve my math problem?
- Kyle?

35:34.532 --> 35:37.660
- Yes, I did.
- OK. How'd you do it?

35:37.735 --> 35:39.225
The Fourier series?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.861
You used Bessel functions?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.234
Kronecker delta?

35:42.306 --> 35:45.764
- I just looked at it and I knew.
- Please, tell me what's going on.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.368
Um...

35:48.446 --> 35:51.540
This student just solved
a grad school level math problem

35:51.616 --> 35:53.311
and he can't tell me how.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.944
This young man
is not a student at this school.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.784
Well, he has to be.
I have to work with him.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.793
- He didn't answer a single question.
- Kyle, why didn't you?

36:03.861 --> 36:06.762
- I didn't know the answers.
- You see?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.129
But I do now.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.690
Let him take the test.

36:11.235 --> 36:15.672
Testing must be completed in a five-hour
period for the scores to be valid.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.105
There's 30 minutes left.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.234
Just give him the test.

36:49.407 --> 36:52.774
So how'd your day go?

36:53.444 --> 36:55.776
- Awesome.
- I want to transfer.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.877
Hey, what happened?

37:00.384 --> 37:02.249
I'll be outside.

37:04.255 --> 37:05.916
Yeah, practice was crazy.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.959
Coach is going nuts.
He was all over me though.

37:09.026 --> 37:11.085
- I'll see you guys later.
- Peace, man.

37:18.869 --> 37:22.361
Look, I know I was super harsh before.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.204
- I thought...
- I know what you thought.

37:25.309 --> 37:29.006
Look, this whole day sucked,
so it wasn't about you, OK?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.048
It was a little about me.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.949
Yeah. Well, it was mostly bad timing.

37:39.924 --> 37:44.156
Declan, we're going for coffee.
Come with?

37:46.597 --> 37:48.326
No, I'm good.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.862
You didn't have to do that.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.668
Wanted to.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.674
- I should apologize.
- Yes, you should.

38:04.282 --> 38:08.184
But you don't have to.
Look, I screw up all the time.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.716
Maybe it's your turn.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.590
Sounds fair.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.128
You OK?

38:21.198 --> 38:22.631
I'll live.

38:28.739 --> 38:32.470
Hey, Trager? Define "awful".

38:34.178 --> 38:36.339
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.553
Done.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.855
Done? With which section?

38:50.761 --> 38:52.922
All of them.

38:53.030 --> 38:56.522
- That's not possible.
- Totally is.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.467
- Good going, Kyle.
- Now hold on here.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.095
I still have to grade them.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.936
I think that's just a formality,
Mr. Hooper.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.340
So when can he start with his tutor?

39:07.111 --> 39:10.046
Well, if... if his scores measure up,

39:11.349 --> 39:13.249
first thing tomorrow morning.

39:13.317 --> 39:14.750
Nice job, Kyle.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.309
I'll see you soon.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.813
I don't want a tutor.

39:21.492 --> 39:24.325
Well, but Kyle, I thought
you wanted to go to school.

39:24.929 --> 39:28.057
I do. But not like that.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.597
Now explain this to me.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.239
That whole private tutor
was such a sweet deal,

39:36.307 --> 39:39.572
but you want to go to class
with the rest of us?

39:39.643 --> 39:42.908
- If I don't, I'll be alone.
- You'll be lucky.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.005
No vicious backstabbers
to deal with.

39:45.082 --> 39:46.982
And those are her friends.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.818
It's not like you need to go to school.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.986
- You already know everything.
- Facts, maybe some dates.

39:57.695 --> 40:01.859
If I'm stuck with a tutor I'll never
learn what I really need to know.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.098
Why do people do what they do?

40:18.015 --> 40:19.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:25.122 --> 40:28.285
- Thanks for helping me today.
- No worries.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.425
- That's him.
- The kid that took on Toby.

40:31.495 --> 40:33.395
People are looking.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.198
- So?
- It's weird.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.972
I think weird is good.

40:47.344 --> 40:49.244
I saw what you did.

40:50.314 --> 40:53.078
Ka-blow! Swoosh!

40:53.851 --> 40:55.182
Bam!

40:57.421 --> 40:59.981
- You know, vanquished.
- "Ka-blow"?

41:01.525 --> 41:05.291
I know I said superheroes
aren't real, but...

41:08.532 --> 41:10.295
Keep it.

41:39.563 --> 41:42.930
<i>I still don't know if I'd ever
been to school before that day.</i>

41:43.367 --> 41:45.528
<i>And I wish I could've learned something,</i>

41:45.636 --> 41:48.400
<i>anything, that would've
helped me remember my past.</i>

42:01.719 --> 42:06.088
<i>Still, every day I spent here
became a part of my own history.</i>

42:06.156 --> 42:08.681
<i>And if I wanted to learn people,</i>

42:08.759 --> 42:11.990
<i>I knew that part of that meant learning
from my own choices.</i>

42:12.696 --> 42:16.359
<i>And making new choices tomorrow.</i>

42:23.741 --> 42:26.471
He said he read
the entire encyclopedia.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.308
He probably flipped through
and jogged his memory.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.940
And then got a perfect score?

42:33.350 --> 42:35.818
How could he know that much?

42:36.305 --> 42:42.437
