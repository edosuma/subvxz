00:26.100 --> 00:40.733
*

00:43.700 --> 00:46.233
(Birds chirping)

00:48.233 --> 00:59.133
*

01:17.200 --> 01:19.433
(Playful classical music)

01:25.767 --> 01:27.133
(Gasping)

01:27.167 --> 01:28.600
You hold your ground, Sir.

01:28.633 --> 01:30.267
Have you no shame, Madam?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.133
Debauching yourself
in your father's house?

01:32.167 --> 01:33.667
And with a common teacher?

01:33.700 --> 01:35.067
I am of the king's court.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.067
Ha!

01:36.100 --> 01:37.700
And I'm not just a teacher.

01:37.733 --> 01:40.300
I'm a Bachelor of Geography
and Cartography.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.700
Don't bandy words
with me, Sir.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.033
You're a charlatan!

01:43.067 --> 01:44.700
Like that rogue Newton,

01:44.733 --> 01:46.200
Who swindled half of Europe

01:46.233 --> 01:48.200
When an apple
fell on his head.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.100
GIRL:
Father, I love him.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.667
Love him? Him?

01:51.700 --> 01:53.433
He can't even afford
a decent pair of britches.

01:53.467 --> 01:56.333
I've great plans that'll
bring me fame and fortune.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.133
Yes I'm sure,
by marrying my daughter.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.333
No. What I mean is--

01:59.367 --> 02:00.600
What do you mean,
"no"?

02:00.633 --> 02:02.100
Of course I intend
to marry you,

02:02.133 --> 02:03.600
Just not now. More--

02:03.633 --> 02:04.800
In the future.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.467
Ha ha!

02:06.500 --> 02:08.366
If I have my way,
he doesn't have a future.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.567
Get him out of here.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.233
Well go on!

02:12.333 --> 02:14.567
Jonathan, run!

02:14.600 --> 02:16.100
(Lively classical music playing)

02:16.133 --> 02:19.267
Shoot him in the back!

02:19.300 --> 02:20.567
Run Jonathan, run!

02:20.600 --> 02:22.333
If your mother was alive,

02:22.367 --> 02:23.733
She'd be appalled.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.733
(Men shouting)

02:27.367 --> 02:29.133
Set the dogs on him!

02:29.167 --> 02:30.500
Run, darling!

02:30.533 --> 02:31.800
I love you!

02:31.833 --> 02:33.233
I love you too, darling!

02:33.267 --> 02:35.000
Believe in me!

02:37.167 --> 02:44.100
*

02:44.133 --> 02:45.300
Why thank you.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.667
Don't forget your birds.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.100
(Horses whinnying)

02:52.133 --> 02:58.067
*

02:59.367 --> 03:00.667
JONATHAN:
 My dear Miss Dadli,

03:00.700 --> 03:02.500
I offer you 
 my deepest apologies

03:02.533 --> 03:04.067
For my hurried departure.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.667
As bitter as it is 
 to admit to you,

03:05.700 --> 03:09.133
I have to say that 
 your father was right.

03:09.167 --> 03:11.667
It is true that I have spent 
 all of my money,

03:11.700 --> 03:13.433
But let me tell you, 
 I have not wasted it

03:13.467 --> 03:15.033
As he wants to imagine,

03:15.067 --> 03:17.267
But invested it 
 in my invention.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.533
With the help 
 of this unique device,

03:21.567 --> 03:24.767
I'm determined to revolutionize 
 the field of cartography

03:24.800 --> 03:27.333
With maps that finally show 
 the true borders

03:27.367 --> 03:30.567
Of the countries of the world.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.300
I have decided to commence 
 this grand project

03:33.333 --> 03:35.033
Right from the heart 
 of our beloved Greenwich,

03:35.067 --> 03:36.533
Which I have chosen to be

03:36.567 --> 03:38.667
The starting point 
 for all my calculations.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.100
Some day, 
 our quiet little town

03:43.133 --> 03:45.800
Will be renowned the world over 
 as the place

03:45.833 --> 03:47.533
All time is measured against.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.267
This is the dream,

03:49.300 --> 03:51.200
But I need you 
 to believe in me.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.767
My dear, the impressions of my 
 journey I write in my letters.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.067
In order for them not to be 
 read by unintended persons,

04:01.100 --> 04:02.767
I encrypt the letters 
 using a mirror,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.100
As Leonardo Da Vinci 
 did before me.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.100
I love you,

04:07.133 --> 04:10.433
And refuse to be thought of 
 as some dowry hunter.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.467
I will show everyone 
 that that is not true.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.166
My news will fly to you 
 by means of carrier pigeon.

04:19.233 --> 04:23.433
In this way, when times of 
 great difficulty confront me,

04:23.467 --> 04:24.733
I will feel you close to me

04:24.767 --> 04:27.033
And my heart will be warmed.

04:39.133 --> 04:41.467
MAN, NARRATING:
 Lower your eyes.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.767
Kneel down and pray.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.133
Be afraid of the eyes of Viy,

04:47.167 --> 04:48.633
The ancient god who dwells

04:48.667 --> 04:52.633
In the eternal darkness 
 of the cave.

04:52.667 --> 04:57.133
His eyes have taken root 
 in the Earth.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.200
If a man but glances at him,

05:00.233 --> 05:03.433
Then that man dies.

05:03.467 --> 05:07.800
And no prayer can conquer 
 that mysterious fear.

05:07.833 --> 05:11.033
The old folks say so, 
 and their grandparents said so.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.167
On summer nights,

05:17.200 --> 05:19.200
Young girls looking 
 for true love

05:19.233 --> 05:22.167
Float burning candles 
 on wreaths in the water.

05:25.167 --> 05:28.233
And if some young man 
 gathers in your wreath,

05:28.267 --> 05:31.367
You know that he 
 is your destiny.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.467
Since the beginning of time

05:35.500 --> 05:37.667
When the Earth was young 
 and the gods were young,

05:37.700 --> 05:41.000
This tradition has lived in the 
 hearts of the Slavic people.

05:43.733 --> 05:46.600
Burning candles float 
 in the darkness.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.400
It has always been so.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.367
(Thunder rumbling)

05:51.400 --> 05:54.800
(Birds shrieking)

05:54.833 --> 05:56.800
Pannochka?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.200
Where are you?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.567
(Thunder rumbling)

06:02.233 --> 06:03.367
(Thunder crashing)

06:05.467 --> 06:07.767
Pannochka!

06:07.800 --> 06:11.067
(Marsh birds chirping)

06:11.100 --> 06:13.433
Time to go, Pannochka!

06:13.467 --> 06:14.733
(Thunder crashing)

06:14.767 --> 06:16.333
(Gasping)

06:16.367 --> 06:17.467
(Shrieking)

06:17.500 --> 06:18.767
(Screaming)

06:23.367 --> 06:26.267
(Thunder crashing)

06:35.600 --> 06:50.033
*

06:50.067 --> 06:52.633
(Growling)

07:07.133 --> 07:08.500
Pannochka!
Pannochka!

07:08.533 --> 07:09.667
MAN:
Pannochka!

07:11.500 --> 07:12.467
MAN:
Right here!

07:12.500 --> 07:13.633
Got her.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.100
Who did this?

07:19.467 --> 07:22.500
Who did this to you?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.167
She wants to confess.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.300
You must pray over me.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.433
God help us.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.333
Protect us from evil.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.733
There's a student priest
from the seminary.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.600
Khoma Brutus.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.767
He'll pray by me for three
nights, truly and sincerely.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.433
He knows who wears the sheep's.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.067
MAN:
I think she's dead.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.267
(People murmuring)

07:44.300 --> 07:45.433
Look!

07:45.467 --> 07:47.367
The wages of sin!

07:47.400 --> 07:50.500
One dead and one
out of her mind!

07:54.600 --> 07:57.600
(Bell tolling)

08:01.500 --> 08:03.233
(Ominous chanting)

08:08.567 --> 08:12.367
So complete your three nights
of prayer over my daughter,

08:12.400 --> 08:13.667
Exactly as she requested,

08:13.700 --> 08:15.133
And I will reward you.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.267
Who, me?

08:16.300 --> 08:18.133
Yes, you.

08:18.167 --> 08:21.433
It was my daughter's dying wish
and you must fulfill it.

08:21.467 --> 08:24.700
Have you ever felt the whip
crack on your skin?

08:24.733 --> 08:27.433
No, and it is not something
I want to happen to me.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.200
Then do not fail me.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.467
I'll pay you
a thousand gold coins

08:31.500 --> 08:33.167
If you succeed in this.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.633
(Whispering)
A thousand gold coins.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.433
You will not be allowed
to fail me.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.567
Master Sotnik--
Lock the door.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.633
He stays here
for three nights.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.600
(Door closing heavily)

08:47.200 --> 08:49.400
Please, dear God,
hear your humble servant

08:49.433 --> 08:53.300
And forgive his sins
through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.067
Amen.

08:57.100 --> 09:01.300
* Oh Lord,
our Father dear God *

09:01.333 --> 09:05.400
* Embrace us all
in your faith *

09:05.433 --> 09:07.600
* And the whole--

09:11.533 --> 09:14.700
(Ominous music playing)

09:14.733 --> 09:23.433
*

09:23.467 --> 09:24.500
Chalk circle,

09:24.533 --> 09:26.700
Save me, protect me.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.433
Chalk circle,
save me, protect me!

09:36.500 --> 09:38.233
Save me, protect me.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.333
(Shrieking)

09:42.400 --> 09:44.533
Here is a thousand gold coins.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.800
Blessings for you.

09:49.833 --> 09:53.367
We could-- we could build
a monastery with this.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.333
No. That's Khoma's fee.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.533
Now leave and prepare everything
for my daughter's funeral.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.067
Let's get it done, soon.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.333
What?

10:12.367 --> 10:14.133
You know.
Pannochka's burial.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.633
For three nights I've had
the shit scared out of me.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.467
Master's daughter, yes,
but still a witch.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.200
(Twigs cracking)

10:23.267 --> 10:25.100
Oh, it's Paisiy.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.300
What do you got there?

10:30.333 --> 10:31.500
It's from Sotnik.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.367
It's the fee
he gave to Khoma.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.367
I have never seen
so much money before

10:35.400 --> 10:37.033
In my whole life!

10:38.767 --> 10:41.267
The key.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.167
Go on!
Shh!

10:54.200 --> 10:56.733
(Wood creaking)

11:12.167 --> 11:13.300
(Squawking)

11:13.333 --> 11:15.333
PRIEST:
There is a curse here!

11:15.367 --> 11:18.167
Be gone, Satan!

11:18.200 --> 11:20.100
This is a cursed place.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.600
His soul has departed.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.600
This holy place
has been violated.

11:24.633 --> 11:27.733
This can no longer be called
a place of worship.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.300
Board up the doors
and the windows!

11:29.333 --> 11:30.600
So she got him
in the end.
Yeah, the witch.

11:30.633 --> 11:31.800
There's witchcraft here.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.067
PAISIY:
I declare this!

11:34.100 --> 11:35.567
If that's so,

11:35.600 --> 11:38.500
Yesterday's rules
are dead and gone.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.600
Divide it equally,
like two blood brothers.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.567
(Door closing)

11:52.667 --> 11:54.800
There's a hole in the roof.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.367
(Hammering)

11:59.200 --> 12:02.200
(Grunting)

12:02.233 --> 12:05.100
(Squawking)

12:05.133 --> 12:06.300
Ahhh!

12:06.333 --> 12:08.700
This holy place
has now been cursed!

12:08.733 --> 12:11.533
From top to bottom!

12:11.567 --> 12:13.333
See what the witch
has done to me?

12:13.367 --> 12:15.133
Khoma is lying lifeless
in the chalk circle.

12:15.167 --> 12:18.800
We can never go back in there
again, Master Sotnik.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.433
The curse up there
must be a devil of sorts!

12:21.467 --> 12:22.800
This is a cursed place.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.767
We must barricade--

12:24.800 --> 12:28.167
We can't leave
my daughter.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.500
(Birds shrieking)

12:31.533 --> 12:33.733
Look...

12:33.767 --> 12:37.533
(People shouting in fear)

12:37.567 --> 12:38.667
Don't take the sin
upon your soul.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.233
Don't go in.

12:40.267 --> 12:43.033
Think Sotnik,
your people, they need you!

12:43.067 --> 12:44.633
They need you!

12:44.667 --> 12:46.700
Please don't make this
any worse than it is.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.533
In the name of the Father.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.633
(People screaming in background)

13:03.067 --> 13:05.300
(Wind whooshing)

13:09.767 --> 13:12.400
JONATHAN:
 My travels have continued 
 for a whole year.

13:12.433 --> 13:17.300
Today is the first day 
 of April.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.300
(Horses whinnying)

13:19.333 --> 13:21.433
The spring takes so long 
 to come here.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.467
What awaits me further East?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.633
Thank you, Nanny.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.633
Really, my Lord!

13:30.667 --> 13:32.767
Witch.

13:34.633 --> 13:37.433
Carrier pigeons now, is it?

13:37.467 --> 13:38.733
Papa, please look at me.

13:41.733 --> 13:45.200
Oh, God.

13:47.733 --> 13:50.300
I'll kill him.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.633
JONATHAN:
 Luck accompanied me 
 but now it has turned away.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.567
I have not eaten 
 for several days.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.033
(Singing softly)

14:06.067 --> 14:07.633
And I have none 
 of the resources left

14:07.667 --> 14:10.400
Necessary for continuing 
 this journey.

14:12.233 --> 14:16.500
And alas, I have lost 
 my path somewhat,

14:16.533 --> 14:19.100
Which is now patently clear.

14:21.367 --> 14:28.267
*

14:28.300 --> 14:29.433
(Horse snorting)

14:38.200 --> 14:39.433
(Pigeons cooing)

14:47.333 --> 14:49.067
Agh!

14:49.100 --> 14:50.367
Please, don't shoot us!

14:50.400 --> 14:52.033
JONATHAN:
Who are you?

14:52.067 --> 14:53.233
We're common students
at the city seminary!

14:53.267 --> 14:57.067
Students?
S-s-seminary, uh-huh.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.067
What about some food,
to eat?

14:58.100 --> 14:59.133
Ah--
To eat!

14:59.167 --> 15:00.133
Yes, to eat. Uh-huh?

15:00.167 --> 15:01.367
Yes. It's to eat.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.400
Here's to new friends.

15:04.433 --> 15:08.200
(Monks chanting in background)

15:08.233 --> 15:10.700
BLOND MONK:
So, you're a scientist.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.533
Ah! We're scientists.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.133
I'm Gorobets.
I study rhetoric.

15:15.167 --> 15:16.767
And he's a theologian,
Khalyava.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.600
Right. Is the city far?

15:18.633 --> 15:19.700
No, but there is
a village close by.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.233
Hm?
Oh yes.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.767
Oh!

15:22.800 --> 15:23.767
It's close!

15:23.800 --> 15:25.233
Oh yes.

15:25.267 --> 15:26.267
I wouldn't send
an enemy there.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.600
Why?

15:27.633 --> 15:29.467
Around a year ago,
a friend of ours

15:29.500 --> 15:32.200
Was there with us
and suddenly vanished.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.433
A scientist?

15:33.467 --> 15:34.733
Yes, a scientist.
Philosopher.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.133
Khoma Brutus.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.533
So, about a year ago,

15:38.567 --> 15:40.467
Me, Khoma and Khalyava

15:40.500 --> 15:43.300
Passed through here
on the way home

15:43.333 --> 15:44.600
For summer vacation.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.500
Either it was the fog,

15:46.533 --> 15:47.700
Or maybe the devil
spun us round,

15:47.733 --> 15:50.433
But we completely
lost our way.

15:58.467 --> 16:01.167
Oh! Look at him!

16:02.300 --> 16:03.467
OLD WOMAN:
Stop that!

16:03.500 --> 16:06.100
Have some mercy Gramp--
er, Granny.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.367
I thought the Lord was
supposed to provide for you.

16:10.133 --> 16:14.200
* Charity, charity

16:14.233 --> 16:17.733
* May the Lord
look on you *
Stop that racket.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.267
Enough now!

16:19.300 --> 16:21.267
(Singing trails off)

16:21.300 --> 16:23.767
All right then.
Come inside.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.300
(Snickering)

16:27.500 --> 16:29.600
This way.

16:50.233 --> 16:53.333
Do you, uh,
remember how this goes?

16:53.367 --> 16:55.167
Sir, oh please
buy some food?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.767
(Laughing)

16:57.800 --> 16:59.633
(Laughing)

17:05.067 --> 17:08.367
That witch wanted me.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.067
She tried to grope me
with her filthy hands.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.133
All women are witches.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.200
And the market women?
Witches.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.400
(Groaning)

17:33.600 --> 17:35.733
(Breathing heavily)

17:55.533 --> 18:10.467
*

18:17.067 --> 18:18.200
(Gasping)

18:20.733 --> 18:21.800
Listen, Granny,

18:21.833 --> 18:25.467
It's a fasting week.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.767
I couldn't sin against that.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.033
Not even for a thousand
gold coins.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.267
Don't, don't, don't!

18:31.300 --> 18:33.633
You're too old.
You're too old!

18:36.167 --> 18:42.200
*

18:42.233 --> 18:43.600
(Cackling)

18:43.633 --> 18:45.067
Aahh!

18:53.600 --> 18:56.233
Ahh!

18:56.267 --> 19:10.333
*

19:10.367 --> 19:13.767
(Birds squawking)

19:13.800 --> 19:15.533
(Cackling)

19:15.567 --> 19:18.133
Aaaah!

19:18.167 --> 19:19.733
Ooooh!

19:22.800 --> 19:24.600
GOROBETS: 
 The crazy old woman was 
 actually Pannochka.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.467
She was a witch.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.467
He knew that, 
 and I knew that for sure.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.667
(Splatting)

19:42.467 --> 19:44.200
(Laughing)

19:44.233 --> 19:45.500
"Ha ha ha ha."

19:45.533 --> 19:47.300
You think it's funny?
All right then.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.800
You listen to me.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.500
He just vanished
into thin air.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.767
Let me taste
a bit of that.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.133
Ah, certainly!

19:57.767 --> 19:59.200
Ah?

19:59.233 --> 20:01.100
It's our best,
from Khortytsa.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.200
What do you think?

20:02.233 --> 20:03.733
It's not bad.

20:03.767 --> 20:08.233
Unlike the village where
Hell's evil is all around.

20:08.267 --> 20:10.333
That's definitely not good.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.400
Evil that not even
our Lord God can stop.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.600
PAISIY:
In the name of the Father,

20:16.633 --> 20:19.767
The Son and the Holy Spirit.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.300
With this symbol
of our Lord's majesty,

20:24.333 --> 20:28.233
We complete the circle.

20:28.267 --> 20:31.267
Ah, so we are prisoners
in our own village prison, eh?

20:31.300 --> 20:32.367
Puh!

20:32.400 --> 20:35.567
Merciful Lord!

20:35.600 --> 20:37.700
Please help me
to protect my children

20:37.733 --> 20:39.533
From these devil spirits!

20:39.567 --> 20:42.600
And let them know nothing
of what is locked away

20:42.633 --> 20:44.133
In the old church!

20:46.233 --> 20:49.533
Show me a sign!

20:49.567 --> 20:51.133
Be my shepherd!

20:51.167 --> 20:54.200
(Wind whooshing)

20:54.233 --> 20:56.433
Show them the misery
that is awaiting

20:56.467 --> 21:00.100
If they do not choose
to listen to me!

21:00.133 --> 21:02.200
(Wind whooshing)

21:05.633 --> 21:07.400
(Frightened whimpering)

21:13.667 --> 21:15.100
(Frightened chatter)

21:26.300 --> 21:28.633
(Squawking)

21:31.100 --> 21:32.700
(Snarling)

21:37.367 --> 21:39.233
(Woman screaming)

21:44.300 --> 21:45.700
Did you hear that?

21:45.733 --> 21:47.167
So are you convinced now?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.300
You said that the uh--

21:48.333 --> 21:50.033
That the monster
had nine horns,

21:50.067 --> 21:51.467
Nine great horns.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.267
Seven horns!
Seven.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.233
Let's go, let's go.

21:55.267 --> 21:56.633
KHALYAVA:
Run!

21:56.667 --> 22:00.200
If you're going on,
it's without us.

22:05.567 --> 22:07.133
That's a funny story.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.533
Hey!

22:08.567 --> 22:11.400
Colleagues!

22:14.300 --> 22:15.633
(Horse whinnying)

22:15.667 --> 22:18.333
Shh, shh.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.733
(Horses whinnying anxiously)

22:30.300 --> 22:45.100
*

22:45.133 --> 22:46.200
Wait! Wait!

22:46.233 --> 22:49.300
Where are you going?

22:49.333 --> 22:51.500
Stop!

22:53.500 --> 22:56.533
Stop, I say!

22:56.567 --> 22:58.200
(Growling)

23:01.533 --> 23:03.767
(Gears clicking)

23:03.800 --> 23:05.433
(Horses whinnying)

23:05.467 --> 23:06.600
Hyah!

23:11.100 --> 23:12.233
(Cranking)

23:16.300 --> 23:17.733
(Snarling)

23:20.467 --> 23:33.067
*

23:33.100 --> 23:35.067
(Snarling)

23:51.100 --> 23:52.733
(Gunshot)

23:52.767 --> 23:54.700
(Growling)

24:04.667 --> 24:07.567
(Crowd chanting in distance)

24:07.600 --> 24:10.733
(Men singing indistinctly)

24:10.767 --> 24:14.467
(Wolf howling in distance)

24:14.500 --> 24:17.133
(Growling nearby)

24:17.167 --> 24:27.200
*

24:27.233 --> 24:28.567
(Horses whinnying)

24:30.833 --> 24:32.200
No!

24:33.633 --> 24:36.067
Ah! Ah! Ah!

24:37.133 --> 24:39.400
The apocalypse.

24:41.133 --> 24:43.033
(Horses whinnying)

24:43.067 --> 24:56.467
*

25:00.267 --> 25:01.400
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

25:09.367 --> 25:23.100
*

25:23.133 --> 25:25.467
--protected by armour
made from fire.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.100
The horses' heads were like
those of lions,

25:28.133 --> 25:29.233
And fire and smoke--

25:29.267 --> 25:32.100
He's coming!

25:32.133 --> 25:34.267
(People shouting)

25:34.300 --> 25:41.333
*

25:41.367 --> 25:43.667
(Horses whinnying)

25:59.333 --> 26:02.033
And here is the sign!

26:02.067 --> 26:06.100
A messenger sent from Satan
has pierced our circle!

26:06.133 --> 26:08.400
(Horse snorting)

26:08.433 --> 26:11.100
What kind of messenger
of Satan is he

26:11.133 --> 26:12.667
If his knees are knocking
together in fear?

26:18.567 --> 26:22.067
He might just pass
with a good scrub.

26:26.767 --> 26:30.100
(People murmuring)

26:36.833 --> 26:39.267
(Low growling)

26:44.267 --> 26:45.433
Master Sotnik.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.567
He's alone.
There's no one else.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.667
A servant of Satan!

27:02.700 --> 27:05.067
What's all this noise?

27:05.100 --> 27:07.100
The Devil's scripture.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.433
"Jonathan Green".

27:15.500 --> 27:16.667
Jonathan Green.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.667
Yes, yes, yes--
Jonathan Green!

27:18.700 --> 27:21.333
Scientist, cartographer.

27:21.367 --> 27:23.600
I am the subject of Her Majesty,

27:23.633 --> 27:27.267
The Queen of England,

27:27.300 --> 27:28.767
Recently renamed
the United Kingdom.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.767
MAN:
Not a scientist.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.133
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.

27:34.633 --> 27:37.500
If he's the best
his country has to offer,

27:37.533 --> 27:40.400
We're in terrible trouble.

27:40.433 --> 27:42.733
(People laughing)

27:42.767 --> 27:45.233
(Growling)

27:45.267 --> 27:49.300
"Looking through my spyglass,
I could well discern

27:49.333 --> 27:52.567
Leaping savages
and their frantic gestures.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.800
I was sure they were
preparing themselves

27:54.833 --> 27:56.067
For a terrible meal
of human flesh."

27:56.100 --> 27:58.633
What are you reading?

27:58.667 --> 28:00.733
Shh.

28:00.767 --> 28:03.433
This is the latest story
by Mister Defoe.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.633
It's about the adventures
of Robinson Crusoe.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.400
Of all the great writers
this country's produced,

28:07.433 --> 28:10.033
You choose to read him.

28:10.067 --> 28:11.467
(Baby cooing)

28:11.500 --> 28:14.300
And what, Madam, is this?

28:14.333 --> 28:15.500
Father please,
give it back.

28:15.533 --> 28:17.067
It's from him,
isn't it? Hm?

28:17.100 --> 28:20.400
Cease any contact with
that worthless specimen.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.200
I demand that in my own home
there is nothing

28:23.233 --> 28:24.233
To remind me
of the wretch.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.733
Quiet, Father.

28:25.767 --> 28:27.267
You are forgetting
that this wretch

28:27.300 --> 28:29.067
Ha!
is the father of my child.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.733
You never thought that
perhaps at this very moment

28:30.767 --> 28:32.800
He is somewhere,
surrounded by savages,

28:32.833 --> 28:34.700
In deadly peril
on some desert island?

28:34.733 --> 28:36.267
Savages?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.400
Island? What island?

28:38.433 --> 28:41.433
It is the biggest continent
of them all.

28:41.467 --> 28:44.367
Your Mr. Jonathan 
"I am a cartographer" Green

28:44.400 --> 28:47.067
Is in the middle
of that continent.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.267
A continent?

28:49.300 --> 28:50.600
FATHER:
"Savages" my ass!

28:54.267 --> 28:56.367
Excuse me Sir,
excuse me!

28:56.400 --> 28:58.633
Um, I have some
very important equipment

28:58.667 --> 29:00.200
Damaged in my carriage.

29:00.233 --> 29:02.167
It's vital to me,
you understand.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.133
It's the fifth
measuring wheel.

29:04.167 --> 29:05.167
It measures distance.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.400
The wheel?
Yes Sir.

29:06.433 --> 29:08.133
Ah!

29:08.167 --> 29:10.500
Our blacksmith's good at making
that kind of mechanism.

29:10.533 --> 29:12.633
Ah.
Let's go.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.700
He made a contraption
that produces horilka,

29:15.733 --> 29:18.467
A vodka so clear
it looks like tears.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.667
Yes, I'm very well aware
of what horilka is.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.200
It's not that, no no.

29:22.233 --> 29:24.233
It's a-- it's a
mechanical thing.

29:24.267 --> 29:25.433
It's a mechanism.

29:25.467 --> 29:27.067
Ah, same shit.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.067
Did I invite the commons in?

29:31.100 --> 29:32.633
It's me, Taras.

29:32.667 --> 29:35.567
Wait! Here, I brought you
a British customer.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.567
A scientist.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.633
A scientist?

29:37.667 --> 29:39.233
Yeah. Look at his carriage.

29:39.267 --> 29:41.300
Hey, what do you think
of this, huh?

29:41.333 --> 29:42.700
TARAS:
An impressive rig.

29:42.733 --> 29:45.533
Yeah, if it moves
and turns on its own.

29:45.567 --> 29:47.133
Think you can fix it?

29:48.633 --> 29:52.100
It wasn't made by God,
so yeah.

29:52.133 --> 29:53.200
No, no, no, no.

29:53.233 --> 29:54.733
The work of Dutch masters.

29:56.833 --> 29:58.067
The Dutch masters,
you say?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.433
Heh. Well try this!

30:03.467 --> 30:05.400
(Grunting)
Well, Mr. Scientist,

30:05.433 --> 30:07.300
Remind you of anything?

30:07.333 --> 30:08.667
Huh?

30:08.700 --> 30:11.267
Oh!

30:14.533 --> 30:16.033
It's like the drawings
of Leonardo Da Vinci.

30:16.067 --> 30:17.533
I have no idea
what a Da Vinci is,

30:17.567 --> 30:20.333
But I do know how
to make it fly.

30:20.367 --> 30:21.433
That I know.

30:21.467 --> 30:22.567
Will it?

30:22.600 --> 30:23.767
Yeah,

30:23.800 --> 30:26.433
But to land, not so much.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.567
But first I invite the best
scientist to my house to eat.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.467
You can't say no.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.167
It's been a long time since
we had a foreigner around here.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.367
Will he repair it?

30:36.400 --> 30:37.700
TARAS:
Your carriage will be fine.

30:37.733 --> 30:39.167
(Voices trailing off)

30:40.433 --> 30:42.533
Why are you shielding him?

30:42.567 --> 30:46.367
Now that's not why
I called you here, Father.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.133
It's been a whole year
since my darling daughter died.

30:49.167 --> 30:53.100
Let's have her funeral
at the old church tomorrow.

30:53.133 --> 30:56.633
My men can clear the road
in no time.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.667
I didn't hear that.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.233
Don't think it.

31:00.267 --> 31:01.567
That road is closed.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.667
I waited nine days,
and then forty days.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.400
And now a full 12 months!

31:05.433 --> 31:06.700
Pray to God.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.700
Patience alone is nothing.

31:09.733 --> 31:12.300
There's one thing
I still don't know.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.100
What was it you saw
inside that church?

31:28.833 --> 31:31.167
Petrus! Petrus!

31:32.667 --> 31:34.467
Yes, Master Sotnik.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.433
What's this?
Read it to me.

31:37.833 --> 31:40.367
It's a map of the area.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.700
Aha.

31:42.733 --> 31:45.533
Go and bring him here,
that scientist.

31:45.567 --> 31:48.500
Whoa.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.600
But quietly.

31:49.633 --> 31:53.367
(Jonathan singing quietly)

32:01.333 --> 32:03.400
(Door creaking open)

32:07.100 --> 32:08.467
Uh, excuse me?

32:08.500 --> 32:11.067
Hello?

32:11.100 --> 32:12.333
Are you deaf?

32:12.367 --> 32:13.433
Good, all right,
we're not speaking.

32:13.467 --> 32:15.633
That's fine by me.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.000
At least tell me your name.

32:37.733 --> 32:39.067
The girl's struck dumb.

32:40.533 --> 32:42.233
Mmm.

32:42.267 --> 32:45.700
What delicate saplings
the Devil has brought me.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.133
Would you like me to rub
your back when you're dry?

32:50.167 --> 32:52.467
Thank you, but uh--

32:52.500 --> 32:54.533
Hey!

32:54.567 --> 32:56.467
The other students like it.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.667
(Snickering)

32:58.700 --> 33:01.600
(Nervous chuckling)

33:01.633 --> 33:03.633
Spare us.

33:09.067 --> 33:11.100
Of course.

33:11.133 --> 33:14.233
The old woman,
Khoma Brut.

33:14.267 --> 33:16.767
This is where it all happened.

33:24.667 --> 33:36.567
*

33:36.600 --> 33:38.433
Ah-- ooh!
Oh, hello.

33:38.467 --> 33:40.267
(Chuckling)

33:40.300 --> 33:41.800
If you're taking a flight,

33:41.833 --> 33:44.000
You should dress first.

33:48.567 --> 33:50.733
Look, is there
a problem? Hm?

33:50.767 --> 33:52.767
Master Sotnik would like
to talk to you.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.533
In secret. Shh.

33:59.133 --> 34:01.500
(Door creaking)

34:01.533 --> 34:04.667
Father, tell me
what is wrong.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.133
Sotnik won't stop
asking questions.

34:07.167 --> 34:08.467
(Scoffing)

34:08.500 --> 34:10.433
It has been over a year.

34:10.467 --> 34:13.167
He's thinking of
ordering his labourers

34:13.199 --> 34:15.533
To clear the roadway.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.266
(Laughing)

34:17.300 --> 34:19.632
I'd like to know which
of his labourers

34:19.667 --> 34:22.266
He thinks is willing to risk his
skin around this cursed place!

34:22.300 --> 34:24.199
Our village is gladly
short of heroes.

34:24.233 --> 34:26.300
(Chuckling)

34:26.333 --> 34:28.333
Outsiders then.

34:36.467 --> 34:39.467
Master Sotnik,
the scientist.

34:39.500 --> 34:40.667
Master Cartographer,

34:40.699 --> 34:42.167
Do you believe in God?

34:42.199 --> 34:43.733
How to put it?

34:43.766 --> 34:46.300
I'm a scientist.

34:46.333 --> 34:49.199
That means you don't
believe in the Devil.

34:49.233 --> 34:50.567
Um, no.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.199
Ah, that's good.

34:53.233 --> 34:56.233
I want you to make another map
like this one,

34:56.266 --> 34:58.733
But put the church
at the centre.

34:58.767 --> 35:01.300
So I can see all my land.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.767
That's good.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.033
I must tell you that uh,

35:04.067 --> 35:06.033
It'll take time to um,

35:06.067 --> 35:08.133
Complete.

35:08.167 --> 35:10.700
For a thousand gold coins?

35:10.733 --> 35:13.533
Where is Satan's messenger?

35:13.567 --> 35:16.267
OVERKO:
My guess is he's holed up
at Hannah's water mill.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.433
(Dog barking in distance)

35:22.367 --> 35:25.400
Here, for a start.

35:25.433 --> 35:27.233
I'll need uh, an assistant.

35:27.267 --> 35:28.433
I'll get you one now.

35:28.467 --> 35:30.733
Begin at the old church.

35:30.767 --> 35:35.633
Let no one see you.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.633
Master Sotnik,
the path is cleared.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.367
We should go.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.467
Come on, hurry up.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.733
Yes, wait, wait.

35:45.767 --> 35:48.033
Hurry!

35:48.067 --> 35:49.333
(Horses whinnying)

35:49.367 --> 35:51.533
My horse can see things
we can't.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.300
There must be
a devil of sorts.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.467
Come on, you stubborn beast!

35:55.500 --> 35:57.733
(Whip cracking)
Hyah!

36:01.400 --> 36:03.533
(Growling)

36:05.333 --> 36:07.167
About you talking to Sotnik-

36:07.200 --> 36:08.733
Not a word to anyone.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.500
It's better for us that way.

36:13.267 --> 36:15.267
(Loon calling)

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
So, if Father Paisiy
is right--

36:18.233 --> 36:19.367
Let's go see.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.633
Where's the scientist?

36:30.667 --> 36:32.433
He is here!

36:32.467 --> 36:34.733
Master Scientist!

36:34.767 --> 36:37.100
(Chuckling)

36:37.133 --> 36:39.367
Let us pour some horilka
for our honoured guest.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.233
Trust me, you've tasted
nothing like this!

36:43.767 --> 36:46.767
YAVTUKH:
Smells good.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.300
TARAS:
Everyone!

36:50.533 --> 36:51.667
To us.
To us.

36:55.133 --> 36:57.067
Ah!

36:57.100 --> 36:58.567
So what science
do you do? Huh?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.200
Look, Panas,

37:00.233 --> 37:01.767
You were talking.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.167
Right? You're an expert.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.300
On scientists.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.167
Well I've heard there are some

37:06.200 --> 37:07.267
Who stare at the stars.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.367
What kind of science is that?

37:09.400 --> 37:10.367
Stargazing science?

37:10.400 --> 37:12.367
I know what I am talking about.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.300
They stare.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.467
They stare at the stars
through glasses, like this.

37:16.500 --> 37:17.700
Huh? Huh?

37:17.733 --> 37:18.800
Ah!

37:18.833 --> 37:20.667
(Men laughing)

37:20.700 --> 37:22.133
Hey Taras, this is empty!

37:22.167 --> 37:25.367
Trouble.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.133
That's what we got
from the last scientist.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.800
He changed our village,

37:28.833 --> 37:30.433
And not for the better.

37:30.467 --> 37:31.467
He was a philosopher.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.667
Khoma Brut.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.367
Brutus.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.600
(Suspenseful music)

37:45.533 --> 37:47.367
Tell me how you happen

37:47.400 --> 37:49.367
To know Khoma Brutus.

37:53.267 --> 37:54.333
He's well known.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.700
Everyone knows that name.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.667
He's known, all right.

38:01.067 --> 38:02.733
Master Sotnik had heard the name
of a seminary student

38:02.767 --> 38:06.033
In our village,
a student by the name

38:06.067 --> 38:07.600
Of Khoma Brutus.

38:09.333 --> 38:10.767
Please let me go.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.667
OVERKO:
Dorosh and I delivered Khoma

38:12.700 --> 38:14.800
To watch over
Sotnik's daughter.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.633
Dogs were barking,
wolves howling.

38:30.300 --> 38:33.400
(Whispering)
Holy Mother of God.

38:33.433 --> 38:36.367
Through the priest and through
our Lord Jesus Christ,

38:36.400 --> 38:39.133
Our one true God,
forgive us our sins.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.367
Amen.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.633
* We beg you oh Lord
to embrace in us *

38:46.667 --> 38:49.600
* In the eternal life
that is given to you *

38:49.633 --> 38:52.667
* And your blessed ministry

38:52.700 --> 38:54.300
* In the name of the Father,
and the Son *

38:54.333 --> 38:56.267
* Amen

38:58.167 --> 39:01.667
What sort of a priest would I be
if I was afraid of a corpse?

39:01.700 --> 39:04.200
Oh, I wish I could
smoke in here.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.033
Ah.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.233
Oh, good tobacco.

39:21.267 --> 39:23.800
Her face.

39:23.833 --> 39:27.533
Her beautiful face
draws me to her.

39:27.567 --> 39:30.067
(Breathing heavily)

39:30.100 --> 39:33.633
Even in death, so beautiful.

39:45.533 --> 39:49.267
(Laboured breathing)

39:59.833 --> 40:01.600
(Wind whooshing)

40:21.433 --> 40:24.033
(Stretching noises)

40:34.100 --> 40:47.500
*

41:00.367 --> 41:10.167
*

41:10.200 --> 41:13.267
(Bell tolling)

41:13.300 --> 41:15.300
(Bell silenced)

41:15.333 --> 41:30.267
*

41:32.767 --> 41:35.133
(Shrieking)

41:41.133 --> 41:56.067
*

42:14.233 --> 42:16.400
(Rooster crowing)

42:36.400 --> 42:37.700
JONATHAN:
Listen, where is this church?

42:37.733 --> 42:39.267
Hm?

42:39.300 --> 42:41.733
Tell us why do you
want to know.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.233
Well, Master Sotnik and I
were thinking of maybe,

42:44.267 --> 42:46.700
You know.

42:46.733 --> 42:48.500
Pfft, forget it.
It's nothing.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.100
Chalk is the most
important thing we own.

42:50.133 --> 42:52.333
Draw a circle around you

42:52.367 --> 42:54.267
And not even the Devil
can touch you.

42:54.300 --> 42:56.433
Or a witch.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.033
All women are witches

43:02.067 --> 43:04.200
And they have small,
curly tails.

43:04.233 --> 43:06.100
Who's that food for?

43:06.133 --> 43:08.133
Are you going 
to the the swamp?
Is that true?

43:08.167 --> 43:09.233
JONATHAN:
Well, it's a superstition.
Don't you dare--

43:09.267 --> 43:13.033
Legends. Imagination.

43:13.067 --> 43:16.433
PANAS:
Maybe not in Europe, but here,

43:16.467 --> 43:18.600
All women are witches.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.667
JONATHAN:
Yavtukh, he's drinking.

43:27.700 --> 43:29.433
Hey!

43:29.467 --> 43:31.333
(Men grunting and singing)

43:31.367 --> 43:33.567
(Singing indistinctly)

43:39.433 --> 43:49.300
*

43:49.333 --> 43:51.400
(Singing continues)

43:56.333 --> 43:57.633
(Gunshot)

43:57.667 --> 43:59.333
(Music and singing stops)

43:59.367 --> 44:00.400
It's supposed to be a song!

44:00.433 --> 44:02.600
Stop tearing your throats out!

44:02.633 --> 44:04.300
What?

44:04.333 --> 44:06.433
TARAS:
Don't like it, too bad!

44:06.467 --> 44:09.133
Who do you think you are,
giving us orders?

44:09.167 --> 44:10.500
And since when
are you in charge--

44:10.533 --> 44:11.700
Whoa, whoa!

44:11.733 --> 44:13.767
Let me go!

44:13.800 --> 44:15.400
(Groaning)

44:15.433 --> 44:17.533
(Mumbling)

44:19.367 --> 44:20.567
No, no, no,
don't go!
Shh.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.700
We're just getting
started here.

44:22.733 --> 44:24.733
Don't spoil this.

44:24.767 --> 44:26.400
You'll insult us.

44:26.433 --> 44:29.400
Was there any evidence
of Khoma's fate?

44:29.433 --> 44:30.567
Evidence?

44:32.633 --> 44:33.800
Here it is.

44:33.833 --> 44:36.533
Evidence I saw
with my own eyes.

44:36.567 --> 44:39.200
But thanks to the curse,

44:39.233 --> 44:40.700
I have only the one now.

44:40.733 --> 44:42.600
My other is gone.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.733
Now listen to the rest.

44:54.100 --> 44:56.633
It's always scary,
the first night.

45:00.567 --> 45:03.267
I'm not scared.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.500
I'm not scared now.

45:05.533 --> 45:07.167
Help me, Lord.

45:11.367 --> 45:13.067
Okay.

45:13.100 --> 45:15.500
(Axe hammering)

45:20.067 --> 45:21.233
(Thunder crashing)

45:32.067 --> 45:34.667
(Thunder rumbling outside)

45:55.700 --> 45:58.233
(Wood creaking)

46:17.100 --> 46:18.433
(Crashing)

46:24.633 --> 46:38.700
*

46:38.733 --> 46:41.300
Help me, God!

46:41.333 --> 46:43.733
Ahh!

46:53.067 --> 46:55.000
Ugh!

47:02.067 --> 47:04.400
(Crashing)

47:04.433 --> 47:07.733
(Whooshing)

47:12.333 --> 47:14.567
(Slow motion humming)

47:14.600 --> 47:16.800
(Thudding)

47:16.833 --> 47:18.500
(Groaning)

47:23.433 --> 47:24.633
(Grunting)

47:30.733 --> 47:32.400
(Echoed shrieking)

47:36.400 --> 47:39.367
(Shrieking)

47:42.367 --> 47:44.633
Aahhh!

47:49.433 --> 47:52.233
Aahh!

47:52.267 --> 47:54.600
(Slow motion humming)

48:00.067 --> 48:02.533
(Satanic whispering noises)

48:02.567 --> 48:04.033
(Grunting)

48:04.067 --> 48:07.667
(Shrieking)

48:12.233 --> 48:14.433
(Rooster crowing)

48:16.533 --> 48:17.667
(Shrieking)

48:20.733 --> 48:23.367
(Groaning)

48:39.200 --> 48:41.433
(Squeaking)

48:45.533 --> 48:47.333
(Gagging)

48:47.367 --> 48:48.700
(Squeaking)

48:56.333 --> 48:57.400
(Snarling)

48:57.433 --> 48:59.567
(Creatures squeaking)

49:05.200 --> 49:06.400
(Gagging noises)

49:06.433 --> 49:09.233
(Wind whooshing)

49:09.267 --> 49:12.267
(Growling)

49:16.200 --> 49:17.367
(Chittering)

49:17.400 --> 49:19.133
(Grunting)

49:29.133 --> 49:30.767
(Growling)

49:34.300 --> 49:36.700
(Creatures chittering)

49:42.333 --> 49:44.400
(Roaring)

49:57.733 --> 49:59.500
(Growling)

49:59.533 --> 50:00.600
TARAS:
I can't see him.

50:00.633 --> 50:03.467
Where is he?

50:03.500 --> 50:05.233
He's under the table.

50:09.300 --> 50:12.400
My ears must be clogged.

50:12.433 --> 50:15.300
He kicked my head!

50:15.333 --> 50:17.300
(Cackling)

50:24.367 --> 50:27.667
Look, he wants to run.

50:36.067 --> 50:38.200
(Shattering)

50:40.733 --> 50:42.067
(Squeaking)

50:44.467 --> 50:45.600
(Creatures screaming)

50:48.633 --> 50:50.700
Ah.

51:08.333 --> 51:10.200
I can't see anything!

51:14.400 --> 51:16.333
Don't let him get to the chalk.

51:16.367 --> 51:17.500
Turn around.

51:21.267 --> 51:23.467
Keep him away from the chalk.

51:25.167 --> 51:27.200
The chalk!

51:27.233 --> 51:28.667
Somebody!

51:28.700 --> 51:30.467
Get him!

51:30.500 --> 51:33.167
Don't let him have the chalk!

51:48.600 --> 51:51.167
Pick up my head.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.667
I don't see him.

52:00.267 --> 52:02.367
Get him.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.133
There you stay.

52:15.133 --> 52:17.133
Pannochka!

52:19.367 --> 52:20.500
(Cackling)

52:21.833 --> 52:23.167
Pannochka.

52:27.167 --> 52:30.633
PANNOCHKA:
Can't find him.

52:30.667 --> 52:32.767
Can't see.

52:35.467 --> 52:39.267
I call upon you, Viy!

52:39.300 --> 52:41.667
Viy!

52:46.667 --> 52:48.233
(Chittering)

52:48.267 --> 52:50.367
(Rumbling)

52:53.167 --> 52:55.767
(Bubbling)

53:11.433 --> 53:13.767
(Squeaking)

53:25.367 --> 53:27.500
(Panting)

53:27.533 --> 53:31.367
DEEP SATANIC VOICE:
Open my eyes.

53:48.267 --> 53:50.200
(Growling)

53:50.233 --> 53:54.067
Now he belongs to you.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.200
(Whispering)
We need you to find

54:05.233 --> 54:06.800
Who's inside the skin.

54:06.833 --> 54:10.333
Show that soul

54:10.367 --> 54:13.267
And I will leave you
among the living.

54:28.667 --> 54:31.200
(Rooster crowing)

54:54.367 --> 54:58.233
WOMAN:
So, you saw the monster.

54:58.267 --> 55:02.133
There are many.

55:02.167 --> 55:07.100
They live in
and among the people.

55:07.133 --> 55:08.733
You do not carry a cross,

55:08.767 --> 55:12.800
But when your scientific
reasoning fails you

55:12.833 --> 55:16.667
You hide behind
the chalk circle.

55:21.667 --> 55:24.767
Do as she asks.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.700
Find out who is in
the sheep's skin.

55:30.400 --> 55:33.067
Help her find her way.

55:33.100 --> 55:35.667
By doing so,
you will find yours.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.600
(Birds chirping outside)

55:44.633 --> 55:46.600
Master Scientist,

55:46.633 --> 55:49.400
Master Sotnik is, uh,

55:49.433 --> 55:51.633
Very angry.

55:55.633 --> 55:57.700
(Crowing)

56:18.800 --> 56:21.533
Give me that.

56:21.567 --> 56:23.400
What's become
of the scientist?

56:23.433 --> 56:26.100
He's gone.

56:26.133 --> 56:27.667
So, he packed his things,

56:27.700 --> 56:29.200
Ran out of the village

56:29.233 --> 56:31.167
And ran off.

56:33.233 --> 56:35.433
That foreign scientist,

56:35.467 --> 56:37.700
Satan's messenger has gone

56:37.733 --> 56:39.533
To the forbidden church.

56:39.567 --> 56:41.600
Speak up, little one.

56:41.633 --> 56:43.500
What's going to happen
to us, my Father?

56:43.533 --> 56:45.300
Get ready.
Gather the people.

56:45.333 --> 56:46.733
Save us, Father Paisiy.

56:46.767 --> 56:48.367
WOMAN:
What are we going to do?

56:48.400 --> 56:50.400
Why the hell do you think
he went into the forest?

56:50.433 --> 56:51.633
Sniffing for your treasure.

56:51.667 --> 56:53.067
Well it's really not funny.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.567
What if he goes
inside the church?

56:57.233 --> 56:58.400
Then when Sotnik asks,

56:58.433 --> 57:01.433
"Did you happen to see

57:01.467 --> 57:03.433
The thousand gold coins
meant for Khoma?

57:03.467 --> 57:06.100
The ones I dropped in fear?"

57:06.133 --> 57:07.567
Oh yes.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.333
I saw you.

57:09.367 --> 57:10.733
You took them.

57:12.733 --> 57:14.433
I'll hold it close,

57:14.467 --> 57:16.267
Just as any confession.

57:16.300 --> 57:18.400
Go.

57:23.767 --> 57:25.600
Master Scientist,

57:25.633 --> 57:28.633
You can do as you like,
but I won't go in.

57:28.667 --> 57:31.067
Some assistant, eh?

57:33.233 --> 57:35.100
Look, at least
hold the rope for me.

57:35.133 --> 57:37.300
Do I have to?

57:42.767 --> 57:45.500
Petrus! Hold it tighter.

57:51.067 --> 57:53.033
I'll look around the swamp,

57:53.067 --> 57:54.633
While you go and
check out the church.

57:54.667 --> 58:07.067
*

58:11.767 --> 58:13.167
(Grunting)

58:20.333 --> 58:33.100
*

58:47.233 --> 58:48.367
(Grunting)

58:56.633 --> 58:57.767
(Rumbling)

59:03.567 --> 59:05.367
First I'll buy you
some new reins.

59:05.400 --> 59:07.633
And a saddle.

59:11.833 --> 59:13.500
(Bird calling)

59:16.200 --> 59:17.533
Here goes.

59:25.600 --> 59:28.133
We have enough for everything.

59:28.167 --> 59:29.467
Look at this.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.300
(Chuckling)

59:31.333 --> 59:33.400
Look how much money we've got!

59:36.100 --> 59:37.233
Hold it tight!

59:37.267 --> 59:39.333
(Jonathan 's voice ringing out)

59:44.733 --> 59:47.100
What am I doing?

59:47.133 --> 59:48.500
This is crazy.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.033
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:23.333
Petrus!

01:00:23.367 --> 01:00:24.500
Pull my stuff up!

01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:27.100
I'm gonna spend all day here.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.733
You just stay there.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.700
Let's get Overko.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:36.767
(Horse whinnying softly)

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.333
Quiet!

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.400
JONATHAN:
 I can only suppose

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.633
That it was the shock 
 of the last few days

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:59.633
And my body's tiredness 
 that so completely distorted

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:01.767
My first impressions.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.233
They remind me of pirates.

01:01:03.267 --> 01:01:05.233
Have I frightened you, 
 my dear?

01:01:05.267 --> 01:01:07.133
No no, my darling.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:10.100
You see, first impressions 
 are sometimes deceptive.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.167
(Chuckling)

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.633
DOROSH:
Overko!

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:21.267
To hell with you.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.233
Overko.

01:01:25.067 --> 01:01:26.067
What are you doing
over there?

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.500
What news, brother?

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:28.700
I found him.
I found him at the old church.

01:01:28.733 --> 01:01:30.633
Oh. Let's get him then.

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:33.033
Sure, just as soon as you
hide our money, right?

01:01:33.067 --> 01:01:34.067
(Laughing)

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.467
(Grumbling)

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.067
Go tell Paisiy,
and I'll head to the church!

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:01.400
Well Father,

01:02:01.433 --> 01:02:03.167
We rode to the church

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.600
And there he was
on the roof.

01:02:05.633 --> 01:02:07.200
And Petrus was there with him.

01:02:07.233 --> 01:02:09.700
I had Overko stay and watch.

01:02:09.733 --> 01:02:11.267
That scientist
finds anything,

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.533
He'll get a knife
in the back.

01:02:12.567 --> 01:02:14.033
Well?

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:16.600
What should our next move be?

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:19.167
Hear me, Sotnik.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.500
While you know this,

01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:24.700
The villagers
are ready to act

01:02:24.733 --> 01:02:26.767
And execute the unholy.

01:02:28.633 --> 01:02:30.433
You want a requiem for your
daughter, Master Sotnik?

01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:32.467
You'll have it.

01:02:55.667 --> 01:02:58.600
Wait here
and see what happens.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.267
This is not a priest speaking

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.467
With the power to punish
and judge you.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.767
No.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.167
You see a simple servant,

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.367
That's all.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.633
A worm anyone can tread on.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.333
That's what I
needed to hear.

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.467
But this servant,
this worm implores you,

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.500
Do not--

01:03:29.533 --> 01:03:30.767
Ah--

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.433
--do not seek explanations,

01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:34.767
For all that's in
this firmament

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.467
Is revealed to you--
It's a miracle.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.300
Let others say that
you live in darkness,

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.100
That you are ignorant.

01:03:42.133 --> 01:03:44.633
I say to seek to know all
of God's work as heresy,

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:46.400
So let go of the false
light of knowledge.

01:03:46.433 --> 01:03:48.700
It does not serve our God.

01:03:50.367 --> 01:03:52.333
What's wrong, Master Sotnik?

01:03:52.367 --> 01:03:55.300
Has the truth of God
made you uncomfortable?

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:59.033
Have you no love
for Christ's flock?

01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:04.400
Yes, that's us.
"The flock".

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:08.567
PAISIY:
Ah, Master Sotnik is fallen

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.233
Victim to his crime,

01:04:11.267 --> 01:04:12.600
And the influence of those

01:04:12.633 --> 01:04:15.367
Who've declared themselves
all-knowing!

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.267
OVERKO:
You just stay there,
Master Scientist.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.533
Stay there.

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:23.267
Fear the learned outsiders!

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.467
I see how Satan's army
is getting ever nearer.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.467
(Suspenseful music)

01:04:49.067 --> 01:04:50.467
(Squawking)

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.733
(Playing lively tune)

01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:56.100
Banish the evil ones from here,

01:04:56.133 --> 01:04:57.233
So that the ground burns up

01:04:57.267 --> 01:04:58.500
Under their feet!

01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:00.400
Hallelujah!

01:05:00.433 --> 01:05:03.033
TOWNSPEOPLE CHANTING:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

01:05:06.633 --> 01:05:08.400
Whoa!

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.167
(Grunting)

01:05:22.767 --> 01:05:24.033
Ah! Ah!

01:05:24.067 --> 01:05:25.033
Aaah!

01:05:25.067 --> 01:05:27.033
Oof.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.733
Ah!

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.367
(Grunting)

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.467
I-- I didn't intend

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.800
To come down
quite so quickly.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.600
Lift me up, Petrus.

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:43.067
Petrus, lift me up!

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.133
Agh!

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:45.267
Gah!

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.067
(Grunting)

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.700
(Panting)

01:05:50.733 --> 01:05:52.233
Master, I told you
this place is cursed--

01:05:52.267 --> 01:05:54.267
I don't care.
I need my instruments!

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.400
Just-- Petrus--
Petrus I've got--

01:05:56.433 --> 01:05:57.467
We need to know
the way.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.533
Petrus, what--

01:05:58.567 --> 01:05:59.733
Agh! Petrus!

01:05:59.767 --> 01:06:01.067
Let's go.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.067
Petrus, let me
get back up--

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.100
Run away!

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:04.467
I-- Ugh!

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.467
Run away!

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.633
(Horse snorting)

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:20.500
*

01:06:25.133 --> 01:06:26.200
Hallelujah!

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.367
ALL:
Hallelujah!

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.400
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

01:06:29.433 --> 01:06:31.767
Hallelujah!

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.167
Hallelujah!

01:06:35.767 --> 01:06:37.233
(Children shouting)

01:06:37.267 --> 01:06:39.100
Master Scientist,

01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:40.200
Go to Sotnik's house.

01:06:40.233 --> 01:06:42.067
You'll be safe there.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.533
You little pests!
Go on!

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.133
What did you see there?

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:50.300
There's devilry here.

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:51.700
You've joined them.

01:06:51.733 --> 01:06:53.667
You haven't been there!

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.033
Do not consort
with the scientist, any of you.

01:06:58.067 --> 01:06:59.400
Or the Lord's curse
be upon you!

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:01.400
Get out.

01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:02.467
Without my instruments?

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.600
You heard me.

01:07:04.633 --> 01:07:05.800
Finish the job you started.

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:07.433
Or be flayed alive.

01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:21.800
Agghhh!

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:24.233
What?

01:07:24.267 --> 01:07:25.700
You said Overko
would watch him.

01:07:25.733 --> 01:07:27.367
Who?
He's back again!

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.633
And he's not alone.

01:07:28.667 --> 01:07:30.033
He's with
Sotnik's servant.

01:07:30.067 --> 01:07:31.100
Who?

01:07:31.133 --> 01:07:32.700
"Who"?
Who do you think?

01:07:32.733 --> 01:07:34.133
Go now and
bring him to me.

01:07:34.167 --> 01:07:35.567
Uh-huh.

01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:38.767
So who again?

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.000
Petrus, of course!

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:44.467
Ah-- agh!

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:48.300
PAISIY:
Sit him down.

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.633
(Panting)

01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:50.633
Dorosh, what are you doing?

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.200
No no-- Ah!

01:07:52.233 --> 01:07:54.333
What are you doing?

01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:56.533
Aaahh!

01:07:56.567 --> 01:07:58.233
Dorosh, shut him up

01:07:58.267 --> 01:07:59.333
Or we'll have the
whole village on our hands.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.333
(Muffled noises from Petrus)

01:08:03.633 --> 01:08:04.667
Dorosh, no--

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.133
No, get the other one.

01:08:06.167 --> 01:08:07.767
What's that?
Dorosh no, please!

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.600
This isn't funny.

01:08:09.633 --> 01:08:11.733
Can we talk about this?

01:08:11.767 --> 01:08:12.767
I-- I beg you.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.533
Oh that-- Aaaagghh!

01:08:14.567 --> 01:08:16.500
What did the scientist
do at the church?

01:08:16.533 --> 01:08:19.667
Tell us why he was there and
what was he trying to find?

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.667
(Straining)

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700
Master Sotnik sent him,
to make a map.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.466
(Panting)

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.667
And the fee was
a thousand gold coins.

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.267
It's lying around
the church somewhere.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.100
PAISIY:
Good boy. Good boy.

01:08:34.133 --> 01:08:35.399
Ungh!

01:08:35.433 --> 01:08:37.233
(Groaning)

01:08:37.267 --> 01:08:39.700
From now on you'll report

01:08:39.733 --> 01:08:41.633
Everything you hear to me.

01:08:48.633 --> 01:08:50.399
Put this on
and leave it on.

01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:52.800
And no questions.

01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:54.767
Now get out of here!

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.233
I'll run away first,
before I serve you!

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.600
Find the scientist and
don't lose sight of him.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.233
Let's go and find Overko.

01:09:12.267 --> 01:09:13.767
(Sighing)

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800
Aagh!

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:17.433
(Bell clanging)

01:09:17.466 --> 01:09:21.367
(Villagers shouting)

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:22.667
Come on!

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.600
(Bell clanging in distance)

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.533
Master Scientist,
they're coming--

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:34.100
What's wrong?

01:09:34.133 --> 01:09:35.600
Paisiy sent them.
Things could get very nasty.

01:09:35.633 --> 01:09:37.167
So you've got to run away now,

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.332
And I'll run with you.

01:09:38.367 --> 01:09:39.433
You are?

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.033
I have only one condition.

01:09:41.067 --> 01:09:44.067
I'm taking Nastusya
with us.

01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:51.667
(Whispering)
Put your things together.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.033
We're running away.

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:55.233
Just take things you need.

01:09:55.267 --> 01:09:56.767
I've got food.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.500
You're not going to starve
but you have to hurry.

01:10:02.567 --> 01:10:05.067
(Snoring)

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.400
(Whispering)
Perhaps you don't want to go.

01:10:06.433 --> 01:10:08.733
In that case,

01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:10.033
I'll just have to uh,

01:10:10.067 --> 01:10:12.067
Kidnap you.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.600
I'll kidnap you and tie you up

01:10:15.633 --> 01:10:16.633
With this rope.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.333
I'll do it.

01:10:18.367 --> 01:10:20.200
I swear I'll do it.

01:10:20.233 --> 01:10:23.367
I hope you'll come,
Nastusya.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400
Do you want to?

01:10:28.067 --> 01:10:30.167
All right then,
it's goodbye.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.433
One day you'll hear

01:10:35.467 --> 01:10:38.100
That some foreign mercenary

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.033
Beheaded the brave
Cossack Petrus.

01:10:40.067 --> 01:10:42.300
Farewell.

01:10:45.067 --> 01:10:46.233
Nastusya.

01:10:48.233 --> 01:10:49.400
My love.

01:10:49.433 --> 01:10:50.600
My true darling.

01:10:50.633 --> 01:10:51.767
Petrus!

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.067
Come on!

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.333
We'll steal a boat.

01:10:55.367 --> 01:10:56.533
Be ready.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.367
Overko!

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.667
Overko!

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:13.433
Where are you?

01:11:13.467 --> 01:11:15.167
Brother!

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.133
Huagh!

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:19.300
(Horse whinnying)

01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:27.167
(Grunting)

01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:29.800
Are you crazy?

01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:31.033
You could have killed my horse!

01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:32.567
I'll kill you!

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.667
Ah, you rotten swine!

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.200
You're no better.

01:11:35.233 --> 01:11:36.233
I know you stole it.

01:11:36.267 --> 01:11:38.267
Where have you hidden it?

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.467
(Grunting)

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.133
I didn't steal it.

01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:44.767
You've completely lost your mind
over all that money.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.200
Such smart words from
a traitor and a thief!

01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:48.467
Hyah!

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.767
(Grunting)

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.733
Hah!

01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:55.500
Well Brother,

01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:57.133
Anything to say before
I cut out your tongue?

01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:58.667
Why don't we--

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.600
Settle this over a smoke, huh?

01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:02.300
(Chuckling)

01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:03.367
What do you say?

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.233
I like that better.

01:12:06.267 --> 01:12:08.100
(Chuckling)

01:12:08.133 --> 01:12:10.333
Oh, I dropped my pipe.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:11.533
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.

01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:12.733
Where's my pipe?

01:12:12.767 --> 01:12:14.133
Huh?

01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:16.133
Overko!

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.667
Overko!

01:12:23.433 --> 01:12:24.667
(Loon calling)

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.067
Nastusya--

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.267
JONATHAN:
Petrus, come here.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.500
PETRUS:
Nastusya, this way.

01:12:55.067 --> 01:12:56.167
Petrus?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.167
Row to the dead tree.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.333
I'll follow you.

01:12:58.367 --> 01:13:00.300
JONATHAN:
Where are you going?

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:04.300
(Drunken singing)

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.300
(Taras' singing continues)

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.700
Nastusya!

01:13:21.733 --> 01:13:23.433
Overko!

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:25.367
How many times have we
saved each other's necks?

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.633
Look at us now.

01:13:31.467 --> 01:13:33.167
Nastusya.

01:13:37.533 --> 01:13:40.267
Nastusya.

01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:44.333
Let us redeem our sins,

01:13:44.367 --> 01:13:46.267
And give the money back
to Sotnik.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.200
Remember the good old days?

01:13:49.233 --> 01:13:51.433
Just two brothers
with free spirits.

01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:54.300
Nastusya?

01:13:55.633 --> 01:13:57.600
(Growling)
Oh! Ah!

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.633
(Panting)

01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:01.367
Who's there?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.767
Come out so I can--

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.467
(Grunting)

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.100
Lovely pipe,
isn't it?

01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:17.300
I believe it is yours.

01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:19.500
Well, aren't you wondering
where I found it?

01:14:19.533 --> 01:14:22.267
(Struggling for breath)
Brother--

01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:28.767
(Townsfolk shouting)

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.533
Viy!

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.200
(Panting)

01:14:32.233 --> 01:14:33.300
Viy. Viy.

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:35.667
Viy. He's back.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.400
Where?

01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:38.533
Down there in the swamp.

01:14:38.567 --> 01:14:40.033
Viy!
I saw him, I saw him!

01:14:40.067 --> 01:14:42.067
The time has now come!

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.767
(Shouting)

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.133
Let us drive away the Devil's
spawn with fire and sword!

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:49.133
In the name of God!

01:14:51.233 --> 01:14:52.333
The money, there.

01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:53.533
There is the rest.

01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:56.433
Ah--

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.333
Ah, the dumb girl.

01:15:03.367 --> 01:15:06.533
Do you know
how lucky you are

01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:09.700
That you're dumb?

01:15:12.167 --> 01:15:14.267
Where is it?

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.667
Where is the money?

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.733
Give it to me.

01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:21.033
(Dogs barking, men shouting)

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.667
Come.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.667
Here, take this.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:27.667
Don't kill me!

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.500
She's trying to kill me!

01:15:29.533 --> 01:15:30.700
She killed Dorosh!

01:15:30.733 --> 01:15:32.100
Hold the witch!

01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:34.533
She's the spawn of Satan!

01:15:35.633 --> 01:15:38.100
(People shouting in distance)

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.233
Nastusya, my love--

01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:42.400
Nastusya!

01:15:42.433 --> 01:15:44.700
(Shouting continues)

01:15:47.267 --> 01:15:49.333
Holy Father,

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:51.033
It wasn't Nastusya,
I sweat it wasn't!

01:15:51.067 --> 01:15:53.267
I saw it with my own eyes,
standing there,

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.300
I saw the monster
with seven horns!

01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:56.567
It wasn't her.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.500
I saw him.
I saw the monster!

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.767
It wasn't Nastusya.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.067
It was the monster!

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.067
But my son,
she's a witch.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.400
Oh, what have I done?!

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.433
(Growling)

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.200
Agh!

01:16:19.267 --> 01:16:21.233
(Muffled screaming)

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.167
(Shouting)

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.167
What are you doing
to my daughter?!

01:16:34.567 --> 01:16:35.733
Ungh!

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:58.767
*

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.767
(Grunting)

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.300
Agh!

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.700
(Indiscernible shouting)

01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:12.333
I'm gonna kill you!

01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:23.000
(Shouting in distance)

01:17:33.667 --> 01:17:35.267
She will die.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.133
(Screaming)

01:17:53.367 --> 01:17:55.100
You used me.

01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:57.233
You didn't even want the map,
did you?

01:17:57.267 --> 01:17:59.200
It was about your daughter,

01:17:59.233 --> 01:18:01.700
And the way she died.

01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:03.067
What did you find out?

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.500
I know what happened
to her.

01:18:12.367 --> 01:18:15.333
You found out who
was under the skin?

01:18:15.367 --> 01:18:17.300
(Horses whinnying)

01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.700
Calm him the hell down!

01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:23.600
That beast understands
everything.

01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:27.167
Just find out
and I don't care how.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.067
You guarantee my safety

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.700
And for your information,
Nastusya's being attacked.

01:18:30.733 --> 01:18:32.100
They're working up
their courage

01:18:32.133 --> 01:18:33.300
To kill her,
you understand?

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.200
I'm going to handle this.

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:37.633
And right now!

01:18:37.667 --> 01:18:39.033
Uh--

01:18:47.733 --> 01:18:50.333
What hellish acts
are you up to?

01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:54.367
Let Nastusya go!

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.500
Just look at my arm!

01:18:55.533 --> 01:18:57.067
You call this sacrilege?

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.233
And Dorosh, my poor brother
who was merely--

01:19:00.267 --> 01:19:02.367
You could break her
with one finger.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.367
She's a witch!

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.567
Panas, set her free.
Now!

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.433
Not permitted.

01:19:06.467 --> 01:19:07.500
Master Sotnik.

01:19:07.533 --> 01:19:09.067
What?!

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.133
Keep back.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:12.467
Uh!

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.533
I have my orders.

01:19:13.567 --> 01:19:15.067
Whose orders?

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:16.467
And I'm not afraid
to carry them out.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.300
Whose orders?!

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.233
Mine.

01:19:20.267 --> 01:19:22.600
Watch what you say

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.500
And be very careful.

01:19:24.533 --> 01:19:26.600
No one heeds
your words anymore.

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:29.567
Sinner!

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600
Hyah!

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:31.767
Ooogh!

01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:40.500
PAISIY:
And there's another

01:19:40.533 --> 01:19:42.167
Of Satan's servants.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.300
Grab the sinner!

01:19:45.333 --> 01:19:47.700
(People shouting)

01:19:58.533 --> 01:19:59.667
WOMAN:
Get the heathen!

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:09.433
PAISIY:
Stop!

01:20:09.467 --> 01:20:11.033
We are not savages.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.567
In the pit with the witch.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.200
I'm a British citizen!

01:20:19.767 --> 01:20:22.400
Let's see how you react to fire,

01:20:22.433 --> 01:20:24.700
British citizen.

01:20:24.733 --> 01:20:27.300
Well witch,
now you have company.

01:20:48.633 --> 01:20:51.467
Let's see what
the bastard's written.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.067
JONATHAN:
 My dearest Miss Dadli.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.433
Now.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.500
"The wings of the
local inhabitants

01:20:59.533 --> 01:21:03.067
Are very similar to those
of several species of bat.

01:21:05.833 --> 01:21:09.767
Who knew that they stretched
to a width of some ten feet?"

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.333
What?

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:14.500
I felt their rancid breath 
 so close

01:21:14.533 --> 01:21:18.100
That I could reach out 
 and feel their filthy skin.

01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:22.200
"--and can talk
like a human being"?

01:21:23.433 --> 01:21:25.667
Hah!

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.200
"They have hooves.

01:21:28.233 --> 01:21:29.700
Do you remember
the sailor with the limp

01:21:29.733 --> 01:21:33.467
That we met
in the Port of London

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.200
And who told us
of an enormous squid?"

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.467
(Crying softly)

01:21:43.433 --> 01:21:44.600
Why are you blubbing?

01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:50.133
It's been so long since I last
received a letter from him.

01:21:50.167 --> 01:21:52.367
You're forgetting, my dear,
he's not worth your tears.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.400
Oh Daddy, please.

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.233
"Well here, we have a squid

01:22:00.267 --> 01:22:02.800
That is ten times as big,
has six eyes

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:05.800
And they call it Viy."

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:08.033
The fellow's obviously
lost his wits.

01:22:08.067 --> 01:22:12.800
"If I should not return,
search for me

01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:14.167
In this accursed place."

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:20.633
Please God,
let it be so, eh?

01:22:22.633 --> 01:22:25.333
(People walking
and talking overhead)

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.700
(Grunting)

01:23:01.667 --> 01:23:03.033
(Whispering)
Hey.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.433
Come on.

01:23:07.467 --> 01:23:08.767
Wake up.

01:23:10.067 --> 01:23:11.300
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:13.233
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.133
Um, uh--

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:20.333
You?

01:23:20.367 --> 01:23:23.400
I'll-- I'll take it off.

01:23:23.433 --> 01:23:24.800
It's all right.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.033
I'll take it off.

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.067
Shh, shh, shh.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.367
Here you go.

01:23:34.367 --> 01:23:36.033
There.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.300
The monster.

01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:40.600
The monster.

01:23:40.633 --> 01:23:43.500
You're feeding it,
aren't you? Hm?

01:23:46.367 --> 01:23:48.233
For how long?

01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:50.500
A whole year?

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.333
It's just maps.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.500
Papers than can just
disappear without a trace.

01:24:02.733 --> 01:24:04.533
Wait.

01:24:04.567 --> 01:24:06.567
I didn't make these marks.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.767
Look.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:12.267
So, your monster
can mark routes on maps.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.567
All of Sotnik's power
should come to me

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.733
Because you know my heart
is burning of it.

01:24:19.233 --> 01:24:20.533
(Paisiy's voice overhead)
Oh, I see. You want his money.

01:24:20.567 --> 01:24:21.800
Shh.

01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:23.400
It's power I need.

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:24.500
As for the money--

01:24:24.533 --> 01:24:26.400
It's for the church.

01:24:29.367 --> 01:24:31.300
OVERKO:
We have to finish off the girl
as soon as possible.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.467
She saw the whole thing.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.300
Listen to me.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:39.233
I want to conduct the execution
by the swamp.

01:24:39.267 --> 01:24:41.800
This way the whole village
will be responsible

01:24:41.833 --> 01:24:44.100
For spilling her blood.

01:24:44.133 --> 01:24:46.567
OVERKO:
Good thinking.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.200
PAISIY:
And she will be the bait

01:24:49.233 --> 01:24:50.600
To expose a certain kind

01:24:50.633 --> 01:24:53.667
Of monster.

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.067
I'd like to know who

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.667
Is under that skin.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700
Now go.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.267
(Door opening)

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.233
(Chuckling)

01:25:10.267 --> 01:25:13.100
All right, witch.

01:25:13.133 --> 01:25:14.767
(Grunting)

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.367
Panas!

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.200
Overko and Paisiy,

01:25:18.233 --> 01:25:19.233
There's a plot
to take over the--

01:25:19.267 --> 01:25:20.800
Ungh!

01:25:20.833 --> 01:25:22.533
You're coming with me!

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.333
Huaaah!

01:25:50.367 --> 01:25:51.500
Ungh!

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.167
Run, Nastusya.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.167
Run!

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.067
(Grunting)

01:26:04.233 --> 01:26:06.400
Why are you dressing up,
stupid cow?

01:26:06.433 --> 01:26:09.167
To see a young girl
put to death?

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.133
Come on, let's go.

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:12.667
Whoa there.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.067
Sit down.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:15.633
Such a bully.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.067
You witch.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.433
(People shouting)

01:26:24.533 --> 01:26:25.767
Drown the witch,
drown her!

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.233
Drown the witch!

01:26:35.733 --> 01:26:48.800
*

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.200
There.

01:26:50.233 --> 01:26:51.700
Good.

01:26:53.767 --> 01:26:55.133
Yavtuhk.

01:26:55.167 --> 01:26:56.233
Why are you here?

01:26:56.267 --> 01:26:57.667
I dare not speak of it.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.500
Tell me, what's wrong?

01:26:59.533 --> 01:27:03.300
Paisiy's sprinkled the witch
with holy water,

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:06.533
And she suddenly became crazy
like an animal with sharp claws.

01:27:06.567 --> 01:27:09.267
Then she turned into a crow
and tried to fly!

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.533
You're lying, huh?

01:27:10.567 --> 01:27:12.067
That's a good story.

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:14.300
I'm not that clever.

01:27:14.333 --> 01:27:15.300
But it's not true, right?

01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:17.133
(Screaming in distance)
See?

01:27:17.167 --> 01:27:19.267
There. Listen.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.200
Can you hear that?

01:27:21.233 --> 01:27:23.567
They say that when a witch
sinks into the water,

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.533
Well that's just the beginning.

01:27:26.567 --> 01:27:28.467
So why are you here?

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.367
Would you mind watching the
scientist while I go look?

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.267
Please, thank you.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.633
All right, I've got him.

01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:36.567
But I'm a busy man.
Understand that.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.067
I'll be quick!

01:27:45.533 --> 01:27:47.567
Don't just lay there.
Climb out.

01:27:53.533 --> 01:27:54.600
(Stuttering)

01:27:54.633 --> 01:27:55.667
Petru--
Don't!

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.067
He's joined the others.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.267
You should run.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.167
That fire's for you!

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.500
Go along the swamp.

01:28:02.533 --> 01:28:06.233
I've got your things
from the boat.

01:28:06.267 --> 01:28:07.500
You'll get wet,

01:28:07.533 --> 01:28:10.800
But it's better
than being burned alive.

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:12.033
Paisiy.

01:28:12.067 --> 01:28:13.333
Paisiy and Overko.

01:28:13.367 --> 01:28:14.500
If we don't stop them,

01:28:14.533 --> 01:28:15.700
A lot of villagers will die.

01:28:15.733 --> 01:28:17.100
They're fanatics.

01:28:17.133 --> 01:28:18.233
I understand.

01:28:18.267 --> 01:28:19.233
Be careful, Yavtukh!

01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:20.400
May God be with you.

01:28:20.433 --> 01:28:23.367
PAISIY:
This woman may be a witch.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.133
Let rightful punishment pass

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:29.333
Without stones
cast from our hands.

01:28:29.367 --> 01:28:31.067
It's very simple.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.200
If she floats,
she is a witch.

01:28:32.233 --> 01:28:34.300
There is no other way.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:48.200
*

01:28:48.233 --> 01:28:50.200
(Chopping)

01:28:56.567 --> 01:28:58.533
Brothers and sisters,

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:02.000
I call on you to cut this
disease out of our hearts.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.600
Everything is ready.

01:29:04.633 --> 01:29:05.700
I'm nearly finished.

01:29:05.733 --> 01:29:09.067
Petrus! Petrus!

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.300
Go away!

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:12.533
Let me die.

01:29:12.567 --> 01:29:13.767
Ungh!

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.067
No!

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.167
(Grunting)

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.167
I killed her.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.367
I killed my darling!

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.333
I killed her!

01:29:20.367 --> 01:29:22.033
It'd be best
if I just disappear.

01:29:22.067 --> 01:29:24.167
Petrus, what are you
talking about, "disappear"?

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.667
Khoma Brut disappeared,
you're disappeared.

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.067
I don't understand!

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.300
Gone in a second,

01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:29.300
Without even a trace!

01:29:29.333 --> 01:29:30.767
No, no, no.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.067
Where's the body?

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.433
Where's the grave, huh?

01:29:33.467 --> 01:29:35.067
There isn't.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.367
There isn't.
It doesn't exist!

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.533
Listen to me, stop.
Listen to me, Petrus.

01:29:38.567 --> 01:29:40.533
We've got one chance
to save this girl.

01:29:40.567 --> 01:29:42.233
One chance,
you understand me?

01:29:42.267 --> 01:29:44.067
I know what you saw
in the swamp.

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.500
What?

01:29:45.533 --> 01:29:47.700
You saw a sheep's head
with horns, no more.

01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:49.300
No monster.

01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:51.400
You-- you simple peasants,

01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:52.800
You create these monsters

01:29:52.833 --> 01:29:55.467
And then you scare yourselves
half to death!

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.233
Of course. It can only be--

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:59.033
Put on the sheep's skin.
Show yourself.

01:29:59.067 --> 01:30:00.533
They'll chase you!

01:30:02.233 --> 01:30:03.233
Lead everyone to the church.

01:30:03.267 --> 01:30:05.233
Bring them there!

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:19.267
I never thought I'd witness
such vicious stupidity.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:22.533
PAISIY:
I tell you,
we must strengthen our hearts.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.400
And prepare ourselves all

01:30:27.433 --> 01:30:29.033
To show no mercy.

01:30:29.067 --> 01:30:31.467
(Long, mournful horn)

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.433
WOMAN:
That's Viy!

01:30:36.467 --> 01:30:37.433
(Gunshot)

01:30:37.467 --> 01:30:38.700
(Squawking)

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:39.700
Oh!

01:30:39.733 --> 01:30:41.033
I shout Viy!

01:30:41.067 --> 01:30:42.067
Doesn't look
like Viy.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.167
I shot Viy! I shot Viy!

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.467
(People shouting)

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.400
Stop!

01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:49.433
No, stop!

01:30:49.467 --> 01:30:50.800
First we must kill the witch!

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.767
Stop!

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.467
Bring him to me.

01:30:58.467 --> 01:30:59.600
(People shouting)

01:30:59.633 --> 01:31:02.167
WOMAN:
Don't let him get away!

01:31:15.633 --> 01:31:17.567
(Loon calling)

01:31:20.133 --> 01:31:22.100
WOMAN:
That's Viy!

01:31:22.133 --> 01:31:30.433
*

01:31:30.467 --> 01:31:32.533
(Squawking)

01:31:39.533 --> 01:31:41.700
(Grunting)

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:23.433
*

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:39.400
*

01:32:39.433 --> 01:32:43.200
(Whimpering)

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.533
Looking for these? Huh?

01:33:04.733 --> 01:33:06.067
Oogh!

01:33:08.533 --> 01:33:11.167
Aagh!

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.300
Khoma Brutus.

01:33:17.667 --> 01:33:19.467
You tried to kill me,
didn't you?

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:20.667
Up there on the dome.

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.500
Didn't you?!

01:33:22.533 --> 01:33:24.200
Steal my work,

01:33:24.233 --> 01:33:25.633
And escape any punishment.

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:27.200
You want facts.

01:33:27.233 --> 01:33:29.167
I'll give you facts.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.467
(Grunting)

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.267
You liked Sotnik's daughter.

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.033
You liked her a lot,

01:33:34.067 --> 01:33:36.167
But when you realized
she was out of your league,

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.400
You attacked the poor girl,

01:33:37.433 --> 01:33:39.767
Raped her,
and left her for dead.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.267
(Gunshot)

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.267
As she lay there dying,

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.367
She hoped that her attacker,
being forced to pray

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.733
Over her dead body for
three days and three nights,

01:33:48.767 --> 01:33:51.367
Would repent and confess.

01:33:53.167 --> 01:33:55.667
But not you.

01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.133
"He knows who wears
the sheep's."

01:33:58.167 --> 01:34:00.767
Those were the last
words she said.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.733
"Sheep's skin"
is what she meant to say.

01:34:02.767 --> 01:34:06.033
And you.

01:34:06.067 --> 01:34:08.167
You terrorized the village
for a whole year

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.100
And right now, as we speak

01:34:10.133 --> 01:34:11.467
Another innocent girl
will be murdered

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.467
Because of you!

01:34:17.367 --> 01:34:18.767
Well I won't let it happen.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.267
Your secret will be revealed
once and for all.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.533
What do you want from me?

01:34:22.567 --> 01:34:24.600
Get up!

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:27.367
You won't believe me.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.200
Ah, tired.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.367
JONATHAN:
Where'd you get that?

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.633
Where did you get that belt?

01:34:35.667 --> 01:34:37.400
(Grunting)

01:34:37.433 --> 01:34:39.767
You won't believe me.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.267
Where did you get it?!

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.667
I got it when it snapped
off your map case,

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:46.167
As I hauled you
out of the swamp.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.733
Lies.

01:34:47.767 --> 01:34:50.267
KHOMA:
I told you
you wouldn't believe me.

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.467
So what about this?

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.700
Why did you steal my maps?

01:34:53.733 --> 01:34:56.033
It was my only chance
of survival.

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.133
(Wood breaking)

01:35:01.167 --> 01:35:03.200
(Creaking)

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:07.167
Agh!

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:08.333
Aahh!

01:35:08.367 --> 01:35:12.267
With your map I
could get away.

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.633
Where else would I go?

01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:16.667
To the seminary,
so everyone could ridicule me?

01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.767
Accuse me of crimes
I didn't commit,

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.367
Like killing Pannochka?

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.733
Look! It's the Devil!

01:35:20.767 --> 01:35:22.600
Boys, it's me, Khoma.

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:25.400
Don't run away!

01:35:25.433 --> 01:35:26.700
So, it was you who set
Overko and Dorosh

01:35:26.733 --> 01:35:30.033
At each other's throats.

01:35:30.067 --> 01:35:31.567
They were too greedy.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.533
Wait.
Help me understand.

01:35:33.567 --> 01:35:35.800
Why did Pannochka want you
to pray over her body?

01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:37.200
Why?

01:35:40.267 --> 01:35:42.700
A year ago,
me, Gorobets and Khalyava

01:35:42.733 --> 01:35:46.700
Completely lost our way,

01:35:46.733 --> 01:35:49.567
And found ourselves staying
at the water mill by the swamp.

01:35:52.533 --> 01:35:54.600
That is my wreath you found.

01:35:54.633 --> 01:35:56.233
What's your name?

01:35:56.267 --> 01:35:58.033
I'm Khoma.

01:35:58.067 --> 01:35:59.633
Philosophy.

01:35:59.667 --> 01:36:03.100
No uh--
I'm a student of philosophy

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:04.700
From the seminary.

01:36:04.733 --> 01:36:08.533
You may be a Christian student
from the seminary...

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.500
...but we too have our powerful
ancient traditions.

01:36:13.533 --> 01:36:14.700
(Chuckling)

01:36:14.733 --> 01:36:18.167
I have decided...

01:36:20.467 --> 01:36:24.100
I will take you my destiny.

01:36:24.133 --> 01:36:27.433
And you're supposed
to love me truly forever.

01:36:34.133 --> 01:36:35.367
Pannochka!

01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:45.633
*

01:36:45.667 --> 01:36:46.800
Pannochka!

01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:49.267
(Screaming)

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.300
In fear I put
on the sheep's skin.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:58.500
I was sure Nastusya
would think

01:36:58.533 --> 01:37:01.400
I was the one
who attacked Pannochka.

01:37:01.433 --> 01:37:04.100
(Long, mournful foghorn drone)

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.433
In gratitude for saving her,

01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:10.500
She fed that monster
for over a year,

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:13.467
And I've been praying for
Pannochka's soul ever since.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.433
Only the first three nights 
were terrible.

01:37:15.467 --> 01:37:19.733
When the third night was over,
I was paralyzed from fear,

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:23.267
From what I had endured
in the church.

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:25.200
It was then at daybreak

01:37:25.233 --> 01:37:27.067
That he came.

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.500
I've heard enough
about Viy.

01:37:28.533 --> 01:37:31.233
No. He's more terrifying.

01:37:31.267 --> 01:37:32.433
Who?

01:37:32.467 --> 01:37:33.533
Who was it?

01:37:33.567 --> 01:37:35.433
It's him!

01:37:35.467 --> 01:37:37.567
(Grunting)

01:37:43.233 --> 01:37:45.033
Just lure the villagers away,

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.767
And she'll be fine.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.467
I'm coming, Nastusya.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.133
(Dog barking)

01:37:52.167 --> 01:37:53.333
(Gun cocking)

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.567
Well, monster.

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.467
Look who's playing games.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.633
(Birds squawking)

01:37:59.667 --> 01:38:01.733
Well, Khoma.

01:38:01.767 --> 01:38:05.200
You never saw it coming,
did you?

01:38:05.233 --> 01:38:06.700
You like it there
with that dead flesh?

01:38:06.733 --> 01:38:08.600
If you'd have died,

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:10.700
All of this would have been
much simpler!

01:38:10.733 --> 01:38:12.533
(Wood creaking)

01:38:12.567 --> 01:38:13.533
(Panting)

01:38:13.567 --> 01:38:15.033
I don't know how,

01:38:15.067 --> 01:38:16.433
But you survived.

01:38:18.633 --> 01:38:22.267
I only meant to scare her
with the disguise.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.267
Oh, how she tempted me.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:26.300
That's why I put on the skin.

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:28.700
She seduced me, too.

01:38:28.733 --> 01:38:31.200
How she moaned,

01:38:31.233 --> 01:38:33.067
And how the fire raged

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.033
In her black, devilish eyes.

01:38:35.067 --> 01:38:38.367
It wasn't I who sinned.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.167
She was the temptress!

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.733
It's the tempter who sins,

01:38:41.767 --> 01:38:44.667
Not the one who is tempted!

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.767
(Whispering)
Somebody help me.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.267
Huuagh!

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.633
(Creaking)

01:38:49.667 --> 01:39:04.567
*

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.467
(Wood creaking)

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.333
Don't bother shouting out.

01:39:08.367 --> 01:39:12.733
No one will hear you.

01:39:12.767 --> 01:39:15.600
And if they do,

01:39:15.633 --> 01:39:19.067
They're too superstitious
to come up here.

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.600
Where have you hidden
my gold coins?

01:39:20.633 --> 01:39:21.800
Nastusya needs me.

01:39:21.833 --> 01:39:25.167
YAVTUKH:
Let him go.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.567
Or your head will say goodbye
to your shoulders.

01:39:28.733 --> 01:39:30.133
Petrus, run.

01:39:30.167 --> 01:39:32.300
Save her now!

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:38.167
You want a miracle?

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.467
No problem.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.700
I make miracles all the time.

01:39:41.733 --> 01:39:44.367
For many years
I travelled Europe,

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.300
And I learned what was needed
to start a new religion.

01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:50.133
Then scientists like you

01:39:50.167 --> 01:39:53.133
Created tools to help
men like me take charge.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.467
I am the new Messiah!

01:40:01.367 --> 01:40:03.400
Now die.

01:40:03.433 --> 01:40:05.500
What?

01:40:05.533 --> 01:40:07.200
As a priest,

01:40:07.233 --> 01:40:10.667
I should give you
a chance to repent.

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.467
Read a prayer for the dying.

01:40:17.367 --> 01:40:22.167
"Our Father, who art in Heaven."

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.200
"Our Father,
who art in Heaven,

01:40:24.233 --> 01:40:25.500
Hallowed be thy name."

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.700
PETRUS:
Nastusya!

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:34.500
(Gasping)

01:40:34.533 --> 01:40:37.567
(Angelic singing)

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.467
Nastusya!

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.733
(Splashing)

01:40:41.767 --> 01:40:43.733
(Singing continues)

01:40:48.433 --> 01:40:50.567
Nastusya!

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.667
I want you to understand,
Scientist,

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:58.567
That your life isn't
in the hands

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.100
Of our Lord above, no.

01:41:00.133 --> 01:41:01.500
Your life is in my hands.

01:41:01.533 --> 01:41:06.233
I am the one who decides
who lives

01:41:06.267 --> 01:41:08.167
And who dies!

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200
A curse upon you!

01:41:09.233 --> 01:41:11.733
(Bell tolling)

01:41:17.067 --> 01:41:19.267
You go back
to your business, please.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:24.067
Well, young Daniel.

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:27.267
I have a confession.

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.400
I'm ashamed to say,

01:41:29.433 --> 01:41:31.333
That I severely misjudged
your father.

01:41:33.467 --> 01:41:35.167
Mmm.

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.600
Believe me,

01:41:36.633 --> 01:41:39.600
And you will be proud of him.

01:41:39.633 --> 01:41:43.167
These are his letters
to your mother.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.633
Hm?

01:41:47.667 --> 01:41:50.633
Which I intend to publish

01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:55.200
So that the world will see
how wrong it is

01:41:55.233 --> 01:41:57.700
To judge a man as rashly
as I did.

01:42:01.667 --> 01:42:04.767
They burned poor Bruno
at the stake,

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.100
When he said
the world was round.

01:42:08.133 --> 01:42:09.333
(Baby cooing)

01:42:09.367 --> 01:42:11.533
Hm?

01:42:15.133 --> 01:42:17.133
Now,

01:42:17.167 --> 01:42:19.533
You hang on to these.

01:42:19.567 --> 01:42:20.533
Mm-hm.

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:22.200
(Fluttering)

01:42:22.233 --> 01:42:23.200
(Gasping)

01:42:23.233 --> 01:42:24.467
Jonathan.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.600
There's another pigeon.

01:42:28.267 --> 01:42:31.367
Now, we're going to see
how the story ends.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.533
(Birds squawking)

01:42:33.567 --> 01:42:35.467
Where are you going?
Up there!

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.067
Aren't you afraid?

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.667
A real Cossack 
doesn't fear anything.

01:42:45.433 --> 01:42:47.733
Let's get this guy.

01:42:47.767 --> 01:42:50.600
PAISIY:
I'm the one who decides

01:42:50.633 --> 01:42:52.200
Who lives and who dies.

01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:55.167
You might as well
be shouting "fire!"

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.233
From the watchtower.

01:42:57.267 --> 01:42:58.700
The whole neighbourhood
can hear you.

01:42:58.733 --> 01:43:02.267
(Battering door)

01:43:04.533 --> 01:43:05.800
A curse upon you!

01:43:05.833 --> 01:43:07.233
(Wood moaning)

01:43:07.267 --> 01:43:09.167
Aaahh!

01:43:14.333 --> 01:43:17.500
(Wood creaking)

01:43:17.533 --> 01:43:32.333
*

01:43:33.467 --> 01:43:37.200
(Gasping for breath)

01:43:41.667 --> 01:43:44.000
Papa!

01:43:48.333 --> 01:43:50.633
(Staggered breathing)

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.767
LORD DADLI READING: 
 "A miracle has happened.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.367
(Door opening)

01:44:04.667 --> 01:44:08.067
I feel the breath of God.

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.567
His touch,
which has changed my fate.

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.700
Never before have I felt
anything like this.

01:44:15.733 --> 01:44:18.633
All my life passed
before my eyes,

01:44:18.667 --> 01:44:22.600
And I thought,

01:44:22.633 --> 01:44:26.533
What will I leave
after I depart this world?

01:44:26.567 --> 01:44:28.700
My dear, I want us
to have a child."

01:44:28.733 --> 01:44:31.633
(Chuckling)

01:44:31.667 --> 01:44:33.700
There you are.

01:44:33.733 --> 01:44:36.200
Your master and I
were such good friends.

01:44:36.233 --> 01:44:37.200
(Whinnying)

01:44:37.233 --> 01:44:38.367
Quiet!

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.300
(Whinnying)

01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:41.300
Ogh!

01:44:41.333 --> 01:44:44.067
"Evil was punished.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.667
I received a worthy payment."

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:46.700
Look!
There's Sotnik's money!

01:44:46.733 --> 01:44:48.200
Ha-ha-ha!

01:44:48.233 --> 01:44:50.567
Well is it enough
for you now, Overko?

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.567
It's my money! Mine!

01:44:59.733 --> 01:45:01.767
Petrus, help me pack.

01:45:05.633 --> 01:45:09.267
*

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.600
LORD DADLI: 
 "The body and soul of Pannochka 
 are now both at peace,

01:45:12.633 --> 01:45:16.633
And her father's spirit 
 is at ease.

01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:18.633
And Khoma,

01:45:18.667 --> 01:45:21.433
I am probably similar 
 to this seminary student

01:45:21.467 --> 01:45:22.800
With our scientific 
 scepticism."

01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:25.267
What is it?
Come on, move.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:28.333
"Fortune chose me especially 
 for this godforsaken place.

01:45:28.367 --> 01:45:30.667
To finish the story that 
 started with him."

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:34.100
Out of my way.

01:45:34.133 --> 01:45:35.400
Told you.

01:45:35.433 --> 01:45:38.100
It's definitely magic.

01:45:38.133 --> 01:45:39.367
GIRL:
Science and magic?

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.800
Move.

01:45:41.833 --> 01:45:44.533
Let me through!

01:45:44.567 --> 01:45:47.100
What is that?

01:45:47.133 --> 01:45:48.733
(Children murmuring)

01:45:48.767 --> 01:45:50.767
GIRL:
I wanna see!

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.033
JONATHAN:
Where's the steam, Taras?

01:45:53.067 --> 01:45:54.233
That's it.

01:45:54.267 --> 01:45:56.100
BOY:
Oh, oh!

01:46:04.767 --> 01:46:07.633
It's amazing that
the geniuses of mankind

01:46:07.667 --> 01:46:09.167
Can either destroy or create,

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.367
Depending on who they follow.

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.167
We'll have moving images

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.667
That'll bring far away cities
and people to us all.

01:46:16.133 --> 01:46:17.333
GIRL:
It's magic!

01:46:19.167 --> 01:46:20.600
It's moving!

01:46:20.633 --> 01:46:22.600
JONATHAN:
 Now that my fear is vanquished

01:46:22.633 --> 01:46:24.100
And my cold, scientific mind

01:46:24.133 --> 01:46:26.067
Can again analyze my feelings,

01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:29.400
I can confirm that 
 all of the fantastic events

01:46:29.433 --> 01:46:32.100
Of the last days 
 are nothing more than a figment

01:46:32.133 --> 01:46:34.700
Of people's collective 
 imagination-

01:46:34.733 --> 01:46:39.500
Something which is still little 
 studied by modern science.

01:46:44.767 --> 01:46:46.767
(Shrieking)

01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:11.533
*

01:47:19.267 --> 01:47:21.667
Look deeply in my eyes

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:24.633
As you burn for eternity.

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:48.333
*

01:47:59.433 --> 01:48:14.367
