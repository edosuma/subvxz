00:03.370 --> 00:06.770
Well, that was just lovely.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.990
I do aim to please.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.210
And, after last time,
I appreciate the aiming.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.270
Hey, we made good time.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.280
I can let the babysitter go early.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.450
The key is efficient foreplay.

00:19.460 --> 00:22.080
Minimal attention to each breast

00:22.090 --> 00:24.630
before I meander to your dander.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.180
Spoon?

00:28.190 --> 00:29.010
Sure.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.950
And... switch.

00:45.450 --> 00:46.710
That was fun.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.350
It always is.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.390
Okay, well, drive safe.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.440
I always do.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.580
I know. I'm just a worrier.

00:52.590 --> 00:53.680
I know you are.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.090
-Bye-e.
-Bye-bye.

00:59.710 --> 01:02.480
I get more tongue from my butcher.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.100
I'm sorry.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.010
Did you consider making
your presence known?

01:11.020 --> 01:13.010
Clear your throat,
maybe a little cough?

01:13.020 --> 01:15.960
I wanted to vomit, but I was afraid
it might break the mood.

01:16.490 --> 01:20.160
Hey, hey, postcoital kissing
is always more platonic.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.160
Is it?

01:21.170 --> 01:22.660
Yes. Because, well,

01:22.670 --> 01:24.300
we both know
where our mouths have been.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.880
I see.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.050
But, in the bedroom,

01:27.060 --> 01:28.870
there was a lot of saliva

01:28.880 --> 01:30.930
and heat and friction,
believe you me.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.950
Really?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.290
Yes, really.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.450
Okay, it may not have been
crazy hot monkey sex

01:40.460 --> 01:42.040
like when we first started dating,

01:42.050 --> 01:46.630
but it was very much
in the general category of jungle humping.

01:47.130 --> 01:48.760
Jungle humping?

01:48.770 --> 01:51.710
Yes. Maybe not,
you know, tree swinging,

01:51.720 --> 01:55.310
but certainly canoodling
on some low-hanging branches.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.450
You poor bastard.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.680
Don't you dare feel sorry for me!

01:59.690 --> 02:01.550
This is what an adult relationship

02:01.560 --> 02:02.640
looks like, Charlie.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.110
People get comfortable with each other,

02:04.120 --> 02:05.290
and they develop a routine.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.530
And, if it's not always fireworks
and explosions,

02:07.540 --> 02:08.990
well, that's a reasonable trade

02:09.000 --> 02:11.850
for a warm,collegial partnership.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.440
You poor, poor bastard.

02:16.810 --> 02:18.900
This conversation is over.

02:18.910 --> 02:20.990
If only.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.470
Okay, it's boring!
It's suffocating!It's a deathwatch!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.800
But what choice do I have, Charlie?

02:27.810 --> 02:29.360
Pretend I'm you? I'm not you.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.580
I'm a monogamous,
settle-down kind of guy

02:31.590 --> 02:33.080
who hangs on to a relationship

02:33.090 --> 02:34.130
until I'm looking at divorce papers

02:34.140 --> 02:36.030
or the pointy end of a steak knife.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.110
Oh, that's a load of crap.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.840
You're just afraid,
if you let go of one of these broads,

02:39.850 --> 02:41.610
you're never going to get laid again.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.840
Didn't I just say that?!

Two And A Half Men - 5x11.
- Meander To Your Dander -

02:54.540 --> 02:56.850
Boxing sucks.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.590
As always, you're entitled
to your stupid opinion.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.480
Why are you making it personal?

03:04.490 --> 03:06.020
I didn't make it personal.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.640
In Ultimate Fighting,
they kick, they elbow,

03:09.650 --> 03:11.960
they get a guy down
and smash his head on the floor.

03:11.970 --> 03:15.100
These guys just dance around
and barely hit each other.

03:15.110 --> 03:17.280
Okay, okay, listen to me.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.360
Boxing is a science.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.280
Boxers don't just wail on each other.

03:21.290 --> 03:24.100
They strategize, feel each other out,
wait for an opening.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.500
Gay.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.340
What's with the little pillows
on their hands?

03:33.350 --> 03:35.670
Even if they hit each other,
it wouldn't hurt.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.970
Oh, does that hurt?

03:41.980 --> 03:42.890
Yeah.

03:42.900 --> 03:43.630
Good.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.620
Hey, what are you doing?

03:46.630 --> 03:47.720
Uncle Charlie hit me.

03:47.730 --> 03:48.640
Good.

03:50.140 --> 03:51.670
Where have you been?

03:51.680 --> 03:53.160
I'll... I'll tell you later.

03:53.170 --> 03:55.200
Tell him now.
I got better things to do.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.920
You promised he'd grow on me.

03:59.930 --> 04:01.790
I lied.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.090
So where were you?

04:05.100 --> 04:06.590
Well, I thought
about what you said,

04:06.600 --> 04:09.390
and I went over to Donna's house
to break up with her.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.520
I'm proud of you.

04:11.530 --> 04:12.670
Thanks.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.800
I'm going to meet
her parents next weekend.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.230
But you just said...

04:18.240 --> 04:19.560
I know what I said, but I just...

04:19.570 --> 04:20.589
I couldn't do it.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.420
I'm not capable
of rejecting another human being.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.270
Wow. I'd think,after all these years,

04:25.280 --> 04:26.690
you'd want to get even.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.550
I am in trouble here, Charlie.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.550
How do I get out of a stagnant,
joyless relationship?

04:33.560 --> 04:36.180
If I knew how to do that,
you wouldn't still be living here.

04:40.810 --> 04:42.950
Okay, first...

04:43.550 --> 04:46.220
You gotta get your mind right.

04:46.230 --> 04:47.230
How do I do that?

04:47.590 --> 04:51.490
Close your eyes,
and imagine a parallel world

04:51.500 --> 04:54.400
where there's an Alan Harper
exactly like you.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.860
Except he's got a set of balls.

05:02.070 --> 05:04.160
You want to help me here or not?

05:04.170 --> 05:06.160
It's gotta be fun for me, too.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.740
Fine. We'll just assume
that your mind is right.

05:12.190 --> 05:13.740
Now,

05:13.750 --> 05:15.830
before you do the actual dumping,

05:15.840 --> 05:17.640
there's a few things you've got
to consider.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.790
Like what?

05:19.020 --> 05:21.720
Well, does she have
any embarrassing photographs of you

05:21.730 --> 05:24.130
that can wind up on the Internet
if she takes it badly?

05:24.140 --> 05:25.580
I'm not sure.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.850
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

05:27.860 --> 05:29.350
Well, there's one of me naked,

05:29.360 --> 05:30.950
but I'm wearing a mask and a cape.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.300
I thought the sex was mundane.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.000
Sadly, it still was.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.520
Whatever, she can't use the picture.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.550
Does she have any
of your credit card information?

05:40.560 --> 05:41.370
No.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.020
Don't answer so quickly.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.740
I once handed a date my Visa
so she could pump gas for me,

05:47.430 --> 05:49.560
and, in my next statement,
there were charges

05:49.570 --> 05:51.760
for a boob job and a Playstation 3.

05:52.730 --> 05:55.590
And I never got
to play with either one of them.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.060
You made your date pump gas?

06:00.070 --> 06:02.290
I liked the song
that was on the radio.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.550
But back to the topic at hand.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.330
Does she own any chick weapons?

06:07.340 --> 06:08.600
Chick weapons?

06:08.610 --> 06:09.830
You know.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.870
Little guns, Tasers, pepper spray?

06:11.880 --> 06:14.690
Well, there's a baseball bat
by her front door,

06:14.700 --> 06:16.650
but I think that's for intruders.

06:16.660 --> 06:19.380
Yeah,I've made that mistake,too.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.460
Okay.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.860
Let's talk about the where,when and how.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.050
Where.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.830
Always break up in a public place.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.060
That way,you avoid having a scene.

06:31.070 --> 06:31.880
That makes sense.

06:31.890 --> 06:32.760
When.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.760
Before the dessert menu comes out.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.580
Otherwise, you can find yourself
with a lap full of hot coffee,

06:37.590 --> 06:38.850
which is not as much fun
as it sounds.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.900
That doesn't sound fun.

06:40.910 --> 06:45.540
It sounds fun if you're wearing
a couple of doughnuts.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.530
Moving on to how.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.920
What you want to convey

06:53.930 --> 06:56.020
is your undying affection and gratitude

06:56.030 --> 06:57.530
for your time spent together,

06:57.540 --> 07:00.950
coupled with your need
for space to find out who you really are.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.030
But that's a load of crap.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.170
It's all crap, Alan.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.200
You know it, she knows it,
everybody knows it.

07:05.210 --> 07:06.800
All we're trying to do here

07:06.810 --> 07:09.580
is keep her from taking
batting practice on your kidneys.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.340
Why would she go for my kidneys?

07:11.350 --> 07:13.940
Because you'll be running away
covering your head.

07:13.950 --> 07:17.380
Okay, okay. So...
so I take her to dinner and,

07:17.390 --> 07:19.650
then before the coffee comes,
I tell her that,

07:19.660 --> 07:21.650
while I still have
strong feelings for her,

07:21.660 --> 07:24.020
I need time to find out
who I really am.

07:24.030 --> 07:24.930
Excellent.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.520
Yeah. Maybe...
maybe I can throw in some stuff

07:26.530 --> 07:29.030
about how I'm still reeling
from my divorce.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.480
Don't improvise.
You don't have the chops for it.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.840
Sorry.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.850
No problem.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.480
I do appreciate the advice.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.130
You're very welcome.

07:46.210 --> 07:49.390
A mask and a cape,
and the sex was boring?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.010
What can I say?

07:51.020 --> 07:52.530
She still knew it was me.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.350
How do I look?

08:02.020 --> 08:03.710
What difference does it make?

08:03.720 --> 08:04.860
You're breaking up with her.

08:04.870 --> 08:07.190
I don't want my clothes to say,
"Come hither."

08:07.550 --> 08:09.950
Don't worry. As always, they say,

08:09.960 --> 08:12.090
"Your regular teacher is sick."

08:14.270 --> 08:16.170
You clear on everything I told you?

08:16.180 --> 08:17.810
Yes, yes.
I'm going to go to her house,

08:17.820 --> 08:19.450
pick her up,
take her to the restaurant...

08:21.270 --> 08:22.720
Pick her up?

08:22.730 --> 08:23.990
You're supposed to meet her there.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.950
Why?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.460
What do you mean,why?

08:26.470 --> 08:28.780
You're gonna breakup with her,
then drive her home?

08:29.770 --> 08:32.980
You'll need the Jaws of Life
to get her out of your car.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.610
You didn't say anything about that.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.559
It's common sense.

08:36.570 --> 08:38.799
You know why Custer and Sitting Bull

08:38.809 --> 08:40.900
didn't share a pony
to Little Big Horn?

08:40.909 --> 08:42.620
Because they knew there were

08:42.630 --> 08:43.830
going to be some hurt feelings,

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
and the ride home would be awkward.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.120
You know what?

08:47.130 --> 08:47.679
I'm just going tocall her
and reschedule.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.910
No, no, no, you're not.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.310
Here's what you're going to do.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.840
You're going to pick her up,

08:52.850 --> 08:53.780
you're going to have a nice dinner,

08:53.790 --> 08:54.830
you're going to drive her home

08:54.840 --> 08:56.280
and walk her to her door.

08:56.290 --> 08:57.420
What if she asks me in?

08:57.430 --> 08:59.610
No. Never go inside.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.250
Everything in her house is a potential weapon.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.470
Everything?

09:04.480 --> 09:08.030
I was once blinded
for two days by potpourri.

09:09.660 --> 09:14.420
So, you just walk her to her door,

09:14.430 --> 09:16.640
take her by the hand,

09:16.650 --> 09:19.540
and tell her
that you've had wonderful times together,

09:19.550 --> 09:21.860
An M and those are the memories
you will always cherish.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.540
You know,
we did have wonderful times.

09:24.550 --> 09:28.410
Hiking in Catalina,
go karting in Oxnard,

09:28.950 --> 09:31.400
Oktoberfest in Rosemead.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.620
Oh, what a day that was!

09:34.630 --> 09:36.350
Sharing bratwurst and sauerkraut

09:36.360 --> 09:38.730
while listening to the battle
of the oompah bands.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.780
Oh, God! Do you think
I'm making a mistake?

09:41.790 --> 09:44.510
No, no, no, no, no, no.
The mind plays tricks on us.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.420
It only remembers the good times.

09:46.430 --> 09:49.920
Or, in your case, the creepy,
pathetic times.

09:49.930 --> 09:51.590
Don't worry, Alan.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.280
There'll be other broads
to share your bratwurst with.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.000
You're right. I have to do this.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.850
Wait, wait. What...

10:01.860 --> 10:03.440
What if she starts crying?

10:03.450 --> 10:04.940
You hold her in your arms,

10:04.950 --> 10:07.400
whisper that this is best
for both of you,

10:07.410 --> 10:10.320
then turn around
and walk away like a man.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.940
Unless

10:11.950 --> 10:13.670
you hear a distinct metallic click.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.960
Then zigzag and roll.

10:27.130 --> 10:29.760
Hi. Come on in.

10:29.770 --> 10:31.720
Uh... uh... That's okay.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.710
I'm kind of hungry.
Let's just go.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.790
Well, actually,
I thought we could stay in tonight.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.930
Really?

10:37.940 --> 10:39.850
I'm making fondue. Come on.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.820
Oh, goody.

10:41.830 --> 10:45.130
Hot cheese and long, sharp forks.

11:02.980 --> 11:05.850
This movie is stupid.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.780
This movie is a classic.

11:09.790 --> 11:12.880
It's been 40 minutes,
and we haven't even seen the shark yet.

11:13.110 --> 11:15.690
That's because they're building suspense.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.740
Letting you use your imagination.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.330
You know what I'm imagining?

11:19.340 --> 11:21.160
A better movie.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.620
It's a classic, Jake.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.170
I'll tell you what's a classic.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.090
Snakes on a Plane.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.940
'Cause first of all,
you're in an airplane

11:28.950 --> 11:30.180
which is scary to begin with,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.350
and then it's all filled
with snakes.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.120
And they're everywhere.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.040
They're in the overhead compartments,

11:36.050 --> 11:38.200
they're in the bathrooms,
they're in the vomit bags.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.840
You need to throw up,
open the bag-- snake!

11:42.060 --> 11:44.240
Sounds gripping.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.290
Snake!

11:52.680 --> 11:54.540
Snake!

11:56.260 --> 11:58.570
That's it, we're out of here.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.750
Where are we going?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.890
Someplace public where killing you
would get me in trouble.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.700
Fine.

12:04.710 --> 12:06.200
Snake!

12:08.000 --> 12:09.620
Great fondue, Donna.

12:09.630 --> 12:10.670
Glad you liked it.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.900
Oh, don't forget
to put away the little forks.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.760
Thanks.

12:14.770 --> 12:15.950
Be right back.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.900
Oh, good Lord.

12:28.570 --> 12:31.100
We've had wonderful times together,
Donna.

12:31.110 --> 12:33.830
And those are memories
I will always cherish.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.770
What?

12:34.780 --> 12:35.720
Nothing.

12:38.050 --> 12:41.500
Uh-oh, potpourri.

12:54.260 --> 12:56.210
I made coffee.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.320
Hot coffee?

12:57.330 --> 12:58.870
Well, yeah.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.520
Of course it's hot.

13:02.430 --> 13:04.370
Oh, oh, my.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.110
That is potentially scalding.

13:06.340 --> 13:08.330
Blow on it, silly.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.380
Yes. Blowing.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.210
You blow, too.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.100
So, uh, so, listen,Donna, um,

13:17.110 --> 13:18.870
there's something we really need
to talk about.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.830
What's that?

13:19.970 --> 13:22.190
Well, I was wondering...

13:22.200 --> 13:26.810
Ar-Ar-Are you completely happy
in this relationship?

13:26.820 --> 13:27.900
Oh, good.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.300
Then it's not just me.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.450
What do you mean?

13:30.460 --> 13:32.720
Well, I enjoy spending time

13:32.730 --> 13:34.990
with you, but, honey,
I kind of feel like

13:35.000 --> 13:36.630
we're getting a little stale.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.260
Really? I thought it was going great.

13:38.270 --> 13:40.070
Come on, Alan.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.980
Our sex life is pathetic.

13:41.990 --> 13:44.160
We're just going through the motions.

13:44.170 --> 13:45.100
Well, now, now, hold on.

13:45.110 --> 13:47.230
Those, uh,
those motions are tried and true.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.730
Call it whatever you want--

13:48.740 --> 13:50.780
tried and true, dull and listless...

13:50.790 --> 13:52.560
I want to call it tried and true.

13:52.570 --> 13:56.640
All I know is, every time
we get in bed, it's the same old thing.

13:56.650 --> 13:57.590
The same old thing?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.640
What about the mask and cape?

13:59.650 --> 14:02.640
It was the same old thing
in a mask and cape!

14:02.780 --> 14:04.960
Please don't take it personally.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.320
Oh, no, no, how can I possibly
take it personally?

14:07.330 --> 14:08.960
You're just telling me
I'm a lousy lay.

14:08.970 --> 14:10.320
I didn't mean lousy.

14:10.330 --> 14:14.680
I meant uninspired,
lackluster, predictable...

14:14.690 --> 14:15.560
Okay.

14:15.570 --> 14:18.820
Tedious, mind-numbing, boring...

14:18.830 --> 14:19.710
All right, all right,
all right, that's it.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.040
Come upstairs with me.

14:21.050 --> 14:23.140
I will show you tedious,
mind-numbing and boring!

14:24.140 --> 14:26.040
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

14:26.050 --> 14:26.980
Hot! Hot!Hot! Hot!

14:26.990 --> 14:27.710
What can I do?!

14:27.720 --> 14:29.540
I don't know! Just do something!

14:40.370 --> 14:42.600
How can you say this is boring?

14:45.110 --> 14:46.180
Wait till you try this.

14:46.190 --> 14:47.880
This is the best pizza in town.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.290
Says who?

14:49.340 --> 14:50.540
They put a flier
on my mom's windshield.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.560
It said "Best pizza in town."

14:52.570 --> 14:55.390
Jake, let me give you
a little culinary advice.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.630
Any restaurant
that advertises on windshields

14:57.640 --> 14:59.690
and has a guy standing out
front dressed as a hoagie

14:59.700 --> 15:01.830
is probably not the best in town.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.870
He wasn't a hoagie,
he was a calzone.

15:11.350 --> 15:12.840
Amazing.

15:12.850 --> 15:13.620
What?

15:13.630 --> 15:14.190
How can a kid

15:14.200 --> 15:16.380
with such lousy taste
in pizza and movies

15:16.390 --> 15:18.210
have such good taste in girls?

15:19.430 --> 15:21.480
She is kind of cute.

15:21.490 --> 15:22.790
Why don't you go talk to her?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.150
I don't know what to say.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.520
That's never stopped you
from running your mouth before.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.180
What about her mom?

15:30.190 --> 15:32.080
Just stick with the daughter for now.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.320
No, I mean...

15:33.330 --> 15:34.330
I know what you mean.

15:34.340 --> 15:37.370
Tell you what,
I'll be your wingman.

15:37.380 --> 15:39.820
I'll go over and engage
the mom in conversation.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.350
Then after I've greased the wheels,

15:41.360 --> 15:42.630
I'll give you a signal,

15:42.640 --> 15:44.720
you saunter over
and work your magic.

15:44.730 --> 15:45.760
Saunter?

15:45.770 --> 15:46.870
Walk.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.400
Then just say walk.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.100
You don't have to make up words.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.560
Wait. What signal?

15:54.820 --> 15:57.030
I don't know,
I'll give you a thumbs up.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.580
That's not much of a signal.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.820
How about I just wave my arms
and say, "Yo, dumb ass"?

16:02.050 --> 16:04.100
Let's go with the thumb.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.020
Excuse me.  Yes?

16:12.030 --> 16:13.970
I'm, I'm,
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner,

16:13.980 --> 16:16.520
but I'm sitting over there
with my nephew...  Now?!

16:16.530 --> 16:18.030
No, not now.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.750
Dumb ass.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.000
Now?!

16:21.140 --> 16:23.460
No!

16:23.770 --> 16:26.990
Anyway, he's taken a little bit
of a shine to your daughter,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.160
and it would mean the world to him

16:28.170 --> 16:31.140
if he could come over and meet her.

16:31.150 --> 16:34.370
That's very sweet,
and I don't want to seem impolite,

16:34.380 --> 16:36.870
but this is our one-on-one time.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.780
I understand,
and you should have that,

16:38.790 --> 16:40.650
but we're only talking a couple
of minutes here.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.970
Just enough time to put a smile on

16:41.980 --> 16:43.660
a young boy's face.
Now?!

16:43.670 --> 16:45.640
No!

16:46.960 --> 16:49.130
Look, I appreciate you

16:49.140 --> 16:51.780
coming over,
but I think we'll pass.

16:51.790 --> 16:54.200
Fine. Sorry to bother you.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.970
Real smooth.

16:59.870 --> 17:02.490
Okay, you really gotta help me
out here.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.490
Sir, I am having dinner
with my daughter.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.900
And I am here with my nephew.
Let's face it.

17:06.910 --> 17:08.490
they'd rather be sitting
and talking to each other

17:08.500 --> 17:10.900
than hanging out
with a couple of old farts like us.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.530
What did you call me?

17:12.540 --> 17:14.940
No, no, no, not not you, us.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.950
I was being funny.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.540
I don't think you're funny at all.

17:19.849 --> 17:23.030
Well, clearly, you don't know me.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.390
I'm Charlie.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.300
Yes, well, Charlie,
I've asked you to leave us alone.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.640
I understand and I will, but...

17:29.650 --> 17:31.480
Honey, get me a refill.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.840
Yo, dumb ass, go get a refill!

17:33.850 --> 17:35.440
Now?!  Yes, now!

17:37.030 --> 17:39.670
My brother's kid, not my own.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.840
I warned you.

17:45.850 --> 17:48.190
It's worse than the potpourri.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.380
I see you like the diet cola.

17:53.390 --> 17:55.790
If I may say so,
you don't need to watch your weight.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.090
Here you go.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.150
Clean and dry.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.510
Thank you. Thank you.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.860
Are you all right?

18:05.870 --> 18:07.640
Oh, yeah. Little Alan's fine.

18:07.650 --> 18:09.780
The twins got the worst of it.

18:10.230 --> 18:12.150
Good, good.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.830
Listen, Donna, you were right.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.150
This relationship is over.
Over?

18:19.160 --> 18:22.100
Well, what else is there
to do besides call it quits?

18:22.110 --> 18:25.600
Well, II thought maybe we could
take it to the next level.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.370
Next level?

18:27.380 --> 18:30.200
What's beyond mindnumbing,
tedious and boring?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.880
I'll tell you what's beyond it.
Death.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.870
No, thank you,
I've already been married.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.760
But, Alan...  I'm sorry, but
it's just, it'time we faced the truth.

18:38.770 --> 18:42.140
I have no romantic feelings
for you anymore.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.400
None?

18:43.410 --> 18:44.780
None at all.

18:45.910 --> 18:47.720
Oh, oh...

18:47.730 --> 18:50.810
Come on, Donna,
crying doesn't solve anything.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.030
But believe me,
it's better to end this now

18:53.040 --> 18:55.090
while we're still friends.

18:59.810 --> 19:01.710
Goodbye, my friend.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.670
Oh, just get out.

19:19.770 --> 19:21.770
What are you doing?

19:21.780 --> 19:23.180
Nothing.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.570
- Hi. You must be Alan.
- Yes.

19:28.580 --> 19:32.670
Forget it, Georgia,
it's not gonna happen.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.370
What's not gonna happen?

19:40.380 --> 19:45.370
I thought I could spice up
our relationship with a threeway.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.820
A... a threeway?

19:49.830 --> 19:54.410
But I didn't realize you had
no romantic feelings for me at all.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.520
Now hang on.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.600
Um, III think you may have
misinterpreted my remarks.

20:01.610 --> 20:03.790
Oh, honey, I'm here for you.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.950
Now, see, you really need
to be more clear about what you meant

20:06.960 --> 20:08.630
by taking it to the next level.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.730
See, I-I-I'm fine with this.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.810
This could help.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.040
Oh, go to hell.

20:38.660 --> 20:41.120
So was the friend goodlooking?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.710
Spectacular.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.340
Wow.

20:45.350 --> 20:45.940
Sounds like you blew

20:45.950 --> 20:48.420
what could've been the best night
of your life.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.460
The best night?

20:49.470 --> 20:52.410
No, no, that...
that was the night Jake was born.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.410
You have a threeway the night
Jake was born?

20:55.730 --> 20:58.680
Okay, I blew the best night
of my life.

20:58.770 --> 21:02.490
Now, don't worry, you'll get
another opportunity someday.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.720
How do you figure?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.510
Well, you may have
to wait a few decades,

21:05.520 --> 21:07.830
but I hear the ratio
of gals to geezersBE

21:07.840 --> 21:10.700
in those senior living facilities
is two to one.

21:11.790 --> 21:13.720
And imagine the progress
they'll have made

21:13.730 --> 21:15.830
in boner pills by that time.

21:17.730 --> 21:19.820
Are you staring at me?

21:20.950 --> 21:24.040
'Cause it fells like
you're staring at me.
