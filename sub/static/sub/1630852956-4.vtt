WEBVTT

00:03.640 --> 00:05.600
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.520
All you have to do is sit with
Jack Nelson and talk about

00:08.520 --> 00:10.040
a new golden age.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.600
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby... It will be you.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.840
The future belongs to us.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.040
Your daughter has Consumption.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.040
Consumption is a very
infectious disease.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.200
While they X-ray Ruby,
they have to X-ray us.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.240
It'll be the girl's mother who laid
the curse.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.360
Perhaps she waited until your little
girl was seven

00:25.360 --> 00:26.640
so you'd know how it feels.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.280
Now that I'm without whisky, I can
hear the spirits clearly

00:29.280 --> 00:31.600
and they are saying Ruby will be
well if I make amends.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.200
She's gone, Tommy.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.760
This programme contains some scenes

00:34.760 --> 00:37.120
which some viewers may find
upsetting, strong language,

00:37.120 --> 00:40.160
discriminatory language and content
and some scenes of a sexual nature.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.200
LATCH CLUNKS

00:42.200 --> 00:44.640
DOOR CREAKS

00:44.640 --> 00:47.080
WIND GENTLY WHISTLES

03:07.520 --> 03:10.320
WIND SOFTLY WHISTLES

03:24.000 --> 03:25.240
Arthur.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.400
I've written some words.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.360
I can't speak 'em.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.320
ARTHUR EXHALES SHARPLY

03:35.320 --> 03:36.960
You're the oldest.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.880
You speak 'em for me.
ARTHUR EXHALES SHARPLY

03:47.760 --> 03:51.280
I'm sorry, brother. I can't do it.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.920
CREAKING

04:21.680 --> 04:23.920
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.400
She deserved a golden carriage.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.560
But we didn't afford ourselves
that luxury.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.800
Because gold doesn't work.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.280
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.440
LAMP CREAKS

05:07.000 --> 05:11.680
This place was her favourite place
in the whole world.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.360
And she used to say...

05:14.720 --> 05:15.960
.."Dad...

05:18.800 --> 05:21.280
.."you never know what's going to
come down the river."

05:23.360 --> 05:24.600
And it's true.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.000
Little Ruby's fate came
a thousand miles too soon.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.880
But in her name and in her memory
things will change.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.800
And whatever comes down the river
from now on we will make good...

05:51.560 --> 05:53.960
..we will make peaceful and honest
and good

05:53.960 --> 05:56.280
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.000
In her memory we will do this.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.440
HE SNIFFLES

06:06.680 --> 06:12.720
But for now, we send her on,
to wherever it is you go...

06:15.040 --> 06:17.160
..in the hope that if there
is a destination...

06:19.840 --> 06:22.120
..that it's a yard like this,

06:22.120 --> 06:25.800
with horses and boats for her
to play on.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.720
Tom, I've got the petrol.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.520
TOM EXHALES SHARPLY

06:43.520 --> 06:45.120
Who will light the flame?

06:50.520 --> 06:51.840
Jeremiah?

06:58.040 --> 07:01.720
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.320
You light the flame.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.440
No, no! No! Lizzie...

07:06.440 --> 07:09.880
No, you won't burn her! No!

07:09.880 --> 07:11.240
Lizzie, shush, shush, shush!

07:11.240 --> 07:14.360
SHE SOBS

07:14.360 --> 07:16.640
I just want to see her.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.680
I just want to see her face. We'll
go and see her together. Come on.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.920
We'll go and see her together. Yeah.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.000
SHE CRIES

07:33.560 --> 07:34.920
Oh, my baby.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.400
SHE SNIFFLES

07:45.120 --> 07:46.720
SHE SNIFFLES

07:54.880 --> 07:57.120
The devils who did this will pay,
Ruby.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.720
What do you mean?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.480
What do you mean?

08:09.240 --> 08:10.560
Where are you going?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.360
THEY MOUTH SILENTLY

08:52.840 --> 08:55.240
SHE MOUTHS SILENTLY

09:13.000 --> 09:16.040
SHE MOUTHS SILENTLY

09:38.040 --> 09:40.840

10:02.840 --> 10:05.920
Riley, I think the police are here.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.680
Evadne Barwell?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.920
Yeah. Who's asking?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.200
HE COCKS GUN

10:15.200 --> 10:17.040
I am here on behalf of
the blue sapphire.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.880
SCREAMING

10:27.400 --> 10:29.800
Don't shoot! There are babies!

10:29.800 --> 10:32.240
SHRIEKING, BABY CRIES

10:35.960 --> 10:37.880
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

11:54.600 --> 11:55.960
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

12:13.520 --> 12:16.360
HE EXHALES AND GRUNTS

12:31.720 --> 12:34.440
ENGINE RUNS

12:40.920 --> 12:42.560
ENGINE STOPS

12:43.520 --> 12:45.160
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

12:59.520 --> 13:01.320
Gold dust.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.960
Our business is done, Esme.
Get out of the car.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.200
Not quite done, Tommy.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.120
I thought this would be a good time.
In fact, it's the perfect time.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.160
Some business is still unfinished.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.920
Christians say, "The Lord gives,
the Lord takes away."

13:19.920 --> 13:21.960
Our spirits are the same.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.200
Spirits just took away your child.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.160
Get out of the car, Esme.
ENGINE STARTS

13:26.160 --> 13:29.160
But those same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

13:29.160 --> 13:32.240
HE SIGHS
What child?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.840
ENGINE STOPS

13:33.840 --> 13:36.120
A daughter lost.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.400
A son found.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.080
Before you went to France,

13:42.080 --> 13:45.440
a long time ago at Appleby Fair
you slept with a girl.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.960
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

13:49.400 --> 13:52.920
She said you slept together under
a hazel tree, May 1914.

13:54.920 --> 13:59.400
When she fell pregnant, her father
threatened to kill you,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.400
but you'd already joined the army
and gone away to France.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.120
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don't you, Tommy.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.600
Whoever that boy is, Esme...

14:17.040 --> 14:19.360
..whoever he is, our business is
done here. I brought you

14:19.360 --> 14:22.880
to this camp for a reason, and I
brought him as well.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.040
He is yours.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.160
A boy born with hazel eyes.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.640
He calls himself Duke.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.000
His mother is dead. He's a thief.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.560
He works the fairgrounds, but he

14:36.560 --> 14:39.640
says he wants more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.760
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

14:47.400 --> 14:49.280
..I'll send him to you.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.440
If you give me a bit more gold...

14:54.360 --> 14:57.600
..I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man far,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.200
far more than big wheels
and carousels.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.520
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

15:02.520 --> 15:04.360
Is our business done or not, Tommy?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.920
I know where you went.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.920
I'm going to spend more hours
working in the Commons

15:49.920 --> 15:51.040
with Mr Churchill.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.320
His fight is my fight.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.200
I sat like a stone and thought about
you killing someone in her name.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.800
And the Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.280
I will set up a fund to research the
causes and cures for Consumption.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.120
Did the woman you kill
have children?

16:04.120 --> 16:07.480
10,000 children die every year,
Lizzie. Go to bed, Tommy.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.120
I've been reading about new
research.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.720
Stop and close your fucking eyes.
I will not...

16:11.720 --> 16:13.360
I will not stop!

16:13.360 --> 16:15.680
What is this good that you
will become?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.640
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

16:25.880 --> 16:27.600
I killed a woman.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.720
I killed a woman and three men.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.240
And their bodies will be thrown
aboard the boat,

16:33.240 --> 16:34.680
like all the other bodies,

16:34.680 --> 16:37.400
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.520
Do you understand?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.840
Yeah.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.680
The doctor from the Sanatorium
called and said that he needs

16:58.680 --> 17:00.640
to speak to you urgently.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.920
But I think now you are beyond
the help of doctors. Lizzie...

17:09.480 --> 17:11.160
Frances said Arthur's here.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.000
Tommy?

17:46.920 --> 17:48.520
Tom? Yeah, it's me.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.160
Ah, fuck.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.400
Arthur, give me a light, will you?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.800
I can't find my lighter.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.920
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

18:27.240 --> 18:29.640
I'm sorry I couldn't speak at the
wagon, Tom.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.360
Don't be sorry.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.960
What are you doing here?

18:49.320 --> 18:52.000
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.640
Nearly empty, this barrel.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.920
There are plenty of barrels, Arthur.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.480
Start another barrel.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.000
I thought maybe they're all full
of fucking blood.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.600
The junk, Tom...

19:14.560 --> 19:16.160
..fucks you up your mind.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.960
You know, Arthur.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.200
You was already fucked up.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.520
You was fucked up since you
were a kid.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.880
This is my theory.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.600
It's from that time I gave you

19:40.600 --> 19:43.080
a beating when you were 12
and I was nine.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.320
We were fighting over cigarettes.

19:48.880 --> 19:53.840
Maybe when I had you down
on the ground,

19:53.840 --> 19:56.960
I gave you one too many to
the head.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.760
It was a draw, though, Tom.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.760
Nah, I beat you.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.320
I had you pinned.
You actually didn't.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.320
We both agreed. You're so fucked,
you can't remember, brother.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.680
I do. I do remember little things.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.240
I know you do.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.680
So, do I.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.680
The fog and the gas is clearing, eh?

20:37.960 --> 20:39.280
TOMMY COUGHS

21:17.960 --> 21:20.280
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.720
That's...

21:28.560 --> 21:30.480
Tommy...stuff any more.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.920
You don't drink no more, Tom.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.880
After Polly was gone, Arthur...

22:02.200 --> 22:04.160
..I thought I could just march
and march.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.360
I just kept up that fucking left,

22:07.360 --> 22:09.960
right, left, right, left, right,
fucking rhythm.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.720
I'd never have to stop.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.960
Then Ruby went.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.360
I stumbled and crashed.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.720
And now here I am...

22:31.440 --> 22:36.240
..sat on my arse on the ground

22:36.240 --> 22:38.440
like a fucking tunneller..

22:40.640 --> 22:42.800
..with my old comrade Arthur.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.280
Remember the January, Arthur?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.160
The family boat?

22:54.920 --> 22:56.720
The whole family living on something

22:56.720 --> 22:59.000
the size of ten of these
fucking barrels.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.000
Remember that night at Tile Cross,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.440
16 of us sleeping on the boat,
the coppers come.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.240
We all swam like rats.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.080
Except for Arthur.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.840
Arthur holds them off with
a boat hook, all on his own.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.880
And I remember,

23:24.880 --> 23:27.480
I climbed back up at the lock
and looked back

23:27.480 --> 23:30.600
and saw you waving that
fucking boat hook

23:30.600 --> 23:33.640
in the copper's faces...
ARTHUR CHUCKLES

23:33.640 --> 23:34.880
..on your own.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.760
That's when I realised.

23:39.640 --> 23:44.200
When I had you on the ground,
all them years ago,

23:44.200 --> 23:46.360
it's because you let me win.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.720
You wanted me to win.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.800
you've wanted me to win ever since.

24:00.080 --> 24:06.720
What chance do I have...if you start
doing that again, eh?

24:08.680 --> 24:10.920
You'll stop.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.000
You'll stop cos the family
needs you to.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.760
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.800
You remember Dudley canal,
line number one?

24:20.800 --> 24:25.760
3,172 yards of fucking
pitch blackness and rats swimming.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.320
Yeah. Then we'd come round that
corner and there'd be

24:28.320 --> 24:31.000
a shaft of light.
And then we'd know.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.720
Yeah. And you and me would both know
it was nearly done.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.040
That's where we are now, Arthur.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.040
Just a few more yards to go.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.280
Then you'll change your ways.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.080
And I'll change the fucking world.

25:08.440 --> 25:14.480
In the moss

25:14.480 --> 25:21.240
In the dark

25:21.240 --> 25:27.240
From the start

25:27.240 --> 25:34.120
near the cloud of you

25:49.360 --> 25:55.400
And inlay black, so righteous you

26:02.400 --> 26:05.880
while your mistakes loom

26:05.880 --> 26:09.600
and it's drowning all

26:12.320 --> 26:15.120
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would've had dinner.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.960
There are drinks and sandwiches, if
you want. We're not here to eat.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.080
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.400
Please, tell Mr Shelby on behalf of
us all

26:23.400 --> 26:25.360
that changing the world can wait.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.000
He doesn't want to wait.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.520
There is Champagne.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.840
Oh, goodie.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.680
Charles?

26:44.240 --> 26:45.560
I heard cars.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.520
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

26:51.520 --> 26:52.720
I know.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.800
Dad, there's a Bentley and a
Rolls-Royce.

27:00.760 --> 27:01.800
Yeah.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.320
Go to bed, Charles.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.800
I can't sleep.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.080
I see her, when I shut my eyes.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.800
Go to your mum.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.880
She'll be awake.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.840
She holds on to me.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.360
Let her hold on to you.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.680
You hear me?

27:32.680 --> 27:34.160
Always let her hold on to you.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.640
Go on.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.200
Mr Shelby, the guests said they
would understand if...

27:44.200 --> 27:46.280
Have you served them drinks? Yes.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.520
Yeah.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.560
OK, Frances.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.640
The agenda is in my head.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.960
The agenda is in my head.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.200
I'm OK.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.880
Do I look OK?

28:20.560 --> 28:22.800
If someone touches you, you won't
shatter.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.400
Sing it.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.440
Sing it. I love that song.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.480
I...

28:30.480 --> 28:33.880
..can't be singing rebel songs in
a house in grief and mourning.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.720
Sing it to me softly.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.960
It breaks my heart.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.480
Don't look at him. He's English.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.680
He can block his ears.

28:45.560 --> 28:50.240
Darling, should she sing her rebel
IRA song, while we wait

28:50.240 --> 28:52.120
or would that be inappropriate?

28:55.640 --> 28:59.440
You know I went to a meeting of
similar intent to this in Berlin.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.200
Attended by the Chancellor
himself...

29:02.200 --> 29:04.440
..and Goering and Himmler.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.600
It lasted until the sun came up.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.160
We spoke about the future of the
world in a serious way.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.440
When the first rays of light entered
the room,

29:16.440 --> 29:19.360
we all stood and stared at it, as if
it were the world to come.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.360
There was no singing, no giggling.

29:26.440 --> 29:30.240
And when breakfast was served on the
terrace, overlooking the mountains,

29:30.240 --> 29:31.920
they brought up some Jews.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.480
And while we ate our eggs, they were
forced to eat grass.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.480
And we watched as we sipped our
coffee.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.880
We should all remember this is
serious business.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.760
Oh, Diana.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.680
Now, look what you've done. You have
killed the mood.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.240
Let her sing her fucking song to
raise our spirits. Go on, please.

30:24.040 --> 30:28.680
they call Belfast

30:32.400 --> 30:36.800
happiness

30:36.800 --> 30:40.760
in that neat little town

31:08.000 --> 31:09.520
Did it break?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.160
Mum will fix it for you.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.120
GLASS SHATTERS

31:13.120 --> 31:19.120
or black and white, bird?

31:19.120 --> 31:20.920
MEN LAUGH

31:23.280 --> 31:28.520
but the feeling is old

31:30.440 --> 31:35.120
shorten the road

31:39.600 --> 31:45.640
love was wrong

31:53.560 --> 31:59.120
fathom, blackbird

32:02.720 --> 32:08.160
I fear and I long

32:10.000 --> 32:14.880
shorten the road

32:31.120 --> 32:32.640
GUN FIRES

32:38.880 --> 32:44.920
and show me a song

32:52.680 --> 32:58.240
bird?

33:02.600 --> 33:08.640
dream alone

33:26.880 --> 33:29.280
She's not here any more.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.080
Mr Shelby. No, please, no
condolences.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.480
Thank you all for coming.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.480
Now, let's try to find out

33:54.480 --> 33:56.840
how this new world of ours will
look, shall we?

34:03.680 --> 34:06.240
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn to
what practical things

34:06.240 --> 34:10.600
Mr Nelson can do to further our
cause, while he's in the country.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.120
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.040
Which is kind of why I'm here,
right?

34:17.040 --> 34:20.880
We do, indeed, have things for you
to whisper into the President's ear.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.560
Tell him we are England.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.080
We are the mood England is in.

34:27.080 --> 34:31.560
And in Ireland, appeasers to the
English abound

34:31.560 --> 34:35.760
but we represent the true liberated
spirit of the country that...

34:35.760 --> 34:37.120
..populated your own.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.280
I hear about communists in both
places.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.400
We are the bulwark against them.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.480
When it comes to the working class,

34:48.480 --> 34:51.840
we could move our people from
Republicanism...

34:51.840 --> 34:53.880
..to Fascism with just a nudge.

34:55.240 --> 34:56.320
They trust us.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.400
You ride with hounds, Mr Mosley.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.320
Will you hunt communists?

35:02.320 --> 35:05.160
Oh, my hounds are baying.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.000
Shelby...

35:07.000 --> 35:08.680
..you run as a socialist.

35:16.160 --> 35:19.760
Mr Shelby has one of the largest
Commons majorities in England.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.200
In the heart of England.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.760
When the time comes, he'll resign
his party whip

35:26.760 --> 35:28.440
and run as an independent.

35:32.520 --> 35:35.920
But underneath, do you truly believe
in the cause, Mr Shelby?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.960
I'm here.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.160
Mr Nelson, I'm here four nights...

35:58.280 --> 36:00.000
Four nights after and I am here...

36:02.280 --> 36:05.360
..in this room, in this meeting,
I am here and I am serious.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.520
Prove it to him.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.520
Prove it physically.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.640
Perish Judah.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.560
Perish Judah.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.360
That thing is going to get us
killed.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.920
Go to bed.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.280
At school, they've stopped talking
to me.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.120
They say the black rubs off.

37:05.160 --> 37:08.360
When they come to power, they'll
take her off you.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.880
They're going to separate us all
out.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.520
They'll send her to Africa.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.560
Yeah?

37:19.560 --> 37:21.360
And where will they send you?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.360
Where will they send you, Karl?

37:25.520 --> 37:28.320
You're half Gypsy, so...

37:28.320 --> 37:29.720
..to Egypt maybe?

37:34.680 --> 37:37.520
Something I never told you before...

37:37.520 --> 37:39.280
..because it wasn't important.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.120
Maybe now, it is.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.280
Your dad was Jewish.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.640
He was the son of a tailor in
Stechford.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.200
They changed their name to Thorne

37:52.200 --> 37:54.520
to stop the bricks coming through
the window.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.600
So, where will they send you, Karl?

38:02.000 --> 38:05.120
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your President

38:05.120 --> 38:08.520
that the aristocracy and the
meritocracy are united

38:08.520 --> 38:11.560
in their conviction that a new order
is coming.

38:13.600 --> 38:18.160
Also, Mr Nelson, at present our
weapons are coming from Germany.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.600
The British are closing our supply
lines down.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.720
We would value a supply from Boston.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.840
Weapons, I can give you, if they're
to be used in a good cause.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.840
And while on the subject of import
and export,

38:30.840 --> 38:34.480
Mr Shelby, in light of our new
relationship,

38:34.480 --> 38:36.640
and since you have proven your
commitment

38:36.640 --> 38:39.080
in a most extraordinary way,

38:39.080 --> 38:43.200
Boston is now officially open for
the importation of your merchandise.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.760
Good.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.720
If we have established what we came
here to establish,

39:34.720 --> 39:36.520
perhaps we should all say goodnight.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.760
Absolutely.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.800
HE SHOUTS

40:25.360 --> 40:29.600
That's the same typewriter you
bought me all those years ago...

40:29.600 --> 40:31.440
..to help me become respectable.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.960
Do you remember?

40:35.680 --> 40:36.880
Yeah.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.520
This arrived.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.000
It's from the sanatorium.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.840
I've already paid Ruby's medical
bills.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.800
I don't think it's a bill.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.520
It says it's urgent. It's from the
senior consultant.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.360
Why didn't you come to bed?

41:23.800 --> 41:25.760
Why didn't you come to bed?

41:31.440 --> 41:33.760
I'm typing up my recollection of the
meeting.

41:35.320 --> 41:40.280
If I...if I do it straight away, I
can quote people word for word.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.040
The information is more...

41:44.040 --> 41:46.480
..useful to Mr Churchill if it is
word for word.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.760
I burnt her chair.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.240
The paint on the wood left a smell
in the air.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.000
I didn't open the window.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.280
I quite like the smell.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.600
Not yet.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.640
Not yet.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.240
I have this work to do cos now I
know...

43:04.240 --> 43:05.360
..that I will change.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.360
That I have to change.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.920
And change for good, Lizzie.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.680
Not just yet.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.120
PHONE RINGS

43:52.400 --> 43:53.520
Hello?

43:57.880 --> 43:59.160
Oh.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.080
and devotion

44:19.080 --> 44:22.600
and terror

44:22.600 --> 44:26.800
I do, I really try

44:26.800 --> 44:30.960
Baby, I do, I error

44:30.960 --> 44:34.760
my darling one

44:34.760 --> 44:38.360
the very dregs

44:38.360 --> 44:41.480
blocking the sun

44:41.480 --> 44:45.560
the inside of her legs

44:45.560 --> 44:49.440
and mangled

44:49.440 --> 44:53.040
go jingle-jangle

44:53.040 --> 44:58.720
Jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle

45:07.200 --> 45:08.720
KNOCKING

45:13.760 --> 45:15.040
I saw him leave.

45:17.080 --> 45:20.360
He keeps this apartment expressly
for this purpose, doesn't he?

45:22.400 --> 45:24.320
Are you following me, Mr Shelby?

45:25.440 --> 45:27.360
I'm flattered...

45:27.360 --> 45:29.320
..but why?

45:29.320 --> 45:30.960
When I do business with someone,

45:30.960 --> 45:33.720
I make it my business to know their
secrets.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.400
Mosley's reputation is no secret.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.520
Not him, you.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.280
How did you know I'd come here?

45:46.280 --> 45:48.640
I know things.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.000
I read people's minds, you know.

45:53.680 --> 45:57.000
Little glances across tables. It's a
gift.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.200
The whole family...

45:59.200 --> 46:01.000
..witches and sorcerers.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.840
Your uncle will disown you.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.760
Fucking his business partner behind
his back.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.000
You think he has morals?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.280
He's a Catholic.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.760
Men do what they want, women do what
they are told.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.320
Will you tell Michael?

46:27.600 --> 46:28.920
Michael is family.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.920
We are a family healed.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.960
You have no interest in me...

46:35.960 --> 46:37.200
..or in Michael.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.760
So, why don't you just tell me what
you actually want?

46:53.880 --> 46:56.520
You will be with Mosley...

46:56.520 --> 46:57.920
..when he's in Berlin.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.240
You'll be in the room,

47:00.240 --> 47:03.080
when he meets senior members of the
German Government.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.440
I want to know what is discussed...

47:06.440 --> 47:08.280
..and I want to know what is
decided.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.040
And if I lie?

47:14.360 --> 47:15.800
I will know.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.880
You know Michael thinks you're the
devil...

47:28.520 --> 47:30.600
..and I think he might actually be
right.

47:32.360 --> 47:34.960
That was the other reason I came
here.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.840
What are Michael's real intentions
toward me, Gina?

47:38.840 --> 47:40.320
And if you lie, I will know.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.160
Tommy...

47:48.680 --> 47:52.080
..he intends to complete the deal.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.680
And then, you both walk away.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.520
Fuck.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.120
BUZZING

49:29.640 --> 49:31.640
KNOCKING

49:31.640 --> 49:32.880
Come.

49:35.280 --> 49:37.120
Mr Shelby, Doctor Holford.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.440
Send him in.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.040
You said it had to be in person.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.280
Here I am.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.800
You might want to sit down.

50:03.160 --> 50:06.320
Mr Shelby, I know that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

50:07.920 --> 50:09.720
..but I have news that cannot wait.

50:14.840 --> 50:20.000
When you were X-rayed and examined
at the sanatorium ten days ago...

50:22.200 --> 50:25.280
..there was no TB found in your
lung.

50:27.520 --> 50:30.640
But I am afraid they found something
else.

50:30.640 --> 50:33.080
Something related to your daughter's
illness.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.960
They tried to speak to you at the
hospital

50:39.960 --> 50:41.600
but you were not co-operating.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.920
After your daughter's death,

50:45.920 --> 50:49.760
you could not be found to be
informed in person.

50:49.760 --> 50:53.040
Eventually, as your personal doctor,
they called me.

50:56.400 --> 50:59.360
I didn't offer you tea. You look
like death. Do you want tea?

51:01.200 --> 51:02.360
No.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.680
At the sanatorium, they conducted
blood tests.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.560
The tests suggest that the shadow
you can see

51:12.560 --> 51:14.720
at the base of your skull...

51:14.720 --> 51:16.160
..is not cancer.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.080
It is tuberculoma.

51:21.640 --> 51:25.120
A tubercular growth caused by the
same bacteria as TB.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.960
You may have picked it up from your
daughter.

51:32.760 --> 51:36.960
Once this disease enters a
household, it can run wild.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.560
It can be transmitted with a simple
kiss.

51:43.720 --> 51:46.320
It seems the Shelby household is no
exception.

51:50.400 --> 51:54.440
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware that
you are still grieving...

51:55.840 --> 51:58.280
..but you must understand this is
very serious.

52:00.520 --> 52:03.760
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must've been rapid.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.960
I have no doubt that you are already
experiencing symptoms?

52:10.640 --> 52:12.640
Have you recently suffered seizures?

52:14.040 --> 52:19.600
Bouts of weakness, dissociation,
hallucinations?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.240
Why didn't you come and see me?

52:31.960 --> 52:33.160
I have work to do.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.600
Am I a danger to others?

52:40.400 --> 52:42.080
No.

52:42.080 --> 52:45.720
Unlike TB, tuberculoma is not
infectious.

52:45.720 --> 52:49.880
Mr Shelby, it is not infectious...

52:49.880 --> 52:52.240
..but in your case...

52:52.240 --> 52:54.360
..I am afraid it is inoperable.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.120
The growth is in your brain stem.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.520
Any attempt to remove it

52:59.520 --> 53:01.960
would result in trauma and brain
haemorrhage.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.520
Whilst you were refusing my calls,

53:08.520 --> 53:11.880
I showed your X-rays to three of
the best surgeons in the country.

53:15.800 --> 53:19.040
They all said they would not
operate...

53:19.040 --> 53:20.400
..as it would be futile.

53:22.080 --> 53:26.360
Of course, you will want a second
opinion for yourself.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.760
Doctor Helen Rutherford at St
Thomas'.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.080
She is a friend.

53:43.360 --> 53:44.800
This...

53:46.640 --> 53:48.000
How bad will it get?

53:54.400 --> 53:56.640
As the tumour grows,

53:56.640 --> 54:00.480
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

54:05.120 --> 54:09.840
Eventually, you will need people
around you constantly,

54:09.840 --> 54:11.560
who love you very much.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.120
How long?

54:19.760 --> 54:22.840
I understand you have defeated many
enemies, Mr Shelby.

54:24.280 --> 54:26.520
Now, you have a new one...

54:26.520 --> 54:27.800
..inside you.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.720
You cannot defeat it...

54:32.160 --> 54:34.880
..but you can keep it at bay for a
while.

54:34.880 --> 54:39.120
If you live correctly, if you are
determined and if you fight...

54:39.120 --> 54:41.080
I asked you a question.

54:41.080 --> 54:42.720
So, I want an answer.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.560
I don't want your fucking
platitudes.

54:45.560 --> 54:50.040
How long before I need people around
me, who love me very much?

54:54.960 --> 54:56.840
Sorry. It's fine, Lizzie.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.720
My accountant here was just leaving.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.920
I will telephone you, when I get
back to London.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.400
No, I don't have enough time.

55:08.400 --> 55:11.080
You're an accountant, give me a
fucking number now.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.920
One year.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.160
Perhaps 18 months.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.680
That's fine. That's all I need to
know.

55:19.680 --> 55:22.960
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.680
I will write to you, explaining the
full implications. Yeah, thank you.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.200
Good day.

55:42.440 --> 55:45.000
Something serious?

55:45.000 --> 55:47.240
No, no, just a...

55:47.240 --> 55:51.440
..just a bill I wasn't expecting and
I...

55:51.440 --> 55:53.040
I'll have to pay it.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.040
Will you give me a minute on my own,
Lizzie?

56:08.880 --> 56:10.240
Yeah.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.280
Not a devil...

56:30.360 --> 56:32.280
..just an ordinary mortal man.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.080
There will be a war in this
family...

56:43.320 --> 56:45.160
..and one of you will die.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.080
Polly.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.480
Just give me enough time to do what
I have to do.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.080
Kill.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.840
Kill.
