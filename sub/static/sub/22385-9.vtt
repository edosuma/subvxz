WEBVTT

00:03.129 --> 00:04.849
All right, everybody.

00:04.873 --> 00:06.298
As promised, tonight's the night.

00:06.791 --> 00:10.394
Like I keep saying,
the security here is a joke.

00:13.675 --> 00:15.707
See that security camera?

00:16.204 --> 00:18.038
'Cause it doesn't see us anymore.

00:18.106 --> 00:19.373
Video scrambler.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.441
80 bucks online. All right.

00:21.509 --> 00:23.145
Now here comes the crazy part.

00:23.184 --> 00:25.919
All it takes is one person
on the inside who flips,

00:25.981 --> 00:28.482
someone gets greedy and then
someone gets leverage,

00:28.543 --> 00:31.645
and then someone like me gets
into the restricted section.

00:31.913 --> 00:33.352
And here we are.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.735
The goods are behind that door.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.415
Ready to shock the world?

00:46.367 --> 00:48.735
Yeah. Done.

00:48.803 --> 00:50.771
Gonna be pretty hard
for them to ignore this now.

00:50.796 --> 00:51.882
Am I right?

00:51.907 --> 00:55.076
Yes. They'll take us seriously now.

01:01.255 --> 01:02.998
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!

01:07.155 --> 01:08.722
You guys hear from Weller or Jane?

01:08.790 --> 01:10.074
I've been calling all morning,
I'm getting nothing.

01:10.099 --> 01:11.776
- Think something's wrong?
- Not yet.

01:11.801 --> 01:13.593
It's just not like them to be late.

01:13.661 --> 01:14.713
What do you guys got?

01:14.738 --> 01:15.905
Well, we've been digging back

01:15.930 --> 01:17.431
into the tattoo cases we've solved

01:17.456 --> 01:18.941
and we found a common thread.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.160
Hank Crawford.

01:20.185 --> 01:22.686
As in "Business Capital" Hank Crawford?

01:22.711 --> 01:24.026
That's the photo you're going with?

01:24.072 --> 01:25.592
Well, it's not like he has a mug shot,

01:25.617 --> 01:27.148
but he does have some strange,

01:27.181 --> 01:29.182
tenuous connections to the tattoos.

01:29.284 --> 01:31.008
Hydrocarbon holdings in Kazah Rus.

01:31.301 --> 01:32.646
He moved a ton of capital

01:32.714 --> 01:34.147
through Kevin Loewe's hedge fund,

01:34.215 --> 01:36.059
and he took an insurance payout

01:36.084 --> 01:37.518
from Sacred Lynx Productions

01:37.543 --> 01:39.105
when they burned down
one of his buildings.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.159
So we've got nothing?

01:40.184 --> 01:42.985
No, Crawford is connected
to Hirst, too.

01:43.418 --> 01:45.290
He served as special advisor
on the White House

01:45.315 --> 01:47.116
that appointed her to be U.S. attorney,

01:47.169 --> 01:49.637
and when Hirst was
considering a senate run,

01:49.812 --> 01:52.013
one of Crawford's American companies

01:52.058 --> 01:53.959
funded a Super PAC to support her.

01:54.077 --> 01:56.445
Right before she suddenly
changed course

01:56.486 --> 01:58.111
and went the FBI route.

01:58.247 --> 02:00.195
Right before we arrested her,
she said the man

02:00.220 --> 02:02.539
she worked for is powerful
and doesn't like to lose.

02:02.597 --> 02:05.332
From the looks of all of his
companies and investments,

02:05.357 --> 02:07.492
the one thing Crawford
isn't into is losing.

02:07.517 --> 02:10.863
Tech, finance, airlines, food chains.

02:10.966 --> 02:13.993
Even the cosmetics company that
makes my favorite lip balm.

02:14.573 --> 02:15.740
I'm still gonna buy it.

02:15.808 --> 02:17.412
Oh, it's a tattoo hit.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.076
All right, Patterson,
that'll be your priority.

02:19.101 --> 02:21.736
I'll put forensic accountants
on Crawford's finances.

02:25.873 --> 02:28.108
Tom Jakeman. Welcome
to Marrakesh, chum.

02:28.675 --> 02:31.035
- How was your flight?
- Uh... Long.

02:31.202 --> 02:33.847
That's a great story.
Here's your return ticket.

02:33.914 --> 02:35.474
Sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

02:36.033 --> 02:37.520
I'm sorry, who are you?

02:37.623 --> 02:40.859
I'm Victor, Crawford's
VP of Operations.

02:41.782 --> 02:43.154
Flight leaves in a couple hours.

02:43.194 --> 02:44.357
You better get going.

02:44.425 --> 02:45.992
Yeah, uh...

02:46.304 --> 02:48.728
Crawford asked me to meet him
here to help out with a job.

02:48.796 --> 02:50.830
Come and work for me.

02:50.898 --> 02:52.399
Change of plans.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.834
Crawford's sitting this
one out... so are you.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.403
I'm doing the buy on my own.

02:57.476 --> 02:59.038
What are you buying?

02:59.458 --> 03:01.255
You were hired to
protect Blake... that's it.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.443
I got this.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.275
I'm not really in
the mood to die today.

03:05.475 --> 03:08.744
Yeah. I ran a little
background check on you, TJ.

03:08.950 --> 03:11.714
Australian defense force,
second commandos.

03:12.052 --> 03:13.680
You led an op to steal some laptops,

03:13.723 --> 03:15.357
got all FUBAR'd on the way out.

03:15.432 --> 03:18.410
Everyone died. Everyone but you.

03:19.215 --> 03:21.817
Hard pass.

03:22.846 --> 03:24.959
Our helicopter crashed on the way in.

03:25.095 --> 03:28.397
I survived, stole the laptops,
and got out on my own.

03:28.465 --> 03:31.124
Those records were falsified
to protect the mission.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.839
- You're not coming.
- Why not?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.446
I'm good to have around
when things go wrong,

03:34.471 --> 03:35.938
I see things, I improvise.

03:36.403 --> 03:38.185
Yeah, I bet you do.

03:38.441 --> 03:41.177
I could kill you with your own tie.

03:41.492 --> 03:43.252
I can tell by the knot
you're left-handed

03:43.277 --> 03:44.717
and there's just no way you can draw

03:44.742 --> 03:46.248
that Glock you're hiding
in time to spin,

03:46.273 --> 03:48.175
aim and shoot before I choke you out.

03:48.952 --> 03:50.519
Of course, if I really
wanted to kill you,

03:50.544 --> 03:51.693
I'd just steal your wallet

03:51.718 --> 03:53.158
and make you chase me around Morocco

03:53.195 --> 03:54.344
till your heart explodes.

03:54.691 --> 03:56.159
Those snowflakes on your upper lip

03:56.184 --> 03:57.544
tell me you're doing so much coke,

03:57.569 --> 03:59.871
you don't even notice
when you miss your nose.

04:00.535 --> 04:01.664
You must be a real hit

04:01.732 --> 04:03.766
at all Blake's fancy fundraisers, huh?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.754
Why don't you grab that bag?

04:05.822 --> 04:07.289
You can be my lookout.

04:13.282 --> 04:14.877
Still nothing from Weller and Jane?

04:14.902 --> 04:15.935
I just called.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.027
No answer.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.541
Maybe they overslept.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.309
Both of them?
The day after we arrest Hirst

04:20.334 --> 04:22.266
and expose a major conspiracy?

04:22.291 --> 04:24.169
Send a team over to their house,
make sure they're okay.

04:24.287 --> 04:26.380
- In the meantime, catch me up.
- All right.

04:26.446 --> 04:28.024
Early this morning, a high-level memo

04:28.091 --> 04:30.968
was sent from a government
storage facility to the DIA

04:31.054 --> 04:33.493
when it became clear that the
facility suffered a break-in.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.641
What we don't know, which facility,

04:35.666 --> 04:37.375
where it is, or what it stores.

04:37.634 --> 04:39.902
It's not a good sign when
the Defense Intelligence Agency

04:39.927 --> 04:40.939
is the first call.

04:40.964 --> 04:42.207
What dinged your system?

04:42.232 --> 04:43.935
A photo was attached to the memo.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.862
Someone spray-painted
the logo for Blue Dawn

04:46.930 --> 04:48.083
inside the facility.

04:48.108 --> 04:49.934
It's a direct action activist group.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.061
Mostly online,

04:51.086 --> 04:52.944
minimal followers, no real footprint.

04:52.969 --> 04:54.403
This is the Blue Dawn tattoo.

04:54.485 --> 04:56.422
So far, I haven't
been able to crack it.

04:56.447 --> 04:58.481
Hold up. Throw a 3-by-3 grid
on top of that.

04:59.068 --> 05:00.483
What does that look like to you?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.942
It's a slide puzzle.
I love these things.

05:03.087 --> 05:04.287
How did I not see this?

05:04.499 --> 05:05.993
Because it's already been slid.

05:06.022 --> 05:07.723
- So let's unslide it.
- If we do this,

05:07.812 --> 05:09.345
then we get...

05:10.467 --> 05:11.708
Total nonsense.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.100
Okay, maybe not. Look.

05:13.370 --> 05:15.254
These notches are
all grouped together now.

05:15.279 --> 05:17.547
And each grouping gives us a number.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.541
It's a URL.

05:19.751 --> 05:21.137
Some kind of message board.

05:21.162 --> 05:24.209
Looks like a user named "andWHY21"

05:24.234 --> 05:26.535
posted a video late last night,

05:26.579 --> 05:28.213
right around the time of the break-in.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.889
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:32.446
Or the exact time of the break-in.

05:32.471 --> 05:33.795
It seems to be a live feed.

05:33.924 --> 05:36.154
Can you fast-forward to the end,
see what they stole?

05:36.179 --> 05:37.813
Yeah, sure, it's not live anymore.

05:39.636 --> 05:40.963
<i>Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!</i>

05:41.031 --> 05:42.724
Just when it was starting to get good.

05:42.749 --> 05:44.383
Can you ID the intruders?

05:44.668 --> 05:47.048
Uh, not as quick as I can use metadata

05:47.073 --> 05:48.993
to figure out where
the video was uploaded from.

05:49.052 --> 05:51.920
Great, send the address to my
phone, we're heading there now.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.317
This day started off so well.
I was in such a good mood.

06:04.554 --> 06:08.023
Dave Kirkpatrick, DIA.
What's the FBI doing here?

06:08.124 --> 06:10.993
We didn't send word to
the more traditional agencies.

06:11.194 --> 06:13.562
No sense in sounding off alarm bells.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.667
Not till we know what's missing.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.687
Our alarm bells tend to ring early.

06:17.713 --> 06:19.528
- What is this place?
- And what's missing?

06:19.603 --> 06:22.705
This is a classified regional
storage facility of the DOE.

06:22.992 --> 06:24.707
There's only one reason
the Department of Energy

06:24.775 --> 06:26.542
would need a classified
storage facility.

06:27.356 --> 06:29.739
This is where they keep the nukes.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.095
Nuclear warheads on the right,

06:35.158 --> 06:37.493
non-nuclear test warheads on the left.

06:37.969 --> 06:39.855
Try not to rearrange anything.

06:40.196 --> 06:42.391
Why does the Department
of Energy keep nukes

06:42.459 --> 06:44.026
in padlocked containers?

06:44.215 --> 06:46.495
Okay, I'm not gonna lie,
the system has its flaws.

06:46.523 --> 06:47.923
And the DOE doesn't have the budget

06:47.947 --> 06:49.795
to update the
"in plain sight" initiative,

06:49.820 --> 06:51.220
and, of course, doing any retrofits

06:51.245 --> 06:53.194
would simply draw
attention to a facility

06:53.219 --> 06:55.104
that not even the FBI knew existed.

06:55.337 --> 06:57.866
So, here we are.

06:58.181 --> 07:00.283
This was obviously an inside job.

07:00.698 --> 07:02.423
It's always an inside job.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.648
My guys are checking
to see who called in sick,

07:04.673 --> 07:06.795
the DOE is running scans on inventory.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.693
No, this does not make any sense.

07:08.718 --> 07:10.619
Count them again.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.021
What's wrong?

07:12.089 --> 07:13.722
Uh, the inventory lines up.

07:14.037 --> 07:15.663
All of the containers
are accounted for.

07:15.688 --> 07:18.158
One of the intruders on
that video had bolt cutters.

07:18.358 --> 07:19.829
What video?

07:20.055 --> 07:21.489
I'll send you the link.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.856
Hey, why are these two padlocks
different than the others?

07:29.206 --> 07:31.474
You scan the actual warheads, right?

07:31.499 --> 07:32.593
I mean, you didn't just scan

07:32.618 --> 07:34.748
the bar codes on the containers?

07:34.991 --> 07:36.341
Well, what are we doing here

07:36.366 --> 07:38.934
if we're not gonna look
inside the damn containers?

07:39.316 --> 07:41.050
Are we gonna look inside
or are we gonna

07:41.118 --> 07:43.152
stand around like it's Christmas?!

07:50.373 --> 07:51.706
It's empty.

www.addic7ed.com

08:08.573 --> 08:10.574
I know you've been wrestling

08:10.647 --> 08:12.031
whether to look
for your daughter or not,

08:12.056 --> 08:13.657
and I haven't been very useful

08:13.863 --> 08:15.223
in helping you make that decision.

08:15.351 --> 08:18.553
- Look, I understand.
- No, you don't.

08:18.616 --> 08:20.216
The truth is, Jane,

08:20.451 --> 08:23.330
I don't want you to look for her

08:23.506 --> 08:26.075
because I know you won't find her.

08:26.169 --> 08:28.337
How would you know that?

08:28.526 --> 08:30.327
Because I...

08:30.394 --> 08:32.620
I killed your daughter.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.548
What? Wh...

08:34.611 --> 08:35.868
It was a mistake.

08:35.953 --> 08:37.442
Stop!

08:38.482 --> 08:40.850
Why... Why didn't you...

08:41.145 --> 08:43.839
I... I want to know everything.

08:44.215 --> 08:45.348
Everything,

08:45.996 --> 08:47.897
We met in Berlin.

08:48.558 --> 08:50.459
Sir, she was just here.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.019
You must have seen her.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.626
_

08:54.092 --> 08:55.203
I'll check.

08:55.228 --> 08:56.795
We're looking for the same person.

08:56.947 --> 08:58.381
Jane Doe?

08:58.468 --> 09:01.463
Or Alice Kruger, Remi...

09:01.545 --> 09:02.845
She has a lot of names.

09:03.153 --> 09:04.687
How do you know Jane?

09:05.758 --> 09:07.197
She's my mother.

09:07.454 --> 09:08.965
That's impossible.

09:09.178 --> 09:11.675
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't true...

09:11.795 --> 09:14.163
in more ways than one.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.273
That's my birth certificate.

09:17.061 --> 09:19.038
You could have doctored this.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.891
Why would I do that? It's true.

09:22.066 --> 09:24.334
Take my blood, run the DNA.

09:24.575 --> 09:26.442
I'm her daughter.

09:26.676 --> 09:28.252
What if it wasn't?

09:28.325 --> 09:29.875
Okay, this girl could have been lying.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.065
She wasn't.

09:31.090 --> 09:32.624
How could you be so sure without...

09:32.722 --> 09:34.500
- Did you run her DNA?
- No.

09:34.822 --> 09:37.156
But her face...

09:37.627 --> 09:41.256
The way she talked...
the way she moved.

09:42.246 --> 09:45.582
The fire inside of her, Jane.

09:47.771 --> 09:49.565
She was your daughter.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.274
My bellman saw this woman

09:52.299 --> 09:54.748
talking with a man
in the lobby one night.

09:54.773 --> 09:56.561
The man's name is Max Kohler.

09:56.888 --> 10:00.016
Max, uh... Max is a German gangster.

10:00.471 --> 10:02.678
He's into a little bit of everything.

10:02.753 --> 10:04.854
I went to see him when there was

10:04.879 --> 10:06.980
an attempt made on my life
in Switzerland.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.018
Someone tried to collect
the bounty on your head.

10:09.379 --> 10:12.671
I made it out okay,
but I lost my go-bag,

10:12.790 --> 10:16.693
and... I needed new passports
to get out of Europe.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.622
You must have just missed me.

10:19.292 --> 10:22.230
Avery, the Lebanese Mafia run Berlin.

10:22.319 --> 10:25.054
- So?
- Does Max Kohler sound Lebanese to you?

10:25.102 --> 10:27.339
And if they're letting him
operate on their turf,

10:27.653 --> 10:28.983
all right, it's far too risky for you

10:29.008 --> 10:30.098
to go and ask him about Jane.

10:30.123 --> 10:32.057
So I'll go and I'll
call you when I find her.

10:32.136 --> 10:33.660
Screw that. I don't know you.

10:33.685 --> 10:35.448
I have no reason to trust you.

10:35.506 --> 10:36.973
Whoa, hey.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.461
You approached me, remember?

10:39.550 --> 10:41.230
And if I hadn't,
you wouldn't know that Max

10:41.255 --> 10:43.316
operates our of a dry cleaner's
in Friedrichshain,

10:43.341 --> 10:45.817
so I'm either going
with you or I'm going alone,

10:45.842 --> 10:47.542
and if you don't like it,
you can go back home

10:47.567 --> 10:49.941
and I'll let you know
where she is when I find her.

10:50.327 --> 10:52.161
Why did you bring her to see Max?

10:52.637 --> 10:54.599
I didn't... I kept her close to me,

10:54.624 --> 10:55.837
so I could keep an eye on her.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.162
We found an abandoned office

10:57.187 --> 10:58.747
across the road from the dry cleaner's.

10:58.871 --> 11:01.834
We stayed there, waited
until Max showed up.

11:02.341 --> 11:04.449
Why now? It's been 18 years.

11:04.555 --> 11:07.490
Why start looking for Jane now?

11:08.263 --> 11:10.620
I've known I was adopted my whole life,

11:10.900 --> 11:14.557
but... I loved my parents
and they loved me.

11:14.721 --> 11:16.693
Why go searching
for someone who didn't?

11:17.088 --> 11:18.535
Jane loved you.

11:18.635 --> 11:20.836
Then why'd she give me up?

11:22.738 --> 11:26.166
Anyway, my... My mom died of cancer,

11:26.191 --> 11:31.011
and my dad killed himself,
so... guess I got curious.

11:31.660 --> 11:34.696
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:35.413 --> 11:37.414
Has Jane ever mentioned me?

11:38.968 --> 11:42.170
I told her you'd had your memory wiped.

11:43.754 --> 11:47.791
D... Did you tell her
about Shepherd or Roman?

11:48.157 --> 11:49.758
No.

11:51.454 --> 11:53.450
I told her about
the bounty on your head,

11:53.676 --> 11:55.748
and that's why you'd run away.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.014
To protect me.

11:59.236 --> 12:00.837
Protect our family.

12:01.859 --> 12:03.860
Memory-erasing drugs?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.442
A bounty on her head?

12:05.467 --> 12:07.367
What kind of a person is she?

12:07.415 --> 12:09.817
She's someone that helps people.

12:10.044 --> 12:11.640
- Protects them.
- Abandons them.

12:11.713 --> 12:14.637
If Jane did give you up for adoption,

12:14.782 --> 12:17.017
I'm sure she had a good reason.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.840
But she won't remember, right?

12:19.981 --> 12:21.435
Why she gave me up.

12:22.828 --> 12:24.825
I didn't give her up.

12:25.653 --> 12:28.806
Shepherd stole her from me
and sent her away.

12:29.004 --> 12:31.363
I know that now.
I didn't know that then.

12:31.519 --> 12:34.087
I... I fought for her.

12:34.328 --> 12:37.546
And now... sh-she thinks
I never loved her?

12:37.605 --> 12:40.808
No. I told her you loved her.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.895
I promise you.

12:43.979 --> 12:47.615
By the end, she knew, Jane.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.322
She knew.

12:49.411 --> 12:51.688
The Jane that I know,
if she knew about you,

12:51.713 --> 12:53.980
she would walk to the ends
of the earth to find you.

12:54.501 --> 12:56.303
Like you're doing for her.

12:56.424 --> 12:59.071
Like we are doing.

13:05.780 --> 13:06.814
There's Max.

13:06.901 --> 13:09.770
- Let's go.
- No, Avery, stop.

13:09.977 --> 13:11.510
You have to stay here.

13:11.612 --> 13:13.947
I am not gonna fight about this.

13:15.931 --> 13:17.765
I convinced her to stay in the office.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.759
She said that she would.

13:21.429 --> 13:22.839
She promised me.

13:24.358 --> 13:26.764
What happened, Kurt?

13:27.049 --> 13:28.883
I don't know.

13:29.178 --> 13:31.379
I went in there...

13:31.452 --> 13:33.720
and it was like they were expecting me.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:50.051 --> 13:52.152
No, no!

13:52.732 --> 13:55.297
Avery, hey... it's gonna be okay.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.744
Avery. Avery.

13:57.799 --> 13:59.132
Avery, just stay with me.

14:02.122 --> 14:04.557
We've got to get out of here!

14:20.203 --> 14:22.503
You just... left her there?

14:22.590 --> 14:24.458
They were closing in on me.

14:24.592 --> 14:26.408
I tried to get her out.

14:26.794 --> 14:28.929
I couldn't.

14:29.197 --> 14:31.665
If I had stayed any longer,
I would have died, too.

14:31.732 --> 14:33.264
Then you should have stayed.

14:33.315 --> 14:35.817
She wasn't supposed to be there, Jane.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.171
It was a mistake.

14:38.239 --> 14:40.251
If it was a mistake,

14:40.494 --> 14:42.462
then why didn't you tell me sooner?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.644
'Cause I was trying to protect you.

14:45.090 --> 14:46.934
You were trying to protect yourself.

14:47.528 --> 14:49.845
No. Why hear about a daughter

14:49.870 --> 14:51.438
that you didn't even know that you had,

14:51.552 --> 14:54.338
only to find out that she was dead...

14:54.722 --> 14:57.395
and your own husband killed her?

14:57.592 --> 15:01.528
Every chance you had
to tell me, you lied.

15:02.516 --> 15:04.197
What would it change?

15:04.588 --> 15:09.736
Us. It would change us.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.583
They keep calling.

15:28.870 --> 15:31.271
Sir, Assistant Director Reade sent us.

15:31.359 --> 15:34.924
Is Miss Doe here, too?
Are you both okay?

15:35.062 --> 15:36.932
We're fine. We're gonna
take the day off.

15:36.957 --> 15:38.274
There's been a development.

15:38.299 --> 15:39.539
Tell Reade to get someone else.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.182
- We need to...
- No.

15:41.249 --> 15:42.616
Don't.

15:43.725 --> 15:46.660
I need to be anywhere but here.

15:50.591 --> 15:52.725
Hey, I just unmasked the live-streamer.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.300
Photo's on your phone.

15:56.408 --> 15:58.313
Adam Taylor. He work here?

15:58.353 --> 16:00.421
Uh, yeah. He just badged in

16:00.641 --> 16:03.410
<i>30 minutes ago. If you
issue a lockdown, you can...</i>

16:03.658 --> 16:06.139
Oh, okay, well, never mind,
he just badged out.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.780
We're right outside the facility.

16:08.986 --> 16:10.095
I got him.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.879
Why the hell would he return
to the scene of the crime?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.039
It'd be more suspicious if he didn't.

16:13.064 --> 16:14.365
- Adam Taylor! FBI!
- Hands up!

16:14.390 --> 16:15.678
- Drop the phone!
- No, no, no, please wait!

16:15.703 --> 16:18.195
You don't understand!
They're gonna kill my kid!

16:31.730 --> 16:33.929
Went off without a hitch.
Let's get out of here.

16:34.013 --> 16:36.881
Glad I could help. So what did we buy?

16:38.347 --> 16:40.348
Damn, it's hot out here, huh?

16:40.460 --> 16:42.761
Let's get back to the hotel.

16:45.351 --> 16:47.218
We got company on our six.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.371
Yeah, over there, too.

16:51.396 --> 16:52.978
They were with the sellers at the buy.

16:53.003 --> 16:54.837
Without a hitch, huh?

16:55.462 --> 16:56.994
Looks like they're trying
to steal the package back.

16:57.019 --> 17:00.293
Here... Take it to the estate,
do whatever it takes.

17:00.381 --> 17:01.781
I'll lose 'em.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.328
We just put Adam in interrogation.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.983
He's freaking out.
Says the woman in the video

17:10.008 --> 17:11.742
wants to kill his son
but won't elaborate.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.557
- Still no idea who she is?
- Not even close.

17:13.845 --> 17:15.712
Even the super unique neck piercings

17:15.780 --> 17:18.015
don't match anyone in any database.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.548
Silver lining...
We opened every last container,

17:20.584 --> 17:22.659
and all of the warheads, save the two

17:22.684 --> 17:24.452
that she stole, of course,
are accounted for.

17:24.489 --> 17:26.890
Two missing nukes
is not a silver lining.

17:27.092 --> 17:29.326
- Can we track 'em?
- Not unless they're armed.

17:29.393 --> 17:30.894
- Seriously?
- Well, like I said,

17:30.928 --> 17:32.762
the current system leaves
a lot to be desired.

17:32.787 --> 17:34.388
We need to crack Adam. Weller, Jane,

17:34.413 --> 17:37.089
- take a run at him and...
- I'll do it on my own.

17:37.635 --> 17:38.935
He's scared.

17:39.063 --> 17:40.296
I have a softer approach.

17:41.024 --> 17:42.699
I'll work with Patterson.

17:42.767 --> 17:45.844
Okay. The rest of us will
look into the mystery woman,

17:45.869 --> 17:47.684
and let's get into Adam's phone.

17:49.768 --> 17:51.307
- Dave.
- Hey, Jake.

17:51.332 --> 17:53.099
Look, whatever you need
to find those nukes,

17:53.164 --> 17:54.598
you've got the CIA's full support.

17:54.678 --> 17:56.789
And assuming we're all
still alive tomorrow,

17:56.814 --> 17:58.054
we should discuss the game plan

17:58.079 --> 17:59.546
for taking down Hank Crawford.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.438
There's nothing to discuss.

18:01.673 --> 18:03.539
He just lost a major resource in Hirst.

18:03.602 --> 18:06.303
We go after him fast and hard
while he's on tilt.

18:06.511 --> 18:08.979
Oh, man, you are such a Fed.

18:10.933 --> 18:12.449
You have a better idea?

18:12.517 --> 18:15.555
Yeah, look. Crawford is untouchable.

18:15.646 --> 18:17.382
We need to play a very long game.

18:17.542 --> 18:20.030
We tried the long game with
Hirst and she almost played us.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.011
We get him for something
small, take him off the board,

18:22.036 --> 18:24.029
and we bury him... quicker
we arrest him, the better.

18:24.054 --> 18:25.315
Okay.

18:26.821 --> 18:28.207
You know he's wrong, right?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.467
- I'll handle it.
- Yeah.

18:31.766 --> 18:33.193
Please, I can't be here.

18:33.218 --> 18:34.880
She said she was gonna kill my son.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.673
We are going to help your son,
but you need to help us.

18:37.748 --> 18:42.063
I made that video to expose
flaws in our nuclear security,

18:42.240 --> 18:43.772
to fix a broken system.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.971
I... I never wanted to steal anything.

18:45.996 --> 18:47.463
I'm a whistleblower.

18:47.505 --> 18:49.999
I got tricked by a psychopath.

18:50.055 --> 18:52.140
Well, who is she? What does she want?

18:52.196 --> 18:54.900
Okay, sure, sure.
Her... Her name is Lana.

18:55.039 --> 18:57.874
I met her online
in the Blue Dawn forum.

18:57.908 --> 19:00.073
Okay, and it was her idea, so she knew

19:00.098 --> 19:01.658
that you worked
at the storage facility.

19:02.168 --> 19:04.568
I don't remember. And I just... I...

19:04.825 --> 19:07.504
I got us in and it became
very clear very quick

19:07.572 --> 19:09.240
that she was not an activist.

19:09.287 --> 19:12.989
Now, please, I need to call her.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.554
She said my son would be safe

19:14.579 --> 19:16.784
as long as I got her the codes.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.556
The codes to arm the warheads?

19:19.924 --> 19:21.424
They change every day,

19:21.483 --> 19:23.284
- and she gave me this special phone...
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:23.309 --> 19:25.595
You didn't give them to her?

19:26.065 --> 19:28.459
Adam, you didn't give her the codes?

19:29.352 --> 19:31.987
I had to.

19:32.569 --> 19:34.971
I texted her right
before you arrested me.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.130
I think I know who it is.
Is this the psychopath?

19:39.190 --> 19:40.865
That... That is her, that is Lana.

19:40.958 --> 19:43.718
Lana's full name is Svetlana Stepulov,

19:43.794 --> 19:46.529
sister of Anton Stepulov,
who I'm sure you all remember

19:46.611 --> 19:49.079
as the former number two
of the Dabbur Zann.

19:49.186 --> 19:51.821
Oh, you mean the Architect of Death.

19:52.963 --> 19:55.065
This city will feel my pain.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.960
I caught a glimpse at the back
of her neck in Adam's video.

19:58.294 --> 20:01.039
Those piercings match
a recent description of Lana

20:01.064 --> 20:03.093
I acquired from a source
close to the Dabbur Zann.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.829
I thought the Dabbur Zann
went dark when Anton retired.

20:05.963 --> 20:07.731
He didn't exactly retire.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.937
He's a guest of the CIA,
but his departure

20:09.962 --> 20:11.663
created a power vacuum
in the terror group.

20:11.736 --> 20:13.950
So she's using these
warheads to take control.

20:14.003 --> 20:16.907
Adam gave Lana the codes,
but they change every 24 hours,

20:17.077 --> 20:18.945
which means she is
planning on using them today.

20:18.983 --> 20:21.063
What if we get Adam to
call Lana to check on his son?

20:21.316 --> 20:22.956
Yeah. If you want to
put him on the phone,

20:22.981 --> 20:24.741
that's the best way
to trace an active call.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.265
See if he can get her
to arm the warheads.

20:27.317 --> 20:28.517
Why the hell would we do that?

20:28.542 --> 20:29.726
I know it sounds bad,

20:29.780 --> 20:31.481
but Lana's got the warheads already.

20:31.616 --> 20:33.619
Sooner as she arms them,
the better our shot

20:33.644 --> 20:35.392
at recovering them
before she gets a chance.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.795
Why trace a call to somewhere
they may or may not be

20:37.855 --> 20:39.423
when we can pinpoint them exactly

20:39.497 --> 20:41.421
using their active energy signature?

20:41.666 --> 20:44.968
Because tracing a call
doesn't arm a nuclear bomb.

20:45.422 --> 20:47.390
Yeah, we'll call that plan "B."

20:52.536 --> 20:54.571
Adam, we talked about this.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.647
You've broken our deal.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.316
I said I would call you
once I verified the codes.

20:59.344 --> 21:00.584
Well, what are you waiting for?

21:00.608 --> 21:02.052
I've done everything you asked.

21:02.206 --> 21:03.966
I asked you not to call me

21:03.991 --> 21:05.191
<i>and yet here we are!</i>

21:05.283 --> 21:06.884
Please, just let me talk to my son.

21:07.461 --> 21:09.793
Please, let me hear his voice.

21:11.162 --> 21:12.863
<i>Hold on.</i>

21:14.966 --> 21:16.366
<i>The codes work.</i>

21:16.524 --> 21:17.968
<i>You've been very helpful, Adam.</i>

21:18.022 --> 21:19.189
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:19.229 --> 21:20.612
Wait, wait, wait!

21:20.745 --> 21:22.539
Do you know how to arm the weapons?

21:22.607 --> 21:23.740
<i>Yes.</i>

21:23.808 --> 21:25.576
Well, what about my son? I don't...

21:25.643 --> 21:27.243
I don't want you
going back on your word

21:27.292 --> 21:29.460
if you try to arm them
and they don't work.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.915
Your son is fine.

21:32.173 --> 21:33.951
<i>I'll text you an address.</i>

21:34.193 --> 21:35.778
I pinpointed her in North America,

21:35.802 --> 21:37.400
but that's as far as
I'll get until I can

21:37.425 --> 21:39.060
rewrite my decryption program

21:39.100 --> 21:40.724
based on the signature of this call.

21:40.792 --> 21:43.360
The boy's at 5667 Douglas
Street, Tarrytown.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.128
- "Come alone."
- I'll ride with Zapata.

21:52.270 --> 21:55.049
-  What's going on with you and Jane?
- It's personal.

21:55.156 --> 21:57.373
If it makes a difference,
I'm not asking as your boss.

21:57.427 --> 22:00.220
You were my friend when I was
going through some hard times,

22:00.245 --> 22:02.446
so whatever's going on, I got you.

22:03.101 --> 22:04.790
Thanks, bud.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.400
I don't know where to start.

22:07.817 --> 22:10.485
Start at the end
and work your way back.

22:12.309 --> 22:14.143
I killed Jane's daughter.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.594
I don't know what to say.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.364
Neither do I.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.900
It feels like I'm in a dream.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.802
I can't look at him,
I can't be around him.

22:26.192 --> 22:28.305
Look, if you need to take some time...

22:28.373 --> 22:30.541
No, time won't fix this.

22:30.726 --> 22:32.441
My daughter is gone.

22:32.597 --> 22:35.198
I still don't even know
what she looked like.

22:36.213 --> 22:38.447
What was her name?

22:39.082 --> 22:41.217
Avery.

22:42.139 --> 22:44.040
That's beautiful.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.576
Okay, I've got the kid.

22:57.601 --> 22:59.503
One armed guard
on the far side of the house.

22:59.536 --> 23:01.234
None of them should be here, unless...

23:01.419 --> 23:02.560
Lana was planning to kill

23:02.585 --> 23:03.852
Adam and his son as
soon as he got here.

23:03.877 --> 23:05.698
Do you see Lana or the warhead?

23:05.757 --> 23:07.121
No.

23:07.425 --> 23:08.926
But the kid looks terrified.

23:09.186 --> 23:11.348
- I'm going in.
- No, Jane, wait for us.

23:11.373 --> 23:13.229
He's in danger, I'm going in now.

23:14.499 --> 23:16.200
Jane, wait!

23:30.035 --> 23:31.669
FBI!

23:31.823 --> 23:33.323
Uhh!

23:36.167 --> 23:37.200
Clear!

23:37.225 --> 23:38.322
What the hell were you thinking?

23:38.347 --> 23:40.352
I'm fine! He got me in the vest.

23:41.225 --> 23:43.389
I don't wanna lose you
because you're angry at me.

23:43.414 --> 23:45.148
Don't touch me!

23:45.250 --> 23:46.383
It'll be okay.

23:46.438 --> 23:47.438
Be okay.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.621
The authorities are involved

23:55.646 --> 23:57.480
earlier than expected.

23:58.735 --> 24:00.903
We strike sooner than planned.

24:02.128 --> 24:03.434
What else did we get from the raid?

24:03.459 --> 24:05.664
I'm running diagnostics
on all the encrypted phones

24:05.689 --> 24:07.105
and computers you brought back.

24:07.173 --> 24:09.634
Lana was using an encrypted
webcam to monitor the house.

24:09.659 --> 24:11.825
Likely, she and the warheads
were never there.

24:11.957 --> 24:14.534
If she wasn't onto us before,
she definitely is now.

24:21.891 --> 24:23.274
Hello.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.676
<i>This is Lana Stepulov
of the Dabbur Zann.</i>

24:25.701 --> 24:27.343
I want the agent in charge.

24:27.696 --> 24:30.231
This is Assistant Director
Reade with the FBI.

24:30.349 --> 24:32.918
Who else would be there
if warheads went missing?

24:33.732 --> 24:35.287
Is Mr. Keaton there?

24:35.934 --> 24:37.668
<i>I didn't see him at the raid,
but I've heard</i>

24:37.693 --> 24:39.771
<i>so much about him
from my brother Anton.</i>

24:39.921 --> 24:41.879
If you're trying to take
control of the Dabbur Zann,

24:41.903 --> 24:43.051
there's easier ways.

24:43.251 --> 24:44.509
Ah, Mr. Keaton,

24:44.577 --> 24:48.046
but stealing American nukes
is the most attention-grabbing.

24:48.472 --> 24:49.881
You have our attention.

24:50.679 --> 24:51.783
<i>Good.</i>

24:51.816 --> 24:54.752
I want my brother Anton released
from the CIA black site

24:54.806 --> 24:56.374
<i>where he's being held.</i>

24:56.488 --> 24:59.424
<i>I want all American
occupying forces out of Turkey.</i>

25:00.115 --> 25:02.127
<i>You have two hours. That is all.</i>

25:02.195 --> 25:03.361
The United States government

25:03.407 --> 25:05.074
does not negotiate with terrorists.

25:05.227 --> 25:07.202
<i>Your entire capitalist system is based</i>

25:07.227 --> 25:10.423
on negotiation and leverage
and getting what one wants

25:10.448 --> 25:11.770
<i>for the lowest cost.</i>

25:12.268 --> 25:16.174
I have the nukes.
You want to save lives.

25:16.564 --> 25:17.876
I'll call you back.

25:19.914 --> 25:21.214
Anything?

25:22.256 --> 25:24.224
The encryption is really good.

25:27.365 --> 25:28.611
Are you okay?

25:28.636 --> 25:29.851
I'll live.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.999
And you won't pull a
stunt like that again, right?

25:32.089 --> 25:33.967
Lana's bluffing.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.738
No one in their right mind uses a nuke.

25:35.763 --> 25:37.883
I would definitely not assume
she's in her right mind.

25:37.975 --> 25:39.800
What are we even doing in Turkey?

25:39.875 --> 25:41.175
What business do we have there?

25:41.263 --> 25:42.530
- Jane...
- What?

25:42.571 --> 25:43.637
Why do we always insist

25:43.662 --> 25:45.296
on messing around in people's lives?

25:45.420 --> 25:47.198
- This isn't about the troops.
- No, it's about

25:47.236 --> 25:49.206
interfering in matters
that don't concern us

25:49.231 --> 25:51.074
and killing people
who don't deserve to die.

25:51.099 --> 25:53.300
Stop! Focus for a second, okay?

25:53.428 --> 25:55.306
We're not gonna move the troops,
that isn't gonna happen.

25:55.331 --> 25:57.298
Lana must know that.
This has to be a ploy for her

25:57.323 --> 25:58.813
to get what she really
wants... her brother.

25:58.838 --> 26:01.431
You want to hand Anton Stepulov
back to the Dabbur Zann?

26:01.456 --> 26:02.767
We're not gonna
hand him over to anyone.

26:02.831 --> 26:04.315
We're just gonna buy
ourselves some time.

26:04.392 --> 26:05.496
Pull him out of the black site,

26:05.521 --> 26:07.027
put him on a runway,
make a big production

26:07.052 --> 26:09.175
out of the trade until
we can locate the warheads.

26:09.226 --> 26:10.944
Yeah, there's just one problem.

26:10.992 --> 26:13.027
Anton Stepulov is dead.

26:32.186 --> 26:34.626
Don't try anything.
I'll take the package.

26:34.782 --> 26:37.439
There are two snipers on you.
Make a move, you die.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.946
You're making a big mistake.

26:45.226 --> 26:48.895
7-S-W-R-7-1-9.

26:57.245 --> 26:59.671
You didn't think to tell us
Anton Stepulov was dead?

26:59.761 --> 27:01.862
Oh, I told you
as soon as it was relevant.

27:01.983 --> 27:03.417
- Did you know about this?
- No.

27:03.531 --> 27:05.800
I knew that Anton was
on the U.S.S. Ashland.

27:05.861 --> 27:08.195
It's a warship we use
as a secret floating prison.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.316
So how did Lana know?

27:09.358 --> 27:10.678
I'm looking into potential leaks.

27:10.714 --> 27:12.378
If there is one, I'll plug it.

27:12.434 --> 27:13.949
How did Anton die?

27:14.602 --> 27:17.139
His heart gave out
during an interrogation.

27:17.245 --> 27:19.212
He's buried at sea,
but no one knows that,

27:19.333 --> 27:20.962
so put a beard on a lookalike,

27:21.003 --> 27:23.705
put a bag on his head,
pull it up for a peek.

27:23.884 --> 27:25.919
From a distance, Lana'll never know.

27:26.506 --> 27:28.875
We've done it before. It works.

27:29.209 --> 27:31.644
I want to see that damn lookalike.

27:36.177 --> 27:38.781
Okay, I know this isn't an
ideal time to bring this up,

27:38.833 --> 27:40.513
but he's right about
slow rolling Crawford.

27:40.557 --> 27:41.722
You're absolutely right.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.011
This is not an ideal time
to bring this up.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.068
You're not seeing things clearly.

27:45.674 --> 27:47.308
Take Hirst out of it.

27:47.422 --> 27:49.590
You were close. She hurt you.

27:49.663 --> 27:51.926
Now you're trying to hurt
the guy who owns her.

27:52.074 --> 27:54.675
Reade, retaliation won't work here.

27:54.789 --> 27:56.657
This is chess, not boxing.

27:56.682 --> 27:58.202
And sometimes you can end a chess game

27:58.227 --> 28:00.231
- with a few quick moves.
- Not this one.

28:00.701 --> 28:02.014
You can't go right after the king.

28:02.039 --> 28:04.154
You have to take out
the pieces that protect him.

28:04.179 --> 28:06.113
You know what? I don't trust Keaton.

28:06.234 --> 28:08.902
He always has an angle, and I
don't like his methods, okay?

28:09.083 --> 28:11.251
Do you trust me?

28:11.907 --> 28:13.127
With my life.

28:13.227 --> 28:14.795
Then think about it.

28:17.699 --> 28:19.433
Here, Patterson.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.592
Can we trace it this time?

28:20.617 --> 28:22.313
I rewrote my decryption program,

28:22.363 --> 28:25.098
but there's no guarantee.

28:26.113 --> 28:27.356
Lana, you're on with...

28:27.381 --> 28:28.981
<i>What have you decided, Mr. Keaton?</i>

28:29.083 --> 28:30.788
We're moving the troops to Greece.

28:30.849 --> 28:32.289
The joint chiefs and the White House

28:32.333 --> 28:33.778
are drafting orders as we speak.

28:33.803 --> 28:36.051
It will take time, but it's happening.

28:36.076 --> 28:38.360
I must say, I wasn't expecting that.

28:38.745 --> 28:41.013
I thought I'd have to play hardball.

28:41.409 --> 28:43.684
In the meantime,
as a show of good faith,

28:43.751 --> 28:45.751
we'll move your brother to an airport.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.634
We'll trade him
for one of the warheads.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.994
Now, Lana, that is a very fair deal.

28:50.358 --> 28:54.266
Indeed. Except I already know
my brother Anton is dead,

28:55.453 --> 28:57.978
<i>which means you were never
planning to move the troops</i>

28:58.086 --> 29:00.654
<i>and you're not taking me seriously.</i>

29:01.948 --> 29:03.823
But you will soon.

29:04.125 --> 29:06.660
Did she hang up? She's still on
the line, but we're on hold.

29:09.638 --> 29:10.905
She's in New York.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.130
City or state?

29:12.186 --> 29:14.005
State. Possibly city. It's working,

29:14.030 --> 29:15.631
but I need just a little bit more time.

29:15.697 --> 29:17.464
One of the warheads just got armed.

29:17.559 --> 29:19.126
- You sure about that?
- Very.

29:19.151 --> 29:20.218
Is that New York?

29:20.243 --> 29:21.844
No, it's moving over the South Pacific.

29:21.869 --> 29:23.895
Is she in the South
Pacific or New York?

29:24.002 --> 29:25.114
No... I don't know.

29:25.139 --> 29:26.538
One of the bombs
is in the South Pacific.

29:26.563 --> 29:28.130
That's all we know.

29:35.197 --> 29:36.691
Oh, my God.

29:38.126 --> 29:40.187
Did... Did that just g...

29:40.212 --> 29:41.245
How many dead?

29:41.696 --> 29:43.189
That's an uninhabited island.

29:43.241 --> 29:44.382
No one lives anywhere close.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.967
There shouldn't be
any human casualties.

29:46.148 --> 29:48.300
- He's right.
- That was a warning shot.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.567
<i>Unlike you, I do what I promise.</i>

29:50.845 --> 29:52.779
Move the troops,

29:52.960 --> 29:55.528
or the next warhead
goes off in New York.

30:15.459 --> 30:16.926
Aah!

30:24.763 --> 30:26.469
I believe this is mine.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.964
This is very simple.

30:37.237 --> 30:39.844
I ask a question,
you answer truthfully,

30:39.912 --> 30:41.879
or we find out if you can
breathe underwater.

30:42.433 --> 30:44.215
But we both know
you're gonna waste time

30:44.240 --> 30:45.349
begging for your life.

30:50.214 --> 30:53.077
And then you're gonna say
that you don't know anything.

30:56.728 --> 30:58.329
But now we've got that out of the way,

30:58.397 --> 31:00.097
we can get to the truth.

31:00.857 --> 31:02.800
Choose your next words very carefully.

31:03.059 --> 31:05.957
Who hired you to steal the package?

31:06.817 --> 31:07.884
Victor.

31:07.919 --> 31:10.087
I'm Victor, Crawford's
VP of Operations.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.642
Victor hired you?

31:12.667 --> 31:14.534
The guy I was with earlier?

31:14.618 --> 31:16.566
I swear.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.530
It was Victor.

31:27.181 --> 31:28.331
Confirmation is in.

31:28.356 --> 31:30.023
Zero casualties, zero witnesses.

31:30.161 --> 31:32.329
We got lucky. I feel pretty lucky.

31:32.370 --> 31:33.894
But let me remind you that the warhead

31:33.919 --> 31:36.220
that Lana just detonated
was the smaller of the two.

31:36.284 --> 31:38.451
- No one forgot that, Dave.
- Fine.

31:38.970 --> 31:40.449
I'm just saying that
the other one she has left

31:40.474 --> 31:42.813
- will level New York.
- Not if we find her first.

31:43.154 --> 31:44.588
Good plan. How?

31:44.803 --> 31:46.175
We know that Lana has a plane.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.245
It's the only way she could have gotten

31:47.270 --> 31:48.714
the first nuke out
to the South Pacific.

31:48.860 --> 31:49.909
And we know she wasn't on it.

31:49.934 --> 31:51.745
Patterson's phone trace
put her in New York.

31:51.770 --> 31:52.936
Right, so if the second nuke

31:52.961 --> 31:54.074
is gonna detonate here,

31:54.099 --> 31:55.099
she needs an escape.

31:55.124 --> 31:56.379
She must have a second plane.

31:56.404 --> 31:57.891
If she does, we can track it.

31:58.156 --> 31:59.890
Again, how?

32:00.045 --> 32:02.099
Deductive reasoning, math, a little bit

32:02.124 --> 32:03.592
of that luck you love so much.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.595
The plane has to be big enough
to carry Lana's crew

32:05.620 --> 32:07.440
- and the warhead.
- And be able to fly

32:07.465 --> 32:09.572
high enough and fast enough
to get out of the blast zone.

32:09.597 --> 32:11.818
I'm searching private airports
for charter planes

32:11.843 --> 32:13.844
that have landed in New York
in the last few...

32:13.869 --> 32:16.604
Wait, you think she's
gonna file a flight plan

32:16.648 --> 32:18.549
to drop a nuclear warhead
on New York City?

32:18.583 --> 32:20.551
Not on her way out, but there's no way

32:20.583 --> 32:22.195
she could have landed two huge planes

32:22.220 --> 32:23.930
on her way in without one.

32:23.996 --> 32:26.733
How many charters have landed
recently with no plans to leave?

32:26.758 --> 32:28.025
A few more than I'd like,

32:28.050 --> 32:30.166
but there's a C-123 cargo plane

32:30.191 --> 32:31.892
at Farmingdale Airport on Long Island.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.117
You sure that's it?

32:33.144 --> 32:34.711
91% sure.

32:34.813 --> 32:37.081
It meets all the criteria,
and it's Russian-made.

32:37.161 --> 32:39.096
You have to subtract
the 9% on account of,

32:39.121 --> 32:40.265
just, like, so many other things...

32:40.319 --> 32:42.353
All right, we got it.
We got it, let's go.

32:52.383 --> 32:53.623
Patterson, we're in the hangar.

32:53.648 --> 32:55.249
- Are the warheads in here?
- I don't know.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.168
If the warhead isn't armed,
there's no way to tell.

32:57.193 --> 32:59.239
All right, let's split up
and find that nuke.

32:59.264 --> 33:01.799
I'm gonna search the other
hangar for the cargo plane.

33:06.444 --> 33:09.980
Okay, so I've got the specs
for the warhead in front of me.

33:10.108 --> 33:13.577
It can be armed via the weapon
itself or with a remote.

33:13.684 --> 33:15.364
You need to recover
the remote and the nuke

33:15.399 --> 33:17.467
<i>to neutralize the threat.</i>

33:22.174 --> 33:23.340
Clear.

33:24.690 --> 33:25.856
Where's Weller?

33:26.724 --> 33:28.024
I...

33:28.479 --> 33:30.314
Uh, good news, bad news.

33:30.488 --> 33:32.934
The warhead just got armed,
and it's moving fast.

33:32.998 --> 33:34.238
<i>Pretty sure it's on that plane.</i>

33:34.263 --> 33:35.674
How is any of that good news?

33:35.759 --> 33:37.560
<i>'Cause I got eyes on a GPS tracker.</i>

33:37.682 --> 33:39.716
Pretty sure I know where Weller is.

33:49.866 --> 33:50.905
All right.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.562
Patterson, I found the warhead.

33:53.711 --> 33:54.944
How do I disarm it?

33:54.989 --> 33:57.457
Uh, use the Category D
Permission Action Link,

33:57.535 --> 33:58.969
hit the disarm button.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.771
What, that's it?

34:01.062 --> 34:02.903
I mean, yeah. They're our nukes.

34:02.928 --> 34:04.256
It's not like he has to cut a wire.

34:04.281 --> 34:05.732
Patterson! Give me an answer!

34:05.784 --> 34:07.314
No, he's right, just punch in

34:07.339 --> 34:09.882
the six-digit PAL code
Adam stole for Lana...

34:09.940 --> 34:13.070
6-4-0-7-1-4 and hit "disable."
That should do it.

34:14.371 --> 34:15.371
Done!

34:16.702 --> 34:17.835
Agh!

34:18.050 --> 34:19.092
What was that?

34:20.777 --> 34:22.411
<i>Lana's on the plane!</i>

34:22.806 --> 34:23.841
<i>She's got a chute on!</i>

34:23.867 --> 34:25.467
No, that doesn't make any sense.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.496
She's not gonna jump
into the blast zone.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.324
Patterson! The
cargo bay door is opening!

34:34.659 --> 34:36.248
Hack into that plane!
I need you to close it!

34:36.274 --> 34:38.471
I'm trying to connect,
but it's a military plane.

34:38.496 --> 34:40.377
It's all encrypted,
and it's all in Russian.

34:48.193 --> 34:50.034
Whoa. Weller, the warhead

34:50.059 --> 34:51.617
just changed directions dramatically.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.493
It's in freefall right over Manhattan.

34:53.518 --> 34:54.821
<i>She's released the bomb!</i>

34:54.859 --> 34:56.610
And as long as it's not
armed when it falls,

34:56.636 --> 34:58.685
<i>it's not going to explode on impact.</i>

35:02.200 --> 35:04.201
You can't see this,
but the bomb just got armed.

35:24.286 --> 35:26.554
Lana's dead! She fell out of the plane!

35:26.663 --> 35:27.930
Where's the remote?

35:27.997 --> 35:29.300
It's on her wrist!

35:29.345 --> 35:30.799
There's only one way
to disarm that bomb.

35:30.836 --> 35:32.143
You gotta jump!

35:32.168 --> 35:34.558
Oh, he for sure already
jumped out of that plane.

35:44.841 --> 35:46.775
<i>Okay, you need to catch up to Lana</i>

35:46.850 --> 35:48.960
<i>and use her remote
to disarm the warhead.</i>

35:49.032 --> 35:51.562
You have about 30 seconds
until it hits the ground.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.260
We need to scramble fighter jets
to intercept that plane.

35:55.290 --> 35:58.225
We're already on it. They're
T-minus three minutes 40 seconds.

35:58.461 --> 36:00.750
That is why Lana put on the parachute.

36:00.803 --> 36:02.570
In case we shoot her down.

36:07.470 --> 36:09.426
<i>15...</i>

36:09.499 --> 36:10.766
<i>14...</i>

36:11.027 --> 36:12.594
<i>13...</i>

36:12.842 --> 36:14.242
<i>12...</i>

36:14.596 --> 36:16.344
<i>11...</i>

36:16.425 --> 36:17.559
<i>10...</i>

36:23.539 --> 36:25.940
Weller, the warhead just
disappeared from our screens.

36:26.289 --> 36:28.624
It's disarmed. We're in the clear.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.734
<i>It landed in the Hudson.</i>

36:38.210 --> 36:40.378
You did it.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.714
You just saved millions of lives.

36:45.615 --> 36:46.982
- Oh, Dave, no.
- Oh.

36:47.986 --> 36:49.278
<i>Weller...</i>

36:49.545 --> 36:51.880
<i>Are you okay?</i>

37:00.793 --> 37:04.026
Ah, there he is, fresh from the sky.

37:04.093 --> 37:05.127
Very cool.

37:05.194 --> 37:06.361
Where's Jane?

37:06.572 --> 37:08.005
She had to go home.

37:08.044 --> 37:09.678
She's not feeling well.

37:10.404 --> 37:11.776
Well, here's hoping you guys are around

37:11.801 --> 37:13.254
the next time something
like this happens.

37:13.279 --> 37:14.846
What do you mean "next time"?

37:15.071 --> 37:16.678
It's not the first time
the Department of Energy

37:16.703 --> 37:18.649
has misplaced a nuke,
and I can promise you,

37:18.674 --> 37:20.475
it won't be the last.

37:20.569 --> 37:22.520
Silver lining... maybe
after today's events,

37:22.545 --> 37:24.118
they'll get a bit more
budget and we can work on

37:24.143 --> 37:27.377
some nuclear security,
but that's a big maybe.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.917
All right.

37:29.719 --> 37:30.919
See ya.

37:32.221 --> 37:33.221
Bye, Dave.

37:33.457 --> 37:34.590
What an idiot.

37:34.657 --> 37:36.918
Okay. One last thing.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.220
We still have the big picture
to deal with.

37:42.423 --> 37:44.399
As much as I want to take
Crawford down now,

37:44.451 --> 37:45.493
we're still not at checkmate,

37:45.535 --> 37:47.636
so we'll use the long game.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.853
We'll use the tattoos
to take all of his pieces

37:49.878 --> 37:52.085
off the board while he still
doesn't know what's happening,

37:52.154 --> 37:54.146
force him into a corner...
He'll make some mistakes,

37:54.171 --> 37:56.364
and we can take him
and Roman down together.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.132
Sounds like a plan.

38:06.663 --> 38:08.824
Nice work on Reade.

38:09.146 --> 38:11.193
I knew you'd convince him
to see things our way.

38:11.665 --> 38:13.595
Didn't take much convincing.

38:13.863 --> 38:15.964
Just had to hear it from a friend.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.368
You know, there will come a day

38:19.435 --> 38:21.737
when our interests
won't align with theirs.

38:22.116 --> 38:24.740
Playing peacemaker won't be possible.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.942
You'll need to pick a side.

38:28.511 --> 38:31.793
I picked a side when I left the FBI.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.336
I'm with you all the way.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.663
You look like hell.

38:47.730 --> 38:49.342
Yeah, I had a hell of a day.

38:49.388 --> 38:50.666
Hmm.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.624
Those guys that were following us,

38:58.649 --> 38:59.769
you must have lost 'em, huh?

38:59.793 --> 39:01.524
Yeah, I lost 'em in the bazaar.

39:01.592 --> 39:04.393
Well, they found me.

39:04.461 --> 39:06.959
Stole the package and sped off.

39:07.372 --> 39:08.983
Well...

39:09.032 --> 39:11.334
Luckily, I memorized the license plate,

39:11.401 --> 39:14.203
popped back here, checked
the CCTV footage in the area.

39:14.557 --> 39:16.639
Hope you don't mind,
I borrowed your laptop.

39:16.707 --> 39:17.940
It's password protected.

39:18.008 --> 39:19.728
Yeah, you'll definitely
need to change that.

39:19.752 --> 39:21.175
I can show you how if you want.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.469
Anyway, I tracked the car.

39:24.714 --> 39:27.115
- A lot of trouble for a little coin.
- Hmm.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.258
Why does Crawford want it so bad?

39:30.293 --> 39:31.460
He doesn't.

39:31.722 --> 39:33.890
- It's a gift for someone.
- Who?

39:35.125 --> 39:37.092
Should I call Crawford and ask him?

39:37.219 --> 39:38.803
You know, I'm sure
he'd be relieved to hear

39:38.828 --> 39:41.096
how I got it back after you lost it.

39:42.372 --> 39:43.805
It's a gift for a collector

39:43.830 --> 39:45.214
that he's trying to close a deal with.

39:45.457 --> 39:46.569
And...

39:46.858 --> 39:48.959
This little coin is worth $4 million

39:48.984 --> 39:52.475
on the open market,
but if it closes the deal,

39:52.702 --> 39:53.974
it's worth 30 billion.

39:53.999 --> 39:54.999
What's he buying?

39:55.172 --> 39:57.807
Something unbuyable.

39:58.709 --> 40:01.150
So it would have been bad
if I lost that coin?

40:01.504 --> 40:03.405
Very bad.

40:13.177 --> 40:14.864
I didn't know if you'd be here.

40:15.324 --> 40:19.669
I was... hoping we could talk.

40:21.772 --> 40:25.875
Nothing that you could
say would fix this.

40:28.280 --> 40:31.080
I've never seen my daughter's face,

40:31.377 --> 40:36.313
and all I can picture
is... you killing her.

40:36.807 --> 40:39.789
That's all I can see, too.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.430
It's all I've seen for months.

40:41.565 --> 40:44.175
And all you did was lie.

40:44.474 --> 40:47.876
'Cause I knew if I told you,
that would end us.

40:50.253 --> 40:52.087
I don't want to lose you again.

40:53.443 --> 40:55.444
The first time, it nearly killed me,

40:55.882 --> 40:58.307
and, Jane, I know this was selfish.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.623
- I know it was cowardly.
- I'm leaving.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.946
Okay. Just...

41:04.378 --> 41:06.582
Take all the time that you need.

41:06.886 --> 41:09.018
- When you're ready, we can
- No.

41:09.439 --> 41:11.406
I am leaving you.
