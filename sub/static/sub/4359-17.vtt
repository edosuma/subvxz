Hey, Alex, what are you
still doing here?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.480
I thought you were going
to the movies.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.640
I am, but Annie's late.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.760
Annie, we have to leave,
like, right now

01:15.760 --> 01:17.840
or else wait
until the next showing.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.080
I can't go to the movies.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.360
I have so much work

01:20.360 --> 01:21.920
then I'm going to Bryce's
for dinner.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.720
Bryce's? That's not fair,
you said you'd go with me.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.240
<i>Why don't you cancel on him?</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:28.080
I can't. He really
wants me to meet

01:28.080 --> 01:29.720
his sister who's in
from college

01:29.720 --> 01:31.800
and if I don't go,
I'll never meet her.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.520
Sorry.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.920
That's great, Alex.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.440
Don't be a brat, let me go.

Hey!

01:46.640 --> 01:47.760
Can you believe that?

01:47.760 --> 01:49.640
First she's late,
then she cancels on me.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.400
I'm sorry, honey, but I only
have a little work left

01:52.400 --> 01:53.920
and then I can go with you.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.360
That's okay, Mom, forget it.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.280
Look, your sister's
very busy right now

01:57.280 --> 01:58.520
her life is changing.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.680
You'll just have to
get used to it, I'm afraid.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.240
Yeah, but we used to
do stuff together.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.000
Now she acts like I'm just
in the way.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.280
Oh, that's not true.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.919
Yes, it is.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.560
<i>( Bubbling )</i>

02:18.600 --> 02:20.320
So, what you're telling me

02:20.320 --> 02:22.800
is if this substance
you've developed

02:22.800 --> 02:24.720
comes in contact with GC-161

02:24.720 --> 02:27.240
or anything containing
its properties

02:27.240 --> 02:28.760
it will react strongly?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.760
Let me show you.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.600
<i>( Sizzling )</i>

02:41.600 --> 02:43.520
Excellent!

02:43.520 --> 02:45.440
Excellent work!

02:45.440 --> 02:46.560
Thank you.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.840
Uh, though I still
don't quite understand

02:48.840 --> 02:50.360
why you wanted me
to develop

02:50.360 --> 02:52.160
something like this,
Miss Atron.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.400
You know, George

02:53.400 --> 02:55.800
I plan to eventually
fill you in

02:55.800 --> 02:58.960
on all of our long-range
plans for GC-161

02:58.960 --> 03:00.880
but not yet, so,
drop it.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.080
Oh, and I'd like for you
to prepare for me

03:03.080 --> 03:04.800
a large amount
of the sample, say

03:04.800 --> 03:07.240
a liter, and have it
delivered to my office

03:07.240 --> 03:09.000
first thing tomorrow.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.280
<i>( Keys jingling )</i>

03:16.280 --> 03:18.200
Okay, I'm leaving.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.960
I'll be back by 11:00.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.080
Yes, you will.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.040
<i>( Laughing )</i>

03:22.040 --> 03:23.160
Have a great time.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.080
Oh! I forgot
to tell you girls

03:25.080 --> 03:28.000
the Plant Carnival
is the day after tomorrow.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.960
Oh, cool.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.000
We can go after school.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.920
I think
I've outgrown the cotton candy

03:32.920 --> 03:34.080
and the Ferris wheels.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.600
Come on, Annie,
we go together every year.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.680
Not this year, Alex.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.320
I'm sure you and your friends

03:39.320 --> 03:42.400
will have a better time
without me. See you.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.600
Mack's amazing.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.280
Without even realizing it

03:53.280 --> 03:55.720
he has given us
the greatest tool yet

03:55.720 --> 03:57.040
for finding the kid.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.760
Considering up till now
our best tool was Dave

03:59.760 --> 04:01.040
that's not surprising.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.320
Thanks, Vince.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.560
<i>( Sighs )</i>

04:04.560 --> 04:07.480
The most obvious place
to use this substance

04:07.480 --> 04:09.200
is at the Plant Carnival.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.280
<i>I love a carnival.</i>

04:11.280 --> 04:12.600
What did you have in mind?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.680
Maybe taking him
out back, getting

04:14.680 --> 04:16.560
some honey
and red ants...

04:16.560 --> 04:17.640
I mean the carnival.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.640
What does every kid

04:18.640 --> 04:20.040
coming to
the carnival need?

04:20.040 --> 04:22.040
A passion for fun?

04:22.680 --> 04:23.800
A ticket.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.000
We coat each ticket
with this substance

04:26.000 --> 04:27.160
seal the exits

04:27.160 --> 04:29.360
and sit back and wait
for the results.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.160
I love it.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.880
<i>( Sizzling )</i>

04:35.880 --> 04:38.600
<i>( Laughs )</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:42.880
So tonight is definitely
out of the question?

04:42.880 --> 04:45.800
Bryce, I can't just completely
abandon my school work.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.840
Well, one night off

04:46.840 --> 04:48.560
isn't exactly
abandonment, Annie.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.000
I mean,
I thought you decided

04:50.000 --> 04:52.160
you were going to live
in the real world

04:52.160 --> 04:53.080
a little more.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.200
Very funny.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.240
What about tomorrow?

04:55.240 --> 04:57.040
Tomorrow I'm doing
this magic show

04:57.040 --> 04:58.200
at the Plant Carnival.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
I do it every year.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.080
Oh, hey, why don't
you help me out?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.640
I can use an assistant.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.200
You don't exactly strike me
as the magic show type.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.960
Well, no, I mean,
it's pretty cool.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.080
I don't wear a top hat
or sparkly jacket.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.280
I don't know anything
about magic, Bryce.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.880
Somehow, I knew that.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.000
Well, don't worry

05:14.000 --> 05:16.200
I promise you, you'll
have a great time

05:16.200 --> 05:18.520
and if you really hate it,
then I promise

05:18.520 --> 05:20.480
that I'll join you
at one of those

05:20.480 --> 05:22.240
laugh-a-minute
physics seminars

05:22.240 --> 05:24.280
that you go to.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.360
So will you do it?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.120
I guess it won't kill me.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.120
Probably not.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.480
<i>( Door opening )</i>

05:31.840 --> 05:32.760
Hey, Alex.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.360
You don't say hello?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.320
Hey.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.280
Did you know

05:36.280 --> 05:37.720
your sister is about
to enter

05:37.720 --> 05:39.160
a new career?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.520
She's working with me

05:40.520 --> 05:41.480
at the carnival--

05:41.480 --> 05:42.760
come see her
in action.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.040
You're going to the carnival
with Bryce?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
Uh, yeah.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.440
I-- just... to help
him out, to work.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.880
Well, it's not
really work, I mean...

05:51.880 --> 05:53.200
Do me a favor, Annie

05:53.200 --> 05:55.640
just don't talk to me anymore,
okay?

05:57.360 --> 05:59.280
What's she so mad about?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.200
I'm not mad.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.040
You wanted me immediately,
Miss Atron?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.200
Vince.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.280
I was just telling
Mr. Lawless here

06:09.280 --> 06:11.520
how delighted we are
to have a visitor

06:11.520 --> 06:13.280
from the federal
government.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.880
<i> What are you doing here?</i>

06:14.880 --> 06:17.080
When I fired you,
I meant it, Gino.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.400
That's inspector
Gino Wallace

U.S. government
special investigator

06:23.400 --> 06:24.480
What?

06:24.480 --> 06:27.760
Vince, you obviously
know this man?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.440
Yeah, he knows me,
and you should, too.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.320
I worked for Vince
in his security force.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.480
Worst job I ever had.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.080
Every day,
he found a new way

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
to humiliate us.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.960
Aw, you just couldn't
take the heat, Gino.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.640
You're a sick person, Vince.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.640
I feel sorry for you,
I really do.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.800
But I knew one day
I'd get my revenge.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.760
And here I am

06:46.760 --> 06:48.840
with Uncle Sam
backing me up.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.040
Well, I don't care
who you work for--

06:51.040 --> 06:54.360
you can't just bust in here
and make false accusations.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.040
I remember what goes on here.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.760
The secret
midnight deliveries

06:57.760 --> 06:59.640
the hush-hush
chemical research.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.200
You think you're playing
with children here?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.080
You have some
imagination, Gino.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.400
This is the safest

07:05.400 --> 07:08.280
most law-abiding chemical
plant in the country.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.080
We'll see about that, Vince.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.720
I'm going through this place
inch by inch.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.080
And if I find so much
as a dirty cup

07:15.080 --> 07:16.560
I'll burn you so bad

07:16.560 --> 07:17.960
your teeth will melt.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.240
Mmm...

07:19.240 --> 07:21.960
You'll need an official

07:21.960 --> 07:23.920
inspection notice,
Lawless.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.200
Oh, I have one, Vince.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.760
Here's your 24-hour notice.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.920
See you in the morning.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.920
<i>( Door closes )</i>

07:33.920 --> 07:36.720
Vince, I need you to hide
not only all GC-161

07:36.720 --> 07:38.920
but all research
pertaining to it.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.920
If he finds anything,
we're sunk.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.440
I'm on it.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.960
Yes, ma'am.

Mm-hmm.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.760
So all of a sudden

08:00.760 --> 08:03.640
Annie's, like,
married to him.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.040
Kind of sounds like
you're jealous, Alex.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.280
Yeah, I thought
you said

08:07.280 --> 08:09.080
you kind of liked
this Bryce guy.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.320
I did--
I mean, I do.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.760
Ray: Face it,
you're just mad

08:12.760 --> 08:14.760
because Annie didn't go
to the carnival

08:14.760 --> 08:15.800
with you this year.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.240
That's not it...

08:17.240 --> 08:18.360
Completely.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.200
Wouldn't you much
rather go with us?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.720
I mean, we're
so much more...

08:21.720 --> 08:23.000
Annoying?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.280
That wasn't the word

08:24.280 --> 08:26.200
I was looking for.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.320
Look, Alex

08:27.320 --> 08:29.200
imagine if you had
a little sister.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.080
You wouldn't want her
tagging along with us

08:32.080 --> 08:33.280
would you?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.120
Wow! Bryce,
this is incredible.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.680
Who designed it?

08:51.680 --> 08:53.280
Well, who do you think?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.040
You did?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.720
It's amazing.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
I never knew
you were so creative.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.600
You never asked.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.480
So do you
want me to do?

09:02.480 --> 09:04.400
Wear a top hat
and a sparkly jacket

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
and hand me props

09:05.400 --> 09:06.680
when I need them.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.800
Excuse me?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.080
I'm just kidding.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.560
I just have to teach you
the tricks I'll be doing

09:11.560 --> 09:14.080
and you'll help me
in setting up the illusion.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.640
So you're in?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.880
For you? Maybe.

09:17.880 --> 09:18.960
Great.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
Now, there's really
only five tricks

09:20.960 --> 09:23.120
that magicians use
over and over again

09:23.120 --> 09:24.200
in different ways.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.640
Watch.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.840
See this hat?

09:26.840 --> 09:28.400
It's empty, right?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.640
<i>( Laughs softly )</i>

09:48.360 --> 09:50.040
Ray: I don't know
about you guys

09:50.040 --> 09:51.680
but I planned this
just right.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.720
I haven't had a bite
to eat all day.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.160
My body is prepared

09:55.160 --> 09:57.720
for a massive influx
of junk food.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.600
Maybe you should
think twice, Ray.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.720
I mean, what is junk
food filled with?

10:01.720 --> 10:02.680
Chemicals.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.040
We're going
to a carnival

10:04.040 --> 10:05.600
hosted by
a Chemical Plant.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.480
Imagine what's
in their hot dogs.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.400
Nicole, you make
chemicals sound

10:09.400 --> 10:11.000
like a bad thing.

10:11.000 --> 10:11.960
Yeah.

10:11.960 --> 10:12.920
Ho, ho, ho!

10:12.920 --> 10:14.280
Here you go, kiddies.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.840
This ticket is your pass
to all the fun

10:16.840 --> 10:19.280
that the P.V.C.P. Carnival
has to offer.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.680
You need to
keep the tickets

10:20.680 --> 10:21.960
on you at all
times. Why?

10:21.960 --> 10:24.440
'Cause Miss Atron will announce
the raffle winner.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.520
And your
ticket number

10:25.520 --> 10:26.920
is your raffle number.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.680
Like we really have a chance
to win.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.640
The number will be picked at
random-- everybody has a chance.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.960
Oh, yeah, right.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.720
You want to bet the winner
is the kid of some

10:35.720 --> 10:37.800
big financial
contributor to the Plant?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.040
Hey, are you okay?

10:44.040 --> 10:45.320
You look really pale.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.440
To be honest, no.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.680
I'm starting to feel
a little nauseous.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.120
That veggie-burger
I had is talking to me

10:51.120 --> 10:52.360
and it's not happy.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.240
Maybe we should just
cancel the show.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.680
Well, we can't cancel now.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.600
I don't get donations
until the end.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.520
I'm, I'm pretty sure
I can make it.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.800
Pretty sure?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.200
Well, yeah,
and if I can't

11:02.200 --> 11:04.320
then, uh, you could do
the show, Annie.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.680
Oh! No, I can't, Bryce.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.760
<i>( Laughs nervously )</i>

11:06.760 --> 11:08.640
Sure you can,
you learned everything.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.080
You know it
as well as I do.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.160
Bryce, I beg you,
don't do that to me.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.160
<i>( Stomach churning )</i>

11:15.640 --> 11:16.880
<i>( Camera clicking )</i>

11:16.880 --> 11:19.080
We thoroughly appreciate
the government's concern

11:19.080 --> 11:20.480
regarding safety,
Mr. Lawless.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.160
Lay off the sell job,
Miss Atron.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.600
The only thing
you appreciate

11:23.600 --> 11:24.800
is your profit margin.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.320
My, you certainly
seem to have

11:26.320 --> 11:27.560
a chip on your shoulder

11:27.560 --> 11:29.480
when it comes to
your experience here.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.480
I understand that Vince
was probably a tough man...

11:32.480 --> 11:33.440
Vince, Miss Atron

11:33.440 --> 11:35.120
is not only
sadistic and cruel

11:35.120 --> 11:36.160
but I have no doubt

11:36.160 --> 11:37.840
he is engaged
in highly illegal

11:37.840 --> 11:39.160
and unethical practices

11:39.160 --> 11:41.520
in the guise of being
your security chief.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.560
Tell me, why would

11:42.560 --> 11:44.280
the C.E.O.
of a Chemical Plant

11:44.280 --> 11:46.960
need such a highly-trained
ex-C.I.A. Operative

11:46.960 --> 11:48.280
to protect her?

11:49.560 --> 11:51.960
Perhaps we should
finish the tour.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.400
<i>( Cheering )</i>

12:02.680 --> 12:04.520
I'm sorry, Annie.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.640
I got to stop.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.760
Bryce, don't
do this to me!

12:07.760 --> 12:09.440
<i>( Gurgling )</i>

12:16.440 --> 12:17.640
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

12:17.640 --> 12:19.200
Dave:
Hey, Vince.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.200
Vince?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.080
Is it legal to
block off the exits

12:22.080 --> 12:23.560
and not let
anybody leave?

12:23.560 --> 12:24.960
Dave, you worry too much.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.400
I mean,
about what's legal

12:26.400 --> 12:27.360
what's not legal.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.840
Besides, we're
not preventing

12:28.840 --> 12:29.920
anyone from leaving

12:29.920 --> 12:32.040
we're just delaying
their departures.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.840
<i>( Bell rings )</i>

12:34.840 --> 12:36.040
Mmm!

12:37.000 --> 12:38.320
You want some
cotton candy?

12:38.320 --> 12:39.960
I can get us
some cotton candy.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.120
Just... keep your
eyes out, Dave.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
If that substance
is working

12:45.120 --> 12:46.440
like I hope it is

12:46.440 --> 12:48.840
there might be
some kid out here

12:48.840 --> 12:50.640
who wishes he--
or she--

12:50.640 --> 12:53.640
hadn't come out
to the carnival today.

12:55.800 --> 12:56.680
You know what?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.160
You guys should
really lay off

12:58.160 --> 12:59.120
the food a little.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.520
Come on,
don't be so boring.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.800
You know
you want a bite.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.640
Louis, get that
thing away from me.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.600
One bite of that

13:04.600 --> 13:06.080
and my whole
digestive system

13:06.080 --> 13:07.200
will be ruined.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.080
So, which ride should
we go on first?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.600
<i>( Kids screaming )</i>

13:11.600 --> 13:12.560
Well, how about

13:12.560 --> 13:14.000
we give Louis
three hot dogs

13:14.000 --> 13:15.880
then send him up
on the Ferris wheel

13:15.880 --> 13:17.080
and watch
what happens?

<i>( Chuckles )</i>

13:18.000 --> 13:19.040
Cool!

13:21.120 --> 13:22.480
What's the matter?

13:22.480 --> 13:25.360
Alex, I think you
better go find a mirror.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.280
What for?

13:26.280 --> 13:27.400
Cover your face

13:27.400 --> 13:29.320
and go look in
the mirror.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.640
Okay.

Good.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.680
How about you?

14:31.680 --> 14:34.040
Did you eat
too much candy?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.160
How about you?

14:35.160 --> 14:37.560
Go on a lot
of rides?

<i>( Humming )</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:42.920

14:42.920 --> 14:44.880
And what areas
has your research

14:44.880 --> 14:46.320
been focused on, Mack?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.720
My work has concentrated
specifically

14:48.720 --> 14:51.360
on the analysis of
various new compounds

14:51.360 --> 14:53.720
and their corresponding
mechanisms.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.000
I also do some work

14:55.000 --> 14:57.200
on recombinant
DNA formations

14:57.200 --> 14:59.120
also known as gene-splicing.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.920
Isn't some DNA testing
prohibited by law?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.240
<i>Nothing we deal with
is illegal, sir.</i>

15:04.240 --> 15:07.040
And everything pertaining
to Mr. Mack's work

15:07.040 --> 15:08.880
is included
in those reports

15:08.880 --> 15:11.320
I had drawn up
specifically for you.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.840
Those reports are
garbage, Miss Atron.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.520
You know it
and I know it.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.840
You'll just have to prove
that then, won't you?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.280
Don't leave town, Mack.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.640
I may need to speak
with you later.

some more food.

his GC-161 detector

20:14.680 --> 20:16.280
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.920
This is the kind of thing
I have been looking for.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.200
Excuse me?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.680
Slippery sidewalks,
uneven concrete--

20:24.680 --> 20:27.600
we got safety violations
up the wazoo here.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.840
Oh, what a shame.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.920
I wish your boy
Vince could be here.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.160
This will cost you
some serious bucks.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.600
Not the big-ticket item
I was looking for

20:35.600 --> 20:38.240
but there's plenty
of time for that.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.400
Mm-mm-mm.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.760
What happened
to you?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.000
I don't know.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.720
When did you start
feeling weird?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.360
After entering the carnival.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.640
Did you eat
something?

20:51.640 --> 20:52.560
No.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.600
Did they give
you anything

20:54.600 --> 20:56.440
a prize,
something free?

20:56.440 --> 20:57.120
Think.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.160
Those cheapskates didn't
give us anything

21:01.160 --> 21:02.920
but a raffle ticket.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.480
What was that?

21:31.480 --> 21:34.080
The Chemical Plant
probably coated these

21:34.080 --> 21:37.040
with some substance
that reacts with GC-161.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.400
No wonder they told us
to hold on to them.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.040
Thanks, Annie.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.200
Thank you for saving me
at the show.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.920
Ray: And now
that that's over

21:44.920 --> 21:46.960
I'm going back to the carnival.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.040
What for?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.480
To see if I won the raffle.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.720
Well, you may
be brilliant

21:55.720 --> 21:58.520
but you're the worst
magician I've ever seen.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.960
You wouldn't know it

21:59.960 --> 22:02.040
from all
the donations I got.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.680
So, what about
that movie you owe me?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.040
I can't do it, Alex.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.400
I really have
to go check on Bryce.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.160
He was really
sick before.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.080
Bryce, again?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.040
Alex, I was there
for you, wasn't I?

22:17.040 --> 22:20.040
When your head was a puddle,
I fixed it, didn't I?

22:20.040 --> 22:21.240
Yeah.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.200
Well, next time
my head's a puddle

22:23.200 --> 22:25.240
I won't ask for your help, okay?

22:25.240 --> 22:28.440
Next time your head
is a puddle?

22:28.440 --> 22:30.520
Never mind, Mom...

22:30.520 --> 22:32.080
Private joke.
