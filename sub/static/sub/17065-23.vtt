00:01.078 --> 00:03.085
<i>Katie! It's Sage.</i>

00:03.203 --> 00:05.764
<i>I wanted to see if you'd
volunteer at the Fall Festival.</i>

00:05.789 --> 00:08.385
<i>I've got a five-hour block
on the lunch-lady line.</i>

00:08.466 --> 00:10.099
<i>Sloppy Tofurkey Joes!</i>

00:10.159 --> 00:11.859
<i>How can you say "no" s?</i>

00:11.963 --> 00:14.463
<i>I rhymed. Call me!</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.719
Ooh! The Fall Festival.

00:16.781 --> 00:17.974
Delete.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.185
<i>It's not easy avoiding
mandatory volunteering</i>

00:20.271 --> 00:22.621
<i>for an entire school year, but I do it.</i>

00:22.657 --> 00:24.312
<i>I do it for moms everywhere.</i>

00:24.453 --> 00:26.253
<i>We slave away for free every day.</i>

00:26.339 --> 00:28.056
<i>Why should we perform unpaid labor?</i>

00:28.123 --> 00:29.473
Katie!

00:29.525 --> 00:31.742
Just seeing if you can volunteer
for the Winter Festival.

00:31.827 --> 00:33.243
Can't talk... just swallowed a bug.

00:33.295 --> 00:35.379
Got to run home and get it out
before it lays eggs.

00:35.464 --> 00:36.430
Just send a message.

00:36.515 --> 00:37.981
But you never return my messages.

00:38.067 --> 00:39.199
Sounds good!

00:46.300 --> 00:47.583
Katie? Are you there?

00:47.626 --> 00:49.059
The school year's almost over,

00:49.094 --> 00:51.778
and you have to complete
your mandatory volunteer hours.

00:51.864 --> 00:53.113
I know you're in there, Katie.

00:53.198 --> 00:54.898
The hood of your car is
hot to the touch,

00:54.983 --> 00:56.399
so I can tell you just got home.

00:56.451 --> 00:58.068
Katie, if you don't complete your hours,

00:58.120 --> 01:00.036
the kids will stop
looking up to us as role models,

01:00.072 --> 01:01.738
and then they'll turn to drugs!

01:01.790 --> 01:04.541
<i>Okay, I just have to stay quiet
for five more minutes.</i>

01:04.575 --> 01:06.793
<i>Then the sprinklers go on.</i>

01:13.085 --> 01:15.085
Hey. Listen to the intro
I just wrote for my book.

01:15.137 --> 01:17.170
"Scholars have, for years,
thought they'd squeezed

01:17.256 --> 01:19.172
all they could out of
Elizabethan philosophy"...

01:19.258 --> 01:20.757
Greg, does this ever
work out well for us,

01:20.843 --> 01:22.425
when you read me smart things you wrote?

01:22.511 --> 01:24.477
Sometimes, in order to avoid it,
you sleep with me.

01:24.563 --> 01:25.762
So yes.

01:25.814 --> 01:27.347
Didn't you just do laundry?

01:27.432 --> 01:29.766
What you don't understand is,
I'm always doing laundry.

01:29.852 --> 01:31.234
Except for when I'm doing dishes,

01:31.270 --> 01:33.320
which is ceramic laundry.

01:33.405 --> 01:34.855
But I'm actually
giving these clothes away

01:34.940 --> 01:35.939
to needy children.

01:36.024 --> 01:37.274
Aww.

01:38.577 --> 01:41.077
Oliver wore this
at his first birthday party.

01:41.113 --> 01:43.524
Back when he didn't mind that we
bought his clothes from Costco.

01:44.449 --> 01:46.366
Angela got suckered in to volunteering

01:46.451 --> 01:47.834
for the children's clothing drive.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.453
Sage cornered her because
Angela's not as sneaky as me.

01:50.539 --> 01:52.122
I'm just gonna save this.

01:52.207 --> 01:53.673
You never know.

01:53.759 --> 01:55.709
If you are talking
about having more kids,

01:55.794 --> 01:56.626
I do know.

01:56.712 --> 01:58.044
I am one year away

01:58.130 --> 02:00.263
from Taylor being able
to drive everybody to school.

02:00.299 --> 02:01.965
That's called retirement, man!

02:02.050 --> 02:04.384
I don't know. It'd be nice
for there to be six of us.

02:04.469 --> 02:06.970
You know, so we can fill
the toboggan at Splash Mountain.

02:07.022 --> 02:09.306
Not have some creepy stranger
ruining our picture.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.723
Great reason to have a baby, Greg.

02:10.809 --> 02:12.893
Don't you miss having
a little one around the house?

02:12.978 --> 02:16.313
That baby smell and those little socks?

02:16.365 --> 02:18.915
And that look they give you
when they take their first steps

02:18.951 --> 02:20.116
and fall into your arms?

02:20.202 --> 02:21.384
Yeah.

02:21.420 --> 02:23.753
And they always say "Mama"
before they say "Dada."

02:23.805 --> 02:24.938
That is true.

02:25.023 --> 02:26.439
Hey, can you two knock it off?

02:26.525 --> 02:28.408
And then they learn to talk,
and it all goes to hell.

02:28.493 --> 02:31.111
I'm upstairs,
going over my ballet routine,

02:31.196 --> 02:32.963
and all I hear
is you two blathering away.

02:33.048 --> 02:34.264
- Hey!
- No "Hey"!

02:34.299 --> 02:36.516
My recital is coming up,
and if I don't do well,

02:36.602 --> 02:37.901
I don't advance to the next level.

02:37.936 --> 02:39.736
And then my plan
to get a ballet scholarship

02:39.788 --> 02:41.671
into Harvard is over... over!

02:41.707 --> 02:43.340
Wow. You are one angry...

02:43.375 --> 02:45.141
whatever a male ballet dancer is called.

02:45.177 --> 02:46.176
"Ballerino."

02:46.261 --> 02:47.427
That can't be it.

02:47.512 --> 02:48.945
I have to work harder
than the other kids

02:48.981 --> 02:51.114
because they started
much earlier than I did...

02:51.166 --> 02:53.583
because their parents
wanted them to succeed in life.

02:53.635 --> 02:54.918
Okay.

02:55.003 --> 02:57.721
I know you're under a lot
of pressure with this recital,

02:57.773 --> 02:59.272
but if you ever talk to us
that way again,

02:59.358 --> 03:00.523
you're gonna go to Harvard,

03:00.575 --> 03:02.959
but as a cadaver
in their medical program.

03:06.932 --> 03:08.798
Mother/daughter selfie!

03:10.268 --> 03:11.785
Are you posting that on Instagram?

03:11.870 --> 03:13.370
Of course. Why else
would you take a picture?

03:13.405 --> 03:14.120
Mm.

03:15.507 --> 03:18.058
I forget how photogenic I am.

03:18.143 --> 03:19.342
It's unreal.

03:20.562 --> 03:21.778
You guys ready for school?

03:21.813 --> 03:23.747
- Yes.
- Did you make your bed, like I said?

03:23.782 --> 03:25.131
- No.
- I did.

03:25.217 --> 03:27.000
Did you put your homework
in your backpack, like I said?

03:27.085 --> 03:28.435
- No.
- I did.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.719
That's why you're my favorite.

03:29.805 --> 03:31.905
Now, you two,
go upstairs and do what I said.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.576
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yes!

03:36.662 --> 03:38.662
No, you didn't. Anna-Kat, watch 'em.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.504
Oh, look... the Chosen One has decided

03:47.539 --> 03:49.806
- to grace us with her presence.
- Huh?

03:49.841 --> 03:52.726
It's bad enough you're the favorite.
Don't pretend to be humble, too.

03:52.811 --> 03:54.227
Mom likes us all the same.

03:54.312 --> 03:57.280
If she could only save one of us
in a flood, it'd be you.

03:57.349 --> 03:59.249
She'd let us drown like sewer rats.

04:01.720 --> 04:02.719
Hey.

04:02.804 --> 04:05.555
I don't want you guys to be mad at me.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.791
I won't be Mama's favorite anymore.

04:07.826 --> 04:09.325
Too late.

04:09.411 --> 04:11.544
You'll always be her favorite,
and there's nothing you can do.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.847
That's not true. When I'm done,

04:13.932 --> 04:16.349
Mama will hate me
just as much as she hates you.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.536
Oh. Thanks.

04:20.622 --> 04:22.639
This mandatory volunteering
is the worst.

04:22.674 --> 04:25.191
Is it even legal,
forcing people to volunteer?

04:25.277 --> 04:27.277
I think they rely
mostly on people's shame,

04:27.312 --> 04:29.612
which is why they've had
such a hard time with you.

04:29.698 --> 04:31.331
Well, I just have three weeks left.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.166
I can't believe you let Sage catch you.

04:33.251 --> 04:34.751
She was lying in wait for me
at the bottom

04:34.803 --> 04:36.136
of the rock-climbing wall at the gym.

04:36.221 --> 04:38.188
- You're giving Mr. Horsey away?
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.439
What if we need him?

04:39.524 --> 04:40.990
For what, Greg...
so that your old treadmill

04:41.076 --> 04:42.742
has a buddy to talk to in the garage?

04:42.828 --> 04:44.294
I'm just saying... you never know.

04:44.379 --> 04:45.929
Ohhh!

04:45.964 --> 04:47.013
No "Ohhh."

04:47.099 --> 04:48.932
And stop saying that.

04:49.017 --> 04:51.317
The baby factory is shut down,

04:51.403 --> 04:52.819
despite the fact
that there's still tours

04:52.904 --> 04:54.370
on weekends and anniversaries.

04:55.574 --> 04:58.374
- What in the world is that?
- This?

04:58.427 --> 05:01.311
Oh. This is Celeste's old empathy belly.

05:01.346 --> 05:02.679
When I was pregnant with our kids,

05:02.731 --> 05:03.847
she wore this fake baby bump

05:03.899 --> 05:05.482
so she could feel pregnant
along with me.

05:05.534 --> 05:06.950
Does it make your feet swell

05:06.985 --> 05:08.318
and have you pee down your leg
a little bit all the time?

05:08.403 --> 05:10.620
No, but if you turn it around,
it makes your butt

05:10.655 --> 05:12.589
really popular with a specific audience.

05:12.624 --> 05:14.374
I'm gonna wear this to Second Breakfast.

05:14.459 --> 05:16.342
I can't wait to see
the look on Doris' face.

05:16.428 --> 05:18.561
Yeah, Doris' shocked face is the best.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.282
What the...

05:23.335 --> 05:25.702
Oh, my God. That is hilarious!

05:27.305 --> 05:30.106
I am committing to this...
and eating a large breakfast.

05:30.142 --> 05:32.642
Can you even imagine if this was real?

05:32.694 --> 05:33.860
You'd come in with your diaper bag

05:33.945 --> 05:35.562
and try to breast-feed your baby.

05:35.647 --> 05:36.813
I'd spend all breakfast

05:36.865 --> 05:38.948
trying not to sneak a peek
at those giant fun bags.

05:40.869 --> 05:43.470
Don't worry... I'm done.
I'm finished with having babies.

05:43.555 --> 05:45.722
because the problem with babies
is, they become kids,

05:45.807 --> 05:47.273
and kids always need something from you

05:47.359 --> 05:48.658
when you're watching TV.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.493
I can't believe Greg wants another one.

05:50.529 --> 05:51.661
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:51.696 --> 05:53.363
- Greg hasn't had a vasectomy?
- Nope.

05:53.448 --> 05:55.381
You mean, you haven't had him...

05:55.467 --> 05:58.168
Can't do that. His nads are
my Dead Katie Insurance.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.419
Is she making sense,

05:59.504 --> 06:01.421
or did my edible from last night
not wear off yet?

06:01.506 --> 06:03.189
Okay, If I suddenly die,

06:03.275 --> 06:05.108
Greg is gonna need to marry someone

06:05.143 --> 06:06.860
to help him raise our idiot kids.

06:06.945 --> 06:09.445
And no halfway-decent woman
is going to sign on for that

06:09.481 --> 06:11.614
unless she can have
her own baby with him.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.501
Mm. I'm looking for the flaw
in that logic.

06:14.586 --> 06:16.536
But I can't find it. Well done.

06:16.621 --> 06:17.954
Uh-oh. Incoming.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.839
Sage rounding up more volunteers.

06:19.925 --> 06:21.141
Oh, God.

06:21.226 --> 06:23.393
Katie!

06:23.428 --> 06:24.344
Gotcha!

06:25.597 --> 06:27.647
Did you hear Sage, Katie? She gotcha.

06:27.732 --> 06:29.933
Sage, have you been getting my messages?

06:29.985 --> 06:31.568
Let's not do that, Katie.

06:31.603 --> 06:33.319
I need someone to help the school nurse

06:33.405 --> 06:34.821
return the medications to the kids

06:34.906 --> 06:36.156
the last week of school...

06:36.241 --> 06:39.826
EpiPens, inhalers,
ADD meds, ADHD pills...

06:39.911 --> 06:41.077
Ooh, I'll do it.

06:41.112 --> 06:43.413
All pills are logged
and accounted for, Doris.

06:43.448 --> 06:44.447
Then, I'm busy.

06:44.499 --> 06:45.915
I'm putting your name down.

06:45.951 --> 06:47.584
You have to arrive at school
at 7:00 a.m....

06:47.619 --> 06:50.336
Hold that thought! I think I see
the Latin guy from "CHiPs."

06:50.422 --> 06:52.422
Oh, my God, Katie! You're pregnant!

06:52.457 --> 06:54.174
Oh! No.

06:54.259 --> 06:55.375
I'm not really...

06:55.460 --> 06:57.093
I mean, I thought you might be,

06:57.128 --> 06:58.628
but I didn't want to say anything.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.430
Oh, really? Well,
just so you know, Sage...

07:00.465 --> 07:03.216
You can't be working in the nurse's
office when you're pregnant.

07:03.301 --> 07:06.269
That's basically as dangerous
as vaccinating your children.

07:07.022 --> 07:09.772
I'll just mark your
volunteer hours as "complete."

07:11.359 --> 07:14.394
Me and my unborn child...

07:14.479 --> 07:15.695
thank you.

07:21.422 --> 07:23.258
Why are you still wearing
that ridiculous thing?

07:23.319 --> 07:25.786
Sage let me out of my volunteer hours,

07:25.821 --> 07:27.504
an old lady let me cut in line
at Trader Joe's.

07:27.589 --> 07:30.440
and no one complained
when I took double samples.

07:30.526 --> 07:33.076
Being fake pregnant is the best!

07:33.162 --> 07:34.933
Wait... you got out
of your volunteer hours

07:35.011 --> 07:36.797
- because Sage thinks you're pregnant?
- Amazing, right?

07:36.849 --> 07:37.964
Because, really,

07:38.017 --> 07:40.227
these volunteer hours
are a war on women.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.702
There seem to be a lot of wars on women

07:41.770 --> 07:43.170
when you don't want to do something.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.088
All I have to do
is ride out this pregnancy

07:45.174 --> 07:46.556
till the end of the school year,

07:46.642 --> 07:47.991
and then people will forget
all about it.

07:48.026 --> 07:49.443
Forget all about your missing baby?

07:49.511 --> 07:50.277
Yeah.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.229
You are out of your mind.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.681
Don't worry. I'm gonna do the
"I Love Lucy" cheese-baby trick.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.450
I'm not familiar with that,
but it doesn't s...

07:56.535 --> 07:58.752
Lucy carried a fake baby made of cheese

07:58.837 --> 08:00.036
to get a seat on an airplane,

08:00.089 --> 08:01.888
but then ate the whole
cheese baby on the flight.

08:01.974 --> 08:03.140
When the woman asked,
"Where's the baby?"

08:03.225 --> 08:04.191
she was like, "What baby?"

08:04.276 --> 08:05.659
I'll just do that.

08:05.744 --> 08:07.210
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to say

08:07.246 --> 08:08.462
you're a surrogate or something?

08:08.547 --> 08:09.980
Katie. No. Katie...

08:10.015 --> 08:12.065
Surrogate! That's perfect.

08:12.151 --> 08:13.600
Love being married to a genius.

08:13.685 --> 08:14.868
Now, can you go get the kids?

08:14.953 --> 08:18.121
I can't because sometimes,
Sage volunteers at pickup,

08:18.173 --> 08:20.474
and I'm dying to take this thing off.

08:20.559 --> 08:21.825
I can't. I'm working on my book.

08:22.945 --> 08:24.578
Okay. Fine.

08:25.781 --> 08:28.348
You say you want another kid,
but here you are,

08:28.434 --> 08:30.967
sending your wife out on errands,

08:31.053 --> 08:32.486
eight months pretend pregnant.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:44.700 --> 08:46.616
Mom, we've got to move.
I can't be late for ballet.

08:46.702 --> 08:47.834
Today is our dress rehearsal.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.219
I need to work on my grand jetés!

08:49.304 --> 08:51.404
Bring it down, "Black Swan."
I'll get you there.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.323
Why can't you be nice,
like your big sister?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.491
I am nice.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.625
Oh, please! You think she's nice

08:55.694 --> 08:57.310
because she made
a fake Instagram account.

08:57.396 --> 08:59.062
- Shut up!
- Fake what?

08:59.148 --> 09:00.697
Don't listen to him, Mom.
He's just a jerk.

09:00.783 --> 09:01.782
I am a jerk.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.300
And I bask in it.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.552
I'm keeping your phone until
there's a full investigation.

09:05.637 --> 09:06.736
You can't take my phone away!

09:06.772 --> 09:07.771
It's not the end of the world.

09:07.856 --> 09:09.239
Yes, it is!

09:09.274 --> 09:10.590
How would you feel if you were my age

09:10.676 --> 09:12.209
and I took away your poodle skirt?

09:12.294 --> 09:13.844
How old do you think I am?

09:15.230 --> 09:16.730
Anna-Kat! Come on! We're late!

09:16.815 --> 09:17.948
I don't answer to you!

09:19.751 --> 09:20.917
What's gotten into her?

09:20.969 --> 09:22.719
Oliver, go get Anna-Kat.

09:22.754 --> 09:23.970
I can't get out of the car.

09:24.056 --> 09:25.272
I can't risk twisting my ankle

09:25.357 --> 09:26.740
this close to my big performance.

09:26.825 --> 09:27.874
Are you serious?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
Fine. Taylor, go get your sister.

09:29.995 --> 09:32.012
Oh, I would, Mom, but I might get lost,

09:32.097 --> 09:33.597
and I don't have a phone
to call for help.

09:33.682 --> 09:35.065
15 is such a bad age.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.750
Back in the day,
we would've married you off

09:36.835 --> 09:38.251
and gotten a couple of goats
in the bargain.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.044
What is going on with you, angel?

09:48.096 --> 09:49.479
I'm not an angel!

09:49.515 --> 09:51.815
I don't have time for this.
Anna-Kat, get in the car.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.016
Right now.

09:55.087 --> 09:56.786
Katie?!

09:56.839 --> 09:58.471
You're pregnant?

09:58.557 --> 10:00.390
Uhhh...

10:00.425 --> 10:01.474
looks like it.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.692
Well, it must be a girl,

10:02.778 --> 10:05.161
'cause you're carrying it
all over your body.

10:05.247 --> 10:06.680
A baby?!

10:06.765 --> 10:07.964
Why didn't you tell us?

10:08.016 --> 10:10.066
Well, because...

10:10.102 --> 10:12.869
I wanted to keep it a secret
from everyone.

10:12.955 --> 10:14.804
Since I'm a surrogate.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.089
You're a surrogate?!

10:16.174 --> 10:17.474
Yes, I am.

10:17.526 --> 10:19.993
For a very brave woman
who lost her ovaries...

10:20.078 --> 10:21.077
in the war.

10:21.129 --> 10:22.412
It was like "Pow!"

10:22.464 --> 10:25.048
And I didn't want to brag
or let anyone know

10:25.133 --> 10:27.350
how good a person I really am.

10:27.402 --> 10:28.318
Oh.

10:28.353 --> 10:30.403
I am so happy for you!

10:31.423 --> 10:33.673
Oh, and that brave soldier.

10:33.742 --> 10:35.475
I think I'm gonna cry!

10:35.561 --> 10:36.977
Ohh!

10:37.062 --> 10:39.946
<i>I actually feel a little bad
about tricking Suzanne.</i>

10:40.032 --> 10:42.799
<i>I don't know how, but she's grown on me.</i>

10:42.834 --> 10:44.801
<i>But it's balanced out
by the enjoyment I get</i>

10:44.836 --> 10:47.270
<i>from making Tara Summers think
I'm a good person.</i>

10:47.306 --> 10:48.555
<i>Ha ha!</i>

11:03.322 --> 11:04.621
Stupid thing!

11:04.706 --> 11:06.289
Doesn't fit!

11:16.702 --> 11:18.251
This is her real account, Greg.

11:18.337 --> 11:19.803
She has a fake one for us

11:19.838 --> 11:21.221
and a real one for who knows who.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.772
Where did she even get those shirts?

11:22.858 --> 11:24.324
We never bought her
anything that skimpy.

11:24.409 --> 11:26.359
She used scissors to cut
the perfectly nice shirts

11:26.445 --> 11:28.461
that we got her from Old Navy.

11:28.547 --> 11:30.080
Isn't that Anna-Kat's shirt?

11:30.132 --> 11:31.298
Oh, she's dead.

11:31.383 --> 11:34.935
Hey, little troublemaker!
Come in here right now!

11:35.020 --> 11:36.486
Don't do that thing
where you're too nice.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.371
I won't. Watch.

11:38.457 --> 11:41.174
We are so disappointed in you.
You lied to us.

11:41.259 --> 11:42.125
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

11:42.194 --> 11:43.343
I never lied.

11:43.428 --> 11:45.195
I just didn't tell you
about the other account.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.329
And it's not a big deal.

11:46.365 --> 11:47.864
All the other kids at school do it.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.499
I just wanted a little privacy.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.685
Privacy?! You have 900 followers!

11:51.770 --> 11:52.936
Only 900?!

11:52.971 --> 11:54.170
I'm already being unfollowed!

11:54.239 --> 11:55.605
Okay, we're gonna go to your room,

11:55.657 --> 11:56.940
and we're gonna throw away anything

11:57.025 --> 11:58.742
that an Amish teen
would not be allowed to wear.

11:58.794 --> 12:00.243
- To church.
- Come on!

12:00.295 --> 12:01.578
Go on, now.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.148
Anna-Kat, what are you doing?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.282
Drawing on the wall.

12:07.703 --> 12:09.119
That won't come out.

12:09.171 --> 12:11.421
I know. It's Sharpie.

12:11.473 --> 12:13.006
I guess I'm not your favorite anymore.

12:13.091 --> 12:14.474
I'm not saying that,

12:14.559 --> 12:17.477
but I don't want you to do
anything like that ever again.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.445
Ever!

12:20.782 --> 12:22.549
Told ya... still her favorite.

12:24.136 --> 12:26.569
Don't be mad at me
because you're not cute anymore.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.175
She what?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.377
Suzanne is insisting
on throwing you a baby shower.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.846
Did you tell her
that was totally unnecessary?

12:36.932 --> 12:38.898
Mm-hmm. She wouldn't take "No"
for an answer.

12:39.951 --> 12:42.185
Snack's ready!

12:42.254 --> 12:44.704
Hey, why didn't you guys
plan a shower for me?

12:44.790 --> 12:46.389
- You're not pregnant!
- Because it's a fake baby!

12:47.642 --> 12:49.309
Are you two here to tell her she's crazy

12:49.394 --> 12:50.427
for this fake-baby stuff?

12:50.512 --> 12:51.695
It's not crazy.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.063
You kids look at the small picture.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.198
Us adults look at the big picture.

12:55.283 --> 12:58.334
And the big picture is
you faking being pregnant

12:58.370 --> 12:59.969
to get out of volunteer hours?

13:00.005 --> 13:01.671
I'm the adult, you're the child.

13:01.757 --> 13:04.057
You don't get to judge
my questionable judgment.

13:04.142 --> 13:05.392
Now, eat your sandwiches.

13:05.477 --> 13:07.694
I'm on a hunger strike
until I get my phone back.

13:07.779 --> 13:10.363
What is this...
peanut butter and jelly?!

13:10.449 --> 13:11.831
It's going straight to my hips.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.750
Do you want me to end up at Cornell?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.168
Is that what you want?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.187
- Ow!
- Now go to your room!

13:17.222 --> 13:19.222
- You're not my mother...
- Ow!

13:19.307 --> 13:20.473
All right. I'm going.

13:20.559 --> 13:21.658
You bet you're going.

13:21.693 --> 13:23.610
She should not be around children.

13:23.695 --> 13:26.046
I pinch with these two fingers.
Leaves no marks.

13:26.131 --> 13:29.049
Your kids are either going to be
C.E.O.s or serial killers.

13:29.134 --> 13:31.051
I am willing to take that gamble.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.373
Ooh! Unh-unh!

13:37.409 --> 13:39.325
Real pregnant women
only drink in private, Katie.

13:39.411 --> 13:41.044
This is the best thing ever.

13:41.079 --> 13:43.797
They're throwing a shower
for a hunk of memory foam.

13:43.882 --> 13:46.883
Katie, I have to say...

13:46.935 --> 13:48.301
I have a whole new respect for you.

13:48.386 --> 13:49.219
Go on.

13:49.304 --> 13:51.104
What you're doing is so selfless.

13:51.189 --> 13:52.522
It's a side of you that,

13:52.574 --> 13:54.441
to be honest, I didn't think existed.

13:54.526 --> 13:57.026
Well, that's what you get
for judging people.

13:57.079 --> 13:59.546
Me... I don't judge.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.916
I love with an open and honest heart.

14:03.001 --> 14:04.084
Oh.

14:04.169 --> 14:05.852
Just felt a kick.

14:07.355 --> 14:08.638
May I touch your belly?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.473
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:10.525 --> 14:13.276
It's just that I'm a surrogate
and it's not my baby.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.945
I would let you,
but legally, I'm not allowed.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.814
You remember
the famous Supreme Court case

14:17.899 --> 14:19.365
Dinty vs. Moore?

14:19.451 --> 14:22.235
- Oh, yes, I read about that.
- Mm-hmm.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.572
Katie, I'm so happy
to be doing this for you.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.374
I felt like when we first met,
it took us a while to click,

14:28.460 --> 14:30.376
but now we're clicking!

14:30.462 --> 14:32.545
Actually, Suzanne,
I feel the exact same way.

14:32.631 --> 14:34.714
Thank you so much for this party

14:34.800 --> 14:37.383
and for letting me bring
little Anna-Kat.

14:37.469 --> 14:38.835
Oh, of course.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.804
She is such a cutie.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.505
She is, isn't she?

14:42.591 --> 14:43.556
She's my...

14:43.642 --> 14:45.925
Stop it! I am not your favorite!

14:46.011 --> 14:48.094
And this isn't a baby!

14:54.352 --> 14:56.402
Well...

14:56.488 --> 14:58.104
I guess I'm just gonna...

15:04.364 --> 15:06.457
Uh... yeah.

15:06.879 --> 15:10.356
You see, this is... really funny.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.575
I don't see anything remotely funny

15:12.660 --> 15:13.943
about pretending to be pregnant.

15:14.028 --> 15:15.111
Of course you wouldn't, Tara.

15:15.196 --> 15:17.584
I mean, everyone with a sense of humor
would see that this is funny.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.998
Right?

15:19.050 --> 15:20.967
Katie, why would you do
something like this?

15:21.052 --> 15:23.185
I didn't do it to hurt anybody.

15:23.271 --> 15:26.072
I just did it to get out of
mandatory volunteer hours.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.591
We all hate volunteering.

15:29.978 --> 15:30.960
I don't.

15:31.029 --> 15:32.645
Well, Sage, you're an unusual woman.

15:32.730 --> 15:34.030
Seriously, Katie.

15:34.115 --> 15:36.165
You didn't have to let me
throw you a baby shower.

15:36.251 --> 15:38.167
Yeah, but when do we all have
the chance to get together?

15:38.253 --> 15:39.885
When we volunteer at school.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.220
Right.

15:41.272 --> 15:42.521
I think it's best if you go.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.823
Suzanne!

15:47.595 --> 15:49.011
Okay.

15:49.097 --> 15:50.296
I understand.

15:51.849 --> 15:54.100
Angela and Doris, see if you can
bring the presents to the car.

15:55.787 --> 15:57.653
Why did you do that, Anna-Kat?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.221
I was finally making some progress

15:59.307 --> 16:01.507
with the ladies in this town,
and now I'm back to square one.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.309
I don't want
to be your favorite anymore.

16:03.361 --> 16:04.944
What? Why not?

16:04.996 --> 16:08.047
'Cause it makes Taylor and Oliver mad,
and then they're not nice to me.

16:08.127 --> 16:09.460
So I did things to make you upset,

16:09.512 --> 16:11.095
and nothing worked.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.981
So I lifted your shirt, hoping
you wouldn't like me anymore.

16:15.244 --> 16:18.178
Sweetpea... I will always like you.

16:18.264 --> 16:20.180
I will always love you.

16:20.266 --> 16:22.199
But if I put you in a bad spot

16:22.234 --> 16:24.401
with your brother and sister...

16:24.453 --> 16:26.236
I'm sorry.

16:26.288 --> 16:27.671
And I won't do it anymore.

16:28.841 --> 16:30.057
You promise?

16:30.142 --> 16:31.642
I promise.

16:31.727 --> 16:33.644
No more favorites in this family.

16:33.729 --> 16:35.412
I'm treating you all equally.

16:35.448 --> 16:36.480
Thanks, Mama!

16:36.549 --> 16:37.798
Of course!

16:37.883 --> 16:39.917
Anything for my fav...

16:40.002 --> 16:41.101
Anything for you.

16:46.826 --> 16:49.009
Mom! I need my phone back!

16:49.094 --> 16:50.294
No!

16:50.346 --> 16:51.762
Where are my tights?
I can't find my tights!

16:51.814 --> 16:53.564
- They're in the bathroom.
- I just looked in there!

16:53.616 --> 16:54.698
They're on the shower rod.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.700
Mom, if I don't continue
my Snapchat streaks,

16:56.735 --> 16:58.702
I'm no different than the girl
with the striped tube socks

16:58.754 --> 17:00.003
who reads books at lunch!

17:00.089 --> 17:02.356
- Do you want that for a daughter?!
- Is she available?!

17:02.441 --> 17:03.857
You're so unfair!

17:03.943 --> 17:06.492
I'd try to help you, but I'm not
her favorite anymore.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.628
Shut up, or I will lock you
in the basement.

17:08.714 --> 17:10.681
- Not the basement!
- Taylor, don't say that!

17:10.715 --> 17:11.765
You know she's afraid of the basement!

17:11.851 --> 17:13.150
Duh! That's why I'm saying it!

17:13.185 --> 17:15.486
How many times do I need
to tell you... don't "Duh" me!

17:15.521 --> 17:16.737
- Talk to your children!
- About what?

17:16.821 --> 17:18.321
Do I have to figure out
everything around here?!

17:18.406 --> 17:19.705
I don't know what's happening!

17:19.791 --> 17:21.208
My tights are damp! My tights are damp!

17:21.292 --> 17:23.093
Just put them on wet. They'll be
dry by the time we get there.

17:23.179 --> 17:24.978
- You don't know that!
- I know everything!

17:25.064 --> 17:27.064
Now, everybody! Get in the car!

17:29.618 --> 17:31.381
What's this doing here?

17:32.388 --> 17:33.637
I got it back from Angela,
because, you know...

17:33.672 --> 17:35.389
Don't say "You never know."

17:35.474 --> 17:38.141
I know. The kids know.
Even Mr. Horsey knows, Greg.

17:38.177 --> 17:40.194
How are you not smarter than Mr. Horsey?

17:51.340 --> 17:53.056
Why are we even here?

17:53.108 --> 17:54.725
We're supporting your brother.

17:54.810 --> 17:55.893
I want to go home.

17:55.945 --> 17:57.227
We all want to go home.

17:57.313 --> 17:59.329
Everybody in this place
wishes they were at home.

17:59.415 --> 18:00.831
They're just too polite to show it.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.100
Maybe they just like children.

18:03.135 --> 18:04.968
I don't understand why you don't
even want to talk about it.

18:05.054 --> 18:06.720
If this last couple of days
has taught me anything,

18:06.805 --> 18:08.021
it's that I'm done.

18:08.107 --> 18:10.858
Which means... we are done.

18:38.787 --> 18:40.904
What is this?

18:40.990 --> 18:44.207
Well, it's beginning ballet.
Who else is gonna take it?

19:10.886 --> 19:13.503
This is the cutest thing
that I have ever seen.

19:17.643 --> 19:21.094
<i>Some days, as a mom,
everything goes wrong,</i>

19:21.180 --> 19:23.263
<i>and you just can't take another second.</i>

19:23.349 --> 19:26.316
<i>But all it takes is one good moment</i>

19:26.352 --> 19:29.403
<i>to erase the 10 million crappy ones.</i>

19:36.028 --> 19:37.661
Maybe.

19:45.209 --> 19:47.253
- Three cameras and mark!
- Uh-huh!

19:49.934 --> 19:51.483
And I thought of a title...
"John Stuart Mill

19:51.569 --> 19:52.985
and the Consequences
of a Thoroughgoing"...

19:53.070 --> 19:53.969
Mm.

19:54.004 --> 19:55.270
Amazing!

19:55.306 --> 19:57.039
And I thought of a title...
"John Stuart Mill

19:57.074 --> 19:58.791
and the Consequences of a Long-Term"...

19:58.876 --> 20:00.175
- Okay.
- Amazing!

20:01.812 --> 20:03.912
Spoken like a man...

20:03.981 --> 20:05.881
who came across the ocean...

20:09.687 --> 20:11.510
- Help!
- Cut!

20:15.292 --> 20:17.759
You want me to go in sooner, honey?

20:17.795 --> 20:18.961
We are trying

20:19.046 --> 20:20.762
to celebrate Valentine's Day
over here...

20:20.798 --> 20:22.097
I am so mean.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.515
Am I too mean?

20:23.601 --> 20:26.218
Still rolling.

20:26.303 --> 20:29.271
Greg, have you ever thought that
maybe you're just being mean?

20:32.309 --> 20:33.775
I don't know how to get down.

20:33.811 --> 20:34.860
What was he talking about?

20:34.945 --> 20:37.196
Why does Don think that we have... um...

20:37.281 --> 20:39.281
What was he talking about?
Why does Don...

20:39.316 --> 20:41.316
What was he talking about?
What exactly does...

20:41.368 --> 20:42.568
Why does... Why exactly...

20:43.305 --> 20:49.722
