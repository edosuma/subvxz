WEBVTT

00:09.844 --> 00:11.321
Eve: Our team was sent out

00:11.345 --> 00:14.057
to look into a string of
international assassinations.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.827
There didn't seem to be
a whole lot connecting them

00:16.851 --> 00:18.929
except for this
female assassin...

00:20.721 --> 00:22.466
Villanelle.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.402
A woman in London is
investigating your work.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.636
Villanelle:
What's her name?

00:26.660 --> 00:27.771
Eve Polastri.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.272
Promise you won't be naughty.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.277
I want to have dinner with you!

00:34.301 --> 00:35.846
Eve: Who do you work for?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.581
Why are you killing
these people?

00:37.605 --> 00:40.517
The organization calls
themselves the Twelve.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.918
I want you out of this.

00:41.942 --> 00:44.243
If you value our life, you will.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.991
Why are you and Villanelle
so interested in each other?

00:48.015 --> 00:49.559
Eve: I think about you
all the time.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.383
What you feel
when you kill someone.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.032
I really liked you.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.668
Carolyn:
She's on the move.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.637
She stabbed you?
Didn't she tell you?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.039
Konstantin:
I can't do this anymore.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.574
I want the recipe
to your shepherd's pie.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.443
You gonna leave us alone now?
Of course not.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.980
I need your help
with something important.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.448
You really mustn't kill anyone.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.272
Villanelle.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.253
You wanted him dead.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.254
You'll get over it.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.422
I'm gonna find Kenny

01:18.446 --> 01:20.123
and tell him everything
you've done.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.691
He already knows.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.160
You have to leave Eve behind.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.261
It's finished.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.096
Ow! Do it.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.299
You have a gun?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.801
You wanted me to do it.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.536
You're mine.
No.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.937
I thought you were special.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.405
I'm sorry to disappoint.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.815
Especially if that love,

04:44.051 --> 04:45.517
introduces themselves,

04:45.819 --> 04:48.420
by marching up to you
in the middle of the airport,

04:48.722 --> 04:51.290
saying, "I'm going
wherever you are going."

04:55.462 --> 04:57.996
This day, this speech,

04:58.799 --> 04:59.965
and this toast...

05:02.469 --> 05:03.835
Is for us.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.910
We love you!

05:30.164 --> 05:31.408
If I'd have known
getting married

05:31.432 --> 05:32.432
would be this much fun,

05:32.566 --> 05:33.926
I'd have done it
loads more by now.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.635
When I first met Maria...

05:38.906 --> 05:42.441
I thought, "Great shoes."

05:42.643 --> 05:43.643
But then I learned,

05:43.744 --> 05:45.344
there's so much
more to her than that.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.079
She also has a great house,

05:47.314 --> 05:49.981
and a pool and tailor.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.317
Hairdresser.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.153
It really is the all-around
excellent package.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.902
When we met...

06:11.205 --> 06:13.038
I'd just had
a really bad breakup.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.477
It was really bad.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.349
But when I think
about my ex today...

06:28.722 --> 06:29.921
I realise...

06:32.826 --> 06:35.293
I am so much happier
now she's dead.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.371
This is my special day.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.012
Sincere...

08:01.515 --> 08:02.747
Congratulations!

08:02.950 --> 08:04.082
Stop it!

09:14.621 --> 09:16.988
Apparently,
I've lost their trust.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.291
Was that something
you ever wanted to find?

09:19.459 --> 09:20.559
Not quite.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.761
The problem being,

09:21.995 --> 09:23.835
they've brought someone in
to oversee the desk.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.298
Someone dreadful, I might add.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.099
You're joking.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.367
Diane doesn't joke.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.237
She's too constricted.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.940
And she specifically chose,

09:35.142 --> 09:36.741
a Whitehall Warrior

09:37.010 --> 09:38.310
in a rather successful attempt

09:38.512 --> 09:39.544
to irritate me.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.147
So we're basically
being overseen

09:42.382 --> 09:45.617
by a massive wanker.
Precisely.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.679
What would you like?
Orecchiette please, Sam.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.457
I mean, Diane's
been waiting
for years

09:52.759 --> 09:54.526
to strike back at me,
and now's her chance.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.796
She is a prime example
of upper level

09:58.065 --> 10:00.131
preventing the real work
from being done.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.468
Bureaucracy in all its glory.

10:04.504 --> 10:05.504
Parmigiano?

10:06.139 --> 10:07.205
Carolyn?

10:08.442 --> 10:10.342
Here we go.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.946
I hear you've been very naughty.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.048
Have I? How thrilling.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.885
This is Mo Jafari.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.454
A very promising young agent,

10:22.723 --> 10:24.889
who I unearthed in Comms
of all places.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.392
Mo, Paul Bradwell.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.594
Paul was once
the rising star of MI6

10:29.863 --> 10:31.730
until he defected
to the other side.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.279
I don't think the Foreign Office

10:33.400 --> 10:35.233
can be considered
the other side, Carolyn.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.569
Don't you?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.738
I'm back now, with bells on.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.840
So we can hear you coming?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.344
Oh, we're always
like this, aren't we?

10:46.546 --> 10:47.912
Yes. Yes, we are.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.583
Now listen, I understand
you're feeling a bit chippy,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.551
but I honestly had no idea

10:53.887 --> 10:55.820
they were going
to ask me to run
the desk.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.189
Oversee, Paul, not "run".

10:59.226 --> 11:00.226
Oversee.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.029
Whatever you say.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.185
You know, I very
nearly called you
over Christmas.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.811
I was going through
a terrible divorce

11:08.835 --> 11:10.168
and I thought, if anybody knows

11:10.437 --> 11:12.337
how to get through this,
it's Carolyn.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.039
She's done it enough times.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.275
Divorces are easy.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.711
It's marriages that are
impossibly hard.

11:19.913 --> 11:20.913
Are you joining us?

11:20.981 --> 11:22.981
No, no, no.
I have to dash.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.382
Lunch with the chief.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.186
We're going to make
a fabulous team.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.324
And Carolyn,

11:33.627 --> 11:36.261
I'm so sorry about
the whole office debacle.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.810
They told me I had to take yours

11:37.998 --> 11:40.198
as it was closer
to the department.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.567
Paul, I don't even know
where my office is.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.571
Good luck with Diane.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.973
I hear she's in a feisty mood.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.211
Three clean-up operations,
unauthorised.

11:53.547 --> 11:57.415
The employment of former
MI5 agents, unauthorised.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.118
Safe-housing an FSB agent...

12:01.521 --> 12:02.987
Unauthorised.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.263
Former agent, Hugo Turner,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.957
who is currently, suing MI6

12:06.193 --> 12:07.193
for injuries incurred

12:07.260 --> 12:09.294
during your operation in Rome,

12:09.529 --> 12:11.162
also unauthorised.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.366
Â£416.27, unpaid lunches

12:15.569 --> 12:17.268
at the canteen.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.271
And that's to say nothing
of Polastri's fate.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.607
Well, Carolyn, what on earth

12:22.876 --> 12:24.843
do you have to say for yourself?

14:31.705 --> 14:32.971
Hey, watch it!

14:34.674 --> 14:35.740
Screw you.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.454
We have been watching you
since Rome.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.889
You know that, don't you?

14:54.828 --> 14:56.027
You're not easy to replace.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.862
You should see
some of the cretins

14:58.098 --> 14:59.264
they send for me to train.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.734
If you did ever want back in,

15:04.004 --> 15:06.204
I can get you more
of everything.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.909
Money, travel, apartment.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.412
All better than you've ever had.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.448
You're so talented.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.351
You're the best
I ever trained. You're...

15:19.653 --> 15:21.786
"Destined for greatness."
Destined for greatness.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.087
It's true.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.723
You have brilliant career
ahead of you, Oksana...

15:25.926 --> 15:27.725
Do you think I'm stupid?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.530
Do you think I'm stupid?

15:43.176 --> 15:44.176
I'm still champion.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.643
Best out of three.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.648
Kopveska?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.183
I get them imported to...
Yeah!

15:52.419 --> 15:54.185
Hey, that is cheating.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.021
So...

15:58.591 --> 16:00.325
If I do ever want to come back,

16:01.861 --> 16:05.263
and you give me
all this amazing stuff...

16:10.103 --> 16:12.270
What's in it
for you? Hmm?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.340
Knowing my most talented student

16:15.575 --> 16:16.874
is doing work of her destiny.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.376
Uh-uh.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.112
I repeat...

16:21.348 --> 16:22.747
What is in it for you?

16:29.589 --> 16:32.490
If I get you back
and working well...

16:34.995 --> 16:37.628
They will send me home,
to Russia.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.932
Whatever you want, I will do it.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.834
I will get you anything.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.335
Just tell me.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.575
Trust me.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.543
Power is there
for the taking, Oksana.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.113
You just have to be
smart about how.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.816
Slowly, slowly, catch a monkey.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.819
A Keeper.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.156
I want to be a Keeper.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.157
A Keeper is big.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.493
Higher than Konstantin,
it's higher than me.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.497
You said what I wanted,
that's what I want.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.200
Ah-ha. Okay, okay.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.103
We... We can
work with this.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.739
Right?
Yeah, we can work with this.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.508
She wants to be Keeper.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.510
"Oksana, the Keeper."

17:26.813 --> 17:29.414
Oksana wants to be Keeper.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.582
Oksana, the Keeper.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.071
I will go to them tomorrow
and I will say she wants...

17:36.222 --> 17:37.488
"Villanelle."

17:39.859 --> 17:41.059
You call me Villanelle.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.632
Okay. Okay.
Villanelle.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.469
Are you all right?
Ow!

18:25.071 --> 18:26.071
No, I'm not.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.366
Some bastard's been stealing
my Tangfastics again.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.142
Better call in the troops.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.678
Well, you joke,
but theft is theft,
my friend.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.913
Tangfastics today,
data tomorrow.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.417
Hi.
Hey.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.390
Pop quiz tonight?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.893
Erm, I can't this evening.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.035
But we need you for all
the football questions.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.463
I'm meeting someone.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.299
A friend.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.635
And I'm not the only one
who knows about football.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.904
You have friends?
Ha.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.409
You realise to fit in here,

19:05.678 --> 19:06.838
you have to be socially inept

19:06.880 --> 19:08.279
like the rest of us.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.348
Oh, I'm that too.
Don't worry.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.352
So, who's the friend?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.655
It's erm...
It's nothing, really.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.395
You know, a normal person

19:23.463 --> 19:24.543
would flake on their friend

19:24.697 --> 19:25.937
when something better turns up.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.879
Well, remind me not to
rely on you for anything.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.671
I liked your piece

19:32.906 --> 19:34.605
on evasive jellyfish
migration, by the way.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.508
Thanks. I liked yours.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.764
Oh, wait, you haven't
written anything, have you?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.112
I'm working on it.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.780
I don't care!

19:42.982 --> 19:44.315
No, you promised us...

19:44.684 --> 19:47.485
You said he doesn't push it
if it's not ready, right?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.587
I said that about me.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.223
Look, I could help you,

19:52.458 --> 19:54.859
if you tell me what it's about.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.794
I don't really know yet.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.096
Okay, then.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.834
Unbelievable!

20:06.806 --> 20:08.039
I will find you.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.221
I like the kitchen.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.026
I like the kitchen.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.764
Okay.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.403
I'll take this.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.642
This is sweet.
Are you visiting?
Yes.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.946
No. This is
for my daughter.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.515
She likes London, does she?

23:04.751 --> 23:06.384
She hates everything about it.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.254
That's why I'm sending it.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.324
One and two,

23:13.559 --> 23:15.559
and stretch your legs!

23:16.162 --> 23:17.695
And finish!

23:26.272 --> 23:28.339
Are you crying?
Don't be a wimp.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.852
When you really, really

23:29.876 --> 23:30.908
want to piss her off,

23:31.177 --> 23:33.844
you say, "Russia
is a corrupt state,

23:34.147 --> 23:36.347
"clinging to the shadows
of its Soviet glory."

23:36.682 --> 23:38.716
You see this woman?
She was useless just like you,

23:38.985 --> 23:41.385
but I showed her
how to be strong.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.753
And fight dirty.
Yes.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.724
Fight dirty,
but listen to Dasha.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.593
Now piss off.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.529
And tomorrow,
I want you on fire.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.770
I scared the shit out of them.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.305
Really?

24:03.643 --> 24:04.842
They're open to it.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.311
That doesn't sound like a yes.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.280
They'll promote you
with full benefits,

24:09.549 --> 24:10.659
but first you have to show them

24:10.683 --> 24:11.683
you're up to the job.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.785
No. That's not
what I asked for.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.120
It's a process.

24:16.389 --> 24:18.022
Nothing good comes fast.
You know that.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.291
Slowly, slowly...
Enough with the monkey!

24:20.526 --> 24:22.493
A good solid job, nice,

24:23.196 --> 24:25.095
political agitator...

24:26.566 --> 24:27.765
And local, too.

24:28.935 --> 24:33.237
Plus, big, fat,
welcome-home bonus.

24:33.439 --> 24:34.572
Have fun with it.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.775
Your work was always
so inventive and fresh.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.877
Almost as good as mine.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.079
Better than yours.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.247
Hmm?
Hmm.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.014
You know they still
study my kills,

24:44.717 --> 24:45.950
for their brilliance?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.420
My work remains
totally untouchable...

24:49.655 --> 24:51.021
Because it's out of date.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.656
Do you want this job or not?

25:21.220 --> 25:22.419
Shit.

26:10.836 --> 26:11.836
<i>First message.</i>

26:22.181 --> 26:23.781
<i>Second message.</i>

26:25.618 --> 26:27.851
<i>Dad, you need to come home now.</i>

26:28.187 --> 26:29.698
<i>Mum's driving me crazy...</i>

26:29.722 --> 26:31.522
<i>And her sack of shit
boyfriend is...</i>

26:36.529 --> 26:37.761
Delivery?

26:41.734 --> 26:42.734
<i>A total dick.</i>

26:43.002 --> 26:45.436
<i>And I need you to come back
and get me.</i>

26:45.771 --> 26:48.539
<i>Why are you still in that
damp dump of a country anyway?</i>

26:48.841 --> 26:50.401
<i>You said you'd be back
in a few weeks,</i>

26:50.443 --> 26:51.809
<i>but it's been...</i>

27:16.602 --> 27:18.102
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:18.371 --> 27:20.804
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
You texted me.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.973
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.319
It didn't make a lot of sense.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.477
Something about
"loo paper, beer"?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.345
Oh. Oh, God.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.934
I was a bit worried
if I'm honest,

27:30.016 --> 27:31.281
so I tracked your phone.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.428
You know, you really shouldn't
leave your front door open,

27:33.452 --> 27:34.563
considering the amount of people

27:34.587 --> 27:35.707
that have tried to kill you.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.729
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.943
I'm really, really sorry
about what went down.
No, no, no.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.727
Let me say it.
It's really best
if you didn't.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.101
I prefer things...
Buried.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.303
Exactly.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.207
Well, that's very... British.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.411
Cheers.
Cheers.

28:09.622 --> 28:10.688
I went to see you,

28:10.923 --> 28:11.963
after they transported you

28:12.224 --> 28:13.891
from the hospital
in Rome.
Really?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.060
But they weren't
allowing visitors

28:16.295 --> 28:17.594
and I felt a bit, erm...

28:20.299 --> 28:22.299
Lucky those tourists
found you when they did.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.803
You missing MI6?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.171
Absolutely not.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.674
How is it?
I have no idea. I quit.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.844
I've started working
at Bitter Pill.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.079
You're a journalist?

28:35.414 --> 28:37.334
"Open-source investigator"
is the official title.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.882
No way.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.278
It's been decent, to be fair.

28:40.786 --> 28:41.786
The site's good

28:41.887 --> 28:43.687
and they let me
investigate what I want.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.422
The guy who runs it
is pretty cool.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.405
Working for someone
with integrity, it's...

28:47.560 --> 28:49.226
Better than working
for your mom.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.930
Let's just say, different.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.939
You still
in touch with...
Oh, God. No.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.274
I'm totally done with her.
Done with that.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.144
End of story.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.780
I was gonna say Niko.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.817
Oh. Right.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.720
Of course, I...

29:17.022 --> 29:19.289
Yeah, we see each other
every few days. He's...

29:21.761 --> 29:23.227
You know.
Yeah, I heard.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.295
And what about you?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.135
Do you ever worry
about The Twelve?

29:31.504 --> 29:33.544
There are plenty
of other people
worrying about them.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.006
But there's not. MI6 shut
everything down months ago.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.868
Yeah, well, it's not
my problem anymore.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.943
Yeah. Yeah,
not our problem.
Kenny, it's not.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.428
So I've been looking
into them loads.
No shit.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.252
And I was looking
at the financial
trial again.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.631
And the thing is,
after Fat Panda

29:49.655 --> 29:50.935
and Frank, there were...
Kenny...

29:51.056 --> 29:53.001
I've seen some activity
in their accounts that show...

29:53.025 --> 29:54.025
Kenny, I'm serious.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.470
I am not going down
that road again.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.627
It almost killed me.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.222
You should come to the office

30:14.246 --> 30:15.846
after work for beers.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.415
I'm there most evenings
and weekends.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.919
I think you could do
with people, or something.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.121
You don't seem
very, er...
No, Kenny, I'm fine.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.290
I know.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.724
You just don't seem
very happy. That's all.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.426
Who says I want to be happy?

30:31.664 --> 30:32.996
Bye.
Bye.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.166
Ahhh!

33:39.785 --> 33:41.218
Untouchable.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.719
Kenny!

34:20.993 --> 34:22.393
I thought you said
you were going to

34:22.428 --> 34:24.061
sort all this before we packed.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.730
I did.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.466
Memories.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.946
You see this,
and you're transported

34:31.969 --> 34:33.103
to a time of happiness?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.804
Yes.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.373
I'll sort it when I'm back.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.875
Now, you are the one
who persuaded me to
make this move,

34:39.110 --> 34:40.110
so you can just pitch in.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.279
The thing is, I've got
some work stuff to do.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.414
That website has you
working at the weekend?

34:44.683 --> 34:46.003
You had me working
at the weekend.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.145
That's because people get
murdered at the weekend.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.364
I'll see you when I'm back.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.054
As you wish.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.621
It is as I wish, actually.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.402
Right.
That's why I'm not staying.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.458
I think I got that.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.627
All right, then.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.167
Because I'm not gonna be told
what to do any more.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.368
Clearly.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.275
Are you ever going to apologise?

35:12.511 --> 35:13.810
I think I'm at a loss here.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.491
You really don't think
you did anything wrong
at all, do you?

35:16.515 --> 35:18.281
Your father chose our last house

35:18.550 --> 35:20.417
and to be honest,
I never liked it.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.719
But I lived
there for years
without complaint

35:22.988 --> 35:24.721
because I knew
it made him happy.

35:24.990 --> 35:29.159
Life is just a series
of trade-offs, Kenny.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.361
For all of us.

35:31.196 --> 35:32.329
And my job is no different.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.142
Now, you might disagree
with my decisions,

35:34.166 --> 35:36.766
but I will never be able
to apologise for them.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.214
And I'd have thought
that if anyone could
understand that,

35:39.238 --> 35:40.504
it's you.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.999
Now, do you want fish and chips
for when you come back?

35:45.844 --> 35:46.844
Okay.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.945
Battered sausage?
Yes, please.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.648
Right.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.588
And it's not a website.
It's an online publication.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.423
Oh, very good!

36:02.928 --> 36:04.208
How are you feeling today?

36:06.365 --> 36:07.631
He's in the garden.
Thank you.

36:18.243 --> 36:19.243
I brought you these.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.706
I ate the green ones for you.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.184
Thanks.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.718
They exchanged on the house.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.921
I've got some stuff
for you to sign.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.392
Just here.
I know.

36:35.561 --> 36:36.760
Eve...

36:37.663 --> 36:39.162
I'm not an idiot.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.631
We are going
to get through this.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.033
You have to know that.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.735
It's one day at a time,

36:46.038 --> 36:47.758
and you are getting better
with every day...

36:47.806 --> 36:50.507
This isn't something
you can fix, Eve.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.076
Her parents think
she killed herself,
you know that?

36:54.646 --> 36:57.881
Also, MI bloody six
can wash their hands...

36:58.183 --> 37:00.984
It's better if
her family don't know.
Better for who?

37:03.522 --> 37:06.189
Our entire relationship
has had you...

37:07.559 --> 37:08.825
At the centre of it.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.227
Well, I never wanted that...

37:10.529 --> 37:12.369
Well, you didn't do much
to change it, did you?

37:14.233 --> 37:15.273
And if we're being honest,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.434
we'd both admit
that I deserve more...

37:19.004 --> 37:20.103
A bit more than that.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.308
And more than you.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.358
She's lying. Okay?

38:15.694 --> 38:17.372
She was lying when
she had work the next day.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.636
She was lying when saw her mom.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.297
She was lying
when she had the flu.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.765
He knows it.

38:21.967 --> 38:22.967
I know it.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.601
You know it.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.503
You're not even crying
because of her.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.171
You're crying because...

38:28.874 --> 38:30.173
Because you feel stupid.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.475
Because you were stupid.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.831
Hey, these drinks
don't involve games,

38:55.067 --> 38:56.966
or organised fun, do they?

38:57.202 --> 38:59.602
Erm, it's pretty chill.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.839
Chilled works.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.809
<i>Okay, I'll get the...</i>

39:28.033 --> 39:29.833
Hello?

40:01.466 --> 40:02.632
Hello?

40:04.503 --> 40:05.735
Kenny?

40:08.807 --> 40:10.173
Hello?

40:26.491 --> 40:28.651
<i>Hi.
This is Kenny. Leave a message.</i>

40:28.827 --> 40:30.393
Hey. Erm, I'm here.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.163
Oh, I think I have your phone.

40:33.698 --> 40:34.698
Where are you?
