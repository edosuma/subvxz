-When you saw my fate, what did you see?
-You will lead this generation...

00:07.716 --> 00:10.048
...a silver age of heroism.

I started the training Jor-El
planned for me.

-Only the kind you make happen.

-No strings or ribbons.
-lt's just a gift.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.607
-l've been talking to The Blur.
-The question is: Am I enough?

You can't protect us

You shall be a savior of Kandor.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.237
The last thing we remember

-There are aliens here on our planet.

You get to write a story
with Perry White.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.670
You lied about having powers.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.173
-How'd you get them?
ZOD: From your blood.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.210
The time has come to share
in your birthright.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.504
Zod's looking for something
that wields power.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.718
-Who knows what he'll do?
-Humans killed...

00:59.893 --> 01:01.508
...the mother of my unborn child.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.975
-Last time I saw Faora, she was with Zod.
-Why should they believe you?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.434
The Book of Rao isn't here.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.272
You say you're saving the planet,
but you only care about yourself.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.607
The Book of Rao

-Anything.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.073

It was Zod.

If anyone calls
claiming to be me, don't believe them.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.834

Kneel before Zod.

...and Clark's at the deli, he wants to know
if you want pastrami or roast beef.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.745
Clark would forget his head
if it wasn't attached.

-Well, there's something else.
-Yes?

Your fate is utterly binding.

02:52.797 --> 02:56.836
You will lead this generation
as Hawkman once led ours.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.141
I thought you said
we'd never talk again.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.849
I'm glad you broke radio silence,
but why now?

That alien snatcher, Chisholm, shot you.

is the guy who's always saving my butt?

You were willing to risk your life
to save me, Lois.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.348
You are my hero.

05:54.645 --> 05:58.558

that said he was The Blur.

It's Clark Kent.

Sorry, I think all that super-speeding
has crisscrossed your wires...

06:28.137 --> 06:30.002
...because Clark
would never harm anyone.

I know you don't wanna see it,
Lois, but it's true.

06:33.601 --> 06:38.391
It's why he told you to stay away from me,
why he took away the charm I gave you.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.018
He knows what we mean to each other.

Clark Kent is not who he says he is.

Even though Watchtower's back,
I'm still coming up empty-handed...

07:18.646 --> 07:21.809
...on the Kandorian front.
It's like they vanished into thin air.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.599

to do with the fact that they can ﬂy.

Zod doesn't wanna play thunderdome
on a planet that's desolate.

Okay.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.673
Because, uh....

We're no match for the Kandorians.
It's a matter of time...

08:14.076 --> 08:17.239
...before Zod commands his soldiers
to bring the world to its knees.

08:17.413 --> 08:21.907
Then let's move on to plan A. I assume
you brought the infamous secret weapon.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.208
Wow.

I don't understand how the Red Queen
of the Kent farm...

08:30.134 --> 08:31.635
...knew about the Book of Rao.

08:31.802 --> 08:35.090
My mom inherited
the Kryptonian library when Lionel died.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.346
It's no surprise that Zod would lie.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.594
The Book of Rao is not a bible.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.852
It was created by Jor-El
to send the Kandorians to another world.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.603
A world they could call their own.

I've seen it. Dr. Fate has seen it too.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.706
And Jor-El has sent me
on trials to prove it.

09:27.608 --> 09:31.146
...has just been a preparation
for you to make the ultimate sacriﬁce?

09:32.196 --> 09:35.313
Then why would my father
have gone silent in the fortress?

09:35.491 --> 09:39.860
If this was a trial, my father would never
skip out on a chance to give me a lecture.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.449
Because this isn't a trial, Clark.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.583

18:08.796 --> 18:11.503
...say that our military friends
believe this is some hoax.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.083
Any new activity?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.760
This is Stargirl online
from the nation '8 capital.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.010
No sign of the Kandorians
after the attack.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.341
Black Canary here.
Story’s the same in Athens.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.347
All I found in Giza are mummies.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.134
We need to ﬂush these aliens out.

18:25.312 --> 18:29.476
I've been around long enough to know
the best way to win a war is to strike ﬁrst.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.936
That's the best way to win
a bowling tournament.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.067
We're dealing
with super-powered soldiers.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.354
As expected, Mr. Green Jeans
has gone yellow.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.238
The Kandorians are Clark's people.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.320
So we're not gonna take
any sort of action until he's with us.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.611
-Watchtower’s right.
-I agree with Hawkman.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.577
-Wait too long, they'll have the advantage.
-I say we hold off until Kal-El has-

18:47.751 --> 18:49.867
How long?
Long enough for them to wipe us out?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.376
Wait and the Kandorians win.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.290
-Sit tight till their next move.
-Zod's symbols say he wants a ﬁght.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.174
I say we move now and cause some pain.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.051
At what cost?

19:02.766 --> 19:06.133
Your abilities allow you to come back,
Carter, after you die...

19:06.311 --> 19:08.267
...but what about the others
on both sides?

19:08.438 --> 19:10.224
So you want us to play nice?

19:10.399 --> 19:13.732
The Kandorians have been
led astray by Zod.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.443
I don't wanna see them die...

19:16.613 --> 19:19.446
...any more
than I wanna lose any one of you.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.490
I will use the Book of Rao...

19:24.788 --> 19:26.119
...to send them all away.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.953
I've made my decision.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.958
And once I lead my people to another
world, I'll never be able to come back.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.672
You need to think about this.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.553
-What about your life here?
DINAH: There's gotta be another way.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.056
IMth us, you don't have to do this alone.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.514
This is the only peaceful way
to eliminate the threat.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.063
Without a war,
a war that no one will win...

19:53.233 --> 19:56.691
...once the Kandorians are gone,
there will be other threats to mankind.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.446
The world will need you.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.951
You'll have to work together to become
the team that you were meant to be.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.155
I once believed that my destiny
was here on Earth...

20:10.334 --> 20:13.371
...but now,
you need to accept that destiny for me.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.758
Clark's right.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.214
We'll protect the world, as one.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.093
It's been my honor to serve alongside
each and every one of you.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.974
The honor was ours, Kai-El.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.322
I'm proud of you.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.275
Chloe?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.956
You gotta let her go, Clark.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.494
She's trying to be strong, you know?

20:54.253 --> 20:58.212
When your oldest friend leaves forever,
there's really no way to say goodbye.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.676
That said, I think we both know there's
someone else you need to see one last time.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.508
Considering everything Lois and I have been
through, I don't think that's a good idea.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.893
Clark, you owe her the truth.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.189
I wanna open up to her
more than anything.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.695
But why tell Lois who I really am
only to rip it away from her?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.530
Wouldn't that hurt her more?

21:25.909 --> 21:27.615
I wouldn't do that to her.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.289
That doesn't mean
you can't at least say goodbye.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.962
General.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.382
Have you retrieved the Book of Rao?

21:53.854 --> 21:57.096
Sir, if Kal-El still holds it,
you said he'd use it to kill us all.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.107
Do not question my resolve.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.360
I will not fail.
I will destroy the Book of Rao.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.487
Do you not have a mission to complete?

22:06.658 --> 22:10.071
Kal-El's comrades have been lured
to your crests, just as you ordered.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.404
So they have to have been
dispersed around the world...

22:14.583 --> 22:17.495
...and Kal-EI is alone in Metropolis.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.502
Our soldiers have cutoff
their communications.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.418
All their satellites have been destroyed.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.007
Then by dawn,
we'll have the Book of Rao.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.894
And this planet will be ours.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.444
We lost all satellite communication.
I can't reach anybody.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.731
It's like everyone I sent
is a sitting duck...

22:48.909 --> 22:51.321
...and Zod's about to call a start
to hunting season.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.328
Take a breath. You've stared
down the barrel of a gun before.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.204
We're dealing with a hundred Clarks.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.707
I don't know if I can dodge
this speeding bullet.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.539
Well, you're not in it alone.
We're a team. You got me.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.921
Hey. Trust me.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.963
Thank you.
But I don't think talking me off a ledge...

23:09.137 --> 23:11.549
...is gonna help us
solve our technical difﬁculties.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.260
Okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.345
When Tess broke
into our clubhouse here...

23:16.520 --> 23:21.480
...I had Queen Industries launch an orbiter
dedicated to Watchtower.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.315
Wait a minute.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.946
-We have our own satellite?
-Yeah.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.948
-Why didn't you tell me this before?
-Well, it was sort of a gift.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.612
Uh--

23:33.787 --> 23:37.996
I guess giving you a sweater for your
birthday is sort of out of the question now.

23:39.167 --> 23:43.001
The satellite's up, but the transponders
haven't been initiated for downlink yet.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.548
So I'm gonna need to ﬂip
a couple of switches...

23:45.715 --> 23:48.047
...in order to be able to spy from the sky.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.051
So then we should just stay in touch
the old-fashioned way.

23:51.221 --> 23:55.180
I mean, if Zod has been trying
to destroy satellites from space...

23:55.350 --> 23:59.343
...he's not gonna be happy that you're
putting another satellite online.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.564
Do me a favor, okay?
Just keep a low proﬁle.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.357
I'm wearing green leather,
so I'll do my best.

24:27.966 --> 24:32.005
How could a guy who kept a journal
in high school ever hurt anyone?

24:46.526 --> 24:48.187
What?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.237
CLARK:
Lois?

25:02.292 --> 25:03.907
I've been looking all over for you.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.789
Funny. Me too.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.167
I have something I need to tell you.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.708
And if I don't tell you now...

25:14.095 --> 25:15.175
...I never will.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.838
I know that things have been
rocky between us, but....

25:19.768 --> 25:21.383
I'm listening.

25:22.729 --> 25:26.893
Look, my life has been full of relationships
that have ended too soon.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.143
And then when I went away last fall, I....

25:32.072 --> 25:34.404
Lois, I felt so lost.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.200
When I came back to the bullpen...

25:40.539 --> 25:42.575
...you were there waiting for me.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.576
You jumped out of your seat,
you threw your arms around me...

25:47.754 --> 25:51.212
...and the way that your eyes sparkled
when you smiled, I just....

25:52.551 --> 25:53.586
I knew.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.470
I just knew that you were the one
that I've always needed.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.303
And I needed you to know that.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.182
What is it?

26:09.859 --> 26:11.520
Perry White.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.858
He's offered me a job
at the foreign desk in Kenya.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.627
That's great. Congratulations.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.672
Well, I'm-- I'm not sure I'm going.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.797
Well, Lois, your, uh....

26:42.350 --> 26:45.934
Your career is so important to you,
what would make you stay?

26:46.896 --> 26:49.228
For you. I....

26:49.858 --> 26:51.723
I would stay for you.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.396
Clark, as important
as my career is to me...

26:58.617 --> 27:00.858
...you are more important.

27:02.412 --> 27:07.076
I would give up Africa to be with you.

27:10.128 --> 27:14.167
But only if we stop keeping secrets
from each other.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.257
Lois, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:23.683 --> 27:26.140
Yeah, you do, Clark.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.980
Come on.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.979
I need you to be honest with me.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.860
Lois, there's nothing to tell you.

27:44.871 --> 27:49.035
I think you leaving Metropolis
is the best thing for you right now.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.549
Just know that wherever you are,
I'll be watching over you.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.009
I'll be thinking of you.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.060
I'm
sorry

28:13.149 --> 28:14.935
I should go.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.534
NURSE: Doctor!
-Bring the crash cart!

28:33.712 --> 28:35.418
NURSE: Blood pressure's dropping.
-Oxygen.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.715
NURSE:
She's down to 50 percent.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.383
DOCTOR:
Hurry up. We're losing her.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.507
Ten mil epi. Charge to 200.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.255
NURSE: Charging.
DOCTOR: Clear.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.421
NURSE: No pulse. No response.
DOCTOR: Charge to 250.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.179
NURSE: Got it.
DOCTOR: Clear.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.136
No response.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.722
Let's call it.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.310
Time of death: 3:33 PM.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.690
Call the morgue.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.477
Have them send somebody up
to collect the body.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.297
OLIVER [OVER RADIO]:
Houston, we got a problem.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.299
Are you at the satellite station yet?

29:23.470 --> 29:26.257
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you,
but I'm a little lost.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.098
I need you to be my own
personal MapQuest if you don't mind.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.804
All right, what's your 20?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.718
l'rn inside the air ducts right now.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.855
Access to the main grid
is through one of the routing panels.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.516
Okay, just think happy thoughts
and keep on tunneling.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.525
Let me know when you've reached the T.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.608
I hate small spaces.

29:46.409 --> 29:49.367
Okay, completed the ﬁrst level.
I'm at the T.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.662
Halfway through the second tunnel,
on your left-hand side...

29:52.832 --> 29:54.493
...you're gonna ﬁnd three panels.

29:54.667 --> 29:58.285
The one with JJ-dash-910-dash-60 is-

29:58.463 --> 30:00.499
The one in the middle. Yeah, I got it.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.501
I know how to treat a girl on date night.

30:06.679 --> 30:10.422
Next week, maybe we could
just grab Thai food and catch a movie?

30:12.769 --> 30:14.225
That sounds like a good plan...

30:14.395 --> 30:17.979
...but for tonight, you're gonna have
to settle for stream satellite-video.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.521
Hey, the link is up.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.732
Why don't you make your way home?
I'm gonna see if I can access...

30:25.907 --> 30:29.070
...the building schematics and ﬁnd you
a less cramped return trip.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.735
Ah, the station's motion sensors
have picked you up.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.487
[BEEPING]

30:35.083 --> 30:37.825
Oh, no. Ollie, you've got visitors.
There's a swarm of them.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.745
They're closing in on you fast.
Ollie, you need to get out of there now.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.634
Chloe, if they ﬁnd the signal,
they'll trace me back to you.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.920
-I gotta go.
-No, Ollie, no.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.469
-Chloe.
-Ollie!

30:54.644 --> 30:57.386
-I love you.
-I love you.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.392
Chloe, they're not Kandorian.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.095
Lois.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.099
ZOD:
I knew I could count on you.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.814
I still can't believe
you were right about Clark.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.029
Just when it seems
that you're out of my life...

31:54.203 --> 31:56.785
...you turn out to be the one person
I can believe in.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.456
My only regret
is I can see your heartbreak.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.838
It's not broken.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.587
It's shattered.

32:13.598 --> 32:17.682
I know how hard it is
to discover the person you love...

32:18.561 --> 32:21.223
...is not what you think they were.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.940
I will never deceive you
like Clark did, ever.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.692
Now, I need the Book of Rao.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.584
I can't. I hid it.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.674
I was worried that Clark
would follow me.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.709
Then where is it?

32:54.097 --> 32:55.837
I hid it where I confessed to you...

32:56.015 --> 32:59.223
...that you were
the most important person in my life.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.473
This is not a game.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.184
You're not really him.

33:16.202 --> 33:19.945
I should've known better than to deceive
The Blur's most devoted follower.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.662
Just who the hell are you?

33:21.833 --> 33:25.951
Unlike The Blur, I'm someone
who doesn't care whether you live or die.

34:38.951 --> 34:41.784
Can you ever forgive me
for thinking he was you?

34:48.711 --> 34:50.747
Please say something.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.165
Anything.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.424
Clark.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.740
You can't stop me.
We're leaving this planet.

36:02.910 --> 36:06.573
I'm not going anywhere.
And neither are they.

36:27.810 --> 36:32.679
Having others ﬁnish a ﬁght that you
started only proves what a coward you are.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.731
My soldiers know I have never wavered
in the face of death.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.688
All you've done is hide in the shadow.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.773
You've hidden too.

36:39.947 --> 36:42.199
The truth, from them.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.242
The Book of Rao will not destroy us.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.448
It will lead us to a better place...

36:48.623 --> 36:51.080
...another planet
where we can live in peace...

36:51.250 --> 36:53.741
...where we can build a new home.
