<i>Kids,</i>

00:02.327 --> 00:04.977
<i>your Uncle Barney went off</i>
<i>the grid for a couple weeks.</i>

00:04.982 --> 00:07.015
<i>So I was relieved</i>
<i>when I got a text</i>

00:07.017 --> 00:08.684
<i>asking me to come over</i>
<i>to his place.</i>

00:08.686 --> 00:10.319
Glad to hear from you, buddy.

00:10.321 --> 00:13.238
I was worried something
bad happened...

00:14.240 --> 00:15.357
...to you.

00:15.359 --> 00:16.891
Welcome, brother.

00:16.893 --> 00:18.243
What is this?

00:18.245 --> 00:21.914
Ted Evelyn Mosby,

00:21.916 --> 00:23.165
you are about to be
sworn to secrecy

00:23.167 --> 00:26.251
through the sacred vows
of a Bro Oath,

00:26.253 --> 00:28.537
or "Broath."

00:29.289 --> 00:32.424
Please, put on
your "brobe."

00:32.426 --> 00:34.593
Yeah, I'm not putting on
the "brobe."

00:34.595 --> 00:36.295
Ted, just...

00:36.297 --> 00:38.747
just... Okay?

00:38.749 --> 00:41.967
♪ Broooo... ♪

00:41.969 --> 00:44.720
Wait, are they chanting "bro"?

00:44.722 --> 00:46.087
♪ Bro... ♪

00:46.089 --> 00:48.089
I got some local monks
to record this.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.725
Yeah! I got a monk guy.

00:49.727 --> 00:50.726
Cool, right?

00:50.728 --> 00:51.977
It actually is, yeah.

00:51.979 --> 00:53.195
I'll burn it for you.

00:53.197 --> 00:55.030
Just remind me after The Broath.

00:55.032 --> 00:57.616
Anyway, Ted Evelyn Mosby,

00:57.618 --> 01:02.937
this ritual forever binds you
to keep a solemn secret...

01:02.939 --> 01:04.239
Which is?

01:04.241 --> 01:05.874
I really like this Quinn girl!

01:05.876 --> 01:07.993
We've been spending
tons of time together,

01:07.995 --> 01:09.444
and I want the gang to meet her.

01:09.446 --> 01:11.213
but I'm afraid they're
gonna disapprove because,

01:11.215 --> 01:14.633
- well, you know.
<i>- I did know. You see,</i>

01:14.635 --> 01:16.268
<i>Quinn was a stripper...</i>

01:16.270 --> 01:19.338
<i>who had swindled Barney out of</i>
<i>quite a bit of cash.</i>

01:19.340 --> 01:21.256
We're inviting everyone
to dinner at Quinn's,

01:21.258 --> 01:22.975
and I want them to
keep an open mind,

01:22.977 --> 01:24.459
which brings us to The Broath.

01:24.461 --> 01:27.596
Place your hand
on The Bro Code.

01:27.598 --> 01:29.314
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:29.316 --> 01:31.466
Repeat after me.

01:31.468 --> 01:35.187
I, Ted Evelyn Mosby...

01:35.189 --> 01:39.441
"I, Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You
My Middle Name" Mosby..."

01:39.443 --> 01:42.077
...solemnly swear not to
tell our friends

01:42.079 --> 01:43.478
that Quinn is
a stripper.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.480
"...solemnly swear not
to tell our friends

01:45.482 --> 01:48.533
that Quinn is a stripper" who
duped you out of lots of money.

01:48.535 --> 01:50.118
You're only supposed
to repeat after me.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.620
"You're only supposed
to repeat after me."

01:51.622 --> 01:52.621
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

01:52.623 --> 01:54.956
Silence!

01:54.958 --> 01:57.926
Look, I know that things
started out sketchy

01:57.928 --> 02:00.262
with me and Quinn, but
I really like her, so please.

02:00.264 --> 02:02.163
Do you,

02:02.165 --> 02:06.435
Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,

02:06.437 --> 02:09.687
swear to uphold this Broath?

02:10.273 --> 02:11.907
I do.

02:11.909 --> 02:14.943
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

Okay, time to go to
Quinn's. Now remember,

02:29.777 --> 02:31.326
I told you nothing, okay?

02:31.328 --> 02:33.061
Barney really wants
us all to like her.

02:33.063 --> 02:34.446
But how can we?

02:34.448 --> 02:37.032
Quinn totally duped Barney,
and he couldn't even see it.

02:37.034 --> 02:39.401
Well, apparently, the sex
is mind-blowing.

02:39.403 --> 02:42.237
Ha, I've been there.
Yeah.

02:42.239 --> 02:43.872
I was once with this chick

02:43.874 --> 02:46.708
who answered the door wearing
nothing but, uh, whipped cream,

02:46.710 --> 02:49.077
a dog collar
and a hot pink thong.

02:49.079 --> 02:50.295
Marshall,

02:50.297 --> 02:52.080
you can't tell sex stories

02:52.082 --> 02:53.465
about "this chick," because

02:53.467 --> 02:54.949
everyone knows it's me.

02:54.951 --> 02:56.784
I'm the only woman
you've ever been with.

02:56.786 --> 02:59.621
It's not fair, the guys are
always telling their sex stories

02:59.623 --> 03:01.223
and I can top
every one of them.

03:01.225 --> 03:04.426
Baby, you're like 20 slutty
chicks all rolled into one.

03:04.428 --> 03:06.678
Sweet talk is not going
to change my mind.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.963
Let's focus.

03:08.965 --> 03:10.315
Tonight, we want to make sure

03:10.317 --> 03:12.567
that Quinn is not
out to scam Barney.

03:12.569 --> 03:14.653
So, when we walk back
through that door

03:14.655 --> 03:17.022
three hours from now,
we should all be able

03:17.024 --> 03:19.241
to answer one
simple question:

03:21.244 --> 03:23.411
Do we trust this girl?

03:23.413 --> 03:24.613
Well, for one thing,

03:24.615 --> 03:26.498
she seems kind of controlling.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.651
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

03:29.653 --> 03:31.036
No, save it for dessert.

03:31.038 --> 03:32.454
Idiot.

03:34.341 --> 03:36.374
Uh, ah...

03:36.376 --> 03:38.460
More red wine, beauty-swan?

03:38.462 --> 03:40.995
She drinks a lot.

03:41.781 --> 03:43.598
Is it okay if I
go pee, sugar lamb?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.666
No!

03:44.668 --> 03:46.334
You just went three hours ago.

03:46.336 --> 03:48.303
You're right, baby bear!

03:52.109 --> 03:54.476
Yes, so Barney's whipped;
it doesn't mean

03:54.478 --> 03:56.561
that Quinn is a con artist.

03:56.563 --> 03:59.013
Well, maybe we could've gotten
a better read on her

03:59.015 --> 04:01.700
if two people
hadn't gone off topic.

04:01.702 --> 04:04.236
By the way, Quinn,
your apartment is amazing.

04:04.238 --> 04:05.853
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

04:05.855 --> 04:08.123
I'm actually moving out soon.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.908
If you know anyone
looking for a sublet,

04:09.910 --> 04:10.876
this place is rent-controlled.

04:10.878 --> 04:12.544
You would not believe
what I pay.

04:12.546 --> 04:14.362
<i>Kids,</i>
<i>things have been tense</i>

04:14.364 --> 04:15.997
<i>between Robin and I for weeks.</i>

04:15.999 --> 04:17.716
<i>Ever since she moved out,</i>

04:17.718 --> 04:20.302
<i>and I gave the apartment</i>
<i>to Marshall and Lily,</i>

04:20.303 --> 04:22.888
<i>I'd been crashing</i>
<i>in university housing.</i>

04:22.890 --> 04:25.056
It's 10:00,
damn it.

04:25.058 --> 04:26.541
Ned, Martin and Millie,

04:26.543 --> 04:28.209
people are trying to sleep!

04:28.211 --> 04:31.313
Hey, you were young
like us once, right?

04:31.315 --> 04:34.683
I was never like you guys.

04:34.685 --> 04:37.903
<i>And Robin was staying</i>
<i>with her coworker, Patrice.</i>

04:37.905 --> 04:39.654
You seem so down today, Robin.

04:39.656 --> 04:41.106
I made you cookies.

04:41.108 --> 04:43.725
Damn it, Patrice,
stop smothering me!

04:44.994 --> 04:47.412
<i>So, when Quinn said</i>
<i>her apartment was available...</i>

04:49.398 --> 04:50.699
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!

04:50.701 --> 04:51.833
Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!

04:51.835 --> 04:54.836
We got off topic?
What about Marshall?

04:54.838 --> 04:56.538
Hey, I was just
going along with

04:56.540 --> 04:58.757
whoever suggested
we play that game.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.041
Hey, let's play a game!

05:00.043 --> 05:02.627
Uh, craziest
sex-in-public story; I'll start.

05:02.629 --> 05:04.429
I was once with this chick

05:04.431 --> 05:06.848
who loved to get freaky
in elevators.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.249
Doors would close;
suddenly,

05:08.251 --> 05:11.469
she's panting on all fours
like a dog in heat.

05:13.656 --> 05:15.557
Marshall, stop.

05:15.559 --> 05:17.142
I never said that it was you.

05:17.144 --> 05:19.144
Okay, so anyway, last August,

05:19.146 --> 05:21.363
I go bareback
with this same slut.

05:21.365 --> 05:24.316
She get's pregnant;
bitch is even hornier.

05:25.134 --> 05:27.101
Oh, yeah? I was once
with this dude

05:27.103 --> 05:29.237
who I caught eating
a sandwich during sex.

05:29.239 --> 05:30.705
Big ol' meatball

05:30.707 --> 05:32.707
falls out, lands on my back,

05:32.709 --> 05:34.942
rolls on to the elevator floor.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.111
Hmm. Disgusting, right?

05:37.797 --> 05:40.882
What, I never said it was you.

05:40.884 --> 05:44.085
Yeah, sorry we didn't stay
as laser-focused as you guys.

05:44.087 --> 05:46.454
Hey, at least I got
some evidence.

05:46.456 --> 05:49.057
Look what I found
in Quinn's bedroom.

05:49.059 --> 05:50.976
Barney's taking her to Hawaii.

05:50.978 --> 05:52.894
Lily, you snooped
through her stuff?

05:52.896 --> 05:55.180
No. It's like
the first thing you see

05:55.182 --> 05:57.899
when you jimmy open her desk
drawer with a letter opener

05:57.901 --> 06:00.635
her grandfather left her,
according to her diary.

06:00.637 --> 06:02.070
First-class tickets,

06:02.072 --> 06:04.439
a four-star hotel--
this cost Barney a fortune.

06:04.441 --> 06:08.142
Yeah, this proves that Quinn is
totally using him for his money.

06:08.144 --> 06:09.644
You know what Lily, enough.

06:09.646 --> 06:12.146
Guys, even if you're right
about Quinn, this is Barney.

06:12.148 --> 06:13.281
He'll come to his senses.

06:13.283 --> 06:15.784
I give this whole thing
a week, two weeks, tops.

06:15.786 --> 06:18.169
And now, we have
an announcement.

06:18.171 --> 06:18.953
Can I tell them?

06:18.955 --> 06:20.622
No.

06:20.624 --> 06:21.790
We're moving in together
We're m...

06:21.792 --> 06:25.510
Congrats! That's great.
So happy for you.

06:25.512 --> 06:27.161
We gotta end this.

06:27.163 --> 06:29.197
Yup.

06:30.192 --> 06:31.725
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

06:31.798 --> 06:34.582
<i>our gang had a subtle way</i>
<i>of letting someone know</i>

06:34.584 --> 06:36.367
<i>they were making a mistake.</i>

06:37.989 --> 06:39.172
Where have you been?

06:39.459 --> 06:41.543
Oh, worth it. Hang on.

06:41.545 --> 06:43.662
Hey.

06:50.052 --> 06:52.287
You know we would've
hated ourselves, right?

06:53.973 --> 06:55.623
So,

06:55.625 --> 06:58.593
did Robin tell you the incredibly
devious thing she did today?

06:58.595 --> 06:59.778
Me?!

07:00.796 --> 07:03.148
Hey, so I just happened
to be in the neighborhood

07:03.150 --> 07:05.934
and I thought, "Man, Quinn
is in such great shape,

07:05.936 --> 07:07.802
she must love fruit."

07:08.689 --> 07:10.488
So, unrelated,

07:10.490 --> 07:12.240
how's the search for
a sub-letter going?

07:12.242 --> 07:15.744
This is such a
weird coincidence!

07:15.746 --> 07:18.029
Robin also "just happened"
to be in the neighborhood

07:18.031 --> 07:21.816
with a bottle of wine
and her credit scores.

07:27.924 --> 07:29.541
I can't believe you two.

07:29.543 --> 07:31.843
What do you care about more,
protecting your friend

07:31.845 --> 07:34.629
from getting hurt or scoring
this girl's apartment?

07:34.631 --> 07:36.214
There's a working fireplace!

07:36.216 --> 07:38.967
Patrice is ironing
my pants all wrong!

07:38.969 --> 07:40.802
You guys should be ashamed.

07:40.804 --> 07:42.604
Speaking of shame,

07:42.606 --> 07:45.173
I was once with this chick
who liked to do hand stuff

07:45.175 --> 07:46.891
underneath a jacket
while we were all

07:46.893 --> 07:48.693
sitting around our
favorite booth at MacLaren's.

07:48.695 --> 07:49.861
Gross.

07:49.863 --> 07:51.696
We share appetizers.

07:51.698 --> 07:54.449
Okay, well, I was once
with a dude

07:54.451 --> 07:57.018
who couldn't even fantasize
about a three-way.

07:57.020 --> 07:59.321
He was all,
"Ew, she's your best friend."

07:59.323 --> 08:00.288
What now?

08:00.290 --> 08:01.706
I was once with a
chick who wanted

08:01.708 --> 08:04.793
to get it on during a school
production of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan.</i>

08:04.795 --> 08:06.845
Well, I...
Wait, that wasn't me.

08:08.130 --> 08:10.131
So, back to Patrice
and this ironing issue...

08:10.133 --> 08:12.834
I thought I was the first girl
you ever did anything with.

08:12.836 --> 08:14.252
Anything serious.

08:14.254 --> 08:15.804
Please don't tell me that
you're jealous of me getting

08:15.806 --> 08:19.057
to second base in tenth grade
with Jenna Cristalli.

08:19.059 --> 08:22.344
Don't say that whore's name
in front of our baby.

08:23.312 --> 08:24.729
What's going on?

08:25.931 --> 08:28.566
Barney, this in an intervention.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.386
A "Quinntervention."

08:32.389 --> 08:36.557
You and Quinn are moving really
fast, and we don't trust her.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.592
We're just looking out
for your best interests.

08:41.498 --> 08:44.099
"Quinn-terests."

08:44.101 --> 08:46.334
I don't understand. Wh...

08:46.336 --> 08:48.086
Wait a sec.

08:48.088 --> 08:50.505
Ted Evelyn Mosby...

08:50.507 --> 08:53.124
you broke The Broath.

08:53.126 --> 08:54.709
How dare you?!

08:54.711 --> 08:59.047
A Broath is the most sacred bond
between-- okay, yeah, I did.

08:59.049 --> 09:01.916
Are you aware that
breaking a Broath

09:01.918 --> 09:05.720
can have deadly,
even fatal repercussions?

09:05.722 --> 09:07.756
Have you studied history, Ted?

09:07.758 --> 09:09.424
Extensively.
But I'm a little shaky

09:09.426 --> 09:10.758
on fake history, so...

09:10.760 --> 09:12.640
The tragic cost of
a broken Broath

09:12.665 --> 09:13.279
Uh-huh.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.115
dates back to
Ancient Bro-man times...

09:19.035 --> 09:21.036
Hey, Bro-tus,

09:21.038 --> 09:23.455
you'd tell me if,
like, a bunch of dudes

09:23.457 --> 09:25.874
were conspiring to
assassinate me, right?

09:25.876 --> 09:29.294
Um, totally, Caesar.

09:29.296 --> 09:31.713
Paranoid much?

09:31.715 --> 09:33.948
Just to be sure,

09:33.950 --> 09:36.301
can you swear
a Broath to me?

09:36.303 --> 09:38.586
Sure. I swear.

09:38.588 --> 09:40.955
Thanks.

09:40.957 --> 09:43.174
You've always got my back.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.074

10:03.529 --> 10:06.781
<i>Et tu, Bro-te?</i>

10:10.903 --> 10:13.671
And then he banged,
like, a hundred chicks

10:13.673 --> 10:15.840
and invented a salad.

10:15.842 --> 10:17.325
True story.

10:17.327 --> 10:20.428
Well, Quinn lied to you;
she manipulated you.

10:20.430 --> 10:22.097
What if she's just using you?

10:22.099 --> 10:23.515
She's not just using me.

10:23.517 --> 10:25.333
What about the expensive
trip to Hawaii?

10:25.335 --> 10:27.936
What expensive trip to Hawaii?

10:27.938 --> 10:30.271
The one I got for you.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.358
That was supposed to be
a surprise for Barney.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.810
He asked me to meet him here.

10:35.812 --> 10:38.179
What's going on, you guys?

10:38.181 --> 10:40.031
Tell her.

10:41.117 --> 10:43.351
Fine,
I'll fill her in.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.487
And I am so angry,

10:45.489 --> 10:48.656
I'm not even gonna make a joke
about "filling her in."

10:48.658 --> 10:51.042
Which I did three times
last night, self-five.

10:51.044 --> 10:53.711
My friends think
you're wrong for me,

10:53.713 --> 10:55.663
so they're having
an intervention.

10:58.218 --> 11:00.668
A "Quinntervention."

11:00.670 --> 11:02.337
I don't understand.

11:02.339 --> 11:05.089
Well, see, your name
is Quinn, and so...

11:05.091 --> 11:06.758
I'll explain.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.979
I made Ted promise not to tell
them what you do, but he did,

11:10.981 --> 11:12.680
and now they don't trust you.

11:12.682 --> 11:16.184
Wow, that really hurts.

11:16.186 --> 11:17.368
But what's even worse

11:17.370 --> 11:20.555
is that you felt
the need to lie about me.

11:20.557 --> 11:22.857
I'm not ashamed of
who I am, Barney,

11:22.859 --> 11:24.892
but you clearly are.

11:24.894 --> 11:26.077
I'm not ashamed of you.

11:26.079 --> 11:28.329
I just didn't want them
to judge you without...

11:28.331 --> 11:30.165
Maybe we are moving too fast.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.233
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

11:32.235 --> 11:34.202
I don't think I can do this.

11:34.204 --> 11:37.589
Wait, are you ending things
just like that?

11:37.591 --> 11:40.875
If you walk out that door,
you prove them right.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.760
You prove that you're just
some heartless stripper

11:42.762 --> 11:45.029
who never gave a damn about me
in the...

11:47.249 --> 11:49.584
Don't call me.

11:52.055 --> 11:56.090
Wow. That
was intense.

12:01.865 --> 12:04.350
We just destroyed
what could have been

12:04.352 --> 12:07.203
a once-in-a-lifetime shot
at happiness.

12:07.205 --> 12:09.505
I know. I feel guilty, too.

12:09.507 --> 12:12.041
Fireplace, balcony,

12:12.043 --> 12:13.576
hardwood floors...

12:14.478 --> 12:15.511
Okay, I'll just say it:

12:15.513 --> 12:17.113
After everything that
happened between us,

12:17.115 --> 12:18.164
I can't believe
you wouldn't

12:18.166 --> 12:20.616
back down and let me
have Quinn's place.

12:20.618 --> 12:23.619
Ted, can I talk to you
out in the hall?

12:24.654 --> 12:28.007
Has it ever occurred to you

12:28.009 --> 12:30.960
that the last few weeks haven't
been easy for me either?

12:30.962 --> 12:34.597
In the span of one day,
my engagement fell apart,

12:34.599 --> 12:37.350
I lost my best friend,
then I lost my apartment.

12:37.352 --> 12:39.652
And-and now I'm about
to lose my job.

12:39.654 --> 12:40.686
What do you mean?

12:41.839 --> 12:44.991
I-I've been completely
distracted at work.

12:44.993 --> 12:48.394
And now my boss wants to see me
Friday at 5:00,

12:48.396 --> 12:51.614
which, around the office,
is known as "fire o'clock."

12:51.616 --> 12:53.399
I had no idea.

12:53.401 --> 12:54.667
How could you?

12:54.669 --> 12:57.987
The one person I want to talk
to most barely looks me

12:57.989 --> 13:00.590
in the eye anymore,
much less returns my calls.

13:00.592 --> 13:04.043
Ted, I know it took guts
to tell me you love me.

13:04.045 --> 13:07.863
And I-I know how much it hurt
that I didn't say it back,

13:07.865 --> 13:09.465
but...

13:09.467 --> 13:13.402
Damn it, th-this sucks
for me, too.

13:13.404 --> 13:16.138
And I-I miss you.

13:17.240 --> 13:22.545
Is there any way we can just...
go back to normal?

13:22.547 --> 13:27.984
I don't think
I can do normal anymore.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.356
Barney still
isn't answering.

13:33.358 --> 13:36.225
We gotta go find him
and apologize.

13:38.896 --> 13:42.415
Oh. I thought you were Quinn.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.667
Barney, we're so sorry.

13:44.669 --> 13:46.735
We never should've
meddled like that.

13:46.737 --> 13:48.504
Can you forgive us?
I don't know.

13:48.506 --> 13:50.289
You had no right to do that.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.091
How can we make it
up to you, buddy?

13:54.128 --> 13:57.880
I, one of Barney's
best friends...

13:57.882 --> 14:00.716
"I, one of Barney's
best friends..."

14:00.718 --> 14:04.470
...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again...

14:04.472 --> 14:08.708
"...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again..."

14:08.710 --> 14:12.311
...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

14:12.313 --> 14:14.113
or he's about to get up
on a fattie.

14:14.115 --> 14:18.600
"...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

14:18.602 --> 14:21.603
or he's about to
get up on a fattie."

14:21.605 --> 14:25.992
And now, to seal
this sacred vow,

14:25.994 --> 14:27.793
the two ladies will kiss.
Barney...

14:27.795 --> 14:30.612
The two ladies will kiss!

14:34.334 --> 14:35.885
Mmm.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.454
Lil...

14:38.456 --> 14:40.006
Okay.

14:40.008 --> 14:41.290
And now the gentlemen.

14:41.292 --> 14:42.558
Dude...

14:42.560 --> 14:44.927
And now the gentlemen!

14:44.929 --> 14:49.315
Let's just...
This is silly.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.569
Don't-don't touch
my face.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.474
I was going to say,

14:58.476 --> 15:00.142
"And now the gentlemen
bump fists."

15:00.144 --> 15:01.944
How long you been holding
back that one?

15:01.946 --> 15:05.197
Hot stuff, fellas.

15:05.199 --> 15:07.233
Did I see a little tongue
in there?

15:08.118 --> 15:09.835
I don't understand.

15:09.837 --> 15:11.087
Well, if these two

15:11.089 --> 15:13.172
will keep their sweaty paws
off each other

15:13.174 --> 15:14.423
for half a second, I'll explain.

15:14.425 --> 15:16.325
It all started
a couple days ago...

15:16.327 --> 15:17.993
I want you to meet
my friends.

15:17.995 --> 15:19.595
Should I be nervous?

15:19.597 --> 15:21.514
Is it like bringing me home
to meet your parents?

15:21.516 --> 15:22.631
No, no, no.

15:22.633 --> 15:24.166
Much more stressful than that.

15:24.168 --> 15:26.602
You see, my friends, while
awesome, can be presumptuous,

15:26.604 --> 15:28.938
meddlesome and
downright destructive.

15:28.940 --> 15:31.357
When they learn what
you do and how we met,

15:31.359 --> 15:32.808
they'll probably try
to break us up.

15:32.810 --> 15:35.027
So let's have
some fun with them.

15:35.029 --> 15:36.512
Mess with their heads.

15:36.514 --> 15:39.648
Are you saying...
evil plan?

15:39.650 --> 15:41.283
Hells to the yes.

15:41.285 --> 15:43.486
My God, you're hot.

15:43.488 --> 15:44.520
Wait for it.

15:44.522 --> 15:46.205
Here's what we do.

15:46.207 --> 15:49.542
<i>I'll make Ted swear not to tell</i>
<i>anyone what he knows about you,</i>

15:49.544 --> 15:51.193
<i>and he'll cave immediately.</i>

15:51.195 --> 15:53.279
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

15:53.281 --> 15:54.280
<i>Next, we invite everyone over.</i>

15:54.282 --> 15:55.915
<i>I'll keep saying stuff like:</i>

15:55.917 --> 15:57.883
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

15:57.885 --> 15:59.385
<i>And I'll be the bossy</i>
<i>bitch who says:</i>

15:59.387 --> 16:01.921
No, save it for dessert, idiot.

16:01.923 --> 16:03.205
<i>Nice.</i>

16:03.207 --> 16:04.590
<i>And, finally, we'll announce...</i>

16:04.592 --> 16:06.158
We're moving in together!

16:06.160 --> 16:07.510
I've got an idea.

16:07.512 --> 16:09.178
Let's get your friends
Ted and Robin

16:09.180 --> 16:10.479
fighting over my apartment.

16:10.481 --> 16:12.548
Wait, what does that have
to do with you and me?

16:12.550 --> 16:14.066
Nothing. I just
worship chaos.

16:14.068 --> 16:15.901
I can't handle how hot
you are right now.

16:15.903 --> 16:18.104
Wait for it.
Next,

16:18.106 --> 16:20.773
<i>they'll try to talk me</i>
<i>into dumping you.</i>

16:20.775 --> 16:22.057
<i>And I'll walk in on it.</i>

16:22.059 --> 16:22.992
<i>Then we pretend to break up.</i>

16:22.994 --> 16:24.610
<i>And when they crawl back,</i>

16:24.612 --> 16:25.978
<i>begging for forgiveness...</i>

16:25.980 --> 16:28.114
<i>I'll be the bigger man</i>
<i>and let them off the hook.</i>

16:28.116 --> 16:30.583
<i>Or make the monkeys</i>
<i>dance for you.</i>

16:30.585 --> 16:32.535
<i>God, you're smart!</i>

16:32.537 --> 16:35.004
It's gonna be legen...

16:35.006 --> 16:37.790
I'm not waiting for
it anymore. Mmm...

16:37.792 --> 16:39.942
...dary.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.579
My God, you two are...

16:43.581 --> 16:45.097
Perfect together.

16:45.099 --> 16:47.049
So you're not really moving in?

16:47.051 --> 16:48.601
Well, it started
out as a joke,

16:48.603 --> 16:50.386
but the more we
talked about it...

16:50.388 --> 16:51.937
The more excited we got.

16:51.939 --> 16:54.256
So, yeah, we are.

16:54.258 --> 16:57.359
You have anything
to say about that?

16:57.361 --> 17:00.279
So happy for you.
Congratulations.

17:02.199 --> 17:03.365
Thank you.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.867
Thank you.

17:05.652 --> 17:07.736
You two realize this means

17:07.738 --> 17:10.055
my apartment really is
up for grabs, right?

17:11.458 --> 17:13.409
I'm sure I'll find
something else.

17:13.411 --> 17:15.077
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.714
<i>And that's the story</i>
<i>of how we met Quinn.</i>

17:18.715 --> 17:22.718
<i>That Friday, I met Robin to see</i>
<i>how it went at "fire o'clock."</i>

17:22.720 --> 17:25.954
They promoted me
to on-air talent.

17:25.955 --> 17:27.955
I'm gonna be
Sandy Rivers' new co-host.

17:27.958 --> 17:29.291
Oh, my God!

17:29.293 --> 17:30.459
How'd that happen?

17:30.461 --> 17:31.510
Remember New Year's Eve?

17:31.512 --> 17:33.962
<i>When I filled in for Sandy,</i>
<i>it turns out</i>

17:33.964 --> 17:36.298
the C.E.O.
of <i>World Wide News</i> liked me.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.799
He said I have "moxie."

17:37.801 --> 17:39.602
So he's a 1940s gangster?

17:39.604 --> 17:40.969
Apparently.

17:40.971 --> 17:43.805
And I got a big raise,

17:43.807 --> 17:47.243
so I'm taking this apartment
on Central Park West,

17:47.245 --> 17:48.327
which means...

17:48.329 --> 17:49.695
Quinn's apartment.

17:49.697 --> 17:51.096
I already told her
you'd take it.

17:51.098 --> 17:54.667
Wow. Thanks.

17:54.669 --> 17:55.668
Yeah.

17:55.670 --> 17:56.985
Hey, and congrats.

17:56.987 --> 17:58.737
You deserve it all.

17:59.823 --> 18:04.326
You know, I've been
thinking about it, and...

18:04.328 --> 18:05.844
I can do normal.

18:05.846 --> 18:07.880
To back to normal.

18:07.882 --> 18:08.714
To back to normal.

18:17.140 --> 18:20.676
Uh... I-I should get going.
Yeah.

18:20.678 --> 18:22.111
You've got a lot to do.
Totally.

18:22.113 --> 18:23.512
So...
Um, see you soon.

18:23.514 --> 18:24.346
See you soon.

18:24.348 --> 18:25.847
Yeah.

18:25.849 --> 18:28.150
<i>We wouldn't see each other</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

18:28.152 --> 18:31.186
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

18:31.188 --> 18:32.988
Listen, um...

18:32.990 --> 18:35.691
about me getting to second base
in tenth grade

18:35.693 --> 18:37.025
with Jenna Cristalli...

18:37.027 --> 18:38.544
I don't know what you're
talking about.

18:38.546 --> 18:41.046
I've already forgotten
about that dumb hobag.

18:41.048 --> 18:44.866
Yeah, um, it didn't happen while
we were watching <i>Peter Pan.</i>

18:44.868 --> 18:48.870
It happened while I was
playing Peter Pan.

18:48.872 --> 18:52.141
Here's a photo
from the day I was cast.

18:52.143 --> 18:54.376
That's me in the middle.

18:54.378 --> 18:56.378
But then I had my growth spurt.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.732
By opening night, I was too big
for the flying harness,

18:59.734 --> 19:01.900
and, well...

19:03.570 --> 19:08.357
I fell hands-first
right onto Jenna Cristalli.

19:08.359 --> 19:11.443
The tissues in her bra saved me
two broken wrists.

19:11.445 --> 19:12.861
I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted

19:12.863 --> 19:15.331
to have one cool
sex story that wasn't you.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.617
Okay. Next time you tell it,
you were in your dad's car,

19:18.619 --> 19:21.754
which you stole to go
to a Metallica concert,

19:21.756 --> 19:25.924
and you got to third base
with that slut.

19:27.794 --> 19:30.546
I was once with this chick...

19:30.548 --> 19:34.333
who is just
the best wife ever.

19:37.804 --> 19:40.105
Thank you for being so cool
about what I do.

19:40.107 --> 19:42.141
A lot of guys would be
weird or jealous.

19:42.143 --> 19:43.275
Are you kidding?

19:43.277 --> 19:45.594
Who am I to judge
anyone? I'm the devil!

19:49.816 --> 19:51.116
I mean, if you ever

19:51.118 --> 19:53.101
wanted to stop stripping,
I'd support it.

19:53.103 --> 19:55.571
- If you wanted... to.
- Uh-huh.

19:55.573 --> 19:57.706
So, you are jealous?

19:57.708 --> 19:59.792
What? No, no, not at all.

19:59.794 --> 20:01.794
I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted to hang up

20:01.796 --> 20:04.496
the ol' G-string,
I'd completely understand.

20:04.498 --> 20:07.383
Nah, I like taking my clothes
off for money.

20:07.385 --> 20:08.417
Great.

20:08.419 --> 20:10.836
Let me... let me finish.

20:10.838 --> 20:15.457
Hypothetically,
what would make you stop?

20:15.459 --> 20:17.726
Hypothetically...

20:17.728 --> 20:22.798
I would stop stripping
if I ever got married.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.066
Good night.

20:29.075 --> 20:31.860
And then we agreed
to "go back to normal."

20:33.240 --> 20:38.910
But I'm starting to wonder if we
can ever really just be friends.

20:38.912 --> 20:44.332
Anyway, that's the story of me
and Robin, 2005 to the present.

20:44.334 --> 20:45.667
What do you think?

20:45.669 --> 20:47.786
I think your stories
are way too long.

20:47.788 --> 20:52.223
I feel bad
for his future kids, dude.

20:52.225 --> 20:57.228
Hey, my kids are gonna
love my stories.

20:57.230 --> 21:01.149
They're gonna... yeah, they're
gonna love my stories.
