00:00.272 --> 00:03.355
(film reel clicking)

00:09.873 --> 00:12.540
(ominous music)

00:16.644 --> 00:19.561
(deep eerie music)

01:12.051 --> 01:15.968
(music increases in intensity)

01:35.922 --> 01:37.640
- Go.
(man groans)

01:37.640 --> 01:38.973
- Turn here.
- All right.

01:40.621 --> 01:43.788
(man in car chuckles)

01:46.354 --> 01:47.999
- [Man In Car] Let's go.

01:47.999 --> 01:51.499
(tense suspenseful music)

02:14.477 --> 02:15.807
- Who could that be?

02:15.807 --> 02:18.260
(pounding at door)

02:18.260 --> 02:20.297
We're not expecting any guests.

02:20.297 --> 02:23.986
(pounding at door)

02:23.986 --> 02:27.486
(tense suspenseful music)

02:34.950 --> 02:36.772
- Okay, move.

02:36.772 --> 02:37.865
(injured man groaning)

02:37.865 --> 02:39.240
- [Man In Plaid] Who else is in the house?

02:39.240 --> 02:40.310
- [Irene] My daughter and the doctor.

02:40.310 --> 02:42.537
- Doctor? Call him.

02:43.925 --> 02:46.879
- I'm Dr. Crumb. What's going on?

02:46.879 --> 02:47.731
- He's shot.

02:47.731 --> 02:49.423
(injured man gasping)

02:49.423 --> 02:51.513
- All right, all right. Take it easy.

02:52.980 --> 02:55.023
I'm gonna check your friend.

02:55.023 --> 02:58.448
(injured man groaning)

02:58.448 --> 03:01.143
All right. Okay, all
right. You'll be all right.

03:01.143 --> 03:03.960
You'll be all right. Just take it easy.

03:03.960 --> 03:04.966
Hold it here.

03:04.966 --> 03:08.049
(footsteps clomping)

03:09.400 --> 03:13.060
(Leonard grunts)
Lenny.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.047
- Let's fucking move now.

03:14.047 --> 03:14.880
- All right, all right.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.713
- Let's go.
- All right.

03:15.713 --> 03:16.893
Just take him this way, now.
- Let's go.

03:16.893 --> 03:18.890
- [Benjamin] This way.
My laboratory's this way.

03:18.890 --> 03:19.813
- Give me some tape.
- Take it easy, easy.

03:19.813 --> 03:21.203
- Give me some tape.

03:22.043 --> 03:24.543
(tense music)

03:27.000 --> 03:28.527
Sit down.

03:28.527 --> 03:31.027
(tense music)

03:38.332 --> 03:40.120
(intruder groans)

03:40.120 --> 03:41.570
I didn't mean to wake you up.

03:42.796 --> 03:45.023
Damn, you look good.

03:45.870 --> 03:49.090
Even in that granny gown. (laughs)

03:49.090 --> 03:50.133
Go upstairs.

03:51.183 --> 03:52.016
Go!

03:54.139 --> 03:55.097
- [Irene] No.

03:55.097 --> 03:55.930
- Turn around!

03:55.930 --> 03:57.513
Give me your hands.

04:03.902 --> 04:08.394
(fist strikes)
(intruder yells)

04:08.394 --> 04:11.394
(intruder laughing)

04:15.894 --> 04:17.138
(tape ripping)

04:17.138 --> 04:20.638
(tense suspenseful music)

04:28.958 --> 04:29.791
(Victoria screaming)

04:29.791 --> 04:32.624
(Leonard yelling)

04:34.815 --> 04:37.898
(Victoria screaming)

04:39.094 --> 04:42.094
(intruder groaning)

04:43.784 --> 04:45.723
(head cracks)

04:45.723 --> 04:48.640
(Victoria gasping)

04:55.765 --> 04:58.265
(eerie music)

05:09.080 --> 05:12.747
(Leonard breathing heavily)

05:19.220 --> 05:20.178
(injured man groaning and gasping)

05:20.178 --> 05:21.733
- [Intruder With Gun] Hurry. Quicker.

05:22.961 --> 05:25.646
- That thing in my face isn't helping.

05:25.646 --> 05:26.984
(injured man yelling)

05:26.984 --> 05:28.668
- [Intruder With Gun]
Quicker. Quicker, man.

05:28.668 --> 05:29.764
(injured man yelling)

05:29.764 --> 05:30.892
Stitch him up.

05:30.892 --> 05:32.606
(injured man groaning)

05:32.606 --> 05:33.636
Hurry up.

05:33.636 --> 05:37.636
(injured man breathing heavily)

05:41.551 --> 05:43.542
Five more minutes. We're almost done.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.042
We're almost done.

05:49.901 --> 05:51.523
- You're going to need
to change that dressing.

05:51.523 --> 05:53.232
(intruder with gun grunting)

05:53.232 --> 05:55.032
- [Intruder With Gun] Oh fuck. Fuck.

05:57.836 --> 05:59.366
- No!

05:59.366 --> 06:01.199
No, please, please no.

06:02.452 --> 06:03.971
(injured man grunting)

06:03.971 --> 06:05.333
(blood splatters)

06:05.333 --> 06:08.404
- [Benjamin] Mother, you all right?

06:08.404 --> 06:09.883
Victoria, are you all right?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.710
- She's okay. He's still in her room.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.070
- Get him out.

06:19.070 --> 06:22.283
I want that filthy body out of my house.

06:23.659 --> 06:25.205
(Victoria whimpering)

06:25.205 --> 06:27.538
- [Benjamin] It's all right.

06:31.346 --> 06:34.096
(shovel tapping)

06:37.339 --> 06:40.256
(deep scary music)

06:59.576 --> 07:03.140
(scissors clipping)

07:03.140 --> 07:04.460
- Hurry up, Leonard.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.373
The doctor wants to use
those herbs at full potency.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.470
Oh, and tell Dr. Benjamin
to come in for supper.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.893
I've made something very special.

07:16.657 --> 07:20.103
(slow somber music)

07:20.103 --> 07:21.936
- There you are, dear.

07:23.117 --> 07:23.950
All done.

07:29.031 --> 07:32.710
Now, remember to eat all your meat.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.079
Protein is important for you.

07:35.079 --> 07:38.079
(deep somber music)

07:41.402 --> 07:43.970
- Look, these are the new herbs.

07:43.970 --> 07:46.737
Mrs. Crumb said to come in for dinner.

07:47.874 --> 07:48.707
- Right.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.797
How have the reservations been, Mother?

07:55.797 --> 07:58.520
- [Irene] Wonderful. I just
love this time of year.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.787
We get so many visitors.

08:00.787 --> 08:04.231
- Dinner was delicious. Thank you.

08:04.231 --> 08:07.490
Leonard, excellent harvest this year.

08:07.490 --> 08:11.300
Your herbs are the highest
potency I've ever seen.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.500
I'm testing them now, and if
my suspicions are correct,

08:14.500 --> 08:17.140
it will produce a higher strength serum,

08:17.140 --> 08:21.503
which means lesser amounts
can be used to greater effect.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.943
- I am so proud of you Benjamin.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.850
And I'm proud of you too, Leonard.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.217
Oh, don't forget to empty
and clean those bins tonight.

08:34.217 --> 08:35.572
Yes?

08:35.572 --> 08:36.405
Thank you.

08:37.821 --> 08:41.305
(deep tense music)

08:41.305 --> 08:44.472
(Mrs. Smith giggling)

08:50.054 --> 08:50.920
- So much.
(Mrs. Smith laughing)

08:50.920 --> 08:53.270
- Good evening, um.

08:53.270 --> 08:54.590
Mr. and Mrs. uh-

08:54.590 --> 08:55.970
- Smith.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.883
- Uh yeah, that's us.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.330
- Please come in.

09:04.384 --> 09:06.051
- Where're we goin'?

09:08.792 --> 09:11.709
(deep eerie music)

09:35.406 --> 09:38.406
(Mr. Smith yelling)

09:48.690 --> 09:50.853
- Wow, it smells good.

09:53.274 --> 09:56.190
Have you uh, have you seen my uh, my guy?

09:58.089 --> 09:58.922
(bird chirping)

09:58.922 --> 10:00.530
Is that sausage?

10:00.530 --> 10:02.930
- Yes, it is, sausage and gravy.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.950
It's my own special recipe.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.460
Oh, oh please, sit.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.600
There's the table by the piano.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.950
Breakfast is important, you know.

10:10.950 --> 10:14.370
- Well uh, have you seen my guy?

10:14.370 --> 10:16.730
- Oh, he, he went for a walk with Leonard.

10:16.730 --> 10:19.593
I think they went to see the workshop.

10:20.540 --> 10:21.673
- Oh, great.

10:23.060 --> 10:24.423
Went to the workshop.

10:31.000 --> 10:31.833
Thank you.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.233
- When you finish, I'll take you there.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.623
(eerie music)

10:59.403 --> 11:02.320
(Mrs. Smith sighs)

11:03.889 --> 11:04.722
Oh my.

11:07.482 --> 11:12.482
(liquids gurgling)
(slow mysterious music)

12:49.799 --> 12:51.466
- Well, that's that.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.413
Now what about that girl?

12:55.360 --> 12:57.670
I want her tested for compatibility.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.210
- Resting quietly.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.080
But I already ran her toxic screens,

13:01.080 --> 13:03.722
and uh, she has opiates
and other street drugs

13:03.722 --> 13:04.600
in her system.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.023
- Mm, too bad.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.960
Well, it shouldn't be a total waste.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.250
How's the freezer, Mother, is it full?

13:13.250 --> 13:16.353
- Well, you can never have
enough for the winter months.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.810
Oh, but don't bother yourself,
dear. We'll take care of it.

13:20.810 --> 13:23.060
As soon as you've
finished, we'll have lunch.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.337
- All right.

13:26.337 --> 13:29.254
(liquids gurgling)

13:35.619 --> 13:39.036
(computer keys clicking)

13:40.346 --> 13:43.679
(slow mysterious music)

13:52.433 --> 13:55.370
- [Dispatcher] Sheriff, there's
a Mr. Angel Valente here.

13:55.370 --> 13:56.880
Says he's a private investigator

13:56.880 --> 13:58.513
looking for a missing person.

13:59.788 --> 14:02.705
(slow tense music)

14:04.720 --> 14:06.670
- Have him meet me out on the old road.

14:09.156 --> 14:12.073
(liquids gurgling)

14:20.076 --> 14:23.826
(Mrs. Smith yelling muffled)

14:34.614 --> 14:37.614
(slow somber music)

14:47.637 --> 14:48.506
(Mrs. Smith thuds)

14:48.506 --> 14:51.839
(Mrs. Smith whimpering)

14:56.724 --> 14:59.474
(stick thudding)

15:00.610 --> 15:03.943
(slow mysterious music)

15:14.436 --> 15:15.673
- We're going to town.

15:16.862 --> 15:19.605
- Mother, well, what about lunch?

15:19.605 --> 15:20.770
- Oh really, Benjamin.

15:20.770 --> 15:22.943
Surely you and Leonard can fix something.

15:27.696 --> 15:30.529
(door bangs shut)

15:33.173 --> 15:34.006
- Leonard.

15:35.650 --> 15:39.950
- [Leonard] Here you go,
Dr. B, just how you like it.

15:39.950 --> 15:41.763
- Nicely done, Leonard.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.940
I want you to know, I
think of you as a son.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.110
I hope you know that.

15:55.310 --> 15:57.923
- Dr. B, can I ask you a question?

16:00.190 --> 16:03.343
I've been with you folks for
as long as I can remember.

16:04.870 --> 16:07.313
My grandma and grandpa raised me here.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.663
I been eating this meat all my life.

16:14.870 --> 16:17.583
How did you folks come to eating flesh?

16:18.970 --> 16:19.803
- Hm.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.223
In times of great desperation,

16:24.660 --> 16:26.833
war, depression, famine,

16:28.356 --> 16:31.890
a man will do whatever
it takes to survive.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.863
The Great Depression, for
example, people were starving.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.703
We didn't.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.680
Frankly, it's a waste to bury those

16:41.680 --> 16:45.473
who've sacrificed their lives for science.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.323
Realizing they're rich in protein,

16:50.610 --> 16:55.277
Mother created a curing rub,
which, as you well know,

16:55.277 --> 16:57.423
has a wonderfully savory flavor.

17:01.740 --> 17:04.143
- So you recycle them. Makes sense.

17:05.110 --> 17:07.410
- The next town is 32 miles that way.

17:07.410 --> 17:08.700
We don't get too many visitors out here

17:08.700 --> 17:09.860
unless they're lost.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.230
There's no hotel, and the
only motel is the Lucky 8

17:12.230 --> 17:13.770
you saw as you entered town.

17:13.770 --> 17:15.500
Mostly truckers there.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.490
- Well, that's interesting
'cause Banesville area

17:17.490 --> 17:19.290
was the last reported sighting.

17:19.290 --> 17:20.300
- Oh.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.700
- There's no other area or a place

17:22.700 --> 17:24.320
where somebody could stay?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.740
- Not really.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.840
Well, there's the Crumbs' place,

17:26.840 --> 17:28.700
but it's one of those
bed and breakfast places.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.207
You have to make arrangements in advance.

17:30.207 --> 17:31.040
- Yeah.

17:31.040 --> 17:31.910
- Lovely people, the Crumbs.

17:31.910 --> 17:33.673
Been in the County as long
as anyone can remember.

17:33.673 --> 17:34.506
(Angel chuckles)

17:34.506 --> 17:35.339
If you care to talk to them,

17:35.339 --> 17:37.550
they're about a mile down
the road, can't miss it.

17:37.550 --> 17:39.130
- All right.

17:39.130 --> 17:40.570
Thanks, sheriff.
- You bet.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.900
Hey, you know, I'll ask
around the Lucky 8 for you.

17:42.900 --> 17:43.750
- [Angel] Thanks.

17:49.930 --> 17:53.097
(door bells jangling)

17:58.930 --> 18:00.403
- Well, good afternoon.

18:01.340 --> 18:02.994
Aren't you the cutest couple ever?

18:02.994 --> 18:06.285
- [Francisco] Good afternoon.
We are, miss, miss-

18:06.285 --> 18:09.720
- Forgive my husband, he
doesn't speak English very well.

18:09.720 --> 18:14.183
We are Mr. And Mrs.
Francisco Soliz. Newlyweds.

18:15.567 --> 18:17.013
Do you have our reservation?

18:22.380 --> 18:23.670
- Nothing to forgive.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.289
- Ah.
- Now, now, beautiful.

18:25.289 --> 18:28.563
Uh, uh, uh, uh, buenas tardes.

18:28.563 --> 18:29.396
- [Francisco] Oh.

18:29.396 --> 18:30.229
(Solizs laugh)

18:30.229 --> 18:32.179
- Please, please, come in, come in.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.340
- Gracis.
- Enter, por favor.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.273
- Oh, (chuckles) thank you.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.560
- I will be stepping out, but oh,

18:39.560 --> 18:42.320
I'm gonna leave you in
good hands, I assure you.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.680
Uh, Victoria and I have a few
errands to run in town, dear.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.583
- Very good, Mother.
- Mm.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.860
- Well, uh, through here I'll show you

18:52.860 --> 18:54.110
where your rooms will be.

18:57.599 --> 19:00.682
(singing in Spanish)

19:14.793 --> 19:18.728
(Francisco clears throat)

19:18.728 --> 19:22.478
(Francisco speaking Spanish)

19:26.900 --> 19:29.753
- I'm sorry. We wanted to
surprise you with a snack.

19:30.590 --> 19:34.367
- I love fresh salsa and guacamole.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.797
- What happened to the music?

19:35.797 --> 19:39.313
Ah, I thought something
had happened to our guests.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.923
- What can happen to us here? (chuckles)

19:45.410 --> 19:47.120
We'll be leaving early in the morning.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.100
We want to see the
sunrise from Mystery Rock.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.600
- [Irene] Be careful up there.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.633
- You guys are so
special. We will be back.

20:01.580 --> 20:05.716
- Well, lovely, thank you.

20:05.716 --> 20:06.549
(Francisco laughs)

20:06.549 --> 20:07.943
Mother, enjoy.

20:11.030 --> 20:12.920
- My husband would like
to cook something special

20:12.920 --> 20:13.773
for dinner.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.223
If you don't mind.

20:18.074 --> 20:22.263
- Uh, yes, yes. Why not?

20:25.520 --> 20:29.733
- That would be wonderful.

20:31.650 --> 20:32.993
- Yes, it would be.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.903
Mother, shall we retire to the other room?

20:40.710 --> 20:41.543
Please.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.826
(gentle guitar music)

20:53.660 --> 20:56.140
- We found a freshly
butchered piece of meat.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.600
It looked like pork.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.912
I hope you don't mind we used it.

20:58.912 --> 21:01.217
- Okay.
- Not at all.

21:01.217 --> 21:04.493
And yes, it is freshly butchered.

21:07.180 --> 21:09.210
Well, I don't see any beans.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.579
I thought you Mexicans always eat beans.

21:11.579 --> 21:13.453
- Father, that's offensive.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.023
- Oh? Well I didn't mean it like that.

21:19.219 --> 21:21.250
Well, the good thing is he
can't understand me anyway.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.480
Right?

21:22.480 --> 21:25.830
- Mm, perhaps we should do more eating

21:25.830 --> 21:29.203
and uh, less talking, Benjamin.

21:32.910 --> 21:35.620
- Now, what is this special dish?

21:35.620 --> 21:36.520
- Carnitas.
- Oh.

21:37.690 --> 21:39.247
- Yes, carnitas.

21:41.114 --> 21:41.947
- Huh. Hm.

21:47.432 --> 21:51.640
Leonard. When you're
finished come in for lunch.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.113
We're having the carnitas
the Solizs left for us.

22:00.811 --> 22:02.644
- Sorry to bother you.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.320
My car broke down on the road.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.363
I think that it overheated or
something. Can you help me?

22:14.710 --> 22:17.010
I was on my way to a photo shoot.

22:17.010 --> 22:17.843
I'm a model.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.910
I just must've taken a wrong turn.

22:20.910 --> 22:22.923
I can't seem to get any reception.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.903
- How 'bout a cold refreshment?

22:28.420 --> 22:29.980
- It is hot.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.623
How 'bout some lemonade, and
I'll take care of your car.

22:33.634 --> 22:36.301
(keys jingling)

22:45.290 --> 22:46.520
- Have you lived here long?

22:46.520 --> 22:47.573
- Since a girl.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.683
I was raised on this property.

22:51.740 --> 22:54.150
- I guess you like living
out in the middle of nowhere.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.373
- It's our home. That is somewhere.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.190
- Oh my gosh. This is so good.

23:04.190 --> 23:08.890
- Well, well, well, who
is our new friend here?

23:08.890 --> 23:10.630
- I'm Ricki, with an I.

23:10.630 --> 23:13.730
My car broke down and your
boy's trying to fix it.

23:13.730 --> 23:17.340
- Oh, well, my boy's name is Leonard.

23:17.340 --> 23:21.083
And I am Dr. Benjamin, Ricki with an I.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.823
And uh, I think I'll go
take a look at your car.

23:29.530 --> 23:33.686
- Well, to unexpected car breakdowns.

23:33.686 --> 23:37.386
- Right?
(both laughing)

23:37.386 --> 23:40.136
(birds chirping)

23:49.093 --> 23:52.250
- (yawns) Could really use a nap.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.760
- Not a problem, dear.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.460
You can nap upstairs while
Leonard retrieves your car.

23:58.293 --> 24:00.526
(Ricki sighs)

24:00.526 --> 24:03.026
(eerie music)

24:06.480 --> 24:07.313
- She's perfect.

24:09.023 --> 24:09.856
- Perfect.

24:11.526 --> 24:13.776
- I'll have Leonard take
her to the workshop.

24:19.669 --> 24:23.220
(liquids gurgling)

24:23.220 --> 24:24.837
This is a fortuitous day.

24:27.930 --> 24:32.930
Be extracting hormones,
pineal, pituitary glands.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.956
(slow tense music)

24:45.509 --> 24:47.092
Ah, that's better.

24:50.190 --> 24:51.613
Shall we begin?

24:52.638 --> 24:55.805
(slow haunting music)

25:08.785 --> 25:11.618
(fluids slurping)

25:12.902 --> 25:15.735
(Ricki screaming)

25:27.956 --> 25:30.956
(telephone ringing)

25:38.940 --> 25:40.693
Is no one going to get that?

25:42.285 --> 25:45.035
(Benjamin sighs)

25:47.540 --> 25:49.913
Dr. Benjamin Crumb
speaking. Can I help you?

25:51.349 --> 25:54.260
(slow somber music)

25:54.260 --> 25:55.093
I see.

25:57.770 --> 25:58.623
I understand.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.083
No problem.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.950
Thank you for your concern.

26:05.119 --> 26:08.036
(slow scary music)

26:31.750 --> 26:34.593
- This is Dr. Benjamin. Why
don't you show him the photo?

26:38.203 --> 26:40.140
- Too bad, looks like a nice guy.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.000
How long has he been missing?

26:41.000 --> 26:41.833
- Little while.

26:44.590 --> 26:48.787
- As you probably know, all of
our guests make reservations.

26:48.787 --> 26:51.683
- How 'bout you? You seen this man?

26:52.750 --> 26:54.123
Perhaps in town?

26:56.860 --> 27:00.273
Okay (laughs), I'll take that as a no.

27:02.674 --> 27:05.130
- Here you are, please take this.

27:05.130 --> 27:07.183
I season and age the meat myself.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.363
I hope you find that poor man.
His wife must be miserable.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.850
- Sheriff Martin says you're
the best cook in the county.

27:15.850 --> 27:17.420
Thanks.

27:17.420 --> 27:18.253
- Thanks, folks.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.459
(eerie music)

27:26.191 --> 27:29.259
- Remember to empty those bins tonight.

27:29.259 --> 27:32.342
(objects clattering)

27:33.358 --> 27:36.025
(curious music)

27:50.520 --> 27:52.523
- What? What did you find?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.720
Let's see.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.887
(light curious music)

28:13.049 --> 28:15.353
(laughs) Do you like them?

28:18.900 --> 28:19.733
What else?

28:21.119 --> 28:24.286
(light curious music)

28:36.697 --> 28:38.923
I'll wear them for you tonight.

28:43.980 --> 28:46.030
- I laid out your favorite dress for you.

28:48.850 --> 28:49.827
Let me help you.

28:56.870 --> 28:59.803
You have such beautiful skin.

29:01.090 --> 29:03.223
You began the serum at the right time,

29:04.150 --> 29:06.723
when your skin was still young and smooth.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.910
Hopefully you have many
more years remaining young

29:12.910 --> 29:13.743
and beautiful.

29:19.930 --> 29:23.373
- Do you like Leonard mother? For me?

29:26.780 --> 29:29.773
- He loves you. He will take care of you.

29:32.860 --> 29:33.693
- Yes.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.970
I love you, Mother.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.660
- They may have come through here.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.890
The Lucky 8 is where they would land.

29:41.890 --> 29:42.723
How long you been looking?

29:42.723 --> 29:44.690
- A while.

29:44.690 --> 29:45.770
- Where are they from?

29:45.770 --> 29:46.890
- Sacramento.

29:46.890 --> 29:49.543
- Sacramento. Bit of a distance.

29:50.430 --> 29:51.430
You from there?

29:51.430 --> 29:52.263
- Close by.

29:54.550 --> 29:56.430
Hey look sheriff, I'd really appreciate it

29:56.430 --> 29:58.160
if you could keep an eye out.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.150
- I sure will.

29:59.150 --> 30:01.390
You know, I, I hate to
hear this sort of thing.

30:01.390 --> 30:02.800
Do you have a card or a
way I can reach to you

30:02.800 --> 30:04.030
in case I hear something?

30:04.030 --> 30:05.470
- I left my number with your dispatcher.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.780
She knows how to get ahold of me.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.018
- Alrighty then.

30:08.018 --> 30:09.983
Then I suppose there
isn't much more I can do.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.370
- Thanks, sheriff.
- Absolutely.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.020
- Appreciate your help.
- Yeah.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.600
I'll keep you posted if anything comes up,

30:15.600 --> 30:17.730
and I'd appreciate it if you did the same.

30:17.730 --> 30:20.965
Like I said, I hate hearing
of this sort of thing too.

30:20.965 --> 30:21.798
- Sheriff.

30:24.850 --> 30:25.683
- [Martin] Hey.

30:31.535 --> 30:34.210
- I don't mean to interrupt.

30:34.210 --> 30:35.603
Kinda lost it back there.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.603
- Yeah. I can see that.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.302
- I don't have anything
big enough to loosen it up.

30:47.260 --> 30:51.950
- Leonard, why don't we help
this gentleman fix his bike.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.852
Just follow Leonard.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.352
(eerie music)

31:13.860 --> 31:14.693
Mother.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.700
We have a new guest.

31:19.684 --> 31:22.223
A strapping young mountain biker.

31:23.282 --> 31:27.645
- Really? I don't recall any reservations.

31:27.645 --> 31:29.253
- No, he doesn't have one.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.990
- [Irene] Where is Leonard?

31:31.990 --> 31:35.642
- Round back helping
the man fix his bicycle.

31:35.642 --> 31:40.473
- (sighs) These newfangled
things confuse me so.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.200
I loved that outfit.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.320
- Perfect.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.153
- Hm.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.720
Oh, we can do better than that.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.433
Victoria, please bring
our guest some lemonade.

32:03.335 --> 32:05.650
(eerie music)

32:05.650 --> 32:06.560
- Here you are.

32:08.111 --> 32:10.611
(eerie music)

32:13.980 --> 32:16.603
Do you like it?

32:20.790 --> 32:21.640
- It's very good.

32:23.010 --> 32:25.060
- The road leads straight back into town.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.190
- Why don't you join Victoria
and I for a late lunch?

32:30.190 --> 32:31.023
We have plenty.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.660
- I'm Michael.

32:36.660 --> 32:39.910
(tense haunting music)

32:57.502 --> 33:00.002
(air hissing)

33:08.590 --> 33:09.423
Damn.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.303
Must've been a slow leak.

33:15.230 --> 33:16.783
Looks like I'm staying a while.

33:23.250 --> 33:28.250
- My family owns several
hundred acres, mostly woods.

33:34.653 --> 33:36.323
- (sighs) I thought.

33:37.530 --> 33:39.103
- I, I'm not angry, I just,

33:41.670 --> 33:43.363
I've never been kissed.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.563
I mean, by anyone other
than my parents, or Leonard.

33:49.910 --> 33:51.478
- Leonard?

33:51.478 --> 33:54.728
(tense haunting music)

34:00.190 --> 34:02.473
- We need to get back.
He'll be looking for me.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.060
- Did you two have a nice walk?

34:14.490 --> 34:17.770
- We did. I showed him the woods.

34:17.770 --> 34:19.430
- That's nice.

34:19.430 --> 34:21.450
You can stay the night
and leave in the morning.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.423
Leonard can take your tire into town.

34:24.570 --> 34:28.141
- No need. Uh, I have a spare tube.

34:28.141 --> 34:33.141
So uh, but yeah, I can uh, get
a fresh start in the morning.

34:34.830 --> 34:36.870
- Your room is at the top of the stairs.

34:36.870 --> 34:39.520
Clean towels are in the
shower if you wanna clean up.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.323
What's wrong?

34:49.348 --> 34:52.770
- He might've taken a
picture he shouldn't have.

34:52.770 --> 34:53.603
- Oh dear.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.093
Get his phone.

34:57.020 --> 34:57.853
- I'll handle it.

34:57.853 --> 35:00.423
- No, I will.

35:02.876 --> 35:07.876
(water splattering)
(deep tense music)

35:28.160 --> 35:29.910
- What are you doing with my phone?

35:34.067 --> 35:36.734
(Michael thuds)

35:37.570 --> 35:41.387
- Don't fret, dear. It's
all going to be over soon.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.489
- Thank you, Father.

35:46.489 --> 35:49.822
(deep mysterious music)

35:57.510 --> 35:58.343
- You should've left.

35:58.343 --> 36:01.903
(Michael grunting)

36:01.903 --> 36:04.403
(saw buzzing)

36:18.521 --> 36:21.938
(slow suspenseful music)

36:32.333 --> 36:35.250
(doorbell ringing)

36:37.193 --> 36:40.026
(kids chattering)

36:46.750 --> 36:49.023
- Hey, we're only a few
minutes up the road.

36:50.393 --> 36:51.560
- [Lens] Whew.

36:53.830 --> 36:55.933
It's so green here. It's great.

36:57.580 --> 36:58.830
- [Woman In Car] Well, it better be nice.

36:58.830 --> 36:59.960
There's people there?

36:59.960 --> 37:02.963
- Oh, keep complaining.
I showed you a picture.

37:04.410 --> 37:06.193
We are at the front of the house.

37:07.490 --> 37:10.847
Not exactly what one would
expect when described as,

37:10.847 --> 37:13.430
"the cottage in the woods."

37:13.430 --> 37:15.643
Although, it certainly is in the woods.

37:16.620 --> 37:21.313
Uh, at this time, there
are no life forms present.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.033
But wait.

37:24.860 --> 37:27.133
We have, wow.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.073
- Hello.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.300
- Hello.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.570
- [Victoria] Do you have a reservation?

37:38.570 --> 37:40.653
- [Spencer] Yeah, we've,
we've got reservations.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.503
- Victoria, are these our new guests?

37:45.580 --> 37:47.180
- Victoria?

37:47.180 --> 37:48.013
- Yes?

37:49.830 --> 37:52.884
- Oh, I'm sorry, I was, I
was just repeating your name.

37:52.884 --> 37:55.253
That's how I memorize someone's
name I don't wanna forget.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.260
- Well then, what are your names?

37:59.260 --> 38:00.660
- Well, I'm Spencer.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.280
That's Kat, Lens, and Sandy.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.480
- I'm Irene, and I hope you like tamales.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.963
I have a wonderful recipe
a guest shared with me.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.883
Well, bring your things and come inside.

38:22.032 --> 38:26.380
- Wow.

38:26.380 --> 38:27.213
Whoa.

38:33.590 --> 38:35.242
So many birds.

38:35.242 --> 38:36.075
Oh!

38:37.360 --> 38:40.653
- [Irene] Leonard,
Benjamin, our new guests.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.730
- What's the wifi password?

38:49.730 --> 38:50.830
- [Victoria] Why what?

38:51.750 --> 38:54.750
- Really? The wifi?

38:54.750 --> 38:55.873
You know the internet?

38:57.780 --> 39:01.560
- Sure, the internet.
We don't get it here.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.180
- Uh. Where the hell are we?

39:04.180 --> 39:06.723
No internet? Shit.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.850
- Mother, why don't we have the internet?

39:15.850 --> 39:16.860
- Why?

39:16.860 --> 39:20.370
- I'm just wondering why we
don't have it. That's all.

39:20.370 --> 39:22.060
- Well, we don't need it.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.110
- Why? What's wrong with the internet?

39:25.110 --> 39:29.250
- Well, nothing, it's just uh, not for us.

39:29.250 --> 39:31.480
- Why not? Why don't
you want me to have it?

39:31.480 --> 39:33.533
- You don't need it.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.830
- What don't you want me to find out?

39:37.830 --> 39:40.173
- There is nothing there for you.

39:41.869 --> 39:44.619
(Victoria sighs)

39:46.294 --> 39:49.770
(water splashes)

39:49.770 --> 39:51.380
- All right, here we are with the big guy

39:51.380 --> 39:53.660
in his natural environment.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.530
Hey. Hey, big guy.

39:55.530 --> 39:58.708
Uh, how do you know the
difference between these herbs?

39:58.708 --> 40:01.152
- I just know.

40:01.152 --> 40:02.290
- Just know?

40:02.290 --> 40:03.123
- That's all.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.280
- That's good, yeah. Keep it going.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.113
- That's it.

40:08.250 --> 40:11.273
- We went walking. I was
just showing him around.

40:13.090 --> 40:15.543
- Yeah, we were just
like walking over there.

40:16.729 --> 40:19.229
(tense music)

40:24.876 --> 40:25.709
- What the foe was that all about?

40:25.709 --> 40:27.500
- It, it's all right.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.333
- Uh.

40:34.741 --> 40:36.710
(Leonard breathing heavily)

40:36.710 --> 40:38.160
- They need to leave now!

40:38.160 --> 40:40.653
- Whoa, Leonard.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.665
- I want them gone.

40:45.665 --> 40:49.177
I, (panting) I want to-

40:49.177 --> 40:50.587
- I understand.

40:50.587 --> 40:51.550
(Leonard breathing heavily)

40:51.550 --> 40:52.843
Spencer, isn't it?

40:54.206 --> 40:56.210
But they are our guests.

40:56.210 --> 41:00.373
They have reservations. You know this.

41:01.233 --> 41:05.617
Listen. They will be gone soon enough.

41:06.970 --> 41:08.073
Be patient.

41:09.660 --> 41:10.823
Be patient.

41:16.051 --> 41:17.950
(Leonard exhales deeply)

41:17.950 --> 41:21.033
(tense somber music)

41:27.378 --> 41:30.567
(Benjamin sighs)

41:30.567 --> 41:34.259
(insects buzzing)
(swing creaking)

41:34.259 --> 41:36.140
- You think the doc would
let me interview him?

41:36.140 --> 41:37.390
- [Sandy] Why?

41:37.390 --> 41:38.530
- 'Cause he's totally cool.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.113
I mean, look at this place.

41:42.110 --> 41:44.880
Yeah hey, Dr. B, what do you say?

41:44.880 --> 41:46.180
How 'bout I interview you?

41:47.180 --> 41:49.363
- No, I don't think so.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.490
I'm not that interesting.

41:52.437 --> 41:54.040
- (sighs) Already tried the big guy,

41:54.040 --> 41:55.903
but his vocabulary is rather limited.

41:58.270 --> 42:00.203
Uh, no offense.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.520
- Chill, Lens. No need to burn him.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.973
- Well kids, till morning then.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.213
Victoria, shall we say goodnight?

42:13.621 --> 42:16.538
(deep tense music)

42:46.760 --> 42:48.390
- Okay, this place is totally weird.

42:48.390 --> 42:50.290
What's up with the creepy doll?

42:50.290 --> 42:51.730
- Dude, who cares?

42:51.730 --> 42:53.530
Victoria is flaming hot.

42:53.530 --> 42:54.770
- What?

42:54.770 --> 42:56.290
- Bet she can't dance.

42:56.290 --> 42:57.655
(Lens laughs)

42:57.655 --> 42:59.646
I'm just sayin'.

42:59.646 --> 43:02.720
- I bet she can do the horizontal mambo.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.553
- Behavior.

43:03.553 --> 43:04.834
- Just saying.

43:04.834 --> 43:06.500
- Is that all you're thinking of?

43:06.500 --> 43:07.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:08.930 --> 43:10.170
- What's weird for me is they act like

43:10.170 --> 43:11.870
they're from the 1800s.

43:11.870 --> 43:13.720
The doctor with his fob.

43:13.720 --> 43:16.220
Victoria, the way she dresses.

43:16.220 --> 43:17.063
- I'm tired.

43:19.100 --> 43:22.797
Let's just leave early and
have breakfast somewhere else.

43:22.797 --> 43:25.094
I got diarrhea from that meat.

43:25.094 --> 43:26.940
- Ew. What happened to you?

43:26.940 --> 43:29.174
(Lens imitates farting)

43:29.174 --> 43:34.174
(kids laughing)
(eerie music)

43:35.790 --> 43:38.707
(insects chirping)

43:40.947 --> 43:43.270
(Kat clears throat)

43:43.270 --> 43:44.895
- There's two of us here.

43:44.895 --> 43:46.318
(Sandy coughs)

43:46.318 --> 43:48.090
Serves you right for being greedy.

43:48.090 --> 43:49.480
- Who's there?

43:49.480 --> 43:53.290
Oh, cool. You want some?

43:53.290 --> 43:54.253
- What is it?

43:55.270 --> 43:56.103
- It's pot.

43:57.730 --> 43:59.380
What? Afraid you'll get addicted?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.063
- Nevermind her.

44:02.910 --> 44:03.743
It's okay.

44:06.030 --> 44:08.790
How long have you lived here?

44:08.790 --> 44:11.153
- All my life. I grew up here.

44:12.329 --> 44:14.792
- Are you sure you don't want a hit?

44:14.792 --> 44:17.292
(tense music)

44:24.911 --> 44:26.198
(Victoria coughing)

44:26.198 --> 44:29.074
- (laughs) Whoa, did you
see that? That was huge.

44:29.074 --> 44:31.491
(Kat laughs)

44:35.220 --> 44:38.250
- So what's up with
the Mystery Rock stuff?

44:38.250 --> 44:39.820
- I mean, haven't people
disappear up there?

44:39.820 --> 44:41.270
- Uh, I, I don't know.

44:41.270 --> 44:42.963
- That's a legend, Sandy.

44:43.820 --> 44:44.653
Right?

44:44.653 --> 44:45.800
- I've never been there.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.300
I've heard stories of
people who have disappeared.

44:49.672 --> 44:51.993
- Ooh, sounds creepy.

44:52.879 --> 44:54.040
(Sandy laughs)

44:54.040 --> 44:55.071
- Is this a private party?

44:55.071 --> 44:58.080
- Oh my god, Spencer. You
scared the crap outta me.

44:58.080 --> 44:58.913
- Cool.

45:00.970 --> 45:02.420
I have a question to ask you.

45:03.504 --> 45:04.337
What are you doing all the way out here

45:04.337 --> 45:06.720
in the middle of nowhere?

45:06.720 --> 45:08.280
There's like, nothing to do.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.083
There's no dancing. There's no music.

45:12.120 --> 45:12.993
You like EDM?

45:14.120 --> 45:17.493
You know, Calvin Harris, Timmy Trumpet.

45:20.169 --> 45:24.203
- [Victoria] I'm really not
sure what kind of music I like.

45:24.203 --> 45:25.036
- Okay.

45:27.253 --> 45:30.583
What about guys? What kinda guys you like?

45:31.600 --> 45:32.650
- My kind.

45:32.650 --> 45:34.053
- Whoa, man. Chill.

45:35.080 --> 45:35.913
- Victoria.

45:37.740 --> 45:38.893
You're smoking pot?

45:41.120 --> 45:43.770
If your mother were to see you like this,

45:43.770 --> 45:46.260
she'd be very upset.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.283
You should go home.

45:55.450 --> 45:58.540
You're leaving in the morning, right?

45:58.540 --> 45:59.940
- Yeah?

45:59.940 --> 46:02.713
- You're leaving in the morning. Right?

46:09.295 --> 46:10.450
- [Kat] He creeps me out.

46:10.450 --> 46:12.510
- [Sandy] Do you see
the way he looks at her.

46:12.510 --> 46:14.773
- Yeah, yeah. Give me the damn pen.

46:16.864 --> 46:19.781
(Spencer inhaling)

46:22.539 --> 46:25.227
(Spencer exhales)

46:25.227 --> 46:28.144
(insects chirping)

46:37.485 --> 46:40.760
- Had a feeling I'd find you out here.

46:40.760 --> 46:41.633
Watching him.

46:44.730 --> 46:46.227
I know how you feel.

46:48.860 --> 46:50.613
You cannot kill him.

46:52.281 --> 46:57.190
In all our years yet, we
have never harmed a guest

46:57.190 --> 46:58.567
with reservations.

47:02.046 --> 47:02.963
Am I clear?

47:04.476 --> 47:07.393
(insects chirping)

47:18.340 --> 47:20.083
- We are in the Crumbs' backyard.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.620
To my rear are the woods.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.723
Ooh, spooky.

47:26.610 --> 47:29.260
The yard runs right up
to the edge of the woods.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.380
At night you can almost hear the Wolfman

47:31.380 --> 47:34.645
howling at the moon. (howling)

47:34.645 --> 47:37.312
(Lens laughing)

47:39.630 --> 47:40.880
Over here's the workshop.

47:42.240 --> 47:45.293
Dr. Benjamin's got his
laboratory in there.

47:48.420 --> 47:50.420
Wonder what kind of experiments he does?

47:53.280 --> 47:54.630
Let's see if we can get in.

47:55.924 --> 47:58.674
(birds chirping)

48:14.366 --> 48:15.199
- Can I help you?

48:15.199 --> 48:16.851
- Just, shit!

48:16.851 --> 48:19.680
(gasps) I didn't see you walk up.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.173
- You wanna see my lab?

48:23.600 --> 48:26.160
- Yeah, yeah, (stammering) sure.

48:26.160 --> 48:26.993
Very cool.

48:27.827 --> 48:30.577
(birds chirping)

48:34.970 --> 48:36.393
- I'll get the lights.

48:42.070 --> 48:43.243
Don't touch anything.

48:47.048 --> 48:49.965
(liquids gurgling)

48:51.481 --> 48:54.231
- Ooh, it's cold as shit in here.

48:56.150 --> 49:01.150
- Well, this is where I
conduct my medical research.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.870
I am studying the causes and effects

49:03.870 --> 49:06.830
of human cellular degeneration,

49:06.830 --> 49:11.830
and the effects of certain
natural substances on processes.

49:14.371 --> 49:16.923
- You mean like, stopping
the aging process?

49:17.840 --> 49:18.673
- Precisely.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.633
- Wow.

49:22.230 --> 49:23.923
Uh, how, how's it all work?

49:25.880 --> 49:30.880
- I have created a serum that
coats the cells in a substance

49:31.140 --> 49:34.403
that prevents carcinogens
from destroying cell tissue,

49:35.400 --> 49:38.150
thus preventing cellular degeneration

49:38.150 --> 49:41.560
that causes aging, disease,

49:41.560 --> 49:43.873
and it makes the cell growth stronger.

49:45.970 --> 49:46.970
- Fountain of youth.

49:48.300 --> 49:50.880
- It doesn't reverse the aging process,

49:50.880 --> 49:54.170
but it arrests where it is.

49:54.170 --> 49:57.173
So that if you started taking
it when you were eight,

49:58.200 --> 50:00.803
you would always appear to be eight,

50:01.810 --> 50:05.773
but you would feel younger,
and you would never get ill.

50:07.090 --> 50:11.000
- So, so if I took it
now, I'd stay like this.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.488
And I wouldn't get sick.
I'd look like this forever.

50:13.488 --> 50:14.853
(gasps) Unreal.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.827
Excuse me for saying, but
that is totally fucking cool.

50:18.827 --> 50:19.823
Can I try it?

50:21.610 --> 50:25.503
- Mrs. Crumb needs to speak with you.

50:27.480 --> 50:31.510
- Ah. Well, Lens here was
just asking about the serum.

50:31.510 --> 50:35.590
- I was totally just blown
away, dude. (imitates explosion)

50:35.590 --> 50:37.590
- I can prep him if you like.

50:37.590 --> 50:40.260
- No, that, that won't be necessary.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.460
- Yeah, prep me.

50:41.460 --> 50:43.882
- No, I think it's better for you

50:43.882 --> 50:46.123
if you get back with your friends now.

50:47.135 --> 50:50.052
(liquids gurgling)

51:03.110 --> 51:05.400
- It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.930
Oh, and uh, I prepared some
prime cuts for you to share.

51:08.930 --> 51:10.130
- Oh, thanks.

51:10.130 --> 51:12.717
You know, aside from the
wifi, it's been pretty cool.

51:12.717 --> 51:14.900
- Yeah, the shits only lasted one day.

51:14.900 --> 51:16.150
- Oh, shits and giggles.

51:16.150 --> 51:17.750
Who could ask for anything more?

51:18.620 --> 51:20.200
- Hey, I was gonna ask you.

51:20.200 --> 51:23.410
Do you have like maybe
a phone or an email or-

51:23.410 --> 51:26.760
- I recommend you get gas
before you leave town.

51:26.760 --> 51:29.937
- Okay. Okay, well, it
was nice to meet you.

51:31.822 --> 51:32.655
See ya.

51:34.336 --> 51:37.241
(birds chirping)

51:37.241 --> 51:39.991
(engine revving)

51:46.802 --> 51:51.802
- [Lens] See you later, Dr. B.

51:57.460 --> 51:58.607
- I don't like them.

52:00.460 --> 52:02.963
- What a pity they had a reservation.

52:06.410 --> 52:07.243
- I don't know, he better-
- I don't know,

52:07.243 --> 52:08.940
but he needs to hurry
up because I'm starving.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.630
- [Kat] Well I hope he's
gonna get some zebra cake.

52:10.630 --> 52:13.880
- I wanna get a burrito bowl.
- He'll bring something.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.713
- Well, that's-

52:14.713 --> 52:15.620
- Hi.
- Really amazing to say that.

52:15.620 --> 52:16.670
- Hi back.

52:16.670 --> 52:18.250
- Are you from here?

52:18.250 --> 52:19.083
- Why?

52:20.050 --> 52:23.830
- I'm looking for a place. A cottage?

52:23.830 --> 52:25.150
- Oh, you mean the Crumbs' place?

52:25.150 --> 52:27.003
It's down the road a couple miles.

52:28.780 --> 52:30.822
Oh my god. It's about time.

52:30.822 --> 52:31.930
(bags crinkling)

52:31.930 --> 52:33.730
Okay, I'll take these.
- Thank you.

52:34.741 --> 52:35.574
- Bye.

52:39.603 --> 52:41.443
Did you see how hot he was?

52:42.608 --> 52:43.782
(kids talking quietly)

52:43.782 --> 52:47.532
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

53:06.946 --> 53:07.779
- Is this the cottage?

53:07.779 --> 53:09.543
- Yes. Do you have a reservation?

53:10.510 --> 53:12.460
- No, I got the address off of a flyer.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.850
- Are you looking for a room?

53:16.970 --> 53:18.470
- Just for tonight.

53:18.470 --> 53:19.763
- Please, come in.

53:21.430 --> 53:23.230
- [Victoria] I like your motorcycle.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.960
- Your room will be the first
at the top of the stairs.

53:39.960 --> 53:43.940
And uh, you are free to use
the facilities if you like.

53:43.940 --> 53:46.430
Or you could always eat with us.

53:46.430 --> 53:47.730
- By the way, I'm Cameron.

53:48.590 --> 53:52.820
- I'm Irene and (giggles) there's
Dr. Benjamin, and Leonard.

53:52.820 --> 53:54.213
And-
- I'm Victoria.

53:56.470 --> 53:57.303
- Thanks.

54:00.421 --> 54:01.254
This is good.

54:02.290 --> 54:03.190
Can I pay you now?

54:04.130 --> 54:06.050
You know, just in case I
don't get another chance.

54:06.050 --> 54:07.900
- Okay, um, that, that's 60.

54:07.900 --> 54:08.890
- 60.

54:08.890 --> 54:11.220
- Leonard, could you please get the key.

54:11.220 --> 54:13.783
And your motorcycle is
fine right where it is.

54:18.940 --> 54:22.010
- [Victoria] Excuse me, Father,
have you seen our new guest?

54:22.010 --> 54:23.750
- Oh, Cameron? No.

54:23.750 --> 54:25.620
Isn't he in his room?

54:25.620 --> 54:26.633
- I don't know.

54:27.820 --> 54:29.270
- Mother!

54:29.270 --> 54:31.993
- Oh dear god, Benjamin,
you don't have to shout.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.623
- Have you seen the boy?

54:37.329 --> 54:38.553
- He's not in his room?

54:39.680 --> 54:41.923
Victoria, go and knock
on his door, please.

54:46.740 --> 54:48.530
- Reading a very interesting chapter here

54:48.530 --> 54:50.760
about California horse ranching.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.820
This would have been excellent
information to have had

54:52.820 --> 54:54.467
about 25 years ago.

54:56.586 --> 54:57.814
(loud thudding)

54:57.814 --> 54:59.750
- [Victoria] Oh no, Father!

54:59.750 --> 55:01.833
- [Irene] Oh, what is it?

55:05.140 --> 55:06.040
- He's overdosing.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.360
Heartbeat's still strong.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.570
I'll need you to induce vomiting.

55:10.570 --> 55:12.173
Let's get him to the workshop.

55:13.920 --> 55:17.420
(tense suspenseful music)

55:32.683 --> 55:33.600
Get him up.

55:34.790 --> 55:35.623
Come on.

55:36.691 --> 55:40.191
(tense suspenseful music)

55:42.134 --> 55:46.829
All right. Go ahead and
swallow it, swallow it.

55:46.829 --> 55:47.662
(Cameron groans)

55:47.662 --> 55:49.150
Good.

55:49.150 --> 55:52.650
(tense suspenseful music)

55:56.682 --> 55:59.599
(Cameron retching)

56:04.257 --> 56:05.674
You're all right.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.553
You'll make it.

56:08.725 --> 56:12.142
(deep suspenseful music)

56:18.870 --> 56:21.640
Mother, I'd appreciate
if could repair a seam

56:21.640 --> 56:24.060
in the trousers of my brown suit.

56:24.060 --> 56:26.457
- I don't have time today.
I'll take it into the tailor.

56:26.457 --> 56:30.124
(motorcycle engine revving)

56:41.902 --> 56:44.485
- Well, that was disappointing.

56:45.327 --> 56:47.043
He was a healthy specimen.

56:51.991 --> 56:54.493
- (sighs) My, my, my, my, my.

56:55.673 --> 56:58.995
- Oh, don't worry, Mother.
I'm sure everything is fine.

56:58.995 --> 57:00.320
- They're probably lost.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.320
- Well I hope they didn't get cold feet.

57:04.971 --> 57:06.804
- Are you bored, dear?

57:09.048 --> 57:09.881
Me too.

57:13.082 --> 57:16.663
But, you are looking much better.

57:18.238 --> 57:19.388
Are you feeling better?

57:22.057 --> 57:25.285
There's my girl.

57:25.285 --> 57:28.618
(slow mysterious music)

57:37.776 --> 57:39.359
Excuse me, Leonard.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.360
- [Mr. Kline] Jennifer, what
the hell are gettin' us into?

57:50.360 --> 57:52.490
- The ad said they're
just simple country folk.

57:52.490 --> 57:54.206
- Simple country folk?

57:54.206 --> 57:57.357
Look at 'em. They're frickin' hicks.

57:57.357 --> 57:59.883
- Hi, you must be the Klines.

57:59.883 --> 58:00.910
- We are.

58:00.910 --> 58:03.170
- [Jennifer] We made a couple
of stops. I bought some dates.

58:03.170 --> 58:04.019
Do love dates?

58:04.019 --> 58:05.132
- Uh, you need to excuse her-
- I just love them.

58:05.132 --> 58:06.600
- She's a little bit of a talker.

58:06.600 --> 58:08.460
- I think she's just excited.

58:08.460 --> 58:09.340
I hope you're hungry.

58:09.340 --> 58:11.760
I made something special
for you to snack on.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.750
Leonard, could you please take
their bags into their rooms?

58:14.750 --> 58:16.950
And when you're done,
please park their car.

58:25.810 --> 58:27.203
- Good evening.
- Hello.

58:27.203 --> 58:29.010
- I'm Dr. Benjamin Crumb.

58:29.010 --> 58:31.470
- Nice to meet you.

58:31.470 --> 58:33.144
- You're a tall drink
of water, aren't you?

58:33.144 --> 58:36.061
(Jennifer giggles)

58:37.980 --> 58:41.133
- Neurosurgeon? Way out here?

58:42.580 --> 58:43.693
I don't get it.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.030
- Dinner, Ms. Crumb, was fantastic.

58:48.030 --> 58:49.090
I wish I could cook like you.

58:49.090 --> 58:53.157
- Huh, me too. She has
trouble boiling eggs.

58:53.157 --> 58:57.757
- Thank you, dear, very
kind of you to say.

59:06.613 --> 59:07.993
- Let's play a game.

59:12.920 --> 59:13.753
Charades.

59:15.465 --> 59:16.298
- Huh?

59:18.650 --> 59:20.303
- Okay, I'll go first.

59:25.108 --> 59:27.941
(seductive music)

59:32.183 --> 59:33.423
- Naughty girl?

59:34.651 --> 59:37.484
(seductive music)

59:40.260 --> 59:41.093
A stripper, huh?

59:42.200 --> 59:43.832
- No.

59:43.832 --> 59:46.220
(seductive music)

59:46.220 --> 59:48.380
- A prostitute?

59:48.380 --> 59:49.213
- No.

59:50.550 --> 59:52.900
- I think we need to tone
it down a little bit.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.890
- An exotic dancer?
- Yes.

59:56.890 --> 59:59.923
An exotic dancer. Come dance with me.

1:00:01.010 --> 1:00:02.530
- I can't dance.

1:00:02.530 --> 1:00:04.157
- I don't think this is actually really-

1:00:04.157 --> 1:00:05.700
- Sure you can dance.

1:00:05.700 --> 1:00:07.220
If you can move, you can dance.

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:08.220
Come, I'll show you.

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:12.830
Ready?

1:00:12.830 --> 1:00:13.663
- [Victoria] Mm-hmm.

1:00:13.663 --> 1:00:14.513
- Arms, shoulders.

1:00:16.390 --> 1:00:18.890
There you go. It's fun, right?

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:22.180
Good job.

1:00:22.180 --> 1:00:23.550
All right. You ready?

1:00:23.550 --> 1:00:25.500
You wanna try something fun? You ready?

1:00:26.345 --> 1:00:27.845
Okay, let's do it.

1:00:29.495 --> 1:00:30.328
(Jennifer gasps)

1:00:30.328 --> 1:00:31.603
- What the hell, Jennifer?
- Oh no, I'm so sorry.

1:00:31.603 --> 1:00:34.560
Oh my god, I'm so, so sorry.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:35.643
- [Mr. Kline] I think we've had enough.

1:00:36.788 --> 1:00:39.123
- You know what, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kline,

1:00:40.390 --> 1:00:43.800
this has been interesting, but,

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:45.200
you know how to find your rooms.

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:47.060
- I, I didn't mean to do that.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:47.893
- Goodnight.

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:55.510
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

1:00:59.967 --> 1:01:02.217
- We're gettin' outta here.

1:01:07.094 --> 1:01:09.594
(Irene sighs)

1:01:14.436 --> 1:01:17.103
(water rushing)

1:01:29.866 --> 1:01:32.366
(Irene sighs)

1:01:33.758 --> 1:01:35.925
- Benjamin, get down here.

1:01:37.711 --> 1:01:38.794
- What is it?

1:01:40.438 --> 1:01:41.688
- They're gone.

1:01:44.210 --> 1:01:46.066
- Well, bullocks.

1:01:46.066 --> 1:01:48.566
(Irene sighs)

1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:52.663
- They left this morning.

1:01:55.650 --> 1:01:59.250
- Leonard, from now on,
never let the guests' keys

1:01:59.250 --> 1:02:00.843
out of your sight.

1:02:02.164 --> 1:02:03.844
(Irene sighs)

1:02:03.844 --> 1:02:06.594
(birds chirping)

1:02:09.905 --> 1:02:10.905
- It's okay.

1:02:12.690 --> 1:02:14.343
Anyway, she was nice.

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.142
I'm all right.

1:02:17.142 --> 1:02:19.892
(birds chirping)

1:02:34.857 --> 1:02:38.024
(door bells jangling)

1:02:43.350 --> 1:02:45.693
- You're in luck. We
just had a cancellation.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.113
Come on in.

1:02:52.942 --> 1:02:55.859
(liquids gurgling)

1:03:10.122 --> 1:03:12.164
- Oh, here we are.

1:03:12.164 --> 1:03:12.997
Victoria.

1:03:14.270 --> 1:03:16.833
You look great.

1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:18.883
Color is back.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:24.540
I think we can maintain for a while.

1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:27.610
He's healthy, and alone.

1:03:27.610 --> 1:03:31.359
So he can be our guest
for as long as we want.

1:03:31.359 --> 1:03:34.030
Now, I'm sure you're hungry so,

1:03:34.030 --> 1:03:35.810
let's not keep Mother waiting.

1:03:37.675 --> 1:03:38.592
Come along.

1:03:41.993 --> 1:03:46.993
(insects buzzing)
(slow eerie music)

1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:03.477
(door slams)

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:10.430
- [Irene] I thought you
might like something to eat.

1:05:10.430 --> 1:05:12.540
The doctor will be in soon.

1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:13.873
I hope you're comfortable.

1:05:14.864 --> 1:05:17.697
(insects buzzing)

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:31.310
- [Martin] You all right?

1:05:31.310 --> 1:05:32.330
What're you doing out here?

1:05:32.330 --> 1:05:34.150
- I couldn't hold it.

1:05:34.150 --> 1:05:36.720
Didn't wanna entertain any passer-bys.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.220
What're you doin' out here?

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:40.120
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:41.840
- Yeah.
- Patrolling.

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:43.033
You coming or going?

1:05:45.310 --> 1:05:46.880
- You been sheriff a long time, right?

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:49.420
I mean, you seem to know about
everything and everybody,

1:05:49.420 --> 1:05:50.920
like the Crumbs.

1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:53.430
Tell me, does the doctor
still see patients?

1:05:53.430 --> 1:05:54.890
- What's to know?

1:05:54.890 --> 1:05:57.150
The Crumbs are just regular
folks leading regular lives.

1:05:57.150 --> 1:05:59.763
- Huh. Right.

1:06:01.930 --> 1:06:04.663
Well, it's getting kinda dark out here.

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.283
Guess I'll be getting back to town.

1:06:08.283 --> 1:06:11.200
(slow tense music)

1:06:13.441 --> 1:06:15.350
(liquids gurgling)

1:06:15.350 --> 1:06:17.103
- Leonard, prep the donor.

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:21.560
- I'm afraid we're too late.

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:24.357
- No, no.

1:06:31.570 --> 1:06:34.237
Dammit. He must've just expired.

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:39.273
(Benjamin sighs)

1:06:39.273 --> 1:06:42.210
Well let's not let it be a total waste.

1:06:42.210 --> 1:06:43.830
He's still fresh.

1:06:43.830 --> 1:06:46.323
Leonard, wrap and dress the meat.

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:53.093
Mother, please tell Victoria I'm sorry.

1:06:55.539 --> 1:06:57.551
(stethoscope clunks)

1:06:57.551 --> 1:07:00.468
(liquids gurgling)

1:07:03.907 --> 1:07:07.074
(door bells clanging)

1:07:09.897 --> 1:07:11.590
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:07:11.590 --> 1:07:13.260
We're the Archers.

1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:15.140
We like to get straight to the point.

1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:17.030
- He thinks he's being funny.

1:07:17.030 --> 1:07:19.960
- [Mr. Archer] Um, we
saw a post on Facebook.

1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:21.483
- We don't have a reservation.

1:07:22.690 --> 1:07:25.560
- Oh, well, this is your lucky day.

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.659
Our reserved guest canceled.

1:07:27.659 --> 1:07:29.217
- [Mr. Archer] Oh.

1:07:29.217 --> 1:07:31.384
- [Mrs. Archer] Thank you.

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:34.940
- Victoria?

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:36.810
Dear, could you ask Leonard to come

1:07:36.810 --> 1:07:39.360
and collect our guests' bags?

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:41.927
- Oh, bags? No, um, this is it.

1:07:44.922 --> 1:07:45.755
- Well.

1:07:46.619 --> 1:07:49.536
(skillet sizzling)

1:07:59.979 --> 1:08:01.450
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

1:08:01.450 --> 1:08:02.540
- Oh, don't worry about us.

1:08:02.540 --> 1:08:04.440
You know, we brought our
own food. (clears throat)

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:06.129
Where do you keep your bowls?

1:08:06.129 --> 1:08:06.962
- [Irene] Bowls?

1:08:06.962 --> 1:08:08.003
- To soak my nuts.

1:08:11.860 --> 1:08:12.773
We're vegans.

1:08:14.317 --> 1:08:17.721
(Irene giggles)

1:08:17.721 --> 1:08:20.804
(footsteps clomping)

1:08:23.316 --> 1:08:24.442
(insects buzzing)

1:08:24.442 --> 1:08:25.692
- Huh. Figures.

1:08:34.689 --> 1:08:39.689
(liquids gurgling)
(deep scary music)

1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:42.973
- Wow.

1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:46.820
You got quite the set-up here.

1:08:50.101 --> 1:08:50.934
(wood thuds)

1:08:50.934 --> 1:08:52.658
(Mr. Archer thuds)

1:08:52.658 --> 1:08:55.991
(deep mysterious music)

1:08:57.730 --> 1:08:58.563
- Get the woman.

1:08:59.772 --> 1:09:03.656
(deep mysterious music)

1:09:03.656 --> 1:09:06.839
(door clicks open)

1:09:06.839 --> 1:09:08.657
(door clicks shut)

1:09:08.657 --> 1:09:11.990
(deep mysterious music)

1:09:22.071 --> 1:09:22.904
- Boo.

1:09:22.904 --> 1:09:23.972
(Mrs. Archer screams)

1:09:23.972 --> 1:09:26.889
(fluids squishing)

1:09:27.806 --> 1:09:31.139
(deep mysterious music)

1:09:46.978 --> 1:09:50.395
(Mrs. Archer whimpering)

1:09:51.936 --> 1:09:54.603
- Please, don't hurt me. Please.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:01.189
- Go get Victoria. I'll prep the donor.

1:10:01.189 --> 1:10:04.522
(deep mysterious music)

1:10:07.666 --> 1:10:08.499
Lovely.

1:10:10.783 --> 1:10:13.160
(door bangs)

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:18.160
(deep mysterious music)
(insects buzzing)

1:10:30.148 --> 1:10:32.898
(birds chirping)

1:10:39.990 --> 1:10:40.823
- Benjamin.

1:10:44.370 --> 1:10:45.283
Benjamin.

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:48.370
- Mother, what's wrong?

1:10:48.370 --> 1:10:50.120
- Where's your father?

1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:51.650
- He's in the workshop with Leonard.

1:10:51.650 --> 1:10:52.650
- Please go get him.

1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:03.670
- Mother needs you.

1:11:07.330 --> 1:11:10.230
- Take the SIM cards out of
those phones and destroy them.

1:11:16.780 --> 1:11:17.613
Mother?

1:11:19.930 --> 1:11:21.283
Oh, whatever is the matter?

1:11:22.970 --> 1:11:27.013
- Look at my face. I'm aging again.

1:11:29.891 --> 1:11:30.724
- Mother.

1:11:30.724 --> 1:11:31.724
- It's okay.

1:11:32.628 --> 1:11:34.795
We knew this could happen.

1:11:37.903 --> 1:11:39.933
- Come to the workshop with me.

1:11:40.900 --> 1:11:42.233
I have something for you.

1:11:43.223 --> 1:11:46.223
(slow somber music)

1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:00.323
Mother, I feel very strongly
about this new compound.

1:12:01.820 --> 1:12:04.440
Thanks to our vegan friends,

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:07.203
we have more than enough to
mix the new batch of serum.

1:12:15.707 --> 1:12:17.230
- And Victoria?

1:12:17.230 --> 1:12:18.283
- I finished earlier.

1:12:19.670 --> 1:12:20.583
I feel fine.

1:12:22.836 --> 1:12:25.820
(liquids gurgling)

1:12:25.820 --> 1:12:29.123
- You are such a good doctor.

1:12:30.549 --> 1:12:34.293
- Yes, well I suppose I am
above average, aren't I?

1:12:38.792 --> 1:12:40.020
- They were lost.

1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:42.053
- [Irene] And now they're found.

1:12:43.413 --> 1:12:48.413
(suspenseful tense music)
(computer keys clicking)

1:13:09.438 --> 1:13:12.355
(liquids gurgling)

1:13:16.095 --> 1:13:19.095
(deep somber music)

1:13:26.991 --> 1:13:29.658
(woman gasping)

1:13:31.690 --> 1:13:33.037
- You little bitch.

1:13:34.197 --> 1:13:36.780
(object thuds)

1:13:39.550 --> 1:13:40.463
- Dammit, Mother.

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:45.240
You should've waited for me
to make an extraction first.

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:48.680
Now her platelets can't
be salvaged for Victoria.

1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:49.653
It's too late.

1:13:51.198 --> 1:13:52.970
(Benjamin sighs)

1:13:52.970 --> 1:13:54.353
Put this in storage.

1:13:56.750 --> 1:13:57.873
Clean this mess up.

1:13:59.951 --> 1:14:02.421
(tense suspenseful music)

1:14:02.421 --> 1:14:07.421
(liquid dribbling)
(eerie music)

1:14:08.551 --> 1:14:12.051
(tense suspenseful music)

1:14:31.877 --> 1:14:34.627
(birds chirping)

1:14:37.706 --> 1:14:40.420
(Benjamin sighs)

1:14:40.420 --> 1:14:41.823
She's getting worse.

1:14:43.890 --> 1:14:45.840
She hasn't got long now.

1:14:47.693 --> 1:14:50.773
I need to replace her kidneys.

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:55.333
- How long?

1:14:56.950 --> 1:14:58.063
- Few weeks.

1:14:59.660 --> 1:15:01.243
Months at best.

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:04.480
- Your father would know what to do.

1:15:05.542 --> 1:15:08.542
(slow somber music)

1:15:13.290 --> 1:15:15.040
- You don't have to hide the truth.

1:15:16.230 --> 1:15:18.195
I'm certainly old enough.

1:15:18.195 --> 1:15:21.195
(slow somber music)

1:15:31.390 --> 1:15:32.643
- You can't leave.

1:15:35.710 --> 1:15:39.257
This is where you belong. Here, with me.

1:15:39.257 --> 1:15:42.670
- You don't understand. I'm not normal.

1:15:42.670 --> 1:15:44.483
This is not normal.

1:15:46.183 --> 1:15:47.660
- You just need more serum, that's all.

1:15:47.660 --> 1:15:50.030
- I don't need more serum.

1:15:50.030 --> 1:15:52.593
You don't get it. Do you?

1:15:54.366 --> 1:15:57.033
(Leonard sighs)

1:15:57.914 --> 1:15:59.747
- I want to marry you.

1:16:02.544 --> 1:16:04.264
I love you.

1:16:04.264 --> 1:16:06.847
(gentle music)

1:16:09.886 --> 1:16:11.219
- Oh my Leonard.

1:16:12.065 --> 1:16:14.565
Oh my big, beautiful Leonard.

1:16:18.687 --> 1:16:21.143
I'm a hemophiliac with a club foot.

1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:26.560
My parents are my grandmother, Irene,

1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:29.073
and my father, Dr. Benjamin, her son.

1:16:29.934 --> 1:16:30.767
Her son.

1:16:33.830 --> 1:16:36.893
I'm a product of the
worst kind of coupling,

1:16:39.670 --> 1:16:40.543
incest.

1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:44.633
- So?

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:48.983
- My kidneys are damaged, Leonard.

1:16:51.460 --> 1:16:54.113
I heard them talking. I've
only got a few weeks left.

1:16:56.150 --> 1:16:58.213
I don't know, maybe more.

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:02.237
They need replacing or something.

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:10.490
- I'm not giving up on you.

1:17:16.010 --> 1:17:16.997
- Look at this one.

1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:19.293
That's Dr. Benjamin.

1:17:21.010 --> 1:17:23.320
- I don't know. It may be his grandfather.

1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:25.380
There's a striking resemblance.

1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:28.170
As for the body, the doc often
helps out the county corner.

1:17:28.170 --> 1:17:29.003
Not unusual.

1:17:31.100 --> 1:17:33.110
- I have to come clean with you, sheriff.

1:17:33.110 --> 1:17:35.060
The girl in the photograph is my niece.

1:17:36.389 --> 1:17:37.639
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1:17:38.660 --> 1:17:40.330
How long has she been missing?

1:17:40.330 --> 1:17:41.163
- About a month.

1:17:42.749 --> 1:17:45.173
Her father died, my brother.

1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:49.670
- Are you really a licensed PI?

1:17:49.670 --> 1:17:51.970
- I'm investigating what
happened to my niece.

1:17:53.411 --> 1:17:56.633
I, I just get this really weird
feeling about those people.

1:18:00.940 --> 1:18:02.450
- Tell you what.

1:18:02.450 --> 1:18:05.400
I'll meet you out there tomorrow.
We'll take a look around.

1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:07.910
- Okay.

1:18:07.910 --> 1:18:08.743
Thanks, sheriff.

1:18:08.743 --> 1:18:10.320
- You bet.

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:12.820
(tense music)

1:18:14.974 --> 1:18:16.932
Morning, Dr. B.

1:18:16.932 --> 1:18:18.640
- Morning sheriff, pleasure.

1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:19.700
What brings you out?

1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:20.533
- I asked him.

1:18:20.533 --> 1:18:21.400
- No big deal.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:23.710
He says he may have found
something I'd be interested in.

1:18:23.710 --> 1:18:25.870
Mind if I take a look, doc?

1:18:25.870 --> 1:18:26.850
- Sure.

1:18:26.850 --> 1:18:30.480
Leonard, show Sheriff Martin
and Mr. Valente around.

1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:31.580
- Let's look in there.

1:18:32.744 --> 1:18:35.661
(slow tense music)

1:18:53.661 --> 1:18:56.578
(liquids gurgling)

1:18:58.033 --> 1:19:00.310
- I apologize for the mess.

1:19:00.310 --> 1:19:01.165
If I'd have known you were coming,

1:19:01.165 --> 1:19:03.415
I would have made the
place more presentable.

1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:07.120
- What about the body?

1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:08.133
- Oh, you saw that.

1:19:09.430 --> 1:19:12.090
Sorry. Poor girl.

1:19:12.090 --> 1:19:13.320
Sent her body back to the morgue

1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:14.913
after I finished my autopsy.

1:19:17.410 --> 1:19:18.403
It was a homicide.

1:19:20.771 --> 1:19:23.354
(Angel scoffs)

1:19:32.627 --> 1:19:34.690
- I hope you feel better now.

1:19:34.690 --> 1:19:36.133
Dr. Benjamin is a good man.

1:19:37.390 --> 1:19:39.623
If you wanna look some more,
we can go back in there.

1:19:41.270 --> 1:19:42.670
Irene said to give you this.

1:19:43.963 --> 1:19:44.796
Enjoy.

1:19:45.939 --> 1:19:48.689
(birds chirping)

1:20:05.401 --> 1:20:08.484
(slow gentle music)

1:20:35.110 --> 1:20:36.897
- What's wrong with Leonard?

1:20:39.010 --> 1:20:42.423
- Nothing's wrong with
Leonard, darling, he's fine.

1:20:47.020 --> 1:20:50.588
- Then what?

1:20:50.588 --> 1:20:54.463
- Oh, Victoria. Do I
really need to say it?

1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:58.773
- Say what? Leonard is my friend.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:04.420
- I know. But he's not family.

1:21:04.420 --> 1:21:08.613
Family can be more than family, you know?

1:21:11.523 --> 1:21:13.573
- I, I don't think that way.

1:21:16.250 --> 1:21:20.500
I mean, about you, other than family.

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:22.030
- Why not?

1:21:22.030 --> 1:21:23.493
- I want to be with Leonard.

1:21:26.750 --> 1:21:27.583
Not you.

1:21:31.535 --> 1:21:32.567
You're my father.

1:21:34.230 --> 1:21:35.063
Remember?

1:21:36.900 --> 1:21:38.210
- Victoria, I...

1:21:41.490 --> 1:21:43.445
(Benjamin sighs)

1:21:43.445 --> 1:21:46.445
(slow somber music)

1:21:49.064 --> 1:21:51.300
- [Irene] Well she's a
grown woman. She's lonely.

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:55.487
- Oh, I know. I only
want what's best for her.

1:21:55.487 --> 1:21:57.650
And of course I like Leonard, but he's-

1:21:57.650 --> 1:21:58.483
- What?

1:22:00.979 --> 1:22:01.812
He's what?

1:22:01.812 --> 1:22:05.890
- Oh, Lenny. You're an
educated person, be logical.

1:22:06.814 --> 1:22:08.764
- What does logic have to do with this?

1:22:09.738 --> 1:22:11.226
Why don't you just say it?

1:22:11.226 --> 1:22:14.222
(deep tense music)

1:22:14.222 --> 1:22:15.293
(Benjamin groans)

1:22:15.293 --> 1:22:16.235
Say it!
- Lenny.

1:22:16.235 --> 1:22:17.068
- Lenny, calm down.

1:22:17.068 --> 1:22:19.054
Lenny, calm down. Lenny.
- Stop, Lenny.

1:22:19.054 --> 1:22:20.387
- Say it.

1:22:20.387 --> 1:22:21.733
- Stop.
- He's black.

1:22:21.733 --> 1:22:23.802
- I didn't mean it like that, Lenny.

1:22:23.802 --> 1:22:25.098
- Lenny, please, please, let him go.

1:22:25.098 --> 1:22:27.954
- Please. I'm sorry.
- Please.

1:22:27.954 --> 1:22:30.954
(Benjamin coughing)

1:22:33.764 --> 1:22:35.073
(Leonard yells)

1:22:35.073 --> 1:22:36.444
(door slams)

1:22:36.444 --> 1:22:37.606
(Benjamin sighs)

1:22:37.606 --> 1:22:39.023
- Benjamin, stop.

1:22:40.037 --> 1:22:41.620
- That boy-

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:43.536
- Stop it, stop it, stop, stop.

1:22:43.536 --> 1:22:44.369
(Benjamin breathing heavily)

1:22:44.369 --> 1:22:45.493
Stop it. Okay?

1:22:46.341 --> 1:22:47.258
Look at me.

1:22:48.984 --> 1:22:51.032
(birds tweeting)

1:22:51.032 --> 1:22:54.199
(footsteps crunching)

1:22:55.802 --> 1:22:58.719
(Benjamin sighing)

1:23:21.350 --> 1:23:22.183
- Why, hello.

1:23:23.530 --> 1:23:24.363
Hi there.

1:23:31.090 --> 1:23:32.163
Nice pole.

1:23:33.370 --> 1:23:34.270
You goin' fishing?

1:23:38.510 --> 1:23:39.760
What are you fishing for?

1:23:40.987 --> 1:23:42.792
- Whatever's hungry, I guess.

1:23:42.792 --> 1:23:45.533
- Hm. What kind of bait you using?

1:23:46.610 --> 1:23:49.740
- I have some worms that
my daddy bought for me.

1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:50.573
- Oh.

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.450
Well, where's your daddy now?

1:23:54.663 --> 1:23:58.079
- He's doing other things. Chop wood.

1:23:58.079 --> 1:23:58.912
- Oh.

1:24:01.369 --> 1:24:02.369
Well, you know what.

1:24:03.410 --> 1:24:07.793
I happen to have some of
the best bait in the county.

1:24:09.290 --> 1:24:11.040
I'm Dr. Benjamin Crump.

1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:13.573
I live in the big house
just up over there.

1:24:15.368 --> 1:24:18.118
You know what, if you follow
me, I'll fix you right up.

1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:24.200
And, Mrs. Crumb, just
baked a peach cobbler today

1:24:25.430 --> 1:24:27.773
that I think needs taste-testing.

1:24:29.627 --> 1:24:32.477
You wanna come with me? It's
just right through that way.

1:24:41.062 --> 1:24:44.145
(deep ominous music)

1:25:01.265 --> 1:25:04.265
(boy's neck cracks)

1:25:08.819 --> 1:25:12.569
(Benjamin breathing heavily)

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.517
(Benjamin sighing)

1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:29.633
I know you probably don't want
to hear what I have to say.

1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:33.533
I understand.

1:26:36.550 --> 1:26:38.713
I just never figured this.

1:26:41.790 --> 1:26:43.693
I hope you can accept my apology.

1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:45.693
I'm sorry.

1:26:47.110 --> 1:26:49.910
I never meant to make you feel like...

1:26:52.620 --> 1:26:53.533
- Like what?

1:26:54.425 --> 1:26:57.175
(birds chirping)

1:27:12.250 --> 1:27:13.823
- I met someone in the woods.

1:27:15.489 --> 1:27:17.389
I need you to take care of him for me.

1:27:18.485 --> 1:27:21.783
He's uh, beyond the brush
in a small clearing.

1:27:23.010 --> 1:27:25.760
(birds chirping)

1:27:46.284 --> 1:27:49.284
(deep somber music)

1:27:58.583 --> 1:28:01.333
(Leonard crying)

1:28:05.904 --> 1:28:08.737
(shovel stamping)

1:28:10.876 --> 1:28:13.876
(deep somber music)

1:28:35.763 --> 1:28:37.096
- He lived here.

1:28:41.222 --> 1:28:44.075
(Leonard breathing heavily)

1:28:44.075 --> 1:28:45.576
Did you get everything?

1:28:45.576 --> 1:28:46.909
- [Leonard] Yes.

1:28:49.090 --> 1:28:50.083
- The bin is full,

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.763
unless you need it.

1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:57.933
- No.

1:29:01.990 --> 1:29:04.057
- Bury him in it.

1:29:04.057 --> 1:29:05.390
- I already did.

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:18.903
(gentle music)

1:29:42.548 --> 1:29:45.215
(ominous music)

1:29:56.652 --> 1:29:59.358
(man breathing heavily)

1:29:59.358 --> 1:30:00.191
(man in trees winces)

1:30:00.191 --> 1:30:02.970
(woman screams)

1:30:02.970 --> 1:30:04.603
I want to show you something.

1:30:05.930 --> 1:30:08.353
Please, Victoria? Please?

1:30:14.555 --> 1:30:17.190
(liquids gurgling)

1:30:17.190 --> 1:30:18.023
Don't peak.

1:30:20.660 --> 1:30:21.853
I said don't peak.

1:30:23.330 --> 1:30:25.200
Okay. You can look.

1:30:26.152 --> 1:30:29.069
(liquids gurgling)

1:30:31.602 --> 1:30:33.435
- You did this for me?

1:30:37.900 --> 1:30:38.883
Why?

1:30:38.883 --> 1:30:41.800
(Leonard laughing)

1:30:42.686 --> 1:30:43.519
- Leonard.

1:30:45.710 --> 1:30:46.563
Victoria.

1:30:50.470 --> 1:30:51.793
Where did she come from?

1:30:53.540 --> 1:30:54.683
Did you find her?

1:30:55.850 --> 1:30:57.050
- Leonard did it for me.

1:30:58.690 --> 1:30:59.863
- For her transplant.

1:31:01.530 --> 1:31:02.880
They were out in the woods.

1:31:04.137 --> 1:31:06.113
- I must run several tests first.

1:31:08.230 --> 1:31:09.663
They?

1:31:09.663 --> 1:31:12.133
- She had a friend. He's done.

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:18.563
- Give her an IV. Prep her for testing.

1:31:19.700 --> 1:31:21.250
I must check for compatibility.

1:31:23.020 --> 1:31:26.163
Keep her quiet and out of
site. Take her to your place.

1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:31.830
- [Irene] And what if it fails?

1:31:34.735 --> 1:31:36.032
- I don't know.

1:31:36.032 --> 1:31:38.699
(curious music)

1:31:42.314 --> 1:31:44.397
But we owe her this much.

1:31:46.780 --> 1:31:48.626
She has nothing else.

1:31:48.626 --> 1:31:51.293
(curious music)

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:58.310
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

1:32:19.010 --> 1:32:19.843
- Hi.

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:23.980
I'm sure you didn't expect to see me back.

1:32:34.570 --> 1:32:37.040
I'm sorry I didn't stay to say thank you.

1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:38.240
- [Victoria] Or goodbye.

1:32:39.686 --> 1:32:40.519
- I am sorry.

1:32:41.923 --> 1:32:43.823
You know, you folks were very kind to me.

1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:46.727
Saved me and,

1:32:49.170 --> 1:32:50.047
I'm glad you did.

1:32:52.350 --> 1:32:56.110
- Well we are very glad to have you back.

1:32:56.110 --> 1:32:58.650
- Yes, and uh, we have no guests.

1:32:58.650 --> 1:33:00.799
So you're welcome to stay the night.

1:33:00.799 --> 1:33:01.799
- Yes, stay.

1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:08.273
- Sure. Why not?

1:33:09.860 --> 1:33:12.008
- Well that's settled then.

1:33:12.008 --> 1:33:14.010
(glasses clinking)

1:33:14.010 --> 1:33:16.510
(eerie music)

1:33:27.721 --> 1:33:29.650
- [Victoria] Leaving again?

1:33:29.650 --> 1:33:31.420
- Sorry, I didn't see you coming.

1:33:31.420 --> 1:33:34.130
Uh, no, not till the morning.

1:33:34.130 --> 1:33:35.927
- I'm glad you came back.

1:33:35.927 --> 1:33:36.933
You look happier.

1:33:42.130 --> 1:33:44.573
Can I ask you a personal question?

1:33:46.150 --> 1:33:46.983
- Sure.

1:33:47.851 --> 1:33:49.483
- (sighs) Why?

1:33:51.270 --> 1:33:53.043
- Why did I leave?

1:33:54.942 --> 1:33:58.993
- (sighs) Why did you
try to kill yourself?

1:33:59.978 --> 1:34:03.130
You, you, you don't have to
tell me if you don't want to.

1:34:03.130 --> 1:34:08.130
I just, I, you look like
you're well-cared for.

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:11.530
- Well, too well-cared for, that's,

1:34:11.530 --> 1:34:13.613
that's part of the problem.

1:34:13.613 --> 1:34:14.703
- I don't understand.

1:34:16.150 --> 1:34:20.530
You're handsome, and I mean,
you seem to have money and...

1:34:23.410 --> 1:34:28.410
- I have a fiance, and she's
beautiful and a nice person,

1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:33.130
but I don't love her.

1:34:35.610 --> 1:34:36.763
I love someone else.

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:39.780
- Who? Who?

1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:40.763
Who is it you love?

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:45.840
I'm sorry. That, that's
none of my business.

1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:47.110
I shouldn't have asked.

1:34:47.110 --> 1:34:49.320
- I just, I don't think you'd understand.

1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:51.600
My parents certainly wouldn't.

1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:52.433
- Why?

1:34:53.860 --> 1:34:54.743
Is it race?

1:34:59.090 --> 1:35:04.090
- I love women, but I've
never been in love with one.

1:35:07.610 --> 1:35:08.853
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

1:35:08.853 --> 1:35:10.308
I don't even know you.

1:35:10.308 --> 1:35:11.523
- Well maybe that's why.

1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:15.170
We don't know each other
to judge each other.

1:35:17.970 --> 1:35:19.420
It's getting a little chilly.

1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:20.970
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1:35:22.230 --> 1:35:23.063
- Yeah.

1:35:24.192 --> 1:35:27.025
(insects buzzing)

1:35:32.782 --> 1:35:34.115
Let me get that.

1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.863
You two have gotta be right
out of Homes and Garden.

1:35:46.930 --> 1:35:48.530
You remind me of my grandmother.

1:35:51.950 --> 1:35:53.333
She recently passed away.

1:35:58.210 --> 1:35:59.297
God, I miss her.

1:36:03.068 --> 1:36:06.401
I mean I, I could tell my nana anything.

1:36:10.073 --> 1:36:12.020
I used to call her nana.

1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:12.853
Silly, huh?

1:36:13.831 --> 1:36:16.831
(slow somber music)

1:36:23.305 --> 1:36:25.805
I guess I still call her that.

1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:29.990
I'm gonna miss her.

1:36:32.827 --> 1:36:34.725
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just-

1:36:34.725 --> 1:36:36.940
- Oh, no, no, no.

1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:38.490
What's wrong, what is it? Stay.

1:36:39.453 --> 1:36:43.906
- I'm sorry. I just can't help myself.

1:36:43.906 --> 1:36:48.906
(Carmen sobbing)
- Oh, sh, sh, sh.

1:36:49.679 --> 1:36:53.804
It's okay.

1:36:53.804 --> 1:36:55.462
It's okay.

1:36:55.462 --> 1:36:58.129
(gentle music)

1:37:09.139 --> 1:37:11.889
You remind me of my late brother.

1:37:13.395 --> 1:37:18.395
He was the sensitive one.

1:37:19.125 --> 1:37:23.083
He too was special.

1:37:28.670 --> 1:37:33.017
You should never be
ashamed to be who you are.

1:37:35.803 --> 1:37:37.720
You are a handsome man.

1:37:38.617 --> 1:37:39.940
I'm sure that the person
you love, loves you back.

1:37:48.670 --> 1:37:50.583
And that is all that counts.

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:55.943
Right, Victoria?

1:37:58.590 --> 1:38:00.180
- Yes, Mother.

1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:02.763
(gentle music)

1:38:10.386 --> 1:38:15.386
(liquid gurgling)
(Benjamin humming)

1:38:20.516 --> 1:38:25.120
- When I finish here, I
will prep your patient.

1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:25.953
- Very good.

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:31.303
Go bring Victoria down,
and begin her transfusion.

1:38:38.790 --> 1:38:39.623
- Victoria.

1:38:40.607 --> 1:38:42.257
Dr. B will be ready for you soon.

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:44.760
- For what?

1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:48.523
- [Leonard] Dr. B wants you in
the lab for serum injections.

1:38:50.863 --> 1:38:52.040
- Who? Who is the donor?

1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:53.390
- [Leonard] Motorcycle man.

1:38:59.347 --> 1:39:02.264
(spoon clattering)

1:39:04.954 --> 1:39:06.650
- I don't understand.

1:39:06.650 --> 1:39:09.410
- You said she would be okay for awhile.

1:39:09.410 --> 1:39:11.980
- She will be, but this is an opportunity

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:14.523
to give her system a badly needed boost.

1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:18.330
- Father, we can't do this.

1:39:18.330 --> 1:39:19.180
- What're you talking about?

1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:22.150
Of course we can. We need to.

1:39:22.150 --> 1:39:23.520
Leonard, where's the donor?

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:24.783
- He's not a donor.

1:39:27.350 --> 1:39:28.363
He's a person.

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:30.830
- Of course he is.

1:39:30.830 --> 1:39:32.230
They're all people.

1:39:32.230 --> 1:39:34.400
But he doesn't have a
reservation, does he?

1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:35.533
Leonard, go get him.

1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:39.817
- [Irene] Why? We don't need him yet.

1:39:40.730 --> 1:39:42.053
- Of course we need him.

1:39:42.910 --> 1:39:44.810
I can put the serum in storage,

1:39:44.810 --> 1:39:47.090
but Victoria needs this transfusion.

1:39:47.090 --> 1:39:48.993
Now Leonard, go get the donor.

1:39:51.620 --> 1:39:52.453
- Huh-uh.

1:39:53.790 --> 1:39:54.773
- I won't do it.

1:39:59.250 --> 1:40:01.241
- Victoria, wait.

1:40:01.241 --> 1:40:04.010
(ominous music)

1:40:04.010 --> 1:40:05.033
He's perfect.

1:40:06.180 --> 1:40:07.363
This is important.

1:40:08.860 --> 1:40:09.913
This is your life.

1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:13.696
- What about his life?

1:40:13.696 --> 1:40:16.775
(ominous music)

1:40:16.775 --> 1:40:18.010
- I don't understand.

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:21.190
He's a perfect fit for Victoria.

1:40:21.190 --> 1:40:23.520
She needs this transfusion now.

1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:25.103
- We can't do it.

1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:28.410
Not him anyway.

1:40:28.410 --> 1:40:30.110
- Why not?

1:40:30.110 --> 1:40:32.040
He doesn't have a reservation.

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.823
- Will you stop already
with this reservation crap!

1:40:38.860 --> 1:40:42.273
- Irene, we swore to this.

1:40:42.273 --> 1:40:43.343
This is important.

1:40:44.870 --> 1:40:47.531
- And you swore not to do
harm to others. Remember?

1:40:47.531 --> 1:40:50.299
- (laughs) Don't lecture me on ethics.

1:40:50.299 --> 1:40:52.490
My work is for the good of all mankind.

1:40:52.490 --> 1:40:56.733
- Don't you lecture me on the
importance of life, Benjamin.

1:40:58.394 --> 1:40:59.311
Cameron is,

1:41:02.220 --> 1:41:03.823
Cameron is very special.

1:41:05.157 --> 1:41:07.313
- Precisely why he must be the donor.

1:41:09.470 --> 1:41:11.143
- He's not like the others.

1:41:13.230 --> 1:41:14.063
He's gay.

1:41:15.988 --> 1:41:17.638
(Benjamin laughs)

1:41:17.638 --> 1:41:18.471
- And?

1:41:19.567 --> 1:41:22.953
He's very healthy, and a
perfect fit for Victoria.

1:41:25.430 --> 1:41:29.533
- He will not be the donor.

1:41:30.544 --> 1:41:33.461
(liquids gurgling)

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:40.010
- Bloody hell.

1:41:48.286 --> 1:41:49.286
- Thank you.

1:41:50.410 --> 1:41:51.870
Victoria, thank you.

1:41:53.283 --> 1:41:56.033
(birds chirping)

1:42:16.201 --> 1:42:19.951
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

1:42:22.170 --> 1:42:23.440
- I want this done immediately.

1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.500
She cannot stay at Leonard's.

1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.250
- Well, first I need to get-

1:42:27.250 --> 1:42:30.693
- Benjamin, I said I
want it done immediately.

1:42:32.090 --> 1:42:35.263
- Yes, Mother, we'll do it tonight.

1:42:36.239 --> 1:42:37.072
(cleaver thuds)

1:42:37.072 --> 1:42:39.333
Leonard, go tell Victoria.

1:42:47.260 --> 1:42:50.010
(birds chirping)

1:42:52.637 --> 1:42:56.590
(phone keys clicking)

1:42:56.590 --> 1:42:58.290
- Sheriff Martin, please.

1:42:58.290 --> 1:42:59.123
Angel Valente.

1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:03.010
Tell him I found a missing person's poster

1:43:03.010 --> 1:43:04.990
of the girl with her throat cut.

1:43:04.990 --> 1:43:05.823
Yes, cut.

1:43:07.250 --> 1:43:10.231
Just tell him I'll meet him
over at the Crumbs' cottage.

1:43:10.231 --> 1:43:11.064
Thank you.

1:43:12.292 --> 1:43:15.209
(deep tense music)

1:43:18.862 --> 1:43:21.695
(insects buzzing)

1:43:24.268 --> 1:43:27.018
(brush rustling)

1:43:43.939 --> 1:43:47.439
(tense suspenseful music)

1:44:08.028 --> 1:44:10.035
It's okay, just, okay.

1:44:10.035 --> 1:44:11.952
All right, just, quick.

1:44:13.632 --> 1:44:16.124
Okay, go, go, go, go.

1:44:16.124 --> 1:44:17.672
(tense suspenseful music)

1:44:17.672 --> 1:44:19.118
Okay, okay, okay, wait.

1:44:19.118 --> 1:44:21.098
The road's right there. Now you go.

1:44:21.098 --> 1:44:22.115
- No, you have to go with me.

1:44:22.115 --> 1:44:23.654
- No, no. You contact Sheriff Martin.

1:44:23.654 --> 1:44:24.960
No, no. I have to go back.

1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:26.010
Go. Go.
- No.

1:44:26.010 --> 1:44:27.600
- [Irene] How did she get loose?

1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.200
She'll try to report it.

1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:31.650
- She must've had help. Her boyfriend?

1:44:31.650 --> 1:44:32.483
- Buried.

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:34.400
Mr. Valente?

1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:36.070
- [Irene] He didn't leave?

1:44:36.070 --> 1:44:37.770
- Find him and find the girl.

1:44:37.770 --> 1:44:39.870
- [Irene] They couldn't have gone too far.

1:44:41.664 --> 1:44:44.581
(deep tense music)

1:44:51.610 --> 1:44:54.193
(woman crying)

1:45:00.965 --> 1:45:02.465
- [Woman] Help me.

1:45:05.197 --> 1:45:06.893
- Get in. Calm down.

1:45:07.830 --> 1:45:09.510
You're safe now. You're safe now.

1:45:09.510 --> 1:45:11.333
I got you. Now calm down.

1:45:13.618 --> 1:45:17.118
(tense suspenseful music)

1:45:33.679 --> 1:45:35.293
- Stop right there.

1:45:35.293 --> 1:45:37.376
Put it down. Put it down.

1:45:38.968 --> 1:45:40.511
Get over there.

1:45:40.511 --> 1:45:41.880
Get over there.

1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:42.713
Turn around.

1:45:43.550 --> 1:45:44.383
Turn around.

1:45:45.846 --> 1:45:46.696
Get up that hill.

1:45:48.050 --> 1:45:49.023
Go on, move.

1:45:50.696 --> 1:45:51.529
Move.

1:45:56.416 --> 1:45:57.249
- Leonard.

1:45:58.561 --> 1:45:59.478
- Get back.

1:46:01.730 --> 1:46:02.563
Get back.

1:46:04.249 --> 1:46:06.400
All right. What's going on here?

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:08.093
You sick degenerates.

1:46:09.010 --> 1:46:12.570
- You couldn't possibly
know what's going on.

1:46:12.570 --> 1:46:13.923
This is beyond you.

1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:17.733
We are trying to save someone we love.

1:46:19.077 --> 1:46:20.373
What would you expect?

1:46:21.710 --> 1:46:23.083
She's our family.

1:46:24.750 --> 1:46:26.203
- Do you have children?

1:46:27.250 --> 1:46:29.727
- I had a niece, who you killed.

1:46:30.897 --> 1:46:32.333
Get the fuck back!

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.063
- Let me make you an offer, Mr. Valente.

1:46:41.620 --> 1:46:46.620
I can help you live as
long as you want. True.

1:46:48.900 --> 1:46:52.733
With no illness, and no further aging.

1:46:55.990 --> 1:46:58.763
- Yeah, how? By killing others?

1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.653
What gives you the right to play God?

1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:06.443
- Somebody has to, Mr. Valente.

1:47:07.606 --> 1:47:08.439
(door clicking)

1:47:08.439 --> 1:47:09.523
- About damn time.

1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:15.890
The girl on the missing persons was here.

1:47:15.890 --> 1:47:17.130
They killed her.

1:47:17.130 --> 1:47:18.940
They had another one over here.

1:47:18.940 --> 1:47:19.940
I helped her escape.

1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:22.790
- I picked her up on the highway.

1:47:22.790 --> 1:47:24.483
She's in my truck, safe.

1:47:26.707 --> 1:47:28.740
- Get back! Turn around.

1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:29.923
- Do as he says, Lenny.

1:47:31.151 --> 1:47:33.651
(eerie music)

1:47:36.889 --> 1:47:37.750
- Put your hands behind your back.

1:47:37.750 --> 1:47:41.055
(rifle cocks)

1:47:41.055 --> 1:47:43.805
(gunshot blasts)

1:47:48.181 --> 1:47:50.084
(knocking at window)

1:47:50.084 --> 1:47:50.917
(woman gasps)

1:47:50.917 --> 1:47:53.584
(woman screams)

1:47:57.764 --> 1:48:00.931
(door bells clanging)

1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:06.013
- Good afternoon. Do
you have reservations?

1:48:07.659 --> 1:48:10.576
(mysterious music)

1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:38.500
I prepared some sandwiches for you boys

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:40.580
in case you got hungry on the way.

1:48:40.580 --> 1:48:41.413
Meatloaf.

1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:47.853
- Bears.

1:48:49.995 --> 1:48:50.828
Come on.

1:48:53.056 --> 1:48:55.973
(mysterious music)

1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:07.340
- Where's our rifles at?

1:49:08.929 --> 1:49:09.830
- I said leave.

1:49:09.830 --> 1:49:11.403
- Go.
- Now.

1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:15.730
- When we get to this tree-

1:49:15.730 --> 1:49:16.563
- Uh-huh?

1:49:16.563 --> 1:49:17.550
- Just gonna run like hell.

1:49:17.550 --> 1:49:19.086
When you get to the top of the ridge,

1:49:19.086 --> 1:49:20.240
I'll meet you on the other side.

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:21.073
- All right.

1:49:21.073 --> 1:49:22.990
- Ready? Let's go.
- Go.

1:49:25.013 --> 1:49:27.596
(gunshots pop)

1:49:29.791 --> 1:49:33.124
(deep mysterious music)

1:50:23.613 --> 1:50:26.550
- Mother, your appetizers are delicious.

1:50:26.550 --> 1:50:28.067
Can't stop eating them.

1:50:28.067 --> 1:50:28.900
- How 'bout you, sheriff?

1:50:28.900 --> 1:50:31.815
- Oh, if I eat one more, I
might turn into a wienie.

1:50:31.815 --> 1:50:34.398
(all laughing)
