00:07.820 --> 00:09.080
(Episode 4)

00:20.559 --> 00:21.899
Goodness.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.199
Won Jae.

00:24.799 --> 00:26.870
Have you been playing\Ngames on my phone?

00:37.949 --> 00:39.749
All you need is...

00:40.119 --> 00:41.219
rubbing alcohol,

00:41.480 --> 00:43.649
a glass bottle,\Nand a lighter.

00:44.219 --> 00:45.850
The most important thing\Nis a truck.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.619
- A glass bottle, lighter.\N- It has to be...

00:49.560 --> 00:52.189
I can get rubbing alcohol\Nfrom the pharmacy.

00:53.359 --> 00:55.759
I just have to\Nset the truck on fire.

01:02.969 --> 01:07.939
(Wonjae Pharmacy)

01:07.939 --> 01:09.079
Hurry up!

01:22.220 --> 01:23.830
I knew it was\Nthe pharmacy.

01:24.089 --> 01:25.559
I sensed it\Nfrom the beginning.

01:26.229 --> 01:28.130
The second floor\Nis their house.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.800
The culprit went\Ninto the house.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.630
That's why he disappeared\Nbefore Hee Yeon.

01:35.270 --> 01:36.339
Let's go.

01:37.309 --> 01:38.539
Did you forget anything?

01:38.940 --> 01:40.279
Don't go anywhere\Nafter school.

01:40.279 --> 01:42.110
Make sure you come home\Nright after. Okay?

01:42.710 --> 01:43.710
Take this.

01:45.449 --> 01:47.619
The pharmacy\Nisn't open yet.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.250
Detective Ha Wan Seung of\NJoongjin Police Station.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.919
I came to ask\Na few questions...

01:50.919 --> 01:52.250
about serial arson.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.520
I love your outfit\Nand your bag.

01:54.690 --> 01:55.990
Did your mom\Nget them for you?

01:58.830 --> 01:59.830
But...

01:59.960 --> 02:02.229
your cute trainers look\Nrather worn out.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.470
But the heels\Naren't worn out yet.

02:05.470 --> 02:06.669
They seem new.

02:07.539 --> 02:08.770
Have you spilled...

02:09.000 --> 02:10.610
some acetone\Non them recently?

02:10.669 --> 02:12.770
- No, I haven't.\N- What are you doing?

02:12.770 --> 02:14.240
Have you played around\Nwith fire recently?

02:14.240 --> 02:15.640
What are you two doing?

02:20.619 --> 02:21.879
Get in the car.

02:21.879 --> 02:22.920
Okay.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.360
Our boy Won Jae...

02:29.360 --> 02:31.790
doesn't even have time to\Ngo around and start fire.

02:31.890 --> 02:32.999
He goes straight to\Nafter-school classes...

02:32.999 --> 02:34.099
as soon as school\Nfinishes.

02:34.099 --> 02:35.730
He comes home very late.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.670
What about the time\Nin between the classes?

02:38.099 --> 02:39.599
Between 3pm and 4pm,

02:40.399 --> 02:41.700
the crime was committed.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.070
What do you mean by that?\NHe's just a kid.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.379
You're an attorney\Nat Shingang Law Firm.

02:53.379 --> 02:54.920
Do you have a warrant?

02:54.920 --> 02:57.320
No. We just need to\Nask him a few things.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.990
If you bother my son\None more time,

03:01.689 --> 03:03.330
you'll have to\Nsee me in court.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.540
Won Jae.

03:18.839 --> 03:20.710
Yes, Dad?

03:21.839 --> 03:22.950
It's nothing.

03:23.749 --> 03:25.450
Come straight home\Nafter school.

03:25.450 --> 03:26.450
Okay.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.210
Where's the lighter?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.469
Where did it go?

03:54.179 --> 03:55.379
Are you sure?

03:55.379 --> 03:57.349
Yes, I think so.

03:57.349 --> 03:58.510
A kid did it?

03:58.710 --> 04:00.480
A grade-schooler\Nset my place on fire?

04:00.820 --> 04:02.349
Did you see\Nhis hands earlier?

04:02.520 --> 04:04.349
He touched acetone\Nwith bare hands...

04:04.349 --> 04:06.050
as he was pouring it\Ninto a bottle.

04:06.219 --> 04:07.719
You look so smart.

04:08.089 --> 04:09.589
Do you like candy?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.159
Thank you.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.529
His hair was burnt\Nat the front too.

04:19.570 --> 04:21.140
You're so polite.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.440
It's because he isn't\Nused to using a lighter.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.849
He's a strange kid.

04:31.279 --> 04:33.580
He could've used a match\Nor paper to start a fire.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.589
Why did he use\Na cigarette butt?

04:36.589 --> 04:37.950
Because he's\Na grade schooler.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.989
He even copied\Nthe unnecessary part.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.560
But he didn't copy\Nthe time of the crime.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.089
He couldn't.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.700
Because the school ends\Nat 2:30pm.

04:48.299 --> 04:49.870
(Dream big,\Nkeep your body healthy)

04:49.870 --> 04:52.669
Do you want to go see\N"Minnie's Adventure"?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.140
Yes, I'd love to.

04:54.299 --> 04:55.739
- You like it that much?\N- Ye Na!

04:56.140 --> 04:57.510
Hi, Won Jae.

04:58.169 --> 05:00.880
Won Jae, I'm going to\Nthe movies today.

05:00.880 --> 05:01.940
What are you doing today?

05:03.909 --> 05:04.979
It's a secret.

05:06.279 --> 05:07.419
Go inside.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.950
- See you.\N- Bye.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.719
- Goodbye, ma'am.\N- Let's go.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.060
That's hurts.

05:19.130 --> 05:21.399
He looks normal.\NWhy did he start the fire?

05:21.399 --> 05:23.799
Fire started.\NPeople screamed.

05:23.799 --> 05:25.969
Class was canceled.\NFiretrucks came.

05:26.130 --> 05:28.899
It must be a good show\Nfor kids.

05:29.039 --> 05:30.770
How did he become\Na copycat?

05:30.870 --> 05:32.469
I'm curious\Nabout that too.

05:32.870 --> 05:35.380
I'll ask Female and Youth\NDivision for help.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.310
I thought you were\Non vacation.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.149
They don't know that.

05:44.789 --> 05:46.890
(Female and Youth\NDivision)

05:46.890 --> 05:49.560
Lieutenant Ha. You said\Nyou were on vacation.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.089
News travels fast.

05:51.529 --> 05:52.830
You should take a rest.

05:53.330 --> 05:55.500
Why would you meddle with\NPolice Committee's son?

05:56.270 --> 05:57.700
Police Committee's son.

05:58.370 --> 05:59.969
To me, he's just a suspect\Nof arson.

06:00.070 --> 06:01.640
He's only nine years old.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.440
Are you saying we should\Nneglect crimes...

06:04.440 --> 06:05.940
that are committed\Nby kids?

06:06.279 --> 06:09.609
Help me, so he can\Nget some counseling.

06:09.609 --> 06:10.710
I don't know.

06:10.710 --> 06:13.349
Just don't get caught by\Nthe chief or the manager.

06:13.349 --> 06:15.279
People are complaining\Neven to the chief.

06:15.279 --> 06:16.620
Come on, help me.

06:16.789 --> 06:19.320
Wan Seung is supposed\Nto be on vacation.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.690
Why did he show up\Nmaking trouble?

06:22.419 --> 06:23.589
I'll send him...

06:23.960 --> 06:26.700
to Traffic Control\NDivision if I see him.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.830
That's not necessary.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.299
Just make sure the chief\Ndoesn't see him.

06:31.630 --> 06:33.839
I'm dying here.

06:33.839 --> 06:35.469
Look at this.

06:42.279 --> 06:44.680
Anyway, him and that lady\Nwill cause trouble...

06:44.680 --> 06:46.250
if they're together.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.450
Find out where she is\Nright now.

06:49.789 --> 06:50.890
Yes, sir.

07:02.729 --> 07:04.870
Just wait and see,\NManager Jo and Mr. Gye.

07:05.729 --> 07:08.140
We don't know when Won Jae\Nwill start a fire again.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.640
There's nothing we can do.

07:09.810 --> 07:11.109
We should keep\Nan eye on him.

07:11.109 --> 07:12.239
So he doesn't set\Nstuff on fire again.

07:12.239 --> 07:13.380
Let's go wait for him\Nat 2pm at school...

07:13.380 --> 07:14.479
since his school\Nends at 2:30pm.

07:14.479 --> 07:15.940
He's too dangerous\Nfor a kid.

07:16.349 --> 07:19.279
(Transmitter)

07:53.750 --> 07:56.120
Sir, why are you\Nclosing the gate?

07:56.390 --> 07:58.520
The fire alarm went off\Nall of a sudden.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.919
School closed early.

08:00.089 --> 08:01.190
What?

08:12.870 --> 08:14.399
Our boy Won Jae?

08:14.570 --> 08:17.270
My son didn't start\Nthe fire!

08:17.270 --> 08:19.010
This isn't good\Nfor Won Jae either.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.109
I'll take care of my kid.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.339
Get out right now.

08:22.339 --> 08:23.950
Is Won Jae home?

08:23.950 --> 08:25.510
He's at school of course.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.080
School was done\Ntwo hours ago.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.950
The classes finished\Nearly today.

08:32.190 --> 08:35.190
He didn't even tell me.

08:38.690 --> 08:40.400
If he isn't home yet...

08:40.400 --> 08:41.830
He's planning on starting\Na fire again.

08:54.609 --> 08:56.410
What is he trying\Nto burn today?

08:56.910 --> 08:58.680
He'll use Na Jin Tae's\Nmethod again.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.820
Won't he copy\Nthe exact order?

09:00.820 --> 09:02.280
First, it was Genoise's\Nfourth franchise.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.589
Then it was your house,\Nthen it was...

09:03.589 --> 09:06.150
the bathroom where\NNa Jin Tae was arrested.

09:06.150 --> 09:08.190
No. It's the other way.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.989
Quicklime takes a day\Nto get delivered.

09:10.989 --> 09:12.460
So it's my house,

09:12.460 --> 09:14.200
then Genoise's\Nfourth franchise.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.930
The order is different\Nfrom Na Jin Tae's.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.099
Is he doing it\Nrandomly then?

09:17.099 --> 09:18.800
He's a faithful copycat.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.739
He even copies\Nwhat's not necessary.

09:27.339 --> 09:28.339
(Dangerous Whisper)

09:28.339 --> 09:30.249
(Arbiter of Fire)

09:30.810 --> 09:31.879
What's that?

09:32.349 --> 09:33.349
(Arbiter of Fire)

09:33.349 --> 09:35.450
(Arbiter of Fire: Truck)

09:36.219 --> 09:37.690
He can't even park right.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.050
It's the truck.

10:04.950 --> 10:05.979
Truck?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.349
He's following\Nthe number of views.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.619
He sure is\Nacting like a kid.

10:12.450 --> 10:14.619
Somewhere a nine-year-old\Ncan get to on foot.

10:14.619 --> 10:15.690
A truck.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.660
Let's go to the\NTraffic Control Division.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
We'll find something\Nin the surveillance video.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.599
What it is?

10:23.599 --> 10:25.570
I think I know\Nwhere Won Jae is.

10:25.969 --> 10:27.869
I'm already under\Nso much stress.

10:27.869 --> 10:29.810
Why did he go to that\Nshabby place?

10:29.810 --> 10:31.040
My gosh.

10:34.109 --> 10:35.239
Where is she going?

10:36.550 --> 10:37.650
Follow her.

10:44.249 --> 10:46.619
To the right.

10:46.619 --> 10:48.790
You're too distracting.

10:52.530 --> 10:54.060
Which block...

10:54.060 --> 10:56.330
did you say\Nmy kid went to?

10:58.430 --> 11:00.940
Block 103? Thanks.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.570
Who lives in block 103?

11:05.239 --> 11:06.680
Ye Na's mother!

11:08.440 --> 11:10.979
Why did he go there?

11:13.249 --> 11:14.780
Mom, hurry up.

11:14.780 --> 11:17.019
What if the fruit truck\Nleaves?

11:17.019 --> 11:18.989
We have apples at home.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.889
But I really want it.\NPlease?

11:22.889 --> 11:24.759
Strawberries are\Nexpensive though.

11:39.070 --> 11:40.810
Hello, mister.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.580
You're here\Nfor strawberries, right?

11:42.879 --> 11:45.050
He already knows\Nyou love strawberries.

11:45.050 --> 11:47.879
Mister, I'm going\Nto the movies with Mom.

11:47.879 --> 11:49.920
Really?\NYou must be so happy.

11:59.359 --> 12:00.859
How much for\Na pack of strawberries?

12:00.859 --> 12:02.629
It's eight dollars a box.

12:02.629 --> 12:03.830
Take a look.

12:03.830 --> 12:05.030
This is eight dollars?

12:05.030 --> 12:07.099
That looks good.

12:23.849 --> 12:25.719
- Bye.\N- Goodbye.

12:25.719 --> 12:26.960
Bye.

12:33.729 --> 12:36.330
Gosh, he shouldn't\Nleave already.

12:44.109 --> 12:45.839
Wash it before you eat it.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.410
Yes, Won Jae's mom.

12:48.410 --> 12:50.009
I'll just eat it.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
Yes.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.379
Won Jae did?

13:01.489 --> 13:03.830
Did he want to\Nvisit our house?

13:04.489 --> 13:06.359
- It's tasty.\N- Okay.

13:10.030 --> 13:11.300
Okay.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.869
When he comes,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.369
I'll keep him with me.

13:17.109 --> 13:18.210
Watch out!

13:56.749 --> 13:58.249
Mom...

13:58.710 --> 13:59.920
Mom!

13:59.920 --> 14:01.019
Gosh!

14:02.719 --> 14:04.089
Mom...

14:04.389 --> 14:07.560
Let me go.

14:07.859 --> 14:10.030
Mom...

14:10.629 --> 14:13.160
I'm sorry.\NYou can't see it.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.900
Mom.

14:16.499 --> 14:18.330
Mom.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.239
Mom.

14:27.879 --> 14:30.009
Let me go.

14:34.379 --> 14:35.650
Mom.

14:51.330 --> 14:54.040
I'll tell them I came to\Nvisit Ye Na's house.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.239
It'll be all right.

14:56.869 --> 14:57.940
It's okay.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.820
Mom.

15:11.290 --> 15:13.519
Mom.

15:13.519 --> 15:15.290
Let me go.

15:15.690 --> 15:18.359
I came to hang out\Nwith Ye Na.

15:18.830 --> 15:19.830
Won Jae!

15:22.060 --> 15:23.099
Are you okay?

15:23.530 --> 15:24.700
Did you burn your finger?

15:25.070 --> 15:27.269
Did you get hurt\Nanywhere else?

15:27.269 --> 15:28.869
I need to investigate him.

15:29.670 --> 15:30.670
Why?

15:31.269 --> 15:33.109
He threw a firebomb\Nfrom the rooftop.

15:34.109 --> 15:36.009
Do you have proof\Nthat my son did it?

15:37.080 --> 15:39.009
Why do you think\Nhe burned his finger?

15:40.180 --> 15:41.879
- Let's go.\N- Can't you see her?

15:42.580 --> 15:43.989
Don't you feel\Nsorry for her?

15:44.650 --> 15:45.989
He's still a child.

15:45.989 --> 15:46.989
Don't you see\Nhe's in shock?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.160
What about\Nthat child then?

15:49.389 --> 15:51.290
How could you only\Nthink about your child?

15:52.060 --> 15:53.129
She...

15:53.129 --> 15:55.430
watched her mom get in\Nflames before her eyes.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.800
- It's okay.\N- Mom.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.310
Talk to my husband.

16:04.570 --> 16:05.570
Let's go.

16:20.389 --> 16:21.389
Get out of the car.

16:26.430 --> 16:27.560
Are you crazy?

16:27.830 --> 16:29.400
Won Jae was caught\Nin the act.

16:29.769 --> 16:30.830
I'll take him with me\Nto the police station.

16:30.830 --> 16:33.540
What authority do you have\Nto investigate him?

16:35.639 --> 16:37.170
Won Jae...

16:37.509 --> 16:39.440
is less than 10 years old.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.609
Don't you know...

16:40.609 --> 16:41.879
he's exempted from\Ncriminal responsibility?

16:41.879 --> 16:43.080
I need him to\Ngo voluntarily.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.650
I won't allow that\Nas his guardian.

16:46.719 --> 16:49.479
And arrest without warrant\Nis legally impossible.

16:49.479 --> 16:52.550
What will you do\Nabout this?

16:52.989 --> 16:54.389
My child...

16:54.389 --> 16:56.889
seems to be in shock.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.089
I'll make sure he gets\Ninvestigated tomorrow.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.729
We need to talk with him\Nat least for a minute.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.160
Then go ahead\Nand drag him.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.499
I'd love to see you try.

17:05.829 --> 17:06.969
Let them go.

17:07.638 --> 17:08.969
Don't you know it'll\Nbe late tomorrow?

17:09.239 --> 17:11.069
He'll tell Won Jae\Nwhat to say tomorrow.

17:11.269 --> 17:13.680
Do you have any other way?

17:26.150 --> 17:28.019
Mom...

17:33.700 --> 17:35.829
Mom.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.999
Mom.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.940
Mom.

17:45.969 --> 17:49.910
(Queen of Mystery 2)

17:52.110 --> 17:53.249
Make way.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.590
Do you hear me?\NAre you okay?

17:57.590 --> 17:58.650
Inject 5ml of morphine.

17:58.690 --> 17:59.819
Prepare the treatment.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.120
Hurry!

18:03.059 --> 18:05.360
Does she have any other\Nrelative or guardian?

18:06.529 --> 18:08.029
I don't think she has any.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.430
We'll keep her\Nfor the time being.

18:12.799 --> 18:14.400
But if the treatment\Ngets long,

18:14.539 --> 18:16.440
she will have to be\Nmoved to an orphanage.

18:16.940 --> 18:20.079
We only have a temporary\Nresidential center here.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.120
Mom...

18:31.920 --> 18:32.920
Mom.

18:35.059 --> 18:36.960
Well... Take this.

18:37.890 --> 18:40.430
I want to go see my mom.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
Mom...

18:44.029 --> 18:45.900
Mom.

18:47.239 --> 18:49.440
Mom...

18:50.670 --> 18:52.170
Mom.

18:52.509 --> 18:54.210
Mom.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.549
She survived,

20:04.110 --> 20:05.279
but she suffered\Nmore than...

20:05.579 --> 20:07.950
three-degree burns\Non her face and body.

20:08.479 --> 20:10.190
How long will\Nher treatment take?

20:10.489 --> 20:12.519
Considering her facial\Nreconstructive surgery,

20:13.160 --> 20:14.590
it could take\Nher whole life.

20:17.690 --> 20:20.930
Ye Na doesn't have anyone\Nwho can take care of her.

20:28.069 --> 20:29.340
Detective Ha.

20:34.079 --> 20:35.079
Yes?

20:35.640 --> 20:38.249
You know our dad gets\Nreleased today, right?

20:40.420 --> 20:42.479
I thought you should know.

20:43.519 --> 20:44.549
Wan Seung.

20:45.719 --> 20:47.590
I know you're very busy,

20:48.420 --> 20:50.390
but make sure you come to\Nthe inauguration ceremony.

20:50.860 --> 20:51.860
Okay?

20:52.229 --> 20:55.329
It's still cold\Nin the morning and night.

20:55.329 --> 20:56.870
Be careful not to\Ncatch a cold.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.630
Don't skip meals\Nbecause you're busy.

20:58.630 --> 21:00.700
Make sure you take\Nyour meals on time.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.469
What?

21:03.710 --> 21:06.309
Right, I'm nagging.

21:06.979 --> 21:09.650
Okay, I'll stop it.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.579
Take care.

21:12.809 --> 21:13.850
Good work, sir.

21:15.219 --> 21:16.249
Dad.

21:17.090 --> 21:18.090
Hi.

21:19.350 --> 21:20.519
You must've\Ngone through a lot.

21:20.519 --> 21:22.090
You didn't have to come.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.529
You must be busy preparing\Nfor the ceremony.

21:24.529 --> 21:26.860
Dad, let's go\Nto the hospital first.

21:27.930 --> 21:28.999
No.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.400
Let's get\Nthe ceremony done first.

21:31.630 --> 21:33.499
I'll take care of it.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.469
Your condition might get\Nworse at this rate.

21:35.969 --> 21:39.210
I need to show them\Nthat I'm still fine.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.079
If they see that I'm weak,

21:42.880 --> 21:45.749
they'll come at me\Nlike hyenas.

21:59.660 --> 22:01.829
Be careful. It hurts.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.600
Get your wounds treated\Nproperly on time.

22:06.340 --> 22:07.340
Then again,

22:08.840 --> 22:10.309
it's nothing...

22:10.809 --> 22:12.140
compared to Ye Na's mom.

22:13.110 --> 22:14.640
Only if I were\Na second faster...

22:15.880 --> 22:17.210
Don't blame yourself.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.450
We did our best.

22:19.110 --> 22:21.049
There's no use in finding\Nout who the culprit is.

22:21.850 --> 22:23.390
We couldn't stop this.

22:27.090 --> 22:30.460
Won Jae, were you the one\Nwho threw the fire...

22:31.690 --> 22:32.930
from the rooftop?

22:37.829 --> 22:40.999
Won Jae, you can't\Nlie to your dad.

22:43.009 --> 22:46.680
You have to tell me\Nso that I can protect you.

22:47.410 --> 22:48.410
Okay?

22:57.519 --> 22:59.319
Did you ever\Nstart a fire before?

23:00.219 --> 23:02.390
Yes. Twice.

23:05.059 --> 23:06.799
How on earth\Ndid you bring him up?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.930
What? Both of us work.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.299
Why are you blaming\Nit only on me?

23:11.499 --> 23:13.100
Are you joking with me?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.370
Am I wrong?

23:14.370 --> 23:16.069
You sit around\Nin the pharmacy all day.

23:16.069 --> 23:18.440
Why do you have no idea...

23:18.440 --> 23:20.110
where he's been\Nafter school?

23:20.110 --> 23:21.840
You didn't do\Nanything either.

23:22.210 --> 23:24.049
He's only nine years old.

23:24.049 --> 23:26.110
What are we going to\Ndo about a little kid?

23:26.110 --> 23:28.319
Do we put him in prison?\NDo we charge him?

23:28.319 --> 23:30.489
He's too young to be\Nput in a detention center.

23:30.719 --> 23:33.059
Then do we just leave him\Nas if nothing happened?

23:33.059 --> 23:34.390
A person was set on fire.

23:34.390 --> 23:36.329
There is no chance\Nthat we'll win.

23:38.289 --> 23:39.900
We can't always be in\Na winning fight.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.160
If we fight,\Nwe might sometimes win.

23:45.370 --> 23:46.900
If a detective gives up,

23:47.539 --> 23:49.170
it means\Nthe whole world gave up.

23:51.140 --> 23:54.239
We're the last resort for\Nthose who are troubled.

23:58.249 --> 23:59.579
Those who are troubled.

24:07.059 --> 24:10.059
(Taxi)

24:19.900 --> 24:21.600
Mom.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.739
Mom. No.

24:24.509 --> 24:26.539
That's my dad.

24:26.539 --> 24:29.479
Why are you not letting me\Ngo near him?

24:33.650 --> 24:35.049
This is so unlike you.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.920
It's not over\Nuntil it's over.

24:39.690 --> 24:40.719
Let's go.

24:46.090 --> 24:47.160
Come on.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.029
Come on, let's go.

24:57.210 --> 24:58.410
Won Jae.

24:59.509 --> 25:00.940
What you did was\Na science experiment...

25:00.940 --> 25:02.509
written in a textbook.

25:03.779 --> 25:04.880
A free fall experiment.

25:06.319 --> 25:08.420
When police officers\Nask you a question,

25:08.519 --> 25:10.819
that's what you'll say.\NGot it?

25:11.920 --> 25:14.090
There's no such thing\Nwritten in a textbook.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.690
Just listen to your\Nmom and dad. Okay?

25:20.229 --> 25:21.299
And...

25:22.430 --> 25:25.700
you have never set\Nanything else on fire.

25:26.299 --> 25:27.469
Never.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.670
But...

25:30.410 --> 25:31.910
why do we have to lie?

25:32.710 --> 25:34.079
If we don't,

25:34.079 --> 25:36.309
police officers might\Ncome and arrest you.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.680
I can't be\Nsent to prison...

25:38.680 --> 25:40.519
no matter what I do\Nbefore I turn 10.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.249
You're a lawyer.\NWhy don't you know that?

25:55.299 --> 25:56.469
Why don't we...

25:57.130 --> 25:59.600
let him stay with his aunt\Nin Canada for a while?

25:59.600 --> 26:02.539
He may not get punished,\Nbut he'll be questioned.

26:02.670 --> 26:04.739
Won Jae isn't\Ncriminally liable,

26:04.870 --> 26:06.710
but we have a civil\Nliability as his parents.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
Then we can give them\Na compensation.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.110
You never know\Nwhen the patient...

26:11.110 --> 26:12.979
will get better\Nfrom a serious burn.

26:13.079 --> 26:14.779
If they prove that\Nhe did it on purpose,

26:14.779 --> 26:15.950
we'll have to pay...

26:15.950 --> 26:18.289
a hefty amount as\Ntheir compensation.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.319
We must turn this\Ninto a mistake.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.829
How can they\Nnot even say sorry?

26:27.229 --> 26:29.259
It's as if\Nnothing has happened.

26:29.529 --> 26:31.729
If Won Jae was\Na year or two older,

26:31.729 --> 26:33.140
they probably\Ncouldn't do that.

26:34.069 --> 26:35.900
I'm sure they want to\Ncome to an agreement.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.269
They're afraid he'll go to\Na detention center.

26:39.039 --> 26:40.840
The kid can't be blamed\Nbecause he's young.

26:41.009 --> 26:43.180
The parents aren't blamed\Nbecause they didn't do it.

26:43.910 --> 26:46.779
Then are we to\Nblame the victim?

26:49.279 --> 26:50.920
Are you even chewing?

26:50.920 --> 26:52.690
Eat slowly.\NYou'll get sick.

26:53.719 --> 26:55.259
I have to eat\Nand get more energy...

26:55.259 --> 26:56.529
to fight them and win.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.789
It's great that\Nyou are so motivated.

26:59.930 --> 27:01.860
But why am I cutting\Nkimchi all by myself?

27:02.729 --> 27:04.130
You're sitting there\Njust eating them.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.700
I'm still hurt too.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.900
You're so cheap.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.769
Give it to me. I'll do it.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.180
You seemed kind of\Ncool just now,

27:15.180 --> 27:16.509
but no, you're just cheap.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.910
Did I look cool?

27:18.710 --> 27:20.120
I'll finish\Nwhat I started.

27:20.579 --> 27:23.120
I've done it often, so\NI have a way of doing it.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.489
These scissors are\Npretty sharp. Look.

27:25.620 --> 27:26.989
Great scissors.

27:28.789 --> 27:30.029
Eat up.

27:30.090 --> 27:31.860
(A child below\Nthe age of 10...)

27:31.860 --> 27:33.559
(will not be\Ntried in a court.)

27:39.999 --> 27:41.600
"Article Nine\Nof the Criminal Code".

27:42.170 --> 27:44.469
"Those that are\Nnot 14 years of age..."

27:44.469 --> 27:46.039
"will not be punished."

27:49.509 --> 27:51.509
"Rules of juvenile\Njudgment,"

27:51.910 --> 27:53.380
"Article 42".

27:55.519 --> 27:57.890
"A child below\Nthe age of 10..."

27:57.890 --> 28:00.890
"will not be\Ntried in a court."

28:04.890 --> 28:07.029
We can't apply\Nany of these laws.

28:09.259 --> 28:10.569
We can file\Na civil litigation.

28:10.630 --> 28:12.200
His parents are\Nobligated to compensate.

28:13.469 --> 28:16.610
A civil case takes a long\Ntime to get resolved.

28:19.809 --> 28:21.440
What if we punish him\Nper his school rules?

28:22.140 --> 28:24.180
Won Jae is a student\Nafter all.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.150
Think about it. We need\Nthe principal to agree...

28:26.150 --> 28:27.920
to gather a student\Ndisciplinary committee.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.249
Wouldn't he get\Nconscious about this?

28:29.249 --> 28:32.390
Won Jae's mom is a board\Nmember of the PTA.

28:32.450 --> 28:33.559
So what?

28:34.890 --> 28:36.559
Are you going to give up?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.729
If we give up,

28:39.729 --> 28:41.559
it means\Nthe whole world gave up.

28:46.029 --> 28:47.200
I won't.

28:49.299 --> 28:51.670
(Joongjin Police Station)

28:54.509 --> 28:57.279
This time, we can't\Nback down. Okay?

28:57.749 --> 28:59.009
If they try to\Nstop this investigation,

28:59.009 --> 29:00.450
I don't care if they're\Nmy manager or leader.

29:00.450 --> 29:02.479
I'm going to report them\Nto the inspectors.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.819
Yes, go and bite them.

29:05.190 --> 29:07.819
Don't worry about it, and\Nget to Won Jae's school.

29:07.819 --> 29:09.789
If the law can't help us,\Nthe school has to.

29:11.489 --> 29:12.630
Detective Ha.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.529
Keep it up.

29:16.930 --> 29:18.299
Make sure you apply\Nthe ointment often.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.140
If not, you'll end up\Ngetting a scar.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.749
Did I really\Nwitness the culprit?

29:36.989 --> 29:38.019
Yes.

29:42.759 --> 29:45.190
I stayed silent\Njust in case...

29:45.190 --> 29:46.559
he wasn't the culprit.

29:46.799 --> 29:48.729
I should've reported him.

29:48.729 --> 29:50.329
If I did,\Nthis wouldn't have...

29:50.329 --> 29:51.400
Even if you did,

29:52.700 --> 29:54.969
there is no way\Nwe could've stopped him.

29:55.539 --> 29:57.269
Is there anything\Nthat I can do?

29:58.410 --> 29:59.579
I'll do anything.

30:07.049 --> 30:08.420
- Manager Jo.\N- Where's my phone?

30:09.850 --> 30:11.950
Manager Jo. Manager Jo!

30:12.450 --> 30:13.989
- This time, I have to...\N- Wait.

30:13.989 --> 30:14.989
One second.

30:20.329 --> 30:21.960
Please take this case.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.029
You're the only one\Nwhom I can trust.

30:28.969 --> 30:31.309
It was a mistake to let\NMr. Gye take it.

30:31.569 --> 30:33.479
If I had given it to you,

30:33.479 --> 30:35.779
such a horrible incident\Nwouldn't have happened.

30:37.049 --> 30:38.779
I'm glad\Nyou realized that.

30:39.180 --> 30:41.749
Mr. Gye wanted to have\Na better performance,

30:41.749 --> 30:43.650
so he didn't do\Nmuch of an investigation.

30:44.390 --> 30:45.450
Manager Jo.

30:47.090 --> 30:49.789
How can you butcher\Nyour job like this?

30:49.989 --> 30:52.229
Stop bothering him,\Nand come here.

30:52.390 --> 30:54.759
No. Right now!

30:57.670 --> 30:58.930
You told me...

30:59.640 --> 31:01.999
to not get Wan Seung\Ninvolved in this.

31:03.969 --> 31:06.380
Okay, I get it.\NGrab a seat.

31:06.509 --> 31:08.009
Sit down.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.420
This is all for your sake.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.420
Pardon?

31:14.620 --> 31:17.650
Have some.\NThis is cat poop coffee.

31:20.289 --> 31:22.420
I mean, someone\Ngot hurt in this.

31:22.420 --> 31:23.930
We have to investigate.

31:23.930 --> 31:25.430
But what if we do?

31:25.430 --> 31:27.200
The kid's dad\Nis a successful lawyer.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.660
He's not just going to\Nsit around.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.200
No matter\Nhow hard you try,

31:30.200 --> 31:32.329
nothing good will\Ncome out of this case.

31:35.569 --> 31:38.309
You're Joongjin's\Nbest detective.

31:39.009 --> 31:41.610
You can't get a bad case\Non your resume.

32:01.559 --> 32:03.400
I can't do this anymore.

32:03.870 --> 32:05.799
Getting a blow\Nfrom here and there.

32:15.279 --> 32:16.279
Constable Shin.

32:16.910 --> 32:17.910
What's that?

32:18.650 --> 32:20.279
It's for my dry skin.

32:21.850 --> 32:23.650
Constable Shin.\NHow much is that?

32:23.650 --> 32:24.749
96 dollars.

32:24.749 --> 32:27.660
Oh, no. That's too much!

32:28.319 --> 32:30.690
You got ripped off\Nsince you paid over 80.

32:31.690 --> 32:33.229

32:33.229 --> 32:35.229
Use a coupon and get\Na credit card discount.

32:35.229 --> 32:36.700

It's okay.\NI used my dad's card.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.910
Gosh. Good job.

32:51.009 --> 32:53.950
By the way,\Nhow is your dad today?

32:54.519 --> 32:57.049
I don't know. I was\Nat a club last night.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.989
And I came\Nstraight to work.

32:58.989 --> 32:59.989
Gosh.

32:59.989 --> 33:01.890
I'll get wrinkles\Nif I get tired.

33:03.630 --> 33:04.630
Gosh.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.029
Who keeps calling me?\NWhat a nuisance.

33:10.870 --> 33:11.969
Yes, sir.

33:12.130 --> 33:13.569
Yes? Recording room?

33:13.799 --> 33:16.370
Okay. I'll be there\Nwith Constable Shin.

33:16.710 --> 33:18.710
Yes, sir.\NWe'll be right there.

33:20.110 --> 33:21.710
He's so bothersome.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.809
Let's go. I'll teach you\Nhow to record a statement.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.680
I've been\Nwanting to do that.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.019
But that's not as fun\Nas you think.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.130
Move.

33:38.529 --> 33:41.160
- Get out of my way.\N- Well...

33:42.360 --> 33:44.499
- Come on.\N- Constable Shin.

33:44.499 --> 33:45.969
Didn't you forget\Nto bring something?

33:46.370 --> 33:47.799
No.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.509
Yes, you did\Neven if you didn't.

33:55.239 --> 33:57.610
Can't you feel the dark\Nforce in this hallway?

33:58.049 --> 33:59.049
No.

33:59.279 --> 34:01.450
You should know it\Ninstinctively.

34:01.749 --> 34:02.749
Let's go.

34:02.749 --> 34:03.989
Get out of the way.

34:04.019 --> 34:06.319
You can't go in.

34:06.319 --> 34:07.660
- Gosh.\N- Hey.

34:07.660 --> 34:10.590
What are you guys doing\Nso early in the morning?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.998
People could\Nmisunderstand you.

34:13.228 --> 34:14.300
Well, I have...

34:14.659 --> 34:16.130
nothing against it though.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.570
Get him out of my sight.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.400
I'm picky about men.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.969
He's an eyesore.

34:22.670 --> 34:23.768
Leave him alone.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.010
- He's working hard.\N- What?

34:26.010 --> 34:29.110
We have no time to deal\Nwith a nine-year-old.

34:33.420 --> 34:34.748
Do whatever...

34:35.219 --> 34:36.219
you want.

34:36.690 --> 34:37.690
Do it well.

34:38.650 --> 34:39.659
What are you...

34:40.219 --> 34:41.219
Well...

34:45.559 --> 34:47.860
I see what he's doing.\NThat rat.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.829
He's bailing\Non this case...

34:49.829 --> 34:51.030
because\Nit's nothing but trouble.

34:53.969 --> 34:56.570
Fine. Thanks\Nfor not interfering.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.650
You already appointed\Na lawyer.

35:10.389 --> 35:11.720
I'm here as his guardian.

35:20.059 --> 35:23.199
I feel really bad...

35:23.199 --> 35:24.900
about what happened.

35:24.900 --> 35:26.070
So...

35:26.539 --> 35:27.670
please help.

35:28.070 --> 35:30.039
I have no authority.

35:30.409 --> 35:32.539
Please\Ntalk to the principal.

35:32.539 --> 35:33.539
You're...

35:34.210 --> 35:35.809
Ye Na's homeroom teacher.

35:35.809 --> 35:37.610
And also Won Jae's.

35:40.949 --> 35:41.979
You tried to set Genoise\Non fire...

35:41.979 --> 35:43.849
using acetone\Nand cigarette butt, right?

35:47.159 --> 35:48.559
He did not.

35:49.990 --> 35:52.729
You ordered quicklime\Nonline...

35:52.729 --> 35:54.059
and had it delivered...

35:54.059 --> 35:55.829
to Joongjin4-dong,\NDa-gil 56-2.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.199
You cut it\Nwith a cutter knife,

35:57.470 --> 35:58.800
then watched\Nthe place burn.

36:05.139 --> 36:06.510
He did not.

36:12.179 --> 36:15.220
I really feel bad, but...

36:15.220 --> 36:17.949
Her mom got severely hurt.

36:18.289 --> 36:20.519
If the school\Ndoesn't do anything,

36:21.119 --> 36:23.289
Ye Na will be very hurt.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.130
Both Ye Na and Won Jae...

36:25.130 --> 36:27.460
are my precious students.

36:27.729 --> 36:31.099
I have to think about\NWon Jae as well.

36:31.099 --> 36:32.229
I have to be fair.

36:33.539 --> 36:34.639
I mean...

36:35.900 --> 36:38.869
Are you saying\NYe Na's pain equals...

36:38.869 --> 36:42.280
that of the kid\Nwho set her mom on fire?

36:42.579 --> 36:45.479
How can you even\Ncall yourself a teacher?

36:45.909 --> 36:48.679
- Hee Yeon.\N- How can you say that...

36:49.949 --> 36:51.619
- Stop.\N- Let's go.

(Kim Won Jae, Seo Ye Na)

37:08.340 --> 37:10.010
Since your dad is\Nanswering for you,

37:10.639 --> 37:12.710
you must be a baby\Nthat can't do anything.

37:14.139 --> 37:15.579
Just say what's necessary.

37:18.909 --> 37:21.880
Sure. Won Jae doesn't know\Nanything anyway.

37:23.490 --> 37:25.749
Why did he go to\Nthe rental apartment?

37:26.150 --> 37:27.889
He went over\Nto his friend's place.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.460
That's Ye Na's place,\Nright?

37:29.460 --> 37:31.960
I hear Won Jae\Ngoes over there often.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.199
Yes, as far as I know.

37:35.199 --> 37:36.199
But...

37:36.829 --> 37:38.800
Ye Na never visited\Nthe pharmacy, right?

37:42.940 --> 37:43.940
Right?

37:46.409 --> 37:49.510
(Joongjin\NElementary School)

37:49.510 --> 37:51.650
I ruined it, didn't I?

37:53.050 --> 37:54.280
I should've held back.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.090
You didn't say\Nanything wrong though.

37:58.550 --> 37:59.590
But...

38:00.760 --> 38:02.019
what should we do now?

38:04.260 --> 38:06.699
I'll meet\Nwith the principal.

38:07.999 --> 38:08.999
Pardon?

38:09.599 --> 38:11.769
He avoids our calls.\NHe won't even see us.

38:11.769 --> 38:12.900
How?

38:13.740 --> 38:15.400
I used to make...

38:15.400 --> 38:17.470
special order cakes\Nin Cheongdam-dong.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.409
One of the clients...

38:19.409 --> 38:21.280
worked at the\NOffice of Education.

38:21.409 --> 38:22.979
I'm sure he'll help me.

38:29.550 --> 38:30.749
I heard...

38:31.619 --> 38:33.619
Ye Na hated Won Jae.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.229
But he went over to her\Nhouse and bothered her.

38:36.229 --> 38:37.389
That's not true.

38:38.590 --> 38:40.300
Everyone at school\Ntalked about...

38:40.530 --> 38:42.059
how Won Jae liked Ye Na.

38:42.130 --> 38:43.429
He kept\Nfollowing her around.

38:43.429 --> 38:44.729
I didn't.

38:44.729 --> 38:45.800
You even followed her\Nto her house...

38:45.800 --> 38:46.869
when she said\Nshe doesn't like you.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.809
No. I didn't go there\Nto play with her.

38:49.809 --> 38:50.909
Then why did you go there?

38:50.909 --> 38:53.079
Won Jae,\Ndon't listen to him.

39:04.119 --> 39:05.420
- What's that?\N- Dad.

39:05.619 --> 39:07.320
- Hello, Dad!\N- At ease.

39:11.429 --> 39:12.760
Why can't you answer me?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.130
I guess I was right.

39:14.559 --> 39:16.159
- You like Ye Na, right?\N- No.

39:16.159 --> 39:17.630
I went there to do\Na science experiment.

39:17.630 --> 39:18.670
Why that apartment then?

39:18.670 --> 39:20.699
Because the truck\Nwent into that block.

39:20.699 --> 39:22.039
Don't answer him!

39:22.400 --> 39:24.440
You wanted an experiment\Ndone on the truck.

39:24.970 --> 39:26.440
But you couldn't...

39:26.440 --> 39:27.809
because it was\Nleaving the block.

39:28.179 --> 39:29.679
You didn't want to leave\Nwithout getting it done.

39:29.679 --> 39:31.349
You didn't do it\Nwith a bad intention.

39:31.749 --> 39:33.150
You wouldn't have\Nthrown it at a person...

39:33.420 --> 39:35.249
if the truck\Nwas still there.

39:35.519 --> 39:36.519
Right?

39:37.650 --> 39:38.650
Right.

39:41.289 --> 39:42.619
So in the end,

39:43.229 --> 39:44.829
you did throw it\Nat a person.

40:00.710 --> 40:02.979
Amazing. He did it.

40:04.409 --> 40:05.979
Don't say that.

40:05.979 --> 40:08.579
Why not? He's on our side,\Nand he's doing well.

40:08.949 --> 40:12.249
I don't think he should be\Ndoing well.

40:12.749 --> 40:13.820
No.

40:14.090 --> 40:15.090
What?

40:15.860 --> 40:16.929
Gosh.

40:17.460 --> 40:18.659
Oh, well...

Let's stop here.

40:30.769 --> 40:31.840
Okay.

40:32.070 --> 40:33.780
You should go prepare\Nfor a trial.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.749
Won Jae just confessed\Nthat he did it on purpose.

40:37.380 --> 40:38.979
The compensation cost\Nwill increase a lot.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.349
Get up. Let's go.

40:49.119 --> 40:51.559
Bear the responsibility\Nwith him if you love him.

40:54.329 --> 40:56.499

41:09.340 --> 41:11.210

Good luck.

41:55.690 --> 41:57.860
and has good relationships\Nwith his friends.

41:58.590 --> 42:01.030

42:01.030 --> 42:02.400
and other matters\Ninto consideration,

42:06.740 --> 42:08.740
we've decided that Won Jae\Nand his parents...

42:09.300 --> 42:12.409
do volunteer service\Nat a hospital...

42:12.570 --> 42:15.340

42:15.409 --> 42:16.409
Look.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.349
There's nothing\Nhe can do there.

42:18.349 --> 42:19.720

42:19.720 --> 42:21.220
that the parents should\Ndo community services.

Please consider\Nthe school's reputation.

Mom. I don't want\Nto go there.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.470
Why is he suddenly\Nturning his back on us?

42:44.269 --> 42:45.740
Did you upset him\Nby any chance?

42:45.869 --> 42:48.380
I don't know. Gosh, why is\Nhe like this suddenly?

42:53.849 --> 42:56.550
We can't change\Nwhat's happened already.

42:56.550 --> 42:58.990
What do you gain\Nby hurting this child?

42:58.990 --> 43:02.059
Won Jae needs to learn how\Nto take responsibility.

43:02.559 --> 43:05.059
If you cover for him, he\Nmay commit a bigger crime.

43:05.059 --> 43:06.900
Don't treat him\Nlike a criminal.

43:06.900 --> 43:09.159
I won't settle it.

43:09.729 --> 43:11.429
Let's see the end of this.

43:11.429 --> 43:12.530
Do you...

43:13.139 --> 43:14.699
not feel apologetic\Nat least a bit?

43:14.699 --> 43:16.269
Everyone makes mistakes.

43:16.409 --> 43:17.710
He did it as a prank.

43:17.710 --> 43:20.479
Then you'll\Nforgive people...

43:20.479 --> 43:22.979
who make the same\Nmistake that Won Ja made.

43:22.979 --> 43:24.179
Is that\Nwhat you're saying?

43:24.179 --> 43:25.809
Are you cursing me now?

43:26.880 --> 43:27.920
Let's go.

43:34.289 --> 43:37.690
They think such things\Nwon't happen to them.

43:38.329 --> 43:39.559
Ye Na's mom...

43:40.059 --> 43:41.999
wouldn't have imagined it\Nhappening to her either.

43:55.579 --> 43:56.979
He confessed,\Nand it was discussed...

43:57.780 --> 43:59.449
in the student\Ndisciplinary committee.

44:00.220 --> 44:01.519
Everything is over now.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.820
There's nothing\Nmore we can do.

44:05.749 --> 44:06.960
Won Jae...

44:09.159 --> 44:10.929
Do you think he's\N100 percent the criminal?

44:12.130 --> 44:13.699
Evidence is everywhere...

44:13.699 --> 44:15.229
including his fingerprints\Nand marks.

44:15.229 --> 44:16.329
There's nothing more\Nto investigate.

44:16.329 --> 44:17.329
By any chance,

44:18.199 --> 44:19.900
did he do it\Nout of mistake?

44:28.240 --> 44:29.979
If it fell down\Nvertically,

44:30.650 --> 44:32.780
the firebomb must've\Nfallen to the flowerbed.

44:35.179 --> 44:37.320
It couldn't have\Nhit her...

44:37.990 --> 44:39.619
if he hadn't targeted her.

44:39.789 --> 44:41.820
It's fortunate...

44:42.090 --> 44:43.490
that it didn't\Nhit her directly.

44:44.059 --> 44:47.360
I'm dispirited that\NI'm trying so hard...

44:48.659 --> 44:49.970
to punish\Na nine-year-old child.

44:51.929 --> 44:53.840
I rather hope that\Nit was a mistake.

44:59.610 --> 45:01.280
Looking down from here,

45:01.479 --> 45:03.949
people seem so small\Nlike ants.

45:05.179 --> 45:08.150
That must be why Won Jae\Ndidn't feel guilty.

45:09.949 --> 45:12.019
He would've\Nbeen able to see...

45:12.650 --> 45:16.059
her scream, cries,\Nand pain from up close.

45:18.860 --> 45:20.599
With or without\Nmy eyes closed,

45:21.729 --> 45:23.530
I could feel her pain.

45:25.369 --> 45:27.240
Even if they\Ncompensate her,

45:29.099 --> 45:31.610
money can't heal\Nwhat she has suffered.

45:32.269 --> 45:33.679
It was only a prank\Nof a child,

45:34.809 --> 45:36.579
but the result is\Nso horrible.

45:37.409 --> 45:40.320
But no one is willing\Nto be responsible for it.

45:41.979 --> 45:43.420
That's what's\Nmore horrible.

45:59.429 --> 46:00.999
10 days of volunteer\Nservice will pass quickly.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.940
Hang on a little\Nand do it with Won Jae.

46:03.610 --> 46:04.639
What about you?

46:05.369 --> 46:06.679
Am I his only parent?

46:06.740 --> 46:08.510
Why do you always sneak\Nout of things like this?

46:08.510 --> 46:10.550
Ye Na's mom is a woman.

46:10.550 --> 46:11.880
I can't nurse her,

46:11.880 --> 46:13.780
feed her, put clothes on\Nher, and wash her myself.

46:16.949 --> 46:18.749
- Let's go.\N- Okay.

46:35.269 --> 46:37.170
I'll do it alone.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.309
So just do\Nyour homework, okay?

46:51.289 --> 46:54.119
If you do that,\Nthe patient will be hurt.

46:56.190 --> 47:00.400
It must be much more\Npainful than giving birth.

47:04.229 --> 47:05.429
Ye Na.

47:06.130 --> 47:08.369
Your daughter is well.

47:24.389 --> 47:25.519
Ye Na.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.860
I'm waiting for my mom's\Nvolunteer service to end.

47:30.289 --> 47:31.329
What about you?

47:32.960 --> 47:35.059
I came here to see my mom.

47:36.429 --> 47:39.170
My mom is over there.

47:40.869 --> 47:43.369
But why aren't\Nyou going in?

47:43.740 --> 47:45.039
I'm scared.

47:46.170 --> 47:48.010
I'm scared...

47:50.010 --> 47:51.449
to see my mom's face.

47:52.010 --> 47:54.349
Then let's hang out\Nhere with me.

47:54.550 --> 47:56.449
My mom made me snacks too.

48:33.320 --> 48:34.559
- Mom!\N- Ye Na.

48:35.860 --> 48:37.130
You're scaring me.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.900
Ye Na!

48:44.070 --> 48:45.170
Goodness.

48:52.170 --> 48:53.240
Ye Na.

48:53.579 --> 48:56.679
It's okay.

48:56.849 --> 48:59.449
It's okay.

48:59.749 --> 49:02.449
It's okay.

49:12.190 --> 49:13.260
Are you sick?

49:14.530 --> 49:16.970
The woman whom\Nyou nurse every day.

49:17.829 --> 49:19.229
The woman\Nwith a creepy face...

49:19.869 --> 49:21.940
who cries every day.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.170
You can't say that.

49:24.639 --> 49:26.940
She's not creepy.\NShe's hurt.

49:26.940 --> 49:28.679
Is she hurt...

49:29.579 --> 49:31.479
because of me?

49:33.920 --> 49:36.179
Who said that?\NIt was only a mistake.

49:36.179 --> 49:37.550
That woman...

49:38.449 --> 49:39.990
is Ye Na's mom.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.559
Ye Na used to smile\Nwhenever she saw me.

49:45.190 --> 49:47.260
She used to\Nmake jokes often.

49:47.929 --> 49:49.059
But now,

49:49.460 --> 49:52.030
I want to grow up soon...

49:52.199 --> 49:53.369
so that I can\Ntake revenge...

49:53.369 --> 49:55.869
on the person who threw\Nthe firebomb at my mom.

49:59.170 --> 50:00.880
What should I do...

50:01.380 --> 50:03.479
if she finds out\Nthat I did it?

50:04.550 --> 50:06.280
What if she doesn't talk\Nto me ever again?

50:07.679 --> 50:09.179
What if she hates me?

50:10.920 --> 50:12.550
What if she\Nbecomes an adult...

50:13.119 --> 50:15.220
and doesn't forgive me?

50:16.289 --> 50:19.030
Mom, I...

50:20.059 --> 50:22.099
I'm so scared.

50:44.619 --> 50:45.690
Ye Na.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.059
Your mom...

50:50.389 --> 50:52.190
might not be\Nable to hug you...

50:54.760 --> 50:56.059
because she's hurt.

51:12.510 --> 51:15.579
I thought the service\Nperiod ended.

51:16.179 --> 51:18.150
I know. What's going on?

51:21.789 --> 51:23.559
Do it gently.

51:24.090 --> 51:26.329
You're not doing it\Nany better than Won Jae.

51:27.030 --> 51:28.530
Burn patients suffer\Nas much as labor pains...

51:28.530 --> 51:30.769
when something\Ngrazes their burned skin.

51:33.199 --> 51:34.400
Okay.

51:44.079 --> 51:45.679
Mom!

51:57.030 --> 51:59.260
Mom.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.409
Mom.

52:12.269 --> 52:15.639
Mom.

52:25.550 --> 52:28.119
Move the vase\Na bit to the right.

52:28.860 --> 52:31.130
And the napkin case\Nto the left.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.630
That's it. That's right.

52:33.999 --> 52:35.300
It looks much better.

52:35.300 --> 52:37.970
You have such\Na great sense with this.

52:40.170 --> 52:41.199
Can you bring...

52:41.470 --> 52:44.539
a vase that's\Na bit simpler than this?

52:44.869 --> 52:46.679
And when you order\Nthe tablecloth,

52:46.679 --> 52:48.479
make sure it's\Na little brighter.

52:48.710 --> 52:49.710
Okay.

52:58.690 --> 53:00.389
We open tomorrow...

53:01.059 --> 53:02.119
Seol Ok.

53:05.860 --> 53:07.260
Congratulations\Non opening this franchise.

53:07.460 --> 53:09.769
Goodness,\Nthis is so pretty.

53:10.530 --> 53:11.829
Thank you.

53:11.829 --> 53:14.440
I should put this\Nwhere I can see it well.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.409
How often\Ndo I have to water this?

53:21.380 --> 53:22.380
Hello.

53:30.820 --> 53:32.090
Once a week.

53:32.190 --> 53:34.360
Make sure it's\Nsoaked to its roots.

53:35.690 --> 53:38.059
Didn't you bring\Nany housewarming gifts?

53:39.159 --> 53:41.530
I thought I'm supposed to\Nget one from her.

53:43.229 --> 53:44.429
This way, please.

53:44.499 --> 53:45.800
I'll give you something.

53:59.349 --> 54:00.479
A community service\Ndepartment...

54:00.479 --> 54:02.920
of a law firm will\Nhelp Ye Na and her mom.

54:03.389 --> 54:06.320
There wasn't much budget\Nfrom the police,

54:06.320 --> 54:09.260
so Detective Ha went out\Nof his way to look.

54:09.729 --> 54:10.990
That's great news.

54:11.260 --> 54:13.229
Detective Ha,\NI'd like to thank you too.

54:14.130 --> 54:15.329
Thankfully,

54:15.329 --> 54:17.369
Ye Na's mom\Nregained consciousness.

54:23.369 --> 54:24.440
Thank you.

54:24.840 --> 54:26.010
Ms. Yoo.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.079
Thank you.

54:34.619 --> 54:37.990
I wanted you to be\Nthe first one to know.

54:38.990 --> 54:40.090
You didn't come here\Nto tell her that.

54:40.090 --> 54:41.619
You're just\Nmunching on her cake.

54:45.530 --> 54:46.829
What about this one?

54:48.599 --> 54:50.329
- This looks good.\N- Okay.

55:05.179 --> 55:06.920
I've seen her somewhere.

55:07.119 --> 55:08.619
I have something to do.

55:08.619 --> 55:09.619
Please excuse me.

55:09.619 --> 55:10.749
Where are you going?

55:10.749 --> 55:13.659
Do I have to report\Nevery single thing to you?

55:13.659 --> 55:15.190
I'm not curious.

55:15.190 --> 55:16.929
It's just manners to ask.

55:16.929 --> 55:17.929
Keep eating.

55:29.039 --> 55:30.340
It's very simple.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.409
Good.

55:33.179 --> 55:35.979
It's for a better image\Nfor Ha and Jung Law Firm.

55:37.050 --> 55:39.249
I'll continue to build\Nthis place with integrity.

55:40.119 --> 55:41.119
Okay.

55:44.289 --> 55:46.190
We said we'll decline\Nany flower gifts.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.490
Who sent this?

55:51.030 --> 55:53.229
(Mr. Kim)

55:53.229 --> 55:54.630
Mr. Kim?

55:56.030 --> 55:58.570
He's been tricking us\Nbehind Jung Ji Won.

55:58.800 --> 56:00.300
How dare he send flowers?

56:00.869 --> 56:02.340
Is he your acquaintance?

56:02.340 --> 56:03.869
I know him a little.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.210
When we grow weaker,

56:06.409 --> 56:09.849
he'll be the first\Nto bite our neck.

56:11.809 --> 56:12.880
Dad.

56:14.550 --> 56:16.289
We've been through a lot,

56:16.289 --> 56:18.820
but Ha and Jung Law Firm\Nisn't that weak.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.460
I'll make sure\NI lead it well.

56:23.389 --> 56:25.929
I should have\Nheld out a little longer.

56:27.030 --> 56:28.729
- Let's go inside.\N- Okay.

56:30.300 --> 56:31.599
The president is here.

56:50.119 --> 56:52.490
(President Ha Ji Seung's\NInaugural Ceremony)

56:54.389 --> 56:55.820
The flowers\Nwere delivered.

56:57.090 --> 56:58.889
His entire family\Nhave made it.

56:59.699 --> 57:03.070
It doesn't look like\Nhis health is failing.

57:06.999 --> 57:09.440
It's better to use\Na spoon to eat this.

57:10.610 --> 57:12.269
Thank you.

57:20.519 --> 57:21.679
This is so good.

57:21.679 --> 57:22.749
Really?

57:24.619 --> 57:26.559
Are you two dating...

57:27.389 --> 57:29.389
by any chance?

57:34.929 --> 57:36.670
Gosh, you are\Nruining the cake.

57:37.229 --> 57:38.670
Never.

57:39.970 --> 57:43.039
Then is Detective Ha\Ndating anyone?

57:45.170 --> 57:46.479
I don't think so.

57:48.710 --> 57:51.050
Where is he\Nstaying right now?

57:51.610 --> 57:52.710
It looked like\Nhe's staying elsewhere...

57:52.710 --> 57:54.519
because his house\Ncaught on fire.

57:54.519 --> 57:55.749
Do you know where\Nhe's staying?

57:56.389 --> 57:58.090
How would I know?

57:58.090 --> 57:59.389
We aren't that close.

58:01.289 --> 58:02.789
I have to go.

58:02.789 --> 58:04.059
You should finish this.

58:04.159 --> 58:05.460
I'm fine.

58:08.599 --> 58:09.599
Right.

58:09.900 --> 58:13.070
I gave up on working as\Nan honorary officer.

58:13.470 --> 58:14.800
All of a sudden? Why?

58:15.869 --> 58:17.369
An honorary officer was...

58:17.369 --> 58:19.610
literally just an honor.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.139
There was no power\Nwith the title.

58:21.679 --> 58:23.749
I can't call myself\Nan officer...

58:23.749 --> 58:25.110
if I can't even\Nget into the station.

58:26.780 --> 58:30.220
I haven't looked after\Nmy lunch box shop,

58:31.019 --> 58:33.019
so I'll go and\Nclean up the place.

58:50.340 --> 58:52.340
Are you using\NFrench gourmet butter?

58:52.570 --> 58:54.280
- And so much?\N- Yes.

58:56.409 --> 58:58.610
I'm expecting\Na very special guest.

58:59.949 --> 59:01.749
You can go to\Nthe third franchise,

59:01.749 --> 59:03.949
check the inventory,\Nand go home.

59:03.990 --> 59:04.990
Okay.

59:04.990 --> 59:07.360
I'm expecting\Na part-timer tomorrow,

59:08.490 --> 59:10.460
so you don't have to\Nworry about this shop.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Okay.

59:15.329 --> 59:18.229
I heard you met\Nwith the principal.

59:18.599 --> 59:19.599
Yes.

59:20.269 --> 59:22.840
The principal\Nwas very nice.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.110
But...

59:29.380 --> 59:30.579
because it was\Nthe first time,

59:30.849 --> 59:33.249
it looked like he couldn't\Nget used to my cake.

59:34.519 --> 59:36.220
He was a little shocked.

01:00:02.579 --> 01:00:04.349
Please don't turn it down.\NTake it.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.550
It's a way of\Nexpressing my gratitude.

01:00:07.579 --> 01:00:08.650
But...

01:00:09.849 --> 01:00:12.820
I'm not sure\Nif you will...

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.119
like this cake.

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.519
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:00:45.519 --> 01:00:47.690
Noryang-dong's\Ngeneral class.

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:50.030
I should've studied\Nat a place like this.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.729
I have to make\Ntop 100 today.

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:55.729
What? A murder case?

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:57.470
Yes, I'll be right there.

01:00:59.099 --> 01:01:00.099
Ms. Yoo?

01:01:00.099 --> 01:01:02.199
You're under arrest for\Nmurdering Lee Gwang Sik.

01:01:02.199 --> 01:01:03.610
Yes, this is weird.

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:06.110
Yoo Mi Joo may\Nnot be the murderer.

01:01:06.479 --> 01:01:08.280
I came to get\Ninformation about someone.

01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:10.510
You know him very well.

01:01:10.749 --> 01:01:12.010
Lieutenant Ha Wan Seung.
