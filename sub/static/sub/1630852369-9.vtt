on a lot growing up.

I went to law school.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.498

22:14.500 --> 22:18.102
'cause I just needed
to prove that I was worthy.

abandoned, or--I get it.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.906
- Can you just--

41:16.974 --> 41:19.108
- Yeah.
I hear you, yes.

41:19.176 --> 41:21.578
- Ryne and I are completely
misunderstanding each other.

41:21.645 --> 41:25.114
- It can be challenging
to communicate with Jennifer

41:25.182 --> 41:27.584
'cause she's--
She's go, go, go, go, go.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.852
- And I wish that
Ryne was more supportive.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.722
- It's "The Jenny Show."
It's "give me attention."

41:32.789 --> 41:35.725
- I'm living with this person
and I can't even relate to him.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.126
Like, we can't talk about it.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.796
- Can we not talk about this?
I'd rather not talk about this.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.064
- What?
- All of this.

41:41.131 --> 41:43.599
- What?
- We'll do this another time.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.767
- I just don't want you
to shut down.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.736
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Why can't we just continue--

41:46.803 --> 41:49.071
- I'd just rather not
do it right now.

41:49.139 --> 41:51.941
I'd just rather not.
- Why?

41:52.009 --> 41:57.547
- 'Cause I'd rather not, and
that's the final answer, okay?

41:57.549 --> 41:58.916
So I'm gonna go take a break...
- Okay.

41:58.982 --> 41:59.982
- And I'll go give the dog back.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.184
- Why?
- Just--that's enough.

42:18.101 --> 42:19.969

42:20.037 --> 42:21.704

I'll just go take a walk.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.640
I'll just go walk for a while.

taking my lesbian flag down.

42:44.095 --> 42:45.127
- Why?

42:45.195 --> 42:47.864

the other day on TikTok.

42:47.866 --> 42:48.931
- Yeah.
- On--

42:48.999 --> 42:51.535
- You can comment on TikTok?
- What?

42:51.602 --> 42:56.138
- Do you get jealous of Gina's
relationship with Heather?

42:56.206 --> 42:58.075
Like, the fact, like, they're
going to New York together

42:58.141 --> 42:59.876
or anything, like,
does that bother you?

42:59.878 --> 43:02.078
- I'm ----ing reeling right now.

43:02.145 --> 43:03.879
I'm thinking about
you and Gina all the time.

43:03.947 --> 43:05.748
- Ryne packed his bags
and left last night.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.083
- What?
- Holy sh--.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.752
- I just stopped crying
for 13 hours.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.888
- I was served
with divorce papers.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.023
- I know.
You said that many times.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.224
- Apparently, I'm not allowed
to talk about my divorce.

43:15.292 --> 43:17.827
I'm not allowed to--
- It's all you talk about!

43:17.895 --> 43:19.262
What are you talking about?
