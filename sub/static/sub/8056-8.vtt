WEBVTT

00:00.539 --> 00:01.338
Tom!

00:01.339 --> 00:04.873
I would like you to redesign
our Parks department logo.

00:04.941 --> 00:06.208
Sounds cool so far.

00:06.776 --> 00:09.878
Rethink our visual brand,
take these words,

00:09.946 --> 00:12.547
and make
something amazing.

00:12.615 --> 00:14.249
So you're saying you want me
to choose a new font?

00:14.317 --> 00:16.617
Yes, essentially I'd like
you to choose a new font.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.185
Jerry, I am making you
my number-two guy

00:18.753 --> 00:19.753
on the new font project.

00:19.821 --> 00:21.989
Come on, that's too close.
Let's make him a number-three.

00:22.057 --> 00:23.357
Fair enough.
Jerry, you're number three.

00:23.425 --> 00:25.293
There's only two of us.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.529
He has been
in this department a long time.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.131
I think maybe you could
learn somethg from him.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:59.159 --> 01:01.460
Our research shows
that our park

01:01.527 --> 01:03.862
will draw
5,000 visitors a year,

01:03.930 --> 01:06.998
and I want this to be
the most amazing, awe-inspiring,

01:07.066 --> 01:08.666
fun-filled park
ever conceived.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.234
Now how big
is the park, exactly?

01:10.302 --> 01:15.573
It is .000003

01:15.640 --> 01:16.941
square miles.

01:17.009 --> 01:18.943
Recently, the last remaining
telephone booths

01:19.011 --> 01:20.610
in Pawnee were torn down,

01:20.678 --> 01:21.979
and on that
patch of concrete,

01:22.046 --> 01:24.614
I am creating Pawnee's
newest tourist attraction$$$

01:24.682 --> 01:26.749
The smallest park
in Indiana.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.251
The title
is currently held

01:28.319 --> 01:30.187
by Martin Luther King, Jr. Park
in Terryville,

01:30.254 --> 01:31.588
but guess what?

01:31.655 --> 01:35.359
Terryville sucks old car tires,
and so does Martin Luther--

01:35.426 --> 01:38.327
No, he does not
suck old car tires.

01:38.395 --> 01:40.296
He was one of
the greatest men in history.

01:40.364 --> 01:43.765
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get competitive.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.102
Has there been any resistance
from the community?

01:46.169 --> 01:47.303
No, not at all.

01:47.371 --> 01:48.637
It's so small
we don't even need to do

01:48.705 --> 01:50.406
an environmental impact report.

01:50.474 --> 01:53.241
It's inexpensive,
it benefits the town,

01:53.309 --> 01:54.709
it's a total slam dunk.

01:54.776 --> 01:56.811
You two, when you work
on a project together,

01:56.879 --> 01:58.946
are simply amazing.

01:59.015 --> 02:00.815
Great job, team.

02:00.883 --> 02:02.484
Man, all these classes
look amazing.

02:02.951 --> 02:03.985
I can't choose.

02:04.053 --> 02:05.620
They do this thing
called a "shopping period,"

02:05.687 --> 02:07.555
where you can just sample
as many classes as you want.

02:07.623 --> 02:08.822
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.289
Sports and Society.

02:10.358 --> 02:12.692
Physical Science.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.161
A crash course?

02:14.229 --> 02:15.629
Yeah, but it's not
what you think.

02:15.696 --> 02:17.531
Oh.

02:17.598 --> 02:20.034
I did not graduate college,
because I did not "attend" it,

02:20.101 --> 02:21.701
but I'm trying
to improve myself,

02:21.769 --> 02:24.570
so I'm gonna start
by taking just one class.

02:24.638 --> 02:25.938
If you're gonna
take a college course,

02:26.006 --> 02:28.007
Andrew, you should
explore a new subject.

02:28.599 --> 02:30.576
- Broaden your horizons.
- Yup.

02:30.644 --> 02:32.078
Horizons are dumb.
Never broaden your horizons.

02:32.146 --> 02:33.546
Yup.

02:33.613 --> 02:35.314
Just take something you're
great at and get an easy "A".

02:35.382 --> 02:39.419
No offense, Ron, but April's
way sounds way easier.

02:39.486 --> 02:42.220
Guitar for beginners.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.221
I value a good education,

02:43.289 --> 02:44.456
so I don't want
to see Andy

02:44.524 --> 02:46.724
waste his time in college.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.428
Of all my coworkers,
he is one of a small number

02:49.495 --> 02:51.430
whom I do not
actively root against.

02:52.497 --> 02:55.700
Ugh, there I go
getting all sappy.

02:57.934 --> 02:59.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:59.371 --> 03:01.638
So, I have about nine things
I need to talk to you about.

03:01.706 --> 03:03.240
The first is
the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.975
Do you know who's
bringing scissors?

03:05.043 --> 03:07.478
Because I cannot tell you
how many ceremonies get derailed

03:07.546 --> 03:08.845
when people don't
bring scissors.

03:08.913 --> 03:10.147
- Number two--
- Right. Um, listen.

03:10.215 --> 03:11.348
I'm actually
glad you're here.

03:11.416 --> 03:12.549
Oh, yeah?

03:12.616 --> 03:13.916
After
this project finishes,

03:13.984 --> 03:15.452
I'm gonna focus
on other departments

03:15.519 --> 03:17.454
and cut down my time
with Parks and Rec.

03:17.521 --> 03:18.955
What?

03:19.522 --> 03:22.358
Well, look, I mean,
we tried hanging out together,

03:22.426 --> 03:26.296
we tried working together,
and it just...

03:26.363 --> 03:27.630
Bums me out.

03:27.698 --> 03:29.831
No, no, no. We're just
working out the kinks.

03:29.899 --> 03:31.666
You don't need
to decrease your time with me.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.668
In fact, you need
to increase your time with me.

03:33.736 --> 03:35.571
You need to spend
more time with me.

03:35.638 --> 03:36.871
That make sense?
I think it does.

03:36.939 --> 03:38.207
No, Leslie,
no, listen to me.

03:38.274 --> 03:40.409
After <i>The Smallest Park</i>
wraps up,

03:40.477 --> 03:41.710
I am going to ask Chris

03:41.777 --> 03:44.545
to take over
all Parks and Rec business.

03:44.613 --> 03:47.215
Okay?

03:47.782 --> 03:49.317
- Okay.
- All right.

03:49.384 --> 03:50.784
Well,
if you'll excuse me,

03:50.852 --> 03:52.786
I need to ascertain
the whereabouts

03:52.854 --> 03:56.090
of some oversized
ceremonial scissors.

03:56.158 --> 03:57.592
I--

03:57.659 --> 04:01.694
Those are
my pens and pencils.

04:01.762 --> 04:05.265
No, see, I think that
Comic Sans always screams "fun."

04:05.333 --> 04:06.266
Right?

04:06.334 --> 04:08.568
But, man,
those "r"s in Helvetica,

04:08.636 --> 04:10.069
they're just, you know, like,
really popping for me.

04:10.138 --> 04:12.339
I've never been more bored
in my entire life.

04:12.406 --> 04:13.806
Who cares about letters?

04:13.874 --> 04:15.875
The only good font
is the <i>Sopranos</i> one,

04:15.943 --> 04:17.243
where the "r" is a pistol.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.310
Let's think bigger,
people, come on.

04:19.379 --> 04:21.213
What about
a top-to-bottom makeover

04:21.281 --> 04:22.848
for the entire department?

04:22.915 --> 04:25.784
I'm talking new uniforms,
new signage, new color scheme.

04:25.852 --> 04:27.319
A whole, new, sexy vibe.

04:27.387 --> 04:28.521
I don't know.

04:28.588 --> 04:29.821
This really isn't what Chris
asked us to do.

04:29.889 --> 04:32.024
You know, maybe we should just
stick to the assignment.

04:32.091 --> 04:33.191
Cool, Jerry.

04:33.259 --> 04:34.425
I'd take your advice
if I wanted to be

04:34.493 --> 04:37.028
a dead-eyed government drone
with no ambition.

04:37.095 --> 04:39.364
Yes, technically my new job
is my old job,

04:39.431 --> 04:42.333
but I'm not some boring,
Jerry Gergich-type guy.

04:42.401 --> 04:43.934
I'm more of a Steve Harvey.

04:44.002 --> 04:48.805
I dream big, I shake things up,
and I always wear dope suits.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.276
Okay, can anyone tell me
what this is called?

04:52.343 --> 04:53.443
- Uh, that's a fret.
- Yeah.

04:53.511 --> 04:55.145
And that little thing
you got right there--

04:55.213 --> 04:58.182
that's called a capo.
Changes the key.

04:58.249 --> 04:59.983
Uh, maybe you should be
in the advanced class?

05:00.051 --> 05:01.718
Yeah, maybe I should.

05:01.786 --> 05:03.487
Dude, dumb it down.

05:03.555 --> 05:07.122
But I couldn't possibly,
because I'm just a beginner.

05:07.191 --> 05:10.859
I barely haven't even
ever seen a "gortar."

05:10.927 --> 05:13.529
Okay.

05:13.597 --> 05:15.898
We will be working on basic
chords for the first four weeks.

05:15.965 --> 05:18.201
Oh, my God.
Four weeks.

05:18.268 --> 05:20.135
I'm already bored.

05:20.203 --> 05:22.404
Of course you are.
You're not challenging yourself.

05:22.471 --> 05:24.906
I suggest we sample
a few more classes.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.374
Fine.

05:26.442 --> 05:27.709
Very good.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.581
Good-bye, everybody.
Guess what.

05:32.648 --> 05:35.383
I was secretly an undercover
rock star this whole time.

05:37.686 --> 05:38.852
For what it's worth,

05:38.920 --> 05:41.655
I think you would make
an incredible brunette.

05:41.723 --> 05:45.593
Ron Swanson.

05:45.660 --> 05:47.461
I mean,
he's not even attending

05:47.529 --> 05:50.231
the ribbon-cutting ceremony
of a park that we made together.

05:50.298 --> 05:51.699
I'm sorry, Leslie.

05:51.766 --> 05:53.333
I'm just freaking out.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.501
The only thing
we have left is work.

05:55.569 --> 05:57.870
And now he doesn't want
to work together anymore?

05:57.938 --> 05:59.339
What does that all mean?

05:59.906 --> 06:01.807
I think you know what it means.

06:01.875 --> 06:04.744
Yeah.

06:04.811 --> 06:06.479
I should just drag out
that tiny park project

06:06.547 --> 06:07.547
for as long as possible

06:07.615 --> 06:08.913
so Ben and I can
keep working together.

06:08.981 --> 06:11.250
That's almost exactly
the opposite of what I meant.

06:11.317 --> 06:13.418
No, what I'll do is I'll get
the neighborhood all riled up,

06:13.486 --> 06:16.388
and then maybe they'll ask for
an environmental impact report--

06:16.456 --> 06:17.689
and then Ben and I
will work together

06:17.757 --> 06:18.957
for at least another year.

06:19.024 --> 06:20.191
- Leslie, for God's sakes.
- Good idea, Ann.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.293
No, Ann, please,
I beg of you.

06:21.361 --> 06:22.728
Will you just shut
your beautiful pie hole?

06:22.795 --> 06:25.263
Just sit there,
let me stare at you

06:26.030 --> 06:27.965
while you silently support me
on this game plan.

06:27.966 --> 06:28.966
- Leslie--
- Shh--

06:29.033 --> 06:30.501
- Ann...
- Leslie...

06:30.569 --> 06:32.336
Your quiet support
means the world to me.

06:32.404 --> 06:35.740
As well as your tacit
endorsement of all my behaviors.

06:35.807 --> 06:37.441
As a mature,
reasonable adult,

06:37.509 --> 06:39.377
I understand that
this will be the last project

06:39.444 --> 06:41.411
that Ben and I
are working on together.

06:41.479 --> 06:43.747
So please join us
for the grand opening

06:43.814 --> 06:47.917
of Pawnee's Smallest Park
on November 12th, 2070.

06:49.913 --> 06:51.912
Thank you for coming
to this very important

06:51.913 --> 06:55.149
and what I suspect
will be lengthy, meeting.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.985
The proposed park
is very small,

06:58.053 --> 07:00.619
but we believe we need
to investigate every detail.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.089
So if anyone
has any questions for me

07:03.157 --> 07:07.326
or assistant city manager
Ben Wyatt, go right ahead.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.327
Hi, I have a question
about this project.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.328
Whoa, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.963
Where's the fire?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.332
Let's get to know
each other first.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.000
Tell me
about your childhood.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.102
Is there going to be
basketball there?

07:17.170 --> 07:21.573
Basketball courts attract
undesirables to my community.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.708
Well, there's barely room
for an actual basketball,

07:23.776 --> 07:25.043
much less a court.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.546
Because there's
a definite type of person

07:27.613 --> 07:29.514
I associate
with basketball,

07:29.582 --> 07:31.849
and I'd rather not have
that type of person nearby.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.117
Don't worry.
You don't need to worry.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.119
Okay, I'll just
come right out and say it.

07:35.187 --> 07:36.921
I'll tell you what type
of person I don't like.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.056
You don't have to do that.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.691
No, no, no, no.
I think we get it.

07:39.758 --> 07:40.925
Yeah, we do, Rose,

07:40.993 --> 07:42.594
and you bring up
a very good point.

07:42.661 --> 07:45.262
Intolerance.
Can we be doing more?

07:45.330 --> 07:47.098
I'd like to hear
from each and every one of you

07:47.165 --> 07:49.900
about a time when prejudice
has touched your lives.

07:49.968 --> 07:51.234
Hello, everyone.

07:51.302 --> 07:52.903
My name
is Professor Barnes.

07:52.971 --> 07:54.838
The class I'll be
teaching this semester

07:54.906 --> 07:56.406
is introduction to lasers.

07:56.474 --> 07:59.275
The word "laser"
stands for

07:59.343 --> 08:00.343
light amplification

08:00.411 --> 08:03.113
by stimulated emission
of radiation.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.880
Where are the lasers?

08:04.948 --> 08:07.917
This graphic here represents
the electromagnetic spectrum

08:07.985 --> 08:09.251
arranged
from low frequency...

08:09.319 --> 08:11.420
He's not even
using a laser pointer.

08:11.488 --> 08:12.922
He's right.
This class stinks.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.157
Stick with it.
You might learn something.

08:15.225 --> 08:16.225
Uh, excuse me.

08:16.292 --> 08:17.760
Professor?

08:17.828 --> 08:19.428
Hi, there.
Andy Dwyer. Curious.

08:19.496 --> 08:22.396
When will you be bringing out
the lasers for me to play with?

08:22.464 --> 08:24.365
And will we start
with the small lasers,

08:24.433 --> 08:26.334
or could we go
just straight to the big lasers,

08:26.401 --> 08:27.936
in terms of
playing with them?

08:28.004 --> 08:29.971
We won't be using
actual lasers in this course.

08:30.039 --> 08:33.508
It's about the theory
that makes them possible.

08:33.575 --> 08:38.145
One of the most significant
bummers of my lifetime.

08:38.212 --> 08:40.080
First up,
a personal favorite,

08:40.148 --> 08:42.082
the <i>Sopranos</i> option.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.484
Now, I guarantee you,
anyone that sees this logo

08:44.552 --> 08:47.087
is not gonna
"fugghedaboudit."

08:47.955 --> 08:49.656
This is our current
community center.

08:49.723 --> 08:50.624
Ugh.

08:50.692 --> 08:52.825
This is our new
community center!

08:52.893 --> 08:55.427
That's right,
it looks like an apple store.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.063
Today, I'm a Beverly hills
plastic surgeon,

08:57.131 --> 08:59.265
and the Parks department
is a wrinkly old housewife

08:59.332 --> 09:00.900
in her early 30s.

09:00.968 --> 09:02.869
I'm about to work
a miracle.

09:02.936 --> 09:04.537
Thank you, ma'am.
What a story.

09:04.604 --> 09:05.805
Anyone else?

09:05.873 --> 09:07.373
Anyone...

09:07.440 --> 09:09.007
Uh, this gentleman
wants to say something.

09:09.075 --> 09:10.508
No, I don't.

09:10.576 --> 09:12.811
Come on, Mel. You're always
up in arms about something.

09:12.879 --> 09:14.046
No, I'm not.

09:14.113 --> 09:15.781
I'm not always
up in arms about something.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.215
There we go.
That's the spirit.

09:17.283 --> 09:18.483
Talk to me
about what's bothering you.

09:18.551 --> 09:22.154
Okay, that'll do it.
Thanks, everybody.

09:22.221 --> 09:23.954
I once hosted a forum
about a new bike rack

09:24.022 --> 09:25.455
that lasted seven hours.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.792
Now when I need
these people to complain,

09:27.859 --> 09:29.694
they're done
in 45 minutes?

09:31.161 --> 09:31.995
Whoa, check it out.

09:32.063 --> 09:35.232
You can get credit for playing
intramural frisbee golf.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.702
Okay, you can take a class
on the Civil War.

09:37.769 --> 09:38.869
Why would I take a class

09:38.937 --> 09:40.336
on something that's
already happened?

09:40.404 --> 09:42.172
Look, you guys have
already had your say.

09:42.239 --> 09:45.141
Now I want to try
something that I want to try.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.877
And I'm gonna make my choice
as I always do,

09:47.945 --> 09:50.880
at random.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.218
As she was
burned at the stake,

09:55.285 --> 09:56.484
Joan of Arc did not cower.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.154
She did not
beg for mercy.

09:59.222 --> 10:01.389
she said, in a strong,
clear voice,

10:01.457 --> 10:04.326
"I am not afraid.
I was born to do this."

10:04.393 --> 10:05.961
I want to be
burned at the stake.

10:06.029 --> 10:07.562
Many societal
institutions

10:07.630 --> 10:10.332
were established
solely to oppress women.

10:10.399 --> 10:11.867
To this day,

10:11.935 --> 10:14.936
some feminists have even
condemned marriage

10:15.003 --> 10:17.405
as a glorified form
of slavery.

10:17.473 --> 10:19.674
Amen.

10:19.742 --> 10:21.876
That class was awesome.

10:21.944 --> 10:23.978
I wholeheartedly agree.

10:24.046 --> 10:26.348
If that woman weren't so
violently opposed to marriage,

10:26.415 --> 10:29.049
I think I would
propose to her.

10:29.117 --> 10:30.718
Well, then,
it's decided.

10:30.785 --> 10:33.487
Andy Dwyer will be taking
"women's lasers."

10:33.555 --> 10:34.988
"Women's studies."

10:35.056 --> 10:37.958
Sorry. God, I cannot
stop thinking about lasers.

10:38.025 --> 10:39.159
"Women's studies."

10:39.227 --> 10:40.227
Is there such thing
as "women's lasers"?

10:40.295 --> 10:41.428
That'd be
my number one pick.

10:41.996 --> 10:44.497
Excuse me,
what the heck is going on here?

10:44.565 --> 10:46.031
Just preparing
for the grand opening

10:46.099 --> 10:48.834
of this tiny
but very intrusIVE park.

10:48.902 --> 10:49.969
We were told
this would have

10:50.036 --> 10:51.537
very little impact
on the neighborhood.

10:51.605 --> 10:53.406
This flyer has
hundreds of events.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.841
There are fireworks
every night at midnight?

10:55.909 --> 10:56.942
They start at midnight.

10:57.010 --> 10:58.444
Who knows when
they're gonna end?

10:58.512 --> 11:00.246
Look, I don't even know
the impact of this park,

11:00.313 --> 11:03.382
because the city skipped
an environmental impact report.

11:03.449 --> 11:05.250
So we don't know
about traffic problems

11:05.318 --> 11:07.586
or sound or lights
or crime.

11:07.654 --> 11:08.853
I mean,
it's all a mystery.

11:08.921 --> 11:10.121
Don't you work
for the government?

11:10.189 --> 11:11.990
I do, Joe.
Yeah, that's how I know

11:12.057 --> 11:13.792
just how high
this conspiracy goes.

11:13.859 --> 11:15.594
What can we do about it?

11:15.662 --> 11:17.728
I'm glad you asked.
I have some ideas.

11:17.796 --> 11:19.597
These are
our current park rangers.

11:19.665 --> 11:21.832
What are they up to?
No one cares.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.668
They're boring,
and I hate them.

11:23.735 --> 11:26.870
But coming this spring
to the style network...

11:26.938 --> 11:28.406
<i>Ranger Reality Show.</i>

11:28.473 --> 11:29.540
I'm sorry, tom,
but Chris,

11:29.608 --> 11:31.609
he just wanted us
to choose a new font.

11:31.677 --> 11:33.410
I mean, really,
you've gone way off track.

11:33.477 --> 11:35.111
Well, guess what, Jerry?
I'm a dreamer.

11:35.179 --> 11:36.613
Okay? I dream big.
Deal with it.

11:36.681 --> 11:38.782
Tom, weekends
are for dreaming.

11:38.849 --> 11:41.751
You are a government worker.
This is a government job.

11:41.819 --> 11:43.085
Plus isn't dreaming big

11:43.153 --> 11:46.088
exactly what got you in trouble
with your old company?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.263
- Hey, where you going, Joe?
- Bathroom break.

11:55.332 --> 11:56.432
No, get back
over there.

11:56.499 --> 11:58.066
I'll find you a bottle
or something.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.369
Where did
all these people come from?

12:00.437 --> 12:02.438
And why did they turn
so quickly on this project?

12:02.505 --> 12:03.672
Well,
you know how it goes.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.940
It only takes one nut job
to get people riled up.

12:06.007 --> 12:07.308
I hate to say this,

12:07.376 --> 12:08.476
but I think
we're gonna have to do

12:08.544 --> 12:10.445
that environmental
impact report.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.948
They are explicitly
demanding it.

12:14.015 --> 12:16.183
Hey, everybody,
listen up.

12:16.251 --> 12:18.886
Uh, in response
to your complaints,

12:18.954 --> 12:22.121
we are cancelling
all of these disruptive events.

12:22.189 --> 12:23.690
This park
is just gonna be

12:23.758 --> 12:26.259
a quiet patch of grass,
harming nobody.

12:26.327 --> 12:28.762
Everybody cool?

12:28.830 --> 12:31.264
Great.

12:31.332 --> 12:33.266
Dream team.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.535
Actually, Chris, I know you
think that we're a dream team--

12:35.603 --> 12:36.869
Dream team!

12:36.936 --> 12:37.870
Yeah.

12:37.937 --> 12:40.305
But we're not.

12:40.374 --> 12:42.941
You see, Leslie here
is a team of one.

12:43.009 --> 12:45.644
And that might be
a very good team,

12:45.712 --> 12:48.714
but she kind of steamrolls
the rest of her team,

12:48.782 --> 12:51.450
me,
to do whatever she wants.

12:51.518 --> 12:54.018
Regardless of how the rest
of her team,

12:54.086 --> 12:55.054
me,

12:55.786 --> 12:56.954
feels.

12:57.122 --> 13:01.125
So I don't think we should
work together anymore.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.796
Wow.
That was very hard to hear.

13:04.864 --> 13:06.631
So many negative words.

13:07.399 --> 13:11.368
I just need
to process this.

13:11.436 --> 13:12.503
Okay,
the dream team is dead.

13:12.570 --> 13:14.070
But you guys
had a great run.

13:14.538 --> 13:16.540
Oh, and the park is open.
Yay!

13:17.608 --> 13:19.209
Good job with that.

13:21.608 --> 13:24.809
Hello ma'am,
who is just as equal as man,

13:25.169 --> 13:29.873
I would like one ticket
for, uh, women.

13:29.941 --> 13:33.343
He would like to register
for Women's studies.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.145
Okay.
Here's the registration form.

13:35.213 --> 13:36.713
Ooh!

13:36.781 --> 13:40.382
And we'll need a check
or money order for $940.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.717
Why?

13:41.785 --> 13:43.819
Why didn't you tell me
it was so expensive?

13:43.887 --> 13:45.154
I didn't know.

13:45.222 --> 13:46.588
My parents
pay for my classes.

13:46.656 --> 13:47.923
I'll just have them
pay for yours too.

13:47.991 --> 13:51.593
Oh, God, no!
That's embarrassing.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.428
I know.

13:53.496 --> 13:55.463
I'm gonna beg for money in
the street like a drug addict.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.798
- No.
- Yeah.

13:56.866 --> 13:57.832
Oh my God.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.234
Everything in my life
is going wrong right now.

13:59.502 --> 14:02.270
Whose fault is this?
I demand to know.

14:02.338 --> 14:04.205
Actually--

14:04.273 --> 14:05.206
Ben thinks
that I'm a steamroller?

14:05.274 --> 14:06.374
That's unbelievable.

14:06.442 --> 14:07.843
How dare he think
that I'm a steamroller?

14:07.910 --> 14:09.177
Leslie,
I'm just telling you this--

14:09.244 --> 14:10.778
I know, he's going through
a phase right now,

14:10.846 --> 14:12.680
and eventually we're gonna
both be friends again.

14:12.747 --> 14:14.682
No, what I was gonna say
is that you really are--

14:14.749 --> 14:16.116
Working too hard.
I know, Ann,

14:16.184 --> 14:17.885
you keep starting all these
sentences and not finishing--

14:17.953 --> 14:19.386
You're a steamroller!

14:19.454 --> 14:22.923
You are a massive,
enormous, runaway steamroller

14:22.991 --> 14:26.793
with no brakes and a cement
brick on the gas pedal.

14:27.361 --> 14:29.596
You made me watch all eight
<i>Harry Potter</i> movies.

14:29.663 --> 14:30.964
I don't even
like <i>Harry Potter.</i>

14:31.031 --> 14:32.999
That's insane.
You love <i>Harry Potter.</i>

14:33.066 --> 14:34.767
You've seen
all eight movies!

14:34.835 --> 14:37.069
When we go out to a bar,
you order my drinks for me.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.071
Because you order white wine,
and it gives you a headache.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.306
Well, it's my headache!

14:40.374 --> 14:43.041
Leslie,
you do what you want,

14:43.109 --> 14:44.576
you ignore
what other people want,

14:44.644 --> 14:46.478
and you hear
only what you want to hear.

14:47.546 --> 14:51.216
Okay. I know.
I know I do this.

14:51.983 --> 14:53.451
I'm the worst.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.353
No, you're
very passionate.

14:55.421 --> 14:56.922
You just push
too hard sometimes.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.289
Well, you should
call me a bulldozer

14:58.357 --> 15:00.625
rather than
a steamroller.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.459
I'm sorry.

15:02.828 --> 15:03.661
It's gonna be okay.

15:04.229 --> 15:07.932
Is it?
Honestly, is it?

15:08.500 --> 15:11.668
I mean, I guess I just
need to leave Ben alone.

15:11.736 --> 15:15.771
That's what
he says he wants.

15:15.839 --> 15:19.208
Okay.

15:19.276 --> 15:23.179
Well, this steamroller
is hangin' up her...

15:23.247 --> 15:25.348
The rolly thing
on the front of the machine.

15:25.416 --> 15:26.749
What do you--
what do you call that?

15:26.816 --> 15:28.884
- The roller?
- Probably.

15:28.952 --> 15:31.119
Okay.

15:31.187 --> 15:33.155
Got you a little
pick-me-up, Tommy.

15:33.222 --> 15:36.191
A triple-decker ham and cheese
from the cafeteria.

15:36.259 --> 15:37.459
Always makes me feel better.

15:37.527 --> 15:40.695
Two pathetic guys
eating pathetic sandwiches.

15:40.763 --> 15:41.696
Sounds terrific.

15:41.764 --> 15:42.797
I guess I'm Jerry now.

15:42.865 --> 15:44.566
After work,
I'll just go home,

15:44.633 --> 15:46.334
straight to my boring house,

15:46.402 --> 15:48.835
kiss my wife,
and have a home-cooked meal

15:48.903 --> 15:52.573
with my three
beautiful daughters.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.175
What a miserable life.

15:54.242 --> 15:57.211
I have been here,
well, 30-some years,

15:57.279 --> 15:58.745
and the best way
to cope with this job

15:58.813 --> 16:01.182
is to do everything
the exact same way

16:01.249 --> 16:03.450
every day.

16:03.517 --> 16:05.218
Heck, I still use
my original I.D. Card

16:05.286 --> 16:06.252
from my first day
on the job.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.089
Check this out.

16:09.156 --> 16:10.190
Oh, my God.

16:10.257 --> 16:11.357
I got to go.

16:11.425 --> 16:14.360
Put my sammie in the fridge.

16:17.565 --> 16:20.365
Mouse Rat CD, $30.

16:20.433 --> 16:23.702
Candy bars, $50.
$50.

16:23.769 --> 16:25.404
God, people here
are so cheap.

16:25.472 --> 16:26.572
April, where have you been?

16:26.639 --> 16:29.508
Over two phone calls
came in unimpeded.

16:29.576 --> 16:31.843
We're raising money
for my college education, Ron.

16:31.911 --> 16:34.646
I took a second job
back at my old job.

16:34.714 --> 16:36.147
Do you want a shoe shine?

16:36.248 --> 16:37.948
It's $100.

16:38.016 --> 16:39.083
Laugh all you want, Kyle.

16:39.151 --> 16:40.884
I already took the money
out of your wallet.

16:40.952 --> 16:44.155
Oh.

16:44.223 --> 16:46.424
Good news, son.

16:46.492 --> 16:51.628
You have just won
a Ron Swanson scholarship.

16:51.695 --> 16:53.930
I don't think so.
I don't remember applying for--

16:53.998 --> 16:54.931
No, An--Andy.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.134
Ron Swanson...

16:57.201 --> 16:59.068
Scholarship.

17:00.137 --> 17:01.639
Wait, are you serious?

17:06.344 --> 17:07.276
Stop this.

17:07.344 --> 17:08.710
No.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.878
Stop,
or you lose the money.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.414
Why not?

17:12.482 --> 17:14.715
I like the kid,
and I have the money.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.618
One thing
I promised myself

17:16.685 --> 17:18.354
when I buried gold
in my backyard

17:18.421 --> 17:21.589
was that I'd never be a hoarder
or a miser about it.

17:21.657 --> 17:22.691
Hey.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.759
Okay, is this
health department business

17:24.826 --> 17:25.893
or Leslie business?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.494
You need to go talk to her.

17:27.563 --> 17:28.496
Why?
So she can force me

17:28.564 --> 17:30.665
to spend time
with her again?

17:30.732 --> 17:32.900
No. No way.
I'm done talking.

17:32.968 --> 17:33.934
Listen,
I know she can be

17:34.002 --> 17:35.903
strong-willed
and difficult, okay?

17:35.971 --> 17:37.738
She once made me eat
an entire cheesecake

17:37.806 --> 17:39.473
at a potluck
so she didn't look bad.

17:39.541 --> 17:42.676
But I really think
she's ready to listen.

17:42.743 --> 17:44.744
You ate
an entire cheesecake?

17:44.812 --> 17:46.813
Why didn't you just
throw it away?

17:46.881 --> 17:48.382
Because with everything
she's done for me,

17:48.449 --> 17:50.750
I would eat
ten cheesecakes for her.

17:50.818 --> 17:52.919
Also, P.S.,
it was delicious and amazing,

17:52.987 --> 17:54.521
like everything she does.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.722
Will you please just
talk to her? For my sake?

17:56.790 --> 17:57.956
I don't have
unlimited texting,

17:58.024 --> 18:00.459
and when she can't talk
to you, she texts me.

18:04.531 --> 18:08.167
So we take the old logo
from the 1970s,

18:08.235 --> 18:09.935
and we make limited-edition
hats, posters,

18:10.003 --> 18:11.369
t-shirts, everything.

18:11.437 --> 18:12.737
People love limited editions,

18:12.805 --> 18:15.307
plus parents will get swept up
in the nostalgia

18:15.374 --> 18:16.441
and want to go to the parks

18:16.509 --> 18:17.975
to recreate the fun
they had growing up.

18:18.043 --> 18:20.312
This... is amazing.

18:20.379 --> 18:22.714
It is possibly the best idea
anyone has had

18:22.781 --> 18:24.516
in this government
in 100 years.

18:24.584 --> 18:25.950
Tom, terrific.

18:26.018 --> 18:30.120
Thanks, but most of the credit
goes to my number-four, Jerry.

18:30.188 --> 18:31.822
He shared some words of wisdom
with me today,

18:31.889 --> 18:33.490
and while he was yammering on
about whatever,

18:33.558 --> 18:35.259
I happened to see
his old I.D. Card.

18:35.327 --> 18:37.027
Thanks, buddy.

18:37.095 --> 18:38.295
Yeah.

18:42.901 --> 18:44.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:44.401 --> 18:46.068
I wasn't sure
you were gonna come.

18:46.136 --> 18:48.238
Well, I got very curious

18:48.305 --> 18:50.005
when you only left me
one voicemail message,

18:50.073 --> 18:52.508
instead of your usual 20.

18:52.576 --> 18:54.210
I'm trying to be
a little less intense

18:54.278 --> 18:56.346
and a little more
considerate.

18:56.413 --> 18:57.747
Here, have a seat.

18:57.814 --> 18:59.348
But only if you want to.

18:59.415 --> 19:01.284
Okay.
I want to.

19:03.453 --> 19:05.854
I never listened
to what you wanted,

19:05.921 --> 19:08.990
or how you wanted us to be
when things...

19:09.058 --> 19:10.259
Ended between us.

19:10.326 --> 19:12.026
I just decided
what <i>I</i> wanted,

19:12.094 --> 19:14.663
and I got upset when
you didn't want the same thing.

19:14.731 --> 19:16.564
I know that's not fair,

19:16.632 --> 19:18.499
and I'm very sorry.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.736
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

19:21.803 --> 19:24.805
If you don't want to have
any more contact with me,

19:24.873 --> 19:26.907
I finally understand.

19:26.975 --> 19:28.909
I--I don't want that.

19:28.977 --> 19:30.611
Really.

19:30.679 --> 19:34.514
But I just think
it's for the best.

19:34.582 --> 19:36.516
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:39.987 --> 19:41.921
Okay.

19:44.492 --> 19:46.459
There is another option.

19:47.527 --> 19:49.194
We could just say "screw it"

19:49.262 --> 19:51.397
and do this thing
for real.

19:52.464 --> 19:53.265
What?

19:53.333 --> 19:54.767
I miss you like crazy.

19:54.834 --> 19:57.903
I think about you
all the time.

19:57.970 --> 20:00.606
I want to be with you.

20:00.674 --> 20:04.108
So let's just
say "screw it."

20:04.176 --> 20:05.676
No, we would have
to tell Chris.

20:05.744 --> 20:06.511
Yeah.

20:06.578 --> 20:07.645
It could turn
into a scandal.

20:07.713 --> 20:08.813
- Yeah.
- It could hurt your campaign.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.348
I mean, how would
you imagine we do this?

20:10.416 --> 20:11.449
I don't know.

20:11.517 --> 20:13.951
But I--I know how I feel,

20:14.019 --> 20:17.021
and I want to be with you.

20:17.088 --> 20:19.656
But I'm done
steamrolling people.

20:19.724 --> 20:22.793
This is how I feel.
How do you feel?

20:31.880 --> 20:32.680
First day.

20:32.981 --> 20:33.680
You ready?

20:33.681 --> 20:35.516
As ready as I'll ever be.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.217
Oh, crap, I forgot my books.
And my computer.

20:38.285 --> 20:40.620
Just pay attention
to the lecture and enjoy.

20:40.687 --> 20:43.455
My first day of college,
my father dropped me off

20:43.923 --> 20:45.390
at the steel mill.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.693
He didn't think
I should go to college.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.762
But I hitched a ride,
enrolled,

20:49.830 --> 20:51.997
and learned a lot.

20:52.065 --> 20:53.332
I hope Andy does too.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.966
We need to start
teaching women football,

20:55.033 --> 20:56.735
teaching women U.F.C.,

20:56.802 --> 20:58.670
teaching them to drive trucks
without crashing.

20:58.738 --> 21:00.438
"Hey, maybe I'm only sexy.

21:00.506 --> 21:01.639
"Then--maybe that's
all you see,

21:01.707 --> 21:03.074
"but at least you can give me
extra money.

21:03.141 --> 21:04.409
"Tip money and stuff.

21:04.477 --> 21:06.210
I'll flirt with you,
write my name on a napkin."

21:06.278 --> 21:08.546
They're gonna do it
in a right, kind of legal way

21:08.614 --> 21:10.714
that empowers prostitution.

21:10.782 --> 21:11.982
We don't rest
until we get that.

21:12.049 --> 21:13.884
That will be progress.

21:13.951 --> 21:16.887
That is extremely incorrect.

21:16.954 --> 21:18.655
I thought--
I thought maybe it was

21:18.723 --> 21:19.923
when I was--
I, uh--

21:19.991 --> 21:23.260
I'll get 'em next time.
Back to you, Professor.
