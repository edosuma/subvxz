Not out here.

then double back and go
after the pioneers next.

circle the wagons.

they double back as move on.

back there and you're here.

41:17.126 --> 41:18.563
[gunfire]

41:26.222 --> 41:29.399
- You keep running,
don't stop, no matter what!

41:29.487 --> 41:31.445
[whooping]

41:48.157 --> 41:49.507
[gunshots]

42:19.145 --> 42:20.450
[grunts]

42:52.787 --> 42:53.658
- I felt no fear.

42:56.182 --> 42:57.662
It simply became another race.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.754
We fear what we don't know.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.016
I knew what would happen.

43:06.453 --> 43:11.589
I would win the race
or I would be killed.

43:11.676 --> 43:14.504
There was comfort
in the simplicity of it.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.420
Even though I could
hear hooves getting closer,

43:17.507 --> 43:19.118
I felt no fear.

43:19.205 --> 43:22.991
[music]

43:36.135 --> 43:39.312
There is horror
to every killing.

43:39.399 --> 43:42.271
Even when it's justified.

43:42.358 --> 43:46.232
Even when I killed,
I was horrified.

43:46.319 --> 43:49.627
But watching Sam kill
was like watching a lion

43:49.714 --> 43:51.759
hurl itself into a deer.

43:59.549 --> 44:05.381
His fury was so magnificent,
there was no time for horror.

44:05.468 --> 44:06.731
Not even for the men he killed.

44:08.820 --> 44:12.475
[music]

44:12.562 --> 44:15.130
I questioned my mind.

44:15.217 --> 44:18.699
I wondered if I am the one
who is dead

44:18.786 --> 44:20.527
and this is all a dream.

44:24.792 --> 44:31.233
I watched him ride away
and decided I must be awake.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.408
I must be alive.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.369
Then I chased after him.

44:36.456 --> 44:37.762
[gunfire]

44:53.429 --> 44:54.779
[grunts]

44:56.868 --> 44:58.521
[whooping, gunfire]

45:04.876 --> 45:05.746
[gunshot]

45:31.990 --> 45:33.121
[gunshot]

45:35.602 --> 45:36.734
- Ah!

45:51.183 --> 45:52.097
- How bad?

45:55.230 --> 45:56.405
- Went through your belt.

45:56.492 --> 45:58.277
- Take it off.
[grunts]

46:03.195 --> 46:04.631
What the hell?
It sits right there.

46:04.718 --> 46:05.806
- Get it out.

46:05.893 --> 46:06.938
- I think I can squeeze it out.

46:09.331 --> 46:11.681
- Ah!

46:11.769 --> 46:13.205
[grunts]

46:17.644 --> 46:19.733
- Little souvenir for your son.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.691
The bullet that
didn't kill you.

46:27.436 --> 46:29.699
- Just a ricochet.

46:29.787 --> 46:30.918
Ain't in too deep.

46:31.005 --> 46:32.964
- Still got to dig
that lead out.

46:34.879 --> 46:37.620
How's the other one?

46:37.707 --> 46:40.319
- Just skinned me.

46:40.406 --> 46:42.277
- I think you used up
the last of your luck, Thomas.

46:45.106 --> 46:46.629
- How bad is your'n.

46:46.716 --> 46:47.848
- I didn't get hit.

46:53.114 --> 46:54.812
Shit. What the hell?

47:00.295 --> 47:01.731
I can't find it.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.298
Do you see it?

47:04.430 --> 47:05.648
- Turn around.

47:07.912 --> 47:11.306
- Got to be coming
from somewhere.

47:11.393 --> 47:12.830
- Take off your hat, Captain.

47:19.227 --> 47:23.014
- Ah...

47:23.101 --> 47:24.319
I'll be damned.
[chuckles]

47:27.714 --> 47:29.759
- Now you used up all
your luck, too, Captain.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.892
[music]

47:49.431 --> 47:51.390
- If I recall, Thomas,
this one is yours.

47:51.477 --> 47:52.913
- She is.

47:54.349 --> 47:57.178
- [laughs]
I swear, Shea,

47:57.265 --> 47:58.701
when you bite off
more than you can chew,

47:58.788 --> 48:00.225
you sure bite big.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.879
- I ain't ashamed to say it,

48:01.966 --> 48:04.272
you are a beautiful
sight, Charlie.

48:04.359 --> 48:06.057
What the hell are you
doing out here?

48:06.144 --> 48:10.931
- Same as you apparently.
Hunting bandits and strays.

48:11.018 --> 48:14.892
Though you seem to herd
all your bandits up at once.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.546
- Hell, we sure appreciate you.

48:17.633 --> 48:19.940
- Killing cattle thieves is one
the West's five great pleasures.

48:20.027 --> 48:21.115
No need for thanks.

48:21.202 --> 48:23.422
You can save your thanks
for them.

48:23.509 --> 48:24.989
Shea: We'll do more than that.

48:25.076 --> 48:27.208
You're only up to five now?

48:27.295 --> 48:29.428
- Well, I'm pickier
than you, sir.

48:29.515 --> 48:32.692
I added horse and sunrise
from the saddle

48:32.779 --> 48:35.564
and riding the wild country,
I thought they deserved a spot.

48:35.651 --> 48:37.479
Shea: I thought they was
already on your list.

48:37.566 --> 48:39.829
Charlie: No, just added.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.919
Don't like to get up that early.
- [laughs]

48:48.360 --> 48:49.491
- You're hurt.

48:49.578 --> 48:50.928
- I'm fine.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.280
Are you fine?

48:57.717 --> 48:59.023
- I'm fine, too.

49:04.158 --> 49:06.987
[music]

49:18.346 --> 49:19.478
[grunts]

49:19.565 --> 49:20.958
Ah...

49:25.310 --> 49:28.139
- Don't suppose you care
to bury these folks?

49:28.226 --> 49:29.357
- Tell you the truth, Charlie,

49:29.444 --> 49:30.445
I don't think they're
worth the hole.

49:32.926 --> 49:34.493
- Where's your camp?

49:34.580 --> 49:36.799
- I know it.

49:36.886 --> 49:39.019
- Well, they may not deserve it

49:39.106 --> 49:39.977
but someone should say
a prayer

49:40.064 --> 49:41.804
over these sorry
sons of bitches.

49:41.891 --> 49:43.806
I doubt you care to hear.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.460
- I don't.

49:45.547 --> 49:47.201
We need to get back
to our people.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.551
- We'll meet you there.

49:49.638 --> 49:53.164
[music]

50:29.809 --> 50:30.984
- Elsa?

50:32.855 --> 50:33.987
Elsa!

50:47.783 --> 50:49.220
- Give me your horse.

50:53.224 --> 50:54.051
I ain't aski--

50:55.704 --> 50:56.618
[grunts]

50:56.705 --> 51:02.320
[music]

51:10.676 --> 51:13.026
- She wouldn't speak when
we got back to camp.

51:13.113 --> 51:14.810
[crying]

51:14.897 --> 51:20.338
Wouldn't look at my father...
Wouldn't look at me.

51:20.425 --> 51:23.210
I heard her crying
by the fire before dawn.

51:23.297 --> 51:27.649
I sat beside her
and asked her what was wrong.

51:27.736 --> 51:30.870
She said she killed a man
over a horse.

51:30.957 --> 51:34.787
And now John was the only hope
our family has to reach Heaven.

51:37.659 --> 51:41.446
I didn't have the heart
to tell her there is no
Heaven to go to,

51:41.533 --> 51:43.143
because we're in it already.

51:44.884 --> 51:47.626
We're in hell, too.
They coexist.

51:47.713 --> 51:50.019
Right beside each other.

51:50.107 --> 51:54.111
And God is the land.

51:54.198 --> 51:57.679
[music]

52:11.389 --> 52:14.305
