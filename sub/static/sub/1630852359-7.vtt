[clicks tongue]

00:40.736 --> 00:42.738
- Come on, cows.
Hya, hya!

00:42.825 --> 00:44.261
Come on, move,
move, move!

00:52.182 --> 00:53.879
[lowing]

00:59.102 --> 01:00.843
- Got one speed, that one.
Bullet fast.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.237
- Damn cow been a dart
since we rounded her up.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.934
- Ain't talking about the cow.

01:06.718 --> 01:07.763
[horse snorts]

01:12.942 --> 01:14.248
If she ever learns to rope,
we might be out of a job.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.642
- Whatever you do,
don't teach her.

01:17.729 --> 01:18.426

01:20.645 --> 01:24.127
Elsa: The best way to know
if land is truly undiscovered

01:24.214 --> 01:25.781
is to seek words
to describe it.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.222
When you can't,
you know it's virgin land.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.442
Untouched by our dirty hands.

01:36.574 --> 01:40.578
To see it
is to be silenced by it.

01:40.665 --> 01:46.149
Made speechless
by its endless uniformity...

01:46.236 --> 01:49.326
To crest a rise is to see
another that is identical.

01:51.589 --> 01:54.331
One must read the sun
and stars like a sailor

01:54.418 --> 01:55.637
to navigate this place.

01:58.727 --> 02:02.557
We've seen nothing
but grass for over a week:

02:02.644 --> 02:07.605
no game, no birds, no snakes,

02:07.692 --> 02:10.217
not even a lizard,

02:10.304 --> 02:12.871
and no evidence
the human race still exists.

02:12.958 --> 02:16.527
[music]

02:16.614 --> 02:19.269
But the plains
are littered with bones.

02:41.726 --> 02:44.425
The dirty hand of man
can go unnoticed in the city.

02:46.775 --> 02:50.648
Because his dirty
hand made the city.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.783
But in this place,

02:54.870 --> 02:57.220
where innocence
is a mineral in the soil,

02:59.701 --> 03:03.183
the filth of our touch
is an apocalypse.

[lowing]

[music]

03:35.737 --> 03:36.955
- I see 'em.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.305
- What do we do?

03:38.392 --> 03:39.828
- Keep holding the herd.
Don't worry about them.

03:39.915 --> 03:40.829
They're just payin' the tax.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.744
- What tax?

03:42.831 --> 03:45.007
- You gotta pay a tax when you
graze cattle in Comanche land.

03:45.094 --> 03:47.270
Well, you don't "gotta",

03:47.357 --> 03:48.706
but if you want
to stay out of a gunfight,

03:48.793 --> 03:50.099
it's a pretty good idea...

03:50.186 --> 03:52.057
- The Comanches
can charge a tax?

03:52.144 --> 03:53.494
- It's their land.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.843
They can do whatever they want.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.410
- The only people who think
this is America

03:56.497 --> 03:58.281
still live in Washington.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.065
- There's water in this draw.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.198
Push the herd to it.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.592
We'll make camp here.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.333
Carve one out
for the cook first.

to tell you this once!

you grab a fork,

and a good one,

07:26.533 --> 07:28.491

is probably headed his way, son.

Okay, a whole steak.

- Sam.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.216

of the man who killed my wife.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.703
I know because
I made him tell me.

Then I killed him
and took it.

12:43.414 --> 12:44.241
- I killed a man.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.422
But I didn't know
to take his name.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.037
With his name you mourn forever.

Your name is Lightning.

Lightning doesn't mourn.

Doesn't do that either.

- Where are you going?
- To dream of indoor plumbing.

15:08.995 --> 15:09.996
- Are you happy?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
- In general or at this moment?

As a mother.

Beyond our control out here.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.161

a son I adore,
and a daughter I envy...

16:05.921 --> 16:06.922
I am very happy.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.538
However, if you don't
get some sleep,

I will not envy you tomorrow.
- Hm.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.200
I love you.

16:29.249 --> 16:33.079
- People think because
it's where rain comes from,

16:33.166 --> 16:36.647
clouds are filled with water.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.736
But how can that be?

16:38.823 --> 16:41.522
How can water float
above us then fall,

16:41.609 --> 16:44.046
as though gravity
only applies to the sky

16:44.133 --> 16:45.178
when the sky lets it.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.617
But that would mean
the sky thinks

16:49.704 --> 16:52.446
and clouds are alive
and they decide to let it rain.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.579
But how do
they decide where to rain?

16:55.666 --> 16:58.843
And when...

16:58.930 --> 17:03.544
Why do clouds choose to flood
one place and deny another

17:03.631 --> 17:06.634
until the earth cracks
and field becomes desert?

17:09.202 --> 17:11.987
Maybe there's
no such thing as gravity.

17:12.074 --> 17:17.601
Maybe everything scientists
have "discovered" is a lie,

17:17.688 --> 17:20.387
and wind is the world
laughing at us.

17:27.176 --> 17:31.006
- How's it been with bandits?

17:31.093 --> 17:32.442
- Worse the way you're going.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.709
And you're the perfect size:
big enough to be a prize,

17:38.796 --> 17:40.624
small enough to fight.

17:40.711 --> 17:42.452
Here is mostly thieves.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.628
North of Kansas
and the Wyoming,

17:44.715 --> 17:46.195
they're still having a war.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.721
Wagons don't go
that way anymore.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.463
People take the train...

17:53.550 --> 17:54.899
If I knew a way
around I'd tell you.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.164
- The way around is they
decide to live in Colorado.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.256
- The sky is angry.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.087
Thieves out here
use the storms to hide.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.176
- I'll keep that in mind.

18:18.532 --> 18:22.405
You're welcome to stay the
night, ride out in the morning.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.494
- The storm will be
here tomorrow.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.801
You should leave, too.

18:26.888 --> 18:27.628
- I wish I could.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.676
[music]

18:32.763 --> 18:35.810
- Take them to Colorado.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.029
Leave them there.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.727

Not out here.

then double back and go
after the pioneers next.

circle the wagons.

they double back as move on.

41:26.222 --> 41:29.399
- You keep running,
don't stop, no matter what!

41:29.487 --> 41:31.445
[whooping]

41:48.157 --> 41:49.507
[gunshots]

42:19.145 --> 42:20.450
[grunts]

42:52.787 --> 42:53.658
- I felt no fear.

42:56.182 --> 42:57.662
It simply became another race.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.754
We fear what we don't know.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.016
I knew what would happen.

43:06.453 --> 43:11.589
I would win the race
or I would be killed.

43:11.676 --> 43:14.504
There was comfort
in the simplicity of it.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.420
Even though I could
hear hooves getting closer,

43:17.507 --> 43:19.118
I felt no fear.

43:19.205 --> 43:22.991
[music]

43:36.135 --> 43:39.312
There is horror
to every killing.

43:39.399 --> 43:42.271
Even when it's justified.

43:42.358 --> 43:46.232
Even when I killed,
I was horrified.

43:46.319 --> 43:49.627
But watching Sam kill
was like watching a lion

43:49.714 --> 43:51.759
hurl itself into a deer.

43:59.549 --> 44:05.381
His fury was so magnificent,
there was no time for horror.

44:05.468 --> 44:06.731
Not even for the men he killed.

44:08.820 --> 44:12.475
[music]

44:12.562 --> 44:15.130
I questioned my mind.

44:15.217 --> 44:18.699
I wondered if I am the one
who is dead

44:18.786 --> 44:20.527
and this is all a dream.

44:24.792 --> 44:31.233
I watched him ride away
and decided I must be awake.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.408
I must be alive.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.369
Then I chased after him.

44:36.456 --> 44:37.762
[gunfire]

44:53.429 --> 44:54.779
[grunts]

44:56.868 --> 44:58.521
[whooping, gunfire]

45:04.876 --> 45:05.746
[gunshot]

45:31.990 --> 45:33.121
[gunshot]

45:35.602 --> 45:36.734
- Ah!

45:51.183 --> 45:52.097
- How bad?

45:55.230 --> 45:56.405
- Went through your belt.

45:56.492 --> 45:58.277
- Take it off.
[grunts]

46:03.195 --> 46:04.631
What the hell?
It sits right there.

46:04.718 --> 46:05.806
- Get it out.

46:05.893 --> 46:06.938
- I think I can squeeze it out.

46:09.331 --> 46:11.681
- Ah!

46:11.769 --> 46:13.205
[grunts]

46:17.644 --> 46:19.733
- Little souvenir for your son.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.691
The bullet that
didn't kill you.

46:27.436 --> 46:29.699
- Just a ricochet.

46:29.787 --> 46:30.918
Ain't in too deep.

46:31.005 --> 46:32.964
- Still got to dig
that lead out.

46:34.879 --> 46:37.620
How's the other one?

46:37.707 --> 46:40.319
- Just skinned me.

46:40.406 --> 46:42.277
- I think you used up
the last of your luck, Thomas.

46:45.106 --> 46:46.629
- How bad is your'n.

46:46.716 --> 46:47.848
- I didn't get hit.

46:53.114 --> 46:54.812
Shit. What the hell?

47:00.295 --> 47:01.731
I can't find it.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.298
Do you see it?

47:04.430 --> 47:05.648
- Turn around.

47:07.912 --> 47:11.306
- Got to be coming
from somewhere.

47:11.393 --> 47:12.830
- Take off your hat, Captain.

47:19.227 --> 47:23.014
- Ah...

47:23.101 --> 47:24.319
I'll be damned.
[chuckles]

47:27.714 --> 47:29.759
- Now you used up all
your luck, too, Captain.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.892
[music]

47:49.431 --> 47:51.390
- If I recall, Thomas,
this one is yours.

47:51.477 --> 47:52.913
- She is.

47:54.349 --> 47:57.178
- [laughs]
I swear, Shea,

47:57.265 --> 47:58.701
when you bite off
more than you can chew,

47:58.788 --> 48:00.225
you sure bite big.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.879
- I ain't ashamed to say it,

48:01.966 --> 48:04.272
you are a beautiful
sight, Charlie.

48:04.359 --> 48:06.057
What the hell are you
doing out here?

48:06.144 --> 48:10.931
- Same as you apparently.
Hunting bandits and strays.

48:11.018 --> 48:14.892
Though you seem to herd
all your bandits up at once.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.546
- Hell, we sure appreciate you.

48:17.633 --> 48:19.940
- Killing cattle thieves is one
the West's five great pleasures.

48:20.027 --> 48:21.115
No need for thanks.

48:21.202 --> 48:23.422
You can save your thanks
for them.

48:23.509 --> 48:24.989
Shea: We'll do more than that.

48:25.076 --> 48:27.208
You're only up to five now?

48:27.295 --> 48:29.428
- Well, I'm pickier
than you, sir.

48:29.515 --> 48:32.692
I added horse and sunrise
from the saddle

48:32.779 --> 48:35.564
and riding the wild country,
I thought they deserved a spot.

48:35.651 --> 48:37.479
Shea: I thought they was
already on your list.

48:37.566 --> 48:39.829
Charlie: No, just added.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.919
Don't like to get up that early.
- [laughs]

48:48.360 --> 48:49.491
- You're hurt.

48:49.578 --> 48:50.928
- I'm fine.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.280
Are you fine?

48:57.717 --> 48:59.023
- I'm fine, too.

49:04.158 --> 49:06.987
[music]

49:18.346 --> 49:19.478
[grunts]

49:19.565 --> 49:20.958
Ah...

49:25.310 --> 49:28.139
- Don't suppose you care
to bury these folks?

49:28.226 --> 49:29.357
- Tell you the truth, Charlie,

49:29.444 --> 49:30.445
I don't think they're
worth the hole.

49:32.926 --> 49:34.493
- Where's your camp?

49:34.580 --> 49:36.799
- I know it.

49:36.886 --> 49:39.019
- Well, they may not deserve it

49:39.106 --> 49:39.977
but someone should say
a prayer

49:40.064 --> 49:41.804
over these sorry
sons of bitches.

49:41.891 --> 49:43.806
I doubt you care to hear.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.460
- I don't.

49:45.547 --> 49:47.201
We need to get back
to our people.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.551
- We'll meet you there.

49:49.638 --> 49:53.164
[music]

50:29.809 --> 50:30.984
- Elsa?

50:32.855 --> 50:33.987
Elsa!

50:47.783 --> 50:49.220
- Give me your horse.

50:53.224 --> 50:54.051
I ain't aski--

50:55.704 --> 50:56.618
[grunts]

50:56.705 --> 51:02.320
[music]

51:10.676 --> 51:13.026
- She wouldn't speak when
we got back to camp.

51:13.113 --> 51:14.810
[crying]

51:14.897 --> 51:20.338
Wouldn't look at my father...
Wouldn't look at me.

51:20.425 --> 51:23.210
I heard her crying
by the fire before dawn.

51:23.297 --> 51:27.649
I sat beside her
and asked her what was wrong.

51:27.736 --> 51:30.870
She said she killed a man
over a horse.

51:30.957 --> 51:34.787
And now John was the only hope
our family has to reach Heaven.

51:37.659 --> 51:41.446
I didn't have the heart
to tell her there is no
Heaven to go to,

51:41.533 --> 51:43.143
because we're in it already.

51:44.884 --> 51:47.626
We're in hell, too.
They coexist.

51:47.713 --> 51:50.019
Right beside each other.

51:50.107 --> 51:54.111
And God is the land.

51:54.198 --> 51:57.679
[music]

52:11.389 --> 52:14.305
