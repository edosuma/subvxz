00:39.640 --> 00:40.680
Are you okay?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.200
Yeah.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.040
Where's James?

00:46.640 --> 00:48.120
They're taking his statement.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
He'll be okay.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.720
Okay.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
Do you want a drink?

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
I'm all right.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.880
<i>I can't do this any more.</i>

01:39.960 --> 01:42.560
So if that all looks okay to you,
just sign at the bottom.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.320
And then I can just go?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Yeah.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.400
I've got a suspended sentence.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
I know.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.760
You're just a witness.
She's confessed to everything.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
Right.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Okay.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.920
What's going to happen to her, to Bonnie?

02:03.400 --> 02:04.640
I don't know.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.000
I don't think she's very well.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.440
What can you do?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.120
Err...

02:16.280 --> 02:17.360
A bit more?

02:19.480 --> 02:20.480
Yeah.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.800
We'll need to speak to you again.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.360
Where can we find you?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.160
Uh...

02:40.640 --> 02:42.240
I'm sort of between places.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.760
Okay. Can I give
your girlfriend's address?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.640
She's not...

02:50.080 --> 02:51.320
She's not my girlfriend.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.440
<i>But she was my friend.</i>

02:58.760 --> 03:00.600
- Thanks for waiting.
- That's okay.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
Where's Alyssa?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.800
- Gone somewhere.
- What?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.480
We'll see her at home.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.480
Okay.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.656
- Where are you going?
- Thanks for the clothes.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.840
James.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.720
<i>After Bonnie,
after everything the night before,</i>

03:28.240 --> 03:30.240

Hey.

What are you doing here?

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Why are you wet?

12:01.880 --> 12:02.960

Uh, yeah, saying I'd be back later.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.280

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.000
What were they doing? Dogging?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.680
Sorry.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.040
It used to be a park.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.320
He was sitting on a bench.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.760
He told her he loved her straight away.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.960
She was walking her nan's whippet...

13:40.680 --> 13:42.280
and I was eating a sandwich.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.760
It was... just like something
out of a film.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.600
That's nice.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.000
You don't have to do it, James.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
I think I do.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.640
Okay.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.440
Oh, no.

14:26.040 --> 14:26.960
What?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.600
<i>I didn't know when,</i>

14:28.680 --> 14:30.160

14:35.960 --> 14:37.400
Oh, he's like a paste.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.280
It's still him.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.160
Maybe I just...

15:08.640 --> 15:09.760
just sort of pour him.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.720
It's shit being dead, isn't it?

15:38.480 --> 15:39.480
Yeah.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.720
You miss everything.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
Yeah.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.680
I'm sorry.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.440
What for?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.520
For trying to make you the answer.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
It's not fair.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.680
I've been quite shit too.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.760
I'm really hungry.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.160
Me too.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.400
You should have scattered him here.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.840
I'm joking.
