00:32.866 --> 00:35.826
I've spent the last 30 years
as a freelance writer...

00:36.912 --> 00:40.082
going wherever I could to do my job
and make a living.

00:40.791 --> 00:45.341
It's been a life of wandering around...

00:46.463 --> 00:49.933
and finding a good story,
getting an editor to agree to cover it...

00:51.051 --> 00:52.221
and assign me to it.

00:53.387 --> 00:57.557
As soon as, uh, it was done and over,
"Thank you very much,"

00:57.641 --> 00:59.851
<i>I'd throw it in a box like
these boxes you see...</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:01.595
<i>There are other rooms downstairs.</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.113
<i>...and start cranking on the next one.</i>

01:07.484 --> 01:09.324
Damn it, where the hell did I put it?

01:11.154 --> 01:15.494
Basically, this story,
"Who Killed Sister Cathy?"

01:17.327 --> 01:21.037
It's a 6000-word monster review
of the whole thing.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.420
I would not ever hear
the name Sister Cathy Cesnik

01:27.879 --> 01:31.089
until 1994
when the first stories began to emerge.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.637
<i>And that they included a woman</i>
<i>who said she had witnessed</i>

01:37.264 --> 01:39.144
<i>the body of the dead nun.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.983
Of course,
I was interested on a lot of levels.

01:47.274 --> 01:51.574
There's an on-the-record public story
of what happened to Sister Cathy,

01:51.653 --> 01:54.823
and then there's the world beneath
that was actually being lived.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.406
And to get at that mystery,

01:56.950 --> 02:00.950
I think, is our greatest
journalistic responsibility.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.418
<i>"Who Killed Sister Cathy?</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:09.842
<i>One of Maryland's Coldest</i>
<i>Murder Cases Heats Up,</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:11.301
<i>by Tom Nugent."</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:17.296
<i>"She lies buried</i>
<i>on the side of a steep hill</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:18.967
<i>in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania,</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:21.103
<i>a threadbare suburban town</i>

02:21.433 --> 02:23.983
<i>directly across the Allegheny River</i>
<i>from Pittsburgh.</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:31.819
<i>Her granite headstone offers the eye</i>
<i>only four stone-carved words,</i>

02:32.361 --> 02:39.331
<i>Sister Catherine Cesnik, S.S.N.D.,</i>
<i>1942-1969."</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:51.507
And so, we find ourselves, what,
47 years after the murder?

02:52.422 --> 02:53.922
The case is unsolved...

02:55.884 --> 02:59.354
we all go on day after day,

02:59.679 --> 03:02.059
and the boil continues to swell,

03:02.516 --> 03:06.306
and the people who were injured most
deeply continue to struggle and suffer.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.186
And the public continues to ask,
"What happened?"

03:11.274 --> 03:15.534
But these clues to what it was linger on
in a place like this attic.

03:16.822 --> 03:20.952
Those objects hold that energy
and they twist you...

03:21.743 --> 03:23.623
and turn you in the wind,

03:24.454 --> 03:28.584
and you start asking, you know,
"What was--? What is the past?

03:28.959 --> 03:29.789
What was it?"

04:42.407 --> 04:45.367
- Hey. Can we just sit down?
- Yeah, wherever you'd like.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.792
- I'll be right over.
- Okay.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.955
Can I get you all started
with something to drink?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.300
Um...

04:56.379 --> 05:00.179
- What kind of chardonnay do you have?
- I have Yellow Tail.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.638
Oh, that's fine.
That's what I drink at home... only.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.099
Hi. Um, I had a quick question.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.396
We've been using your excellent services
for about two years.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.941
We're looking into an old unsolved
murder case.

05:17.025 --> 05:21.355
My high-school teacher,
Sister Catherine Cesnik, in '69.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.081
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:26.159 --> 05:26.989
Come on over.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.372
-Here, come on. I'm Gemma.
-So, they tell me-- I'm Tom.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.705
You know where Keough is?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.535
-No. Why?
-Next to Cardinal Gibbons.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.535
K-E-O-U-G-H.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.797
-It's called Seton Keough now. Anyway...
-Yeah.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.549
in 1969, a nun at Archbishop Keough
was murdered.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.511
- In 1969?
- Mm-hm.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.064
And then her body was found
about two months later.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.638
- Wow.
- She had been murdered.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.933
-This is my e-mail address.
-Uh-huh.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.307
'Cause you're not on Facebook,

05:52.394 --> 05:54.104
- but you have e-mail?
- Yeah, I do.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.267
Okay. So, I'm not hitting on you, okay?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.276
-No, that's okay.
-I seriously am not.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.398
-Do you have much baggage?
-No.

06:00.902 --> 06:01.952
I'm one of the least...

06:04.406 --> 06:07.696
<i>My personality is such</i>
<i>that I'm really driven</i>

06:07.784 --> 06:09.794
<i>to find answers from other people.</i>

06:10.328 --> 06:13.918
<i>I will go out and talk to people,</i>
<i>knock on doors,</i>

06:13.999 --> 06:18.419
<i>calling, questioning</i>
<i>and asking them if they can help.</i>

06:19.754 --> 06:21.264
I'd asked once in the past.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.879
Sometimes I find if I ask twice,
they find them.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.982
Sometimes we have to
dig a little deeper.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.927
But this-- This is
an old open warrant.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.143
Okay, let's take a look.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.726
Now, we looked at them maybe a year ago,

06:31.808 --> 06:35.018
and they said that there was a box
of evidence that was missing

06:35.103 --> 06:37.693
and there were supposed
to be three file folders.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.859
So, we're sort of hoping maybe
they might have found their way back.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.152
If it's not there, we'll put a request in

06:44.237 --> 06:46.907
-for them to get that refiled for you.
-I can come back. Thank you.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.080
-Great.
-We're gonna keep our fingers crossed.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.201
Gemma Hoskins... bulldog.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.325
<i>She's the bulldog.</i>

06:56.082 --> 06:58.922
<i>Abbie Schaub is the intellectual.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:01.209
They're feisty, tough women.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.956
I've asked both of them:

07:03.048 --> 07:05.838
"Don't you guys wanna become
investigative journalists?

07:06.217 --> 07:10.257
Let's have some real fun." And they--
They tell me, "We'll do it our way."

07:17.896 --> 07:21.776
The first day she walked in and said,
"We're gonna read <i>The Scarlet Letter,</i>"

07:21.858 --> 07:22.858
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:27.203
<i>I was 13 and this really cool nun</i>
<i>was gonna read </i> The Scarlet Letter <i>with us?</i>

07:28.448 --> 07:32.078
I have never ever had a teacher
like that before.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.964
<i>Sister Cathy could have been</i>
<i>looked at as, like, a big sister.</i>

07:37.415 --> 07:41.535
She exemplified this spirit
of compassion and kindness.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.668
You felt like you were an individual
with her

07:43.755 --> 07:47.335
and she was, like, encouraging you
to bloom as a person.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.389
<i>When we started</i>
<i>doing </i> Romeo and Juliet,

07:52.472 --> 07:53.772
<i>I thought, "Oh, this--"</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:55.518
You know, "I'm barely gonna survive

07:55.600 --> 07:57.520
sitting through hours
of <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>"

07:58.144 --> 07:59.736
<i>But it got to the
point where I began</i>

07:59.748 --> 08:01.564
<i>looking forward to going
to English class.</i>

08:01.648 --> 08:03.398
<i>Who would've thought such a thing?</i>

08:04.401 --> 08:07.111
<i>I guess because she was so close</i>
<i>in age to us,</i>

08:07.654 --> 08:10.494
<i>everything she said was romantic.</i>

08:10.573 --> 08:14.493
<i>You know, English literature, how you can</i>
<i>express yourself through poems.</i>

08:14.577 --> 08:17.747
When you're an adolescent
and you're a girl,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.331
that resonates with you.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.501
And she was able to touch a lot of people
in a short amount of time.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.971
<i>She was murdered our senior year.</i>

08:28.466 --> 08:32.756
And it's always haunted many people
in the community. We're not the only ones.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.144
People pop up from 45, 50 years ago

08:36.224 --> 08:39.234
who say,
"I have a story I'd like to tell you."

08:39.309 --> 08:41.730
So, it's been an ongoing
urban legend almost.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.976
<i>Abbie and I found each other</i>

08:45.066 --> 08:48.606
<i>because we had not been in contact</i>
<i>with each other since we graduated.</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:51.449
Gemma's been the Nancy Drew, I think.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.121
She's good at getting people to talk
to her, calling them up and talk to her.

08:55.201 --> 08:59.711
Abbie does amazing research,
like no one I've ever met.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.499
I like to get on the phone,
talk to people, draw pictures...

09:02.584 --> 09:04.714
And I hate to talk to people,
so, that works.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.384
...of what-- Of what's going on.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.631
Our mission, we were driven
to find out who hurt Sister Cathy.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.297
We have people telling us to be careful.

09:14.637 --> 09:19.057
<i>Our concern was that</i>
<i>she fell into something evil,</i>

09:19.142 --> 09:21.232
<i>something bad, and got caught up with it.</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:25.818
We're told that the story
is not the nun's killing.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.149
The story is the cover-up
of a nun's story.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.644
<i>It worries me whether
or not we're looking</i>

09:30.656 --> 09:32.573
<i>at something bigger
than what we know of.</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:37.204
<i>It's a 45-year-old cold case,</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:39.695
<i>and I think we probably have</i>
<i>more information</i>

09:39.788 --> 09:43.998
<i>than any police officer or detective</i>
<i>has had on this case ever.</i>

09:45.794 --> 09:46.844
<i>We're in our 60s.</i>

09:46.920 --> 09:51.420
<i>Time is getting short for us to be able</i>
<i>to figure out what happened to Cathy.</i>

09:52.884 --> 09:55.354
<i>I don't think there's any shame</i>
<i>in not succeeding,</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:57.638
<i>but it would be wrong not to try.</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:23.122
<i>Sister Cathy was my 11th-grade</i>
<i>English teacher in 1969.</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:26.915
<i>November 7th...</i>

10:27.794 --> 10:28.924
<i>it was a Friday.</i>

10:29.546 --> 10:31.336
We had discussions after class.

10:31.422 --> 10:36.262
Just talking about what was going on
in my life and that kind of thing.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.222
<i>She was standing behind her desk</i>
<i>and I was standing next to her desk</i>

10:41.307 --> 10:43.017
<i>and... just talking.</i>

10:43.101 --> 10:46.351
Um, I don't even remember
what we were talking about

10:46.437 --> 10:50.437
until she said that she had to go shopping
that night for a gift...

10:51.234 --> 10:53.744
<i>for someone in her family.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:59.619
<i>She seemed really happy about it,</i>
<i>about this person, whoever it was.</i>

11:00.118 --> 11:02.288
She was excited
that they were getting married.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.673
<i>And then I went on to my next class.</i>

11:15.550 --> 11:19.390
<i>Cathy left high school</i>
<i>after her normal teaching day.</i>

11:22.056 --> 11:24.386
<i>She was back at her apartment</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

11:24.893 --> 11:28.103
<i>Uh, might have been-- I would assume</i>
<i>around three o'clock or so.</i>

11:30.982 --> 11:34.742
<i> Sister Catherine</i>
<i>and Sister Russell...</i>

11:35.570 --> 11:36.610
<i>they were roommates.</i>

11:37.488 --> 11:40.158
<i>They taught together at Keough and they...</i>

11:40.783 --> 11:45.583
were the two nuns who left the order,
became public-school teachers.

11:46.122 --> 11:50.342
<i>They rented an apartment</i>
<i>over on North Bend Road</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:51.998
<i>in the southwest part of the city.</i>

11:54.339 --> 11:55.839
<i>I interviewed Sister Russell...</i>

11:57.091 --> 12:00.641
<i>at her home in Carroll County.</i>

12:01.179 --> 12:05.179
A very nice lady,
but she was also very reluctant to talk.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.265
<i>Sister Russell was, um...</i>

12:08.895 --> 12:11.015
She was my algebra teacher.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.863
She was also the cheerleading coach.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.203
She was Cathy's friend.
Everybody knew that.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.606
They laughed together a lot.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.237
You'd see them in the hallway

12:21.324 --> 12:23.284
and you see them
at different places together.

12:24.285 --> 12:29.575
<i>But Russell was more of the left brain</i>
<i>and Cathy was the right.</i>

12:40.551 --> 12:44.561
<i>As far as we know,</i>
<i>she left the apartment parking lot</i>

12:44.639 --> 12:45.889
<i>somewhere around 7.</i>

12:46.766 --> 12:51.806
<i>Sister Russell, her roommate,</i>
<i>said that... this was a routine they did.</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:54.936
<i>She was gonna go shopping</i>
<i>to pick up some bakery buns.</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:57.654
<i>She was gonna buy an engagement gift</i>
<i>for her sister.</i>

13:00.238 --> 13:05.408
<i>She went from her apartment</i>
<i>to the Edmondson Village Shopping Center.</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.048
<i>It was very safe at the time.</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:20.760
<i>It was a local attraction</i>
<i>considered upscale.</i>

13:24.387 --> 13:27.137
<i>Sister Cathy went to the local bank,</i>

13:27.223 --> 13:29.563
<i>cashed her paycheck,</i>
<i>bought some dinner rolls.</i>

13:30.518 --> 13:32.438
<i>Now, accounts vary here.</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:35.975
<i>Several witnesses have told</i>
<i>the newspaper and the police</i>

13:36.524 --> 13:40.614
there's no doubt that the nun returns
to her parking space

13:41.154 --> 13:45.624
<i>but no one has proved</i>
<i>that she ever came back to her apartment.</i>

13:46.909 --> 13:48.079
<i>Instead, she vanished.</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:56.001
We don't know exactly
where Sister Catherine... was taken.

13:57.962 --> 14:02.052
You know, was she on her way back
from Edmondson Village?

14:02.133 --> 14:05.223
<i>Did she get back to the block</i>
<i>where she lived</i>

14:05.303 --> 14:07.513
<i>and then this person grabbed her?</i>

14:11.851 --> 14:15.401
<i>She might have been grabbed right outside</i>
<i>her own door for all we know.</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:23.324
<i>All we know is that she never came home</i>
<i>from that trip.</i>

14:26.199 --> 14:28.079
<i>We have a witness.</i>

14:28.159 --> 14:31.289
An airline stewardess
had gone grocery shopping

14:31.371 --> 14:35.171
and was going up and down from her car
carrying bags of groceries in and out.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.843
<i>But on the third trip, about 8:30,</i>

14:37.919 --> 14:41.839
<i>she remembers seeing Cathy</i>
<i>sitting in her car in the parking lot</i>

14:41.923 --> 14:43.883
<i>as if she was waiting for something.</i>

14:46.427 --> 14:48.137
<i>One of the Keough girls,</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:51.851
who was... embarrassed, I think,
initially to admit it,

14:52.683 --> 14:56.313
was in the neighborhood
of Sister Cathy's apartment that night.

14:56.979 --> 15:01.029
Um, she had a little bit of a crush
on one of the male teachers, I think,

15:01.109 --> 15:03.529
and was sort of hanging around
by his apartment,

15:03.611 --> 15:07.451
which was apparently a block or two away
from Cathy's apartment.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.746
It was the beginning of November,

15:16.833 --> 15:18.543
and around that time...

15:18.626 --> 15:21.626
our, um, new phonebooks came out
for the year.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.932
The-- It was called back then
the C&P Telephone Company.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.474
<i>I was a sophomore in high school.</i>

15:30.555 --> 15:33.385
<i>It was a Friday night,</i>
<i>and my girlfriend and I said:</i>

15:33.474 --> 15:36.734
"Let's look in the phonebook,
find out where all our teachers live."

15:39.105 --> 15:41.645
<i>In that house lived Mr. Noone,</i>

15:42.233 --> 15:44.743
<i>and the light was on, on the second floor.</i>

15:45.486 --> 15:50.736
And we said, "It's Mr. Noone!
He's got his undershirt on."

15:51.242 --> 15:54.082
I believe he was in the room there
above the door.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.630
<i>He was standing in front of a mirror,</i>
<i>combing his hair.</i>

16:02.920 --> 16:04.260
<i>The light went off.</i>

16:04.338 --> 16:07.258
<i>We ducked down</i>
<i>and, you know, trying not to giggle.</i>

16:08.551 --> 16:11.431
<i>Before we knew it, we heard this yelling.</i>

16:11.929 --> 16:15.139
And I would say
it came from that direction.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.478
<i>That's where Sister Cathy</i>
<i>and Sister Russell lived.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:24.396
<i>It was a man's voice.</i>

16:25.193 --> 16:27.703
<i>Loud, booming...</i>

16:28.863 --> 16:32.283
<i>garbled with emotion, anger.</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:38.411
We really thought it was some kind
of violence that was going on up there.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.589
<i>And that's when we took off and went home.</i>

17:00.895 --> 17:04.355
<i>Sister Russell, her roommate</i>
<i>and friend, became concerned</i>

17:04.440 --> 17:07.530
<i>when Cathy never came back</i>
<i>from the shopping trip.</i>

17:09.403 --> 17:11.863
<i>Around midnight,</i>
<i>she became concerned enough</i>

17:11.948 --> 17:15.828
<i>that she... called... Gerry Koob.</i>

17:18.204 --> 17:20.924
<i>Father Koob and Cathy had met.</i>

17:21.415 --> 17:22.875
<i>Cathy was teaching English,</i>

17:22.959 --> 17:26.169
<i>and Father Gerry Koob</i>
<i>was teaching religion.</i>

17:27.255 --> 17:29.625
<i>They apparently developed a friendship.</i>

17:31.801 --> 17:34.051
<i>That troubles us a bit, looking back.</i>

17:35.513 --> 17:38.723
<i>Why didn't Sister Russell call the police?</i>

17:43.688 --> 17:46.068
Now, the Carriage House
Apartments...

17:46.148 --> 17:48.608
- Right here.
- ...are here, yeah. Okay.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.487
Okay. Keep going. All right.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.655
Down here?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.495
Hmm.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.829
Go up a little further. Yeah.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.462
Before five o'clock that afternoon,
it was a typical day at the retreat house,

18:10.548 --> 18:12.838
and I didn't have a retreat going on,

18:13.634 --> 18:16.474
so, I have little or no recollection
of anything.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.564
But I knew that then-Brother Peter--

18:20.641 --> 18:23.481
Pete McKeon and I had decided

18:23.561 --> 18:26.771
<i>there's a movie playing in Baltimore</i>
<i>tonight that we both wanna see.</i>

18:30.151 --> 18:31.441
<i>It was</i> Easy Rider.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.237
<i>I would venture it must have been</i>
<i>about 10:30 or so by the time we got back.</i>

18:40.620 --> 18:42.460
<i>And we were sitting and talking about it</i>

18:42.913 --> 18:46.753
<i>and the phone rings,</i>
<i>and it's Sister Russell Phillips.</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:49.170
"Have you seen Cathy?"

18:53.174 --> 18:57.224
<i>She tells us that Cathy went out</i>
<i>around 8:00 or 8:30.</i>

18:58.054 --> 19:02.684
<i>She was gonna get an engagement present</i>
<i>for her sister and she's not home yet.</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:09.065
<i>So, we got in the car</i>
<i>and drove up to Catonsville immediately.</i>

19:12.652 --> 19:14.822
This is--
This is the apartment we were in.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.568
And, uh...

19:18.032 --> 19:19.532
we were on that ground floor.

19:21.952 --> 19:27.082
So, our approach was up those steps
and right into this apartment.

19:30.586 --> 19:35.046
<i>We spent maybe 45 minutes to an hour</i>
<i>listening to Russell.</i>

19:35.883 --> 19:40.893
<i>And... since it was now three hours</i>
<i>after what she expected,</i>

19:40.971 --> 19:43.471
<i>I said, "I think it's time for us</i>
<i>to call the police."</i>

19:49.397 --> 19:51.857
<i>So, a single policeman responded</i>
<i>to our call.</i>

19:51.941 --> 19:53.361
<i>He came to this apartment.</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:56.149
<i>We were describing her</i>
<i>as a missing person.</i>

19:57.905 --> 20:00.865
<i>He wrote everything down, he left.</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:04.374
<i>The three of us gathered</i>
<i>around a little table.</i>

20:05.579 --> 20:06.499
<i>And I said Mass.</i>

20:09.041 --> 20:13.301
<i>We did a little bread and wine,</i>
<i>and I did the Mass, a consecration.</i>

20:17.758 --> 20:21.388
<i>And we saved</i>
<i>some of the communion bread for Cathy.</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:26.518
<i>We were still hoping against hope</i>
<i>that she would show up.</i>

20:34.608 --> 20:37.108
<i>After another hour or two,</i>
<i>Peter and I left</i>

20:37.653 --> 20:39.993
<i>and went down those steps to take a walk.</i>

20:47.121 --> 20:48.711
We're coming up this way...

20:50.249 --> 20:54.709
and when we get about here...
we spot the car.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.841
<i>This door was unlocked.</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:00.835
<i>Right.</i>

21:00.926 --> 21:02.086
-We went in.
-Uh-huh.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.718
And the famous twig was sticking--
Hanging down from that.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.769
<i>There are leaves,</i>
<i>twigs, muddy tires.</i>

21:11.270 --> 21:15.780
<i>This car had been into a swampy area,</i>
<i>unquestionable.</i>

21:16.484 --> 21:20.244
The car had been
into swampy, muddy ground.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.332
<i>And why is that car found</i>

21:27.787 --> 21:30.407
<i>with its rear end sticking out</i>
<i>in the street</i>

21:30.498 --> 21:34.498
<i>right adjacent to the Carriage House</i>
<i>Apartments, where the nun lived?</i>

21:37.087 --> 21:41.177
Whoever put that car there
wanted it to be found.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.553
My elevator inside me
is dropping down very rapidly,

21:46.055 --> 21:50.135
because up here, I know
Cathy did not bring this car back here.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.307
Somebody else brought the car back
and didn't bring her with them.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.317
Then where is she?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.538
<i>Around this same period of time,</i>

22:10.037 --> 22:12.117
Joyce Malecki is a young woman

22:12.206 --> 22:16.836
who was abducted three or four days
after Sister Cathy was abducted.

22:19.964 --> 22:23.134
<i>Back then, abductions and murders</i>
<i>of random young women</i>

22:23.217 --> 22:24.887
<i>were almost unheard of.</i>

22:26.512 --> 22:32.022
<i>For two young women to be abducted</i>
<i>within four days of each other,</i>

22:32.101 --> 22:33.101
<i>what are the odds?</i>

22:35.145 --> 22:40.315
<i>Same scenario, car was found,</i>
<i>side of the road, door open, she was gone.</i>

22:41.819 --> 22:43.859
Her family are charming people.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.816
She has several siblings still alive.
We've met with them.

22:46.907 --> 22:51.577
So, we said, "As long as we're spending
this time looking around,

22:51.662 --> 22:54.712
let's see if we can find any information
to help the Maleckis."

22:58.669 --> 23:00.589
<i>This is where it had first came out</i>

23:00.671 --> 23:03.341
where she was missing
and where she was missing from.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.925
"Joyce Helen Malecki,

23:06.010 --> 23:10.510
a pretty young 20-year-old Lansdowne girl
who lived less than two miles

23:10.598 --> 23:13.178
from the apartment
where Sister Catherine Cesnik

23:13.267 --> 23:16.057
was reported missing late yesterday.

23:16.145 --> 23:21.315
Similarities in the two cases.
Both girls were young and attractive.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.740
Packages were found in both cars.

23:24.361 --> 23:29.241
<i>Both cars were found abandoned</i>
<i>with no apparent signs of struggle,</i>

23:29.325 --> 23:33.695
keys were still in the ignition,
and both girls had went shopping."

23:37.708 --> 23:42.548
You know, where we grew up,
we had no keys to the house.

23:42.630 --> 23:46.590
The house was not locked,
so, we could come and go as we please.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.681
There was no crime rate.
There was no trouble.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.182
<i>Never had any problems.</i>
<i>Everybody was there to help you.</i>

23:53.932 --> 23:55.982
<i>It was a nice neighborhood to grow up in.</i>

23:57.519 --> 24:00.059
<i>In November 1969,</i>

24:00.648 --> 24:04.358
I was working at Gino's,
which was a fast-food restaurant,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.993
<i>probably within five miles from the house.</i>

24:08.113 --> 24:12.833
<i>I was working in the evening,</i>
<i>and Joyce came up to Gino's</i>

24:12.910 --> 24:14.660
<i>and asked me to switch vehicles.</i>

24:16.038 --> 24:19.628
<i>She left her car,</i>
<i>and she took my parents' car.</i>

24:20.959 --> 24:23.209
<i>I was probably the last one to see her.</i>

24:30.344 --> 24:34.564
<i>This is the exact parking lot</i>
<i>where her car was found.</i>

24:35.516 --> 24:40.936
Once we converged here and met here,
we contacted the state police.

24:41.021 --> 24:45.441
<i>They responded rather rapidly,</i>
<i>secured the area</i>

24:46.360 --> 24:49.450
<i>and told us, you know,</i>
<i>"Hey, don't go in, don't touch nothing."</i>

24:50.322 --> 24:54.872
<i>The car is parked just the same</i>
<i>as we're parked right now,</i>

24:55.452 --> 24:58.332
and it was unlocked,
and the keys were in the ignition.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.752
<i>The day that my sister went out shopping</i>
<i>that evening,</i>

25:03.836 --> 25:08.916
<i>it was all over the local news</i>
<i>about Sister Cathy's disappearance.</i>

25:10.175 --> 25:15.505
<i>My mother told her,</i>
<i>"Joyce, be careful out there.</i>

25:15.597 --> 25:18.597
<i>The nun is missing.</i>
<i>Make sure you come home safe."</i>

25:20.185 --> 25:21.095
<i>But she didn't.</i>

25:42.666 --> 25:45.166
It's always like an interview
getting into your e-mail.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.965
<i>I sit right where I'm sitting now</i>
<i>in the evening,</i>

25:51.425 --> 25:53.545
<i>whether I'm eating or watching TV,</i>

25:53.635 --> 25:56.715
<i>and I read everybody's posts.</i>

25:57.765 --> 25:59.095
<i>Abbie's the researcher.</i>

26:00.601 --> 26:03.811
<i>She and I are on here every night</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:06.767
<i>This Facebook page,</i>

26:06.857 --> 26:10.397
<i>Justice for Catherine Cesnik</i>
<i>and Joyce Malecki...</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:16.660
<i>Abbie Fitzgerald and I</i>
<i>are the administrators on this page.</i>

26:17.534 --> 26:21.794
And the purpose of the page
is to collect information

26:21.872 --> 26:26.672
from anybody who might have information
about what happened to Sister Cathy.

26:28.295 --> 26:33.625
<i>We have journalists, law enforcement,</i>
<i>retired police officers.</i>

26:34.259 --> 26:36.969
<i>People know</i>
<i>that they can private message us.</i>

26:38.263 --> 26:41.063
<i>If I ask a question tonight on this page,</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:45.810
<i>all we have to do is post it</i>
<i>and we get so many responses.</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:53.954
This is my very inelegant file
system, very low-tech.

26:55.322 --> 26:59.792
But it became clear fairly early
that so many names were coming up

27:00.619 --> 27:05.039
that I needed some way to try
to store the information, find it again.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.791
Let's see.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.915
I have the letters
to the City of Baltimore Police,

27:13.006 --> 27:18.176
to the... CIA, the FBI,
Freedom of Information Act request.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.059
Okay.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.716
This Facebook post is from May.

27:23.350 --> 27:27.480
"We went on a field trip
trying to better understand the events

27:27.563 --> 27:30.483
the evening Sister Cathy was abducted.

27:30.566 --> 27:35.146
Picture is attached.
Tan brick building was Cathy's apartment.

27:35.237 --> 27:39.577
Parking lot next to that
is where her car would have been parked.

27:39.658 --> 27:44.248
A silver SUV is parked
where her car was found,

27:44.329 --> 27:48.419
parked illegally with back of car
protruding into the street."

27:49.626 --> 27:53.796
<i>Facebook has been such an integral part</i>
<i>of our investigation.</i>

27:53.881 --> 27:55.801
<i>There's power in numbers,</i>

27:55.883 --> 28:00.143
<i>and we're all feeling driven</i>
<i>to find out who hurt Sister Cathy.</i>

28:00.929 --> 28:04.639
Sister Cathy and Joyce went missing
in the same area

28:04.725 --> 28:07.435
of southwest Baltimore in the same week.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.939
So, we've been working
with the Malecki family

28:10.022 --> 28:12.442
to try and get information about Joyce

28:12.524 --> 28:16.364
and to try and make connections
between the two murders

28:16.445 --> 28:19.275
and the people
that we think were responsible.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.700
Okay, Buddy, let's go.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.012
<i>After we found Joyce's car,</i>

28:39.092 --> 28:42.762
<i>it was the next day</i>
<i>that two hunters found her body.</i>

28:45.766 --> 28:48.266
<i>Well, you can see how secluded this is.</i>

28:49.102 --> 28:51.272
<i>And like I said, at the time,</i>
<i>it was a dirt road,</i>

28:51.355 --> 28:53.225
<i>so, somebody had to know</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:55.902
where they were going
and what they were doing.

28:56.902 --> 29:01.242
And in my opinion, she was placed
back here not to be found any time soon.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.422
And somewhere--
Somewhere back in here,

29:12.167 --> 29:14.747
you go back about 25, 30 yards,

29:14.836 --> 29:19.376
and there's the Little Patuxent River,
and that's where her body was found.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.137
<i>And they asked</i>
<i>if someone would identify.</i>

29:30.143 --> 29:32.903
And my mother and father,
they were too upset.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.607
So, I said, "Well, I'll go back."

29:37.276 --> 29:38.896
<i>So that they would be spared that.</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:04.635
<i>The hunters found her.</i>

30:04.720 --> 30:09.310
<i>She was facedown in the stream</i>
<i>with her hands tied behind her back.</i>

30:11.435 --> 30:12.475
<i>And her throat was cut.</i>

30:15.230 --> 30:19.320
<i>They had her body on this gurney</i>
<i>and a sheet over her.</i>

30:20.277 --> 30:23.777
<i>And just the one thing</i>
<i>I'll never ever forget,</i>

30:23.864 --> 30:25.244
<i>when they pulled the sheet back,</i>

30:27.159 --> 30:32.959
her face was all dirty and muddy,
and... her hair had sticks in it.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.539
But I could still tell it was my sister.

30:39.379 --> 30:43.219
<i>So, that's when I went back</i>
<i>and I... told my mother and father</i>

30:43.300 --> 30:45.510
<i>and Donald and Darryl that it was her.</i>

30:49.473 --> 30:50.933
<i>But when it comes to my sister,</i>

30:51.016 --> 30:52.788
<i>the only thing I can
see is what I saw</i>

30:52.800 --> 30:54.766
<i>when I-- When they
pulled that sheet back.</i>

30:55.312 --> 30:57.154
<i>That's terrible.
That's the only memory</i>

30:57.166 --> 30:59.112
<i>that I have, and it
never ever goes away.</i>

31:00.192 --> 31:02.032
It's just like it was yesterday.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.195
So, that's...

31:05.697 --> 31:11.447
That's what you have to go through,
I guess, in a situation like that, but...

31:13.330 --> 31:16.120
That's why I would like
to see somebody pay for it.

31:17.751 --> 31:18.791
Somebody did it.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.053
<i>"City police search for missing nun,</i>

31:28.136 --> 31:32.306
<i>26 officers combing area</i>
<i>with K-9 corps dogs."</i>

31:32.849 --> 31:36.229
<i>It was a huge public event in 1969.</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:39.521
<i>We've got a terrible-- Nun disappeared.</i>
<i>It's all over the front page.</i>

31:40.232 --> 31:42.942
<i>And five days later, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what's happened to Malecki?</i>

31:43.026 --> 31:44.146
<i>Are they connected?"</i>

31:44.236 --> 31:47.526
<i>And the FBI commissioner,</i>
<i>the head guy in Baltimore, anyway,</i>

31:47.614 --> 31:52.124
<i>tells the press, "Rest assured,</i>
<i>your Federal FBI is hard at work.</i>

31:52.202 --> 31:58.172
We will find out if there's a connection
between Malecki and Sister Cathy."

31:59.000 --> 32:03.550
You start asking,
"Who ran that investigation?"

32:04.631 --> 32:06.681
And that's Captain John Barnold.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.434
<i>He's the chief of Homicide,</i>
<i>Baltimore City cops.</i>

32:14.266 --> 32:18.226
"We're coming in here a minute,
hon, and take a few pictures."

32:22.023 --> 32:23.483
That was me in my good days.

32:24.276 --> 32:28.356
It was just a photo taken with
my new captain's hat and badge and all.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.620
I was 38. I was the youngest captain
on the force at the time.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.907
And at that time, they only had...

32:36.496 --> 32:40.706
I think it was 18 captains
in the whole force, and I was one of 18.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.337
I was fortunate. I had a good career.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.838
People are missing every day.

32:46.923 --> 32:50.643
They wander off, you know, and--
And, usually, nothing comes of it.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.219
As a matter of fact, in the newspapers,
they quote me--

32:53.805 --> 32:56.215
<i>No foul play was known at the time.</i>

32:58.059 --> 33:01.439
And they kept coming to us, "Did you hear
anything? Did you do anything?"

33:01.980 --> 33:05.730
Uh, they'd come to me and I'd say,
"The investigation is still on. I--"

33:06.526 --> 33:07.986
<i>That was all I could tell them.</i>

33:12.073 --> 33:15.293
<i>From day one,</i>
<i>Barnold is essentially telling everybody:</i>

33:15.368 --> 33:17.313
"We don't think it's kidnapping.
We don't

33:17.325 --> 33:19.328
see a problem. We're okay.
We'll be fine."

33:19.873 --> 33:21.963
"What's going on here? Where is she?"

33:22.417 --> 33:25.047
"We can't find her. We don't know.
Nobody knows."

33:27.339 --> 33:28.719
<i>I didn't wanna seem evasive,</i>

33:28.798 --> 33:32.838
<i>but as I said,</i>
<i>I was supervising robberies, homicides.</i>

33:32.928 --> 33:37.348
We were averaging 200 homicides a year
even then in Baltimore City.

33:37.891 --> 33:42.271
So, with 200 homicides,
numerous assaults, sex offenses,

33:43.063 --> 33:46.733
I couldn't really devote my time
to one specific case.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.112
<i>I just had to trust my supervisors,</i>
<i>my lieutenants and sergeants</i>

33:51.196 --> 33:52.356
<i>to get the work done.</i>

33:54.908 --> 33:57.738
The longer she was missing,
the more we suspected foul play,

33:57.827 --> 33:59.957
but you don't wanna advertise it either.

34:00.872 --> 34:05.752
<i>With the disappearance of Sister Cesnik</i>
<i>and the disappearance of Joyce Malecki,</i>

34:05.835 --> 34:11.165
<i>and both of them being young</i>
<i>white females, attractive, shopping,</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:15.007
and nobody could give an excuse,
under those circumstances,

34:15.637 --> 34:18.755
you have to... go
with the possibility

34:18.766 --> 34:22.137
that there has been
serious consequences,

34:22.226 --> 34:25.357
that there may have been a kidnapping
or a murder.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.333
I remember going back to school
and everybody just shaking their heads,

34:43.415 --> 34:46.125
because nobody could believe
that she would disappear.

34:47.252 --> 34:51.262
<i>It's hard to describe how you feel</i>
<i>when you know somebody's in trouble</i>

34:51.339 --> 34:53.219
<i>and there's nothing you can do about it.</i>

34:53.967 --> 34:56.677
Like, how can Cathy be kidnapped?

34:56.761 --> 34:58.141
That doesn't make sense.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.965
None of it made sense.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.650
<i>As school went on from November</i>
<i>into the Christmas time,</i>

35:06.605 --> 35:10.145
<i>I kind of think we all thought</i>
<i>she'd never be found.</i>

35:11.943 --> 35:14.573
<i>We knew</i>
<i>there was an investigation going on,</i>

35:14.654 --> 35:16.914
<i>but it wasn't visible to us anymore.</i>

35:17.282 --> 35:19.992
<i>We didn't see pictures</i>
<i>of people looking in the fields</i>

35:20.076 --> 35:25.286
<i>and people with dogs out looking</i>
<i>for the presence of Cathy Cesnik.</i>

35:27.208 --> 35:31.918
<i>We had so many questions, and we didn't</i>
<i>think we were gonna get any answers.</i>

35:49.898 --> 35:53.278
<i>From November the 7th</i>
<i>until mid-January,</i>

35:54.194 --> 35:56.074
<i>I had no idea what happened to Cathy.</i>

35:57.906 --> 35:58.736
<i>And...</i>

36:01.034 --> 36:04.834
what I learned from that
is the imagination goes crazy...

36:06.665 --> 36:08.745
'cause you imagine it two different ways.

36:08.833 --> 36:14.263
You imagine in a way that keeps her alive,
because you want her to be alive.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.093
But then what do you plug into that?

36:17.801 --> 36:20.141
She's being held captive.
She's being tortured.

36:20.220 --> 36:23.600
She's being repressed.
And that gets too hard to bear.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.859
<i>So, then you start going the other way.</i>
<i>"Let's imagine that she's dead."</i>

36:32.273 --> 36:33.823
<i>I don't want-- I don't want that.</i>

36:37.153 --> 36:41.073
<i>So, that was a very black period</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

36:50.583 --> 36:57.343
<i>"The body of 26-year-old Catherine</i>
<i>Cesnik was found January 3rd, 1970,</i>

36:57.424 --> 36:59.844
<i>in southwest Baltimore County.</i>

37:02.011 --> 37:04.811
<i>She was lying on her back</i>
<i>on the slope of a little hill.</i>

37:05.306 --> 37:09.806
Sister Cathy wound up on the garbage dump
with her skull caved in."

37:23.908 --> 37:27.078
<i>I can remember</i>
<i>I was leaning against a wall</i>

37:27.162 --> 37:30.172
<i>when somebody was telling me</i>
<i>that they found the body.</i>

37:31.458 --> 37:35.548
<i>And I remember sliding my back</i>
<i>down the wall to sit on the floor.</i>

37:37.046 --> 37:39.216
<i>And mostly, the feeling was relief.</i>

37:42.510 --> 37:43.340
Now...

37:44.637 --> 37:47.137
Now the waiting
to find out what happened is over.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.610
<i>James Scannell is a retired</i>

38:00.320 --> 38:04.120
<i>Baltimore County policeman, okay?</i>

38:05.325 --> 38:06.905
<i>Wonderful reputation.</i>

38:07.535 --> 38:09.115
<i>Was involved</i>

38:09.204 --> 38:13.084
<i>at the time that Sister Cathy's body</i>
<i>was discovered in Lansdowne,</i>

38:13.792 --> 38:18.462
took the call from the hunters
who reported it and went out.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.296
He was the first officer on the scene.

38:21.382 --> 38:26.642
He has agreed to take us to the spot
where Cathy's body was found.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.266
Alan Horn contacted him.

38:30.183 --> 38:34.103
<i>Yeah, Alan Horn is</i>
<i>a very helpful man</i>

38:34.187 --> 38:39.027
<i>who approached us</i>
<i>through our public justice Facebook site.</i>

38:39.609 --> 38:45.739
Um, he told us that he was mostly retired,

38:45.824 --> 38:48.584
that he didn't like to go fishing,

38:49.452 --> 38:54.622
and that as a hobby, he helped groups
by doing research for them.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.667
<i>We didn't know much about Alan.</i>

38:56.751 --> 39:00.881
<i>He came onto our Facebook page</i>
<i>and started posting.</i>

39:01.631 --> 39:06.511
<i>Alan is great with talking to families,</i>
<i>making cold calls</i>

39:06.594 --> 39:11.644
to find out who's connected to whom
and to reach out to people that we were--

39:11.724 --> 39:15.814
really felt like would be instrumental
in giving us information and--

39:15.895 --> 39:17.515
But we weren't sure how to do it.

39:33.830 --> 39:39.090
I have a lot of doubts about Scannell,
but he doesn't need to know that.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.423
I'm Alan Horn.

39:44.674 --> 39:45.514
Thank you.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.968
<i>I will do my part</i>
<i>to make him feel comfortable</i>

39:50.054 --> 39:52.644
<i>and honor what he's sharing with us.</i>

39:53.766 --> 39:57.056
Hi, I was one of--
I was one of Cathy's students.

39:57.145 --> 40:00.895
- Oh, okay.
- So, it means a lot to me to meet you,

40:00.982 --> 40:05.652
and I can't tell you how much that means,
so, thank you for--

40:05.737 --> 40:07.407
-No problem.
-For sharing with us.

40:07.488 --> 40:08.698
-Yeah.
-I really mean that.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.077
She meant everything to me, so...

40:11.200 --> 40:14.330
But I'm actually looking and listening
for other signs...

40:15.830 --> 40:19.710
<i>so, I will know</i>
<i>what I'm going to do and say and--</i>

40:20.460 --> 40:21.630
<i>When I get there.</i>

40:26.549 --> 40:30.759
<i>I'm Jim Scannell,</i>
<i>law enforcement for 38 years.</i>

40:31.971 --> 40:34.681
<i>I worked</i>
<i>just about all over Baltimore County.</i>

40:35.433 --> 40:37.273
Well, I was the lieutenant on duty...

40:38.102 --> 40:41.022
in Halethorpe
at the time the body was found.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.068
And as the lieutenant, I responded.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.069
<i>I met the officer at the scene.</i>

40:47.153 --> 40:50.373
<i>He took me to an area</i>
<i>to the right side of the road.</i>

40:51.032 --> 40:55.162
It was a small plot where they probably
burned trash or something like that.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.865
And it wasn't a big dump

40:57.956 --> 41:02.536
or anything like-- Just what would
you find in a normal household

41:02.627 --> 41:06.167
or community
where, you know, they get rid of debris.

41:07.048 --> 41:07.918
I can still--

41:09.217 --> 41:10.217
Still see the--

41:10.718 --> 41:12.848
Her laying on the ground,
laying on her back.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.769
It stays with you, you know?
You never forget it.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.096
But it...

41:19.560 --> 41:22.060
It's part of your job,
and you accept it, I guess.

41:23.106 --> 41:26.146
And the question is, was she dumped there?
Was she murdered there?

41:26.651 --> 41:27.901
What transpired?

41:28.236 --> 41:32.486
Prior to that, it was, I guess,
almost two months, but, uh...

41:34.659 --> 41:38.449
If they haven't changed the terrain,
I think I can get back there again.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.225
This one here.

42:07.942 --> 42:08.782
Right here.

42:13.906 --> 42:14.736
<i>We were here.</i>

42:16.367 --> 42:19.787
<i>So, it was a good 20 yards off the road,</i>
<i>where the body was.</i>

42:25.168 --> 42:27.128
<i>She was just laying there on her back,</i>

42:27.211 --> 42:30.631
and her clothes were stripped down
to her waist.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.804
<i>Her purse was laying alongside of her.</i>

42:36.179 --> 42:39.719
<i>Condition of the body indicated</i>
<i>that she was there for a while.</i>

42:41.476 --> 42:42.556
<i>No fresh blood.</i>

42:43.227 --> 42:47.607
<i>She wasn't shot.</i>
<i>She wasn't stabbed... that I could see.</i>

42:51.944 --> 42:54.164
I think probably she was dumped there,

42:54.906 --> 42:58.326
<i>just dumped out of the car</i>
<i>and laying there on her back.</i>

43:00.286 --> 43:01.656
<i>She hadn't deteriorated.</i>

43:03.206 --> 43:06.036
No maggots or anything like that.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.925
I just wanna say goodbye to you

43:21.015 --> 43:23.765
- and thank you for your help today.
- Oh, okay. No problem.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.271
We're really sorry
we dragged you all over tarnation.

43:26.354 --> 43:30.324
-Sorry it didn't turn out better.
-No. I mean, it's not a happy thing to do.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.779
-Because I was one of her students...
-Uh-huh.

43:32.860 --> 43:36.360
...I just feel like I need to know as much
as I can about what happened to her.

43:38.199 --> 43:43.079
Well, between... her disappearance
and there,

43:43.621 --> 43:45.251
that's where the answer lies.

43:46.791 --> 43:50.631
Everything in between
is only known by the guy who did it.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.591
- Can I ask you one more question?
- Yeah.

43:52.672 --> 43:56.882
Was it your gut instinct that
she had been moved several times maybe

43:56.968 --> 43:58.508
before she was left there?

44:00.179 --> 44:02.639
They would probably know
once they moved the body.

44:02.723 --> 44:03.683
They what?

44:03.766 --> 44:05.056
Once they moved the body.

44:05.768 --> 44:09.938
Other words, I-- I could just base
my observation on what I've seen.

44:10.022 --> 44:12.152
-Because she was laying on her back?
-Yeah.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.693
-Bud Roemer was there.
-Right.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.146
-Baltimore City detectives were there.
-Right.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.237
Do you remember any of their names?

44:18.322 --> 44:20.782
- Just Bud Roemer, and he's dead.
- Bud, and he's gone.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.742
When we were at your house,

44:22.827 --> 44:25.907
you told me some information.
I wanted to ask you about it again.

44:25.997 --> 44:32.627
You said it might be possible
to get the report from the patrol officer.

44:32.712 --> 44:36.632
And who would we call to do that
besides you?

44:36.716 --> 44:38.506
Have to call headquarters.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.263
Do you know anybody that we--?

44:40.344 --> 44:42.644
Do you have any friends
in the police department?

44:42.722 --> 44:44.642
Most of them are retired, dead.

44:44.724 --> 44:47.984
You wouldn't wanna make that call for me
if I treat you to a crab cake?

44:48.060 --> 44:49.650
I don't think they'd know me.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.649
Truthful, they wouldn't know me.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.610
I bet they would.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.230
The people would.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.568
- You look like Paul Newman.
- Is that what it was?

44:57.653 --> 44:59.743
The blue eyes and the beard. Yeah.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.406
- Okay.
- That's all.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.080
-Gory stuff, huh?
-Yeah.

45:03.159 --> 45:04.659
-Again, thank you.
-Okay.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.365
-I appreciate your help.
-Alrighty.

45:06.454 --> 45:07.294
Okay.

45:25.348 --> 45:28.598
<i>"Bud Roemer</i>

<i>off Monumental Avenue.</i>

45:48.621 --> 45:52.001

unmarked black Plymouths

near her apartment.</i>

47:24.216 --> 47:27.886
<i>In all likelihood, the unknown assailant</i>
<i>had then killed the nun</i>

47:28.304 --> 47:30.724
<i>and dumped her body</i>
<i>about five miles away.</i>

47:35.644 --> 47:38.944
<i>But his hypothesis was contradicted</i>
<i>by one troubling fact.</i>

47:40.441 --> 47:46.661
<i>The nun's car, a green 1969 Ford Maverick,</i>
<i>had been parked at an odd angle,</i>

47:47.198 --> 47:51.368
<i>illegally,</i>
<i>near her Carriage House apartment complex</i>

47:51.452 --> 47:54.712
<i>only a few hours after she drove off</i>
<i>to the shopping center.</i>

47:56.332 --> 48:00.672
<i>How had the dead woman's Ford</i>
<i>gotten back to her apartment complex?</i>

48:03.005 --> 48:06.125
<i>In that situation, the killer wants</i>
<i>to get the hell away from there.</i>

48:06.509 --> 48:08.889
<i>Last thing he wants</i>
<i>is to return to the area</i>

48:08.969 --> 48:11.679
<i>where he might be spotted</i>
<i>driving the victim's car."</i>

48:15.643 --> 48:17.273
<i>Yeah, with the Sister Cesnik case,</i>

48:17.353 --> 48:19.693
<i>until the body was found</i>
<i>two months later...</i>

48:20.356 --> 48:23.816
<i>during the interim,</i>
<i>we investigated numerous people,</i>

48:23.901 --> 48:25.951
<i>anybody that could have been involved</i>
<i>with her.</i>

48:26.028 --> 48:29.698
Students, friends, her roommate,
the place she worked at.

48:32.868 --> 48:34.448
<i>She was an attractive woman.</i>

48:35.037 --> 48:38.997
It could have been somebody
just living in that area... followed her

48:39.083 --> 48:42.593
<i>or stopped her car or waved her down</i>
<i>where her car was found.</i>

48:45.506 --> 48:46.966
<i>Somebody put the car there.</i>

48:47.591 --> 48:51.851
And, yeah, it would have been
so much easier if whoever killed her

48:51.929 --> 48:55.019
just dumped the car somewhere in the woods
where she was.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.265
With homicides, time is a destroyer.

49:02.898 --> 49:05.358
In other words,
you could see the bodies decompose.

49:05.442 --> 49:09.662
Blood work disintegrates.
Weather washes things away.

49:10.322 --> 49:14.292
<i>And the longer you wait,</i>
<i>the harder it is to get good evidence.</i>

49:16.871 --> 49:18.081
<i>There's so many scenarios.</i>

49:18.164 --> 49:21.754
<i>You know, you can really go wild</i>
<i>trying to find out different things.</i>

49:33.679 --> 49:34.969
<i>We have two facts.</i>

49:36.557 --> 49:38.477
She was abducted and she was killed.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.361
Beyond that,
I don't know exactly what we have.

49:45.024 --> 49:50.034
And the cops always told us that there
was no forensic evidence in that car...

49:51.363 --> 49:54.163
but the fact of where the car
was parked...

49:54.992 --> 49:58.622
combined with the fact
of where her body was found

49:58.704 --> 49:59.874
<i>some months later...</i>

50:00.915 --> 50:03.915
<i>is a detail that's always</i>
<i>been stuck in my throat.</i>

50:06.754 --> 50:09.424
<i>Because where her body was found...</i>

50:10.507 --> 50:14.257
was not an area
where you would just casually drive by it

50:14.929 --> 50:17.599
and say, "Oh, here's a good place
to dump a body."

50:19.099 --> 50:21.389
<i>But this was a very out-of-the-way area...</i>

50:22.937 --> 50:26.647
<i>which led me to believe that it was</i>
<i>somebody who knew that area very well.</i>

50:29.652 --> 50:31.702
<i>We went into this</i>
<i>collecting information.</i>

50:31.779 --> 50:33.319
<i>We said, "We don't know what happened.</i>

50:33.405 --> 50:35.603
Let's collect every
little bit of scrap,

50:35.615 --> 50:37.825
listen to every story
somebody tells us,

50:37.910 --> 50:40.540
and when we feel
like we've hit a dead end,

50:40.621 --> 50:43.121
we'll sit down
and go through all this and say:

50:43.207 --> 50:45.127
"What direction is this pointing us in?"

50:45.834 --> 50:47.999
This is not Abbie and
Gemma sitting at a

50:48.011 --> 50:50.134
table being detectives
or playing Clue.

50:50.798 --> 50:55.338
<i>It's wrong. It's wrong what's happened,</i>
<i>but they're still unsolved.</i>

50:55.427 --> 50:59.057
<i>We need justice for Cathy Cesnik</i>
<i>and Joyce Malecki.</i>

51:00.599 --> 51:02.479
<i>I have this image of myself in a room</i>

51:02.559 --> 51:06.189
with all these wires hanging down,
all these electric wires,

51:06.272 --> 51:07.822
and none of them are connecting.

51:09.191 --> 51:14.951
<i>I'm tentatively optimistic,</i>
<i>but I'm impatient for connections.</i>

51:19.910 --> 51:23.040
<i>I've been pursuing this</i>
<i>for the last 15 years.</i>

51:24.290 --> 51:27.000
I've been calling FBI and--

51:27.084 --> 51:30.384
Time in and time out.
And I get the same answers.

51:30.462 --> 51:33.722
I visited them.
I went and knocked on their door.

51:33.799 --> 51:36.429
"What have you done
in the last 15, 20 years?"

51:37.177 --> 51:39.927
<i>And the only thing they tell me is:</i>

51:40.014 --> 51:42.434
<i>"It's an open case</i>
<i>and we cannot discuss it."</i>

51:43.434 --> 51:47.984
<i>It almost leads me, personally,</i>
<i>to believe it's a cover-up,</i>

51:48.647 --> 51:50.767
<i>because I can't get any information.</i>

51:51.275 --> 51:53.435
You know,
and here's two big flags that go up,

51:54.111 --> 51:56.321
<i>and both of them are unresolved.</i>

51:57.072 --> 51:58.992
It's awful coincidental.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.949
Even if they come out and say,
"We don't have anything,"

52:04.038 --> 52:06.078
at least they would be talking.

52:06.165 --> 52:07.365
They won't even do that.

52:09.626 --> 52:11.166
You know, Baltimore is...

52:13.922 --> 52:18.182
Has its level of corruption,
and it's got its hierarchy.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.979
<i>A retired detective</i>
<i>that I interviewed frequently</i>

52:25.059 --> 52:27.479
<i>who worked on it often says to me:</i>

52:27.561 --> 52:32.111
<i>"Nugent, the real problem here</i>
<i>is the cover-up itself.</i>

52:32.608 --> 52:36.738
The cover-up itself is the cancer
inside Baltimore."

52:44.661 --> 52:45.951
This is where she's buried.

52:51.043 --> 52:53.503
<i>My sister Joyce and Sister Cathy.</i>

52:53.587 --> 52:56.917
<i>They were put on this Earth</i>
<i>same as the rest of us.</i>

52:57.007 --> 53:01.297
<i>Somebody needs to come out in the open</i>
<i>and acknowledge the fact</i>

53:01.387 --> 53:03.347
<i>that this is how they were taken away.</i>

53:05.682 --> 53:06.892
<i>This was somebody's life,</i>

53:06.975 --> 53:10.515
<i>and people are ready to just say,</i>
<i>"Oh, well," and move on to the next thing.</i>

53:10.938 --> 53:12.728
It's never sat right with me.

53:13.190 --> 53:17.530
So, when I saw that there were other women
that were like:

53:17.611 --> 53:19.821
<i>"We wanna find out</i>
<i>who killed Sister Cathy,"</i>

53:20.447 --> 53:25.447
<i>you know, retired women, grandmothers</i>
<i>that haven't let go of this...</i>

53:26.745 --> 53:28.455
<i>And Tom Nugent, who--</i>

53:28.539 --> 53:33.879
<i>This has been his lifelong pursuit, right,</i>
<i>since he first heard about it.</i>

53:35.796 --> 53:38.716
We're at a point now
where we're not gonna let it go.

53:40.217 --> 53:44.137
We're gonna do whatever it is
we need to do to get justice.

53:48.809 --> 53:51.809
<i>So, how does this story begin?</i>

53:56.024 --> 53:59.074
<i>There are two key characters</i>
<i>in this sad story.</i>

54:00.821 --> 54:03.201
<i>One is a murdered nun, Sister Cathy.</i>

54:05.200 --> 54:07.700
<i>The other is the witness, Jane Doe...</i>

54:12.374 --> 54:15.754
<i>a student at the Catholic high school</i>
<i>where Sister Cathy taught.</i>

54:17.880 --> 54:21.050
<i>There was a mystery</i>
<i>around Jane Doe's identity.</i>

54:23.010 --> 54:27.600
<i>Everything starts there,</i>
<i>and everything still hinges there.</i>

54:29.349 --> 54:32.849
<i>Jane Doe probably knows</i>
<i>exactly what happened,</i>

54:32.936 --> 54:39.816
<i>and it has taken her 45 years to gradually</i>
<i>confront the full horror in herself.</i>

54:42.863 --> 54:44.033
Who is Jane Doe?

54:45.574 --> 54:46.704
Jane Doe?

54:48.118 --> 54:49.998
I'd love to talk to her now...

54:51.538 --> 54:56.038
'cause she had a story to tell,
but we never got to hear it.
