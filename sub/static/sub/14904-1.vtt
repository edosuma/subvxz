02:58.920 --> 03:05.075
- What did you say?
- I was on the ocean in a boat.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.390
It was a dream.

03:12.440 --> 03:17.036
That's the third time
you've had that dream this month.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.993
Do you think the new site
for the missile platform is a lock?

03:28.200 --> 03:33.274
Van Gelder thinks so. With any luck,
we'll be home in a week.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.358
That's good, I'm ready.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.111
What are you gonna do
when we get out of here?

03:41.320 --> 03:45.313
Hang out with Laidlaw's family
till I get a new assignment.

03:45.520 --> 03:50.435
- The Captain's got a great wife.
- Great wife, great kids.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.428
The Captain, he's got it made.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.197
How come you never got married?

04:02.440 --> 04:05.910
It's too early
for this kind of conversation.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.317
No, really, why did you never
get married?

04:14.480 --> 04:19.507
I've never been in one place
long enough.

04:21.839 --> 04:26.231
We've gotten pretty close
the last couple of months.

04:26.440 --> 04:31.639
Get any closer,
we'd wear each other's shorts.

04:31.840 --> 04:38.154
It's different with you.
You're like one of the guys.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.798
Is your stomach still bothering you?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.276
I think it's that dried-outjunk
we had last night.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.313
Have Dr. Norris examine you.

05:15.520 --> 05:21.436
- I'm just tired of the food.
- Me, too. I'd kill for a Big Mac.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.270
- Locking collar? Umbilicals?
- Clear.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.358
Get ready to detach.

06:07.640 --> 06:13.033
This is about the twentieth time
I've read this magazine.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.950
- I'd like to see a new movie.
- How about breathing fresh air?

06:18.160 --> 06:22.199
Six months at the bottom of the ocean
is more than I bargained for.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.915
- Peace is our profession.
- Exactly.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.873
There she blows.
Transponder contact, 550 metres.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.710
- Reduce speed.
- DSRV-2 to Seatrak, come in.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.754
<i>- This is Seatrak. Go, Richardson.
- We're on the turnpike.</i>

06:40.960 --> 06:44.635
<i>About time, the shift change
was 20 minutes ago.</i>

06:44.840 --> 06:50.358
Good morning to you, too, Snyder.
Put a candle in the window for us.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.917
<i>Work lights on,
homing beacon activated.</i>

07:43.000 --> 07:49.394
- Collar in place, umbilicals locked.
- Pressure steady. Airlock purge.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.673
Hodges! Come on.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.634
Time to make the world
a better place.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.628
- See you later.
- Bet on it.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.788
- Welcome aboard.
- Always a pleasure.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.549
- Johnny, my man. What it be like?
- Another day in paradise.

08:12.760 --> 08:17.231
- I left something in your video.
- Are we talking Miss September?

08:17.440 --> 08:20.955
Is it hot? Is it wet? Is it smooth?

08:27.160 --> 08:32.075
Good morning.
I see you've been very busy.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.239
Snyder and I have drifted the missile
sled over the site last night.

08:36.440 --> 08:42.515
- We just stabilized the platform.
- And I calculated the new trajectory.

08:42.720 --> 08:48.033
Good. When you finish, have Collins
and her men anchor the platform.

08:48.240 --> 08:53.519
- We have to do the sounding first.
- That's not necessary.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.359
This area is stable.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.599
But even the smallest geological
defect can cause instability...

09:00.800 --> 09:05.920
I don't want to see a stray missile
hitting some nice house.

09:06.120 --> 09:10.830
Very well, take some soundings.
I'll get Collins to start excavating.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.430
- Wait till I get the soundings.
- I don't have time to wait.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.279
You have your orders.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.874
- All set to go, Doc?
- Any time you're ready.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.993
- Snyder, secure that hatch.
- Securing the hatch.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.673
DSRV-2 to Seatrak.
We are secure for departure.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.871
- Morning, campers.
- Morning, Captain.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.799
- Snyder, would you slow down?
- You worried about my health?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.037
- You're making me sick.
- Weren't we out of oatmeal?

10:17.240 --> 10:20.994
- That's eggs.
- Not eating, Scarpelli?

10:21.200 --> 10:25.352
No, I've got some work to finish.

10:25.560 --> 10:30.350
I want you to take the day off.
That's an order.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.473
Great, after breakfast
I could help you with a few sets.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.638
No, you fix the leak
in the docking bay.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.150
And after that,
you fix the starter in DRSV-1.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.830
- But after that...
- You report to me.

10:45.040 --> 10:49.158
I said it was Scarpelli's day off,
not yours.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.633
That sound always
gives me the creeps.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.435
It's just adjusting to the pressure.

10:59.640 --> 11:05.397
- Snyder, call Collins for me.
- Can I finish eating first?

11:05.600 --> 11:09.878
- You just talked to her...
- Damn it, Snyder!

11:10.080 --> 11:15.518
A guy can't even finish breakfast
around here. Let's go.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.596
<i>- Now he needs a day off.
- More like a month.</i>

11:27.800 --> 11:32.271
<i>Bullpen, this is Deepstar.
Please, acknowledge.</i>

11:32.480 --> 11:35.517
- Go ahead.
- How's it going?

11:35.720 --> 11:38.393
Switch to video, please.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.558
- She's all yours.
- I want a progress report.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.912
Nothing to report. I've ordered
Hodges and Osborne to stop digging.

11:46.120 --> 11:50.432
Burciaga noticed
some unusual soundings.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.437
We think there's a cavern
under the site.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.599
- Better take a look at it.
- No, I'm not going to waste time.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.588
It's too late to change sites.
The Navy would shut us down.

12:03.800 --> 12:09.875
<i>They'll do that anyway. You can't
place a missile sled over a cavern.</i>

12:10.080 --> 12:13.993
Collapse it with explosives,
and put the sled on top.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.158
<i>According to the soundings,
the cavern is pretty deep.</i>

12:17.360 --> 12:21.319
I don't care how deep it is!
Blow it up if you have to.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.991
I want that missile sled in place
before the end of the week.

12:29.760 --> 12:33.753
<i>I think he likes you, Collins.
Have a nice day.</i>

12:35.520 --> 12:41.629
What ajerk.
Seatrak to Seacat, come in.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.236
Prepare an explosives package
right away.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.991
- My eggs are cold.
- Put it in the microwave.

12:59.880 --> 13:04.829
- That doesn't sound right.
- The rotor's jammed.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.199
- Borrow that pen for a second?
- Help yourself...

13:13.720 --> 13:18.840
There we go, that's got it.
Here.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.032
<i>- What was wrong with your pen?
- Nothing.</i>

13:22.240 --> 13:25.994
I don't stick it in garbage disposals.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.630
- Fuel report you requested.
- Thanks, Mac.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.639
- You have the duty roster, Snyder?
- It's on your desk, Captain.

13:41.840 --> 13:47.517
- Did you get your work assignments?
- Yeah, I'm on top of it.

13:47.720 --> 13:52.748
- What did Collins say?
- They found a cave under the site.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.829
Did she give you any details?
What was the depth?

13:58.040 --> 14:02.238
She said it was big, Scarpelli,
I don't know.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.354
- Snyder said you found a cavern.
- Yes, under the excavation site.

14:24.560 --> 14:29.076
- I'd like to take a look.
- I ordered them to collapse it.

14:29.280 --> 14:35.276
- This is my only chance to study it.
- Seen one cavern, seen 'em all.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.918
In 1848, the English ship The Valiant
reported that these waters contain...

14:43.120 --> 14:47.636
...a mysterious creature
almost ten metres in length.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.195
That report is pure speculation.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.871
In 1983, a sonarman
aboard a US warship -

14:55.080 --> 14:59.995
- reported sonar contacts
moving with incredible speed.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.751
Operation Deepwell tried to penetrate
the Earth's crust right here in 1963.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.272
They lost drill bits in the cavern,
sent in four divers, no one returned.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.234
We have no idea what type
of marine life we're dealing with!

15:13.440 --> 15:16.512
- I'm too far behind schedule.
- My work is important, too.

15:16.720 --> 15:21.669
Miss Scarpelli, you're young, you've
worked very hard to come here.

15:21.880 --> 15:26.192
Sometimes, in order to get what we
want, we have to make sacrifices.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.915
Once we can prove that a permanent
colony can exist at this depth, -

15:30.120 --> 15:34.238
- we will conduct research
into all areas of marine biology.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.955
Please, you'll have to excuse me.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.509
- You'll have to keep it dry.
- Are you kidding?

15:46.720 --> 15:50.998
I'm in a leaky can
at the bottom of the ocean.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.352
I wouldn't have this shit if we went
topside when we were supposed to.

15:55.560 --> 15:59.633
I know it's a stretch. We'll go up as
soon as the missile site's in place.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.991
When is that?
He's had six months.

16:03.200 --> 16:09.036
Why do the Navy trust this guy to
put up a base? He's not in the Navy.

16:09.240 --> 16:14.951
- He's under a lot of pressure.
- So am I. "Snyder fix this..."

16:15.160 --> 16:20.678
- What would you do without me?
- Probably drown. Get dressed.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.317
I could stay for six months more,
but when you sign on for four, -

16:25.520 --> 16:28.114
- it ought to be four.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.677
- Give it a rest.
- You could do something.

16:35.640 --> 16:40.794
Norris, get me topside. Please.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.468
I'll try.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.274
It's open.

16:56.280 --> 17:00.990
- Captain?
- I'll be right with you. Have a seat.

17:10.839 --> 17:15.196
- Your son?
- Yeah, that's my little Mikey.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.997
The artist. I told him it was
beautiful here. Flowers, trees...

17:21.200 --> 17:26.479
- Must be nice having a family.
- It's what keeps me going.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.673
- You anxious to get home?
- Yes, I am.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.316
Now tell me why you came in here.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.875
Could you talk to Van Gelder about
letting me travel to the missile site?

17:41.080 --> 17:44.516
Collins has discovered
these unusual caverns.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.110
But Van Gelder is blowing them up
in order to place the missiles.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.835
If Van Gelder doesn't get
the platform in place this week, -

17:52.040 --> 17:54.998
- the Navy's gonna close the book
on Deepstar.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.192
I've studied these waters
for six months.

17:58.400 --> 18:02.279
We must proceed with caution.
Those caverns need to be checked.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.837
Otherwise, we don't know
what we're getting into.

18:07.040 --> 18:11.989
To be honest with you, I don't care
if they took a shovel to this place.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.557
I have to make sure Van Gelder gets
the site operational before we return.

18:16.760 --> 18:21.197
- I'm sorry.
- I still think it's a big mistake.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.079
Come on!

19:04.240 --> 19:08.279
- Water rationing can be a bitch.
- Very funny.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.517
You'll have to wait 24 hours
to finish showering, -

19:11.720 --> 19:17.829
- unless you persuade someone
to let you use their card.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.478
It's getting cold.

19:49.120 --> 19:53.477
- Let her down. Easy.
- I got it.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.032
Easy. Easy...

19:59.640 --> 20:02.632
You asshole.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.438
Seacat to Seatrak.
Last package in place.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.315
Okay, give me some distance.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.394
That's far enough.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.751
- Let her rip.
- Ready? Fire in the hole.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.910
- The sea floor is giving way.
- Back it up!

21:23.000 --> 21:26.072
You guys all right?

21:26.280 --> 21:30.432
- Yeah, we're okay.
- When I scrape out my drawers.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.475
Prep a remote. I want to see
what you're sitting on.

21:36.680 --> 21:41.993
- Are they serious?
- You heard her. Prep a remote.

21:42.200 --> 21:48.150
Remote batteries up to full.
Motors up, guidance system engaged.

21:48.360 --> 21:52.512
- Camera's on.
- Launch remote.

22:15.800 --> 22:22.194
Signal coming through. Seatrak?
Stand by to receive remote signal.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.556
It's like another world.

22:39.880 --> 22:44.670
Under every deep,
a lower deep opens.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.919
- What's that?
- Emerson.

22:49.120 --> 22:54.990
Shit, we should be recording this!
Seacat, I want to run a tape.

22:56.800 --> 23:02.636
<i>- She'll want some stills next.
- Hodges, some stills too.</i>

23:05.040 --> 23:11.354
Start the VCR. Set the stills
for five second intervals.

23:11.560 --> 23:17.271
VCR rolling and recording.
Port and starboard still cameras on.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.156
That wasn't so hard, was it?

23:39.360 --> 23:43.956
We lost the signal.
See if you can fix it.

23:45.600 --> 23:50.116
<i>- We're not getting any signal.
- We're working on it.</i>

23:50.320 --> 23:54.233
Goddamn piece ofjunk!
Better bring it up.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.873
- We lost the remote.
- Not again.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.470
Van Gelder's gonna shit kittens
when he finds out.

24:12.680 --> 24:17.037
"You know how expensive
remotes are?"

24:18.680 --> 24:25.279
- You wanna go after it?
- You mean, just go?

24:27.360 --> 24:31.399
- Standing by.
- Prepare to detach.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.037
- Detach.
- We're away.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.677
Can't wait to show this to Scarpelli.
She's gonna wet her panties.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.474
Underwater volcanoes have been
active here for a long time.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.911
The cavern was probably formed
by a lava bubble.

25:46.120 --> 25:50.875
- Could sea creatures have survived?
- It's possible.

25:51.080 --> 25:56.074
So they could be
thousands of years old?

25:56.280 --> 26:00.637
Let's see what the guys
have picked up on the remote.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.355
- They've detached.
- What are you doing?

26:04.560 --> 26:09.190
<i>- We have trouble with the remote.
- Did you lose it again?</i>

26:09.400 --> 26:13.871
<i>- We're rectifying the situation.
- If you lost it you're in trouble.</i>

26:14.080 --> 26:19.552
What? We're having trouble
with the transmission...

26:21.840 --> 26:25.469
If we get away with this,
it'll be a miracle.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.789
There it is. The remote.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.912
Let's bring it aboard
and get out of here.

26:47.120 --> 26:51.636
- You scared of a few ugly fish?
- This place gives me the creeps.

26:51.840 --> 26:55.435
I just don't like caves.

26:59.320 --> 27:04.792
- Sonar contact, bearing 237.
- Sonar contact? Here?

27:05.040 --> 27:11.912
Contact closer. 300 metres.
250... 150.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.908
I don't see anything.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.590
- Holy shit, I don't believe it!
- Mayday!

27:19.800 --> 27:22.997
- Look at the size of that thing!
- Get us out of here!

27:25.440 --> 27:27.908
What's wrong, Seacat?

27:28.120 --> 27:33.194
Seacat, come in. Do you read?
They're in trouble.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.836
See if you can get a fix on them.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.350
- No contact.
- That's impossible.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.788
Are you telling me
they've disappeared?

28:01.920 --> 28:05.390
- No contact.
- You're sure?

28:05.600 --> 28:12.392
Okay, I'm calling Laidlaw.
Deepstar 6, this is Seatrak.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.513
<i>Deepstar 6, this is Seatrak,
come in.</i>

28:18.920 --> 28:21.070
Shit!

28:26.080 --> 28:29.197
I got contact.

28:29.400 --> 28:34.235
I don't think it's Seacat.
It's moving too fast.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.950
- What is it, Collins?
- We've lost contact with Seacat.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.879
<i>- Get me the Captain.
- He's busy.</i>

28:49.080 --> 28:53.358
<i>- Get Laidlaw now, Snyder!
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

28:54.840 --> 28:56.353
Bitch.

29:18.120 --> 29:23.797
- What the hell was that?
- Check the stabilizers. Mayday!

29:24.000 --> 29:28.949
<i>Deepstar, mayday! This is Seatrak!</i>

29:34.960 --> 29:37.997
Stabilizers are out!

29:40.160 --> 29:42.833
Something is pushing us over!

29:51.640 --> 29:54.552
Let me try the switch.

30:21.280 --> 30:26.229
- Here's the Captain, Collins.
- Put her over the speaker.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.075
Say again, Seatrak. This is Deepstar,
please acknowledge.

30:36.600 --> 30:41.276
- Shit! I lost her.
- Trouble?

30:41.480 --> 30:45.917
She called and said she'd lost contact
with Seacat, and now I've lost her.

30:46.120 --> 30:50.830
The transmitter screwed up again.
When is the shift change?

30:51.040 --> 30:55.113
- Fourteen hours.
- I'd better check it out.

31:03.880 --> 31:08.476
- All right, Sport, let's hit it.
- She's ready to roll, Dad.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.194
Close us up.

31:25.880 --> 31:31.557
- Deepstar 6, how do you read?
- Loud and clear.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.957
- Pressure?
- 3.6 and holding.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.754
<i>- Oxygen?
- Oxygen is 4.0.</i>

31:37.960 --> 31:40.554
- Fuel?
- 412 pounds. Pressure steady.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.718
Locking collar?
Umbilicals?

31:43.920 --> 31:47.356
- Check.
- Henway?

31:47.560 --> 31:50.632
- Henway ready.
- What's a henway?

31:50.840 --> 31:54.037
About three to four pounds.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.397
Very funny, assholes. DSRV-2,
you are clear for departure.

32:03.600 --> 32:08.355
- Have a nice day, Snyder.
- I got your nice day right here.

32:54.160 --> 32:59.439
My heart is still beating?
I thought it stopped.

33:00.560 --> 33:05.395
Let me get some of this off you.
What is it?

33:05.600 --> 33:09.957
My legs. I can't move them.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.112
- Bad, huh?
- I've seen worse.

33:26.320 --> 33:30.916
- I don't think so.
- Did you see what hit us?

33:31.120 --> 33:36.433
- No. I have no idea.
- I'll see if I can move this.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.795
God, it's too heavy.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.198
You've got to stay awake
until help comes.

33:47.400 --> 33:52.838
- Someone's gonna come for us soon.
- You think I'll make it?

33:53.040 --> 33:57.238
Yeah, hang on. Just keep talking.

33:57.440 --> 34:02.878
At least one good thing will come
out of it. We'll be going home soon.

34:03.080 --> 34:09.155
Seatrak, DSRV-2 here. Do you read?
DSRV-2 to Seatrak.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.918
- Come in, Seatrak.
- They've had hours to fix the radio.

34:16.120 --> 34:20.431
- They couldn't fix a toaster.
- Yeah. I think she's in trouble.

34:20.639 --> 34:25.760
Collins can take care of herself.
Are you ever going to marry her?

34:25.960 --> 34:30.317
- Me, marry Collins? Get outta town!
- She's a great lady.

34:30.520 --> 34:35.799
Tell me something I don't know.
First woman to graduate SEALS.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.356
She's one of the Navy's finest.
She don't need a submarine pilot -

34:39.560 --> 34:42.710
- who's never had more
than a week's pay in his pocket.

34:42.920 --> 34:47.038
Apply to OCS. I've got some pull.
You can make it.

34:47.239 --> 34:52.871
Come on! Can you see me
in an officer's uniform?

34:53.080 --> 34:56.914
No way. I'll just moonlight
till the oil business picks up.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.999
- This is for the birds.
- Fish.

35:04.040 --> 35:08.750
Sonar contact. Bearing, 175.
600 metres, steady.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.714
- What kind of contact?
- I'm not sure.

35:12.920 --> 35:17.038
What the hell's that, a whale?
A sub?

35:17.240 --> 35:21.870
I don't think... Wait a second,
it's changing course.

35:22.080 --> 35:27.029
New bearing, 135.
500 metres, still closing.

35:27.240 --> 35:30.471
- It's heading straight for us.
- What's our speed?

35:30.680 --> 35:34.639
- 12 knots.
- Reduce speed to one-third.

35:34.840 --> 35:40.392
300 metres and still closing.
Christ, look at it move.

35:42.200 --> 35:46.079
All stop.
100 metres.

35:48.320 --> 35:53.314
What the hell is that?
I think we're in big trouble, boss.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.993
- Blow ballast. 100 metres.
- Forward tanks, blow.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.033
Kill the light.

36:15.680 --> 36:21.198
Positive 80. 90...
100 metres.

36:23.360 --> 36:28.036
- It's gone.
- Oh, man!

36:28.240 --> 36:32.791
- I wonder what it was.
- Who knows.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.191
We're on the turnpike.
Bullpen at 500 metres and closing.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.029
Seatrak, this is DSRV-2.
Do you read?

37:10.240 --> 37:15.872
- Jesus, what a mess.
- Seatrak, acknowledge.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.074
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.592
- Can we dock?
- The angle's wrong.

37:28.800 --> 37:33.316
- One bump and she's gone.
- Well, don't bump her, then.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.439
Come on, baby.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.868
Collar's in place. Umbilicals.

38:18.080 --> 38:24.872
CO2 is way up. Electrical fire.
She's leaking. Doesn't look good.

38:42.640 --> 38:48.272
- Have we still got a clean dock?
- Clean and tight. Pressure's holding.

38:49.800 --> 38:54.237
My father told me, "Stay at home,
help with the farm, son." Not me.

38:54.440 --> 38:59.116
I had to join the Navy
and see the fucking world. Ready?

39:03.360 --> 39:07.638
Did you hear that?
There it was again.

39:07.840 --> 39:12.391
They're coming.
I told you they'd rescue us.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.239
Oh, God, thank you.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.673
The hatch is jammed.
I'm not getting a green light.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.429
- Looks like the motor shorted out.
- Wanna crank it?

39:31.640 --> 39:37.715
I'll see if I can rewire it. We need
power for the lights and instruments.

39:37.920 --> 39:42.436
- Should you be doing that?
- Do I tell you how to drive subs?

39:42.640 --> 39:45.393
As a matter of fact, you do.

39:48.640 --> 39:52.758
Maybe we should use
the crank instead.

40:30.920 --> 40:35.198
Thank God.
Burciaga's legs are crushed.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.473
- He can't move.
- I'll get the rope.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.713
- Rope, rope, rope!
- Throw it down here.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.154
Come on...

41:17.440 --> 41:21.399
Ready, Mac? Easy now.

41:44.480 --> 41:48.917
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, buddy.

41:49.120 --> 41:52.590
He's gone.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.389
Move it! She won't hold forever!

41:59.960 --> 42:03.270
You gotta leave him.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.991
Come on! Give me your hand now.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.278
Come on, Mac.

42:34.600 --> 42:39.435
- I'm getting the box!
- Forget it. My back is broken.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.394
- It's stripped.
- Get out, save yourselves.

42:43.600 --> 42:48.196
- The circuit's fried.
- Get out of here! Save yourselves!

42:48.400 --> 42:52.393
That's an order!

42:56.560 --> 42:59.120
No way, man.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.628
PURGE - FLOOD

43:08.560 --> 43:10.551
No!

45:16.520 --> 45:19.990
You cold?

45:20.200 --> 45:23.476
Here, put this on.

45:27.080 --> 45:30.038
Put this on your legs.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.080
It's good to see you guys.

45:46.280 --> 45:51.070
- Let's get her warm.
- Put this around her. How are you?

45:51.280 --> 45:54.238
- A little damp.
- Get some dry clothes.

45:54.440 --> 45:59.514
- Let's get you checked out.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

46:19.040 --> 46:22.271
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

46:22.480 --> 46:28.715
- I guess it was a stupid question.
- No, thanks for asking.

46:28.920 --> 46:33.789
I know you and the Captain were
a lot closer than everybody else...

46:34.000 --> 46:40.030
I liked him a lot. I guess
I just came here to say that.

46:40.240 --> 46:44.631
- I'm going to miss him.
- I know.

46:44.880 --> 46:49.237
Hey,
I thought you may want to have this.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.476
I found that in some of his stuff.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.918
Thanks.

47:07.280 --> 47:09.236
I'll see you up top.

47:09.440 --> 47:14.070
Hodges and Osborne lost the remote
in the cave and went in to get it.

47:14.280 --> 47:19.513
That's when they saw something.
The remote, and something else.

47:19.720 --> 47:24.669
Something that scared them. Then
they screamed, then they were gone.

47:24.880 --> 47:29.112
- Did you see it?
- No, but the sonar picked it up.

47:29.320 --> 47:33.996
Something very big and very fast.

47:34.200 --> 47:39.194
Were there lights on the remote?
Were the Seatrak's work lights on?

47:39.400 --> 47:42.233
- Yeah, why?
- Stay put.

47:42.440 --> 47:45.830
Ever heard of photomigration?

47:46.040 --> 47:51.512
It's a theory of aggressive animal
behaviour associated with light.

47:51.720 --> 47:55.429
Topside approved your request
for extraction.

47:55.640 --> 47:59.872
Get Snyder to secure the station
and prep the DSRV for departure.

48:00.080 --> 48:03.550
- We're going home.
- Amen.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.954
What was that?

48:24.840 --> 48:28.116
That was our baby's heartbeat.

48:28.320 --> 48:33.394
Well... I'm gonna go check
on Snyder and Richardson.

48:44.000 --> 48:50.109
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought it was only my concern.

48:52.320 --> 48:57.394
- I didn't want it to be a problem.
- I can't believe you didn't tell me.

48:57.600 --> 49:03.516
You always say you're a drifter,
and you don't want to settle down.

49:24.760 --> 49:28.719
What do you say if it's a boy
we name it after the Captain?

49:30.720 --> 49:35.271
Philip Laidlaw McBride.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.875
I like that.

49:45.320 --> 49:51.111
Well... Sorry to piss on your picnic,
but Norris wants you on deck.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.958
Now.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.320
DSRV-2 is prepped and ready to go.

49:59.520 --> 50:04.275
Pack your gear and tell the others
to stand by for decompression.

50:07.520 --> 50:11.115
- What about the missile sled?
- I don't plan to do anything.

50:11.320 --> 50:15.871
I just got the retraction order,
the Navy can send a recovery team.

50:16.080 --> 50:19.277
All I'm asking you is to secure
the missile sled.

50:19.480 --> 50:24.634
- What's the procedure, Snyder?
- Only the Captain can order it.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.274
I thought we were beginning
decompression.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.392
That's postponed until we secure
the missiles.

50:30.600 --> 50:36.277
- It's not like people can steal them.
- Snyder, please. Just do it.

50:38.240 --> 50:42.313
- Fine.
- Do you want me to assist you?

50:42.520 --> 50:45.353
I think I can handle it.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.276
REQUEST PROCEDURE TO SECURE
ABANDONED MISSILE SLED

51:07.600 --> 51:13.835
DEFINE ABANDONED
A. FOR REPAIR OR REMOVAL

51:14.040 --> 51:19.319
B. TO NATURAL FORCES
C. TO AGGRESSION

51:23.480 --> 51:29.157
This thing that attacked you, was it
a natural force, or aggression?

51:29.360 --> 51:32.830
<i>- I don't know what you mean.
- The computer wants to know.</i>

51:33.040 --> 51:36.032
<i>It was aggressive action
by a force unknown.</i>

51:36.240 --> 51:41.189
<i>- Just get on with it.
- I'm just checking, okay?</i>

51:41.400 --> 51:45.359
Pardon my ass all the way to hell.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.790
Okay, aggression.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.359
EMERGENCY DETONATION

51:50.560 --> 51:53.757
- What will you do topside?
- I'm heading right for Big Lew's.

51:53.960 --> 51:58.397
Big Lew's Burger Barn. The greasiest
hamburgerjoint in the universe.

51:58.600 --> 52:02.752
I walk right in
and order a double fistful of meat.

52:02.960 --> 52:07.158
With cheese. Bucket of fries,
and a very large chocolate shake.

52:07.360 --> 52:11.399
I spent six months trying
to keep you on a healthy diet.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.990
You hear my arteries hardening?

52:16.320 --> 52:20.711
- Where's Van Gelder?
- Up gathering his homework.

52:39.040 --> 52:44.319
Search release.
Damn command directive...

52:44.520 --> 52:47.671
It's not gonna be my ass, I tell you.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.713
Seven, eight...

52:52.720 --> 52:57.032
Okay, boys and girls,
don't try this at home.

53:14.160 --> 53:17.630
- What the hell's that?
- What the fuck?

53:23.400 --> 53:27.598
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

53:29.160 --> 53:34.109
You idiot! What have you done?
You detonated the missile sled!

53:34.320 --> 53:38.518
- I secured the missile sled!
- You signed our death warrants.

53:38.720 --> 53:42.918
You know how much water detonating
a 20 megaton warhead displaces?

53:43.120 --> 53:47.432
- What are those?
- Concussion waves. Jesus.

53:47.640 --> 53:51.792
- They're registering force 20.
- Here it comes.

54:02.120 --> 54:06.875
Snyder, damage control!
Get me the diagnostic.

54:07.080 --> 54:11.392
Stand by!
Switch to VSL overlap.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.717
- Binary status.
- Overlap.

54:14.920 --> 54:17.195
FLP fraction.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.551
Revert to load unit.
System C!

54:20.760 --> 54:24.514
I'm on stand-by power,
good for two minutes only.

54:28.040 --> 54:31.635
- I'm losing the sensors.
- Try patching a bypass.

54:35.160 --> 54:39.676
- I got a fire over here.
- There's four warning lights.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.871
Structural deficiency.
Docking bay, aft.

54:53.080 --> 54:55.435
I'm on it.

55:07.240 --> 55:11.438
McBride, let's go! We got a leak.
The main strut may go.

55:21.880 --> 55:25.873
Bring it up! That's good.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.992
Get the extender real quick.

55:33.840 --> 55:38.391
Put it up there.
Crank it up.

55:42.440 --> 55:46.672
I'm switching on auxiliary.
I'm on count.

55:51.480 --> 55:54.392
Crank it up!

55:55.800 --> 55:59.076
Pull it!

55:59.280 --> 56:02.636
You've got to weld this
to the base plate!

56:02.840 --> 56:06.469
I got the flap!

56:13.400 --> 56:17.188
- Slow down.
- We're getting close.

56:17.400 --> 56:21.313
Norris! Shut down the water main!

56:26.320 --> 56:29.551
One more! About two inches.

56:31.480 --> 56:34.153
That's good.

56:35.920 --> 56:38.673
All right, it's done.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.989
Run a diagnostic.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.670
Crew's quarters are flooded,
power shortage in section...

56:50.880 --> 56:55.431
Hold it. The oxygen filtration
system's wrecked.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.790
So the air supply is gone?

56:58.000 --> 57:01.390
The main lines to
the decompression bay are ruptured.

57:01.600 --> 57:05.832
- So we're not going anywhere.
- How much air do we have?

57:06.040 --> 57:11.068
- Seven, eight hours maybe.
- Air is not the main problem.

57:11.280 --> 57:15.319
The cooling primary to the reactor
was destroyed.

57:15.520 --> 57:19.559
- It'll go supercritical soon.
- What happens when it does?

57:19.760 --> 57:24.436
- It'll explode.
- Welcome to ground zero.

57:24.640 --> 57:28.599
Snyder? Can you fix the radio?

57:28.800 --> 57:32.349
Sure, if I had the right parts,
and a week to do it.

57:32.560 --> 57:37.111
- Why don't we use the escape pod?
- Because we can't decompress.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.880
We can't leave the station.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.958
Snyder will get in the
Guinness Book of Records.

57:43.160 --> 57:47.153
Causing two nuclear explosions
in one afternoon has to be a record!

57:47.360 --> 57:51.512
- I followed procedure!
- You fucked up!

57:57.360 --> 58:02.992
Look at this. Can't we repair
the lines to the decompression bay?

58:03.200 --> 58:08.194
- They are too badly damaged.
- We might be able to run a bypass.

58:09.760 --> 58:14.470
You mean seal the rupture here?
Run a line from the medical lab, -

58:14.680 --> 58:20.073
- patch it into the airlock pressure
system... Bring up the blueprints.

58:22.640 --> 58:28.237
- BZN 17 through RTX 56.
- Yes. It might work.

58:31.880 --> 58:37.637
We've patched that in
from JVB-124, right?

58:37.840 --> 58:39.956
It connects the decompression
chamber to the lab.

58:40.160 --> 58:45.280
- Did you fit the converter coupler?
- No, I reversed the old coupler.

58:45.480 --> 58:49.758
Clever, Snyder. When you've got it
connected, give us a hand downstairs.

59:02.520 --> 59:04.750
That ought to do it.

59:04.960 --> 59:08.350
- Be careful.
- It's a walk in the park.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.996
McBride! Have you got the fitting in?

59:12.200 --> 59:15.158
Leave it off until Richardson
repairs the outside line.

59:15.360 --> 59:18.591
Ready for a video check.

59:29.240 --> 59:32.198
Video checks out.

59:39.320 --> 59:44.075
- I need a hard copy of LH 34.
- Coming up.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.669
<i>Right, kids, let's make it happen.</i>

59:53.000 --> 59:56.436
Clear. Let's try it.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.957
Richardson has to seal
the leak here.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.199
Then you patch in the bypass
to the decompression chamber.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.389
All set to get wet.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.119
<i>- I'm ready, let her rip.
- She's ripping.</i>

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.552
<i>I'm clear of the airlock.</i>

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.869
<i>I see the rupture.
Where do I patch in?</i>

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.030
- Find ENZ 6538.
- Hook up at ENZ 6538.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.394
<i>I got it.</i>

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.432
- Is he patched in yet?
- Richardson, are you patched in?

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.713
<i>Almost there.
I think that's got it.</i>

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.634
<i>Hold it.</i>

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.796
<i>- What's the problem, Richardson?
- I saw something.</i>

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.635
- Say again, please.
- What is this?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.673
His transmission's broke up.
Stand by.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.319
Tell him to get back
to the airlock right away.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.398
- Do you copy?
- Shut off the outside lights.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.479
- What about the lights on the suit?
- Not from up here.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.079
Okay, up!

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.194
Relax, pal,
we'll have you up in two seconds.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.551
He's down here, pull me out!

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.436
There's something in the airlock.
God damn it!

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.669
Jim!

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.594
Close the inside hatch!

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.390
- Snyder, the inside hatch!
- I got it.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.999
- It's blown!
- Scarpelli! Hit the override.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.231
I got the plug in.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.678
McBride, come on!

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.237
Jesus. Oh, God!

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.038
Stop, McBride!

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.078
Go! Come on, move!

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.116
<i>Let us in!</i>

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.834
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.629
- It got Scarpelli.
- Oh, my God.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.995
You son of a bitch!
We ought feed you to that thing!

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.793
It's coming up!

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.155
- You think the hatch will hold?
- Snyder, reactor status.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.634
In four hours, eleven minutes and
45 seconds the place will blow up.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.868
- The escape pod is our only chance.
- Don't be an idiot. We'll burst.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.278
Don't you call me an idiot! If not
for you, we'd be decompressing now!

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.631
Knock it off! Listen...

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.313
It stopped.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.195
We're gonna have to go
back down there.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.235
With that thing down there, we
won't get anywhere near the bypass.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.479
See what weapons you can find.
I'll see to Van Gelder.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.349
Let's go, Snyder.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.156
- There's a couple of M12's here.
- M12's ain't gonna kill it.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.229
- That thing was fucking big.
- We're just trying to hold it back.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.079
That thing killed half our crew,
I want it dead.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.795
Fucking A nothing! You ran like a
rabbit when it went for Richardson.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.470
You saw that thing!
What was I supposed to do?

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.433
We needed your help.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:55.239
Look, I was scared shitless, okay?
I wasn't thinking.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.273
We're all scared.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.594
Come on.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.430
Here, hold this.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:20.836
John, I've got to get those people
out of here. I can't do it alone.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.318
- What can I do?
- Can you tell me what that thing is?

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.675
Some form of arthropod. But very big.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.077
It might be one of Scarpelli's
cave dwellers.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.032
- Can we kill it?
- I don't know.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.272
- You know how to handle those?
- Of course I do.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.917
- How you feeling?
- Fine. Thanks for asking.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.875
- You got the guns. Good.
- And the shark darts.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.676
It's loaded with a CO2 cartridge.
You stick the point in, -

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.792
- the thing blows up like a balloon.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.073
Hold it. These cartridges
expired six months ago.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:25.158
- The fucking thing's out of date.
- Snyder, it works.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:28.955
I'm not going down
with that defective piece of shit!

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.599
Okay, it works.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.071
The whole place is filled.
That thing could be anywhere.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.756
The Navy. It's notjust ajob,
it's an adventure.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.118
- What are you doing, McBride?
- Strobes.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:28.393
Scarpelli said something about light.
Photo something...

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.879
Photomigration. Marine animals are
attracted to light as a food source.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.870
- It has a hard-on for light. So what?
- Don't you get it?

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:42.913
Light means lunch.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.355
- He's left.
- Are you sure?

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.872
Yeah. I'll go patch in the bypass.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.439
Almost got it.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.832
I got it patched in.
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.200
Close the door!

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.988
Did you see what happened
to Van Gelder?

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.993
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.710
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.833
What happened to Van Gelder
was not my fault.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.999
- You stay the fuck away from me!
- All right.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.228
- I did everything by the book!
- Get my kit.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.998
We don't have time for this.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.760
I didn't kill Van Gelder.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.476
- No one's blaming you.
- Yes, you are! For the missiles.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.516
You blame me for killing Richardson,
killing Scarpelli. Now Van Gelder...

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.720
What are you doing?

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.629
- It's just to calm you down.
- No shots! No fucking way!

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.400
We have to calm you down.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.793
- No!
- Take it easy, I'll let you go.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.151
- I didn't kill him.
- I know.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.314
- It's gonna be all right. Come on.
- He's really lost it.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.072
- I'm not surprised.
- Is he going to be all right?

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.229
I hope so. I really do.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:24.798
- We gotta get going.
- I know.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.958
We'll patch the escape pod
and the decompression chamber.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.278
- You got some supplies?
- Yeah. Go on.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.790
We'll meet you in the escape pod.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.953
I have to pack some food.
You sit right here.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.070
<i>Snyder. Snyder!</i>

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.389
<i>You bastard!
You wouldn't even die!</i>

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.397
Snyder, what are you doing?
Stop it!

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.794
You have to decompress first!

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.074
Don't be a fool!
You'll kill us all!

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.755
Look out!

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.109
Fuck it.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.756
Come on!

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.954
The other way.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.233
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
- He's already dead.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.316
The Command Center
is completely flooded.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.598
- Shit, the system's shorting out.
- Can you pull up the reactor status?

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.314
In a minute.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.913
Three hours and 43 minutes.
Barely enough to decompress.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.035
- I can't catch my breath.
- The air's almost gone.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.511
Will you marry me?

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.431
I'd marry anyone who'd get me
out of this mess.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.279
Done.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.358
The decompression chamber works.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.270
But without the mini-sub,
we're trapped.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:25.113
I'll swim across and bring the DSRV-1
to the decompression chamber.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:30.314
There must be another way.
That thing is still out there.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.956
I've always asked for the strength
to do your will, God.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.709
And I need your help now.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.515
I don't understand. I'm so scared.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.992
Please let McBride make it.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.998
Please let my baby live.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.833
Damn it, McBride, hurry up.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.751
He'll get the sub, I know he will.
And we're going to get topside.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.195
Right.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.072
Will you visit me on my farm in
New Hampshire? Sit on the porch, -

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.955
- listen to the trees.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.229
Smell the mountain air.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.917
- Oh God, it's McBride.
- Maybe he's stuck.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:19.111
Collins!
Get in the decompression chamber!

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.836
- It won't open.
- It takes 30 seconds to pressurize.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.870
Quiet.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.790
It's in here, I know it is.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:55.432
- We've got to help her!
- Take this, you sack of fish shit!

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.396
God!

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.351
There's nothing we could have done.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.349
REACTOR STATUS CRITICAL IN

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.637
McBride, wake up. It's time.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.748
Hatch secured.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.477
Ready to detach.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.149
We better hurry.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.913
Hold on. Shock waves.
Impact in three, two, one...

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.352
- Set stabilizers on full.
- Hard climb.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.110
We're losing starboard drive.
She's not holding.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.835
- We're taking on too much water.
- I'll see what I can do.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.589
The ballast control circuit's dead.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.394
All right,
I'm gonna drop both tanks.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.832
- We won't be able to stay afloat.
- It won't matter if we don't make it.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.675
- It's working. We're rising.
- It's okay.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.430
- I think we're going to make it.
- I know we will.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.832
We're here.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.030
- Abandon ship.
- My pleasure.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.836
No! Don't do it!

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.550
McBride!

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.957
McBride!

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.640
Thank you.
