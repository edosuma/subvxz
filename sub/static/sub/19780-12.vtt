WEBVTT

00:01.089 --> 00:03.290
Charlie: You sure you don't want me
to come to this ultrasound?

00:03.292 --> 00:04.391
I'm fine.

00:04.393 --> 00:05.759
Besides, I thought you had work to do.

00:05.761 --> 00:06.727
Eh.

00:07.362 --> 00:09.730
How you been feeling?

00:09.732 --> 00:10.631
I am not sure.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.399
I-I... things are changing,

00:12.401 --> 00:14.167
I'm expanding by the second,

00:14.169 --> 00:16.036
and Maggie's moving to London.

00:16.038 --> 00:17.904
Yeah, about that.

00:17.906 --> 00:19.006
What, uh...

00:19.008 --> 00:21.908
What if Maggie didn't
have to move to London?

00:21.910 --> 00:23.610
What do you mean?

00:23.612 --> 00:26.046
Well, I was kind of waiting
till this was official,

00:26.048 --> 00:27.414
but, um...

00:27.416 --> 00:29.383
a staff position just came up
at, uh, Hope Zion

00:29.385 --> 00:30.617
in Obstetrics,

00:30.619 --> 00:33.687
and Maggie's perfect for the position.

00:33.689 --> 00:35.289
- Oh, no.
- Really?

00:35.291 --> 00:37.257
- I thought you'd be happy about that.
- Of course, I am.

00:37.259 --> 00:38.625
It's just that
Maggie's been really happy

00:38.627 --> 00:39.726
with her decision to leave.

00:39.728 --> 00:40.927
So, you don't think
I should tell her?

00:40.929 --> 00:42.929
I don't know. They're leaving tonight.

00:42.931 --> 00:44.197
She and Syd are great together.

00:44.199 --> 00:46.333
- It's your call.
- Okay. No, I, uh...

00:48.336 --> 00:49.970
My lips are sealed.

00:49.972 --> 00:52.406
<i>Wait. You can see me.</i>

00:53.641 --> 00:55.208
Something wrong?

00:55.210 --> 00:56.877
Someone wants my attention.

00:56.879 --> 00:58.812
<i>Duder, I know you can see me,</i>

00:58.814 --> 01:00.247
<i>and I kind of need your help here.</i>

01:00.249 --> 01:01.748
Doctor will be with you in a minute.

01:03.052 --> 01:04.751
Oh, come on. Um...

01:05.987 --> 01:07.454
Okay, I got broken bones incoming.

01:07.456 --> 01:09.890
Um, you'll-you'll text me
a picture of the ultrasound?

01:09.892 --> 01:12.059
- Absolutely.
- I got to go.

01:12.061 --> 01:14.561
<i>Duder, wait up!</i>

01:16.364 --> 01:18.365
I'm just saying,
it's not that difficult.

01:18.367 --> 01:19.800
That's easy for you to say.

01:19.802 --> 01:21.702
You weren't up half the night with him.

01:21.704 --> 01:23.170
You just have to manage
your time better.

01:23.172 --> 01:24.371
I'm sure you can figure it out.

01:24.373 --> 01:26.173
You are a neurosurgeon.

01:26.175 --> 01:27.708
You're working all the time now,

01:27.710 --> 01:29.042
with this new job of yours.

01:29.044 --> 01:30.510
Yeah. Back to Bay Street.

01:30.512 --> 01:32.946
Turns out that finance
pays better than cookies.

01:32.948 --> 01:34.881
You're not nearly as accessible.

01:34.883 --> 01:35.982
You know, all this child rearing,

01:35.984 --> 01:37.217
it's falling on my shoulders, Jonathan.

01:37.219 --> 01:38.385
- Shahir?
- Hmm?

01:38.387 --> 01:39.619
You know the expression,

01:39.621 --> 01:41.388
"it's not exactly brain surgery"?

01:41.390 --> 01:42.756
Mm-hmm.

01:42.758 --> 01:45.158
That's about you, my beautiful man.

01:46.527 --> 01:49.429
Hey, this is our child.

01:49.431 --> 01:50.430
You can do this.

01:50.432 --> 01:52.199
Okay.

01:52.201 --> 01:54.101
Shanathan needs to burp.

01:55.103 --> 01:57.337
Don't call our pretend child that.

01:57.339 --> 01:58.438
Why?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.507
It's Shahir plus Jonathan. Shanathan.

02:00.509 --> 02:03.110
Yes, I understand, but explaining it...

02:03.112 --> 02:04.077
Shh. Oh, God.

02:04.079 --> 02:05.212
I got to go to work.

02:05.214 --> 02:06.680
Hey, you can do this.

02:06.682 --> 02:07.981
- Shh.
- I have faith.

02:08.515 --> 02:10.183
At least one of us does.

02:10.185 --> 02:11.318
Hmm?

02:11.320 --> 02:12.486
Shh.

02:14.323 --> 02:15.355
Oh.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.534
"An Evening with Steve Martin"?

02:27.536 --> 02:29.035
This is awesome.

02:29.037 --> 02:30.837
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

02:30.839 --> 02:33.006
- Gonna be a wild and crazy night.
- Wild and crazy...

02:33.008 --> 02:34.241
- Wait. Tomorrow night?
- What?

02:34.243 --> 02:36.476
I actually can't go tomorrow night.

02:36.478 --> 02:38.178
- Why not?
- It's Thursday night.

02:38.180 --> 02:40.147
That's bowling league.

02:40.149 --> 02:42.282
You can skip it for one week, can't you?

02:42.284 --> 02:44.551
I can't. The team depends on me.

02:44.553 --> 02:46.219
The team that I've never once
heard you mention.

02:46.221 --> 02:48.155
Rose: Ow!

02:49.057 --> 02:50.524
Ohh, Dr. Miller.

02:50.526 --> 02:52.159
Please, I need your help.

02:52.161 --> 02:53.226
Okay, Rose, what is it?

02:53.228 --> 02:54.694
Ohh, there's an elephant...

02:54.696 --> 02:55.762
Ohh!

02:55.764 --> 02:57.264
Parked in the middle
of my chest.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.899
Dr. Bell, this is... this is Rose,

02:58.901 --> 03:00.367
she's one of our more frequent flyers.

03:00.369 --> 03:02.169
Okay. All right. I'll take a look.

03:02.171 --> 03:03.203
- No!
- Right this way, Ma'am.

03:03.205 --> 03:04.304
Thank you,

03:04.306 --> 03:06.206
and thank you for
letting me off the hook.

03:06.208 --> 03:08.208
Oh, no, you're not off the hook.

03:08.210 --> 03:09.876
Heart looks perfect.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.478
Stomach, liver and kidneys,

03:11.480 --> 03:12.579
they're all where they should be.

03:12.581 --> 03:14.514
This is one healthy nipper.

03:14.516 --> 03:16.716
- She's brushing up on her British.
- Hmm.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.084
Look at those backflips.

03:18.086 --> 03:19.686
I know. Tell me about it.

03:19.688 --> 03:21.388
I feel like I've been
on the Zumba Flume 24/7.

03:22.791 --> 03:25.091
She's just showing off
for her adoring crowd.

03:26.528 --> 03:28.094
Um, did you say "her"?

03:28.096 --> 03:29.830
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:29.832 --> 03:31.097
You didn't want to know.

03:31.099 --> 03:32.365
No. No, I'm... I'm fine.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.433
It's just...

03:33.435 --> 03:35.202
Actually, I didn't expect it.

03:35.204 --> 03:37.404
You know, you did
this exact same thing to me

03:37.406 --> 03:38.305
with Luke, right?

03:38.307 --> 03:39.606
- Did I?
- Yes.

03:39.608 --> 03:42.042
Oh! I'm terrible at secrets.

03:42.044 --> 03:43.743
It's a good thing we're leaving tonight,

03:43.745 --> 03:45.378
or I would've told the whole hospital.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.280
That's great news.

03:47.282 --> 03:49.115
You gonna tell Charlie?
I thought he was coming.

03:49.117 --> 03:50.617
Well, he had work to do

03:50.619 --> 03:52.652
and I... I kind of wanted
to be alone for this.

03:52.654 --> 03:54.354
You okay?

03:54.356 --> 03:55.622
Yeah. I'm fine.

03:55.624 --> 03:58.859
Fine... but, uh, more importantly,

03:58.861 --> 03:59.993
what about you?

03:59.995 --> 04:01.094
You know, big move...

04:01.096 --> 04:02.963
Any job prospects for you over there?

04:02.965 --> 04:04.898
Well, I'm not sure it's gonna be as easy
as I thought, but...

04:04.900 --> 04:06.132
Sydney: I trained over there,

04:06.134 --> 04:07.734
but Maggie will have to re-certify.

04:07.736 --> 04:10.770
Might mean another fellowship year.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.772
You're gonna have to start over
from scratch?

04:12.774 --> 04:13.907
Yay!

04:13.909 --> 04:16.375
Ugh! Dr. Storms.

04:16.378 --> 04:18.478
Oh, everybody's least-favorite
plastic surgeon.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.247
His wife, Kimberly, went into labor.

04:20.249 --> 04:21.380
Care to join me for

04:21.382 --> 04:23.083
one last delivery at Hope Zion, Dr. Lin?

04:23.085 --> 04:24.551
I have some charting to finish,

04:24.553 --> 04:26.086
but I'll be up as soon as I can.

04:26.088 --> 04:27.354
Cheerio.

04:28.990 --> 04:31.124
I mean, it's fine.
I can start at the bottom.

04:31.126 --> 04:33.159
It's not like I was moving up here, right?

04:33.161 --> 04:35.095
Right.

04:41.536 --> 04:43.169
What?

04:43.171 --> 04:46.172
Charlie told me that
a staff position in Obstetrics

04:46.174 --> 04:47.474
just opened up.

04:47.476 --> 04:48.708
Staff position?

04:48.710 --> 04:50.343
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.417
Doesn't change a thing.

04:57.419 --> 04:58.785
I'm happy with my decision.

04:58.787 --> 04:59.786
Good.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.124
- What happened?
- Apparently, he fell 15 feet.

05:04.126 --> 05:06.293
Okay, let's check him for spinal damage.

05:06.295 --> 05:08.628
We're gonna roll him on three.

05:08.630 --> 05:11.031
One, two, and three.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.399
Aah!

05:14.036 --> 05:15.902
Sir, can you feel that?

05:15.904 --> 05:17.137
Okay. I'll take that as a yes.

05:17.139 --> 05:18.605
Looks like he landed on his legs.

05:18.607 --> 05:20.840
Or what's left of them anyway.
Let's, uh, have a look.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.709
Watch the pants, man!
They're my show pants.

05:22.711 --> 05:23.977
Okay, put your head down.
Head down.

05:26.514 --> 05:28.148
Okay. Whoa!
He must've nicked the femoral artery.

05:28.150 --> 05:29.182
Pressure here!

05:30.451 --> 05:32.352
Dare I ask why he's all wet?

05:32.354 --> 05:33.887
He was holding his breath
in a water tank

05:33.889 --> 05:35.055
suspended above Dundas Square

05:35.057 --> 05:36.356
until the wires snapped.

05:36.358 --> 05:38.592
Uh, quick follow-up question... why?

05:38.594 --> 05:40.560
His name is the Alluring Abbadon.

05:40.562 --> 05:41.928
The magic community's hailing him

05:41.930 --> 05:43.063
as the next David Blaine.

05:43.065 --> 05:44.564
Did you just say "magic community"?

05:44.566 --> 05:45.632
Yeah. I dabble in the dark arts.

05:45.634 --> 05:46.733
You got a problem with that, Dr. Miller?

05:46.735 --> 05:47.834
Yeah. I do.

05:47.836 --> 05:49.069
Okay. We need to stabilize
these fractures.

05:49.071 --> 05:50.370
Get him to imaging
and into an O.R. right away.

05:50.372 --> 05:52.872
Hey, he's dry drowning.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.874
Being submerged must have caused
pulmonary edema.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.309
Let's get a tube in him right now.

05:57.445 --> 05:58.912
<i>Hope you got some really good tricks</i>

05:58.914 --> 06:00.146
<i>up your sleeve, Doc.</i>

06:02.000 --> 06:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.945 --> 06:14.154
Zach: - Okay, he's tubed.
- Almost there.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.922
<i>Yeesh. Tough luck, bud.</i>

06:15.924 --> 06:17.691
<i>If only I could put this into my act.</i>

06:17.693 --> 06:19.659
<i>Yeah. They'd never believe it, right?</i>

06:19.661 --> 06:21.961
<i>- And what do we do now?
- I don't know.</i>

06:21.963 --> 06:23.863
<i>I mean, he's the only one
who can see us,</i>

06:23.865 --> 06:24.406
<i>but apparently,</i>

06:24.447 --> 06:26.666
<i>he's busy trying to save
your getaway sticks.</i>

06:26.668 --> 06:27.801
Okay. Good to go.

06:27.803 --> 06:30.003
- Breathing's normalized.
- All good down here.

06:30.005 --> 06:32.005
- <i>And what are we supposed to do?</i>
- Okay, Mr. Abbadon,

06:32.007 --> 06:33.306
we're gonna take good care of you.

06:33.308 --> 06:34.507
Just hang in there, all right?

06:34.509 --> 06:35.709
Gotta operate on these legs right away.

06:35.711 --> 06:36.743
<i>Uh...</i>

06:37.678 --> 06:39.913
Shortness of breath,
sharp pain in the right arm.

06:39.915 --> 06:40.947
What else could it be?

06:40.949 --> 06:42.349
It has to be a heart attack.

06:42.351 --> 06:45.719
Okay, Rose, I need you
to take a deep breath for me.

06:50.257 --> 06:51.524
Between you and me,

06:51.526 --> 06:53.226
bowling league is a euphemism.

06:53.228 --> 06:55.628
- I'm sorry?
- There's definitely something else

06:55.630 --> 06:56.996
going on with your boyfriend.

06:56.998 --> 07:00.900
I see.

07:00.902 --> 07:02.335
What makes you say that?

07:02.337 --> 07:04.337
The wisdom of five marriages.

07:04.339 --> 07:06.172
I don't even know what that means.

07:06.174 --> 07:07.540
Okay.

07:07.542 --> 07:08.641
Do you know what a turkey is?

07:08.643 --> 07:10.343
I'm sorry?

07:10.345 --> 07:12.345
Bowling-wise, what's a turkey?

07:12.347 --> 07:14.047
Again, no idea.

07:14.049 --> 07:15.482
It's three strikes in a row.

07:15.484 --> 07:17.417
If he's actually bowling every Thursday,

07:17.419 --> 07:18.485
he'll know that.

07:21.922 --> 07:23.223
Rose, what's that?

07:23.225 --> 07:24.724
It appears to be a thread.

07:27.995 --> 07:30.063
Attached to a sewing needle?

07:30.065 --> 07:31.809
That might explain
the pain in your right arm.

07:31.862 --> 07:34.768
I was sewing a button
back on a coat.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.699
You're not having a heart attack, Rose.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.124
But you may be having a panic attack.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.109
No. This isn't in my head.

07:40.192 --> 07:42.200
Okay. Well, you are welcome
to a second opinion,

07:42.201 --> 07:44.611
and I know just the guy
to give you one.

07:47.281 --> 07:49.382
Here you go, Kingpin. She's all yours.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.684
Patient is a 55-year-old woman

07:51.686 --> 07:53.286
presenting with nausea and headaches.

07:53.288 --> 07:54.921
Okay. I am the Chief of Neurosurgery.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.756
Do I need to be brought in
on every patient

07:56.758 --> 07:58.691
- that has flu-like symptoms?
- Oh, I just...

07:58.693 --> 08:00.660
That's a rhetorical question,
Dr. Williams.

08:00.662 --> 08:02.228
- Oh.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.496
My phone has colic.

08:03.498 --> 08:04.564
I have been up all night.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.599
- What?
- You wouldn't understand.

08:06.601 --> 08:07.867
You don't have children.

08:11.439 --> 08:14.240
Either the sleep deprivation
has completely taken over,

08:14.242 --> 08:16.556
or you are Antonella Markos.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.945
Please call me Nellie.

08:19.048 --> 08:20.580
This is my daughter, Poppy.

08:20.582 --> 08:22.115
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:22.117 --> 08:23.617
- You know her?
- Yes.

08:23.619 --> 08:25.385
Miss Markos is one of
the finest concert pianists

08:25.387 --> 08:26.353
on the planet.

08:26.355 --> 08:27.621
You know, I listen to your CD

08:27.623 --> 08:28.989
every other day on my way to work.

08:28.991 --> 08:30.624
Every other day.

08:30.626 --> 08:32.192
I told you we came
to the right hospital.

08:32.193 --> 08:33.427
Can we focus on her headaches?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.828
They've been getting worse and worse.

08:35.831 --> 08:38.499
- It's nothing.
- It's not "nothing," Mom.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.600
She's been so weak,
she's basically stopped eating.

08:41.269 --> 08:42.402
This is nothing that

08:42.404 --> 08:44.437
a bit of Tabacum
and lavender oil won't fix.

08:44.439 --> 08:46.606
Nellie, can you please follow my finger?

08:46.608 --> 08:47.373
Thank you.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.708
Some homeopathic remedies

08:48.710 --> 08:50.477
have been known to cause
adverse reactions.

08:50.479 --> 08:52.111
We should run some tests.
Dr. Williams?

08:52.113 --> 08:53.913
That's really not necessary.

08:53.915 --> 08:55.114
I'm feeling better already.

08:55.116 --> 08:56.216
I should get back to work.

08:56.218 --> 08:57.350
Ah, please stay.

08:58.652 --> 09:00.760
How about an autograph for your trouble?

09:01.091 --> 09:01.954
Yes.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.957
Yes, I would love that.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.992
Also, could you sign this consent form

09:05.994 --> 09:07.227
for a full blood panel?

09:07.229 --> 09:08.461
Right here.

09:10.364 --> 09:12.265
And I'll get my C.D. from the car.

09:13.635 --> 09:14.801
Thank you.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.274
Hey, I started to think
you found a better offer

09:21.276 --> 09:22.006
and bailed on me.

09:22.007 --> 09:23.118
No. Why would you think that?

09:23.152 --> 09:25.204
I'm just kidding. Relax.
Let me fill you in.

09:25.279 --> 09:27.685
Nurse Storms here had some
mild contractions overnight.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.688
- They were nothing, really.
- Easy for you to say.

09:29.746 --> 09:31.985
- She's 10 centimeters.
- Wait. She's fully dilated?

09:31.987 --> 09:33.004
You... You... You mean it's go-time?

09:33.005 --> 09:34.520
No, I can't be. I want an epidural.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.586
- Sorry. There isn't time.
- Yes, there is.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.858
- Oh!
- Oh, here comes another one.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.261
- Okay.
- Oh! Oh, damn you!

09:41.263 --> 09:42.328
- Ow!
- Gah!

09:42.330 --> 09:43.951
I can't believe how fast she progressed.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.298
Maggie:
It's a miracle she didn't give birth

09:45.300 --> 09:46.232
in your Range Rover.

09:46.234 --> 09:47.599
Oh, he never would've forgiven me.

09:47.636 --> 09:48.968
Oh! Arnie loves his car.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.503
No, I love our child more, Kim.

09:50.505 --> 09:52.372
Yeah, that remains to be seen, Arnie.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.573
Okay, can you two finish this later?

09:53.575 --> 09:54.808
'Cause right now, it's time to push.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.009
Okay.

09:57.912 --> 10:00.513
Damon:
<i>Hey, you can run but you can't hide.</i>

10:01.316 --> 10:03.450
<i>I just wanted to say it.</i>

10:03.452 --> 10:05.085
<i>My legs. You have to save them!</i>

10:05.087 --> 10:07.087
I'm gonna do my best.

10:07.089 --> 10:09.889
<i>Hey, yeah, I know the whole
squeaky wheel and all,</i>

10:09.891 --> 10:11.925
<i>- but, uh, what about me?
- No, no, no. You don't understand.</i>

10:11.927 --> 10:13.360
<i>No legs, no Leap of Faith.</i>

10:13.362 --> 10:14.627
<i>That's my signature trick.</i>

10:14.629 --> 10:16.429
<i>That's what everybody comes to see.</i>

10:16.431 --> 10:18.031
I'll tell you what.

10:18.033 --> 10:21.000
Why don't <i>you</i>
<i>keep him</i> entertained?

10:21.002 --> 10:22.836
Show him all your tricks.

10:22.838 --> 10:24.938
And when I'm done
operating on your legs,

10:24.940 --> 10:26.539
I'll take him off your hands.

10:26.541 --> 10:27.874
<i>I'm right here, you know.</i>

10:27.876 --> 10:29.275
Deal?

10:29.277 --> 10:31.778
<i>Well, I normally don't
perform for free, but...</i>

10:36.117 --> 10:37.851
I hate magicians.

10:37.853 --> 10:40.754
Oh, that might have been
<i>the</i> fastest delivery

10:40.756 --> 10:42.088
in the history of vaginas.

10:42.090 --> 10:43.923
We make a great team, you and me.

10:45.293 --> 10:47.560
That's when you say,
"Yeah, we do."

10:47.562 --> 10:50.196
"Can't wait to leave for London
tonight."

10:50.198 --> 10:51.564
Oh, maybe when we're there,

10:51.566 --> 10:53.767
we'll have to deliver babies
on the other side of the bed.

10:53.769 --> 10:56.035
You know, like the driving.

10:57.538 --> 10:58.772
Okay, that was funny.

10:58.774 --> 11:00.240
- What's up?
- Nothing.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.576
It's just Kimberly was on track
to becoming head nurse,

11:03.578 --> 11:05.178
and then she started dating Arnie,

11:05.180 --> 11:07.080
and disappeared.

11:07.082 --> 11:08.581
Mm. Different priorities now.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.683
But they don't even seem
to like each other.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.085
Do you think she resents the fact

11:12.087 --> 11:13.620
that she put his career
ahead of hers?

11:13.622 --> 11:15.288
Maggie, nobody likes Arnie Storms.

11:15.290 --> 11:16.756
You can't expect his wife to.

11:16.758 --> 11:19.959
Yeah, I think I just have
too much on my plate.

11:19.961 --> 11:21.261
I'm sorry.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.597
I'm gonna change my scrub top,
and I'll see you later.

11:28.636 --> 11:29.903
Alex: Oh.

11:31.906 --> 11:33.659
Maggs, you okay?

11:33.660 --> 11:34.959
No. I'm not okay.

11:35.031 --> 11:36.888
I'm definitely not okay.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.045
Why did you tell me
about the staff position?

11:39.814 --> 11:41.013
I don't know.

11:41.014 --> 11:42.092
I-I-I found out
that you had to re-certify,

11:42.125 --> 11:43.483
and I got protective.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.951
Oh, you thought telling me about

11:44.953 --> 11:46.719
the great opportunity
I'm leaving behind

11:46.721 --> 11:47.749
would make me feel better?

11:47.826 --> 11:50.490
No. I... I just wanted you to have
all of the information.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.624
Why now?

11:51.626 --> 11:52.992
Are you afraid for me?

11:52.994 --> 11:53.993
Is that it?

11:53.995 --> 11:55.462
Little Maggie going across the pond,

11:55.464 --> 11:57.130
trying to make it
without big sister Alex.

11:57.132 --> 11:58.131
Okay. Okay.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.333
Well, where is this coming from?

12:00.335 --> 12:02.268
I'm just...

12:02.270 --> 12:03.603
I'm scared.

12:03.605 --> 12:05.238
Right.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.306
Tell me about it.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.874
What are you scared about?

12:07.876 --> 12:09.175
Well, this isn't about me.

12:09.177 --> 12:10.310
This is about your stuff.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.212
Your stuff <i>is</i> my stuff.

12:12.214 --> 12:14.581
Okay, fine. The pregnancy?
Not connecting with it at all.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.815
I feel terrible about it.

12:15.817 --> 12:18.451
I keep having these
ridiculous dreams, and...

12:20.020 --> 12:21.354
I'm sorry.

12:21.356 --> 12:23.656
I... I am so sorry that
I told you about the job.

12:23.658 --> 12:26.025
I'm glad you did.

12:26.027 --> 12:28.528
I needed all the information, right?

12:28.530 --> 12:31.130
But, you're going anyway.

12:34.735 --> 12:36.135
It's Kimberly.

12:36.137 --> 12:37.637
Go. We'll... We'll talk later.

12:42.476 --> 12:44.077
It really hurts. Oh, wow.

12:44.079 --> 12:45.111
Where's the baby?

12:45.113 --> 12:47.080
We just moved her to the nursery.

12:47.082 --> 12:49.382
- Kim, where does it hurt?
- All over.

12:49.384 --> 12:50.779
And Dr. Storms?

12:50.853 --> 12:53.286
He's at Ikea getting a bassinet.

12:53.288 --> 12:55.021
He was too superstitious
to have any baby stuff

12:55.023 --> 12:56.489
- in the house before the birth.
- Mm.

12:56.491 --> 12:58.024
Yeah. That's a Jewish thing.

12:58.026 --> 13:00.059
Is having your cell turned off
at a crucial moment

13:00.061 --> 13:01.194
a Jewish thing, too?

13:01.196 --> 13:03.029
No, it's a guy thing,
but we're here for you.

13:03.031 --> 13:04.631
Chest pains?

13:04.633 --> 13:05.899
Oh, hell, yeah.

13:05.901 --> 13:07.400
Shortness of breath.

13:09.838 --> 13:10.737
Okay.

13:12.607 --> 13:14.240
She has an iliac vein clot.

13:14.242 --> 13:15.208
Mm-hmm.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.676
- I want my husband.
- It's okay.

13:16.678 --> 13:18.578
We're going to do everything
we can to find him.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.683
Chest pain means pieces of the clot

13:23.685 --> 13:25.718
must be breaking off
and moving towards her heart.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.154
So, if we don't break it up
before it gets to her lungs...

13:28.156 --> 13:30.056
She'll be dead within the hour.

13:35.376 --> 13:36.909
How's he lookin', Roxy?

13:36.911 --> 13:39.111
B.P. and heart rate are on the low side,

13:39.113 --> 13:40.780
but he's stable-ish.

13:40.782 --> 13:42.615
Okay, well, stable-ish
is gonna have to do.

13:42.617 --> 13:45.584
I'm gonna start with the intramedullary
rods.

13:45.586 --> 13:47.086
Dr. Harris, his pulse is spiking.

13:48.256 --> 13:50.156
What? I didn't put in the needle yet.

13:50.158 --> 13:51.791
More pulmonary edema?

13:57.364 --> 13:59.465
Okay. Petechial rash.

13:59.467 --> 14:01.600
Bone marrow from the breaks
must have gotten in his blood.

14:01.602 --> 14:03.269
Fat embolism.

14:03.271 --> 14:04.503
Yeah. Change of plans.

14:04.505 --> 14:06.372
Um, I'm gonna secure these fractures

14:06.374 --> 14:07.773
with a temporary ex-fix.

14:07.775 --> 14:10.543
And somebody get Dr. Bell
down here, please.

14:33.668 --> 14:36.101
- Dr. Hamza.
- Hmm?

14:36.103 --> 14:37.336
Hm.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.471
I've just been watching her
for the past few minutes.

14:41.341 --> 14:42.808
I don't want her to stop.

14:47.481 --> 14:49.281
Are you crying?

14:49.283 --> 14:51.350
Oh! I didn't...

14:51.352 --> 14:53.152
You don't really strike me
as the crying type.

14:53.154 --> 14:55.421
Right. I'm just incredibly tired.

14:57.624 --> 14:59.702
She has a toxic level of gelsemium

14:59.703 --> 15:00.515
- in her system.
- Oh.

15:00.531 --> 15:03.395
It's what's causing
the flu-like symptoms.

15:03.397 --> 15:05.664
She's been accidentally
poisoning herself.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.166
Okay, thank you, Dr. Williams.

15:10.705 --> 15:12.638
Hmm.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.206
I think I know what's wrong with her.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.779
Nellie...

15:20.781 --> 15:22.548
how long have you known
you've had Parkinson's?

15:24.584 --> 15:28.454
Homeopaths use gelsemium
to treat tremors.

15:28.456 --> 15:29.488
Nellie?

15:31.157 --> 15:32.558
Six months.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.093
Poppy: Six months?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.166
It's fine. It's fine.

15:41.168 --> 15:42.468
What am I looking at, Charlie?

15:42.470 --> 15:44.303
Charlie:
Fat embolism from femoral fractures...

15:44.305 --> 15:46.171
He's tachycardic
with ventilation issues.

15:46.173 --> 15:47.273
Thoughts?

15:47.275 --> 15:49.108
We need to attack the fat directly.

15:49.110 --> 15:50.576
It's in a thousand tiny pieces.

15:50.578 --> 15:51.777
Mm, flush it out.

15:51.779 --> 15:53.379
Bronchoalveolar lavage.

15:57.017 --> 15:58.751
What do you know about bowling?

15:58.753 --> 16:00.586
What?

16:00.588 --> 16:03.789
Gutter ball, shared shoes... turkeys.

16:03.791 --> 16:06.091
Everything okay, Dawn?

16:09.296 --> 16:11.697
I think Zach is lying to me.

16:11.699 --> 16:14.266
About bowling?

16:14.268 --> 16:16.735
Bowling is a euphemism. Never mind.

16:17.772 --> 16:20.539
Well, Zach doesn't strike me

16:20.541 --> 16:21.640
as a deceptive type.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.910
Oh, here we go...
Bro code, right?

16:24.912 --> 16:27.446
I'm the crazy girlfriend
making stuff up in my head.

16:27.448 --> 16:28.914
No, it's...

16:30.183 --> 16:31.884
<i>That's awesome.</i>

16:31.886 --> 16:33.085
No, it's just that...

16:33.087 --> 16:34.887
You know, sometimes
you have to give people

16:34.889 --> 16:36.388
the benefit of the doubt.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.856
If he's keeping something from you,

16:37.858 --> 16:39.792
- maybe he's got good reason for it.
- Oh, yeah?

16:39.794 --> 16:41.126
Is that what you tell yourself

16:41.128 --> 16:42.428
when you keep stuff from Alex?

16:42.430 --> 16:43.629
<i>Give it to me straight, Doc.</i>

16:43.631 --> 16:45.264
<i>Did you save my legs?</i>

16:47.400 --> 16:48.534
Yes.

16:51.304 --> 16:52.938
What's going on?

16:52.940 --> 16:54.940
I step out for two minutes,
everything goes to hell?

16:54.942 --> 16:56.141
Where's my baby?

16:56.143 --> 16:58.344
We tried to page you,
and your baby's fine.

16:58.346 --> 17:00.045
Kimberly has an iliac vein clot.

17:00.047 --> 17:01.914
Which we've countered with heparin.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.649
Dr. Lin, you have a history
with blood thinners.

17:03.651 --> 17:05.617
Are we taking bets as to when
my wife goes into a coma?

17:05.618 --> 17:07.752
Kimberly: - Arnie, please.
- Anything happens to her,

17:07.755 --> 17:08.988
I'll be sure to talk to Dr. Harris

17:08.990 --> 17:10.455
about your suitability
for the staff job.

17:10.458 --> 17:11.890
Staff job?

17:11.892 --> 17:13.192
Dr. Benton's leaving.

17:13.194 --> 17:14.425
That's why we're stuck with you.

17:14.428 --> 17:15.928
I want my wife monitored
every 15 minutes.

17:15.930 --> 17:17.061
Arnie, I know you're upset,

17:17.064 --> 17:18.530
but the best thing
that you can do right now

17:18.531 --> 17:21.000
is take off your lab coat
and be with your wife.

17:21.002 --> 17:23.167
We're gonna let the heparin
keep working its magic,

17:23.170 --> 17:24.472
and we'll be back
to check on you in a bit.

17:24.601 --> 17:26.171
- Thank you.
- Okay.

17:26.173 --> 17:28.574
Dr. Lin, a word.

17:34.447 --> 17:36.115
You knew about this staff position?

17:36.117 --> 17:38.684
I heard about it this morning,
but it's not for me.

17:38.686 --> 17:39.952
Nothing's changed.

17:39.954 --> 17:41.720
What are you talking about?

17:41.722 --> 17:43.956
Everything has changed.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.357
Maggie, I can't be the person

17:45.359 --> 17:47.159
who takes you away
from this opportunity

17:47.161 --> 17:48.660
so you can start all over again.

17:48.662 --> 17:50.262
Don't do this for me.

17:50.264 --> 17:52.364
It isn't for you. It's for me.

17:52.366 --> 17:54.299
I want to go to England.

17:54.301 --> 17:57.036
It's my choice, and I chose you.

17:58.605 --> 18:00.239
If you had known about
this staff job

18:00.241 --> 18:01.807
before I asked you
to come with me,

18:01.809 --> 18:03.442
would you have
made the same choice?

18:05.011 --> 18:06.345
Yes.

18:09.216 --> 18:12.017
Don't put me in this position.

18:12.019 --> 18:13.052
What are you saying?

18:13.054 --> 18:14.787
I'm saying I love you,

18:14.789 --> 18:16.688
but I don't want you
spending your whole life

18:16.690 --> 18:18.323
regretting this decision.

18:20.827 --> 18:22.928
Don't come with me.

18:31.358 --> 18:32.258
- Hi.
- Oh.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.626
I heard you were on the ward.

18:33.628 --> 18:35.661
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

18:35.663 --> 18:38.231
Much better. Thanks.

18:38.233 --> 18:39.432
You have a patient up here?

18:39.434 --> 18:40.700
No, actually.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.968
Um...

18:41.970 --> 18:43.469
Oh, my!

18:43.471 --> 18:45.505
Congratulations.

18:45.507 --> 18:47.173
Thank you.

18:47.175 --> 18:51.043
Yeah, whenever I have some time,
I wander the ward, and...

18:51.045 --> 18:53.045
That's not as weird as it sounds.

18:53.047 --> 18:54.313
No, I used to do it all the time...

18:54.315 --> 18:55.481
just trying to get in the mood.

18:58.185 --> 18:59.185
What did you name her?

18:59.187 --> 19:01.220
Alice.

19:01.222 --> 19:03.623
Alice Suzanne Storms.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.158
Arnie wanted to call her Gertie.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.192
Oh, well...

19:07.662 --> 19:08.961
Alice is perfect.

19:08.963 --> 19:11.898
She really is, even in my belly.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.666
I don't know if I've ever loved
anyone like that before.

19:13.668 --> 19:14.867
But you must know what I mean.

19:14.869 --> 19:15.795
Sure.

19:15.842 --> 19:17.703
Yeah, of course I do.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.106
Oh, my...

19:20.108 --> 19:20.643
Ohh!

19:20.643 --> 19:21.391
Is everything all right?

19:22.276 --> 19:23.902
Yeah, I just have a pain
right up my back.

19:23.932 --> 19:25.615
- Oh, my...
- Let me take Alice for you.

19:25.761 --> 19:27.083
- All right.
- Ohh.

19:27.196 --> 19:28.457
There we go.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.553
All right, let's have a feel.

19:35.989 --> 19:38.871
Your uterus seems deviated
to the side.

19:38.989 --> 19:42.088
There may be internal bleeding.
Page Dr. Katz now.

19:43.097 --> 19:44.730
Am I gonna see my baby again?

19:44.732 --> 19:48.000
Hold tight, Kim. Hold tight.

19:55.342 --> 19:57.410
You sure about this, Maggie?

19:57.412 --> 19:58.227
Yeah.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.954
The timing couldn't be better, actually.

20:00.012 --> 20:00.633
Okay.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.148
Well, you won't
be seeing patients

20:02.150 --> 20:02.984
for the first few weeks,

20:03.028 --> 20:05.318
but if you're sure...

20:06.339 --> 20:07.037
You can move in

20:07.038 --> 20:09.587
to your brand-spanking new office.

20:13.961 --> 20:16.062
<i>Come here, come here, come here!</i>

20:16.064 --> 20:17.202
Everything okay?

20:17.255 --> 20:17.804
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:17.805 --> 20:19.711
I'm just dealing
with a really difficult case.

20:19.722 --> 20:21.827
Yeah, I heard... Kimberly Storms.

20:21.913 --> 20:23.483
You know what they say about, uh,

20:23.552 --> 20:25.334
treating other doctor's wives...

20:25.513 --> 20:27.180
Hang an IV, call for help.

20:27.943 --> 20:29.495
Well, you're not wrong.

20:29.577 --> 20:31.777
It's Kimberly. I got to take this.

20:31.832 --> 20:32.878
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

20:32.939 --> 20:34.009
Keys.

20:34.318 --> 20:35.488
Yeah.

20:43.056 --> 20:44.957
<i>Hey, you said you saved my legs.</i>

20:44.959 --> 20:46.259
I did.

20:46.261 --> 20:47.074
<i>Well, why am I still
in the operating room?</i>

20:47.116 --> 20:48.592
Because you developed
another complication.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.196
Don't worry.

20:50.198 --> 20:51.430
Dr. Bell's an excellent surgeon.

20:51.432 --> 20:52.732
You're in very good hands.

20:52.734 --> 20:53.793
<i>Oh, better than a guy
who can talk to ghosts?</i>

20:53.835 --> 20:54.737
<i>I find that hard to believe.</i>

20:54.781 --> 20:56.836
If I learn more,
I'll come find you, okay?

20:56.838 --> 20:59.435
<i>Hey, hey. This, uh...
This thing of yours.</i>

20:59.486 --> 21:01.855
<i>Can you talk to spirits, the dead,</i>

21:01.978 --> 21:04.170
<i>or just the ones in this hospital?</i>

21:04.230 --> 21:06.279
Magicians never reveal their secrets.

21:06.281 --> 21:08.781
<i>I mean, what? Look, just...</i>

21:08.783 --> 21:10.816
<i>It's... It's real magic, man.</i>

21:10.818 --> 21:11.699
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

21:11.722 --> 21:13.290
- Not so sure about that.
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

21:13.347 --> 21:14.784
<i>It's the best monkey of all time.</i>

21:14.861 --> 21:18.090
<i>Monkey. Why'd you say the...</i>

21:18.092 --> 21:19.072
<i>It's a truck.</i>

21:19.109 --> 21:22.971
<i>It's a... It's a</i>

21:23.269 --> 21:24.591
<i>What's going on?</i>

21:24.654 --> 21:27.466
Okay. BAL may be interfering
with your ventilation.

21:27.468 --> 21:29.335
You're about to have a stroke.

21:31.939 --> 21:35.783
Dawn: Clearing out the last
of the debris, and...

21:36.063 --> 21:37.671
Presto.

21:38.286 --> 21:39.894
Sorry. He's a magician.

21:41.942 --> 21:43.189
Hey. We need to raise

21:43.190 --> 21:44.689
his positive-end
expiratory pressure.

21:44.772 --> 21:46.703
Welcome back, Dr. Harris.
I'm just finishing up.

21:46.731 --> 21:48.227
No, you're not.

21:48.228 --> 21:49.412
He's stroking out.

21:49.524 --> 21:50.639
What are you talking about?

21:50.719 --> 21:52.705
The BAL is interfering
with his ventilation.

21:52.859 --> 21:53.989
His stats are bottoming out.

21:54.041 --> 21:55.677
He is bucking the vent a bit.

21:55.995 --> 21:58.472
Listen, Dawn, I will explain later.

21:58.578 --> 21:59.989
Just trust me on this, okay?

22:00.821 --> 22:01.906
All right, you heard the man.

22:01.971 --> 22:03.419
Get me the JET ventilator.

22:03.538 --> 22:04.704
I hope you're right.

22:04.706 --> 22:06.205
Yep. Me, too.

22:06.207 --> 22:07.306
<i>Me three.</i>

22:07.308 --> 22:08.841
Me four.

22:08.843 --> 22:11.177
Sorry. 40 megs of Propofol.

22:11.179 --> 22:13.980
Everything okay, Dr. Harris?

22:15.950 --> 22:18.117
Yeah.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.052
Yeah.

22:22.556 --> 22:24.123
<i>I...</i>

22:24.125 --> 22:26.325
Levodopa and dopamine
have also been known to help.

22:26.327 --> 22:27.393
We could try that.

22:27.395 --> 22:29.495
I tried them both. They didn't help.

22:29.497 --> 22:31.597
We could get you
on some anticholinergics

22:31.599 --> 22:32.832
like trihexyphenidyl.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.133
I've tried everything.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.902
Gelsemium is the only thing
that's working.

22:35.904 --> 22:37.303
It's not, though.

22:37.305 --> 22:40.673
The plant is highly toxic,
and you're poisoning yourself.

22:40.675 --> 22:44.677
As long as I can complete
my opus, I'll die happy.

22:44.679 --> 22:47.914
Mom, you would rather play
the piano than live?

22:47.916 --> 22:49.949
Playing <i>is</i> living for me.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.652
You know I love you, but this...
this is who I am.

22:52.654 --> 22:54.487
And I wouldn't understand, right?

22:54.489 --> 22:56.355
You are supposed to be my mother,

22:56.357 --> 22:59.458
but you were never really there for me,

22:59.460 --> 23:01.794
so why would dead be any different?

23:09.002 --> 23:10.169
You have kids?

23:10.171 --> 23:12.071
Um...

23:12.073 --> 23:14.307
Not ones that aren't digital.

23:16.610 --> 23:18.578
My partner and I
are trying to adopt.

23:18.580 --> 23:22.215
That's brave in your line of work.

23:22.217 --> 23:23.916
You can't have it all, doctor.

23:23.918 --> 23:25.885
Don't let anyone tell you different.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.988
You're only meant
to be truly great at one thing.

23:31.992 --> 23:33.993
Have you considered
surgical options, Nellie?

23:33.995 --> 23:36.062
I'm not aware of any.

23:36.064 --> 23:38.798
Okay, there's a procedure
called Deep Brain Stimulation...

23:38.800 --> 23:40.066
DBS.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.567
We install electrodes.

23:41.569 --> 23:43.469
It's like having a pacemaker
in your brain.

23:43.471 --> 23:44.871
That seems risky.

23:44.873 --> 23:46.572
Well, there are risks,
some cognitive ones,

23:46.574 --> 23:48.207
but we've had success with DBS

23:48.209 --> 23:50.376
on selected Parkinson's patients.

23:50.378 --> 23:52.278
There are no guarantees,

23:52.280 --> 23:55.081
but it could buy you some time,
tremor free.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.415
How much time?

23:56.417 --> 23:59.218
A few years, maybe more.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.853
Long enough to finish my opus.

24:02.055 --> 24:04.924
Or spend time with your daughter.

24:04.926 --> 24:06.492
Hmm.

24:07.896 --> 24:09.942
CT results.

24:10.531 --> 24:11.238
Oof.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.386
The birth was so fast,
the baby's head must have caused

24:13.387 --> 24:15.270
a rupture into the
retroperitoneal space.

24:15.427 --> 24:16.608
And the heparin
that you have her...

24:16.654 --> 24:18.362
Made things 10 times worse.

24:18.439 --> 24:20.156
I can't believe this is happening again.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.208
We have to get her off the blood
thinner or she'll bleed out.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.776
But if we do take her
off the heparin,

24:23.778 --> 24:25.645
she'll die from the massive
clots to the lungs.

24:25.647 --> 24:27.647
We've got to get in there,
do something now.

24:27.649 --> 24:28.781
A cava umbrella.

24:28.783 --> 24:30.049
Brilliant.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.217
Insert through her leg,

24:31.219 --> 24:32.685
weave it up into her abdomen,

24:32.687 --> 24:33.853
just below the renal veins?

24:34.191 --> 24:35.821
Stop the larger clots
from reaching the lungs,

24:35.823 --> 24:37.123
and when that's in place,

24:37.125 --> 24:38.658
- we'll take her off the blood thinner.
- Great.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.592
I have to be at the airport
in three hours,

24:39.594 --> 24:40.793
but I can do this.

24:40.795 --> 24:42.593
All due respect, Syd,
I'm already at the dance.

24:42.594 --> 24:43.963
Let me show you my moves.

24:43.965 --> 24:45.631
Okay, Dr. Reid.
Let's boogie.

24:45.633 --> 24:47.466
Okay.

24:50.579 --> 24:52.146
Okay, pump going on.

25:00.689 --> 25:03.290
Ventilation is normalizing.

25:03.292 --> 25:04.591
Looks like we're out of the woods.

25:11.299 --> 25:13.901
<i>A truly magical save.</i>

25:16.671 --> 25:18.872
I never got into magic as a kid.

25:18.874 --> 25:20.707
<i>And now you're talking to a ghost.</i>

25:20.709 --> 25:22.176
Yeah.

25:22.178 --> 25:27.381
<i>Look, this trick of yours,
Doc... I need to learn it.</i>

25:27.383 --> 25:30.417
Why?

25:35.191 --> 25:36.957
<i>I was married once, you know?</i>

25:36.959 --> 25:39.226
<i>It was the best three years of my life.</i>

25:40.695 --> 25:43.197
<i>I didn't deserve him.</i>

25:43.199 --> 25:46.300
<i>And I kept waiting
for the other shoe to drop,</i>

25:46.302 --> 25:48.468
<i>and then it did.</i>

25:48.470 --> 25:50.671
What happened?

25:50.673 --> 25:55.242
<i>Uh, brain aneurysm...
in the dining room.</i>

25:55.244 --> 25:56.977
<i>Now you see him,</i>

25:56.979 --> 26:00.347
<i>now you don't.</i>

26:00.349 --> 26:01.982
I'm sorry.

26:01.984 --> 26:03.717
<i>I threw myself into my work.</i>

26:03.719 --> 26:06.653
<i>I thought maybe if I work hard
enough on the magic act,</i>

26:06.655 --> 26:09.122
<i>maybe...</i>

26:09.124 --> 26:10.524
You could see him again?

26:10.526 --> 26:11.825
<i>And then I meet you,</i>

26:11.827 --> 26:13.727
<i>and you got the magic, man!</i>

26:13.729 --> 26:15.862
<i>You got to teach me.</i>

26:15.864 --> 26:17.364
I can't.

26:20.134 --> 26:22.336
I'm sorry. I don't even
know how I got this.

26:28.143 --> 26:32.646
<i>I'd do anything just to...
just to see him once more.</i>

26:35.884 --> 26:38.585
Yeah. I get that.

26:42.825 --> 26:45.559
Now, be careful.

26:45.561 --> 26:48.095
She's a high-bleed risk,
so if you nick anything...

26:49.264 --> 26:52.366
If you're gonna let me lead,
Dr. Katz, let me lead.

26:52.368 --> 26:55.335
Almost there.

26:55.337 --> 26:57.938
Okay.

26:57.940 --> 27:00.140
Expanding.

27:00.142 --> 27:01.608
All right.

27:01.610 --> 27:03.076
Looks like we're over the hump.

27:03.078 --> 27:04.845
Okay, there's no need

27:04.847 --> 27:06.346
for two obstetrical
staff members in here,

27:06.348 --> 27:09.616
and I have a plane
to catch, so...

27:09.618 --> 27:12.953
Your idea saved this patient's life.

27:12.955 --> 27:16.423
Hope Zion's lucky to have you.

27:16.425 --> 27:18.725
W-Wait.

27:21.763 --> 27:22.996
Is this goodbye?

27:22.998 --> 27:25.732
I guess so.

27:25.734 --> 27:29.303
Well, like, call me
when you get there, okay?

27:30.105 --> 27:33.040
Sure.

27:44.953 --> 27:46.350
Do you want to talk about it?

27:46.407 --> 27:48.522
What is there to talk about?

27:48.524 --> 27:49.923
I finally got the job I always wanted,

27:49.925 --> 27:53.393
and... couldn't be happier.

28:03.137 --> 28:04.438
What's a turkey?

28:05.674 --> 28:09.876
Um, from the poultry family,

28:09.878 --> 28:12.612
popular on Thanksgiving?

28:12.614 --> 28:14.348
Bowling-wise.

28:14.350 --> 28:16.516
Don't know.

28:16.518 --> 28:18.352
So you don't bowl on Thursdays.

28:18.354 --> 28:19.286
What do you do?

28:19.288 --> 28:20.721
Okay, wait a minute.

28:20.723 --> 28:22.356
I do bowl on Thursdays,

28:22.358 --> 28:26.793
but sometimes it's mini golf,
the arcade.

28:26.795 --> 28:28.495
Jesus. How old is she, Zach?

28:28.497 --> 28:29.796
No. What? No!

28:29.798 --> 28:31.298
You need to level with me.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.266
Okay, Dawn, listen.

28:35.070 --> 28:37.971
It's the boys... Jacob and Oliver.

28:37.973 --> 28:41.141
We're just trying to figure out
a proper visitation schedule

28:41.143 --> 28:42.442
until they get settled.

28:48.316 --> 28:49.883
I'm sorry.

28:49.885 --> 28:51.952
Why didn't you just tell me that?

28:51.954 --> 28:55.655
I-I-I like mini golf. I could join you.

28:55.657 --> 28:57.357
I love your boys.

28:57.359 --> 28:58.592
I know. I know you do.

28:58.594 --> 29:00.794
I know, and I...

29:00.796 --> 29:02.996
They... They just... They're...

29:02.998 --> 29:04.464
They don't like me.

29:04.466 --> 29:05.665
No, it's not that.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.200
It's just that they...
they just... they just wanted

29:07.202 --> 29:09.903
a little bit of alone time
with their dad.

29:09.905 --> 29:11.338
Why didn't you just tell me that?

29:11.340 --> 29:13.306
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

29:13.308 --> 29:14.674
So you lied to me?

29:14.676 --> 29:16.076
No, I...

29:16.078 --> 29:17.978
Look, Dawn.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.680
You are so amazing with them.

29:20.682 --> 29:23.116
It's... But you're not their mother.

29:27.054 --> 29:29.589
Look.

29:29.591 --> 29:32.459
They just don't know you
like I know you,

29:32.461 --> 29:34.361
and they just need a little bit of time.

29:34.363 --> 29:36.630
That's all.

29:36.632 --> 29:38.665
Me, too.

29:48.376 --> 29:49.776
Nellie, you wanted to see me?

29:49.778 --> 29:50.710
Yes.

29:50.712 --> 29:52.379
I think I have decided
to go forward

29:52.381 --> 29:54.214
with the Deep Brain Stimulation.

29:54.216 --> 29:56.516
I think that's the right decision.

29:56.998 --> 29:58.585
It'll take a while to set everything up

29:58.586 --> 29:59.701
and to book a surgery,

30:00.140 --> 30:03.888
but if the DBS is successful,
it could quiet the tremors.

30:03.988 --> 30:06.050
The cognitive risks... tell me more.

30:06.411 --> 30:08.516
Well, even if we are successful,

30:09.120 --> 30:11.879
a bilateral GPI surgery
coupled with a hemorrhage

30:11.881 --> 30:14.047
could create some cognitive deficits.

30:14.049 --> 30:15.515
Is it going to affect her playing?

30:15.517 --> 30:17.350
Well, after the surgery,
there's a chance

30:17.352 --> 30:19.219
your mother might not remember
how to play the piano.

30:19.221 --> 30:20.821
Then that's a deal-breaker.

30:20.823 --> 30:22.189
No, it isn't.

30:22.191 --> 30:24.190
Let's hear him out.

30:24.192 --> 30:26.192
It's not permanent.

30:26.194 --> 30:30.196
Cognition could revert back
in a few months.

30:30.198 --> 30:33.032
You would need someone patient
to help you relearn

30:33.034 --> 30:34.934
while the brain recovers
from surgery.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.606
The music comes from here.

30:42.742 --> 30:44.810
And that's where you live.

30:44.812 --> 30:48.213
The most beautiful pieces
I wrote, I wrote to you.

30:48.215 --> 30:50.816
If it comes to it,

30:50.818 --> 30:53.885
would you teach me
how to play them again?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.005
Alex: - Hey.

31:16.007 --> 31:17.506
I just came from recovery.

31:17.508 --> 31:20.109
Kim's doing well.
Thought you wanted to know.

31:20.111 --> 31:22.245
Best news I've heard all day.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.780
Wow.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.515
Considering your promotion
and your digs,

31:26.517 --> 31:28.184
that says a lot.

31:28.186 --> 31:31.221
I guess it just hasn't
really sunk in yet.

31:32.589 --> 31:34.089
What's that?

31:36.393 --> 31:38.560
I found it on the floor.

31:38.562 --> 31:40.028
It's Syd's handwriting,

31:40.030 --> 31:43.298
and I figured it's her goodbye letter.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.967
I can't bring myself to read it.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.169
I know you, Maggie,

31:47.171 --> 31:48.770
and I know what it looks like
when you're happy,

31:48.772 --> 31:49.871
and this last month

31:49.873 --> 31:51.739
is the happiest I have ever seen you.

31:53.442 --> 31:55.409
Do you think I made a mistake?

31:56.479 --> 31:58.612
Well, it depends.

31:58.614 --> 32:00.381
Jobs come and go,

32:00.383 --> 32:04.285
but love, it's...
well, it's hard to come by.

32:04.287 --> 32:07.921
Well, she was the one
who told me to stay.

32:07.923 --> 32:10.123
Her exact words were,
"Don't come with me."

32:10.125 --> 32:12.725
It doesn't get more clear than that.

32:12.727 --> 32:15.828
Unless this letter says differently.

32:27.975 --> 32:29.641
It's in Hebrew.

32:29.643 --> 32:30.876
Classic Katz.

32:32.746 --> 32:35.214
Writing me a letter I can't read.

32:37.952 --> 32:39.518
Let's get her to read it to you.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.751
Her flight hasn't left yet.

32:42.389 --> 32:44.755
Uh, there's no time.

32:44.757 --> 32:46.124
Ah, yes, there is.

32:46.126 --> 32:48.159
You just need a fast car and
somebody reckless to drive it.

32:49.896 --> 32:51.362
Oh, my God.

32:51.364 --> 32:53.631
Come on. Let's go.

32:57.604 --> 32:59.270
Zach!

32:59.272 --> 33:01.405
- Yeah?
- Did you drive today?

33:01.407 --> 33:03.474
No, I rode in
on my Penny Farthing.

33:03.476 --> 33:04.908
Yeah, I drove.

33:04.910 --> 33:06.709
Okay, great. I need your keys.

33:06.711 --> 33:07.910
Where's your motorcycle?

33:07.912 --> 33:09.279
I don't know if you've noticed,

33:09.281 --> 33:10.680
but I'm pregnant, so I sold it.

33:10.682 --> 33:11.648
No one saw that coming.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.316
Okay, not enough time. Keys!

33:13.318 --> 33:14.784
How am I supposed to get home?

33:14.786 --> 33:16.520
Hitch a ride with Dawn.

33:16.522 --> 33:18.255
It's not gonna happen.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.758
♪ We're riding on our horses,
our hands full of torches ♪

33:21.760 --> 33:23.759
I'm never gonna see you again.

33:23.761 --> 33:26.695
Your going to England, Lin, not Mars.

33:26.697 --> 33:28.930
I love you.

33:28.932 --> 33:31.267
You, too.

33:31.269 --> 33:33.402
- ♪ Come over, red rover, you're through ♪
Alex: - Okay, let's go!

33:33.404 --> 33:35.471
Now get out of my E.R.!

33:35.473 --> 33:40.375
♪ Not safe from the lure ♪

33:40.377 --> 33:44.712
♪ Not safe from ourselves ♪

33:44.714 --> 33:46.181
♪ It longs to be warm ♪

33:46.183 --> 33:48.616
I can't believe I'm the one
rushing to the airport for love.

33:48.618 --> 33:50.051
Why do you say that?

33:51.087 --> 33:52.520
Because you're the hopeless romantic.

33:52.522 --> 33:54.021
I'm always the bridesmaid.

33:54.023 --> 33:55.122
That is not true!

33:55.124 --> 33:56.956
You just hadn't met your one.

33:58.060 --> 34:00.927
Now my one is crossing
the pond without me.

34:00.929 --> 34:03.063
Well, she hasn't left yet.

34:03.065 --> 34:05.899
Thank you for doing this.

34:05.901 --> 34:10.204
You have been there for me
more times than I can count.

34:10.206 --> 34:13.672
Seriously, the only thing
bigger than your brain

34:13.675 --> 34:15.241
is your heart.

34:15.243 --> 34:17.643
I wish I could decide
which one I'm listening to.

34:17.645 --> 34:21.980
You showed me
not to be afraid of mine,

34:21.982 --> 34:25.751
not to mention a thing or two
in the O.R.

34:25.753 --> 34:28.821
There are no words.

34:28.822 --> 34:29.822
Don't worry.

34:29.824 --> 34:31.022
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

34:31.024 --> 34:32.090
We are coming to visit.

34:32.092 --> 34:34.359
You better.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
Or we won't make it,

34:35.362 --> 34:36.828
and you'll be stuck with me forever.

34:36.830 --> 34:37.929
Oh, no, no, no.

34:37.931 --> 34:39.931
I'm gonna get you there dead or alive,

34:39.933 --> 34:41.366
preferably alive.

34:49.375 --> 34:50.873
Hey.

34:54.045 --> 34:55.646
How you feeling, my love?

34:55.648 --> 34:57.147
Oh, I'm just tired.

34:57.149 --> 34:58.181
Yeah?

34:58.183 --> 34:59.550
Yeah.

34:59.552 --> 35:01.585
How's our little Sha-Nathan doing?

35:03.222 --> 35:07.823
I don't know if I can
be a father, Jonathan.

35:07.825 --> 35:10.360
You can only be great at one thing,

35:10.362 --> 35:13.463
and I'm already a great surgeon.

35:13.465 --> 35:15.431
So, that's it?

35:15.433 --> 35:19.034
Well, maybe in a few years
when things are less hectic.

35:19.036 --> 35:21.603
It won't be less hectic.
That's just life, Shahir.

35:21.605 --> 35:23.438
Well, maybe my life
doesn't include a child.

35:26.644 --> 35:27.743
I'm gonna go.

35:27.745 --> 35:30.845
Okay. I'll see you at home.

35:30.847 --> 35:32.847
Jonathan. Jon...

35:39.455 --> 35:40.721
Pick a card, any card.

35:40.723 --> 35:41.722
Oh, really?

35:41.724 --> 35:43.457
Really.

35:45.828 --> 35:47.695
Okay, put it back anywhere you like.

35:47.697 --> 35:48.696
Anywhere?

35:48.698 --> 35:50.030
Mm-hmm.

35:52.502 --> 35:54.902
Okay, so, Dr. Bell managed
to regulate your breathing,

35:54.904 --> 35:57.304
and it looks like your legs
are gonna make a full recovery.

35:58.640 --> 36:03.543
But I might not want to do
the Leap of Faith anytime soon.

36:03.545 --> 36:05.445
Well, between you and me, doctor,

36:05.447 --> 36:08.848
that illusion actually requires
very little leaping.

36:08.850 --> 36:10.750
No. No jumping at all.

36:12.553 --> 36:14.453
Why do I get the strange feeling
we've met before?

36:14.455 --> 36:16.322
'Cause we have,

36:16.324 --> 36:18.857
in the E.R.
when they brought you in.

36:18.859 --> 36:21.993
No, it's more than that. I don't know.

36:23.597 --> 36:24.596
Is that your card?

36:24.598 --> 36:29.000
No, actually. It's not.

36:29.002 --> 36:31.602
Well, don't feel bad.
You had a bit of a day.

36:31.604 --> 36:33.705
Geez, doc,
how many drugs did you give me?

36:33.707 --> 36:36.974
Well, we... we... Uh, okay.

36:36.976 --> 36:39.377
Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

36:39.379 --> 36:41.011
Not really.

36:41.013 --> 36:42.380
You got the real magic, man.

36:42.382 --> 36:45.149
You fixed me.

36:47.018 --> 36:49.285
Thanks.

36:54.593 --> 36:56.493
<i>Oh, look who it is!</i>

36:56.495 --> 36:57.861
<i>I know you've been avoiding me.</i>

36:57.863 --> 37:01.431
No. No one's been... avoiding you.

37:01.433 --> 37:05.468
It's just... It's been a busy day.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.903
Listen, you died.

37:07.905 --> 37:10.072
That doesn't mean you weren't loved

37:10.074 --> 37:11.707
or you won't be missed.

37:11.709 --> 37:15.310
<i>I'm just scared.</i>

37:15.312 --> 37:18.881
I know.

37:18.883 --> 37:20.615
But I don't know what happens next.

37:22.719 --> 37:27.522
You just think of someone you love

37:27.524 --> 37:28.823
and hope for the best...

37:31.828 --> 37:33.060
Duder.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.079
- Love you!
- Love you! Bye!

39:04.081 --> 39:06.414
Bye!

39:24.200 --> 39:26.233
Sydney: Hey, stranger.

39:26.235 --> 39:27.535
I thought you left.

39:27.537 --> 39:29.804
I did want to get on that plane.

39:29.806 --> 39:35.042
I was so mad and disappointed.

39:35.044 --> 39:36.676
I'm sorry.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.277
No, no, no, not at you...

39:38.279 --> 39:43.016
at myself for pushing you away.

39:45.521 --> 39:47.721
I'm so glad you came.

39:49.825 --> 39:51.257
I got your letter.

39:53.561 --> 39:55.961
I think the first word is "Shalom."

39:55.963 --> 39:57.863
Yeah.

39:57.865 --> 40:00.365
But it's really hard to find
someone who reads Hebrew.

40:00.367 --> 40:04.069
Yeah, 'cause there's no Jewish
doctors working at a hospital.

Nope.

40:08.576 --> 40:10.808
I was standing in that office,

40:10.810 --> 40:14.012
and it was everything I'd worked for.

40:14.014 --> 40:16.213
And all I could think about was you.

40:18.184 --> 40:21.185
I love you.

40:21.187 --> 40:25.189
And I'd give everything up
to be with you.

40:25.191 --> 40:28.825
I would, too.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.361
That's why I didn't get on the plane.

40:31.363 --> 40:35.165
I guess we both gave it all up.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.837
