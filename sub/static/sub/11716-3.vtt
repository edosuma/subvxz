WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.674
Ah, this is quite
the unexpected treat.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.175
The best part
is you're doing this

00:08.300 --> 00:10.093
solely out of the goodness
of your own heart

00:10.218 --> 00:12.387
with no expectations
of what's to follow.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.014
Oh, you couldn't
be more wrong.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.433
(CHUCKLES)

00:16.558 --> 00:18.310
I'm, uh
I'm angling for sex.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.562
(CHUCKLES)

00:20.688 --> 00:22.021
Well, you could get me
another glass of wine.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.023
I could
see this happening.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.485
I should go uncork
another bottle
of the yes juice.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.821
(LAUGHS)

00:28.946 --> 00:30.155
And I will be
waiting right here.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.742
Seriously, couch sex?

00:33.868 --> 00:35.953
Mmm, if your quads
are up for it.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.371
You kidding?
This is what we train for.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.001
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

00:44.795 --> 00:46.839
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:46.964 --> 00:47.923
Audrey,
I need to
talk to you.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.216
Oh, Liz, no, no.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.425
It's actually
not a great time...

00:51.969 --> 00:53.428
Get this party started.
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:53.554 --> 00:54.429
Oh, my God.
What the hell?

00:56.849 --> 00:57.850
There's been a death
in my family.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.019
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.186
Who was it?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.355
My cat Corny.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.650
Cat? Don't you have,
like, eight of 'em?

01:08.109 --> 01:10.863
Well, I do now.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.614
That's a real bummer.
Why don't you
head on out

01:12.740 --> 01:14.157
and Audrey
will be able to comfort you
in about five minutes.

01:17.077 --> 01:17.995
Ten minutes.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.584
I miss my puss puss.

01:25.168 --> 01:25.961
So do I.
Don't.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.799
I mean, I suppose
I should've
seen it coming.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.426
Forty eight hours
is a much longer nap

01:32.551 --> 01:33.802
than Corny
usually took, but...

01:35.554 --> 01:36.555
Poor Corny.

01:39.140 --> 01:39.892
Is there a dead cat
in that bag?

01:42.101 --> 01:44.688
Jeff, come on,
she's not insane.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.731
I thought you'd want
to say goodbye.
Oh.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.192
I would.
Goodbye, Liz.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.655
Jeff, your playful
badinage

01:53.781 --> 01:56.241
is really a life raft
of levity
in my ocean of despair.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.871
But I've come
to a conclusion.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.623
I'm gonna replace
the life I lost
with a new life.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.751
You're gonna get
another cat?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.753
No. I'm gonna
have a baby.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.967
A human baby?

02:17.679 --> 02:20.099
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:23.102 --> 02:25.437
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

02:27.397 --> 02:32.319
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:32.444 --> 02:35.280
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:46.125 --> 02:47.918
Hey, knock, knock.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.711
Who's there?
It's Timmy.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.882
What are you
doing here, dude?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.592
You're not usually
the happy hour
with coworkers type.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.137
Oh, I just thought
I'd pop in
and say hello.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.684
Oh, you dirty dog.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.978
You're after
the new girl,
Charlotte.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.604
Guilty as charged,
Mr. Rhodes.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.939
Ah, all right.
Well, get out there.

03:09.064 --> 03:09.773
Go over there
and work it.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.025
Oh, well...

03:11.150 --> 03:11.984
I said work it.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.447
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:17.572 --> 03:19.366
Charlotte, hello.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.284
Oh, hey, Timmy.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.495
You usually
don't do happy hour.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.497
Well, I figured
I was entitled

03:25.622 --> 03:26.665
to one hour
of happiness today.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.083
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

03:28.207 --> 03:30.127
Ah, who ordered
the ham on wry?

03:31.795 --> 03:35.049
Spelled wry.
No?

03:35.174 --> 03:35.924
All right then,
let me get you
another glass of wine.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.385
Excuse me.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.720
If I could perhaps
place an order for...

03:39.845 --> 03:41.013
Hey, barkeep,
can I get a cold one?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.097
You got it, buddy.
Thanks.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.098
Hey, Charlotte.
Hey.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.224
Hey, are you thirsty?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.768
Make it two.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.021
A cold beer
on a warm day,
so good.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.314
Am I right
or am right?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.900
You know, um,
that beer's actually
a hefeweizen,

03:53.025 --> 03:54.275
which is German for...

03:54.401 --> 03:55.235
Hey, come on,
I got a table over here.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.696
Yeast wheat.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.701
Jeez.
Bombs away, Timmy.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.703
What happened there?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.664
Joe happened.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.875
Seems he's the life
of the party.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.168
Hey, you are every bit
as fun and as cool
JOE: Hey, Adam.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.130
Oh, my God.
Joe's calling me over.
Wish me luck.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.388
(TAPPING)

04:24.806 --> 04:26.641
What are you doing?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.602
Adjusting the levels
of lemon and sugar.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.522
I like my iced tea
just right.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.234
Okay, Goldilocks.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.949
Well, my trip
to the sperm bank
was a bust.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.829
What was the problem?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.289
Well, they had a book
where you look
at donors' stats,

04:49.414 --> 04:52.126
like height and ethnicity,
but no photos.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.461
I mean, how do I know
what these guys
are really like?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.922
Ah, bunch of guys
rubbing one
out for cab fare,

04:57.047 --> 04:58.632
can't be a dud
in the bunch.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.220
So I got to thinking.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.680
What about one of them
I've already dated?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.849
Maybe one of them
would be willing
to be my baby daddy.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.560
(LAUGHS)
Okay, Liz.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.812
I think I know
where this is headed,

05:11.937 --> 05:13.105
but I'm sorry...

05:13.230 --> 05:14.481
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not asking you.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.110
Because you knew
I was gonna say no?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.444
Doesn't matter.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.488
I'm not asking.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.615
Well, for the record,
I said no first.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.908
To a question
I didn't ask.

05:26.994 --> 05:27.828
Okay.
You were saying?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.288
Anyway...
No.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.082
Go on.

05:34.168 --> 05:38.130
Anyway, one of my exes
never called me back.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.215
Another one
had his phone
disconnected.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.050
And another one's
brother answered

05:42.176 --> 05:44.343
and said that my ex
had just died,

05:44.469 --> 05:46.680
which was spooky
because his brother
sounded exactly like him.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.853
Wow.
That's bad... Luck.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.689
So who did you
end up finding?

05:55.814 --> 05:56.815
No one.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.358
No one, you say?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.323
No one whose seed
I'd like to plant
in my uterine garden.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.490
Oh, God.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.661
Well, I need to figure out
something and fast.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.039
I'm pushing 40.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.123
Sure you're not
pulling it?

06:13.248 --> 06:14.333
(CHUCKLES)

06:15.709 --> 06:17.336
Jeff, laugh out "l."

06:21.673 --> 06:23.091
Huh.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.343
Different way to go.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.347
Keep your phone
turned on.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.601
What's the matter,
Timmy?

06:33.727 --> 06:37.314
Ah, he's bummed
because he got shined
by some chick at work.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.025
Yes. I'm afraid
woe and me
are one in the same.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.863
Keep talking like that,
you're never
gonna get some.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.743
Jeff, maybe Timmy's goal
is not to "get some."

06:49.868 --> 06:51.703
I'm afraid getting some
is, indeed, my goal.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.540
Well, you know,
part of the problem

06:55.665 --> 06:58.126
is you're all,
"Chip, chip, cheerio.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.129
"Ooh, all's well.
(CHUCKLES)

07:01.255 --> 07:02.923
"Your virginity's safe
with me, milady."

07:05.217 --> 07:06.927
He's right,
if you wanna score
heavy with the ladies,

07:07.052 --> 07:09.971
you gotta be an alpha,
you gotta be the big dog.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.973
You know,
a guy guy's wanna be
and women wanna be with.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.853
Are you doing
a cologne ad?

07:20.607 --> 07:24.152
So um,
you've seen
this type of guy?

07:24.278 --> 07:25.237
I've got a mirror,
don't I?

07:25.362 --> 07:26.196
Oh.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.992
So uh, what's your secret
to being an alpha?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.827
Well, I'm a man
of few words.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.371
And this works?

07:38.666 --> 07:40.335
Ah, you're doing it
right now.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.629
Well done.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.756
See, the less you say,
the more people like you.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.258
Mmm-hmm.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.884
I like Jeff way better
when he's not talking.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.472
Timmy, you are great.
Just be yourself.
This girl will see that.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.641
That's a great plan

07:54.766 --> 07:55.350
if you wanna die
with your hand
wrapped around

07:55.475 --> 07:56.059
your business.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.604
I don't.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.400
I truly don't
want to die

08:03.524 --> 08:04.109
with my hand
wrapped around
my business.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.823
Hey.
Hey.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.199
Got a package for 9a.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.952
Really? What is it?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.787
They generally
don't let us
open the boxes and look.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.581
Oh, you're welcome
to stick around

08:18.706 --> 08:20.125
and find out,
if you're curious.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.293
I'm not.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.211
Eh.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.765
(GRUNTS)

08:35.890 --> 08:37.351
You think
you're better than me,
huh, box?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.647
(GRUNTS)

08:46.276 --> 08:47.986
Oh, has your mom's
wedding dress
arrived yet?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.654
No, but it should
any day now.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.490
Oh, I can't wait
to see it.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.158
I know.
I'm a little worried
about wearing it,

08:53.283 --> 08:54.701
because it's antique
and really delicate.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.869
(GRUNTING)

09:02.417 --> 09:03.918
Ah, that dress
has held up
all these years.

09:04.044 --> 09:04.919
I'm sure it'll be fine.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.280
Hi.
Hi.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.240
What are you doing?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.200
Just... Window.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.537
All right.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.787
Hey, did my dress
come yet?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.622
Dress?
Not that I'm aware of.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.583
Ugh. My mom
thought it'd arrive today.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.293
Well, sounds like
your mom's a liar.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.297
A liar?
That's just what
she thought.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.882
Really?
Well, maybe
you guys

09:51.007 --> 09:52.175
need to get
your story straight.

09:52.300 --> 09:52.384
Anyway, gotta rip.
Dress ya later.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.512
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:59.599 --> 10:00.683
Hey, Timmy,
what's going on?

10:00.808 --> 10:01.935
Ah, hello, Cha...

10:03.728 --> 10:04.687
'Sup?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.774
Whatcha eatin'?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.234
This.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.072
We're all going out
for happy hour again,
if you wanna come.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.160
You've been
really quiet today.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.245
Are you okay?

10:21.037 --> 10:21.871
Yep.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.209
Hey, Charlotte, Timmy,
what's going on?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.295
Hey, Joe.
Wanna join us for lunch?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.255
Oh, what,
in the stuffy break room?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.132
What do you say
we take lunch outside?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.633
Maybe hit the park,
get a little froyo?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.343
That sounds fun.
All right.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.844
I'll go round up
the troops.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.263
Hey, Timmy,
do you like
frozen yogurt?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.061
Okay.
See ya later.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.151
(EXHALES)

10:51.276 --> 10:53.361
One day closer
to the most
embarrassing death ever.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.284
Well, I've lost my faith
in the internet community.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.996
What happened?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.705
Well, I put an ad
on Craigslist

11:04.831 --> 11:06.500
to see if there were
any men who wanted

11:06.625 --> 11:08.042
to put a baby in me,
no questions asked.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.422
Oh, no. No, no.
Oh, yes.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.882
And this time
I remembered
to ask for pictures,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.009
which I got.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.639
Oh, God. Oh.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.890
All I got in my inbox
were a tsunami
of dong pics.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.145
Every response I click
is like a church bell.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.146
Dong.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.315
Dong.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.318
Dong.
Ugh.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.111
Dong.
Okay, all right.

11:35.236 --> 11:35.820
That's enough,
come on.
Ugh.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.031
Sorry I'm late.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.158
Yeah, you're not,
really.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.242
(CLEARS THROAT)
All right.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.953
So, Liz, listen.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.665
Having a baby
is a very big deal.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.249
I mean, Jeff and I
talked about it a lot.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.959
Well,
I mostly listened.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.921
You talked about
my situation?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.674
Well, yeah.
I mean, look at us.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.426
We are having our baby
in a nontraditional way,

11:58.552 --> 12:00.470
but we didn't
go with a stranger.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.347
We picked Brenda
as our surrogate,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.974
someone who's already
in our life,
someone we know.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.685
So you're saying
I should go with
someone I know?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.936
Exactly, yes.

12:09.062 --> 12:09.688
You agree,
right, Jeff?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.231
Yeah, sure.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.444
I think I understand
what you're saying.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.155
Jeff, I would be honored
to have you
put a baby in me.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.324
Ugh.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.039
So I'm following him
to your house
or my house?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.946
(GRUNTS)

13:00.655 --> 13:01.531
Come on.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.283
(GRUNTS)

13:04.743 --> 13:05.744
Ah!

13:08.955 --> 13:10.039
Drop it in your beer.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.249
Gives it a nice
little kick.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.877
Once again,
I'm at happy hour,

13:15.002 --> 13:17.380
being ignored while Joe
is the life of the party

13:17.505 --> 13:19.048
for telling everyone
to drop a jalapeno
in their beer.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.717
JEFF:  Oh, that's good.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.468
Gives it
a nice little kick.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.681
It sounds like
you gotta step up
your big dog move.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.725
'Cause when
push comes to shove,

13:28.849 --> 13:30.017
the alpha throws down
his credit card.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.438
With all due respect,
I've never
seen you do that.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.442
With me,
push never
comes to shove.

13:40.111 --> 13:40.819
All right, everyone.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.948
Drinks are on me.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.283
(CHEERING)

13:45.408 --> 13:46.618
Timmy!

13:46.743 --> 13:49.496
(ALL CHANTING) Timmy!

13:49.621 --> 13:51.956
Barkeep, tequila shots
for everyone.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.958
Fun idea, Joe.
Joe! Joe! Joe!

13:54.083 --> 13:55.752
(ALL CHANTING) Joe!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.258
What happened?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.344
So it's noticeable?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.554
Yes.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.222
Look, you gotta
help me.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.767
I mean, I guess I know
some costume designers

14:10.891 --> 14:12.185
from my magazine days
who could maybe
do something,

14:12.310 --> 14:13.936
but it ain't
gonna be cheap.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.396
Ii don't care
what it costs.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.650
Maybe don't
say that to them.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.406
What, are you buying
a clarinet?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.369
Oh, no.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.793
So, hear you're not
having too much luck

14:36.917 --> 14:38.503
in your quest
for a stud.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.466
I am not,
and time's running out.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.051
You know,
I'm pushing 40.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.678
(CHUCKLES)
As am I.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.097
Anyway,
I've pretty much
exhausted

14:50.223 --> 14:51.891
all my options
for a donor.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.434
Oh, have you?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.644
All of them?

14:56.855 --> 14:57.856
Oh, you're right,
I haven't.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.357
Mmm-hmm.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.817
What's Timmy's
cell phone number?

15:00.941 --> 15:03.944
What?
Timmy?
My Timmy?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.739
What are you talking about?
Are you serious?

15:05.864 --> 15:06.906
What are you
trying to say,
little man?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.993
Not that I'd want to,

15:11.118 --> 15:13.037
but why wouldn't you
ask me?

15:14.288 --> 15:15.707
Well, nothing personal,
but I was just

15:15.832 --> 15:17.166
looking for someone
a little more...

15:19.043 --> 15:20.002
Way better than you.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.591
I get that.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.386
And I wanted someone
with good genes.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.346
I come from good stock.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.972
I know.
That's why
I asked your dad.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.352
You know what?
You're lucky
he turned you down.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.480
He wasn't exactly
father of the year.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.940
I don't know
where he got
that coffee mug.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.279
Russell,
are you volunteering
to father my child?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.281
No, I'm just
saying that

15:48.406 --> 15:49.908
I have thought

15:50.032 --> 15:52.619
that it might be nice
to maybe have

15:52.744 --> 15:54.746
a little Russell Junior
running around the world.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.249
I am in my
ovulation window.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.168
Yuck.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.671
Oh, what the hell?
Let's go do this.

16:03.797 --> 16:04.881
All right!

16:07.341 --> 16:10.428
Wait, did you really
ask my dad?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.430
Yeah, and he said
having kids was
the worst thing he ever did.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.939
Audrey, thank you.
Thank you, again.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.858
Your friend totally
fixed the dress.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.985
You know,
I had to split it over
a couple credit cards

16:26.110 --> 16:27.570
'cause my cash
is all tied up
in the wedding

16:27.695 --> 16:28.780
and these new hair care
products I'm into, so...

16:31.407 --> 16:32.700
(DOOR RATTLING)

16:32.826 --> 16:34.034
Oh, look,
I gotta go, gotta go.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.579
Hey.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.456
Guess what finally came.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.125
My wedding dress!
Yeah.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.800
Mmm,
that's how you do it.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.097
Ah, wow, she did do
a great job.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.142
Who did?

16:58.267 --> 17:01.604
Pfft, your mom
did a great job
of mailing it.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.522
I mean, it's, like,
totally here.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.276
Mmm?
Wait a minute.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.904
This is the dress
from her first marriage.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.030
She was supposed to send
the one from her second.
I'll go call her.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.992
Wait a minute. Wait.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.660
So you're not
gonna wear this?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.077
God, no.
It looks so cheap.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.714
Yes, hi.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.798
I'd like to report
several stolen credit cards.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.803
All right, big boy,
you ready to do this?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.054
Oh, yes.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.556
Me too.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.098
Let's make a baby.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.350
(LAUGHS)

17:44.939 --> 17:45.773
RUSSELL: Ah.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.906
Well, it doesn't
feel like you're ready.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.201
(SIGHS)

17:59.119 --> 18:03.332
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Bingham.
What brings you here?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.209
Oh, Jeff just decided
to take me out to dinner.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.878
Mmm,
what's the occasion?

18:07.003 --> 18:08.421
Did you throw down
that credit card?

18:08.546 --> 18:09.714
Yes, but I'm afraid...

18:09.839 --> 18:11.340
We'd like two steaks,
all the trimmings.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.341
Put it on
this guy's tab.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.805
Uh, so how's the whole
alpha guy
situation going?

18:17.931 --> 18:18.806
Not well, actually.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.182
If you're not an alpha,

18:20.307 --> 18:21.475
people are gonna
walk all over you.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.394
A bottle of your
finest cabernet.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.186
(WHISPERS)
Same tab.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.399
You know, Timmy,
I was against this
from the start.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.777
Because I don't think
you need to change
at all.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.695
I mean,
if you like this girl,
don't play games.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.988
Just be yourself.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.031
Tell her how you feel.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.658
Thank you, Miss Bingham.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.368
You're quite right.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.245
Pardon me.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.167
Um, Charlotte,
might I have a word,
please?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.461
Oh, of course, Timmy.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.256
I've done a lot
of thinking recently

18:52.381 --> 18:55.051
about how
one person conveys
their feelings to another.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.052
I've been
thinking about that too.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.263
Really?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.682
Well, um,
I've come to realize

19:01.808 --> 19:03.392
that it's best
to just be direct,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.478
and lay one's feelings
on the line.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.188
You know what?
That makes
a lot of sense.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.565
Oh, I'm so glad
to hear you
say that because...

19:09.690 --> 19:11.776
Joe, I really like you
and was wondering

19:11.901 --> 19:13.319
if maybe you'd like
to go on a date with me.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.988
Yeah,
of course I would.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.114
Did not
see that coming.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.866
I did.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.955
And I, uh,
couldn't do it.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.414
(CHUCKLES)

19:25.539 --> 19:27.083
Turns out
the old Russell muscle

19:27.207 --> 19:29.085
can't be used for good,
only evil.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.630
Are you sure
that's it?

19:32.755 --> 19:35.215
Maybe it can't be used
at all anymore.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.927
Oh, yeah.
I was worried
about that too,

19:38.052 --> 19:41.347
so uh,
later that night
I ran some diagnostics.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.475
Ugh.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.770
Russell.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.563
Elizabeth.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.734
Big news.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.652
We're pregnant!

19:55.402 --> 19:57.279
BOTH: What?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.866
No, I thought
Russell couldn't...

19:59.991 --> 20:01.951
Oh, I'm not pregnant,
not with this
wet noodle over here.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.038
Then who's pregnant?

20:05.163 --> 20:07.665
Cotton!
She's having kittens.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.791
Cotton, wasn't that
the dead one in the bag?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.506
No, Jeff,
that was Corny.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.465
Keep up!

20:17.967 --> 20:18.926
No offense.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.977
I can't believe
Timmy actually died
like that.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.648
I can't believe
the mortician

20:32.773 --> 20:33.524
couldn't pry his hand
off it.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.361
I can't believe
they opted for
an open casket.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.447
They didn't.
I propped it open.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.615
Hilarious.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.785
Oh, Timmy.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.913
Oh, Timmy.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.039
(CHUCKLES)
Meow, meow.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.544
Wow, Timmy,
I always thought
you were such a great...

20:53.669 --> 20:55.379
Oh, Charlotte and Joe
are here!

20:56.714 --> 20:59.299
Poor Timmy.
Yeah.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.551
Charlotte,
will you marry me?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.011
Yes!

21:02.136 --> 21:03.512
(ALL CHANTING) Joe!

21:04.931 --> 21:05.848
(GASPS)
