00:19.929 --> 00:21.329
So that's it, then?

00:21.730 --> 00:24.149
That's your exciting plan
for this evening? A book?

00:24.730 --> 00:27.429
- I get enough excitement.
- Of the evil-fighting variety.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.500
- But how about a little off-duty fun?
- Such as?

00:32.530 --> 00:33.969
Two beautiful words:

00:34.329 --> 00:36.009
Sports bar.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.369
They have trivia games
on the Internet now.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.090
You can challenge drunks
around the world.

00:44.530 --> 00:46.630
Anything! I just can't
sit around while--

00:47.530 --> 00:50.689
While I steal into the night with
my more-wealthy-than-you prince?

00:51.130 --> 00:53.619
Makes your little life
look a tad drab, doesn't it?

00:54.130 --> 00:56.299
His wealth won't necessarily
make you happy.

00:57.130 --> 01:00.179
Pierce has a lot more than money.
He has a home in Montecito...

01:00.729 --> 01:04.629
...a Mercedes CLK 320 and a place
in the Hills with a lap pool.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.760
Since you put it that way.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.140
If I'm not here in the morning,
clear out my desk.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.959
I'll be moving on up.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.530
Wow. You look amazing.

01:23.530 --> 01:25.989
Do I? Great. Let's go.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.590
What's your hurry?
You didn't even introduce us.

01:31.329 --> 01:33.120
Angel. Doyle. Pierce. Bye.

01:33.129 --> 01:34.459
You work, Pierce?

01:34.930 --> 01:37.000
I trade.
Futures and options markets.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.400
Good, good. Out for dinner?

01:40.329 --> 01:41.730
Le Petit Renard.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.129
Oh, right. Nice spot. Duck is dry.

01:45.129 --> 01:46.430
So how late will you be?

01:46.930 --> 01:48.159
Don't wait up.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.329
Don't mind them.

01:52.329 --> 01:55.560
She won't fall for my ample
but unpretentious charms, will she?

01:56.530 --> 01:59.269
If that means you don't brag
about your family's old money.

01:59.530 --> 02:02.510
The only money in my family is
underneath the couch cushions.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.640
And half of them are demons.

02:06.129 --> 02:09.680
If Cordy found out about that,
my chances would be worse than zero.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.400
Wow!

02:17.530 --> 02:18.580
She's something.

02:18.729 --> 02:21.610
- This an old squeeze of yours?
- Yeah.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.680
How does she feel about men
with an Irish accent?

02:27.729 --> 02:28.599
Buffy?

02:29.530 --> 02:30.610
Yeah.

02:38.530 --> 02:39.759
I'm sorry.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.280
- There's a young guy.
- Where?

02:46.930 --> 02:48.400
Vampires have a nest downtown.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.740
Poor kid's gonna be the entrée.

02:52.930 --> 02:54.189
Let's go. Come on.

02:57.729 --> 02:59.590
Everybody's got dinner plans but us.

03:50.849 --> 03:52.289
You have to study weather trends...

03:52.650 --> 03:54.789
...to make a good play
in agriculture markets.

03:55.050 --> 03:58.310
And once you do, you'll never look
at a soybean the same way again.

03:59.849 --> 04:01.219
God. Listen to me.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.069
- I'm not boring you, am I?
- I don't mind.

04:04.650 --> 04:07.460
Like today, there was heavy trading,
lean hog options.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.719
The spread dropped about 1700 points.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.860
I mean, in November,
it was at six cents.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.509
So I sold at
six and an eighth of a cent.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.209
Six and an eighth.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.339
Can you imagine anything
more exciting than that?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.480
Let's get out of here!

04:46.050 --> 04:47.589
Man, I hate that.

04:54.449 --> 04:55.990
I was about to do that.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.689
Better get this guy home.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.689
- You're stronger when you're a demon.
- I don't like to fight like that.

05:03.449 --> 05:07.240
- Nobody expects you to fight fair.
- It's just not my style. That's all.

05:07.649 --> 05:10.110
- You want me to go with you?
- I can handle it.

05:40.050 --> 05:43.029
I'm sorry you're sick.
I was hoping we'd make a night of it.

05:43.649 --> 05:46.139
Me too. I really wanted to hear
the end of the story...

05:46.649 --> 05:48.120
...about the pigs and beans.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.029
Don't you want me to take you home?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.939
- My car's here.
- Oh, wait. Let me walk you.

05:56.850 --> 05:59.870
I'm not really sure
about this neighborhood.

06:01.050 --> 06:02.699
You're right. It's crappy.

06:16.050 --> 06:16.920
Hey!

06:17.850 --> 06:19.709
I'm the one you followed here.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.529
Stay close. You'll get your turn.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.759
Are you okay?

07:04.050 --> 07:06.009
I'm fine. That was....

07:07.649 --> 07:09.160
You were so brave.

07:09.449 --> 07:11.480
Say that again without so much shock.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.389
You're stepping on my manliness.

07:13.649 --> 07:14.879
I'm sorry.

07:15.449 --> 07:16.529
- I'm just--
- Surprised?

07:18.449 --> 07:19.459
Grateful.

07:23.050 --> 07:26.350
So here I am at Le Petit Renard
with Mr. Armani...

07:27.250 --> 07:30.129
...who could keep me in blue boxes
for the rest of my life.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.009
Blue boxes?

07:32.050 --> 07:34.079
Tiffany's. God!

07:35.050 --> 07:36.939
The whole night, I was bored silly.

07:37.449 --> 07:39.240
I thought, if this wimp
saw a monster...

07:39.250 --> 07:41.949
...he'd probably throw a shoe at it
and run like a weasel.

07:42.850 --> 07:45.060
The shoe part was giving him
too much credit.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.639
There aren't very many people
who wouldn't run.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.600
Yeah. But all of a sudden,
rich and handsome isn't enough for me.

07:53.649 --> 07:57.129
Now I expect a guy to be all brave
and interesting. It's your fault.

07:58.449 --> 07:59.750
Both of you.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.250
Maybe you're changing.
That could be good.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.319
Or disastrous.
As if I wasn't confused enough...

08:06.250 --> 08:08.740
...then Doyle comes along
and rescues me...

08:09.250 --> 08:11.279
...like some badly dressed superhero.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.129
He was really beat up.

08:15.850 --> 08:17.920
But you know the first thing he asked?

08:18.850 --> 08:20.079
"Are you okay?"

08:21.250 --> 08:22.300
I mean, that's like...

08:23.050 --> 08:24.939
...substance, right?

08:26.050 --> 08:28.930
Well, there's definitely
more to Doyle than meets the eye.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.550
So I've gotta kill myself.

08:32.049 --> 08:34.049
I swore when I went out
with Xander Harris...

08:34.450 --> 08:36.659
...I'd rather die than date
a fixer-upper again.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.639
Still, maybe you're right.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.808
Maybe Doyle does have hidden depths.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.129
I mean, really, really hidden,
but depths.

08:45.850 --> 08:48.480
I have to buy him a mochaccino
for saving my life.

08:49.450 --> 08:51.340
- Well, I--
- We'll be back in a half.

08:51.850 --> 08:53.320
You watch the phones, okay?

08:55.450 --> 08:58.639
I'm the one you followed.
It's me you want. Huh?

09:00.850 --> 09:03.340
Fangs for the memories, vamp man.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.559
Hey, I was just....

09:10.450 --> 09:13.710
- You know, that was--
- An incredible spaz attack? Good.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.330
So you were....

09:18.250 --> 09:22.289
- what can I do for you?
- Well, I was thinking...

09:23.649 --> 09:27.230
...that maybe I haven't been
entirely fair to you.

09:28.450 --> 09:31.399
Maybe you don't
actually have zero potential.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.169
Wow, Cordelia. Thanks.

09:33.850 --> 09:34.929
That's not--

09:36.250 --> 09:37.860
What I'm trying to say is...

09:38.649 --> 09:41.279
...that I really appreciate
what you did last night.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.820
And I was thinking...

09:44.649 --> 09:46.090
...maybe we could--

09:46.450 --> 09:48.379
This is Angel Investigations.

09:48.850 --> 09:52.259
But we're in the middle of something.
Can you give us five minutes?

09:54.250 --> 09:55.370
Hey, Francis.

09:58.450 --> 09:59.460
Harry.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.509
Francis?

10:02.649 --> 10:04.299
Where have you been?

10:05.049 --> 10:06.169
Around.

10:06.850 --> 10:10.149
Kiribati, Togo, Uzbekistan.

10:11.049 --> 10:14.210
And a few spots
that were a little less touristy.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.549
Who's Francis?

10:17.649 --> 10:19.049
That would be me.

10:20.649 --> 10:22.370
Allen Francis Doyle.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.110
Cordelia...

10:29.649 --> 10:30.879
...this is Harry...

10:32.649 --> 10:33.519
...my wife.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.490
Sorry about the surprise.

10:45.049 --> 10:46.240
I would've called first...

10:46.850 --> 10:48.600
- ...but I was afraid--
- I'd run off?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.789
- It's not my style. Remember?
- But it's mine?

10:51.649 --> 10:55.340
Do you want me to remind you
who fired the starter pistol?

10:55.850 --> 10:56.899
No.

10:57.649 --> 10:58.850
Let's not, okay?

10:58.850 --> 11:01.409
Let's just hug
and be happy to see each other.

11:09.049 --> 11:11.259
- You look good.
- Yep, you too.

11:12.049 --> 11:14.330
Still living it up?
Drinking's no good for you.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.730
You know me, I'm a fun-loving guy.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.750
- What's going on?
- Angel, come meet Doyle's wife.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.629
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.360
Cool offices.

11:24.649 --> 11:26.970
I'm a private investigator.
This is my company.

11:27.649 --> 11:29.230
These two are my helpers.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.340
That-- Ouch.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.570
You two were married?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.279
Were and still,
according to the paperwork.

11:39.649 --> 11:42.980
- So it was a green-card thing.
- Nope. It was a madly-in-love...

11:43.850 --> 11:46.019
...couldn't-live-without-
each-other kind of thing.

11:46.850 --> 11:50.220
I guess times change. Here we are,
four years later, living just fine.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.700
So why are you here, exactly?

11:53.450 --> 11:55.169
Maybe we could talk alone.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.470
- You were gonna stay in the car.
- I know, but I admit...

12:03.049 --> 12:05.509
...curiosity got the better of me.
Richard Straley.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.730
I've heard so much about you.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.409
You didn't tell me
how handsome he was.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.100
- I'm not--
- No, you are. Really.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.740
I'm not Doyle. He is.

12:18.649 --> 12:19.629
That's more like it.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.480
Not that you're not
a very good-looking man.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.740
Richard, just shake his hand.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.230
Sorry, I'm not myself,
what with the wedding a few days off.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.210
There's a wedding?

12:34.850 --> 12:38.820
- I wasn't supposed to say that yet?
- No, please. Go on.

12:39.649 --> 12:41.720
Cordelia, let's go
through those reports.

12:42.049 --> 12:44.789
What? What reports? What?

12:46.250 --> 12:49.620
- I just--
- Hon-bun, I'll handle this from here.

12:50.450 --> 12:52.480
Sorry. I just want us
all to be friends.

12:52.850 --> 12:53.929
And we will be.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.490
- But I need a moment alone with him.
- Sure. You got it.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.320
- "Hon-bun"?
- I didn't want you to hear it that way.

13:06.649 --> 13:09.039
- You're marrying that guy?
- I know, it's wild, huh?

13:09.649 --> 13:12.320
I'm definitely the yin to his yang.
But it works.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.110
He's got a good heart, just like you.

13:15.649 --> 13:16.850
Maybe, but the container:

13:16.850 --> 13:18.919
"Can I get a side of bland
with that bland?"

13:19.850 --> 13:21.220
I'm not here for your approval.

13:21.649 --> 13:24.950
Then why? To see my face when
I found out? See if it cut?

13:25.850 --> 13:27.220
Of course not.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.860
I would never.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.440
I just....

13:35.450 --> 13:37.059
I need you to sign these.

13:42.049 --> 13:43.519
Divorce papers.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.960
It had to happen. One of us--

13:46.250 --> 13:49.799
Maybe I should get my people to look
over these before I go ahead...

13:51.049 --> 13:53.580
...and just make sure I'm not buying
an ostrich farm.

13:54.049 --> 13:55.210
Sure.

13:55.850 --> 13:59.259
Tell your people that I'll come back
for them in a few days.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.419
It's good to see you again, Francis.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.789
It's Doyle now.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.509
It's just Doyle.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.820
No?

14:34.370 --> 14:35.669
Harry's right.

14:36.169 --> 14:37.850
This stuff does me no good.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.809
So, you two hadn't been in touch
at all since you split up?

14:47.570 --> 14:49.149
Oh, the end was rough.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.970
We weren't even 20
when we got married.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.250
Crazy about each other.

14:55.970 --> 14:58.000
When things go wrong,
you don't say:

14:58.970 --> 15:02.590
"Thanks for the blender.
I wish you well." You fight.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.870
You tear each other apart
until one of you can't take it.

15:07.970 --> 15:09.159
She did the walking.

15:09.769 --> 15:12.610
But she had reason.
I wasn't exactly the man she married.

15:13.970 --> 15:16.570
- I changed.
- You were kids. It's only natural.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.690
To sneeze and sprout demon face?
That's decidedly unnatural.

15:21.169 --> 15:22.470
You didn't tell her?

15:23.570 --> 15:24.899
I didn't know.

15:25.970 --> 15:27.690
I never met my dad.

15:27.769 --> 15:28.779
He was the demon.

15:30.169 --> 15:32.700
My mom figured she'd wait to see
if I got his genes...

15:33.169 --> 15:34.639
...before she got confessional.

15:34.970 --> 15:38.690
- So your demon self didn't present--
- Until I was 21.

15:40.370 --> 15:44.690
And Harry and I were talking
about having kids of our own.

15:48.769 --> 15:50.700
Put a damper on that discussion.

15:51.169 --> 15:52.429
That's tough.

15:54.169 --> 15:55.039
I'm sorry.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.120
It's probably best in the long run.

15:59.570 --> 16:02.549
I'm too much of a wild man
to be the stay-at-home type anyway.

16:03.769 --> 16:05.139
This Richard, he looks like...

16:05.570 --> 16:07.600
- ...he could give her a good life.
- Yeah.

16:08.570 --> 16:12.220
Seems like a nice, friendly fella.
Don't you think?

16:12.769 --> 16:14.309
Definitely friendly.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.039
Only, he seemed a bit--

16:16.370 --> 16:18.049
Exactly! I knew he was no good.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.000
Even though we're ex, it's still
my duty to watch over her, right?

16:22.970 --> 16:25.710
But I can't go trailing
after her intended myself.

16:27.169 --> 16:28.610
Just wouldn't look right.

16:31.370 --> 16:32.840
- Do you think you would--?
- Yeah.

16:33.769 --> 16:36.789
Just don't tell Cordelia.
She'll want to charge you.

18:05.369 --> 18:07.400
You can't wait to see
what I just bought.

18:08.369 --> 18:10.369
What is it? For the honeymoon?

18:10.769 --> 18:13.160
How small do you think a nightie
would have to be...

18:13.769 --> 18:15.380
...to fit into
one of these tiny boxes?

18:16.170 --> 18:17.500
Yes.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.710
Don't move. I'll be right back.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.400
What are you doing?

18:51.569 --> 18:52.900
Right there, pumpkin.

19:01.769 --> 19:03.490
- Angel, stop!
- He's a demon!

19:03.569 --> 19:05.150
Well, yeah.

19:06.569 --> 19:07.650
You know?

19:07.769 --> 19:08.890
Honey.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.450
- He had a knife.
- That was for the box strings.

19:13.170 --> 19:14.960
What about the package from that man?

19:15.569 --> 19:17.359
You followed him?

19:17.970 --> 19:21.200
That was for the restaurant.
We serve a lot of delicacies:

19:22.170 --> 19:24.980
Frogs' legs, quail tongues,
which isn't illegal per se--

19:25.170 --> 19:26.960
You don't have to explain, Richard.

19:27.569 --> 19:29.529
Doyle put you up to this, right?

19:29.970 --> 19:33.940
Man! Years go by, nothing changes.
Doyle decides what I need--

19:34.769 --> 19:36.980
Now, now.
It's understandable, honey.

19:37.769 --> 19:40.369
He can't help but want to know
you'll be in good hands.

19:40.769 --> 19:44.250
I am in the best hands. Richard
and his family own this restaurant.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.900
They're Ano-Movic demons.
Peaceful clan.

19:47.369 --> 19:49.230
Totally assimilated into our culture.

19:49.769 --> 19:51.559
Harry is an ethnodemonologist.

19:52.170 --> 19:55.289
We met while she was scouting clans
in North America.

19:55.769 --> 19:57.910
You study demons?
That's your profession?

19:58.170 --> 20:02.069
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, I just.... Doyle said--

20:02.970 --> 20:05.250
That when he went through his change,
I freaked.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.809
Which is true. But after, I adjusted,
and I realized...

20:09.569 --> 20:13.680
...here's this whole rich, interesting
world just waiting to be explored.

20:14.369 --> 20:17.140
- But you didn't tell him that.
- Of course I did.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.460
I even tried to get him
to go out, meet other demons.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.529
But he couldn't accept himself.
Or them.

20:24.569 --> 20:27.549
So then he was just angry
and pretty much a bitch to live with.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.920
He's a demon? And she's
all signed on to be Mrs. Demon?

20:33.569 --> 20:36.690
- Tell me again how ugly he is.
- Here it is. Ano-Movic.

20:37.769 --> 20:41.279
"Once a nomadic tribe. At one point,
they did have violent leanings."

20:41.970 --> 20:45.660
I knew that nice-guy routine was
an act. He's working a spell on her.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.099
She's gonna sprout hubcaps
from her head.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.819
"--gave up those orthodox teachings,
language...

20:50.970 --> 20:52.410
...around the turn of the century."

20:52.769 --> 20:56.140
Now they own a number of restaurants
with pretty expensive windows.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.619
I intend to chip in on that.

20:59.970 --> 21:02.990
All that time, Harry was going on
about what an amazing thing...

21:03.569 --> 21:06.099
...my demon half could be,
the worlds it opened up to us.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.099
I thought she was just trying
to make me feel better.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.029
I thought she was pitying me.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.299
But it was true.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.150
I just wasn't listening.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.759
Harry didn't leave
because of the demon in me.

21:27.569 --> 21:29.220
She left because of me.

21:49.890 --> 21:52.140
- Thank you, Doyle.
- Yes. Thank you.

21:52.289 --> 21:53.369
You don't know what this means to me.

21:54.089 --> 21:57.809
I guess you do, seeing as you were
married once, to Harry no less.

21:58.289 --> 22:00.779
- Do you have a copier?
- Yeah. It's in Angel's office.

22:01.289 --> 22:02.799
Cordelia will help you.

22:07.289 --> 22:09.319
Harry's an amazing girl, isn't she?

22:10.890 --> 22:13.240
Doyle, I'm glad we have
some man-to-man time.

22:13.890 --> 22:16.059
Richard wanted a moment
alone with Doyle...

22:16.890 --> 22:18.500
...to ask him to his bachelor party.

22:18.690 --> 22:21.289
Why? Is he afraid he ordered
too much beer?

22:21.690 --> 22:25.759
Richard and his family want Doyle's
blessing. They're sweet demons...

22:27.089 --> 22:28.809
...very into good vibes all around.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.009
They do sound nice.

22:30.690 --> 22:33.180
His mom told me to invite friends
to my shower...

22:33.690 --> 22:35.440
...but I've only been
hanging with her.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.859
You're the first girl I've met here
under 370 years old.

22:39.089 --> 22:40.349
- Do you want--?
- I'd love to.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.190
It would mean a lot to me...

22:42.690 --> 22:45.880
...but, more than that, it would mean
the world to Harry if you came.

22:51.690 --> 22:53.650
Do we have to have the buffalo wings?

22:54.089 --> 22:56.119
We could have a foie gras.

22:56.490 --> 22:57.890
It's a bachelor party, Rich.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.539
You're supposed to eat bad
and drink beer.

23:01.289 --> 23:03.890
Don't forget the girl
who does the striptease.

23:06.089 --> 23:08.230
What? Like I don't know.

23:10.289 --> 23:13.589
- Just make sure all she does is tease.
- Mom, I don't even want--

23:13.890 --> 23:17.150
It's your party and we're gonna
have fun whether you like it or not.

23:18.089 --> 23:21.180
I just hope it doesn't create
a bad impression with Doyle.

23:21.690 --> 23:23.650
- Who's Doyle?
- Harry's first husband.

23:24.089 --> 23:25.099
Richard invited him.

23:25.289 --> 23:28.200
He's really very sweet.
I think you'll all enjoy him.

23:29.490 --> 23:32.650
All right. Fine, fine.
Dancing girl. I submit.

23:33.089 --> 23:34.140
Now, where were we?

23:34.289 --> 23:37.799
Oh, let's see.
First we greet the man of the hour.

23:39.089 --> 23:42.990
Then we drink,
bring out the food, then drink.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.289
Then comes the stripper.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.559
Darts...

23:46.890 --> 23:49.490
...the ritual eating
of the first husband's brains...

23:50.490 --> 23:51.470
...and then charades.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.430
Wait. What was that?

23:54.690 --> 23:56.759
- Charades?
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

23:57.690 --> 23:59.369
Really? I think it'd be fun.

24:00.089 --> 24:01.140
All right.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.920
- Hey, Francis.
- Doyle.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.069
Oh, sorry, sorry. Everybody...

24:25.210 --> 24:27.140
- ...this is Doyle.
- Hey, Doyle.

24:27.609 --> 24:29.220
And he brought someone.

24:30.609 --> 24:32.470
Angel? Hey, this is a surprise.

24:33.009 --> 24:35.079
Yeah, I thought I'd use
the door this time.

24:36.009 --> 24:36.990
I asked him to come.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.819
- I hope that's okay.
- Sure it is.

24:39.009 --> 24:41.039
Now the party can really start, huh?

24:42.009 --> 24:44.500
This night is for Doyle
as much as it is for me.

24:45.009 --> 24:47.259
More, even.
He's the real bachelor here.

24:47.410 --> 24:49.509
Thanks for not rubbing that in,
by the way.

24:50.410 --> 24:51.990
Let's set you up with a beverage.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.170
To Harry.

25:12.009 --> 25:13.089
Harry.

25:21.609 --> 25:23.009
What was she like, Doyle?

25:25.210 --> 25:26.720
- Like?
- Back in the old days.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.940
The years you had with her, the ones
I missed. Tell me everything.

25:31.809 --> 25:32.819
It was a nightmare.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.339
Well, maybe not at first.

25:34.809 --> 25:37.900
Initially, I really liked
the way he took charge.

25:38.410 --> 25:39.990
Doyle? Took charge?

25:40.809 --> 25:43.410
It was sweet.
But after a while, I mean...

25:43.809 --> 25:45.670
...I know how to cut
my own meat, thanks.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.529
Sometimes, it felt
like I was one of his students.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.950
For a moment, I thought you said
one of Doyle's students?

25:52.210 --> 25:54.809
It wasn't fun being treated
like a third grader.

25:55.809 --> 25:59.670
Grade third taught Doyle.
Doyle taught third grade?

26:00.609 --> 26:02.819
- The kind with children?
- Well, yeah.

26:03.009 --> 26:05.400
He wasn't held back
and used that as a cover story?

26:06.609 --> 26:10.230
Francis got his teaching credentials
before we even met at the food bank.

26:10.809 --> 26:11.859
Okay. Soup kitchen.

26:12.009 --> 26:15.099
Now that sounds like the Doyle
I've come to know and revile.

26:15.609 --> 26:18.700
- You're about to tell me he ran it.
- He was just a volunteer.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.319
That's where he got the idea...

26:21.609 --> 26:23.960
...for the "We Are The World" thing.
I'm kidding.

26:24.609 --> 26:27.839
Come on, girls.
It's pornographic Pictionary time.

26:30.009 --> 26:32.180
Their ways are not our ways.

26:59.650 --> 27:02.250
I have a confession to make.
Ever since I learned...

27:03.250 --> 27:06.660
...that Harry was married, I felt
like I've been living in your shadow.

27:08.049 --> 27:09.799
- Really?
- You were something...

27:09.849 --> 27:11.599
...I can never be for her.

27:12.849 --> 27:14.109
Her first.

27:15.849 --> 27:17.740
She'll always love you, Francis.

27:18.849 --> 27:19.789
Always.

27:22.450 --> 27:24.589
But she needs different things now.

27:24.849 --> 27:28.569
I know I can make her happy.
But I need you to be a part of it.

27:29.650 --> 27:30.589
Me?

27:32.650 --> 27:34.609
I have to have your blessing, Doyle.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.920
Without it,
there won't be any marriage.

27:39.849 --> 27:40.970
It's time, dude.

27:41.049 --> 27:43.539
Oh, fellas.

27:57.849 --> 27:58.930
Are you okay?

28:01.450 --> 28:02.529
Yeah.

29:20.849 --> 29:22.990
- Hello?
- It's Angel. Where are you?

29:23.849 --> 29:27.220
In another world known
as the 818 area code. Why?

29:27.450 --> 29:28.779
Let me speak to Harry,

29:30.450 --> 29:31.640
Hang on.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.500
It's for you. It's Angel.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.230
Hello?

29:39.450 --> 29:40.779
How's your Aratuscan?

29:41.250 --> 29:44.230
Rusty, considering
it's a dead demonic language.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.549
Guess again. I need a translation.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.329
What's going on, Angel?

29:52.049 --> 29:53.799
I don't know yet.
Look into it for me.

29:55.650 --> 29:59.299
I guess I could check
the family library.

29:59.849 --> 30:01.009
Thanks.

30:04.650 --> 30:05.700
Oh, hey. Excuse me.

30:05.849 --> 30:08.019
- What's your problem?
- There's no problem.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.740
- Are you disrespecting me?
- No.

30:11.250 --> 30:12.619
So now I'm a liar?

30:49.650 --> 30:51.160
Man can't hold his liquor.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.640
See you later.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.759
Thanks a lot, fellas.

30:59.849 --> 31:02.099
I hope Harry doesn't hear about that.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.859
Not from me she won't.

31:04.650 --> 31:07.670
Yeah, I know. You're a good half-man.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.170
So have you given any thought
to what we discussed?

31:14.250 --> 31:15.329
Yeah.

31:15.450 --> 31:18.710
And I gotta tell you, I've had
a lot to regret in my life...

31:19.650 --> 31:22.180
...but nothing more than the way
things went with Harry.

31:22.650 --> 31:25.349
I should have made her happy.
And I didn't.

31:26.849 --> 31:29.240
And now, well,
we both have a second chance.

31:29.849 --> 31:31.289
Her to be happy...

31:33.450 --> 31:34.960
...and me not to stand in the way.

31:35.849 --> 31:39.569
What I'm trying to say to you is
that I give you my blessing, Richard.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.650
I bless you.

31:46.650 --> 31:48.369
So long as we skip the hug thing.

31:49.049 --> 31:51.190
Hey, everyone, great news.

31:51.450 --> 31:53.450
Doyle gives his blessing.
He consents.

31:54.450 --> 31:55.890
Doyle!

31:56.849 --> 31:59.619
A toast to Doyle.

32:00.450 --> 32:01.779
To Doyle.

32:05.849 --> 32:07.849
- Doyle!
- Let's go!

32:08.250 --> 32:10.180
No hugs now.
We had an understanding.

32:10.650 --> 32:12.259
We have something for you.

32:13.650 --> 32:14.630
What?

32:14.849 --> 32:18.220
Guys, this is great, really.
But I can't reach the pretzels.

32:19.650 --> 32:23.299
I want to say how incredibly
moved I am by your sacrifice.

32:24.450 --> 32:27.079
I hope that doesn't make me
less of a man in your eyes.

32:27.450 --> 32:28.750
Sacrifice?

32:37.049 --> 32:38.910
Okay, this can't be good.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.440
Ouch!

32:45.450 --> 32:47.380
- My head's going numb.
- I should hope so.

32:47.849 --> 32:50.549
We don't want you to suffer
when we cut into your skull.

33:03.930 --> 33:05.509
That can't be right.

33:05.730 --> 33:09.380
- What?
- Something about ingesting past love.

33:12.329 --> 33:14.329
Wouldn't Doyle be your past love?

33:19.529 --> 33:20.970
Excuse me, ladies.

33:21.329 --> 33:22.200
What is it, honey?

33:22.529 --> 33:24.250
It's about the bachelor party.

33:24.930 --> 33:27.349
Richard said having
the former husband present...

33:27.930 --> 33:30.420
...was some sort of tradition.
I was just wondering--

33:30.930 --> 33:34.339
Well, they're certainly not
going to eat your ex-husband's brains.

33:39.329 --> 33:40.589
For instance.

33:42.329 --> 33:44.079
Oh, God. Where's Angel? Angel!

33:44.730 --> 33:45.779
He started a fight.

33:45.930 --> 33:48.319
He had to be ejected.
Can I get you anything?

33:48.930 --> 33:51.599
- How will you explain this to Harry?
- She'll understand.

33:52.529 --> 33:55.619
She loves and accepts our culture
like she did yours.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.500
- Nick, what's this?
- You said get a utensil.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.960
He's gonna eat the guy's brains
with a shrimp fork?

34:03.329 --> 34:06.029
Pardon me if our ancient ancestors
didn't leave behind...

34:06.930 --> 34:08.719
...any former-husband-brain-eating
forks.

34:09.329 --> 34:10.699
Get a soup spoon, you moron.

34:11.730 --> 34:14.329
Bear with us.
We're a little fuzzy on the etiquette.

34:14.730 --> 34:16.380
This hasn't been done in centuries.

34:17.130 --> 34:19.969
It's been so long since
a clan member's married a divorcée.

34:20.730 --> 34:22.449
The accursed books tell us plainly...

34:23.130 --> 34:25.900
...that ingesting a priorly married
prospective bride's...

34:26.130 --> 34:29.250
...former primary mate's brains
will ensure a happy second marriage.

34:30.329 --> 34:33.280
This way, Richie can incorporate
the love you and Harry shared...

34:33.929 --> 34:35.130
...making their union whole.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.059
It's an Ano-Movic thing. Don't ask.

34:38.130 --> 34:40.869
As much as I like your family--
They're great, honest.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.900
--I'd really prefer
if they didn't cannibalize me.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.329
Oh, no. You misunderstand.

34:48.329 --> 34:50.539
- I do?
- Yeah, it'll just be me.

34:51.329 --> 34:54.000
Why don't I give you that hug
and we can call it even?

34:54.929 --> 34:59.500
You're not trying to back out are you?
Not after you gave your blessing.

35:00.329 --> 35:01.590
Yeah, I take it back!

35:03.929 --> 35:07.760
Well, I see. Now I'm not so sure
I even want to eat your brains.

35:08.130 --> 35:09.989
Don't be petulant.
You'll eat his brains.

35:10.530 --> 35:14.250
He can't take back a blessing.
Now apologize to your friend.

35:15.929 --> 35:19.119
He's right. That was rude.
I'd be honored to eat your brains.

35:26.610 --> 35:27.690
I guess we're ready.

35:27.809 --> 35:30.619
Richard, would you care
to make the first cut?

35:39.809 --> 35:40.719
Party's over.

35:41.610 --> 35:44.489
You brought a vampire
to my brother's bachelor party?

36:21.809 --> 36:24.719
Harry says I should mix
with other demons, I'll mix.

36:47.610 --> 36:48.659
Stop it!

36:49.409 --> 36:51.369
Stop it right this instant!

36:58.409 --> 36:59.530
Hon-bun?

37:00.809 --> 37:02.460
This is for guys only.

37:03.809 --> 37:06.510
I know what you're up to,
Richard Howard Straley.

37:06.809 --> 37:08.840
The stripper wasn't my idea, pook.
I swear.

37:09.210 --> 37:12.400
Not the stripper, Richard.
There was a stripper?

37:13.409 --> 37:14.920
You really shouldn't be here.

37:15.210 --> 37:17.070
You shouldn't be eating
my friend's brains...

37:17.610 --> 37:20.489
...you horrible, ugly demon people.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.420
Cordelia. It's okay.

37:27.210 --> 37:28.510
It is so not okay.

37:30.809 --> 37:33.369
Doyle! Oh, look what they did to you!

37:36.210 --> 37:40.349
I am only going to ask you this once,
and I expect a straight answer.

37:41.010 --> 37:44.869
Were you or were you not intending
to eat my ex-husband's brains?

37:45.809 --> 37:46.889
In a way.

37:47.610 --> 37:51.300
- When were you planning on telling me?
- I thought maybe I wouldn't have to.

37:51.809 --> 37:54.230
You were gonna start
our life together with deceit?

37:54.809 --> 37:56.210
Sort of missing the point.

37:56.610 --> 37:59.730
I was trying to bless our marriage,
like in the ancient teachings.

38:00.809 --> 38:03.159
Your family follows
the ancient teachings?

38:03.809 --> 38:06.409
We don't flaunt our beliefs,
but they're dear to us.

38:06.809 --> 38:10.070
Oh, please. When's the last time you
pried yourself away from ESPN...

38:10.409 --> 38:12.619
...long enough to spill
the blood of a she-goat?

38:13.409 --> 38:15.510
Are you gonna let her talk
to him like that?

38:18.210 --> 38:21.510
You know how I feel about these
barbaric Ano-Movician customs.

38:22.409 --> 38:24.690
Racist! You're nothing but a racist!

38:25.409 --> 38:28.360
I should've told you.
But unless we complete the ritual...

38:29.010 --> 38:31.150
...my family will never consent
to the marriage.

38:31.409 --> 38:32.489
Never.

38:56.610 --> 38:57.619
Hon-bun?

39:08.610 --> 39:11.449
One word, Francis, just one,
and I'll eat your brains.

39:19.409 --> 39:20.920
You don't need her anyway.

39:21.809 --> 39:25.920
Yeah. Who wants a wife
whose knees only bend the one way?

39:43.130 --> 39:46.320
- So he spoke to her.
- Yeah.

39:46.730 --> 39:47.989
Didn't go too well, huh?

39:48.530 --> 39:50.389
I think she just needs some time.

39:50.929 --> 39:53.210
He's still really hung up on her,
isn't he?

39:55.130 --> 39:57.590
More than he knew, probably, yeah.

39:58.130 --> 40:01.179
Well, someone has to go out there
and cheer him up.

40:04.730 --> 40:07.920
Oh, please. Someone with a heartbeat.

40:13.130 --> 40:14.670
Hi, Doyle.

40:16.130 --> 40:18.269
Are you gonna become
loser-pining guy now...

40:19.130 --> 40:21.760
...because we already have
one of those around the office.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:23.929 --> 40:25.679
He can get away with it. He's tall.

40:25.730 --> 40:27.340
Look at the way clothes hang on him.

40:28.130 --> 40:30.019
I think you've cheered us up enough.

40:31.130 --> 40:33.940
You can't live in the past.
You gotta move on. Let it go.

40:34.730 --> 40:37.400
Tomorrow's another day.
Did I mention letting it go?

40:37.730 --> 40:38.809
Twice.

40:43.730 --> 40:46.960
You'll get through this.
Nice guys don't always finish last.

40:47.929 --> 40:52.429
- You think I'm a nice guy?
- I think it, I say it. It's my way.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.889
- Thanks.
- Feeling better?

40:57.530 --> 40:58.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:03.530 --> 41:05.280
- Not my fault.
- He's having a vision.

41:05.329 --> 41:06.769
At this hour?

41:20.329 --> 41:21.309
What?

41:21.530 --> 41:22.400
What did you see?
