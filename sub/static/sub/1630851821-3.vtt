WEBVTT

00:15.148 --> 00:16.449
Damn it!

00:19.619 --> 00:20.920
Are you getting a signal?

00:21.654 --> 00:23.890
No... no...

00:26.192 --> 00:28.261
So, why go on filming?

00:30.063 --> 00:31.965
If we get to sen
this footage...

00:33.266 --> 00:35.602
If we do
they might find us, Luisa.

00:35.668 --> 00:36.636
No, they won't.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.172
Can't you see we'r
in really big trouble here?

00:41.207 --> 00:44.010
Oh, no.
We went through here already!

00:44.077 --> 00:46.212
No, Luisa
This is the first time.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.483
See if you can get a signa
here. Give it a try!

00:51.251 --> 00:52.552
Give me a hand, please.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.805
This is not the fucking way
We're moving in circles!

01:19.179 --> 01:20.513
What the hell is that?

05:53.219 --> 05:54.954
It's those demons again. They...

07:12.265 --> 07:13.599
What are you doing?

07:14.667 --> 07:16.569
We've got to break out of here!

07:26.379 --> 07:28.214
Here. This is all I've got.

07:29.315 --> 07:30.683
Take Tomás with you.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.821
There was never a reward.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.624
You think saving a priest wil
get you back into God's grace?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.993
-I say f... God
-So?

07:44.864 --> 07:46.766
We were once friends.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.437
Let's go, Tomás.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.237
Breathe!

09:33.940 --> 09:35.508
Breathe, Trébol.

09:38.678 --> 09:39.912
Morphine.

10:11.978 --> 10:15.047
I don't want to di
in this jungle.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.388
I don't want to die here
Corporal...

10:24.390 --> 10:28.728
to be eaten by maggot
in this fucking jungle.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.335
And you won't.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.773
I promise.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.409
Okay.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.894
Jackson, talk to me.

11:04.463 --> 11:08.267
I have a visual on Bravo
some 220 yards out.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.302
I'm going in.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.072
We need those fuckin
medical supplies ASAP.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.208
-I'm on it, Corporal, I'm on it
-Okay.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.013
Time's running out here.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.826
There's a hu
a hundred yards away.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.529
Come on, let's go.

15:45.844 --> 15:49.081
Easy. It's okay
We got you. We got you.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.552
You didn't leave me behind.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.655
We won't ever do that
Come on, Castillo.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.859
Come on, up we go
On your feet.

16:01.660 --> 16:02.795
That's it.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.155
You can make it!

20:32.231 --> 20:34.833
Let me take a loo
at your head.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.201
Okay, okay!

20:41.206 --> 20:42.441
Take it easy.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.448
Calm down! Calm down!

20:49.748 --> 20:52.184
His lungs are collapsing
Pass me the knife!

20:52.251 --> 20:53.552
Easy! Calm down!

21:04.563 --> 21:05.697
Bite on this! Go on!

21:11.970 --> 21:14.539
Okay, hold still! Hold still!

21:22.614 --> 21:23.782
That's it! That's it!

21:50.442 --> 21:51.843
Breathe.

21:56.882 --> 21:57.983
Breathe.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.536
You're such a cry baby,
you bastard.

23:48.293 --> 23:49.528
Is that my blood?

23:56.501 --> 23:58.069
No. You're okay.

24:01.473 --> 24:02.707
Let's get out of here.

24:04.843 --> 24:05.877
Can you walk?

25:07.739 --> 25:09.140
Perhaps they did see me,

25:09.207 --> 25:11.643
but I'm sure those bastard
were with Matías.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.812
They took all the guy
from the chopper.

25:13.879 --> 25:17.949
There was a gringo in a hazma
suit, same as the other four.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.417
By the time I got there,

25:19.484 --> 25:23.221
they had taken all the medica
supplies and smashed the radio.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.157
That was no rescue mission.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.293
A rescue operation

25:28.360 --> 25:30.896
would have calle
for more than one chopper.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.400
What do you think?

25:37.335 --> 25:40.238
The term biohazard didn't eve
come up at the briefing.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.275
And they couldn't have jus
deployed the wrong chopper.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.313
We need to find a wa
of contacting our base.

25:49.447 --> 25:53.351
-The chopper radio is out
-I know the damn radio's out!

25:54.686 --> 25:55.820
So, what do I do?

25:55.887 --> 25:58.590
Go from one village to the nex
looking for a phone?

26:01.059 --> 26:03.795
If those guys followed Jackson
they can be anywhere,

26:03.862 --> 26:06.865
just waiting to see which on
of us they'll dine on first.

26:07.165 --> 26:10.402
We're in danger, Rojas
We've got to get out of here!

26:13.438 --> 26:15.073
Is there anything you can do?

26:15.373 --> 26:17.142
He's all busted up inside.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.613
You guys go try to get help
I'll stay with him.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.448
We leave no one behind.

26:23.515 --> 26:27.085
If Trébol isn't gonna make it
we might as well take him along.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.723
At least he'll stand a chanc
out there.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.225
A chance of what?

26:35.060 --> 26:37.929
His guts will spill out
It's fucking physics.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.366
Physics? Physics?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.839
Don't play professor with us
Doc.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.241
You're paid for stitching us up,

26:50.308 --> 26:52.877
and getting us to a real doctor
not for talking.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.013
You're nothin
but a nurse with a gun.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.618
In under a hundred yards
he'll be spilling his guts out.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.688
Shooting him no
would be more humane.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.933
This is the army
I'll do whatever you say.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.401
I'll follow your orders.

27:17.369 --> 27:20.405
If you think we should stay pu
and fight back

27:20.472 --> 27:22.574
until we get our asses busted
so be it.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.944
But if we have the slightes
chance of getting out of here,

27:26.011 --> 27:27.679
we need to take it now
Rojitas!

27:38.723 --> 27:40.191
We're staying with Trébol.

27:45.397 --> 27:49.000
I'd rather we get our asse
busted in close combat,

27:49.067 --> 27:50.969
standing u
for one of our bros,

27:51.036 --> 27:53.972
than runnin
through this jungle like rats.

27:55.607 --> 27:56.841
We're not rats!

28:04.916 --> 28:06.584
Doc, you stay with Trébol.

28:06.651 --> 28:09.521
Jackson, Díaz, and
will cover the house.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.032
We won't let anyone through.

28:30.041 --> 28:33.411
-Hey, are you okay
-Yes, I'm fine.

28:36.114 --> 28:38.616
-Let's take a break, one hour
-No. I'm fine.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.685
Having to carry you around

28:40.752 --> 28:43.822
will make us lose more than on
hour. We're taking a break.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.224
I'll try to fin
something to eat.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.372
That shit was rotting.

29:04.843 --> 29:07.145
It was still alive
but it was rotting away.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.584
It was rotting away.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.353
Try to get some rest.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.873
Hush up! Pipe down!

29:37.909 --> 29:40.445
Easy, easy, Trébol. Stay still!

30:01.299 --> 30:02.867
They're going to hear us.

30:26.424 --> 30:29.427
Hush up, bro
Calm down! Calm down!

32:04.222 --> 32:05.290
Castillo?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.763
Castillo! Barragán!

32:15.700 --> 32:17.602
Barragán... Castillo...

32:30.815 --> 32:31.783
Castillo...

34:11.582 --> 34:12.917
I'm gonna kill her!

34:16.487 --> 34:18.356
Get out!

34:19.123 --> 34:21.859
I swear I'll kill her
I swear!

34:25.430 --> 34:28.299
Come any closer, and I'll sli
her throat! You hear?

35:49.213 --> 35:50.314
Oh, merciful God,

35:50.381 --> 35:53.084
you who are our blessed Lord
who giveth all we have...

36:33.057 --> 36:35.793
Okay, okay. Hush up!

36:37.628 --> 36:39.764
Breathe. Come on.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.201
That's it, that's it. Breathe.

38:28.372 --> 38:31.242
Easy... easy. Calm down.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.064
Doc...

38:54.031 --> 38:58.102
I think I see something movin
out there. Hush him up.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.817
Díaz, Jackson
you see anything?

39:15.786 --> 39:16.921
Negative.

39:28.165 --> 39:29.100
Rojas?

39:30.668 --> 39:32.837
There might be somethin
20 yards away.

42:01.085 --> 42:02.052
No!

42:09.860 --> 42:10.861
Jackson...

43:55.833 --> 43:57.401
Achim?

44:01.872 --> 44:04.708
All is gone here
We've got to move on.

44:04.775 --> 44:06.610
Grandma
couldn't wake up the god.

44:06.677 --> 44:09.446
She got interrupte
by that filthy man's friends.

44:09.513 --> 44:11.515
The great mobuya
will go on sleeping.

44:11.582 --> 44:15.486
But now I know the words, an
I could have others learn them.

44:45.783 --> 44:46.817
Who's that?

45:10.340 --> 45:11.642
-Don't touch me
-Sorry.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.077
-Don't
-Calm down.

45:13.143 --> 45:14.812
-Don't touch me
-I'm not. Easy.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.947
Don't touch me
Who are you people?

45:17.981 --> 45:19.717
-What did you do to me
-Nothing.

45:19.783 --> 45:21.719
-What did you do to me
-Not a thing.

45:21.785 --> 45:23.954
What did you do to me
Who are you people?

45:24.021 --> 45:27.691
Where am I? Where am I
What did you do to me?

45:29.827 --> 45:31.128
Where am I?

45:33.097 --> 45:35.132
Calm down. Calm down.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.168
We did nothing to you
Not a thing!

45:38.235 --> 45:39.903
We found you in the swamp.

45:40.637 --> 45:41.705
Listen to me.

45:44.174 --> 45:47.144
Calm down, calm down
What is your name?

45:49.279 --> 45:50.581
What is your name?

45:52.516 --> 45:55.085
Flor. My name is Flor.

46:00.190 --> 46:02.493
Who were you with
Were you on your own?

46:04.428 --> 46:05.662
Where is Luisa?

46:06.497 --> 46:09.600
-Was there someone else
-Where is Luisa? Where is she?

46:09.666 --> 46:12.369
-Who is Luisa? Who is Luisa
-Cool down!

46:15.472 --> 46:18.108
Here. Calm down.

46:18.942 --> 46:20.677
-What did you do to me
-Nothing.

46:20.744 --> 46:22.746
What did you do
Where is my friend?

46:22.813 --> 46:26.683
We haven't touched you
Who's Luisa? Why were you here?

46:26.750 --> 46:28.152
I don't remember.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.623
Where is Luisa
Where is my friend?

46:34.124 --> 46:36.093
-No
-Where is Matías?

46:36.760 --> 46:38.028
Where is Matías?

46:38.095 --> 46:40.864
Where is Matías? He sent you
right? Where is he?

46:41.665 --> 46:43.901
Answer me, you bitch
or you die!

46:45.469 --> 46:46.904
Put the gun away, Díaz.

46:49.106 --> 46:52.843
Díaz, put the gun away
Put the fucking gun away!

46:56.613 --> 46:58.515
Díaz
put that fucking gun away!

47:02.119 --> 47:03.821
Now, motherfucker!

47:22.806 --> 47:24.775
This woman's in shock.

47:25.242 --> 47:28.645
Rojas, I'll follow yo
wherever you say.

47:28.712 --> 47:30.948
But put your fucking do
on a leash!

47:34.051 --> 47:36.620
Doc, take her insid
and tie her up.

47:38.155 --> 47:39.389
Go ahead!

47:43.060 --> 47:45.095
-No! No
-Calm down!

47:45.162 --> 47:49.733
Let go of me! Let go
Let go of me!

47:51.368 --> 47:53.103
Shut up!

47:54.571 --> 47:56.473
Stop it!

49:38.542 --> 49:41.078
-She got away
-Come on!

50:58.722 --> 51:00.323
Hit the ground!

51:01.792 --> 51:04.528
Freeze! Hit the ground
Freeze!

51:09.633 --> 51:11.368
Hit the ground!

51:13.670 --> 51:15.839
Freeze! Don't you move!

51:17.774 --> 51:19.676
Don't you move!

51:29.986 --> 51:31.221
Take cover!

51:33.723 --> 51:35.625
Díaz, take the right!
Doc, go left!

51:35.692 --> 51:37.094
Jackson, you're with me!
