WEBVTT

00:23.791 --> 00:25.491
- She is here.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.126
- Things are about to get
interesting.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.394
- You guys are so weird.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.530
- You'll see, Richie, she's
really good.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.515
- Oh, yeah?

00:32.516 --> 00:33.499
Yeah, I'm sure she
can see our futures

00:33.501 --> 00:34.600
in a little glass ball.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.268
- Well, I'm doing it.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.436
- I'm sure you are, Maddie.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.337
- It can't hurt.

00:41.742 --> 00:42.708
Hey!

00:44.779 --> 00:46.245
- How you doing, you?

00:46.247 --> 00:47.513
- I am pretty good.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.250
Where would you like to set up?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.551
- Don't matter.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.020
Long as y'all can't see me.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.558
- Well, we are
so ready for you.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.459
Come on.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.962
Hey, everyone.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.465
This is Vesna.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.467
The one I've been
telling you all about?

01:10.371 --> 01:12.738
Vesna, this is everyone.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.407
- How y'all doing?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.279
- All right.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.780
Grab your stuff, I'll
show you where to go.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.087
You can set up in here.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.090
Just let us know when you're
ready, okay?

01:32.026 --> 01:33.125
- I will.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.760
Don't you worry about that.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.232
- She's younger than I thought.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.800
- Yeah?

01:41.802 --> 01:42.968
She's kinda hot.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.671
You know, like hippie hot.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.872
I don't know,
I'm definitely doing it.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.540
- Shut up, you dork.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.441
God!

01:51.745 --> 01:53.045
- What about you, Richie?

01:55.850 --> 01:56.748
- No, I'm good.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.517
- Come on.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.186
Don't be such a party pooper.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.290
- Okay, look, I'm...

02:07.094 --> 02:10.429
I'm honestly not a big fan
of this kind of thing, okay?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.030
It's just a bunch of scammers
looking

02:12.032 --> 02:13.832
to take advantage of people.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.733
All right?

02:15.836 --> 02:16.802
- Come on, Richie.

02:18.906 --> 02:19.805
- You asked.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.842
- Okay.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.043
Hi again, everybody.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.011
- Hi.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.680
- A few ground rules.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.648
Don't ask me or the cards

02:29.650 --> 02:31.550
not about what you
don't wanna know.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.620
Or they ain't gonna tell
you none about that.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.656
About how you or anybody else
gonna die.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.326
When somebody die,
there's a split.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.428
Body, soul.

02:45.099 --> 02:46.098
I do medium.

02:46.901 --> 02:47.799
I try to talk to those

02:47.801 --> 02:49.501
who pass over to the other side.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.303
Now, I will try

02:53.174 --> 02:54.072
but no guarantee.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.577
So, who want to go first?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.012
- Me.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.513
- What you waiting for, Cher?

03:03.484 --> 03:04.383
- Oh!

03:06.187 --> 03:07.953
- Shut up, you guys.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.021
Seriously.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.558
- Why you so against this
anyway?

03:12.560 --> 03:13.525
It's just for fun.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.962
- It's stupid.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.631
- Come on, relax a little.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.566
- Whatever, Cass.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.867
It's just not my thing, okay?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.586
- You know what though?

03:23.587 --> 03:25.304
Sometimes you can be a little
too tight.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.906
Grab another beer
and relax a bit.

03:31.045 --> 03:31.910
- She just wants
everyone

03:31.912 --> 03:33.378
to have a good time, Richie.

03:42.056 --> 03:42.955
- Okay.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.824
That was seriously awesome.

03:47.027 --> 03:47.926
Who's next?

03:50.231 --> 03:51.663
- Shit, I'll go.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.598
- Baby, all you.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.380
That was so awesome,
you guys have to try that.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.482
- I told you,
she's the real deal.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.352
- Oh, whatever.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.921
- Don't be such an ass.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.589
Okay, how about you go in there

04:17.591 --> 04:19.257
and then tell me afterwards
that she didn't get you right.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.192
- Come on, Cassidy.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.728
Here's how it works, okay?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.463
They read your body language,

04:24.465 --> 04:26.231
they throw out something vague,

04:26.233 --> 04:28.300
and then they milk it, right?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.368
They follow your suggestions
based on what you respond to.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.241
Look, I honestly don't know
how you believe in this.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.609
- Okay, then do it.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.145
I don't know, let's see if
she can't show you your past.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.748
- Yeah, Richie, put your
money where your mouth is.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.317
- Couldn't you do something
normal like a sex toy party?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.819
- Look, don't even try
to get out of it, okay?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.422
Unless.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.424
Unless you're a scaredy pants.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.258
- You know what?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.092
That's it.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.594
You are chicken.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.433
- That's the dumbest thing
I've heard in my life.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.768
- If it's so dumb, then do it.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.569
- I'll go with you
and hold your hand

05:04.571 --> 05:06.772
if you're scared, honey bear.

05:06.774 --> 05:07.973
- You're crazy.

05:07.975 --> 05:08.840
You're crazy.

05:08.842 --> 05:09.941
You're double crazy.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.751
- That is some voodoo shit.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.819
All right, who's up?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.455
- Richie?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.291
Are you really
gonna chicken out?

05:27.895 --> 05:28.860
- Come on, babe.

05:31.065 --> 05:31.963
- Hey.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.267
Can we talk to family members?

05:35.269 --> 05:36.702
- We can try.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.737
- I have always
wanted to do that.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.406
- We could do a seance.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.678
Okay, y'all, hold hands.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.793
I feel the spirits.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.095
I already feel the spirits,

06:03.097 --> 06:04.696
they're waiting to talk to you.

06:05.899 --> 06:10.402
Now remember, don't let go
of your partner's hands.

06:12.406 --> 06:16.575
Spirit, oh spirit, who are
here to see family and friends,

06:17.411 --> 06:20.445
come to me, come through me.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.647
- Spirit, oh spirit,

06:22.649 --> 06:26.017
who are here to see
family and friends,

06:26.019 --> 06:28.420
come to me, come through me.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.857
- Who this?

06:35.529 --> 06:38.563
Anybody here lost
a papa or mama?

06:41.602 --> 06:44.136
- Yeah, like almost
everyone probably?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.572
- Shh!

06:47.574 --> 06:49.107
- Mama in the last year?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.810
- Yeah, me.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.348
- Her name Beth or Beth Anne?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.550
- Elizabeth.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.618
Yeah.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.220
Oh my god.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.358
Grandma, is that you?

07:07.261 --> 07:09.995
- Tina, she misses you.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.399
But she's happy.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.570
She's with Grandpa
and Jimmy now.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.109
- Tell her I love her?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.411
- She hears you.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.186
Hold up.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.721
I feel another one.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.090
Wanna come through real bad.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.967
Anyone lost a daddy?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.371
- Richie.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.473
- What?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.740
- I think that's you.

07:55.742 --> 07:56.641
- Shh.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.277
- That's you.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.111
- Shh.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.580
- It's been a while but...

08:18.165 --> 08:20.665
It'll be different this time.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.601
Richard.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.771
- Oh shit, what the
fuck was that?

08:28.408 --> 08:29.808
- Oh god.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.977
- It's bullshit.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.863
- Baby.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.732
Are you okay?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.307
- Cassidy, that shit is not
funny.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.208
All right?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.946
I told you my dad was crazy.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.918
I told you, and not like the
fun,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.187
not like the funny
kind of crazy,

09:16.189 --> 09:20.759
not like, like "The Shining"
kind of crazy, okay?

09:24.364 --> 09:25.630
He almost killed my mom.

09:27.501 --> 09:32.604
- I'm telling you, I had
nothing to do with this.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.772
I didn't do anything.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.706
- Whatever, Cass.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.746
- Baby, look.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.129
- I don't know what
happened in there

09:58.131 --> 10:00.565
but I don't think
that was your daddy.

10:00.567 --> 10:01.900
- Yeah, no shit.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.471
- Whatever it was,
it pushed through.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.008
And I don't know.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.380
Take this.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.883
- What's that?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.986
- It'll keep the bad juju away.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.354
- Seriously?

10:22.356 --> 10:25.390
- I know you can't see this for
what it is right now, but...

10:30.297 --> 10:31.196
- Okay.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.799
Honestly, I think you've done
enough

10:34.801 --> 10:38.303
and you should probably just
leave, okay?

10:39.606 --> 10:40.505
- Okay.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.742
You be careful, you.

10:44.845 --> 10:45.744
- We will.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.779
- Is he okay now?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.615
- Yeah.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.150
I mean, I think so.

11:59.152 --> 12:02.487
- What happened last night
scared the shit out of me.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.888
I can't handle
this kind of shit.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.857
I can't even watch a scary movie

12:05.859 --> 12:09.060
without hiding under the fucking
blankets, it's ridiculous.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.528
- I know.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.530
- What happened?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.699
- Honestly, I have no idea.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.535
- Was it his dad?

12:20.040 --> 12:20.939
- I don't know.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.242
- Why is he so uptight about all
this?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.146
- I'm not really
sure I should tell.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.483
I mean, it's a really personal

12:31.485 --> 12:33.251
and sensitive topic for Richie.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.019
- Cassie, this didn't
just happen to Richie,

12:35.021 --> 12:36.921
this happened to all of us.

12:36.923 --> 12:37.822
- I know.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.228
- Look, I'm not
gonna say a word.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.034
- Well, um,

12:52.839 --> 12:54.839
I guess his dad
went all Amityville

12:54.841 --> 12:58.510
and tried to kill his mom and
Richie.

12:58.512 --> 12:59.344
- No way.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.146
- Yeah.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.947
And Richie, he never
told me all the details

13:02.949 --> 13:04.115
and I don't want to push,

13:04.117 --> 13:09.187
but I guess he saved his
mom and killed his dad.

13:10.423 --> 13:14.092
I mean, his dad like
tried to kill his mom,

13:14.094 --> 13:16.327
so he shot him.

13:16.329 --> 13:21.432
And even worse, his mom,
she's in a mental institution

13:21.434 --> 13:23.535
and she has been ever since.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.770
She won't even talk to Richie.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.605
- That's fucking nuts.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.506
- Yeah.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.811
Look, Maddie, please, don't,

13:32.813 --> 13:34.379
don't say anything to anyone,
all right?

13:34.381 --> 13:35.713
Not even Cameron.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.816
At least until we
figure this out.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.552
- Look, I'm not gonna
say a word, I promise.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.921
- Thank you.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.756
- Of course.

13:52.899 --> 13:53.798
- Cassie?

13:59.272 --> 14:00.905
Honey, is that you?

14:14.588 --> 14:15.486
Baby?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.559
Are you home?

14:39.079 --> 14:39.978
Cassidy?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.002
- Richie.

16:11.004 --> 16:11.903
- Hi.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.074
- You're home early.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.676
- Yeah.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.347
- Maybe I can make some of
that stuff up to you now, huh?

16:22.349 --> 16:23.247
- Yeah, maybe.

16:25.685 --> 16:30.021
Hey, I heard some, some noises.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.058
- From the bedroom,
I hope.

16:34.060 --> 16:34.892
- Maybe.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.128
I, I don't know.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.166
- Okay.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.770
How was your day?

16:49.042 --> 16:49.941
- It was fine.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.677
I mean, it wasn't bad.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.917
Hey, I should go.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.587
I should go check on

17:04.924 --> 17:05.890
whatever that was.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.247
- Spirit.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.916
This is my home.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.787
You are not welcome here.

17:41.828 --> 17:42.927
Oh.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.229
You wanna do a little dance?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.064
Huh?

17:46.066 --> 17:50.201
You wanna do a little?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.979
- Hello?

18:01.981 --> 18:03.181
- Come over, Cher.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.649
- What's up?

18:05.485 --> 18:08.820
- There's a spirit, he been
messing with me a little bit.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.990
- Okay, I can make
time tonight so...

18:15.728 --> 18:16.894
- Okay, Cher.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.977
- She's got a gun!

18:41.454 --> 18:46.190
There's, there's a woman
with gun, she's coming.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.838
- What was that?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.173
- I don't know.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.912
- Did you leave the
bedroom door open?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.414
- I don't think so.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.823
Hey, be careful.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.527
What are you doing?

19:22.529 --> 19:23.427
- Shh.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.130
Just...

19:27.700 --> 19:28.599
Okay?

19:52.025 --> 19:54.625
I'm just trying not to
take any chances, okay?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.994
- Yeah, in case someone
throws you a baseball?

19:59.832 --> 20:03.301
- Baby, what if there
was someone in our house?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.303
- Yeah, or a draft.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.450
- Did you use
all the hot water again?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.018
- I just showered!

20:21.020 --> 20:22.620
- Yeah, for like half an hour.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.256
- So I enjoy a
hot shower, sue me.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.325
- Whatever.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.063
- Was that you?

20:32.065 --> 20:34.832
- No, that was from the
basement.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.400
- Is Dad home?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.102
- I don't think so.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.472
- So who else would it be?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.741
- I don't know.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.925
- You should go look.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.159
- No way, you're older,
you go look.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.928
- Dude, I am freezing.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.063
I just got out of the shower or
I would.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.002
- Let's go together.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.843
- I don't see anything.

21:55.915 --> 21:56.814
Let's go.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.701
- So tell me, what's so urgent?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.072
- Something happened
at work last night.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.674
- What?

22:26.879 --> 22:28.412
- I did a couple readings

22:29.349 --> 22:31.816
and I got everybody
together to do a seance.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.085
I don't know.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.287
Something pushed through.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.589
- Like a spirit?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.259
- Your guess is as good as mine.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.597
But I'll tell you one thing.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.400
Whatever it was, it was stronger

22:49.402 --> 22:51.268
than anything
I've ever felt before.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.373
Stronger than, well, you know.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.042
- Huh.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.411
- Took me over.

23:03.349 --> 23:06.450
Went through me,
went through all of us.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.021
It's like we set it free or
something.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.157
- No human spirit
can do such a thing.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.929
It must be a, a demon
or a poltergeist.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.331
Did you have your items?

23:21.734 --> 23:22.833
- I always do, Cher.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.341
- This is too layers for
most to push through.

23:42.688 --> 23:43.854
See?

23:50.263 --> 23:51.162
- No.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.201
- I hope you are right.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.404
- I hope you're wrong.

24:41.514 --> 24:42.813
- Be careful, baby.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.394
- I'm armed!

24:59.432 --> 25:00.331
I'm warning you!

25:15.414 --> 25:18.182
- Baby,
what's going on?

25:18.184 --> 25:20.651
- I don't, I don't know.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.386
The cupboards are...

25:24.457 --> 25:25.356
Can you hear me?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.257
They're...

25:40.940 --> 25:43.574
It's the fucking gypsy woman
you brought into our house.

25:43.576 --> 25:44.475
She...

25:52.151 --> 25:53.050
- Baby?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.255
It could be your dad.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.007
Baby,
what are you doing?

26:25.618 --> 26:26.684
Are you okay?

26:30.823 --> 26:31.722
- I'm, uh,

26:35.394 --> 26:36.794
I'm going to go see my mom.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.875
- Are you sure?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.981
You understand that
what happened last time

26:56.983 --> 26:58.916
will likely happen again?

26:58.918 --> 26:59.817
- I know.

26:59.819 --> 27:05.990
- Jeez, the last time you went,
you were messed up for days.

27:09.829 --> 27:10.962
I just really hope

27:10.963 --> 27:12.096
that you're putting
some thought into this.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.397
- Yeah, I know.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.202
I know, I know, babe,
but I need to go.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.206
- Baby.

27:23.442 --> 27:24.608
I don't know.

27:31.717 --> 27:32.616
- I do.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.187
I'll see you soon.

28:23.969 --> 28:24.868
- Oh no.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.671
What the fuck?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.645
- Hello?

29:08.647 --> 29:10.781
- Did you
get my texts yet?

29:10.783 --> 29:12.182
- Not yet.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.955
- You see what is
going on with me, Cher?

29:19.391 --> 29:20.290
- Oui.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.995
- What the hell do I do?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.099
- I'm not sure

29:29.101 --> 29:31.635
but let me find out.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.138
You stay safe now, you hear?

29:34.140 --> 29:35.305
- All right.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.119
- Hi.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.721
- Hey, Richie, how are you?

29:50.723 --> 29:51.855
- Doing fine.

29:51.857 --> 29:52.890
How's my mom doing?

29:54.193 --> 29:55.993
- She's still the same, sweetie.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.931
Just be gentle, okay?

30:02.368 --> 30:03.934
- Okay, thank you.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.034
Hi, Mom.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.117
It's your son.

30:57.656 --> 30:58.555
Richie.

31:01.961 --> 31:02.860
- You.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.831
You're not my son.

31:15.875 --> 31:16.807
- I think...

31:20.713 --> 31:21.712
I think he's back.

31:27.753 --> 31:32.823
I mean, not him exactly but
his energy or something.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.232
I need to know
what happened, Mom.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.907
I need to know what
really happened to him.

31:52.544 --> 31:53.443
Please.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.887
I thought maybe,

32:06.725 --> 32:08.191
maybe you'd want to help me.

32:10.796 --> 32:11.762
Like I helped you.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.235
I guess not.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.442
It's fine.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.750
I'm sorry, Mom.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.130
I'm sorry.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.371
- You are him.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.207
- You should go, Richie.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.141
- You are him.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.343
- I'm sorry.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.345
She needs her rest.
- He is you, you are him.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.612
- She needs
to settle down.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.415
- He is you,
he is you, he is you,

33:05.417 --> 33:08.885
you are him, you are him,
you are him,

33:08.887 --> 33:13.957
you are him, you are him,
you, you are.

33:17.196 --> 33:20.330
- So it looks like Abaddon or
Agramon.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.100
Maybe even.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.971
Not very good news, I'm afraid.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.339
- How would we find out?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.342
- In due time.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.678
There are always signs.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.515
- I'm gonna call the
people at the party.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.150
- No, no.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.719
There's a chance
they're not involved.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.622
- How would they know?

33:56.001 --> 33:57.200
- Hello?

33:57.202 --> 33:59.069
- Hey, Cher, it's me, Vesna.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.104
I'm gonna put you on speaker
phone.

34:01.106 --> 34:04.007
- Hey, I was just thinking of
calling you.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.375
- I kind of had a feeling.

34:06.779 --> 34:07.978
Any trouble over there?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.614
- Yeah.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.982
You could say that.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.052
We're actually at a hotel right
now.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.221
Can't really afford to
stay much longer though

34:18.223 --> 34:21.992
but I'm not going home.

34:21.994 --> 34:23.193
- I got you, Cher,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.962
but the kind of stuff we're
dealing with,

34:25.964 --> 34:27.931
I don't think it
matters where you go.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.034
I need to see you, Cher.

34:31.036 --> 34:31.935
- Okay.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.670
When?

34:34.672 --> 34:36.840
- No matter, but the sooner the
better.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.877
Oh, and I'd like to
bring my partner.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.478
He gonna like your place.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.214
- Really?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.114
Why?

34:46.085 --> 34:47.083
- He's special.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.652
More so than me, Cher.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.155
- Okay, yeah.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.761
I'd, I'd rather not go
later on though.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.331
You know, after dark?

35:01.333 --> 35:02.999
- How's about five?

35:03.001 --> 35:03.900
- All right.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.002
- Bye bye.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.906
Hope you're ready for this.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.690
- Dad?

36:43.936 --> 36:47.270
- I don't have
a good feeling on this.

36:47.272 --> 36:48.438
- Me neither.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.879
- Suppose we have no other
chance.

36:57.149 --> 36:59.583
- Still gonna follow you
no matter where you go.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.807
Rich, Cass, this is the partner
I been telling you about.

37:24.109 --> 37:25.275
Zeb.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.309
- Nice to meet you.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.481
Well, I hope you can
get rid of this thing.

37:31.483 --> 37:32.649
- I hope so too, Cher.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.586
- Let's go inside.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.224
It is not here.

38:14.226 --> 38:15.625
- What?

38:34.279 --> 38:35.178
- Zeb?

38:36.782 --> 38:40.350
- Where exactly were
you when it happened?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.794
- I was sitting right here.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.132
- And I was
here, next to Richie.

38:59.304 --> 39:01.471
- And what did it say?

39:01.473 --> 39:04.107
- She, she said something

39:04.109 --> 39:09.179
like "It'll be different
this time, Richie."

39:09.681 --> 39:11.815
But it did not sound like her.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.651
- In the voice of your father?

39:14.653 --> 39:15.752
- Not exactly, no.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.322
It didn't quite sound
like her either.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.527
- Your father, was he a bad man?

39:26.365 --> 39:27.764
- You could say that, sure.

39:29.301 --> 39:32.168
- If you don't mind,
what did he do?

39:33.004 --> 39:37.374
- Um, I really prefer
not to talk about it.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.477
It happened a long time ago,
I was 12, so.

39:41.513 --> 39:42.579
- Baby, you have to.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.220
- Okay, um.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.090
Long story short,
one week he went nuts.

39:54.092 --> 39:59.162
He got violent, he tried
to kill my mom and me.

39:59.598 --> 40:04.000
And one night when he was
strangling her,

40:04.002 --> 40:05.468
I shot him with his own gun.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.112
- What have you done?

40:21.653 --> 40:23.887
- She said that I was becoming
like him

40:26.158 --> 40:27.757
and I lost her too.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.126
She's been in a mental
institution ever since.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.195
- I'm sorry, Richie.

40:32.197 --> 40:35.999
- I am convinced it is not your
father we are dealing with.

40:37.169 --> 40:40.336
But I think I know who it is.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.672
- Who?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.378
- His name is Agramon.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.915
And he's powerful,

40:51.917 --> 40:55.452
so powerful he can fully
manifest.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.587
And he feeds on your fear.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.323
- Jesus, what are you talking
about?

41:01.359 --> 41:03.193
You mean like a demon or
something?

41:04.262 --> 41:08.765
- No, not like a demon,
but one of the very worst.

41:10.435 --> 41:13.403
Some people say Baal is
the devil's right hand.

41:15.340 --> 41:18.308
I will argue that
Agramon is his left hand

41:19.211 --> 41:21.277
and that the devil is
left-handed.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.682
- So, what?

41:25.684 --> 41:27.250
- We fight back.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.753
We stay together,
we stay strong.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.758
- I think I saw him today.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.027
- What?

41:38.029 --> 41:41.664
- In Pontiac, I was on
my way to pick up Cassie

41:43.235 --> 41:46.302
and it looked like my dad.

41:48.940 --> 41:53.443
I followed him but
he kinda disappeared.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.013
- He's already powerful
enough he can manifest,

41:57.015 --> 42:00.083
then we are in for a
battle and we should leave.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.652
- Now?

42:02.654 --> 42:04.153
- Vesna.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.054
A holy place.

42:06.591 --> 42:07.490
- Follow me.

42:12.697 --> 42:17.200
- And we, your fear is
what strengthens him.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.035
- How's this shit not gonna?

42:20.639 --> 42:24.440
I'm sorry, this stuff
not going to scare us?

42:26.578 --> 42:28.745
- Oh, it will, my babe.

42:28.747 --> 42:29.879
It will.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.381
But what he's saying is

42:32.250 --> 42:35.084
you gotta feed the monster
as little as possible.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.619
You know, starve the fuck.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.154
Hope he moves on, you know?

42:42.027 --> 42:42.926
- Exactly.

42:44.863 --> 42:48.031
- Okay, but isn't there
something,

42:49.935 --> 42:52.435
I mean something else, like
something more we could do?

42:54.272 --> 42:57.540
Besides essentially
hoping that he gets bored?

42:58.843 --> 43:01.744
- First, you should call all
your friends.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.847
He may or may not
have gone after them yet

43:04.849 --> 43:06.983
but when you resist,
he most likely will.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.520
- I'm sorry, they're
in danger too?

43:11.990 --> 43:13.022
- Oui.

43:13.024 --> 43:16.659
And wherever you go, he
will likely follow you.

43:18.830 --> 43:19.696
- So.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.835
The motel isn't safe.

43:26.605 --> 43:29.072
- I'm afraid nowhere is
all that safe right now.

43:30.475 --> 43:32.008
I will talk to some friends

43:32.010 --> 43:34.277
and see what else we can do,

43:34.278 --> 43:36.545
but for now you stay
strong, you stay together.

43:36.548 --> 43:39.048
You keep that strength
from him, okay?

43:40.018 --> 43:40.917
This is the key.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.518
- Hey, babe, how was your day?

44:19.491 --> 44:21.090
- It was pretty good
actually.

44:21.092 --> 44:21.991
Just got promoted to--

44:23.728 --> 44:24.961
What was that?

44:26.765 --> 44:28.064
- I don't know.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.700
- Is anyone here?

44:30.702 --> 44:31.601
- No.

44:52.991 --> 44:54.390
- What the hell?

44:55.460 --> 44:57.760
- Is anything missing?

44:57.762 --> 44:59.062
- I don't know.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.065
- Cam, this is nuts.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.145
Babe, I'm scared.

45:16.147 --> 45:18.514
- Everything is gonna be okay,
baby.

45:25.156 --> 45:26.089
- Hey.

45:26.091 --> 45:26.989
- Hey.

45:28.326 --> 45:31.661
So about the
party the other night.

45:31.663 --> 45:32.762
- Yeah.

45:32.764 --> 45:33.796
- And how it ended.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.699
Something came through.

45:37.469 --> 45:40.069
- Well, that explains all this
shit.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.437
- What?

45:41.439 --> 45:44.040
- It looked like somebody
broke in, nothing's missing,

45:44.042 --> 45:45.875
and it happened
while we were here.

45:45.877 --> 45:46.976
- Shit.

45:46.978 --> 45:48.578
You guys should come over.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.612
- To your place?

45:49.614 --> 45:51.280
I don't think so.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.549
- You think it matters
where you are?

45:54.786 --> 45:56.452
- I see your point.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.122
I'll be there in 15.

47:10.094 --> 47:11.928
- I know you're here.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.635
I can hear him, I can feel him.

47:23.308 --> 47:26.209
The depths of hell on you,
Carter.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.150
I'm not afraid of you.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.188
You can take my life.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.392
But not my son.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.269
- Just a dream, Sharon.

47:53.271 --> 47:54.604
Sharon, it's just a dream!

47:54.606 --> 47:56.372
- He was there, he was there!

47:56.374 --> 47:58.241
- It was just a dream,
it was just a dream.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.609
- No!

48:03.781 --> 48:05.248
- It was a dream.

48:41.519 --> 48:42.418
- Demon.

48:43.721 --> 48:45.154
You are not welcome here.

49:04.409 --> 49:06.976
I am not afraid of you, demon.

49:12.050 --> 49:14.016
You don't like that, do you?

49:22.327 --> 49:24.427
- So let me get this right.

49:24.429 --> 49:26.762
If we aren't scared of
him, he can't hurt us.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.800
- I don't think it's quite that
simple.

49:31.703 --> 49:34.337
What they said was the more
scared we are,

49:35.173 --> 49:36.439
the stronger it gets.

49:38.109 --> 49:40.309
- But, um, they did give us
this.

49:41.446 --> 49:43.813
It is the amulet for St.
Michael.

49:43.815 --> 49:46.182
It represents courage.

49:46.184 --> 49:47.917
- You guys
believe in that stuff?

49:48.953 --> 49:49.785
Like you, Richie?

49:49.787 --> 49:51.520
Come on, man, you of all people?

49:51.522 --> 49:54.190
- At this point, Cam,
what do I have to lose?

49:54.192 --> 49:56.826
- No, I'm with you on that.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.762
Do you guys have any more?

49:59.764 --> 50:00.796
- No.

50:00.798 --> 50:02.798
But we do have these.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.733
They should help.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.241
- What are you gonna do?

50:13.678 --> 50:14.577
- I don't know.

50:18.049 --> 50:21.384
- Honey, is there
anybody else coming over?

50:23.755 --> 50:24.653
- Hang on.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.826
- I got your back.

50:39.404 --> 50:40.603
- Who's there?

50:45.143 --> 50:46.709
Who's there?

50:46.711 --> 50:49.245
- Open the door,
please!

50:50.114 --> 50:51.147
It's Mom.

50:53.885 --> 50:54.784
- I'm gonna open it.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.152
- You crazy?

50:56.154 --> 50:58.387
- Richie, don't.

51:05.063 --> 51:05.961
- Mom?

51:09.834 --> 51:10.800
Get inside.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.235
Come inside.

51:16.841 --> 51:18.040
- He, he came for me.

51:18.042 --> 51:19.175
- What happened?

51:27.151 --> 51:28.050
Mom?

51:42.066 --> 51:42.965
- Richie.

51:45.136 --> 51:46.035
- What?

51:49.574 --> 51:50.873
- How did she get out?

51:57.448 --> 51:58.747
- I don't know.

52:52.103 --> 52:55.838
- I'm still trying to
figure it out, Richie.

52:56.741 --> 52:59.408
- What are you doing here?

52:59.410 --> 53:01.644
- Who to pass to?

53:01.646 --> 53:03.045
You or your mom?

53:06.450 --> 53:09.118
- What are you talking about?

53:09.120 --> 53:11.120
- You know exactly what I mean,
Richie.

53:14.358 --> 53:15.257
- No.

53:16.861 --> 53:17.826
No, I don't.

53:20.264 --> 53:21.163
And...

53:23.167 --> 53:24.800
Nothing,

53:24.802 --> 53:26.635
nothing passed, you,

53:28.873 --> 53:30.239
you did this.

53:32.343 --> 53:34.743
That's all there is to
it, there's nothing else.

53:36.147 --> 53:37.112
- I saw it.

53:38.816 --> 53:40.516
I'm pretty sure it passed to
you.

53:43.087 --> 53:43.986
Admit it.

53:45.423 --> 53:46.989
You felt the urge.

53:48.025 --> 53:52.328
If you were to spare
me, I could teach you.

53:53.998 --> 53:55.731
We'd be unstoppable.

53:58.202 --> 53:59.101
- Richie.

53:59.103 --> 54:03.205
Don't let him fool you like he
fooled me.

54:04.642 --> 54:07.209
He's trying to infect your mind.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.048
Look at him.

54:13.050 --> 54:13.983
He's done.

54:14.785 --> 54:17.319
Don't let him in.

54:18.155 --> 54:21.423
Don't let him in, you're
stronger than you think, Richie.

54:23.060 --> 54:23.892
Richie.

54:23.894 --> 54:24.793
- Listen to her?

54:25.796 --> 54:27.663
She hasn't been there for you.

54:28.699 --> 54:31.467
She's the one who's been
accusing you.

54:31.469 --> 54:32.635
- Shut up.
- Richie.

54:32.637 --> 54:35.070
- Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up,

54:35.072 --> 54:38.040
shut up, shut up, shut up, shut
up.

54:51.756 --> 54:52.655
Dead.

54:59.797 --> 55:00.863
You're dead.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.166
- So are you.

55:06.604 --> 55:07.670
- Oh my god!

56:05.496 --> 56:06.995
- Where's my mom?

56:06.997 --> 56:07.896
- What?

56:10.368 --> 56:11.834
- My mom, where'd she go?

56:11.836 --> 56:13.001
- She was right there.

56:15.172 --> 56:16.071
- Mom?

56:33.190 --> 56:34.823
Hey, I'm sorry.

56:34.825 --> 56:37.326
I should have called when she
got here.

56:38.629 --> 56:39.795
Did she come back?

56:41.098 --> 56:42.131
My mom.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.031
My mom, Sharon.

56:44.168 --> 56:45.100
Sharon Stann.

56:46.904 --> 56:49.605
I can't find her, did she come
back?

56:49.607 --> 56:51.073
- Sharon?

56:51.075 --> 56:52.174
She's in her room.

56:53.277 --> 56:54.143
- No.

56:54.145 --> 56:55.561
No, no, no, no.

56:55.562 --> 56:56.978
She must have gotten out or
something

56:56.981 --> 56:58.213
because she was here.

56:58.215 --> 57:02.851
- I gave her breakfast
and meds this morning myself.

57:02.853 --> 57:04.787
Is, is this Richie?

57:04.789 --> 57:05.687
- Yes?

57:07.758 --> 57:09.358
Are you absolutely certain?

57:09.360 --> 57:10.459
- Yes.

57:10.461 --> 57:13.262
She's been here all night,
Richie.

57:24.408 --> 57:25.307
- Um.

57:26.977 --> 57:28.177
So she's there.

57:33.818 --> 57:35.117
They said she never left.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.486
- How is that even possible?

57:38.689 --> 57:42.391
Who the hell did we let
into our house last night?

57:44.028 --> 57:45.461
- I think we both know who.

57:46.430 --> 57:49.131
- You know, this is so fucked
up!

57:49.133 --> 57:50.365
These amulets.

57:50.367 --> 57:51.533
What was all this for?

57:52.903 --> 57:54.536
- So what, this thing can
shape-shift

57:54.537 --> 57:56.170
into anything it wants at any
time?

57:58.375 --> 58:00.943
How the hell are we supposed
to know who's real or not?

58:19.263 --> 58:20.929
- Next card up all gonna be you.

58:28.372 --> 58:30.339
- What was that?

58:30.341 --> 58:31.440
- Gotta redo card.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.213
Something not right.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.563
I'm guessing the card
don't want to show today.

58:57.501 --> 58:59.101
Maybe we can do something else.

59:00.204 --> 59:03.071
- I mean, I really just
wanted the regular reading.

59:05.009 --> 59:05.908
But I guess.

59:06.677 --> 59:07.943
- It'll be on the house.

59:19.924 --> 59:20.889
- Something wrong?

59:22.192 --> 59:23.592
- Not you, Cher.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.630
Just something not right.

59:34.838 --> 59:35.904
- Oh my god.

59:36.674 --> 59:38.173
What is going on?

59:44.782 --> 59:45.614
- I guess that's all I needed to
see

59:45.616 --> 59:47.449
to know today's not the day.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:07.536
- You're all going to
die.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.579
- You're sure it's Agramon?

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.283
- All the signs points towards
it.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.219
- That's not good.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:28.624
- And it is already strong,
strong enough to manifest.

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:34.763
- So there's no other way out?

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.866
- Not that I can see.

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.303
We stay and we fight.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.805
- Well, I have something.

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:46.575
Something that might work.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.417
This.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.019
This is the demon killer.

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:01.523
- And you think this will work?

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:03.625
- I do.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.726
It's supposed to have been
blessed by two disciples

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:09.231
and they say it's what killed
Dracula.

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:24.646
- The
budget meeting very soon.

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:25.547
- Of course.

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:26.448
- Yeah.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.783
Maybe Mike and the guys can
meet...

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:33.789
- Sorry, excuse me.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:42.931
- Rich.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.545
- Can we talk for a
minute?

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:31.947
- Sure, Richie, what's up?

01:02:39.623 --> 01:02:41.223
You all right?

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.624
Look like you seen a ghost.

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.369
- I need to take the rest of
today off.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:58.073
If that's okay, I'll make
it up to you this weekend.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:01.576
- Sure.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:03.345
Is there anything I can help
with?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.817
- Trust me, Ben, you don't want
to.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.088
- I don't know what that means
but, uh,

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:16.658
I'll take your word for it.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.262
- Thank you.

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:22.631
- Yeah, no problem.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:30.372
- Hey, um, I'm here to
see Mrs. Sharon Stann.

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:32.340
- Miss Stann, how are you?

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:33.542
- All right.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.177
- Mind signing there for me?

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:36.077
- Yeah.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.383
- You know, she's had a rough
time these last couple days.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.685
So I'll go in there with you,
okay?

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.120
- Okay, yeah, thank you.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.637
Hey, Sharon.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.441
It's Cassie.

01:04:10.581 --> 01:04:14.482
Well, god, things have
gotten pretty crazy.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.222
Is there anything that you can
tell us?

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:26.628
Please, Sharon.

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:31.132
I don't want it to use
Richie's dad against us.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:37.405
People's lives are at stake
here, Sharon!

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:40.775
- Okay, she doesn't
need more stress.

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.312
Cassidy, you're gonna have
to calm down or leave, okay?

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:51.119
- You don't understand.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.657
He is after us and he's getting
stronger.

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.392
- I said calm down.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:01.596
- You listen to me.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.800
It passed from Carter to Richie.

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.737
He's here to claim him.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.873
Best get away.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.208
- No, no, no.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.710
You see, that's not an option
for me.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:18.914
I'm gonna stand by Richie
just like you should have!

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.382
- Cassidy, let's go, come on.

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:22.817
- You're all gonna die!

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:24.419
Do you hear me?

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.922
You all gonna die!

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:28.890
He is him, him is he.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.227
He is him, him is he.

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:35.463
He is him, him is he.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.400
He is him, him is he.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:43.371
- Look, I don't know what's
going on here

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:44.873
but this isn't acceptable.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:49.544
- You're right, none
of this is acceptable!

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:24.746
- I think we got a shot at
ending this.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:26.614
- Oh yeah?

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:27.515
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:33.755
- You say we have a
shot at ending it, huh?

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.559
- Yes.

01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:40.295
With this.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.297
- Oh, wow.

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:47.736
This legit?

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:50.739
- I got it from Killian, so I'd
say so.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.411
- I bet you been around, my
babe.

01:07:00.951 --> 01:07:02.517
I'm gonna give Cassidy a call.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.420
Tell her we have the good news.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.264
- Hey.

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:17.165
- Bonjour.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.168
We might have something to help
put an end

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.003
to this once and for
all.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:33.915
- Time to die.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.283
- What the fuck?

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:37.218
- Don't be scared, my ass, baby.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.154
I'm freaking out right now!

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:41.189
- Babe, we have to be strong.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:44.092
Remember, this thing, this
thing feeds off of our fear.

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.293
- I don't know if I can right
now, okay?

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:46.227
- You have to.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.096
- I'm going to kill
you.

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:50.065
- What the?

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.200
- I can't, I can't do
this, I can't do this.

01:07:55.005 --> 01:07:55.970
- Gotta walk.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:58.840
Screw this.

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:25.086
- Stop.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:28.823
What the hell is going on?

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.758
- You killed me, Richie.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:32.860
Your own father.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:36.397
- You were killing Mom.

01:10:37.367 --> 01:10:38.499
- I was angry.

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:41.469
But you know I would never kill
her.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.038
- That's bullshit.

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:48.610
If I wouldn't have shot you,
you would've killed her.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:49.777
- No, Richie.

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:52.947
I'm your father.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:55.350
And I love you.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.688
I would never hurt you or your
mother.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:04.892
We should go to her.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.763
She needs to see us together.

01:11:11.534 --> 01:11:12.567
It'll help her.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:16.504
Come on.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.312
- You're not my father.

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:25.680
- Yes, I am.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.181
- No.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.216
I know who you are.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.087
And I'm not gonna deal with you.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.024
Demon.

01:11:44.234 --> 01:11:45.133
- Richie.

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:48.569
Would you hurt a little girl?

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:23.304
- You doing all right, you?

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:24.972
- No, no, no actually.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:29.344
I just saw my dead father.

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:34.015
And then it wasn't him
and I tried to hit it

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.285
and it disappeared.

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:39.921
There was just some smoke.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.523
- It looks like we got here just
in time.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.092
- I'd say so.

01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:45.493
- So what's your idea?

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:51.032
- Not so much an idea
but now we have this.

01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:54.302
We got it from a close friend

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.303
who knows a thing or two about
demons.

01:12:56.306 --> 01:12:59.073
And he calls this the demon
killer.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.909
- And that'll work?

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:06.180
- If Killian says it does,
I will take his word for it.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:08.916
- Cool.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.387
That's, that's good.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:15.523
Because this thing, not so much.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:33.741
- My gun.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.642
It's inside.

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:35.643
- Well, what good is it there?

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:37.712
- Hello, it's in the frickin'
safe.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.213
- Well, that sucks.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.481
- Don't get mad at me.

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:42.116
You're the one who told me I
had to start using the safe

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.818
because you wanted to have
frickin' kids.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.486
- Look, I know what we said,
okay?

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.255
But right now, that's not gonna
help us.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:50.958
- Hang on.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:17.385
- My nerves are shot.

01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:20.188
- Yeah, this is some messed up
shit.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.459
- Can we please go back
to Cassie and Richie's?

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:26.727
- You know, as screwed up as
that sounds,

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:27.829
I think that's probably the
best--

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:30.598
Shh.

01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:08.369
- Only way in is through the
front door.

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:11.806
- You're sure this'll work?

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.879
- No, but it is the best we got.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:28.456
- Show yourself.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.268
I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.637
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:45.473
I, I faced you before.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.610
And I'll face you again.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.719
Your reign of terror is over.

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.259
I belong to God now.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:09.330
I belong to God.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:11.933
My soul is his.

01:16:14.337 --> 01:16:15.536
- Maybe so.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:21.409
But I'm not done with you.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:25.580
You can still feel pain.

01:16:33.323 --> 01:16:34.889
And when I'm done with you,

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:38.993
Richie's next.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:42.229
And trust me when I say this.

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.800
His soul is up for grabs.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.869
- He'll stand up to you.

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:49.770
- Maybe.

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:52.340
At first.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:17:00.581
You pushing him away all
these years has made him weak.

01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:07.855
What a failure of a mother you
are.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.893
You can't even protect your own
son.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:21.836
- He's stronger than you think.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.005
Yeah.

01:17:25.575 --> 01:17:27.074
That's why you're here.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.747
You can't get to him.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:40.154
You're weak.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.055
- Am I?

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.148
- Do we even know if he'll show
up?

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:10.451
- Oui.

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.352
Eventually.

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:22.697
- I can't just sit here
and stare at a door.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.199
Anyone else hungry?

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:29.036
- No.

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.272
- All right, well,

01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:35.443
I'm gonna go get myself
something to eat then.

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:43.751
- Hey, let us in!

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:49.356
- Shit, that's my friend.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.492
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, wait.

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:53.561
How do we even know it's them?

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.396
- Look, I got this.

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:10.578
- Is everything okay?

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:12.713
- I don't know.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:16.350
Take this and put it in your
hand.

01:19:16.352 --> 01:19:17.251
- What?

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:23.624
- Now you.

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:24.458
- Are you guys okay?

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.493
- Give me your hand.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:32.633
- Yeah.

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:35.770
Just tension overload
from all this craziness.

01:19:36.706 --> 01:19:37.605
Oh my god.

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:06.901
- Hey, who's here?

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:10.171
Tiff, who's here?

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:11.138
- What?

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.940
- I saw someone come into your
room

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.608
and seriously, do not lie to me.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.645
If you're smoking pot with
Claire again, I'm telling Mom.

01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:19.814
- What are you talking about?

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:23.284
Who's that?

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:31.625
- Dad?

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:35.930
- What, sweetie?

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:40.134
- Dad, there's
someone in the house.

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:41.035
- Dad?

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:44.605
- Hey, sweetie.

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:46.507
I think they're looking for ya.

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:50.811
Oh shit.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:05.392
- Go!

01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:27.081
- How long is this
gonna take?

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:30.317
- A couple of days, a week at
the most.

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:33.053
- Okay.

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:37.591
Well, I gotta work.

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.660
- Yeah.

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:42.229
Me too.

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:47.801
- I think we better stick
together.

01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:50.905
- Yeah, well.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:59.013
I live in the real world with
real bills,

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:01.882
so I can't lose my job.

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:05.653
- Sure.

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:10.958
- I'll be back after work.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:15.996
Maddie?

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.700
Feel free to stay as long as you
like.

01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:21.769
Cam, you can pop back over after
work.

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:25.239
Until we figure this thing out.

01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:26.140
- Baby.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:29.543
Promise me you'll be careful.

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:35.382
- Yeah.

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:43.757
- Hey, wait up.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.499
Wanna give me a lift to my car?

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.134
- Yeah, no problem.

01:23:07.917 --> 01:23:10.718
- Haven't heard anything in a
while.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.618
He's gone?

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:15.356
- Well, I'm not opening it.

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:16.357
- Did you think?

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:18.125
- I don't know.

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:19.860
I mean, it looked...

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:23.297
- I never even saw Mom.

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:29.136
- Okay, um, hang on, just.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:45.586
Okay.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.158
- Wait.

01:23:55.131 --> 01:23:56.030
Okay.

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:18.852
- Hey, don't, Tiffany.

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:19.753
Tiff.

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:21.989
Tiff, you're fine, come here.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:24.558
Okay.

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:32.266
I know.

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:34.735
But hey, we have to go, okay?

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:38.038
We have to go, okay?

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:40.941
- Okay.

01:24:57.993 --> 01:24:59.893
- Sleeping in today, huh?

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:00.861
That's a first.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:07.234
Oh my god!

01:25:09.472 --> 01:25:11.371
Oh my god, Sharon, no!

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.007
- What happened?

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.611
- Get us security.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.546
Saint Mary's south ward.

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:21.148
We got an apparent homicide.

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:23.450
No, she cold.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.686
She been dead a while.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.299
- Hey, you gonna be okay?

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:42.569
- Yeah.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:44.872
You?

01:25:52.014 --> 01:25:53.447
- I guess we'll see, right?

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:10.430
- Be safe.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:12.733
- You too.

01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:25.179
- This has never
happened before.

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:26.847
- And you were staffed all
night?

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.081
- Yes.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:31.084
And we have the footage of
them doing rounds, I just...

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:34.254
I just don't understand.

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:37.491
- I'll need a copy of this.

01:26:38.928 --> 01:26:39.826
- Sure.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:44.665
- Anything else you can think
of?

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:48.602
- No.

01:26:48.604 --> 01:26:51.872
I mean, I mean I had a strange
call

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.373
from Richie the other night.

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:56.410
But it's always strange dealing
with them,

01:26:56.412 --> 01:26:58.612
so I didn't think anything of
it.

01:26:59.615 --> 01:27:00.514
- Richie.

01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:03.450
That's her son, right?

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:04.851
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.423
- Hey, Simmons.

01:27:09.425 --> 01:27:10.490
- Yeah?

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:11.592
- Come here.

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:13.493
- What you got?

01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:14.962
- Look at this.

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.234
- What was that?

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:21.568
- I don't know.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.937
- She said she'd never
seen it do this before.

01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:27.040
- Who had access to this last
night?

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:30.644
- Security and the
night nurses, I suppose.

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:33.213
- Gonna need a list of
everyone that worked last night

01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:34.982
as soon as possible, please.

01:27:34.984 --> 01:27:36.416
- Sure.

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:37.985
I'll get it off the schedule for
you.

01:27:37.987 --> 01:27:40.954
- Visitors, deliveries,
anyone that came in and out.

01:27:42.558 --> 01:27:44.358
- And what about this Richie
thing?

01:27:45.294 --> 01:27:47.861
- He says she came over late
at night a couple nights before

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:50.030
but she was here all night.

01:27:51.734 --> 01:27:53.133
It was strange.

01:27:54.203 --> 01:27:56.470
Even his wife came and said
something.

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:59.039
I'm not sure what it was,

01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:01.908
but it upset Sharon.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:05.712
- Can you pull the
footage from that night?

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:08.548
- Sure, I can get that for
you, but I don't see why.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:10.117
Yeah, I know she was here.

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:13.153
I gave her her meds that
morning at 6:00 a.m.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:14.821
when I came in to do rounds.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:16.857
- Can we look?

01:28:18.193 --> 01:28:19.860
- Sure.

01:28:19.862 --> 01:28:21.495
Hold on a sec.

01:28:21.497 --> 01:28:22.562
Let me just.

01:28:34.143 --> 01:28:35.242
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:39.079
I don't know what's going on
here.

01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:42.783
- I'll be needing that too.

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.971
As a matter of fact,

01:28:47.972 --> 01:28:50.723
just give me the last
two weeks of footage.

01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:52.326
- I still don't understand.

01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:57.264
I mean, this, this has
never happened before.

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:02.202
I apologize.

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:09.803
- Hello?

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:12.572
- Richie?

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:14.941
- Yeah?

01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:18.979
- I'm afraid I have some bad
news.

01:30:18.981 --> 01:30:19.880
- Okay.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.883
- Your mom passed away last
night.

01:30:27.055 --> 01:30:27.988
- What, how?

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:31.658
- We don't know.

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:37.330
- Oh my god.

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:39.099
- I'm so sorry, Richie.

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:43.036
Look, I know you didn't
feel close to your mom

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:44.971
because of her condition,

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.508
but I know how she was when you
left.

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:52.746
And I know she loved you.

01:30:58.854 --> 01:30:59.753
I'm sorry.

01:31:00.923 --> 01:31:04.257
In the next few days,
you'll hear from the police.

01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:07.594
They're trying to figure
out what happened.

01:31:07.596 --> 01:31:09.596
Do you remember the other night,

01:31:09.598 --> 01:31:11.064
when you said she came over?

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:15.669
Well, the footage is all messed
up.

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:19.072
From that night and even last
night.

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:21.708
- What do you mean?

01:31:23.312 --> 01:31:24.377
- It's static.

01:31:25.214 --> 01:31:26.780
And the screen is blurred out.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.583
If I didn't know any better,

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.752
I'd say it was tampered with.

01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:37.057
- Are you saying she
might have been killed?

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.726
- No, I'm not saying that.

01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:44.264
But it's very strange, to
say the least, you know?

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.299
- Okay.

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.723
If you don't mind,

01:31:52.724 --> 01:31:54.107
I'd like to come and collect her
things?

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:57.911
- The police are taking most
everything.

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:02.048
You'll have to get it from them.

01:32:03.819 --> 01:32:05.452
- Okay.

01:32:05.454 --> 01:32:06.353
- Richie.

01:32:08.257 --> 01:32:10.624
Look, I'm so sorry for your
loss.

01:32:23.605 --> 01:32:25.305
- Hey, Dave, can we talk for a
second?

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:26.139
- Sure.

01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:27.741
Give us a moment.

01:32:27.743 --> 01:32:28.642
- Of course.

01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:43.456
- Um.

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:48.929
So my mom just passed.

01:32:48.931 --> 01:32:49.930
- Oh, man.

01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:52.599
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that,
man.

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:53.500
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:54.503 --> 01:32:56.836
So if it's not too much to ask,
I'd...

01:32:58.941 --> 01:33:00.006
I'd like a couple days off?

01:33:00.008 --> 01:33:01.141
- Of course.

01:33:02.177 --> 01:33:03.910
Family first, Richie.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:05.045
Family first.

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:07.647
- Yeah.

01:33:09.685 --> 01:33:11.217
Thank you.

01:33:11.219 --> 01:33:13.720
- Yeah, no problem, man.

01:33:40.582 --> 01:33:41.481
- I'll go.

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:12.145
- Detective Blackwell, LLPD.

01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:14.881
This is Detective Simmons.

01:34:16.385 --> 01:34:17.851
Is Richard Stann home?

01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.186
- You mean Richie?

01:34:21.757 --> 01:34:23.123
No.

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:24.157
He's at work.

01:34:26.428 --> 01:34:27.527
- You're his wife.

01:34:30.399 --> 01:34:31.965
- No.

01:34:31.967 --> 01:34:32.866
I'm a friend.

01:34:34.703 --> 01:34:35.602
- I am.

01:34:37.472 --> 01:34:41.341
- I take it you haven't talked
to Richard, Richie, today?

01:34:43.445 --> 01:34:44.711
- Why do you say that?

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:50.150
- His mother was
found dead this morning.

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:53.253
- Oh my god.

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:57.090
- I'm sorry.

01:34:59.294 --> 01:35:01.294
We don't have a lot of
details at this point,

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:04.698
but we're not ruling out foul
play.

01:35:05.801 --> 01:35:08.435
- Um, I have a feeling

01:35:08.437 --> 01:35:11.738
that this is going to
sound really crazy, but...

01:35:15.811 --> 01:35:19.512
We are having some really
strange things happening here.

01:35:19.514 --> 01:35:20.847
It's a long story.

01:35:23.018 --> 01:35:27.654
- Time is something I do have.

01:35:27.656 --> 01:35:30.323
- Okay, you know, come inside.

01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:31.458
Let's have a seat.

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:14.420

from GRAHA21.SITE

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:37.423
I know that this all sounds
insane

01:36:37.425 --> 01:36:40.026
but, you know, when you look
around here,

01:36:40.028 --> 01:36:43.596
you will find a perfectly
normal couple, okay?

01:36:43.598 --> 01:36:47.834
Blocking demons off with
salt to their house.

01:36:49.237 --> 01:36:51.671
- Yeah, I have to admit,
it sounds pretty wild.

01:36:52.908 --> 01:36:54.841
- Do you believe in God?

01:36:54.843 --> 01:36:56.576
- Yeah, sure.

01:36:56.578 --> 01:36:58.144
I mean, I believe in some God.

01:36:58.914 --> 01:37:02.182
Not sure what that matters
or what that means.

01:37:02.184 --> 01:37:03.883
- Do you believe in
spirituality?

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.519
- Sure.

01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:09.088
- So then you believe in spirits

01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:11.224
and now it's not so far-fetched,
no?

01:37:14.296 --> 01:37:18.231
- What I've found is people do
bad things,

01:37:19.467 --> 01:37:21.467
sometimes because of what they
believe

01:37:22.571 --> 01:37:25.738
and sometimes because they're
just flat out sick people.

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:28.541
But that's it.

01:37:29.644 --> 01:37:30.910
It's people.

01:37:30.912 --> 01:37:35.548
- It is people under the
influence.

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:40.019
See, there's a spiritual
world war going on out there.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:48.828
- Is anyone going to answer
that?

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.840
- That thing killed our parents.

01:38:00.842 --> 01:38:01.975
- What?

01:38:01.977 --> 01:38:03.209
- It killed them!

01:38:15.257 --> 01:38:17.423
- Baby, it's getting worse.

01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:21.561
That thing, it just killed
Natalie's mom and dad too!

01:38:25.066 --> 01:38:25.965
- Okay.

01:38:29.704 --> 01:38:31.537
I don't know what your plan is

01:38:31.539 --> 01:38:32.906
but we need to step it up.

01:38:47.455 --> 01:38:48.488
- Oui?

01:38:50.358 --> 01:38:52.392
- Do you need a plan B?

01:38:52.394 --> 01:38:55.862
- Mr. Stann, I apologize for
taking up so much of your time.

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:10.076
- Killian.

01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:22.956
- What do you have for me?

01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:25.591
- Well, I was trying
to think of what to do.

01:39:25.593 --> 01:39:30.129
And then I remembered
Padre Martinez found this

01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:31.864
at the Gate of Erebus.

01:39:31.866 --> 01:39:35.001
He was convinced that the
demon was trapped in it.

01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:39.339
It could be nothing,

01:39:39.341 --> 01:39:41.040
but it could be worth it.

01:39:42.577 --> 01:39:46.913
- Well, from everything
I have seen and heard,

01:39:46.915 --> 01:39:50.116
I believe we have opened
Agramon's gate right here.

01:39:50.118 --> 01:39:53.419
So we need every bullet
in our gun possible,

01:39:53.421 --> 01:39:56.122
if you know what I mean.

01:39:56.124 --> 01:39:57.924
- Well, I'm glad I could be of
help.

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:03.997
- Get away, get away!

01:40:06.434 --> 01:40:09.302
- You're all going to
die.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.306
- Who's there?

01:40:13.308 --> 01:40:16.175
- Richie, open the
door.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:18.244
It's Mom.

01:40:18.246 --> 01:40:19.145
- It is not her.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:31.257
- Richie.

01:40:32.027 --> 01:40:33.526
Richie.

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:34.761
Listen up.

01:40:34.763 --> 01:40:36.329
Open this door right now!

01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:40.867
- Can we, can we keep it
outside?

01:40:43.638 --> 01:40:46.305
- That is plan A, yeah.

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:47.507
- Okay, what's plan B?

01:40:53.048 --> 01:40:54.447
Let's hope plan A works.

01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:59.185
- Maybe we can
do this another way.

01:41:00.355 --> 01:41:01.854
- Listen to this.
- Yeah.

01:41:03.892 --> 01:41:08.995
- Richard John Stann
killed his father in 1999.

01:41:08.997 --> 01:41:10.530
He was 12.

01:41:10.532 --> 01:41:12.098
He shot him.

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.367
It says his father had been
acting strange

01:41:14.369 --> 01:41:16.335
and had become violent

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:20.807
and in one of his rages,
attempted to kill his wife
Sharon

01:41:20.809 --> 01:41:25.278
when Richard came to her
aid and shot his father.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:28.815
- Are you completely
sure about this, Killian?

01:41:30.385 --> 01:41:32.785
- It is the least
confrontational way.

01:41:34.155 --> 01:41:36.539
He's strong already.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.924
He's going to break through
and enter eventually.

01:41:38.927 --> 01:41:43.930
- Yeah, but this doesn't
feel safe.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.068
- At this point, my
friend, nothing is safe.

01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:55.608
- Shit.

01:41:57.745 --> 01:41:58.945
- Taking a sleeping pill.

01:41:58.947 --> 01:42:00.046
I'm gonna be done with this.

01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:01.881
You guys can handle
this shit on your own.

01:42:01.883 --> 01:42:04.083
- Maddie, are you nuts?

01:42:04.085 --> 01:42:06.786
- I'd rather be asleep
than getting ripped apart.

01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:08.621
I'm literally considering
this whole bottle.

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:11.057
- No, that's not going to
happen, okay?

01:42:11.059 --> 01:42:13.226
- Have you lost your mind?

01:42:13.228 --> 01:42:14.327
- I'm done with this.

01:42:18.399 --> 01:42:19.298
- Hello?

01:42:27.408 --> 01:42:29.041
Who's there?

01:42:29.043 --> 01:42:31.210
- Detective
Blackwood again.

01:42:31.212 --> 01:42:32.545
Can we come in?

01:42:43.224 --> 01:42:44.724
- Give me your hand.

01:42:44.726 --> 01:42:45.625
- What?

01:42:48.196 --> 01:42:50.196
- You're good.

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.359
- This is going to sound crazy,

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:24.463
but I think I have to do this.

01:43:24.465 --> 01:43:25.598
- Have to do what?

01:43:27.936 --> 01:43:32.605
- We open the seal, we let
it in with me, and I kill it.

01:43:34.576 --> 01:43:36.142
- Why don't we do what I said?

01:43:38.279 --> 01:43:40.079
I think it's safer.

01:43:40.081 --> 01:43:43.282
Besides, the demon
can't lie to us.

01:43:47.255 --> 01:43:48.854
- You wanna lose the other eye?

01:44:06.174 --> 01:44:07.907
- Cam should have
been here by now.

01:44:09.644 --> 01:44:11.210
- So much crazy things are
happening,

01:44:11.212 --> 01:44:12.745
who knows what's going on.

01:44:14.115 --> 01:44:15.348
- I hope he's okay.

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:19.218
- He hasn't answered
any of my calls.

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:22.288
- Hey, focus your energy
on here and now, okay?

01:44:23.558 --> 01:44:25.091
- Okay.

01:44:25.093 --> 01:44:26.092
It's ready.

01:44:31.966 --> 01:44:34.333
- The last time we tried
talking to the dead,

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.471
this whole damn mess started.

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:42.041
I sincerely hope you
know what you're doing.

01:44:43.845 --> 01:44:44.744
- As do I.

01:44:46.314 --> 01:44:49.148
This is the least
confrontational way to get him.

01:44:51.486 --> 01:44:52.852
It's worth a shot.

01:45:13.608 --> 01:45:14.974
- Spirit, oh spirit.

01:45:17.578 --> 01:45:18.544
Come to me.

01:45:20.715 --> 01:45:22.114
Come through me.

01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:30.122
- Who are you?

01:45:43.171 --> 01:45:44.603
- Hey.

01:45:44.605 --> 01:45:45.938
It's me.

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:46.772
I'm fine.

01:45:46.774 --> 01:45:47.973
Just help me up.

01:46:01.956 --> 01:46:03.823
- Cannot lie to me,
demon.

01:46:04.826 --> 01:46:06.459
- What the hell, I thought you,

01:46:07.462 --> 01:46:09.829
I thought you said it wasn't my
dad.

01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:11.097
- It isn't.

01:46:11.099 --> 01:46:12.665
- You said it couldn't lie.

01:46:13.935 --> 01:46:14.834
- Wait, wait.

01:46:17.338 --> 01:46:19.338
- In your room.

01:46:20.341 --> 01:46:22.208
- Okay, that's enough, come
back.

01:46:29.183 --> 01:46:30.449
- That wasn't no demon.

01:46:34.856 --> 01:46:36.122
It was Carter.

01:46:40.595 --> 01:46:41.794
Your daddy's here.

01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:49.802
- Yeah, can I take so many
pills?

01:46:49.804 --> 01:46:51.604
- No, no way.

01:46:51.606 --> 01:46:54.073
We're getting out of this
alive, do you hear me?

01:46:54.942 --> 01:46:57.209
- It's just a little
overwhelming, you know?

01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:00.780
- So what now?

01:47:03.217 --> 01:47:04.116
- Now,

01:47:06.554 --> 01:47:08.220
I guess we kill it.

01:47:17.698 --> 01:47:19.198
- Let me in, quickly.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.099
Quickly!

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:26.172
- Where have you been, man?

01:47:30.678 --> 01:47:31.877
Shit!

01:47:31.879 --> 01:47:32.711
- Stay back.

01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:34.113
Demon, fight me.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:39.518
I remember you from my place.

01:47:40.922 --> 01:47:44.723
You're not as tough as you
like to pretend you are.

01:48:02.577 --> 01:48:04.109
- Take it easy, Cher.

01:48:12.019 --> 01:48:14.520
Everything gonna be fine.
