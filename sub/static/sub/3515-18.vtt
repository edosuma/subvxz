You mean the Adalind who put
Juliette in a coma, Adalind?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.321
Yeah, that's the one.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.731
What's she done now?

13:37.240 --> 13:39.322
Well, she's had a baby.

No, my mom.

Wait a minute.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.969
Didn't your mom kill her mom?

Yes, but Adalind
does not know that.
