00:05.020 --> 00:06.854
Previously on Genius...

00:06.855 --> 00:08.356
Olga Khokhlova.

00:08.357 --> 00:09.857
Russian aristocracy.

00:09.858 --> 00:12.260
She must be looking for
the Duke or Viscount.

00:12.394 --> 00:13.895
I cannot let you in.

00:13.896 --> 00:15.229
We are not married.

00:15.230 --> 00:17.999
She certainly has
you under her spell.

00:18.033 --> 00:20.668
You're a married man,
with a reputation to protect.

00:20.669 --> 00:23.120
You spend your
days with your snob of

00:23.121 --> 00:26.744
a wife pretending you
are an aristocrat.

00:26.745 --> 00:29.443
At least I have not
abandoned my friends.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.613
I am the only Madam Picasso.

00:34.049 --> 00:35.550
Hey, Olga!

00:35.551 --> 00:37.885
Someday I'm going to
paint the perfect painting.

00:37.886 --> 00:39.420
I had no idea
you were so talented.

00:39.421 --> 00:41.723
Kahnweiler's been
asking me for new works to

00:41.724 --> 00:42.924
show, and I just...

00:42.925 --> 00:44.392
Don't have the time anymore...

00:44.393 --> 00:45.626
Go on.

00:45.627 --> 00:47.195
Play the game you played
the night we first met.

00:47.196 --> 00:48.997
Even when you missed,
you didn't flinch.

00:48.998 --> 00:51.099
She is so happy
when you are here, Pablo.

00:51.100 --> 00:54.503
Do you think Maya wants
to watch me cuddling Paloma?

00:54.603 --> 00:56.170
Maya loves Paloma.

00:56.171 --> 00:58.673
And how long do
you plan to keep me waiting?

00:58.674 --> 01:00.441
It did not occur
to me that you were interested

01:00.442 --> 01:01.609
in an old man.

01:01.610 --> 01:03.277
You don't seem old to me.

01:03.278 --> 01:04.779
Clear!

01:04.780 --> 01:06.447
I don't understand why
you let these women hang on.

01:06.448 --> 01:07.648
I should leave you.

01:07.649 --> 01:11.309
Ridiculous!
Nobody leaves Picasso!

My hand in your
hair will sow the stars of

02:22.991 --> 02:25.659
sapphire, pearl, ruby...

02:26.829 --> 02:29.797
that you never be deaf to my desire...

02:29.798 --> 02:35.236
my oasis and my gourd whence I aspire.

02:37.973 --> 02:41.008
Your writing is exquisite.

02:41.143 --> 02:45.813
It's not me. It's Baudelaire.

02:45.814 --> 02:48.015
You're absurdly romantic, Paul.

02:48.016 --> 02:52.487
And you, you don't have a
romantic bone in your body, do you, hm?

02:52.488 --> 02:55.756
To you, it's just
photography, politics and sex.

02:56.658 --> 02:58.593
Sex is just a game.

02:58.594 --> 03:00.995
Lately, it bores the hell out of me.

03:00.996 --> 03:03.030
All these great
men you've bedded,

03:03.031 --> 03:05.399
not one of them has managed
to get his claws into you?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.634
God no.

03:06.635 --> 03:08.702
I get tired of them
in a matter of weeks.

03:12.207 --> 03:15.843
You've never been in love?

03:16.044 --> 03:17.149
Paul...

03:17.150 --> 03:20.214
I can barely tolerate romantic.

03:20.215 --> 03:23.417
I absolutely despise sentimental.

03:23.418 --> 03:27.889
Dora, uh, love is the
most creative force in nature.

03:27.890 --> 03:31.091
What you need is an Amour Fou.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.861
A mad love?

03:33.862 --> 03:35.429
No thank you.

03:35.430 --> 03:38.232
It's what inspires
true artists like us.

03:38.233 --> 03:40.468
You don't have
to explain it to me.

03:40.469 --> 03:43.237
I understand the Surrealist
dogma as well as anyone.

03:43.639 --> 03:46.674
A magical love, born
of a chance encounter.

03:47.342 --> 03:51.412
'Fate.' Frankly, I think it's
a ridiculous superstition.

03:56.185 --> 03:58.786
You are a goddess, Dora.

03:58.787 --> 04:02.857
What you need is a God.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.595
Do you have someone in mind?

04:12.601 --> 04:14.669
Oh!
Gorillas are chasing us. Yeah!

04:18.373 --> 04:19.406
Pablo, stop that!

04:19.408 --> 04:21.142
What, what?

04:21.142 --> 04:23.133
You're embarrassing yourself.
Have you no sense of decorum?

04:23.145 --> 04:25.613
Oh. Andre, Paul!

04:26.281 --> 04:28.415
You've come just in time.

04:29.885 --> 04:33.087
Ah, oh, uh, Andre Breton
and, uh, Paul Éluard.

04:33.488 --> 04:36.790
My wife. Olga Khokhlova.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.327
It seems you forgot to
mention to your friends that

04:39.328 --> 04:41.028
this is a formal occasion.

04:41.029 --> 04:43.764
For God's sake, Olga,
who cares how they are dressed?

04:44.199 --> 04:45.600
If you want to entertain adults,

04:45.601 --> 04:47.768
you should learn to act like one.

04:48.570 --> 04:50.137
Let's go to my studio.

04:50.138 --> 04:52.473
It's the only place
she can't torture me.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.753
"I am not a gentleman."

05:05.754 --> 05:08.522
That is exactly why
you are our hero, Pablo.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.094
It's intuitive, automatic.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.929
Emanations from the subconscious.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.231
Charged with eroticism,

05:17.232 --> 05:20.701
born from the chance
juxtaposition of images.

05:20.702 --> 05:23.470
This painting is everything
I've been writing about.

05:23.972 --> 05:26.340
It's a masterpiece of Surrealism.

05:26.341 --> 05:29.677
Andre has just finished
a collection of essays,

05:30.178 --> 05:31.879
Surrealism and Painting.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.782
We would be honored
if you would endorse it.

05:34.783 --> 05:36.317
Maybe come to our next meeting?

05:36.318 --> 05:39.086
I don't want to be labeled.

05:40.055 --> 05:42.456
Surrealist, Cubist and Modernist.

05:42.624 --> 05:45.192
What is next? Communist?

05:45.193 --> 05:47.962
The Communists are
going to remake the world.

05:48.630 --> 05:54.316
Besides, my work
lately is nothing but anger.

05:54.469 --> 05:56.037
Bitterness.

05:56.038 --> 05:57.972
No one wants to see that, really.

05:57.973 --> 05:59.407
That's absurd.

05:59.408 --> 06:01.475
You're the most important
painter in France.

06:01.476 --> 06:04.645
I am stuck in a
golden cage with a woman who

06:04.646 --> 06:07.515
cares more about chandeliers
and Persian carpets than

06:07.516 --> 06:10.484
anything I will ever paint.

06:10.485 --> 06:13.020
I should have known better
than to ever get married.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.958
I need someone new...

06:53.762 --> 06:55.296
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

06:55.297 --> 06:56.764
Uh, yes?

06:56.765 --> 06:59.933
Um, you have
an extraordinary face.

07:00.402 --> 07:01.736
I beg your pardon?

07:01.737 --> 07:04.572
It was fate that you walked by.

07:04.573 --> 07:06.440
Oh, what do you mean?

07:06.441 --> 07:09.310
I want to paint you.

07:09.311 --> 07:13.214
Oh, I,
I don't think so, Monsieur.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.249
I am Picasso.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.651
I'm sorry, what?

07:17.652 --> 07:19.253
You have never heard of me?

07:19.254 --> 07:20.921
No.

07:20.922 --> 07:22.623
Should I have?

07:22.624 --> 07:25.125
Um...

07:28.029 --> 07:30.397
Recognize him?

07:30.432 --> 07:32.299
You're famous.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.468
In certain circles.

07:35.303 --> 07:37.972
Now would you let me paint you?

07:37.973 --> 07:40.307
Why would you want to?

07:40.976 --> 07:43.010
My sisters call me an ugly duck.

07:43.011 --> 07:45.179
Oh, that's absurd.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.081
They're jealous.

07:47.082 --> 07:50.617
Let me show you how I see you.

07:51.820 --> 07:55.122
My studio is just
two blocks from here.

07:59.194 --> 08:02.796
Only for a few
minutes, I have to get home.

08:18.747 --> 08:23.350
You, your sisters
couldn't be more wrong about you.

08:24.252 --> 08:26.620
You are magnificent.

08:27.689 --> 08:31.024
Like a Roman statue.

08:33.495 --> 08:35.429
That's a very special book.

08:35.429 --> 08:38.799
Go ahead, take a look at it.

08:45.173 --> 08:48.509
120 Days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade.

08:49.044 --> 08:51.812
Have you heard of it?

08:52.747 --> 08:55.983
Marquis de Sade destroyed
old-fashioned literature the

08:55.984 --> 08:59.753
same way I have
destroyed the rules of old

08:59.754 --> 09:02.055
masters of painting.

09:16.071 --> 09:19.907
"Bestowing heartfelt kisses
on my mouth and eyes, he said,

09:20.175 --> 09:22.743
'If I am to teach
you what to do in order

09:22.744 --> 09:26.513
to give me pleasure,

09:26.815 --> 09:30.584
'tis only fair that at
the same time I teach you

09:30.585 --> 09:34.288
what to do in order to receive it.'

09:36.391 --> 09:44.317
He then placed his hand upon my..."

09:58.046 --> 10:00.514
I don't want to make you late.

10:00.515 --> 10:04.952
Why don't you come back
and see me again tomorrow?

10:05.854 --> 10:07.755
I still live with my mother.

10:07.756 --> 10:11.158
She, she might not approve.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.429
You seem
like an intelligent girl.

10:15.497 --> 10:19.099
I am sure you can think
of something to tell her.

10:20.368 --> 10:24.137
If you want to come, be
here at 3:00 in the afternoon.

10:25.473 --> 10:28.041
Precisely.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.121
Where have you been?

10:41.122 --> 10:42.456
I'm sorry...

10:42.457 --> 10:43.724
I went shopping and then...

10:43.725 --> 10:46.426
I, um, I played tennis with Nicoline.

10:47.128 --> 10:49.730
In those clothes?

10:49.764 --> 10:52.666
Tell me the truth.

10:52.667 --> 10:53.934
I met someone...

10:53.935 --> 10:55.202
Who?

10:55.203 --> 10:56.670
An artist.

10:56.671 --> 10:58.439
He wants to do my portrait.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.141
He's probably
trying to get you into bed.

11:01.142 --> 11:03.510
For all you know, he's not
really an artist at all.

11:03.511 --> 11:06.680
Oh, I-I think
he's quite successful, actually.

11:06.681 --> 11:09.817
His name is Picasso.

11:09.818 --> 11:12.786
Picasso?

11:14.122 --> 11:16.657
By all means, let him paint you.

11:30.405 --> 11:32.506
You're late.

11:32.507 --> 11:34.541
I'm sorry, Monsieur Picasso.

11:34.542 --> 11:38.378
And you must call me Pablo.

11:39.514 --> 11:43.183
I promise
to always be on time...

11:43.184 --> 11:45.485
Pablo.

11:53.595 --> 11:57.230
Don't be shy.
You can look at it again.

12:12.747 --> 12:16.383
Read out loud.

12:23.725 --> 12:25.626
"She had very handsome eyes,

12:25.627 --> 12:29.697
exceedingly fair skin,
and one of the most splendid

12:29.698 --> 12:32.199
and plumpest..."

12:33.401 --> 12:36.570
Are you a virgin?

12:36.571 --> 12:39.573
Yes.

12:44.713 --> 12:48.048
Then I will be your first.

12:51.486 --> 12:54.788
Shh, don't laugh.

13:22.484 --> 13:25.319
It's Amour Fou...

13:25.320 --> 13:26.987
This girl, Geneviève.

13:26.988 --> 13:30.424
She's so young and vibrant and...

13:31.126 --> 13:33.827
It's different this time, Paul.

13:34.929 --> 13:38.799
All my romantic adventures
have been ruined by friction

13:38.800 --> 13:44.185
and-and suffering; Two
bodies coiled in barbed wire,

13:44.186 --> 13:47.703
you know, chafing against each
other, tearing their flesh.

13:47.704 --> 13:53.066
But with this one, it's been
all sweetness and honey.

13:54.716 --> 13:57.617
She's a hive without bees.

13:57.886 --> 13:59.831
She must be very good in bed to

13:59.844 --> 14:01.934
elicit such poetry from
the great Picasso.

14:02.157 --> 14:06.293
She makes me feel alive.

14:06.561 --> 14:08.228
And Françoise doesn't?

14:08.229 --> 14:11.698
She looks at me like I am old.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.001
Anyway, I have a favor to ask you.

14:15.570 --> 14:17.304
Of course, anything.

14:17.305 --> 14:20.107
I have to sneak all the way
to Paris when I want to see her.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.011
I need a place closer.

14:24.012 --> 14:26.746
St. Tropez would be perfect.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.416
I'll see what I can do.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.717
Yes...

14:30.718 --> 14:32.886
A flat, a house, a castle?

14:39.561 --> 14:42.329
Thanks for helping
me watch the children, Kostas.

14:42.330 --> 14:46.066
Well, maybe they
should take naps and we could

14:46.067 --> 14:47.768
have some sangria.

14:47.769 --> 14:49.369
Sangria?

14:49.370 --> 14:52.039
You've been spending too much
time with Pablo's nephews.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.441
Actually, I don't
like the way Javier makes it.

14:54.442 --> 14:56.910
No, we do it better in Greece.

14:56.911 --> 14:59.112
Didn't you have
a dissertation to finish?

14:59.113 --> 15:02.049
I could go
back to Paris tomorrow.

15:02.050 --> 15:04.551
All day long it's
mama this, mama that.

15:04.552 --> 15:06.186
You need a little adult time.

15:06.187 --> 15:08.222
Oh, I wish I could,
but when Pablo comes home...

15:08.223 --> 15:11.725
I have a third child to look after.

15:11.726 --> 15:14.761
Where is he anyway?

15:14.896 --> 15:18.532
We barely
ever see him these days.

15:18.533 --> 15:22.235
He's always dashing off
to Paris or St. Tropez.

15:24.038 --> 15:27.140
The children miss him.

15:27.141 --> 15:30.310
What about you?

15:30.311 --> 15:35.165
You're right, Kostas.
The children need their nap.

15:36.284 --> 15:39.419
And you need to get on a train.

15:48.162 --> 15:49.696
Daniel...

15:49.697 --> 15:55.645
Uh, it's very nice to see you,
I'm sorry, Pablo isn't here.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.572
Well, that's
my good fortune then.

15:58.573 --> 16:01.608
It gives me some time to see
what you've been working on.

16:02.143 --> 16:04.645
Well, I'm afraid I don't
have anything new to show you.

16:04.646 --> 16:08.415
I've been too busy with the children.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.950
That's a shame.

16:09.951 --> 16:12.185
I've been getting a marvelous
response to your paintings.

16:12.186 --> 16:13.654
You're just being kind.

16:13.655 --> 16:15.088
No, not at all.

16:15.089 --> 16:16.823
I've sold three pieces
this month and...

16:16.824 --> 16:19.159
do you know Janine Charrat?

16:19.160 --> 16:20.994
The choreographer?

16:20.995 --> 16:25.732
She's looking for a
designer for her new ballet in Paris.

16:25.733 --> 16:29.336
I told her you would be perfect.

16:29.871 --> 16:34.007
I've never designed
a set or a costume in my life.

16:35.043 --> 16:37.611
Neither had
Pablo when he did Parade.

16:38.046 --> 16:40.847
She loves your work, Françoise.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.287
God that sounds like fun.

16:47.288 --> 16:49.222
It's impossible.

16:49.223 --> 16:51.158
How can you go to
Paris for weeks on end?

16:51.159 --> 16:54.661
Who's going to take
care of the children?

16:54.996 --> 16:58.832
Well, they have a father.

16:58.833 --> 17:02.169
You know I cannot
look after them night and day.

17:05.506 --> 17:08.808
I wouldn't get any work done.

17:27.429 --> 17:30.264
Open the door
before I break it down!

17:31.166 --> 17:33.401
What in God's name do you want?

17:33.402 --> 17:34.590
You must get dressed.
We're going

17:34.602 --> 17:35.836
to be late for dinner
with the Beaumonts.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.806
No, you go without me.
I'm working.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.041
You're always working.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.709
You are never home
and when you are home,

17:41.710 --> 17:42.977
you lock yourself in here.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.145
Well, why wouldn't I?

17:44.146 --> 17:47.815
All you ever do is complain.

17:48.550 --> 17:51.085
Please, Olga, I'm working. Please.

18:00.629 --> 18:03.330
Don't you ever
get tired of painting me?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.401
Your face, in this light?

18:07.402 --> 18:09.336
How could I ever get tired of that?

18:09.337 --> 18:12.573
I'm glad
you still feel that way.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.475
Now go and get cleaned up.

18:14.476 --> 18:17.478
I have a surprise for you.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.315
Do you?

18:21.316 --> 18:24.852
I bought us
tickets to see Josephine Baker.

18:27.322 --> 18:33.491
Yeah, well
it's a, it's a popular play.

18:36.932 --> 18:42.207
We might run into someone who knows
Olga and what would I say to them?

18:43.071 --> 18:46.607
So even after all these years,

18:46.675 --> 18:49.743
this little flat will be the only
place we can ever be together?

18:53.014 --> 18:58.152
Pablo, when are you
going to divorce her?

18:58.720 --> 19:01.688
You promised me.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.673
You know I would like nothing

19:04.686 --> 19:06.572
better than to be
free from that woman.

19:08.096 --> 19:11.331
But, but divorce is very complicated.

19:14.936 --> 19:17.538
I love you...

19:17.539 --> 19:21.742
but for now we need to
keep things as they are.

19:21.910 --> 19:28.601
If Olga found out about you,
she would make life hell.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.619
It's heaven...

19:31.620 --> 19:33.554
Our own secret little Shangri-La.

19:33.555 --> 19:36.623
Yes, I thought it was
a rather romantic little flat.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.492
I'm delighted you like it.

19:38.493 --> 19:39.794
We love it.

19:39.795 --> 19:41.162
Thank you so much, Paul.

19:41.163 --> 19:42.819
I owe you one favor, my friend.
Oh.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.443
Monsieur Picasso, a-a few
questions for my readers, please.

19:45.444 --> 19:46.744
Oh, not now.

19:46.745 --> 19:48.212
Who's your pretty friend,
a new muse perhaps?

19:48.213 --> 19:51.048
Get out of here,
before I break that thing.

19:52.684 --> 19:55.753
Ah, Mademoiselle
Gilot, how may I help you?

19:56.088 --> 19:58.389
I've come to collect
Monsieur Picasso's pieces.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.658
I'm sorry,
they have not been fired yet.

20:00.659 --> 20:04.929
But they should be ready by the
time he returns from St. Tropez.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.532
He's in Paris, actually.

20:07.533 --> 20:08.933
Oh, well.

20:08.934 --> 20:11.969
The papers must be mistaken.

20:11.970 --> 20:14.539
Mistaken about what?

20:14.540 --> 20:17.809
I'm sure
it's just silly gossip...

20:17.810 --> 20:20.911
What kind of gossip?

20:20.979 --> 20:23.648
Well, if you must know...

20:23.649 --> 20:25.680
they say he has been seen there in the

20:25.693 --> 20:27.563
company of a striking young lady.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.870
Ah, what are these? Costumes?

20:46.638 --> 20:50.241
Mm.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.610
I've accepted the
position with the ballet.

20:52.611 --> 20:55.646
I'm leaving for Paris next week.

20:57.082 --> 21:00.551
But I told you it,
it was not possible.

21:05.691 --> 21:09.894
Well, if you can do
whatever you want, so can I.

21:10.929 --> 21:12.263
Do what I want?

21:12.264 --> 21:14.965
Uh-huh.

21:18.036 --> 21:20.438
What are you talking about?

21:20.439 --> 21:22.673
Your new girlfriend...

21:22.674 --> 21:25.342
in St. Tropez.

21:26.144 --> 21:29.380
How can you listen
to such ridiculous rumors?

21:29.381 --> 21:32.116
There is no girlfriend.

21:32.117 --> 21:35.186
Don't lie to me, Pablo.

21:36.221 --> 21:37.688
After everything we've been through,

21:37.689 --> 21:39.390
the one thing I've always
counted on is that we always

21:39.391 --> 21:42.493
tell each other the truth.

21:48.534 --> 21:52.303
Well, I, I am telling the truth.

21:54.706 --> 21:56.641
And if I was with another woman,

21:56.642 --> 21:58.409
it would be your own fault.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.579
When was the last time you
showed me any affection?

22:03.015 --> 22:05.650
That's hard to
do when you're never here.

22:05.651 --> 22:10.154
Oh, I see. You're punishing me.

22:10.722 --> 22:15.626
No. No, I'm rewarding myself.

22:16.528 --> 22:18.495
Oh.

22:18.697 --> 22:20.765
For all the
sacrifices I've made to your

22:20.766 --> 22:22.333
art at the expense of my own.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.835
It's my turn, Pablo.

22:24.836 --> 22:27.805
My God, you are made of ice.

22:28.106 --> 22:31.042
How else could a mother
just abandon her children?

22:31.043 --> 22:32.677
I'm not abandoning my children.

22:32.678 --> 22:35.913
I've spoken to Maya, she's
gonna come and watch them.

22:35.914 --> 22:37.415
I'm only going away for two months.

22:37.416 --> 22:39.917
They can visit me on weekends.

23:26.765 --> 23:29.500
Who is she?

23:29.501 --> 23:32.770
You've painted her
over and over again.

23:36.508 --> 23:38.943
She's nobody,
just, just a model.

23:39.277 --> 23:41.012
I won't be made a fool of.

23:41.013 --> 23:43.180
I gave up everything for you.

23:43.181 --> 23:45.482
My career, my country, my body.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.452
I won't have myself and my child
humiliated by some harlot.

23:48.787 --> 23:51.789
Humiliated?

23:51.790 --> 23:53.758
You live like a Russian princess.

23:53.759 --> 23:56.593
Get rid of her.

24:00.432 --> 24:03.434
Marie-Thérèse.

24:06.171 --> 24:09.206
What is it?

24:09.207 --> 24:11.976
I know it's complicated,

24:11.977 --> 24:13.377
but we must get married.

24:13.378 --> 24:14.879
We have discussed this.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.281
You know how difficult
that is and especially now,

24:17.282 --> 24:18.683
Olga is just...

24:18.684 --> 24:21.352
Pablo...

24:22.387 --> 24:25.189
I'm pregnant.

24:49.915 --> 24:53.484
Did you tell her it's over?

24:56.054 --> 24:59.123
I want a divorce.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.408
It was a, a wedding gift.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.011
I never liked it, she can have it.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.818
I'm told there's a second floor?

25:19.819 --> 25:21.319
Yeah, but that's my studio.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.888
Everything there belongs to me.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.424
Monsieur Picasso,
"one half of all possessions"

25:25.425 --> 25:27.893
includes any artwork that you own.

25:27.894 --> 25:31.696
Um, But I painted them.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.667
I'm afraid
the law is quite clear.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.775
The divorce is off.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.911
So you are
getting rid of the girl?

25:45.912 --> 25:46.945
No.

25:46.946 --> 25:47.756
Then what?

25:47.757 --> 25:49.340
I am not going to let you get

25:49.341 --> 25:51.049
away with half of my life's work.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.584
I see...

25:52.585 --> 25:54.586
God forbid you should lose any
of your precious paintings.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.121
They mean more to you than people do.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.090
Oh, I know you, Olga.

25:58.091 --> 26:00.692
You would only sell them
to buy shoes and fur coats.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.260
Do what you wish.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.097
But I refuse to be humiliated
when the papers discover you

26:05.098 --> 26:07.733
are having a baby with
your filthy mistress.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.068
Paulo and I are moving
to the Hotel California.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.837
At your expense...

26:13.039 --> 26:16.007
I hope you and your new
family are very happy...

26:28.755 --> 26:30.889
Thank you for
taking such good care of me

26:30.890 --> 26:33.558
and little Maya.

26:34.994 --> 26:38.029
Oh, of course,
you're my two girls.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.350
Marie-Thérèse...

26:58.351 --> 27:00.452
Marie-Thérèse...

27:00.453 --> 27:02.754
The doctor said it's okay.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.023
It's been two months.

27:05.024 --> 27:08.660
We have plenty of time
while the baby's asleep.

27:09.162 --> 27:12.497
Yes...

27:15.034 --> 27:18.636
Is, is something wrong?

27:27.046 --> 27:31.249
I haven't painted anything
since I have been living here.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.720
I need to go back to my studio.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.889
I thought
you loved the light here.

27:37.890 --> 27:43.962
Yes, yes, I,
I, yes, but it's, uh...

27:45.531 --> 27:49.501
different now.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.137
It's not me, is it, Pablo?

27:52.138 --> 27:55.340
I, I still inspire you, don't I?

27:55.341 --> 27:58.676
No, no, no,
no, you, you mean the,

28:00.079 --> 28:03.381
you mean the world to me...

28:03.883 --> 28:08.653
It's just, uh, too
many distractions here.

28:11.157 --> 28:14.259
I need to go back to my studio.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.828
I have to.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.264
Hey.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.899
Dear Maya.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.035
Papa will come see you
and Mama very soon.

28:28.341 --> 28:31.543
You are an angel, Maya.
How many stories did it take?

28:32.645 --> 28:35.880
Four, but
they're finally asleep.

28:38.951 --> 28:44.377
Well, I don't know
what I would do without you.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.693
You're a wonderful big sister.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.929
They're wonderful children.

28:50.930 --> 28:54.532
Obviously, Françoise
is a very good mother.

28:55.868 --> 28:59.237
Good mother?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.706
No, we have barely heard from her.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.042
I'm sure she's quite
busy with the ballet.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.411
Yeah, but her real
responsibilities are here.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.380
She's taking advantage
of your kindness.

29:08.381 --> 29:09.748
No, don't be silly.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.049
I'm glad to help.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.817
I want her to be able
to pursue her work,

29:12.818 --> 29:14.219
just like you do, Papa.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.455
But she can work here.
Nobody's stopping her.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.791
She doesn't have to run
off to Paris to do it.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.459
Instead of
complaining about her,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.161
you should be her champion.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.729
She's not like Mama.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.565
She's more independent and if
you do not treat her better,

29:27.566 --> 29:30.568
you are going to lose her.

29:43.783 --> 29:47.485
Kostas, what?

29:47.520 --> 29:50.989
Javier told me
you were working here.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.126
Why didn't you tell
me you were in town?

29:58.965 --> 30:02.066
I've been busy.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.668
Is it going well?

30:03.669 --> 30:06.471
It is, actually, it's, um,

30:06.472 --> 30:09.607
it's thrilling to work with
so many talented artists...

30:09.608 --> 30:13.177
Well, sounds wonderful.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.982
What are?

30:16.983 --> 30:19.884
Oh, I thought we
could have some sangria.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.953
And you know where
to find sangria in Paris?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.188
No.

30:24.724 --> 30:28.192
No, I know a place
with a Chablis I can afford.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.998
Merci.

30:32.999 --> 30:37.671
So, let me guess, you left him?

30:39.638 --> 30:42.340
No, why would you say that?

30:43.509 --> 30:46.978
Well, it's the only
way I could imagine Pablo

30:46.979 --> 30:48.857
allowing the mother of his children

30:48.870 --> 30:50.682
to run off to Paris without him.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.251
I didn't give him a choice.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.886
Good for you.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.388
I do miss the children though.

30:56.389 --> 31:01.157
I finish work and I go
home to a quiet apartment.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.995
If you're lonely,
you can always call me...

31:09.035 --> 31:14.720
Well, we all know Pablo
does whatever Pablo wants.

31:14.907 --> 31:18.376
Why can't you do the same?

31:23.082 --> 31:27.518
Heraclitus said nothing remains still,

31:27.853 --> 31:31.856
change is the essence of the universe.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.629
All day on his knees,

31:37.630 --> 31:39.897
before the rag so dirty
as it dribbles down.

31:42.468 --> 31:45.670
Love seated in the
corner of the kitchen.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.374
To amuse herself, she cuts her nails.

31:55.414 --> 31:59.083
It's uh, bold.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.554
Original, just like your paintings.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.593
You are afraid
to tell me it's dreadful.

32:09.829 --> 32:13.731
You see, I know I am an
amateur, but poetry...

32:16.102 --> 32:18.603
Is the only way I can
express myself lately.

32:18.604 --> 32:22.073
I, I haven't painted in-in months.

32:22.942 --> 32:27.497
I, nothing moves me
anymore, not the light,

32:27.498 --> 32:29.614
not Marie-Thérèse, nothing.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.317
You need something
new to inspire you.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.119
Let me guess.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.820
Another Amour Fou?

32:35.821 --> 32:37.789
No.

32:37.790 --> 32:42.732
Actually, I was thinking...

32:42.733 --> 32:45.363
another artist.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.812
Do you know Renoir?

32:46.813 --> 32:50.209
Of course, but I have always

32:50.210 --> 32:52.313
despised his pretty paintings.

32:52.369 --> 32:55.771
Ah, not the father, the son.

32:55.772 --> 32:58.607
Now, he's doing some
very interesting work.

33:02.579 --> 33:04.947
Cut!

33:04.948 --> 33:07.750
Cutting, that's a cut.

33:08.919 --> 33:10.810
Checking the gate, moving on.

33:10.811 --> 33:13.846
Let's print the
last two takes, please.

33:14.448 --> 33:16.749
So this is how
Charlie Chaplin does it?

33:17.184 --> 33:18.318
Well, Chaplin's a genius...

33:18.319 --> 33:21.014
Ah.
I can only hope.

33:21.015 --> 33:22.303
Jean, is that, uh?

33:22.304 --> 33:24.169
She's Dora Maar,
our set photographer.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.519
Ah, you should meet
her, Pablo, she's fascinating.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.920
Come, I'll introduce you.

33:27.921 --> 33:29.455
Florelle is our lead actress.

33:29.456 --> 33:31.791
Florelle, please meet Pablo Picasso.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.293
Monsieur Picasso,

33:33.294 --> 33:36.129
you're even more handsome
than your pictures.

33:36.130 --> 33:39.613
And you are as ravishing
as you are in your films.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.167
Even dressed as a laundress?

33:41.168 --> 33:44.203
Especially
dressed as a laundress.

33:44.204 --> 33:47.106
Why don't you introduce
me to your friends?

33:52.813 --> 33:54.347
That went well.

33:54.348 --> 33:57.917
He's easily
distracted, like a child.

33:59.653 --> 34:02.288
I thought you said he was a God?

34:02.289 --> 34:04.724
Ah, you'd think so
too if you got to know him.

34:04.725 --> 34:06.125
I would have to meet him first.

34:06.126 --> 34:10.163
And you will.
Just not today apparently.

34:10.164 --> 34:11.565
Honestly, I can't understand

34:11.579 --> 34:13.132
why you think we are so well-suited.

34:13.132 --> 34:15.201
Because my dear
Dora, you are the two most

34:15.202 --> 34:17.704
extraordinary people I know.

34:17.705 --> 34:20.373
This is absurd, Paul.

34:20.373 --> 34:22.308
Why don't you simply invite
us both to dinner instead of

34:22.309 --> 34:24.811
contriving a "chance encounter"?

34:24.812 --> 34:26.346
You know the rules of Amour Fou.

34:26.347 --> 34:27.880
If it's arranged by you,

34:27.880 --> 34:29.415
it's not exactly "fate" is it?

34:29.416 --> 34:32.018
Ah, I'm just trying
to give fate a little push.

34:33.420 --> 34:34.687
Well?

34:34.688 --> 34:38.224
We've tried it your way.

34:38.225 --> 34:41.159
Now, we are going to try mine.

34:56.543 --> 34:57.777
What are you having?

34:57.778 --> 35:00.413
Whatever you are.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.582
Pernod.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.584
Are you going to show
me your latest poems?

35:07.721 --> 35:10.589
I've had a new idea.

35:10.891 --> 35:14.127
No punctuation, and um...

35:14.128 --> 35:15.361
What?

35:15.362 --> 35:17.263
Reinventing painting wasn't enough?

35:17.264 --> 35:20.433
Now you've got to...

35:37.985 --> 35:39.786
You don't even flinch.

35:39.787 --> 35:43.222
That is the point.

35:44.725 --> 35:49.095
It's, uh, hypnotizing.

35:50.097 --> 35:53.433
Dora! I didn't see you there.

35:53.434 --> 35:57.069
Pablo, Dora Maar, the photographer.

35:57.070 --> 35:59.572
Yes, I've, I've heard your name.

35:59.573 --> 36:01.307
A Surrealist, yes?

36:01.308 --> 36:03.509
You should see her work.

36:03.510 --> 36:06.012
Intense, provocative...

36:06.013 --> 36:09.949
Well, if it as
daring as she is, it must be.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.284
Where did you learn that game?

36:11.285 --> 36:12.852
Game?

36:12.853 --> 36:15.121
This is quite serious.

36:15.122 --> 36:17.690
I could lose a finger.

36:17.691 --> 36:20.693
But one must
sacrifice for one's art.

36:20.694 --> 36:23.362
Very true.

36:23.363 --> 36:27.883
Perhaps you might be willing to
make a small sacrifice to my art.

36:31.438 --> 36:33.339
What do you have in mind?

36:33.340 --> 36:36.375
Come to my studio.

36:36.376 --> 36:40.780
You have a most interesting face.

36:41.215 --> 36:44.984
I want to photograph you.

36:49.690 --> 36:52.492
I will agree to that.

36:52.493 --> 36:55.628
But only if you allow
me to keep your gloves.

36:57.030 --> 37:02.168
I would like a memento of the day
that fate put you in my path.

37:32.203 --> 37:34.204
I have tried my
hand at photography but it's,

37:34.205 --> 37:35.772
it's not for me.

37:35.773 --> 37:37.107
Oh, no?

37:37.108 --> 37:40.010
No, too unpredictable.

37:40.011 --> 37:44.347
Not like painting where
the artist is in control.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.284
Not a slave to the whims of the sun.

37:47.285 --> 37:50.454
But the sun is similar to paint.

37:50.455 --> 37:52.222
How is that?

37:52.223 --> 37:53.639
At first you feel you must work

37:53.640 --> 37:56.643
within its limitations, its quirks.

37:57.895 --> 38:02.999
But with practice, you learn to
use those to your advantage.

38:03.334 --> 38:06.703
You feel what it wants from you.

38:10.041 --> 38:13.009
But paint I can touch.

38:15.146 --> 38:16.913
I can move with a brush...

38:16.914 --> 38:19.716
or my fingertips...

38:21.219 --> 38:22.753
Mm-hmm.

38:22.754 --> 38:26.256
But the sun surprises you.

38:26.257 --> 38:29.125
Plays with you.

38:29.460 --> 38:35.065
And film reveals
things that aren't uh...

38:35.867 --> 38:40.670
obvious to the naked eye.

38:44.542 --> 38:49.546
Maybe you would enjoy it a bit more...

38:50.048 --> 38:53.149
if you gave up some of your control...

39:07.699 --> 39:09.933
Françoise.

39:10.368 --> 39:12.369
I wasn't sure you'd come.

39:12.370 --> 39:14.404
Well, how
could I miss your debut?

39:14.405 --> 39:17.073
I am your greatest champion.

39:29.253 --> 39:32.422
Bravo!

39:37.495 --> 39:41.297
Bravo, bravo.

39:50.408 --> 39:52.743
How did you get back here?

39:52.744 --> 39:56.446
I, uh, slipped
the doorman five francs.

39:57.081 --> 39:59.750
Yeah, he should be more
careful because any scoundrel

39:59.751 --> 40:02.285
could just sneak in here.

40:04.155 --> 40:07.390
Your work is stunning, Françoise.

40:08.693 --> 40:12.429
These are for you.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.768
Thank you.

40:26.377 --> 40:31.803
I'm, I'm so sorry, I have to
go, Pablo is waiting for me.

40:34.685 --> 40:37.654
Well at least I
have one kiss to remember.

40:42.059 --> 40:45.628
Oh, bravo.

40:46.898 --> 40:48.465
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

40:48.466 --> 40:51.434
I waited two months
for you to finish the ballet.

40:53.137 --> 40:56.539
I don't mind a few extra minutes.

40:57.842 --> 41:01.144
But it will be wonderful
to have you home again.

41:02.580 --> 41:04.748
Yes, I'm excited
to see the children.

41:04.749 --> 41:08.785
Now you can concentrate
on being a mother again.

41:17.995 --> 41:21.331
Is that the only
reason you want me back home?

41:21.365 --> 41:23.200
No, no, of course not.

41:23.201 --> 41:25.902
I-I only meant that the
children have missed you.

41:25.903 --> 41:27.704
And so have I.

41:27.705 --> 41:31.575
So, you know, it has been
a change for all of us not

41:31.576 --> 41:34.310
having Mama to look after us.

41:36.614 --> 41:40.884
Well, change is the
essence of the universe, Pablo.

41:41.919 --> 41:44.921
Françoise, where are you going?

42:13.551 --> 42:17.287
No, keep them open.

42:17.288 --> 42:20.290
Look at me.

42:37.441 --> 42:40.610
What's wrong?

42:40.845 --> 42:44.247
Nothing's wrong.

42:44.348 --> 42:47.317
I, realized Paul was right.

42:52.356 --> 42:56.226
He was right that I
have never been in love before.

43:25.022 --> 43:27.190
Dora, I already have a studio.

43:27.191 --> 43:29.592
Not like this.

43:50.348 --> 43:53.683
This place is perfect for you.

43:55.987 --> 43:59.622
A place to start something new.

44:00.358 --> 44:06.426
To forget about Olga and dinner
jackets and stuffy cocktail parties.

44:10.835 --> 44:13.903
What do you think?

44:14.071 --> 44:17.507
The light is good.

44:20.945 --> 44:23.046
Did you know this
building is the setting for

44:23.047 --> 44:26.749
Balzac's story
Le Chef d'Oeuvre Inconnu?

44:28.886 --> 44:32.221
The one where the protagonist
Frenhofer is striving...

44:32.223 --> 44:36.826
Trying to paint
the perfect painting.

44:42.233 --> 44:45.068
You're right.

44:45.069 --> 44:48.538
It would be perfect.

44:49.707 --> 44:54.243
Dora, you know I cannot live with you.

44:54.912 --> 44:58.247
At least not right now.

45:07.925 --> 45:11.227
Pablo, I could
never live with you.

45:11.228 --> 45:14.297
You would drive me mad.

45:31.649 --> 45:35.952
You have come to your senses.

45:40.758 --> 45:43.626
Yes, I have.

45:45.830 --> 45:49.032
I knew you would.

45:49.033 --> 45:51.968
No one understands you like I do.

45:56.540 --> 46:00.143
Pablo, I'm leaving you.

46:00.144 --> 46:02.945
Don't tell me.

46:04.315 --> 46:07.250
Now you want to do an opera.

46:12.056 --> 46:15.825
I'm not joking.

46:19.163 --> 46:23.366
I can't live with you anymore.

46:24.068 --> 46:28.004
Is there someone else?

46:28.472 --> 46:31.674
Kostas.

46:33.010 --> 46:36.713
My, my nephew's friend?

46:36.714 --> 46:39.382
Is that who you choose to replace me?

46:40.251 --> 46:43.820
An he's an amateur philosopher?

46:44.221 --> 46:48.724
The last thing I
need is a replacement for you.

46:50.895 --> 46:55.582
I need to be free, to work
and live the way I want.

47:00.371 --> 47:04.907
I need to learn how to be happy.

47:05.509 --> 47:08.211
I have made some
arrangements for the children

47:08.212 --> 47:11.781
to start school in September in Paris.

47:11.782 --> 47:13.183
We'll be leaving then.

47:13.184 --> 47:17.420
We both know that
you will never do that.

47:19.423 --> 47:22.925
Without me, what will your life be?

47:27.398 --> 47:29.532
I don't know...

47:32.736 --> 47:36.405
but it will be my own.

47:36.774 --> 47:40.310
Well, then you
will be known as the

47:40.311 --> 47:44.614
foolish woman who left Picasso.

47:51.889 --> 47:54.290
Yep.

48:14.578 --> 48:17.847
She must be out of her mind.

48:17.848 --> 48:21.417
Those poor children being
kept from their father.

48:22.286 --> 48:26.972
Yeah, but I am sure
she won't go through with it.

48:29.159 --> 48:32.328
Here are the
pieces you asked for.

48:33.297 --> 48:36.732
I don't think
you've met my cousin Jacqueline.

48:39.703 --> 48:42.338
No.

48:44.475 --> 48:47.777
It's an honor, Monsieur Picasso.

48:47.778 --> 48:49.846
Jacqueline is very handy.

48:49.847 --> 48:52.215
She has been a great help to me.

48:52.216 --> 48:55.184
I'm sure she could help you, too...

48:55.185 --> 48:59.155
if you do find yourself needing
someone to cook or clean.

48:59.156 --> 49:02.158
Or anything else you may want.

49:08.565 --> 49:11.701
Paloma, Paloma.

49:16.173 --> 49:18.241
I need mine, Mom...

49:18.242 --> 49:22.278
All right, we'll
get it, we'll grab it after.
