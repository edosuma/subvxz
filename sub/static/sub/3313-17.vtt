WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:09.410
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:12.643 --> 00:14.184
- MEL.
- JOE.

00:14.185 --> 00:15.785
( door closes )

00:15.786 --> 00:17.117
AUSTIN?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.320
JOE.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.792
CAN SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING?
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN

00:22.793 --> 00:24.455
STANDING HERE FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:25.756 --> 00:26.657
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

00:26.658 --> 00:28.728
WELL, HE... THAT
IS TO SAY, AUSTIN,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.161
'CAUSE HE HAS A
NAME, STOPPED OVER.

00:31.162 --> 00:32.632
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE
MORE THAN THAT.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.634
YEAH YEAH. I'M GETTING THERE.

00:34.635 --> 00:39.539
AUSTIN HAS REEVALUATED HIS PREVIOUSLY
STATED POSITION VIS-A-VIS...

00:39.540 --> 00:40.670
OKAY, I'M NOT GETTING
ANYWHERE WITH HER,

00:40.671 --> 00:42.041
SO I'M GONNA MOVE ONTO YOU.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.345
AUSTIN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:45.346 --> 00:47.717
WELL, NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS, JOE,

00:47.718 --> 00:51.050
BUT I MADE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
TO GET MY TUBES UNTIED.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.722
I'M CLEARING THE PIPES,

00:52.723 --> 00:55.526
RELOADING THE TORPEDO.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.691
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE JUST
SAID "VASECTOMY REVERSAL"

01:01.692 --> 01:03.463
AND SAVED ME THE IMAGERY.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.665
AND I CAME BY TO SHARE
THE NEWS WITH MEL.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.267
SHE AND I ARE GONNA
GIVE IT A GO.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.668
WHAT KIND OF GO ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

01:08.669 --> 01:11.801
THE USUAL GO, YOU KNOW, LIKE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN GO.

01:11.802 --> 01:14.174
OH YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THAT KIND OF GO.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.777
I JUST RECENTLY
WENT THERE MYSELF.

SCOTT SUZUKI,

01:42.533 --> 01:45.205
AND SEVERAL ICE PACKS,

01:45.206 --> 01:48.338
THERE'LL BE NOTHING STANDING
IN THE WAY OF ME AND MEL.

01:48.339 --> 01:50.340
OH, I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING STANDING IN THE WAY.

01:50.341 --> 01:52.742
UH, JOE, YOU AND I CAN
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

01:52.743 --> 01:53.843
REALLY, 'CAUSE LAST TIME
I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU,

01:53.844 --> 01:55.515
YOU RAN FULL SPEED
TO AN AIRPORT.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.687
YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT MEMORY.

01:57.688 --> 01:58.788
THAT WAS THIS MORNING.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.151
WAS IT, NOW?

02:01.152 --> 02:02.822
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING
ON HERE THAT I'M MISSING?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.194
- NO.
- YES.

02:04.195 --> 02:07.197
UH, LAST NIGHT,
JOE AND I ENGAGED

02:07.198 --> 02:09.829
IN A VERY HEATED DISCUSSION.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.602
DISCUSSION? SERIOUSLY?

02:12.603 --> 02:14.734
A VERY HEATED
PERSONAL DISCUSSION.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.735
WHICH MEANT A LOT TO ME.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.836
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:16.837 --> 02:19.169
"GAME OF THRONES."

02:19.170 --> 02:20.870
AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S
REALLY ALL THAT GOOD A SHOW.

02:20.871 --> 02:22.672
YOU KNOW? JOE WAS
TAKING ONE POSITION,

02:22.673 --> 02:24.515
I WAS TAKING ANOTHER.

02:25.776 --> 02:29.179
THERE WERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
POSITIONS TAKEN, ACTUALLY.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.623
BOY, YOU KNOW, MY MOM AND I HAD THE
SAME BACK AND FORTH LAST NIGHT.

02:33.624 --> 02:35.326
I BET YOU DIDN'T.

02:36.587 --> 02:38.588
UM, JOE, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK

02:38.589 --> 02:40.660
LAST NIGHT OUR TALK
WAS SIGNIFICANT...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.762
WELL, WE NEVER "TALKED"
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.794
AND WHILE IT WAS VERY NICE,

02:44.795 --> 02:46.336
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON

02:46.337 --> 02:49.769
KNOWING WE WILL ALWAYS
HAVE THAT WONDERFUL TALK.

02:49.770 --> 02:54.244
WOW, YOU GUYS CLEARLY WENT A LOT
DEEPER THAN MY MOM AND I DID.

02:54.245 --> 02:56.706
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU DECIDED?

02:56.707 --> 02:58.708
YOU AND AUSTIN?

02:58.709 --> 03:00.681
UH-HUH.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.785
WELL THEN, GOOD LUCK
TO BOTH OF YOU.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.222
HE SEEMS REALLY CAUGHT
UP IN "GAME OF THRONES."

03:12.223 --> 03:14.225
DON'T GET HIM STARTED
ON "DOWNTON ABBEY."

03:17.268 --> 03:18.568
STOP HOGGING THE WINDOW.

03:18.569 --> 03:19.769
COME ON, I WANT TO SEE
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

03:19.770 --> 03:21.732
FINE. GO AHEAD.

03:23.574 --> 03:24.804
THAT'S AUSTIN.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.707
WHAT'D YOU DO?

03:30.781 --> 03:33.243
YOU'RE GETTING BACK
TOGETHER WITH AUSTIN?

03:33.244 --> 03:34.844
I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE
GETTING MARRIED,

03:34.845 --> 03:36.215
BUT WE'RE GIVING
THIS THING A SHOT.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.847
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
PROBLEM WITH AUSTIN

03:37.848 --> 03:38.988
AND HE'S GETTING THAT FIXED.

03:38.989 --> 03:41.321
UH, HOW DOES HE FIX
NOT BEING JOE?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.652
NO NO NO NO NO.

03:42.653 --> 03:44.324
WITH JOE THERE ARE
PROBLEMS ALL THE TIME.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.325
YOU SEE HOW WE GET ALONG.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.356
WE'RE A MESS.

03:46.357 --> 03:47.527
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.759
EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M GREAT.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.861
WHAT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY?

03:51.862 --> 03:53.563
THAT WAS WITH HER, OKAY?

03:53.564 --> 03:55.735
SHE'S THE ONE TO
BLAME FOR ALL THIS.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.236
YOU'RE BLAMING A BRA?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.709
A DOUBLE-H BRA.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.672
YOU'RE JUST USING AUSTIN SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR FEELINGS FOR JOE.

04:02.673 --> 04:03.713
YOU'RE AFRAID.

04:03.714 --> 04:05.875
TRUST ME, OKAY?

04:05.876 --> 04:07.947
WHAT I'M DOING IS THE
BEST THING FOR JOE.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.519
BECAUSE I WOULD
MAKE HIM MISERABLE.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.551
BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU
WERE "SO GREAT."

04:11.552 --> 04:13.022
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
LISTEN TO EVERYTHING I SAY,

04:13.023 --> 04:14.824
WE CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION.

04:14.825 --> 04:16.686
YOU'RE SELFISH AND EGOTISTICAL.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.558
HE'S EGOTISTICAL AND SELFISH.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.829
YOU WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.331
YEAH, MADE TO MAKE
EACH OTHER CRAZY.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.434
- CRAZY IN LOVE.
- STOP DOING THAT.

04:24.635 --> 04:26.035
IF YOU'RE REALLY
SERIOUS ABOUT AUSTIN,

04:26.036 --> 04:27.497
YOU OWE JOE AN EXPLANATION.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.499
( groans )

04:29.500 --> 04:30.970
WHERE'S THE OTHER LITTLE GIRL
WITH HORNS AND A PITCHFORK

04:30.971 --> 04:32.302
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THIS SHOULDER?

04:32.303 --> 04:33.843
HOW COME SHE NEVER
TELLS ME WHAT TO DO?

04:33.844 --> 04:35.845
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.349
OH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.854
JOE, YOU AND I NEED
TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.

04:44.855 --> 04:45.786
A DISCUSSION, HUH?

04:47.358 --> 04:50.790
A REAL DISCUSSION. YOU
KNOW, WITH OUR CLOTHES ON.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.692
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE AUSTIN HERE TONIGHT.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.823
NEITHER WAS I.

04:53.824 --> 04:56.025
BUT SOMETIMES FATE TAKES OVER

04:56.026 --> 04:58.027
AND PUTS YOU IN FRONT OF THE
PERSON YOU WERE MEANT TO BE WITH.

04:58.028 --> 04:59.729
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND ME IN JERSEY.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.831
NO NO NO NO. THAT WAS
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

05:01.832 --> 05:03.973
SOMETIMES FATE MAKES MISTAKES.

05:03.974 --> 05:05.806
SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK
OUT OF THEIR ASS.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.440
LOOK, MEL, DEEP DOWN UNDERNEATH

05:10.441 --> 05:11.581
WHEN YOU PEEL AWAY
ALL THE DENIAL,

05:11.582 --> 05:12.882
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

05:12.883 --> 05:15.546
WHAT I WANT IS THERE NOT TO BE
ANY AWKWARDNESS BETWEEN US.

05:16.847 --> 05:17.987
YOU GOT BACK TOGETHER
WITH YOUR EX

05:17.988 --> 05:19.649
THE DAY AFTER SLEEPING WITH ME.

05:19.650 --> 05:20.650
HOW COULD THAT BE AWKWARD?

05:20.651 --> 05:23.052
WELL, WITH TIME

05:23.053 --> 05:25.455
MAYBE EVERYTHING COULD GO BACK TO
THE WAY IT USED TO BE AROUND HERE.

05:25.456 --> 05:26.556
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
PART OF THE FAMILY.

05:26.557 --> 05:27.697
NOTHING HAS TO CHANGE.

05:27.698 --> 05:29.699
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
IN YOUR WORLD,

05:29.700 --> 05:32.502
I STAY HERE WORKING,
COOKING THE MEALS,

05:32.503 --> 05:33.833
STACKING THE LAUNDRY,
DOING THE KID DUTIES

05:33.834 --> 05:36.035
WHILE YOU AND AUSTIN
LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER

05:36.036 --> 05:38.037
UPSTAIRS IN YOUR BEDROOM?

05:38.038 --> 05:40.411
WITH HIS NEWLY LOADED TORPEDO.

05:42.473 --> 05:44.844
HOW CAN I SAY "NO" TO THAT?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.776
NO.

05:46.777 --> 05:49.519
WELL YEAH, THE UPSTAIRS STUFF MIGHT
BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, GRANTED.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.780
BUT I'D STILL COME DOWN
TO THE KITCHEN EVERY DAY

05:50.781 --> 05:52.452
AND SAY "LONGO, YOU'RE
DOING THAT WRONG,"

05:52.453 --> 05:54.384
AND YOU'D SAY "BUTT OUT, BURKE.
I'M DOING IT RIGHT."

05:54.385 --> 05:57.056
YOU KNOW, WE'D STILL
BE, YOU KNOW, US.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.788
BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AUSTIN.

05:58.789 --> 06:01.632
THAT'S NOT REALLY A
TRICYCLE I WANT TO RIDE ON.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.466
- MEL, WHAT HAPPENED IN JERSEY...
- WASN'T REAL!

06:06.467 --> 06:07.568
MAYBE NOT FOR YOU.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.770
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
MADE UP YOUR MIND,

06:10.771 --> 06:11.802
SO YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

06:12.703 --> 06:13.903
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:13.904 --> 06:15.805
I QUIT. I CAN'T
WORK HERE ANYMORE.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.807
WH... ( sighs )

06:17.808 --> 06:19.809
OKAY, DON'T GO MAKING ON OF
YOUR HOTHEADED JOE DECISIONS.

06:19.810 --> 06:21.611
OH, EXCUSE ME FOR
NOT GETTING GIDDY

06:21.612 --> 06:22.652
AFTER YOU DUMP ME.

06:22.653 --> 06:23.783
I DID NOT DUMP YOU.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.055
WE HAD ONE VERY SWEET
WONDERFUL NIGHT TOGETHER.

06:26.056 --> 06:27.587
THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO
TALK ABOUT EVER AGAIN.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.018
THAT'S A CLEAR DUMP.
ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT.

06:29.019 --> 06:31.060
I CAN SEE IT.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.662
THAT WAS A FULL-ON
DUMP, AUNT MEL.

06:32.663 --> 06:34.393
AND YES, THE WHOLE TIME.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.995
AND EVERY WORD.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.727
I MISSED THE FIRST
MINUTE OR TWO,

06:37.728 --> 06:39.169
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GOT THE GIST.

06:40.471 --> 06:41.731
TELL JOE HE CAN'T QUIT.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.473
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

06:43.474 --> 06:44.774
YEAH, WHY WOULD HE STAY?

06:44.775 --> 06:46.876
BECAUSE WE NEED HIM
FOR SO MANY THINGS.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.938
YEAH, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHAT IF ONE OF US,

06:48.939 --> 06:50.409
LET'S SAY YOU,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.582
MAKES A TERRIBLE DECISION
IN HER PERSONAL LIFE

06:52.583 --> 06:53.913
AND JOE WON'T BE
HERE TO POINT IT OUT

06:53.914 --> 06:55.715
SO OTHERS WILL HAVE TO.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.488
YOU'RE MAKING A
TERRIBLE DECISION!

06:58.489 --> 07:00.520
LENNOX, SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT
FOR YOUR AUNT, ALL RIGHT?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.852
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE HER DO
SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.153
SO THAT'S WHY I'M MOVING OUT.

07:04.154 --> 07:05.495
THAT'S WHY I'M SEPARATING
ALL THE COOKWARE

07:05.496 --> 07:07.498
BETWEEN WHAT'S YOURS
AND WHAT'S MINE.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.763
I'M DONE.

07:13.764 --> 07:16.606
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE AFFECTS ALL FOUR OF US,

07:16.607 --> 07:17.667
AND WE'RE ALL HERE RIGHT NOW,

07:17.668 --> 07:19.539
SO LET'S HAVE A FAMILY MEETING.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.810
EXCELLENT IDEA, LENNOX.

07:20.811 --> 07:22.472
JOE, JUST HEAR US OUT.

07:22.473 --> 07:24.674
COME ON, YOU OWE
US AT LEAST THAT.

07:24.675 --> 07:26.476
NOTHING'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THIS.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.818
( cellphone rings )

07:28.819 --> 07:30.821
IT'S AUSTIN. I MEAN,
IT'S AUSTIN, WHATEVER.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.753
JUST GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT, MEL.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.084
- REALLY?
- SURE.

07:35.085 --> 07:36.657
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING CAN WAIT.

07:38.128 --> 07:39.859
HEY, HONEY.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.161
NOT A DARN THING.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.462
YOU SEE?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.634
SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.666
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.997
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, LONGO.

07:47.998 --> 07:49.198
IT'S THE DUMPED GUY'S FAULT?

07:49.199 --> 07:50.800
OH, STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM.

07:50.801 --> 07:51.901
DID YOU EVER TELL
HER YOU LOVE HER?

07:51.902 --> 07:54.544
- I WAS GOING TO.
- OH, GOING TO.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.075
BIG MAN.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.607
THE OTHER GUY WAS
STANDING RIGHT THERE.

07:57.608 --> 07:58.808
YOU DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT?

07:58.809 --> 08:00.009
HEY, RYDER, YOU'RE A GUY.
JUMP IN HERE.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.150
HELP ME OUT. EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

08:01.151 --> 08:02.582
ALL RIGHT, LENNOX, LOOK.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.583
IN ALL FAIRNESS TO JOE...

08:03.584 --> 08:05.215
I WILL POST YOUR
BROWSING HISTORY.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.190
YOU KNOW WHAT? SORRY, JOE,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN ON THIS ONE.

08:12.022 --> 08:13.893
YOU AND AUNT MEL ARE
RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.894
YOU KNOW THAT.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.596
FOR TWO PEOPLE TO BE
RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER,

08:16.597 --> 08:17.867
THEY BOTH HAVE TO KNOW IT.

08:17.868 --> 08:18.729
I DON'T GET IT.

08:18.730 --> 08:19.969
AFTER ALL YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN THROUGH,

08:19.970 --> 08:21.731
HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT HER
NOW AND FEEL NOTHING?

08:21.732 --> 08:22.802
WHO SAID I FEEL NOTHING?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.273
WELL YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

08:24.274 --> 08:25.805
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE
JUST GONNA GIVE UP?

08:25.806 --> 08:28.277
HEY, I DIDN'T GIVE UP, ALL RIGHT?
SHE GAVE UP.

08:28.278 --> 08:31.611
SHE GAVE UP ON A GREAT THING.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.813
YOU KNOW I'M TALKING
ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

08:33.814 --> 08:36.587
PRETTY HEALTHY EGO FOR A
GUY WHO JUST GOT DUMPED.

08:39.189 --> 08:41.722
WOW, THE WOMEN IN THIS
HOUSE ARE SO COLD.

08:46.997 --> 08:49.528
SO YOU KNOW, WHEN I MOVE OUT THINGS ARE
GONNA BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT AROUND HERE.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.760
IT'LL BE HELL. WE'LL STARVE.

08:50.761 --> 08:53.032
IT'LL END IN CANNIBALISM.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.765
YOU'RE ALL SKIN AND BONES, MAN.
YOU'LL BE THE LAST ONE TO GO.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.567
I'M NEVER GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN, OKAY?

08:57.568 --> 08:59.008
THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING
YOU A STARTER SELECTION

08:59.009 --> 09:00.209
OF QUALITY COOKWARE.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.141
- SHOULD I GET LENNOX?
- WE KNOW THE DEAL.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.014
IN THIS HOUSE, MEN
DO THE COOKING.

09:05.015 --> 09:07.546
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOMETHING ALL GUYS SHOULD HAVE.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.750
A TOP QUALITY
NON-STICK SAUTEE PAN.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.852
THIS THING RIGHT HERE IS THE
WORKHORSE OF ANY GOOD KITCHEN.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.624
- SHOULD I BE TAKING NOTES?
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.555
I'M GONNA BE SAYING
EVERYTHING LIKE 18 TIMES.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.758
GOOD, THAT'S ABOUT
WHEN IT SINKS IN.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.630
SO LOOK, IT ALL BEGINS, OKAY?

09:20.631 --> 09:23.092
OLIVE OIL, ONIONS AND GARLIC.

09:23.093 --> 09:25.234
NOW, I AM CONVINCED IF
ANYTHING WERE TO CIVILIZATION,

09:25.235 --> 09:26.896
AS LONG AS WE HAVE OLIVE
OIL, ONIONS, AND GARLIC,

09:26.897 --> 09:29.238
WE COULD REBUILD
IN LIKE A MONTH.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.641
OH, HELLO.

09:31.642 --> 09:33.843
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

09:33.844 --> 09:34.844
I'M ON MY WAY OUT TOO.

09:34.845 --> 09:37.647
IN A MORE GENERAL
SENSE, OF COURSE.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.578
I'M NOT HERE OFFICIALLY WORKING.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.950
I'M JUST TEACHING
THE KID THE ROPES.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.311
OH, THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

09:42.312 --> 09:43.753
HEY, AUNT MEL, YOU
KNOW IT ALL STARTS

09:43.754 --> 09:45.154
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?
WITH OLIVE OIL,

09:45.155 --> 09:47.617
ONIONS, AND, UH...

09:47.618 --> 09:49.689
AND SOMETHING.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.060
IT'S A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

09:51.061 --> 09:54.624
WELL, I'M GOING TO THE SYMPHONY
TONIGHT WITH A FRIEND.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.626
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY IT'S AUSTIN.

09:56.627 --> 09:57.827
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
DIDN'T JUST SAY THAT.

09:57.828 --> 09:58.968
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE EXCUSES.

09:58.969 --> 10:00.930
SEE? THIS ISN'T WEIRD. BYE.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.171
YOU LOOK NICE.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.232
WHAT?

10:03.233 --> 10:04.904
I JUST SAID YOU LOOK NICE,

10:04.905 --> 10:06.375
THAT'S ALL.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.837
CAN'T SOMEONE GIVE SOMEONE ELSE

10:07.838 --> 10:09.038
A COMPLIMENT IN THIS HOUSE
WITHOUT THERE BEING

10:09.039 --> 10:10.911
SOME DEEP UNDERLYING MEANING AND
A BUNCH OF LAYERS UNDER IT?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.113
IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE
"YOU LOOK NICE."

10:14.114 --> 10:15.184
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.318
RIGHT. NO BIG DEAL.

10:21.391 --> 10:24.353
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:24.354 --> 10:26.727
YOU'RE CHOPPING IT WAY TOO BIG. WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO FEED A FAMILY OF BEARS?

10:28.859 --> 10:30.760
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
AND ONE MORE THING.

10:30.761 --> 10:33.032
I NEED TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO CHANGE A FUSE.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.633
YOU REMEMBER WHERE THE
FUSE BOX IS, RIGHT?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.405
COULD YOU MAYBE
REFRESH MY MEMORY?

10:36.406 --> 10:38.408
METAL PANEL? YEA BY YEA?

10:39.970 --> 10:41.040
GARLIC!

10:41.041 --> 10:43.072
HEY, THAT'S THE THIRD ONE.

10:43.073 --> 10:44.845
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, KID.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.780
PORK TENDERLOIN WITH A
LEMON MUSTARD GLAZE.

10:50.781 --> 10:52.782
YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A GLAZE AND A SAUCE?

10:52.783 --> 10:54.925
'CAUSE, UH, ( clicks
tongue ) I DO.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.127
CAN I OFFER YOU A SLICE?

10:58.128 --> 10:59.959
DID YOU EVER MAKE THIS BEFORE?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.191
- NOPE.
- THEN I'M GONNA WAIT FOR YOU TO EAT IT FIRST

11:02.192 --> 11:04.133
AND SEE IF YOU DIE.

11:04.134 --> 11:05.835
YOUR LOSS.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.437
( sighs )

11:10.440 --> 11:11.771
OH MY GOD.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.875
I THINK I JUST HAD A PORK-GASM.

11:16.847 --> 11:19.709
I AM DEFINITELY NOT
EATING IT NOW.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.781
IF YOU DON'T SPEAK UP, I'M
GONNA EAT THIS WHOLE THING.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.853
GO FOR IT. PORK OUT.

11:23.854 --> 11:24.915
( knocking on door )

11:27.317 --> 11:28.788
HEY, RYDER, LENNOX,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.791
MY TWO FAVORITE... RELATIVES
OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.423
AUSTIN... NOT SURE
WHAT TO CALL YOU.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.465
- PORK?
- SEEMS LIKE AN ODD NICKNAME,

11:36.466 --> 11:37.828
BUT OKAY.

11:38.829 --> 11:41.400
ANYWAY, BIG DINNER
LATER WITH YOUR AUNT.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.701
BIG DINNER.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.804
OH, ON THAT SUBJECT,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.035
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.907
ME HELP YOU?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.438
( nervous chuckle )

11:49.439 --> 11:52.241
OKAY.

11:52.242 --> 11:54.183
ENGAGEMENT?

11:54.184 --> 11:55.484
I WANT TONIGHT TO GO JUST RIGHT.

11:55.485 --> 11:57.246
BUT YOU JUST SHOWED
UP TWO DAYS AGO.

11:57.247 --> 11:58.818
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN TO THAT DOCTOR

11:58.819 --> 12:00.820
WHO'S GONNA FIX
YOUR PRIVATE PARTS.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.853
APPARENTLY NOT THAT PRIVATE.

12:03.854 --> 12:07.126
JUST KIND OF SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE RUSHING INTO THIS.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.258
HEY, I'VE KNOWN MEL
MY WHOLE LIFE.

12:09.259 --> 12:10.860
I'M GONNA ACT NOW
BEFORE SOME OTHER GUY

12:10.861 --> 12:13.132
FIGURES OUT HOW AMAZING SHE IS.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.463
I BOOKED THE BEST
TABLE AT EMILIO'S,

12:14.464 --> 12:15.805
AND I'M ASKING HER TONIGHT,

12:15.806 --> 12:19.038
SO WHICH ONE OF THESE DO
YOU THINK SHE'LL LIKE?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.971
- NONE OF THEM.
- WHAT?

12:21.972 --> 12:23.813
OH, COME ON, THEY'RE DIAMONDS.

12:23.814 --> 12:25.815
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SHE FEELS
ABOUT THE DIAMOND TRADE?

12:25.816 --> 12:28.017
OH, IT'S LIKE THIS BIG
POLITICAL THING WITH HER.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.819
YEAH, THOSE ARE LIKE
SHINY LITTLE LANDMINES.

12:29.820 --> 12:32.251
JUST "BOOM BOOM BOOM!"

12:32.252 --> 12:33.853
REALLY? I...

12:33.854 --> 12:34.854
I HAD NO IDEA.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.386
YOU WANT MY ADVICE?
JUST GO HOME RIGHT NOW

12:37.387 --> 12:39.528
AND RETHINK THE WHOLE THING.

12:39.529 --> 12:40.860
HURRY. RUN.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.391
OH, GOOD, AUSTIN.

12:42.392 --> 12:44.965
HEY, ARE THESE EARRINGS OKAY
FOR THE RESTAURANT TONIGHT?

12:46.036 --> 12:47.366
PERFECT. WHAT ARE
THEY, CUBIC ZIRCONIA?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.139
ARE YOU KIDDING? ICE ICE, BABY.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.441
MOMMA LOVES HER DIAMONDS.

12:52.442 --> 12:54.974
OHH. REALLY?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.205
( chuckles )

12:56.206 --> 12:59.809
FUNNY DIAMOND JOKE.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.380
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S READY
TO TAKE ME TO DINNER?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.852
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

13:02.853 --> 13:04.353
YOU KNOW, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD ME YET WHERE WE'RE GOING.

13:04.354 --> 13:05.885
IT'S A SURPRISE.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.018
OH, WELL, I LIKE SURPRISES.

13:10.961 --> 13:13.293
SURPRISE! HE'S THE WRONG GUY.

13:21.972 --> 13:23.232
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THIS?

13:23.233 --> 13:25.304
RIGHT NOW AUSTIN'S TAKING
AUNT MEL OUT TO DINNER

13:25.305 --> 13:26.305
AND HE'S GONNA PROPOSE.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.507
AND HE CAN'T MISS.
HE HAS THREE RINGS.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.239
WHO DOES THAT?

13:30.240 --> 13:31.381
THE CIRCUS.

13:37.447 --> 13:39.218
I FEEL AWFUL.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.419
WELL, YEAH.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.251
BECAUSE WE KNOW HE'S NOT
THE RIGHT GUY FOR HER.

13:42.252 --> 13:43.923
NO, MY STOMACH.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.255
I THINK IT'S THE PORK.

13:47.257 --> 13:48.397
THEN STOP EATING IT.

13:48.398 --> 13:50.130
OH, BUT IT'S SO GOOD.

13:51.401 --> 13:53.262
DUDE, IT'S PINK IN THE MIDDLE.

13:53.263 --> 13:54.263
IT'S NOT COOKED ENOUGH.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.105
YOU DIDN'T KILL THE BACTERIA,

13:56.106 --> 13:57.606
YOU JUST PISSED THEM OFF.

13:57.607 --> 13:59.108
IT REALLY HURTS.

13:59.109 --> 14:00.339
WELL, IT'S YOUR OWN DAMN FAULT.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.342
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA VOMIT,

14:03.343 --> 14:06.016
SWALLOW IT 'CAUSE AUNT
MEL LOVES THAT COUCH.

14:08.178 --> 14:09.919
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS KITCHEN?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.250
LOOK AT THIS. THERE'S OPEN
CONTAINERS EVERYWHERE.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.451
IT'S A DISASTER.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.383
THERE'S A TON OF
DISHES IN THE SINK.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.585
I MEAN... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:16.586 --> 14:19.358
THE KID USED PORK FOR A
BEEF TENDERLOIN RECIPE?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.991
WHY DO I LET MYSELF
CARE SO MUCH?

14:21.992 --> 14:23.262
OKAY, FORGET THAT.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.934
RIGHT NOW, AUSTIN'S
TAKING MEL TO DINNER,

14:24.935 --> 14:26.436
AND HE'S GOING TO
PROPOSE TO HER.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.138
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

14:29.139 --> 14:31.270
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M
NOT GONNA DO ABOUT IT.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.143
I'M NOT GONNA CLEAN THIS
KITCHEN UP, ALL RIGHT?

14:34.144 --> 14:35.945
YOUR BROTHER'S GONNA GET
IN HERE AND CLEAN IT UP.

14:35.946 --> 14:38.107
HE'S GOT TO LEARN HOW TO
WASH A COUPLE OF POTS!

14:38.108 --> 14:39.578
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.350
YOU CAN'T JUST LET
AUSTIN DO THIS.

14:41.351 --> 14:42.511
THERE'S NOTHING I
CAN DO, ALL RIGHT?

14:42.512 --> 14:43.582
SHE'S ALREADY MADE UP HER MIND.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.984
I HAVE MY PRIDE.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.385
OH, GET OVER YOURSELF.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.017
DO YOU REALLY WANT
HER TO MARRY AUSTIN?

14:48.018 --> 14:49.218
NO, OF COURSE I DON'T. BUT...

14:49.219 --> 14:50.259
NO "BUTS"!

14:50.260 --> 14:52.061
GET DOWN THERE AND
TELL HER YOU LOVE HER,

14:52.062 --> 14:53.522
OTHERWISE AUNT MEL'S GONNA
WIND UP WITH THE WRONG GUY,

14:53.523 --> 14:55.594
AND WHEN YOU DIE, THEY'LL
WRITE ON YOUR GRAVESTONE:

14:55.595 --> 14:57.066
"HERE LIES JOE.

14:57.067 --> 15:01.130
HE DIED SAD AND ALONE,
BUT HE HAD HIS PRIDE.

15:01.131 --> 15:04.174
SO THERE'S THAT."

15:06.276 --> 15:08.037
OKAY. OKAY.

15:08.038 --> 15:09.338
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA DO IT.

15:09.339 --> 15:10.339
I'M GONNA DO IT.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.680
- WHERE DID HE TAKE HER?
- EMILIO'S.

15:11.681 --> 15:13.142
EMI... ( scoffs )

15:13.143 --> 15:14.283
SOUTHERN ITALIAN?

15:14.284 --> 15:16.386
THE GUY'S GOT NO TASTE.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.249
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA FOLLOW
ME DOWN TO THE RESTAURANT?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.490
NO, I'M JUST MAKING SURE
YOU DON'T CHICKEN OUT.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.052
HEY, I DO NOT CHICKEN OUT.

15:23.053 --> 15:24.653
GOOD, ANGER. USE THAT.

15:24.654 --> 15:27.596
( groans )

15:27.597 --> 15:28.597
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?

15:28.598 --> 15:29.959
NOTHING. BAD PORK.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.260
HE'LL PUKE. HE'LL FEEL BETTER.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.132
RYDER'S LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.603
NO, I DON'T FEEL SICK REALLY.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.505
IT JUST HURTS.

15:36.506 --> 15:39.138
- WHERE DOES IT HURT?
- IN HIS PORK STUFFED AREA.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.509
- NOW GO.
- RIGHT HERE.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.141
OKAY, JOE, WOULD YOU
PLEASE JUST GO ALREADY?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.143
WILL YOU STOP, PLEASE? I'M
NOT LEAVING HIM LIKE THIS.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.574
LOOK AT ME.

15:45.575 --> 15:47.016
HE LOOKS TERRIBLE.

15:47.017 --> 15:48.347
HE ALWAYS LOOKS TERRIBLE.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.380
NOW WOULD YOU JUST GO?

15:52.382 --> 15:53.382
I DON'T THINK I
EVER TOLD YOU THIS,

15:53.383 --> 15:55.154
BUT WHEN WE WERE 10 YEARS
OLD AND PLAYING "A-TEAM"

15:55.155 --> 15:57.286
IN THE BACKYARD, AND
MY SISTER MEREDITH

15:57.287 --> 15:59.458
HAD TO JUDGE WHICH ONE OF US
WOULD BE BETTER AT BEING MR. T,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.590
AND WHO WOULD SAY
"I PITY THE FOOL."

16:01.591 --> 16:04.963
WELL, AFTERWARDS,
MEREDITH TOLD ME

16:04.964 --> 16:07.266
( mockingly ) "YOU LOVE AUSTIN."

16:07.267 --> 16:09.268
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- I PUNCHED HER.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.669
- WHY?
- I WAS MR. T.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.001
THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD DO.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.072
AND I WAS WEARING A LOT OF RINGS

16:13.073 --> 16:14.404
- SO IT REALLY HURT.
- AHH.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.507
MEL, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

16:18.508 --> 16:19.648
SURE, WHAT?

16:19.649 --> 16:21.480
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR SISTER WOULD SAY

16:21.481 --> 16:22.581
IF SHE WERE HERE RIGHT NOW?

16:22.582 --> 16:25.355
"I JUST ESCAPED FROM JAIL.
HIDE ME."

16:26.316 --> 16:28.087
I THINK SHE WOULD
GIVE ME THAT SMUG

16:28.088 --> 16:29.618
SMILE OF HERS AND SAY.

16:29.619 --> 16:33.162
"SEE, MELLY? BIG SISTERS
ALWAYS KNOW BETTER."

16:33.163 --> 16:34.293
AND THEN I'D HAVE
TO PUNCH HER AGAIN.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.325
( both chuckle )

16:36.326 --> 16:38.397
DOES IT HURT WHEN I
TOUCH RIGHT HERE.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.768
( winces, groans )

16:39.769 --> 16:41.300
SEE, HE'S FINE.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.732
NOW WOULD YOU JUST GET
DOWN TO THAT RESTAURANT

16:43.733 --> 16:46.035
AND STOP THAT PROPOSAL?
EVERY MINUTE COUNTS.

16:46.036 --> 16:49.178
I DON'T THINK IT'S A
STOMACH ACHE, LENNOX.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.310
WILL YOU STOP EATING?!

16:55.085 --> 16:57.146
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
I ORDERED YOU DESSERT.

16:57.147 --> 16:59.618
NO, I LIKE A MAN
WHO TAKES CHARGE.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.150
WELL, NOT REALLY. I JUST
LIKE GETTING DESSERT.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.292
( cellphone rings )

17:03.293 --> 17:04.623
I'M SORRY, IT JUST
KEEPS RINGING.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.295
IT'S JUST USUALLY WORK.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.627
I'LL TURN IT OFF.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.399
OOH, THAT ONE LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.430
DO YOU MIND IF WE SWITCH?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.431
NO NO NO NO. THE
STRAWBERRY ONE'S FOR YOU.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.602
IT'S MUCH MUCH BETTER.

17:13.603 --> 17:15.364
WELL THEN WHY'D YOU GET
THE CHOCOLATE ONE?

17:15.365 --> 17:16.665
SO THEN I'D KNOW
WHICH ONE WAS YOURS.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.337
AUSTIN, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.309
JUST A LITTLE TENSE.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.071
NOTHING A GOOD
PARFAIT WON'T CURE.

17:22.072 --> 17:24.313
YOU PUT A LOT OF
FAITH IN DESSERT.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.346
WE ARE VERY COMPATIBLE.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.078
I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

17:29.079 --> 17:31.150
MISS BURKE, YOUR NIECE HAS
BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.152
- SHE SAYS IT'S URGENT.
- OKAY.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.155
LENNOX, HONEY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.626
REALLY? IS HE OKAY?

17:37.627 --> 17:39.558
OF COURSE. I'M ON MY WAY.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.589
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:40.590 --> 17:42.161
JOE TOOK RYDER TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.292
HIS APPENDIX WAS ABOUT TO BURST.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.294
- HE'S GOING INTO SURGERY.
- SO HE'S OKAY.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.266
I HOPE. I'LL FIND OUT
WHEN I GET THERE.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.467
NO, PLEASE. AFTER THE PARFAIT.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.068
JUST EAT THE PARFAIT.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.700
AUSTIN, I REALLY DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE PARFAIT RIGHT NOW.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.303
MY NEPHEW'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
I NEED TO BE THERE.

17:54.504 --> 17:57.075
THERE, THERE, SEE?
LOOK, IT'S A RING.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.248
THIS IS WHY YOU HAD TO GET
THE STRAWBERRY PARFAIT.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.280
NOW COULD YOU JUST PLEASE SIT
DOWN SO I CAN PROPOSE TO YOU.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.182
WOW.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.184
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.785
I HAVE TO GO.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.617
REALLY? COME ON,
RYDER IS IN SURGERY.

18:08.618 --> 18:09.818
HE'LL BE THERE FOR
LIKE TWO HOURS.

18:09.819 --> 18:12.161
WHAT CAN YOU DO THAT
THE DOCTORS CAN'T?

18:12.162 --> 18:13.292
AND BESIDES, JOE'S THERE.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.464
LET'S SIT.

18:15.465 --> 18:17.095
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.298
( exhales ) OKAY, FINE.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.669
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?

18:20.670 --> 18:23.172
NO.

18:23.173 --> 18:24.334
JOE'S THERE.

18:29.579 --> 18:30.879
LENNOX.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.341
HOW'S RYDER? WHERE'S JOE?

18:32.342 --> 18:34.513
RYDER'S WITH THE DOCTORS.
JOE'S IN THERE WITH HIM.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.645
HE CONVINCED THE HEAD OF THE
DEPARTMENT TO DO RYDER'S SURGERY.

18:36.646 --> 18:37.786
HE WOULDN'T TAKE
NO FOR AN ANSWER.

18:37.787 --> 18:39.648
USING HIS OBNOXIOUS
POWERS FOR GOOD.

18:39.649 --> 18:41.150
GLAD HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

18:41.151 --> 18:42.651
NOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.653
WHAT HAPPENED AT DINNER? I
DON'T SEE ANY BAD DECISIONS

18:44.654 --> 18:45.654
ON YOUR RING FINGER.

18:45.655 --> 18:47.396
YOU KNEW AUSTIN WAS PROPOSING?

18:47.397 --> 18:49.398
YES. AND I TOLD JOE,
AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY

18:49.399 --> 18:51.129
DOWN THERE TO STOP IT,
BUT THEN STUPID RYDER

18:51.130 --> 18:52.161
MESSED UP THE PLAN.

18:52.162 --> 18:53.732
BY DEVIOUSLY BURSTING
HIS APPENDIX?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.304
YEAH. BIG WHINER.

18:55.305 --> 18:57.606
NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU, RYDER.

18:57.607 --> 18:59.638
ALL I DID WAS ASK THE DOCTORS

18:59.639 --> 19:01.270
IF THEY ALL WENT TO MEDICAL
SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY.

19:01.271 --> 19:04.473
HOW IS THAT HOSTILE?!

19:04.474 --> 19:05.574
HOW IS THAT HOSTILE?

19:05.575 --> 19:07.176
HUH?

19:07.177 --> 19:08.317
MEL, YOU'RE HERE.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.549
GOOD. ALL RIGHT, SO LOOK,
RYDER'S IN SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.321
IT SHOULD BE SMOOTH SAILING.
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME,

19:12.322 --> 19:14.854
BUT I THINK I PUT TOGETHER
A VERY GOOD SURGICAL TEAM.

19:16.326 --> 19:18.728
THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST IS
LIKE NUMBER ONE ON YELP.

19:19.929 --> 19:21.660
HE SHOULD BE OUT OF THERE
IN LIKE 45 MINUTES, TOPS.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.562
ALTHOUGH I TOLD
THEM NOT TO RUSH!

19:23.563 --> 19:25.434
- JOE.
- YEAH?

19:25.435 --> 19:27.637
I LOVE YOU.

19:31.341 --> 19:32.801
COOL. SO LOOK, RYDER'S
GONNA BE IN THE HOSPITAL

19:32.802 --> 19:34.172
LIKE TWO DAYS,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.374
SO YOU CAN TAKE THE FIRST NIGHT,

19:35.375 --> 19:36.575
I CAN TAKE THE SECOND NIGHT.
OR WHATEVER.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.176
I COULD TAKE THE FIRST NIGHT, YOU
COULD TAKE THE SECOND NIGHT.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.678
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
- JOE, DID YOU HEAR ME?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.380
YEAH, YOU JUST SAID YOU LOVE ME.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.382
YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.314
RYDER THOUGHT THIS WAS
ALL ABOUT THE PORK.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.856
BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS PORK
DOESN'T CAUSE THAT KIND OF...

19:47.857 --> 19:50.319
- OH, YOU DRIVE ME NUTS!
- YOU DRIVE ME NUTS TOO,

19:50.320 --> 19:52.190
BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.462
AUSTIN WANTED ME TO MARRY HIM,

19:53.463 --> 19:54.863
- AND I SAID NO.
- THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.395
I NEVER THOUGHT HE
WAS RIGHT FOR YOU.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.666
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT'S
RIGHT FOR ME?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.328
NO.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.670
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN AM I WRONG?

20:01.671 --> 20:02.771
( chuckles )

20:02.772 --> 20:04.403
SOMETIMES I JUST WANT
TO STRANGLE YOU.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.906
OH, WOULD YOU TWO JUST
STOP TALKING AND KISS?!

20:15.214 --> 20:17.246
SEE? THAT WORKS.

20:17.247 --> 20:19.388
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE
KISSING, YOU'RE NOT TALKING.

20:19.389 --> 20:20.650
WELL, I...

20:29.799 --> 20:31.400
THE DOCTOR SAYS
RYDER'S DOING GREAT,

20:31.401 --> 20:33.362
BUT HE'LL WAKE UP
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

20:33.363 --> 20:35.304
OKAY, WELL, I'LL TAKE
THE FIRST NIGHT HERE.

20:35.305 --> 20:36.335
NO NO NO. YOU'VE DEALT
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.836
I SHOULD DO THE FIRST NIGHT.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.808
LET'S BE HONEST. NO ONE'S GONNA
BE LEAVING HERE TONIGHT.

20:39.809 --> 20:42.741
SO THE QUESTION
OF THE EVENING IS

20:42.742 --> 20:44.813
UNIDENTIFIED MEAT,

20:44.814 --> 20:48.677
OR UNIDENTIFIED
MEAT WITH CHEESE?

20:48.678 --> 20:50.819
- THE MACHINE HAVE ANY WINE?
- IT'S A HOSPITAL.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.953
OKAY, MORPHINE,
CODEINE, SOMETHING?

20:56.686 --> 20:59.289
WE'RE REALLY GONNA GIVE
YOU AND ME A GO, HUH?

21:00.390 --> 21:01.390
WE ARE.

21:01.391 --> 21:03.792
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

21:03.793 --> 21:05.865
I THINK IT CALLS FOR A
LITTLE CELEBRATION.

21:07.937 --> 21:10.469
OOH.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.970
LOOK WHO SNUCK DOWN TO
THE ALL-NIGHT MINI MART

21:11.971 --> 21:13.542
AND GRABBED SOME CHEAP WINE.

21:13.543 --> 21:16.305
OH, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I
DON'T WANT TO STRANGLE YOU.

21:16.306 --> 21:19.007
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KILL THE
BEST GUY YOU'VE EVER BEEN WITH?

21:19.008 --> 21:21.010
AND THEN SUDDENLY I DO AGAIN.
