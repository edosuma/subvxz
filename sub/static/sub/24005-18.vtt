Well, Mark, that first couple
swings it twisted a little bit.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.632
You did get some chipping

37:39.632 --> 37:42.927
on the edge here
right in that sweet spot.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.597
Otherwise,
everything's still tight.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.848
It felt good. Good job.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.475
- Thank you.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.435
- Nicholas, what
are you thinking?

37:50.435 --> 37:51.644
- Little nervous.
- That's all right.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.855
We're gonna do it anyway, so...

37:53.855 --> 37:54.731
- Oh, I know. I wouldn't
expect anything less.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.733
- Cool.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.401
<i>- I'm especially nervous</i>

37:58.401 --> 38:01.070

38:01.070 --> 38:03.948
This is gonna be a make or

38:03.948 --> 38:05.198
<i>Hopefully, not literally.</i>

38:32.435 --> 38:36.022
- Nicholas, this was
difficult to control.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.566
It's very forward-heavy.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.695
You got chipping on the edge
here in a couple spots.

38:42.695 --> 38:47.408
The real killer for me though,
was the seam in your handle.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.494
This right here is sharp.

38:49.494 --> 38:52.455
Most of your control
is in these three fingers,

38:52.455 --> 38:54.582
and these two
are getting cut into.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.544
So the handle's a problem.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.799
- All right, gentlemen.
Next up, the sharpness test.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.135
To test the sharpness of
your blade and that sawback,

39:06.135 --> 39:09.055
I'll be sawing through a rope,
it's gonna release a bag,

39:09.055 --> 39:10.932
and I'll be cutting the bag.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.267
Mark, you're up first.
Are you ready?

39:43.464 --> 39:46.301
The blade, even though it took
damage in the last test,

39:46.301 --> 39:48.136
didn't affect
its cutting at all.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.263
The handle's very,
very comfortable.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.598
It's definitely a good cutter.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.224
Nicely done.

these back saw blades,

40:22.921 --> 40:24.839
It went through the rope
quite nicely.

40:24.839 --> 40:28.134
The blade, beautifully sharp,
cut right through there.

40:28.134 --> 40:31.012
The issue I have is right here,

40:31.012 --> 40:33.806
a couple of those ridges

a sharp spot right there.
