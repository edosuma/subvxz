WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:17.643
"All I can be is sorry,
and that is all I am."

00:51.218 --> 00:53.387
But I'm afraid you still don't mean it.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.712
We'll try again in the morning.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.961
See you tomorrow, Helly.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.435
Fuck me.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.567
I read it 300 times yesterday.

02:31.985 --> 02:36.698
259. Again, please. Now.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.662
What the hell is that voice?

02:59.513 --> 03:03.183
"Forgive me for the harm
I have caused this world.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.479
None may atone for my actions but me.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.781
And only in me
shall their stain live on."

03:30.294 --> 03:32.087
I really am sorry, okay?

03:35.174 --> 03:36.341
I'm sorry.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.597
No paraphrasing. Again.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.563
- Mark?
- Yep?

06:36.647 --> 06:41.276
It's past 1100, and Helly's been
in the break room since yesterday.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.737
- Okay?
- I wonder if, as department chief,

06:43.820 --> 06:46.406
you feel you should check on her progress?

06:46.490 --> 06:47.950
- Well…
- Mark doesn't have that power.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.743
- Well, he can ask.
- He's not going to.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.827
- He might.
- Okay--

06:50.911 --> 06:52.329
Hi.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.167
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

06:58.293 --> 07:02.130
We met the other day.
I'm Burt from Optics and Design.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.884
- Hi, Irving.
- Hi, Burt. What are you doing here?

07:05.968 --> 07:07.219
Exactly how the wet fuck do you know

07:07.302 --> 07:08.387
- where this office is?
- Dylan!

07:08.470 --> 07:12.641
My predecessor, Alice K., came here
once when they still did the summits,

07:12.724 --> 07:15.018
- and she'd left directions.
- Give us them reversed.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.228
Okay. It's all right.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.771
What can we do for you, Burt?

07:17.855 --> 07:19.064
Thank you. Well…

07:19.857 --> 07:21.859
Irving, I kept thinking
about what you said

07:21.942 --> 07:25.445
about being excited
for the new handbook totes,

07:25.529 --> 07:27.489
and maybe you were kidding and teasing.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.366
No, not at all.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.703
Okay, good. I've been fretting,
though, because you mentioned

07:32.786 --> 07:36.039
the anticipation could distract
from your work,

07:36.123 --> 07:37.708
which was the opposite of my intent.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.961
So I figured, heck,
let's bring them over now.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.505
That way, it won't be on your mind.

07:43.589 --> 07:48.594
You brought pre-release handbook totes
for us?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.638
It seemed like the right thing.
I know your time is valuable.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.892
Okay, well, you can drop 'em on the desk.
Long hike back to O&D.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.685
Right.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.563
I also wanted to extend an invitation.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.316
Again, I know you-- you work hard, so…

08:02.983 --> 08:06.904
if an informal tour of O&D
ever sounds refreshing,

08:06.987 --> 08:10.991
I'd be happy to personally offer that
to Irving and any one of you.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.494
Directions are in the front bag, reversed.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.662
Hard pass.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.625
Okay.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.711
Thank you, Burt.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
Thank you.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.599
Just seems soon to be
taking him up on his offer.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.644
It's absurd we've never visited them
before now.

08:39.144 --> 08:43.565
Kier's whole original vision saw
us all working together.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.818
That was before O&D started
disemboweling people's bowels.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.238
Nonsense. I'll be back by 1:00.

08:50.948 --> 08:51.990
He's gonna die.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.077
Irv--

09:04.169 --> 09:05.295
How many times?

09:08.507 --> 09:10.384
1,072.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.915
What about the voice behind the door?

09:42.541 --> 09:43.667
Crying baby, you mean?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.838
No. Like, the angry, mumbly guy.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.675
Guys? We're really not supposed to talk
about the break room.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.927
You know, the important thing is,

09:54.011 --> 09:56.889
you apologized correctly,
and now you're out.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.433
What you gotta do is trick the machine

09:59.516 --> 10:01.560
by thinking about something
you're really sorry about,

10:01.643 --> 10:05.439
so I like to imagine my outie's love-made
with a MILF or two,

10:05.522 --> 10:08.609
which is obviously badass,
but I do pity the husbands.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.714
Hey.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.759
Break room sucks.

10:33.842 --> 10:38.180
But that's why we have protocols
and procedures so we don't end up there.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.933
You'll learn. I promise.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.030
Hello?

10:56.907 --> 10:58.200
Who's that?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.493
Hi.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.830
It's Irving B. from Macrodata Refinement.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.999
We met in the hall the other day.

11:09.253 --> 11:11.338
Burt's over there by shelf six.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.757
Don't touch anything.

11:16.885 --> 11:20.722
The big envelopes can handle
an appendix reissue.

11:20.806 --> 11:26.311
But, of course,
we ship all the hallway pieces in-frame.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.065
So much to remember.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.443
Felicia and I make do.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.740
I'm sure it's easier than whatever
you MDR kids get up to all day.

11:39.658 --> 11:43.287
I can only imagine what it's like
when the new art comes in.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.581
I mean, you see it before anyone.

11:46.540 --> 11:51.086
It's so dumb, but I actually cried

11:51.170 --> 11:54.047
when you guys put up
<i>The Youthful Convalescence of Kier</i> .

11:54.131 --> 11:55.632
- No.
- I did.

11:55.716 --> 11:59.386
I never thought I'd see
the handbook passage depicted visually.

11:59.469 --> 12:05.851
It was only up for a month or so,
but, man. What a month.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.524
Come here.

12:14.276 --> 12:18.989
Once the hall art's been cycled
through all the departments,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.283
it ends up back here.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.367
Wow!

12:25.996 --> 12:27.497
Where did Felicia go?

12:27.581 --> 12:28.582
Supply run.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.587
Voilà.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.720
"Let not weakness live in your veins.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.890
Cherished workers, drown it inside you."

12:45.390 --> 12:48.435
"Rise up from your deathbed
and sally forth,

12:48.977 --> 12:53.190
more perfect for the struggle."

12:54.441 --> 12:55.442
Exactly.

12:55.984 --> 12:56.985
I--

12:58.111 --> 12:59.363
I can't believe you--

13:01.031 --> 13:02.282
you have this.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.217
I'm sorry. What time is it?

13:20.843 --> 13:21.844
I have to go.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.320
Hey, Helly.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.323
- I got to 4%.
- Yes!

13:43.407 --> 13:44.491
Feels good, right?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.745
- I guess.
- Awesome. I'm glad you agree.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.292
Great work.

15:25.968 --> 15:26.969
What's this?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.179
Will you put that away?

15:31.014 --> 15:33.225
- Put what away?
- It's a map of the hallways.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.726
No, it isn't.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.854
I thought we weren't
supposed to make maps.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.815
We're not. I didn't.
It's just something I found.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.899
I think Petey made it.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.776
Oh, shit. You didn't turn it in?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.529
You're such a hypocrite,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.656
lecturing me on following the rules.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.450
I wasn't lecturing you. I'm just trying
to keep you out of the break room.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.578
I can't believe Petey was a mapper.
Let me see it.

15:53.370 --> 15:58.542
He's got wellness, management, perpetuity…
Everywhere we know of.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.210
This must've taken him weeks.

16:00.294 --> 16:01.962
Why aren't we supposed to map the office?

16:02.045 --> 16:05.382
It's an Eagan rule.
"Render not my creation in miniature."

16:05.465 --> 16:06.466
Why?

16:07.384 --> 16:08.886
What the fuck is this?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.305
They look like houses, right?
That's how houses look.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.933
Yeah, exactly,
because these are random, bored doodles.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.769
Well, maybe they're on the outside
and Petey found a way to get to them.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.314
So why would they be on a map
of the severed floor?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.899
It could be a thing. You don't know.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.150
It's not a thing.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.110
Clearly he was trying
to tell you something.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.445
No.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.655
Go lick a boot, Mark.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.201
You're more loyal to this place
than to your friend.

16:32.868 --> 16:36.705
I'm loyal to how it felt around here
before you showed up.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.040
You mean when Petey was here?

16:38.123 --> 16:40.083
Yeah, because there was balance.

16:40.167 --> 16:44.755
We could have fun and work without
the whole goddamn department imploding.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.298
The work is bullshit.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.635
The work is mysterious and important.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.721
And we deal with
the uncertainty it brings us

16:52.804 --> 16:55.432
in the way that Kier would've wanted.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.019
Together, as a family.

17:00.521 --> 17:04.107
I could not, with a razor to my throat,

17:04.733 --> 17:07.277
be less interested in being your family.

17:13.242 --> 17:16.744
Your best friend left this for you,
and you don't give a shit.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.682
You're right. I don't give a shit.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.766
Mark--

17:41.478 --> 17:45.649
There. It's gone. Thank you, Helly.
Now we can get back to work.

17:50.904 --> 17:51.905
Mark!

17:54.533 --> 17:55.993
It's an emergency.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.496
Okay. All right--

17:59.580 --> 18:00.831
I was going to get Mr. Milchick,

18:00.914 --> 18:03.041
but I thought it best
not to break the chain of command.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.502
It's just raining
contraband today.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.087
- What do you mean?
- It doesn't matter.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.340
Has anyone seen anything like this before?

18:10.424 --> 18:12.092
Passage 31, page 110.

18:12.176 --> 18:17.931
"Be content in my words, and dally not
in the scholastic pursuits of lesser men."

18:18.015 --> 18:19.933
No books except the handbook. I know.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.604
What are you doing?

18:23.687 --> 18:25.814
His ego's pissed 'cause
Helly called him out for boot-licking.

18:25.898 --> 18:29.193
- My ego's fine. I'm just trying to--
- Damn.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.862
Mark, what is this?

18:31.945 --> 18:34.865
Maybe it's another Petey message.
Flip through. See if my name's anywhere.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.451
I bet it's a loyalty test.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.786
Remember the spicy candy?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.330
I'll be turning this in to Milchick.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.291
What? Why? It's booty.
It's booty with your name on it.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.501
Excellent decision, Mark.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.629
This is an idolatrous text
that should be brought to him immediately.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.449
So what's their space like?
Stalactites and shit?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.827
No, it's nice. Burt's fostered
a really welcoming environment.

19:20.911 --> 19:23.497
He understands the spirit of Lumon.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.041
Helly?

19:28.377 --> 19:29.419
Excuse me! Helly!

19:29.503 --> 19:30.629
Jesus, Helly!

19:30.712 --> 19:31.964
I want a camera!

19:32.047 --> 19:35.384
- I am so sorry, Ms. Cobel. I will--
- What is happening here?

19:35.467 --> 19:38.303
What's happening is,
you're going to give me a video camera

19:38.387 --> 19:43.100
so I can tape a resignation to my outie
right fucking now,

19:43.183 --> 19:46.478
or you're going to have to explain to her
why she's missing four fingers.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.523
Okay. Let's just--

19:50.107 --> 19:51.942
It's Cobel, right?

19:52.526 --> 19:53.527
Yes.

19:54.528 --> 19:58.574
Cobel, do I look like
I'm fucking around right now?

19:58.657 --> 20:01.702
No. No, you do not.

20:01.785 --> 20:02.786
Helly!

20:04.204 --> 20:08.709
Hi, Mark.
I'm just catching up with your trainee.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.422
Mr. Milchick,

20:14.339 --> 20:16.758
could you get the video camera, please?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.119
Hey.

21:16.818 --> 21:21.240
Well, boss. I guess this is the part
where I should tell you to go to hell.

21:23.075 --> 21:24.493
Except you're already here.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.461
I was never sorry.

21:56.650 --> 21:57.943
<i>Helly,</i>

21:58.944 --> 22:01.822
<i>I watched your video asking that I resign.</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:06.034
<i>I also received and responded
to your previous request.</i>

22:06.577 --> 22:08.120
<i>I assumed that would resolve the issue,</i>

22:08.203 --> 22:13.417
<i>but now Ms. Cobel says
you threatened to cut off your fingers?</i>

22:17.921 --> 22:22.676
<i>I understand that you're unhappy
with the life that you've been given.</i>

22:24.011 --> 22:27.014
<i>But you know what?
Eventually, we all have to accept reality.</i>

22:28.056 --> 22:31.059
<i>So, here it is.</i>

22:33.520 --> 22:35.272
<i>I am a person.</i>

22:36.982 --> 22:38.358
<i>You are not.</i>

22:40.068 --> 22:41.862
<i>I make the decisions.</i>

22:43.280 --> 22:44.573
<i>You do not.</i>

22:45.657 --> 22:49.494
<i>And if you ever do anything to my fingers,</i>

22:50.078 --> 22:53.540
<i>know that I will keep you alive
long enough to horribly regret that.</i>

22:56.251 --> 22:58.462
<i>Your resignation request is denied.</i>

22:59.671 --> 23:00.672
<i>Turn it off.</i>

23:17.689 --> 23:21.527
<i>"Welcome your child
into a world surrounded by nature."</i>

23:22.236 --> 23:23.529
No, thanks.

23:25.072 --> 23:29.618
"Scroll down to explore
our rustic birthing cabins."

23:31.245 --> 23:32.287
I don't know. It just--

23:33.080 --> 23:38.418
It looks more like a shitty ski resort
than a birthing center to me, but…

23:38.961 --> 23:40.003
<i>Okay, sure, fine.</i>

23:40.087 --> 23:42.297
<i>But it's gonna be awesome.
And you're gonna like it.</i>

23:42.381 --> 23:46.176
How much of this was Ricken's idea,
300% or 400%?

23:46.260 --> 23:47.469
<i>Just--</i>

23:47.553 --> 23:50.556
<i>Get all of your snark out now or
you're never gonna earn your uncle badge.</i>

23:50.639 --> 23:54.643
You know what? I think I might have
some more snark in me. I'm kinda tired.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.937
- <i>Call you tomorrow?</i>
- Okay, bye.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.123
Have you heard from the Board yet?

25:01.335 --> 25:02.669
No.

25:03.754 --> 25:06.465
Kilmer wasn't your fault,
and it certainly wasn't mine.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.841
They'll understand.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.431
It wasn't your fault, Harmony.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.604
If you want a hug,
go to hell and find your mother.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.772
Jesus.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.023
Since Petey reintegrated--

25:23.106 --> 25:25.108
The Board's never acknowledged
reintegration.

25:25.192 --> 25:27.945
We have to get his chip.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.784
His corpse is scheduled to be destroyed
by cremation

25:33.867 --> 25:35.953
following his funeral on Sunday.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.829
FYI.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
Vision.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.225
Verve.

25:59.309 --> 26:00.310
Wit.

26:01.562 --> 26:02.771
Cheer.

26:03.814 --> 26:04.982
Humility.

26:05.774 --> 26:07.401
Benevolence.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.778
Nimbleness.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.115
Probity.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.909
Wiles.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.580
Wiles.

26:51.778 --> 26:52.905
Mark.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.198
Mrs. Selvig?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.824
- What are you doing here?
- Wh--

26:57.117 --> 27:02.623
I'm-- You know, the news report
said that he worked at Lumon,

27:02.706 --> 27:06.376
so I thought maybe I knew him.
What are you doing here?

27:06.460 --> 27:10.380
He used to come by my shop.
He adored my hibiscus wrap.

27:10.464 --> 27:14.176
Oh, my God. Wow, it's a small world.

27:14.259 --> 27:16.220
Poor, poor man.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.681
Well, on the upside,
at least now we both have a date.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.436
There he is.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.522
If you'd like to go in
and pay your respects,

27:26.605 --> 27:27.856
I'll wait right here for you.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.984
I think I might swing by the bathroom,
but I'll see you in a sec.

27:32.027 --> 27:34.154
- Service is starting soon.
- Yeah.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.335
Whiskey. Rocks.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.212
It's just wine, sir.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.130
Right. Red, please.

28:26.665 --> 28:28.667
Hello. Were you a friend?

28:31.587 --> 28:32.880
He was my dad.

28:33.589 --> 28:36.133
I'm so deeply sorry.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.390
I suppose you were close
and everything.

28:56.570 --> 28:57.696
White, please.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.997
I'm sorry, I don't know you. I'm Nina.

29:07.748 --> 29:08.749
Mark Scout.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.710
I'm Peter's ex-wife.

29:13.170 --> 29:15.631
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

29:20.552 --> 29:22.095
You're from Lumon.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.941
So you didn't even know him at all.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.820
- I just figured I knew him, and--
- Hey, Mom.

29:38.904 --> 29:40.030
They wanna start.

29:40.614 --> 29:41.615
Okay, baby.

29:42.241 --> 29:45.077
Hi. You're-- Are you June?

29:46.245 --> 29:47.538
Yeah.

29:48.205 --> 29:49.331
It's nice to meet you.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.027
So you knew my dad?

30:21.738 --> 30:22.739
Yeah.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.494
At work.

30:28.996 --> 30:30.122
You're one of those.

30:31.665 --> 30:32.958
Do you ever think that maybe

30:33.041 --> 30:35.335
the best way to deal
with a fucked-up situation in your life

30:35.419 --> 30:37.671
isn't to just shut your brain off
half the time?

30:41.133 --> 30:42.843
I'm not exactly sure.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.764
I'm sorry.

30:48.307 --> 30:50.184
<i>We're gonna perform
something for you.</i>

30:52.477 --> 30:54.313
<i>I'm glad you're here, babe.</i>

30:54.396 --> 30:56.940
<i>We're gonna play a-- We're gon--
We're gonna melt your face off.</i>

30:57.024 --> 30:59.276
- <i>We're gonna rock to it.</i>
- <i>Gonna play some rock and roll.</i>

30:59.860 --> 31:01.486
<i>Rock show time!</i>

31:06.992 --> 31:09.077
<i>Say your prayers, little one</i>

31:09.161 --> 31:10.871
<i>Don't forget, my son</i>

31:10.954 --> 31:13.165
<i>To include everyone</i>

31:15.042 --> 31:17.294
<i>Tuck you in, warm within</i>

31:17.377 --> 31:18.921
<i>Keep you free from sin</i>

31:19.004 --> 31:20.589
<i>Till the sandman, he comes</i>

31:23.175 --> 31:26.386
<i>Sleep with one eye open</i>

31:27.221 --> 31:30.098
<i>Gripping your pillow tight</i>

31:30.182 --> 31:32.768
<i>Exit light</i>

31:34.019 --> 31:37.981
<i>Enter night</i>

31:38.065 --> 31:40.692
<i>Grain of sand</i>

31:41.693 --> 31:44.363
<i>We're off to never-never land</i>

31:51.787 --> 31:53.914
<i>Something's wrong, shut the light</i>

31:53.997 --> 31:57.835
<i>Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White</i>

31:59.711 --> 32:01.672
<i>Dreams of war, dreams of liars</i>

32:01.755 --> 32:03.632
<i>Dreams of dragon's fire</i>

32:03.715 --> 32:05.717
<i>And of things that will bite</i>

32:08.011 --> 32:10.973
<i>Sleep with one eye open</i>

32:12.140 --> 32:14.852
<i>Gripping your pillow tight</i>

32:14.935 --> 32:17.354
<i>Exit light</i>

32:18.480 --> 32:22.609
<i>Enter night</i>

32:22.693 --> 32:25.237
<i>Take my hand</i>

32:26.488 --> 32:28.282
<i>We're off to never-never land</i>

32:30.784 --> 32:32.411
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep</i>

32:32.494 --> 32:34.872
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep</i>

32:34.955 --> 32:36.623
<i>And if I die before I wake</i>

32:36.707 --> 32:38.125
<i>And if I die before I wake</i>

32:38.709 --> 32:40.502
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to take</i>

32:40.586 --> 32:42.713
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to take</i>

32:42.796 --> 32:46.133
<i>Hush, little baby, don't say a word</i>

32:46.717 --> 32:50.220
<i>And never mind that noise you heard</i>

32:50.804 --> 32:54.391
<i>It's just the monster under your bed</i>

32:54.474 --> 32:58.145
- <i>In your closet, in your head</i>
- <i>In your head</i>

32:58.228 --> 33:00.689
<i>Exit light</i>

33:02.149 --> 33:05.777
<i>Enter night</i>

33:05.861 --> 33:08.864
<i>Grain of sand</i>

33:10.157 --> 33:11.867
<i>We're off to never-never land</i>

33:22.419 --> 33:23.629
<i>No!</i>

33:25.881 --> 33:26.840
<i>No!</i>

33:28.967 --> 33:32.346
<i>What-- What if you went
so fast that smoke started coming out?</i>

33:32.429 --> 33:33.430
<i>Out of your ears.</i>

33:53.367 --> 33:55.869
Mark, sweetheart, are you all right?
I'm so sorry.

33:55.953 --> 33:57.829
- Yeah.
- I think I have this cystitis under--

33:57.913 --> 33:59.748
This was a mistake. I have to go.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.917
- Okay, well, let me come with you.
- No, that's not necessary.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.044
- No, I've paid my respects. Let's go.
- Let us pray.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.629
Our Father, who art in heaven…

34:07.381 --> 34:10.467
So, was the funeral just too sad, or--

34:12.844 --> 34:14.679
Something like that, yeah.

34:14.763 --> 34:16.264
If you ever wanna talk--

34:16.348 --> 34:20.226
Oh, no. Thank you. I just-- I'm fine.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.148
But thank you for, you know,
being my funeral buddy today.

34:26.733 --> 34:27.818
Good night.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.360
Good night.

37:27.456 --> 37:28.665
That's Petey?

37:30.918 --> 37:32.669
That's Petey.

37:34.796 --> 37:35.797
How did you--

37:35.881 --> 37:39.134
Would you mind taking that
up to diagnostics for me?

37:46.058 --> 37:47.100
Yes?

37:53.065 --> 37:54.942
You requested me, Ms. Cobel?

37:55.526 --> 38:01.281
Ms. Casey, I'd like you to run
a special wellness session with Mark S.

38:01.949 --> 38:02.950
Mark S.?

38:03.825 --> 38:05.244
What's the problem?

38:08.622 --> 38:11.458
He just needs it. Trust me.

38:26.139 --> 38:29.184
"Kier invites you to drink of his water."

38:30.310 --> 38:32.563
- Irving.
- Felicia said you'd be here.

38:35.649 --> 38:39.611
Is it awful to say
I don't care for that one?

38:40.112 --> 38:41.113
No.

38:41.864 --> 38:44.491
Honestly, it makes me nervous too.

38:46.827 --> 38:49.830
Such a lovely vista, but I keep thinking…

38:49.913 --> 38:51.123
He could slip.

38:54.960 --> 38:59.756
It was a thrill to have someone from MDR
come see us,

38:59.840 --> 39:02.426
to take an interest like you did, so…

39:03.552 --> 39:04.803
if I embarrassed myself--

39:04.887 --> 39:05.888
You didn't.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.349
Unless, you did?

39:10.350 --> 39:11.643
Are you embarrassed?

39:14.479 --> 39:15.480
No.

39:17.816 --> 39:18.817
Good.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.197
I have four more stops.

39:26.825 --> 39:29.077
Would MDR consider joining me?

39:31.788 --> 39:32.873
MDR would.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.043
You're crazy.

39:36.627 --> 39:38.378
I wish I could nap.

39:39.129 --> 39:41.590
I think I sleep 15 hours a night up there.

39:41.673 --> 39:42.925
It's a character flaw.

39:43.008 --> 39:45.219
It just means you're a party guy,
disco king.

39:45.302 --> 39:47.554
I can't be falling asleep, Burt.

39:47.638 --> 39:50.015
- Who cares?
- The handbook cares.

39:50.098 --> 39:53.936
"No workplace
shall be repurposed for slumber."

39:54.019 --> 39:58.482
I know the handbook, old man.
I'm more of a first edition guy.

39:59.942 --> 40:06.615
The original word of Kier: "And I shall
whisper to ye dutiful through the ages.

40:06.698 --> 40:10.536
In your noblest thoughts and epiphanies
shall be my voice.

40:10.619 --> 40:13.038
You are my mouth,

40:13.622 --> 40:17.125
and through ye, I will whisper on

40:17.209 --> 40:19.837
when I am 10 centuries demised."

40:22.714 --> 40:24.299
I don't understand.

40:24.383 --> 40:28.846
He doesn't just speak to us
through the handbook or the paintings.

40:29.638 --> 40:31.265
He finds other ways.

40:34.476 --> 40:36.270
"You think you need your job.

40:37.938 --> 40:40.315
But I've lived abroad as a vagrant,

40:40.399 --> 40:45.195
abstaining from my own money
to rely on the charity of strangers.

40:45.779 --> 40:49.700
Most were beggars themselves,
yet they were happy.

40:50.450 --> 40:53.370
And so, for that summer, was I.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.666
Your job needs you,

40:59.042 --> 41:01.211
not the other way around."

41:06.967 --> 41:09.303
<i>Safe travels, MDR.</i>

41:10.262 --> 41:12.472
Thanks, O&D.

41:30.824 --> 41:32.034
Mark?

41:33.702 --> 41:34.953
I'm gonna go.

41:35.037 --> 41:36.205
Do it.

41:36.288 --> 41:39.416
I'm working up till the bell. I think
I may still crush this thing tonight.

41:40.751 --> 41:41.835
I hope you do.

41:45.172 --> 41:46.173
See you soon.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.486
Knew it.

42:55.409 --> 43:00.497
Sometimes I ask people
to sculpt how they feel out of clay.

43:01.415 --> 43:03.417
Would you like to do that?

43:07.796 --> 43:08.797
<i>All right.</i>

43:40.245 --> 43:45.751
"'Destiny'. An acrostic poem experience

44:07.147 --> 44:11.485
<i>"D is for dreaming,

44:17.032 --> 44:19.159
<i>E is for energy…</i>

44:21.161 --> 44:23.080

44:24.373 --> 44:26.625

45:04.496 --> 45:09.793
For destiny, friends,

45:11.962 --> 45:13.755
Hey. How are you?

45:13.839 --> 45:15.132
Good.

45:15.215 --> 45:17.384
Yeah? Seems like
you're getting the hang of stuff here.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.346
Cool.
