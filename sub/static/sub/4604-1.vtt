01:17.927 --> 01:18.916
Surprise!

01:22.665 --> 01:26.437
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

01:26.502 --> 01:28.766
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.738
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

01:31.806 --> 01:33.933
Hey, man, thanks.

01:35.644 --> 01:38.909
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

01:38.980 --> 01:41.778
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

01:41.850 --> 01:44.182
You came to the right place, my friend.

01:44.252 --> 01:47.312
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

01:47.389 --> 01:52.417
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

01:54.061 --> 01:56.689
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

01:56.764 --> 01:57.992
Oh, sorry.

01:58.065 --> 02:00.625
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

02:01.802 --> 02:05.238
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

02:05.306 --> 02:06.739
Happy birthday!

02:06.807 --> 02:09.207
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

02:09.276 --> 02:12.404
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

02:12.479 --> 02:15.539
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

02:15.616 --> 02:20.245
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.811
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

02:22.889 --> 02:25.187
Double digits. The big 1-0.

02:27.827 --> 02:28.987
You don't like it?

02:29.062 --> 02:31.326
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

02:31.397 --> 02:35.163
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

02:35.234 --> 02:38.169
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.935
It's just that
another year's come and gone

02:41.006 --> 02:43.065
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

02:43.141 --> 02:47.976
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

02:48.046 --> 02:50.810
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

02:50.882 --> 02:53.578
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

02:53.652 --> 02:55.552
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

02:55.620 --> 02:58.919
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

02:58.991 --> 03:01.653
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

03:01.727 --> 03:03.990
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

03:04.061 --> 03:06.461
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

03:06.530 --> 03:07.588
Works for me.

03:12.503 --> 03:14.869
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

03:14.939 --> 03:16.668
It's fun people fun time!

03:16.741 --> 03:20.541
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

03:21.545 --> 03:22.603
What day is it?

03:22.680 --> 03:25.080
It's Friday. Field trip day.

03:25.149 --> 03:28.413
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

03:28.585 --> 03:30.212
...in ten more minutes.

03:32.088 --> 03:33.180
Come on!

03:33.256 --> 03:36.157
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

03:36.226 --> 03:40.492
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

03:40.563 --> 03:41.894
Let's go.

03:41.965 --> 03:44.957
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

03:45.035 --> 03:49.028
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

03:49.105 --> 03:51.129
Right there. You see?

03:51.206 --> 03:54.334
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

03:54.410 --> 03:56.241
Let's go! Come on!

04:08.657 --> 04:12.115
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

04:15.663 --> 04:17.654
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

04:17.732 --> 04:21.531
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

04:23.671 --> 04:24.865
Ziploc fresh.

04:24.939 --> 04:27.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

04:27.675 --> 04:30.007
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

04:30.078 --> 04:31.909
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

04:31.979 --> 04:34.277
The king of New York City.

04:34.348 --> 04:36.872
Alex the lion.

04:37.851 --> 04:39.148
It's showtime.

04:43.757 --> 04:45.748
Roar!

04:55.769 --> 04:59.535
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

04:59.605 --> 05:03.336
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

05:37.142 --> 05:39.337
Just smile and wave, boys.

05:39.410 --> 05:41.275
Smile and wave.

05:41.346 --> 05:43.541
Kowalski, progress report.

05:44.048 --> 05:46.277
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

05:46.350 --> 05:49.342
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

05:49.419 --> 05:50.750
Right.

05:51.355 --> 05:54.381
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

05:54.558 --> 05:58.961
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

05:59.029 --> 06:00.291
And me, skipper?

06:00.364 --> 06:03.424
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.866
Today we're going to blow this dump.

06:05.936 --> 06:08.598
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

06:12.708 --> 06:15.506
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

06:16.179 --> 06:17.305
Ha-ha.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.316
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

06:21.384 --> 06:23.716
I hope you thought it was fresh.

06:23.786 --> 06:25.310
I'll be here all week.

06:25.388 --> 06:27.982
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

06:28.057 --> 06:30.389
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

06:30.526 --> 06:34.461
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

06:34.529 --> 06:38.056
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

06:38.767 --> 06:42.066
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

06:48.543 --> 06:51.910
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

06:51.980 --> 06:53.572
I sprechen.

06:53.648 --> 06:56.810
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.819
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.117
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.453
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.959
What are you guys doing?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.858
We're digging to Antarctica.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.094
Ant-who-tica?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.757
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

07:17.938 --> 07:22.135
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

07:22.208 --> 07:27.271
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.646
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

07:30.717 --> 07:34.744
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.254
To the wild.

07:37.924 --> 07:41.724
The wild?
You could actually go there?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.124
That sounds great.

07:44.930 --> 07:48.889
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.533
You didn't see anything.

07:52.604 --> 07:53.628
Right?

07:53.705 --> 07:55.400
Yes, sir.

07:55.474 --> 07:57.135
I'm sorry. No, sir.

07:58.944 --> 08:01.708
For his final appearance of the day,

08:01.880 --> 08:04.872
the king of New York City.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.607
Alex the lion.

08:06.817 --> 08:08.478
Roar!

08:12.223 --> 08:14.214
Thank you. Thank you very much.

08:14.292 --> 08:17.921
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

08:17.995 --> 08:20.293
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

08:20.364 --> 08:22.093
Oh! Well. Thank you.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.498
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

08:27.171 --> 08:28.297
Underpants!

08:28.372 --> 08:31.499
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

08:31.641 --> 08:34.166
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

08:42.519 --> 08:44.510
This is the life.

08:44.988 --> 08:46.717
That's the spot.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.621
Oh! I'm in heaven.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.196
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

09:01.270 --> 09:04.433
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

09:04.506 --> 09:05.803
A thermometer.

09:05.874 --> 09:09.742
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

09:10.713 --> 09:15.309
I wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

09:15.384 --> 09:17.476
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

09:17.552 --> 09:19.247
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

09:22.957 --> 09:24.822
Happy birthday to you

09:24.892 --> 09:26.826
You live in a zoo

09:26.894 --> 09:29.226
You look like a monkey

09:29.297 --> 09:32.130
And you smell like one too

09:33.968 --> 09:35.333
I say.

09:37.004 --> 09:39.938
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

09:40.006 --> 09:41.337
And yourselves.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.808
What? We worked
on that all week.

09:43.877 --> 09:46.675
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

09:52.352 --> 09:55.253
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

09:55.322 --> 09:56.482
Come on. Tell.

09:56.556 --> 09:58.888
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

09:58.959 --> 10:01.325
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

10:01.395 --> 10:04.227
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

10:04.296 --> 10:06.856
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

10:06.932 --> 10:08.194
Okay.

10:08.267 --> 10:12.567
I wished I could go to the wild!

10:12.638 --> 10:13.866
The wild?!

10:17.676 --> 10:19.268
I told you it was bad luck.

10:21.147 --> 10:22.978
The wild? Are you nuts?

10:23.048 --> 10:26.142
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.943
It's unsanitary.

10:30.021 --> 10:33.115
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

10:33.191 --> 10:34.715
The penguins are psychotic.

10:34.793 --> 10:38.194
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

10:38.263 --> 10:42.256
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

10:42.333 --> 10:44.801
I hear there's
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

10:44.869 --> 10:48.236
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

10:48.306 --> 10:51.570
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

10:51.642 --> 10:55.874
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.847
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

10:58.916 --> 11:00.816
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

11:00.884 --> 11:02.112
No, I just want...

11:02.186 --> 11:04.120
There's none of this in the wild.

11:04.188 --> 11:07.589
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

11:07.658 --> 11:09.489
that you do not find in the wild.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.791
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

11:12.862 --> 11:15.729
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

11:15.798 --> 11:19.666
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

11:19.735 --> 11:21.930
about life outside this zoo?

11:23.806 --> 11:25.068
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

11:25.141 --> 11:28.770
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

11:29.445 --> 11:32.573
You got a little schmutz
right there on your <i>...</i>

11:37.118 --> 11:41.578
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

11:41.656 --> 11:42.884
Really.

11:50.699 --> 11:51.859
What's eating him?

11:51.933 --> 11:55.869
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

11:55.937 --> 11:59.804
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

12:00.608 --> 12:03.042
I can see where this is going.

12:03.944 --> 12:06.742
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

12:17.224 --> 12:19.317
Come on. He's your best friend.

12:19.393 --> 12:22.385
All right, all right. Okay.

12:22.463 --> 12:25.056
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

12:48.020 --> 12:49.715
What a day.

12:49.788 --> 12:54.452
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

12:55.761 --> 12:58.889
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

13:00.098 --> 13:02.931
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

13:03.001 --> 13:04.025
Helicopter.

13:08.006 --> 13:09.666
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

13:09.740 --> 13:13.836
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

13:13.911 --> 13:15.037
Alex.

13:16.113 --> 13:17.375
Look at me.

13:17.448 --> 13:20.440
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

13:20.518 --> 13:24.318
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

13:24.388 --> 13:26.447
...or white with black stripes.

13:32.129 --> 13:33.356
Marty.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.763
I'm thinking of a song.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.698
Alex. Please. Not now.

13:38.768 --> 13:42.636
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

13:44.307 --> 13:46.867
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

13:46.943 --> 13:48.467
I'm not listening.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.111
Start spreadin' the news

13:52.182 --> 13:53.274
I don't know you.

13:53.350 --> 13:56.046
I'm leaving today

13:56.119 --> 14:00.817
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

14:01.724 --> 14:04.386
Come on. You know
you know the words.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.553
Two little words.

14:06.629 --> 14:07.823
New York.

14:07.896 --> 14:09.523
New York

14:09.598 --> 14:12.726
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

14:12.801 --> 14:14.632
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

14:14.703 --> 14:17.263
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

14:17.339 --> 14:19.568
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

14:19.641 --> 14:22.508
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

14:22.577 --> 14:26.240
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

14:26.314 --> 14:28.612
We make a great team, the two of us.

14:28.683 --> 14:31.345
We sure do. No doubt about it.

14:31.419 --> 14:35.014
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

14:35.089 --> 14:36.113
- No.
- Good.

14:36.190 --> 14:37.817
You and me. Let's go.

14:37.892 --> 14:39.018
- What?
- The wild.

14:39.093 --> 14:41.391
Come on. You and me together.

14:41.462 --> 14:44.897
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

14:44.965 --> 14:46.956
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

14:47.034 --> 14:49.696
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

14:49.770 --> 14:52.000
You're joking. Right?

14:54.875 --> 14:59.574
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

14:59.646 --> 15:01.307
Like we're going to get a train.

15:02.883 --> 15:05.613
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

15:05.686 --> 15:09.644
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

15:09.722 --> 15:13.283
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

15:13.759 --> 15:17.024
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

15:17.096 --> 15:19.929
Give them a little jolt. You know?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.134
Good night, AllyAI.

15:32.944 --> 15:35.742
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

15:35.814 --> 15:37.907
Don't worry. It's cool.

15:38.383 --> 15:40.351
You know, I got it.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.183
Much better.

16:12.149 --> 16:14.549
Come on, now, baby.

16:14.618 --> 16:16.710
My little filet.

16:16.786 --> 16:20.017
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

16:20.089 --> 16:23.991
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

16:24.060 --> 16:28.360
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

16:28.431 --> 16:31.161
Alex. Alex. Alex!

16:31.234 --> 16:32.531
What? What?

16:32.602 --> 16:33.728
You suck your thumb?

16:34.570 --> 16:35.696
What is it, Melman?

16:35.772 --> 16:38.673
You know how I have
that bladder infection

16:38.741 --> 16:40.605
and I have to get up
every two hours?

16:40.675 --> 16:45.044
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

16:45.113 --> 16:47.047
I don't know why, but I did. And...

16:47.115 --> 16:48.605
What? What's going on?

16:48.683 --> 16:50.480
It's Marty. He's gone.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.214
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

16:53.288 --> 16:55.950
How long has he been working on this?

16:56.024 --> 16:57.286
Marty!

16:57.359 --> 16:58.724
Marty!

16:58.794 --> 17:00.523
He wouldn't fit down there.

17:00.595 --> 17:02.358
Marty? Marty! Marty!

17:02.430 --> 17:05.022
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

17:07.001 --> 17:09.595
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

17:09.670 --> 17:12.638
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

17:12.705 --> 17:15.196
I mean, we got to call somebody!

17:19.480 --> 17:21.914
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

17:21.982 --> 17:25.713
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

17:28.621 --> 17:30.885
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

17:30.957 --> 17:33.448
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

17:35.461 --> 17:36.655
They'll be really mad.

17:36.729 --> 17:40.426
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.933
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

17:42.001 --> 17:44.561
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

17:44.637 --> 17:47.606
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

17:47.674 --> 17:52.804
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

17:54.246 --> 17:55.474
Poor little guy.

18:17.568 --> 18:18.626
Come on.

18:18.703 --> 18:21.171
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

18:21.239 --> 18:24.470
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.703
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

18:26.777 --> 18:28.802
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

18:28.880 --> 18:32.441
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

18:32.516 --> 18:35.110
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

18:36.386 --> 18:40.117
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

18:41.825 --> 18:44.988
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

18:53.703 --> 18:55.034
We should've taken Park.

18:55.105 --> 18:58.233
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.400
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

19:00.476 --> 19:02.034
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

19:02.111 --> 19:05.842
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

19:05.915 --> 19:07.610
Free mints!

19:07.683 --> 19:09.116
This isn't a field trip.

19:09.184 --> 19:12.711
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

19:12.788 --> 19:14.278
Now, where's the train?

19:14.823 --> 19:16.051
Here it comes.

19:19.628 --> 19:22.994
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

19:23.064 --> 19:26.625
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

19:26.701 --> 19:29.693
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

19:29.771 --> 19:33.571
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

19:39.013 --> 19:42.380
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.645
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

19:44.719 --> 19:47.983
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

19:48.055 --> 19:49.579
Thanks a lot, officer.

19:51.325 --> 19:53.793
Hey! Wait for the light.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.885
Freak.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.693
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.198
Right in front of me.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.791
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

20:02.336 --> 20:04.463
Then I'm going to need some backup.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.348
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.876
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

20:22.955 --> 20:23.944
This is it.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.459
Grand Central Station.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.963
It's grand and it's central.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.540
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

20:53.618 --> 20:57.485
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

20:57.554 --> 20:58.987
Upstairs, downstairs.

20:59.656 --> 21:00.987
How do you like that?

21:03.394 --> 21:05.726
Lady! What is wrong with you?

21:06.397 --> 21:08.888
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

21:08.966 --> 21:10.456
You're a bad kitty.

21:12.236 --> 21:15.171
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

21:15.239 --> 21:18.140
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.970
I got him! I've got him!

21:20.043 --> 21:21.135
He's got him!

21:21.210 --> 21:23.440
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

21:23.513 --> 21:24.946
I got something for you!

21:28.785 --> 21:30.047
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:30.119 --> 21:32.587
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

21:32.655 --> 21:36.421
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

21:36.492 --> 21:39.893
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

21:39.962 --> 21:43.021
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

21:43.098 --> 21:45.828
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

21:45.901 --> 21:47.528
Because I was wondering...

21:47.602 --> 21:50.662
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

21:50.739 --> 21:53.003
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

21:53.075 --> 21:55.202
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

21:55.277 --> 21:58.007
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.945
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

22:00.015 --> 22:03.451
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

22:03.785 --> 22:04.979
Come here.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.855
We've been ratted out, boys.

22:13.928 --> 22:15.452
Hold your fire!

22:21.802 --> 22:24.498
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.808
If you have any poo, fling it now.

22:33.146 --> 22:35.046
It's the Man.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.243
Good evening, officers.

22:38.318 --> 22:40.479
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

22:40.553 --> 22:43.113
You're not good with the
"putting words together

22:43.189 --> 22:45.919
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

22:45.992 --> 22:49.484
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

22:49.562 --> 22:53.429
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

22:53.499 --> 22:56.468
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

22:56.535 --> 22:59.595
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.605
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

23:01.673 --> 23:05.541
Just shush! I will handle this.

23:05.611 --> 23:06.873
Oh! I got him!

23:06.945 --> 23:08.879
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

23:08.947 --> 23:11.040
Would you give a guy a break?

23:12.584 --> 23:16.713
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

23:17.822 --> 23:20.188
No harm, no foul, right?

23:20.258 --> 23:24.661
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.000
What's the matter with them?

23:40.677 --> 23:44.340
I feel really, really weird.

23:46.416 --> 23:47.883
I love you guys.

23:48.885 --> 23:51.683
I love you so much.

24:12.274 --> 24:15.175
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

24:15.243 --> 24:19.111
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

24:19.180 --> 24:22.206
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

24:22.284 --> 24:25.276
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

24:25.353 --> 24:28.844
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

24:28.923 --> 24:31.915
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

24:32.326 --> 24:33.816
Do something!

24:34.595 --> 24:36.392
Oh, man.

24:48.275 --> 24:49.798
Oh, my head.

24:52.412 --> 24:53.777
What the...?

24:53.846 --> 24:56.280
Wait. Where? What?

24:57.083 --> 25:00.780
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

25:00.853 --> 25:04.448
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

25:04.524 --> 25:07.516
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.561
Darkness creeping in.

25:09.629 --> 25:11.893
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

25:11.965 --> 25:14.091
Walls closing in around me.

25:15.367 --> 25:17.460
So alone. So alone.

25:17.536 --> 25:20.471
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

25:20.539 --> 25:23.804
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

25:23.875 --> 25:26.708
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

25:26.778 --> 25:28.837
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

25:28.914 --> 25:32.042
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

25:32.117 --> 25:34.381
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

25:34.453 --> 25:35.579
Oh, no!

25:36.420 --> 25:39.287
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

25:39.357 --> 25:40.449
Is that Melman?

25:40.524 --> 25:43.254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

25:43.327 --> 25:46.160
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

25:46.230 --> 25:49.063
- You're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

25:49.133 --> 25:52.000
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

25:52.069 --> 25:55.527
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

25:55.606 --> 25:58.200
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

25:58.275 --> 26:00.936
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

26:01.011 --> 26:03.605
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.272
And I am not going HMO.

26:05.348 --> 26:08.112
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

26:08.184 --> 26:12.780
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

26:12.856 --> 26:14.983
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

26:15.058 --> 26:18.585
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

26:18.661 --> 26:22.062
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

26:22.132 --> 26:24.656
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

26:24.733 --> 26:29.261
"I don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.569
I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

26:32.641 --> 26:34.302
He does have a point.

26:34.376 --> 26:37.470
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

26:37.546 --> 26:38.672
Melman, just shut it.

26:38.747 --> 26:41.409
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

26:41.483 --> 26:43.951
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

26:44.119 --> 26:46.882
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

26:46.954 --> 26:49.718
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

26:49.791 --> 26:53.625
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.459
Progress report.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.698
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

27:03.771 --> 27:05.898
You, higher mammal.

27:05.973 --> 27:07.406
Can you read?

27:07.475 --> 27:10.637
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

27:14.281 --> 27:17.944
Ship to Kenya.

27:18.018 --> 27:20.680
Wildlife preserve.

27:20.754 --> 27:21.846
Africa!

27:21.922 --> 27:25.085
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

28:07.665 --> 28:10.327
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

28:10.401 --> 28:12.869
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

28:12.937 --> 28:15.633
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

28:15.707 --> 28:16.799
"Loved"?

28:16.875 --> 28:21.106
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

28:21.178 --> 28:24.238
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

28:24.314 --> 28:25.804
I thought I knew the real you!

28:25.883 --> 28:30.786
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

28:30.854 --> 28:32.481
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

28:32.556 --> 28:34.683
You're not helping the situation.

28:35.259 --> 28:36.521
Status.

28:36.593 --> 28:39.824
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

28:39.897 --> 28:43.627
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

28:46.969 --> 28:49.369
All right. Let me think.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.065
And shut him up!

28:54.210 --> 28:57.543
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

29:24.072 --> 29:25.266
Guys?

29:26.341 --> 29:27.433
Oh, no.

29:27.609 --> 29:28.769
Gloria!

29:28.944 --> 29:30.103
Melman!

29:30.277 --> 29:31.335
Marty!

29:32.813 --> 29:34.075
Alex!

29:34.615 --> 29:35.673
Marty?!

29:36.317 --> 29:38.478
Alex!

29:38.552 --> 29:39.849
Marty!

29:39.920 --> 29:42.889
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

29:43.490 --> 29:44.957
Don't go.

30:30.736 --> 30:32.169
Marty?

30:33.272 --> 30:34.705
Melman?

30:35.974 --> 30:37.339
Gloria?

30:41.178 --> 30:42.406
Marty?!

30:42.480 --> 30:43.742
Melman?!

30:43.814 --> 30:45.338
Gloria?!

30:47.618 --> 30:48.607
Marty!

30:50.288 --> 30:52.756
Melman! Gloria!

30:54.058 --> 30:56.549
Hey, anyone! Hello!

31:00.498 --> 31:04.058
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

31:04.701 --> 31:08.193
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

31:08.271 --> 31:10.796
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

31:10.874 --> 31:12.774
Matt, Katie, Al.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.511
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

31:21.017 --> 31:23.645
Get me out of this thing right now!

31:24.154 --> 31:26.212
Hello? Somebody?

31:26.288 --> 31:27.550
Melman!

31:27.623 --> 31:29.488
Alex? Is that you?

31:29.558 --> 31:33.585
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.364
Melman! I got you, buddy.

31:47.042 --> 31:49.601
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

31:50.144 --> 31:53.079
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

31:54.582 --> 31:56.743
- Relax.
- Alex?

31:57.752 --> 32:00.346
Giraffe, corner pocket!

32:01.222 --> 32:02.655
Here goes nothing!

32:02.724 --> 32:04.851
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

32:04.926 --> 32:06.518
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

32:06.594 --> 32:08.653
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

32:08.730 --> 32:10.595
Look! Look! Look! Look!

32:10.665 --> 32:13.758
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

32:15.035 --> 32:17.162
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

32:17.237 --> 32:18.329
Oh, my...

32:18.405 --> 32:19.804
Gloria!

32:29.082 --> 32:30.071
Gloria!

32:34.821 --> 32:36.811
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

32:36.889 --> 32:37.981
Gloria!

32:38.057 --> 32:39.524
Alex!

32:42.328 --> 32:43.886
- Marty?!
- Marty!

32:43.963 --> 32:48.161
Yeah! All right! That's right!

32:48.234 --> 32:52.193
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

32:53.406 --> 32:54.873
Right here's good.

32:55.641 --> 32:59.008
I don't have anything on me
right now. I'll have to get you later.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.348
To you too.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.010
Marty!

33:08.086 --> 33:09.417
Marty!

33:12.123 --> 33:13.613
Alex!

33:16.227 --> 33:18.058
Marty!

33:18.129 --> 33:19.687
Alex!

33:19.764 --> 33:21.095
Marty!

33:21.166 --> 33:22.428
Al!

33:22.500 --> 33:24.831
Marty!

33:24.902 --> 33:26.995
Alex?

33:27.070 --> 33:28.560
Marty!

33:30.574 --> 33:32.872
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

33:32.943 --> 33:34.001
Martin!

33:34.077 --> 33:35.806
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

33:35.879 --> 33:38.780
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

33:38.849 --> 33:41.875
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

33:42.820 --> 33:44.344
Oh, look at us.

33:44.421 --> 33:47.787
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

33:47.857 --> 33:49.848
Yeah, here we are.

33:50.927 --> 33:53.794
Where exactly is "here"?

34:06.609 --> 34:08.132
San Diego.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.768
San Diego?

34:09.844 --> 34:11.402
White sandy beaches,

34:11.480 --> 34:15.643
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

34:15.717 --> 34:18.777
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

34:18.853 --> 34:20.981
Complete with fake rocks.

34:21.056 --> 34:22.819
Wow, that looks real.

34:22.891 --> 34:27.123
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

34:27.195 --> 34:30.322
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

34:30.398 --> 34:33.560
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

34:33.634 --> 34:35.295
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

34:35.369 --> 34:36.996
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

34:37.071 --> 34:40.165
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

34:40.241 --> 34:43.108
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

34:43.177 --> 34:45.645
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

34:45.713 --> 34:50.275
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

34:51.552 --> 34:54.043
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

34:54.121 --> 34:58.079
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

34:58.157 --> 35:00.182
I can't top that. Can't top it.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.821
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

35:03.897 --> 35:07.128
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.862
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

35:09.936 --> 35:12.268
I intended all of this to happen?

35:12.338 --> 35:15.273
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

35:15.341 --> 35:16.330
Okay, I'm...

35:17.577 --> 35:19.010
He just shushed me.

35:19.078 --> 35:22.205
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

35:22.781 --> 35:26.683
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

35:29.555 --> 35:32.490
- I hear it now.
- Where there's music, there's people.

35:32.558 --> 35:35.152
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

35:35.227 --> 35:36.785
Yeah, what a dump.

35:36.862 --> 35:39.126
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

35:39.197 --> 35:44.395
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

35:44.468 --> 35:48.063
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

35:48.139 --> 35:51.506
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

35:59.250 --> 36:00.581
What the...?

36:10.460 --> 36:11.449
Oh, no!

36:18.602 --> 36:21.799
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

36:21.871 --> 36:24.863
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

36:24.941 --> 36:28.433
- Is that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

36:28.511 --> 36:30.808
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

36:37.319 --> 36:41.153
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

36:41.223 --> 36:43.589
California animals. Dude.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.422
This is like a Puffy party.

36:46.195 --> 36:49.687
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

36:49.765 --> 36:51.756
- Ya like to
- Move it

36:51.834 --> 36:55.325
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

36:55.403 --> 36:57.166
I like to move it, move it

36:57.238 --> 36:59.229
- Ya like to
- Move it

36:59.307 --> 37:02.674
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

37:02.744 --> 37:04.473
She like to move it, move it

37:04.545 --> 37:06.069
- He like to
- Move it

37:06.147 --> 37:08.741
All girls all over the world

37:08.816 --> 37:12.081
Original King Julien
'pon yer case, man

37:12.153 --> 37:15.554
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

37:15.623 --> 37:17.613
When ya move your body, ya do

37:17.691 --> 37:20.922
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

37:20.994 --> 37:22.427
What kind of zoo is this?

37:22.496 --> 37:25.863
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

37:25.932 --> 37:28.992
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

37:29.069 --> 37:30.127
Twenty-seven.

37:31.638 --> 37:33.697
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

37:33.774 --> 37:37.676
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

37:37.744 --> 37:40.007
We should've brought chips and dip.

37:40.079 --> 37:41.307
Wait.

37:41.380 --> 37:45.180
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

37:45.251 --> 37:48.584
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

37:48.654 --> 37:50.349
The fossa!

37:50.423 --> 37:51.822
The fossa!

37:51.891 --> 37:54.621
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

38:01.634 --> 38:04.363
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

38:06.271 --> 38:08.432
I hate spiderwebs.

38:08.506 --> 38:10.440
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

38:10.508 --> 38:13.705
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

38:16.681 --> 38:20.617
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

38:20.685 --> 38:24.018
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

38:24.089 --> 38:26.522
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

38:26.590 --> 38:29.957
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

38:30.027 --> 38:33.155
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

38:33.230 --> 38:37.098
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

38:37.167 --> 38:38.156
Well, howdy-do.

38:45.342 --> 38:47.742
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

38:47.811 --> 38:50.904
Maurice, did you see that?

38:50.980 --> 38:53.210
He scared the fossa away.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.351
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

38:57.186 --> 38:59.313
Get it! Get it! Get it!

38:59.388 --> 39:02.016
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

39:02.091 --> 39:04.252
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

39:04.327 --> 39:08.525
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

39:08.598 --> 39:13.557
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

39:13.635 --> 39:18.095
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.873
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

39:24.045 --> 39:27.481
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

39:27.549 --> 39:29.278
Who's making that noise?

39:29.351 --> 39:30.545
Oh, it's me again.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.849
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

39:32.921 --> 39:36.219
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.724
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.957
It's okay. It's gone.

39:41.028 --> 39:43.588
They are savages.

39:43.664 --> 39:44.892
Tonight we die.

39:44.965 --> 39:48.059
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

39:48.135 --> 39:50.035
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

39:50.671 --> 39:53.265
He did tell you about the feet.

39:54.708 --> 39:57.768
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

39:57.845 --> 40:00.210
I have devised a cunning test

40:00.280 --> 40:04.011
to see whether
these are savage killers.

40:09.823 --> 40:11.586
Hi there.

40:11.658 --> 40:16.152
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

40:20.466 --> 40:21.990
Hi there.

40:25.838 --> 40:28.136
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

40:28.207 --> 40:32.371
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

40:32.444 --> 40:36.107
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

40:39.718 --> 40:42.312
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

40:42.387 --> 40:45.015
Did that big mean lion scare you?

40:45.090 --> 40:49.526
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

40:49.594 --> 40:52.757
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

40:52.830 --> 40:55.128
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

40:55.199 --> 40:59.636
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

40:59.704 --> 41:02.605
They're just a bunch of pansies.

41:02.673 --> 41:04.004
I don't know.

41:04.075 --> 41:06.976
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

41:07.044 --> 41:09.170
that I find suspicious.

41:09.246 --> 41:10.804
Nonsense, Maurice.

41:10.881 --> 41:14.942
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

41:26.529 --> 41:30.124
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien Xlll,

41:30.200 --> 41:33.828
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

41:40.709 --> 41:42.199
He's got style.

41:49.051 --> 41:51.542
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

41:53.555 --> 41:55.022
I think it's a squirrel.

41:55.090 --> 41:58.252
Welcome, giant pansies.

41:58.326 --> 42:01.090
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

42:01.162 --> 42:03.596
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

42:03.665 --> 42:07.999
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

42:08.069 --> 42:10.128
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

42:10.271 --> 42:14.207
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

42:14.275 --> 42:16.209
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

42:16.277 --> 42:19.268
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

42:19.346 --> 42:21.473
What big teeth you have. Man!

42:21.548 --> 42:25.814
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

42:26.420 --> 42:28.945
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

42:29.022 --> 42:33.118
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

42:33.193 --> 42:36.458
And just where are you giants from?

42:36.530 --> 42:38.623
We're from New York and...

42:39.199 --> 42:41.394
All hail the New York giants!

42:41.468 --> 42:43.731
New York giants!

42:46.005 --> 42:48.269
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

42:48.341 --> 42:51.435
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

42:51.510 --> 42:54.843
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

42:55.414 --> 42:57.974
Hey, the bozos have the people.

42:58.050 --> 43:01.577
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

43:01.654 --> 43:03.087
They're up there.

43:06.791 --> 43:10.955
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

43:11.029 --> 43:12.121
Wow.

43:12.197 --> 43:14.961
So do you have any live people?

43:16.001 --> 43:17.832
No. Only dead ones.

43:17.902 --> 43:20.871
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

43:20.939 --> 43:24.500
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

43:24.576 --> 43:25.873
The wild?

43:25.944 --> 43:29.038
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

43:29.114 --> 43:30.444
You mean, like,

43:30.614 --> 43:35.108
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

43:35.185 --> 43:37.779
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

43:37.855 --> 43:39.584
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

43:39.656 --> 43:41.590
Oy vey!

43:41.658 --> 43:44.024
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

43:48.432 --> 43:51.697
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

43:51.935 --> 43:54.630
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

43:54.704 --> 43:56.831
I'm swimming back to New York.

43:56.906 --> 43:59.898
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

43:59.976 --> 44:03.537
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

44:03.613 --> 44:08.448
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

44:10.153 --> 44:12.053
I can see!

44:13.056 --> 44:16.354
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

44:16.425 --> 44:18.985
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

44:19.061 --> 44:23.259
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

44:23.331 --> 44:24.457
Yeah, right.

44:24.533 --> 44:28.560
I don't know the words
But we're born free

44:28.637 --> 44:32.198
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

44:38.513 --> 44:43.074
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.553
Rico.

44:50.291 --> 44:54.352
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

44:54.428 --> 44:56.726
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

44:56.797 --> 45:00.164
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

45:00.234 --> 45:04.431
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

45:05.772 --> 45:06.932
Sorry, Alex.

45:07.006 --> 45:11.670
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

45:11.744 --> 45:13.644
No, it's not a latrine.

45:13.713 --> 45:17.979
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

45:18.051 --> 45:19.382
Aw, come on.

45:19.452 --> 45:22.888
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

45:22.956 --> 45:25.220
This could be the best that's happened.

45:25.291 --> 45:27.315
No. No. No. No.

45:27.392 --> 45:31.886
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

45:31.964 --> 45:35.866
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

45:35.934 --> 45:38.528
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

45:38.604 --> 45:41.232
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

45:41.306 --> 45:44.798
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

45:44.877 --> 45:48.540
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

45:48.614 --> 45:51.446
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.984
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

45:54.051 --> 45:56.576
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

45:56.654 --> 46:01.591
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

46:01.659 --> 46:04.355
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

46:04.428 --> 46:07.920
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

46:07.999 --> 46:11.958
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.799
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

46:14.871 --> 46:16.634
You know what? This isn't good.

46:16.706 --> 46:21.040
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.978
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

46:24.047 --> 46:27.983
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

46:28.051 --> 46:29.575
This is the fun side,

46:29.653 --> 46:32.952
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

46:33.023 --> 46:35.753
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

46:35.824 --> 46:39.351
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

46:39.428 --> 46:41.658
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

46:41.730 --> 46:44.164
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

46:46.402 --> 46:50.395
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

46:53.809 --> 46:57.301
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

47:06.788 --> 47:08.449
Shut up, Spalding.

47:13.561 --> 47:16.621
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

47:16.698 --> 47:19.360
How long do I have
to pose like this?

47:20.134 --> 47:22.567
She is finito.

47:23.403 --> 47:27.271
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

47:27.341 --> 47:29.400
to miss this baby.

47:29.476 --> 47:33.674
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

47:33.747 --> 47:37.478
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

47:37.551 --> 47:40.543
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

47:40.621 --> 47:43.647
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

47:43.724 --> 47:45.214
I heard that.

47:45.292 --> 47:47.885
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

47:49.195 --> 47:53.188
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

47:53.266 --> 47:56.133
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

47:56.202 --> 48:00.798
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

48:02.174 --> 48:03.266
Fire.

48:04.477 --> 48:05.466
Fire.

48:07.046 --> 48:09.206
Fire! Fire!

48:13.184 --> 48:14.344
Oh, my

48:14.919 --> 48:16.011
Fire!

48:16.087 --> 48:17.952
Not yet! No, no! No!

48:18.023 --> 48:19.513
Fire!

48:19.591 --> 48:21.024
Melman, hold still!

48:21.960 --> 48:23.757
Jump! Alex, jump!

48:23.828 --> 48:26.092
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

48:27.098 --> 48:29.965
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

48:38.642 --> 48:40.542
You maniac!

48:40.978 --> 48:43.105
You burned it up!

48:43.614 --> 48:45.445
Darn you!

48:45.516 --> 48:48.383
Darn you all to heck!

48:48.786 --> 48:50.947
Can we go to the fun side now?

48:52.256 --> 48:55.350
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

48:55.426 --> 48:58.223
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

48:58.294 --> 49:00.762
Separate those two,
would you, please?

49:00.830 --> 49:02.593
You here, you there. Everyone...

49:03.266 --> 49:06.167
Calm down, people, okay?

49:06.235 --> 49:10.501
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

49:10.573 --> 49:13.736
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

49:13.810 --> 49:15.402
Now, everybody,

49:15.478 --> 49:20.176
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

49:20.248 --> 49:22.148
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

49:22.217 --> 49:26.176
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

49:26.254 --> 49:30.020
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.356
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

49:33.495 --> 49:36.726
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

49:36.798 --> 49:41.599
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

49:41.670 --> 49:44.365
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

49:47.842 --> 49:50.333
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

49:50.411 --> 49:52.038
Please. Maurice.

49:53.114 --> 49:54.877
Quiet!

49:54.949 --> 49:59.113
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

50:00.688 --> 50:04.021
So my genius plan is this:

50:04.091 --> 50:06.490
We will make the New York giants

50:06.559 --> 50:09.460
our friends and keep them close.

50:09.529 --> 50:12.828
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

50:12.899 --> 50:16.266
we will be safe
and never have to worry

50:16.336 --> 50:20.136
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

50:22.475 --> 50:26.468
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

50:26.546 --> 50:29.275
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

50:29.348 --> 50:32.181
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

50:32.251 --> 50:34.845
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

50:34.920 --> 50:38.185
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

50:38.257 --> 50:41.317
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

50:42.761 --> 50:46.026
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

50:46.098 --> 50:48.589
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

50:48.667 --> 50:52.397
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

50:54.105 --> 50:56.869
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

50:56.941 --> 50:59.409
No? Good. So shut up.

50:59.911 --> 51:02.709
When the New York giants wake up,

51:02.780 --> 51:08.446
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

51:09.821 --> 51:12.119
Now, who would like a cookie?

51:36.746 --> 51:41.614
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

51:41.684 --> 51:44.244
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.947
No, thanks.

51:46.021 --> 51:50.185
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

51:50.259 --> 51:53.251
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

51:53.329 --> 51:56.787
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

51:56.866 --> 51:58.766
I just want to go home.

51:59.935 --> 52:03.927
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

52:04.839 --> 52:07.740
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.185
I know. And then...

52:28.161 --> 52:30.254
- It's him.
- Who is it?

52:30.764 --> 52:34.063
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

52:34.401 --> 52:36.767
Yes? Can I help you?

52:37.471 --> 52:38.995
Can I come to the fun side?

52:41.675 --> 52:42.733
Beg your pardon?

52:43.510 --> 52:45.740
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

52:47.681 --> 52:52.413
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

52:59.692 --> 53:03.355
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

53:03.429 --> 53:05.397
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

53:10.469 --> 53:14.564
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

53:21.479 --> 53:22.969
Very impressive.

53:23.048 --> 53:26.108
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

53:27.886 --> 53:29.148
This is seawater.

53:30.255 --> 53:34.055
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

53:34.125 --> 53:36.058
Hey, y'all look hungry.

53:36.794 --> 53:39.820
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

53:40.931 --> 53:42.592
You have food?

53:42.666 --> 53:45.601
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

53:46.303 --> 53:48.328
Seaweed on a stick.

53:48.906 --> 53:49.895
Seaweed?

53:50.341 --> 53:53.401
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

54:01.250 --> 54:02.808
That's unbelievable.

54:04.287 --> 54:06.346
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

54:06.422 --> 54:09.289
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

54:10.293 --> 54:13.524
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

54:17.500 --> 54:21.800
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

54:21.871 --> 54:23.633
Oh, but it does.

54:24.306 --> 54:25.830
Check this out.

54:31.146 --> 54:35.105
Wow. Would you look at that.

54:35.183 --> 54:39.677
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

54:39.755 --> 54:42.155
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

54:42.224 --> 54:45.387
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

54:45.460 --> 54:46.983
You know what, Alex?

54:47.061 --> 54:51.725
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

54:51.799 --> 54:53.096
Thanks, Marty.

54:53.167 --> 54:56.227
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

54:56.303 --> 54:58.737
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

54:58.806 --> 55:00.671
Sweet dreams, everyone.

55:30.970 --> 55:32.368
Alex.

55:42.347 --> 55:44.076
What are you doing?

55:44.917 --> 55:49.411
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

55:49.488 --> 55:52.321
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

55:52.391 --> 55:53.915
Dilemma solved. Good night.

56:04.635 --> 56:08.162
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

56:08.239 --> 56:11.675
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.678
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

56:14.746 --> 56:18.409
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

56:18.483 --> 56:21.007
I don't think he was grooming him.

56:21.084 --> 56:23.552
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

56:23.620 --> 56:26.953
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

56:27.023 --> 56:31.187
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

56:31.261 --> 56:33.991
All we have to do is wait

56:34.064 --> 56:37.727
until they are deep in their sleep.

56:43.405 --> 56:46.340
How long is this going to take?!

57:12.767 --> 57:14.200
Well, this sucks!

57:15.370 --> 57:18.134
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

57:19.274 --> 57:21.799
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

57:22.410 --> 57:24.207
Rise and shining.

57:24.279 --> 57:27.476
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

57:27.549 --> 57:29.015
Wake up! Alex!

57:29.550 --> 57:30.778
You suck your thumb?

57:33.821 --> 57:36.415
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

57:36.490 --> 57:38.754
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

57:38.826 --> 57:41.818
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

57:41.895 --> 57:43.089
While you were asleep,

57:43.163 --> 57:47.327
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

57:47.401 --> 57:49.665
Welcome to Madagascar.

57:49.736 --> 57:52.296
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

57:52.371 --> 57:54.737
No, not whooha. Ascar.

58:02.381 --> 58:04.076
Marty. It's...

58:04.150 --> 58:06.710
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

58:06.786 --> 58:10.950
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

58:11.023 --> 58:13.082
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

58:13.159 --> 58:17.060
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

58:17.195 --> 58:20.596
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

58:20.765 --> 58:24.098
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

58:24.169 --> 58:25.568
Who's with me?!

58:25.637 --> 58:28.105
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

58:28.173 --> 58:29.765
Hey! Want to play around?

58:32.010 --> 58:33.204
Got you there!

58:33.278 --> 58:34.643
Come here!

58:35.013 --> 58:36.207
You're it.

58:36.281 --> 58:39.010
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

58:39.617 --> 58:42.177
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

58:42.253 --> 58:44.744
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

58:44.822 --> 58:47.313
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

58:47.391 --> 58:49.291
I haven't eaten in two days.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.488
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.428
I don't think that's your problem.

58:54.498 --> 58:57.194
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

58:57.268 --> 58:59.236
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

58:59.303 --> 59:01.294
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

59:01.372 --> 59:04.807
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

59:04.874 --> 59:08.037
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

59:08.111 --> 59:10.909
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.572
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

59:12.649 --> 59:14.241
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

59:14.317 --> 59:17.912
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

59:17.987 --> 59:22.117
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

59:23.459 --> 59:25.256
I'm the cat!

59:31.066 --> 59:32.533
Surprise!

59:40.042 --> 59:41.566
You're it. You're it!

59:41.643 --> 59:43.941
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

59:46.915 --> 59:52.250
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

59:53.254 --> 59:56.280
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

01:00:03.431 --> 01:00:06.127
Man! I feel different.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.499
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:13.132
Kind of charged up or something.

01:00:13.206 --> 01:00:16.004
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

01:00:16.076 --> 01:00:20.513
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:00:23.216 --> 01:00:24.774
I'm in heaven.

01:00:24.851 --> 01:00:29.788
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

01:00:29.856 --> 01:00:32.757
It could be said
that my plan is working

01:00:32.826 --> 01:00:36.124
in a very good working kind of way.

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:39.323
Alex. You got to try some of this.

01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:43.434
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:45.429
King?

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:48.035
You should see his act.

01:00:48.107 --> 01:00:51.304
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

01:00:51.377 --> 01:00:54.278
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:57.611
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

01:00:57.683 --> 01:00:59.809
The wild proudly presents:

01:00:59.884 --> 01:01:01.351
The king.

01:01:01.419 --> 01:01:04.217
Alex the lion!

01:01:05.223 --> 01:01:06.485
E flat, fellas.

01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:18.663
Yeah! The king is in the house!

01:01:18.736 --> 01:01:22.603
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

01:01:22.672 --> 01:01:25.800
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:27.844
Look at it. Have I got it on?

01:01:34.117 --> 01:01:36.142
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:44.624
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

01:01:44.694 --> 01:01:46.923
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

01:01:48.464 --> 01:01:49.692
Break out the wave!

01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:18.752
Excuse me.

01:02:18.827 --> 01:02:21.057
You're biting my butt.

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:25.832
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:02:27.735 --> 01:02:29.828
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

01:02:29.904 --> 01:02:32.065
No. I didn't. Did I?

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.697
You kind of did.

01:02:33.774 --> 01:02:35.901
What the heck is wrong with you?

01:02:37.644 --> 01:02:38.906
Why'd you bite me?

01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:41.777
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

01:02:41.849 --> 01:02:44.113
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

01:02:44.184 --> 01:02:48.644
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

01:02:48.722 --> 01:02:50.587
Here, give me a nibble.

01:02:50.657 --> 01:02:54.354
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

01:02:54.428 --> 01:02:56.190
What are you talking about?

01:02:56.262 --> 01:02:57.957
Your friend here is what we call

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:01.193
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

01:03:01.267 --> 01:03:03.201
And he eats steak...

01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:04.736
...which is you.

01:03:04.804 --> 01:03:09.002
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

01:03:09.075 --> 01:03:10.906
The plan failed.

01:03:10.977 --> 01:03:14.242
All is lost! We're all doomed.

01:03:14.313 --> 01:03:19.113
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

01:03:19.184 --> 01:03:21.550
...we are all steak.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.485
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

01:03:23.555 --> 01:03:25.785
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

01:03:25.857 --> 01:03:30.191
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

01:03:30.262 --> 01:03:32.162
By the power vested in me,

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.529
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.760
Be gone!

01:03:36.835 --> 01:03:39.668
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

01:03:39.738 --> 01:03:40.966
Yeah!

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:43.939
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

01:03:44.008 --> 01:03:46.408
Oh, yeah!

01:03:47.912 --> 01:03:51.507
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

01:03:53.517 --> 01:03:55.178
Marty, run!

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.704
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

01:04:15.772 --> 01:04:16.864
Thank you.

01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:23.507
Marty?

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.849
I'm so sorry, Marty.

01:04:32.354 --> 01:04:35.118
What is wrong with me?

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:37.522
Ow.

01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:39.390
Oh, no.

01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:41.122
What have I done?

01:04:41.196 --> 01:04:44.290
It's true. I'm a monster.

01:04:44.366 --> 01:04:46.334
I got to get out of here.

01:06:57.927 --> 01:07:01.294
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

01:07:01.364 --> 01:07:03.093
And it's all my fault.

01:07:03.165 --> 01:07:06.134
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:07.863
Well, what are we going to do?

01:07:07.937 --> 01:07:10.599
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

01:07:10.673 --> 01:07:11.662
Okay.

01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:14.470
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:16.806
We're tough.
We're gritty.

01:07:16.878 --> 01:07:18.607
We're adaptable!

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.615
And we are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:24.151
No, we're not.

01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:25.481
Oh. Gloria.

01:07:25.553 --> 01:07:28.681
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

01:07:28.823 --> 01:07:30.950
- The boat!
- The boat?

01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:35.018
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

01:07:37.164 --> 01:07:38.153
There it is!

01:07:38.232 --> 01:07:40.166
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:41.701
Over here! Yo!

01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:44.465
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:45.937
Help! Help! Help!

01:07:46.006 --> 01:07:48.839
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

01:07:48.909 --> 01:07:52.640
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

01:07:52.713 --> 01:07:54.578
Hey, boat! We're over here!

01:07:56.817 --> 01:08:00.912
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

01:08:00.987 --> 01:08:03.285
Come on! Come on, baby!

01:08:04.424 --> 01:08:06.119
Yes! You guys.

01:08:06.192 --> 01:08:08.490
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:11.394
Whoa! Hold on there.

01:08:11.464 --> 01:08:13.864
You cannot go back there by yourself.

01:08:13.933 --> 01:08:16.265
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

01:08:16.335 --> 01:08:19.099
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:21.606
The people are coming.
They can help us.

01:08:21.674 --> 01:08:24.665
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

01:08:24.743 --> 01:08:26.973
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

01:08:45.363 --> 01:08:48.024
Now, this is more like it.

01:08:48.098 --> 01:08:51.465
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

01:08:51.535 --> 01:08:53.469
We killed them and ate their livers.

01:08:55.538 --> 01:08:56.836
Got you, didn't I?

01:08:56.907 --> 01:08:59.535
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.941
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:05.379
Hey, I know you two.

01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:09.885
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

01:09:09.953 --> 01:09:13.912
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:17.551
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

01:09:17.627 --> 01:09:20.790
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:22.764
Looks like we have a job to do.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:25.698
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

01:09:25.768 --> 01:09:29.295
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

01:09:29.471 --> 01:09:31.939
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

01:09:32.008 --> 01:09:34.600
We're going to face extreme peril.

01:09:34.676 --> 01:09:37.076
Private probably won't survive.

01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:46.752
Alex! Come out, Alex!

01:09:46.822 --> 01:09:49.120
The boat's here! We can go home!

01:09:55.630 --> 01:10:00.727
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:00.902 --> 01:10:05.498
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.007
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:09.076 --> 01:10:12.807
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.279
Alex!

01:10:16.284 --> 01:10:17.273
Alex!

01:10:19.185 --> 01:10:20.652
Marty?

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.486
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:28.619
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

01:10:28.695 --> 01:10:30.185
Stay back.

01:10:31.197 --> 01:10:32.289
Please.

01:10:33.433 --> 01:10:35.367
I'm a monster.

01:10:35.435 --> 01:10:38.802
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

01:10:38.872 --> 01:10:41.966
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

01:10:49.848 --> 01:10:51.975
I don't want to hurt you.

01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:25.213
Alex.

01:11:25.283 --> 01:11:27.342
I ain't leaving without you.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:46.431
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:50.496
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:55.675
Start spreadin' the news

01:11:56.812 --> 01:12:00.578
I'm leaving today

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:05.280
We are a great big part of it

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:11.983
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.723
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:17.993
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

01:12:21.636 --> 01:12:25.299
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

01:12:25.373 --> 01:12:28.809
Hey, Alex, a little help.

01:12:29.744 --> 01:12:31.075
Help me!

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:34.342
Alex! Help!

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:42.549
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:45.690
Help!

01:12:56.904 --> 01:12:58.496
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

01:13:00.074 --> 01:13:01.405
Run!

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:05.701
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:07.370
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

01:13:07.447 --> 01:13:09.677
This is the plan?

01:13:09.749 --> 01:13:11.046
Fossa halt.

01:13:13.686 --> 01:13:16.120
Fossa ooh.

01:13:16.889 --> 01:13:18.789
Fossa aaahh.

01:13:20.059 --> 01:13:22.459
Fossa ooh.

01:13:23.996 --> 01:13:26.361
Fossa aaahh.

01:13:27.232 --> 01:13:28.995
Come and get it.

01:13:29.067 --> 01:13:30.091
Fossa.

01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:44.715
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

01:13:44.783 --> 01:13:47.217
There's too many of them, skipper.

01:13:47.285 --> 01:13:50.378
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

01:13:56.127 --> 01:13:58.493
Alex?

01:13:58.562 --> 01:13:59.995
That's my kill.

01:14:00.064 --> 01:14:01.429
Mine.

01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:08.832
Alex hungry.

01:14:10.174 --> 01:14:11.698
Alex eat.

01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:29.922
It's showtime.

01:14:32.028 --> 01:14:33.757
Thanks for not giving up on me.

01:14:34.798 --> 01:14:38.699
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.

01:14:38.767 --> 01:14:41.793
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:45.271
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.399
Like I said, it's showtime.

01:14:48.877 --> 01:14:50.071
Mine.

01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:52.777
My kill.

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:56.077
They're all mine.

01:14:58.287 --> 01:15:00.220
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

01:15:00.288 --> 01:15:02.279
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

01:15:02.356 --> 01:15:05.757
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

01:15:05.827 --> 01:15:09.786
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

01:15:09.864 --> 01:15:12.355
- And, you!
- Me?

01:15:16.437 --> 01:15:21.238
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:24.769
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:34.582
This is my territory.
Understand?

01:15:35.722 --> 01:15:39.783
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

01:15:46.498 --> 01:15:47.487
Boo.

01:15:50.402 --> 01:15:52.267
Yeah! You the cat!

01:15:53.772 --> 01:15:55.171
Got my boy back!

01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:58.108
I did it!

01:15:58.177 --> 01:16:02.204
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:05.614
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

01:16:05.684 --> 01:16:07.845
I am very clever king.

01:16:08.621 --> 01:16:10.212
I am super genius.

01:16:10.288 --> 01:16:12.882
I am robot king of the monkey things.

01:16:12.957 --> 01:16:16.484
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

01:16:18.863 --> 01:16:20.797
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

01:16:20.865 --> 01:16:22.332
- Do it.
- They're closed.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.265
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:24.335 --> 01:16:26.064
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

01:16:26.137 --> 01:16:27.900
Rico.

01:16:31.776 --> 01:16:32.833
Hai.

01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:35.705
Open that hatch.

01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:39.172
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

01:16:39.983 --> 01:16:42.577
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.183
- And?
- Well?

01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:47.120
Pretty good, right?

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:49.590
There's always Plan B.

01:16:51.261 --> 01:16:53.195
This is better than steak.

01:16:53.263 --> 01:16:55.026
I love it. I love it!

01:16:55.098 --> 01:16:57.088
The kitty loves the fishy.

01:16:59.869 --> 01:17:02.235
Well, I propose a toast.

01:17:02.305 --> 01:17:05.240
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

01:17:05.308 --> 01:17:07.435
And trust me, I know.

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.206
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

01:17:10.279 --> 01:17:12.713
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

01:17:12.782 --> 01:17:14.579
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:23.448
Enough! Stop it!

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.388
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

01:17:28.463 --> 01:17:30.954
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

01:17:31.032 --> 01:17:33.023
You sure you want to leave?

01:17:33.101 --> 01:17:35.069
I don't care where we are.

01:17:35.136 --> 01:17:38.435
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

01:17:38.506 --> 01:17:40.133
Well, in that case...

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:43.370
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

01:17:43.444 --> 01:17:44.775
Hai.

01:17:44.845 --> 01:17:48.576
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:51.618
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

01:17:51.685 --> 01:17:56.247
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:58.655
I have decided to thank you

01:17:58.726 --> 01:18:01.456
for bringing peace to our home.

01:18:01.528 --> 01:18:03.189
And to make you feel good,

01:18:03.263 --> 01:18:06.095
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

01:18:06.165 --> 01:18:08.998
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

01:18:09.068 --> 01:18:11.559
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

01:18:11.637 --> 01:18:12.934
It's got a gecko on it.

01:18:13.006 --> 01:18:16.203
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

01:18:17.243 --> 01:18:17.310
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:20.074
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

01:18:20.146 --> 01:18:21.636
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

01:18:21.714 --> 01:18:23.306
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

01:18:23.383 --> 01:18:26.045
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:29.212
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

01:18:30.055 --> 01:18:32.319
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:35.758
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

01:18:35.827 --> 01:18:37.852
So I was just thinking, why rush?

01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:40.864
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

01:18:40.932 --> 01:18:43.332
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

01:18:43.402 --> 01:18:45.836
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

01:18:45.904 --> 01:18:48.668
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.605
Cheap meds.

01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:53.370
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

01:18:53.444 --> 01:18:55.776
- I could do that.
- You could say that again.

01:18:55.846 --> 01:18:58.815
- Skipper?
- I always wanted to go to Australia.

01:18:58.883 --> 01:19:02.478
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

01:19:02.553 --> 01:19:03.679
Nah.

01:19:03.754 --> 01:19:07.656
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.104
^*^ THE END ^*^
