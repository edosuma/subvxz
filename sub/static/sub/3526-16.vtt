<i>23, red and odd.</i>

01:48.534 --> 01:50.002
<i>No!
- Yes! Motherfucker!</i>

01:50.069 --> 01:51.938
Fucking nailed it, t!

01:52.004 --> 01:54.707
Jesus, 23. Sophia's
birthday. I shoulda had that.

01:54.774 --> 01:56.442
Got it like five ways there.

01:56.509 --> 01:58.144
Six. He's on red, too.

01:58.211 --> 02:00.947
- You cocksucking motherfucker.
- What happened?

02:01.013 --> 02:03.249
- Tony hit one straight up.
- Finally.

02:03.316 --> 02:05.885
66-10 going out.

02:05.955 --> 02:07.750
Dot you spill those.

02:07.821 --> 02:10.157
- You wanna take it or play it?
- Let's play it.

02:10.223 --> 02:12.951
- All right.
- All right, my man.

02:13.029 --> 02:14.990
23 and all around.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.333
<i>Are you fucking kidding?
- You gotta ride that.</i>

02:19.636 --> 02:21.461
- All right, one more time.
Come on.

02:21.538 --> 02:23.031
<i>Do it again!
Come on.</i>

02:23.105 --> 02:24.402
<i>23.
Come on, come on.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:26.730
<i>Come on, bounce.</i>

02:26.805 --> 02:28.740
<i>Do it again!
Come on, 23.</i>

02:28.805 --> 02:30.971
<i>11.</i>

02:31.047 --> 02:33.273
- Fucking Christ.
- Jeez.

02:33.348 --> 02:36.040
Douchebags are taking
it all back tonight.

02:40.085 --> 02:42.681
What the fuck, Vito?
You almost hit me.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.991
Timber,
motherfucker!

02:56.806 --> 02:58.871
<i>Stop right there!</i>

03:04.578 --> 03:08.383
10:1 odds-- Poor boy's delight
and she fucking comes in.

03:08.448 --> 03:09.842
Oof.

03:09.917 --> 03:12.481
Look at this mezza-Mort.

03:12.556 --> 03:14.722
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

03:14.786 --> 03:17.250
- Sil.
- How are you, baby?

03:17.328 --> 03:19.223
Good to see you.
Hey.

03:19.295 --> 03:21.161
Sit down.

03:21.225 --> 03:23.292
Can I get you something?
A coffee or a bun?

03:25.338 --> 03:27.632
I'll let you two talk.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.463
So.

03:29.536 --> 03:32.000
I really appreciate
you letting me see you.

03:32.076 --> 03:35.840
And you've been so decent about
everything since Vito death.

03:37.078 --> 03:40.880
I just don't know who else--

03:40.947 --> 03:43.613
All right, all right.
Come on, marie.

03:43.686 --> 03:46.353
- What can I do?
- It's little v.

03:46.418 --> 03:49.082
The social worker says
he's just acting out.

03:49.157 --> 03:51.350
- Social worker?
- Boy stf mostly,

03:51.426 --> 03:55.321
But so angry.

03:55.396 --> 03:59.061
Although some of what he's being
accused of is just persecution.

03:59.135 --> 04:02.531
Ey claim that he hung the petruzzo's
cat on their garage door...

04:04.076 --> 04:06.003
...but it's
totally unfounded.

04:06.077 --> 04:07.900
<i>- Well, you know,
in a way,</i>

04:07.978 --> 04:10.201
It's to be expected,
with Vito passing

04:10.278 --> 04:12.171
And all that
that entrailed.

04:12.245 --> 04:14.810
I think the only solution
is to move away

04:14.885 --> 04:17.510
From that house
and the kids at school.

04:19.856 --> 04:21.649
I figured it out,

04:21.725 --> 04:23.750
And I know it's a lot,

04:23.827 --> 04:26.651
But for $100,000,

04:26.728 --> 04:30.563
We can be someplace where no
one knows him or what happened.

04:32.095 --> 04:34.300
My friend cheryl lives
in orono, maine,

04:34.365 --> 04:36.361
By the university.

04:36.437 --> 04:38.733
And there is
this two-Story cape,

04:38.806 --> 04:40.941
With solid schools.

04:41.006 --> 04:44.542
You always said if there's
anything you could do...

04:46.775 --> 04:48.211
sure.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.311
Have you talked
to his uncle?

04:52.388 --> 04:54.150
- Who?
- Phil.

04:54.225 --> 04:57.391
Phil's not his uncle.
Him and I are second cousins.

04:57.457 --> 04:59.850
Before we get
too drastic here

04:59.925 --> 05:02.763
And uproot little Vito
and all of you

05:02.865 --> 05:04.991
From your friends
and your family,

05:05.066 --> 05:08.131
- I should talk to him.
- He's impossible to talk to.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.573
It's not easy
to substitute for a dad.

05:11.635 --> 05:13.803
I know.

05:13.877 --> 05:17.813
But maybe I can
fill in here.

05:20.718 --> 05:22.811
Okay, but you'll
think about it?

05:22.885 --> 05:26.582
Believe me, I'm gonna take care
of you, and he's gonna be okay.

05:29.656 --> 05:31.852
Well...

05:31.957 --> 05:34.660
apparently Vito jr.'S
a whack job.

05:34.725 --> 05:37.661
No surprise there.
Family history?

05:37.738 --> 05:41.261
She wants $100,000
for a change of scenery.

05:41.338 --> 05:43.202
That never works.

05:43.266 --> 05:44.831
She should get him a dog.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.002
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:53.175 --> 05:55.513
The point is how the fuck
is this my problem?

05:55.588 --> 05:58.513
Hmm? Because I'm the boss of the family?

06:00.185 --> 06:01.780
Where the fuck
is Phil Leotardo?

06:01.857 --> 06:05.351
He created the situation
by clipping Vito to begin with.

06:05.425 --> 06:07.722
My best fucking earner.

06:07.797 --> 06:11.562
Now second time around
I'm getting my pocket picked.

06:12.735 --> 06:15.633
Not to mention
he's his uncle

06:15.708 --> 06:17.570
Or cousin
or whatever the fuck.

06:17.637 --> 06:20.071
Not your problem.
I agree.

06:23.607 --> 06:25.312
<i>I agree, jim.</i>

06:25.378 --> 06:27.380
<i>I argued against
the on-Side kick.</i>

06:27.446 --> 06:29.613
<i>Let's face it,
they rarely work.</i>

06:29.687 --> 06:32.250
<i>Yet here they are, the
overworked bucs d falling apart</i>

06:32.286 --> 06:33.853
<i>As the bills,
with that play,</i>

06:33.928 --> 06:35.652
<i>Are inside the 30
and loaded for goal.</i>

06:35.727 --> 06:37.452
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- Just watch.

06:37.557 --> 06:40.050
- Bills get another seven.
- You think?

06:40.126 --> 06:43.393
- Nah, I say a quick field goal wins it.
- Absolutely.

06:43.427 --> 06:46.993
They'll choke. That's what they
do. You got buffalo, right, t?

06:47.067 --> 06:48.900
No, line is three.
I'll settle for a push.

06:48.968 --> 06:51.133
Buffalo!
Fucking go for it!

06:53.506 --> 06:56.042
<i>Third and two, the snap.
Losman's back, he hands it off--</i>

06:56.105 --> 06:58.273
<i>- Fumble! Ball is
with him.</i>

06:58.348 --> 07:00.683
<i>Buffalo recovers.</i>

07:00.745 --> 07:03.713
<i>- No!
- Fumbled again!</i>

07:03.787 --> 07:05.251
Get him!
Come on!

07:05.288 --> 07:06.552
Oho.
Oh, boy.

07:06.615 --> 07:08.252
Get him!

07:10.427 --> 07:13.122
<i>Buffalo scor
as time expires.</i>

07:13.197 --> 07:15.063
Un-Fucking-Believable.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.120
Buffalo!
Fucking-A!

07:18.597 --> 07:21.701
Listen to this fucking guy.
Probably won $35 down there.

07:21.805 --> 07:23.801
<i>Buffalo 28,</i>

07:23.908 --> 07:25.401
<i>Tampa bay 24.</i>

07:25.475 --> 07:28.041
Skip, another beer?

07:30.107 --> 07:33.311
No, I'm gonna
go take a snooze.

08:31.376 --> 08:33.301
Beautiful, sweetheart.

08:34.544 --> 08:37.210
Nancy sinatra,
everybody.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.881
- Congratulations, philly.
- Thank you.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.450
We were gonna go
the festival route,

08:46.606 --> 08:48.922
But I think we found a guy who
wants to distribute it himself,

08:48.985 --> 08:50.751
So, well, we'll see
what happens.

08:50.825 --> 08:52.591
It's a good little movie.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.421
<i>- All right.
- I'll talk to you.</i>

08:55.497 --> 08:58.561
Jesus Christ,
it's 11:30.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.432
Ready to call it?

09:00.496 --> 09:02.602
An hour ago.

09:04.937 --> 09:07.603
I saw him bring dean
and jerry back together.

09:07.675 --> 09:09.643
I was there
at the telethon.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.843
I cried.

09:11.915 --> 09:14.212
You leaving already?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.140
Yeah, it's late.

09:16.217 --> 09:18.911
Got a long hike
to Jersey from here.

09:18.986 --> 09:21.150
Sure, I used
to drive it myself.

09:21.226 --> 09:24.021
No more, though.

09:24.095 --> 09:26.353
I'll be right back.

09:29.028 --> 09:31.433
Congratulations again.

09:31.498 --> 09:34.001
Listeni gotta
bring this up.

09:34.068 --> 09:37.400
- A favor already?
- Excuse me?

09:37.478 --> 09:40.503
Thony, you always have
business on your mind.

09:40.605 --> 09:42.900
Take a night,
smell the cognac.

09:42.978 --> 09:45.172
Marie Spatafore came
to see me.

09:45.246 --> 09:47.170
She wants $100,000
to relocate

09:47.241 --> 09:50.718
On account of Vito jr. Already
has hiown social worker.

09:50.814 --> 09:52.851
Patty told me
there was doings.

09:52.919 --> 09:55.680
I guess the turd doesn't
fall far from the faggot's ass.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.520
That's beautifully put,

09:57.596 --> 10:01.092
But you're family, right?
Cousins?

10:01.167 --> 10:03.362
What can you do?
Throw money at the problem?

10:03.466 --> 10:05.531
Well, somebody's gonna.

10:08.165 --> 10:09.902
I'll talk to the kid,

10:09.966 --> 10:12.802
- Set him right.
- Good.

10:12.876 --> 10:14.301
You two going
home together?

10:18.377 --> 10:20.372
How the fuck are you?

10:20.446 --> 10:22.841
Fucking prostate keeping
me pissing all night.

10:22.918 --> 10:25.280
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

10:28.887 --> 10:30.590
Nu?

10:37.168 --> 10:40.530
I talked to Phil about the
split on the mri centers.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.333
Your cut is on the way.

10:42.406 --> 10:43.971
So is Christmas.

10:44.036 --> 10:46.902
You should have
heard him tonight.

10:46.977 --> 10:49.803
- Comments, smug.
- Really?

10:49.876 --> 10:52.043
Worries me.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.512
I thought we were getting
along pretty good finally,

10:54.588 --> 10:56.613
You know,
considering.

10:56.688 --> 10:58.683
Could be t hubris,
making boss.

10:58.756 --> 11:01.480
But I still think it's what
went down with his brother Billy.

11:01.557 --> 11:03.251
I thought all that
got buried with your cousin.

11:03.327 --> 11:06.192
- Eh.
- You enjoy the dinner?

11:06.257 --> 11:09.063
- I left right after.
- Oh yeah?

11:09.128 --> 11:13.033
I don't know.

11:13.096 --> 11:14.861
I look at my key guys--

11:14.937 --> 11:17.132
Paulie, Christopher,

11:17.208 --> 11:20.202
My brother-In-Law-- What's
number one on their agenda?

11:22.907 --> 11:25.341
They're all fucking murderers,
for Christ's sake.

11:25.417 --> 11:28.541
Lonely at the top,
boychik?

11:28.616 --> 11:30.980
What I'm trying
to say is...

11:31.058 --> 11:33.711
it's nice being here.

11:33.786 --> 11:35.722
Always is.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.260
Oh!

11:41.326 --> 11:43.262
I brought you something.

11:47.635 --> 11:49.602
<i>Cover up that dome.</i>

11:51.477 --> 11:54.672
Actually, I was
expecting something else.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.312
What, the fucking dvd?

11:57.376 --> 11:59.341
Honestly, it's a very
unflattering portrait

11:59.415 --> 12:01.643
Of Italian-Americans.

12:01.716 --> 12:04.950
No, I was thinking maybe some
of the $200,000 I loaned you?

12:05.015 --> 12:08.452
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, that's right.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.092
I know it's covered. It's just
after a while with no vig--

12:11.158 --> 12:13.090
You know,
I lost track.

12:13.155 --> 12:16.122
I'm glad you didn't.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.991
- I don't wanna be a stickler.
- No.

12:18.067 --> 12:20.762
Anthony, come on. No,
it's okay. It's okay.

12:22.368 --> 12:25.272
I got about $3,000 here.
Point and a half good?

12:25.336 --> 12:27.442
- No, come on, fuck this.
- You gotta have it.

12:27.505 --> 12:30.402
- Don't want you eating cat food.
- Come on, stop it.

12:30.475 --> 12:33.271
I don't gotta have it. I
don't want a vig from you.

12:33.345 --> 12:35.083
<i>No, come on.</i>

12:35.145 --> 12:37.283
I should have been on it.

12:40.925 --> 12:44.592
- You sure?
- Jesus Christ, are we good or what?

12:44.656 --> 12:47.291
<i>Well, it's late.</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.322
I should be getting back.

12:49.397 --> 12:52.463
You should get back to
pissing, or whatever.

12:57.035 --> 13:00.371
I lend the guy money.
Suddenly I'm the schmuck.

13:00.438 --> 13:03.401
<i>Why does he need
your money?</i>

13:03.505 --> 13:06.473
Why?
To cover his nut.

13:06.546 --> 13:09.141
Between his gambling
and the lifestyle,

13:09.217 --> 13:11.053
And that boat--

13:11.116 --> 13:13.951
$3.2 mil.
I warned him.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.882
It has absolutely
no resale value whatsoever.

13:16.956 --> 13:18.893
Does he listen?
Heh.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.133
I've lent lots of money.

13:25.197 --> 13:28.003
Once the chiseling starts--
"Ooh, I forgot."

13:28.066 --> 13:30.000
Who forgets?
Fuck him.

13:30.067 --> 13:33.601
This is why I don't like you seeing
him before bed. You're all upset.

13:33.677 --> 13:36.802
Makes a big show
of giving me a vig.

13:36.877 --> 13:40.173
$3,000 a week.

13:48.126 --> 13:49.950
You got a lot of Jews
in your business, right?

13:50.028 --> 13:51.853
My business?

13:51.927 --> 13:54.462
Yeah, this.

13:54.528 --> 13:58.360
You gotta hand it to them,
when it comes to money...

13:58.437 --> 14:00.763
in my experience,

14:00.835 --> 14:04.532
- That's nothing more than an ugly stereotype.
- Really?

14:06.707 --> 14:09.073
I got a friend, let me tell
you, you tie a krugerrand

14:09.147 --> 14:11.642
To a fishing line,
you're gonna land him.

14:11.716 --> 14:13.440
Right up on the dock.

14:13.518 --> 14:16.843
Doesn't sound like you
think of him as a friend.

14:16.915 --> 14:20.411
Come on.
We go way back.

14:22.427 --> 14:25.892
But that didn't stop him from busting my
fucking balls because I owe him some money.

14:29.798 --> 14:32.791
Anyway, I needed
a little bridge loan

14:32.865 --> 14:35.101
To cover some of the gambling
losses we've been talking about.

14:35.165 --> 14:38.333
- Still?
- You know, good money after bad.

14:38.408 --> 14:41.542
- Why not just stop?
- Big part of my life.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.973
I know, but you've been
talking about it a lot.

14:44.046 --> 14:46.270
Well, you lose sometimes.

14:47.918 --> 14:49.813
You gotta act like it hurts
a little more than it does,

14:49.885 --> 14:51.653
Yoknow,
for your guys.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.421
But if you're gonna lose,
what's the fucking point, huh?

14:56.486 --> 14:58.752
So you need the risk.

14:58.827 --> 15:00.763
What are you chasing?

15:00.826 --> 15:03.260
Money or a high
from winning?

15:08.907 --> 15:10.930
Before we end,

15:11.007 --> 15:13.200
There's something
I need to bring up.

15:15.547 --> 15:18.012
You miss a lot
of appointments.

15:18.107 --> 15:21.383
Excuse me, I always give you the
required notice or I pay forhe hour.

15:21.445 --> 15:23.952
- That's not my point.
- Well, I get busy.

15:24.017 --> 15:27.112
It's my fault. I've
condoned it for a long time.

15:27.186 --> 15:30.223
I haven't had
a panic attack

15:30.286 --> 15:32.393
Since my uncle shot me.

15:32.455 --> 15:34.720
- Did you notice that?
- Yes.

15:36.397 --> 15:39.090
Well, it must be nice
to know everything.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.260
Is that the only reason
why you're here?

15:42.336 --> 15:43.763
The panic attacks?

15:43.805 --> 15:45.872
No.

15:48.606 --> 15:50.812
This is an...

15:50.877 --> 15:54.041
oasis in my week.

15:54.116 --> 15:56.312
So this is vacation?

15:56.418 --> 15:59.082
No, I benefit
in many ways.

15:59.155 --> 16:01.783
Decide if you wanna
keep coming,

16:01.857 --> 16:05.120
But know there are protocols
that have to be followed

16:05.198 --> 16:07.762
Or I won't be able
to continue.

16:09.996 --> 16:11.991
Okay, I will.

16:19.636 --> 16:23.240
Now, I know Brian wants
the media room downstairs,

16:23.308 --> 16:26.442
But I think it's better if
the gym has access to the pool.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.683
That's the inspector.

16:29.747 --> 16:31.980
I told the guy to run
cable for computers,

16:32.018 --> 16:34.780
But I can't promise the damn
thing is not already obsolete.

16:34.858 --> 16:37.423
- Hi, how are you?
- Ted yackinelli, yackinelli home inspections.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.720
Yeah, come on in. These are
our cousins, Hugh and Carmela.

16:40.798 --> 16:42.423
- How are you doing?
- They're also the builders.

16:42.498 --> 16:44.463
Ohgreat.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.261
Wanna start over here?

16:46.368 --> 16:48.230
Yeah.

17:06.257 --> 17:08.849
You know, I didn't come out here
just to buy you a couple of sundaes.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.351
It's a silo.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.220
I don't give a fuck
what it is.

17:13.295 --> 17:15.290
What the hell
is wrong with you?

17:15.366 --> 17:18.292
You look like a puerto rican
whore. You make me sick.

17:18.365 --> 17:20.560
So? What's it gotta do with you?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.431
Listen, pally,
you need to be rebellious.

17:23.507 --> 17:26.432
I raised kids.
I get it.

17:26.506 --> 17:28.571
- Good for you.
- You want a smack too?

17:28.647 --> 17:31.471
You ever tnk what this
is doing to your mother,

17:31.548 --> 17:34.942
What she's been through,
how you're upsetting her?

17:35.016 --> 17:36.543
She's just embarrassed.

17:36.585 --> 17:39.080
She cries for you.

17:39.158 --> 17:43.021
I'm gonna say this because
you're old enough to understan

17:43.085 --> 17:45.592
Your family's had
enough shame.

17:45.656 --> 17:47.320
You should
set things right.

17:49.228 --> 17:52.161
- You understand me?
- No.

17:52.236 --> 17:55.162
Jesus Christ.
Be a man.

17:55.236 --> 17:58.501
Be the kind of man she
needs-- Strong, masculine.

18:03.347 --> 18:05.343
I said my piece.

18:08.416 --> 18:11.050
Finish that thing. There's
no eating in the car.

18:13.358 --> 18:16.822
I would like to take a minute
for everybody to enjoy the fact

18:16.887 --> 18:18.692
That your mother
has sold her house.

18:18.757 --> 18:21.791
- Oh my God, that's fantastic.
- Congratulations, mom.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.730
- That's so good.
- Well, actually, it just passed inspection.

18:24.796 --> 18:26.892
Brian needs to get
loan approval before we can--

18:26.968 --> 18:28.633
All right,
all right, enough.

18:28.705 --> 18:31.872
Congratulations, Carm. It's not
an easy thing to do these days.

18:31.937 --> 18:34.073
I had a lot of support.

18:36.176 --> 18:39.610
- Brian and janine must be so happy.
- I hope so.

18:39.678 --> 18:42.042
Just the two?
It's big, right?

18:42.118 --> 18:43.582
It's a mansion.

18:43.645 --> 18:45.580
Pass the salad.

18:45.655 --> 18:48.322
They have a baby
on the way.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.902
<i>- Hello?
Have you looked outside?</i>

19:03.877 --> 19:06.872
Oh, Jesus, mellie.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.842
We replaced 60%,

19:08.907 --> 19:12.013
<i>50% of the bad lumber
with Doug fir.</i>

19:12.076 --> 19:13.812
What about the studs?

19:13.888 --> 19:16.841
And ose headers upstairs?
I'm nauseous.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.882
Oh, for the 100th time,

19:18.956 --> 19:22.020
I've done a Ton of houses
using the same construction

19:22.085 --> 19:25.421
Before these sob sisters took
over the building department

19:25.495 --> 19:29.120
And I'm not
losing any sleep.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.862
Lunch.

19:36.965 --> 19:40.702
- Mortadell' and provolone.
- That's Chrissy.

19:44.676 --> 19:47.070
Ho, the sterious stranger.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.013
- Hey.
- Long time.

19:49.085 --> 19:52.712
<i>Sit.
- I had to drop eli off at physical therapy.</i>

19:52.786 --> 19:54.851
I thought I would check in
on the brain trust here.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.190
- Asett', play a hand.
- Yeah, don't be shy, shylock.

19:58.225 --> 20:01.491
I got a little time.
Why not?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.390
<i>"Vy not," he says.</i>

20:03.466 --> 20:06.133
Did you hear the one
about the Jewish terrorist?

20:06.197 --> 20:09.133
He was gonna hijack a plane, but
he didn't wanna use his miles.

20:11.236 --> 20:13.402
- You want a sandwich?
- No, I just ate, thanks.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.942
He's not here to eat.

20:18.146 --> 20:21.083
He's here for the rent.
The rent, the rent.

20:21.147 --> 20:23.841
What are you talking about?

20:23.957 --> 20:25.511
You know what?
I'll have a beer.

20:25.588 --> 20:28.323
- Here you go.
- Will you stop already?

20:28.387 --> 20:30.121
That should get me through
another week, right?

20:32.596 --> 20:34.523
I got some
spare change here too.

20:38.296 --> 20:41.501
It's a joke.

20:41.565 --> 20:42.760
Where's that sense
of humor?

20:42.836 --> 20:46.702
You should put this
in the pot,

20:46.776 --> 20:49.441
- Make things interesting.
- I'll taka shot at that.

20:49.505 --> 20:52.673
- Let's play.
- Let's see it.

20:52.746 --> 20:54.782
Are you sure
you did it right?

20:54.845 --> 20:58.083
Yes, and it's normal.
Maybe it was the kung pao.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.512
- Get me a drink.
- Sure, alcohol,

21:00.586 --> 21:04.122
That's good for it.
Get one yourself.

21:04.197 --> 21:07.052
It's not the fucking msg.
It's Tony Soprano.

21:07.126 --> 21:10.892
You know, he really helped
when I was in the hoital.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.532
<i>- Never lend friends money, eli.
- He still won't pay?</i>

21:13.597 --> 21:15.733
That's the least of it.

21:15.765 --> 21:17.802
He's all worked up
or something.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.303
I don't like the way he
talks. Thathostile remarks.It.

21:21.377 --> 21:25.043
It's not like him.
Makes me worry.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.081
Yeah, I can see that.
What are you thinking?

21:28.186 --> 21:31.012
- Hmm.
- Come on.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.252
Tony's not gonna hurt you.

21:33.317 --> 21:36.722
You've seen how
these italians work.

21:36.787 --> 21:39.292
For the most part,
it's okay.

21:39.327 --> 21:41.123
Get them cornered,

21:41.165 --> 21:43.791
You're dealing with
nothing more than an animal.

21:43.868 --> 21:45.992
What, you think he's
going to kill you now?

21:46.066 --> 21:48.163
I don't fucking know.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.330
He's the guy I call to
deal with people like him.

21:52.406 --> 21:53.832
He's a rich man.
He'll pay.

21:53.907 --> 21:55.340
Minus assets?

21:55.445 --> 21:57.670
I would say under six.

21:57.748 --> 22:00.410
- Come on, he's a boss.
- I've known him for a long time.

22:00.477 --> 22:02.440
Money goes in one hand
and right out the other.

22:02.515 --> 22:04.180
The more he makes,
the more he spends.

22:04.255 --> 22:07.151
<i>That wife?</i>

22:07.187 --> 22:10.753
Eli, at what point
is it cheaper for him

22:10.828 --> 22:13.090
To settle it
another way?

22:27.178 --> 22:30.040
- That's three in a row, assholes.
- I'm bumping up here.

22:30.107 --> 22:32.670
Thank you, gentlemen.

22:32.718 --> 22:36.213
Roger will take care of you
from here on. Enjoy the borgata.

22:40.687 --> 22:42.782
Yeah, right.
Time to go.

22:45.795 --> 22:48.091
Yeah, we're up about...s.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.461
18.

22:50.526 --> 22:53.492
I could go for a rib eye,
flintstone size.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.802
No kidding.
What, because I'm up?

23:14.888 --> 23:17.323
- Holy shit.
- What?

23:17.398 --> 23:19.491
Batavia in the fifth.
Two to one.

23:20.995 --> 23:22.523
Meadow Gold in the fifth.

23:23.895 --> 23:25.793
We gotta do that.

23:25.866 --> 23:27.830
Three minutes to post.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.273
Glenlivet rocks.
Seven and seven.

23:32.336 --> 23:33.831
What do you have on tap?

23:33.907 --> 23:36.272
Give him a beer,
anything.

23:36.346 --> 23:39.870
Fuck it,
I don't wanna miss this.

23:39.945 --> 23:42.682
Batavia--
Here we go.

23:42.747 --> 23:46.012
- Where's the goddamn sound?
- The boss put $18,000 plus on this.

23:46.087 --> 23:49.280
- Maybe $25,000.
- Yeah?

23:49.385 --> 23:52.352
What the fuck's
your problem?

23:52.426 --> 23:55.220
Nothing, I'm excited.
What do you want?

23:55.298 --> 23:57.292
<i>All right, they're running here.</i>

23:57.408 --> 23:58.862
Where's the fucking sound?

23:58.936 --> 24:00.631
<i>It's on, Ton'.</i>

24:00.737 --> 24:02.203
Go, girl!

24:02.266 --> 24:03.560
- Go, you fucking nag.
Go!

24:05.508 --> 24:07.541
<i>There you go.</i>

24:07.607 --> 24:09.403
Come on, baby.
She's in the lead!

24:09.507 --> 24:12.073
- She's in the lead, come on.
- Come on, go, girl!

24:14.148 --> 24:17.353
Go go go!

24:17.418 --> 24:20.151
That a girl!
Go go go!

24:20.216 --> 24:23.921
<i>Rounding the turn,
swelligant, Meadow Gold, mestizo--</i>

24:23.997 --> 24:27.323
<i>Kir royale and smoosh baby falling back.</i>

24:27.398 --> 24:29.460
<i>It's swelligant
and Meadow Gold.</i>

24:29.528 --> 24:31.663
<i>- Come on, mead!
- Kir royale on the outside.</i>

24:31.738 --> 24:33.900
<i>Swelligant
and Meadow Gold...</i>

24:33.965 --> 24:35.331
<i>- swelligant and Meadow Gold...
- Fucking go!</i>

24:35.406 --> 24:37.602
<i>And it's swelligant
by a nose.</i>

24:37.678 --> 24:40.171
<i>Meadow Gold to place,</i>

24:40.236 --> 24:41.903
<i>Kir royale
rounding out the top.</i>

24:41.976 --> 24:46.013
<i>Mestizo, smoosh baby
in the five ot.</i>

24:56.128 --> 24:58.822
- By a cunt hair, Tony.
Heartbreaker.

24:58.897 --> 25:02.160
What are you
gonna do, huh?

25:02.226 --> 25:04.760
Madam, your desert.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.662
- I didn't order nothing.
- I ordered for you.

25:07.736 --> 25:10.931
You know I'm trying
to watch my weight.

25:11.008 --> 25:14.672
What is this?

25:14.706 --> 25:18.443
Oh my God.
Anthony?

25:18.515 --> 25:21.881
- You like it?
- It's gorgeous.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.050
I don't know
what to say.

25:25.115 --> 25:27.553
Look, I know you're
scared, okay?

25:27.658 --> 25:31.451
All the problems you had with
hector's dad-- I'm not like that.

25:31.528 --> 25:34.192
I know.
It's not just that.

25:34.227 --> 25:36.823
Well, what then?
I'm gonna workmy ass off.

25:36.897 --> 25:39.692
You know I'll always
take care of guys.

25:39.735 --> 25:42.060
In three months I made night
manager of the pizzeria.

25:42.138 --> 25:44.630
In another three I'll be in
charge of the day shifts too.

25:44.708 --> 25:48.340
A couple years, I'll own a
chain of restaurants, clubs.

25:48.406 --> 25:50.612
You'll never
have to work again.

25:53.077 --> 25:55.913
- Look, I love you.
- I love you too.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.582
So marry me then.
And we'll have kids.

25:58.658 --> 26:02.220
You always say you want hector
to have brothers and sisters.

26:07.096 --> 26:09.362
Okay.

26:22.578 --> 26:24.341
Can I get you some coffee?

26:24.448 --> 26:27.381
No, I think it's time
for our talk here.

26:30.517 --> 26:33.451
So what happened
at school today?

26:33.558 --> 26:35.220
I get blamed
for everything.

26:35.286 --> 26:37.790
The girl was
developmentally disabled.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.122
Uncle Phil said
he talked to you.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.692
Is he just wasting
his breath?

26:44.796 --> 26:46.731
Is that what
you're telling us?

26:50.808 --> 26:52.470
This trouble you're causing--

26:52.575 --> 26:55.102
M very disappointed, because
you always were a good kid.

26:55.146 --> 26:58.213
- You don't even know me.
- What is that supposed to mean?

26:58.276 --> 27:00.310
Sometimes you call me
"carlo jr."

27:02.245 --> 27:05.152
Look, all I know is that I couldn't shut
your dad up about what a good kid you were.

27:05.217 --> 27:08.053
- We were friends, you know.
- Butt buddies?

27:08.128 --> 27:10.992
Oh, you're being funny.

27:11.096 --> 27:13.052
That's good.

27:16.595 --> 27:20.060
'Cause I'm sure
you miss him a lot,

27:23.335 --> 27:25.403
Whatever he was.

27:29.946 --> 27:32.843
And now I wanna
say some things.

27:32.917 --> 27:36.443
- You're gonna look at me.
- I'm not moving to fucking maine!

27:38.787 --> 27:42.181
You know how much that's
gonna cost...y your mother?At?

27:42.257 --> 27:43.852
- Whatever.
- Listen to me.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.922
Okay, I'm not some
fucking social worker.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.791
Now you knock
this weird shit off,

27:47.868 --> 27:49.422
Or I'll introduce you
to a plate-Glass window.

27:49.497 --> 27:52.160
Somebody should have told my
dad to knock off the weird shit.

27:52.236 --> 27:54.601
You go about
in pity for yourself.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.531
What about your mother? What
about what she's been through?

27:56.607 --> 27:58.900
<i>What am I supposed
to do about it?</i>

28:11.855 --> 28:14.283
Look, your dad's gone, okay?
You're the man of the house now.

28:14.387 --> 28:17.180
Start fucking
acting like it.

28:17.255 --> 28:19.092
You get me?

28:42.188 --> 28:45.511
Well, I just got back
from the closing.

28:45.586 --> 28:47.550
Come here!

28:51.426 --> 28:53.850
We should pop
the champagne,

28:53.925 --> 28:56.360
- Or I don't know, go out or something.
- Maybe, I don't know.

28:56.426 --> 28:58.561
- Why not?
- You know why not, Tony.

28:58.595 --> 29:01.331
- It's upsetting, this whole thing.
- Jesus, the lumber again?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.870
Carmela, your cousin Brian has
fucked over a lot of people.

29:04.936 --> 29:07.100
Trust me.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.643
So how much in the end?
All in?

29:09.705 --> 29:12.941
Well, after construction,

29:13.015 --> 29:15.111
The purchase of the land,

29:15.185 --> 29:17.682
Closing costs, it must be close to six.

29:17.758 --> 29:19.910
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

29:19.957 --> 29:22.622
You know what
you should do?

29:22.725 --> 29:25.121
You should take a chunk of
that and put it on the jets.

29:25.228 --> 29:27.363
Oh yes,
very funny.

29:27.428 --> 29:30.260
- I'm serious. We can't get hurt.
- Oh, "we" now?

29:30.297 --> 29:32.792
It's a sure thing.
Celia, she works at the bing,

29:32.865 --> 29:35.462
She's got a sister
lives in san die,

29:35.566 --> 29:38.802
She's an osteopath, and she
says that the charger's qb

29:38.908 --> 29:42.443
Has a hairline fracture
in his right leg.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.870
And even Vegas
doesknow about it.

29:46.377 --> 29:48.310
I didn't say all of it.

29:48.418 --> 29:50.312
You know, just
a piece of my half.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.921
You're rich, Tony. Use some
of those bundles to cover it.

29:55.985 --> 29:58.550
That money's for emergencies
only, Carm, you know that.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.890
And my other money's tied up
in asset allocation.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.492
What is that?

30:02.568 --> 30:06.390
Listen to me, okay?
This is the gravy.

30:06.465 --> 30:08.263
Windfall cash.

30:08.337 --> 30:11.802
This is the kind of
shit you play with.

30:11.836 --> 30:15.442
I-- I'm telling you.
We are golden here.

30:28.025 --> 30:29.851
Ah, listen, listen.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.093
Forget it.

30:33.155 --> 30:35.460
I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

30:35.525 --> 30:38.490
I mean it.

30:38.566 --> 30:42.030
It's all right, it'St
I thought this was my money.

30:42.135 --> 30:44.101
You're right.

30:44.205 --> 30:45.370
You're right.

30:59.218 --> 31:00.481
Renata?

31:00.556 --> 31:03.123
What?

31:03.186 --> 31:05.550
- Go to the bedroom and lock the door.
- What's going on?

31:05.655 --> 31:07.792
Do as I ask.

31:15.936 --> 31:17.530
What are you doing here?

31:17.606 --> 31:18.971
Nice to see you, too.

31:19.037 --> 31:22.140
Oh, I was watching cnn.
Fucking hezbollah.

31:22.207 --> 31:24.711
Ah, we're running down
to the boat show in edison.

31:24.775 --> 31:26.742
- Thought you might want to join?
- I'd love to.

31:26.848 --> 31:29.880
Buenata's got
a migraine.

31:29.916 --> 31:31.082
That's too bad.

31:33.925 --> 31:37.350
The vig. Three grands.
Should put us up to date.

31:37.426 --> 31:40.392
Listen, I can't take this. Give
it all to me whenever you can.

31:40.426 --> 31:43.420
- You're gonna do thvery time?
- Whatever you say.

31:44.765 --> 31:46.731
Sit down.
Have a drink.

31:46.798 --> 31:47.903
We should get going,
probably.

31:47.965 --> 31:50.033
Okay.
But next time.

31:50.136 --> 31:51.272
For sure.

31:51.337 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, next time
I'll call first.

32:06.886 --> 32:08.852
Did you see that
pissy attitude?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.621
<i>Come all the way out here
to pick him up...</i>

32:10.696 --> 32:15.460
not to mention give him
his fucking vig in person.

32:16.495 --> 32:18.391
I mean, you believe
this fucking guy?

32:18.468 --> 32:21.531
Should tell him to go
fuck himself and his 200k.

32:24.205 --> 32:25.970
What's he gonna do
about it?

32:30.545 --> 32:33.340
To not pay my debts?
Head of the family?

32:33.415 --> 32:34.713
How's that gonna look?

32:34.787 --> 32:36.410
Who's gonna know?

32:38.788 --> 32:40.351
It's like Eddie valentine.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.052
That guy from philly?

32:42.155 --> 32:44.951
With the polio leg and
the built-Up shoe?

32:45.026 --> 32:46.622
No, from the fuckin'
"twilight zone."

32:46.658 --> 32:48.060
You must have
seen that one.

32:48.165 --> 32:49.962
He's a small-Time hood,
he gets shot...

32:49.995 --> 32:53.062
maybe you should start suckin'
cock instead of watching TV land,

32:53.137 --> 32:56.160
'Cause Vito brought in three
times what you do on construction.

32:57.437 --> 32:58.502
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:01.445 --> 33:04.513
And I didn't have
this fuckin' problem.

33:13.756 --> 33:16.253
God fuckin' damn it!

33:16.327 --> 33:18.293
What?

33:22.365 --> 33:24.632
That's good, right?

33:24.697 --> 33:27.301
No.
I only bet 10.

33:27.365 --> 33:29.301
- But you won.
- What did I say?

33:29.365 --> 33:31.301
Huh, what did I tell you?
It's a sure thing.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.601
You talk about this crap
like it's science, Tony.

33:33.675 --> 33:35.540
I lost a lot of
fuckin' money.

33:35.608 --> 33:37.673
You didn't lose.

33:37.746 --> 33:41.041
We could have turned your bullshit
into a fuckin' million dollars.

33:41.118 --> 33:42.441
My "bullshit"?

33:42.516 --> 33:44.953
That spec house was
my investment.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.451
- For my future!
- Here we go.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.881
Ginny Sack had to move in with
her fucking daughter, Tony

33:49.958 --> 33:51.893
Again with ginny Sack, huh?

33:51.956 --> 33:55.692
John provided.
She's a fuckin' hysteric.

33:55.725 --> 33:58.592
Did you ever think I
might know what I'm doing?

34:01.208 --> 34:03.400
You and the furniture
and the clothes and the cars.

34:03.467 --> 34:05.732
You would have spent
everything I made! If I let you.

34:05.807 --> 34:08.572
You know what? The next time
you win, I'll take a cut,

34:08.646 --> 34:10.172
And I'll roll
the fuckin' dice.

34:10.246 --> 34:12.743
You already took your cut,
from the bird feeder.

34:12.817 --> 34:15.783
And don't fuckin'
deny it again.

34:15.848 --> 34:17.751
What? 40 grand in
the stock market?

34:19.257 --> 34:21.782
I'd ask for my piece,
but wait, there's nothing.

34:27.268 --> 34:30.092
D that spec house?
I made the down payment.

34:30.197 --> 34:32.761
I bought the materials. I
leaned on that building inspector

34:32.866 --> 34:34.402
When you had your
thumb up your ass!

34:34.436 --> 34:36.331
So stop talking about
your money!

34:36.407 --> 34:38.333
Let go of me,
you piece of shit!

34:38.408 --> 34:41.143
Fact is you're a shitty businesswoman
who built a piece-Of-Shit house

34:41.208 --> 34:43.841
That's gonna cave in and
kill that fucking unborn baby

34:43.918 --> 34:45.710
Any day!

34:45.775 --> 34:47.940
And now
you can't sleep.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.451
Go fuck yourself!

34:52.516 --> 34:55.781
When I'm gone, you can live in a
fuckin' dumpster for all I care.

35:09.937 --> 35:12.070
I was so--
I told you, dude.

35:12.136 --> 35:15.042
At three-Point range, there's no
way the ball would hit the rim.

35:15.105 --> 35:16.302
That was the worst pass.

35:16.376 --> 35:17.812
Get lost.

35:22.646 --> 35:27.110
Hey, nobody drop the soap.
Spaz-A-Fuckwit's in the house.

35:28.485 --> 35:30.082
Hey, you can see
his pussy.

35:31.726 --> 35:33.221
What the fuck you
lookin' at, fag?

35:45.576 --> 35:47.200
- What the fuck?
- He St.

35:47.276 --> 35:48.600
<i>Oh!</i>

35:48.678 --> 35:51.343
<i>- Oh God!
- Jesus, what's wrong with you?</i>

35:51.418 --> 35:52.510
He stepped in it!

35:52.578 --> 35:54.411
<i>- Ah!
Gross!</i>

35:54.486 --> 35:56.880
<i>He shit in
the fucking shower!</i>

35:56.945 --> 35:58.680
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

35:58.755 --> 36:02.483
Cocksucker's corvair monza
is still in his garage,

36:02.558 --> 36:03.953
So we boost
the piece of shit.

36:04.026 --> 36:06.120
We're heading down
communipaw avenue,

36:06.197 --> 36:07.961
And the fuckin' thing
starts to do-Si-Do--

36:08.027 --> 36:09.591
You get word on
the power tools?

36:09.666 --> 36:13.961
What? Yeah. Spics in Florida
sending the first truck Friday.

36:14.036 --> 36:16.660
- How about alphonse at the hardware store?
- Ready for the whole load.

36:16.735 --> 36:20.331
Speaking of loads--
Hear the latest on Vito jr.?

36:20.407 --> 36:22.401
- What?
- Marie called. He got expelled

36:22.476 --> 36:24.512
'Cause he took a shit
in the shower in gym class.

36:24.577 --> 36:27.513
- Oh.
- That sick little fuck.

36:27.547 --> 36:29.380
You should see him--
The makeup.

36:29.448 --> 36:32.652
And without school, marie says
he's shut in his room all day.

36:32.716 --> 36:34.951
Probably thinkin' about how
to pull a columbine.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.151
Ha.

36:37.556 --> 36:39.652
But the little girl...

36:39.725 --> 36:41.320
<i>francesca.</i>

36:41.397 --> 36:43.791
Dad's gone.
Brother's a psycho,

36:43.865 --> 36:46.531
Mother's a basket case.
She's nine years old.

36:46.567 --> 36:48.362
What the fuck did
she ever do?

36:48.407 --> 36:49.663
Tragedy.

36:49.735 --> 36:52.900
Like a pebble in a lake.
Even the fish feel it.

36:55.305 --> 36:57.910
It's not right.

36:57.975 --> 37:01.343
Vito was one of us.

37:01.417 --> 37:04.250
So he sucked a cock. Prior
to that, he was our friend.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.082
Can't just cut
his family loose.

37:06.157 --> 37:10.053
That piece of shit, Phil,
he's never gonna pony up.

37:10.087 --> 37:13.850
I will never
forget that he didn't come through here.

37:13.928 --> 37:16.261
- Never.
- Let it go, Ton'.

37:17.998 --> 37:20.261
This is good of you, Ton',
helping marie.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.963
I'll always
remember it.

37:24.435 --> 37:26.871
All right, let's go.
I gotta swing by slava's,

37:26.935 --> 37:29.703
Liquefy some
offshore monies.

37:46.655 --> 37:50.090
<i>Yeah, dude.
Vamos al latino day parade.</i>

37:50.168 --> 37:52.533
<i>- Padre.
- Yeah.</i>

37:54.808 --> 37:57.101
Hey, Jesus,
you got outta work early.

37:57.168 --> 37:59.531
I need to talk to you.

38:00.907 --> 38:02.541
What's the matter?

38:09.686 --> 38:11.981
- What's this?
- Your clothes.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.612
I just did laundry
a couple days ago.

38:13.655 --> 38:15.150
Not laundry.

38:15.227 --> 38:17.922
<i>- Mami!
- No, papi, stay.</i>

38:17.995 --> 38:19.421
What are we doing?
What about the parade?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.892
I'm going
with my brother.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.662
What?

38:22.768 --> 38:25.192
I need to give this
back to you.

38:25.266 --> 38:26.932
I can't keep it.

38:26.998 --> 38:29.931
Why? I mean,
I love you.

38:30.005 --> 38:33.433
I love you, too,
Anthony.

38:36.376 --> 38:39.273
Look, I don't know.
Maybe I don't.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.952
All's I know is
I just don't feel it.

39:15.716 --> 39:18.382
You hear about this thing
with the dolphins' kicker?

39:18.486 --> 39:21.222
He went under
a whole truck.

39:23.856 --> 39:26.053
Yeah, fuckin'
motorcycles, huh?

39:27.827 --> 39:30.060
Helmet saved his life.

39:32.898 --> 39:35.401
- He out for Sunday?
- Maybe the whole season.

39:40.407 --> 39:44.643
And the baup kicker?
He's right out of college.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.013
- Against philly.
- Too good to be true.

39:48.818 --> 39:52.080
You know what? I'm gonna put the
whole 100k down on philadelphia.

39:52.155 --> 39:55.682
And if I win, marie Spatafore
gets her free ride and then some.

39:57.925 --> 39:59.751
Yeah, good for you.

39:59.828 --> 40:03.762
'Cause carlo said the kid went into
the litter box and ate some cat shit.

40:03.828 --> 40:06.033
No, he took a shit,
in the shower.

40:06.135 --> 40:08.663
Glad we got that straight.

40:08.738 --> 40:10.031
<i>Hell of a finish.</i>

40:10.106 --> 40:13.032
<i>Even tragedy,
unable to stop Miami.</i>

40:13.105 --> 40:16.603
<i>Miami 21, philadelphia 7.</i>

40:16.708 --> 40:18.470
<i>When you get
special-Team support like that,</i>

40:18.548 --> 40:20.272
<i>It makes all the difference.
And also, when you see...</i>

40:36.627 --> 40:39.591
hey, marie.
How you holdin' up?

40:39.666 --> 40:41.303
He snuck out again
last night.

40:41.366 --> 40:43.103
Like I told you,
I want to help.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.773
God bless you, Tony, because
I don't know what else to do.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.370
Well, I do.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.142
There's this camp in idaho,
and they handle kids like him.

40:50.205 --> 40:51.370
Idaho?

40:51.446 --> 40:52.910
You know,
like tough love?

40:52.977 --> 40:54.481
You know?

40:54.545 --> 40:56.243
Saw it on TV,
and honestly,

40:56.316 --> 40:59.852
I was moved to tears by
some of the success stories.

40:59.917 --> 41:02.551
- It's a camp?
- A school camp.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.922
<i>Tony,</i>

41:03.997 --> 41:06.791
They allow corporal
punishment.

41:06.858 --> 41:09.561
His guidance counselor
tolde about those places,

41:09.625 --> 41:12.293
And they're in Utah
and idaho

41:12.365 --> 41:15.400
Because state law allows
them to strike the kids.

41:15.467 --> 41:17.202
But that's just for
the deterrent factor.

41:17.278 --> 41:20.032
Look, it's 18 grand, but I'm
gonna take care of it for you,

41:20.107 --> 41:21.743
So don't worry.

41:24.345 --> 41:29.041
There's no geographical solution
to an emotional problem, marie.

41:29.118 --> 41:32.253
Maine, wherever.

41:35.357 --> 41:36.680
Marie?

41:36.756 --> 41:38.322
Yeah?

41:38.397 --> 41:40.493
I know it's hard,

41:40.565 --> 41:43.292
But it's the best
thing for him.

41:43.366 --> 41:45.460
<i>Okay?</i>

41:45.536 --> 41:46.931
Thank you, Tony.

42:45.698 --> 42:48.561
<i>Hey, Ton', isn't that--
What's-Their-Names,</i>

42:48.596 --> 42:50.490
<i>Used to hang out
at the bing?</i>

43:01.447 --> 43:04.012
- Wake up, Vito.
- What?

43:04.078 --> 43:07.010
Vito, my name is steve.
I'm here to help you.

43:07.077 --> 43:09.383
You're gonna come
with us now, all right?

43:09.445 --> 43:10.781
- Come on.
- What?

43:10.886 --> 43:12.352
Come on.

43:12.416 --> 43:14.020
No, let me go!

43:14.085 --> 43:16.283
- Come on. Hey!
- It's all right.

43:16.358 --> 43:18.350
- Let go! Mom, no!
- It's gonna be okay.

43:18.426 --> 43:21.063
I'm so sorry, honey.

43:21.127 --> 43:22.121
Stop, let me go!

43:22.227 --> 43:24.261
It'll be okay!

43:24.338 --> 43:27.532
Hey, you have E strong.
You're doing the right thing.

43:27.608 --> 43:29.800
- Who are you?
- Franny, go back to bed.

43:29.906 --> 43:31.801
Mrs. Spatafore, really,
he's gonna be fine.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.943
<i>- Mom!
- I'm sorry, honey.</i>

43:33.976 --> 43:36.040
<i>No! No.</i>

43:36.108 --> 43:38.172
Oh God.

43:39.448 --> 43:41.042
This one coming right
down to the buzzer.

43:41.118 --> 43:43.682
Stackhouse draining
a three-Pointer

43:43.747 --> 43:47.650
As time ran out, leading
dallas to a 109 to 108 victory

43:47.728 --> 43:49.753
<i>Over the visiting
san antonio spurs.</i>

43:49.828 --> 43:52.423
<i>A sterling effort for sure,
but you really can't...</i>

43:58.337 --> 44:00.161
so what?
We're not speaking now?

44:01.966 --> 44:05.471
Listen, come here.

44:09.006 --> 44:10.270
What?

44:12.347 --> 44:14.443
Sit down.

44:14.545 --> 44:16.510
Come on.

44:24.925 --> 44:27.122
I'm sorry.

44:28.966 --> 44:31.563
I really am.

44:31.635 --> 44:34.701
You did real good
with that house.

44:36.236 --> 44:38.402
And I should know.
I'm in construction.

44:38.478 --> 44:40.940
I'm glad to hear
you approve.

44:41.006 --> 44:43.672
I have been losing.

44:43.746 --> 44:46.111
I'm fuckin' losing
right now.

44:47.515 --> 44:49.043
On a shitty streak.

44:49.116 --> 44:52.511
So your solution is to risk
more and make things even worse?

44:52.585 --> 44:55.280
You start chasing it.

44:55.356 --> 44:58.421
And every time you get
your hands around it...

44:59.826 --> 45:01.293
you fall further
backwards.

45:01.368 --> 45:04.630
So this is about money?
'Cause it didn't feel like it.

45:04.697 --> 45:08.162
Carm, I swear to you, you're
not gonna be like ginny.

45:08.236 --> 45:09.663
I've been real good
about that,

45:09.737 --> 45:11.572
And frankly, it's not
gonna happen to us.

45:11.635 --> 45:15.472
And I hate that you're going around
acting all the time like it will.

45:18.845 --> 45:21.141
I worry, Tony.
I do.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.082
You already got shot.

45:24.158 --> 45:26.911
Now you won't even go down and
get the paper. Who is out there?

45:26.987 --> 45:28.883
- Come on...
- What is it?

45:28.957 --> 45:30.692
What are the million
other possibilits?

45:30.757 --> 45:32.493
The FBI waiting
to take you away?

45:32.557 --> 45:35.020
Right? You eat
and you play,

45:35.097 --> 45:37.663
And you pretend like there's not
a giant piano hanging by a rope

45:37.736 --> 45:40.360
Just over the top of your
head every minute of every day.

45:40.437 --> 45:42.831
See, that's it, okay?
I've been thinking about this.

45:42.907 --> 45:47.102
Now, I survived a fuckin'
gunshot wound.

45:47.177 --> 45:48.670
What are the odds
on that?

45:48.748 --> 45:50.203
Terrible.

45:50.276 --> 45:52.911
So if you think about it,
big-Picturewise,

45:52.978 --> 45:54.341
I'm up.

45:54.417 --> 45:56.042
What?

45:56.147 --> 45:58.280
Way up.

46:03.827 --> 46:07.023
That was me,
not a fireboat.

46:08.226 --> 46:09.823
10:30.

46:09.896 --> 46:13.462
10:30. What would you
like for breakfast? Hmm?

46:16.737 --> 46:18.533
Renata?

46:18.608 --> 46:20.100
Renata?

46:20.176 --> 46:22.403
Oh God, no.

46:22.476 --> 46:25.340
Wait wait,
renata.

46:27.445 --> 46:29.182
Renata.

46:29.248 --> 46:31.382
Renata, please,
oh, wait.

46:31.457 --> 46:35.121
<i>- Renata, renata.
911. What is the emergency?</i>

47:05.557 --> 47:07.750
She was a great girl.

47:07.827 --> 47:09.282
Thanks.

47:09.355 --> 47:12.252
The best.

47:15.668 --> 47:17.531
I--

47:17.597 --> 47:19.031
I brought your money.

47:27.806 --> 47:30.403
Sorry for your loss.
