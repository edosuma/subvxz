WEBVTT

00:05.490 --> 00:07.117
Screens. Buzz!

00:08.031 --> 00:09.131
It's not me.

00:09.132 --> 00:10.676
It's Fraud downstairs

00:10.677 --> 00:12.296
Our remotes use the same signal.

00:12.297 --> 00:14.593
If you just let me
change the frequency...

00:14.594 --> 00:16.444
No, Fraud can change their remote.

00:17.046 --> 00:18.142
But they won't.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.405
The signal shouldn't be able to go through
the four walls anyway, Buzz

00:23.237 --> 00:26.135
There is a design flaw in
this part of the building.

00:26.824 --> 00:28.858
Yeah. Uh, lieutenant Provenza,
Major Crimes.

00:28.893 --> 00:31.528
I want to speak to whoever's
in charge down there.

00:34.064 --> 00:36.366
Good evening. L.A.P.D.
Major Crimes. Detective Gabriel.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.468
Buzz, where's the mushroom pizza?

00:38.502 --> 00:39.702
There's nothing here
that's vegetarian.

00:39.737 --> 00:41.838
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no Detective Erico here.

00:41.872 --> 00:42.750
They were out of mushrooms,

00:42.751 --> 00:44.474
so I got you a pizza with
bell peppers on it instead.

00:44.508 --> 00:45.975
Bell peppers?! Guys, I can't hear.

00:46.010 --> 00:47.944
When have you ever seen me
eat a bell pepper?! Hello?

00:47.978 --> 00:49.812
It's a vegetable! Ma'am,
are you in some kind of trouble?

00:49.847 --> 00:52.181
Guys! Would you shut up, please?!

00:52.216 --> 00:55.251
Hello? Ma'am? Are you still there?

00:55.286 --> 00:58.421
Woman: There's somebody in my house.
There's somebody here.

00:58.455 --> 01:00.423
O-okay, ma'am. You know what?
Give me your name and address.

01:00.457 --> 01:02.425
And we'll get someone
over to you right away.

01:02.459 --> 01:04.427
I need Detective Erico.

01:04.461 --> 01:06.095
Okay. Uh, Detective Erico.
Erico! Guys...

01:06.130 --> 01:07.541
Anyone ever hear of this Erico?

01:07.542 --> 01:09.499
Ma'am, we're searching
for Detective Erico.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.200
But right now, I need you
to tell me where you are.

01:11.235 --> 01:13.202
What's your address? Oh, no.
You won't get here soon enough.

01:13.237 --> 01:15.605
I'm in trouble now! Ma'am...

01:15.639 --> 01:16.403
All right. Ma'am, just...

01:16.404 --> 01:17.840
There's somebody here.
I have to go get my gun.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.776
Okay, just stay calm and
tell me your address.

01:19.810 --> 01:23.112
Look, I can't talk louder.
If I can just get to my gun...

01:23.147 --> 01:24.948
Erico? Anyone? Anything?

01:24.982 --> 01:27.450
No Erico here.
Maybe a different spelling.

01:27.484 --> 01:29.786
Okay, ma'am, stay calm,
okay? My gun... my gun is gone!

01:29.820 --> 01:31.554
It's... it's not here!

01:31.589 --> 01:32.964
Oh, my Go...

01:35.225 --> 01:38.294
Hello? Hello? Ma'am,
are you there? Hello?

01:38.329 --> 01:39.287
Damn it! We got to get her back.

01:39.288 --> 01:40.508
We got to get her back right now!

01:40.509 --> 01:41.509
Her phone line is blocked.

01:41.764 --> 01:43.197
So unless she calls us back,
there's nothing we can do.

01:43.198 --> 01:44.367
Except find Detective Erico!

01:44.401 --> 01:46.436
Why couldn't you guys
find Detective Erico?!

01:46.470 --> 01:49.172
She might've been running
the two words together.

01:49.206 --> 01:51.541
There's a Detective "Verico," with a "V,"

01:51.575 --> 01:53.042
works threat management.

01:53.077 --> 01:55.445
Stalking cases.

01:55.479 --> 01:58.982
Tao, yeah, let's get this
Detective Verico up here

01:59.016 --> 02:00.584
with his open case files.

02:00.585 --> 02:01.644
Where's chief Johnson?

02:01.645 --> 02:04.854
She's in an interview with some
police commissioners downstairs.

02:04.888 --> 02:06.055
Somebody should run down,

02:06.090 --> 02:09.025
pass her a note about
what's going on. Buzz.

02:09.059 --> 02:10.827
Detective Verico's
got the week off.

02:10.860 --> 02:11.735
They said it's gonna take at least

02:11.736 --> 02:12.996
an hour before they bring
his case files up here.

02:13.030 --> 02:15.827
Give me that.
This is commander Taylor.

02:15.828 --> 02:19.002
I want Verico's cases,
and I need lights and sirens

02:19.036 --> 02:22.572
headed to every female on his
list of stalking victims.

02:22.606 --> 02:25.008
Unh-unh, unh-unh. Right now.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.486 --> 02:37.754
Everything to the rear of
the residence is clear.

02:37.788 --> 02:41.157
Nobody home. Copy that.

02:41.191 --> 02:45.228
Same with the front rooms.
There's nothing here.

02:47.131 --> 02:49.098
All clear on the second floor!

02:49.133 --> 02:51.434
Yeah, we got nothing
down here, either.

02:51.468 --> 02:52.969
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.

02:53.003 --> 02:54.270
I hope you understand.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.305
We, uh, we just have to check
these things out sometimes.

02:56.340 --> 02:57.507
Not a problem... really.

03:08.419 --> 03:10.653
Clear! Clear the door!

03:15.092 --> 03:19.062
16863. I have a female
down inside my location.

03:19.096 --> 03:19.878
Gunshot wound.

03:19.879 --> 03:21.799
She does not appear to be breathing.
Roll paramedics.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.334
And advise major crimes
we found their victim.

03:28.312 --> 03:29.986
Danielle Ross.

03:30.638 --> 03:33.574
43 years old. Single. Lived alone.

03:33.608 --> 03:35.109
She dialed my extension by mistake

03:35.143 --> 03:38.645
little over two hours ago
looking for Detective Verico,

03:38.680 --> 03:40.547
who works in threat management.

03:40.582 --> 03:42.983
Ms. Ross was shot once
in the right temple area.

03:43.017 --> 03:45.167
The bullet entered and exited,

03:45.168 --> 03:47.457
hitting the wall over
there by Sanchez.

03:48.089 --> 03:50.675
Judging by what looks to
be a .40 caliber casing

03:50.676 --> 03:51.956
over here on the floor,

03:51.957 --> 03:55.821
the weapon was fired from
somewhere around...here.

03:55.822 --> 03:59.233
We found a .40 caliber hand gun
in a trash can behind the house.

03:59.267 --> 04:00.334
It might be her weapon.

04:00.368 --> 04:02.669
We're checking the
registration right now.

04:02.704 --> 04:03.857
Box cutter?

04:03.858 --> 04:06.326
With a broken blade.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.506
Think maybe she used that to
try and fend off her attacker?

04:09.541 --> 04:12.376
Maybe, chief. But look at this.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.814
She was shot...

04:16.848 --> 04:20.017
And her throat was cut. Ugh.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.019
Yeah, the, uh, throat
injury happened postmortem.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.687
If someone had severed her jugular

04:23.721 --> 04:26.356
while she was still alive....
..We'd be walking in blood.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.292
Any idea how the killer got in?

04:28.326 --> 04:29.560
No.

04:29.594 --> 04:32.262
And, uh, there's no
sign of forced entry.

04:32.297 --> 04:34.298
Now, there are three
doors to the house.

04:34.332 --> 04:36.700
The front door,
which was dead-bolted

04:36.734 --> 04:39.036
and chain-locked from the inside...

04:39.070 --> 04:40.804
Uh, before we breached it.

04:40.839 --> 04:42.539
And this door leads to the garage,

04:42.574 --> 04:44.908
which was locked when we got here.

04:44.943 --> 04:47.419
And the electric
garage door is shut.

04:49.681 --> 04:52.683
And the back door is
the only other exit.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.017
No chain but dead-bolted.

04:54.052 --> 04:56.987
Also, all the windows
were barred and locked.

04:57.021 --> 04:59.556
So there was no way for the
killer to enter or exit.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.092
Yeah, it's kind of like a
crime scene and a magic trick.

05:02.126 --> 05:06.196
Hey, I found the tip to
that box-cutter blade.

05:06.231 --> 05:07.845
Must have snapped off

05:07.846 --> 05:11.201
when the, uh,
cord to this phone was cut.

05:11.236 --> 05:14.204
All right, then. We know how
this conversation ended.

05:14.239 --> 05:17.541
Let's go back to how it began.
Ms. Ross called my desk.

05:17.575 --> 05:21.266
I thought she was asking for a
Detective Erico... not Verico.

05:21.267 --> 05:23.114
And she said someone
was in her house.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.329
She needed to get her gun.

05:24.330 --> 05:25.916
She said it was in her nightstand,

05:25.950 --> 05:27.584
back in her bedroom, I guess.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.786
Someone's in my house!
Someone's here!

05:29.821 --> 05:31.955
I can't speak louder.

05:32.823 --> 05:34.324
Somebody's in my house.

05:34.359 --> 05:35.551
I have to get my gun.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.497
My gun is not here! It's gone!

05:40.531 --> 05:42.622
Should be in my nightstand.

05:53.636 --> 05:55.612
Ms. Ross spoke to you from here.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.448
While she was searching
for her weapon, yeah.

05:59.635 --> 06:03.186
There's no door out of
the house from here.

06:03.221 --> 06:05.237
And the windows are barred.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.278
Maybe she made a run for it?

06:26.978 --> 06:30.784
Chief, this is Detective Frank
Verico from threat management.

06:30.785 --> 06:32.716
Sorry it took me so
long to get here.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.584
I'm off this week.
Thank you for coming, Detective.

06:34.619 --> 06:36.420
Any idea how all this happened?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.389
No.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.291
But twice I tried to
convince the commissioner

06:41.326 --> 06:43.460
she needed police protection -
she wouldn't take it.

06:43.494 --> 06:44.611
Excuse me. Uh, did you

06:44.612 --> 06:46.797
just refer to our victim
as 'commissioner'?

06:47.653 --> 06:48.465
Yes, I did.

06:49.324 --> 06:51.060
Danielle Ross heads...

06:52.262 --> 06:54.237
headed the California
state parole board.

06:58.047 --> 06:59.476
And why did you think

06:59.510 --> 07:01.409
commissioner Ross
needed protection?

07:01.410 --> 07:02.364
Did it have something to do

07:02.365 --> 07:04.815
with a prisoner she
refused to release?

07:04.849 --> 07:06.116
I'm not sure.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.051
There was no verbal
or written threat.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.244
But about a month ago,
she stopped on her way home

07:11.245 --> 07:12.622
from work for a
doctor's appointment.

07:12.657 --> 07:15.058
And while her car was parked,
someone broke into it.

07:15.865 --> 07:18.128
And how did that
become your problem?

07:22.785 --> 07:23.545
Patrol called me in

07:23.546 --> 07:25.435
because the commissioner's a
high-ranking state official.

07:26.014 --> 07:26.749
You know, to be honest,

07:26.750 --> 07:27.980
I thought what
happened to her vehicle

07:27.981 --> 07:30.050
was more like vandalism
than anything else.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.875
Why do you say that?

07:31.876 --> 07:34.745
Because nothing was
stolen from her car

07:34.779 --> 07:37.453
and she had cash and credit
cards in her console.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.769
I suggested she get police
protection just in case.

07:42.453 --> 07:44.182
Commissioner turned me down flat.

07:44.801 --> 07:46.651
Didn't think it was worth the cost.

07:46.652 --> 07:48.068
Neither did I, really.

07:49.332 --> 07:50.794
Until someone broke into her home.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.864
You mean before tonight?

07:54.618 --> 07:55.665
Yes, ma'am.

07:56.091 --> 07:57.234
Last Wednesday.

07:58.004 --> 07:58.915
She called and said

07:58.916 --> 08:00.963
somebody had been in her
house while she was at work.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.735
Maybe that's why someone
broke into her car...

08:02.736 --> 08:03.938
to get her home address.

08:03.939 --> 08:05.652
No. If they knew
which car was hers,

08:05.653 --> 08:07.102
they could've just
followed her home.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.502
Hold off on the car for a minute.

08:08.503 --> 08:10.206
We've just been through
commissioner Ross' house,

08:10.207 --> 08:11.752
and it's all but
hermetically sealed.

08:11.753 --> 08:13.602
Detective, do you have
any idea how someone

08:13.603 --> 08:15.269
could have slipped through
the bars on her windows

08:15.270 --> 08:17.763
and the locks on
her doors... twice?

08:17.764 --> 08:18.716
No.

08:19.645 --> 08:20.712
And, just like her car,

08:20.713 --> 08:22.934
she said nothing was
stolen from her residence.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.223
And before you ask me why
someone would burglarize her car

08:25.224 --> 08:26.736
and her home and not take anything,

08:26.737 --> 08:28.499
I don't know... neither did she.

08:30.059 --> 08:31.620
Where is everybody? Excuse me?

08:31.621 --> 08:33.654
Have you even notified the
sheriff's department yet?

08:33.655 --> 08:34.693
Do we have protection in place

08:34.693 --> 08:36.327
for the other members
of the parole board?

08:36.328 --> 08:37.308
You should at least have

08:37.309 --> 08:38.611
gang support down here
reviewing the case.

08:38.613 --> 08:40.942
Look, before we do all that,
I'm getting a few facts here.

08:40.943 --> 08:42.542
You want facts? Here's a fact.

08:42.543 --> 08:44.514
The head of a state
law-enforcement agency

08:44.549 --> 08:46.583
was murdered while on the
phone with major crimes!

08:46.617 --> 08:48.418
That's a fact! 
Verico: That's not their fault, chief.

08:48.453 --> 08:51.088
The commissioner mixed up the
last two digits of my work phone

08:51.122 --> 08:52.589
and got Detective
Gabriel instead of me.

08:52.623 --> 08:54.691
You're Verico? Yes, sir.

08:54.725 --> 08:56.960
You were the lead investigator
into these threats

08:56.994 --> 08:58.095
against commissioner Ross?

08:58.129 --> 09:00.097
Uh, excuse me, but there
were no actual threats.

09:00.131 --> 09:01.098
Well, she's dead.

09:01.132 --> 09:02.499
And she was murdered

09:02.533 --> 09:04.468
when the L.A.P.D. had an open
case with her name on it.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.903
So obviously, she was under
some sort of a threat.

09:06.938 --> 09:08.817
While we figure that out,
Detective Verico,

09:08.818 --> 09:10.780
I think it would be in the
best interest of the department

09:10.781 --> 09:13.238
if you just, uh,
continue with your week off.

09:31.017 --> 09:32.095
How does this happen?

09:32.130 --> 09:34.531
How does major crimes take
a call from this woman...

09:34.565 --> 09:36.466
Sir... Sir, I can explain.

09:36.501 --> 09:39.202
You can explain why...
why not one officer, not one patrol car

09:39.237 --> 09:41.705
was dispatched to -
to the commissioner's house

09:41.739 --> 09:43.273
until after she was murdered -
you can explain that?!

09:43.307 --> 09:45.642
I tried to get her... Okay,
excuse me. Excuse me!

09:45.676 --> 09:47.878
Chief Pope, can we talk
in my office for a moment?

09:55.920 --> 09:56.953
Thank you very much.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.822
Look, Danielle Ross
was on the phone

09:58.856 --> 10:02.058
for less than a minute with
us before the line went dead.

10:02.093 --> 10:04.928
She never identified herself
or gave her address.

10:04.962 --> 10:07.164
Okay even if that's true,

10:07.198 --> 10:09.766
the L.A.P.D. knew that
commissioner Ross' safety

10:09.800 --> 10:13.069
was at risk before she was
gunned down in her home!

10:19.192 --> 10:20.911
All right, look.
Here's what I need you to do.

10:20.945 --> 10:23.180
I need you to launch a
thorough investigation

10:23.214 --> 10:25.248
of every inmate who's
been denied parole

10:25.283 --> 10:27.484
for the last six mon-
make... make it a year...

10:27.518 --> 10:28.718
uh, hold on. Hold on.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.787
Will, asking me to
stop what I'm doing now

10:30.821 --> 10:32.822
may end up slowing down
our process. Slow down?!

10:32.857 --> 10:34.624
Brenda, I don't think you get this!

10:34.659 --> 10:35.792
We're so far behind now,

10:35.826 --> 10:38.461
I don't... I don't know
if we can catch up!

10:41.232 --> 10:42.532
How did this happen?

10:42.567 --> 10:45.435
Look, will, for your own sake,
just take a deep breath, okay?

10:45.469 --> 10:47.437
I-I know you're feeling
some extra pressure

10:47.471 --> 10:49.105
because of this whole
chief business...

10:49.140 --> 10:50.532
So now, on top of everything else,

10:50.533 --> 10:52.549
you're accusing me
of overreacting?!

10:52.550 --> 10:53.389
You want to know what I think?

10:53.390 --> 10:54.487
I think your own
reaction to this case

10:54.488 --> 10:57.632
has been slow, unimpressive,
and potentially dangerous

10:57.633 --> 10:59.625
to the rest of the parole-board
members in the state.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.351
Okay! That's it!

11:01.385 --> 11:03.220
You don't like the way
I'm handling this case,

11:03.254 --> 11:04.955
that's just fine.

11:04.989 --> 11:07.057
You should just take
it over yourself.

11:07.722 --> 11:09.659
You know what? That's
exactly what I'm gonna do.

11:33.329 --> 11:35.675
Operation swift justice.

11:36.578 --> 11:38.660
What a ridiculous name.

11:39.486 --> 11:41.371
And all these people
Pope's brought in to...

11:41.372 --> 11:44.552
Watch him throw everything the
department has at this murder.

11:44.586 --> 11:45.680
And they're all from
law enforcement,

11:45.681 --> 11:46.913
so maybe they'll end up helping us.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.634
They're not gonna
end up helping Pope.

11:48.635 --> 11:51.227
If he thinks we really
made some kind of mistake

11:51.228 --> 11:52.492
with commissioner Ross,

11:52.493 --> 11:54.811
he just announced it
to the whole state.

11:54.812 --> 11:56.422
And then asking us to review

11:56.423 --> 11:58.708
everyone up for parole
over the past year...

11:58.709 --> 12:00.445
That's a complete waste of time.

12:00.446 --> 12:01.729
Well, look, maybe not.

12:01.730 --> 12:03.388
I got an interesting fax

12:03.389 --> 12:06.155
from the warden at
folsom this morning.

12:06.156 --> 12:09.225
He's got a prisoner -
Tomas Medina.

12:09.909 --> 12:12.430
Commissioner Ross denied him
release just two months ago.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.977
He's serving time for
a murder-for-hire.

12:13.978 --> 12:16.610
And he's implying that he put
a hit out on the commissioner.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.101
Murder-for-hire.

12:21.596 --> 12:23.837
You didn't tell Pope
about this, did you?

12:23.838 --> 12:26.583
No. No. I don't want him
to do anything too hasty.

12:27.488 --> 12:30.023
Believe me, I know exactly
what we're up against here.

12:30.058 --> 12:32.192
I'm doing everything I can
to conduct this investigation

12:32.226 --> 12:34.311
so it doesn't blow up in our faces.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.377
Excuse me.
Uh, chief Pope wants you.

12:36.378 --> 12:38.629
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

12:39.148 --> 12:41.940
Well, if it does blow up, be aware.

12:41.941 --> 12:44.460
It's set to explode
in your murder room.

12:44.461 --> 12:47.599
Pope isn't the only one who
needs to watch his back.

12:48.661 --> 12:49.925
Thanks.

13:03.858 --> 13:06.626
I guess you have a good reason
for not telling me about Medina.

13:07.752 --> 13:08.762
Who?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.098
Tomas Medina.

13:11.132 --> 13:14.167
Currently serving the 20th year
of a 30-year sentence at folsom

13:14.202 --> 13:17.281
for hiring a busboy at his
restaurant to off his wife.

13:17.559 --> 13:20.741
The warden at folsom
contacted you this morning

13:20.775 --> 13:21.950
after searching Medina's cell

13:21.951 --> 13:23.671
and finding articles
about the commissioner,

13:23.672 --> 13:25.945
the last of which had a
photo with the word "dead"

13:25.946 --> 13:27.329
scrawled across her face.

13:27.330 --> 13:29.503
Please don't pretend any
of this is news to you.

13:29.504 --> 13:32.081
I'm not. I'm just trying to
figure out how you know all this.

13:32.586 --> 13:35.020
I'm being copied on all
information on this case.

13:35.021 --> 13:37.865
And I've ordered air support
to fly Medina down from folsom.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.364
He should be here
by 2:00 P.M. today.

13:39.365 --> 13:41.956
What?! You can't do that!

13:41.957 --> 13:43.554
I know next to nothing about him.

13:43.555 --> 13:45.009
Well, then educate yourself.

13:45.010 --> 13:47.819
Because with state police
and sheriff's deputies

13:47.820 --> 13:48.714
and state prison officials

13:48.715 --> 13:50.498
here helping with operation:
Swift justice,

13:50.499 --> 13:52.425
we need equal emphasis on "swift."

13:52.426 --> 13:54.858
This is not the way to handle this,
will. It just isn't.

13:56.511 --> 13:58.412
All right, can you say for sure

13:58.928 --> 14:00.280
that commissioner Ross' murder

14:00.314 --> 14:02.315
was an attack against
her and her alone

14:02.350 --> 14:04.151
and that the rest of
the state parole board

14:04.185 --> 14:05.452
is in no danger whatsoever?

14:05.486 --> 14:07.954
Because unless you can state
that with absolute certainty,

14:07.989 --> 14:09.322
time may not be on our side.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.058
Now, Medina is coming.

14:12.093 --> 14:14.661
And ready or not,
I need you to talk to him.

14:24.893 --> 14:26.640
Okay, lieutenant Provenza,
I want you to search

14:26.674 --> 14:29.342
all crime reports where a box
cutter was used as a weapon

14:29.377 --> 14:31.678
and see if there's a
connection to Tomas Medina.

14:31.712 --> 14:34.114
And until Mr. Medina arrives...

14:34.148 --> 14:36.516
Don't worry, chief.
I'll keep Pope distracted.

14:36.551 --> 14:37.584
Thank you so much.

14:37.618 --> 14:39.286
Uh, Detective Sanchez,
lieutenant Flynn,

14:39.320 --> 14:41.455
I want to know everything there
is to know about Mr. Medina.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.734
Friends, family, associates.

14:42.735 --> 14:44.691
We'll get a morgue
report while we're at it.

14:44.725 --> 14:46.760
Thank you. Lieutenant tao,
please examine

14:46.794 --> 14:49.029
commissioner Ross' personal
and work computers.

14:49.063 --> 14:50.034
Maybe there are threats on

14:50.035 --> 14:51.865
there she didn't let
Detective Verico know about.

14:51.899 --> 14:54.968
Detective Gabriel, I'd like
to speak to Detective Verico.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.271
So would I, chief,
but he's not answering his phone.

14:58.306 --> 15:00.507
No, I don't mean call him.
I want to speak to him in person.

15:00.541 --> 15:02.843
The way Pope sent him home,
that's going to be tough.

15:02.877 --> 15:05.378
Hey, chief, considering
how swamped our office is,

15:05.413 --> 15:07.214
you have some idea where
you'd like us to regroup?

15:09.466 --> 15:11.952
Johnson... Detective Verico,
thank you for coming.

15:11.986 --> 15:13.320
Why don't you have a seat?

15:13.354 --> 15:16.156
Yeah, let's, uh, have a seat

15:16.190 --> 15:18.959
and we can all chat about
what happened yesterday.

15:19.411 --> 15:20.727
How about I sit when I'm ready?

15:21.230 --> 15:22.141
Because if you asked me here

15:22.142 --> 15:23.897
to go over everything
I did wrong again,

15:23.931 --> 15:25.632
you can talk to my union rep.

15:25.666 --> 15:26.503
Detective, we asked you

15:26.504 --> 15:28.068
here because we could
really use your help.

15:28.481 --> 15:30.270
Listen, when I spoke
to commissioner Ross,

15:30.304 --> 15:33.173
the only person she
wanted to talk to was you.

15:33.747 --> 15:36.710
She was in trouble, and it was
you she was reaching out to.

15:45.853 --> 15:48.074
I called her every other day,
you know?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.453
Just to make sure
she was all right.

15:51.292 --> 15:53.527
I even helped her get the
locks on her house changed.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.225
I'm sure you did everything
you could, Detective.

15:55.713 --> 15:59.132
Please sit down. Come on, Frank.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.745
You know why it took me so
long to get to her house

16:11.779 --> 16:13.268
the night she was shot?

16:13.814 --> 16:15.549
Because almost the entire L.A.P.D.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.384
is seven days on, seven days off.

16:17.418 --> 16:19.252
How am I supposed to
look out after people

16:19.287 --> 16:21.388
if the budget determines
when I can work?

16:21.422 --> 16:23.590
Maybe if the right
person becomes chief,

16:23.624 --> 16:26.293
our budget priorities
will turn for the better.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.229
Uh, Detective Verico,
the other night you told me

16:29.263 --> 16:32.265
that Danielle Ross thought her
house had been broken into

16:32.300 --> 16:34.100
a week before she was murdered.

16:34.135 --> 16:37.037
Since nothing was stolen,
what made her so sure of that?

16:37.796 --> 16:40.240
Seemed to her like someone
had gone through her mail.

16:41.406 --> 16:43.476
Uh, closet light was left on.

16:43.511 --> 16:46.146
But what really convinced her
was the smell of gardenias.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.981
Specifically in her bedroom.

16:48.015 --> 16:50.125
Gardenia? You mean like
the flower... gardenia?

16:50.126 --> 16:51.651
Like a perfume.

16:52.107 --> 16:53.116
It wasn't much to go on,

16:53.117 --> 16:56.027
but I printed the entire house anyway,
questioned neighbors.

16:56.028 --> 16:58.308
And, again,
I contacted state police

16:58.309 --> 17:00.470
and urged her to accept protection.

17:00.817 --> 17:02.162
But she refused.

17:02.820 --> 17:03.730
Yeah.

17:06.148 --> 17:08.045
I don't know what I missed.

17:13.303 --> 17:14.808
Come on, Frank.

17:15.252 --> 17:16.343
I'll take you home.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.625
Thank you so much for coming.

17:26.344 --> 17:28.450
Did you find out yet how
someone broke into her house

17:28.451 --> 17:30.139
and why nothing was stolen?

17:32.517 --> 17:35.126
Uh, something was stolen,
Detective.

17:35.127 --> 17:37.075
She was shot to death
with her own gun.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.167
But... but she didn't
even know it was missing

17:41.202 --> 17:43.370
until she went looking for it.

17:46.641 --> 17:48.441
So I did miss something.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.244
Come on, man.

18:06.260 --> 18:09.829
Lieutenant tao! No!
No people food for Joel!

18:09.864 --> 18:12.298
I'm sorry, chief.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.334
What do you think you're doing?

18:14.368 --> 18:15.669
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

18:17.138 --> 18:18.638
No begging. Go on, now.

18:18.673 --> 18:20.807
Go on, you little smushy-smush!

18:20.841 --> 18:23.243
Okay, lieutenant.
What'd you find out?

18:23.277 --> 18:24.544
No threats and nothing compromised

18:24.578 --> 18:25.812
with the commissioner's computers,

18:25.846 --> 18:26.913
and I even refragged
their registries.

18:26.947 --> 18:28.281
You know, most people think

18:28.315 --> 18:30.684
refragging is a big waste
of time. Lieutenant.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.186
What'd Dr. morales have to say?

18:33.220 --> 18:35.121
Commissioner had
no defensive marks.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.923
No sexual assault.

18:36.957 --> 18:39.325
And the cut on her neck
definitely happened postmortem.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.894
See, I... That's the part
I don't understand.

18:40.928 --> 18:42.929
Why do you cut the throat of
someone you just murdered?

18:42.963 --> 18:44.664
It's a symbolic
gesture of some kind.

18:44.699 --> 18:46.299
Just don't know what it means yet.

18:47.702 --> 18:48.735
Yes, lieutenant?

18:48.769 --> 18:50.403
Are you gonna eat that crust?

18:51.619 --> 18:52.439
Yes, I am.

18:56.139 --> 18:56.743
Okay.

18:56.777 --> 18:59.913
Uh, in the 20 years that
he's been at folsom,

18:59.947 --> 19:02.082
Tomas Medina has only had one
visitor... his grandmother.

19:02.116 --> 19:04.117
And that was about 17 months ago.

19:04.151 --> 19:06.186
Here's his record and
a complete transcript

19:06.220 --> 19:08.154
of the hearing before
commissioner Ross.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.489
What about phone calls?

19:09.523 --> 19:10.790
Zero. Incoming or outgoing.

19:10.825 --> 19:13.760
Um, could you please... Phone.

19:15.501 --> 19:16.996
Thank you.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.434
Deputy chief Johnson.

19:21.469 --> 19:22.769
Where are you?

19:22.803 --> 19:24.137
Is that chief Johnson?

19:24.171 --> 19:26.539
My proctologist.
You need something?

19:26.574 --> 19:28.675
No, no. I just...

19:28.709 --> 19:31.010
You're asking where
your proctologist is?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.212
Yes.

19:32.246 --> 19:34.581
I hate it when he surprises me.

19:37.284 --> 19:39.986
Chief... Chief, Medina is here.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.988
What?! He wasn't supposed to arrive

19:42.022 --> 19:43.843
for another two hours at least.

19:43.844 --> 19:45.425
Well, air support had
a cancelled pick-up,

19:45.459 --> 19:48.194
and so Medina was
flown in directly.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.524
And Pope is not happy that our
suspect is here and you're not.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.000
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
tell him I'm on my way.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.722
Let's go.

19:56.537 --> 19:58.058
C-can I have that?

19:58.973 --> 20:00.132
Yes.

20:08.525 --> 20:11.391
And now my guy gives
you pictures of ***

20:11.392 --> 20:12.634
All right, here we go, everyone.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.292
Do you realize how long you've
kept everyone waiting here?

20:15.326 --> 20:16.426
Before I start asking questions,

20:16.461 --> 20:17.728
I need to know at least
some of the answers

20:17.762 --> 20:19.296
or we'll never get anywhere.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.832
Chief, I have Sanchez bringing
medina up from holding.

20:21.866 --> 20:23.233
Uh, where do you want him?

20:23.268 --> 20:24.468
Hard interview 1.

20:24.502 --> 20:27.037
No. I'd prefer to
question Mr. Medina

20:27.071 --> 20:28.939
in one of my interview rooms.

20:28.973 --> 20:30.941
It's less intimidating.
He's been in folsom for quite a while.

20:30.975 --> 20:32.142
I think he expects
some intimidation.

20:32.177 --> 20:33.811
And you're missing the point here.

20:33.845 --> 20:35.612
We're not doing this
interrogation to prove

20:35.647 --> 20:37.915
Buzz...That he committed the murder,
but to show the likelihood

20:37.949 --> 20:39.750
that commissioner Ross'
death was not the beginning

20:39.784 --> 20:42.419
of a string of attacks against
the whole parole board.

20:42.453 --> 20:43.987
Well, you may not need a confession,
but I certainly do.

20:44.022 --> 20:47.057
The guy's in prison for life.
What more are you gonna do to him?

20:47.091 --> 20:49.326
And why are these screens
still not working?

20:49.360 --> 20:50.561
That's not my fault.

20:50.595 --> 20:51.585
Bank fraud's projector is keyed

20:51.586 --> 20:52.844
to the same remote signal as ours.

20:52.845 --> 20:56.366
All right, just... Just get it fixed,
please? Thank you.

20:56.401 --> 20:59.169
Here. We may need to communicate
during the interview

20:59.204 --> 21:00.571
in case there are questions.

21:00.605 --> 21:02.406
From whom? From me!

21:02.440 --> 21:05.909
Put in the earpiece, and let's
hear what Medina has to say.

21:13.710 --> 21:16.286
Buzz, are we all set?
Speakers? Volume?

21:16.321 --> 21:19.790
We'll know as soon as
they start talking, chief.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.468
Mr. Medina, I'm deputy
chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

21:26.469 --> 21:28.198
This is Detective Gabriel.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.366
I hope you enjoyed that hamburger.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.487
There's another one coming for you

21:30.488 --> 21:32.229
just as soon as we're done here.

21:32.230 --> 21:35.205
We just have a few questions for you.
It shouldn't take too long.

21:36.102 --> 21:37.271
I got nowhere to be.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.343
You can ask me anything you want.

21:39.377 --> 21:41.144
Good. What, if anything,

21:41.179 --> 21:44.348
can you tell us about
commissioner Danielle Ross?

21:45.704 --> 21:47.751
I can tell you she's dead.

21:48.539 --> 21:50.520
And how did you hear about that?

21:50.906 --> 21:52.689
Good news travels fast.

21:52.724 --> 21:53.991
Does it?

21:57.629 --> 21:59.730
When someone like Ross gets offed,

21:59.764 --> 22:00.704
yeah, it does.

22:00.705 --> 22:02.289
Even the xx talks about it

22:02.290 --> 22:05.302
I take it you weren't one
of commissioner Ross' fans.

22:05.336 --> 22:08.521
That black bitch passed me
up for parole three times.

22:08.522 --> 22:11.555
Maybe it's because she didn't
like being called a black bitch.

22:12.557 --> 22:14.478
Yeah, well, she's dead and I'm not.

22:14.512 --> 22:15.913
So who has the final
word on that, huh?

22:15.947 --> 22:17.481
Just because I'm in lock-up

22:17.515 --> 22:20.017
doesn't mean that I don't
have people on the outside

22:20.051 --> 22:21.318
who care about me.

22:21.352 --> 22:24.021
Get in my way, somebody moves you.

22:24.055 --> 22:25.017
He's all but admitting it.

22:25.018 --> 22:27.472
Tell chief Johnson
to cut to the chase.

22:30.128 --> 22:32.763
Chief Johnson, let's, uh...

22:32.797 --> 22:34.131
Let's get to the point here.

22:34.165 --> 22:36.934
And these people on the
outside who care about you...

22:36.968 --> 22:38.635
Are any of them a girlfriend?

22:39.241 --> 22:41.238
You looking for a conjugal, mija?

22:41.272 --> 22:43.140
Hey! Watch your mouth, sir!

22:43.174 --> 22:44.741
Sir?

22:44.776 --> 22:46.009
Keep that up,

22:46.044 --> 22:48.312
I'll have you drive me
back to the airport, boy.

22:53.851 --> 22:57.487
I wouldn't call any
of them my girlfriend,

22:57.522 --> 22:59.423
but, uh, I do all right.

22:59.424 --> 23:02.926
And when, exactly,
do you "do all right," Mr. Medina?

23:02.961 --> 23:05.095
Because according to
the people at folsom,

23:05.129 --> 23:06.988
you haven't had a visitor
or even a phone call

23:06.989 --> 23:08.565
in over a year.

23:09.332 --> 23:11.614
So, maybe the people
you do all right with

23:11.615 --> 23:13.470
are the men in prison with you.

23:14.710 --> 23:18.809
Well, obviously I have a little
army on the outside, boy.

23:18.843 --> 23:20.877
Yeah, well, a man who hires
a guy to kill his wife

23:20.912 --> 23:23.534
and then rats that guy out
usually isn't too popular.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.082
Detective Gabriel's
right about that.

23:25.116 --> 23:27.517
You might not be as popular
with the people at folsom

23:27.552 --> 23:29.619
as you think you are.

23:29.654 --> 23:32.589
You want to know how to
make friends in prison?

23:32.623 --> 23:36.259
You get rid of the black bitch
who's keeping us all in there.

23:36.294 --> 23:40.364
You see, whoever does that
gets loads of respect.

23:40.927 --> 23:41.798
All right, he's almost there.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.834
Let's ask him something concrete,

23:43.868 --> 23:46.803
like, uh, does he know
commissioner Ross' address.

23:50.477 --> 23:53.840
Mr. Medina, do you know where
commissioner Ross lives?

23:56.014 --> 23:57.414
Yeah, sure.

23:57.448 --> 24:00.817
She used to invite me over for
Sunday roast every weekend.

24:00.852 --> 24:02.452
Is this your first time doing this?

24:02.487 --> 24:04.087
Do you really think
I'm stupid enough

24:04.122 --> 24:06.423
to say that I killed her to you?

24:06.457 --> 24:07.668
Or to them?

24:07.669 --> 24:09.724
No, Mr. Medina.
I don't think you're stupid.

24:09.725 --> 24:10.902
But I also don't think you had

24:10.903 --> 24:12.752
anything to do with the
commissioner's murder.

24:13.168 --> 24:15.604
What is she saying?
Why are you saying that?

24:15.605 --> 24:18.809
However, since good
news does travel fast,

24:18.810 --> 24:20.674
I have a feeling you
may already know

24:20.675 --> 24:22.765
who is responsible for her death.

24:22.766 --> 24:24.261
And if you were to help
me figure that out,

24:24.262 --> 24:26.606
I could end up getting
your sentence reduced.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.449
That's a... that's a commonly
used negotiating tactic.

24:30.450 --> 24:32.139
No promises have been made.

24:32.140 --> 24:33.987
I guarantee it.

24:34.652 --> 24:36.086
That's not a promise.

24:36.120 --> 24:36.924
You know what would happen

24:36.925 --> 24:39.459
if anybody found out I
was talking to the cops?

24:39.460 --> 24:42.893
I don't kiss and tell, Mr. Medina.
Nobody...

24:42.894 --> 24:44.692
Don't say nobody will find out

24:44.693 --> 24:47.463
because somebody always does!

24:48.023 --> 24:49.600
And the deals you people make...

24:49.601 --> 24:51.368
You know, I actually
fell for it once.

24:51.369 --> 24:54.055
Yeah, eligible for
parole in 17 years.

24:54.056 --> 24:55.703
I'm in two decades already,

24:55.704 --> 24:58.257
and I'm starting to figure
out that it's all bullshit!

24:58.576 --> 24:59.723
You know what?

24:59.843 --> 25:02.162
You people never let me out of here

25:02.163 --> 25:03.971
instead, you're just
filling up the streets

25:03.972 --> 25:05.899
with all those freaks. What freaks?

25:05.900 --> 25:08.155
The crackheads,
the perverts, the thieves

25:08.156 --> 25:09.052
that you're letting out of prison

25:09.087 --> 25:11.282
because the state ran out
of money to keep them there.

25:11.283 --> 25:13.824
You know what?
If I had just beaten my wife

25:13.858 --> 25:15.588
instead of having some idiot
shoot her in the head,

25:15.589 --> 25:17.326
I'd be a free man today.

25:28.673 --> 25:30.440
You did everything but
curtsy to the guy.

25:30.475 --> 25:32.075
Then you offer him
a reduced sentence.

25:32.110 --> 25:33.559
Did you not just hear Medina say

25:33.560 --> 25:36.759
that he could have hired someone
to kill commissioner Ross?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.882
His little army all the freaks

25:38.916 --> 25:41.184
the early-release program
lets out onto the streets.

25:41.219 --> 25:43.253
The early-release program
is for nonviolent prisoners,

25:43.287 --> 25:44.097
not murderers.

25:44.098 --> 25:45.290
But the fact that
they're nonviolent

25:45.291 --> 25:47.113
only supports the theory

25:47.114 --> 25:48.876
that the commissioner's
murder was carried out

25:48.877 --> 25:52.237
by an amateur Mr. Medina
hired from inside prison.

25:52.238 --> 25:53.631
Why do you say "amateur"?

25:53.632 --> 25:55.711
Because an experienced killer
would never have waited

25:55.712 --> 25:57.991
for commissioner Ross
inside of her house.

25:57.992 --> 25:59.649
Or vandalize her car

25:59.650 --> 26:01.963
or break into her
house a second time.

26:03.226 --> 26:04.641
Leave a box cutter behind,

26:04.642 --> 26:06.611
spray gardenia perfume everywhere.

26:07.219 --> 26:10.356
And Medina used an
amateur to kill his wife.

26:10.357 --> 26:12.278
So, that's his m.O.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.177
So, can you at least
just go back in there

26:15.178 --> 26:16.721
and get him to tell
us some of that?

26:16.722 --> 26:18.627
I could probably get him to
say almost anything right now

26:18.628 --> 26:20.957
if I offered him a milkshake
and a side of fries.

26:21.822 --> 26:23.713
Yeah, but what if
we arrest Medina now

26:23.714 --> 26:26.574
and two days later,
your worst fears come true

26:26.575 --> 26:28.401
and another commissioner
is shot to death?

26:28.402 --> 26:31.498
Where will operation:swift justice be then?

26:33.565 --> 26:36.580
Oh, I forgot.
It's your investigation.

26:36.581 --> 26:38.054
I'll do whatever you want.

26:51.789 --> 26:53.178
Heaven's sakes!

27:02.745 --> 27:04.182
Chief, where are you taking us?

27:05.429 --> 27:08.551
Chief Pope commandeered our offices,
so we're gonna use his.

27:08.552 --> 27:10.870
While he's looking at people
who were in jail last night,

27:10.871 --> 27:12.416
we may find someone

27:12.417 --> 27:15.362
who was actually available
to commit the crime.

27:16.825 --> 27:20.148
Oh! Why can't I ever find
that ridiculous keycard?

27:20.149 --> 27:20.909
Oh. Oh, wait.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.503
Here. Here, chief. Try this one.

27:22.504 --> 27:25.441
Oh, thank you. Well, don't thank me.
It's Flynn's card.

27:25.442 --> 27:27.802
W-what are you doing with my card?
I lost mine, okay?

27:27.803 --> 27:29.172
You went through my desk?

27:29.884 --> 27:30.708
Uh, uh, chief...

27:31.812 --> 27:33.789
I'll, uh...I'll take
care of Pope's secretary.

27:33.790 --> 27:35.309
She's sweet on me.

27:36.087 --> 27:37.117
Oh, hi, Linda.

27:37.118 --> 27:38.541
Um, chief Pope suggested

27:38.542 --> 27:40.414
that we use his
conference room for a bit.

27:40.957 --> 27:43.591
Uh, we won't be long.
It's all right? Okay? Yeah?

27:56.928 --> 27:59.514
Well, I'm beginning
to get discouraged.

28:00.044 --> 28:02.804
Should we include
unidentified sharp objects?

28:04.341 --> 28:06.182
Tao might have something, chief.

28:07.449 --> 28:09.917
It's not exactly right, but...

28:09.951 --> 28:11.885
Richard Conway.
Convicted of drug possession.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.386
Served 20 months
before being let out

28:13.387 --> 28:15.363
on the early-release program.

28:15.364 --> 28:17.091
Two days after his release,

28:17.092 --> 28:19.995
Conway killed 32-year-old
white male... Scott Weber...

28:19.996 --> 28:21.252
at an atm downtown.

28:21.253 --> 28:22.861
Cut his throat with a box cutter.

28:22.862 --> 28:26.077
Chief. Check out the
crime-scene photo.

28:26.078 --> 28:27.380
Look familiar?

28:27.381 --> 28:29.087
A little too familiar.

28:32.874 --> 28:35.747
But Mr. Conway was
arrested 12 hours later.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.077
He confessed to the murder.

28:37.078 --> 28:39.189
So he's got the same
alibi as Mr. Medina.

28:39.190 --> 28:41.166
He's in jail now!

28:41.167 --> 28:42.367
There's this. Look.

28:42.368 --> 28:44.904
Commissioner Ross signed
his conditions of parole.

28:44.905 --> 28:48.121
Gabriel, this guy
was in the lock-up

28:48.122 --> 28:49.514
when the commissioner was murdered.

28:49.515 --> 28:52.163
Y-you think he broke out of
jail to kill the commissioner,

28:52.164 --> 28:54.915
then he broke back in
jail and nobody noticed?

28:54.916 --> 28:56.501
Detective Verico
said that he thought

28:56.502 --> 28:58.470
commissioner Ross' stalker
might have been a woman.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.196
So, what if this Conway guy...

29:00.197 --> 29:01.997
What if he had a girlfriend?
Or a wife?

29:04.939 --> 29:07.779
Would it really hurt to bring
him in for questioning?

29:10.245 --> 29:11.512
Well, it's either that

29:11.546 --> 29:13.701
or we go back to operation:
Swift justice.

29:13.702 --> 29:14.901
No. No. No. No.

29:14.902 --> 29:17.149
God, no. Anything but that.
Yes, bring him in.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.093
Thank you. Thanks, chief.

29:19.094 --> 29:21.670
Hey, Gabriel, when you question this guy,
remember to ask him

29:21.671 --> 29:24.311
how he got in and out of
commissioner Ross' house

29:24.312 --> 29:27.233
with all the windows barred
and all the doors locked.

29:27.234 --> 29:29.116
Think I figured that out already.

29:35.421 --> 29:38.075
Um, I never t-thought
it would come to this.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.542
You know, killing someone
for a little rock.

29:40.543 --> 29:44.049
Addiction is a terrible thing,
Mr. Conway.

29:44.805 --> 29:46.847
Did you have anyone
to talk to about it?

29:46.848 --> 29:48.944
A wife or... or girlfriend, maybe?

29:48.945 --> 29:49.991
No.

29:50.488 --> 29:52.498
But even if I had,
it wouldn't matter.

29:53.338 --> 29:55.402
When I need it, I-I-I need it.

29:55.403 --> 29:59.405
And that night... I needed it.

30:00.374 --> 30:01.759
So when you saw Mr. Weber

30:01.760 --> 30:03.478
at the bank machine, you thought,

30:03.479 --> 30:05.786
"here's where I can get
the cash to buy my drugs."

30:05.787 --> 30:06.770
Yeah.

30:06.771 --> 30:10.771
Yeah, so I-I got out of -
out of this pickup that I stole,

30:10.772 --> 30:12.990
and I went through the bed,
and there...

30:12.991 --> 30:14.197
There was this toolbox.

30:14.198 --> 30:15.816
That's where you
found the box cutter.

30:16.888 --> 30:17.858
Yeah.

30:18.592 --> 30:20.424
The guy thought I was joking.

30:20.425 --> 30:22.843
He told me to take off or
he would call the cops.

30:23.884 --> 30:27.525
But I-I needed that money.

30:29.199 --> 30:32.215
And when he wouldn't hand it over?

30:37.337 --> 30:39.873
I-I cut his throat.

30:40.575 --> 30:43.425
And I left him there at the atm.

30:44.881 --> 30:50.561
I-I took him f-from his
wife and his f-family

30:50.562 --> 30:53.412
f-for 40... $40.

30:57.435 --> 30:59.901
But they should have never
let me out of prison.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.260
'Cause I-I said so in court.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.493
I told them,
"I'm only gonna get high, man."

31:04.494 --> 31:06.628
But they didn't care.
They didn't care at all.

31:07.094 --> 31:09.158
If... If they hadn't paroled me,

31:09.556 --> 31:11.431
it would have never happened.

31:13.744 --> 31:16.009
Killing that guy was not my fault.

31:16.010 --> 31:17.772
Everyone else hated
commissioner Ross

31:17.773 --> 31:19.429
because she kept them in prison.

31:19.430 --> 31:21.566
This moron hates her
because she let him out.

31:21.567 --> 31:22.913
Can you believe it?

31:28.380 --> 31:30.763
I'm sorry, Detective.
I-I think we're done here.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.570
Thank you so much, sir.

31:35.778 --> 31:36.706
Wait.

31:39.121 --> 31:41.546
I-I h-hate to ask this.

31:41.547 --> 31:43.900
But could you...

31:43.901 --> 31:46.195
Could you tell her that I'm sorry?

31:47.565 --> 31:49.100
Tell who you're sorry?

31:49.877 --> 31:51.647
The guy's wife.

31:52.409 --> 31:56.715
Could you tell her,
um... I-I was out of control?

31:57.453 --> 32:01.094
And... that I'm, uh, sorry?

32:10.952 --> 32:12.312
Ann Weber?

32:12.313 --> 32:13.571
Yes?

32:14.124 --> 32:15.743
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson

32:15.744 --> 32:17.463
of the L.A.P.D. Major Crimes.

32:17.464 --> 32:19.274
Thank you so much
for coming in today.

32:19.275 --> 32:21.826
I've got an apology
to pass along to you.

32:21.827 --> 32:25.125
I-is there more bad news?
I'm afraid so.

32:25.126 --> 32:27.495
But I should probably let
the Detective in charge

32:27.496 --> 32:29.023
explain it all to you.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.136
By the way, that is a lovely
perfume you're wearing.

32:32.137 --> 32:33.576
Reminds me of home.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.946
A flower, I think?

32:36.547 --> 32:37.668
G-gardenia.

32:37.996 --> 32:40.573
Yes, gardenia. I thought so.

32:42.110 --> 32:43.981
Ma'am, I'm Detective David Gabriel.

32:43.982 --> 32:45.183
I'm one of the original officers

32:45.184 --> 32:47.025
who investigated your
husband's murder.

32:47.860 --> 32:48.827
Um, I just want to say

32:48.828 --> 32:51.545
that we're really
sorry about all this.

32:51.546 --> 32:53.700
Sorry about what?

32:54.455 --> 32:55.584
What's wrong?

32:55.585 --> 32:57.216
Well, as it turns out, Mrs. Weber,

32:57.217 --> 32:59.848
the man who we arrested for
murdering your husband...

32:59.849 --> 33:01.547
He is innocent.

33:08.616 --> 33:10.551
No. That's...

33:10.585 --> 33:11.952
That's not possible.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.080
I'm afraid it is.

33:13.081 --> 33:14.468
Ma'am, you see, the blood

33:14.469 --> 33:16.629
that we found on Mr. Conway's clothes,

33:16.630 --> 33:19.293
it does not match up to
that of your husband.

33:27.068 --> 33:28.101
No!

33:28.136 --> 33:29.503
Oh, my goodness!

33:29.537 --> 33:30.904
Hold on. Hold on.

33:32.473 --> 33:35.542
Okay. Okay, Mrs. Weber. Hold on.

33:35.577 --> 33:39.012
Detective Sanchez, would you get
her a glass of water, please?

33:39.047 --> 33:43.363
Mrs. Weber, I-I know that
this is just terrible news.

33:43.364 --> 33:44.878
But... but I promise you

33:44.879 --> 33:47.871
that the L.A.P.D.
Is doing everything that we can,

33:47.872 --> 33:51.124
even as we speak,
to find the real killer.

33:51.659 --> 33:54.101
But he... he confessed.

33:55.229 --> 33:58.632
How could he confess to
something he... he didn't do?

33:58.666 --> 34:00.200
He was so high when the
police picked him up,

34:00.234 --> 34:01.668
he would have admitted to anything.

34:09.243 --> 34:11.178
Mrs. Weber?

34:13.306 --> 34:15.282
She's going into shock, chief.

34:15.315 --> 34:19.493
I'm fine. I just need to lie down.

34:20.054 --> 34:23.389
Well, the least we can
do is drive you home.

34:23.476 --> 34:25.125
Where's your car?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.360
Detective Sanchez,
why don't you follow us?

34:27.829 --> 34:30.163
Want to show us where
your car is, Mrs. Weber?

34:30.197 --> 34:34.735
Why don't we head on down
to the garage right now?

34:44.178 --> 34:45.650
Mrs. Weber, we're really sorry

34:45.650 --> 34:48.560
about how long it's taken us
to figure out our mistake.

34:49.627 --> 34:52.552
But Conway said he did it.

34:52.587 --> 34:57.157
Unfortunately, Mr. Conway was
hospitalized for an overdose

34:57.191 --> 34:59.096
during the time of
your husband's murder.

35:02.463 --> 35:03.997
Oh, my goodness.

35:04.465 --> 35:06.120
Is that a roadblock?

35:06.434 --> 35:09.025
We're having trouble getting
you home, Mrs. Weber.

35:09.026 --> 35:11.609
The president's in town.
There's lots of detours.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.971
I'll try another route.
Let's go this way here.

35:27.455 --> 35:30.785
Do you guys have any idea
who the killer really is?

35:30.786 --> 35:33.226
Oh, well, we believe so.
Yes, ma'am.

35:33.261 --> 35:37.431
Who? Who killed my Scott?

35:37.465 --> 35:40.400
We're looking for someone
much smarter than Mr. Conway.

35:40.435 --> 35:43.981
We're dealing with obsession here,
a real stalker.

35:44.572 --> 35:46.573
Oh, my God.

35:46.607 --> 35:47.616
You're scaring me.

35:47.617 --> 35:49.858
Oh, don't be frightened,
Mrs. Weber.

35:49.859 --> 35:52.397
We're very close to an arrest,
I promise you.

35:54.248 --> 35:57.444
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Another roadblock?

36:29.817 --> 36:31.830
I thought you were taking me home.

36:32.420 --> 36:33.720
Where are we?

36:33.755 --> 36:35.830
You know very well where we are.

36:36.257 --> 36:38.887
Um, I-I've never been here before.

36:38.888 --> 36:41.683
Oh, yes, you have, Mrs. Weber.

36:42.296 --> 36:45.098
Your perfume hung around
long after your first visit.

36:45.133 --> 36:47.634
And you accomplished a
pretty neat trick, too.

36:47.668 --> 36:48.617
Getting inside this house

36:48.618 --> 36:50.137
and leaving it all
locked up behind you.

36:50.171 --> 36:52.439
I kept trying to figure out how
someone could have managed that

36:52.473 --> 36:53.807
when I should have been wondering

36:53.841 --> 36:56.426
why someone would break
into commissioner Ross' car

36:56.427 --> 36:57.956
and not steal anything.

36:57.957 --> 37:00.227
But you did steal something,
didn't you?

37:00.228 --> 37:02.556
I.D. Cards open
everything these days.

37:02.557 --> 37:04.525
Signals move things up and down.

37:04.526 --> 37:08.221
And I'm taking a chance
here that this...

37:12.894 --> 37:14.668
...opens a garage.

37:30.545 --> 37:32.946
You broke into
commissioner Ross' vehicle

37:32.980 --> 37:35.282
and you used her garage-door opener

37:35.316 --> 37:37.317
to reprogram the one
in your own car.

37:37.351 --> 37:40.220
Then you used that signal to break
into her house and kill her!

37:40.254 --> 37:42.455
Ann Weber, you have the
right to remain silent.

37:42.490 --> 37:43.020
Anything you say

37:43.021 --> 37:44.964
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

37:44.965 --> 37:46.237
You have the right to an attorney.

37:46.238 --> 37:47.125
If you can't afford one,

37:47.126 --> 37:48.727
one will be appointed
for you by the state.

37:48.728 --> 37:50.640
Have you heard and understood
these rights, ma'am?

37:51.233 --> 37:53.641
Oh, my God. How many times?

37:53.642 --> 37:56.040
How many times did you come
back here before you found

37:56.041 --> 37:58.019
the door from the garage
to the house unlocked, huh?

37:58.020 --> 38:00.587
Once? Three times? Eight times?

38:01.862 --> 38:04.606
She never had that door locked.

38:05.104 --> 38:06.200
Ever.

38:07.041 --> 38:09.404
I could just come
and go as I wanted.

38:10.562 --> 38:13.115
And then one day, I found her gun.

38:13.605 --> 38:14.949
And I took it.

38:14.950 --> 38:16.261
And the box cutter?

38:16.262 --> 38:17.989
I only had the box cutter

38:17.990 --> 38:22.214
to show her how that
maniac killed my husband!

38:23.152 --> 38:25.526
The one that I thought she
let out on the street.

38:26.055 --> 38:28.591
The so-called nonviolent offender.

38:31.235 --> 38:34.310
How could you have arrested him?!

38:34.947 --> 38:38.228
How could you have made
such an awful mistake?!

38:38.754 --> 38:39.880
We didn't.

38:41.616 --> 38:42.398
What?

38:42.399 --> 38:44.394
We didn't make a mistake.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.559
Richard Conway
murdered your husband

38:46.560 --> 38:48.338
just like you thought he did.

38:48.892 --> 38:51.164
You do understand, Mrs. Weber,

38:51.165 --> 38:52.740
that the early-release program

38:52.741 --> 38:54.691
was not commissioner Ross' idea.

38:54.692 --> 38:57.733
All she did was sign the papers
the state put in front of her.

38:57.734 --> 38:58.704
Letting Conway out...

38:58.705 --> 39:01.118
She had nothing... nothing -
to do with that.

39:01.119 --> 39:04.257
Yeah, well, she went along with that!
Isn't it obvious?!

39:04.258 --> 39:06.584
What's obvious is
that you're a lunatic

39:06.585 --> 39:08.351
who's under arrest for murder.

39:08.352 --> 39:09.618
And on the subject

39:09.619 --> 39:11.952
of early-release for
nonviolent offenders?

39:11.953 --> 39:14.460
I'm afraid that that's a
policy that won't apply to you.

39:14.918 --> 39:17.095
In fact, I-I don't think
that your parole hearings

39:17.096 --> 39:18.753
are gonna go very well at all.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.213
Lieutenant Flynn...

39:21.718 --> 39:23.286
Ann Weber, you're under arrest

39:23.287 --> 39:25.432
for the murder of Danielle Ross.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.121
This w way, ma'am.

39:51.193 --> 39:54.561
Detective Verico, I think, uh...

39:55.557 --> 39:58.543
It's unfortunate that my
concern about this murder

39:58.544 --> 39:59.858
led me to...

40:01.412 --> 40:03.220
Inadvertently hold you responsible

40:03.221 --> 40:05.136
for what happened to
commissioner Ross.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.014
That's the best you can do?

40:11.904 --> 40:13.682
I don't know how
to respond to that.

40:14.091 --> 40:15.451
I'm not surprised.

40:16.388 --> 40:18.902
Mind if I go back to work, sir?

40:19.489 --> 40:22.034
Please do. Thanks.

40:24.419 --> 40:25.758
And, chief Johnson...

40:28.939 --> 40:29.712
...Good luck.

40:29.713 --> 40:31.960
Thank you, Detective. You too.

40:33.419 --> 40:34.657
Good night.

40:37.003 --> 40:38.205
I hate to say this, will,

40:38.206 --> 40:40.454
but this whole
chief-selection process?

40:40.455 --> 40:42.526
It has not brought
out the best in you.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.808
And if this is how you
intend to run the department,

40:44.809 --> 40:46.921
I'm not even sure it's
a job you should have.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.898
Well, you think you
could do better?

40:49.321 --> 40:51.617
I'd be really disappointed
if I couldn't.

41:03.281 --> 41:05.498
Brenda, you... you -
you cannot imagine

41:05.499 --> 41:07.082
the... the kind of pressure

41:07.083 --> 41:10.533
I've been under here for
the last...few months.

41:10.856 --> 41:12.560
Half-dismantling Metro division.

41:12.561 --> 41:15.785
Putting experienced
detectives back out on patrol.

41:15.786 --> 41:18.832
Scrambling to keep our
guys on the streets.

41:18.833 --> 41:21.969
However it may look from
where you're sitting,

41:21.970 --> 41:26.209
I...I'm doing my best
to protect the L.A.P.D.

41:27.372 --> 41:29.001
I really am.

41:31.425 --> 41:33.336
Still no apology.
