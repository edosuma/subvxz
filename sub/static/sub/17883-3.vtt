WEBVTT

00:01.115 --> 00:03.222
Yeah, I have a stamp
from, like, every state...

00:03.223 --> 00:05.605
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.557
- Colorado, Connecticut...
- Ricky, can you mail this or not?

00:07.558 --> 00:09.059
Delaware, Florida,
Georgia...

00:09.060 --> 00:10.943
Sorry, Borten.
We've got a serious situation.

00:10.945 --> 00:11.979
Oh. Indiana...

00:11.980 --> 00:13.363
And now you're out of it.

00:13.364 --> 00:16.450
Cameron with the rescue.
Saved me from the Bortex.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.535
Oh, the bumping of fists...

00:18.536 --> 00:20.037
Universal sign
of not getting any.

00:20.038 --> 00:21.238
How'd she feel?
Was she gentle?

00:21.239 --> 00:23.206
- Shut up. I have...
- No clue what you're doing.

00:23.207 --> 00:24.207
Oh, this from the guy...

00:24.208 --> 00:25.459
Who thinks you have no game.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.877
Yes, I...
Suck.

00:26.878 --> 00:29.413
Look, I've told you before...
Melanie's an ice road trucker

00:29.414 --> 00:31.665
trapped inside the body
of a telemundo weather girl.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.750
With a woman like that,
you gotta go <i>big...</i>

00:33.751 --> 00:34.968
Epic gesture big.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.503
And I've told <i>you</i> before...

00:36.504 --> 00:39.589
I'm not projecting her face
on the moon like the bat signal.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.381
Terrible idea. The craters
made her face look like machete.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.983
Just stay out of it.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.986
<i>Hola.</i>
Hide the bong. Mother's home.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.354
Veronica. How are you?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.323
Ooh. How was Boston?

00:56.324 --> 00:58.658
Ooh. How... how's, uh,
how's your daughter?

00:58.659 --> 01:00.660
My kid? Are you kidding me?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.946
Fantastic.
Chip off the old block.

01:02.947 --> 01:05.415
I, on the other hand,
won't be picking my own lobster

01:05.416 --> 01:08.418
out of the tank again
anytime soon. Ow.

01:08.419 --> 01:11.455
But I didn't forget about
my office fam. No, I did not.

01:11.456 --> 01:13.090
Hey, who's in the mood

01:13.091 --> 01:15.208
for a little authentic
new England clam cho...

01:15.209 --> 01:17.460
Okay,
that did not travel well.

01:17.461 --> 01:18.762
Dibs.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.585
All right, kiddies.
Lace up your gloves.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.220
It is clobberin' time.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.806
Yeah! Clobberin' time! Whoo!
I don't know what that is.

01:29.807 --> 01:31.274
Moving right along,

01:31.275 --> 01:33.527
I just got off the phone
with Billy Lumberg from Initech.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.813
They're taking some heat
in the form of a hack attack.

01:36.814 --> 01:38.398
Their office lights
aren't malfunctioning.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.283
They've been turned
into a video game.

01:40.284 --> 01:42.944
Oh, my eyes just had sex.

01:42.945 --> 01:44.404
Wait, his call sign
is "Rembrandt"?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.488
I think I've heard
of this guy.

01:45.489 --> 01:47.198
Who are these "hackers," anyway?

01:47.199 --> 01:48.875
Sad, lonely, pathetic virgins

01:48.876 --> 01:51.244
who don't have anything better
to do with their time?

01:51.245 --> 01:54.781
What? No. That's just
a cruel stereotype.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.249
There's no evidence
that supports that.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.876
I mean, sure,
anecdotal evidence, but...

01:57.877 --> 02:01.121
Uh-oh. My crush-o-meter
has been activated.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.141
What?

02:04.142 --> 02:06.468
Boop, boop!

02:06.469 --> 02:08.812
- It's such a treat to have you back.
- Thank you.

02:08.812 --> 02:11.231
All right, so let's go catch
a hacker. What do you say? Huh?

02:11.232 --> 02:13.316
Cammy, this job has your name
written in its undies.

02:13.317 --> 02:14.484
Do whatever it takes.

02:14.485 --> 02:16.153
If I may interject,

02:16.154 --> 02:19.856
do catch the hacker,
but not do "whatever it takes."

02:19.857 --> 02:21.825
And the bad news
in three, two...

02:21.826 --> 02:25.111
O.C.P. has mandated that each
new job will now be monitored

02:25.112 --> 02:27.072
by a protocol officer.

02:27.073 --> 02:29.616
"A protocol officer"?
That's bull.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.119
I don't need a babysitter.
I'm a grown-ass man.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.209
Who... who's the officer?

02:39.210 --> 02:40.827
Oh, what?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.170
Oh, come on.

02:42.171 --> 02:43.338
Why?

02:43.339 --> 02:45.932
This... is a complete list

02:45.933 --> 02:47.884
of all the lawsuits
brought against contra

02:47.885 --> 02:50.387
in the past year.
It's quite a hefty file.

02:50.388 --> 02:52.522
Yeah. I let her
carry it around.

02:52.523 --> 02:54.533
Otherwise, I might get those great,
big, crazy Madonna arms.

02:54.534 --> 02:57.644
Hey, hey, hey. Half of these
lawsuits are completely frivolous.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.480
Yes. And the other half?
I mean, look at this.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.607
We have
"destruction of property,"

03:02.608 --> 03:05.986
"invasion of privacy"...
Oh, and my personal favorite,

03:05.987 --> 03:08.738
"trading with the enemy."
Mm.

03:08.739 --> 03:11.791
Hey. Fidel.
<i>Como estas,</i> you wild man?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.743
Really appreciate
the fine Cubans you sent,

03:13.744 --> 03:16.454
but I was sort of talking
about cigars.

03:16.455 --> 03:19.999
In summary, let's go get
that hooligan Rembrandt

03:20.000 --> 03:21.534
whilst staying within the law.

03:23.921 --> 03:25.964
I'll allow it.

03:25.965 --> 03:28.041

03:34.221 --> 03:35.557
"He'll allow it"?

03:35.755 --> 03:37.597
He's not the one
driving around blind all night,

03:37.598 --> 03:38.932
looking for a wireless signal.

03:38.933 --> 03:42.594
Blind? Son, this is
the cash I-g-88 antenna.

03:42.595 --> 03:45.055
This bad boy'll
pick up Rembrandt's signal

03:45.056 --> 03:48.058
from anywhere in the city
and steer you right to him.

03:48.059 --> 03:49.559
All right,
I guess I owe you one.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.311
Now actually, you owe me two.

03:51.312 --> 03:52.841
So follow me,
'cause the second one is

03:52.842 --> 03:54.948
much more epic than the...
First one.

03:54.949 --> 03:56.266
When you sing
like that, it makes me very...

03:56.267 --> 03:57.275
Nervous.

03:57.276 --> 03:59.527
Behold...

03:59.528 --> 04:01.338
Your new epic gesture
for Melanie.

04:01.339 --> 04:04.741
Cash! I said no!
How did you even do this?

04:04.742 --> 04:07.619
And why is she giving
the thumbs up?

04:07.620 --> 04:10.714
Hey, Mel. Still up for
teaching me how to drive stick?

04:10.715 --> 04:12.249
Anytime.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.334
<i>Commence body scan now.</i>

04:14.335 --> 04:15.502
Yes.

04:15.503 --> 04:17.671
That's very thorough.

04:17.672 --> 04:21.341
It's quite simply...
My ass-terpiece.

04:21.341 --> 04:22.801
'Sup, guys?

04:22.802 --> 04:26.429
What the hell? Is that...
Is that supposed to be me?

04:26.430 --> 04:29.557
Melanie, meet Metalnie.

04:29.558 --> 04:31.226
Cameron's been
working on it for weeks.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.270
"Metalnie"?
You made a metal me?

04:34.271 --> 04:36.439
No, cash made it for me.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.325
I mean, he made it
for me to give to...

04:38.326 --> 04:40.310
No, that didn't come out right.
Okay, he made it...

04:40.311 --> 04:42.812
Why did anyone make it?
Cam, what did you think,

04:42.813 --> 04:45.815
you'd save me from the Bortex
or detail my bike

04:45.816 --> 04:47.984
or... or... or... or <i>this,</i>

04:47.985 --> 04:50.787
and then suddenly we have babies
and a chocolate lab? I mean...

04:50.788 --> 04:52.789
No, I always pictured
a labradoodle.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.709
Come on.
It's not gonna happen.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.210
Listen up, people.

04:57.211 --> 05:00.714
Goody mctwoshoes has sprung
some new protocols on us.

05:00.715 --> 05:03.833
Yes, from now on, there'll be
no more solo ops at night.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.835
2-person deployment
at minimum.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.512
Safety and liability reasons.

05:07.513 --> 05:10.307
And since cam is gonna have
his face planted in a laptop

05:10.308 --> 05:12.726
all weekend,
he's gonna need a wingman.

05:12.727 --> 05:17.021
That's gonna be Eenie, Meenie,
Miney... Melanie! You are it!

05:17.022 --> 05:18.940
Oh, God.

05:18.941 --> 05:20.358
Is that a problem?

05:20.359 --> 05:21.868
No, no. It's great.
No, we're good.

05:21.869 --> 05:25.188
Good! Well, then go out there
and catch me a hacker.

05:25.189 --> 05:30.126
Holy Moly! I should get one
made of me for my deck! Heh.

05:37.366 --> 05:39.703
You know, Ariel was 11 pounds
when she was born.

05:39.704 --> 05:40.844
Wow.

05:40.845 --> 05:42.512
Yeah, my vagina
just snapped right back.

05:42.513 --> 05:43.814
Good for you.

05:43.815 --> 05:45.875
Uh-oh. Here she is,
in the goth phase.

05:45.876 --> 05:48.184
- Ooh.
- Look at that. She's 12 years old.

05:48.185 --> 05:49.369
Don't you just want to kiss

05:49.370 --> 05:51.715
that deathly pale,
little, pierced face?

05:51.716 --> 05:53.675
- Ooh.
- Yeah. You want to see the love of my life?

05:53.676 --> 05:54.926
Yes, I do.

05:54.927 --> 05:57.377
My dog Sammy.
People even say we look alike.

05:57.378 --> 05:59.629
Oh, my God.
Yeah. He's a stray.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.215
I found him in the woods
one night, drinking.

06:02.216 --> 06:05.001
So adorable. Look at that.
Mm-hmm.

06:05.002 --> 06:07.921
You know your dog
is a possum, right? Yeah.

06:07.922 --> 06:09.723
I can tell because
this is a possum.

06:09.724 --> 06:11.174
Ladies.

06:11.175 --> 06:13.945
As much as I love hearing
about her freaky pet rodent,

06:13.946 --> 06:15.739
I've got operatives
in the field.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.074
Here we go.
This is it. 

06:18.075 --> 06:20.100
<i>Dude, cash's antenna
actually worked.</i>

06:20.101 --> 06:22.120
<i>We just pulled up
in front of Rembrandt's house.</i>

06:22.121 --> 06:23.621
Cut my legs off
and call me "shorty."

06:23.622 --> 06:25.707
<i>Now stake out the house
until we get r. On the hacker.</i>

06:25.708 --> 06:27.374
<i>Then I want you
to come back here,</i>

06:27.375 --> 06:29.159
<i>i'm gonna put my head
under the tire of the car,</i>

06:29.160 --> 06:31.296
<i>and I want you
to back it up. Okay?</i>

06:31.297 --> 06:33.497
Okay, we're...
We're gonna go now.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.402
So... just you and me...

06:39.403 --> 06:42.015
But not in that way.

06:42.016 --> 06:43.892
Didn't mean it like that.

06:45.144 --> 06:47.562
Oh, my God. Wow, wow.

06:47.563 --> 06:48.929
How do you... where is...
Where's the button?

06:48.930 --> 06:49.939
Where's the button?
How do you change that?

06:49.940 --> 06:51.882
You don't.
The knob's missing, and...

06:51.883 --> 06:53.466
I can't find a new one.

06:53.467 --> 06:54.718
For the last year,
it's been stuck on...

06:54.719 --> 06:57.521
"La movidita 101.3!"

06:58.606 --> 07:00.140
Here.

07:00.141 --> 07:03.620
Oh, no. See?
Right there. This.

07:03.621 --> 07:05.812
It's like you're living
in a Katherine Heigl movie,

07:05.813 --> 07:07.197
and she sucks.

07:07.198 --> 07:08.782
I was... I was just being nice.

07:08.783 --> 07:11.618
No, you were being chivalrous,
going all heigl...

07:11.619 --> 07:15.155
Jackets over puddles,
making out in the rain... puke.

07:15.156 --> 07:17.624
I would never
put a jacket on a puddle,

07:17.625 --> 07:19.302
especially if it's suede.

07:19.303 --> 07:22.979
Cam, I'm sorry.
You're a great guy...

07:22.980 --> 07:25.642
But you need
a romantic comedy girl,

07:25.643 --> 07:27.801
and that's just not me.
Dude...

07:27.802 --> 07:31.940
I don't even like to cuddle.
How many chicks can say that?

07:31.941 --> 07:34.359
Yeah, I... I get it.
We're just friends.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.844
Damn right.
We're just friends.

07:40.314 --> 07:43.316
Oh. Oh, what are you doing?

07:43.317 --> 07:44.351
Wha...

07:44.352 --> 07:46.353
What are you... ohh, no, no.

07:46.354 --> 07:47.470
Nothing. What?
Ohh.

07:47.471 --> 07:48.540
Uhh!

07:50.741 --> 07:52.993
Hey. How you doing?

07:52.994 --> 07:54.327
Y'all staking out
my house, right?

07:54.328 --> 07:55.862
What? No, we're just friends.

07:55.863 --> 07:57.297
What?
What?

07:57.298 --> 07:58.331
Made you pop-tarts.

07:58.332 --> 08:00.468
Huh? And you are who?

08:00.469 --> 08:03.703
You slow? I'm Rembrandt, fool.
The hacker?

08:03.704 --> 08:05.088
Y'all been sitting
out here all night.

08:05.089 --> 08:07.156
I mean, any more obvious,

08:07.157 --> 08:09.018
you'd be in a damn van
marked "surveillance."

08:09.019 --> 08:10.520
How old <i>are</i> you?

08:10.521 --> 08:13.773
I'm 14, your fineness, if you
ever want to trade up from that.

08:13.774 --> 08:17.777
Inappropriate. This is not
a game. You are in deep trouble.

08:17.778 --> 08:19.502
Look, man, I'm late
for skipping school, but, um,

08:19.503 --> 08:21.054
catch me if you can, chumps.
All right?

08:21.055 --> 08:22.672
All right. Looking good.

08:27.119 --> 08:29.622
All right.
Here's what we got so far.

08:29.623 --> 08:32.583
This is Rembrandt,
a.K.A. Jamal Jenkins.

08:32.585 --> 08:34.451
Not since Cameron price
have we seen a hacker

08:34.452 --> 08:37.255
with this kind of skill.
This kid's only 14.

08:37.256 --> 08:40.188
<i>14.</i> Whatever happened
to kids just being kids?

08:40.190 --> 08:42.525
Playing hide-and-go-seek,

08:42.525 --> 08:45.597
reverse cowgirl,
tramp stamps... I mean,

08:45.598 --> 08:47.807
kids deserve a childhood.
It's sad.

08:47.808 --> 08:49.633
I guess the only thing
we can do is call the po-po.

08:49.634 --> 08:52.645
They'll have lil' bow wow
in jail before study hall.

08:52.646 --> 08:55.481
Oh. I'm getting call waiting.
Sorry. It's my conscience.

08:55.482 --> 08:57.817
Hi, Renee. Yeah.
Oh, sorry.

08:57.818 --> 09:01.678
Can you hear me now? Yes.
Yes, I will. Thank you.

09:01.679 --> 09:03.730
Renee thinks you're a douche.

09:03.731 --> 09:04.881
I'm not paid
to have a conscience.

09:04.882 --> 09:07.243
That's why we gotta
Shawshank this kid.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.019
Well, I'm sorry, Oswald,
but as a mother,

09:09.020 --> 09:11.164
I simply cannot
allow this to happen.

09:11.165 --> 09:13.490
As a guy who's been
in the security business

09:13.491 --> 09:18.504
for the last 20 years,
I'm telling you, <i>stay out of it.</i>

09:19.965 --> 09:22.634
Do not lie to me, Jamal.

09:22.635 --> 09:24.167
Now if what she's saying
is true,

09:24.168 --> 09:25.418
you won't be
going to m.I.T.

09:25.419 --> 09:26.836
You're gonna go straight
to the penitentiary,

09:26.837 --> 09:28.389
just like
your Uncle Floyd.

09:28.390 --> 09:31.458
Uncle Floyd was making up-skirt
videos. I didn't do nothin'.

09:31.459 --> 09:34.229
You never "do nothin',"
do you, Jamal?

09:34.230 --> 09:35.929
Know what? I've had enough.

09:35.930 --> 09:38.081
Three women ganging up on me...
I'm not with this.

09:38.082 --> 09:39.734
I don't like it at all.
I'm outta here.

09:39.735 --> 09:43.655
Hey, girl.
I'd drink your bathwater.

09:43.656 --> 09:46.890
Honestly, I don't know what's happened
to him...

09:46.891 --> 09:49.359
But he used to be
such a great kid.

09:49.360 --> 09:53.164
He was an honor student,
did school plays, but now...

09:53.165 --> 09:55.291
I just don't know
what else to do.

09:55.292 --> 09:59.295
J'ney, may I ask you a question,
just mother to mother?

09:59.296 --> 10:00.870
Actually, it's Janet.

10:00.871 --> 10:02.271
Oh, "Janet." Yes, of course.

10:02.272 --> 10:04.324
Janet, uh,
it might have been obvious,

10:04.325 --> 10:06.511
but I feel like
I really get Jamal...

10:06.512 --> 10:07.512
Excuse me?

10:07.513 --> 10:09.879
Um, I don't think
we should be here.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.083
And I was wondering if you would
let me take him under my wing,

10:13.084 --> 10:14.584
just for a little while,

10:14.585 --> 10:16.753
to see if I could
help him get back on track.

10:19.565 --> 10:23.111
Okay. Okay.

10:23.112 --> 10:26.012
I really appreciate the interest
that you're taking in Jamal.

10:26.013 --> 10:29.242
Oh, come on, girlfriend.
It ain't no <i>thang.</i>

10:29.243 --> 10:31.518
Okay. Now you have
reached your limit.

10:31.519 --> 10:33.162
Thank you for coming by.

10:33.163 --> 10:36.249
- Well, thank <i>you,</i> j'ney.
- It's "Janet."

10:36.250 --> 10:37.741
Sorry.

10:39.026 --> 10:41.045
You want tickets
to the gun show?

10:41.046 --> 10:42.645
I'm not a...
I'm not a fan of guns.

10:42.646 --> 10:44.382
What about
these guns, baby?

10:44.383 --> 10:45.865
Are you crazy?

10:45.866 --> 10:47.510
I tell you to stay out of it,
and this is what you do?

10:47.511 --> 10:49.536
I'm sorry, Oswald, but that boy
out there is in trouble,

10:49.537 --> 10:53.489
and I'm going to save him.
This is my "the blind side."

10:53.490 --> 10:54.874
Oh, dear God, no.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.562
Oh, yes. Oh, that's
a darling little movie.

10:57.563 --> 10:59.095
The girl from "speed,"

10:59.096 --> 11:02.849
- and she takes in a gentle giant of a boy.
- I've seen it.

11:02.850 --> 11:06.988
You can be the husband,
and Jamal is our big Mike.

11:06.989 --> 11:11.357
Listen, oz, everyone else has
given up on that kid out there,

11:11.358 --> 11:15.228
but not me, and that is why
I have made him...

11:15.229 --> 11:18.698
Our new office intern.

11:18.699 --> 11:20.543
No, no. Veronica,
you've got it backwards.

11:20.544 --> 11:22.735
This is not a boy
that you make an intern.

11:22.736 --> 11:25.173
This is a boy
that you <i>turn in.</i>

11:25.174 --> 11:26.489
Mark my words...

11:26.490 --> 11:29.826
Jamal Alphonso Jenkins
will surprise us all.

11:29.827 --> 11:33.681
Well, he's certainly
off to a wonderful start.

11:33.682 --> 11:35.465
Go ahead. Touch it.
I-I don't think I should...

11:35.466 --> 11:37.383
Go ahead. Touch it.
Right now. Go ahead.

11:37.384 --> 11:39.302
Nice and hard, right?
Uh-huh. That's right.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.501
I knew it.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.853
From fist bump to cuddle,

11:43.854 --> 11:46.188
that's the power
of the epic gesture, baby.

11:46.189 --> 11:48.474
Next stop...
The bone zone.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.110
Okay, just
keep it down. She's right there.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.145
Uh, hey, Mel?
You have a quick second?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.814
Time's up.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.067
You're like
the beeper kiosk at the mall...

11:58.068 --> 11:59.526
Shut down.

11:59.527 --> 12:00.944
Oh, dude, shut up.
Seriously?

12:00.945 --> 12:02.655
That was both a burn
<i>and</i> a social commentary.

12:02.656 --> 12:03.697
Respect.

12:03.698 --> 12:06.659
Hey. What's the deal
with you and Melanie?

12:06.660 --> 12:08.210
Why is she giving you
the cold shoulder?

12:08.211 --> 12:10.162
Something might
have happened last night

12:10.163 --> 12:11.697
at the stakeout.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.833
Really? You two? Car Booty?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.292
They cuddled.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.136
Cuddles?!

12:17.137 --> 12:18.629
Bat cave now.

12:20.214 --> 12:21.673
Okay. Now who cuddled who?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.842
Did you cuddle her,
or did she cuddle you?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.219
Uh, I think she cuddled me.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.429
No!

12:27.430 --> 12:29.848
<i>You</i> cuddled <i>her.</i>
You understand?

12:29.849 --> 12:32.934
<i>You</i> cuddled <i>her.</i> Say it!

12:32.935 --> 12:35.312
I... cuddled her?

12:35.313 --> 12:37.773
The thing you gotta
understand about Melanie

12:37.774 --> 12:39.858
is that feelings are
like kryptonite to her.

12:39.859 --> 12:43.570
The only way she can handle 'em
is to fly away from 'em.

12:43.571 --> 12:47.583
Um, Melanie?
Will you be my Valentine?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.570
Class? We have
a new transfer student today.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.831
Say "hello" to Melanie.

12:54.832 --> 12:56.291
So you better undo
that cuddle with Melanie

12:56.292 --> 12:59.002
before she transfers
to another school.

12:59.003 --> 13:01.088
Okay? <i>Boop.</i>

13:01.089 --> 13:05.250
So, Jamal, as our beloved
and respected intern,

13:05.251 --> 13:08.971
your job will be filing,
faxing, color-coding...

13:08.972 --> 13:11.515
All the things that
teenage boys love the most.

13:11.516 --> 13:14.193
Oh.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.112
But most importantly, Jamal,

13:16.113 --> 13:18.021
I would like you
to make yourself at home.

13:18.022 --> 13:20.098
Oh, miss Mann,

13:20.099 --> 13:22.901
you do not know how much
I appreciate this opportunity.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.737
Oh, come on. Call me "moms."

13:25.738 --> 13:27.197
"Moms."

13:27.198 --> 13:28.740
Oh!

13:28.741 --> 13:30.826
Yeah, I'm-a get to know
you people real quick.

13:33.964 --> 13:35.748
Jamal. Come to moms.

13:44.130 --> 13:46.383
Mel, wait. We need to talk.

13:46.384 --> 13:48.677
I've got nothing to say.

13:48.678 --> 13:50.262
Just...

13:50.263 --> 13:53.131
I'm sorry about this morning.
I shoplifted the cuddle.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.726
It was my fault.
It'll never happen again.

13:55.727 --> 13:56.977
Okay. Are you done now?

13:56.978 --> 13:58.737
You know what? No, no.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.731
Look, I didn't shoplift
the cuddle! All right?

14:00.732 --> 14:03.442
I woke up, and we were spooning.
And guess what?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.478
<i>You</i> were the <i>big</i> spoon. Yeah.

14:06.479 --> 14:10.949
A big soup ladle, and I was
just a little baby food spoon.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.242
What are you talking about?

14:12.243 --> 14:14.954
Dude, <i>you</i> cuddled <i>me,</i>

14:14.955 --> 14:18.573
and I don't care anymore. I get it.
You're not into me, and frankly,

14:18.574 --> 14:20.009
- seeing this side of you...
- I am.

14:20.010 --> 14:22.043
I'm not into you, either,
so you can just go...

14:22.044 --> 14:25.347
â™ª

14:27.667 --> 14:30.594
you think that weak excuse
for a kiss makes up for...

14:30.595 --> 14:33.505
â™ª

14:41.281 --> 14:42.865
I can't believe
this finally happened.

14:42.866 --> 14:45.358
I know. Me, too.

14:45.359 --> 14:47.703
Because right now...

14:49.072 --> 14:51.373
Kind of
in the perfect moment.

14:51.374 --> 14:54.243
Oh. So you're
a heigl after all.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.366
Right now I am.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.919
Ready for round three?

15:03.920 --> 15:05.203
Absolutely.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.705
Just give me 20 minutes
and some coconut water,

15:06.706 --> 15:08.373
I'll be good to go.
Oh, God. Shut up.

15:11.302 --> 15:13.846
Veronica. Got ourselves a little
bit of a situation here.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.814
Oh, yeah?
Well, make it snappy.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.266
I'm taking Jamal out
for ice cream and a new laptop.

15:18.267 --> 15:20.218
The situation
is <i>about</i> Jamal.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.649
- Yeah, he's, like, you know, a dick.
- Total dick.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.357
Yeah, you should change
his name to "Richard."

15:25.358 --> 15:28.652
All he ever does is come on
to us foxy babes in the office.

15:28.653 --> 15:32.155
Ooh, hey, little miss Muffet,
let me <i>slap</i> that tuffet.

15:32.156 --> 15:35.158
Ooh. I'll get you
<i>double</i> pregnant. Yeah.

15:35.159 --> 15:37.419
Oh, no.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.171
What's happened there?

15:43.416 --> 15:46.095
He's also stolen some laptops,
all of our files,

15:46.096 --> 15:47.429
everybody's
social security number...

15:47.430 --> 15:49.673
The kid's a klepto.
He's gotta go.

15:49.674 --> 15:54.053
Oh, okay. The name on the card
is "buddy r..." I-is it "revell"?

15:54.054 --> 15:57.472
Yeah, "b-buddy revell."
Uh-huh. I'll take 20 of 'em.

15:57.473 --> 15:58.974
That's right.

15:58.975 --> 16:01.760
Would you callous people
be interested to know

16:01.761 --> 16:04.437
<i>why</i> Jamal might be
acting out like this?

16:04.438 --> 16:06.273
Mnh-mnh.
Negative.

16:06.274 --> 16:10.369
 Jamal's father
pushed a broom for initech for 30 years,

16:10.370 --> 16:14.156
and one day before he was
supposed to receive his pension,

16:14.157 --> 16:17.701
they fired him.
How do you feel about it now?

16:17.702 --> 16:19.369
I don't care at all.

16:19.370 --> 16:23.332
Veronica, Jamal's father is a very successful
chiropractor. 

16:23.333 --> 16:25.667
You've been played
by a child, my dear.

16:25.668 --> 16:27.219
Veronica.
What?

16:27.220 --> 16:30.122
Jamal has just hacked
into o.C.P.'S bank accounts.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.123
Oh.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.558
And he pinched my bottom.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.592
Mm.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.469
Um, oz, could I
have a moment, please?

16:39.555 --> 16:41.009
It's... it's rather urgent.

16:41.096 --> 16:43.064
Really not in the mood
to hear about your protocol.

16:43.065 --> 16:45.399
Well, actually,
I'm about to break protocol

16:45.400 --> 16:48.102
- and share some rather sensitive
information with you. - Mm.

16:48.103 --> 16:50.104
I think Veronica's
"blind side" thing is

16:50.105 --> 16:52.703
really about her relationship
with her daughter.

16:52.704 --> 16:54.325
Yeah, I've seen the photos...
Picnics, puzzles...

16:54.326 --> 16:55.559
They're besties.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.079
Yes, when she was 10,
but since then,

16:58.080 --> 17:00.086
she's become
a bit of a... monster.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.116
- Huh.
- That's why Veronica was in Boston.

17:02.117 --> 17:04.734
She was taking Ariel
to a school for troubled teens.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.760
You see Ariel had her...
Everything pierced,

17:06.842 --> 17:09.178
and she started smoking 
"Hip-Hop" cigarettes

17:09.179 --> 17:12.576
Ohh. Now you got me
feeling feelings...

17:12.577 --> 17:14.411
For <i>her!</i> Ohh.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.478
S-sorry.

17:17.479 --> 17:19.267
So you just skip school
when your parents are at work?

17:19.268 --> 17:22.086
I mean, what are you doing here,
huh? I mean...

17:22.087 --> 17:24.188
You could be the next
jobs or zuckerberg.

17:24.189 --> 17:25.856
You're throwing
your life away. Why?

17:25.857 --> 17:28.864
<i>What?</i> You think social network
can bring people together?

17:28.865 --> 17:31.946
What I got
is a real people-pleaser...

17:31.947 --> 17:34.203
X-rated holograms.

17:34.204 --> 17:36.747
Ooh.
Top secret.

17:36.748 --> 17:38.152
All right, look, look,
you're still...

17:38.153 --> 17:40.321
You're gonna return
all the stolen merchandise,

17:40.322 --> 17:43.879
and you are gonna give Veronica
her "blind side" moment.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.882
"Blind side"?
Hey! That's racist.

17:46.883 --> 17:51.345
Yes. Yes, it is, but you're
gonna do it anyway, or else.

17:51.346 --> 17:54.140
"Or else" what?
I'm Rembrandt, fool.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.685
I'm gonna
hard-knock your life.

17:57.686 --> 17:59.590
<i>Gee whiskers
and leaping lizards!</i>

17:59.591 --> 18:00.958
<i>I love you, too,
daddy warbucks!</i>

18:00.959 --> 18:03.460
Okay, look, I was 12.
I was just a little kid.

18:03.461 --> 18:05.484
<i>Thank you...</i>
That was an all-boys school.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.181
What kind of sick,
twisted drama teacher

18:07.182 --> 18:09.613
thinks "Annie" is a good idea
at an all-boys school?

18:09.614 --> 18:11.449
I said the same thing.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.637
Well, regardless, if this were
to leak out on the Internet,

18:13.638 --> 18:15.703
it would pretty much destroy
your street cred, wouldn't it?

18:15.704 --> 18:18.998
It would.
Only one problem there.

18:18.999 --> 18:22.163
No one knows what Rembrandt
looks like. Ha ha!

18:24.211 --> 18:25.649
<i>I'm Rembrandt, fool.</i>

18:28.840 --> 18:31.052
So... so you said, "blind side"?
That's... that's...

18:31.053 --> 18:32.553
That's the one with
the chick from "speed," right?

18:32.554 --> 18:33.804
Bingo.

18:33.805 --> 18:36.015
Okay. (Laughs) All right.

18:36.016 --> 18:38.392
All right. Now I got
one other kid to help out.

18:38.393 --> 18:40.686
Where were <i>you</i> last night?

18:40.687 --> 18:43.851
"Love and other drugs" came on.
Anne hathaway gets topless.

18:43.852 --> 18:45.316
I wanted to watch it
on the phone with you.

18:45.317 --> 18:47.938
Ooh, bummer to miss that, but I
was kind of with Mel all night.

18:47.939 --> 18:50.029
No! We did it?

18:50.030 --> 18:54.075
Like, we did <i>it?</i>
Did we like it? Were we good?

18:54.076 --> 18:56.160
Dude, there is no "we."

18:56.161 --> 18:58.149
Yes, there is.
I need to feel what you felt,

18:58.150 --> 18:59.533
experience
what you've experienced.

18:59.534 --> 19:01.290
We need to mind meld.

19:01.291 --> 19:04.585
All right, cash? Chill.
Virginity's making you crazy.

19:04.586 --> 19:07.324
Falsehood.
I had sex with a lady twice.

19:07.325 --> 19:12.213
Comic-con '08 and '09.
It was she-hulk and lady Yoda.

19:14.416 --> 19:16.200
Hey, have you seen Mel?

19:16.201 --> 19:17.868
Ain't seen her.

19:20.088 --> 19:21.722
<i>The thing you gotta understand</i>

19:21.723 --> 19:24.708
<i>about Melanie is that feelings
are like kryptonite to her.</i>

19:24.709 --> 19:27.645
<i>The only way she can handle 'em
is to fly away from 'em.</i>

19:30.816 --> 19:33.280
I'm sorry, kid. She's gone.

19:33.281 --> 19:35.574
Just tell Cameron I...

19:35.575 --> 19:38.035
Just explain it to him.

19:38.036 --> 19:39.857
I will.

19:39.858 --> 19:42.832
You'll... you'll always have
a place here. Never forget that.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.862
I never will.

19:51.203 --> 19:53.551
Bye, oz.

19:53.552 --> 19:54.839
Be safe.

20:04.519 --> 20:06.851
She wanted me
to give this to you.

20:32.922 --> 20:35.746
If it makes you feel any better,
she does love you.

20:37.385 --> 20:39.138
Just hates love.

20:39.139 --> 20:41.085
Let's do this.

20:43.266 --> 20:44.810
Hasta la vista, baby.

20:44.811 --> 20:48.008
â™ª Even if the flowers are gone â™ª

20:48.009 --> 20:52.012
â™ª even when the sun is down
and things are undone â™ª

20:52.013 --> 20:54.899
â™ª even when the lakes are dry â™ª

20:54.900 --> 20:58.969
â™ª even when the last leaves
are falling down â™ª

20:58.970 --> 21:02.523
â™ª love will be around â™ª

21:02.524 --> 21:06.123
â™ª love will be around â™ª

21:06.124 --> 21:08.579
â™ª even if the flowers are gone â™ª

21:08.580 --> 21:12.950
â™ª even when the sun is down
and things are undone â™ª

21:12.951 --> 21:15.652
â™ª even when the lakes are dry â™ª

21:15.653 --> 21:19.803
â™ª even when the last leaves
are falling down â™ª

21:19.804 --> 21:22.343
â™ª love will be around â™ª

21:22.344 --> 21:24.308
â™ª love will be around â™ª

21:24.309 --> 21:26.430
Ah...

21:26.431 --> 21:28.299
We finished.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.100
Whoo!

21:30.101 --> 21:31.635
â™ª
