Daly: Tonight, the final week
of blind auditions begins.

00:07.191 --> 00:09.917
Adam starts the night
with nine artists.

00:09.919 --> 00:12.191
Alicia and Gwen
each have eight,

00:12.192 --> 00:14.124
while Blake has seven.

00:14.125 --> 00:15.957
Our coaches will fight
to the finish

00:15.958 --> 00:19.491
to fill their teams with some
of the best voices in America.

00:26.658 --> 00:27.857
I got you.
I'll take it.

00:27.858 --> 00:29.491
Daly:
There will be no rules...

00:29.492 --> 00:31.024
Is that cheating,
what you did?

00:31.025 --> 00:32.024
Yep.

00:32.025 --> 00:33.357
[Laughter]

00:33.358 --> 00:34.391
...no mercy...

00:34.392 --> 00:35.357
Oh, you like that?

00:35.358 --> 00:36.657
You like that?
Get out of my sight.

00:36.658 --> 00:38.791
I'm gonna claw,
and I'm gonna fight.

00:38.792 --> 00:40.757
He is manipulating you.

00:40.758 --> 00:42.924
Alicia: When Gwen's ready to go
in, she goes...

00:42.925 --> 00:45.024
Were you not singing
right to me, though?

00:45.025 --> 00:46.691
[Laughter]
A little bit?

00:46.692 --> 00:48.291
We can have
so much fun together.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.491

just want a friend.

Alicia: It's getting
kind of serious now.

01:00.858 --> 01:02.891
Wait till you see
what I do around here.

01:02.892 --> 01:05.557
RJ, we need beautiful
black men like you.

01:05.558 --> 01:06.691
You just said my name.

01:06.692 --> 01:07.591
I did.

01:07.592 --> 01:09.424
Oh, now she's
just flirting.

01:09.425 --> 01:11.057
Here comes
the, uh, Hamburglar down here.

01:11.058 --> 01:12.091
Okay, time out.

01:12.092 --> 01:14.157
Hamburglar
didn't wear this.

Daly: The final week
of blind auditions...

01:19.425 --> 01:20.957
Yee-haw!

01:20.958 --> 01:23.757
...kicks off right now.

01:23.758 --> 01:25.991
All right, teams are filling up.
It's getting real.

01:25.992 --> 01:28.057
Well, I know
that it's somewhere

01:28.058 --> 01:30.291
between me and Gwen...
the strongest team.

01:30.292 --> 01:31.424
Oh, is that
what you think, huh?
I don't know about that.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.957
But I do feel like
every single one of us

01:32.958 --> 01:34.757
has at least one person
that can... that can win.

01:34.758 --> 01:36.491
Clearly, I have
the worst team,

01:36.492 --> 01:38.057
as I always do
every season.

01:38.058 --> 01:39.457
That's why I win most.

01:39.458 --> 01:40.724
Define "most."

01:40.725 --> 01:43.757
I'm staying right here.

01:43.758 --> 01:44.891
I'm not going anywhere.

01:44.892 --> 01:46.657
Daly: As our coaches head
to their chairs,

01:46.658 --> 01:48.824
let's meet
the night's first artist,

01:48.825 --> 01:51.391
who knows how to make the most
out of a tight situation.

01:51.392 --> 01:52.591
Oh, hey, welcome.

01:52.592 --> 01:54.891
Come on in. I'll show you
around my tiny house.

01:54.892 --> 01:56.491
♪♪♪

01:56.492 --> 01:59.291
My name is Kenny P.
I'm 30 years old.

01:59.292 --> 02:00.324
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio,

02:00.325 --> 02:02.091
and now I live
in Nashville, Tennessee.

02:02.092 --> 02:03.691
My wife and I came down
to Nashville

02:03.692 --> 02:06.157
for me being
a full-time musician.

02:06.158 --> 02:08.291
We knew that we would be making
some sacrifices,

02:08.292 --> 02:11.424
and we would need to financially
make it work for us.

02:11.425 --> 02:13.824
And we decided
to build a tiny house.

02:13.825 --> 02:15.857
So over here,
we've got our kitchen.

02:15.858 --> 02:18.391
Up above that,
we've got the bedroom.

02:18.392 --> 02:20.857
Down over here,
we've got the bathroom.

02:20.858 --> 02:24.491
And up above that,
we've got our living room.

02:24.492 --> 02:25.957
That's the tiny house tour.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.957
It took us about eight months
to build it,

02:28.958 --> 02:33.791
and it's about 294 square feet
if you include the 2 lofts.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.524
We've also got two dogs...

02:35.525 --> 02:36.591
Excuse me.

02:36.592 --> 02:38.824
...and it can get
a little tight sometimes,

02:38.825 --> 02:39.924
but we love it.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.557
Bye, dogs.
Bye, dogs.

02:41.558 --> 02:43.757
I come from
a very musical family.

02:43.758 --> 02:46.191
My dad plays the banjo
and sings.

02:46.192 --> 02:48.024
My grandpa plays the button box.

02:48.025 --> 02:50.824
Uh, my grandpa tried to teach me
the accordion when I was a kid.

02:50.825 --> 02:52.857
I didn't practice much, but...

02:52.858 --> 02:56.424
As I got older,
I was in bands... rock bands.

02:56.425 --> 02:58.724
I was in a punk band
for a little while.

02:58.725 --> 03:00.991
I was even in a screamo band.

03:00.992 --> 03:02.757
We were not that good,

03:02.758 --> 03:04.357
but we had a lot of fun
doing it.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.591
♪ Mama told me ♪

03:06.592 --> 03:08.491
Now I'm playing
a lot of country music

03:08.492 --> 03:12.257
six days a week at Tootsies
in Honky Tonk Central.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.292
It's been
an awesome experience,

03:14.725 --> 03:17.291
but I don't think I
could play for tips for
the rest of my life.

03:17.292 --> 03:18.557
I'm ready to take it
to the next level...
Whoo!

03:18.558 --> 03:20.391
Why, thank you so much.

03:20.392 --> 03:23.324
...and "The Voice" is the
perfect opportunity to do so.

03:23.325 --> 03:26.524
I feel a whirlwind of emotions,
but mostly excitement.

03:26.525 --> 03:28.191
When we both moved
to Nashville,

03:28.192 --> 03:30.624
I left a great job in Cleveland
that I loved very much,

03:30.625 --> 03:32.457
as a speech therapist.

03:32.458 --> 03:33.991
But I'm so proud of him,
that he's here.

03:33.992 --> 03:36.257
I think that he deserves it
so much.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.424
He's got
such a great voice.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.857
I want other people
to hear that.

03:38.858 --> 03:41.424
So excited for him.

03:41.425 --> 03:43.257
Kenny P.:
I do love country music,

03:43.258 --> 03:46.191
But I like a lot of blues
and funk and soul music.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.591
For the blind audition,

03:47.592 --> 03:50.491
I'll be singing "Hello It's Me"
by Todd Rundgren.

03:50.492 --> 03:52.024
I'm trying to put
my own little spin

03:52.025 --> 03:54.391
on the dynamics
in the vocals.

03:54.392 --> 03:57.224
I need this to show everybody
what we've been working for.

03:57.225 --> 03:58.658
Oh, boy.
Ah!

My name's Kenny P.

I'm from Cleveland, Ohio,

06:02.558 --> 06:04.624

in Nashville, Tennessee.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.791
Oh! When Gwen's ready to go in,
she goes...

06:09.792 --> 06:12.057
I got to swipe
the pony back and forth.

06:12.058 --> 06:13.191
I got to swipe it out...
Kenny P.: I love it.

06:13.192 --> 06:16.891
...get all the bad vibes
swung away, ready to go.

06:16.892 --> 06:18.624
Yes.
I want to hear what Blake
has to say about this.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.557
Oh, you do? Oh, you...
Yeah, because
I'm interested.

06:20.558 --> 06:22.957
The way you're able
to attack those notes

06:22.958 --> 06:24.524
with so much power,

06:24.525 --> 06:26.657
like you didn't even need
the microphone.

06:26.658 --> 06:27.891
And then I turn around,

06:27.892 --> 06:30.091
and I see you have
this cool mustache...

06:30.092 --> 06:32.357
[Laughter]
...and that hat.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.324
You could be... You know
those guys that push the
boats in... in Italy,

06:35.325 --> 06:36.924
that they're pushing them
down it.

06:36.925 --> 06:38.824
And all I could think of
with that mustache

06:38.825 --> 06:40.857
and with your voice, man, you
could make a fortune down there.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.391
And my sweater.
Oh, my God.

06:42.392 --> 06:44.357
Thank you.

06:44.358 --> 06:45.424
Hey Blake, Blake.
Here com...

06:45.425 --> 06:46.557
Those are called gondoliers.

06:46.558 --> 06:48.524
Here comes
the, uh, Hamburglar down here.

06:48.525 --> 06:49.757
Let's hear what
he's got to say.

06:49.758 --> 06:51.491
Yeah.
Okay, time out.

06:51.492 --> 06:54.257
Hamburglar didn't wear this
at all.

06:54.258 --> 06:56.891
Like, his outfit and vibe
was so different.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.724
Can I talk to Kenny
for a minute?

06:58.725 --> 07:00.757
Give it up, bro.
You fighting against a girl.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.257
Just let it go.

07:02.258 --> 07:03.991
She will be
mad at you.

07:03.992 --> 07:05.457
See what... You see
what's happening here, Kenny?

07:05.458 --> 07:06.591
I do.
I see what's going on.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.424
It is literally
three against one here.

07:08.425 --> 07:09.491
Nuh-unh.
It is.

07:09.492 --> 07:10.791
I think
you can do it, Blake.

07:10.792 --> 07:11.924
You do?

07:11.925 --> 07:13.891
I think
you can do it.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.824
Take that,
California people.

07:15.825 --> 07:18.225
[Laughter]

07:19.125 --> 07:21.191
I'm curious...
why Nashville?

07:21.192 --> 07:23.224
I was doing pretty good
in Cleveland,

07:23.225 --> 07:25.191
and then felt like
I was peaking.

07:25.192 --> 07:26.391
And I just wanted to try

07:26.392 --> 07:28.191
and, you know, get in
where everybody's at.

07:28.192 --> 07:31.024
So I play a lot more country
than I used to.

07:31.025 --> 07:32.057
Yee-haw!

07:32.058 --> 07:33.191
[Laughter]

07:33.192 --> 07:34.491
So do I.

07:34.492 --> 07:36.924
[Laughter]

07:36.925 --> 07:39.891
[Cheers and applause]

07:39.892 --> 07:41.724
It's just so great.

07:41.725 --> 07:43.724
Neither one of you really
has taken the claws out at all.

07:43.725 --> 07:45.691
It's true.
They're very tenderly...

07:45.692 --> 07:47.024
I know.
You're so sweet, aww.

07:47.025 --> 07:49.091
I know.
They love each other.

07:49.092 --> 07:50.524
Come on!

07:50.525 --> 07:52.491
All right.

07:52.492 --> 07:53.991
[Laughter]

07:53.992 --> 07:57.791
Do you know how important
Nashville is to me?

07:57.792 --> 08:00.457
And, of course,
I want to see the best things

08:00.458 --> 08:02.624
that can happen for you
happen in... in real life,

08:02.625 --> 08:04.357
not just on this show.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.924
Gwen doesn't care
about you.

08:05.925 --> 08:07.757
[Laughter]

08:07.758 --> 08:09.124
All right,
that was one claw.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.291
That was...
I liked it.
I stuck a claw in you.

08:10.292 --> 08:11.457
That was good.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.157
I don't really know
the Nashville scene,

08:13.158 --> 08:15.991
although I have been to about
2 billion Blake Shelton concerts

08:15.992 --> 08:17.057
in the last year,

08:17.058 --> 08:19.091
which I enjoyed
very, very much.

08:19.092 --> 08:21.491
But there's something theatrical
about you.

08:21.492 --> 08:23.124
You have something to say
with what you're doing

08:23.125 --> 08:24.791
with your facial hair,
with...

08:24.792 --> 08:26.091
with j-just
your whole look.

08:26.092 --> 08:27.891
You know what I mean?
And I understand that.

08:27.892 --> 08:29.891
That's something I've been doing
for a long time,

08:29.892 --> 08:31.324
so I'd love
to work with you.

08:31.325 --> 08:32.390
Thank you.

08:32.392 --> 08:33.724
[Cheers and applause]

08:33.725 --> 08:36.091
Kenny, who do you pick
as your coach?

08:36.092 --> 08:38.124
Yay!

08:38.125 --> 08:39.825
[Cheers and applause]

Daly: Welcome back.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.166
We caught up
with our next artist in Chicago.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.399
My name is RJ Collins.
I'm 18 years old.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.132
After graduating high school,
I got a job at Guitar Center,

18:27.133 --> 18:29.999
and it's been the perfect job
for me because, on my break,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.199
I have the piano room,
I have the drum room.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.399
I get to go around
and try every instrument.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.433
It's an amazing experience,
and I'm grateful for it.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.299
I grew up in a family
of self-taught musicians.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.732
My mother sang.
All her family members sang.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.832
And, um,
it was just in my blood.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.632
As a kid,
I was very nervous, you know?

18:46.633 --> 18:48.632
I didn't really want to sing
around people.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.266
But I had a brother
who was 10 years older than me.

18:51.267 --> 18:52.566
His name was Randy.

18:52.567 --> 18:54.332
He would just say,
"Man, you sing so good.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.832
Just... just sing.
Just do it."

18:55.833 --> 18:58.532
That was his motto...
"You don't know until you try."

18:58.533 --> 19:02.899
My brother was killed by police
in 2009.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.799
We just got a call saying
that my brother was shot.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.932
So that was really tough.

19:06.933 --> 19:09.732
Like, I didn't feel like
I had anyone to turn to.

19:09.733 --> 19:13.032
I've never thought that Randy
would die on me, and...

19:13.033 --> 19:14.399
I thought we would have forever.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.132
After my brother passed away,

19:17.133 --> 19:18.932
that really gave me
the motivation

19:18.933 --> 19:20.699
of, like, getting music started.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.999
You know, he always instilled
in me how to be true to myself.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.232
He always told me, "Be tough,"

19:25.233 --> 19:27.499
and "Don't always give up
so easily."

19:27.500 --> 19:29.132
That's what I took most
from him.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.932
It gave my purpose to pursue
everything that I could

19:31.933 --> 19:33.399
because life is short.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.866
So, about 15 years old,

19:34.867 --> 19:38.232
I performed at a local venue
and the reaction was amazing.

19:38.233 --> 19:39.566
Like, girls were screaming
so loud

19:39.567 --> 19:42.866
I thought the lights would burst
or something.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.766
I've been doing gigs
here and there,

19:44.767 --> 19:45.966
anywhere I could get.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.166
But "The Voice" gives me
the perfect platform

19:48.167 --> 19:50.232
for the world to see
what I have to offer.

19:50.233 --> 19:53.032
I want to enlighten
the entire world with my music.
Yeah.

19:53.033 --> 19:55.299
Especially
being from Chicago.
That's right.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.932
Chicago could use
a little shine right now, too.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.132
Oh, exactly.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.532
You know what I mean?
Son of Chicago come

19:59.533 --> 20:01.132
and doing well
on a show like this.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.832
Exactly.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.199
I believe that
I can be a role model.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.299
If I were to get a chair
to turn today,

20:07.300 --> 20:10.232
it would be a positive light
coming out of my city.

20:10.233 --> 20:14.733
I am so proud of RJ,
just to make it this far.

20:16.533 --> 20:19.566

so emotional because...

20:19.567 --> 20:21.166
I just know
how hard he works,

20:21.167 --> 20:24.732
and I always knew
he was good enough.

20:24.733 --> 20:26.132
RJ: For my blind audition,

20:26.133 --> 20:28.599
I will be singing "Purpose"
by Justin Bieber.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.766
This song means a lot to me.

20:30.767 --> 20:33.032
It's about
when things get tough,

20:33.033 --> 20:34.866
life still goes on, you know?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.766
If I were to get a chair
to turn today,

20:36.767 --> 20:39.132
I think it will be
a sigh of relief for my parents.

20:39.133 --> 20:40.399
It would make them feel
really good,

right in raising me.

in... in your position

24:17.367 --> 24:18.766

how cool it must be

to have Adam
turn around for you.

24:20.667 --> 24:25.032

and a privilege it must be...

turn around for you.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.566

a little glimpse

24:46.567 --> 24:48.032
of what I'm gonna do for you
if I'm your coach.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.066
And you got to
have somebody

24:49.067 --> 24:51.366

completely unwavering.

the things that she tells you.

But I can be the best coach
for you.

I-I... If I didn't feel
that way,

25:18.367 --> 25:20.032
I wouldn't be carrying on
like this.

was super beautiful.

Hey, it's all good.

to compete with Alicia Keys

26:07.967 --> 26:09.566

he's obviously in great hands,

worked well together.

in a million years

and she would be coaching me.

I-I don't!

Daly: Let's see if Adam
can get in the game

27:22.083 --> 27:23.649
with this next singer.

27:23.650 --> 27:25.816
If I look dumb, please be sure
to tell me 'cause, like...

27:25.817 --> 27:26.849
Woman: No, you're fine.

27:26.850 --> 27:27.950
Man: Mark.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.082
I started in music
when I was three.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.482
My mom is actually
a piano teacher,

27:34.483 --> 27:36.582
so I didn't really have
much of a choice.

27:36.583 --> 27:38.782
I hated it,
to be honest with you.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.182
I tried to play football,

27:40.183 --> 27:42.749
realized that I wasn't gonna
get big enough to play football.

27:42.750 --> 27:43.782
So I was like, "Music...

27:43.783 --> 27:45.817
that sounds like
a better approach."

27:47.317 --> 27:49.716
My name is Austin Tyler Jones.
I'm 27.

27:49.717 --> 27:51.149
I'm from Columbia, Tennessee.

27:51.150 --> 27:55.549
My day job... I actually work
managing these two coffee shops.

27:55.550 --> 28:00.249
Normal day for me...
up at 4:30 a.m... boom...

28:00.250 --> 28:04.216
serving the fine people
of Columbia their morning Joe.

28:04.217 --> 28:07.349
And then after work,
doing the family life.

28:07.350 --> 28:09.849
So if you're summing me up,
I would say family man,

28:09.850 --> 28:12.149
coffee drinker, song singer.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.850
That's pretty much
the total package.

28:15.317 --> 28:18.082
My wife and I actually met
when we were in 8th grade.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.049
Did not talk to each other,

28:20.050 --> 28:23.416
and then fast-forward
to high school.

28:23.417 --> 28:26.716
Subtle, shy, flirtatious
advances were made.

28:26.717 --> 28:28.516
Dated my senior year
in high school,

28:28.517 --> 28:32.150
and then locked it down,
you know?

28:34.283 --> 28:37.949
I was playing every week
at church and open-mic nights.

28:40.317 --> 28:43.149

28:43.150 --> 28:46.049
However, with having two
small kids and a wife at home,

28:46.050 --> 28:48.916
there's this kind of
balancing act.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.649
We were told
you were babysitting.

28:50.650 --> 28:52.149
[Laughter]

28:52.150 --> 28:53.916
I'm down.

provides for all of us.

28:55.550 --> 28:58.917
So we're excited to watch him do
this and go after his dream.

29:00.450 --> 29:02.316
Austin:
Dreams are worth pursuing.

31:05.117 --> 31:06.982
How do you know
this stuff?

31:06.983 --> 31:10.182
I do think
you're a-a really great singer.

31:10.183 --> 31:13.116
I feel like that performance
was extra laid-back for me,

31:13.117 --> 31:14.682
and I-I'm looking for people
that come out here

31:14.683 --> 31:16.382
with a sense of urgency

31:16.383 --> 31:18.849
and some desperation
in their performances.

31:18.850 --> 31:20.682
And it's probably
just not stylistically

31:20.683 --> 31:22.882
what you even do,
you know?
I'm a little chill.

31:22.883 --> 31:24.149
Yeah, yeah.
I appreciate
what you're saying.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.382
There's nothing
wrong with that, man.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.282
It's just probably
a matter of timing for me, so...

31:27.283 --> 31:29.349
Sure thing, yeah.

31:29.350 --> 31:32.049
It's so nice to hear
an Elvis Costello song.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.249
It does immediately
show something about your taste

31:34.250 --> 31:35.816
and how good it is.
Shucks, thank you.

31:35.817 --> 31:37.449
I think it was good,
but all that aside,

31:37.450 --> 31:38.649
like, I think that,
at this point,

31:38.650 --> 31:40.082
our teams
are starting to fill up.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.116
And so I think, for me,
I was just being super picky.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.049
But I like what you did,
and I love that song,

31:44.050 --> 31:45.482
so thank you.
Thanks, man.

31:45.483 --> 31:47.616

really happen until high school.

33:14.358 --> 33:15.724
I sang for my choir.

33:15.725 --> 33:17.291
Then I graduated high school,

33:17.292 --> 33:18.724
and I went
to Virginia State University.

33:18.725 --> 33:20.557
I sang with the gospel choir.

33:20.558 --> 33:22.024
We traveled
all over the world...

33:22.025 --> 33:25.857
Italy, Germany, France, Hungary,
and I even sang in Japan.

33:25.858 --> 33:27.124
What do you do for music
right now?

33:27.125 --> 33:29.457
Well, I've been performing
for over six years now

33:29.458 --> 33:30.657
full time as an artist.

33:30.658 --> 33:33.524
I've established a large,
worldwide fan base, too,

33:33.525 --> 33:35.591
like viral videos
on YouTube.
Okay.

33:35.592 --> 33:37.057
I've been fortunate enough
to play

33:37.058 --> 33:38.957
at the Apollo Theater
in Harlem,

33:38.958 --> 33:40.391
the Blue Note in Germany,

33:40.392 --> 33:42.957
even the historic
Howard Theatre in D.C.

T-Soldiers.

33:47.958 --> 33:49.891

All right,

Self-sufficient...

33:56.492 --> 33:57.491
You're an entrepreneur.

33:57.492 --> 33:58.657
Oh, I got to be.
Yeah.

33:58.658 --> 34:01.957
The majority of my income
comes in from shows,

34:01.958 --> 34:03.691
but there's no insurance
that comes

34:03.692 --> 34:05.757
with being
an independent artist.

34:05.758 --> 34:07.924
I've seen what it's like
to sleep in a car

34:07.925 --> 34:09.391

He's put in the effort.

34:14.558 --> 34:16.291

TSoul: The first song I learned
how to play on the piano

34:20.858 --> 34:22.690
was "Fallen" by Alicia Keys.

34:22.692 --> 34:24.224
To even be able to think

34:24.225 --> 34:25.623
that she could be
a coach of mine...

34:25.625 --> 34:27.391
it's kind of mind-blowing.

I feel like "The Voice"
could change my life,

[Laughter]

45:51.817 --> 45:54.182
You are
miraculously talented.

45:54.183 --> 45:58.249
I am utterly blown away by
what you do, and let's do this.

45:58.250 --> 45:59.816
Be on my team.
Thank you so much.

45:59.817 --> 46:01.582
[Applause]

46:01.583 --> 46:02.782
Hi, Hanna.

46:02.783 --> 46:04.282
Hi.

46:04.283 --> 46:10.316
I want to find a girl that is
sparkly and talented and young,

46:10.317 --> 46:12.882
and it was, like, my dream
when I turned around

46:12.883 --> 46:14.416
and I saw you
and heard you.

46:14.417 --> 46:16.482
So, you're exactly
what I was looking for today.

46:16.483 --> 46:19.882
I have been in my band
since I was 17 years old

46:19.883 --> 46:23.049
and here I am, still,
all this time later.

46:23.050 --> 46:25.616
I clearly know
what you want to do.

46:25.617 --> 46:27.982
And I can share everything
I've done with you

46:27.983 --> 46:29.682
and we can have
so much fun together.

46:29.683 --> 46:31.549
Sounds like you just want
a friend to hang out with.

46:31.550 --> 46:33.982
[Laughter]

46:33.983 --> 46:35.082
[Applause]

46:35.083 --> 46:37.216
He's really cute,
and he's really cute,

46:37.217 --> 46:38.649
but they're both taken.

46:38.650 --> 46:40.382
She's the cutest.

46:40.383 --> 46:42.049
You should just go with me!

46:42.050 --> 46:43.782
[Applause]

46:43.783 --> 46:46.216
What a beautiful job.
You have such a beautiful voice.

46:46.217 --> 46:48.149
I loved listening to you.
Thank you.

46:48.150 --> 46:49.149
Absolutely.

46:49.150 --> 46:50.516
[Cheers and applause]

46:50.517 --> 46:51.549
Hi, Hanna.

46:51.550 --> 46:52.582
Hi.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.982
Where did you say
you were from again?

46:53.983 --> 46:55.249
Laguna Niguel,
California.

46:55.250 --> 46:57.316
Oh, yeah.
California girl.

46:57.317 --> 46:58.882
I'm from Anaheim.

46:58.883 --> 47:00.049
What's up, homey?

47:00.050 --> 47:01.916
[Laughter]

47:01.917 --> 47:03.682
What?

47:03.683 --> 47:04.682
Nerd.

47:04.683 --> 47:05.849
I know.

47:05.850 --> 47:08.516
Well, you know what?
You just have an approach

47:08.517 --> 47:12.149
that's not like anybody else
that I've ever heard.

47:12.150 --> 47:15.316
When you started singing, it
almost sounded like a lullaby.

47:15.317 --> 47:18.649
But you still had all this range
and all this power,

47:18.650 --> 47:21.249
and I just realized that maybe
that's only the tip

47:21.250 --> 47:24.016
of the iceberg with you
and what you're capable of.

47:24.017 --> 47:26.416
You have talent,
and you have this charisma.

47:26.417 --> 47:29.316
Every time you smile,
the whole room lights up.

47:29.317 --> 47:30.749
Gwen: Okay, you want to know
what he's doing right now?

47:30.750 --> 47:32.516
You see it?
Look at that.
He's doing the man thing.

47:32.517 --> 47:34.282
He's telling you
how great you are.
What are you...

47:34.283 --> 47:35.682
He is manipulating you.
Time out.

47:35.683 --> 47:37.382
No, no, no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on.

47:37.383 --> 47:38.716
Here's the deal.

47:38.717 --> 47:40.682
We got to cut this out
with the boys-and-girls stuff.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.382
It doesn't matter.
It does matter.

47:42.383 --> 47:43.916
It, like, really doesn't.
I swear.

47:43.917 --> 47:45.916
It really... It really...
Ask me and Alicia.
It matters.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.282
Listen, doesn't matter
whether we're a boy coach

47:48.283 --> 47:50.449
or whether
we're a girl coach.

47:50.450 --> 47:53.849
We're coaches,
and that is our common ground.

47:53.850 --> 47:55.216
It's a matter
of preference.

47:55.217 --> 47:56.582
Let's not try to do
this boy-girl thing.

47:56.583 --> 47:57.782
Anyway, continue.

47:57.783 --> 47:59.149
[Laughter]

47:59.150 --> 48:01.482
So, anyway, you have
this smile that...

48:01.483 --> 48:02.549
[Laughter]

48:02.550 --> 48:04.249
...it literally...
Listen to people.

48:04.250 --> 48:06.182
They giggle
when you smile.

48:06.183 --> 48:07.649
You didn't even have
to say anything.

48:07.650 --> 48:09.349
Stand there
and do that

48:09.350 --> 48:11.049
and I'm buying your record
right now.

48:11.050 --> 48:13.582
You're the kind of artist
that gets me excited

48:13.583 --> 48:15.349
about my job
on this show.

48:15.350 --> 48:17.349
Don't even listen to
anything else they have to say,

48:17.350 --> 48:19.116
because it's bullcrap.

48:19.117 --> 48:23.516
All right, Hanna,
who do you pick as your coach?

48:23.517 --> 48:25.149
Come on, Hanna.
Come on.

48:25.150 --> 48:26.816

to be that good... she's gifted.

49:24.558 --> 49:27.024
Have fun.
And so it's time
to hone her craft.

49:27.025 --> 49:28.057
Let's go meet
your family.

49:28.058 --> 49:30.424
It's so shocking
to me.

49:30.425 --> 49:31.925
I don't think you fight
hard enough.

49:33.492 --> 49:34.591
Really? No.

49:34.592 --> 49:35.591
No, I just wanted to see
the look on her face.

49:35.592 --> 49:36.591
I'm like, "Wait."

49:36.592 --> 49:37.857
I really wanted her
on my team.

49:37.858 --> 49:39.391
I really was looking for
that young girl.

49:39.392 --> 49:41.857
But today so far has been
a little bit slow for Adam,

49:41.858 --> 49:43.424
so I'm happy for him.

49:43.425 --> 49:45.057
All the way. The brothers
were all about Adam.

49:45.058 --> 49:45.857
Thank you!

49:45.858 --> 49:47.391
Awesome.
Thank you.

49:47.392 --> 49:48.424
Awesome.

49:48.425 --> 49:50.157
Congrats.
You're so great.

49:50.158 --> 49:52.424
Daly: As Adam celebrates
his first win of the night,

49:52.425 --> 49:55.891
let's see if our next artist,
26-year-old Casey Jamerson,

49:55.892 --> 49:57.124
can turn a chair.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.957
Casey: Music has just been
something that I've done

49:58.958 --> 50:00.224
since I could speak.

50:00.225 --> 50:02.491
But growing up,
sports were also a massive...

50:02.492 --> 50:04.557
even maybe so...
a bigger part of my life.

50:04.558 --> 50:06.224
I was doing cheerleading
and gymnastics.

50:06.225 --> 50:08.657
Around 4 or 5
is when I started T-ball

50:08.658 --> 50:10.524
and later on went
to fast-pitch softball.

50:10.525 --> 50:12.524
My husband
was a baseball player.

50:12.525 --> 50:15.324
I was gymnastics and
cheerleading through college,

50:15.325 --> 50:17.191
so we're very athletic.

50:17.192 --> 50:18.191
Very athletic.
Very...

50:18.192 --> 50:19.357
Competitive family.

50:19.358 --> 50:21.857
After high school,
I was given a full ride

50:21.858 --> 50:24.124
to play softball
at Indiana University.

50:24.125 --> 50:26.524
But after one semester,
I knew that

50:26.525 --> 50:28.557
it just wasn't the path
that I was meant to go down.

50:28.558 --> 50:30.091
It was a very,
very tough decision,

50:30.092 --> 50:31.491
but music was my passion.

50:31.492 --> 50:34.891
So, I took off and that's how
I came to be this.

50:34.892 --> 50:36.091
[Chuckles]

50:36.092 --> 50:38.324
I went to any showcase
that I could get into

50:38.325 --> 50:39.891
for two solid years.

50:39.892 --> 50:42.291
All of a sudden, I got
this incredible opportunity

50:42.292 --> 50:44.724
to be an original member
of a Broadway show,

50:44.725 --> 50:46.091
"Bring it On: The Musical."

50:46.092 --> 50:48.224
They needed somebody
that was a singer,

50:48.225 --> 50:49.757
a gymnast, and a cheerleader.

50:49.758 --> 50:51.757
And I just happened to fit
that role.

50:51.758 --> 50:54.057
The experience of being
on Broadway was incredible.

50:54.058 --> 50:57.091
But I've always kind of been
this, like, rock-'n'-roll girl.

50:57.092 --> 51:00.124
So, after Broadway,
I decided it's time to focus

51:00.125 --> 51:02.458
on being a rock singer.

51:03.992 --> 51:06.791
"The Voice" is so special
because you're being judged

51:06.792 --> 51:09.757
on nothing but your voice.

51:09.758 --> 51:11.924
Gwen Stefani has meant
a lot to me

51:11.925 --> 51:15.257
not only in my musical career,
but also in my fashion sense.

51:15.258 --> 51:19.824
So, to be able to sing in front
of her today is beyond an honor.

51:19.825 --> 51:21.558
I am gonna rock the stage.

52:50.758 --> 52:52.924
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!

52:52.925 --> 52:55.124
Oh, man.
What is your name?

52:55.125 --> 52:58.557
I'm Casey, I'm 26, and
I'm from Pendleton, Indiana.

52:58.558 --> 52:59.992
Oh.
Wow.

53:02.225 --> 53:03.757
Remember the Maxell tape
commercial, where the dude...

53:03.758 --> 53:04.791
Oh, yes!

53:04.792 --> 53:06.391
...and it was like
a speaker,

53:06.392 --> 53:08.424
and, like, he literally
got blown away?

53:08.425 --> 53:10.257
I-I had a hole
in my chest.

53:10.258 --> 53:11.324
I was like, "Wow!"

53:11.325 --> 53:13.024
You have an amazing power
to your voice.

53:13.025 --> 53:15.091
What I really loved, too,
was just you could tell

53:15.092 --> 53:16.624
that you were, like,
owning the room.

53:16.625 --> 53:18.691
You had a real presence
about you, and I think that...

53:18.692 --> 53:20.257
I wish I could've seen it.

53:20.258 --> 53:22.257
I'm sorry I didn't turn.
I regret it.

53:22.258 --> 53:23.657
I wanted you to turn around
so bad.

53:23.658 --> 53:26.857
I'm so sorry!
Ew, God, I hate that!

53:26.858 --> 53:28.257
You screwed the pooch.

53:28.258 --> 53:30.824
If I could say that I would,
but I would never use that term.

53:30.825 --> 53:32.991
Everything sounds grosser
when you say it, Blake.

53:32.992 --> 53:35.291
[Laughter]
"You screwed the pooch."

53:35.292 --> 53:37.591
I would just recommend
as an arranger...

53:37.592 --> 53:38.991
because I see
you're an artist...

53:38.992 --> 53:41.557
make sure there's a part
that breaks down a little bit

53:41.558 --> 53:43.891
so that people can really
understand

53:43.892 --> 53:47.157
the masterfulness
and the variety of your voice.

53:47.158 --> 53:48.291
You should come back.

53:48.292 --> 53:49.557
Hell, yeah.

53:49.558 --> 53:50.557
Thank you.

53:50.558 --> 53:53.192
[Cheers and applause]

53:54.258 --> 53:56.291
I was that close.

53:56.292 --> 54:00.057
And the performance was on
10 1/2 the whole time.

54:00.058 --> 54:01.391
Nice to meet you.
You're my idol.

54:01.392 --> 54:02.757
Thank you so much
for listening to me.

54:02.758 --> 54:05.824
But I felt like I understood her
more when I turned around.

54:05.825 --> 54:06.924
That's how it goes, right?

54:06.925 --> 54:08.624
That's why this is
the blind auditions.

54:08.625 --> 54:11.124
I have two spots left.

54:11.125 --> 54:13.891
I'm just looking for something
that's really gonna amaze me.

54:13.892 --> 54:15.624
Do you feel bad
for not turning around?

54:15.625 --> 54:18.991
I thought she was gonna be,
just, something so different.

54:18.992 --> 54:20.757
She's a really
good singer.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.391
But I think I could've done
something with that, actually.

54:23.392 --> 54:24.425
You know what I mean?

54:26.692 --> 54:28.024
Daly: Coming up...

54:28.025 --> 54:29.724
Were you not singing
right to me, though?

54:29.725 --> 54:30.757
Oh, my God!

54:30.758 --> 54:33.757
I cannot let her end
on the last word.

54:33.758 --> 54:36.224
You guys are the nicest
people to each other
when you're arguing.

54:36.225 --> 54:38.324

As our coaches get ready,

55:14.667 --> 55:17.432
let's check in
with 20-year-old Hunter Plake

55:17.433 --> 55:18.799
from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.832
I've been watching "The Voice"
ever since it came out.

55:20.833 --> 55:22.666
I just decided, you know,
I sent a video in

55:22.667 --> 55:23.866
to see what would happen.

55:23.867 --> 55:26.499
Hey, my name's Hunter,
and I'm so excited

55:26.500 --> 55:27.966
to be trying out
for "The Voice."

55:27.967 --> 55:30.966
I ended up making it and for me
to be here is amazing,

55:30.967 --> 55:33.999
especially after what I've been
through this last year.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.099
On June 10th, I married my wife,
Bethany, which was amazing.

55:38.100 --> 55:40.599
And then we moved
into our house,

55:40.600 --> 55:41.832
but just two months later,

55:41.833 --> 55:43.866
the floods
in Baton Rouge happened.

55:43.867 --> 55:47.032
Reporter: The Coast Guard
plucking panicked
residents from rooftops.

55:47.033 --> 55:50.266
Dramatic scenes in the air
and on the water.

55:50.267 --> 55:53.132
Hunter:
It took us totally by surprise.

55:53.133 --> 55:56.366
We woke up one morning
to this lady banging on our door

55:56.367 --> 55:59.766
trying to save her dog, so we
hurried up and tried to help her

55:59.767 --> 56:02.932
and get her dog on land
as quick as possible.

56:02.933 --> 56:04.666
We were forced to evacuate.

56:04.667 --> 56:07.600
It hasn't flooded
that bad in 500 years.

56:08.900 --> 56:10.199
Did you lose everything?

56:10.200 --> 56:13.966
We lost our home
and our car.
Wow.

56:13.967 --> 56:16.466
Bethany:
Thinking back on the first
two months of our marriage,

56:16.467 --> 56:20.166
it was so amazing to just
have a husband

56:20.167 --> 56:22.166
and have
our own house.

56:22.167 --> 56:28.632
And I'm just really sad
that... that is gone.

56:28.633 --> 56:31.299
After the flooding, me and my
wife moved in with my parents,

56:31.300 --> 56:32.766
and we've been there ever since,

56:32.767 --> 56:35.399
trying to figure out
what our next step is.

56:35.400 --> 56:37.499
This opportunity is amazing.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.199
The thing that I'm most nervous
about is, this is the first time

56:40.200 --> 56:43.266
I've ever sang on a stage
that's not inside of a church.

56:43.267 --> 56:47.299
So, to sing for four of the
largest artists in the world

56:47.300 --> 56:49.799
is really intimidating.

56:49.800 --> 56:51.432
I know the teams are filling up,

so I just need to focus

58:48.967 --> 58:50.899
I'm from Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, and I'm 20.

58:50.900 --> 58:53.099
I'm just so refreshed
by that song choice,

58:53.100 --> 58:54.799
'cause any Fun. song

58:54.800 --> 58:57.932
is, like, nearly impossible
for a male singer

58:57.933 --> 59:01.166
because that guy's range
is deceptively, like, crazy.

59:01.167 --> 59:03.632
And so it didn't
totally have it for me.

59:03.633 --> 59:07.466
But the good news is that
the ladies in the house tonight

59:07.467 --> 59:08.866
are all about it.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.466
Yeah.
We got it.

59:13.467 --> 59:16.499
Well, I heard it immediately
from the way that your tone was

59:16.500 --> 59:18.899
in the beginning of the song,
and what... what struck me

59:18.900 --> 59:22.799
the most was the way that is
completely a unique tone,

59:22.800 --> 59:24.232
just like a record.

59:24.233 --> 59:26.199
You were, like,
right in your strength.
Thank you.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.899
Then the falsetto
you took at the end

59:27.900 --> 59:30.699
and then the chest voice that
you blew out at the top, I mean,

59:30.700 --> 59:33.999
I feel like you have a complete,
unique, your own thing.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.466
It's a voice that I do not have
on my team,

59:36.467 --> 59:39.732
and I feel like there's songs
we can explore with your voice

59:39.733 --> 59:42.766
that's, like, anywhere you want
to go, you can sing.

59:42.767 --> 59:46.432
And so, I would love for you
to join Team Alicia.

emotionally, it feels good.

59:54.833 --> 59:56.899
I just feel like
you're so gifted.

59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.266
But also, it feels like
you want to connect the music

01:00:00.267 --> 01:00:02.532
to your heart and to the people,
and I just think

01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.666
I could relate to that and
we could relate to each other.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.866

on the last word,

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:20.066

what I have to say last.

about what feels good for you.

killer coaches for you.

and then grew and grew.

When I first started singing,
I was very shy about it.

That was really interesting.

Why don't we ask this young...
Can I ask you what your name is?

01:05:41.217 --> 01:05:42.149

We were locking eyes.

congratulations, Nala.

Thank you so much.
That's one of my favorite songs,

01:05:54.983 --> 01:05:57.082
and you definitely
performed it beautifully.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.716

congratulate you on...

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:08.649
on Gwen Stefani
turning around for you.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.716
Because you actually have
a real shot at this now,

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:14.082
because she turned
around for you.

01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:15.549
And I couldn't be happier
for you.

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:17.082
Thank you, Blake.
You're welcome.

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:18.182
Oh, Nala.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.949
When you did that dip
into the top of your...

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:22.049
like a falsetto thing,
I was like, "Oh, my God."

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.916
You know, "She can really
control her voice

01:06:23.917 --> 01:06:25.516
in this really
nerve-wracking time.

01:06:25.517 --> 01:06:27.516
Wow. That is something
I need to be a part of,

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:29.149
because this girl
has ice water in her veins

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.682
and she is ready
to do this on live TV,"

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:33.582
especially being only 17.

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:34.616

01:06:39.483 --> 01:06:41.849

right to me, though?

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.882
A little bit?

01:06:42.883 --> 01:06:43.982

a beautiful woman, Gwen.

You're Gwen Stefani.
I'm just saying, I feel...
I feel you.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:50.349
I would much rather stare into
your eyes while I was singing.

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.682
[Laughter]

01:06:51.683 --> 01:06:54.016
You just really took it on
as your own,

01:06:54.017 --> 01:06:56.616
and you understood the lyric
and the emotion of it.

01:06:56.617 --> 01:06:58.416
And one of my favorite things
that you did,

01:06:58.417 --> 01:07:00.749
which is just shocking,
to me, at 17,

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.482
that you had the patience
to actually show us

01:07:03.483 --> 01:07:05.149
all the different sides
to your voice.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:06.716
And you waited
till halfway through

01:07:06.717 --> 01:07:09.616
to give us those notes
that we all were like, "Whoa!"

01:07:09.617 --> 01:07:11.216
I think we could do
a lot together.

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:12.816

she was really great.

she can do with her voice.

and stupid Adam got her.

My name's Sammie Zonana.

01:09:13.825 --> 01:09:16.024
I'm 24 years old,
and I'm from Austin, Texas.

01:09:16.024 --> 01:09:19.124
I studied screenwriting
all through high school.

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.424
And when I got to college,
I studied film.

01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:24.057
But my freshman year,
I picked up a guitar

01:09:24.058 --> 01:09:25.957
and I started teaching myself
how to play.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.991
Not doing my homework,
just falling in love with music.

01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:31.890
Finally, I started playing
small open mics.

01:09:31.892 --> 01:09:33.524
I was totally terrified.

01:09:33.524 --> 01:09:36.224
And I actually got
a good response,

01:09:36.225 --> 01:09:39.057
and that is sort of
the tipping point.

01:09:39.058 --> 01:09:42.057
I stopped writing screenplays
and writing movies

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:46.291
and I started writing music,
and I finally recorded a single.

01:09:46.292 --> 01:09:49.256
It was the first time
I felt like an artist,

01:09:49.258 --> 01:09:51.191
like a real musician.

01:09:51.192 --> 01:09:54.324
After I graduated, for a while
I did the gigging downtown.

You know, you're downtown,
you're not making any money,

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.924
no one's really listening,
and it's really hard.

01:09:58.925 --> 01:10:02.991

and I landed on weddings.

'cause I'm engaged.

01:10:22.692 --> 01:10:25.157
I met my fiancée, Brooke,
in college.

How did
you guys meet?

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:29.591

to the sound.

01:10:35.692 --> 01:10:36.891
Right.

01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:38.557
And then she actually
came in the speed-dating event

01:10:38.558 --> 01:10:41.457
and we went on a date,
five minutes, at least.

01:10:41.458 --> 01:10:43.124
I don't even remember it.
And then she has no recollection
of it.

in high school.

experience I've ever had.

unconditionally.

My name is Sammie Zonana.

I am 24, and I'm
from Austin, Texas.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.291
Wow. Congratulations.

01:13:35.292 --> 01:13:37.191
I heard so much Gwen
in your voice.

01:13:37.192 --> 01:13:39.291
And then when she turned,
I kind of, like, just was like,

01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:42.091
"Okay, it feels like
that's what's supposed
to be happening."

01:13:42.092 --> 01:13:43.624
And you're awesome.
Good job.

01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:44.991
Well, thank you.

01:13:44.992 --> 01:13:47.057
[Cheers and applause]

01:13:47.058 --> 01:13:52.591
There is definitely
a very beautiful, particular,

01:13:52.592 --> 01:13:54.857
singular sound
in that voice.

01:13:54.858 --> 01:13:59.191
It has a huskiness that's
really bluesy and emotional.

01:13:59.192 --> 01:14:00.924
Like, you took that song
and you made it, like,

01:14:00.925 --> 01:14:02.791
a different type of place.

01:14:02.792 --> 01:14:03.824
Thank you.

01:14:03.825 --> 01:14:05.524
Really awesome.

01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:06.892
Really good.

01:14:08.525 --> 01:14:11.091
I just kept thinking
of Joni Mitchell

01:14:11.092 --> 01:14:12.491
when she was singing.

01:14:12.492 --> 01:14:14.724
I don't know what it is
about your vibe or whatever...

01:14:14.725 --> 01:14:16.991
your voice doesn't exactly
sound like her,

01:14:16.992 --> 01:14:18.424
but I couldn't
be happier.

01:14:18.425 --> 01:14:19.757
I like hanging out
with her, too,

01:14:19.758 --> 01:14:21.457
so you're gonna...
you're gonna have a lot of fun,

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.224
I promise you.
Hi, Gwen!

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.291
Welcome to Team Gwen.

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:25.291
Whoo-whoo!

01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:26.824
[Cheers and applause]

01:14:26.825 --> 01:14:29.591
You know what I loved?
You're so relaxed when you sing.

01:14:29.592 --> 01:14:32.991
There's a lot of confidence
and emotion and truth.

01:14:32.992 --> 01:14:35.457
And I feel like I could
really relate to that.

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:37.124
And right away,
I was pretty sure.

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:39.391
I was like, "I'm just gonna wait
one more second.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.257
Don't... Yeah...
Oh, I'm going."

01:14:41.258 --> 01:14:43.757
So, here I am,
and I'm so excited.

01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:45.857
Thank you so much!

01:14:45.858 --> 01:14:47.957
[Cheers and applause]

01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:48.991

[Cheers and applause]

01:14:52.392 --> 01:14:54.757
Oh, my gosh.
You're on Team Gwen now.

01:14:54.758 --> 01:14:56.591
Yes! [Grunts]

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.524
I instantly knew
that I just loved her voice.

01:14:58.525 --> 01:15:01.657
There's something innocent about
her still, and I liked all that.

01:15:01.658 --> 01:15:03.157
It's exciting. Sammie.

01:15:03.158 --> 01:15:04.191
Oh, my God!

01:15:04.192 --> 01:15:05.724
Are you kidding me?
Look at this hat.

01:15:05.725 --> 01:15:07.624
I'll wear it
to sleep tonight!

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:10.458

01:15:13.058 --> 01:15:15.157
Alicia: Yay, Gwen.
Yeah!

01:15:15.158 --> 01:15:16.191
That's a good one,
Gwen.

01:15:16.192 --> 01:15:17.357
I love her.

01:15:17.358 --> 01:15:19.524
I was very close
to rivaling you.
Yeah.

01:15:19.525 --> 01:15:20.924
But I decided to not.

01:15:20.925 --> 01:15:22.591
I would actually listen
to that voice.

01:15:22.592 --> 01:15:24.157
She's an artist.
Yeah.

Let's meet the final artist
of the night.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:57.049
Valerie:
I am from El Paso, Texas.

01:15:57.050 --> 01:16:00.049
It's a border town, and
there's Mexican country roots

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:03.782
in El Paso, so that's everything
that I do in my music.

01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:05.316
My name is Valerie Ponzio.

01:16:05.317 --> 01:16:09.716
I am 32 years old. Right?

01:16:09.717 --> 01:16:10.816
[Laughs]

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:13.449
It starts getting fuzzy
after 30.

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:16.982
I play country-Americana music.
I love the heartache.

01:16:16.983 --> 01:16:21.482
I love the underdogs
in that genre of music.

01:16:21.483 --> 01:16:24.949
I started singing
around 8 years old.

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:27.882
My mom would sew beautiful
princess costumes for me,

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.682
and I would sing all
the fairy-tale-princess songs

01:16:30.683 --> 01:16:31.982
all the time.

01:16:31.983 --> 01:16:33.949
Through high school, I focused
a little more on guitar.

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:36.482
And then I went
to Berklee College of Music.

01:16:36.483 --> 01:16:38.849
So, I've just been
full-throttle music

01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:41.749
for as long
as I can remember.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:44.949
After college, it was
kind of a confusing time.

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:48.849
I tried some odd jobs.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.216
I worked as a hostess.
I worked at a tanning salon.

01:16:51.217 --> 01:16:53.482
I worked for a moving company,
office assistant...

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:55.482
sales... and that ended.

01:16:55.483 --> 01:16:56.949
But through it all,

01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:00.882
I couldn't deny that I just
always wanted music in my life.

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:05.182
And my boyfriend, who is
an amazing musician himself,

01:17:05.183 --> 01:17:06.649
he was like, "Let's...
Let's do this.

01:17:06.650 --> 01:17:07.882
Let's hit the road together."

01:17:07.883 --> 01:17:09.982
We started a band...
Val and the Southern Line.

01:17:09.983 --> 01:17:13.549
Now, we're this
country-Americana duo
out across America.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:19.282
So, it's not always glamorous,
but it's very, very fun.

01:17:19.283 --> 01:17:21.449
Every time we were
in a town,

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:24.149
when she would sing,
it just connected with people.

01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:27.982
Just tears everywhere we were,
and I've never seen that before,

01:17:27.983 --> 01:17:30.416
ever, in all the years
that I've played music.

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:33.550
So, I am so proud of Val
for making it on "The Voice."

01:17:35.983 --> 01:17:37.949
I know the teams
are getting closer to full,

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.482
but if I could turn
a chair today,

01:17:40.483 --> 01:17:43.449
it would change everything
for me.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.616
I was so happy to hear
that Gwen was back.

01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:51.482
I idolized Gwen Stefani
since I was 16 years old,

01:17:51.483 --> 01:17:53.282
and Blake is just everything

01:17:53.283 --> 01:17:55.649
of what I want to be
in country music.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:58.682
So, if any one of those coaches
turns their chair,

01:17:58.683 --> 01:18:01.782
that would be the most
amazing feeling for me.

01:18:01.783 --> 01:18:02.916
There she goes.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.283
There she is.

Please tell us who you are.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:13.249

01:20:15.117 --> 01:20:16.749

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.082

[Cheers and applause]

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.082
Adam: I'm not joking.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:26.549
I heard at one point...
obviously Blake, because,

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.282
"Ring of Fire,"
Johnny Cash...

01:20:28.283 --> 01:20:31.349
I even heard a little Gwen
in the beginning, too.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.749
Wow.
And then when Alicia Keys
turned around,

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:36.282
it was because a very specific
moment happened...
Yeah.

01:20:36.283 --> 01:20:38.349
...where I was like, "Oh,
and there's a little Alicia."

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:41.616
And then, at the very end,
when you were screaming,

01:20:41.617 --> 01:20:42.649
I was like,
"And there I am."

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:44.416
[Laughter]

01:20:44.417 --> 01:20:46.716
Oh, when she sounded
most like a girl.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:48.849
When the female sound really
came out, that was you.
That's mean.

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:50.282
That's mean-spirited.
That's mean-spirited.

01:20:50.283 --> 01:20:52.582
You know what? Valerie and I
are not about that.

01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:54.549
We're not about that.
But you and I are.

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:55.882
But you and I
always will be,

01:20:55.883 --> 01:20:57.749
but look, don't distract
from the point here,

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:00.582
which is that you are the most
well-rounded singer, I think,

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.449
for this particular panel
of coaches...
Yeah.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:03.449
...that I've really,
kind of, every heard.

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.449
Amazing!
Thank you.

01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:06.549
Yeah.
Wow.

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:08.449
Um, thank you so much.

01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:12.716
Each and every one of you
are huge influences of mine.

01:21:12.717 --> 01:21:15.216
And, Gwen,
I idolized you growing up.

01:21:15.217 --> 01:21:18.116
Oh, son of a...
Like, I just was so
obsessed with you

01:21:18.117 --> 01:21:19.749
and I just thought you were
the... so amazing.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.149
That's crazy, 'cause I'm
actually obsessed with you now,

01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:25.749
and I would love...
I would love to work with you.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:27.217
[Laughs]

01:21:32.117 --> 01:21:33.116
Thank you.

01:21:33.117 --> 01:21:35.016
Oh, my God!

01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:36.883
[Cheers and applause]

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:43.682
It's okay.

01:21:43.683 --> 01:21:45.016
You have a little lip gloss
on there, but it's okay.

01:21:45.017 --> 01:21:45.682
You can't see it.

01:21:45.683 --> 01:21:48.016
I am fine with that.

01:21:48.017 --> 01:21:51.116
Wow, Valerie, what...
what are some of

01:21:51.117 --> 01:21:52.682
your gorgeous
influences?

01:21:52.683 --> 01:21:56.182
Well, I am a country-Americana
artist.

01:21:56.183 --> 01:21:58.249
You are a big influence
of mine.
Wow.

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.816
I have a country duo
with my boyfriend.

01:21:59.817 --> 01:22:01.282
Ooh.
I love it.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:04.016
I'd love to help you just bring
that out further...

01:22:04.017 --> 01:22:06.182
the blues and soul
and country

01:22:06.183 --> 01:22:08.116
and everything
that's inspired us,

01:22:08.117 --> 01:22:11.949
because that is what makes music
so great, that it's unlimited.

01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:14.116
So, I'd love to be
your coach, as well.

01:22:14.117 --> 01:22:16.183
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:22:17.983 --> 01:22:21.049
What an incredible voice
you have.

01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:23.816
And to hear you say
"country-Americana"...

01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:27.149
that's where I think
I can help you.

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:29.982
Nashville relationships
tend to last a lifetime.

01:22:29.983 --> 01:22:31.682
Country fans

01:22:31.683 --> 01:22:36.549
are the most loyal fans
in all of music, I-I-I think.

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:38.549
[Cheers and applause]

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:40.149
Let's not goof around
with this, sis.

01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:41.049
Uh-huh, yeah.
Let's...

01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:42.582
Let's say that
every time.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.882
[Laughter]
You're funny.

01:22:44.883 --> 01:22:46.782
I say it every time,
and I've got seasons-worth...

01:22:46.783 --> 01:22:48.882
Yep.
...of relationships
with country artists...

01:22:48.883 --> 01:22:50.849
Yes.
...that you can turn on the
radio and listen to right now.

01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:52.182
Yes, we all know.

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:57.016
Wow.
Okay, can I just
say something?

01:22:57.017 --> 01:22:59.116
I think I could be
an amazing coach for you.

01:22:59.117 --> 01:23:00.816
I think these two
could be amazing.

01:23:00.817 --> 01:23:03.382
Blake will be great,
but a lot more of the same.

01:23:03.383 --> 01:23:04.849
And I think something different
would be really cool.

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:06.716
That's all.
Thank you for that.

01:23:06.717 --> 01:23:08.216
[Cheers and applause]

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:11.749
Valerie, any time I need
any advice about country music,

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.482
I am so, so plugged in.

01:23:15.483 --> 01:23:17.349
[Laughter]

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:19.616
I don't think there's ever
any reason to think

01:23:19.617 --> 01:23:22.082
that you belong
in any stupid category.

01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:24.116
Make your decision
based on what you think

01:23:24.117 --> 01:23:26.516
will make you better and more
complete and more whole, please.

01:23:26.517 --> 01:23:28.482
In other words, whatever you do,
don't pick Blake.

01:23:28.483 --> 01:23:30.382
That's not true.
That's what all three of them
are trying to say.

01:23:30.383 --> 01:23:32.749
No, that's not
what we're saying, man.
It's absolutely,
no question

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.449
what all three of them
are saying.

01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:36.816
I think you should
just follow... totally
follow your heart.

01:23:36.817 --> 01:23:38.682
Either way, I can't wait to hear
you sing on the show.

01:23:38.683 --> 01:23:40.349
Alicia: Yeah.
You're incredible.

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.949
Valerie, who do you pick
as your coach?

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:45.549
[Audience shouting]

01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.482
Come on, Valerie!

01:23:47.483 --> 01:23:49.182
Don't fall for it!

01:23:49.183 --> 01:23:51.549
This is so much harder
than anything.

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:53.017
[Shouting continues]

01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:57.249
What do you think?
Man: I don't know.

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.116
I think Gwen.

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:01.116
I really think that the person

01:24:01.117 --> 01:24:04.082
that can take me
up to the promised land...

01:24:04.083 --> 01:24:07.082
I, um... I pick Blake.

01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:12.416

Blake:
Wow. Valerie is so unique

01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:16.449
and has so much character
in her voice.

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:17.782
I thought you were gonna fall
for that.

01:24:17.783 --> 01:24:19.982
I love that kind of
Americana storyteller

01:24:19.983 --> 01:24:21.682
kind of voice like she has.

01:24:21.683 --> 01:24:23.016
Ugh!

01:24:23.017 --> 01:24:24.182
I was a little bit heartbroken.

01:24:24.183 --> 01:24:25.582
I was the first to turn.

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:26.582
I wanted her!

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.616
Blake was the last... anyways.

01:24:28.617 --> 01:24:30.349
