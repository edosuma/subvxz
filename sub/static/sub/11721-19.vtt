00:24.414 --> 00:26.215
First man, walk to the far end,

00:26.239 --> 00:27.796
then turn towards the glass.

00:27.797 --> 00:29.983
The rest of you, fill in.

00:37.555 --> 00:39.913
Number four,
please step forward.

00:42.541 --> 00:44.728
Step back.

00:47.619 --> 00:50.633
Number five,
please step forward.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.972
Number five,
turn to your left.

01:03.323 --> 01:05.248
That's him.

01:05.251 --> 01:07.248
Are you positive?

01:09.008 --> 01:10.698
Absolutely.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.561
I'd never forget that face.

01:24.095 --> 01:26.220
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

01:26.222 --> 01:27.488
McGarrett, it's all wrong.

01:27.490 --> 01:29.544
I mean, it's like
nobody's got time

01:29.546 --> 01:31.177
to appreciate anything anymore.

01:31.179 --> 01:33.506
Take this spot
they got over on Kuhio.

01:33.508 --> 01:34.870
Calls itself "Quick Cuts."

01:34.872 --> 01:37.291
They actually advertise
that they get you in and out

01:37.293 --> 01:39.220
of the place in 15 minutes.
Mm.

01:39.222 --> 01:42.012
I mean, you go there,
different person cuts your hair

01:42.014 --> 01:43.942
every single time.

01:43.944 --> 01:47.205
There's no personal touch,
there's no familiarity.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.198
Sacrilege.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.794
Nothing wrong

01:50.796 --> 01:52.797
with a little
healthy competition.

01:52.799 --> 01:56.419
No, no, of course not,
but it's bad for the culture.

01:56.421 --> 01:58.283
You know, people forget.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.945
The barbershop is an important
social institution

02:00.947 --> 02:02.439
in this country.

02:02.441 --> 02:04.801
It's a community
gathering place.

02:04.803 --> 02:06.833
Oh, my customers--
they come here, they hang out,

02:06.835 --> 02:09.228
they talk story.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.727
No one's ever in a hurry
to leave, and you know why?

02:11.729 --> 02:13.657
It's one of the last bastions

02:13.659 --> 02:16.081
where a man can truly unplug
from the world.

02:16.083 --> 02:19.975
You know, even if it's just
for a trim and a shave.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.208
You with me, Commander?

02:23.210 --> 02:26.073
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm with you.

02:26.075 --> 02:27.767
I'm sorry.
I'm just, uh... it's...

02:27.769 --> 02:30.064
it's been a tough week.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.928
Hey, you got the couch.
I'm-I'm here to listen.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.891
No. No, no, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.886
No, no, no, no, no.

02:36.888 --> 02:39.017
Nothing's nothing-- this is
about something... come on.

02:39.019 --> 02:40.350
Well, yeah,
it's about something.

02:40.352 --> 02:42.577
It's about my mother,
is what it's about.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.876
Whoa.

02:43.878 --> 02:45.210
We all got 'em.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.005
Yeah, not like this one,
we don't.

02:47.007 --> 02:48.306
Ah, I hear you.

02:48.308 --> 02:50.205
What do you think
of the new place?

02:50.207 --> 02:51.570
I like it.
Yeah?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.797
Yeah, it's nice.

02:52.799 --> 02:55.560
More space, less rent...

02:55.562 --> 02:57.458
It's a win-win.

02:57.460 --> 03:00.882
All right,
this is cold, okay?

03:00.884 --> 03:04.286
But it's gonna help
seal up those pores.

03:04.288 --> 03:07.686
Now just relax.

03:07.688 --> 03:11.126
All right. Nice?

03:11.128 --> 03:13.061
There you go.
That's good.

03:13.063 --> 03:16.828
Then, I'm gonna give you
my special aftershave.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.931
I cut up a little hibiscus,

03:18.933 --> 03:20.930
I toss it in there.

03:20.932 --> 03:23.129
Freshens up the skin.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.306
Nice, huh?

03:26.308 --> 03:27.738
Whoa.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.138
How's that?
Feel that?

03:29.140 --> 03:31.305
Uh, yeah.
All right.

03:31.307 --> 03:32.704
That's nice.

03:32.706 --> 03:35.109
Yeah.
Real nice, buddy.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.412
<i>Mahalo a nui,</i> bruddah.

03:41.414 --> 03:42.948
<i>Mahalo a nui.</i>

03:42.950 --> 03:44.251
You open up early,

03:44.253 --> 03:46.385
you sacrifice your morning
paddle, all for my schedule.

03:46.387 --> 03:47.914
I appreciate it.
I'm touched.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.954
Hey, man, my Grandpa
Jack always said,

03:49.956 --> 03:51.891
"This is a people business."

03:51.893 --> 03:53.523
You clean up nice,
McGarrett.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.891
Not bad, huh?

03:55.893 --> 03:57.363
I like to think of
myself as an artist.

03:57.365 --> 03:58.764
You know, some canvases
are better than others.

03:58.766 --> 04:01.068
Speaking of which,
I would love

04:01.070 --> 04:02.604
to get my shears on
that partner of yours.

04:02.606 --> 04:04.571
Oh...
That cat got a hell of a head of hair.

04:04.573 --> 04:06.066
I've been chasing him around

04:06.068 --> 04:07.705
with a pair of scissors
for five years now.

04:07.707 --> 04:09.769
He's very precious
about that do.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.273
Trust me, but he'll be
back in a week.

04:11.275 --> 04:13.641
I'll tell him you offered.
Solid.

04:13.643 --> 04:16.882
So, what are we gonna do today?

04:16.884 --> 04:18.218
High and tight.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.051
And don't touch the burns, right?
Yeah.

04:21.885 --> 04:23.923
Please, you got to help me.

04:25.157 --> 04:27.123
They're coming to kill me.

Blue Silverado

My cell phone's in there,

we may have a problem.

05:38.369 --> 05:40.602
Keep pressure on
this, all right?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.349
Yeah, we definitely
have a problem.

05:47.652 --> 05:49.021
Oh, no. That's them!

05:49.023 --> 05:51.597
Take him behind the wall there,
and stay down; stay down.

05:54.565 --> 05:56.499
Stay where you are.

05:56.501 --> 06:00.101
This is Commander McGarrett
of Five-O.

06:00.103 --> 06:02.806
Drop your weapons.

06:45.992 --> 06:48.191
We just want the kid.

06:49.529 --> 06:52.568
Hand him over,
and we walk away.

06:55.107 --> 06:57.505
That's not gonna happen!

07:12.122 --> 07:15.224
You know the story of
the three little pigs,

07:15.226 --> 07:16.855
Commander McGarrett?

07:20.097 --> 07:23.198
Then you know this is going
to end badly for you.

07:44.642 --> 07:47.515
How can you not have a phone?

07:47.517 --> 07:49.979
All my regulars have
standing appointments.

07:49.981 --> 07:51.452
The rest are walk-ins, okay?

07:51.454 --> 07:53.316
How could you leave yours
in the car, Commander?!

07:53.318 --> 07:54.620
'Cause this is the barbershop.

07:54.622 --> 07:56.020
This is where we come to unplug
from the rest of the world,

07:56.022 --> 07:58.061
do you remember?!
Oh, yeah. Now,

07:58.063 --> 07:59.292
you're gonna use my words
against me?

07:59.294 --> 08:01.260
Nice. Kid, you got a phone?

08:02.030 --> 08:04.365
No.
Of course not.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.837
Some days are just born bad!

08:13.346 --> 08:14.880
Oh. Thank God, Chin.

08:14.882 --> 08:17.313
Look, I had nothing to do
with these home invasions.

08:17.315 --> 08:18.586
I'm being railroaded here.

08:18.588 --> 08:20.851
You got to believe me!
Relax, Jer.

08:20.853 --> 08:22.356
Eyewitnesses are unreliable,

08:22.358 --> 08:24.923
and Duke told me that
you were just a plant.

08:24.925 --> 08:26.228
Nobody thinks you're guilty.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.331
We just need to play this out.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.635
This is what I get for trying
to make a little extra coin.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.067
25 bucks to be
a lineup stand-in,

08:33.068 --> 08:34.498
and now I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life in the joint.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.664
You are not going to jail, Jer.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.967
We just have to provide
HPD with an alibi, so,

08:39.970 --> 08:41.735
were you with
anybody last night

08:41.736 --> 08:43.374
between the hours of
8:00 and 10:00 p.m.?

08:43.376 --> 08:45.877
Yeah, I-I was with Max.

08:45.879 --> 08:48.276
Perfect. Great.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.044
So, sit tight, I'll be back.

08:50.046 --> 08:53.244
And from now on,
no more lineups, okay?

08:53.246 --> 08:54.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.052
What do you mean,
you'll be back?

08:56.054 --> 08:57.149
You're leaving me here?!

08:57.151 --> 08:58.350
SOP, Jer. HPD is gonna want

08:58.352 --> 09:00.287
to keep you here
until your alibi checks out.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.591
No, no, listen to me good, Chin.

09:01.593 --> 09:02.960
You walk out that door,

09:02.962 --> 09:04.429
you may as well
find yourself another roomie.

09:04.431 --> 09:05.757
I've watched enough
<i>Locked Up Abroad</i>

09:05.759 --> 09:07.291
to know I'll be doing 30 years

09:07.293 --> 09:09.393
for a crime
I didn't commit.

09:09.395 --> 09:11.328
I'll be like the next Hurricane,
which would be cool

09:11.330 --> 09:12.832
if Bob Dylan wrote
a song about me.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.967
Bob Dylan is not gonna
write a song about you.

09:15.969 --> 09:17.934
You're right.

09:17.936 --> 09:19.934
His recent work's
less political.

09:19.936 --> 09:21.206
It's more introspective.

09:23.574 --> 09:27.205
Just promise me
you'll look after my mom for me.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.181
I promise.

09:37.222 --> 09:39.221
Now try to relax.

09:39.223 --> 09:41.356
I'll be back.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.367
How's his leg?

09:54.137 --> 09:55.576
Still bleeding, man.

09:55.578 --> 09:58.174
You got to pack that wound, and
then put more pressure on it.

09:58.176 --> 10:00.076
Pack? Pack with what?

10:00.078 --> 10:01.973
What do you got?
You got gauze out there?

10:01.975 --> 10:03.447
What?
Cotton balls.

10:03.449 --> 10:05.079
There's cotton balls
right here on the counter.

10:05.081 --> 10:07.122
Hey, bring 'em in!
Come and get the cotton balls!

10:17.838 --> 10:20.068
All right, listen...
I'm sorry, kid.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.836
I got kicked out of
the Boy Scouts for smoking weed.

10:22.838 --> 10:24.973
Okay? I never done this before.

10:24.975 --> 10:27.476
But okay, okay? Is that all right?
Uh-huh.

10:27.478 --> 10:29.379
Here we go. All right,
here we go.

10:29.381 --> 10:31.243
Easy, easy, easy.

10:35.577 --> 10:38.782
You must be running low
on ammo, Commander.

10:38.784 --> 10:41.045
You can't hold us off forever.

10:41.047 --> 10:43.084
Save yourself.

10:43.086 --> 10:44.882
Give us the kid.

10:44.884 --> 10:47.352
HPD's gonna be here
in a minute!

10:47.354 --> 10:51.425
And trust me,
they won't be low on rounds.

10:57.128 --> 10:59.389
I don't think
they bought that.

11:10.599 --> 11:13.164
Where's this door lead?

11:13.166 --> 11:14.837
Hallway to the back door.

11:16.408 --> 11:18.542
All right, we got to get Eran
to the hospital,

11:18.544 --> 11:21.141
all right?
I'm gonna lay down cover fire,

11:21.143 --> 11:22.444
you guys get out of here.

11:22.446 --> 11:24.108
What are you, insane?
You're not gonna come with us?

11:24.110 --> 11:26.378
Their guns are bigger
than yours, man.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.273
The minute I turn my back and
stop firing on these guys,

11:28.275 --> 11:29.377
they're gonna come in here

11:29.379 --> 11:30.545
and they're gonna kill us,
you understand?

11:30.547 --> 11:33.146
They're gonna track us down
and kill us.

11:33.148 --> 11:34.618
By now, somebody would have
called in these shots fired.

11:34.620 --> 11:37.384
I got enough ammo to hold 'em
off until HPD arrives.

11:37.386 --> 11:40.151
Well, what if nobody called the cops?
Why are you arguing with me?

11:40.153 --> 11:41.623
This kid's losing blood while

11:41.625 --> 11:42.855
you're arguing with me,
he's gonna die

11:42.857 --> 11:44.357
if you don't get him to the hospital.
Okay, all right.

11:44.359 --> 11:45.724
I guess we're going, kid.
You okay?

11:45.726 --> 11:47.156
One...
One...

11:47.158 --> 11:48.323
Let's go.

11:48.325 --> 11:49.723
Two...
Two!

11:49.725 --> 11:51.027
Come on.
Three.

11:51.029 --> 11:53.260
Three. Let's go!

11:58.933 --> 12:00.708
All right, here we go.

12:04.578 --> 12:06.713
Abort! Abort!

12:17.287 --> 12:18.788
Easy.

12:29.702 --> 12:31.574
Okay, easy,
easy, easy.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.976
All right, all right,
all right... sit down.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.585
All right, all right.

12:39.587 --> 12:40.986
I'm gonna fix that.

12:40.988 --> 12:42.890
Okay.
I'm gonna fix that.

12:48.095 --> 12:49.662
What are you doing back here?

12:49.664 --> 12:51.198
Why are you here?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.533
I came to say good-bye.

12:53.535 --> 12:55.333
They got guys out back.

12:55.335 --> 12:58.100
I secured the door
but we can't go out that way.

13:07.247 --> 13:09.548
How long till those cops
you were talking about show up?

13:09.550 --> 13:11.684
I don't know.
It's a commercial area.

13:11.686 --> 13:13.651
You're the only store
open right now.

13:13.653 --> 13:15.450
The closest residential
isn't for a few blocks.

13:15.452 --> 13:17.386
So I'm thinking the HPD's
gonna take a few minutes

13:17.388 --> 13:20.394
to pinpoint our exact location.
Seriously? I think

13:20.396 --> 13:22.291
it's safe to say we're
the only shop on the Island

13:22.293 --> 13:24.628
that's under siege
right now.

13:25.334 --> 13:26.731
How you doing on ammo?

13:27.701 --> 13:29.771
I think I got about
three rounds left.

13:29.773 --> 13:31.667
Well, can we
recycle these things?

13:31.669 --> 13:34.107
There's like
a million of 'em in here.

13:34.109 --> 13:35.739
I'm gonna pretend

13:35.741 --> 13:37.579
you didn't just say that.
Okay, I'm just

13:37.581 --> 13:38.644
trying to help, all right?

13:38.646 --> 13:39.980
Okay, you want to help?

13:39.982 --> 13:41.646
Find us a way out of here.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.687
The gate. We can
secure ourselves inside.

13:46.689 --> 13:49.624
What gate?

13:49.626 --> 13:52.295
I got a security gate outside.
It rolls down at night

13:52.297 --> 13:54.429
to keep the undesirables
outside of my shop.

13:54.431 --> 13:55.997
Okay, I'm gonna ask
you a question.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.164
What do you call these, huh?

13:57.166 --> 13:58.596
What do you call
these guys out the front

13:58.598 --> 14:00.602
with the big guns? Huh?
Okay, forgive me

14:00.604 --> 14:02.936
for not mentioning it sooner,
all right? I'm not exactly

14:02.938 --> 14:04.902
thinking straight.
It's not every day I have

14:04.904 --> 14:06.429
bullets flying at my head.
All right,

14:06.431 --> 14:08.100
all right.

14:08.102 --> 14:11.605
Is it automatic?
Tell me it's automatic.

14:11.607 --> 14:13.773
What do you think?

14:15.079 --> 14:17.477
All right, all I need
is to open the front door,

14:17.479 --> 14:18.781
pull the gate down, that's it.

14:18.783 --> 14:21.277
All right, move fast,
keep your head down.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.949
Inspiring words, thank you.

14:23.951 --> 14:25.181
On my mark.

14:25.183 --> 14:26.718
I don't know what that means.
It means

14:26.720 --> 14:27.758
when I say go, go.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.358
Well say that, then.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.262
Okay, when I say go... go.

14:31.264 --> 14:33.295
Good.

14:33.297 --> 14:36.264
One, two...

14:36.266 --> 14:38.471
three.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.493
Fast enough for you?

14:56.495 --> 14:59.198
That was good, that was fast.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.629
But you didn't say "go".
You said, "One, two, three."

15:01.631 --> 15:03.501
You said
you were gonna say "go".

15:03.503 --> 15:07.068
You're right, I'm sorry.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.235
Hey, Max.
Oh.

15:12.772 --> 15:15.504
Oh, Lieutenant Kelly.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

15:15.506 --> 15:17.873
What, you win
a scratch-off lotto, Max?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.009
Me? No, no, uh, just another

15:20.011 --> 15:22.050
successful sale on eBay.

15:22.052 --> 15:25.187
You get cash
for your eBay sales?

15:25.189 --> 15:28.187
It's an option.
Lieutenant, is there

15:28.189 --> 15:30.227
anything I can
assist you with?

15:30.229 --> 15:31.491
Actually, yes.
Uh, you

15:31.493 --> 15:33.827
were with Jerry last night and I...
Jerry Ortega?

15:34.797 --> 15:36.498
Uh... Y... No, I wasn't.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.161
I'm afraid I wasn't
with him at all.

15:38.163 --> 15:40.568
I haven't seen him for-for a week...
Max. Max, Jerry said

15:40.570 --> 15:43.103
that the two of you were
together and he is in trouble.

15:43.105 --> 15:45.765
It's very important that you
tell me the truth right now.

15:45.767 --> 15:46.900
What kind of trouble?

15:46.902 --> 15:49.668
I'm asking
the questions, Max.

15:51.837 --> 15:54.442
Fine. Um... we were together.

15:54.444 --> 15:57.008
There was a <i> Magic:</i>
<i>The Gathering</i> tournament.

15:57.010 --> 15:59.841
I was merely there to witness
the impressive skill

15:59.843 --> 16:01.409
and gamesmanship of the players,

16:01.411 --> 16:03.047
while Mr. Ortega

16:03.049 --> 16:05.979
had... gambling on his mind.

16:05.981 --> 16:08.209
And you gambled, too.

16:08.211 --> 16:10.450
Oh, uh, I-I was gonna
deposit the cash after work.

16:10.452 --> 16:13.388
Uh, I... I-I'm not
proud of it...

16:14.526 --> 16:16.524
but I can't deny being swept up

16:16.526 --> 16:18.428
in the competitive atmosphere.

16:18.430 --> 16:19.891
I mean, the athletics on display

16:19.893 --> 16:21.795
were top-notch and one
of the Planeswalkers

16:21.797 --> 16:22.621
was riding a hot hand.

16:22.645 --> 16:24.429
You could just keep on...
I have no idea what you're

16:24.430 --> 16:26.229
talking about and I don't care
about the gambling.

16:26.231 --> 16:28.405
Jerry has been accused

16:28.407 --> 16:29.571
of a string of home invasions.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.298
One of which occurred
last night while

16:31.300 --> 16:31.954
the two of you were
at your magic show.

16:31.978 --> 16:32.969
Tournament.

16:32.970 --> 16:35.336
Whatever. You're his alibi, Max.

16:35.338 --> 16:37.504
I need you to give
a statement to HPD.

16:37.506 --> 16:40.742
Of course. I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to help Jerry.

16:40.744 --> 16:42.110
Great.

16:42.112 --> 16:43.741
Provided the gambling

16:43.743 --> 16:46.148
doesn't go on my
exemplary record.

16:47.278 --> 16:50.085
I'll tell you what--

16:50.087 --> 16:52.989
You make a donation to the
HPD Widow and Orphans Fund

16:52.991 --> 16:54.821
and we'll just
keep it between us.

16:54.823 --> 16:56.557
You mean a percentage.

16:56.559 --> 16:58.221
All of it.

16:58.223 --> 17:00.892
That's what I meant.

17:05.797 --> 17:07.300
Drink this.

17:07.301 --> 17:10.236
Drink it. You got to stay
hydrated, all right?

17:18.013 --> 17:20.515
Am I... Am I gonna die?

17:20.517 --> 17:21.978
No, you're not gonna die.

17:21.980 --> 17:24.913
We're gonna get you
through this, all right?

17:24.915 --> 17:27.113
Here.
Perfect.

17:27.115 --> 17:28.784
Wh... What is that?

17:28.786 --> 17:30.920
It's a styptic pen.
It's used to stop bleeding.

17:30.922 --> 17:34.623
Usually just nicks from shaves,
but, uh, it might help.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.358
It's gonna burn like hell,
though, all right?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.788
We're gonna give it a try.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.986
All right.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.159
All right, that's good.

17:45.161 --> 17:47.390
That's good. Look at me, Eran,
look at me. Look at me,

17:47.392 --> 17:49.262
look at me.
It hurts.

17:49.264 --> 17:50.462
Yeah, I know.
I know it hurts,

17:50.464 --> 17:51.934
but you got to forget about
that, though, okay?

17:51.936 --> 17:53.766
Forget about the pain.
Think about something else.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.470
This morning-- what
happened this morning, Eran?

17:55.472 --> 17:58.007
Talk to me about this morning.
Everything you remember.

17:58.009 --> 18:01.609
Um... Um... I-I work

18:01.611 --> 18:03.145
the a.m. shift at the...

18:03.147 --> 18:05.449
at the Hoapili Bakery
on Palolo Avenue.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.280
Okay.
I...

18:07.282 --> 18:10.414
I, uh, I went out back
to dump the trash

18:10.416 --> 18:12.012
from the overnight crew
and I saw

18:12.014 --> 18:14.619
a couple of men in the alley.

18:14.621 --> 18:18.154
They... They were
beating on this guy.

18:18.156 --> 18:20.186
But they... they didn't
know I was there.

18:20.188 --> 18:22.153
What happened after that?

18:23.794 --> 18:25.127
They...

18:25.129 --> 18:26.655
They executed him.

18:26.657 --> 18:29.990
Just... shot him

18:29.992 --> 18:31.526
right in the head.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.261
I-I panicked,
dropped the trash,

18:35.263 --> 18:37.701
and... they saw me.

18:37.703 --> 18:40.772
So I ran as fast as I could.

18:40.774 --> 18:42.741
I keep thinking

18:42.743 --> 18:44.974
I should have done something.

18:44.976 --> 18:46.845
You know? Maybe...

18:46.847 --> 18:48.477
Maybe that guy
would still be alive.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.916
Listen to me,

18:49.918 --> 18:52.578
these men that you saw in the
alley-- did you recognize them?

18:52.580 --> 18:56.344
Yeah, but I...

18:56.346 --> 18:58.215
I don't know
any of their names.

18:58.217 --> 19:00.287
Just-Just that they're part
of some Armenian gang.

19:00.289 --> 19:01.854
They pretty much run
my whole neighborhood.

19:01.856 --> 19:04.357
Now they know where I work,

19:04.359 --> 19:07.324
my face...

19:07.326 --> 19:11.091
Even if I get out of this...

19:11.093 --> 19:12.427
I'm dead.
No, you're not.

19:12.429 --> 19:14.762
I'm not gonna
let that happen, all right?

19:15.859 --> 19:17.361
And you're not
bleeding anymore, either.

19:17.363 --> 19:18.695
That's two bits of good news.

19:18.697 --> 19:21.431
You got any duct tape?
Who doesn't have duct tape?

19:21.433 --> 19:23.137
Okay, get me a roll of duct
tape, get me a fresh towel,

19:23.139 --> 19:24.673
all right?
You got it.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.441
How you doing?
You all right?

19:26.443 --> 19:28.136
Hey, you're doing great.

19:28.138 --> 19:30.103
All right.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.250
McGarrett.

19:43.188 --> 19:45.562
You all right?

19:49.299 --> 19:51.298
You, uh... ever hear

19:51.300 --> 19:53.268
the name Garig Dobrian?

19:53.270 --> 19:54.774
No.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.805
Used to be a major player
in the Armenian Mob in L.A.,

19:57.807 --> 20:00.371
moved down here a few years ago
to hang his own shingle.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.777
Word is he's ruthless.

20:02.779 --> 20:04.913
Drugs, shakedowns,
insurance scams--

20:04.915 --> 20:06.976
got his hands in all of it.

20:06.978 --> 20:08.982
He owns the Rainbow
Valley Supermarket

20:08.984 --> 20:11.277
over on Palolo Avenue, but, uh,

20:11.279 --> 20:13.515
that place is just a front.

20:13.517 --> 20:15.025
Wait a minute, you think
Dobrian had something to do

20:15.049 --> 20:16.178
with this guy getting killed?

20:16.179 --> 20:19.313
Well, nothing gets done
without him giving the order.

20:19.315 --> 20:23.018
And if he's the one who told
these guys to come after Eran,

20:23.020 --> 20:26.320
they ain't gonna stop
till he's dead.

20:30.498 --> 20:32.160
That can't be good.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.663
He's coming over here.
I'm gonna open the gate.

20:36.665 --> 20:38.767
You shoot him.
What am I gonna shoot him with?

20:38.769 --> 20:40.871
I don't have any bullets.

20:46.006 --> 20:47.603
What the hell's he doing?

21:06.652 --> 21:08.890
Central to 2 Bravo 156.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.187
Anonymous 911 callers
reporting gunfire

21:11.189 --> 21:13.598
in the vicinity of the
1200 block of Queen Street.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.537
Calls being received
as far away as the 2000 block.

21:17.539 --> 21:21.572
156, 10-4 from Ward and Queen.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.581
Great, great, great, great,
great, great, great.

21:32.257 --> 21:35.560
See this mug?
I got this in Munich.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.831
I spent the evening
with one of the most beautiful

21:37.833 --> 21:39.494
frauleins I'd ever seen.

21:39.496 --> 21:41.566
One of the top five
nights of my life.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.901
I...
Shh.

21:42.903 --> 21:45.469
You hear something?

21:45.471 --> 21:48.542
No.
Well, why are you shushing me?

21:48.544 --> 21:50.575
Because I'm trying
to hear something.

21:54.251 --> 21:56.650
Really sorry I dragged
you into this.

21:56.652 --> 21:59.091
Uh, you... you were the
only place open. I-I didn't

21:59.093 --> 22:00.587
have anywhere else to go.

22:00.589 --> 22:02.356
Don't sweat it, kid.

22:02.358 --> 22:04.324
It's all just stuff.

22:04.326 --> 22:07.429
Nothing that can't be replaced.

22:07.431 --> 22:11.131
Hey, you're lucky
you stumbled in here.

22:11.133 --> 22:14.431
You got Hawaii's finest
on your side.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.100
Now we just need
some of that luck

22:16.102 --> 22:17.900
to get us the hell out of here.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.300
Bravo 156 going portable
at the 1200 block.

22:38.302 --> 22:41.137
10-4, Bravo 156.

22:41.139 --> 22:44.240
Cops. Thank God.

22:44.242 --> 22:46.408
No, no, there's something...
something's not right.

22:52.481 --> 22:54.382
Something's not right.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.517
They knew I was a cop, they
didn't hesitate to open fire.

22:56.519 --> 22:58.180
What, now they're just
gonna let one roll up?

22:58.182 --> 22:59.620
Well, maybe they saw him
coming and took off.

22:59.622 --> 23:00.957
No way. No way.
Buddy, hey! Hey!

23:00.959 --> 23:02.621
Hey, buddy,
get out of there!

23:02.623 --> 23:04.463
- Get out of there!
- It's a trap! It's a...

23:11.097 --> 23:14.104
Hm.

23:14.106 --> 23:18.746
Central to 156.
What's your status?

23:18.748 --> 23:20.074
Put him in the trunk.

23:23.620 --> 23:26.312
What's your status?
What's your status?

23:30.582 --> 23:33.387
156 to Dispatch.

23:33.389 --> 23:35.250
We have a 10-8 60.

23:35.252 --> 23:38.090
All right, 10-4, 156.
You're good to go. Go.

23:38.092 --> 23:41.691
Hey, what...
what's 10-8 60 mean?

23:43.533 --> 23:46.192
It means no one else is coming.

23:47.793 --> 23:49.830
Great.

23:49.832 --> 23:51.995
Just great.

23:55.961 --> 23:58.167
Get rid of it.

24:03.168 --> 24:06.238
<i>So I sent Max down to HPD</i>

24:06.240 --> 24:08.141
to give his statement,
and I started looking

24:08.143 --> 24:10.773
into these home invasions
that Jerry's been accused of.

24:10.775 --> 24:12.309
There's a disturbing trend.

24:12.311 --> 24:14.813
All three women were robbed
over the past few days,

24:14.815 --> 24:16.645
and each incident was more
violent than the one before it.

24:16.647 --> 24:18.812
Last night's victim
was sent to the hospital

24:18.814 --> 24:20.978
with a fractured skull.
She's still in the ICU.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.385
We gotta stop this
before the next victim

24:23.387 --> 24:24.924
ends up on a metal
slab in front of Max.

24:24.948 --> 24:25.890
Okay,

24:25.891 --> 24:27.322
so what do we know
about the victims?

24:27.324 --> 24:29.323
Well, they all live in
different neighborhoods,

24:29.325 --> 24:30.996
they all work in different
fields; two of the three

24:30.998 --> 24:32.332
grew up on the mainland.

24:32.334 --> 24:34.100
But they do have
one thing in common.

24:34.102 --> 24:36.763
They're all recently
divorced and living alone.

24:36.765 --> 24:38.932
Safe and easy targets.

24:38.934 --> 24:40.466
Okay, so, two divorced women
is a coincidence.

24:40.468 --> 24:42.137
Three is a pattern.
That must be how

24:42.139 --> 24:43.233
he's choosing them.

24:43.235 --> 24:44.736
So, the next step
is figuring out

24:44.738 --> 24:46.376
how our guy knows that
they're all recently divorced.

24:46.378 --> 24:49.146
Well, divorce records are filed
down at the family court.

24:49.148 --> 24:50.810
Whoever did this
probably has access.

24:56.354 --> 24:58.617
Look at that.

24:58.619 --> 25:01.856
All three women used the exact
same law firm--

25:01.858 --> 25:04.023
Kaio and Reed.

25:05.225 --> 25:08.862
Somebody inside
that law firm is behind this.

25:13.092 --> 25:15.826
Morning.

25:18.503 --> 25:20.870
$180.65.

25:27.511 --> 25:29.444
Eran ain't looking
too good, man.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.547
Yeah, that's why we got to
get him the hell out of here.

25:32.549 --> 25:34.282
Where's that lead to?
That's the A/C unit.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.386
I'm telling you, there's only
two ways out of here.

25:36.388 --> 25:37.850
Okay, listen to
me, all right?

25:37.852 --> 25:39.522
The HPD is not
coming anytime soon,

25:39.524 --> 25:40.922
which means
we're on our own.

25:40.924 --> 25:42.994
And waiting any more
is no longer an option.

25:42.996 --> 25:44.090
The longer we stay here,

25:44.092 --> 25:46.025
the better the chance
we all end up dead.

25:46.027 --> 25:47.160
Okay, what are you gonna do?

25:47.162 --> 25:48.663
You gonna crawl
through the, uh, air duct?

25:48.665 --> 25:50.462
Yes, if I have to, yes.

25:50.464 --> 25:51.862
There's a store
next door, right?

25:51.864 --> 25:53.198
A florist.
I'm thinking

25:53.200 --> 25:55.534
this connects to the florist,
and if I can get over there,

25:55.536 --> 25:58.605
maybe I can use <i> their</i>
phone and call 911.

25:58.607 --> 25:59.701
You see where I'm going
with this?

25:59.703 --> 26:01.605
Help me.

26:01.607 --> 26:04.309
Oh...
Careful. Please.

26:04.311 --> 26:06.477
I'm sorry. All right?

26:10.280 --> 26:11.885
What is this?
You're a lawyer?

26:11.887 --> 26:14.317
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a lawyer.
Is that so hard to believe?

26:14.319 --> 26:18.486
Well, I mean, it's a
barbershop, so, yeah, kinda.

26:18.488 --> 26:20.558
I just blew your mind,
didn't I?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.359
You know, most people hang
it on the wall, you know.

26:22.361 --> 26:23.758
Yeah, well, I'm not
too fond of mine,

26:23.760 --> 26:25.030
and I just haven't
had the nerve

26:25.032 --> 26:27.166
to toss it in the trash
where it belongs, okay?

26:27.168 --> 26:28.767
There's a story there.

26:28.769 --> 26:30.238
There's a long
and boring story there,

26:30.240 --> 26:32.205
one that ends up
with me owning a barbershop

26:32.207 --> 26:33.973
on a rock in the middle
of the Pacific.

26:33.975 --> 26:35.574
Do me a favor?
You got a Phillips?

26:35.576 --> 26:37.774
Uh, yeah.

26:38.943 --> 26:41.909
So, what, you spend 100 grand
on a degree,

26:41.911 --> 26:44.075
but you realize
you like breaking the law

26:44.077 --> 26:45.410
more than practicing it?

26:45.412 --> 26:47.209
I think we're done
talking about this.

26:47.211 --> 26:48.053
What are you talking about?

26:48.077 --> 26:49.619
I told you about my mother.
You didn't tell me

26:49.620 --> 26:51.483
anything about
your mother.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.692
Okay, well, she aided
and abetted a man

26:53.694 --> 26:56.325
who was trying to kill me
for years, and then

26:56.327 --> 26:58.293
she went into hiding...

26:58.295 --> 26:59.660
so I couldn't call her on it.

26:59.662 --> 27:01.996
Your turn.

27:03.799 --> 27:06.204
My father's a big-shot
defense attorney.

27:06.206 --> 27:08.339
Park Avenue penthouse,
summers in the Hamptons,

27:08.341 --> 27:09.707
first-class everything.

27:09.709 --> 27:12.241
But that's not where
he came from, and he resented

27:12.243 --> 27:14.504
the fact that he
was a barber's son.

27:14.506 --> 27:17.210
He didn't consider that
a noble profession.

27:17.212 --> 27:19.178
All that matters to him is
how much money you make.

27:19.180 --> 27:22.949
He sent me to all the best
schools-- Horace Mann, NYU,

27:22.951 --> 27:24.423
Fordham Law.

27:24.425 --> 27:26.455
Didn't matter
what I wanted.

27:26.457 --> 27:28.359
He was calling the shots.

27:28.361 --> 27:31.166
After I graduated,
I had enough--<i> wela ka hao.</i>

27:31.168 --> 27:33.230
Life's too short, huh?
Yeah.

27:33.232 --> 27:35.431
Getting shorter
by the minute.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.333
That is not encouraging.

27:38.335 --> 27:40.101
No. It's, uh...

27:40.103 --> 27:42.174
it's too small a space
for me to fit into.

27:42.176 --> 27:43.310
So what are we gonna do?

27:45.114 --> 27:47.417
Uh, guys...?

27:47.419 --> 27:50.419
Guys!

27:51.621 --> 27:53.020
They're coming in.

27:53.022 --> 27:54.390
What?

27:54.392 --> 27:56.072
What do you mean
"They're coming in."? How?

28:00.272 --> 28:02.702
We need to get him
into the storage room.

28:02.704 --> 28:03.605
Let's go.

28:03.607 --> 28:05.133
Ready?
Up, up.

28:05.135 --> 28:07.309
Go!

28:24.983 --> 28:27.272
You sure this is gonna work?

28:27.273 --> 28:28.807
Hair dye's got peroxide.

28:28.809 --> 28:30.541
Aftershave's,
like, 60% alcohol.

28:30.543 --> 28:31.941
Might as well
be Scotch.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.540
Trust me,
it's gonna burn.

28:33.542 --> 28:35.043
So you're a barber,
you're a lawyer,

28:35.045 --> 28:36.242
and you're an explosives expert?

28:36.244 --> 28:37.609
Yeah, my Grandpa Jack

28:37.611 --> 28:39.576
was a barber stationed
in England during WWII.

28:39.578 --> 28:41.511
Uncle Sam liked
the boys cleaned up

28:41.513 --> 28:43.878
before heading to
the front lines.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.814
He was assigned to the
Combat Demolition Unit.

28:45.816 --> 28:46.886
One of his regulars
taught him

28:46.888 --> 28:48.488
how to make a
Molotov Cocktail

28:48.490 --> 28:50.354
using hair dye
and aftershave.

28:50.356 --> 28:51.890
Jack always said,

28:51.892 --> 28:54.561
"A piece of knowledge is
better than a good tip."

28:54.563 --> 28:57.191
Good thing
you were paying attention, huh?

29:01.698 --> 29:04.167
There we go. Done.

29:05.401 --> 29:07.640
I'm a pacifist.
She's all yours.

29:07.642 --> 29:09.872
You got a light?

29:09.874 --> 29:11.712
Good luck.

29:47.855 --> 29:49.787
Odell!

29:49.789 --> 29:52.082
Huh? We gotta move! Come on!

29:55.858 --> 29:57.391
Mahalo, Grandpa Jack.

30:00.057 --> 30:02.262
Neighbors are gonna be pissed.

30:02.264 --> 30:04.029
All right, here, here.

30:04.031 --> 30:06.494
This is Commander McGarrett
of Five-O.

30:06.496 --> 30:08.735
I have a 10-15
at 1284 Queen Street.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.904
I need an ambulance
and all available units.

30:14.338 --> 30:16.407
McGarrett!

30:20.374 --> 30:22.178
Okay.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.242
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

30:24.244 --> 30:25.410
You're gonna be fine.

30:25.412 --> 30:27.178
But we got no time
to wait for an ambulance.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.451
Where's your car?
Across the street.

30:30.453 --> 30:31.755
Follow me.

30:32.758 --> 30:34.956
Let's go.

30:37.694 --> 30:39.196
All right, guys,
just hang in there.

30:39.198 --> 30:41.364
It's almost over.

30:50.310 --> 30:52.276
All right, listen to me--

30:52.278 --> 30:54.643
get him to King's
Medical Center

30:54.645 --> 30:56.913
and take this, just in case.
I told you,

30:56.915 --> 30:59.208
I'm a pacifist.
I don't do guns.

30:59.210 --> 31:01.016
Today, you do guns.
Take it.

31:03.481 --> 31:06.811
You're going after
Garig Dobrian, aren't you?

31:07.652 --> 31:09.113
Yeah.

31:09.115 --> 31:10.944
Be careful, brutha.

31:10.946 --> 31:12.648
Now, go.

31:23.860 --> 31:26.225
So I hear you had a very
interesting phone call

31:26.227 --> 31:28.193
the other night.

31:28.195 --> 31:30.793
Gabriel Waincroft.

31:30.795 --> 31:33.232
Guy thinks he did me a
favor by killing Coughlin.

31:33.234 --> 31:34.360
He did.

31:34.362 --> 31:36.734
By murdering that detective
and then disappearing,

31:36.736 --> 31:38.966
he single-handedly ended IA's
investigation against you.

31:38.968 --> 31:41.037
You know that sick
son of a bitch is gonna

31:41.039 --> 31:42.501
want something
for it now, right?

31:44.371 --> 31:45.371
He didn't say.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.273
Not yet.

31:47.275 --> 31:51.440
You know what, the only thing I
owe that guy is a set of cuffs.

31:51.442 --> 31:52.608
All three women had
different attorneys

31:52.610 --> 31:54.112
working their divorce,
however,

31:54.114 --> 31:58.048
one of our clerks, Levi Papani,
assisted on all of the cases.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.045
My assistant's
getting him now.

32:00.047 --> 32:01.642
We appreciate that.

32:01.644 --> 32:03.839
So, Levi, how long's he
been working at your firm?

32:03.841 --> 32:06.510
Little over a year.

32:06.512 --> 32:07.709
Any problems?

32:07.711 --> 32:08.708
He's a good kid.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.880
Graduated top of his class
at Berkeley Law.

32:11.882 --> 32:13.845
We all think he's got
a bright future here.

32:15.111 --> 32:16.508
I was told you wanted
to see me.

32:16.510 --> 32:17.643
Come in, Levi.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.778
This is Lieutenant Kelly
and Captain Grover

32:19.780 --> 32:21.420
of Five-O-- they have
some questions for you.

32:21.422 --> 32:22.716
Actually, uh...

32:22.718 --> 32:24.452
I think there's been a mistake.
Oh, yeah.

32:24.454 --> 32:26.284
The man we're looking for
is a really big guy,

32:26.286 --> 32:27.252
about 300 pounds,

32:27.254 --> 32:29.588
six feet,
long curly hair.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.295
You got anybody else at the
firm who fits that description?

32:33.497 --> 32:35.063
Not that I know of.

32:35.065 --> 32:37.071
Yeah.

32:37.073 --> 32:39.303
Actually...

32:39.305 --> 32:41.503
there is someone.

32:45.377 --> 32:48.613
Taua's my first cousin
on my Makuahine's side.

32:48.615 --> 32:51.645
I got him a job in the mail room
as a favor for my auntie.

32:51.647 --> 32:53.318
I knew this was
a bad idea.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.622
Why's that?

32:54.624 --> 32:56.622
He was always
in trouble as a kid,

32:56.624 --> 32:57.821
getting in fights
at school,

32:57.823 --> 32:58.989
in and out of juvie...

32:58.991 --> 33:00.926
Oh, yeah, I can
see why you'd figure

33:00.928 --> 33:02.326
you'd get him a
job at a law firm.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.030
Good thinking.

33:04.032 --> 33:06.293
Like I said, he's <i> 'ohana.</i>

33:06.295 --> 33:10.037
My auntie swore
he got his act together.

33:10.039 --> 33:12.205
So far there
hasn't been any trouble.

33:14.574 --> 33:16.268
There he is.

33:20.413 --> 33:21.643
Taua Lahani.

33:21.645 --> 33:23.874
Yeah?
Five-O.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.577
Let's talk story.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.881
I stuck my neck
out for you.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.448
Put my reputation
on the line.

33:31.450 --> 33:33.415
And you decided
to repay that favor

33:33.417 --> 33:35.118
by going through
your cousin's case files

33:35.120 --> 33:36.990
and finding out a
few clients who were

33:36.992 --> 33:39.722
living alone,
fresh off a big settlement.

33:39.724 --> 33:42.823
I'm thinking you saw
an opportunity and you took it.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.959
Oh, you thinking
about taking off?

33:46.961 --> 33:49.256
Go ahead, go ahead.

33:49.258 --> 33:51.432
You take one step
toward that door,

33:51.434 --> 33:53.296
I swear I will
throw you a beating

33:53.298 --> 33:55.666
you'll never forget--
big, strong

33:55.668 --> 33:58.233
guy like you preying
on defenseless women.

33:58.235 --> 34:01.306
No, I don't think you got
the stones to run, do you?

34:03.244 --> 34:05.375
I didn't think so.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.911
All right, maybe the hair,
but the rest of it...

34:10.914 --> 34:12.553
Turn around.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.290
Get 'em behind your back.

34:18.563 --> 34:20.058
Jail.

34:27.837 --> 34:30.234
Mm-hmm.

34:31.802 --> 34:33.206
Garig Dobrian?

34:33.208 --> 34:34.639
Yeah, that's me.
Who are you?

34:34.641 --> 34:36.072
Commander McGarrett, Five-O.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.114
Put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.116
You're under arrest.
Turn around. Turn around!

34:40.118 --> 34:41.684
What exactly am I being
charged with, Commander?

34:41.686 --> 34:42.851
On your knees!

34:42.853 --> 34:44.987
Huh?
What are you being charged with?

34:44.989 --> 34:46.850
Yeah.
Take your pick.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.225
Your men executed somebody
this morning,

34:50.226 --> 34:52.561
and then ordered them to murder
the kid who witnessed it.

34:52.563 --> 34:55.266
And in the process, they
killed a police officer.

34:55.268 --> 34:57.235
I'm sorry to hear
about that police officer,

34:57.237 --> 34:58.700
but I had nothing
to do with it.

34:58.702 --> 35:00.353
Now, the murder this morning--
it never happened.

35:00.376 --> 35:01.066
Shut up!

35:01.067 --> 35:02.868
I got a witness who puts
your men at the scene.

35:02.870 --> 35:04.876
No, you don't
understand.

35:04.878 --> 35:06.309
My-my son lied to you.

35:06.311 --> 35:08.510
What'd you say?

35:08.512 --> 35:11.086
My son lied to you.

35:11.088 --> 35:13.255
Eran.

35:13.257 --> 35:15.348
The boy you were trying
to protect at the barbershop--

35:15.350 --> 35:16.684
that's my son.

35:19.252 --> 35:20.289
He's your son?

35:20.291 --> 35:21.784
Why would you want
to kill your own son?

35:21.786 --> 35:23.752
Eran is...
Answer me!

35:23.754 --> 35:26.527
He's a sick boy,
touched by the Devil!

35:30.127 --> 35:31.692
What are you
talking about?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.493
You're a police officer, right?

35:34.495 --> 35:35.829
Must have heard
about those children

35:35.831 --> 35:37.428
who went missing
from my neighborhood.

35:37.430 --> 35:39.836
What's that got
to do with Eran?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.868
Everything.

35:41.870 --> 35:43.836
Eran...

35:43.838 --> 35:46.506
he took them.

35:46.508 --> 35:49.307
Then he murdered them.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.717
Why should I
believe you?

35:55.184 --> 35:59.562
What father would want this
to be true for his own son, huh?

36:02.901 --> 36:04.930
When I... when I found out,

36:04.932 --> 36:07.538
I had to make it right,

36:07.540 --> 36:11.275
but my associates failed
to stop him.

36:11.277 --> 36:13.780
Please tell me you did.

36:19.581 --> 36:22.051
We're almost there, kid.

36:39.211 --> 36:41.208
What are you doing, Eran?

36:42.082 --> 36:44.408
Oh, I think
I'm feeling a lot better.

36:47.282 --> 36:49.952
Now, make a right.

37:04.174 --> 37:05.509
<i>I'm on your side, kid.</i>

37:05.511 --> 37:07.543
I've been on your side
all day long.

37:07.545 --> 37:08.880
Now, we need to get you
to a doctor.

37:08.882 --> 37:10.417
Shut up.
Whatever it is you think you're doing, man,

37:10.419 --> 37:11.817
this is not
gonna help you.

37:11.819 --> 37:13.855
I promise you, this is not gonna
help you at all.

37:13.855 --> 37:14.624
Just get on.

37:14.626 --> 37:15.953
What, you're
stealing a boat now?

37:15.955 --> 37:17.522
It's my father's.
Now get on.

37:17.524 --> 37:18.930
What'd you do, kid?

37:18.932 --> 37:19.962
What did you do?
Eran!

37:19.964 --> 37:21.098
Whatever you did,
can it be that bad?

37:21.100 --> 37:22.530
Do you really think
it's that bad?

37:22.532 --> 37:23.730
Whatever you're running from...
Look you either move now,

37:23.732 --> 37:25.096
or you die here.
I mean, we'll fix it.

37:25.098 --> 37:25.928
We'll tell McGarrett...
I won't ask you again.

37:25.930 --> 37:26.968
I'm not getting
on the boat!

37:26.970 --> 37:28.800
Don't do it, Eran,
don't do it!

37:28.802 --> 37:31.000
Drop your weapon.
That's not gonna happen!

37:31.874 --> 37:33.377
You come any closer,
and I'll shoot him.

37:33.379 --> 37:35.042
You shoot him,
I shoot you.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.243
You don't shoot him,
I still shoot you.

37:37.245 --> 37:38.851
We understand
each other?

37:39.718 --> 37:41.420
Hey!

37:41.422 --> 37:43.020
You get back,
you hear me?!

37:43.022 --> 37:44.923
I said get back!

38:01.868 --> 38:04.098
Hey. Hey.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.130
You all right?

38:05.132 --> 38:06.632
Yeah.

38:10.137 --> 38:12.471
Come on, Odell.

38:16.916 --> 38:19.083
Thanks, man.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.114
You all right?

38:24.988 --> 38:26.986
I don't know.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.722
I thought you
were a pacifist.

38:31.964 --> 38:34.332
Today, I'm making an exception.

38:37.535 --> 38:40.469
What'd he do?

38:49.748 --> 38:51.578
You're a free man, Jer.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.450
Don't mess with me, Chin,
I'm extremely fragile right now.

38:54.452 --> 38:57.049
No, we caught
the guy who did it.

38:57.051 --> 38:58.384
Really?

38:58.386 --> 38:59.520
Really.

38:59.522 --> 39:01.351
Come on, I'll give you
a ride home.

39:02.521 --> 39:04.190
Oh, thank you.

39:04.192 --> 39:06.390
Thank you.

39:06.392 --> 39:08.862
You're the best friend
anyone could ask for.

39:10.095 --> 39:12.229
You're welcome, Jer.

39:13.135 --> 39:14.629
You're welcome.

39:14.631 --> 39:16.629
I can't believe it.

39:16.631 --> 39:18.068
This nightmare's
finally over.

39:19.701 --> 39:23.274
I want my first meal
as a free man to be tacos.

39:25.372 --> 39:28.043
No, pizza.

39:28.045 --> 39:30.348
Pizza tacos.

39:30.350 --> 39:32.581
You've only been here
a couple of hours.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.448
Is that...?

39:39.450 --> 39:41.616
Yep.

39:47.158 --> 39:49.322
I don't see it.

40:22.955 --> 40:24.793
He's dead, right?

40:28.161 --> 40:30.326
I'm sorry.

40:39.038 --> 40:41.202
He was a monster.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.202
He was still my son.

40:53.536 --> 40:55.701
Thank you.

40:57.176 --> 40:59.374
Thank you for doing
what I couldn't.

41:04.939 --> 41:07.837
If you, uh...

41:07.839 --> 41:10.971
if you really want
to thank me,

41:10.973 --> 41:13.947
help me close this case.

41:15.147 --> 41:17.143
Help me get closure

41:17.145 --> 41:19.375
for the families
of Eran's victims.

41:22.352 --> 41:24.013
How?

41:24.015 --> 41:25.717
How can I do that?

41:25.719 --> 41:27.349
I need evidence.

41:27.351 --> 41:30.683
I need you to show me
whatever it was that you found

41:30.685 --> 41:33.048
that told you Eran did
what he did.
