WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:05.273
ANNOUNCER:
Zach Galifianakis is...

00:06.607 --> 00:07.975
Baskets.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.381
(dance music)

00:13.414 --> 00:15.849
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Pose.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.921
("A Love Bizarre" by Sheila E.
and Prince playing)

00:20.954 --> 00:24.225
PRAY TELL:
Dip, spin, work, turn!

00:24.258 --> 00:28.062
Yes, children, feast your eyes
on these fierce

00:28.096 --> 00:31.732
and flexible queens, baby.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.268
-Yeah!
-(all cheering)

00:34.302 --> 00:37.105
This display of talent
is the reason why

00:37.138 --> 00:40.408
the world is trying to be us.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.742
(cheering)

00:41.775 --> 00:44.078
Ah, work it out!

00:44.112 --> 00:48.249
Da-da-da-da-da, ah!
Sha-wham, sha-wham, sha-wham!

00:48.282 --> 00:51.585
Ah! Y'all drinking
for free tonight.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.754
Bartender, put they tab
on Daddy.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.589
All right, look.
Clear the floor.

00:55.623 --> 00:58.426
Clear the floor.
All right, all right.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.094
Now, we all know
this Madonna song

01:00.128 --> 01:01.929
has been bumpin' hard.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.433
Madonna has accomplished
quite the feat,

01:05.466 --> 01:08.769
topping the charts for
two consecutive weeks, right?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.638
-Right.
-(all cheering)

01:10.671 --> 01:13.274
We done changed
the culture, y'all!

01:13.307 --> 01:16.277
(cheers and applause)

01:16.310 --> 01:19.813
Now that everybody in the world

01:19.847 --> 01:22.150
is trying to learn
how to Vogue...

01:22.183 --> 01:24.452
Mm-hmm.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.120
...it's time for us
to switch it up.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.488
Keep 'em guessing.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.290
Put a little twist on Vogue!

01:29.323 --> 01:31.325
-(all cheering)
-All right!

01:31.359 --> 01:35.796
The category is... Lofting.

01:35.829 --> 01:40.801
Yes, divas, I want to see
all my banjee boys

01:40.834 --> 01:46.006
and all my tops serving trade
to hit the floor

01:46.039 --> 01:48.309
and Vogue!

01:48.342 --> 01:50.644
("The Power" by Snap! playing)

01:50.678 --> 01:54.482
Come on, Shadow,
giving us that signature line

01:54.515 --> 01:57.818
that the world knows as Vogue,

01:57.851 --> 02:00.821
but then he drops
right into the banjee boy.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.156
Yeah, you don't know nothin'
about that.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.324
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.825
Who's next? Who's next?

02:04.858 --> 02:09.830
Ah... come on,
Lemar Evangelis...

02:09.863 --> 02:13.667
no, is it... yeah, uh, Wintour!

02:13.701 --> 02:16.003
Lemar Wintour.
You know, she a house hopper.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.671
She a house hopper, baby.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.007
It's all good, though.
You looking real banjee today.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.510
I got one thing to say, though.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.679
That little shimmering earring
will get you clocked.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.349
Darling, you've been warned.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.185
You know I love you, girl.

02:31.219 --> 02:34.021
Oh... Yes!

02:34.054 --> 02:39.860
Gravity Ebony certainly has
his own laws

02:39.893 --> 02:41.362
of motion.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.599
And it's larger than the ocean.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.402
Ah, what?!

02:50.404 --> 02:54.875
Oh, that's for the young,
hung, and full of what?

02:54.908 --> 02:58.379
Ow!

02:58.412 --> 03:00.381
(all cheering)

03:00.414 --> 03:03.384
Oh, oh, the head, bitch.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.885
-He don't even have
the cardboard!
-I need him in my house.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.220
No, are you done?

03:06.254 --> 03:10.258
He don't even need
the cardboard, bitches!

03:10.291 --> 03:12.726
Tens across the board.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.430
Whew! Lord Jesus, y'all done
wore me out on this evening.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.766
Y'all done wore me out.
If there's anybody else

03:18.799 --> 03:20.768
who thinks they can top
what we just seen...

03:20.801 --> 03:23.604
I don't think there is, but
if you're bold enough to try,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.239
come on, the floor is all yours.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.409
Going once, going twice.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.745
Uh-huh, just as I suspected.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.448
There ain't nobody,
so the category is... ugh.

03:37.985 --> 03:42.256
Oh, here we go.
This bitch again.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.259
-(excited whoops, cheers)
-What's happening?

03:45.293 --> 03:46.960
I can't with her.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.116
Okay.
(laughing)

04:09.149 --> 04:10.951
Okay, cut the music.

04:10.984 --> 04:11.985
Please cut the music.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.455
(music stops)

04:14.488 --> 04:16.123
I have to say, bitch,

04:16.156 --> 04:17.458
you do have nerve.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.127
You really do have nerve,
but what are you doing?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.795
I'm paying tribute to Madonna.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.631
The woman that put Vogue
on the map.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.799
Now put that music
back on, bitch.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.968
The category is called Lofting.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.805
It is a dance category
for actual dancers.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.807
We've been down
this road before.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.309
You are not a dancer,

04:35.343 --> 04:37.478
you are not a Voguer,
and quite frankly,

04:37.511 --> 04:39.813
I'm concerned about your health.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.182
Break dancing might burst
that silicone.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.318
And you don't want to go back
to that flat ass

04:44.352 --> 04:45.486
you used to have, now, do you?

04:45.519 --> 04:46.687
Pray, that's fucked up.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.323
Why you always reading me
the riot act, Pray Tell?

04:49.357 --> 04:51.492
You go out of your way
to put me down.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.993
I don't have to put you down

04:53.026 --> 04:54.495
when you're always
in the bottom.

04:54.528 --> 04:58.165
(gasping)

04:58.198 --> 05:02.169
You stood up there on your perch
talking about "It's our time.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.171
"Our time to be seen.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.507
To show the world what we got."

05:06.540 --> 05:08.008
-That's right.
-Yes.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.176
That's right.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.011
But in this room,
you the only one

05:11.044 --> 05:13.714
that refuse to see that
I got something to contribute.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.017
I got heart.
I got talent.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.218
(crowd murmurs support)

05:18.251 --> 05:20.854
I'm a star, just like Madonna.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.557
(light cheering, applause)

05:26.894 --> 05:29.196
Okay.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.366
Judges, your scores.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.036
Five. Five.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.405
Zero.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.740
-WOMAN: Nobody gets a zero.
-Six.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.876
Five. I don't know
what to tell you, girl.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.378
The cards don't lie.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.046
(indistinct chatter)

05:46.079 --> 05:48.716
You gonna regret your words.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.719
I'm a star.
I know who I am.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.886
WOMAN:
Yes, you are.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.055
I am somebody.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.058
-Yes, you are.
-(cheers and applause)

05:58.091 --> 06:03.063
Okay, you go on ahead and be
somebody, Miss Jesse Jackson.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.298
Just not on my floor.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.736
Music, please.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.903
("The Power" resumes)

06:09.937 --> 06:12.239
* I got the power *

06:12.272 --> 06:14.575
Take a hike and don't
ever come back.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.945
* I got the power,
power, power. *

06:17.978 --> 06:19.613
(door opens)

06:19.647 --> 06:22.249
(footfalls approach)

06:22.282 --> 06:25.252
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

06:25.285 --> 06:27.955
Live...

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
Work...

06:30.123 --> 06:33.126
Pose!

06:57.150 --> 06:58.952
-You two are looking fierce.
-All right, Nurse Debbie,

06:58.986 --> 07:00.287
work it out.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.122
Now, you may want
to visit a mirror,

07:02.155 --> 07:04.792
perfect some
of them moves, girl.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.795
Sometimes I feel like God
is playing a joke on us.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.630
We've been trying to break out
into the mainstream for years,

07:09.663 --> 07:11.799
and now she lets it happen
in the middle of a plague.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.167
Yeah, and white folks just want
a smile and a show.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.003
Not all but most.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.639
Well, that's why we got to do
this AIDS Cabaret again.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.976
Give 'em a show
but also spread awareness.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.512
Girl, that bitch was
Voguing at us.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.147
-Been watching too much MTV.
-(laughing)

07:27.180 --> 07:28.315
I can't blame her, though.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.484
-I love that damn song.
-Yes.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.319
Which is why you have to come up
and see what we're doing

07:32.352 --> 07:33.487
at the balls.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.356
The crowds have been
crazy, crazy packed.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.659
Which means everybody is
on their "A" game.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.827
You and Wanda would love it.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.829
I want to,
but, you know, we're asleep

07:41.862 --> 07:43.997
before you kids start putting
on your makeup.

07:44.031 --> 07:44.998
(laughter)

07:45.032 --> 07:46.700
Listen, I only have
a 20-minute lunch break.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.002
-We got to get down to business.
-Oh.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.337
So we're meeting
in this hellhole

07:50.370 --> 07:52.005
because of your schedule, huh?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.340
That's right, honey.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.842
(laughs)
All right.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.878
Well, I've been putting
a lot of thought into it,

07:57.911 --> 08:00.013
and, after Lorna Luft's
surprise appearance

08:00.047 --> 08:01.048
at last year's cabaret,

08:01.081 --> 08:04.051
we can expect
much larger crowds, right?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.520
So I'm thinking maybe we start
with a big group number.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.188
Get the energy going,
and the crowd...

08:08.221 --> 08:11.759
Pray, we're not here to talk
about the AIDS Cabaret.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.362
What?

08:15.395 --> 08:17.565
This isn't another
intervention, is it?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.533
I've been doing real good
with my drinking.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.202
Blanca, may I?

08:22.235 --> 08:24.204
Yeah.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.039
This is Blanca's blood work.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.709
She's been on AZT, as you know,
for a few weeks now,

08:28.742 --> 08:32.379
and already we're starting
to see her T cells climb.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.715
I told you a million times
I'm not taking that toxic shit.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.550
I don't trust it,
I don't like it.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.885
I ain't doing it.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.554
Well, that was then,
this is now.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.889
Blanca told me
about that voodoo shit

08:41.922 --> 08:43.891
you were doing over the weekend.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.560
Oh, did she, now?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.061
You skinny queens
are gonna experience

08:48.095 --> 08:51.231
some fat bitch food tonight.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.066
JARED:
This is disgusting.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.068
The guy at the yoga center said
eating a pound of butter

08:55.102 --> 08:56.904
every day with some mineral oil

08:56.937 --> 08:58.906
can help lower an HIV viral load

08:58.939 --> 09:01.074
by flushing the virus
from the gut.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.910
This guy said a pound.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.079
Bitch, don't act like you didn't
use a pound last night.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.114
Don't act new.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.750
(laughter)

09:09.783 --> 09:11.619
All right.

09:11.652 --> 09:17.090
Bon... apé... tit.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.259
My pilot light was broken,

09:19.292 --> 09:21.595
I needed Blanca's stove,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.430
and it wasn't
none of her business

09:23.463 --> 09:25.933
to be telling you nothing.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.968
If you're willing to eat
a pound of butter a day,

09:28.001 --> 09:30.103
it's obvious
that you're investing

09:30.137 --> 09:31.605
in improving your numbers.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.107
Why won't you go on AZT?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.477
Because I prefer
a more holistic approach.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.280
That shit ain't gonna work.
Your numbers are dropping.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.650
Mine ain't that low.

09:42.683 --> 09:46.119
I really, really don't
appreciate y'all

09:46.153 --> 09:47.621
talking down to me like this.

09:47.655 --> 09:51.792
Can I not just enjoy my life
for one minute?

09:51.825 --> 09:52.826
Just one!

09:54.527 --> 09:57.464
Pray, we want more moments
with you, that's all.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.466
We're doing it
because we love you.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.468
Find another way to love me!

10:01.501 --> 10:03.336
Please find another way.

10:08.676 --> 10:13.814
Now, if you'll excuse me...
I need to go

10:13.847 --> 10:16.817
and resuscitate what's left
of my good mood

10:16.850 --> 10:18.485
that y'all just killed.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.854
I have a life to live.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.373
(knocking on table)

10:40.407 --> 10:42.342
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.511
Now that we have all ordered
our grand slam breakfasts,

10:44.544 --> 10:46.847
it's time for the first
bi-monthly

10:46.880 --> 10:51.018
Masters of Ceremony Council
to officially begin.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.521
Manhattan, as our secretary,
you will read us the agenda.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.691
So please tell us what we all
dragged ourselves out of bed

10:57.725 --> 10:59.359
to talk about this morning.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.861
We need to find a way
to get these bitches

11:00.894 --> 11:02.362
to pay up their dues
and donations.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.731
Those trophies
don't buy themselves.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.198
I know that's right.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.367
And the moments of silence for
individual brothers and sisters

11:07.400 --> 11:08.535
is getting out of hand.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.038
We need to vote
on just one moment

11:11.071 --> 11:12.873
for the ones we've lost
at the beginning of each ball

11:12.906 --> 11:14.074
to save time.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.376
It's come to that?
Jesus.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.747
And on a lighter note,
we need to discuss Madonna.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.748
-Ah...
-The queen.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.751
She's putting so many new eyes
on our scene.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.052
We need to be prepared.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.386
Which is why I've been saying

11:26.419 --> 11:28.221
we need to vote
on a new modern category.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.389
Agreed.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.725
Some of these categories
are from 1973.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.227
Yeah, but we got
to be careful, protective.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.395
Remember who this is for.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.264
-Yeah.
-Us.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.398
Our community.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.432
We are not a tourist attraction.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.901
No, we're not.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.404
Our greatest asset is
our authenticity.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.074
One of the children suggested
we add a lip-synch category.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.410
Ah, ah, ah. I'm shutting
that shit down right now.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.246
If they want to go do that, they
can go on down to the Village

11:53.280 --> 11:55.916
to one of them gay bars
and pretend to be Patti LaBelle

11:55.949 --> 11:57.918
for all them white boys
in their blue jeans.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.287
Yes. Okay, downtown.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.589
-All the way downtown.
-What is real

12:02.622 --> 12:04.624
about flapping your jaw
to a cassette tape?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.794
-Okay?
-That is not how you do a ball.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.262
-Mm-hmm.
-It's how you do ventriloquism.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.597
(laughter)

12:10.630 --> 12:13.133
CANDY:
Bullshit.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.105
PRAY TELL:
Well, well, well, if it ain't
the dummy herself.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.640
Did you follow me here,
Carmen Sandiego?

12:20.673 --> 12:22.642
No. A little birdie told me

12:22.675 --> 12:24.778
that the council
was meeting this morning.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.280
And everybody knows that this is
where you bottoms brunch.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.317
Listen. I heard y'all was gonna
be talking about new categories,

12:30.350 --> 12:32.820
and I just wanted to be here
in the flesh to state my case

12:32.853 --> 12:34.955
before you girls end my dreams.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.489
Candy, please don't
do this to me today.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.992
My patience is as thin
as your wallet.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.293
Candy, what is your problem,
girl?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.294
You snag trophies every time

12:41.328 --> 12:43.163
you walk the face category.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.135
It's not just about winning.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.670
It's about getting seen.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.140
And I clocked Junior Vasquez
at the ball the other night.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.474
Who that?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.643
Girl, is you asleep
at the wheel?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.846
It's only the biggest DJ
in New York.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.314
And you said it yourself,
Pray Tell.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.016
The eyes of the world are on us.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.018
And I need to catch that gaze.
You hear me?

13:05.052 --> 13:06.486
I'm a performer.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.021
A star.
So why don't we just come up

13:08.055 --> 13:10.991
with some categories
so we can show that off?

13:11.024 --> 13:14.661
So, would you like us to put
a pole in the middle of the room

13:14.694 --> 13:17.998
-so you can show us all
your hidden talents?
-Ooh!

13:18.031 --> 13:20.834
Lip-synching is the future.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.837
Girls are making serious coin
in those downtown bars.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.705
Okay, this is not The Gong Show.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.841
This is not Puttin' on the Hits.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.011
You are relentless, Candy,
I'll give you that.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.846
And I admire it, but I suggest

13:32.880 --> 13:35.182
that you take this energy
somewhere else,

13:35.215 --> 13:38.018
because I will never bring
this category up for a vote.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.686
Motion denied.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.521
-Oh...
-Done.
-Yeah.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.390
-(laughter)
-How about that?

13:43.423 --> 13:44.524
Oh!

13:44.557 --> 13:46.359
Why can't you take me seriously,
Pray Tell?

13:46.393 --> 13:49.562
What are you gonna do?
Stab me in broad daylight?!

13:51.064 --> 13:53.066
Do it, bitch.

13:55.102 --> 13:58.371
You ain't seen the last of me.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.240
(knife clatters)

14:01.241 --> 14:03.243
Enjoy your meeting.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.548
(mouths)

14:08.581 --> 14:10.550
(shouting, screaming)

14:10.583 --> 14:11.718
She's...

14:11.751 --> 14:13.553
Motherfucker.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.255
Yeah, I'm done.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.059
I assume she's a Scorpio.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.062
(laughter)

14:22.095 --> 14:27.600
Ah, the category
is Higher than Heaven.

14:27.634 --> 14:32.239
This is an avant-garde
fashion category.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.742
You bitches best not
waste my time now.

14:35.775 --> 14:40.780
Because I'm looking
for innovative experimentation.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.750
Oh, come on, girl.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.753
Oh, give me that little shimmy.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.588
Look at you there,
like you just fell

14:48.621 --> 14:50.590
into a vat of powdered doughnuts
face-first!

14:50.623 --> 14:53.426
I ain't mad at you, bitch!

14:53.460 --> 14:54.761
Judges, your score!

14:54.794 --> 14:57.130
Wow, work it out!

14:57.164 --> 14:58.431
(cheering)

14:58.465 --> 15:00.600
And what have we here?

15:00.633 --> 15:06.106
Swirling around in intergalactic
splendor, bitch.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.976
Like you going to a party
at the Jetsons' house, baby.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.610
Mm-hmm.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.479
Yes. Give me the-- ooh.
Ba-boo, boo, boo.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.114
Give me the scores, y'all.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.949
Uh-huh.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.118
(cheering, applause)

15:18.151 --> 15:19.953
Oh, shit.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.355
All right, Kiki, I see you.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.459
Oh, shit!

15:26.493 --> 15:28.795
I see your new piece of trade
works at the pet store,

15:28.828 --> 15:29.796
don't he?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.966
(laughs)

15:33.000 --> 15:35.668
It's for birds,
real fucking birds, bitch!

15:35.702 --> 15:38.638
Yes. Judges, your score?

15:38.671 --> 15:40.307
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.175
Come on and get--
well, I don't know

15:42.209 --> 15:43.810
that you can pick up
your trophy,

15:43.843 --> 15:45.812
'cause you ain't got
no arms, bitch.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.015
What you gonna do?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.517
-Yo, can we have some birds
at the house?
-No, we not doing all that.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.319
-I want some birds at the house.
-Come with me.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.520
-What?
-It's important.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.657
-* Hold on. *
-It's Candy.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.693
She missed her last two shifts
at the club.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.063
And she hasn't come home yet.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.701
That's not like her,
not to check in with me after.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.337
After what?

16:10.370 --> 16:13.673
Being a mother's
expensive, Blanca.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.177
W-We've been tight
on cash, and...

16:17.210 --> 16:18.845
to make ends meet,

16:18.878 --> 16:20.880
she been taking tricks
down at the motel on Grant.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.850
-You know that's not safe.
-I told her not to, Blanca.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.054
But y'all know Candy.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.189
She gonna do
what she want to do.

16:29.222 --> 16:33.026
Well, did you go to the motel
and see if she was there?

16:33.060 --> 16:34.727
No.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.367
Blanca...

16:40.400 --> 16:42.902
Blanca, I don't want
to go alone.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.739
Come on, let's go.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.879
(door opens)

16:52.912 --> 16:54.914
(music playing over TV)

17:06.426 --> 17:09.229
(screaming over TV)

17:09.262 --> 17:10.730
(bell chimes)

17:10.763 --> 17:14.267
Hi. We're looking
for a girl named Candy.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.403
We get a lot of girls in here.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.271
Here.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.307
This is her picture. Please.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.910
Girl, tell him about the vanity.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.079
She told me on numerous
occasions she always asked

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
for room 44 'cause it has
a vanity in it.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.250
Do you see the sign out front?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.419
We rent rooms by the hour.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.954
People are coming in and out
of here like Grand Central.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.598
Wait, someone's
still in room 44.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.600
Can we knock
and just see if it's her?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.269
-Fuck that, and fuck you.
-LULU (crying): Look,

17:49.302 --> 17:51.604
-just do your fucking job,
please.
-Lulu, stop.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.274
-Okay.
-Listen...

17:54.307 --> 17:56.776
Here's my home phone number.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.278
We'll leave it here
with a picture of Candy.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.648
If you hear anything,
please just...

18:02.849 --> 18:05.185
...just please call me.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.325
Come on, Lulu.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.131
This is all we gonna have
for Friday night dinner?

18:18.165 --> 18:19.499
BLANCA:
Friday night dinner
is canceled this week.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.469
All hands on deck
to look for Candy.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.137
DAMON:
Okay, so I'll search
the west side pier.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.005
-And Pray and I
will go to Harlem.
-Yeah.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.507
Angel, you stake out the club.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.808
Oh, yo,
I'll do that with her, too.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.810
I'm sure you would love to do
that, but you're on phone duty.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.679
Call in every hour
so we can coordinate.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.648
No one sleeps tonight
until we find her.

18:35.682 --> 18:39.152
She might not have been in our
house, but she's our sister.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.020
-(phone ringing)
-LIL PAPI: Please.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.055
Allow me.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.328
Hello?

18:48.361 --> 18:51.531
Ma, it's for you.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.077
Hello?

19:10.717 --> 19:13.220
This is Blanca.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.859
(knocking on door)

19:19.892 --> 19:21.428
(applause over TV)

19:22.895 --> 19:25.898
That's her.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.740
(knocking continues)

19:33.773 --> 19:35.408
(doorbell ringing)

19:40.780 --> 19:43.883
-Hey.
-Hey, girl. Come in. Let's...

19:43.916 --> 19:45.418
-We got to talk.
-What is it?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.254
-Did you find Candy?
-Let's just wait

19:47.287 --> 19:49.889
-until Elektra gets...
-Tell me now, please.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.592
Candy's not coming home.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.062
What do you mean?

19:56.095 --> 19:59.632
Listen, I don't know how to say
this. I just got the call.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.103
Candy's dead.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.907
What?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.310
That's not possible.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.315
I just talked to her
two days ago.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.118
(crying):
No...

20:23.290 --> 20:25.925
She was just making plans
for the future.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.960
-I know.
-(sniffles)

20:32.299 --> 20:35.635
(sobbing)

20:35.668 --> 20:37.670
Blanca.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.141
No.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.623
Thank you, Mother.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.658
(crying softly)

21:01.361 --> 21:05.031
I need you to tell me
what happened, please.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.139
I got a call
from the motel manager.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.141
He said after we left,
he was curious

21:15.174 --> 21:16.976
about what was happening
in those rooms.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.146
So the maid went into the room
to clean it.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.714
-(knocking on door)
-MAID: Housekeeping.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.045
(gasps)

21:58.885 --> 22:02.522
BLANCA:
They found Candy's body
dead in the closet.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.556
(Lulu crying)

22:05.392 --> 22:07.059
Oh, God.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.567
-Do they know
who did it, Blanca?
-No.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.537
But they are looking.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.040
The NYPD doesn't care
about a murdered transsexual.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.210
We've never been treated
with respect or dignity.

22:24.243 --> 22:27.046
Candy's death
isn't any different.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.581
Well, it should be.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.552
Especially to us.

22:32.585 --> 22:36.889
No matter what,
she was our sister.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.058
What is it, May?

22:39.091 --> 22:42.261
And 11 girls have been killed
this year.

22:48.768 --> 22:52.238
We just keep sitting around
here, looking all sad.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.574
We're letting it happen.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.743
Candy would've wanted us
to fight.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.579
Okay? She would've wanted us
to stand up

22:59.612 --> 23:01.581
and say this is fucked up.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.250
She would have wanted us
to honor her memory.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.085
ANGEL:
So, then what do we do, Elektra?

23:06.118 --> 23:09.121
We plan a celebration
of her life.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.291
But we got to get her body
from the morgue.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.795
And I just don't know
how to do that.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.097
None of us are
her blood relatives.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.799
You and I will handle that.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.935
Angel, you get ahold
of Candy's parents.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.805
Let them know what happened.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.975
We're going to make it
through this.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.110
I promise you.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.145
NURSE JUDY:
I work on the eighth floor.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.947
You used to date
my coworker Jeff.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.649
You broke his heart, actually.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.451
He wouldn't stop
talking about you.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.987
Is that what he said?

23:41.020 --> 23:43.490
Yes, but that's really not
what this is about.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.827
Listen, I'm gay, you're gay.

23:47.860 --> 23:51.330
We're all dancing
under the same fucking rainbow.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.332
-We need your help.
-I'm sorry for your loss,

23:53.365 --> 23:56.335
but you're asking me
to break the law.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.641
(sighs) Okay, l-let me put it
to you in a different way.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.644
Let's say things had worked out
between you and Jeff,

24:04.677 --> 24:05.978
and you'd gotten married.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.848
And after 30 years of bliss,
he dies on you.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.485
According to the law, you'd have
no right to claim his body.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.153
Or his crazy family
could have blocked you

24:14.186 --> 24:16.989
from entering his hospital room
in his final days.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.358
That would be fucked up,
wouldn't it?

24:19.391 --> 24:21.494
Yes, it would.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.830
Well, we have
the same situation here.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.833
Blanca and Elektra
are Candy's family,

24:26.866 --> 24:29.702
and I need you
to release her body to them

24:29.736 --> 24:32.038
so we can give this girl
a proper funeral.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.707
I'll take the fall
for whatever happens.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.877
Just, please give us a break.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.716
(paper rustling)

24:46.385 --> 24:48.187
Write down the address

24:48.220 --> 24:50.189
of the funeral parlor
you'd like to use.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.224
I'll send her there.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.202
Where's Lulu?

25:03.235 --> 25:05.404
She can't take it.
She can't see her this way.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.707
You think she blames herself
for getting Candy that job?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.041
I don't know.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.577
I never understood that one.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.245
She always walked
in Candy's shadow.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.389
I embalmed her myself.
No charge. She had been here

25:23.422 --> 25:25.558
almost every week
these past few months

25:25.592 --> 25:28.595
paying respects
to so many friends.

25:28.628 --> 25:32.398
She would always take the time
to greet me by my name.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.433
I appreciated that.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.612
I'll give you some time.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.751
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.253
That makeup is tore up
from the floor up.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.088
What the hell
is with that church lady wig?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.256
Even I wouldn't wear that.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.457
We can't let her go
in the ground

25:58.490 --> 26:00.760
looking like my Aunt Carol.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.428
She will come back and haunt us
to the end of our days.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.463
We have to do something
about this.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.102
Ladies, empty your purses.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.471
We have two hours.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.952
They couldn't even
acknowledge her

26:25.985 --> 26:27.119
as their daughter.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.288
-I feel like I failed her.
-No.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.958
Don't you go blaming yourself
for their faults.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.994
I had one final obligation
for Candy,

26:35.027 --> 26:36.629
and I couldn't even do that.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.297
Shit.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.299
Lulu ain't even show up.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.468
Grieving is tricky, baby.

26:42.501 --> 26:45.471
We all deal
with loss differently.

26:45.504 --> 26:48.174
She'll find her way.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.144
You must be kind
to yourself today.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.647
Besides, look how many people

26:54.681 --> 26:56.482
-showed up for Candy.
-Right.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.651
This is her family.
We were real to her.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.052
Trust.

27:01.187 --> 27:04.190
Now I'm-a go get
this thing started.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.326
Hey, y'all.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.527
Hey.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.163
How's she doing?

27:11.197 --> 27:13.332
As best she can.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.167
How you holding up, hon?

27:15.201 --> 27:16.368
I'm all right.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.207
Okay.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.509
I think it's time.

28:05.251 --> 28:09.255
So, I'm not gonna stand up here
and lie to y'all today.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.759
Miss Candy...

28:15.261 --> 28:18.397
She was a pain
in my goddamn black ass.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.599
(laughter)

28:20.632 --> 28:22.601
Y'all know
what I'm talking about.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.770
(sniffles)

28:23.803 --> 28:25.404
We didn't always see eye to eye,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.940
but she was still my sister.

28:27.974 --> 28:31.610
Like you all are my sisters

28:31.643 --> 28:34.914
and my siblings and my children.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.783
My cousins.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.619
Y'all know family
don't always get along.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.454
-(indistinct chatter)
-(Pray Tell laughs)

28:44.490 --> 28:46.492
It's all right.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.431
You know, I was...

28:52.464 --> 28:56.435
I was sitting
in this very room, what?

28:56.468 --> 28:58.437
Maybe a couple months ago...

28:58.470 --> 29:00.272
(sniffles)

29:00.306 --> 29:03.776
...at another memorial

29:03.810 --> 29:08.280
saying farewell
to yet another friend.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.282
And I overheard Miss Candy say

29:10.316 --> 29:13.485
that funerals were a waste.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.654
She said they were a waste
because...

29:15.687 --> 29:18.124
"only the living get
to partake."

29:18.157 --> 29:20.292
(laughter)

29:20.326 --> 29:23.462
The departed are just
propped up for viewing.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.797
-Mm-hmm.
-You know that's right.

29:24.831 --> 29:28.801
Unable to see who showed up.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.003
Unable to hear who cried out.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.639
Unable to respond,

29:33.672 --> 29:37.676
to speak their final truths.

29:43.049 --> 29:47.686
We all have so much...

29:49.055 --> 29:50.656
...that we want to say to her

29:50.689 --> 29:54.693
that will have
to remain unspoken.

29:56.362 --> 30:00.699
We will never again get
the opportunity to...

30:00.732 --> 30:03.836
tell her what she meant to us,

30:03.870 --> 30:07.506
to thank her
for what she gave us,

30:07.539 --> 30:09.842
and to give her the grandest,

30:09.876 --> 30:11.844
shiniest motherfucking trophy

30:11.878 --> 30:15.347
for her contribution
to our community!

30:15.381 --> 30:16.883
-(overlapping chatter)
-Yes, sir.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.251
(mouthing)

30:25.224 --> 30:29.528
But unfinished business is
the burden of the living.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.231
We are charged

30:32.264 --> 30:33.699
to continue on,

30:33.732 --> 30:35.401
living through this tragedy

30:35.434 --> 30:38.037
so that we can fight our hardest

30:38.070 --> 30:40.706
to protect our sisters
from the hands

30:40.739 --> 30:43.209
of men who are weak!

30:43.242 --> 30:45.878
Who are afraid

30:45.912 --> 30:48.580
to deal with their desires.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.552
Today we mourn.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.889
But tomorrow
we stand firmly together,

30:56.923 --> 30:58.757
never losing sight

30:58.790 --> 31:00.426
of who we truly are.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.394
-(overlapping chatter)
-Yes, sir.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.430
Goddamn right.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.402
Now...

31:10.436 --> 31:14.406
let us take a moment of silence

31:14.440 --> 31:18.077
for our dearly departed,

31:18.110 --> 31:22.448
taken too soon sister...

31:24.450 --> 31:27.119
...Miss Candy Ferocity.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.157
CANDY:
I forgive you.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.495
That's right, bitch.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.332
I said I forgive you.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.140
You need to know

32:21.173 --> 32:24.643
I was a forgiving woman.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.312
How the fuck else
you think I dealt

32:26.345 --> 32:28.480
with all the backstabbers
in this world?

32:28.514 --> 32:30.182
A woman's got to forgive.

32:30.216 --> 32:34.020
Otherwise,
her complexion gets all hazy.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.356
Least I died beautiful.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.659
Not that you ever noticed.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.828
I collected the finest trade

32:42.861 --> 32:47.033
that Manhattan, Brooklyn,
and the Bronx had to offer.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.035
But you?

32:49.068 --> 32:51.670
I never once impressed you.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.339
Why?

32:53.372 --> 32:55.841
Why were you such an asshole
to me?

32:55.874 --> 32:58.010
You gave plenty
of other people breaks

32:58.044 --> 33:00.046
when they didn't deserve it.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.517
Maybe...

33:05.551 --> 33:08.054
Maybe I didn't want
to look at you.

33:08.087 --> 33:11.723
You are unapologetic,

33:11.757 --> 33:15.061
loud, black, femme.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.729
(voice breaking): All the things
I try to hide about myself

33:17.763 --> 33:20.199
when I go out
into the real world.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.868
You are all of them.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.736
I guess...

33:26.738 --> 33:29.375
...in a way, I was just trying
to protect you.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.911
What good is everyone's opinions
when you're gone?

33:34.746 --> 33:37.216
I'm a free bird now.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.218
No regrets.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.253
That.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.722
I was jealous of that bravery.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.558
I never had a choice
to hide who I was.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.728
My loudness walked into the room
before I did.

33:49.761 --> 33:53.132
-(chuckles)
-Not a damn thing I could do
about that.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.571
Maybe you're just doing what
you got to do to stay alive.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.074
Maybe.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.576
I'll tell you what.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.579
It's gonna be a sad, lonely life

34:07.613 --> 34:10.582
at those balls without me.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.252
You know I would have killed
that lip-synch category,

34:13.285 --> 34:15.287
-you bitch.
-(laughs) Yeah.

34:15.321 --> 34:18.157
Yes, you would, girl.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.593
BLANCA:
Pray.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.295
Pray.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.796
Get on with it.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.301
(Pray Tell sniffles)

34:34.840 --> 34:36.775
(exhales) Okay.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.610
Thank you.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.280
Thank you. So, y'all know

34:41.313 --> 34:43.115
that Candy wouldn't want us
to drag this shit out,

34:43.149 --> 34:45.617
so let's keep it moving.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.786
I understand

34:47.819 --> 34:50.989
that people have different ways
of mourning and grieving,

34:51.022 --> 34:53.159
so if you have something

34:53.192 --> 34:55.961
that you want to share or say,

34:55.994 --> 35:00.166
please come up here
and express yourselves.

35:00.199 --> 35:03.669
We are all here
to love and support each other.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.512
(Angel crying)

35:15.847 --> 35:18.684
I don't even know what to say.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.155
(sniffles)

35:23.189 --> 35:25.991
This could've been me in there.

35:26.024 --> 35:28.227
(sobbing)

35:29.361 --> 35:31.863
Why you?

35:34.366 --> 35:37.035
Wh-Why not me?

35:43.041 --> 35:46.512
CANDY:
This needs to be
a reminder to you

35:46.545 --> 35:49.080
to reach for something more
than a quick coin.

35:50.216 --> 35:52.050
But I'm not doing that no more.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.686
But I can see you holding
those piers in your back pocket

35:54.720 --> 35:57.223
in case this modeling thing
falls through.

35:57.256 --> 36:01.193
-But we not allowed
in that world.
-Stop doubting yourself.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.862
You right. You the first,

36:03.895 --> 36:05.531
the best of us.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.367
Who better than you, bitch?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.737
You gon' crack that door
wide open for girls like us.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.906
That is your duty.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.709
I better not see you back
at those tollbooths, neither.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.545
-No.
-Unless you want me

36:19.578 --> 36:21.580
-haunting you
from the depths of hell.
-No.

36:21.613 --> 36:25.417
-I'm gonna miss you, Candy.
-(clicks tongue)

36:25.451 --> 36:27.386
(Angel sniffles)

36:27.419 --> 36:29.421
Don't waste your time
missing me.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.423
(Angel cries)

36:31.457 --> 36:34.393
Spend that energy
on a Candy girl out there.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.429
Beautify her
in my stunning image.

36:38.764 --> 36:42.568
Oh, and thanks
for trying with my parents.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.603
You did right by me, sis.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.611
(crying softly)

36:57.115 --> 36:59.285
LULU (voice breaking):
Angel?

37:01.987 --> 37:03.622
ANGEL:
Lulu?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.627
I didn't think you were coming.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.430
(crying):
I'm not staying.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.599
I can't see her like that.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.634
Laid in some box
with a bad beat.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.803
It's not how
I want to remember her.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.143
Lulu.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.649
You choose
how you want to remember her.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.118
This is just the moment.

37:33.151 --> 37:36.655
Y'all have had thousands
of memories together.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.624
(crying):
Yeah.

37:38.657 --> 37:42.328
And it's the bad ones
that always play in my head.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.669
(Angel sighs)

37:53.171 --> 37:55.707
But... but don't you want
to say goodbye?

37:57.175 --> 37:59.345
(crying):
I'm so scared.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.481
Me, too.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.816
But, Lulu, the regret

38:04.850 --> 38:08.320
that's gonna come over you
tomorrow is gonna be unbearable.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.356
Trust me.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.225
(crying)

38:19.030 --> 38:20.999
NURSE JUDY:
Seat taken?

38:21.032 --> 38:23.835
Go ahead.

38:23.869 --> 38:27.172
Any more luck getting through
that thick skull of Pray Tell's?

38:27.205 --> 38:30.008
He won't budge,
and I'm getting worried.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.343
He'll never admit to this,

38:31.377 --> 38:33.011
but I can tell
he's lost a little weight,

38:33.044 --> 38:34.513
and he's been drinking coffee
day and night

38:34.546 --> 38:36.014
just to get his energy up.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.183
I don't know what to do.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.352
Well, you can't do anything.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.187
It's up to him.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.689
Excuse me. Will you two magpies

38:43.722 --> 38:45.357
take your chitchat
somewhere else?

38:45.391 --> 38:47.693
Some of us are trying
to be respectful.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.061
Oh. Excuse me.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.530
(laughs)
Don't even worry about her.

38:51.563 --> 38:53.098
That's how she is.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.778
(Lulu gasps softly)

39:10.749 --> 39:12.751
(Angel whispers)

39:24.095 --> 39:27.733
LULU (crying):
Girl, I can't believe
you're gone.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.402
Now I have to run this house
by myself.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.772
You know I can't rely
on these girls for nothing.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.074
I'm gonna miss your crazy ass.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.609
You were a...

39:37.643 --> 39:40.946
You were a thieving bitch!

39:40.979 --> 39:42.581
That's my brooch!

39:42.614 --> 39:44.583
You convinced me
Florida probably stole it.

39:44.616 --> 39:48.454
You stole my style, my ideas,
and my gloves!

39:48.487 --> 39:50.422
-(crowd gasping)
-Is she taking her gloves?!

39:50.456 --> 39:51.423
(crowd clamoring)

39:51.457 --> 39:53.459
That's my motherfucking hat!

39:54.460 --> 39:57.095
Lulu, stop, stop, stop, stop...

39:57.128 --> 39:58.964
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

39:58.997 --> 40:01.767
Get the fuck off of me!

40:01.800 --> 40:03.435
(Lulu cries)

40:03.469 --> 40:04.936
Get the fuck out of my way.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.972
-Oh.
-Uh-uh.

40:10.509 --> 40:14.145
I'm not coming
to no family reunions.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.993
(sniffles)

40:37.836 --> 40:39.304
CANDY:
They gonna be talking

40:39.337 --> 40:42.641
about this funeral
for years now.

40:42.674 --> 40:46.645
You know half the shit you took
off me wasn't even yours.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.147
It seemed like a waste
to bury it with you.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.316
True.

40:51.349 --> 40:55.320
I was dying of boredom from all
those crocodile tears over me.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.188
None of those people could stand

40:57.222 --> 41:00.492
to give me one kind word
when I was alive.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.528
At least you was honest.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.536
I know why
it was hard for you in there.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.672
You never liked me neither.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.207
And why should I?

41:17.208 --> 41:18.677
(Lulu scoffs)

41:18.710 --> 41:20.679
Yeah, we could do some damage

41:20.712 --> 41:23.014
when we set our eyes on someone.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.050
We could talk some shit.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.885
But you and me--

41:26.918 --> 41:29.855
we wasn't no Laverne
and motherfucking Shirley.

41:29.888 --> 41:32.023
When did you ever
show me kindness?

41:32.057 --> 41:34.693
I was your accessory,
and you resented me

41:34.726 --> 41:37.195
because I was light-skinned
and thick.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.264
And I played my strengths
at the balls.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.036
It wasn't that bad.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.038
Yes, it was.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.406
Come on.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.041
Remember that time

41:50.075 --> 41:54.045
we stole that giant down coat
from Bloomingdale's?

41:54.079 --> 41:56.047
And went to the A&P
and walked out

41:56.081 --> 41:58.416
with an entire
Thanksgiving dinner underneath?

42:00.251 --> 42:03.388
Or that time we snagged, like,
six trophies in one night.

42:03.421 --> 42:05.557
That has got to be a record
or something.

42:05.591 --> 42:06.758
Yeah.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.060
Or when it was 20 below,

42:09.094 --> 42:12.430
and we didn't have no heat,
and we had to snuggle together

42:12.463 --> 42:15.601
under that giant
Bloomingdale's coat all night.

42:17.302 --> 42:20.772
Okay, fine.
Maybe we had some good times.

42:20.806 --> 42:23.408
We weren't all bad.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.443
We weren't all good, either.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.616
But some years gone,

42:30.649 --> 42:33.451
something crazy or terrible

42:33.484 --> 42:35.754
or hilarious is gonna happen,

42:35.787 --> 42:38.924
and you're gonna look
at that space next to you

42:38.957 --> 42:41.092
where I should be,

42:41.126 --> 42:44.963
and I'm not gonna be there
to talk about it.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.132
And you're gonna miss me, girl.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.138
Time's gonna heal us

42:53.171 --> 42:56.141
in a way it never could
if I was still alive.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.648
You making me cry
and messing my makeup.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.539
(crying)

43:42.688 --> 43:44.856
(Blanca humming)

43:48.526 --> 43:50.528
(both humming)

44:09.580 --> 44:11.582
(Blanca humming)

44:14.385 --> 44:16.221
(Elektra clears throat)

44:16.254 --> 44:19.057
There's an old couple out there
looking like George and Weezy,

44:19.090 --> 44:20.726
partaking in our refreshments.

44:20.759 --> 44:22.193
What do you want me
to do about it?

44:22.227 --> 44:25.263
Get out there
and shoo them away.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.547
Hello.

44:42.580 --> 44:43.882
Hello, I'm Blanca.

44:43.915 --> 44:46.718
I'm Darnell Johnson.

44:46.752 --> 44:48.053
This is my wife Vivica.

44:48.086 --> 44:49.721
How did you know Candy?

44:49.755 --> 44:51.089
Candy?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.759
What kind of damn name is Candy?

44:55.593 --> 44:57.395
It's the one she chose.

44:57.428 --> 45:01.933
Candy was... our child.

45:03.802 --> 45:07.438
He... was our son.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.242
I'm so sorry.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.912
She was a good person.

45:13.945 --> 45:16.114
And Candy was loved.

45:17.983 --> 45:19.918
You know, if it's
any consolation,

45:19.951 --> 45:21.619
everyone showed up for her.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.624
She was one of a kind.

45:29.294 --> 45:32.297
Why don't y'all come on in back
and say goodbye.

45:46.011 --> 45:47.445
I'll be right over there.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.848
Just let me know
if you need anything.

45:54.152 --> 45:56.988
Darnell, I don't know
if I can do this.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.659
It's already okay.

46:15.841 --> 46:18.810
Oh, my God.

46:18.844 --> 46:21.346
Candy's parents came.

46:32.690 --> 46:34.893
I can't believe you showed up.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.701
Baby.

46:47.705 --> 46:51.843
Why did it take me so long
to see you?

46:51.877 --> 46:53.344
You refused to.

46:53.378 --> 46:57.215
Ma, how many times you catch me
wearing your Revlon Charlie?

46:57.248 --> 46:58.850
Or trying on your wigs?

46:58.884 --> 47:01.352
Why didn't you ever scold me,

47:01.386 --> 47:03.889
smack my behind,
shoo me away, something?

47:06.057 --> 47:08.193
I thought you welcomed it.

47:08.226 --> 47:10.595
Like me and you had
some sort of pact.

47:15.233 --> 47:18.069
(voice cracking): You were
my gateway to the feminine.

47:19.770 --> 47:23.208
But when you rejected me,
I tried to tell you...

47:23.241 --> 47:25.743
I didn't know.

47:25.776 --> 47:29.714
I just thought
maybe you was creative.

47:29.747 --> 47:31.883
At worst, gay.

47:31.917 --> 47:34.886
But becoming a woman,

47:34.920 --> 47:37.555
how was I supposed to respond?

47:37.588 --> 47:40.725
Wasn't no guidebook
instructing me

47:40.758 --> 47:43.428
on how to raise a child
like you.

47:48.133 --> 47:50.401
This is me, Ma.

47:50.435 --> 47:54.272
This is who I truly am.

48:04.115 --> 48:06.151
I see that.

48:12.457 --> 48:14.792
You know...

48:14.825 --> 48:18.930
the outside is different,

48:18.964 --> 48:21.632
but beneath it,

48:21.666 --> 48:25.470
all I see is my baby.

48:29.807 --> 48:33.111
(crying):
I've missed you.

48:33.144 --> 48:36.614
I missed you, too, Ma.

48:36.647 --> 48:39.617
(sniffles)

48:39.650 --> 48:41.486
(shudders)

48:42.487 --> 48:44.322
CANDY:
Daddy?

48:50.695 --> 48:54.332
You always did have
a sweet spot for me,

48:54.365 --> 48:56.801
in spite of my frilly ways.

48:56.834 --> 49:00.171
You never knew
how to throw a spiral, but...

49:00.205 --> 49:03.341
your tough behind
sure could tackle.

49:03.374 --> 49:05.010
My little fighter.

49:08.013 --> 49:10.015
All them...

49:10.048 --> 49:13.818
boy things just wasn't your way.

49:13.851 --> 49:16.154
But you had guts.

49:16.187 --> 49:18.156
I got that from you.

49:18.189 --> 49:19.357
(chuckles softly)

49:19.390 --> 49:21.359
Remember that dollhouse?

49:21.392 --> 49:22.994
(chuckles)

49:23.028 --> 49:25.496
How could anyone ever forget?

49:25.530 --> 49:28.033
You asked for it
for two birthdays,

49:28.066 --> 49:30.335
a Christmas, and a Kwanzaa.

49:30.368 --> 49:32.370
I knew you were the one
who got it for me.

49:33.871 --> 49:36.841
(chuckles):
I saw you,

49:36.874 --> 49:39.377
sneaking in at bedtime.

49:39.410 --> 49:42.680
I pretended to be asleep,
but I watched you

49:42.713 --> 49:45.350
setting it up.

49:45.383 --> 49:47.352
It was the best Christmas.

49:47.385 --> 49:49.420
Ever.

49:50.721 --> 49:53.391
I wanted my baby
to have what he...

49:56.061 --> 49:59.197
I guess...

49:59.230 --> 50:02.067
what she wanted.

50:03.568 --> 50:06.204
I know you didn't
fully understand who I was

50:06.237 --> 50:07.372
or what I went through.

50:07.405 --> 50:09.407
But, that night,

50:09.440 --> 50:11.409
I felt seen by you.

50:13.078 --> 50:16.047
(voice breaking):
And having my daddy...

50:16.081 --> 50:18.716
see me...

50:18.749 --> 50:20.551
(sniffles)

50:20.585 --> 50:25.623
...it gave me all the courage
I needed to become who I am.

50:26.757 --> 50:29.394
I can't let you go.

50:29.427 --> 50:31.729
We're just getting started.

50:31.762 --> 50:34.399
You have to.

50:34.432 --> 50:37.102
It's okay.

50:39.637 --> 50:42.607
I love you, Daddy.

51:05.630 --> 51:08.766
We want to thank Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson for coming out today.

51:08.799 --> 51:10.435
Thank you so much.

51:10.468 --> 51:13.604
So, if the MCs could come
and join me for a minute.

51:13.638 --> 51:17.475
We have a very special
announcement to make.

51:20.978 --> 51:23.614
So, we were gonna wait until
this weekend's ball to do this,

51:23.648 --> 51:27.452
but I think now is
a, a more appropriate time.

51:27.485 --> 51:33.124
In honor of Candy,
the MC Council has decided

51:33.158 --> 51:36.461
that from here on,
we will be offering

51:36.494 --> 51:40.331
a lip-synching category
at each and every ball.

51:40.365 --> 51:42.500
We're gonna call the category...

51:45.503 --> 51:48.306
...Candy's Sweet Refrain.

51:48.339 --> 51:50.841
I think she'd like that.

52:01.219 --> 52:04.054
To Candy.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.030
-To Candy.
-To Candy.
-To Candy.

52:14.031 --> 52:15.065
To Candy.

52:24.875 --> 52:27.345
(exhales) So,
if the pallbearers could come,

52:27.378 --> 52:30.047
it's time.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.769
(cheering and applause)

53:04.782 --> 53:06.751
(enthusiastic cheering)

53:06.784 --> 53:10.087
("Never Knew Love Like This
Before" playing)

53:20.631 --> 53:25.903
* I never knew love
like this before *

53:25.936 --> 53:30.408
* Now I'm lonely nevermore *

53:30.441 --> 53:34.779
* Since you came into my life *

53:38.949 --> 53:42.920
* You are my love-light,
this I know *

53:42.953 --> 53:47.425
* And I'll never let you go *

53:47.458 --> 53:51.629
* You're my all,
you're part of me *

53:55.800 --> 53:59.804
* Once I was lost
and now I'm found *

53:59.837 --> 54:04.609
* Then you turned
my world around *

54:04.642 --> 54:09.113
* When I need you,
I call your name *

54:09.146 --> 54:10.615
(all cheering)

54:10.648 --> 54:13.284
* 'Cause I never *

54:13.318 --> 54:16.821
* Knew love like this before *

54:18.356 --> 54:19.624
* Opened my eyes *

54:19.657 --> 54:21.792
* 'Cause I never *

54:21.826 --> 54:26.297
* Knew love like this before *

54:26.331 --> 54:28.132
* What a surprise *

54:28.165 --> 54:30.301
* 'Cause I never *

54:30.335 --> 54:35.172
* Knew love like this before *

54:38.042 --> 54:42.313
* This feeling's so deep
inside of me *

54:42.347 --> 54:46.984
* Such a tender fantasy *

54:47.017 --> 54:51.021
* You're the one
I'm living for *

54:55.360 --> 55:00.498
* You are my sunlight
and my rain *

55:00.531 --> 55:02.700
* And time could never change *

55:02.733 --> 55:04.201

56:45.803 --> 56:46.971
Hey.

56:47.004 --> 56:50.775
I bet you Candy's
smiling in heaven right now.

56:50.808 --> 56:54.111
She finally got
what she always wanted.

56:54.144 --> 56:56.947
For you Chatty Cathys
to shut the fuck up.

56:56.981 --> 56:59.817
(laughter)

57:02.987 --> 57:04.955
Pray, give us a toast to Candy.

57:04.989 --> 57:07.658
Yeah.
(clears throat)

57:08.993 --> 57:12.129
(exhales sharply)
To Candy.

57:12.162 --> 57:14.632
She was a funny bitch,

57:14.665 --> 57:17.635
and we will all miss her.

57:17.668 --> 57:20.838
-To Candy.
-ALL: To Candy.

57:30.347 --> 57:32.149
On a lighter note,

57:32.182 --> 57:34.318
what the hell is going on
with Lemar's wig?

57:34.351 --> 57:36.521
(laughter)

57:36.554 --> 57:38.155
I was waiting for somebody
to say something.

57:38.188 --> 57:39.824
Yo, he drowning in them waves.

57:39.857 --> 57:42.326
LEMAR:
Nobody's drowning.
This is not a wig.

57:42.359 --> 57:45.362
This is an inspired
Josephine Baker look.

57:45.395 --> 57:46.997
BLANCA:
Let them know, let them know.

57:47.031 --> 57:48.666
LEMAR:
Okay.

57:48.699 --> 57:51.836
Next time, you need
to make them kids stick around

57:51.869 --> 57:54.204
and help you clean up
before they go out to the club.

57:54.238 --> 57:55.840
Nah, they need to go out
and be young.

57:55.873 --> 57:58.008
-It's been a very rough week.
-Who you telling?

57:58.042 --> 58:01.211
I need to go out
and shake my ass, too.

58:01.245 --> 58:04.181
Oh. Are you sure them
old-ass knees gonna let you?

58:04.214 --> 58:05.182
I'm being serious.

58:05.215 --> 58:06.183
I know.

58:06.216 --> 58:08.185
(chuckles)

58:08.218 --> 58:11.556
I've been holding on to a lot
of stress for way too long.

58:11.589 --> 58:14.358
Listen, I like an empty house,
nice and peaceful.

58:14.391 --> 58:16.026
Just me and my thoughts.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.361
They don't scare you?

58:17.394 --> 58:19.363
Sometimes.

58:19.396 --> 58:22.366
But I got my friends
to lift me up.

58:22.399 --> 58:25.069
And I will be here
to do the same.

58:30.908 --> 58:33.243
That cup is clean.

58:33.277 --> 58:35.245
Just fill it up.

58:35.279 --> 58:37.414
I'm thirsty.

58:44.922 --> 58:47.925
Now, where in the hell
did you get those?

58:50.460 --> 58:53.898
After the funeral
I went to see Judy.

58:53.931 --> 58:56.934
I figured it's time
I started taking these.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.409
What made you change your mind?

59:05.442 --> 59:08.946
I was looking at the children.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.748
Full of dreams,

59:10.781 --> 59:12.750
thinking they have
all the time in the world.

59:12.783 --> 59:17.287
And I'm standing over here
trying to stay alive.

59:18.956 --> 59:21.458
I don't want to go
to my casket...

59:21.491 --> 59:22.927
with any regrets.

59:22.960 --> 59:26.130
Nothing left undone...

59:26.163 --> 59:28.332
or unsaid.

59:30.334 --> 59:32.803
(crying):
Candy's--

59:32.837 --> 59:36.440
Candy's death reminded me

59:36.473 --> 59:38.976
that life is so precious.

59:40.645 --> 59:43.814
And I don't want to waste mine.
I don't want to waste it.

59:46.984 --> 59:49.654
(exhales)
And...

59:51.021 --> 59:54.324
I have an obligation
to fight for my life

59:54.358 --> 59:56.460
just as much as I've been
fighting for Act Up.

59:56.493 --> 59:58.495
(both laugh)

1:00:01.999 --> 1:00:04.001
Pray, I'm so proud of you.

1:00:05.535 --> 1:00:08.338
(sighs)

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:18.482
Oh, it's a party now?

1:00:18.515 --> 1:00:20.651
No, more like a toast.

1:00:20.685 --> 1:00:23.220
(laughing)

1:00:32.196 --> 1:00:34.198
To life.
