00:01.768 --> 00:03.102
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:03.104 --> 00:04.103
What's gonna happen
when he finds out

00:04.105 --> 00:05.104
I've been lying to him

00:05.106 --> 00:06.538
For the past ten years?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.173
That can't happen.
He can't ever know the truth.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.009
Get back together
with him.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.310
Where was this photo taken?

00:11.312 --> 00:12.978
Someplace in iraq.
I was never there.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.980
This guy knows what happened
to us over there!

00:14.982 --> 00:16.615
He was in charge!
Move!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.050
Get in here!

00:20.620 --> 00:22.054
(horn blaring)

00:22.056 --> 00:24.990
There's nothing on record
from 2003 to 2005.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.693
It's like two years
of their lives were erased.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.961
How do you know me?

00:28.963 --> 00:29.962
Met you in iraq.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.296
And what was my name?

00:31.298 --> 00:32.664
What was I doing there?
I don't know, buddy.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.966
What was operation raining fire?

00:33.968 --> 00:35.300
Dobson:
<i>It was a mess is what it was.</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:37.236
I saw people burned to the bone

00:37.238 --> 00:38.570
Where they stood.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.972
It was the apocalypse.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.807
Your agent is
in some serious trouble.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.509
Don't get too comfortable here.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.177
I figure you got two hours

00:45.179 --> 00:48.380
Before they get here
and smoke your ass.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.816
(yells)

00:51.918 --> 00:54.053
I can get to verax's
personnel records,

00:54.055 --> 00:55.854
Find out who you are.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.489
You go on record
to the u.S. Attorney

00:57.491 --> 00:59.992
About verax's activities,
I'll get you out of here.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.829
Man (over radio): Sniper!
Get down!

01:03.831 --> 01:05.497
(over radio):
Shots fired! Shots fired!

01:08.868 --> 01:11.070
(engine humming)

01:34.027 --> 01:37.129
Badass!

01:44.437 --> 01:45.871
That's so cool.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.607
These things are gonna be
delivering pizza soon.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.310
They're gonna be
delivering many things.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.451
Mind if I give it a try?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.320
It's difficult
to control, actually.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.455
But you can help me
launch it again.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.790
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.958
Go pick it up.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.060
This is great!

02:08.928 --> 02:10.896
Carefully.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.499
What's this thing on the bottom?

02:13.501 --> 02:15.300
Extra battery.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.137
Hey, take it over there.
Set it down in front of you.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.599
(yells)

03:33.713 --> 03:35.380
Maggie:
<i>I know who</i>

03:35.382 --> 03:37.316
Deputy director spiller is,
but who are the other two?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.884
That's dan cabbot

03:38.886 --> 03:40.152
From the u.S. Attorney's office.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.486
And jessica simon
from internal affairs.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.521
How much trouble

03:42.523 --> 03:43.488
Do you think martin's in?

03:43.490 --> 03:46.258
Not a little.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.362
The hellfire missile you
reported seeing-- where is it?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.531
Unknown. During
the apprehension

03:52.533 --> 03:55.000
Of my suspect, while
facing hostile numbers,

03:55.002 --> 03:57.569
I was unable to
secure the weapon.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.905
(tires screech)

03:59.907 --> 04:01.773
It was gone when mcguire
and rice arrived later?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.742
The place had been cleaned.
So, we have

04:03.744 --> 04:05.210
No way of verifying
what you're saying?

04:05.212 --> 04:06.545
You think I'm making this up?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.447
Look, dobson
was running

04:08.449 --> 04:10.349
Stolen military hardware
from out of there.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.351
That's why the missile
was there.
But you can't prove

04:12.353 --> 04:15.020
Any of this.
I could if I wasn't
sitting here.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.522
The sniper who shot dobson
wasn't apprehended.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.925
The houston field office
is still pursuing leads.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.261
What about the suspect
that mcguire and rice arrested

04:22.263 --> 04:24.396
At the garage?
Ray campbell was killed
by another prisoner

04:24.398 --> 04:25.864
In police custody.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.766
The same reason
evans and mccombs were murdered.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.434
It's damage control.
Simon:
Damage control.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.436
By whom?
Martin believes

04:31.438 --> 04:33.272
Dobson was working
for a military contractor

04:33.274 --> 04:34.906
Called verax.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.441
Verax global security?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.277
One of the top contractors
for the u.S. Military?

04:38.279 --> 04:41.280
Sounds like a conspiracy theory.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.281
(scoffs)

04:42.283 --> 04:44.449
This is a waste of time.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.118
The fact is
you were acting

04:46.120 --> 04:48.153
In an extralegal capacity
as a rogue agent.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.755
I was undercover.
Spiller:
It was never sanctioned.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.156
That's the bottom line.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.091
I've given dco wide latitude
in these matters...

04:53.093 --> 04:54.493
Gates:
I have no doubt agent odum

04:54.495 --> 04:56.228
Would've brought this case
into light.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.462
After racking up how many kills?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.997
After hijacking
how many more buses?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.300
I was doing what I could
to keep my prisoner alive.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.502
They still got him. That
should tell you something

05:03.504 --> 05:06.104
About who I was up against.
Gates:
Use of deadly force falls

05:06.106 --> 05:08.106
Under section 47
in the classified addendum

05:08.108 --> 05:09.408
Of the patriot act.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.576
Section 47 doesn't apply
if agent odum

05:11.578 --> 05:14.313
Acted without
sanction.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.647
Spiller: We're all grateful
for your service, martin.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.450
We have to assess
this situation honestly.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.086
Sounds like a fancy way
of calling me a liar, sir.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.997
Crystal:
Martin.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.302
Martin. Hey, martin.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.604
Wait a second.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.973
What the hell
happened in there?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.842
What'd they say
about verax?

05:43.844 --> 05:47.446
They sealed the case.
I'm in the dark.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.815
You have a problem with that,
you talk to gates.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.350
I am your handler.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.118
You work for me.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.286
I want to know.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.288
Soon. Not now.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.236
Are we on schedule?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.704
Clockwork.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.708
Pull out now
or we're officially pregnant.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.479
Americans speak of everything
in terms of sex or money.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.648
I'd throw football
in there, too.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.184
But not the kind you like.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.820
Real football.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.223
You wonder why you're hated
by the world.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.191
Used to wonder.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.227
Not anymore.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.462
What's it gonna
be, hassan?

06:38.364 --> 06:40.565
I'll be ready.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.572
(beeps)

06:47.574 --> 06:50.275
Be advised, we are a go.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.078
In 48 hours,
the prince will be dead.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.247
(beeps)

06:56.949 --> 06:58.850
(distant siren wailing)

06:58.852 --> 07:01.186
(knocking on door)

07:03.523 --> 07:05.724
Hi. Come in.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.860
Well, you're
still in the fbi.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.095
(door closes)

07:10.097 --> 07:11.596
How'd you pull
that one off?

07:11.598 --> 07:14.065
Absence of evidence is
not evidence of absence.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.200
Well done.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.569
Do you want a drink?
Hell yeah.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.771
Look, I don't have to tell you
that you're on thin ice, right?

07:19.773 --> 07:23.108
Yeah, I gathered that much.
You take a hit?

07:23.110 --> 07:26.578
Yeah. They transferred
tony rice to dco.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.747
Effective immediately.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.816
Ah.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.419
As long as I'm not working
with him.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.421
We have one hell
of a mess to clean up

07:36.423 --> 07:38.457
In texas to cover your ass.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.625
And, um,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.894
There's this.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.473
Have you managed to find
any others on the crew?

07:54.475 --> 07:55.440
A few names.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.142
All dead.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.577
But, martin,

07:58.579 --> 08:00.245
The photo's a fake.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.681
What are you talking about?

08:02.683 --> 08:05.116
Forensic analysis says
they've been doctored.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.618
Your head
on somebody else's body.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.321
Something about the pixels
not lining up.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.122
Look, it's all there
in the report.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.592
No, that's not possible.
You've never been

08:13.594 --> 08:14.759
To iraq, martin.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.162
Not in 2004. Not ever.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.831
Evans said I was there. Dobson.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.200
What about dobson? He said he
recognized me from over there.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.435
What, are they lying?

08:23.437 --> 08:25.036
A paranoid recluse

08:25.038 --> 08:27.138
And a guy who's trying
to talk himself out of custody.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.807
Telling you
what you want to hear.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.110
Now, no one's denying dobson
was involved in smuggling.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.445
Spiller's handing the case over

08:33.447 --> 08:34.846
To the joint terrorist
task force.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.781
But they're taking my case.
No, no, no.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.550
You've been ordered
to drop the matter.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.452
And, martin, I'm gonna say this
one last time.

08:40.454 --> 08:43.021
In 2004, you got
into a bad car accident.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.956
(tires screeching)
head trauma, memory loss,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.191
<i>Coma for three weeks.</i>

08:46.193 --> 08:47.292
You may not like that,

08:47.294 --> 08:48.460
But those are the facts.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.228
So let's accept it
and move on.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.564
No more rogue investigations,
martin.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.133
Now, I'm speaking to you
as a friend here.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.368
Do whatever it takes--

08:56.370 --> 08:59.004
Poetry, flowers,
I don't give a shit--

08:59.006 --> 09:01.172
Just get back together
with sonya.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.509
You need her.
She keeps you steady.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.145
Spend some time
with your son.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.747
Reconnect. Stop spinning.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.981
Stop tearing yourself apart.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.217
Martin,

09:12.219 --> 09:14.152
Remind yourself

09:14.154 --> 09:16.321
Who you are.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.062
(plays gentle melody)

09:26.198 --> 09:28.567
Sonya:
<i>You were in a car accident.</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:30.101
(siren wailing)

09:30.103 --> 09:31.202
When you woke up,

09:31.204 --> 09:33.004
You didn't
remember much.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.105
Not even me.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.907
Martin:
<i>This must have been</i>

09:35.909 --> 09:38.176
Manipulated somehow
'cause I was never there.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.511
Dobson:
We're the guys who don't exist,

09:39.513 --> 09:41.446
<i>Doing things</i>
<i>that didn't happen,</i>

09:41.448 --> 09:43.949
<i>Following the orders</i>
<i>that no one gave.</i>

09:43.951 --> 09:47.519
Gates:
<i>You've known me almost eight</i>
<i>years. You can't trust me?</i>

09:50.356 --> 09:52.123
Dead ringer.
What about the memory stuff?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.758
Mccombs:
<i>Everything about him is fake.</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:55.026
Don't mention that
to anyone else in the office.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.194
Sonya:
I know your name.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.263
It's martin macdonald odum.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.066
Dobson:
<i>What I do know,</i>
<i>he's supposed to be dead.</i>

10:01.068 --> 10:04.135
(men shouting, gunfire)

10:04.137 --> 10:06.771
(panting)

10:29.061 --> 10:33.064
Maggie:
I'm not even supposed to be
taking personal calls in here.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.967
No. Why are you acting
like this? You...

10:35.969 --> 10:38.303
You knew the deal
when you moved in.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.773
No, I said that I would
be working late sometimes.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.842
It's not every night.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.444
Okay, you know what,
I'm-I'm hanging up now.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.579
Bye.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.014
Hi.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.682
Tony, welcome aboard.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.083
Where should I, uh...
Uh,

10:52.085 --> 10:54.653
Follow me.
We-we set up your desk.

10:55.688 --> 10:58.023
Yeah.
Long hours, huh?

10:58.025 --> 11:00.825
Oh, that. Yeah.
That's my boyfriend.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.861
Sort of turning
into a disaster

11:02.863 --> 11:04.362
Since I took this job.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.997
Your wife--

11:05.999 --> 11:08.433
You might want to warn her
that you're not coming home.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.335
Like, ever.
(laughs)

11:10.337 --> 11:12.771
Yeah, I gathered that much.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.272
All right, uh...

11:14.274 --> 11:15.707
State department
briefing in an hour.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.009
Okay?
Yeah.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.649
This is prince abboud
of the house of saud.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.651
An invaluable partner
to this country,

11:26.653 --> 11:28.653
Which makes him an enemy
to a lot of people.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.789
He's under constant
threat of assassination.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.323
He just became
the oil minister, right?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.192
Important job for the kingdom.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.361
Second only to the king
himself, as I understand.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.029
The prince will be
in los angeles later

11:38.031 --> 11:40.231
This week for a highly
classified energy meeting

11:40.233 --> 11:42.500
At the arcadia
policy council.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.903
His visit had been under wraps.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.906
Two days ago, the prince's
classified itinerary

11:47.908 --> 11:50.008
Was leaked from someone
within the state department.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.177
Now cia intel
strongly suggests

11:52.179 --> 11:53.912
That there will
be an attempt

11:53.914 --> 11:55.180
On his life during this visit.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.648
Well, who at state had access?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.583
I assume you already
did an internal investigation?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.485
We did.
Rice: Prince abboud

12:00.487 --> 12:01.820
Won't reschedule the visit?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.188
That's not an option here.
We have 27 hours

12:03.190 --> 12:05.356
Before prince
abboud arrives.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.393
So you have
an unspecified threat. I...

12:08.395 --> 12:10.361
We have a person
of interest.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.930
His name is aaron rawley.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.400
He's a junior analyst in
our middle east department.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.235
He's written several
white papers denouncing

12:17.237 --> 12:18.937
The house of saud's
human rights record.

12:18.939 --> 12:22.240
So advocating for human rights
makes him a suspect?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.742
His papers are
essentially

12:23.744 --> 12:26.077
Polemics for regime change
in saudi arabia.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.178
How can dco help?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.279
If there's a threat--

12:28.281 --> 12:29.881
And rawley's
our guy--

12:29.883 --> 12:32.183
We need to know who he's
passing this information to.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.852
Let's test the leak.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.794
â™ª

12:44.797 --> 12:47.031
Thank you.

13:09.121 --> 13:15.627
â™ª my mind is clear
as a cloudless sky... â™ª

13:16.328 --> 13:17.495
Are you aaron rawley?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.564
Do I know you?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.499
(laughs): Sorry.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.101
Christine duncan.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.503
I read your paper on women's
rights in saudi arabia.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.139
Seriously?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.275
"strategies for the advancement
of women's rights"

13:30.277 --> 13:31.509
Or "the fire next time"?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.278
Both, actually.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.648
I'm advising keller on the
kingdom's proposed trade deals.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.983
You know, the saudis have the
best lobbyists money can buy.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.752
They don't want to hear
about enfranchising

13:40.754 --> 13:41.786
Saudi women, you know?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.922
You're probably right.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.825
You're not gonna believe
who's coming in tomorrow.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.429
(whispers):
Prince abboud.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.697
Seriously?

13:52.699 --> 13:54.766
The senator's meeting
with the prince

13:54.768 --> 13:57.468
During his visit.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.838
(laughs)

13:59.840 --> 14:03.274
I know a place near here
that's open late.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.477
Good drinks, excellent
conversation with fellow wonks.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.879
What do you say?

14:07.881 --> 14:10.014
I can't. You know, I
just got in from d.C.,

14:10.016 --> 14:12.317
And I've got to get up
at the crack of dawn.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.485
I'm in town
until Thursday.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.288
Take a rain check?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.857
Yes.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.392
Of course. Uh, this

14:21.394 --> 14:24.028
Is my cell.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.330
Nice to meet you.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.731
You as well.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.533
See you.
Bye.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.538
We're in play.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.573
Maggie:
You're such a tease,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.542
"christine duncan."

14:37.544 --> 14:39.344
Rice, are you guys in position?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.980
Yup, we're here and waiting.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.351
You like doing
this sort of stuff?

14:46.353 --> 14:47.852
What stuff?

14:47.854 --> 14:50.388
You know... Fishing.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.258
Waiting for a bite.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.093
It's part of the job, man.
It's the part of the job

14:55.095 --> 14:57.695
Where you sit with your
finger up your ass, isn't it?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.364
You gonna be whining all night?

14:59.366 --> 15:00.832
Hey, maggie,

15:00.834 --> 15:02.834
Where is this guy?
He hit up

15:02.836 --> 15:04.235
The drive-thru on the way home.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.438
He's approaching you guys
in a cab now.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.173
Rice:
Copy that.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.976
And there's our fish.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.750
(camera clicks)

15:19.518 --> 15:21.419
What's he
doing there?

15:23.789 --> 15:26.424
He just put something
in that cup.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.194
It's a dead drop.
Yeah, damn right, it is.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.463
It was subtle, too.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.900
See, that's spy-of-the-month,
right there.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.437
Let's go and have a look.
No, hold on, just wait.
Let's see who picks it up.

15:40.572 --> 15:42.206
Unless you prefer, I don't know,

15:42.208 --> 15:44.142
Going rogue
and kidnapping somebody?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.744
Yeah, if the occasion
calls for it, sure.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.646
You want to explain to me
what happened in houston?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.481
Not particularly.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.886
Let's just say I didn't find
what I was looking for.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.590
Ooh, who's this lady?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.793
Definitely not what I expected.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.762
(camera clicking)

16:04.764 --> 16:07.398
Maggie, we're sending
the photos to run on

16:07.400 --> 16:08.866
Facial recon.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.071
Wow, she almost
looks like, um...

16:15.574 --> 16:16.841
Oh, my god.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.243
It's her.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.278
It's hani jibril.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.913
I can't believe it.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.581
Wait a minute-- why does that
name sound familiar to me?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.984
Hani?
She's a famous activist
for women's rights.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.820
She's on tv, like, all the time.
Her book is amazing.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.955
Martin: Maggie, keep your eye
on rawley's building.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.424
We're following hani jibril.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.163
(engine starts)

16:40.766 --> 16:42.834
Crystal: <i>We don't know</i>
<i>what rawley told her</i>

16:42.836 --> 16:44.936
About the prince's visit
after we spoke.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.604
It's definitely not enough
to think that she

16:46.606 --> 16:47.705
Intends to assassinate him.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.173
Hani jibril is
not a killer.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.441
She's one of my heroes.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.310
She's a freedom
fighter who's put

16:52.312 --> 16:54.445
Her life on the line to stand
up for equal rights for women.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.347
Women can't vote
in saudi arabia,

16:56.349 --> 16:58.049
They can't drive, they
can't leave the house

16:58.051 --> 16:59.350
Alone without a
male escort.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.785
Maggie, I get it, okay?

17:00.787 --> 17:03.721
The fact is rawley passed
classified information

17:03.723 --> 17:06.290
To your hero.
She's involved.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.193
Look, I just... I need
to return some calls.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.299
She's on the move.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.069
Crystal:
You planning on following her?

17:18.071 --> 17:20.138
Yeah, we put a tracker
on her car.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.208
While she's out, we thought
we might do a bit of recon.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.979
Maggie, doesn't, uh, ms. Jibril

17:27.981 --> 17:29.480
Have some repairmen
coming today?

17:29.482 --> 17:30.882
No warrant there, cochise.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.718
National security exemption,
pocahontas.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.156
Martin, just be very discreet.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.557
Sure.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.994
Repairmen.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.662
Don't we need, like,
uniforms or something?

17:44.664 --> 17:47.899
You do. I just carry a box
that looks like

17:47.901 --> 17:50.001
It's got tools in it.
Put that on.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.537
The arab spring is far

17:52.539 --> 17:54.906
From a revolution in bloom.

17:56.508 --> 17:59.210
Put the badge on.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.380
Yet the voices of discontent
are no longer silent.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.583
Hello, you've reached
hani jibril.
Jibril's voice: Hello,

18:05.585 --> 18:06.851
You've reached hani jibril.
Or a reasonable

18:06.853 --> 18:08.352
Digital facsimile.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.954
Jibril's voice: Or a reasonable
digital facsimile.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.191
Definitely something about this
is making me very uncomfortable.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.459
(typing)

18:14.461 --> 18:16.461
Not without prior approval
of the resident.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.695
It's just building
policy, guys.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.630
Oh, come on,
give us a break.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.866
We've come all the way from
balboa park, in traffic.
(phone ringing)

18:21.868 --> 18:23.801
Yeah?

18:23.803 --> 18:26.204
Yes. This is hani jibril.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.039
Apartment 204.
Jibril's voice: Apartment 204.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.241
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention
that the dishwasher repairman

18:30.243 --> 18:31.876
Was scheduled to stop by.
Jibril's voice: I'm sorry,
I forgot to mention

18:31.878 --> 18:33.211
That the dishwasher repairman
was scheduled to stop by.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.879
You can let him
into the apartment.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.080
Of course, ms. Jibril.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.415
Of course.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.716
(hangs up phone)

18:39.785 --> 18:42.120
I should not be
any part of this.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.324
So, uh, since when does it take
two guys to fix a dishwasher?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.392
Well, my buddy
here's a trainee.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.328
Yeah.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.563
Right.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.166
(scoffs)
trainee.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.568
Ha.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.505
I tell you--

19:00.507 --> 19:02.106
This does not look
like an assassin's

19:02.108 --> 19:03.674
Apartment, though, does it?

19:03.676 --> 19:06.344
No weird, random, obsessive

19:06.346 --> 19:09.113
Images on the walls.
(chuckles)

19:09.115 --> 19:11.916
Most bad guys I know
don't have such good taste.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.185
Wow.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.821
Dalai lama, aung san suu kyi.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.023
Well, you think
you know a person.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.393
Let's get to work.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.209
(camera clicking)

19:38.211 --> 19:39.544
Hey, rice.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.546
Look at this.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.648
Rawley took the bait
from crystal.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.849
Passed the information
on to ms. Jibril.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.284
"senator keller
to meet abboud."

19:46.286 --> 19:47.852
Proves he's the leak.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.554
We know she's a critic
of the kingdom,

19:49.556 --> 19:51.856
But does that make
her an assassin?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.725
Let's find out.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.794
Upload her hard drive.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.036
(computer chirping)

20:11.743 --> 20:13.811
Hey, rice,

20:13.813 --> 20:15.413
Is it just me,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.982
Or does the shutterbug
outside seem interested in us?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.521
No, it's definitely
not just you.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.356
Tell you what.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.024
I'll look busy,

20:27.026 --> 20:28.392
Keep your friend interested,

20:28.394 --> 20:30.995
While you go outside
and introduce yourself.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.064
Yeah.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.566
(door opens)

20:35.568 --> 20:37.802
(door closes)

20:48.080 --> 20:50.114
Fbi.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.150
Move, and I'll blow
your teeth out.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.421
(groaning)

21:03.028 --> 21:05.963
Ah. Wow.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.199
Ruger m1911.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.067
Pricey.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.969
You got a license for this?

21:11.971 --> 21:14.472
You make a mistake.
Call the saudi embassy.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.374
What are you doing down here
watching us, huh?

21:16.376 --> 21:19.644
I wasn't watching you!

21:19.646 --> 21:23.381
Ahmed nomar hassan.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.549
Where are you from, ahmed?

21:25.551 --> 21:26.751
I said, call the saudi embassy.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.985
I have diplomatic
immunity.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.521
(chuckles)

21:38.897 --> 21:40.765
Gates:
Yes, sir.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.400
I understand, sir.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.902
Yes. Will do.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.778
He checks out.
Bullshit.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.813
He had hani jibril
under surveillance.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.815
Let me have a go
at him first.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.083
That's not gonna happen.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.985
Look, this guy's
wrong, nelson.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.020
I'm telling you,
releasing him's a bad idea.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.322
Look, we have aaron rawley
under surveillance.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.623
We can keep eyes
on hassan, as well.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.191
What? Like, he
can't lose a tail?

22:07.193 --> 22:09.193
I don't like it, either,
but that's the play here.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.429
(elevator doors open)

22:13.465 --> 22:16.801
I'm afraid we owe you
an apology, mr. Hassan.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.502
I spoke to an official
at the state department

22:18.504 --> 22:20.104
Who has been in contact
with saudi officials.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.206
They confirm
you have diplomatic status.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.941
We're gonna be sending
your gun to the embassy.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.510
You work for saudi intelligence?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.713
I don't have
to answer your questions.
Just tell us

22:28.715 --> 22:30.214
What you were doing watching
ms. Jibril's apartment.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.615
Same thing you were, I assume.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.617
Checking her out for
possible involvement

22:33.619 --> 22:35.119
In an assassination plot.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.956
Hani jibril

22:38.958 --> 22:40.224
Is a vocal enemy of the kingdom.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.826
She has made
provocative comments

22:41.828 --> 22:43.461
To achieve her
political agenda.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.230
Am I free to go?

22:47.332 --> 22:49.533
Are we done?
We're done.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.339
(door buzzes, opens)

22:55.341 --> 22:57.341
(door closes)

22:57.343 --> 23:01.645
I went through the contents of
hani's hard drive, and I found

23:01.647 --> 23:03.247
Prince abboud's
itinerary on it.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.484
Seems to me we have
a split decision on ms. Jibril.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.419
On the one hand,
her agenda seems primarily

23:08.421 --> 23:10.755
To be about human rights,
not about killing people.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.056
Crystal:
And on the other,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.657
She's made
clandestine arrangements

23:13.659 --> 23:15.259
To find out
the secret itinerary

23:15.261 --> 23:17.361
Of her sworn enemy's
movements.

23:17.363 --> 23:18.496
I think that we...

23:18.498 --> 23:20.331
She's planning a protest.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.404
I think we need
to find more information.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.239
Then let's get more information.

23:28.241 --> 23:33.077
Rice, martin, I want you to
approach hani jibril in legend.

23:33.945 --> 23:35.546
As sebastian egan?

23:35.548 --> 23:37.515
That was my thought.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.717
You're sebastian egan?

23:39.719 --> 23:40.851
My favorite legend.

23:40.853 --> 23:41.952
Why is that?

23:41.954 --> 23:43.020
Well, for one, he drinks.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.789
Not just drinks.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.458
He drinks scotch out of a coffee
cup at 10:00 in the morning.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.561
<i>Writer, journalist,</i>

23:50.563 --> 23:52.129
<i>Professional contrarian.</i>

23:52.131 --> 23:55.800
<i>Never met a sacred cow</i>
<i>he didn't try to slay.</i>

23:55.802 --> 23:58.736
<i>He's a disillusioned socialist</i>
<i>turned gadfly wit,</i>

23:58.738 --> 24:02.473
<i>Turned seditionist,</i>
<i>turned blasphemer.</i>

24:02.475 --> 24:05.476
<i>Sebastian egan is</i>
<i>the most famous journalist</i>

24:05.478 --> 24:07.912
<i>No one's ever met.</i>

24:07.914 --> 24:10.114
Who drinks.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.755
Jibril: These fanatics have
far too much power.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.291
They are bullies and criminals.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.793
You cannot reason with them.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.564
What women have to endure
in saudi arabia is criminal.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.468
Justice must be claimed
by any means necessary.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.470
I think the flaws
that were born with the faith--

24:32.472 --> 24:34.638
The treatment of women,
the lack of freedom,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.073
The pre-medieval way of life--

24:36.075 --> 24:37.975
Lives on into
the 21st century

24:37.977 --> 24:39.844
Only because of the
fanatics' influence.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.680
And now I'll field
some questions.

24:42.682 --> 24:43.914
Ms. Jibril,

24:43.916 --> 24:45.683
Have you considered
the possibility

24:45.685 --> 24:47.818
That these fanatics,
as you call them,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.820
Were driven to
this fanaticism

24:49.822 --> 24:53.023
Because of a long list of crimes
committed by the United States?

24:53.025 --> 24:54.492
That they visit

24:54.494 --> 24:56.827
Atrocities on us
because...
Sir,

24:56.829 --> 24:58.629
Make no mistake.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.798
Modern democracy is at war
with radical islam.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.933
There is no middle
ground in war.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.703
There comes a moment
when you must crush your enemy.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.137
Militarily?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.806
In all forms.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.307
(martin chuckles)

25:10.309 --> 25:13.310
And there we have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.814
We see how far
the rot has spread, and how

25:16.816 --> 25:18.816
Tragically the foundations
have crumbled.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.451
I'd just like to say,

25:20.453 --> 25:22.486
I'm, uh, with ms. Jibril
on this one.

25:22.488 --> 25:25.055
I think we should fight
theocracy all the way.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.726
For free speech,
for women's rights, for a more

25:28.728 --> 25:30.561
Pluralistic democracy.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.897
And I think you, sir,
should be ashamed

25:32.899 --> 25:36.800
For mocking the very people
who guard you while you sleep.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.403
(applause)

25:47.145 --> 25:49.313
â™ª

25:54.586 --> 25:56.820
Anybody ever told egan
he drinks too much?

25:56.822 --> 25:59.089
Yes, but I don't listen
to bad advice.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.258
Booze nourishes the spirit.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.662
Hence, the categorical
name, "spirits."

26:04.664 --> 26:07.398
(chuckles)

26:08.767 --> 26:11.368
I'd like to thank you
for your vocal support in there.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.037
Ah, my duty.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.772
Sebastian egan.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.207
The infamous
sebastian egan?

26:17.209 --> 26:19.610
I thought your piece
on jamaah islamiah was vital.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.512
Thank you. I don't
publish that often,

26:21.514 --> 26:23.881
But when I do, I try
to make it count.

26:23.883 --> 26:27.451
This is my trusted
comrade, helmut newton.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.053
Tony baldwin.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.588
We're here on assignment
for <i>joust.</i>

26:30.590 --> 26:32.256
You mind if I grab a couple

26:32.258 --> 26:34.458
Candids of you?
Certainly.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.527
(camera clicking)
are you aware of

26:36.529 --> 26:37.962
Prince abboud's
visit this week?

26:37.964 --> 26:39.597
Mm, I've heard rumors.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.599
I assume you'll
be there, right?

26:41.601 --> 26:43.534
Organizing a protest
of some kind?

26:43.536 --> 26:46.203
(camera clicking)

26:46.205 --> 26:48.672
I've got something special
planned for the prince.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.544
I'm making a film.

26:53.546 --> 26:56.080
Hoping to confront him
on camera, let the world see.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.649
I'd love for you two
to cover it, actually.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.117
Yes.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.086
Uh... For posterity?

27:02.088 --> 27:03.253
For publicity.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.622
(chuckles)

27:04.624 --> 27:07.224
Excuse me.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.305
So, what do you think?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.907
I think she's an incredible
woman, that's what I think.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.243
You're telling me

27:26.245 --> 27:28.345
This woman wants
to assassinate a saudi prince?

27:29.781 --> 27:32.516
Nah, of course not.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.618
So, what, you-you think
I'm being blind here?

27:34.620 --> 27:36.587
That I'm not seeing her
for who she really is?

27:36.589 --> 27:38.122
What about you?

27:38.124 --> 27:40.891
You ever get played
while you were under?

27:42.027 --> 27:43.427
You disappear for weeks on end.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.029
No calls, nothing,
and then you show up,

27:45.031 --> 27:46.764
And you don't even know
who you are half the time.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.266
<i>It's martin odum.</i>

27:49.268 --> 27:51.635
You have to stay
objective.

27:51.637 --> 27:55.105
Part of the job.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.224
(beeping)

28:16.294 --> 28:19.830
Aaron:
It's me. I need to see you.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.666
Usual spot, tomorrow, 3:30.

28:22.668 --> 28:25.369
It's almost time.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.641
â™ª

29:05.543 --> 29:08.412
We're on, but I think they know
I leaked the itinerary.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.782
We have to limit contact--
no e-mails, no drops, nothing.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.016
They might be watching now.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.852
I'm sorry you're
in this position.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.553
Don't be. I wanted to help.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.289
I won't have the details of the
prince's motorcade assignment

29:19.291 --> 29:21.091
Until tomorrow.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.060
Security's getting tight.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.862
I understand.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.697
Thank you, aaron,

29:26.699 --> 29:28.198
For taking the risk.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.700
Happy to do it, hani.

29:29.702 --> 29:32.569
I believe in your cause.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.204
I'll contact you

29:34.206 --> 29:36.206
On this burner phone.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.180
(door opens)

29:43.982 --> 29:45.949
(door closes)

29:49.888 --> 29:52.122
Sonya?

29:57.729 --> 29:59.763
Uh, do you want a...

29:59.765 --> 30:02.266
Do you want a beer?

30:02.268 --> 30:04.301
Sure.

30:05.904 --> 30:07.771
What are you doing here?

30:07.773 --> 30:09.807
I wanted to talk to you.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.309
I don't know
how to say this.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.145
I've been doing a lot
of thinking.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.248
About you. About us.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.818
About whether we should
be together or not.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.821
One day I think we should,
the next day I don't.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.456
I asked aiden what he thought.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.458
What did he say?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.494
What do you think he said?

30:30.496 --> 30:33.263
I don't know.
That we should be together.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.199
Of course.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.202
I couldn't decide,
so the other night I...

30:38.204 --> 30:40.437
I watched the video
of our wedding.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.439
Maybe I should watch that.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.410
So I can remember where it was.
(chuckles)

30:47.345 --> 30:50.214
Just kidding. It was in malibu.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.448
At our wedding,

30:51.450 --> 30:53.350
We exchanged vows.
Do you remember?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.985
To stick together.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.520
Richer or poorer.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.955
In sickness
and in health.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.323
Where is this coming from?

30:59.325 --> 31:01.892
I just realized
that we should try harder.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.861
That we shouldn't
give in.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.297
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.132
I want to be with you.

31:09.134 --> 31:12.836
I'm crazy, remember?

31:12.838 --> 31:14.872
(chuckles)

31:14.874 --> 31:17.207
A lot of issues.
I realize
it's not gonna

31:17.209 --> 31:20.377
Be easy, that we have a lot
of stuff to work through.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.046
You have things you
have to work through.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.482
But I want to try.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.218
Together.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.823
I don't want to give
up on our family.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.962
(sighs)

31:39.998 --> 31:42.833
Thanks for giving me
another chance.

31:59.550 --> 32:00.918
Gates:
<i>The prince's motorcade</i>

32:00.920 --> 32:02.085
<i>From the van nuys airport</i>

32:02.087 --> 32:03.587

32:03.589 --> 32:04.922
<i>In santa monica. His itinerary</i>

32:04.924 --> 32:07.024

laid the groundwork

32:18.070 --> 32:19.703
For the internet;
also rumored

32:19.705 --> 32:23.206
To be planning world domination
and a new world order.

32:24.142 --> 32:25.943
Sorry. I'll take off
the tinfoil.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.446
Nsa is monitoring all comms on a
designated channel, so we'll be

32:29.448 --> 32:32.416
Fully aware of his movements.
Tell me again

32:32.418 --> 32:34.117
Why the prince didn't change
his plans.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.986
The prince is meeting
with the most powerful people

32:35.988 --> 32:37.587
In the energy complex.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.323
Which means the most powerful
people in the world.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.291
These people don't reschedule.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.794
Ms. Jibril

32:43.796 --> 32:47.497
Is lining up a protest
at the arcadia policy council.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.633
If she's part
of an assassination plot,

32:49.635 --> 32:51.335
We expect it will go down there.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.570
<i>All agents will stay in</i>

On one side,
the prince,

33:07.686 --> 33:11.188
With his trillions
in oil wealth,

33:11.190 --> 33:14.791
The protection
of the world energy oligarchy.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.259
On your side,

33:16.261 --> 33:18.762
Poster paper and sharpies.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.564
Let's not forget justice.

33:22.033 --> 33:23.867
Maggie:
Rice, what's the situation?

33:23.869 --> 33:26.603
We've got eyes on ms. Jibril.
Everything's status quo.

<i>will be heavily guarded.</i>

33:31.010 --> 33:33.343
<i>If there's going</i>
<i>to be an attack,</i>

33:33.345 --> 33:36.546
<i>Chances are it will occur</i>
<i>outside of arcadia's complex.</i>

33:36.548 --> 33:38.448
Maggie:
We've got a lock
on the prince's location.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.718
He's closing in on arcadia.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.186
Nsa intercepts

33:43.188 --> 33:45.956
<i>Say no suspicious chatter</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

33:45.958 --> 33:47.557
So just how far
are you prepared to go,

33:47.559 --> 33:50.127
Ms. Jibril?
To effect suffrage
in saudi arabia?

33:50.129 --> 33:52.162
To the death.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.364
Yours or his?

33:57.001 --> 33:59.002
Crowd (chanting):
Justice! Justice!

33:59.004 --> 34:00.570
Here comes his highness.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.506
The prince's motorcade
just arrived.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.474
Gates:
Keep eyes on hani.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.410
You seem rather quiet,

34:06.412 --> 34:08.578
Ms. Jibril. You're not
going to join them?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.680
It's not time.

34:10.682 --> 34:13.417
Just make sure you have enough
battery-- you're the witness.

34:13.419 --> 34:16.653
Crowd (chanting):
Justice! Justice! Justice!

34:16.655 --> 34:18.088
(chanting continues)

34:21.359 --> 34:23.660
Stay sharp, people.
Where's the prince now?

34:23.662 --> 34:25.395
(chanting continues)

34:25.397 --> 34:27.497
Rice:
He just got out of the car.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.769
Welcome, your highness.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.004
It's good to see you again.

34:34.006 --> 34:35.105
Likewise.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.940
Really, you shouldn't have.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.608
(chuckles)
please. This way.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.912
Maggie:
The prince is heading inside.
All clear.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.347
(chanting continues)

34:44.349 --> 34:47.684
Rice:
I'm not sure
what she's planning to do,

34:47.686 --> 34:49.386
But she seems nervous.

34:49.388 --> 34:53.223
And we realized we needed a
sense of the big picture.

34:53.225 --> 34:57.861
So, back in 2006,
the arcadia policy council,

34:57.863 --> 35:01.531
Hand in hand with the center
for middle eastern politics,

35:01.533 --> 35:03.266
Set up a program
to assess thoroughly

35:03.268 --> 35:06.770
The world's energy needs
through the next half-century...

35:06.772 --> 35:09.473
(phone ringing)
(chanting): Justice now!
Justice for women!

35:09.475 --> 35:13.477
Justice now! Justice for women!
Justice now!

35:13.479 --> 35:16.480
Aaron:
The prince will not be coming
out of the north entrance.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.281
They will attempt a diversion.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.549
Crystal:
<i>Hani's on her phone.</i>

35:19.551 --> 35:20.617
Who's she talking to?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.551
That's not her regular phone.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.321
I'll use the stingray.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.224
He'll be exiting
through the east wing,

35:27.226 --> 35:29.392
And his security detail
will be minimal.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.660
You can approach him there.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.928
Maggie:
That's rawley.

35:31.930 --> 35:32.929
Gates:
This thing is going down.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.297
We got to find him now.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.934
(chanting):
Justice for women! Justice now!

35:37.936 --> 35:39.503
Gates: What do you have, maggie?
Maggie: Hang on.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.404
The signal bounced off
a relay node.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.406
I have to break
through the firewall.

35:43.408 --> 35:45.976
Gates:
Make it fast.
Jibril: Okay, everybody,

35:45.978 --> 35:48.311
It's around the back
of the building. Let's go.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.313
Not planning anything
too dramatic, are you?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.349
I certainly hope so.
Look, uh,

35:52.351 --> 35:55.185
I wouldn't try any sudden moves
if I were you.

35:55.187 --> 35:59.422
Royal security can get a bit
twitchy, in my experience.

35:59.424 --> 36:00.991
I'm armed only with the truth.

36:01.759 --> 36:02.993
That's enough.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.263
Let's follow her.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.998
We hope that this joint report

36:08.000 --> 36:10.367
Will provide some measure
of guidance

36:10.369 --> 36:12.435
For the important decisions
to come.

36:12.437 --> 36:13.937
Decisions, that together,

36:13.939 --> 36:15.539
We will make for
our mutual benefit.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.774
Thank you.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.844
(applause)

36:27.051 --> 36:29.019
(whirring)

36:37.128 --> 36:39.362
(men speaking arabic)

36:40.665 --> 36:41.898
(tires screech)

36:41.900 --> 36:43.633
Maggie:
Okay, I got rawley's location.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.835
Gates:
Crystal, move to intercept. Now.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.771
Send backup. I'm on my way.

36:48.839 --> 36:50.574
The motorcade is on the move.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.876
Find rawley and hold him
until the prince is clear.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.712
(chanting):
Justice! Justice! Justice!

36:55.714 --> 36:58.081
(chanting continues)

36:59.717 --> 37:02.152
Gates:
We've got rawley's position.

37:02.154 --> 37:03.720
Martin, keep eyes on hani.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.056
What the hell
is she thinking?

37:06.058 --> 37:08.525
Hopefully not martyrdom.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.926
(horn honks)

37:09.928 --> 37:12.662
(tires screech)

37:12.664 --> 37:14.531
(horn honks)

37:14.533 --> 37:16.466
I wish to speak to the prince.

37:17.335 --> 37:20.170
(horn honking)

37:21.105 --> 37:22.405
I will talk to her.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.773
Crystal:
Maggie, where am I going?

37:23.775 --> 37:25.609
At the end of the road,
take a right.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.711
Just down the alley.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.412
Hello, ms. Jibril.

37:29.414 --> 37:32.382
The time has come to change
the appalling way the kingdom

37:32.384 --> 37:34.017
Treats its women.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.419
You promised me you would
fix this, do you remember?

37:36.421 --> 37:38.188
Hani, I assure you...
You said

37:38.190 --> 37:41.091
You would champion suffrage
for all women, did you not?

37:41.093 --> 37:44.194
I told you I would. Please
do not do this here, I beg you.

37:44.196 --> 37:45.562
Martin:
Hani.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.264
Guard:
Get the camera!
Hey, hey!

37:47.266 --> 37:49.032
Hani! Hani!
Don't touch the camera.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.934
Get out of here, man.
This is america.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.804
(speaking arabic)

37:54.806 --> 37:56.873
There's no one here!

37:56.875 --> 37:57.941
He should be right
in front of you.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.442
I still see the signal.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.445
Gates:
Talk to me, crystal.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.781
I just found the phone.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.717
Maggie,

38:07.719 --> 38:08.952
Where is he?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.820
Gates:
Martin, rice,

38:10.822 --> 38:13.189
We don't have rawley. Get the
prince out of there right now.

38:14.892 --> 38:15.959
Shoot me.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.927
I will not wear
this veil.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.896
If I die, I die for all women.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.965
Hani. Hani,
you've made your point.
They will rise up

38:21.967 --> 38:24.901
And avenge me and you will lose
this abomination forever.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.436
This publicity stunt
does not help matters!

38:26.438 --> 38:28.338
Martin:
Get back in the car,
your highness.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.473
Time to go.
You've made your point.
No, I'm not leaving. No!

38:30.475 --> 38:32.242
Let go of me.
You want to get shot?

38:32.244 --> 38:34.644
(whirring)

38:37.682 --> 38:38.982
Shit!

38:45.089 --> 38:47.190
(muffled explosions, shouting)

38:59.103 --> 39:00.103
(explosion)

39:00.105 --> 39:02.339
(ears ringing)

39:13.617 --> 39:14.951
(explosion)

39:25.463 --> 39:28.131
Man:
Ms. Jibril.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.033
You're coming
with me.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.468
Wh...

39:36.507 --> 39:38.775
(distant siren wailing)

39:52.857 --> 39:56.726
