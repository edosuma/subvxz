00:02.297 --> 00:03.697
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:03.697 --> 00:06.330
Cafe Tavolini
is a hot Italian mess.

00:06.330 --> 00:07.497
This place is pathetic.

00:07.497 --> 00:08.597
Want anything else?
Ohh.

00:08.597 --> 00:09.963
A sick bag maybe.

00:09.963 --> 00:11.430
And to make matters worse,

00:11.430 --> 00:14.563
Chef Ramsay finds himself
in the middle of a family war.

00:14.563 --> 00:15.663
He's here to help us.

00:15.663 --> 00:17.297
Don't let me
elbow you.

00:17.297 --> 00:19.697
Keith and Lisa Restivo
may own the restaurant,

00:19.697 --> 00:21.263
But they are certainly
not running it.

00:21.263 --> 00:23.230
Customers aren't gonna care
about your business

00:23.230 --> 00:25.497
if you don't give a
about it.

00:25.497 --> 00:26.630
Fed up with their
dying business...

00:26.630 --> 00:28.063
I don't even want
to come here tonight.

00:28.063 --> 00:29.597
It's a nightmare.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.000
They are now the epitome
of absentee owners.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.797
They are now the epitome
of absentee owners.

00:31.797 --> 00:33.097
Where's Lisa?
Where's Keith?

00:33.097 --> 00:34.963
How much more can I do?

00:34.963 --> 00:36.230
Without any leadership,

00:36.230 --> 00:38.530
This restaurant
is completely dysfunctional.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.630
It's a joke!

00:39.630 --> 00:41.097
And it's placing

00:41.097 --> 00:42.963
A heavy burden
on Lisa's son and daughter.

00:42.963 --> 00:44.830
I'm being honest--that you're
never at your restaurant.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.697
Who closed your restaurant
every night?

00:46.697 --> 00:49.597
With Cafe Tavolini serving
as the family battleground...

00:49.597 --> 00:51.197
I don't understand
how I'm  lying.

00:51.197 --> 00:53.730
I can't take it.
Shut up!

00:53.730 --> 00:56.330
There's more than just
the business that's on the line.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.763
I just want to hand him
divorce papers.

00:57.763 --> 00:59.030
Can Chef Ramsay

00:59.030 --> 01:00.000
Pull this dysfunctional
restaurant together?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.097
Pull this dysfunctional
restaurant together?

01:01.097 --> 01:04.263
I can't help owners
that can't help themselves.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.963
Or is this eatery
beyond saving?

01:05.963 --> 01:08.063
Close that door!

01:08.063 --> 01:10.030
It's confusion
in Connecticut...

01:10.030 --> 01:11.563
You're out of business.

01:11.563 --> 01:14.697
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares.

01:32.764 --> 01:34.164
Bridgeport, Connecticut--

01:34.164 --> 01:36.930
an industrial city
on the Connecticut coast,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.364
only an hour north
of Manhattan.

01:39.364 --> 01:42.797
Nestled in a quaint neighborhood
called black rock

01:42.797 --> 01:44.864
is Cafe Tavolini.

01:44.864 --> 01:46.597
Owners Keith
and Lisa Restivo

01:46.597 --> 01:50.030
bought a successful
Italian restaurant on a whim,

01:50.030 --> 01:52.430
having never worked
in the business before.

01:52.430 --> 01:54.697
Lisa and I were driving
past this building,

01:54.697 --> 01:58.030
and there was
a "For Rent" sign on it.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.930
We didn't know
the restaurant business.

01:59.930 --> 02:00.000
I'm a hairdresser by trade,
and Keith owned liquor stores.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.530
I'm a hairdresser by trade,
and Keith owned liquor stores.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.130
We had no clue.

02:03.130 --> 02:05.397
Nice to see you.
How are you, honey?

02:05.397 --> 02:06.697
When the place opened up,
it was mobbed.

02:06.697 --> 02:09.264
Doing great numbers.
Everybody was happy.

02:09.264 --> 02:10.164
Is your steak
cooked all right?

02:10.164 --> 02:11.664
It's perfect.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.097
We were the newest
restaurant around,

02:14.097 --> 02:16.230
and we were definitely riding
the wave of success.

02:18.464 --> 02:20.130
Now you walk in here
on a Saturday night,

02:20.130 --> 02:22.297
you'd think that it's like
a  old Western movie,

02:22.297 --> 02:25.197
like  things
are rolling by.

02:26.464 --> 02:27.830
I don't even want
to come here tonight.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.630
Our business started
to turn negative.

02:29.630 --> 02:30.000
We started to turn negative
with it also.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.430
We started to turn negative
with it also.

02:32.430 --> 02:34.764
This place is really
driving me crazy.

02:34.764 --> 02:37.064
My mother and Keith
do not care.

02:37.064 --> 02:38.764
The two of them
hate being here.

02:38.764 --> 02:40.264
Oh, my God.

02:40.264 --> 02:41.297
Michael, I hate
to bother you.

02:41.297 --> 02:42.664
Do you have my car keys,
by chance?

02:42.664 --> 02:46.197
I try to oversee the full
operation of the restaurant.

02:49.264 --> 02:51.364
I don't really know what Keith
does here--I really don't.

02:51.364 --> 02:52.864
Don't tell me to clean.

02:52.864 --> 02:54.697
Um...

02:56.730 --> 02:58.364
Um...

03:00.197 --> 03:01.897
He'll act like
he's the boss.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.964
He says, "I'm busy, I'm busy.
I gotta go, I gotta go."

03:03.964 --> 03:06.630
But what are you so busy with?
You don't do anything all day.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.264
You sleep till  2:00.

03:08.264 --> 03:09.597
You come here,
you blow the patio,

03:09.597 --> 03:10.864
and then you
sit home all day.

03:10.864 --> 03:11.930
Come here.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.230
You lay down here too.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.964
I wish I had
your  life.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.397
Why aren't the lights on
in the restaurant

03:19.397 --> 03:21.964
at 5:30 at night?

03:21.964 --> 03:24.330
What frustrates me is the lack
of management, period.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.597
You know,
he'll sit at home

03:25.597 --> 03:26.930
and stare
at the surveillance camera,

03:26.930 --> 03:28.564
and he basically nitpicks.

03:28.564 --> 03:30.000
Why is everybody
sitting down here?

03:30.000 --> 03:30.064
Why is everybody
sitting down here?

03:30.064 --> 03:32.230
If you have

03:32.230 --> 03:33.564
This much money
into a place,

03:33.564 --> 03:35.297
why aren't you there when
the place isn't working?

03:35.297 --> 03:38.497
The numbers
are just ridiculous.

03:38.497 --> 03:42.330
And I cannot pay bills
with no money.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.530
We're probably in debt
$350,000.

03:45.530 --> 03:46.930
This is what's
gonna have to happen.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.797
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

03:48.797 --> 03:51.764
Our marriage is at a brink,
because we fight constantly.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.497
Fighting and fighting
and fighting

03:53.497 --> 03:56.064
is not gonna get
anyone anywhere.

03:56.064 --> 03:57.664
We need Chef Ramsay's help,

03:57.664 --> 04:00.000
because we are at the end
of our ropes.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.030
because we are at the end
of our ropes.

04:01.030 --> 04:02.997
If things don't change,

04:02.997 --> 04:06.497
I don't know
what is gonna happen.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.097
If they don't take
Gordon's advice,

04:09.097 --> 04:11.364
The marriage is gonna fail,
and the restaurant's gonna fail.

04:19.597 --> 04:21.597
Cafe Tavolini.

04:21.597 --> 04:25.230
Chef Ramsay is aware that
Cafe Tavolini has its issues...

04:25.230 --> 04:26.997
Taste of Italy.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.797
But before he can step
in the door to explore...

04:29.797 --> 04:30.000
Hi, Gordon.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.697
Hi, Gordon.

04:31.697 --> 04:34.164
There is one family member
who can't wait to unload.

04:34.164 --> 04:35.464
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Van cotto.

04:35.464 --> 04:37.230
Can I talk to you for a quick
second before we go in?

04:37.230 --> 04:38.197
Now?
Yeah.

04:38.197 --> 04:39.664
Jump in.
Jump in.

04:39.664 --> 04:42.030
I wanted to meet up
with Chef Ramsay,

04:42.030 --> 04:44.564
Because I wanted to tell him
every little bit of dirt.

04:44.564 --> 04:46.897
You obviously got something
important to tell me.

04:46.897 --> 04:48.297
- Yeah.
- First of all...

04:48.297 --> 04:50.197
It's a family business,
right?
Yeah, family run.

04:50.197 --> 04:51.630
And it's your mum and dad
who owns it.

04:51.630 --> 04:52.797
My mother
and my stepfather, yes.

04:52.797 --> 04:53.797
Mum and stepfather.

04:53.797 --> 04:54.830
And--are they in there?

04:54.830 --> 04:56.264
Yes, he is in there.

04:56.264 --> 04:57.630
I just wanted
to let you know

04:57.630 --> 04:59.564
that the only reason
why he's there today

04:59.564 --> 05:00.000
is 'cause he found out
that you were coming there.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.064
is 'cause he found out
that you were coming there.

05:01.064 --> 05:02.864
So he's not hands-on?

05:02.864 --> 05:04.730
No, he'd be in bed
right now, actually,

05:04.730 --> 05:05.797
if you weren't coming.

05:05.797 --> 05:06.830
You're kidding me.

05:06.830 --> 05:07.897
He's lost.

05:07.897 --> 05:09.097
Uhh!
He needs your help.

05:09.097 --> 05:10.230
And what does mum do?

05:10.230 --> 05:12.797
She just basically
doesn't wanna be there.

05:12.797 --> 05:15.530
He blames her for everything
for not being successful.

05:15.530 --> 05:16.897
It's always her fault.

05:16.897 --> 05:19.330
Van, thanks for the heads-up.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.197
Let's just keep this,
um, between us.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.164
Take care, bud.

05:22.164 --> 05:23.897
Take it easy.
Thanks, Van.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.000
Ah. Ah, it's freezing.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.530
Ah. Ah, it's freezing.

05:32.530 --> 05:33.697
Hi. How are you?

05:33.697 --> 05:35.064
Hey, Mr. Ramsay.
How are you?

05:35.064 --> 05:36.097
Gordon, please.
Good to see you.

05:36.097 --> 05:37.097
And so
your first name is...

05:37.097 --> 05:38.397
Uh, Keith Restivo.
Keith.

05:38.397 --> 05:39.497
Manager? Owner?

05:39.497 --> 05:40.797
Owner, yes...
Hi.

05:40.797 --> 05:42.030
Along with
my wife Lisa.
Hi. Lisa.

05:42.030 --> 05:43.064
Lisa, good to see you.

05:43.064 --> 05:45.630
So husband-and-wife team.
Yes.

05:45.630 --> 05:48.030
Any other members of the family
working in the restaurant?

05:48.030 --> 05:49.264
Yes, they do.
My son, Van.

05:49.264 --> 05:50.597
Okay.
And my daughter, Joli.

05:50.597 --> 05:52.264
So restaurant's open
how many days a week?

05:52.264 --> 05:53.964
Seven days a week.
Seven, and you're here--

05:53.964 --> 05:55.297
I'm here almost every day.

05:57.497 --> 05:59.430
I actually don't work
during the day.

06:00.530 --> 06:03.297
Hello.
And this is...

06:03.297 --> 06:04.497
This is Van.
Nice to meet you.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.564
Okay, you do...

06:05.564 --> 06:07.297
Yeah, work here.
Waiter.

06:07.297 --> 06:09.364
Now, how many times
a week are you here?

06:09.364 --> 06:11.064
Four to five.
Four to five.

06:11.064 --> 06:12.197
So you're here
six days a week.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.630
You're here nights only.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.897
And you're here
four days a week.

06:14.897 --> 06:17.630
Well, four,
zero, zero.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.630
Lisa, Keith, you're gonna
have to help me out here.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.097
Hold on, mate.
When you're not here,
I'm here.

06:23.097 --> 06:24.864
It just--I'm just--
we're here--

06:24.864 --> 06:25.930
I'm just
a little bit confused.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.464
First of all,
it's six days a week.

06:27.464 --> 06:29.897
Now it's no days a week.
I'm just...

06:29.897 --> 06:30.000
He's scared.
Why do I gotta
lie to him?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.964
He's scared.
Why do I gotta
lie to him?

06:31.964 --> 06:33.664
You're not lying.
But I'm telling
you the truth.

06:33.664 --> 06:35.330
You just said I'm not lying,
so you need to know.

06:35.330 --> 06:36.964
But you're--
he's here to help.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.297
He needs to know
the truth.

06:39.297 --> 06:40.630
What don't you
understand?
But he is here--

06:40.630 --> 06:41.930
okay.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.764
Okay, um, the more
I get up to speed

06:44.764 --> 06:46.230
from all of you,

06:46.230 --> 06:48.064
the quicker I can look
at the scenario.

06:48.064 --> 06:50.197
I just want the truth
and nothing but the truth.

06:50.197 --> 06:52.297
That just helps me tenfold.

06:52.297 --> 06:53.664
Okay, uh, right.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.564
Where should I sit?
Where, uh--yeah?

06:55.564 --> 06:56.597
Thank you.

06:56.597 --> 06:57.964
Let's eat, yeah?

06:57.964 --> 06:59.130
Okay.

06:59.130 --> 07:00.000
Talk about throwing me
under the bus.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.564
Talk about throwing me
under the bus.

07:02.564 --> 07:04.564
I haven't even sat down,
and it  starts.

07:09.564 --> 07:10.664
Why, what happened?

07:13.430 --> 07:15.430
Wow, huge menu.

07:15.430 --> 07:17.430
Ready or...?
Uh, yes.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.964
Let's start

07:18.964 --> 07:21.397
with grandma's
pan-fried meatballs

07:21.397 --> 07:22.864
served over
a house salad...
okay.

07:22.864 --> 07:24.530
And then the salmon,
pan-roasted slowly...

07:24.530 --> 07:26.364
Okay.
And the clams.

07:26.364 --> 07:27.797
Oh, the stuffed clams.
No problem.

07:27.797 --> 07:29.297
Thank you.

07:29.297 --> 07:30.000
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.697
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you.

07:30.697 --> 07:32.064
Rick.
Rick.

07:32.064 --> 07:33.464
Nice to meet you.
And what do you do?

07:33.464 --> 07:34.364
You're the...
Bartender/server.

07:34.364 --> 07:35.497
Bartender/server.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.064
And what's wrong
with the restaurant?

07:37.064 --> 07:38.564
Um, lack of management.

07:38.564 --> 07:40.064
Lack of management.

07:40.064 --> 07:41.464
Owner's not here
very much.

07:41.464 --> 07:42.864
What are you gonna do?

07:42.864 --> 07:44.530
I have to pick
some liquor up.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.464
Can I have a quick
word with Keith, please?

07:46.464 --> 07:47.430
Yeah.
Thank you.

07:49.364 --> 07:51.197
Where's Keith?

07:51.197 --> 07:52.264
He left.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.564
Go get him.
Hurry up.

07:55.830 --> 07:57.763
What a surprise.

07:57.763 --> 07:58.863
Oh, he left.

07:58.863 --> 08:00.000
Keith is not here
on a regular basis.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.863
Keith is not here
on a regular basis.

08:00.863 --> 08:02.263
Gordon wanted
to talk to Keith.

08:02.263 --> 08:03.963
Where is he?
He left.

08:03.963 --> 08:05.963
I could go two or three days
without seeing Keith.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.897
He doesn't have the concept
of priorities

08:07.897 --> 08:10.030
of what needs to be done
to make this restaurant work.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.697
Why don't you go over there
and say he had to leave--

08:11.697 --> 08:13.597
go over on his behalf
and say he had to leave

08:13.597 --> 08:15.063
to get some products
for the restaurant.

08:15.063 --> 08:16.397
He should have
did that earlier.

08:16.397 --> 08:19.063
Excuse me, Gordon.
Um, Keith left.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.163
He had to go run,
um, up to the store

08:21.163 --> 08:22.763
to get--pick up
our liquor order.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.163
Oh.
He didn't know
that you wanted to see him.

08:24.163 --> 08:26.197
Is he fed up with this?
He's fed up
with everything.

08:26.197 --> 08:28.130
So when he comes in
and he sees one thing wrong,

08:28.130 --> 08:29.330
he gets all twisted,

08:29.330 --> 08:30.000
and he jumps in the car,
and he leaves.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.430
and he jumps in the car,
and he leaves.

08:30.430 --> 08:32.430
Thank you, Lisa.

08:32.430 --> 08:33.697
Hmm.

08:33.697 --> 08:36.163
A meatball salad,
a stuffed clam.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.563
Those are  nothin'.

08:37.563 --> 08:38.897
As fast
as you can, Michael.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.530
I was a server
at Cafe Tavolini.

08:43.530 --> 08:45.297
I recently moved
into the kitchen...

08:45.297 --> 08:47.463
Make sure you get
cheese on there, please.

08:47.463 --> 08:49.230
Which was, uh,
lagging quite a bit.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.697
Oh..

08:51.697 --> 08:52.897
Meatball salad.
Meatball salad.

08:52.897 --> 08:54.197
Fresh ground pepper?
Uh, no, I'm fine.

08:54.197 --> 08:56.563
Thank you.
Grandma's meatballs.

08:56.563 --> 08:57.830
Look at that.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.363
Right now, that's an insult
to grandmothers.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.263
That's a mess.

09:08.263 --> 09:09.663
Gross.

09:09.663 --> 09:10.830
How is it?

09:10.830 --> 09:13.963
Big, soggy,
dirty pool of juice

09:13.963 --> 09:16.363
and crap underneath there--
dreadful.

09:16.363 --> 09:18.097
Thank you.

09:20.763 --> 09:22.363
What'd he say
about the meatballs?

09:22.363 --> 09:23.663
He said that it was--

09:23.663 --> 09:25.963
it was dreadful,
that it was swimming in sauce.

09:25.963 --> 09:27.430
Ugh.
That was eerie.

09:27.430 --> 09:29.030
What's happening?

09:29.030 --> 09:30.000
I don't know.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.330
I don't know.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.330
Did he like
the meatballs?

09:31.330 --> 09:32.363
He said that that
meatballs'

09:32.363 --> 09:33.930
horrible,
crumbled.

09:37.030 --> 09:38.630
Wanna put 'em in the oven
or microwave 'em?

09:45.030 --> 09:46.597
Ay-yi-yi.

09:46.597 --> 09:48.563
Stuffed clams--the come
out of the microwave?

09:48.563 --> 09:49.530
Yeah.

09:53.197 --> 09:54.830
What's that?
Stuffed clams.

09:54.830 --> 09:55.963
Stuffed clams.
Thank you.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.797
Look at the size of them.

09:58.797 --> 10:00.000
It looks like some dog
in my shell.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.297
It looks like some dog
in my shell.

10:02.230 --> 10:03.997
Where's the clam?

10:03.997 --> 10:05.497
Oh, no.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.697
How's the stuffed clams?

10:07.697 --> 10:10.030
But where's the clam?

10:10.030 --> 10:11.563
It's gotta be
mixed in there, no?

10:11.563 --> 10:14.197
It's mush,
but where are the clams?

10:14.197 --> 10:16.097
I don't see it either.

10:16.097 --> 10:18.330
Taste that, please.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.097
I was, like, a little
scared to eat off his plate,

10:20.097 --> 10:22.197
because I thought he was
gonna stab me with the fork

10:22.197 --> 10:24.363
if I, like,
told him it was good.

10:24.363 --> 10:25.963
I just taste
bread crumbs.

10:25.963 --> 10:27.263
Has that been microwaved?

10:27.263 --> 10:29.230
I mean, it tastes like
a stuffing that you'd

10:29.230 --> 10:30.000
stick in the  end
of a turkey.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.530
stick in the  end
of a turkey.

10:31.530 --> 10:34.497
I'll take it
out of your way.

10:34.497 --> 10:36.397
My God.

10:36.397 --> 10:38.297
He said that there's
no clams in this.

10:38.297 --> 10:41.997
He said that this tastes
like a stuffing out of a turkey.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.597
Those stuffed clams
are garbage anyway.

10:43.597 --> 10:45.063
Keith, he hates our food.

10:45.063 --> 10:47.263
He said that the stuffing
in the stuffed clams

10:47.263 --> 10:48.797
tasted like it should be

10:48.797 --> 10:51.663
from like the
of a turkey or something.

10:51.663 --> 10:53.863
Don't you dare blame me
for anything like that, okay?

10:53.863 --> 10:55.563
Can I have that salmon?
Coming right now.

10:55.563 --> 10:58.597
Taste of Italy?
No.

10:58.597 --> 11:00.000
Certainly not
in the kitchens.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.397
Certainly not
in the kitchens.

11:00.397 --> 11:02.630
Maybe a taste
of the Italian sewers.

11:02.630 --> 11:03.797
Okay, here we go.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.530
Um, I always get nervous

11:05.530 --> 11:07.163
when the chefs start decorating
plates with parsley.

11:11.897 --> 11:13.297
Oops.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.963
Undercooked salmon that's
stone-cold in the middle.

11:18.830 --> 11:20.230
Mush.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.563
Van, do this.

11:21.563 --> 11:23.663
Taste the--
the rice for me.

11:26.030 --> 11:29.697
So you got...
insipid...gluten.

11:29.697 --> 11:30.000
When was that made?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.197
When was that made?

11:31.197 --> 11:32.697
I think they made that
yesterday.

11:32.697 --> 11:34.897
Ohh..
Yesterday?

11:34.897 --> 11:36.730
Yeah.
How much is that?

11:36.730 --> 11:39.130
21.
$21.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.030
So that's a taste
of Italian leftovers

11:41.030 --> 11:42.630
for $21.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.997
Ohh.
Want anything else?

11:43.997 --> 11:44.997
Uh...

11:44.997 --> 11:48.097
A sick bag maybe

11:48.097 --> 11:49.263
thank you.

11:49.263 --> 11:51.097
Holy.

11:57.897 --> 11:59.530
Why?
Why?

11:59.530 --> 12:00.000
We're about to get
reamed right now.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.630
We're about to get
reamed right now.

12:02.630 --> 12:05.063
He said--he hates every
single thing on the menu.

12:05.063 --> 12:07.297
He hates everything
that he ate.

12:07.297 --> 12:10.130
He said everything is totally,
totally disgusting.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.497
You're here at 4:30.
You don't know what I do.

12:22.497 --> 12:23.530
Watch yourself, bro.

12:25.930 --> 12:27.463
You're basically
just making yourself

12:27.463 --> 12:29.797
look like a bigger jackass
when you lie about things,

12:29.797 --> 12:30.000
so why don't you
just come clean?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.597
so why don't you
just come clean?

12:31.597 --> 12:33.430
He's obviously here
to help you.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.030
So let Gordon help you.

12:35.030 --> 12:37.963
You have no clue what I do,
except when I get here.

12:37.963 --> 12:39.397
You're right.
You're right.

12:39.397 --> 12:40.830
Before you found out
he was coming here,

12:40.830 --> 12:42.830
who closed your restaurant
every night?

12:44.663 --> 12:45.863
Stop--stop what?

12:47.563 --> 12:48.630
What's going on
back there?

12:48.630 --> 12:50.096
He's here to help us!

12:51.330 --> 12:52.763
Somebody call the police?

12:52.763 --> 12:54.196
What? Why am I lying?

12:54.196 --> 12:55.830
I don't understand
how I'm lying.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.630
I'm being honest that you're
never at your restaurant.

12:57.630 --> 12:58.863
Your son, not mine.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.730
Keith, I'm leaving.

13:04.730 --> 13:05.630
Yes, I am.
I'm leaving right now.

13:05.630 --> 13:07.163
Shut up!

13:17.354 --> 13:19.588
During Chef Ramsay's
dismal first meal

13:19.588 --> 13:21.154
at Cafe Tavolini...

13:21.154 --> 13:22.888
Looks like some dog
in my shell.

13:22.888 --> 13:25.754
The tension between
owner Keith and stepson Van...

13:25.754 --> 13:27.287
Before you found out
he was coming here,

13:27.287 --> 13:28.821
who closed your restaurant
every night?

13:28.821 --> 13:29.920
Stop it!

13:29.920 --> 13:31.687
Has erupted into a battle.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.687
Keith, I'm leaving.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.120
And wife and mother Lisa
is caught in the crossfire.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.287
I'm leaving right now.

13:37.287 --> 13:38.720
Shut up!

13:38.720 --> 13:41.020
What's going on back there?

13:41.020 --> 13:42.987
I'm gonna walk out,
and I'm gonna leave.

13:42.987 --> 13:43.426
- You're not leaving.
- Don't say another word.

13:43.426 --> 13:44.520
- You're not leaving.
- Don't say another word.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.787
Then you don't say
another word, then.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.320
What's going on?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.854
He gets mad because I'm
trying to tell him the truth,

13:48.854 --> 13:50.954
and he's making me try to look
like an idiot in front of you.

13:54.554 --> 13:55.554
You okay?

13:55.554 --> 13:56.654
Yes, sir.

13:56.654 --> 13:57.787
What's going on?

13:57.787 --> 13:59.454
Oh, no, just a little
confrontation.

13:59.454 --> 14:02.254
Why are you lying?
He's here to help us!

14:02.254 --> 14:03.554
He's not here
because the owners

14:03.554 --> 14:05.354
Run everything perfectly.

14:05.354 --> 14:07.087
And this is why he's here, and
this is what needs to change.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.254
And I can't take it.

14:10.887 --> 14:12.987
Hey, come on.
Don't get upset.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.354
Ohh.

14:16.354 --> 14:17.654
What's the matter?

14:19.520 --> 14:20.854
I just--it's just--

14:20.854 --> 14:24.254
it's just the same stuff
that just constantly goes on.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.187
This business
has affected my marriage,

14:26.187 --> 14:28.054
totally has affected
my family.

14:28.054 --> 14:30.154
I'm totally, like,
beside myself.

14:30.154 --> 14:31.820
You okay?
I'm sorry
about that.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.920
Don't apologize Tome.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.554
No, I already
apologized to her.
That's your lady.

14:35.554 --> 14:37.587
And I thought,
up until now,

14:37.587 --> 14:39.020
the food was
the biggest problem.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.420
Let me tell you,
the menu...

14:40.420 --> 14:42.554
Was a  disgrace.

14:42.554 --> 14:43.426
Hideous.

14:43.426 --> 14:43.887
Hideous.

14:43.887 --> 14:45.787
I-I gotta--I definitely
apologize for that.

14:45.787 --> 14:48.387
Okay, I need, uh...
I need a break.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.154
I'll be back later.

14:52.820 --> 14:54.887
I'm surprised
he's even gonna stay here

14:54.887 --> 14:56.087
and even deal with us.

14:56.087 --> 14:58.087
He's gonna think
we're all crazy.

14:59.554 --> 15:01.887
With a restaurant
and a marriage

15:01.887 --> 15:03.087
clearly on the line...

15:03.087 --> 15:04.587
Lisa, let's do a little
quick catch-up.

15:04.587 --> 15:05.720
Just me and you?

15:05.720 --> 15:06.954
Yeah, just you
and I, yeah.

15:06.954 --> 15:08.187
Chef Ramsay knows

15:08.187 --> 15:09.354
He needs to dive in quickly

15:09.354 --> 15:10.920
and gather
as much information

15:10.920 --> 15:13.426
about the financials
of Cafe Tavolini.

15:13.426 --> 15:13.687
about the financials
of Cafe Tavolini.

15:13.687 --> 15:14.887
Help me to get

15:14.887 --> 15:18.220
up to speed
with where we are in business.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.520
The money
is not coming in.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.287
I mean, the numbers
are disgusting.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.587
We had a night
a couple weeks ago...

15:23.587 --> 15:25.720
There was $40 in the till.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.187
$40?

15:27.187 --> 15:28.220
Wow.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.054
Our house was foreclosed on.

15:31.054 --> 15:33.554
Because of the business?
Yeah.

15:33.554 --> 15:35.054
So we've just
been declining

15:35.054 --> 15:36.154
and just failing.

15:36.154 --> 15:37.520
We can't even
take a salary, we could--

15:37.520 --> 15:38.820
Keith walks around--
seriously,

15:38.820 --> 15:40.054
that's why
he's so stressed out--

15:40.054 --> 15:41.387
he doesn't even have
a dollar in his pocket.

15:41.387 --> 15:42.587
And then as soon
as he gets here,

15:42.587 --> 15:43.426
he'll see one thing
that aggravates him,

15:43.426 --> 15:44.320
he'll see one thing
that aggravates him,

15:44.320 --> 15:45.820
and that's when it starts.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.120
And this is because
the cash has dried up?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.187
Yep.

15:48.187 --> 15:49.687
How do you get
through the day?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.454
I mean,.
I don't-- I'm so depressed.

15:51.454 --> 15:52.854
Some days,
I just want

15:52.854 --> 15:55.287
to hand him divorce papers,
because I can't take it.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.187
If the restaurant closes,

15:58.187 --> 16:00.920
I can't see our marriage
continuing.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.120
You know, it just makes it
so difficult.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.654
I mean, I hope
you can help us,

16:05.654 --> 16:07.987
but is it
too overwhelming?

16:09.387 --> 16:10.587
Let me have a look.

16:10.587 --> 16:13.420
I need to see everything
in action tonight, okay?

16:13.420 --> 16:13.426
Okay.

16:13.426 --> 16:15.220
Okay.

16:17.587 --> 16:19.220
After a day filled
with arguments...

16:19.220 --> 16:20.520
Shut up!

16:20.520 --> 16:22.987
Tears and accusations...

16:22.987 --> 16:25.154
You're never
at your restaurant.

16:25.154 --> 16:27.987
Chef Ramsay is back
to observe a dinner service.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.720
The kitchen's small.
It's a box.

16:30.720 --> 16:34.254
You cook 70-odd items
on the menu from this?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.354
Yeah.

16:35.354 --> 16:37.254
Joe, you're stuck
in the corner?

16:37.254 --> 16:38.454
I don't know.

16:38.454 --> 16:39.654
No, I'm serious.
I know, I...

16:39.654 --> 16:41.754
It's--it's ridiculous.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.420
Hello.
Hi. How are you?

16:43.420 --> 16:43.426
News of Chef Ramsay's
appearance in Connecticut

16:43.426 --> 16:45.987
News of Chef Ramsay's
appearance in Connecticut

16:45.987 --> 16:47.754
results
in a full restaurant.

16:47.754 --> 16:49.420
Right this way,
okay, guys?

16:49.420 --> 16:52.054
And while customers look
to satisfy their appetite...

16:52.054 --> 16:53.387
Lobster ravioli.
Sure.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.587
Veal caprice.

16:54.587 --> 16:56.354
They aren't the only ones.

16:56.354 --> 16:57.487
Can you order me
a dinner?

16:57.487 --> 16:59.454
No, I can't do that
right now.

16:59.454 --> 17:01.987
I need a minute.
Okay.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.520
When you get a minute,
can you order me a, um--

17:04.520 --> 17:07.087
No, don't talk to me
right now.

17:07.087 --> 17:08.154
That's not the way it works.

17:08.154 --> 17:09.387
I'm putting my orders in,

17:09.387 --> 17:10.487
making sure
the customer's happy.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.887
Now she wants to eat.

17:11.887 --> 17:13.354
I can't--
I can't eat now.

17:13.354 --> 17:13.426
Who? Who wants to--
Lisa wants me
to order dinner.

17:13.426 --> 17:15.087
Who? Who wants to--
Lisa wants me
to order dinner.

17:15.087 --> 17:16.954
Lisa just doesn't get it.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.820
While owner Lisa has to wait
to place her order...

17:19.820 --> 17:21.420
I am starving.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.787
Customers in the dining room...

17:24.387 --> 17:26.154
Oh, my goodness.

17:26.154 --> 17:27.854
Are quickly
receiving their food.

17:27.854 --> 17:29.054
Oh, hey.

17:29.054 --> 17:31.320
Maybe a little too quickly.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.554
And Chef Ramsay
wants to know why.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.620
Did you just--
did you--

17:34.620 --> 17:35.854
did you just pull that
out of the fridge?

17:35.854 --> 17:36.887
Yes, chef.

17:36.887 --> 17:38.187
What is that?

17:38.187 --> 17:40.054
It's chicken.

17:40.054 --> 17:41.620
And why are you cooking it
in adVance?

17:41.620 --> 17:43.426
'Cause of space.
'cause of space, time.

17:43.426 --> 17:43.754
'Cause of space.
'cause of space, time.

17:43.754 --> 17:46.520
- Just touch that.
- It's.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.287
How many portions you got
in there cooked ahead?

17:48.287 --> 17:51.087
Show me the tray,
please.

17:51.087 --> 17:53.887
That's dryer than
the Nevada desert.

17:53.887 --> 17:55.454
These look like they
were cooked yesterday.

17:58.654 --> 18:01.087
I mean,
they're  solid.

18:01.087 --> 18:02.487
Huh?

18:02.487 --> 18:03.987
I mean...

18:06.020 --> 18:08.054
I mean, I wouldn't even
hang that on a Christmas tree.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.354
That chicken,
it's already cooked.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.854
It's gonna get cooked again.

18:10.854 --> 18:12.120
Who the  would
wanna eat this?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.287
And he's absolutely right.

18:13.287 --> 18:13.426
Lisa, Keith...

18:13.426 --> 18:14.587
Lisa, Keith...

18:14.587 --> 18:16.954
So I'm trying to get
up to speed with the chefs.

18:16.954 --> 18:17.987
Just feel that there.

18:19.187 --> 18:20.220
Solid.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.954
That's for the chicken parm.

18:21.954 --> 18:23.620
They don't make it
to order.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.554
Why not?

18:26.454 --> 18:27.887
We've always
done it that way.

18:27.887 --> 18:29.854
We really didn't know
it's a problem.

18:29.854 --> 18:32.320
That's just--
I mean, that's insane.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.654
This sucks.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.254
Despite a fast start...

18:35.254 --> 18:36.387
How's your meal?

18:36.387 --> 18:37.754
We haven't had any yet.

18:37.754 --> 18:39.654
We're waiting,
and it's very long.

18:39.654 --> 18:41.320
The disorganized kitchen

18:41.320 --> 18:43.426
is now delivering food
at a snail's pace.

18:43.426 --> 18:44.154
is now delivering food
at a snail's pace.

18:44.154 --> 18:45.620
I'm waiting
on a cheese ravioli.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.787
It's getting hot.
Just give it a second.

18:46.787 --> 18:48.354
Bro, come on, dude!

18:48.354 --> 18:49.820
It'll be
right there, bro.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.454
I'm waiting on 13 and 11.

18:52.454 --> 18:54.220
I've never seen

18:54.220 --> 18:57.287
Such a dysfunctional kitchen
in all my  life.

18:57.287 --> 18:59.020
Chris squashed
down in the corner.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.387
The chicken reheated.

19:00.387 --> 19:02.354
All these plates
have got chips on them.

19:02.354 --> 19:03.954
What's all those tickets
on the floor?

19:03.954 --> 19:06.187
It's just madness--
I mean, absolute madness.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.220
Where's Lisa?
Where's Keith?

19:13.420 --> 19:13.426
Serious?

19:13.426 --> 19:14.754
Serious?

19:16.954 --> 19:17.954
People haven't
gotten their meals

19:17.954 --> 19:19.420
in over 45 minutes.

19:19.420 --> 19:21.320
The kitchen is just
a whole mess.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.720
And my mother and Keith
were nowhere to be found.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.354
Is mommy and Keith somewhere?

19:27.354 --> 19:29.287
They sit in the car
for no reason.

19:29.287 --> 19:31.754
Keith and my mother
are sitting out in the driveway

19:31.754 --> 19:33.487
on a crazy, crazy night.

19:34.854 --> 19:36.420
We can't handle this.
We need help.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.454
Well, you know what?

19:37.454 --> 19:38.787
Maybe they should come
and worry

19:38.787 --> 19:40.354
about the problems that are
really happening right now.

19:40.354 --> 19:41.520
Yeah, like how, um--

19:41.520 --> 19:43.087
that the kitchen's
a disaster.

19:43.087 --> 19:43.426
The parm, pick it up.

19:43.426 --> 19:44.220
The parm, pick it up.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.320
My mother order this?

19:45.320 --> 19:47.187
She's gonna sit
in the car and eat it?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.254
Is this normal
when we get busy?

19:50.254 --> 19:51.787
I'm embarrassed now.

19:51.787 --> 19:54.720
Why was this ordered
under your name?

19:54.720 --> 19:55.854
Oh, it's mine.

19:55.854 --> 19:56.987
You're gonna
eat it out here?

19:56.987 --> 19:58.587
What am I gonna eat it
with, my fingers?

19:58.587 --> 20:00.120
Here, that's
what you want.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.020
You can eat it out here.
Give me a fork.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.820
Stuffed pork chops,
primavera white,

20:04.820 --> 20:05.887
with penne.

20:05.887 --> 20:07.120
While the two owners

20:07.120 --> 20:08.387
Dine in the car...

20:08.387 --> 20:09.654
Where's my bus girl?

20:09.654 --> 20:11.220
I got farfalle.
Here's your chicken and sausage.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.987
I have 21 and 22.

20:12.987 --> 20:13.426
Michael does his best
to rally the staff

20:13.426 --> 20:15.154
Michael does his best
to rally the staff

20:15.154 --> 20:17.054
And complete dinner service.

20:17.054 --> 20:19.187
Spaghetti and meatball.

20:19.187 --> 20:22.587
Let's get
out of here, boys.

20:24.954 --> 20:27.087
Okay, I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

20:27.087 --> 20:28.420
You two...

20:28.420 --> 20:29.920
Have been abusing
your restaurant.

20:33.154 --> 20:35.687
Van gets angry.

20:35.687 --> 20:37.254
Michael gets frustrated.

20:37.254 --> 20:38.820
Ricky gets upset.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.720
The owners--
I didn't see you get upset.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.220
I saw you walk outside
with your coat,

20:43.220 --> 20:43.426
and you were sat
in the car.

20:43.426 --> 20:44.854
and you were sat
in the car.

20:44.854 --> 20:48.254
It's a joke!

20:48.254 --> 20:49.220
Keith, help me!

20:49.220 --> 20:50.820
I, uh...

20:50.820 --> 20:52.087
My passion

20:52.087 --> 20:54.820
is a little, uh,
you know, down.

20:59.187 --> 21:01.254
If you got behind this bar
and you got on the floor

21:01.254 --> 21:03.887
and you did
something to show you care,

21:03.887 --> 21:05.520
people see that.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.120
Customers aren't gonna care
about your business

21:08.120 --> 21:09.987
if you don't give a
about it.

21:09.987 --> 21:12.654
And the two of you said it
on a million occasions--

21:12.654 --> 21:13.426
walk in the place,
"I don't even give a

21:13.426 --> 21:14.320
walk in the place,
"I don't even give a

21:14.320 --> 21:16.920
- about this place anymore.
- I hope it  burns."

21:16.920 --> 21:19.554
Well, you know what?
That's what it's doing--burning,

21:19.554 --> 21:21.254
right to the  ground.

21:32.807 --> 21:34.941
While Lisa's daughter, Joli,

21:34.941 --> 21:37.041
eloquently sums up
a miserable evening...

21:37.041 --> 21:38.707
Customers aren't gonna care
about your business

21:38.707 --> 21:40.807
if you don't give a
about it.

21:40.807 --> 21:43.141
And a frustrating performance
by her parents...

21:43.141 --> 21:45.241
Why was this ordered
under your name?

21:45.241 --> 21:47.141
Oh, it's mine.
You're gonna
eat it out here?

21:47.141 --> 21:48.941
Chef Ramsay realizes

21:48.941 --> 21:50.407
He has to do
something drastic,

21:50.407 --> 21:51.841
so the following day...

21:51.841 --> 21:52.941
Oh, my God.

21:52.941 --> 21:54.141
Look at the restaurant.

21:54.141 --> 21:55.841
He gives Keith and Lisa

21:55.841 --> 21:57.386
A dose of shock therapy.

21:57.386 --> 21:57.707
A dose of shock therapy.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.241
What the...What is that?

22:02.807 --> 22:04.641
"Out of business, closed,"

22:04.641 --> 22:06.541
plastered against the whole side
of the building.

22:06.541 --> 22:09.307
And, uh, I just
can't believe it.

22:09.307 --> 22:10.807
What does this mean?

22:10.807 --> 22:13.207
We can't even get in.

22:16.241 --> 22:17.974
What's going on?

22:17.974 --> 22:20.174
Well, I wish I could say
good morning,

22:20.174 --> 22:22.441
'cause it's not
a good morning.

22:22.441 --> 22:26.307
Don't bother crossing the line.

22:26.307 --> 22:27.386
You're shut down.

22:27.386 --> 22:28.141
You're shut down.

22:28.141 --> 22:30.707
You're out of business.

22:34.007 --> 22:36.407
- Keith...
- It's  up.

22:36.407 --> 22:38.641
I mean, I just--
this is not what I wanted.

22:38.641 --> 22:41.607
There's too much money
invested in this place.

22:41.607 --> 22:43.541
This is not good.

22:43.541 --> 22:46.507
I wrote you a letter
last night.

22:46.507 --> 22:49.407
Can you read it?

22:49.407 --> 22:51.341
"Dear Gordon,

22:51.341 --> 22:53.107
"I want you to know
that you have touched home

22:53.107 --> 22:56.107
"with your perception
of Keith and I.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.386
"We are guilty of negligence

22:57.386 --> 22:57.941
"We are guilty of negligence

22:57.941 --> 23:01.274
"and irresponsibility
on our part.

23:01.274 --> 23:03.441
"Keith and I
have let our staff

23:03.441 --> 23:05.074
"and customers down
due to a lack

23:05.074 --> 23:07.441
"of our participation
at the restaurant.

23:07.441 --> 23:09.607
"Keith and I were oblivious
to so much

23:09.607 --> 23:12.407
"before you spoke
to us tonight.

23:12.407 --> 23:14.207
We were in denial."

23:16.441 --> 23:21.274
"We were in denial
of all of our faults.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.441
"Our plea to you is not
to give up hope on us.

23:24.441 --> 23:26.274
"Keith and I
are willing to make

23:26.274 --> 23:27.386
"drastic changes in our lives
to save our restaurant.

23:27.386 --> 23:29.107
"drastic changes in our lives
to save our restaurant.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.141
"Unfortunately,
we need the guidance

23:31.141 --> 23:34.641
to be able to turn this place
around for the best."

23:36.174 --> 23:38.707
"You have our full commitment
from Keith and I

23:38.707 --> 23:40.874
"that we will work
as hard as we can

23:40.874 --> 23:44.141
"to make the changes.

23:44.141 --> 23:46.474
"I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart

23:46.474 --> 23:48.207
"for coming to Cafe Tavolini

23:48.207 --> 23:50.141
and opening up our eyes."

23:51.507 --> 23:55.574
This is exactly
what I needed to hear.

23:55.574 --> 23:57.386
I'm not giving up.

23:57.386 --> 23:58.207
I'm not giving up.

23:58.207 --> 23:59.907
This is a wake-up call.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.907
You're not closed today.

24:02.907 --> 24:05.441
But this will be the result
if we don't start now,

24:05.441 --> 24:07.841
and I mean now.

24:09.941 --> 24:12.774
Today we start
the comeback.

24:12.774 --> 24:14.474
And I need both of you
to be committed.

24:14.474 --> 24:17.374
Okay.
I hear you.
I hear you loud and clear.

24:17.374 --> 24:18.707
Let's get inside.

24:22.941 --> 24:25.707
Owners Keith and Lisa
have convinced Chef Ramsay

24:25.707 --> 24:27.386
That they are now committed
to the restaurant.

24:27.386 --> 24:27.807
That they are now committed
to the restaurant.

24:27.807 --> 24:30.207
But Chef Ramsay
is not the only one

24:30.207 --> 24:31.607
that needs convincing.

24:31.607 --> 24:33.407
Keith and Lisa...

24:33.407 --> 24:35.607
Address your team.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.574
I just wanted to apologize
to the staff

24:37.574 --> 24:39.607
for our negligence,

24:39.607 --> 24:41.241
giving up on something

24:41.241 --> 24:43.507
which I know is everybody's
livelihood here.

24:43.507 --> 24:45.007
I love you guys
for being here.

24:45.007 --> 24:46.141
You've been with us
since day one.

24:46.141 --> 24:48.507
And if you really
didn't care about us,

24:48.507 --> 24:51.341
you would never be here.

24:51.341 --> 24:52.574
And I really appreciate it,

24:52.574 --> 24:54.641
And I do want to get it
to a better point.

24:57.441 --> 25:00.007
If it wasn't for you guys,
I don't know what I would do,

25:00.007 --> 25:02.941
'cause you guys really are
a great staff,

25:02.941 --> 25:05.141
and you really
have stuck by us.

25:05.141 --> 25:07.407
And it's our fault,
because we just--

25:07.407 --> 25:08.707
just gave up,

25:08.707 --> 25:11.341
because we just couldn't handle
the pressure.

25:14.641 --> 25:16.141
I realize
that I need to be

25:16.141 --> 25:18.141
more hands-on.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.374
It's gonna be
a personal goal of mine

25:20.374 --> 25:22.241
to, you know, work at it.

25:22.241 --> 25:23.774
I think Keith and my mom

25:23.774 --> 25:27.307
are definitely, uh, sincere
about what's going on.

25:27.307 --> 25:27.386
I think it's definitely
an eye-opener for them.

25:27.386 --> 25:29.707
I think it's definitely
an eye-opener for them.

25:29.707 --> 25:31.807
Everything here
in the last five years

25:31.807 --> 25:33.207
has been negative.

25:33.207 --> 25:35.940
So it was definitely
a breath of fresh air.

25:41.341 --> 25:42.574
For tonight's dinner service,

25:42.574 --> 25:45.008
Chef Ramsay institutes
some major changes.

25:45.008 --> 25:46.908
We have to stand out
from the competition.

25:46.908 --> 25:49.041
So we need to do something
that no one else is doing.

25:49.041 --> 25:52.474
A family-style menu that
features a Tuscan bean soup,

25:52.474 --> 25:54.308
Porchetta
with roasted vegetables,

25:54.308 --> 25:56.108
and olive-oil cake.

25:56.108 --> 25:57.386
A menu family style has to show
convenience for the kitchen,

25:57.386 --> 25:58.774
A menu family style has to show
convenience for the kitchen,

25:58.774 --> 26:01.241
And the customers
will help themselves.

26:01.241 --> 26:03.208
Service becomes
a lot more efficient.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.908
And the kitchen
gets out of the weeds.

26:05.908 --> 26:07.474
It is a very small kitchen.

26:07.474 --> 26:10.174
Family-style dining should help
that kitchen run more smoothly.

26:10.174 --> 26:11.808
And for the first time...

26:11.808 --> 26:14.441
The two owners are hands-on
and working tonight!

26:14.441 --> 26:17.308
Owners Keith and Lisa
will have active roles

26:17.308 --> 26:19.141
In their restaurant.

26:19.141 --> 26:20.708
Lisa, you're gonna roll
your sleeves up tonight.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.208
You're serving.
There you go.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.741
But I haven't been
a server before.

26:24.741 --> 26:27.386
You are gonna be
a server tonight.

26:27.386 --> 26:27.774
You are gonna be
a server tonight.

26:27.774 --> 26:29.508
Keith!

26:29.508 --> 26:30.674
I want you physically
on the floor.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.541
What are you good at doing?

26:32.541 --> 26:34.708
I could make up a cocktail,
and I could promote it.

26:34.708 --> 26:35.874
Good.
I like that.

26:35.874 --> 26:37.074
I've never served before,

26:37.074 --> 26:38.708
And it's gonna be
a little bit scary.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.441
I didn't see that
coming at all.

26:40.441 --> 26:41.774
Okay, let's go.
We're opening in eight minutes.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.208
Yeah, let's go!

26:43.208 --> 26:44.441
Coming up...

26:44.441 --> 26:45.974
Table 21, please.

26:45.974 --> 26:47.441
It's a dinner service from hell.

26:47.441 --> 26:48.508
Where's our food?

26:48.508 --> 26:50.274
Get a  grip.

26:50.274 --> 26:52.574
Keith and Lisa may be
finally doing some work...

26:52.574 --> 26:54.308
Would you like
another beer?

26:54.308 --> 26:55.608
But that doesn't mean
this restaurant

26:55.608 --> 26:56.708
Is truly united.

26:56.708 --> 26:57.386
Five's meal!

26:57.386 --> 26:58.241
Five's meal!

26:58.241 --> 27:00.808
Can Tavolini rebound
and recover?

27:00.808 --> 27:03.808
Keith, get behind the line
and get them together!

27:03.808 --> 27:05.774
Or is it simply a lost cause?

27:05.774 --> 27:07.341
Close that door!

27:09.108 --> 27:11.108
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

27:16.187 --> 27:17.653
There's definitely a new energy

27:17.653 --> 27:18.820
in the restaurant tonight.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.853
When I order it
in the computer,

27:20.853 --> 27:22.753
am I hitting two--
that means a party of two?

27:22.753 --> 27:24.520
Go over there,
and I'll show you real quick.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.120
And both owners
are optimistic...

27:26.120 --> 27:27.853
What are you gonna do?

27:27.853 --> 27:30.153
Uh, pomegranate Bellini.
That sounds amazing.

27:30.153 --> 27:31.820
And so is Chef Ramsay.

27:31.820 --> 27:34.087
A pomegranate bellini.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.753
I don't know what's
in store for tonight,

27:35.753 --> 27:37.220
but I know that I'm definitely
gonna hit up

27:37.220 --> 27:38.453
the  church
down the road and pray

27:38.453 --> 27:40.587
before I go on the floor.

27:43.020 --> 27:43.398
We're offering
a family style tonight.

27:43.398 --> 27:44.587
We're offering
a family style tonight.

27:44.587 --> 27:46.720
You guys make a decision.
And I'll be back in a few.
Thank you.

27:49.220 --> 27:51.820
Pomegranate Bellini would be
our special dinner drink.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.820
We should get
a round of those.

27:53.820 --> 27:56.553
Keith has wanted
an active role.

27:56.553 --> 27:58.087
I just don't think
he actually knew

27:58.087 --> 27:59.420
that he was able to do that.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.153
Is this your creation?
This is delicious.

28:01.153 --> 28:02.320
Oh, good.
Thank you.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.687
Eight in a flash.

28:03.687 --> 28:04.853
Eight what?
Eight bellinis.

28:04.853 --> 28:05.920
Okay, good.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.687
Lisa, service.

28:07.687 --> 28:08.787
All right.

28:08.787 --> 28:09.987
Yeah, that looks good.

28:09.987 --> 28:11.653
Would you like
another beer?

28:11.653 --> 28:12.553
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

28:12.553 --> 28:13.398
I'm so proud of you.

28:13.398 --> 28:13.720
I'm so proud of you.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.587
You're doing
such a nice job, Lisa.

28:15.587 --> 28:17.420
Being a server,
it actually felt good.

28:18.753 --> 28:20.120
Doesn't it smell delicious?

28:20.120 --> 28:22.120
Would you like some
fresh, uh, pepper?
Yeah.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.253
To hear firsthand comments
about the food,

28:24.253 --> 28:25.353
It was exciting.

28:25.353 --> 28:27.220
It's so nice to see you
being involved.

28:27.220 --> 28:28.753
It brings you closer,

28:28.753 --> 28:31.220
not just to the customers,
but to your team.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.887
With the owners and staff
hard at work...

28:33.887 --> 28:36.120
Van, table 12.
Here we go.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.220
The service is off
to a good start.

28:39.753 --> 28:42.687
And the diners love
the family-style specials.

28:42.687 --> 28:43.398
These are awesome.

28:43.398 --> 28:44.653
These are awesome.

28:44.653 --> 28:45.920
But the customers who ordered

28:45.920 --> 28:47.087
From the regular menu...

28:48.753 --> 28:51.220
Are having a completely
different experience.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.487
Where's our food?

28:52.487 --> 28:53.687
Did you go family style,

28:53.687 --> 28:54.720
or did you go
off the menu?

28:54.720 --> 28:57.353
Should we have
gone family style?

28:57.353 --> 29:01.153
Family style, it seems to be
coming out faster.

29:01.153 --> 29:03.120
Everybody okay?
Your tables are good?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.420
No, they're
not all right.

29:08.020 --> 29:10.020
Michael, I'm waiting on 32.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.020
Can I get table 21,
please?

29:12.020 --> 29:13.398
They've been waiting
for an hour and a half.

29:13.398 --> 29:13.420
They've been waiting
for an hour and a half.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.453
I'm waiting,
I'm waiting.

29:15.453 --> 29:18.553
Right now I'm waiting
on a flight out of here.

29:18.553 --> 29:19.820
Let's complete
the  table

29:19.820 --> 29:21.087
And see if we can get
our  together.

29:21.087 --> 29:22.453
Look at all those tickets.

29:22.453 --> 29:23.687
God almighty.

29:23.687 --> 29:24.853
This is crazy.

29:24.853 --> 29:26.853
Everybody, come here!
Come here, you.

29:26.853 --> 29:28.920
Come here.

29:28.920 --> 29:32.853
You guys have to seriously
get a  grip.

29:32.853 --> 29:34.787
And, Lisa, Keith...
Yeah?

29:34.787 --> 29:37.387
You can't run a restaurant
with a 70-item menu

29:37.387 --> 29:39.520
from this kitchen.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.853
If I was the owner,
I would want to look

29:49.853 --> 29:52.387
after every single person
that hasn't gotten their meal.

29:52.387 --> 29:53.653
Say, "Hey, can I get
you guys a dessert?

29:53.653 --> 29:55.487
Can I get you guys a drink?
I'm sorry."

29:55.487 --> 29:57.787
My mother was just walking
around aimlessly,

29:57.787 --> 29:59.287
and Keith
wasn't doing anything.

29:59.287 --> 30:03.287
They just really showed
no ownership skills tonight.

30:03.287 --> 30:05.153
Look at Keith,
slopping like that.

30:05.153 --> 30:06.487
Look, look, look, look.

30:06.487 --> 30:07.920
I mean,  honestly.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.620
What's the matter with him?

30:13.853 --> 30:15.187
Sorry, guys.
I know it's hectic,

30:15.187 --> 30:17.120
but I'm just gonna be
right back in.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.653
It's a nightmare.

30:18.653 --> 30:20.353
I didn't know what to do.

30:20.353 --> 30:22.287
I was just too embarrassed
to even go up to any tables

30:22.287 --> 30:23.587
and to apologize.

30:23.587 --> 30:26.320
I just kind of zoned out
and couldn't do anything.

30:30.053 --> 30:32.287
Where's Keith? He's not out at
the liquor store for a hot dog.

30:32.287 --> 30:34.253
Where is he?

30:34.253 --> 30:36.353
While Keith and Lisa fail
to tackle tonight's problems...

30:36.353 --> 30:38.520
Ricky needs a meatball platter
for four--I need it now!

30:38.520 --> 30:40.353
A leader has emerged
in the kitchen.

30:40.353 --> 30:42.187
You got it.

30:42.187 --> 30:43.398
Michael steps up and does
his best to push orders out.

30:43.398 --> 30:45.120
Michael steps up and does
his best to push orders out.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.487
Spaghetti and meatballs,
Chris.

30:46.487 --> 30:47.520
Thank you.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.020
Spaghetti and meatballs.
Take it.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.287
After that's, what next?
Come on.

30:50.287 --> 30:51.987
The stuffed pork chop,
a chicken parm,

30:51.987 --> 30:53.320
mediterraneo,
and a meatball platter,

30:53.320 --> 30:55.853
porchetta, meatballs...

30:55.853 --> 30:58.153
And as a result,
the remaining ala carte orders

30:58.153 --> 31:00.153
Start hitting the tables.

31:00.153 --> 31:01.387
This is your
final table here.

31:01.387 --> 31:04.687
Fettuccine mediterraneo.

31:04.687 --> 31:06.287
Thanks for comin'.
Come back and see us.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.387
Okay.

31:12.387 --> 31:13.398
First, let me start
with the positive.

31:13.398 --> 31:14.487
First, let me start
with the positive.

31:14.487 --> 31:17.520
The family-style menu
came out quicker,

31:17.520 --> 31:19.387
and it satisfied
the customers.

31:19.387 --> 31:21.787
Considering the size
of the kitchen,

31:21.787 --> 31:23.653
it's clearly the direction
this restaurant

31:23.653 --> 31:25.887
needs to start
moving towards.

31:25.887 --> 31:28.053
But we have
a long way to go.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.087
Lisa...

31:29.087 --> 31:31.220
Keith.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.353
Joli...

31:32.353 --> 31:35.320
Describe
Keith's performance tonight.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.553
I thought, in the beginning,

31:36.553 --> 31:38.787
Keith had a lot
of, uh, good energy.

31:38.787 --> 31:41.353
I do have to say,
when  hit the fan,

31:41.353 --> 31:43.398
You kind of disappeared.

31:43.398 --> 31:44.587
You kind of disappeared.

31:44.587 --> 31:46.353
Keith, please.

31:46.353 --> 31:48.553
That stuff--
that should not happen.

31:48.553 --> 31:50.253
Oh, God.

31:50.253 --> 31:52.620
Keith, you've got
to understand...

31:52.620 --> 31:53.887
It's your business.

31:53.887 --> 31:57.187
Never, ever feel agitated,

31:57.187 --> 31:58.553
nervous

31:58.553 --> 32:02.420
about working inside
your business!

32:02.420 --> 32:05.620
There's gonna be
a big change tomorrow.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.120
We're gonna relaunch
this restaurant.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.753
But, Lisa and Keith,

32:08.753 --> 32:12.487
relaunch yourselves.

32:12.487 --> 32:13.398
And if you're not
gonna do that,

32:13.398 --> 32:14.353
And if you're not
gonna do that,

32:14.353 --> 32:17.853
then  close that door!

32:26.122 --> 32:27.555
It may have been
a rough dinner service...

32:27.555 --> 32:29.089
Look at all those tickets.

32:29.089 --> 32:31.289
God almighty.
This is crazy.

32:31.289 --> 32:33.789
But the new commitment
of Lisa and Keith...

32:33.789 --> 32:35.355
You're doing such
a nice job, Lisa.

32:35.355 --> 32:38.022
Was just enough
to convince Chef Ramsay

32:38.022 --> 32:39.489
to go ahead with his plan

32:39.489 --> 32:42.622
of giving Tavolini
a much-needed makeover.

32:42.622 --> 32:44.822
- Good morning.
- Good morning, chef.

32:44.822 --> 32:46.222
How's everybody feeling?

32:46.222 --> 32:47.389
Nervous.

32:47.389 --> 32:49.089
Look at this.
My hand is shaking.

32:49.089 --> 32:51.189
Okay, today...

32:51.189 --> 32:53.375
We relaunch
your restaurant.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.289
We relaunch
your restaurant.

32:54.289 --> 32:55.489
On the count of three...

32:55.489 --> 32:56.889
One...

32:56.889 --> 32:57.922
Are you crying, Li?

32:57.922 --> 32:59.689
I'm already crying.

32:59.689 --> 33:01.955
Two...

33:01.955 --> 33:03.255
Oh, my God!

33:03.255 --> 33:04.789
And...

33:04.789 --> 33:05.955
Three!

33:05.955 --> 33:08.522
Wow.
Oh, my God.

33:08.522 --> 33:10.555
- Whoo-hoo!
- Amazing!

33:10.555 --> 33:11.555
It's really gorgeous.

33:11.555 --> 33:13.255
Oh, my God.

33:13.255 --> 33:15.522
Welcome to new Tavolini.

33:15.522 --> 33:16.955
Oh, my Lord.

33:16.955 --> 33:18.589
Modern...Elegant...

33:18.589 --> 33:20.322
Unbelievable.
Beautiful.

33:20.322 --> 33:21.855
It really is emotional.

33:21.855 --> 33:23.375
Gordon's brought some energy
back to a place

33:23.375 --> 33:23.589
Gordon's brought some energy
back to a place

33:23.589 --> 33:26.155
that was really,
really lacking.

33:26.155 --> 33:29.489
We've warmed up
the dining rooms

33:29.489 --> 33:31.555
with a nice, fresh champagne--

33:31.555 --> 33:32.655
wonderful color.

33:32.655 --> 33:34.189
It's really gorgeous.

33:34.189 --> 33:36.222
A textured art wall--

33:36.222 --> 33:37.755
Stunning.

33:37.755 --> 33:38.955
Look at your tables.

33:38.955 --> 33:42.022
New plates
without any chips in there.

33:42.022 --> 33:44.355
These are beautiful.
Beautiful, huh?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.422
Whoa!

33:45.422 --> 33:47.355
Come on, Van.

33:47.355 --> 33:48.822
What do you think?
It's a new restaurant.

33:48.822 --> 33:50.055
It's gorgeous.

33:50.055 --> 33:51.922
Just a complete makeover.

33:51.922 --> 33:53.289
It's a home run.

33:53.289 --> 33:53.375
It's amazing.
Thank you.

33:53.375 --> 33:54.555
It's amazing.
Thank you.

33:54.555 --> 33:56.022
Isn't that lovely?
It's amazing. Yes.

33:56.022 --> 33:57.622
Okay, there's more.
I want you to come through

33:57.622 --> 33:59.489
to the kitchen now--
come in.

33:59.489 --> 34:00.655
Right.

34:00.655 --> 34:02.455
Look at the space!

34:02.455 --> 34:04.789
Oh, my God,
this kitchen looks huge!

34:04.789 --> 34:06.122
Wow.

34:06.122 --> 34:08.822
Come in! There's more space
down here as well!

34:08.822 --> 34:11.222
Come in! Come in,
come in, come in.

34:11.222 --> 34:14.022
A proper kitchen
that's been de-cluttered.

34:14.022 --> 34:16.389
I didn't think we could do
this in here.

34:16.389 --> 34:17.622
Michael,
how does it feel?

34:17.622 --> 34:18.889
It feels amazing, chef.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.122
Yeah?
Yeah, it really does.

34:20.122 --> 34:21.722
I'm gonna look forward
to working in there.

34:21.722 --> 34:23.155
It's gonna be a breath
of fresh air.

34:23.155 --> 34:23.375
Okay, come outside--
one more thing.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.689
Okay, come outside--
one more thing.

34:27.855 --> 34:29.155
There you go.

34:29.155 --> 34:30.789
Oh, my God!

34:30.789 --> 34:32.055
Tavolini.

34:32.055 --> 34:34.322
"Family style dining."

34:34.322 --> 34:35.622
Oh, my God!

34:35.622 --> 34:37.055
A complete new identity.

34:37.055 --> 34:39.055
I'm very, very happy.

34:39.055 --> 34:40.889
It was so refreshing
and so new

34:40.889 --> 34:42.322
and so different,
so exciting,

34:42.322 --> 34:45.055
that you just really
want to just get to work

34:45.055 --> 34:46.222
and show it off
to everybody.

34:46.222 --> 34:48.022
That's your family
up there.

34:48.022 --> 34:50.055
Family-style dining, yes?
That's exactly right.

34:50.055 --> 34:52.455
Come in.

34:52.455 --> 34:53.375
Welcome to Tavolini's

34:53.375 --> 34:54.755
Welcome to Tavolini's

34:54.755 --> 34:57.355
new, exciting menu.
entrees--

34:57.355 --> 34:58.722
herb-roasted chicken,

34:58.722 --> 35:00.822
roasted with lemon,
thyme, and garlic.

35:00.822 --> 35:03.122
Branzino, a sort of
striped sea bass.

35:03.122 --> 35:06.655
Beautifully pan-roasted,
served with fennel and lemon.

35:06.655 --> 35:07.855
Real classic Italian,

35:07.855 --> 35:09.355
a stunning osso buco,

35:09.355 --> 35:10.889
veal demi-glace
and gremolata--

35:10.889 --> 35:12.789
so delicious.

35:12.789 --> 35:15.189
Everything is available
family style

35:15.189 --> 35:16.555
and ala carte.

35:16.555 --> 35:19.022
I want to sit down
and have dinner here.

35:19.022 --> 35:22.355
Get some forks
and start tasting.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.389
That sauce is...

35:26.389 --> 35:27.589
Oh, my goodness.

35:27.589 --> 35:29.689
I love it.

35:29.689 --> 35:31.355
This is gonna be such
the talk of the town.

35:31.355 --> 35:32.789
People are definitely gonna
want to come here and eat,

35:32.789 --> 35:34.922
because the food
is just amazing.

35:42.188 --> 35:44.488
With Cafe Tavolini
ready for relaunch...

35:44.488 --> 35:45.655
Hi. Welcome.

35:45.655 --> 35:48.088
Your server will explain
the new menu to you.

35:48.088 --> 35:49.822
And Chef Ramsay's new menu
in place...

35:49.822 --> 35:52.555
It's an individual portion
or a family portion.

35:52.555 --> 35:53.375
So you can get a couple
of different things.

35:53.375 --> 35:54.655
So you can get a couple
of different things.

35:54.655 --> 35:56.055
Oh, yeah!
It's really cool.

35:56.055 --> 35:57.888
It's time for Keith and Lisa

35:57.888 --> 35:59.622
To show
that they are capable

35:59.622 --> 36:01.588
of leading and managing
their restaurant.

36:01.588 --> 36:03.522
Folks...
Welcome to Tavolini.

36:03.522 --> 36:05.055
How are you?
Good, how are you?

36:05.055 --> 36:07.155
I'll be boppin' around tonight,
making sure everything's fine.

36:07.155 --> 36:08.855
Thank you for coming in.

36:08.855 --> 36:10.455
Tonight I need to give my all

36:10.455 --> 36:13.288
To try to make this restaurant
a success.

36:13.288 --> 36:14.722
But I'm just nervous.

36:17.988 --> 36:21.488
Branzino is the--
uh, it's the roasted...

36:21.488 --> 36:22.555
Um...

36:22.555 --> 36:23.375
I don't know
what that is.

36:23.375 --> 36:23.955
I don't know
what that is.

36:23.955 --> 36:26.522
Look at that.
What are you doing?

36:26.522 --> 36:29.322
Branzino.
Yeah.

36:29.322 --> 36:30.822
The branzino is what?
It's pork?

36:30.822 --> 36:32.122
Fish.
That's the fish.

36:32.122 --> 36:33.055
That's right.

36:33.055 --> 36:34.455
Well, actually, it's a--

36:34.455 --> 36:36.455
it's--it's similar to--
it's a fish dish.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.855
Ohh.
Tail on, head off.

36:37.855 --> 36:39.755
It's a little similar
to a, um--

36:39.755 --> 36:41.955
it's a white fish.
it's a white fish?

36:41.955 --> 36:43.588
Yes.
Very good.

36:43.588 --> 36:45.088
Yes.

36:45.088 --> 36:46.955
Michael, we got
a Tuscan soup,

36:46.955 --> 36:48.422
cauliflower,
mushroom polenta.

36:48.422 --> 36:49.388
Excellent.

36:49.388 --> 36:51.088
These first eight,
nine tables

36:51.088 --> 36:52.822
are crucial, yes?
yes.

36:52.822 --> 36:53.375
Talk together, yes?

36:53.375 --> 36:54.322
Talk together, yes?

36:54.322 --> 36:55.955
It's a half hour
into dinner service...

36:55.955 --> 36:57.855
Table six in the window.

36:57.855 --> 36:59.622
And the kitchen, led by Michael,
is humming.

36:59.622 --> 37:01.422
For this table right now,

37:01.422 --> 37:03.288
I just need a crostini
and a calamari.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.622
Nice, nice, nice.
Lovely.

37:04.622 --> 37:05.855
Enjoy.
Yummy.

37:05.855 --> 37:06.888
It's good?
Mm-hmm.

37:06.888 --> 37:08.588
Yeah.

37:08.588 --> 37:10.355
And it appears
as though everyone

37:10.355 --> 37:12.388
is loving
the new Tavolini experience.

37:12.388 --> 37:14.022
Really,
really exciting.

37:14.022 --> 37:16.555
I'm glad you're excited.
My heart has not stopped.

37:16.555 --> 37:18.522
Okay, good.
Let's keep it that way.

37:18.522 --> 37:21.422
Half an hour into service.
Keep it going, yes?

37:21.422 --> 37:22.722
Everything's going
really, really well.

37:22.722 --> 37:23.375
It reminded me
of five years ago

37:23.375 --> 37:24.222
It reminded me
of five years ago

37:24.222 --> 37:26.188
when we first opened--
we had this vibe,

37:26.188 --> 37:27.955
and I always wanted to be here
when it was busy.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.555
Keith, what's
the overall consensus?

37:29.555 --> 37:30.722
Are they happy?
Are they enjoying it?

37:30.722 --> 37:32.122
So far, so good.

37:34.888 --> 37:36.722
It's now an hour into service,

37:36.722 --> 37:39.122
and Tavolini's new appetizers
are a hit.

37:39.122 --> 37:40.288
I loved it.

37:40.288 --> 37:41.822
But back in the kitchen...

37:41.822 --> 37:43.688
I got two Tuscan beans
comin' for you as well

37:43.688 --> 37:47.088
with the two mussels, Danny.
what two mussels?

37:47.088 --> 37:49.288
The smooth-running machine
has now hit a major speed bump.

37:49.288 --> 37:51.188
You're plating two mussels
right now.

37:51.188 --> 37:53.375
And the dinner service
is about to crumble.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.122
And the dinner service
is about to crumble.

37:54.122 --> 37:56.155
Michael, what--this is
my calamari, right?

37:56.155 --> 37:57.688
Is that right?
Is this Lisa's table, Dan?

37:57.688 --> 37:59.455
No, this is Van's
table coming!

37:59.455 --> 38:00.822
See this is--
I'm getting a little lost.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.522
Dan, you gotta tell me
what you're giving me.

38:02.522 --> 38:04.022
Mike, you got tickets
over there too!

38:04.022 --> 38:05.422
Talk to me, Michael.
What's coming next?

38:05.422 --> 38:07.222
I'm a little  with
the tickets for some reason.

38:07.222 --> 38:09.588
There's another disaster
in the kitchen.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.688
It's a big cluster.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.055
Nobody knows
what's going on anymore.

38:12.055 --> 38:13.855
It's so much ,
it's not even funny!

38:13.855 --> 38:14.922
Mushrooms, please.

38:14.922 --> 38:16.155
Where's my mushroom polenta?

38:16.155 --> 38:17.722
Mushroom polenta's
coming right now!

38:21.455 --> 38:22.688
Danny, how long
for the polenta?

38:22.688 --> 38:23.375
For the polenta,
we're using this right here.

38:23.375 --> 38:24.788
For the polenta,
we're using this right here.

38:24.788 --> 38:27.122
I know how to  cook it,
but how long?

38:27.122 --> 38:28.355
You just hold on
one second.

38:28.355 --> 38:29.522
Come on, guys.

38:29.522 --> 38:31.788
The kitchen is just
a whole mess.

38:31.788 --> 38:33.455
Michael...
What? Michael what?

38:33.455 --> 38:34.555
Five's meal!

38:34.555 --> 38:36.055
Have they gotten
anything yet?

38:36.055 --> 38:37.655
No.

38:37.655 --> 38:40.455
it's like the worst
thing

38:40.455 --> 38:42.255
you could ever ask for.

38:42.255 --> 38:43.288
Come on, man.

38:52.058 --> 38:53.924
It's two hours
into dinner service,

38:53.924 --> 38:55.258
and the confusion
in the kitchen...

38:55.258 --> 38:57.258
It's so much ,
it's not even funny.

38:57.258 --> 39:00.158
Is putting a successful
relaunch in jeopardy.

39:00.158 --> 39:01.958
I'm a little  with
the tickets for some reason.

39:01.958 --> 39:03.391
Where's Keith?

39:03.391 --> 39:04.691
And Chef Ramsay knows

39:04.691 --> 39:06.391
that there is no
better time than now

39:06.391 --> 39:09.391
for these formerly passive
owners to step up.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.458
Keith!
Yes, sir?

39:11.458 --> 39:13.124
You know
this is not right.

39:13.124 --> 39:14.458
I--without a doubt.

39:14.458 --> 39:15.858
Get it together, please.

39:15.858 --> 39:17.224
Absolutely.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.724
Yeah, come on, then.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.360
Chef Ramsay lit a fire
under my butt.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.291
Chef Ramsay lit a fire
under my butt.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.358
Keith, I need you now
to pull this back.

39:23.358 --> 39:26.124
I realized that I needed
to get my hands dirty

39:26.124 --> 39:27.358
to make this thing
a success.

39:27.358 --> 39:29.724
So what--
so what should we do now?

39:29.724 --> 39:30.858
You gotta persevere, guys.

39:30.858 --> 39:32.358
Gotta persevere.

39:32.358 --> 39:34.558
Keith, get behind the line
and get them together!

39:34.558 --> 39:35.991
Okay, what we gotta do

39:35.991 --> 39:38.358
is try to work together
as a team.

39:38.358 --> 39:39.858
It's gonna take a minute,
but we have to focus here.

39:39.858 --> 39:41.124
Yes, sir.
All right, baby.

39:41.124 --> 39:43.024
Let's do this!
Look, we're going

39:43.024 --> 39:44.424
with Lisa's table,
then we're going with Van!

39:44.424 --> 39:45.824
With Keith and Lisa

39:45.824 --> 39:47.458
now actively supporting
their team...

39:47.458 --> 39:49.124
Guys, everything
looks fabulous.

39:49.124 --> 39:49.360
The kitchen somehow
manages to recover...

39:49.360 --> 39:51.691
The kitchen somehow
manages to recover...

39:51.691 --> 39:53.124
Table ten is what
I'm picking up.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.958
Calamari and
a roasted chicken, right?

39:54.958 --> 39:55.991
That's it.
Here, Michael.

39:55.991 --> 39:57.658
Thanks, pal.

39:57.658 --> 39:59.491
And pushes out the remainder
of the dishes...

39:59.491 --> 40:01.191
This is table 15 for Lisa.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.158
That looks good.
Looks very good.

40:03.158 --> 40:05.691
To very content customers.

40:05.691 --> 40:07.024
Wow.

40:07.024 --> 40:09.291
That is absolutely amazing.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.724
That's it. That's done.
That's gone.

40:10.724 --> 40:12.158
Perfect, bro.
We're beautiful.

40:12.158 --> 40:14.091
Guys, I'm really,
really proud of you

40:14.091 --> 40:15.958
you guys are a really
amazing team.

40:15.958 --> 40:16.958
Thank you, boss.

40:16.958 --> 40:18.924
If we can have Tavolini

40:18.924 --> 40:19.360
be successful like tonight,

40:19.360 --> 40:20.858
be successful like tonight,

40:20.858 --> 40:23.258
I think everything will--
will work itself out.

40:23.258 --> 40:27.024
And our marriage will have
a chance to be successful too.

40:27.024 --> 40:28.224
Have a great night.

40:28.224 --> 40:30.458
Everything was wonderful.
I appreciate that.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.624
That makes my night.
Thank you.

40:37.358 --> 40:39.891
Okay, tonight...

40:39.891 --> 40:43.958
We were teetering
on disaster.

40:43.958 --> 40:48.224
But it's not how start, it's
how you finish your service.

40:48.224 --> 40:49.360
Lisa and Keith...

40:49.360 --> 40:50.224
Lisa and Keith...

40:50.224 --> 40:52.924
You did a bloody good job.

40:52.924 --> 40:54.058
Well done.

40:55.324 --> 40:56.791
You all did a good job.

40:56.791 --> 40:57.958
Thank you, chef.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.258
I think we have
a lot of work

40:59.258 --> 41:00.558
still ahead of us.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.491
Um, I think tonight was
just a stepping stone.

41:02.491 --> 41:04.558
Absolutely right!

41:04.558 --> 41:06.258
Lisa, Keith...

41:06.258 --> 41:08.124
You've been given
a second chance.

41:08.124 --> 41:10.691
This restaurant needs you,

41:10.691 --> 41:13.191
not just the dining room,
but the kitchen.

41:13.191 --> 41:15.124
Yes, absolutely.
Keith...

41:15.124 --> 41:16.324
Loud and clear, Chef.

41:16.324 --> 41:17.724
Loud and clear.

41:17.724 --> 41:19.360
I think
that Gordon's motivation

41:19.360 --> 41:20.524
I think
that Gordon's motivation

41:20.524 --> 41:23.158
Brought some positive energy
back to a place

41:23.158 --> 41:26.558
that was really, really lacking
anything positive.

41:26.558 --> 41:28.824
Lisa, I can't do any more.

41:28.824 --> 41:32.124
I come back and that
front door is boarded up,

41:32.124 --> 41:33.858
I'm gonna be so upset.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.258
It won't be.

41:35.258 --> 41:36.424
Look after your family.

41:36.424 --> 41:39.124
Keep it going.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.858
Take care.
Okay.

41:40.858 --> 41:42.391
It is a little scary
that Gordon is leaving.

41:42.391 --> 41:44.358
You know, we have a long way
ahead of us now.

41:44.358 --> 41:47.291
And we have to really,
you know, just get to work.

41:47.291 --> 41:49.360
Don't you stop.
Okay?

41:49.360 --> 41:49.724
Don't you stop.
Okay?

41:51.924 --> 41:53.624
Yeah, keep it going.

41:53.624 --> 41:55.824
We have such a foundation
to work from,

41:55.824 --> 41:57.358
but with
our family problems,

41:57.358 --> 41:59.124
with the restaurant issues
all in one,

41:59.124 --> 42:01.058
it needs to start
from the bottom up,

42:01.058 --> 42:03.358
and I think we need to start
from a clean slate

42:03.358 --> 42:05.224
to, uh, you know,
be successful.

42:08.091 --> 42:09.858
Unbelievable.

42:09.858 --> 42:12.358
I'm actually shocked that this
has ended on a positive note.

42:12.358 --> 42:15.691
And who would have thought
that a family being ripped apart

42:15.691 --> 42:18.524
has been saved
by family-style dining?

42:18.524 --> 42:19.360
That's exactly what happened
here at Tavolini.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.458
That's exactly what happened
here at Tavolini.

42:22.458 --> 42:24.324
Finally...

42:24.324 --> 42:26.458
A taste of Italy.

42:26.458 --> 42:27.958
Grazie.

42:32.058 --> 42:33.424
In the weeks that followed...

42:33.424 --> 42:34.491
Yo, you find it
a little funny

42:34.491 --> 42:35.891
that they're outside
arguing right now?

42:35.891 --> 42:37.191
Keith and Lisa

42:37.191 --> 42:39.258
struggled with their new roles
as leaders.

42:39.258 --> 42:40.824
It's too much for me.

42:40.824 --> 42:42.624
And didn't commit
to the restaurant

42:42.624 --> 42:44.791
the way Chef Ramsay
had hoped.

42:44.791 --> 42:46.458
I need to have a puff
of my cigar.

42:46.458 --> 42:49.358
In addition, a rocky marriage

42:49.358 --> 42:49.360
That was moving
in the right direction

42:49.360 --> 42:50.824
That was moving
in the right direction

42:50.824 --> 42:52.124
is now over.

42:52.124 --> 42:53.158
What is going on here?

42:53.158 --> 42:54.224
Okay, do me a favor.

42:54.224 --> 42:56.324
I'd advise you
to zip it up.

42:56.324 --> 43:00.091
Keith and Lisa have separated.

43:00.091 --> 43:03.124
And the future of Tavolini
is uncertain.

43:03.124 --> 43:05.563
The doors are now closed,

43:05.563 --> 43:09.227
and one wonders, will they ever
open again?
