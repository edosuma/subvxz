WEBVTT

02:56.241 --> 02:57.609
What's
cooking, fuck chop?

03:00.545 --> 03:02.747
Hey, Fred.

03:02.781 --> 03:04.516
You ready for this?

03:04.550 --> 03:07.552
Deb's pregnant again.

03:07.586 --> 03:10.323
Uh, congratulations?

03:10.355 --> 03:13.391
Hey, how am I
supposed to afford a fifth kid?

03:13.425 --> 03:16.295
Christ almighty.

03:16.328 --> 03:18.798
Were you just not careful or?

03:18.830 --> 03:19.798
I don't know.

03:19.831 --> 03:20.966
You know how it is.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.002
Once those bodies
start slapping...

03:24.036 --> 03:24.871
Gross.

04:04.342 --> 04:05.310
Ah.

04:05.343 --> 04:06.311
Fantastic.

04:48.019 --> 04:49.688
Wait, what did
you mean by cadaver?

04:49.721 --> 04:50.622
Uncle Jesse.

04:50.656 --> 04:51.590
What's wrong with that?

04:51.622 --> 04:52.692
What isn't wrong with that?

04:52.725 --> 04:53.959
It's fucked up.

04:53.992 --> 04:55.093
You're supposed to
respect your cadaver.

04:55.127 --> 04:56.362
How was that not
showing respect?

04:56.394 --> 04:57.729
Uncle Jesse is the hot uncle.

04:57.762 --> 04:58.997
Michael, back me up here.

04:59.031 --> 05:00.733
What?

05:00.766 --> 05:01.801
On your own, man.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.768
Thank you.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.402
See.

05:04.435 --> 05:05.603
Not everyone is morally
bankrupt as you are, Justin.

05:05.637 --> 05:07.038
At least we're
taking pictures of him

05:07.072 --> 05:08.708
- like that guy from last year.
- Oh, my God.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.974
Yeah.

05:10.007 --> 05:11.509
He had to face the
family and apologize.

05:11.543 --> 05:13.745
It was a real black eye
to the nursing school.

05:13.778 --> 05:15.981
Anyway, so we're dissecting
uncle Jesse's pelvis...

05:42.074 --> 05:42.975
Ah.

05:43.007 --> 05:43.975
Let me give you a ride.

05:44.009 --> 05:44.811
It's freezing.

05:46.745 --> 05:47.713
Come on.

05:47.745 --> 05:48.714
Just let me give you a lift.

05:51.783 --> 05:56.721
Do I need to call
the cops again, Bob?

05:56.754 --> 05:58.658
Making me work for
it, tonight, huh?

06:07.598 --> 06:10.034
Hey, it's Fuck You Bob.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.503
Fuck You Bob.

06:11.536 --> 06:13.138
Fuck You Bob.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.473
All right.
All right.

06:14.505 --> 06:15.106
Dude.
Come on.

06:15.139 --> 06:16.541
Shut up.

06:16.574 --> 06:17.442
Why do they call
him "Fuck You Bob"?

06:17.475 --> 06:18.511
Wait for it.

06:18.543 --> 06:19.811
You're all strapped in, Bob.

06:19.845 --> 06:20.746
Fuck you.

06:24.483 --> 06:25.951
Hey, what's your 20?

06:25.983 --> 06:27.952
Uh, I'm just outside the loop.

06:27.985 --> 06:29.521
I've just picked up
Bob here, and he gave

06:29.555 --> 06:30.822
me a run for my money tonight.

06:30.855 --> 06:32.725
That's stubborn
old Bob for you.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.526
But tell him Fred says hi.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.730
He can probably hear you.

06:37.762 --> 06:38.997
He says hi.

06:39.031 --> 06:44.069
Can seven, which
means signing off.

06:44.101 --> 06:45.837
Look at him.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.138
He's all tuckered out.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.207
I love Justin.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.675
He's the best.

06:49.708 --> 06:50.943
Yeah.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.511
My last college didn't
have a drunk bus.

06:52.543 --> 06:53.978
It's a great idea.

06:54.012 --> 06:55.947
What made you decide
to become a bus driver?

06:55.980 --> 06:59.185
This and, uh, nude
modeling are the two

06:59.218 --> 07:01.520
highest paying jobs on campus.

07:01.552 --> 07:02.654
No offense, dude.

07:02.687 --> 07:03.923
I think I'd pick
the nude modeling.

07:03.956 --> 07:07.225
Less chance of being
puked on, I guess.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.961
Maybe.

07:09.995 --> 07:12.197
Justin tells me
you're really into film.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.533
I used to take a
lot of Polaroids.

07:15.567 --> 07:16.936
Did you study photography?

07:16.968 --> 07:18.903
Photojournalism.

07:18.937 --> 07:22.875
But, uh, I don't, I don't, uh,
really do that stuff anymore.

07:22.908 --> 07:25.911
I just transferred
here for museum studies.

07:25.944 --> 07:29.148
Our big project this semester is
to curate an original art show.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.983
I'm feeling really uninspired.

07:31.016 --> 07:34.920
I'd love to see
your work sometime.

07:34.952 --> 07:37.055
So are you seeing someone or?

07:37.088 --> 07:38.189
What?

07:38.223 --> 07:39.091
Oh, yeah.

07:39.124 --> 07:40.225
No.

07:40.259 --> 07:41.694
I just, uh, went
through a breakup.

07:41.726 --> 07:42.627
Yeah.

07:42.661 --> 07:43.629
Try nine months ago.

07:43.661 --> 07:44.697
Oh, I knew you were faking.

07:47.031 --> 07:47.932
I'm sorry.

07:47.966 --> 07:49.701
That really sucks.

07:49.735 --> 07:50.603
You guys date long?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.571
Uh, yeah.

07:52.603 --> 07:53.906
Since high school.

07:53.939 --> 07:57.276
Amy applied to KIT,
so I applied too.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.812
Planning on getting
married and everything.

07:59.845 --> 08:01.080
It's stupid.

08:01.112 --> 08:04.016
I don't think that's stupid.

08:04.048 --> 08:04.916
What?

08:04.949 --> 08:06.117
If I did, I'd tell you.

08:06.151 --> 08:07.286
It's a little stupid.

08:07.319 --> 08:08.220
Whatever.

08:08.252 --> 08:10.088
So what happened?

08:10.122 --> 08:14.627
I mean, after, uh,
after graduation,

08:14.660 --> 08:15.861
she moved to New
York and said that we

08:15.894 --> 08:16.961
should see other people.

08:16.995 --> 08:17.896
Ugh.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.766
Nine months ago.

08:20.798 --> 08:21.799
Uh, thank you, Justin.

08:21.833 --> 08:22.668
Dude.

08:27.038 --> 08:30.875
Got to get a stick
together, right?

08:30.908 --> 08:33.578
You've got to stay behind
the... the... the yellow line.

08:33.611 --> 08:37.115
My boyfriend broke
up with me today.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.183
Hey, do you want some water?

08:39.216 --> 08:44.822
He was, Oh, this is college.

08:44.855 --> 08:49.727
We're not supposed
to be tied down.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.762
Fuck him.

08:50.796 --> 08:51.730
Yeah.

08:51.763 --> 08:53.132
Seriously.
Fuck him.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.332
I'm trying to drive.

08:54.365 --> 08:55.934
You can't, you cannot
touch my arm I...

08:55.967 --> 08:56.968
My stomach hurts.

08:57.001 --> 08:57.902
Here.

08:57.936 --> 08:58.771
Take the water.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.346
I think she likes you.

09:15.921 --> 09:16.889
Hey.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.290
Yep.

09:18.322 --> 09:21.693
I know you.

09:21.726 --> 09:23.596
I thought you graduated already.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.001
I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:30.034 --> 09:31.736
No, no, please, please
don't throw up in here.

09:31.769 --> 09:32.737
Please.

09:32.770 --> 09:35.006
Please, please sit back.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.979
Oh my God.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.247
Oh, she pooped!

09:42.279 --> 09:43.182
She pooped!

09:43.215 --> 09:44.016
Oh my god!

10:13.678 --> 10:14.812
OK.

10:14.846 --> 10:15.748
Put that down.

10:15.780 --> 10:16.914
Take a bite.

10:16.947 --> 10:20.918
Is that bacon on a donut?

10:20.951 --> 10:24.155
It is a caramel bacon donut.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.357
They were out of
everything else.

10:32.163 --> 10:33.432
Well, that's, that's awesome.

10:33.465 --> 10:34.966
It's OK.

10:39.071 --> 10:46.445
You're awesome, and I
think we should do it.

10:46.477 --> 10:49.213
Let's get a place.

10:49.246 --> 10:50.982
I thought you said
you weren't ready.

10:51.015 --> 10:53.384
I am ready, and you're right.

10:53.418 --> 10:57.990
We do, we do work
really well together.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.225
Cool.

11:01.259 --> 11:02.728
Yeah.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.697
I love you.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.965
I love you too.

11:10.335 --> 11:12.838
Woo hoo!

11:12.870 --> 11:15.874
Is tonight the night?

11:18.876 --> 11:23.247
Lady, you
showed me

11:23.280 --> 11:27.218
all the tears you brought me.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.221
Broke my one rule.

11:29.254 --> 11:31.824
You treated me cruel.

11:45.803 --> 11:47.805
Hello.

11:47.839 --> 11:48.874
Oh.
Whoa.

11:48.907 --> 11:50.309
You're awake.

11:50.341 --> 11:52.244
Was just gonna leave
you a voicemail.

11:52.277 --> 11:53.378
How's it going?

11:53.410 --> 11:54.779
Good.

11:54.812 --> 11:55.847
Mom wants you to
call her, by the way.

11:55.880 --> 11:56.781
Oh, yeah.

11:56.815 --> 11:57.516
I gotta do that.

11:57.548 --> 11:59.250
OK.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.754
So listen, a paid internship
just opened up in my office.

12:01.787 --> 12:02.455
Interested?

12:05.791 --> 12:06.458
Dude.

12:06.490 --> 12:07.992
She's gone.

12:08.025 --> 12:10.128
You can't stay in that
town forever, waiting,

12:10.162 --> 12:13.165
living with that old loser.

12:13.197 --> 12:15.500
I mean, you graduated.

12:15.533 --> 12:20.105
It's time to just, just
come to Chicago and move on.

12:20.138 --> 12:21.038
Please.

12:21.072 --> 12:22.307
Love our talks.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.242
Come on.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.175
No, I got to go.

12:24.208 --> 12:27.145
Come on.

13:03.414 --> 13:04.315
Dude.

13:04.349 --> 13:05.250
I really got to pee.

13:05.283 --> 13:06.518
Come on.

13:06.551 --> 13:07.451
Come on.

13:07.485 --> 13:08.387
Come on.

13:08.419 --> 13:11.289
Oh, God.

13:11.322 --> 13:12.158
Oh.

13:16.027 --> 13:21.099
My pee always smells like,
uh, movie theatre popcorn.

13:21.131 --> 13:25.403
You know, like, fake,
hot butter stuff.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.206
I mean, don't get me wrong.

13:27.239 --> 13:30.509
I will still crush a bucket of
that stuff, no questions asked.

13:30.542 --> 13:33.412
I'm just saying,
like, if the ushers

13:33.445 --> 13:35.414
decide to pee in the butter.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.014
How would we ever know?

13:37.048 --> 13:39.484
There's no chance we would know.

13:39.517 --> 13:41.487
I probably have already
eaten some usher's piss.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.825
Hey, thank you.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.216
Accumulations of
up to 10 inches in some places.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.385
Bundle up if you're going
out, and make sure to check in

14:14.418 --> 14:17.622
on any loved ones.

14:17.655 --> 14:18.857
Hey, gang.

14:32.636 --> 14:34.005
Congrats.

14:34.038 --> 14:35.640
You're nearing a
milestone in your career

14:35.673 --> 14:37.576
with the campus bus service.

14:37.609 --> 14:40.045
Four years without an incident.

14:40.077 --> 14:41.379
Now if you make it to
the end of February

14:41.413 --> 14:43.916
without a traffic
violation, fender bender,

14:43.948 --> 14:47.485
or a pedestrian fatality, you'll
receive the prestigious all

14:47.519 --> 14:49.620
stars of safety plaque.

14:49.653 --> 14:52.124
Next step is becoming
a full time employee.

14:52.157 --> 14:56.128
I'm talking 25 grand a
year, health plan, 401k.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.194
Ha.

14:57.227 --> 14:58.496
Keep up the good work.

14:58.529 --> 15:01.699
Sincerely, Fred Quigley.

15:01.732 --> 15:04.468
PS I burped my breakfast
burrito into this envelope.

15:04.501 --> 15:07.371
Ugh.

15:07.404 --> 15:08.307
Four years.

15:14.645 --> 15:18.182
So
what do you think?

15:18.216 --> 15:20.118
About what?

15:20.150 --> 15:21.986
The
all stars of safety.

15:22.019 --> 15:23.154
I won't lie.

15:23.187 --> 15:24.722
It's a pretty big deal.

15:24.755 --> 15:28.025
You get your name engraved on
a plaque right next to mine.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.929
That's immortality,
assuming you make it.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.268
I hope you're not still
thinking about that Amy girl.

15:36.301 --> 15:38.136
Get your head in the game.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.504
Eye on the prize.

15:39.537 --> 15:43.608
Don't want anything
happening to my protege.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.543
Protege.

15:55.086 --> 15:56.754
Maybe she's
just being friendly.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.322
I don't know.

15:58.355 --> 16:00.091
If it was a regular
smiley face, I'd

16:00.125 --> 16:03.260
give her the benefit of the
doubt, but winky smiley face.

16:03.293 --> 16:04.462
The bitch wants
to be born again.

16:04.495 --> 16:06.230
What?

16:06.264 --> 16:09.167
She wants to taste the body
of Christ, crucify her vagina.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.469
No offense, guys.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.003
Why are we still
talking about this?

16:12.037 --> 16:14.105
Jesus, Kat, tell
us how you really feel.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.507
All right.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.575
I feel like she's
messing with your head.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.076
I feel like she's
playing games, and it's

16:19.110 --> 16:21.013
getting a little masochistic.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.414
I think you were Michael
and Amy for so long

16:22.447 --> 16:24.716
that you forgot how
to be just Michael.

16:24.749 --> 16:27.119
I'm alone on the
bus every night.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.754
I mean, alone alone.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.057
Like, you remember my
breakup last summer?

16:32.090 --> 16:33.392
Hm-mm.

16:33.424 --> 16:36.127
Afterwards, I went and
traveled South America

16:36.160 --> 16:38.496
by myself, which was scary.

16:38.529 --> 16:39.430
It was fun.

16:39.464 --> 16:41.033
It was...

16:41.066 --> 16:42.567
Super lonely?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.269
Yeah.

16:44.302 --> 16:46.538
At times, it was, but, you
know, the world didn't end.

16:46.571 --> 16:49.341
It's OK to be by yourself.

16:49.374 --> 16:51.308
I don't want you to get stuck
in a crappy relationship

16:51.341 --> 16:52.244
for fear of being alone.

16:56.346 --> 16:57.682
Shit.
I got to go, guys.

16:57.715 --> 16:58.617
Sorry.

16:58.649 --> 17:00.217
All right.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.120
Well, if you do go
to South America.

17:02.153 --> 17:03.788
You can call up
one of my cousins.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.490
They'll show you around.

17:15.365 --> 17:16.468
Ew.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.635
It smells like
dookie up in here.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.420
Open up.

17:35.452 --> 17:37.088
Open up.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.423
Wait, wait, wait.

17:38.455 --> 17:39.356
I got a keg.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.692
You can't bring a ke...

17:44.761 --> 17:46.263
what are you doing
with that, man?

17:46.297 --> 17:48.834
Some freshmen paid me
to pick it up for them,

17:48.866 --> 17:50.801
and, of course, the battery
died in my car, so...

17:50.835 --> 17:51.836
Dude.

17:51.869 --> 17:53.437
You know, you can go to jail.

17:53.471 --> 17:56.508
Well, if you think of
a better way to make $47,

17:56.540 --> 17:58.742
I'd love to hear about
it, or if you would just

17:58.776 --> 18:00.812
put in a good word with
Fred for me, like I asked,

18:00.845 --> 18:02.213
I wouldn't have to do this.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.648
Fred's not going
to hire you back.

18:03.681 --> 18:04.615
Why not?

18:04.648 --> 18:06.283
Josh, you know why not.

18:06.317 --> 18:10.521
It's because I'm a registered
sex offender, isn't it?

18:10.555 --> 18:11.556
OK.

18:11.588 --> 18:13.424
Well, it was public urination.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.625
I have a small bladder.

18:14.659 --> 18:16.394
I mean, in hindsight,
should I have

18:16.426 --> 18:18.195
found a more discreet
location than a Chuck

18:18.229 --> 18:19.698
E. Cheese parking lot at lunch?

18:19.730 --> 18:21.599
Sure, but do I
deserve to be branded

18:21.633 --> 18:23.335
a monster for the
rest of my life,

18:23.367 --> 18:25.236
because I take a leak in public?

18:25.269 --> 18:26.471
- Fuck no.
- Uh, whatever.

18:26.503 --> 18:27.404
I don't care.

18:27.438 --> 18:28.440
Just bring it on.

18:28.472 --> 18:29.574
- Do it quick, please.
- OK.

18:29.606 --> 18:31.209
Thank you.

18:31.241 --> 18:32.877
I don't know why you
want to bring a keg of beer

18:32.911 --> 18:35.413
onto a bus full of drunk
college kids anyway.

18:35.445 --> 18:36.347
OK.

18:36.381 --> 18:37.682
Put down the ramp.

18:37.714 --> 18:38.884
- No, not for you.
- Put down the ramp, dude.

18:38.916 --> 18:39.750
Just get it on.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.229
Fuck you.

19:03.473 --> 19:07.846
The wheels on
the bus go round and round.

19:07.878 --> 19:10.247
Round and round.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.649
Round and round.

19:11.682 --> 19:15.953
The wheels on the bus
go round and round.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.757
All through the town.

19:18.789 --> 19:19.790
Micheal.

19:19.824 --> 19:20.659
Michael.

19:36.740 --> 19:41.278
The wipers on the bus
go swish, swish, swish.

19:41.311 --> 19:42.680
Swish, swish, swish.

19:42.713 --> 19:44.615
Suck my dick.

20:01.699 --> 20:03.602
You're my protege.

20:10.674 --> 20:11.976
Fuck you.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.356
Hey.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.258
What the?

20:26.290 --> 20:27.392
Stop the fucking bus.

20:27.424 --> 20:29.293
That was my stop.

20:29.326 --> 20:30.862
Hey, asshole.

20:30.894 --> 20:32.698
Stop the bus now.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.703
Shut the fuck up.

20:39.737 --> 20:41.740
Everyone, shut the fuck up.

20:41.772 --> 20:44.742
Stop messing around with
Bob, or you're off the bus.

20:47.944 --> 20:48.746
Bob, you OK?

20:51.682 --> 20:53.652
Fuck you.

21:03.361 --> 21:07.532
You got to stay
behind the line, man.

21:13.738 --> 21:23.749
We were all wounded
at Wounded Knee, you and me,

21:24.648 --> 21:34.625
we were all wounded at
Wounded Knee, you and me,

21:35.625 --> 21:41.665
in the name of manifest destiny.

21:41.699 --> 21:42.534
You and me.

22:21.538 --> 22:24.541
It smells like shit in here.

22:24.575 --> 22:26.644
Like, actual shit.

22:26.676 --> 22:29.546
Did you shit?

22:29.579 --> 22:31.682
I'm Pineapple.

22:31.715 --> 22:34.051
You say your name's Pineapple?

22:34.085 --> 22:35.886
Yeah.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.589
The bus service.

22:37.622 --> 22:38.923
They hired me.

22:38.955 --> 22:43.394
To give me a tattoo?

22:43.428 --> 22:44.529
No.

22:44.561 --> 22:45.729
To protect you.

22:45.762 --> 22:48.732
I'm in security.

22:48.766 --> 22:49.667
Oh, dude.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.934
No.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.437
I, I've been doing
this for a long time.

22:52.470 --> 22:53.637
That kid was just being a dick.

22:53.671 --> 22:55.038
I... I really...

22:55.071 --> 22:56.640
I don't need any, you know...

22:56.673 --> 22:58.576
Sure about that, homie?

22:58.608 --> 22:59.977
Doesn't look too good.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.945
Here, try this.

23:01.979 --> 23:04.548
It's witch hazel.

23:04.582 --> 23:07.519
It will help with
the inflammation.

23:07.551 --> 23:09.620
You carry witch
hazel with you?

23:09.653 --> 23:11.823
Yeah.

23:11.855 --> 23:13.424
Look.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.527
Next time some drunk
motherfucker steps you, give

23:15.559 --> 23:18.061
them one of these to the head.

23:18.095 --> 23:20.198
Will stop the fight
before it even starts.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.166
Here, try it.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.468
I'm good.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.735
Go ahead.

23:24.769 --> 23:26.770
Hit it.

23:26.804 --> 23:29.541
What the fuck was that bullshit?

23:29.574 --> 23:32.509
Headbutt my fucking hand.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.578
There you go.

23:34.612 --> 23:37.015
It's better than breaking your
hand on some joker's face,

23:37.048 --> 23:39.083
'cause then you gotta
fuck your other hand,

23:39.115 --> 23:41.519
and that definitely sucks.

23:41.551 --> 23:42.586
Hey, fuck chop.

23:42.619 --> 23:44.588
You didn't leave yet, did you?

23:44.622 --> 23:45.890
No, I'm... I'm...

23:45.923 --> 23:46.924
I'm still here.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.692
Did you guys hire a, um-

23:48.726 --> 23:50.628
Well, due to
last night's incident, which

23:50.661 --> 23:52.864
won't affect your eligibility
for the safety award,

23:52.896 --> 23:57.167
so don't worry, we hired a guy
at work security temporarily.

23:57.201 --> 23:59.103
He calls himself Pineapple.

23:59.135 --> 24:00.771
Fred.

24:00.805 --> 24:02.707
He's got
tattoos covering his face.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.807
Wait till you see this fat fuck.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.609
Fred.

24:05.643 --> 24:07.846
Dude looks like
a Darth Maul fucked fat Albert.

24:07.878 --> 24:09.480
- I'm not shitting you...
- Fred.

24:09.513 --> 24:11.014
Now, if
tons of fun gives you...

24:11.048 --> 24:13.518
Hey, Fred.

24:13.550 --> 24:16.086
It's Pineapple.

24:16.119 --> 24:19.490
You want me to come in
there and murder you?

24:23.227 --> 24:24.863
That
won't be, uh, necessary.

24:24.895 --> 24:27.865
Uh, you... hey, you
all be safe out there.

24:27.898 --> 24:29.500
You too, Fred.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.503
We joke
around here, Pineapple.

24:31.536 --> 24:32.703
Let's go.

24:32.737 --> 24:33.872
- I
- knew you were there.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.987
Yo.

24:49.019 --> 24:50.754
You ever hit it
with a passenger?

24:50.788 --> 24:53.825
Usually, just, uh, drive
them to the bars and back.

24:53.857 --> 24:55.158
Shit, son.

24:55.192 --> 24:56.760
Do you even know
what you missing?

24:59.130 --> 25:00.031
What?

25:00.064 --> 25:01.798
You got a girlfriend?

25:01.832 --> 25:07.205
Uh, yeah, uh, she's
in, uh, in New York.

25:11.008 --> 25:11.910
What?

25:11.942 --> 25:14.144
It's Samoan, man.

25:14.178 --> 25:17.081
It means, the net's
hanging up to dry,

25:17.114 --> 25:20.817
but it'll be used
for fishing again.

25:20.851 --> 25:23.922
Kind of just got to, uh,
focus on the road here, man.

25:23.954 --> 25:25.088
My bad.

25:25.122 --> 25:25.957
You do you.

25:34.632 --> 25:36.200
What?

25:36.232 --> 25:42.039
Tell me if I'm off base, but
you never shampooed the wookie.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.108
I had a girlfriend
for five years.

25:44.141 --> 25:47.077
Yeah, but it didn't mean
you got your twinkie stinky.

25:47.111 --> 25:48.012
It's all right, man.

25:48.045 --> 25:50.949
Just own it.

25:50.981 --> 25:54.251
So am I wrong?

26:08.699 --> 26:09.933
Love you.
Goodnight.

26:09.967 --> 26:10.868
Love you.

26:10.901 --> 26:11.736
Night.

26:16.773 --> 26:18.775
What's that doing here?

26:18.808 --> 26:19.911
What?

26:19.943 --> 26:22.713
You're poking me
with your boner.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.349
I can't really help it.

26:24.382 --> 26:26.784
Then maybe go to the bathroom
and jerk off or something.

26:26.817 --> 26:27.986
I have to get up early tomorrow.

26:31.122 --> 26:33.891
Why is premarital
sex so wrong, but

26:33.923 --> 26:35.893
masturbating's totally fine?

26:35.925 --> 26:38.096
Because you're the one who
has to answer to the Lord

26:38.128 --> 26:41.164
for your behavior, not me.

26:41.198 --> 26:44.134
Night.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.036
So you're a virgin.

26:46.069 --> 26:47.171
Keep it down, man.

26:47.203 --> 26:48.038
Come on.

26:51.008 --> 26:52.076
What is that shit
you're drinking?

26:52.108 --> 26:53.744
It smells like absolute ass.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.947
Oh, it's
traditional Maui soup.

26:55.980 --> 26:59.983
Pureed seafood, pork bones,
some other shit in it.

27:00.017 --> 27:00.884
You want some?

27:00.917 --> 27:02.319
No, I'll pass.

27:02.353 --> 27:03.622
More for me.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.326
So what's Amy doing besides cock
teasing in the Five Boroughs?

27:09.359 --> 27:12.429
She's a junior fashion buyer.

27:12.462 --> 27:15.098
She did text me saying she's
going to be in town next week,

27:15.132 --> 27:18.169
and there was a winky
smiley face involved so.

27:18.201 --> 27:22.272
So that means she
wants your dick.

27:22.306 --> 27:25.242
Dude, we gotta get you laid.

27:25.276 --> 27:27.711
Fucking's important.

27:27.744 --> 27:29.846
A buddy of mine, he got married.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.950
On his wedding night, found out
she got an inside-out vagina.

27:32.982 --> 27:34.418
What's an inside-out vagina?

27:34.451 --> 27:36.186
Fuck if I know.

27:36.220 --> 27:37.822
He wasn't really taking
follow up questions.

27:37.855 --> 27:38.722
You feel me?

27:38.756 --> 27:40.191
A penis?

27:40.223 --> 27:42.426
Could be.

27:42.460 --> 27:46.096
Look, my point is you got
to make sure the parts fit

27:46.130 --> 27:46.965
before you commit.

27:49.866 --> 27:50.768
Yo.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.403
Let me get in on that.

28:14.525 --> 28:16.994
Oh, uh, Pineapple, it's Bob.

28:17.027 --> 28:19.197
Bob, that's Pineapple.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.397
Yo, what's up, Bob?

28:23.433 --> 28:26.336
You.

28:26.369 --> 28:28.805
This guy's awesome.

28:28.838 --> 28:30.240
Where do you take him?

28:30.273 --> 28:32.109
If we can actually convince
him to get on the bus,

28:32.143 --> 28:34.112
I usually drop him off
at the old flour mill.

28:34.144 --> 28:36.413
Oh, yeah, what's over there?

28:36.446 --> 28:37.447
I don't know.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.250
He's definitely not telling.

28:39.282 --> 28:42.185
Apparently, he used to
teach art here in the 70s.

28:42.219 --> 28:43.086
No one really knows.

28:43.119 --> 28:43.954
He's kind of a mystery.

28:50.861 --> 28:52.230
Yo.

28:52.262 --> 28:55.165
You see those two
girls back there?

28:55.199 --> 28:58.769
If I get them to kiss, you
let me get behind the wheel.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.105
Go for it.

29:04.141 --> 29:06.544
Check check.

29:06.576 --> 29:08.378
How's everybody doing
out there tonight?

29:11.248 --> 29:15.286
I said, how's everybody
doing out there tonight?

29:19.856 --> 29:20.524
Yeah, this is good.

29:24.127 --> 29:25.028
Come on, guys.

29:25.061 --> 29:27.998
Get up.

29:28.031 --> 29:28.932
Get up.

29:37.040 --> 29:37.875
Damn.

29:53.289 --> 29:54.291
Look, dude.

29:54.325 --> 29:55.526
It's going to happen.

29:55.558 --> 29:56.560
Look.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.862
Going to fucking happen.

30:01.898 --> 30:03.233
Ah, ah.

30:03.267 --> 30:05.202
Aah!

30:05.236 --> 30:07.572
Yo, yo, check it!

30:07.605 --> 30:09.039
Ugh.

30:09.073 --> 30:15.046
This
thing handles like shit.

30:15.078 --> 30:15.980
I know.

30:16.012 --> 30:16.913
You get used to it.

30:16.946 --> 30:19.250
Just be careful please.

30:19.282 --> 30:23.920
So you drive the same
route, night after night,

30:23.953 --> 30:24.922
over and over?

30:24.954 --> 30:25.923
That's the job.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.057
You ever go off-route?

30:27.090 --> 30:29.426
You're supposed
to stay on-route.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.895
What'd you do if I took
this bitch on the highway?

30:31.929 --> 30:35.432
I would lose my job and then
probably get arrested so let's

30:35.465 --> 30:36.300
not do that.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.072
What the fuck was that?

30:41.105 --> 30:43.941
Frat kids.

30:43.973 --> 30:45.442
Do this a lot?

30:45.476 --> 30:47.578
Pretty much every night

30:47.611 --> 30:50.114
I'm going to ask
you a question,

30:50.146 --> 30:52.649
and I want you to
answer me truthfully.

30:52.682 --> 30:55.987
Do you want me to murder them?

30:56.019 --> 30:58.154
What's
your 20, fuck chop?

30:58.188 --> 31:01.592
Uh, uh, uh, uh, frat row.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.493
10-4.

31:03.527 --> 31:06.096
Hey, I feel like I may
have put too much pressure

31:06.130 --> 31:08.165
on you before about
the, uh, you know,

31:08.198 --> 31:10.268
the whole safety award thing.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.569
I'd like to give you some
advice that my mentor,

31:12.603 --> 31:16.340
the late great king of the
bus jockeys, Alan Clapper,

31:16.373 --> 31:18.342
once gave me when
I was your age.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.945
I hope it means as much
to you as it did to me.

31:24.213 --> 31:25.482
Shit right now.

31:25.516 --> 31:27.183
You
get all that, fuck chop?

31:27.217 --> 31:28.986
I'm not even
responding to that.

31:29.019 --> 31:30.654
I'm not wasting my fucking time.

31:30.688 --> 31:33.457
Same shit,
different toilet, huh?

31:33.490 --> 31:35.660
No, actually, it's more,
it's the same toilet,

31:35.692 --> 31:38.028
and it's constantly overflowing.

31:38.061 --> 31:38.962
What time is it?

31:38.996 --> 31:39.964
1:39.

31:39.997 --> 31:41.632
We pass, uh, we pass Zephyr.

31:41.664 --> 31:44.335
There's going to be a lady in
a green coat, walking her dog.

31:44.367 --> 31:45.602
Just going to smell its shit.

31:45.635 --> 31:46.436
Swear to God.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.143
Oh, no.

31:52.175 --> 31:53.043
Ugh.

31:53.076 --> 31:54.478
Oh, it's my favorite.

31:54.510 --> 31:58.348
Whoever updates that marquee
can't spell for shit.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.951
Free turnovers, yo.

32:00.984 --> 32:02.419
Oh, you see these
Christmas lights?

32:02.452 --> 32:03.354
Yeah, man.

32:03.386 --> 32:04.321
It's February.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.957
They're on a timer.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.557
And off.

32:07.590 --> 32:11.027
There's some
crazy deja vu shit.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.495
Reminds me of juvie.

32:12.528 --> 32:15.031
You were in
juvenile detention?

32:15.065 --> 32:16.334
Yeah, man.

32:16.366 --> 32:20.604
I did a year for B and
E back when I was 16.

32:20.636 --> 32:23.073
You must have owned the place.

32:23.106 --> 32:24.541
Nah.

32:24.575 --> 32:30.081
It was the same shit, day
after day, over and over.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.750
It was like being
stuck in a time loop.

32:32.782 --> 32:34.517
But big-ups to you, man.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.619
I don't know how
the fuck you do it.

32:40.289 --> 32:41.158
Trains.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.306
You're going to
drive yourself nuts.

32:58.208 --> 33:02.580
You're going to drive yourself
nuts obsessing over that text.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.016
What's with the winky
smiley face, though?

33:05.048 --> 33:07.317
What am I, what am I
supposed to think that she

33:07.351 --> 33:08.753
thinks that that means?

33:08.786 --> 33:09.620
Who cares?

33:12.756 --> 33:14.557
Man... Forget about it.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.659
I'll see you tomorrow, kid.

33:16.692 --> 33:18.128
Pineapple.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.498
Wait, what, what were
you going to say?

33:20.530 --> 33:21.398
Pineapple.

33:26.135 --> 33:28.538
Pineapple, what were
you going to say?

33:28.571 --> 33:29.472
Pineapple, come on.

33:29.506 --> 33:30.807
Dude.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.710
You're taking the small
shit in your small life

33:33.743 --> 33:37.714
and making a huge
deal out of it.

33:37.748 --> 33:41.117
What?

33:41.151 --> 33:42.019
Pineapple.

33:47.657 --> 33:49.159
What are you talking about?

33:49.192 --> 33:50.795
Dude.

33:50.827 --> 33:52.562
None of it matters.

33:52.596 --> 33:58.134
Your job, Amy,
the text, college.

33:58.167 --> 33:59.502
None of this matters.

33:59.536 --> 34:00.371
You feel me?

34:03.373 --> 34:06.610
A wise Samoan once said,
Change doesn't begin when

34:06.643 --> 34:09.146
you get a knock on your ass.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.449
It begins when you decide
to get on your feet again.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.583
Is that another old proverb?

34:13.617 --> 34:15.352
No.

34:15.385 --> 34:19.590
That's Dwayne the
motherfucking Rock Johnson.

34:19.623 --> 34:20.657
See you tomorrow, kid.

35:03.634 --> 35:06.369
Oh, great.

35:06.402 --> 35:07.304
Crap.

35:10.806 --> 35:12.542
Voice assistance by...

35:22.585 --> 35:24.921
This is what's
considered fun now?

35:24.954 --> 35:26.723
I can do it all night.

35:30.293 --> 35:31.494
Aw.

35:31.527 --> 35:32.762
That is a loose septum.

35:32.795 --> 35:34.731
Gonna have to do
better than that.

35:38.568 --> 35:40.170
That is the single
grossest thing

35:40.204 --> 35:41.438
I have ever seen in my life.

35:41.471 --> 35:42.706
Where's your wallet?

35:42.739 --> 35:44.875
It's right here.

35:44.907 --> 35:45.875
Yo.

35:45.909 --> 35:47.411
Who the fuck took my wallet?

35:49.713 --> 35:50.781
You got mad skills.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.215
Respect.
Yo!

35:52.248 --> 35:53.216
Get the fuck out of my face!

35:53.250 --> 35:54.784
Sit the fuck down.

35:54.818 --> 35:56.487
Chill the fuck out.

35:56.519 --> 35:59.222
Jesus.

35:59.255 --> 36:00.723
What do you guys think of him?

36:00.757 --> 36:02.860
I already like him better
than I ever liked you.

36:02.893 --> 36:04.595
Nobody messes with
you when he's around.

36:04.628 --> 36:05.596
Look at him.

36:05.628 --> 36:09.400
He's like the bro whisperer.

36:09.432 --> 36:10.333
What?

36:10.367 --> 36:11.569
You look high as fuck.

36:11.601 --> 36:13.203
I wish.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.572
Nope.

36:14.605 --> 36:15.806
All Tara.

36:15.838 --> 36:17.541
Who's Tara?

36:17.574 --> 36:19.677
She's a psycho who lives
in the dorm room next to Kat.

36:19.710 --> 36:20.844
She has night terrors.

36:20.876 --> 36:22.545
What are night terrors?

36:22.579 --> 36:24.748
It's, like, a condition
where you scream

36:24.780 --> 36:27.617
and thrash around your sleep,
but you're technically,

36:27.650 --> 36:28.952
like, fully asleep.

36:28.985 --> 36:30.853
We call her Night Tara.

36:30.887 --> 36:33.289
No, you call her Night Tara.

36:33.322 --> 36:34.791
Did it hurt?

36:34.824 --> 36:38.528
Yeah, it fucking hurt, but
it's tradition, you know.

36:38.561 --> 36:39.496
Look.

36:39.528 --> 36:40.898
I'm at the shop every day.

36:40.931 --> 36:42.365
Come on and see me.
I'll hook you up, all right?

36:42.398 --> 36:43.299
Yeah, sweet.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.468
You guys cool?

36:44.501 --> 36:45.402
Yeah.

36:45.434 --> 36:48.005
Shake.

36:48.038 --> 36:50.240
Hug.

36:50.273 --> 36:50.974
Come on.

36:51.007 --> 36:51.875
Get in there.

36:51.907 --> 36:53.409
All right.

36:53.443 --> 36:55.379
Because if I have to
come back here again,

36:55.411 --> 36:57.280
I'm going to rip your
fucking arms off.

37:00.684 --> 37:01.719
Yo.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.519
How do you do that?

37:03.552 --> 37:04.621
Do what?

37:04.655 --> 37:06.757
Calm those idiots down.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.324
Ah.

37:08.358 --> 37:09.760
Dude's don't want to fight, man.

37:09.793 --> 37:11.394
They want someone
to break it up,

37:11.427 --> 37:14.431
so they save face and
still look tough, you know?

37:14.463 --> 37:18.369
You're like Yoda.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.804
If Yoda ate Jabba the Hutt.

37:21.838 --> 37:23.740
I'm just good at talking
sense into people, you know?

37:23.773 --> 37:25.842
Hey, you should
meet Justin's parents.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.278
They're the last two people on
Earth who don't know he's gay.

37:28.311 --> 37:30.813
Well, I'm fine with them
thinking Kat's my girlfriend.

37:30.847 --> 37:33.951
Even if she is the
spawn of the colonizer.

37:33.983 --> 37:35.385
Give me their number.

37:35.418 --> 37:36.819
I'll fucking tell them.
I don't care.

37:36.853 --> 37:37.755
Yeah, right.

37:37.788 --> 37:38.889
No, really.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.356
I'll tell them for you.

37:40.389 --> 37:41.858
- We're not doing this.
- Yeah, we should.

37:41.891 --> 37:43.426
- No, we're not doing this.
- It's good for the soul.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.262
Shut the fuck up.

37:47.097 --> 37:48.632
I'm really starving.

37:48.664 --> 37:49.599
You wanna jump off?

37:49.632 --> 37:50.867
Here?

37:50.900 --> 37:53.403
There's a
around the corner.

37:53.436 --> 37:54.538
Ah, fine.

37:54.570 --> 37:57.641
But I'm never
going to eat again.

37:57.673 --> 37:59.076
- Bye, Pineapple.
- Later, yo.

37:59.108 --> 37:59.976
Bye.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.478
See you guys.

38:01.510 --> 38:04.514
Dude, she was a fucking
senior virgin, bro.

38:04.547 --> 38:08.718
Dude, after sophomore year,
there are no more virgins.

38:08.751 --> 38:10.320
She had to be lying.

38:10.353 --> 38:12.422
Dude, she's super fucking
Catholic or some shit.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.757
Convinced some fucking
sorry motherfucker

38:13.789 --> 38:15.358
they should wait till marriage.

38:15.391 --> 38:18.561
She traded in God for Todd.

38:18.594 --> 38:20.563
Dude, don't fucking
touch me, bro.

38:20.597 --> 38:22.566
Todd forgives, though.

38:22.599 --> 38:24.902
Todd moves in mysterious ways.

38:24.934 --> 38:25.869
Where is she now?

38:25.902 --> 38:26.836
New York?

38:26.869 --> 38:30.039
I don't fucking know, man.

38:30.072 --> 38:31.507
Not on my dick.

38:31.541 --> 38:33.010
It's all too irrelevant to me.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.811
What the hell
was her name again?

38:34.844 --> 38:36.946
Jamie.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.817
No, wait.

38:39.849 --> 38:41.384
Amy.

38:41.418 --> 38:42.653
Yeah, that's it, dude.

38:46.056 --> 38:47.590
I'm sorry, Bob.
You're good.

38:47.623 --> 38:48.458
Fuck you.

38:51.994 --> 38:52.962
See you, Bob.

38:57.567 --> 38:59.135
You're doing all right?

38:59.168 --> 39:01.003
You look whiter than usual.

39:01.036 --> 39:03.706
That guy in there, Todd.

39:03.739 --> 39:05.541
He had sex with Amy.

39:05.574 --> 39:07.110
Amy?

39:07.143 --> 39:08.846
Amy who?

39:08.878 --> 39:09.947
Argh.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.115
Amy?

39:11.148 --> 39:12.783
Let's fucking
go, bus bitch.

39:17.119 --> 39:18.822
Are we going to
fucking move or what?

39:23.760 --> 39:26.797
You want to hurt
that guy, don't you?

39:26.829 --> 39:27.965
Headbutt him.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.633
That's your answer
to everything.

39:29.666 --> 39:31.501
Because it works.

39:31.534 --> 39:32.502
Don't worry about his boy.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.037
I'll take care of him.

39:34.070 --> 39:35.838
Argh!

39:35.871 --> 39:38.007
At some point, you're going to
have to make an actual decision

39:38.041 --> 39:39.510
in your life.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.679
Might as well go in
there and headbutt Todd.

39:42.711 --> 39:45.615
I don't think you know me
well enough to be saying that.

39:45.648 --> 39:48.418
I had you figured out
the minute I met you.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.521
Now, get in there and headbutt
that smug motherfucker.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.389
Move.

40:07.637 --> 40:09.606
The fuck's your problem, bro?

40:20.050 --> 40:22.052
Um, there's no open
containers on the bus.

40:22.085 --> 40:22.887
Sorry.

40:46.976 --> 40:49.679
What a fucking loser.

40:49.713 --> 40:50.514
Finally.

41:00.690 --> 41:01.692
Yo.

41:01.724 --> 41:02.559
You going to eat that?

41:07.130 --> 41:10.166
Man, don't you fucking text her.

41:10.199 --> 41:12.969
This guy is just like the
complete opposite of me.

41:13.003 --> 41:15.239
I don't understand.

41:15.271 --> 41:18.976
I gotta know if they hooked up
before or after we broke up,

41:19.009 --> 41:20.543
and that's it.

41:20.577 --> 41:23.213
You think she's out
there thinking about you?

41:23.246 --> 41:24.847
She's not.

41:24.880 --> 41:29.252
She's probably fucked 10
more guys by now too, man.

41:29.286 --> 41:31.521
So how come you never left
Kent after all that went down.

41:31.554 --> 41:32.788
Hmm.

41:32.822 --> 41:33.789
Nothing better to do.

41:33.822 --> 41:35.057
That's a stupid answer.

41:35.090 --> 41:35.958
Why?

41:35.992 --> 41:37.594
Why are you here?

41:37.626 --> 41:39.295
Why would you leave a
tropical paradise for Ohio?

41:39.329 --> 41:42.266
KIT's got a sick
ass nursing school.

41:42.298 --> 41:43.634
Nursing?

41:43.666 --> 41:46.269
Sick ass.

41:46.302 --> 41:48.070
That's awe... that's awesome.

41:48.103 --> 41:50.306
My professors,
they told me I was

41:50.340 --> 41:52.843
going to scare the patients.

41:52.876 --> 41:54.211
Whatever.

41:54.244 --> 41:57.047
So you, you dropped out?

41:57.079 --> 41:59.549
No, I left when my
lady got pregnant.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.284
Wait.

42:00.317 --> 42:01.318
You have a kid?

42:01.351 --> 42:04.186
Yeah, man.

42:04.219 --> 42:05.622
She's going to be 11 this month.

42:08.257 --> 42:10.026
I'm just fucking with you.

42:10.059 --> 42:12.028
That's her.

42:12.061 --> 42:13.730
How fucking old are you?

42:16.298 --> 42:18.802
Are you and the mom
still, uh, cool or?

42:18.835 --> 42:20.737
Nah.

42:20.769 --> 42:22.639
Katie lives with
her up in Cleveland,

42:22.672 --> 42:24.608
but I still support her.

42:24.641 --> 42:28.244
That's why I got the job
protecting your bitch ass.

42:28.277 --> 42:31.681
What is, what is,
can we, think about...

42:31.715 --> 42:33.617
She's cool with it.

42:33.650 --> 42:35.818
She's used to it, anyways.

42:35.851 --> 42:37.353
Sometimes her classmates
make fun of her,

42:37.387 --> 42:38.856
but she's tough like
her old man, you know?

42:41.690 --> 42:44.160
I guess you sticking
around makes sense, too.

42:44.193 --> 42:46.128
I wouldn't want to leave the
carefree college days neither,

42:46.161 --> 42:48.030
you know?

42:48.063 --> 42:49.799
Not really like that.

42:49.833 --> 42:53.235
I mean, when everyone else was
studying abroad or partying,

42:53.268 --> 42:54.837
I was usually just
driving the bus,

42:54.871 --> 42:58.108
or I was with Amy,
watching the fucking

42:58.141 --> 43:00.844
"Notebook" or something.

43:00.876 --> 43:03.679
What do you have
against Ryan Gosling, yo?

43:03.713 --> 43:04.915
Nothing.

43:04.947 --> 43:05.915
He's fine.

43:05.949 --> 43:07.851
God damn right.

43:07.884 --> 43:10.052
He's super fine.

43:10.085 --> 43:13.222
And sexy.

43:13.255 --> 43:14.924
So why'd you stick around?

43:18.193 --> 43:20.262
You're like a ghost, man.

43:20.295 --> 43:21.797
You're not living in Kent.

43:21.831 --> 43:24.701
You're fucking haunting it.

43:24.733 --> 43:25.902
Look.

43:25.934 --> 43:26.903
What you need is a do-over.

43:30.206 --> 43:33.777
You see those 40s over
there, grab two bottles,

43:33.809 --> 43:35.244
and let's dip.

43:35.277 --> 43:37.213
No.

43:37.246 --> 43:40.182
I'm not st... stealing
40s with you.

43:40.215 --> 43:41.717
You want a fucking do-over?

43:41.751 --> 43:43.787
It starts with
those two bottles.

43:43.820 --> 43:47.758
Grab the two bottles
and let's dip.

43:47.791 --> 43:50.126
The guy's right
her... right there.

43:50.159 --> 43:51.193
He's sleeping.

43:51.226 --> 43:52.828
He won't even miss it.

43:52.862 --> 43:55.766
Quit being a bitch, grab
those 40s, and let's dip.

44:00.869 --> 44:01.704
Go.

44:04.740 --> 44:05.708
OK.

44:05.742 --> 44:06.810
Fine.

44:06.842 --> 44:09.879
Yeah.

44:22.858 --> 44:25.194
Hey, keeping
it safe out there, fuck chop?

44:25.228 --> 44:27.197
Yeah, yeah, Fred.

44:27.230 --> 44:29.800
You know it.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.168
Hey, Fred!

44:31.201 --> 44:33.103
Who's the fuck chop now?

44:52.521 --> 44:53.757
No, no, no, no, no no!

44:53.789 --> 44:55.125
Absolutely not!
No, no, no, no.

44:55.157 --> 44:56.226
Pineapple, I'm still driving.

44:56.259 --> 44:57.226
Stop.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.262
Stop.

44:59.295 --> 45:00.197
Fuck you!

45:00.230 --> 45:01.731
Fuck you!

45:36.932 --> 45:39.302
Wait, wait.

45:39.335 --> 45:40.871
Why are we doing this again?

45:40.903 --> 45:42.472
Ladies love it.

45:42.505 --> 45:44.074
Here.
Swish.

45:44.106 --> 45:44.942
Swish with this.

45:48.811 --> 45:50.480
So you took all these photos?

45:53.983 --> 45:56.519
So that's Amy.

45:56.552 --> 45:59.288
Damn, son.

45:59.322 --> 46:01.258
Now I get it.

46:01.291 --> 46:04.094
Come on, man.

46:04.126 --> 46:05.427
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.328
Let's do it.
Let's do it now.

46:06.362 --> 46:07.097
- I'm ready.
- OK.

46:10.333 --> 46:15.172
So in ancient times, they
used to pierce three times

46:15.204 --> 46:17.507
to reach a higher
plane of consciousness

46:17.539 --> 46:19.342
and to speak with gods.

46:19.375 --> 46:21.344
Is that gonna happen with me?

46:21.376 --> 46:27.116
Fuck if I know, but you'll
be an A plus muff diver.

46:27.150 --> 46:28.117
OK.

46:28.150 --> 46:28.985
Stick out your tongue.

46:32.355 --> 46:34.190
Is this gonna hurt?

46:34.224 --> 46:37.460
Not if you hold still, fucker.

46:37.492 --> 46:39.895
Ow.

46:39.929 --> 46:40.831
Ow.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.365
What did I just say?

46:44.367 --> 46:46.369
Stick your tongue out.

46:46.402 --> 46:48.137
Here you go.

46:48.170 --> 46:49.839
OK.

46:49.873 --> 46:50.874
One.

46:50.907 --> 46:52.042
Two.

46:53.009 --> 46:54.945
Ahh!

46:57.347 --> 46:59.282
Ow!

46:59.315 --> 47:00.851
Hey, why are we yelling?

47:00.884 --> 47:02.219
Oh, nope.

47:02.251 --> 47:03.186
I don't like blood.

47:03.219 --> 47:04.186
No, no, no, no.

47:04.219 --> 47:05.154
No.

47:05.188 --> 47:08.090
What the fuck was that?

47:08.123 --> 47:09.458
Oh, man.

47:09.492 --> 47:11.294
We almost got it.

47:11.327 --> 47:13.096
What?
I'm done.

47:13.128 --> 47:14.029
That hurt.

47:14.063 --> 47:14.965
Yo, Ted.

47:14.998 --> 47:15.898
What's up?

47:15.931 --> 47:16.599
Yeah.

47:16.632 --> 47:17.933
We just got here.

47:17.967 --> 47:19.536
Oh, and I got a homie with me.

47:19.568 --> 47:20.469
Yeah.

47:20.503 --> 47:21.972
I'll be right up.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.939
Yeah.

47:22.972 --> 47:24.074
He said it was cool, man.

47:24.106 --> 47:25.442
All right.

47:25.474 --> 47:26.375
He know I'm here?

47:26.409 --> 47:27.244
Yeah.

47:30.947 --> 47:32.282
What the fuck was that?

47:32.315 --> 47:33.250
Argh.

47:33.282 --> 47:34.217
College kids.

47:34.250 --> 47:37.554
They do this all the time.

47:37.586 --> 47:39.056
Oh, shit.

47:43.492 --> 47:46.028
Pineapple, what the
hell is this shit?

47:46.061 --> 47:48.664
Argh.

47:48.697 --> 47:50.067
God damn nerds.

47:55.271 --> 47:56.539
Yeah, it's right here.

48:00.175 --> 48:03.078
Check out her special lot.

48:03.112 --> 48:04.447
God damn it.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.447
Come on.

48:05.481 --> 48:06.416
Jesus.

48:06.449 --> 48:09.351
Son of a b...

48:09.385 --> 48:10.420
Oh, hey.

48:10.452 --> 48:11.454
Come on in.

48:11.487 --> 48:12.456
Just threw in some bagel bites.

48:19.027 --> 48:20.462
So how you been, man?

48:20.496 --> 48:22.331
Pretty much incredible.

48:22.364 --> 48:24.700
Like, making bank nonstop
without even really

48:24.733 --> 48:26.936
trying, which is awesome.

48:26.969 --> 48:28.337
How about you, hot topic?

48:28.371 --> 48:32.142
Still, uh, living without
regret, or not so much?

48:32.175 --> 48:34.711
What's up with sugar smacks?

48:34.744 --> 48:36.112
Ah, man.

48:36.144 --> 48:37.380
He's cool.
He's with me.

48:37.413 --> 48:38.648
If you say so.

48:38.681 --> 48:40.317
I like your, uh, your place.

48:40.349 --> 48:41.217
It's cool.

48:41.250 --> 48:42.152
Yeah.

48:42.184 --> 48:43.353
It's pretty cool.

48:43.385 --> 48:45.255
What do you, um...

48:45.288 --> 48:47.523
what do you do with
all this stuff usually?

48:47.556 --> 48:50.326
eBay mostly on the deep web.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.260
Yeah.

48:51.293 --> 48:52.161
You name it.

48:52.195 --> 48:53.163
Devo Ted has got it.

48:53.195 --> 48:54.163
Yeah.

48:54.197 --> 48:55.597
You want illegal fireworks?

48:55.630 --> 48:57.433
I could take down Key Tower
with what I'm packing.

48:57.467 --> 48:58.367
Laffy taffy?

48:58.400 --> 49:00.002
Turkey jerky?

49:00.036 --> 49:02.304
I could choke out a bear
with what I got up in here.

49:02.338 --> 49:03.506
Energizing body wash?

49:03.539 --> 49:05.475
You won't sleep
for weeks, bitch.

49:08.677 --> 49:10.612
What is, what's this thing?

49:10.646 --> 49:12.615
Oh, that is the Flinger.

49:12.648 --> 49:14.451
It's a three-man water
balloon launcher.

49:14.483 --> 49:16.119
We used to mount
one to the window

49:16.152 --> 49:19.188
and launch canned hams
at my mom's boyfriends.

49:19.222 --> 49:20.690
The sound they made when
they hit the pavement

49:20.722 --> 49:23.092
was like a Hollywood punch.

49:23.126 --> 49:24.127
No way.

49:24.159 --> 49:25.494
You calling me a liar?

49:33.769 --> 49:35.038
Dime bad, right?

49:35.070 --> 49:38.040
Yeah, man.

49:38.074 --> 49:42.112
What's... what's "Dev-o?"

49:42.144 --> 49:43.679
"Dee-vo."

49:43.713 --> 49:45.448
Devo Ted.

49:45.481 --> 49:48.718
Devo, the seminal art punk
band that began one town over.

49:48.751 --> 49:49.753
That... that one.

49:49.786 --> 49:51.054
That's who you're talking about?

49:51.086 --> 49:52.489
Ring a bell?

49:52.521 --> 49:55.357
Oh, oh, I saw the thing
with the... the... the flower

49:55.391 --> 49:56.760
pots on their head.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.660
Dude.

49:57.693 --> 49:59.062
I'm sorry.

49:59.094 --> 50:00.696
Devo fans hate it
when you only know

50:00.730 --> 50:02.398
them from the "Whip It" video.

50:02.431 --> 50:04.033
I will fucking stab you.

50:04.067 --> 50:05.335
Yo.

50:05.367 --> 50:07.202
Then you can forget
about the bagel bites.

50:07.235 --> 50:08.137
Dude.

50:08.170 --> 50:09.239
We're going to bounce.

50:09.271 --> 50:10.472
Thanks, man.

50:10.505 --> 50:12.474
Wait, whoa, whoa,
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

50:12.507 --> 50:15.310
Slow down, Tokyo Drift.

50:15.344 --> 50:16.579
Cop a squat.

50:16.612 --> 50:17.514
Sit a spell.

50:17.547 --> 50:18.681
Oh.

50:18.713 --> 50:19.648
No, thanks.

50:19.681 --> 50:20.682
We've gotta go.

50:20.715 --> 50:21.585
We have an, we have an early.

50:31.226 --> 50:36.766
Not to shit on your
generation, but your generation

50:36.798 --> 50:39.302
basically sucks ass.

50:39.335 --> 50:42.172
It's like a bunch of zombies
staring at their video games

50:42.204 --> 50:43.405
or into their phones.
Hang on.

50:43.438 --> 50:44.440
I got a text message.

50:44.474 --> 50:46.409
I think it's Karen.

50:46.442 --> 50:50.280
We got doodads and
widgets of the wing wang.

50:50.313 --> 50:53.083
We've devolved as a species.

50:53.115 --> 50:57.820
That was Devo's whole
message, de-evolution.

50:57.853 --> 51:00.189
Their message is more
relevant today than ever.

51:00.222 --> 51:01.791
I mean, think about it.

51:01.824 --> 51:03.559
They go out on "Saturday Night
Live," and they're just like,

51:03.592 --> 51:05.861
wake the fuck up America.

51:05.894 --> 51:08.331
That was their whole thing.

51:08.364 --> 51:10.300
Freedom of choice.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.601
That's what we got.

51:11.634 --> 51:13.369
I mean, look at this fucker.

51:13.402 --> 51:16.106
Are you kidding me?

51:16.139 --> 51:19.742
I just realized your, your
hand, your hand tattoos.

51:19.775 --> 51:21.277
That's clever.

51:21.309 --> 51:22.813
The fuck is Celine Dion
talking about over here?

51:25.614 --> 51:26.882
You don't?

51:26.916 --> 51:29.219
Are you serious?

51:29.251 --> 51:30.853
What the fuck are
you talking about?

51:36.559 --> 51:37.560
Look.

51:37.592 --> 51:38.795
Put your hands together, dude.

51:38.827 --> 51:41.331
Devo Ted.

51:41.364 --> 51:42.331
Devoted.

51:42.364 --> 51:49.805
Holy... Devoted.

51:49.838 --> 51:51.141
How incredible is that?

51:51.173 --> 51:52.574
You've got to see
what my knuckles

51:52.608 --> 51:55.778
said, hiding in plain sight.

51:55.811 --> 51:58.780
You don't get stuff
like my new friend.

51:58.813 --> 52:01.384
Oh, God.

52:01.416 --> 52:05.487
That's cool.

52:05.521 --> 52:06.356
No idea.

52:18.733 --> 52:20.269
He's out.

52:20.302 --> 52:23.239
Let's go.

52:23.271 --> 52:24.641
Grab it.

52:24.673 --> 52:26.608
I'll be right back.

52:26.641 --> 52:28.210
Wait.

52:28.244 --> 52:30.579
That's his bedroom.

52:30.612 --> 52:31.947
What, no!

52:31.981 --> 52:33.416
Pineapple!

52:33.449 --> 52:36.186
He has a lot of cameras
and stuff in here.

52:36.219 --> 52:36.920
He won't even miss it.

52:39.688 --> 52:40.489
Jackpot.

52:43.259 --> 52:43.894
Let's go.

52:50.932 --> 52:52.367
Hurry up.
It's freezing.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.268
I got it.

52:53.302 --> 52:54.704
I got it.

52:54.737 --> 52:57.407
Spiral!

52:57.440 --> 52:59.208
How loud is this gonna be?

53:02.577 --> 53:03.547
That's so loud.

53:07.016 --> 53:09.686
This is awesome.

53:09.719 --> 53:10.920
Thank you, Devo Ted.

53:10.952 --> 53:13.590
Thanks, Devo Ted.

53:13.623 --> 53:14.691
We love you.

53:14.724 --> 53:16.226
Devo Ted.

53:16.259 --> 53:17.961
Devo Ted.

53:17.994 --> 53:20.430
De...

53:20.463 --> 53:21.364
Hi, ma.

53:21.396 --> 53:22.599
Hey.

53:22.632 --> 53:24.800
There's something

53:24.833 --> 53:26.501
that I want to tell you, right?

53:26.534 --> 53:32.007
Um, as much as I love you,
and I respect your opinions,

53:32.041 --> 53:35.411
I also know how, judgemental
you can be, and...

53:35.443 --> 53:36.913
God, I don't know
how to say this.

53:36.945 --> 53:38.413
Um, I just... what the fuck?

53:38.447 --> 53:39.349
Dude.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.617
Your son's a homo.

53:40.650 --> 53:41.550
Yeah.

53:41.583 --> 53:43.385
Homo.

53:43.418 --> 53:46.521
Oh, you knew?

53:46.554 --> 53:49.024
Yeah, this is Pineapple.

53:49.057 --> 53:50.960
Yeah, that's my name.

53:50.992 --> 53:51.827
Just like the fruit.

53:53.862 --> 53:54.864
Yeah.

53:54.896 --> 53:55.831
Justin's gonna be OK, you know?

54:09.545 --> 54:11.380
What did you say to them?

54:11.414 --> 54:13.049
Your parents are rad.

54:13.081 --> 54:14.817
We got a lunch date next week.

54:14.849 --> 54:16.518
Well, you have to come out
to celebrate with us tonight.

54:16.552 --> 54:17.954
Oh, yeah.

54:17.987 --> 54:19.055
It's our friend Eric's
birthday, or his roommate's.

54:19.088 --> 54:20.456
I don't remember.

54:20.489 --> 54:21.590
Either way, the point
is it's a party.

54:21.623 --> 54:22.924
And this bitch
is getting crunk.

54:22.958 --> 54:24.726
Woo.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.462
Got to work, sorry.

54:26.494 --> 54:27.797
Oh, you suck.

54:27.829 --> 54:30.365
Let me know if you guys
need a ride later on.

54:30.398 --> 54:32.301
Go to the party.

54:32.335 --> 54:33.936
What about the bus?

54:33.969 --> 54:35.070
- I'll handle the bus.
- All right.

54:35.103 --> 54:35.971
Tick-tock, ladies.

54:36.005 --> 54:37.539
Go ahead without me.

54:37.572 --> 54:38.974
- I'll catch up.
- OK.

54:39.007 --> 54:40.475
Bye.

54:40.509 --> 54:42.778
If Fred finds out,
I'm gonna lose my job.

54:42.811 --> 54:44.614
Who the fuck cares?

54:44.646 --> 54:45.547
I care.

54:45.581 --> 54:47.517
Do you?

54:47.550 --> 54:49.818
Do you really care if you
lose this lame ass job?

54:49.851 --> 54:51.019
All right.
You know what?

54:51.052 --> 54:52.020
Actually, I'm going to run.

54:52.054 --> 54:52.889
I'll see you.

54:56.925 --> 55:00.395
Bitch.

55:00.429 --> 55:01.331
Fine.

55:04.367 --> 55:06.035
You sure you can
handle her on your own?

55:11.606 --> 55:12.509
Kat, wait up.

55:22.885 --> 55:25.355
So how's your, uh, how's
your museum project going?

55:25.387 --> 55:27.123
It's all right.

55:27.155 --> 55:29.092
It'll come together,
or it won't.

55:29.125 --> 55:30.992
I don't know.

55:31.025 --> 55:34.096
Either way, I just, I
don't wanna think about it.

55:34.130 --> 55:35.731
Sorry.
Am I keeping you up?

55:35.764 --> 55:36.766
Uh, no.

55:36.798 --> 55:38.668
No, sorry, uh, Night Tara is.

55:38.701 --> 55:39.635
Ha.

55:39.668 --> 55:40.737
She was brutal last night.

55:45.007 --> 55:46.476
How do you do that?

56:13.101 --> 56:14.069
Of course.

56:14.103 --> 56:14.938
Of course.

56:21.543 --> 56:22.778
Hey, hey.

56:22.811 --> 56:24.746
Drunk bus.

56:24.780 --> 56:27.884
Someone get this guy a beer.

56:27.916 --> 56:30.652
Do you know these people?

56:30.686 --> 56:33.423
Your boyfriend,
he saved my life.

56:33.456 --> 56:37.160
Probably just doing
my, my job or whatever.

56:37.193 --> 56:38.428
Hey, hey.

56:38.460 --> 56:39.161
You made it.

56:39.195 --> 56:40.062
Wait.

56:40.094 --> 56:40.996
Who's driving the bus?

57:06.054 --> 57:07.556
Drunk bus!

57:22.637 --> 57:24.606
Great shot, kid.

57:24.639 --> 57:25.607
One in a million.

57:25.641 --> 57:26.809
Two people who love Star Wars.

57:26.842 --> 57:27.844
What are the odds?

57:27.876 --> 57:29.679
Never tell me the odds.

57:29.711 --> 57:31.980
Happy birthday...

57:32.014 --> 57:34.182
I forgot this was
a birthday thing.

57:34.215 --> 57:35.550
Me too.

57:35.583 --> 57:39.621
Happy
birthday to you.

57:39.655 --> 57:45.194
Happy birthday dear Todd.

57:45.226 --> 57:51.067
Happy birthday to you.

57:51.099 --> 57:53.702
You're all the friends
I never fucking wanted.

57:53.735 --> 57:54.636
I mean that.

57:54.670 --> 57:56.873
Now let's get fucked up!

58:20.195 --> 58:22.798
What the fuck are you
doing here, bus bitch?

58:28.137 --> 58:30.573
Ow!

58:30.606 --> 58:31.741
Ow!
Fuck!

58:31.773 --> 58:32.674
Ow!

58:32.708 --> 58:34.309
My fucking nose.

58:34.342 --> 58:35.545
It hurts so bad.

58:35.577 --> 58:36.579
Yo.

58:36.612 --> 58:37.313
What did you do to my boy, Todd?

58:37.346 --> 58:39.014
My fucking nose.

58:39.047 --> 58:40.115
My f... Ow!

58:40.148 --> 58:40.983
Fuck!

58:45.788 --> 58:47.322
Pick me up.

58:47.356 --> 58:49.191
Fucking bitch.

58:49.224 --> 58:50.726
Get me out.

58:50.759 --> 58:53.829
Get me outta here Take
me fucking outta here.

58:53.862 --> 58:55.764
Get me the fuck outta here.

59:29.764 --> 59:31.766
How'd you figure
out the marquee?

59:31.800 --> 59:34.704
I've got mad skills, homie.

59:34.737 --> 59:35.771
Holy shit.

59:35.804 --> 59:36.939
What happened to your face?

59:36.972 --> 59:39.775
I ran into Todd with my head.

59:39.807 --> 59:41.577
Oh, awesome.

59:44.246 --> 59:47.148
So how was it, killer?

59:47.181 --> 59:48.850
It fucking hurts.

59:48.884 --> 59:51.253
It hurts so bad.

59:51.286 --> 59:52.855
How do you do that?

59:52.887 --> 59:54.690
You're supposed to use
your head, not your face.

59:54.722 --> 59:55.724
I broke his nose.

59:55.757 --> 59:56.625
Oh.

59:56.659 --> 59:57.393
Fuck yeah.

59:57.425 --> 59:58.960
Ah, come on, dude.

59:58.994 --> 1:00:01.931
Fuck chop nothing
to fuck with.

1:00:01.963 --> 1:00:05.400
Kat got all freaked out.

1:00:05.434 --> 1:00:06.902
Everyone else got
all freaked out.

1:00:06.934 --> 1:00:08.938
It was awful.

1:00:08.971 --> 1:00:10.206
Ah.

1:00:10.239 --> 1:00:12.675
Don't worry about that, man.

1:00:12.708 --> 1:00:14.677
At least you'll have a
kickass story about that scar.

1:00:20.114 --> 1:00:21.850
You're going to need
stitches, homie.

1:00:21.884 --> 1:00:24.186
I'd do it myself, but I
ain't got anything on me.

1:00:24.219 --> 1:00:25.954
Hey.

1:00:25.987 --> 1:00:30.158
Totally interrupting, um, I
could do you back in my place.

1:00:30.192 --> 1:00:31.092
Uh, sorry.

1:00:33.461 --> 1:00:36.065
I'm a nursing major,
so I could stitch

1:00:36.097 --> 1:00:37.766
you up if you want skip the ER.

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.735
No, I'm good, thanks.

1:00:39.768 --> 1:00:41.670
Cool.

1:00:41.704 --> 1:00:43.839
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1:00:43.871 --> 1:00:44.773
Shh.

1:00:44.806 --> 1:00:45.907
Dude.

1:00:45.940 --> 1:00:47.108
I just want this
night to be over.

1:00:47.141 --> 1:00:48.143
Do you want to be
a virgin forever?

1:00:48.177 --> 1:00:49.045
Shh.

1:00:49.077 --> 1:00:50.211
Come on.

1:00:50.244 --> 1:00:51.713
Shh.

1:00:51.746 --> 1:00:53.014
I don't even know this girl.

1:00:53.047 --> 1:00:54.716
She doesn't really seem
like my type either.

1:00:54.750 --> 1:00:57.318
Virgins don't have types.

1:00:57.351 --> 1:01:00.288
Now, listen, you're going
to go back with that girl.

1:01:00.322 --> 1:01:03.459
She's going to stitch
your face, and then she's

1:01:03.492 --> 1:01:06.896
going to sit on your face.

1:01:06.929 --> 1:01:09.197
And listen, when
you're doing it,

1:01:09.231 --> 1:01:10.800
focus on something in
the room, all right?

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.768
You don't want to blow
your wad too soon.

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:13.802
Hey.

1:01:13.835 --> 1:01:15.704
Seriously, let me look at that.

1:01:15.737 --> 1:01:16.338
Come here.

1:01:22.411 --> 1:01:23.311
What'd you do?

1:01:26.481 --> 1:01:27.349
See.

1:01:27.382 --> 1:01:29.251
It's not so bad, right?

1:01:29.284 --> 1:01:31.921
Imagine how good I'd be if
I didn't have any beers.

1:01:31.954 --> 1:01:32.855
What?

1:01:32.887 --> 1:01:33.788
I'm joking.

1:01:33.822 --> 1:01:35.458
I only had four.

1:01:35.490 --> 1:01:39.394
Oh, right.

1:01:39.427 --> 1:01:42.498
So you like Sister Oblivion?

1:01:42.530 --> 1:01:44.467
Yeah.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.168
Hank's my fave.

1:01:46.201 --> 1:01:48.369
I used to be into
crap like that?

1:01:48.402 --> 1:01:49.838
Yeah?

1:01:49.871 --> 1:01:51.339
Like what?

1:01:51.373 --> 1:01:54.342
Photography, sort of.

1:01:54.376 --> 1:01:55.277
Cool.

1:01:55.309 --> 1:01:56.445
What kind?

1:01:56.478 --> 1:01:59.181
Just Polaroids, but
my camera broke.

1:01:59.213 --> 1:02:01.083
I never fixed it.

1:02:01.115 --> 1:02:03.018
Why not?

1:02:03.050 --> 1:02:04.353
Oh.

1:02:04.385 --> 1:02:05.820
I don't know.

1:02:05.853 --> 1:02:06.955
I don't why.

1:02:06.989 --> 1:02:08.289
I just didn't feel
like doing it...

1:02:08.322 --> 1:02:10.291
Sounds like you're depressed.

1:02:10.324 --> 1:02:11.760
Ow.
Ow.

1:02:11.793 --> 1:02:12.193
Oh.
Sorry.

1:02:12.226 --> 1:02:14.797
Sorry.

1:02:14.829 --> 1:02:18.099
I don't feel depressed really.

1:02:18.132 --> 1:02:19.400
None?

1:02:19.434 --> 1:02:20.836
Yeah.

1:02:20.869 --> 1:02:21.836
Oh.

1:02:21.869 --> 1:02:23.204
Good?

1:02:23.237 --> 1:02:24.740
All better.

1:02:43.090 --> 1:02:46.795
All right, so I'm on the
pill, but I won't be offended

1:02:46.829 --> 1:02:48.230
if you use a condom, OK?

1:02:48.262 --> 1:02:49.766
Oh, um, OK.

1:02:57.438 --> 1:02:58.373
You cold?

1:02:58.407 --> 1:02:59.307
What?

1:02:59.340 --> 1:03:00.509
No.

1:03:00.541 --> 1:03:01.442
Why?

1:03:01.476 --> 1:03:03.979
'Cause you're shaking.

1:03:04.012 --> 1:03:04.914
So good.

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:05.548
OK.

1:03:17.425 --> 1:03:19.295
Did you just come?

1:03:24.398 --> 1:03:27.068
I, I'm so, I'm, I'm so sorry.

1:03:27.101 --> 1:03:28.403
It's OK.

1:03:28.436 --> 1:03:31.873
Just finger bang me, and
we can try again later.

1:03:31.907 --> 1:03:32.975
Oh, OK.

1:03:38.313 --> 1:03:40.015
- Li... like that?
- Yeah, but shh.

1:03:40.047 --> 1:03:40.982
Shut up.

1:03:41.016 --> 1:03:41.983
Sorry.

1:03:42.016 --> 1:03:44.953
Shh.

1:04:03.170 --> 1:04:04.505
I want you inside me.

1:04:04.539 --> 1:04:05.441
What?

1:04:08.510 --> 1:04:09.412
Are you OK?

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:19.454
Remember to focus
on something in the room, yo.

1:04:27.061 --> 1:04:30.632
Fornicate this woman.

1:04:30.666 --> 1:04:33.903
She needs you.

1:04:33.936 --> 1:04:36.438
Yeah.

1:04:36.471 --> 1:04:37.373
Yeah.

1:04:37.405 --> 1:04:38.273
This feels great.

1:04:38.306 --> 1:04:39.641
That feels so good.

1:04:39.675 --> 1:04:40.576
Yeah.

1:04:40.608 --> 1:04:41.911
That feels so good.

1:04:41.943 --> 1:04:43.112
Too much.

1:04:43.144 --> 1:04:44.246
Too much, no.

1:04:52.487 --> 1:04:56.125
Are you OK?

1:04:56.157 --> 1:04:57.125
Yeah.

1:04:57.159 --> 1:04:58.027
What?

1:04:58.059 --> 1:05:00.429
Do it just like that.

1:05:00.461 --> 1:05:02.398
Shut up!

1:05:02.431 --> 1:05:05.266
Tell them to fuck off.

1:05:05.300 --> 1:05:06.568
Fuck off.

1:05:06.601 --> 1:05:07.436
Yeah.

1:05:10.706 --> 1:05:13.075
Why are you doing this to me?

1:05:13.108 --> 1:05:15.044
Say my name.

1:05:15.077 --> 1:05:16.078
Say my name.

1:05:24.418 --> 1:05:25.554
Tara.

1:05:25.586 --> 1:05:26.554
Shut the fuck up.

1:05:26.588 --> 1:05:28.157
I'm trying to sleep.

1:05:28.190 --> 1:05:29.557
Tara?

1:05:29.590 --> 1:05:31.527
She's Night... she's Night...

1:05:31.559 --> 1:05:32.460
Night Tara?

1:05:56.385 --> 1:05:57.353
You're an asshole.

1:06:05.659 --> 1:06:06.627
Sorry.

1:06:06.661 --> 1:06:07.628
Didn't mean to wake you.

1:07:38.519 --> 1:07:39.487
Coming.

1:07:39.521 --> 1:07:40.489
My God.

1:07:40.521 --> 1:07:41.423
I'm sick of this.

1:07:44.492 --> 1:07:45.360
Just you?

1:07:45.393 --> 1:07:46.228
Yeah.

1:07:58.639 --> 1:08:01.576
Dime bag, right?

1:08:01.610 --> 1:08:03.612
The hell happened to your face?

1:08:03.644 --> 1:08:05.514
You don't wanna know.

1:08:05.547 --> 1:08:07.382
Looks like Pineapple's work.

1:08:07.414 --> 1:08:08.349
Yeah.

1:08:08.382 --> 1:08:11.552
Kind of.

1:08:11.585 --> 1:08:15.623
So whose idea
was the fireworks?

1:08:15.657 --> 1:08:16.891
Yeah.

1:08:16.925 --> 1:08:19.261
I know about that,
you little shit ball.

1:08:19.293 --> 1:08:20.761
It was Pine's idea, wasn't it?

1:08:20.795 --> 1:08:23.532
You can't trust that dude
as far as you can throw him.

1:08:23.564 --> 1:08:25.366
He's probably been telling
you all sorts of shit

1:08:25.399 --> 1:08:27.402
about Samoa, too.

1:08:27.435 --> 1:08:28.537
What?

1:08:28.569 --> 1:08:31.439
He's from Buffalo.

1:08:31.472 --> 1:08:33.141
I think one of his
grandparents might

1:08:33.175 --> 1:08:37.613
have lived in Samoa or New
Zealand a million years ago.

1:08:37.645 --> 1:08:38.679
What?

1:08:38.712 --> 1:08:39.648
What are you talking about?

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.449
Ask him.

1:08:41.483 --> 1:08:45.287
He didn't get those tattoos in
some ancient island ceremony.

1:08:45.319 --> 1:08:47.588
He got them at
Show Us Your Tats.

1:08:47.622 --> 1:08:51.193
It's like the Supercuts
of tattoo parlors.

1:08:51.225 --> 1:08:54.195
I don't even think he's
seen an ocean up close.

1:08:54.229 --> 1:08:56.765
Wha... no.

1:08:56.797 --> 1:08:58.466
Why would he lie about that?

1:08:58.500 --> 1:08:59.635
Look.

1:08:59.667 --> 1:09:02.170
Everyone's got
their reasons, man.

1:09:02.203 --> 1:09:03.938
Looking like he does,
he gets to be special.

1:09:03.971 --> 1:09:07.475
He gets to be Pineapple,
the punk rock Samoan.

1:09:07.509 --> 1:09:10.578
When deep down inside, he
knows he'll always basically

1:09:10.612 --> 1:09:13.748
be Greg, the deadbeat
dad, the nursing

1:09:13.782 --> 1:09:16.818
school dropout from Buffalo.

1:09:16.850 --> 1:09:18.353
No.

1:09:18.386 --> 1:09:20.522
He se... he sends money
to his kid every week.

1:09:20.555 --> 1:09:24.592
Yeah, and I got a
9-foot dingle dangle.

1:09:24.626 --> 1:09:25.561
Here.

1:09:25.594 --> 1:09:26.828
It's on our mutual friend.

1:09:34.336 --> 1:09:36.605
Well, I'm going to go.

1:09:36.637 --> 1:09:37.672
Uh, whoa, whoa.

1:09:37.706 --> 1:09:38.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:39.541
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1:09:39.573 --> 1:09:40.576
Ah.

1:09:40.609 --> 1:09:42.945
I can make us some bagel bites.

1:09:42.978 --> 1:09:44.813
Bagel bites sound good?

1:09:44.845 --> 1:09:48.316
It's like a small bagel
pizza..

1:09:48.350 --> 1:09:49.818
It's nice.

1:09:49.850 --> 1:09:50.751
All right.

1:09:50.784 --> 1:09:51.653
I thought so.

1:09:51.685 --> 1:09:53.889
That's my guy.

1:09:53.921 --> 1:09:56.557
You remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age.

1:09:56.591 --> 1:09:59.328
I didn't always have
my shit together.

1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:00.595
Yeah.

1:10:00.628 --> 1:10:02.997
They'll tell you to
graduate, get a job,

1:10:03.030 --> 1:10:08.569
marry within or above your
socioeconomic bracket.

1:10:08.603 --> 1:10:11.440
Next thing you know, you're
saddled with a mortgage,

1:10:11.472 --> 1:10:13.708
and you're passing all this
shit your dad laid on to you

1:10:13.742 --> 1:10:16.244
on to your own kid.

1:10:16.278 --> 1:10:17.412
The American dream.

1:10:17.444 --> 1:10:20.282
Just add water.

1:10:20.314 --> 1:10:21.716
Oh, fuck the world.

1:10:30.524 --> 1:10:33.862
So how was it last night?

1:10:33.895 --> 1:10:36.398
Oh, it was great.

1:10:36.430 --> 1:10:38.933
Woke up in the middle of the
night with her on top of me.

1:10:38.966 --> 1:10:40.469
One minute we're doing
it, the next she's

1:10:40.502 --> 1:10:42.804
scratching and flailing
around in my face,

1:10:42.837 --> 1:10:45.340
screaming like a
fucking psycho person.

1:10:45.372 --> 1:10:47.475
Freaky deaky.

1:10:47.509 --> 1:10:48.577
Freaky.

1:10:48.609 --> 1:10:49.543
Felony.

1:10:49.577 --> 1:10:50.412
Who's to say?

1:10:58.819 --> 1:11:00.421
Bob, will you get on the bus?

1:11:00.454 --> 1:11:02.923
It's freezing.

1:11:02.957 --> 1:11:04.426
Damn.

1:11:04.458 --> 1:11:05.860
Dude doesn't give a fuck.

1:11:05.894 --> 1:11:09.530
Bob, will you just
get on the bus, please?

1:11:09.564 --> 1:11:11.733
Fuck you.

1:11:11.765 --> 1:11:13.301
You know what?

1:11:13.335 --> 1:11:14.869
Fuck you, Bob.

1:11:14.903 --> 1:11:16.605
I think this is all an act.

1:11:16.637 --> 1:11:17.905
Do you hear me?

1:11:17.939 --> 1:11:20.809
If I'm wrong, tell me different.

1:11:20.841 --> 1:11:21.809
I'm not buying it anymore.

1:11:21.842 --> 1:11:22.711
Dude.

1:11:22.743 --> 1:11:23.944
Lay off.

1:11:23.978 --> 1:11:24.880
Give him a break.

1:11:24.912 --> 1:11:26.414
No.

1:11:26.448 --> 1:11:27.816
You know, I think he's
a fucking liar like you.

1:11:27.849 --> 1:11:28.949
What?

1:11:28.983 --> 1:11:30.485
If I'm wrong,
tell me I'm wrong.

1:11:41.563 --> 1:11:42.431
Fuck you.

1:11:45.899 --> 1:11:46.867
You know what?

1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:48.369
I'm done with this guy.

1:12:08.088 --> 1:12:09.957
Yo.

1:12:09.990 --> 1:12:11.926
You going to tell me why you
called me a liar or what?

1:12:15.764 --> 1:12:17.532
Give me the phone, Pineapple.

1:12:17.564 --> 1:12:19.433
You're texting Amy?

1:12:19.466 --> 1:12:20.469
Come on.

1:12:20.502 --> 1:12:21.837
Give me my phone now, please.

1:12:21.869 --> 1:12:22.738
No.

1:12:22.770 --> 1:12:25.773
You can't be trusted.

1:12:25.806 --> 1:12:27.943
You want to talk about trust?

1:12:27.975 --> 1:12:29.710
You pressured me to
go to that party,

1:12:29.743 --> 1:12:31.579
which was a complete disaster.

1:12:31.613 --> 1:12:33.081
Then you tell me that
I need to get laid,

1:12:33.113 --> 1:12:35.149
which is an even
bigger disaster.

1:12:35.182 --> 1:12:36.984
I didn't hold a
gun to your head.

1:12:37.018 --> 1:12:38.587
God.

1:12:38.619 --> 1:12:40.956
You're just this massive
pile of walking bullshit,

1:12:40.988 --> 1:12:43.391
and you tell me to make
decisions and do things.

1:12:43.425 --> 1:12:45.427
You don't fucking do anything.

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:46.595
You could be saving
lives, but you

1:12:46.627 --> 1:12:49.096
just fuck around and get high.

1:12:49.130 --> 1:12:51.666
In Samoa, there's a saying.

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:55.069
Shut the fuck up.

1:12:55.103 --> 1:12:56.538
- No one cares.
- No.

1:12:56.570 --> 1:12:57.372
You're wrong.

1:13:01.443 --> 1:13:03.078
You're not even from Samoa.

1:13:03.110 --> 1:13:04.779
You've never even been there.

1:13:04.813 --> 1:13:07.047
Who told you that?

1:13:07.081 --> 1:13:08.115
Let me guess.

1:13:08.149 --> 1:13:10.852
It was Devo Ted, wasn't it?

1:13:10.885 --> 1:13:12.788
That mother fucker
is responsible for...

1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:13.988
Oh.

1:13:14.021 --> 1:13:15.689
What do you know
about responsibility?

1:13:15.722 --> 1:13:17.958
Plenty.

1:13:17.992 --> 1:13:19.927
That's not what I heard.

1:13:19.961 --> 1:13:23.164
What'd you hear?

1:13:23.198 --> 1:13:24.900
Just give me my phone.

1:13:24.932 --> 1:13:27.702
Give me my phone,
and I'll tell you.

1:13:27.734 --> 1:13:30.572
What'd you hear?

1:13:30.604 --> 1:13:31.505
Yo.

1:13:31.538 --> 1:13:32.541
Dick.

1:13:32.573 --> 1:13:33.808
What'd you hear?

1:13:33.841 --> 1:13:35.576
That you're a fucking
deadbeat dad, OK?

1:13:39.814 --> 1:13:41.483
What the hell, man?

1:13:41.515 --> 1:13:48.723
What the... Pine, stop.

1:13:51.693 --> 1:13:54.796
You want to lecture
me about responsibility?

1:13:54.828 --> 1:13:58.500
Try working two fucking
jobs, living in a shithole

1:13:58.533 --> 1:14:00.101
just so my kid could eat.

1:14:00.134 --> 1:14:04.605
I may not be first generation
Samoan, but I love my daughter!

1:14:04.639 --> 1:14:05.440
OK.

1:14:13.614 --> 1:14:14.782
I don't need this.

1:14:48.015 --> 1:14:49.149
Look.

1:14:49.182 --> 1:14:50.051
I know about Todd.

1:14:50.083 --> 1:14:51.552
Who?

1:14:51.586 --> 1:14:55.023
The guy that
you had sex with.

1:14:55.055 --> 1:14:57.192
Is he a Ginger?

1:14:57.225 --> 1:14:58.126
Yes.

1:14:58.158 --> 1:14:59.728
OK.

1:14:59.761 --> 1:15:01.930
So we, we talked once at
a party after we broke up,

1:15:01.962 --> 1:15:03.697
but that was it.

1:15:03.730 --> 1:15:05.800
You seriously think I would
lose my virginity to a stranger?

1:15:09.737 --> 1:15:10.639
Look.

1:15:10.671 --> 1:15:13.974
I... I felt so bad.

1:15:14.007 --> 1:15:17.878
I... I feel so bad about
what happened with us.

1:15:17.912 --> 1:15:20.115
Michael, I knew you were never
going to move to New York.

1:15:20.148 --> 1:15:21.716
You never asked me.

1:15:21.748 --> 1:15:22.650
Come on.

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:24.753
Be real.

1:15:24.786 --> 1:15:26.621
You're terrified of the
unknown, and you can't make

1:15:26.654 --> 1:15:28.156
a decision to save your life.

1:15:28.189 --> 1:15:30.225
That's not true.

1:15:30.257 --> 1:15:33.060
Uh, when you texted
me back, how long did it

1:15:33.094 --> 1:15:36.765
take you to actually hit send?

1:15:36.797 --> 1:15:39.233
It's who you are, and that's OK.

1:15:39.266 --> 1:15:40.268
You would have hated New York.

1:15:40.301 --> 1:15:42.637
It's not for everyone.

1:15:42.670 --> 1:15:43.771
Not even me.

1:15:43.805 --> 1:15:45.574
I thought you loved it there.

1:15:45.606 --> 1:15:48.009
I did.

1:15:48.042 --> 1:15:54.950
I did, but everyone and
everything moves so fast,

1:15:54.983 --> 1:15:56.650
and I missed home.

1:15:56.684 --> 1:15:58.587
And I missed you.

1:16:02.055 --> 1:16:03.924
And I got fired.

1:16:03.957 --> 1:16:04.960
Yeah.

1:16:04.993 --> 1:16:07.162
I didn't want anyone to know.

1:16:07.194 --> 1:16:10.064
It's been a rough couple
of months actually.

1:16:10.097 --> 1:16:15.136
So with my tail tucked between
my legs, I am moving back.

1:16:18.706 --> 1:16:20.141
So I've got a
couple of job leads,

1:16:20.173 --> 1:16:21.376
and my parents
are going to float

1:16:21.408 --> 1:16:22.710
me till I get back on my feet.

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:27.916
Are you going to make me say it?

1:16:27.948 --> 1:16:30.951
Say what?

1:16:30.984 --> 1:16:36.390
I was hoping we could
pick up where we left off.

1:16:36.423 --> 1:16:39.894
Where we left off was
you breaking my heart

1:16:39.926 --> 1:16:41.328
and fucking another guy.

1:16:41.362 --> 1:16:45.233
I just said that
that wasn't true.

1:16:45.265 --> 1:16:48.168
I'm serious about
setting down roots.

1:16:48.202 --> 1:16:50.606
You know, here with you.

1:16:55.076 --> 1:16:57.811
And I've given it
a lot of thought,

1:16:57.845 --> 1:17:00.615
and I think we should have sex.

1:17:03.885 --> 1:17:05.686
Not, not like now.

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:06.421
I know.

1:17:06.453 --> 1:17:07.721
But yeah.

1:17:07.755 --> 1:17:09.757
Soon.

1:17:09.791 --> 1:17:14.095
I can be at the Student
Center tomorrow around 11:30.

1:17:14.127 --> 1:17:16.398
If you want some
company on the loop.

1:17:16.430 --> 1:17:19.366
I can bring an overnight bag.

1:17:19.399 --> 1:17:21.869
Oh.

1:17:21.903 --> 1:17:26.274
What about, like,
the... the... the Lord?

1:17:26.306 --> 1:17:27.207
Oh.

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:28.342
Yeah.

1:17:28.376 --> 1:17:30.412
I've, I've thought
about that too.

1:17:30.444 --> 1:17:34.682
I think He would prefer that we
do it than with some strangers.

1:17:34.716 --> 1:17:36.218
Especially, you know,
since we're back together.

1:17:39.119 --> 1:17:41.390
Are we back together?

1:18:05.512 --> 1:18:07.849
Hey,
you sitting down?

1:18:07.881 --> 1:18:08.750
Yeah.

1:18:08.783 --> 1:18:10.485
I'm driving.

1:18:10.518 --> 1:18:12.886
- I
- just got some bad news.

1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:14.855
You're sitting, right?

1:18:14.889 --> 1:18:17.958
Fred, I'm really
not in the mood.

1:18:17.992 --> 1:18:19.994
Fuck You Bob.

1:18:20.027 --> 1:18:22.297
He died last night.

1:18:22.329 --> 1:18:24.231
They found the poor
guy frozen to death

1:18:24.265 --> 1:18:27.235
like a bearded Popsicle
on the side of the road.

1:18:27.268 --> 1:18:30.270
The battery in his
wheelchair must've gave out.

1:18:30.304 --> 1:18:32.740
Guy had no family.

1:18:32.774 --> 1:18:35.243
It's a real shame.

1:18:35.275 --> 1:18:36.377
Circle of life, I suppose.

1:18:46.052 --> 1:18:49.157
Everyone, get off the bus.

1:18:49.189 --> 1:18:50.157
Get off the bus now.

1:18:50.190 --> 1:18:51.091
I'm not kidding.

1:18:51.125 --> 1:18:53.427
Get off my bus.

1:18:53.461 --> 1:18:54.496
Sorry, yeah.

1:18:54.529 --> 1:18:56.164
Get off the bus.

1:18:56.197 --> 1:18:57.298
This god damn kid.

1:19:01.868 --> 1:19:02.804
Ah!

1:19:02.837 --> 1:19:04.106
Get off the bus!

1:19:07.908 --> 1:19:08.777
What are you?

1:19:08.810 --> 1:19:09.511
A zombie?

1:19:09.543 --> 1:19:12.479
Get off the fucking bus!

1:19:12.512 --> 1:19:14.181
Are you on or off?

1:19:14.215 --> 1:19:18.119
I want to see
how this plays out.

1:19:18.152 --> 1:19:18.953
Where are we?

1:19:40.841 --> 1:19:41.509
Damn it!

1:19:44.612 --> 1:19:47.382
Why would I leave him
out there like that?

1:19:47.414 --> 1:19:48.884
I'm so stupid.

1:19:53.287 --> 1:19:55.390
Uh, this is all my fault.

1:19:55.422 --> 1:19:58.492
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1:19:58.525 --> 1:20:00.028
Dude was old as fuck.

1:20:00.060 --> 1:20:01.195
This is not a joke.

1:20:01.229 --> 1:20:02.497
I'm talking about
someone's life.

1:20:02.529 --> 1:20:03.398
Yeah.

1:20:03.430 --> 1:20:04.364
It was his choice.

1:20:04.398 --> 1:20:05.600
He decided that.

1:20:05.632 --> 1:20:07.202
Now what the fuck
are we doing here?

1:20:11.072 --> 1:20:11.972
I don't know.

1:20:12.006 --> 1:20:14.209
I just... I...

1:20:14.242 --> 1:20:17.512
I know nothing about
the guy, and now...

1:20:17.545 --> 1:20:18.846
and now he's dead because of me.

1:20:21.582 --> 1:20:24.018
Look.

1:20:24.051 --> 1:20:28.189
Maybe Fuck You Bob was Fuck You
Bob just to get through life.

1:20:28.221 --> 1:20:30.057
You know, some of us lie.

1:20:30.091 --> 1:20:32.994
Some of us say fuck
you to everybody.

1:20:33.027 --> 1:20:34.395
Some of us drive
around in circles.

1:20:34.427 --> 1:20:35.262
You feel me?

1:20:39.966 --> 1:20:43.003
All right?

1:20:43.037 --> 1:20:43.905
OK.

1:20:43.938 --> 1:20:44.573
Move.

1:21:36.256 --> 1:21:37.591
Yo, dude.

1:21:37.625 --> 1:21:38.426
Come over here.

1:22:02.382 --> 1:22:04.118
Did he do all
this from memory?

1:22:15.529 --> 1:22:19.033
Holy shit.

1:22:19.065 --> 1:22:19.733
Yo.

1:22:19.766 --> 1:22:20.601
Check this out.

1:22:39.119 --> 1:22:42.489
Your nipple looks
like a ball sack.

1:22:42.523 --> 1:22:45.092
That's accurate.

1:22:45.126 --> 1:22:47.595
Man, Fuck You Bob
was one sick puppy.

1:22:47.627 --> 1:22:50.163
He had a name.

1:22:50.197 --> 1:22:52.100
Robert Birch.

1:22:52.132 --> 1:22:55.269
I like Fuck You Bob better.

1:22:55.301 --> 1:22:57.572
Man, I wonder what's going
to happen to all of these.

1:22:57.604 --> 1:22:59.439
He had no family, right?

1:22:59.472 --> 1:23:01.242
I don't know.

1:23:01.274 --> 1:23:06.279
I'm guessing the state of the
school's going to toss it all.

1:23:06.313 --> 1:23:08.016
Man, fuck that.

1:23:10.751 --> 1:23:11.652
Yeah.

1:23:11.685 --> 1:23:12.553
You know what?

1:23:12.586 --> 1:23:13.488
Fuck that.

1:23:24.765 --> 1:23:26.300
Hey, come here.

1:23:26.332 --> 1:23:27.768
Oh, my God.

1:23:27.801 --> 1:23:30.170
What do you want?

1:23:30.203 --> 1:23:31.104
Just come here.

1:23:31.137 --> 1:23:32.707
We're busy.

1:23:32.739 --> 1:23:33.707
What?

1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:36.210
I said we're fucking busy.

1:23:36.243 --> 1:23:38.112
Doing what?

1:23:38.145 --> 1:23:39.814
What do you want?

1:23:39.846 --> 1:23:42.149
I got to show you something.

1:23:42.182 --> 1:23:44.519
What is it?

1:23:44.551 --> 1:23:46.353
Just ca... can you come here?

1:23:46.386 --> 1:23:47.387
Can you trust me, please?

1:23:47.421 --> 1:23:48.722
Can you do that?

1:23:48.756 --> 1:23:51.426
You're not gonna smash
our faces in, are you?

1:23:51.458 --> 1:23:53.360
No.

1:23:53.394 --> 1:23:57.298
I promise I will not
smash your faces.

1:23:57.331 --> 1:23:59.167
He shouldn't have to say it.

1:24:03.170 --> 1:24:05.840
All right.

1:24:05.872 --> 1:24:07.341
We got nothing
better to do anyway.

1:24:11.345 --> 1:24:14.248
This is...

1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:16.216
It's beautiful.

1:24:16.250 --> 1:24:17.318
Who did this?

1:24:17.350 --> 1:24:18.251
Robert Birch.

1:24:18.284 --> 1:24:19.353
Who?

1:24:19.386 --> 1:24:20.688
Fuck You Bob.

1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:21.755
- He died last night.
- Wait.

1:24:21.788 --> 1:24:22.657
Are you serious?

1:24:22.689 --> 1:24:24.391
What?

1:24:24.425 --> 1:24:26.327
We found his place, and we
found all of his paintings.

1:24:26.359 --> 1:24:27.795
He wasn't an ass...

1:24:27.828 --> 1:24:31.099
I mean, he was an asshole,
but he was an artist too.

1:24:31.131 --> 1:24:32.299
What about you?

1:24:32.332 --> 1:24:33.233
What?

1:24:33.266 --> 1:24:34.269
Are you an asshole?

1:24:37.171 --> 1:24:38.806
Nah.

1:24:38.838 --> 1:24:40.274
I see you more as
a douche canoe.

1:24:47.581 --> 1:24:49.449
You know what?

1:24:49.483 --> 1:24:50.318
That's it.

1:25:03.697 --> 1:25:05.166
Fuck chop.

1:25:05.198 --> 1:25:07.268
I'm getting no-show
calls up the corn hole.

1:25:07.301 --> 1:25:10.171
You know, if... if... if what I'm
hearing turns out to be true.

1:25:10.203 --> 1:25:12.706
You can kiss that $25,000
job goodbye, mister.

1:25:12.739 --> 1:25:13.608
Yeah.

1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:14.541
Relax.

1:25:14.574 --> 1:25:15.475
I'm on the loop.

1:25:15.509 --> 1:25:16.409
Relax?

1:25:16.443 --> 1:25:18.412
You're my protege.

1:25:18.444 --> 1:25:20.881
I've been grooming you
to take over one day.

1:25:20.914 --> 1:25:24.719
Ignite your future, like I did.

1:25:24.752 --> 1:25:27.388
You know, it's not so bad.

1:25:27.421 --> 1:25:29.190
What's not that bad?

1:25:29.222 --> 1:25:30.557
This job.

1:25:30.591 --> 1:25:31.692
This town.

1:25:31.725 --> 1:25:33.561
There a lot worse
places to end up

1:25:33.594 --> 1:25:35.630
than running the campus
bus service at Kent

1:25:35.662 --> 1:25:38.398
Institute of Technology.

1:25:38.431 --> 1:25:40.233
But maybe you're right.

1:25:40.266 --> 1:25:42.302
Maybe I've wasted my life.

1:25:42.336 --> 1:25:44.605
I didn't say that.

1:25:44.637 --> 1:25:46.707
You didn't have to.

1:25:46.739 --> 1:25:48.842
I... I... I read subtext.

1:25:48.876 --> 1:25:51.779
Subtext?

1:25:51.811 --> 1:25:54.681
Truth is.

1:25:54.715 --> 1:25:58.185
I haven't been happy
in a long time.

1:25:58.219 --> 1:26:04.192
Sometimes, I just wish I could
go to sleep and never wake up.

1:26:04.225 --> 1:26:07.428
Fred, what was that noise?

1:26:07.461 --> 1:26:09.597
You mean
the cocked Ruger GP 100

1:26:09.630 --> 1:26:12.833
Revolver aimed at my temple?

1:26:12.865 --> 1:26:16.304
Fred, that's not funny.

1:26:16.337 --> 1:26:18.239
Fuck chop, thanks

1:26:18.271 --> 1:26:20.675
for giving me the courage
to do what I'm about to do.

1:26:23.444 --> 1:26:26.614
Tell my family, I...

1:26:26.646 --> 1:26:28.381
I don't know, just...

1:26:28.414 --> 1:26:29.817
Fred.

1:26:29.850 --> 1:26:31.953
Tell them I wasn't all bad.

1:26:31.985 --> 1:26:33.621
- Fred.
- Tell them.

1:26:34.587 --> 1:26:36.724
What the fuck?

1:26:36.756 --> 1:26:38.259
What the fuck did
you say to him?

1:26:38.292 --> 1:26:39.460
I don't know.

1:26:39.493 --> 1:26:40.528
I didn't, I didn't
tell him anything.

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:42.896
Fuck.

1:26:42.930 --> 1:26:45.300
Gotcha, ya buttholes.

1:26:48.636 --> 1:26:50.771
It was a sound effect
on my computer.

1:26:50.804 --> 1:26:51.672
Here.

1:26:51.704 --> 1:26:52.606
Listen.

1:26:55.743 --> 1:26:57.678
I'm embarrassed for you.

1:26:57.711 --> 1:26:58.713
Ugh.

1:26:58.746 --> 1:26:59.713
Falling for that.

1:26:59.747 --> 1:27:01.414
Game's got to respect game.

1:27:01.448 --> 1:27:02.350
Yeah.

1:27:02.382 --> 1:27:03.350
Fuck that guy.

1:27:03.384 --> 1:27:05.819
It was real fucking funny.

1:27:05.853 --> 1:27:06.787
Ah.

1:27:06.819 --> 1:27:08.222
Absolute buttholes.

1:27:10.823 --> 1:27:11.725
Yeah.

1:27:11.759 --> 1:27:12.560
Let's go.

1:27:26.372 --> 1:27:29.309
On my mark.

1:27:29.342 --> 1:27:30.677
Three.

1:27:30.711 --> 1:27:32.280
Two.

1:27:32.313 --> 1:27:32.913
One.

1:27:36.582 --> 1:27:37.484
Good shot.

1:27:40.554 --> 1:27:41.521
Ah.

1:27:41.555 --> 1:27:42.523
Yeah.

1:27:42.555 --> 1:27:45.659
Nice shot.

1:27:45.693 --> 1:27:47.328
The radio, the radio.

1:27:50.396 --> 1:27:51.332
Yeah.

1:27:51.364 --> 1:27:52.733
Fuck you.

1:27:52.765 --> 1:27:54.801
Get the ham.

1:27:54.835 --> 1:27:55.869
That's nasty.

1:27:55.903 --> 1:27:56.936
OK.

1:27:56.970 --> 1:27:57.805
Go.

1:28:10.884 --> 1:28:12.520
Yo, guys.
What the fuck?

1:28:12.552 --> 1:28:13.354
My house, man.

1:28:19.859 --> 1:28:20.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:28:20.927 --> 1:28:21.828
What?

1:28:21.862 --> 1:28:23.831
Oh my God.

1:28:23.863 --> 1:28:25.432
Huh?
What?

1:28:25.466 --> 1:28:26.400
Where you going?

1:28:26.432 --> 1:28:27.335
Get the fuck out of here.

1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:35.809
Hey, hey.

1:28:35.842 --> 1:28:36.976
Whoa, whoa.
What's happening?

1:28:37.010 --> 1:28:38.512
What's this?

1:28:38.545 --> 1:28:39.547
Oh, we're pretending
to kiss for our friends.

1:28:39.579 --> 1:28:40.613
I think they're rooting for us.

1:28:40.646 --> 1:28:42.917
Oh, hey, look.

1:28:42.949 --> 1:28:44.585
Aw.

1:28:44.618 --> 1:28:45.986
How much longer do you
think we have to do this for?

1:28:46.019 --> 1:28:47.822
Um, it's kind of
like 10 seconds.

1:28:47.854 --> 1:28:50.056
You sure?

1:28:50.090 --> 1:28:51.926
No, get the fuck away from me.

1:29:09.510 --> 1:29:12.012
I haven't done that much damage
since they popped their VP.

1:29:12.045 --> 1:29:13.480
Didn't he cry afterward?

1:29:13.514 --> 1:29:14.414
Yeah.

1:29:14.448 --> 1:29:15.416
He told me he loved me.

1:29:15.448 --> 1:29:16.817
See you guys.

1:29:16.850 --> 1:29:19.453
So if you ever figured
out whether or not you're

1:29:19.485 --> 1:29:22.590
an asshole, you should call me.

1:29:25.926 --> 1:29:29.096
Oh, wait.

1:29:29.128 --> 1:29:30.898
I thought you
should have this.

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:34.568
Thanks.

1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:36.069
Will you two fuck already?

1:29:36.103 --> 1:29:37.605
You shut up.

1:29:38.604 --> 1:29:39.406
Oh, shoot.

1:29:44.144 --> 1:29:46.680
That Amy?

1:29:46.712 --> 1:29:47.581
Yeah.

1:29:50.650 --> 1:29:51.885
Well, that's awkward.

1:29:55.988 --> 1:29:57.791
Keep in mind, kid.

1:29:57.824 --> 1:30:01.095
That girl wants to fuck one
thing and one thing only.

1:30:01.127 --> 1:30:03.496
It's your head.

1:30:03.529 --> 1:30:05.765
Hey, Pineapple.

1:30:05.798 --> 1:30:07.868
Was that true what
you told me at juvie?

1:30:07.900 --> 1:30:11.572
Uh, cracking out because
of the repetition?

1:30:11.604 --> 1:30:12.472
Yeah, man.

1:30:12.506 --> 1:30:13.841
It was.

1:30:13.873 --> 1:30:18.746
How'd you learn to,
like, live in a time loop?

1:30:18.779 --> 1:30:21.115
I didn't.

1:30:21.148 --> 1:30:23.617
I broke out.

1:30:23.649 --> 1:30:26.786
Really?

1:30:26.819 --> 1:30:31.090
So you're like a fugitive?

1:30:31.123 --> 1:30:33.059
Everyone's a fugitive
for something, kid.

1:30:37.029 --> 1:30:39.632
See you tomorrow.

1:30:39.666 --> 1:30:41.869
Don't do anything stupid.

1:30:41.902 --> 1:30:43.604
Or you know what?

1:30:43.636 --> 1:30:44.637
Do something stupid.

1:30:44.671 --> 1:30:45.506
I don't give a fuck.

1:30:48.140 --> 1:30:49.143
I left something
up there for you.

1:30:55.748 --> 1:30:56.850
Is it stolen?

1:32:31.677 --> 1:32:34.280
Fucking bus bitch.

1:32:34.314 --> 1:32:36.650
Hey, what's your 20?

1:32:36.682 --> 1:32:40.253
Why aren't you
stopping for pick pus?

1:32:40.287 --> 1:32:42.189
Fuck chop!

1:32:42.221 --> 1:32:43.690
Michael!

1:32:43.724 --> 1:32:44.859
What the shit!

1:33:09.048 --> 1:33:11.719
Fuck chop, can you hear me?

1:33:11.752 --> 1:33:15.122
Don't think I won't
fire you, Michael.

1:33:15.154 --> 1:33:16.689
Fuck chop!

1:33:16.722 --> 1:33:17.690
The safety...

1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:37.003
Josh, what's your 20?

1:34:37.037 --> 1:34:37.905
Come on.

1:34:37.938 --> 1:34:38.939
Where you at, Josh?

1:34:38.971 --> 1:34:40.206
Are you taking a wiz there, bud.

1:34:44.144 --> 1:34:45.244
Shit!

1:34:45.278 --> 1:34:48.382
Josh where you at?

1:34:48.414 --> 1:34:51.885
Josh!

1:39:55.121 --> 1:39:56.222
Hello.

1:39:56.256 --> 1:39:57.124
Hey, honey.

1:39:57.157 --> 1:39:58.358
Oh hiya, love bug.

1:39:58.390 --> 1:39:59.358
How's work?

1:39:59.391 --> 1:40:01.761
I'm killing it, as per use.

1:40:01.795 --> 1:40:03.230
How was the baby doctor?

1:40:03.262 --> 1:40:04.797
Are
you sitting down?

1:40:04.831 --> 1:40:07.134
Of course, I'm sitting.

1:40:07.167 --> 1:40:08.602
What else would I be, uh...

1:40:08.635 --> 1:40:09.735
Have you eaten yet?

1:40:09.769 --> 1:40:11.070
Yeah.

1:40:11.104 --> 1:40:12.672
I, uh, did just
eat dinner, but I

1:40:12.704 --> 1:40:14.274
don't see how that's relevant.

1:40:14.306 --> 1:40:18.612
So
we're having twins.

1:40:18.645 --> 1:40:19.480
Twins?

1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:22.681
Fred?

1:40:22.715 --> 1:40:23.784
Yeah, yeah.

1:40:23.817 --> 1:40:25.217
Just give me one second, please.

1:40:25.251 --> 1:40:26.386
OK?

1:40:26.418 --> 1:40:28.220
Fuck!

1:40:28.253 --> 1:40:29.122
Fuck!

1:40:29.154 --> 1:40:30.556
Fuck!
