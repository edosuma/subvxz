to remove the kid?

00:18.719 --> 00:21.455
- My sister, Zoe, she suffers
from mental health issues.

of the end of you.

He would be almost 130
if he were still alive.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.303

question, Timmy.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.318
What do you mean,
why do we eat pigs?

00:50.351 --> 00:53.421
That's like asking,
why do we eat chicken

00:53.454 --> 00:56.357
or any of these
other kinds of meat?

00:57.491 --> 01:00.528
We eat meat because
of the food chain.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.764
Do you know what
the food chain is, Timmy?

01:03.797 --> 01:08.669
Well, the first thing
to know about the food chain

01:08.702 --> 01:10.338
is that we're on top of it,

01:10.371 --> 01:13.341
and everything else
is lower down.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.277
You know how Rascal
catches rats

01:16.310 --> 01:19.347
in the alley
behind the house?

01:19.380 --> 01:20.781
Well, that's because

01:20.814 --> 01:23.884
he's higher up on
the food chain than they are.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.419
[laughs]

01:25.453 --> 01:27.688
It's just how things work.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.890
Animals that get eaten

01:29.923 --> 01:32.260
are supposed to get eaten,

01:32.293 --> 01:35.763
and sometimes there were
just too many of them anyway.

01:35.796 --> 01:43.204

about a thing, Timmy.

gotten that chinchilla.

like Joseph Peach.

the Peach family disappear?

two years after I was born.

A group of workers came here
to the house looking for Peach.

07:23.644 --> 07:27.615
They broke the door down,
and the house was empty.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.583

go after him anyway?

you know, like,

07:36.023 --> 07:38.025

his daughters were killed,

old enough to read

about your dad?

of police right now?

Oh, my dad,
and you know what?

13:24.571 --> 13:25.839
He cleaned up the force.
- Oh, yeah?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.107
That is a matter of opinion.

of opinion, huh?

13:30.477 --> 13:32.612
But could we just please

13:32.645 --> 13:35.382
figure out who this guy is?

was this, uh,

You're experiencing
anosognosia,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.277
and we've dealt
with this before.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.513

Mm-mm, it's different.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.547
- No, it's not.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.616
This is a symptom
of your illness.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.419
You are not recognizing

19:12.452 --> 19:15.955
that you have an illness.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.226
Ugh, God, I hate this.

I will never,
ever get used to this.

I mean, where did you
even get that shirt?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.701
Okay, you--you left the house,

19:28.735 --> 19:31.338

[soft eerie music]

19:34.374 --> 19:36.376

- Wait a minute.
Did he tell you his name?

Joseph? Joe?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.889

calm down for me?

all around him.

this humming or buzzing.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.620
And I realized it was flies--

20:20.653 --> 20:23.856
thousands and thousands
of flies.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.760
And they came together all
in one voice and it said...

there's something bad
happening in this city,

wanna leave anymore.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.010

he killed and ate a guy

26:48.107 --> 26:49.742
but you--

26:49.776 --> 26:52.078
you were always
sensitive, Luke.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.415
I want you to go home,

30:33.032 --> 30:35.167
You think that
all these stories--

30:35.201 --> 30:37.136
the urban legends,
the staircases--

30:37.169 --> 30:40.973
that they're all connected
to the disappearances?

30:41.007 --> 30:42.408
What about the police,

30:42.441 --> 30:43.943
what about the people
in Butcher's Block--

30:43.976 --> 30:45.244
what do they think?

30:45.277 --> 30:47.613
- There's a story
the kids tell--

30:47.646 --> 30:51.450
kind of a bogeyman, you know,
in the bad parts of the city.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.220
They call him The Butcher.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.022
You've probably
seen the murals--

30:56.055 --> 31:00.092

31:00.126 --> 31:03.229
They say it's Joseph Peach--

31:03.262 --> 31:07.199
went mad with grief and rage
after his daughters were killed.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.969
Now, when people disappear,

31:10.002 --> 31:12.238
they say The Butcher took them.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.243
- Zoe didn't disappear,
though.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.445
Something happened to her.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.614

Come.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.388
We're waiting for you.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.124
Some people
would say it's impolite

33:45.157 --> 33:46.492
to bring
an uninvited guest,

33:46.525 --> 33:48.760
but I say I don't care
about what people say.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.063
Come, come, sit down.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.598
Welcome.

she requested.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.412
- What procedure?

34:40.446 --> 34:43.715
- I'd be happy to show you.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.351
- Who are all of you,

34:45.384 --> 34:47.286
and why are you pretending
to be the Peaches?

34:47.319 --> 34:49.888
- They're not pretending.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.592
Robert, the eldest son.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.494
Edie, his wife.

Each year, there is a moment
when it's suddenly summer.

35:23.822 --> 35:27.393
The grass is a deeper green,

35:27.426 --> 35:29.561
and the air is pregnant.

35:29.595 --> 35:32.198

35:32.231 --> 35:35.234
Isn't it cruel to--

35:35.267 --> 35:37.636
to know that
a day like this

35:37.669 --> 35:41.173
could be our last?

35:41.207 --> 35:44.276
My daughters went for a walk

35:44.310 --> 35:46.312
to feed the swans,

35:46.345 --> 35:47.913
and they never returned.

from Butcher's Block,

35:50.316 --> 35:52.384
who we punish accordingly.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.968
the higher power of some kind--

bless this family,

36:12.704 --> 36:17.276
and bless the bones
of our enemies.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.711
- Our sisters,

36:19.745 --> 36:22.414
who are not gone...

36:22.448 --> 36:25.451

36:25.484 --> 36:30.222

All right?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.016
See?

39:11.049 --> 39:16.422
*

39:16.455 --> 39:18.557
Can you see it?

39:20.492 --> 39:24.763
Now, with a little probing,

39:24.796 --> 39:27.032
I can...

39:27.065 --> 39:30.902
get to your deepest trauma.

- Mom?

39:56.462 --> 39:58.530
*

39:58.564 --> 40:01.166
- It's your mother, isn't it?

40:01.199 --> 40:03.101
And your sister.

40:03.134 --> 40:09.207
*

- Mom?

40:11.176 --> 40:16.882

If he wakes up,

41:04.129 --> 41:07.733
you'll be just like
your mother and sister.

Actually,
it's not a matter of if,
