<i>Previously on "Brothers & Sisters"</i>

00:03.300 --> 00:06.701
- Holly, I saw you at my dad's 
office the day before he died...
- Yes.

00:06.751 --> 00:08.016
I saw you again at the funeral.

00:08.067 --> 00:10.212
- Who else knows about you and my father?
- Saul.

00:10.504 --> 00:13.176
Your Dad sold a million dollars of his 
own stock in the company.

00:13.226 --> 00:16.481
He made the pension fund pay him 
fifteen million dollars for it.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.392
He inflated the value of the stock.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.900
We're talking serious embezzlement

00:19.900 --> 00:21.509
and Dad was responsible.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.412
Sarah, you're president now. What do you wanna do?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.858
I usually steer clear of your kind.

00:26.935 --> 00:29.062
I like a man who's not afraid of a little highliner.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.506
Well, you know, a lot.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.052
- Kitty, Warren Salter.
- Nice to meet you.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.029
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.293
See how great you two are together already?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.181
Jonathan!

00:40.400 --> 00:43.232
Stay in New York. Start a family with me!

00:47.874 --> 00:48.453
Warren!

00:49.155 --> 00:51.870
God! Stop touching your frigging hair!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.392
It's not right. I think I'm gonna cut it.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.945
Why are you so obsessed with your hair?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.936
My research. The more I speak out against the war,

00:59.400 --> 01:02.936
- the more America needs me to look like a soldier.
- Oh, just like a Democrat.

01:02.986 --> 01:04.992
- Live by the polls, die by the polls.
- Yeah,

01:05.042 --> 01:07.832
- like you haven't changed your look since the numbers came in!
- What have I changed?

01:07.832 --> 01:10.900
- Your lipstick.
- That's it! That's what's different about you.

01:11.200 --> 01:11.900
I was trying to figure it out.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.408
It's the lipstick! A shade lighter.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.563
I knew it.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.079
OK, folks, see you out there on the air.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.818
So, what do you say we go out to dinner? Hmm?

01:21.968 --> 01:24.904
Belle Soleil? Last week, they sat me between Larry King and Fergie.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.564
Warren, I'm not having dinner with you or Fergie anywhere, ever.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.267
Hmm. Well, I'll take that as a "no."

01:33.317 --> 01:34.066
For now.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.314
Why don't you two just "hump" and get it over with?

01:39.364 --> 01:39.900
"Hump?"

01:40.300 --> 01:43.884
Lyla, the last time somebody "humped" in America,

01:43.884 --> 01:47.798
it was 1983 in a Porky's movie.

01:50.023 --> 01:51.699
Oh, God!

01:52.800 --> 01:54.404
Is this Jack's drink?

01:54.454 --> 01:55.517
Uh huh. Straight vodka.

01:55.567 --> 01:56.637
Are you telling me

01:57.211 --> 02:00.424
that Jack, the host of our show, is blotto?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.100
Believe me, Honey. You wouldn't want him any other way.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.191
Exit, stage right.

02:05.241 --> 02:09.380
Talk of Japan's impending partial pull-out of coalition forces from Iraq

02:09.430 --> 02:10.535
has Americans asking,

02:10.585 --> 02:12.478
"When are our brave men and women coming home?"

02:12.528 --> 02:14.049
Kitty, give us a timeline.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.537
The reason that she's hesitating, Jack, is that there is no timeline.

02:19.537 --> 02:23.580
No, this administration believes in pulling out about as much as a high school sophomore.

02:23.630 --> 02:24.800
Oh! Warren, please.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.523
They promise they will, but when the time comes,

02:29.100 --> 02:31.968
Oh my God! He is saying everything to her I want to say,

02:32.018 --> 02:34.035
and in front of four hundred million people!

02:34.085 --> 02:35.698
Mom, it's not the World Cup.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.529
You're enjoying this too much, Nora. It's unseemly.

02:38.529 --> 02:40.219
Why can't you ever meet anyone like that?

02:40.496 --> 02:43.267
Like Warren Salter? First of all, he's straight.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.479
Like that ever stopped you before.

02:45.529 --> 02:47.300
Where do I sign on this one? I don't see --

02:47.500 --> 02:49.300
Here. Right here, where it's flagged.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.067
- Sarah's already signed off as president.
- Why are we selling all of this?

02:53.117 --> 02:55.766
We're consolidating leftover properties.

02:55.816 --> 02:58.174
The company can use as much money as we can raise right now.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.243
So we sell...

02:59.400 --> 03:02.323
It would take 37 hours to walk you through it.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.010
What about this one? Luckenville Lane?

03:06.400 --> 03:09.366
That's in Silver Lake, isn't it? Right off of Sunset?

03:09.366 --> 03:10.760
Yeah, right. It's a house.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.265
I own a house?

03:13.500 --> 03:14.600
What does a house have to do with fruit?

03:15.300 --> 03:16.500
It's part of an acquisition.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.837
We bought out a distributor twenty years ago.

03:18.887 --> 03:21.596
One of their assets was this tiny little house,

03:21.646 --> 03:24.621
and it doesn't produce much income, so it's time to sell, that's all.

03:25.650 --> 03:27.154
Well, I love that neighborhood.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.545
Now, it has all those wonderful Spanish homes,

03:30.595 --> 03:32.300
and who knows,

03:32.400 --> 03:33.700
maybe I won't want to be stuck in this great big old house forever.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.846
Nora, it's a nothing place with a tenant and some bushes.

03:36.846 --> 03:40.723
- It wouldn't suit you, sweetheart.
- I'll be the the judge of that. Let's go look at it.

03:40.773 --> 03:41.961
Let's go tomorrow, OK?

03:42.800 --> 03:44.984
Oh, he is so handsome!

03:47.500 --> 03:50.236
Honey, can I cancel the Pasadena Rec Center?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.300
Why?

03:51.500 --> 03:53.991
Paige isn't swimming anymore. It's $150 a month.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.300
Sarah, I'm the one with the kids all day.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.874
It's a place for us to go.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.090
I mean, I work out and Coop gets daycare.

04:02.140 --> 04:02.689
Oh.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.677
Well, Paige not swimming, that's temporary.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.163
How do you know it's temporary?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.571
Ah...

04:12.300 --> 04:14.544
the pool... your dad.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.774
She saw him. She was there when he died.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.728
Oh....

04:28.100 --> 04:30.200
So, Kitty's got the hots for a Liberal, huh?

04:35.382 --> 04:36.891
Well, it's a dark hour. Agreed.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.885
But, it's also a time when we know who our friends are. Now,

04:39.935 --> 04:41.992
where is Canada in all of this?

04:42.042 --> 04:43.393
You're mad at Canada now?

04:43.443 --> 04:45.806
Well, they sent troops to both world wars, to Vietnam...

04:45.856 --> 04:47.827
I don't think Canada sent any troops to Vietnam.

04:47.877 --> 04:50.482
- Well, I'm pretty certain that they did.
- Pretty certain?

04:50.532 --> 04:53.753
Extremely certain. In fact, I am filled with certitude

04:53.753 --> 04:55.301
that Canada sent troops to Vietnam.

04:55.351 --> 04:57.314
Well, would you be prepared to wager, say,

04:57.700 --> 04:58.763
I don't know, dinner?

04:59.266 --> 05:00.400
Oh, oh. OK, OK, folks.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.574
- Things are getting a little steamy in the studio.
- You're on.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.163
OK, Jack. Do you have the answer?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.100
(clears throat)

05:08.100 --> 05:10.288
Kitty, um, while there may have been

05:10.300 --> 05:12.982
a few Canadian nationals that fought with Uncle Sam,

05:13.082 --> 05:17.421
on the lives of both my parents who are alive and well in the good city of Montreal...

05:17.571 --> 05:20.711
Canada did not send any troops to Vietnam.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.800
(sighs)

05:26.500 --> 05:29.793
Canada did not send any troops to Vietnam.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.188
- Tell me you didn't see it.
- See what?

05:37.200 --> 05:41.049
Nothing. Honey, it's like four o'clock in the morning in New York.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.807
Ah, I can't sleep. So, a date, huh?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.663
Ah, you did see it.

05:46.663 --> 05:49.967
- Jonathan, it's...
- You made a date with a guy on national television.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.581
It's not national, we're not in all markets yet,

05:52.631 --> 05:54.908
and it's not a date. It's anything but a date.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.811
I would rather have dinner with Pol Pot

05:56.861 --> 05:58.387
and have my head chopped off at the end than

05:58.984 --> 06:02.612
break bread with that... him...

06:02.662 --> 06:05.045
My friends saw, Kitty. I got calls, emails...

06:05.050 --> 06:06.100
It was just a bet.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.700
In the five years we've known each other,

06:07.900 --> 06:09.454
you've never gotten a single factoid wrong,

06:09.504 --> 06:13.156
ncluding somehow being aware that the bluehen chicken is the state bird of...

06:13.206 --> 06:14.850
Of Delaware, I know.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.494
So, what's going on?

06:19.500 --> 06:21.140
I just got it wrong.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.659
I screwed up, and

06:23.800 --> 06:25.254
I lost a bet.

06:26.100 --> 06:26.916
Sorry.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.874
Get some sleep.

06:34.300 --> 06:39.126
I expected it to be kinda dilipidated and run-down, you know, being a long-term rental,

06:39.176 --> 06:40.987
but you have kept it up beautifully. It's

06:41.037 --> 06:43.406
absolutely charming. May I take a peek in the kitchen?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.299
My house is your house.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.700
Is everything OK?

06:48.900 --> 06:51.366
- It's fine. I'm fine. There's nothing of William's here.
- OK. OK.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.656
It's just wonderful! Look at this view! Oh,

06:56.756 --> 07:00.431
you have made just a lovely home for yourself, --

07:01.100 --> 07:01.900
- Holly.
- Holly.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.641
Decorating is one of my passions.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.026
Obviously. How long have you lived here?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.711
Fifteen years, roughly.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.400
Fifteen years.

07:11.900 --> 07:16.486
Well, you have taken such care with everything, almost as if it were your own.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.871
Oh, I love this movie.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.993
My husband and I just saw it again just a few months ago at the

07:27.093 --> 07:30.931
Classic Cinema series at the library. I love old movies.

07:30.981 --> 07:32.667
Actually, I'm in it.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.722
- You're an actress?
- Yeah.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.378
What part did you play?

07:37.428 --> 07:38.834
It was just a small part, you'd --

07:38.934 --> 07:42.175
I played the senator's wife in the banquet scene.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.511
How exciting for you!

07:45.700 --> 07:47.864
Saulie, we have a star in our midst!

07:47.900 --> 07:49.428
How can we sell the house?

07:49.900 --> 07:51.913
I didn't realize.

07:51.963 --> 07:53.008
It's not definite.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.861
We have to take an inventory of William's assets, so we...

07:55.911 --> 07:59.625
William was my husband and he recently passed away,

07:59.675 --> 08:02.590
so there are unknown assets.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.575
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you so much for the tour.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.573
- It was really lovely meeting you.
- Likewise.

08:07.623 --> 08:09.907
We'll go now, so you can get on with your life.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.131
But, I may call and bother you,

08:12.700 --> 08:15.037
- for decorating tips.
- I'd love that.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.084
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

08:18.900 --> 08:19.546
Bye.

08:19.819 --> 08:20.471
Bye.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.605
For the billionth time, Mother, it is not a date.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.866
Listen, I don't care who dates him.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.405
It could be you, it could be Kevin, but

08:38.456 --> 08:41.019
someone in this family should be dating that man.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.082
What is this, "Fiddler on The Roof?"

08:43.200 --> 08:44.538
All right, I just mowed the lawn

08:44.600 --> 08:47.400
and I was stung by a bee, but calm down, I'm fine.

08:47.400 --> 08:47.800
Good.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.852
Ah, Dude, where's the OJ? Nice!

08:51.500 --> 08:53.791
Oh, Dude. You stink. Take a shower.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.300
Jump in the pool.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.505
No one has been in that pool in the longest time.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.025
Mom, nobody's going to go in that pool.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.080
I talked to Sarah,

09:01.080 --> 09:02.917
Paige isn't going to go into any pool.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.843
OH!

09:13.400 --> 09:15.554
Why didn't anybody tell me about Paige?

09:15.604 --> 09:18.856
What we don't tell you, Mom, could fill the Library of Congress.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.656
Well, it's very simple. We'll give a party,

09:20.706 --> 09:22.234
a great big party.

09:22.284 --> 09:24.312
When she sees everyone else in the water,

09:24.362 --> 09:25.585
then she'll be just fine.

09:25.635 --> 09:27.459
It's like the time you were afraid to get in the shower.

09:27.459 --> 09:28.511
Mom, no more, "like when I"s.

09:28.561 --> 09:31.502
You make up these memories all day long. It drives me crazy.

09:31.552 --> 09:34.647
We'll have hot dogs and drinks and new pool toys and tiki torches...

09:34.747 --> 09:37.730
Yeah, cause tiki torches are gonna get Paige to swim in the pool her grandpa died in.

09:37.730 --> 09:39.403
Will you let me handle it?

09:39.453 --> 09:44.466
And, my darling, would you please drop these off at your uncle's office on your way home?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.971
That's a lot of papework.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.902
It's not me. It's the company's. Saul is consolidating.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.629
And tell your uncle I might wanna keep that little house.

09:53.629 --> 09:56.031
I love Silver Lake, and who knows?

09:57.100 --> 09:57.850
Silver Lake?

09:57.900 --> 10:00.659
Yes, there's a struggling actress living there. I met her.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.313
It'd be cruel to just throw her out.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.058
I mean, from the looks of things, she hasn't worked since the early 80s.

10:06.616 --> 10:07.650
Ah, you met her? When?

10:08.800 --> 10:12.342
Yesterday, Saul took me. I thought about giving the little house to you, Kitty,

10:12.392 --> 10:16.055
but then there's so many interesting people in the neighborhood, I thought you wouldn't feel at home.

10:16.100 --> 10:16.869
Hey!

10:18.200 --> 10:18.976
Good one.

10:21.182 --> 10:21.941
Justin!

10:21.991 --> 10:22.748
Look, I gotta get going.

10:22.798 --> 10:25.847
- Justin! What's going on?
- Ah, look, I gotta shower and

10:25.847 --> 10:28.053
I gotta get this stuff to Uncle Saul's, so just please leave me alone.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.476
- Justin! Hey, come on! What's the matter? You're shaking!
- So?

10:31.526 --> 10:33.827
- Are you on -- ?
- No. I'm taking a break from that stuff.

10:33.877 --> 10:35.927
Justin, come on! Just tell me what's going on!

10:36.459 --> 10:38.207
You really wanna know what's going on?

10:39.700 --> 10:41.809
- You know that house Mom doesn't want to sell?
- Yeah?

10:41.900 --> 10:44.727
- The woman that lives there --
- You're having a thing with her?

10:44.727 --> 10:48.705
No! Dad did. He had an affair with her.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.739
- You are on something.
- Look, I'm not on something.

10:50.789 --> 10:52.811
I talked to her. Uncle Saul knows.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.011
It went on forever, I mean...

10:54.061 --> 10:55.586
Kitty, she came to Dad's funeral.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.068
And Mom owns her house?

11:02.369 --> 11:04.203
Ah, it, it's so twisted you don't even wanna know,

11:04.253 --> 11:07.109
so just let me go before I go someplace else, OK?

11:07.159 --> 11:08.133
OK, go.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.230
Hey, Justin. Don't -- Don't tell anybody else.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.405
Look, I didn't even wanna tell you.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.121
So, you gonna take this office once I get Dad's papers and stuff?

11:22.171 --> 11:24.331
No, I'm fine down the hall.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.086
Oh, so, Tommy's gonna take it?

11:26.136 --> 11:27.623
I don't know. You'll have to ask Tommy.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.686
God, you two, you're lick rock 'em sock 'em robots.

11:30.736 --> 11:32.227
You should just be thankful you don't have

11:32.277 --> 11:34.815
- to work with someone whose diapers you used to --
- Eat.

11:34.865 --> 11:36.454
- I only did that once.
- Twice!

11:36.504 --> 11:38.320
You fired the Roweka Brothers?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.977
- Ah, wh--? What?
- Good morning.

11:41.027 --> 11:42.724
You fired Roger and Kenny Roweka?

11:42.774 --> 11:45.771
- Yeah. I let Jose fire them, yes.
- Why? Why would you?

11:45.821 --> 11:47.664
Because they sit around the motor pool all day,

11:47.714 --> 11:49.309
playing concentration, getting in the way.

11:49.359 --> 11:52.031
Sarah, the Rowekas are the cousins of the Petersons, OK?

11:52.081 --> 11:55.311
The people on Riverside who print all our packaging and marketing material.

11:55.361 --> 11:57.661
We keep them on as a favor to Dick Peterson.

11:57.711 --> 11:59.264
Everybody knows they don't do anything.

11:59.314 --> 12:00.792
Maybe I could get this office,

12:00.842 --> 12:02.425
then I could just watch you two everyday!

12:02.425 --> 12:05.567
- So, why did Jose ask me?
- Because he knew you'd say yes.

12:05.617 --> 12:08.585
Look, Dad and I have been telling Jose for years not to fire them.

12:08.585 --> 12:10.313
It was an unspoken deal.

12:10.413 --> 12:15.068
OK, I'm sorry about the Roweka Brothers.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.409
Call them, tell them you made a mistake.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.689
No, we cannot afford to pay people to do nothing,

12:18.689 --> 12:22.088
- not now, not ever! Kevin, tell him.
- Sorry, it's between you two.

12:22.088 --> 12:23.640
You're gonna get a call, Sarah, trust me.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.942
You're gonna get a call. We're gonna lose the Petersons

12:25.992 --> 12:29.083
and they save us a helluva lot more money than the Rowekas cost.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.504
Thanks for backing me up there, Girlfriend.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.818
Sorry, I wasn't feeling it.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.667
- You weren't feeling it?
- No, I wasn't.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.683
Oh, oh, you will feel it.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.831
Justin, sweetheart!

12:43.881 --> 12:46.175
- You took Mom over to that woman's house?
- Justin, calm down, will you?

12:46.175 --> 12:48.352
You honestly believe that I took her there willingly?

12:48.402 --> 12:50.828
She insisted. What kind of person do you think I am?

12:50.878 --> 12:52.840
- I don't know. What kind are you?
- She's my sister.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.817
I am dying inside, a wreck.

12:55.867 --> 12:57.045
You know what? Serves you right.

12:57.674 --> 13:01.324
- She didn't sign this.
- Exactly! Because she totally digs Holly now.

13:01.374 --> 13:02.538
I mean, how are you gonna fix this?

13:02.588 --> 13:04.514
- I don't know what I'm doing and Kitty's freaking out!
- Kitty?

13:05.147 --> 13:06.612
What do you mean, Kitty? You told Kitty?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.479
Yeah, you know what? I thought it was time to share the joy.

13:09.306 --> 13:11.312
Justin, Justin.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.027
I wish you hadn't done that.

13:13.419 --> 13:14.650
Don't worry, she's not going to tell anyone.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.663
It'd be like tearing down Mt. Rushmore for her.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.221
This is a nightmare.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.367
You oughta be careful of the gin martini, you know.

13:22.417 --> 13:26.012
Well, I need something to tolerate this place. It's filled with hookers.

13:26.062 --> 13:27.513
They're not hookers. They're third wives.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.130
- And why are you so miserable?
- Look at this.

13:31.180 --> 13:37.623
Twenty year-old girls out with men three times their age, being furiously exploited for a veal chop and a little red wine.

13:38.196 --> 13:40.195
- Are you one of those women who hate men?
- No.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.372
- Sex?
- No.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.301
But, I hate how men are driven by sex.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.017
Well, get used to it,

13:46.067 --> 13:49.410
because the sex drive in men is a fiery deity.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.252
It is ancient and it ain't going away.

13:51.302 --> 13:52.887
I don't know who did what to you,

13:52.987 --> 13:57.138
but until you accept that sex is behind everything we do, say and think,

13:57.188 --> 13:59.476
you're going to be very, very bitter.

13:59.526 --> 14:02.875
You know what, Warren? I'm already there and your little Satanic sermon, it isn't helping!

14:08.000 --> 14:08.913
Sorry.

14:09.600 --> 14:15.100
Its just that I've found out today that my recently deceased father was a cheater.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.894
And its thrown me for a...

14:20.000 --> 14:21.461
its thrown me.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.763
Want to talk about it?

14:23.800 --> 14:29.044
With you? And hear more about your little "fiery deity"?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.835
You don't have to. I was just offering.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.726
I had a boyfriend who cheated on me once, in college.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.300
His name was Alex Sapien.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.739
And when Tonya Cavanaugh told me what he'd done,

14:49.500 --> 14:51.900
I went, I found him

14:52.300 --> 14:54.104
and I told him what I thought.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.397
I said "the world is too fragile for people to be untrue.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.859
There's too much at stake, and life's too short for lies.

15:07.642 --> 15:10.308
And you're the worst kind of person in the world,

15:10.358 --> 15:11.856
because you wasted my heart,

15:14.431 --> 15:15.335
my time...".

15:16.500 --> 15:17.671
And what did he say?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.345
It doesn't matter what he said.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.250
What matters is that I'm sitting here thinking the same thing about my dad.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.718
And I know its so... silly,

15:31.700 --> 15:34.723
because I'm a grown woman and I know that that's what men do,

15:34.773 --> 15:37.557
but he was my dad...and he's dead...

15:39.889 --> 15:41.426
and I can't kill him.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.528
And I can't ask him why.

15:47.900 --> 15:48.948
Kitty?

15:48.998 --> 15:53.784
Oh, what? Am I sexy when I cry? What stupid thing are you gonna say?

15:55.100 --> 15:59.030
I was just gonna say that we don't love the people we love because they're perfect.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.629
We love the people we love because they are.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.340
Even after they're gone.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.182
Finish up your drink and I'll take you home.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.821
God, you are so hot!

16:28.991 --> 16:30.654
Warren, just please, just...

16:30.700 --> 16:31.528
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.227
I either have to quit my job or I have to die.

16:37.227 --> 16:37.848
Relax.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.611
No, Sarah, I can't. You have no idea.

16:39.661 --> 16:42.176
This guy is a man-whore and he is so self-satisifed,

16:42.226 --> 16:43.981
I know that he's already gone to "The Nation"

16:44.031 --> 16:45.555
and told everybody there that he nailed me.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.804
Oh my God! My life as I know it is over.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.079
Yes, I'm still on hold.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.640
I thought that you hated the guy. So, why'd you sleep with him?

16:53.690 --> 16:56.628
I didn't, it was the gin. The gin, the gin slept with him.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.796
We had the gin talk five years ago. It's the...

16:59.846 --> 17:01.289
"devil's drink"

17:01.289 --> 17:02.845
No more gin for you, not ever.

17:02.895 --> 17:05.804
God, oh God, oh God, I could die, I could

17:05.854 --> 17:06.951
die.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.851
Hello? Yes? I've been on hold

17:08.901 --> 17:11.366
for Mr. Peterson for 25 minutes, could you --??

17:12.708 --> 17:13.346
Hi Kit.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.909
I've got Dick Peterson on hold.

17:15.959 --> 17:19.477
- Dick Peterson has me on hold.
- Um, yeah, I know.

17:19.527 --> 17:20.390
So, what's going on?

17:20.440 --> 17:23.040
- He's suing us.
- He's suing us? What for?

17:23.089 --> 17:25.454
He says he and Dad had a binding verbal agreement

17:25.503 --> 17:26.810
about the Roweka Brothers.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.801
Way to go, Sarah.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.277
You got laid last night.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.994
How did you know that?

17:37.400 --> 17:38.665
Cause it's a work day, and you're here,

17:38.715 --> 17:40.533
and it's the only time you two talk like this.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.395
Good for you.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.107
I want to kill him.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.688
Boy, you guys are really making it work, huh?

17:49.800 --> 17:50.833
You gonna tell Jonathan?

17:51.127 --> 17:54.334
Oh my God! Oh my God, Jonathan!

17:54.400 --> 17:55.433
I don't get it. Kitty,

17:55.433 --> 17:57.159
my little Republican sister,

17:57.209 --> 17:59.955
she doesn't have one-night stands, gin or no gin,

18:00.005 --> 18:01.363
unless she has a very good reason.

18:02.384 --> 18:04.078
He caught me in a weak moment.

18:04.178 --> 18:04.997
Hmm?

18:05.300 --> 18:06.009
Sarah,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.126
there's a house in Silver Lake.

18:09.176 --> 18:12.742
- What? You always wanted to do it in a house in Silver Lake?
- Sarah

18:14.700 --> 18:15.800
Dad, um...

18:16.000 --> 18:17.009
What about Dad?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.475
Of course he had an affair.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.221
His whole generation saw that as quid pro quo.

18:22.271 --> 18:25.647
What, I pay the bills, I get a little something on the side, everyone's happy.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.749
You really saying you're surprised?

18:27.799 --> 18:29.080
No, I'm not surprised. I'm...

18:30.251 --> 18:31.808
interested, I guess.

18:31.858 --> 18:34.820
To tell you the truth, I'm a lot more shocked at Kitty's behavior.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.040
Don't you dare tell her I told you!

18:36.090 --> 18:40.313
- What, Sarah, you can trust me!
- Yeah, 'til I can't.

18:40.313 --> 18:40.363
(intercom beeping)

18:41.500 --> 18:43.950
- What's up?
- Scotty Wandell is here.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.783
OK, give me 30 seconds and send him in.

18:46.833 --> 18:47.790
Time to think.

18:48.400 --> 18:53.086
Oh, yeah? There's no such thing as a binding verbal agreement, is there?

18:53.849 --> 18:57.286
Ah, if the arrangement Dad had with these people was ongoing for more than a year,

18:57.336 --> 19:00.651
even if it was just a verbal agreement, then yeah, it could be forced in a lawsuit,

19:00.751 --> 19:02.670
which could get expensive.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.033
What should I do?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.198
I don't know. Rehire them, make it right.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.858
What's the point of having a lawyer if they can't help you?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.465
- Tell me about it. Hey, you're --

19:13.465 --> 19:16.230
- "Great Shoes," or Sarah, Kevin's sister.
- Yeah.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.461
Scotty. Nice to meet you. For a second I thought maybe you were his peer.

19:19.511 --> 19:20.994
Only to senior prom.

19:21.044 --> 19:23.030
Your older brother's a peach.

19:23.030 --> 19:23.585
Younger.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.746
- Thanks for the compliment.
- It's not a compliment to you, it's an insult to me.

19:27.796 --> 19:29.433
Hardly! I like older guys.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.278
- So, Scotty. Are you a client?
- I'm a witness.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.753
Well, I think I'm far more than a witness, but

19:33.803 --> 19:37.438
- all he ever wants to talk about is the case.
- Ah, we're on the clock here, so, ah --

19:37.488 --> 19:38.537
- OK.
- Yeah.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.072
Scotty, how would you like to come to a party tonight's at my mother's?

19:42.122 --> 19:45.126
- No! Sarah!
- It's a pool party. My whole family will be there.

19:45.176 --> 19:47.168
I'd love to! Should I bring a suit?

19:47.250 --> 19:48.349
What's your email address?

19:48.399 --> 19:51.285
Ah, mollyjustmight@hotmail.com

19:51.285 --> 19:53.969
Great! Well, we'll see you tonight

19:54.000 --> 19:56.478
Take a seat.
Bitch!

19:56.528 --> 19:58.029
No, but payback is.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.049
Oh, Nora.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.974
Oh, Nora, what have you done?

20:09.024 --> 20:09.507
Oh, excuse me,

20:10.008 --> 20:12.730
but do you think people want the tacquitos as they walk in?

20:13.800 --> 20:19.694
No, no, what I think that you should do is make this as casual as possible

20:19.744 --> 20:24.571
so it doesn't end up looking like some sort of ...Mexican bar Mitzvah.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.432
OK?

20:29.300 --> 20:30.000
Hello?

20:31.700 --> 20:32.618
Warren --

20:33.800 --> 20:36.937
Yeah, I'm sorry that I left without saying goodbye,

20:37.200 --> 20:40.066
- it's just that...
- I was hoping for a morning, you know, a moment,

20:40.116 --> 20:42.498
so that the, ah, the situation could be assessed.

20:42.548 --> 20:45.272
Oh, no, there's no situation. Don't worry.

20:45.322 --> 20:48.456
If there was a sense that I had taken advantage of you in any way...

20:48.506 --> 20:50.162
No, no, no, no, no. Nobody took advantage

20:50.212 --> 20:53.052
because what happened last night was nothing.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.283
OK?

20:54.900 --> 20:55.838
OK.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.479
Jonathan?

20:58.529 --> 21:00.834
- Jonathan?
- Jonathan! Oh!

21:01.350 --> 21:03.113
Oh God.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.428
(laughing)

21:05.100 --> 21:08.500
Oh God.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.940
It's the phone thing. It was too insufficient,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.973
whole country between us, getting in the way.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.737
No, It's hard, the phones,

21:15.751 --> 21:19.434
the time zones and the bad timing.

21:19.484 --> 21:21.671
Yeah, right, so after we talked last night, I

21:21.949 --> 21:25.300
thought "Screw it, God make airplanes for a reason, I wanna connect with my girl."

21:28.300 --> 21:29.377
You're getting good...

21:29.800 --> 21:30.749
on the show.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.754
Am I?

21:33.200 --> 21:35.100
I was wrong not to support you

21:35.300 --> 21:36.818
when you thinking of doing this, and

21:36.868 --> 21:37.556
you were right.

21:37.606 --> 21:43.748
It was unfair of me to make it an either/or proposition; the job or me, L.A. or New York.

21:43.748 --> 21:46.836
Are you going to ask me to marry you again?

21:46.886 --> 21:48.137
-Because ---
- No.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.300
I was about to say I love you.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.087
I'm ready to move out here,

21:54.050 --> 21:54.891
make a life.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.256
Wow!

21:59.400 --> 22:00.894
Well, lucky me!

22:02.907 --> 22:03.637
I get the guy!

22:11.200 --> 22:12.276
Go on in, Honey.

22:12.326 --> 22:13.813
She's going, Sarah. Just give her a second.

22:14.300 --> 22:18.228
You know, Grandma threw this whole party just so you and Coop could go swimming.

22:18.278 --> 22:19.560
But I don't wanna.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.007
You don't wanna go in, you don't have to go in.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.553
Yeah. It's fine, honey.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.222
(She's going in).

22:32.200 --> 22:35.565
All right, the only reason I'm not drinking tonight is alcohol's my gateway to pills.

22:35.615 --> 22:38.634
My problem is people are my gateway to alcohol.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.390
Word.

22:42.700 --> 22:43.684
Oh, crap.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.506
What?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.363
What is it?

22:50.959 --> 22:51.475
What?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.819
Oh my. That's her, isn't it?

22:54.919 --> 22:57.321
That's her, she's the one, that's Dad's...

22:57.371 --> 22:58.543
How do you know?

23:04.300 --> 23:07.554
Holly! You came! I can't believe it!

23:08.095 --> 23:12.200
I invited her for you!... I'm so glad you got my message.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.900
Thanks. Thanks for inviting me.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.693
You look lovely. So, did you have a hard time finding the place?

23:20.901 --> 23:22.089
You force me to tell you and

23:22.139 --> 23:24.013
you tell me not to tell like I'm three years old!

23:24.063 --> 23:26.810
Justin, Sarah and I were having a very important talk.

23:26.860 --> 23:30.034
- It was too much for me!
- Too much, Kitty? You want to know what's too much?

23:30.084 --> 23:32.577
She's here! Mom invited her here!

23:33.700 --> 23:34.700
What do you mean she's here?

23:34.800 --> 23:38.020
I mean, she's out there drinking mojitoess and wearing big jewelry!

23:39.500 --> 23:41.507
Oh my God, and Mom asked her to come?

23:41.557 --> 23:43.822
Yeah, so she could, like, hook her up with Uncle Saul!

23:43.872 --> 23:46.710
Oh my God, before or after he has a heart attack?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.033
He certainly deserves to.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.580
So, what are you gonna do about Jonathan?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.053
- What do you mean? 
- Are you gonna tell him?

23:52.519 --> 23:55.536
- About Dad?
- No, about you and cheese-fest from your show.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.000
Kitty?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.174
Ah! One sec. How do you know about cheese-fest?

23:59.224 --> 24:01.343
Kevin told me. We were having a very important talk.

24:01.393 --> 24:01.900
Kitty...

24:04.700 --> 24:06.082
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:06.132 --> 24:08.207
Hey! I'll, ah, see you guys downstairs.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.366
Hmm, fun party, huh?

24:12.500 --> 24:13.341
Yeah.

24:13.900 --> 24:14.742
Yeah.

24:16.900 --> 24:17.559
Tell me, Holly,

24:17.609 --> 24:20.580
what on earth were you thiking showing up here like this? Why didn't you call me last night?

24:21.439 --> 24:22.899
This place is like a mad house

24:22.949 --> 24:25.852
She invited me here for some reason. Let's go with it.

24:25.902 --> 24:28.651
Look! The two of you together. Saulie, you need a drink.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.649
- Here you go, Holls. Here you are!
- Thanks.

24:30.699 --> 24:32.716
And, please, I hope you have bug spray on.

24:32.766 --> 24:34.400
There are pests.

24:35.474 --> 24:41.627
What an extraordinary place this is. It's so full of life, so hmm....

24:41.827 --> 24:42.908
so lovely.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.514
So alive!

24:45.400 --> 24:47.893
Yes, it's definitely alive.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.932
You're right, you know, we could do a thing,

24:49.982 --> 24:53.177
you know, sometimes...oh, meet in the middle of the country,

24:53.227 --> 24:54.228
say Chicago,

24:54.278 --> 24:56.304
so neither one of us has to fly back and forth.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.200
Warren!

24:59.400 --> 25:00.151
Hey, look, I--

25:00.200 --> 25:04.690
So, you know, I think that's probably the only way we're gonna make it work, right?

25:04.740 --> 25:06.290
Kitty, ah --

25:06.797 --> 25:09.864
Oh. Right.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.609
Hi, Warren.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.526
Come on in, I guess.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.059
Thanks.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.776
My Mom must have invited you, right?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.955
Yup, yeah.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.148
Jon Vaughan, Hi. Kitty's fiance.

25:25.198 --> 25:27.428
Warren Salter, Kitty's nemesis.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.449
Does anybody need a drink?

25:31.200 --> 25:32.390
I do.

25:36.700 --> 25:40.022
Just tell me what to do about these Roweka people and I'll do it.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.543
Oh, I don't know, Sarah. You're probably right.

25:42.593 --> 25:45.561
Well, obviously I'm not right if it means going to court over these idiots!

25:45.661 --> 25:46.316
You think so?

25:47.186 --> 25:50.300
OK, if they wanna play Concentration all day, fine!

25:50.500 --> 25:53.199
They can play Concentration, you can, too, I don't care!

25:53.249 --> 25:55.767
But, we can't afford to start over again with the packaging.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.165
If somebody wasn't threatening to sue us,

25:58.215 --> 26:00.264
would you be having this conversation right now?

26:00.264 --> 26:02.193
Well, no, because there wouldn't be a problem.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.296
Yes, there would be! Us!

26:05.900 --> 26:07.028
Honey, could you --

26:09.400 --> 26:11.824
Look, I'll take care of this.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.559
I mean, I'm so sick of the way you don't respect me!

26:14.559 --> 26:16.039
You never have and I know that,

26:16.039 --> 26:17.532
but at least when you worked at Northland,

26:17.582 --> 26:21.601
- I didn't have it shoved in my face every-- single day!
- Tom, I'm just trying to save the company!

26:21.651 --> 26:23.711
Yeah, exactly! "I'm" just trying.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.396
Not "we."

26:27.200 --> 26:28.400
(sighs)

26:30.500 --> 26:32.817
Red velvet cupcakes.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.300
Oh, wow,

26:34.500 --> 26:38.124
that's, that's really nice of you

26:38.710 --> 26:40.057
Thank you, Scotty.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
My own recipe.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.839
Look, I just wanna be real clear with you, OK?

26:43.889 --> 26:46.168
My sister invited you here to get back at me.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.899
For what? Being so cute?

26:48.600 --> 26:52.888
eah, yeah, that and-and refusing to be her tool. You see,

26:52.888 --> 26:54.298
she's fighting with my brother and I

26:54.348 --> 26:57.132
- wouldn't be tricked into taking sides.
- Oh, so you don't want me here?

26:57.698 --> 26:58.806
It's-...

26:59.200 --> 27:01.356
It's wildly unprofessional, OK?

27:01.406 --> 27:02.500
You know, the witness at the pool party.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.686
It's not how you win cases.

27:04.786 --> 27:07.764
Well, I'm more than just the witness at a pool party.

27:07.814 --> 27:10.199
I'm Scotty Wandell from Oxford, Mississippi.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.794
Son of Wally and Bertha.

27:11.844 --> 27:13.599
There's a Wally Wandell?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.185
- Yes.
- Wow.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.200
Whatever you think of me--

27:17.400 --> 27:18.918
I don't think anything of you, Warren.

27:18.968 --> 27:21.764
It's-It's just that this is just the worst possible time to --

27:21.814 --> 27:25.394
I know you think I'm just some sort of sexual cynic with-with good hair, but -- you're at least 10% wrong.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.457
No, I don't. I don't-- You're not that bad, Warren. It's just that--

27:28.500 --> 27:31.200
- Oh, hi. Please, can I have a mojito?
- Two.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.373
I thought that there was something, last night.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.449
Warren, there is so much going on in this house right now

27:37.449 --> 27:38.094
that I can't do this.

27:38.144 --> 27:42.429
- Yes, we slept together. It is what it is.
- No, you're wrong.

27:42.450 --> 27:43.807
About me, anyway.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.221
You don't know me, Kitty,

27:45.648 --> 27:48.038
but you're the first woman I've met in years who sends me spinning.

27:48.534 --> 27:51.898
I see you and I drop ten stories inside, everytime.

27:51.948 --> 27:52.663
Oh, Warren, you know what?

27:52.713 --> 27:55.250
We're not in the last ten minutes of a Julia Roberts movie.

27:55.253 --> 27:59.600
Let's just talk at work, and tonight, let's just relax.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.500
- Hi.
- Hey. You guys fighting about borders again?

28:04.300 --> 28:06.617
Warren, I'm gonna take my girl from you.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.150
I haven't seen her in a few weeks.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.115
- And that's your dad.
- Of course.

28:19.165 --> 28:22.390
Yup. the Unknowable King.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.283
A leader of men?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.051
No, not really. As it turns out, just a man.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.831
And one who has, after his passing, been causing us all a great deal of trouble.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
May I ask?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.441
No you may not, you're just the witness...

28:38.200 --> 28:40.360
but its what men do right?

28:40.900 --> 28:44.564
And speaking as a gay one I've never been able to master the art of being faithful.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.931
Oh. That.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.560
That's too bad.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.434
But then you can't be faithful to anything until you know why you should.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.481
I don't know, Paige. What do you think?

29:07.100 --> 29:08.648
Grandpa died in this pool.

29:09.300 --> 29:09.963
Yeah.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.624
And you think if you go in, you'll die, too?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.459
No, it just makes me sad.

29:18.188 --> 29:20.368
I haven't been in a pool since it happened, either, you know?

29:22.500 --> 29:23.862
Just like you.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.540
Honey, can you hold this?

29:30.700 --> 29:31.565
Sure.

29:32.700 --> 29:33.346
And this.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.130
What are you doing?

29:36.500 --> 29:38.257
You just helped me figure something out.

29:38.700 --> 29:39.589
I'll see you later.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.923
How is it?

29:50.400 --> 29:51.345
Come in and find out.

29:59.425 --> 30:00.136
You ready?

30:13.259 --> 30:15.150
You know, my kids are teaching me this thing now with the TV

30:15.152 --> 30:19.113
where you can record anything, and I put Holly's name in and

30:19.113 --> 30:20.400
- she was on Charlie's Angels,
- Oh!

30:20.494 --> 30:23.098
- at four o'clock this morning.
- That's stunning, Nora.

30:23.148 --> 30:24.967
Oh, that must have been so much fun!

30:25.100 --> 30:27.720
- So, you were never married or anything?
- No.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.614
- Seeing anyone special?
- Maybe the woman doesn't want to be peppered.

30:30.803 --> 30:33.263
- Oh, Saulie, Saulie, Saulie.
- You're peppering her with questions!

30:33.313 --> 30:34.325
We're buddies already. I mean,

30:34.375 --> 30:36.769
she's been living in a house of ours all these years.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.942
There is a decorator in Malibu,

30:38.992 --> 30:41.614
but I think he only likes me because of my eye.

30:41.614 --> 30:42.907
Oh, Oh, Oh...

30:43.100 --> 30:45.779
She does have beautiful eyes, doesn't she?

30:46.000 --> 30:46.813
I'll be back.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.465
Who's gonna tell Mom?

30:52.963 --> 30:57.254
Well, I don't see why everybody's in such a big rush to tell her. Why don't we just keep it a secret forever?

30:57.304 --> 30:58.863
There's Daddy's Little Girl!

30:58.913 --> 31:01.390
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- What's going on in here?

31:03.172 --> 31:04.086
This is a party.

31:04.186 --> 31:06.300
While you guys are in here ruining your appetites,

31:06.500 --> 31:08.400
the rest of us are out there waiting patiently.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.610
Why don't we all go outside and sit down

31:10.660 --> 31:12.699
so these wonderful can do their job?

31:12.747 --> 31:14.703
I apologize for my children. Come on!

31:14.753 --> 31:16.222
Come on, come on, move it!

31:19.400 --> 31:22.267
I do think they will eventually be put on trial. I mean,

31:22.317 --> 31:24.796
how long can you continue to break the law?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.734
Could someone pass the mango peach salsa?

31:34.300 --> 31:34.900
Nora?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.835
Yes. Would you care for some more lamb?

31:37.200 --> 31:38.790
No, thank you. What's going on?

31:38.800 --> 31:39.509
What do you mean?

31:39.559 --> 31:41.391
Why isn't anyone but us talking?

31:43.100 --> 31:43.917
Oh...

31:47.000 --> 31:48.897
Well, they all think that I don't know that

31:48.947 --> 31:52.402
my husband had an affair with that woman, Holly, over there

31:52.452 --> 31:53.092
along with

31:53.100 --> 31:55.981
a cunning little cottage built for two to go with it.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.047
Yes, Warren, you see, they all think that I'm living in the dark

32:02.097 --> 32:04.730
and they're all terrified that I'm gonna figure it all out tonight

32:04.730 --> 32:07.284
and in their panic and obliviousness

32:07.334 --> 32:09.498
and their eagerness to handle me,

32:09.548 --> 32:14.520
they've lost their very basic ability to conduct themselves in a social circumstance.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.817
It's very sad,

32:19.000 --> 32:19.714
but there it is.

32:33.567 --> 32:38.982
Would someone please pass the mango peach salsa to Scotty?

32:41.300 --> 32:42.300
Thank you.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.212
I mean, what has my life been?

32:59.500 --> 33:00.210
Hmm?

33:00.300 --> 33:02.732
I have waited and I have waited

33:02.732 --> 33:04.293
and now, this man --

33:04.300 --> 33:05.800
Holly, come on. Calm down. This --

33:05.850 --> 33:07.863
No! You know, the thing is...

33:08.100 --> 33:11.360
I don't blame him. I blame myself.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.625
We can't help who we love.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.529
Yeah, but we can help who we are.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.677
We can decide to become ourselves.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.924
What I saw tonight --

33:23.500 --> 33:26.114
seeing myself in Nora's eyes --

33:26.400 --> 33:27.463
is not--

33:30.700 --> 33:32.215
It is time

33:33.200 --> 33:34.837
that I become a person.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.190
I won't be invisible any longer.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.789
Well, that was an interesting

33:52.700 --> 33:56.415
hour and ten minutes of unmitigated torture

33:57.300 --> 33:59.200
and toquitoes.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.910
I'm sorry.

34:01.910 --> 34:04.032
Oh, no, Mom, don't be sorry.

34:04.032 --> 34:05.742
- It was necessary.
- Yeah.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.261
How long have you known?

34:09.300 --> 34:10.896
Fifteen years.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.121
Oh, God, Mom.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.542
I caught him in a lie one day and it all came out.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.516
He said he would stop, he said it was...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.326
over already for God's sakes.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.350
And then he went and he bought her a house.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.375
That's the part that drives me crazy.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.514
He said he would stop and he went on betraying, he said

34:37.565 --> 34:40.922
he would stop and he went on doing it. If

34:40.972 --> 34:41.800
I'd known --

34:42.000 --> 34:43.534
He did love you, though.

34:44.800 --> 34:45.632
He did.

34:45.683 --> 34:48.947
But, he didn't give up anything to do it.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.646
What kind of love is that?

34:56.500 --> 34:58.799
The minute I saw that deed,

35:00.239 --> 35:02.588
I knew that it had never ended.

35:04.726 --> 35:06.435
I wanted her to feel as

35:06.485 --> 35:09.900
small and stupid as I did.

35:17.092 --> 35:20.429
I'm so ashamed of myself!

35:20.500 --> 35:23.014
But, God! It felt good!

35:28.500 --> 35:30.002
Kitty, you have to tell Jonathan

35:30.052 --> 35:31.044
you slept with Warren.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.751
Who told you?

35:46.500 --> 35:48.038
You all right?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.252
Not really.

35:53.395 --> 35:54.708
So, do you wanna talk about it?

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
No.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.064
I just hope when you look at me, you see

36:02.064 --> 36:04.299
someone that's more like my mother.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.705
....my father.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.942
I don't see either.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.902
I see the woman I love.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.519
The woman you love is a mess.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.752
The legend has fallen.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.771
Your secret ends.

36:28.317 --> 36:29.839
Not such a secret.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.301
Not such a mess.

37:08.071 --> 37:09.078
Hi.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.014
Hi.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.326
I need to tell you something.

37:16.210 --> 37:17.192
You slept with him?

37:19.600 --> 37:20.429
Yeah.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.676
But I was drunk and

37:23.800 --> 37:25.059
it was a mistake, and ...

37:25.109 --> 37:27.571
- Kitty...
- I had just found out about my father's infidelity...

37:27.621 --> 37:28.713
- and I...
- Kitty, stop.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.500
There's no excuse that matters. None.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.466
Jonathan, please tell me that I have another chance with you.

37:39.207 --> 37:43.810
The "us" that I saw today was so much better than the "me" that I was last night, and --

37:47.900 --> 37:50.033
I just lost you forever, didn't I?

37:52.500 --> 37:53.899
I think so, yeah.

38:25.312 --> 38:25.999
Saul?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.827
I was trying to spare you more pain.

38:33.900 --> 38:34.596
I know that.

38:36.000 --> 38:36.925
I know.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.581
I signed the deed.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.414
Sell it to her, for a reasonable price.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.012
She should have at least that.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.506
Nora, you understand what I....

38:49.800 --> 38:51.543
I was trying to protect --

38:51.900 --> 38:53.006
I'm not mad.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.100
Honestly, I'm not.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.906
The truth of the matter is, I'm not surprised.

38:59.700 --> 39:03.326
Saulie, you lost your way a long time ago, I know that.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.305
Saul!

39:10.700 --> 39:12.243
You're my big brother.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.484
There's nothing on earth you could do to make me not love you.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.476
Promise me one thing, though.

39:22.100 --> 39:25.062
Promise me there's nothing else you're not telling me.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.199
I promise.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.547
The problem with this administration, Jack,

39:33.597 --> 39:35.583
is that there is no end to the intrigue.

39:35.633 --> 39:36.960
It does make it entertaining, though.

39:37.010 --> 39:39.430
Well, except that politics is not entertainment.

39:39.430 --> 39:42.017
- Can I make my point?
- Yes, Warren. By all means.

39:42.017 --> 39:47.900
There isn't a single controversy or scandal that they haven't put to rest that hasn't resurfaced looking ten times worse!

39:48.100 --> 39:50.205
They think that they can hide things and they can't!
