Oh!

28:56.125 --> 28:58.388
You little shits,
I'â€™m going to...

28:58.432 --> 29:00.695
You motherf--

29:00.739 --> 29:02.001
Uh...

29:02.044 --> 29:04.568
â™ª

29:04.612 --> 29:06.701
Um, hi.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.355
Hi.

29:08.398 --> 29:11.053
I'â€™m sorry, I, uh,

29:11.097 --> 29:14.796
I just thought that you were--
it doesn'â€™t matter.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.190
Um, can I, can I help you?

29:17.233 --> 29:20.280
Yeah, um, I just live
down the hall.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.629
I'â€™m Lisa.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.239
Um, Jason.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.937
Nice to meet you, Jason.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.591
â™ª

29:27.635 --> 29:31.247
Um, I was just wondering,
I don'â€™t usually do this,

29:31.291 --> 29:33.336
but I ran out
of a coffee grounds

29:33.380 --> 29:37.079
and I was hoping to
maybe steal some of yours.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.908
I didn'â€™t have a chance to
go out earlier and get them,

29:39.952 --> 29:41.649
and it'â€™d be really great

29:41.692 --> 29:43.825
if I could have them
for the morning.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.435
Uh, yeah.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.785
Um, come on in.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.917
I'â€™m sure I've got some
you can steal.

29:48.961 --> 29:51.746
Okay, thank you.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.096
So how long have you
been in the building?

29:54.140 --> 29:56.751
Oh, quite a while now, I guess.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.976
Weird we haven'â€™t run
into each other yet.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.456
Yeah, I'â€™ve seen you around.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.936
Really?

30:09.503 --> 30:11.070
Yeah, but in your defense,

30:11.113 --> 30:15.074
you sort of seem to be
in your own world sometimes.

30:17.032 --> 30:19.556
Yeah, I'â€™m kind of--

30:19.600 --> 30:22.908
kind of live
in my head sometimes.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.692
Um, what about--

30:24.735 --> 30:27.129
maybe I'â€™ve seen, uh,

30:27.173 --> 30:29.436
your husband?

30:29.479 --> 30:31.830
Uh, no, it'â€™s just me.

30:43.189 --> 30:46.627
Um, you know,
if you don'â€™t have any,

30:46.670 --> 30:48.455
it'â€™s okay, I can just--

30:48.498 --> 30:50.761
No, no, I know I have some
around here somewhere,

30:50.805 --> 30:54.026
I just--I don'â€™t know.

30:54.069 --> 31:03.513
â™ª

31:03.557 --> 31:05.559
Yeah, yeah, I'â€™ve...

31:05.602 --> 31:10.216
â™ª

31:10.259 --> 31:12.000
...got lots.

31:12.044 --> 31:20.704
â™ª

31:20.748 --> 31:23.142
I don'â€™t need that much.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.839
No, no, go on.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.406
Trust me, I actually--

31:26.449 --> 31:29.148
I have, I have tons.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.584
Are you sure?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.934
Yeah, it'â€™s all yours.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.284
Okay, thank you.

31:35.328 --> 31:38.853
â™ª

31:38.897 --> 31:41.856
Um, what'â€™s that all about?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.989
Uh, what?

31:44.032 --> 31:49.298
The cards and the tacks
and all that.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.954
Oh, um, that'â€™s just,

31:52.998 --> 31:54.869
that'â€™s just something
I'â€™m working on.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.610
Huh.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.177
What do you do?

31:58.220 --> 32:00.222
Um, I'â€™m a writer.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.963
A screenwriter, actually.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.618
Oh, like movies.

32:04.661 --> 32:08.187
Yeah, like, like movies.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.973
That'â€™s interesting.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.757
What are you writing about?

32:13.801 --> 32:15.107
Um, well, I just, I just--

32:15.150 --> 32:18.675
it'â€™s something I've been

32:18.719 --> 32:20.982
just thinking about
for a little while.

32:21.026 --> 32:24.812
I'â€™m actually almost done
with the first draft.

32:24.855 --> 32:27.989
So is the plot
like a secret or...

32:28.033 --> 32:29.817
No, no, it'â€™s not.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.646
I'â€™m just--I'm pretty terrible.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.387
Uh...

32:34.430 --> 32:37.868
I just--suck at explaining
the shit that I write about.

32:37.912 --> 32:41.568
It'â€™s--wouldn't do it
any justice.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.136
You just kind of
have to read it and then,

32:44.179 --> 32:46.877
and then it makes sense.

32:46.921 --> 32:50.142
Or at least I hope
it makes sense.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.013
Well, uh,

32:52.057 --> 32:55.103
maybe when you'â€™re done
writing it, I could,

32:55.147 --> 32:56.539
I could read it.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.107
Yeah, um, maybe.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.979
Yeah, maybe you can.

33:01.022 --> 33:07.028
â™ª

33:07.072 --> 33:09.552
Okay, well, I should get going.

33:09.596 --> 33:12.207
â™ª

33:12.251 --> 33:14.427
Thank you for this.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.168
You'â€™re a lifesaver.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.256
Any time.

33:17.299 --> 33:20.346
Um, just...

33:20.389 --> 33:23.958
don'â€™t be afraid to ask
if you need anything.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.873
Don'â€™t be shy.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.266
I won'â€™t.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.921
â™ª

33:30.965 --> 33:32.923
Oh, hey.

33:32.967 --> 33:35.187
Um, I know this
might sound strange

33:35.230 --> 33:37.711
but have you seen a cat
wandering around out here?

33:37.754 --> 33:39.060
A cat?

33:39.104 --> 33:41.541
-Yours?
-No, I just--

33:41.584 --> 33:44.848
I think there'â€™s one stuck
in the ventilation.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.981
Can'â€™t say I have.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.896

close to finishing it.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.353
You have that
ending figured out?

34:55.397 --> 34:58.705
Yeah, the ending?

Okay.

35:47.319 --> 35:50.191
Well, I should get back at it.

I am.

you wanna come over there,

48:34.999 --> 48:37.001
Can I bring anything?

48:37.044 --> 48:40.047
Um, just you.

48:40.091 --> 48:41.614
You would totally be like

48:41.657 --> 48:43.616
fist-pumping in the air
right now

48:43.659 --> 48:46.880
if I wasn'â€™t still standing here,
wouldn'â€™t you?

48:46.924 --> 48:49.361
I'â€™m, um, just,

48:49.404 --> 48:51.667
I'â€™m just gonna go.

48:51.711 --> 48:53.931
Okay, smooth operator.

48:53.974 --> 48:56.368
[door creaking]

48:59.284 --> 49:09.207
â™ª

49:12.036 --> 49:14.473
[clanging]

49:14.516 --> 49:24.439
â™ª

49:37.844 --> 49:40.064
[knocking]

49:40.107 --> 49:41.543
Shit.

49:41.587 --> 49:51.510
â™ª

49:56.645 --> 49:57.864
Hey.

49:57.907 --> 49:59.213
Hi.

50:01.476 --> 50:03.174
You look great.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.045
Thank you.

50:05.089 --> 50:07.743
You too.

50:07.787 --> 50:10.050
Uh, here.
I'â€™m not sure what you're making

50:10.094 --> 50:13.749
but I'â€™ve been told
that goes with everything.

50:13.793 --> 50:16.361
I'â€™m sure it does.

50:18.145 --> 50:21.409
Uh, uh, I'â€™m sorry, come on in.

50:21.453 --> 50:24.847
Thanks.

50:24.891 --> 50:28.199
[door squeaking]

50:28.242 --> 50:30.288
Ah yeah, come on in.

50:30.331 --> 50:32.725
Make yourself comfortable.

50:32.768 --> 50:36.685
I still have a few things
to finish up in the kitchen.

50:39.601 --> 50:44.302
What?

50:44.345 --> 50:47.609
Uh, no it'â€™s just exactly
the same...

50:49.524 --> 50:52.484
Is there something
wrong with the wine?

50:52.527 --> 50:55.487
No, no, no.
This is--this is perfect.

50:55.530 --> 50:57.793
Exactly what
I would have chosen.

50:57.837 --> 50:59.447
Now go ahead
and make yourself comfortable.

50:59.491 --> 51:02.276
Grab a seat and I will
get us some glasses.

51:02.320 --> 51:11.677
â™ª

51:19.641 --> 51:22.079
[sighing]

51:22.122 --> 51:25.560
â™ª

51:25.604 --> 51:27.432
So did you finish it?

51:27.475 --> 51:29.173
Pardon?

51:29.216 --> 51:30.565
Your script.

51:30.609 --> 51:33.264
Did you finish writing it?

51:33.307 --> 51:35.396
I did.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.442
Actually,
finished it late last night.

51:37.485 --> 51:40.271
â™ª

51:40.314 --> 51:42.882
Hmm.

51:42.925 --> 51:45.841
You must be happy about that.

51:45.885 --> 51:48.453
Yeah, I am.

51:48.496 --> 51:50.542
It'â€™s a bit of a miracle every
time I finish one.

51:50.585 --> 51:52.239
Hm.

51:56.635 --> 51:59.638
So Mr. Screenwriter,

51:59.681 --> 52:01.988
have I possibly seen anything

52:02.031 --> 52:03.990
that you'â€™ve written?

52:04.033 --> 52:06.601
Uh, well, that depends.

52:06.645 --> 52:08.386
Depends on what?

52:08.429 --> 52:12.216
Are you a fan a low budget,
B horror movies

52:12.259 --> 52:17.090
without any discernable stars?

52:17.134 --> 52:21.138
Um, no, not really.

52:21.181 --> 52:23.662
Yeah, then I highly doubt it.

52:23.705 --> 52:25.272
Thank you.

52:25.316 --> 52:26.534
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

52:26.578 --> 52:28.841
[clinking]

52:30.364 --> 52:32.714
Is that it?

52:32.758 --> 52:37.502
Um, yeah, that'â€™s it.

52:37.545 --> 52:39.373
Can I see it?

52:39.417 --> 52:41.158
Yeah, yeah, sure.

52:41.201 --> 52:44.944
â™ª

52:44.987 --> 52:47.903
Ending needs some work but um,

52:47.947 --> 52:52.952
I'â€™m never really totally
satisfied with my writing.

52:52.995 --> 52:54.475
I guess that'â€™s a good thing
though

52:54.519 --> 52:57.086
or wouldn'â€™t really be
a point would there.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.393
A little OCD I guess.

52:59.437 --> 53:01.700
But if I just keep picking apart

53:01.743 --> 53:05.530
I'â€™ll never finish.

53:05.573 --> 53:07.009
Um.

53:07.053 --> 53:10.230
I'â€™m just gonna
check on the food.

53:10.274 --> 53:12.537
Are--Do you want any help?

53:12.580 --> 53:13.886
No, no, no.

53:13.929 --> 53:15.017
You just sit there and relax.

53:15.061 --> 53:18.238
I got everything covered
over here.

53:19.848 --> 53:23.287
So um, what about you?

53:23.330 --> 53:24.462
What about me?

53:24.505 --> 53:26.768
What do you do for a living?

53:26.812 --> 53:29.771
Uh, I'â€™m kind of
between things right now.

53:29.815 --> 53:34.298
Just weighing my options
I guess.

53:34.341 --> 53:38.606
Well, options are always good.

53:38.650 --> 53:41.305
Yeah sometimes.

53:41.348 --> 53:45.047
Sometimes not.

53:46.745 --> 53:48.877
I'â€™ll see.

53:48.921 --> 53:52.620
Yeah, I'â€™m sure
you'â€™ll figure it out.

53:55.841 --> 53:59.061
Hey, uh, you can go on and
put some music on if you want.

53:59.105 --> 54:02.717
I have some vinyl
over there on the shelf.

54:02.761 --> 54:05.329
I'â€™m pretty old school
when it comes to music.

54:05.372 --> 54:07.244
And I apologize, I really
thought I was going to be

54:07.287 --> 54:09.289
further ahead
with this before you got here.

54:09.333 --> 54:11.117
No, it'â€™s okay.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.728
Not like either of us
are going anywhere.

54:13.772 --> 54:14.860
Right.

54:14.903 --> 54:16.340
Are you sure I can'â€™t help?

54:16.383 --> 54:18.733
No, no, go on.

54:18.777 --> 54:20.648
Just bear with me.

54:20.692 --> 54:22.128
Okay.

54:22.171 --> 54:31.790
â™ª

54:48.763 --> 54:51.592
So is there anything
in particular music wise

54:51.636 --> 54:54.116
you like?

54:54.160 --> 54:57.816
No, no I'â€™m good
with everything on there.

54:57.859 --> 55:00.253
Um, your choice.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.256
Okay.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.345
I'â€™m interested
to see what you choose.

55:05.389 --> 55:11.133
â™ª

55:24.364 --> 55:28.803
â™ª

55:28.847 --> 55:29.761
[sizzling]

55:29.804 --> 55:31.589
Ah!

55:31.632 --> 55:33.808
â™ª All this time

55:33.852 --> 55:35.114
Are you okay?

55:35.157 --> 55:39.814
â™ª You have been on my mind

55:39.858 --> 55:43.035
â™ª And all the reasons...

55:45.211 --> 55:47.082
â™ª

55:47.126 --> 55:50.390
I'â€™m sorry, I...

55:50.434 --> 55:51.391
I didn'â€™t mean to.

55:51.435 --> 55:54.394
No, no it'â€™s not your fault.

55:54.438 --> 55:57.528
That was just, uh,
I don'â€™t know what that was.

55:57.571 --> 55:59.965
â™ª

56:00.008 --> 56:06.319
I guess you'â€™re not ready
for this.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.321
I'â€™m going to go.

56:08.365 --> 56:11.411
No, no, no.

56:11.455 --> 56:16.068
Uh, I'â€™m sorry, I'm--.

56:16.111 --> 56:17.461
Don'â€™t go.

56:17.504 --> 56:19.419
Please don'â€™t go.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.464
I don'â€™t know what that was.

56:20.507 --> 56:23.249
That was--there was um...

56:23.292 --> 56:24.468
Really, I'â€™m gonna--

56:24.511 --> 56:28.907
No, no, look, look, don'â€™t go.

56:28.950 --> 56:33.215
This was, look I'â€™m...

56:33.259 --> 56:37.263
I'â€™m not some fucking
crazy nutcase okay.

56:37.306 --> 56:40.092
That was just--let'â€™s just
wipe that clean, all right?

56:40.135 --> 56:44.444
That didn'â€™t--that didn't happen.

56:44.488 --> 56:47.273
Uh, yeah, please just--

56:47.316 --> 56:52.844
Look, don'â€™t go.

56:52.887 --> 56:56.935
Okay, um yeah.

56:56.978 --> 56:58.937
Yeah, I'â€™ll stay.

56:58.980 --> 57:01.461
Okay, good, good, yeah.

57:01.505 --> 57:03.245
â™ª

57:03.289 --> 57:09.034
I promise, rest of the night
won'â€™t be like that.

57:09.077 --> 57:11.732
Okay.

57:17.782 --> 57:19.871
All right.

57:19.914 --> 57:21.742
Hope you'â€™re hungry.

57:21.786 --> 57:29.097
â™ª

57:29.141 --> 57:34.320
Look, I just want to apologize
again for earlier.

57:34.363 --> 57:39.499
To be honest,
I haven'â€™t been on a date in...

57:39.543 --> 57:41.849
[chuckling]

57:41.893 --> 57:44.896
...A while.

57:44.939 --> 57:47.812
Yeah, um, I honestly haven'â€™t

57:47.855 --> 57:50.118
been on a date
in a while either.

57:50.162 --> 57:53.252
So can we just
completely start over then?

57:53.295 --> 57:54.688
Pretend that I'â€™m not
some crazy idiot

57:54.732 --> 57:56.516
that you just met?

57:56.560 --> 57:58.692
Well, you'â€™re not an idiot.

57:58.736 --> 58:02.130
But maybe a little crazy.

58:02.174 --> 58:04.393
I'â€™ll take that.

58:04.437 --> 58:08.354
But...

58:08.397 --> 58:10.182
What?

58:10.225 --> 58:12.576
Never mind actually.

58:12.619 --> 58:16.188
No, no, go on, go on.

58:16.231 --> 58:19.887
I was--I was just gonna say that

58:19.931 --> 58:22.542
you know, if you
have something going on

58:22.586 --> 58:27.416
and you need someone to talk to

58:27.460 --> 58:30.158
it'â€™s okay,
you can talk to me about it.

58:30.202 --> 58:33.031
â™ª

58:33.074 --> 58:36.600
No, honestly, honestly,
it'â€™s the script.

58:36.643 --> 58:38.906
I just get
a little too invested.

58:38.950 --> 58:40.342
I get a little bit neurotic

58:40.386 --> 58:42.649
and it just kind of snowballs.

58:42.693 --> 58:45.086
I'â€™m all right, trust me.

58:45.130 --> 58:46.087
But we should start eating this

58:46.131 --> 58:48.394
or else it'â€™s going to get cold.

58:48.437 --> 58:52.093
White or dark.

58:52.137 --> 58:54.574
Uh, either or.

58:54.618 --> 58:58.970
â™ª

58:59.013 --> 59:03.583
[chuckling]

59:03.627 --> 59:06.978
Uh, I would'â€™ve never guessed
that in a million years.

59:07.021 --> 59:09.850
Yeah, I know.

59:09.894 --> 59:13.506
True story.

59:13.550 --> 59:18.380
I cannot picture you
in that uniform.

59:18.424 --> 59:21.732
-Just can'â€™t.
-Yeah.

59:21.775 --> 59:25.474
-For like almost two years too.
-Wow.

59:25.518 --> 59:29.435
But I do prefer petroleum
transfer technician,

59:29.478 --> 59:31.872
-to be clear.
-Oh right, oh I'â€™m sorry.

59:31.916 --> 59:34.396
I'â€™m sorry that I offended you.

59:34.440 --> 59:35.963
I'â€™m not offended,
I just want to make sure

59:36.007 --> 59:37.965
-you got it right.
-Right, yeah, yeah.

59:38.009 --> 59:39.663
Yeah and let'â€™s not even
get started

59:39.706 --> 59:41.578
on the strip club
cleaning stint.

59:41.621 --> 59:44.015
That was--that was something.

59:44.058 --> 59:47.235
-When the lights came on.
-Ah, gross.

59:47.279 --> 59:48.628
Yeah, there'â€™s a reason
those places are dark.

59:48.672 --> 59:50.499
So what was your title there?

59:50.543 --> 59:53.415
Uh, I had a few
of them actually.

59:53.459 --> 59:56.854
Tell me them all.

59:56.897 --> 59:59.596
No. No, that'â€™s a bad idea.

59:59.639 --> 1:00:02.424
We don'â€™t want to get
into details with that one.

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:04.296
Oh yeah, the things I'â€™ve done

1:00:04.339 --> 1:00:07.168
to pursue this, uh...

1:00:07.212 --> 1:00:12.826
screenwriting
it'â€™d blow your mind.

1:00:12.870 --> 1:00:15.524
Yeah.

1:00:15.568 --> 1:00:17.135
A little more?

1:00:17.178 --> 1:00:18.615
I'â€™m okay.

1:00:18.658 --> 1:00:21.008
Are you sure?
There'â€™s just a tinch left.

1:00:21.052 --> 1:00:23.271
I'â€™m good.

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:26.753
[pouring]

1:00:30.714 --> 1:00:33.151
Okay, um.

1:00:33.194 --> 1:00:34.282
Your turn.

1:00:34.326 --> 1:00:36.328
My turn.

1:00:36.371 --> 1:00:38.199
What do you mean?

1:00:38.243 --> 1:00:42.334
Well, I feel like I'â€™ve just
been rambling on about myself

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:45.903
and I haven'â€™t heard
anything from you today.

1:00:45.946 --> 1:00:49.994
Tell me something
about yourself.

1:00:50.037 --> 1:00:54.694
I think you probably
know more than you think.

1:00:54.738 --> 1:00:58.089
What'â€™s that supposed to mean?

1:01:01.745 --> 1:01:05.487
Why am I here, Jason?

1:01:09.187 --> 1:01:13.278
Um.

1:01:13.321 --> 1:01:16.281
Well, um.

1:01:16.324 --> 1:01:19.327
I don'â€™t know,
I thought you were nice

1:01:19.371 --> 1:01:22.679
when I met you and...

1:01:22.722 --> 1:01:26.291
I just thought
I'â€™d invite you over.

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:30.121
It felt like we had a bit
of a, I don'â€™t know.

1:01:30.164 --> 1:01:32.123
[nervous chuckling]

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:35.735
I guess...

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:39.130
I guess it'â€™s like, I just felt

1:01:39.173 --> 1:01:41.698
really comfortable with you.

1:01:41.741 --> 1:01:45.702
Like, when you meet somebody
for the first time

1:01:45.745 --> 1:01:50.750
and it feels like...

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:53.840
It feels like you'â€™ve known them
a lot longer.

1:01:55.146 --> 1:01:57.322
I guess.

1:01:57.365 --> 1:02:00.020
Something like that.

1:02:00.064 --> 1:02:09.377
â™ª

1:03:02.909 --> 1:03:12.789
â™ª

1:03:35.899 --> 1:03:37.117
Lisa?

1:03:37.161 --> 1:03:46.779
â™ª

1:04:24.034 --> 1:04:28.516
What are you doing out here?

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.997
Oh hey, where were you?

1:04:31.041 --> 1:04:32.520
I was calling you in there

1:04:32.564 --> 1:04:36.829
and I figured you must'â€™ve.

1:04:36.873 --> 1:04:39.049
Guess I didn'â€™t hear.

Is everything okay?

1:05:05.292 --> 1:05:07.773
Come.

1:05:07.816 --> 1:05:11.255
Sit.

1:05:11.298 --> 1:05:12.865
All right.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:21.961
â™ª

1:05:22.005 --> 1:05:26.270
What'â€™s wrong?

1:05:26.313 --> 1:05:29.795
What is it?

1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:34.843
I think we need
to talk about this.

1:05:34.887 --> 1:05:37.934
â™ª

1:05:37.977 --> 1:05:39.239
Talk.

1:05:39.283 --> 1:05:42.025
Uh-oh.

1:05:42.068 --> 1:05:44.636
Talk about what?

1:05:44.679 --> 1:05:47.944
The truth.

1:05:50.207 --> 1:05:53.427
The truth?

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:58.171
I--I don'â€™t know
what you'â€™re talking about.

1:05:58.215 --> 1:06:02.523
You know what I'â€™m talking about.

1:06:05.091 --> 1:06:08.051
We need to deal with this.

1:06:21.281 --> 1:06:24.067
It'â€™s time to talk about her.

1:06:24.110 --> 1:06:26.460
Her?

1:06:26.504 --> 1:06:30.421
What? Deal with...

1:06:30.464 --> 1:06:35.730
I'â€™m sorry, Lisa,
I don'â€™t understand.

1:06:35.774 --> 1:06:39.821
This isn'â€™t what you think it is.

1:06:39.865 --> 1:06:42.650
This isn'â€™t what I think it is?

1:06:42.694 --> 1:06:47.481
What? Between you and me?

1:06:47.525 --> 1:06:51.703
No, no, this is a good thing.

1:06:51.746 --> 1:06:53.879
Last night was amazing.

This is--this is good.

â™ª

1:07:07.849 --> 1:07:11.766
What really happened
to your wife?

1:07:11.810 --> 1:07:14.073
My wife?

1:07:14.117 --> 1:07:15.944
I'â€™m not married.

1:07:15.988 --> 1:07:19.948
My wife? You think--that'â€™s
what this is all about?

1:07:19.992 --> 1:07:21.689
You think that I'â€™m married?

1:07:21.733 --> 1:07:24.823
No, no, no, no this is--

1:07:24.866 --> 1:07:25.954
don'â€™t take this away.

1:07:25.998 --> 1:07:29.175
This is--this is fine.

1:07:29.219 --> 1:07:31.482
Okay? Everything'â€™s fine.

1:07:31.525 --> 1:07:33.397
Look, if we'â€™re moving too quick,

1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:36.400
if this is too fast
we can slow it down.

1:07:36.443 --> 1:07:39.055
It'â€™s not that.

1:07:46.105 --> 1:07:48.107

1:08:01.338 --> 1:08:03.818
It'â€™s your script.

1:08:03.862 --> 1:08:06.430
No it'â€™s not.

1:08:06.473 --> 1:08:07.822

1:08:07.866 --> 1:08:17.657
â™ª

1:08:22.794 --> 1:08:24.361

This isn'â€™t my script.

1:08:25.362 --> 1:08:27.755
This is--this is blank.

1:08:27.799 --> 1:08:29.756
There'â€™s nothing here.

â™ª

1:27:35.337 --> 1:27:37.687
No, no.

1:27:37.730 --> 1:27:40.516
â™ª

1:27:40.559 --> 1:27:47.958
You need to listen to me,
my love.

1:27:48.001 --> 1:27:49.612
No, you'â€™re not real.

1:27:49.655 --> 1:27:51.353
This isn'â€™t real.

1:27:51.396 --> 1:27:53.180
This isn'â€™t real.

1:27:53.224 --> 1:28:01.972
â™ª

1:29:02.728 --> 1:29:06.297
[birds chirping]

1:29:06.341 --> 1:29:16.133
â™ª

1:29:53.083 --> 1:30:02.527
â™ª

1:30:49.313 --> 1:30:52.490
It'â€™s beautiful, you know.

1:30:56.625 --> 1:30:59.279
You can see them all.

1:30:59.323 --> 1:31:01.934
Everyone you'â€™ve ever loved.

1:31:03.545 --> 1:31:06.112
Your mom.

1:31:06.156 --> 1:31:09.202
Your dad.

1:31:09.246 --> 1:31:13.511
Your friends.

1:31:13.555 --> 1:31:17.514
Me.

1:31:17.559 --> 1:31:21.388
I know it'â€™s hard
but you just have to let go.

1:31:21.432 --> 1:31:23.608
It'â€™s all gone.

1:31:23.652 --> 1:31:29.919
â™ª

1:31:29.962 --> 1:31:34.532
I don'â€™t understand
why you won'â€™t just let go.

1:31:34.576 --> 1:31:39.406
Don'â€™t you want to be with me?

1:31:39.450 --> 1:31:41.278
More than anything.

1:31:41.321 --> 1:31:44.889
â™ª

1:31:44.934 --> 1:31:47.110
But you'â€™re not here.

1:31:47.153 --> 1:31:49.112
You'â€™re gone.

1:31:49.155 --> 1:31:51.984
Is this what you want?

1:31:52.028 --> 1:31:54.552
Look around you.

1:31:54.596 --> 1:31:56.293
The pain.

1:31:56.335 --> 1:31:58.687
The suffering.

1:31:58.730 --> 1:32:02.212
The uncertainty.

1:32:02.255 --> 1:32:04.214
Stop the pain.

1:32:04.257 --> 1:32:08.392
â™ª

1:32:08.434 --> 1:32:12.264
Stop suffering.

1:32:12.309 --> 1:32:14.398
I can'â€™t.

1:32:14.441 --> 1:32:17.401
â™ª

1:32:17.443 --> 1:32:19.490
You told me not to give up.

1:32:19.534 --> 1:32:25.540
â™ª

1:32:25.583 --> 1:32:27.933
I...

1:32:34.636 --> 1:32:38.727
I just need to know one thing.

1:32:38.770 --> 1:32:42.165
What is it that you want?

1:32:44.166 --> 1:32:47.562
What do you want?

1:32:51.609 --> 1:32:53.871
Hope.

1:32:56.179 --> 1:32:58.702
I just want...

1:32:58.746 --> 1:33:00.357
some hope.

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:09.800
â™ª

1:33:42.355 --> 1:33:51.713
â™ª

1:34:02.637 --> 1:34:05.596
[crunching]

1:34:08.294 --> 1:34:11.602
Come on, let'â€™s go.

1:34:14.300 --> 1:34:15.562
Wait.

1:34:15.606 --> 1:34:24.789
â™ª

1:34:31.230 --> 1:34:34.712
[birds chirping]

1:34:34.755 --> 1:34:43.852
â™ª

1:35:05.438 --> 1:35:07.005
Are you real?

1:35:07.049 --> 1:35:16.754
â™ª

1:36:32.090 --> 1:36:34.092
â™ª Daylight is fading

1:36:34.136 --> 1:36:36.702
â™ª

1:36:36.746 --> 1:36:40.184
â™ª Your journey is ending

1:36:40.228 --> 1:36:43.188
â™ª Tell me you'â€™ll never â™ª

1:36:43.232 --> 1:36:45.625
â™ª Come again

1:36:45.669 --> 1:36:48.498
â™ª

1:36:48.541 --> 1:36:50.369
â™ª My heart is heavy

1:36:50.413 --> 1:36:53.068
â™ª

1:36:53.111 --> 1:36:55.112
â™ª From holding

1:36:55.157 --> 1:36:56.853
â™ª So tightly

1:36:56.898 --> 1:37:00.335
â™ª Only a memory

1:37:00.379 --> 1:37:02.468
â™ª Remains

1:37:02.512 --> 1:37:05.036
â™ª

1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.693
â™ª Daylight is fading

1:37:09.736 --> 1:37:13.262
â™ª The leaves have fallen

1:37:13.305 --> 1:37:15.960
â™ª Feeling so cold now

1:37:16.004 --> 1:37:19.529
â™ª Inside my mind

1:37:19.572 --> 1:37:21.618
â™ª

1:37:21.661 --> 1:37:26.101
â™ª Moves with my heartbeat

1:37:26.144 --> 1:37:28.451
â™ª So slowly

1:37:28.494 --> 1:37:33.499
â™ª Retracting till
only a memory â™ª

1:37:33.543 --> 1:37:36.981
â™ª Remains

1:37:37.025 --> 1:37:39.984
â™ª You must go

1:37:40.028 --> 1:37:43.901
â™ª Now

1:37:43.945 --> 1:37:53.519
â™ª Take hold
of all you know now â™ª

1:37:53.563 --> 1:37:55.608
â™ª Cold winds blowing

1:37:55.652 --> 1:37:57.741
â™ª In perfect time

1:37:57.784 --> 1:38:01.876
â™ª To bring you back to me

1:38:01.919 --> 1:38:04.008
â™ª Until then

1:38:04.052 --> 1:38:08.186
â™ª Let me sleep
until the warmth â™ª

1:38:08.230 --> 1:38:14.366
â™ª Of the sun is on our side

1:38:14.410 --> 1:38:24.333
â™ª

1:38:27.858 --> 1:38:29.904
â™ª Shadows are moving

1:38:29.947 --> 1:38:32.558
â™ª

1:38:32.602 --> 1:38:34.647
â™ª The daylight

1:38:34.691 --> 1:38:35.996
â™ª Is fading

1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:39.087
â™ª It takes with it what I

1:38:39.130 --> 1:38:41.698
â™ª Want to hold

1:38:41.741 --> 1:38:44.483
â™ª

1:38:44.527 --> 1:38:49.139
â™ª Will I remember

1:38:49.184 --> 1:38:52.665
â™ª The moments unspoken

1:38:52.709 --> 1:38:55.625
â™ª Hidden beneath

1:38:55.668 --> 1:38:59.934
â™ª Of our scars

1:38:59.977 --> 1:39:06.636
â™ª You must go now

1:39:06.679 --> 1:39:16.428
â™ª Take hold
of all you know now â™ª

1:39:16.472 --> 1:39:20.476
â™ª Cold winds
blow in perfect time â™ª

1:39:20.519 --> 1:39:24.697
â™ª To bring you back to me

1:39:24.741 --> 1:39:26.830
â™ª Until then

1:39:26.873 --> 1:39:31.008
â™ª Let me sleep
until the warmth â™ª

1:39:31.052 --> 1:39:35.969
â™ª Of the sun is on our side

1:39:36.013 --> 1:39:45.501
â™ª
