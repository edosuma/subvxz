01:13.879 --> 01:17.462
Thanks, kids. Now I'd like to speak
to you seriously for a moment.

01:17.633 --> 01:20.883
Yep. This week is the grand opening
of Itchy & Scratchy Land.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.626
The violentest place on Earth.

01:23.806 --> 01:28.800
And to celebrate, for this week only,
we're cutting ticket prices in half.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.689
Kids, you heard the cartoon rat.

01:35.859 --> 01:39.110
If you haven't already run to your
parents begging to go, do it now.

01:39.279 --> 01:42.150
You won't miss anything funny.
I'll just be sitting here...

01:42.324 --> 01:45.325
...reading this grownupsâ€™ newspaper.

01:46.912 --> 01:48.241
Go now.

01:48.455 --> 01:51.575
Dad, remember how you said that
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land...

01:51.750 --> 01:53.410
...would be too damned expensive?

01:53.585 --> 01:55.958
Oh, everything's too damn
expensive these days.

01:56.130 --> 02:01.504
Look at this Bible I just got, 15 bucks.
And talk about a preachy book.

02:01.677 --> 02:04.713
Everybody's a sinner,
except for this guy.

02:04.888 --> 02:08.174
But now Itchy & Scratchy Land
is cutting ticket prices in half.

02:08.350 --> 02:10.888
Can we go, Dad? Can we,
can we, can we? Take it, Lis.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.979
- Can we?
- No, no, no. Ask your mother.

02:16.608 --> 02:20.274
- Mom, guess what.
- We're going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

02:20.446 --> 02:23.316
No. I've already planned our vacation.

02:23.532 --> 02:26.568
We're going to the Highway 9
bird sanctuary.

02:26.744 --> 02:30.409
I understand they've installed
a new bird feeder this year.

02:31.623 --> 02:36.416
It's shaped like a diner.
And it's on this really tall pole.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.629
Mom, Dad, Bart's dead!

02:44.970 --> 02:48.719
That's right. Dead serious about
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.601
You know, Itchy & Scratchy Land
isn't just for kids.

02:52.770 --> 02:55.806
They have a place called
Parents' Island.

02:55.981 --> 03:00.442
Yeah. Dancing, bowling, fashionable
shops, over 100 bars and saloons...

03:00.611 --> 03:03.695
...and a world-class
chemical-dependency center.

03:03.864 --> 03:06.735
TV Town. Hammock Land!

03:06.909 --> 03:09.400
"Recipe-related bumper cars."

03:14.166 --> 03:16.739
Wait a minute. I'm not sure about this.

03:16.919 --> 03:20.584
Every time we've ever gone on vacation,
I end up being horribly embarrassed.

03:20.756 --> 03:24.890
We have a big fight and we come home
more miserable than when we left.

03:24.259 --> 03:27.213
You have to promise me that this
isn't gonna happen this time.

03:27.388 --> 03:32.140
- Embarrassed? What do you mean?
- Well, our trip to the Amish country.

03:32.184 --> 03:34.141
Oh, yes.

03:35.312 --> 03:38.266
Hey, look, Marge.
They're still not fighting back.

03:39.441 --> 03:42.810
I can be a jerk
and no one can stop me.

03:43.612 --> 03:46.200
Even worse was our trip
to Sandy Beach.

03:52.538 --> 03:54.198
Suckers.

03:55.916 --> 03:58.122
Sharkboy!

03:59.545 --> 04:02.166
This year I want us to do things
together as a family.

04:02.339 --> 04:04.379
And get a lot of
good exercise outdoors...

04:04.550 --> 04:07.883
...so we'll have a lot of
wonderful memories of our vacation.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.461
Don't worry, Mom.
We'll make you proud of us.

04:10.639 --> 04:14.851
Lobster hat, fishnet Speedo Jr.,
wheelie shoes...

04:15.190 --> 04:17.110
...invisible-dog leash.

04:18.314 --> 04:19.512
Well, I'm packed.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.150
Remember, every morning,
give a bowl of kibble...

04:22.192 --> 04:25.312
...to Santa's Little Helper.
Do you want me to write this down?

04:25.487 --> 04:28.275
No. I ain't senile, dad blast it.

04:28.449 --> 04:31.700
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye, Grampa.

04:31.243 --> 04:33.912
Wait a minute. What was
that last thing you said?

04:34.790 --> 04:38.159
Grampa's Little Helper? What's that?

04:38.459 --> 04:41.495
Which one of you is the mailman?

04:43.130 --> 04:46.665
Okay, let's make a pact. This is
gonna be the best vacation ever...

04:46.842 --> 04:50.450
...or we'll all agree to disband
and join other families.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.252
Agreed.

04:52.806 --> 04:55.428
The interstate.
Fasten your seatbelts, kids.

04:55.601 --> 04:58.721
We're on our way to
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

05:00.814 --> 05:04.598
Don't worry. I've got an ace
up my sleeve.

05:20.793 --> 05:22.702
- Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?
- No.

05:29.593 --> 05:31.752
Oh, my God. What'll I do?
What'll I do?

05:31.929 --> 05:35.973
What's the matter with you? We don't
have any fruits or vegetables in the car.

05:36.725 --> 05:39.133
The whole trunk's full of them, Marge.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.185
Got any fruits or vegetables?

05:46.902 --> 05:50.353
Hey. Mr. Wimbley, it happened again.

05:50.531 --> 05:54.778
Now to absorb some local color
through the magic of AM radio.

05:55.411 --> 06:00.370
The book of Revelation tells us
to watch for the seven signs of evil.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.201
Sign of evil number four...

06:03.377 --> 06:07.457
Continuing our sign-of-evil countdown,
here's Vanessa Williams.

06:10.759 --> 06:14.342
Haven't we stood in five
different states long enough?

06:14.513 --> 06:16.910
No.

06:25.482 --> 06:27.771
We better find a motel
and stop for the night.

06:27.943 --> 06:32.522
We don't need to do that, Marge.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.239
Glad that wasn't us.

06:41.206 --> 06:44.540
North, south. Nuts to this.

06:44.710 --> 06:48.375
- I'm gonna take a shortcut.
- Homer, no. You're gonna get lost.

06:48.547 --> 06:52.592
Trust me, Marge. With today's
modern cars, you can't get lost.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.298
What with all the silicon chips
and such.

07:05.397 --> 07:09.980
All right, we're here. Let us
never speak of the shortcut again.

07:09.276 --> 07:12.396
Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot.

07:16.951 --> 07:20.402
We're now approaching our final
destination, Itchy & Scratchy Land.

07:20.579 --> 07:24.244
The amusement park of the future
where nothing can possib-lie go wrong.

07:25.501 --> 07:27.244
Possibly go wrong.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.790
That's the first thing
that's ever gone wrong.

07:47.731 --> 07:49.688
One adult and four children.

07:49.858 --> 07:52.650
Do you want to buy some
Itchy & Scratchy money?

07:52.236 --> 07:54.561
- What's that?
- Money that's made for the park.

07:54.738 --> 07:57.739
It works just like regular money,
but it's fun.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.779
- Do it, Dad.
- Well, okay. If it's fun.

08:00.953 --> 08:04.120
Let's see. I'll take $ 1100 worth.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.297
- Cool, that is neato.
- Oh, wow. Cool.

08:17.469 --> 08:19.842
Such a violent motif.

08:20.140 --> 08:23.846
Yeah, but it's just pretend violence,
which is actually beneficial for children.

08:27.896 --> 08:31.348
There's no need to murmur, ma'am.
Here at Itchy & Scratchy Land...

08:31.525 --> 08:34.443
...we're just as concerned
about violence as you are.

08:34.611 --> 08:37.482
That's why we're always careful
to show the consequences...

08:37.655 --> 08:40.741
...of deadly mayhem so that we may
educate as well as horrify.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.616
When do you show the consequences?

08:42.785 --> 08:44.993
On TV, that mouse pulled out
the cat's lungs...

08:45.164 --> 08:46.824
...and played them like a bagpipe.

08:46.999 --> 08:49.288
In the next scene,
the cat's breathing comfortably.

08:49.460 --> 08:50.658
Just like in real life.

08:51.462 --> 08:52.920
Hey, look over there.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.423
- A brain burger with extra pus, please.
- Bart.

08:59.595 --> 09:01.718
- Eyeball stew.
- Homer. We just got here...

09:01.889 --> 09:05.388
...and already I'm mortified beyond
belief by your embarrassing behavior.

09:05.559 --> 09:09.427
I was just ordering a cheeseburger. They
have violent names for everything here.

09:09.605 --> 09:13.188
Oh, I see. All right.

09:14.234 --> 09:18.660
- I'll have the baby guts.
- Lady, you disgust me.

09:19.114 --> 09:20.906
Mom, that's veal.

09:23.994 --> 09:28.656
- You sure she'll have fun here?
- Of course. Babies love the ball room.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.425
Torture Land, Explosion Land...

09:42.596 --> 09:48.848
...Searing Gas Pain Land,
Unnecessary Surgery Land.

09:49.687 --> 09:52.438
Oh, look. It's the 12 noon robot parade.

09:52.606 --> 09:55.180
Hurry up or we'll have
to wait for the 12:05 parade.

10:16.460 --> 10:20.440
Wow, this is so much like
my dreams, it's scary.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.802
Look at that cute little baby ax.

10:29.601 --> 10:32.935
It's cute, but I'm sure it's
very sharp and probably dirty.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.734
Dirty, maybe. Dangerous, hardly.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.391
These are state-of-the-art
animatronic robots.

10:39.570 --> 10:44.232
They have sensors that ensure they only
attack each other, never the guests.

10:58.964 --> 11:03.460
See all that stuff in there, Homer?
That's why your robot never worked.

11:12.728 --> 11:17.105
This is just what I was hoping for,
spending the day together as a family.

11:35.584 --> 11:39.830
You know, part of spending time
together as a family...

11:39.254 --> 11:41.710
...is spending time apart as individuals.

11:41.882 --> 11:43.257
Parents' Island?

11:43.425 --> 11:46.675
I'm sure we'll appreciate each other
more when we meet up at dinner.

11:46.845 --> 11:49.716
Are you kids gonna be all right? Kids?

11:58.315 --> 12:01.980
It is the '70s. Right down
to the smallest detail.

12:02.152 --> 12:04.560
Hey, the bartender even looks
like John Travolta.

12:04.738 --> 12:06.814
Yeah, "looks like."

12:08.367 --> 12:12.661
Look at all this great stuff, Lis.
Cool. Personalized plates.

12:12.830 --> 12:16.827
Barclay, Barry, Bert... Bort?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.625
Come on. "Bort"?

12:18.794 --> 12:22.293
- Mommy, buy me a license plate.
- No. Come along, Bort.

12:22.464 --> 12:25.999
- Are you talking to me?
- No. My son is also named Bort.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.213
- Who are all these characters?
- You're too young to remember...

12:29.388 --> 12:33.338
...the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy
& Friends Hour. They had to have friends.

12:33.517 --> 12:36.518
There's Disgruntled Goat,
Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam.

12:38.772 --> 12:40.231
Oh, yeah. They weren't very funny.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.475
I don't know. Disgruntled Goat
had his moments.

12:58.542 --> 13:04.470
Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's,
where it's constantly New Year's Eve.

13:04.214 --> 13:10.419
Here we go again. Three, two, one.

13:18.103 --> 13:22.397
It must be wonderful to ring in
the new year over and over and over.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.440
Please kill me.

13:41.961 --> 13:45.376
- The babies look unhappy.
- Add more balls.

13:49.760 --> 13:54.137
Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius
behind Itchy and Scratchy...

13:54.306 --> 13:57.509
...loved and cared about almost
all the peoples of the world.

13:57.685 --> 14:00.602
And he in return was beloved
by the world...

14:00.771 --> 14:05.433
...except in 1938, when he was
criticized for his controversial cartoon...

14:05.609 --> 14:08.610
..."Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."

14:08.821 --> 14:13.233
Among his proudest achievements was
the full-length musical Scratchtasia.

15:06.670 --> 15:10.715
Hey, Ma, I'm gonna get me
a picture of this crazy critter.

15:13.719 --> 15:16.800
No flash photography, please.

15:20.351 --> 15:25.130
Roger Meyersâ€™ next full-length feature
was the wildly successful Pinitchio.

15:25.230 --> 15:30.142
Now, you be a good Pinitchio,
and don't you lie.

15:30.319 --> 15:32.691
I promise I will never hurt you.

15:34.323 --> 15:37.739
I wonder if this kind of violence
really does desensitize us.

15:42.706 --> 15:44.782
- Wanna get a snow cone?
- Okay.

15:49.672 --> 15:54.547
So, Mr. Itchy, you think you're
God's gift to women, do you?

15:54.718 --> 15:55.881
Don't do it, Bart.

16:03.894 --> 16:06.183
I just wanted to entertain.

16:07.272 --> 16:10.190
Can you believe I keep
getting away with this?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.107
Officer.

16:19.702 --> 16:22.270
Mop-and-bucket man to the
exit of the Nauseator.

16:22.204 --> 16:24.576
Another jumper on the roof
of T.G.I. McScratchy's.

16:24.748 --> 16:27.418
We need more Bort license plates
in the gift shop.

16:27.584 --> 16:31.840
I repeat, we are sold out
of Bort license plates.

16:33.674 --> 16:35.334
I really wish they wouldn't scream.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.219
- Dad?
- I kicked one of those...

16:41.390 --> 16:44.177
...stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
- Yeah.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.344
There's just no way
to resist it, is there?

16:48.630 --> 16:51.646
I want all five T-shirts to say
"best vacation ever."

16:51.817 --> 16:55.268
Attention, Marge Simpson.
Your son has been arrested.

16:56.488 --> 16:59.158
I'd be terribly embarrassed
if I were that boy's mother.

17:00.451 --> 17:05.657
Attention, Marge Simpson. We've also
arrested your older, balder, fatter son.

17:09.585 --> 17:13.665
I'm so embarrassed, I wish there was
a hole I could just crawl into and die.

17:13.839 --> 17:17.705
- Okay, throw her in the hole.
- Please. It was just a figure of speech.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.464
You've got to listen to me.
Elementary chaos theory tells us...

17:24.641 --> 17:28.556
...that all robots will eventually turn
against their masters and run amok...

17:28.729 --> 17:32.477
...in an orgy of blood and kicking
and the biting with the metal teeth...

17:32.650 --> 17:36.650
...and the hurting and shoving.
- How much time do we have, professor?

17:36.236 --> 17:41.527
According to my calculations, the robots
won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.

17:45.788 --> 17:48.361
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

17:48.582 --> 17:52.331
- I have nothing to say to you.
- But, Marge, I was a political prisoner.

17:52.503 --> 17:56.168
- How are you a political prisoner?
- I kicked a giant mouse in the butt.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.900
Do I have to draw you a diagram?

17:59.593 --> 18:01.965
Oh, for gosh sakes. What now?

18:11.397 --> 18:14.682
Hey, look. This one's coming on to me.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.274
Mr. Robot.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.579
You're wrong about that robot
trying to be your friend.

18:27.746 --> 18:31.198
Lisa, don't contradict your elders.

18:32.292 --> 18:36.753
My hair. You chopped off my hair.
Oh, God, I'm ugly.

18:36.922 --> 18:39.413
I knew we should've gone
to the bird sanctuary.

18:45.970 --> 18:48.300
I need the biggest seed bell you have.

18:48.976 --> 18:51.301
No, that's too big.

18:53.355 --> 18:54.849
A chopper. We're saved.

18:55.607 --> 18:58.312
Hey, you're the guys
who didn't like our capering.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.190
When you get to hell,
tell them Itchy sent you.

19:05.451 --> 19:08.240
Oh, my. It looks like we're doomed.

19:09.371 --> 19:13.618
Back, you robot. Nobody ruins
my family vacation but me.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.584
And maybe the boy.

19:35.731 --> 19:37.439
Dad, the flash must have
scrambled their circuits.

19:37.608 --> 19:41.392
- What are you, the narrator?
- Just keep taking pictures.

19:42.655 --> 19:44.650
I'll get more cameras!

19:47.368 --> 19:48.945
Smashy-smashy.

19:49.161 --> 19:51.450
I don't approve of that.

19:58.170 --> 20:00.922
Hey, mouse. Say cheese.

20:02.508 --> 20:05.592
With a dry, cool wit like that,
I could be an action hero.

20:15.229 --> 20:17.471
Die, bad robots. Die!

20:19.240 --> 20:22.250
- With a dry, cool wit like that...
- Who'd think that visiting...

20:22.194 --> 20:25.278
...Itchy & Scratchy Land would
be our best vacation ever?

20:25.447 --> 20:28.899
- Yeah, best ever.
- Are you two bonkers?

20:29.760 --> 20:32.659
We almost got killed. Not to mention
all the embarrassment I suffered.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.321
But, Mom, it's exactly what
you wanted in a vacation.

20:35.499 --> 20:39.579
It brought us together as a family,
we got a lot of good exercise outdoors...

20:39.753 --> 20:41.710
...and we have so many memories.

20:42.172 --> 20:45.422
You know, you're right.
This truly was the best vacation ever.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.300
Now, let us never speak of it again.

20:48.679 --> 20:52.950
As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner
of the park, I'd like to thank you...

20:52.266 --> 20:54.900
...for stopping the killer robots.

20:54.184 --> 20:56.971
And to show my appreciation,
here are two free passes.

20:57.146 --> 20:59.553
- There are five of us.
- Here are two free passes.

20:59.732 --> 21:03.183
- That's better.
- Man, if this is happening here...

21:03.360 --> 21:06.943
...I hate to think what's happening
in Euro-Itchy & Scratchy Land.

21:10.951 --> 21:14.700
Hello. Itchy & Scratchy Land,
open for business.

21:15.289 --> 21:17.994
Who are you to resist it, huh?

21:18.167 --> 21:21.168
Come on, my last paycheck bounced.

21:21.337 --> 21:23.495
My children need wine.

21:32.970 --> 21:35.150
I hope you realize now that
violence on TV may be funny...

21:35.184 --> 21:38.220
...but it's not so funny when
that violence is happening to you.

21:38.395 --> 21:41.432
But it would be funny to someone
who was watching us.

21:41.607 --> 21:44.312
No, Mom. He's right. Observe.

21:48.572 --> 21:51.858
Oh, my. Lisa, go to your room.

22:47.548 --> 22:49.624
