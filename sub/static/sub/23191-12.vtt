00:48.032 --> 00:50.701
Abolish the tyranny of corsetry.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.547
I heard Mr. Macy was
sending a representative

01:04.581 --> 01:06.482
all the way from New York City.

01:06.517 --> 01:09.352
Miss Heloise told me a man is here

01:09.386 --> 01:11.787
from Harrods in London, England!

01:11.822 --> 01:13.889
I'll be sure to linger around his chair!

01:16.794 --> 01:18.695
Are you nervous, Nicolette?

01:18.729 --> 01:20.696
She's not nervous.

01:20.730 --> 01:23.465
She likes prancing about in her
underclothes for wealthy men.

01:23.499 --> 01:25.767
Ladies,

01:25.802 --> 01:29.338
ladies we're about to begin.

01:29.372 --> 01:31.573
I shouldn't need to impress upon you

01:31.607 --> 01:33.542
the importance of today's events.

01:33.576 --> 01:36.712
No mistakes. Be perfect.

01:45.955 --> 01:48.724
Who let him in?

01:48.758 --> 01:52.060
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

01:52.094 --> 01:54.229
And now we have Charlotte, wearing

01:54.263 --> 01:58.132
the House of Heloise's summer
model, in the traditional style.

01:58.167 --> 02:02.237
For the lady who prefers
to maintain a classic shape,

02:02.271 --> 02:04.605
Italian sateen and coutil,

02:04.639 --> 02:07.141
with baby ribbon and lace trim.

02:07.176 --> 02:09.176
Cordite-filled, with a genuine

02:09.211 --> 02:11.846
padded whalebone busk.

02:11.880 --> 02:16.417
Retail suggested at $1.75.

02:16.451 --> 02:20.087
Nicolette sports our Princess hip corset.

02:20.121 --> 02:24.324
Made in the new erect
form style, you'll notice

02:24.359 --> 02:27.928
the shapely S-curve of her body.

02:27.962 --> 02:30.264
Steam-molded to remove all stretch

02:30.298 --> 02:33.133
from the fabric. Whalebone-filled,

02:33.167 --> 02:35.702
fine French coutil and sateen trim.

02:35.736 --> 02:38.105
Retail suggested

02:38.139 --> 02:40.140
at $3.50.

02:46.046 --> 02:49.849
And now for our pièce de resistance.

02:49.884 --> 02:51.885
My new innovation.

02:51.919 --> 02:55.622
A modern corset for a modern woman.

02:55.656 --> 02:59.225
This corset is not for the
grande dames of society,

02:59.259 --> 03:01.493
nor is it for the woman
of leisure this corset

03:01.528 --> 03:05.564
is for today's woman, who
plays as hard as she works.

03:05.598 --> 03:09.168
A corset as freeing as
the life ahead of her.

03:11.271 --> 03:14.307
This new patented technology

03:14.341 --> 03:17.275
is exclusive to me, and you
are the first to be seeing it.

03:23.015 --> 03:26.217
Oh, dear... No need to panic, everyone.

03:26.252 --> 03:29.220
Please just take your
seats. A tiny interruption.

03:29.255 --> 03:31.824
We will resume immediately.
Please take your seats...

03:38.264 --> 03:40.798
Sir, the victim was a Miss Isabelle Young.

03:40.833 --> 03:43.134
She was standing right
here, modelling a corset

03:43.169 --> 03:46.271
when this brick was
thrown through this window.

03:46.305 --> 03:49.106
She was unfortunately struck
and died shortly thereafter.

03:49.140 --> 03:52.543
George, where is the body?

03:52.578 --> 03:55.412
Sir, it had been removed to
the dressing room. Miss Heloise

03:55.447 --> 03:58.015
did not want to further
distress her guests.

03:58.049 --> 04:00.718
Do we know who threw the brick?

04:00.752 --> 04:03.046
No, sir, although there was
a group of women protestors,

04:03.047 --> 04:04.287
apparently, dress reformers.

04:04.422 --> 04:06.390
They scattered quickly. The lads are trying

04:06.424 --> 04:09.393
- to track them down now.
- Hmm. And this Miss Heloise?

04:09.427 --> 04:12.662
She is the owner of the establishment,
sir. Not entirely a pleasant woman.

04:16.567 --> 04:19.935
Miss Heloise, Detective William Murdoch,

04:19.971 --> 04:22.372
- Toronto Constabulary.
- Detective.

04:22.406 --> 04:24.608
An accident such as this is hardly concern

04:24.642 --> 04:28.144
for the constabulary. Nicolette,

04:28.178 --> 04:31.080
take the Americans more
champagne. Be quick about it.

04:31.115 --> 04:33.416
- Miss Heloise...
- Detective Murdoch.

04:33.450 --> 04:37.487
I am trying to salvage
a very important event.

04:37.522 --> 04:39.889
The future of my business
is riding on its success.

04:39.923 --> 04:42.758
Your presence is making a terrible accident

04:42.792 --> 04:44.894
- much worse.
- I see.

04:44.928 --> 04:47.196
Do you have you any idea who
may have thrown the brick?

04:47.231 --> 04:50.133
None at all. Charlotte, stop that man

04:50.167 --> 04:52.101
from leaving. I will
sell Harrods this season

04:52.136 --> 04:56.338
- if it kills us all.
- None of your guests will be leaving until I'm

04:56.372 --> 04:59.274
good and finished, Miss Heloise,
so there is no need to worry.

04:59.308 --> 05:02.611
Have you received any threats of late?

05:02.646 --> 05:07.115
- No.
- But, Miss Heloise...

05:07.150 --> 05:10.586
- The letter.
- Charlotte. Harrods!

05:10.620 --> 05:13.721
What letter would that be, Miss Heloise?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.092
_

05:27.099 --> 05:29.551
An unfortunate accident, you say.

05:35.152 --> 05:37.143
Cause of death appears to
be this wound to her head.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.714
Yes. Thank you, , Dr. Grace.

05:39.748 --> 05:41.816
Detective, I understand
this woman was modelling

05:41.850 --> 05:43.985
- a corset at the time of death.
- That's correct.

05:44.019 --> 05:47.055
- She isn't wearing one now.
- Oh...

05:47.089 --> 05:50.224
Surely my guests may leave now.

05:50.258 --> 05:52.860
These men represent Mr. Eaton,

05:52.895 --> 05:55.897
Mr. Simpson, Mr. Macy and even Harrods.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.833
They do not take kindly
to being kept prisoner.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.903
Where is the corset this young lady
was wearing at the time of her death?

06:01.937 --> 06:03.904
It is company property and the key piece

06:03.938 --> 06:06.807
- of my current collection.
- It is evidence

06:06.841 --> 06:09.476
in an investigation of a suspicious death.

06:09.511 --> 06:12.680
Suspicious? A brick flew through
the window and hit her on the head.

06:12.714 --> 06:15.015
- We all saw it.
- The corset, Miss Heloise.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.255
Nicolette.

06:29.130 --> 06:31.598
Thank you. Miss Green, is it?

06:31.632 --> 06:35.135
Do you know who may have sent
Miss Heloise the threatening note?

06:35.169 --> 06:39.405
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Thank you.

06:42.809 --> 06:45.478
Do you know of anyone who
may have wished her harm?

06:45.512 --> 06:48.248
There is someone.

06:51.552 --> 06:54.319
Thank you.

06:54.354 --> 06:58.557
Gareth Clarke, Clarke and Co. Corsetry.

07:02.662 --> 07:04.563
Did you write this note?

07:08.135 --> 07:11.703
If I were to threaten Heloise,
I would do it to her face.

07:11.738 --> 07:15.340
And I would never harm
a lovely young model.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.744
You really should be looking
at those annoying protesters.

07:18.778 --> 07:21.580
You believe them to be responsible?

07:21.614 --> 07:23.815
Well, who else? "Corsets are

07:23.849 --> 07:26.384
the devil's torture chamber"
and other such nonsense.

07:26.418 --> 07:28.753
Shrewish things who can't attract a suitor

07:28.788 --> 07:30.922
no matter how tightly they lace.

07:30.956 --> 07:34.942
- Could you describe any of them?
- Unmemorable, except for the ringleader.

07:34.966 --> 07:38.863
She was wearing a straw boater dyed black,

07:38.898 --> 07:41.132
if you can believe such a thing.

07:41.167 --> 07:43.801
Thank you, Mr. Clarke.

07:49.641 --> 07:52.810
Poor thing.

07:52.844 --> 07:56.614
This... this gash on her
head is that what killed her?

07:56.648 --> 08:00.717
It's likely. But I try not
to draw a conclusion until

08:00.751 --> 08:02.786
I have all the facts before me.

08:02.821 --> 08:05.588
And how long until you have all the facts?

08:05.623 --> 08:07.624
Some hours yet.

08:09.627 --> 08:12.462
She had been tight-lacing
for quite some time.

08:12.496 --> 08:16.800
You can feel her organs pushing
into her abdominal cavity.

08:16.834 --> 08:20.403
Her lungs are compressed.

08:20.438 --> 08:23.340
She was likely unable to eat very much.

08:23.374 --> 08:28.378
And I believe at least two
of her ribs are cracked.

08:28.412 --> 08:30.747
Corsets are wretched creations.

08:30.781 --> 08:33.816
I don't wear one myself.

08:33.851 --> 08:37.553
I couldn't imagine not wearing
a corset. I would feel so...

08:37.587 --> 08:40.857
- Free?
- ... Exposed.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.958
And improper, I work with men.

08:42.993 --> 08:45.928
Dr. Grace.

08:45.963 --> 08:49.064
- Miss Moss.
- Detective.

08:49.098 --> 08:51.600
Detective, I wasn't expecting you so soon.

08:51.634 --> 08:54.302
I can assure you that I am
focused on the case at hand.

08:54.337 --> 08:56.605
I should leave you to your work. I'll have

08:56.639 --> 08:59.307
the new pamphlets for
the election tomorrow.

09:04.613 --> 09:09.918
A straw boater dyed black.

09:09.952 --> 09:12.120
I wasn't trying to kill anyone.

09:12.154 --> 09:15.123
I couldn't have known she was standing
there. I was making a statement.

09:15.157 --> 09:18.326
- You did more than that.
- That poor dead girl on the table,

09:18.361 --> 09:20.717
her body warped and twisted
into unnatural shapes,

09:20.718 --> 09:21.530
- all for some farcical idea
- That isn't the point...

09:21.545 --> 09:25.433
- ... of beauty. It's barbaric and outdated thinking.
- Miss Moss.

09:25.567 --> 09:28.235
Why you threw the brick is immaterial.

09:28.270 --> 09:30.742
At best, you will be charged
with destruction of property.

09:30.743 --> 09:32.330
At worst, manslaughter.

09:32.337 --> 09:35.777
Either way, you will be
spending a night in our cells.

09:35.891 --> 09:38.859
Detective...

09:38.893 --> 09:42.363
You must know I...

09:42.397 --> 09:44.831
I didn't wish for anyone to die.

09:48.470 --> 09:50.404
Did you write this note to Miss Heloise?

09:50.438 --> 09:53.307
No.

09:56.919 --> 10:01.222
Simon! What on earth happened to you?

10:01.256 --> 10:03.524
- Nothing.
- Simon.

10:03.559 --> 10:06.795
I saw a penny on the sidewalk

10:06.829 --> 10:08.897
and I thought it was my lucky
day, but when I bent over

10:08.931 --> 10:10.898
to pick it up, some other
kid socked me in the ribs.

10:10.932 --> 10:13.134
- So you got into a fight.
- He hit me first!

10:13.168 --> 10:15.136
It was my penny and he stole
it. What was I supposed to do?

10:15.170 --> 10:18.239
You don't believe me.

10:18.273 --> 10:22.310
- Well, who's this other boy?
- That's him.

10:22.344 --> 10:24.512
Alright, you go on home.
I'll take care of it.

10:24.546 --> 10:27.180
- I can take care of it now!
- Don't rise to it, son!

10:27.215 --> 10:29.617
You're going home right now.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.054
Father, may I have my penny back now?

10:34.089 --> 10:36.389
I'll keep hold of it until
this matter is settled.

10:36.424 --> 10:39.026
But it wasn't my fault! I
was reaching for it first.

10:39.060 --> 10:41.561
I know, I know, I believe
you, Bobby. Higgins,

10:41.596 --> 10:43.796
can you take Bobby and get him cleaned up.

10:43.831 --> 10:47.601
Of course. Come on, Lad.

10:47.635 --> 10:50.604
The blow from the brick
was not the cause of death.

10:50.638 --> 10:52.939
- Then what was?
- Suffocation.

10:52.973 --> 10:55.509
And not blunt force
trauma. Are you quite sure?

10:55.543 --> 10:59.212
Petechial hemorrhaging.

10:59.247 --> 11:01.213
I am quite sure.

11:07.454 --> 11:10.056
Have you determined the
cause of suffocation?

11:10.090 --> 11:11.387
Her ribs were cracked,

11:11.388 --> 11:14.105
which isn't uncommon
amongst women who tight-lace.

11:14.227 --> 11:16.962
There were no particulates
in the esophagus, meaning

11:16.996 --> 11:19.431
nothing was held over
her mouth. And her airway

11:19.466 --> 11:21.467
did not swell, nor was it blocked.

11:21.501 --> 11:23.969
- Well, then how?
- Given she was standing upright

11:24.003 --> 11:26.805
in a room full of people for
some time before she collapsed,

11:26.839 --> 11:28.774
I simply have no idea.

11:40.252 --> 11:43.955
One hint of discomfort
and this is coming off.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.291
I remember when I was a girl our nanny

11:46.325 --> 11:48.927
forcing Ruby and I to sleep in our corsets.

11:48.961 --> 11:51.596
She tied our arms behind
our backs so we couldn't

11:51.599 --> 11:54.799
- remove them in the night.
- That seems somewhat extreme.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.934
A common practice, actually.

11:56.968 --> 11:59.470
But in our case she was dismissed

11:59.505 --> 12:01.606
and our mother let us run free

12:01.640 --> 12:03.941
probably longer than she should have.

12:03.975 --> 12:06.177
Well, that would explain a thing or two.

12:06.211 --> 12:09.714
Its enormously comfortable.

12:09.748 --> 12:12.382
Nothing horrid poking out anywhere.

12:12.417 --> 12:16.053
I can breathe normally
yet I feel quite supported.

12:16.088 --> 12:19.590
Ah! Remarkable!

12:19.624 --> 12:22.526
It isn't forcing my posture in any way.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.661
And it's oddly fetching.

12:24.696 --> 12:26.863
It is that.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.867
I ordered hot chocolate.

12:36.307 --> 12:39.876
Good evening. Thank you.

12:42.279 --> 12:45.148
Julia!

12:55.325 --> 12:58.494
I couldn't breathe. I couldn't breathe!

12:58.528 --> 13:03.198
William this corset is your killer!

13:06.609 --> 13:07.742
It's a clean break.

13:08.085 --> 13:10.061
Keep it wrapped for six
weeks, then we'll see.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.887
I feel so foolish.

13:12.155 --> 13:14.056
Imagine, a corset squeezing me to death

13:14.090 --> 13:16.758
and my only injury is a broken wrist.

13:18.862 --> 13:23.098
Breathe.

13:23.132 --> 13:25.032
I would never have imagined a corset

13:25.067 --> 13:28.403
could suffocate a woman,
had I not felt it myself.

13:28.437 --> 13:31.373
You're perfectly fine, apart
from the wrist, of course.

13:33.376 --> 13:35.309
Thank you, Emily.

13:35.344 --> 13:37.278
What we women put ourselves through!

13:37.312 --> 13:40.214
Those dress reformers have a point.

13:40.249 --> 13:45.219
When not taken to the extreme,
a corset does serve a purpose.

13:45.254 --> 13:47.821
Yes, but why should we feel the need

13:47.856 --> 13:50.157
to conceal supposed flaws?

13:50.192 --> 13:53.627
Why can't women just wear what they
want and make their own choices?

13:53.661 --> 13:56.030
Not all women are in a position to do so.

13:56.064 --> 13:58.465
You and I still wear a corset every day.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.976
Good morning ladies.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.045
Julia, my goodness what happened to you?

14:12.079 --> 14:15.748
- A corset injury.
- What can we do for you, Lillian?

14:15.783 --> 14:18.551
I've brought the campaign
flyers, hot off the presses.

14:18.585 --> 14:21.054
"Margaret Haile equal rights to all,

14:21.088 --> 14:23.123
special privileges to none."

14:23.157 --> 14:25.425
- What do you think?
- It's excellent.

14:25.459 --> 14:29.695
But Lillian, I must request,
on behalf of the campaign,

14:29.730 --> 14:31.931
that you refrain from
throwing any more bricks.

14:31.965 --> 14:34.834
Julia, in my experience,

14:34.868 --> 14:36.936
action invokes change.

14:36.970 --> 14:40.005
And often that action must
be violent lest it be ignored.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.476
And in my experience, change must
happen within social boundaries,

14:43.510 --> 14:45.611
lest it be dismissed as radical.

14:45.646 --> 14:50.115
Perhaps you should loosen
more than just your corset.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.018
I'm free this afternoon.

14:53.053 --> 14:55.054
I can go canvassing with Lillian.

14:55.088 --> 14:58.490
Lovely.

14:58.524 --> 15:02.394
And I promise to be
proper at least for today.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.602
So it was the corset, then.

15:10.636 --> 15:13.438
- I believe so, sir.
- How?

15:13.473 --> 15:18.443
Corsets are stiff, molded
supports encased in fabric,

15:18.478 --> 15:21.745
designed to force the body
into an artificial shape.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.215
Right, yes.

15:24.249 --> 15:27.218
This corset, however, exhibits

15:27.252 --> 15:30.254
none of those standard traits.

15:30.289 --> 15:32.756
For a married man you seem
know a great deal about corsets,

15:32.791 --> 15:35.360
Murdoch.

15:38.162 --> 15:40.163
What do these bits do, then?

15:40.198 --> 15:43.266
I have no idea.

15:53.378 --> 15:55.312
Sir.

15:55.346 --> 15:58.281
The texts on garment making you requested.

15:58.316 --> 16:00.717
Ah. Thank you, George.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.220
Sir...

16:03.254 --> 16:06.956
Do you think young Bobby
Brackenreid is on the up-and-up?

16:06.991 --> 16:10.359
I have no reason to believe he isn't.

16:10.394 --> 16:13.095
Lying and stealing, sir? That's
not normal for a boy his age.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.765
George. Lying and stealing

16:15.799 --> 16:18.267
is exactly normal for a boy his age.

16:18.301 --> 16:22.104
Having the Inspector as a
father would have its own trials,

16:22.139 --> 16:24.507
I imagine...

16:24.542 --> 16:27.076
George, I believe I have
discovered how this corset

16:27.110 --> 16:30.646
- killed Miss Young.
- Indeed? How, exactly?

16:30.680 --> 16:33.115
You see these pieces of chain link.

16:33.150 --> 16:36.552
When they are fitted together
at exactly this angle,

16:36.586 --> 16:38.620
they create a ratchet

16:38.655 --> 16:40.789
and they cannot be pulled apart.

16:40.823 --> 16:45.126
In fact, the ratchets
will only tighten further.

16:45.161 --> 16:47.563
Sir, what tightened it in the first place?

16:47.597 --> 16:50.599
Well, I don't know yet.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.968
I haven't discovered any
sort of triggering mechanism.

16:53.002 --> 16:54.803
Is there a trigger of some sort?

16:54.837 --> 16:58.173
Well, there must be, I
just haven't found it yet.

17:04.946 --> 17:08.249
Of course I designed it. You're holding
my sketches, bearing my official seal.

17:08.284 --> 17:11.486
- Is this all of them?
- Yes. Charlotte,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.521
you've gained one eighth
of an inch on your waist.

17:13.556 --> 17:15.690
- What have you been eating?
- Nothing, I swear.

17:15.723 --> 17:17.692
None of these sketches show the inner layer

17:17.726 --> 17:20.828
with the horizontal rows of metal keys.

17:20.862 --> 17:23.964
If it's not in the sketches,
it's not in the garment.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.733
Miss Heloise, I believe
you are failing to grasp

17:26.768 --> 17:29.070
the seriousness of this situation.

17:29.104 --> 17:32.372
You have admitted to designing a
corset that has killed a young woman.

17:32.407 --> 17:35.309
Oh, I understand the
seriousness all too well.

17:35.343 --> 17:38.712
I've not had one inquiry about
my products since the incident.

17:38.746 --> 17:41.781
And corsets don't kill.

17:41.816 --> 17:44.851
Well, this one did. It was
built for that very purpose.

17:44.985 --> 17:49.455
Even if what you're saying
is true, why on earth

17:49.490 --> 17:51.625
would I design such a corset when I was set

17:51.659 --> 17:53.793
to model it myself?

17:53.828 --> 17:56.462
- Who was aware of this?
- It was hardly a secret.

17:56.497 --> 17:59.465
I always model in my fashion parades.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.968
Well, Miss Heloise, if that is the case,

18:02.003 --> 18:04.037
if you were set to model the corset

18:04.071 --> 18:06.038
and this was public knowledge,

18:06.072 --> 18:08.508
then you very well could
be the intended target.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.210
So the person who built this corset

18:11.245 --> 18:14.180
not only set out to destroy
my business but me as well?

18:14.214 --> 18:17.383
So it would seem.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.418
I find that hard to believe.

18:19.453 --> 18:22.821
See, I am respected and beloved.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.270
I can assure you no one
is trying to kill me.

18:25.304 --> 18:28.440
Charlotte will see you out.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.516
Don't mind her. She's just like that.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.486
Which is why I think
there are plenty of people

18:41.520 --> 18:43.821
who wouldn't cry over her grave.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.791
Yourself included.

18:46.825 --> 18:50.128
Why did Miss Heloise not model the corset?

18:50.162 --> 18:52.464
She didn't model the corset

18:52.498 --> 18:54.832
because she was too fat to fit into it.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.769
- But did she not make it to measure?
- Miss Heloise

18:57.803 --> 19:01.105
doesn't make anything. She draws
it and Miss Parks builds it.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.607
- Miss Parks?
- Eunice Parks.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.843
The head seamstress.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.379
We use a factory in Buffalo
to produce the orders

19:08.413 --> 19:11.048
as they come in, but
they have yet to receive

19:11.083 --> 19:13.617
this season's patterns.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.787
And what of the corsets from
the evening of the event?

19:16.821 --> 19:19.156
I build the prototypes
for the fashion parades.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.392
Well, then perhaps

19:21.426 --> 19:26.062
you can tell me how these ratchets tighten?

19:26.097 --> 19:29.532
I have no idea what that is.

19:29.566 --> 19:32.869
By your own admission,
you made this corset.

19:32.904 --> 19:35.305
I made a corset.

19:35.339 --> 19:37.540
Similar to this one,

19:37.574 --> 19:39.709
but this is not the corset that I made.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.812
How can you be so sure?

19:41.846 --> 19:43.847
This corset was sewn by a machine.

19:43.881 --> 19:45.848
I don't use machines.

19:45.882 --> 19:48.184
I personally sew each prototype by hand.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.787
Oh... well, then,

19:50.821 --> 19:52.822
where is the corset that you built?

19:52.956 --> 19:56.572
The last I saw it was the
night of the fashion parade.

19:56.624 --> 19:59.479
I haven't the slightest
idea where it is now.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.994
Uh, sir, Jackson and Higgins are
on their way to the House of Heloise

20:09.998 --> 20:13.201
to look for the prototype
of this killer corset.

20:13.235 --> 20:16.404
- Good. What have you, George?
- Well sir, I found out there are several corsetières

20:16.438 --> 20:18.406
in Toronto and they
all use sewing machines.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.509
- Well, we'll need to speak with them all.
- No need to, sir.

20:21.543 --> 20:25.079
I also found out that one of
those corsetières is Gareth Clarke.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.781
George, just because Mr.
Clark's company uses machines

20:27.816 --> 20:29.850
doesn't mean we should
rule out the rest of them.

20:29.884 --> 20:32.920
No, sir. But I also learned that
seamstresses are terrible gossips.

20:32.954 --> 20:36.924
And as it turns out, Mr. Clarke
and Miss Heloise were once involved.

20:36.958 --> 20:40.660
She was one of his best
models until she left Clarke,

20:40.695 --> 20:43.388
opened a corset house of her own, and
brought all his best clients with her.

20:44.115 --> 20:46.383
Well then, bring in Mr. Clarke, George.

20:46.417 --> 20:49.586
Sir, he's in your office.

20:49.620 --> 20:53.556
- Did you collect any samples from his machines?
- All 30, sir.

20:53.591 --> 20:56.559
- They're on my desk.
- Right.

20:56.594 --> 20:59.195
Well then, compare those samples

20:59.229 --> 21:02.198
- to this corset as soon as you can.
- Sir. Right away.

21:02.232 --> 21:04.801
Oh, and George... good work.

21:08.038 --> 21:11.307
Crabtree. This business
between Bobby and Simon

21:11.341 --> 21:14.277
- needs dealing with.
- Sir, I couldn't agree more.

21:14.311 --> 21:16.478
I understand that boys of a certain age,

21:16.513 --> 21:17.905
it's not easy without a man to look up to.

21:18.081 --> 21:20.723
"Without a man to look up... "
Sir, Bobby hit Simon from behind!

21:20.724 --> 21:21.804
It was a dirty blow.

21:22.085 --> 21:26.555
- My boy doesn't fight dirty.
- Sir, no offence, but how do you know?

21:26.589 --> 21:29.158
Because, Crabtree, he's a Brackenreid.

21:29.192 --> 21:31.560
We win by skill and with spunk.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.930
Sir, with all due respect,
Bobby is no match for Simon.

21:34.964 --> 21:37.165
- It's not a fair fight.
- We'll see about that.

21:37.199 --> 21:39.234
I'll get the lads to build a boxing ring.

21:39.268 --> 21:42.404
- A boxing ring?
- A fair fight. The winner takes the penny.

21:42.439 --> 21:46.141
If that's what you want, I'm sure Simon will
be happy to settle this once and for all.

21:46.175 --> 21:48.209
As will Bobby.

21:56.285 --> 21:58.987
We're comparing sewing
samples from your machines

21:59.021 --> 22:01.256
to the corset that killed Isabelle Young.

22:01.290 --> 22:03.958
It's a waste of time. It's
not the machines that differ,

22:03.992 --> 22:06.327
but the women operating
them. And there are legions

22:06.361 --> 22:10.364
of seamstresses in the
city who use machines.

22:10.398 --> 22:12.934
You and Miss Heloise have a history.

22:12.968 --> 22:16.504
And that history gives you the
strongest motive for seeing her dead.

22:16.538 --> 22:18.773
I'm afraid I'm not following you.

22:18.807 --> 22:20.841
You must have known Miss
Heloise was planning to wear

22:20.875 --> 22:23.077
the corset that night.

22:23.111 --> 22:25.079
Heloise was supposed to wear the corset?

22:25.113 --> 22:28.782
Of course. Her vanity knows no bounds.

22:28.816 --> 22:31.151
Did you make that corset
in the hopes of killing

22:31.186 --> 22:33.253
Miss Heloise? I did not.

22:33.288 --> 22:37.657
If I was going to kill Heloise
why would I choose a corset?

22:37.692 --> 22:41.461
As bad for my business as for hers.

22:49.770 --> 22:52.005
I would have expected
the women of the Annex

22:52.039 --> 22:54.007
to be a little more open
to a female candidate.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.275
Middle-class women are more interested

22:56.310 --> 22:59.112
in social climbing than social change.

22:59.146 --> 23:02.015
Lillian, I know what you told Julia,

23:02.049 --> 23:04.417
but why did you throw the brick?

23:08.889 --> 23:14.859
Three years ago, I refused to marry

23:14.894 --> 23:19.998
the eminently presentable suitor
my parents had chosen for me.

23:24.703 --> 23:28.939
But I had to leave
university and find a job.

23:28.973 --> 23:34.178
As a model, as it happened,
at the House of Heloise.

23:34.212 --> 23:38.982
- I see.
- Miss Heloise treats her models like cattle,

23:39.017 --> 23:41.585
and when I protested I was summarily fired.

23:41.619 --> 23:45.923
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.991
If I hadn't been fired, I would have

23:48.026 --> 23:50.260
never dedicated my life to worthy causes.

23:50.294 --> 23:53.430
I would have never have taken off the
medieval torture device known as a corset

23:53.464 --> 23:57.634
and I would have never met you.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.374
Evans, Wesley. Good job, lads.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.878
How are you getting on, Murdoch?

24:08.912 --> 24:11.147
Sir. Very slowly.

24:11.182 --> 24:12.516
Higgins and Jackson were unable to find the

24:12.517 --> 24:14.662
original prototype at the House of Heloise.

24:14.851 --> 24:16.852
You believe that whoever made
the lethal corset swapped it

24:16.887 --> 24:19.388
for the prototype at the
last minute. Find the corset,

24:19.422 --> 24:21.591
- find the killer.
- That was my hope,

24:21.625 --> 24:24.060
but I fear it have been destroyed by now.

24:24.094 --> 24:26.495
- Do you have a suspect in mind?
- Well, sir, now that we know

24:26.529 --> 24:28.764
Miss Heloise was the intended target,

24:28.799 --> 24:32.401
I believe the killer may have not been
present at the time of Miss Young's murder.

24:32.435 --> 24:34.503
If he was there he would have
stopped Miss Young from wearing it.

24:34.537 --> 24:36.838
Precisely.

24:36.872 --> 24:38.840
Although if I wanted to kill
Miss Heloise with a corset

24:38.874 --> 24:40.842
and Miss Young comes out wearing it,

24:40.876 --> 24:42.811
I'd probably keep my mouth shut
or I'll be arrested for murder.

24:42.845 --> 24:45.914
- That's an excellent point.
- Right. I'm gonna keep Bobby

24:45.948 --> 24:49.284
away from Margaret's Yorkshire
pudding. Training starts at dawn.

24:49.319 --> 24:51.419
You should leave, too.

24:51.453 --> 24:53.588
Go do something fun this evening, Murdoch.

24:53.623 --> 24:56.625
Oh, I plan to do exactly that, sir.

24:59.028 --> 25:01.896
The simple act of breathing
may be all that was required

25:01.931 --> 25:05.133
- to activate the mechanism.
- The bellows should be higher.

25:05.167 --> 25:08.002
A corseted woman breathes in
the upper section of her lungs.

25:08.036 --> 25:10.338
The diaphragm has no room to expand.

25:10.372 --> 25:13.341
Hence the "heaving bosom"
of a woman in distress.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.876
Oh... Oh, I see.

25:15.910 --> 25:17.845
That should do it.

25:17.879 --> 25:19.847
Right, then. Let's get started. Dr. Grace,

25:19.881 --> 25:21.849
if I could trouble you to
take measurements of the waist

25:21.883 --> 25:24.484
- and uh, bosom.
- And what should I do?

25:27.455 --> 25:31.058
For heaven's sake. My wrist is
broken, it hasn't fallen off.

25:31.092 --> 25:33.293
Hand me a measuring tape.

25:51.212 --> 25:53.380
Alright then.

25:58.719 --> 26:02.555
Approximately one eighth of
an inch lost in the waist,

26:02.589 --> 26:05.357
and one sixteenth in the ribcage.

26:05.392 --> 26:07.794
Isabelle Young wore the corset
for approximately one hour

26:07.828 --> 26:10.096
before her death. This
could take some time.

26:10.130 --> 26:12.398
An hour? I was barely wearing it 5 minutes

26:12.432 --> 26:14.567
when I felt it tighten significantly.

26:14.601 --> 26:18.404
- What happened in those five minutes?
- You laced me up.

26:18.438 --> 26:20.506
You bent down to touch your toes.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.108
Then you left the room

26:23.142 --> 26:25.911
and all of a sudden I just
couldn't get my breath.

26:25.945 --> 26:28.514
- The cocoa.
- Cocoa?

26:28.548 --> 26:31.616
Room service delivered cocoa.

26:31.650 --> 26:33.719
There was a knock at the door

26:33.753 --> 26:36.021
and a sharp intake of breath...

26:40.326 --> 26:42.393
... and that activated
the mechanism. Dr. Grace,

26:42.428 --> 26:45.030
if I could trouble you for
another measurement, please.

26:45.064 --> 26:47.532
Two full inches less in the waist,

26:47.566 --> 26:50.335
and one and half in the ribcage.

26:50.369 --> 26:53.037
The pressure being exerted is
certainly enough to break ribs.

26:53.071 --> 26:56.040
- As happened to Isabelle Young.
- The knock startled me.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.908
I gasped, and it triggered the mechanism.

26:57.943 --> 26:59.944
Much like a brick being
thrown through a window would.

26:59.978 --> 27:03.313
- I imagine so.
- The brick was the catalyst...

27:03.348 --> 27:06.784
and Lillian Moss threw the brick.

27:06.818 --> 27:09.720
But why? Lillian may have radical ideas,

27:09.755 --> 27:12.389
but to plan such a
devious murder to protest

27:12.423 --> 27:15.226
- the wearing of corsets...
- Detective...

27:15.260 --> 27:19.929
- Dr. Grace?
- Lillian worked for Miss Heloise.

27:19.964 --> 27:21.931
She was fired and has
resented her ever since.

27:21.966 --> 27:24.167
- Emily!
- I only learned of it today.

27:24.201 --> 27:27.203
Eliminate the corsets and
the devil who makes them

27:27.238 --> 27:29.439
in one fell swoop.

27:29.474 --> 27:31.775
Lillian Moss has made fools of us all.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.376
_

27:36.377 --> 27:37.717
Do we have your vote, Detective?

27:39.516 --> 27:42.652
Do you see the similarities, Miss Moss?

27:42.686 --> 27:45.421
The paper stock is identical.

27:45.456 --> 27:48.925
You threw the brick through
Miss Heloise's window.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.960
You wrote the threatening letter,

27:50.994 --> 27:55.130
indicating premeditation, and you
were once in Miss Heloise's employ.

27:55.165 --> 27:58.733
How did you...

27:58.768 --> 28:01.003
I imagine Dr. Grace told you.

28:01.037 --> 28:03.005
You had the ability

28:03.039 --> 28:05.941
to design a corset to kill Miss Heloise.

28:05.976 --> 28:10.879
Detective, I hold no
affection for Miss Heloise.

28:10.913 --> 28:13.381
No one who modelled for her does.

28:13.415 --> 28:15.851
But even if I could design such a corset,

28:15.885 --> 28:17.953
I couldn't make it.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.154
I can't sew to save my life.

28:20.189 --> 28:23.725
I ruined three campaign
banners. Ask your wife.

28:24.859 --> 28:27.228
What did you mean by this letter,

28:27.262 --> 28:30.865
- "corsets kill?"
- They do kill... and maim.

28:34.102 --> 28:36.670
The brick was only meant to disrupt.

28:36.705 --> 28:39.540
You've already lied to me once, Miss Moss.

28:39.574 --> 28:42.510
I swear.

28:42.624 --> 28:46.159
What about any of the other models?

28:46.194 --> 28:48.596
Would they be able to build this corset?

28:48.630 --> 28:52.901
Charlotte Tennant was a seamstress
before she became a model.

28:52.935 --> 28:55.336
Make it full-sized, Burns, full sized.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.372
Sir, respectfully, shouldn't
it be a foot smaller?

28:57.406 --> 28:59.673
- I mean, they're just boys.
- There's no sense in

28:59.708 --> 29:01.709
molly-coddling them, Crabtree.
If they're going to fight

29:01.743 --> 29:04.077
like men, they should
fight in a man-sized ring.

29:04.112 --> 29:08.081
Henry... what's all this?

29:08.116 --> 29:10.150
The boys are going to
have a proper fight sir.

29:10.184 --> 29:13.053
- The boys...
- Simon is the clear favourite.

29:13.087 --> 29:15.255
Bobby doesn't stand a chance.

29:15.290 --> 29:18.658
Uh, don't tell the Inspector
I said that, though.

29:18.692 --> 29:22.195
Sir. I'm going to release Miss Moss.

29:22.230 --> 29:24.731
I no longer believe her to
be involved in the murder.

29:24.765 --> 29:28.168
Also, I'll be returning to the
House of Heloise to question

29:28.202 --> 29:31.003
- the employees further.
- Good, good.

29:31.038 --> 29:33.540
Good...

29:42.316 --> 29:44.383
You really believe me capable of murder?

29:44.418 --> 29:46.346
- No, that's not...
- Even worse, that you could so easily

29:46.347 --> 29:47.347
betray my confidence!

29:47.420 --> 29:51.157
Lillian, I work with the police.
It was pertinent information.

29:51.191 --> 29:54.793
Imagine me, thinking you... you could be...

29:54.828 --> 29:59.332
- Be what?
- My secrets are mine to keep.

29:59.366 --> 30:02.734
This is my job. You have to understand...
- I don't, actually.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.884
Of course Miss Heloise is strict. And mean.

30:18.918 --> 30:22.387
Except to Isabelle. She was the favourite.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.857
She got invited to dinner
with clients and everything.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.861
But I didn't mind. Isabelle was nice.

30:29.895 --> 30:33.331
You started here as a seamstress.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.167
Yes. I was truly terrible at sewing.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.670
I was lucky Miss Heloise fired that
Lillian girl and needed a model right away.

30:39.785 --> 30:43.487
- Did you use a sewing machine?
- Heavens, no.

30:43.521 --> 30:47.157
I could never understand how to
work one of those contraptions.

30:47.192 --> 30:51.495
What about any of the other models?

30:51.594 --> 30:55.631
Nicolette Green only cares
about finding a husband.

30:55.665 --> 30:58.233
Good luck to her she's
hardly a ray of sunshine.

30:58.268 --> 31:00.302
She even works the odd time for Mr. Clarke.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.304
And never mind the champagne

31:02.338 --> 31:04.339
she stole from the fashion parade.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.310
She also works for Mr. Clarke?

31:08.344 --> 31:11.913
It's true I don't care for the way

31:11.947 --> 31:14.049
Miss Heloise treats us,

31:14.083 --> 31:16.217
but this is the best house
in the city, which means

31:16.251 --> 31:18.553
I meet the best clients.

31:18.587 --> 31:22.023
I would never jeopardize my position here.

31:22.058 --> 31:25.226
Then why work for Mr. Clarke?

31:25.260 --> 31:27.895
Beauty costs money, Detective.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.599
And men like their women
beautiful, don't they?

31:31.633 --> 31:35.035
Do you know of anyone that may

31:35.070 --> 31:38.172
have wished Miss Heloise dead?

31:38.207 --> 31:42.243
Mr. Clarke does like to watch her suffer.

31:42.277 --> 31:45.212
I think he was trying
to poach our seamstress.

31:45.246 --> 31:47.447
- Eunice Parks?
- I saw her leaving

31:47.481 --> 31:49.516
Mr. Clarke's office two weeks ago.

31:49.550 --> 31:51.719
Nicolette. Get dressed.

31:51.753 --> 31:54.688
You are accompanying me to dinner
with the buyer from Harrods.

31:54.723 --> 31:57.691
The Detective can see himself out.

31:57.726 --> 31:59.859
That is if he isn't too busy

31:59.893 --> 32:01.928
ogling young girls to solve a murder.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.797
- Miss Heloise...
- I'm sorry,

32:04.832 --> 32:08.901
but this has been a very trying time.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.977
14 to 1?

32:18.011 --> 32:20.512
I wouldn't bet on Bobby at 100 to 1.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.983
25 cents on Simon. 14 to 1!

32:24.017 --> 32:26.252
Can't say I'm surprised. Poor wee Bobby's

32:26.286 --> 32:28.254
going to have his lunch served to him.

32:28.288 --> 32:30.256
Higgins!

32:30.290 --> 32:32.725
Did I just hear you say that the
odds are running against my son?

32:32.759 --> 32:35.261
You know, sir, I'm not sure what

32:35.295 --> 32:37.429
the lads are thinking.

32:37.464 --> 32:40.399
I'm sure they're just
blinded by Simon's height.

32:40.433 --> 32:43.535
Hey, Goliath's height didn't
mean anything to David, did it?

32:46.105 --> 32:48.106
And who did you bet on?

32:48.141 --> 32:50.408
I was just gonna...

32:50.442 --> 32:53.411
- ... lay my money on Bobby.
- Were you now?

32:53.445 --> 32:56.648
- How much?
- 10 cents?

32:58.885 --> 33:01.019
I mean, 25 cents, sir.

33:03.622 --> 33:06.924
- That is... one dollar?
- That sounds about right.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.959
Should I put the kettle on, sir?

33:08.994 --> 33:12.129
Good lad.

33:16.835 --> 33:19.404
Please, come in.

33:19.438 --> 33:22.907
I understand you attempted to
poach Miss Heloise's seamstress.

33:22.941 --> 33:26.743
Miss Parks came to me unsolicited.

33:26.778 --> 33:29.780
- Oh. Why was that?
- She wished

33:29.815 --> 33:32.516
to sell me a design,
a very innovative one...

33:32.550 --> 33:35.052
with the condition that I
hire her as head designer.

33:35.086 --> 33:38.289
- And you declined.
- On the contrary.

33:38.323 --> 33:41.391
I was thrilled. But when
I went to the patent office

33:41.426 --> 33:44.394
to register the designs, I
found them already spoken for.

33:44.429 --> 33:47.997
Miss Parks obviously stole
the designs from Heloise

33:48.032 --> 33:50.166
and tried to pass them off as her own.

33:50.201 --> 33:53.036
I couldn't very well hire her after that.

33:53.070 --> 33:56.206
- I see. You've brought the drawings?
- Yes.

34:00.811 --> 34:03.012
It's all worked out,

34:03.047 --> 34:06.115
since that is the very corset
that killed that lovely model.

34:06.150 --> 34:08.885
I couldn't weather a scandal like that.

34:18.462 --> 34:21.029
Eunice Parks was the
designer of the corset.

34:21.063 --> 34:25.067
Miss Heloise stole the
drawings from her. Henry!

34:25.101 --> 34:28.270
- Sir?
- Arrest Eunice Parks

34:28.304 --> 34:31.539
for the murder of Isabelle Young.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.540
- She's the one?
- I believe so, Sir.

34:38.270 --> 34:41.139
You "believe", so you have no proof, then.

34:41.172 --> 34:43.975
Well, not as of yet. I'm
hoping to find the original

34:44.009 --> 34:46.310
corset that Miss Parks sewed

34:46.344 --> 34:48.511
and compare it to the one
that killed Isabelle Young.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.514
- Hoping to prove that she sewed them both.
- Precisely.

34:51.549 --> 34:54.516
I'll have George search her
boarding house as soon as possible.

34:54.552 --> 34:58.888
Um, Crabtree is
otherwise... occupied today.

34:58.923 --> 35:02.358
- Let me take care of it for you.
- Oh... thank you, sir.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.761
Higgins!

35:07.295 --> 35:10.333
I did not make the corset
that killed Isabelle.

35:10.447 --> 35:13.550
Miss Heloise stole your design,

35:13.584 --> 35:15.685
your revolutionary design,

35:15.719 --> 35:18.120
and you were seeking revenge.

35:18.155 --> 35:21.823
I created it under her roof. It
was her right to assume ownership.

35:21.858 --> 35:25.594
Where is the original prototype?

35:25.628 --> 35:28.492
- I cannot say.
- Constables are searching

35:28.495 --> 35:31.467
your boarding house as we
speak. It will be found.

35:31.501 --> 35:34.970
I assure you, it will not.

35:35.004 --> 35:37.673
I imagine I am free to leave.

35:37.707 --> 35:40.341
Yes, yes, for now.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.913
Oh!

35:47.149 --> 35:49.551
Miss Parks...

35:49.586 --> 35:53.555
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to stay a little longer.

35:57.859 --> 36:00.061
You were right. It was
hidden in the one place

36:00.095 --> 36:03.297
- no man would think to look.
- Thank you, Julia.

36:03.331 --> 36:06.500
I'm hoping to prove that she
sewed the killer corset as well.

36:06.534 --> 36:10.471
Perhaps your eye for fashion
will see something that I can't.

36:13.941 --> 36:15.942
Well, the corset Miss Parks was wearing

36:15.977 --> 36:18.678
is of exceptional quality.

36:18.713 --> 36:21.715
It was most certainly sewn by hand.

36:21.749 --> 36:24.751
That would fit her story.

36:26.954 --> 36:30.590
Whereas the stitching on the
corset that killed Miss Young

36:30.625 --> 36:33.259
lacks the same artistry.

36:33.293 --> 36:35.261
I'm sorry, William, but I see no indication

36:35.295 --> 36:37.263
that they were sewn by the same hand.

36:37.297 --> 36:41.635
Perhaps they weren't sewn
by the same hand at all.

36:52.446 --> 36:54.647
I fail to see the point of this.

36:57.518 --> 36:59.685
This aberration in the stitch is the same

36:59.719 --> 37:03.588
as that of the corset that
suffocated Isabelle Young.

37:03.623 --> 37:06.058
You interrupt the flow of the
pedal at the same interval.

37:06.092 --> 37:08.127
Eunice Parks.

37:08.161 --> 37:10.963
You built a murderous
device with intent to kill.

37:10.997 --> 37:14.099
I am charging you with the
murder of Isabelle Young.

37:17.870 --> 37:21.173
I never meant for Isabelle to die.

37:21.207 --> 37:23.308
I didn't know she was wearing the corset.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.443
I was sent out to buy more champagne.

37:25.478 --> 37:29.781
I still don't know why Miss
Heloise wasn't modelling it.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.551
It was custom-made for her.

37:32.585 --> 37:36.721
It fit her like a glove
just the day before.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.956
She didn't model the corset

37:38.991 --> 37:42.293
because she was too fat to fit into it.

37:43.897 --> 37:46.167
Good day, Miss Tennant.

37:46.201 --> 37:48.569
I wonder...

37:48.603 --> 37:51.839
Do you recall exactly why Miss Heloise

37:51.873 --> 37:54.074
chose not to model that corset?

37:54.108 --> 37:56.276
Of course I remember.

37:56.310 --> 37:58.412
Nicolette tried her best
but she just couldn't squeeze

37:58.446 --> 38:01.081
Miss Heloise into it. It was rather comic.

38:01.115 --> 38:03.650
- And what happened then?
- I volunteered

38:03.685 --> 38:05.652
to wear it but no, it had
to be Isabelle, as always.

38:05.687 --> 38:09.155
- You volunteered?
- Of course.

38:09.190 --> 38:12.792
- I was the only one who never got to wear it.
- How do you mean?

38:12.826 --> 38:16.462
Nicolette tried it on the
day before the fashion parade,

38:16.497 --> 38:18.498
but I never got my turn
because Miss Parks came in

38:18.532 --> 38:21.501
all of a sudden and barked at
Nicolette to take it off right away.

38:21.535 --> 38:23.503
I don't know what all the fuss was about.

38:23.537 --> 38:27.039
Tighter, Charlotte. Tighter.

38:29.410 --> 38:32.745
What are you doing? Take it off.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.747
This is for Miss Heloise

38:34.782 --> 38:37.817
to wear and she alone.

38:37.851 --> 38:42.521
You knew the corset would
suffocate whomever was to wear it.

38:42.555 --> 38:46.558
You offered to help Miss Heloise put it on,

38:46.592 --> 38:48.727
pretended that it was too small
for her, knowing that Miss Young

38:48.761 --> 38:51.297
would be selected to wear it in her place.

38:51.331 --> 38:55.467
You sent Miss Parks out for more champagne,

38:55.501 --> 38:59.070
ensuring that she wouldn't
be there to foil your plan.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.039
You intended to trigger
the mechanism yourself,

39:01.073 --> 39:03.041
but the brick beat you to it.

39:03.075 --> 39:06.344
Detective, the last thing I would want

39:06.378 --> 39:08.814
is to harm the reputation
of the House of Heloise.

39:08.848 --> 39:13.117
No, just relieve Miss Young of her position

39:13.152 --> 39:15.553
so that you could become top model.

39:15.587 --> 39:19.523
Well, I can't deny that has happened.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.926
You murdered an innocent young woman

39:21.961 --> 39:24.929
for free dinners and
the company of gentlemen?

39:24.964 --> 39:27.465
I didn't throw the brick, Detective.

39:27.499 --> 39:32.069
I didn't make the corset. I
didn't even lace it on Isabelle.

39:32.103 --> 39:36.073
No. You just manipulated events

39:36.107 --> 39:40.277
to be sure that Miss Young would
be the one wearing the corset.

39:40.311 --> 39:43.413
I played a prank on a vain woman.

39:44.448 --> 39:47.517
I hardly think that to
be a hanging offence.

39:51.882 --> 39:54.300
Bobby's smaller than Simon. That
needs to be addressed in the rules.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.885
Then sir, what would you
have? Should Simon fight

39:56.919 --> 39:58.854
the whole thing with one
arm tied behind his back?

39:58.888 --> 40:00.889
- That's a start.
- Sir, you can't be serious.

40:00.923 --> 40:04.658
Well, obviously not the whole fight, but the
first round. It's to be a fair fight, remember?

40:04.693 --> 40:06.827
Sir, if that's is the way it's
going to be Simon won't fight.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.796
- Isn't that right, Simon?
- Well, Bobby won't fight

40:08.830 --> 40:10.831
if he's already lost before
he starts, will you, Bobby?

40:15.704 --> 40:18.506
Crabtree... Lads.

40:18.540 --> 40:22.109
Boys. Here's a penny each.

40:22.143 --> 40:24.778
- Get yourselves an ice cream.
- Thank you.

40:24.813 --> 40:28.015
- What do you say, Simon.
- Thanks.

40:28.049 --> 40:30.450
Off ya go, lads.

40:30.485 --> 40:33.654
Why don't you and I have a go, Crabtree.

40:33.868 --> 40:37.268
Oh, sir, I couldn't.
I've got tennis elbow...

40:37.403 --> 40:40.403
- You don't play tennis.
- Technically it was a football injury, sir, but...

40:40.415 --> 40:41.535
You don't play football either.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.773
Sir, I was hit with a hockey puck

40:43.808 --> 40:47.844
in the elbow, as a
child. It's never fully...

40:47.928 --> 40:50.830
It's a pity Eunice Parks

40:50.865 --> 40:53.732
will never see her talents recognized.

40:53.767 --> 40:56.102
And what will happen to Nicolette Green?

40:56.136 --> 40:58.104
A jury will likely see a pretty young woman

40:58.138 --> 41:00.106
and not the devil inside.

41:00.140 --> 41:02.141
She may likely get away with it.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.051
_

41:05.078 --> 41:06.946
Oh... That's a pity.

41:06.980 --> 41:09.014
That corset was quite innovative.

41:09.048 --> 41:11.983
I would have bought one myself,

41:12.018 --> 41:14.185
minus the murderous mechanism, of course.

41:14.276 --> 41:17.579
I find it difficult to
feel sorry for Miss Heloise.

41:17.613 --> 41:20.815
She really is a most unpleasant woman.

41:20.850 --> 41:23.918
William. It's not an easy feat to
rise to the top of one's profession.

41:23.953 --> 41:26.354
- But you did... with grace.
- Yes,

41:26.388 --> 41:29.390
but not all women are
afforded the same advantages.

41:29.424 --> 41:31.525
When a woman like Miss Heloise

41:31.559 --> 41:35.496
fights her way up the ladder, she must
keep fighting lest she lose everything.

41:35.530 --> 41:39.967
Oh, I don't think she's
lost quite everything.

41:40.002 --> 41:43.470
Rumour has it that she and Mr.
Clarke have reignited their romance.

41:43.505 --> 41:45.672
"Rumour has it"?

41:45.707 --> 41:48.542
Seamstresses can be such gossips.

42:00.621 --> 42:03.789
- Lillian...
- I can see how it looked.

42:03.824 --> 42:06.359
I don't blame you for doubting me.

42:06.394 --> 42:10.463
- I understand why you did what you did.
- I'm glad to hear it.

42:10.498 --> 42:14.000
But you must understand, Emily, my
suffragist sisters are all I have.

42:14.035 --> 42:16.135
I do understand.

42:16.169 --> 42:20.506
It just... sometimes the way you behave...

42:20.541 --> 42:22.575
You frighten me.

42:22.609 --> 42:26.879
- I frighten you?
- You will do anything

42:26.914 --> 42:31.050
- for the cause.
- Not just for the cause.

42:31.084 --> 42:35.654
- I... I doubt I have your passion.
- You do.

42:35.688 --> 42:39.323
- You lead by example.
- It doesn't feel like enough.

42:39.358 --> 42:42.460
Then do more. Lead by action instead.

42:45.330 --> 42:48.766
I... want to go corset-free.

42:49.500 --> 42:53.271
Now, that I can help you with.
