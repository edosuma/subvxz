<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty:

00:01.293 --> 00:04.842
- Your father offered me the COO position.
- That was supposed to be mine.

00:04.925 --> 00:07.553
With Jeff's backing,
I will be your competition.

00:07.636 --> 00:10.556
- This is my boyfriend.
- Did you see Robby Reid?

00:10.639 --> 00:12.433
- He said he met your boyfriend.
- No.

00:12.516 --> 00:14.185
I told him that
so he'd get off my back.

00:14.268 --> 00:16.187
Kori, this is Michael Culhane.

00:18.814 --> 00:20.691
Who set up tonight's robbery?

00:20.774 --> 00:23.736
I did this to help you
and it's your fault?

00:23.819 --> 00:25.362
- I'm sorry.
- I don't accept that.

00:25.446 --> 00:27.323
We would like to pay
for Matthew's funeral.

00:27.406 --> 00:29.408
We just don't want you
to worry about anything.

00:29.492 --> 00:31.452
Cristal Carrington's sex tape?
Is that real?

00:31.535 --> 00:34.330
- Oh, it's real.
- You and Matt on the Internet.

00:34.413 --> 00:37.625
- Oh, my God.
- Claudia? Has anyone spoken to her?

01:43.732 --> 01:46.652
Mr. Carrington wanted you to have this,
with his compliments.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.488
Where is he?

01:49.572 --> 01:51.699
He said he'd meet you
at the office.

01:51.782 --> 01:54.159
His way of saying, "Don't be late."

01:56.370 --> 01:57.204
Jeanette?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.052
Where are you off to, Cristal? Church?

02:13.012 --> 02:15.431
Lord knows,
you love to get down on your knees.

02:15.514 --> 02:18.350
Actually, Fallon, I'm headed
to the same place you are. Work.

02:18.434 --> 02:21.145
Well, not the same place,
'cause I'm heading in

02:21.228 --> 02:23.480
for my first day as COO
of Carrington Atlantic,

02:23.564 --> 02:26.233
and you're...
Do you even have an office yet?

02:26.317 --> 02:27.484
Ballsy, showing your face

02:27.568 --> 02:30.654
while your sex tape with Matthew
is still blowing up on YouTube.

02:30.738 --> 02:32.698
We both know
most of the hits are from you.

02:32.781 --> 02:36.160
But I wanna thank you for your kind words
to the paparazzi on my behalf.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.413
Please, I barely said anything.
I figured with your background in PR,

02:39.496 --> 02:41.582
you could handle your affair
all on your own.

02:41.665 --> 02:44.418
- As deftly as you handled Matthew's hard...
- Excuse me.

02:44.501 --> 02:48.088
I didn't know that tape still existed,
but I owned up to my part in it.

02:48.172 --> 02:50.758
Blake and I agreed
it's best that I put out a statement,

02:50.841 --> 02:52.593
and now it's time to move on.

02:54.762 --> 02:57.806
Adorable.
You think that scandal is going away?

02:57.890 --> 02:59.516
Not until Melania files for divorce

02:59.600 --> 03:01.602
or a Kardashian gets pregnant
with triplets.

03:01.685 --> 03:03.937
At least I have some permanence
in my life.

03:04.021 --> 03:05.939
How is your little company going?

03:06.023 --> 03:08.525
More wind-down than start-up, I hear.

03:08.609 --> 03:11.362
Must be hard not having the global reach
of Carrington Atlantic.

03:11.445 --> 03:13.197
Or any reach at all.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.116
Are you still looking
for that first client?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.245
- What are you doing?
- Good morning, Mrs. Carrington.

03:20.329 --> 03:22.790
Uh, no. Culhane drives me to work.

03:23.624 --> 03:25.167
Oh, is that true, Culhane?

03:25.250 --> 03:27.252
Not today.
I'll be driving Mrs. Carrington.

03:41.892 --> 03:45.312
- Someone's looking sharp.
- I start at the foundation today.

03:45.396 --> 03:48.023
Right.
Boy gets exonerated of murder charges,

03:48.107 --> 03:50.150
boy runs
his father's billion-dollar charity

03:50.234 --> 03:53.112
to help rebuild his image.
Classic American story.

03:54.279 --> 03:57.908
I've apologized a hundred times
for the robbery thing, Steven.

03:57.991 --> 04:00.160
I feel terrible.
What else do you want me to do?

04:00.244 --> 04:02.413
Nothing. That's your specialty
around here, isn't it?

04:02.496 --> 04:06.291
- You're being a little harsh.
- You want harsh?

04:06.917 --> 04:08.627
Ever since you rolled in here,

04:08.711 --> 04:11.046
my family has given you the world,
and you took it.

04:11.130 --> 04:14.883
But that wasn't enough for you,
so, you stole from us, lied to me.

04:14.967 --> 04:18.512
You're so myopic, you don't even see
the hell your actions have set in motion.

04:18.595 --> 04:22.558
- My friend got arrested, not yours.
- I'm not talking about your fr...

04:23.142 --> 04:24.643
You know what? Forget it.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.856
Come on, I am sorry.
Cristal and Blake already forgave me.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.359
That's their mistake.
I'm not making the same one.

04:36.488 --> 04:39.575
Sorry I'm late.
Some douche in a Caddy cut me off.

04:39.658 --> 04:42.494
You drove yourself here?
Glad I wasn't on the road.

04:42.578 --> 04:45.372
- Don't start. I've had a morning.
- I got good news for you.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.125
Guess who made the list
of <i>Atlanta Digest's</i>

04:48.208 --> 04:50.586
upcoming
Top Women in Business issue.

04:50.669 --> 04:53.088
- What?
- The PR guy sent me the list.

04:53.172 --> 04:56.967
- Congratulations, partner.
- But how? I didn't even submit myself.

04:58.010 --> 05:01.930
- You did this for me?
- For us. Could be great PR.

05:02.014 --> 05:04.433
I figured after I lost us
the Atlanta utility contract...

05:04.516 --> 05:06.977
Losing a billion-dollar client
was punishment enough.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.688
Besides, you deserve to be recognized.

05:10.981 --> 05:14.318
I've been trying
to get on this list for three years.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.905
And if you land Woman of the Year,
you get the cover.

05:18.363 --> 05:20.824
Businessmen
at every newsstand will thank me.

05:20.908 --> 05:23.452
You're right.
This exposure could help us land clients

05:23.535 --> 05:25.537
and expand into something legit.

05:26.288 --> 05:28.916
- As you said, we're in this together.
- Right.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.085
Now you just have
to beat out your stepmother.

05:34.713 --> 05:36.381
Are you kidding me?

05:36.465 --> 05:39.092
Cristal "Check Out My Crotch" Carrington
made the list?

05:39.176 --> 05:42.179
I'm sure she was submitted
before the deadline.

05:42.262 --> 05:45.015
That sex tape just hit the Web
a few days ago.

05:45.098 --> 05:47.809
Don't worry.
You got a leg up on her this time.

05:47.893 --> 05:51.396
She's the one with her legs up.
That's why I'm gonna win.

05:53.232 --> 05:55.609
Today begins a new era
at Carrington Atlantic.

05:55.692 --> 05:59.655
Cristal will be transitioning
into her new role as COO starting today.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.952
I'm sure you'll all give her
your complete support.

06:05.619 --> 06:09.581
Of course. Congratulations, Cristal.
Well deserved indeed.

06:09.665 --> 06:12.459
Thank you, Deirdre.
Appreciate your kind words.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.754
Kylie,
I think a press release is in order?

06:15.837 --> 06:19.633
Uh, yes, Mr. Carrington.
I will get that out right away.

06:19.716 --> 06:21.510
Be sure to add something about Cristal

06:21.593 --> 06:23.887
making
Atlanta's Top Women in Business list.

06:23.971 --> 06:25.931
The magazine will host a luncheon tomorrow

06:26.014 --> 06:27.391
to announce Woman of the Year.

06:27.474 --> 06:31.853
It's an honor to be nominated,
but the biggest honor is my new role here,

06:31.937 --> 06:35.566
and I look forward
to working closely with each of you.

06:35.941 --> 06:40.237
- That went as well as I could've hoped.
- We knew today was gonna be tough.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.448
But you held your head high
and you acted like a pro.

06:43.532 --> 06:47.869
I wanna put this scandal behind me.
If I can't prove I'm worthy of this job,

06:47.953 --> 06:51.331
- I can't be effective.
- I'm sure that was the worst of it.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.628
- Claudia.
- Blake, Cristal.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.966
- What are you doing here?
- Picking up Matthew's death benefit.

07:01.049 --> 07:03.677
I imagine
Willy's family will come by for his.

07:03.760 --> 07:08.140
It's a tacky term, since the only one
benefitting from their deaths is you.

07:08.432 --> 07:11.018
We were upset to hear about Willy.

07:11.101 --> 07:13.812
But at least it brought you some closure,
considering his confession.

07:13.896 --> 07:17.149
Please.
Willy did not kill Matthew.

07:17.232 --> 07:20.569
You're the common denominator
in both of these tragedies.

07:21.695 --> 07:25.198
- Cristal, you're quiet. I wonder why.
- How are you feeling?

07:25.282 --> 07:28.118
Don't patronize me.
You didn't seem to care about my feelings

07:28.201 --> 07:31.288
when you taped yourself
screwing my husband.

07:31.371 --> 07:33.832
- We should go.
- I'm so sorry, Claudia.

07:33.916 --> 07:37.628
- I wish you the best.
- You don't wanna know what I wish for you.

07:38.211 --> 07:41.131
- You ruined our lives. Hear me?
- We're done here.

07:41.214 --> 07:44.176
Yes, get back to work, you company tramp.

07:44.259 --> 07:47.054
Or is it company slut?
Which do you prefer?

07:47.137 --> 07:49.222
You may have married into money,

07:49.306 --> 07:52.517
but you are still nothing more
than a well-paid whore.

08:02.931 --> 08:07.931
Subtitles by explosiveskull

08:09.469 --> 08:14.391
Gustav, those fingers are magical.
Don't be afraid to go deeper.

08:14.474 --> 08:16.184
- My pleasure.
- Can I help you?

08:16.267 --> 08:17.477
"May I help you?"

08:17.560 --> 08:20.438
And it seems
you're quite busy helping yourself.

08:23.108 --> 08:25.568
- Be a doll and go get more lube.
- Sure.

08:27.946 --> 08:30.615
- What do you want, Alfred?
- Anders.

08:31.950 --> 08:35.370
Joseph, if we were on a first-name basis,
which we're not.

08:35.453 --> 08:37.664
Joseph? Like half of my name.

08:37.996 --> 08:39.791
We're Jo and Joe.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.587
I take it you
and Steven are no longer having relations?

08:45.630 --> 08:46.923
Hit the seven-day itch?

08:47.006 --> 08:49.259
Just because two gay guys live
in the same house,

08:49.342 --> 08:50.844
you assume we're having sex?

08:50.927 --> 08:54.013
The housekeeper reported
that your bed linen remained unmussed

08:54.097 --> 08:56.558
for the first several days of your stay.

08:56.641 --> 09:00.019
Steven's, on the other hand,
were quite mussed.

09:00.854 --> 09:02.063
What's your point?

09:02.147 --> 09:04.733
You helped engineer a robbery
in this home.

09:04.816 --> 09:08.027
Now that you no longer have the protection
of Steven's caring arms,

09:08.111 --> 09:11.656
I would've thought you
might've changed your leisurely ways.

09:19.622 --> 09:20.749
Kylie, come in.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.625
I need your help.

09:23.293 --> 09:26.171
I know when I headed PR,
you handled print media.

09:26.546 --> 09:28.673
Uh, yeah, yeah, still do.

09:28.757 --> 09:31.801
My interview and photo shoot
for <i>Atlanta Digest</i> is this afternoon,

09:31.885 --> 09:34.387
and I've been reading over
their potential questions.

09:34.471 --> 09:37.390
I'm sure they're gonna ask
about my personal life.

09:37.474 --> 09:40.185
I just wanna sound thoughtful
yet personable.

09:40.268 --> 09:42.604
I wouldn't worry about it so much.

09:42.687 --> 09:46.691
They only publish answers for the person
who lands Woman of the Year.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.862
Right. Well, I don't expect that.

09:52.238 --> 09:54.949
- Of course, it would be nice.
- Of course,

09:55.033 --> 09:57.911
but, um, you know, maybe this year...

10:02.499 --> 10:05.460
There's been a lot
of whispering behind my back.

10:09.631 --> 10:14.093
Why don't you tell me how you really feel?
Go ahead. Free pass.

10:16.262 --> 10:17.096
Okay.

10:19.390 --> 10:21.643
Who you bang, that's your business.

10:22.227 --> 10:25.688
But you know the conversations happening
about women in the workplace.

10:25.772 --> 10:28.316
We can't get mentors,
because guys like Mike Pence

10:28.399 --> 10:32.821
are too afraid to have dinner with us,
so, when you sleep with the boss,

10:32.904 --> 10:35.865
and when your wedding ring comes
with a promotion,

10:35.949 --> 10:37.617
it feels like you proved them right.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.661
This job was offered to me
before any ring.

10:39.744 --> 10:42.580
That's not what people are talking about,
is it?

10:42.664 --> 10:46.376
They're talking about your ass.
That makes it harder for us all.

10:46.459 --> 10:49.879
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but if Fallon got the job,

10:50.672 --> 10:53.341
no one would've accused her
of sleeping her way there.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.802
- You're down with nepotism?
- Not at all.

10:56.344 --> 10:59.055
But at least
that only reflects badly on Blake.

11:00.014 --> 11:01.599
Not an entire gender.

11:04.769 --> 11:06.604
Thank you for your honesty.

11:14.821 --> 11:17.240
Thanks for coming.
We'll be in touch about the grant.

11:18.825 --> 11:20.201
Your next appointment is here,

11:20.285 --> 11:22.620
- from the Sky Conservancy organization.
- I'm ready.

11:26.124 --> 11:27.959
- Mr. Carrington...
- Ted Dinard.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.962
- Hi. I didn't know that...
- We're good, Garrett.

11:31.045 --> 11:34.424
I thought that you left the company
a while ago.

11:34.507 --> 11:37.427
- I'm a, uh, recent rehire.
- Lucky me.

11:38.511 --> 11:41.097
- You have a proposal for us?
- Yeah, great.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.725
Uh... I work with Sky Conservancy
in New York.

11:43.808 --> 11:47.186
You're offering grants to organizations
trying to improve air quality?

11:47.270 --> 11:49.606
- We are.
- Our goal is to work directly

11:49.689 --> 11:52.525
with companies
still operating coal-fueled plants

11:52.609 --> 11:54.944
in an effort to reduce emissions.

11:55.028 --> 11:58.531
This looks a very detailed proposal.
I'll review it later.

11:58.615 --> 12:01.117
But I'm, um,
late for another meeting right now.

12:02.076 --> 12:05.496
- I thought I was your meeting.
- Ah, my assistant double-booked.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.748
I understand.

12:10.877 --> 12:13.046
It was nice seeing you, Steven.

12:22.555 --> 12:23.681
A moment, Blake?

12:24.140 --> 12:27.101
Only one, Deirdre. I've got a call
with our Daqing field office.

12:27.185 --> 12:28.978
I'm concerned about Cristal.

12:31.731 --> 12:32.899
She's green, Blake.

12:33.316 --> 12:35.943
Sure, she's filled with energy and spirit,

12:36.027 --> 12:38.696
but are you certain she's ready
for the position?

12:38.780 --> 12:40.907
Of course. That's why I promoted her.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.494
Unfortunately,
our clients aren't as confident as you.

12:45.912 --> 12:47.288
The Talbertson Group.

12:47.372 --> 12:50.291
Our oil fields provide their refineries
with a steady supply.

12:50.375 --> 12:53.127
Sales exceeded 100 million last year.

12:54.087 --> 12:58.049
- They're concerned about your judgment.
- How concerned are they?

12:58.132 --> 13:02.428
They're threatening to pull their account.
They're based in Katy, Texas.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.263
It's a conservative region.

13:04.847 --> 13:09.268
Cristal's... personal life
may have played a role in their decision.

13:10.812 --> 13:13.606
- What are you suggesting we do?
- If it helps,

13:14.273 --> 13:18.569
I'm happy to step in as interim COO,
until things settle down for Cristal.

13:19.529 --> 13:22.699
I realize this puts you
in an uncomfortable position.

13:23.908 --> 13:26.703
But just think about it.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.586
Beautiful.
Looking great, Fallon.

13:36.254 --> 13:38.005
Oh, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

13:43.010 --> 13:45.763
One of those should make a great cover,
don't you agree, Cristal?

13:45.847 --> 13:48.683
Mm... Stilettos are a little much,
don't you think?

13:48.766 --> 13:51.227
I mean, this isn't <i>Vogue.</i>
This is about women in business.

13:51.310 --> 13:56.357
Oh. I just figured since you were here,
this must be <i>Penthouse.</i> My bad.

13:56.941 --> 13:58.860
You don't have a chance at this.

13:58.943 --> 14:02.530
- Any one of us could end up on the cover.
- Anyone but you.

14:02.613 --> 14:04.991
They won't showcase a woman
whose sexual promiscuity

14:05.074 --> 14:09.037
sets the rest of us back a decade.
They're trying to sell magazines.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.581
If you were a real businesswoman,
you'd know that.

14:12.331 --> 14:14.167
You might have a point, Fallon.

14:17.670 --> 14:20.506
- Diana?
- Oh, Cristal, dear. Have you had a chance

14:20.590 --> 14:23.342
- to sit for your interview?
- I just finished.

14:23.426 --> 14:25.386
I wanted to tell you how flattered I am

14:25.470 --> 14:28.181
to be included
among so many powerful women.

14:28.264 --> 14:30.058
It is an important issue.

14:30.141 --> 14:33.352
Yes, and you know
what would be even more amazing

14:33.436 --> 14:36.981
than having one powerful woman
on the cover? Ten.

14:37.565 --> 14:39.484
I hear you, but it's a tradition.

14:39.567 --> 14:42.528
We've been doing this
since we first ran in 1968.

14:42.612 --> 14:46.324
Right. With men.
You've featured women the last nine years.

14:46.407 --> 14:50.119
So, maybe this anniversary issue
could be time for a change.

14:50.203 --> 14:53.581
Plus, I headed PR
at a Fortune 500 company for years.

14:54.165 --> 14:57.627
Doing a big cover spread
featuring multiple influencers

14:57.710 --> 14:59.462
tends to sell more magazines.

15:01.297 --> 15:05.593
- And that's the name of the game, right?
- I like it, and I like you.

15:05.676 --> 15:08.596
It takes guts to stand tall
in the face of adversity.

15:08.679 --> 15:11.182
Ladies,
can I have you all gather together?

15:11.265 --> 15:14.393
We're going to do something different
this year.

15:14.477 --> 15:16.604
We're going to try a group photo.

15:22.693 --> 15:25.363
Mm, oh. Uh, Fallon, just...

15:25.988 --> 15:27.156
Just...

15:27.990 --> 15:28.825
Yeah.

15:28.908 --> 15:32.662
Those shoes give you a bit of height.
Best you move to the back.

15:32.745 --> 15:37.208
We wanna see everyone's faces.
Cristal, why don't you come forward?

15:37.291 --> 15:40.586
- Let's see how that works.
- Oh. Whatever you think's best.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.338
I think you spoke too soon.

15:42.755 --> 15:45.925
Looks like we both have a shot
at Woman of the Year.

15:46.008 --> 15:47.969
Oh. Let's break those colors up.

15:49.137 --> 15:50.012
Fallon.

15:51.139 --> 15:52.265
Yeah.

15:53.307 --> 15:56.310
Just move to the end. To the end.
Yes, there you go.

15:56.394 --> 15:58.521
Okay. I need everyone to squeeze in.

15:59.730 --> 16:02.441
And one, two.

16:09.742 --> 16:13.704
Steven. Ted Dinard is here to see you.
Last time I saw him,

16:13.787 --> 16:16.540
I assumed it would be the last time
I saw him.

16:19.251 --> 16:22.546
I need to talk to you.
Office didn't feel like the right place.

16:22.629 --> 16:25.883
I've said I'll review your proposal.
I have nothing else to discuss.

16:25.966 --> 16:29.386
I can't go back to New York
until I say what I'm gonna say.

16:30.137 --> 16:32.473
- Two minutes?
- I don't have two minutes.

16:32.556 --> 16:37.394
I know I screwed up in the past,
but believe me, Steven, I get it.

16:38.771 --> 16:41.190
You don't trust me, but I've changed.

16:42.441 --> 16:45.069
That's the same song you used to sing me.

16:45.944 --> 16:49.031
I didn't wanna contact you
until I'd been clean for two years.

16:50.449 --> 16:55.329
So, this is what 736 continuous days
of sobriety looks like.

16:56.789 --> 17:00.834
Not a day has passed
that I haven't thought of you, or us,

17:00.918 --> 17:04.046
and I am just so, so sorry.

17:05.464 --> 17:09.510
My dad told me everything.
That he offered you a quick payoff

17:09.593 --> 17:12.387
to go away, and you took it.
What kind of person does that?

17:12.471 --> 17:15.682
What kind of man offers an addict
that kind of money?

17:15.766 --> 17:18.519
If I was in my right mind,
I never would've taken it.

17:19.103 --> 17:21.230
It's my single biggest regret.

17:21.980 --> 17:25.358
I am just so happy
that I didn't bring you down with me.

17:25.983 --> 17:29.154
So, with all your sobriety,
you still lied to me.

17:29.947 --> 17:34.076
- Your visit had nothing to do with grants.
- No, we need the money for new hires.

17:34.660 --> 17:37.871
But I did know
that you were getting a promotion...

17:39.373 --> 17:42.668
and I was looking for an excuse
to see you.

17:44.336 --> 17:47.506
I'm finally in a really good place
in my life.

17:47.923 --> 17:51.760
- I'm on decent terms with my father...
- I don't wanna mess that up.

17:51.844 --> 17:54.263
I'm happy for you. I really am.

17:57.975 --> 18:00.936
I'm at the Saint James, if you wanna talk.

18:12.322 --> 18:14.408
Diana is so inspiring.

18:14.491 --> 18:18.245
She's a strong female leader,
but she's open to collaboration.

18:18.328 --> 18:20.372
A great afternoon,
wouldn't you say, Fallon?

18:20.455 --> 18:22.875
It's hard to believe
it topped your morning.

18:22.958 --> 18:26.753
Word on the street is Claudia Blaisdel
stopped by for a rant-and-rave session.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.923
- That's none of your concern.
- I didn't say I was concerned.

18:31.133 --> 18:35.137
Well, everything in moderation,
especially family bonding.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.597
I have work to do.

18:38.307 --> 18:41.643
Steven, you're quiet.
How was your first day at the foundation?

18:45.355 --> 18:46.190
What?

18:46.273 --> 18:48.692
Oh, I'm sorry. It went well. Yeah.

18:49.526 --> 18:52.821
- I have a lot on my mind.
- Like the Saint James Hotel?

18:57.492 --> 19:01.038
I have proposals to review,
so, I should get back to it.

19:02.206 --> 19:04.416
Does anyone know what's for dessert?

19:05.918 --> 19:08.503
You two kids probably wanna dine alone.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.885
How old is he again?

19:16.220 --> 19:18.805
Fallon shouldn't have said anything
about Claudia.

19:18.889 --> 19:21.516
She didn't say anything
I haven't already said to myself.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.270
I've been thinking a lot
about this morning.

19:25.354 --> 19:27.731
Claudia has every right
to be upset with me.

19:27.814 --> 19:30.943
- I lied to her.
- She's not well, Cristal.

19:31.777 --> 19:33.946
Considering her condition
and erratic behavior,

19:34.029 --> 19:36.573
I've asked for more security
at the office.

19:38.283 --> 19:41.870
It might not be a bad idea for you
to take a step back out of the public eye

19:41.954 --> 19:43.163
until things settle.

19:43.622 --> 19:47.542
It's hard to take a step back
when you're COO of a major company.

19:47.793 --> 19:50.504
You should take a step back from that,
as well.

19:50.671 --> 19:52.714
We'll get PR to rebuild your image,

19:52.798 --> 19:55.509
and then you can resume your role
with less distraction.

19:55.592 --> 19:58.887
- So, now you're losing faith in me, too?
- Of course not.

19:59.388 --> 20:03.016
It's just the kind of business we're in,
optics are important.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.354
I see. Well, I'm sorry
I'm not keeping up appearances for you.

20:14.903 --> 20:17.531
There you are.
I've been texting you nonstop

20:17.614 --> 20:18.824
for like 20 minutes.

20:18.907 --> 20:20.242
I'm off the clock.

20:20.325 --> 20:23.412
I'm late for a meeting and I lost my keys.
I need the spare set.

20:23.495 --> 20:26.665
- It's in the bowl over there, silver tag.
- That's it?

20:28.125 --> 20:30.752
- Want me to start the car for you?
- Have anything to say?

20:30.836 --> 20:32.838
- Like an apology, maybe?
- For what?

20:32.921 --> 20:35.590
For sleeping with the enemy.
Kori Rucks screwed me

20:35.674 --> 20:39.011
- out of a billion-dollar contract.
- If you want me to apologize for Kori,

20:39.094 --> 20:41.680
you'll be waiting for a long time.
As a matter of fact,

20:41.763 --> 20:43.849
you owe me an apology
for a lot of things.

20:43.932 --> 20:46.977
We can start with that game
you played at the club.

20:47.060 --> 20:49.187
- Excuse me?
- You told that Ivy League douche

20:49.271 --> 20:51.898
- I was your boyfriend.
- But I just said that...

20:51.982 --> 20:54.901
To get away from that douche. I know.

20:54.985 --> 20:58.405
- I heard you tell Monica.
- Is that why you slept with Kori,

20:58.488 --> 21:02.367
- to get back at me?
- No, I don't use people to hurt others.

21:02.451 --> 21:05.329
- That's you.
- Culhane, look, I had no idea...

21:05.412 --> 21:07.539
That the chauffeur has feelings?

21:09.249 --> 21:13.837
Don't worry. That's what you pay me for.
To keep things strictly professional.

21:15.797 --> 21:19.176
And right now I'm off the clock.

21:27.893 --> 21:29.519
Twice in one day?

21:30.604 --> 21:33.023
What a coincidence.
Not that I'm complaining.

21:33.106 --> 21:36.068
Fallon, dear. What a pleasant surprise.

21:36.151 --> 21:39.863
Again, I just wanna tell you how thankful
I am to be included in your magazine.

21:39.946 --> 21:42.240
You never pull punches
when it comes to reporting.

21:42.324 --> 21:46.203
- That's what I respect most about you.
- Thanks. Enjoy your evening.

21:46.286 --> 21:48.872
Although, if I'm being totally honest,

21:48.955 --> 21:52.167
I wasn't a huge fan
of the whole "Kumbaya" group photo.

21:52.834 --> 21:56.588
It's Woman of the Year,
not Sisterhood of Traveling Pantsuit.

21:57.589 --> 22:01.510
- Well, there is always next year.
- Yes, yes, and it is your magazine.

22:01.593 --> 22:04.554
- Indeed.
- Well, I mean, not technically.

22:04.638 --> 22:07.182
Technically,
it's owned by Channing-Martin Publishing.

22:07.265 --> 22:10.310
Bob Channing's daughter Pepper
is a close friend.

22:10.394 --> 22:13.939
Uncle Bob was just asking me
what I thought of the magazine

22:14.022 --> 22:16.650
in light
of the death-to-print-media trend.

22:16.733 --> 22:19.277
We have an online presence, as well.

22:19.361 --> 22:22.781
Right, but traditional brands
don't mean as much to online readers.

22:22.864 --> 22:25.158
They'd rather discover fresh voices.

22:25.242 --> 22:28.662
Where did I hear that again?
Oh, right. Uncle Bob.

22:29.412 --> 22:32.749
Anyway, I'll be sure to tell him
you're trying your best.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.128
Even though your freshest idea today came
from somebody else.

22:37.129 --> 22:38.839
But there's always next year.

22:41.007 --> 22:42.551
If you're still around.

22:54.765 --> 22:57.684
- What are you doing?
- Watching <i>Aladdin.</i>

22:58.852 --> 23:01.646
- Have you seen it?
- I'm watching it now.

23:03.315 --> 23:07.235
Spoiled thief enters a kingdom,
pretending to be something he's not.

23:08.403 --> 23:12.491
Only, in this version,
I'm afraid you're running out of wishes.

23:13.241 --> 23:14.951
- Yet I'm still here.
- For now.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.497
Well, gotta enjoy it while I can, right?

23:18.997 --> 23:21.792
Or perhaps there's a way
to enjoy it for longer.

23:22.918 --> 23:25.087
If you mean like vacuuming,
I think I'll pass.

23:26.630 --> 23:29.216
You might be surprised to hear this,
but I see something

23:29.299 --> 23:30.509
of my younger self in you.

23:30.592 --> 23:35.764
- The rock-hard abs, the tight ass...
- Your aimlessness, your irreverence.

23:36.765 --> 23:39.434
Your life was hard,
so, you think you deserve an advantage.

23:40.018 --> 23:42.729
Nothing wrong with taking something
if someone's offering.

23:42.813 --> 23:46.441
There's something wrong
with never earning anything yourself.

23:47.234 --> 23:50.946
When I was your age, I didn't have a plan
for the future, because I didn't think

23:51.029 --> 23:54.241
I'd have the luxury of having one.
And then I met Mr. Carrington.

23:54.324 --> 23:55.242
Aw.

23:55.951 --> 23:58.328
And so began your love story with Blake.

23:58.412 --> 24:02.958
Thomas, Blake's father,
he caught me stealing his wallet.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.378
- Wait, what?
- Instead of calling the authorities,

24:06.461 --> 24:09.464
he handed me the money
and said I had two choices.

24:09.548 --> 24:12.175
Either I could enjoy it
as long as it lasted,

24:12.259 --> 24:16.638
or I could choose to turn my life around
and accept his job offer.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.932
That job was here at the manor.

24:19.641 --> 24:22.227
I learned to be useful,
and earned more money

24:22.310 --> 24:25.063
than I could have taken
from Mr. Carrington.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.108
So, you do want me to vacuum?

24:29.568 --> 24:32.195
Seriously,
why are you telling me all this?

24:32.279 --> 24:37.075
So that you can find your purpose,
from one Joe to another.

24:50.338 --> 24:51.173
We're late.

24:51.256 --> 24:54.092
They're about to announce the winners.
I'll check in with PR.

24:54.176 --> 24:57.804
- You're already a winner in my book.
- Are you sure about that?

25:02.684 --> 25:03.727
Lady trouble?

25:04.978 --> 25:08.398
Must be tough. Wife and daughter,
vying for the same title.

25:08.482 --> 25:11.985
- How do you split your allegiance?
- Either way, a Carrington's on the cover.

25:13.153 --> 25:17.073
Look, I wanted to apologize
for my behavior at the Foundation Gala.

25:17.157 --> 25:19.451
- It's beneath both of us.
- You wanna make amends?

25:19.534 --> 25:21.870
Stop taking things that belong to me.

25:28.001 --> 25:31.838
- I don't think you'll be needing those.
- I like to be prepared.

25:31.922 --> 25:33.757
Oh, let me guess. You were a Girl Scout?

25:33.840 --> 25:35.926
You won't be getting
the merit badge today.

25:36.927 --> 25:39.429
- Best of luck to you, Fallon.
- I don't believe in luck.

25:39.513 --> 25:41.014
I believe in opportunity.

25:41.097 --> 25:44.059
This is one I had no intention
of letting slip by.

25:44.142 --> 25:49.523
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Diana Davis,
editor-in-chief of <i>Atlanta Digest.</i>

25:52.192 --> 25:54.486
Thank you all for being here today.

25:54.569 --> 25:58.490
It's an honor to bring you
our annual Women in Business issue

25:59.074 --> 26:02.202
honoring so many remarkable women.

26:02.285 --> 26:05.038
Please join me
in congratulating all of them

26:05.121 --> 26:07.916
on their outstanding achievements
in business.

26:13.171 --> 26:19.553
However, at the end of the day,
only one woman can be Woman of the Year.

26:20.428 --> 26:23.139
And this year that honor goes

26:23.223 --> 26:26.893
to someone who has redefined herself
in business,

26:27.477 --> 26:28.895
a true up-and-comer.

26:31.856 --> 26:32.983
Fallon Carrington.

26:36.319 --> 26:37.153
Yeah.

26:47.414 --> 26:48.707
Oh, wow.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.543
It came true.

26:52.335 --> 26:57.090
Well, first, I'd like to congratulate
all of the women being honored here today.

26:57.173 --> 26:59.384
I wish we could all be
on the cover together.

26:59.467 --> 27:00.510
I mean that.

27:01.303 --> 27:03.305
Thank you for this amazing award.

27:04.681 --> 27:07.475
I had to sacrifice a lot
to get where I am.

27:08.059 --> 27:11.187
Nothing was ever handed to me.
I worked my way from the ground up.

27:11.980 --> 27:16.067
I made things happen.
I didn't just stumble into a COO job.

27:16.651 --> 27:18.737
I created opportunities for myself.

27:19.237 --> 27:22.157
You have to be a visionary
to succeed in business.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.452
That's why
I've recently started my own company,

27:25.535 --> 27:27.203
Morell Green Energy Corp,

27:27.287 --> 27:30.290
which I am building from the ground up
on my own.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.336
So, a heartfelt thank you to Diana Davis,

27:34.878 --> 27:36.212
to <i>Atlanta Digest,</i>

27:36.713 --> 27:37.797
and thank you all.

27:46.097 --> 27:50.101
Your accolades are coming, my dear.
Just be patient.

27:50.185 --> 27:51.227
Thank you, Diana.

27:52.145 --> 27:54.272
I suppose Fallon is a worthy winner.

27:56.107 --> 27:56.941
Perhaps.

27:57.984 --> 28:00.362
She's quite the little bitch, isn't she?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.448
Beautiful, Fallon.

28:03.531 --> 28:05.200
Smile with your eyes.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.870
Carrington, I am so proud of you.

28:08.953 --> 28:12.123
- Pepper, I can't believe you made it.
- Anything for you.

28:12.207 --> 28:14.709
I had a good feeling about your chances.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.003
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:18.129 --> 28:21.841
I'm just glad the award didn't go
to that cyber-slut stepmother of yours.

28:21.925 --> 28:24.052
I'd hate to see my name associated
with hers.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.554
Now you know how I feel on a daily basis.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.516
PS, you and the rest of the world
only saw half of that tape.

28:29.599 --> 28:32.435
If you saw it all,
you'd know "cyber-slut" undersells it.

28:32.519 --> 28:34.521
Sounds like we landed
our next movie night.

28:34.604 --> 28:36.648
- You're on.
- Bye.

28:36.731 --> 28:40.110
It was you.
You leaked the tape to the press.

28:40.193 --> 28:42.862
What are you talking about?
As usual, you make zero sense.

28:42.946 --> 28:45.865
Only way you could've seen
the entire video was if you had it.

28:46.449 --> 28:49.995
The tape wasn't leaked to the press.
It was poured right into their hands

28:50.078 --> 28:52.872
- by my darling stepdaughter.
- I did you a favor.

28:52.956 --> 28:55.834
Now people will think you failed as COO
because of the tape.

28:55.917 --> 29:00.588
- Not because you're useless at your job.
- You're a miserable, pathetic girl.

29:00.672 --> 29:03.174
Oh. Sour grapes from the woman
who didn't get the cover.

29:03.258 --> 29:05.635
Not at all. In fact, let me be the first

29:05.719 --> 29:08.805
to toast Fallon Carrington
on her big achievement.

29:12.642 --> 29:13.852
Congratulations.

29:21.569 --> 29:24.656
This isn't some cheap off-the-rack thing,
like Cristal wears.

29:24.739 --> 29:27.575
- She basically assaulted me.
- You should press charges.

29:27.659 --> 29:29.744
- The woman has hidden rage issues.
- Yeah.

29:29.827 --> 29:33.081
Attempt to do bodily harm
by drowning in Dom.

29:33.164 --> 29:35.249
Might be tough
to find a jury of sympathetic peers.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.668
What's going on?

29:36.751 --> 29:39.796
- You were quiet the whole ride back.
- Oh, so, you noticed I was there?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.005
What's that mean?

29:41.089 --> 29:44.050
It means I thought
we were building this together.

29:44.133 --> 29:47.845
It's not gonna be just one person, Fallon.
It's a company.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.639
A company. Got it.

29:49.722 --> 29:53.893
No, see, the way I work,
I build ideas with the people around me.

29:53.976 --> 29:57.271
That's what I thought we were gonna do
at Morell Corp, work as a team.

29:57.355 --> 30:00.191
We are. That's why I went out
and got us that magazine cover,

30:00.274 --> 30:01.776
to help with our expansion plan.

30:01.859 --> 30:05.738
Are you forgetting I submitted your name
for consideration?

30:06.322 --> 30:08.032
No one does anything alone.

30:08.116 --> 30:11.661
We have a company together.
"Company" actually means "more than one."

30:15.081 --> 30:19.794
Maybe I need to rethink if Morell Corp
is a type of company I wanna be a part of.

30:29.137 --> 30:31.764
I wanna thank you all
for coming on such short notice.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.433
I've gone ov...

30:36.811 --> 30:39.480
I've gone over the financials
of every department.

30:39.564 --> 30:42.525
And as Carrington Atlantic's new COO,

30:42.608 --> 30:45.236
I feel like it's time
we made some changes.

30:45.319 --> 30:49.198
Someone here has been cost-efficient,
accomplished growth

30:49.282 --> 30:51.284
and promoted brand awareness.

30:51.367 --> 30:54.912
And it's time
that person was recognized and rewarded.

30:57.165 --> 30:58.916
Congratulations, Kylie.

30:59.917 --> 31:03.337
I'm promoting you to head of PR,
effective immediately.

31:04.714 --> 31:09.302
I may be new to the COO position,
full of energy and spirit,

31:09.969 --> 31:13.139
but I know a qualified candidate
when I meet one.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.558
Thank you.

31:16.768 --> 31:21.022
It's a big company. People talk.
Women will never break the glass ceiling

31:21.105 --> 31:24.150
if they're looking for a shard
to stab each other in the back.

31:25.693 --> 31:30.531
Now if you'll all please turn to page 18,
we need to go over the Q-3 forecast.

31:35.369 --> 31:38.289
Why promote Kylie?
I thought you hated her.

31:38.372 --> 31:41.626
Because I refuse to work
with backstabbers like Deirdre.

31:41.709 --> 31:45.254
- At least Kylie front-stabbed me.
- I don't think that's a thing.

31:45.338 --> 31:48.466
Whatever Kylie did,
she did it honestly to my face.

31:48.549 --> 31:52.178
Deirdre went to you
and talked smack about me behind my back.

31:52.261 --> 31:55.598
- You heard about our conversation?
- The worst part is, you believed her.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.642
- I didn't think...
- You started doubting me.

31:57.725 --> 31:59.894
And I need you to double down on me.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.815
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now get your ass out of my chair.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.191
Yes, ma'am.

32:09.570 --> 32:11.781
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:11.864 --> 32:14.951
People already think I got this job
because I slept with the boss.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.745
- That is not happening here anymore.
- Fine.

32:18.830 --> 32:21.749
But you're still gonna sleep
with the boss, right?

32:22.792 --> 32:25.253
You didn't get this position
because you're my wife.

32:25.336 --> 32:27.421
- You got it because you earned it.
- I know.

32:27.505 --> 32:31.801
And for the record, I never doubted you.
I doubted myself.

32:32.802 --> 32:37.348
I would never admit this to Fallon,
but my father handed me the CEO position.

32:37.932 --> 32:41.978
Part of me never thought I deserved it,
that it was just sort of time.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.521
How can you still feel that way

32:43.604 --> 32:46.107
after all these years
of running a successful company?

32:46.190 --> 32:47.692
Well, you haven't met my father.

32:47.775 --> 32:50.194
I live in a very large, cold shadow.

32:51.279 --> 32:52.113
Oh.

32:52.196 --> 32:54.907
I would've done the same exact thing
in that boardroom.

32:54.991 --> 32:56.742
No, I would've fired Deirdre.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.579
Smiling to your face
and lying behind your back,

32:59.662 --> 33:01.706
you can't trust a person like that.

33:04.041 --> 33:04.876
What's wrong?

33:05.459 --> 33:09.589
I did that to Claudia.
I lied to her face about Matthew.

33:09.672 --> 33:12.300
I went with you to her house
on that condolence call.

33:12.383 --> 33:15.261
I looked her in the eye,
and I told her her husband loved her

33:15.344 --> 33:19.265
after he'd been intimate with me.
What kind of a person does that?

33:19.807 --> 33:22.143
Cristal, it's done.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.812
You need to forgive yourself.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.233
I'm not sure it's my forgiveness I need.

33:39.160 --> 33:43.372
- Ted, hi. I don't wanna bother you...
- Steven, now isn't a good time.

33:43.456 --> 33:47.251
Look, I just came here
because I always talk about forgiveness,

33:47.460 --> 33:49.879
- but when you came to me, apologizing...
- Is that room service?

33:49.962 --> 33:51.923
Did they remember the chocolate cake?

33:55.217 --> 33:56.093
Oh, crap.

34:07.223 --> 34:10.059
Now you're staining dresses,
as well as the family reputation?

34:10.141 --> 34:12.520
Your ability to multitask is unparalleled.

34:12.603 --> 34:15.898
I don't know what your wife told you,
but we know it's Cristal, not me,

34:15.981 --> 34:18.650
- who's responsible for the dirty deeds.
- Excuse me?

34:18.734 --> 34:21.487
I may have leaked the sex tape,
but I didn't star in one.

34:21.570 --> 34:24.156
It was you? You leaked the tape?

34:26.324 --> 34:28.577
- Cristal didn't...?
- Mention that her stepdaughter

34:28.661 --> 34:30.746
was behind something so cruel?
No, she didn't.

34:30.830 --> 34:34.041
Guess she tried to protect you
from the inevitable fallout with me.

34:34.750 --> 34:35.960
Dad, I...

34:36.877 --> 34:38.838
I don't wanna hear it. I have been patient

34:38.920 --> 34:40.922
through your attacks
on Carrington Atlantic,

34:41.005 --> 34:43.134
but that was business.
You made this personal.

34:43.217 --> 34:46.178
- If you let me explain...
- She may be a joke to you.

34:46.262 --> 34:49.264
But to me, Cristal is my wife, who I love.

34:49.806 --> 34:51.516
I wanted to show you, you were wrong,

34:51.600 --> 34:53.643
that she's not right
for the company or you.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.521
Your concern is very touching.

34:56.021 --> 34:58.732
But did you not think
about how this would hurt me, too?

34:59.150 --> 35:00.776
No, of course you didn't.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.405
For a newly crowned visionary,
you are terribly shortsighted.

35:06.198 --> 35:08.826
I've always known
that you were tough and determined,

35:08.909 --> 35:12.246
but now I see you are heartless,
too, like your mother.

35:13.664 --> 35:16.625
I won't stand for it, not anymore.
I want you out of this house.

35:27.344 --> 35:31.849
You come out of the woodwork like a rat,
whenever you smell food. Have at it.

35:31.932 --> 35:32.892
Don't go.

35:36.437 --> 35:37.521
I can explain.

35:37.605 --> 35:39.648
Let me guess.
It wasn't what it looked like?

35:40.441 --> 35:43.652
I didn't go there for that.
It was for a job.

35:45.613 --> 35:49.408
Not that kind of job.
When Ted was here, I overheard him say

35:49.492 --> 35:53.621
that he was looking to hire people
for his charity thing, and I was thinking

35:53.704 --> 35:56.373
that it wouldn't hurt me
to have a purpose in my life.

35:56.457 --> 35:57.750
Something you might respect.

35:57.833 --> 36:01.504
So, you filled out the application in bed?
Very respectable.

36:01.587 --> 36:04.256
I screwed up, okay?

36:05.549 --> 36:09.094
That's what I do.
I don't know what my purpose is,

36:09.178 --> 36:11.180
and I don't know where to find it.

36:11.514 --> 36:14.725
And I can't say no
when things are offered to me,

36:14.808 --> 36:16.519
because I don't know when it'll stop.

36:16.977 --> 36:19.522
- But I know it will.
- That explains a lot.

36:20.189 --> 36:22.274
- Doesn't explain this.
- It does.

36:24.235 --> 36:26.820
Ted offered me a job
and to spend the night.

36:27.863 --> 36:31.784
I was afraid if I said no,
I'd lose the one thing I had done right.

36:34.745 --> 36:37.706
Look, Steven, I swear,
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

36:38.874 --> 36:41.210
Sad thing is,
I wasn't even thinking of you at all.

36:45.631 --> 36:47.841
I'm sorry I called you myopic before.

36:51.220 --> 36:52.888
I don't even know what that means.

36:55.849 --> 37:00.229
I was saying...
you only care about yourself.

37:02.022 --> 37:04.650
And maybe that's because
no one's ever cared about you.

37:05.109 --> 37:09.113
I know that hurt people hurt people.
I don't wanna hurt you anymore.

37:09.196 --> 37:12.616
I don't wanna see you every day
around this house and be filled with hate.

37:12.908 --> 37:14.493
So, you're kicking me out?

37:16.036 --> 37:17.246
No.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.127
I'm forgiving you.

37:28.882 --> 37:30.593
Thank you, Anders.

37:32.886 --> 37:33.721
How'd it go?

37:34.847 --> 37:36.223
You're right about Ted Dinard.

37:36.307 --> 37:39.143
His resolve is no stronger
than it was three years ago.

37:39.226 --> 37:43.272
A nudge to Sam in the right direction
and our problem resolved itself.

37:48.235 --> 37:49.069
Hmm.

37:49.153 --> 37:51.363
- Clever capture.
- Your father taught me well.

37:51.447 --> 37:54.533
He always has been able
to see multiple moves ahead.

37:54.617 --> 37:56.994
I thought I had inherited that skillset.

37:58.662 --> 37:59.496
But lately...

38:00.956 --> 38:04.418
- At least with Fallon...
- You'll right the ship, sir.

38:04.501 --> 38:05.336
You always do.

38:07.296 --> 38:11.216
Maybe. But my next move is gonna have
to wait until tomorrow.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.594
- Has Cristal already gone to bed?
- Bed?

38:14.803 --> 38:17.723
No, no.
She's paying Mrs. Blaisdel a visit.

38:17.806 --> 38:20.809
- I thought you knew.
- She went to Claudia's alone?

38:20.893 --> 38:22.269
Damn it. Why'd she go?

38:22.353 --> 38:25.522
- I'll have Culhane bring the car around.
- No time. I'll drive myself.

38:29.693 --> 38:30.527
Can we talk?

38:32.029 --> 38:34.823
- I don't have anything else to say.
- But I do.

38:38.744 --> 38:40.996
I shouldn't have used you
that night at the club.

38:41.705 --> 38:43.123
It was wrong. I'm sorry.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.834
I care about you a lot.

38:47.211 --> 38:51.006
And I really wanna make it right.
In fact, I've been thinking.

38:53.384 --> 38:55.803
Maybe I'm ready to call you my boyfriend.

39:03.519 --> 39:04.561
No.

39:06.271 --> 39:08.732
I've heard your apologies before, Fallon.

39:10.693 --> 39:13.612
- They mean nothing.
- But... But I do mean it.

39:13.696 --> 39:16.281
I'm ready to take the next step
in whatever this is.

39:16.365 --> 39:19.284
You're not sorry for what you did.
You're sorry you got caught.

39:19.368 --> 39:21.995
- That's not true.
- The only reason you're here tonight

39:22.079 --> 39:24.707
is because you
don't have any place to sleep.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.585
Your father called
and asked if I'd assist you

39:28.669 --> 39:30.379
with your luggage if you needed help.

39:32.339 --> 39:34.299
But we both know you can help yourself.

39:50.482 --> 39:53.819
- What are you doing here?
- Can I please speak with you?

39:53.902 --> 39:55.779
I don't wanna hear anything you say.

39:55.863 --> 39:59.199
I don't deserve it,
but can I have a minute of your time?

39:59.283 --> 40:00.242
I'm begging you.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.080
What I did was wrong.

40:06.749 --> 40:11.587
Not just my relationship with Matthew,
but continuing the lie after he died.

40:12.337 --> 40:14.590
You hosted his wake.

40:15.924 --> 40:17.760
You told me you cared,

40:18.302 --> 40:20.512
that you didn't want me
to worry about anything.

40:21.388 --> 40:24.975
The whole time, making a fool out of me.
Everyone knew but me.

40:25.851 --> 40:28.312
I know that I have hurt a lot of people.

40:29.146 --> 40:32.107
Not just you, but my husband,
and Matthew, as well.

40:32.816 --> 40:35.903
That is something
I'll always have to live with.

40:36.945 --> 40:38.155
Poor Cristal.

40:40.157 --> 40:43.660
- I hope you suffer the way I have.
- I know I'm the last person

40:43.744 --> 40:44.912
you wanna speak to now.

40:44.995 --> 40:48.040
I couldn't live without telling you
how sorry I am.

40:48.957 --> 40:53.587
And I wanted to say it to your face,
because you deserve that respect.

40:55.464 --> 40:58.884
It's a little late for respect,
don't you think?

41:03.639 --> 41:05.724
And you want me to forgive you now?

41:05.808 --> 41:07.559
- No, I don't expect...
- But you show up

41:07.643 --> 41:10.979
trying to make nice,
to rid yourself of your own guilt.

41:11.563 --> 41:14.399
But I won't help you out
from under that rock.

41:14.983 --> 41:19.238
I was just trying to do the right thing.
I didn't mean to make you upset.

41:20.322 --> 41:23.242
I'll go now. Thank you for hearing me out.

41:25.869 --> 41:27.579
My husband is dead.

41:28.413 --> 41:32.584
You don't get to feel better
about yourself now, Cristal Carrington.

41:32.668 --> 41:35.087
You're gonna pay for the pain you caused.
