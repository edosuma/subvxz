WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:04.205
Previously on Empire...
I'm not giving up
on my group, Ma.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.207
If I don't find a girl
in a week, I'll drop it.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.976
Gutter Life Records--
it's a defunct label,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.044
but they got that raw sound

00:10.078 --> 00:11.712
that I've been looking for.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.182
You got something, and it
don't come around every day.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.483
Let me help you
do something with it.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.850
MAN:
Come on, Freda!

00:16.884 --> 00:18.652
You need a god to produce you.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.521
You need me to produce.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.989
JAMAL: I feel like
you're the new Warhol.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.591
God, you are gorgeous.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.360
(grunts)

00:27.528 --> 00:29.697
Lucious-- he wants
your music, Cookie.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.698
He wants everything.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.899
God's been speaking to me.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.168
He wants me to keep
seeking Empire.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.036
What'd you do
to your Uncle Vernon?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.238
Stop it! Stop it!

00:37.271 --> 00:38.239
(grunts, gasps)

00:39.107 --> 00:40.508
You saved my life.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.343
Welcome back
to the Empire.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.811
(screams)

00:45.045 --> 00:46.380
From the streets of Philadelphia

00:46.414 --> 00:48.216
to the top
of the Billboard charts

00:48.249 --> 00:50.384
to the balcony
of the New York Stock Exchange,

00:50.418 --> 00:52.753
to a prison cell in Brooklyn,

00:52.786 --> 00:55.223
Lucious Lyon has emerged
a free man.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.391
(cheering)
After a four-month ordeal,

00:57.425 --> 00:59.393
all charges against him
have been dropped,

00:59.427 --> 01:02.430
and Judge Erskine Robbins has
granted the motion to dismiss.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.098
Now, that's how
you close a case.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.701
Yeah, they ain't really
calling it a suicide?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.203
Yeah, the Feds
are embarrassed.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.206
Had no case without him.
Damn sure don't want nobody

01:12.240 --> 01:14.775
to know the dead body popped up
in the prosecutor's car.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.310
(laughing)
So I heard.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.078
Good to see you.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.919
(sighs)
LUCIOUS:
Andre!

01:26.954 --> 01:29.323
Welcome back to
the Empire, son.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.958
Congratulations, Pop.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.293
You beat the rap.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.128
Yeah. Thanks to you.

01:34.162 --> 01:38.065
And that prosecutor-- she,
uh... took a leave of absence.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.800
Let's not talk
about that here, Pop.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.069
Okay. Business it is.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.239
Oh, by the way, I signed
a new artist to your label,

01:45.273 --> 01:46.940
Gutter Life--
her name's Freda Gatz.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.676
You're gonna meet her
later on.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.944
Andre, nice to see you
without a shovel.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.913
We got a slew
of reporters outside.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.749
They ain't gonna go away until
they get a statement from you.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.917
I'm not saying nothing to them

01:56.950 --> 01:58.419
so they can twist
my words around.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.288
No, you really should make
some sort of statement, Pop.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.255
THIRSTY:
Yeah.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.623
To the Empire!

02:02.656 --> 02:04.358
I mean, that's your thing,
right?

02:04.392 --> 02:05.826
Yeah. Y'all want me
to say something?

02:05.859 --> 02:07.828
THIRSTY:
Yeah.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.697
Let me see your phone.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.936
COOKIE:
Throw your hair back. Uh-huh.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.472
The angle is here, honey.
Up, up.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.608
Work the camera, honey.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.809
Yes, girl! Work!

02:21.842 --> 02:25.112
We need some more oil
on her legs, honey.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.614
* 'Cause now I'm like,
ooh, ooh *

02:26.647 --> 02:28.349
* See me up
in the club, like... *

02:28.382 --> 02:29.850
Yeah, I think
we got it, T. Cool?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.785
Okay. Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.621
Oh, thank you.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.655
(smacks lips)

02:34.688 --> 02:37.157
(sighs)
What's up?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.660
Porsha set up this dumb phone
with these stupid-ass alerts,

02:39.693 --> 02:41.161
and I can't figure it out.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.464
Can you fix it?
Where is she, anyways?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
I fired her
'cause she got me arrested.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.734
Now, fix my phone.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.968
(phone beeping)

02:48.001 --> 02:49.803
Uh, it's Lucious.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.205
What?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.340
Hey, Ma, I want you
to meet somebody.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.042
Boy, get over here and see
what your father posted.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.481
LUCIOUS (over video):
The truth is, I'm innocent.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.484
I was being targeted-- nobody
ever had a case against me.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.320
And all those people that think
they got a problem with me,

03:06.354 --> 03:07.488
y'all can kiss my ass.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.657
Your father's
a heartless bastard.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.825
Vernon's body ain't even...
Mom.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.662
Tiana, I want you to meet
my new lead singer Laura.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.864
Laura, meet Tiana.
Oh, my gosh, I'm a big fan.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.466
Thank you.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.770
Tiana, uh, can you show Laura

03:22.803 --> 03:24.372
to the studio? I'll be
in there in a minute.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.340
Yeah.
Thank you, babe.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.475
Mm-hmm.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.412
Are you two...?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.180
Uh, no. Not anymore.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.015
He's like that with
all the girls.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.218
But he was just telling me and
Cookie that you can really blow.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.688
What?
He thinks you got
a million-dollar voice.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.623
You know,
I can't wait to see

03:42.656 --> 03:44.758
what he's gonna do
with you all.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.161
You really think
Vernon offed himself?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.802
Look, where we from,

03:54.835 --> 03:56.870
if snitches
don't kill themselves,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.706
somebody else will.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.543
Look, I ain't
studying Lucious.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.878
But if we want
this craziness to stop,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.747
it's got to start with us.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.949
Okay? Now, we got
a good thing, son,

04:08.982 --> 04:10.718
a good thing-- look at this.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.152
So I need you to focus.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.288
And you got this video
coming out with Jamal.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.391
I need you to get back in the
studio and make some more tracks

04:17.425 --> 04:20.494
so you can ride this publicity
that you're gonna get, okay?

04:20.528 --> 04:22.896
All right, handsome?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.132
Why you not smiling?

04:25.165 --> 04:27.835
Fix my phone. Porsha put
some damn alerts on there--

04:27.868 --> 04:30.070
I can't get it off.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.306
* Get it, girl,
get, get, get, get it *

04:32.340 --> 04:33.841
* Get it, girl...

04:33.874 --> 04:35.008
Welcome home.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.410
(applause, whooping)

04:36.444 --> 04:37.845
Gutter Life!

04:37.878 --> 04:39.413
OTHERS:
Gutter Life!

04:39.447 --> 04:42.115
* Get it, girl,
get, get, get, get it *

04:42.149 --> 04:44.151
* Get it, girl, get it, girl

04:44.184 --> 04:46.620
* Get it, girl,
get, get, get, get it *

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
* Bend it over, baby,
let me see you act up *

04:48.622 --> 04:52.360
* Yeah, I can make the money fly
like NASA, I can *

04:52.393 --> 04:53.961
* I'm electric, you can
catch me in that Tesla *

04:53.994 --> 04:56.330
* Michael Phelps cool, but I
could stroke you way better... *

04:56.364 --> 04:57.598
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:57.631 --> 05:01.435
today is a historic day
for Gutter Life and you artists,

05:01.469 --> 05:04.338
'cause on this day you meet
your new king

05:04.372 --> 05:08.476
and president, my son,
Mr. Andre Lyon!

05:08.509 --> 05:10.878
(cheering)

05:13.481 --> 05:15.148
Congratulations, boss.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.850
Ready to get Gutter with us?

05:16.884 --> 05:19.653
* Who dem wild boys,
that dude payin' *

05:19.687 --> 05:20.654
* Who dat?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.155
* You know what it is

05:22.189 --> 05:23.357
* Who dem wild boys?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.058
* They do it real clean

05:25.092 --> 05:27.795
* Who dat?
That's the way we live *

05:27.828 --> 05:29.497
* Who dem wild boys?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.665
* Who da wild boys?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.033
* Who dat?
* Who dem wild boys?

05:33.066 --> 05:34.868
* Who da wild boys?

05:34.902 --> 05:37.304
* Who da wild boys... eh?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.972
* Who da wild boys, eh?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.274
* Step in the room,
they say damn... *

05:50.117 --> 05:52.753
* I was born to love... you

05:52.786 --> 05:54.988
* And nobody else will do

05:55.022 --> 05:59.092
* I would rather die
than live without you *

05:59.126 --> 06:01.429
* And everybody know it, too

06:01.462 --> 06:04.598
* Don't know why we go to war

06:04.632 --> 06:07.668
* But the one thing
that's for sure *

06:07.701 --> 06:12.005
* I was born to love you

06:12.039 --> 06:13.006
* I know I'm...

06:13.040 --> 06:14.775
No, no, no, no. When you get

06:14.808 --> 06:16.744
to that second
"I was born to love you,"

06:16.777 --> 06:18.946
it's the moment of creation,
it's the Big Bang.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.114
You've got to feel
the whole universe.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.416
All right.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.717
Ne-Yo, what you think?

06:25.318 --> 06:27.254
Be honest with him, man.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.556
Don't hold back.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.790
He needs it.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.092
(clears throat)

06:32.125 --> 06:35.062
It's definitely a record where
the passion needs to be epic.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.731
Personal opinion--
not bad.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.633
Thank you. Means a lot
coming from you.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.368
Indeed.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.936
Honest enough?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.738
You know what,
if y'all thinking like that,

06:44.772 --> 06:46.807
then why don't y'all just do
a little collaboration.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.477
I mean, lay down a couple
tracks, see what happens.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.813
You real smart, but you
behind the game, old man.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.281
We already been talking.
It's gonna happen.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.749
Yeah, I got a
little free time.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.451
I figured I'd come
out on the road

06:57.485 --> 07:00.588
for a couple dates, you know,
debut some of the new stuff.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.422
See, now that's a move
your mama can't make.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.957
That's that thing
that pushes you up

07:03.991 --> 07:05.392
to that whole other level.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.760
MICHAEL:
Hey.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.663
Sorry, the gallery opening's
in 30, so we got to...

07:09.697 --> 07:11.231
Michael, Ne-Yo.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.399
How you doing, brother?
Wow!

07:12.432 --> 07:13.901
Man, I'm a huge fan.
I've been to,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.636
like, 20 of your concerts
or something.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.905
Ah, that's love.
Appreciate it, bro.
Yeah.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.807
Ne-Yo's gonna come out
on a few dates of my tour.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.642
Wait, so he...
you're coming with us?

07:21.675 --> 07:22.576
Yes, sir.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.744
I love that!

07:23.777 --> 07:25.112
MICHAEL:
Wow.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.583
Michael, why don't you
meet me in my office?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.818
I'm gonna just
wrap it up.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.953
Yeah. Great to meet you, Ne-Yo.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.622
Nice to meet you, bro.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.860
That's a mistake.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.996
First rule of the road is
you don't bring your girlfriend.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.565
I mean, boyfriend.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.300
Why is that?

07:47.334 --> 07:50.704
'Cause you need to be...
in seduction mode on that stage.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.005
No distractions.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.707
Dad, I kind of feel like
you're the last person

07:53.741 --> 07:54.708
to give me relationship advice.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.043
(chuckles)

07:56.076 --> 07:57.878
Ask your man.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.880
(sighs) Touring gets lonely.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.682
You know that, L.
Bingo.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.717
Now, I mean, don't get me wrong,
there's a multitude

08:03.751 --> 08:05.285
of temporary
companionship if you,

08:05.318 --> 08:06.820
you know, if you
'bout that life.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.488
I ain't 'bout that life.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.323
But after a while,
you do start, you know,

08:10.357 --> 08:12.660
craving something real, and
if he already got the real...

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
I say, why not.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.462
To hell with what he's saying.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.364
You need to be focused.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.166
Everything you want
is on the line.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.901
Can't let nothing get
in the way of your moment.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.903
I'll be back.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.576
MAN:
Tough first day back, huh?

08:28.609 --> 08:31.478
ANDRE: My father's reviving an
old label, Gutter Life Records,

08:31.511 --> 08:34.181
(chuckles): which is
exactly what it sounds like.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.050
He appointed me
president.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.485
He's testing you.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.922
Just like he did
with the music therapist.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.256
Michelle.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.358
And she led you to the Lord.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.494
There's a purpose
to all of it.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.863
I need to protect
my family.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.333
I think it's time, I do.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.838
We take baptism at my church
very seriously, Andre.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.940
It requires action...

08:59.973 --> 09:01.508
and devotion.
I'm committed, Reverend.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.011
You tell me what I need to do,
and I'll do it.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.247
First, clear your conscience.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.383
Go to your loved ones, confess
all your sins against them.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.352
Then...

09:12.385 --> 09:13.854
invite them to your baptism.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.689
Confess to my family?

09:15.723 --> 09:18.191
(laughs)

09:18.225 --> 09:22.262
Your house ain't clean
if your closets are dirty.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.531
Reverend, my family
doesn't go to a church

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
unless somebody's in a casket.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.102
Hmm.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.905
Maybe he wants you
to be his shepherd.

09:31.939 --> 09:35.643
Maybe God wants you
to lead them here.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.112
Maybe.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.117
WOMAN:
Great shoot, T.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.486
You need a lift?
No, thank you. I got
a car on the way.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.388
Thanks, though.
All right. Bye.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.223
Bye.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.559
WOMAN: Oh, snap!
Look, it's Tiana!

09:52.592 --> 09:53.994
Hey, yo, could we get
a flick with you?

09:54.027 --> 09:54.962
Sure.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.336
(camera clicks)

10:03.370 --> 10:04.838
Ah...

10:04.872 --> 10:06.439
one more, one more.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.843
Get off of me!

10:09.877 --> 10:11.111
Stop!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.312
I want that bag, bitch.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.581
Oh, my God!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.316
Keep it movin'!

10:16.349 --> 10:17.417
Help!

10:17.450 --> 10:19.853
Give me my bag!

10:26.193 --> 10:27.260
Yo, what happened?
She got jacked

10:27.294 --> 10:28.128
right outside our front door.
By who?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.997
Two ugly-ass bitches.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.098
You good?
CHICKEN: Hey, y'all,
check this out.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.933
Look what I found on YouTube.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.967
What?

10:34.001 --> 10:36.503
Oh! Oh... look at this!

10:36.536 --> 10:38.839
(woman laughing)
HAKEEM:
Hey, what are they wearing?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.273
WOMAN:
We in that 420, honey.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.976
MAN: Welcome to my kingdom,
Lyon Dynasty.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.713
You wanna chillax here,
you gon' pay tax here.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.047
(laughter over video)

10:47.080 --> 10:48.515
What, is this dude trying
to get signed or something?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.317
No.
MAN: Won't be
no collection agency

10:50.350 --> 10:52.319
sending you
past-due notices, either.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.721
It'll me kicking down your door.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.888
(man continues in Spanish)

10:54.922 --> 10:57.290
Damn. We've been marked.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.960
They're gonna try to
extort money from us.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.895
Has this happened before?
No.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.563
And it's not gonna start.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.833
I'm-a take care of this,
trust and believe that.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.570
* Be alone, oh, oh

11:10.603 --> 11:15.142
* Whoo, I can't feel my face
when I'm with you *

11:15.175 --> 11:17.144
* But I love it...

11:17.177 --> 11:19.679
Yeah, go back.
Those ones, too.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.883
Just, uh... see that?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.485
(exhales)

11:25.518 --> 11:27.487
This is what
I live for.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.823
Everyday people
taking photos of my art

11:29.857 --> 11:31.324
and posting their own
interpretations of it.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.260
You know, when
your music video

11:33.293 --> 11:34.828
goes viral-- which it will--

11:34.862 --> 11:37.064
the price of the original
is gonna just skyrocket.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.565
I want the original.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.001
You already got the original.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.269
MICHAEL:
I do.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.737
Look at you two.

11:43.771 --> 11:46.539
You guys
are hot together.
(chuckles)

11:46.573 --> 11:49.509
Look, I hope you let me use
some of this art for my tour.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.711
That calls for another bottle.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.947
Hey, would you mind?

11:53.981 --> 11:55.783
What about you-- you going
on the road with him or what?

11:55.816 --> 11:59.386
Uh, my dad's already trying
to get into my head and say

11:59.419 --> 12:02.289
don't bring the relationship
on the road, so we'll see.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.524
Well, I mean, it's
Lucious, so...

12:04.557 --> 12:06.426
Personally,
I'm with Lucious on this one.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.930
Relationships are
the death of creativity.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.564
Why would you say that?

12:11.598 --> 12:13.700
You mean to tell me
you've never been in love?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
Every day.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.470
And it's real.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.707
So why would I want to close
that off to just one person?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.375
You know
what destroys me?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.777
Same-sex marriage.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.613
Wait... wait, what?
What?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.715
The biggest advancement of
gay rights in American history,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.919
and it gets handed down
from some archaic institution

12:31.952 --> 12:35.722
that doesn't even believe
in natural human desire.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.226
I mean, look, I understand the
impulse, but why are we so keen

12:39.259 --> 12:42.395
on being locked down in these
heteronormative shackles?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.164
Hetero-what?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.766
It's kind of like,
um, when-when they ask, uh,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.902
"Who's-who's the man,
who's the woman?"
Oh.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.604
He's adorable.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.306
You're so damn weird,
but you make me think,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.242
you know what I'm saying?
Like, and that's what...

12:55.275 --> 12:56.576
that's what artists...
that's what artists

12:56.609 --> 12:58.245
are supposed to do,
they're supposed to be...

12:58.278 --> 13:00.313
supposed to
be inspiring.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.449
It's just...
it's just...

13:02.482 --> 13:04.417
Dude, what the...

13:04.451 --> 13:07.287
What are you doing?
This is also
an artistic form of expression.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.289
Yo, even if I was
attracted to you--

13:09.322 --> 13:11.324
which I'm-I'm not...

13:11.358 --> 13:13.160
(laughs)
...at all,

13:13.193 --> 13:16.129
I-I would never
do that to Michael.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.731
Step up, get up.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.474
Baby, you ready?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.509
Come on.
Just come on.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.980
A mouth is a mouth.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.614
* Uh, uh, uh *

13:34.647 --> 13:36.116
* I'm yelling Empire's over...

13:36.149 --> 13:39.786
ANNOUNCER: Hip-hop's hottest
new MC, Hakeem Lyon!

13:39.819 --> 13:42.622
Multi-platinum diva, Tiana!

13:42.655 --> 13:45.625
Lyon Dynasty's queen of soul,
the one and only

13:45.658 --> 13:48.028
Veronica!

13:48.061 --> 13:49.796
* Put your hands up. *

13:49.829 --> 13:51.899
And we got a few other
acts on the hook.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.566
I can't say who yet,

13:53.600 --> 13:56.569
because their deals...
ain't done, but Hakeem

13:56.603 --> 13:59.206
is putting together
a group with three

13:59.239 --> 14:01.341
smokin' hot
Spanish girls.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.643
And Pitbull wants
us to do a set

14:03.676 --> 14:06.146
on his New Year's
Eve show, so...

14:06.179 --> 14:08.215
Okay. I'm in.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.817
I haven't told you
the challenges yet.
(chuckles)

14:10.850 --> 14:13.987
I've been promoting concerts
for a lot of years, Cookie.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.822
I am aware of the challenges.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.658
But we're just not some
little start-up company.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.394
Well, yes, I do
need a promoter

14:21.428 --> 14:23.496
to help us with
our concert game,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.933
but, you know, I do
know what I'm doing.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.335
You also know that
you're Lucious Lyon's ex-wife.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.903
That means that

14:29.937 --> 14:31.704
people think
you're swimming in cash.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.206
And that makes you a target.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.675
It means you're on
a lot of people's radar,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.677
including
these knuckleheads

14:37.710 --> 14:40.247
that got Tiana
at the studio the other day.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.016
Okay? The streets
are watching, Cookie.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.551
And they're counting your money.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.453
That means
they're gonna come for it.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.422
You know, you are the fifth
promoter I met with,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.858
Mr. Delgado.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.728
All of them bounced when
they found out about Tiana.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.864
Well, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.366
That's what I do.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.567
Really?
Yeah.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.235
The wolves
are gonna come, Cookie,

15:02.269 --> 15:05.105
and when they do, no promoters
are gonna touch you...

15:05.138 --> 15:06.239
but me.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.775
Hey, Cookie.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.377
Porsha, I'm in a meeting.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.445
I know you're busy,
but I heard about

15:12.479 --> 15:15.248
what happened, and I could
fix your security problems.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.549
How?
Meet Whoopty Woo.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.051
Whoop the what?

15:18.085 --> 15:20.253
Whoopty Woo. Look,
this the baddest bitch in town.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.754
It's my grandma's mutt,

15:21.788 --> 15:24.057
and she don't play.
I'm so sorry.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.592
Granny said
you can keep her, too.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.593
I don't want that mutt.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.895
(dog growls)

15:28.928 --> 15:30.397
Well, can I...

15:30.430 --> 15:32.732
No, Porsha. Please leave.
Please.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.267
I swear for Jesus.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.568
Come on, Whoopty Woo.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.470
(whines)

15:39.206 --> 15:40.707
Okay.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.443
Probationary.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.744
Really?
I will call you

15:44.777 --> 15:46.446
when I need you.
Get out of here, Porsha.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.817
What were we saying?
I'm sorry.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.022
I saw Reverend Pryce yesterday.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.289
RHONDA:
Oh, yeah?

15:56.323 --> 15:57.590
I'm gonna be baptized, Rhonda.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.292
Okay.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.461
I want you there.
Family, too.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.929
Oh, come on, Andre, grow up.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.797
You really think that
that clan is gonna

16:04.831 --> 16:07.100
show up for you?
Well, whatever reservations
they have,

16:07.134 --> 16:09.636
I'm, uh, hoping
they can put them aside.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.139
Reverend wants me to confess
my sins to them, so...

16:12.172 --> 16:15.142
Oh, wow. (chuckles)
Confess your sins.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.977
And what exactly
are you going to confess, Andre?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.979
It's not what
you think, Rhonda.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.150
Just about how I wronged them
in the past, and...

16:23.183 --> 16:26.119
and to ask them
for forgiveness.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.787
Forgiveness?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.990
You don't need
their forgiveness.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.859
They're all
a bunch of sinners.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.630
But, speaking of confessions,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.332
um...

16:41.168 --> 16:43.170
I'm not wearing
any underwear.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.172
(both chuckle)

16:45.205 --> 16:46.639
Somebody might
walk in.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.974
I know.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.842
Rhonda.
Yeah?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.178
Not right now, babe.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.980
Why not?
We haven't in so long.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.049
We're doing things
different now.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.484
(sighs)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.086
Rhonda.
Okay. Yeah?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.054
I love you.
Mm-hmm.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.689
We're gonna
have a baby.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.397
We're back.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.502
(sighs)

17:15.535 --> 17:17.704
LUCIOUS:
Long story short, I tell him

17:17.737 --> 17:19.772
he ain't got no next of kin,
and now we stuck with him.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.241
COOKIE:
We? Oh, no, that's your boy.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.709
You take him.
I don't want him.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.411
Oh, hell no.
I don't want no snitch.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.947
Vernon was a bitch,
but he wasn't a chump.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.682
And he didn't
kill hisself, either.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.352
That's some B.S.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.887
You know something I don't?
Do you?

17:36.623 --> 17:38.125
Well, whatever happens,

17:38.158 --> 17:39.926
can't leave him here.
It don't look good.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.228
Why don't you give him
to your sister Carol?

17:41.261 --> 17:43.530
She used to like him.
You know,

17:43.563 --> 17:46.032
he told me Bunkie was
about to shake you down.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.434
Probably thought it was

17:47.467 --> 17:50.002
a matter of time
before you turned on him.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.044
You knew he was a snake?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.147
I ain't know nothing. (chuckles)

18:00.180 --> 18:03.583
So, did you off him?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.818
Did you get one of
your goons to do it?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.254
No, I did not kill Vernon.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.590
Get out of my way.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.797
Everybody we know,

18:17.830 --> 18:19.566
people that helped
build us up,

18:19.599 --> 18:22.402
ended up in boxes that you
don't even want to claim.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.139
How we gonna keep our
family safe, Lucious?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.307
I feel safe. You don't?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.942
Sorry.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.145
That's what happens when you
don't have me looking after you.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.782
You better not have
had nothing to do

18:35.815 --> 18:37.250
with that
purse snatching.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.252
(chuckles)
What you talking about?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.087
Somebody must have
got to you.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.855
(laughs)

18:42.889 --> 18:46.293
This must be really liberating
for you, Lucious.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.594
What?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.196
Having no morals.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.930
Why don't you prove

18:50.963 --> 18:52.799
you're half-human
and take the damn ashes.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.637
Go on, take it, Lucious.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.639
He was your boy.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.976
(sighs)

19:16.256 --> 19:17.857
Where's Lucious?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.792
Hey, what's up, Andre?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.794
Your father's out today.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.331
He asked me to take care
of a few things.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.501
You on the payroll now?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.970
I'm replacing Vernon.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.639
No one can
replace Vernon.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.507
Yeah, you're right
about that.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.142
But there is work to do.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.178
Uh, Lucious asked me
to look into, uh, Anita Calhoun.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.514
Anika Calhoun.
Anika, yeah.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.316
She doesn't work
for Lyon Dynasty, right?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.585
Never did.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.654
Cookie shut her out
from the jump, yeah.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.324
Are you on good terms
with your mama?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.693
Somewhat.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.668
Lucious want copies
of Lyon Dynasty's music.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.236
Finished and unfinished--
all of it.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.004
And he was thinking
you might be able

20:05.037 --> 20:06.673
to work your magic
and, you know...

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
He wants me
to steal their tracks?

20:08.741 --> 20:09.976
Thought you might be down.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.881
I'm not.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.916
I'd never do anything
to hurt my mother.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.719
And in the future, you
can tell him to tell me

20:19.752 --> 20:22.755
directly about our
family affairs.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.292
Of course, of course.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.460
Excuse me if I overstepped.
You did.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.029
I'm just trying
to make the boss happy.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.565
And I'd appreciate if you forget
this conversation ever happened.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.569
I'd appreciate it if you
left the glass on the table,

20:36.603 --> 20:38.705
leave my father's office,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.408
and don't come back
until he returns.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.110
Wow.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.145
So articulate.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.918
And here I thought
we made nice,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.252
digging in the dirt.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.824
*

21:06.933 --> 21:09.636
* So long

21:09.669 --> 21:12.305
* Sweet words

21:12.339 --> 21:15.708
* Don't have no use
for you anymore *

21:17.810 --> 21:19.779
* No one

21:19.812 --> 21:21.914
* To say them to

21:21.948 --> 21:23.850
* So what in the hell

21:23.883 --> 21:26.419
* Would I hold onto them for?
(music stops)

21:26.453 --> 21:28.421
Okay. It's good,
but you seem

21:28.455 --> 21:30.289
like you're not focused,
so this next part,

21:30.323 --> 21:32.425
I need you to, like, really
push the passion. So...

21:32.459 --> 21:33.793
* And today is
a special day *

21:33.826 --> 21:35.695
* A celebration

21:35.728 --> 21:38.465
* 'Cause I've finally come
to accept this fact *

21:38.498 --> 21:40.199
(vocalizing)
* I'll never love

21:40.232 --> 21:41.768
You know what I'm
talking about? The...

21:41.801 --> 21:43.970
No, I love it. I got you.
(phone vibrates)

21:44.003 --> 21:45.271
Sorry.
You-you good?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.273
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hold on a second.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
Okay, um, I been sitting
here watching you

21:49.175 --> 21:51.110
fiddle with that phone since
we started. If you need

21:51.143 --> 21:53.446
to take a five, we can take
a five, bro, that's cool.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.448
Yeah, I told him I didn't want
him to come on tour with me.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.183
He took it as me saying
I want a open relationship,

21:57.216 --> 21:59.185
which I don't.
Okay.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.954
But it kind of spun
out of control after that.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.523
Spun out of control
'cause that's...

22:03.556 --> 22:04.991
'cause that's not
what you want?

22:05.024 --> 22:07.394
Hey, you know how it is.
Like, this is everything.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.697
This is the only thing,
and he knows that, so,

22:10.730 --> 22:12.565
I mean, like, this is stupid.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.166
Like, look what's happening
right now.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.302
I'm in a studio
with my boy Ne-Yo--

22:16.335 --> 22:18.671
you know what I'm saying?--
in this dope session,

22:18.705 --> 22:20.540
and here I am talking
about this foolishness.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.509
He's trippin'.
It's all good.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.311
Okay, none of my business,
you didn't ask for this opinion,

22:25.344 --> 22:27.480
but I personally feel like
you should bring him.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.517
Really?
Yeah. And I've
done it both ways.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.719
I've brought my lady,
I've been without my lady.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.522
And both work, but it's really
about what it is that you want.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.490
Now, if that dude
is your serenity,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.158
if that's the one, then
he's supposed to be there,

22:39.191 --> 22:41.160
'cause the road
is hectic.
Yeah.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.830
Plus, I honestly feel like you
had it right from the other day.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.498
The whole...

22:45.532 --> 22:47.099
"not taking relationship
advice from Lucious Lyon."

22:47.133 --> 22:48.401
Right.

22:48.435 --> 22:51.370
Yeah, not the move.
Mm-mm.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.374
All right, I'm gonna take him.
I'll tell him tonight.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.843
Thank you for that.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.678
Hey, come on, man.
Yeah.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.179
(phone vibrates)

23:00.212 --> 23:02.348
Yeah, I'm gonna
take this.
Okay, take it.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.550
Yeah.
We gonna do this again.
From the top, let's go.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.851
It's all good. I'm sorry.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.886
*

23:16.596 --> 23:19.231
* So long

23:19.265 --> 23:21.267
* Sweet words

23:21.300 --> 23:26.439
* Don't have no use
for you anymore *

23:26.473 --> 23:29.609
* No one

23:29.642 --> 23:32.044
* To say them to

23:32.078 --> 23:36.415
* So what in the hell
would I hold onto them for? *

23:36.449 --> 23:40.286
* And today's a special day

23:40.319 --> 23:42.589
* A celebration

23:42.622 --> 23:47.059
* 'Cause I finally come
to accept this fact *

23:47.093 --> 23:48.761
* And the fact is that

23:48.795 --> 23:53.966
* I'll never love again

23:54.000 --> 23:58.905
* I'll never
love again *

23:58.938 --> 24:01.741
* I'll never love again

24:01.774 --> 24:05.945
* The way that I loved you...

24:07.947 --> 24:09.749
* Why y'all girls
standin' together like that? *

24:09.782 --> 24:11.417
* I can't take it *

24:11.450 --> 24:15.421
* Uh, hey, uh, hey *

24:15.454 --> 24:19.425
* I can do anything you like,
I can do anything you need *

24:19.458 --> 24:23.329
* And I got a better body
than the magazines you read *

24:23.362 --> 24:27.366
* None of them boys know the
first thing about your fantasy *

24:27.399 --> 24:30.603
* And if they tried, they cannot
do it just like me *

24:30.637 --> 24:32.805
* I know
you certainly been gone *

24:32.839 --> 24:34.641
* And it's been much too long

24:34.674 --> 24:36.108
* And there's some things
we need to do *

24:36.142 --> 24:38.310
* So I know you need
to get home... *

24:38.344 --> 24:41.013
I'm feeling this music.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.350
You feeling me?

24:44.383 --> 24:45.451
No!

24:45.484 --> 24:46.853
What?
I'm so stupid.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.455
I should have known
this is what this was all about.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.157
Laura, where you going?
I'm not about this.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.226
I'm not one of those girls.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.163
She talking about us?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.698
MALA:
Sounded like it.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.667
(Becky laughing)

25:00.700 --> 25:03.035
Your eyes aren't
even focusing. Focus.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.205
And I'm recording
this dope-ass song with Ne-Yo.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.040
Obviously.
Obviously.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.077
And we going on the tour, and
he's gonna be doing some dates.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.378
You going on
tour with Ne-Yo?

25:12.411 --> 25:14.346
Mm-hmm.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.882
Boy, Jesus do love you.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.884
I don't care what
the Bible says.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.419
(laughs)
Jesus...

25:20.452 --> 25:22.488
Where is Michael?
He's on the balcony.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.357
* You hit hard,
I hit harder... *

25:25.391 --> 25:26.826
JAMAL:
Baby,

25:26.859 --> 25:29.161
come back in...

25:29.195 --> 25:30.663
(zips pants)

25:30.697 --> 25:33.332
* Holding it in
only gives me more to get out *

25:33.365 --> 25:35.534
* I got the strength to dig...

25:35.568 --> 25:37.236
I thought you two
had discussed this.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.672
* It's getting harder...

25:39.706 --> 25:41.741
Discussed this?
It's my fault. It's not his.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.176
If you don't get up out of my
house right now, swear to God,

25:44.210 --> 25:45.511
you're about to go
over that balcony.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.679
CHASE ONE: Can we talk
about this like...?

25:46.713 --> 25:49.348
Get up out my house!

25:49.381 --> 25:52.351
* Cross me, baby,
and it be at your peril now *

25:52.384 --> 25:54.253
* Won't be all right.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.193
So, Birdman didn't
feel some type of way

26:01.227 --> 26:02.695
when you went on
tour with Lil Wayne?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.530
(laughs)
Yeah, he did.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.533
I told him I got to go
where the checks clear.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.268
Mm-hmm, and right now,

26:09.301 --> 26:11.871
that Cash Money is just not
as liquid as that Young Money.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.539
Really?
(dog barking)

26:13.572 --> 26:15.908
Whoopty Woo, shut up!

26:15.942 --> 26:17.209
(barking continues)

26:17.243 --> 26:18.244
This damn dog.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.181
(glass shatters in distance)

26:25.652 --> 26:27.654
(whining)

26:30.489 --> 26:32.959
(quiet clattering)

26:36.763 --> 26:38.497
Get him.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.268
Drop it, bitch!

26:42.301 --> 26:44.136
Drop it!

26:44.170 --> 26:45.404
(grunting)
Open it up.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.639
Let me see what
you stealing!

26:46.673 --> 26:49.075
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

26:49.108 --> 26:50.810
Who sent you?!
Thirsty!

26:50.843 --> 26:52.478
Thirsty. (groaning)

26:52.511 --> 26:54.480
Lucious's slimy-ass lawyer.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.649
You was taking my
masters for Lucious?

26:56.683 --> 26:58.584
I should blow
your head off.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.319
Ooh, surveillance bugs.
What?!

27:00.352 --> 27:01.487
You want to call the cops?

27:01.520 --> 27:04.623
No! No. No cops.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.495
Get out of here.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.665
You better not
come back.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.802
Tell Lucious
to kiss my black ass!

27:16.803 --> 27:18.304
You packing?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.973
See you are, too.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.009
(laughs)

27:28.480 --> 27:30.482
(elevator bell dings)

27:34.320 --> 27:36.689
Oh, so you had a party,
you didn't invite me?

27:36.723 --> 27:38.290
I'm offended.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.559
I don't even know
why I let you up in here.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.528
Try not to slash
none of my artwork.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.196
HAKEEM:
Wake up.
(groans)

27:44.230 --> 27:45.898
ANDRE:
Will you two stop fighting?

27:45.932 --> 27:48.334
Wanted to talk to you
about Uncle Vernon.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.869
JAMAL:
So sick of talking about

27:49.902 --> 27:51.037
Uncle Vernon.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.204
What's there to talk about?

27:52.238 --> 27:53.973
He tried to sell out Dad,
it didn't work,

27:54.006 --> 27:55.474
and he took the easy way out.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.543
Whatever happened between him
and Dad doesn't negate the fact

27:57.576 --> 27:59.445
that he always wanted
what's best for us, Jamal.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.682
He taught me
that it was my responsibility,

28:03.716 --> 28:06.652
as the oldest,
to always look out for you guys,

28:06.685 --> 28:08.654
to protect you.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.190
Instead, I made sure you were
at each other's throats.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.762
I wanted Empire so bad that I...

28:15.795 --> 28:17.696
I was prepared to let you two
kill each other

28:17.730 --> 28:19.165
so I'd be the only one left.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.533
Come on, Dre.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.502
What you talking about?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.671
It wasn't Hakeem
that had you robbed

28:25.704 --> 28:27.106
at Ghetto Ass Studio, Jamal.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.307
I set that up.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.679
Wait. When Jamal
almost got shot?!

28:33.712 --> 28:35.547
I didn't think it would go
as far as it did, okay?

28:35.581 --> 28:37.183
But it did.
He could've got killed!

28:37.216 --> 28:39.218
I didn't think it would
got as far as it...

28:40.887 --> 28:43.622
It was wrong of me.
I was sick.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.224
I'm sorry.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.593
It's unreal.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.395
There's nothing I can do
to change the past.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.498
I can... I can just say
that I'm sorry.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.604
I'm getting baptized
this Sunday.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.440
And I'd appreciate it
if you both would come.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.245
(sighs)

29:08.280 --> 29:10.282
Guess we all
make mistakes, right?

29:11.784 --> 29:13.219
I'll come.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.921
Thanks, bro.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.322
I'm not gonna

29:16.355 --> 29:17.656
go get shaded by the pastor

29:17.689 --> 29:19.058
just 'cause I can't
pray away the gay.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.793
I don't know where he stands,
Jamal.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.328
You should ask, Dre.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.896
It's important.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.597
But you know where I stand.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.367
You'd be coming to support me,
man, not the church.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.911
I want to help
heal this family.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.646
I want us to be
whole again.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.982
I mean it with
all of my heart.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.818
Think about it.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.821
Yeah.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.422
Thank you.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.424
All right.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.460
Thanks, y'all.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.431
ANDRE: Thirsty sent
some guys to break into

29:59.465 --> 30:00.833
Lyon Dynasty.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.668
Thirsty does
whatever I tell him to do.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.270
Yeah, for your business,
not mine.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.172
And certainly not
our family affairs, right?

30:06.205 --> 30:08.174
This family is my business.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.776
What, Thirsty
too hood for you?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.845
Me? No.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.446
I remember it all, Dad.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.849
I could have been
in the streets if I wanted to.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.885
I chose not to.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.957
You're testing me.
That's obvious.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.693
I'm not testing you.
I'm just telling you,

30:27.726 --> 30:30.162
the only commandments
I want followed here are mine.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.599
Check your faith
at the door, son.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.206
I can't do it.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.675
My faith is who I am,
and it's not gonna change.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.978
Dad, I want to make
a confession to you.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.180
Why? What you do now?
When Cookie first

30:48.214 --> 30:50.149
got out of prison, I'm the one
that told her to blackmail you

30:50.182 --> 30:52.118
and produce Jamal.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.656
I knew she had somebody smart
in her corner.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.991
I want you to know

30:59.025 --> 31:00.993
that I'm fully committed
to you and Empire.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.428
I regret ever
jeopardizing this company

31:02.461 --> 31:03.829
for my own personal gain.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.331
Okay, good.
I forgive you.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.832
Can we get back
to work now?

31:06.865 --> 31:07.967
I'm not finished, Pop.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.672
When I was off my medication,
before I went into treatment,

31:13.705 --> 31:17.409
I felt hated and
rejected by you.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.546
I wanted to hurt
you so bad...

31:20.579 --> 31:23.249
that I went into
your studio,

31:23.282 --> 31:25.684
put a gun to my head,

31:25.717 --> 31:27.719
and I pulled the trigger.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.059
I wanted to die.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.961
Lord saved me.

31:36.963 --> 31:40.466
I know you don't believe
in this stuff, Pop,

31:40.499 --> 31:42.468
but you gave me life...

31:42.501 --> 31:45.371
and God gives me hope.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.575
Will you come to my
baptism this weekend?

31:49.608 --> 31:52.278
It would mean everything for
me to have you there, Pop.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.912
You're asking me to come

31:53.946 --> 31:57.716
and watch somebody
dunk you in tap water

31:57.749 --> 31:59.885
and pretend
that that's gonna make

31:59.918 --> 32:02.554
all your sins go away?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.590
There is no... God.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.992
There's...

32:06.025 --> 32:09.128
You just need to
man the hell up.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.818
HAKEEM:
Laura, hold up.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.121
You're stalking me now?

32:35.154 --> 32:36.588
You won't answer my calls.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.923
I have a train to catch.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.791
I'll make it fast.

32:42.361 --> 32:45.164
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to come on to you.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.765
Did I lead you on somehow?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.101
No, you didn't, but I just
never met a girl singer

32:49.135 --> 32:50.336
that didn't get
down like that.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.604
Well, I don't
get down like that.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.006
Okay, I get it,
and I respect

32:54.040 --> 32:55.607
that you're not
that type of girl.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.643
You forgive me?

32:57.676 --> 32:58.977
Don't you want to sing?

32:59.011 --> 33:01.780
All I ever wanted
to do was sing.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.717
Not for money or fame
or any of that.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.953
It's corny, but I like
making people happy.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.122
When I seen you in that
little bar in Brooklyn,

33:10.156 --> 33:12.624
I was in a bad headspace.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.461
But I want your voice
to touch the world.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.796
You know, plus, I'm on
my mogul swag now.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.533
And you're the real deal, and
I don't want to mess that up.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.203
I won't ever push up
on you ever again.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.004
I swear.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.310
Look, my driver will take
you wherever you're going.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.679
I'll catch a cab.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.250
(car door opens)

33:42.754 --> 33:44.756
Take her home.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.032
* I never know what's
really comin', I do ignore it *

33:54.066 --> 33:55.867
* If I'd-a known a few years
ago, I'd-a made a hit *

33:55.901 --> 33:58.036
* I probably would've
bought some clothes,
even brushed my hair *

33:58.070 --> 34:00.206
* I'd probably be the one
or maybe be the only *

34:00.239 --> 34:02.874
* Go... go get in my lane,
I swear, this hater's phony *

34:02.908 --> 34:05.377
* So I... so I ca...
so I ca... *

34:05.411 --> 34:07.713
Who are you talking about?
(sighs)

34:07.746 --> 34:10.082
You're talking about
your pops, right?
Yeah.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.850
He 'posed to be here.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.853
Every time I spit a 16 for him,
it put a smile on his face.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.224
He ain't here,
'cause he's a rotten bastard.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.558
Hell you gonna say that?

34:19.591 --> 34:20.859
'Cause it's the truth.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.528
I didn't come here for this.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.062
Doesn't mean he didn't love you.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.564
(sighs)

34:25.597 --> 34:28.300
A lot of fathers
don't know how to show love.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.539
Look, I knew your daddy.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.974
And he loved you so much

34:36.007 --> 34:38.744
that if you cut
off his right arm,

34:38.777 --> 34:43.081
he'd reach over and hug
you with his left one.

34:43.115 --> 34:46.051
That's what you
got to lay down.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.120
You got to stop
running from it,

34:48.154 --> 34:52.591
and you got to turn and
meet it face-to-face.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.566
*

35:00.599 --> 35:02.901
* Should've never left me,
oh, my *

35:02.934 --> 35:05.737
* Tell me why you had
to leave me, oh, why *

35:05.771 --> 35:08.440
* Why you had to go,
why you had to go *

35:08.474 --> 35:10.442
* Try'na keep a grip
on my sanity, right *

35:10.476 --> 35:12.110
* 'Cause they don't really know
what it cost *

35:12.144 --> 35:14.780
* For this life, the hurt, the
hunger, the time never right *

35:14.813 --> 35:17.149
* Thoughts of killing everything
in plain sight, your word *

35:17.183 --> 35:18.950
* Is your bond,
if I could say word to my moms *

35:18.984 --> 35:19.951
* You know what I'm on

35:19.985 --> 35:21.453
* But you was my world

35:21.487 --> 35:24.122
* Never did wrong in my eyes,
forever your girl *

35:24.156 --> 35:27.759
* Crazy, what you made me
indirectly, but you saved me *

35:27.793 --> 35:29.428
* From a lil' girl to a lady

35:29.461 --> 35:31.096
* Still a hustler
like you raised me *

35:31.129 --> 35:32.164
* God bless your soul

35:32.198 --> 35:33.499
* 'Cause you're gone now

35:33.532 --> 35:35.100
* All is forgiven
'cause I'm grown now *

35:35.133 --> 35:36.968
* Gotta make it out here
on my own now *

35:37.002 --> 35:38.970
* I pick the pen up
and put the guns down *

35:39.004 --> 35:40.972
* Every word spoken,
never when in vain *

35:41.006 --> 35:42.974
* Speak it to the world,
take away my pain *

35:43.008 --> 35:45.277
* They say you live once,
when you go it's a shame *

35:45.311 --> 35:46.945
* I guess
that I'm sayin' the same *

35:46.978 --> 35:48.514
* Should've never left me,
oh, my *

35:48.547 --> 35:51.483
* Tell me why you had
to leave me, oh, why... *

35:53.151 --> 35:54.453
I'm glad you're here, Ma.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.954
(chuckles)

35:55.987 --> 35:58.824
You know, when you
boys were babies,

35:58.857 --> 36:03.161
my mama wanted me
to get y'all baptized.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.964
Babies don't know what sin is.

36:05.997 --> 36:10.302
No, I think you should
choose the Lord,

36:10.336 --> 36:11.637
then get baptized.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.005
That way, it sticks.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.041
I'm gonna make it stick.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.175
Mm-hmm.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.177
I have to.

36:19.211 --> 36:21.179
I'm not a good person, Ma.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.882
Stop saying stuff
like that, stupid.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.556
I've done horrible things.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.592
So have I, Dre.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.029
But we are good people.

36:38.063 --> 36:42.234
You wouldn't be here trying to
make it right if you weren't.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.770
God knows your heart.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.705
Now, keep your mouth shut.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.708
I don't need to hear
about what you did,

36:49.741 --> 36:51.743
and neither does anybody else.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.746
You look good.
I'm proud of you.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.416
(playing "Amazing Grace")

37:06.057 --> 37:08.260
Hi. Thanks for coming.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.461
Of course.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.332
Thanks, brother.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.371
Great to have you.
Thank you.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.940
What's up, man? How you doing?
What's up, man?
You all right?

37:21.973 --> 37:24.610
I'm happy you could show up
for your brother.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.612
Actually, I'm surprised.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.114
I don't know why,
Ma. We're family.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.582
We show up and we
support each other.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.451
Even if we don't actually
believe in each other.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.720
I believe in you, Jamal.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.489
Always have,
always will.

37:37.523 --> 37:41.293
How are things going
with your father?

37:41.327 --> 37:43.261
He's taking me
to the next level.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.897
I'm working with Ne-Yo,
we're planning a tour.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.933
It's everything
I ever wanted.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.802
Uh, everything you
ever wanted.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.071
I'm happy for you.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.607
You ain't got to lie, Ma.
We're in the house of the Lord.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.910
So is he coming?

37:58.944 --> 38:00.746
Nah.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.748
It's probably
for the best.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.651
That devil walk in here, this
whole place might catch fire.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.819
(chuckling)

38:11.457 --> 38:13.459
*

38:54.265 --> 38:56.702
(people murmuring)

38:58.336 --> 39:00.305
Ooh.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.808
Mention the devil name,
and he will walk right in.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.943
God help us all.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.383
I'm Andre's father,
Lucious Lyon.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.718
Reverend L.C. Pryce.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.185
Grateful you could join us.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.154
Thank you.
Your son

39:16.187 --> 39:19.991
is an, um...
exceptional man.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.461
He never ceases to amaze me.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.499
ANDRE:
Thanks for coming, Pop.

39:27.533 --> 39:28.700
I love you.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.135
I know you do.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.910
Please.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.346
I think I seen some angels
running for cover.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.749
Ooh.
(chuckles)

39:43.782 --> 39:47.953
Oh, let me make space
in case lightning strikes.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.556
What happened, Dad?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.591
I thought you
couldn't make it.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.225
I was in the studio

39:54.259 --> 39:57.863
with Freda Gatz,
and her rhymes moved me.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.766
She reminded me of how...

40:00.799 --> 40:04.269
important my presence is
to you boys.

40:04.302 --> 40:05.937
I was the one
that provided for y'all

40:05.971 --> 40:07.539
while y'all mama was locked up.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.240
I made this family.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.576
This family

40:10.609 --> 40:13.378
that you spy on,
rob and beat down

40:13.411 --> 40:15.213
when you can't control us?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.214
Huh? Oh.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.382
I got something.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.819
Take this bug
and stick it up yours.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.423
I'm sorry, Cookie,

40:25.457 --> 40:26.892
are you under surveillance?
(chuckles)

40:26.925 --> 40:28.393
Sucks, don't it?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.261
Quit trying
to steal our tracks.

40:30.295 --> 40:33.932
Quit sending those
tired-ass thugs to harass us.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.434
And quit trying to turn us
against each other,

40:36.468 --> 40:38.436
turn us all into sinners
like you.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.939
Preach, Ma, preach.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.480
From the book of John,

40:48.514 --> 40:51.082
"When these things came..."

40:51.116 --> 40:52.784
(quietly): When it comes
to sinning, Cookie,

40:52.818 --> 40:54.786
you don't need
nobody's help.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.355
And for your
information,

40:57.388 --> 40:58.624
I don't ever, ever quit.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.591
Shh!

40:59.625 --> 41:01.760
PRYCE:
Andre Martin Lyon,

41:01.793 --> 41:04.129
you repented
and confessed your sins.

41:04.162 --> 41:07.265
Do you agree to turn
from your old ways

41:07.298 --> 41:09.768
and embrace Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.537
ANDRE:
Yes, I do.

41:11.570 --> 41:15.173
PRYCE: Then upon the confession
of your faith, I baptize you

41:15.206 --> 41:17.142
in the name of the Father...

41:18.677 --> 41:20.445
You don't cuss at your mama!

41:20.478 --> 41:21.446
Get in that tub!

41:21.479 --> 41:22.981
Get in that water!

41:23.014 --> 41:25.116
Get in there! Go on!
No, Mama!

41:25.150 --> 41:26.451
I'm sorry!
Come on!

41:26.484 --> 41:28.319
DWIGHT:
I won't do it again! No!

41:28.353 --> 41:29.688
I'm sorry!

41:29.721 --> 41:31.256
Mom, it's me!
PRYCE: ...and the Son...

41:32.157 --> 41:34.459
LEAH:
* Mona Lisa

41:34.492 --> 41:36.962
* Mona Lisa
Mama!

41:36.995 --> 41:39.164
* Men have named you
(gasps)

41:39.197 --> 41:41.533
* You're so like the lady

41:41.567 --> 41:44.002
* With the mystic smile
(Dwight gasps)

41:44.035 --> 41:45.003
PRYCE:
...and the Holy Ghost.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.004
* Is it only

41:46.037 --> 41:47.472
* 'Cause you're lonely

41:47.505 --> 41:49.340
* They have blamed you

41:49.374 --> 41:52.377
* For that Mona Lisa
strangeness *

41:52.410 --> 41:54.412
(fading):
* In your smile?

42:02.688 --> 42:04.556
PRYCE:
Amen!

42:04.590 --> 42:06.024
CONGREGATION:
Amen!

42:06.057 --> 42:08.660
(applause, cheering)

42:08.694 --> 42:10.862
PRYCE: Will you all
stand and rejoice?

42:10.896 --> 42:13.398
(cheering continues)

42:17.102 --> 42:19.170
God is good!

42:19.204 --> 42:22.407
* For every mountain

42:22.440 --> 42:24.009
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

42:24.042 --> 42:27.012
* You brought me over

42:27.045 --> 42:29.014
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

42:29.047 --> 42:32.383
* For every trial

42:32.417 --> 42:33.885
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

42:33.919 --> 42:36.354
* You've seen me through

42:36.387 --> 42:38.356
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

42:38.389 --> 42:42.093
* For every blessing

42:42.127 --> 42:44.429
* And I will sing

42:44.462 --> 42:46.765
* Hallelujah

42:46.798 --> 42:49.134
* For this
* For this

42:49.167 --> 42:52.537
* I give you

42:52.570 --> 42:55.440
* Praise...

42:58.309 --> 42:59.945
What is this?! Get off!

42:59.978 --> 43:01.479
I warned you.
Get off me!

43:01.512 --> 43:03.048
Get down or lay down.
What is this?!

43:03.081 --> 43:04.883
Help!

43:04.916 --> 43:06.217
Get off me! Help!

43:06.251 --> 43:08.319
Get in!

43:08.353 --> 43:09.955
(groans)

43:11.422 --> 43:12.991
Go!
