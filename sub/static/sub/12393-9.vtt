00:04.530 --> 00:06.794
BUT SINCE WHEN DID BANDANAS
COUNT AS HATS?

00:06.840 --> 00:07.898
I WAS CLOSE.

00:07.940 --> 00:09.339

ANYMORE, SHAWN.

00:09.370 --> 00:10.860
YOU'RE GOING SOFI' ON ME.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.878

00:12.910 --> 00:14.229
- IT'S NOT
SOME BAR TRICK, SHAWN.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.599
THIS IS ABOUT SURVIVAL.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.039
KNOWING HOW MANY HATS
IN THE ROOM

00:17.080 --> 00:18.547
MAY VERY WELL SAVE
YOUR LIFE ONE DAY.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.561
WHERE THE HELL'S SPENCER?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.192
- YOUR GUESS
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.902
- IF I WANTED TO MAKE GUESSES,
I WOULD GO ON A GAME SHOW.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.237
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

00:44.270 --> 00:45.760

00:45.810 --> 00:47.300

I FIGURED IT OUT!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.444
IT'S SWEET.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.742
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A REHEARSAL.

00:51.780 --> 00:52.872
I'M LEAVING MY PLACE.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.569

00:57.990 --> 00:59.116
"REH EARSAL"?

HOW DO YOU ESCAPE
WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED

01:11.970 --> 01:13.164
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.293
- "WHEN"?
DON'T YOU MEAN "IF,"

01:15.340 --> 01:16.500
AS, LIKE, MAYBE NEVER.

YOU FEEL IT?
IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.494
- YES.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.622
- OKAY, NOW WHAT YOU WOULD DO

01:43.670 --> 01:45.592
IS YOU'D KICK IT OUT
WITH YOUR FEET.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.234
YOU'D WANT TO CREATE A HOLE
SO YOU COULD LOOK OUT

01:47.270 --> 01:48.430
AND SEE WHERE YOU ARE.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.870
I DIDN'T SAY TO ACTUALLY DO IT.
I SAID YOU WOULD DO IT.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.617
TWO DATES WITH, LIKE,

02:40.060 --> 02:41.584
'CAUSE WE HAD A GREAT TIME,
AND THEN--I DON'T KNOW.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.520
HE--HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK,
SO IT'S, LIKE, AWKWARD.

SHAWN SPENCER,

[laughs]
HEY!

03:02.180 --> 03:03.602
HELLO.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.971
- THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY
FOR YOURSELF--"UH, HELLO"?

03:06.010 --> 03:08.274
WHY DID YOU NEVER CALL ME BACK?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.878
WAS IT BECAUSE I HAD TWO SLICES
OF CHEESECAKE

03:09.920 --> 03:11.182
AT THE CH EESECAKE FACTORY?

03:11.220 --> 03:12.312
'CAUSE IF THAT'S IT,

03:12.360 --> 03:13.418
I HAVE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT
SINCE THEN.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.416
I REALLY HAVE.
- WHAT? NO. NO.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.121
AND I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT THAT.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.388
AND I WANT TO ADDRESS IT, I DO,

BUT MAYBE YOU COULD DO ME
A LITTLE FAVOR HERE.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.564
SEE, I'M IN SOME TROUBLE,
AND I NEED--

03:22.600 --> 03:23.919
- A FAVOR?

03:23.970 --> 03:25.858
HOW DARE YOU ASK ME FOR A FAVOR

03:25.900 --> 03:27.959
AFI'ER WHAT YOU DID TO ME?
I'M SORRY, BUT NOBODY,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.503
NOBODY TREATS GINA REPACH
THAT WAY, FYI.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.167
- WAIT, DON'T--
- [sighs]

03:32.210 --> 03:33.734
- IT WASN'T THE CHEESECAKE.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.577
IT WAS THE TALKING

03:35.610 --> 03:37.669
ABOUT YOURSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.782
AH!

04:27.600 --> 04:32.196
- BINSHOT, BINSHOT, BINSHOT.

BINSHOT. BINSHOT.

04:35.570 --> 04:39.631
[Gus muttering "binshot"]

04:39.680 --> 04:41.204

04:41.240 --> 04:44.744
- BINSHOT.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.214
OH, MY GOD.

- BASED ON THE BLOOD PATTERNS
AND MARKS ON THE GROUND,

05:17.210 --> 05:19.770
HE WAS SHOT HERE
AND DRAGGED THIS WAY.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.572
THE BLOOD TRAIL ENDS HERE.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.417

DOWN HERE?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.261
- I DID.
IT'S HIS FATHER.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.063
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY I DON'T WANT HIM HERE.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.761
IF SHAWN REALLY IS SHOT,

05:41.800 --> 05:43.939
THEY'LL BE NO ROOM FOR FAMILY
IN THE INVESTIGATION.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.665
- IF SHAWN HAS BEEN SHOT,
THERE'S NO ROOM

05:45.710 --> 05:47.473
I'M NOT GONNA BUST OPEN
TO FIND MY SON.

05:47.510 --> 05:48.477
YOU GOT IT?

05:48.510 --> 05:50.501
- HENRY, PLEASE.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.040

MAY GET PERSONAL.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.240
WE MIGHT NEED HIM.

WE DO THIS MY WAY.

STARTED A FEW DAYS AGO,

KEEP THOSE OVERSIZED MI'I'I'S
OFF THE CAR.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.396
THIS IS
A BRAND-NEW ISSUED VEHICLE.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.658
I JUST PICKED IT UP.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.362
IT IS CHERRY,
AND IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.334
IT'S ALMOST TOO SWEET TO DRIVE.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.759
- MMM, SMELLS LIKE NEW CAR
PLUS LEMONS.

AN ACCIDENT.

THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN
TO THE HOSPITAL.

HE'S IN STABLE CONDITION
BUT UNCONSCIOUS.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.144
- SO WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

07:02.180 --> 07:05.616
- WELL, SIR, NOBODY IS SURE
HOW THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.754
- THE KEY WORD IN THAT SENTENCE
IS "ACCIDENT."

07:07.790 --> 07:09.417
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,
GO TO THE HOSPITAL

07:09.460 --> 07:12.224
AND JUST WAIT BEDSIDE WHILE
THE ICE CREAM MAN COMES TO?

07:12.260 --> 07:14.228
CALL ME WHEN SOMEBODY GETS SHOT
OR THERE'S A DEAD BODY.

09:47.150 --> 09:48.344
ON WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE
ARE DOING NOW.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.847
- "THE YOUNG PEOPLE"?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.949
UH, YEAH, FACT CHECK.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.389
I'M A LITTLE YOUNGER
THAN YOU.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.682
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.655
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

09:57.690 --> 09:59.851
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SPENCER,

09:59.900 --> 10:01.219
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
A GOOD COP.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.796
BUT I'M STILL ON THE FORCE,

10:02.830 --> 10:04.366
AND MAYBE I'M A LITTLE MORE
VIABLE AT THIS POINT.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.834
- [chuckles]
WE'LL SEE.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.497
YOU KNOW,
YOU HEAR THEM OUT LOUD,

10:08.540 --> 10:10.508
YOU COULD TRIGGER SOME STUFF.

10:14.010 --> 10:15.375
"OCONE."

10:15.410 --> 10:17.173
CONE.

10:17.210 --> 10:18.609
MAYBE THE "0" IS ON ITS OWN.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.049
MAYBE IT COULD BE
ITS OWN WORD.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.275
O--OUTREACH, OUTHOUSE CONE.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.346
OVAL CONE, ORANGE CONE, OR--

10:25.390 --> 10:27.517
ORANGE CONE.
CONSTRUCTION.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.324
COULD THIS BE PERTAINING
TO SOME SORT OF CONSTRUCTION?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.794
- "YELRFX."
YELLOW REFLECTOR.

10:32.830 --> 10:35.151
- "PEAC SIG, PEAC SIG."
WHAT THE HELL IS A PEAC SIG?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.497
- I'M NOT SURE.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.521
BUT I DO KNOW A STRETCH
OF ROAD ON THE 166

10:38.570 --> 10:40.731
THAT'S BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION
FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.328
- WELL, IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.105
[tires squeal]

10:47.140 --> 10:49.108
- OKAY, SO SHAWN HAS
A PSYCHIC HUNCH

10:49.140 --> 10:50.505
ABOUT THIS ICE CREAM TRUCK.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.972
WHERE DOES THAT LEAD YOU?

10:54.450 --> 10:55.917
- SO WE FOUND OUT
WHO WAS SERVICING

10:55.950 --> 10:57.349
THOSE ICE CREAM TRUCKS

10:57.390 --> 10:59.210
AND DECIDED TO PAY THEM A VISIT
THE NEXT DAY.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.411
- WHOA, FIRE IN THE HOLE, HUH?

11:01.460 --> 11:03.928
HEY!

11:05.860 --> 11:07.555
HEY, THERE.
- CAN I HELP YOU?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.999
- OH, I SURE HOPE SO.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.520
I ASSUME YOU'RE ONE
OF THE MECHANICS

11:10.570 --> 11:11.719
THAT WORKS HERE AT THE SHOP.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.260
- YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.439
I JUST STARTED.
WHO ARE YOU?

11:15.470 --> 11:16.630
- MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

11:16.670 --> 11:20.834
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE
DONUT HOLESTEIN.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.972
- GARTH LONGMORE.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.399
- "GARTH LONGMORE"?
NOW I FEEL BAD.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.077
I SHOULD'VE COME UP
WITH SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.772
- UH, SO, UH,
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

11:28.820 --> 11:29.787
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:29.820 --> 11:30.787
- THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.014
DESERVES AN ANSWER.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.757
DONUT, YOU GOT ANYTHING?
- SHAWN.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.985
- MR. LONGMORE,
WITH A NAME LIKE LONGMORE,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.248
HAVE YOU GIVEN
ANY THOUGHT TO...

11:39.290 --> 11:40.689
GETTING INVOLVED
IN THE ADULT PICTURES?

11:40.730 --> 11:41.719
- SHAWN!
- WHAT?

11:41.760 --> 11:43.227
- SORRY.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.090
DO YOU KNOW
ANY REASON WHY A TRUCK

11:45.130 --> 11:46.688
MAY HAVE WELDING MARKS
UNDERNEATH IT?

11:46.740 --> 11:49.868
- WITHOUT SEEING THE TRUCK
FOR MYSELF,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.605
I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR SURE.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.428
UM...
BUT, UM...

11:55.480 --> 11:57.607
WELDING'S USUALLY USED
TO REPAIR A CRACK

11:57.650 --> 12:00.710
OR REINFORCE STEEL THAT'S BEEN
COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.639
YOU GUYS LOOKING
FOR SOME REPAIRS

12:03.690 --> 12:04.748
OR YOU NEED A TRUCK OR WHAT?

12:04.790 --> 12:08.419
- I, SIR, AM STARTING
A NEW BUSINESS.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.257
I'M GOING TO NEED TO CREATE
A VEHICLE

12:10.290 --> 12:12.997
THAT COMBINES
A STANDARD WEINERMOBILE

12:13.030 --> 12:14.395
WITH A ZAMBONI.

12:14.430 --> 12:17.661
CAN THESE TWO THINGS
BE WELDED TOGETHER INTO ONE?

12:17.700 --> 12:19.759
UH, THE SIMPLE MISSION
STATEMENT FOR MY VENTURE

12:19.800 --> 12:22.667
IS TO CREATE THE PERFECT
JUICY WEINER

12:22.700 --> 12:25.931
AND THE PERFECT ICY SURFACE
TO ENJOY SAID WEINER ON.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.336
NOW, TO BE COMPLETELY FRANK
WITH YOU--

12:28.380 --> 12:30.974
NO--NO PUN INTENDED--
[chuckles]

12:31.010 --> 12:33.069
UH, THE MAJORITY OF MY
INVESTORS HAVE YET TO SEE

12:33.120 --> 12:36.419
THE BRILLIANCE
OF THIS BUSINESS PLAN.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.814
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.884
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:41.920 --> 12:43.251
HOLD ONTO THAT THOUGHT,
AND I'M GONNA--

12:43.290 --> 12:45.588
I'M GONNA GRAB ONE
OF THESE PAMPHLETS HERE.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.951
AND I'M GONNA CALL YOU,
GARTH LONGMORE,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.264
WHEN I'M READY TO BUILD
MY FIRST PROTOTYPE.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.669
- OKAY, SO SHAWN FIGURED OUT
WHAT EXACTLY FROM THIS VENTURE?

12:54.700 --> 12:55.735
- HE WAS STILL CONVINCED
THAT THE TRUCK

12:55.770 --> 12:57.135
HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH,

12:57.170 --> 12:58.762
BUT HE WAS GOING TO NEED
A DIFFERENT PSYCHIC TACTIC

12:58.810 --> 13:00.277
IF HE WAS GOING TO GET
ANY REAL ANSWERS.

13:00.310 --> 13:01.777
- OR...

13:01.810 --> 13:03.903
MAYBE JUST ONE OF THESE.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.271
LET'S GO SEE
THIS GARTH LONGMORE.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.109
OKAY, LISTEN UP.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.118
I AM DETECTIVE JULIET O'HARA.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.549
I AM LOOKING
FOR A GARTH LONGMORE.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.126
ANYONE WANT TO STEP UP?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.128
- LONGMORE QUIT JUST YESTERDAY.
HE AIN'T HERE.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.525
- HE QUIT?
HE JUST STARTED.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.527
- YEAH.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.164
HELL OF A MECHANIC
ON TOP OF IT.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.259
- DID HE GIVE A REASON
FOR QUITTING?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.494
- JUDGING BY THE CAR
HE PULLED AWAY IN,

13:26.530 --> 13:27.531
MAYBE HE WON THE LOTTERY.

13:27.570 --> 13:28.867
- WHAT KIND OF CAR
WAS HE DRIVING?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.037
- '70 YELLOW ROADRUNNER.

13:30.070 --> 13:33.039
- IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE A NICE CAR?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.901
WHAT? DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DRIVE AN ECHO.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.749
- SON, ARE YOU WEARING
CHILDREN'S PAJAMAS?

13:37.780 --> 13:39.008
- CAN WE MOVE ON, PLEASE?

13:39.050 --> 13:41.018
DID HE LEAVE A FORWARDING
ADDRESS OR ANYTHING?

13:41.050 --> 13:42.119
- NO, NO.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.289
BUT, UM, IF YOU FIND HIM,
LET ME KNOW,

13:44.320 --> 13:45.548
BECAUSE HE WALKED OFF
WITH MY MIG GUN.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.387
- HE HAD A GUN?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.717
IT'S NOT A GUN.
IT'S A MIG GUN.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.227
IT'S USED FOR WELDING.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.852
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.237
-AH!

14:02.270 --> 14:05.603
- [grunting]

14:05.640 --> 14:09.337
- SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
AN ASSAILANT IS CHASING YOU?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.974
- [sighs]

14:12.010 --> 14:13.648
DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.648
YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE ME, DO YOU?

14:15.680 --> 14:18.183
- ONE DAY YOU'LL THANK ME.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.619
GO!

14:19.650 --> 14:22.187
ONCE YOU GET SOME DISTANCE,
CHANGE YOUR COURSE.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.983
NEVER RUN IN A STRAIGHT LINE!

14:24.030 --> 14:26.954
STRAIGHT LINE IS THE SHORTEST
DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.025
ZIGZAG, ZIGZAG!
THAT'S RIGHT!

14:29.060 --> 14:30.391
THAT'S RIGHT!
THATTA BOY!

14:30.430 --> 14:32.227
THROW THEM OFF THEIR COURSE!

14:32.270 --> 14:35.262
- [breathing heavily]

14:59.660 --> 15:00.957
AH!

15:11.240 --> 15:12.400
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE AREA.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.772
THERE'S CONSTRUCTION
FOR THE NEXT SIX MILES.

15:14.810 --> 15:17.278
- THERE'S OUR "PEAC SIG."

15:18.780 --> 15:21.442
- IT'S A PEACE SIGN.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.516
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHAWN SAW.

15:23.550 --> 15:25.017
WHOA, WHOA--WAIT.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.119
YELLOW REFLECTOR.

15:26.150 --> 15:29.654
- ORANGE CONE.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.180
- STOP, STOP.
STOP THE CAR RIGHT HERE.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.356
- WHY?
- JUST STOP IT!

15:35.960 --> 15:37.666
[tires screeching]

15:37.700 --> 15:39.895
- GOD, I LOVE NEW BRAKES.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.764
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

15:50.980 --> 15:53.016
- THIS WAS FROM THE CAR
SHAWN WAS IN.

15:53.050 --> 15:55.075
- HENRY, THERE'S ACCIDENTS
UP AND DOWN THIS HIGHWAY--

15:55.120 --> 15:57.281
- NO, NO!
THIS IS SHAWN.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.810
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

15:58.850 --> 16:01.648
- BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO DO IT.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.226
- THIS IS ALL I HAVE
ON LONGMORE.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.579
- DOES HE HAVE A RECORD?

16:04.630 --> 16:06.780
- ONLY RECORD HE HAS
IS OF BEING DEAD.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.229
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:08.260 --> 16:11.229
- GARTH LONGMORE DIED IN 1956.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.999
CRIMINALS DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.632
THEY BUY THE SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS OFF THE DECEASED

16:14.670 --> 16:15.989
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.837
CLEARLY HE DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW IN THAT SHOP

16:17.870 --> 16:19.599
WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WANTED
WITH THOSE TRUCKS.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.404
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE STUMBLED ONTO?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.341
[cell phone rings]

16:25.380 --> 16:28.872
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR ME, O'HARA?

16:28.920 --> 16:30.285
ALL RIGHT, SO WE DON'T KNOW
THE GUY'S NAME,

16:30.320 --> 16:31.787
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY
OUR BAD GUY.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.117
HAVE ANY LEADS?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.253
- ALL WE GOT IS THAT
HE WAS LAST SEEN DRIVING OFF

16:35.290 --> 16:37.326
IN A VINTAGE 1970
PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER,

16:37.360 --> 16:38.725
YELLOW
WITH BLACK RACING STRIPES.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.749
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.326
- WE MAY HAVE SEEN PART OF IT.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.066
- YELLOW REFLECTOR IS THE LAST
CLUE THAT SHAWN LEI-T,

16:44.830 --> 16:46.263
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.562
HE'S CLOSE.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.330
- ALL RIGHT, O'HARA.
LISTEN.

16:50.370 --> 16:51.530
TELL MCNAB TO TAKE
ANOTHER UNIFORM

16:51.570 --> 16:52.798
AND COME PICK UP MY CAR.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.933
IT'S OFF 166 JUST PAST
MILE MARKER 8.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.333
TELL HIM IF HE TOUCHES ANYTHING

16:56.380 --> 16:58.007
OTHER THAN THE DOOR HANDLE
AND 10 AND 2 ON THE WHEEL,

16:58.050 --> 17:00.644
I'LL PERSONALLY VISIT HIS
NIGHTMARES FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.477
COPY?
- COPY THAT.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.512
- BECAUSE SPENCER AND I
ARE GOING IT ON FOOT.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.882
- LET'S GO FIND MY SON.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.659
- UGH. AH!

17:26.310 --> 17:29.438
[truck beeping]

17:51.270 --> 17:53.534
HELLO?
ANYBODY IN THERE?

17:53.570 --> 17:55.265
COULD USE SOME HELP OUT HERE.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.359
OH, COME ON.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.059
OPEN UP IF YOU'RE IN THERE!

17:59.110 --> 18:01.635
OH! OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.999
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.473
AND I'M BEING CHASED.

18:04.510 --> 18:07.377
COULD YOU CALL THE, UH,
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

18:07.420 --> 18:09.741
AND ASK FOR DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER?

18:09.780 --> 18:11.145
- [stammers]

18:11.190 --> 18:13.283
- I'M SORRY I'M GETTING BLOOD--
SHAWN SPENCER.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.685
- NO, NO, SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.223
- WE SHOULD HURRY,
BECAUSE HE'S REALLY MOTIVATED.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.421
- I GOT A PHONE RIGHT HERE.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.466
NOW TELL ME AGAIN
WHO YOU NEED ME TO CALL.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.025
- DETECTIVE CARLTON LASSITER.

18:26.070 --> 18:27.162
AH!

18:36.740 --> 18:38.947
- YOU REALLY ARE INCOMPETENT,
AREN'T YOU?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.572
AREN'T YOU?!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.679
YOU COULDN'T DO ONE SIMPLE
THING WITHOUT SCREWING IT UP.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.745
IT'S THE SAME AS IT WAS
IN THE JOINT.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.759
- HE SURPRISED ME, ALL RIGHT?
I HAD NO CHOICE.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.486
- YEAH, BUT THEN YOU COULDN'T
JUST GET HIM HERE, HUH?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.419
HOW THE HELL DO YOU ESCAPE
FROM THE TRUNK OF A CAR?

18:53.460 --> 18:55.428
- IN HIS DEFENSE,
I THINK I'M THE ONLY KID

18:58.900 --> 18:59.969
FROM THE BACK OF A TRUNK.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.934
- SHUT YOUR FACE.
- [clears throat]

19:01.970 --> 19:05.235
- WHAT IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT
BACK HERE IN TIME

19:05.270 --> 19:06.760
AI-TER HAVING
TO GO PICK UP YOUR CAR

19:06.810 --> 19:08.869
YOU JUST LEI-T ON THE ROAD, HUH?

19:08.910 --> 19:10.138
IDIOT!

19:10.180 --> 19:12.740
DID YOU AT LEAST GET
THE TRUCK SET?

19:12.780 --> 19:14.418
- IT'S READY.
JEEZ, GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

19:14.450 --> 19:17.544
- WE'RE THIS CLOSE TO THE MONEY,
AND YOU'RE SCREWING IT UP.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.150
WE DON'T NEED THIS DISTRACTION,
NOT NOW.

19:20.190 --> 19:21.259
I SAY WE JUST SHOOT HIM
IN THE HEAD

19:21.290 --> 19:23.758
AND DUMP THE BODY
AND GET ON WITH THIS.

19:23.790 --> 19:26.725
- UH, GUYS, IF I COULD
INTERJECT BRIEFLY HERE--

19:26.760 --> 19:29.228
AND THIS IS ME SPEAKING
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE--

19:29.260 --> 19:32.297
THAT FEELS A LITTLE RASH.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.537
YOU'RE BOTH
UNDER A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS,

19:34.570 --> 19:36.231
AND I DON'T THINK NOW
IS THE TIME

19:36.270 --> 19:38.135
TO MAKE IMPORTANT LIFE
DECISIONS.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.206
NOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WORKS
FOR ME, AND MAYBE IT'S--

19:40.240 --> 19:42.538
IT'S JUST ME.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.047
DRAW A HOT BATH.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.298
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO GOES FIRST.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.977
- YOU GOT A SMART MOUTH, HUH?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.544
- OH, LOOK,
I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.514
YOU WANT ME TO SHOOT HIM
RIGHT NOW MYSELF?

19:51.550 --> 19:53.040
I WILL.
I'LL TAKE HIM OUT--

19:53.090 --> 19:54.853
- NOT TO BE A STICKLER,
BUT YOU DID--

19:54.890 --> 19:56.255
YOU DID SHOOT ME ONCE ALREADY.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.723
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

19:57.760 --> 20:00.695
- I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME CONCENTRATING

20:00.730 --> 20:02.357
ON ANYTHING BUT THE GUN.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.925
COULD BE MY A.D.D. ACTING UP.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.962
- I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE

20:08.000 --> 20:10.730
A BULLET COMING FROM THAT GUN
PENETRATING YOUR SKIN

20:10.770 --> 20:12.601
AND LODGING IN YOUR BRAIN.

20:12.640 --> 20:18.044
YOU KNOW HOW EASY
THAT WOULD BE FOR ME?

20:18.080 --> 20:21.709
- PHYSICALLY, YES.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.217
BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

20:23.250 --> 20:26.617
THAT IT WOULD GIVE YOU
SOME PAUSE EMOTIONALLY.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.857
- [cocks
u
-Nog “1

20:28.890 --> 20:30.983
- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.351
MY IDIOT PARTNER HERE
SCREWED UP BIG-TIME.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.890
[chuckles]
BUT THAT'S PAR FOR THE COURSE.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.522
NOW...

20:36.560 --> 20:39.529
I PULL THIS THING OFF,
AND WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.595
BUT IF EINSTEIN HERE
SCREWS UP AGAIN,

20:41.640 --> 20:42.993
YOU'RE GONNA BE MY TICKET.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.668
NOW I GOT A HOSTAGE
IN MY BACK POCKET JUST IN CASE,

20:45.710 --> 20:48.008
BUT KNOW THIS--
ONE STUPID MOVE,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.702
AND I GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH
PLASTIC BAGS

20:50.750 --> 20:52.069
FOR YOUR BODY PARTS.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.010
GOT IT?

20:54.050 --> 20:56.769
- [weakly]
I GOT IT.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.912
- [uncocks gun]

21:02.390 --> 21:04.358
- NOTE TO SELF:

21:04.390 --> 21:07.894
CALL HEI-TY
WITH COMMERCIAL IDEA.

21:07.930 --> 21:11.195
[sighs]

21:11.230 --> 21:16.395
THANKS FOR DUCT -TAPING
MY BULLET HOLE WITH A CHAMOIS.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.206
MAYBE IF YOU COULD MAIL ME
TO MY DAD'S HOUSE NOW.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.128
THAT'D BE--THAT'D BE AWESOME.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.708
SO, UH, WHAT DO I CALL YOU?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.889
MR. BLONDE? MR. PINK?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.751
- SHUT IT!

21:33.790 --> 21:36.418
GOD, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.023
- YOU KNOW, I, UH...

21:43.060 --> 21:46.427
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT
WITH GUNSHOT WOUNDS,

21:46.470 --> 21:49.564
IT'S--IT'S REALLY ALL
ABOUT THE SHOCK, YOU KNOW?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.034
THAT AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW,

21:52.070 --> 21:53.879
THE BULLET WOUND ITSELF
JUST GOES NUMB.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.377
YOU CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.878
WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE.

21:57.910 --> 22:00.208
I CAN SAY, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

22:00.250 --> 22:03.014
THAT THIS IS THE MOST PAIN
I'VE EVER BEEN IN IN MY LIFE.

22:03.050 --> 22:06.178
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
TURNING THE OTHER DIRECTION,

22:06.220 --> 22:09.610
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO WEEP,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.424
- IT'S A FLESH WOUND,
ALL RIGHT?

22:12.460 --> 22:14.690
YOU'RE FINE.

22:14.730 --> 22:17.028
STOP WHINING.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.528
- [grunts]

22:26.070 --> 22:29.073
[crackling]

22:54.470 --> 22:56.335
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:56.370 --> 22:57.735
- WHOA!
[chuckles]

22:57.770 --> 22:59.237
MAN, IT IS THE DARNEDEST THING.

22:59.270 --> 23:00.578
I, UH--

23:00.610 --> 23:04.046
THE, UH--THE YELP APPLICATION
ON--ON MY iPHONE HERE

23:04.080 --> 23:06.207
TOLD ME THAT THERE
SHOULD BE A STARBUCKS,

23:06.250 --> 23:09.219
UH, RIGHT WHERE
WE'RE STAND--STANDING.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.741
AND UNLESS, UH, YOU CAN MAKE
CARAMEL MACCHIATOS

23:11.790 --> 23:14.258
WITH THAT--WITH THAT PISTOL,

23:14.290 --> 23:16.451
THEN YELP IS--IS DEAD WRONG.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.650
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

23:17.690 --> 23:20.659
- OKAY, EASY, MAN.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.622
WAIT A MINUTE.

23:22.660 --> 23:23.695
I KNOW YOU, MAN.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.459
YOU'RE GARTH LONGMORE,

23:25.500 --> 23:26.694
THOUGH I'M BEGINNING TO SUSPECT

23:26.730 --> 23:28.561
THAT'S NOT YOUR REAL NAME,
IS IT?

23:28.600 --> 23:30.033
BY THE LOOKS OF YOU,

23:30.070 --> 23:32.038
I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING PREPPY, AM I RIGHT?

23:32.070 --> 23:36.302
MAYBE RYAN
OR GEOFFREY WITH A "G."

23:36.340 --> 23:39.070
- I WILL SHOOT YOU.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.943
- JUST RELAX.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.880
I MEAN,
IT'S CREEPY ENOUGH OUT HERE

23:43.920 --> 23:46.184
WITHOUT THE WHOLE
GUN-AND-FLASHLIGHT ROUTINE,

23:46.220 --> 23:47.244
DON'T YOU THINK?

23:47.290 --> 23:49.611
WE CAN TALK.
WE'RE JUST--

23:49.660 --> 23:50.729
WE'RE JUST TWO GUYS TALKING.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.728
WE'RE RATIONAL MEN SPEAKING.

23:52.760 --> 23:56.457
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, AND I GET IT.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.764
AND--AND--AND IT'S
AN INGENIOUS PLAN,

23:58.800 --> 24:00.290
TO BE HONEST.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.696
OF COURSE, IF IT WAS ME, I'D--

24:02.740 --> 24:05.265
I'D JUST BE HAPPY STEALING
THE ICE CREAM, YOU KNOW?

24:20.820 --> 24:22.981
[grunts]
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE OVER THERE?

24:23.020 --> 24:25.181
THE JUNGLE?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.099
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:29.130 --> 24:31.291
- COMBAT.

24:31.330 --> 24:32.820
MUST'VE BEEN HELL, HUH?

24:35.170 --> 24:36.694
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.662
- OH, I'M A PSYCHIC.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.837
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.233
- HUH.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.771
- I THINK BETWEEN THE GUNSHOT
AND--AND THE HEAD BASHING,

24:44.810 --> 24:48.109
MY VISIONS ARE COMING IN
KIND OF--KIND OF CRAZY,

24:48.150 --> 24:49.469
BUT I CAN SEE THEM.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.010
THEY'RE CLEAR.
THEY'RE SHARP.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.813
I SEE YOU.

24:52.850 --> 24:56.513
WERE YOU, LIKE, SPECIAL FORCES
OR A--OR A SNIPER?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.289
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
I WAS. I...

24:58.330 --> 25:00.548
LRRP.
- LRRP?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.420
- YEAH, LONG RANGE
RECONNAISSANCE PATROL.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.269
YEAH.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.995
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, THOUGH.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.066
- MY SKILLS HAVE NO TIME CLOCK.
[chuckles]

25:08.100 --> 25:11.501
SO YOU COULD PROBABLY TAKE
A TARGET FROM WHAT?

25:11.540 --> 25:13.269
800 YARDS?

25:13.310 --> 25:15.938
- [scoffs]
EH, 1200,

25:15.980 --> 25:17.948
IF THE WIND CONDITIONS
ARE RIGHT.

25:17.980 --> 25:21.438
YEAH, OH, YEAH, WELL...
1500 POSSIBLY.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.447
YEAH.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.811
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.818
- SOME--SOME PEOPLE GET
PRETTY GOOD AT THAT STUFF.

25:25.850 --> 25:27.283
- IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION,

25:27.320 --> 25:32.485
WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL ME
FROM THREE FEET?

25:32.530 --> 25:37.968
WE BOTH KNOW YOU COULD'VE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.833
I SUSPECT IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A KILLER,

25:40.870 --> 25:42.269
ARE YOU?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.609
AT LEAST...

25:44.640 --> 25:46.107
AT LEAST NOT ANYMORE.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.973
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO STOP TALKING.

25:49.010 --> 25:50.477
NO MORE TALKING.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.156
- THINK YOU CAN PICK UP
THE PACE, MR. VIABILITY?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.179
- THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CHANCE

26:06.230 --> 26:07.754
I WAS BITTEN BY A TICK
BACK THERE.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.324
I COULD BE GOING THROUGH
THE BEGINNING STAGES

26:09.360 --> 26:10.349
OF LYME DISEASE.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.595
- MAN UP, DETECTIVE.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.598
- WHAT IS IT?
STEROIDS, RIGHT?

26:14.640 --> 26:16.267
YOU'RE JUICING, AREN'T YOU?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.029
I KNEW IT.

26:18.070 --> 26:20.209
[coughs]

26:33.490 --> 26:35.617
- HE WENT THIS WAY.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.532
- SO THIS IS WHERE SHAWN
IS LIVING.

26:50.570 --> 26:53.164
ODD THAT IT TAKES HIM BEING SHOT
AND DRAGGED AWAY IN A TRUNK

26:53.210 --> 26:55.007
FOR ME TO ACTUALLY GET
AN INVITATION.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.837
- TECH NICALLY,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE AN INVITATION.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.438
- TRUE.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.573
THIS IS THE OLD
MEE MEE'S FLUFF N' FOLD.

27:00.610 --> 27:01.611
- YEP.

27:01.650 --> 27:02.947
SHAWN GOT A GOOD DEAL
ON THE RENT.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.618
- OH, WELL, I HOPE SO.
IT WAS A DRY CLEANERS.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.015
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF HIS THING.

27:06.050 --> 27:09.053
LAST SPRING HE STAYED
AT THE OLD COLOR ME MINE SPACE.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.751
ALL THE SAUCERS YOU SEE HERE,
HE MADE.

27:10.790 --> 27:14.294
BESIDES, IT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.649
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:15.700 --> 27:17.588
- WHAT? I'M NOT WEARING
THESE PAJAMAS ANYMORE.

27:17.630 --> 27:18.961
- SO YOU'RE STEALING
HIS CLOTHES?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.069
HE'S NOT DEAD.

27:20.100 --> 27:22.591
- I'M NOT STEALING ANYTHING.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.631
HOLY CRAP.
HALF THESE CLOTHES ARE MINE.

27:24.670 --> 27:26.103
THIS IS MY SHIRT.

27:26.140 --> 27:28.028
- OKAY, LET'S SPLIT UP
AND COMB THE PLACE.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.832
SHAWN WAS HERE
WHEN HE LEI-T YOU THE MESSAGE

27:29.880 --> 27:31.643
ABOUT THE REHEARSAL,
SO MAYBE THERE ARE SOME CLUES

27:31.680 --> 27:33.409
AS TO WHAT HE WAS DOING
OR WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT

27:33.450 --> 27:35.338
THAT MADE HIM CALL YOU AND
DRIVE DOWN TO THAT STOCKYARD

27:35.380 --> 27:37.848
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.415
- YOU SEE ANYTHING?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.917
- YEAH.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.780
I MEAN NO.

27:45.260 --> 27:46.989
DID ABIGAIL MOVE IN?

27:47.030 --> 27:49.624
- WHAT? NO.
THIS IS SHAWN, REMEMBER?

27:49.660 --> 27:50.763
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.928
- WELL, HAS HE BEEN
PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE

27:53.970 --> 27:54.994
ABOUT HIS HYGIENE,

27:55.040 --> 27:58.908
OR HAS HE BEEN
CROSS-DRESSING LATELY?

27:58.940 --> 28:00.100
- OH, NO, NO.

28:00.140 --> 28:01.732
I THINK
THEY'VE OFFICIALLY REACHED

28:01.780 --> 28:04.499
THE "HE HAS A DRAWER,
SHE HAS A TOOTHBRUSH" STAGE.

28:04.550 --> 28:08.179
- OH.
AND HOW'S THAT GOING?

28:08.220 --> 28:09.915
- NOT TOO SURE.

28:09.950 --> 28:10.917
- HMM.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.838
- I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING.
- WHAT?

28:12.890 --> 28:13.982
- SHAWN GRABBED THIS
THE OTHER DAY

28:14.020 --> 28:15.180
FROM THE AUTO SHOP
WHEN WE WERE THERE.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.450
IT WAS SITTING HERE
NEXT TO THE PHONE.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.378
THIS IS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
WHEN HE CALLED!

28:19.430 --> 28:21.489
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.395
- UH, "EXPERT MECHANICS
OF ALL DOMESTIC

28:23.430 --> 28:24.692
"AND FOREIGN VEHICLES.

28:24.730 --> 28:26.220
ENGINE WORK, TRANSMISSIONS,
EXHAUST SYSTEMS--"

28:26.270 --> 28:27.623
- NO, BELOW THAT.

28:27.670 --> 28:30.298
_ "LONG-HAUL REFRIGERATION,
ARMORED TRANSPORT."

28:30.340 --> 28:32.228
I-I STILL DON'T GET
THE CONNECTION

28:32.270 --> 28:33.635
TO THE ICE CREAM TRUCK.

28:33.670 --> 28:34.773
- I THINK SHAWN DID.

28:34.810 --> 28:36.232
I'M CHECKING HIS HISTORY

28:36.280 --> 28:38.248
TO SEE WHAT HIS MOST RECENT
WEB SEARCHES WERE.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.339
"MENTALISTSPOILERS.COM,

28:40.380 --> 28:42.769
BILLYZANE.THUMBNAIL/HAIR.COM."

28:42.820 --> 28:44.583
NO, HERE WE ARE.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.646
"ARMOREDCAR/SANTABARBARA
/THE|-T."

28:47.690 --> 28:49.578
- ARMORED CAR THEFT.

28:49.620 --> 28:53.829
THE ICE CREAM TRUCK
WAS JUST THE REHEARSAL.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.953
- I KNOW YOU SAID NOT TO TALK,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.264
BUT I GOT TO BE COMPLETELY
FRANK WITH YOU, MAN.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.699
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
AN ISSUE FOR ME.

28:59.730 --> 29:02.267
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN MY
REPORT CARDS IN GRADE SCHOOL.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.938
I MEAN, I LIKE TO TALK OUT LOUD

29:03.970 --> 29:05.528
WHEN I'M WORKING STUFF OUT
IN MY HEAD.

29:05.570 --> 29:06.605
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.403
JUST FEEL FREE
TO IGNORE ME, OKAY?

29:08.440 --> 29:11.568
THIS IS A REALLY ELABORATE PLAN
YOU GUYS HAVE GOING HERE.

29:11.610 --> 29:13.248
I MEAN, YOU GOT THE JOB
AS A MECHANIC

29:13.280 --> 29:15.077
JUST TO HAVE ACCESS
TO THE TRUCK, RIGHT?

29:15.120 --> 29:16.178
THAT'S SMART.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.188
THEN INSTEAD
OF REINFORCING THE BOTTOM,

29:18.220 --> 29:19.448
YOU ACTUALLY WEAKENED IT,

29:19.490 --> 29:21.651
CREATING EASY ACCESS
TO GET TO THE MONEY.

29:21.690 --> 29:24.079
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET TO IT

29:24.130 --> 29:28.294
WHILE THE TRUCK
WAS STILL MOVING, RIGHT?

29:28.330 --> 29:31.424
SORRY, MAN.
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS ALL ME.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.597
JUST PRETEND
LIKE I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

29:33.630 --> 29:34.733
YOU TIP IT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.762
YOU TIP IT OVER.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.370
[tires squealing]

29:40.410 --> 29:41.331
[metal crunching]

29:41.380 --> 29:45.043
ONCE THE CAR'S TIPPED OVER,

29:45.080 --> 29:47.640
YOU JUST--YOU JUST CROWBAR OPEN

29:47.680 --> 29:49.409
THE TRAPDOOR AND YOU MAKE OFF
WITH THE DOUGH.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.185

LET'S LIGHT IT UP!

29:54.220 --> 29:57.656
COME ON, RICK.
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

29:57.690 --> 30:01.854
- THIS TIME,
IT'S NOT ABOUT ICE CREAM.

30:01.900 --> 30:06.291
I MEAN, YOU COULD STILL GET ONE
AFTER, IF YOU'D LIKE.

30:06.330 --> 30:07.763
BUT IT'S GONNA BE REAL, MAN--

30:07.800 --> 30:10.360
THE ARMORED CAR, THE MONEY.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.630
QUESTION IS,
WHERE IS IT GONNA GO DOWN?

30:12.670 --> 30:14.934
AND WHEN?

30:14.980 --> 30:18.507
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?

30:18.550 --> 30:20.643
YOU'LL BE DEAD.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.937
- NOW, YOU LET ME DO
ALL THE TALKING, GOT IT?

30:46.970 --> 30:47.902

30:47.940 --> 30:49.407

30:51.280 --> 30:52.542
YOU SEEN IT?

30:52.580 --> 30:54.309

30:54.350 --> 30:55.817
YOU DON'T FORGET A CAR
LIKE THAT.

30:55.850 --> 30:58.842
PULLED IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
LOOKING FOR GAS.

TO SEE WHO WAS DRIVING?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.159

31:07.190 --> 31:08.919
A BIG, OAFY-LOOKING GUY.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.450
NOT SURE
HE HAD ALL HIS MARBLES.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.127
HE WAS KIND OF STUPID,
IF YOU ASK ME.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.990
I SENT HIM UP THE ROAD
FOUR MILES TO THE NEXT STATION.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.589
- WAS THIS GUY WITH HIM?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.733
- UH, NO,
THAT GUY WASN'T WITH HIM.

31:19.770 --> 31:21.169
NO.

31:21.210 --> 31:23.075
WHY, IS THAT GUY WANTED
OR SOMETHING?

31:23.110 --> 31:24.475
- YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.808
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANK YOU--

31:26.850 --> 31:27.942

31:50.640 --> 31:51.937
OFF THE HORSE CREEK EXIT.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.858
YOU GOT MORE QUESTIONS
YOU WANT TO ASK?

31:53.910 --> 31:56.708
COME ON, CHATTY CATHY,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.062
I DID WHAT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.102

32:42.160 --> 32:44.458

I HUNG UP ON YOU.

32:44.490 --> 32:45.718
IT WAS IMMATURE, I KNOW.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.352
IT'S JUST
MY FEELINGS WERE HURT,

32:47.390 --> 32:48.948
BECAUSE I NEVER HEARD BACK
FROM YOU--

32:49.000 --> 32:50.627

REALLY IMPORTANT

32:54.000 --> 32:54.989
THAT YOU CALL THE P--

32:55.040 --> 32:56.598

32:58.140 --> 32:59.459

33:00.970 --> 33:02.005
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.405
- GIVE ME THAT!
- I SWEAR, I SWEAR!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.670
I WASN'T CALLING THE POLICE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.371
LOOK, MAN.

33:07.410 --> 33:10.072
I KNOW THIS DOESN'T END WELL
FOR ME, OKAY?

33:10.120 --> 33:12.816
I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME, AND...

33:12.850 --> 33:15.080
AND I'VE MADE MY PEACE
WITH THAT.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.749
BUT RECENTLY, I MET A GIRL,

33:18.790 --> 33:22.157
SOMEBODY SPECIAL,
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.259

33:46.620 --> 33:49.509

AND SAY GOOD-BYE.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.984

34:09.540 --> 34:11.849
THANK YOU.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.678

34:15.720 --> 34:17.119
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LARGE
TRANSFER OF MONEY

34:17.150 --> 34:18.583
TO BE DELIVERED
FROM ONE BANK TO ANOTHER,

34:18.620 --> 34:20.247
CLOSE TO $500,000.

34:20.290 --> 34:21.848
THAT'S THE SCHEDULE AND ROUTE.

34:21.890 --> 34:22.914

- DON'T...DON'T ASK ME
ANY QUESTIONS,

34:33.630 --> 34:35.598
'CAUSE I CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING ELSE.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.108
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.705

I'LL BE THERE, OKAY?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.148

34:52.190 --> 34:54.078
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, SHAWN.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.348
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:55.390 --> 34:59.053

A GOOD-BYE CALL.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.335
NOW TELL HER YOU LOVE HER,
AND LET'S GO.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.838

OF NOT DOING THAT.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.551
- DID YOU JUST CALL ME
"DETECTIVE"?

41:04.590 --> 41:08.026
- NO.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.029

41:36.520 --> 41:37.680
WAS IT AWKWARD?

41:37.720 --> 41:38.857
- LITTLE BIT.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.653
OF COURSE, AT THE TIME,
I WAS MORE CONCERNED

41:40.690 --> 41:42.328
ABOUT NOT GETTING SHOT AGAIN.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.158
- GUESS YOU WERE JUST DOING
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.088
- THE WEIRD THING IS...

41:47.130 --> 41:50.691
I THINK SHE WAS ABOUT
TO SAY IT BACK TO ME.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.435
- I BET SHE WAS
JUST PLAYING ALONG,

41:52.470 --> 41:54.734
DOING WHAT SHE HAD TO DO.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.907

GINA WHO?

42:11.260 --> 42:12.557
WILL YOU STOP YELLING
IN MY EAR?

42:12.590 --> 42:13.852
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.050
SHAWN--

42:15.100 --> 42:16.419
