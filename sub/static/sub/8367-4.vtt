WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.960
<i>Previously on Jericho</i>

00:03.710 --> 00:05.870
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west

00:05.870 --> 00:06.610
maybe Denver.

00:06.610 --> 00:07.330
Are we under attack?

00:07.560 --> 00:08.380
This could've been a test.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.670
Could've been an accident.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.820
Look, I know you're telling
people it was an accident

00:12.010 --> 00:14.050
but if it was an attack, Sheriff

00:14.330 --> 00:15.860
and there's chaos out there,

00:15.907 --> 00:17.360
you might not want the wrong people knowing

00:17.361 --> 00:18.634
that Jericho is still here.

00:18.638 --> 00:22.660
Dale Turner's mother died tonight
in another explosion

00:23.286 --> 00:25.685
--Atlanta.
--Oh, my God.

00:26.765 --> 00:30.720
--Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
--Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho.

00:30.735 --> 00:32.522
A direct, concentrated hit.

00:32.527 --> 00:34.120
Anyone exposed too long...

00:34.555 --> 00:36.473
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

00:38.236 --> 00:38.811
Stanley.

00:38.926 --> 00:40.373
No, hey! No, uh-uh.

00:40.377 --> 00:41.612
Stanley, don't touch her.

00:43.096 --> 00:45.310
How do you know the rain's radioactive?

00:45.316 --> 00:46.541
Denver's pretty far away.

00:46.545 --> 00:48.502
Well, we don't know
how many bombs there were.

00:52.776 --> 00:53.301
Oh, my God.

00:53.418 --> 00:54.350
We got something!

00:54.448 --> 00:56.170
Are they just reporting it
or are they behind it?

00:56.178 --> 00:57.471
Maybe we're being invaded.

00:57.476 --> 00:58.541
If this country is at war,

00:58.545 --> 00:59.631
we need to know it.

01:00.025 --> 01:01.142
More than electricity or food,

01:01.146 --> 01:02.310
this town needs information.

01:02.318 --> 01:04.530
--We can't just sit here in the dark.
--He's right.

01:04.724 --> 01:06.043
Makes us too vulnerable.

01:06.046 --> 01:07.621
We could organize a group of people

01:07.626 --> 01:09.063
send them out in every direction

01:09.066 --> 01:11.912
--The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
--Let's hope not.

01:39.858 --> 01:41.301
I'm telling you, it's the Midwest.

01:41.657 --> 01:43.530
From the skyline, I'm thinking Cincinnati.

01:43.906 --> 01:46.012
I wish we could read the license plates.

01:48.207 --> 01:50.482
Let's make Cincinnati a question mark.

02:09.235 --> 02:11.302
--Jake.
--Hey, Stanley. Hey, Bonnie.

02:11.306 --> 02:14.212
--Anything new?
--No, not since yesterday.

02:14.887 --> 02:16.733
Shep and Gray should have been back by now.

02:17.857 --> 02:20.872
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out.

02:23.657 --> 02:27.062
God, it makes you wonder
what happened to whoever shot this.

02:28.755 --> 02:31.262
I think that might have been
the last thing they ever saw.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.191
The generator's running out of gas.

02:52.197 --> 02:53.700
We're going to lose the TV.

02:54.635 --> 02:55.850
I'll take care of it.

02:56.948 --> 02:57.872
How can you?

02:58.026 --> 02:59.792
Gas pumps don't work at the station

02:59.976 --> 03:00.991
with the power down.

03:01.155 --> 03:02.762
Look, I don't want you to worry.

03:10.015 --> 03:10.950
Sorry, folks.

03:11.198 --> 03:12.600
We're closing early tonight.

03:12.695 --> 03:13.372
Take a flashlight,

03:13.377 --> 03:14.211
it's dark out there.

03:14.217 --> 03:15.583
What? It's only 9:30.

03:15.585 --> 03:16.331
You heard her,

03:16.335 --> 03:17.283
let's move it, folks.

03:17.286 --> 03:18.310
Time to go home.

03:18.468 --> 03:19.521
Let's move it out.

03:29.568 --> 03:31.531
--Hey.
--Hey.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.632
--Is the generator out?
--No, out of booze.

03:36.078 --> 03:38.872
--Any more images?
--No, just the same loop.

03:38.878 --> 03:40.512
Come on, I'll walk you home.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.192
Where do you live?

03:42.897 --> 03:43.810
That way.

03:46.425 --> 03:49.570
So is it weird being home after so long?

03:50.116 --> 03:51.092
A little bit.

03:51.488 --> 03:54.702
I still can't get used to Bailey's
without the mechanical bull.

03:55.446 --> 03:57.561
Stanley must have cried
when they took that out.

03:57.565 --> 03:58.890
He had the record.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.211
When did the Pizza Garden
become the Cyberjolt Cafe?

04:03.216 --> 04:05.952
Oh, when the Health Department
shut down the Pizza Garden.

04:06.095 --> 04:06.662
What?!

04:06.715 --> 04:11.923
--Oh, don't tell me you liked the Pizza Garden.
--I used to work there washing dishes.

04:12.036 --> 04:14.193
Oh, you must not have done a very good job.

04:17.377 --> 04:18.740
That came from the alley.

04:33.785 --> 04:34.960
It's the pharmacy.

04:42.957 --> 04:44.291
Why don't you go get some help?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.410
Help...

05:13.125 --> 05:14.611
H... Help.

05:28.068 --> 05:28.812
Jake.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.010
Who is he?

05:36.015 --> 05:37.773
I don't know. Help me get him out of here.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.591
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit.

05:39.596 --> 05:41.463
We got to get him to a doctor, now.

05:45.227 --> 05:47.223
Is that radiation sickness?

05:47.465 --> 05:48.370
I think it might be.

05:52.648 --> 05:56.031
--Heather, Heather.
Get her out.
--Okay. Let's go.

05:56.195 --> 05:58.000
Come on, Bill, let's go.

05:58.597 --> 06:01.143
--Help us pick him up.
--I'm not touching him.
No way. Not me.

06:01.146 --> 06:02.820
He could be contagious.

06:02.827 --> 06:04.170
He's not contagious, Bill.

06:04.608 --> 06:05.790
I'm  sorry, Stanley.

06:05.797 --> 06:08.262
What if it was me lying here, Bill?
Would you walk away then?

06:09.856 --> 06:11.743
We could get sick touching that guy.

06:13.305 --> 06:14.602
It's not like with you, Stanley.

06:14.746 --> 06:16.670
We don't even know who this guy is.

06:16.925 --> 06:19.710
I just stopped by Bailey's
to check on the TV signal.

06:20.018 --> 06:23.290
--Can't you cut your husband some slack?
--And that took three hours?

06:24.866 --> 06:29.131
--I was only there for, like, an hour.
--We're in a state of emergency, Eric.

06:29.926 --> 06:31.263
I'm aware of that, April.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.082
Dr. Peterson's gone to Kansas City
to look for his daughter.

06:34.088 --> 06:36.522
--And Dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours.
--Well, I am here now.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.532
--What do you want from me?
--And you... decided to go have a beer.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.740
I've got a baby on a ventilator

06:42.747 --> 06:44.630
and the generator is almost out of gas.

06:44.746 --> 06:46.650
Well, don't you have a hand pump?

06:48.256 --> 06:49.703
Who'd pump it?

06:49.708 --> 06:50.123
Out of the way.

06:50.318 --> 06:51.293
Out of the way.

06:51.847 --> 06:52.863
Out  of the way!

06:53.277 --> 06:56.183
--April, he's having trouble breathing.
--Get him in Room Three.

07:22.138 --> 07:23.090
Who is that?

07:23.958 --> 07:25.092
Who's in there?

07:27.586 --> 07:28.660
Hello?

07:32.855 --> 07:34.123
Who is that?

07:37.226 --> 07:40.710
--It's  just me, Mrs. Leigh.
--Oh, Dale.

07:40.717 --> 07:41.651
What are you up to?

07:41.656 --> 07:44.803
--You scared me to death.
--It was supposed to be a surprise.

07:44.845 --> 07:45.852
What?

07:48.965 --> 07:49.883
Oh...

07:54.786 --> 07:56.472
Where did you get all this?

07:56.757 --> 07:58.123
The train that never showed up.

07:58.127 --> 07:59.081
It smashed into a car.

07:59.088 --> 08:00.653
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.

08:00.846 --> 08:02.921
It's just about five miles outside of town.

08:03.848 --> 08:06.322
Well, we can't just take it, it's not ours.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.343
Not all of it, anyway.

08:08.577 --> 08:09.901
The town took your food.

08:11.006 --> 08:12.772
Well, it was an emergency.

08:13.357 --> 08:14.610
And so is this.

08:16.476 --> 08:17.493
The hell with them.

08:25.846 --> 08:27.033
Who is this man?

08:27.227 --> 08:28.642
Anyone recognize him?

08:29.236 --> 08:30.573
Not so far.

08:31.868 --> 08:33.390
Those burns...

08:33.947 --> 08:37.700
--Does that mean that he was close to the blast?
--Why'd he come to Jericho?

08:38.017 --> 08:41.111
--It's a hell of a way from Denver.
--Maybe he's related to someone in town.

08:41.345 --> 08:43.303
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy?

08:44.748 --> 08:47.233
--Any I.D.?
--No, just some keys.

08:47.231 --> 08:48.604
He doesn't even have a wallet.

08:53.488 --> 08:56.220
--Is he going to be okay?
--Depends on the dose that he got.

09:00.386 --> 09:02.335
Son, you and Stanley should go wash up.

09:02.335 --> 09:05.260
--Those clothes might still be contaminated.
--There's a shower down the hall.

09:21.018 --> 09:21.682
Dad.

09:21.998 --> 09:23.290
We got another situation.

09:23.525 --> 09:25.830
There's not much more gas
in the generator here.

09:26.416 --> 09:27.993
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight.

09:28.187 --> 09:30.852
That was the only satellite dish
in town getting a signal

09:31.175 --> 09:33.252
our only link to the outside world.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.380
--You okay?
--Yeah.

09:36.808 --> 09:39.661
We're going to have to get people to siphon
gas out of their cars.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.170
What if more come?

09:41.646 --> 09:44.040
There's not enough gas to keep the clinics
going for all of them.

09:44.237 --> 09:48.323
--You saying we ought to turn them away?
--No, I'm saying we have limited resources.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.491
Well, for right now, let's just get
as much as we can.

09:51.978 --> 09:53.480
Some of the nurses are spooked.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.123
They're worried about contamination.

09:55.198 --> 09:57.741
Honey, I'll do anything I can to help you.

09:59.578 --> 10:01.970
If you could, keep an eye on this baby

10:02.968 --> 10:05.281
then I could see to the other patients.

10:05.788 --> 10:06.802
Sure.

10:07.338 --> 10:09.141
I hope to God the power doesn't go.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.593
Look, we'll do everything we can

10:11.598 --> 10:12.963
until we can't.

10:42.697 --> 10:44.020
Dad, it's Sam.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.733
Dad, I'm thirsty, are you in there?

10:52.187 --> 10:54.263
--Any word from Shep or Gray?
--No, Mayor.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.020
Still can't get 'em on the radio.

10:56.028 --> 10:58.781
Maybe they got captured by
those tanks Stanley saw.

10:59.887 --> 11:02.641
Those tanks are probably just National Guard

11:02.646 --> 11:03.922
--okay? So--
--You don't know that.

11:04.555 --> 11:06.210
--They could be--
--Shh.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.280
They could be China,

11:10.535 --> 11:11.390
they could be Iran.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.223
Al Qaeda, North Korea--

11:13.427 --> 11:14.711
anybody who hates us.

11:14.928 --> 11:17.502
They could be coming here and what's
our line of defense?

11:20.465 --> 11:21.493
You're looking at it.

11:28.065 --> 11:28.930
Jake?

11:32.397 --> 11:33.211
Oh.

11:33.388 --> 11:34.671
Had to take a shower.

11:35.385 --> 11:39.042
--Go ahead.
--No, I I did; I just took a shower.

11:39.305 --> 11:41.542
Oh, right.

11:42.058 --> 11:43.222
So what's up?

11:44.768 --> 11:45.662
I...

11:46.568 --> 11:48.880
April said that the medical
center was running low

11:48.888 --> 11:50.330
on gasoline for the generator

11:50.418 --> 11:52.780
and it occurred to me that
if we had a length of hose

11:52.787 --> 11:55.370
and a funnel, we could siphon
gas out of our cars.

11:55.557 --> 11:59.251
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas
in the tanks at Murthy's gas station

11:59.678 --> 12:03.042
and if we could get enough suction we could
get all the gas we wanted...

12:03.316 --> 12:04.800
Would a water pump do it?

12:17.316 --> 12:18.103
Bonnie.

12:20.788 --> 12:22.511
This could be my brother.

12:23.215 --> 12:26.503
--Is this how they die?
--No. Stanley didn't get it this bad.

12:26.508 --> 12:29.671
--He could still got cancer.
--No, we don't know that.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.543
Listen.

12:32.098 --> 12:33.381
Don't worry about me,

12:33.386 --> 12:34.273
I'll be fine.

12:38.456 --> 12:39.863
Take care of him.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.772
I'm going to have to put him on a ventilator

12:49.778 --> 12:50.870
it'll use up power but--

12:51.095 --> 12:53.012
But the baby has the better chance for survival

12:53.015 --> 12:55.721
--save the generator for the baby.
--Hey, hey, hey, what about him?

12:56.705 --> 12:57.920
Give him something for the pain.

12:57.928 --> 13:00.173
--Keep him comfortable.
--Sit back and watch him die.

13:00.176 --> 13:01.111
Well, I don't like it, Jake,

13:01.116 --> 13:03.223
but that's the most rational
option we have right now.

13:03.498 --> 13:05.061
Unless you can think of something better.

13:08.665 --> 13:11.183
--Will your generator last until morning?
--I think so.

13:11.227 --> 13:12.640
All right, give me until then.

13:21.297 --> 13:22.702
Can you tell me your name?

13:25.156 --> 13:26.173
Victor.

13:27.916 --> 13:28.823
Miller.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.133
Victor.

13:31.087 --> 13:32.780
Victor, you're in a medical clinic.

13:33.047 --> 13:36.221
--Okay, we're going to take care of you.
--No, no.

13:37.735 --> 13:39.110
They're coming.

13:42.168 --> 13:44.281
They're coming.

14:03.465 --> 14:05.622
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious?

14:06.518 --> 14:07.730
Could be a long time.

14:08.366 --> 14:09.971
If he ever wakes up again.

14:10.618 --> 14:11.483
Who are "they"?

14:12.078 --> 14:13.051
Who's coming?

14:13.486 --> 14:17.413
Well, maybe he saw passengers
from one of those planes.

14:17.415 --> 14:18.853
He could've meant terrorists.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.031
Unless he wakes up,

14:20.036 --> 14:21.791
we don't know what kind of danger we're in.

14:22.027 --> 14:22.852
For right now,

14:22.857 --> 14:24.460
hire as many deputies as you can

14:24.468 --> 14:26.201
use  them to help you get gas.

14:26.206 --> 14:27.360
Clinic's running low.

14:27.786 --> 14:28.821
But it's not my gas,

14:28.826 --> 14:29.993
it belongs to Noraco.

14:29.998 --> 14:31.483
It's no use to anyone, Mr. Murthy.

14:31.487 --> 14:33.510
Without electricity, the pumps don't even work.

14:33.668 --> 14:36.952
--And we'll leave you an I.O.U. for the 500 gallons.
--I could be fired.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.871
With all due respect, who's going to fire you?

14:39.568 --> 14:41.390
It's a different world now, Mr. Murthy.

14:44.498 --> 14:45.413
All right, let's get them open.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.160
Stanley will be here any second.

14:56.055 --> 14:57.582
They're never coming back.

14:58.138 --> 15:00.372
The district manager, any of them.

15:01.345 --> 15:02.211
Are they?

15:05.548 --> 15:06.572
No.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.380
Shortly after my mother died,

15:11.385 --> 15:13.481
my husband was transferred to St. Louis.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.753
It was hard to leave Memphis,

15:15.756 --> 15:17.081
because it was our home.

15:17.168 --> 15:20.103
But eventually we learned to love it.

15:21.307 --> 15:22.693
How did your mother die?

15:23.086 --> 15:24.101
M.S.

15:25.996 --> 15:26.682
Aly,

15:26.935 --> 15:28.940
what area of St. Louis are we from?

15:29.366 --> 15:31.681
--Kirkwood.
--Which is where?
--Near Powder Valley.

15:31.687 --> 15:33.551
Lots of hiking, trails and nature.

15:33.778 --> 15:34.890
We love to hike.

15:36.065 --> 15:39.550
--Sam, where'd you go to school?
--The Crow School.

15:39.737 --> 15:40.943
Crow Island School.

15:40.946 --> 15:42.500
God, we've gone over this so many times.

15:42.507 --> 15:44.180
And we'll go over it again and again

15:44.197 --> 15:45.431
until we get it right.

15:45.498 --> 15:46.352
Mom...

15:47.248 --> 15:48.662
You know what, I can't keep doing this.

15:48.668 --> 15:49.733
Keep Samuel inside.

15:49.738 --> 15:50.580
I've got my story.

15:50.585 --> 15:50.972
Hey.

15:51.207 --> 15:52.203
We lived in a two-bedroom house

15:52.205 --> 15:53.210
we drove a green Volvo,

15:53.216 --> 15:54.962
we had a stay-at-home mom, which is bull

15:55.065 --> 15:56.091
because she worked all the time

15:56.096 --> 15:57.991
because our dad was never around.

16:02.005 --> 16:03.063
Upstairs. Go on.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.821
--You got a minute?
--Of course.

16:19.497 --> 16:22.781
You probably heard the, uh,
Sheriff's been killed, along with
three more of our men.

16:22.967 --> 16:24.190
I  heard.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.272
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:26.636 --> 16:27.421
Thank you.

16:27.935 --> 16:29.461
Well, we're down to just me and Bill, and

16:29.656 --> 16:32.051
neither of us is trained for
a national emergency.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.402
I don't think anyone is prepared for this.

16:34.555 --> 16:36.161
We need a few more deputies.

16:36.555 --> 16:39.341
--And I thought since you were a cop in
St. Louis and all...
--No.

16:39.685 --> 16:42.402
It's a very flattering offer, but I'm still
settling my family.

16:42.406 --> 16:43.922
It'd just be for the time being.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.253
Look, Mr. Hawkins, people are on edge.

16:49.946 --> 16:52.610
All right, we've got break-ins
and kids vandalizing.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.512
We just need some more manpower to show people

16:54.517 --> 16:56.311
there's still law and order in this town.

17:00.138 --> 17:00.991
All right.

17:01.477 --> 17:02.493
When do I start?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.420
You're already on the clock.

17:09.464 --> 17:12.090
We're asking everyone in town to donate
five gallons of gas.

17:13.287 --> 17:14.452
Sorry, honey.

17:14.627 --> 17:15.680
I need my car.

17:15.998 --> 17:19.171
But, Gracie, if the clinic
goes down, people could die.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.522
I sympathize, Eric,

17:20.528 --> 17:22.861
but I already gave this town my whole store.

17:23.056 --> 17:25.441
Someone else can donate gas.

17:33.187 --> 17:33.931
Bill.

17:34.238 --> 17:35.132
What's up?

17:35.146 --> 17:36.823
I'm going to head to the clinic
with what I've got.

17:36.825 --> 17:38.192
How are things on your end?

17:38.197 --> 17:39.513
It's not looking good.

17:39.596 --> 17:41.672
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic.

17:41.857 --> 17:42.840
People are scared, Eric.

17:42.976 --> 17:44.070
They're hoarding.

17:44.705 --> 17:46.862
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.023
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container.

17:57.028 --> 17:59.641
--I thought this water tank might do.
--No, no, we can't use steel.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.112
There's too much risk of static.

18:01.268 --> 18:02.851
One spark, the whole thing could blow sky-high.

18:02.855 --> 18:04.843
We don't have time to look for something else.

18:05.598 --> 18:07.832
Well-well, who's going to fill it?

18:09.406 --> 18:11.933
--Well, what do you want to do, draw straws?
--No, I'll do it, you got Bonnie to take care of.

18:11.938 --> 18:12.772
Don't be a martyr.

18:12.887 --> 18:14.133
I've already been irradiated.

18:14.187 --> 18:16.511
--I'm doomed.
--No, you're going to live to be 100, remember?

18:16.517 --> 18:19.501
--Our pacts never work out.
--Let's just do this before we
think about it too much.

18:19.616 --> 18:20.563
Get off the truck, Stanley.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.573
Get off the truck.

18:22.655 --> 18:23.442
Back up.

18:29.378 --> 18:30.121
Hey, Allison.

18:30.327 --> 18:31.590
This place has been a zoo all day.

18:33.785 --> 18:35.770
--Uh, that's $1.69.
--Okay.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.503
--You got the last bag of corn chips.
--I'll give you 20 bucks for them.

18:40.965 --> 18:43.362
--She picked them up first.
--Fine, I'll give you the 20.

18:44.075 --> 18:44.520
Or how about this?

18:44.525 --> 18:45.340
I'm having a party.

18:45.346 --> 18:47.652
If you give me the chips, then I'll invite you.

18:47.897 --> 18:49.530
--I don't even know you.
--So?

18:49.875 --> 18:51.561
It's not like there's anything else to do.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.062
You're awesome.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.560
Come by anytime, it's the big house
at the top of the Pines.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.611
Okay, well, thanks, I guess.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.411
Hi.

19:58.036 --> 19:59.062
Oh, God...

20:00.715 --> 20:02.040
The generator's down!

20:02.286 --> 20:04.751
Somebody call April. Hurry.

20:09.496 --> 20:10.983
We've lost all his machines.

20:10.986 --> 20:13.443
--He's not breathing.
--Okay, I've got to get to the baby

20:13.597 --> 20:15.332
and I only have one hand pump.

20:15.528 --> 20:16.682
You used to be a nurse, Gail.

20:16.686 --> 20:17.802
You'll do fine.

20:40.805 --> 20:41.591
Let's go.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.001
Keep a steady pace.

20:57.018 --> 20:59.322
Uh, guys, we have a problem.

20:59.737 --> 21:00.393
It's stuck.

21:00.397 --> 21:01.871
No, no... Wait, wait, wait,

21:01.956 --> 21:02.171
wait, wait, wait, wait!

21:02.205 --> 21:02.931
Don't feel bad.

21:02.935 --> 21:06.242
--I'll loosen it up for you.
--No. The gas has been sloshing around in there

21:06.246 --> 21:07.113
building up fumes.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.392
--If you force the cap, and it sparks...
--What do you want to do, huh?

21:09.395 --> 21:11.312
Look, with all the static electricity built up

21:11.317 --> 21:13.172
we could blow the thing to kingdom come.

21:21.807 --> 21:22.703
That was dumb.

21:23.417 --> 21:24.703
All right, here, get that to him.

21:24.975 --> 21:25.842
Let's go!

21:27.995 --> 21:29.851
I can't get a heartbeat.

21:38.028 --> 21:38.733
Let's  go!

21:51.296 --> 21:52.473
All right, got it.
Go, Stanley.

22:04.538 --> 22:05.550
How's he doing?

22:07.248 --> 22:10.811
--He was down for about two minutes.
--I need help with the cardiac feed.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.011
See that black switch?
Can you turn that on?

22:23.418 --> 22:24.551
Oh, right.

22:24.686 --> 22:25.710
I invited you.

22:26.028 --> 22:30.210
--Oh, yeah, but, you know I don't...
I don't have to...
--No, forget it. Come in.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.352
Hey, where's April?

22:43.687 --> 22:44.541
Come on.

22:44.908 --> 22:45.763
Come on.

22:54.357 --> 22:55.182
April...

22:56.537 --> 22:58.223
I got 75 gallons of gas.

22:58.618 --> 22:59.590
For the generator.

23:00.537 --> 23:01.421
Thanks.

23:03.117 --> 23:04.462
We got it covered.

23:17.405 --> 23:20.550
Sky, look who invited himself.

23:21.897 --> 23:24.321
Just put it over there.

23:34.798 --> 23:36.712
Why are you such a jerk when
you're with your friends?

23:38.046 --> 23:40.861
--Did I interrupt a lover's spat?
--Stop it, Lisa.

23:43.387 --> 23:43.970
You know what?

23:44.175 --> 23:45.313
I'm gonna go home.

23:45.597 --> 23:47.561
I only came here 'cause you begged me to.

23:51.117 --> 23:53.623
Just... go home.

24:11.576 --> 24:12.553
Victor!

24:14.227 --> 24:15.570
Victor. It's okay.

24:17.046 --> 24:17.873
April!

24:18.506 --> 24:19.252
April!

24:20.528 --> 24:21.223
Vic...

24:26.018 --> 24:26.992
Victor, you said they're coming.

24:27.106 --> 24:28.243
Who's coming?

24:31.318 --> 24:33.162
They need... help.

24:33.488 --> 24:33.833
Who does?

24:33.918 --> 24:34.931
Who needs help?

24:34.977 --> 24:37.883
20 from... Denver.

24:37.938 --> 24:39.291
Where are they, huh?

24:39.326 --> 24:40.391
Where are they?

24:42.965 --> 24:44.861
Lake... A lake?

24:46.778 --> 24:49.993
--Boat. Boat dock.
--A lake with a boat dock?

24:50.258 --> 24:51.172
A lake with a boat dock.

24:51.177 --> 24:52.823
What road is it on, do you remember?

24:54.818 --> 24:55.853
I...

24:56.638 --> 24:59.661
have my... daughter.

25:00.606 --> 25:03.180
--...coming...
--April!

25:29.008 --> 25:29.901
Can I help you?

25:29.908 --> 25:31.272
Hey, turn that down.

25:32.057 --> 25:34.621
--Yeah, we had a complaint that
you're using too much power.
--And?

25:34.788 --> 25:37.862
--And... the party's over.
--You can't do this.

25:37.865 --> 25:40.592
--This is a private home.
--All right, everybody pack it up.

25:42.926 --> 25:46.020
--How much gas you using to run this place, Skylar?
--None of your business.

25:46.026 --> 25:47.943
It's my generator, it's my gas.

25:48.008 --> 25:48.791
Right.

25:50.778 --> 25:51.860
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:55.748 --> 25:57.231
Just go home.

26:00.295 --> 26:02.200
Jimmy. Jimmy!

26:02.795 --> 26:03.483
You got to get over here.

26:03.485 --> 26:04.661
We found Shep's truck.

26:16.686 --> 26:17.472
Bill?

26:18.455 --> 26:19.632
No sign of Shep,

26:20.098 --> 26:21.660
but look what I found inside.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.681
Looks like Victor Miller forgot his wallet.

26:28.868 --> 26:30.751
This is the man you were talking about?

26:31.296 --> 26:33.722
The... The stranger in the hospital?

26:33.816 --> 26:35.293
Yeah. You recognize him?

26:37.058 --> 26:37.913
No.

26:38.715 --> 26:41.323
I just think we should ask him what
he did with your friend Shep.

26:54.127 --> 26:56.523
April, we need to talk to Victor Miller.

26:56.678 --> 26:58.940
--He's unconscious.
--I think you need to wake him up.

26:59.516 --> 27:00.220
No.

27:07.086 --> 27:08.303
Still the same stuff.

27:10.738 --> 27:12.200
Look at all the people running.

27:13.615 --> 27:14.912
What if they come here?

27:22.047 --> 27:22.743
Hey.

27:23.237 --> 27:24.343
You worked a miracle.

27:24.528 --> 27:26.632
Generator's full; we can go three more days.

27:27.406 --> 27:28.661
Great, three days.

27:30.036 --> 27:30.781
Hey.

27:33.215 --> 27:34.701
Everything's going to be all right.

27:38.476 --> 27:40.402
You know, when you say it, I almost believe it.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.492
Eric, you there?

27:47.656 --> 27:48.553
Go, Jimmy.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.752
We found Shep's truck.

27:50.976 --> 27:52.033
Meet us at the clinic.

27:52.466 --> 27:53.491
I'm on my way.

27:54.988 --> 27:55.612
It doesn't matter.

27:55.615 --> 27:57.252
We have got to go look for his family.

27:57.445 --> 27:59.052
Why'd he have Shep's truck?

27:59.056 --> 28:00.242
We need to know what he did with him.

28:00.245 --> 28:04.073
--I know, but we can't just torture a dying man.
--No one is torturing anyone.

28:04.076 --> 28:06.042
We could give him a shot of adrenaline.

28:06.067 --> 28:08.960
--It'll wake him up enough to question him.
--He's dying of third degree burns.

28:09.008 --> 28:11.100
--It'll be like waking him up on fire.
--Uh...

28:12.396 --> 28:14.321
Our people are dying out there.

28:14.547 --> 28:16.083
Shep may already be dead.

28:16.315 --> 28:19.221
--We need to protect ourselves, Jake.
--We need to protect ourselves from this.

28:19.228 --> 28:22.122
Jake, Shep, he's one of us.

28:22.347 --> 28:26.522
--We need to find out what this guy did to him.
--Hey, he is going to die, anyway.

28:27.146 --> 28:29.023
But he could save some people's lives.

28:33.717 --> 28:34.462
Eric.

28:42.007 --> 28:45.502
--I'd like to do this myself.
--No, I'm not leaving him.

28:46.837 --> 28:47.650
Okay.

28:52.605 --> 28:53.810
What's going on in there?

28:54.755 --> 28:57.950
--They're asking him a few questions.
--Like hell they will. That's my patient.

28:58.855 --> 29:00.860
--Let go of me.
--We need information.

29:01.488 --> 29:02.090
You have no right.

29:02.206 --> 29:05.622
--He could be a murderer.
--And that gives you the power
to do anything that you want?

29:05.627 --> 29:06.600
Yes.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.243
Yes.

29:17.317 --> 29:20.480
Victor, it's going to be okay.
We'll make this quick, all right?

29:20.865 --> 29:21.653
Hey.

29:24.205 --> 29:25.733
The car you drove here--

29:26.907 --> 29:28.431
did someone give it to you?

29:28.907 --> 29:30.202
No, no.

29:30.667 --> 29:31.440
It was...

29:31.796 --> 29:33.862
It was... on the side...

29:33.937 --> 29:34.931
of the road.

29:34.937 --> 29:37.973
Okay. It... It was... running.

29:37.975 --> 29:39.603
Okay, okay.

29:39.925 --> 29:43.962
--But was there anybody in it?
--No.

29:46.155 --> 29:48.780
I had... to help them.

29:50.587 --> 29:51.451
Where are they?

29:51.856 --> 29:54.181
--Do you remember anything else about the lake?
--It burns.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.311
--Was it off a dirt road?
--It burns.

29:56.318 --> 29:59.573
--He needs morphine.
--Was your daughter at Bass Lake?

29:59.758 --> 30:02.841
--Y-Yes.
--He needs morphine, Jake.
--Please, please.

30:06.255 --> 30:07.513
Hey. Hey!

30:09.155 --> 30:13.422
We said families only, hmm?

30:14.715 --> 30:20.242
--Why? Why did you go back to Denver?
--I...

30:21.348 --> 30:25.611
--I couldn't let them die.
--It was a mistake, Vic,

30:25.847 --> 30:29.100
--because now we are a man down.
--No. Some... some...

30:29.807 --> 30:32.743
S-Someone... Someone flipped.

30:33.056 --> 30:34.062
A traitor.

30:34.065 --> 30:38.713
There's...a tra... traitor.

30:41.096 --> 30:42.550
Do you know who it was?

30:48.308 --> 30:50.061
Come on, man, tell me.

30:51.187 --> 30:52.983
--Vic, who was it?
--I...

30:52.988 --> 30:53.611
Tell me.

30:53.688 --> 30:57.030
Do you know who it was?

30:59.355 --> 31:01.200
You... know.

31:19.888 --> 31:21.610
He's gone.

31:40.706 --> 31:41.850
We had to do it.

31:52.556 --> 31:54.791
I thought you were going to a party, hon.

31:57.818 --> 31:59.310
You're worth ten of her.

31:59.827 --> 32:02.692
--Ten of who?
--Skylar Stevens.

32:04.365 --> 32:06.282
--She's not a bad person.
--Hmm.

32:08.907 --> 32:10.201
We're not like them.

32:11.316 --> 32:13.693
They can be nice sometimes, but

32:13.807 --> 32:15.191
don't be fooled.

32:17.427 --> 32:18.802
That's what my mom used to say.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.981
Well, she was a smart lady.

32:43.946 --> 32:44.803
You scared?

32:48.497 --> 32:50.462
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong

32:52.097 --> 32:54.130
waiting for my old man to come home.

33:04.737 --> 33:06.290
Baby, what you did today--

33:08.695 --> 33:11.080
that wasn't just you going to a party.

33:11.937 --> 33:12.400
It wasn't.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.643
You put your mother,

33:15.135 --> 33:16.003
your brother,

33:17.938 --> 33:19.551
all of us at risk.

33:20.906 --> 33:22.030
Do you hear?

33:27.165 --> 33:29.281
And if you pull something like this again

33:31.357 --> 33:34.921
girl, you have no idea how scared you'll be.

34:04.558 --> 34:06.041
I need a few volunteers.

34:08.137 --> 34:10.362
There's a group of people just outside of town.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.972
No way, man! It's too dangerous out there!

34:13.197 --> 34:14.210
They're at Bass Lake.

34:15.337 --> 34:16.552
They may have radiation sickness.

34:16.556 --> 34:18.382
We need to bring them here
get them to the clinic

34:18.387 --> 34:19.429
before it's too late.

34:19.846 --> 34:21.931
--Turn it back on!
--We've seen it.

34:22.156 --> 34:23.402
We've seen it 100 times.

34:23.516 --> 34:26.411
A man just died in our clinic. Our clinic!

34:28.248 --> 34:30.271
He was traveling with his daughter

34:31.176 --> 34:32.661
and about 20 other people.

34:34.594 --> 34:40.081
All right, it could have been
Shep or Gray or any of us.

34:42.237 --> 34:43.330
They need our help.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.150
Are we going to help them?

34:46.498 --> 34:51.081
Or are we just going to sit here watching
the same three images over and over?

35:03.197 --> 35:04.050
Jake?

35:05.426 --> 35:07.902
I'll donate gas if you need
to fill your car to get them.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.763
--Thank you, Mary.
--I'll go with you.

35:12.595 --> 35:13.572
Thank you.

35:16.128 --> 35:17.341
Anybody else?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.461
--I'll go with you, Jake. I'll go.
--Let's go.

35:21.928 --> 35:24.130
--Yeah, me, too.
--Thank you.

36:09.255 --> 36:11.922
Earlier today, we buried 20 people--

36:12.837 --> 36:14.061
refugees from Denver.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.523
People we didn't know,

36:16.615 --> 36:20.642
but were prepared to welcome into our town.

36:21.566 --> 36:24.710
Unfortunately, they died of radiation poisoning

36:24.718 --> 36:25.962
before we could reach them.

36:27.335 --> 36:28.940
For those people from Denver,

36:29.468 --> 36:30.671
and for our own people,

36:31.346 --> 36:33.661
for Sheriff Dawes and Deputy Riley

36:35.208 --> 36:37.553
for Deputy Conner and Deputy Salem...

36:41.255 --> 36:44.231
...for people out there
somewhere we know nothing about

36:44.235 --> 36:47.721
who might be suffering and dying right now--

36:47.875 --> 36:50.301
I ask that we take a moment of silence.

36:57.068 --> 36:58.670
If you've lost a loved one,

36:58.697 --> 36:59.940
would you please stand?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.822
If someone you love is missing,

37:10.826 --> 37:12.800
would you join those standing?

37:24.386 --> 37:30.443
We stand because we know
that every life matters.

37:32.457 --> 37:35.552
We have to fight for every life,

37:36.888 --> 37:39.480
even when it seems hopeless,

37:41.018 --> 37:42.632
even when we're afraid,

37:44.326 --> 37:48.751
because the battle ahead
isn't just for our survival

37:53.145 --> 37:54.941
it's for our humanity.

38:18.595 --> 38:20.041
I think I'm going to be okay.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.921
Jake. Hi.

38:26.746 --> 38:29.722
You're a good man for trying
to help someone you didn't even know.

39:26.655 --> 39:30.742
--Hey, you thirsty again?
--No. Couldn't sleep.

39:38.137 --> 39:41.622
--Where did you go to school, Sam?
--Crow Island.

39:50.645 --> 39:53.313
--Who is your dad?
--You.

39:55.376 --> 39:58.671
--Who loves you more than anything in the world?
--You.

40:00.825 --> 40:01.961
And, Sam,

40:02.867 --> 40:08.122
--who is always going to take care of you?
--Mommy.
