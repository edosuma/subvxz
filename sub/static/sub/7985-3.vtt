02:34.488 --> 02:37.491
Unfortunately...

02:37.491 --> 02:40.327
we have to talk

02:40.327 --> 02:43.296
We did not
have a winner

02:43.296 --> 02:45.065

02:45.065 --> 02:46.600
Not in...

Nia's division, nor in...

02:49.302 --> 02:51.038
Kendall and
Mackenzie's division.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.639
And our group

02:52.639 --> 02:53.640
didn't win the overall.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.310
<i>Now, I think</i>
<i>there's one difference.</i>

02:57.310 --> 02:58.779
Maddie hears things

02:58.779 --> 03:01.348
in the music that
the rest of you don't hear.

03:01.348 --> 03:05.519

03:18.298 --> 03:19.733
...Kendall.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.502

<i>You can be a pretty girl</i>
<i>all day long,</i>

you're not doing.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.116
ABBY LEE: <i>Kendall K</i>
<i>is supposed to be a star.</i>

03:36.116 --> 03:37.984
She's supposed to wear 'em out.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.654
She only wore <i>me</i> out
because she didn't behave.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.823
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>she's at the bottom.</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:44.891
All right, next...

03:44.891 --> 03:47.027
on the pyramid...

03:47.027 --> 03:48.829
Nia.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.731
Solo artist.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.933
Have two videos
out there.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.068
Why are you down there?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.074
'Cause you were second.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.375
Next...

04:02.375 --> 04:03.977
we would have Mackenzie.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.179
Mackenzie...

04:06.179 --> 04:08.315
same thing‐‐
you're letting...

04:08.315 --> 04:09.816
people beat you.

04:09.816 --> 04:10.917
So...

04:10.917 --> 04:13.920
<i>they're beating Mack Z.</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:16.189
They're beating
Maddie's little sister.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.725
For them,
it's a big deal.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.194
It needs to be a bigger deal
for you, too.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.462
Next...

04:22.462 --> 04:24.331
Brynn.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.199
I didn't see a
stellar performance.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.501
I didn't see

04:27.501 --> 04:28.869
any mistakes.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.438
You were just...
middle of the road.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.173
Next on the
pyramid...

04:33.173 --> 04:35.075
JoJo.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.344

04:37.344 --> 04:40.714

<i>rallied behind the character</i>

04:42.082 --> 04:43.350
All right, at the top

04:43.350 --> 04:45.018

04:46.520 --> 04:47.687

Kalani!

As far as somebody helping out

05:10.644 --> 05:13.213
<i>with the choreography</i>
<i>and figuring it out,</i>

05:13.213 --> 05:15.715
<i>it would have to be Kalani.</i>

05:15.715 --> 05:18.885
We are attending

05:18.885 --> 05:21.855
Devotion 2 Dance Competition.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.023
They're devoted
to dance.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.492
You're gonna be devoted to dance
this entire week.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.763
All right, now...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.598
Kendall, I
promised a solo

05:31.598 --> 05:34.000
to our highest‐scoring soloist.
It's you.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.772
And the name of
your routine is

05:38.772 --> 05:41.675
"All Eyes Are on Me."

05:41.675 --> 05:44.211
The last thing
I said to you

05:44.211 --> 05:46.580
last week at the
competition was about

05:46.580 --> 05:48.582
paying attention
to the lyrics in the song.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.417
But you got on stage

05:50.417 --> 05:51.685
and you placed third.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.520
Well, I think the whole dance
started going downhill

05:53.520 --> 05:55.155
when Kendall had
a meltdown backstage

05:55.155 --> 05:56.656
about not wanting
to wear the makeup.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.992
And not wanting to do
what she was given.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.829
JILL:
Okay. Shh. Okay.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.297
JILL: She did exactly
what she was given

06:04.297 --> 06:06.466
without latex on her face.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.337
All right.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.839
The next solo

06:12.839 --> 06:13.974
is going to JoJo.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.809
But, uh,

06:15.809 --> 06:17.444
JoJo...

06:17.444 --> 06:19.045
no bow‐bow.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.749
Coming out today.
Staying out the entire week.

06:22.749 --> 06:27.287
You are doing a hip‐hop
dance entitled...

06:27.287 --> 06:30.924
"I'll Show You the Dark Side."

06:30.924 --> 06:32.692
OTHERS:
Ooh...!

06:32.692 --> 06:34.294
Now, Kendall

06:34.294 --> 06:36.296
couldn't take anybody
to the dark side.

06:36.296 --> 06:40.033
She did not get the
judges to feel the pain

06:40.033 --> 06:41.534
and the agony that

06:41.534 --> 06:43.203
the artist was
singing about.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.105
She didn't get
that story across.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.139
I will.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.140
JESSALYNN:
<i>Stars don't have</i>

06:47.140 --> 06:48.174
<i>meltdowns about makeup.</i>

06:48.174 --> 06:49.910
The whole reason
we're in L. A. is

06:49.910 --> 06:51.845
<i>because JoJo can do characters</i>
<i>better than anyone else</i>

06:51.845 --> 06:53.546
<i>on this team‐‐</i>
<i>better than Brynn,</i>

06:53.546 --> 06:55.115
better than Maddie, and...

06:55.115 --> 06:57.384
<i>certainly better</i>
<i>than Kendall K.</i>

06:57.384 --> 06:59.552
All right, moving
right along.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.721
Now, I have the group routine.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.390
Miss Gianna's not
here this week.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.393
She's back at the
studio in Pittsburgh.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.562
So I thought I'd take
this opportunity to do...

07:09.562 --> 07:12.499
something that I wouldn't
use her to assist me on.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.136
And that would be
a hip‐hop number.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.071
(cheering, whooping)

07:18.071 --> 07:20.073
(yelling):
So...

07:20.073 --> 07:21.408
the group routine

07:21.408 --> 07:22.909
is "Straight Outta Pittsburgh."

07:22.909 --> 07:24.444

what she's made of.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.996
The reason I'm doing
this solo for her

16:36.996 --> 16:39.398
<i>is because she'll do anything.</i>

16:39.398 --> 16:40.700
And Kendall
doesn't do that.
Yeah.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.767
Kendall's closed

16:41.767 --> 16:43.169
<i>and nobody gets to her.</i>

16:43.169 --> 16:45.037
<i>So, JoJo is</i>

16:45.037 --> 16:46.672
"I'll Show You
the Dark Side,"

16:46.672 --> 16:47.773
<i>'cause Kendall</i>
<i>couldn't do that.</i>

16:47.773 --> 16:50.109
Okay, let's go.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.277
JoJo's really
killing it in there.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.946
Good. She's so excited.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.249
Yeah, I don't see JoJo crying
when they get her all made‐up.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.086
ASHLEE:
Abby, I was just curious

17:00.086 --> 17:01.687
as to why Kendall
has a solo

17:01.687 --> 17:03.823
and not Brynn,
when she did pretty well

17:03.823 --> 17:05.157
the first week
that we came.
She did great.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.193
ASHLEE: I know she really
wants another one.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.661
All right. Well, she's in there
learning one now.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.829
Maybe she'll do it better
than Kendall.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.863
<i>She can do this one.</i>

17:10.863 --> 17:12.064
Okay.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.469
All right, let's
see what we have!

17:16.469 --> 17:18.471
JILL:
<i>I can't stand Ashlee</i>

17:18.471 --> 17:20.339
<i>thinking Brynn</i>
<i>is the next Maddie.</i>

17:20.339 --> 17:23.342
<i>Kendall K has been groomed</i>
<i>to be the next star.</i>

17:23.342 --> 17:25.211
<i>There's a pecking order here</i>
<i>at the ALDC,</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:27.547
and, sister,
you're on the bottom.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.550
<i>I'm not gonna sit here and</i>
<i>let you take away everything</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:32.351
<i>we've worked for.</i>

17:32.351 --> 17:33.686
Not today, Satan.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.321
<i>I think Brynn</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:37.557
should be dancing
behind Kendall, not...

17:37.557 --> 17:39.559
<i>in her way. Just sayin'.</i>
ASHLEE:
<i>I think she thinks</i>

17:39.559 --> 17:41.894
<i>she's off to the side,</i>
<i>honestly.</i>
JILL: <i>Well...</i>

17:41.894 --> 17:44.430
She's dancing up
by the teacher.
I think she just thinks

17:44.430 --> 17:46.198
she's off to the side.
She should be
in the back of Kendall.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.200
JILL: <i>Look. Here goes Kendall.</i>
<i>Brynn's right in front of her.</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:49.502
JESSALYNN: <i>Look at her!</i>

17:49.502 --> 17:50.503
<i>Why doesn't she just move</i>
<i>and let Kendall,</i>

17:50.503 --> 17:51.504
like, dance?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.172
Go sit down
where Kendall sat.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.041
It's wrong.
JESSALYNN:
Look at what Nia's doing.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.709
<i>Nia's off in the corner.</i>

17:56.709 --> 17:58.911
<i>Nia can't even see herself</i>
<i>in the mirror.</i>

17:58.911 --> 18:00.112
ASHLEE:
<i>Is Abby</i>

18:00.112 --> 18:01.781
and the choreographer
both in there?
Yes.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.317
If there was a problem, they
would tell her, don't you think?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.018
I think so.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.353
I think, if Brynn

18:07.353 --> 18:09.288
had a brain in her head,
she would know to back off.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.690
Do not call my child stupid!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.124
If she had a brain
in her head...
I'm not

18:12.124 --> 18:13.526
gonna sit here and listen to you
... she would sit back.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.994
bash my kid!

18:14.994 --> 18:16.529
Bye!

18:18.531 --> 18:20.866
I am getting no end of hate,

18:20.866 --> 18:24.203
because Brynn is in the front,
instead of being in the back.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.105
If they want
her to move,

18:26.105 --> 18:27.840
you guys would tell her.
Am I right?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.209
That's right.
Thank you very much.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.545
Abby, this is Kendall's
solo, not Brynn's.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.546
Am I right?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.214
(smacks lips)

18:36.582 --> 18:38.184
ABBY LEE: Yes.
JILL: Okay. So why

18:38.184 --> 18:41.087
is Brynn on Kendall's side,
in her way,

18:41.087 --> 18:43.789
when she's trying to dance?
Making a mockery of her.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.858
Jill, she wasn't making
a mockery of anyone.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.027
That's very vindictive.
She wasn't doing that.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.395
JILL: Okay, wait.
I‐I just want

18:49.395 --> 18:50.563
to get this straight.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.764
Do you want Brynn
to do this solo?
Jill...

18:51.764 --> 18:53.466
You're gonna stick up for Brynn.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.600
I'm sticking up for the child

18:54.600 --> 18:55.801
that's in the room
that's helping.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.436
Are you kidding me?
You never trained

18:57.436 --> 18:59.472
that kid!
You never taught her

18:59.472 --> 19:01.440
a (bleep) thing!

19:01.440 --> 19:03.442
Why can't Kendall just open
her own mouth and say,

19:03.442 --> 19:05.277
"You're in my way. Move"?
Why can't Brynn

19:05.277 --> 19:07.647
have a brain
and sit in the back?!

19:08.881 --> 19:10.850
ASHLEE: <i>The real reason</i>
<i>that Jill is angry</i>

19:10.850 --> 19:13.819
is that Kendall has invested
five years into this team

19:13.819 --> 19:15.888
and doesn't have a whole lot
to show for it.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.857
<i>And Jill feels</i>
<i>like Brynn coming here</i>

19:17.857 --> 19:19.458
is gonna take away from Kendall.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.794
The reality is maybe
Kendall already had her shot.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.196
JILL: Brynn, this has
nothing to do with you.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.297
But you need to learn,

19:25.297 --> 19:26.532
when the kids are learning
their solos,

19:26.532 --> 19:27.867
you stay out of their way.
I know,

19:27.867 --> 19:29.368
but I wasn't dancing
in front of her.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.737
Honey, don't talk back to
a grown‐up; just say, "Okay,

19:31.737 --> 19:33.039
I'll stay out
of her way."

19:33.039 --> 19:34.707
Got it?
Are you guys yelling
at Brynn?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.008
JESSALYNN:
No!

19:36.008 --> 19:36.842
Are you yelling at Brynn?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.244
JILL: Go ask

19:38.244 --> 19:40.179
your kid what I said!

19:42.581 --> 19:45.384
ASHLEE: <i>Who was yelling at you?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

19:45.384 --> 19:47.053
Why? What did she say?
Because she said

19:47.053 --> 19:49.255
I was dancing in front
of Kendall and I wasn't.
I know.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.791
She said you don't talk back
to a grown‐up and I wasn't even

19:51.791 --> 19:53.559
dancing in front of her.
I know.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.891
that she has this studio

honestly couldn't figure out
It... No, no.

23:44.857 --> 23:48.661

My anger started when Brynn
was in Kendall's way.

23:48.661 --> 23:52.431
Then it escalated when Abby
was sticking up for Brynn.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.401

It's not.

That's where
you're wrong.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.404
It's not. It's not a threat.

42:07.258 --> 42:08.426
They're all crazy.

42:08.426 --> 42:12.096
JILL: She needs to shut
her (bleep) mouth!

42:12.096 --> 42:13.398
MELISSA: I'm gonna punch her
in the (bleep) face.

42:13.398 --> 42:14.966
Abby's not here today.

42:14.966 --> 42:17.001
<i>Regardless of anything else</i>
<i>that's going on,</i>

42:17.001 --> 42:18.736
<i>whatever's happening,</i>

42:18.736 --> 42:20.538
you need to do this
for yourselves.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.174
In fourth place...

42:23.174 --> 42:24.776
What?!
