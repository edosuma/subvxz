00:12.993 --> 00:14.552
I am a beauty therapist.

00:14.553 --> 00:16.512
Hi. Lyudmilla?

00:16.513 --> 00:18.352
We go with these men now.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.762
I need you to meet me
in Prague next week.

00:22.765 --> 00:24.992
I'm having issues with the Czechs.

00:24.993 --> 00:27.552
I agreed to move your capital for you.

00:27.553 --> 00:29.112
That's it.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.672
This man Reznik knows
nothing about finance,

00:31.673 --> 00:33.992
but there are others around him who do.

00:33.995 --> 00:36.275
Karel Benes. Nice to meet you.

00:37.313 --> 00:40.992
You're someone we'd be very
happy to do business with.

00:40.993 --> 00:42.072
Agh!

00:49.873 --> 00:50.993
I'll take her.

00:54.753 --> 00:56.304
Reznik is dead.

00:58.113 --> 00:59.921
This is how it works, I'm afraid.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.233
That's all you had to say.

04:46.760 --> 04:54.195

05:04.953 --> 05:05.993
Agh!

05:11.353 --> 05:12.952
OK.

05:12.953 --> 05:17.112
How is the feeling in your left arm?

05:17.113 --> 05:19.432
- Better.
- OK.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.912
And your accident was ten weeks ago?

05:21.913 --> 05:23.072
Yes.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.632
Now, I'm going to
give you some exercises

05:25.633 --> 05:27.382
to help strengthen the muscles.

05:27.385 --> 05:29.352
So, if I make my hand into a fist...

05:29.353 --> 05:32.122
I know your father's not
interested in counselling...

05:32.125 --> 05:34.272
He has his family around him.

05:34.273 --> 05:35.553
We're all very close.

05:37.073 --> 05:39.257
I understand, but it's important

05:39.260 --> 05:41.624
that we get to the root
cause of his depression.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.033
He's living in a foreign
country, he's lost his brother.

05:46.993 --> 05:50.473
We appreciate the care he's had,
but we can look after him, too.

06:01.353 --> 06:03.472
It got dark at three
and I was working late

06:03.473 --> 06:05.072
so I never got to see the city.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.200
That's a pity. It's very beautiful.

06:07.203 --> 06:08.152
I know!

06:08.153 --> 06:11.072
I did take a stroll around
the Royal Palace in the snow.

06:11.073 --> 06:13.112
Excuse me, Miss Harper?

06:13.113 --> 06:14.552
Yes?

06:14.553 --> 06:16.512
I'm sorry to interrupt.

06:16.513 --> 06:19.193
I was at Business School
with Miss Harper's partner.

06:20.393 --> 06:22.152
I'm Antonio Mendez.

06:22.153 --> 06:23.512
Britt Andersson.

06:23.515 --> 06:24.679
- Nice meeting you.
- Ja.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.992
You were at Harvard with Alex?

06:27.993 --> 06:29.352
A long time ago!

06:29.353 --> 06:31.673
- Excuse me.
- It was lovely to meet you.

06:32.713 --> 06:34.472
- I'm sorry...
- No.

06:34.473 --> 06:37.192
Um... Well, what do you do now?

06:37.193 --> 06:40.032
I own a fishing fleet.
That's why I'm here.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.312
Are you based in London?

06:41.313 --> 06:44.992
No, I'm mostly between
Mexico City and San Diego,

06:44.993 --> 06:47.192
but I visit Europe a lot.

06:47.193 --> 06:51.512
I'm trying to convince Alex to come
and see me in the South of France.

06:51.513 --> 06:54.752
I'm thinking of investing
some money in his fund.

06:54.753 --> 06:57.233
It might be too small
for him to take seriously!

07:04.233 --> 07:05.793
You're back late.

07:07.351 --> 07:09.152
I thought you were going to be an hour.

07:09.153 --> 07:11.552
It was pretty fun, for an embassy party.

07:11.553 --> 07:14.072
I met your friend, Antonio Mendez.

07:14.073 --> 07:17.153
You didn't tell me he invited
you to the South of France.

07:18.364 --> 07:20.084
He asked me, too.

07:23.914 --> 07:25.726
Don't worry. I won't come.

07:31.433 --> 07:32.472
Antonio?

07:32.473 --> 07:35.032
Yeah. How come you never
mentioned him before?

07:35.033 --> 07:37.109
He was very complimentary about you.

07:39.313 --> 07:41.312
What was he doing at
the Norwegian embassy?

07:41.313 --> 07:42.952
Trying to persuade the ambassador

07:42.953 --> 07:44.473
to give him a fishing licence.

07:45.793 --> 07:47.672
What did he say about me?

07:47.673 --> 07:51.992
He said he voted you most
likely to succeed at Harvard.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.673
Are you going to say yes?

07:54.913 --> 07:56.352
To what?

07:56.353 --> 07:57.793
His money!

08:02.073 --> 08:03.833
I'm not sure yet.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.138
There he is.

08:14.141 --> 08:15.181
Where?

08:18.433 --> 08:19.592
Gosh.

08:19.593 --> 08:21.712
Well, he doesn't look like that now...

08:21.713 --> 08:23.913
Looks like they got the wrong photo.

08:27.033 --> 08:28.992
The quarterly report's
gone out on the EM,

08:28.993 --> 08:32.073
but you still haven't shown me
anything from the Global Fund.

08:38.073 --> 08:40.710
Sorry, I've just been really swamped.

08:42.472 --> 08:45.392
Jake also wants to replace Tobe Miller.

08:45.393 --> 08:46.512
Who?

08:46.513 --> 08:48.952
The heavy metal guy.

08:48.953 --> 08:51.112
The guy who does our IT.

08:51.115 --> 08:54.635
Jake thinks he may have been
snooping inside the trading system.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.992
Well, can't Jake deal with it?

08:57.993 --> 09:00.353
He needs your approval to let him go.

09:03.473 --> 09:05.793
Why don't I come back when
you've cleared your head?

09:07.993 --> 09:09.153
Sorry.

09:16.753 --> 09:17.792
Yep.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.793
I have Antonio Mendez on line one.

09:24.593 --> 09:25.792
Can you take his number?

09:25.793 --> 09:27.193
Tell him I'll give him a call back.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.872
Mr. Mendez?

09:34.873 --> 09:36.512
Hola.

09:36.513 --> 09:37.993
Alex Godman.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.833
Apparently we were at Harvard together.

09:43.073 --> 09:44.832
What can I do for you?

09:44.833 --> 09:47.312
I'm interested in your Global Fund.

09:47.313 --> 09:48.993
I was hoping we could meet.

09:53.972 --> 09:56.932
All you had to do was make an
appointment with my secretary.

09:58.753 --> 10:00.232
I was thinking about your security.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.792
Perhaps you should have done the same

10:01.793 --> 10:03.472
when you visited Prague with Mr. Kleiman.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.406
Mr. Kleiman is a client.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.392
You've accepted a great
deal of money from him.

10:09.393 --> 10:11.673
I assume you know where it comes from.

10:14.633 --> 10:17.032
We carried out all the necessary checks.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.672
So, if the authorities took
a look at your Global Fund,

10:19.673 --> 10:20.793
they'd find nothing?

10:23.953 --> 10:25.192
Don't worry.

10:25.193 --> 10:26.713
I'm an old friend, remember.

10:27.873 --> 10:31.512
Nobody needs to know about this,
not even Mr. Kleiman.

10:31.513 --> 10:33.233
When would you like to meet?

10:34.273 --> 10:35.752
Whenever's convenient.

10:35.753 --> 10:37.712
Rebecca may have told
you I'm staying in Antibes

10:37.713 --> 10:38.873
in the South of France.

10:41.913 --> 10:45.632
She isn't familiar with the Global
Fund, or Mr. Kleiman.

10:45.633 --> 10:49.552
It would be more discreet if
you came to visit me as a couple.

10:49.553 --> 10:51.752
Perhaps if she had
accompanied you to Prague

10:51.753 --> 10:54.952
you might not have come to my
attention in the first place.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.273
I'm open to a meeting,
but it has to be on my own.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.312
I'll book your flights for this weekend.

11:00.313 --> 11:02.192
You'll stay in a hotel near my villa

11:02.193 --> 11:04.273
and spend a wonderful weekend together.

12:12.913 --> 12:14.073
Ilya...

13:30.033 --> 13:32.352
You want to come to the South of France?

13:32.353 --> 13:33.873
You decided to go!

13:36.673 --> 13:38.433
I'll see what he has to offer.

13:40.873 --> 13:44.032
Well, Sydney's supposed
to be coming to town...

13:44.033 --> 13:45.553
We can go on a weekend.

13:48.473 --> 13:52.512
Hopefully it'll just be a
couple of meetings with Antonio,

13:52.513 --> 13:56.192
you and I can spend the
rest of the time together.

13:56.193 --> 13:58.390
Sure. Why not?

14:09.593 --> 14:12.912
I want to open a top
class casino ship in Eilat

14:12.913 --> 14:16.070
instead of the second
rate places we have now.

14:17.593 --> 14:20.952
Even in Beirut they
have a super casino -

14:20.953 --> 14:23.906
restaurants, entertainment, cabarets...

14:24.553 --> 14:28.559
It generates nearly
50 million a year, net.

14:28.562 --> 14:33.832
That's with a 15% tax on
revenue and 30% tax on profits.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.272
The Prime Minister
understands larger casino

14:36.273 --> 14:37.872
will help the local economy,

14:37.873 --> 14:41.152
but he worries about
gambling addiction and crime.

14:41.153 --> 14:43.632
Crime is the last thing
he needs to worry about

14:43.633 --> 14:47.072
as long as we regulate
the casinos properly.

14:47.073 --> 14:49.592
Addiction, there's
nothing I can do about...

14:49.593 --> 14:51.474
unfortunately!

14:51.477 --> 14:52.797
Please.

14:55.073 --> 14:59.992
You flirt discreetly, but there's
never any suggestion of sex.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.992
If they make advances, you're polite,

15:04.993 --> 15:08.592
but you let them know you're
not one of those girls.

15:08.593 --> 15:12.098
You come from a good family,
you have a private income,

15:12.101 --> 15:15.992
and you're only interested
in talking to them...

15:15.993 --> 15:17.976
because they're fascinating.

15:19.113 --> 15:22.432
Once they realise you're not
interested in their looks,

15:22.433 --> 15:24.673
they'll try to impress
you with their minds.

15:27.033 --> 15:30.632
What Mr. Kleiman wants to know

15:30.633 --> 15:33.484
is how they plan to negotiate,

15:33.487 --> 15:35.606
how high they're willing to go.

15:35.609 --> 15:37.832
Yeah! Do that again! Yeah!

15:37.833 --> 15:41.032
You're interested in going
to business school in America.

15:41.033 --> 15:42.835
Ask their advice.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.207
Let them tell you how clever they are...

15:47.433 --> 15:49.195
and remember everything...

15:50.753 --> 15:52.953
even what you don't understand.

16:48.113 --> 16:49.913
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

17:08.673 --> 17:09.873
Wow.

17:24.313 --> 17:26.512
Antonio!

17:30.713 --> 17:32.793
- Hi!
- So glad you're here.

17:38.553 --> 17:41.112
It's good to see you, my friend.

17:41.113 --> 17:43.312
You didn't have to meet us.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.553
You came all this way,
it's the least I could do.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.945
How was your flight?

17:47.948 --> 17:49.752
Nice and short.

17:49.753 --> 17:51.112
Good.

17:51.113 --> 17:54.072
And hotel's not bad. Is this OK?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.512
It's perfect.

17:56.953 --> 17:59.552
I'm having a few friends over
for dinner at the villa tonight.

17:59.553 --> 18:01.112
You're welcome to join us.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.153
That'd be great.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.393
Why don't I check in
for you while you decide?

18:09.394 --> 18:10.914
I just need your passports.

18:14.073 --> 18:15.750
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:20.492 --> 18:22.073
Thanks.

18:54.993 --> 18:56.033
Da.

19:02.753 --> 19:03.793
Da.

19:07.673 --> 19:08.713
Katya.

22:38.473 --> 22:40.192
Hi.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.353
Thank you.

22:44.313 --> 22:46.633
- Thank you.
- Rebecca, come see the view.

23:08.196 --> 23:10.036
Were you in the same year at Harvard?

23:14.313 --> 23:16.032
Yes.

23:16.033 --> 23:18.713
I'm a little older than Alex,
but I was a late bloomer.

23:19.753 --> 23:23.152
I was the Mexican foreigner,
he was the Russian foreigner,

23:23.153 --> 23:24.952
so we became allies.

23:24.953 --> 23:26.507
Why were you a late bloomer?

23:28.833 --> 23:30.843
I came to America as an illegal.

23:31.673 --> 23:34.512
It took me five years to get my papers.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.912
You were smuggled in?

23:35.913 --> 23:37.192
By boat.

23:37.193 --> 23:38.912
We call them pangas...

23:38.913 --> 23:40.392
and mine was a small one.

23:40.393 --> 23:42.032
Only 40 people.

23:42.033 --> 23:44.832
We landed at Encinitas, near San Diego.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.952
That's where I lived my
first five years in the US,

23:46.953 --> 23:48.992
and that's where I live now.

23:48.993 --> 23:51.781
Well, that has a nice circularity.

23:51.784 --> 23:53.530
It's good business, too.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.312
The one thing I learnt
on my boat journey

23:56.313 --> 23:59.912
is America is one big coastline.

23:59.913 --> 24:03.633
You conquer the sea, you have
a lot of business to yourself.

24:08.273 --> 24:10.232
And you,

24:10.233 --> 24:12.124
how did the two of you meet?

24:13.316 --> 24:16.835
We were both interns
at Goldman in New York.

24:16.838 --> 24:19.953
I was nervous as hell, and he
looked like he was born to it.

24:21.351 --> 24:23.632
And was it love at first sight?

24:23.635 --> 24:27.472
No, I loathed him the
minute I laid eyes on him.

24:27.473 --> 24:30.594
He was rich, handsome, entitled.

24:33.335 --> 24:34.793
How did you win her round?

24:38.612 --> 24:40.052
I don't scare easily.

24:55.513 --> 24:57.312
How much is that?

24:57.313 --> 25:00.513
100 euros, 20 minutes. 200, one hour.

25:02.353 --> 25:03.752
That's too much!

25:03.753 --> 25:06.472
Come on. We're Russians,
we're not Americans.

25:06.473 --> 25:08.202
Take 100 for one hour.

25:11.075 --> 25:12.394
- OK.
- Good.

25:28.793 --> 25:30.792
I'm taking the boat out tomorrow.

25:30.793 --> 25:33.272
It's going to be perfect
weather, apparently.

25:33.273 --> 25:35.792
We could picnic near the
Porquerolles, have a swim,

25:35.793 --> 25:37.513
and finally get round to business.

25:41.633 --> 25:42.793
Or not.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.851
Night. Thank you again.

26:45.891 --> 26:49.468
My God, I haven't had
headspin like this in years.

26:52.993 --> 26:54.193
Close your eyes.

26:55.633 --> 26:57.554
That makes it worse.

27:00.193 --> 27:01.833
How's the weather for tomorrow?

27:03.153 --> 27:04.968
Perfect, like he said.

27:05.873 --> 27:07.992
I'm sorry.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.476
This is meant to be a dirty weekend.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.192
It's OK.

27:13.193 --> 27:15.113
I'm happy with an undirty weekend.

29:23.873 --> 29:25.393
Hi, Papa.

29:34.833 --> 29:37.513
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Godman.

30:07.779 --> 30:09.938
Maybe we should go.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.800
It finishes in five minutes.

30:56.633 --> 30:57.952
Katya.

30:57.953 --> 30:59.472
Papa?

30:59.473 --> 31:01.960
I need to speak with your mother alone.

31:20.593 --> 31:21.993
Thank you, Joseph.

31:25.153 --> 31:27.992
You were very charming tonight, my dear.

31:27.993 --> 31:29.033
Thank you.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.792
Can you take her home, please, Joseph?

31:32.793 --> 31:33.833
I'll be fine.

31:38.753 --> 31:39.913
Good night.

31:56.993 --> 31:58.468
You can smoke if you like.

32:00.132 --> 32:01.353
I don't smoke.

32:04.353 --> 32:06.632
Where in Russia are you from?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.392
Outside Moscow.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.952
You won't know it.

32:09.953 --> 32:11.433
I was born in Moscow.

32:13.793 --> 32:14.999
Kapotnya.

32:17.033 --> 32:18.593
You're right. I don't know it.

32:23.433 --> 32:24.741
When did you leave?

32:25.953 --> 32:28.192
92.

32:28.193 --> 32:29.633
When I was six.

32:33.393 --> 32:34.673
You still speak Russian?

32:56.073 --> 32:57.507
Mr. Kleiman's a good man.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.553
He'll look after you and your mother.

33:42.444 --> 33:43.673
Glad you came?

33:45.993 --> 33:47.153
I don't know yet.

33:54.571 --> 33:55.850
They're twins.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.632
Porfirio and Tadio. From Sardinia.

33:57.633 --> 33:58.832
You'd never guess,

33:58.833 --> 34:01.313
but their younger brother
drowned last month.

34:02.873 --> 34:04.912
They were smuggling ten kilos of cocaine

34:04.913 --> 34:06.850
for a Eurotrash party in Ibiza.

34:08.433 --> 34:09.712
They got caught in a storm,

34:09.713 --> 34:12.513
but didn't alert the
coastguard, for obvious reasons.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.592
Are they smuggling cocaine on this boat?

34:19.764 --> 34:20.953
You mean, am I?

34:26.473 --> 34:30.116
The most you could hide on
this yacht is around 250 kilos.

34:31.033 --> 34:33.192
One of your friend Mr.
Kleiman's cargo ships

34:33.193 --> 34:35.313
could smuggle at least
20 times that much.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.433
Are you a strong swimmer?

35:13.225 --> 35:14.503
You can relax.

35:15.433 --> 35:17.392
I'm not going to blackmail you.

35:17.393 --> 35:19.913
How you run your fund is your business.

35:21.913 --> 35:24.713
You still haven't told me
how I came to your attention.

35:26.526 --> 35:29.577
I knew your uncle,
as well as Mr. Kleiman.

35:30.513 --> 35:32.993
He mentioned you briefly
before he was killed...

35:34.193 --> 35:36.913
and then I discover you
went to Prague with Kleiman.

35:38.033 --> 35:40.147
We were observing him, not you.

35:58.113 --> 36:00.752
Why didn't you approach
Mr. Kleiman directly?

36:00.753 --> 36:02.392
All I do is invest his money.

36:02.393 --> 36:03.672
We did.

36:03.673 --> 36:05.952
We offered him a fortune
to lease his cargo ships,

36:05.953 --> 36:07.512
but he turned us down.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.512
He must have had his reasons.

36:09.513 --> 36:11.032
Of course.

36:11.033 --> 36:13.593
Who'd want to get in
business with someone like me?

36:15.953 --> 36:17.202
What about my uncle?

36:18.017 --> 36:20.725
Did you know he was planning
to kill Vadim Kalyagin?

36:21.833 --> 36:25.108
He asked me for backing,
and I gave it to him.

36:26.193 --> 36:28.072
If someone wants to get
rid of my competitor,

36:28.073 --> 36:29.713
I'm not going to stand in his way.

36:32.513 --> 36:35.912
If you're not interested in
blackmailing me, why am I here?

36:35.913 --> 36:37.673
I was curious to know who you are...

36:38.993 --> 36:41.152
and if we could help each other.

36:41.153 --> 36:42.832
To do what?

36:42.833 --> 36:45.313
I want to move my product
directly into Europe.

36:47.193 --> 36:48.552
In order to do that,

36:48.553 --> 36:51.432
I need your friend Kleiman's
ships and infrastructure.

36:51.433 --> 36:54.352
I was hoping you'd have more
luck persuading him than I did.

36:54.355 --> 36:55.860
How does that help me?

36:57.993 --> 37:01.072
I'd be competing with the
man who killed your uncle.

37:01.073 --> 37:04.793
Anything that hurts
Vadim is good for you, no?

37:13.980 --> 37:16.933
I invest Mr. Kleiman's money, that's all.

37:18.673 --> 37:20.273
I don't see how I can help you.

39:07.353 --> 39:09.552
What time's your flight tomorrow?

39:09.553 --> 39:11.072
Around four.

39:11.073 --> 39:12.712
So, come to the villa for lunch.

39:12.713 --> 39:15.032
It's on your way to the airport.

39:15.033 --> 39:17.272
That'd be great.

39:17.273 --> 39:19.769
One more chance to
see your gorgeous view.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.019
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, darling.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.593
Why don't we skip lunch
at Antonio's tomorrow?

39:34.993 --> 39:36.543
Stop off in Cannes.

39:37.633 --> 39:39.313
Why?

39:51.153 --> 39:52.673
Do you want to get engaged?

39:56.233 --> 39:58.089
Why are you proposing now?

40:02.273 --> 40:03.553
Sunstroke.

40:06.833 --> 40:08.992
You'll get embarrassed if I tell you.

40:08.993 --> 40:11.072
Probably...

40:11.073 --> 40:12.633
but go ahead.

40:19.433 --> 40:21.957
Without you, I have no idea who I am.

40:31.273 --> 40:32.873
Better say yes, then.

40:57.393 --> 40:58.593
No, thank you...

41:03.153 --> 41:04.752
How is he?

41:04.753 --> 41:06.273
You know Dmitri.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.353
It's for you.

41:44.188 --> 41:45.675
I won't see him again.

41:46.713 --> 41:47.913
Did I say that?

41:49.593 --> 41:53.160
You and I have to make a
decision. What's best for him.

41:54.553 --> 41:57.722
If seeing you is the only thing
that makes him happy, then...

41:59.316 --> 42:00.794
he should move in here.

42:02.962 --> 42:04.641
He'd never do that.

42:04.644 --> 42:06.233
Of course he will.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.136
He loves you, you love him.

42:10.553 --> 42:12.632
You'll look after him,

42:12.633 --> 42:14.472
take him to the park,

42:14.473 --> 42:16.712
listen to him complain,

42:16.713 --> 42:19.552
put him to bed when he's drunk

42:19.553 --> 42:21.873
and clean after him when he throws up...

42:23.513 --> 42:28.129
and when he's too old to wash
himself, not so far away now...

42:30.033 --> 42:32.273
you will wipe his ass with a Kleenex.

42:38.193 --> 42:39.713
I don't know what to say.

42:44.033 --> 42:45.393
There's nothing to say.

42:47.090 --> 42:49.970
You have him. All of him.

42:54.033 --> 42:56.457
Or you get out of my life.

44:53.473 --> 44:56.552
Three months ago, a man called
Reznik fell off the balcony

44:56.553 --> 44:57.886
of his apartment.

44:58.993 --> 45:00.752
You were in charge of the investigation,

45:00.753 --> 45:03.011
but found nothing suspicious.

45:06.433 --> 45:10.308
Either someone is paying you
to kill him or cover it up.

45:11.313 --> 45:13.834
I want to know who that is...

45:13.837 --> 45:17.652
and if it is same man who
bribed you to stop my trucks.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.113
Agh!

45:34.199 --> 45:36.082
I don't need you to say much.

45:37.393 --> 45:38.433
Just a name.

46:07.855 --> 46:08.993
The name?

47:18.553 --> 47:20.672
From the factory or fake?

47:20.673 --> 47:22.410
From the factory. It's real.

47:26.793 --> 47:28.752
100 euros.

47:28.753 --> 47:29.953
OK.

47:49.393 --> 47:52.792
Well, Sydney's theory is
that markets are amoral.

47:52.793 --> 47:54.832
They're designed to work like machines,

47:54.833 --> 47:59.152
but unethical behaviour like greed
and dishonesty get in the way.

47:59.153 --> 48:02.792
With respect, that's easy
for a billionaire to say.

48:02.793 --> 48:04.312
Back me up, Antonio.

48:06.033 --> 48:09.383
So, what, we should just
replace bankers with robots?

48:09.386 --> 48:10.993
And husbands, too.

48:14.913 --> 48:17.432
- I can only speak for Mexico...
- Do you have a minute?

48:17.433 --> 48:19.392
I'd like to show you
something before you leave.

48:19.393 --> 48:23.352
But greed and dishonesty
are crucial to our economy,

48:23.353 --> 48:28.073
and I'd even say... I'd even
say, it's the price to pay...

48:30.393 --> 48:33.912
If an efficient business loses
out to an inefficient business...

48:37.873 --> 48:40.872
So, when you see your friend Mr. Kleiman,

48:40.873 --> 48:43.353
I'd be grateful if you
passed on a message.

48:45.153 --> 48:48.352
I don't have the exact date
or the name of the ship,

48:48.353 --> 48:49.792
but some time next month.

48:49.793 --> 48:53.392
Vadim is planning to smuggle a
tonne of heroin through Mumbai.

48:53.393 --> 48:55.072
The deal was brokered

48:55.073 --> 48:58.432
by elements within Russian
and Pakistani intelligence.

48:58.433 --> 49:00.592
The shipment itself
is a drop in the ocean,

49:00.593 --> 49:02.472
but if something were to go wrong,

49:02.473 --> 49:05.673
it would embarrass Vadim in the
eyes of his backers in Moscow.

49:08.113 --> 49:11.113
Please assure Mr. Kleiman
I want nothing in return.

49:12.393 --> 49:14.254
It's a gesture of goodwill...

49:15.873 --> 49:17.713
and I have something for you, too.

51:11.816 --> 51:13.113
It's a gift.

51:14.356 --> 51:16.876
All I ask is that you
speak to Mr. Kleiman.
