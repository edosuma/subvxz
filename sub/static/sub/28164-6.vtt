-[Alyssa squeals]
-[thud on floor]

00:48.965 --> 00:50.592
[Alyssa squeals, giggles]

01:00.310 --> 01:01.144
[door bangs]

01:11.863 --> 01:13.323
I knew this would happen.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.366
I warned you.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.786
And now he has your Necrophone.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.916
And now I have to desecrate your corpse.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.626
Tell me, sister.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.089
What do you want me to do?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.469
Show me your desire.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.194
What?

01:51.653 --> 01:52.737
This is...

01:53.696 --> 01:55.031
You are…

01:56.241 --> 01:57.909
Pick a word. Any word.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.203
Astounding.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.750
Beautiful.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.212
Cool.

02:09.838 --> 02:10.672
Cool?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.343
Devastating.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.345
Excellent.

02:18.096 --> 02:18.972
Fantastic.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.474
Great.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.563
Hey, I'm only at G.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.897
I'll be right back.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.277
Hella cool.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.279
You already said "cool."

02:34.362 --> 02:35.196
[sighs]

03:06.603 --> 03:07.770
[Alyssa] What are you doing?

03:09.606 --> 03:10.899
I couldn't help myself.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.735
You don't know what's in there.
You could've unleashed something.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.737
-I just wanted to see.
-We had one job.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.239
Get the case, take it to Edward.
If he wanted us to--

03:19.324 --> 03:20.200
Oh, my God.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.743
It's the Necrophone.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.495
Pretend I'm a noob.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.080
It lets you talk to the dead.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
Like a Ouija board?

03:27.957 --> 03:31.920
You are a noob. Whoever you summon
must answer whatever you ask.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.840
-This is how he's gonna find them.
-Find who?

03:38.551 --> 03:45.433
[cellphone rings]

03:46.100 --> 03:46.935
Hello?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.937
Are you going to be predictable?

03:49.145 --> 03:50.021
[Jack]<i> Who is this?</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:51.648
[Sister] <i>In a little while,</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:54.234
<i>I knock on your hotel room door.</i>

03:54.484 --> 03:55.610
Ms. Marand?

03:56.277 --> 03:57.195
<i>Renée?</i>

03:58.363 --> 03:59.948
My sister is dead.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.324
What's she saying?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.494
It's her sister.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.162
Renée's dead.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.834
So, will you be smart...

04:13.211 --> 04:15.213
and return my property?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.549
<i>Or will you be predictable...</i>

04:19.175 --> 04:20.176
and run?

04:22.470 --> 04:23.638
If you run...

04:25.556 --> 04:28.518
everything you hold dear will be lost.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.938
<i>Yes, the girl will be dead,</i>

04:32.397 --> 04:33.731
so will you...

04:35.483 --> 04:37.402
and your grandfather...

04:38.611 --> 04:39.445
Pete.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.365
-Wait, how do you know--
<i>-I see your future,</i>

04:42.740 --> 04:44.033
your past...

04:45.785 --> 04:46.744
everything.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.039
<i>So, for once in your life,</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:52.333
make the smart choice.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.711
[phone beeps]

04:56.796 --> 04:59.215
I don't understand.
The transference worked.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.967
-She was healthy--
-Something went wrong.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.221
Her sister said she's gonna kill us
if we don't give her the Necrophone.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.432
Come on. Let's go.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.685
-We're not gonna talk about this?
-No talking. We can't give it to her.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.520
Get dressed.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.314
[Jack sighs]

05:14.981 --> 05:16.024
[knocking]

05:16.232 --> 05:19.110
[male voice]
Jonas! Consider yourself relieved.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.864
Yeah, yeah, I know I'm late,

05:22.947 --> 05:25.491
but come on, what else you got to do, huh?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.076
Don't be so...

05:30.663 --> 05:31.497
pouty.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.458
Holy shit.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.837
[Brandon] I think I'm gonna be sick.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.464
Do not fucking puke.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.174
I'm fine.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.800
I'm fine. [gulps]

05:47.388 --> 05:51.726
-What kind of cancer did that lady have?
-This wasn't fucking cancer, you dumb-ass.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.394
Then, what the hell?

05:56.981 --> 05:59.692
There's only one creature that targets
a victim's heart like this.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.696
A werewolf.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.741
There are werewolves?

06:07.116 --> 06:09.410
You've seen a golem
and this surprises you?

06:10.119 --> 06:11.996
How do you know they were werewolves?

06:12.538 --> 06:13.414
Because I...

06:14.916 --> 06:15.958
I've seen one in a book.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.462
I researched how to kill one
for the Magus.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.092
[Kyle] She thought it was a werewolf
that was killing the pledges.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.265
Come on. I know what to do.

06:32.892 --> 06:33.893
What about them?

06:33.976 --> 06:35.478
What about them, Brandon?

06:35.895 --> 06:36.979
Come on, let's go.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.078
She can see the future.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.872
Necromancers can only see
versions of the future.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.792
-Shadows. Possibilities.
-She sounded pretty sure.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.752
-She's trying to freak you out.
-It's working.

06:59.836 --> 07:00.753
We're not giving up.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.215
She knew stuff,
about my grandfather and...

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
Don't overthink it.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.643
Excuse me?

07:16.436 --> 07:19.188
We need to get to the bus station
or a train. What's closest?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.732
Definitely the bus depot.
Or I can call you a cab.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.235
She's probably listening to us
in a crystal ball right now.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.320
They're necromancers,
they don't use crystal balls.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.281
-[ringing]
-They use organs to define the future,

07:28.364 --> 07:29.740
-[ringing]
-not the musical kind.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.825
-Oh, shit.
-[groans]

07:30.908 --> 07:31.742
Are you okay?

07:31.826 --> 07:32.869
[crash]

07:33.077 --> 07:34.537
-[man growls]
-[Jack gasps]

07:34.620 --> 07:36.164
[sister's voice]<i> So predictable.</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:38.875
<i>I told you to wait. Now go back upstairs.</i>

07:46.924 --> 07:48.509
Alyssa, he's dead.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.892
[Jack]
Okay, if she can do that, we're screwed.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.895
-If she could kill, we'd be dead.
-Maybe she likes to torment her victims.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.814
-Either way, you're protected.
-Do you think Edward Coventry

08:01.898 --> 08:03.691
is worth your life?
'Cause I don't think so.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.651
We are not failing this assignment.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.863
It's time for some townie magic.

08:10.031 --> 08:10.865
Come on.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.010
[engine starts]

08:35.932 --> 08:37.808
Did you really have to rope me into this?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.186
-I didn't have a choice.
-Who gets up at this hour?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.187
[door opens]

08:41.938 --> 08:43.439
[Kyle] It's about time you showed up.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.149
Yeah, sorry. It's called a life.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.946
-[Gabby] No thanks. I'm on a cleanse.
-[Kyle] Not a request.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.030
You're not my tutor.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.282
No. Your tutor's dead.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.329
-I thought you were kidding.
-I told you. A werewolf killed him.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.830
-Werewolves are real?
-I know, right?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.624
Yes! Werewolves are real.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.169
And there's one on this campus.
So, the three of us are gonna find it,

09:05.253 --> 09:07.213
kill it, and drag it back here.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.592
This is <i>Oculus Veritatis.</i> True Sight.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.095
With this, you'll be able to see
any shape-shifter's true form,

09:14.178 --> 09:15.805
no matter how good their disguise.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.224
[Brandon] Cool. Like X-ray vision.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.810
[Kyle] No, Brandon, not like X-ray vision.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.062
You have to see skin
to see their true form.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.189
What happens when we find this thing?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.899
Do we shoot it? Do we get guns?

09:27.733 --> 09:28.776
Can I get an Uzi?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.742
[Kyle] Forget bullets.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.786
Forget silver, okay?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.914
Werewolves are magic,
and it takes magic to bring one down.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.833
Shouldn't that knife be a little bigger?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.503
You're reconnaissance only,
so don't worry about it.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.006
Split up, find it, and then, text me.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.632
What if it finds us first?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.343
Well, I guess you'll have to hope
it kills you fast, Brandon.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.804
Look...

09:57.763 --> 09:59.932
both of you, 'cause this decision

10:00.308 --> 10:02.977
you make right now
is gonna affect the rest of your lives.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.437
The Order needs you.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.190
So, you can step up and do this,
or walk away and never come back.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.943
Because you're either with us...

10:12.153 --> 10:13.112
or you're nothing.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.365
Make your choice.

10:33.049 --> 10:33.883
[exhales]

10:44.810 --> 10:45.770
You're human.

10:46.937 --> 10:47.813
Lucky.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.591
What are you looking at?

11:16.258 --> 11:17.259
Don't do drugs.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.772
Oh, shit.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.163
You were supposed to be here.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.292
You were supposed to come back.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.216
[knocking]

11:57.299 --> 11:58.467
Housekeeping.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.636
[door clicks]

12:02.179 --> 12:03.431
Should I try again later?

12:03.764 --> 12:05.891
No. Now's perfect.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.355
[sound of metal]

12:11.439 --> 12:13.441
-Ah!
-[squelch of blood]

12:13.524 --> 12:15.526
-[maid gasps]
-[door clicks shut]

12:17.361 --> 12:19.321
-[Kyle] Where is it?
-In here somewhere.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.532
You didn't follow it?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.826
Yeah. I'm gonna go follow a werewolf.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.036
It's True Sight.
To you, it looks like a werewolf.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.289
To the rest of these morons,
it looks like a human being.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.206
Then you go and look.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.504
Jesus. Let's go!

12:44.180 --> 12:45.848
[voice] In this world, we made a choice...

12:51.020 --> 12:52.188
[girl's voice] Can I help you?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.031
[Hamish] We talk about

13:02.114 --> 13:04.575
living our authentic lives.

13:08.412 --> 13:12.166
[Hamish]
But how do we identify our true self?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.629
Is there some authentic Hamish

13:16.712 --> 13:20.591
that is the truest version
of my consciousness? [snarls]

13:20.674 --> 13:22.176
If there is, I guarantee you,

13:22.259 --> 13:25.429
that guy still prefers his
martinis stirred, not shaken.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.680
[chuckles]

13:28.182 --> 13:30.643
-Is my true self what I make of it?
-[knocking]

13:31.852 --> 13:33.979
Is my true self what I make of it,

13:34.897 --> 13:37.483
or am I just along for the ride

13:37.566 --> 13:40.986
and desperately trying to justify
social expectations?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.866
-[door bangs open]
-[Kyle pants]

13:46.575 --> 13:47.409
Can I help you?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.874
-[sound of metal]
-[Hamish gasps]

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
[Hamish groans]

14:01.507 --> 14:03.300
[crash]
[Kyle thuds]

14:03.384 --> 14:04.260
[snarls]

14:05.177 --> 14:06.846
That's it. See you next week.

14:07.096 --> 14:07.930
Okay.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.607
Then put me through to him.
He'll wanna hear from me.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.361
When will he be back?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.492
Alyssa Drake. A, L, Y, S, S, A.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.579
No, just one Y.
Do you know when Edward will be...

14:33.581 --> 14:34.415
back?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.709
Eddie still isn't picking up?

14:39.503 --> 14:40.588
Jack Morton...

14:42.089 --> 14:44.049
-you're jealous.
-Of course not.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.551
[laughs]

14:45.634 --> 14:47.386
You are. You're so jealous.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.472
What's there to be jealous of?
The guy's, what? A thousand?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.474
He's only in his forties.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.895
It came up when I googled him.

15:10.784 --> 15:16.165
[cellphone rings]

15:18.292 --> 15:19.126
Yeah?

15:19.209 --> 15:21.003
[sister]
<i>Because of you, I have to be outside.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:24.089
I hate being outside.
You're not making this easy for me.

15:24.673 --> 15:26.008
Sorry to disappoint you.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.593
What's she saying?

15:27.676 --> 15:30.262
Three times I've seen your future today.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.765
And three times you've changed it.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.185
No one has that much control
over their destiny.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.687
You're supposed to be dead already.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.023
-What is she saying?
-That we're supposed to be dead.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.983
[sister]<i> You're different.</i>

15:45.027 --> 15:46.028
What are you?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.366
Just a guy driving a girl home.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.534
Yeah. I'm just sitting here.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.536
Put her on speaker phone.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.455
Yes, put me on speaker phone.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.629
Your future is hazy.

16:04.922 --> 16:05.965
It’s shifting.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.592
I'm not used to that.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.096
So how about letting us go?
We'll give the Necrophone to Edward

16:12.179 --> 16:14.765
and when he's done with it,
we'll bring it back to you. I promise.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.477
Edward murdered my sister.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.980
<i>And I can tell you don't like him either.</i>

16:21.397 --> 16:22.398
I knew it.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.817
You're gonna listen to her?

16:25.442 --> 16:26.902
Jack, why are we fighting?

16:27.736 --> 16:29.488
We both want the same thing.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.076
<i>Or do you not want Alyssa</i>
<i>to know your secret?</i>

16:35.452 --> 16:37.287
Alyssa wants to know your secret.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.415
She's just trying to freak you out.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.582
[engine starts]

16:47.256 --> 16:51.468
-[engine revs]
-[tires scream]

16:51.552 --> 16:53.220
[Jack] She's going the other way.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.098
Right. She can see the future.
I will get the hang of this.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.308
The weirdest car chase I've ever been in.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
How many car chases have you been in?

17:04.481 --> 17:06.316
[Hamish groans]

17:06.442 --> 17:08.819
-[Kyle] Gabrielle, have you seen it?
-No.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.487
I did not sign on for monster slaying.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.448
What the fuck did you think
this was gonna be?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.033
Some kind of summer fucking-magic camp?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.951
[B] I thought it was gonna be better
than this.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.454
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I miss Jack Morton right now.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.664
At least that clown wanted
to be part of The Order.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.791
-At least he put in an effort.
-I make an effort.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.461
Oh, my God.
Just shut up and cover the exits, okay?

17:25.794 --> 17:26.628
God!

17:29.465 --> 17:32.384
[Hamish's heart beating]

17:35.429 --> 17:38.098
[faint sound of cellphone buttons]

17:38.932 --> 17:40.934
[cellphone connects]

17:41.518 --> 17:43.395
[cellphone rings]

17:43.729 --> 17:44.772
[Randall sighs]

17:47.191 --> 17:48.650
What's up, Hamish?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.570
-You know those Order friends of Jack's?
<i>-Hot and hotter?</i>

17:51.987 --> 17:53.072
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:56.200
They know I'm a wolf. They're hunting me.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.160
Dude, what? How?

17:58.577 --> 17:59.953
<i>I don't know, Randall.</i>

18:00.037 --> 18:03.040
How do you think a magical secret society
would hunt a werewolf?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.374
I don't know.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.251
Enchanted knives?

18:08.295 --> 18:10.380
[gasping]

18:10.506 --> 18:12.758
That might explain
why my wound isn't healing.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.093
Wait, you're hurt?

18:14.718 --> 18:16.178
Where are you? I'll come get you.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.014
<i>Stay put.</i>
<i>One secret identity blown is enough.</i>

18:19.098 --> 18:20.724
-No, fuck that.
<i>-No.</i>

18:20.808 --> 18:23.519
I need you to find a way
to heal a magical wound.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.646
On it.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.527
[groans]

18:47.835 --> 18:51.547
[grunting]

18:56.510 --> 18:58.637
[Brandon] Gabby, this is the nearest door.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.732
[Gabby] ... you should go one way
and I'll go the next...

19:11.275 --> 19:14.444
[fire bell rings]

19:14.695 --> 19:16.405
-[man] Fire alarm!
-[woman] Seriously, again?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.740
-[man] Gonna grab my bag.
-[other man] You don't get to.

19:18.824 --> 19:25.622
[fire bell continues]

19:33.046 --> 19:34.298
[Alyssa] We need to go.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.342
We also need an engine
that won't blow up on us.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.761
She did this.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.263
She murdered the car?

19:41.930 --> 19:43.432
Why not?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.976
It's gotta be easier than killing
a person, which she also did.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.603
We can put a stop to all of this.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.063
This is what you signed up for.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.817
-Is it cool yet?
-Edward backed out of the plan.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.652
He was supposed to cure Renée,
and then--

19:55.736 --> 19:59.072
-You saw her. She was completely well.
-Until she died.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.617
Why are you so quick to defend him?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.327
Why are you so quick to judge him?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.663
For all we know, it's Renée Marand
who's chasing us and she's just

20:06.747 --> 20:08.832
pretending to be her own twin,
she's messing with us.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.292
All these conspiracies.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.669
That's literally the first conspiracy
I've pitched.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.796
Why can't people just be people anymore?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.549
I mean, her sister's dead.
Maybe she just wants to talk to her.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.473
That woman is not like you.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.517
I mean, I understand
why you would want to...

20:29.937 --> 20:31.104
Talk to my dead mother?

20:31.939 --> 20:32.898
Yeah, I would.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.944
But I don't wanna introduce you in person.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.447
Thank you.

20:41.031 --> 20:41.990
You're welcome.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.827
-But we're not giving it back.
-Okay. Okay.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.206
It should start now.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.223
I swear to you, I thought it just needed
to cool down.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.018
-Want me to carry that?
-I've got it.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.604
-I'm not gonna hand it over.
-Yeah, you're right about that.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.076
I take it that's your car back there.
Are you kids all right?

21:26.159 --> 21:27.369
Yeah, it broke down.

21:27.995 --> 21:28.870
Well...

21:29.454 --> 21:31.164
you're heading the wrong way for help.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.458
A whole lot of nothin' in that direction.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.128
Hop in, I'll give you a lift.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.717
Not a serial killer,
if that's what you're thinkin'.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.635
I don't even own a banjo.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.014
-A ride would be great.
-No, thank you.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.558
Remember that guy in the hotel?

21:52.894 --> 21:54.187
Actually, we're good.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.613
-Is everything all right here?
-Yeah. She's fine.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.282
I wasn't askin' you, son.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.829
-Now, I'm gonna ask her again. And I...
-[ringing starts]

22:10.912 --> 22:12.873
[ringing]

22:13.582 --> 22:15.751
And I'd appreciate--
[groans]

22:16.710 --> 22:17.544
[crash]

22:17.627 --> 22:20.005
[A] When is she gonna stop?
I'm sorry I brought you into this.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.631
Not your fault. I wanted to be here.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.010
[panting]

22:25.093 --> 22:26.053
[snarling]

22:36.355 --> 22:37.397
-[thud]
-Jack!

22:37.481 --> 22:38.899
-[crash]
-[Alyssa screams]

22:39.107 --> 22:41.360
[sister's voice]
<i>You really should've seen this coming.</i>

22:41.443 --> 22:43.028
-No!
<i>-I did!</i>

22:45.364 --> 22:47.532
[snarls]

22:47.616 --> 22:48.658
Jack!

22:48.742 --> 22:49.951
[coughs]

22:50.410 --> 22:51.870
[snarls]

22:51.953 --> 22:54.915
[Alyssa] Jack, Jack!

22:54.998 --> 22:56.375
Ja... Jack!

22:56.666 --> 22:59.461
[Alyssa screaming]

22:59.795 --> 23:00.962
[tires squeal]

23:01.046 --> 23:01.880
Jack!

23:02.506 --> 23:03.340
Jack!

23:07.928 --> 23:11.181
-[Alyssa gasps]
-[case crashes]

23:13.975 --> 23:15.852
[cellphone rings]

23:15.936 --> 23:16.812
[Jack groans]

23:16.895 --> 23:18.897
[cellphone rings]

23:21.358 --> 23:23.151
Listen, you fucking psycho!

23:23.235 --> 23:24.945
-Hey.
<i>-Lilith?</i>

23:25.529 --> 23:27.072
Sorry, wrong psycho.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.199
Look, I can't talk right now.

23:29.282 --> 23:32.202
[Lilith] Do you have time for Hamish
being killed by your Order buddies?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.413
What? What are you talkin' about?

23:34.496 --> 23:36.206
The Order is hunting us.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.792
They've some kind of magic
and can see that we're wolves.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.128
They saw Hamish, now they're tracking him.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.381
Nah, that doesn't make sense.
How would they know to look for you?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.886
You stopped the transference.
You ate their hearts, didn't you?

23:49.970 --> 23:52.597
That's why Renée is dead.
That's why I'm in this shitstorm.

23:52.681 --> 23:56.101
Oh, boo-hoo. What's the matter,
is your precious Order mad at you?

23:56.184 --> 23:59.896
I'm out in the middle of nowhere
with a necromancer trying to kill me.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.356
Yeah, well, that...

24:01.523 --> 24:03.942
-actually sounds pretty bad.
<i>-Look,</i>

24:04.025 --> 24:06.653
I told you to leave it alone,
but, no, you had to go full-on Kilith.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.114
Guys, priorities.
Hamish is injured.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.616
<i>We need a Hail Mary here, Jack.</i>

24:13.827 --> 24:17.747
Look, there's a book in the sanctuary.
It explains how to heal magical wounds.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.708
Okay. What's it called?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.127
I don't know. It's brown. I gotta go.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.843
Maybe Jack was right.
Maybe we should've let that spell go.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.470
Jack's a dick!

24:38.935 --> 24:40.562
[male voice] I think we should hang out.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.484
Yeah, I can bring the costume.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.278
[Hamish sighs]

24:49.613 --> 24:50.697
Nice costume.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.365
Wolf, right?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.993
[cellphone rings]

24:55.327 --> 24:57.162
Listen to me, you fucking psycho.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.788
[Renée's sister] <i>She's alive.</i>

24:59.122 --> 24:59.956
Let her go.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.835
-Deliver the Necrophone.
-Don't do it, Jack! Don't trust her!

25:04.211 --> 25:06.087
Consider that proof of life.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.965
<i>Stay on the road.</i>

25:10.091 --> 25:11.176
You'll see us.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.428
And whatever you're thinking of doing...

25:14.429 --> 25:15.347
don't.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.021
He's special.

25:25.023 --> 25:25.982
Do you know why?

25:28.818 --> 25:29.778
Guess not.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.323
Maybe that's why you're the end of him.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.158
You don't know that.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.286
You said it yourself,
you can't see his future.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.289
No, but I have seen yours.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.293
And every version ends in tragedy.

25:49.714 --> 25:50.549
Why?

25:51.466 --> 25:52.300
Ask Eddie.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.096
The Grand Magus would never hurt me.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.018
My sister... used to get
that same look in her eye.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.356
Wouldn't let anyone speak a bad word
about Coventry.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.402
After he crossed her, she smartened up.

26:10.485 --> 26:11.736
[sharp ringing]

26:12.779 --> 26:13.655
He's here.

26:17.993 --> 26:22.205
[Alyssa whimpering]

26:22.330 --> 26:24.874
Jack! Why didn't you listen to me?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.085
He listened to his heart.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.674
[Kyle] We had it cornered
and you let it get away?

26:32.757 --> 26:35.719
Hey, don't blame him
for your half-assed wolf hunt.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.597
-Watch your tone.
-I don't answer to you.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.684
Just because you're in

26:43.310 --> 26:45.228
doesn't make you untouchable, okay?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.147
They cut people all the time.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.733
One girl, we got in together.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.027
Then she screwed up real bad.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.738
Now, she doesn't even remember me.

26:54.821 --> 26:55.905
Lucky her.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.450
You could be lucky, too.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.078
Oh, there! There he is!

27:04.289 --> 27:06.082
Shut up. Asshole.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.627
Now, split up and go find it.

27:12.005 --> 27:12.922
What?

27:15.008 --> 27:15.884
[Hamish] Oh, God.

27:17.093 --> 27:23.767
[bubbling]

27:25.226 --> 27:27.020
Is this supposed to be bubbling like that?

27:27.729 --> 27:29.314
That means...

27:30.523 --> 27:31.483
it's working.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.611
-[door opens]
-[coughing]

27:34.694 --> 27:35.654
[Randall] Hello?

27:36.696 --> 27:37.530
Hamish.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.992
Come on. Come on.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.619
-Did you ditch them?
-For now.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.912
Let's get to the couch.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.705
Here we go.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.001
Go, Timber Wolves.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.880
Where'd they get you?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.841
Right here. Ah!

27:57.550 --> 27:58.510
[Randall] Oh!

27:58.968 --> 28:02.389
Oh, Jesus. It even smells terrible.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.683
Like vomit and sulfur had a baby.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.311
[Lilith] Okay, just breathe.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.230
-Randall, hurry.
-Yep.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.107
Okay.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.692
[Hamish mumbling]

28:13.817 --> 28:14.943
[Hamish yells]

28:15.026 --> 28:16.319
Sorry, sorry.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.279
It's supposed to work fast.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.115
[Hamish groans]

28:21.157 --> 28:22.158
How fast?

28:24.327 --> 28:27.205
[Hamish pants]

28:27.288 --> 28:29.332
That's amazing.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.126
Ah!

28:32.335 --> 28:34.170
[Hamish coughs]

28:34.254 --> 28:35.964
Dude, thank you.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.550
-Thank Jack. It was his idea.
-Where is he?

28:39.008 --> 28:40.385
Off fighting a necromancer.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.887
Actually, it sounds kind of fun.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.391
-We should go help him.
-We need to deal with Kyle

28:46.474 --> 28:48.435
and his little death squad first.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.354
Agreed. Let's kill those assholes.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.816
-That's not gonna solve anything.
-But we'll have killed some assholes.

28:54.899 --> 28:58.361
We need to be smart about this.
The Order's looking for a werewolf.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.779
Let's give 'em one.

29:04.075 --> 29:04.909
Get it.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.587
[snarls]

29:15.962 --> 29:16.838
Now, let her go.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.822
[Alyssa whimpers]

30:08.640 --> 30:09.891
Renée Marand.

30:12.769 --> 30:13.853

30:15.313 --> 30:16.231
Sister...

30:17.982 --> 30:19.317
what would you have me do?

30:19.818 --> 30:20.860
<i>Kill them.</i>

30:21.694 --> 30:22.904
<i>All of them.</i>

30:23.571 --> 30:27.450
<i>But beware of the boy.</i>
<i>His magic is strong.</i>

30:28.368 --> 30:29.619
I felt it.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.663
Why?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.874
<i>Because he's a werewolf.</i>

30:37.293 --> 30:38.336
What the fuck?

30:39.963 --> 30:40.797
Jack!

30:41.631 --> 30:44.759
That explains everything.

It's gonna be okay.

33:21.833 --> 33:22.667
You're a...

33:24.460 --> 33:25.420
What are you?

33:26.713 --> 33:27.630
I'm a Knight.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.759
You're a monster.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.446
Kyle?

33:52.321 --> 33:54.323
-Kyle?
-What's gotten into you?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.535
That thing killed our people.
We have to take it down.

33:57.618 --> 33:58.786
"Our people?"

34:11.466 --> 34:12.884
[Gabby] Or maybe Kyle was right.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.762
Maybe the Order isn't for you.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.271
[faint snarling]

34:31.486 --> 34:34.822
[faint snarling]

34:38.493 --> 34:39.452
Oh, shit.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.828
That can't be good.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.585
-What was that?
-Please, be a deer.

34:47.877 --> 34:48.836
Please, be a deer.

[Brandon whimpers, laughs]

35:15.488 --> 35:16.322
Kyle?

35:29.669 --> 35:31.671
[Vera] You knew about a werewolf attack,

35:32.630 --> 35:34.507
you used unsanctioned magic,

35:35.007 --> 35:38.261
you went on a rogue hunting spree,
and you failed to report

35:38.636 --> 35:40.179
any of this to me...

35:41.055 --> 35:41.973
why?

35:42.557 --> 35:44.976
Silence. Subservience. Observance.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.855
-Explain.
-Kyle was my superior.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.148
I had to obey him.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.442
Did you ever think
he might be making a mistake?

35:54.861 --> 35:56.279
Like, literally all the time.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.031
And yet, you did as you were told.

36:00.950 --> 36:01.951
Yes, Magus.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.919
What is it, Ms. Dupres?

36:13.713 --> 36:15.423
I think there are more out there.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.015
Put that knife back in the reliquary,

36:24.140 --> 36:27.351
and then assemble a team
and get over to the church.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.147
I want you to clean up the mess
from the Elemental Transference.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.443
-At once, Magus.
-Can't take one fucking...

36:35.526 --> 36:36.694
[door slams]

36:54.921 --> 36:57.381
[Brandon] Did you see the way
Gabrielle took Kyle down?

36:57.465 --> 36:58.591
She's vicious.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.301
[Lilith] She's an idiot.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.595
Yeah, she's a "vidiot."

37:03.221 --> 37:04.764
-Did I miss it?
-Nope.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.307
All good.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.185
Dude.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.229
This look great. What is it?

37:12.021 --> 37:14.523
-"Forever Young."
-Just for hide returns.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.780
How long does this take?

37:21.197 --> 37:23.616
It's hard to say.
Some return home faster than others.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.743
-Do I have to wait to drink this?
-I'm not.

37:26.661 --> 37:27.495
[crash]

37:27.954 --> 37:29.538
Oh, shit!

37:29.747 --> 37:31.457
I'm never gonna see one.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.293
-I hope you're right.
-To cannon fodder.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.462
It's too bad Jack wasn't here.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.589
-Ooh!
-"Too bad Jack wasn't here."

37:38.798 --> 37:40.883
Hey, shut up.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.886
Hey, this is just a negroni.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.657
Where'd you get that truck?

38:05.825 --> 38:06.826
Who's the girl?

38:07.076 --> 38:08.452
There's a case in the cab. Grab it.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.705
-What's the case--
-Stop asking so many questions.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.864
Come on, she'll be fine.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.432
You wanna tell me about it?

39:18.898 --> 39:20.524
Pops, I don't even know where to begin.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.070
Why don't you start with the case?

39:40.503 --> 39:41.337
Holy shit.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.220
Holy shit.

39:49.678 --> 39:50.513
I know.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.373
Say her name.
