WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.128
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.337 --> 00:04.005
There might be
a fallout shelter

00:04.214 --> 00:06.132
built to sustain thousands.

00:06.341 --> 00:07.133
The second dawn.

00:07.342 --> 00:08.593
They built a bunker?

00:08.802 --> 00:09.803
Their whole theology
was based on riding out

00:10.011 --> 00:11.304
the end of the world.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.765
I have bad news, Abby.
Black rain's here.

00:13.974 --> 00:15.392
It's worse than we thought.

00:15.976 --> 00:18.144
It burns on contact.
It kills.

00:18.353 --> 00:19.688
We need a solution.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.357
We can't create Nightblood
unless we go to space,

00:22.899 --> 00:23.608
but Luna can.

00:24.109 --> 00:26.152
We can inject ourselves
with her bone marrow.

00:26.361 --> 00:27.654
Then we become
Nightbloods.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.280
The only way
to know if it works

00:29.489 --> 00:30.740
is to test it.

00:30.949 --> 00:32.033
Who do we test?

00:32.242 --> 00:34.160
Baylis. You don't
know what he did to me.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.996
I'm gonna make him
suffer for what he did

00:36.204 --> 00:37.288
to me and my brother.

00:38.289 --> 00:38.915
Wait.

00:39.124 --> 00:40.500
What if his death
could save us all?

00:42.961 --> 00:47.799
Hey. If this works,
we survive.

00:48.675 --> 00:50.301
It's as simple as that.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.775
Vital signs are strong.

01:09.821 --> 01:11.740
Jackson,
seal the chamber.

01:12.657 --> 01:13.616
Copy that.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.208
He's ready.

01:23.668 --> 01:26.171
Yeah. But are we?

01:29.841 --> 01:31.134
The guy's
a monster.

01:31.384 --> 01:32.552
We've been over this.

01:33.553 --> 01:35.638
None of us wants to do this,

01:35.847 --> 01:38.058
but the death wave
will be here in 10 days.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.186
Luna's stem cells
grafted successfully.

01:42.062 --> 01:44.064
Baylis is making
Nightblood on his own.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.067
This really is
our only hope.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.152
We really still
talking about this?

01:50.070 --> 01:51.696
Black rain is already here.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.782
18 people died in it
yesterday at Arkadia,

01:53.990 --> 01:56.034
so if Nightblood can
let us walk around in it,

01:56.493 --> 01:58.161
I, for one,
want to know about that.

02:05.919 --> 02:06.920
OK.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.633
Jackson, proceed.

02:12.425 --> 02:13.468
Copy that.

02:13.635 --> 02:14.928
Initiating.

02:26.856 --> 02:27.857
500 rem.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.739
850.

02:35.448 --> 02:38.576
This is where we'd see symptoms
in a non-Nightblood.

02:39.828 --> 02:41.287
BP is 100 over 50.

02:41.496 --> 02:43.540
Body temp is 98.7.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.501
Resting comfortably.

02:47.502 --> 02:49.087
No visible effects.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.678
1,000 rem.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.308
1,500.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.854
All good here.

03:06.062 --> 03:08.982
2,000 rem,
the level of the black rain.

03:10.483 --> 03:13.236
Still nothing. It's working.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.489
2,500.

03:19.951 --> 03:20.869
Wait.

03:21.828 --> 03:22.662
No.

03:26.082 --> 03:26.958
Turn it off.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.176
Aah!

03:36.384 --> 03:37.260
Get him
out of here.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.304
Wait. It's
not safe yet.

04:22.222 --> 04:23.181
What have we done?

04:57.423 --> 04:58.758
I know it took courage

04:59.425 --> 05:01.469
to be outside with us today,

05:02.387 --> 05:04.931
to stand together now
in the face of grave danger

05:05.556 --> 05:07.267
and grave tragedy.

05:08.351 --> 05:13.106
On the ark, rain like this
was only a dream.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.276
Now it's a nightmare,

05:16.484 --> 05:19.862
because we know it could turn
at any second and kill us,

05:20.071 --> 05:23.074
just like it did to 18 of
our brothers and sisters,

05:23.700 --> 05:25.326
who we honor today

05:25.535 --> 05:30.999
among them, Erin, Samuel,
and Louis.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.126
May we
meet again.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.044
May we meet again.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.883
Too many funerals,
too little time.

05:41.092 --> 05:42.302
Show some respect
for the dead.

05:42.552 --> 05:44.637
What for?
They don't mind.

05:45.430 --> 05:46.472
Hey, where
you going?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.183
Wherever the day
takes me.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.143
You got a chem tent?

05:50.351 --> 05:51.019
Nope.

05:51.936 --> 05:54.522
Jasper. Jasper.

05:54.856 --> 05:56.816
No one leaves
without a chem tent.

05:57.025 --> 05:58.735
Do you have a chem tent?

05:58.943 --> 06:01.195
- Yeah.
- Good. Then we have a chem tent.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.366
Maybe you didn't see
how those people died.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.494
I saw. I'm just not afraid

06:08.703 --> 06:10.038
of it happening to me.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.666
Jasper, it's not
safe out there.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.335
What else is new?

06:18.212 --> 06:21.382
Come on.
We're losing daylight.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.093
Jasper.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.723
Jasper. Damn it. Hey.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.476
Grow the hell up.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.227
Good. You're coming.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.479
Yeah, but only because

06:34.687 --> 06:36.439
I don't want to carry
your body bag.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.358
Oh, come on.
I'm pretty light.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.151
I mean, I'm wiry,
but I'm light.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.070
Kriken
Sonraun en Branon.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.280
Kom graun,
oso na groun op.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.783
Kom folau,
oso na gyon op.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.038
That's beautiful.

06:52.205 --> 06:53.373
What's it mean?

06:54.415 --> 06:56.542
From the earth,
we will grow.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.586
From the ashes, we will rise.

07:02.632 --> 07:04.133
What did you just say?

07:05.301 --> 07:08.554
Sorry. I didn't think
you would mind if I...

07:08.763 --> 07:13.184
Niyah, "From the ashes
we will rise."

07:13.393 --> 07:15.144
Where does that come from?

07:15.520 --> 07:17.688
Come from?

07:17.897 --> 07:19.899
You'd have to ask
a Fleimkepa.

07:20.108 --> 07:21.067
All I know is
it's what we say

07:21.275 --> 07:23.444
to ready our dead
for the fire.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.949
It's not
a coincidence, Marcus.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.076
I need to speak
with the Flamekeeper.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.329
You already found
the second dawn bunker.

07:34.831 --> 07:35.623
It was--

07:35.832 --> 07:37.875
the wrong bunker.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.129
Cadogan said only
those who reached

07:41.337 --> 07:43.256
level 12 would be saved.

07:45.591 --> 07:46.926
This is level 11.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.137
What I found was a decoy

07:49.345 --> 07:51.764
built to keep the level 12
bunker from being overrun.

07:51.973 --> 07:53.266
How could you
possibly know that?

07:53.474 --> 07:54.809
Because that's
what I would do.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.520
And you think
Indra's daughter

07:57.728 --> 07:58.896
knows where
the real bunker is?

07:59.147 --> 08:00.606
I think there's a reason

08:00.857 --> 08:02.817
"From the ashes we will rise"
became a grounder prayer

08:03.443 --> 08:05.153
just like I think
there was a reason

08:05.319 --> 08:07.864
that a corporate logo
became their sacred symbol.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.449
The infinity sign.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.700
Yes.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.787
I can reach out
to Indra.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.706
She might know
where gaia is.

08:17.123 --> 08:18.332
I'll assemble a team.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.293
Thelonious, wait.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.545
Polis is a war zone.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.338
We won't be
welcome there.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.798
So we travel light.

08:26.007 --> 08:29.343
For this, we'll need
thinkers, not fighters.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.561
What's going on?

08:40.354 --> 08:43.232
Kane and Jaha need
an engineer for a mission.

08:44.442 --> 08:46.402
Kane and Jaha!

08:47.445 --> 08:48.237
Well,
looks like someone's

08:48.446 --> 08:49.489
moving up in the world.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.408
It's just too bad
in 10 days,

08:52.617 --> 08:54.619
there won't be a world
to move up in.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.543
How much have you
had to drink?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.545
Just the right amount.

09:17.767 --> 09:18.976
Harper.

09:20.228 --> 09:21.729
I get it.

09:22.522 --> 09:23.481
Duty calls.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.192
Hey, hey. Hey.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.657
We will find a way
out of this.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.709
I have to go.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.462
So go.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.965
I'll be here
if you get back.

09:53.928 --> 09:56.556
When. I mean when.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.040
How's the weather,
Reyes?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.334
Forecast still calling
for death?

10:28.129 --> 10:29.922
The stones
of his ancestors.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.385
Abby,
take a look at this.

10:35.094 --> 10:35.886
Of course.

10:40.391 --> 10:41.434
What is it?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.811
Sodium polyethanol sulfonate.

10:43.978 --> 10:46.188
It's an additive used
to prevent clotting.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.524
Looks like the radiation
broke it down

10:48.733 --> 10:50.234
and caused a chain reaction.

10:50.443 --> 10:52.069
What happens
if we remove it?

10:53.154 --> 10:54.780
We could save everyone.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.324
You could?

10:56.907 --> 10:58.326
So you're saying
this can still work.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.869
Not without
testing.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.705
The last guy just died,
screaming in agony,

11:02.913 --> 11:04.457
and you want
to try it again?

11:06.459 --> 11:10.004
Give us a better
idea, Raven. Please.

11:11.464 --> 11:13.341
So what,
we just go out there,

11:13.841 --> 11:15.051
hunt for someone else?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.802
No one's going anywhere
in this storm.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.429
Then we wait
for it to pass.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.805
When it does,
there may not be

11:20.014 --> 11:21.265
anyone left
to hunt for.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.267
Hunting for someone
else to kill.

11:23.476 --> 11:25.518
What's the matter
with you people?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.772
Even Baylis
honored the dead.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.483
He wore the stones of
his rock line ancestors.

11:31.484 --> 11:32.652
Who will honor him?

11:33.194 --> 11:37.114
Wait.
Baylis was Sangedakru.

11:37.782 --> 11:40.034
He was.
He was also a thief.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.619
He probably stole
those stones.

11:41.911 --> 11:43.496
A thief who didn't
bear the mark

11:43.704 --> 11:44.497
of Sangedakru.

11:51.462 --> 11:54.799
That wasn't Baylis,
was it?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.217
Come on, Clarke. That's
crazy. Of course--

11:57.218 --> 11:58.594
who did
we just kill?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.472
- Hey, Emori--
- Emori, no!

12:01.681 --> 12:02.848
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

12:03.057 --> 12:04.600
- Aah!
- Emori, go easy.

12:04.809 --> 12:06.185
John, take out
the machine!

12:07.895 --> 12:09.647
Don't do anything
stupid, Murphy.

12:10.231 --> 12:11.691
Looks like
we know who's next.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.160
I know it's bad and
everything is dying and all,

12:23.369 --> 12:25.412
but I'm just gonna say it--
I don't miss mosquitoes.

12:25.413 --> 12:26.372
Don't miss them.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.666
This is all a big
joke to you, isn't it?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.126
Now you're getting it.

12:30.543 --> 12:31.961
That's exactly what it is.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.171
One big cosmic joke.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.257
You'd realize that, too,
if you pulled

12:36.465 --> 12:37.091
the stick out of
your ass.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.301
That's enough.
That is enough.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.934
I'm just trying
to help you.

12:47.143 --> 12:48.310
Oh, you're trying
to help me.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.562
That's funny.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.065
It's late.
We're leaving. Now.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.609
Damn it.
Open your eyes!

12:57.445 --> 12:59.530
The clock is ticking,
and it has been

12:59.739 --> 13:01.323
since we landed
on this terrible...

13:03.451 --> 13:04.618
Beautiful planet.

13:04.827 --> 13:05.953
What the hell
does that mean?

13:06.162 --> 13:09.582
It means we are living on
borrowed time, all of us.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.000
So if you know that,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.335
why are you
throwing it away?

13:13.544 --> 13:16.714
I'm not. You are.

13:19.425 --> 13:22.219
What is the point
in beating yourself up

13:22.428 --> 13:25.014
over all of the--the crappy
things you've done?

13:25.222 --> 13:26.223
You did them!

13:26.557 --> 13:29.143
And--and don't say
you had reasons,

13:29.351 --> 13:30.227
because at the end
of the day,

13:30.436 --> 13:31.771
at the end of
the world,

13:31.979 --> 13:34.482
nobody gives a damn
about your reasons,

13:34.690 --> 13:37.067
because they are
your reasons.

13:37.777 --> 13:40.154
No matter how much
you punish yourself,

13:40.362 --> 13:41.906
it's not gonna
change anything.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.117
It's not gonna bring
anyone back.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.586
The way I see it is

13:56.462 --> 13:58.464
we can spend our last days

13:58.672 --> 14:00.382
wallowing in our reasons

14:00.591 --> 14:01.926
or we can do--

14:03.469 --> 14:05.596
we can do whatever
the hell we want!

14:08.682 --> 14:10.142
Really mean it this time.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.483
Magic beans.

14:19.652 --> 14:20.778
Remember those?

14:20.986 --> 14:22.613
Hallucinogenic nuts.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.907
That's why you
dragged me out here?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.617
If you think I'm
taking those again,

14:27.618 --> 14:29.161
you really are crazy.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.623
Whatever the hell
you want.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.135
Now you're
gonna lock us up?

14:46.262 --> 14:47.930
What, she was just trying
to save her own life.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.306
Well, we're not gonna touch

14:49.515 --> 14:51.350
your stupid machine, all right?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.018
Please, Clarke!

14:53.269 --> 14:55.312
Can't do this
to us, Raven, please.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.730
Don't let them do this to us.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.148
Don't let them
do this to us.

15:01.402 --> 15:03.112
Please tell me
you're not actually
considering

15:03.320 --> 15:05.030
putting Emori
in that chamber.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.246
Mom, I don't know
what else to do.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.206
There is nothing else to do.

15:14.415 --> 15:15.499
We all know it.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.209
Abby, there
has to be something

15:17.418 --> 15:18.794
that doesn't
make us murderers.

15:19.003 --> 15:21.547
Jackson and I have
examined every possibility.

15:22.882 --> 15:24.758
And the only thing
that we know for sure

15:24.967 --> 15:26.677
is that if we
do nothing,

15:27.970 --> 15:29.096
we die.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.939
Jackson, prep Luna
for the next extraction.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.445
No. You've taken enough.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.697
Luna, it's OK.
We'll sedate you.

15:46.906 --> 15:48.115
I said no.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.618
I won't allow
my blood to kill

15:50.784 --> 15:51.911
any more
innocent people.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.329
Luna, please.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.832
Your blood is the one
thing that can save us.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.043
My blood is a curse.

16:00.544 --> 16:01.211
It will,
however, keep you

16:01.420 --> 16:03.172
from following me
into the rain.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.257
Luna, you can't,
not with that hip.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.014
We can't
let you leave.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.474
We need you, Luna.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.559
Is there no line
you won't cross

16:15.768 --> 16:16.977
in order to survive?

16:17.645 --> 16:20.648
Survival
requires sacrifice.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.149
If the Freikdreina dies--

16:22.358 --> 16:24.151
don't call her that.

16:25.110 --> 16:28.280
If she dies
saving the world,

16:29.031 --> 16:29.865
that is a good death.

16:30.074 --> 16:31.659
Luna, please.

16:33.077 --> 16:34.078
You're wounded.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.455
And I don't want
to fight you.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.793
You have no choice.
Remember?

16:54.932 --> 16:56.767
Aah!

17:07.194 --> 17:08.654
Sleep well,
Natblida.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.213
So you're gonna
strap her down

17:26.422 --> 17:27.464
and take her bone marrow?

17:30.634 --> 17:31.885
Welcome to mount weather.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.578
Black rain.

17:59.455 --> 18:00.539
It fell here, too.

18:25.564 --> 18:26.982
I thought she was
your friend.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.859
She is.

18:30.027 --> 18:31.945
That's why we're
still alive.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.447
Wait here.

18:33.989 --> 18:34.990
Weapons down.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.829
Indra...

18:41.371 --> 18:42.456
Thank you for meeting me.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.543
I didn't know if you would.

18:46.752 --> 18:47.461
Oh!

18:51.340 --> 18:53.509
Don't smile at me, Kane.
What do you want?

18:55.427 --> 18:57.429
I'm here.
You have 30 seconds.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.973
After that, as the ally
of my enemy,

19:00.182 --> 19:01.642
you are my enemy.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.268
Indra, you have to know
that we had nothing

19:03.477 --> 19:05.437
to do with the attacks
on your land or embassy.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.190
What I know
is that Azgeda

19:08.398 --> 19:10.859
marched on Arkadia,
and yet you made

19:11.068 --> 19:13.570
another alliance
with them, a deal

19:14.196 --> 19:16.490
to save their
people, not mine.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.075
I know how it looks,

19:19.034 --> 19:20.494
but, believe me,

19:20.661 --> 19:22.538
we're still trying to find
a way to save everyone.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.082
Then you are a fool.

19:25.624 --> 19:28.544
You're fighting for a city
that won't exist in 10 days.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.130
What's more foolish
than that?

19:31.630 --> 19:32.923
The radiation
doesn't care

19:33.132 --> 19:34.883
if you're Trikru
or Azgeda.

19:36.468 --> 19:39.179
If we can't come together
to fight this enemy,

19:40.389 --> 19:41.807
then what hope
is there for us?

19:42.599 --> 19:44.351
The only hope
we ever have:

19:45.727 --> 19:47.271
To die
a warrior's death.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.815
Indra, wait. Indra!

19:50.315 --> 19:51.441
We need to speak
to your daughter.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.652
She could be the one
that saves us all.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.241
How?

20:22.681 --> 20:24.641
Gaia, these men
need your help.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.318
The tattoo.
Look. The center.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.177
Still think it's
a coincidence?

21:06.058 --> 21:07.059
Where did you get this?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.644
Oh, I found it.

21:09.186 --> 21:10.437
And I now believe it's

21:10.896 --> 21:12.147
so it could lead me to you.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.068
Tell us
about the symbol.

21:16.693 --> 21:17.736
Where does it
come from?

21:19.488 --> 21:21.240
It's the holy symbol
of our order.

21:21.573 --> 21:22.449
Mother.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.159
Gaia, please.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.578
Skaikru helped you
protect the flame.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.455
Help us now.

21:33.669 --> 21:35.796
It adorns the crypt
of the first commander,

21:36.421 --> 21:37.339
Bekka Pramheda.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.007
Where is the crypt?

21:39.549 --> 21:40.592
You think it's the bunker?

21:40.801 --> 21:42.052
It's in the temple.

21:42.261 --> 21:44.096
Controlled by Azgeda,

21:44.263 --> 21:45.597
as are the tunnels.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.224
So how do we get in?

21:47.683 --> 21:49.101
We fight.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.602
Indra.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.314
Like it or not,

21:55.524 --> 21:57.317
Azgeda is
our ally.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.444
We have
the royal seal.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.571
No one has to die.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.157
You're assuming they'll
honor the seal.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.160
The closer we get
to Praimfaya,

22:07.369 --> 22:10.163
the less alliances
seem to mean.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.416
How much faith
do you have in yours?

22:53.290 --> 22:54.583
First, we survive.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.422
Then we find
our humanity again.

23:06.762 --> 23:07.804
I'm sure they said
the same thing

23:08.013 --> 23:09.181
in mount weather, too.

23:24.946 --> 23:25.906
You OK?

23:26.406 --> 23:27.532
Are you?

23:27.908 --> 23:28.867
Nightbloods.

23:29.493 --> 23:30.702
You'd think I'd have
learned my lesson

23:30.911 --> 23:32.037
after Lexa.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.344
We're doing
the right thing.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.013
You sure about that?

23:50.931 --> 23:52.891
Certainty's a luxury
leaders can't afford.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.519
I'm no king.

23:55.727 --> 23:59.189
Maybe not, but you
were born for this.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.984
Lexa knew it, and so do I.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.862
You don't back down
when things get hard.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.448
It's always hard.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.659
And yet here you are.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.291
I know you
don't believe it now,

24:18.500 --> 24:21.294
but one day,
they will thank you

24:21.503 --> 24:23.338
for what you're
doing here.

24:24.381 --> 24:25.632
Murphy won't.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.843
Emori won't.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.470
If it works, they will.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.723
What if it
doesn't work?

24:33.932 --> 24:35.559
Then we die knowing

24:35.767 --> 24:37.936
we did everything we could
to save our people.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.732
Did you come up here
to make me feel better?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.444
It's never been
my strength.

24:59.875 --> 25:00.876
It's OK!

25:01.334 --> 25:03.003
I carry the seal
of your king.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.550
Azgeda Planhaka.

25:08.758 --> 25:11.720
Keep your head down.
We agreed. They'll let us pass.

25:12.929 --> 25:13.680
Weapons down.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.358
I'm the Skaikru chancellor.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.904
As your ally, we seek
safe passage to the temple.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.057
They were letting us pass!

25:57.557 --> 25:59.017
If there's a bunker there,

25:59.226 --> 26:02.062
Azgeda will never see
the inside.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.906
Come on, Marcus.

26:13.657 --> 26:14.824
It's not our war.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.624
Roan will think
that we did this.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.770
Be quick. Echo
will send reinforcements.

26:45.146 --> 26:45.939
Where is it?

26:48.358 --> 26:49.442
It's beneath the altar.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.458
It's here. I knew it.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.501
Help me.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.448
What does that mean?

27:36.948 --> 27:39.576
It means
"Salvation lies within."

27:39.909 --> 27:40.910
We were taught it referred

27:41.119 --> 27:42.787
to the ship that
brought her to us.

27:43.872 --> 27:45.040
How do we
open it?

27:48.543 --> 27:50.337
Like every other lock,
Mr. Green.

27:53.381 --> 27:54.507
With a key.

28:15.320 --> 28:15.987
Uh! No.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.697
Can you open it
or not?

28:19.324 --> 28:20.116
We have to.

28:22.285 --> 28:23.703
We need more time.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.455
Can you reposition your
army at the temple?

28:25.664 --> 28:27.123
If I do that,
we lose the tower.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.625
The tower won't save you.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.377
Neither
will the ashes of
the first commander,

28:30.585 --> 28:32.337
if that's all
that's down there.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.880
Mother, please.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.301
I'll move
my guard detail

28:38.510 --> 28:39.302
to the temple door.

28:39.511 --> 28:40.887
Buy you some time.

28:42.347 --> 28:43.848
But I'll need
your guns.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.853
Just give her
the damn guns, Marcus.

29:05.328 --> 29:07.956
I fear that
jus drein, jus daun

29:08.957 --> 29:10.125
will be the end of us all.

29:11.126 --> 29:11.793
Gaia...

29:13.712 --> 29:16.047
It would seem you
should keep praying.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.186
Got it started
without us.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.938
Got what started?

29:38.194 --> 29:39.070
Fun.

29:41.406 --> 29:42.240
Come on.

29:46.619 --> 29:47.871
Everyone's gonna
die, Bellamy.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.457
We can go out
like them...

29:51.332 --> 29:52.876
Or like us.

29:53.543 --> 29:54.586
The ending's
the same,

29:54.794 --> 29:57.547
but who says the
journey has to suck?

29:58.757 --> 30:00.008
I come bearing fruit!

30:14.397 --> 30:15.023
Jobi nuts are

30:15.231 --> 30:16.649
powerful medicine.

30:17.567 --> 30:18.693
You sure about this?

30:19.652 --> 30:20.945
I'm pretty sure.

30:21.362 --> 30:24.407
In that case,
I recommend a tea.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.077
Teatime.

30:37.045 --> 30:37.962
Hey.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.089
Dance with me.

30:41.132 --> 30:42.300
I don't dance.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.054
I don't really want
to dance.

30:52.477 --> 30:53.353
Come on.

30:57.732 --> 31:00.318
- Yes!
- Ha ha!

31:00.902 --> 31:03.780
Good idea. Let someone else
save the world for once.

31:08.868 --> 31:09.702
Ahh!

31:10.870 --> 31:11.788
Yeah.

31:19.796 --> 31:20.880
John, enough.

31:23.424 --> 31:24.676
You can't stop this.

31:24.884 --> 31:27.595
No. No, Emori. I'm not
letting this happen to you.

31:27.804 --> 31:28.721
You have to.

31:28.930 --> 31:29.556
What?

31:29.722 --> 31:30.765
John, listen to me.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.309
Make them think
you're OK with this.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.104
We make Clarke think
you're still with her.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.856
Emori, I'll kill her if she
even thinks about hurting--

31:38.064 --> 31:39.899
no. Damn it, John.
Think.

31:40.942 --> 31:41.943
Don't give them
a reason

31:42.151 --> 31:43.611
to pick you next.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.240
Survive, please.

31:57.917 --> 31:58.877
It's time.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.211
Guys, just wait, OK?
Hear me out.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.045
John.

32:01.254 --> 32:02.338
It'll work this time.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.800
Then how about we
just go with that

32:06.301 --> 32:07.302
and forget the test?

32:12.265 --> 32:13.933
Miller? Miller, don't--

32:14.142 --> 32:16.561
Miller! Miller, I swear
to God, I'll kill y--

32:17.645 --> 32:18.813
Miller,
Miller, Miller, please.

32:19.022 --> 32:19.897
Miller,
just look at me, man.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.149
You don't need to do this.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.526
I wish that were true.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.278
You don't have to do this!

32:31.200 --> 32:32.994
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

32:34.746 --> 32:35.788
I'm trying to save us.

32:35.997 --> 32:36.915
Save us?

32:37.665 --> 32:38.291
Ah, right.

32:38.499 --> 32:39.959
Wanheda,
savior of us all!

32:40.293 --> 32:42.128
But maybe you're
forgetting the last
time you saved us,

32:42.337 --> 32:43.338
I was saving you!

32:43.546 --> 32:44.505
I'm not forgetting.

32:44.714 --> 32:45.381
You haven't forgotten?

32:45.590 --> 32:47.050
Then, please, you don't
need to do this.

32:48.092 --> 32:48.968
Don't do it.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.846
Please, please, you
don't need to do this.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.474
You know,
it's too bad that you

32:54.682 --> 32:55.391
weren't
a real Nightblood

32:55.600 --> 32:56.559
because then you could
have been commander.

32:56.768 --> 32:58.436
Imagine how many people
you could've killed then.

33:01.147 --> 33:01.898
Tell me something,

33:03.441 --> 33:05.193
after you murder Emori,
am I next?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.488
OK! I'm begging you,
please. I love her.

33:08.696 --> 33:09.906
Don't do this.

33:10.281 --> 33:11.658
Emori will be fine.

33:13.826 --> 33:14.494
Hey.

33:16.537 --> 33:17.497
Look at me.

33:17.705 --> 33:18.331
If she dies...

33:20.083 --> 33:21.042
You die.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.514
Waah!

34:27.442 --> 34:28.484
Mom...

34:30.903 --> 34:32.363
We have to do this.

34:53.426 --> 34:54.677
I can't.

34:58.848 --> 34:59.932
I'll finish it.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.338
I bear it
so they don't have to.

35:35.384 --> 35:36.177
Clarke.

35:40.056 --> 35:41.015
No.

35:42.558 --> 35:43.476
No.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.314
We're testing me.

36:12.839 --> 36:14.257
It worked.

36:19.637 --> 36:22.473
It's been two hours.
How do you feel?

36:25.977 --> 36:26.811
Ready.

36:34.318 --> 36:35.778
I won't let you do it.

36:35.987 --> 36:37.780
Mom, I trust you.

36:39.574 --> 36:40.408
It'll work.

36:41.659 --> 36:42.410
Turn it on.

36:42.618 --> 36:43.536
Jackson, don't.

36:45.204 --> 36:45.997
Clarke...

36:46.414 --> 36:49.292
If you go in there,
you will die.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.086
I saw it.

36:53.087 --> 36:54.088
What are you
talking about?

36:54.297 --> 36:55.339
I saw it.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.050
Like I saw the rocket.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.180
We're wasting time.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.056
- No.
- Mom.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.893
- Wait. Abby.
- Mom, don't!

37:07.101 --> 37:08.436
- Abby, don't!
- Abby!

37:08.644 --> 37:10.146
- Stop!
- Stop, Abby!

37:22.116 --> 37:25.786
Don't worry. It'll
all be over soon now.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.975
I can't lose you.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.068
You're OK.

38:06.827 --> 38:07.995
Come on.

38:15.711 --> 38:16.712
I told you,

38:17.421 --> 38:18.756
it has never
been opened.

38:22.677 --> 38:23.636
It's now or never.

38:27.682 --> 38:29.433
We were brought here
for a reason, gaia.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.560
Think. Is there another key?

38:31.727 --> 38:33.603
It--it would have
a "12" on it.

38:35.898 --> 38:37.024
I'm sorry,
but we have to go.

38:37.275 --> 38:38.359
You should've
brought more guns.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.860
Then move your army
into position.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.113
I will not give up
the tower for the temple

38:42.488 --> 38:43.614
and a door you
cannot open.

38:43.906 --> 38:45.199
Thelonious,
we can come back.

38:45.408 --> 38:48.869
When, before or after
the death wave?

38:50.121 --> 38:51.080
Leave if you have to go.

38:51.289 --> 38:52.915
I'm not going
anywhere.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.542
I'm staying, too.

39:04.051 --> 39:05.594
Maybe we are not worthy.

39:07.305 --> 39:09.181
Maybe we are meant
to burn in Praimfaya.

39:09.682 --> 39:11.559
No. We're not
meant to burn.

39:11.767 --> 39:15.062
We were meant to rise
from the ashes.

39:18.941 --> 39:19.692
Wait.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.444
What is it, Monty?

39:21.819 --> 39:24.155
"From the ashes
we will rise."

39:25.156 --> 39:26.699
What if it's not
just a motto?

39:28.534 --> 39:29.952
What if it's an instruction?

39:40.004 --> 39:41.005
Do it.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.113
The 12th seal.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.697
Ready? 1, 2...

41:07.133 --> 41:09.176
Hold this temple.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.054
After you, my friend.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.850
Salvation lies within.
