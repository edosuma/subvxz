in, like, 30 minutes or so.

street and see how it goes.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.501
Okay, honey, be safe.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.462
Bring warm clothes and a sword.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.804
And look out for pitchforks.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.140
Don't you let anyone scoop
your brains out, either.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.474
Maybe stay in the shadows.
