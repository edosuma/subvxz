LINDSAY: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.703 --> 00:03.737
I'm on call

00:03.770 --> 00:05.238
for my rape crisis
center today.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.471
Is that going
to be okay?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.074
I thought you were
just in training.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.643
I thought you were
volunteering nights.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.711
I finished training
this weekend,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.345
and I am
volunteering nights.

00:12.378 --> 00:15.415
Can I get you anything --
a blanket, maybe?

00:15.448 --> 00:17.350
No! Aah!

00:17.383 --> 00:20.486
She panicked.
She totally panicked.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.288
Well, you won't
do that next time.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.290
There's not going
to be a next time.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.425
Maddie.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.293
Are you Lucy?

00:27.327 --> 00:28.328
Yeah.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.298
Thank you.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.367
Sure.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.270
I'm going to see you
at the clinic, right?

00:37.303 --> 00:39.540
I'll be there.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.175
Harland Bassett
to see Eugene Young.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.443
Is he available?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.411
Um...

00:45.445 --> 00:48.549
Eugene.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.083
She's my niece,

00:50.116 --> 00:51.618
so naturally,
I have a vested interest,

00:51.652 --> 00:53.286
besides
her being innocent.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.188
Is it a burglary?

00:55.221 --> 00:57.223
No, no, no,
just shoplifting.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.793
It's a false I. D.,
Eugene.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.863
-Are you certain this is
the woman you saw?
-I am.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.230
-Positive?
-Yes.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.633
At this time,
I would ask

01:06.667 --> 01:08.702
that the real Emma Luger
please stand up.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.672
I will see counsel
in chambers.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.439
Both of you
are in contempt.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.108
I didn't know.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.677
I told you I would
hold you accountable.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.679
You're in contempt.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.384
Who's your D. A.?

01:24.417 --> 01:25.752
Helen Gamble.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.088
You know, I actually
really like working with her.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.792
Don't you have a kid
to go home to?

01:31.825 --> 01:34.227
I do, and I'm going.
How late are you going to be?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.296
Oh, not much longer.

01:36.329 --> 01:37.664
Richard.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.505
Guzman -- 18 months.

01:44.538 --> 01:48.241
That's the same offer
you made over the phone.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.512
I know. I came here
to make it in person.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.913
What's the matter?

01:52.946 --> 01:53.914
Nothing.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.583
I just think you should
take the deal on Guzman.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.753
The drugs weren't his.
I can't recommend him --

01:59.786 --> 02:01.888
He won't win this.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.291
You're acting a little odd.
Why have you come down here?

02:05.325 --> 02:08.261
I'm talking to you now
not just as a D. A., Lindsay,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.830
but one with whom your firm
has a relationship.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.799
Do your client
a very big favor

02:12.833 --> 02:14.835
and convince him
to take this deal.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.438
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.806
What is going on?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.875
I'm just here
to suggest very strongly

02:21.908 --> 02:23.610
that he take
the 18 months.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.178
That's all I will say.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.948
The offer is rejected.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.418
Linsay, please.

02:32.452 --> 02:33.754
Tell me more
than what you're telling me.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.489
I can't.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.525
The offer is rejected.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.773
â™ª (theme)

03:40.721 --> 03:42.956
18 months doesn't sound
like a terrible offer.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.291
He says
the drugs weren't his.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.460
Understood, but if your defense
is the police planted them,

03:47.493 --> 03:48.929
when he's got a prior --

03:48.962 --> 03:51.464
Well, first of all,
I think I can beat the search.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.333
What if you can't?
Will the deal still be there?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.801
I don't know.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.270
Take it.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.271
Take it.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.673
Take it.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.575
Eugene?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.747
I saw you, Eugene.
Very funny.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.421
After the detective,
I'll call you to the stand.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.857
You'll make the I. D.,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.858
and then I'll ask you
to describe the rape.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.060
Now, I'm going
to need you

04:20.093 --> 04:22.328
to be as detailed
as possible.

04:22.362 --> 04:24.998
Okay, Meredith?

04:25.031 --> 04:27.333
Meredith?

04:27.367 --> 04:29.636
Okay.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.037
Look, I know
this is rough,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.706
but I'll be there
with you.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.440
I'll walk you
through this.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.843
I don't understand why it's me
who has to go on trial.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.411
You won't be on trial.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.480
It's just going
to seem that way.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.884
I'll come get you
in a few minutes.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.519
Okay.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.725
Your parents
didn't fly in?

04:51.758 --> 04:54.728
I talked them
out of it.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.465
The truth is the less people
that know me in there,

04:59.499 --> 05:01.034
the better.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.605
Meredith, you don't have
any shame in this.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.372
I know, but that
defense attorney,

05:06.406 --> 05:08.474
he is going to blame me.
You said that yourself.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.344
I also said that
that's standard strategy

05:11.377 --> 05:12.746
in date rape cases.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.882
If you just go in there
and stay strong,

05:15.916 --> 05:19.352
stick to the truth,
you're going to be fine.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.755
Thank you for being here.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.825
I would have never made it
this far.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.894
Well, you have.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.931
There's just a little
further to go.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.968
The stuff wasn't mine.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.369
10 grams, Manny.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.071
You could be looking
at a lot of time.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.040
Look, if they're offering
18 months,

05:40.073 --> 05:42.475
that tells me the D.A.
knows this is weak.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.678
Or maybe he knows
the drugs were planted.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.614
I don't think he'd prosecute
if he thought that.

05:50.150 --> 05:54.387
Look...

05:54.420 --> 05:57.390
this D. A., he seems
to be suggesting

05:57.423 --> 06:00.026
that something else
could be in play here.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.495
Do you know
what that could be?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.464
No.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.799
Could he be bluffing,

06:05.832 --> 06:07.467
afraid he might lose
the suppression hearing?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.537
It's possible, but I didn't
get that feeling.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.839
Why not just try
with the motion to suppress?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.407
And if we lose --

06:14.440 --> 06:15.776
My concern is

06:15.809 --> 06:17.944
the state may pull the plea
if they win on that.

06:17.978 --> 06:22.148
The stuff wasn't mine.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.451
I'm not going
to cop to it.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.724
Let's try to suppress.
We'll go from there.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.567
Ms. Dole.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.469
Uh, look,

06:43.504 --> 06:45.839
I basically raised
my brother.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.874
He never knew
his father.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.011
Now, he's an honest kid,
and he's made mistakes,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.714
but he owns them
when he does.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.216
Look, what I'm trying
to say is

06:56.249 --> 06:58.985
if he says
the drugs weren't his,

06:59.019 --> 07:00.554
they weren't his.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.923
I'll do my best, Hector.

07:02.956 --> 07:07.460
Ms. Dole, look, I --
I've done okay for myself.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.997
I have the auto shop
and all, but...

07:11.031 --> 07:14.601
Manny -- he's good
at school, even.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.470
He's got a chance
at college.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.741
I'll help your brother
as best I can.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.442
Thank you.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.212
I developed the case.
I already settled out

07:26.246 --> 07:27.881
with the doctor.
I just need --

07:27.914 --> 07:28.949
For $45,000.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.785
13-year-old girl,
liver failure?

07:31.818 --> 07:33.486
$45,000 seems low.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.888
They needed the money.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.489
Plus, the drug company
is the deep pocket here.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.224
Well, have they
offered anything?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.226
Not yet,
but you know how this goes.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.629
Things get settled
on the courthouse steps.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.664
I expect an offer.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.533
Oh, you do.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.702
The girl got hurt bad,
Eugene, like you say,

07:48.735 --> 07:50.170
and these big
drug companies,

07:50.203 --> 07:52.138
they don't like
the publicity of trials.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.641
They don't like to set
a precedent of settling, either.

07:54.675 --> 07:58.044
Now, you said this drug comes
with a warning to doctors --

07:58.078 --> 08:00.246
"Not proven
to be safe and effective

08:00.280 --> 08:01.915
on children under 16."

08:01.948 --> 08:03.617
Saying "Not proven
to be safe"

08:03.650 --> 08:05.218
is different
from saying "Dangerous."

08:05.251 --> 08:07.654
I'm telling you, Eugene,
there's a case here.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.755
They'll settle this.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.794
Okay.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.962
And why do you need me?

08:15.996 --> 08:19.232
Well, my track record
in product liability cases --

08:19.265 --> 08:22.102
I don't think I exactly
put the fear of God in them.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.639
Now, your case
where you took on the EPA --

08:25.672 --> 08:26.940
A $30 million verdict.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.609
It was cut down.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.943
But you got the verdict.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.078
If I have you guys
on board as co-counsel,

08:32.111 --> 08:34.080
I know I can
chip the settlement up.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.182
I'll give you
a third of my contingency.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.851
Harland, I don't know.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.687
Please. These are
good people, Eugene.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.121
Yeah, but every time
I sign up with you,

08:42.155 --> 08:43.323
I end up
getting embarrassed.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.291
That's not going
to happen this time.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.927
I've worked hard here.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.595
I developed the file.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.664
I beat their motion
to dismiss.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.132
I got it to trial.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.735
I got it to trial.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.671
But you don't think
you can win at trial.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.774
That's why you're
so desperate to settle.

09:00.807 --> 09:04.077
I just want to be sure
they get something.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.287
We had been to a party
and he was walking me home.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.922
HELEN: The defendant?

09:15.956 --> 09:18.625
Yes.

09:18.659 --> 09:24.465
And we got
about halfway to my dorm

09:25.932 --> 09:27.233
when...

09:27.267 --> 09:29.335
When what, Meredith?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.972
Well, first he just
started saying

09:32.005 --> 09:34.340
that he was going
to come back to my room

09:34.374 --> 09:36.677
with me so that
we could fool around.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.379
What did you say
to that?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.381
I think
I laughed it off.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.850
I didn't want to be mean,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.719
so I didn't
really answer him.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.955
And then when we got
to my room,

09:48.989 --> 09:50.056
we went inside.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.692
You let him in?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.393
Yes.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.328
We were still talking,

09:55.361 --> 09:57.864
and I had some soda
in my refrigerator,

09:57.898 --> 10:00.366
so we had a drink.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.970
And then, suddenly,
he just grabbed me,

10:04.004 --> 10:06.072
and he tried
to kiss me.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.974
What did you do then?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.976
I pushed him off.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.978
We weren't even
on a date.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.948
He was just walking me home
from a party.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.851
And what happened after
you tried to push him off?

10:17.884 --> 10:19.853
I think I laughed again,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.187
I don't know,

10:21.221 --> 10:24.124
to make the situation
less awkward,

10:24.157 --> 10:28.394
but I told him,
"No. It's time to go."

10:28.428 --> 10:31.732
And he grabbed me again.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.034
After you said no?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.101
Yes.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.838
He pushed me
onto the floor.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.873
And then what, Meredith?

10:39.906 --> 10:42.809
He pulled up my skirt

10:42.843 --> 10:47.047
and...

10:47.080 --> 10:50.016
he pulled my panties down.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.885
What did you do?

10:51.918 --> 10:55.021
I tried
to fight him off,

10:55.055 --> 10:59.960
but he had my knees
pinned to the floor,

10:59.993 --> 11:03.396
and I couldn't...

11:03.429 --> 11:07.901
and then he was, um...

11:07.934 --> 11:10.937
forcing himself
inside of me.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.308
And did you have intercourse?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.443
It wasn't intercourse.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.113
At anytime did you
consent to this?

11:20.146 --> 11:21.748
No.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.419
He was raping me.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.362
I was on night patrol

11:36.396 --> 11:37.831
when I saw the defendant
run the stop sign.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.099
I pulled him over.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.366
What happened next?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.968
As I approached
the defendant's vehicle,

11:42.002 --> 11:43.036
he made a furtive gesture.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.305
What exactly did he do?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.807
He reached
under the seat

11:46.840 --> 11:47.841
as if he was going
for a weapon.

11:47.874 --> 11:48.909
And what did you do,
officer?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.110
Fearing for my safety,

11:50.143 --> 11:51.444
I pulled out
my service revolver

11:51.477 --> 11:53.446
and asked him
to step out of the vehicle.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.215
I then began
to search the vehicle

11:55.248 --> 11:56.249
for a possible weapon.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.918
Did you find any?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.385
No, but under
the driver's seat

11:59.419 --> 12:01.121
was a plastic baggie
containing what was

12:01.154 --> 12:03.023
later determined to be
10 grams of crack cocaine.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.490
I placed the defendant
under arrest

12:04.525 --> 12:06.092
and advised him
of his rights.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.263
You feared
for your safety?

12:10.296 --> 12:11.765
That's correct.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.534
After you got
the defendant out of his car,

12:13.567 --> 12:15.001
what did you do next?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.402
I searched for weapons.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.138
Did you call
for backup?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.540
No, I thought
I could handle it.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.274
Did you pat frisk?

12:21.307 --> 12:23.276
Actually, I thought
the weapon was in the vehicle.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.878
How about handcuffs?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.179
At that point, no.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.281
You were alone,
and you left my client

12:28.314 --> 12:30.183
unrestrained
and unsupervised?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.818
Like I said,
I thought I could--

12:31.852 --> 12:32.819
While you were
searching the vehicle,

12:32.853 --> 12:33.920
where was
the defendant standing?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.889
A few feet behind me,
I guess.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.257
You turned your back
on him

12:37.290 --> 12:38.892
while in fear
for your safety?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.994
Only for about
30 seconds or so.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.096
Your honor, we move to suppress
all evidence in this case.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.531
Officer Lemay's search here

12:44.565 --> 12:46.432
clearly does not fall
under the terry exception.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.234
He has failed to provide
any legal basis

12:48.268 --> 12:49.836
for a weapon search.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.005
The fact that the defendant
made a furtive gesture

12:52.038 --> 12:53.106
is not disputed here.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.274
If you consider

12:54.307 --> 12:56.109
the defendant's
suspicious behavior,

12:56.142 --> 12:57.978
the time of night,
the neighborhood --

12:58.011 --> 12:59.379
a reasonable
police officer

12:59.412 --> 13:01.114
would have feared
for his safety

13:01.147 --> 13:02.215
and searched the car.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.050
Perhaps,
but the fact remains,

13:04.084 --> 13:07.287
Officer Lemay failed to conduct
a simple pat frisk.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.991
That tells me he wasn't
threatened by this defendant,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.293
nor was he concerned
for his safety.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.829
I am finding the search
to be illegal.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.430
The charges are dismissed.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.079
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.081
Manuel Guzman,
you're under arrest.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.883
-Get your hands off him!
-Step back, sir.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.885
What's going on here?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.153
Immigration, your honor.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.187
We're placing this man
under arrest.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.523
On what grounds?

13:42.556 --> 13:44.424
Violations of the Illegal
Immigration Reform

13:44.457 --> 13:46.059
and Immigrant
Responsibility act.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.595
What?

13:48.629 --> 13:50.931
WOMAN: What's happening?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.237
You're deporting him?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.305
Don't worry, Manny.
I'll take care of this.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.942
Don't say a word to anybody,
okay? Do not talk.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.254
Where to?

14:14.287 --> 14:17.457
I guess
the conference room.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.325
What's going on?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.394
Oh, uh, Harland Bassett.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.929
Yes, I know.
What's going on?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.497
Eugene and I have
a settlement conference.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.032
Here?

14:26.066 --> 14:28.569
Yes. Opposing counsel wanted
to have it at my office,

14:28.602 --> 14:31.204
I think because they suspect
I don't have one.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.606
Harland --

14:32.639 --> 14:34.274
I can't have our office
cluttered up --

14:34.307 --> 14:36.376
I will make it
all neat, I swear.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.646
Eugene.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.555
I didn't know he was going
to bring the stuff here.

14:48.589 --> 14:51.391
What's this case,
and what's our involvement?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.193
Product liability
against a drug company

14:53.226 --> 14:55.028
that injured a little girl.
Harland --

14:55.061 --> 14:56.697
This guy ponies you up
every time.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.199
I told him I'd join him
for a settlement conference.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.466
That's all it will be.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.369
Why can't you ever say no
to this guy?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.172
Very good question.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.445
You invited my client
into your dormitory room,

15:12.478 --> 15:14.681
didn't you, Ms. Danzer?

15:14.715 --> 15:16.316
I didn't invite him in
to have sex.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.152
You invited him in,
offered him a drink.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.587
A soda.

15:20.621 --> 15:22.255
Had you been drinking
alcohol that evening?

15:22.288 --> 15:24.558
I had had
some alcoholic punch, yes.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.993
And, Ms. Danzer,
when you say that my client

15:27.027 --> 15:29.395
grabbed you and kissed you
against your will,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.497
you admit that
you kissed him back.

15:31.532 --> 15:32.633
Isn't that correct?

15:32.666 --> 15:35.401
I kissed him
a little bit,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.605
but I wasn't reciprocating.
I didn't want to --

15:38.639 --> 15:42.142
You didn't want to what,
rebuff his advances?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.745
I didn't want
to totally hurt his feelings,

15:44.778 --> 15:46.980
but he knew
that I wasn't interested.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.149
Move to strike.

15:49.182 --> 15:54.087
Sustained. Ms. Danzer, please
don't tell us what he knew.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.289
I told him to stop.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.424
I pushed him off of me.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.426
After this incident
occurred --

16:00.460 --> 16:02.428
It wasn't an incident.
It was rape.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.497
After it occurred,

16:04.531 --> 16:06.366
did you then
call the police?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.068
Eventually.

16:08.101 --> 16:12.138
How long after this incident
did you call the police?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.740
Three days.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.408
Three days?

16:15.441 --> 16:17.243
I was confused.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.279
Confused about
whether you'd been raped?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.380
I wasn't --

16:20.413 --> 16:22.148
I was in shock.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.651
I needed
to talk to someone,

16:24.685 --> 16:26.520
so I went
to the rape crisis center

16:26.553 --> 16:28.388
to talk to a counselor.

16:28.421 --> 16:33.126
You met
with a rape counselor?

16:33.159 --> 16:36.162
Yes, at the Boston
Crisis Center.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.400
Do you remember
the counselor's name?

16:40.433 --> 16:44.337
Yeah -- Lucy Hatcher.
She's right there.

16:48.609 --> 16:51.645
What did you tell
Ms. Hatcher?

16:51.678 --> 16:52.713
Objection.
Privilege.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.515
Sustained.

16:54.548 --> 16:58.151
Did you become clear
that you'd been raped

16:58.184 --> 17:01.154
after talking
to this counselor?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.123
Yes.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.391
After meeting
with this counselor,

17:05.425 --> 17:08.228
that's when you decided
to call the police?

17:08.261 --> 17:10.329
Yes.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.673
I'm an American.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.107
You were born
in this country?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.407
No, but --

17:22.442 --> 17:24.176
I adopted Manny when
he was a year old.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.412
He was my sister's boy.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.315
She came here from Colombia
to get her green card.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.217
She was only here
for a month

17:31.251 --> 17:33.453
when she was killed
in a car accident.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.355
You legally adopted him?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.658
Yes. I have
all the court papers.

17:37.691 --> 17:40.861
Did you file papers
with the immigration service?

17:40.894 --> 17:45.131
Nobody advised me
I-I had to do that.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.600
Okay.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.335
Technically, Manny isn't
a resident of this country.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.771
-What?
-HECTOR: Why?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.839
You're not a U. S. citizen,
and because you have

17:52.873 --> 17:54.675
a felony drug conviction
on your record,

17:54.708 --> 17:56.610
the I. N. S. Has the power
to remove you.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.580
They want to send you
back to Colombia.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.181
Back to Colombia?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.849
He doesn't even
know anyone in Colombia.

18:02.883 --> 18:04.317
We have no family there.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.852
He doesn't even
speak Spanish.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.288
Something is going on here.
I don't know what, but --

18:08.321 --> 18:10.791
The drug conviction
was over a year ago.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.293
Why do they want
to deport him now?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.899
I thought she wanted
to have sex.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.834
She said that
she pushed you off.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.536
Yes, one second
she was pushing me off,

18:22.569 --> 18:23.570
the next
she was kissing me.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.639
Did she tell you
to stop?

18:25.672 --> 18:26.907
She said no
a couple times, but --

18:26.940 --> 18:28.241
But what?

18:28.274 --> 18:31.311
It wasn't "no"
like "don't."

18:31.344 --> 18:34.915
It was more "no" like
"we shouldn't be doing this."

18:34.948 --> 18:37.818
What was the difference
in your mind?

18:37.851 --> 18:40.220
Well, we weren't
even on a date.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.922
We had just met
at a party,

18:41.955 --> 18:43.790
and I was
walking her home.

18:43.824 --> 18:44.925
She didn't --

18:44.958 --> 18:46.860
I felt
she wanted to have sex,

18:46.893 --> 18:48.929
but was conflicted
about it --

18:48.962 --> 18:50.764
about seeming
promiscuous.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.633
Did you force yourself
on her?

18:52.666 --> 18:53.734
No.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.368
I definitely
took the initiative,

18:55.401 --> 18:58.438
but I thought I was doing
something we both wanted.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.340
Now, after you had sex,
Mr. Smith,

19:00.373 --> 19:01.341
then what happened?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.343
We shared a ginger ale,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.445
we talked for a while,
and then I left.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.681
Was she crying or...

19:07.714 --> 19:08.649
No.

19:08.682 --> 19:10.250
Did she seem upset?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.351
No.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.820
I mean, she did
have some regret, but --

19:13.854 --> 19:14.921
What kind of regret?

19:14.955 --> 19:16.289
Well,
she just kept saying

19:16.322 --> 19:17.390
we really shouldn't
have done that,

19:17.423 --> 19:18.625
and that she's not
the type of girl

19:18.659 --> 19:20.193
who meets a man
and has sex,

19:20.226 --> 19:23.697
but she wasn't
angry at me.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.533
She seemed to be
more angry at herself.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.570
HELEN: Did she rip
her own clothes?

19:29.603 --> 19:31.437
No, I probably did that.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.540
What about the bruise
on her left wrist?

19:33.574 --> 19:34.808
If I did that,

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
I certainly never realized
I was hurting her.

19:36.677 --> 19:40.413
So when she said no,

19:40.446 --> 19:42.448
you figured
she didn't really mean it,

19:42.482 --> 19:44.518
and therefore,
you took the initiative?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.920
I guess that's right.

19:46.953 --> 19:50.757
So you bruised her wrist,
you tore her clothes off,

19:50.791 --> 19:52.458
she told you to stop,

19:52.492 --> 19:53.760
but in your mind,

19:53.794 --> 19:56.362
you figured
she really wanted it.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.832
Yes. A lot of women,

19:58.865 --> 20:00.000
they don't want to be
thought of as promiscuous,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.835
so they'll resist
a little,

20:01.868 --> 20:04.304
even though they really
want you to keep going.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.540
I see.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.775
I think we can end
with that answer.

20:08.809 --> 20:10.476
Nothing further.

20:10.511 --> 20:13.346
The witness may step down.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.751
Your Honor, at this time,

20:17.784 --> 20:20.253
we'd like to call
Lucy Hatcher to the stand.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.856
Objection. This witness has
no competence or foundation --

20:22.889 --> 20:24.858
This witness
was the turning point

20:24.891 --> 20:26.359
is Ms. Danzer's decision

20:26.392 --> 20:28.294
to falsely accuse
my client of rape,

20:28.328 --> 20:30.664
and I would like
to cross-examine her.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.732
Any communication
between Ms. Danzer

20:31.765 --> 20:32.966
and her counselor
is privileged.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.367
That privilege is outweighed

20:34.400 --> 20:35.769
by the defendant's right
to a fair trial.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.371
Only if Ms. Hatcher is aware
of exculpatory evidence.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.840
That's not the case here.

20:39.873 --> 20:41.908
Your Honor, that's exactly
what I'm looking to find out.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.009
This is a criminal trial.

20:43.043 --> 20:45.912
My client
faces serious charges.

20:45.946 --> 20:48.414
I should be allowed
to explore this issue.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.687
I'll see Ms. Hatcher
in chambers tomorrow morning.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.840
Okay...

21:13.874 --> 21:15.709
you were trying to tell me
something last night.

21:15.742 --> 21:19.279
I can't really talk
on the record, Lindsay.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.649
Off the record...

21:22.683 --> 21:25.519
if you'd like
to have a seat...

21:34.427 --> 21:37.731
Six weeks ago, an undercover
narcotics officer

21:37.764 --> 21:41.735
was shot and killed
in the backroom
of a Lawrence bar.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.436
Your client was there.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.939
Was he involved?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.708
I don't think so,

21:47.741 --> 21:49.776
but he saw who did it.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.445
The police believe
it was somebody

21:52.478 --> 21:55.849
Manny used to run with
during his drug days.

21:55.882 --> 21:59.085
Basically, your client's
a material witness

21:59.119 --> 22:00.654
who's not talking.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.657
So this is leverage.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.993
Seems so.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.697
And those drugs
were planted in his car

22:10.731 --> 22:12.766
to get leverage.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.636
That I don't know.
All I can say, Lindsay --

22:15.669 --> 22:18.438
The police are on a mission
to get the killer.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.507
Your guy
is caught in the middle.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.744
This is extortion.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.846
All the charges
are legitimate.

22:25.879 --> 22:28.815
The motive for bringing them
isn't really relevant.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.787
That's why I wanted
to settle this quickly,

22:33.820 --> 22:36.122
before all this stuff
went into motion.

22:36.156 --> 22:37.991
I can't really
interfere now.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.826
What's the offer?

22:39.860 --> 22:41.795
If he credibly
I. D. s the shooter,

22:41.828 --> 22:43.564
Manny will get
an "S" visa.

22:43.597 --> 22:45.799
He can stay in the country
indefinitely.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.934
What if he doesn't know
who the shooter is?

22:47.968 --> 22:51.471
He's got a problem.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.584
If rape counselors
can be forced to testify,

23:03.617 --> 23:05.118
what good will they be?

23:05.151 --> 23:07.187
-Perhaps not as --
-Victims will be afraid
to talk to me.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.855
I just need to know
the details

23:08.889 --> 23:10.524
of your first conversation

23:10.557 --> 23:12.158
so I can make a determination
as to whether --

23:12.192 --> 23:13.794
Why?

23:13.827 --> 23:19.099
How did you help her
decide she had been raped?

23:19.132 --> 23:21.835
That's privilege.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.742
I'm overriding
that privilege.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.511
What?

23:30.544 --> 23:32.646
I'm allowing
your testimony.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.719
I asked you if there
was something you knew
that I didn't.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.754
I didn't know that had
anything to do with this.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.690
-If you saw --
-I didn't. I was there,
I didn't see anything.

23:43.724 --> 23:46.026
Manny, this is not the time
to cover for a friend.

23:46.059 --> 23:48.461
I'm not.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.664
How can they
just do this?

23:50.697 --> 23:53.099
They're the I. N. S.
With a felony conviction,

23:53.133 --> 23:55.836
they can deport
a noncitizen, which you are.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.138
You will be gone.

23:58.171 --> 24:02.643
I can't prevent that.

24:02.676 --> 24:07.781
They're offering you
a visa if you cooperate.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.816
You saw it.

24:14.087 --> 24:16.623
Tell me.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.561
I can't.

24:20.594 --> 24:22.128
Manny, you're about
to be deported

24:22.162 --> 24:24.230
to a country where
you don't know anybody.

24:24.264 --> 24:26.667
The only person that can
help you here is you.

24:28.101 --> 24:30.871
This is
lawyer/client, right?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.105
Of course.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.642
You can't repeat nothing --
Not to anyone.

24:35.676 --> 24:37.978
Of course not.

24:40.614 --> 24:42.783
It was my brother.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.587
What?

24:48.755 --> 24:51.091
Your brother
was the shooter?

24:51.124 --> 24:53.259
Hector's a dealer,
Miss Dole.

24:53.293 --> 24:55.929
He runs an auto shop
as a cover.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.267
I can't give him up.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.071
If you want to stay
in this country...

25:06.607 --> 25:09.009
I can't give up
my brother.

25:17.718 --> 25:19.119
JIMMY: Why am I here?

25:19.152 --> 25:20.587
Well, if we have
more of an army,

25:20.621 --> 25:21.922
they'll take us
more seriously.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.990
You can just sit there
quiet.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.926
Look, I do have
work to do.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.293
They're due here
any second.

25:27.327 --> 25:31.598
The meeting should take
a half-hour, tops.

25:31.632 --> 25:32.899
Do you have
a squeal number?

25:32.933 --> 25:34.100
A what?

25:34.134 --> 25:36.269
A squeal number --
A number you'll take.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.271
Well, six figures
would be good.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.240
Listen, Eugene,
it's probably best

25:40.273 --> 25:42.175
if you kind of lead
the meeting.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.343
Lead the meeting?

25:43.376 --> 25:44.978
Just start things off.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.814
You know, how your firm is
prepared to try this case --

25:47.848 --> 25:49.850
My firm is not prepared
to try the case.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.317
You are scheduled
for trial next week.

25:51.351 --> 25:52.986
My firm
doesn't know the case,

25:53.019 --> 25:54.655
we will not
be trying it,

25:54.688 --> 25:55.989
and if you think
for a second --

25:56.022 --> 25:57.958
Uh, gentlemen.
Come right in.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.861
We're all ready
for you.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.163
That's John Rapherson.

26:03.196 --> 26:06.266
You know him?

26:06.299 --> 26:07.968
Do I know him?

26:10.403 --> 26:12.973
Mr. Bassett.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.609
Mr. Bassett.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.878
I did not convince Meredith
she had been raped.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.880
She came
to the Rape Crisis Center

26:19.913 --> 26:21.648
because she knew
she had been raped.

26:21.682 --> 26:23.617
Have you ever tried
to convince someone

26:23.650 --> 26:25.385
to press charges when
they hadn't been raped?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.353
No.

26:27.387 --> 26:28.955
According
to her testimony,

26:28.989 --> 26:30.090
Meredith decided
to press charges

26:30.123 --> 26:32.158
only after
talking to you.

26:32.192 --> 26:34.160
We talked
about the legal definition,

26:34.194 --> 26:35.762
and after
hearing the facts,

26:35.796 --> 26:37.764
I told her she should
speak to the police.

26:37.798 --> 26:40.033
So you gave her
the legal definition.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.034
Yes.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.636
Are you a lawyer?

26:42.669 --> 26:44.771
No, sir, I'm not.

26:44.805 --> 26:46.206
But you know enough
about the law

26:46.239 --> 26:47.407
to advise her
to call the police?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.910
Enough to give her
that option, yes.

26:49.943 --> 26:52.345
Who called the police --
You or Ms. Danzer?

26:52.378 --> 26:55.015
Actually, I did.
She was emotionally dis--

26:55.048 --> 26:56.316
You did.

26:56.349 --> 26:59.385
And you told the police
that she'd been raped?

26:59.419 --> 27:01.187
No, I told them I was
a rape crisis counselor,

27:01.221 --> 27:02.422
and that I had --

27:02.455 --> 27:04.224
Is it your testimony,
Ms. Hatcher,

27:04.257 --> 27:06.126
that Ms. Danzer came
to the conclusion

27:06.159 --> 27:07.293
that she was raped

27:07.327 --> 27:08.862
independently
of your influence?

27:08.895 --> 27:11.197
I can't really
know that, Mr. Tager.

27:11.231 --> 27:13.199
-Well, could she have?
-The witness has answered
she doesn't know.

27:13.233 --> 27:14.334
Withdrawn.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.970
When a person
is sexually assaulted,

27:17.003 --> 27:19.806
is this something
that she gets over easily

27:19.840 --> 27:20.941
with counseling?

27:20.974 --> 27:22.342
Of course not.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.244
In fact,
some of these victims

27:24.277 --> 27:26.813
carry the trauma with them
for a long time, do they not?

27:26.847 --> 27:28.949
Some the rest
of their lives.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.216
Many are angry.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.018
Would that be consistent
with your testimony?

27:32.052 --> 27:33.954
Yes.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.221
Have you ever been
sexually assaulted,

27:35.255 --> 27:36.256
Ms. Hatcher?

27:36.289 --> 27:37.991
HELEN: Objection.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.426
Goes to bias,
your honor.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.163
I'll allow it.

27:47.968 --> 27:50.270
Have you ever been
sexually assaulted?

27:58.779 --> 28:00.280
Yes.

28:00.313 --> 28:02.282
Your dentist
molested you

28:02.315 --> 28:04.851
while you were
under anesthesia.

28:04.885 --> 28:07.020
Yes.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.089
And the superintendent
at your apartment

28:09.122 --> 28:11.925
secretly installed cameras,
and he photographed you.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.426
Your honor, this has
no probative value.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.261
I'm allowing it,
Ms. Gamble.

28:15.295 --> 28:16.830
Please sit down.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.832
Truthfully, Ms. Hatcher,

28:18.865 --> 28:21.234
when you decided to become
a rape crisis counselor,

28:21.267 --> 28:24.505
is it possible that
your own anger was in play?

28:24.538 --> 28:26.740
It had nothing
to do with that.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.074
Nothing at all?

28:28.108 --> 28:29.876
No.

28:40.921 --> 28:42.789
You've seen
the discovery.

28:42.823 --> 28:45.526
The doctors have cited
Reflexin as the cause.

28:45.559 --> 28:48.261
Look, I'm not a scientist.
None of us is here,

28:48.294 --> 28:50.163
so it wouldn't make
much sense

28:50.196 --> 28:51.965
for us to debate
liability.

28:51.998 --> 28:55.368
Our client has directed us
not to settle.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.972
I suspect your client
doesn't really want a trial.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.074
Actually, Mr. Young,
in this case, they do.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.510
There's nothing better
than a trial sometimes

29:03.544 --> 29:05.946
to send the message
that you won't settle out,

29:05.979 --> 29:07.447
and this one presents

29:07.480 --> 29:10.851
a pretty risk-free
opportunity in their minds.

29:10.884 --> 29:12.218
You're here.

29:12.252 --> 29:14.154
Obviously,
you've got a number.

29:14.187 --> 29:18.324
Well, the number,
I'm afraid, is zero.

29:18.358 --> 29:22.295
We're here to satisfy ourselves
that it's the correct number.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.798
We just beat the EPA
for over $30 million

29:24.831 --> 29:26.967
on injuries that weren't
even as bad.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.535
They beat the EPA,
Mr. Bassett.

29:28.569 --> 29:31.237
Now, while I salute
your last-minute ingenuity

29:31.271 --> 29:33.840
in signing them up
for shock value,

29:33.874 --> 29:36.376
we know who opposing counsel
really is.

29:36.409 --> 29:39.980
My firm is very prepared
to be involved here.

29:40.013 --> 29:42.415
This is complex
product liability,

29:42.448 --> 29:45.118
and however impressive
your talent,

29:45.151 --> 29:48.254
there's no way you could
conceivably be ready

29:48.288 --> 29:50.256
to try this
by next week.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.258
Mr. Bassett will have to
lead this charge,

29:52.292 --> 29:53.960
whether he wants to
or not.

29:53.994 --> 29:54.995
We'll get a continuance.

29:55.028 --> 29:57.130
He's gotten six of them.

29:57.163 --> 30:01.201
The judge indicated
this last one was final.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.402
We're very sorry

30:02.435 --> 30:04.404
for the young girl's
difficulties,

30:04.437 --> 30:09.275
but we maintain our client
did not cause them.

30:09.309 --> 30:13.146
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with us.

30:22.022 --> 30:25.025
The man who just walked
out of this room

30:25.058 --> 30:29.996
is one of the top three
civil litigators in Boston.

30:32.198 --> 30:35.301
Are you ready to try
this case against him?

30:40.340 --> 30:44.177
How can they just remove
a person from a country?

30:44.210 --> 30:47.413
Just because I forgot to file
some adoption papers?

30:47.447 --> 30:51.117
They're convinced he knows
who shot this police officer.

30:51.151 --> 30:53.086
And what did he say?

30:53.119 --> 30:55.355
He says he didn't
see anything.

30:57.591 --> 30:59.526
Can't you go to federal court
and try to undo this?

30:59.560 --> 31:01.494
I'm going in this afternoon.

31:01.528 --> 31:04.531
I've scheduled a hearing
with the judge.

31:04.565 --> 31:07.333
But if I lose that,
they'll take him.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.170
He'll be on a plane
to Colombia.

31:10.203 --> 31:13.306
If he did see something,
maybe you two

31:13.339 --> 31:17.310
can convince him
to reveal what he can.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.913
It may be his only chance.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.616
We'll talk to him.

31:22.649 --> 31:26.319
I appreciate that.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.589
I'd gone to the hospital
because I had bruising.

31:28.622 --> 31:31.324
-From?
-Having sex.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.359
And the doctor
who treated me,

31:33.393 --> 31:36.597
I guess he was concerned
that maybe I'd been assaulted.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.065
-Had you been?
-No.

31:39.099 --> 31:41.301
I guess it was pretty rough,

31:41.334 --> 31:44.070
but it was
totally consensual.

31:44.104 --> 31:46.139
Did you talk
to Lucy Hatcher?

31:46.172 --> 31:47.473
Yes.

31:47.508 --> 31:49.576
And did you tell her
that the sex was consensual?

31:49.610 --> 31:53.046
-Yes.
-And how did she respond?

31:53.079 --> 31:55.215
She tried to convince me
that I'd been raped.

31:55.248 --> 31:56.617
She wanted
to call the cops.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.585
I kept telling her
it wasn't a rape,

31:58.619 --> 32:00.954
but she just didn't want
to accept that.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.656
Thank you, Cindy.

32:02.689 --> 32:04.591
Yours.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.296
Have you ever needed
to be hospitalized

32:10.330 --> 32:12.966
after having
consensual sex before?

32:12.999 --> 32:14.635
No.

32:14.668 --> 32:19.506
You filed
a police report, didn't you?

32:19.540 --> 32:22.342
Only because Lucy Hatcher
convinced me to.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.310
She's the one
who pushed it.

32:24.344 --> 32:25.712
The rape counselor,

32:25.746 --> 32:27.480
the woman who you
voluntarily talked to

32:27.514 --> 32:29.282
about what happened
that night...

32:29.315 --> 32:30.350
I wasn't raped.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.518
Yet when a doctor
asked you

32:31.552 --> 32:32.553
if you wanted to see
a rape counselor,

32:32.586 --> 32:34.655
you said yes,
didn't you?

32:34.688 --> 32:36.690
Yes.

32:36.723 --> 32:40.160
Nothing further.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.328
JUDGE: The witness
may step down.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.433
She was raped, Helen.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.769
It was total date rape.

32:48.802 --> 32:51.705
Either she's too ashamed
or she's in denial.

32:51.738 --> 32:54.374
I never convinced her
to file a report.

32:54.407 --> 32:55.676
All right, Lucy.

32:55.709 --> 32:57.477
Can't you put me back
up there to impeach her?

32:57.511 --> 32:59.713
It won't do us any good.

33:13.326 --> 33:16.262
The movers will pick up
the files by 3:00.

33:16.296 --> 33:18.632
Okay.

33:18.665 --> 33:21.334
I could sure use
a second chair at the trial

33:21.367 --> 33:22.736
if you're interested.

33:22.769 --> 33:27.107
Harland, I don't know
that I'd do you much good.

33:27.140 --> 33:29.342
I could get you
up to speed.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.645
I just can't.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.213
Sorry.

33:33.246 --> 33:36.149
Yeah.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.752
Uh, anyway,
I-I hope you don't mind,

33:38.785 --> 33:40.821
I scheduled a meeting here
with the client.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.723
I didn't know how long
we'd be tied up

33:42.756 --> 33:44.725
trying to settle.
If I could just

33:44.758 --> 33:46.326
borrow the conference room

33:46.359 --> 33:49.530
for another half-hour
or so...

33:55.301 --> 33:57.170
Sure.

33:59.205 --> 34:02.676
Three days later
she cries rape,

34:02.709 --> 34:05.679
after meeting
with this Lucy Hatcher,

34:05.712 --> 34:08.281
who convinced her
to cry rape,

34:08.313 --> 34:12.152
a rape counselor who had
been victimized herself,

34:12.185 --> 34:14.353
who admitted herself
that she didn't know

34:14.387 --> 34:16.089
whether she influenced

34:16.121 --> 34:19.659
Meredith Danzer's decision
to call the police or not.

34:19.693 --> 34:22.563
Meredith told you that
prior to her meeting

34:22.596 --> 34:25.565
with Ms. Hatcher,
she was confused

34:25.599 --> 34:28.501
about whether
she had been raped.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.304
If the so-called victim
is confused,

34:31.337 --> 34:32.773
ladies and gentlemen,

34:32.806 --> 34:35.609
of course you have
reasonable doubt.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.213
Meredith sought out
a rape counselor.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.283
Lucy Hatcher
didn't go to her.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.851
Her wrists were bruised.

34:45.886 --> 34:48.722
Her clothes were ripped.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.290
She said no.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.393
She tried to push
Benjamin Smith off.

34:53.426 --> 34:55.829
He pinned her legs
with his knees

34:55.862 --> 34:57.764
and forced himself in her.

34:57.798 --> 35:00.767
That is rape,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:00.801 --> 35:04.304
It doesn't matter how many
days later it is reported.

35:04.337 --> 35:09.610
Nonconsensual sex by force
is rape.

35:09.643 --> 35:11.778
All these cases
involve discretion,

35:11.812 --> 35:13.213
and it's an abuse,

35:13.246 --> 35:14.447
Throwing this kid
out of the country

35:14.480 --> 35:15.849
on a year-old
drug conviction.

35:15.882 --> 35:17.651
You know we have authority
on this matter, Ms. Dole.

35:17.684 --> 35:20.220
I'm not challenging
your authority.

35:20.253 --> 35:21.888
He was adopted
at the age of one.

35:21.922 --> 35:23.757
He's not from a foreign nation.
He's from here.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.627
It doesn't quite smell right,
I grant you,

35:26.660 --> 35:29.329
but the discretion
you speak of, Ms. Dole,

35:29.362 --> 35:30.496
is very wide.

35:30.531 --> 35:32.599
They're using this
to extort testimony.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.400
You cannot leverage
deportation.

35:34.434 --> 35:36.903
Whatever this country
is about, it can't be that.

35:36.937 --> 35:38.772
Don't run him up the flagpole
as a model citizen.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.841
Well, he pretty much
is a model citizen.

35:40.874 --> 35:42.776
Then he should perform
his civic duty

35:42.809 --> 35:44.244
and tell the government
who killed the police officer.

35:44.277 --> 35:45.779
You don't know
that he saw anything.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.347
He was in
a 12x20-foot room.

35:47.380 --> 35:48.715
But that doesn't mean
that he saw any--

35:48.749 --> 35:50.216
If you're gonna be
disingenuous, don't cry foul.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.519
All right.

35:52.553 --> 35:54.521
I'm not going
to deny the removal petition.

35:54.555 --> 35:56.389
Your honor, please.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.491
It sounds to me
like your client's fate

35:58.525 --> 36:00.761
is in his own hands,
counsel.

36:00.794 --> 36:04.364
Get him to accept
their offer.

36:04.397 --> 36:06.900
Being in Colombia,

36:06.933 --> 36:09.536
it's better
than Hector doing life.

36:09.570 --> 36:11.237
What will you do there?

36:11.271 --> 36:14.675
No family, no friends.
You can't even speak Spanish.

36:14.708 --> 36:16.677
And, Manny,
understand this --

36:16.710 --> 36:19.379
You can never come back here,
not even on a tourist visa.

36:19.412 --> 36:21.281
Maybe I can sneak back in.

36:21.314 --> 36:23.283
And if you're caught doing that,
you could get 20 years,

36:23.316 --> 36:24.718
after which
they'll deport you again.

36:24.751 --> 36:27.554
I know you love
your brother very much,

36:27.588 --> 36:30.390
but this is too big
a sacrifice.

36:30.423 --> 36:33.527
My advice,

36:33.560 --> 36:35.295
tell the police
what you know.

36:35.328 --> 36:36.296
I can't.

36:36.329 --> 36:38.431
It would kill my mother.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.966
Losing you will hurt
your mother more than --

36:40.000 --> 36:42.268
You don't understand.

36:44.905 --> 36:48.575
It would kill my mother.

36:50.777 --> 36:52.613
What are you talking about?

36:52.646 --> 36:56.617
Hector says if I tell,

36:56.650 --> 36:59.419
he'll have her killed.

37:01.755 --> 37:03.456
And he'd do it, Ms. Dole.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.992
You don't know how ruthless
he can be.

37:06.026 --> 37:09.462
Your brother would --
would kill your mother,

37:09.495 --> 37:10.731
his mother if --

37:10.764 --> 37:13.433
He says he would.

37:13.466 --> 37:17.051
And from what I know
and from what I've seen...

37:20.373 --> 37:22.909
I'm not sure he wouldn't.

37:35.055 --> 37:37.524
JUDGE: Will the defendant
please rise?

37:43.063 --> 37:45.799
Madame foreperson,
has the jury reached a verdict?

37:45.832 --> 37:47.768
We have, your honor.

37:47.801 --> 37:50.937
What say you?

37:50.971 --> 37:53.840
Commonwealth vs. Smith
on the charge of rape,

37:53.874 --> 37:55.576
we find the defendant
Benjamin Smith

37:55.609 --> 37:57.043
not guilty.

37:57.077 --> 37:59.880
JUDGE: Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

37:59.913 --> 38:02.783
You are dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

38:02.816 --> 38:05.451
The defendant is free to go.
We're adjourned.

38:05.485 --> 38:07.921
(judge pounds gavel)

38:16.429 --> 38:18.331
I'm sorry.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.733
You did your best.

38:19.766 --> 38:21.735
And so did you, Meredith.

38:21.768 --> 38:24.671
You were very courageous
coming in here.

38:24.705 --> 38:26.406
Thank you.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.842
If there's any way
I can help you...

38:28.875 --> 38:30.711
Thanks.

38:30.744 --> 38:33.947
I'd better go.

38:50.063 --> 38:53.634
I never told her to lie
or say anything --

38:53.667 --> 38:55.101
I know you didn't.

38:55.135 --> 39:00.473
I don't think
I steered her.

39:00.507 --> 39:01.875
I don't think I did.

39:01.908 --> 39:05.411
I'm sure you didn't mean to
if you did.

39:05.445 --> 39:09.750
But if you did...

39:09.783 --> 39:13.486
It's the toughest part
of my job, Luce,

39:13.520 --> 39:17.123
and I make up my mind
what the right result should be,

39:17.157 --> 39:19.660
and I'm tempted to steer
my witnesses

39:19.693 --> 39:21.662
to accomplish that result.

39:23.697 --> 39:27.100
It's the toughest part of my job
to resist that.

39:29.102 --> 39:32.939
It might be a difficult thing
for you in your job, too.

39:45.552 --> 39:47.654
Oh. May I help you?

39:47.688 --> 39:50.657
I'm looking
for Harland Bassett.

39:50.691 --> 39:53.860
Oh, Christine, hello.

39:53.894 --> 39:55.461
Hi, Annie.

39:55.495 --> 39:57.197
How'd we do?

39:57.230 --> 40:00.567
Well, didn't get the number
I want yet.

40:00.601 --> 40:02.068
Um, Eugene,

40:02.102 --> 40:04.938
this is Christine
and Annie Mullin, our clients.

40:04.971 --> 40:06.439
Hello.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.210
Hi, Annie.
I'm Eugene Young.

40:10.243 --> 40:12.012
Hello.

40:12.045 --> 40:13.547
How you doing?

40:13.580 --> 40:15.916
I'm fine.

40:15.949 --> 40:17.784
What did we get?

40:17.818 --> 40:21.454
Well, they didn't want
to settle at all.

40:22.623 --> 40:25.759
What does that mean?

40:25.792 --> 40:30.664
It means, sweetie,
we're going to go to trial.

40:30.697 --> 40:32.999
And you're going to beat them?

40:33.033 --> 40:37.504
Well, it'll be tough,

40:37.538 --> 40:39.506
but, uh, you know...

40:39.540 --> 40:42.208
We're going to try, Annie.

40:42.242 --> 40:45.445
Harland.

40:51.184 --> 40:53.186
That drug did this to her?

40:53.219 --> 40:54.621
Every bit of it.

40:54.655 --> 40:57.490
Six months ago
she was completely healthy.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.162
Get your files
back into that room.

41:02.195 --> 41:04.631
Yes, sir.

41:09.202 --> 41:11.772
Annie...

41:11.805 --> 41:14.575
you up for a fight?

41:14.608 --> 41:17.277
Yes.

41:17.310 --> 41:20.046
You tough enough to
take on the drug company?

41:21.314 --> 41:23.917
I'll be as tough
as I need to be.

41:27.821 --> 41:30.691
That's what I want to hear?

41:34.027 --> 41:37.531
Is there any way
to reverse it?

41:37.564 --> 41:40.567
I don't think so.
I'll keep trying.

41:40.601 --> 41:43.604
When would he be deported?

41:43.637 --> 41:46.272
A week, maybe two.

41:50.076 --> 41:52.679
When my sister died,

41:52.713 --> 41:57.918
I promised myself
I would take care of him,

41:57.951 --> 42:01.755
that I would love him
as my own.

42:03.957 --> 42:06.760
Well, you've certainly
done that.

42:09.229 --> 42:12.999
I'd appreciate it
if you would keep working.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.635
Whatever...

42:14.668 --> 42:16.703
Okay.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.978
I'm sorry, Mrs. Guzman.

42:27.313 --> 42:28.782
Yeah.

42:33.319 --> 42:35.155
Good night.

42:58.378 --> 42:59.913
I heard.

42:59.946 --> 43:03.183
I just came from Manny.

43:03.216 --> 43:05.986
Thanks for everything
you did.

43:07.888 --> 43:09.055
Sure.

43:35.348 --> 43:38.251
â™ª (theme)

44:01.207 --> 44:02.375
You stinker!
