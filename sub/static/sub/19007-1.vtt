00:45.979 --> 00:48.607
You got him! You got him!

00:49.682 --> 00:51.240
Sit down. Get down.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.154
We ain't never going to find
that damn little redskin.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.122
When I do, I'm going to scalp him.

00:58.191 --> 00:59.180
Go.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.225
The little Injun's somewhere.

01:03.296 --> 01:04.854
Get down.

01:04.931 --> 01:08.389
There's the Reid place.
Come on, we're missing it.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.436
The ranch.

01:10.503 --> 01:11.629
The ranch!

01:11.704 --> 01:13.331
Dad!

01:13.406 --> 01:15.567
Ma! Dad!

01:30.457 --> 01:31.754
Dad!

01:31.825 --> 01:32.814
Ma!

01:35.195 --> 01:36.389
No!

01:38.364 --> 01:39.991
Ma! Ma!

01:44.304 --> 01:45.669
Ma!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.234
Ma!

01:53.680 --> 01:55.238
Ma! Ma!

01:55.315 --> 01:57.681
Ma!

01:57.750 --> 02:00.742
Ma! Ma!

02:05.458 --> 02:06.425
Ma.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.857
Ma.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.055
Ma.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.665
Oh, Ma. Why did you...

02:18.738 --> 02:21.263
Why did you have to die?

02:50.503 --> 02:54.439
Though we cannot see
those that are dear to us

02:54.507 --> 02:57.908
does not mean that they
are no longer with us.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.605
Keep your parents alive within you,

03:00.680 --> 03:03.148
and their spirits will never die.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.409
While you are here,

03:06.486 --> 03:09.216
do not stand apart.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.053
Follow the Indian way.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.093
Be one of us.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.653
Tonto will teach you.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.791
<i>The legend started simply,</i>

03:22.869 --> 03:25.770
<i>just a boy without a home.</i>

03:25.838 --> 03:27.601
<i>Taken in by Indians,</i>

03:27.674 --> 03:30.768
<i>but still pretty much alone.</i>

03:30.843 --> 03:33.812
<i>He had to struggle with strange customs</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:36.747
<i>and his own fears from within.</i>

03:36.816 --> 03:39.944
<i>He learned the wisdom of the forest.</i>

03:40.019 --> 03:43.045
<i>He learned the ways of the wind.</i>

03:47.026 --> 03:50.154
I recognize my familiar voice

03:50.230 --> 03:54.496
as a truth bearer that tells me what to do

03:54.567 --> 03:56.501
and what is just

03:56.569 --> 03:58.901
and which trail to follow...

04:00.707 --> 04:03.005
the trail of justice.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.241
Dan? Dan!

04:38.311 --> 04:40.472
Hey, John. Johnny.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.115
Oh, I knew you'd come.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.379
Anyway, Johnny, it's all arranged.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.516
You're gonna go stay
with Aunt Martha in Detroit.

04:53.593 --> 04:57.154
Please, Dan, let me
stay with you, please.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.863
I belong here.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.326
From this moment,

05:29.395 --> 05:31.295
wherever you go,

05:31.364 --> 05:32.991
whatever you do,

05:33.066 --> 05:35.967
you will always be <i>kemo sabe.</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:42.334
Trusted friend.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.507
Whoa!

07:23.843 --> 07:25.333
Damn dust.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.936
10 to 1 we don't make Del Rio tonight.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.106
Where you want these at?

07:35.755 --> 07:36.779
Wait for what?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.927
That's worth waiting for, all right.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.603
Are you going to Del Rio?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.079
Sure going to try, ma'am.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.378
Need help?

08:04.450 --> 08:06.111
Thank you. I'll manage.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.318
Get on up the road! Come on, boys!

08:15.394 --> 08:16.861
You manage very well.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.128
Would one of you gentlemen
please change places with me?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.464
I can't read riding backwards.

08:56.536 --> 09:01.132
I've been in this seat
for three days now, lady.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.607
It's warm and lucky.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.644
I beg your pardon.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.635
Here.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.880
Thank you.

09:13.953 --> 09:18.049
John. John Reid.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.682
Thank you, Mr. Reid.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.271
She's a wonderful writer, isn't she?

09:36.342 --> 09:37.570
Are you familiar with her?

09:37.643 --> 09:39.975
Well, actually,
I prefer <i>Century of Dishonor.</i>

09:40.046 --> 09:41.673
I haven't read it.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.476
Well, you should.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.652
You don't ever go blind. Never.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.220
Dark eyeglasses.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.129
Solar spectacles!

10:01.200 --> 10:03.100
This is why I came out west.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.932
To manufacture, you know?

10:05.004 --> 10:07.234
You're a man of vision, sir.

10:07.306 --> 10:08.432
Vision?

10:08.507 --> 10:09.974
Very good.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.737
So how about you, young man?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.076
I'm an attorney. I'm starting my practice.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.375
A lawyer.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.380
If we didn't have lawyers,
we wouldn't have crooks.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.920
You know, I think you're
gonna sell a pair of these

10:24.991 --> 10:26.322
to everybody in Texas.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.984
<i>Jal</i> I will. I will.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.994
American opportunity, Mr. Reid.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.529
Take advantage.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.826
What the hell was that?

10:34.900 --> 10:35.889
Indians?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.663
Road agents!

10:37.737 --> 10:39.329
Here's what we're getting paid for, kid!

10:40.339 --> 10:41.499
Get the horse!

10:41.574 --> 10:42.836
Get up in there!

10:42.908 --> 10:44.899
- I can't!
- Get their goddamn horse!

10:44.977 --> 10:48.037
Indians! Indiana!

10:48.114 --> 10:50.548
Get on up the road!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.923
What the hell is he doing?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.754
- He can't outrun them.
- But he's gonna try.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.487
He could get us killed.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.366
Get up!

11:16.542 --> 11:17.531
Up!

11:38.764 --> 11:39.788
Giddyup!

11:46.072 --> 11:47.699
Get on, boy!

12:09.495 --> 12:11.292
Do any of you gentlemen have a gun?

12:11.363 --> 12:12.352
Yes, ma'am. I do.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.058
Well, use it, then!

12:14.133 --> 12:16.033
It's not my fight, lady.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.332
But it's mine. Give it to me!

12:18.404 --> 12:19.393
I'm not a coward.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.236
So much for American opportunity.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.563
Jump on it and stop it!

12:53.439 --> 12:56.101
Get up in there!

13:56.969 --> 13:58.800
Whoa!

13:58.871 --> 14:00.236
Whoa.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.173
Whoa! Whoa.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.641
Let's have the pouch.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.177
We ain't got no gold.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.837
We ain't got no cash box.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.312
The pouch!

14:09.381 --> 14:11.576
Hell, all I got is letters and packages.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.642
They ain't worth it.
Them's government papers.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.483
- Let's go.
- What? Just leave them here?

14:16.555 --> 14:18.580
- Them's our orders.
- Who's going to tell?

14:18.657 --> 14:21.057
- Well, make it fast.
- All right.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.232
- Come on!
- I'm hurrying.

14:29.301 --> 14:32.202
What the hell are you doing in there?

14:32.271 --> 14:33.795
Nothing, nothing! Nothing.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.272
Nothing don't take that long.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.072
But she might.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.565
Kill him! Kill the bandit!

15:00.633 --> 15:02.897
- No!
- Do it!

15:02.968 --> 15:04.230
No!

15:13.846 --> 15:16.178
I would like to thank you.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.286
Well, you can thank me
by telling me your name.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.191
Amy. Amy Striker.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.866
They held up the Overland!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.808
They held up the Overland!

15:45.878 --> 15:47.675
They held up the Overland!

15:47.746 --> 15:50.647
Everybody's been killed! They're all dead!

15:50.716 --> 15:53.378
<i>Del Rio was a town in trouble,</i>

15:53.452 --> 15:55.977
<i>a town with a gun in its back,</i>

15:56.055 --> 15:57.955
<i>plagued by crimes</i>
<i>that just wouldn't stop</i>

15:58.023 --> 16:01.117
<i>and cursed with a sheriff</i>
<i>who wore black.</i>

16:01.193 --> 16:03.753
<i>So you'd think they'd be suspicious,</i>

16:03.829 --> 16:06.354
<i>but simple folks rarely are.</i>

16:06.432 --> 16:08.366
<i>They're willing to trust their law</i>

16:08.434 --> 16:10.402
<i>to just about any man who wears a star.</i>

16:10.469 --> 16:11.868
Whoa.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.098
Here's the sheriff.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.839
They killed Shotgun
and one of the passengers.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.676
Amy! Amy!

16:22.748 --> 16:25.216
There was five of 'em.
This is what's left.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.945
Oh, Amy. Thank God.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.748
Two of them, huh?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.948
Well, they'll each hang twice.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.617
They wore the gray hoods, Sheriff.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.592
Cavendish gang.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.492
They's after these land grants.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.225
Come on.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.893
What's going to happen
to those two outlaws?

16:42.968 --> 16:45.300
They're gonna take them
to San Anton'

16:45.371 --> 16:47.339
Do you need a deposition?

16:47.406 --> 16:48.737
I don't know.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.901
You got one you want to get rid of?

16:55.948 --> 16:58.712
Oh, Mr. Reid. I'm Lucas Striker.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.773
My uncle.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.686
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.983
Amy told me what you did.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.922
I just can't thank you enough.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.790
Why, if anything happened to her...

17:09.862 --> 17:11.329
Well, uh, you know,

17:11.396 --> 17:13.887
your niece was very
courageous, sir.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.157
She never compromised an inch.

17:18.737 --> 17:22.502
Perhaps you might join us
for supper tonight?

17:22.574 --> 17:24.940
Thank you. I'd like to, but I can't.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.002
I have to be at the ranger
post before dark.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.707
Oh, are you joining the rangers?

17:29.782 --> 17:31.147
No, sir. My brother.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.274
I see.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.023
You shouldn't have come.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.683
You've got an education.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.628
You're a lawyer, for Christ's sakes!

17:45.697 --> 17:47.961
You got a chance
to make something out of your life,

17:48.033 --> 17:49.660
but this is not the place.

17:53.038 --> 17:56.599
Dan, what's happened?
I mean, what's wrong?

18:02.614 --> 18:05.082
You just don't understand.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.742
These are tough times.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.720
John, I got enough hurt in my life

18:09.788 --> 18:12.814
without having to worry about you, too.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.225
When I was 10 years old,

18:18.297 --> 18:20.424
you sent me away to learn,

18:20.499 --> 18:21.989
and I learned.

18:22.067 --> 18:26.094
But the most important thing I learned
was that I belong here.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.867
You don't understand.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.704
It's still a frontier.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.506
It forces you to make sacrifices,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.740
to make choices.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.839
Your heart can't tell you what to do.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.008
Your gut tells you.

18:45.557 --> 18:49.152
Dan...

18:49.228 --> 18:51.025
we're the last of the Reids.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.924
You're my brother.

18:58.670 --> 19:03.164
Can't you understand
that you don't belong here?

19:06.712 --> 19:10.113
Dan, I've come home,

19:10.182 --> 19:15.017
and my gut tells me that I'm going to stay.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.693
John.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.771
One day she just packed up,
took Danny back to Richmond.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.372
Well, maybe she'll change her mind.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.882
No.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.886
Not till we make it safe out here.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.390
Safe so a man can raise a family

19:52.457 --> 19:54.857
and provide for them.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.360
But I don't know.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.295
This territory is endless.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.924
That just may be impossible.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.936
Bastards come out of nowhere, strike...

20:06.004 --> 20:08.370
and just disappear.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.068
I don't even know where they hole up.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.111
Who's that?

20:13.178 --> 20:14.406
The Cavendish gang.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.037
Cavendish?

20:16.114 --> 20:19.015
They're the ones who robbed the stage.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.415
Cavendish don't rob stages.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.885
Cavendish robs ranches.

20:22.955 --> 20:27.289
They've been grabbing land,
driving the owners off,

20:27.359 --> 20:31.659
robbing, killing, burning.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.220
Who is this Cavendish?

20:33.298 --> 20:35.528
Butch Cavendish.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.159
Butch for butcher.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.694
Major in the Union Army,
dishonorably discharged.

20:40.772 --> 20:44.765
Grant court-martialed him
right after the Battle of Chattanooga.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.676
Now he's heading
an outlaw army in Texas.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.045
Well...

20:51.116 --> 20:52.674
you know you'll get him.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.050
You going to see him
when he comes out here?

20:56.121 --> 20:57.247
Cavendish?

20:57.322 --> 20:59.381
Grant.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.358
Grant's coming out here.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.223
He's going to hunt buffalo,

21:03.295 --> 21:05.286
make speeches.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.697
Everybody in the whole town's
going to turn out there

21:08.767 --> 21:10.325
and wave little flags at him.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.303
Me?

21:13.372 --> 21:15.431
I'd like to piss on him.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.840
He's the President of the United States.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.470
He's a liar and a drunk.

21:21.546 --> 21:24.606
Piss on the President.
Piss on the Cabinet.

21:24.683 --> 21:28.517
They ain't going to help
us out here, you know.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.020
In Texas,

21:30.088 --> 21:32.556
robbers are outlaws.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.525
In Washington...

21:35.594 --> 21:37.255
robbers are elected.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.626
Ain't that right?

21:41.233 --> 21:42.530
Huh, little brother?

21:43.835 --> 21:45.860
John?

21:48.006 --> 21:49.769
Well, it is.

21:53.178 --> 21:56.238
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

22:01.019 --> 22:03.510
<i>Butch Cavendish lived undisturbed,</i>

22:03.588 --> 22:05.613
<i>waging his private war,</i>

22:05.691 --> 22:07.682
<i>and men who made mistakes</i>

22:07.759 --> 22:10.557
<i>were simply men he could not afford.</i>

22:10.629 --> 22:13.189
<i>Some say he was a monster,</i>

22:13.265 --> 22:16.132
<i>and others called him mad.</i>

22:16.201 --> 22:18.601
<i>Let's just say Butch Cavendish</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:21.730
<i>was everything that's bad.</i>

22:29.214 --> 22:32.012
About-face!

22:35.587 --> 22:39.079
Dale Wesley Stillwell

22:39.157 --> 22:41.921
and Robert Edward Gattlin,

22:41.993 --> 22:44.928
it is the finding of this military tribunal

22:44.996 --> 22:47.658
that you are in violation
of the articles of war,

22:47.733 --> 22:50.293
and your undisciplinary conduct

22:50.369 --> 22:53.634
resulted in the failure
of a military objective.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.437
Therefore,

22:58.510 --> 23:01.308
it is the pronouncement
of this tribunal

23:01.380 --> 23:05.339
that you be executed
by firing squad forthwith.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.920
- Mr. Perlmutter.
- Sir?

23:10.989 --> 23:13.253
Carry out the orders of the tribunal.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.259
Yes, sir.

23:31.810 --> 23:32.799
Lock.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.510
And load.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.382
Major Cavendish, sir.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.456
What is it?

23:49.528 --> 23:53.055
Well, sir, it seems to me, sir,

23:53.131 --> 23:58.159
that they just did
what most men would've done.

23:58.236 --> 24:01.865
I have no room for
ordinary men, Mr. Wiatt.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.999
We are on a course that will alter

24:04.075 --> 24:05.599
the history of this country.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.440
Men who do not obey orders

24:07.512 --> 24:09.878
for the sake of their
own personal gains...

24:13.552 --> 24:17.818
are a clear and present
danger to my plan.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.652
Do I make myself understood?

24:20.992 --> 24:23.187
Yes, sir, you do.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.658
Proceed, Mr. Perlmutter.

24:26.731 --> 24:29.291
Yes, sir.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.664
Stevens.

24:30.735 --> 24:33.329
Assume the firing position!

24:36.308 --> 24:37.434
Ready.

24:38.877 --> 24:41.345
Aim.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.675
Fire!

24:55.760 --> 24:57.751
<i>¡Mira, miral</i>

25:32.764 --> 25:34.732
It's really exciting, isn't it?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.230
Dan, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.931
Come on.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.440
- Lucas.
- Hello, Captain.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.640
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.114
Good evening, Mr. Reid.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.048
Captain, this is my niece Amy.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.676
She's on her way to San Francisco.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.777
How do you do?

26:29.854 --> 26:32.118
Well, John's told me a lot about you.

26:34.559 --> 26:36.720
I read your article
in the paper this morning.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.387
Oh, did you like it?

26:38.463 --> 26:40.954
Well, it made me sound like a hero.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.060
I enjoyed your editorial
about Cavendish, Mr. Striker.

26:45.136 --> 26:46.296
Thank you.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.396
If more folks laid it on the table like you,

26:48.473 --> 26:49.565
we could put an end to him.

26:49.641 --> 26:50.767
We'll stop him, Captain.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.104
Which reminds me, I've got to get

26:52.177 --> 26:54.407
tomorrow's edition out.
So if you'll excuse me?

26:54.479 --> 26:55.468
Do you need me to help?

26:55.547 --> 26:57.412
Oh, no, Amy. Stay here
and have a good time.

26:57.482 --> 27:00.178
Gentlemen, good night.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.787
Nice party.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.291
Yes.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.953
Isn't it?

27:11.029 --> 27:13.463
Uh, yeah... yes, ma'am.

27:13.531 --> 27:16.056
All this talking makes me dry.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.726
It was very nice
to have met you, Miss Amy.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.793
Oh, it was my pleasure, Captain.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.180
Nice party.

27:30.248 --> 27:32.478
You said that already.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.745
I did, didn't I?

27:54.406 --> 27:55.566
I have a feeling

27:55.640 --> 27:58.871
you're going to be a very important lawyer.

27:58.943 --> 28:00.774
I just want to make sure

28:00.845 --> 28:03.405
the West has an honest
system of justice.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.678
Oh, you sound just like my uncle.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.418
Here.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.189
Oh, you remembered.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.958
<i>A Century of Dishonor.</i>

28:21.533 --> 28:22.966
Thank you.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.937
I'd like you to keep it.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.667
I will.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.539
Will you write me and tell me
how you like San Francisco?

28:32.610 --> 28:34.475
Yes, of course.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.912
Maybe you could...

28:36.981 --> 28:41.281
send some articles or stories
that you've written.

28:41.352 --> 28:43.149
Of course.

28:45.824 --> 28:49.157
So I guess this is good-bye.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.717
For now.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.141
Maybe we should go back.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.242
Amy, l...

29:14.319 --> 29:16.116
I think we should go back.

29:27.398 --> 29:30.231
Captain Reid! Captain Reid!

29:30.301 --> 29:31.393
Captain Reid!

29:36.141 --> 29:38.609
Hidalgo!

29:41.312 --> 29:42.870
What happened?

29:42.947 --> 29:45.438
<i>El periodico.</i>

29:45.517 --> 29:46.950
The <i>Dispatch.</i>

29:47.018 --> 29:49.213
Get the horses.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.311
<i>¡Ai, carambal</i>

30:08.706 --> 30:10.264
Amy, wait here.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.547
Uncle Lucas.

30:20.618 --> 30:22.643
Uncle Lucas!

30:26.558 --> 30:29.220
No. No.

30:29.294 --> 30:32.024
- Please, no.
- Amy, Amy.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.257
Uncle Lucas.

30:34.332 --> 30:39.565
All he lived for was his newspaper.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.070
- Collins!
- There's tracks, sir!

30:41.139 --> 30:44.631
Six riders, heading north.

30:44.709 --> 30:45.733
Mount up.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.278
I wish I had an answer for you, Amy.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.985
John, where the hell are you going?

31:00.058 --> 31:01.150
With you.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.751
Well, let's get 'em.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.492
Please come back.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.800
Well, this is about right.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.345
I got my best party shirt on
for something like this?

31:55.413 --> 31:57.347
Look at Lopez. Don't hear him griping.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.406
He had every swirling
<i>chiquita</i> in the place

31:59.484 --> 32:00.781
wanting to marry him.

32:02.153 --> 32:05.816
Now he's out here riding with us
for glory and God and Texas.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.420
Hey, Stephenson,

32:10.495 --> 32:12.827
why don't you swallow
that damn stinking cigar?

32:12.897 --> 32:14.831
Yeah, I could,

32:14.899 --> 32:16.560
but it sure keeps my nose warm.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.465
I'm beginning to strongly dislike

32:18.536 --> 32:20.094
this Cavendish fellow.

32:20.171 --> 32:22.036
Yeah. I wonder if he knows

32:22.106 --> 32:24.597
the rangers are riding right up his ass.

33:24.402 --> 33:25.664
A great place for a picnic.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.599
Where the hell are we?

33:30.675 --> 33:33.075
Bryant's Gap.

33:33.144 --> 33:36.079
Captain, you want
I should ride up ahead,

33:36.147 --> 33:37.614
take a look?

33:37.682 --> 33:39.149
Yeah, okay, Collins,

33:39.217 --> 33:40.980
but you watch yourself.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.747
Always do, Captain.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.701
Get over there, Tex.

34:00.772 --> 34:01.898
Good boy.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.685
Wait till you meet my kid.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.487
You're going to love him.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.654
Not if he's anything like you.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.197
Well, he is.

34:27.264 --> 34:28.425
Spitting damn image.

34:28.498 --> 34:29.487
Jerky?

34:29.567 --> 34:31.534
No, thanks.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.467
You don't know what you're missing.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.971
His mother's gonna let him

34:35.039 --> 34:36.768
come out and visit for Christmas.

34:36.841 --> 34:38.069
You really miss him, don't you?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.036
Yeah.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.876
Look, uh...

34:43.947 --> 34:47.384
if anything was ever to happen to me...

34:47.452 --> 34:50.909
I want you to check on him for me.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.353
Nothing's going to happen to you.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.721
If it was gonna happen, it would have
happened a long time ago.

34:54.792 --> 34:56.123
Yeah.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.222
Yeah, I suppose.

35:00.965 --> 35:04.628
But just the same, you know,
would you? In case?

35:04.702 --> 35:06.294
Sure.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.401
You know how a boy needs a father.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.523
Here.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.902
What's this for?

36:13.971 --> 36:15.268
It's for you.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.671
You can't be shooting
outlaws without it.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.676
You should know that.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.269
There's Collins.

36:32.490 --> 36:33.684
Mount up.

37:03.754 --> 37:05.415
Where is he now?

37:09.026 --> 37:10.493
Let's get the hell out of here.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.377
Ain't no pass here now!

37:37.455 --> 37:38.683
Go back!

37:38.756 --> 37:40.087
We got to get out the other way!

37:40.157 --> 37:41.681
The other way!

37:44.295 --> 37:46.957
Come on!

38:32.643 --> 38:33.769
John!

38:39.016 --> 38:41.211
Hi, kid.

38:45.222 --> 38:48.749
How do you like being a ranger?

38:48.826 --> 38:50.350
More than anything.

38:50.428 --> 38:51.793
Yeah, great life, ain't it?

38:54.799 --> 38:56.630
Homer!

38:56.701 --> 38:57.725
Homer!

38:59.870 --> 39:01.633
I've been a ranger longer
than you've been alive.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.202
Been in San Anton' with big Sam Houston.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.838
Fought alongside McCullough
in the Mexican War.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.439
Rode with Kit Carson and John Coffee Hays.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.041
All those years, kid, I learned one thing.

39:15.119 --> 39:16.211
What was that?

39:16.287 --> 39:18.482
It ain't the bullet that gets you.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.191
It's the fall.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.856
John! John!

39:29.233 --> 39:30.461
Dan!

39:33.904 --> 39:35.769
- Dan!
- Stay down, John!

39:51.288 --> 39:52.482
Dan.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.545
Dan.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.883
Dan.

39:58.095 --> 39:59.119
Dan.

39:59.196 --> 40:01.596
Oh. Oh, Dan.

40:02.767 --> 40:06.203
At least this time we were together.

40:06.270 --> 40:07.259
No.

40:08.773 --> 40:09.705
Weren't we?

40:09.774 --> 40:10.866
Dan.

40:10.941 --> 40:12.431
Weren't we, little brother?

40:12.510 --> 40:14.273
No, Dan.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.441
No!

40:18.516 --> 40:20.984
No!

40:33.330 --> 40:35.491
Pick up the hymn books, boys.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.227
It's all over.

40:47.912 --> 40:49.539
Collins.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.205
Yes, sir.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.049
Go down and check the bodies.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.648
Sir, couldn't you send
somebody else, sir?

41:01.725 --> 41:03.124
You rode with them.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.889
Well, yes, sir, I did, but...

41:06.931 --> 41:08.193
Sir.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.888
<i>One thing about that Cavendish,</i>

41:36.961 --> 41:39.589
<i>he knew how to set a trap.</i>

41:39.663 --> 41:41.654
<i>And he finished off the rangers</i>

41:41.732 --> 41:43.757
<i>that day in Bryant's Gap.</i>

41:46.170 --> 41:49.333
<i>And Collins had to check them all</i>

41:49.406 --> 41:51.271
<i>till Butch was satisfied.</i>

41:52.610 --> 41:56.011
<i>Dead men lying everywhere,</i>

41:56.080 --> 41:59.379
<i>and bloody brothers side by side.</i>

42:23.374 --> 42:24.898
It'd seem too coincidental

42:24.975 --> 42:26.840
if the only survivor wasn't wounded.

42:26.911 --> 42:29.402
Yes, sir, Major.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.381
Maybe they'll give you a medal.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.936
Dan. Dan!

45:54.785 --> 45:56.650
Rest.

46:05.529 --> 46:07.429
<i>Kemo sabe.</i>

46:11.902 --> 46:13.665
What?

46:13.737 --> 46:15.932
<i>Kemo sabe.</i>

46:22.980 --> 46:24.470
Tonto?

46:24.548 --> 46:26.413
Yes.

46:26.483 --> 46:29.418
<i>And Tonto recognized John Reid</i>

46:29.486 --> 46:31.613
<i>by the amulet he wore.</i>

46:31.688 --> 46:34.680
<i>But John had once saved Tonto's life,</i>

46:34.758 --> 46:37.249
<i>so this evened up the score.</i>

46:40.164 --> 46:42.291
<i>Tonto had to hide his friend</i>

46:42.366 --> 46:44.527
<i>and keep him out of town</i>

46:44.601 --> 46:47.661
<i>'cause if Butch had known</i>
<i>that one ranger lived,</i>

46:47.738 --> 46:50.707
<i>he was sure to hunt him down.</i>

46:52.376 --> 46:55.504
The white man has made
many promises to us,

46:55.579 --> 46:57.547
yet they keep only one.

46:57.614 --> 47:00.048
They promised to take
our land from us,

47:00.117 --> 47:02.108
and they took it.

47:02.186 --> 47:04.620
You see the suffering and the misery

47:04.688 --> 47:06.451
they bring to your people,

47:06.523 --> 47:10.619
yet you bring one to us
to nurse back to health.

47:10.694 --> 47:11.683
Tonto, why?

47:14.031 --> 47:17.296
Nobody has reason to fill
their hearts with hatred

47:17.367 --> 47:19.892
for the white man more than I.

47:19.970 --> 47:22.461
He's taken from me
my wife and my child,

47:22.539 --> 47:25.975
but the man I brought here
is my brother.

47:26.043 --> 47:29.069
And I will protect his life
with my own if I have to.

47:30.414 --> 47:31.540
And if I'm wrong

47:31.615 --> 47:35.073
and he proves to be an enemy,

47:35.152 --> 47:38.315
then I, Tonto, will decorate my lance

47:38.388 --> 47:39.685
with his white man's hair.

47:41.725 --> 47:43.625
But until that day comes,

47:43.694 --> 47:46.527
let him not be judged by his color,

47:46.597 --> 47:48.224
but by his heart

47:48.298 --> 47:50.892
as a man and a friend.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.318
<i>What is it that brings</i>
<i>two friends together</i>

48:19.396 --> 48:22.524
<i>or sends the waves to the sand?</i>

48:22.599 --> 48:25.033
<i>And what is it that drives</i>
<i>a creature of nature</i>

48:25.102 --> 48:28.560
<i>to reach out to the world of man?</i>

48:28.639 --> 48:31.574
<i>Just such a creature was</i>
<i>this great white horse,</i>

48:31.642 --> 48:34.372
<i>as wise and as wild as a runaway,</i>

48:34.444 --> 48:37.607
<i>and the moment John</i>
<i>first laid eyes on him,</i>

48:37.681 --> 48:40.115
<i>he swore he'd ride him someday.</i>

49:28.799 --> 49:31.063
Maybe you need a bigger target,

49:31.134 --> 49:33.295
like a sleeping buffalo.

49:34.304 --> 49:35.293
Try this.

49:37.841 --> 49:39.900
A silver bullet.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.774
It's more accurate.

49:55.826 --> 49:59.284
Tribal chiefs first used
silver on their arrows.

49:59.363 --> 50:03.060
It makes them fly longer and straighter.

50:03.133 --> 50:04.691
Silver is pure.

50:04.768 --> 50:07.066
It's been a symbol of justice and purity

50:07.137 --> 50:08.900
since the year of the sun.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.384
Well, good morning.

50:58.355 --> 50:59.549
Look at him.

51:07.297 --> 51:09.663
He shines like the moon.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.758
Like silver.

51:23.547 --> 51:25.208
Silver.

51:35.292 --> 51:37.487
Easy, boy.

51:42.732 --> 51:44.063
Silver.

51:46.503 --> 51:48.801
Whoa.

51:48.872 --> 51:51.397
Easy, boy.

51:51.475 --> 51:53.943
That's a boy.

51:56.046 --> 51:58.241
Easy, Silver.

52:01.718 --> 52:03.811
Whoa.

52:07.224 --> 52:08.623
Easy.

52:10.827 --> 52:12.419
Easy, boy.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.348
Whoa!

54:43.413 --> 54:45.074
Good boy.

55:38.301 --> 55:40.166
Whoa!

56:21.511 --> 56:22.978
When I found you,

56:23.046 --> 56:26.447
I was searching for the men
that raided my village.

56:26.516 --> 56:27.778
I seek right.

56:27.851 --> 56:32.185
I will not be herded like soldier's sheep
from pen to pen

56:32.255 --> 56:35.747
or issued my food and clothing
by government agents.

56:37.093 --> 56:40.790
I am man and am free
to die for what I feel.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.425
And the day might not be
many winter counts away

56:45.502 --> 56:47.026
when all men will be brothers.

56:47.103 --> 56:50.504
A new Indian nation
will come out of this time of change,

56:50.573 --> 56:53.804
strong and proud and united.

56:55.011 --> 56:57.946
Well, then, let brother
ride with brother.

57:04.487 --> 57:06.921
If I am to find Cavendish,

57:06.990 --> 57:11.393
I can no longer appear as John Reid.

57:11.461 --> 57:13.656
Cavendish and his men must think

57:13.730 --> 57:17.427
that all the rangers were
killed in the massacre,

57:17.500 --> 57:22.301
and only then will I be free
to avenge my brother's death.

57:25.608 --> 57:28.975
We will go back to Bryant's Gap

57:29.045 --> 57:32.139
and dig one more grave.

57:32.215 --> 57:34.115
John Reid will...

57:35.652 --> 57:39.179
be buried with his brother
and the rangers forever.

57:44.894 --> 57:46.987
I swear to you, Dan,

57:47.063 --> 57:49.657
no matter how long it takes,

57:49.732 --> 57:51.859
no matter where they are,

57:51.935 --> 57:53.562
I will find them.

57:55.705 --> 57:59.072
What Cavendish
and men like him owe you,

57:59.142 --> 58:01.110
they will pay in full.

58:02.812 --> 58:06.543
There will be justice in the West.

58:06.616 --> 58:10.143
To this, my brother, I pledge my life.

58:29.205 --> 58:31.673
Hi-yo, Silver!

59:31.067 --> 59:33.729
<i>Now John Reid was just a memory.</i>

59:33.803 --> 59:36.397
<i>The masked man</i>
<i>had taken his place.</i>

59:36.472 --> 59:39.305
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>his heart wasn't touched</i>

59:39.375 --> 59:41.741
<i>when he saw Amy Striker's face.</i>

59:41.811 --> 59:43.608
<i>Amy had stayed to do her uncle's work</i>

59:43.680 --> 59:46.114
<i>and to keep his dreams alive,</i>

59:46.182 --> 59:49.310
<i>but unless the masked man</i>
<i>could find Cavendish,</i>

59:49.385 --> 59:52.877
<i>true justice would never survive.</i>

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.821
You're too late, mister.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.291
Some old bar dog got all of my money.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.886
The brave survivor of Bryant's Gap.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.430
That's right.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:36.988
What was it like?

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.897
It was like hell.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.940
Cavendish?

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.442
I don't know who it was.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.481
Why are you wearing a mask?

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.779
Because I'm in hiding...

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.251
like you are.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.652
What are you getting at, mister?

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.350
I want you to take me to Cavendish.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.120
How would I know Cavendish?

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.161
You led the rangers to him.

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.459
And now you're going
to lead me to him.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.762
No, see, you got it all wrong.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.461
I'm a big hero around here.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.367
Isn't that right?

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:18.236
What did they promise you?

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.070
Was it money? Land?

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:27.873
What was worth having
your friends slaughtered?

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.383
You're crazy.

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.579
And I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:34.487
You know what I'm talking about.

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.024
Where is he?

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.223
I don't know Cavendish.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:42.764
Why did he set up the rangers?

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:59.914
I know what happened there.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:04.009
For Christ's sake, mister.
L... I can't.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.387
You can, and you will.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.952
Collins, tell me.

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.563
The train.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.156
What train?

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.395
The train. He wants the train.

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.686
The masked man.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.790
Looks like you're going to hang alone.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:04.675
Coal tender...

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.544
soldier's car,

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.084
club car,

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.245
presidential car.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.547
Are we clear, gentlemen?

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.091
Yes, sir.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:22.189
Whitloff and Richardson.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.459
Yes, sir.

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.043
Westlake.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:41.916
Eastman and Neeley.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:44.248
Yes, sir.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.912
Gentlemen,

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.819
the President.

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.919
- String him up!
- He was a hero!

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:58.694
That's no way for him to die
after what he went through!

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.599
Well, he's civilized for an Indian!

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.035
What kind of law do they understand?

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:04.572
Swift, short, and certain!

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.471
Let's string him up!

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.213
Wald's bringing them here.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.043
Just like he said.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:18.286
Hey, Crazy Horse, you're on your way
to the Happy Hunting Grounds.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:21.016
They look like a herd of buffalo.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.991
They're going to be tough to control.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.130
Order! Order!

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.931
Don't get in the way, Wiatt.
We're taking the Indian.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.835
- Now just step aside.
- Now, you listen to me.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:40.137
Two or three of you want to go in there
and get him, that's all right.

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:42.700
I don't want the rest of you
dirtying up the place.

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:47.544
You, you, and you, go get him.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.958
There's only one kind of good Indian.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:13.602
<i>I don't guess anyone stopped to ask</i>

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.940
<i>what Tonto was guilty of.</i>

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.139
<i>That didn't stop them</i>
<i>from wanting to see him</i>

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:20.512
<i>swinging high above.</i>

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.949
<i>But Tonto showed no sign of fear,</i>

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:26.011
<i>and he held onto a fervent hope</i>

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.453
<i>that the masked man</i>

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:30.014
<i>wouldn't let his blood brother hang</i>

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.287
<i>from the end of a rope.</i>

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.896
This is for Eddie Collins.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.539
<i>Those Cavendish boys</i>
<i>had been working real hard</i>

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.481
<i>going over each step of their plan.</i>

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:32.612
<i>Meanwhile, old Butch</i>
<i>was mighty disturbed</i>

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.555
<i>by reports of a strange masked man.</i>

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:40.152
<i>But he wouldn't let rumors</i>
<i>mess up his scheme.</i>

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.527
<i>So he set out on his final campaign.</i>

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:45.431
<i>He and his boys</i>
<i>rode to the rendezvous</i>

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.527
<i>with President Grant's private train.</i>

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.433
Miss Striker!
Miss Striker!

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.067
Yes, Manuel?

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:57.510
There's a padre wants to see you
in the church right away.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.514
Father Monteleone?

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:00.708
No! Another padre.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:01.909
He said it was very important,

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.747
and I promised that I would bring you.

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.844
Well...

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.980
in that case, I'd best
go see what he wants.

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:11.891
You must have done
something real bad, Miss Striker.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:26.964
More coffee, sir?

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.637
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.009
You're welcome.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.809
Oh! General. Come in, come in!

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.248
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.114
our new guest,
General Aurelio Rodriguez.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.346
He's joining us for the hunt.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.321
- Mr. President.
- General.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:43.415
I'd like to introduce
the legendary Wild Bill Hickok!

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:44.857
Oh, Señor Hickok.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.724
How do you do, sir?

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.696
Right there is the famous
Buffalo Bill Cody.

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.026
Howdy, General.

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:52.033
Señor Buffalo.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.227
And you know, of course,

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.896
Brigadier George Armstrong Custer.

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.165
Brigadier.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.467
General.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.906
Sit down, General.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.237
Armstrong, move over there.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.939
Let the general sit,
or I'll send you up to Montana.

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.412
You sent for me, Father?

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:16.424
Yes, my child.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:22.225
Your writings, they are very brave
but dangerous.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.357
What do you mean, Father?

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:29.268
In my travels, I have met
a man who wears a mask

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:33.399
but is dedicated to law and order.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:37.173
He wants you to know
that he will not stop

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:41.683
until he has brought Cavendish
and his men to justice.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.582
Well, until he finds Cavendish,

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:47.087
I shall simply continue
with my writings.

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:48.316
No, you must not.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.823
You will be hurt.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:54.350
In here, quickly. Please.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:05.001
You see, Father,
I cannot stop my writing.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:06.131
It is my only weapon.

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:09.234
It is all I have.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.973
I understand.

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:13.604
Thank you, Father.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:16.617
I am most grateful for your concern.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:20.176
Now, with respect,
you must excuse me.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:23.783
I'm on my way to a meeting
for President Grant's arrival.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.258
The President?

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:29.127
Yes. He's arriving here
on the afternoon train.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.460
Today?

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.727
Yes.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.665
Although I suspect
the children are more eager

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:35.670
to see Buffalo Bill than
they are to see the President.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.831
My God!

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.703
What is the matter, Father?

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.710
You should have gone
to San Francisco.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.712
What did you say?

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.145
I must go.

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:48.706
Wait!

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:51.685
The masked man?

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.278
Trust him.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.919
Father!

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.426
Father.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.595
Father.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.053
The Del Rio is the
next stop, Mr. President.

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.591
I want to be there and gone
in three minutes, not a breath more.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.183
Yes, Mr. President.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.751
Where the hell is Del Rio?

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:37.856
Gentlemen,
look what I have to put up with.

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.298
Well, I'll leave you on your own.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.302
I have to rewrite that speech

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:44.168
for whatever the name
of that town is.

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.270
Whoa.

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.787
Right turnabout.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.191
Which way?

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.292
Through the gorge. We'll save hours.

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:14.802
Let's go, Silver.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:16.235
Come on, Scout.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.713
The next time we play
poker in Mexico, yes?

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:36.121
No, I don't think so.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.827
Ah, gentlemen. Come in, come in.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:15.523
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.997
Now listen to this, see how you like it.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.672
"And I, as your president,

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.876
"am ready to defend the lives

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:38.442
of American citizens at any cost."

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.748
How do you like it?

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:41.585
Sounds damn good, sir.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:55.429
Look, when I was out here
three years ago,

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.529
these hills were black with buffalo.

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:01.303
I've been here three days,
I haven't seen a single one.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.242
Cody, what happened to them?

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.472
I shot 'em.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.848
Now, here, here, gentlemen.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.783
The plight of the buffalo
and the American Indian,

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:13.617
in these times,

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:15.088
is no laughing matter.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.320
Now, with that, you'll excuse me.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.385
I think I'll take a short nap.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:23.056
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:24.929
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.057
Major.

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.882
Whoa.

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:01.955
The train.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.066
Let's go, Silver.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.444
Switch it.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.932
I am Major Bartholomew Cavendish,

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:24.370
and you, Mr. President,
are my prisoner.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.741
<i>So Cavendish had pulled it off</i>

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:32.302
<i>and vanished without firing a shot.</i>

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.145
<i>The masked man and Tonto</i>
<i>had to move fast</i>

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:38.118
<i>and ride while his trail was still hot.</i>

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.086
<i>They didn't know what he intended to do,</i>

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:42.988
<i>but the life at stake</i>
<i>was President Grant's.</i>

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:45.049
<i>Perhaps Butch would hold him.</i>

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.322
<i>Perhaps Butch would kill him.</i>

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:50.024
<i>They just couldn't take that chance.</i>

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:15.380
Tell me one thing.

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:19.757
Are you here to rescue Grant
or to get Cavendish?

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.888
I signed your court-martial?

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.262
I don't remember.

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.425
What happened wasn't my fault.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.162
Never is.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:32.300
I got that at Shiloh.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.239
Cavalry Major's.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:38.040
It was his last glorious charge.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:40.081
Poor bastard.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.350
Look around you, sir.

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:03.295
Do you see chaos, discontent?

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.390
Or do you see respect and order?

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.367
I hadn't really noticed.

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:09.335
You and the United States

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.372
will notice my country,

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:14.840
the Republic of New Texas.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.344
The manifest destiny of the United States

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.347
will be impaired only slightly.

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:22.440
Major Cavendish,

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.883
you are a diseased son of a bitch.

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.090
I'd like your opinion.

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.894
Yes.

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.992
No, thank you.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.936
"To Mr. Hamilton Fish,
Secretary of State.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.132
"Dear sir,

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:55.005
"Whereas the government
of the United States

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.805
"has failed to provide proper protection

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:59.540
"for American citizens,

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:02.708
"and whereas it has failed
to provide honest leadership

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:03.773
and moral courage..."

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:07.678
"Therefore,

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.452
"let it be known that I,
Major Bartholomew Cavendish,

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.550
"firmly resolve to hold the President

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:14.424
"of the United States as my prisoner

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.794

"Furthermore, I demand that
these lands be granted to me

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:27.066
"by an irrevocable act
of the Congress of the United States

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:30.908
"no later than 30 days

or the life of Ulysses S. Grant

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:39.820
Sign as witness, please.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:41.321
Very good.

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:43.323
You think so?

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.552
Yes, marvelous.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.528
But 30 days is too long to give 'em.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.860
I'd change that.

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:54.231
They'll dicker and debate
and scratch their indecisive asses,

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:57.066
and by the time they sober up,
I'll be dead.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.834
You may be right.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:05.812
Well...

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.179
it'll be interesting to see.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:26.383
Wake up, Sheriff.

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:27.860
Where's the President?

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:31.262
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.963
He's in the next room.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:44.975
I don't know how in
the hell you got in here,

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.070
but you...

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:14.000
Mr. President.

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.770
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:17.812
Eh, Christ! Now what?

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.005
We're here to help.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.446
You don't look like
someone who could help me,

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:24.041
and neither does he.

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.314
Here's a gun.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:30.118
Trust us, sir.

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.022
We're going to get you out of here.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.681
Follow me, sir.

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:09.828
This way.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.960
Light the fuses.

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:13.719
Damn me! The horses!

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:16.229
The horses are loose!

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:17.696
The horses!

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:20.063
Soak up lead, you sons of bitches!

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:22.932
The horses! The horses!

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:38.976
- Jesus, what was that?
- What's going on?

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.486
Let me get my pants on. We'll see.

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.022
Come on! Let's go see!

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.965
- How'd they get in here?
- Where's my horse?

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:50.123
Hey, where the hell
you going and leaving me?

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.125
You're safer here, Mr. President.

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.627
Yeah, but I can help ya!
I've been in a few battles myself, son!

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:57.187
Now you're President,
so keep your head down.

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:26.922
Charge!

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:45.737
Come on, boys! Go get them!

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:47.110
Come on!

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:57.316
Get 'em all! Every one!

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:07.297
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.350
Come on, boys!

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:14.187
Do it!

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:42.007
Your sins will be paid for
in the fires of hell.

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.977
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:55.492
May I know, sir,
to whom am I so indebted?

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:59.260
Mr. President, please allow me
to remain anonymous.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.267
I hope you'll understand.

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:06.204
Well, I respect your dedication,
and I will honor your request.

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:11.142
Tonto, I thank you and I salute you.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.545
Thank me by honoring your treaties
with my people.

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:18.244
Yes. We will try. You have my word.

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.013
Mr. President.

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:22.715
May God ride with you.

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:41.230
Who is that masked man?

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.742
Hi-yo, Silver!

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:45.506

Hi-yo, Silver!
