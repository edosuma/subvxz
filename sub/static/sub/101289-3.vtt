[uplifting music]

00:12.012 --> 00:12.846
Hi.

00:13.013 --> 00:13.888
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.224
-Morning!
-Hey, Sweetie.

00:17.642 --> 00:18.768
[woman] See you Sunday!

00:28.319 --> 00:29.237
[screams]

00:29.320 --> 00:31.197
Oh, my God!

00:32.115 --> 00:33.950
-[police siren blares]
-[cell phones click]

00:35.952 --> 00:37.662
You never get used to the smell, do you?

00:38.329 --> 00:40.915
[voice wavering]
I was opening up my shop for the day,

00:40.999 --> 00:45.670
and I saw him there with his head cut...

00:46.755 --> 00:48.339
clean off of his body.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.481
[theme music]

01:05.023 --> 01:07.317
[vocalizing]

01:25.335 --> 01:27.170
[Blair]
Sterling, you've been fixing your hair

01:27.253 --> 01:28.671
for the past eight minutes now.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.381
If your hairline
gets any more symmetrical,

01:30.465 --> 01:31.966
people are gonna think you got plugs.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.511
Can you walk me into school today?

01:35.136 --> 01:38.014
I would, but I'm really trying
to own my identity as a single American.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.641
Jennings and I were so codependent.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
Codependent like the two of us?
Is that bad?

01:42.268 --> 01:43.937
Oh, God no, your breath is my life.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.856
I'm surprised my love for you
didn't absorb you in the womb.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.359
[sighs] Me neither.
I would absorb you right now if I could.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.069
-Totally.
-[sighs]

01:51.152 --> 01:52.862
But, for real,
I gotta get to lacrosse conditioning.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.573
I have never felt this much dread
going to school before.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.244
This must be how dumb kids feel
or, like... substitutes.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.787
You're making too much out of this.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.206
You know how the 24-hour news cycle works.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.958
I'm sure by now, your "sex thing"

02:05.041 --> 02:07.794
is back page to Coach Boone
finally getting her eye un-crossed.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.254
She looks so much better.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.589
I don't know, I kind of liked how
her left eye was all, like,

02:12.298 --> 02:14.300
"Fuck you, I'm going this way."

02:16.553 --> 02:17.554
No, I can't do it.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.764
-Okay, let's go.
-[sighs]

02:19.848 --> 02:20.932
No more mirror time.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.017
[people chattering]

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
[people whispering]

02:35.446 --> 02:37.448
[school bell rings]

02:39.159 --> 02:41.119
Just know I'm praying for you. [chuckles]

02:48.168 --> 02:52.005
[gasps] Sterling! What a surprise
to see you at Fellowship.

02:52.088 --> 02:55.049
I'm not sure that today
is a good day for you to join us.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.386
Emotions are still pretty raw right now.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.430
Welcome, come on in. Hi.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.016
Help yourself to a chicken biscuit.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.642
Made fresh.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.311
What are you talking about?

03:06.394 --> 03:10.899
Some students are having trouble
processing your erotic transgressions.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.110
The betrayal,
the  graphic  depiction of events.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.028
I never depicted--

03:15.111 --> 03:18.489
Oh, I had Ezequiel show them
what you and Luke did, using dolls.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.159
He was pretty spot on with your voices.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.994
It was quite upsetting.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.246
We're actually having
a grief counselor come in.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.789
Well, when should I come back?

03:26.873 --> 03:28.374
I'll have to get back to you.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.920
I know it's hard, but try to remember:

03:32.670 --> 03:34.547
Isaiah 43:2

03:35.048 --> 03:37.300
"When you pass through the waters,

03:37.592 --> 03:39.219
God is with you."

03:41.721 --> 03:42.805
I know Isaiah!

03:43.306 --> 03:44.599
Stay strong, Sterling.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.142
You'll get through this.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.143
[sighs]

04:03.660 --> 04:06.162
Hey, those chili dogs
were really good earlier, right?

04:06.454 --> 04:08.248
Were they? I don't even know anymore.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.833
Come on, pull yourself together.
Things aren't that bad.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
Oh, thank the Lord. Where have you been?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.462
Do you know how humiliating it is

04:14.545 --> 04:16.506
sitting here alone,
like a couple of lepers?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.967
Why aren't you sitting
with your buddies from the golf team?

04:24.138 --> 04:26.015
How can we trust anything you say anymore?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.351
"Sterling and I
are waiting until marriage.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.187
Our temptations will never
be as strong as our faith."

04:31.271 --> 04:33.648
Apparently, that was
all just locker room talk!

04:33.940 --> 04:35.733
-You fornicator!
-Watch your mouth!

04:35.817 --> 04:37.235
I trusted you! We all did!

04:37.318 --> 04:39.946
Cheese and crackers! Franklin,
you need to sit down, right now.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.990
Fight me in the shower, bitch. Come on!

04:42.198 --> 04:43.866
-Franklin-- Franklin!
-Get out of my way!

04:46.995 --> 04:47.870
What's wrong with him?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.415
They took away my captainship.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.458
They took my Crusaders Captain Club cozy

04:52.542 --> 04:54.168
and they threw it on the floor!

04:54.544 --> 04:55.628
My grandfather--

04:55.837 --> 04:58.756
My grandfather was captain
of the golf team here at Willingham,

04:58.840 --> 05:00.383
and my dad, and my brother.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.552
I was supposed to follow
in their footsteps

05:02.635 --> 05:04.470
and play golf at UGA. Go, Dogs!

05:04.554 --> 05:05.596
[both] Go, Dogs!

05:06.389 --> 05:07.849
Now that dream is dead.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.475
And without a team,

05:10.143 --> 05:12.312
without men to lead to victory,

05:12.729 --> 05:13.604
I have nothing.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.315
What about me? I'm a social pariah.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.608
I'll spend the rest of my high school days
without any friends.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.860
Hey, guys, come on!

05:19.152 --> 05:19.986
Buck up!

05:20.528 --> 05:22.697
Luke, there are a ton of other sports
here at Willingham.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.615
Pick another one and make new buds.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.452
And Sterling, if those dorks at Fellowship
are gonna judge you,

05:27.535 --> 05:29.704
then screw them!
Who cares what they think?

05:29.787 --> 05:32.415
Blair, not caring about what people think
is  your  thing, okay?

05:32.498 --> 05:33.374
I care a lot!

05:34.208 --> 05:36.502
Okay, well, Fellowship is just one clique.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.796
There are plenty of other groups
that you could slide into.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.423
Okay, maybe you're right.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.383
New friends, let's see.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.677
Um...

05:45.887 --> 05:47.305
Well, there's the band kids.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.434
But I play harp, and that's gonna be
really hard to carry in formation.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.895
Um...

05:53.978 --> 05:55.646
Ooh, what about the bad kids?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.776
They're kinda cool, in, like,
a sketchy, alt kind of way.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.569
The bad kids?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.154
Are you sure you can handle that?

06:03.237 --> 06:06.407
I mean, I toyed with the idea
of hanging with them for a minute, but--

06:07.867 --> 06:08.993
[whispering] They smoke.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.371
Yeah, smoking is gross,
but what choice do I have?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.206
Um...

06:13.289 --> 06:16.250
Do you have black eyeliner
and one of those little nose rings

06:16.334 --> 06:17.627
that cartoon bulls have?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.255
We'll do some light styling.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.056
[girl] Yeah!

06:32.600 --> 06:33.893
[groaning]

06:35.686 --> 06:36.979
[voice wavering] It's too small.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.525
[clears throat]

06:47.573 --> 06:48.574
[taps foot]

06:49.784 --> 06:51.077
[clears throat loudly]

06:51.160 --> 06:53.121
Dude, you should get that throat thing
checked out.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.455
It could be enlarged adenoids.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.998
Yeah, it's actually super dangerous.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.834
It's like a chandelier
hanging in the back of your throat.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.252
If you choke on it, you could die.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.295
Yeah. Well, I was clearing my throat

07:01.587 --> 07:04.465
to get your attention off of whatever
idiotic Jonas Brothers bullshit

07:04.549 --> 07:05.716
you were staring at on your phone.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.634
Jonas Brothers?

07:06.717 --> 07:08.344
Yeah. Because I'd like to review our skip.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.139
It's a bit of a dated reference though,
Bowsie.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.142
-Although, they got together recently.
-[Sterling] They put out a new album.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.059
-I did not like it.
-All right.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.521
Clea Kincaid, twenty-four years old,

07:18.604 --> 07:20.314
recent graduate of SCAD.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.649
About six months ago,

07:21.732 --> 07:25.027
she was arrested for cutting the head
off a Confederate statue.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.571
Her first victim...

07:28.364 --> 07:32.577
was General Buford Leslie Woodlawn
in Macon.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.870
She was arrested.

07:33.953 --> 07:34.996
She posted bail.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.664
She skipped her court date

07:36.747 --> 07:38.291
and has been on the lam ever since.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.418
-Lamb?
-[in deep voice] Lamb of God!

07:40.501 --> 07:41.502
[gasps]

07:42.128 --> 07:43.880
I have taught   her something!

07:43.963 --> 07:45.590
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's so loud in your room.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.300
[Bowser] Yeah, on the Lamb of God.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.260
I got video from the night
she was arrested.

07:51.762 --> 07:52.930
[man]  Have a comment, Clea?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.307
Yeah, I've got a comment.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.353
[humming]

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
You get that?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.774
Dang! This lady's a badass.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.026
She's a very good dancer.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.695
Okay, and she's continued
beheading statues

08:07.778 --> 08:08.988
while she's on the loose.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.448
For the last three weeks,

08:10.531 --> 08:12.992
she's hit a different statue
every single night.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.621
So, it's our job to figure out
which one she's gonna hit next,

08:17.079 --> 08:18.498
and arrest her in the act.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.457
Shouldn't be too hard.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.168
I mean, how many Confederate statues 
can there be in Atlanta?

08:22.251 --> 08:23.377
One hundred and seventy four.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.464
-Dang!
-Dang! They know the South lost, right?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.591
It is so weird
what people get nostalgic for.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.511
"Weird," "racist."
Whatever you want to call it.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.556
Exactly. Bowser, how can you
want to arrest this woman?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.934
Don't you support what she's doing?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.687
You know... for black people.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.730
She's a skip.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.190
I don't see black or white.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.858
All right? My motto is,

08:46.192 --> 08:48.736
"You take the assignment,
you bring in the fugitive."

08:48.819 --> 08:50.821
Your motto is, "The road to Heaven
is paved with sprinkles."

08:51.030 --> 08:53.366
That's my yogurt motto!
I'm talking about my bounty motto.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.326
Sterl, you can't be on board
with this, right?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.371
You know, I'm having
a really rough time lately

08:58.454 --> 09:01.040
and bounty hunting is the one thing
that actually makes sense to me.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.875
So can we  please  just do our job?

09:03.584 --> 09:04.627
[groans] Fine.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.379
But I'm not gonna cuff her.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.173
And  I'm bringing a snack
for her ride to jail.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.301
Something... Sour Patch.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.596
Last night's statue was here.

09:17.139 --> 09:20.434
General Tobias Xavier Mulch.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.603
Hey, I know that statue.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.063
It's right near Franklin High.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.524
That's where Sterling
debated Tammy Rutledge so hard

09:26.607 --> 09:28.276
she got her period. [blows raspberry]

09:28.359 --> 09:30.319
Well, technically, I lost due to points,

09:30.403 --> 09:33.406
but I count Tammy getting
a stress-induced menstruation as a win.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.408
-So...
-I got it.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.326
What you got?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.120
I see a pattern.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.250
It's a penis.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.336
Oh, God, I think we're gonna need
outside help for this.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.963
You know, our dad gets mailers

09:49.046 --> 09:51.716
from the Confederate Historical Society
here in town.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.510
They sponsor
his Civil War Reenactment League.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.220
See, that's why I keep you guys around.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.138
Wait, she's right.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.098
Look, the little traffic thingies
are testicles.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.602
-[Blair] But there are three thingies.
-[Sterling] Yeah, some people have three.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.104
Remember... what was his name?

10:05.187 --> 10:07.064
-Dwight, no--
-Declan Wright.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.691
Declan Wright,
and he went horseback riding

10:08.774 --> 10:09.984
and one of his balls split in half?

10:10.067 --> 10:12.695
My gosh, he was
in my second semester study hall.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.904
Why was a senior in your study hall?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.948
Because I dropped Chorus second semester,

10:16.032 --> 10:17.867
so it ended up putting me at a weird time

10:17.950 --> 10:19.493
-in study hall time.
-I remember that.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.329
And then I ended up
getting to sit with the seniors,

10:21.412 --> 10:23.497
which was really cool, because that's how
I met that blue-eyed guy...

10:25.625 --> 10:27.251
[tires screech]

10:27.335 --> 10:29.378
[rock music plays]

10:29.462 --> 10:30.588
[music stops]

10:31.172 --> 10:32.798
So, tell me what you like better.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.301
Should I get one of those tattoos
that goes across your stomach

10:35.384 --> 10:36.886
and says something like, "Freedom,"

10:36.969 --> 10:40.723
or should I cut my hair
and do, like, a mohawk with bangs?

10:40.806 --> 10:43.309
-I don't know. What do you think?
-What has gotten into you?

10:43.392 --> 10:45.353
I've been reborn a single lady

10:45.436 --> 10:46.520
and I want to show it.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.939
Now that I've unbuckled myself
from "Jennings, the human speed bump,"

10:49.023 --> 10:50.399
I feel free.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.610
Free to meet somebody interesting.

10:52.985 --> 10:53.986
And dangerous.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.406
Someone who will, like,
get jealous and stalk me.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.034
And maybe break in our house
in the middle of the night

11:00.117 --> 11:00.951
and watch me sleep.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.995
And I realize, as I'm saying this,
this is a bad idea.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.208
I'm just saying I want to meet somebody
interesting and cool.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.377
-Bazinga! [laughs]
-[Blair] Not a total dork.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.587
Oh, Blair. Blair, hey.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.381
-Me?
-Yeah.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.466
-Oh, hey.
-Hey. Um...

11:15.966 --> 11:19.095
So, you know, I just wanted to follow up
on our text message exchange.

11:19.970 --> 11:20.805
You know?

11:21.889 --> 11:22.723
Our-- Our date.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.184
I'm sorry, I've been so busy.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.727
There was a Blood Moon.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.563
Plus, you know, the economy.
[blows raspberry]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.774
-So... Oh.
-Well, no, that's okay.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.777
Um... Because I'm free whenever
you're ready to get together.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.903
We're together right now.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.282
So, in a way, legally,
we're already on that date.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.076
-[both chuckle]
-I am such a third wheel.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.994
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be alone,
and then I'll--

11:44.078 --> 11:45.746
Okay, but no, you know, like a date.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.208
It's when you go out with food,
and music and stuff.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.379
Um... Sure. Yeah.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.715
Food and music.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.217
-Yeah?
-I'll-- I'll text you.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.135
Okay.

12:00.052 --> 12:00.886
See you.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.430
I'll see ya.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.765
God, he's awkward.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.642
[Sterling] Come on, he's sweet.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.060
[Blair] Sweet is not my type.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.229
[classical music playing]

12:13.524 --> 12:15.901
Girls, where have you been?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.946
You know how particular
your grandparents are about punctuality.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.198
Okay. Now you are
to be on your best behavior.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.491
-Do you understand?
-Why?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.160
Well, um... [clears throat]

12:25.202 --> 12:27.580
Your father is asking Big Daddy
for a promotion

12:27.663 --> 12:28.622
and it's very important.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.374
So Sterling,
do not play with your cuticles.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.917
You know your grandmother hates that.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.627
Blair... [snaps fingers] ...no politics.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.172
During this lunch, 
climate change is not real.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.590
-[Blair] Um--
-Shh.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.091
Smile. Smile.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.259
[breathes deeply]

12:40.342 --> 12:41.260
Shoulders back.

12:46.974 --> 12:47.975
Your bisque, sir.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.185
Oh, dear.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.686
Mmm.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.439
Big Daddy, Mother, did y'all hear?

12:53.522 --> 12:56.650
Sterling was chosen Fellowship Leader
this year.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.944
-Oh, that's wonderful, sweetie!
-Congratulations, darling!

12:59.028 --> 13:00.696
-What an honor!
-That's just terrific!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.656
[chuckling]
Thank you. It's no big deal, really.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.366
I don't even really like talking
about it that much--

13:04.450 --> 13:06.285
No. She's so modest.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.162
Oh, Debbie, I've been meaning to ask you.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.705
How are your parents doing?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.584
Uh... Well, they're dead, Mother.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.837
[nervous chuckle] Remember they died
in that private plane crash

13:16.921 --> 13:18.088
when I was a teenager?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.757
Oh, how silly of me.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.760
I just can't get my head
around them doing that.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.138
You see, we Wesleys, we live. [chuckles]

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
That's our thing.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.519
[clears throat] Well, tell me, how do you
two like living out at the lake house?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.437
Oh, we quite enjoy being out of the city,

13:33.521 --> 13:37.399
what with all of its noise
and bustle and diversity.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.693
I'm happiest in my hunting blind

13:39.902 --> 13:42.905
with a box of hollow-points
and a flask of Buffalo Trace.

13:42.988 --> 13:43.823
[chuckling]

13:43.906 --> 13:46.992
You know, since you've been out of
the office so much, Big Daddy,

13:47.076 --> 13:49.036
I've been stepping up,
bringing in some big clients--

13:49.119 --> 13:50.663
Yeah, I got a new gun, too.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.040
But I read an article in  Bullet and Bow

13:53.123 --> 13:55.084
about how you can sneak up on the deer

13:55.167 --> 13:57.628
and kill them execution style.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.839
Probably takes some getting used to,

13:59.922 --> 14:01.090
like switching putters.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.634
[light laughter]

14:03.717 --> 14:07.346
To be honest... I-- I've been bringing in
even more business than Deacon has.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.349
Mm-hm. Yeah, I think he's even getting
jealous of his little brother.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.477
[laughter]

14:13.561 --> 14:16.230
With all the work that Anderson has been
doing for the company,

14:16.313 --> 14:18.190
pretty soon you're gonna have 
to change the name

14:18.274 --> 14:20.484
from, "Wesley and Son"
to "Wesley and Sons."

14:21.068 --> 14:23.070
Plural. Like making Anderson a partner.

14:23.153 --> 14:26.323
I don't know how anybody 
can talk about work these days

14:26.407 --> 14:30.661
with that lunatic running
around decapitating statues.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.207
[groans]
Desecrating our proud Southern legacy.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.295
-Don't do it.
-I have to! For America!

14:39.378 --> 14:40.838
Blair, no. You heard Mom. Stop it!

14:40.921 --> 14:42.172
I can't. I can't help it.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.883
It's like a sneeze. Here it comes!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.467
I think what that woman is doing

14:45.551 --> 14:47.094
is a brave political statement.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.679
And I, for one, applaud her.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.808
[mother clears throat]

14:53.601 --> 14:55.269
[Big Daddy] If y'all will excuse me,

14:55.352 --> 14:58.898
I believe I will enjoy my bisque
on the veranda.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.458
Dang!

15:18.334 --> 15:19.293
Look at this place.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.255
Looks like a jerk-off booth
for the  Dukes of Hazzard.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.175
Well, hello there.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.927
Oh, what a wonderful sight,

15:28.010 --> 15:29.845
to see two young people still dress up

15:29.929 --> 15:32.222
to come celebrate
their rich heritage as...

15:32.932 --> 15:36.226
Oh-- Okay, look, if y'all are protestors,

15:36.310 --> 15:39.229
you need to stay at least
five hundred feet from the front door.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.440
We're not protestors. I'm a bounty hunter.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.318
I'm trying to track down the woman
who's decapitating those statues

15:44.401 --> 15:45.945
-so I can arrest her.
-Oh.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.029
Well, I'm surprised,

15:47.112 --> 15:49.865
-but I'm delighted to hear that.
-All right.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.909
I must say this whole
Ben Carson experiment

15:51.992 --> 15:53.535
is working out after all.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.622
Um, we'd like to speak to one
of the Sisters of the Confederacy, please.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.665
Well, you got one right here.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.208
Sister Jim, at your service.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.126
Aren't sisters usually women?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.253
Ah, that's an antiquated way of thinking.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.548
It's 2020! Men can be women,
women can be governors,

16:06.632 --> 16:09.510
but not in Georgia, yet, thank God.
[chuckles]

16:09.593 --> 16:11.553
Anyhow, how can I help y'all?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.890
I'm telling you,
I've looked at this thing a hundred ways

16:14.974 --> 16:17.017
and I can't figure out any rhyme or reason

16:17.101 --> 16:18.852
to which statues this woman is hitting.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.896
It's not chronological,
it's not alphabetical--

16:20.980 --> 16:22.106
Could it be phallic-al?

16:22.189 --> 16:23.941
Okay, enough with the "phallic-al".

16:24.024 --> 16:25.859
What's this... emblem right here?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.237
Oh. Oh, that's a commemorative emblem

16:28.320 --> 16:30.406
for those who fought
in the Battle of Peachtree Creek.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.907
Huge victory for us!

16:31.991 --> 16:34.785
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that emblem
before somewhere.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.495
Where-- There! Right here.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.622
This guy. He fought in the same battle?

16:38.747 --> 16:42.001
Gosh, maybe all these soldiers
fought at Peachtree Creek.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.759
He's right, they did.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.927
[taps photo]

16:52.011 --> 16:53.679
Oh, my God, did we just solve a mystery?

16:54.805 --> 16:56.390
Oh, my God! We're like Nancy Drew!

16:56.473 --> 16:59.184
-[chuckling]
-Hey! Hey! Hey, come on!

16:59.977 --> 17:02.104
What's happ--?
Easy, Sister. Come on, Sister.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.607
Wait-- Wait, there's one that isn't listed
in the Battle of Peachtree Creek.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.069
-General Horace Grover Winfield.
-[Sister Jim] Well, that's right.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.738
Winfield's regiment would
have been occupied

17:10.821 --> 17:12.906
in the Siege of Petersburg in July of '64.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.491
[Bowser] It's gotta be a mistake.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.161
Maybe the list is wrong
or maybe Clea messed up

17:17.244 --> 17:20.581
and she thought Winfield
fought at this battle, and he didn't.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.791
It's too close not to be it.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.209
It's gotta be Peachtree Creek.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.295
We need to figure out
who else fought in that battle

17:26.378 --> 17:28.964
-that has a statue somewhere near the--
-Rutherford Quincy Thigpen,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.259
born 1830, died 1863 when he--

17:32.342 --> 17:35.429
His statue was erected in 1919 
in Bellwood Park.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.472
Ew.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.473
Erected.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.474
Ew.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.725
Ew.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.893
-[both giggle]
-It's so gross.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.269
-It says it right there.
-I know.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.771
All right, so that's it,

17:43.854 --> 17:44.813
-Bellwood Park.
-Bellwood Park!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.106
-That's it.
-Okay.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.748
'Sup?

18:04.625 --> 18:05.626
Mind if I hang?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.545
Shouldn't you be hanging out
with your God gang?

18:08.629 --> 18:10.172
Oh, I got kicked out. [chuckles]

18:11.507 --> 18:12.341
What for?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.259
Intercourse, ever heard of it?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.097
Uh, I'm in the market for a new crew.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.515
What are you guys into?

18:19.932 --> 18:20.808
Satanic temple.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.563
[exhales deeply]
So, like... devil worshipping and stuff?

18:26.647 --> 18:27.481
Even better.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.900
We promote egalitarianism, social justice

18:29.983 --> 18:31.527
and the separation of church and state.

18:32.736 --> 18:33.570
Uh...

18:33.654 --> 18:36.240
Through like, potions and hellfire

18:36.323 --> 18:37.241
and, um...

18:37.866 --> 18:40.828
[in deep voice] Lamb of God.
[chuckles] My sister loves them.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.080
No, through altruism.

18:43.330 --> 18:46.166
Performance art, member gatherings
and community outreach.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.418
This is an after-school program

18:48.502 --> 18:50.462
we run every day
for the middle school kids.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.673
We're actually looking
for some volunteers,

18:54.216 --> 18:55.092
if you want to sign up.

18:56.844 --> 18:57.845
Oh, wow, that's a lot.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.681
You know, I might have
some potential conflicts,

19:00.764 --> 19:02.349
but I will let you know.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.726
Well, we have weekend events, too.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.436
We're doing a car wash
for Lupus this Sunday.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.438
There's an extra goat torso
if you're interested.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.898
It comes with little horns.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.026
[thud]

19:13.652 --> 19:16.029
[sighs]
The life of a bad kid is so demanding.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.448
-Separating churches from their states...
-[music playing]

19:18.532 --> 19:20.868
-washing cars and--
-Sounds like you dodged a bullet.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.452
I am so upset.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.413
I just wish this whole thing
had never happened.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.123
That you never had sex with Luke?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.625
No, no. Luke and I are in love,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.586
and I'm right with my God.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.754
I just... [breathes deeply]

19:32.838 --> 19:35.257
I wish that I'd never admitted it
in Fellowship,

19:35.674 --> 19:37.050
because those judgmental jerks

19:37.134 --> 19:39.178
view making love
with your long-term boyfriend

19:39.261 --> 19:41.388
on the same level as, like, mass murder.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.057
I'm basically the Hillside Strangler.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.517
You're a good person.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.228
You cried last week
when you stepped on that roly poly.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.730
Well, he was just living his life.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.647
Yeah.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.524
I'll find my people.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.401
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.652
And what about you?

19:56.528 --> 19:57.446
What about me?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.490
Um, why are you bringing Miles
to Bargain Hole?

20:00.574 --> 20:03.869
I want this to feel
as little like a date as possible

20:03.952 --> 20:06.705
while still meeting
the technical parameters of a date.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.041
There's food and there's music.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.877
Also, I really want to price
one of those leather recliners.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.921
I saw a picture of a cat curled up on one

20:14.004 --> 20:15.380
and she looked so comfortable.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.590
Cool. Okay.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.634
Are you sure that you don't want to,
like, go home

20:18.717 --> 20:20.761
and change and shower though?

20:20.844 --> 20:23.680
-You smell like the inside of a leg cast.
-Ooh.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
-Nah, I'm good.
-Okay.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.351
Okay.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.811
-Oh, God.
-You can do it.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.189
[groans]

20:32.814 --> 20:33.690
Love you!

21:02.094 --> 21:04.805
[funky soulful music]

21:27.577 --> 21:28.412
Hey.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.081
Hot-- Hey.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.084
Hey, to you. And to yours.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.378
I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.338
I thought tonight
was supposed to be our date.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.425
It-- It is. [stammers]

21:41.967 --> 21:43.468
That's why I wanted to bring you

21:43.552 --> 21:45.721
somewhere really special to me,

21:45.804 --> 21:49.141
where I've had
some of my happiest memories.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.105
And I wore an outfit

21:55.355 --> 21:57.983
that says a lot about me as a woman.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.653
-And a goalie.
-Yeah.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.156
You look great. I love your outfit!

22:04.239 --> 22:05.657
This? I just threw this on.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.326
Came straight from the metal shop.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.828
I'm in the middle of welding
this copper monocle

22:09.911 --> 22:12.456
for a Steampunk rave I'm DJing
in Castleberry Hill.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.249
So...

22:16.043 --> 22:17.127
Let's go get some food,

22:17.210 --> 22:20.797
and then we can... uh, check out the...

22:20.881 --> 22:22.591
uh-- Oh, the knife sharpening station,

22:22.674 --> 22:25.510
because I-- I, like, love danger.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.722
-Cool. Yeah.
-Cool, yeah.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.360
Mm.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.656
-Mm.
-[coughs]

22:46.740 --> 22:48.241
[chuckles and clears throat]

22:49.201 --> 22:51.078
-More tea?
-Thank you, sure.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.876
Now, are you sure that
you and Big Daddy won't stay for dinner?

22:58.168 --> 23:02.422
-You know, I'm roasting a chicken.
-Oh, is that what that smell is?

23:02.506 --> 23:05.675
[chuckles] I thought maybe an owl
got stuck in the bug zapper.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.097
Ah.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.390
How was wood chopping?

23:12.474 --> 23:13.558
[mother gasps]

23:13.642 --> 23:16.937
Anderson still doesn't know
how to hold an ax like a man.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.480
So, I told him to stop.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.732
We'll try it again in a few months.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.279
I-- I think we should be gettin' back
to the hotel.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.199
Uh, are you sure
y'all won't stay here with us?

23:29.282 --> 23:30.951
We have so much room.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.161
Oh, honey, we don't want to be a bother.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.332
And besides, you have so much housework
you obviously need to do.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.626
Then we'll see you tomorrow at brunch.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.336
-[blows kiss]
-Bye, now.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.258
[Debbie] See y'all tomorrow!

23:48.844 --> 23:50.887
Well, Anderson, what did he say?

23:52.013 --> 23:53.014
He didn't say much.

23:53.348 --> 23:55.434
Well, he said I hold an ax like a penguin.
[chuckles]

23:55.517 --> 23:57.436
And then he called me
a penguin for a while.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.563
And then he just shortened that to "Guin",

23:59.646 --> 24:01.773
and then he stumbled into
"Gwyneth Paltrow."

24:01.857 --> 24:02.899
[snickers]

24:02.983 --> 24:04.025
He seemed to enjoy that.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.445
No, no, no, what did he say
about making you partner?

24:06.528 --> 24:07.654
Oh. Um...

24:07.737 --> 24:08.822
He never brought it up.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.115
-He  never brought it up?
-Mm-mm.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.242
Wha--  You're  supposed to bring it up.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.703
You know full well
Big Daddy isn't gonna bring it up himself.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.121
Now's not the right time.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.164
They'll be back at Christmas,

24:17.247 --> 24:18.999
and he's always high on the Lord's birth.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.167
I'll ask him then.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.044
Christmas? Honey, why will you not just
take the bull by the horns?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.172
It's like I care about this 
more than you do!

24:25.255 --> 24:27.757
It is like you care about it more
than I do and--

24:28.592 --> 24:29.426
Why is that?

24:29.509 --> 24:31.052
I mean, it's not like we need the money.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.637
Unless there's something I don't know.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.391
I...

24:36.975 --> 24:39.227
I just wish that you...

24:41.480 --> 24:43.231
would stand up for yourself.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.611
Huh?

24:48.945 --> 24:51.740
What happened to the man that I married?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.201
He wasn't afraid of anything.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.163
I miss that man.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.770
[music playing]

25:22.646 --> 25:23.605
Oh, how's your Ensure?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.065
It's... plain.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.233
Yeah, good, right?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.567
My dad drinks wine like this--

25:29.110 --> 25:30.487
[slurping]

25:35.450 --> 25:36.284
Yeah.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.411
[Blair clears throat]

25:40.330 --> 25:42.499
Hi. Two taquitos, please.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.125
Sorry, I just gave out my last one.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.379
Uh... Do you think you could
just heat up some more?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.797
We've been waiting in line.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.759
Okay, that's-- Yeah, that's no worries.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.511
I'm taking the crumb napkin.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.305
-You're gonna take the crumb napkin?
-Yeah, because it just--

25:57.389 --> 25:58.890
Oh, my God, it looks so delicious.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.100
Thank you, so much.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.142
Have a blessed day.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.479
Come on. 
Let's dine on the patio, shall we?

26:11.194 --> 26:12.195
So this is nice.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.449
So, what kind of music do you listen to?

26:16.533 --> 26:19.452
I've been listening to a lot of
Linqua Franqa, Lil Keed.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.289
Yeah, the new Thouxanbanfauni? It's dope.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.500
Thou-zan...

26:26.251 --> 26:27.669
-Thouxanbanfauni.
-[woman] Hi, there.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.046
Interested in the Vera Cruz
seven-piece, I see?

26:30.130 --> 26:32.048
Do you mind? We're on a date right now.

26:32.132 --> 26:32.966
A date?

26:33.550 --> 26:35.260
At... Bargain Hole?

26:41.516 --> 26:42.642
Wow.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.145
Actually... um, I gotta get going.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.271
Going? Where?

26:46.354 --> 26:48.398
It's early. We should catch a flick
in the TV section.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.025
I think Zootopia just started.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.110
I promised my sister
I'd come to this party she's having.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.195
Oh, a party. Perfect! I'll come with you.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.325
Oh. Uh...

26:58.408 --> 27:00.160
Actually, I just had this great idea.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.995
I'll change first and meet you there.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.457
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay, um... text me the addy.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.459
[chewing]

27:07.542 --> 27:09.336
...and the football team
already had tryouts.

27:09.419 --> 27:10.795
And I can't do cross country

27:10.879 --> 27:13.632
because running
makes me carsick, you know?

27:14.257 --> 27:16.635
And soccer's just for French people.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.219
This is hopeless.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.055
[breathes deeply]

27:20.138 --> 27:21.264
Without a team to be a part of,

27:21.348 --> 27:24.142
my life literally,
literally has no purpose.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.561
[Sterling] Hey, we're Team SterLuke.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.980
[cell phone rings]

27:30.649 --> 27:32.901
Hey, I thought I wasn't
supposed to pick you up for another hour.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.236
Get over here now and pick me up!

27:35.320 --> 27:36.988
What's wrong?
Did Miles do something creepy?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.990
No, worse! He's hot!

27:39.074 --> 27:41.451
What? What's the problem, then?
I don't understand.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.745
Just... stop asking questions,
there's no time.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.622
We're going to a college party with him.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.873
So, just get over here, stat!

27:46.956 --> 27:48.041
A college party?

27:48.124 --> 27:49.793
Wait a minute, that's perfect!

27:49.876 --> 27:51.753
That's who I should be hanging out with,
college kids!

27:51.836 --> 27:53.880
Everybody here is either too intense
or too immature.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.131
I need friends who are, like--

27:55.215 --> 27:57.550
Just get the hell over here
and pick me up!

27:57.759 --> 27:58.802
Miles is hot!

27:58.885 --> 28:00.887
I repeat-- Miles is hot!

28:02.430 --> 28:03.306
Okay.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.188
I gotta go, babe. Blair needs me.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.189
You gonna be okay?

28:11.272 --> 28:13.358
Wait, what? You going to a college party?

28:13.858 --> 28:15.944
Someone's hot at a college party?

28:19.072 --> 28:20.073
I'll be fine.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.408
[door opens]

28:22.701 --> 28:23.535
[door closes]

28:26.746 --> 28:28.998
We, uh... have this space reserved.

28:29.082 --> 28:29.916
Oh.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.793
Uh...

28:34.045 --> 28:34.963
You all right, bud?

28:36.089 --> 28:37.549
Uh, actually, no.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.008
Not really.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.719
If you got the blues.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.637
You know what to do with 'em, don't ya?

28:43.304 --> 28:44.639
[strums tone]

28:48.727 --> 28:51.146
[hip hop music playing]

29:00.321 --> 29:01.531
[funky soulful music]

29:10.623 --> 29:12.500
[hip hop music playing]

29:18.923 --> 29:20.592
Wow, college kids!

29:20.967 --> 29:23.219
Philosophical, deep, no boundaries.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.345
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

29:24.429 --> 29:25.430
These are my people!

29:25.513 --> 29:26.556
Shh.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.308
Hey.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.518
Dude, I'm trying to make Miles
think that I'm cool.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.520
Can we just... be chill?

29:47.076 --> 29:49.287
Oh, hey, take my photo.
I want to put it in my story

29:49.370 --> 29:50.580
so that everyone can see me partying

29:50.663 --> 29:52.081
with my cool, new college friends.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.583
Drinking is bad, Sterl.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.628
Yeah, well, so is icing out your peer
for enjoying pleasures of the flesh.

29:56.711 --> 29:57.921
-Take the photo.
-Okay.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.758
[Blair giggles]

30:02.884 --> 30:04.719
I mean, if you're gonna do it,
just go for it.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.054
That looks really fake.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.889
-Like, put it to your lips.
-Okay.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.059
-Ooh.
-Oh.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.020
Oh, no, a little got in my mouth.
What do I do?

30:15.104 --> 30:17.148
-Water?
-Wait, this tastes pretty good.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.776
Why does everybody say that alcohol
tastes like poison?

30:19.859 --> 30:20.985
It does  not  taste like that.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.488
Does poison taste like cherry?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.158
All right, we only have two hours

30:27.242 --> 30:28.535
before we have to go meet Bowser.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.577
I'm gonna go find Miles.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.079
Okay. I'll be chill.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.039
It's time for the Blair Show, baby.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.630
Sterling Wesley, how the heck are ya?

30:41.297 --> 30:42.465
[chuckles] Hey.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.432
Mm-hm.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.394
All right. [exhales deeply]

30:56.104 --> 30:58.064
Prepare to have your ass kicked, fruit.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.275
[video game bleeping]

31:04.153 --> 31:06.322
[rustling]

31:24.257 --> 31:25.884
[liquid drizzling]

31:25.967 --> 31:26.926
Freeze!

31:28.052 --> 31:30.680
Oh. Damn it, you made me pee on my watch.

31:30.763 --> 31:31.681
Sister Jim?

31:32.473 --> 31:34.225
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Same as you, Bowser.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.935
Making sure we catch our bandit.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.437
Figured you need some help.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.274
Come on, we're cooking up some sausages

31:41.357 --> 31:42.692
on the engine of my Chevy.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.070
Did you say "we"?

31:46.696 --> 31:47.989
What do you mean, "we"?

31:48.907 --> 31:52.535
Y'all, this is the bounty hunter
I was telling you about, Bowser.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.747
Bowser, this is Sister Rick, Sister Todd

31:55.830 --> 31:57.498
and that there is Sister Ned.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.751
Sister Ned just got released
on parole this afternoon.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.128
Spent a year in prison on a felony charge.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.671
-Oh, yeah? Which one?
-[music playing]

32:03.755 --> 32:04.714
Indecent exposure.

32:04.797 --> 32:05.632
Whipped my johnson out

32:05.715 --> 32:07.884
at a Kid Rock concert 
over at the Speedway.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.969
[all chuckle]

32:10.261 --> 32:11.429
I was asking which prison,

32:11.512 --> 32:13.181
but... good to know.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.641
Damn excited for tonight.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.267
We gonna get her, ain't we?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.727
[chuckling] No. No. No.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.562
We're not gonna "get her."

32:19.646 --> 32:22.857
Uh... I'm gonna arrest her
and deliver her back to the court.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.484
Yeah. That's right.

32:24.567 --> 32:25.401
We gonna get her.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.736
-We gonna get her good! 
-Yeah.

32:26.819 --> 32:27.820
[Sister Ned laughs]

32:27.904 --> 32:29.781
You know, I almost dated
a black woman once,

32:30.156 --> 32:32.533
but every time I asked her out,
she said no.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.911
Really? I'm shocked.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.705
Yeah. Hey, would you guys
excuse me for a moment?

32:37.789 --> 32:40.541
I'm gonna take a walk
and look at the statue.

32:41.125 --> 32:41.960
All right?

32:42.835 --> 32:43.795
[sighs]

32:43.878 --> 32:46.422
Get away from you backwoods, dick-waving,

32:46.506 --> 32:48.967
engine-block-sausage-eating motherfuckers.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.636
What have we got here?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.347
[exhales deeply]

32:54.847 --> 32:56.432
[men chatter]

33:08.903 --> 33:09.862
[cell phone bleeps]

33:12.782 --> 33:13.741
[cell phone bleeps]

33:21.541 --> 33:24.127
[cell phone bleeps]

33:25.878 --> 33:26.879
[cell phone bleeps]

33:26.963 --> 33:28.297
All right, shoot already.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.384
[man] Whoo!

33:31.467 --> 33:33.177
[hip hop music playing]

33:38.266 --> 33:40.059
[cheering]

34:13.092 --> 34:15.094
[cheering and music continue]

34:52.298 --> 34:53.132
So good!

34:53.883 --> 34:55.259
You should try it. Look.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.099
You know, I heard Michelle Alexander
talk about that.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.892
She called the private prison industry

35:03.226 --> 35:05.645
"this hungry beast with an
insatiable appetite."

35:06.270 --> 35:07.605
[woman] Wow.

35:07.688 --> 35:10.566
Look at Tonya's little brother
going to Michelle Alexander lectures.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.527
Next time, you should
bring me as your date.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.035
This college chick is trying
to lure Miles away from me

35:21.119 --> 35:22.578
with her extra-ass college smart talk.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.538
What should I do?

35:23.704 --> 35:27.625
[drunken gibberish] Well, you know...
ladies do... but I said,

35:27.708 --> 35:30.086
"Sixty bucks and get off my property."

35:31.337 --> 35:32.755
-What?
-[belches]

35:36.050 --> 35:40.680
Um... Yeah. Speaking of
our broken criminal justice system,

35:40.763 --> 35:43.516
I'm thinking about writing a thes... is

35:43.599 --> 35:47.228
about the, um, decapitated statue case?

35:47.562 --> 35:49.438
I really respect Clea Kincaid.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.440
She is so brave.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.568
That's something we can all agree on.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.527
Oh, can we?

35:56.028 --> 35:58.364
Can we...  all  agree?

35:59.866 --> 36:00.741
Um...

36:01.284 --> 36:02.118
Yes?

36:02.201 --> 36:05.204
So, we're all supposed to, uh, have
the same opinion because we're black?

36:05.288 --> 36:06.455
What? No.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.750
Because she's taking a stance
against symbols of hate.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.838
Yeah, uh, first of all,
tearing down those statues hurts us.

36:13.921 --> 36:14.755
Why?

36:14.839 --> 36:16.841
Who do you think's tax dollars
are gonna be diverted to pay for 'em?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.050
They're not gonna fix them.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.927
Because you already know
some right-wing faction's

36:20.011 --> 36:21.220
gonna fight to have them repaired.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.763
Don't think it's not already happening.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.725
Secondly, I believe those statues
have to stay up

36:26.225 --> 36:28.394
as a reminder of the atrocities committed.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.105
It's like the greatest drunk text
of all time.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.566
You just can't take that shit down
from the cloud.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.694
Those statues need to stay there, forever.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.447
[Blair] Oh, my God, so you're saying
you actually side with the people

36:39.530 --> 36:42.783
who want to catch Clea and put her in jail
for her political statement?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.243
No, I don't  side  with them!

36:44.327 --> 36:46.245
-Well--
-See, that's your problem.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.331
-You think everything's black and white...
-[scoffs]

36:48.414 --> 36:50.249
right and wrong, column A, column B.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.710
A guy who's worthy of your time

36:53.044 --> 36:55.129
or a loser who parks cars.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.089
What? That is not true.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.386
Okay, maybe I didn't 
pick the best spot for a date.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.472
-Sorry!
-Don't be too hard on yourself.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.390
Those little taquito crumbs

37:06.474 --> 37:08.517
and the vanilla osteoporosis supplement,

37:08.768 --> 37:09.769
wasn't all that bad.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.646
See, just be real with me...

37:11.896 --> 37:12.855
for a second.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.149
You didn't want to date me.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.318
You could've just said that.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.197
Okay, first of all, it is not my fault
that those taquitos ran out.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.240
It's a numbers game.

37:22.323 --> 37:23.699
You know that. And second of all--

37:23.783 --> 37:25.368
Hey! I got it! I got it!

37:25.451 --> 37:28.287
The next statue Clea's gonna hit is the--

37:28.371 --> 37:30.915
-[vomits]
-[crowd groans]

37:32.250 --> 37:33.668
[man, chuckling] Nice!

37:36.003 --> 37:36.837
Listen to me--

37:36.921 --> 37:39.048
Um, can you please direct
your words towards the sky,

37:39.131 --> 37:41.550
because your puke breath
smells like pizza jello.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.971
It's not Peachtree Creek that ties
the statues together, it's schools.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.097
They're all near schools.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.766
-Come on, we gotta tell Bowser.
-[muffled] Okay, call him.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.059
All right.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.061
What are you talking about schools?

37:52.144 --> 37:53.896
The statue Clea hit last night

37:53.980 --> 37:55.731
was right opposite Franklin High School,

37:55.815 --> 37:57.441
and the one she hit the night before

37:57.525 --> 38:00.736
was right opposite...
um, Maxwell Junior High.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.571
That's where Blair
had that cross country meet

38:02.655 --> 38:03.656
and she found that toe.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.075
Um, no, it wasn't a toe.
It had a hangnail.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.785
-[groans]
-No, think about it, Bowser.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.705
That's why Horace Grover Winfield
doesn't fit in with the others.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.498
He wasn't in
the Battle of Peachtree Creek,

38:12.581 --> 38:14.917
but his statue
was right opposite Clayton Elementary.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.210
[Bowser]  So, which one is she gonna hit?

38:16.294 --> 38:19.588
Corporal Reginald Samantha Culbertson,

38:19.672 --> 38:21.507
right opposite Split Rock Elementary.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.510
It's the last statue within
a mile of a school left in Atlanta.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.387
All right, good.

38:26.929 --> 38:27.930
I'll meet you there, then.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.683
Meet who where?

38:30.766 --> 38:31.642
[gasp]

38:32.226 --> 38:34.979
Hey. I'm just going
to meet a friend, that's all.

38:35.062 --> 38:36.897
You wouldn't be heading off without us,
would ya?

38:36.981 --> 38:39.483
I mean, you don't want to go
find this lady on your own?

38:39.984 --> 38:41.027
She might get away.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.070
You don't want that. Do ya?

38:47.158 --> 38:47.992
No!

38:49.118 --> 38:49.952
He's running!

38:50.369 --> 38:51.537
Saddle up, Sisters!

38:51.620 --> 38:53.205
Get the sausages off the engine!

38:53.289 --> 38:55.207
Move it! Watch your fingers!

38:55.291 --> 38:57.335
You ride shotgun! Let's roll!

38:57.835 --> 38:59.003
[Sister Ned] Aw, hell!

39:02.131 --> 39:03.841
[metallic grinding]

39:07.845 --> 39:08.721
Ah.

39:12.266 --> 39:15.144
[Bowser] Clea Kincaid! Freeze!

39:15.227 --> 39:16.312
[grinding stops]

39:16.395 --> 39:17.813
I'm a Bail Enforcement Agent.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.941
Get down off of there
and put that grinder away.

39:22.234 --> 39:24.070
How about I shove it up your ass?

39:24.153 --> 39:25.863
Now, how'd you know I was into that?

39:25.946 --> 39:27.948
Put your hands behind your back, smartass.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.242
You put your hands
behind your back, motherfucker.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.161
I'm taking this bronze bitch's head off

39:32.244 --> 39:33.996
and ain't a damn thing
you can do about it.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.041
Oh, my God. She's the coolest person
I've ever seen in real life.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.629
Look, kind of a lot of planning 
went into all this.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.464
So I need to complete 
what I started, okay?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.466
Come on, Bowser. Let her go.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.635
This is my job, it's not a hobby.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.011
We're seeing this through.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.681
I'm arresting Henrietta the Eighth here

39:52.765 --> 39:54.100
and turning her in to the court.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.397
But...

40:02.066 --> 40:03.818
I guess there's no extra harm

40:03.901 --> 40:06.612
in letting you finish
cutting off this dude's head

40:06.695 --> 40:08.155
before I take you in.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.532
[sucks air through teeth] Yeah.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.201
Thanks, I appreciate that.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.245
Hey, Clea,

40:14.870 --> 40:15.913
just one question--

40:16.914 --> 40:18.833
Um, why schools?

40:19.542 --> 40:22.128
Because I didn't like that every day,

40:22.336 --> 40:25.089
kids were literally looking up to men
who loved owning people.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.257
Fuck that!

40:26.340 --> 40:27.925
And I don't know if you guys noticed,

40:28.509 --> 40:30.344
but the statues
are in the pattern of a penis,

40:30.594 --> 40:33.139
which is a subtle nod
to institutional patriarchy.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.640
Told ya!

40:35.015 --> 40:35.850
All right.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.352
Hey. Hurry up and finish up your work

40:38.436 --> 40:39.728
so we can take you in.

40:40.855 --> 40:41.772
Will do.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.528
So, you do believe in what she's doing?

40:49.780 --> 40:50.906
I never said I didn't.

40:51.866 --> 40:52.867
[retches]

40:53.784 --> 40:54.660
What's happening?

40:55.244 --> 40:57.163
I'm good. [chuckles] I'm good.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.122
-You good?
-[retches]

40:58.205 --> 40:59.123
-Don't--
-Hey.

41:05.296 --> 41:09.216
Well, we just cannot thank you enough 
for brunch, Debbie.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.053
And what an unforgettable attempt at eggs.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.680
[chuckles]

41:15.431 --> 41:18.225
Well... I suppose that's it, then.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.394
We'll see y'all at Christmas.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.482
I can't wait to see what sort of
bamboo diffuser I'll get this year.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.317
[mother] Mm.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.444
You know what, Big Daddy?

41:29.236 --> 41:30.154
I got something to say.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.656
For years you've been underestimating me,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.493
making me feel small and insignificant.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.954
Well, I've got news for you.

41:39.538 --> 41:41.248
I have been
one of the biggest contributors

41:41.332 --> 41:42.458
to the family business,

41:42.541 --> 41:44.919
and I refuse to go on
getting ignored by you.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.174
So, I quit.

41:50.674 --> 41:51.550
Wait, what?

41:52.051 --> 41:54.428
Well, I have to say,
I'm disappointed to hear that.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.430
I'd hoped to fully retire this year,

41:56.514 --> 41:59.183
and then you and Deacon
would carry on my legacy.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.685
You can take your legacy and stick it...

42:02.436 --> 42:03.562
-[mother gasps]
-Kent.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.189
Mother...

42:06.023 --> 42:08.025
From now on, if you don't have
anything nice to say to my wife,

42:08.108 --> 42:10.361
then don't say anything at all,
if that's okay with you.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.030
-Well, I-- But--
-Come on, Mother.

42:13.739 --> 42:14.573
Let's go.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.558
You just got your husband back,
sugar snap.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.995
-[tires screech]
-[industrial metal music blaring]

43:08.586 --> 43:10.546
You'll have to wait
on the next valet to get back.

43:10.629 --> 43:11.839
My shift just ended.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.966
Oh, no, I'm not here to go to the club.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.844
Um... I'm here to pick you up...

43:17.845 --> 43:19.096
for our real date.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.642
Oh, come on.

43:24.184 --> 43:25.269
Give me another chance.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.230
In my defense,
I did not know you were hot.

43:28.314 --> 43:31.358
You're always wearing
this dork disguise, so...

43:34.987 --> 43:35.946
You think I'm hot?

43:40.034 --> 43:40.993
Let's go, hop in!

43:41.994 --> 43:43.078
[Miles] She thinks I'm hot.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.630
[industrial metal music playing]

43:58.218 --> 44:00.971
Oh, yeah, I listen to industrial
alternative electronic metal.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.057
All right.

44:04.850 --> 44:05.976
[tires screech]

44:09.104 --> 44:12.858
Well, I guess I'm just destined
to walk the world alone.

44:12.941 --> 44:15.694
-Oh, stop it.
-You're not alone. You have me.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.821
-I'll always be there for you.
-[cell phone ringing]

44:17.905 --> 44:20.574
-Thank you.
-Oh, that's Miles. Hey, Miles.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.243
[sighs]

44:32.211 --> 44:33.253
[whispering] She's here.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.965
Sterling, we saw your Instagram story.
You poor thing.

44:37.049 --> 44:40.052
Drinking... at a party...
[whispering] ...with college kids!

44:40.511 --> 44:43.889
You, like,  totally  hit rock bottom.

44:43.972 --> 44:46.308
It wasn't that big a deal.
I mean, I puked, but--

44:46.392 --> 44:47.643
[both gasp]

44:47.726 --> 44:49.103
Well, I'm fine now, so--

44:49.186 --> 44:50.229
[girl] Praise the Lord.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.106
How did you bounce back so quickly?

44:53.315 --> 44:54.483
Um...

44:54.566 --> 44:55.901
Through the power of Christ?

44:57.361 --> 44:58.320
Well...

44:59.279 --> 45:02.491
only when things are darkest
can the Lord's light truly be seen.

45:04.910 --> 45:07.871
You know that feeling you get
when you've sinned so hard

45:07.955 --> 45:10.582
that there's just no repentance
great enough?

45:11.208 --> 45:12.042
No.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.420
Oh, right, only I know what it's like

45:14.503 --> 45:16.964
to have been shepherded
back from the other side

45:17.047 --> 45:18.215
by the Lord, Himself.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.217
How would I describe that?

45:20.300 --> 45:21.218
Um...

45:21.969 --> 45:24.513
When you feel the Lord's hand in yours,

45:24.596 --> 45:27.891
warm and calloused...

45:31.437 --> 45:34.231
there's really nothing like it.
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing...

45:34.314 --> 45:35.941
...warm... calloused--

45:36.859 --> 45:39.361
Oh. Girl, I'm just
gonna stay here with you.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.196
[Sterling continues talking]

45:42.448 --> 45:44.533
You ever read about...

45:44.616 --> 45:45.868
It's really similar to that.

45:45.951 --> 45:49.371
So, should we go ahead
and cancel the grief counselor?

45:49.455 --> 45:51.373
I think we could still get
our deposit back.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.541
Yes, Hannah B...

45:54.042 --> 45:56.170
cancel the grief counselor.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.506
...they land facing the right way

45:59.590 --> 46:02.092
and then you have to drink
all of the liquid inside it.

46:02.426 --> 46:05.471
And that's what got me, friends.
That's what got me.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.768
Je-- Mom! [chuckles]

46:12.102 --> 46:12.978
Drinking...

46:13.854 --> 46:15.814
-at a college party.
-[Sterling sets plate down]

46:16.356 --> 46:19.276
Uh, no, Mom. I was just making a joke--

46:19.693 --> 46:21.403
on-- on social media.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.114
Like, a commentary on our times.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.618
You know, like memes and, um...

46:28.702 --> 46:29.661
Uh...

46:33.373 --> 46:36.043
Sterling, if you want to live
under this roof

46:36.126 --> 46:37.836
then you live under our rules.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.506
And one of our rules is, no drinking.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.842
So, I guess you're not living
under our roof, are you?
