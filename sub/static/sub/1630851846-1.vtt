WEBVTT

00:03.351 --> 00:06.745
So, Danuta, you still haven't
said how you and Marco met.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.052
Oh, no. Here we go.

00:09.096 --> 00:12.751
Well, Marco here is
the reigning champion

00:12.795 --> 00:16.146
on a certain quiz show
on Langley Public Radio.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.018
Oh, you mean <i>Oo Oo, I Know That?</i>

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
A-ding ding dong.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.977
When they asked him

00:21.021 --> 00:22.979
who his favorite
philosopher was,

00:23.023 --> 00:26.722
he said, "I Kant remember."

00:26.765 --> 00:28.593
His wit was bone-dry,

00:28.637 --> 00:31.074
but I was quite the opposite.

00:33.207 --> 00:37.080
Okay, soup.
This time... you're mine.

00:38.299 --> 00:42.259
Ow! That sneaky stuff just falls
off the spoon so fast!

00:42.303 --> 00:44.957
Babe, remember,
flip your spoon <i>over</i>

00:45.001 --> 00:46.437
so it's like a little bowl.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.438
Ohhhhh!

00:47.482 --> 00:49.614
Like a little soup bowl

00:49.658 --> 00:51.094
- on a stick!
- On a stick.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.791
Yes, Jeff. Very good, Jeff.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.619
And how did you two meet?

00:54.663 --> 00:57.579
Oh, it's so hard to recall.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.451
I fell into the touch tank
at the aquarium!

01:00.495 --> 01:01.974
Hayley pulled me out.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.541
Oh, that's right.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.326
We're actually going
to a benefit

01:05.369 --> 01:07.110
at the aquarium
with Johanna this...

01:07.154 --> 01:09.199
Johanna Gurney-Schaffner?!

01:09.243 --> 01:11.593
The host of <i>This Way or That
on Langley Public Radio?!</i>

01:11.636 --> 01:12.985
Wha...?! You hang out with her?!

01:13.029 --> 01:15.205
Oh, she's a dear friend.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.294
We actually went to the new
Almódovar film with her

01:17.338 --> 01:18.426
just last night.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.950
Unngh! Have you seen it?

01:20.993 --> 01:23.996
Oh, I <i>really</i> wanted to,
but Jeff kinda likes to watch

01:24.040 --> 01:25.607
the same movie over and over,

01:25.650 --> 01:27.565
so right now most nights
we're watching

01:27.609 --> 01:30.177
<i>The Secret of Saurus Rock.</i>

01:30.220 --> 01:32.701
Hayley has to explain
a lot of it to me,

01:32.744 --> 01:35.182
but I'm <i>this</i> close
to understanding

01:35.225 --> 01:37.097
that dragons
couldn't actually talk.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.359
Dinosaurs.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.709

What?
What?

02:20.531 --> 02:23.186
Wait just one minute.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.928
You were thinking about

02:25.971 --> 02:27.886
Danuta's smarty-pants boyfriend!

02:27.930 --> 02:29.758
Jeff, I love you. I just...

02:29.801 --> 02:31.934
I can't even remember
the last time

02:31.977 --> 02:34.023
we had an intelligent
conversation about <i>anything!</i>

02:34.066 --> 02:36.852
We talked for hours
about <i>Mad Men!</i>

02:36.895 --> 02:38.680
Because I had to keep explaining

02:38.723 --> 02:40.203
that you didn't
have to be scared,

02:40.247 --> 02:42.162
because the men
weren't mad at <i>you!</i>

02:42.205 --> 02:43.748
Well, maybe you should
watch it with Narco.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.687
- Marco.
- Polo!

02:45.730 --> 02:47.036
Oh, my God!
Why are you so dumb?!

02:48.777 --> 02:51.519
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I-I just got frustrated.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.651
- Where are you going?
- Out!

02:53.695 --> 02:54.957
Jeff, those are <i>my</i> pants.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.569
I know!
I <i>happen</i> to, um...

02:58.613 --> 03:01.746
like the way
they make my butt look!

03:03.400 --> 03:06.708
Jeff! Lookin' <i>good!</i>

03:09.363 --> 03:13.671
Oh, man, what if Hayley leaves
me because I'm too dumb for her?

03:13.715 --> 03:15.630
Who's gonna tie my shoes?!

03:15.673 --> 03:17.980
Hey. Jeffy-boy!

03:18.023 --> 03:19.982
What up, man?
Little moonlight stroll?

03:20.025 --> 03:22.637
Mr. S?
Why are <i>you</i> out so late?

03:22.680 --> 03:25.379
Collectin' critters.
Dr. Weitzman needs animals

03:25.422 --> 03:27.598
for a new experiment
he's doing at the CIA.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.209
The agent
that brings in the most

03:29.252 --> 03:31.211
gets to go to McDonald's
in a limo!

03:31.254 --> 03:32.995
Whoa!

03:33.038 --> 03:35.563
Say, Roger <i>was</i> helping me,
but he quit on me.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.043
Got bit trying to nab
a copperhead snake and just went

03:38.087 --> 03:40.481
straight to the emergency room,
like a quitter.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.524
You wanna help me out?

03:43.962 --> 03:46.791
Mr. S, can I talk to you
about something?

03:46.835 --> 03:48.097
Not if I turn on the radio!

03:51.448 --> 03:54.146
<i>This Way or That
is made possible</i>

03:54.190 --> 03:56.124
<i>by the Arthur and Elaine T.
McKennon Foundation...</i>

03:56.148 --> 03:57.672
Get back here, you little...

03:57.715 --> 03:59.282
<i>...creating

03:59.326 --> 04:00.849

You're coming with me.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.722
<i>...and SmutPile.com.</i>

04:04.766 --> 04:06.550
Check it out. Stray dog.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.032
Can you change the station?

04:10.075 --> 04:13.296
This is that Jo-hannis
Grundy ShniffShnaff lady

04:13.340 --> 04:15.167
Hayley loves so much.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
Ugh! Yeah, I hate
this nerd shit, too.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.955
That nerd Francine
must've been driving my car.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.392
Let's listen to some Stern!

04:22.436 --> 04:24.438
<i>A lotta people don't know this,</i>

04:24.481 --> 04:27.789
<i>but I was high every day
of shootingCity Slickers.</i>

04:27.832 --> 04:29.704
I'm of course talking
about Daniel Stern's

04:29.747 --> 04:31.706
autobiography on Audible.

04:31.749 --> 04:35.536
<i>Also, Jack Palance
was soooo strong.</i>

04:38.190 --> 04:40.367
Well, Misterrrr...

04:40.410 --> 04:41.759
Pastafocaccia.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.501
You seem to have fully recovered
from your snakebite.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.460
So that just leaves
the small matter of...

04:46.503 --> 04:48.331
uh, the bill!

04:49.245 --> 04:53.031
Sweet child o' mine!
Why is it so darn much, Doc?!

04:53.075 --> 04:55.382
Because antivenom is scarce.

04:55.425 --> 04:58.428
Yep, if someone
went out right now

04:58.472 --> 05:00.604
and harvested venom
from poisonous snakes,

05:00.648 --> 05:02.650
which is what antivenom
is made from,

05:02.693 --> 05:05.043
they could make
quite the pretty penny.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.655
- Why are you telling me this?
- I'm a doctor!

05:07.698 --> 05:11.267
I'm <i>all</i> about that sweet
mmmmoney-money-money-money...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
money-money-money-money
money-money-mmmoney!

05:13.356 --> 05:14.618
Hmmm.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.273
"Money, money, money, money,"
you say?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.753
No, like this...

05:18.796 --> 05:20.513
Mmmmoney-money-money-money
money-money-mmmoney!

05:20.537 --> 05:22.800
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah.
Money-money-money-money!

05:22.844 --> 05:24.430
Money-money-money-money
money-money-money!

05:24.454 --> 05:27.283
Money-money-money-money
money-money-money-money!

05:27.327 --> 05:28.893
Now Eskimo kisses!

05:28.937 --> 05:30.852
Money-money-money-money
money-money-money!

05:34.116 --> 05:37.075
Wait here while I run these
bad boys on down to Dr. Dubs.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.643
What kind of experiment is
the doctor working on, anyway?

05:39.687 --> 05:41.384
Eh, some kind of
experimental surgery

05:41.428 --> 05:43.560
to increase intelligence
or some crap.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.432
Do you think
he could do it to me?

05:45.475 --> 05:46.824
Dumb guy like you?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.435
I can see why
you'd be interested.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.350
But he still hasn't perfected
the operation.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.501
Most of these animals'll end up

05:51.525 --> 05:53.483
dimmer than an Amish
Christmas tree.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.661
I like that you screeched
at my joke, wise old owl.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.055
<i>You</i> I might just keep
for myself.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.842
Sure is spooky here after dark.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
Aah! Babadook!

06:08.890 --> 06:12.372
I wish! It's just stupid old me.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.417
I was making ramen
on my hotplate,

06:14.461 --> 06:16.419
and the dang pot
fell on my head.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.030
Oh. Phew!
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

06:19.074 --> 06:20.597
My girlfriend kicked me out!

06:20.641 --> 06:23.774
Aw, that's awful,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.386
Take it from me, kid...
don't ever be in a relationship

06:26.429 --> 06:27.996
with someone smarter than you.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.389
It won't last.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.915
Dr. Wishbone...

06:33.958 --> 06:36.831
I'd like to volunteer
for your a-speriment.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.616
Oh, I would <i>love</i> to have
a human test subject,

06:39.660 --> 06:42.445
but you should know
there's a 99% chance

06:42.489 --> 06:43.881
you'll end up brain-dead.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.841
Uhhh, 99 out of a million?

06:46.884 --> 06:50.627
I think I'll take my chances.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.894
Tell you what, Screechy...

06:56.938 --> 07:00.158
maybe the move is to track down
this beautiful sicko.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.856
Score ten dogs at once.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.077
Dad, have you seen Jeff?
He never came home last night.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.688
Oh, yeah, he volunteered himself

07:07.731 --> 07:10.081
for a deadly experimental
surgery at the CIA.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.736
What?! Why didn't you stop him?!

07:12.780 --> 07:14.651
I guess I don't care
whether he lives or dies.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.261
Ughhh!

07:16.305 --> 07:19.351
- Hoo!
- Jeff.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.880
Stop this atrocity at once!

07:25.923 --> 07:28.186
Oh, Hayley!
I'm glad you're here.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.624
As Jeff's legal guardian,
you need to sign this release

07:30.667 --> 07:32.669
before I can do the operation.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.672
You must be suckin'
the glass if you think

07:35.716 --> 07:38.632
I am gonna give Jeff permission
to go through with this...

07:38.675 --> 07:40.677
"Intelligence Enhancement"?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.723
Out of curiosity,
has this worked

07:42.766 --> 07:44.768
on <i>any</i> of your test animals?

07:44.812 --> 07:47.728
There's one goose
that's now in Mensa.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.514
Did I get it right
this time, Doc?

07:51.558 --> 07:53.647
Oh, if it isn't <i>Babe.</i>

07:53.690 --> 07:55.344
Hopefully here to stop me

07:55.387 --> 07:58.086
from doing this
super-dangerous thing.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.958
- He's all yours, Doc!
- Oh.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.764
H-Hayley?

08:23.807 --> 08:26.636
Dr. Weitzman? Smart Goose?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.682
- Did it work?
- Let's find out.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.858
Which of the little people

08:30.901 --> 08:34.339
is wearing his hospital gown
correctly?

08:34.383 --> 08:36.472
This one.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.083
...seems to have had a bit
of a sartorial snafu.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.129
- Hm?!
- He's taken his "privates"

08:41.172 --> 08:43.087
public, so to speak.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.568
One might even call it an IPO...

08:45.612 --> 08:48.005
an Ignominious
Penile Ostentation.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.966
You can honk <i>that</i> again,
Squawky.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.446
Now, he will need
to avoid marijuana,

08:54.490 --> 08:56.666
which could dull the effects
of the procedure.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.147
I can also tell you <i>
that</i> is a fake diploma.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.931
He's not wrong!

09:03.630 --> 09:06.415
Ah, Mr. Fischer, welcome back!

09:06.458 --> 09:09.461
Shall I bring for you
extra children's menus

09:09.505 --> 09:12.334
so you may attempt the maze
as many times as you like?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.727
<i>Merci, non.</i>

09:13.770 --> 09:15.380
<i>Une bouteille de
Châteauneuf-du-Pape</i>

09:15.424 --> 09:17.295
<i>et du pain pour la table,
s'il vous plaît.</i>

09:17.339 --> 09:19.950
You have
exposed my secret shame.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.736
I am not French,
nor do I speak the language.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.652
Did Jeff take
a ten-gallon Gingko enema

09:25.695 --> 09:28.002
this morning or what?
'Cause he seems, like,

09:28.045 --> 09:29.960
a billion times smarter
than he used to be.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.962
I know! Isn't it great?

09:32.006 --> 09:34.661
<i>Per te, amore mio.</i>

09:34.704 --> 09:36.880
Say what you will about Seurat.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.839
No one can accuse his art
of being...

09:38.882 --> 09:39.970
pointless.

09:41.058 --> 09:44.235
That is so witty,
it's almost funny.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.890
You know, Johanna is hosting
a small fundraiser

09:46.934 --> 09:49.632
for the McKennon Foundation
at her lake house this weekend.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.591
You guys should come.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.594
As they say in Reykjavík...

09:59.773 --> 10:01.426
What he said.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.083
So, by now, Barry's going back

10:06.127 --> 10:07.452
to the Steve Madden
a <i>third</i> time...

10:07.476 --> 10:08.912
Shh, shh, shut up!

10:08.956 --> 10:10.871
Your story sucks,
and I hear a rattler.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.484
Oingo boingo! We got cornbread!

10:15.527 --> 10:17.660
Here. Take some clackers
and work that string bean

10:17.704 --> 10:18.966
on outta there.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.881
What?! Why would I do <i>that?!</i>

10:20.924 --> 10:22.752
Because I'm Chazz Babylon,

10:22.796 --> 10:25.015
Speculative Venom Harvester.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.495
And you're my bag man.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.715
You told me you were
Chico Dungaree,

10:28.758 --> 10:30.804
Former Twisted Sister Roadie,

10:30.847 --> 10:32.849
and that we were just
going on a nature walk!

10:32.893 --> 10:34.808
Chazz Babylon
is a pathological liar.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.070
Now get clackin'!

10:36.113 --> 10:37.811
I will not!

10:37.854 --> 10:39.726
The world needs antivenom,
Steve.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.858
Think of how many lives
we'll save.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.382
All right. We can <i>try.</i>

10:44.426 --> 10:46.689
Okay, now first we gotta
clack him outta that bush.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.345
Now hold up a second.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.955
I wanna make sure
we got a good one.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.089
Ow! It's him!
And he nipped me!

10:55.132 --> 10:56.786
- Oh, my God!
- I got nipped!

10:56.830 --> 10:58.353
Quick, grab his tail!

10:59.746 --> 11:02.139
Ohh, he's mad now!
Oh, he nipped me again!

11:02.183 --> 11:05.142
- I got nipped! You get nipped?
- Ohh! Yow! I got nipped!

11:05.186 --> 11:05.926
- I got nipped!
- I'm gettin' nipped!

11:05.969 --> 11:07.318
- Ohh! Ow! Oww!
- Ohh!

11:07.362 --> 11:08.731
I'm gettin' nipped
a whole bunch right now!

11:08.755 --> 11:10.365
Ow! Let's bag this sucker!

11:10.408 --> 11:12.454
Get him in there! Aah!

11:12.497 --> 11:14.499
I'm trying!

11:18.199 --> 11:19.983
Ah! We did it, Steve.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.161
Oh, my God.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.947
He doesn't have his clackers.
He's doomed!

11:30.602 --> 11:32.953
Wife. Noun.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.782
A woman who regrets a decision.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.091
What then of "husband"?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.354
The man who begets her derision.

11:44.834 --> 11:48.708
More snaps! More snaps for you!

11:48.751 --> 11:51.188
Jeff, we simply have to have you

11:51.232 --> 11:53.364
as a contestant on <i>
Oo Oo, I Know That.</i>

11:53.408 --> 11:55.236
Johanna's going to be
a guest panelist.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.933
What do you say, Johanna?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.152
Certainly.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.284
So long as he helps me
with this devil

12:00.328 --> 12:02.460
of a <i>New Yorker</i> caption contest.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.375
Any suggestions?

12:04.419 --> 12:05.899
Hmm.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.249
How about,
"I've heard of a bull market,

12:08.292 --> 12:09.903
but <i>this</i> is ridiculous"?

12:11.426 --> 12:15.560
Or, "Of <i>course</i> on the day
I wear my red tie."

12:15.604 --> 12:19.347
Or, "Everybody <i>has</i> been
saying the new guy is horny."

12:19.390 --> 12:21.349
"Think that belt
is real leather?"

12:21.392 --> 12:23.612
"I heard this place
had fresh beef,

12:23.655 --> 12:25.919
but <i>this</i> is ridiculous!"

12:28.617 --> 12:30.227
Now you do one, babe.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.057
Uhhhhhhh...

12:34.101 --> 12:37.539
Business... bull?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.125
- Ugh. That's just...
- That doesn't quite connect.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.629
- Nice try, but...
- Very, very bad.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.510
What th... A weed gummy?!

12:52.554 --> 12:55.122
You know that could affect
my treatment!

12:55.165 --> 12:57.515
Oh, my God!
A-Are you trying to...

12:57.559 --> 12:59.343
sabotage me?!

12:59.387 --> 13:01.824
<i>Playing "Rabbitage" by Weird Al.</i>

13:01.868 --> 13:03.608
♪ <i>I'll nab cabbage</i> ♪

13:03.652 --> 13:05.349
- Alexa, off!
- ♪ <i>And do my da...</i> ♪

13:05.393 --> 13:07.656
You know,
Johanna was right about you.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.093
You are pathologically insecure!

13:10.137 --> 13:13.009
Wh... You've been talking
to Johanna about us?

13:13.053 --> 13:15.533
First you risk my life
to make me smarter,

13:15.577 --> 13:18.449
now you nearly kill me
trying to dumb me back down?!

13:18.493 --> 13:20.016
I'm sorry, Jeff!

13:20.060 --> 13:22.212
I-I was scared you were getting
too smart for me and...

13:22.236 --> 13:23.846
But I should thank you.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.935
Because now that I am smart,

13:25.979 --> 13:29.417
I finally see what
a selfish person you are.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.332
No, Jeff, please don't see that!

13:31.375 --> 13:32.768
I never cared you weren't

13:32.812 --> 13:35.292
the most erudite person
in the world.

13:35.336 --> 13:39.557
But I can't be with someone
who's downright flagitious!

13:43.213 --> 13:45.259
- F-L...
- It means "villainous"!

13:45.302 --> 13:47.827
I know what it means!

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
Well, Screechy, he did it.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.531
He won the Tournament
of Champions.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.662
Hoo.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.621
Don't make me say his name,
Screech.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.841
Hayley, honey?

14:01.884 --> 14:04.408
The ice-cream truck
just came by.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.759
I got you one of those
[bleep]-up Sonic the Hedgehogs.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.849
Thanks, Mom.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.589
You've just seemed so sad

14:11.633 --> 14:14.157
these last few months
since Jeff left.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.811
No, we've both moved on.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.682
He's with Johanna now,

14:17.726 --> 14:21.338
and I'm happy
with my new boyfriend ...ron.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.037
Dahhh! Hey, Hayley! Lookit!

14:24.080 --> 14:26.953
I knocked it right outta
its nest with a rock

14:26.996 --> 14:29.564
from all the way a long ways!

14:29.607 --> 14:31.218
Like, ungh!

14:31.261 --> 14:34.134
Myron! You're gonna get
West Nile again!

14:34.177 --> 14:36.919
Aww! You got a Sonic bar?!
Gimme!

14:38.486 --> 14:40.488
Let's go to the old tire factory

14:40.531 --> 14:42.882
and whip this bird
against the big rock!

14:49.584 --> 14:52.761
I wish Stan would
take <i>me</i> places.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.024
Waaaaah! Rock-throw!

14:55.068 --> 14:56.678
Million points!

14:56.721 --> 14:59.507
Hey, Hayley! You see that?

14:59.550 --> 15:01.335
Yes, Myron. Very good, Myron.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.381
♪ <i>I'll nab cabbage and...</i> ♪

15:04.425 --> 15:06.731
Gouda Tenuta, what's nuts?

15:06.775 --> 15:09.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.953
Marco's been missing
for <i>how</i> long?

15:13.216 --> 15:15.566
Listen, I've been doing
a lot of research.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.960
Every male winner of
the Tournament of Champions

15:18.004 --> 15:20.397
has gone missing
a few weeks later.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.747
And it has something to do
with the McKennon Foundation.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.272
Oh, Hayley, conspiracy theories

15:25.315 --> 15:27.709
are the refuge
of the dispossessed.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.798
Kava root ristretto?

15:29.841 --> 15:32.975
Jeff, please. I think you
may be in some kind of danger.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.716
Only of losing my patience!

15:34.759 --> 15:36.979
Clearly,
you've transmuted your guilt

15:37.023 --> 15:38.676
over destroying our relationship

15:38.720 --> 15:40.678
into this absurd fairy tale.

15:40.722 --> 15:44.117
Well, enough.
It is over between us.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.736
Forget about her, lover.

15:54.779 --> 15:58.174
A brighter future awaits us.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.307
Let's play at puns.

16:00.350 --> 16:03.005
"Air Hare." Ten letters.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.876
Hmm. Kite Rabbit?

16:04.920 --> 16:08.054
Close.
But the answer is actually...

16:08.097 --> 16:09.925
Ether bunny!

16:09.969 --> 16:14.451
Come now, Jeff. Destiny calls.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.109
Wakey, wakey! Milk some snakeys!

16:20.153 --> 16:22.807
Time to get out there again,
right back on the horse.

16:22.851 --> 16:23.983
Clack clack clack!

16:24.026 --> 16:26.463
You must be suckin' the glass

16:26.507 --> 16:28.552
if you think
I'm going back out with you.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.250
You were never out
to save lives.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.991
You just wanted to make money.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.533
It may have started out
being about the money,

16:33.557 --> 16:34.950
but not anymore.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.908
Well, maybe a little.
I did sink quite a bit

16:36.952 --> 16:38.954
into having
all these T-shirts made.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.218
But otherwise,
now it's all about saving lives.

16:42.262 --> 16:45.265
I won't rest
until every snakebite victim

16:45.308 --> 16:46.875
has the antivenom they need!

16:48.485 --> 16:49.485
Aah!

16:50.705 --> 16:51.749
Aah!

16:52.576 --> 16:56.319
Aah!

16:56.363 --> 16:58.321
Aah! Aah!

17:00.628 --> 17:01.933
Aah!

17:01.977 --> 17:04.066
I'm afraid
you've single-handedly

17:04.110 --> 17:06.851
depleted the world's
entire supply of antivenom.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.941
Many have died,
and now you will, too.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.596
Clack's all... folks.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.165
My Chazz!

17:16.209 --> 17:17.819
Noooooooo!

17:19.212 --> 17:22.998
The <i>Meisterzucht</i> awakes!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.652
Wh-Where am I?

17:24.695 --> 17:28.047
At the threshold of a new age.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.396
Welcome...

17:29.439 --> 17:32.181
to the McKennon Foundation!

17:32.225 --> 17:34.140
Why are you doing this?!

17:34.183 --> 17:37.012
Why, to create
a brighter generation,

17:37.056 --> 17:40.711
free of dumdums,
dingdongs, <i>and</i> dingalings.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.627
We use <i>Oo Oo, I Know That</i>

17:43.671 --> 17:47.109
to identify intellects
of the highest genetic caliber,

17:47.153 --> 17:49.633
then harvest their seed to be...

17:49.677 --> 17:51.461
disseminated...

17:53.333 --> 17:56.379
Pun uh-very much intended.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.556
...to fertility clinics
the world over!

17:59.600 --> 18:04.735
And you, Jeff, you are
the most smartest one of all!

18:04.779 --> 18:06.476
Der Meisterzucht!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.739
The Master Stud!

18:08.783 --> 18:10.567
Commence milking!

18:15.224 --> 18:17.226
Yaaaaaaawwww! You might think
this would feel good,

18:17.270 --> 18:19.533
but it's agonyyyyyy!

18:25.060 --> 18:27.715
Ready the Meisterzucht
for harvest!

18:27.758 --> 18:30.500
Wait! No! No! Listen!
My genes are useless to you.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.286
My intelligence stems
from biomedical intervention!

18:33.329 --> 18:35.940
Uh, you don't think we already
tried that old chestnut...

18:35.984 --> 18:38.160
My balls!

18:39.205 --> 18:41.424
Milk the Meisterzucht!

18:44.123 --> 18:47.474
Yah, Myron! Yah!

18:48.823 --> 18:51.130
Myron! Attack!

18:51.173 --> 18:53.175
Rock! Bird! Bird!

18:53.219 --> 18:54.481
Rock! Rat!

18:56.047 --> 18:58.180
Let's get outta here.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.884
You came for me.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.452
Even though it means
now you'll die, too.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.801
What can I say?

19:10.845 --> 19:13.108
I think my problem
all along has been,

19:13.152 --> 19:17.068
when it comes to you,
I'm just a great big dummy.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.941
We gotta think of a way
out of here.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.832
But those are some of
the most intelligent people

19:21.856 --> 19:23.031
in the world out there.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.598
We'll never outsmart them!

19:24.641 --> 19:27.601
No. But we may be able
to <i>outstupid</i> them.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.386
I need to be dumb again,
so I can think up a plan

19:30.430 --> 19:32.693
so stupid
they could <i>never</i> expect it.

19:32.736 --> 19:35.043
How?! We don't have any weed!

19:35.086 --> 19:38.264
The answer's as easy
as autolobotomy.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.924
Have you ever wondered
what the colors on maps mean?

19:46.968 --> 19:49.057
They gotta mean something.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.146
Quick, what's your stupid plan?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.845
Since Vaseline is clear,

19:54.889 --> 19:57.021
once we cover ourselves in it...

19:57.065 --> 19:59.720
...we become absolutely,

19:59.763 --> 20:02.549
one-million-percent invisible.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.508
Oh, wow. This <i>is</i> stupid.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.423
Seize them!

20:08.946 --> 20:11.122
Ugh!

20:12.689 --> 20:15.301
Uch! They're too damn slippery!

20:15.344 --> 20:17.477
Whoo!

20:23.613 --> 20:26.921
The Spank Tank!

20:26.964 --> 20:29.053
All our precious seed!

20:38.585 --> 20:40.500
<i>C'mon, Snugglesaurus.</i>

20:40.543 --> 20:43.154
<i>We can still make it
to the Great Valley.</i>

20:43.198 --> 20:44.330
You know what I'm wondering?

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114
If we maybe should've
tried to save

20:46.157 --> 20:47.463
those other men
in that basement?

20:47.507 --> 20:48.769
No.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.119
Do you think all the dino-snaurs
stayed friends

20:51.162 --> 20:52.947
when they were done
shooting the movie?

20:52.990 --> 20:55.906
Babe, don't ever change.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.865
Have a great night!
