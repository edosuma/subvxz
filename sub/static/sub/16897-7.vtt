WEBVTT

01:08.443 --> 01:10.992
Get it going. Come on, lady.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.747
Whoa! Ha, ha!

01:13.448 --> 01:15.997
Show me what you got. Uh-huh.
- Ha, ha. Okay, I got nothing.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.161
That's what I'm gonna show you.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.874
- You've totally done this before.
- Richard!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.589
- Richard! Hey, hey, hey!
- Baby, I like what I see.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.879
Look at that. I can do that.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.345
- It's all in the ankles.
- Ankles? I'm so sure.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.508
Richard!

01:31.675 --> 01:33.677
- No, no. Aah!
- I'll show you. Come here.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.063
- Spin around.
- Richard.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.349
Richard.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.192
Unh!

01:42.561 --> 01:45.656
- Damn it.
- I'm gonna go see if she's okay. Okay?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.361
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.784
Fuck.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.622
Ray, 25 times I've called you.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.454
- Did you think it was urgent?
- I texted you back.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.619
Yeah, well,
"I'm ice-skating with a client."

01:58.785 --> 02:00.662
- it's not good enough.
- What do you mean?

02:00.829 --> 02:03.503
We woke up and decided to go out.
What's the big deal?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.633
So wait, you spent the night...

02:05.792 --> 02:08.261
- ...with her?
- Yeah.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.926
How did that go?

02:14.092 --> 02:16.561
It went just fine, Tanya. She's very nice.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.848
We had a good time. I think she's sweet.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.358
I fell asleep. Why?

02:21.516 --> 02:24.110
Did you have sex with Kyla?
I'm guessing you didn't.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.988
But you didn't, right?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.533
Why are you asking me?

02:30.609 --> 02:32.202
What?
I... Would you listen?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.989
L... I have-u

02:36.782 --> 02:40.958
I have reason to believe
that Kyla is a man.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.247
Okay?

02:44.206 --> 02:46.459
I'm pretty sure she's a man.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.301
Are you out of your mind?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.341
- What reason?
- Lenore told me.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.260
Lenore? Ha!

02:56.426 --> 02:59.646
Yeah. She's fucking with you.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.353
- How do you know?
- I know. How do I know?

03:02.974 --> 03:06.524
Because I know.
Lenore is a nutcase. You...

03:06.687 --> 03:08.280
Everything's fine.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.692
I am sure this lady is a woman.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.281
Okay? All right?

03:14.444 --> 03:18.119
Okay, Ray, if you say so.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.293
Look out, here I come. â€œmoo!
- Ha, ha, ha!

03:24.663 --> 03:26.791
<i>If there's one thing I know in my life...</i>

03:26.957 --> 03:29.005
<i>It's a woman when I see one.</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:33.638
Ooh, you got us hot chocolate.
Great. I'm freezing.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.995
Are you all right?

04:01.241 --> 04:04.586
So, Kyla...

04:05.704 --> 04:09.299
ahem, tell me about yourself.
I don't know anything about you.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.427
- Do you like sports?
- Me?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.714
- No.
- That's... That's good.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.382
Yeah. Ahem.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.559
So last night when you...

04:23.847 --> 04:26.942
You know, did...

04:27.642 --> 04:31.522
whatever and then, um...

04:33.023 --> 04:36.994
This morning, when you didn't
want to do anything...

04:38.445 --> 04:41.824
why is that, when you're paying me?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.788
Well, isn't it obvious?

04:44.576 --> 04:47.876
- No.
- I wanted to wait.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.758
Huh.

04:59.257 --> 05:04.514
You know what?
I just remembered I got this other thing.

05:04.679 --> 05:09.355
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, it's... it's... Oh, I feel like...

05:10.227 --> 05:12.901
Vertigo. Nothing to do with you.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.532
L... Call Tanya, okay?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.113
I'll call you.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.374
And that's Candace, from the bakery.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.333
She was hot for Jason, so I told her
that she could do it if she paid.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.248
And I met those two ladies at Arby's.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.919
- Arby's?
- Yeah, it's Pam and Martha.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.804
I know they're a little bow-wow,
but money is money, right?

05:37.963 --> 05:40.386
And I have lots of ideas
I wanted to share with you.

05:40.549 --> 05:44.224
Guys, guys, guys.
I appreciate the enthusiasm...

05:44.386 --> 05:48.607
but in general, Sandee, Arby's is not okay.
We're operating close to the line here.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.938
- Close to what line?
- The illegal line, Sandee.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.024
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.110
Don't invite too many randoms
to fuck the ho's.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.326
Hey, dude.
- Okay, can I talk to you for a second?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.987
Sure.

06:02.153 --> 06:06.499
Okay. Ray, Kyla called.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.251
I asked her.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.380
What did she say?

06:13.832 --> 06:16.255
She said she thought you knew.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.921
Lenore was supposed to tell you.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.553
She thought I knew?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.184
Well, look,
she can still be a great client.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.561
She wants you to take her to a reunion.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.810
- I am not...
- No, don't.

06:29.973 --> 06:34.149
- I am not fucking a guy, Tanya.
- No, you don't have to fuck anyone, Ray.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.734
You'll get 1000 bucks
just to be an escort.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.948
Get what's-his-name to do it.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.906
She likes you, and your money was stolen.
It's a great job.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.493
I don't need this job, Tanya. There's
a roomful of real women out there...

06:45.655 --> 06:48.124
and they've got real vaginae.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.376
Let's go get them.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.841
Well, hi, ladies.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.218
It's exciting to see all the new faces.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.925
Hi, Martha. Hey, hi, Pam.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.930
Welcome. Uh...

07:03.089 --> 07:06.263
All right, today's subject is choice...

07:06.426 --> 07:09.020
because choice leads to freedom.

07:09.179 --> 07:13.355
And freedom around here
equals orgasmic living.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
So now we just hang out back here?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.479
Yeah.
- For how long?

07:17.646 --> 07:20.115
Till she calls for the Samson file.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.570
- Who's Samson?
- Nobody is Samson.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.239
- It's a fake file.
- On that note...

07:29.699 --> 07:33.545
It is pretty cool we get paid
to fuck, huh, man?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.046
Yeah.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.629
You used to be a teacher, right?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.669
Still a teacher.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.842
Jake, Richard, will you please
bring out the Samson file?

07:57.102 --> 07:58.479
Thanks.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.942
Thank you, Jake.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.780
Thanks.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.845
This is great. Jason, you got five ladies.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.301
- What?
- Well, that's great.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.636
I mean, it's the novelty factor, Ray.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.678
That makes sense.
Two new clients, it's really... It's good.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.265
How did I only get two?

08:32.429 --> 08:35.102
Plus, we're gonna add that tranny.
That makes six.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.683
Oh, now they got six.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.775
You're gonna send that clown to Kyla,
on top of everything else?

08:40.937 --> 08:45.693
You told me to send him.
You said you couldn't handle it.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.533
I can handle it.
I can handle Kyla just fine.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.493
Put me in there.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.368
That makes three.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.791
<i>- Hey.
- Where are you?</i>

09:00.957 --> 09:02.550
I'm at...

09:02.709 --> 09:04.211
I'm at my apartment.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.597
I'm at your apartment. I just knocked.
You didn't answer.

09:07.756 --> 09:11.101
Oh, well, I'm at my other apartment.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.513
It's the... it's the old one. I'm sorry.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.977
I'm having a lot of trouble
hearing you right now.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.690
<i>- It's bad to fuck with me.
- What? The reception is...</i>

09:20.852 --> 09:24.698
It's awful. And I can barely hear...
And I can barely hear you.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.918
- We want to diversify.
- I'm sorry?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.502
Video.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.625
WOMAN Fuck me.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.841
Wait, I'm not following.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.300
Porn.

09:49.714 --> 09:54.595
Okay, Sandee, porn is not okay with me.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.894
- Wait, what's wrong with porn?
- What's wrong with porn?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.309
Porn is the male gaze?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.941
When sex is filmed
by a male pornographer...

10:04.104 --> 10:06.607
- ...women are commodified.
- That's the point, right?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.652
That's not the point.
The point is happiness.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.537
Okay, but Jason is fucking
these women anyway.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.823
So we film it.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.912
And then we post it on the Internet.

10:17.075 --> 10:21.296
We can't film the clients and post it
on the Internet without their permission.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.175
We can blur their faces. I already have
the domain name and everything.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.462
It's MyFianceIsAWhore.com.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.017
Do you have a bathroom
that I could use?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.348
They're grifters. They're pornographers.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.885
They're thieves.
Who have I gotten into bed with?

11:17.051 --> 11:19.975
- What have I done?
- You sure they've got Ray's box?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.186
Because a lot of people
got red shoeboxes.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.942
They had thousands of dollars
worth of stereo equipment.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.853
I mean, how could they afford that?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.614
- I say let it alone.
- What?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.400
You say women are signing up
like crazy for this kid.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.240
And he's making you a lot of money.

11:34.402 --> 11:38.873
<i>I say as long as he's not
stealing from you, let it slide.</i>

11:39.032 --> 11:40.784
Sometimes ho's steal.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.294
They're not nuns. They ho's.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.548
You want me to do nothing
because they're not stealing from me'?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.549
Yeah.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.049
I can't do that. The guilt, Charlie.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.761
Baby, are you asking for my advice
or for my help?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.436
Ahem.

12:07.352 --> 12:11.528
You know, I...
I have a son who might be gay.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.108
Yeah.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.867
Seventeen years old. Yeah, it's just, phew.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.790
I love him, though. Mm-hm.

12:21.115 --> 12:24.460
It don't matter to me. I love my gay son.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.417
Or maybe-gay son.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.252
I'm not gay...

12:29.791 --> 12:32.260
- Okay.
- I'm a woman, Ray.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.137
Sure. That's cool.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.019
So when did that start for you?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.180
- Being a woman?
- Mm-hm

12:44.347 --> 12:45.894
When did you start being a man?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.115
- Aaah!
- Hey, hey, hey! Who the fuck?

12:59.153 --> 13:03.909
Hi, guys. Sandee, you know Charlie.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.077
- Hey.
- You guys met.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.372
- Can I get some water?
- What?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.040
Some, you know, water.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.300
- We have some Gatorade.
- That'll do.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.506
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.797
Okay.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.094
Okay.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.682
What are you doing?
- Wait, wait, wait. Charlie!

13:22.844 --> 13:24.391
Oh, no. Hey, hey, hey!

13:25.013 --> 13:26.606
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.357
Just like that.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.935
Oh, Charlie.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.398
No. Please, stop.
- What the eff, man'!

13:35.565 --> 13:36.908
Come on, man, sit down.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.195
Okay, look, wait.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.365
Nobody is drawing any conclusions.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.579
Okay? Look.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.211
Guys, I was here earlier...

13:48.369 --> 13:51.999
and I couldn't help but notice
that you have a red shoebox...

13:52.165 --> 13:54.167
in your bathroom
and it had money in it.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.463
- That's where we keep our money.
- Just listen to the lady, please.

13:59.422 --> 14:04.178
The thing is, Ray had an identical
red shoebox stolen from his house.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.814
- You think we stole Ray's shoebox?
- I don't know. I'm asking.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.270
Did you steal Ray's shoebox?

14:10.433 --> 14:15.530
No. We didn't... We don't even know
where he lives. That is our shoebox.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.365
I don't know, what are the odds, two people
both having red Puma shoeboxes...

14:21.527 --> 14:23.700
- ...hidden in their house?
- They're very high.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.912
People have red shoeboxes.
Everyone has got them!

14:27.075 --> 14:28.873
Red shoeboxes are everywhere.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.169
Charlie.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.624
- Charlie. No, no, no.
- Hey, is anybody hungry?

14:34.791 --> 14:38.466
- We didn't take the money!
- Charlie, that's a live turtle. It's a pet.

14:38.628 --> 14:42.724
- Please don't eat Prince Eric!
- Tell me how this is gonna go then...

14:42.882 --> 14:46.807
because I don't have time for this shit.
Tanya don't have time for this shit.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.644
And this... "Prince Eric," you say?
He really does not have time for this shit.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.184
Okay, okay, okay!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.853
- Okay, what?
- We took the money.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.442
- No, we didn't.
- We took it, we took it!

14:58.272 --> 14:59.740
Okay.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.077
Tanya is gonna arrange a plan...

15:03.236 --> 15:06.490
so that you nice people
can make amends.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.124
Thank you.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.836
Let's go, baby.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.138
Let's do this.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.404
Oh, my God!

15:46.529 --> 15:51.456
Adam? Adam Philips?
Hey, it's me.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.086
Good to see you.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.667
Hi.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.504
Yeah, good to see you.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.668
Oh, Adam, this is my fiancÃ©, Ray.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.679
Ray, this is Adam.
We had English class together junior year.

16:03.838 --> 16:07.513
- Hi, how you doing?
- God, it seems like forever, huh? Ha, ha!

16:10.011 --> 16:12.139
- Excuse us for a second.
- Oh.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.270
What are you doing?
- What?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.901
Tone it down, okay?
Don't rock the boat.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.357
- I thought you wanted to pass.
- I am passing, Ray.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.864
- He can't tell who I was.
- You keep pushing it...

16:22.023 --> 16:23.866
somebody is gonna notice.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.238
Oh, shit.
- What?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.372
Take care of yourself. You better call me.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.499
- That's him.
- Who?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.501
Come on, let's dance.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.504
Oh, that's... That's okay.
I'm not a good dancer.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.415
You danced at my house.
You've got moves.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.926
No, no,
I don't feel like dancing right now.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.337
It's a reunion. People dance.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.553
Okay, I... That's not part of the deal.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.103
What the hell is your problem?
Tanya said you'd be fine.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.764
Look, I don't have to be here, okay?

16:54.931 --> 16:58.231
- Look, this isn't something that-
- What are you talking about?

16:58.392 --> 17:01.066
I mean, look, I'm helping you out here.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.607
You know? I mean,
a lot of guys wouldn't after...

17:04.022 --> 17:06.992
- Oh, you're mad because I blew you?
- Shh!

17:08.361 --> 17:12.241
Okay, lam so, so sorry...

17:12.406 --> 17:16.036
that this whole experience
that I am paying you for...

17:16.202 --> 17:19.705
has been difficult for you.
You know what?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.589
Fuck off.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.769
I'm really glad you picked up
the phone, Jess.

17:47.692 --> 17:52.038
Turn off that fucking music
or I will staple your dick to your face!

17:56.367 --> 17:57.744
Hm.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.168
I'm sorry I've been a shitty friend, Jess.
Been a rough couple of months.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.677
Yes.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.088
For me too.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.178
But things are... Things are looking up.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.469
I've been going to this place
and it's really helping me.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.182
Okay, just-.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.690
Don't laugh.

18:20.641 --> 18:25.488
But there's this... This woman. This...

18:26.647 --> 18:30.948
- Healer. And she runs a wellness center.
- Mm-hm.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.034
She's very inspirational.

18:35.990 --> 18:39.995
They have open classes, if you wanna...

18:42.163 --> 18:43.915
Yeah!

19:16.906 --> 19:20.661
- It's like that ball was coated in butter.
- Not fair. Asshole dropped the ball.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.579
Anyways, to the District 4
state championships.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.669
To the District 4 state championships.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.504
Fuck the ump!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.920
- You guys were District 4?
- Yeah.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.217
You play?

19:32.380 --> 19:35.099
Yeah, I was at West Lakefield High.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.804
No shit.
- Class of '84.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.846
Oh, West Lakefield.
You were good then.

19:40.012 --> 19:45.143
Oh, yeah.
No, we won the states in '83 and '84.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.314
Oh, wait, you're not...
Are you Ray Drecker?

19:49.814 --> 19:52.363
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.527
Man, my brother played against you.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.947
Weren't you drafted by the Braves?

19:57.113 --> 20:00.208
- Once upon a time, yeah.
- Oh, shit, man, you could fucking play.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.789
I'm telling you, you could play.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.625
What are you doing here?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.542
My fiancÃ©e's...

20:10.334 --> 20:11.677
There.

20:20.136 --> 20:25.063
- I can't believe I don't remember you.
- You look exactly the same.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.817
You think so?

20:26.976 --> 20:30.776
I look in the mirror and I see
this old guy standing behind me.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.906
Plus, I'm getting a divorce.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.658
So I'm a mess.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.120
Are you here with someone?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.581
No.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.873
Holy shit.

20:49.039 --> 20:53.761
Hey, you see that girl?
I swear to God, man, that is Dan Drummel.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.801
No.
- Yes.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.217
- The chick in the dress, that's Dan Drummel?
- Yes.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.680
Dan fucking Drummel.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.390
- That is Dan Drummel.
- No.

21:02.553 --> 21:06.433
Oh, shit! Dan Drummers your fiancÃ©e?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.773
No. No, my fiancÃ©e is...

21:09.935 --> 21:12.029
You know, like over... Over...

21:12.188 --> 21:14.782
- Look at him.
- Fuck, yeah, ha, ha, ha!

21:16.192 --> 21:17.318
<i>I saw it happen.</i>

21:17.485 --> 21:18.828
- She's a dude.
- Oh.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.577
<i>She was Kyla...</i>

21:22.072 --> 21:24.825
<i>- ...and then, in a second...
- You're kidding me.</i>

21:24.992 --> 21:28.212
<i>- ...she wasn't.
- You know who she just saw?</i>

21:42.218 --> 21:44.061
What the fuck are you doing?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.647
Not cool.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.560
Not cool.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.712
<i>Ana' I wasn't Ray Breaker
to them anymore.</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:13.249
<i>I was just a guy
with the wrong kind of girl.</i>

22:14.834 --> 22:16.586
Oh, shit.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.720
Take me home.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.095
I want to go fucking home.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.606
See you, Dan.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.070
Kyla. Kyla.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.659
- Come here.
- I never should've come back here.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.320
No, no, no. Don't say that.
That's not true, Kyla.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.282
Will you look at me?

22:46.532 --> 22:49.035
Will you...? Will you look at me, please?

22:51.120 --> 22:54.169
We didn't come all the way out here...

22:54.331 --> 22:57.050
to turn around and go home. Right?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.296
L...

23:01.213 --> 23:03.807
Okay, I know you want to dance.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.266
Well, I want to dance too.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.189
- Liar.
- No, no, really, I do.

23:10.347 --> 23:14.397
I love dancing. I can't get enough of it.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.814
Come on. Hey.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.701
Fuck these guys.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.796
You're beautiful. You hear me?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.090
You're beautiful.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.469
Come on, let's dance.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.878
Hey, Charlie?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.089
Charlie?

25:21.145 --> 25:24.900
<i>When you're young, you get all
worked up about what people think of you.</i>

25:25.065 --> 25:27.818
<i>But that's the good thing
about getting older.</i>

25:27.985 --> 25:30.704
<i>You realize, "Fuck that.</i>

25:30.863 --> 25:32.957
<i>It's what you think of yourself."</i>
