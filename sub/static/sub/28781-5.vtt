WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.160
<i>I have a plan to save Lyta,</i>

00:05.330 --> 00:06.750
<i>to kill Dru-Zod.</i>

00:07.460 --> 00:09.420
If I'm to join you
against Zod

00:09.590 --> 00:10.870
and Lyta gets in the way,

00:11.090 --> 00:12.450
I need to know
what you're willing to do.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.830
I honestly don't know.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.880
You're sending me up there.
To Wegthor.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.640
<i>You are the most
valuable person to me.</i>

00:19.810 --> 00:21.470
<i>When this reconditioning
is complete,</i>

00:21.640 --> 00:23.130
<i>you'll be a different person.</i>

00:25.060 --> 00:26.770
What have you done?

00:27.440 --> 00:29.850
Reconditioning complete.
He's done.

00:30.190 --> 00:33.110
<i>Can you hear me, Seg-El?</i>

00:39.160 --> 00:40.190
Take it from someone who's

00:40.370 --> 00:42.030
been in your
position before, Lyta.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.620
There is never a "we"
when it comes to power.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.280
There is only
the last one standing.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.620
For helping us capture
the oxygenators,

00:48.710 --> 00:52.290
we owe a great deal
of gratitude to Nyssa-Vex.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.590
It's a smart weapon.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.120
If the wrong hands
got hold of it--

00:57.300 --> 00:58.630
It could mean genocide.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.300
Detonate on my command only.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.140
<i>Ground forces, move in!</i>

01:06.310 --> 01:07.770
The oxygenators are failing.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.470
<i>Zod's tainted the supply.</i>

01:09.650 --> 01:11.510
<i>Detonate the Codex Weapon!</i>

01:11.690 --> 01:14.020
No!

01:15.070 --> 01:16.310
<i>Val, what did you do?</i>

01:16.490 --> 01:17.440
What did you do?

01:17.950 --> 01:19.940
<i>You should have told me
what you were planning.</i>

01:21.330 --> 01:22.440
What the hell is this?

01:23.950 --> 01:25.740
The end of the war.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.360
<i>The mission was a success.</i>

02:06.540 --> 02:08.699
<i>Initial body count suggests
over 50%</i>

02:08.870 --> 02:10.460
<i>of their ground forces
were wiped out.</i>

02:11.210 --> 02:13.040
<i>Will update further
after the solar flare.</i>

02:13.500 --> 02:15.090
Good, by the time
that's finished,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.590
there should be
no resistance left to speak of.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.150
Hello, son.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.410
Father.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.090
Call for help
and you will die.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.130
Do not doubt it.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.110
You know, you should
have a word

03:25.280 --> 03:26.520
with those guards of yours.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.320
They just let me walk right in.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.830
Maybe you told them a different
Seg was gonna show up.

03:35.460 --> 03:36.420
Someone a bit more...

03:37.550 --> 03:38.660
conditioned, perhaps?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.080
Looks like your plan
to rewire my brain

03:41.260 --> 03:42.590
didn't turn out
the way you expected.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.970
You don't say?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.720
You know, for someone
with such a grand vision,

03:47.260 --> 03:48.630
you probably should have
seen this coming.

03:48.970 --> 03:50.760
How could I, huh?

03:51.980 --> 03:53.760
No one in the history
of Krypton has ever been able

03:53.940 --> 03:56.730
to withstand
a Somatic Reconditioning.

03:58.190 --> 04:00.230
How did you do this, Seg?

04:00.900 --> 04:04.860
Defying the odds
over and over again.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.110
I wouldn't
answer that truthfully,

04:07.280 --> 04:08.770
if I were you.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.620
Which, in a manner of speaking,
I suppose I am.

04:16.209 --> 04:20.040
However, you probably should
tell him something.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.079
Shut up.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.000
Off of your ass.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.920
Time for you to undo
what you did to Lyta.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.130
Better.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.140
As I'm sure
you've already heard,

04:35.310 --> 04:37.050
your ground support
are all dead.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.690
Now, if you'd like
to avoid the same fate,

04:38.860 --> 04:40.220
just do as I say.

04:40.690 --> 04:42.680
This war is over.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.480
- Hey, Lyta!
- Oh, no.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.770
Uh, you remember me?

04:47.780 --> 04:48.740
Adam.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.700
- Seg's buddy.
- Shut up.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.530
I--I do remember.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.490
You were the one
who wanted him to kill our son

04:55.670 --> 04:57.250
and let Brainiac take Kandor.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.830
That--that's taking it

05:03.010 --> 05:03.960
a little bit out of context.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.870
Do you want to live
or not, Adam?

05:07.090 --> 05:08.500
Shut up.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.920
That's the first smart thing
I've ever seen you do.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.520
God damn it.

05:16.690 --> 05:20.270
Now, as a sign of good faith,
you may return to your base...

05:23.190 --> 05:25.650
With a request from me
to Val-El and Jax-Ur.

05:26.530 --> 05:27.690
What kind of request?

05:27.860 --> 05:30.110
A meeting, face-to-face,
to discuss

05:30.280 --> 05:32.820
how to prevent further
bloodshed in this war.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.070
I expect a swift response.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.210
- Hey, give that back.
- Hey, come on, come on.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.910
- Give it back.
- Hold on.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.500
You two are staying with me.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.540
What about the gesture
of good faith

05:45.720 --> 05:47.250
that you were
just talking about?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.040
I'm putting my faith in Val.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.470
He'd never let you two die,
would he?

05:55.930 --> 05:56.800
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

05:56.980 --> 05:58.220
You know better than anyone

05:58.400 --> 05:59.760
the dangers of the Codex
falling into the wrong hands.

05:59.940 --> 06:00.970
Of course I do,
I just never thought

06:01.190 --> 06:01.970
the wrong hands would be yours.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.600
You--you weaponized it!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.360
We needed another option
in case the assault

06:05.490 --> 06:06.850
on the Base Station went south!

06:07.030 --> 06:09.110
Weaponizing the Codex
was our fail-safe!

06:09.280 --> 06:11.320
- You went behind my back!
- I was protecting you!

06:11.490 --> 06:13.570
I don't ever recall asking
for protection, nor needing it!

06:13.740 --> 06:16.410
But you do need it, Val!

06:17.250 --> 06:18.580
You are an El!

06:19.210 --> 06:21.160
The Rebels believe in you!

06:21.330 --> 06:23.540
You and your family's name
inspire them in ways

06:23.710 --> 06:25.290
that I never could!

06:25.630 --> 06:27.090
You give them hope.

06:29.550 --> 06:30.790
But that's just not enough
this time.

06:30.970 --> 06:33.460
We cannot become like him!

06:34.470 --> 06:35.510
There must be another way.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.840
No, you don't seem
to understand

06:37.020 --> 06:38.800
what is happening out there.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.430
Our entire ground support
are dead.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.180
Suffocated.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.690
The oxygenators we acquired

06:47.900 --> 06:50.070
from Zod's supply convoy
were tainted.

06:50.610 --> 06:51.900
Our strike team was ambushed

06:52.070 --> 06:54.490
before they could even reach
the Base Station.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.700
The other way failed, Val!

06:59.540 --> 07:01.700
Zod knew we were coming
the entire time.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.370
That can't be right.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.540
How is that possible?

07:06.710 --> 07:08.250
Take a damn guess.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.770
Don't shoot.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.520
My name is Nyssa-Vex.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.650
I have orders to report back
to General Zod.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.490
At once.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.910
Holy Rao, it really is you.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.620
Yeah, you mind telling
these guys that?

07:42.790 --> 07:44.250
Stand down, she's with us.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.130
- Thanks.
- Sorry about that.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.790
We've, um--we've had
a few Sagitari defect

07:49.970 --> 07:52.960
to the Rebels lately,
so everyone's a little on edge.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.210
But then, well,

07:55.390 --> 07:57.090
that's conscripts for you,
I guess.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.800
As disloyal
as they are ungrateful.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.810
Yeah, it's hard to know
who's on what side anymore.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.770
Mm.

08:04.770 --> 08:06.930
Come on, let's get you back
to Kandor, shall we?

08:16.990 --> 08:19.070
Why are they
looking at me like that?

08:19.240 --> 08:21.450
Well, they probably want
to thank you.

08:21.580 --> 08:22.570
For what?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.280
Those tainted oxygenators.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.740
If it weren't for them,
this base would be overrun

08:26.920 --> 08:28.200
by Rebel forces.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.170
You saved their lives
and mine.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.919
What do you mean,
"tainted oxygenators"?

08:34.630 --> 08:36.090
From the shipment
the Rebels stole.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.840
They all suffocated
before the battle even began.

08:42.059 --> 08:45.100
It was you who fed them
that information...

08:45.850 --> 08:46.560
right?

08:49.230 --> 08:50.440
Yeah.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.650
I'm responsible.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.150
For all of it.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.270
Congratulations, Nyssa.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.110
You've finally chosen
the right side.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.620
She requested a meeting

09:08.790 --> 09:10.330
with you and Val-El.

09:11.590 --> 09:13.880
She says she wants
to prevent further casualties.

09:14.130 --> 09:16.000
Is that why
she left you alive?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.040
And why she kept Kem
and Adam in her custody.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.890
Jax...

09:24.640 --> 09:26.550
Is it true
about the ground forces?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.180
Everyone?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.690
I'm so sorry.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.790
Stand by for orders.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.270
Shit.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.360
Thought I might have
another chance to sell you out.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.150
Sorry to disappoint.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.570
Just making sure
we can still pass as Sagitari.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.400
Congrats, you passed.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.500
Now, you owe me a drink.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.790
I'll buy you 20...
if you come with us.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.700
- Where to?
- Kandor.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.960
To assassinate General Zod and
to restore peace to Krypton.

10:45.310 --> 10:47.260
Rondor piss.

10:47.430 --> 10:50.020
The two of you versus
Zod's entire Sagitari?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.260
I was recently a commander
in that Sagitari.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.020
And I was their Primus.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.810
Too bad blaster fire
don't give a shit

10:55.980 --> 10:57.440
what any of us were.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.520
We know their patrol routes,
the frequency of their comms,

11:01.070 --> 11:03.560
and the security codes
to every sector in Fort Rozz.

11:03.950 --> 11:07.780
It won't be easy, but it's
the best chance we have.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.790
And we could use
all the help we can get.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.370
Even if you could do it,
nothing's gonna change.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.660
Some other tyrant
will take his place.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.500
No, Dru-Zod is different.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.420
He's worse than a tyrant.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.550
He's a conqueror,
and he will not stop

11:26.720 --> 11:28.810
until everyone kneels
before him.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.970
No matter where you are...

11:33.770 --> 11:37.140
You can't hide
from someone like General Zod.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.520
He will find you

11:39.690 --> 11:42.030
unless you find him first.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.700
Something you want
to tell me?

11:58.380 --> 11:59.460
No.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.670
You're making a mistake, Seg.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.430
By telling Lyta the truth
about what you did to her?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.880
Yes, I'm sure she's gonna
be pissed at me for that.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.510
She's on an important mission
to end this war peacefully.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.390
Any interference could cause
untold consequences.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.890
Do you really think so?

12:17.610 --> 12:19.390
Like maybe once she finds out
that you tortured her

12:19.610 --> 12:20.850
and manipulated her
into serving you,

12:21.030 --> 12:23.490
maybe she won't be so keen
on serving you anymore?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.270
I'm looking forward to Lyta
making her own decisions again.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.690
Like ordering the rest
of the Sagitari

12:29.870 --> 12:31.530
to turn against you.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.750
- Here.
- Careful.

12:42.510 --> 12:43.710
Please.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.000
Just let Lyta finish
what needs to be done.

12:46.470 --> 12:48.010
Then we can discuss this
as a family.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.590
We're not a family, Dru.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.470
We never were.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.980
Never going to be.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.820
I know I wasn't around
for your childhood,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.140
but that doesn't mean
you get to turn me and Lyta

13:05.320 --> 13:06.610
into the people
you wanted us to be.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.230
That was never
my intention, Seg.

13:08.450 --> 13:10.160
I don't care
about your intentions.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.610
I care about Lyta.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.660
So get on that comm
and contact her, now.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.210
I can't do that.

13:25.800 --> 13:26.960
I will not ask again.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.090
I mean, it's impossible.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.630
There is a solar flare
on Wegthor

13:36.190 --> 13:38.550
blocking all communication
until it's passed.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.890
Fine.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.810
Until then,
I have some questions

13:42.980 --> 13:44.600
about what's going on here.

13:45.530 --> 13:49.110
And you will answer them,
one way or another.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.780
We have to go.
This is Lyta.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.320
I'm sure she'll respond to
reason if we just talk to her.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.000
We tried that
months ago in Bokos

14:01.170 --> 14:02.960
before this was
even a rebellion.

14:03.590 --> 14:05.880
- Remember her response?
- But this time is different.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.760
- How?
- Seg.

14:08.930 --> 14:11.420
Adam told us
Seg went looking for Lyta.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.930
But if she's here, maybe they
never found one another.

14:15.390 --> 14:18.050
She might not even know
that Seg is alive.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.140
You think she'd choose Seg
over Zod?

14:21.310 --> 14:22.680
I know she would.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.480
And if Seg can get her
to see reason,

14:26.820 --> 14:28.810
she might even expose
Zod's deepest secret

14:28.990 --> 14:30.230
to the people.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.200
- Somatic Reconditioning.
- Exactly.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.490
Lyta must know about it.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.950
And the endless cells
filled with dissidents.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.040
This is what the rest
of Krypton needs to see

14:41.210 --> 14:43.500
to understand that Zod
is not their savior.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.040
He's their oppressor.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.550
Look, I know it's a risk,

14:49.090 --> 14:51.750
but I still believe
there's good in Lyta.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.390
We just need Seg
to help bring it out.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.020
All right, easy.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.560
Hey.

15:04.230 --> 15:05.600
You wanna know why
we're not out there

15:05.780 --> 15:06.560
with that lot, hmm?

15:06.730 --> 15:08.650
Execution.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.780
Oh, yes, I'm gonna
get whacked for treason,

15:11.990 --> 15:16.650
and you're gonna get whacked
for accessory to treason.

15:16.870 --> 15:19.200
Hey, I'm nobody's
accessory, okay?

15:20.330 --> 15:21.700
If I'm gonna get executed

15:21.920 --> 15:24.000
it's gonna be for something
I did, on my own, alone.

15:24.170 --> 15:25.250
- Oh.
- All alone.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.660
Seriously, that is your issue
with our current situation?

15:28.840 --> 15:29.710
Hey.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.880
- Isn't she with us?
- Who knows anymore?

15:34.550 --> 15:35.510
Hey, ow!

15:35.680 --> 15:37.260
What are you--hey!

15:38.640 --> 15:40.510
How dare you use me
like you did?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.180
You knew those oxygenators
were tainted

15:42.350 --> 15:43.340
when you sent me that intel.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.680
And you didn't?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.190
Did you really think

15:47.360 --> 15:48.770
we were gonna send you back
to the Rebels

15:48.940 --> 15:50.530
without making sure
you were on our side?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.240
We both did what was necessary,

15:54.660 --> 15:56.990
and now we have a chance
to end this war peacefully,

15:57.160 --> 15:59.070
and you have a chance
to get your son back.

15:59.250 --> 15:59.910
Primus?

16:00.910 --> 16:03.580
We've just received a message
from Val-El and Jax-Ur.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.200
They're willing to negotiate.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.330
See, Nyssa?

16:08.500 --> 16:10.370
Looks like you made
the right choice after all.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.350
Can I ask you something?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.200
It's a long ride.

16:38.370 --> 16:39.320
Go for it.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.280
When you left the Sagitari,

16:41.450 --> 16:43.700
did you ever consider joining
with the Rebels?

16:44.290 --> 16:46.450
For a split second, maybe.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.240
But in the end,
just couldn't stomach it.

16:52.550 --> 16:53.660
Jax.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.220
She wasn't the one
who killed my family.

17:02.310 --> 17:03.640
But she was in charge

17:03.810 --> 17:05.640
of the Black Zero members
who did.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.680
This war taught me something.

17:09.859 --> 17:12.470
I don't know what the right
or wrong side is anymore.

17:14.569 --> 17:17.280
I just know the only thing
I've ever truly believed in

17:17.410 --> 17:19.020
is you, Jayna.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.410
That's why I'm here.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.540
You're the only side I've got.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.050
How many?

17:42.970 --> 17:44.970
- How many what?
- People.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.720
How many people did you
Somatically Recondition?

17:46.890 --> 17:48.310
I know it's more
than just Lyta.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.970
As many as necessary
to achieve my vision.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.390
Well, it must be
kind of a shitty vision

17:52.570 --> 17:53.770
if you have to change
people's brains

17:53.940 --> 17:55.350
to get them to buy in.

17:55.530 --> 17:57.520
I admit, it's not easy
finding those who understand

17:57.700 --> 17:59.650
the scale of my ambition.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.530
But that was never
a problem with Lyta.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.650
You assume I brainwashed her
into following me.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.540
But the truth is...

18:07.330 --> 18:08.910
I barely changed a thing.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.280
She was overcome with guilt

18:12.460 --> 18:15.200
after shooting her mother
to save my life.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.460
A heroic decision

18:18.430 --> 18:21.090
that, nevertheless,
pained her terribly.

18:22.350 --> 18:25.010
And made worse by your absence.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.340
I took away that pain,
that's all.

18:27.730 --> 18:30.640
Not for myself, but for her.

18:33.820 --> 18:34.930
No.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.940
No, you changed
the best thing about Lyta.

18:42.370 --> 18:43.570
Her empathy.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.530
She felt guilty...

18:47.290 --> 18:49.620
about shooting her mother...

18:50.120 --> 18:53.740
because you're not supposed
to have to shoot your mother.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.450
You put her
in an impossible position.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.540
One that no one
should have to be in.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.800
And now she's up on Wegthor
fighting your war for you.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.960
But that's all going to change.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.130
Once the truth comes out,

19:07.310 --> 19:11.600
she'll be down here
fighting your war against you

19:11.770 --> 19:14.260
alongside the rest of Krypton.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.690
Is that what you think?

19:20.070 --> 19:23.480
Do you really believe
that you showing Lyta the truth

19:23.660 --> 19:25.740
will suddenly wake her up

19:25.910 --> 19:27.070
and turn her against me?

19:29.660 --> 19:33.250
This is who she is now.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.460
Every choice she made
was her own.

19:36.630 --> 19:38.710
Lyta chose to go up to Wegthor,

19:39.300 --> 19:41.080
just like she chose me
over her mother.

19:41.260 --> 19:44.550
And if it comes
down to it, Seg...

19:47.180 --> 19:49.390
She'll choose me over you.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.810
Thank you for coming.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.070
- How's the eye?
- Never better.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.820
Just so you know,
there are snipers positioned

20:01.990 --> 20:04.450
ready to end this conversation
in an instant

20:04.990 --> 20:06.530
should your temper
get the better of you.

20:07.410 --> 20:08.530
Where are Adam and Kem?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.570
They're safe,
and they'll continue to be

20:10.750 --> 20:12.280
as long as you agree
to our terms.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.490
- Which are?
- Complete surrender.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.750
Do that now
and you have General Zod's word

20:16.920 --> 20:18.130
that no one else
will be killed.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.840
That's it?

20:23.220 --> 20:24.420
That's your offer?

20:24.590 --> 20:26.080
Well, it's better than death.

20:27.470 --> 20:31.140
If we have to, we will finish
your rebellion with force,

20:31.310 --> 20:33.770
resulting in casualties
on both sides.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.560
Considerably more on yours,
I'm afraid.

20:36.770 --> 20:39.510
And what of our people?
What happens to them?

20:39.690 --> 20:41.560
They'll be assigned
to various Guilds.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.980
You two will join
the Science Guild, of course,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.360
where your work will be valued.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.200
Dru isn't the villain
you portray him to be.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.620
He wants you on his side.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.580
He wants every Kryptonian
on his side.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.160
Well, you can tell
Dru-Zod to--

20:58.250 --> 20:59.410
No.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.040
Lyta, listen to me.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.380
It doesn't have
to be like this.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.590
Seg is alive.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.260
He's back
to help end this war.

21:12.430 --> 21:14.020
To show you
who the real enemy is.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.220
He has already.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.010
Seg found me
before I came up here.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.810
He's with Dru now,
awaiting my return.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.180
Now, you know my terms.

21:24.610 --> 21:27.400
Please, don't choose
the wrong side again.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.330
What do you think?

21:35.410 --> 21:37.410
I think Zod knows
your weakness.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.790
Which is?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.540
You won't let anyone
you care about die.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.830
If that's a weakness,
we all have it.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.710
Exactly.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.210
I need a decision.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.810
- Jax, we need to decide.
- Right now.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.720
Please, say something.

22:00.770 --> 22:01.680
No deal.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.700
It's time.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.940
Contact Lyta.

22:21.210 --> 22:22.370
Now.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.590
<i>General Zod.</i>

22:30.180 --> 22:31.920
<i>I'm sure you
and the people of Krypton</i>

22:32.100 --> 22:34.680
<i>are eager to hear our response
to your offer.</i>

22:34.850 --> 22:37.640
<i>But there's something
I'd like to show you first.</i>

22:52.200 --> 22:53.820
<i>General Zod, you have made</i>

22:53.990 --> 22:56.230
<i>the people of Krypton
kneel before you.</i>

22:56.410 --> 22:59.120
<i>You have reconditioned
their minds, conscripted them,</i>

22:59.290 --> 23:01.910
<i>sacrificed them, all in
the name of your vision.</i>

23:02.670 --> 23:04.710
<i>But what have you sacrificed?</i>

23:05.710 --> 23:06.870
<i>Nothing.</i>

23:08.260 --> 23:09.870
<i>Until now.</i>

23:10.300 --> 23:12.090
<i>Let me be precise.</i>

23:12.720 --> 23:14.840
<i>General Zod,
you have one hour</i>

23:15.010 --> 23:17.680
<i>to being withdrawing
your Sagitari from Wegthor.</i>

23:18.430 --> 23:20.470
<i>If you refuse this demand,</i>

23:21.230 --> 23:23.440
<i>Lyta dies without hesitation.</i>

23:24.650 --> 23:26.860
<i>So what's more important
to you?</i>

23:27.320 --> 23:29.900
<i>Your mother or your war?</i>

23:30.070 --> 23:31.730
<i>You can't have both.</i>

23:33.370 --> 23:34.400
<i>One hour.</i>

23:38.580 --> 23:40.910
What are you going to do?

23:41.500 --> 23:42.580
I will handle it.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.580
That had better mean
keeping her alive.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.620
I would never let anything
happen to Lyta.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.090
And neither would Val.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.370
That wasn't Val
on the broadcast, was it?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.140
Take the Primus down.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.010
Lock her up.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.430
How did you do that
with your eye up there?

24:04.610 --> 24:07.600
Kinetic energy buildup from
an electromagnetic generator

24:07.730 --> 24:09.470
attached to what's left
of my retina.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.690
You see, whatever is taken away
from me, I rebuild...

24:14.410 --> 24:15.570
stronger than ever.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.860
Good for you.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.110
Do make yourself comfortable,
Primus.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.200
You're not going anywhere.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.120
Do we still have access
to Kandor's broadcast system?

24:25.460 --> 24:26.450
For now.

24:26.670 --> 24:29.000
Lyta's authentication codes
are still blocking any attempts

24:29.210 --> 24:30.080
at shutting us down.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.170
Good.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.420
If Zod stays silent,
I might have to show the people

24:33.590 --> 24:34.630
of Kandor just what happens--

24:34.800 --> 24:36.420
You will do no such thing!

24:36.600 --> 24:38.430
How could you make
such a rash decision out there?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.300
You said you wanted
to turn the people against Zod.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.310
- This is how.
- By threatening his mother?

24:42.480 --> 24:45.310
She is the only person
Zod truly cares about.

24:45.900 --> 24:49.140
If Zod risks losing this war
just to save his mother,

24:49.320 --> 24:51.680
it goes against everything
the Sagitari are taught.

24:51.860 --> 24:54.520
Loyalty to Krypton
above all else.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.820
But if Zod lets Lyta die...

24:58.780 --> 25:00.120
the people of Kandor
will see him

25:00.290 --> 25:01.780
just as they did Daron.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.540
Just another tyrant
desperate to stay in power.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.960
Either way, he loses
the Sagitari or the people.

25:09.170 --> 25:13.130
Even if I were to agree
with your assessment,

25:13.300 --> 25:16.840
we will still have to be
willing to kill Lyta.

25:28.690 --> 25:31.180
You're becoming more like him
every day, Sela-Sonn.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.810
One of us has to, Val.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.940
If we are to win this war,

25:36.860 --> 25:38.530
if we're to survive.

25:39.410 --> 25:40.820
I'm sorry...

25:42.120 --> 25:43.990
but if you go through
with this...

25:45.210 --> 25:46.790
you do it alone.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.570
I was afraid you'd say that.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.210
What is this?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.090
What are you doing?

25:56.760 --> 25:58.470
Whatever it takes.

26:06.810 --> 26:08.520
All this in six months.

26:08.690 --> 26:09.770
Imagine what
we could have done

26:09.940 --> 26:11.650
if we conscripted
the entire city.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.310
Come on!

26:13.900 --> 26:14.810
We got company.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.070
All Sagitari
to transport now!

26:29.080 --> 26:30.240
Where are you two going?

26:30.500 --> 26:31.620
Didn't you get the new orders?

26:32.710 --> 26:33.950
We've been on
special assignment

26:34.130 --> 26:35.420
in the Outlands.

26:35.590 --> 26:36.700
For how long?

26:37.130 --> 26:38.710
Long enough to find
the location

26:38.880 --> 26:40.220
of the traitor Dev-Em.

26:41.550 --> 26:44.090
Yes, and the even worse
traitor, Jayna-Zod.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.590
The location's here
on our nav data.

26:48.350 --> 26:51.220
General Zod needs
to see this immediately.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.100
Fine, take it up to him.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.060
But then report back
to your squad leaders.

26:55.230 --> 26:57.150
The General wants all available
Sagitari standing by

26:57.320 --> 26:58.810
for immediate deployment
to Wegthor

26:58.990 --> 27:01.100
in case the situation
gets even worse up there.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.950
What is the situation
up there?

27:06.370 --> 27:07.110
Move.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.910
Don't say a word.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.450
Lyta's life depends on it.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.460
<i>Have you made up
your mind, General?</i>

27:24.300 --> 27:26.590
- I have.
- And?

27:33.480 --> 27:35.810
I will begin withdrawing
from Wegthor at once.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.140
<i>I will contact you again</i>

27:40.320 --> 27:42.150
<i>when all our forces
have vacated the moon.</i>

27:42.490 --> 27:44.400
I better see
immediate progress.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.660
For your mother's sake.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.910
Mobilize all units
for immediate evacuation,

27:58.090 --> 28:00.500
and make sure the Rebels
can see it on their heat maps.

28:00.670 --> 28:01.910
<i>We're on it, General.</i>

28:05.300 --> 28:08.050
You still doubt me
even though I told you

28:08.220 --> 28:10.180
I would never
let anything happen to Lyta.

28:10.930 --> 28:12.720
Aside from Lyta,
I've never known a Zod

28:12.900 --> 28:14.480
to ask for mercy or give it,

28:14.610 --> 28:18.390
so until she's safely back here
I will reserve my judgment.

28:19.150 --> 28:20.940
That's unfortunate.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.820
I never resented growing up
without a father, Seg.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.660
I resented a world cruel enough

28:33.830 --> 28:35.910
to break someone as strong
as my mother.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.620
And you may not
believe this, but...

28:41.050 --> 28:42.660
all I wanted from you

28:43.260 --> 28:44.500
was to make you proud.

28:47.970 --> 28:49.210
You're right.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.470
I don't believe you.

28:53.850 --> 28:56.260
But work this negotiation right

28:56.400 --> 28:58.680
and bring Lyta home safely,

28:58.860 --> 29:00.140
and we can talk.

29:00.570 --> 29:01.850
We'll talk about this war.

29:02.030 --> 29:03.890
We'll talk about your vision...

29:04.530 --> 29:06.150
for Krypton.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.980
You have the wrong idea, Seg.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.910
I said I had wanted
to make you proud.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.700
That was in the past.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.290
I no longer need that.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.170
I no longer need anything...

29:24.420 --> 29:25.590
from you.

29:39.650 --> 29:41.480
Keep moving.
You answer to Zod.

29:41.650 --> 29:42.690
Let's go.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.040
Yo, Space Force.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.740
Can you stop messing with that?

29:58.920 --> 30:00.910
- It's not a toy.
- It looks like a toy.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.290
Well, it's not.

30:02.460 --> 30:06.130
Whatever it is, if I get
to kill you two, I'm keeping it.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.670
I'm sorry, did--did I catch
an "if" in there?

30:08.800 --> 30:10.880
General Zod gave orders
to kill you both

30:11.100 --> 30:14.590
if the retreat fails and
the Rebels kill the hostage.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.680
- Wait, what hostage?
- What does this thing do?

30:16.850 --> 30:17.590
No, don't touch that!

30:23.690 --> 30:25.060
Where the hell
did you come from?

30:25.780 --> 30:27.860
What do you--who cares?

30:28.990 --> 30:31.400
Hurry, you need to get back
to the Rebels.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.070
There's a safe passage
because of the retreat.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.740
- What, you're not gonna come?
- I can't.

30:35.910 --> 30:38.280
I'm a traitor
on both sides now.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.210
Well, where you
gonna go, then?

30:40.380 --> 30:41.740
To get my son.

30:42.170 --> 30:42.910
Kem?

30:48.720 --> 30:51.250
<i>I trust we are looking
at the same images?</i>

30:51.680 --> 30:54.510
<i>My Sagitari boarding the
space elevator to Krypton?</i>

30:54.680 --> 30:56.010
I see a retreat.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.770
Once the last of the Sagitari
are off Wegthor,

30:59.940 --> 31:02.390
we'll make arrangements to get
your mother back to Kandor.

31:03.650 --> 31:05.940
<i>What guarantees do I have
that you won't just kill her?</i>

31:06.490 --> 31:07.940
You have Val's.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.990
His word is unblemished.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.650
<i>Not that I don't trust
the word of a man</i>

31:11.820 --> 31:13.860
<i>I've yet to see or hear from,</i>

31:14.080 --> 31:17.660
<i>but just in case, I'd like
to speak to my mother.</i>

31:20.250 --> 31:22.660
<i>It will be brief, I promise.</i>

31:22.880 --> 31:24.660
If I hear anything that
sounds like coded language,

31:24.800 --> 31:25.960
she dies.

31:26.170 --> 31:27.380
Do you understand?

31:27.550 --> 31:28.880
<i>Undoubtedly.</i>

31:30.430 --> 31:31.710
Stand by.

31:37.850 --> 31:40.720
I have orders to deliver
sensitive intel to General Zod.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.680
I'll take it to him.

31:42.850 --> 31:44.470
Sorry, has to be me.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.700
Oh, shit.

32:00.870 --> 32:03.330
- Which way, Kem?
- Uh...

32:05.920 --> 32:07.330
Wait, hang on.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.590
Hang on,
I'm getting a bio reading.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.840
Hey, that's great, buddy,
Let's keep going.

32:16.220 --> 32:18.050
No, you don't understand.

32:18.180 --> 32:20.470
When I was a Sagitari,
we blew this tunnel

32:20.600 --> 32:22.930
and exposed a huge deposit
of Stellarium

32:23.100 --> 32:24.720
which was not on any
of our maps.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.480
So?
Who bloody cares?

32:27.820 --> 32:29.810
Everyone in that explosion
was killed,

32:29.990 --> 32:33.320
but I'm still picking up lots
of warm bodies behind there.

32:33.490 --> 32:35.400
- Lots of them.
- Stranded Rebels?

32:36.280 --> 32:37.610
Switch to thermal.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.950
What is it?

32:48.130 --> 32:50.710
We need to get back
to Val, now.

32:55.430 --> 32:56.540
Lyta.

32:57.050 --> 32:57.960
Are you all right?

32:59.890 --> 33:01.760
This will be over soon,
I promise.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.630
We're in the process
of getting you home safely.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.850
<i>No, please don't.</i>

33:07.020 --> 33:09.510
<i>I knew the risks
coming up here.</i>

33:10.110 --> 33:10.890
<i>It was my choice.</i>

33:11.070 --> 33:12.850
And it is my choice
to save you.

33:13.070 --> 33:15.560
<i>I am willing to die
for the cause.</i>

33:16.490 --> 33:18.780
I am not willing
to let you die.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.500
You don't actually...

33:29.710 --> 33:31.540
believe him, do you?

33:40.220 --> 33:43.970
Zod is quite
a formidable liar.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.130
He is able to convince himself
of almost anything

33:47.310 --> 33:49.900
when the occasion
necessitates it.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.100
What's happening?

33:52.480 --> 33:53.720
Are you back?

33:54.440 --> 33:56.530
Are you back inside my mind?

33:56.990 --> 33:58.600
I never left.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.110
However, your attempts
to destroy me on Colu

34:02.290 --> 34:04.490
were not without consequence.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.820
There is very little of me

34:07.000 --> 34:09.790
that remains within you,
Seg-El.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.290
An infinitesimal fragment.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.620
But enough to save you.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.670
Save me from what?

34:20.260 --> 34:22.130
Your own self-destruction.

34:23.139 --> 34:25.100
I was able
to neutralize the attempts

34:25.270 --> 34:26.679
at your Somatic Reconditioning,

34:26.850 --> 34:29.810
but in this diminished state,

34:29.980 --> 34:32.690
I must rely on you more
than I'd prefer.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.560
And if we are to survive
this particular situation,

34:35.739 --> 34:37.770
you must stop allowing
emotional impulses

34:37.949 --> 34:41.860
to trample upon the dictates
of rational thought.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.770
What do you mean?

34:43.949 --> 34:48.370
Why was Zod able
to disarm you earlier?

34:51.210 --> 34:53.250
Because I was distracted.

34:54.340 --> 34:55.199
In case you hadn't noticed,

34:55.380 --> 34:57.120
the woman I love
is being held hostage.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.630
Zod loves her, too.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.170
But in that fraction
of a second, you were thinking

35:00.340 --> 35:03.510
about her, and he was thinking
about his own survival.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.420
Well, what can I say?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.010
He's a cosmic-sized asshole.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.970
Zod is determined

35:10.100 --> 35:11.810
to win this war,

35:11.980 --> 35:14.970
even if he has
to sacrifice Lyta to do so.

35:16.230 --> 35:18.570
If you do nothing,

35:19.110 --> 35:20.980
he will succeed.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.530
What exactly
do you want me to do?

35:36.630 --> 35:39.420
The answer is...

35:39.590 --> 35:41.670
entirely self-evident.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.880
Warn her.

35:44.970 --> 35:48.810
Tell her about
the Somatic Reconditioning,

35:49.770 --> 35:52.930
and then kill him.

35:53.270 --> 35:55.640
Before he kills you.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.310
<i>Please, don't
compromise your vision</i>

36:00.490 --> 36:01.940
<i>for my decision.</i>

36:02.110 --> 36:04.320
There is nothing
I would put above you, Lyta.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.740
- Nothing.
- Lyta!

36:06.910 --> 36:07.900
Don't listen to him, Lyta!

36:08.080 --> 36:09.030
He Somatic--

36:12.500 --> 36:14.790
- What was that?
- I--I don't know, I swear.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.420
Are you trying
to get her killed?

36:43.280 --> 36:45.610
You may never see
my vision, Seg.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.110
I won't let you threaten it.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.410
Relax.

36:58.420 --> 36:59.630
Zod!

37:01.170 --> 37:02.290
No!

37:08.850 --> 37:10.010
Let him go!

37:19.650 --> 37:20.890
You're alive.

37:21.940 --> 37:22.980
Of course you are.

37:23.150 --> 37:24.610
Drop the weapon.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.690
- Let him go!
- I have no shot.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.450
Drop the weapon, Dru!

37:30.620 --> 37:32.280
I can't do that, Jayna.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.620
If you're going to kill me,
you're going to kill the love

37:34.790 --> 37:37.580
- of your daughter's life.
- Jayna, do it!

37:37.750 --> 37:39.960
Kill him!
Save Lyta!

37:40.130 --> 37:41.790
End the war!
Do it!

37:41.960 --> 37:44.380
She can't.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.540
No, but I can.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.130
Guards, guards!
Intruders!

37:53.350 --> 37:55.590
He's gone.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.810
Oh, shit.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.760
Every Sagitari in Kandor
would have heard that.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.980
We need to move.
Let's go.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.950
Why can't we reconnect?
Does anyone have anything?

38:15.120 --> 38:16.830
I have reports
on Zod's forces!

38:17.290 --> 38:20.200
Reconnaissance reports that
the Sagitari have all boarded

38:20.380 --> 38:21.870
the space elevator on Wegthor.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.880
Then why are all
of Zod's communications down?

38:24.050 --> 38:25.580
I--I don't know.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.460
She goes nowhere
until we find out.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.500
Put her back in her cell.

38:42.110 --> 38:45.060
<i>Seg-El, descend the stairs.</i>

38:49.030 --> 38:51.490
<i>Behind you, fire now.</i>

38:52.330 --> 38:54.820
<i>One Sagitari on your left.</i>

38:56.660 --> 38:57.900
<i>Again.</i>

39:00.460 --> 39:03.170
- How did you know--
- <i>Ahead in 1.2 seconds.</i>

39:06.460 --> 39:08.080
<i>Behind you, southeast corner.</i>

39:08.260 --> 39:09.250
What are you...

39:10.390 --> 39:11.340
<i>Steady.</i>

39:12.850 --> 39:13.630
<i>Now.</i>

39:18.520 --> 39:19.680
When'd you get good at this?

39:19.850 --> 39:20.590
Uh...

39:22.560 --> 39:23.800
The Phantom Zone.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.400
We should probably
keep moving.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.160
How did you two escape?

39:47.340 --> 39:48.950
Nyssa freed us.

39:49.130 --> 39:50.290
You saw Nyssa?
Well, where is she?

39:50.470 --> 39:51.830
Forget about Nyssa.

39:52.010 --> 39:54.130
There's something
that you need to know.

39:54.430 --> 39:55.760
Something that you all need
to know.

39:55.930 --> 39:56.840
Tell me.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.130
Well, what is it?

39:59.850 --> 40:01.720
- Adam?
- Oh, for God's sake.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.770
Better take a look
for yourself, sir--ma'am.

40:15.740 --> 40:16.860
Where are we going?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.400
What's left of the old
Rankless District.

40:18.580 --> 40:19.570
Adam says there's
an underground

40:19.750 --> 40:20.530
Rebel network there.

40:20.710 --> 40:21.910
We need to find someone
and contact Jax

40:22.080 --> 40:23.290
before it's too late.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.580
<i>People of Kandor.</i>

40:27.210 --> 40:30.080
<i>I regret to inform you
that your leader is a liar.</i>

40:30.550 --> 40:31.960
<i>A fake.</i>

40:32.630 --> 40:34.300
<i>And even worse...</i>

40:34.720 --> 40:37.760
<i>a man willing to condemn
his own mother to death</i>

40:37.970 --> 40:39.930
<i>for the sake of his own pride.</i>

40:40.140 --> 40:42.470
<i>Zod claimed he was retreating.</i>

40:43.230 --> 40:45.970
But instead, he amassed
his forces underground.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.560
Hidden inside a mine
waiting to ambush us

40:48.730 --> 40:50.690
the moment we returned
Lyta-Zod.

40:52.030 --> 40:53.940
<i>To complete his deception,</i>

40:54.110 --> 40:55.980
<i>he sent captured
Rebel prisoners</i>

40:56.120 --> 40:59.450
<i>to board the elevator in place
of his own Sagitari.</i>

40:59.620 --> 41:02.280
<i>Decoys meant to distract us</i>

41:02.460 --> 41:04.200
<i>from his blatant betrayal.</i>

41:06.380 --> 41:07.790
<i>General Zod,</i>

41:08.590 --> 41:10.330
<i>you have betrayed us.</i>

41:10.710 --> 41:11.370
No.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.580
<i>You have betrayed
your people,</i>

41:14.090 --> 41:16.420
<i>and you have betrayed
your own mother.</i>

41:17.890 --> 41:19.050
<i>And for that...</i>

41:21.310 --> 41:24.470
<i>you must be punished.</i>

41:24.640 --> 41:25.760
Jax, don't do it!

41:26.190 --> 41:28.720
Don't become like him!
Please, Jax!

41:31.480 --> 41:32.470
<i>Please!</i>

41:33.950 --> 41:35.610
<i>Please, don't do it!</i>
