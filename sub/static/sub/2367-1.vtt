WEBVTT

00:14.557 --> 00:16.016
[distant siren wailing]

00:27.319 --> 00:28.821
Move... please.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.447
Matty.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.950
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.785
[man] Don't move.
Help is coming, kid.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.454
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.789
-Matty! Matty!
-Dad.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.666
Matty! Matty!
Don't, don't move, okay?

00:40.749 --> 00:42.375
No, no, no! Just--
Don't move.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.877
Somebody get us some help!

00:43.961 --> 00:45.588
-Dad, what happened?
-Matty, it's gonna be all right.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.631
-Just don't move. Don't move, okay?
-What happened?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.011
[man] Take it easy.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.601
Your boy...
He pushed me out of the way.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.311
He saved my life.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.732
[coughing]
Oh, Dad! Oh, it burns!

01:11.029 --> 01:12.197
Oh, Jesus!

01:13.949 --> 01:15.743
Close your eyes, Matty.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.244
-Dad!
-Close your eyes.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.829
-Dad! Dad!
-Close your eyes.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.413
Dad. Dad. Dad.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.792
[stuttering]
I can't see.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.630
I can't see.
I can't see!

01:27.713 --> 01:29.297
I can't see!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.884
[sirens approaching]

01:31.967 --> 01:34.136
I can't see!

01:34.219 --> 01:36.179
I can't see!

01:37.973 --> 01:40.558
[Matt]
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:40.643 --> 01:42.060
It's been, uh...

01:43.812 --> 01:46.064
It's been too long
since my last confession.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.443
My dad, he used to come to this church
back when I was a kid.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.781
He was a fighter.
Old school. Boxer.

01:54.865 --> 01:59.286
Lost more than he won.
Had a 24-31 record before he, uh...

02:04.958 --> 02:07.502
But he could take a punch.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.005
-Jesus, he could take a punch.
-Language.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.424
Sorry, Father.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.846
Yeah, guys he went up against
used to say it was like hitting oak.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.933
And nights when he was outmatched,

02:21.016 --> 02:23.977
my dad's strategy was to let 'em hit him
till they broke their hands.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.228
[chuckles]

02:27.230 --> 02:30.150
He never got knocked out, my dad.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.446
Knocked down, sure.
But he, uh, always got back up.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.325
He was always on his feet when he lost.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.204
Every now and then, though, uh...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.336
Every now and then, he'd get hit and...

02:52.380 --> 02:54.549
something inside of him would snap.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.471
My grandmother, she was the real Catholic.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.390
Fear of God ran deep.
You'd have liked her.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.604
She used to say,
"Be careful of the Murdock boys.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.190
They got the devil in 'em."
[chuckles]

03:13.276 --> 03:15.362
And you'd see it sometimes...

03:17.239 --> 03:18.656
in the ring.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.121
His eyes would go dead...

03:26.373 --> 03:29.167
and he'd start walking forward
real slow...

03:31.795 --> 03:34.464
hands at his sides,
like he wasn't afraid of anything.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.133
[sighs]

03:37.718 --> 03:42.180
And the other guy, he'd see that look,
and he'd try to get away from him.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.267
Nah.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.312
My dad, he'd catch him
and... trap him in the corner.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.863
Let the devil out.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.241
Yeah.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.537
Now, I didn't understand it, you know?

04:06.579 --> 04:10.167
What he was feeling deep inside,
I didn't understand it.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.885
Not back then.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.722
But you understand it now?

04:26.141 --> 04:29.937
Perhaps this would be easier
if you tell me what you've done.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.112
I'm not seeking penance
for what I've done, Father.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.324
I'm asking forgiveness...

04:43.450 --> 04:45.285
for what I'm about to do.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.913
That's not how this works.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.210
What exactly are you going to do?

04:54.878 --> 04:55.963
[girl] Help!

04:56.046 --> 04:57.547
Help! Help me!

04:58.631 --> 05:00.550
Help! Help me!

05:00.633 --> 05:01.885
[girls screaming]

05:04.137 --> 05:05.889
Hey! Hey!

05:05.973 --> 05:07.432
Man, shut up.

05:07.515 --> 05:11.061
I'm getting $1,000 a head for y'all.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.646
So, you be quiet...

05:14.564 --> 05:17.067
I let you have a bucket.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.568
You don't...

05:19.277 --> 05:20.653
-[crackling]
-[screams]

05:24.908 --> 05:26.201
[girls screaming]

05:26.284 --> 05:28.203
-[man speaking Russian]
-No!

05:29.246 --> 05:31.248
[girl sobbing] No. Please, no.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.000
Scream all you want.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.667
Come on, let me hear you scream.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.961
Scream loud.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.881
[girl] It's okay.
[Turk] Nobody gives a shit down here.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.382
[laughing]

05:40.465 --> 05:41.758
[screaming]

05:44.511 --> 05:45.803
[grunts]

05:48.681 --> 05:50.058
[man yelling]

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734

06:24.634 --> 06:25.635
-[bone cracking]
-[man screams]

06:25.718 --> 06:27.012
[clicking]

06:39.983 --> 06:41.568
[footsteps on freight container]

07:06.884 --> 07:08.095
[grunts]

07:09.221 --> 07:10.638
-[water splashing]
-[girls gasping]

07:10.722 --> 07:14.642
Head towards 48th. Stay in the lights.
Flag down the first officer you see.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.270
-Now!
-[girls screaming]

07:26.404 --> 07:27.697
[grunting]

07:37.915 --> 07:39.917
[theme music playing]

08:44.566 --> 08:48.070
[automated female voice]
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.779
-Yeah, yeah.
-Foggy.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.281
[beeps]

08:51.364 --> 08:52.407
Hello.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.492
[Foggy] Good morning, sunshine!

08:54.576 --> 08:57.037
-What time is it?
-Half past get the hell up.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.580
Let's go. We gotta meet

08:58.663 --> 09:00.748
-the real estate agent in 45.
-[groans]

09:00.832 --> 09:03.043
What was that? Was that a moan?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.877
-Do you have somebody in bed with you?
-[groans]

09:04.961 --> 09:07.755
The paralegal?
Is it the para over at--

09:07.839 --> 09:09.382
Never mind, I don't wanna hear about it.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.052
No, I do wanna hear about it!
What was she like?

09:13.595 --> 09:14.846
[exhales sharply]
Violent.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.640
I gotta get the blind thing going.
It's so unfair.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.810
Oh, hey! Real estate agent, not your type.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.980
Very homely. Might be genetic.
No need to be charming.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.941
And she kinda told me she thinks
blind people are "God's mistake."

09:28.151 --> 09:29.777
That's a horrible thing to say, Foggy.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.029
I know! In this day and age?

09:32.114 --> 09:34.324
All right, shake it.
I gotta go bribe a cop.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.492
Ah, Foggy.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.660
Kidding, NSA, if you're listening.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.872
But seriously, yeah,
I gotta go bribe a cop.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.260
Officer of the law.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.513
Defense attorney.
We're supposed to be enemies.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.849
First off, we've been enemies
since we were four, Brett,

09:59.932 --> 10:02.059
so let's not blame it on career choices.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.772
Secondly, I'm not
a particularly good defense attorney,

10:05.855 --> 10:08.150
so helping me is like helping yourself.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.068
And finally, these are for Bess.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.492
Please stop giving my mom cigars, Foggy.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.494
What? She'll outlive us all.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.746
Look, I'm not asking you
to do anything immoral.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.039
Just give me a heads up

10:23.123 --> 10:25.708
if something, you know,
interesting walks through the door.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.629
You're right.
It ain't the careers.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.215
Thanks, buddy!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.092
[sighs deeply]

10:37.387 --> 10:41.015
You've got a reception area,
a conference room and two offices.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.143
Corner suite has a view of the Hudson.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.977
You can flip a coin
with your partner for it.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.396
Uh, he can have the view.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.650
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to--

10:50.733 --> 10:51.901
-Of course not.
-[chuckles]

10:53.486 --> 10:56.531
Susan Harris.
Midtown Property Solutions.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.115
Matt Murdock.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.368
[chuckles]

11:01.161 --> 11:03.496
She just curtsied.
It was adorable.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.416
Well, it's nice to know
chivalry isn't dead.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.294
Susan, would you mind
walking me around the space?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.838
Of course.
My pleasure.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.131
As I was telling your associate,

11:14.216 --> 11:16.801
this office was barely touched
by the incident,

11:16.884 --> 11:18.845
which is why it's on the market already.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.638
The neighbors weren't so lucky.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.808
"The incident"?
Is that what we're calling it now?

11:23.891 --> 11:25.810
Well, it sounds so much better than

11:25.893 --> 11:27.645
"death and destruction
raining from the sky,

11:27.729 --> 11:29.522
nearly wiping Hell's Kitchen off the map."

11:29.606 --> 11:30.898
Shorter, too.

11:30.982 --> 11:35.111
Owner figuring in the delightful view
of cranes and scaffolding?

11:35.194 --> 11:37.239
Feels like we're getting
pre-incident prices.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.574
They're a quarter of what they used to be.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.534
Hell's Kitchen's on the rebound,
Mr. Nelson,

11:41.618 --> 11:42.869
and in 18 months,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.288
you won't be able to
rent a broom closet at this price point.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.623
We'll take it.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.915
[chuckling]

11:47.999 --> 11:50.126
We will talk about it.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.296
Because we're not sure
we can afford even this palace,

11:53.380 --> 11:56.299
unless we make some changes
to our current clientele policies.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.092
My partner and I
are having some disagreements

11:58.175 --> 11:59.927
over the direction of Nelson and Murdock.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.679
I believe we're here
to defend the innocent.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.224
And I believe the innocent includes
everyone not yet convicted of a crime.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.101
You know, as the law states.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.145
He tends to use fancy terminology.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.732
And my partner fails to recognize
that, as defense attorneys,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.567
we're never gonna be able
to keep the lights on,

12:14.651 --> 12:18.613
waiting on a horde of innocent souls
to stumble into our loving arms.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.366
At this point, I'd settle for just one.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.204
[shuddering breath]

12:35.171 --> 12:36.381
Drop the knife!

12:36.464 --> 12:38.383
-No, no, I didn't--
-Drop it!

12:38.466 --> 12:40.635
I didn't do this! I didn't--
I didn't do this!

12:40.718 --> 12:42.387
-Get on the ground!
-I didn't do this!

12:42.470 --> 12:43.930
-Now!
-Oh, God!

12:44.013 --> 12:45.348
[sobbing] Oh, God!

12:46.641 --> 12:47.892
[sobbing]
No, I didn't do this.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.937
Oh, God! I didn't do this!

12:51.020 --> 12:52.063
Oh, no!

12:53.898 --> 12:55.733
I didn't do this!

13:03.825 --> 13:05.034
[cell phone ringing]

13:07.161 --> 13:08.245
[chuckles]

13:08.330 --> 13:10.081
-Hey, buddy.
-[Brett] Homicide.

13:10.164 --> 13:14.377
Female suspect found at the scene.
Definitely qualifies as interesting.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.421
She's been charged yet?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.506
Assistant DA hasn't made the call yet.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.007
Do you have a name on the suspect?

13:20.091 --> 13:22.259
Yeah. Page.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.053
-Karen Page.
-[door opening]

13:28.600 --> 13:31.936
Okay, can we please take the handcuffs off
the 110-pound woman?

13:32.019 --> 13:35.147
Miss Page, can you tell me
who these men are?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.483
We're her lawyers.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.150
Uncuff our client
and give us the room, please.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.452
[Karen sighs]

13:48.035 --> 13:49.829
Thank you, Detective.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.005
[door lock buzzes]

13:59.088 --> 14:02.925
Miss Page, my name is Matt Murdock.
This is my associate, Foggy Nelson.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.427
Do you mind if we sit down?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.474
She gave a vague shrug.
I say we go with it.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.562
We understand you're in some trouble.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.606
We, uh, may be able to help.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.941
[Foggy] Can you tell us what happened?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.489
Why don't we start
with what we know, then?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.282
[sighs]

14:26.366 --> 14:29.869
You were found in your apartment
with one Daniel Fisher.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.329
Who appears to be
the victim of a homicide,

14:32.414 --> 14:34.206
and currently,
you're the only suspect, Miss Page.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.750
Who the hell are you guys?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.627
I'm Matt.
He's Foggy.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.004
Who sent you?

14:40.087 --> 14:41.798
No one sent us.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.427
So, what?
You're just a couple of Good Samaritans?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.555
Today's just my lucky day?

14:48.638 --> 14:51.974
I bribed the desk sergeant
with a box of cigars for his mom.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.810
[Matt] Our practice is relatively young,
Miss Page,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.187
and we are aggressively pursuing
new clientele.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.647
You gotta stop giving Bess cigars.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.357
She likes to smoke, Matt.
It's a free country.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.570
So how long have you been practicing law?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.363
What time is it?

15:06.448 --> 15:08.491
It's 12:22 a.m.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.867
About seven hours.

15:09.951 --> 15:10.993
[scoffs]

15:11.077 --> 15:12.454
Well, if you go from
when we passed the bar--

15:12.537 --> 15:13.788
I was going from
when we got our own desks.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.082
Oh, then, yeah.
Seven hours.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.251
You've never done this before?

15:19.335 --> 15:23.172
If you were to hire us, then, yes,
you would be our first client.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.632
Technically. Yeah.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.595
Well, I don't...
I don't have any money.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.098
Well, it was lovely to meet you,
Miss Page.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.265
[Matt clearing throat]

15:34.892 --> 15:36.853
You don't have any money
and we don't have any clients.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.313
Maybe we can help each other.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.148
Tell me, how did you know Mr. Fisher?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.569
We worked together.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.490
[sighs]

15:49.491 --> 15:50.825
And your place of employment?

15:50.908 --> 15:54.161
Union Allied Construction.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.289
I'm a secretary.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.377
Daniel worked downstairs in Legal.

16:02.003 --> 16:06.048
[stuttering] I didn't know him very well.
But he was always nice, you know?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.135
But it's hard to meet people in the city,

16:09.218 --> 16:11.428
so I asked him
if he would have a drink with me.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.097
You asked him?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.267
[voice breaking]
Like I said, he was a nice guy.

16:18.728 --> 16:22.106
We met at the Three Roads bar,
on 49th Street.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.692
We had a few drinks,
and the next thing that I remember

16:24.776 --> 16:28.320
is waking up on the floor of my apartment
covered in blood.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.572
His blood.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.660
No, I'm not stupid.
I know how that sounds.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.164
But I am telling you we met at the bar.
We had a few drinks.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.083
And I don't know what happened after that.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.878
It wasn't me.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.713
Please.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.590
[heart beating steadily]

16:47.674 --> 16:50.635
Please, you have to believe me.
[sniffles]

16:50.718 --> 16:52.720
I didn't kill him.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.350
I believe you, Miss Page.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.244
[sighs]

17:20.289 --> 17:21.958
There's plenty of room over there.
Do you mind?

17:22.542 --> 17:26.003
28,957.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.424
Tell Rigoletto he'll get his money.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.468
Mr. Rigoletto has retired.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.387
His books have been acquired
by my employer.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.099
Ah. Well, you tell him the same thing.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.102
I'd like to show you something.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.106
Do you have a moment?

18:00.913 --> 18:04.626
What is it about college girls
and Monet T-shirts?

18:05.542 --> 18:08.087
Open composition and
the spontaneity reflecting

18:08.170 --> 18:11.465
this transformative time
in their lives, perhaps?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.302
Or maybe they just
like the color blue.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.554
Call her.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.563
[line ringing]

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
Hey, Dad, what's up?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.321
[man] Hi, baby, I'm just checking in.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.074
You need anything?

18:37.909 --> 18:40.870
Uh, yeah,
I actually have a ton of laundry.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.539
I was gonna swing by this weekend
and use the machine.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.542
And then, maybe we could
catch a movie after your shift?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.003
Yeah, yeah.
That'd be great.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.838
Uh, look--

18:50.922 --> 18:53.841
Baby, I got--
I gotta go. I love you, baby.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.885
Love you, too. Bye, Dad.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.391
Now, you see this man here?

19:03.184 --> 19:05.770
If we're being honest
with each other, Mr. Farnum,

19:05.853 --> 19:08.815
I find his methods unpleasant.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.653
But such are the times we live in.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.323
Give us a wave, Mr. Rance.

19:22.829 --> 19:26.498
I told you that I will get you the money.

19:26.582 --> 19:30.294
Such a small sum
is of little interest to my employer.

19:30.377 --> 19:34.006
Your position, however,
that's something we can work with.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.593
[man sighs]

19:41.931 --> 19:43.975
What do you want me to do?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.897
I'm friends with Gary Feinstein
in the DA's office.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.107
I'll give him a call
first thing in the morning,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.358
see where their heads are at.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.694
I'm guessing
they're gonna puff their chests,

19:54.777 --> 19:57.029
but they have to know murder two's a risk.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.323
We end up at manslaughter,
we get the right judge,

19:59.406 --> 20:01.325
-maybe she's out in five to 10--
-We're not taking a deal.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.785
No, this is why they have deals, Matt.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.829
So the straightforward cases
don't waste everybody's time.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.205
I don't think she did it.

20:06.288 --> 20:11.127
She's the sole suspect,
found at the scene, covered in blood,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.964
with the murder weapon
and no defensive wounds.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.300
If they offer anything it'll be a gift,
and we will take that gift.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.011
We do not want this to go to trial.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.137
They don't want this
to go to trial, either.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.471
Why hasn't she been charged yet?

20:22.554 --> 20:25.057
They have 24 hours.
And it's the weekend.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.267
They're gonna take
every last second

20:26.350 --> 20:27.559
to collect the evidence
before they move.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.937
They've got the evidence.
You just laid it out yourself.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.856
This is a good arrest, Foggy.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.734
We should already
be reading about it in the papers.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.028
There's something not right
about this case. I can feel it.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.321
You can feel it?

20:39.405 --> 20:42.992
All right, I'm just gonna say this once,
and we can move on.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.078
You don't necessarily
show the best judgment

20:46.162 --> 20:47.538
when beautiful women are involved, Matt.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.873
How would I even know
if she's a beautiful woman?

20:48.956 --> 20:51.458
I don't know.
It's kinda spooky, actually.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.754
But if there's a stunning woman
with questionable character in the room,

20:54.837 --> 20:57.673
Matt Murdock's gonna find her
and Foggy Nelson is gonna suffer.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.717
[chuckling] All right, I don't disagree
with anything you're saying.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.846
-Thank you.
-But I need you to back me, anyway.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.181
[groans]

21:06.682 --> 21:09.977
All right. Fine.
Let's start with the obvious, then.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.313
If she didn't do it, who did?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.982
We're dead in the water
if we don't give them an alternative.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.275
Agreed.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.071
We need to take
another run at our client.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.158
She may not be guilty, Matt,

21:24.241 --> 21:26.410
but that doesn't mean
Miss Page is telling the truth.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.584
[muffled screaming]

21:42.218 --> 21:43.845
[shrieks]

21:46.097 --> 21:47.556
[cop grunting]

21:49.683 --> 21:50.935
[gagging]

21:57.399 --> 21:59.068
[panting]

21:59.151 --> 22:00.319
I'm sorry.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.571
I'm-- I'm sorry.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.076
[both grunting]

22:08.369 --> 22:09.495
[screaming]

22:10.579 --> 22:12.331
[cop groaning]

22:13.165 --> 22:14.416
[panting]

22:15.792 --> 22:17.003
[screaming]

22:17.086 --> 22:18.337
[indistinct]

22:25.970 --> 22:28.014
I'm gonna make this easy, Detectives.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.891
Get the ADA in here
to release Miss Page

22:29.974 --> 22:33.352
and we'll recommend
to our charming, media-friendly client

22:33.435 --> 22:36.688
that she not plaster the airwaves with
how she was nearly killed in your custody.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.525
And I'll agree not to make cooing noises
for the rest of this meeting

22:39.608 --> 22:41.818
when I think of the civil suit
that we have on our hands.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.237
How do you know they're not charging her?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.157
Besides the fact that you were required
to do so four hours ago...

22:46.240 --> 22:48.284
if you were gonna do it at all?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.161
That's an excellent question.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.746
Along with how the security cameras
on Miss Page's detention area

22:52.829 --> 22:54.456
went on the fritz
right before the assault.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.251
Yeah, we'd like to speak to Mr. Farnum
about that, as well as what--

22:57.334 --> 22:58.920
Get in line.
He'll be arraigned in the morning.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.172
Get my client released.
Don't make me ask again.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.259
[whispering]

23:09.180 --> 23:11.098
I'll call the ADA.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.936
But you take that tone with me again,
I don't care if you're blind,

23:15.019 --> 23:17.438
I'll kick the shit out of you.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.565
Really?
We're going there?

23:24.861 --> 23:26.822
[scoffs] That was pleasant.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.325
It doesn't make any sense.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.785
ADA had everything they needed.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.371
Unless they had too much.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.873
What?
What am I missing?

23:37.959 --> 23:39.751
Maybe someone else
was in her apartment that night.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.087
Maybe they have evidence.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.964
That's Brady material.
They'd have to turn that over.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.423
Only if she were charged.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.718
She hangs herself in her cell,
this all goes away.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.471
[exhales sharply]
Let's get her some clothes

23:50.554 --> 23:51.805
and get the hell out of here.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.608
Couldn't find any milk.
I hope it's okay.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.859
[Matt] We have tea now?

24:03.942 --> 24:06.362
[Foggy] I stole it from
the financial office next door.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.658
[sighs]

24:11.742 --> 24:12.951
How are you holding up?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.245
Better.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.456
Thanks for getting me out.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.707
[Foggy] Don't thank us yet.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.916
Just because they released you

24:20.001 --> 24:21.585
doesn't mean
they won't eventually bring charges.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.462
[Matt] Which means it's crucial
you don't speak to anyone

24:23.545 --> 24:26.423
other than the two of us
about what happened.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.219
I don't have anyone to talk to, anyway.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.388
Do you have somewhere
you can stay tonight?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.515
My apartment's not far.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.975
You can't go back there.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.937
Miss Page, our immediate priority
is to keep you safe.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.940
And in order to do that, we're gonna need
to have a frank discussion.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.861
Okay.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.988
Do you know who's trying to kill you?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.449
No.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.077
Do you know why
they're trying to kill you?

25:00.999 --> 25:02.334
Yes.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.671
-[recording machine turns on]
-[Karen] I, uh, work...

25:06.922 --> 25:11.260
Worked in the financial department
at Union Allied.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.139
They're overseeing
the bulk of the government contracts

25:15.222 --> 25:16.723
for the West Side reconstruction.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.017
I've seen their signs
all over Hell's Kitchen.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.939
The last two years
have transformed the business.

25:24.022 --> 25:27.109
There's new owners, new grants,
new contracts.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.321
Yeah, the world watched
half of New York get destroyed.

25:30.404 --> 25:31.738
That's a lot of sympathy.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.826
And Union Allied benefited
from every dollar of it.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.622
I was the secretary
for the chief accountant.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.335
And one of my jobs...

25:45.919 --> 25:49.298
was to coordinate the pension claims
for the company.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.929
About a week ago, I was emailed a file
called, "Pension Master."

25:58.849 --> 26:02.561
It must have been meant for my boss,
but I made the mistake of opening it.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.480
I'm guessing it wasn't the pension fund.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.735
It wasn't the size of the pension fund.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.240
I couldn't believe the numbers.

26:15.491 --> 26:19.035
But it was still being designated
as company pension.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.998
And it was constantly adjusted.
Money coming in and money going out.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.791
-Going where?
-I don't know.

26:24.875 --> 26:29.421
It was coded routing numbers,
but we are talking a lot of money.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.548
What did you do with the file?

26:32.841 --> 26:37.846
Well, I told my boss, Mr. McClintock,
about it, and he laughed it off.

26:38.847 --> 26:43.727
He said that it was a theoretical model
that they were screwing around with.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.355
I knew something was wrong.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.735
I just-- I thought maybe
it was just him, you know?

26:51.818 --> 26:53.737
Embezzling or whatever.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.784
So, how did Daniel Fisher
figure into this?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.453
Danny worked in the legal department.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.458
And I didn't know him very well.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.128
But he was nice,
so I asked him to meet me after work.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.674
I don't know how they knew.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.553
They must have people watching me.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.431
They must have people everywhere.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.934
All I did was ask him for a drink.

27:25.186 --> 27:28.355
And I start to tell him
about what I found

27:28.439 --> 27:30.065
and things got blurry.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.858
Like I was drugged.

27:32.984 --> 27:36.988
And the next thing I know,
I wake up... back in my apartment,

27:37.072 --> 27:38.532
covered in blood.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.080
They killed him...

27:47.791 --> 27:49.501
because of me.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.671
And he had a family.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.592
A little boy.

28:00.721 --> 28:03.515
-I need to get out of here. I'm sorry.
-We can't advise that, Miss Page.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.727
No, you don't understand.
Either you're with them or you're not.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.479
And if you're with them,
then I'm dead already.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.940
And if you are not, then I cannot
have anybody else die because of me.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.443
-We can protect ourselves, Miss Page.
-No, you can't. Not from them.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.527
-Miss Page--
-No.

28:15.611 --> 28:17.488
-We can't let you go home.
-Please, just--

28:21.032 --> 28:22.117
[sobbing]

28:26.455 --> 28:27.623
She can stay with me.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.166
Just for tonight,
until we figure something out.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.546
I'll keep you safe, Karen.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.392
I don't have much in the way of food,
but there's a Thai place on the corner.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.646
If we order now, it should get here
by the time I make up the bedroom for you.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.689
It's a little dark in here.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.107
I never...

28:54.190 --> 28:56.943
Uh, light switch
is on the wall to your left.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.863
So, uh, [sighs] want some food?

28:59.946 --> 29:01.448
Uh, no, I'm not...

29:03.158 --> 29:05.327
Would you have a shirt
I could borrow, maybe?

29:05.411 --> 29:08.539
This one's a little wet,
and I'm a Hellions fan.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.041
[chuckles] Then don't tell Foggy.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.794
Let me grab something for you.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.629
And, really,
I can't put you out of your bedroom.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.256
I'll be just fine on the couch.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.759
From what I understand
about my living room,

29:20.842 --> 29:22.761
that might not be true.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.441
Holy shit!

29:35.524 --> 29:36.692
[Matt] Went up a year ago.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.029
I'm told the co-op nearly rioted,

29:41.112 --> 29:44.115
some oversight from
the developer's agreement.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.494
Upside is, nobody wanted it

29:47.578 --> 29:49.788
and I got a corner apartment
at a hell of a discount.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.253
Thanks.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.394
Can I ask a personal question?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.773
I haven't always been blind.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.943
I guess that's what
everyone wants to know.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.654
That or, "How do you comb your hair?"

30:22.738 --> 30:24.656
How do you comb your hair?

30:25.699 --> 30:27.743
Honestly, you just--
You hope for the best.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.787
Thank you.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.126
You wanna sit?

30:38.420 --> 30:40.088
How did it happen?

30:41.965 --> 30:43.425
Car accident.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.844
When I was nine.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.388
Must have been rough.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.098
No. I made it through.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.437
Do you remember what it was like...

30:55.521 --> 30:57.606
To... To see?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.316
I, um...

31:01.735 --> 31:03.362
Yes, I remember.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.698
I can't imagine what that must be like.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.074
[chuckles]

31:10.452 --> 31:13.455
You know,
I'm supposed to say I don't miss it.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.083
That's what they teach you
in trauma recovery.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.545
Define yourself by what you have,

31:19.628 --> 31:23.298
value the differences,
make no apologies for what you lack.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.053
And it's all true, for the most part...

31:32.433 --> 31:34.851
but it doesn't change the fact that I...

31:35.769 --> 31:38.814
I'd give anything
to see the sky one more time.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.699
Do you mind
if I ask you some questions now?

31:55.497 --> 31:56.540
Uh...

31:56.623 --> 31:58.041
-Go ahead.
-You just nodded, right?

31:58.124 --> 31:59.167
[chuckles]

31:59.960 --> 32:01.545
Uh, yeah.

32:01.628 --> 32:02.754
Okay.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.926
Here's what I don't understand.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.346
[clears throat]

32:11.430 --> 32:14.390
I'm the man in charge of the pension funds

32:14.475 --> 32:19.395
and I find out one of my secretaries
has discovered my illicit activity.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.564
To make matters worse,

32:20.647 --> 32:23.108
she's now telling people
about said activity.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.110
Which, obviously, I can't have.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.821
So I decide to take action.

32:30.406 --> 32:31.867
But why don't I kill you?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.119
They tried.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.663
Yeah, the second time.
In the jail.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.708
But the first time,
they left you alive. Why?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.379
What were they trying to do?
Frame you?

32:45.756 --> 32:49.384
Now, the second time,
maybe that's a change of plan.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.263
Something doesn't go their way,
something sloppy at the crime scene.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.349
Two lawyers show up out of the blue
before their people can get to you.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.729
So they figure, okay,
maybe Karen hangs herself in her cell,

33:00.812 --> 33:02.898
and this thing gets swept under the rug.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.609
But the first time...

33:07.318 --> 33:08.862
The first time,
they're not trying to kill you.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.698
They're trying to discredit you.
They're trying to scare you.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.618
And the only reason
that they would do that...

33:15.577 --> 33:18.329
is if you have something that they want.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.960
So, I've been trying to think about
what that could be,

33:24.044 --> 33:26.630
and the only thing I've come up with...

33:26.713 --> 33:28.549
[heart beating]

33:28.632 --> 33:31.009
...is the Union Allied pension file.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.848
Did you keep the file, Karen?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.686
[beating grows faster]

33:40.769 --> 33:42.228
No.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.234
As soon as I asked my boss about it,
he took it away from me.

33:50.612 --> 33:54.324
The IT guys, they came
and they wiped the computers.

33:55.033 --> 33:59.830
Believe me, a part of me wishes
I'd made a copy for myself...

34:01.957 --> 34:04.125
but I guess I'm just not that smart.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.589
Ah, well, it was just a thought.

34:26.607 --> 34:29.317
It's freezing this high up.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.444
Next time we're meeting at Per Se.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.573
I'll domesticate you boys yet.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.784
This would be a balmy day
in Samara, Leland.

34:37.868 --> 34:42.623
Yes, it's perfect Chechnyans-kidnap-
a-preschool weather, Vladimir.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.001
[sighs]

34:46.710 --> 34:50.631
Can you at least pretend to be cold?
It's unsettling.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.173
[laughing]

34:52.924 --> 34:54.467
[speaking Mandarin]

35:00.556 --> 35:02.392
Anyone here speak Chinese?

35:03.977 --> 35:05.436
Nobu?

35:06.562 --> 35:08.231
The man is Japanese.

35:08.314 --> 35:10.817
I know, I know.
I just thought that...

35:11.735 --> 35:12.903
Forget it.

35:14.905 --> 35:16.406
[elevator door opens]

35:20.827 --> 35:23.371
Oh, please tell me he's right behind you.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.917
Unfortunately, my employer
is attending to other matters.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.837
He apologizes to you in particular,
Madame Gao.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.130
[speaking Russian]

35:33.256 --> 35:35.425
We do not deal with lap dogs.

35:35.508 --> 35:36.802
Tell Mister--

35:36.885 --> 35:39.512
We don't say his name.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.100
Woof, woof.

35:44.685 --> 35:48.354
[man] He would like to know
why you're short on the cargo totals.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.527
There was a problem on the docks.

35:55.654 --> 36:00.283
Barrett and our men were attacked.
Some moodak in a black mask.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.327
[laughs] And you bought that?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.746
-[speaking Russian]
-[Leland] Okay, calm down.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.041
Fine, we'll go with
the man-in-black story.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.127
Our men would not lie.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.921
I said I'm on board.

36:14.965 --> 36:18.176
I'm glad to hear there's some new blood
running around out there.

36:18.259 --> 36:23.849
Heroes and their consequences
are why we have our current opportunities.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.643
Now can we review
the latest numbers and--

36:27.728 --> 36:30.230
Tell me more about this man.

36:30.313 --> 36:34.192
Took Barrett and our guys out
while they were loading the container.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.651
[speaking Mandarin]

36:44.369 --> 36:45.954
[chuckles]

36:46.037 --> 36:49.207
She wants to know if this man
stole the shipment for himself.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.167
No.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.129
He let the women go.

36:55.463 --> 36:58.174
He took out your men. How?

36:58.842 --> 37:00.010
Caught them by surprise.

37:00.927 --> 37:01.928
Beat them.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.306
-With his bare hands.
-Four men with his bare hands?

37:05.390 --> 37:08.018
That is what we were told.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.021
Perhaps you should
have been there yourself.

37:11.104 --> 37:15.358
[scoffs] Again, I have to ask,
why do we care?

37:15.441 --> 37:18.403
Every time one of these guys
punches someone through a building,

37:18.486 --> 37:20.446
our margins go up 3%.

37:20.530 --> 37:21.572
We should be celebrating.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.866
This is different.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.659
My employer will be...

37:25.827 --> 37:26.953
displeased...

37:27.871 --> 37:30.916
we're being inconvenienced
by a lone vigilante.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.251
Then he should tell me to my face.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.506
This is on you.
Deal with it. Quietly.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.759
We must be quiet, yes.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.680
We would not want another
Union Allied situation, would we?

37:45.764 --> 37:48.934
Big, loud, lot of questions.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.268
We're handling it.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.979
Like you keep saying
you're handling Prohaszka?

37:53.063 --> 37:55.065
We're in the process of negotiating
with Mr. Prohaszka.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.732
Negotiating?

37:56.817 --> 37:59.444
Maybe we handle our problem same way.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.905
Sit down with this man in black,
break bread.

38:01.988 --> 38:06.993
I think what Anatoly's trying to say
is that it would be in our best interests

38:07.077 --> 38:11.832
for Union Allied to be tidied up
as expeditiously as possible.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.624
As I said...

38:16.294 --> 38:17.963
we're handling it.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.216
[thunder rumbling]

39:06.219 --> 39:07.595
[door creaking]

39:21.026 --> 39:22.235
[sniffles]

39:22.986 --> 39:24.237
[breathing heavily]

39:41.421 --> 39:42.713
[sighing]

39:54.517 --> 39:55.685
[screaming]

40:08.573 --> 40:09.740
[clicks]

40:20.251 --> 40:21.711
[both yelling]

40:31.762 --> 40:32.888
-[bones cracking]
-Ahhh!

41:00.000 --> 41:01.042
[straining]

41:34.659 --> 41:36.161
[Jack] Get up, Matty.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.121
Hey.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.581
Let's go, finish up.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.798
I'm tired, Dad.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.470
Hey, I don't want you to
end up like your old man.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.349
I never studied.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.145
Look where it got me.

42:40.975 --> 42:44.729
Come on, Matty.
Get to work.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.251
[both grunting]

43:15.301 --> 43:16.427
[grunting]

43:44.789 --> 43:45.998
[grunting]

43:56.676 --> 43:58.761
-[bone cracking]
-Ahhh!

44:09.855 --> 44:11.524
[metal clinking]

44:17.738 --> 44:19.282
[groaning]

44:26.872 --> 44:28.082
[grunting]

44:29.709 --> 44:31.085
[panting]

44:38.676 --> 44:40.052
[groaning]

44:49.770 --> 44:51.063
Who...

44:55.860 --> 44:57.528
What the hell?

44:58.654 --> 45:01.198
I'll get this into the right hands.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.742
No, you can't.

45:03.743 --> 45:07.288
You can't take it to the police.
You can't trust anyone.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.041
Then we tell everyone.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.009
[breathing heavily]

45:25.598 --> 45:28.643
DNA evidence
will put Rance at the murder scene.

45:28.726 --> 45:32.187
B and E gone sideways,
his records altered in support.

45:32.272 --> 45:36.526
Mr. Farnum's bail has been arranged for
through the usual channels.

45:36.609 --> 45:39.069
Leland's to cover our exposure
on the financials

45:39.153 --> 45:41.614
and McClintock takes the fall
for Union Allied.

45:41.697 --> 45:44.950
[man on phone] We can't have McClintock
speaking to the authorities.

45:45.034 --> 45:46.411
Pills.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.705
He overdosed less than an hour ago.

45:49.789 --> 45:52.292
The remaining concerns
will be attended to shortly.

45:52.375 --> 45:55.336
Rance was a professional.
How was he subdued?

45:57.505 --> 45:58.881
I'm looking into it.

45:58.964 --> 46:01.342
What about the girl?

46:01.426 --> 46:04.429
Should I make the appropriate arrangements
for her, along with the others?

46:04.512 --> 46:07.807
No. Everything she knows
is already in the papers.

46:07.890 --> 46:10.935
Her lawyers, Nelson and Murdock.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.854
Ambulance chasers. They're clean.

46:13.938 --> 46:16.190
Start a file.
They may be of use.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.651
Understood.

46:20.152 --> 46:21.321
-[Karen] Here you go.
-[both chuckling]

46:22.196 --> 46:23.698
[Karen] So I know it's not much...
[Matt] Hmm.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.865
...in the way of repayment.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.452
But it is, um, my grandmother's recipe,

46:27.535 --> 46:30.996
and she made me promise
only to serve it to my future husband.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.206
[Matt chuckles]

46:32.289 --> 46:34.834
You know, it's, like,
filled with virtue or something.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.878
I thought I detected
a whiff of virtue in there.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.339
Not that I'm complaining,

46:39.422 --> 46:41.341
but you really should be
thanking the nut in the mask.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.800
He's not a nut.

46:44.009 --> 46:46.512
-I mean, he's a little weird, maybe--
-We're just glad you're okay.

46:46.596 --> 46:47.805
[Foggy] Hear, hear!

46:48.973 --> 46:52.184
Well, if it weren't for you two,
I'd still be in that cell.

46:52.267 --> 46:53.519
Hmm.

46:53.603 --> 46:58.190
Job's easy when your client's innocent.
All you did was tell the truth.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.276
Yeah, but you listened.

47:06.115 --> 47:09.660
Oh, and don't get us wrong,
we're still gonna bill you.

47:09.744 --> 47:12.497
Just as soon as we figure out
how to make bills.

47:12.580 --> 47:13.581
[laughs]

47:13.664 --> 47:16.208
I did notice that you could
use some help around here.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.669
And I owe you.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.755
Maybe I could clean the place up a bit.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.215
Is this place messy?

47:24.133 --> 47:27.720
Our firm is very prestigious
and discerning, Miss Page.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.389
Do you have any prior experience

47:29.472 --> 47:33.100
hiding electrical cords
[chuckling] up in ceiling tiles?

47:33.183 --> 47:34.602
Uh, no, but...

47:35.520 --> 47:36.937
I'll work for free.

47:38.773 --> 47:39.857
-[Matt] Yeah, you're hired.
-[Karen chuckles]

47:39.940 --> 47:41.651
[Foggy] You just got hired!

47:53.370 --> 47:55.581
You can leave the lights off.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.501
[mouse clicking]

49:00.312 --> 49:02.356
-[basket thuds]
-[girl screaming]

49:05.776 --> 49:07.987
[Matt grunting]

50:39.411 --> 50:40.495
Hey! Come on!

50:52.007 --> 50:53.425
Ahh! Daddy!

50:53.508 --> 50:54.635
Daddy!

50:54.719 --> 50:55.720
[speaking Russian]

50:55.803 --> 50:57.346
No! Daddy!

51:11.902 --> 51:13.362
[indistinct conversations]

51:17.908 --> 51:20.160
[overlapping voices]

51:24.874 --> 51:26.166
[boy] Daddy!

51:26.959 --> 51:28.210
Help!

51:28.293 --> 51:29.670
Daddy!

51:30.963 --> 51:32.422
[boy screaming]

51:34.634 --> 51:36.636
[dramatic music playing]
