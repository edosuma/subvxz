01:25.733 --> 01:28.236
Hello!
What?

01:28.467 --> 01:31.471
Hey girl sit!
Sit therel-What in a movie?

01:32.233 --> 01:34.611
Girl sit here! What is it?
I'm taken in a movie!

01:34.800 --> 01:38.441
My god, when you become
a movie star like this -

01:38.600 --> 01:40.580
- I need to conduct the
ritualAatukal Ponkala.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.077
At that time my photo will also
appear on the newspaper, is it?

01:43.267 --> 01:46.111
My Goddess change our life.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.111
'If there is a chance you may
get such life changing calls -'

01:52.233 --> 01:55.214
'-within next 2 hours please
switch off your mobile phone...!!'

03:40.767 --> 03:43.338
'Before the emergence
of wayfarers winning SSLC -'

03:43.467 --> 03:44.468
'A big exam time...'

03:54.733 --> 03:59.478
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

04:11.433 --> 04:17.041
Copying! Remake!
Fellow what is your name?

04:17.399 --> 04:22.179
Praveen. S

04:24.467 --> 04:28.609
Your name?
Santhosh Viswanath.

04:33.033 --> 04:36.173
'Not to tutor, not to father, not to
brother-in-law" Movie is dedicated -

04:36.333 --> 04:39.337
'- to you for showing the courage
to watch by paying money'

05:54.333 --> 05:57.974
It has become a habit now a days
to begin a movie through narration.

05:58.133 --> 06:00.113
So, lets also start like that.

06:00.333 --> 06:05.009
This is a Malayalam novelist
which you or I can never forget.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.270
M.P Am bujakshan.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.710
Panikar, greetings. -Greetings
heading to where with file and all.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.038
Why, today not opened the shop?
No, today not opening the shop.

06:16.067 --> 06:18.377
Ambujaksha, the ceremony
is on day after tomorrow -

06:18.533 --> 06:20.410
- at least stitch the blouse tomorrow.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.274
Blouse?

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

06:38.500 --> 06:43.108
Elderly citizens, blind,
physically differed, ladies'

06:44.700 --> 06:50.707
No seat for literary people. A society
that doesn't know to respect writers.

06:53.467 --> 06:56.004
Perhaps a person who
might have read my novel.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.745
Take the balance.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.407
Over here?
Ernakulam, Rs.100.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.577
What Rs. 100?
Take 50 paise.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.575
Take from that one.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.247
We've seen Ambujakshan trying
to make 'Chirakodinja Kinavukal'

07:15.333 --> 07:17.745
- and failing. (Chirakodinja
Kinavukal-dreams with broken wings)

07:18.000 --> 07:22.244
After that 18 years have passed.
Assistant directors during that time -

07:22.400 --> 07:25.244
-became directors. Those who
are born during that time.

07:25.367 --> 07:28.507
Now they have become mature
to watch adults only movie.

07:28.633 --> 07:31.113
New generation
movies also evolved.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.246
The novel 'Chirakodinja
Kinavukal' to convert it to -

07:34.333 --> 07:38.372
- a new generation screen play. To
discuss with director and producer.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.037
This journey is for that.

07:40.667 --> 07:44.479
For 'Chirakodinja Kinavukal'
Lal Jose from Thayangiri Jetty.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.045
M.T is not that much interested
to write screen play like before.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.609
Padmarajan, Lohidadas and
Damodharan mash has demised.

07:54.767 --> 07:58.044
As son has joined the job
Sreenivasan is also side-lined.

07:58.233 --> 08:01.237
Son Ambujakshan this
is the best time.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.373
While these kind of things
are written about ladies.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.108
These things which aren't there.
How can they not commit suicide?

08:19.300 --> 08:24.045
These people who writes screen
play, can't be trusted, isn't it sir?

09:04.267 --> 09:05.712
This way!

09:14.500 --> 09:17.970
Obstructing the route
of tomorrow's Malayala Cinema?

09:19.733 --> 09:21.303
Greetings
Yes sir.

09:21.433 --> 09:26.246
I'm Malayalam novelist, no,
new generation screen playlist.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.537
<i>MP'.
MI?</i>

09:27.700 --> 09:30.977
Not M.T! M.T is not
new generation, is it?

09:31.233 --> 09:33.975
I'm M.P Am bujakshan.
Sorry sir.

09:34.267 --> 09:38.579
Which is the room of director Reghu
Uthaman, sir? - 116 Suit no:9, sir.

09:39.333 --> 09:40.778
Sir, sixth floor.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.579
M.P Am bujakshan.
Can I come inside?

10:09.167 --> 10:11.579
'Sagar Elias Jacky"
Sethuramaiyer CBI..'

10:11.767 --> 10:12.575
'Rathi chechi..'

10:12.700 --> 10:15.704
'If they all can come inside
Ambujakshan can indeed come inside'.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.602
Why not? Come inside.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.610
This is producer
Joppan Ezhupunna.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.244
Became a producer only
due to satellite from movie.

10:28.433 --> 10:31.471
If foolishness is the criterion,
then he will be the Mr. India.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.312
Yea, greetings.
Greetings.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.242
Please come, come.
Sorry I'm bit late.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.706
Had to stitch an
urgent wedding blouse.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.014
Have you tried to call us?
Don't have mobile phone, no?

10:46.233 --> 10:50.238
Won't use sir. Busy people like
Jagathy Sreeku mar, Um men Chandy -

10:50.333 --> 10:53.041
- A.K Antony never
used mobile phones.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.579
In a way that is good.
Greetings sir-Greetings.

10:56.300 --> 11:02.012
This is Reghu Uthaman. More
cunning to lure producers than viewers.

11:02.233 --> 11:05.180
Total produced number of movies
are eight and failed movies are sixteen.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.143
Because the last movie
crashed from the 8th floor!

11:09.033 --> 11:12.139
Actually Joppan sir
was to remake Chemeen.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.405
None of the actors with satellite
were ready to work under the sun.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.341
Will become dark skinned!

11:17.567 --> 11:21.379
Its not workers taken from Bengal
and Bihar, must bring actors.

11:22.367 --> 11:25.541
Reghu had told that it'll also have
taste and smell of Chemeen(prawns)

11:25.733 --> 11:30.079
Won't it have Ambujashan? -Sir
this is not prawns, its lobster.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.744
While discussing about
lobster, the big catch has come.

11:34.033 --> 11:35.569
Keep it there.

11:36.100 --> 11:39.104
My goodness Reghu Uthaman
sir, Greetings. -Greetings.

11:39.267 --> 11:42.248
Went to see the previous movie
of sir, didn't get the ticket.

11:43.233 --> 11:47.204
Theater people said at least there
should be 15 people to issue ticket!

11:47.300 --> 11:49.246
Why is it like that sir?

11:51.800 --> 11:56.579
Hello, yea. Vazhoor Jose.
Tell Jose.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.377
Youth director Reghu
Uthaman's new film's -

11:59.533 --> 12:01.376
- paperwork has started,
give one news like that.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.741
Yes, yes its needed, youth director.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.646
For the movie people and members
of youth congress, whatever be -

12:08.767 --> 12:10.576
- the age, 'youth' can be added.

12:10.767 --> 12:15.045
As per the numerology, Chirakodinja
Kinavukal requires one more letter.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.508
That is what the
astrologer has told.

12:16.767 --> 12:19.577
Because of that before' Kinavukal'
I've added one more 'Kee'

12:19.767 --> 12:23.180
My goodness then it'll be read as
Chirakodinja Kee Kinavukal, is it?

12:23.433 --> 12:27.438
No, now in Malayalam which
director has got the original spelling?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.479
That is never an issue to viewers,
what they need is habits.

12:30.633 --> 12:35.309
Habits? -In a movie when a
person rides bike for a long time.

12:35.467 --> 12:36.969
There should be a bike accident!

12:37.167 --> 12:40.410
When the hero falls to a flume,
should cling to wild creepers.

12:40.633 --> 12:43.307
The forest dwellers who goes to
collect honey should come and save.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.539
During the times of an urgency the
car should get started at the 3 rd time.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.147
Only after vomiting
should become pregnant.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.075
<i>When ever the character
'm the movie turns oh the 'N.</i>

12:52.233 --> 12:55.237
The news should appear that
favors the character in the movie.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.543
To change the habits
Malayalee won't agree that fast.

13:00.367 --> 13:04.577
Because of that our movie
should have all these habits.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.440
Ambujakshan, now you
may start telling the story.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.545
One minute okay.

13:12.133 --> 13:20.609
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

13:21.167 --> 13:24.410
Its a habit from long ago to get
the kick must stand and drink.

13:25.200 --> 13:31.082
Am bujaksha, must feel like watching
the movie inside the theater.

13:31.267 --> 13:32.575
Yea, can start.

13:38.533 --> 13:44.313
At first should write and show thanks
to good natives of Thayangiri.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.343
They are compatriots stupid
fellows only but perhaps -

13:47.500 --> 13:49.104
- tomorrow may give
some citizen's reception.

13:49.367 --> 13:51.506
Ambujaksha our movie is
new generation, isn't it?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.477
Because of that.
Now this movie's name..

13:53.667 --> 13:54.372
Look, Am bujaksha -

13:54.467 --> 13:56.708
- my grandfather who is dead his
photo must be shown at first.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.740
He only started our prawns
hatchery in the beginning.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.239
Grandpa, beacon lead us...

14:01.433 --> 14:04.676
After that Chirakodinja
Kinavukal should come.

14:11.100 --> 14:15.446
Chirakodinja Kinavukal
(dreams with broken wings)

14:22.067 --> 14:27.141
Years back one Friday (Doesn't
mind if its Saturday or Sunday)

15:02.567 --> 15:05.241
Don't do anything, don't do!

15:16.233 --> 15:18.110
Like all love stories -

15:18.367 --> 15:21.348
- our cinema should also have
a flash back in the beginning.

15:28.267 --> 15:32.409
Seen in all the movies walking here
and there in front of the delivery room.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.375
What is this for?

15:35.433 --> 15:40.405
This is not the birth of a hero
in this movie, its heroine's birth.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.640
Is it male baby?
No female baby.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.740
Here hold this.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.975
What name to put for the baby?

16:09.400 --> 16:12.244
Like what Adoor
Gopalakrishnan sir has -

16:12.400 --> 16:15.142
-told should have a
Malayalee genre name.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.134
Sumathi.

16:19.400 --> 16:24.213
AI free being present in broiler
chicken. Like all girls.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.747
Sumathi, also before reaching
high school became matured.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.177
But..

16:32.800 --> 16:37.800
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

16:48.100 --> 16:50.671
Doctor!
Its a very serious matter.

16:51.033 --> 16:52.774
Will walk and talk, come.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.612
That is only to say a
miracle should happen.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.711
To save one miracle should happen.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.981
Urgently Sumathi requires
some blood. -Will give doctor.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.377
Like what you think Sumathis is
not ordinary blood group.

17:03.600 --> 17:07.309
Rarest of the rare
Bombay 0+ group.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.240
Only very few people
in India is having that!

17:11.767 --> 17:15.374
We've passed the message to all
blood banks and hospitals in the country.

17:16.767 --> 17:19.680
A Malayelee boy atAhmedabad
and he is willing -

17:20.099 --> 17:21.636
- they started half an hour back.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.240
No one should know Sumathi
has got Bombay O +ve group.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.605
She is a girl, no? Tomorrow what
if good proposals doesn't come?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.440
In some movies and
all we've done like this.

18:07.633 --> 18:10.045
On this I'll never do it.

18:16.433 --> 18:18.413
My goodness! My mother!

18:25.000 --> 18:29.745
My Sumathi started this enquiry right
from knowing your blood group.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.114
A person who has given blood long
back, to find him is it Hindi movie?

18:36.667 --> 18:39.079
Did you forget what
you studied in 5th standard?

18:40.100 --> 18:43.741
Can't find it on internet then how
can it be on this rotten directory?

18:44.100 --> 18:46.444
I'm going. My class is over.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.112
You sit here searching
your thin mustached boy.

18:54.800 --> 18:59.715
As it is in a movie, the wood cutter
should stay in Varikasherri Mana.

19:00.333 --> 19:07.342
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

19:07.500 --> 19:12.245
Bad omen Mars,
a series of obstacles.

19:18.067 --> 19:20.741
The marriage should
not be procrastinated.

19:21.100 --> 19:24.741
As per this calculation it is seen it
should be done in this running 19th age.

19:25.033 --> 19:30.381
That's a problem. -If not in 19 then
it will take place at the age of 32.

19:30.600 --> 19:35.071
Astrology is a science
as per the god's will.

19:36.100 --> 19:42.540
After crossing the 7 seas, if that
groom comes from west, really good.

19:42.633 --> 19:46.604
Not 7 even if crosses 14, there
is solution for all that in this.

19:47.300 --> 19:50.304
That's it!
Was a thin mustached.

19:52.533 --> 19:55.537
Even now he is right
before my eyes.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.075
Grandma!

20:04.267 --> 20:08.443
Look at this?
No.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.474
<i>This is that Somme“, no?</i>

20:12.133 --> 20:14.079
Not thin mustached.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.576
Good hair.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.712
Grandma look.

20:33.267 --> 20:38.267
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

20:45.500 --> 20:49.107
The hero of the story is
very handsome and smart.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.471
A hero who is always on with
the needs of the people.

20:52.633 --> 20:56.740
Like in all movies. Should
have a foolish friend also.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.273
This guy is that!

21:20.433 --> 21:25.212
Sukumarakurup! - Even police
couldn't find, then how can I?

21:25.733 --> 21:29.374
Is the dress of Bobby
Chemmanoor stitched here?

21:33.133 --> 21:35.704
Shall I send it back? - How many
times do I have to say that?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.276
Not that after all its
own father's isn't it?

21:39.433 --> 21:41.743
The ego of heros.

21:42.700 --> 21:46.978
Stitch like this, thinks
he is Prem Nazir.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.044
Anyway though of
drawing the picture, no?

22:22.167 --> 22:23.475
Bus has come.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.103
Don't just stand watching, come.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.376
Don't you have any other job?

22:43.100 --> 22:46.081
Woodcuttefs daughter has got an
insolence due to money, its on that face.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.744
You don't look at him.

22:49.767 --> 22:53.078
Now really became dusty.
It was not torn, no?

22:57.067 --> 22:58.569
Will see after the class okay.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.112
Please, please just move.

23:26.267 --> 23:31.376
Now only one person can help you.
That apothecary during that time.

23:35.467 --> 23:39.074
L..l was waiting.

23:39.600 --> 23:46.779
One day daughter will come
searching for me, I knew it.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.677
Now where is he?

23:53.333 --> 23:57.338
This is his friend.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.411
Today is Friday, no?

24:01.767 --> 24:08.207
Today he'll be only
at Little Flower Orphanage.

24:08.400 --> 24:13.474
I revealed this secret, not
even he should know it.

24:13.733 --> 24:16.737
That is against medical ethics.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.007
Aunty!

25:14.567 --> 25:17.741
Aunty, come aunty!

Leave child. -Uncle is cooking
biriyani for us for one day, no?

25:23.167 --> 25:25.579
The rest of the 6 days
its done by this aunty.

25:31.234 --> 25:35.580
Aunty, you put this one.
Just hold this.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.277
Smoking is injurious to health.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.140
How many times have I told
not to sit here and smoke?

26:07.233 --> 26:10.737
No one is offended on eating
apples that is sprayed by poison.

26:11.100 --> 26:15.742
Bakkar, my wish is Sumathi
must be wedding to a gulf person.

26:16.233 --> 26:19.407
Shall we call that Atlas
Ramachandran and enquire -

26:19.567 --> 26:21.604
- whether there are
any boys at Salala?

26:21.800 --> 26:26.010
Why? I'll import some
foreign boys like ice fruit.

As a girl was not received
as per the likings of the heart.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.742
Now can I start the
construction of the house, is it not?

33:10.067 --> 33:15.107
Like that as Dushyanthan and
Shakuntala. As Shahjahan and mumtaz.

33:15.267 --> 33:17.406
As Pareekutty and Karuthamma.

33:17.600 --> 33:21.309
The tailor and Sumathi
were in deep love.

33:22.600 --> 33:28.107
That is excellent, Ambujaksha I don't
know what this new generation is.

33:28.300 --> 33:31.338
But the kids have
told there will be newness.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.379
Newness? Why does
Malayalee need newness?

33:34.567 --> 33:38.379
Our is a scrap society living by
boasting on the bygone days.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.273
When talking about
songs, old songs.

33:41.433 --> 33:43.640
When talking politics, during
the times ofAchutha Menon.

33:44.034 --> 33:46.105
Cinema, Padmarajan's cinema.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.247
If so called these talking guys had
gone to theater and seen the movie.

33:49.433 --> 33:52.107
Padmarajan sir's none of
the movies would end up in flop.

33:52.267 --> 33:55.180
Yes, yes. -If someone
take an unique movie.

33:55.334 --> 33:59.248
Waiting to find whether its copying
cyber Sethuraman Iyer people.

33:59.367 --> 34:01.369
Even if hiding away
from these people's eyes.

34:01.534 --> 34:04.071
There are other nuisances,
the fake CD people.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.077
These guys make more
money than the producer.

34:07.767 --> 34:10.373
Then shall we not make
the fake CD of this movie?

34:13.067 --> 34:14.273
No need is it?

34:14.634 --> 34:17.614
By the by as said earlier that
Shahjahan and Shakunthala -

34:17.766 --> 34:20.373
- they might be the relatives of
this tailor in this story, isn't it?

34:29.800 --> 34:32.576
Should have a surprise in the story.
That's there!

34:32.699 --> 34:36.204
To wed Karuthama in
Chem men, how Palani has come.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.347
As a villain of tailor
the Gulf guy is coming.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.711
<i>Driver put one Arabic music.</i>

35:22.100 --> 35:22.669
Okay sir.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.670
Ambujaksha these Gulf people -

35:27.034 --> 35:29.139
- they are routine comedians
in Malayalam cinema, no?

35:29.300 --> 35:33.510
What we need is a villain.
Make this Gulf guy to a U.K guy!

36:05.067 --> 36:10.244
Wow! Why is Jose in this costume?
Now villains are doing comic roles!

36:24.567 --> 36:27.207
Look, at the girl whom
we are going to see.

36:29.767 --> 36:35.342
Only 19 years old more than
that a Malayalee name Sumathi.

36:35.500 --> 36:40.643
Has got a face cut of a movie star, if
gone to movies, a director would wed her.

36:47.267 --> 36:53.309
Bow! So there is also tailoring is it?
Looks like imported from Africa.

36:53.734 --> 36:59.412
InU.K everything is ready made, on
saying 'small' shirt will be given in hand.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.171
Boss, here also on saying
'small' they will give it in hand.

37:02.334 --> 37:04.575
But that should be told at
a bar which is not shut down.

37:20.767 --> 37:22.747
All though these two
actors are one person.

37:23.100 --> 37:28.311
Like in Balram Vls Tharadas on
this movie no one is recognizing.

37:30.667 --> 37:32.977
Oh! Yea good.
Have you come?

37:33.167 --> 37:37.707
As today is world old age day, said
you will serve biriyani along with tailor.

37:38.167 --> 37:40.670
As a bride sitting here
dressed up isn't it?

37:40.800 --> 37:44.304
Go girl!
A time for her to tell jokes.

37:45.100 --> 37:50.049
If your tailor had a mobile phone on
telling could have blocked that U.K guy.

37:50.234 --> 37:53.408
How is that, saying being busy
Jagathy Sreeku mar, Um men Chandy -

37:53.534 --> 37:56.515
- A.K Antony none of
them used mobile phones.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.281
Girl, looks like your
U.K foreigner has arrived.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.507
Boss, that's elephant dung!

38:06.734 --> 38:08.407
There is Elephant and all.
Has send to feed.

38:08.567 --> 38:11.047
But there is no elephant saddle with
a canopy. In its place its a bus.

38:13.667 --> 38:17.205
A really white skinned foreigner.
Don't you want to see?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.645
'Wood-cutter is the
grace of this home'

38:20.767 --> 38:22.246
Yea, the boy has come.

38:23.767 --> 38:27.738
Was the journey fine?
Actually came fast from U.K.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.104
It was tough to
reach here from airport.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.269
But for that there is
no gutter in the sky, no?

38:32.434 --> 38:36.576
Told these fellows not required all
this what to do? Became a land lord, no?

38:36.800 --> 38:38.677
Even though a land
lord, what a simplicity!

38:43.434 --> 38:44.412
Yes, yes.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.778
Nam asth e!

38:48.367 --> 38:50.574
Yea, wants some cool drinks.

38:50.767 --> 38:52.508
Will be getting
good salary at U.K, is it?

38:54.334 --> 38:56.575
Won't you get anything as money?

39:02.667 --> 39:05.079
Only son has come? Son's parents?

39:07.567 --> 39:10.548
I don't have father and mother.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.140
At father Fernando's orphanage
only I was born and grew up.

39:20.100 --> 39:25.049
What happened son?
Can I just look into a distance?

39:31.800 --> 39:36.044
On the Buckingham street
at the 666 number apartment.

39:36.267 --> 39:40.545
Indian born billionaires
for Mr. and Mrs. Nair.

39:40.700 --> 39:44.238
For not having children
and for thinking to adopt -

39:44.400 --> 39:47.540
- a child from native place.
That is my luck.

39:49.434 --> 39:52.972
On the sides of Oak tress stood that
house on those steps of that house.

39:53.133 --> 39:57.639
My small legs toddled, that
was the steps towards millions.

40:01.434 --> 40:04.313
Don't you know Sumathi
has got bad omen of Mars?

40:06.434 --> 40:11.213
If there is bad omen of Mars, marriage
can be done on Monday or Wednesday.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.636
Not saying because
of my daughter -

40:20.167 --> 40:22.238
- she won't move beyond
the line which I draw.

40:22.434 --> 40:23.777
So, that is a nice 'line'!

40:24.267 --> 40:29.267
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

40:38.000 --> 40:44.178
The bill of elephant dung. -For
elephant dung, Rs.100 is more.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.338
Where is the bill for vegetables that
is brought as sights of prosperity?

40:46.467 --> 40:48.640
Rs. 6,999.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.776
For a good thing"
To whom are you saying? - Shhh!

40:53.134 --> 40:55.273
As it is for a good
thing not bargaining.

40:55.467 --> 40:57.504
You settle these people. Here.

40:59.434 --> 41:02.210
You could have bend little more.
Oh, yea!

41:02.367 --> 41:04.278
The case of this person.
Here he comes. -What is it?

41:04.434 --> 41:07.347
Are you all deaf in here? - Look
Sumathi doesn't want marriage now.

41:07.467 --> 41:11.313
Like Tessa, wants to become a
nurse at Bangalore. - One Tessa!

41:12.467 --> 41:15.243
Thinking there is only one,
lulled a lot that is the problem.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.577
If that son intends he can make you
head nurse at the palace in Britain.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.237
Hey child, just tell and
make her understand.

41:22.634 --> 41:24.113
She and her Tessa.

41:28.634 --> 41:29.612
Tessa!

41:30.634 --> 41:35.310
<i>Look, Su, Sun
Give it there.</i>

41:45.767 --> 41:49.078
Take and eat.
Look carefully okay.

41:49.267 --> 41:51.042
Later don't say didn't see and all.

41:51.733 --> 41:54.236
If children wants to speak
directly, let them speak.

41:55.300 --> 41:58.076
That is not required.
Well, that is required.

42:02.067 --> 42:02.568
Go.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.142
Go.

42:21.400 --> 42:25.075
A smart inspector at Scot Land Yard.

42:25.367 --> 42:30.476
A new gen. buddy who sees Kate
Winslet and Victoria Beckham, daily.

42:31.500 --> 42:37.280
Like that a person like me, I thought
I won't like a girl from this country side.

42:38.267 --> 42:41.407
For thinking like
that, I'm extremely sorry.

42:45.334 --> 42:50.181
To see this face I searched on
all the Sumathi's on face book.

42:50.367 --> 42:54.577
Tessa in '22 F K's' photo is
put as profile pic is it?

42:57.267 --> 42:58.678
I need to tell a matter.

42:59.634 --> 43:02.513
Actually I was about
to say that to you.

43:03.300 --> 43:07.510
When one stranger invited
to play 'Candy crush saga' -

43:07.634 --> 43:09.238
- didn't come, is that the one?

43:09.700 --> 43:13.341
I was just testing
Sumathi's character.

43:15.167 --> 43:16.646
You defeated me.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.508

far to what I asked.

44:15.334 --> 44:19.305
How many times have I told, I'm
not in a mental position to love?

44:20.333 --> 44:23.246
What do you know about me?
Will know only if you say.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.705
Like all other rich children -

44:30.134 --> 44:33.707
- in a flat in Bombay my
childhood was full of colors.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.040
Whatever business tension he
had, dad was never late at home.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.577
A home flooded with joy -

44:40.800 --> 44:44.373
- everyday dad used to sit with
me and watch 'Doordarshan'!

44:44.567 --> 44:48.071
Even during severe cough.
Everything overturned suddenly.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.113
That love, happiness everything!

44:55.334 --> 44:59.714
Due to smoking had cancer
father hid that away from us.

45:00.400 --> 45:04.507
After a week, when the
ambulance came.. -And after that?

45:07.300 --> 45:13.444
As I reached back to native, I'm
living in the mercy of uncles!

45:20.500 --> 45:24.573
That is why I said
don't come behind me.

45:24.767 --> 45:29.045
I like not to walk behind
you, like to walk along with you.

45:33.600 --> 45:38.242

our situation will be like that.

45:38.900 --> 45:43.900
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

45:51.300 --> 45:53.576

more for the marriage.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.073
That U.K fraud is asking
whether the honeymoon is at -

45:58.267 --> 46:01.510
- Singapore or Andaman
constantly he is pestering.

46:03.467 --> 46:07.176
Anyway as it is understood that our
marriage will not take place in right way.

46:07.700 --> 46:11.375
Should do something soon or
else it will become a problem.

46:11.567 --> 46:15.640
Sumathi, you don't worry,
I've taken some decisions.

46:16.467 --> 46:20.244
If his entire Scandinavian
police force comes against us.

46:36.267 --> 46:39.737
Fool dial fast to Colonial G.K Pillai's
son in law Circle Inspector.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.605
For all this, what
had happened here?

46:49.567 --> 46:51.569
Didn't you hear the
news of your daughter?

46:51.800 --> 46:55.043
Daughters go bad,
due to mother's bad grooming.

46:55.234 --> 46:57.077
Even othenlvise always
the blame is on ladies.

47:00.267 --> 47:02.577
Hello, wood cutter speaking.

47:03.534 --> 47:06.481
What has got to do
with police men over here?

47:16.067 --> 47:17.546
Sir, there is no one inside.

47:22.434 --> 47:24.744
Hey Ta..Tailor!

47:27.500 --> 47:30.640
Or..Else we'll have to use force.

47:31.434 --> 47:34.779
Surrender I say"
Tailor!

47:35.500 --> 47:38.071
Surrender!
Where are you?

47:40.767 --> 47:44.442
Hello sir, I'm the tailor!

47:46.600 --> 47:48.170
For what?

47:48.367 --> 47:51.109
Will say all that at the station.
Fellow get inside the vehicle.

48:01.700 --> 48:04.271
I know who is behind this one.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.469
He'll bend his knee before me.

48:09.567 --> 48:11.342
Fellow, get inside the vehicle.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.542
Police man, just hold this.
Hey fellow. Come here.

48:16.767 --> 48:19.543
For what matter?
For calling wood cutter, a fool.

48:19.767 --> 48:23.510
Another meaning of fool
is one who lights up.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.974
Will come out.

48:25.434 --> 48:28.210
If it is police station there
should be Gandhiji's photo.

48:28.433 --> 48:29.741
On the C.l's table, there
should be globe.

48:30.067 --> 48:33.207
On the wall, there should be India's
map and government calendar.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.346
Without wearing shirt
two or three convicts.

48:35.567 --> 48:37.478
Selfie with first accused.

48:40.234 --> 48:43.704
To hero should I specially
say to remove the shirt?

48:47.434 --> 48:48.572
Hey fellow!

48:49.534 --> 48:54.347
Sir commissioner will come now.
Who has told him to come here now?

48:54.500 --> 48:57.208
Might be some inspection.
Hell with this inspection!

49:00.734 --> 49:04.045
This is new city police
commissioner K.P Benny.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.076

Or Isarat Qureshi.

49:32.234 --> 49:35.738
Bro, you over here?
That too simply as a tailor.

49:51.300 --> 49:54.509
Only one person from Asia. More
than that one who stitched -

49:54.667 --> 49:57.443
- national flag of
five foreign countries.

49:57.600 --> 50:00.638
He has got 10
heads, the real Ravana.

50:00.800 --> 50:04.509
What man, what is the

50:07.300 --> 50:10.076

50:10.200 --> 50:12.111
I want to see that on my
table tomorrow morning.

50:14.733 --> 50:17.407
As there was no money
to attend IPS exam -

50:18.034 --> 50:21.243
- he removed and gave stud

50:31.634 --> 50:33.614
Hey fellow, haven't
you told its minister's call?

50:33.767 --> 50:37.374
Not that sir, usually in movies during
this time minister will be calling, isn't it?

50:40.333 --> 50:41.778
God has brought bro over here.

50:42.100 --> 50:43.579

50:53.300 --> 50:56.577
Go and tell the boss. Even
if on sending Kerala police.

50:56.734 --> 51:00.580
Even if Indian military is send,
can't touch on my mere hair.

51:03.034 --> 51:07.540
I'll do what I've decided.
You do it what you can.

51:08.334 --> 51:08.744
Come man.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.576
Kashmir terrorist who escaped from
the hands of Bombay police.

51:22.133 --> 51:23.703
- which they have
planned at Kozhikode.

51:24.067 --> 51:31.281
Should guess his pass word and find
it and should copy it on this floppy disk.

51:32.767 --> 51:36.408
Sir like Suresh Gopi sir we typed
and tried legacy and Vappachi.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.479
We also typed and tried Holy Bible.
Computer didn't accept.

51:39.834 --> 51:44.834
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

52:26.634 --> 52:30.207
Sorry bro without any clue.
Clue?

52:31.267 --> 52:34.146
Yes from Elias has
obtained an English book.

52:34.334 --> 52:35.540
As there was no cover -

52:35.634 --> 52:38.581
-to find it, it is send to police
training academy at Hyderabad.

52:39.534 --> 52:43.072
From that bag a map of Kozhikode
marked as Kapad and a fake CD -

52:43.267 --> 52:45.975
- of movie Urmi with
subtitles is found.

52:46.134 --> 52:47.613
If so, should say that before, no?

52:48.634 --> 52:53.310
Kozhikode, Kapad,
Urmi, Kozhikode, Kapad.

53:17.267 --> 53:20.305
Bro, saved the respect
of Kerala police.

53:20.500 --> 53:23.242
As a gift can I buy and
give a Kadhakali head?

53:23.600 --> 53:27.776
That is not required.
For me to stitch the police uniform-

53:28.134 --> 53:29.112
- give the bulk order.

53:29.267 --> 53:31.747
Only that much? Only that
much. - Now itself fax it to DGP.

53:34.800 --> 53:38.179
Still now DGP is our same
old Jaganatha Varma sir, no? - Yes, yes.

53:38.767 --> 53:42.442
Again if Kerala police needs some
requirements like this, just call me.

53:53.667 --> 53:58.673
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

53:58.767 --> 54:01.213
Mother, I'll call you.

54:03.534 --> 54:09.644
Scene 35, tailor is going out from
commissioner's office to meet Sumathi -

54:10.000 --> 54:12.981
- at the hospital.

54:13.334 --> 54:19.307
One second okay, Reghu
Uthaman sir, go on say.

54:19.467 --> 54:22.573
I'm in a meeting. Yes, yes.
Is it video game?

54:24.300 --> 54:28.373
Am bujakshan have you ever told
this story to any other director?

54:28.600 --> 54:31.240
By changing the hero
to soldier's tailor -

54:31.400 --> 54:33.437
- was about to say this
to Major Ravi sir.

54:34.634 --> 54:36.705
Are you writing any such stories?

54:37.133 --> 54:40.012
Now the trend is both
people jointly writing.

54:40.234 --> 54:44.410
So because of that I and my brother
named as Am bu-Thampi Thayangiri.

54:44.567 --> 54:46.547
Is Thayangiri name of a place?

54:47.134 --> 54:50.547
I haven't heard.
Its not a historical place sir.

54:50.634 --> 54:54.309
Then this name of the place has not
appeared on paper due to sex trade.

54:54.600 --> 54:57.376
That is correct.
Yea, there was a planning.

54:59.167 --> 55:02.671
Doesn't mind an actor is
not bigger than the association.

55:07.534 --> 55:09.980
The hero's friend was
planned as Gregory -

55:10.134 --> 55:12.341
-film association has banned him.

55:13.400 --> 55:17.212
Without telling the association he
acted in brother in law's marriage video.

55:17.434 --> 55:19.573
As he is banned should avoid him.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.202
Don't be scared.

55:26.367 --> 55:29.974
That role can done by a
person where no ban touch him!

55:31.434 --> 55:34.074
Ambujakshan you boldly
narrate the remaining story.

55:35.434 --> 55:37.744
Sumathi, take this patient
to the x-ray room okay.

55:40.434 --> 55:41.640
You come here.

55:43.234 --> 55:44.736
There is nothing more to think -

55:45.034 --> 55:48.243
- today night at 11:55's train
we are eloping to Bombay.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.073
To Bombay?

55:50.267 --> 55:55.239
Lower voice. Bombay collector Mr.
Damodarji is my intimate friend.

55:55.400 --> 55:58.347
For us he'll arrange
PWD guest house.

55:58.467 --> 56:00.777
After arranging everything
I'll secretly come home at night.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.740
No need I'll come.

56:04.334 --> 56:06.439
Okay then everything as said.

56:11.334 --> 56:13.177
Sumathi!

56:14.500 --> 56:18.107
What to do with this person?

56:22.567 --> 56:24.171
Don't talk.

56:36.767 --> 56:39.407
On reaching Bom bay..My god.

56:40.134 --> 56:44.480
On going to Bombay, both
should go to Maratha Mandirtheater.

56:44.667 --> 56:47.614
Should watch Shah Rukh Khan's
Dilwale Dulhania movie.

56:48.500 --> 56:53.745
That movie which I and your grand
father saw at Bombay 20 years back.

57:14.467 --> 57:16.071
When I see your love

57:16.167 --> 57:19.410
I feel like I regained the love
of my father and mother.

57:19.734 --> 57:22.340
From now on son's daddy and
mummy are we people, no?

57:22.434 --> 57:23.412
Is it not lady?

57:24.100 --> 57:27.104
Son, you drink and
swallow the pain.

57:29.167 --> 57:30.305
No need uncle.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.076
In front of uncle, I won't drink.

57:38.534 --> 57:42.676
Its that Vagabond, tell him Neelan
has sold the house and gone.

57:44.734 --> 57:47.146
To meet the person who
was staying here before.

57:48.100 --> 57:50.546
For my happiness son
should drink one.

57:51.234 --> 57:53.236
Just give the respect less than that.

58:10.300 --> 58:13.440
For the touchings if
some pickle is received.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.774
What is there in that son.
You stay there. Daughter Sumathi.

58:17.600 --> 58:26.020
Take that pickle.
She is very good in making pickles.

58:27.367 --> 58:28.710
Daughter Sumathi!

58:40.667 --> 58:42.305
Sumathi serve the pickle.

58:47.567 --> 58:51.709
If shy to serve now, no
need again there is time, no?

58:52.134 --> 58:54.239
For not to serve son
is not an outsider, no?

58:57.600 --> 59:01.776
No need uncle on eating
pickles hick-up will come.

59:02.533 --> 59:04.103
Serve it girl.
No.

59:20.634 --> 59:23.638
What is this girl?
That son is not a guest, no?

59:23.767 --> 59:28.216
Tomorrow he is going to marry you,
girls shouldn't be so much insolent.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.310
Look, I can understand
what is there in your mind.

59:35.567 --> 59:39.014
Then listen as far as I'm
alive that won't take place.

59:40.434 --> 59:43.278
So is uncle taming the craines also?

59:47.600 --> 59:51.412
Not because I don't know what to
do, is a girl whose marriage is fixed.

59:59.167 --> 01:00:00.202
Come lady.

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:06.276
What is Sumathi's problem?

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:08.339
Tell to me.

01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:21.742
If your virginity is lost at 8th
standard or kept and forgot some where.

01:00:23.467 --> 01:00:26.073
What I don't have,
I shouldn't expect is it?

01:00:30.367 --> 01:00:35.248
If its marriage, okay marriage or
if its living together okay like that.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.280
When there is anger on the
face, Sumathi is more beautiful.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:57.078
Can I just capture this beauty?

01:00:57.434 --> 01:01:01.177
For gods sake don't come
after me let me live peacefully.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.243
Don't harass me.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.113
Hey are you talking insolence?
I'll show you today.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.373
What are you doing?
Walk I say. - Father please.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.741
Father listen to what I'm saying.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.040
In your mind there is
a penny less tailor.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.042
Hey lady, if I know how to
bring a millionaire -

01:01:25.233 --> 01:01:27.110
- I know how to
conduct marriage also.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:31.647
Then what? Your nursing studies
has come to an end today.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.580

Like in all the movies
when heroine gets upset.

01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:54.010
Sumathi should turn on and
turn off the light repeatedly.

01:01:54.234 --> 01:01:57.238
'Electricity is more valuable
than love, do not waste it'

01:01:57.767 --> 01:02:02.546
Without knowing all this
poor tailor and new friend.

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:17.274
Interval.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.572
Ambujakshan this is not enough.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.010
For the interval there
should be much more punch.

01:02:24.034 --> 01:02:26.014
Prawns is enough, no?

01:02:27.067 --> 01:02:28.637
Prawns is good.

on a movie discussion.

To see the movie jury chair man
has come, I'll just show my face -

I'll come. -Okay then.

Ambujaksha, any way for the
interval, this punch is not enough.

01:03:09.334 --> 01:03:14.044
Like how Suresh Gopi
says, just remember that.

01:03:14.267 --> 01:03:15.143
Like that.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.614
As one goes to piss, the stop should
be in a way as urine shouldn't come.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.642
No hurry take yourtime and think.
We'll go and come, okay.

With a cover in hand, reaches
at the junction and knocks -

- on the door of tailoring shop.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:26.613
During this time, will there be the
tailor expecting the Sumathi there itself?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.409
Or will anything happen to
Sumathi unexpected over there?

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.213
Can leave the viewers on the
needle point of tension -

01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:40.538
- and leave for interval.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:50.451

the door of the tailoring shop.

Used to frequently come and
requests some changes in the story.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:34.707
Saying that the character has
come down and demanded.

At Turkey a museum
is built by writer Pamuk.

01:09:37.567 --> 01:09:39.410
What Mam ukoya?

Not Mamukoya, Pamuk. He is a
foreign writer who has got nobel prize.

What has the character to do here?

01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:51.738
To inform few of my disagreement.
What disagreement?

01:09:56.467 --> 01:09:59.539

have bit of conscience?

by leaving alone at a junction.

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.077
Will anyone leave for interval?

01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:09.073
That too in a state like Kerala.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.636
Am bujakshan you sit.

01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:28.276
As I reached at the tailoring shop
knocked on the door three times.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.238
And then?

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:43.107
Ambujakshan, you tell
the balance story.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.740
At the junction what will
happen to me unexpectedly?

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.081
At the junction..

01:11:01.434 --> 01:11:03.436
As Sumathi was
drenched in rain -

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:07.446
- in that weak moment
lot of people together..

01:11:07.767 --> 01:11:12.045
Vulgarity! The writers has to
bring change in the society, no?

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.074
Why? Writers
can't they have vulgarity?

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.178
In the world, the only book
that doesn't have vulgarity -

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.109
- is the telephone directory.

01:11:20.434 --> 01:11:22.778
The highest number of
rapes happen in the country.

01:11:23.134 --> 01:11:25.375
But on the movie its not allowed.

01:11:26.467 --> 01:11:29.710
Not that how can a person after
studying fashion technology from -

01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:32.071
- Ahamedabad, became
simply a tailor over here?

01:11:32.267 --> 01:11:35.407
Why simply a tailor?
ls tailoring a bad profession?

01:11:35.634 --> 01:11:38.137
Even the Achuthanandhan
was a tailor.

01:11:38.301 --> 01:11:41.214
No, not like that
I've just asked a doubt.

01:11:41.534 --> 01:11:44.674
To clear the doubts at the beginning
of the movie, it will be narrated.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.540
How?

01:11:46.367 --> 01:11:52.340
'The tailor came to this
village with a big baggage of mystery'.

01:11:53.467 --> 01:11:55.504
For stitching blouse
in wrong measurement-

01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:57.979
Tailor Basi who was fled by
pelting stones by com patriots.

01:11:58.134 --> 01:12:03.049
His son, all have thought
he had come for a revenge.

01:12:03.267 --> 01:12:06.111
For Vamana Namboodiri
at Memanaillam.

01:12:06.334 --> 01:12:12.285
An illicit birth from the maid Jannu.
Later thought had come for revenge.

01:12:15.634 --> 01:12:22.017
Few have thought, it is CID's from
Tamil Nadu to prove the case.

01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:26.579
Also doubted it is the Tham puran
who has come to conduct -

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:30.615
-the discontinued
festival at Akarakavil.

01:12:33.067 --> 01:12:35.479
Comrade is there a
bedi to take a match box.

01:12:35.634 --> 01:12:40.242
Also thought he is a
communist under cover.

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:43.574
My fate is my
decisions, saying that dialogue.

01:12:43.767 --> 01:12:48.079
Disag reed with parents, also
thought is a new generation hero.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.306
After coming to the land of
Malayalam and building a bungalow.

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:56.041
Upon marrying a Malayalee girl
which was the promise given to -

01:12:56.234 --> 01:12:59.181
- mother on the death
bed, on knowing that.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.042
The tailor became the most
adorable person of compatriots.

01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:05.010
Then where did that most adorable
guy go, when I was there at the junction?

01:13:05.134 --> 01:13:06.977
Had gone to buy medicine for piles.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:11.048
Good for the hero in Malayala
cinema. This disease?

01:13:11.267 --> 01:13:14.009
People like us who sits
and works, get this disease.

01:13:14.167 --> 01:13:16.272
Showed the sincerity
to the character created.

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:17.538
As far as hero is concerned -

01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:21.046
- no sugar, no cholesterol and
not even gas trouble is allowed.

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:25.376
Then in modern physiology went
to write well known doctrines.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.572
Or can say in one single night went
to evict Daravi, went to Bombay.

01:13:33.467 --> 01:13:37.279
At mid night what had happened
to me unexpectedly Am bujakshan -

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.774
- hadn't said that so far.

01:14:33.367 --> 01:14:34.311
Sumathi!

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:37.542
Daughter!

01:14:41.734 --> 01:14:46.581
Dear mother, don't enquire me any
more. Along with my dear one.

01:14:46.767 --> 01:14:50.647
No with my beloved dear
one, I'm leaving to live together.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.139
On reading that I know the tea cup
will fall in slow motion and it will break.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.745
I know mother will be upset also.

01:15:00.101 --> 01:15:03.105
But still I'm saying mother
should not be upset.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.678
Even though could have
sat in the tailoring shop.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.001
To increase the tension-

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.372
- they should be made to sit
on top of 15th floor building.

01:15:15.434 --> 01:15:19.541
Why can't you stand down stairs?
I'm tired of climbing the steps.

01:15:19.734 --> 01:15:22.010
What is this? This is not aAmal
Neeraj cinema, no?-what's up?

01:15:22.134 --> 01:15:25.411
Looks like there is some issue,
Sumathi is not present at home.

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:27.308
On sniffing your plan
looks like that wood cutter -

01:15:27.434 --> 01:15:30.244
- has shifted her to some where.
Couldn't meet mother and speak.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.312
That fool is there on guard.

01:15:34.567 --> 01:15:38.014
Why don't we plan an eloping?
I'm not there.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.680
Did I know after the interval,
the character will change?

01:15:54.234 --> 01:15:56.236
My goodness where
are you going? Stop there.

01:15:56.434 --> 01:15:58.675
Love, I'll finish both of them.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.511
Good morning fool.

01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:24.377
Uncle are you busy? -No, no why
son, morning itself, this way?

01:16:25.067 --> 01:16:28.674
Where ever in the world,
early morning I'll go to gym.

01:16:32.267 --> 01:16:33.302
Where has Sumathi gone?

01:16:33.734 --> 01:16:36.578
<i>Daughter has gone with
Radar card ta canned gas, m'!?</i>

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:38.975
She won't reach now.

01:16:40.234 --> 01:16:45.234
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

01:17:02.467 --> 01:17:06.176
Yesterday after the dinner felt
like going for a mid night drive.

01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:07.779
It yours and Sumathi's luck.

01:17:08.134 --> 01:17:10.239
Other wise for the
media to celebrate -

01:17:10.467 --> 01:17:12.708
- they would have received
one sensational news.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.107
Now there is no need to check the
good time and all, I've fixed everything.

01:18:05.267 --> 01:18:08.248
As you grew up Sumathi
for 19 years -

01:18:08.534 --> 01:18:13.711
- can I believe that you
can keep her safe for 2 night?

01:18:18.101 --> 01:18:21.981
If not you may tell Mr. Wood cutter!

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.744
Sumathi, writes to tailor...

01:19:12.067 --> 01:19:16.777
I'm in house arrest
please save. PTO

01:19:20.067 --> 01:19:29.078
The key is behind the grand
father's photo. Yours faithfully.

01:19:29.267 --> 01:19:34.080
In 5th standard I've studied, yours
faithfully is for official letter.

01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:38.014
Yea, lovingly.

01:19:41.134 --> 01:19:43.512
If this is not a fake
currency from Pakisthan.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.610
People like Ram Mohan
Singh who belittles me -

01:19:46.767 --> 01:19:48.144
- everyday, I've never
lost my respect.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.509
As a messenger fly to my beloved.

01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:58.347
As no psychiatrist
had traveled..No.

01:19:58.567 --> 01:20:02.344
So far no Rs. 100 had
traveled on such routes -

01:20:02.601 --> 01:20:05.081
- as this 100 rupees is traveling.

01:20:18.401 --> 01:20:21.211
Why there is a change
for this junction?

01:20:21.801 --> 01:20:25.078
Why is any fight going to happen?

01:20:31.001 --> 01:20:33.242
<i>My goodness'.!</i>

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.742
Pal, is there any girl who
doesn't seek good future?

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:41.741
<i>In all</i> the <i>Ganga's
mind</i> there is <i>a Nagavalli.</i>

01:20:42.034 --> 01:20:45.607
Look, there is no point in scorning
on me, go and ask Sumathi.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.600
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

01:21:35.401 --> 01:21:41.215
At Buckingham palace, while
handing over the appointment order -

01:21:41.367 --> 01:21:44.143
- as head nurse of Queen Elizabath.

01:21:44.334 --> 01:21:48.111
Sumathi was happy
and was ready for marriage.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:58.013
In this third world country by
marrying a third rate and not to struggle.

01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:05.046
In an empire where the sun doesn't
set, Sumathi's fate is to live over there.

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:11.247
To understand all that, I believe
Mr.Tailor has got all that brains.

01:22:23.734 --> 01:22:26.271
Also inviting for my bachelor party.

01:22:35.067 --> 01:22:36.740
This is for the award jury.

01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:40.412
On saying the life situation
of tailor is shown symbolically.

01:22:40.567 --> 01:22:43.104
Will give the award, by giving
meanings which aren't there!

01:22:43.467 --> 01:22:46.744
Shashi Anna, the car has left.
What that is set became useless.

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:50.411
A hero and a villain who
can't even create a fight!

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.376
What to do Anna? (Brother) - Wait
there is a way, you wait and see.

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:56.707
Ravanan has snatched away Sita -

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.009
- and how come Raman
is not doing anything?

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.779
<i>My god!</i>

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.171
Shashi Anna great!
Got relaxed.

01:23:10.434 --> 01:23:12.971
Super Anna. Great.
Sir shall we leave?

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.077
So is there a real game
like this? I've seen only on movies.

01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:27.042
That was not required.

01:23:29.101 --> 01:23:31.445
So, tomorrow's wedding
shouldn't take place.

01:23:31.734 --> 01:23:35.341
Because of that Bro, should
go for U.K guy's bachelor party.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:41.680
As bro trusts Sumathi a lot and as
you doesn't know where Sumathi is now.

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:44.344
We should move carefully.

01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:51.137
Here sir.

01:23:52.067 --> 01:23:56.243
This for the bachelor party, its a
wedding gift for the U.K. guy.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.238
What is this about?

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:03.676
Right now running in theaters the
movie Bhaskarthe rascal's fake DVD.

01:24:04.367 --> 01:24:07.712
At the moment when this gift is
handed over as per the anti piracy act.

01:24:08.067 --> 01:24:12.106
Kerala police will arrest
U.K rascal and will be jailed.

01:24:13.734 --> 01:24:18.513
As for 2 days the court is on leave.
And as judge has gone to Himalayas.

01:24:18.734 --> 01:24:22.079
Won't get the bail.

At least let my daughter get that.

To remove the watch
and to muscle the fist -

01:33:46.234 --> 01:33:47.679

On that day the sun rose in Kerala
in a sorrowful manner than usual.

Are you standing here?
Go and sit inside.

Fool, keep an eye.
Not one put two eyes.

Marriage, house warming ceremony.
House warming ceremony, marriage.

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:08.577
Both should be shown
repeatedly one after the another.

Saying its a movie
against Endosulfan.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.449

To go for the tailors funeral
did the U.K guy consent?

01:38:21.234 --> 01:38:23.145
Did he consent?

01:38:23.334 --> 01:38:27.578
Aunty if tailor uncle is alive
what would be his age?

01:38:32.067 --> 01:38:33.273
Here tea.

Who is this?

01:38:52.734 --> 01:38:57.513
She is like this if at all getting some
time, she will start to tell stories.

01:39:00.367 --> 01:39:05.373
To design the coat for the prime
minister going to Ahmedabad.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:09.471

Let me see it,
let m e see it!

Like what you all thought
the tailor didn't die.

01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:46.375
Is it correct or wrong
tailor drinking Endosulfan?

01:39:46.601 --> 01:39:48.012
The participants in
the discussion are -

01:39:48.134 --> 01:39:51.479
Endosulfan company's Managing
director, then P.C George.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.409
And permanent discussion workers.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.601
What is received just now.

01:39:55.101 --> 01:39:58.480
The tailors union at Thayangiri
- Thankamma's state president.

01:39:58.667 --> 01:40:00.408
Has announced harthal
in Kerala tomorrow.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:01.670
Mangalasherri Neelakandan!

01:40:07.667 --> 01:40:11.444
Tailor needs immediate blood
as it is Bombay O +ve group.

01:40:11.667 --> 01:40:13.237
Within half an hour doner
should be here.

01:40:14.367 --> 01:40:18.008
Lucky that the hero took the
poison or else would have to say-

01:40:18.167 --> 01:40:19.976
- a very lengthy disease name.
Yes, yes.

01:40:21.267 --> 01:40:24.578
That is money order, no? Return it.
Not money order, its a letter for you.

01:40:25.767 --> 01:40:29.738
Whose is writing letter at these times
expect polit bureau and high command.

Friend, while coming to post
office to send the telegram.

01:40:35.634 --> 01:40:37.409
Came to know that is also stopped.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.980
Before banning me from this
movie, I've got a secret with me.

01:40:42.067 --> 01:40:46.277
The secret that tailor and Sumathi
has got Bombay O +ve blood group.

01:40:47.134 --> 01:40:49.740
By influencing the association
and if you can remove my ban.

01:40:50.067 --> 01:40:53.446
You expose this secret and
take full credit of that, my friend.

01:41:00.134 --> 01:41:02.410
Marriage, house warming
house warming, marriage.

01:41:03.001 --> 01:41:05.345
When cinema is moving out from
melodrama and moving to reality.

01:41:05.434 --> 01:41:06.674
Are you telling the tale like this?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.243
It is the writer who decides how the
tale should be told, its not the character.

01:41:10.434 --> 01:41:12.744
When the actors tell to rewrite the
story, you'll do it and then what is it?

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:16.106
That is cheap screen play writers
but we novelists won't do that.

01:41:16.368 --> 01:41:19.110
If Thakazhi had heard that. The
Karuthamma in Chem men.

01:41:19.267 --> 01:41:24.307
Like in Harikrishans, would have
wedded Palani and Pareekutty.

01:41:26.267 --> 01:41:29.305
I just can't stand this
nonsense of writers.

01:41:30.267 --> 01:41:33.612
In this movie where there is no life
and truth, again Sumathi is not there.

01:41:33.767 --> 01:41:37.237
How is that possible? When
Iwrite Sumathi should act, is it?

01:41:37.534 --> 01:41:40.310
That is only when the
character obeys the writer.

01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:42.308
What if I get out from the story?

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.140
What to get out without
the permission of writer?

01:41:46.534 --> 01:41:50.277
To commit suicide the writefs
permission is not required.

01:41:52.634 --> 01:41:57.634
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

01:42:17.667 --> 01:42:20.443
With the writer a fight
on the creative side.

01:42:21.667 --> 01:42:24.443
As a character that becomes
a martyr for the first time.

01:42:24.734 --> 01:42:27.146
Look, Sumathi ends here.

01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:04.205
Now did you understand
the greatness of writer?

01:43:04.367 --> 01:43:07.075
Will make the character
stand where they should be!

01:43:14.734 --> 01:43:17.681
Like this if the character comes
and says didn't like the story and -

01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:20.077
- says going out from the story,
how many Malayalam movies -

01:43:20.267 --> 01:43:22.679
- get released in an year?
5 or is it 6?

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:26.613
A character can do
nothing in a story.

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:30.441
Everything is decided
and executed by the writer.

01:43:30.567 --> 01:43:33.104
Why is that for?
Sumathi wait and see.

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.243

a friend who comes running.

Most dangerous than the poison -

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.737
- was the adulterated milk
from Tamil Nadu.

Its not something that can be
purchased by paying money or pound.

That one person should
feel to another person.

01:46:43.067 --> 01:46:48.016

love us, we should marry them.

money is also lost!

See Mr. Wood cutter. Did you think
my son who is lying, has got no money?

01:48:31.667 --> 01:48:33.669
The money orders which
he has returned -

01:48:34.067 --> 01:48:37.571
-that is enough to purchase
one dozen of Varikacherri mana.

I've built at Singapore -

only then give me 2 minutes time.

changed, now childrens wishes are important.

- may it'll be one of his greatest
contributions to Malayala cinema.

01:55:56.434 --> 01:55:59.347
Poor Ambujakshan, was not
lucky enough to be a Nair.

01:56:02.801 --> 01:56:04.644
Why are you not having
any respect towards me?

01:56:05.001 --> 01:56:07.311
Right now I'm not
only 'karayogam' president.

01:56:07.467 --> 01:56:10.539
The astrologer has told that I'll
become a parliament member.

01:56:11.434 --> 01:56:13.243
Move back boy!

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.046
Keep it there fellow!

01:56:19.401 --> 01:56:21.711
Must be proud on
getting a producer, no?

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:26.442
The astrologer has said.
What is up with my act?

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.478
Not like before, now I'm very
smart to say the dialogue and all.

01:56:32.734 --> 01:56:34.042
Just see this.

01:56:34.234 --> 01:56:37.704
I've checked all the houses
at Thonakkal panchayat.

01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:40.611
<i>New what is pending
is Rama“ Nair's house.</i>

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:42.737
How is this? How is this?

01:56:43.567 --> 01:56:45.774
Why Nairs clapping like this?

01:56:46.134 --> 01:56:48.671
There is a small meeting
of Mapranam Karayogam.

01:56:49.067 --> 01:56:52.014
<i>Take the which Rama“
Nair, no Krishna“ Nair.</i>

01:56:53.767 --> 01:56:55.678
Shall I leave Raman Nair?

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.505
Look, don't, don't!

01:57:00.767 --> 01:57:04.715
Cinema has moved from
melodrama and moved to reality.

01:57:05.101 --> 01:57:06.409
At that time"

01:57:07.267 --> 01:57:11.374
Lal Jose now you can talk. - Then
what again to say find some one else!

01:57:36.801 --> 01:57:46.654
"Oh! My dear, lotus beside you I
came as a beetle for the honey of love"

01:57:47.034 --> 01:57:51.540
"Love in the looks,
never to tell a lie"

01:57:51.701 --> 01:57:57.049
"Can the flower read the intention
of beetle without seeing?"

01:57:57.201 --> 01:57:59.044
"To say is in love"

01:57:59.134 --> 01:58:04.134
"Oh! My dear, lotus beside you I
came as a beetle for the honey of love"

01:58:22.301 --> 01:58:27.080
"ls life a game to entice
her in your play?"

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:32.649
"Enough, enough you don't hymn
like this you may leave that way"

01:58:37.234 --> 01:58:42.343
"Does it mean he is not handsome
Am Ia tom fool to the core?"

01:58:42.567 --> 01:58:45.070
"Is it because I became dark
skinned as black clouds?"

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.703
"What is the complaint?"

01:58:48.101 --> 01:58:52.641
"if you had come once. -What?
Could have covered you with gold"

01:58:53.101 --> 01:58:59.985
"Moonlight can you
come beside me?"

01:59:00.267 --> 01:59:05.267
Oh! My dear, lotus beside you I
came as a beetle for the honey of love"

01:59:10.567 --> 01:59:14.572
"Love in the looks,
never to tell a lie"

01:59:14.767 --> 01:59:20.080
"Can the flower read the intention
of beetle without seeing?"

01:59:20.267 --> 01:59:22.372
"To say is in love"

01:59:22.501 --> 01:59:27.501
Oh! My dear, lotus beside you I
came as a beetle for the honey of love"

01:59:33.134 --> 01:59:35.273
"No need of that, I'm going"

01:59:35.467 --> 01:59:38.243
"...for the honey of love"
