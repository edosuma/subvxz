<i>Previously on</i> Awkward...

00:02.225 --> 00:04.338
I'm not gonna hook up with Matty again
until we DTR.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.924
- What are you talking about?
- Define the relationship.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.217
Thanks again for ditching
out of the party with me.

00:09.383 --> 00:10.427
It was the best part of the night.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.595
Jenna, I like you.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.973
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to be in a relationship.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.451
In high school,
perception's everything.

00:26.576 --> 00:27.903
And being dropped off by a parent

00:28.069 --> 00:30.088
is like owning a rolling backpack

00:30.213 --> 00:32.824
or kissing your grandparent
on the mouth.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.326
Unsavory.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.396
In an environment where
everyone was playing the role

00:37.521 --> 00:38.622
of judge and jury,

00:38.789 --> 00:40.666
the only way to survive was to assert

00:40.832 --> 00:41.833
some kind of independence.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.001
All right, all right, all right.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.629
I'm getting out.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.756
You need to blend,
and then change that shirt.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.842
People are gonna think that
we can't afford nice things.

00:51.008 --> 00:53.178
Here.
And it's backless,

00:53.344 --> 00:55.514
so you don't even have to wear a bra.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.682
Nice. That'll be
interesting in gym

00:56.807 --> 00:57.808
when I have to run the mile.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.102
Jenna, it would not kill you
to take a risk.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.979
Be bold once in a while.

01:03.213 --> 01:03.980
My mother's perception
of being bold

01:04.214 --> 01:04.982
was free-boobin'.

01:05.248 --> 01:06.316
I'd had enough.

01:11.153 --> 01:13.615
If you're not into the shirt,

01:13.857 --> 01:15.734
at least take these so you look hip.

01:15.859 --> 01:16.868
They're fake.

01:17.127 --> 01:20.038
And they'll help you hide
your big unibrow.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.746
I wanted an excuse
to walk in together.

01:27.871 --> 01:30.849
But what I really needed
was an excuse to talk.

01:30.974 --> 01:33.885
Matty said he wasn't ready to be
in a relationship with anyone.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.492 --> 01:52.320
But maybe he just didn't want
to be in a relationship with me.

01:52.562 --> 01:55.365
And why would he?

01:55.599 --> 01:58.618
I was the suicide girl.

01:58.835 --> 02:00.245
[Computer keyboard tapping]

02:00.370 --> 02:02.539
[Gunshot]

02:02.773 --> 02:04.708
[Coach's whistle blowing]

02:04.941 --> 02:06.334
So the front said "Jenna lives,"

02:06.500 --> 02:07.853
and the back said "in tribute."

02:07.978 --> 02:09.687
That's clearly about me, right?

02:09.812 --> 02:11.590
As clear as the cold sore
on vera Herbert's face.

02:11.848 --> 02:13.675
I'd say it's oozingly obvi.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.694
I mean, crap
to the **** pile,

02:15.819 --> 02:17.554
I saw a girl get out
of Matty's truck.

02:17.821 --> 02:20.515
I mean, I think he's hooking up
with someone else.

02:20.757 --> 02:22.059
You're like a daytime
talk show.

02:22.325 --> 02:25.061
Except nobody's pregnant... yet.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.872
All this happened
before the bell even rang.

02:26.997 --> 02:30.025
What did I do to deserve
all this effed-up karma?

02:30.191 --> 02:31.910
Okay, act totally normal
and don't look now,

02:32.035 --> 02:33.653
but up on the right, she's
the one in the bleachers.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.684
- The whore!
- Yes, but don't stare!

02:38.809 --> 02:40.719
- Not looking.
- No idea who she is.

02:40.844 --> 02:42.412
- Ah, cramp.
- Me either.

02:42.679 --> 02:45.582
I think she's a junior.
And she kinda looks like you.

02:45.849 --> 02:47.959
Yeah, but prettier.
And cooler.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.896
With bigger boobs.
She's Jenna plus.

02:51.021 --> 02:52.714
No way.
She's Jenna minus!

02:52.956 --> 02:54.966
You don't taste like ashtray,
and you put out.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.676
She probably puts out too.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.221
But she's older, so the sex
is super dirty.

02:59.462 --> 03:00.972
What?

03:01.198 --> 03:04.042
I don't mean hot dirty,
I mean gross dirty.

03:04.167 --> 03:08.105
You know, like amateur porn.

03:08.338 --> 03:09.481
There's that guy
with the shirt.

03:09.706 --> 03:12.551
No wonder Matty wants to
keep his options open.

03:12.676 --> 03:13.985
It's hard to be seen
as girlfriend material

03:14.110 --> 03:15.362
with a lurker around.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.155
Your suicide stigma
is like the herps.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.865
Just when you think it's gone,
it comes back.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.631
So he gave someone a ride
in his truck.

03:26.756 --> 03:27.749
What's the big deal?

03:27.915 --> 03:29.459
You're getting all worked up
over a jaggoff.

03:29.693 --> 03:32.712
The girl's just some...

03:32.929 --> 03:34.548
Chick.

03:34.764 --> 03:37.634
You're right, I'm probably
just overreacting.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.555
It's a friendly hug.
Like this.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.765
See, totes friendly.

03:43.931 --> 03:45.308
There's nothing going on with this.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.477
Nothing below the neck.
Platonic.

03:47.711 --> 03:48.812
Hey. Yeah!

03:49.079 --> 03:51.289
You wish, cretin!

03:51.414 --> 03:53.066
It's not a friendly hug, is it?

03:53.283 --> 03:54.734
Surrender your pain
to the sugar.

03:55.018 --> 03:56.027
I'm fine.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.062
It's not like he's cheating on me.

03:57.187 --> 03:59.155
We're not together.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.908
He can get HPV from whoever he wants.

04:03.893 --> 04:05.078
See you later.

04:05.295 --> 04:06.671
I couldn't control Jenna plus

04:06.796 --> 04:08.748
from spreading her disease,

04:08.914 --> 04:10.458
but I could stop Kyle
from spreading his.

04:10.624 --> 04:12.627
You have to take that shirt off.

04:12.793 --> 04:14.713
No.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.548
Yes. You're glorifying
the suicide

04:16.673 --> 04:17.591
I didn't even commit.

04:17.807 --> 04:20.468
- "Jenna lives" is my band.
- Really?

04:20.634 --> 04:23.221
You have a band?

04:23.446 --> 04:24.556
What kind of music do you play?

04:24.781 --> 04:26.808
- It's not your style.
- Oh, and you know this

04:26.974 --> 04:28.560
because you're clearly
obsessed with me,

04:28.685 --> 04:29.895
so go change your shirt!

04:30.120 --> 04:32.230
I don't even know you.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.666
Plus, I know, like, a hundred Jennas.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.944
It says "in tribute."

04:38.161 --> 04:39.487
It's a <i>tribute</i> band.

04:42.298 --> 04:44.743
Maybe it was all in my head.

04:44.868 --> 04:45.994
I wanted to believe him.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.981
But everywhere I went...

04:50.106 --> 04:51.499
He was there!

05:04.787 --> 05:06.806
Would you stop following me!

05:07.023 --> 05:10.058
You're in the boys' bathroom.

05:11.493 --> 05:12.520
Hey.

05:12.686 --> 05:14.439
[Toilet flushes]

05:16.598 --> 05:18.443
I have a stalker.

05:18.668 --> 05:20.345
It's this guy named Kyle,
and he's following me around

05:20.470 --> 05:22.489
making light of
a very sensitive situation

05:22.706 --> 05:23.865
with a very <i>insensitive</i> T-shirt.

05:24.031 --> 05:25.350
I need you to make him stop.
I mean,

05:25.475 --> 05:27.202
isn't that, like, a rights
infringement or something?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.871
Are you sure you aren't being

05:30.037 --> 05:31.748
- a little bit paranoid?
- No!

05:31.982 --> 05:33.158
I see him everywhere.

05:33.283 --> 05:34.376
I mean, the shirt is pretty blatant.

05:34.542 --> 05:38.213
Maybe Kyle designed that shirt
as a fan.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.507
You know, maybe he wants
to be your dawg.

05:40.724 --> 05:41.508
My what?

05:41.725 --> 05:43.835
I know a little girl

05:43.960 --> 05:46.054
with a name that rhymes
with <i>Dalerie,</i>

05:46.220 --> 05:47.847
and she didn't have
any friends growing up.

05:48.064 --> 05:49.933
And it was very painful.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.277
Okay, are you suggesting
that this is his way

05:52.402 --> 05:53.228
of trying to be my friend?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.063
It's certainly possible.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.348
Really? 'Cause to me
it just seems like

05:56.473 --> 05:57.691
he'd rather cut off
a piece of my hair

05:57.907 --> 05:59.025
and wear it in a locket
around his neck.

05:59.242 --> 06:01.319
I think the worst thing
you can do right now

06:01.444 --> 06:02.529
is go to a crazy place.

06:02.746 --> 06:03.889
Okay, I'm tired of being seen

06:04.014 --> 06:04.864
as the girl who tried
to kill herself.

06:05.081 --> 06:06.116
I didn't.

06:06.349 --> 06:07.659
Kyle's shirt only reminds people

06:07.784 --> 06:08.994
that I'm still that girl.

06:09.219 --> 06:10.829
And then they don't want
to be seen with me,

06:11.054 --> 06:12.414
and then they don't want to date me.

06:12.689 --> 06:13.707
And his stupid T-shirt
is keeping me from moving on,

06:13.923 --> 06:15.667
not to mention,
it is in really bad taste.

06:15.892 --> 06:20.255
Oh, sweetie...

06:20.421 --> 06:23.425
I <i>thought</i> it was a fan shirt.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.885
You know what, I'll take it off.

06:26.051 --> 06:27.779
I'll take it off.
I don't need it.

06:27.904 --> 06:30.649
I don't care.
I'll just take it off.

06:30.774 --> 06:32.517
Never happened.

06:32.776 --> 06:34.227
Okay...

06:34.393 --> 06:36.521
Where were we?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.023
Oh, I don't know.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.275
Thanks for saving me
some tots, Kel.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.901
What would I do without you?

06:42.067 --> 06:44.062
McKibbs, nice hat trick
yesterday, man.

06:44.187 --> 06:46.298
Oh, thanks, dude.

06:46.423 --> 06:47.782
Oh, hey.
I didn't see you there.

06:47.948 --> 06:49.826
I'm so hungry.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.745
- You hungry?
- Starved.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.305
I could eat, like,
four sandwiches or something.

06:53.430 --> 06:55.790
Maybe some soup.
Mmm.

06:55.956 --> 06:57.876
Well, I think they have
chicken tortilla.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.087
So listen, I know we never
talked about it,

07:01.253 --> 07:03.248
but you know I didn't try
to kill myself, right?

07:03.373 --> 07:04.674
Misunderstanding.

07:04.841 --> 07:09.012
Okay.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.431
Uh...Jell-o?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.425
Mmm. Hello.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.186
Uh...

07:16.352 --> 07:17.562
Your mouth is saying okay,
but your eyes are saying,

07:17.728 --> 07:19.064
"save me from this lunatic."

07:19.230 --> 07:20.265
Which I totally understand
because I'm rambling

07:20.390 --> 07:21.399
and sounding like a whack job.

07:21.565 --> 07:23.443
But just so you know,
I was having a bad day,

07:23.609 --> 07:25.779
and I slipped-- I had an accident.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.572
Normal people have accidents.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.841
And that's exactly what I had
because I'm perfectly normal.

07:29.966 --> 07:32.744
[Forced laugh]

07:32.910 --> 07:34.829
Oh, what was I <i>saying?</i>

07:34.995 --> 07:36.289
You're--
you're totally normal.

07:36.455 --> 07:40.001
- Yes.
- I got it.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.252
- I'll see ya.
- Okay.

07:41.478 --> 07:44.923
Matty ditched me
to bring that chick a sandwich?

07:45.089 --> 07:46.825
I fooled around with the guy
at least eight times,

07:46.950 --> 07:50.053
and he never bought <i>me</i> a sandwich.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.263
He just bought her a sandwich.
We have to follow them.

07:52.429 --> 07:54.432
Who?

07:54.598 --> 07:56.059
Your face is all red,
and you have crazy eyes.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.394
Did you feed the rabid squirrels
in the quad?

07:58.561 --> 07:59.671
Listen, those shirts
are spreading,

07:59.796 --> 08:00.772
and I know Matty's seen them.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.007
Did you see those people
wearing them?

08:02.132 --> 08:03.399
I just need to find out
if they're together.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.901
You're going
to a dark place, J.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.511
Stay with us.

08:06.636 --> 08:08.571
I just need concrete proof
that they're dating.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.033
I knew it.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.202
You're totally cashing in
on my faux suicide attempt.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.454
That is illegal.
I could have you arrested!

08:16.620 --> 08:17.655
You're stalking me.
Admit it.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.124
I saw you at least
five times last period.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.500
I'm an office aid.

08:20.666 --> 08:24.129
Mm. Yeah?
Take the damn shirt off--now.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.380
You are ruining my life.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.757
Those are mine.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.135
- Take it off.
- No.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.178
Take it... off.

08:32.344 --> 08:33.179
- No.
- Fine.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.390
I will.
Just stop it, okay?

08:35.556 --> 08:36.765
People are getting the wrong idea.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
They think I'm crazy, okay?
Just stop it!

08:38.976 --> 08:40.520
Stop stalking me,
stop with these stupid T-shirts!

08:40.686 --> 08:42.679
Just stop it!
Just stop it! Just stop it!

08:42.804 --> 08:44.649
- Stop it!
- You're crazy.

08:53.782 --> 08:56.242
Does this really
warrant detention?

08:56.367 --> 08:57.676
If you were 18,

08:57.801 --> 08:59.812
it could warrant
some time in the slammer.

08:59.937 --> 09:02.081
Sorry I couldn't give you
special treatment.

09:02.206 --> 09:03.418
I mean, I could have,

09:03.584 --> 09:05.784
but there were so many witnesses.

09:05.909 --> 09:09.716
I see some new faces...

09:09.882 --> 09:11.551
Mixed in with the old.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.136
To the rookies--

09:13.302 --> 09:14.760
we're on the honor system here.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.263
Now, I'll be back to check on you,

09:17.388 --> 09:19.434
but you won't know when.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.269
So you best be on your best.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.439
Like busy little worker bees--

09:24.605 --> 09:25.732

09:25.898 --> 09:29.861
you will be working on your
homework honey pot,

09:30.027 --> 09:31.277
and I will be in my office

09:31.402 --> 09:33.823
attending to my piles

09:33.989 --> 09:35.783
and piles of work.

09:35.949 --> 09:39.162
Sometimes it feels like
I have detention too.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.701
We have exactly two hours.

09:55.826 --> 09:57.430
Starting now.
[Snaps]

10:01.016 --> 10:02.227
Two hours for, uh, for what?

10:02.393 --> 10:05.271
Valerie's nap.
We're heading to Giuseppe's.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.046
Guess Jenna plus
was a regular in detention.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.181
And the leader among the rebel herd.

10:09.306 --> 10:12.403
Maybe Matty thought
being bad... was good.

10:12.569 --> 10:15.156
Come on, newbie.

10:15.322 --> 10:17.659
From the small bird tattoo
on her ankle

10:17.825 --> 10:20.662
to the simple carmex she wore
instead of lip gloss,

10:20.828 --> 10:23.373
everything about Jenna plus was cool.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.208
Bitch.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.210
So what are you in
detention for, wonder boy?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.337
I was caught holding
the hose at the bonfire.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.048
- Kinky.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.806
And your crime, Hamilton?

10:33.931 --> 10:36.010
Oh, just a little...

10:38.637 --> 10:40.223
[Ahem] Misunderstanding.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.517
At lunch.
What are you in for?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.394
I'm a detention
rewards card member.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.851
Today I blew off history

10:45.976 --> 10:47.897
'cause I was on the phone having
a meltdown with this guy.

10:48.063 --> 10:49.355
Was she talking about Matty,

10:49.480 --> 10:51.693
or was I having a paranoia stroke?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.152
[Cell phone tune]

10:53.318 --> 10:54.904
Speak of the devil.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.585
What?

10:58.031 --> 10:59.993
No!

11:00.159 --> 11:01.536
What does that even mean?

11:03.426 --> 11:05.070
Can I bum a smoke?

11:05.195 --> 11:06.499
Sure.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.440
I wondered
if Matty liked smokers.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.712
And if so, could I fake a pro?

11:10.878 --> 11:11.963
Okay, then why don't you
take your sweet ass time

11:12.129 --> 11:13.506
to think about it and call me back?

11:17.240 --> 11:18.219
[Coughs]

11:19.636 --> 11:21.681
Everything okay?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.141
Yeah. It's just my ex.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.642
We've been on a break,

11:24.808 --> 11:27.312
and we're in the process
of maybe getting back together.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.161
Did that mean
I was Matty's rebound?

11:29.286 --> 11:30.982
Breaks are hard.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.775
Someone always hooks up
with another person,

11:32.941 --> 11:34.066
maybe even falls for them.

11:34.191 --> 11:35.486
Think he's into someone else?

11:35.652 --> 11:39.271
I thought so.
But now I'm not so sure.

11:39.396 --> 11:41.607
When we're together, it's...
It's amazing.

11:41.732 --> 11:42.910
It's like...

11:43.076 --> 11:45.621
The world falls away...
Then the next day,

11:45.787 --> 11:47.479
he's indifferent, he doesn't call me.

11:47.604 --> 11:49.314
He doesn't even want
to be seen with me.

11:49.439 --> 11:50.501
So started to wonder

11:50.774 --> 11:52.962
if maybe I'm imagining
all the good stuff.

11:53.128 --> 11:55.954
Jenna plus and I might have
been from different planets,

11:56.079 --> 11:58.426
but her Matty heartbreak
was the same.

[Cell phone tune]

12:01.386 --> 12:02.430
There it was.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.016
The answer I was chasing.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.366
I couldn't live in the safety
of denial anymore.

12:07.491 --> 12:09.979
She was with Matty.
He was with her.

12:10.145 --> 12:11.439
And I was with cancer.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.373
I'm gonna let him sweat it
for a little while.

12:14.498 --> 12:16.653
Thanks for listening.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.197
Are you okay?

12:19.363 --> 12:21.713
Whatever the misunderstanding
was today,

12:21.838 --> 12:23.159
it'll blow over.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.203
Nothing's ever as bad as it seems.

I'm gonna grab another pack.

As much as I wanted
to hate on Jenna plus,

12:32.334 --> 12:33.158
I couldn't.

12:33.283 --> 12:34.193
The bitch was decent.

12:34.461 --> 12:36.195
Maybe even sweet.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.020
And it made me
really want to kill myself.

you were a smoker.

Well, I hear lung cancer
does make your ass look huge.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.104
Well, I'm having a crappy day.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.939
Everyone thinks
I tried to kill myself,

12:53.064 --> 12:54.574
and there's a lame guy
selling T-shirts

12:54.699 --> 12:55.817
keeping the stupid story alive.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.236
I don't think
you tried to kill yourself.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.779
- Really?
- No.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.239
You're not the type.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.117
Well, unless you keep smoking.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.622
And there's a guy...

13:09.788 --> 13:11.165
Oh. Mysterious.

13:11.331 --> 13:12.500
I really like him,
but he has a girlfriend.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.835
Who is it?

13:14.001 --> 13:15.211
I can't say.

No comment.

Aw, come on.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.736
Does this guy even know
that you like him?

13:22.861 --> 13:25.012
I'd say it's pretty clear.

13:25.178 --> 13:28.141
I mean...
He's funny and he's cool,

13:28.266 --> 13:29.809
and everybody likes him,

13:29.975 --> 13:31.344
which is part of the problem.

13:31.469 --> 13:33.479
But I feel like I see
who he really is,

13:33.645 --> 13:34.447
and he gets me.

13:34.572 --> 13:36.232
Yeah.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.517
But we're not
on the same level,

13:37.642 --> 13:39.619
and he can never be
with a freak like me, so...

13:39.744 --> 13:40.945
It's kinda hopeless.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.890
Maybe you're misjudging
the situation,

13:44.015 --> 13:45.325
and this guy really does like you...

my two cents

you're on his radar.

lucky to be with you.

for the pity party.

15:46.557 --> 15:49.302

punishing too.

But nothing too harsh.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.771

without dessert?

to take more risks?

19:08.897 --> 19:11.358
â™ª â™ª

19:15.111 --> 19:17.615
Come sit with me!

19:24.374 --> 19:25.351
Cool specs.

19:25.476 --> 19:26.719
They're not real or anything.

19:26.844 --> 19:28.959
I like to wear them so that
people take me seriously.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.457
Funny, even Jenna plus
was concerned

19:31.582 --> 19:32.971
with how people perceived her.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.759
I didn't know you two
knew each other.

19:36.925 --> 19:37.760
Busted.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.387
We're detention buddies.

19:40.553 --> 19:42.598
I need ranch.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.810
You don't seem like the type
that would be in detention.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.562
Maybe you don't know
what type I am.

19:48.728 --> 19:51.110
So, um...

19:51.235 --> 19:52.900
How do you guys know each other?

19:53.066 --> 19:54.780
Who, Liv?

19:54.905 --> 19:58.948
She's kinda my girlfriend.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.407
In-law.

20:00.573 --> 20:03.088
She and my brother have been
off and on for a while.

20:03.213 --> 20:06.458
I don't really know what's going on.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.878
Weird.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.381
So you two kinda look alike.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.503
[Laughs]

20:17.628 --> 20:18.571
Yeah.

20:18.696 --> 20:21.220
Nah, she's way prettier
than me.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.975
It was our first lunch
together.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.045
And I realized it wasn't
my stigma or another girl

20:26.170 --> 20:28.347
keeping me from Matty.

20:28.472 --> 20:30.605
It was how I saw myself.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.819
Next on <i>Awkward.</i>

20:33.944 --> 20:34.753
You know this is
a charity <i>league.</i>

20:34.878 --> 20:36.527
Not a charity, right?

20:36.693 --> 20:37.823
We are gonna rock
the knick knackers.

20:37.948 --> 20:38.821
We are!

20:38.987 --> 20:41.991
You have to be cruel
to be kind.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.325
Both: Sadie wrote the letter!

20:43.491 --> 20:44.827
Do you think Matty
knows Jake kissed me?

20:44.993 --> 20:46.412
No way.
Guys don't talk.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.122
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton.
- What?

20:48.288 --> 20:49.331
