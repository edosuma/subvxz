WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:03.770
We've got a webpage which people
are accessing via the darknet.

00:03.819 --> 00:05.889
Two killers, different murder styles.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.130
One person is posting
a target for the other

00:08.179 --> 00:11.009
and the other is committing the murder.
They're playing a game.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.609
We are arresting you for the
possession and distribution

00:13.660 --> 00:15.369
of indecent images of a minor.

00:15.419 --> 00:17.692
Please, Ruth. Surely
we can sort this out.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.649
I don't think you should be
anywhere near this house.

00:20.699 --> 00:23.609
Why are people doing this to
me? I've done nothing wrong.

00:23.660 --> 00:26.890
Jenna Mawson's in danger and we
don't know that Kenny isn't involved.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.010
Hello? Police.
- Mitch?

00:29.219 --> 00:31.609
Leave us alone!
- I have an officer down.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.530
I'm struggling being here, knowing
that the guy who killed Mitch

00:34.579 --> 00:36.729
is in this building and I'm
doing nothing about it.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.729
There's still someone out there killing.
- I think I recognise him.

00:39.780 --> 00:42.210
I think it was the witness
at Michael Edgerton's murder.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.210
The one who gave us Steve's description.

00:44.259 --> 00:46.729
He's started to pick his own victims.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:37.900 --> 01:40.530
The officer Ian Mitchell was murdered

01:40.579 --> 01:42.979
whilst attending a house in Gorton.

01:45.740 --> 01:49.340
It was there that he lost his life
after suffering a knife attack.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.890
Questions are now being asked
as to why officers were sent

01:55.939 --> 02:00.489
to such a dangerous situation
so woefully ill-prepared.

02:00.540 --> 02:05.010
DC Ian Mitchell is survived
by a wife and two children.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.129
The family have asked to...

02:13.939 --> 02:16.860
DS Janet Scott is being hailed as a hero.

02:17.259 --> 02:20.449
It's believed she prevented the
death of a seven-year-old child,

02:20.500 --> 02:25.409
whilst reportedly trying to save
her colleague, DC Mitchell's life.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.930
All at a time when Manchester
Metropolitan Police

02:27.979 --> 02:30.009
are coming under increasing pressure

02:30.060 --> 02:32.250
over their handling of a series of murders

02:32.300 --> 02:36.620
connected to a gang of killers currently
stalking the streets of Manchester.

03:14.247 --> 03:15.247
Sorry. - Jesus!

03:15.274 --> 03:18.210
Sorry. Tim Canton. I'm a freelance
journalist. Really sorry.

03:18.235 --> 03:21.650
You shouldn't be here. You need
to speak to the press office.

03:21.699 --> 03:25.129
It sounds like you did something amazing yesterday.
- I'm sorry.

03:25.180 --> 03:28.650
Maybe you'd be happier talking
about your daughter Taisie?

03:28.699 --> 03:32.009
Arrested for distributing
indecent images of children?

03:32.060 --> 03:33.926
I just need a story.
- Drive, please.

03:33.953 --> 03:35.525
I don't care which one it is.

03:41.340 --> 03:45.170
We found where the sandwich wrapper
from Steve Dench's car came from.

03:45.219 --> 03:47.343
It's a small chain of
eight convenience stores.

03:47.368 --> 03:49.930
So he stopped at one of them on
the morning of Edgerton's murder.

03:49.956 --> 03:50.701
Yes.

03:50.728 --> 03:54.449
He could've disposed of the gloves or the
hoodie he wore when he killed Michael there.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.548
And the murder weapon.

03:55.574 --> 03:58.691
Get onto the shops, check the barcodes
and see which one he stopped at.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.689
Does he know the shopkeeper? Is
that where he accessed the website?

04:01.740 --> 04:04.689
Cos if we can find out how he did
that, and get his encryption codes,

04:04.740 --> 04:08.092
we don't just get him for Edgerton's murder but
we find out who he's playing this sick game with.

04:08.118 --> 04:09.211
On it.

04:09.259 --> 04:13.330
Mitch's brother's been in touch to confirm the
date of the funeral. It's a week tomorrow.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.050
We'll try to allow as many
people as possible to attend.

04:16.100 --> 04:20.730
We all need to be there.
- Pete, you will absolutely be there,

04:20.779 --> 04:24.170
but as we've got a critical
situation still live...

04:24.220 --> 04:28.129
still active, then there'll have to
be a ballot draw for the rest of us.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.319
Didn't take you long, did it?

04:32.300 --> 04:35.300
Looking to make this role
more permanent, are we?

04:39.579 --> 04:41.449
Briefing in ten.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
A word.

04:49.139 --> 04:51.129
You daft cow.

04:51.379 --> 04:55.610
You daft cow... that's
three words, not one.

04:55.659 --> 04:57.810
Are you about to tell me off?

04:57.860 --> 04:59.930
Please don't say you're
about to tell me off.

04:59.980 --> 05:04.089
Then please don't tell me you went round to
Sam's mum's and asked her to drop the charges.

05:04.139 --> 05:07.129
She's made a complaint to the
Serious Sexual Offences Unit.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.783
They've asked me to offer you
some "management advice".

05:09.810 --> 05:11.970
I really don't want to
say this but I have to.

05:12.019 --> 05:15.250
If you take any more steps to get Ruth
or Sam to change their statements,

05:15.300 --> 05:18.850
you'll be subject to a disciplinary investigation.
- How am I guilty now?

05:18.899 --> 05:20.610
Why aren't they trying to help us?

05:20.660 --> 05:23.930
Certainly gives you a different
perspective being on the other side.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.009
You know that you're going a little
bit bad-ass crackers, don't you?

05:27.060 --> 05:31.860
Carry on like this and you and Taisie'll be
occupying a family room at Holloway Prison.

05:33.899 --> 05:35.889
This isn't you, Janet.

05:35.939 --> 05:38.970
You've always taught me that we
have to be by-the-book perfect.

05:39.019 --> 05:41.449
It's the only way that we
can do this job and survive.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.610
Yeah, and over the years you've taught me

05:43.659 --> 05:46.000
that sometimes that isn't enough.

05:54.019 --> 05:58.009
Face shots of our new suspect at the neo-Nazi
rally will be checked through VIPER.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.810
We need to show these to Jenna Mawson.

05:59.860 --> 06:04.089
She's the only person that's been nominated
and survived. She may be able to identify him.

06:04.139 --> 06:08.170
We didn't get a clear shot of the person
who murdered Lukasz Balusek by the canal,

06:08.220 --> 06:12.420
but we got footage of
them walking together.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.093
Is it possible to use gait analysis.... matching
how he walks... to prove it's the same bloke?

06:19.119 --> 06:20.170
Yeah, maybe.

06:20.197 --> 06:24.769
But we haven't managed to pick this guy up entering
the city on the day of the neo-Nazi rally.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.730
And our trail runs cold on Lever Street,

06:26.779 --> 06:28.410
as he leaves the murder scene.

06:28.459 --> 06:31.903
There's loads of car parks in the Northern
Quarter. They'll be covered with cameras.

06:31.928 --> 06:33.050
Good, get onto it.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.730
What if we didn't miss his exit from
the city centre because he didn't leave?

06:36.779 --> 06:38.370
Because he lives or works there?

06:38.420 --> 06:41.449
Pete, Anna, I want you to take
an image as discreetly as possible

06:41.500 --> 06:43.769
round the shops and bars
of the Northern Quarter,

06:43.819 --> 06:47.050
see if anyone can give this guy a name.
- Why not put out a full media alert?

06:47.100 --> 06:51.250
The last thing I want is him going to ground before
we've exhausted every other avenue of enquiry.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.170
Should we alert the public?

06:53.220 --> 06:56.290
We're talking about a serial
killer who is going to kill again.

06:56.340 --> 07:00.449
The investigation has definitely
accelerated the frequency of the attacks.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.569
The first murders were months, years
apart. We've had two in the last week.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.970
It's highly likely he will
attack again, and soon.

07:07.019 --> 07:09.730
All the more reason to keep
our hands close to our chest.

07:09.779 --> 07:13.290
They'd have spent months preparing those
early murders, tracking their victims,

07:13.339 --> 07:16.730
making sure every little detail was in
place. Right now they're lashing out,

07:16.779 --> 07:20.970
they're ill-prepared, getting sloppy, making
mistakes and that is how we're going to catch them.

07:21.019 --> 07:23.514
So this is the same guy who
led us to Steve Dench?

07:23.540 --> 07:25.129
Yes, it's definitely the man

07:25.180 --> 07:27.613
that gave me the statement
at Michael Edgerton's murder.

07:27.639 --> 07:28.810
And now he's a suspect?

07:28.860 --> 07:32.170
Then why give us a witness statement?
- He's trying to frame Steve Dench?

07:32.220 --> 07:34.009
So that makes Steve Dench innocent?

07:34.060 --> 07:35.769
Not necessarily.

07:35.819 --> 07:38.050
This is a game with two people involved.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.976
Maybe this guy just got
sick of playing with Steve.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.250
If Steve's guilty.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.889
I wouldn't be surprised if
he'd set up other websites,

07:44.939 --> 07:47.050
grooming other people to play the game.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.569
Steve's no longer necessary.
- But surely by leading us to Steve,

07:50.620 --> 07:52.730
he's risking getting caught himself.

07:52.779 --> 07:54.730
He's already shown his face to Anna.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.610
He'd love that. The cheek of it.

07:56.659 --> 07:59.610
He wouldn't think in a million
years we'd be able to catch him.

07:59.659 --> 08:02.329
But how can he be sure
Steve won't lead us to him?

08:02.379 --> 08:05.410
Unless he knows that Steve can't
because we have no evidence

08:05.459 --> 08:08.250
that these people have ever met
before except on the website.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.370
We've searched for the username
Scareit4me on other websites.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.490
We found it appearing about seven
years ago on a snuff porn site,

08:14.540 --> 08:17.170
who was talking to someone
called mansupermanch85.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.970
At that point the conversations aren't
encrypted. They've nothing really to hide.

08:21.019 --> 08:22.930
They're just commenting on images.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.529
What we can see is one of
them grooming the other,

08:25.579 --> 08:29.449
encouraging him to consider how exciting
it must be to commit these murders.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.769
Then the more dominant of the two
suggests they set up their own website.

08:32.820 --> 08:35.610
They start encrypting and we
can't see what they're saying.

08:35.659 --> 08:37.610
Let's keep the pressure up on Steve Dench.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.330
Question his wife, Joanne,
and Marion Coleman.

08:40.379 --> 08:45.450
If he is having an affair with Marion,
then his wife might not be so protective.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.690
Marion said that she met
Steve at 8am that morning.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.409
She says she sees him
most mornings at that time.

08:51.460 --> 08:54.929
I just wanted to double check
that fits with your statement

08:54.980 --> 08:58.179
that on the morning in question
you saw Steve leave at 7am?

09:01.220 --> 09:03.289
I normally hear him leave at that time.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.090
They sleep in separate beds.

09:05.139 --> 09:07.889
So she didn't see or
hear him that morning.

09:07.940 --> 09:11.409
So he could've left the house in
time to commit Edgerton's murder?

09:11.460 --> 09:13.529
Well, there goes his alibi.

09:13.580 --> 09:17.250
Get him back in before Marion or
Joanne can give him any information.

09:17.299 --> 09:19.370
I'll speak to Jenna Mawson.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.929
Do you recognise this man?

09:26.980 --> 09:30.330
Is that one of the men after me?

09:30.379 --> 09:32.850
We think so.
- You think?

09:32.899 --> 09:35.970
You don't know?
- Jenna, you are safe here. I promise you.

09:36.019 --> 09:38.360
Have you made that promise before?

09:40.700 --> 09:42.610
Look, here's my number.

09:42.659 --> 09:44.370
Have you?

09:44.419 --> 09:46.419
How many times?

09:48.059 --> 09:50.169
Have you always managed to keep it?

09:50.220 --> 09:53.889
There is someone outside
this flat 24 hours a day.

09:53.940 --> 09:57.009
And there is a huge amount of
people out there searching for him.

09:57.059 --> 09:59.970
And all of you still haven't
been able to stop him.

10:00.019 --> 10:02.889
I'm trapped here on my own.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.630
He knows where I live and I
don't know if the person

10:05.657 --> 10:08.169
knocking on my door is
here to protect me or not.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.899
How can you promise me that I'll be safe?

10:13.460 --> 10:15.460
You're nowhere with this.

10:21.940 --> 10:24.450
Do you think it's time to hand this over?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.378
What?

10:26.403 --> 10:27.432
No. Why?

10:27.457 --> 10:30.009
You're just setting out on
your sergeant's career...

10:30.059 --> 10:32.850
Do you really want to put
yourself in the firing line?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.711
I thought I had
everyone's backing?

10:34.736 --> 10:37.929
You have... Well, you did have,
but now the shit's hitting.

10:37.980 --> 10:40.809
The top ranks are coming under a
lot of pressure to get results

10:40.860 --> 10:44.009
and if they can't get them, the
next best thing's a scapegoat.

10:44.059 --> 10:46.529
You think this is your moment to shine

10:46.580 --> 10:50.049
but I think if you hold onto
this it could be very damaging.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.649
It would be more damaging to walk away
and let someone else clear this mess up.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.490
I want to see this through.

10:57.539 --> 11:00.490
I just need you to trust me.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.289
What?
- Come home, Rachel!

11:10.340 --> 11:12.340
He's been here.

11:50.539 --> 11:53.690
What are you going to do? Challenge
them to a game of rounders?

11:53.740 --> 11:55.809
Don't you dare laugh at me!

12:01.179 --> 12:03.370
Thank God the kids didn't see it.

12:03.419 --> 12:06.769
Callum's at his dad's and
Holly's at the Arndale.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.690
You don't know they didn't do it.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.610
We need to call the police.

12:10.659 --> 12:11.817
They're here.

12:11.844 --> 12:15.291
Not you. The proper ones,
with sniffer dogs and guns.

12:15.340 --> 12:19.179
Oh, great. Someone else who doesn't
think I'm capable of doing my job!

12:20.019 --> 12:24.409
Look, if you were a kid while
all this was kicking off,

12:24.460 --> 12:28.649
and you knew that a copper lived down the end
of the street, what would you do? Come on.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.210
Yeah, all right.

12:31.259 --> 12:35.529
I'd be drawing bloody great big chalk
stars on their wall, of course I would.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.330
Someone would've been in touch if anything
had been posted online and I was in danger,

12:39.379 --> 12:41.450
which they haven't, so
there isn't and I'm not.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.769
Ring someone at least.
- I don't need to. Why don't you understand

12:44.820 --> 12:46.960
that I'm the person you ring?

12:48.340 --> 12:51.570
My bosses already want
to chuck me off the case.

12:51.620 --> 12:55.649
How's it going to look if I dial 999 and say,
"Someone's not playing down their own end,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.769
someone's drawing chalk stars on my gate".

12:57.820 --> 13:00.409
So, no, I'm not ringing anyone.
- Do it for the baby.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.049
Oh, and you can pack that in.

13:03.100 --> 13:07.379
I haven't even checked to see
if it's still there today.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.690
It's like you're willing this one away

13:11.740 --> 13:14.289
so you don't have to grieve its loss.

13:14.340 --> 13:17.330
Stop treating life like it doesn't matter.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.850
I spend my days protecting people's lives.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.850
Start with your own.

13:21.899 --> 13:26.090
Worry about the rest when you
know you're safe yourself.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.379
It's OK to be scared of stuff.

13:31.587 --> 13:33.697
Stars, babies...

13:33.724 --> 13:36.713
If you just stop talking right now

13:36.740 --> 13:39.649
I will call someone...

13:39.700 --> 13:43.490
as soon as you've gone.
- Where am I going? A safehouse?

13:43.539 --> 13:46.250
What about the kids? They've got school.

13:46.299 --> 13:49.850
No, back home. Back to Tony.

13:49.899 --> 13:53.500
I know you've been talking these
last few of days. I've heard you.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.929
I do love him. I do.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.610
And he's finally admitted
he's a donkey-faced tosser

14:02.659 --> 14:06.610
when he's had a drink.
- You should write Valentines cards.

14:06.659 --> 14:09.289
Well, you're not staying
here on your own tonight.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.090
You can stay at ours.

14:11.139 --> 14:14.929
I don't think the reconciliation would
last that long if you turned up with me.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.980
Can you stay at Janet's?

14:22.580 --> 14:26.289
There's definitely a
job going at your place?

14:26.340 --> 14:29.049
Could you put a word in?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
Great.

14:34.259 --> 14:37.460
I'll get onto the Met's website
and get an application in.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.059
Still hanging in there, buddy.

14:48.139 --> 14:50.129
No! No, no, no, no!

14:50.179 --> 14:52.179
Oh. Urgh.

15:01.899 --> 15:04.570
We've been trying to call you.
- Sorry. Sorry.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.490
I dropped my phone down the loo.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.210
What happened?
- You've missed the chippy run.

15:10.259 --> 15:12.009
We got you sausage and mushy peas.

15:12.059 --> 15:14.490
The barcodes narrowed down
the sandwich wrappers

15:14.539 --> 15:17.889
to two possible stores. Neither are
between Steve's house and the gym.

15:17.940 --> 15:19.529
So we know he took a detour.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.529
One of them is between the Michael
Edgerton murder scene and the gym.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.649
Get me CCTV from the shop on that morning

15:24.700 --> 15:27.129
and I want a POLSA search
of the area around the shop.

15:27.155 --> 15:29.547
We're looking for that black
hoodie and his murder weapon.

15:29.572 --> 15:30.573
Right.

15:33.547 --> 15:34.639
Hey.

15:35.024 --> 15:36.681
You all right?

15:36.706 --> 15:41.649
Hm... I've just had a bit
of nonsense with our Alison.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.409
Don't stop eating for me.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.769
I had some proper weird cravings.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.210
Steve's downstairs ready for interview.

15:49.259 --> 15:50.889
Are you prepped?
- Um, yeah.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.570
There's just a couple of
things I wanted to run by you.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.730
Steve might not have a connection
to the canal victim, Lukasz Balusek.

15:57.779 --> 15:59.850
But the woman he's having
an affair with did.

15:59.899 --> 16:03.129
Marion Coleman works at the
university in the loans department.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.169
She said that Balusek
gave her a ton of grief

16:06.220 --> 16:08.570
when they turned down his
hardship application.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.809
We're getting closer. Did she
recognise any of the other victims?

16:11.860 --> 16:13.370
No. And she's not sure

16:13.419 --> 16:16.529
but she thinks she remembers
telling Steve about the arguments.

16:16.580 --> 16:19.049
So now we do have a connection.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.889
Cafe Come Home in the Northern Quarter.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.370
They said our suspect
comes in most mornings,

16:24.419 --> 16:27.289
first thing, for a double shot of espresso.
- Name?

16:27.340 --> 16:30.090
No, but they did say he
pays using a Smart watch.

16:30.139 --> 16:33.730
So I'm waiting for details from their
payments system, see who pays that way.

16:33.779 --> 16:37.019
Or we could just make sure we're
there when he next comes in.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.462
Did we get Steve back in
before Joanne and Marion left?

16:41.489 --> 16:42.393
Yes.

16:42.525 --> 16:44.820
How long do you reckon his
solicitor will let you speak to him

16:44.846 --> 16:46.558
before she insists on
rest for the night?

16:46.585 --> 16:49.210
I'll play it to our advantage.
I'm going to go in and say...

16:49.259 --> 16:51.129
We've spoken to Marion Coleman

16:51.179 --> 16:53.529
and, as a result, we have new evidence

16:53.580 --> 16:55.690
pertaining to Michael Edgerton's murder.

16:55.740 --> 16:59.570
It's very late. And once again I'd like to
direct you to the fact that my client...

16:59.620 --> 17:01.850
Has made a written statement.
- Yes, that's fine.

17:01.899 --> 17:05.740
And you're right, it's very late so
I think that's enough for tonight.

17:07.339 --> 17:11.049
So I drop that little bombshell,
then we bed him down for the night

17:11.098 --> 17:13.608
with no-one to talk to but
the voices in his head,

17:13.660 --> 17:15.730
asking those questions
about what we know.

17:15.779 --> 17:18.289
Hard ball. That's not very you.

17:18.339 --> 17:21.529
No, it didn't used to be.

17:21.579 --> 17:24.450
Well, let's give it a go
and see what happens.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.450
Hi, can we speak to Taisie Scott, please?

17:42.500 --> 17:43.819
Why are they here at this time?

17:43.846 --> 17:46.170
They have to. It's part of
Taisie's bail conditions.

17:46.220 --> 17:47.809
At three in the morning?

17:47.859 --> 17:51.900
They need to make sure nobody can
accuse me of getting special treatment.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.339
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.289
Mum!
- Where did you get this?

18:02.339 --> 18:04.329
Mel gave it me.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.130
She got an upgrade.

18:06.180 --> 18:09.289
No chance! No phones until this is over

18:09.339 --> 18:12.890
and then you're having yoghurt
cartons and a piece of string!

18:20.900 --> 18:23.210
Papa Romeo One to Papa Romeo 39.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.769
Covert ops are in place. Over.

18:25.819 --> 18:29.009
I can't take Pete seriously when
he calls himself Papa Romeo One.

18:29.059 --> 18:32.410
Papa Romeo 39 to Papa Romeo
One. Understood. Over.

18:32.460 --> 18:37.089
Have you got your phone fixed yet? If your SIM'll
fit, I've got a spare one you can use. Over.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.009
It's got rainbow stickers on it.

18:39.059 --> 18:42.009
I'm just seeing if mine's dried out.

18:42.059 --> 18:45.660
I've had it in the airing
cupboard all night. Over.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.319
'Thank God the kids didn't see it.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.250
Callum's at his dad's and
Holly's at the Arndale.'

19:13.299 --> 19:15.700
'You don't know they didn't do it.'

19:23.180 --> 19:24.930
We've got a someone.

19:24.980 --> 19:28.329
Papa Romeo Two. I've got eyes on him
and can confirm it's our suspect. Over.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.180
Papa Romeo 39. Let's try and pick him
up before he gets into that cafe.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.809
We're arresting you on
suspicion of murder.

19:38.859 --> 19:41.730
We've got him.
- It may harm your defence...

19:51.859 --> 19:55.210
I want co-ordinate them being in
the custody area at the same time.

19:55.259 --> 19:58.490
I want to get those first
reactions of seeing each other.

19:58.539 --> 20:01.140
See if they recognise each other or not.

20:06.460 --> 20:09.500
If I were you I would have a
word with him and explain...

20:09.619 --> 20:12.859
Anna, you found him, so you're up.

20:15.140 --> 20:17.410
So you were at the neo-Nazi rally?

20:17.460 --> 20:19.809
Yes, I was there, but
it's not what you think.

20:19.859 --> 20:24.569
It's just like-minded people trying to protect
our country and the people born here.

20:24.619 --> 20:26.619
A bit like you, I guess.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.130
OK.

20:30.180 --> 20:34.210
Well, I was wondering if you could
look at this footage for me?

20:34.259 --> 20:38.329
I'm now showing Craig
Widnes video exhibit RB12.

20:38.380 --> 20:42.690
I'd like to draw your attention to
two specific moments on the film.

20:52.180 --> 20:55.049
I've frozen the footage
at 1 hour 36 minutes.

20:56.019 --> 20:58.359
Can you confirm that this is you?

21:03.579 --> 21:06.130
Yes. I think you might be right.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.809
Brilliant.

21:07.859 --> 21:11.250
Great. Would you mind talking
me through what you're doing?

21:11.299 --> 21:15.170
In the first clip I'm being
bounced about by some idiots.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.930
It was getting a bit rowdy for me.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.049
That's why I decided to leave the rally.

21:19.099 --> 21:22.220
And in the second clip, this
clip, I'm tying my shoe lace.

21:23.740 --> 21:28.049
I'm now showing Craig
Widnes photo exhibit RB16.

21:28.099 --> 21:30.049
There was a chalk star drawn

21:30.099 --> 21:32.410
at the place where you were kneeling.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.210
What can you tell us about it?

21:34.259 --> 21:37.329
I've seen these in the news,
but I didn't notice it

21:37.380 --> 21:39.930
when I was tying my lace.
- So you didn't draw it?

21:39.980 --> 21:41.769
Keep the questions open-ended.

21:41.819 --> 21:42.577
No.

21:42.604 --> 21:44.851
I'd like to ask you about
the statement you gave me

21:44.900 --> 21:46.970
on the morning of Michael
Edgerton's murder.

21:47.019 --> 21:48.849
What? She needs to stick with the rally.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.529
I think you must be mistaken.
We haven't met, have we?

21:51.579 --> 21:55.289
Yes, you gave me the statement
about seeing a man running away.

21:55.339 --> 21:58.329
I don't think so. Are you 100% positive?

21:58.380 --> 21:59.919
Yes.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.559
She doesn't sound so certain.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.289
She needs to slow this down,
get back on track, take control.

22:05.339 --> 22:08.539
I really don't think so. Did I
give you my name and address?

22:10.140 --> 22:12.930
No.
- Sign a statement?

22:12.980 --> 22:15.849
No.
- So there's nothing to say it was definitely me?

22:15.900 --> 22:18.970
Oh, shit. She wasn't ready for this.

22:19.019 --> 22:21.890
She needs to stop the
interview and re-group.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.867
It was me.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.730
At the rally. I admit I was there.

22:29.779 --> 22:32.210
And I can understand why
you'd be offended by that.

22:32.259 --> 22:35.210
But my political beliefs shouldn't
affect how I'm treated.

22:35.259 --> 22:38.660
You're relying on CCTV images
which are poor to say the least.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.049
Have you identified everyone
else in that footage?

22:43.099 --> 22:45.970
Have you eliminated them
from your enquiries?

22:54.980 --> 22:58.819
"I left at 7am to drive to the
gym. I feel that the manner... ."

22:58.846 --> 23:02.130
As I mentioned last night,
we spoke to Marion Coleman

23:02.180 --> 23:06.130
and she confirmed she'd seen you at the
gym, as per your written statement.

23:06.180 --> 23:09.410
We asked her how certain she
was it was you. She was.

23:09.460 --> 23:12.500
And she was very forthcoming
about your relationship.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.769
How would you describe your
relationship with Marion Coleman?

23:19.819 --> 23:23.329
I don't think...
- Hey.

23:23.380 --> 23:25.769
It's just that if you are
having an affair with her,

23:25.819 --> 23:28.559
it makes her a somewhat
unreliable witness.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.769
So, we wanted to be thorough,

23:32.819 --> 23:34.650
and as you're not answering questions

23:34.700 --> 23:36.369
we went back to your wife Joanne.

23:36.420 --> 23:38.730
I explained to her why
Marion is unreliable

23:38.779 --> 23:41.250
and asked her if she could
give us more details

23:41.299 --> 23:43.049
about the morning in question.

23:43.099 --> 23:46.410
What do you think she said when
we explained to her about Marion?

23:46.460 --> 23:48.388
What she said is...

23:48.414 --> 23:51.369
That she didn't actually
see you leave the house

23:51.420 --> 23:55.220
on the morning of Michael Edgerton's murder.
- OK... - Yeah, all right.

23:57.140 --> 23:59.339
I should've told you straight.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.140
I left earlier and it was my car
parked where you said I was.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.880
I was meeting a bloke about
buying some steroids.

24:10.212 --> 24:12.923
That's why I never told you.

24:13.099 --> 24:14.769
I was scared of getting in trouble.

24:14.819 --> 24:17.049
The purchase of steroids isn't illegal.

24:17.099 --> 24:19.890
The supply of them is, so
you've no need to worry.

24:19.940 --> 24:22.450
Can you tell me the name
of the person you met?

24:22.500 --> 24:25.250
I don't know his name. He's a
friend of a bloke at the gym.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.210
I was just told to meet him there.

24:27.259 --> 24:30.410
OK. Well, can you tell me the
name of the person at the gym?

24:30.460 --> 24:33.329
Then we can check him out
and hopefully eliminate you

24:33.380 --> 24:35.747
from this particular line of enquiry.

24:35.772 --> 24:37.883
John McEnroe.
- No. - Yeah.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.569
First name off his lips.
You could see him crumbling

24:40.619 --> 24:44.049
as soon as he'd said it, but
at least we've got him talking.

24:44.099 --> 24:46.609
Hello.
- Your sandwich wrapper's paid off.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.569
We've found the hoodie and the gloves.

24:48.619 --> 24:52.250
They were dumped inside a clothes
recycling unit near the convenience store.

24:52.299 --> 24:54.170
Pretty bloody clever if you ask me.

24:54.220 --> 24:57.089
Not as clever as he thinks he was
because we still found them.

24:57.140 --> 25:01.529
I want them fast-tracked through
forensics, and I mean proper fast-tracked.

25:01.579 --> 25:04.089
Er...

25:04.140 --> 25:08.538
Craig Widnes' solicitor is kicking off. He wants
to speak to the PACE inspector about release.

25:08.564 --> 25:11.673
Is there any chance you could've been
wrong about him being at the crime scene?

25:11.699 --> 25:12.651
No.

25:12.700 --> 25:15.039
None at all?
- I'm pretty sure.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.329
So, why is he being unduly singled out?

25:19.380 --> 25:22.369
Have you TIE'd any of the
other people from the footage?

25:22.420 --> 25:24.849
No, because we've only just located him.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.289
Has he co-operated?

25:27.339 --> 25:29.089
Yes.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.849
Sorry.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.130
I consider it proportionate to
release your client on bail...

25:34.180 --> 25:37.650
You've got to be joking.
- .. whilst further enquiries are carried out.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.849
The Custody Sergeant will deal with bail.

25:39.900 --> 25:43.730
Well, I've no doubt we'll be
speaking to you again very soon.

25:43.779 --> 25:45.650
She's a charmer.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.039
She should write Valentines cards.

26:13.660 --> 26:18.170
'He's finally admitted that he's a
donkey-faced tosser when he's had a drink.'

26:18.220 --> 26:20.690
'You should write Valentines cards.'

26:25.740 --> 26:28.529
'Do it for the baby.'
- 'Oh, and you can pack that in.

26:28.579 --> 26:34.009
I haven't even checked to see
if it's still there today.'

26:34.059 --> 26:36.400
Right, I've heard enough, thanks.

26:37.660 --> 26:41.450
Um... so when I first heard it I
thought I'd recorded it myself.

26:41.500 --> 26:45.130
But after what Craig said...

26:45.180 --> 26:47.289
could he have done it somehow?

26:47.339 --> 26:50.490
Yeah. You've been hacked.

26:50.539 --> 26:52.329
There was one similar last year.

26:52.380 --> 26:54.829
Turns on your phone's
microphone without you knowing.

26:54.855 --> 26:56.009
Somebody can do that?

26:56.059 --> 26:58.410
Yeah, it could even be
activated by a dodgy text.

26:58.460 --> 27:01.009
People sign that right
away, legally, every day.

27:01.059 --> 27:05.049
You ever read the T's and C's on all those
messaging and phone apps you download?

27:05.099 --> 27:06.099
No.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.673
Nobody does. When you click 'agree' you've
got no idea what you're actually agreeing to.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.970
Loads of them say they can access your information,
your microphones, without you knowing.

27:14.019 --> 27:16.490
This hack just does it
without you ticking the box.

27:16.539 --> 27:18.529
I don't like this one bit.

27:18.579 --> 27:22.548
We need Craig picking up, soon as.
- Yep. - Could you give us a minute?

27:28.500 --> 27:31.730
Yesterday you begged me to trust you.

27:31.779 --> 27:34.650
That same day you were
keeping information from me

27:34.700 --> 27:37.849
that could not only jeopardise the
case but put your life in danger.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.369
I thought I'd recorded it by mistake.
- I'm not talking about the recordings.

27:41.420 --> 27:45.730
I'm talking about the star outside your house,
that you're pregnant and haven't disclosed it.

27:45.779 --> 27:49.690
If I'd thought that the star was a credible
threat, I'd have come straight to you.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.880
That's not your call to make.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.769
I think for the benefit of the case

27:56.819 --> 27:59.410
and for the safety of yourself
and your unborn child,

27:59.460 --> 28:02.650
I think I have no other choice than to take you off the case.
- No.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.930
You know what this has cost.
Take me away from this

28:04.980 --> 28:06.849
and you're as good as
saying I've failed.

28:06.900 --> 28:11.539
You said, "Don't throw away your career",
and you want to sign its death warrant. No.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.650
I'm going to London.

28:13.700 --> 28:16.369
You can fuck Manchester
and forget the baby!

28:16.420 --> 28:19.730
And they can stick their bastard job!
- Do you want me to go?

28:19.779 --> 28:22.329
All she said was you need
to go home and calm down

28:22.380 --> 28:25.009
while she thinks about it.
- I don't need to calm down.

28:25.059 --> 28:27.529
No, you've got Dalai Llama
written all over you.

28:27.579 --> 28:29.769
Aaarrrgghhhh!

28:29.819 --> 28:31.569
Better?
- No.

28:31.619 --> 28:33.890
Give me a minute. Aaaarrgghhhh!

28:35.660 --> 28:38.609
I hate this shitty place.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.170
My girlfriend wants me to
consider quitting as well.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.730
I'm not quitting. I'm escaping.
- Why?

28:43.779 --> 28:46.769
I know! I keep telling her,
I'm a Chinese lesbian.

28:46.819 --> 28:49.890
Lop my leg off and I'll be
superintendent by the end of the year!

28:49.940 --> 28:53.890
After Mitch's death, she's wondering
if this is the right job to do.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.930
Doing this case, I'm wondering
if she might be right.

28:56.980 --> 28:59.569
And let the blokes do
all the dirty work?

28:59.619 --> 29:01.410
You can't let them scare you away.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.210
Have you heard her?

29:03.259 --> 29:05.569
Have the last 20 years meant nothing?!

29:05.619 --> 29:08.289
Do you know what people
like Gill, Dodson and me

29:08.339 --> 29:12.130
have had to put up with so you
can be here, being brilliant?

29:12.180 --> 29:14.650
We're not going to be around forever!

29:48.460 --> 29:51.980
They're bringing Craig Widnes
back in to ask him about my phone.

29:53.180 --> 29:55.730
Dodson doesn't think I
should stay at mine tonight,

29:55.779 --> 29:57.490
so... er... can I... um...?

29:57.539 --> 29:59.539
Course.

30:01.220 --> 30:03.289
I'm going to get my scan.

30:03.339 --> 30:07.289
Wherever I end up, I'm going
to need my MATB1 certificate.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.250
But you've decided to have the baby?

30:09.299 --> 30:11.250
No.

30:11.299 --> 30:14.460
No, um... Dodson insisted for procedure.

30:17.339 --> 30:19.250
I've got Anna trying to find a connection

30:19.299 --> 30:22.210
between Widnes and any of the victims.

30:22.259 --> 30:24.049
So what's your plan for Steve?

30:24.099 --> 30:26.690
He still thinks he can
talk his way out of this,

30:26.740 --> 30:29.329
but he hasn't accounted
for all of his movements

30:29.380 --> 30:31.089
on the day of the murder.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.849
So I'm going to delay disclosure
regarding the hoodie.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.890
I want to keep that back
to keep him gabbing.

30:35.940 --> 30:39.849
If forensics come back positive, the hoodie
only gets us Michael Edgerton's murder.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.170
So we need the weapon and the device
Steve used to access that website

30:43.220 --> 30:46.130
if we're going to get him for the rest.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.180
I'll have my phone on me.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.700
Good luck.

31:31.539 --> 31:33.450
You have one new message.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.690
Hi, it's Jenna. I'm going
to Victoria Station.

31:35.740 --> 31:38.450
Can you meet me there, please?

31:38.500 --> 31:43.609
For the purposes of the recording,
I'm showing Steve exhibit JB2.

31:43.660 --> 31:46.130
What can you tell me about this man?

31:47.579 --> 31:49.329
I don't know him.

31:49.380 --> 31:51.970
We're investigating this
man as a possible suspect

31:52.019 --> 31:55.289
in the murder cases we're
talking to you about.

31:55.339 --> 31:58.369
What would you say if I told you
that it was this man's statement

31:58.420 --> 32:01.049
that brought you to our attention
and led to your arrest?

32:01.099 --> 32:02.397
I said I don't know him.

32:02.423 --> 32:06.290
You might not recognise him, but that
doesn't mean you don't know him, does it?

32:06.339 --> 32:09.380
You might've met him online.
On social media, perhaps?

32:10.980 --> 32:12.980
No. I don't know.

32:14.619 --> 32:18.809
It's our belief that the man with whom you've
been plotting and committing these murders

32:18.859 --> 32:21.210
is doing his best to
make sure we catch you

32:21.259 --> 32:23.569
and that you go to prison
for a very long time.

32:23.619 --> 32:25.410
What have you got to say about that?

32:25.460 --> 32:27.170
Look, I told you, I lied,

32:27.220 --> 32:29.890
but that was only about meeting
the guy with the steroids.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.809
You said it was OK.
- John McEnroe? - Yeah.

32:34.660 --> 32:39.009
We couldn't find anybody with
that name registered at your gym.

32:39.059 --> 32:42.369
Well, that's what he said
his name was. He did.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.650
Look, I don't know anything
about these murders

32:44.700 --> 32:46.769
or this bloke or any websites.

32:46.819 --> 32:49.160
OK, you should try and calm down.

32:52.059 --> 32:56.490
Why did you just mention websites?
- Because you were asking me about the internet.

32:56.539 --> 33:00.970
Yeah, that's right I was, but I
was talking about social media.

33:01.019 --> 33:04.730
So what are these other websites
that you know nothing about?

33:04.779 --> 33:06.730
I just meant Facebook and Twitter.

33:06.779 --> 33:10.170
How about the website
'Taking out the Trash'?

33:10.220 --> 33:12.289
What does that mean to you?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.490
Nothing.

33:15.539 --> 33:18.490
Have a little think. Are you sure?

33:18.539 --> 33:20.329
Yeah.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.528
Don't you believe me?

33:21.554 --> 33:24.971
You're looking quite distressed, Steve.
Can you tell me why that might be?

33:25.019 --> 33:27.329
Because I feel like I'm being set-up.
- Who by?

33:27.380 --> 33:28.208
You.

33:28.233 --> 33:30.691
Oh, I thought you meant the man
who'd given us this statement.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.650
Yeah, him as well.

33:32.700 --> 33:35.849
What reason do you think he might
have for doing that, Steve?

33:35.900 --> 33:38.970
How should I know? I've
never met him, this man.

33:39.019 --> 33:41.490
I haven't talked to him on a website.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.650
Why is he doing this to me?

33:44.700 --> 33:47.130
As I said before, we think
that you've being set-up.

33:47.180 --> 33:49.250
We think that you've
been set-up all along.

33:49.299 --> 33:52.529
So you think I'm innocent?
- I think you've been used.

33:52.579 --> 33:55.289
I think that you've been groomed
into committing these acts

33:55.339 --> 33:57.849
and now you're being set-up
to take the fall for them.

33:57.900 --> 34:00.650
And I think that if
that is the case,

34:00.700 --> 34:04.490
it's in your best interests to come
clean and help us catch this man

34:04.539 --> 34:06.680
before he hurts anybody else.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.090
Hey, Jenna. Where are you?

34:38.260 --> 34:39.860
Jenna!

34:40.940 --> 34:42.940
Jenna? Where's Jenna?

34:43.219 --> 34:44.820
Argh!

34:49.179 --> 34:51.179
Where's Jenna? Uhh!

34:51.980 --> 34:53.980
Jenna!

34:54.659 --> 34:56.260
Uhh!

34:59.960 --> 35:02.320
Where's Jenna? Uhh!

35:06.612 --> 35:08.213
Argh!

35:26.460 --> 35:28.460
Arghhh!

35:30.300 --> 35:33.300
Arghh!

36:01.460 --> 36:04.369
OK, so, on the day that Michael
Edgerton was murdered,

36:04.420 --> 36:07.489
I wondered if you could talk me
through the rest of your movements.

36:07.539 --> 36:09.690
I was at work.
- How did you get to work?

36:09.739 --> 36:13.090
I drove.
- How many cars do you have?

36:13.139 --> 36:15.889
Just the one.
- Which way did you go?

36:15.940 --> 36:18.250
Princess Road and then the A34.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.489
We checked all of the ANPR
for that route on that day...

36:21.539 --> 36:23.730
It's a busy route so
there's lots of cameras...

36:23.780 --> 36:27.500
And we didn't pick up your car once.
Can you tell me why that might be?

36:49.019 --> 36:51.019
Argh.

38:01.659 --> 38:06.250
If you didn't drive, how did
you get to work that day?

38:06.300 --> 38:09.769
Actually I wanted to do some work
on the way there so I took the bus.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.769
The quickest bus is 56 minutes, the
slowest... one hour 36 minutes.

38:13.820 --> 38:17.889
So, how is it possible for you to
get from the gym to the bus stop,

38:17.940 --> 38:21.019
catch a bus and get to work in 45 minutes?

38:26.059 --> 38:28.489
I got a lift.
- Who with?

38:28.539 --> 38:30.530
I'm not going to give you her name.

38:30.579 --> 38:32.769
I'm not dragging anyone else into this.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.849
We need to search Marion Coleman's car.

38:35.900 --> 38:38.389
He was using it on the day
of the Edgerton murder.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.445
Yeah, do it.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.849
According to Michael
Edgerton's girlfriend,

39:09.900 --> 39:12.929
Michael was a cleaner for Craig
Widnes' property company.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.409
Pass it on to Dodson.

39:36.139 --> 39:38.130
Yeah.

39:38.179 --> 39:40.179
OK, all right.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.610
All right, cheers.

39:57.976 --> 39:58.998
Hello.

39:59.023 --> 40:01.811
I need a unit to Hunts Bank,
Victoria Station basement now.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.570
Rach? Rach?

40:04.619 --> 40:08.460
Hunts Bank, Victoria. Get the Transport
Police in that basement now.

40:24.186 --> 40:26.186
You cannot stop this.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.480
I can stop you.

40:32.132 --> 40:34.253
Transport Police!

40:35.014 --> 40:37.574
Don't move! Stand still!

40:37.719 --> 40:39.429
Drop your weapon.

40:39.480 --> 40:43.070
I'm arresting you. You don't have to say
anything but it may harm your defence

40:43.119 --> 40:46.670
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

40:46.719 --> 40:50.280
If you do say anything it will be
given as evidence. Do you understand?

40:55.039 --> 40:58.710
Steve Dench was desperate
not to mention Marion's car.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.190
They found the knife and
they found the phone he used

41:01.239 --> 41:02.909
with the encryption codes.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.960
So that will give access to
details of all the murders.

41:07.914 --> 41:09.914
We stopped them.

41:11.063 --> 41:13.063
Not soon enough.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.789
Four months old and that
hand already looks like

41:36.840 --> 41:38.840
it could hold a pint pot.

41:42.039 --> 41:44.030
It's stuck around this long.

41:44.759 --> 41:47.858
I reckon it's earnt its
place in the bottom drawer.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.869
I can always sell it on the
darkweb if it gets on my nerves.

41:53.083 --> 41:55.380
So you're staying in Manchester?

41:55.661 --> 41:56.960
Yeah.

41:57.679 --> 42:02.309
I need to teach kids like Anna that
we've got every right to be here.

42:02.360 --> 42:07.030
Besides, you oldies won't
be around forever.

42:07.079 --> 42:10.079
Less time than you think if
I carry on breaking the law.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.389
I used Taisie's phone. I got
Sam to send some new pictures.

42:15.440 --> 42:19.750
Yeah, I know, I know. But when I show
them to the CPS, the case'll collapse.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.340
I had to prove that Sam's not a victim.

42:24.179 --> 42:26.170
What about your job?

42:26.882 --> 42:28.882
We'll see.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.539
Nobody has to know that it
wasn't Taisie who texted Sam.

42:42.659 --> 42:44.650
You've changed.

42:44.699 --> 42:46.690
I'm turning into you.

42:46.739 --> 42:49.139
No need to sound so upset about it.

42:52.380 --> 42:55.530
Jan, you did what you had to do.

42:55.579 --> 42:57.579
I shouldn't have had to.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.920
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

43:12.579 --> 43:15.690
I can't wait till it's born. I
might actually get my life back.

43:15.739 --> 43:17.849
I've been gagging for
a fag and a drink.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.010
I have not been sleeping properly.

43:20.059 --> 43:23.130
Yeah. As soon as it's
born, nothing but sleep.

43:23.179 --> 43:26.050
You're in for a shock.
- Oh, don't sound so smug.

43:26.099 --> 43:28.369
You're in prison if I grass you up.

43:28.420 --> 43:30.449
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.409
Free babysitting for life.

43:32.460 --> 43:34.460
You bugger.
