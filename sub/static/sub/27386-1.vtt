Dolores, my wife,
used to say that all the time.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.713
Well, not all the time,

32:02.715 --> 32:04.749

32:46.826 --> 32:48.692
Hey, I'm just saying it's salty.

32:48.694 --> 32:49.894
And salt's cheating.

32:49.896 --> 32:52.395
Any cook can make things salty.

32:52.397 --> 32:53.831
To make it taste good
without the salt,

32:53.833 --> 32:55.866
with just the other flavors,
that's the trick.

Except he called it
"Titsburgh."

33:07.847 --> 33:11.316
'Cause he said all
the women there had huge tits.

33:12.151 --> 33:13.818
That's absurd.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.986
Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breasts

33:15.988 --> 33:18.722
than, say, women in New York?

your nice town today,

01:14:47.012 --> 01:14:50.047
and I seen a store
that was selling suits.

01:14:50.049 --> 01:14:51.915

01:14:51.917 --> 01:14:55.385

a donation...

01:15:13.038 --> 01:15:15.038

for the way they treated me,

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.109
and you rewarded them.

01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:21.244

shouldn't matter to you.

paid 'em off.

I did what I had to do.

01:15:27.286 --> 01:15:29.687
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:31.988
Okay, Tony.

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.024

with the phony altruism

You were only thinking
about yourself back there

01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:40.397
because you know,
if I miss a show,

01:15:40.399 --> 01:15:41.998
it'll come out
of your pocketbook.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.034

Don't worry about it.

01:20:06.733 --> 01:20:10.200

01:20:28.253 --> 01:20:29.486
how to play like that?

01:20:29.488 --> 01:20:31.421
My mother.
Your mother?

01:20:31.423 --> 01:20:33.392
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.696
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

01:20:38.698 --> 01:20:41.264
Soon as I could walk, we'd...

01:20:41.266 --> 01:20:43.500
travel around
the Florida Panhandle,

01:20:43.502 --> 01:20:47.237
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

01:20:47.239 --> 01:20:49.439
Fortunately,
a man who had seen me play

01:20:49.441 --> 01:20:50.708
arranged for me to study

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.743
at the Leningrad Conservatory
of Music.

01:20:52.745 --> 01:20:55.578
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.015
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

01:20:58.017 --> 01:21:01.251
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

01:21:01.253 --> 01:21:05.524
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

01:21:06.591 --> 01:21:08.859
It's all I ever wanted to play.

01:21:08.861 --> 01:21:11.796
But I was persuaded
by my record company

01:21:11.798 --> 01:21:15.666
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

01:21:15.668 --> 01:21:18.268
They insisted that audiences
would never accept

01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:20.437
a Negro pianist
on a classical stage.

01:21:20.439 --> 01:21:25.341
Wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer.

01:21:25.343 --> 01:21:28.746
You know, the guy who's smoking
while he's playing

01:21:28.748 --> 01:21:31.615
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano,

01:21:31.617 --> 01:21:34.350
and then complains
because he's not respected

01:21:34.352 --> 01:21:35.753
like Arthur Rubinstein.

01:21:35.755 --> 01:21:38.656
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLING)</font> You don't
see Arthur Rubinstein

01:21:42.628 --> 01:21:44.662
I don't know.
Personally, I think,

01:21:44.664 --> 01:21:46.463
if you stuck
to the classic stuff,

01:21:46.465 --> 01:21:48.065
it would've been a big mistake.

01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:49.667

my entire life to play?

What are you, a seal?

01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:57.373
People love what you do.

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.810
Anyone could sound
like Beethoven or...

01:21:59.812 --> 01:22:02.378
"Joe Pan"
or them other guys you said,

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:06.318
but your music, what you do...

01:22:07.754 --> 01:22:09.554

can play Chopin.

As soon as he started playing,
a group of men
