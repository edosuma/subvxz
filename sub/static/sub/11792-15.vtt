WEBVTT

00:01.208 --> 00:02.612
Previously on nip/tuck...

00:02.613 --> 00:05.354
Kimber's missing. Coast guard

00:05.355 --> 00:08.125
thinks she's dead.

00:08.125 --> 00:12.131
I don't know what to do.

00:16.887 --> 00:18.715
Senor Perez.

00:20.382 --> 00:21.681
I'm Escobar Gallardo,

00:21.682 --> 00:24.812
the former boss of Silvio Perez.

00:24.813 --> 00:25.946
Oof!

00:26.848 --> 00:28.649
Silvio stole my daughter's

00:28.650 --> 00:29.883
innocence.

00:29.884 --> 00:30.617
Your brother said he was with

00:30.618 --> 00:32.683
the boss' girl. How old was she?

00:32.685 --> 00:35.619
She was 6.

00:40.557 --> 00:43.288
Tell me what you don't...

00:43.289 --> 00:44.487
And how old are you?

00:44.488 --> 00:46.453
15.

00:46.454 --> 00:47.720
All right. That's what I

00:47.721 --> 00:48.652
thought. I'm sorry, but any

00:48.653 --> 00:49.615
surgical procedure would require

00:49.616 --> 00:51.336
a parent present on a minor.

00:51.337 --> 00:52.567
Will your mother be joining

00:52.568 --> 00:53.464
us today?

00:53.465 --> 00:54.330
Not unless you can bring back

00:54.331 --> 00:55.429
the dead.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.791
Ahh. Sorry.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.356
You're exactly as my father

00:59.357 --> 01:03.657
described you.

01:03.658 --> 01:05.289
And your father is?

01:05.290 --> 01:07.856
In hell. With her. If there's

01:07.857 --> 01:08.991
any truth to what the nuns

01:08.992 --> 01:12.290
taught me in catholic school.

01:12.291 --> 01:16.026
They say I look like him.

01:16.027 --> 01:19.896
I'm aurelia Gallardo.

01:19.897 --> 01:23.698
Escobar Gallardo's daughter.

01:23.699 --> 01:27.301
The devil's child.

01:27.302 --> 01:28.702
Monsters never consider

01:28.703 --> 01:29.736
the shame they leave their

01:29.737 --> 01:31.804
children. It becomes part of

01:31.805 --> 01:34.606
their identity.

01:34.607 --> 01:37.373
Are you sure you're only 15?

01:37.374 --> 01:41.608
15. Old enough to understand

01:41.609 --> 01:43.009
all the suffering my family has

01:43.010 --> 01:44.576
inflicted on so many innocent

01:44.577 --> 01:45.709
people.

01:45.710 --> 01:47.510
Wow.

01:47.511 --> 01:49.745
Aurelia, I really don't know how

01:49.746 --> 01:50.879
we can help you.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.580
You can help me figure out

01:51.581 --> 01:52.614
who I am.

01:52.615 --> 01:53.414
I don't think that that...

01:53.415 --> 01:56.382
Silvio Perez,

01:56.383 --> 01:57.749
he was one of my father's

01:57.750 --> 02:00.650
business associates. I also seem

02:00.651 --> 02:01.784
to recall he was a patient of

02:01.785 --> 02:03.951
yours at one time. Am I correct?

02:03.952 --> 02:05.352
Well, he, uh...

02:05.353 --> 02:06.086
I'm sorry. That

02:06.087 --> 02:06.853
name doesn't

02:06.854 --> 02:09.354
ring any bells.

02:09.356 --> 02:12.582
Well, it was a long time ago.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.408
I was 8 when uncle Silvio

02:14.409 --> 02:16.569
disappeared. I started therapy

02:16.570 --> 02:18.335
a few years ago. Thought it

02:18.336 --> 02:20.770
might help with the nightmares.

02:20.771 --> 02:22.538
Of course, it's not surprising I

02:22.539 --> 02:25.172
had nightmares considering my

02:25.173 --> 02:28.073
life was one. I remember

02:28.074 --> 02:29.607
something about a surgery Silvio

02:29.608 --> 02:31.307
had when you practiced in

02:31.308 --> 02:32.608
Florida.

02:32.609 --> 02:35.610
Sorry. Unfortunately,

02:35.611 --> 02:38.011
I remember your

02:38.012 --> 02:40.579
father, but Silvio Perez?

02:40.580 --> 02:41.980
Sean?

02:41.981 --> 02:43.480
Uh, no. It doesn't sound

02:43.481 --> 02:47.182
familiar.

02:47.183 --> 02:49.883
Funny. There's so much

02:49.884 --> 02:51.150
violence I can't forget, no

02:51.151 --> 02:53.852
matter how hard I try. Yet

02:53.853 --> 02:56.220
the truth of who I am, why I

02:56.221 --> 02:58.388
feel the way I feel, that's

02:58.389 --> 03:01.823
still a mystery.

03:01.824 --> 03:03.524
I wish I could help you, but

03:03.525 --> 03:05.592
I can't.

03:05.593 --> 03:08.727
I understand.

03:08.728 --> 03:10.194
Maybe it's right that I never

03:10.195 --> 03:14.463
know. I suppose it's only just

03:14.464 --> 03:15.898
that I suffer for the sins of my

03:15.899 --> 03:18.965
father.

04:12.868 --> 04:13.535
Are you insane?

04:13.536 --> 04:14.301
I thought you'd be more

04:14.302 --> 04:15.302
sympathetic. You know what it's

04:15.303 --> 04:16.503
like to be abused at a young

04:16.504 --> 04:17.803
age, to want answers and

04:17.805 --> 04:18.805
closure.

04:18.805 --> 04:19.706
You're gonna get us closure

04:19.707 --> 04:20.540
in a jail cell.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.075
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

04:22.076 --> 04:22.943
Stop using my past to

04:22.944 --> 04:24.144
manipulate me into agreeing with

04:24.145 --> 04:24.945
you.

04:24.946 --> 04:25.746
What are you two guys arguing

04:25.747 --> 04:27.481
about today?

04:27.482 --> 04:30.450
You tell her.

04:30.451 --> 04:32.652
Our morning consult turned

04:32.653 --> 04:34.754
out to be Escobar's daughter.

04:34.755 --> 04:35.922
But don't worry, she's just

04:35.923 --> 04:38.492
a kid. He's dead, Gala's dead,

04:38.493 --> 04:39.559
and she's all alone.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.628
In Roman times, your enemies

04:41.629 --> 04:43.029
would kill your children after

04:43.030 --> 04:44.196
they killed you to make sure

04:44.197 --> 04:45.798
there was no one left to grow up

04:45.799 --> 04:47.799
to take revenge. Anyone who

04:47.800 --> 04:49.401
shares the blood of that animal

04:49.402 --> 04:50.535
is not to be trusted.

04:50.536 --> 04:51.937
She doesn't want revenge. She

04:51.938 --> 04:52.737
wants to know what happened to

04:52.738 --> 04:54.239
the man who molested her.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.540
Oh, and you're considering

04:55.541 --> 04:56.341
telling her?

04:56.342 --> 04:57.911
Look, I know in theory

04:57.912 --> 05:00.047
telling her what happened could

05:00.048 --> 05:02.016
somehow implicate us in a crime,

05:02.017 --> 05:02.816
but...

05:02.817 --> 05:04.250
A number of crimes.

05:04.251 --> 05:06.219
Cessory to murder, obstruction

05:06.220 --> 05:07.988
of justice. I mean, hell, they

05:07.989 --> 05:09.223
could nail us on an epa

05:09.224 --> 05:10.891
violation for feeding

05:10.892 --> 05:11.792
alligators.

05:11.793 --> 05:12.960
But there's isn't any

05:12.961 --> 05:14.428
evidence of any of that. And no

05:14.429 --> 05:15.395
one's ever gonna find it.

05:15.396 --> 05:16.663
Screw the evidence. All

05:16.664 --> 05:17.597
right, it's done. We got away

05:17.598 --> 05:18.932
with it. It's like winning

05:18.933 --> 05:19.799
the lottery. You don't screw

05:19.800 --> 05:20.733
with that kind of luck.

05:20.734 --> 05:21.868
Ok, no. We're not even gonna

05:21.869 --> 05:23.803
discuss it. I'm not gonna let

05:23.804 --> 05:25.439
you bring even a little piece of

05:25.440 --> 05:26.673
that man back into our lives

05:26.674 --> 05:28.341
to relive some kind of Irish

05:28.342 --> 05:29.342
catholic guilt that all of

05:29.343 --> 05:30.643
a sudden you're feeling.

05:30.644 --> 05:31.344
Liz.

05:31.345 --> 05:35.146
No! No. No.

05:35.147 --> 05:37.915
No.

05:37.916 --> 05:39.383
2 against 1, buddy boy. You

05:39.384 --> 05:43.820
lose.

05:43.821 --> 05:44.854
Tell me what you don't like

05:44.855 --> 05:46.222
about yourself, Ms. Hayes.

05:46.223 --> 05:48.658
This town, Dr. Troy, is

05:48.659 --> 05:50.493
an impossible place for a girl

05:50.494 --> 05:51.494
to be herself.

05:51.495 --> 05:52.229
Don't tell me you're

05:52.230 --> 05:53.765
an actress.

05:53.766 --> 05:55.035
Like everody else you meet

05:55.036 --> 05:57.003
on the street, right? Chicks

05:57.004 --> 05:58.605
like me are a dime a dozen in

05:58.606 --> 06:00.340
Hollywood. Back in Michigan,

06:00.341 --> 06:01.841
where I'm from, I was hot shit.

06:01.842 --> 06:02.776
I'd go to the clubs and

06:02.777 --> 06:04.243
the bouncers would say,

06:04.244 --> 06:07.146
"right this way, ten."

06:07.147 --> 06:11.684
Right this way, ten.

06:11.685 --> 06:14.950
Right this way, ten.

06:14.951 --> 06:19.854
Really? Is that what they'd say?

06:19.855 --> 06:23.891
I'm not a ten, am I?

06:23.892 --> 06:25.426
Out here I barely register as

06:25.427 --> 06:29.630
a six, maybe a seven. Out here,

06:29.631 --> 06:31.532
that makes me a nobody.

06:31.533 --> 06:32.466
You shouldn't be so rough on

06:32.467 --> 06:33.400
yourself. You're a very pretty

06:33.401 --> 06:35.602
girl.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.403
You really think so?

06:37.404 --> 06:42.974
Yes, I do.

06:42.975 --> 06:46.643
Would you bang me?

06:46.644 --> 06:49.646
On that desk. Right now.

06:49.647 --> 06:51.814
Unfortunately, that's not

06:51.815 --> 06:54.216
much of a barometer. I'm a horny

06:54.217 --> 06:55.518
devil.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.486
Then let's do it.

07:03.459 --> 07:07.095
Just hold on a second.

07:07.096 --> 07:08.629
Playing hide the tree trunk with

07:08.630 --> 07:11.732
me might, uh, boost your ego for

07:11.733 --> 07:13.334
a little while, but then

07:13.335 --> 07:14.335
eventually you have to go back

07:14.336 --> 07:16.404
to your real life as a six.

07:16.405 --> 07:17.405
Maybe a seven.

07:17.406 --> 07:21.408
Maybe a seven.

07:21.409 --> 07:22.643
You know, it's not as easy to

07:22.644 --> 07:23.777
sleep your way to the top as it

07:23.778 --> 07:25.645
used to be. Sexual

07:25.646 --> 07:27.280
harassment ruined everything.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.516
I'm sorry.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.917
I just...don't know how to get

07:32.918 --> 07:35.486
people to notice me. I'm

07:35.487 --> 07:37.088
actually not that bad of

07:37.089 --> 07:39.891
an actress, you know. Not that

07:39.892 --> 07:41.892
acting has anything to do with

07:41.893 --> 07:43.026
getting roles here.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.662
Then why stay?

07:45.663 --> 07:47.097
Why put yourself through

07:47.098 --> 07:48.398
constant humiliation when you

07:48.399 --> 07:49.699
could go back to your hometown

07:49.700 --> 07:53.770
and be homecoming queen again?

07:53.771 --> 07:56.472
Be a ten.

07:56.473 --> 07:58.174
Because I told everybody back

07:58.175 --> 07:59.442
home I was gonna make something

07:59.443 --> 08:02.546
of myself. That some day they'd

08:02.547 --> 08:04.649
be able to say "I knew her

08:04.650 --> 08:09.019
when." if I return now, I return

08:09.020 --> 08:09.920
a failure.

08:09.921 --> 08:11.688
Then let's try this again,

08:11.689 --> 08:15.660
shall we?

08:15.661 --> 08:16.828
Tell me what you don't like

08:16.829 --> 08:19.297
about yourself, Ms. Hayes.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.004
I am so happy that we are

08:27.005 --> 08:29.339
doing a simple mammoplasty

08:29.340 --> 08:31.208
today, and nothing's gonna go

08:31.209 --> 08:32.609
wrong. Right, Christian?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.442
Why would it?

08:34.443 --> 08:36.947
I don't know. Maybe because

08:36.948 --> 08:39.049
our surgical suite is directly

08:39.049 --> 08:40.216
over the gates of hell.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.520
I promise you, nothing will

08:43.520 --> 08:44.420
go wrong today.

08:44.421 --> 08:45.922
Oh, that sounds so good.

08:45.923 --> 08:46.990
We're just gonna listen to

08:46.991 --> 08:48.725
the music, do our job, go home.

08:48.726 --> 08:50.226
Sounds good, right?

08:50.227 --> 08:51.160
Sounds good to me.

08:51.161 --> 08:51.961
All right.

08:51.962 --> 08:53.696
Let's do it.

08:57.368 --> 08:59.035
She looks a lot like Kimber

08:59.036 --> 09:00.370
under the mask, doesn't she?

09:00.371 --> 09:01.370
Oh, she's definitely not as

09:01.371 --> 09:02.772
hot, but she's got the same

09:02.773 --> 09:04.474
color hair, same color of skin

09:04.475 --> 09:07.576
tone. Same breast implants.

09:07.577 --> 09:10.679
You remember? I gave Kimmy

09:10.680 --> 09:12.281
little Cs for her first surgery.

09:12.282 --> 09:13.582
They're our top seller.

09:13.583 --> 09:14.583
Yeah.

09:14.584 --> 09:15.651
There are a lot of girls

09:15.652 --> 09:17.119
in the world who have bad

09:17.120 --> 09:18.887
self-image problems, huh?

09:18.888 --> 09:22.390
Mm-Hmm. Ten blade.

11:31.778 --> 11:32.778
Some serious shit right here,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.513
Dr. Sean.

11:34.514 --> 11:35.614
What the hell am I supposed

11:35.615 --> 11:36.415
to do with this?

11:36.416 --> 11:40.251
Kill the wabbit, asshole. I

11:40.252 --> 11:41.386
mean, you could try to shoot

11:41.387 --> 11:42.153
me but...

11:43.522 --> 11:46.690
I'm already dead.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.360
Come on, Sean, kill it. Goddamn

11:50.361 --> 11:51.527
it, you're still such a pussy.

11:51.528 --> 11:52.661
50 years of school and you still

11:52.662 --> 11:54.696
don't get it. I dropped out in

11:54.697 --> 11:55.830
the second grade, and I even

11:55.831 --> 11:57.499
know. This thing is a metaphor.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.533
For what?

11:58.534 --> 11:59.668
For that prick Christian and

11:59.669 --> 12:01.736
all that shit he made you do.

12:01.737 --> 12:04.372
Silvio Perez, his brother, me.

12:04.373 --> 12:05.273
And that's just the big ticket

12:05.274 --> 12:06.707
items, man. You've been

12:06.708 --> 12:07.742
feeding him little bites of your

12:07.743 --> 12:08.976
soul every day since the day you

12:08.977 --> 12:10.244
met him, and then asking him,

12:10.245 --> 12:11.845
"would you like seconds,

12:11.846 --> 12:12.713
please?"

12:12.714 --> 12:14.448
I knew what I was doing. I

12:14.449 --> 12:15.549
made my choices.

12:15.550 --> 12:16.517
Oh, like choosing to keep

12:16.518 --> 12:17.851
your mouth shut when a poor

12:17.852 --> 12:18.652
little girl needs a daddy to

12:18.653 --> 12:19.353
talk to?

12:20.422 --> 12:21.956
Come on, man. Shoot him! Kill

12:21.957 --> 12:23.324
the douchebag once and for all.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.258
Be a man for once in your waste

12:24.259 --> 12:24.992
of a life.

12:39.076 --> 12:40.476
Ok, doctor man, let's cut this

12:40.477 --> 12:41.444
bad boy open and see what's

12:41.445 --> 12:44.242
inside of him.

12:52.384 --> 12:53.951
Have you seen Peter pan?

12:53.952 --> 12:56.020
That's you, dude. Taking people

12:56.021 --> 12:58.422
to Neverland so they never grow

12:58.423 --> 13:01.792
old. Hey, didn't he get eaten by

13:01.793 --> 13:02.760
an alligator, too?

13:02.761 --> 13:05.561
Will you shut up?

13:12.670 --> 13:14.171
It's Silvio's.

13:14.172 --> 13:18.376
Maybe.

13:18.377 --> 13:21.412
My daughter has no one, Sean.

13:21.413 --> 13:23.748
Her whole family is gone. But

13:23.749 --> 13:25.015
she has the guts to come to you,

13:25.016 --> 13:27.316
look you in the eyes, ask you

13:27.317 --> 13:30.619
for the truth. An innocent. She

13:30.620 --> 13:32.220
needs your help.

13:32.221 --> 13:33.254
You're the one who got her

13:33.255 --> 13:35.422
into this. You and my partner.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.325
Alligator boy? You're right,

13:38.326 --> 13:39.559
we did. We got both of you into

13:39.560 --> 13:42.294
it. You are both innocents.

13:42.295 --> 13:43.796
And now I'm all taken care of,

13:43.797 --> 13:44.598
but what are you going to do

13:44.599 --> 13:45.732
about him?

13:45.733 --> 13:46.967
What am I supposed to do?

13:46.968 --> 13:48.470
He's my best friend.

13:48.471 --> 13:53.241
You've got 2 choices. Eat

13:53.242 --> 13:55.743
or be eaten.

14:31.968 --> 14:33.668
Hey. I'm looking for Virginia

14:33.669 --> 14:35.436
Hayes.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.136
I'm Dr. Troy, Ms. Hayes'

14:37.137 --> 14:38.337
surgeon. Can I help you?

14:38.338 --> 14:39.471
Is she still here?

14:39.472 --> 14:41.940
Um, where do you keep them,

14:41.941 --> 14:42.740
down here?

14:42.741 --> 14:43.542
I'm sorry, are you a family

14:43.543 --> 14:44.210
member?

14:44.211 --> 14:45.412
Could be. Not sure exactly.

14:45.413 --> 14:46.180
I'll tell you when I see her.

14:46.181 --> 14:47.047
No, no, no. Why don't you

14:47.048 --> 14:48.482
just tell me right now?

14:48.483 --> 14:49.816
I'm the one getting all of

14:49.817 --> 14:50.784
her bills.

14:50.785 --> 14:52.352
What the hell does that mean?

14:52.353 --> 14:55.351
I'm Virginia Hayes. The woman

14:55.352 --> 14:57.185
you gave new tits to stole my

14:57.186 --> 15:01.154
identity.

15:01.155 --> 15:02.321
I'm sure it's just some kind

15:02.322 --> 15:03.255
of misunderstanding.

15:03.256 --> 15:04.156
She tried to bang you, didn't

15:04.157 --> 15:04.857
she?

15:04.858 --> 15:05.590
What? No.

15:05.591 --> 15:06.524
The last time I got this

15:06.525 --> 15:07.559
close, the watch salesman had

15:07.560 --> 15:08.728
screwed her on his Rolex

15:08.729 --> 15:10.130
display, so of course he took

15:10.131 --> 15:11.699
her side. Must be a pretty good

15:11.700 --> 15:12.399
lay.

15:13.134 --> 15:14.134
Virginia, dear, you have

15:14.135 --> 15:16.936
a visitor. Where are you?

15:16.937 --> 15:18.271
She can't have gone too far,

15:18.272 --> 15:19.840
trust me. Linda, get your ass in

15:19.841 --> 15:22.209
here. Uh.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.877
Dammit. Thought I had

15:24.878 --> 15:25.778
her this time.

15:25.779 --> 15:26.646
Don't worry, Ms. Hayes. I'm

15:26.647 --> 15:27.447
sure that the credit card

15:27.448 --> 15:28.347
company won't stick you with

15:28.348 --> 15:29.049
the bill.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.317
No, but they will stick you

15:30.318 --> 15:32.552
with it. You know,

15:32.553 --> 15:33.719
the merchant's the one who pays

15:33.720 --> 15:36.590
in fraud. Not the victim and not

15:36.591 --> 15:40.662
the creditor.

15:40.663 --> 15:43.231
Her Lexus, it's not in

15:43.232 --> 15:44.166
the structure.

15:44.167 --> 15:50.567
She drives a Lexus. A $600

15:51.906 --> 15:54.637
a month Lexus while I drive

15:54.638 --> 15:59.808
a piece of shit '87 Corolla.

15:59.809 --> 16:01.646
How did you find out she had

16:01.647 --> 16:02.747
the operation?

16:02.748 --> 16:04.917
Oh, I got a guy. A private

16:04.918 --> 16:06.653
dick. He's been searching for

16:06.654 --> 16:09.089
her for 3 years now. I mean,

16:09.090 --> 16:10.624
that is how long I have known

16:10.625 --> 16:11.892
about this bitch.

16:11.893 --> 16:12.994
And you don't know her real

16:12.995 --> 16:13.795
name?

16:13.796 --> 16:15.897
No. No, no, no. No, she's

16:15.898 --> 16:18.333
that good. No, she just uses my

16:18.334 --> 16:20.670
name every once in a while. So

16:20.671 --> 16:22.072
it's almost like I forget about

16:22.073 --> 16:24.508
her, and then something pops up

16:24.509 --> 16:27.612
again. 3 weeks ago I get my

16:27.613 --> 16:28.880
first bill from that Lexus

16:28.881 --> 16:31.316
dealer, so I call my P.I., he

16:31.317 --> 16:32.651
starts keeping an eye out for

16:32.652 --> 16:33.920
everything with my social

16:33.921 --> 16:35.555
security number on it, calls me

16:35.556 --> 16:38.557
this morning, and says she got

16:38.558 --> 16:40.292
a new card and it was used here

16:40.293 --> 16:41.093
yesterday.

16:41.094 --> 16:43.094
Can't you just cancel your

16:43.095 --> 16:44.662
credit cards and move on?

16:44.663 --> 16:47.865
No. You can't just go on with

16:47.866 --> 16:50.501
your life. My life is totally

16:50.502 --> 16:53.470
screwed. I can't get a job, ok,

16:53.471 --> 16:54.338
because she got caught

16:54.339 --> 16:56.273
shoplifting 2 years ago and she

16:56.274 --> 16:58.508
used my name. Me and my husband

16:58.509 --> 17:00.410
divorced so we could keep his

17:00.411 --> 17:01.611
assets separate, then

17:01.612 --> 17:03.446
the asshole realizes he's got

17:03.447 --> 17:04.980
a free pass to screwing around.

17:04.981 --> 17:06.482
So now he's gone. Not that I

17:06.483 --> 17:08.083
blame him because I'm in this

17:08.084 --> 17:09.818
pissy mood all the time because

17:09.819 --> 17:11.319
I spend most of my time on hold

17:11.320 --> 17:13.855
trying to clear my name with one

17:13.856 --> 17:15.490
credit bureau or another.

17:15.491 --> 17:20.994
Hmm. Well, Ms. Hayes, I don't

17:20.996 --> 17:21.963
know how we can help, but if

17:21.964 --> 17:23.798
there's anything... anything we

17:23.799 --> 17:24.699
can do.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.300
You can stop being enamored

17:27.301 --> 17:30.872
with every little ingenue that

17:30.873 --> 17:33.141
walks through your doors. Ok, I

17:33.142 --> 17:36.244
have heard her story. She plays

17:36.245 --> 17:38.379
the victim and guys fall at her

17:38.380 --> 17:41.515
feet. So here's what you can

17:41.516 --> 17:45.118
do, Dr. Troy. Stop being such

17:45.119 --> 17:48.153
a chump.

18:20.494 --> 18:21.927
My daughter used to love to

18:21.928 --> 18:24.996
swing. The higher I'd push her,

18:24.997 --> 18:26.665
the more she'd beg me not to

18:26.666 --> 18:27.799
stop.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.633
My father and I could never

18:29.634 --> 18:33.770
play outside. Too dangerous.

18:33.771 --> 18:35.872
It was years before I realized

18:35.873 --> 18:37.874
he was worried about his safety,

18:37.875 --> 18:41.109
not mine.

18:41.110 --> 18:43.644
Thank you, Dr. McNamara, for

18:43.645 --> 18:46.513
calling me.

18:46.514 --> 18:48.281
I was surprised, actually, to

18:48.282 --> 18:51.417
hear from you.

18:51.418 --> 18:53.320
Your visit took us a bit by

18:53.321 --> 18:59.721
surprise, too.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.962
Your instinct was right about

19:01.963 --> 19:07.266
your uncle. He did...

19:07.267 --> 19:08.868
He molested you when you were

19:08.869 --> 19:11.704
young.

19:11.705 --> 19:15.908
How young?

19:15.909 --> 19:20.412
6.

19:20.413 --> 19:22.748
Silvio offered us a lot money to

19:22.749 --> 19:26.217
do a facial reconstruction. We

19:26.218 --> 19:28.019
had no idea why he wanted it,

19:28.020 --> 19:28.919
what...

19:28.920 --> 19:30.854
So you did his surgery?

19:30.855 --> 19:33.056
Yeah.

19:33.057 --> 19:36.058
And then he wanted another one.

19:36.059 --> 19:38.393
Your father tracked him down. He

19:38.394 --> 19:40.061
wanted vengeance for what Silvio

19:40.062 --> 19:42.397
had done to you.

19:42.398 --> 19:45.466
So he killed this man? One

19:45.467 --> 19:47.434
monster killed another?

19:47.435 --> 19:50.607
No. Actually, no. He would

19:50.608 --> 19:51.809
have, but Silvio's brother

19:51.810 --> 19:54.582
Alejandro got there first. He

19:54.583 --> 19:57.620
broke into our surgical suite

19:57.621 --> 20:00.055
and he held him down while he

20:00.056 --> 20:01.423
turned up the anesthesia.

20:01.424 --> 20:02.892
They were enemies?

20:02.893 --> 20:04.393
No, I think Alejandro loved

20:04.394 --> 20:07.096
his brother, but he was

20:07.097 --> 20:08.731
frightened. He... he knew what

20:08.732 --> 20:10.299
Silvio had done to you and

20:10.300 --> 20:13.769
when he found out his wife was

20:13.770 --> 20:15.271
about to have a baby girl,

20:15.272 --> 20:16.572
he didn't want to take any

20:16.573 --> 20:20.609
chances. By the time your father

20:20.610 --> 20:22.444
got there, Silvio was dead.

20:22.445 --> 20:23.946
And you never went to

20:23.947 --> 20:25.114
the police?

20:25.115 --> 20:27.883
He died on our table. If we'd

20:27.884 --> 20:29.685
have reported it, we would have

20:29.686 --> 20:31.253
lost our medical license. We had

20:31.254 --> 20:32.220
no choice but to dispose of

20:32.221 --> 20:33.288
Silvio's body.

20:33.289 --> 20:35.457
You had a choice.

20:35.458 --> 20:40.028
You madet.

20:40.029 --> 20:44.066
Yeah.

20:44.067 --> 20:47.704
Yeah.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.373
Alejandro followed us to

20:50.374 --> 20:53.209
the swamp where we dumped it and

20:53.210 --> 20:55.745
soon after your father killed

20:55.746 --> 20:58.514
him. To get rid of the evidence

20:58.515 --> 21:01.749
for our sake, he said.

21:05.151 --> 21:08.185
Thank you, Dr. McNamara,

21:08.186 --> 21:11.021
for telling me the truth.

21:11.022 --> 21:13.957
I was born into the world of

21:13.958 --> 21:18.328
Escobar Gallardo. Evil and

21:18.329 --> 21:22.632
violence was all I knew. Maybe

21:22.633 --> 21:24.801
now I caput it behind me,

21:24.802 --> 21:26.436
start fresh.

21:26.437 --> 21:29.772
Me, too.

21:37.414 --> 21:40.649
Whoo!

21:49.794 --> 21:51.528
That's some kid. Takes after

21:51.529 --> 21:57.067
the old man, don't she, Sean?

21:57.068 --> 22:00.837
Thank you.

22:00.838 --> 22:02.438
I got you!

22:16.986 --> 22:19.354
Ahh! That's taking a really

22:19.355 --> 22:20.422
long time.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.756
It takes longer if you keep

22:21.757 --> 22:22.824
interrupting.

22:22.825 --> 22:26.861
Look, I am in a lot of pain.

22:26.862 --> 22:29.630
Is there anything you can do to

22:29.631 --> 22:30.798
hurry it up?

22:30.799 --> 22:34.168
Try these. They should ease

22:34.169 --> 22:35.603
the pain. At least until

22:35.604 --> 22:41.909
the cops get here. Thanks, Mort.

22:41.910 --> 22:43.478
How did you find me?

22:43.479 --> 22:44.645
I called every pharmacy in

22:44.646 --> 22:45.746
the area. I asked them to

22:45.747 --> 22:47.782
contact me if a new c-cup tried

22:47.783 --> 22:48.816
to fill up the prescription i

22:48.817 --> 22:52.386
wrote. I'm serious about

22:52.387 --> 22:54.688
the pills. Who knows what

22:54.689 --> 22:58.459
they'll give you in jail.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.294
Please, don't call

23:00.295 --> 23:01.095
the police.

23:01.096 --> 23:03.964
Heh. Why? You have a check

23:03.965 --> 23:04.765
for me?

23:04.766 --> 23:06.634
I don't have anything

23:06.635 --> 23:09.670
anymore.

23:09.671 --> 23:13.140
I'm really sorry. I... I never

23:13.141 --> 23:15.042
imagined that this would happen.

23:15.043 --> 23:17.244
You stole that woman's social

23:17.245 --> 23:18.645
security, her credit cards,

23:18.646 --> 23:20.514
skipped out on a $5,000

23:20.515 --> 23:21.782
procedure. What did you think

23:21.783 --> 23:22.716
would happen?

23:22.717 --> 23:25.285
I meant I never imagined

23:25.286 --> 23:29.089
that...my life could end up to

23:29.090 --> 23:30.557
be such a failure.

23:30.558 --> 23:32.325
Wow. What do you think, Mort,

23:32.326 --> 23:34.027
huh? Surprised she doesn't get

23:34.028 --> 23:35.195
more jobs. She's one hell of

23:35.196 --> 23:35.995
an actress.

23:35.996 --> 23:39.799
Oh. Wait. I'm not an actress.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.468
Look, it was all a lie. I'm just

23:42.469 --> 23:45.138
Marcy Hamels from des moines. I

23:45.139 --> 23:46.305
came out here to get my real

23:46.306 --> 23:47.774
estate license, but I failed

23:47.775 --> 23:49.976
the exam. I have dyslexia.

23:49.977 --> 23:50.910
And then I had this problem with

23:50.911 --> 23:52.412
my job where I got these

23:52.413 --> 23:54.948
headaches and I couldn't focus.

23:54.949 --> 23:56.549
And the temp agency fired me.

23:56.550 --> 23:57.317
And everything just went to

23:57.318 --> 23:59.085
shit. I didn't know what else to

23:59.086 --> 23:59.919
do.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.720
You didn't know what else to

24:00.721 --> 24:01.487
do, so you decided to get breast

24:01.488 --> 24:02.455
implants, huh?

24:02.456 --> 24:04.490
Yes. I thought a new body

24:04.491 --> 24:06.692
might get me a new life.

24:06.693 --> 24:08.093
And everyone out here who's

24:08.094 --> 24:10.329
anyone has them. I was just

24:10.330 --> 24:11.397
trying to fit in.

24:11.398 --> 24:12.131
You do realize what you did

24:12.132 --> 24:18.003
to the real Virginia, don't you?

24:18.004 --> 24:22.808
I feel horrible.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.776
I always told myself that I'd

24:24.777 --> 24:28.413
find a way to pay her back.

24:28.414 --> 24:29.614
You don't have to do that.

24:29.615 --> 24:32.484
No. No, I want to.

24:32.485 --> 24:33.318
No, I mean, you don't have to

24:33.319 --> 24:34.352
do that because you don't have

24:34.353 --> 24:37.422
to pay for the procedure. If you

24:37.423 --> 24:39.224
had told me your story, we

24:39.225 --> 24:41.726
could have worked something out.

24:41.727 --> 24:46.129
Really?

24:46.130 --> 24:48.665
Of course. Matter of fact, if

24:48.666 --> 24:49.966
you come back in, I'll lipo away

24:49.967 --> 24:52.835
a few pounds for free.

24:52.836 --> 24:54.537
Why would you do that?

24:54.538 --> 24:57.706
I became a surgeon to change

24:57.707 --> 25:02.849
people's lives. And well...

25:02.850 --> 25:03.883
You look like you could use

25:03.884 --> 25:08.087
a little help.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.395
See the look I've had

25:15.396 --> 25:20.602
could make a good man turn bad,

25:20.603 --> 25:22.670
so please... 

25:22.671 --> 25:24.038
What are you doing? I thought

25:24.039 --> 25:25.105
she was having lipo.

25:25.106 --> 25:28.108
So did she. Thank God she's

25:28.109 --> 25:28.909
lonely and desperate enough to

25:28.910 --> 25:30.009
fall for the grade-a bullshit I

25:30.010 --> 25:31.677
Fed her in the pharmacy, huh?

25:31.678 --> 25:32.378
She actually thought that I

25:32.379 --> 25:34.246
cared about her. These C-cups

25:34.247 --> 25:35.380
right here, they're the property

25:35.381 --> 25:36.882
of McNamara/Troy. I'm

25:36.883 --> 25:39.717
repossessing them.

25:39.718 --> 25:42.986
You can't foreclose implants.

25:42.987 --> 25:45.621
Watch me.

25:45.622 --> 25:46.689
Why don't you just go to

25:46.690 --> 25:47.490
the police?

25:47.491 --> 25:48.324
What, and lose all

25:48.325 --> 25:50.426
the personal satisfaction? I'm

25:50.427 --> 25:51.360
tired of being taken advantage

25:51.361 --> 25:53.027
of. This bitch is just the last

25:53.028 --> 25:54.696
in a long line of gold diggers

25:54.697 --> 25:56.264
who have tried to milk me dry.

26:00.468 --> 26:01.368
You don't know what it's like

26:01.369 --> 26:02.936
to be taken advantage of, ok. I

26:02.937 --> 26:03.736
feel like a goddamn Chinese

26:03.737 --> 26:04.670
buffet.

26:04.671 --> 26:08.240
I get it. I do, I get it. You

26:08.241 --> 26:09.741
dealt with the pain of Kimber's

26:09.742 --> 26:10.909
death with her mother, but you

26:10.910 --> 26:12.043
haven't dealt with your rage.

26:12.044 --> 26:14.445
And it's normal to be angry.

26:14.446 --> 26:15.379
Especially when you didn't get

26:15.380 --> 26:16.313
a warning, you didn't get

26:16.314 --> 26:18.482
a note. You had no closure. But

26:18.483 --> 26:19.349
I'm telling you right now, this

26:19.350 --> 26:21.884
is not gonna give you closure.

26:21.885 --> 26:23.085
I don't give a damn why I'm

26:23.086 --> 26:24.053
doing it. All I know is that I

26:24.054 --> 26:26.722
feel much better. Linda, close

26:26.723 --> 26:30.291
this bitch up for me, would you?

27:43.775 --> 27:46.643
You're right.

27:46.644 --> 27:47.911
I also got you some

27:47.912 --> 27:48.945
pamphlets for some woman's

27:48.946 --> 27:50.614
shelters. You're welcome to use

27:50.615 --> 27:52.951
the phone here if you'd like.

27:52.952 --> 27:53.718
They'll help you get back on

27:53.719 --> 27:56.320
your feet...

27:56.321 --> 27:59.890
In an honest way.

27:59.891 --> 28:01.392
In the meantime, if you feel any

28:01.393 --> 28:02.459
pain at all, just go ahead and

28:02.460 --> 28:03.727
press that button. Be careful,

28:03.728 --> 28:04.862
it's morphine, so don't overdo

28:04.863 --> 28:08.498
it. Hang in there.

28:08.499 --> 28:11.535
Dr. Troy? Could I ask you for

28:11.536 --> 28:12.769
one more favor?

28:12.770 --> 28:14.504
Are you kidding me?

28:14.505 --> 28:15.805
Could you give me Virginia's

28:15.806 --> 28:18.674
number? I want to call her

28:18.675 --> 28:22.644
myself. Tell her I'm sorry.

28:22.645 --> 28:26.581
She's only gonna call

28:26.582 --> 28:29.784
the police.

28:29.785 --> 28:33.454
Well, heh, if that's what she

28:33.455 --> 28:38.626
does. There's probably already

28:38.627 --> 28:44.197
a warrant for my arrest. Right?

28:44.198 --> 28:47.200
And if I'm gonna start a new

28:47.201 --> 28:53.446
life, I can't stay on the run.

28:53.447 --> 28:54.747
Who knows, maybe she'll be nice

28:54.748 --> 28:56.516
like you were and we'll work

28:56.517 --> 28:58.584
something out.

29:05.525 --> 29:06.358
I'll leave her number right

29:06.359 --> 29:09.761
here. Get some rest first,

29:09.762 --> 29:12.130
though. You look like you need

29:12.131 --> 29:14.931
it.

29:20.104 --> 29:22.672
Christian, this is special

29:22.673 --> 29:24.507
agent Reynolds and agent Ryan

29:24.508 --> 29:25.675
from the FBI.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.743
What are the feds doing here?

29:27.744 --> 29:28.578
We're not pressing any charges

29:28.579 --> 29:30.713
against Ms. Hamels.

29:30.714 --> 29:31.914
I'm sorry?

29:31.915 --> 29:33.150
There must be some sort of

29:33.151 --> 29:35.153
confusion. We're here to talk to

29:35.154 --> 29:39.824
you about Silvio Perez.

29:39.825 --> 29:41.325
She's an interesting girl, wise

29:41.326 --> 29:42.726
beyond her years.

29:42.727 --> 29:43.727
Makes sense growing up in

29:43.728 --> 29:45.428
a family like that.

29:45.429 --> 29:46.696
Did she say anything about

29:46.697 --> 29:47.864
why she would make up a story

29:47.865 --> 29:48.765
like this?

29:48.766 --> 29:49.699
Said she wanted to change her

29:49.700 --> 29:51.302
identity. Said she was raised by

29:51.303 --> 29:53.973
killers, surrounded by evil.

29:53.974 --> 29:55.474
Kid's full of guilt. She kept

29:55.475 --> 29:56.475
going on about how her braces

29:56.476 --> 29:57.677
were paid for with the blood of

29:57.678 --> 29:58.677
innocents.

29:58.678 --> 29:59.478
She said she couldn't be

29:59.479 --> 30:01.680
a good person and let a bad deed

30:01.681 --> 30:02.948
go unpunished.

30:02.949 --> 30:04.149
We were gonna ask you

30:04.150 --> 30:05.417
the same question, though.

30:05.418 --> 30:06.918
Oh, I have no idea. She came

30:06.919 --> 30:08.286
in for a consult the other day,

30:08.287 --> 30:10.221
asked us about this Silvio

30:10.222 --> 30:12.756
Perez. We told her we didn't

30:12.757 --> 30:13.957
know anything, and she left.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.658
The kid's loco.

30:15.659 --> 30:17.293
We're plastic surgeons.

30:17.294 --> 30:18.127
Who do have a number of

30:18.128 --> 30:20.263
connections to Escobar Gallardo.

30:20.264 --> 30:22.099
Let's not forget that he was

30:22.100 --> 30:23.768
last seen in your offices and

30:23.769 --> 30:25.837
that he left a trail of dead

30:25.838 --> 30:27.338
peace officers as payment for

30:27.339 --> 30:28.840
services rendered.

30:28.841 --> 30:29.640
Which is probably why she's

30:29.641 --> 30:31.875
fixated on us. We were very

30:31.876 --> 30:33.043
transparent in our dealings with

30:33.044 --> 30:33.911
Escobar.

30:33.912 --> 30:34.978
What about Silvio Perez?

30:34.979 --> 30:36.446
First time we hard the name

30:36.447 --> 30:37.548
was when she mentioned it in

30:37.549 --> 30:39.516
the consult.

30:39.517 --> 30:41.587
That true for all of you?

30:41.588 --> 30:44.457
Yes, it is.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.526
Well, we're sorry to have

30:46.527 --> 30:47.927
taken up your time. You should

30:47.928 --> 30:49.529
know we've started an active

30:49.530 --> 30:50.863
investigation. Probably won't go

30:50.864 --> 30:52.732
anywhere, but anything related

30:52.733 --> 30:54.233
to the war on drugs gives our

30:54.234 --> 30:55.401
bosses hard-ons.

30:55.402 --> 30:56.235
We'd like copies of all your

30:56.236 --> 30:57.036
records from the time in

30:57.037 --> 30:57.937
question.

30:57.938 --> 30:59.805
Oh, that's ok. I mean, it'll

30:59.806 --> 31:00.973
take a few days because, you

31:00.974 --> 31:03.275
know, things got mixed up when

31:03.276 --> 31:04.743
we moved here from Miami.

31:04.744 --> 31:08.414
Well, just call my office.

31:08.415 --> 31:11.050
We'll send a courier.

31:11.051 --> 31:11.950
We'll be sure to keep this

31:11.951 --> 31:13.585
quiet.

31:13.586 --> 31:15.287
Thanks. And remember, we

31:15.288 --> 31:17.089
offer a 20% off to law

31:17.090 --> 31:19.891
enforcement.

31:25.765 --> 31:28.233
Am I dreaming? Would someone

31:28.234 --> 31:29.334
tell me if I'm dreaming?

31:29.335 --> 31:30.168
I never thought she'd go to

31:30.169 --> 31:30.969
the police.

31:30.970 --> 31:31.836
Are you out of your goddamn

31:31.837 --> 31:32.637
mind? I mean, how could you be

31:32.638 --> 31:33.405
so stupid?

31:33.406 --> 31:34.205
I'm gonna check on the files

31:34.206 --> 31:35.140
and see if there's anything in

31:35.141 --> 31:35.907
there.

31:35.908 --> 31:36.674
Lizzie, you get that shredder

31:36.675 --> 31:37.575
humming. And remember, when in

31:37.576 --> 31:42.647
doubt, Chuck it out.

31:42.648 --> 31:44.649
I'm sorry, Christian. I

31:44.650 --> 31:46.617
honestly thought that girl

31:46.618 --> 31:48.219
deserves someone in her life who

31:48.220 --> 31:49.187
is willing to tell her

31:49.188 --> 31:52.223
the truth.

31:52.224 --> 31:54.125
Don't you apologize to him.

31:54.126 --> 31:56.127
You don't owe him Jack shit.

31:56.128 --> 31:57.762
Well, Mr. Holier-than-thou, I

31:57.763 --> 31:58.896
don't intend to spend the rest

31:58.897 --> 32:00.364
of my life in prison, so shut

32:00.365 --> 32:01.632
your mouth or have your moral

32:01.633 --> 32:02.766
crisis at some other point in

32:02.767 --> 32:03.534
time.

32:03.535 --> 32:04.301
Do you hear the way he talks

32:04.302 --> 32:05.369
to you? It's only going to get

32:05.370 --> 32:07.171
worse. He has absolutely no

32:07.172 --> 32:08.505
respect for you, Sean.

32:08.506 --> 32:09.540
I never wanted anything to do

32:09.541 --> 32:11.108
with that Perez case, if you

32:11.109 --> 32:11.942
recall.

32:11.943 --> 32:12.776
You think your shit doesn't

32:12.777 --> 32:13.810
stink as bad as mine?

32:13.811 --> 32:14.578
After all these years, I'm

32:14.579 --> 32:15.879
sure it does.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.914
I don't know how much longer I

32:16.915 --> 32:17.948
can live with it.

32:17.949 --> 32:18.849
That's a start. Now get up in

32:18.850 --> 32:24.054
his face.

32:24.055 --> 32:25.455
Say, "I ain't gonna pay for your

32:25.456 --> 32:28.391
shit, Christian. Your ass is

32:28.392 --> 32:29.859
the only one that's gonna fry.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.062
I'm the bad ass now, and I'm

32:32.063 --> 32:34.097
gonna take care of Sean. And

32:34.098 --> 32:35.098
there ain't nothing you can do

32:35.099 --> 32:37.433
about it, lizardman." now all

32:37.434 --> 32:39.469
you have to do is a drop a dime

32:39.470 --> 32:41.804
on him, baby. You know it's his

32:41.805 --> 32:43.906
fault. Your word against his.

32:43.907 --> 32:45.508
Who do you think they're gonna

32:45.509 --> 32:47.944
believe?

32:47.945 --> 32:49.745
We're gonna get through this.

32:49.746 --> 32:51.414
It's her word against ours. Who

32:51.415 --> 32:52.114
do you think they're gonna

32:52.115 --> 32:54.016
believe?

32:54.017 --> 32:55.551
You need to find a better way to

32:55.552 --> 32:58.987
deal with your stinky shit.

33:11.233 --> 33:16.938
Hello, Marcy.

33:16.939 --> 33:19.640
Virginia?

33:19.641 --> 33:21.776
I finally found you.

33:21.777 --> 33:27.782
Oh. You got my message.

33:27.783 --> 33:31.685
Ow. I didn't realize you'd be

33:31.686 --> 33:35.022
stopping by tonight.

33:35.023 --> 33:38.158
Yeah. I had to.

33:38.159 --> 33:42.262
I mean, things like this just

33:42.263 --> 33:46.399
can't be done over the phone.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.703
You're right.

33:50.704 --> 33:54.440
And I'm glad you're here.

34:01.515 --> 34:03.383
I hope you can find some way to

34:03.384 --> 34:06.185
forgive me.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.060
Never!

34:14.061 --> 34:17.397
Never! You hear me?

34:18.866 --> 34:21.533
Oh!

34:50.773 --> 34:55.342
Knock knock.

34:55.344 --> 34:58.512
You, uh, sleep ok last night?

34:58.513 --> 35:02.648
Yeah, well, me neither. Heh. Not

35:02.649 --> 35:04.616
to make excuses, but I've had

35:04.617 --> 35:07.552
a really tough couple of weeks

35:07.553 --> 35:09.620
lately. I lost somebody very

35:09.621 --> 35:12.789
close to me. And, um, well,

35:12.790 --> 35:14.223
look, the point is, I haven't

35:14.224 --> 35:17.259
been myself. You were right. I

35:17.260 --> 35:18.359
was cruel, and I'm sorry. I

35:18.360 --> 35:19.861
just... right or wrong, you're

35:19.862 --> 35:21.696
just trying to make yourself

35:21.697 --> 35:24.665
feel better. And I understand

35:24.666 --> 35:27.467
that impulse.

35:54.224 --> 35:55.391
You're lucky we never backed

35:55.392 --> 35:57.192
up our files online in Miami.

35:57.193 --> 35:58.493
All we have are these hard

35:58.494 --> 36:00.061
copies, and they're incomplete.

36:00.062 --> 36:01.364
We have a problem.

36:01.365 --> 36:02.500
I doubt it. I don't think

36:02.501 --> 36:04.101
Silvio Perez even put his name

36:04.102 --> 36:04.969
on the patient...

36:04.970 --> 36:05.836
It's not Silvio, it's Marcy

36:05.837 --> 36:06.871
Hamels.

36:06.872 --> 36:07.872
The i.d. Thief?

36:07.873 --> 36:08.706
Yeah, she's dead in

36:08.707 --> 36:09.874
the recovery suite.

36:09.875 --> 36:10.774
She what?

36:10.775 --> 36:12.275
She's dead in the recovery

36:12.276 --> 36:14.710
room. I tricked her into going

36:14.711 --> 36:17.279
under so that I could repossess

36:17.280 --> 36:18.147
her breasts.

36:18.148 --> 36:19.014
Are you insane?

36:19.015 --> 36:20.716
Maybe she had an adverse

36:20.717 --> 36:22.350
reaction to the anesthesia or

36:22.351 --> 36:23.718
O.D'd on the morphine drip.

36:23.719 --> 36:24.619
Or maybe she was struck by

36:24.620 --> 36:25.653
a bolt of lightning. It doesn't

36:25.654 --> 36:26.655
matter. She's dead in our

36:26.656 --> 36:28.692
offices. And when the police

36:28.693 --> 36:29.592
come to investigate, they're

36:29.593 --> 36:30.693
gonna find out you operated on

36:30.694 --> 36:33.062
her against her will.

36:33.063 --> 36:34.296
Why do the police have to

36:34.297 --> 36:34.997
know?

36:34.998 --> 36:36.265
No way, Christian. We're not

36:36.266 --> 36:37.667
going down that road again. This

36:37.668 --> 36:40.303
time we do it by the book.

36:40.304 --> 36:41.671
We have a code blue. Marcy

36:41.672 --> 36:42.772
Hamels flat-lined in recovery.

36:42.773 --> 36:43.506
We know.

36:43.507 --> 36:44.306
Well, why aren't you guys

36:44.307 --> 36:48.243
doing anything? Let's go.

36:48.244 --> 36:51.613
What's going on in here? What

36:51.614 --> 36:53.415
happened to Marcy?

36:53.416 --> 36:55.250
Maybe her numbers were off.

36:55.251 --> 36:56.418
Are you trying to pin this on

36:56.419 --> 36:57.419
me?

36:57.420 --> 36:58.253
Did you know he was operating

36:58.254 --> 36:59.520
on this woman against her will?

36:59.521 --> 37:01.189
No, I did not know. I did not

37:01.190 --> 37:01.956
know at first.

37:01.957 --> 37:02.923
No, but it's not like you

37:02.924 --> 37:04.058
tried to bring her out once you

37:04.059 --> 37:06.961
found out, right?

37:06.962 --> 37:08.128
What are you saying?

37:08.129 --> 37:09.029
What I'm saying is that we're

37:09.030 --> 37:09.830
all in this together.

37:09.831 --> 37:11.432
Together? What did I do?

37:11.433 --> 37:12.799
You? You're McNamara/Troy.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.534
Ok, every little piece of every

37:14.535 --> 37:15.802
little thing is gonna have your

37:15.803 --> 37:16.903
name on it as well. You try

37:16.904 --> 37:18.037
rebuilding your business after

37:18.038 --> 37:19.505
that kind of press. And that's

37:19.506 --> 37:21.641
if we don't go to jail.

37:21.642 --> 37:23.309
What are you suggesting?

37:23.310 --> 37:26.012
I'm suggesting that we take

37:26.013 --> 37:28.681
care of this ourselves. We've

37:28.682 --> 37:31.183
done it before. I mean, who is

37:31.184 --> 37:32.251
this Marcy Hamels anyway? You

37:32.252 --> 37:33.652
know, nobody knows her. She's

37:33.653 --> 37:34.653
got no family, no friends.

37:34.654 --> 37:35.621
No, not again. We've had

37:35.622 --> 37:36.989
Silvio Perez on our backs for

37:36.990 --> 37:37.923
10 years.

37:37.924 --> 37:38.824
We don't have a choice.

37:38.825 --> 37:41.126
You don't have a choice, I do!

37:41.728 --> 37:42.862
And I can do the right thing

37:42.863 --> 37:44.730
here.

37:44.731 --> 37:47.399
Call them. Be a big man. I'm

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
sure you'll make your kids

37:48.401 --> 37:49.235
proud, especially when you can't

37:49.236 --> 37:50.069
afford to pay for their

37:50.070 --> 37:51.237
education anymore. I mean,

37:51.238 --> 37:52.004
conor, he's so young,

37:52.005 --> 37:52.705
he'll only remember you

37:52.706 --> 37:53.605
as the unemployed asshole you're

37:53.606 --> 37:55.107
about to become, but you would

37:55.108 --> 37:56.007
have done the right thing.

37:56.008 --> 38:00.411
That's good.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.148
Fix this.

38:51.662 --> 38:52.795
This is your mess. We should

38:52.796 --> 38:53.629
have brought your car.

38:53.630 --> 38:54.397
Oh, yeah, that's a great

38:54.398 --> 38:55.264
idea. Nobody would notice

38:55.265 --> 38:56.765
a Bordeaux Pontevecchio-colored

38:56.766 --> 38:57.599
Maserati out in the middle of

38:57.600 --> 38:58.532
the desert. Yeah, that wouldn't

38:58.533 --> 39:01.433
draw any attention.

39:02.835 --> 39:04.803
All right, it's deep enough.

39:04.804 --> 39:06.937
Let's get it over with.

39:06.938 --> 39:09.371
Come on.

39:11.207 --> 39:13.341
Put these on. Maybe it'll

39:13.342 --> 39:16.711
keep us from going to the chair.

39:16.712 --> 39:18.779
All right, I got it. Ready?

39:18.780 --> 39:20.381
1, 2, 3.

39:30.057 --> 39:33.392
All right.

39:39.599 --> 39:45.404
Come on, we can't waste any time.

39:45.405 --> 39:49.074
Come on. Let's do it.

41:14.498 --> 41:17.066
Man, I love this shit.

41:17.067 --> 41:18.801
They just don't make them like

41:18.802 --> 41:21.104
they used to.

41:21.105 --> 41:24.040
Do they, Sean?

41:27.845 --> 41:30.847
Man, I love this shit. They

41:30.848 --> 41:35.152
don't make them like they used to.
