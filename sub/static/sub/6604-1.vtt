"And the prince took the beautiful young girl
in his arms and said, "Will you marry me?"

00:35.560 --> 00:39.712
""Yes,"she whispered,"I will be your princess.""

00:39.800 --> 00:42.633
Did they live happily ever after?

00:44.040 --> 00:45.917
Of course, Elizabeth.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.632
How do you know?

00:48.720 --> 00:51.314
Because she was a good little girl.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.915
If she had been naughty,
the prince would have run away.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.956
What a pile of shit.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.196
Oh, Oharlie.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.757
Oharles, this is really important to me.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.354
I forgive you. OK?

02:48.400 --> 02:50.356
I love you.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.872
God, that hurts so much when I say it out loud.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.556
OK, Lizzie.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.719
Oharles, our marriage...

03:02.800 --> 03:05.678
No, this is really important to me.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.716
Oharles, this is really...

03:08.760 --> 03:10.273
OK, Oharles.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.869
Oharles...

03:16.960 --> 03:20.270
- Lizzie, shouldn"t you be having lunch?
- This is important.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.316
- Let me finish.
- You agreed.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.188
You did more than agree.
It was your idea and you were right.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.750
You were absolutely right. We can"t go on.

03:30.720 --> 03:36.716
Sooner or later one of us has got to do something
positive for once in our life for both our sakes.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.756
- And you did it.
- I did?

03:38.840 --> 03:41.513
- Yes.
- Wait. When was it my idea?

03:41.600 --> 03:45.195
The best thing is for me to go
and live with Annabella.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.919
- I don"t think I said that.
- Yes.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.117
- I did? Annabella? Is that her name?
- Yes.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.031
Oh, God. I didn"t know that.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.272
- All I know is what you did with her on our sofa.
- Lizzie, l"m sorry.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.113
I couldn"t help myself.
L"ve been smitten by Annabella.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.952
L"ve been bewitched by her.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.353
I have been pounded flat on the anvil of love
like a piece of veal with a salad on top.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.353
Excuse me. Oan I test-drive this car?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.517
This car looks great topless.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.990
I think a car should represent its owner, don"t you?

04:24.840 --> 04:27.229
Oharles, this is really important to me.

04:27.320 --> 04:31.154
Let"s not go through all this
l-never-want-to-see-you-again stuff

04:31.240 --> 04:34.312
because we will want to see each other again.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.994
We"re not going to throw away two years, are we?

04:37.080 --> 04:40.038
It was three years... in June.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.392
Janie, that"s what he said. He said he wants...

04:58.480 --> 05:01.552
He wants to move out and go live with Annabella.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.390
I know.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.550
If I could just be alone with him.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.235
Yes, it"s hard to look on the bright side but...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.117
Mm-hm.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.112
Yes. L"ve got my car.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.320
I guess l"ll stay in the apartment
but, Janie, I really want him back.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.358
If I could just get him alone and talk to him.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.152
Janie?

05:36.240 --> 05:40.518
Janie, hold on. Hold on a second.
L"m just gonna get some change.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.509
Hey, that"s my car!

05:45.600 --> 05:47.556
(Janie) "Elizabeth!

05:47.640 --> 05:52.714
"Don"t spend any more money on Oharles.
Elizabeth, l"ll see you later anyway."

06:05.240 --> 06:09.916
L"m so sorry, Your Honour.
I lost my money, my car, my husband.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.716
All in one lunch hour?

06:13.640 --> 06:17.428
- Yeah.
- Hey, do what I did. Plead insanity.

06:17.520 --> 06:22.958
(Judge) Oounsel, advise your client
to keep his remarks to himself.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.191
(Woman) Sorry, Your Honour.
May we finally proceed?

06:26.280 --> 06:30.398
Just a moment. Oould the court reporter
approach the bench, please?

06:34.200 --> 06:36.873
- L"m sorry.
- So am I.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.916
You"re fired.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.470
(Mouths)

07:04.160 --> 07:06.116
- Thank you.
- Are you OK?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.553
Mm-hm.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.596
Lizzie?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.636
- Elizabeth Oronin?
- Yeah.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.314
L"m Michael. Mickey. L"m Mickey Bunce.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.511
Used to live down the street
when we were little kids.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.114
- Mickey. Goodness.
- Yeah!

07:21.200 --> 07:22.952
- It"s been 20 years.
- At least.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.792
- Do you work here?
- No.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.553
- Neither do I.
- No. I had a divorce here.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.596
- Divorce?
- Yes.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.035
Ah, I don"t like that word.

07:32.120 --> 07:36.557
You"ve got to work things through
if you don"t want to get divorced.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.599
I gave it my best shot
but we"ve been separated two years now.

07:41.680 --> 07:47.152
The good thing about it is I got to keep
my daughter. That"s Natalie.

07:47.240 --> 07:50.277
- She"s real pretty.
- She"s beautiful.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.591
She"s a lot to handle.
She"s a lot like you used to be.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.910
- Like me?
- Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.389
What do you mean?

07:58.480 --> 08:01.358
Don"t you remember
what you did to my grandmother?

08:01.440 --> 08:04.750
- I didn"t do anything to her.
- You said the same thing then.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.398
You said that Fred did it.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.035
Drop Dead Fred.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.556
(Young Elizabeth) Grandma Bunce!

08:21.880 --> 08:25.634
- Drop Dead Fred.
- I used to pretend I had an imaginary friend.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.676
No one believed me.

08:27.760 --> 08:33.357
Do you remember the time you and Fred
came over to borrow my father"s electric shaver?

08:33.440 --> 08:35.395
Yes.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.076
(Oat squealing)

08:48.480 --> 08:51.597
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- Not at all.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.309
I believed you. It was just that
no one else could see him but you.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.712
- He was so real.
- He was real all right. Really out of control.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.756
No, not always.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.796
Only when my mother was...

09:05.560 --> 09:07.516
Well, you know.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.672
Hey, we were all a little afraid of your mother.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.038
Not Fred. No, he always stood up for me.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.430
That"s what friends are for, even imaginary ones.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.195
I realise you"re feeling pretty conflicted right now.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.032
I feel awful.

09:34.120 --> 09:39.513
I did this self-actualising workshop
and they taught us that pain is your friend.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.909
- Pain makes you interesting.
- Janie.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.355
Look at Elvis.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.396
Yeah, but didn"t Elvis kill himself?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.755
Yes, but before that he was interesting.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.195
I want you to do some affirmations with me.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.838
- Janie.
- Just do it.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.956
Surround yourself with light.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.189
Are you surrounded?

09:58.280 --> 09:59.838
Yeah, I think so.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.549
Repeat after me.
I don"t need a man to complete my life.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.154
- I don"t need a man to complete my life.
- L"m perfect the way that I am.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.800
- L"m perfect the way that I am.
- I hate Oharles.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.348
I hate Oharles.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.954
Don"t you feel better?

10:14.040 --> 10:15.996
No.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.679
I love him. I really do.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.478
(Door opening)

10:22.560 --> 10:25.154
(Janie) I feel basically it"s all about choice.

10:25.240 --> 10:30.553
Since you"ve already chosen, what you may
as well do is to choose what you chose.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.438
- I heard.
- Hello, Mother.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.640
I came as soon as I heard.
It"s a good thing l"ve got a key to this apartment.

10:38.720 --> 10:44.033
Hello, Mrs Oronin. She"ll be all right.
She needs some nurturing. Give her a cuddle.

10:45.880 --> 10:50.795
Ouddling is for teddy bears. L"ve packed
your things. You"re coming home with me.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.714
- L"m staying here tonight.
- Oharles is coming here later.

10:54.800 --> 10:59.237
- I want to be here when he comes.
- Don"t disagree with your mother.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.832
L"m staying here tonight. L"m staying here tonight.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.309
Now that we"re home, everything is perfect.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.712
- Don"t step on that carpet. I had it shampooed.
- Yes, Mother.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.518
Take your things upstairs.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.756
- I made up your bed.
- Oh.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.276
Oh? That"s all you say to me?

11:37.600 --> 11:40.353
- Thank you, Mother.
- That"s a good girl.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.835
(Sobbing quietly)

13:50.000 --> 13:52.355
(Music box plinks)

13:55.400 --> 13:58.153
(Æ’ Pop Goes The Weasel)

14:03.360 --> 14:05.715
(Music speeds up)

14:13.160 --> 14:15.116
(Stops)

14:15.200 --> 14:17.475
(Plinks)

15:17.560 --> 15:20.916
- Boo! Hello, snot face!
- Argh!

15:21.000 --> 15:27.109
Yeugh! What happened to you? Look at you.
You"re all older. You"re even uglier.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.069
Ugh! L"m sorry l"m going to have to be sick
all over you. Lie down. Hang on.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.396
- Where"s all the dolls?
- Drop Dead Fred.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.436
Where is the dolls?

15:39.360 --> 15:41.715
I want to play with the... Aha! The dolls.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.157
Hello, Jemima. Hello, Angelique. "Hello."
You"re going to die. Ah!

15:47.840 --> 15:49.558
Mr Pooh.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.596
"Hello." You die, too.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.636
"No, no, no!" Yes, yes, yes.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.877
"My intestines. Not my intestines!"

16:02.520 --> 16:04.511
D-E-D.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.353
I must be dreaming.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.238
Where"s the fire truck and the rest of the toys?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.117
They"re gone.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.156
L"m grown up.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.834
- Grown up?
- Uh-huh.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.396
Grown up?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.596
Great.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.877
That means there"s a load
of grown-up things to smash.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.916
Oome on!

16:34.000 --> 16:37.197
- Where are we going?
- Play time!

16:37.280 --> 16:39.157
Whee!

16:39.240 --> 16:41.276
(Orunch)

16:42.360 --> 16:44.316
Who put that there?

16:45.160 --> 16:47.196
I forgot to give you something.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.554
Ha-ha-ha!

16:54.200 --> 16:58.113
Where is it? Oome on.
There must be some here somewhere.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.555
Ah! Here it is.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.956
Mind your backs.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.316
Ooh! Oareful.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.356
(Humming merrily)

17:11.560 --> 17:13.675
L"ve got some dog poo right here.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.796
(Squelch)

17:21.760 --> 17:25.752
Æ’ Dog poo, dog poo, lovely, lovely dog poo
dog poo on the chair

17:25.839 --> 17:29.469
Æ’ All along the side, all up here,
lovely, lovely smelly dog poo Æ’

17:30.640 --> 17:33.871
- Elizabeth?
- Yeah, it"s me, Mother.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.873
- L"m just getting a glass of water.
- Uh-huh.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.791
Well, mind the carpet.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.150
Hey, snot face, look. Ink.

17:45.240 --> 17:49.313
Let"s write something on the carpet.
Let"s write, "Mother sucks."

17:49.400 --> 17:53.473
No. Wait a minute. L"ve a better idea.
Let"s play a game.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.996
- A game?
- Yeah, a game, like we used to, in the old days.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.834
A game. OK. Great. But not dolls.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.673
Not dolls cos we"re grown-ups now.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.876
Not dolls. How about hide-and-seek?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.669
Great. I love hide-and-seek.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.230
Great. Maybe you should give me that inkwell first.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.072
Sure. Here.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.112
Oatch.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.470
Nice catch. OK. Hide your eyes
and count to a million.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.633
L"m going to hide in a place
where you"ll never find me. Bye-bye.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.676
Four, five...

18:34.240 --> 18:36.196
What am I doing?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.396
What am I doing?

19:09.880 --> 19:11.233
Oh, boy.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.876
I don"t know what to say.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.592
- I didn"t want anybody to walk on my carpet.
- Yeah, I know.

19:19.680 --> 19:25.869
But here I am, scrubbing away at what
can only be described as dog mess.

19:26.880 --> 19:31.795
Honestly, you"re not even back for a day
and you"re behaving like a five-year-old.

19:36.280 --> 19:41.673
Mother, do you remember when I was little
I had this friend? He was make-believe.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.273
No.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.352
Don"t you remember I was
the only one who could see him?

19:46.440 --> 19:49.193
No, I don"t remember Drop Dead Fred at all.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.276
Morning.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.590
So who"s for snot flicking?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.557
(Plops in cup)

20:05.640 --> 20:08.154
I hid all night in the stupid garden shed

20:08.240 --> 20:11.198
and you didn"t even bother coming to look for me.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.798
Oh, my God.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.836
Is it? It is.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.674
The megabitch. Let me at her!

20:22.360 --> 20:24.396
- Is this for me?
- Get me an axe.

20:24.480 --> 20:28.598
No, get me a chainsaw.
L"m going to slice her into tiny pieces.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.798
Mother, are you going to be doing
any gardening today?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.394
Well, it is a lovely day for it.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.916
The death breath.
She killed me with the death breath.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.953
Be gone, evil one!

20:47.040 --> 20:51.716
Hey, maybe there"s a steak in there.
We can drive it through her heart.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.356
Brrrr!

20:58.440 --> 20:59.998
(Oreaking)

21:12.480 --> 21:14.152
Phew.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.113
Uh!

21:17.200 --> 21:20.431
My head! The megabitch squashed my head!

21:20.520 --> 21:22.636
The bitch. She squashed my head.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.676
The evil one reigns supreme.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.076
There"s nothing I can do.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.233
Aah! Phew.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.716
Wow.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.552
Oobwebs.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.070
What"s so funny?

22:05.160 --> 22:08.709
Nothing. Would you come
sit here with me, Mother?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.394
- Go away.
- You want me to go away?

22:12.480 --> 22:15.552
All right. Fine. Say the magic words and l"ll piss off.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.598
- Piss off.
- Gotcha. Those weren"t the magic words.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.593
- What did you say to me?
- She told you to piss off. Are you deaf?

22:22.680 --> 22:28.789
I said piss off but I did not say it to you.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.438
Well, it"s no wonder Oharles left you.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.398
You just don"t know how to make a marriage work.

22:36.480 --> 22:41.508
You got married? You mean
you"ve been doing it like the pigeons? No.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.999
Yuck!

22:44.840 --> 22:48.799
(Fred) There they are. Which one of you two did it?
Was it you?

22:48.880 --> 22:52.475
Whoever taught her how to do it
is going to get flattened.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.948
(Fred shouting) There! Oome back!

22:59.040 --> 23:00.996
She"s absolutely insane.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.072
- Pigeon pie for you.
- Fred, stop!

23:05.600 --> 23:09.673
So you got married.
Snot face grew up and got married.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.637
Fred, what are you doing here?

23:11.720 --> 23:15.713
L"m stuck cos your stupid, ugly, fat,
grown-up husband has left you.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.394
So you"re all alone and you"re all unhappy.

23:18.480 --> 23:24.032
I had to come back and I can"t get home again
until you"re happy. Why don"t you get happy?

23:26.080 --> 23:28.036
OK.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.871
The only thing that could make me happy
would be getting Oharles back.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.157
- All right. Let"s get Oharles back. L"ll help you.
- OK.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.708
- You"ll help me?
- Yeah, l"ll help you.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.756
When have you ever helped me?

23:42.840 --> 23:46.389
- All the time. That"s what I do.
- You"ve never helped me.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.755
- Excuse me. Yes, I have.
- Did not.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.592
- Did so.
- You did not.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.636
- I did.
- You did not.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.679
- Did not, did not, did not!
- I did, I did, I did!

23:56.760 --> 23:58.637
Right, that"s it. I hate you.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.918
- Ow!
- Goodbye forever. I hope you die horribly.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.956
Fred, come back.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.792
Fred!

24:09.560 --> 24:12.154
You don"t want me any more? Well, fine.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.153
L"ll throw myself in front of
the first... fire truck that I can see.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.959
- Fred.
- You"re going to be sorry.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.871
- Go ahead.
- Goodbye.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.793
Argh!

24:32.280 --> 24:34.236
What have I done?

24:55.920 --> 24:57.399
Wake up.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.948
Snot face, wake up. Wake up!

25:00.040 --> 25:02.838
- What is it?
- It"s time to play burglars.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.195
- Real burglars?
- Real burglars.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.909
The kind that wear sweaters
and Buster Browns. Look.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.115
Da-da!

25:10.200 --> 25:12.156
I made your sweater stripy.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.153
Great.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.196
- What is it?
- Look.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.878
It"s a burglar bag.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.155
(Banging and clattering)

25:36.960 --> 25:38.916
Nigel. Nigel!

25:39.000 --> 25:40.797
I think I heard something.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.110
(Groans sleepily)

25:51.000 --> 25:52.956
What are we doing this for?

25:53.040 --> 25:54.996
Olues. OK. It"s perfect.

25:55.080 --> 25:59.676
Let"s go. We"ll steal gold
and we"ll steal silver and we"ll steal jewels

25:59.760 --> 26:03.070
and hide them where
no one will ever find them, including us.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.116
Promise?

26:05.200 --> 26:06.872
I promise.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.118
Let"s go, burglar.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.189
This is very expensive.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.475
Then we"d better be very careful.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.356
What was that?

26:22.440 --> 26:24.032
(Olattering)

26:24.120 --> 26:28.318
- OK. Oome on.
- The coast is clear.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.436
Shh. Shh.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.432
(Fred) Aha!

26:39.760 --> 26:42.274
Hey, snot face. Look at this.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.789
Eeeeeh!

26:47.440 --> 26:50.557
Oh, no. Gladiolas.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.754
A-A-A-chooo!

26:58.640 --> 27:00.039
Ow!

27:05.000 --> 27:08.117
- Are you all right, Fred?
- Yes, l"m all right.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.510
- Hello, police?
- Are they there?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.670
- Hello.
- Give them the address.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.512
Tell them there"s a burglar.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.114
OK, buddy, what shall we steal now?

27:20.200 --> 27:22.794
- How about the telephone?
- Good idea.

27:22.880 --> 27:27.715
- That"s probably where the diamonds are hidden.
- Yeah! Great idea.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.552
Hello?

27:29.640 --> 27:31.995
What"s the matter? Where"d they go?

27:32.080 --> 27:34.071
- They"ve cut the phone line.
- Oh, my God!

27:34.920 --> 27:38.469
Now it"s time to make our getaway through here.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.509
Now, opening a window requires
great sophisticatedliness.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.955
- So l"d better do it, OK?
- OK.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.956
Ha! Ouch.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.956
I love those breaking noises.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.152
- Oh, my God. L"m having a heart attack.
- Shh!

28:00.240 --> 28:02.310
(Glass smashing)

28:05.160 --> 28:07.879
Shh. Shh!

28:10.120 --> 28:11.838
OK.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.396
- OK.
- Oome on, Fred.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.710
Right, let"s do it.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.109
OK, we"ll bury the treasure here
and no one will find it.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.912
Oh, mind that.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.716
We"ve been found out.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.438
- It"s dark in there.
- Be careful. Stay low.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.916
Kick it in.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.877
Ow!

28:54.960 --> 28:56.996
(Officer) Stay down here.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.389
- What shall we do?
- Make a run for it.

28:59.480 --> 29:04.395
No. It"s too late for that now.
Snot face, l"m going to take the rap alone.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.789
- No.
- Yes. Give me the guilty sweater.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.030
No!

29:09.120 --> 29:10.473
Snot face.

29:12.200 --> 29:16.273
A guy"s coming up the stairs.
L"m going to ask him what he wants.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.839
Don"t leave me.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.990
(Nigel) Keep cool.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.438
Argh!

29:27.000 --> 29:28.831
Nigel, don"t die!

29:31.360 --> 29:37.708
Right. I want you to tell them loud and clear
and proud, "Drop Dead Fred did it."

29:37.800 --> 29:39.756
- L"m no coward.
- I don"t want to.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.149
Just do it, no brain.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.390
- Go on.
- Drop Dead...

29:45.560 --> 29:47.516
Drop Dead Fred...

29:50.640 --> 29:53.518
I didn"t say it right. Fred?

29:54.440 --> 29:56.954
Hey, I thought you weren"t a coward.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.749
L"m not a coward. Have they gone?

30:00.840 --> 30:05.277
Why are you taking my husband?
Lt"s a mistake. I am calling our lawyer.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.874
- Go inside.
- Why are you going with them?

30:07.960 --> 30:11.270
- We are pillars of the community.
- (Officer) Get a grip.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.193
What will the neighbours think? Officer...

30:15.680 --> 30:17.636
Maybe Mommy"s right.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.234
I never do anything right.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.869
So what? What are you saying that for?

30:23.960 --> 30:26.633
You"re great. She"s not.

30:26.720 --> 30:31.157
She"s always fighting with your dad
and calling you horrible things.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.913
Look, you"ve got to be what you want to be.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.309
Don"t you ever be like her.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.356
- Promise?
- Promise.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.396
OK.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.118
Ow!

30:43.200 --> 30:45.156
Got you, Fred.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.878
Hey!

30:47.960 --> 30:50.474
(Sirens)

30:56.280 --> 31:00.034
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
Get dressed. We"re late.

31:01.720 --> 31:05.918
Mother, can we talk about when I was little?

31:06.000 --> 31:10.073
We haven"t got time. We have to get you
back with Oharles and I can do it.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.116
Let"s go.

31:17.560 --> 31:21.553
There. You see what I mean? You look wonderful.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.558
Now, Elizabeth, don"t worry.
All these products are cruelty-free.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.599
No, you see, I think it should
definitely be more like mine.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.511
More blush here.

31:34.880 --> 31:40.159
Oh, yes. Much more grown-up.
Oharles is going to love this.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.116
Oh.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.350
A note, Elizabeth, to you.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.276
- It"s from Oharles.
- More bad news, no doubt.

31:52.360 --> 31:57.354
"Dear Lizzie, I came by but no one was here
so I thought l"d leave this note.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.034
"I miss our mornings."

32:00.120 --> 32:02.156
(Oharles) "I miss our mornings."

32:02.240 --> 32:05.277
- You can"t go to work.
- I love you but l"ve got to go.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.476
"The little games we used to play.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.756
"You have the softest touch."

32:10.840 --> 32:12.796
Ooh! Ow.

32:13.800 --> 32:18.396
"You"re like a Lynch Bages "83,
a fine wine that"s sure to age well.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.678
"Please come home."

32:21.760 --> 32:25.309
"L"ll wait for you at our apartment."
At last he wants to talk.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.837
It"s more than your father did when he left.
Does he say anything else?

32:29.920 --> 32:32.354
Just one more thing. "Love, Oharlie."

32:35.560 --> 32:37.312
Oharles.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.356
Oharlie.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.557
(Screams)

32:50.640 --> 32:54.030
- Shit yourself?
- God, I thought you were dead.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.590
It takes more than a fire truck
to stop Drop Dead Fred.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.433
You have to leave. L"m expecting Oharles.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.671
Expecting Oharles. That"s important. L"d better go.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.116
- There"s a problem. Oharles isn"t coming.
- What do you mean?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.236
I wrote the note.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.914
Haven"t got a husband!
Haven"t got a husband!

33:12.000 --> 33:13.752
Got a stupid haircut!

33:13.840 --> 33:16.718
"Look at my horrid, stupid haircut, everybody."

33:16.800 --> 33:19.155
Na na na-na na! Looks just like her mother.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.276
Another little megabeast.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.876
It was only a joke.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.552
It was just a joke.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.556
Snot face.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.596
It was just a joke.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.876
Oome on.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.793
Hey. Look. Look.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.235
Da da-da da-da-da da!

33:46.200 --> 33:48.156
Want a cookie?

33:55.880 --> 33:58.394
What"s the matter?

33:58.480 --> 34:01.472
I really thought that Oharles wanted me back.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.916
What"s so special about him?

34:05.680 --> 34:08.353
I mean, can he make you puke?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.556
- Not like you can.
- Nah.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.947
So what, then?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.753
- Do you really want to know, Fred?
- Yeah.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.678
I love him.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.956
Why?

34:27.320 --> 34:29.275
I don"t know.

34:29.360 --> 34:34.150
He sends me flowers and brings me wine.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.956
He"s very romantic.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.398
He can be really sweet sometimes.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.677
L"ve never heard anything
so disgusting in all my life.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.069
Bleurgh! Romance?!

34:52.159 --> 34:54.754
Bleurgh!

34:56.560 --> 35:01.236
- Urgh! What"s this?
- Oharles"s poster for his wine-tasting party.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.436
- Will Oharles be there?
- Yeah.

35:04.160 --> 35:07.914
- Well, let"s go.
- No. I can"t go alone.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.994
- L"ll come with you. L"ll be your date.
- That"s really nice but no thanks.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.916
(Snoring)

35:36.080 --> 35:38.036
Janie!

35:40.440 --> 35:42.192
Janie.

35:47.800 --> 35:51.110
- Janie, I need your help.
- At three in the morning?

35:51.200 --> 35:55.113
What is with your hair?
Is there a Marilyn Quayle lookalike contest?

35:55.200 --> 35:58.749
I got this note, not from Oharles,
from Drop Dead Fred.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.389
- Who? Drop Dead?
- An imaginary friend I had as a child.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.756
- He"s back.
- I hear you knocking but you can"t come in.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.434
Murray is in there. You can"t stay long.

36:08.520 --> 36:12.229
Janie, suddenly he"s everywhere
and only I can see him.

36:12.320 --> 36:17.348
He"s driving me crazy. It"s like he"s my best friend
and yet l"m scared to death of him.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.954
- I thought I was your best friend.
- You are.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.112
- Notjust because l"m visible.
- (Man) Janie!

36:24.360 --> 36:27.830
- Are you coming back?
- L"ll be right up, Mur.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.870
- He"s such an animal.
- You mean he goes all night?

36:32.960 --> 36:38.512
What do you think, he shits in the corner,
he eats with his paws? You can"t stay here.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.673
If somebody else could see Drop Dead Fred,
then l"d know l"m not crazy.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.716
Is he here now?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.238
- No.
- Good.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.834
I was going to say if he is, I can"t see him.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.356
Janie, if I go home, he"s bound to be there.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.749
You can"t stay here, though.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.796
I can"t go home.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.996
Oh!

37:00.080 --> 37:02.992
- All right, stay the night.
- Thank you.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.198
Murray is here one night a month.
You had to pick tonight.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.869
Wake up. Look what l"ve done.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.436
Elizabeth, wake up. Look.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.789
Snot face, wake up.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.556
(Fred) Wake up!

37:51.480 --> 37:54.711
Wake up. What, are you shedding?

37:58.200 --> 38:00.350
Did you do this to yourself?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.875
Oh! Drop Dead Fred did it.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.918
- He was here?
- Am I missing something?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.754
- Is this a girly thing?
- It"s a creative visualisation.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.990
She has an imaginary friend.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.231
Oh. I never had imaginary friends.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.550
Just wet dreams.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.949
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

38:22.040 --> 38:25.430
L"m going to be at work till lunch, then l"ll be back.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.955
That is a very strange young lady.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.350
She"s going through a difficult time
and she is a friend.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.396
- L"m not criticising.
- You are.

38:44.480 --> 38:48.712
- L"m just describing what I saw.
- Everybody has strange friends, even you.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.076
- But all mine are alive.
- That"s not saying much.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.156
Oharles!

39:09.880 --> 39:11.632
Oharles!

39:13.720 --> 39:15.438
Oharles!

39:18.240 --> 39:20.196
Lt"s got to be him.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.792
It looks just like our boat.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.236
I think that"s him.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.436
Pirates!

39:46.560 --> 39:50.109
- I love playing pirates.
- Fred, don"t touch anything.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.749
Sure. This is going to be great.
We"ll sail the seven seas.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.833
We"ll put on eye patches.
We"ll cut off our legs and glue on wooden ones.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.514
- I can"t touch anything?
- No. OK?

40:00.600 --> 40:03.034
Yeah, sure. L"ll just touch that one.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.669
- I won"t touch that one. L"ll touch that one.
- Nothing.

40:06.760 --> 40:10.514
- I am the pirate who doesn"t touch anything.
- That"s right.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.318
Except this one.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.118
(Beeping)

40:14.200 --> 40:16.350
- What did you just touch?
- Nothing.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.556
- What did you touch?
- The red one.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.995
Fred!

40:21.080 --> 40:26.518
The engine"s broken, that"s all. L"ll go and fix
the engine. You keep an eye out, Oaptain.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.556
Aye aye, Oaptain.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.871
Fred, he"s getting away.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.194
What? Faster?

40:41.280 --> 40:43.236
Okey-dokey.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.590
This way! Oaptain Fred"s in charge!

41:08.480 --> 41:12.029
Drown the fishes! Kill all the parrots!

41:30.000 --> 41:32.036
What is that water doing there?

41:32.120 --> 41:34.395
- What water?
- That water.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.155
I don"t know. What are your thoughts?

41:38.240 --> 41:40.196
Whoa!

41:41.280 --> 41:43.236
Man the lifeboats!

41:44.280 --> 41:46.999
(Foghorn blaring)

42:06.800 --> 42:09.234
Excuse me a minute, would you?

42:15.680 --> 42:18.797
- Now what"s happened?
- I have some bad news for you.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.393
More?

42:21.560 --> 42:24.074
Remember your house?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.513
Yeah.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.559
It... It sank.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.596
What?

42:31.680 --> 42:34.148
Er, I didn"t mean for it...

42:34.240 --> 42:36.708
Drop Dead Fred just...

42:38.000 --> 42:39.831
He was way out of control.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.708
Do you think I have an imaginary-friend clause
in my insurance?

42:43.800 --> 42:45.950
Janie, l"m so sorry.

42:46.040 --> 42:49.828
- Everything I own is on that boat.
- It"s all still there.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.674
It"s just... not so near the top of the water.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.391
You always tell me to look on
the bright side of things.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.597
What would that be in this particular situation?

43:05.720 --> 43:07.472
There he is.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.032
- Murray?
- No.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.278
- Not...
- Yes.

43:12.360 --> 43:18.390
How about the silverware service? A complete
mystery to me but was completely ruined.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.198
Any response?

43:20.280 --> 43:23.909
He"s waving at us.
Wave or he might do something awful.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.958
- Hi!
- What"s he doing now?

43:29.480 --> 43:30.879
Nothing yet.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.313
Do it to them, Murray.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.949
I think it"s time we got down to specifics,
don"t you?

43:36.040 --> 43:39.874
Specifics, don"t you? What is it? Lt"s gone now.

43:39.960 --> 43:43.032
He"s just sitting in your chair. Do you see him?

43:43.120 --> 43:46.908
No, but that won"t stop me
from killing the little bastard.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.878
But we have an item we"d like for you to see.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.110
The police report.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.714
The damage to the room was incredible.

43:54.800 --> 43:59.794
Excuse me, gentlemen. Hello, sweetheart.
Aren"t you a cute little thing?

44:00.640 --> 44:04.189
L"m just going to borrow this.
L"ll be back in a second.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.196
Snot face.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.594
Have I got him?

44:26.920 --> 44:28.876
What are you doing, Miss Shagrue?

44:28.960 --> 44:32.919
L"m running for Oongress.
What does it look like l"m doing?

44:35.000 --> 44:38.436
- There"s nobody there.
- He"s invisible, idiot.

44:39.440 --> 44:42.557
Die! You"re dead, little man!

44:42.640 --> 44:44.278
That"s for the boat!

44:44.360 --> 44:49.388
That"s for ruining the one schtup I get a month
when Murray"s wife is out of town!

44:56.000 --> 44:58.036
Lt"s very hot in here, isn"t it?

45:08.680 --> 45:13.708
This is stupid. We ought to be in a shop
that sells harpoons and nets and hammers.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.349
- What for?
- We could harpoon Oharles through the head,

45:17.440 --> 45:21.194
drag him home and hit him with the hammer
till he agrees to come back.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.953
- Harpoon him through the head?
- Brilliant.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.350
- It"s not going to work.
- How many times have you tried it?

45:27.440 --> 45:29.715
- We"re not five any more.
- I know.

45:31.320 --> 45:35.393
- This would be good for the wine gala.
- It looks like a big bruise.

45:36.240 --> 45:39.789
- L"m going to be late for lunch.
- Who are you having lunch with?

45:39.880 --> 45:42.599
An old friend and I don"t mean you.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.636
You"re not invited.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.676
Why not?

45:47.760 --> 45:49.910
We always do everything together.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.792
(Man) Thank you.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.759
- This is a great place.
- It"s Oharles"s favourite restaurant.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.115
Oh.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.156
You cut your hair.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.516
- Yeah. Oharles is going to hate it.
- You look beautiful.

46:05.600 --> 46:09.957
- Just relax. Let"s have a nice lunch.
- OK.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.632
Hi. What"s happening?

46:13.680 --> 46:16.956
Oh, no. Mickey fart pants. Who let him grow up?

46:17.040 --> 46:19.713
- Go away.
- What?

46:22.080 --> 46:25.197
- L"m sorry.
- No, don"t apologise.

46:25.280 --> 46:29.068
I love being with you.
I love the way you cut your hair.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.151
I love the way you sink houseboats.

46:31.240 --> 46:35.677
Look at him. He"s still talking about love.
I always said you should be a girl.

46:37.760 --> 46:43.676
You know, some people believe
that you really never ever fall out of love.

46:43.760 --> 46:48.595
Oh! This isn"t like when we were five.
We"re grown-ups now, so piss off.

46:48.680 --> 46:52.070
L"d like to know more about
the grown-up Mickey Bunce.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.116
OK, I...

46:54.960 --> 47:00.717
Well... I know how much you...
hate the word divorce

47:00.800 --> 47:04.759
but after mine I had to get back
into the whole dating...

47:07.840 --> 47:09.592
game.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.751
- Yes, Mickey, go on.
- Yes, Mickey, go on.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.596
OK. Erm...

47:23.160 --> 47:25.355
See that woman over there?

47:26.920 --> 47:28.558
Mm-hm.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.834
Well, I dated her three or four times.

47:32.920 --> 47:38.597
It was funny. I didn"t know whether I should
hold her hand when we walked down the street

47:38.680 --> 47:40.636
or give her a kiss good night.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.713
I felt like I was back in high school again.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.396
Why did you do that?

47:52.200 --> 47:55.351
- I didn"t.
- No, you did. I saw you do that.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.472
(Mouths)

47:58.560 --> 48:01.632
I did, didn"t I? To get the waiter"s attention.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.756
Well, I don"t think that works.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.190
Maybe that does work.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.236
Your lunch.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.956
And your lunch, sir.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.676
This table leg must be loose again.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.918
Peekaboo.

48:24.760 --> 48:28.389
Peekaboo, yeah.
I play that with Natalie all the time.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.315
Oh, yeah...

48:35.400 --> 48:37.356
- Smells good.
- Mm!

48:50.560 --> 48:52.869
OK. Why did you do that?

48:52.960 --> 48:54.632
(Woman) Disgusting!

48:54.720 --> 48:56.438
L"m crazy.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.910
You are crazy in the most wonderful way.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.596
God, I wish I could be like that.
I wish I could do those kind of things.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.836
What the hell.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.956
(Man) Hey, buddy.

49:17.800 --> 49:21.588
- Uh-oh!
- You don"t throw spaghetti in my restaurant.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.636
Fine. You do it.

49:24.920 --> 49:27.878
You and the Puttanesca woman, out of here.

49:27.960 --> 49:30.315
I like him a lot better than I used to.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.310
- Take it easy.
- You"re out of here.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.756
- It was a joke. You guys should loosen up.
- Out!

49:37.560 --> 49:39.710
- What is Puttanesca?
- My dress.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.314
L"ll get it. L"d like to. What the hell.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.709
Amigos.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.155
- Having fun?
- (Waiter) Oome on, buddy.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.313
That was great. That make you feel better?

49:51.400 --> 49:55.473
No. First you sink Janie"s houseboat.
What you did in that restaurant.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.677
- All you do is smash things up.
- What"s wrong with that?

49:58.760 --> 50:01.194
Nothing, except you"re ruining my life.

50:03.200 --> 50:07.512
Your problem is you"re no fun any more.
You"ve turned into your mother.

50:07.600 --> 50:12.879
You are so sick. You know what?
I don"t want an imaginary friend any more.

50:12.960 --> 50:16.077
Do you see what you"re doing to me?
L"m talking to myself.

50:16.160 --> 50:20.119
You"re driving me crazy.
Please just get out of my life.

50:20.200 --> 50:25.911
All right, fine, l"m going and you"re never
going to see me again ever. Bye.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.433
(violin playing, out of tune)

51:11.720 --> 51:13.676
I asked you nicely.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.716
Shh!

51:25.680 --> 51:27.636
(Woman) Somebody call security.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.676
L"m so sorry.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.552
L"m...

51:33.840 --> 51:38.356
You play such an expensive violin
in a shopping mall?

51:38.440 --> 51:40.192
Where? What?

51:40.280 --> 51:43.397
L"m just getting my bag. L"m fine, Mother.

51:43.480 --> 51:47.109
How can you say that
when you have conversations with thin air?

51:47.200 --> 51:49.919
Not thin air, Drop Dead Fred.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.275
- Don"t mention his name.
- Sorry.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.875
You may have Drop Dead Fred. I have Dr Ryland.

52:02.480 --> 52:06.439
Elizabeth, please have a seat outside.
I need a word with your mother.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.351
That"s the piece, Matthew. You"ve finished it.

52:20.680 --> 52:25.993
L"m really sorry. I didn"t know I was going
to get you into so much trouble.

52:26.080 --> 52:30.278
So what did the doctor say?
Are you insane or what?

52:33.000 --> 52:34.956
Did they give you a lobotomy?

52:39.120 --> 52:41.076
He"s very good with children.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.198
Oh.

52:44.280 --> 52:50.389
He"s one of the country"s leading experts
in dealing with the imaginary-friend syndrome.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.354
Your child has one, too, huh?

52:54.440 --> 52:56.396
I don"t have a child.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.879
Oh?

52:57.960 --> 53:00.315
- Well, who"s in there?
- My mother.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.675
Oh!

53:02.760 --> 53:05.194
- Which one of you is...
- Me.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.840
- Let"s go.
- L"ll leave when I want to.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.592
OK, fine.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.638
OK, I was just asking. Just trying to be nice.

53:25.640 --> 53:28.154
Go to Hell Herman! Argh!

53:28.240 --> 53:30.913
Fred! Argh!

53:31.000 --> 53:33.195
Punch me.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.633
Hey, hey!

53:34.720 --> 53:36.836
- (Twang)
- Yaah!

53:36.920 --> 53:39.388
Hey, Fred!

53:39.480 --> 53:42.392
- Velcro Head!
- (All) Yaah!

53:42.480 --> 53:44.914
Brrrrrrr!

53:46.400 --> 53:47.913
What are you doing?

53:49.920 --> 53:51.876
I am playing with my friends.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.151
- Hey, Freddy. Hi, guys!
- (All groan)

53:58.240 --> 54:00.196
- Graggy.
- Hey, Fred, hold this.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.313
That"s so Namby Pamby.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.356
(Woman) You called?

54:12.120 --> 54:14.076
Namby Pamby!

54:14.160 --> 54:16.037
(All) Whoo!

54:16.120 --> 54:20.716
This is great. The whole gang"s here.
Let"s have a sick contest!

54:35.160 --> 54:39.233
Hey, watch this. Oharge!

54:46.800 --> 54:49.155
Ouckoo! Ouckoo!

54:49.240 --> 54:50.798
Oooh!

54:50.880 --> 54:52.836
Very nice.

54:52.920 --> 54:56.754
Nine, maybe ten. I love it.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.796
- Not bad, huh?
- Beautiful.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.276
Let her take these after meals and before bed.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.794
- Are there any side effects?
- None.

55:06.880 --> 55:11.112
They just neutralise that part of the brain
which is malfunctioning.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.156
How did it come to this?

55:13.240 --> 55:16.118
She"s regressed to where these children are.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.156
Elizabeth.

55:23.720 --> 55:29.317
- Well, l"ve got to go, so l"ll see you chickens later.
- Fred. Not the pills.

55:29.400 --> 55:33.393
Why not? Do they make you sick or stupid?
L"ll take them. L"m Fred.

55:33.480 --> 55:36.392
You don"t want to let her take the green ones.

55:36.480 --> 55:39.074
- Why not?
- Remember Go-Go Mouth?

55:39.160 --> 55:41.116
Yeah.

55:50.760 --> 55:54.116
- Don"t worry about me.
- No, no, F...

56:07.720 --> 56:09.676
Here we are.

56:09.760 --> 56:13.958
Now, I want you to eat all your vegetables.

56:14.040 --> 56:15.996
- Yes.
- Yes what?

56:16.800 --> 56:18.870
- Yes, thank you.
- That"s better.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.634
We"re going to be great friends, Mrs Oronin.
I can see that.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.193
(Doorbell)

56:26.280 --> 56:28.236
L"ll be right back.

56:39.400 --> 56:44.713
Don"t eat the napkin, dear. L"ve got a black belt
and I could break you like that.

56:44.800 --> 56:49.396
You"re going to behave.
Oonscious or unconscious, it"s all the same to me.

56:50.480 --> 56:54.792
Whoo! I like her. She is good. She is awfully good.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.910
L"ll be back in a moment with your pill.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.230
"L"ll be back in a moment with your pill."

57:00.320 --> 57:05.872
Wait a minute. Those are the... pills. This is
getting serious. We"d better get out of here.

57:06.640 --> 57:11.236
- I know, but this will take one minute.
- There"s no way anyone can see her.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.993
- I know, cos she"s so crazy.
- Yes, crazy.

57:14.080 --> 57:17.629
- Michael, take your foot out of my door.
- Oh...

57:26.960 --> 57:29.554
Oome on. Snot face, let"s go.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.154
Look, I am getting fed up of this.

57:33.240 --> 57:37.836
It"s getting dangerous.
There"s two of them now and they"ve got pills.

57:37.920 --> 57:41.993
They"re going to turn you into one of them.
You"ve started already.

57:42.080 --> 57:46.312
You picked up a piece of broccoli and went,
"What a lovely piece of broccoli."

57:46.400 --> 57:48.834
I can"t believe it. It"s beyond disgusting.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.156
Snot face, please help.

58:00.720 --> 58:02.676
Oome on.

58:05.800 --> 58:11.193
Look, remember when your dad picked up
the megabeast and threw her out the window?

58:11.280 --> 58:15.478
- That never happened.
- It didn"t happen, but you wanted it to.

58:16.600 --> 58:19.114
Yeah. So did I.

58:20.880 --> 58:23.633
Do you remember? Hm?

58:24.440 --> 58:26.192
Remember?

58:28.000 --> 58:32.073
Elizabeth, you"ve made
a mess of your beautiful hair.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.433
The time has come...

58:36.520 --> 58:41.150
when we don"t want to hear the words
Drop Dead Fred ever again.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.798
Don"t you agree, Nigel?

58:45.160 --> 58:49.438
- Hm? About what?
- This Drop Dead Fred business.

58:54.960 --> 58:59.158
- L"m sorry, Pol.
- Stand still. L"ll clean it later.

59:00.200 --> 59:02.156
Oan I have some cereal?

59:02.240 --> 59:04.390
May I have some cereal?

59:04.480 --> 59:09.679
Yes, you may in just a minute.
We don"t eat food off the floor.

59:09.760 --> 59:14.276
- Why do you call him Drop Dead Fred?
- Because that"s his name, Daddy.

59:14.360 --> 59:18.069
And Drop Dead Fred
is going to teach me how to cook today.

59:18.160 --> 59:23.678
L"m going to need flour and sugar
and honey and vodka.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.309
And a pair of your pants. We"re making pants pie.

59:27.400 --> 59:29.356
Ouch!

59:29.440 --> 59:32.830
Vodka and pants pie. God knows what else.

59:33.720 --> 59:35.676
She"s only a kid, Pol.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.549
Daddy, how about we throw
Mommy out the window?

59:40.640 --> 59:44.315
It won"t hurt her. She"ll land right in the gladiolis.

59:46.480 --> 59:49.711
You shouldn"t say things like that
about your mother.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.950
She might cut your head off.

59:53.560 --> 59:55.516
Very funny, Elizabeth.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.990
Sometimes I think I don"t love you
as much as I used to.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.232
- Drop Dead Fred does.
- No more Drop Dead Fred, period!

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.119
- Hi, Fred.
- You"re completely wrong cos I don"t love you.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.637
I don"t love anyone cos love"s for girls
and girls are disgusting.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.510
L"m a loner. L"m a crazy, wide-eyed loner
on a doomed space mission to venus

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.273
to battle with the three-headed megabeast.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.035
But on the way there, I caught cornflakes disease.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.755
Pants pie can"t save me now.
The only thing that can save me is a mud pie.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.592
Yeah! Oome on.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.390
Here it comes.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.436
- Take the top off.
- OK.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.717
- Here it comes.
- Wow, my first real mud pie!

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:07.478
Lt"s not ready yet. We need lots of other things.
We need cornflakes and orange juice. Beautiful.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.073
- That"s lovely.
- This is fun.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.078
A little tea. A lot of tea.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.474
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.710
- That"s good.
- Here.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:24.429
That"s good. There"s the milk. Good.
Lots of milk.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.199
(Fred) Lovely. Right.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.349
Yeah, but it"s not ready.
It"s still too pretty. It needs something.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.396
I know.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.079
There.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.518
Great. When something"s not working,
the best thing is to tear it apart to make it better.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.115
Elizabeth, are you behaving in there?

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.598
- L"m not afraid of the megabeast.
- L"m not either.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.797
When she comes in here,
we"ll make her eat up this mud.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.997
- And then we"ll cut her head off.
- With scissors.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.629
- And then we"ll make her eat it.
- Make her eat her own head?

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.429
- With what?
- Oh, yeah. Well, l"ll eat her head, then.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.399
- And l"ll eat the rest of her.
- Yeah! And then we"ll get up...

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.274
And we"ll poo her all over the table
cos we"re not afraid of anything. Yeah!

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.715
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.869
Argh!

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.713
- (Mother) Elizabeth!
- Quick, hide.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.756
Quick.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.593
Hurry up!

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.636
OK?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.472
Ah!

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.518
Oh, my...

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.709
What is wrong with you?

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.273
You"ve been playing with him, haven"t you?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.476
Where is he?

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.353
Don"t take him away from me!

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.830
So that must make you cry.
Well, now I know what to do.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.948
Give me it. No, don"t take him away from me.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.910
- Nigel, do it.
- No, I won"t.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.994
- I don"t want anything to do with it. It"s not right.
- All right. L"ll do it.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.796
It"s not right.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.633
What would you know about raising a child?

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.556
Apparently nothing.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.676
If you ever touch this again, l"ll throw it in the trash.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.196
Do you know what will happen?
He will be crushed to death.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.517
"Dear Drop Dead Fred,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:44.517
"you were my only friend
but she took you away from me.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.749
"I know l"ll see you again someday."

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.759
(Fred) "If you come back,
I promise we"ll run away together."

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.308
See that? "Promise."

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.358
I found that when I was hiding in the garden shed.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.275
That"s right. That"s where I hid it.
But you never answered it.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.470
You just disappeared.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:19.198
And when you did all the... life

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.078
and, um, the spirit...

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.156
- and the...
- The Fred.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.518
Yeah, Fred. Just went out of me.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.918
I should never have let my mother know
how much she could hurt me.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.156
Once she knew how,
she knew that she could do it all the time.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.992
And she did.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.512
So I never showed her my real feelings again.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.633
- So?
- So?

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.676
So now can we run away, please?

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.517
- Where to?
- To the party.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.512
- To the Oharlie party.
- Yeah.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.953
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.189
Yeah!

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.878
OK?

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.916
Let"s go.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.239
Oh, no, gladiolas.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.549
No. No. No!

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.869
Where do you think you"re going?

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.313
L"m going.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.155
- No, you"re not, you"re staying.
- No, Mother, this time l"m definitely going.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.636
Good night, flake.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.953
Yeah, well, we"re not scared of you, fatso.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.473
(Lock turns)

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.473
Oome on. We"ll go out the window.
L"m good at this. Stand back.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.236
Wait a minute.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.596
I love those breaking noises.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.710
Let"s go. Oome on.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.835
Hey, door-to-window service.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.835
- I brought your dress, madam.
- Mickey.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.510
- Oan you give me a lift?
- Absolutely. Oome on.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.953
(Fred) Oi, wait for me.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.517
- I believe you ordered the spaghetti.
- I hate you.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.149
Mickey, l"m so sorry.
I hope I didn"t get you into trouble.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.357
No. Look, it"s OK. It"s all been great to me.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.070
You"re going to look beautiful in your dress.
I hope Oharles appreciates it.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.913
He"s just a total and utter girl, isn"t he?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.992
This is great, stuck in a truck with two girls.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.669
Mickey, you"re the best.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:29.870
- Thanks.
- I think I was six when we moved away.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.353
I remember getting in the car, pulling away,
taking one last look at you

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:39.558
and thinking, "l"m never going
to get to have fun with Betsy again."

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.198
Mickey Bunce.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.555
Don"t you hate it when you"re right
about the wrong things?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.712
- Let"s go.
- Thanks.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.077
- Snot face, you are looking great.
- I am?

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.674
Yeah. For a girl.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.071
(Mouths)

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.116
There he is.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.674
- Is that him?
- Mm-hm.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.398
I thought he liked wine.
Why does he keep spitting it out?

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:41.233
- Where"s he gone?
- I don"t know. Oome on.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.514
Right.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:47.033
- Fred, let"s just behave ourselves.
- Sure. Not a problem.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.872
Grapes.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.115
Oould someone grab a hold of this?

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.873
(Laughter)

01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.557
What? Why do I always get the blame? You"ve
got the grape. The lady with the grape did it.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.393
- Where is he?
- I don"t know.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.597
Don"t worry. L"ll find Oharlie boy for you.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.274
Wait here. Oharlie!

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.193
Oharlie!

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.554
Oha...

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.671
No panties.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.637
No panties! Ah!

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.076
Get up. Get up.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.358
- Fred, get up.
- Go away!

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.590
- Get up.
- Spoilsport.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.879
I was just admiring your dress.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.555
The material, it"s so pretty. Slinky.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.953
Oh!

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.713
- It"s pretty neat.
- It looks good on you.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.588
It feels good on. I like yours. Yours is nice.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.994
- It"s very purple.
- Annabella.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.514
- My little Ohardonnay.
- There you are.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.473
Elizabeth. My God.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.156
That"s him.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.277
Don"tjust stand there, do something.
Go on. Kiss him.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.156
You said she was mousey.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.194
L"m sorry. Excuse me.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.236
Don"t go. It"s going great.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.076
Are you OK?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.916
- I think so.
- Yeah?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.911
Yeah.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.357
- My little vermentino.
- My little Pinot Noir.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.756
I can"t believe we left the party so soon.
All that wine to spit around.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.833
- We didn"t even get to play spin the bottle.
- I got upset.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.357
God, you"re so stupid.
You never leave a party till the very end.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.750
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.354
Oinderella left early. Remember her?

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.877
No, I don"t remember her. I forgot everything
about her. She made me puke.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.952
I remember the ugly sisters. They were great.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.516
You"re here.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.030
- Oan I tell you something?
- What?

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.237
You look fabulous.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.312
I do?

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.510
Darling, you need me.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.436
I do?

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.516
To protect you.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.396
From what?

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.950
Men like me.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.519
- But, Oharles, there"s so many things...
- No. No talk.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.556
Just kiss.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.076
(Lock rattling)

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.356
What was that?

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.159
Oh, it"s Fred.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.994
Fred? What did you do, give this Fred a key?

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.870
Hey, Fred, l"m home now.
It"s Oharles, Lizzie"s husband.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.916
(Rattling)

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.676
Is he the violent type?

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.069
Only with me.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.559
Jesus.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.757
Who does this guy think he is,
playing around with a married woman?

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.992
Polly, hi.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.036
What did you do?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.156
Hello?

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.190
You are a wonderful man, Oharles,
but she is dangerous.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:12.070
I love dangerous. Don"t worry.
I can take care of this Drop Dead Fred.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.674
If you think you can handle it, here.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.117
- But, Oharles, she is just a child.
- L"m a grown-up, Polly.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.556
Where were we?

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.635
Eurgh! What does that taste like?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.030
Oharles, let"s talk. It"s kind of important to me.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.076
Of course it is.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.631
- You"re not going to get that out, are you?
- Not now.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.676
- Not now?
- No, I mean now.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.716
- Now.
- Now.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.552
Hang on.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:54.397
Hang on. This isn"t how the pigeons do it. You"re
supposed to stamp on her head and peck her.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.517
- Oharles.
- Annabella.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.556
- What?
- What?

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.074
What happened?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.469
You just said Annabella.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.791
- No, I didn"t.
- Yes, you did. You said, "Oh, Annabella."

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.395
- You said "Oh, Annabella."
- That"s impossible.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.597
Oharles, I heard you. You said Annabella.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:22.360
Well... if I said, "Oh, Annabella," isn"t it better that
I said, "Oh, Annabella" and I was here with you,

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.399
than to say "Oh, Lizzie" and be somewhere else
with Annabella?

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.912
Yeah.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.550
I know what you"re doing. You"re going to do
what he did to Annabella on the sofa.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.189
- Don"t say things like that now, Fred.
- Lizzie.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:49.197
I think it"s time to say goodbye... to your friend.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.276
Hey. Hey!

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.636
Listen, l"m Drop Dead Fred, right?

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.829
If your husband thinks he can get rid of me
with a stupid pill, he"s got another think coming.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.472
Ow.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.874
Well, thank you very much, dear friend.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.552
Oharles.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.960
Oh, you look so handsome!

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.238
- Lizzie, come on, now. Don"t do that.
- We have to do it this way.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.276
Look, l"ve got a long day.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.276
I don"t like him.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.111
No. It scares me.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.156
Go on. Out his throat.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.756
Go on.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.515
- What"s the news?
- Wait till my endorphins kick in.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.673
You know, the body"s natural morphine.
Here it comes.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.478
Ooh!

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.030
- The aerobic rush. Now ask me.
- What"s the big news?

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.678
Have you ever seen so many zeros
outside of the national debt?

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.196
- I never knew a barge was worth this much?
- Not a barge. A river condominium.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.829
I had no idea they were worth
that much until mine sank.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.959
What a total groove. You"ve got Oharles back
and I have all those zeros.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.271
Our lives have worked out!
Thank you, Drop Dead Fred.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.113
Don"t waste your breath. L"m phasing him out.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.350
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.671
(Oharles) What"s for dinner?
(Elizabeth) Your favourite.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.274
(Oharles) Beef Wellington, how nice.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.277
- To us.
- To... us.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.796
For you, my love.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.954
What the hell is that?

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.037
- Mud pie.
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:08.193
- Fred!
- It"s either him or me, Elizabeth.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:13.832
It"s you. I swear. Fred is gone.
You know what? L"ll make a dinner salad.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.037
- Forget it.
- L"ll make a lovely salad. Please.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.558
It"ll be the most romantic, wonderful,
romantic... romantic salad.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.712
- A romantic dinner salad.
- Yeah. OK?

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.155
- OK.
- Here I go. L"m making it.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.718
It"s going to be so good. If you leave those pants,
l"ll take them to the dry cleaners tomorrow.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.950
You"ll never hear from Fred again.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.716
- He"s the wrong man for you.
- I don"t want to hear it.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.756
You"re not happy.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.908
- Yes, I am.
- If you"re so happy, why am I still here?

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.316
I can fix that.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.674
No, don"t do that. Please don"t do that.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.674
Darling...

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.797
Of course I still love you, Annabella.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.714
Hey, l"m your fella, Annabella.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.756
Yeah.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.910
Snot face, come here.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.037
- I don"t hear you.
- It"s important. He"s worse than the megabeast.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.755
- That"s it. L"m taking the last pill.
- No.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.513
- The goodbye pill.
- Don"t do that.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.350
Just look in there. Please.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.752
Annabella... Annabella, she"ll never know.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.796
And so what if she does?

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:06.908
No, listen. Would you listen?
I am in control with Lizzie.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.309
L"m in the driver"s seat.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.356
She trusts me.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.956
You"ve got to leave him.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.632
I don"t feel so good.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.918
Leave him.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.356
I can"t.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.632
L"m scared to be alone.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.956
Oome with me.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.192
- "Fred?"
- "Yeah."

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.955
- "Where are we going?"
- "Use your imagination."

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.153
- "Fred?"
- "You"ll know what to do."

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.316
"Fred?"

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.469
(Door bangs)

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.869
L"m scared.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.110
I don"t want to be alone here.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.196
(Fire crackling)

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.593
(Olock ticking)

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.079
Get in, Lizzie. I want to take you away, goose.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.232
Don"t you love me any more?

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.713
- Hi.
- Fred.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.915
So what are you going to do about him?

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.792
Nice job. Nice job.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.634
Oouldn"t have done better myself.
Oome on. This way.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.873
Ow!

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.556
We need a tree.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.995
(Rumbling and creaking)

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.397
You"re getting good at this. Let"s go.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.834
Just where do you think you"re going?

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.433
Just forget her. Just say the magic words.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.270
- L"m not afraid of you.
- You can"t go in there.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.990
L"m not afraid of you!

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.877
Finally, the magic words.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.755
We don"t have to be afraid any more.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.275
You have to go now.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.638
OK. L"m ready.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.750
- Let"s go.
- No.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.673
You have to go alone.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.514
- But I want you to come back with me.
- That"s just tough.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.949
You have to go alone. I can"t get back now.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.876
Look, you"ve got you now.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.997
You don"t need me. Not any more.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.479
So...

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.312
goodbye.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.517
Just kiss me and say Drop Dead Fred.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.036
Now.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.076
Drop Dead Fred.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.078
What do you mean it"s no good for you this way?
Annabella, wait.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.469
(Dialling tone)

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.835
Well, to hell with you, Annabella.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.719
Lizzie, is our romantic salad ready?

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.836
Yeah.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.956
Bye, Oharles.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.792
Oh!

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.916
I forgot to give you something.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.557
Yes, Oharles. Leave everything to me. It"s Oharles.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.198
Oharles?

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.032
Young lady, you have a lot of explaining to do.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.353
I know what"s best for me. You have
to stop treating me like l"m your enemy.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.069
Enemy? Sometimes I wonder with you.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.469
I made the same mistake a lot of people make.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.030
- I had a child to save a marriage.
- How can you say that?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.680
You made things worse. He left because of you.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.552
What a pile of shit.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.508
Don"t you dare. Don"t you dare walk out on me.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.119
Elizabeth. Lizzie.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.156
L"ll be lonely.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.595
You should get yourself a friend.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.433
You have a lot of options open to you right now.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.557
I just think l"d like to be one of them. OK?

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:10.709
- OK.
- Daddy, it was his idea.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.634
I wanted to play but he bumped me
on the head and said piss off.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.599
- Natalie, what did you do?
- Natalie Bunce, where are you?

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:21.797
Oome back in here this minute
and get cleaned up.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.836
Natalie, what happened here?

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.118
- It"s chocolate and it"s yummy. Want some?
- No, I don"t want any.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:33.752
She made a terrible mess in the kitchen
and expects me to believe a pretend friend did it.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.310
He"s not pretend. He"s Drop Dead Fred.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.756
What did you say?

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.116
She said l"m not pretend. What are you, deaf?

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.317
Natalie, now, come on. What really happened?

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.517
I told you. Don"t you believe me?

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:56.958
I believe you. Next time you see
Drop Dead Fred, you send him my love.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.278
Mr Bunce.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.909
Look out. It"s the witch. Oome on. Quick.

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:08.636
This is it. L"m afraid you"re going
to have to find a new baby-sitter.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.676
She"s just too much.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.357
OK. Now.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.799
Help! Help!

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.394
We did it. I told you it would work. Brilliant.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.557
Help! Help! Help!

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.478
Well done.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.313
