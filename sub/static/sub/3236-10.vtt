04:22.520 --> 04:26.355
Mariano, it's me.
I need you to get Skyler on the line.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.119
No, no, I need you to get her
on the phone right now.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.475
Tell her it's urgent.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.520
No... What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

04:37.680 --> 04:41.674
I am giving you permission, Mariano.
You make her get off the phone.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.396
Mariano, who is Skyler
on the phone with?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.440
Yeah.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.914
Okay.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.598
Where is she? Where's Skyler?
She just kind of left.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.036
She didn't say
where she was going.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.835
Skyler, my... My head is spinning.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.395
And yours, I...

06:34.880 --> 06:36.997
I can't even imagine.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.430
So much makes sense to me now.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.595
You jumping in the pool,
you sending us your kids, I get it.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.429
I just wished I'd seen it sooner.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.317
He's a monster.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.240
He's a...

07:02.520 --> 07:06.196
Look, I don't know what he did to you
to force you to keep his secrets.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.792
If he threatened you,
or whatever mind games he played...

07:10.960 --> 07:13.839
I don't know if there was abuse.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.279
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.477
Don't hold anything back, okay?

07:20.640 --> 07:24.429
I mean, I don't even understand
if you know the full extent of this,

07:24.600 --> 07:25.920
what he's done.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.472
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.909
But, look, that's all behind you,
starting now.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.030
You're done being his victim.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.191
Because here's
what we're gonna do.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.120
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.474
You and the kids will
move back to our house,

07:50.640 --> 07:53.792
where you'll be safe,
where he can't get to you.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.553
Hank, does Marie...?

08:00.560 --> 08:03.632
No. We'll get to that soon enough.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.757
It's just you and me right now, okay?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.156
Okay.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.039
Before we, um...

08:12.640 --> 08:16.520
Before we get you
back to the house, I...

08:17.200 --> 08:21.035
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.192
Um, take as long as you like.

08:23.360 --> 08:28.435
Just start from the beginning when you
first became aware of Walt's activities

08:28.600 --> 08:33.311
and just try to be
as detailed as you can.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.717
What, right... Right here?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.714
Right now?
Sure. Why not?

08:41.880 --> 08:44.030
While it's still fresh, you know?

08:44.200 --> 08:49.594
And just remember to state your name
and the date before you start.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.433
Hank, do...?

08:53.560 --> 08:56.155
Do we have to do this right now?

08:58.840 --> 09:01.833
No, we don't have to do this
right now, no.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.234
Here's the thing, I need something
solid that I can bring to my people.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.511
A statement, on the record.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.149
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity,

09:12.360 --> 09:14.875
whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.635
Okay? I mean, you see,
building a case this big,

09:17.800 --> 09:20.554
gathering evidence,
enough to get a conviction,

09:20.720 --> 09:22.871
we're talking a long-haul proposition.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.960
I don't want that bastard running out
the clock. But with your testimony...

09:27.120 --> 09:29.396
What do you mean,
running out the clock?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.152
His cancer. His cancer is back.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.834
So he says.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.554
He didn't tell you?

09:40.640 --> 09:44.759
Who's to say it's even true?
Lying piece of shit.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.275
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.550
Fine. Okay?

09:49.720 --> 09:55.557
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye
and he says if what I know is true... "If."

09:56.040 --> 09:58.760
...he'll be dead before I can prove it.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.957
The balls on that son of a...

10:01.360 --> 10:04.512
I got all these little pieces.
They're all part of the story.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.435
They don't mean much on their own,
but when you tell me what you know,

10:08.600 --> 10:13.391
we start filling in the gaps, I'll have
him in lockup before the sun goes down.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.359
Hank, I...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.157
I think maybe...

10:19.320 --> 10:20.993
Maybe I need a lawyer.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.915
What?

10:23.440 --> 10:24.999
No, no, no, you don't.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.720
Yeah, I think maybe I do.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.071
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.596
But to do that, I need your help.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.800
We start bringing in lawyers
and they start putting up roadblocks

10:36.960 --> 10:38.713
where they don't need to be

10:38.880 --> 10:42.032
and my ability to control
this situation diminishes.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.438
Just for my own protection,
and just...

10:45.600 --> 10:51.551
You know, it seems to make sense
that I should have someone to talk to.

10:51.960 --> 10:56.591
Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here,
and I'm telling you, for your own good,

10:56.800 --> 10:59.520
you need to get out
ahead of this thing.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.151
I mean, you start, you know,
getting defensive...

11:04.320 --> 11:07.677
I'm not saying it's right,
but I'll tell you it's a fact,

11:07.840 --> 11:10.639
the DA will look at you differently.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.998
But you don't know that.
Skyler, yes, I do.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.676
I've been around long enough to know.
It's in your best interest

11:17.840 --> 11:21.197
to get out there and show the world
you have nothing to hide.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.400
Look,

11:26.680 --> 11:30.071
no one in the world
is more important to me

11:30.760 --> 11:32.353
than your sister.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.200
So believe me when I tell you

11:36.360 --> 11:42.038
that your best interests
and mine are the same.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.912
But, Hank, you telling me
not to talk to a lawyer

11:46.080 --> 11:48.436
doesn't sound like that at all.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.670
It sounds like what you want...

11:54.000 --> 11:57.118
What you want is to get Walt

11:57.320 --> 11:58.720
at all costs.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.675
Okay.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.559
Okay, let's just...

12:05.320 --> 12:07.960
slow down. Slow down.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.915
You can...

12:10.640 --> 12:13.360
You can talk to a lawyer later.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.196
But right now, what we need to do,

12:18.360 --> 12:20.033
we need to go get the kids.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.193
We need to bring them to my house
so that they're safe,

12:23.360 --> 12:28.560
and then we need to help each other
put that animal away, okay?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.636
Come on.
Hank.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.679
Let's go to the house
and we'll deal with it there.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.877
Am I under arrest?

12:38.240 --> 12:42.519
What?
Am I under arrest?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.836
Skyler, I...
You're not thinking straight about this.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.272
You have to listen to me. I...
Skyler. Skyler. Skyler.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.635
Am I under arrest?
No.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.314
Am I under arrest?
No. Sky...

12:57.480 --> 12:59.472
Hank, are you arresting me?
Sky...

12:59.640 --> 13:01.791
Am I under arrest?!

13:44.280 --> 13:46.875
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.037
I gotta do it, man.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.596
Dude.
Mm.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.070
What are you doing? Huell.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.272
Hey, quit screwing around.
Mm.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.195
We are here to do a job,
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.510
You hearing me?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.239
I hear you.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.470
Dude.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.640
Aw, screw it.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.239
Mexico.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.676
All's I'm saying.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.317
Guy hit 10 guys in jail
within a two-minute window.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.398
All's I'm saying.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.838
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, you've got to hide those bags.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.038
The monkey is in
the banana patch, capiche?

14:50.240 --> 14:51.913
So call me.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.437
That's the third message.
Where the hell is that kid?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.112
That's her.
Don't.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.272
I have to talk to her.
You don't.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.956
Answer that phone and Schrader's
on the line with a wiretap

15:06.120 --> 15:09.397
recording everything.
You're not doing anybody any favors.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.917
Why do you still have a battery
in that thing? Take it out.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.754
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.196
I'm not being paranoid. Do it.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.114
I can't believe she went to him.
She just panicked.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.114
She went right to him
without even talking to me.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.631
I'm not saying it's not bad.
It's bad, but it could be worse.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.999
Really? How much worse could it be,
exactly, in your estimation?

15:34.200 --> 15:37.238
What does she actually know?
What has she seen? Hm?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.995
Nothing. It's hearsay.
It's all he said, she said.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.437
The only real evidence that
she can lead them to is your money.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.514
Once we take care of that,
well, yeah, then they got nothing.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.833
Nothing? Hank knows.
That's not nothing.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.470
Yeah. I can't exactly see him
turning the other cheek.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.629
Of course there's always, um...

16:04.240 --> 16:05.720
Always what?

16:07.040 --> 16:13.480
Have you given any thought to,
um, sending him on a trip to Belize?

16:15.560 --> 16:18.473
Belize?
Yeah, Belize.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.472
You know, where, uh...

16:20.640 --> 16:25.999
Where Mike went to,
off on a trip to, uh, Belize.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.951
Saul, you better not be saying
what I think you're saying.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.033
It's just conjecture on my part.
Hank is family.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.795
Okay, it's an option that...
You understand that?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.998
It's an option that has worked well
for you in the past.

16:39.160 --> 16:43.871
Jesus. What is wrong with you?
My mistake. Family, off limits, of course.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.431
I'm just throwing thoughts out there.
This is a safe room, right?

16:47.600 --> 16:51.355
Jesus. Send him to Belize.
I'll send you to Belize.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.520
Finally.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.199
It's about time.
Have you two been followed?

17:04.359 --> 17:05.714
Are you sure?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.719
If they had, we'd all be
in handcuffs right now.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.275
I took the tops off.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.273
Figured you'd wanna check
to make sure it's all there.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.874
You figured right.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.070
Close enough.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.514
If you need any help on the other end...
These things are a bitch to move.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.240
I'll manage.
And we don't mind overtime.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.754
Ain't no thing.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.273
Pay Huell and Kuby
and take your cut.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.399
The rest is mine.
Insurance in case I need you.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.598
In case you need me?
I'm thinking the probability is high.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.240
Just find Jesse.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.995
Keys.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.314
Saul Goodman, please. Skyler White.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.796
No, no, please don't tell me
he isn't there.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.600
I know he's been avoiding my calls.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.676
All right, well,
has my husband been there?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.836
What do you mean you don't know?
Either he has or he hasn't. I don't...

19:47.360 --> 19:49.192
Sweetie.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.150
Sky?

19:59.920 --> 20:01.513
Sky, I know you're home.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.151
Let me in. Let me talk to you.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.520
I'm just gonna wait here
until you open the door.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.876
So let me in now
or three hours from now,

20:12.040 --> 20:14.600
but I'm not leaving until I see you.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.599
Skyler, please.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.360
Just you.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.639
Not Hank.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.636
Tell me Hank is crazy.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.193
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.515
You gotta give me something, Skyler.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.240
Anything to help me understand.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.638
It can't be true.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.673
Oh, my God.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.675
How long have you known?

21:27.400 --> 21:31.474
Hank said that when you walked
into the pool, that's when you knew.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.319
When you had your...

21:37.440 --> 21:41.480
But not then. Before that.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.431
Since Gus Fring?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.353
The money.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.195
All that money that Walt made

21:56.400 --> 21:58.915
when you bought your car wash.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.072
And your whole gambling story.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.880
That was a lie.
I...

22:11.320 --> 22:13.391
Did you know then?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.433
You had to.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.074
Skyler...

22:33.320 --> 22:37.360
did you know
since before Hank was shot?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.279
Skyler?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.432
Marie.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.351
I am so sorry.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.077
You're sorry.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.356
You're...

22:58.560 --> 23:00.279
I'm sick of...

23:02.840 --> 23:04.479
You won't talk.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.757
You won't talk to Hank

23:06.920 --> 23:09.754
because you think that Walt
is going to get away with this.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.120
Oh, God.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.677
Come on, baby. Come on.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.594
Let's go.
Marie. Marie. Hey.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.070
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

23:38.240 --> 23:39.879
She's coming with us.
No, she is not.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.474
Give her back to me. Marie.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.478
Hank. Hank, help! Hank!

23:47.320 --> 23:49.789
You are not leaving this house
with my daughter.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.553
Give her back to me.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.030
Marie, give her back to me.
Stop it.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.435
You're scaring her.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.796
Give her back.
I'm trying to protect her.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.158
I'm her mother.
She's not gonna live in this madhouse!

24:01.320 --> 24:04.233
You don't know what you're
talking about. Give her back.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.437
Marie.
Listen, I will call the police.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.071
You call them. You call them, Skyler.
I will. Give me my baby.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.709
Marie, put her down.
You can't take her away.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.837
Marie.
Give me my baby.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.719
We are not leaving without her.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.190
Give me my baby now!
Marie!

24:20.560 --> 24:21.880
Do it now.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.672
Give her back.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.236
That's right. It's okay. It's okay.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.996
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.833
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.959
Okay, Mama has you now.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.232
Mama has you now.
Mama has you. Shh.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.111
It's okay. It's okay.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.279
Shh.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.199
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.996
It's okay.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.319
You have to get him.

27:05.200 --> 27:13.119
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.236
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.272
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

27:28.920 --> 27:34.234
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.638
Walt.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.592
Where have you been?

28:23.280 --> 28:24.794
Oh, my God.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.958
What happened?

28:40.160 --> 28:44.200
You moved the money, didn't you?
You buried it somewhere.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.156
Did you get my messages?

28:50.080 --> 28:52.754
I told Hank nothing.

28:55.760 --> 28:59.595
Walt, I swear I didn't.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.558
Say something.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.633
Please.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.836
Oh, my God.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.040
Walt. Walt.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.520
Hey.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.040
How...? How long was I out?

29:48.720 --> 29:50.837
Four or five hours.
Oh.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.596
How are you feeling?

30:02.360 --> 30:03.999
It's true.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.237
The cancer is back.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.473
Is this it?

30:33.840 --> 30:36.150
Does that make you happy?

30:38.800 --> 30:41.998
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.317
Just tell me.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.790
I know you talked with Hank.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.392
I know you made a deal.

31:03.240 --> 31:06.517
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

31:07.840 --> 31:12.710
I'll give myself up
if you promise me one thing.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.591
You keep the money.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.632
Never speak of it.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.038
Never give it up.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.320
You pass it on to our children.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.957
Give them everything.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.837
Would you do that?

31:38.280 --> 31:39.999
Please.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.952
Please don't let me
have done all this for nothing.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.036
How did Hank find out?

32:01.880 --> 32:03.633
Did somebody talk?

32:03.800 --> 32:06.315
No, no one talked.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.439
It was me.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.359
I screwed up.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.994
The way Hank talks,

32:25.600 --> 32:28.035
he's got his suspicions.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.237
Not much else.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.597
You can't give yourself up
without giving up the money.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.435
It's the way this works, Walt.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.555
So maybe our best move here...

32:52.560 --> 32:54.631
is to stay quiet.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.191
Okay, you can take it off now.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.878
All right, what's so important
you had to come way out here?

34:05.040 --> 34:06.679
The amount of money
I'm bringing in,

34:06.840 --> 34:11.072
I deserve to see why
it's all going wrong.

34:12.239 --> 34:13.993
You an expert on meth labs now?

34:14.159 --> 34:16.675
You gonna tell us
how to fix our operation?

34:17.400 --> 34:20.949
And what if I can help?
What will it hurt to show me?

34:21.199 --> 34:23.795
I don't like my time being wasted.

34:23.960 --> 34:28.795
Well, I'm here, and 10 minutes
is a small sacrifice

34:29.000 --> 34:31.674
when we're talking about
a $50 million shortfall.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.560
So?

35:07.280 --> 35:09.272
Safe to come down?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.592
Yeah. You're good.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.632
Ladies first.

35:46.760 --> 35:51.277
Okay, now you've seen it.
Yeah, now I've seen it.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.196
What?

35:54.440 --> 35:57.911
Well, how about
we start with it's filthy.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.073
What are you, my mother?
What filthy? It's just dimly lit.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.950
Do you seriously think this is up to
the standards of your predecessor?

36:05.120 --> 36:07.191
Because it's not. Not even close.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.194
Well, the product we're making,
it's selling just fine.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.670
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.231
To whom? A bunch
of scabby Arizona tweakers?

36:16.440 --> 36:20.992
They matter to my buyer in the Czech
Republic, therefore, they matter to me.

36:21.160 --> 36:25.120
Look, I cannot move what this person
is making if it's substandard.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.432
And it is. It just is. No offense.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.991
If you can do better, do better.
I don't know what to tell you.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.117
You tried to get the man back, right?

36:34.280 --> 36:37.034
He said no, so...
I mean, what do you want me to do?

36:37.200 --> 36:39.317
Todd. Use Todd again.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.269
Look, he learned from him, all right?

36:43.440 --> 36:46.399
At least Todd's first two cooks
were at 74 percent.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.557
On his third cook, he started a fire.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.713
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.
It didn't work out.

36:51.880 --> 36:55.191
I wanna cook in my territory.
I wanna use guys that I trust,

36:55.400 --> 36:57.232
not Todd, who I don't.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.956
And that's the end of the conversation
as far as I'm concerned.

37:03.640 --> 37:08.237
I really wish you'd have
given him a chance.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.551
Hey. We have a problem.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.920
You stay here.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.590
Get down!

38:10.120 --> 38:13.670
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

38:19.720 --> 38:21.074
Hello?

38:33.800 --> 38:36.076
Safe to come up whenever you want.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.200
I...

38:50.440 --> 38:52.193
I don't want to see.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.434
Okay.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.594
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...

38:59.200 --> 39:01.669
Maybe just close your eyes.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.674
Okay.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.474
This way.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.239
To the right.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.278
Ha-ha. Are you kidding me with this?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.311
Heh.
Uncle Jack.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.715
Fire in the hole.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.675
It's okay. Sorry about that.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.120
It's cool, lady.

40:06.720 --> 40:10.396
Okay, boys, let's take it all.
Let's get everything.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.595
Hey.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.594
You...

40:42.360 --> 40:44.158
going into work today?

40:46.520 --> 40:49.558
You're kidding, right?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.239
What about you?

40:59.480 --> 41:01.790
Are you going to the office?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.077
You have to tell them, Hank.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.560
Today.

41:09.720 --> 41:13.396
Marie, I just... I just don't have it yet.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.597
The piece I need to prove it all,
it's just not here.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.558
Then let them help you.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.473
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.520
You've got enough to get them
to believe your story at least.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.512
Put the whole DEA on it.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.240
That's how this is
supposed to work, right?

41:30.400 --> 41:31.629
No.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.515
No?

41:34.240 --> 41:37.153
What no? What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

41:37.320 --> 41:40.040
Look, baby...
You've gotta go in with this, Hank.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.079
Look, the day I go in with this...

41:45.040 --> 41:47.509
that's the last day of my career,
all right?

41:47.960 --> 41:52.557
I'm going to have to walk in there,
look those people in the eye

41:53.360 --> 41:56.637
and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year

41:56.800 --> 41:59.599
is my own brother-in-law.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.152
It's over for me.

42:09.720 --> 42:13.509
Ten seconds after I tell this story,
I'm a civilian.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.279
And then how can we help Skyler
if she comes to her senses?

42:19.800 --> 42:21.712
When I go in there...

42:23.200 --> 42:27.513
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.

42:31.480 --> 42:34.757
I can be the man who caught him,
at least.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.354
What if you wait

42:37.200 --> 42:39.078
and they catch Walt without you?

42:39.280 --> 42:42.830
If they find out that you knew
and you said nothing?

42:43.640 --> 42:46.314
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?

42:54.640 --> 42:55.915
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.720
Morning.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.959
Hey.
Hey, boss.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.590
How you doing, Hank?
Hey.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.358
Hey. Look who's back.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.591
I had to see it with my own eyes.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.474
How you doing?
Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?

43:28.640 --> 43:31.030
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.998
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.675
All right, don't make me sorry
I stopped by here.

43:35.880 --> 43:38.714
Anyway, you got
a budget meeting in an hour,

43:38.880 --> 43:42.556
then a meet-and-greet with
the new prescription task force guys.

43:42.760 --> 43:47.915
All right. Hey, you know, listen.

43:48.080 --> 43:51.960
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed

43:52.560 --> 43:57.316
and instead see if you could set up
a conference call with Ramey.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.834
What for?

43:59.000 --> 44:03.677
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing,
you know, for me.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.998
All right. You got it.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.637
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

44:10.520 --> 44:12.000
No, what money thing?

44:12.160 --> 44:16.393
Oh, you're gonna love this.
It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.560
Pinkman?

44:19.040 --> 44:22.920
I'll give you this.
Jesse, you're never boring.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.673
Not boring at all.

44:24.840 --> 44:28.834
So come on, buddy, share with us.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.994
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?

44:34.120 --> 44:37.192
I promise you we can hold out
just as long as you can.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.632
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the size of a hot water bottle.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.872
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't
be able to stop talking about it.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.555
I know. But I don't think I'd be
tossing it out my car window.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.949
Heh-heh. Yeah.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.232
My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.199
But apparently Jesse is raking it in.
Yes, indeed.

44:54.360 --> 44:58.195
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.919
Sure. He found it.

45:00.080 --> 45:03.596
Or won it in a card game, maybe.
That's it. Won it in a card game.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.439
Lucky night at the casino.

45:05.640 --> 45:08.712
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?

45:13.400 --> 45:16.313
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you
gather your thoughts

45:16.520 --> 45:19.194
so we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

45:19.400 --> 45:23.679
Can we get you anything?
Coffee? A soda?

45:23.840 --> 45:27.993
Right.
Yeah. Thought not.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.960
I have a history
with Jesse Pinkman,

45:41.120 --> 45:45.080
and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

45:45.240 --> 45:48.995
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

45:49.240 --> 45:53.917
You said he wasn't talking?
Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.912
Despises me, okay?

45:56.080 --> 45:59.232
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

45:59.440 --> 46:04.879
Then you guys go in, get what you need
from the little shit-stain, finish him off.

46:05.280 --> 46:10.150
Gives me anything useful while he's
with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.595
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

46:13.760 --> 46:18.198
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on our
suspect for us, just for a few minutes.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.670
Absolutely.
I can do that.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.996
