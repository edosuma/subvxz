00:15.920 --> 00:17.280
ALICE: Okay, so where do I meet him?

00:17.480 --> 00:18.760
CORNELIUS:
Well, apparently,

00:18.880 --> 00:22.320
there's a bench
on the north side of the promenade

00:23.040 --> 00:28.600
on the corner of, erm,
Spitsenstraat and Houtdok-Noordkaai.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
They'll meet you there.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
ALICE: And you're sure
he's ready to pay?

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
Mmm-hmm.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.280
-Merci.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.520
Jacob, how did it go?

01:37.760 --> 01:39.360
JACOB:
It's all gone according to plan.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.440
My men will have your diamonds by now.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
Thank you.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.920
-LUTHER: All right, all right.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.480
Wotcha.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.480
Don't pretend you're not pleased
to see me.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.080
I'm not.
I'm a bit surprised you're alive.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.320
I didn't come looking for joy
unconfined, just a...

03:53.080 --> 03:54.120
place to hide.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.760
Maybe a cup of tea
and a chocolate digestive.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.200
-Please.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.080
Nope.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.640
Oh...

04:08.720 --> 04:13.560
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

04:15.640 --> 04:20.880
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

04:22.880 --> 04:27.920
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

04:29.680 --> 04:33.120
♪ She will love you like a fly

04:33.200 --> 04:36.160
♪ Will never love you again ♪

05:01.680 --> 05:02.880
Ow.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.520
Ugh.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
Ow!

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Ah!

05:29.480 --> 05:30.720
Ah. Ow.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
LUTHER: Alice,

05:35.400 --> 05:36.880
I don't want anything to do with it.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.240
I want you patched up

05:40.520 --> 05:42.240
and out of the door.
Do you understand me?

05:43.960 --> 05:44.960
Ow.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
Ow! Ow.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.160
A big boy did it and ran away.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.800
Mmm.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.000
ALICE: You robbed me, George.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.320
I can understand why you think that,
but,

06:28.520 --> 06:29.720
they stole from us both.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.120
All right, what do you want?
I'm a thief. I've robbed you.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.480
How was I to know you're basically
the Tasmanian Devil?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.040
Make the transfer.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.680
Pay what you owe, plus, erm,
20% for the inconvenience.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.160
I'm afraid I have to decline.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.120
I beg your pardon?

06:57.480 --> 06:59.080
I'm not buying what you're selling.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.120
I'm selling your son, George.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.520
Even so.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.960
You crack me up, George.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.200
You really do.
But I really am going to need that money

07:14.320 --> 07:17.480
or I'll take Alice's head to the zoo
and feed it to the monkeys.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.240
Oh, no, come now.
You're not gonna do that here.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.240
Ow.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.520
Kidnapped his son
and tried to do him over.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.560
Ow!

07:42.360 --> 07:43.880
George and I had a little chat.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.960
-Oh.
-I say "chat".

07:47.360 --> 07:48.600
He beat the crap out of me.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
Ow!

07:50.640 --> 07:51.840
-Oh.
-Ah.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.760
Ah. I see... Ow!

08:13.560 --> 08:15.680
MAN: Hold up. Hold up.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.040
HALLIDAY: Sorry, boss.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
I've been reading this

08:44.360 --> 08:46.280
and it's James Hauser's
psychiatric file.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.320
Something's off.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.680
All right, yeah, erm...
Come on in.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.080
Come on, yeah.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.200
LUTHER: Close the door behind you.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.520
So, Vivien Lake gives us her patient's
psychological history.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.200
It talks a lot about his shame

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
and anxiety.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.920
Now, the actual file talks a lot

09:09.040 --> 09:11.680
about his obsession with
suicidal ideation, I mean,

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
-a lot.
-Does she mention

09:12.840 --> 09:13.960
that he's a suicide risk?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.720
-Not once.
-Let's have a look.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.280
-So...

09:19.800 --> 09:22.720
...what if you're right?
What if she did cross the line?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.720
Vivien Lake and James Hauser
in a psychosexual...

09:37.600 --> 09:39.320
Speaking of which, erm,

09:40.280 --> 09:41.440
do you mind if I...

09:44.120 --> 09:46.560
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Upstairs, first on the right.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.280
Well, Hauser spirals out of control,
Vivien's now implicated.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.280
She faces ruination, maybe prison.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.080
But the one thing we knew about him,
or thought we knew,

10:04.360 --> 10:06.320
or whatever,
he didn't want to get caught.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.960
He was audacious,
but he was also careful.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.120
With the masks, with the cameras,
the escape routes...

10:16.760 --> 10:18.680
...decides to kill himself
rather than get arrested.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.840
Maybe he's ashamed? I mean, he could be.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.920
(HALLIDAY CONTINUES
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

10:29.120 --> 10:31.280
Who knows what drives someone
to kill themselves, right?

10:31.720 --> 10:34.960
Except in this case, someone knows.
Vivien Lake.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.440
Yeah?

10:49.840 --> 10:53.200
(HALLIDAY CONTINUES
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

10:59.880 --> 11:01.520
Er, oh, boss?

11:10.280 --> 11:11.800
I think DS Halliday is on to something.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.920
I think she probably is.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Yes.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.240
HALLIDAY: So, erm,

11:20.400 --> 11:22.600
what's the next step? How...
How do we play it?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.760
Well, it won't be easy.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.040
Her defences are up. She's calculating.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.840
She's intelligent and she's got nerve.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.160
Besides, we don't have any hard evidence
of wrongdoing.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.360
No, we don't.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.160
Is she married?

11:47.720 --> 11:48.720
Eighteen years.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
Happily?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.400
HALLIDAY: Apparently.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Why?

11:53.320 --> 11:56.160
Well, the happier the marriage,
the easier it is to weaponise.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.760
And the Cynic of the Year Award
goes to...

12:00.920 --> 12:02.440
No, I'm not a cynic.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.560
That's basically my problem.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.480
I think we, er, pay the husband a visit

12:09.560 --> 12:11.240
and then see how Vivien Lake reacts.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.440
Guv?

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
Yeah.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.720
And you're off.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.560
Oh, sod this.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.240
He thinks you're my weak spot.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.040
He thinks he can hurt me by hurting you.

No!

What's the rule?

15:11.760 --> 15:12.920

And did you?

15:19.880 --> 15:20.880
No.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.280
No.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.480
James was our one contingency.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.680
Took me months to lay the groundwork.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.480
And now it's thrown away.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Just used up.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Wasted.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
I'm sorry.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.680
I hope you know I can't go back
to my house until this is put right.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.280
What if it can't be put right?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.640
No, I want my life back
the way it was until you pitched up.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
It will be put right.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.560
Sorry!
-You're really not.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.560
What do you want me to say?

16:05.400 --> 16:06.960
I've rather missed all this.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.120
-So have you, probably.
-I really haven't.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.840
-Oh, pish.
-Look at my face.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.160
-Shh!
-Look at it!

16:12.240 --> 16:13.360
-Oh...
-Er...

16:13.520 --> 16:15.520
-Yeah, yeah. Hurry up.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.320
-Just...
-No, I got it.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.400
Shit, come on.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.520
-Ah, magic.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.840
Well, she sounds very keen.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.000
Anne of Green Gables, erm,
I don't know, Heidi.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.480
-Halliday.
-"Halliday." Oh! Oh, that's interesting.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
What is?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.120
Well, the impersonal use of her surname.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.360
Are you trying to un

16:52.440 --> 16:53.480
No.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.120
Because, honestly, why on Earth
would you do that?

16:56.200 --> 16:59.680
I just don't want you turning her face
into a...a handbag.

17:03.960 --> 17:04.960
How did you do it?

17:05.680 --> 17:07.360
Does it matter?

17:07.520 --> 17:08.800
Yes, it matters.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.280
I saw the murder report.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.560
Your body on the slab.
I saw all of that.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.440
Oh, John, don't be insulting.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.680
There's not much you can't buy
from a retiring officer

17:23.760 --> 17:26.360
with a crappy pension
and a chip on his shoulder.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
All I wanted to do

17:28.760 --> 17:31.640
was die, disappear,
and leave you in peace.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.880
But George Cornelius put paid to that,

17:35.960 --> 17:38.600
and that's why
I'm back to rap his knuckles.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.920
Is that all you're back for?

17:42.480 --> 17:43.680
What else is there?

17:44.520 --> 17:47.640
You couldn't just walk away?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.880
No, of course not.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.880
I had to be dead.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.720
That's how all your
best relationships end.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.360
VIVIEN: You look very handsome.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.640
I like your tie.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.960
You bought it for me.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.920
-Milan.
-I remember.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.160
You wore it the night you kicked
that Somali rent-boy half to death.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.960
No more risks.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
No.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
We have to be absolutely sure

18:30.600 --> 18:33.080
you're not developing any problems
with impulse control.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
I'm not.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.800
Because what's the rule?

18:42.840 --> 18:43.840
Play safe.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Play safe.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.240
Honestly.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.360
Girl on the bus, she went... So scared.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.000
Be that as it may,

18:56.240 --> 18:57.280
don't let it happen again.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.200
You need to be more careful.

HALLIDAY: DCI Luther sends
his apologies.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.800
You've got me today, I'm afraid.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.880
DCI Luther brings cake.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.240
-Usually.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.560
Are we talking about
the same DCI Luther?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.240
Big chap, likes cake.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
You're going to need a bucket.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.560
Er, for what?

19:33.680 --> 19:35.080
To be sick into.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.520
Do people really do that?

19:36.600 --> 19:37.680
Now and again.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
Too much cake.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.760
Perhaps we should crack on.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.040
There's a deep, obliquely-placed
incise neck injury

19:46.320 --> 19:48.160
at the front side of the neck.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.520
There are no other injuries.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.680
No hesitation cuts, no defence injuries.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.840
The pattern of the injury
is consistent with suicide.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.240
That he cut his own throat
and bled to death.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.200
Er, the lack of hesitation injuries,
how significant is that?

20:07.680 --> 20:09.680
Ordinarily, I'd say very.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.600
It's quite an endeavour to take
a scalpel to your own throat

20:13.680 --> 20:15.680
and do this without wavering.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.800
But?

20:17.640 --> 20:23.520
But Mr Hauser seems quite accustomed
to various levels of self-mutilation.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.040
I found 39 needles

20:26.520 --> 20:30.320
embedded in the lower abdomen,
the perineum and the testicles.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.080
I'm sorry, when you say "needles,"
what do you mean?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.000
Needles. Household sewing needles.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.120
And, er, who put them there?

20:38.240 --> 20:39.240
He did.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.400
The oldest of the needles
has been in situ for some time.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.640
Years, possibly.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.760
BENNY: More grunt, more finesse.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.800
These are absolutely the right wheels.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.600
I know my wheels, man.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.040
These are the right wheels
for the terrain.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
What are you doing, man

21:01.600 --> 21:03.040
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.400
Shh, shh.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.680
-Hello, boss.
Benny,

21:09.760 --> 21:10.840
I need you here.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.560
I'm sorry, boss,
I think I've caught that norovirus.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.120
I've basically been up all night
turning myself inside out.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.840
I don't care if you've shit out
your own liver on Oxford Street.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.640
I need you here, now.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.840
Then I'm on my way.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.560
Sorry, Minty, mate,
I'm going to have to tip.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.960
And that's it, is it?

21:32.680 --> 21:34.360
That's police protection
in this day and age?

21:36.640 --> 21:37.920
Try not to drink all the milk, eh?

22:03.520 --> 22:05.560
Jeremy Lake's office.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.920
I'm afraid Mr Lake's not yet
in the office.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.320
Can I take a message for you, Mrs Lake?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.440
Stay close to Mummy, darling.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.240
-Okay.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.720
Sorry about that.
Now, where were we last time?

22:44.920 --> 22:46.200
-Morning.
-JEREMY: Morning.

22:46.760 --> 22:47.840
Mmm-hmm.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.680
-Morning.
-JEREMY: Morning.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.760
-Morning, Miriam.
-Morning, Jeremy.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.560
-Mrs Lake left a message for you.
-Thank you.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.160
Oh, and Eleanor Cadman's
15 minutes early.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.240
Ah.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.960
Eleanor, I'm Jeremy Lake.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.040
Has someone talked you
through the procedure?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.640
-Er, no.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.800
-Yes, of course.
-Mmm.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.280
Yeah, sorry.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.040
You have a condition
known as mitral valve regurgitation.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.680
The valve inside your heart
isn't closing properly,

23:25.840 --> 23:27.000
so blood is leaking back.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.480
You're a diseased whore, so today
we're going to replace the faulty valve.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.080
Now, I'm going to make an incision
down the centre of your chest,

23:34.800 --> 23:37.760
and then I'm going to saw through
your sternum and separate the halves.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.960
Your heart is surrounded by a membrane,
called the pericardium.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.480
I'm going to cut through that
and kill you,

23:42.560 --> 23:45.720
then I'm going to make an incision into
your superior and inferior vena cava,

23:45.800 --> 23:48.360
and attach a very thin tube
called a cannula.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.760
I'm sorry,

23:50.920 --> 23:52.520
what did you say?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.560
Don't worry, I've done it 100 times.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.880
Right.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.320
ALICE: I had to keep it.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.400
Issues with the will.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
I bet there were.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.320
Typical Mum and Dad.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.280
Didn't actually write one.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.320
Did you know the observable universe
got bigger?

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
No, I missed that.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.720
Well, it's true.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.480
Last time I saw you, we assumed
there were about 200 billion galaxies.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.760
The revised estimate
puts it at two trillion, so,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.400
what we believed
to be absolutely everything

24:53.520 --> 24:55.600
was basically just a rounding error.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.440
Closer to zero

25:00.440 --> 25:01.720
than the true number.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.680
-Great.
-It's funny, really.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.240
We fantasise about these things.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.320
You become

25:12.960 --> 25:16.400
enraptured with how meaningful
it will all be.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.720
And with each repetition,
the fantasy becomes more refined,

25:20.800 --> 25:22.600
until one day it's perfect.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.880
What you'll do,

25:31.760 --> 25:35.640
what they'll say, what words and what
precise tone of voice, the look...

25:37.160 --> 25:39.040
The look in their eyes when they say it.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.400
The reality can never measure up.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.760
It was such an anticlimax.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.520
I almost wished I'd never done it.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.680
That's why meeting you is such fun.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.560
You made it meaningful.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.680
And you'll be glad I did it.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.600
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
-Oh, no, don't be.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.520
They were dead anyway.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.760
You made me feel better.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
Turned it into a sport.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.320
-It wasn't that.
-Of course it was.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
Not in the end.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.160
No.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.280
That's what spoiled it.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.320
Is that why you left?

26:39.560 --> 26:41.600
No, John, you left first.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.680
Right.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.280
Where is he?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.200
This way.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.040
Funny.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.040
I was never allowed boys in here.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.400
I only gave him a small sedative,

27:17.280 --> 27:18.800
but he's still away with the fairies.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.960
I think we have to take him back
to his dad.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.040
Er, no, in all honesty,
I'm not sure his dad wants him.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Look.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.360
Yeah, look, the poor boy's
an embarrassment.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.720
Cornelius can't just take him back
and pretend it never happened.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.320
It would weaken him.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.560
He has to punish us
and be seen to punish us.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.000
"We" are not "us".

27:40.280 --> 27:42.480
Well, ask him that.
He thinks we're up a tree.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.280
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.960
Yeah, well, I'll have to figure out
a way to make him

27:48.600 --> 27:50.000
come out of this looking stronger.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.960
Or option two,

27:54.160 --> 27:55.480
we kill him and run.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.720
We tried that. You got scared, remember?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.200
-No, John, that's not what happened.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.080
-You left.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.880
If that's what you think,
then you remember it wrong.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.520
I've got to go.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.160
More work, is it?

28:13.560 --> 28:14.560
Uncuff him.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.160
ALICE: If we want to disappear...

28:41.600 --> 28:43.360
I mean, really disappear...

28:44.960 --> 28:46.440
we need to liquidate these.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.320
REPORTER ON TV:
...man who is targeting shoppers.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.760
Why does it matter?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.440
-No.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.640
Do I?

29:52.440 --> 29:53.520
Yes.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.400
Well, then you're looking
in the wrong direction, John.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.920
Some of these people
would still be alive if I was there.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
How is he?

30:26.640 --> 30:29.400
Oh, he's a bit woozy, but he'll live.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.600
Silly sod.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.360
Well, I appreciate the courtesy.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.880
I told you I'd sort it.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.160
Did you know about this, honestly?

30:43.560 --> 30:45.080
No.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.440
Well, she was there, wasn't she?
Last night, at your gaff?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.120
Yeah, she showed up
five minutes before you did.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
Oh.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.400
So, where has she been hiding
all this time,

30:54.640 --> 30:56.000
the Wicked Bitch of the West?

30:57.400 --> 30:58.680
I don't know

30:58.760 --> 31:00.320
-and I don't care.
-Hmm, fair enough.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.640
More to the point,

31:03.080 --> 31:04.440
where is she now?

31:06.280 --> 31:08.960
Give her to me,
and you and me are all square.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.360
This is about a lot more

31:13.760 --> 31:14.880
then getting my boy back.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.480
Yeah, I know what it's about, George.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.480
That doesn't mean
we can't make it right.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.440
How do you propose to do that?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.880
Money.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.720
Where'd you get all this money?

31:29.080 --> 31:30.360
It's money tied into my house.

31:30.920 --> 31:31.920
You'd really do that?

31:32.560 --> 31:34.840
Give up everything you earned,
everything you've worked for?

31:37.040 --> 31:38.200
Yeah.

31:38.920 --> 31:39.920
For her?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.880
Let me get my boy back home.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.800
I'll give you a bell.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.800
Wakey, wakey.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.320
We're done. You can leave.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.800
John, tell me, what did you do?

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
I paid him off.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.320
I'm sorry, what with?
You don't have any money.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.640
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.040
There's always option two.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.440
LUTHER:  No, this is
not my fight, this is

32:26.120 --> 32:28.720
some hole you've dragged me in
and I've just dragged us out, okay?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.080
So now you can go home.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.200
-I'm not yours to...
-LUTHER: Alice, we're done.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.160
You can go.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.160
ALICE: You're looking
in the wrong direction.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.000
Well, why does it matter?

33:42.120 --> 33:43.840
About half a million people are murdered
every year.

33:43.920 --> 33:47.360
That's about 10,000 a week, 1,400 a day.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.880
One per minute.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.480
That's rounding the figures.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.240
-And excluding death by...

33:54.320 --> 33:56.200
So chances are it's happening right now

33:56.360 --> 33:58.440
in Distrito Central,
Port-au-Prince, Cape Town.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.680
So why does this one matter more?

34:01.680 --> 34:03.480
Does the pressure
of the moral circle decrease

34:03.600 --> 34:05.120
the further you get from the centre?

34:06.800 --> 34:09.000
Because that's
not really morality, is it?

34:10.360 --> 34:11.640
That's more a kind of...

34:12.760 --> 34:14.840
sanctimonious provincialism.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.480
Some of these people
would still be alive if I was there.

34:23.160 --> 34:26.240
Well, as untestable hypotheses go,
that's a doozy.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.440
I just know.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.840
And you don't think
this assumption of omnipotence

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
is a touch narcissistic?

34:37.920 --> 34:41.080
Because I have to say,
it didn't help dear old Justin Ripley,

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
did it?

35:09.720 --> 35:11.600
Sorry about that.
I had to drop something off.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.640
Oh, yeah

35:14.400 --> 35:17.600
-A box that said "Mind your own".

35:21.640 --> 35:23.200
Is there anything
that I need to know about?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.560
No.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.080
-No, you're good.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.880
-You're helping.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.160
This is helping.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.440
Jeremy Lake, I'm DCI John Luther,
this is DS Halliday.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.880
What would you like,
a round of applause?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.560
-Wouldn't hurt.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.920
I don't mean to be ill-mannered
but I'm due in surgery shortly, so...

35:45.480 --> 35:47.320
Can we have a seat for a moment?

35:48.200 --> 35:50.120
You have a medical condition
which requires it?

35:50.760 --> 35:52.240
Er, no.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.880
Well, then, yes, I mind.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.800
Er, we're just gathering
background information, really.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.280
Well, I'm not sure I can be much help.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.040
At least not in that regard.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.560
How much do you know
about your wife's patient,

36:05.680 --> 36:06.920
James Hauser?

36:08.280 --> 36:09.480
Before last night, nothing.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.000
So you were unaware of the, er,

36:12.200 --> 36:14.240
intense nature of their relationship?

36:15.640 --> 36:16.640
"Intense"?

36:16.760 --> 36:18.160
HALLIDAY: Yeah,
I think that's the right word.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.560
Is it?

36:21.360 --> 36:22.880
Vivien and I don't discuss patients.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.920
Is there a reason for that?

36:26.240 --> 36:28.200
Well, absolutely.
Acute lack of interest.

36:28.600 --> 36:29.600
They're like

36:30.040 --> 36:32.280
battery-hens shitting out
identical neuroses,

36:32.360 --> 36:34.760
each of them feeling different
in exactly the same way.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.640
HALLIDAY: Erm, how's Vivien feeling?

36:37.960 --> 36:41.360
It must have been quite the wrench
losing somebody she became so close to.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.400
Vivien is my wife,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.200
not my chattel.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.320
She can do whatever she chooses
with whomever she chooses.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.880
Er, personally,

36:50.960 --> 36:54.160
I very much doubt she'd risk her career
by sexually amusing herself

36:54.240 --> 36:56.320
with some masturbating oddball
who got his

36:56.600 --> 36:58.640
jollies by jamming pins
into his testicles

36:58.800 --> 37:00.920
and threading rusty wire
down his urethra.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I certainly haven't noticed

37:02.160 --> 37:04.880
any wounding to her buttocks or breasts,

37:05.040 --> 37:07.200
which, I understand,
were his areas of particular interest.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.800
Which is before he started
vivisecting them.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.040
Before then, yes.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.480
Now, if your hope in coming here

37:13.560 --> 37:16.800
was to deploy vapid innuendo
and state-sponsored slut-shaming,

37:16.880 --> 37:20.240
in an attempt to arouse my jealousy
and have me implicate my wife

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
in some imaginary wrong-doing,
then I'm afraid

37:22.680 --> 37:24.720
you've had rather a wasted journey.

37:25.800 --> 37:26.800
You're looking in the wrong place.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
For what?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.760
JEREMY: Whatever you might
be looking for.

37:31.840 --> 37:32.920
Unless I'm wrong,

37:34.040 --> 37:36.320
and you just wanted to fill up
the old wank bank.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.120
In which case I'm happy to oblige.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.560
Would you like to know
what she likes in bed?

37:40.920 --> 37:43.440
Aggressively...
-LUTHER: Jeremy,

37:43.920 --> 37:45.760
we're just trying to understand
what happened last night.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh, I see.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.160
Oh, that's easy. Er, last night,

37:50.440 --> 37:54.280
as a result of your catastrophically
poor judgment, a man died.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.800
And now you'd like to find a way
to hold my wife responsible.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.480
Honestly, best of luck with that.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.160
We'll see you in court

38:02.720 --> 38:05.080
-if we don't see you before.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.560
I'd have thought it fairly unambiguous.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.760
Well...

38:17.320 --> 38:19.520
-Thanks for that.
-Ah, been a pleasure.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.000
I don't know about you,
but I liked him.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.680
Well, for someone who doesn't know
anything about James Hauser, he...

38:28.760 --> 38:30.480
He seemed to know
a lot about James Hauser.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.520
-Yeah, he did.
-Breasts, buttocks,

38:32.600 --> 38:34.520
rusty old wires down
the old chap. Is that a thing?

38:34.600 --> 38:36.400
No, not in my house it's not.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.320
I mean, when we walked in,
he was holding up an MRI to the light.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.680
Well, er, he's a surgeon.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.320
No, he's a heart specialist.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.720
Why was he holding up an MRI
of someone's head?

38:51.120 --> 38:53.760
-Could be a number of reasons.
-Name one.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.280
Yeah, I guess that is weird.
Am I wrong, is it weird?

38:57.440 --> 38:58.480
It's weird.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.640
So, whose head was he looking at?

39:00.920 --> 39:02.040
Let's get back and find out.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.880
Eleanor?

39:44.840 --> 39:46.200
So how are we doing?

39:47.560 --> 39:48.720
ELEANOR: No, actually...

39:49.760 --> 39:51.760
-All right,

39:52.560 --> 39:54.160
Let's crack her open, shall we?

39:54.920 --> 39:56.040
See what's inside.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
We're in.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.680
Roseanna, purse string.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.440
-Right.
-NURSE: I'm sorry.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.880
JEREMY: That's all right.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.080
Give Heparin, please.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
Scissors.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.680
Diane, clip.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.280
DS Silver, I need you here now.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.400
No lies, no excuses, now.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.680
I've got to take this.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.560
Erm, why don't you just
go on and dig into that surgeon.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.720
He feels wrong.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.640
Yeah, like a kitten kebab.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.400
George?

42:46.640 --> 42:49.080
CORNELIUS: Something's been needling
at me since we spoke.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.520
LUTHER:
Oh, okay, what's that?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.360
Do I look like a tart to you, John?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.240
I mean, do I look like
I learned my trade

42:55.320 --> 42:58.000
noshing off Tory MPs in public lavs?

42:58.440 --> 42:59.760
I don't follow. What?

43:00.280 --> 43:02.240
Why would you think you could buy me?

43:02.960 --> 43:05.480
Honestly, it's baffling.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.320
George, look, whatever's happening here,

43:09.480 --> 43:11.920
all right, just... Just stop.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.920
All right, just pump your brakes,
take your tax, and let it go.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.280
Otherwise it's starting...
It's gonna get out of control.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.880
Whose control? Not mine.

43:21.280 --> 43:24.400
Now, you bring her to me, John,
then we can call it square.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.400
I can't bring her to you, she's gone.
I don't know where she's gone.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
All right?

43:28.560 --> 43:30.760
CORNELIUS: Which is what I thought
you'd most likely say. Hold on.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.400
George, I...

43:49.840 --> 43:51.400
George, I am warning you...

43:51.840 --> 43:52.880
CORNELIUS: You're warning me?

43:52.960 --> 43:55.640
Whatever you're thinking of doing, stop.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.480
You've got a pair of spuds on you,
I'll give you that. Ha!

44:04.120 --> 44:05.120
George.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.760
LUTHER: Stop.

44:12.760 --> 44:17.040
That woman is a debt you owe me, John.
I want her.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.800
I can't do what can't be done.
She's gone.

44:19.880 --> 44:21.480
I have no idea where she is.

44:24.920 --> 44:25.920
LUTHER: Oi!

44:26.360 --> 44:27.920
All right, all right, all right.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.040
"All right," what?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.480
-I'll do it.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.560
I'll bring her to you.

44:32.800 --> 44:33.920
You sure now?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.280
Just stop.

44:40.640 --> 44:41.960
No messing.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.360
No amusing chit-chat.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.520
No prevari-fucking-cation.
You get this done.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.960
It's done. I'll bring her to you.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.640
Oh, God!

45:03.360 --> 45:05.120
I know how much the idea's
always excited you

45:05.360 --> 45:07.640
to do it while everyone looks on,
but that level of risk...

45:07.720 --> 45:08.880
There was no risk.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.360
You were aroused, sexually.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.840
I could see it.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.640
-Now, I know how difficult it is

45:17.920 --> 45:20.400
watching the days slip by,
wanting each one to be special,

45:20.480 --> 45:21.680
but you have to understand

45:21.800 --> 45:23.480
that I still have a life to live.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.600
A career you're putting at risk.

45:27.760 --> 45:28.760
My liberty.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.040
Of course, sorry.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.200
Are you having any problems with recall?

45:35.120 --> 45:36.120
No.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.680
Your appetite?

45:39.400 --> 45:40.880
Well, it's a little diminished.

45:41.080 --> 45:44.600
No instances of pica or unusual cravings
or anything?

45:45.360 --> 45:48.680
No. Just the usual unusual cravings.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.120
I wish there was more
I could do for you.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.480
No one could do more.

46:01.640 --> 46:02.920
I love you.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.280
I love you, too.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.400
Are you out tonight?

46:20.160 --> 46:22.120
No. Straight home.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.800
I'm tired.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.840
I'll wait up for you.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.160
Alice?

47:08.680 --> 47:10.040
Alice?

49:02.920 --> 49:04.400
-Mmm.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.320
I'm Alan, Vickie's dad.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.440
-Oh, right! Hello.
-Hi.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.400
Oh, is it... Is it going to fit?

49:11.840 --> 49:12.840
Is that for the fridge?

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
Oh.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.240
I don't know.

49:17.480 --> 49:18.840
I haven't misjudged it, have I?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.400
-Anyways, she's double-parked outside,

49:21.480 --> 49:23.360
so best crack on. Erm...

49:23.600 --> 49:25.480
Mmm... Ninety

49:25.920 --> 49:28.240
-Yeah, it was.
-Er... Call it 100.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.280
Oh, thank you.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.840
-Look, yeah, you better come in and...
-Yeah.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.000
...see if that's going to work.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
Whoop.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.400
-Yeah.

49:47.480 --> 49:50.000
-Right, here we are.
-Ah.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.200
Let's just get this...

49:57.080 --> 49:58.360
Oh! Oh, God!

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
Babe?

51:02.280 --> 51:03.640
Is someone going to get that?

51:03.760 --> 51:05.440
(INDISTINCT FOOTBALL
COMMENTARY ON TV)

51:09.600 --> 51:10.800
Is anyone going to get that?

51:13.880 --> 51:15.040
Apparently not.

51:24.600 --> 51:25.600
Hello.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.640
-No.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.440
Er, George sent me. I am, er,

51:33.440 --> 51:34.600
welcome home present.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.200
Oh.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.280
Yeah, he's right this way.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.000
I think I can take it from here, hmm?

52:11.400 --> 52:12.760
Good luck.
