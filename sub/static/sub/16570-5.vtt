disabled tractor trailer off

00:11.870 --> 00:12.640
Can we
just --

00:12.650 --> 00:14.830
- no, no.Careful!
- It's okay.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.000
You know, we don't
have to do this today.

00:21.010 --> 00:27.080
No! No, no. These -- these things
could be used by other cats.

00:35.510 --> 00:37.310
Good morning, sergeant gabriel.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.750
Morning, chief. We just landed a
body at the crenshaw community center.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.840
Oh, no. Isn't that father jack's place?

00:42.850 --> 00:46.130
Yeah.You want me to come by and pick
you up or give you directions or --

00:46.140 --> 00:47.550
I know where it is.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.100
Uh, no, no. I'll, um
-- I'll be right there.

01:05.870 --> 01:07.630
Doesn't look like much.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.610
Maybe I'll wait, then.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.330
Chief's here. Appreciate it.

01:14.870 --> 01:18.140
Chief, agent howard, sorry
to cut into your weekend.

01:18.190 --> 01:21.200
Our, uh, victim is a
35-year-old male, black.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.390
Single gunshot to the back of the head.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.680
Was discovered around
7:00 A.M.This morning.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.590
Take a guess who found him.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.350
Father jack.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.670
Victim's name is, uh, reginald gray.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.570
He did maintenance work
for the community center,

01:34.590 --> 01:38.130
but he's paid by father jack's
church, which is where he was living.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.820
This is a major crime because...

01:39.830 --> 01:43.510
the community center's city-owned,
which immediately makes it our problem.

01:45.810 --> 01:46.920
Where's S.I.D.?

01:46.950 --> 01:49.360
- I told them not to come, chief.
- Why?

01:49.370 --> 01:52.020
There's nothing for them
to do. Victim was shot once.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.890
There's no casings, no
weapon, no witnesses.

01:54.930 --> 01:59.030
And father jack over there says
that the victim, reggie gray --

01:59.060 --> 02:03.870
who's still on parole, by the way -- is
some kind of like ex-con turned saint.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.580
Actually, what the father said is
that reggie had no known enemies

02:06.600 --> 02:09.320
and was well-liked in the
neighborhood, lieutenant.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.660
Yeah? Well, he doesn't
look very popular to me.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.970
Ricardo, this is father jack.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.930
- Nice to meet you, father jack.I'm ricardo ramos.
- Be right back.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.850
I got a few questions for you.

02:18.870 --> 02:22.100
Why is commander taylor forever
bringing that reporter around?

02:23.250 --> 02:25.220
Morning, chief.

02:25.230 --> 02:29.970
I know how it looks, but chief pope believes
if ramos is getting father jack's side,

02:29.990 --> 02:31.240
then he should get ours, too.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.630
Well, I don't know what our side is yet.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.990
Look, just -- just keep him away
from me as long as possible, please.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.340
All right.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.380
Haven't touched a thing, chief.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.290
Called the coroner and
gave me a one-hour E.T.A.,

02:44.320 --> 02:46.650
But it looks like reggie here's
been dead for quite a while.

02:46.670 --> 02:47.710
Why is he damp?

02:47.740 --> 02:49.800
Sprinklersooff every night at 10:00.

02:49.820 --> 02:52.350
So he must have been
murdered before that.

02:53.110 --> 02:54.790
Neighbors didn't hear gunfire.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.870
Around here, they never do.

03:00.690 --> 03:04.580
look, I-I-I can't go anywhere
until the body's taken away.

03:04.610 --> 03:07.790
Why don't I take kitty's things down
to the shelter, save you the trip down?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.600
No, no. We should do it together.

03:09.610 --> 03:11.680
You finish your simple investigation.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.460
I'll dispose of kitty's earthly effects.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.620
Okay. Thanks.

03:20.570 --> 03:24.090
Looks like he's got a wallet in his
back pocket, so it wasn't a robberY.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.420
Well, if it wasn't a robbery, why
else would someone want to kill him?

03:27.430 --> 03:29.560
- You want an alphabetical list?
- Fire away.

03:29.570 --> 03:33.460
"A," asshole. "B,"
because. "C," criminal.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.090
Excuse me, lieutenant?

03:35.120 --> 03:39.310
Do you always begin a murder investigation
by assassinating the victim's character?

03:39.350 --> 03:43.370
Actually, father, what lieutenant
flynn here meant to say is how sad it is

03:43.400 --> 03:46.890
that we're always meeting up again
under such tragic circumstances.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.780
Any reason why someone might
want to see this man dead?

03:49.810 --> 03:50.940
No, none at all.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.120
And I'm not just saying that
because reggie worked for me.

03:53.140 --> 03:55.520
Reggie was dedicating his life
to improving this community.

03:55.550 --> 03:57.170
Do you see that wall there?

03:57.190 --> 04:00.800
Reggie painted over the graffiti on it
constantly with supplies he bought himself.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.140
And he mentored several middle
schoolers, keeping them out of gangs!

04:05.150 --> 04:09.660
Yeah, that's right, lieutenant. That's
the kind of wretched human being he was.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.480
I understand that reggie
lived in your church.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.200
We're gonna have to
search through his room.

04:17.209 --> 04:18.480
Do you have a warrant?

04:18.500 --> 04:23.000
Well, no, but since he's a parolee, we can
search through his quarters anytime we like.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.050
Oh, no, no, no. Now, wait a minute. No.

04:25.060 --> 04:28.250
You're allowed to search his
quarters when reggie was alive.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.460
Now he's dead.

04:31.590 --> 04:34.190
- Is he reggie gray?
- Excuse me?

04:35.320 --> 04:39.620
Uh, commander taylor's point, father,
is tt until the coroner arrives,

04:39.660 --> 04:42.870
we can't remove the victim's wallet
and check his driver's license.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.840
Officially, we don't
know who this man is.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.610
I just identified him
for you! He worked for me!

04:48.620 --> 04:52.250
I'm afraid that doesn't work
as an official identification.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.130
Well, I'm -- I'm a little confused,
because his name tag says "reggie."

04:59.090 --> 05:02.380
Well, if there's one thing you've taught me,
ricardo, it's "don't believe everything you read."

05:02.410 --> 05:06.490
I-I tell you what -- while we're sorting through the
legal ins and outs of searching the victim's room,

05:06.500 --> 05:09.750
uh, commander taylor, if you could please
take a walk through the community center.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.940
It's city-owned, so we
don't need a search warrant.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.510
Just make sure that nothing's
broken into or missing.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.410
- Well, I need to be present for that.
- Fine.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.500
Feel welcome to join me, father.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.970
Ricardo, you too. You too.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.980
Still got that parole
officer's number on speed dial?

05:23.010 --> 05:24.440
- Sure do, chief.
- All right.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.890
Uh, lieutenant provenza, when
the parole officer arrives,

05:26.910 --> 05:30.650
would you and lieutenant flynn please
supervise the search of reggie's room?

05:30.660 --> 05:34.730
Sergeant gabriel, would you handle the
notification of the victim's family?

05:35.020 --> 05:40.580
Thank you. And, uh, detective sanchez, what
else do I need to know about this neighborhood?

05:42.000 --> 05:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:21.180 --> 06:23.040
Oh, thank you.

06:25.410 --> 06:27.520
Okay.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.220
So, what do we have here?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.800
It's gang central L.A., Chief.

06:31.810 --> 06:35.670
There's big overlap out there of
black, brown, and a little white.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.500
There's three regular gangs and then
one made up of all the gang rejects.

06:38.530 --> 06:41.420
That's what we call
"affirmative-action gangsters."

06:41.430 --> 06:43.990
Okay. And, uh, who does what?

06:44.690 --> 06:49.720
Well, over there... Dope.

06:51.420 --> 06:54.750
Over there... Weapons.

06:57.590 --> 07:00.960
And over there, chief... Car theft.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.650
Over there... More dope.

07:06.180 --> 07:10.910
Gang, gang, gang, gang.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.140
So I'm guessing reggie's death
had something to do with gangs,

07:14.170 --> 07:16.600
which is why no one in the
neighborhood will talk to us.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.910
And reggie's room at the church?

07:17.940 --> 07:22.370
Oh, outreach pamphlets, handyman
books, a blessed mother statue.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.070
Now, father jack was
right about one thing.

07:25.110 --> 07:29.050
Reggie painted over some graffiti three
times last month, including yesterday.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.460
So you can bet some gangsters
were pretty unhappy about that.

07:31.470 --> 07:34.910
There's a new sandblast technique
for removing a single layer of paint.

07:34.940 --> 07:36.000
Want me to order it up?

07:36.030 --> 07:37.740
I think we should, lieutenant.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.400
You know, the last
time we dealt with him,

07:39.430 --> 07:41.950
everyone said that father jack's
place was off-limits to gangs.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.100
Yeah, it still is, but
reggie's older. He did time.

07:45.110 --> 07:48.220
Maybe he made some enemies
we don't know about, chief.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.320
Sergeant gabriel, how
did the notification go?

07:50.360 --> 07:54.050
Well, reggie's mother
was devastated, but, um,

07:54.080 --> 07:58.040
she confirms what father jack said that reggie had
turned his life around, no problems with anyone.

07:58.070 --> 08:00.200
Then how did he end up dead?

08:01.290 --> 08:04.260
Did commander taylor notice anything
missing at the community center?

08:04.290 --> 08:06.300
Father jack said that there
was nothing out of place.

08:06.350 --> 08:09.920
And reggie's known associates from
his gang years are all dead and buried.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.760
So every cloud does
have a silver lining.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.390
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I-I applied for this
federal grant to upgrade our surveillance equipment,

08:17.570 --> 08:21.170
and I think I got it, but I-I
need help translating this letter.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.880
What language is it in?

08:22.890 --> 08:26.520
- Uh, government.
- Ah, yeah. Here, buzz. I read government.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.940
"in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the american recovery and reinvestment act" --

08:31.970 --> 08:37.240
da, da, da, here it is -- "for new surveillance and
communications equipment, "you have on account...

08:38.690 --> 08:42.179
- 70000"
- Really?

08:43.080 --> 08:44.070
Oh, my god.

08:44.110 --> 08:47.310
Now, why would the feds
give you that kind of money?

08:47.330 --> 08:50.780
Well, I promised to spend
it really fast, and I can.

08:51.050 --> 08:54.780
Speaking of fast, chief, the
morgue has a prelim ready.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.930
The bullet entered the soft
tissue right below the skull.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.290
But for a .32 caliber,
didn't penetrate very deeply.

09:04.330 --> 09:07.700
.32 caliber's a semiautomatic -- would
have kicked out a casing at the crime scene.

09:07.730 --> 09:08.710
We didn't find one.

09:08.730 --> 09:11.930
It may be a professional hit, and they
grabbed the casing and took it with them.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.810
What else do you know?

09:14.150 --> 09:16.820
Our victim is a former
gang member out on parole,

09:16.830 --> 09:18.970
and I've got a priest
who thinks he's a saint.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.600
Well, I don't know about saint, but he meets
the first big requirement for martyrdom.

09:23.610 --> 09:26.640
And he was having this tattoo removed.

09:26.660 --> 09:29.380
Maybe somebody felt insulted by that.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.320
Because when I see this type of
injury, we're talking execution.

09:33.330 --> 09:38.130
But no stippling, no sooting, which means
the shooter wasn't very close when he fired.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.870
Hey, doc, what if the, uh -- what if
the shooter stood like 20, 30 yards away,

09:41.890 --> 09:43.710
like, you know, from across the street?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.050
With a .32? That'd be a
hell of a shot, sergeant.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.410
What if the gun malfunctioned
or the bullet was a half load?

09:48.430 --> 09:51.350
Oh, well, um, a bad primer
could account for some of this.

09:51.370 --> 09:54.510
But honestly, the bullet
doesn't tell me much.

09:54.530 --> 09:56.990
Well, it's got to tell
us something, doctor.

09:57.370 --> 10:00.520
Look, w-we'll take it to ballistics.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.950
Hey, uh, chief, the people in that
neighborhood know something. They always do.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.470
Why don't we set up a meeting at the community
center and see if they can help us find the gun?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.210
We talk to them directly.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.200
- You want me to share information with civilians?
- Yes.

10:15.210 --> 10:18.140
Absolutely not! I'm
not doing that, ever.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.930
Just as well, really.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.050
Why's that?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.560
You don't have any information to share.

10:31.090 --> 10:35.970
So, you chose my day off to execute an
illegal search of father jack's church?

10:35.990 --> 10:37.550
There was nothing illegal about it.

10:37.590 --> 10:39.740
A parole officer visited
the victim's quarters.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.930
We only went along to make
sure it all went smoothly.

10:41.950 --> 10:44.920
Come on, brenda. Are you deliberately
trying to antagonize this guy?

10:44.930 --> 10:47.100
He is deliberately antagonizing me!

10:47.140 --> 10:52.120
I am looking for a killer, and, as usual, father
jack has been uncooperative every step of the way.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.560
What am I supposed to do about that?

10:53.590 --> 10:56.440
Well, for starters, you can
help me calm his holiness,

10:56.470 --> 10:59.580
even if it means you have to
behave like a nun to do it.

11:01.930 --> 11:06.460
It's bad enough the L.A.P.D.Won't respect our
outreach program to these children and gangs,

11:06.500 --> 11:10.730
but when one of our own becomes a target
and we're being treated like suspects,

11:10.750 --> 11:12.070
that's another thing altogether!

11:12.100 --> 11:15.430
We don't need more
suspicion. We need answers.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.010
We're searching for those answers.

11:17.040 --> 11:22.110
In my church and without a warrant and
without responding to any of our questions.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.100
We just got this case six hours ago.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.880
We can't pluck witnesses
and guns out of thin air.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.620
Miracles like that fall more under
your jurisdiction than mine, father.

11:30.630 --> 11:33.350
All right, look, we are all
after the same thing here.

11:33.370 --> 11:35.060
- And what makes you say that?
- Well...

11:35.070 --> 11:36.900
you want to find reggie
gray's killer, don't you?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.270
Of course I do!

11:38.300 --> 11:43.510
But how do I know the L.A.P.D.Isn't using his
murder to start another witch hunt in my parish?

11:43.540 --> 11:47.170
Let's bring your community together.
We'll talk to them directly.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.120
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.860
You'd be willing to speak with
my people in an open dialogue?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.800
Oh, I don't think a community
meeting is really a good idea.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.700
That is a fantastic idea.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.280
We can tell the people what we know,
and they could do the same for us.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.370
It'll show the community how
seriously we're taking this crime.

12:07.380 --> 12:11.200
Well, I have to warn you.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.130
My community feels abandoned.

12:14.160 --> 12:19.540
They're angry about reggie's death,
and trust me, they won't go easy on you.

12:19.550 --> 12:22.670
We can take it, father. Try us.

12:23.650 --> 12:26.520
Police see the same
things day in and day out!

12:26.560 --> 12:30.570
People getting shot, getting their
cars stolen, drugs sold on the corner!

12:30.610 --> 12:32.510
Now, why can't the police stop that?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.140
I understand your frustration.

12:35.160 --> 12:41.600
We came here specifically tonight to find ways
that we might help each other put an end to that.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.660
I saw you guys taking
paint off the wall outside.

12:46.690 --> 12:50.210
Do you think some gang members shot
reggie for covering up their graffiti?

12:53.690 --> 12:58.480
We checked into that, ma'am, and that was
done by a local tagger, not a gang member.

12:59.130 --> 13:05.290
But like all of you, we are trying very hard
to figure out why this happened to mr. Gray.

13:05.330 --> 13:08.720
A-a-and anything that you know
about the shooting last night,

13:08.730 --> 13:11.900
even the smallest detail, could help us.

13:18.810 --> 13:21.590
Uh, chief johnson, have you narrowed
down any possible motives yet?

13:21.610 --> 13:25.850
No, uh, but thank you for asking that,
because I'm especially interested in motives.

13:25.870 --> 13:31.170
Sometimes knowing why someone was shot can take
us a very, very long way into figuring out who --

13:31.200 --> 13:32.990
so, somebody got murdered, and
you want us to figure it out?

13:33.020 --> 13:35.670
How do we know we'll even be
protected if we tell you anything?

13:35.700 --> 13:38.120
You can't even protect this
community center anymore!

13:38.150 --> 13:40.780
I bet this has something to do
with reggie's stint in prison.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.430
No! No, it didn't!

13:45.390 --> 13:50.890
My son, reggie --
he paid his debt.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.920
He straightened out his life.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.570
He didn't deserve this!

13:56.080 --> 13:59.520
He was trying to make
something better for hisself,

13:59.820 --> 14:05.150
to make up for all the wrong
he did, with humility...

14:06.430 --> 14:10.660
and love... and hard work!

14:11.070 --> 14:15.160
And if we can't turn this place
around with spirit like that...

14:16.830 --> 14:20.580
then one of you is gonna be
sitting where I am tomorrow...

14:20.830 --> 14:24.640
or next week... or next year!

14:28.330 --> 14:31.860
Mourning the loss of your only child...

14:32.900 --> 14:38.070
how many children do we have
to bury before this ends, huh?

14:40.830 --> 14:45.020
When is this going to end?

14:46.020 --> 14:48.680
When?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.170
The police don't care.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.860
No. No, sir, we do. We care
very much. That's why we're here.

15:00.870 --> 15:02.960
Yeah, you say that, but last night,

15:02.970 --> 15:05.890
we had another run-in at the central
food and gas mart down the street.

15:05.920 --> 15:10.450
I mean, someone started shooting at people,
and the police just drove through and left.

15:11.150 --> 15:13.430
Uh, uh, sir, many times,

15:13.440 --> 15:17.990
if there's no one there when the officers
arrive, they move on to their next call.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.260
You tell us to call when
people put up graffiti.

15:20.300 --> 15:24.910
And then we go back and paint over it, someone
else comes back, does it all over again.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.040
Provenza.

15:27.890 --> 15:32.100
Uh, would you please call buzz and, uh,
and send everyone over to this gas station,

15:32.130 --> 15:33.640
check it out for signs
of a possible shooting,

15:33.650 --> 15:37.520
and see if there was a radio
call or a report made about it?

15:37.530 --> 15:38.680
- Thanks.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:38.690 --> 15:41.650
Miss, why don't you tell them about
the crimes that you are seeing?

15:41.690 --> 15:45.410
What crimes can we talk about with a guarantee
of protection? Have you thought about that?

15:45.790 --> 15:51.060
Ma'am, I assure you, the entire force is doing
everything we can to keep your neighborhood safe.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.330
I won't even take my
family out at night anymore.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.140
We're afraid to go out after dark.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.490
And that should not be the case.

15:57.510 --> 16:00.180
*********

16:00.210 --> 16:04.900
So tonight, we have two of the officers
here who patrol your neighborhood.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.150
Standing there at the
back after the meeting,

16:07.180 --> 16:11.520
feel free to address any specific
concerns you may have with them.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.910
- Did you guys find anything yet?
- Not yet.

16:26.090 --> 16:28.980
Buzz. Over here.

16:28.990 --> 16:31.090
I think I found something.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.090
.32 caliber.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.570
We got three more over here.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.410
You want to get this, buzz?

16:39.680 --> 16:42.870
Two in here, and you got one down here.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.280
Lieutenant tao...

16:59.290 --> 17:02.690
Do you still carry
around those geeky lasers?

17:06.869 --> 17:11.000
I-I promise we're gonna do everything
we can to find out why this happened.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.950
I hope so, chief johnson.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.849
And not just for my sake.

17:16.890 --> 17:18.890
People here need to believe in you.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.810
They need to know you're
going to do something.

17:21.819 --> 17:24.310
They need to see it.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.480
Please.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.710
Yeah.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.300
- Chief.
- Yes.

17:35.310 --> 17:37.070
I just talked to flynn.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.370
No report was filed on any shooting
last night at that food and gas mart,

17:40.410 --> 17:44.030
but there was a 911
reported from their phone.

17:44.060 --> 17:47.220
Caller said shots were
fired. Patrol car was sent.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.030
No one was there, so they
kept going. Now, get this.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.530
Flynn says they just foundsome .
32 casings in their parking lot.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.630
- Okay.
- You need to be shaking hands with people.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.910
Not you, lieutenant.

17:57.950 --> 18:00.340
Uh, I need to run out
just for one quick minute.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.370
No, no, no, no, chief johnson,
you're not going anywhere right now.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.230
There's some
casings --

18:04.260 --> 18:07.820
you cannot invite these people here
to meet you a-and then just leave.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.970
Chief, why don't you just -- you
stay here and press the flesh,

18:11.010 --> 18:14.250
and I'll keep you posted
on anything going on.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.500
Here we go.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.580
Hey, julio. We're ready.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.340
Okay. Flynn, are you in position?

18:44.350 --> 18:45.760
I'm at the community center.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.290
- Okay. Are you ready to film this?
- All set.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.480
Okay, lieutenant tao, point it
away from your body like a gun

18:51.490 --> 18:54.810
and go to your left towards
flynn at the community center.

18:57.710 --> 19:02.950
Okay. Good. Keep going. Good. Good.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.310
Tao, julio, are you guys still
there? I don't see anything yet.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.700
Tao... lower it just a little.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.960
Oh, I see it now.

19:23.990 --> 19:27.240
It's hitting me, and I'm right
where reggie was standing.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.650
Tao, I see a direct path for the
bullet that killed reggie gray.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.140
Looks like he was shot in
somebody else's gunfight.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.910
What kind of sense does that make?

19:49.020 --> 19:51.340
I mean, come on.

20:23.730 --> 20:26.200
Sure is quiet in here.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.490
Doesn't have to be this quiet, you know?

20:32.260 --> 20:36.630
We could use this bedroom for something
other than your unsolved cases.

20:36.660 --> 20:41.380
After last night, this room may not be
big enough for my unsolved cases, honestly.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.680
But it could hold a kid.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.820
We could turn this room
into a nursery in just...

20:48.630 --> 20:51.710
a few months maybe.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.670
You should have seen my
victim's mother last night.

20:59.700 --> 21:03.260
She stood up and talked about
how much she loved her son.

21:03.580 --> 21:08.660
She never gave up on him
through prison and parole.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.570
She was helping him
turn his life around.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.110
And then one night...

21:16.710 --> 21:21.410
shot dead, probably
by a-a random bullet,

21:21.880 --> 21:26.150
for no better reason than he was just
standing in the wrong place at the wrong time.

21:27.090 --> 21:30.680
When I know how easily...

21:30.880 --> 21:36.690
these things happen, how can I
even think about having children?

21:37.900 --> 21:40.890
The same way E.R.Doctors do...

21:42.010 --> 21:45.930
and undertakers... and soldiers.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.390
And you could ask the same
question about getting married.

21:49.410 --> 21:54.170
How many times have you stepped up to some
poor woman to say her husband isn't coming home?

21:54.190 --> 21:56.530
And we still said "I do."

21:56.560 --> 21:58.860
That I couldn't help.

22:00.140 --> 22:03.500
You're so great at imaging the worst.

22:03.980 --> 22:06.870
That's part of why
you're good at your job.

22:06.880 --> 22:11.490
But try, just... for a minute...

22:13.540 --> 22:16.240
imagining something better.

22:18.690 --> 22:20.260
911. What's your emergency?

22:20.270 --> 22:22.330
Yeah. These guys are in
a parking lot, fighting.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.740
Someone just fired a gun.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.070
Hold on, sir. What's your name?

22:25.080 --> 22:27.460
- Tommy martinez.
- What's your location, tommy?

22:27.470 --> 22:30.300
20th and crenshaw -- the
central food and gas mart.

22:30.330 --> 22:32.920
Okay, tommy, I'm going to
dispatch a unit to your location.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.670
Stay on the line, please.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.470
Wait, wait, wait. I
think they're leaving.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.020
Hello? Are you still there?

22:39.030 --> 22:41.540
I'm still here. The
patrol car is coming.

22:42.970 --> 22:47.170
That was very brave of you to make
that call, tommy, so thank you for that.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.180
What else can you tell
me about that night?

22:50.190 --> 22:53.470
The boys in the parking lot...

22:54.020 --> 22:56.280
how many were there?

22:56.300 --> 22:58.070
I don't remember.

22:58.090 --> 23:00.630
Do you remember who fired the gun?

23:00.650 --> 23:02.740
I didn't see anything.
I just heard shots.

23:02.750 --> 23:05.280
Were they older than you? Younger?

23:06.460 --> 23:12.210
Listen, lady, the only reason I took this
job is so I could save up money for college.

23:12.220 --> 23:17.170
That call I made -- that's just
'cause there was kids around.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.230
So why don't you leave me alone?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.690
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

23:20.720 --> 23:25.160
I wouldn't be asking you these questions if it
wasn't a matter of life and death for someone.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.750
Life and death.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.280
Okay, look...

23:33.230 --> 23:37.490
I saw a guy with a nice
cadillac, screaming...

23:37.510 --> 23:39.870
at some other guys to get
away from it. That's it.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.530
Did they threaten him
or try to shoot him?

23:42.550 --> 23:46.490
No, no, no. The guy in -- in the car
-- he's the one who fired the gun.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.610
I thought you said you didn't see that.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.450
All right.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.550
I'll tell you about the guy in
the car that -- that shot his gun.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.080
But I'm not gonna say anything
to you about those gangsters.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.620
If they knew that I was sitting here
talking to you, they'd come after me.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.540
Come on, man. You know. Tell her.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.520
What gang?

24:15.470 --> 24:18.590
N.D.S.Two of them.

24:18.940 --> 24:23.180
I don't know their names, but, uh, I
recognized their faces from the neighborhood.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.810
N.D.S are the 19th street destroyers.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.900
It's the affirmative-action
gang I was telling you about.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.990
Um, they have a big chop-shop
operation, mostly high-end car parts.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.060
You recognized these boys?

24:38.950 --> 24:44.900
Okay. How about this --
what color was the cadillac?

24:47.300 --> 24:49.840
Look, tommy, I understand that
growing up in your neighborhood,

24:49.850 --> 24:55.020
you must get really good at
imagining how bad things can be.

24:55.030 --> 24:59.470
But... try...

25:00.160 --> 25:03.870
just for a minute, to
imagine something better.

25:06.110 --> 25:11.730
Because that's what we're trying to do --
make a safer place for you and your family.

25:12.460 --> 25:16.580
You can make a difference. You can.

25:26.310 --> 25:28.660
How about this instead?

25:32.620 --> 25:35.870
I wrote down the license-plate
number of the cadillac.

25:39.290 --> 25:44.400
You -- you wrote down the license-plate number,
and -- and you didn't show it to the police?

25:44.410 --> 25:45.950
I never had a chance.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.890
By the time you guys got
there, everyone was gone.

25:48.900 --> 25:52.790
Cops just... rolled through.
They didn't even stop.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.650
Don't look so surprised, lady.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.310
See, that's the way you always do us.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.560
His name is kelvin blake.

26:05.580 --> 26:08.200
Registered owner of the vehicle. Age 38.

26:08.210 --> 26:12.320
He lives over on arlington, about a
mile and a half from the service station.

26:12.350 --> 26:14.670
Honestly, chief, seems like a nice guy.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.350
Who has a rap sheet, even
though it's from 20 years ago.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.650
Still -- drugs,
petty theft.

26:21.670 --> 26:25.110
Works as a foreman for m&f
construction company now.

26:25.130 --> 26:27.880
Employed there for the last 10 years.

26:27.890 --> 26:31.600
So at least kelvin can hold down a job,
and he turned in his gun voluntarily.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.510
- Thank you.
- Ballistics finished their report.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.210
The bullet that killed
reggie came from that gun.

26:36.230 --> 26:38.360
Still doesn't prove
he pulled the trigger.

26:38.370 --> 26:39.870
- Chief johnson...
- yes.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.680
I spoke to my robbery guys.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.310
There's been a string of high-end
carjackings recently within a few miles

26:45.320 --> 26:47.110
of father jack's community center.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.690
I bet mostly with the N.D.S.

26:48.710 --> 26:52.650
So, uh, you think this kelvin blake
guy's responsible for the shooting?

26:52.970 --> 26:56.110
Well, hopefully, we'll know soon enough.

26:57.310 --> 26:58.540
- Chief.
- Yes.

26:58.550 --> 27:03.260
I talked tommy into unofficially I.D.Ing
the two gangsters from the parking lot,

27:03.270 --> 27:05.440
enrique santos and alonso garcia.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.660
How'd you do that?

27:06.690 --> 27:08.370
Put together some photo lineups.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.270
And I told him, "if our shooter
here picks out the same guys,

27:11.280 --> 27:13.060
you would never have to go to courT."

27:13.080 --> 27:14.850
And he believed you?

27:14.860 --> 27:17.300
Why do people ever talk to us?

27:17.810 --> 27:20.980
All right. Uh, thank you. These,
uh -- these will be very helpful.

27:20.990 --> 27:25.790
Now, if you and lieutenant flynn could
track down mr. Santos and mr. Garcia,

27:25.800 --> 27:27.510
bring them in there, thank you.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.110
Yes, ma'am.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.950
Good evening, mr. Blake.
I'm deputy chief johnson.

27:35.960 --> 27:40.000
I want to thank you so much for being
so cooperative with my detectives.

27:40.010 --> 27:41.440
I'm happy to help out.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.640
Tell you the truth, you know,
these gangsters -- they got friends.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.870
I'd rather just forget
about the whole thing.

27:45.890 --> 27:49.770
Well, unfortunately, sir, discharging a
firearm in a public place is against the law.

27:49.790 --> 27:53.610
So just forgetting about the
whole thing isn't an option.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.850
I understand you were read
and waived your rights.

27:57.870 --> 28:01.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I -- I
was just protecting myself.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.410
Why don't you start by walking us
through what happened last friday night?

28:05.080 --> 28:09.040
Okay. I got off work late.

28:09.050 --> 28:13.190
Didn't feel like making dinner, so I thought
I'd go by the gas mart and grab a hot dog.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.700
And what time was that?

28:15.390 --> 28:17.700
9:00. Little after 9:00.

28:18.270 --> 28:20.650
Okay. And so?

28:20.660 --> 28:22.250
So I pulled in.

28:22.280 --> 28:27.850
And I'm standing at the register when I look out
and I see two boys coming from across the street.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.650
And I-I recognized the look on their
faces, 'cause it's my hood, right?

28:30.680 --> 28:34.090
And I'm thinking, "I got to get
back in my car before they steal it."

28:34.130 --> 28:37.340
So I ran out, jumped
in the driver's seat.

28:37.390 --> 28:40.120
But they stood behind me. See,
they wouldn't let me back out.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.560
Did they threaten you in any way?

28:41.570 --> 28:44.930
Yes! They told me to get out of the car.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.880
This is the gun that, uh...

28:47.890 --> 28:49.620
you gave my detectives, correct?

28:49.640 --> 28:51.300
Yes, ma'am.

28:51.800 --> 28:56.190
I mean, I knew people were gonna be
after my car. I mean, the rims alone.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.850
I just thought I needed a
little firepower to hold onto it.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.860
So, wait, you bought a car that you
thought you needed a gun to hang on to?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.630
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Let's just -- let's just back up.

29:05.640 --> 29:10.710
You got to understand, I mean, I worked my
whole life to be able to have a car like that.

29:10.740 --> 29:14.050
There was no way I was gonna let them
gangsters take my cadillac from me.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.990
I mean, you would have done
the same thing, right, man?

29:16.020 --> 29:19.320
Just... what happened next, sir?

29:19.740 --> 29:21.480
So they told me to get out the car.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.940
So I did, only they didn't
know I was armed, you know?

29:24.970 --> 29:28.220
So right away, I point the gun
at them. I told them to back off.

29:28.230 --> 29:34.200
They just laugh at me, like -- like I'm
joking, tell me to give them my keys or else.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.230
One of them said, "homey, I'm
gonna look great in your car."

29:37.250 --> 29:40.040
I thought, "the hell
you are," so I just...

29:40.050 --> 29:43.160
capped off a few
rounds over their heads.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.510
And what did they do?

29:44.540 --> 29:49.610
They ran, both of them, talking about
"I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you."

29:53.570 --> 29:56.720
I want you to think about
this very carefully, kelvin.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.190
What was going on in your mind
when you pulled out the gun?

30:02.450 --> 30:06.750
I was afraid, you
know? I'm still afraid.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.960
I mean, I got to drive
down that street every day.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.810
I knew they'd probably remember
what I look like and my car.

30:12.820 --> 30:14.550
I knew they'd remember that, too.

30:14.560 --> 30:18.470
Probably come and find
me, just like you guys did.

30:18.480 --> 30:23.900
Which is why it's so important that you identify
these men so that they can't come and find you.

30:26.300 --> 30:31.150
So if you could, um, please
take a look at these gentlemen,

30:31.160 --> 30:33.930
tell me if you recognize anyone.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.260
Yeah, that's one of them right there.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.080
That's the other one.

30:44.090 --> 30:47.770
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

30:47.780 --> 30:51.260
Okay. Thanks.

30:58.420 --> 31:02.430
So, kelvin, tell me, um,
when you fired those rounds,

31:02.470 --> 31:05.620
did you ever wonder where
they were gonna end up?

31:07.790 --> 31:10.550
No.

31:11.390 --> 31:15.000
Why? What happened?

31:15.690 --> 31:21.570
When you shot at those boys, one of the bullets
went on for a while -- two whole blocks --

31:21.580 --> 31:24.100
and ended up in the back
of the head of a man ...

31:24.110 --> 31:25.710
- by the name of reggie gray.
- No, no, no.

31:25.720 --> 31:29.310
- He died instantly.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

31:30.510 --> 31:33.750
Oh, my
god!Oh, my --

31:35.590 --> 31:41.190
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt
nobody. I didn't mean -- oh, my god!

31:41.760 --> 31:45.500
Oh, man! Did he have a family? Did he...

31:56.370 --> 31:58.230
******

31:58.260 --> 32:01.620
So, sanchez and i spent all night
looking for these two dirtbags.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.950
We finally found them this morning,
walking up to the same service station.

32:04.970 --> 32:07.160
Probably gonna jack another car.

32:07.660 --> 32:08.410
What's this?

32:08.420 --> 32:13.720
We can now monitor the electronics room
and the interview room from out here...

32:14.020 --> 32:16.510
and from two angles.

32:16.550 --> 32:20.020
Or just one. Or this one.

32:20.970 --> 32:23.950
And it's wireless. Pretty cool, huh?

32:23.960 --> 32:26.590
Tao, would you stop moving
the picture around, damn it?

32:26.620 --> 32:29.890
Y-you're making me
dizzy. Settle somewhere.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.770
- Man, I want something to eat.
- Yeah.

32:33.230 --> 32:34.910
I'm not your waiter.

32:34.940 --> 32:36.870
You have the right to remain silent.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.190
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

32:40.220 --> 32:44.000
- You have the right to an attorney.If you can't afford a lawyer...
- It's, like, amazing.

32:44.010 --> 32:45.070
excuse me for a minute.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.730
Settle someplace, tao!
Now I'm not kidding!

32:48.600 --> 32:51.250
Did you understand what I just told you?

32:54.350 --> 32:57.120
Alonso and enrique's rap sheets.

32:57.150 --> 33:01.140
And we just got positive I.D.S on both of
them for three other recent carjackings --

33:01.150 --> 33:03.580
one at the same gas
station a few weeks ago.

33:04.030 --> 33:05.290
Thank you, sergeant.

33:05.320 --> 33:09.110
Let's see what our busy little
gangsters have to say for themselves.

33:12.870 --> 33:15.580
Gentlemen... thank you
so much for joining us.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.540
Stand up.

33:17.910 --> 33:20.700
- You're welcome, bitcH.
- Well...

33:20.710 --> 33:22.590
so much for hello.

33:22.600 --> 33:27.040
Do you have any idea why we
asked you to pop by here today?

33:27.660 --> 33:28.830
Alonso?

33:28.860 --> 33:30.520
You want to have my baby?

33:31.860 --> 33:35.290
I'll tell you this one time.
You better show some respect!

33:35.300 --> 33:38.370
Or else. Stand here.

33:39.470 --> 33:42.680
Let's, uh -- let's
start over, shall we?

33:43.220 --> 33:47.410
Uh, I believe that you gentlemen were shot
at in the parking lot at the central food

33:47.440 --> 33:51.320
and gas mart on crenshaw
the night before last.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.650
Does that ring any bells?

33:55.410 --> 33:57.740
Uh, lieutenant...

33:58.790 --> 34:01.400
I think we found the
guy who shot at you.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.110
That's why you're here.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.790
- Y-you talking about that fool?
- Do you recognize him, enrique?

34:07.350 --> 34:09.810
Yeah, the crazy bastard was at the
filling station the other night.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.330
He was waving his gun around,
shouting some bullshit.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.969
But we left after he started shooting.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.330
Shooting? At who?

34:16.340 --> 34:18.239
What do you mean, "at who"? At us.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.139
Now, why would this
man fire his gun at you?

34:21.469 --> 34:23.030
Did something happen?

34:23.090 --> 34:26.590
Did you maybe pay too much
attention to his brand-new cadillac?

34:26.610 --> 34:28.370
It's a nice car, yeah.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.360
But look, lady, he's the crazy one,

34:30.370 --> 34:32.989
pointing his shiny little piece at
us because we said we liked his car.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.989
What kind of a compliment
did you pay his vehicle?

34:37.460 --> 34:40.969
She means, "how did you
tell him you liked the car?"

34:42.650 --> 34:46.850
I just said, you know, "I'd look real
good driving that cadillac around."

34:46.860 --> 34:49.020
- 'Cause I would.
- I bet you would.

34:49.270 --> 34:52.000
Do you think that maybe that's what
this guy thought you were gonna do --

34:52.040 --> 34:54.440
jump in his car and drive off in it?

34:55.380 --> 34:56.610
Look, let me explain.

34:56.630 --> 34:59.520
Uh, as interested as I
normally am in grand theft,

34:59.550 --> 35:04.060
what I really want to know about
today is who killed reggie gray?

35:04.560 --> 35:05.220
Reggie who?

35:05.240 --> 35:10.920
The guy who was shot at the community
center last friday night by this man here.

35:12.040 --> 35:16.370
Oh, okay. Oh, you see? I
told you that dude was crazy.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.500
He tried killing us, too.
Isn't that against the law, huh?

35:18.510 --> 35:21.930
Yeah, he came after us. And I was gonna
mess him up, you know? I wanted to.But --

35:21.940 --> 35:25.620
well, you can forget all about settling
scores with him, because I'll be handling that.

35:25.650 --> 35:30.450
All I want to know from you boys
exactly what happened last friday night.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.990
Look, even if you were, say, trying
to drive off in this man's car,

35:36.010 --> 35:39.140
murder is the only
crime I care about today.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.120
Isn't that right, detective sanchez?

35:42.150 --> 35:44.980
We're asking you to help us deal
with this guy who shot at you.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.470
I mean, come on. How
often does that happen?

35:47.480 --> 35:53.080
I want to know about the moment
he started shooting at you, okay?

35:53.500 --> 35:55.650
- Yes?
- Okay.

35:55.660 --> 35:58.890
Look, we only said something about...

36:00.180 --> 36:02.520
about taking the car.
We didn't actually do it.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.070
And then that's when he pulled the gun.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.520
I'm surprised you didn't grab it
from him and shove it down his throat.

36:06.550 --> 36:08.570
Man, we thought about that,
you know, but then he started --

36:08.600 --> 36:11.380
bam, bam, bam!--
Just like that.

36:11.390 --> 36:12.900
You know, we knew he was serious.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.230
Tell her, man. Tell
her that's the truth.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.800
Sabes que we didn't even get in that car, and
that son of a bitch started shooting at us.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.620
Can you believe that?
We didn't even get in it.

36:19.630 --> 36:21.780
That's exactly what I thought happened.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.120
Now, if you could just,
uh, write it all down,

36:24.130 --> 36:27.540
just what you said and, uh,
sign it, and we'll be finished.

36:27.950 --> 36:28.790
Write what down?

36:28.820 --> 36:33.780
Just that you wanted to take this man's
car, and for no other reason than that,

36:33.820 --> 36:37.890
he illegally discharged his weapon at
you and that you, uh, fled the scene.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.000
Okay, wait a minute. Wait.

36:40.010 --> 36:43.410
Okay, we only tried to steal the car.

36:43.420 --> 36:46.110
- We didn't take it.
- I completely understand.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.940
In fact, just describe it that
way. Say it just like that.

36:48.950 --> 36:52.030
You only tried to steal this man's car.

36:52.060 --> 36:56.160
A-and underline the word "try" so
it's clear that it was just an attempt.

36:56.180 --> 36:58.470
That's a good idea.

37:08.050 --> 37:09.660
Why is the chief unhappy?

37:09.690 --> 37:13.650
That was the confession, wasn't it?
I mean, am I missing something here?

37:14.790 --> 37:18.780
She's probably already thinking about how she's
going to explain all of this to reggie's mom.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.230
You spelled "cadillac" wrong.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.890
It's two l'S.

37:22.910 --> 37:25.010
We rigged this up in a day.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.120
Imagine what we could do in a week.

37:27.140 --> 37:28.750
I'm breathless.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.130
Okay. Let me take a look at that.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.220
All right, uh, if you could
just sign on the bottom.

37:36.810 --> 37:38.020
All right, gentlemen.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.700
- I put the date right there, too.
- Good idea.

37:41.830 --> 37:45.850
Now, I-I should probably explain
the, uh, felony murder rule to you.

37:45.870 --> 37:48.500
Oh, we don't care about that. As
long as you got that fool, we're good.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.350
I'm starving.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.250
No, no, no, you really ought to understand
about your future responsibilities

37:52.260 --> 37:53.720
in regards to reggie gray.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.820
What responsibilities? We didn't
agree to any responsibility.

37:55.830 --> 37:57.820
S-shut up, alonso.

37:57.850 --> 38:00.040
I got to eat, okay? Can't this wait?

38:00.050 --> 38:02.600
I hate to hold you up, but, um...

38:02.880 --> 38:04.820
you really should understand
what's gonna happen next,

38:04.850 --> 38:09.840
because when you're involved in a robbery,
like only trying to steal this man's cadillac,

38:09.870 --> 38:12.080
and someone gets shot
during that attempt,

38:12.110 --> 38:14.860
whether the victim is right in
front of you or two blocks away,

38:14.900 --> 38:19.910
if that person dies as a result
of your actions, it's murder.

38:20.370 --> 38:22.210
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.

38:22.220 --> 38:24.690
So we're like witnesses now or what?

38:24.720 --> 38:26.750
- Only if you decide to testify.
- All right.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.200
Y-you're telling me
we got to go to court?

38:28.230 --> 38:31.550
I'm afraid so. But you don't have
to testify if you don't want to,

38:31.560 --> 38:34.050
- because that's a right that you have under the 5th amendment.
- Yeah.

38:34.060 --> 38:37.420
Don't worry. Your lawyer
will explain it all to you.

38:37.430 --> 38:39.440
No, wait. Lawyers? We
can't afford no lawyers.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.550
I told you, if you can't afford an
attorney, one will be appointed for you.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.480
- Enrique santos and alonso garcia...
- w-w-wait, what's going on here?

38:44.490 --> 38:45.630
- You're both under arrest for murder.
- What are you doing?

38:45.640 --> 38:46.930
- Get off me!
- Hands down, too.

38:46.940 --> 38:50.120
You'll figure it all out by
the time you're arraigned.

38:51.150 --> 38:54.100
Looky here. Now she's
starting to perk up.

38:54.110 --> 38:55.850
Oh, and, uh, if you
boys are still hungry,

38:55.870 --> 38:59.410
I'm sure we can rustle you up some
bologna sandwiches and powdered eggs.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.280
And I hope you like them,
because where you're going,

39:01.310 --> 39:02.660
that's all you're gonna eat
for the rest of your lives.

39:02.670 --> 39:06.440
Wait, wait. Hey, you
get back here, you bitch!

39:13.650 --> 39:16.640
So, you think mrs. Gray's gonna be okay?

39:16.650 --> 39:21.680
I think you defined "transferred intent" and
"felony murder" as well as anyone could have.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.890
Guiding her through
the mourning process --

39:23.900 --> 39:27.650
- well, that's more my job than yours.
- Yeah. It's just as well.

39:27.660 --> 39:32.160
Having your child shot dead because someone
was trying to steal a car two blocks away

39:32.170 --> 39:34.080
seems awfully random to me.

39:34.110 --> 39:37.450
I wouldn't say that, no.

39:37.860 --> 39:43.140
Please don't tell me you think that reggie's
murder was, what, part of god's grand design?

39:44.270 --> 39:47.680
"God's grand design." That's
a little bit over my head.

39:47.690 --> 39:50.690
But I don't believe in random.

39:52.230 --> 39:55.770
But there was no motive
in reggie's death.

39:55.790 --> 39:58.290
And -- and where there's no
motive, there's no meaning.

39:58.320 --> 40:02.330
Well, you only think there's no
meaning 'cause you're looking for it.

40:02.370 --> 40:05.660
But meaning isn't something
you find, chief johnson.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.060
It's something you give.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.260
Making sense out of reggie's
murder -- well, that's up to us.

40:13.230 --> 40:16.480
So what meaning would you say it had?

40:34.930 --> 40:39.540
Well, I'd say that reggie's death had brought
this community closer together, don't you think?

40:39.550 --> 40:43.090
Including the neighborhood
and the police.

40:43.450 --> 40:45.940
Including you and me.

41:15.580 --> 41:18.170
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

41:19.820 --> 41:22.340
I can't believe you're falling for this.

41:23.100 --> 41:25.750
What's a little paint, huh?

41:30.410 --> 41:31.940
It's not gonna change anything.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.650
And tomorrow or next week, this wall's
gonna be covered in graffiti again.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.680
Well, until then...
