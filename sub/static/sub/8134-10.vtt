[Isabelle]  <i> Previously</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:08.307
Got a lot of stuff
to work on here.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.675
Like controlling my
murderous tendencies.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.044
Detective Garroway, I need
your badge and your gun.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.846
Who's this?
[Vargas] His name is Fisk.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.314
<i> Internal affairs.</i>
Look familiar?

00:15.316 --> 00:17.449
Meliorn, the Clave has
ordered that you be
placed under arrest.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.651
We rule with our heads,
not with our hearts.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.653
I'm in.
Please, just let Meliorn go.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.788
You couldn't
possibly understand--

00:22.790 --> 00:24.256
It's you that doesn't
understand, Alec.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.193
We'll fight
Valentine together.
No.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.461
[Meliorn]  <i> You</i>
<i> spearheaded my rescue.</i>

00:29.463 --> 00:32.097
I'm offering you
a gift. I can help
you find your father.

00:46.013 --> 00:48.680
[Clary] Toto, we're
not in Kansas anymore.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.717
[Meliorn] Welcome
to the Seelie Glade,
Clary Fairchild.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.185
The remotest edges of it.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.653
[Clary] How did we get here?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.989
[Jace] There are entrances
all through the mundane world.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.991
[Meliorn] You just have to
know where to look.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.360
Why did we have to come
here to find my father?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.895
Because of your necklace.

01:03.697 --> 01:04.930
It's a Portal shard.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.298
Tell us something
we don't know.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.434
How does it work?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.402
When I touch the crystal
and I think of someone,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.671
I can see where they are.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.939
I'm curious, Shadowhunter,
who knows so much about
Portals,

01:14.942 --> 01:16.275
did you never wonder why

01:16.277 --> 01:19.511
this Portal shard
doesn't behave the way
normal Portals do?

01:21.882 --> 01:24.917
Normal Portals
can only take you
to places you've been.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.585
I guess I never
really thought about it.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.421
I see Isabelle is the
smart one in the family.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.524
Your Portal shard
works the way it does

01:32.526 --> 01:34.560
because it's a piece
of a Portal from
another dimension.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.361
Another dimension?

01:36.363 --> 01:38.597
You're saying
there's a Portal in
some other universe

01:38.599 --> 01:40.365
that can take us to anyone
if we just think of them?

01:40.367 --> 01:42.367
If you can find
the only Portal

01:42.369 --> 01:44.269
still standing in
that dimension...

01:44.271 --> 01:45.504
it will take you
to your father.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.043
Then they put Jace in, and
that can't be, you know...

01:51.045 --> 01:52.578
Just, hold on one second.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.113
Where the hell have you been?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.280
Where I needed to be.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.549
Away from you
and your fiancee.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.718
Jace and Clary are on the run.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.386
I can't protect
you if you don't
tell me the truth.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.222
I don't need protecting.

02:03.224 --> 02:06.325
Meliorn's alive.
That's all that matters.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.993
Just... Hey, just...

02:07.995 --> 02:09.761
[sighs]
...tell me this.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.866
Is there any way that
Raj could have seen
anything incriminating?

02:15.136 --> 02:17.669
I don't think you
can call it an attack
if no one got injured.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.638
We were ambushed.
How is that possible?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.074
Nobody outside the Institute
knew about the mission.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.276
It was dark.
We couldn't see much.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.579
There were wolves...
and the others were
hit with vampires.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.748
But I swear,
the one that got me...

02:30.618 --> 02:32.384
moved a lot like
a Shadowhunter.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.257
[Meliorn] These trees are
where the alternate dimensions

02:38.259 --> 02:39.725
intersect the Seelie realm.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.192
[Jace] How is it possible
that the Clave doesn't know

02:41.195 --> 02:43.028
about your
dimensional doorways?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.930
They are our most
guarded secret.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.999
We are their protectors.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.667
Only Seelies know
of their existence.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.302
[Clary] Then why
are you telling us?

02:50.304 --> 02:53.939
I owe you a life debt...
and I don't like being
indebted to anyone.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.808
What would happen if--

02:55.809 --> 02:57.676
If the Seelie Queen finds out
I've shared this with you?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.112
I could be executed.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.082
Well, we'll be
extra careful then.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.351
There is no "we"
in this scenario.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.321
Only Clary goes in
to find the Portal.
My debt is to her.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.023
You've given us no reason
to trust you, Seelie.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.425
He brought us here.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.632
[energy pulsating]

03:32.079 --> 03:34.580
I knew the Seelies were
one with nature, but...

03:39.820 --> 03:42.721
[Meliorn] This will
establish a connection
to the other dimension.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.359
What's it like?
The other dimension.
Is it like this one?

03:47.361 --> 03:49.194
It is...

03:49.196 --> 03:50.762
but it isn't.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.331
Could you be more vague?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.500
It is an alternate
timeline, in a sense.

03:55.502 --> 03:59.271
There, Shadowhunters and
demons no longer exist.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.372
What?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.540
And Downworlders
have conformed

04:01.542 --> 04:04.176
to the mundane way of
life to avoid detection.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.510
What happened to
the Shadowhunters?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.346
Their services were
no longer required,

04:07.348 --> 04:10.082
because they won the
war against the demons,
centuries ago.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.853
Once they sealed the rifts
between their worlds...
[inhales deeply]

04:14.855 --> 04:16.021
their culture faded away.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.290
Once you arrive in the
alternate dimension,

04:18.292 --> 04:21.059
you will assume the body of
the Clary in that world.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.961
You will think and
feel just like her.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.197
But I'll still
know I'm me, right?

04:25.199 --> 04:26.999
I'll know I have
to find the Portal?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.801
There's a catch.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.137
With Seelies,
there's always a catch.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.474
Your alternate self could
consume you if you let it.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.942
Is there a way to not let it?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.110
[straining]

04:38.946 --> 04:42.414
Focus on the differences
between that world and ours.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.817
Find something or someone to
keep you grounded to this one.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.719
Easy enough.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.988
It will be more
difficult than you think.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.957
If you don't hurry,
you could cease

04:51.959 --> 04:53.792
to be this world's
Clary Fairchild.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.995
And be stuck in
that world forever.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.011
What am I supposed to do?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.080
Just sit on my hands
if Clary needs help?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.748
Let the pack handle it.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.250
We can't afford to lose
our leader right now,

05:18.252 --> 05:19.818
with everything
that's going on

05:19.820 --> 05:21.186
with the Shadow
World and Valentine.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.854
I promised Jocelyn
I'd look after her.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.891
When you killed Theo,
you promised to take
care of this pack.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.694
But you can't do that
if you're locked up
in internal affairs

05:28.696 --> 05:30.562
or being sucked
dry by some vampire.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.498
[both sniffing]

05:35.536 --> 05:36.835
There's something
dead outside.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.076
[low growling]

05:45.546 --> 05:47.512
What are you doing here?
[clears throat]

05:47.514 --> 05:50.148
Raphael has appointed me
ambassador to the werewolves.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.783
Why the hell
would you do that?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.587
Because of my close personal
connection with Luke.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.358
[growling continues]

05:59.360 --> 06:00.592
Enough!

06:01.662 --> 06:03.261
[growling subsides]

06:06.066 --> 06:07.366
[clears throat]

06:08.535 --> 06:09.868
Give us a minute.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.974
I thought me and
Alaric were cool.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.076
You were. [sighs]

06:18.078 --> 06:19.945
Then I became Nerdferatu.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.815
You know, I thought
we were one.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.717
Allies, brothers in
arms and all that.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.754
Yeah, it's not that simple.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.423
Because vampires and
werewolves hate each other?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.659
Not all vampires
and werewolves.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.730
[indistinct low growl]

06:41.335 --> 06:43.402
So, why did you
really come here?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.437
Raphael is not the
most patient trainer
in the Shadow World.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.506
[chuckles] What happened?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.608
He got frustrated with
my training and told me
to take a walk.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.576
And you decided to
go to the one place

06:51.578 --> 06:53.812
where you could get
torn apart by wild dogs?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.181
Seemed like a good
idea at the time.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.949
[chuckling]

07:01.054 --> 07:02.988
I was ordered to
bring you these.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.323
[chuckles]

07:08.629 --> 07:12.164
So, let me guess,
your training stalled
somewhere around here?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.865
Emotions running hot?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.867
Anything and everything
makes you wanna vamp out?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.036
It's like... it's like
going through puberty
all over again.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.538
Just with less zits.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.441
Mmm. It's the same way
with new werewolves.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.045
I just need to
be sure it's safe.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.781
Just in case I
don't make it back.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.533
You're coming back.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.284
What do either of us know
about interdimensional travel?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.788
Little bit.
Not helping.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.624
It's time.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.929
Meliorn, I appreciate
the risk you're taking,

07:43.931 --> 07:46.465
but a life debt requires
you ensure my safety.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.436
I'll agree to go alone...

07:51.438 --> 07:53.104
but if I find this
alternate Portal,

07:53.106 --> 07:55.907
I won't be able to face
Valentine on my own.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.008
She'll need backup.

07:59.413 --> 08:03.915
[sighs] If you find
the Portal, you may
come back for him.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.485
Shadowhunters need Seelie
permission to go through.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.653
Only demons can
pass through unaided.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.359

<i> I'll help you find your way.</i>

10:52.786 --> 10:54.686
[cutlery clatters]
[gasps]

10:57.958 --> 10:59.324
I have to go.
What?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.792
I thought you were spending
the morning with us.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.527
I, uh, have a last
minute assignment due

11:02.529 --> 11:04.195
that I haven't even
started yet, so...

11:04.197 --> 11:05.330
[stutters] I gotta go.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.498
Well, we'll see
you tonight, right?

11:07.467 --> 11:08.600
Clarissa?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.705
I'm sorry.
For what?

11:20.113 --> 11:22.047
Isabelle Lightwood,
by order of the Clave,

11:22.049 --> 11:23.782
you are under
arrest for high treason.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.850
What? On what grounds?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.286
Only a handful of people
knew about the Meliorn op.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.954
And everyone knows
she's sleeping with him.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.356
[chuckles]

11:34.027 --> 11:36.961
You know what, Lydia?
You're no better
than Valentine.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.398
But at least he had the
guts to tell Downworlders
to their faces

11:40.400 --> 11:42.300
he wanted them all dead.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.468
You...

11:43.470 --> 11:45.136
hide behind the Law.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.974
I don't hide
behind it, Isabelle.
I simply follow it.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.877
Because it guards against
one very important thing.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.880
Shadowhunters fighting
other Shadowhunters.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.551
If she is convicted,
she'll be stripped of
her runes and banished.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.820
I can't let that--
Don't.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.889
It's not your fight.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.101
Hey. Where have you been?
[gasps]

12:16.103 --> 12:17.335
We've been texting you
for, like, 20 minutes.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.170
Simon, get out of the sun.
Hey, what the hell?

12:21.608 --> 12:23.241
I know that look.
[sighs]

12:23.844 --> 12:24.909
Caffeine deprivation.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.011
Come on, Tweek.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.947
Simon, I do not have time
for coffee today.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.515
No, no, no.
I know that look in your eye.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.684
And when you get that look,
I either have to caffeinate
you immediately

12:32.686 --> 12:34.786
or accept full responsibility
for you killing someone.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.522
And you know how
I am with blood.
[grimaces]

12:37.524 --> 12:38.923
[chuckles]

12:39.526 --> 12:40.592
Is that new?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.762
Yes, I got it a
couple days ago.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.296
Oh, it goes with your dress?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.932
Because you're getting ready
at my place tonight, right?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.934
Ready for what?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.936
That is not even
a little bit funny.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.106
I have poured my heart
and soul into planning

12:55.108 --> 12:58.710
this anniversary
party for the Institute.
And the theme is amazing.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.211
Mmm.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.446
Here you go, buddy.
[Simon] Thanks, man.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.547
This one's for Clary.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.848
She's here?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.684
But, seriously, what is with
this guy and the Mad Hatter?

13:07.654 --> 13:09.487
Visionaries are quirky crazy.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.056
You don't get 4D Internet tech
thinking inside the box.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.392
I'm beginning to wonder
if you don't have
a thing for your boss.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.493
[Isabelle chuckles]

13:15.495 --> 13:17.729
Like, if Clary's dad
would ever go for me.

13:17.731 --> 13:18.763
Wait, my dad?

13:18.765 --> 13:19.898
Uh... [scoffs]

13:19.900 --> 13:21.166
No, I'm totally kidding.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.101
[stammers] I mean,
I'm not crushing
on your dad, right?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.803
No.
Right, of course not.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.004
That'd be totally weird.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.172
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.773
[breathes deeply]

13:28.775 --> 13:30.108
Order's up.
Hi.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.309
We're setting up
at 6:00, right?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.013
Yeah, okay. I need your
help tonight... loading.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.482
This gig could be...
huge for me.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.751
[softly] Hey.
Hey.

13:39.753 --> 13:40.852
You wanna get out of here?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.554
Sure.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.722
[stammers]

13:53.099 --> 13:54.566
[softly] I can't
wait till tonight.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.835
[stammers] For the party?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.270
Just shut up and kiss me.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.505
[Clary chuckles]

14:08.782 --> 14:10.515
[horn blares]
[gasps]

14:14.821 --> 14:15.954
[gasps] Stop!

14:15.956 --> 14:17.689
[stammers] I'm sorry, I can't.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.891
Clary.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.128
It's funny how similar
werewolves and vampires are.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.231
Makes you wonder why
we can't get along.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.234
So, Clary getting us
to fight together was--

14:29.236 --> 14:31.135
It was practically a miracle.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.137
It says a lot about who
she could be as a leader.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.305
She's got moxie.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.907
She'll be all right.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.008
Because she's with Jace?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.309
No.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.745
Because she's a fighter.
Like her mom.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.147
She'll fight her way
back to us if she has to.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.050
Well, not that
this Downworlder
thing isn't fun...

14:46.987 --> 14:48.720
but it's not.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.954
I just wanna go home.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.241
You can't.

14:53.242 --> 14:55.459
Not until you
control your impulses.
You understand me?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.929
Just keep practicing.
Okay.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.931
[Fisk] Luke Garroway.
Don't move.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.100
Here we go. Okay.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.668
Just do what he says.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.236
Shut up!

15:05.238 --> 15:06.304
Turn around.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.573
Nice and slow.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.575
That's it.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.078
You didn't think you
could hide forever,
did you, Garroway?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.213
I figured I'd try.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.315
We'll put this one down
as an epic fail, then.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.684
I'm takin' you in.
[low growl]

15:19.686 --> 15:20.752
Calm, Simon.
[Fisk] You, too.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.687
[Luke] Simon...

15:24.024 --> 15:25.723
Stay where you are.
[Luke] Simon, no!

15:25.725 --> 15:27.458
[Fisk yells]
[gun fires]

15:35.535 --> 15:37.702
I was ready to
rip his throat out.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.570
How'd you stop me?

15:39.572 --> 15:40.772
Wolf reflexes.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.374
Who the hell is this guy?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.876
Internal affairs.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.878
Thinks I killed my captain
and a couple other people

15:46.880 --> 15:48.813
connected to the
demonic murders.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.783
Did you?
Only one.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.119
Protecting Clary
from the Circle.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.221
Oh. Enough said.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.389
So, what now?

16:01.094 --> 16:02.627
If Clary doesn't make
it out of there soon,

16:02.629 --> 16:04.796
you're gonna be
meditating six feet under.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.633
Shadowhunter, have you ever
seen a Seelie knight fight?

16:09.736 --> 16:13.304
I wouldn't be so cocky about
your prowess if I were you.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.640
[low rumble]
[gasps]

16:22.082 --> 16:23.698
What's going on?

16:23.699 --> 16:25.315
Opening the doorway to
this dimension may not
have been a good idea.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.653
On a scale from
one to  <i> namaste,</i>
how screwed are we?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.290
Demons are attracted
to this dimension.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.959
It's defenseless and peaceful.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.028
They like chaos and havoc.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.099
All right, pointy ears,
looks like yoga
time might be over.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.939
[Magnus] The Lovers.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.409
You are in a
loving relationship.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.344
[inhales deeply]

16:53.346 --> 16:55.580
This man has a
strong hold on you.

16:56.216 --> 17:00.084
You feel a magnetic attraction
to him that you cannot escape.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.721
Tonight will define
your relationship.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.025
Oh. [chuckles]

17:07.027 --> 17:09.093
You hope he is your soul mate.

17:12.132 --> 17:16.968
But secrets revealed
will threaten to
tear you apart.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.406
[cat meowing]

17:21.408 --> 17:22.573
[gasps]

17:24.644 --> 17:25.710
You don't have a cat.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.311
I have two.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.479
Chairman Meow...

17:28.481 --> 17:29.580
[meowing]

17:29.582 --> 17:31.315
[sighs]

17:31.317 --> 17:32.550
...and Church.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.751
[low growl]

17:35.055 --> 17:36.454
I'm not actually
here for a reading.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.390
I know you're a
warlock, Magnus.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.128
I'm a Shadowhunter.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.665
[laughs]

17:49.035 --> 17:50.868
There are no
more Shadowhunters.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.270
Haven't been for
hundreds of years.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.604
I can prove it.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.109
All I see, Shadowhunter...

17:58.945 --> 18:00.745
is you could
use a serious tan.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.582
[sighing] Right. Bad strategy.
No runes in this dimension.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.856
I'm from an alternate reality.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.258
If that were true...

18:15.128 --> 18:17.361
without an anchor, you'd be
assimilating into this world.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.831
[scoffs] Believe me,
I am trying to fight it.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.000
Which is part of
why I need your help.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.806
In my dimension,
Shadowhunters
still battle demons.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.776
And now there is
something so much worse.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.278
I need your magic
to help me stop it.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.449
I can't help you.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.219
My magic's gone dormant.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.354
Then wake it up.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.389
[sighs]

18:54.601 --> 18:56.801
Lydia... can we talk?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.905
[sighs] Is this
where you tell me
the engagement's off?

19:00.907 --> 19:01.973
What? No.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.074
Why wouldn't you?

19:03.076 --> 19:05.743
[sighs] Can we just
talk off the record?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.245
Head of Institute hat off?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.513
Yeah.

19:11.251 --> 19:15.586
Listen, I need to come
clean about what happened
at the City of Bones.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.755
Isabelle was there,
wasn't she?

19:17.757 --> 19:21.092
Yeah... and Jace and Clary.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.161
And some vampires
and werewolves.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.831
They thought they
were stopping a war
with the Downworld.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.100
Well, they weren't wrong,
but I had orders.

19:29.102 --> 19:31.602
Yeah, and I understand that
better than anyone.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.205
But I can't let Izzy
be exiled for this.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.441
In the eyes of the
Clave, she's guilty.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.510
I mean, how do you propose
we get around that?

19:41.047 --> 19:43.915
I may have something
that the Clave wants.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.285
I can give them
the Mortal Cup.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.688
Alec, you have it?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.523
Why didn't you tell me before?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.192
[stammers] I promised Jace.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.693
And there's this
thing with Clary--

19:55.695 --> 19:59.130
It's... I get it.
He's your  <i> parabatai.</i>

19:59.132 --> 20:01.299
I'm gonna trade the Cup
for Izzy's freedom.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.567
Do you think the Clave
would go for it?

20:02.569 --> 20:05.670
To keep it out of
Valentine's hands,
they'll do anything.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.737
Where is it?

20:26.859 --> 20:28.092
Jace.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.440
[sighs] This better work.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.912
What does that do?

20:48.114 --> 20:49.447
[grimaces]

20:50.283 --> 20:52.183
Hopefully...

20:52.185 --> 20:53.417
kick-start my magic.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.752
And?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.255
Give it a minute?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.762
That book is very precious.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.532
Warlock spells preserved
in all their grandeur.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.834
[Clary] It's stunning.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.204
This isn't working.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.672
This is the longest
I've ever abstained.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.942
[sighs] From a lot of things.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.710
Why don't you just
try something simple?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.679
Move that.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.683
[sighs]

21:27.086 --> 21:28.152
[grunts]

21:29.989 --> 21:31.155
[scoffs]

21:31.157 --> 21:33.291
Usually, you have a
little bit more of a...

21:34.294 --> 21:35.826
flourish to it.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.461
I do not look like that.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.797
Well...

21:40.266 --> 21:41.532
[sighs]

21:46.739 --> 21:48.172
[grunting]

21:48.975 --> 21:50.775
Magnus, we just have
to find the Portal.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.927
Even if my magic was working,

21:52.928 --> 21:55.078
I'd still need an
energy signature of
some kind to track it.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.814
Maybe we try
something different.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.750
I don't know how this came
into this dimension with me.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.519
Because it's of
this dimension.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.521
It belongs here.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.191
[pulsating]
[gasps]

22:07.193 --> 22:08.993
Oh. Now that's what
I'm talking about.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.294
We have lift off.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.196
[breathes deeply]

22:13.132 --> 22:15.333
The energy is very faint.

22:15.335 --> 22:18.602
It's been dormant
for a long time.
Like me.

22:18.604 --> 22:19.770
[chuckles]

22:19.772 --> 22:21.005
Let's see if we
can wake it up.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.273
[inhales deeply]

22:23.476 --> 22:24.542
Can you see it?

22:25.678 --> 22:29.880
Yes. It's in a
subbasement of...

22:30.516 --> 22:31.615
Fort Knox.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.150
Like, literally Fort--

22:33.152 --> 22:36.454
No, but it might as well be.
The Institute.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.055
Why is that a problem?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.791
High tech, high security.
Impossible to get into.

22:40.793 --> 22:44.028
And hosting an anniversary
party tonight that I have
the hookup to.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.263
[cell phone chimes]

22:47.667 --> 22:48.766
[sighs] Damn.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.803
Meet me tonight at 7:00 p.m.
at the Institute.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.373
Dress to impress.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.381
[Raj] Keep it short.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.086
Jace stole the Cup.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.291
Izzy, did you know about this?

23:15.161 --> 23:16.894
My God, did you help him?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.064
The Cup is the only thing
that can get you out of this.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.732
Jace is doing what
he thinks is right.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.134
What's right?

23:23.770 --> 23:25.603
He put the whole
Shadow World in danger.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.606
He put you in danger.
We have to get him back here.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.208
With the Cup.
It's the only thing
that can help you.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.844
They've taken Meliorn
back to the Seelie realm.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.246
You can't track him there.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.581
Not by any of the normal ways.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.252
No, absolutely not.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.421
You cannot track Jace
through your  <i> parabatai  </i> bond.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.189
It will weaken both of you.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.224
Or break the bond.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.093
Jace already weakened it.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.761
How does he think
I can trust him
after what he did?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.463
Don't say that.
Please, Alec.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.665
Think about what you're doing.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.775
[Fisk groans]

24:04.777 --> 24:06.544
[breathing heavily]

24:10.583 --> 24:11.682
[Simon] Good.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.385
You're awake.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.620
[device powering up]

24:16.622 --> 24:18.389
[breathing heavily]

24:20.726 --> 24:22.993
I would hate to
start this with you...

24:24.130 --> 24:25.396
completely out of it.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.300
A formalin pump?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.402
The perfect little
siphoning tool.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.772
You wanna see how it works?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.440
No.
Don't be shy.

24:36.442 --> 24:39.076
You'll be fine.
It only hurts a little bit.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.344
Until I die.

24:40.346 --> 24:41.645
Yeah.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.481
That is one of
the side effects

24:43.483 --> 24:45.816
of extracting all of the
blood from the human body.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.419
You're the demonic killer.

24:48.421 --> 24:51.188
You know, I don't...
I don't like that title.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.058
It makes me angry.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.827
You wouldn't like
me when I'm angry.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.763
Let's get you hooked
up to this thing.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.099
Please, no.
No. Hey, please.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.167
Please, don't.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.169
[drill whirring]
No, no, no.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.104
Don't! [stammers]
Stop squirming.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.273
[grunting]
You'll just make it
worse for yourself.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.941
No! No!

25:10.943 --> 25:12.009
Help me!

25:12.645 --> 25:13.744
Help me!

25:14.614 --> 25:15.779
[grunting]

25:15.781 --> 25:17.014
Stop.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.249
No! No! No!

25:18.885 --> 25:20.050
Hey.
[grunts]

25:20.052 --> 25:21.151
No! No!

25:21.153 --> 25:23.153
God... No! No!
Stay still.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.355
Somebody help me!

25:24.357 --> 25:25.556
[yells]
[Luke] Stop!

25:25.558 --> 25:27.057
[gun firing]

25:30.496 --> 25:31.862
[panting]

25:36.235 --> 25:37.301
[gun cocking]

25:38.905 --> 25:40.237
I told you it wasn't me.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.605
[panting]

25:44.043 --> 25:45.376
What's the emergency?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.195
Oh, my God.
What happened?

25:48.196 --> 25:50.179
Kickboxing class.
I thought, "Why not?
Quick class after work.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.649
And, boom!
Home in time to see you."

25:51.651 --> 25:53.050
Well, you got the
"boom" part right.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.718
Andrea's foot
right into my face.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.021
She has to pick today
to finally land
her roundhouse?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.989
It's... It's okay.
We'll fix it.
Oh, my God.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.057
What are people gonna think?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.992
And then Alec worked
so hard to plan this.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.827
I just cannot not
go to the party.

26:03.829 --> 26:04.995
And what am I supposed to do?
Hey.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.163
I worked so hard.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.231
Hey, we're gonna fix it.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.432
Okay.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.535
But then we have
to fix you and Jace,

26:11.537 --> 26:14.004
because the two of you
not talking really
messes with my chi.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.840
[breathing heavily]
Are you sure those
are the colors?

26:16.842 --> 26:17.908
We will make it work.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.410
Okay, because if I don't
show up to the party,

26:19.412 --> 26:21.645
your dad and Simon
are so gonna kill me.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.547
So, um...

26:23.549 --> 26:25.082
do you think you
could get a friend of

26:25.084 --> 26:26.517
mine on the guest
list for tonight?

26:26.519 --> 26:30.588
Um... well, if you
make this work, I'll
do anything for you.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.957
[dance music playing]

26:44.036 --> 26:46.604
See, I was obsessed
when I was a kid.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.739
Alice looked into the
mirror and fell into
another dimension.

26:48.741 --> 26:52.042
Well, it must have
stuck with me, because,
when I grew up,

26:52.044 --> 26:54.979
I looked into the
Internet and realized it
needed another dimension.

26:54.981 --> 26:58.282
And our 4D,
breaking-the-speed-barrier
Internet was born.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.117
Says my talented developer.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.287
People said I was mad, so...

27:03.889 --> 27:05.756
I owned it, hmm?

27:05.758 --> 27:07.157
[chuckles]

27:07.159 --> 27:08.792
Thank you so much
for the gig, Mr. M.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.327
Simon, how many times
do I have to tell you?

27:10.329 --> 27:11.428
Sorry... Val.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.496
Poker night. Next
Saturday, all right?

27:12.498 --> 27:13.931
Yes! Is Blackwell
is gonna be there?

27:13.933 --> 27:15.265
'Cause that guy
is a sore loser.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.368
Yeah, that's 'cause
you bled him dry.

27:19.472 --> 27:22.106
If you'll excuse me,
I have some pressing
matters to attend to.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.207
Take care.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.483
I love the hat.
I know you do.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.550
[Jocelyn laughs]

27:46.499 --> 27:47.731
May I?

27:48.134 --> 27:50.367
Jace. Hi. Um...

27:51.837 --> 27:53.003
Clary, what's going
on with you?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.071
Nothing.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.541
[inaudible]

27:59.612 --> 28:00.844
I'll be right back.

28:00.846 --> 28:01.945
Val...

28:06.986 --> 28:08.118
[Valentine] So...

28:08.120 --> 28:10.220
This must be the Jace
I've heard so much about.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.722
Uh, yes, sir. Yeah.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.891
Sir is for my father.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.060
Call me... Mr. Morgenstern.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.296
Okay. Um...
[clears throat]

28:19.298 --> 28:22.900
[stammers] Uh, Dad,
this is, um, our song.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.003
Oh, right.
Nice to meet you.

28:26.005 --> 28:29.239
It was a pleasure to nice...
Uh, nice to meet you as well.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.507
[laughs]

28:30.509 --> 28:31.675
[both chuckle]

28:31.677 --> 28:33.277
[whispers] Damn it.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.279
Uh, Clary...

28:36.148 --> 28:37.848
What...

28:37.850 --> 28:39.249
What's going on with you?

28:39.251 --> 28:40.350
You...
[stammers]

28:40.352 --> 28:42.086
You ran away from
me this morning.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.854
[sighs]
And you...

28:43.856 --> 28:45.689
you didn't respond
to my texts all day,

28:45.691 --> 28:47.091
and now you won't
even dance with me?

28:47.093 --> 28:49.159
I'm sorry, okay?
Really, I am.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.228
I just... [stutters]
I've got a lot on my mind.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.565
Just one dance.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.434
Fine. Okay.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.703
One.
One?

28:59.705 --> 29:01.505
One.
You got somewhere else to be?

29:03.008 --> 29:04.341
[sighs]

29:04.343 --> 29:06.410
[slow music playing]

29:45.951 --> 29:47.017
[phone chimes]

29:48.788 --> 29:50.521
[Alec]  <i> Hodge, you ready?</i>

29:51.056 --> 29:54.324
Alec, don't do this
out of anger. Jace is
still your  <i> parabatai.</i>

29:54.326 --> 29:55.559
Lydia's right.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.427
I'm not letting Jace
sacrifice my sister

29:57.429 --> 29:59.196
for his girlfriend's
pointless crusade.

29:59.732 --> 30:00.798
We're doing this.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.299
And if you don't
want to help, get out.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.835
I'll help...
but on one condition.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.003
What?

30:06.005 --> 30:07.571
You don't let it go too far.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.607
Now your bond with Jace
can withstand a certain
amount of strain.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.844
But you have to promise me
that you won't let it break.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.245
Jace is dead to me.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.281
Alec?
[Lydia] You don't know

30:17.283 --> 30:18.615
how dependent you
are on the bond,

30:18.617 --> 30:19.917
or how dependent
you are on each other.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.285
I have to do this.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.820
For Izzy.

30:24.924 --> 30:25.989
[scoffs]

30:28.494 --> 30:29.860
[breathes deeply]

30:30.162 --> 30:31.395
Prepare yourself.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.064
This will be very,
very painful.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.166
Do it.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.435
[indistinct rustling]

30:38.437 --> 30:39.503
Do you hear that?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.839
[demon growls]

30:41.841 --> 30:42.906
[Jace grunting]

30:45.177 --> 30:46.443
Where the hell
did you get those?

30:46.445 --> 30:47.845
The Earth provides,
Shadowhunter.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.279
Don't just stand there!
[demon growls]

30:49.281 --> 30:50.781
[Alec wincing]

30:50.783 --> 30:52.182
[groaning]

30:55.654 --> 30:57.020
[breathing heavily]

31:05.664 --> 31:06.930
Concentrate.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.601
Reach out with your mind...
and your heart.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.238
Use every strand,

31:14.240 --> 31:17.040
every fiber of you that
is connected to him.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.876
[gasps] It's working.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.714
I can see him.
[grunts]

31:24.216 --> 31:26.216
[both groaning]

31:26.218 --> 31:27.351
Jace!

31:27.353 --> 31:28.485
[groans]

31:31.023 --> 31:33.156
[grunts] Alec!

31:33.158 --> 31:34.291
You know where he is?

31:35.561 --> 31:36.927
[groaning]

31:38.397 --> 31:40.597
[both screaming]

31:42.835 --> 31:44.134
[Magnus] Check it again.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.837
I told you, I'm on the list.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.138
You're not here.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.707
What seems to be the problem?

31:50.709 --> 31:51.909
This one wants to
crash the party.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.779
I'll be responsible
for this one.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.581
Come on in.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.457
To us.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.296
[Alec] And you are?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.631
[Magnus] Magnus Bane.
[Alec] Alec Lightwood.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.633
Thanks, but...

32:17.469 --> 32:18.669
I gotta go.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.206
Playing hard to get.
I love a challenge.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.077
[clears throat]

32:27.079 --> 32:28.812
I need to borrow your lady.
Okay.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.214
Well, promise you'll
give her back to me?

32:31.951 --> 32:33.250
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.519
Well, I'll have to trust you.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.354
All right.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.724
I'm gonna ask Izzy
to move in with me.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.592
Oh, my God, Simon.
She's totally gonna say yes.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.727
You think so?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.095
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe it's a bad idea.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.097
[stammers]
Like a really bad idea.
It could be a bad idea.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.633
Simon...
[imitates Dracula]
look into my eyes.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.768
The Dracula stare.
Mmm-hmm.

32:51.770 --> 32:52.903
Well played.

32:52.905 --> 32:53.971
[both chuckling]

32:53.973 --> 32:56.139
Okay, I'm good. I'm good.
All right.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.141
Go get 'em, tiger.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.242
Okay.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.911
[chuckles]

33:00.913 --> 33:02.813
[dance music playing]

33:07.753 --> 33:08.986
Come on, let's go.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.555
Who are you?

33:15.928 --> 33:18.095
Clary, it's me, Magnus.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.830
[echoing] Do I know you?

33:19.832 --> 33:21.498
Focus.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.100
Okay, seriously, let go of me.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.234
[cat meowing]

33:26.038 --> 33:27.170
What is wrong with you?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.241
Dude, I... [sighs]

33:34.446 --> 33:35.712
[exclaims]

33:35.714 --> 33:38.048
[sighs] That was close.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.017
You're telling me.
This way. Let's go.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.636
[sighing heavily]
Is that him?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.038
Yeah, they're
running the prints now.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.340
Thanks for...

34:03.342 --> 34:04.508
Just doing my job.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.109
About that.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.578
IA is off your back.
For good.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.547
Hell, the mayor wants
to give you a medal.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.316
[chuckles] I'll just
take some time off.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.152
Okay.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.319
Thanks.

34:17.890 --> 34:18.955
[Alaric] Detective.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.596
[sighs]

34:26.598 --> 34:28.231
So... how'd I do?

34:28.834 --> 34:30.167
Hmm.
What?

34:30.169 --> 34:31.601
You shot me, like,
a gazillion times.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.070
Shouldn't have had to.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.672
What's that?
Alaric's working his magic

34:35.674 --> 34:37.607
so you're not associated
with the demonic murders.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.744
You saved our Alpha.
The pack's indebted to you.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.513
So, I'm thinking...
moo shu pork for life?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.088
What are we even looking for?

34:51.924 --> 34:53.356
I'll know it when I see it.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.862
What if this doesn't work?

34:58.864 --> 35:01.264
It will, biscuit.
I can feel it.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.700
[gasps]

35:06.738 --> 35:08.538
You know, if you were having
second thoughts about us,

35:08.540 --> 35:10.240
you could have told me,
instead of coming down here

35:10.242 --> 35:11.541
and hooking up with
some random guy.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.543
Jace, this isn't
exactly a good time.
Really?

35:13.545 --> 35:15.112
You know when would be a
good time for me, Clary?

35:16.381 --> 35:17.881
Never.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.116
Never call me again.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.719
[demon growls]
[gasps]

35:22.721 --> 35:23.820
[Clary grunts]

35:23.822 --> 35:24.888
What the hell
is that thing?

35:24.890 --> 35:26.289
Let's go.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.398
[gasping]

35:37.336 --> 35:38.468
Did you kill it?

35:39.071 --> 35:40.203
No.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.540
It went through?

35:46.678 --> 35:47.744
[low rumbling]

35:50.149 --> 35:52.082
I have to shut the entrance.

35:52.084 --> 35:53.416
More demons are coming.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.518
What about Clary?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.353
You said you Seelies
protect other dimensions.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.138
We do.

35:58.139 --> 35:59.922
There is a demon in
there with a bunch of
unprotected people.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.459
Let me in.
[sighs]

36:02.461 --> 36:04.461
I can kill it.
If I seal the
doorway behind you--

36:04.463 --> 36:06.830
I know, the Portal
is the only way out.

36:07.466 --> 36:10.333
I'm willing to take that
risk. Grant me entry.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.604
Remember, you won't have
your seraph blade.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.607
Demons don't disintegrate
in this dimension.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.342
[speaking Seelie]

36:21.280 --> 36:21.978
Go.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.017
[Jace trembling]

36:27.019 --> 36:28.518
[softly] It's okay. It's okay.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.055
[Clary shushing]

36:32.057 --> 36:33.790
[energy pulsating]

36:42.401 --> 36:43.533
Jace?

36:43.535 --> 36:44.801
Yeah.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.703
[sighs]
You okay?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.205
[exhales] Thank God, it's you.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.141
[Alec] Jace! Jace!

36:51.143 --> 36:53.410
[panting] No. No.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.711
What was that?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.580
I don't know.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.616
But if they're in there,
they're not coming out.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.919
Mind filling me in?

37:02.921 --> 37:04.187
[Clary stammers]

37:04.189 --> 37:05.655
[demon growls]
Jace!

37:05.657 --> 37:06.756
[both grunting]

37:10.495 --> 37:11.595
[Clary grunting]

37:24.009 --> 37:25.575
[demon groaning]

37:26.011 --> 37:27.043
[Jace grunts]
[yelps]

37:27.045 --> 37:29.079
[demon groans]
[Clary grunts]

37:30.015 --> 37:32.015
[Jace groans]
Jace?

37:33.185 --> 37:34.618
Jace. Oh, my God!

37:34.620 --> 37:37.087
Jace, it's okay,
it's okay. Breathe.

37:37.089 --> 37:39.089
[gasping]
Jace?

37:43.128 --> 37:44.294
[Clary panting]

37:44.296 --> 37:45.462
[Jace gasping]

37:48.767 --> 37:49.933
Where's my stele?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.368
It didn't come
through with you.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.402
[Jace gasps]

37:52.404 --> 37:54.204
You're gonna need more
than a stele for that.

37:54.206 --> 37:55.872
Will Portaling him back
to his own body cure him?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.375
No. Blood travels with you.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.543
It's why your angelic
powers still work here.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.462
The demon venom
is in his blood.

38:02.463 --> 38:04.380
Then we have to get him
back to the Institute
in our dimension.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.783
[grunts] No, we've
gotta find Valentine.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.951
[breathing raggedly]

38:07.953 --> 38:10.253
Jace, you're in no
condition to fight.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.554
We might not get
another chance, Clary.
This is too important.

38:12.557 --> 38:13.723
[Magnus] I found it!

38:13.725 --> 38:14.991
Come on.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.160
[groans]

38:19.898 --> 38:20.997
Magnus.

38:35.247 --> 38:36.913
[breathing heavily]
You'll have to destroy

38:36.915 --> 38:38.415
the Portal
after we go through.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.482
Why?

38:39.484 --> 38:42.085
To secure your
dimension from all sides.

38:42.087 --> 38:45.088
Otherwise, if it stays open,

38:45.090 --> 38:47.590
you'll be vulnerable
to demon attacks again.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.092
I'll take care of it...

38:49.094 --> 38:51.328
and the malodorous
monstrosity on that table.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.198
Thank you.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.599
Well, I should
be thanking you.

38:56.601 --> 39:00.837
No... you gave me back
a life. I won't forget it.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.806
Now, go.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.507
[panting]

39:04.509 --> 39:05.842
Think of your father.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.125
[Raj] Hey. Hey, Alec!
[Alec] Just... Just wait.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.728
What happened?

39:24.730 --> 39:25.862
Are you and Jace okay?

39:25.864 --> 39:26.963
No.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.800
Our  <i> parabatai  </i> bond,
it's just...

39:31.737 --> 39:32.969
so weak.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.205
He's like a ghost.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.607
Alec, what did you do?

39:39.511 --> 39:41.378
Lydia and I thought
we could stop the trial

39:41.380 --> 39:42.846
if we gave the
Cup to the Clave.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.080
Lydia helped you?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.049
It doesn't matter.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.387
[sighs]

39:53.325 --> 39:55.759
She has no choice
but to go through
with the trial now.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.003
[Isabelle sighs]

40:07.005 --> 40:10.573
It's okay, big brother.
I know you tried.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.075
[Alec sighs]

40:15.514 --> 40:16.746
I'm sorry.

40:20.185 --> 40:21.818
[Isabelle sighs]

40:23.922 --> 40:25.789
[Jace groaning]

40:27.359 --> 40:28.525
Jace.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.893
Okay.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.361
[groaning continues]

40:32.297 --> 40:34.764
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here, it's okay.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.299
No going back now.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.268
[grunts]

40:46.478 --> 40:48.845
Magnus was right.
It's not working.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.014
It's enough.

40:52.284 --> 40:53.616
[Jace grunts]

41:07.833 --> 41:09.299
What is all this?

41:13.138 --> 41:14.637
The makings of an army.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.308
There's no one here.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.243
Did Meliorn lie to us?

41:20.245 --> 41:22.579
He said that that Portal
would take us to my father.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.314
[banging on door]
[both gasp]

41:27.419 --> 41:29.185
[whispering]
Get behind me.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.420
[banging continues]

41:48.607 --> 41:50.206
It can't be.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.009
It can't be.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.211
You died.
I saw it.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.750
Jace?

42:02.454 --> 42:05.722
[softly] Jace...
is it really you?

42:05.724 --> 42:07.524
Jace, how do you
know this man?

42:10.629 --> 42:12.128
He's my father.
