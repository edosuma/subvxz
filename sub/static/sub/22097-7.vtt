00:02.829 --> 00:05.354
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:37.163 --> 00:38.755
Ignoring me
won't help.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.892
No, I've decided you're an
expression of my subconscious mind...

00:41.968 --> 00:44.664
playing itself out
in my waking states.

00:45.105 --> 00:47.437
So, I'm only
in your head?

00:47.507 --> 00:50.874
Of course if you're not
really here, neither am I.

00:50.944 --> 00:54.675
Do you have any idea what they
would do to me if they find out?

00:54.748 --> 00:56.716
They'd probably
charge you with treason.

00:56.783 --> 00:58.910
Treason is punishable
by the death penalty.

00:59.886 --> 01:01.444
Come on, Sharon.
Where are you?

01:01.721 --> 01:03.586
Where are you, Sharon?

01:07.594 --> 01:08.788
Helo!

01:08.862 --> 01:10.853
We gotta go. Right now.

01:23.443 --> 01:26.003
I don't see
the hand of God in here.

01:28.081 --> 01:30.049
Could I be looking
in the wrong place?

01:32.352 --> 01:36.516
Let me see. Proteins? Yes.
Hemoglobin? Yes.

01:37.023 --> 01:38.513
Divine digits?

01:40.894 --> 01:42.020
No.

01:42.095 --> 01:45.292
Sorry. I'm sure
I can find evidence...

01:45.365 --> 01:48.766
of his divine hand in some of
these delightful little samples.

01:49.970 --> 01:53.235
After all,
there are so fracking many...

01:53.306 --> 01:56.673
I'm sure even I can be relied
upon to find God in one of them.

01:56.743 --> 01:59.803
What is it that drives
you to blasphemy, Gaius?

01:59.980 --> 02:02.778
A need to tempt fate?
Boredom, actually.

02:03.516 --> 02:05.950
Indeed, every
waking hour is spent...

02:06.019 --> 02:09.147
in what some might say, has
become my own personal religion.

02:09.222 --> 02:12.123
The Church
of the Mystic Cylon Detector.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.184
Well...

02:17.998 --> 02:19.488
are you finished?

02:22.469 --> 02:25.165
If you would give yourself
over to God's will...

02:25.271 --> 02:27.967
you'd find peace
in his love like I have.

02:29.342 --> 02:30.775
Could you help me
with this zipper?

02:30.844 --> 02:32.709
I'm having
a bit of trouble.

02:33.313 --> 02:36.612
He has a plan for us.
How do you know it's a he?

02:38.151 --> 02:40.813
There is only
one true God.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.850
Really?

02:44.224 --> 02:47.625
You running a glitch
in the program or something?

02:47.694 --> 02:50.322
'Cause you say the same thing
over and over again.

02:50.397 --> 02:53.230
Now, I've accepted
your God and all that.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.932
Can't we reboot
the hard drive?

02:56.436 --> 02:58.529
He's not my God.
He is God.

03:00.273 --> 03:02.867
Yeah, your God,
my God, everyone's God.

03:02.942 --> 03:06.503
He's big enough for all of us,
isn't he? Now, please.

03:06.579 --> 03:08.308
Please, honey.

03:08.915 --> 03:13.045
Can't we do something
a little more elevating?

03:13.153 --> 03:16.748
It's important you form a
personal relationship with God.

03:17.257 --> 03:20.624
Only you can give yourself
over to his eternal love.

03:21.127 --> 03:22.685
For God's sake!

03:24.764 --> 03:26.356
I can't take this anymore!

03:26.433 --> 03:28.799
I'm trying to save
your immortal soul.

03:28.868 --> 03:33.498
What you are doing, darling, is boring me
to death with your superstitious drivel.

03:33.573 --> 03:35.905
Your metaphysical
nonsense...

03:36.209 --> 03:39.372
which, to be fair, actually appeals
to the half-educated dullards...

03:39.446 --> 03:42.677
that make up most of human society,
but which, I hasten to add...

03:42.749 --> 03:47.277
no rational, intelligent, free-thinking
human being truly believes.

03:48.788 --> 03:51.848
Which leads me to the
inescapable conclusion...

03:51.925 --> 03:54.359
that Cylons are,
in the final...

03:58.531 --> 04:02.865
That Cylons are, in the final
analysis, little more than toasters...

04:06.840 --> 04:08.808
with great-looking legs.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.674
It's my fantasy.
See if I care.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.180
I'll dream up
someone new maybe...

04:22.255 --> 04:23.813
a brunette maybe.

04:29.262 --> 04:32.288
Maybe we can dispense with the
foreplay. Get right down to...

04:32.365 --> 04:34.026
What did you say?

04:35.869 --> 04:40.465
That was nothing. I was
just talking to myself.

04:41.808 --> 04:43.469
I talk to myself.

04:44.878 --> 04:45.845
Hang me.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.878
The Commander would like
to see you in the CIC, Doctor.

04:56.489 --> 04:59.151
There you are.
Very nice.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.758
That blouse could open up
a button or two. Excuse me?

05:02.829 --> 05:04.729
You wanted to see me,
Commander?

05:04.797 --> 05:06.196
Miss Godfrey has brought...

05:06.266 --> 05:09.429
some very disturbing
accusations to my attention.

05:09.669 --> 05:13.435
I think you should have the
chance to answer them in person.

05:14.674 --> 05:16.335
Right. Thank you.

05:18.278 --> 05:21.076
And she is?
She's standing right there.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.413
I'm right here.
Yeah, of course you are.

05:26.653 --> 05:28.587
Doctor, this is
Miss Godfrey.

05:35.295 --> 05:38.696
All of you can see her?
You can all see her!

05:38.765 --> 05:41.199
She's standing
right next to you.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.534
Something wrong?
No.

05:49.275 --> 05:52.904
Don't make me angry, Gaius. I'd
say you have a serious problem.

05:53.479 --> 05:54.707
Get down.

05:57.550 --> 06:00.041
Yes, maybe I...

06:02.522 --> 06:05.013
You'll have to forgive me,
Miss Godfrey.

06:05.091 --> 06:09.152
I'm very pleased, if slightly
puzzled, to make your acquaintance.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.356
Don't touch me,
you traitor.

06:13.533 --> 06:16.297
Is she talking to me?
You talking to me?

06:16.502 --> 06:20.029
You're the one who let the
Cylons into the defense mainframe.

06:20.106 --> 06:22.370
You betrayed
your entire race.

06:22.575 --> 06:24.543
You're the man responsible
for the Holocaust...

06:24.611 --> 06:26.340
and I'm here to see
that you're exposed...

06:26.412 --> 06:29.711
and sentenced to death
as the traitor you really are.

07:48.426 --> 07:53.159
Doctor, Miss Godfrey has made
some startling accusations.

07:57.035 --> 07:59.595
I've never seen this woman
before in my life.

07:59.871 --> 08:01.532
I'm not surprised
you don't remember me.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.769
I was just a lowly systems
analyst at the Defense Ministry.

08:04.843 --> 08:07.141
Dr. Amarak
was my associate.

08:07.579 --> 08:10.047
She says you sold out the human race.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.674
That you let the Cylons
into our defense plans.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.652
Dr. Amarak told me
he had evidence...

08:17.722 --> 08:19.917
that Dr. Baltar was
involved in the sneak attack.

08:19.991 --> 08:22.653
He was trying to reach the President
and give her that information...

08:22.727 --> 08:23.751
when he was killed.

08:23.828 --> 08:25.887
He told you that, did he?
Yes, as a matter of fact.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.295
It's a pity he's no longer with us.

08:27.365 --> 08:30.357
How convenient that we only
have your word for that.

08:30.435 --> 08:33.666
There's also this.
Yeah, what the frack's that?

08:36.608 --> 08:38.633
He gave me this for safekeeping.

08:39.444 --> 08:41.105
It's ID coded.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.048
Colonial
Defense Ministry.

08:48.586 --> 08:51.020
Dr. Amarak gave the disk
to me before he died.

08:51.089 --> 08:53.853
What, as opposed to
after he died?

08:53.925 --> 08:56.826
Amarak gave the
disk to me for safekeeping.

08:57.228 --> 08:58.820
On the disk is a photo.

08:58.897 --> 09:00.728
It was captured from
the security camera...

09:00.798 --> 09:02.425
in the defense mainframe
on Caprica.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.525
It shows the doctor
entering the mainframe...

09:04.602 --> 09:07.571
without permission
the day before the attack.

09:12.644 --> 09:14.544
Nothing criminal about that.

09:14.946 --> 09:18.677
As you can see, the man in the photo
is carrying an explosive device.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.382
Sorry, he's what?

09:20.451 --> 09:21.440
He's...

09:23.888 --> 09:25.355
I definitely
never did that.

09:25.423 --> 09:28.324
Just before the Cylon attack,
the entire defense mainframe...

09:28.393 --> 09:30.623
was destroyed by this device.

09:31.162 --> 09:34.996
Honestly, that is not me. I
wasn't there. It's somebody else.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.793
Look, it's not me. I'm not
the man in the photograph.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.569
I see a man.
Same height, same build...

09:41.639 --> 09:44.005
but that's a long way
from proof, Miss Godfrey.

09:44.075 --> 09:47.374
Thank you, Commander. Now, if we're
quite done with this charade, I'm...

09:47.445 --> 09:49.572
I agree, Commander,
but look here.

09:49.981 --> 09:52.040
In the faceplate of
the computer terminal...

09:52.116 --> 09:53.913
there's a reflection
of the man's face.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.720
You can't tell
anything from that.

09:59.791 --> 10:00.883
Thank you, Colonel.

10:00.959 --> 10:04.360
With the right equipment, the image
could be enlarged and sharpened.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.329
We could see
his face.

10:07.198 --> 10:10.326
Enlarging the image is no
problem, but sharpening it...

10:10.401 --> 10:11.732
Take forever.

10:11.803 --> 10:13.430
It'd take
at least a day, sir.

10:14.038 --> 10:16.871
Mr. Gaeta, let me know
as soon as you have an image.

10:16.941 --> 10:17.999
Sir.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.239
I'm going to suspend all work
on the Cylon detector...

10:21.312 --> 10:22.176
What?

10:22.246 --> 10:24.737
...as well as
your security privileges.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.948
<i>Starbuck's notes on
the Cylon Raider are a mess.</i>

10:32.490 --> 10:36.449
She said "the engine power-up sequence
began by squeezing something...

10:36.527 --> 10:41.089
"that looks like a red ligament
with blue veins on the right side...

10:41.165 --> 10:45.261
"coming out of
a sack of gooey fluid...

10:45.336 --> 10:47.167
"shaped like a dog. "

10:47.238 --> 10:48.762
Are you kidding me?

10:49.640 --> 10:54.543
This whole thing is a bunch of
veins and ligaments and sacks of goo.

10:55.013 --> 10:57.038
"Squeeze the
ligament with your hand...

10:57.115 --> 10:58.980
"while you slide
your weight...

10:59.050 --> 11:03.384
"on your left hip
into the lymphatic sack. "

11:03.454 --> 11:05.217
That's just stupid.

11:06.991 --> 11:09.152
Afternoon, sir.
Specialist.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.460
Chief's inside?
Yeah.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.189
Chief.

11:14.265 --> 11:15.698
God! Yes, sir?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.295
How's it
coming in there?

11:18.369 --> 11:21.395
I'm getting there, sir.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.964
I haven't quite figured out all
the tricks, but I'm getting there.

11:29.013 --> 11:31.174
Come on,
Starbuck, you can do it.

11:33.418 --> 11:34.942
That smarts.

11:37.288 --> 11:41.725
That smarts,
but I don't care.

11:41.793 --> 11:42.885
You don't care.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.724
I don't care, because your
pain is my entertainment.

11:45.797 --> 11:49.028
Your crutches of death, sir.
Use them wisely.

11:49.133 --> 11:50.395
Shut up.

11:50.468 --> 11:53.096
It's gonna hurt like hell,
but it's supposed to.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.570
Thanks, Doc.

11:55.273 --> 11:56.934
No pain,
no gain.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.837
No clichŽ
left unturned...

12:00.912 --> 12:03.904
as Kara Thrace returns to
the world of the walking.

12:03.981 --> 12:06.814
Can she do it or will
she fall on her ass?

12:07.118 --> 12:10.087
I swear to the Gods, I'm gonna
beat the crap out of both of you...

12:10.154 --> 12:11.746
as soon as
I get better.

12:12.824 --> 12:14.052
No, I can't.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.592
Yes, you can. You did it.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.321
I can't.

12:18.763 --> 12:21.061
You're not gonna get better
lying on your back.

12:21.132 --> 12:22.497
Frack off!

12:22.567 --> 12:24.831
Just take a break for five
minutes, we'll try again.

12:24.902 --> 12:27.996
I don't want to do it again.
I want a pill, now, please.

12:28.072 --> 12:31.803
Sorry, we're weaning you off
the magic pills starting today.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.276
And, besides,
I need them for myself.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.804
You son of a bitch.

12:38.382 --> 12:42.341
<i>I am finding this whole
thing hard to fathom, Doctor.</i>

12:42.420 --> 12:44.285
Thank you, Madam President.

12:46.257 --> 12:49.192
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.530
Look, I was wondering,
is there any chance...

12:55.133 --> 12:59.229
<i>that while this investigation is going on,
I could come back to the Colonial One...</i>

12:59.303 --> 13:02.295
because I've left
some of my things there.

13:02.373 --> 13:03.840
No, I'm sorry, Doctor.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.907
You have been put on
a "no fly" list. Security.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.775
<i>Madam President,
I need to get off Galactica.</i>

13:14.852 --> 13:17.844
I need to get away from this
Shelly Godfrey woman in particular.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.856
She's got it in for me.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.659
Where are you?

13:28.299 --> 13:31.962
Madam President,
I have reason to believe...

13:39.010 --> 13:43.071
that she may be a Cylon.

13:48.819 --> 13:51.885
Madam President?

13:52.623 --> 13:54.215
<i>Hello?</i>

13:54.292 --> 13:57.921
Get on the wireless. Get Doc Cottle over
here now. The President has collapsed.

14:00.031 --> 14:01.225
Hello?

14:04.701 --> 14:05.497
Is she alive?

14:05.569 --> 14:06.968
Yes, the President is alive.

14:07.404 --> 14:09.770
I told you, she's conscious,
she's resting.

14:11.107 --> 14:13.575
She's receiving treatment.
What kind of treatment?

14:13.643 --> 14:14.974
Asked and answered.

14:15.045 --> 14:18.310
We think it's a stomach flu.
What kind of treatment?

14:18.715 --> 14:21.411
How many of these
did you take, young lady?

14:22.686 --> 14:23.744
One?

14:24.821 --> 14:27.119
Two?
Two.

14:31.194 --> 14:34.630
Three.
Three times the dosage.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.998
Must work three times
as fast then, right?

14:38.401 --> 14:43.100
Everybody wants to be their own doctor,
you are lucky you didn't lapse into a coma.

14:43.506 --> 14:46.304
You can't cure cancer
by overdose.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.439
Story's all over the fleet.
I'm so sorry.

14:51.514 --> 14:52.606
It's okay.

14:52.682 --> 14:53.910
It seemed like
an emergency.

14:53.984 --> 14:56.612
I didn't think that anyone might
be picking up the transmission.

14:56.686 --> 14:59.120
We're all new at this.
It's okay.

15:00.090 --> 15:03.184
The thing to do now
is to get me on my feet...

15:03.260 --> 15:06.752
and in front of the press
before the end of the day.

15:06.830 --> 15:10.823
I could give you a shot, but you
wouldn't like the side effects.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.198
Just do it.

15:15.505 --> 15:16.494
You know...

15:17.974 --> 15:22.809
the time is going to come when you are
not able to hide what you're going through.

15:26.683 --> 15:28.913
It's not that kind of a shot.

15:31.655 --> 15:33.122
Thank you.

15:36.426 --> 15:39.987
Baltar's correct about
the convenience of it all.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.457
Amarak just happens
to bring you...

15:43.533 --> 15:45.865
the key piece of evidence
just before he dies.

15:45.935 --> 15:49.962
Something was going on.
He was almost paranoid.

15:50.040 --> 15:54.443
<i>Kept saying that the Olympic Carrier
had been infiltrated by the Cylons.</i>

15:55.578 --> 15:59.105
He wanted me to take some things
off the ship for safekeeping.

15:59.182 --> 16:00.843
Why'd he give it to you?

16:03.486 --> 16:05.078
We were friends.

16:06.523 --> 16:07.785
Friends?

16:10.894 --> 16:13.454
I loved him.
I loved him very much.

16:22.572 --> 16:26.668
There are times
when I just feel so alone now.

16:28.578 --> 16:31.672
Times when I just want so much
to be held again.

16:34.484 --> 16:36.782
You understand that,
don't you?

16:37.821 --> 16:39.789
Of course.

16:40.857 --> 16:44.657
There must be times
when you feel alone.

16:46.730 --> 16:49.824
And the thought of another
body next to yours...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.834
seems like
something out of dream.

17:07.050 --> 17:09.450
Do not,
under any circumstances...

17:09.519 --> 17:12.511
allow Shelly Godfrey
to leave this ship.

17:12.889 --> 17:15.585
<i>Put her under
surveillance, discreetly.</i>

17:16.159 --> 17:19.492
I want to know everybody she's
talked to, and everywhere she's been.

17:34.811 --> 17:37.712
Come on, Sharon! Get up.

18:46.449 --> 18:47.541
Excuse me.

19:08.071 --> 19:11.404
Lieutenant? Is that you?

19:14.410 --> 19:15.570
Doctor?

19:15.645 --> 19:17.613
Isn't this a coincidence.

19:21.084 --> 19:24.451
So, how are you doing?

19:25.588 --> 19:26.714
I'm...

19:26.789 --> 19:28.086
You're busy.
Yes, I know.

19:28.157 --> 19:31.820
I don't mean to distract you.
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

19:42.939 --> 19:45.169
You still there?
Yup.

19:46.142 --> 19:48.610
I know this is
an awkward time.

19:48.945 --> 19:51.072
But it occurs to me
I haven't told you...

19:51.147 --> 19:55.083
how invaluable your assistance has
been to me over the past few weeks.

19:56.319 --> 20:00.050
Thank you, Doctor. You have no
idea how much that means to me.

20:00.123 --> 20:01.988
Not at all.

20:04.527 --> 20:06.791
So how's it going
over there?

20:08.698 --> 20:11.223
In the lab, that is. I'm
talking about the photograph.

20:11.301 --> 20:14.702
Right.
It's coming along...

20:14.938 --> 20:18.374
quite quickly, actually.
A few more hours to go.

20:20.577 --> 20:23.637
Has it ever occurred to you
that the photograph...

20:24.180 --> 20:26.546
the disk itself
could be a fake?

20:27.483 --> 20:29.041
I've already
authenticated the disk.

20:29.118 --> 20:32.713
Obviously, you're quite good. But
there are many ways around security.

20:32.789 --> 20:35.656
If I could join you in the lab for
just two minutes of your time...

20:35.725 --> 20:36.987
I could show you.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.857
I really don't think
that's possible.

20:38.928 --> 20:43.228
Listen to me, nobody would need to
know. It would just be you and me.

20:43.499 --> 20:44.625
I know.

20:44.701 --> 20:48.762
For God's sake, my life is on the
line. My reputation is at stake.

20:48.838 --> 20:50.203
So is mine, Doctor.
I really...

20:50.273 --> 20:52.867
Someone's coming.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.784
Wait, Gaeta! You forgot
to wash your hands!

21:22.605 --> 21:23.697
What the hell...

21:23.773 --> 21:25.331
I want answers,
and I want them now!

21:25.408 --> 21:28.343
I'm not interested in playing
any more of your stupid games!

21:28.411 --> 21:30.971
Have you lost your mind? That's
an interesting question...

21:31.047 --> 21:33.140
one I pose to myself
on a regular basis.

21:33.216 --> 21:35.343
Now tell me. Who's
really in the photograph?

21:35.418 --> 21:36.510
You are!

21:37.587 --> 21:41.683
I didn't plant any bomb, anywhere,
at any time, and you know that.

21:41.991 --> 21:46.018
I don't know anything of this
sort. Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:52.101 --> 21:55.764
All right. Let's entertain the
notion, just for a moment...

21:56.673 --> 21:59.540
that you are not the woman
that I see everywhere.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.601
You are not Shelly Godfrey,
either.

22:05.114 --> 22:08.481
You're a fake.
You're just a copy.

22:10.753 --> 22:12.721
Another Cylon copy.

22:14.891 --> 22:17.121
Get out.

22:19.796 --> 22:23.493
Struck a nerve, have I? Which I
find rather impossible to believe!

22:23.566 --> 22:26.501
You think this is over?
This is not over!

22:26.569 --> 22:29.902
You have not heard the last.
No more Mr. Nice Gaius!

22:36.379 --> 22:37.641
Women.

22:51.226 --> 22:53.786
Stupid. Unbelievable.

22:55.497 --> 22:56.794
Frack it!

22:59.367 --> 23:00.994
Not a good time?

23:04.205 --> 23:05.866
No, it's fine.

23:07.676 --> 23:09.610
Guess you're having problems?

23:10.912 --> 23:13.472
I just can't get
this thing to work.

23:14.149 --> 23:18.745
I've been over it and over it,
and nothing.

23:24.059 --> 23:28.189
I have no idea how Starbuck
got this thing to move.

23:28.763 --> 23:30.560
Much less fly.

23:30.632 --> 23:32.463
It's not really a thing,
you know.

23:35.737 --> 23:37.967
It's probably
a Cylon itself.

23:43.478 --> 23:46.413
More of an animal maybe,
than the human models.

23:50.251 --> 23:53.618
Maybe they genetically
design it to perform a task.

23:54.489 --> 23:55.979
To be a fighter.

23:59.094 --> 24:02.325
Can't treat it like a thing
and expect it to respond.

24:02.864 --> 24:05.492
You have to treat it
like a pet.

24:10.372 --> 24:12.772
At least that's my guess.

24:13.742 --> 24:15.334
Your guess?

24:15.944 --> 24:17.969
Yeah, that's right.
My guess.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.347
Something else
you want to say?

24:21.483 --> 24:23.246
No.

24:34.095 --> 24:37.826
Lieutenant. I heard you were
supposed to be up on your feet by now.

24:38.266 --> 24:39.563
You heard wrong.

24:39.634 --> 24:42.569
I figured you
wouldn't bounce back so fast.

24:43.038 --> 24:46.872
Is there something you wanted, or did
you just drop by to torment me, sir?

24:46.941 --> 24:49.876
Yeah. The Chief wanted me
to kick your ass out of bed...

24:49.944 --> 24:52.879
<i>so you could help figure
out that Raider of yours.</i>

24:52.947 --> 24:55.211
But, clearly,
you still need the rest.

24:55.283 --> 24:56.807
Take your time.
No rush.

24:57.652 --> 25:01.679
Do you actually think that reverse
psychology crap is going to work on me?

25:01.790 --> 25:04.350
I really don't care
what you think, Lieutenant.

25:04.426 --> 25:06.860
All I know is that every day
you spend in that bed...

25:06.928 --> 25:11.092
is another day that I have my
opinion of you confirmed. As you were.

25:15.937 --> 25:19.464
And I am convinced, in fact,
that she is a Cylon agent.

25:21.376 --> 25:25.836
In my opinion, she should be locked
up before she can do any more damage.

25:30.885 --> 25:32.409
Where are you?

25:34.689 --> 25:36.748
You're having
a little fun, eh?

25:42.664 --> 25:44.393
Do you enjoy messing around
with my life?

25:44.466 --> 25:47.629
Do you have any
evidence to support this charge?

25:48.903 --> 25:50.894
Work on the Cylon detector
is nearly complete.

25:50.972 --> 25:53.998
With a few tweaks here and there,
I'll have a test regime up and running.

25:54.075 --> 25:57.806
All I need is a tissue sample
from this woman for analysis.

25:57.879 --> 25:59.972
I thought we had something.

26:03.218 --> 26:06.244
Something special.

26:06.554 --> 26:09.421
I can't allow you
access to your equipment.

26:11.359 --> 26:12.690
All right.

26:13.828 --> 26:17.855
But under instruction, I can surely
tell Gaeta how to prepare the samples.

26:18.399 --> 26:19.730
It's not difficult.

26:19.801 --> 26:22.269
Let me be frank with you,
Doctor.

26:23.505 --> 26:26.303
If your picture is
on that photograph...

26:26.374 --> 26:31.277
every piece of equipment in your laboratory
will be dismantled and quarantined.

26:31.746 --> 26:36.615
And every person that you have met
will be questioned and investigated.

26:38.486 --> 26:41.580
<i>I love you.
There, I've said it.</i>

26:42.790 --> 26:45.350
Isn't that what
you've been dying to hear?

26:45.426 --> 26:49.157
I am willing to make that
commitment to you right now.

26:49.230 --> 26:51.357
The President believes
I'm innocent.

26:51.432 --> 26:55.630
The President hopes you're
innocent. And so do I.

26:56.838 --> 27:00.604
Because if you're not, then
you've made fools of both of us.

27:01.976 --> 27:03.967
And I don't like
to be made a fool of.

27:04.045 --> 27:06.912
And I don't like to be accused
of participating...

27:06.981 --> 27:09.677
in the genocide of the human
race based solely on the word...

27:09.751 --> 27:14.279
of a woman whom I have already indicated
to you may well be a Cylon agent.

27:15.557 --> 27:18.993
I'm willing to do anything.
Anything at all.

27:20.295 --> 27:21.557
I need your help.

27:21.629 --> 27:24.257
I did not conspire
with the Cylons.

27:24.332 --> 27:26.027
I am an innocent man...

27:26.100 --> 27:30.298
who is being convicted in the court
of public opinion without trial.

27:40.381 --> 27:41.575
Traitor.

28:07.442 --> 28:10.206
<i>Fire. All hands
report to damage control stations.</i>

28:11.112 --> 28:13.979
We got a fire!
Let's go. Clear the doors!

28:33.234 --> 28:34.462
Frack!

28:37.505 --> 28:39.632
No fires reported anywhere
on the ship, Commander.

28:39.707 --> 28:41.265
The exact location of the alarm.

28:41.342 --> 28:43.469
D- Wing corridor
where it intersects with C-Wing.

28:43.544 --> 28:44.943
That's the lab.

28:49.651 --> 28:51.209
Erase.

29:36.264 --> 29:37.731
Put it down!

29:38.933 --> 29:40.366
Put it down.

29:47.975 --> 29:49.374
All right, move in.

29:50.411 --> 29:51.537
Take him to the Brig.

29:51.612 --> 29:52.977
Yes, Commander.

29:54.382 --> 29:56.942
I would like to speak
to my attorney.

29:57.018 --> 29:58.747
Can't I speak to my attorney?

29:58.820 --> 30:01.948
I need some representation,
it's not what it looks like.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.787
She's got it in for me,
that Shelly Godfrey!

30:17.104 --> 30:18.093
Hey.

30:18.905 --> 30:21.339
Shut up.
All of you.

30:22.943 --> 30:27.107
Not one single word
from any of you, okay?

30:28.448 --> 30:30.245
What seems to be
the problem?

30:30.317 --> 30:33.184
Your new boyfriend's
a bit of a jerk, sir.

30:34.421 --> 30:35.581
It's a girl.

30:36.223 --> 30:40.216
If you don't mind her goo on
your face, she's all yours, sir.

30:41.428 --> 30:42.554
Okay.

30:42.629 --> 30:43.994
He likes
the warm light.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.594
Makes the touch
easier, right?

30:47.834 --> 30:50.769
Maybe, okay.

31:00.947 --> 31:02.847
This is stupid.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.308
This is stupid.

31:05.919 --> 31:09.685
It's worth a try, sir.
It did fly for you once.

31:09.756 --> 31:12.384
Hasn't made so much
as a grunt since.

31:13.627 --> 31:16.323
Maybe, I don't
know, take it for a ride.

31:16.396 --> 31:17.420
Ride it.

31:17.497 --> 31:20.762
Treat it like a horse.
Okay, a horse.

31:22.436 --> 31:25.200
Why not a goat?
That's good, right?

31:25.272 --> 31:28.901
Think of it as a goat.
Okay. Whatever.

31:30.944 --> 31:33.845
Come on, boy. Giddyup!

31:34.214 --> 31:35.203
Come on.

31:42.656 --> 31:46.217
Okay, you're kidding.
Chief?

31:47.861 --> 31:49.829
Don't shoot anything.

31:55.802 --> 31:57.030
Doctor.

32:03.043 --> 32:04.533
Madam President.

32:13.186 --> 32:16.747
I am so sorry.
Thank you.

32:27.634 --> 32:29.761
You are here to free me,
right?

32:30.937 --> 32:32.529
To bring this travesty
to a close...

32:32.606 --> 32:36.372
because you know I'm innocent.

32:37.177 --> 32:40.840
Just tell me,
so I understand...

32:41.715 --> 32:45.811
because I want to understand
why. Why you did it.

32:47.153 --> 32:50.281
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

32:51.691 --> 32:54.717
I'm being framed!
Why would she do that?

32:55.529 --> 32:57.429
Because she's a Cylon.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.022
She's a Cylon.

33:01.935 --> 33:03.732
You are going to have
to believe me.

33:03.803 --> 33:06.237
I want to believe you.

33:06.806 --> 33:10.936
I want to believe that I haven't made
such a profound error in judgment...

33:11.011 --> 33:12.672
in trusting you...

33:13.680 --> 33:15.614
and asking your advice.

33:18.418 --> 33:20.784
But here's where
we are, Doctor.

33:21.321 --> 33:23.414
If anyone
can be a Cylon...

33:23.490 --> 33:25.515
and it's hard
to tell us apart...

33:25.592 --> 33:28.322
then we only have
one thing left to trust:

33:28.595 --> 33:31.086
our instincts,
feelings.

33:32.999 --> 33:36.093
And the moment they told me it
was your face in the photo...

33:36.169 --> 33:38.000
I knew I believed it.

33:40.273 --> 33:43.037
I believe you're involved
in the attack.

33:44.678 --> 33:46.043
Somehow.

33:47.247 --> 33:48.612
I feel it.

33:51.351 --> 33:53.979
You'll forgive me,
Madam President...

33:55.555 --> 33:57.580
if I don't wish
to be executed...

33:57.657 --> 34:00.683
based solely
on your gut feeling.

34:10.303 --> 34:12.931
May the gods
have mercy on your soul.

34:21.081 --> 34:22.378
Call it.

34:25.018 --> 34:26.246
Heads.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.754
Heads. You win.
You sleep. I watch.

34:29.823 --> 34:32.291
No. You're the one
who needs sleep.

34:34.961 --> 34:38.761
I couldn't sleep if I had to listen
to Tyrol read the flight manual.

34:38.832 --> 34:39.924
Okay.

34:42.636 --> 34:46.231
Truth is if something
happened to you...

34:47.507 --> 34:50.067
I wouldn't know how
to deal with it.

34:51.478 --> 34:53.275
I feel the same way.

35:00.754 --> 35:02.551
Back on the ship...

35:04.624 --> 35:07.957
I knew what was going on. I
mean, between you and the Chief.

35:08.261 --> 35:10.126
I think everybody did.

35:10.930 --> 35:14.229
And I respected it.
Your feelings, his.

35:16.136 --> 35:19.299
But I would've given
anything to be him.

35:26.446 --> 35:28.175
I'm not trying to
put you on the spot here.

35:28.248 --> 35:29.943
I don't want to step
in what you two have.

35:30.016 --> 35:33.315
You feel the way you feel
and I have to respect it.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.381
No. It's not true.

36:45.325 --> 36:47.657
I know that we
haven't spoken before.

36:49.729 --> 36:51.856
And I don't wish to offend.

36:54.834 --> 36:56.199
Please.

37:01.574 --> 37:03.007
Dear God...

37:09.048 --> 37:12.142
and I now acknowledge
that you are the one true God.

37:15.655 --> 37:17.418
Deliver me from this evil...

37:22.529 --> 37:26.158
and I will devote the rest of
what is left of my wretched life...

37:29.135 --> 37:30.625
to doing good.

37:36.142 --> 37:38.474
I don't know what to...

37:39.779 --> 37:43.545
To carry out your divine will,
is what I want to do.

37:49.656 --> 37:51.920
To carry out your divine will.

38:07.207 --> 38:11.439
Grant me
grace and forgiveness.

38:22.989 --> 38:25.890
I'm here now.
I'm here.

38:29.062 --> 38:33.590
All will be well. It will
be as God wants it to be.

38:45.678 --> 38:46.770
Open the door.

38:49.716 --> 38:53.709
Wait. I haven't even
had a trial yet.

38:53.786 --> 38:56.414
No! Wait!
It's a lie!

38:56.956 --> 38:58.719
Doctor, it's all right.
It's a lie!

38:58.791 --> 39:00.986
The photograph was a fake.
What?

39:04.230 --> 39:07.097
It was almost seamless,
but your face...

39:07.166 --> 39:09.657
the man, the reflection,
it was all a fake.

39:12.438 --> 39:16.067
But of course it was a fake.
I'd never wear a shirt like that.

39:19.379 --> 39:21.210
How did you...

39:21.281 --> 39:24.011
I went back, I re-ran
all the security checks.

39:24.083 --> 39:28.315
This time I found markers which
pointed to photo manipulation.

39:30.023 --> 39:33.584
They weren't apparent until
the photo was fully resolved.

39:36.696 --> 39:38.994
You re-ran
the security checks?

39:42.835 --> 39:44.166
Thank you.

39:47.707 --> 39:52.303
I just knew that you could never
have anything to do with that attack.

39:52.812 --> 39:54.939
You're not
that kind of man.

40:00.820 --> 40:03.948
It was really nothing. Once the
photos were fully resolved...

40:04.023 --> 40:06.719
it was almost too easy, like
she wanted to be found out.

40:06.793 --> 40:08.761
How did she get off of the ship? Got me.

40:08.828 --> 40:10.887
There's been no ships coming
or going. I gave you an order.

40:10.964 --> 40:12.192
I had two Marines
tailing her.

40:12.265 --> 40:14.756
They say they went around
a corner and she was gone.

40:14.834 --> 40:17.598
Every ship in the fleet has reported
in, sir. There's no sign of her.

40:17.670 --> 40:21.106
That's unacceptable. She
was here. She was right here.

40:21.474 --> 40:24.204
This woman existed.
She didn't just vanish.

40:24.277 --> 40:25.869
Have them check again.

40:25.945 --> 40:28.846
Every ship? Every ship,
including this one.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.559
She didn't just vanish.

40:44.097 --> 40:47.464
... that he had been
a victim of treachery and deceit.

40:48.267 --> 40:51.293
Clearly, the Cylons wanted
to discredit Dr. Baltar...

40:51.371 --> 40:54.238
because of his work
on the Cylon detector.

40:54.907 --> 40:58.434
Dr. Baltar, it gives
me great pleasure...

40:58.511 --> 41:00.741
to exonerate
you publicly...

41:00.980 --> 41:03.915
and to recognize you,
once again, among us...

41:04.417 --> 41:07.909
as a scientist,
a leader, and a friend.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.390
<i>You're a hero.</i>

41:23.770 --> 41:27.228
You're even more popular
and powerful than ever before.

41:29.909 --> 41:34.642
You've had your trial by fire,
so now they truly believe in you.

41:37.150 --> 41:40.051
Hard for anyone to accuse
you of treason again.

41:45.591 --> 41:47.718
Was that the plan
all along?

41:49.595 --> 41:53.793
Build me up in the public mind
by first tearing me down?

41:56.436 --> 41:57.698
Right.

41:59.372 --> 42:02.432
Who am I to question the plans
of almighty God?

42:10.116 --> 42:14.280
Just one, small,
practical question.

42:16.122 --> 42:19.057
Shelly? Shelly Godfrey?

42:19.592 --> 42:22.925
Was there ever a woman
really called Shelly Godfrey?

42:23.463 --> 42:26.921
Did she ever actually exist?
Was she ever really here?

42:41.214 --> 42:42.943
God's will be done.
