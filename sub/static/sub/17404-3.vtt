WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Tonight, I eat a cabbage,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
James throws a bird out of a car

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
and Richard forgets
the abbreviation for America.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
USB.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
CHEERING

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Hello, everybody! Good evening.
Thank you so much.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Thank you, everybody. Now,

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
I want to start by talking
about Denmark because, you see,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
over the years, this tiny little
country has contributed

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
so much to the
betterment of mankind.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
It's given us interesting furniture,
stylish hi-fi,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
amusing children's toys
and, of course, this.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Danish bacon, Danish butter,
wrapped in bread,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
to create the only known cure

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
for vegetarianism.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
LAUGHTER

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Denmark, however,
has never made a car...until now.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Because Denmark has
more windmills per head

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
than any other country on Earth

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
and because Copenhagen
is a cyclist's paradise,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
you know exactly what
sort of car it's going to be.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah, well, it isn't.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
I was also expecting Hans Christian
Andersen with windscreen wipers

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
or The Little Mermaid
with door handles, but no.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What we've got instead is this.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
A 1,086 horsepower orange monster!

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
It's called the Zenvo ST1
and it is extremely fast.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
It's got a 6.8 litre V8...

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
..which is supercharged
AND turbocharged.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
And that's like smearing
a habanero chilli with wasabi

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
and then garnishing it
with dynamite.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
The net result is
a speedometer that can't keep up.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
It's just a blur.
138, 150, 170-something...

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
My God! No, no idea!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Apparently, however, flat out,
it will do 233mph.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
You know those Scandinavian
crime dramas,

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
lots of quietly thoughtful people in
jumpers looking out of the window?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
This is nothing like that.
Nothing at all.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
So, it is very definitely
a supercar.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And that's a problem

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
because who's going to say,
"No, I don't want a Ferrari

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
"or a Lamborghini
or a Pagani or a Bugatti

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
"or a Porsche or an Audi R8
or a McLaren or an Aston Martin

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
"I would rather spend my money
on something totally unproven,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
"preferably from a company
I've never heard of?"

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I mean, why would you do that?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
It's not like the engine is
made from the tears of an angel

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
by the gods of science
and precision.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
What's more,
it has conventional suspension

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and a heavy, steel chassis.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
However, because it's
a bit last-week, you can

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
have some old-fashioned
fun in the corners.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh-ho-ho!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
'But you can also have an accident.'

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Part of the problem is that
if you engage sport or race mode,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
the traction control is disengaged.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Now, this, according to
the - oops - chief engineer,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
makes it pretty much undrivable

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
He's right.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
He is right.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
There were also some issues
with quality.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
The lights filled with condensation,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
the rear brakes didn't seem to be
working properly,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
then the clutch went.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So the car had to go
back to Denmark.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
After a couple of weeks,
however, it was mended,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
so the Zenvo came back.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But almost immediately...

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
a cooling fan went wrong.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Fire, fire, fire! Copy that.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
So the car became even more orange.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
And that was the end of that.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
That didn't do very well.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How much is this thing?
How much? Mm.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
?800,000. 800?!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
LAUGHTER

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Yes. Are there any upsides to it?
Er, upsides, yes.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
The fire did get rid of
the condensation in the lights.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
LAUGHTER

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Apart from the fire?
Apart from the fire...

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Yes, it's surprisingly comfortable
and very quiet.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, it would be quiet.
It was broken.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes, but amazingly, they have
mended it again and it's back again.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And now we can find out how fast
it does a lap of our track,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
or rather IF it can do
a lap of our track.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
That, of course, means handing it
over to our tame racing driver

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Some say that this week
he is wearing two layers of Nomex.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
SLOW-BUILDING LAUGHTER

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And that on a recent trip
to Cornwall,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
he stopped off for one of his
special big wees in Somerset.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
LAUGHTER

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
All we know is he's called The Stig!

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
CHEERING

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
And he's off!

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Cautious start because
it is soaking out there today.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Be beautiful, though, if it catches
fire. Right, first corner.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Will it try to bite him?
Nothing so far.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Oh, no, wait, there is
a bit of a nibble at the end.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
DISCORDANT, DIRGE-LIKE
SINGING ON STEREO

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Absolutely no idea what
The Stig is listening to.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I do know, however, he is in full
race mode. No traction control

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
He is being cautious, though.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Right, through the Hammerhead.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, no, it's stepped out again,
but he has managed to hold it.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
God, that is very good driving!

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
DISCORDANT, DIRGE-LIKE
SINGING ON STEREO

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Right, is he going to lift?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Oh, yes, he is going to lift

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
because that thing is as racy
as the Danish Prime Minister.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Through the tyres.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Only two corners left.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
You can actually see it squirming on
the lake where our track used to be.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Only Gambon left before he can have
a lie down. Is he going to make it?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Is IT going to make it?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Yes, it has!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
CHEERING

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Now...

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I have the time here.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Remember, it is an ?800,000
1,000 horsepower car, so here we go.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
AUDIENCE: Ohhh...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
No, it's a bit lower. Really?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
AUDIENCE: Ohhh...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh-ho!

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
There you go, it's 1.29.9,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
slower than a Ford Focus.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
LAUGHTER

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
No, no, hang on a minute.
I'm sorry. Hang on a minute.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Let's be fair about it. We need to
look at another time for a wet lap.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
There you go. It's slower than
a German saloon car. It is!

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
You know this is Danish and it s
orange and it's genetically flawed?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm surprised they haven't
called The Giraffe...

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
LAUGHTER
..and shot it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
GROANS AND LAUGHTER

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
He said that out loud,
didn't he? He did.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
He said it out loud.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Never mind,
let's move on with the news

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and, well,
my big news this week, certainly

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
is I spent last weekend
driving the new Porsche 980.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, you did! It'll be on the show
later in the series. There it is.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Come on, quick, quick, now,
sneak preview. What is it like?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Well, Jennifer...

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
LAUGHTER

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Funny(!)

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, if you were watching last week,
Jeremy did say on the show,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
on TV, that if the Porsche
was faster than the McLaren,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
he would change his name to Jennifer.
Yes.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Didn't you, Jennifer? Well, it won't
be. See, I think it might just be.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Honestly, it... It's staggering
Really.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It doesn't accelerate
like most other cars.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You are not conscious of it

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
gaining speed through the gear
as the revs rise.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It doesn't go, "Ohhh-aaahhh!"

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
It just goes straight to, "Aaaaargh!"

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
But, Hammond... What?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
..the McLaren has more power
than the Porsche

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and is lighter than the Porsche
I know.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
But listen, Jennifer,
the Porsche has four-wheel-drive

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and four-wheel steer
and on our track...

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It will lose.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Listen, I'm sure the Luftwaffe
were very proud

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
and pleased with
the Messerschmitt Me 109.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
That was a damn good aeroplane.
Yes, but it wasn't...

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It wasn't as good as the Spitfire!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
No, you could do negative G
in the Messerschmitt 109.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
May, you are as bad as he is!
That is going to be humiliated.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
We are going to win. When I say we,
Britain is going to...

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm all for patriotism,
that's great,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
but you've just got to face facts.
The thing is astonishing.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
It's about how it manages those three
engines... Shut up about it!

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
LAUGHTER
I'm with you about
the British thing,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
but I sort of hope
the Porsche wins, JENNIFER.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
LAUGHTER

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The news has been
filled with a lot of scenes

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
of flood victims
all waving their arms around

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and going, "Oh, no,
what are we going to do?"

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
End of the world really.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, it certainly makes me
very sad because the answer,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
as we all know, is simple.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
You buy a Ford transit van,
cut a big hole in the floor,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
take the back doors off, couple
of engines in it, fans, skirts,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
put it in the water, it sinks.
That's true.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You get another transit van,
more powerful engines,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
totally redesigned. Here we go.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
LAUGHTER

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And it works perfectly.
That IS the solution.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
We predicted these floods six months
ago and came up with the solution.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
But what is really annoying
is that everybody

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
is blaming the floods on David
Cameron, the Environment Agency

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
pretty much anything you can name...

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Mm-mm, I know exactly
who is to blame

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
for this problem
everybody is having.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Miranda Hart.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
LAUGHTER

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
You laugh, but here's the thing

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
We are sitting here
now on a Sunday evening.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Eight, nine million people
in Britain have chosen to watch

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
some 1950s midwifery
on the other side,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
so they don't know
about the hover-van.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
That is the problem.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
They have chosen Miranda over us
and our show is

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
rammed full of helpful hints and
useful consumer advice. Every week!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
LAUGHTER

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Now, hey, listen, how long has
the Gallardo been in production

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
17,000 years? Just over? Just over.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I know there are cave drawings of
it in the Pyrenees. There are.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Well, Lamborghini has announced
they are stopping making it

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
and are going to replace it with
this. It's called the Huracan.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
600 horsepower, 5.2 litre V10,
four-wheel-drive.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
None of that is interesting

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
because if you're interested in
speed and power and handling,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
you're going to buy a Ferrari 4 8
or a McLaren 12C, aren't you?

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
The only reason you want to buy a
Lamborghini is because it looks mad.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And that's very nice, but I don t
think it's bonkers enough.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I know what you mean.
It looks nice, but...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, it needs to be outrageous
It does.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Nobody should be allowed
to design a Lamborghini

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
unless they've just consumed
two bottles of absinthe.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
LAUGHTER
Now you're ready!

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
The essence of it is,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
it doesn't really matter
how a Lamborghini drives

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
because a Lamborghini
is for prowling around the city

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Ferraris are for doing
a 2.35 around Silverstone.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Lamborghinis are for doing
Knightsbridge at 2.35am.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Yes, yes.
LAUGHTER

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Now, there's a new type of gas
which is worrying the government.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Is it cyanide? No.
Is it carbon dioxide?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
No, it used to be carbon dioxide.
Now the days where...

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I can hardly bring myself
to say this.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
They are very worried
about a terrifying new combination

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
of nitrogen and oxygen.
What, you mean air? Yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
99% of the air that we breathe
is nitrogen and oxygen,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
but the government has got
his knickers in a twist about it,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
specifically about nitrogen dioxide
and I've done some checking.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Bear with me on this.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
It mostly comes from
soil or stoves

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
or particularly from lorries
in stop-start city driving, OK?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So the government has decided to
address the problem

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
by limiting cars to 60mph on the M1
just outside Sheffield.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
That's their solution.
But that's got nothing to do with it!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Isn't that like saying,
"I've got toothache,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
"I think I'll go and have
a hair cut. That will sort it."

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
"Doctor, I've twisted my ankle.
"You must put on a bomber jacket "

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
The thing is, they actually say
"Well, it's as European law,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
"so we have to lower
the speed limit."

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Germans aren't, French aren't,
Italians aren't, only we are.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And I know exactly
what's happened here.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You've got some guy
in the government, you know...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
LAUGHTER

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
You know the type. Oh, yes, right.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
OK, now, he has the power
to lower the speed limit

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
and stop parents eating sandwiches
in cars if kids are present,

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
but what he needs to do is take
a leaf out of the Queen's book.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
What, marry a Greek? No!
LAUGHTER

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
The Queen has
the constitutional power

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
to declare war on another country,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
but she never does.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Even after a big party
where she's a bit...

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and all her mates
are egging her on.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
"Go on, Liz! Declare war on
someone!" Can she really do that?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Yes, she can do that, but she
doesn't. "Hello is that Mr Hollande?

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
"This is the Queen. WE ARE AT WAR!"
I'd do that every week!

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
She could do that. I'd be
constant... I'd do it every...

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
"Oh, God, what have I done?"

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah, I would love to be
a drunk Queen!

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
LAUGHTER

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I didn't mean...

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Shall we move it on? Yes. Yes.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Every week, we receive thousands
of letters from people that say

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
"Dear Top so-called Gear,
why do you never test the sort of

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
"affordable cars that normal
people are likely to buy and drive?"

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Well, the truth is, we would love
to. But the producers won't let us.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
It's frustrating,
because contrary to public opinion,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
we really do like small,
sensible little cars.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
I mean, he has a Fiat Panda.
I have a Fiat 500.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, and I have a very small
AMG Mercedes.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
LAUGHTER

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Very small indeed.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
We like the way that small cars
are easy to park and cheap to run,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
but, most of all,
we like the way that a lot of them

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
are very good fun to drive.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
But the producers say they aren t,
they say they're boring.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
And to prove their point,
they came up with a challenge.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
Yes, they told us to choose three
one-litre, three-cylinder,

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
little city cars and report
with them to the Crimean peninsula.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
So, here it is,
at the bottom end of Ukraine,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
jutting out into the Black Sea.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
The Crimean peninsula, 10,000 square
miles of history, beetroot

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and girls who leave the West behind.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And this is where we were to meet,
the city of Yalta.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Outside the very building
where Churchill, Stalin

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
and Roosevelt met to carve up Europe
after Hitler's defeat.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Hammond was the first to arrive

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I have brought,
as you can see, a Fiesta.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Which is a very, very good
small car in any case,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
but in this instance,
particularly good,

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
because this one is fitted with
an absolute jewel of an engine.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's a tiny, one-litre,
three-cylinder EcoBoost,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
and when I say tiny,
I mean REALLY tiny.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
The block of that engine
would fit on an A4 piece of paper.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And it's magnificent.
Right, who's that?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, it's the orang-utan. Here we go.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Congratulations. What, why?

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
Because that is unquestionably
the best one-litre little car

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
of them all. No doubt about it.
The engine in this... Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
It is phenomenal. 125 horsepower,
from one litre. I know!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
And 65 miles to the gallon.
Honestly...

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Why are you saying these things
and why, then, are you not in one?

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Why are you in that VW? It's the Up!

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Well, I brought this because
I like it. Hang on, you've just ..

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
No, I like it. This is brilliant.
But I like this.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Let me put it to you this way.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
You can buy better dogs
than my West Highland terrier,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
but I LIKE my West Highland terrier.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Yes, it bites the postman
and it lays dog eggs all over

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
the kitchen and it steals food
but it's brilliant! And it goes ..

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
If this had ears,
it would go like that...

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
'Sadly, at this point,
my dog impersonation was

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
'interrupted by the arrival
of Captain Interesting.'

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
That's the most boring looking car
I've... What is it? I'm nodding off!

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
Good news! What? It's
a Dacia Sandero. Is it? Yes.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Anyway, we were just
saying before you got here,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
this is just an epic little car

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
It's quite expensive, though,
isn't it? How much is it? 17,50 .

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
?17,500? Yup.
And how much is yours? 7,500.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
That's a big price gulf,
Hammond. It is...

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I can afford to lose this
and just go and buy another one

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
and I'm still better off than you.
Look at it! It's... It looks great.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
It's anti-fashion, it's a car for
people with more sense than money.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
It works, it's cheap. Wow,
how have they done it so cheaply ?)

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
You can't work it out, can you?
There is no obvious...
It's amazing(!)

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That steering wheel,
what a quality item(!)

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
That's exactly the same as yours! It
isn't the same! It's the same SHAPE.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
And correct me if I'm wrong,
it was a Renault Clio 30 years ago.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Not 30 years ago.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
It's BASED on the underpinnings and
mechanicals of the old Renault Clio.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
An old car. Basically, I've brought
an iPod to a gramophone convention.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Utter rubbish! Look at it!

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
'Our argument was then interrupted
by the arrival of a challenge.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
They still don't believe that
we like small cars. But we do!

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I love my Fiesta. Right.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
"Between Yalta and Sevastopol,
there is an excellent coast road,

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
"which you would enjoy very much
in a normal car.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
"But you will not be able
to enjoy it

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
"in your miserable little
shopping carts"?!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Hello!

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
You can't get away from the fact
the Fiesta, in any guise,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
is a brilliant little car.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
The chassis is so sorted out!

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
I've driven the ST version,
the hot one, and it is simply superb.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
What's incredible is that they
haven't lost any of that liveliness,

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
that excitement, that thrill, by
fitting it with a tiny, tiny engine.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
It's like driving a cartoon!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
BRAKES SQUEAL

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Squealing!

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Bit of turbo boost,
bit of traction control wise.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
That means I'm having fun
and I'm on the ragged edge.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Hee-hee!

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
Unlike the Ford and the Dacia,
the Up! doesn't have a turbocharger.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
But even so, it still feels like
a determined spur.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm going to get there first!
Yes, I am, get out of my way!

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Woo-ha-ha!

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
And stick it into the bend...

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I mean, if I were in even a Ferrari
on this road, I'd be thinking

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
"Oh, no, I'm going
to scrape my nose!

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
"How much power do I need here
and how much braking?" And I don't

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
have to worry about any of that,
because the Up! has no power at all.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
You just put your foot hard down
and leave it there!

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Much to the annoyance
of the producers,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
we have loved our drive
on the wiggly road.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
But we loved what we found
at the other end of it even more.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
A disused Soviet submarine base

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Now, ordinarily, we would have
to park in the car park there.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
But because our cars are so little,
we won't.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
This is remarkable.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
James Bond could not have
got in here!

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Because of course,
his Aston Martin is too large.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Good God!

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Look at that!

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
In the event of a nuclear war,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
they could get 14 submarines
in here, and 3,000 people.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It's under a mountain!

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, it is your actual
under-a-mountain submarine base

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
It's full-on Bond.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
How much energy and effort
was expended by MI6

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
and the CIA trying to find out
the details of this place?

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
And here I am, driving through it!

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Sadly, we spent so long
driving around the sub pen...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
..that night was falling
by the time we reached

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
the busy city of Sevastopol.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
And here, the Up!'s lack of oomph
was a bit of an issue.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh, I'm being squeezed!

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
I've lost it.
Being strashed by a Lada 2107!

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
However, because the VW
is smaller than the Ford

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
and the Dacia, I didn't have to park
miles and miles from the hotel.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Is that legal? No.
Where does it say "no parking"?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But it doesn't say "no parking"
in a lot of places where it's

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
obviously not quite right to park.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
To be fair,
it doesn't say "no murdering" either.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
The next morning,
we continued our journey through

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
a region where the hills were once
soaked with British blood.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
The Crimean War may have been
unfathomable,

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
nobody really knew why it started,
but the legacy is enormous.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
It gave us important words
like balaclava and cardigan.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It gave us Florence Nightingale

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
the world's first war photographer,
the world's first war reporter.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
The Victoria Cross was first awarded
to soldiers who fought here

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
And even today,
the medal is made from metal

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
taken from a Russian gun
that was captured here.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
Then, of course, there's
the best-known legacy of them all.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
How's it go?

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
"Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
"Theirs but to do and die."

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
"Into the valley of death rode
the 600." And that is the valley.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
That is where the Charge of the
Light Brigade actually happened

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It was a misunderstood order.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, they were supposed to go
up there somewhere.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
They were supposed to
snout around in the hills,
looking for the Russians,

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
misunderstood it, came charging
over here armed with sabres,
against the entire Russian

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
artillery here, all of it was there,
pointing straight at them.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And they were on horses with sabres.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
How could that possibly end?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh, God!

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
Choose your moments!
Exactly. Exactly.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
"Ukraine is the second largest
country in Europe, and now you will

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
"drive all the way across it,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
"from here in the far south to
the Belarus border in the north

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
"It will be worse than those
long journeys you did

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
"as a kid in the back of
a family car to the seaside.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
"It will be the journey from hell."

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
How can it be worse than those
journeys? I was a kid then!

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
I was in the back of
a Mark I Cortina.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I was in the back
of an Austin 1100.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Anglia, with a hole in the floor
How far is it? It doesn't...

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
How far is it? It's 750 miles.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
750 miles? What, in a Volkswagen
Up!? That's easy. Piece of ca..

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
In these three cars - light cars -

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
we shall be the modern-day
Charge of the Light Brigade.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Very good.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Still feeling slightly baffled,
we set off.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
Well, I think the producers have
gone a bit soft, to be honest.

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
It's just not in any way difficult,
challenging... It's just...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
It's easy!

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
APPLAUSE

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
750 miles!

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
It turned out not to be easy at all.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Yes, in the second
part of that film,

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
which we'll show you later on,
I was actually killed.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah, he really was.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
So, that's something for us
all to look forward to.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yes, thank you, Hammond.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
But in the meantime, we must put
a Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
Now, my guest tonight is the only
British musician who can

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
drive a tank, fire a mortar
and strip an assault rifle.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Apart from Posh Spice, obviously.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
How you doing, big man?
How are you? I'm well.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
Hi there. How are you doing? Hi
Hello. He's here. Have a seat.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
All right. Many whistlings!

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
First of all, congratulations
on your forthcoming marriage.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
I'm getting married? BLEEP!

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
You're getting married to the girl
standing behind you. Fantastic

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Just in case you'd forgotten.
No, there she is, look.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
LAUGHTER
What's your name? Aah!

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
That's the ticket. OK, great.
So, when are you getting married?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
September.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm just thinking, I know there s
lots of girls here and they'll

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
want me to ask lots of questions
about it, but I can't think of any.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Shall we talk about the Army?
Let's talk about the Army.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
The Army's better. We've got
to do the Army, it's easier.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Now, we know you were in the Army,
of course, that is well documented.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
But I think what a lot of people
don't know is that you actually

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
single-handedly,
when you were in Kosovo,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
stopped World War III
from happening.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm glad you brought this up. Yeah.
Because it's time the nation knew.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Actually, it was genuinely
the most incredible day of my life.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Other than my forthcoming marriage.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And, er... It was...

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
You know, having bombed the crap
out of the Serbs,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
we signed a peace accord
and we pushed up to Pristina,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
the capital, and I was remarkably
put as truly the first officer

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
to lead 30,000 people up there,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
and when we got to the airport
in Pristina, General Wesley Clark

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
told us to just overrun

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
and overpower the 200 Russians
who had beaten us to the airport

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
The American general?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah, and we asked several times -
that one thing means destroy them?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Which seemed a pretty stupid thing
to do. He said destroy...

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
He said overrun and overpower,
definitely using some political
manoeuvring in his wording.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
And after, you know,
five minutes of arguing,

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
a very special man called
General Mike Jackson,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
an incredible character
who I would follow anywhere,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
came up on the radio and said,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
"This is ridiculous,
I'm not having my soldiers being

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
"responsible for starting
World War III,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
"let's push off somewhere else.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And when the Russians
had run out of food and water,

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
they came back and asked us for food
and water and we said,
"Sure, if you share the airport "

30:05.000 --> 30:11.000
That was an order from an American
to a British captain to...

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
And he later then ran
for president in America. I know

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Let's move on to music.
We've covered the army.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
You saved the world from
World War III, which is good.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Your new album is called
Moon Landing.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Moon Landing, which I only
discovered after the event

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
that "moon landing" is actually
in the Urban Dictionary

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
as a term in the gym when two men
are changing and they bend over

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
and their bottoms touch accidentally.
So, yeah...

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
There's a single called
Heart To Heart, isn't there? Yes.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Now, forgive me for saying this
my daughter,

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
she said to me a couple of days ago,
"I was going to tweet James

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
"to say how much I love that song,"
but she said, "I was so worried

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
"that his tweet reply would rip me
apart that I haven't dared do it."

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
I wouldn't abuse her,
if she's nice.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
What have you just won on Twitter?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
It's something, the best
twitterer... Best Comebacks.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
The Best Comebacks, from the chap
over there with windswept hair

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
I've actually got a few
of your ones here.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Don't they take a long time
to think of?

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I would say I'm spontaneous with it,
but I might be lying.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Somebody said here, "Why have you
only got 200,000 followers?"

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And you replied,
"Jesus only needed 12."

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
APPLAUSE

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
You've got to admit...
they are properly very funny.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
"James Blunt has an annoying face
and a highly irritating voice.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You went, "Yes, and no mortgage "

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Do you mind if I show them
my absolute favourite? Go for it.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
The rather sarky,
"Whatever happened to James Blunt?"

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
And this was the picture you posted.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
What I love about you is the way
that somebody is abusive to you

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
and you just take it on the chin and
are fine. I sob uncontrollably.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I mean, people take Twitter
far too seriously.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It's just,
there's a real world out there,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
and people seem to think
that Twitter is important.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
It's just people opinions,
and opinions are like arseholes

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Everyone has one. Yeah. Cars.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
When you were last here, I think

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
the only car you'd ever driven
at the time was a Lada.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah, I was really embarrassed about
that, and I've tried to upgrade.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I had a Lada Riva 1.3SL, for "slow".

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Because now, obviously,
things have moved on dramatically.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
You've got a tuk-tuk.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
I have a tuk-tuk from Bangkok,
which is awesome, three-wheeled

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
vehicle, does 70mph, and I drive it
around home in Ibiza.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
It does 70?

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
70mph, and if you get all your mates
in the back,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
you can wheelie as well, at 70mph.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Actually, my best friend is a
chap called Nin, he's Indian,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
and he insists on driving to make it
look more authentic.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
LAUGHTER

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
When you're in London, I gather
you've now got a bicycle. Yeah.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Why do you have a bicycle?
It's much, much faster
and it's good exercise.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
You can lose a paunch with a bicycle.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
I've got a bicycle, and look what
it's done to me. Literally.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
You're not supposed to eat it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah...

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
Now, you recently had an altercation
with a paparazzi photographer,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I believe, in the United States

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, paps are quite aggressive
and yes,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
I was coming out of a party
and I was with someone who

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
was in the public eye as well,
and they shout. Paps don't want

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
an ordinary picture,
they want an aggressive picture

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
and they're all banging
on the window,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
and one of them fell in front of the
car, and what are you supposed to do?

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
He's fallen down and I wouldn't want
to incriminate myself by saying

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
that I hadn't spotted him and touched
the throttle and went gently over.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
That would be the wrong thing to do.
But... But we did go over him

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Did you actually feel the dum-dum?
Yes.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Something strangely
satisfying about it.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
And in the meantime, the police
and the ambulance did arrive,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
but before they arrived, he got up
and took pictures of more people

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
They even had some film footage
from another paparazzi of him

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
rubbing his leg, saying,
"Make it redder, make it redder,

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
and when the police arrived, he said,
"Poor me, I've been run over.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
But it was a very small hire car
and I think it was fine.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
It wasn't a large American Cadillac?
No. Get one of those next time.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Anyway, the lap,
how was it out there today?

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I think as I was driving down today,
they said today was the first

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
day of the year the Met Office has
issued a red weather warning -

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
do not leave home unless you
specifically have to,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
and I've been doing laps.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
The thing is, as you know,
everybody who comes down here

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
goes off at the second to last
corner, that's a given, really,

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
but I heard that James went off
on the Follow Through.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And I followed through
at the time as well!

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
That's why it's called
the Follow Through,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
because that's a 100mph corner,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
and you have that building in front
of you, and if things start to

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
go wrong through there,
it's actually a slightly
buttock-clenching...

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Very much. And some of your camera
crew are lucky to be alive. Yeah

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
Would anybody like to see this
moment when one of our guests

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
actually went off on
the Follow Through? AUDIENCE: Yes.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Let's have a look at this.
Here we go.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
That is absolutely soaking.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
That's properly fast, and you keep
your foot in it until, look at this!

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
What I love about that is
you did not apply the brakes

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
until you were an inch
from the edge of the track.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
Everyone says you're not allowed
to lift off and so I tried not to.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
We're talking big cojones there

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It's actually because I couldn't see
through the windscreen.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I didn't know I was coming off.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
It started to get bumpy and green -
"This has definitely gone wrong."

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Anyway, eventually,
we did get a lap together.
Yeah. Who'd like to see it?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah! Here we go.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
See, I think this is
the Blitz spirit.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Come on, then! BLEEP!

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
It's like a BLEEP lake out here

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Yeah, nobody's complaining
about the Environment Agency,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
you're going in there, "Why don t
you come and clear it up?"

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
That is so wet!

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Stayed on the track nicely.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
It's like ice skating.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Not that I ice skate very often

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
You really should have borrowed
Richard Hammond's booster cushion.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
I needed Moses to part the sea.
There's a private jet over there

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
That could get me home!
Ibiza, right.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Hammerhead, probably couldn't even
see the lines,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
so that's pretty impressive.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
Here we go, right, coming up to
the Follow Through again. So slow.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Up to 6,000. And again,
I can't see a BLEEP thing.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
This is, I really admire you
for doing this.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
A touch of the brakes, and I can't
say I blame you. Through the tyres.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
No whingeing, no complaining.
And, yeah, going to make that one.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
Not bad at all, actually.
And it's blowing a gale.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Whoa! It's the Jimmy Carr line!
There we are. Across the line.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
That is really, properly...
I've never seen it like that.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah, it was fascinating,
because last time

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
I came down it was wet as well, and
basically, whenever you have me on,

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
unsurprisingly, it is the wettest,
James Blunt is the wettest lap.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
We have had two previous wet laps
in the last couple of weeks.

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
Hugh Bonneville at 1.50.1,
Tom Hiddleston last week at 1.4 .9,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
so bearing in mind, he was very wet,
but nothing like...

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Not nearly as wet as me. So come on,
where do you think you come?

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I really hope I haven't
humiliated myself too much.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
No, you haven't humiliated yourself,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
because you went out there, which is
brave enough, and you drove around

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
in it, which is very marvellous
and you looked determined.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Like one of those schools
where everyone's a winner.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
So there we are, fastest lap so far,
1.49.9. You did...

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
I have to say... That is the fastest
wet lap. You are above Ron Howard.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And just under Joss Stone.
I'm always under some... Anyway

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
Feel the eyes in the back of my head.
Yes. I can see them.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
You're between
Joss Stone and Ron Howard.
That's a very odd place to be.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
That was quite something.
It really was. Thank you.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Thank you.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Now, tonight we are trying to prove
that we really do like small cars,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
and our producers are trying
to prove that they're rubbish.

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
Yes, so, they told us to drive
our three one-litre hatchbacks

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
all the way across Ukraine,

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
a trip they said would be
the journey from hell.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Why do they think this is going
to be the journey from hell?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Driving across the Ukraine.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
We've only been here 24 hours,
we've been through the Cold War

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
the Second World War, the Crimean
War. It's going to be tremendous.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
And I'm in my Up!

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
In the not too distant past,
little cars like ours

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
were very spartan, but these days,
if you choose your car wisely

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
you get loads of stuff to play with.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Right, Hammond, have you got your
air conditioning set just so?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I have, yes, I've set it
just half a degree lower

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
than would be too comfortable.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
This heated seat, I think,
just to the first position.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
USB.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
'USB iPod.'

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Bluetoothed my iPod
into the stereo system.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Heated windscreen, let me try that.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Cruise control. Haven't done that.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Yep, a mirror on that side.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
Eventually, though, even Hammond and
I ran out of things to play with,

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
so we turned our attention
to the Ukrainian scenery.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
A hill or two wouldn't go amiss

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Right, I admit it, this is boring.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Do you think
we're halfway there yet?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
We needed to find out.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
So, as we couldn't understand
the writing on our sat-nav systems,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
we pulled over to consult a map

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
We came from down here, yes?

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
And we've got to go
all the way there.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
We've just gone through a town
called Pravda.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
We can't be further back than that.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Maybe it's in...
Can't be there. We've done that

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
Oh, Christ, oh no! It's there. Don't
be daft! It is! We're only here!

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
We've only done that. We've only
driven over the Isle of Wight.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
We've got to come here? How come ..
We've only got there?!

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
And that's good news. Is it? How is
that good news? It's good news.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Really? Yes.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Instead of just sitting and,
"I'm bored,"

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
why don't we make ourselves more
rounded human beings on the journey?

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
So while we're in the car
we learn to do some thing?

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
Exactly! We could sit there going,
"I'm bored, I'm bored,
I wish I wasn't doing this,"

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
or we can simply say, "No, we shall
use this time constructively.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
We will arrive in Belarus
more intelligent

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
and more rounded than we are now.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Back on the road,
the self-improvement began.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
'Hello and welcome to

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000

"And following the book."

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Well, we've eaten. Shall we go?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000

had been cleared away..

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000

And behind him, this.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
An abandoned nuclear missile base.

That's a silo. It's ever so big

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Ta-da!

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
I'm afraid not. You can't change
your mind about the card you chose.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
That was the card you chose.
You can't tell me what card I chose.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
But I know you chose that
because I read your mind.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Magicians are supposed to exercise a
degree of finesse, not just bullying.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
The following morning,

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
we were warned there was a mob on
the streets of Kiev, and there was.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Thank you for coming,
thank you so much.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
So, to get a bit of peace and quiet,

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
we were told to report to
the country's only racetrack...

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
..for what, chillingly,
was called the final challenge.

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
"Your cars will each be given
exactly 23 litres of fuel,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
"which, because
they're so economical,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
"should easily be enough for them to
cover the 100 or so miles

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
"to your destination, a town
near the border with Belarus."

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Hang on, 23 litres? To do 100 miles?
That's not really a challenge, is it?

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
That's easy! "Your challenge is to
run out before you get there." Eh?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
"This is something you
will want to do,

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
"as the town in question
is called...

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
"..Chernobyl."

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Can we actually...
We can't go there, can we?

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
Chernobyl was the scene of
the world's worst nuclear accident.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
When reactor number four
exploded in 1986,

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
it released a radioactive cloud
so devastating that the entire area

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
will remain uninhabitable
for 20,000 years.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
And unless we could make our cars
do less than 20 miles to the gallon,

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
this is where we'd end up.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
Ford claim mine does 65mpg.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
All the way here, this has done 60
miles to the gallon, give or take.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
Yes. How would you make these cars
do 20 miles to the gallon?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I can't imagine getting it under 30.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
After the producers had put
precisely 23 litres of fuel

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
in each tank, we did some
preparations of our own.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Right.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Clever, this.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
What I'm going to do is let
about 30% of the pressure
out of the tyres.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
The point is,
it increases rolling resistance

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
which means I use more fuel.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
That is one heavy Up!

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
What are you doing?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I'm sealing all the gaps so that
radioactive dust can't get in.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
What you've done there, Hammond
is made it more aerodynamic.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I have, haven't I? You have. Goodbye.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
To get through this much petrol
in less than 100 miles,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
we would have to drive like maniacs.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Three, two, one.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
ENGINES REV FURIOUSLY

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Come on! Build up the revs!

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Second gear. Right to the limiter.
God, that's wasteful.

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
James and I decided to go for
a low-gear policy of maximum revs.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Hammond, on the other hand...

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
If I keep doing this all the way
there, I'll go further.

51:36.000 --> 51:42.000
It will be twice the distance. This
is the answer. Lock to lock. Ooh!

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
TRUCK HORN BEEPS

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
That's where I'm going
to have to be careful,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
when there's traffic
coming the other way.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I've just realised!

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm driving without the lights on.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I'm driving with
the eco-engine system...

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Heated rear window, I want that on.
Heated seats, yes.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
That's better.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Probably people think
this is a bit odd,

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
but if they knew why I was doing it,
they would understand.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
I can't believe
they're making us do this,

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
because it's not like the
radioactivity has gone. It hasn t.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
It has a half-life, material that's
left, of 245,000 years.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
And James May, obviously,
can explain what a half-life is

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
In fact, he probably is doing.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
A half-life is actually constant.
A piece of uranium

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
will have a half-life
and when that half-life is passed,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
the remaining bit
still has the same half-life.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
I think the word was coined
by Marie Curie.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
The early 20th century was the time

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
when radioactivity was identified
and discovered...

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
After 25 miles of red-line motoring,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
the news from the Up!
still wasn't good.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
I've managed to average
23 miles to the gallon.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
I've got to get that down.
How do I get that down?

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
Right, the drag is now
dramatically worsened.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Meanwhile...

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
I am feeling a bit sick now,
if I'm honest.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
Oh, is that a police car? Oh, dear.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
There's the horrible evidence.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
At a quarter distance, 25.5 miles,

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
I should have lost one of those
four bars that I started with.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
But it's not happening.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
Come on, petrol! Sod off.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
OK, we've been pulled by the police.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
They were wondering
why I was zigzagging.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
They're talking to
the camera car in front.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here
at max RPM to try and use some fuel

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
while I'm stationary.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Whilst Hammond was deafening
the police,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
I pulled over to disable
my engine management system.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
How about that!

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Engine warning light.
Yes. That's what we want.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
What the engine has to do now
is assume a sort of
worst-case scenario,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
because it doesn't know
anything about itself,

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
so it will assume it's very cold,
the fuel quality is bad,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
so it must be less efficient.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
30 miles from Chernobyl,
all our cars were still running

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
and we were trying every trick in
the book to make them conk out

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Look at that for drag now!

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
Brake. Then accelerate.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Then brake. Accelerate.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Still got three bars! Come on!

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
There it is! 17.8mpg.
My fuel light has come on! Oh, yeah.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
I'm doing 21 miles to the gallon.
I'm not doing well enough!

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Everything's on empty.
The needle, on empty.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Come on, run out. Run out.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
It's one degree out there.
Nipples are sticking out badly.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
Ah! I believe this is
Richard Hammond.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
This thing should not be moving

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
I'm going! I'm going! I am going!
Don't tell me you've run out. Yes!

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
Yes! Ha ha! Oh, bliss! It's gone

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I don't believe you. It...

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
ENGINE SHUDDERS

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
I don't believe you. Sit rep.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Richard Hammond is a BLEEP.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Go on. Go and meet your fate.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
The un-turbo-charged Up! continued
onwards. And then...

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
Oh, wait a minute. What do we have
here? Some kind of checkpoint

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
The barrier marked the start of
the 30km exclusion zone,

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
and now I'd have to go through it.
So would James.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
But who would film
what happened afterwards?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Three main cameramen. Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
They're getting in a taxi
and going back to Kiev. What?

58:11.000 --> 58:41.000
Thare's snmethinf like 07 tonnds

58:42.305 --> 58:48.371
