WEBVTT

01:27.505 --> 01:30.007
Betty,
get out of the way.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.887
"She put her arms
around his neck"

01:34.970 --> 01:36.680
and hung there
as he opened her trousers.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.933
Then he placed both hands
behind her buttocks

01:39.016 --> 01:39.892
and lifted her.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.352
"She gave a little hop..."

01:41.435 --> 01:42.812
Like a bunny?

01:42.895 --> 01:44.980
Hey, y'all.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.441
What do you want, Betty?

01:47.525 --> 01:49.902
Are y'all reading
Lucy and Sonny at the wedding?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.195
It's so dirty.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.446
No.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.240
Mama and Daddy wouldn't
like you reading this.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.158
You're too young.

01:56.242 --> 01:58.661
My favorite part is,
"Her hand closed around

01:58.744 --> 02:01.664
an enormous blood-gorged
pole of muscle."

02:04.250 --> 02:06.377
It's not a muscle.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.840
Janis, your little sister is
such a weirdo. God, I know.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.175
Betty, come on over here
and help me with these beans.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.929
Would
you listen to those fool men?

02:18.389 --> 02:19.890
Why don't
I chop some celery?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.684
You can probably use it
in your casserole.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.102
Oh,
casserole's done, Butch,

02:23.185 --> 02:25.104
but here, you can
pour that bacon grease

02:25.187 --> 02:27.481
out of the skillet into the
Luzianne can right there.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.858
Well, how heavy is that skillet?

02:28.941 --> 02:31.193
I have bursitis
in my good arm, you know?

02:31.277 --> 02:33.112
- Really?
- Why don't you just

02:33.195 --> 02:34.488
let me handle it, Aunt Butch.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.240
We wouldn't want you
messing up your good arm.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.825
Well, thank you, Neva, honey.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.451
What was it that happened
to your bad arm?

02:39.535 --> 02:40.911
Honey,
don't you remember?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.913
The Christmas before last,
I slipped.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.498
I got a hairline fracture

02:44.582 --> 02:46.792
in the metacarpal bone
in my right hand.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.002
I didn't remember that.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.837
It just swole up like a balloon.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.925
Get those
young'uns out of here!

02:55.009 --> 02:57.469
It's a hot stove, and I don't
want nobody to get burned!

02:57.553 --> 03:00.431
Bullet, Mae Ray, listen to
Mammaw. Come on, go outside.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.807
Betty, take these kids outside.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.226
Come on, y'all.
Let's go outside.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.229
What in the world is
the matter with that child?

03:07.313 --> 03:09.398
I mean it, Bullet.
I'll slap you so hard,

03:09.481 --> 03:10.983
your clothes will go out of style.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.860
Ah, what'd I miss?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.862
Hey, y'all
know what's good for you,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.864
you won't go in there
for a while. All right.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.115
Gross, Daddy.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.950
All right. Oh, goddamn it.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.912
Move! Move. You're in front
of my Falcons game. Move.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.331
Bullet, Mae Ray, get.
Y'all, let's go outside.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.708
Get!
Bullet, Mae Ray, get.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.919
Get the hell out of here!

03:32.004 --> 03:33.380
Goddamn it!

03:33.464 --> 03:35.841
I'll whup you both
with my handsaw!

03:37.259 --> 03:40.429
- Jesus Christ.
- Bullet! Mae Ray!

03:55.361 --> 03:57.279
I was always happy
when my Uncle Frank came

03:57.363 --> 03:59.156
for one of his rare visits.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.866
Sit down.

04:00.950 --> 04:03.160
Nobody else in my family
ever seemed interested in me.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.412
You ever read Madame Bovary?

04:05.496 --> 04:06.956
No, I haven't.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.083
But Uncle Frank was different.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.711
He was a college professor,
and he lived in New York City.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.130
He used aftershave.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.007
His fingernails
were always clipped.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.468
And he wore a gold chain
underneath his shirt.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.930
I could listen to him
talk all day.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.767
Oof, well,
um, supposedly...

04:26.850 --> 04:29.395
He was the only adult that I
knew who looked me in the eye...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.231
I like...
I don't like...

04:32.314 --> 04:34.692
...who was curious about
what I had to say...

04:36.610 --> 04:39.488
...and who liked
to make me laugh.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.992
And in the summer
of 1969, when I was 14...

04:44.243 --> 04:45.869
that was exhilarating.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.290
I'll open this
one right here. Get ready.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.459
Here we go. Oh!

04:52.543 --> 04:54.044
Thank you, Marsha.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.547
A man can always use
an extra pair of socks.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.507
Oh, well, it's from me
and Tee Dub.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.010
Happy birthday, Daddy Mac. I hope
you don't mind me calling you that.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.096
Hey, you gonna be a member of this
family, you'd better call me Daddy Mac.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.935
Open another one!
Bullet! Enough, goddamn it!

05:14.148 --> 05:15.524
Hey, now.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.901
That's how you handle
a rambunctious child.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.073
Thanks.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.325
Well, that one's wrapped up

05:25.409 --> 05:27.202
so nice, it must be from Frank.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.246
Oh. Must be.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.170
- What is it?
- Wow!

05:36.253 --> 05:37.880
An electric shoe polisher.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.718
You think I'm too old
to polish my own shoes,

05:42.801 --> 05:45.679
need a goddamn machine to do it?

05:45.763 --> 05:47.598
Of course not. No, I...

05:47.681 --> 05:49.808
It's... I have one.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.102
It's just faster and easier.

05:55.773 --> 05:56.774
Next!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.698
Well, I sure do appreciate
your gift, Frank,

06:04.782 --> 06:07.034
since I'm the one
who always ends up

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
polishing your daddy's shoes.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.746
Hm.
Thank you, darling.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.749
Here you go, Daddy.
That's from me and Kitty.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.626
Ooh, look at that.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.336
Aw, look.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.505
It's a little,
itty-bitty screwdriver.

06:19.588 --> 06:24.176
It's a glasses repair kit for when you
lose a screw from your frames and whatnot.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.636
Yeah, well,
I could use these a lot.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.305
I'm always fixing
my reading glasses.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.057
Thank you, Mike, Kitty.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.475
- And Janis.
- Mm-hm.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.268
- And Betty and Bullet.
- Yep.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.395
Happy birthday, Daddy Mac!

06:39.817 --> 06:43.237
I never knew why Daddy
Mac was so mean to Uncle Frank

06:43.320 --> 06:46.156
or why nobody else
ever said anything about it.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.367
Well, okay.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.828
Can I go to the bathroom?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.413
Yeah, if you promise
to wash your hands.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.208
I might understand
if Uncle Frank was selfish

06:56.291 --> 06:59.419
or rude or snobby,
but he wasn't.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.297
He was smart and funny
and considerate.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.842
He was the kind of person
I wanted to be.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.136
But he was the one Daddy Mac
picked on

07:07.219 --> 07:09.847
and belittled
in front of everybody.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.851
Uncle Frank was good at
hiding how much it hurt him,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.894
but I could see it.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.820
Uncle Frank, what is it like
living in New York City?

07:27.156 --> 07:28.657
Oh, I love it.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.121
See, once you get out of
a town like Creekville,

07:34.204 --> 07:36.415
not only do you see
how small your world was,

07:36.498 --> 07:39.251
you also see how much bigger
it could become.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.628
In ways you never even
thought possible.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.259
Can I come visit you sometime?

07:50.596 --> 07:53.056
Yeah. Sure.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.933
If your parents agree to it.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.145
Of course they won't.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.439
They wouldn't even let me go
to majorette camp.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.192
Well, Daddy, he said,
no daughter of his

08:03.275 --> 08:05.110
was gonna prance around
half naked

08:05.194 --> 08:06.570
in front of the whole town.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.113
I'd probably end up
getting raped,

08:08.197 --> 08:10.199
and you know what,
I would deserve it.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.701
He said that?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.786
Mama says it's just
the beer talking.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.043
How are your grades, Betty?

08:21.126 --> 08:22.294
All A's.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.129
All A's, huh? No B's?

08:24.213 --> 08:25.839
Mm, no.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.549
Good. Keep that up.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.927
Ace your SAT.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.096
You could get a scholarship to
just about anywhere you want to go.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.225
Oh.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.186
Probably just go to SC State
like most of my class.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.063
Ah, come on, now.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.273
You gonna be the person
you decide to be,

08:43.357 --> 08:46.193
or are you gonna be the person
everyone else tells you you are?

08:47.653 --> 08:50.322
'Cause you get to choose.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.490
You do.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.122
I wish I wasn't named Betty.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.042
It's a lady name,
and I'm only 14.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.418
So change it.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.631
I can't just change my name.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.258
You can do anything you want.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.426
What about "Liz"?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.595
No?

09:13.679 --> 09:14.930
"Liza"?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.056
"Betsy"?

09:18.433 --> 09:21.061
Uh, maybe "Beth"?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.021
Yeah, I like "Beth."

09:23.105 --> 09:25.857
And there are so many things
a Beth can accomplish

09:25.941 --> 09:28.068
besides being a majorette.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.237
My cousin Marsha's a majorette.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.032
Yes, she is, and please don't do
what your idiot cousin Marsha did.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.826
She got herself pregnant,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.370
and now she's gonna have to
marry that imbecilic young man.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.955
Marsha's pregnant?

09:40.038 --> 09:41.123
Shh.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.215
If ever you need me
to pretend to be your father

09:50.299 --> 09:51.675
so you can get birth control,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.303
I will be more than happy
to do that.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.971
Look at me.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.976
And if you do find yourself
getting knocked up,

10:01.059 --> 10:04.438
you call me first before you
talk to anyone else in this family.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.151
I promise.

10:11.903 --> 10:12.946
Okay.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.326
You want me to leave
Madame Bovary for you?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.119
Oh, that would be great.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.040
Thank you.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.420
Attention, new students.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
Please allow
our student ambassadors

10:30.213 --> 10:33.091
to show you around
the NYU campus.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.510
These student-led tours
depart every half hour.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.721
Uh, Bledsoe.
First name Beth.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.934
Uh, Elizabeth.
I'm sorry.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.563
Thank you.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.107
That was scrumptious.
Wasn't that scrumptious?

10:49.191 --> 10:51.443
Charlotte!
What was that salad?

10:51.526 --> 10:53.945
Oh. It's called tabbouleh.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.907
I never thought
to put rice on a salad.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.867
Oh, no, that's bulgur.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.703
- What's vulgar?
- Uh, uh, bulgur.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.288
It's made from a wheat.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.500
Sure was interesting.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.252
That smells so good.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.545
What is it?

11:10.629 --> 11:13.423
Oh, it's beef.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.716
Lamb.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.426
It's sfeeha.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.261
That.
Sfeeha?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.931
Yeah, it's kind of like
a shepherd's pie.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.682
Huh?

11:22.766 --> 11:24.267
She is such a good cook.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.103
She's been slaving away all day.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.854
Oh, slaving?

11:27.938 --> 11:30.524
And you are such
a good boyfriend.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.026
Charlotte,
it's so good to meet you.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.946
I have to say that no one
in Frank's family

11:36.029 --> 11:37.447
has ever even heard of you.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.740
I know.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.784
It's crazy, right?
Uh-huh.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.204
Especially since we've been
together almost five years.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.580
Shut your mouth!

11:45.664 --> 11:48.041
Yes, Charlotte, shut your mouth.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.627
I bet it's because
of the Jewish thing.

11:52.671 --> 11:53.964
What Jewish thing?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.258
Oh, well,
Frank probably thought

11:56.341 --> 11:57.801
that you would all disapprove

11:57.884 --> 11:59.970
of him living in sin
with a dirty Jew.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.680
Sweetheart.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.808
Uh-huh? You remember
what we decided tonight.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.726
No, uh, politics...

12:06.810 --> 12:08.687
No religion.
That's right.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.106
Of course, yes.
I'm so sorry.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.859
- I'm just a bitch.
- Mm.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.610
That's what Mike calls me.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.654
Oh...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.365
I think we're gonna
get along just fine.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.909
Hell, I'm just glad
you ain't black.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.959
Okay, let's not forget
why we're all here.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.172
To Miss Elizabeth Bledsoe,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.466
New York University freshman,

12:37.549 --> 12:39.092
class of 1976.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.928
America's birthday.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.639
It's all just beginning
for you, Beth.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.725
Mazel tov.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.227
Mazel top.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.230
Congrats.
Congrats.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.607
Enjoy.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.654
Do you mind if I sit here?

13:01.781 --> 13:02.908
No, of course not.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.327
I'm Bruce.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.162
Hi. I'm Beth.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.705
Where are you from, Beth?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.416
South Carolina.
Charleston?

13:11.500 --> 13:14.961
No, a tiny little town you've
never heard of, I'm sure.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.213
Well, try me.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.217
Creekville.
Never heard of it.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.304
I'm from Bismarck, North Dakota,

13:24.387 --> 13:27.182
but I tell people
I'm from Greenwich.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.059
I've decided I'm gonna be
who I want to be

13:29.142 --> 13:32.103
instead of letting other
people dictate who I am.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.523
Other people
or facts, apparently.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.237
Favorite author.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.656
I can't pick just one.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.741
Okay. Favorite authors.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.955
Carson McCullers.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.790
Eudora Welty.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.500
Harper Lee.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.710
Jane Austen, of course.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.879
Uh, Charlotte Bronte.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.965
No men. Hmm.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.508
Mark Twain.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.134
You?

14:03.218 --> 14:06.805
Well, Shakespeare. Dickens.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.515
Mark Twain.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.851
Ken Kesey. William Styron.
Truman Capote.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.020
No women.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.897
Grace Metalious.
Jacqueline Susann.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.941
Sure.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.985
Actually,
I want to take this, um...

14:20.068 --> 14:23.822
this class on 19th-century
women writers.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.616
Uh, I think the
professor's name is Bledsoe.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.327
I hear he's amazing.
Frank Bledsoe?

14:29.411 --> 14:31.288
Uh, he's my uncle.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.372
Seriously?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.582
Yeah.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.755
Would you mind introducing
me to him? I mean, at some point.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.508
Something tells me that you and I are
gonna be spending a lot of time together.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.387
I hope so.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.198
You okay?

15:07.282 --> 15:10.869
Yeah, uh, I-I just...
Uh, I've never...

15:12.078 --> 15:13.788
Oh.
But I want to.

15:13.872 --> 15:14.831
I just...
No.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.583
No, no, we should wait.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.835
No, it's okay. I just...
No, no.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.380
I don't want to screw things up

15:22.464 --> 15:23.965
by moving too fast.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.425
I like you too much.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.137
We can keep making out, though.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.472
Okay.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.651
Come in.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.783
I will be right with you.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.997
And... yes.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.957
Oh, Beth!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.959
Hi. I've been
meaning to call you.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.629
I've been snowed under.
How are you?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.424
How are you adjusting
to college?

16:06.508 --> 16:08.301
To New York?
I love it.

16:08.385 --> 16:12.389
But, um, this is my
boyfriend Bruce.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.641
Your...

16:14.724 --> 16:17.227
Okay. It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.978
I've heard raves
about your class.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.355
Good to meet you.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.358
Um...

16:23.441 --> 16:25.735
unfortunately, you
caught me at a bad time.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.278
I have to type an exam

16:27.362 --> 16:29.989
and get copies made
before 3:00, so...

16:30.073 --> 16:31.282
Oh, okay.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.410
But I will call you, I promise.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.578
Sure.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.122
Bye.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.710
I should've called him first.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.629
Hey, Frank, what time does
your party start tonight?

16:44.713 --> 16:47.549
Around 8:00.
Should I bring a guest?

16:47.632 --> 16:49.092
- No.
- You'd better.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.844
Okay.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.178
I'll see you there.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.349
No.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.398
Hello.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.278
Who are you?
Oh, uh, hi.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.445
Hi.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.406
Uh, I'm Beth Bledsoe,
Frank's niece.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.200
Frank's niece?

17:14.284 --> 17:15.868
Oh, my God, Beth.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.329
Hey! Nice meeting you.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.498
Oh, my God.
My name is Wally.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.958
How are you?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.836
I've been begging Frank
to introduce us.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.463
Hi. I'm Bruce.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.923
Oh, my goodness.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.050
I'm just not sure why he
didn't tell me you were coming.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.887
Oh, that's because
he doesn't know.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.430
He doesn't know?

17:35.513 --> 17:37.182
Oh, I thought
he wanted to surprise me.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.185
Well, okay,
it's gonna be very exciting.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.644
I'm excited. Come on in.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.646
Come in, come in, please!

17:43.730 --> 17:44.856
Shut the door behind you.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.734
Hey. Don't smoke in here.
It's illegal.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.195
I don't want to go to jail.
Why not? It's a party.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.113
Shut up.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.032
So, uh, how do
you know Uncle Frank?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.161
Uh, he's my roommate.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.079
Why?

18:00.163 --> 18:03.541
Oh, uh, I thought
he lived with Charlotte.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.085
Yes, he does.
We all... We live together

18:06.169 --> 18:09.005
because it's
a big apartment and, uh...

18:09.088 --> 18:12.842
and, uh, rent is very expensive.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.637
Uh, tell you what,
I'm gonna go track him down,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.514
and you're gonna stay here.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.974
Uh, do not move.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.309
No, I'm serious, Beth.
Do not move.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.560
Okay. Okay.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.770
Look at this smile.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.442
I'm gonna go find the alcohol.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.027
Oh, what do you want?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.654
Uh, surprise me.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.492
Hey, Frank.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.081
Seriously?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.499
This is what you do?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.960
Have sex in
other people's homes?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.212
We're not having sex.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.422
Hm. Okay.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.303
By the way,
Frank's niece is here,

18:57.387 --> 18:59.889
and you may need to be
a slut of a girlfriend... again.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.183
I cannot believe
you are still pissed at me

19:02.267 --> 19:04.352
for getting to meet
Frank's brother's family.

19:04.435 --> 19:08.523
Don't you ever take credit
for my cooking, Charlotte.

19:08.606 --> 19:09.816
I mean it.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.194
Okay, go on.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.125
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just, um...

19:27.208 --> 19:29.168
You want a drink?

19:29.252 --> 19:30.211
Uh, sure.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.380
I'll have a martini.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.424
Gin or vodka?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.801
Uh, vodka.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.011
Olive?

19:38.094 --> 19:40.263
Sure. Why not?

19:40.346 --> 19:41.764
I love your hair.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.516
Oh, thanks.
I love yours.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.729
Enjoy.
Thank you.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.819
Oh, fuck Agnew.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.196
It's Nixon who needs to go.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.284
He's such a snake.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.120
He'll figure out a way
to stay in power.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.538
I don't know, Bernard.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.374
I have more faith in
the system than you do.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.710
It's not hard to do,
as I have none.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.174
You are...?

20:16.257 --> 20:17.634
Bruce.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.886
- Bruce.
- Hi.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.179
Hi.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.305
Bernard.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.226
What are you, uh...

20:27.310 --> 20:29.646
I came here with Beth.
Beth is here?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.022
Don't worry, Frank.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.690
We're a lot hipper
than you think.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.449
I believe I'll go get
another drink.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.123
Beth's a sweet girl.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.917
Yeah, she's a very sweet girl.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.962
I'm not sure
where she gets the idea

20:54.045 --> 20:55.380
I'm her boyfriend.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.508
We haven't had sex.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.677
It's not like we ever will.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.138
She's not really my type.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.323
Do you honestly believe
that I'll risk my job,

21:22.407 --> 21:25.410
my relationship, my entire life

21:25.493 --> 21:28.329
just to have sex with you?

21:29.998 --> 21:31.416
Who has to know?

21:31.499 --> 21:32.750
You think I've never had sex

21:32.834 --> 21:34.961
with a beautiful
young man, Bruce?

21:35.044 --> 21:37.171
Hell, I used to be
a beautiful young man.

21:37.255 --> 21:38.423
You still are.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.675
Come on, let it go.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.220
My blow jobs are like poetry.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.515
How?

21:49.350 --> 21:51.519
In what way is a blow job
like poetry, Bruce?

21:51.602 --> 21:53.521
Does it rhyme?
Is it metered?

21:53.604 --> 21:55.606
Does it employ
aesthetic qualities

21:55.690 --> 21:57.483
in addition to or instead of

21:57.567 --> 21:59.444
its notional
and semantic content?

22:02.321 --> 22:04.323
Wow, you flunk.

22:04.407 --> 22:07.410
Unaccustomed to not getting
what you want,

22:07.493 --> 22:08.786
aren't you, Bruce?

22:10.413 --> 22:11.748
Seriously?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.708
Seriously, get out of here.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.544
Come on, get out of here.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.046
Come on.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.436
Where have you been?
Whoa.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.063
You've had enough.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.689
Oh, no, it's a martini.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.316
Uh, listen, Beth, I need to go.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.234
Your uncle completely
flipped out on me.

22:40.318 --> 22:43.321
I think he's stoned.
On pot?

22:43.404 --> 22:45.323
God only knows what
he's going to tell you.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.657
Call me.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.334
It's okay, Beth. Come on.
What did you say to Bruce?

22:56.417 --> 22:57.794
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.463
Oh, nope. Not on the
rug. Come on.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.757
There you go. Yeah.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.759
You're gonna feel
so much better after this.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.177
Believe me.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.429
Hey, Frank.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.598
I've been looking
for you everywhere

23:10.681 --> 23:13.434
to warn you that she
was here.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.228
Oh, Beth.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.063
She's okay.
What happened?

23:17.146 --> 23:18.648
You little poor thing.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.526
So, where were you?

23:22.443 --> 23:23.694
I was on the fire stairs.

23:23.778 --> 23:24.862
With?

23:26.656 --> 23:28.991
Bernard.
Bernard the pothead?

23:30.451 --> 23:31.577
Can we not, in front of her?

23:31.661 --> 23:32.829
Oh, don't worry about that.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.539
She's not gonna remember
any of it.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.748
Here.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.876
Did you smoke pot?

23:38.960 --> 23:40.294
Yes. It's a party.

23:40.378 --> 23:41.754
Yeah, and you're sober.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.550
And marijuana is not alcohol.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.511
No, but it's illegal.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.514
And you smoke it outside
where anybody can smell it.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.107
Did he make a play for you?

24:01.190 --> 24:04.110
He's way too repressed
to ever do anything like that.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.531
Her boyfriend did, though.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.366
That shrimp?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.910
Oh, I did not like him
the minute I saw him.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.456
Bruce said you freaked out.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.750
Why'd you freak out?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.545
Uh...

24:33.556 --> 24:35.850
Beth, do you know what, um...

24:35.933 --> 24:37.143
Wow.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.483
Okay, do you know
what being gay means?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.910
Well...

24:57.038 --> 24:58.664
I'm gay.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.458
And so is Wally.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.340
Um, we live together.
We have for ten years.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.927
And the reason
I freaked out is because...

25:11.010 --> 25:14.347
Bruce tried, rather ineptly
to seduce me,

25:14.430 --> 25:16.557
and he seemed unwilling
to take no for an answer.

25:16.641 --> 25:20.811
So I hope you weren't
too invested in him,

25:20.895 --> 25:23.648
because he seems a little, um...

25:23.731 --> 25:24.774
Gay.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.317
Not worth it.

25:30.488 --> 25:33.699
No, come on. Luckily, you
don't need to think about

25:33.783 --> 25:35.910
any of that right now.
All you need to do is

25:35.993 --> 25:37.578
go to the guest room
and pass out.

25:37.662 --> 25:39.830
I'll clean this up later.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.874
Oh, don't worry.
I'll do it.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.601
You came out to Beth tonight.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.855
I know.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.941
I did not expect that to happen.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.652
It gave me a boner.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.365
Also unexpected.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.697
There's coffee on the table,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.324
two aspirin
and a big glass of water.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.909
You should...
You should drink it.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.624
Oh, please tell me
you eat bacon.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.295
Good, 'cause Wally, he
hates even the smell of it.

27:09.378 --> 27:13.257
But I'm a good Southern boy,
and bacon's in my blood.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.808
So, you feel
any different about me?

27:25.686 --> 27:28.439
Oh, I don't think so.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.108
Never known anybody
who was gay before.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.401
Of course you have.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.403
You just weren't aware of it.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.865
Choir director
at First Baptist Church.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.826
Mr. Dickerson?
But he's so...

27:40.910 --> 27:42.536
What?

27:42.620 --> 27:45.039
Religious.
Beth...

27:47.333 --> 27:50.920
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone in the family about me.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.507
Oh, sure, of course.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.551
Eh, we're from
such different worlds now.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.970
- It wouldn't do any...
- Change anything?

28:00.054 --> 28:02.056
You don't see
them anyways, Frank.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.394
Hey, Beth.
How you feeling?

28:06.477 --> 28:09.230
When's the last time
you saw your family?

28:09.313 --> 28:12.400
Uh, I think August of last year.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.903
Good morning, Barbara Stanwyck.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.116
I go there at least every
two years. You know that.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.743
He shows them photographs
of a phony wife,

28:22.827 --> 28:24.995
who's also played
by Charlotte, by the way.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.415
You want eggs?
Yes, please.

28:27.498 --> 28:31.043
If I told them I was with a man,
it would bring shame on them.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.045
Why do you think it wouldn't
bring shame on my family?

28:33.129 --> 28:35.464
Americans don't care
about honor, Frank.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.133
Ha!

28:37.216 --> 28:40.302
I wish I thought my family
could get past it, but I don't.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.847
I think your family
would eventually accept it.

28:42.930 --> 28:46.392
Here you go. Yeah,
well, you don't know my family.

28:46.475 --> 28:51.439
Thank you. No, but you came
from them, so how bad can they be?

28:56.652 --> 28:58.279
How about this?

28:58.362 --> 29:00.030
How about...

29:00.114 --> 29:02.116
you tell your family,
and then I'll tell mine.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.619
Are you kidding? In Saudi
Arabia, they would behead me.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.706
Ugh.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.499
Your bacon smells like death.

29:13.461 --> 29:14.795
Delicious death.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.088
And this music.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.673
Ugh.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.261
Oh, come on, now, Wally.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.762
Please?

29:23.846 --> 29:26.515
Oh, no. Oh, no.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.561
What are you doing?

29:33.189 --> 29:34.607
Oh, that's your phone.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.027
Beth.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.571
Have you met Barbara Stanwyck?

29:40.654 --> 29:42.364
Yeah, hello?
Hey, Mama. Isn't she cute?

29:42.448 --> 29:43.949
- She's the cutest thing ever.
- Frank,

29:44.033 --> 29:46.577
your daddy's gone.
He's gone.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.705
What?
He died this morning.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.873
Oh, Frank.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.583
How?
Heart attack.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.752
Just out of nowhere,
getting into the car. Okay.

29:54.835 --> 29:58.047
He seemed perfectly okay,
then he grabbed his arm. Mama...

29:58.130 --> 30:01.675
Oh,
Frank, what am I gonna do?

30:01.759 --> 30:04.386
Oh, wait, your sister's here.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.638
Do you mind holding on?

30:05.721 --> 30:07.890
No, I'm okay.
Hold on.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.775
And what time's
that land in Greenville?

30:17.858 --> 30:19.610
Yes, okay, Mama.
I promise.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.195
Is that
the last flight of the day?

30:21.278 --> 30:24.823
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Eastern, 235.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.283
Okay.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.910
She doesn't want me to fly.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.872
Uh, she's scared of it.
She gets hysterical.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.875
She's not the one flying.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.586
She made me promise
I would take the train.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.130
You can take the car.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.882
Can you hold on for a second?

30:41.966 --> 30:43.717
It's faster than the train,
and it'll give you guys

30:43.801 --> 30:46.220
a chance to get
to know each other.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.972
I would love that.

30:48.055 --> 30:49.223
Yeah.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.103
What? Are you seriously
thinking of not going?

30:54.186 --> 30:58.232
Frank, that'll break your
mother's heart. You need to go.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.067
You need to stay
out of this, please.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.530
You're not gonna run away
from this

31:04.613 --> 31:05.739
your whole life, you know?

31:09.535 --> 31:10.953
Please, Uncle Frank?

31:15.958 --> 31:17.293
Fuck.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.837
Um, okay, sorry.
Uh, change of plans.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.470
We can take turns driving.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.890
No, Wally, you're not coming.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.311
You're pushing me away again.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.146
Just when you're gonna
need me the most.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.939
I didn't come
to your father's funeral.

31:39.023 --> 31:41.233
No, I did not want you to
come to my father's funeral.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.152
Yes,
and I respected your wishes,

31:43.235 --> 31:45.070
and I didn't try to talk you
into letting me.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.655
It's not the same thing.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.574
I have a question. Are you
the stupidest man alive?

31:48.657 --> 31:51.285
Obviously.
Look who I'm with.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.499
Look.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.043
You need me for this.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.172
You know you do.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.013
Wally, I appreciate
you wanting to be there

32:11.096 --> 32:14.224
for me, I do, but honestly,

32:14.308 --> 32:16.852
it will be so much
harder for me if you come.

32:22.191 --> 32:24.109
Okay.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.277
Thank you.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.656
I'm gonna do the dishes.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.809
It's so weird.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.560
I'll never see Daddy Mac again.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.771
You've never known
anyone who died?

33:00.854 --> 33:04.316
There was this one boy in high
school who got killed in a car wreck.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.694
But I didn't know him well.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.029
Some of the other kids who never
even talked to him when he was alive

33:09.113 --> 33:12.324
started acting like
he was their best friend.

33:12.408 --> 33:16.537
So they could cry and people
would feel sorry for 'em.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.414
People are idiots.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.000
I know. Aren't they?
Yep.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.545
â™ª Cool jerk â™ª

33:25.921 --> 33:27.423
What does Wally do?

33:27.506 --> 33:29.717
Oh, he's
an aeronautics engineer.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.302
Where'd you meet him?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.848
On the subway.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.936
I was reading Seven Pillars
of Wisdom by T.E. Lawrence,

33:41.019 --> 33:42.771
and he asked me why
I was reading it.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.232
And I told him I'd just seen
the film Lawrence of Arabia.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.234
And he said,
"Well, I'm from Arabia."

33:47.317 --> 33:49.528
And...

33:49.611 --> 33:51.947
I don't know, we got to talking.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.661
Okay.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.539
Saved my life.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.293
What about you?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.295
Any boyfriends?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.713
Besides the idiot Bruce.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.341
No, I'm still a virgin.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.927
Not because I want to be.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.597
Just none of the boys I've known
seemed worth the trouble.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.100
I almost did it with Bruce,
but he said...

34:20.184 --> 34:21.310
He said what?

34:21.393 --> 34:23.520
It's too soon?

34:23.603 --> 34:26.063
Doesn't want to mess up
your friendship?

34:26.148 --> 34:27.858
Something like that?

34:27.940 --> 34:29.818
You think that's
because he's gay?

34:29.902 --> 34:34.281
Oh, I think 99% of straight boys
would have gone ahead with it.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.996
I just thought it was my fault.

34:42.873 --> 34:45.583
Guys like Bruce always
make you think it's your fault.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.213
What a jerk.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.590
That's letting him off too easy.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.382
He's an asshole.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.385
You can call him
an asshole, can't you?

34:55.469 --> 34:57.930
- What an asshole.
- There you go.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.264
What a fucking asshole.

34:59.348 --> 35:00.682
There you go.

35:03.227 --> 35:05.646
"See the world's
largest teapot."

35:05.729 --> 35:08.774
Yeah, or George
Washington's outdoor bathtub.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.151
Mm. What is the Mystery Hole?

35:11.235 --> 35:12.361
The what?

35:12.444 --> 35:15.239
"See the unbelievable
Mystery Hole."

35:15.322 --> 35:17.115
Uh, I don't think
we need to go there.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.457
Did you always know
you were gay?

35:35.050 --> 35:38.220
I... I always knew
I was different.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.222
From day one.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.934
But I... I definitely knew
by the time I hit puberty.

35:44.017 --> 35:47.729
You have to realize,
it wasn't talked about then

35:47.813 --> 35:49.064
the way it is now.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.193
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.614
Well, heck, I feel that way.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.784
What about you?

36:03.370 --> 36:04.955
You ever get a crush on a girl?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.167
What?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.545
Uh, not really.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.755
One time, uh,

36:13.839 --> 36:17.467
I practiced making out with
Becky Eller at a sleepover.

36:17.551 --> 36:20.429
Oh... But I pretended
she was a boy.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.181
And how... How was it?

36:23.265 --> 36:25.475
Embarrassing.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.151
When was the first time
you, um...

36:36.862 --> 36:38.363
I was 16.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.158
Who was it with?

36:41.241 --> 36:42.242
Just a boy from school.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.120
Ma'am, could we get the check?

37:03.513 --> 37:05.849
Come on, Sam!

37:08.977 --> 37:10.604
Sam!

37:48.850 --> 37:51.853
There's a graveyard
statue in Parkersburg that weeps.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.146
What?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.357
Apparently, she grants wishes.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.236
What's wrong?

38:02.489 --> 38:03.740
Stay here.

38:18.714 --> 38:19.923
Hello?

38:28.890 --> 38:29.933
Wally?

38:30.017 --> 38:31.685
Oh, hey.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.354
What the fuck are you
doing here, Wally?

38:34.438 --> 38:35.689
You scared me half to death.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.859
You forgot your razor, uh,
and your favorite tie.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.117
You rented a car just to
bring me a razor and a tie?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.410
Isn't it snazzy?

38:48.493 --> 38:49.828
Look, it's a convertible.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.163
You agreed to stay home.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.332
Just admit you're glad I'm here.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.084
Jesus.
Come on.

38:56.168 --> 38:59.129
And stop acting like your
father dying is not a big deal.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.797
Of course it's a big
fucking deal, Wally.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.549
It could end up being
a positive thing.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.176
You need to be part
of your family.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.219
I don't want to be
a part of my family.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.430
- Bullshit, and you know it.
- Wally?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.223
Get back in the car!

39:10.307 --> 39:12.309
Hey, don't talk to her like
this. She's not your kid.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.769
Beth, stay.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.064
Stay.

39:25.447 --> 39:29.159
Look, I just want to help,
however you might need it.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.412
And you know you're going to.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.876
You were there for me
when I did.

39:40.796 --> 39:42.798
You can't meet them, Wally.
You can't.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.930
Okay, I won't.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.556
And you can't come
to the funeral.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.311
But you can come to me
whenever you need to.

40:04.194 --> 40:08.240
So, that's
two rooms at $14 each.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.908
Uh, I don't think
we need two rooms.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.203
We can make do with just one
if you have a cot.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.125
What is the relationship?

40:19.251 --> 40:20.418
Uh...
Hmm?

40:20.502 --> 40:21.670
The relationship

40:21.753 --> 40:23.797
between the two of you...

40:23.880 --> 40:26.174
uh, and the young lady
over there.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.469
Oh, she's my niece.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.348
I'm his nephew.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.854
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
the young lady

40:38.937 --> 40:40.605
to stay in her own room.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.485
Yeah, that makes sense.

40:45.569 --> 40:47.487
Okay. Yeah.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.074
I used to fantasize
about different ways

40:51.158 --> 40:53.410
for my father to die.

40:53.493 --> 40:57.164
Which, of course,
I felt tremendous guilt about.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.833
You WASPs, you love your guilt.

40:59.916 --> 41:03.295
That's actually not true.
I fucking hate it.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.339
You know, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

41:06.423 --> 41:09.050
Mm, I know it intellectually.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.552
Just make sure
you don't bury it all

41:10.635 --> 41:13.972
inside yourself
and explode later.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.432
Probably at me.

41:15.515 --> 41:19.644
You look like you belong
in a 1950s Bible movie.

41:19.728 --> 41:21.062
Oh, yeah? I do?

41:23.440 --> 41:24.733
Blessed be thou, Samuel.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.568
Here he is, David.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.712
Hey, Beth?

41:45.795 --> 41:47.005
You want to ride with me?

41:48.298 --> 41:51.134
Uh, is that okay with you?

41:51.218 --> 41:54.221
Of course it's okay.
Why wouldn't it be okay?

41:54.304 --> 41:55.388
Okay.

41:59.309 --> 42:02.270
He's cranky today.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.438
Bye.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.110
So, Beth...

42:10.820 --> 42:13.365
Answer one question for me.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.075
Why is your uncle so odd?

42:15.158 --> 42:17.035
What's odd about him?

42:17.118 --> 42:19.037
"What's odd about him?"
He's the oddest man

42:19.120 --> 42:20.497
I've ever seen in my whole life.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.874
He seems pretty normal to me.

42:22.958 --> 42:26.002
Really? Huh.

42:26.086 --> 42:28.672
He's so stoic, Beth.
Like a mule.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.509
There's a layer between him
and the rest of the world.

42:32.592 --> 42:33.760
You know what I mean?

42:35.011 --> 42:36.721
Uh, not really.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.599
I don't really know him
that well.

42:39.683 --> 42:42.102
But I've always liked him.
Oh, dear.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.603
You're just like him.

42:43.687 --> 42:44.854
Must be hereditary.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.276
You guys are so nice

42:49.359 --> 42:51.027
all the time.

42:51.111 --> 42:54.489
I mean, don't you get exhausted
being nice all the time?

43:58.386 --> 44:00.972
I know that
Frank's father's the devil

44:01.056 --> 44:02.640
and his mom's a saint.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.145
His sister knows
about me, apparently.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.646
She does?
Mm-hm.

44:08.730 --> 44:11.149
Oh, that's my Aunt Neva.
She's real nice.

44:11.232 --> 44:14.402
Beth, I'm not
interested in nice.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.783
Nice always hides something.

44:19.866 --> 44:22.827
What's hidden
is what interests me.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.500
What about his brother?

44:28.583 --> 44:30.126
What's he like?

44:30.210 --> 44:31.669
Well, his brother's my daddy,

44:31.753 --> 44:35.048
and he's not
that nice sometimes.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.759
But how is he not nice?
He says mean things.

44:37.842 --> 44:39.177
Like what?

44:39.260 --> 44:42.347
Like, um...
like I'm a little smart-ass,

44:42.430 --> 44:45.475
and ain't no man likes
a girl with a smart mouth.

44:45.558 --> 44:47.602
Yep, he's right about that.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.979
Most men don't.

44:50.063 --> 44:51.773
I think I'm gonna like your dad.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.442
I really do.

44:54.526 --> 44:55.985
What about your family?
Are they...

44:56.069 --> 44:57.612
Oh, they're very nice.
All right.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.155
They're crazy.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.993
My mom is a woman
with a smart mouth.

45:04.077 --> 45:06.371
And indeed,
my dad did not like it.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.332
But she's got so much love.

45:09.416 --> 45:11.209
She's my heart.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.008
What the...?

45:19.092 --> 45:20.844
Oh, come on!

45:25.390 --> 45:26.724
What'd you do to the car?

45:28.726 --> 45:31.312
Well,
how long's that gonna take?

45:31.396 --> 45:33.106
I'm gonna have to wait to
get you a new torque converter

45:33.189 --> 45:34.399
in from Greensboro.

45:34.482 --> 45:36.443
Earliest I can have it in
for you is Monday.

45:36.526 --> 45:38.236
See, that's not an option.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.779
Well, ain't no other'n
I can think of.

45:39.863 --> 45:41.781
Fuck.

45:42.740 --> 45:43.950
Just leave it here.

45:44.033 --> 45:45.493
You can pick it up
on our way back to New York.

45:45.577 --> 45:49.372
J.B. don't usually like
doing that, but...

45:49.456 --> 45:50.707
I'm gonna say yes.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.333
'Cause if y'all come back,

45:52.417 --> 45:54.711
that means I get to see this
pretty little lady again.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.593
I'm just playing with you.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.180
Y'all don't mind, do you?

46:09.225 --> 46:12.520
You don't need these men's
permission to play with me.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.481
You need mine.

46:14.564 --> 46:16.107
Which I will never,
ever give you,

46:16.191 --> 46:18.943
because you are presumptuous
and disrespectful.

46:19.027 --> 46:21.905
And you're probably
even stupider than you look.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.992
And you look
pretty goddamn stupid.

46:41.257 --> 46:44.511
You made me
feel sorry for that boy.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.179
Gross.

46:46.262 --> 46:48.556
Look at it from
his perspective, Beth.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.141
You're a pretty girl.

46:50.225 --> 46:51.893
You're wearing nice makeup.
You're wearing nice clothes.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.645
So it's my fault he's a creep?

46:53.728 --> 46:55.355
You'll have to
forgive Wally, Beth.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.065
In the country
that he comes from,

46:57.148 --> 46:59.150
they like to wrap women up
in sheets

46:59.234 --> 47:01.653
and lock 'em away because
they're just too dangerous.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.863
That's why I left.
Oh.

47:03.947 --> 47:06.699
That and the execution
of homosexuals.

47:06.783 --> 47:08.284
Seriously?

47:08.368 --> 47:09.869
Yes.

47:09.953 --> 47:12.455
Beheading, hanging.

47:12.539 --> 47:14.624
And sometimes
they're only teenagers.

47:16.209 --> 47:19.295
I knew I couldn't find love
if I stayed there.

47:19.379 --> 47:21.172
If I did, I could die for it,

47:21.256 --> 47:24.217
but, uh, I did not want
my life to be this way.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.073
Hey.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.451
You know he can't
hurt you anymore.

47:51.828 --> 47:53.371
It's not him.

47:55.748 --> 47:56.833
It's Sam.

47:58.710 --> 48:00.587
Come, let's have some ice cream.

48:03.590 --> 48:04.674
I'm good.

48:08.636 --> 48:12.265
My dad used to take us
for ice cream every Saturday,

48:12.348 --> 48:13.558
even if we misbehaved.

48:16.144 --> 48:19.731
What's your favorite flavor?
Rosewater with cream chips.

48:19.814 --> 48:22.567
It's delicious.
Sounds like soap.

48:22.650 --> 48:24.819
No, it doesn't. No.
It does.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.071
Arabic ice cream
is very different.

48:27.155 --> 48:29.449
It's thicker
and chewier, you know,

48:29.532 --> 48:30.992
because of the mastic
that they put...

49:00.188 --> 49:01.356
Oh, we're here.

49:03.066 --> 49:05.818
"Welcome to Creekville."

49:08.655 --> 49:10.990
Hm.

49:11.074 --> 49:12.492
Where's the creek?

49:14.369 --> 49:18.081
You any kin to old Mac
Bledsoe who just died?

49:18.164 --> 49:21.000
I'm his son.
Mike?

49:21.084 --> 49:23.836
You don't even
look like yourself anymore.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.755
I'm Frank, the oldest.

49:26.964 --> 49:28.091
Oh.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.678
You're the one who
runned off to New York.

49:31.761 --> 49:33.137
That's the one.

49:37.809 --> 49:39.310
There's your keys.

49:43.064 --> 49:44.524
Look at me.

49:49.862 --> 49:51.322
Thank you.

50:07.922 --> 50:10.842
You need to wait ten minutes
before checking in.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.343
Yeah, I know the drill.

50:12.427 --> 50:14.554
No, Wally.
Ten minutes... I mean it.

50:14.637 --> 50:15.888
It's different down here.

50:15.972 --> 50:17.765
Okay, sweetheart. Okay.

50:17.849 --> 50:21.269
That old fart will call the
police. They will put us in jail.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.855
I got to get ready to go
to the funeral parlor.

50:34.866 --> 50:36.868
I thought we were
going to the funeral home.

50:41.873 --> 50:43.249
I'll be two seconds.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.288
You want one?

51:24.957 --> 51:26.209
No, thank you.

51:42.308 --> 51:45.853
Do not tell Wally I'm
drinking.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.551
Betty.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.135
Oh, Betty.

52:18.219 --> 52:19.470
Beth.

52:19.554 --> 52:21.556
Right.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.891
I was so worried
you two got in a...

52:23.975 --> 52:25.852
Oh. Oh.
Hey, Kitty.

52:25.935 --> 52:27.728
I thought you got in a wreck
and were laying dead

52:27.812 --> 52:28.896
in a ditch somewhere.

52:28.980 --> 52:31.607
Thank you for driving her.

52:31.691 --> 52:33.860
I couldn't have her on
a plane. I just couldn't.

52:33.943 --> 52:35.319
I know.

52:35.403 --> 52:38.406
My stepdad's cousin's son
died in a plane crash.

52:39.866 --> 52:41.325
You might remember that.
I get it.

52:41.409 --> 52:43.119
It happens to real people.

52:43.202 --> 52:45.788
I... I'm...
Yeah, okay.

52:45.872 --> 52:47.164
I'm sorry about your daddy.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.833
Mama.

52:50.042 --> 52:52.086
Frank!
Oh, Mama.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.963
Oh, it's so good you're here.

52:54.046 --> 52:56.424
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.217
No warning.

52:58.301 --> 53:00.928
You know, he just dropped
dead right in front of me,

53:01.012 --> 53:02.305
getting into the car.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.849
We was about to go
to the Food Lion.

53:04.932 --> 53:08.769
Oh, Mama, it's all right.

53:08.853 --> 53:11.939
It's okay. It's okay.

53:12.023 --> 53:15.234
Oh, Frank, Frank, Frank.

53:15.318 --> 53:17.236
He loved you.
Mm-hm.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.196
No, he did, he did, he did. Mm.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.865
He did. He loved you.

53:20.948 --> 53:23.868
You want...
You want to see him?

53:23.951 --> 53:26.245
Yeah. He looks real
good. Real good.

53:46.641 --> 53:47.934
Hey, big brother.

53:48.017 --> 53:50.061
Oh, hey, Mike.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.396
He's the best friend
I'll ever have.

53:54.065 --> 53:56.400
Really?
Mm-hm. Yeah.

53:58.444 --> 54:01.030
I only asked him to be
best man in my wedding

54:01.113 --> 54:03.741
'cause I was scared not to.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.748
After the rehearsal dinner,
we got shit-faced.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.877
Goddamn, he was like
another man.

54:14.961 --> 54:18.089
He was, like, funny.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.925
Told me how, uh, he felt like

54:21.008 --> 54:23.928
he was never good enough
for Mama.

54:24.011 --> 54:25.429
He told me how he thought

54:25.513 --> 54:26.931
Kitty wasn't good enough for me,

54:27.014 --> 54:28.683
which he was wrong about.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.312
We were both hung over
at the wedding.

54:33.396 --> 54:34.689
You didn't notice?

54:34.772 --> 54:36.857
Uh-uh.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.859
I just thought
you seemed nervous.

54:41.487 --> 54:43.280
I was shaking like
an old hound dog

54:43.364 --> 54:44.865
trying to shit out a peach pit.

54:44.949 --> 54:46.283
Oh.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.124
You know,
I've been driving up here

54:53.207 --> 54:56.085
once a week
for more than 20 years...

54:57.420 --> 54:59.463
just to have breakfast
with Daddy.

55:09.390 --> 55:12.643
He'd ask if
I had heard from you.

55:14.395 --> 55:16.188
Course, I hadn't.

55:16.272 --> 55:19.525
But I never kept in touch
much with you, neither.

55:19.608 --> 55:21.652
Well, it's...
Hey.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.740
And for that...

55:31.078 --> 55:32.955
I...

55:33.039 --> 55:35.207
I'm sorry.

55:37.001 --> 55:40.880
You don't need to be sorry.
It's okay.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.265
Hello?

55:51.348 --> 55:53.142
Hello?

55:53.225 --> 55:54.351
Hello.

55:54.435 --> 55:55.603
Mom?

56:25.174 --> 56:26.884
It just
doesn't make any sense.

56:26.967 --> 56:29.470
Betty wants to stay
in a motel all by herself

56:29.553 --> 56:32.014
instead of sleeping at home
in her own bed.

56:32.098 --> 56:34.558
It's Beth,
and I'm not by myself.

56:34.642 --> 56:38.062
Uncle Frank is staying
there, too. So is Wally.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.605
Who's Wally?

56:40.815 --> 56:42.817
He's a man that we met.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.276
Me and Uncle Frank.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.945
He's staying at the motel, too.

56:48.781 --> 56:50.449
Well, that doesn't sound right.

56:50.533 --> 56:54.537
No, ma'am, that sounds
wronger than wrong.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.247
How old are you, Betty?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.999
It's...
I'm 18, and it's Beth.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.919
18, and you want to stay
by yourself in a motel?

57:02.002 --> 57:04.964
Aren't you... Aren't you
concerned about your reputation?

57:05.047 --> 57:07.258
My reputation with whom?

57:07.341 --> 57:09.176
Men care about things like that.

57:09.260 --> 57:12.054
Trust me,
I know from experience.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.808
It's almost 9:00.
We should be headed back.

57:15.891 --> 57:18.227
Frank, I don't understand
why Betty has...

57:18.310 --> 57:20.146
Beth has to stay in a motel

57:20.229 --> 57:22.106
when she can sleep
at home in her own bed.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.691
It's a waste of money.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.485
Well, I'm not sure that's
your decision to make, Kitty,

57:26.569 --> 57:28.779
because Beth is an adult now

57:28.863 --> 57:31.282
and she gets to make up
her own mind.

57:33.576 --> 57:36.662
It's only my second time
in a motel, Mama.

57:36.745 --> 57:38.372
It's fun.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.838
Well, I hope it's clean,
at least.

57:45.921 --> 57:48.340
Frank, who is Wally?

57:52.094 --> 57:55.097
I told them about the man
we met at the motel,

57:55.181 --> 57:56.640
with the Winnebago.

57:56.724 --> 57:59.143
Oh, the guy with the dog?
Yeah.

58:00.728 --> 58:03.314
They're traveling
across America.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.399
He's so cute, Mama.

58:05.482 --> 58:08.068
Smartest dog I ever met.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.154
You got to be careful
about strange dogs, you know.

58:10.237 --> 58:11.405
They can bite you.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.781
He's blind.

58:14.617 --> 58:17.244
The dog, not the driver.

58:55.616 --> 58:56.700
Good night.

59:13.592 --> 59:16.220
Frank. Frank.

59:23.394 --> 59:26.522
I can smell the alcohol.

59:27.898 --> 59:30.609
Look, if ever I had a reason
to drink, this would be it.

59:30.693 --> 59:31.986
Bullshit.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.404
Can you just stop?

59:34.780 --> 59:37.241
I can't take it from you,
Wally. Not right now.

59:37.324 --> 59:38.993
At least wait till
this whole thing is over.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.412
Can you do that for me?
Would that be okay with you?

59:41.495 --> 59:44.164
Could you do it for me?

59:44.248 --> 59:47.960
I won't go through it
again. I won't.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.269
I'll be up if you need to talk.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:06.895
Good night.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.862
Mac Bledsoe was the kind of man

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.406
you don't see much anymore.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.366
Dedicated husband.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.993
Loving father.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.038
Good American.
Good Christian.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:29.835
A man for whom
doing the right thing,

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.462
it wasn't a choice.

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:34.715
It was his duty.

01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:38.510
It was his duty
to teach his children

01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:40.763
the difference
between right and wrong.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.351
And now it's our duty.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.646
It's our duty to walk...

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:54.193
in the same path
of righteousness as Mac.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:57.446
I don't want you
seeing that Lassiter boy again.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:04.078
If I find out you are,
I'll kill you both.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:12.336
You're gambling
with your very soul, son.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:15.923
Opening yourself up
to that sickness.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.010
You want to be a queer, hm?

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.388
A faggot?

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.226
It's perversion.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:31.605
God hisself will turn
his back on you.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:35.818
Cast you into the lake of fire.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:55.045
It's what
God expected of Mac,

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:58.966
and it's what God
now expects of us.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.806
Let us pray.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.228
Our Father...

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.480
who art in Heaven,

01:02:13.564 --> 01:02:16.567
hallowed be thy name.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.362
Thy kingdom come.

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.406
Thy will be done...

01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:27.161
...on Earth
as it is in Heaven.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.330
Oh, my God.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.710
Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.629
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:41.341
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:46.722
Lead us not into temptation,

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.100
but deliver us from evil.

01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:52.728
For thine is the kingdom

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:56.732
and the power and the glory,

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.525
forever and ever.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.034
Amen.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.685
Mm. Everyone
up there talk like a Yankee?

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.562
Not everybody.
Mm, mm!

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:18.313
You see any famous people
in New York?

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:21.775
Yes. Truman Capote.
Truman who?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.527
Oh, I think I saw Rhoda's mom

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.237
from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.613
Oh!

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.282
So, what about you?

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.825
How's life?
Mm.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.160
Honestly, Beth,
I've never been happier.

01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:34.454
That's great, Marsha.
Yeah.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.457
I love being a mother.
I love being pregnant.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.001
I love Travis more every day.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.544
He's a really good daddy.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.422
Uh, Travis?
Mm. Mm-hm.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:46.300
He don't go by Tee Dub no more
now that he's a business owner.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:47.551
Yeah.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:51.930
But, oh, we still
get it on all the time.

01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:55.267
He is very blessed

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.019
in that department.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.937
That's nice.

01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:00.105
What's wrong, monkey?

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.940
You want to wear Mama's shoes?

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.992
He loves to do that.
I have no idea why.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.454
So, how's Wally?

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.831
He's good.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.958
I think he should
be here with you.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:23.545
He is here.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.130
He's at the motel.

01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:27.966
Well, go get him.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.843
Get him?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.055
I want to meet him.
After all these years.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.140
At Dad's funeral?

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.391
"Excuse me, everyone.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:39.770
I have an announcement
to make."

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:43.607
Frank, it is 1973.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.902
And I know Beau
would be okay with it,

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.029
and Kitty, probably.

01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:53.742
Mike, that's a question mark.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:55.619
No shit.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:56.828
You want one?

01:05:56.912 --> 01:05:58.830
No, thank you.
You sure?

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:00.874
I'm sure.
Mm.

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.797
It's just for this.
I swear.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.423
You want to pinkie-promise me?

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:09.841
Pinkie promise.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.429
What kind of wake
doesn't have a bar?

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.182
One in this town.

01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:24.648
I'm just waiting
for Aunt Butch to ask me,

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.526
"Is there any news
on the female front?"

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:32.948
She has a spider in her hair.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:36.451
She what?
Yeah.

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:38.954
I shared a car with her
to the cemetery, and I...

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.164
I thought I saw something
moving in there.

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:43.291
I looked closer,
and it was a spider.

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.045
Did you tell her?

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:49.339
You didn't?

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.093
Oh, I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.554
I mean, remember how mad she got

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.639
when I told her
her wig was on backwards

01:06:57.723 --> 01:07:00.600
and she'd just been in
church all day?

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:03.186
That's why she stopped
wearing wigs.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:05.105
Well...

01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:08.900
My baby. My baby boy.

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:10.026
Mm-hm.

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:19.786
Well, hey there, Frank.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.080
I've been looking for you.

01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:24.958
Aunt Butch, don't you look
pretty today.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:30.505
Tell me, any news
on the female front?

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:32.257
Nope.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.925
Well, how old are you?

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:35.343
You must be getting on up there.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:37.012
I'm... I'm 46.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:38.847
Well, you got to
get moving, boy.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.808
You're gonna
end up like me. Oh.

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:44.060
Course, it's different for men.

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:51.234
Hey.

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:53.445
Y'all need to come in the house.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:54.738
Is anything wrong?

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.948
No. The lawyer's here.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.246
I realize this is
unorthodox timing

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:07.292
and a rather unusual venue
for the reading of the will,

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.586
but Mac wanted to make sure
that it happened

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:12.047
while all his kids
were still here.

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:21.055
All right, then.

01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:25.060
"I, Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe,
being of sound mind and body,

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.854
do hereby declare this to be
my last will and testament.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:32.526
First, to my wife
Evelyn Caldwell Bledsoe,

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.819
I leave the whole
of my estate and assets,

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:39.198
with the exception of the
following designated amounts.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:41.368
To my son,
Michael James Bledsoe,

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.246
and to my daughter,
Neva Mae Bledsoe Henderson,

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:47.249
"I leave the sum
of $25,000 each."

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.920
To my sister,
Florence Vivian Bledsoe,

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:54.171
I leave the sum of $500.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.930
To my oldest son,

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:04.515
Francis MacKenzie Bledsoe, Jr...

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:09.979
I leave nothing but
disgust with the filthy

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:13.692
and unnatural perversion
he engages in with other men,

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:17.153
"and shame that he carries
my name."

01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:23.410
What?

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:31.042
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:32.210
Frank.

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:34.837
I'm so sorry, Frank.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.881
I'm so sorry.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.675
I'm so sorry.

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:41.928
Frank, please don't go.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.014
Please don't go.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.682
Frank!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.393
He's never gonna come back.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.853
Jesus.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.908
How's life?

01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:05.744
Life sucks, Beth.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:09.039
I'm 22, I work at the bakery
at the goddamn Food Lion,

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.875
and I still live at home
with Mama and Daddy.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:15.003
Oh, my Lord, y'all are not
gonna believe what just happened.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.519
Daddy, I need
to borrow your car.

01:10:31.603 --> 01:10:33.313
Daddy, it's an emergency!

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.814
Wait, what kind of emergency?

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.691
Just give me the goddamn keys!

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.274
Frank.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:29.953
Is Uncle Frank here?

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:31.871
Isn't he at the wake?
No, he left.

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.499
Everybody knows he's gay now.
Daddy Mac put it in his will.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:36.334
But Uncle Frank got in
the car and drove away.

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:39.129
Was he drunk?
Was he drunk?

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.131
I think so.
Oh, my God.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.924
Why would he drive drunk?

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.314
Stay right there.

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:04.946
We can't ever
do that stuff again.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.783
Frank.
We have to stop now...

01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:13.830
if we want any chance to be
normal and not end up perverts.

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:21.254
Do you want to be a faggot?

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.797
A queer?

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.679
Do you want to go to hell?

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.682
'Cause it's a sickness!

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:36.269
And God hates it.

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:47.197
Don't ever come near me...

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.074
or talk to me again.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:52.971
Why do you think
he's at the lake?

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.764
'Cause I know
what happened there, Beth.

01:13:54.848 --> 01:13:56.933
I know how Frank is
when he gets drunk.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.227
There should be a gate
up here on the left.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.574
Fuck.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.368
This way.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.481
Maybe he went for a swim?

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:52.947
He'd never take these off.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.918
Frank!

01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:17.388
Fuck! Fuck!

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.110
Why are you in my room?

01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:34.030
Frank?

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.117
You fucking idiot of a
moron! What? What?

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:39.994
Do you know what
you just put me through?

01:15:40.078 --> 01:15:42.372
I just went for a swim.
I couldn't find my car.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:45.250
Jesus. Wake up...
the fuck up, Frank!

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.461
You're not the only one something bad
happened to. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.463
There are
people who love you.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.173
Yeah, well,
people are idiots.

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:53.841
Fuck.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.388
Oh, you motherfucker.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.265
Fine.

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:02.308
Go ahead, destroy yourself.

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:03.977
Destroy us.
Us?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.436
What the fuck is us?
I hate us.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.813
We're freaks. Cheers.

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:12.277
Uncle Frank, don't!

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.778
He's just trying to help you.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:15.947
- Stop it!
- Fuck you!

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.156
Stop it!
Get off me!

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.367
Fucker!
Stop it!

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.911
Fuck you!
Frank!

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:24.122
You motherfucker!
You faggot!

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.623
You pussy!

01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:27.208
Faggot!

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.429
Frank, it's okay.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.014
Stop!

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.952
Wally, aren't you
going to follow him?

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:30.480
Couldn't even say it
to my face, could you?

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.939
Coward.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:14.607
What did I do?

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.214
Oh, God! Oh, God.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.569
Sam.

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:05.783
Forgive me.

01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:09.871
Forgive me.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:22.758
Oh, Samuel.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.929
Sam.

01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.306
Frank.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.279
I have no family.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:46.032
You have me.

01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:54.582
I'm your family,
and you're mine.

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.084
Till death.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:07.553
You know it, I know it,
and God knows it.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:09.597
And that's all that matters.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.188
I'm sorry.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.780
You should be.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.463
Mama made me promise if I
found you, I'd bring you back.

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.133
I don't want to see them, Beth.

01:20:50.972 --> 01:20:53.474
But, so years ago,
when you told me

01:20:53.558 --> 01:20:55.309
I should be what I want to be,

01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:59.313
not what other people want me
to be, that was just bullshit?

01:21:03.818 --> 01:21:06.279
You know, that conversation
changed my life.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.908
Now I find out
you can't be who you are

01:21:10.992 --> 01:21:13.452
unless nobody around you
disagrees with it.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.136
I thought you, uh...

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.513
you might want this back.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:48.070
You want to go meet
my fucking family?

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:54.076
Yeah.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.413
If you take a
shower first.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:01.083
Ugh, Frank, it's like
the sewers of Sri Lanka.

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:03.002
Geez.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.307
At least she didn't
crash the car.

01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:24.565
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:34.450
Hey, Mike.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:35.951
Frank.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.921
I got two words for you.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.759
No problem.

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:04.689
You're my big brother.

01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.857
Whatever you are, no problem.

01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:13.739
Hey, Mike, uh...

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:16.075
this is Walid.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:18.119
Hey, man. Call me Wally.
Okay.

01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:21.205
No problem.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:38.264
Thank you, Kitty.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:39.974
I have to tell you something.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:42.101
This makes me like you
even more.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.019
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.105
My hairdresser is gay.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:49.275
Oh. He is the most hilarious
person in the whole world.

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.193
I really want to
introduce you to him.

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:54.905
We have so much in
common, probably. Yes!

01:23:54.989 --> 01:23:57.032
Wally, this is
my sister-in-law, Kitty.

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.826
I love
your name. Yeah.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.913
Aw. Mm.

01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:05.082
Oh.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:07.752
Okay.

01:24:07.835 --> 01:24:09.044
Aw.

01:24:09.128 --> 01:24:12.423
Oh, God, you smell so good!

01:24:13.424 --> 01:24:15.676
Do you all smell good?

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.303
Yes.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.138
Come with me. Come on.

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:23.184
I am so proud of you.

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:25.978
And this must be Wally.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.063
Neva.
Oh!

01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:30.441
You're exactly how
I imagined you.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:33.319
Oh, I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.529
Me, too.
Welcome.

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:38.783
This is Beau. Hey, Beau.

01:24:38.866 --> 01:24:39.784
Frank.

01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:42.453
And, uh, Wally.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:43.788
Right?
Beau.

01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:46.707
Um...

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:49.919
If y'all could, uh,
excuse me for a minute.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.298
Um...
It's okay.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:56.675
It's okay.

01:24:56.759 --> 01:25:00.721
You know, when I was
a little girl in Jacksonboro,

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:02.640
there was a man in town.

01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:04.558
He was a dance teacher.

01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:07.186
He was some kind of
a dago or Mexican.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.313
Oh.
He had a name

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:15.528
like Carlos or Antonio, but
everybody called him "the tissy pretzel."

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:19.281
And he was a
backwards bobby like you.

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.283
You're not the only one.

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:26.831
I hear Charleston is just
crawling with them these days.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.044
You're all going to hell,
you know?

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.217
Aunt Butch.

01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:42.763
I know...

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:47.226
that that is the very best
that you're capable of.

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:52.189
Frank!

01:26:03.117 --> 01:26:04.743
Frank.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:11.166
You are my precious
gift from God...

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.835
and nothing...

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:21.218
nothing will ever change that.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:35.107
It's okay.

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:38.193
Oh, baby.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.950
Your daddy was scared of it.

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:48.162
Always was.

01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:55.002
You remember how much he
hated your Great-Uncle Jasper?

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.089
Uncle Jasper was...?

01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:01.592
Uh-huh. He was.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:08.724
I figured that's probably
why you were.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.101
I mean, if being
curly-headed is something

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:13.520
that gets passed down,
why not...

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.816
You knew?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.985
Mothers know.

01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:28.702
Oh, well...

01:27:30.037 --> 01:27:31.372
Who's this?

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:36.168
Come here. Come here.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.965
Come here. Come here.

01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:43.634
Mama, this is...
this is Wally.

01:27:45.803 --> 01:27:48.847
I've wanted to meet you
for so long, Mrs. Bledsoe.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:51.725
And... and I'm so sorry
for your loss.

01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:53.435
Thank you.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.314
Well, he has as much hair
on his face

01:27:57.398 --> 01:27:59.400
as he does on his head,
doesn't he?

01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:07.116
I've got you something.
Mm.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:09.076
A little gift
from New York City.

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:10.536
Oh...

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:16.333
How pretty.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.589
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Wally.

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:24.091
Nice meeting you, too, ma'am.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:25.843
And please call me Mammaw.

01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.470
Mammaw.

01:28:28.554 --> 01:28:31.473
You... You should go on
and sit down now.

01:28:31.557 --> 01:28:34.101
Honey, go. Run.
Get out.

01:28:40.107 --> 01:28:41.900
You can sit down now.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:46.196
He is my brother.
That doesn't make it right.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.198
It isn't wrong.

01:28:48.282 --> 01:28:49.491
Well...

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:51.410
The Bible says it's a sin.

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:55.289
The Bible also says
that it's okay to have slaves.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.374
And okay to, like, marry ten...

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.710
Oh, so what, you don't
believe in the Bible no more?

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:04.298
How you doing?
Good.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.008
How about you?
I'm good.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.261
What I remember
most about

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.513
my Granddaddy Mac's funeral is

01:29:11.597 --> 01:29:14.933
just sitting around the backyard

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:16.643
after everybody else had left.

01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:19.563
And it was just us.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:29.031
The sun was starting to go down.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.407
There was a breeze.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.953
And I remember thinking...

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.872
this is where I belong.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.501
Not like I belonged
with my family.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:42.961
It was bigger than that.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:46.215
Like every single one of us
belonged there,

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.342
in that backyard,

01:29:48.425 --> 01:29:51.011
on that afternoon.

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.222
And I realized in that moment...

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.392
we were all exactly where
we were supposed to be.
