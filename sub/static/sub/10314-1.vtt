01:44.387 --> 01:47.618
- It's 2 o'clock in the morning.
- Oh, George!

01:47.824 --> 01:49.121
Well, it is.

01:51.127 --> 01:52.287
What a cluck you are!

01:53.296 --> 01:54.957
It's late, you know. It's late.

04:16.606 --> 04:18.096
What a dump!

04:20.442 --> 04:23.606
Hey, what's that from? “What a dump! “

04:24.447 --> 04:25.778
How would I know?

04:26.282 --> 04:28.944
Oh, come on, what's it from?
You know!

04:31.621 --> 04:34.283
What's it from, for Christ's sake?

04:34.624 --> 04:36.114
What's what from?

04:36.960 --> 04:39.952
I just told you. I just did it.

04:40.296 --> 04:42.287
“What a dump! “

04:43.299 --> 04:45.290
Huh? What's that from?

04:45.635 --> 04:47.466
I haven't the faintest idea.

04:48.137 --> 04:49.331
Dumbbell!

04:50.073 --> 04:52.132
It's from some Bette Davis picture...

04:52.475 --> 04:54.466
...some goddamn Warner Brothers epic.

04:54.811 --> 04:58.804
Martha, I can't remember all the films
that came out of Warner Brothers.

04:59.148 --> 05:02.140
Nobody's asking you to remember
every Warner Brothers epic.

05:02.485 --> 05:04.646
Just one single little epic.
That's all.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.820
Bette Davis gets peritonitis at the end.

05:08.157 --> 05:10.819
And she wears a fright wig
throughout the picture.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.321
She's married to Joseph Cotten
or something.

05:13.663 --> 05:14.652
Somebody.

05:16.499 --> 05:20.333
She wants to go to Chicago because
she loves that actor with the scar.

05:21.004 --> 05:22.096
She gets sick...

05:22.338 --> 05:24.499
...and sits down at her dressing table...

05:24.841 --> 05:26.331
What actor? What scar?

05:26.676 --> 05:29.509
I can't remember his name!
What's the picture?

05:29.846 --> 05:31.837
I want to know the name of the picture.

05:33.349 --> 05:35.681
She gets this peritonitis...

05:36.686 --> 05:39.849
...and decides to go to Chicago anyway.

05:40.523 --> 05:42.514
“Chicago”! It's called “Chicago.”

05:45.294 --> 05:46.352
What is?

05:47.864 --> 05:49.764
I mean the picture. It's “Chicago.”

05:50.533 --> 05:52.524
Oh, good grief!

05:53.536 --> 05:55.197
Don't you know anything?

05:56.039 --> 05:58.701
“Chicago” was a '30s musical...

05:59.042 --> 06:02.534
...starring little Miss Alice Faye.
Don't you know anything?

06:03.880 --> 06:04.869
This picture...

06:05.715 --> 06:09.378
...Bette Davis comes home from
a hard day at the grocery store...

06:09.719 --> 06:11.380
She works in a grocery store?

06:12.722 --> 06:15.384
She's a housewife. She buys things.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.050
She comes with the groceries...

06:19.729 --> 06:22.391
...and she walks into
the modest living room...

06:22.732 --> 06:26.566
...of the modest cottage
modest Joseph Cotten set her up in.

06:26.903 --> 06:27.733
Are they married?

06:28.905 --> 06:31.738
Yes, they're married.
To each other, cluck!

06:32.575 --> 06:37.239
And she comes in
and she looks around this room...

06:38.915 --> 06:41.076
...and she sets down her groceries.

06:41.751 --> 06:42.911
And she says...

06:44.087 --> 06:45.918
...”What a dump! “

06:52.261 --> 06:53.751
She's discontent.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.423
What's the name of the picture?

06:59.268 --> 07:00.758
I really don't know.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.435
Well, think!

07:02.772 --> 07:03.761
I'm tired, dear.

07:04.107 --> 07:07.440
I don't know why you're tired.
You didn't do anything today.

07:07.777 --> 07:09.574
- I'm tired.
- You didn't have classes.

07:09.779 --> 07:13.613
If your father didn't always set up
these Saturday night orgies...

07:13.950 --> 07:15.781
Well, it's just too bad about you.

07:16.119 --> 07:17.780
Well, that's how it is anyway.

07:18.121 --> 07:22.455
You didn't do anything. You never do.
You never mix!

07:22.792 --> 07:24.453
You just sit around and talk.

07:25.294 --> 07:29.287
What do you want me to do?
Bray at everyone all night like you do?

07:29.632 --> 07:31.293
I don't bray!

07:31.634 --> 07:33.625
All right, you don't bray.

07:34.637 --> 07:36.127
I did not bray.

07:36.472 --> 07:37.962
I said you didn't bray!

07:40.143 --> 07:41.132
Fix me a drink.

07:42.645 --> 07:43.805
Haven't you had enough?

07:44.480 --> 07:46.812
I said fix me a drink!

07:49.152 --> 07:52.815
Well, I don't suppose a nightcap
would kill either of us.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.981
A nightcap? Are you kidding?

07:57.660 --> 07:58.786
We've got guests.

08:01.097 --> 08:01.756
Got what?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.991
Guests. Guests!

08:09.338 --> 08:13.331
Yeah, guests. People.
We've got guests coming over.

08:14.010 --> 08:14.874
When?

08:15.878 --> 08:16.867
Now.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.179
Good Lord, Martha,
do you know what time it is?

08:22.018 --> 08:23.349
Who's coming over?

08:23.686 --> 08:25.779
- What's-their-name.
- Who?

08:27.423 --> 08:29.152
Who's what's-their-name?

08:30.359 --> 08:33.192
I don't know their name, George.

08:33.529 --> 08:38.193
We met tonight. They're new. He's
in the math department or something.

08:38.534 --> 08:41.025
I don't remember
meeting anybody tonight.

08:41.236 --> 08:42.828
Well, you did.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.872
Of all the asinine...
Who are these people?

08:46.209 --> 08:49.042
He's in the Math Department.

08:49.245 --> 08:50.109
Who?

08:50.546 --> 08:55.210
He's in the Math Department.
He's young and he's blond...

08:55.885 --> 08:57.546
He's good-looking, well-built?

08:57.887 --> 09:00.378
Yes, good-looking, well-built.

09:01.724 --> 09:03.715
- It figures.
- What?

09:03.926 --> 09:05.052
Nothing.

09:05.561 --> 09:09.053
His wife's a mousy little type
without any hips or anything.

09:10.399 --> 09:11.388
Remember them now?

09:11.901 --> 09:14.734
I guess so. But why do they
have to come over now?

09:15.071 --> 09:18.040
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them, that's why.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.376
- Daddy said we should be nice to them.
- Why now...?

09:21.577 --> 09:24.239
Because Daddy said
we should be nice to them!

09:24.580 --> 09:28.072
He didn't mean we were supposed
to stay up all night with them.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.408
We could have them over
some Sunday.

09:30.753 --> 09:33.085
Well, never mind.
Besides, it is Sunday.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.088
Very early Sunday.

09:36.926 --> 09:39.520
- It's ridiculous!
- Well, it's done.

10:05.788 --> 10:08.951
Where are they?
If we've got guests, where are they?

10:09.292 --> 10:10.782
They'll be here soon.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.425
What'd they do, go home
and get some sleep first?

10:14.297 --> 10:16.288
They'll be here.

10:16.499 --> 10:17.864
I wish you'd tell me...

10:18.100 --> 10:21.160
...about things. Stop springing
things on me all the time.

10:21.637 --> 10:24.333
I don't spring things
on you all the time.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.303
You really do! You're always
springing things on me.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.442
Always.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.114
Poor Georgie Porgie put-upon-pie.

10:41.791 --> 10:44.954
What are you doing? Are you sulking?

10:46.462 --> 10:49.954
Let me see. Are you sulking?

10:50.299 --> 10:52.631
Is that what you're doing?

10:53.302 --> 10:54.633
Never mind.

10:57.473 --> 10:58.963
Just don't bother yourself.

11:07.983 --> 11:12.647
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf?

11:19.495 --> 11:22.987
What's wrong? Didn't think it's funny?
I thought it was a scream.

11:23.332 --> 11:24.492
It was all right.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.995
You laughed when you heard it
at the party.

11:27.336 --> 11:28.826
I smiled. I didn't laugh.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.503
You laughed your goddamn head off!

11:31.841 --> 11:32.671
It was all right.

11:33.008 --> 11:34.669
It was a scream.

11:35.010 --> 11:37.843
It was very funny, yes.

11:38.714 --> 11:40.272
You make me puke.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.682
You make me puke.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.448
Wasn't a very nice thing to say.

11:46.856 --> 11:48.346
That wasn't what?

11:48.691 --> 11:50.522
A very nice thing to say.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.521
Oh, I like your anger.

11:53.028 --> 11:56.361
I think that's what I like
about you most.

11:56.699 --> 11:58.030
Your anger.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.605
You are such a simp!

12:03.906 --> 12:05.703
You haven't got...

12:07.877 --> 12:09.139
...the what?

12:10.913 --> 12:11.675
Guts?

12:13.716 --> 12:15.047
Phrase-maker.

12:36.772 --> 12:39.741
You never put any ice in my drink.
Why is that?

12:40.743 --> 12:43.735
I always put ice in your drinks.
You eat it, that's all.

12:44.079 --> 12:48.573
It's this habit you've got of chewing
on your ice cubes like a cocker spaniel.

12:50.753 --> 12:52.243
You'll crack your big teeth.

12:53.422 --> 12:55.253
Well, they're my big teeth.

12:55.758 --> 12:57.419
Yeah, some of them, some of them.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.751
I've got more teeth than you have.

13:00.095 --> 13:01.255
Two more.

13:03.766 --> 13:05.597
And you're going bald.

13:06.602 --> 13:07.432
So are you.

13:26.121 --> 13:27.110
Hello, honey.

13:30.793 --> 13:34.126
Come on and give your mommy
a big sloppy kiss.

13:35.631 --> 13:38.293
I want a big sloppy kiss!

13:38.634 --> 13:40.431
I don't want to kiss you right now.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.796
Where are these people you invited?

13:45.140 --> 13:49.804
Where is this good looking, well-built
young man and his slim-hipped wife?

13:50.813 --> 13:52.974
Talking to Daddy. They'll be here.

13:56.151 --> 13:57.641
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.729
Why didn't you want to kiss me?

14:13.168 --> 14:17.161
If I kissed you I'd get all excited.
I'd get beside myself...

14:17.506 --> 14:20.839
...and then I'd have to take you by
force on the living room rug.

14:21.176 --> 14:25.670
Then our guests would walk in and
what would your father say about that?

14:26.181 --> 14:27.842
Oh, you pig!

14:30.185 --> 14:32.517
Fix me another drink, lover.

14:33.188 --> 14:35.486
God, you can swill it down, can't you?

14:35.691 --> 14:37.181
I'm thirsty!

14:37.526 --> 14:38.515
Oh, Jesus!

14:38.861 --> 14:42.854
I can drink you under any table you
want, so don't worry about me.

14:43.198 --> 14:47.862
You got the prize years ago.
You've won every abomination award.

14:49.038 --> 14:51.370
I swear if you existed I'd divorce you.

14:51.707 --> 14:54.835
- Stay on your feet for your guests.
- I can't even see you!

14:55.377 --> 14:59.370
If you pass out or throw up...
And try to keep your clothes on too.

14:59.715 --> 15:04.049
There's no more sickening sight than
you drunk and your skirt over your head.

15:04.887 --> 15:06.377
Your heads, I should say.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.717
Party! Party!

15:10.559 --> 15:12.754
I'm really looking forward to this.

15:12.962 --> 15:14.930
- Go answer the door.
- You answer it.

15:15.130 --> 15:16.392
Get to that door, you!

15:17.766 --> 15:18.698
Come on in!

15:18.901 --> 15:20.562
Get over and answer that door.

15:20.903 --> 15:25.067
All right. Whatever love wants.
Just don't start on the bit, that's all.

15:25.407 --> 15:26.965
The bit?

15:27.743 --> 15:30.576
What language is that?
Imitating one of your students?

15:30.913 --> 15:33.905
Don't start in on the bit
about the kid, that's all.

15:34.249 --> 15:36.547
- What do you take me for?
- Much too much.

15:36.752 --> 15:38.743
I'll start in on the kid if I want to.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.248
I'd advise against it.

15:40.589 --> 15:43.752
Well, good for you.
Get over there and open that door.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.253
You've been advised.

15:45.594 --> 15:46.583
Sure. Get over there.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.760
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.259
Some people still have manners...

15:51.600 --> 15:54.262
...and just don't break into
people's houses.

15:54.603 --> 15:58.266
Even if they hear a subhuman monster
yowling at them from inside.

15:58.607 --> 15:59.767
Goddamn you!

16:08.751 --> 16:10.719
You must be our little guests.

16:10.953 --> 16:14.514
Just ignore old sourpuss here.
Come on in, kids!

16:15.124 --> 16:17.957
Just hand your coats to old sourpuss
here.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.791
Perhaps we shouldn't have come.

16:20.129 --> 16:21.619
Yes, it is late!

16:21.964 --> 16:25.798
Late! Are you kidding?
Just throw your stuff down any place.

16:26.135 --> 16:28.968
Furniture, floor.
Makes no difference around here.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.600
I told you we shouldn't have come.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.968
I said come on in. Now come on!

16:36.812 --> 16:38.643
Look, muckmouth, you cut that out!

16:39.815 --> 16:41.976
Martha's a devil with language.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.019
Kids, sit down.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.986
Isn't this lovely?

16:54.163 --> 16:57.064
- Yes, indeed. Very handsome.
- Thank you.

17:12.314 --> 17:13.941
Who did the painting?

17:15.517 --> 17:19.009
Some Greek with a mustache
Martha attacked one night in a...

17:21.957 --> 17:24.016
It's got a...

17:24.526 --> 17:26.493
- Quiet intensity?
- Well, no...

17:26.694 --> 17:29.027
Then a certain
noisy relaxed quality maybe?

17:30.866 --> 17:33.027
How about a quietly
noisy relaxed intensity?

17:33.235 --> 17:35.032
Dear, you're being joshed.

17:35.704 --> 17:36.864
I'm aware of that.

17:37.206 --> 17:38.195
I am sorry.

17:38.540 --> 17:43.034
It's actually a pictorial representation
of the order of Martha's mind.

17:46.548 --> 17:47.674
Fix the kids a drink.

17:47.950 --> 17:49.747
What would you like to drink?

17:52.287 --> 17:53.584
What would you like?

17:54.723 --> 17:57.715
A little brandy maybe.
Never mix, never worry!

17:58.060 --> 18:00.221
Brandy? Just brandy.
Simple, simple.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.029
What about you...

18:05.901 --> 18:07.425
Bourbon, if you don't mind.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.069
Mind? I don't mind.
Don't think I mind.

18:10.405 --> 18:12.236
Martha, rubbing alcohol for you?

18:12.574 --> 18:14.565
Sure. Never mix, never worry!

18:24.920 --> 18:27.753
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

18:30.259 --> 18:33.092
Wasn't that funny? That was so funny!

18:33.729 --> 18:34.559
Yes, it was.

18:34.763 --> 18:36.924
I thought I'd bust a gut!

18:40.102 --> 18:41.933
George didn't think it was funny.

18:42.271 --> 18:45.763
Martha thinks that unless you
bust a gut you're not amused.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.770
Unless you carry on like a hyena
you're not having fun.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.944
I certainly had fun.
It was a wonderful party!

18:52.214 --> 18:56.275
- It certainly was.
- Your father, he is so wonderful!

18:59.288 --> 19:01.449
He's quite a guy, isn't he?

19:01.790 --> 19:03.121
You better believe it.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.948
He's a marvelous man.

19:05.294 --> 19:07.455
I'm not tearing him down.
We know he's a god.

19:07.796 --> 19:09.127
You lay off my father.

19:09.464 --> 19:12.456
When you've had as many
faculty parties as I have...

19:12.801 --> 19:14.132
I rather appreciated it.

19:15.971 --> 19:18.804
I mean aside from enjoying it,
I appreciated it.

19:19.308 --> 19:23.802
Meeting, introducing, how he had us
stay at the Inn till our place is ready.

19:24.546 --> 19:25.774
When I taught in Kansas...

19:26.048 --> 19:27.447
You won't believe it...

19:27.649 --> 19:32.643
...but we had to make our way all by
ourselves. Isn't that right, dear?

19:32.988 --> 19:34.819
We had to make our own way.

19:35.023 --> 19:39.323
I'd have to go up to the wives
in the library or the supermarket...

19:39.661 --> 19:42.152
...and say, “Hello, I am new here.”

19:42.497 --> 19:45.989
“You must be Mrs. So-and-so,
Doctor So-and-so's wife.”

19:46.201 --> 19:48.499
It really wasn't very nice at all.

19:52.374 --> 19:53.864
Daddy knows how to run things.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.041
He's a remarkable man.

19:56.378 --> 19:57.709
You bet your sweet life.

19:58.714 --> 19:59.874
I'll tell you a secret.

20:00.549 --> 20:05.043
There are easier things in this world,
if you teach at the university...

20:05.387 --> 20:07.378
...than being married
to the daughter of...

20:07.723 --> 20:11.386
...the president of that university.
There are easier things.

20:11.727 --> 20:16.687
It's a great opportunity. For some men
it would be the chance of a lifetime.

20:16.899 --> 20:20.391
There are, believe me,
easier things in this world.

20:20.736 --> 20:23.398
Some men would give their right arm
for the chance!

20:23.739 --> 20:28.233
In reality that sacrifice is of a more
private portion of the anatomy.

20:30.579 --> 20:32.240
Could you show me where the...

20:32.748 --> 20:33.578
Are you all right?

20:33.916 --> 20:38.080
Of course, dear. I just want to
put some powder on my nose.

20:38.587 --> 20:40.748
Show her where we keep the euphemism?

20:44.927 --> 20:47.760
I'm sorry. I want to show you
the house anyway.

20:48.463 --> 20:49.896
We'll be back, dear.

20:51.099 --> 20:53.431
Honestly, George, you burn me up!

20:54.036 --> 20:55.003
You really do!

20:57.105 --> 20:59.437
Don't shoot your mouth off
about you-know-what.

21:00.108 --> 21:03.100
I'll talk about
any goddamn thing I want to!

21:03.445 --> 21:04.605
Okay, vanish!

21:04.947 --> 21:07.279
Any goddamn thing I want!

21:37.479 --> 21:38.707
What'll it be?

21:38.981 --> 21:40.471
I'll stick to bourbon.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.151
You're in the Math Department?

21:50.359 --> 21:51.223
No.

21:55.664 --> 21:57.996
Martha said so.
I think that's what she said.

22:05.007 --> 22:06.668
Why'd you decide to be a teacher?

22:08.343 --> 22:11.005
The same things that motivated you,
I imagine.

22:11.346 --> 22:12.677
Oh? What were they?

22:13.849 --> 22:15.840
What were the things that motivated me?

22:16.685 --> 22:18.175
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

22:18.387 --> 22:21.185
You said the things that motivated you
and me were the same.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.854
I said I imagined they were.

22:23.291 --> 22:24.451
Oh, did you?

22:35.904 --> 22:37.132
You like it here?

22:39.207 --> 22:40.367
Yes, it's fine.

22:40.709 --> 22:42.040
I meant the university.

22:43.745 --> 22:46.009
I know. I meant the university.

22:47.049 --> 22:48.880
Well, I like it fine.

23:02.230 --> 23:05.893
You've been here for quite a long time,
haven't you?

23:10.906 --> 23:15.070
Oh, yes. Ever since I married
what's-her-name. Martha.

23:16.244 --> 23:18.735
Even before that. Forever.

23:19.247 --> 23:21.078
Dashed hopes and good intentions.

23:22.084 --> 23:25.076
Good, better, best, bested!

23:27.255 --> 23:29.086
How do you like that for a declension?

23:29.591 --> 23:30.922
You didn't answer my question.

23:31.927 --> 23:36.421
Don't condescend. I asked you
how you liked that declension.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.965
I don't know what to say.

23:40.435 --> 23:41.766
You don't know what to say?

23:42.370 --> 23:45.771
Shall I say it's funny,
so you can say it's sad?

23:45.974 --> 23:50.775
Or shall I say it's sad so you can say
it's funny? You can play that game!

23:51.379 --> 23:53.279
- Very good!
- I think we'll just...

23:53.782 --> 23:56.273
Now, calm down. Just calm down.
All right?

23:56.618 --> 23:57.778
Another drink? Here.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.452
I still have one.
And when my wife comes down...

24:02.124 --> 24:06.788
What I mean is, you and your wife
seem to be having some sort of a...

24:07.462 --> 24:11.125
Martha and I are having nothing.
Martha and I are merely exercising.

24:11.466 --> 24:14.629
We're walking what's left of our wits.
Pay no attention.

24:14.970 --> 24:16.961
Now let's sit down and talk, huh?

24:17.639 --> 24:21.473
It's just I don't like to become
involved in other people's affairs.

24:21.977 --> 24:25.640
You'll get over that. Small college.
Musical beds is the faculty sport.

24:25.981 --> 24:26.811
Sir?

24:27.149 --> 24:29.982
Never mind. I wish you wouldn't go
“sir.” How old are you?

24:30.485 --> 24:31.474
Twenty-eight.

24:31.686 --> 24:32.983
I'm forty-something.

24:34.089 --> 24:36.489
Aren't you surprised?
Don't I look older?

24:38.994 --> 24:40.325
I think you look fine.

24:40.662 --> 24:43.995
I've always been lean. I play handball.
How much do you weigh?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.333
155, 160, something like that?
You play handball?

24:48.670 --> 24:50.535
- Not very well.
- We'll play sometime.

24:50.739 --> 24:55.176
Martha is 108... years old.
She weighs somewhat more than that.

24:55.510 --> 24:56.499
How old is your wife?

24:57.846 --> 24:59.177
She's twenty-six.

24:59.514 --> 25:03.006
Martha is a remarkable woman.
I imagine she weighs around 110.

25:03.351 --> 25:04.340
Your wife weighs...

25:04.686 --> 25:07.177
No, my boy, your wife.
My wife is Martha.

25:07.889 --> 25:09.151
Yes, I know.

25:09.691 --> 25:12.854
If you were married to Martha
you'd know what it means.

25:14.362 --> 25:16.853
If I were married to your wife,
I'd know what that means.

25:21.036 --> 25:24.199
Martha says you are in
the Math Department or something.

25:25.707 --> 25:26.696
No, I'm not.

25:27.042 --> 25:30.205
She's seldom mistaken.
Maybe you should be in it.

25:31.046 --> 25:33.640
I'm a biologist.
I'm in the Biology Department.

25:38.553 --> 25:42.887
You're the one's going to make all
that trouble making everyone the same.

25:43.225 --> 25:46.388
Rearranging the chromozones,
or whatever it is, right?

25:47.562 --> 25:49.393
Not exactly. Chromosomes.

25:49.898 --> 25:51.058
I'm very mistrustful.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.892
You think we learn nothing from history?
I'm in the History Department.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.536
Yes, I know.

25:57.739 --> 26:00.230
Martha tells me I'm in
the History Department...

26:00.575 --> 26:05.069
...as opposed to being the History
Department, in the sense of running it.

26:05.413 --> 26:08.246
I do not run the History Department.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.414
I don't run the Biology Department.

26:10.619 --> 26:12.246
You're twenty-one. Twenty-eight.

26:12.754 --> 26:16.747
Perhaps when you're forty-something
you'll run the History Department.

26:17.592 --> 26:18.923
Biology Department.

26:19.427 --> 26:21.918
I'm really very mistrustful!

26:22.764 --> 26:26.757
I read somewhere that science fiction
is not really fiction at all.

26:27.102 --> 26:31.198
That you rearrange my genes so that
everyone will be like everyone else.

26:31.606 --> 26:34.439
I suspect we shall not have
much music or painting.

26:35.143 --> 26:39.443
But we'll have a civilization of
sublime young men much like yourself.

26:39.781 --> 26:43.945
Cultures and races will vanish.
The ants will take over the world.

26:44.619 --> 26:46.450
Don't know much about science, do you?

26:46.788 --> 26:49.621
I know history.
I know when I'm being threatened.

26:51.793 --> 26:53.954
Your wife doesn't have any hips,
does she?

26:55.964 --> 27:00.298
I'm not hip-happy. I was implying
that your wife is slim-hipped.

27:01.636 --> 27:02.864
Yes, she is.

27:03.471 --> 27:04.460
You got any kids?

27:05.140 --> 27:06.971
No. Not yet. You?

27:07.309 --> 27:08.799
For me to know and you to find out.

27:12.147 --> 27:13.546
No kids, huh?

27:14.449 --> 27:15.143
What's wrong?

27:15.950 --> 27:18.783
Nothing. We wanted to wait
till we're settled.

27:22.324 --> 27:23.985
Think you'll be happy
here at New Carthage?

27:24.659 --> 27:27.992
Well, we hope to stay here.
I don't mean forever.

27:28.496 --> 27:31.659
Don't bandy that about.
The Old Man wouldn't like it.

27:33.335 --> 27:37.499
Martha's father expects his staff
to come here and grow old...

27:37.839 --> 27:40.239
...and fall in the line of service.

27:40.442 --> 27:42.672
One man, a professor of Latin...

27:43.011 --> 27:45.673
...actually fell in the
cafeteria line one lunch.

27:46.014 --> 27:49.506
But the Old Man isn't falling anywhere.
He isn't going to die.

27:50.352 --> 27:51.683
There are rumors...

27:52.020 --> 27:55.683
...which you can't breathe to Martha
for she foams at the mouth...

27:56.191 --> 27:57.681
...that the Old Man, her father...

27:58.026 --> 28:01.189
...is over two hundred years old.

28:01.696 --> 28:04.859
There's an irony there, but I'm not
drunk enough to figure it out.

28:08.536 --> 28:09.525
Damnit!

28:10.205 --> 28:13.538
I wonder what women talk about
when men talk. I must find out.

28:14.209 --> 28:15.870
What do you want?

28:18.213 --> 28:20.044
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

28:20.882 --> 28:22.247
How many kids you having?

28:23.218 --> 28:24.879
I don't know. My wife is...

28:25.220 --> 28:28.053
Slim-hipped.
Well, there's one of you at least.

28:28.390 --> 28:33.054
You must see this house, dear.
This is such a wonderful old house.

28:34.562 --> 28:36.826
For Christ's sake, hang on a minute!

28:37.031 --> 28:38.896
She'll be right down, she's changing.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.225
She's changing? What, her clothes?

28:41.469 --> 28:42.800
- Her dress.
- Why?

28:43.004 --> 28:45.871
I imagine that she wants
to be comfortable.

28:46.074 --> 28:47.735
Oh, she does, does she?

28:48.009 --> 28:49.567
You don't know!

28:51.646 --> 28:54.581
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, dear, perfectly fine.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.740
She wants to be comfortable?

28:57.419 --> 28:58.750
Well, we'll see about that!

28:59.254 --> 29:01.051
I didn't know that you had a son.

29:04.259 --> 29:07.251
- A son. I hadn't known.
- You to know and me to find out, huh?

29:07.595 --> 29:10.257
Tomorrow is his birthday.
He will be sixteen.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.765
She told you?

29:13.868 --> 29:15.495
- She told you about him?
- Yes.

29:16.771 --> 29:18.295
You said she's changing?

29:19.307 --> 29:21.275
- And she mentioned...
- Your son's birthday.

29:26.114 --> 29:27.604
You look pale. Would you like...

29:27.949 --> 29:31.441
Yes, dear a little more brandy maybe.
Just a drop.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.446
The bar?

29:33.922 --> 29:37.790
Yes, by all means, drink away.
You'll need it as years go on.

29:39.294 --> 29:41.125
Damn destructive...

29:41.463 --> 29:42.953
What time is it, dear?

29:44.332 --> 29:46.493
- 2:30.
- So late!

29:46.801 --> 29:47.961
We should get home.

29:48.470 --> 29:49.994
Keeping the baby sitter up?

29:51.806 --> 29:53.296
I said we didn't have children.

29:54.142 --> 29:56.133
Sorry, I wasn't even listening.

29:56.478 --> 29:58.309
Or thinking. Whichever applies.

29:59.147 --> 30:00.273
We'll go in a while.

30:00.648 --> 30:02.138
No, you mustn't!

30:02.550 --> 30:07.647
Martha is changing, and not for me.
Martha hasn't changed for me in years.

30:07.989 --> 30:11.982
It means we're going to be here days.
You're being accorded an honor.

30:12.327 --> 30:16.491
Don't forget Martha is the daughter
of our beloved boss... his right arm.

30:17.165 --> 30:19.827
I'd use another word,
but leave that sort of talk to Martha.

30:20.335 --> 30:21.632
What sort of talk?

30:25.840 --> 30:26.829
Well, now!

30:29.143 --> 30:31.304
Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress!

30:31.646 --> 30:33.978
Oh, that's most attractive!

30:34.315 --> 30:35.646
You like it? Good.

30:37.051 --> 30:39.645
What do you mean screaming
up the stairs at me?

30:39.854 --> 30:42.982
We got lonely for the soft purr
of your little voice.

30:43.658 --> 30:46.491
Well, you just trot over
to the bar-ie-poo...

30:46.828 --> 30:49.820
...and make your little mommy
a great big drink.

30:50.164 --> 30:51.324
That's right!

30:54.769 --> 30:59.172
You're quite a guy, getting your masters
when you were what, 12?

31:00.008 --> 31:02.499
- Hear that, George?
- 12 and a half, actually.

31:03.344 --> 31:04.311
19, really.

31:04.546 --> 31:07.447
- You needn't have mentioned it.
- I'm proud of you!

31:07.649 --> 31:09.913
- I'm very impressed.
- You're damn right!

31:10.118 --> 31:14.020
I'm wracked with jealousy.
What do you want me to do, throw up?

31:15.390 --> 31:18.018
That's very impressive.
You should be proud.

31:18.359 --> 31:20.350
He's a pretty nice fellow.

31:21.029 --> 31:23.190
You might take over
the History Department.

31:23.398 --> 31:24.695
Biology Department.

31:25.366 --> 31:27.027
Yes. I'm preoccupied with history.

31:29.037 --> 31:31.870
What a remark.
“I am preoccupied with history.”

31:34.375 --> 31:38.368
George is not. George is preoccupied
with the History Department.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.871
He's preoccupied with it...

31:41.215 --> 31:45.379
...because he is not the
History Department, he is only in it.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.211
We went through that
while you were upstairs.

31:48.556 --> 31:50.387
That's right, baby, keep it clean.

31:51.225 --> 31:54.058
George is bogged down
in the History Department.

31:55.229 --> 31:57.720
He's an old bog
in the History Department.

31:58.199 --> 31:59.757
That's what George is...

31:59.968 --> 32:03.927
...A bog, a fen, a G.D. Swamp!

32:07.408 --> 32:09.899
Hey, swamp! Hey, swampy!

32:14.916 --> 32:16.076
Can I get you something?

32:18.252 --> 32:19.082
Well, sure.

32:19.554 --> 32:23.251
You can light my cigarette
if you're of a mind to.

32:23.591 --> 32:25.582
No. There are limits.

32:26.427 --> 32:27.917
A man puts up with only so much...

32:28.262 --> 32:31.925
...before he descends on the
evolutionary ladder which is your line.

32:32.767 --> 32:36.601
I'll hold your hand when it's dark
and you're afraid of the bogeyman.

32:36.938 --> 32:39.930
And I'll tote your gin bottles
out after midnight so no one sees.

32:40.274 --> 32:44.608
But I will not light your cigarette.
And that, as they say, is that.

32:50.752 --> 32:52.947
Hey, you played football, huh?

32:53.287 --> 32:55.118
Yes, I was a quarterback.

32:55.356 --> 32:57.790
But I was much more adept at boxing.

32:58.626 --> 33:01.288
Boxing? You hear that, George?

33:02.797 --> 33:05.891
Must've been good. Doesn't look
like you got hit in the face.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.133
He was intercollegiate state
middleweight champion.

33:10.972 --> 33:14.135
Still looks like you have a
pretty good body, is that right?

33:14.342 --> 33:15.707
Decency forbids...

33:15.910 --> 33:17.138
Shut up!

33:17.645 --> 33:20.637
Is that right?
Have you kept your body up?

33:21.149 --> 33:23.640
It's still pretty good. I work out.

33:25.353 --> 33:27.981
Yes, he has a very firm body.

33:28.489 --> 33:30.957
Have you? I think that's very nice.

33:31.325 --> 33:33.987
You know, once you have it,
you never know...

33:34.328 --> 33:35.818
...when it'll come in handy!

33:38.499 --> 33:40.967
I say, why give it up until you have to?

33:44.772 --> 33:46.933
I couldn't agree with you more!

33:47.341 --> 33:49.002
Your obscenity is beyond human...

33:49.343 --> 33:52.176
George here doesn't cotton
too much to body talk.

33:52.413 --> 33:57.373
Paunchy isn't happy when the talk
moves to muscles. How much you weigh?

33:59.253 --> 34:00.686
155, 150...

34:01.856 --> 34:04.848
Still at the old middleweight limit?
That's pretty good!

34:08.730 --> 34:11.062
Tell them about the boxing match we had.

34:12.867 --> 34:13.697
Christ!

34:15.369 --> 34:16.666
Tell them about it.

34:16.938 --> 34:18.996
You tell them, you're good at it.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.204
- Is he all right?
- Him? Oh, sure.

34:23.210 --> 34:24.940
We had this boxing match...

34:25.213 --> 34:27.204
...a couple years after we married.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.539
A boxing match? The two of you?

34:30.717 --> 34:32.708
Yeah, the two of us. Really.

34:33.721 --> 34:35.210
I can't imagine it!

34:35.556 --> 34:38.217
Well, it wasn't in a ring
or anything like that.

34:38.893 --> 34:41.225
Daddy was on this physical fitness kick.

34:41.896 --> 34:45.559
He had a couple of us over one Sunday
and we all went out back...

34:45.900 --> 34:50.063
...and Daddy put the gloves on himself
and asked George to box with him.

34:51.906 --> 34:53.897
And George didn't want to.

34:54.641 --> 34:59.602
So Daddy said, “Come on, young man!
What sort of a son-in-law are you? “

35:01.249 --> 35:05.083
And while this was going on,
I don't know why I did it...

35:05.419 --> 35:07.887
...I got into a pair of gloves myself...

35:08.089 --> 35:12.583
...and I snuck up behind George,
just kidding and yelled, “Hey, George! “

35:13.261 --> 35:17.254
And let go with a sort of roundhouse
right. Just kidding, you know.

35:18.099 --> 35:22.661
And George wheeled around real quick
and caught it right in the jaw!

35:25.807 --> 35:28.332
He caught it right in the jaw!

35:29.443 --> 35:33.812
He was off-balance. He must have been.
And then he landed...

35:34.048 --> 35:36.608
...flat in a huckleberry bush!

35:59.574 --> 36:00.541
Pow, you're dead.

36:07.315 --> 36:09.306
Where'd you get that, you bastard?

36:09.650 --> 36:12.312
I've had it awhile. Liked that, did
you?

36:12.653 --> 36:13.642
Bastard!

36:16.324 --> 36:19.316
Oh, that was pretty good.
Hey, give me a kiss.

36:19.660 --> 36:22.151
- Later, sweetie.
- Give me a kiss.

36:26.934 --> 36:30.335
So that's what you're after?
We having blue games for the guests?

36:30.671 --> 36:34.004
Everything in its place.
Everything in it's own good time.

36:34.842 --> 36:36.833
Drinks now. Drinks for all.

36:37.178 --> 36:39.169
You've nibbled away at your glass.

36:40.014 --> 36:43.347
I need something.
I was never so frightened in my life.

36:43.684 --> 36:45.276
Weren't you frightened?

36:46.854 --> 36:49.448
- I don't remember.
- I bet you were.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.521
Did you think I was going to kill you?

36:51.826 --> 36:54.351
You? Kill me? That's a laugh!

36:54.695 --> 36:55.855
I might some day.

36:57.365 --> 36:58.559
Fat chance!

36:58.799 --> 37:00.130
Where's the john?

37:01.202 --> 37:02.362
Down the hall and right.

37:02.703 --> 37:05.194
Don't come back with
any guns or anything.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.201
You don't need any props,
do you, baby?

37:08.709 --> 37:10.108
I'll bet not.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.712
- No fake gun for you!
- May I leave my drink here?

37:14.081 --> 37:17.608
Why not? We've got half-filled glasses
wherever Martha left them.

37:17.852 --> 37:20.878
In the closet, the bathtub.
I found one in the freezer.

37:21.088 --> 37:24.057
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did.

37:26.894 --> 37:29.454
- Brandy gives you no hangover?
- I never mix.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.997
- I don't drink very much either.
- Oh, good.

37:34.068 --> 37:36.559
Your husband was telling us
about chromosomes.

37:37.571 --> 37:40.870
- Chromosomes. He's a biologist.
- He's in the Math Department.

37:41.075 --> 37:43.566
- Biologist.
- He's in the Math Department!

37:45.613 --> 37:46.739
Biology.

37:48.416 --> 37:49.747
Are you sure?

37:50.084 --> 37:52.245
Well, I ought to be sure.

37:53.754 --> 37:56.416
So he's a biologist. Good for him!

37:57.425 --> 37:59.086
Biology's even better.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.752
It's at the meat of things.
You're at the meat of things.

38:03.297 --> 38:07.097
- She thought you were Math Department.
- Maybe I ought to be.

38:07.435 --> 38:11.098
You stay right where you are.
Stay right at the meat of things.

38:11.739 --> 38:14.264
You're obsessed by that phrase.
It's ugly.

38:14.608 --> 38:15.939
You stay right there.

38:17.111 --> 38:21.104
You can take over the History Department
as easy from there as any place else.

38:21.782 --> 38:25.115
Somebody's got to take over
the History Department some day.

38:25.453 --> 38:28.786
And it ain't gonna be Georgie-boy
over there, that's for sure.

38:29.123 --> 38:31.648
Are you swampy, are you?

38:32.460 --> 38:35.452
In my mind you are bedded in cement
up to the neck.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.722
No, up to the nose, it's quieter.

38:45.006 --> 38:46.132
When is your son...

38:47.341 --> 38:47.932
What?

38:48.275 --> 38:49.640
Something about your son.

38:54.849 --> 38:56.817
When is your son coming home?

39:04.325 --> 39:05.656
When's our son coming home?

39:05.993 --> 39:06.823
Never mind.

39:07.161 --> 39:10.494
I want to know. You brought it up.
When's he coming home?

39:11.499 --> 39:14.195
I said never mind.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

39:14.468 --> 39:17.835
Him up! Not it! You brought him up,
more or less.

39:18.339 --> 39:21.672
When's the little bugger appearing?
Isn't tomorrow his birthday?

39:22.009 --> 39:23.840
I don't want to talk about it.

39:24.512 --> 39:26.537
I don't want to talk about it!

39:26.747 --> 39:29.181
She doesn't want to talk about it, him.

39:29.383 --> 39:32.250
Martha is sorry she brought it up. Him.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.852
When's the little bugger coming home?

39:36.724 --> 39:40.854
Since you had the bad taste to
bring it up, when is the bugger coming?

39:41.362 --> 39:44.525
George talks disparagingly about
the little bugger...

39:44.865 --> 39:46.890
...because he has problems.

39:47.101 --> 39:49.262
What problems has the little bugger got?

39:49.470 --> 39:52.200
Not the little bugger.
Stop calling him that!

39:52.540 --> 39:57.307
- You! You've got problems!
- Never heard anything more ridiculous.

39:57.878 --> 39:59.368
Neither have I!

40:00.881 --> 40:04.044
George's biggest problem
about the... about our son...

40:04.385 --> 40:08.219
...about our great big son is that deep
down in the private pit of his gut...

40:08.556 --> 40:11.719
...he is not completely sure that it's
his own kid.

40:12.059 --> 40:14.027
My God, you're a wicked woman!

40:14.228 --> 40:18.562
And I've told you a million times,
I wouldn't conceive with anyone else.

40:18.899 --> 40:20.764
A deeply wicked person.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.330
I'm not sure this is a subject for...

40:24.605 --> 40:28.405
Martha's lying. I want you
to know that Martha is lying.

40:29.243 --> 40:32.076
There are few things I am certain of,
but the one thing...

40:32.279 --> 40:34.839
...in this sinking world
that I am sure of...

40:35.049 --> 40:38.246
...is my partnership,
my chromosomoligical partnership...

40:38.452 --> 40:42.650
...in the creation of our blond-eyed,
blue-haired son.

40:43.724 --> 40:45.089
I'm so glad.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.287
- A very pretty speech, George.
- Thank you, Martha.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.863
You rose to the occasion good.
Real good.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.531
Well. Real well!

40:56.270 --> 40:57.635
Martha knows better.

40:57.905 --> 41:00.703
Yes, I've been to college
like everybody else.

41:01.041 --> 41:04.533
George, our son does not
have blue hair.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.212
Or blue eyes for that matter.
He has green eyes like me.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.881
Beautiful, beautiful green eyes.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.541
He has blue eyes.

41:12.887 --> 41:13.581
Green.

41:14.054 --> 41:14.884
Blue, Martha.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.587
Green, you bastard!

41:17.591 --> 41:19.889
Tut-tut yourself, you old floozy.

41:20.194 --> 41:21.889
He's not a floozie.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.460
He can't be a floozie.
You're a floozie.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.598
Now you just watch yourself!

41:28.068 --> 41:29.399
All right!

41:30.070 --> 41:33.301
I'd like another little nipper
of brandy please.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.508
- I think you've had enough.
- Nonsense!

41:35.743 --> 41:38.337
- We're all ready, I think.
- Nonsense!

41:41.048 --> 41:45.075
George has watery blue eyes,
kind of milky blue.

41:45.286 --> 41:46.617
Make up your mind.

41:46.820 --> 41:50.551
I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
Daddy has green eyes too.

41:50.758 --> 41:55.252
No, he has tiny red eyes, like a white
mouse. In fact, he is a white mouse.

41:56.430 --> 41:59.422
You wouldn't say that if he was here.
You're a coward!

41:59.767 --> 42:03.100
You know that shock of white hair
and these beady red eyes?

42:03.437 --> 42:05.098
A great big white mouse.

42:05.773 --> 42:10.437
George hates Daddy. Not for anything
Daddy's done to him, but for his own...

42:10.778 --> 42:11.938
Inadequacies?

42:12.279 --> 42:15.271
That's right.
You hit it right on the snout!

42:15.783 --> 42:18.445
You know why the S.O.B.
Hates my father?

42:18.786 --> 42:22.119
When George came to the History
Department, about 500 years ago...

42:22.456 --> 42:23.616
...Daddy approved of him.

42:24.124 --> 42:28.117
And you want to know what I did,
dumb cluck that I am?

42:28.462 --> 42:30.327
I fell for him!

42:30.731 --> 42:32.130
I like that!

42:32.466 --> 42:34.434
She did, you should have seen it.

42:34.635 --> 42:38.127
She'd sit outside my room at night
and howl and claw at the turf.

42:38.439 --> 42:40.270
I couldn't work so I married her.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.474
I actually fell for him.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.810
It! That! There!

42:47.147 --> 42:48.637
Martha's a romantic at heart.

42:50.317 --> 42:51.477
That I am.

42:53.320 --> 42:57.654
I actually fell for him.
And the match seemed practical too.

42:58.492 --> 43:01.325
For a while Daddy thought
George had the stuff...

43:01.662 --> 43:03.823
...to take over when
he was ready to retire.

43:05.332 --> 43:07.027
- Stop it!
- What do you want?!

43:07.501 --> 43:10.299
- I wouldn't go on if I were you.
- You wouldn't? Well, you're not!

43:10.504 --> 43:13.200
You've already sprung a leak
about you-know-what.

43:13.741 --> 43:14.366
What?

43:14.675 --> 43:16.836
About the little bugger. Our son.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.168
If you start in on this, I warn you...

43:19.513 --> 43:22.380
- I stand warned.
- Do we have to go through this?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.047
Anyway, I married the S.O.B.
I had it all planned out.

43:26.253 --> 43:30.519
First he'd take over the History
Department, then the whole college.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.519
That's how it was supposed to be!

43:32.860 --> 43:33.849
Getting angry?

43:34.194 --> 43:37.357
That was how it was supposed to be.
All very simple.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.531
Daddy thought it was a good idea too.
For a while!

43:40.868 --> 43:43.530
Until he started watching
for a couple of years.

43:43.871 --> 43:44.860
Getting angry?

43:45.205 --> 43:47.196
Till he watched for a couple years...

43:47.541 --> 43:50.203
...and started thinking
it wasn't such a good idea.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.536
That maybe Georgie-boy
didn't have the stuff!

43:54.014 --> 43:55.743
That he didn't have it in him!

43:55.949 --> 43:58.383
- Stop it, Martha!
- Like hell, I will!

43:59.453 --> 44:02.547
George didn't have much push.
He wasn't aggressive.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.381
In fact, he was sort of a flop!

44:06.060 --> 44:08.221
A great big, fat flop!

44:09.263 --> 44:10.730
I said stop it!

44:11.065 --> 44:15.399
I hope that was an empty bottle.
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

44:15.736 --> 44:19.570
Not on your salary! Not on
an associate professor's salary!

44:20.407 --> 44:23.570
So here I am, stuck with this flop...

44:23.911 --> 44:26.243
...this bog in the History Department.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.071
Who's married
to the president's daughter...

44:29.416 --> 44:33.409
...who's expected to be somebody.
Not just a nobody!

44:33.754 --> 44:37.417
A bookworm who's so
goddamn complacent...

44:37.758 --> 44:40.090
...he can't make anything
out of himself.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.760
That doesn't have the guts
to make anybody proud of him!

44:46.600 --> 44:48.431
All right, George, stop it!

44:50.804 --> 44:52.499
I'm going to be sick!

45:25.172 --> 45:27.640
She'll be all right.
I'll make some coffee.

45:28.475 --> 45:31.205
- You sure?
- She'll be okay.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.600
I'm really very sorry.

47:44.111 --> 47:47.103
She really shouldn't drink.
She's frail.

47:50.617 --> 47:52.107
Slim-hipped, as you say.

47:55.622 --> 47:58.955
Where's my little yum-yum?
Where's Martha?

48:00.794 --> 48:03.661
I think she's going to make some coffee.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.766
She gets sick quite easily.

48:11.305 --> 48:14.297
Martha? No, she hasn't been
sick a day in her life.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.973
Unless you count time
she spends in the rest home.

48:17.311 --> 48:18.801
No, no. My wife.

48:19.146 --> 48:23.310
My wife gets sick quite easily.
Your wife is Martha.

48:26.820 --> 48:27.650
I know.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.814
She doesn't really spend any time
in a rest home?

48:33.327 --> 48:34.316
Your wife?

48:34.995 --> 48:35.984
No, yours.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.161
Mine?

48:44.004 --> 48:46.165
She doesn't. I would.

48:49.810 --> 48:52.506
If I were her... she... I would.

48:52.846 --> 48:55.178
But then I'm not and so I don't.

48:57.684 --> 48:59.311
I'd like to, though.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.854
It gets pretty bouncy
around here sometimes.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.519
Yes, I'm sure.

49:10.764 --> 49:13.426
- Your wife throws up a lot?
- I didn't say that.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.030
I said she gets sick quite easily.

49:17.237 --> 49:18.864
By sick I thought that you meant she...

49:19.373 --> 49:22.399
It's true, actually.
She does throw up a lot.

49:22.609 --> 49:23.701
The word is often.

49:25.245 --> 49:27.873
Once she starts
there's practically no stopping.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.942
She'll go right on for hours.

49:34.955 --> 49:36.582
Not all the time.

49:38.825 --> 49:39.883
Regularly.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.991
- You can tell time by her?
- Just about.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.809
I married her because she was pregnant.

50:02.716 --> 50:05.014
But you said you didn't have
any children.

50:05.218 --> 50:06.708
She wasn't really. It was a...

50:08.889 --> 50:10.220
...hysterical pregnancy.

50:12.392 --> 50:15.555
She blew up and then she went down.

50:17.097 --> 50:19.292
And when she was up you married her?

50:21.068 --> 50:22.797
Then she went down.

50:45.659 --> 50:47.559
When I was 16...

50:48.829 --> 50:51.423
...and going to prep school,
during the Punic Wars...

50:54.034 --> 50:56.935
...a bunch of us would go to town
the first day of vacation...

50:57.270 --> 50:59.261
...before we fanned out to our homes.

51:01.708 --> 51:04.836
And in the evening
we would go to a gin mill...

51:05.112 --> 51:07.774
...owned by the gangster-father
of one of us...

51:08.115 --> 51:12.108
...and we would drink with the grown-ups
and listen to the jazz.

51:13.954 --> 51:15.785
And one time, in the bunch of us...

51:16.123 --> 51:17.681
...there was this...

51:18.225 --> 51:20.819
...boy who was 15...

51:21.628 --> 51:25.792
...and he had killed his mother
with a shotgun some years before.

51:27.134 --> 51:29.125
Completely accidentally...

51:29.469 --> 51:33.132
...without even an unconscious
motivation, I have no doubt at all.

51:35.242 --> 51:37.802
And this one time this boy
went with us and...

51:38.645 --> 51:40.840
...we ordered our drinks...

51:41.748 --> 51:44.012
...and when it came his turn he said...

51:44.684 --> 51:46.652
“I'll have bergin.

51:47.354 --> 51:51.814
“Give me some bergin please.
Bergin and water.”

51:54.928 --> 51:56.452
We all laughed.

51:57.430 --> 52:02.458
He was blond and he had the face
of a cherub, and we all laughed.

52:03.637 --> 52:07.129
And his cheeks went red
and the color rose in his neck.

52:07.674 --> 52:12.611
The waiter told people at the next table
what the boy said and they laughed...

52:13.013 --> 52:17.507
...and then more people were told
and the laughter grew and grew.

52:22.756 --> 52:25.418
No one was laughing more than us...

52:25.759 --> 52:29.593
...and none of us more than the boy
who had shot his mother.

52:32.098 --> 52:36.262
And soon everyone in the gin mill
knew what the laughter was about...

52:36.603 --> 52:41.267
...and everyone started ordering bergin
and laughing when they ordered it.

52:42.442 --> 52:45.434
And soon, of course,
the laughter became less general...

52:45.779 --> 52:50.113
...but it did not subside entirely
for a very long time.

52:50.450 --> 52:53.442
For always at this table or that...

52:53.954 --> 52:55.945
...someone would order bergin...

52:56.990 --> 53:00.790
...and a whole new area
of laughter would rise.

53:02.629 --> 53:04.119
We drank free that night.

53:05.398 --> 53:07.628
We were bought champagne
by the management...

53:07.968 --> 53:11.131
...by the gangster-father of one of us.

53:13.306 --> 53:16.969
And, of course,
we suffered the next day...

53:17.310 --> 53:21.644
...each of us alone,
on his train away from the city...

53:23.383 --> 53:27.149
...and each of us
with a grown-up's hangover.

53:29.656 --> 53:31.749
But it was the grandest day...

53:33.159 --> 53:34.490
...of my...

53:36.029 --> 53:37.360
...youth.

53:49.476 --> 53:50.807
What happened to the boy?

53:53.880 --> 53:55.370
The boy who had shot his mother.

53:58.218 --> 53:59.207
I won't tell you.

54:02.422 --> 54:06.051
The next summer on a country road,
with his learner's permit...

54:06.259 --> 54:10.958
...and his father sitting to his right,
he swerved to avoid a porcupine...

54:12.065 --> 54:14.898
...and drove straight into a large tree.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.728
He was not killed, of course.

54:19.906 --> 54:23.398
In the hospital when he was conscious
and out of danger...

54:23.743 --> 54:26.234
...when they told him
his father was dead...

54:27.914 --> 54:30.906
...he began to laugh, I have been told.

54:32.252 --> 54:35.915
And his laughter grew
and would not stop.

54:37.924 --> 54:41.587
And it was not until after
they'd jammed a needle in his arm...

54:41.928 --> 54:46.262
...not until his consciousness
had slipped away from him...

54:46.599 --> 54:50.262
...that his laughter subsided. Stopped.

54:52.439 --> 54:54.771
When he recovered
from his injuries enough...

54:55.108 --> 54:59.772
...so he could be moved without damage
should he struggle...

55:02.115 --> 55:04.140
...he was put in an asylum.

55:07.454 --> 55:09.115
That was thirty years ago.

55:10.790 --> 55:12.451
Is he still there?

55:14.461 --> 55:15.519
Oh, yes.

55:16.963 --> 55:19.124
I'm told that for these thirty years...

55:21.001 --> 55:22.798
...he has not uttered...

55:24.471 --> 55:27.133
...one sound.

55:49.362 --> 55:50.659
That's Big Martha.

55:51.531 --> 55:52.998
She's making coffee.

55:54.334 --> 55:57.997
For your hysterical wife,
who goes up and down.

55:59.005 --> 55:59.733
Went.

56:00.340 --> 56:01.864
Up and down.

56:02.342 --> 56:04.333
Went? And no more?

56:05.345 --> 56:07.506
No more. Nothing.

56:10.016 --> 56:12.746
Martha doesn't have
hysterical pregnancies.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.454
My wife had one.

56:15.688 --> 56:18.179
Martha doesn't have pregnancies at all.

56:21.861 --> 56:25.297
Do you have any other kids,
any daughters or anything?

56:26.866 --> 56:28.697
Do we have any what?

56:32.038 --> 56:34.165
I mean, do you only have
the one...

56:34.941 --> 56:36.533
...kid, your son?

56:38.711 --> 56:40.201
No, just one.

56:41.881 --> 56:43.109
One boy.

56:44.551 --> 56:45.916
Our son.

56:51.157 --> 56:52.419
That's nice.

56:55.061 --> 56:57.052
He's a comfort.

56:58.898 --> 57:00.229
He's a beanbag.

57:03.369 --> 57:04.336
A what?

57:04.571 --> 57:06.402
A beanbag. You wouldn't understand.

57:08.741 --> 57:10.470
A beanbag!

57:10.677 --> 57:14.204
I heard! I didn't say I was deaf,
I said I didn't understand!

57:14.414 --> 57:19.215
- You didn't say that at all.
- I was implying I didn't understand.

57:21.254 --> 57:22.721
- You're getting testy.
- I'm sorry!

57:22.922 --> 57:27.256
I just said our son, the apple of
our 3 eyes, Martha being a Cyclops...

57:27.760 --> 57:29.921
...our son is a beanbag,
and you get testy.

57:30.263 --> 57:33.562
It's late, I'm tired.
I've been drinking since 9 o'clock.

57:33.766 --> 57:37.167
My wife is vomiting.
There's been a lot of screaming here.

57:37.370 --> 57:39.634
You get testy, naturally.
Don't worry about it.

57:39.839 --> 57:43.002
Anybody coming here gets testy.
Don't be upset.

57:43.209 --> 57:45.404
- I'm not upset.
- You're testy.

57:49.949 --> 57:53.942
I'd like to set you straight
about something while we're out here.

57:54.787 --> 57:56.948
About something Martha said.

57:58.291 --> 58:00.282
Hark! Forest sounds.

58:01.294 --> 58:02.625
Animal noises.

58:05.198 --> 58:07.132
Oh, well, here's nursie!

58:08.134 --> 58:10.466
We're sitting up, we're having coffee.

58:12.138 --> 58:14.129
Is there anything I should do?

58:14.474 --> 58:18.808
No, you just stay there
and listen to Georgie's side of things.

58:19.312 --> 58:20.973
Bore yourself to death!

58:21.247 --> 58:23.807
You clean up the mess you made in here?

58:24.150 --> 58:27.142
No, Martha, I did not
clean up the mess I made.

58:28.521 --> 58:32.287
I've been trying for years
to clean up the mess I made.

58:32.659 --> 58:34.354
Have you been trying for years?

58:34.561 --> 58:36.654
Accommodation, adjustment...

58:37.163 --> 58:39.654
...those do seem to be
in the order of things.

58:39.866 --> 58:41.663
Don't put me in the same class with you.

58:42.001 --> 58:45.493
No, of course not.
I mean things are simpler for you.

58:46.639 --> 58:49.130
You marry a woman
because she's all blown up.

58:49.342 --> 58:54.109
- Where I, in my old-fashioned way...
- There was more to it than that.

58:54.314 --> 58:56.305
Sure. I bet she has money too.

58:59.519 --> 59:00.144
Yes.

59:06.526 --> 59:08.187
You mean I was right? I hit it?

59:08.861 --> 59:12.729
My God, what archery! First try, too.
How about that?

59:13.366 --> 59:15.357
- There were other things.
- Yes.

59:15.568 --> 59:17.195
To compensate.

59:18.037 --> 59:19.902
There always are.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.236
Allow me.

59:25.044 --> 59:28.036
Tell me about your wife's money.

59:31.284 --> 59:32.216
No.

59:32.719 --> 59:34.118
Okay, don't.

59:38.191 --> 59:40.921
My father-in-law was a man of the Lord.

59:42.195 --> 59:43.685
And he was very rich.

59:44.197 --> 59:45.186
What faith?

59:47.867 --> 59:49.027
My father-in-law...

59:50.203 --> 59:53.366
...was called by God
when he was six or something.

59:55.375 --> 59:59.869
He started preaching, baptized people,
and he saved them and then...

01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:05.783
...he traveled around a lot and
became pretty famous. Not like...

01:00:07.387 --> 01:00:08.877
...some of them but...

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:12.319
...pretty famous.

01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:17.719
When he died he had a lot of money.

01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:21.391
- God's money?
- No, his own.

01:00:22.468 --> 01:00:26.063
- What about God's money?
- He spent it and he saved his own.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.230
I think that's very nice.

01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:34.437
Martha has money because...

01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:37.480
...Martha's father's second wife...

01:00:37.684 --> 01:00:40.585
...not Martha's mother,
but after her mother died...

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.111
...was a very old lady...

01:00:43.323 --> 01:00:46.417
...who had warts, who was very rich.

01:00:46.993 --> 01:00:48.392
She was a witch!

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:53.032
She was a good witch,
and she married the white mouse...

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.530
...with the red eyes,
and he must have...

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.533
...nibbled her warts
or something...

01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:04.166
...because she went up in a
puff of smoke almost immediately.

01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:10.646
And all that was left,
apart from some wart medicine...

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.318
...was a big, fat will.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.393
Maybe my father-in-law...

01:01:21.627 --> 01:01:24.790
...and the witch with the warts
should have gotten together.

01:01:26.132 --> 01:01:28.123
Because he was a mouse too.

01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:31.770
- He was?
- Sure!

01:01:34.474 --> 01:01:36.305
He was a church mouse!

01:01:53.326 --> 01:01:55.294
Your wife never mentioned a stepmother.

01:01:56.496 --> 01:01:57.724
Maybe it isn't true.

01:01:59.999 --> 01:02:03.162
You realize I've been
drawing you out on this stuff...

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.533
...because you're a threat to me
and I want to get the goods on you.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.729
Sure.

01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:11.067
I've warned you. You stand warned.

01:02:11.277 --> 01:02:12.835
I stand warned.

01:02:15.281 --> 01:02:18.307
You sneaky types
worry me the most, you know.

01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:21.510
You ineffectual sons of bitches,
you're the worst.

01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:25.620
I'm glad you don't believe me.
You've got history on your side.

01:02:27.026 --> 01:02:30.518
You've got history on your side.
I've got biology on mine.

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:33.021
History, biology.

01:02:33.366 --> 01:02:35.334
- I know the difference.
- You don't act it.

01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:39.831
We decided you'd take over the History
Department first, then the whole works.

01:02:40.039 --> 01:02:40.869
A step at a time.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:49.211
What I thought I'd do is sort of
insinuate myself generally. You know!

01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:51.210
Find all the weak spots.

01:02:52.585 --> 01:02:53.609
Like me.

01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:58.380
Become sort of a fact
and then turn into a...

01:03:00.793 --> 01:03:03.557
- A what?
- An inevitability?

01:03:04.063 --> 01:03:05.155
Exactly!

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:07.229
An inevitability.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.562
Take over a few courses
from the older men.

01:03:13.239 --> 01:03:15.230
Plow a few pertinent wives.

01:03:15.575 --> 01:03:16.564
Now that's it!

01:03:17.743 --> 01:03:19.904
You can shove aside
all the older men...

01:03:20.246 --> 01:03:23.409
...but until you're plowing pertinent
wives you're not working.

01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:25.740
That's the way to power. Plow 'em all!

01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:30.252
The way to a man's heart...

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:34.492
...the wide, inviting avenue to his job
is through his wife...

01:03:34.694 --> 01:03:36.161
...and don't you forget it.

01:03:36.362 --> 01:03:41.095
I bet your wife's got the most inviting
avenue on the whole campus!

01:03:45.104 --> 01:03:47.504
I mean, her father
being president and all.

01:03:48.608 --> 01:03:51.099
You bet your historical inevitability.

01:03:51.944 --> 01:03:54.936
I just better get her off
into the bushes right away.

01:03:55.147 --> 01:03:56.614
You'd certainly better.

01:03:59.619 --> 01:04:01.211
I almost think you're serious.

01:04:02.054 --> 01:04:05.182
No, you almost think you're serious.
And it scares you.

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:06.387
Me?

01:04:06.959 --> 01:04:07.857
Yes, you.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.118
You're kidding!

01:04:09.462 --> 01:04:13.125
I wish I were. I'll give you some
good advice if you want me to.

01:04:13.466 --> 01:04:14.933
Good advice? From you?

01:04:15.968 --> 01:04:19.961
You haven't learned yet. Take it
wherever you can get it. Listen.

01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:23.298
I'm giving you good advice now.

01:04:24.977 --> 01:04:28.435
There's quicksand here and you'll be
dragged down before you know it.

01:04:28.648 --> 01:04:29.876
Sucked down!

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:34.483
You disgust me on principle and you're
a smug son of a bitch...

01:04:34.987 --> 01:04:38.650
...but I'm trying to give you
a survival kit. Do you hear me?

01:04:38.858 --> 01:04:40.621
I hear you. You come in loud.

01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:42.824
You want to play it by ear, right?

01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:46.825
Everything will work out anyway,
because the timetable's history, right?

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:50.158
Right. Just tend to your knitting,
grandma. I'll be okay.

01:04:50.503 --> 01:04:51.834
I've tried to...

01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:54.328
...tried to reach you, to...

01:04:54.674 --> 01:04:55.663
Make contact?

01:04:56.842 --> 01:04:57.831
Communicate?

01:04:58.177 --> 01:04:59.166
Yes, exactly.

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:04.006
Aw, that's touching. That's downright
moving, that's what that is.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.476
Up yours!

01:05:05.685 --> 01:05:08.483
- What?
- You heard me.

01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:18.527
You take the trouble
to construct a civilization...

01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:23.528
...to build a society based on
the principles of... principle.

01:05:24.537 --> 01:05:28.371
You make government and art and realize
they are, must be, the same.

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:33.202
You bring things to the saddest point,
where there is something to lose.

01:05:33.879 --> 01:05:36.211
Then, all at once,
through all the music...

01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:38.813
...through the sensible sounds
of building...

01:05:39.218 --> 01:05:41.379
...attempting, comes the Dies Irae.

01:05:41.721 --> 01:05:44.383
And what is it?
What does the trumpet sound?

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:46.388
Up yours!

01:05:52.565 --> 01:05:56.228
Here we are.
A little shaky, but on our feet.

01:05:56.435 --> 01:05:58.403
It wasn't too bad, dear, really.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.400
- I'm not cold.
- Just put it on, we're leaving.

01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:03.575
- You're what?
- We're going home.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:06.434
What's been going on here?

01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:08.637
- What have you been up to?
- I'll get the car.

01:06:08.848 --> 01:06:10.008
I'll call a cab.

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:13.912
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.588
Now let me see.
I think what I'm doing is...

01:06:16.922 --> 01:06:21.086
...I'm getting the car to take
our little guests home.

01:06:31.771 --> 01:06:33.432
Aren't you going to apologize?

01:06:33.773 --> 01:06:35.263
The road should've been straight.

01:06:35.608 --> 01:06:37.599
Not that. For making her throw up.

01:06:37.943 --> 01:06:40.377
- I did not make her throw up.
- You certainly did.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.613
Who do you think did, sexy there?
He made his own wife sick?

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.248
- You make me sick.
- That's different.

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:49.454
Please! I throw up.

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:52.587
I get sick occasionally all by myself,
without reason.

01:06:52.792 --> 01:06:54.453
- Is that a fact?
- You're delicate, honey.

01:06:55.461 --> 01:06:56.894
I've always done it.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.461
Like Big Ben?

01:06:58.664 --> 01:06:59.790
Watch it.

01:07:00.132 --> 01:07:03.192
George makes everybody sick.
When our son was a little boy...

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:06.303
...he threw up all the time
because of George.

01:07:06.639 --> 01:07:11.303
It got so whenever George came into
a room, he'd start right in retching.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.308
Our son used to throw up all the time...

01:07:14.647 --> 01:07:16.478
...because you were always
fiddling at him.

01:07:16.816 --> 01:07:19.478
Into his bedroom,
kimono flying, fiddling...

01:07:19.819 --> 01:07:22.811
I suppose that's why he ran away
twice in one month.

01:07:23.155 --> 01:07:25.988
Twice in one month!
Six times in one year...

01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:29.817
Our son ran away from home
because Martha used to corner him.

01:07:30.162 --> 01:07:33.325
I never cornered
the son of a bitch in my life!

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:37.659
He'd run to me when I got home
and say, “Mama's always coming at me.”

01:07:38.003 --> 01:07:39.095
Liar!

01:07:40.172 --> 01:07:42.231
Always coming at him.
Very embarrassing!

01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:45.337
If it was so embarrassing,
why are you talking about it?

01:07:46.178 --> 01:07:47.839
I didn't want to talk about it at all.

01:07:48.514 --> 01:07:52.006
I wish I had some brandy.
I love brandy, I really do.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:54.877
- Good for you.
- It steadies me.

01:07:55.087 --> 01:07:56.850
I used to drink brandy.

01:07:57.523 --> 01:07:59.184
You used to drink bergin, too.

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:00.514
Shut up, Martha!

01:08:03.429 --> 01:08:05.226
- What?
- Nothing.

01:08:06.866 --> 01:08:10.859
Did he tell you about that?
Come on, he must have said something.

01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:14.695
Actually what we did is
we sort of danced around a little.

01:08:15.274 --> 01:08:17.332
I love dancing. I really do.

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:18.372
He didn't mean that.

01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:22.545
Well, I didn't think that he did!
Two grown men dancing!

01:08:24.216 --> 01:08:27.879
He didn't tell how he tried to publish
a book and Daddy wouldn't let him?

01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:30.880
- A book? What book?
- Just a book.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:32.557
Just a book!

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:34.325
Oh, look, dancing!

01:08:34.794 --> 01:08:37.763
Why don't we dance?
I'd love some dancing.

01:08:38.063 --> 01:08:40.031
- We're almost home.
- I want some dancing!

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:43.064
- That's not such a bad idea.
- Don't you love dancing?

01:08:43.402 --> 01:08:46.564
- With the right man, yeah.
- I dance like the wind.

01:08:47.907 --> 01:08:50.569
Stop the car. We're going dancing!

01:08:50.776 --> 01:08:52.573
- For heaven's sake!
- Did you hear me?

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.505
Whatever love wants.

01:09:02.188 --> 01:09:04.053
I dance like the wind!

01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:07.252
Put one on, will you?

01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:10.755
How are we going to work this,
mixed doubles?

01:09:11.263 --> 01:09:13.254
You don't think I'm going
to dance with you?

01:09:13.599 --> 01:09:16.261
Not with him around.
And not with twinkle-toes either.

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:20.298
I'll dance with anyone!
I'll dance with myself!

01:09:21.106 --> 01:09:24.974
- Honey, you'll get sick again.
- I dance like the wind!

01:09:29.782 --> 01:09:32.113
All right, kiddies, choose up
and hit the sack.

01:09:33.285 --> 01:09:35.947
All right, George, cut that out!

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:42.624
Cut it out, George!

01:09:43.295 --> 01:09:44.125
What, Martha?

01:09:45.464 --> 01:09:47.625
All right, you son of a bitch!

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:49.562
- What'd you say, love?
- It stopped!

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:51.234
Why did it stop?

01:09:53.305 --> 01:09:55.773
I said give me some change.

01:09:58.143 --> 01:09:59.007
Stop that!

01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:02.613
You are always at me
when I'm having a good time!

01:10:02.815 --> 01:10:07.115
Just leave me alone. I like to dance
and you don't want me to.

01:10:07.319 --> 01:10:09.480
Just leave me alone!

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:15.954
Choose it. Do your stuff.

01:10:16.662 --> 01:10:17.993
You're damned right.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:19.764
Hi, sexy!

01:10:20.032 --> 01:10:21.932
You want to dance, angel boobs?

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:24.625
What'd you call my wife?

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:29.964
No, if I can't do my interpretive dance,
I don't want to dance at all.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.799
I'll just sit here.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.972
Okay, stuff, let's go.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.009
- We'll just sit here and watch.
- That's right.

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:55.993
You are strong, aren't you?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.833
I like that.

01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:00.902
They dance like they've danced before.

01:11:01.106 --> 01:11:04.166
A familiar dance, monkey nipples,
they know it.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.000
I don't know what you mean.

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:11.710
- I like the way you move.
- I like the way you move too.

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.078
- They like the way they move.
- That's nice.

01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:20.181
I'm surprised George didn't tell you
his side of things.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:22.653
- Well, he didn't.
- That surprises me.

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:24.658
- Does it?
- Aren't they cute?

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:26.558
He usually does when he can.

01:11:26.765 --> 01:11:28.323
I don't think he trusts me.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:32.868
It's really a very sad story.

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.705
It would make you weep.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.101
You have ugly talents, Martha.

01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:40.778
Is that so?

01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:43.039
Don't encourage her.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:44.709
Encourage me.

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:46.650
I warned you, don't encourage her!

01:11:46.852 --> 01:11:48.080
He warned you.

01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:52.387
- Don't encourage me.
- I heard him. Tell me more.

01:11:57.296 --> 01:12:00.060
Georgie-boy had lots of big ambitions...

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.027
...in spite of something funny
in his past...

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:06.170
...which Georgie-boy here
turned into a novel.

01:12:06.372 --> 01:12:10.001
His first attempt and also his last!

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.002
I rhymed!

01:12:15.047 --> 01:12:16.173
I warn you!

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:20.908
But Daddy took a look
at Georgie's novel.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.088
You're looking for a punch in the mouth.

01:12:23.288 --> 01:12:24.414
Do tell!

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:27.357
And he was very shocked by what he read.

01:12:27.559 --> 01:12:29.424
- He was?
- Yes, he was.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:32.697
A novel all about a naughty boy-child.

01:12:32.998 --> 01:12:34.226
I will not tolerate this!

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:35.627
Oh, can it!

01:12:36.101 --> 01:12:38.592
A naughty boy-child...

01:12:39.004 --> 01:12:42.371
...who killed his mother...

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.936
...and his father dead!

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.100
Stop it!

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.412
And Daddy said, “Look here...

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:55.178
“... I will not let you
publish such a thing! “

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.819
The dancing's over!

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.453
Violence!

01:12:58.957 --> 01:12:59.946
And Daddy said...

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:04.786
...”You don't think I'm going to
let you publish this kind of crap? “

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.792
“Not on your life,
not while you're teaching here.”

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:11.625
“You publish that
and you're out on your ass! “

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.631
Desist! Desist!

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.297
I will not be made mock of.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.634
He will not be made mock of,
for cripes sake!

01:13:19.978 --> 01:13:21.138
The game is over!

01:13:21.513 --> 01:13:23.037
Just imagine...

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:27.475
...a book all about a boy who murders
his mother and kills his father...

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.477
...and pretends it's all an accident.

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:32.682
Hey, wait a minute!

01:13:33.158 --> 01:13:34.989
You want to know the clincher?

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:38.319
You want to know what
big brave Georgie said to Daddy?

01:13:41.433 --> 01:13:43.162
But Daddy...

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:47.169
I mean, “But, Sir, this isn't
a novel at all.”

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.495
You will not say this!

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.001
The hell, I won't! Keep away!

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:52.333
“No, sir, this is no novel at all.”

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.943
“This is the truth.
This really happened to me! “

01:13:56.148 --> 01:13:58.514
- I'll kill you.
- It happened!

01:14:02.154 --> 01:14:03.086
Violence!

01:14:13.899 --> 01:14:15.264
Very quiet now.

01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:17.533
We'll all be...

01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:19.200
...very quiet.

01:14:23.575 --> 01:14:24.405
Murderer!

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.701
What's the trouble in here?

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.213
Nothing. No trouble,
just playing a game.

01:14:33.185 --> 01:14:34.652
Well, we're closing.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.115
One more round.

01:14:36.321 --> 01:14:37.515
Same for everybody.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.385
Give us one more round
and we'll be on our merry way.

01:14:40.626 --> 01:14:42.719
All right? Good!

01:14:42.928 --> 01:14:43.860
Thanks.

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:51.562
Well, that's one game.
What shall we do now?

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:58.400
Let's do something else. We played
Humiliate the Host, what'll we do now?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.178
Oh, look!

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.139
We must know other games,
us college types.

01:15:04.349 --> 01:15:07.182
- Can't be the limit of our vocabulary.
- Haven't had enough?

01:15:07.386 --> 01:15:08.751
There are other games.

01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:10.615
How about...

01:15:11.123 --> 01:15:13.956
How about Hump the Hostess?

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:17.759
Want to play that one? Do you want
to play Hump the Hostess?

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:20.928
Or do you want to wait till later,
off in the bushes?

01:15:21.233 --> 01:15:22.257
Hump the Hostess!

01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:23.456
Will you shut up?

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:43.451
You want to save that for later.
What shall we play now?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:46.952
- Portrait of a Man Drowning.
- I'm not drowning.

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:49.927
- You told me to shut up.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:50.128 --> 01:15:50.924
I'm sorry!

01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:53.959
I know what we do.

01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:57.329
Now that we've done this round
of Humiliate the Host...

01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:59.830
...and don't want to play
Hump the Hostess yet.

01:16:00.172 --> 01:16:03.335
I know what! How about a little round
of Get the Guests?

01:16:03.675 --> 01:16:05.836
How about that? Get the Guests?

01:16:06.845 --> 01:16:08.506
Book dropper, child mentioner!

01:16:08.847 --> 01:16:09.677
I don't like these games.

01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:14.179
We've only had one game, we've got to
have another. You can't fly on one.

01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:15.451
Silence!

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.951
How will we play Get the Guests?

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:19.180
You be quiet!

01:16:19.424 --> 01:16:21.153
I wonder.

01:16:26.698 --> 01:16:30.532
Martha, in her indiscreet way,
told you all about my first novel.

01:16:30.736 --> 01:16:32.863
True or false that there
was such a thing.

01:16:33.205 --> 01:16:36.174
She told you about my first novel,
my memory book.

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:38.866
I preferred she hadn't, but
that's blood under the bridge.

01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:41.702
But what Martha didn't tell you...

01:16:42.047 --> 01:16:45.039
...what Martha didn't tell at all about
was my second novel.

01:16:45.384 --> 01:16:48.547
You didn't know about that, did you?
True or false?

01:16:50.055 --> 01:16:52.888
Well, it's an allegory really, probably.

01:16:53.225 --> 01:16:56.558
It's about a nice young couple
who comes out of the Middle West.

01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:58.393
It's a bucolic, you see.

01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:01.392
This nice young couple
comes out of the Middle West.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.568
He's blond and he's about thirty.

01:17:03.902 --> 01:17:07.394
And he's a scientist,
a teacher, a scientist.

01:17:07.739 --> 01:17:11.800
- His mouse, wifey, gargles brandy...
- Just a minute here!

01:17:12.077 --> 01:17:14.307
This is my game!
You've had your game!

01:17:14.513 --> 01:17:16.242
I want to hear. I love stories.

01:17:16.448 --> 01:17:18.416
Mousie's father was a holy man, see?

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:22.743
He ran a traveling clip joint and he
took the faithful, just took them.

01:17:23.088 --> 01:17:25.386
- This is familiar.
- No kidding.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:29.253
Anyway, Blondie and his frau
out of the Plains States came.

01:17:29.928 --> 01:17:31.589
Very funny, George.

01:17:32.164 --> 01:17:32.823
Thank you.

01:17:33.098 --> 01:17:35.362
They settled in a town
like Nouveau Carthage.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.398
- I don't think you should go on.
- Do you not?

01:17:37.602 --> 01:17:39.433
I love familiar stories.
They're the best.

01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:43.104
How right you are! But Blondie
was all in disguise as a teacher...

01:17:43.442 --> 01:17:47.742
...because his baggage ticket had
bigger things writ on it. H.I.!

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.770
Historical Inevitability.

01:17:50.115 --> 01:17:52.777
- There's no reason to go further.
- Let them go on.

01:17:53.452 --> 01:17:57.445
He had this baggage, and part of his
baggage was in the form of his mouse.

01:17:57.789 --> 01:17:59.051
We don't have to listen.

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:00.815
- Why not?
- She has a point.

01:18:01.059 --> 01:18:03.789
Nobody could figure out
Blondie's baggage, his mouse.

01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:07.792
I mean, here he was pan-Kansas
swimming champion or something...

01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:09.293
...and he had this mouse.

01:18:09.634 --> 01:18:13.297
Of whom he was solicitous to a point
that faileth human understanding...

01:18:13.638 --> 01:18:15.799
...given that she was
something of a simp.

01:18:16.141 --> 01:18:17.472
This just isn't fair of you.

01:18:17.809 --> 01:18:20.710
Perhaps not. His mouse
tooted brandy immodestly...

01:18:20.912 --> 01:18:23.437
...and spent half her time
in the upchuck.

01:18:23.648 --> 01:18:25.115
- I know these people.
- Do you?

01:18:25.317 --> 01:18:27.649
But she was money baggage
among other things.

01:18:27.986 --> 01:18:32.616
Godly money from the golden teeth of the
unfaithful and she was put up with!

01:18:32.824 --> 01:18:35.952
- I don't like this story.
- And she was put up with!

01:18:36.161 --> 01:18:37.093
Stop? Hah!

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.786
- Please, please, don't.
- Beg, baby!

01:18:40.832 --> 01:18:43.858
- Flashback to “How they got married.”
- No!

01:18:44.336 --> 01:18:46.668
- Why?
- How they got married was this.

01:18:47.172 --> 01:18:49.367
The mouse got all puffed up one day...

01:18:50.175 --> 01:18:54.009
...and she went over to Blondie's house
and stuck out her puff...

01:18:54.346 --> 01:18:55.677
...and she said, “Look at me.”

01:18:56.014 --> 01:18:57.003
I don't like this.

01:18:57.349 --> 01:19:01.683
“Look at me, I'm all puffed up.”
“Oh, my goodness,” said Blondie.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.851
And so they were married.

01:19:05.624 --> 01:19:06.750
And then what?

01:19:07.025 --> 01:19:10.688
And then the puff went away again
like magic. Poof!

01:19:13.532 --> 01:19:14.692
The puff went away?

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:20.696
Honey, I didn't mean to. Honestly.

01:19:24.209 --> 01:19:26.575
You shouldn't have told them!

01:19:26.778 --> 01:19:29.770
No! You couldn't have told them!

01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:33.077
And that's how you play Get the Guests.

01:19:34.386 --> 01:19:36.718
Oh, please! I'm going to be sick!

01:19:44.095 --> 01:19:46.063
You shouldn't have done that.

01:19:46.598 --> 01:19:48.896
- I hate hypocrisy.
- That was cruel and vicious.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.034
She'll get over it. She'll recover.

01:19:51.236 --> 01:19:52.794
- And damaging to me.
- To you!

01:19:53.004 --> 01:19:53.800
To me!

01:19:56.775 --> 01:20:01.269
Beautiful. You got to have a swine
to show you where the truffles are.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.108
Rearrange your alliances.
Make the best of things.

01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:06.883
Put your wife in the car.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.619
I've had enough rides tonight.
We'll walk.

01:20:09.955 --> 01:20:11.946
Right, you go plan some new strategy.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.185
You'll regret this.

01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:16.985
No doubt. I regret everything.

01:20:17.462 --> 01:20:19.430
No, I mean I'll make you regret this.

01:20:19.631 --> 01:20:20.461
Clean up the mess.

01:20:20.966 --> 01:20:21.955
You just wait.

01:20:23.635 --> 01:20:25.398
- Very good, George.
- Thank you.

01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:27.935
- Really good!
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:20:28.139 --> 01:20:32.667
I mean, you did a good job.
You really fixed it.

01:20:34.312 --> 01:20:36.803
That's the most life you've shown
in a long time.

01:20:37.148 --> 01:20:38.479
You bring out the best in me.

01:20:42.487 --> 01:20:44.318
You really are a bastard!

01:20:44.656 --> 01:20:47.147
You can go around like
a hopped-up Arab...

01:20:47.993 --> 01:20:51.156
...slashing at everything,
scarring up half the world...

01:20:51.463 --> 01:20:54.057
...but let somebody else try it?
Oh no!

01:20:54.332 --> 01:20:58.496
Why, baby, I did it all for you!
I thought you'd like it, sweetheart.

01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:01.828
It's to your taste,
blood, carnage and all.

01:21:02.407 --> 01:21:04.500
I thought you'd sort of get excited.

01:21:04.843 --> 01:21:08.176
Heave and pant and come running at me,
your melons bobbling...

01:21:08.513 --> 01:21:10.845
You have really screwed up, George.

01:21:11.516 --> 01:21:13.177
I mean it! You really have!

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:16.181
You can sit,
gin running from your mouth...

01:21:16.521 --> 01:21:20.514
...you can humiliate me, tear me to
pieces all night, it's perfectly okay.

01:21:20.859 --> 01:21:22.019
You can stand it!

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.349
I cannot stand it!

01:21:23.695 --> 01:21:26.528
You can stand it!
You married me for it!

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:31.365
That's a desperately sick lie.

01:21:31.703 --> 01:21:33.694
Don't you know it even yet?

01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:39.374
My arm's gotten tired whipping you.

01:21:40.378 --> 01:21:42.869
- Year after year!
- Deluded, Martha.

01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:44.203
It's not what I wanted.

01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:47.211
I thought at least you were onto
yourself. I didn't know.

01:21:47.886 --> 01:21:49.217
No. You're sick!

01:21:51.056 --> 01:21:53.684
I'll show you who's sick!

01:22:08.907 --> 01:22:12.240
You really are having
a field day, aren't you?

01:22:13.912 --> 01:22:17.245
Well, I'm gonna finish you
before I'm through with you.

01:22:17.749 --> 01:22:20.741
You and that quarterback?
You both going to finish me?

01:22:20.952 --> 01:22:25.252
Before I'm through with you you'll
wish you'd died in that automobile!

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.922
You'll wish you'd never mentioned
our son.

01:22:28.226 --> 01:22:28.954
I warned you.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.594
- I'm impressed!
- I warned you not to go too far!

01:22:31.796 --> 01:22:34.026
I'm just beginning!

01:22:34.599 --> 01:22:37.762
I'm numbed so I can take you
when we're alone. I don't listen.

01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:42.930
And if I do listen I sift it so I don't
really hear, which is the only way.

01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:46.766
But you've taken a new tack
in the last century...

01:22:47.112 --> 01:22:50.445
...which is just too much. Too much!

01:22:52.283 --> 01:22:56.447
I don't mind your dirty underthings in
public. I do, but I'm reconciled to it.

01:22:56.955 --> 01:23:00.118
You've moved into your own
fantasy world! You don't know...

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:02.290
- You have!
- Nuts!

01:23:02.627 --> 01:23:03.787
You can go on...

01:23:04.129 --> 01:23:08.463
Have you ever listened to your
sentences? You're so convoluted.

01:23:09.134 --> 01:23:11.466
You talk like one of your stupid papers.

01:23:11.803 --> 01:23:14.966
Actually, I'm rather worried about you.
About your mind.

01:23:15.306 --> 01:23:17.797
Don't you worry
about my mind, sweetheart!

01:23:18.143 --> 01:23:19.132
I'll commit you.

01:23:19.644 --> 01:23:20.576
You what?

01:23:20.979 --> 01:23:22.970
I think I'll have you committed.

01:23:26.818 --> 01:23:28.979
Baby, aren't you something?

01:23:29.654 --> 01:23:31.485
I've got to find a way to get at you.

01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:35.315
You've got at me, you don't have to
do anything, George.

01:23:35.994 --> 01:23:38.326
A thousand years of you
has been enough!

01:23:38.663 --> 01:23:39.652
You'll go quietly then?

01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:44.658
Do you want to know what's
really happened?

01:23:45.503 --> 01:23:49.496
It snapped! Finally. Not me, it!
The whole arrangement.

01:23:50.175 --> 01:23:53.338
You can go on forever and ever,
everything is manageable.

01:23:53.678 --> 01:23:57.512
You make all sorts of excuses:
“To hell with it, this is life.”

01:23:57.749 --> 01:24:00.013
“Maybe tomorrow he'll be dead.
Maybe tomorrow you'll be dead.”

01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:02.019
All sorts of excuses.

01:24:02.887 --> 01:24:04.582
Then one day...

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:07.417
...one night, something happens...

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.150
...and snap!

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.693
It breaks and you just don't
give a damn anymore!

01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:17.691
I tried with you, baby. I really tried.

01:24:18.536 --> 01:24:19.696
Come off it.

01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:25.372
You're a monster. You are.

01:24:26.745 --> 01:24:28.542
I'm loud, and I'm vulgar...

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.043
...and I wear the pants in the house
because somebody's got to!

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.051
But I am not a monster!

01:24:36.054 --> 01:24:37.043
I'm not!

01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:41.290
You're a spoiled, self-indulgent,
dirty-minded, liquor-riddled...

01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:43.720
Snap! It went snap.

01:24:44.395 --> 01:24:46.886
I won't try to get through
to you any more.

01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:51.001
There was a second back there,
when I could've...

01:24:51.236 --> 01:24:52.726
...gotten through to you.

01:24:53.371 --> 01:24:56.738
When maybe we could've out
through all this crap!

01:24:57.909 --> 01:25:01.572
But it's past.
And I'm not going to try.

01:25:01.913 --> 01:25:04.746
Once a month, Martha.
I've gotten used to it.

01:25:05.316 --> 01:25:10.049
We get Misunderstood Martha, the
good-hearted girl beneath the barnacles.

01:25:10.255 --> 01:25:13.588
The little miss that a touch of kindness
will bring to bloom again.

01:25:14.759 --> 01:25:18.422
I believed it more times than I'd admit.
I'm that much of a sucker.

01:25:19.097 --> 01:25:21.759
But I don't believe you,
I just don't believe you!

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.934
There is no moment any more
when we could come together.

01:25:26.271 --> 01:25:29.934
You can't come together with nothing.
And you're nothing!

01:25:30.441 --> 01:25:31.430
Snap!

01:25:33.111 --> 01:25:35.773
I looked at you tonight
and you weren't there!

01:25:37.282 --> 01:25:41.616
It finally snapped.
And I'm gonna howl it out!

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.610
I won't give a damn what I do.

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:47.447
And I'll make the biggest goddamn
explosion you've ever heard!

01:25:48.126 --> 01:25:49.923
And I'll beat you at your own game.

01:25:50.295 --> 01:25:53.093
- Is that a threat, George?
- That's a threat, Martha.

01:25:53.298 --> 01:25:54.663
You're going to get it, baby!

01:25:54.866 --> 01:25:57.130
Be careful, I'll rip you to pieces.

01:25:57.502 --> 01:26:00.630
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.129
Total war?

01:26:03.942 --> 01:26:05.239
Total!

01:30:16.127 --> 01:30:16.957
Bells.

01:30:21.466 --> 01:30:23.957
I've been hearing bells!

01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:26.801
Bells ringing.

01:30:37.648 --> 01:30:39.809
And I couldn't sleep for the bells.

01:30:43.754 --> 01:30:45.381
That woke me up.

01:30:45.823 --> 01:30:47.017
What time is it?

01:30:47.758 --> 01:30:49.191
Don't bother me.

01:30:52.997 --> 01:30:54.328
I was asleep.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:58.162
And I was dreaming of something...

01:30:58.836 --> 01:30:59.996
...and I heard the sounds coming...

01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:02.637
...and I didn't know what it was...

01:31:04.041 --> 01:31:05.474
...and it frightened me.

01:31:06.177 --> 01:31:08.008
I'm going to get you, Martha.

01:31:10.014 --> 01:31:11.504
Somehow, Martha.

01:31:12.683 --> 01:31:16.847
And there was someone there and...
I didn't want someone there.

01:31:17.355 --> 01:31:19.016
I was naked.

01:31:19.357 --> 01:31:21.188
You don't know what's going on, do you?

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:23.921
I don't want to know.

01:31:25.029 --> 01:31:26.360
Listen to them!

01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:28.694
- I don't want to!
- Look at them!

01:31:33.371 --> 01:31:35.032
I don't want any children.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.235
I don't want any children, please!

01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:42.702
I'm afraid. I don't want to be hurt.

01:31:45.216 --> 01:31:46.877
I should have known.

01:31:48.052 --> 01:31:50.543
Does that stud you married
know about that?

01:31:51.556 --> 01:31:54.719
How do you make your
secret little murders? Pills?

01:31:55.059 --> 01:31:58.051
You got a secret supply of pills?
Apple jelly? Willpower?

01:31:58.396 --> 01:31:59.294
Going to throw up?

01:31:59.497 --> 01:32:01.658
Where is he? I want my husband!
I want a drink!

01:32:01.866 --> 01:32:03.891
That's right, go at it!

01:32:04.735 --> 01:32:06.896
You know what's going on there?

01:32:08.906 --> 01:32:12.899
I don't want to know anything.
You leave me alone.

01:32:14.912 --> 01:32:15.810
Who rang?

01:32:16.747 --> 01:32:18.237
What were the bells? Who rang?

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:20.380
He's up there and you ask who rang?

01:32:20.585 --> 01:32:22.018
Someone rang!

01:32:26.357 --> 01:32:27.722
Someone rang.

01:32:30.761 --> 01:32:32.786
The bells rang and it was someone...

01:32:32.997 --> 01:32:34.157
Somebody.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.433
Somebody rang.
The bells rang and it was somebody...

01:32:43.608 --> 01:32:44.632
I've got it!

01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:47.337
I've got it, Martha!

01:32:47.945 --> 01:32:50.379
It was a message. The message was...

01:32:50.615 --> 01:32:53.948
...our son... it was a message...
The bells rang...

01:32:54.151 --> 01:32:56.312
...and it was a message.
And it was about...

01:32:56.954 --> 01:32:58.387
...our son...

01:32:58.623 --> 01:33:00.352
And the message was...

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.587
...our son...

01:33:04.929 --> 01:33:07.124
...is dead!

01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:10.164
Our son is dead
and I haven't told Martha!

01:33:10.468 --> 01:33:13.631
Our son is dead, Martha doesn't know,
and you won't tell her!

01:33:16.474 --> 01:33:19.807
I'll tell her myself.
In good time I'll tell her myself.

01:33:20.144 --> 01:33:21.475
I'm going to be sick.

01:33:22.146 --> 01:33:23.443
Are you? That's nice.

01:33:23.648 --> 01:33:26.981
- I'm going to die.
- Good, go right ahead.

01:33:35.993 --> 01:33:37.517
Martha, I have some...

01:33:38.195 --> 01:33:39.662
...terrible news.

01:33:41.832 --> 01:33:43.424
It's about our son.

01:33:45.436 --> 01:33:46.494
He's dead.

01:33:49.173 --> 01:33:50.697
Do you hear me, Martha?

01:33:52.843 --> 01:33:54.538
Our boy is dead.

01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:49.388
Where the hell is everybody?

01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:50.624
I'll give you bastards five to come from
wherever you're hiding!

01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:08.702
By God, you've gone crazy too.

01:37:11.041 --> 01:37:13.532
I said you've gone crazy too.

01:37:17.214 --> 01:37:18.545
Probably.

01:37:21.285 --> 01:37:22.650
You've all gone crazy.

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.246
I come downstairs and what happens?

01:37:34.798 --> 01:37:36.265
What happens?

01:37:40.738 --> 01:37:44.538
My wife's in the can with
a liquor bottle and she winks at me.

01:37:45.743 --> 01:37:47.074
Winks at me!

01:37:48.245 --> 01:37:50.076
She's never winked at you?

01:37:51.081 --> 01:37:52.912
What a shame!

01:37:53.918 --> 01:37:57.410
She's lying down on the floor,
on the tiles, all curled-up...

01:37:59.089 --> 01:38:02.525
...and she starts peeling
the label on the brandy bottle.

01:38:02.726 --> 01:38:05.593
Maybe she'd be
more comfortable in the tub.

01:38:08.599 --> 01:38:11.261
And I asked her what she's doing
and she goes...

01:38:11.602 --> 01:38:14.093
...”Sshh, nobody knows I'm here.”

01:38:16.774 --> 01:38:18.765
And I come down here...

01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:23.603
...and you're stumbling around going
“clink”, for God's sake, “clink”.

01:38:26.951 --> 01:38:28.782
You've all gone crazy.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:32.288
Sad but true.

01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:35.622
Where is your husband?

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.793
He is vanished.

01:38:44.802 --> 01:38:46.565
You're all crazy.

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:48.396
Nuts!

01:38:49.139 --> 01:38:52.973
'Tis the refuge we take
when the unreality of the world...

01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:55.642
...sits too heavy on our tiny heads.

01:38:57.815 --> 01:39:01.808
Relax! Sink into it. You're no better
than anybody else.

01:39:03.487 --> 01:39:04.818
I think I am.

01:39:10.628 --> 01:39:14.155
You're certainly a flop
in some departments.

01:39:23.507 --> 01:39:24.667
What'd you say?

01:39:26.677 --> 01:39:29.168
I said you're a flop
in some departments.

01:39:29.513 --> 01:39:31.174
I'm sorry you're disappointed.

01:39:31.849 --> 01:39:34.340
Maybe some time
when I didn't drink for ten hours.

01:39:35.519 --> 01:39:38.181
Baby, you sure are a flop!

01:39:39.356 --> 01:39:42.348
You're something. You know that?
You're really something!

01:39:45.129 --> 01:39:47.029
To you, everybody's a flop!

01:39:47.364 --> 01:39:48.854
Your husband's a flop, I'm a flop.

01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:50.188
You're all flops.

01:39:50.534 --> 01:39:54.368
I am the Earth Mother
and you are all flops.

01:39:59.543 --> 01:40:01.534
I disgust me.

01:40:09.053 --> 01:40:12.545
There's only been one man in my life
who's ever made me happy.

01:40:14.725 --> 01:40:16.556
You know that? One.

01:40:17.227 --> 01:40:19.058
The gym instructor or something?

01:40:22.399 --> 01:40:23.331
George.

01:40:26.403 --> 01:40:27.734
My husband.

01:40:28.238 --> 01:40:29.398
You're kidding?

01:40:30.574 --> 01:40:32.405
You must be. Him?

01:40:35.913 --> 01:40:37.244
You don't believe it.

01:40:37.581 --> 01:40:38.912
Why, of course I do.

01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:41.247
You always deal on appearances?

01:40:41.518 --> 01:40:42.746
For God's sake!

01:40:44.254 --> 01:40:47.917
George who is out
somewhere there in the dark.

01:40:49.259 --> 01:40:52.092
Who is good to me. Whom I revile.

01:40:53.597 --> 01:40:58.261
Who can keep learning the games we play
as quickly as I can change them.

01:40:58.936 --> 01:41:02.099
Who can make me happy
and I do not wish to be happy.

01:41:02.439 --> 01:41:05.101
Yes, I do wish to be happy.

01:41:07.377 --> 01:41:09.368
George and Martha.

01:41:10.447 --> 01:41:12.608
Sad, sad, sad.

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:17.952
Whom I will not forgive
for having come to rest.

01:41:18.622 --> 01:41:20.954
For having seen me and having said...

01:41:21.959 --> 01:41:24.450
...”Yes, this will do.”

01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:29.121
Who has made the hideous, the hurting...

01:41:29.466 --> 01:41:33.960
...the insulting mistake of loving me.

01:41:34.805 --> 01:41:36.636
And must be punished for it.

01:41:42.479 --> 01:41:45.312
Sad, sad, sad.

01:41:49.153 --> 01:41:50.142
Some day...

01:41:52.322 --> 01:41:53.482
...some night...

01:41:53.824 --> 01:41:58.158
...some stupid liquor-ridden night
I will go too far.

01:41:59.496 --> 01:42:03.489
I'll either break his back or I'll
push him off for good, which I deserve.

01:42:04.835 --> 01:42:06.826
I don't think he's got
a vertebrae intact.

01:42:08.338 --> 01:42:11.034
Oh, you don't?

01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:12.936
You don't think so?

01:42:13.844 --> 01:42:15.334
Oh, little boy!

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:19.672
You've got yourself so hunched over
your microphone...

01:42:20.017 --> 01:42:21.348
Microscope!

01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:24.017
Yes. And you don't
see anything, do you?

01:42:24.354 --> 01:42:27.016
You see everything
but the goddamn mind.

01:42:27.357 --> 01:42:31.691
You see all the specks and the crap,
but you don't see what goes on, do you?

01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:37.023
You know so little. And you're going
to take over the world, huh?

01:42:37.534 --> 01:42:39.024
I said, all right!

01:42:41.038 --> 01:42:43.029
The stallion's mad, huh?

01:42:43.373 --> 01:42:46.706
The gelding's getting all upset, huh?

01:42:47.044 --> 01:42:49.035
You swing wild, don't you?

01:42:49.379 --> 01:42:51.040
You poor little bastard!

01:42:51.381 --> 01:42:52.712
Hit out at everything!

01:42:53.383 --> 01:42:54.714
Go answer the door.

01:42:56.386 --> 01:42:57.546
What'd you say to me?

01:42:57.888 --> 01:43:00.379
I said go answer the door.
What are you, deaf?

01:43:00.724 --> 01:43:02.885
You want me to go answer the door?

01:43:03.227 --> 01:43:05.718
That's right, lunkhead,
go answer the door.

01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:08.755
Or are you too drunk to do that, too?

01:43:08.999 --> 01:43:10.523
There's no need for you to...

01:43:10.734 --> 01:43:12.167
Answer it!

01:43:12.769 --> 01:43:14.532
You be houseboy around here awhile.

01:43:14.738 --> 01:43:16.729
You can start in
being houseboy right now.

01:43:17.074 --> 01:43:18.735
Look, I'm no flunky to you.

01:43:19.076 --> 01:43:21.567
Sure, you are!
You're ambitious, aren't you?

01:43:21.912 --> 01:43:26.076
You didn't come back here with me
out of driven passion, did you?

01:43:26.917 --> 01:43:29.750
You were thinking a little bit
about your career.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:35.081
You can just houseboy your way up
the ladder for awhile.

01:43:36.927 --> 01:43:38.258
There's no limit to you, is there?

01:43:38.595 --> 01:43:40.859
No, baby, none. Go answer the door.

01:43:41.164 --> 01:43:42.631
Go on, git!

01:43:44.935 --> 01:43:46.425
Aimless. Wanton.

01:43:46.770 --> 01:43:48.931
Now, you just do as you're told.

01:43:49.273 --> 01:43:51.764
You show ol' Martha
there's something you can do.

01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:54.441
I'm coming, for Christ's sake!

01:43:54.778 --> 01:43:56.439
Wonderful! Marvelous!

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.544
Just a gigolo everywhere I go.

01:43:59.783 --> 01:44:00.477
Stop that!

01:44:01.118 --> 01:44:04.781
Sorry, baby. Now you go
answer the little door, huh?

01:44:13.931 --> 01:44:15.831
How lovely!

01:44:18.302 --> 01:44:21.794
Why, sonny, you came home
for your birthday at last!

01:44:22.272 --> 01:44:23.739
Get away from me!

01:44:24.308 --> 01:44:27.141
That's the houseboy, for God's sake!

01:44:27.477 --> 01:44:31.641
That's not our own little Sonny-Jim,
our own all-American something or other?

01:44:31.982 --> 01:44:35.975
I certainly hope not.
He's been acting awful funny if he is.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.151
I'll bet. Chippie, chippie, huh?

01:44:40.924 --> 01:44:42.915
I brung these flowers...

01:44:45.262 --> 01:44:46.593
...'cause youse...

01:44:47.397 --> 01:44:49.126
Aw, hell, Martha!

01:44:50.934 --> 01:44:55.598
Pansies, rosemary, violence,
mah wedding bouquet!

01:44:55.939 --> 01:44:57.600
If you don't mind, I'll get my wife...

01:44:59.142 --> 01:45:02.270
You stay right where you are.
Make my hubby a drink.

01:45:02.612 --> 01:45:03.943
I don't think I will.

01:45:04.281 --> 01:45:08.615
No, Martha. That would be too much.
He's your houseboy, not mine.

01:45:08.952 --> 01:45:10.943
I'm nobody's houseboy!

01:45:12.956 --> 01:45:16.915
I'm nobody's houseboy now

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:19.256
Vicious.

01:45:19.463 --> 01:45:20.953
Children? That right?

01:45:21.298 --> 01:45:25.462
Vicious children with their sad games
hopscotching their way through life?

01:45:25.802 --> 01:45:26.962
Something like that.

01:45:27.304 --> 01:45:28.134
Screw, baby.

01:45:28.472 --> 01:45:31.464
Him can't! Him too full o' booze!

01:45:31.808 --> 01:45:35.141
Really? Here! Dump these in some gin.

01:45:37.848 --> 01:45:40.373
A terrible thing to do
to Martha's snapdragons!

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:42.142
Is that what they are?

01:45:42.486 --> 01:45:46.650
Yup. And I went by moonlight to Daddy's
greenhouse to pick them for her.

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:49.823
There is no moon.
I saw it go down from the bedroom.

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.320
From the bedroom?

01:45:53.497 --> 01:45:54.657
There is a moon.

01:45:54.998 --> 01:45:57.489
There is no goddamn moon,
the moon went down.

01:45:57.834 --> 01:45:59.495
That may be, Chastity,
but it came back up.

01:45:59.703 --> 01:46:00.294
Bull!

01:46:00.504 --> 01:46:03.735
Once when I was sailing past Majorca,
the moon went down...

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:07.000
...thought about it awhile then,
pop, came up again.

01:46:07.344 --> 01:46:10.177
That is not true. That is such a lie!

01:46:10.514 --> 01:46:12.846
You must not call everything a lie.
Must she?

01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:15.341
I don't know when you people are lying.

01:46:16.019 --> 01:46:18.510
- You're damn right!
- You're not supposed to.

01:46:20.123 --> 01:46:24.025
- So, I was sailing past Majorca...
- You never sailed past Majorca.

01:46:24.528 --> 01:46:28.020
You were never in
the Mediterranean at all, ever!

01:46:28.365 --> 01:46:31.357
My mom and dad took me
as a college graduation present.

01:46:32.035 --> 01:46:33.195
After you killed them?

01:46:34.771 --> 01:46:35.897
Maybe.

01:46:37.374 --> 01:46:39.706
Yeah. And maybe not too.

01:46:40.377 --> 01:46:41.309
Jesus!

01:46:41.878 --> 01:46:45.541
Truth and illusion. Who knows
the difference, toots? Houseboy?

01:46:45.882 --> 01:46:46.712
I'm not a houseboy.

01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:50.349
You don't make it in the sack,
you're a houseboy.

01:46:51.221 --> 01:46:52.984
Then you must have made it, yes?

01:46:53.723 --> 01:46:58.057
Somebody's lying, not playing the
game straight. Who's lying? Martha?

01:46:58.895 --> 01:47:00.385
Tell him I'm not a houseboy.

01:47:02.365 --> 01:47:04.230
You're not a houseboy.

01:47:08.405 --> 01:47:09.394
So be it.

01:47:11.408 --> 01:47:14.241
Truth and illusion.
You don't know the difference.

01:47:15.245 --> 01:47:17.736
No, but we must carry on
as though we did.

01:47:18.915 --> 01:47:20.075
Amen.

01:47:21.918 --> 01:47:23.078
Snap went the dragons.

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:24.150
Thank you.

01:47:25.055 --> 01:47:25.953
Skip it.

01:47:26.256 --> 01:47:27.416
I said snap went the dragons!

01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:29.124
Yeah, we know.

01:47:30.093 --> 01:47:31.082
Don't!

01:47:31.428 --> 01:47:32.588
Don't do that.

01:47:32.929 --> 01:47:33.759
Shut up, stud!

01:47:34.097 --> 01:47:35.086
I'm not a stud.

01:47:35.432 --> 01:47:37.423
Then you're a houseboy. Which is it?

01:47:38.268 --> 01:47:39.929
Does it matter to you?

01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:43.762
No, actually it doesn't.
Either way I've had it.

01:47:44.608 --> 01:47:47.270
Stop throwing these damn things at me!

01:47:47.611 --> 01:47:49.806
- Either way. Snap!
- Shall I do something to him?

01:47:50.113 --> 01:47:51.444
You leave him alone!

01:47:51.781 --> 01:47:54.113
Which are you, baby, houseboy or stud?

01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:00.112
Truth or illusion, George?
Doesn't it matter to you at all?

01:48:03.126 --> 01:48:05.788
Snap! You got your answer, baby.

01:48:11.134 --> 01:48:11.964
Got it.

01:48:16.473 --> 01:48:18.805
You just gird your
blue-veined loins, girl.

01:48:19.309 --> 01:48:22.301
There's one more game to play.
It's called Bringing up Baby.

01:48:23.647 --> 01:48:26.639
I don't want a fuss. Don't want
any scandal around here, do you?

01:48:26.983 --> 01:48:28.814
Want to keep to your timetable?
Then sit!

01:48:29.486 --> 01:48:34.150
And you, pretty miss, you like fun and
games! You're a sport from way back!

01:48:34.491 --> 01:48:35.480
All right.

01:48:35.825 --> 01:48:37.986
Good. But we're not all here.

01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:42.320
Your little wifelet isn't here.

01:48:42.666 --> 01:48:43.997
She had a rough night...

01:48:44.334 --> 01:48:47.667
We can't play without everybody.
We need your little wife.

01:48:50.507 --> 01:48:51.496
Cut that!

01:48:52.509 --> 01:48:55.842
Just get off your butt and bring
that little dip back in here!

01:48:56.179 --> 01:48:59.171
Now be a good puppy, go fetch.
Fetch, good puppy.

01:49:09.459 --> 01:49:10.619
One more game.

01:49:19.135 --> 01:49:20.966
I don't like what's going to happen.

01:49:21.471 --> 01:49:22.802
Do you know what it is?

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.131
No. But I don't like it.

01:49:26.476 --> 01:49:28.137
Maybe you will, Martha.

01:49:29.479 --> 01:49:31.310
It's a real fun game.

01:49:31.648 --> 01:49:32.979
No more games.

01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:37.150
One more, Martha. One more game
and then beddie-bye.

01:49:37.487 --> 01:49:41.821
Everybody packs up his tools
and baggage and stuff and go home.

01:49:42.158 --> 01:49:43.853
And you and me...

01:49:44.394 --> 01:49:46.919
...we're going to climb
them well-worn stairs.

01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:48.824
No, George, no.

01:49:49.165 --> 01:49:50.496
Yes, baby.

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:53.996
It'll all be done before you know it.

01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:56.829
No climb stairs with Georgie?

01:49:57.173 --> 01:50:01.507
No more games. It's games I don't want.
No more games, please.

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:05.679
Sure you do. Original game girl!
Of course you do.

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.683
Don't you touch me!

01:50:11.454 --> 01:50:13.149
Keep your paws clean
for the undergraduates.

01:50:15.258 --> 01:50:16.247
Listen to me!

01:50:16.493 --> 01:50:17.824
You've had an evening.

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:22.556
You can't stop when there's enough
blood in your mouth. We're going on.

01:50:22.832 --> 01:50:26.529
I'm having at you, and your performance
will look like an Easter pageant.

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:28.098
Get yourself alert.

01:50:28.405 --> 01:50:29.895
- Get some life in you.
- Stop!

01:50:30.106 --> 01:50:31.368
Pull yourself together!

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:34.871
I'm going to knock you around
and I want you up for it!

01:50:35.845 --> 01:50:37.005
What do you want?

01:50:37.213 --> 01:50:39.044
- An equal battle.
- You'll get it.

01:50:39.249 --> 01:50:41.717
- I want you mad.
- I'm mad. Don't worry about it!

01:50:42.452 --> 01:50:44.545
Good girl!
We'll play to the death.

01:50:44.754 --> 01:50:46.551
- Yours?
- You'll be surprised.

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.221
Here come the tots. Be ready.

01:50:48.558 --> 01:50:49.547
I'm ready for you.

01:50:50.026 --> 01:50:52.358
Hip, hop. Hip, hip, hop.

01:50:52.562 --> 01:50:54.723
Are you a bunny, honey!

01:50:55.065 --> 01:50:57.295
- How's the bunny?
- Bunny funny!

01:50:57.734 --> 01:50:59.224
Bunny funny. Good for bunny.

01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:00.896
Honey funny bunny.

01:51:03.073 --> 01:51:04.438
All right, here we go.

01:51:04.708 --> 01:51:06.403
Last game. All sit.

01:51:07.577 --> 01:51:11.377
- Sit down. This is a civilized game.
- Just get on with it.

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:15.908
I think we've been having a real good
evening, all things considered.

01:51:16.252 --> 01:51:19.085
We've got to know each other.
And we've had fun and games.

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:21.254
Like Curl Up On The Floor.

01:51:21.458 --> 01:51:22.152
The Tiles.

01:51:22.425 --> 01:51:23.858
The Tiles, Snap The Dragon.

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.090
Peel the Label!

01:51:26.262 --> 01:51:28.253
Label. Peel the Label.

01:51:28.598 --> 01:51:30.088
I peel labels.

01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.268
We all peel labels, sweetie.

01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:35.594
When you get through the skin,
and through the muscle...

01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:40.103
...and slosh aside the organs, down to
the bone, you know what you do?

01:51:41.277 --> 01:51:42.938
When you get down to the bone...

01:51:43.279 --> 01:51:45.770
...you aren't all the way.
Something's inside the bone.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:48.277
The marrow.
That's what you got to get at.

01:51:48.785 --> 01:51:51.948
But bones are pretty resilient,
especially in the young.

01:51:52.288 --> 01:51:53.448
Now take our son...

01:51:56.126 --> 01:51:58.117
Our son. Martha's and my little joy.

01:52:00.230 --> 01:52:01.595
Just what are you doing?

01:52:01.798 --> 01:52:04.198
- I'm talking about our son.
- Well, don't.

01:52:04.634 --> 01:52:06.795
I want to.
It's important we talk about him.

01:52:07.137 --> 01:52:10.129
You want to hear about our
bouncy boy, don't you?

01:52:11.641 --> 01:52:13.632
Martha's and my son.

01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:17.477
You have a child?

01:52:17.814 --> 01:52:19.975
Yes indeed, do we ever!

01:52:20.316 --> 01:52:21.806
Will you talk about him or shall I?

01:52:22.018 --> 01:52:24.680
- Don't.
- All rightie, now let's see.

01:52:24.888 --> 01:52:26.651
He's nice, despite home his life.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:30.824
Most kids would be neurotic,
Martha carrying on the way she does.

01:52:31.161 --> 01:52:34.324
Sleeping till 4 p.m.
Climbing over the poor bastard...

01:52:34.664 --> 01:52:39.158
...trying to break the bathroom door
to wash him in the tub when he's 16.

01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:41.830
Dragging strangers
to the house all hours.

01:52:43.673 --> 01:52:44.833
That's enough.

01:52:45.175 --> 01:52:46.403
Do you want to take over?

01:52:46.743 --> 01:52:49.337
Why would anyone want to
wash a 16 year-old?

01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:51.010
For Christ's sake!

01:52:51.347 --> 01:52:52.439
Well, why?

01:52:52.649 --> 01:52:54.173
Because it's her baby-poo.

01:52:54.517 --> 01:52:55.677
All right.

01:52:56.019 --> 01:52:59.011
Our son, you want our son?
You'll have it.

01:53:01.858 --> 01:53:03.018
Do you want a drink?

01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:09.521
We don't have to hear it
if you don't want to.

01:53:09.866 --> 01:53:12.357
Who says? You in a position
to set the rules?

01:53:14.704 --> 01:53:16.194
Good boy. You'll go far.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.031
All right, your recitation please.

01:53:25.014 --> 01:53:26.106
Our son...

01:53:26.382 --> 01:53:27.314
All right!

01:53:28.384 --> 01:53:29.544
Our son.

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:36.048
Our son was born in a September night,
a night not unlike tonight...

01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:39.323
...though tomorrow...

01:53:40.163 --> 01:53:41.926
...and sixteen years ago.

01:53:42.131 --> 01:53:43.496
See, I told you.

01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:48.337
- It was an easy birth.
- No, you labored, how you labored!

01:53:48.738 --> 01:53:50.228
It was an easy birth!

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:52.837
Once it had been...

01:53:53.042 --> 01:53:54.407
...accepted.

01:53:55.245 --> 01:53:58.043
- Relaxed into.
- That's better.

01:53:59.082 --> 01:54:02.415
It was an easy birth,
once it had been accepted.

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.581
And I was young.

01:54:05.922 --> 01:54:07.685
And he was healthy...

01:54:08.758 --> 01:54:11.090
...a red, bawling child.

01:54:11.594 --> 01:54:13.960
Martha thinks she saw him at delivery.

01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:16.591
With slippery, firm limbs.

01:54:17.767 --> 01:54:21.601
And a full head of black, fine hair.

01:54:22.772 --> 01:54:24.103
Which, later...

01:54:24.774 --> 01:54:25.934
...later became...

01:54:28.011 --> 01:54:29.444
...blond as the sun.

01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:32.445
Our son.

01:54:32.782 --> 01:54:34.113
He was a healthy child.

01:54:35.618 --> 01:54:39.452
And I had wanted a child.
Oh, I had wanted a child!

01:54:39.789 --> 01:54:41.450
A son? Daughter?

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:42.780
A child!

01:54:47.797 --> 01:54:49.458
I had my child.

01:54:49.799 --> 01:54:50.959
Our child.

01:54:53.970 --> 01:54:55.403
And we raised him.

01:54:58.308 --> 01:55:00.299
Yes, we did. We raised him.

01:55:03.646 --> 01:55:06.809
And he had green eyes.

01:55:08.818 --> 01:55:12.481
Such green, green eyes.

01:55:13.656 --> 01:55:15.487
Blue, green, brown.

01:55:16.492 --> 01:55:18.187
And he loved the sun.

01:55:18.494 --> 01:55:21.930
And he was tan
before and after everyone.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.592
And in the sun...

01:55:26.502 --> 01:55:27.992
...his hair became...

01:55:29.038 --> 01:55:30.130
...fleece.

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:37.169
Beautiful, beautiful boy.

01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:45.351
So beautiful, so wise.

01:55:45.855 --> 01:55:47.345
All truth being relative.

01:55:48.358 --> 01:55:49.689
It was true.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:53.693
Beautiful, wise, perfect!

01:55:53.896 --> 01:55:55.523
There's a real mother talking.

01:55:55.832 --> 01:55:57.697
I want a child!

01:55:59.369 --> 01:56:00.358
On principle?

01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:03.194
I want a child. I want a baby.

01:56:03.706 --> 01:56:05.867
This perfection could not last.

01:56:06.876 --> 01:56:08.434
Not with George.

01:56:09.646 --> 01:56:10.977
Not with George around.

01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.647
There, you see, I knew she'd shift.

01:56:12.849 --> 01:56:14.510
- Be still!
- Sorry, Mother.

01:56:14.717 --> 01:56:16.048
Can't you be still?

01:56:16.886 --> 01:56:21.380
Not with George. A drowning man takes
down those nearest, and he tried.

01:56:22.058 --> 01:56:25.050
And, God, how I fought him!
How I fought him!

01:56:25.395 --> 01:56:26.726
The one thing...

01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:29.554
...I tried to carry unscathed
through the...

01:56:30.566 --> 01:56:31.897
...sewer of our marriage...

01:56:32.402 --> 01:56:36.065
...through the sick nights and the
pathetic, stupid days...

01:56:36.406 --> 01:56:39.739
...through the derision and the
laughter. God, the laughter!

01:56:41.077 --> 01:56:43.671
Through one failure after another.

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.914
Each attempt more numbing,
more sickening than the one before.

01:56:48.751 --> 01:56:52.084
The one thing, the one person
I tried to protect...

01:56:52.755 --> 01:56:57.249
...to raise above the mire of this vile,
crushing marriage...

01:56:58.094 --> 01:57:02.087
...the one light in all this
hopeless darkness! Our son!

01:57:02.298 --> 01:57:02.821
Stop it!

01:57:07.737 --> 01:57:09.204
Why, don't you like it?

01:57:09.605 --> 01:57:10.970
You can't do this.

01:57:11.174 --> 01:57:11.765
Who says?

01:57:11.974 --> 01:57:14.272
- I say!
- Tell us why, baby.

01:57:15.278 --> 01:57:16.768
Is this game over?

01:57:19.282 --> 01:57:21.273
Oh, no! Not by a long shot.

01:57:22.285 --> 01:57:25.118
I've got a surprise for you.
It's about sonny-Jim.

01:57:27.123 --> 01:57:28.613
I'm running this show!

01:57:29.625 --> 01:57:30.614
Sweetheart...

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.090
...I’m afraid I've got
some bad news for you.

01:57:34.297 --> 01:57:36.629
For both of us, I mean.
Some rather sad news.

01:57:37.567 --> 01:57:39.091
What is this?

01:57:39.302 --> 01:57:43.295
Martha, while you were busy,
while the two of you were busy...

01:57:43.639 --> 01:57:45.630
...I don't know where,
but you were somewhere...

01:57:46.142 --> 01:57:47.973
...while you were busy for awhile...

01:57:48.811 --> 01:57:51.507
...Missy and I
were having a little talk.

01:57:51.714 --> 01:57:53.773
You know, a chaw and a talk.

01:57:53.983 --> 01:57:55.746
And the doorbell rang.

01:57:55.952 --> 01:57:56.976
Chimed.

01:58:03.493 --> 01:58:04.824
It's hard for me to tell you.

01:58:06.462 --> 01:58:07.759
Please don't!

01:58:07.997 --> 01:58:08.986
Tell me!

01:58:09.999 --> 01:58:13.992
It was good old Western Union,
some little boy about seventy.

01:58:15.004 --> 01:58:15.936
Crazy Billy?

01:58:16.339 --> 01:58:17.829
That's right. Crazy Billy.

01:58:18.508 --> 01:58:20.999
And he had a telegram and it was for us.

01:58:23.012 --> 01:58:24.172
I have to tell you about it.

01:58:25.681 --> 01:58:30.015
Why did they bring it?
Why didn't they telephone it?

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:35.184
There are some telegrams you have to
deliver, Martha. Some you cannot phone.

01:58:36.492 --> 01:58:37.823
What do you mean?

01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:42.191
I can hardly bring myself to say it.

01:58:43.166 --> 01:58:44.292
You want to do it?

01:58:50.039 --> 01:58:54.533
Well, Martha, I'm afraid our boy
isn't coming home for his birthday.

01:58:55.378 --> 01:58:56.868
Of course he is!

01:58:57.713 --> 01:58:59.374
Of course he is! I say he is!

01:58:59.715 --> 01:59:00.545
He can't.

01:59:04.921 --> 01:59:06.149
Our son...

01:59:07.223 --> 01:59:08.212
...is...

01:59:09.792 --> 01:59:10.486
...dead.

01:59:12.228 --> 01:59:14.890
He was killed late in the afternoon...

01:59:15.565 --> 01:59:17.829
...on a country road with his
learner's permit.

01:59:18.034 --> 01:59:20.559
He swerved to avoid a porcupine
and drove...

01:59:20.903 --> 01:59:22.063
You can't do that!

01:59:23.072 --> 01:59:24.403
...into a large tree.

01:59:25.541 --> 01:59:27.031
You cannot do that!

01:59:28.711 --> 01:59:30.235
I thought you should know.

01:59:31.981 --> 01:59:33.710
You cannot do that!

01:59:34.050 --> 01:59:36.883
You can't decide these things
for yourself!

01:59:37.553 --> 01:59:39.384
I will not let you do that!

01:59:39.722 --> 01:59:41.383
Have to leave around noon, I suppose.

01:59:41.724 --> 01:59:43.749
I won't let you decide these things.

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:47.225
There are matters of identification,
arrangements to be made.

01:59:47.563 --> 01:59:49.724
You can't do this! I won't let you!

01:59:50.399 --> 01:59:53.232
- Get your hands off me!
- I haven't done anything!

01:59:53.569 --> 01:59:55.867
Now you listen to me. Our son is dead!

01:59:56.072 --> 01:59:57.733
Can you get that through your head?

01:59:58.741 --> 02:00:03.075
Listen carefully. We got a telegram.
There was a car accident and he's dead!

02:00:03.412 --> 02:00:06.074
Poof! Just like that!
Now how do you like it?

02:00:10.253 --> 02:00:12.244
Let her go.
She'll be all right.

02:00:23.432 --> 02:00:25.798
He is not dead.

02:00:28.271 --> 02:00:29.260
He is dead.

02:00:34.610 --> 02:00:36.942
You cannot decide.

02:00:37.947 --> 02:00:39.437
He hasn't decided anything.

02:00:39.782 --> 02:00:42.945
It's not his doing.
He doesn't have the power.

02:00:43.286 --> 02:00:47.620
That's right. I'm no god. I have
no power over life and death, do I?

02:00:49.492 --> 02:00:51.619
You can't kill him.

02:00:52.028 --> 02:00:54.519
You can't let him die!

02:00:59.435 --> 02:01:00.800
There was a telegram.

02:01:04.507 --> 02:01:07.806
Show it to me! Show me that telegram!

02:01:12.815 --> 02:01:13.804
I ate it.

02:01:15.151 --> 02:01:17.312
What did you just say to me?

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:20.982
I ate it.

02:01:24.327 --> 02:01:25.658
Good for you, Martha.

02:01:26.329 --> 02:01:29.264
You make a joke at a time like this?

02:01:29.465 --> 02:01:30.796
Did I not eat the telegram?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.833
You ate it. I watched you
and you ate it all down.

02:01:34.170 --> 02:01:35.159
Like a good boy.

02:01:36.772 --> 02:01:38.603
You won't get away with this.

02:01:40.843 --> 02:01:43.175
You know the rules, for God's sake!

02:01:44.513 --> 02:01:46.003
What are you talking about?

02:01:46.349 --> 02:01:47.680
I can kill him if I want to.

02:01:48.017 --> 02:01:49.075
He is our child.

02:01:49.285 --> 02:01:52.584
- You bore him. A good delivery.
- He is our child.

02:01:52.788 --> 02:01:54.016
And I've killed him.

02:01:56.392 --> 02:01:58.917
Oh my God, I think I understand this.

02:01:59.362 --> 02:02:00.294
Do you?

02:02:01.063 --> 02:02:04.362
- Oh my God, I think I understand this.
- Good for you.

02:02:09.138 --> 02:02:12.335
You've no right.
You've no right at all.

02:02:12.541 --> 02:02:17.001
I have the right, we never spoke of it.
I could kill him any time I wanted.

02:02:17.246 --> 02:02:18.907
Why?

02:02:19.215 --> 02:02:20.443
You broke our rule, Martha.

02:02:20.683 --> 02:02:24.244
You mentioned him to somebody else.

02:02:24.553 --> 02:02:26.384
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

02:02:29.925 --> 02:02:31.893
To me, you mentioned him to me.

02:02:35.064 --> 02:02:36.224
I forget.

02:02:37.566 --> 02:02:41.525
Sometimes when it's late night
and everybody's talking...

02:02:41.904 --> 02:02:43.895
...I forget and I want to mention him.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.902
But I hold on. I hold on.

02:02:48.277 --> 02:02:50.905
I've wanted to so often.

02:02:51.914 --> 02:02:53.905
But, George, you've pushed it.

02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:57.413
There was no need,
there was no need for this!

02:02:59.088 --> 02:03:00.919
I mentioned him, all right?

02:03:02.258 --> 02:03:04.749
But you didn't have
to push it over the edge.

02:03:05.594 --> 02:03:07.585
You didn't have to kill him.

02:03:15.604 --> 02:03:19.096
You didn't have to have him die.

02:03:24.814 --> 02:03:27.442
That wasn't needed.

02:03:57.146 --> 02:03:58.670
It's dawn.

02:04:00.249 --> 02:04:02.080
I think the party's over.

02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:09.651
You couldn't have any?

02:04:12.361 --> 02:04:13.589
We couldn't.

02:04:18.501 --> 02:04:21.299
Home to bed, children.
It's way past your bedtime.

02:04:32.281 --> 02:04:33.748
You two go now.

02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:49.861
- I'd like to...
- Goodnight.

02:05:17.026 --> 02:05:18.391
You want anything?

02:05:19.728 --> 02:05:21.218
No. Nothing.

02:05:27.036 --> 02:05:28.367
Time for bed.

02:05:35.077 --> 02:05:36.135
Tired?

02:05:36.512 --> 02:05:37.536
Yes.

02:05:38.847 --> 02:05:39.836
I am.

02:05:49.225 --> 02:05:50.749
Sunday tomorrow.

02:05:53.195 --> 02:05:54.389
All day.

02:06:32.034 --> 02:06:34.059
Did you have to?

02:06:36.105 --> 02:06:37.129
Yes.

02:06:41.977 --> 02:06:43.342
You had to?

02:06:49.985 --> 02:06:51.077
I don't know.

02:06:54.657 --> 02:06:56.852
- It was time.
- Was it?

02:07:08.170 --> 02:07:09.603
I'm cold.

02:07:12.174 --> 02:07:13.232
It's late.

02:07:25.788 --> 02:07:27.255
It will be better.

02:07:30.626 --> 02:07:32.059
I don't know.

02:07:33.195 --> 02:07:34.924
It will be. Maybe.

02:07:37.366 --> 02:07:39.197
I'm not sure.

02:07:48.043 --> 02:07:49.237
Just us?

02:07:53.716 --> 02:07:55.411
- You don't suppose maybe...
- No.

02:08:09.465 --> 02:08:11.126
- You all right?
- Yes.

02:08:16.972 --> 02:08:17.939
No.

02:08:23.078 --> 02:08:26.536
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

02:08:28.884 --> 02:08:30.215
I am, George.

02:08:33.922 --> 02:08:35.219
I am, George.

02:08:37.226 --> 02:08:38.318
I am.
