"Hap and Leonard."</i>

00:07.416 --> 00:08.250
You found the car!

00:08.410 --> 00:10.210
We'll take the money from the heist

00:10.300 --> 00:12.099
and start the corporation.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.088
You're gonna need to
bring your guns with you.

00:14.090 --> 00:15.707
Thought you didn't like my guns.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.655
<i>Police still have
no clues in the brutal murder--</i>

00:17.657 --> 00:18.500
Ugh!

00:18.501 --> 00:20.799
This whole town's
gonna be swarming with police.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.932
<i>Let's do this.</i>

00:23.632 --> 00:25.064
Shh-shh-shh.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.432
I'm lookin' for an answer, sugar.

00:27.434 --> 00:28.930
I just wanna be with you.

00:28.932 --> 00:29.766
Just you.

00:29.889 --> 00:31.720
We're takin' all the money.

Go on.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.432
Come on, get.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.599
You got your whole life ahead of you.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.266
We didn't intend to cut you out.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.099
There wasn't enough money
to go around.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.599
And this...

03:27.600 --> 03:31.199
Wasn't what we banked on.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.966
So this is plan B.

03:33.967 --> 03:35.766
And whose plan is that?

03:35.767 --> 03:37.266
We made a pact.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.999
There wasn't enough money
for our needs.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.232
We'd have to appropriate your share.

03:42.233 --> 03:44.966
Howard says it's just
a matter of priorities.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.199
Huh.
Oh, for a minute there,

03:47.200 --> 03:50.466
I thought we were just
getting screwed.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.299
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:52.300 --> 03:54.466
You want to keep that good eye,
keep your hand off my shit.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.099
Shut up!

03:57.100 --> 03:58.799
Does Trudy know about this?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.799
It's not personal, Hap.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.366
Oh, good, good.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.067
What is it, then?

04:08.567 --> 04:11.000
Sacrifice.

04:50.900 --> 04:54.199
Speed it up.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.066
At this rate,
we'll be here all night.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.367
Come on.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.599
Who the hell buries money anyway?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.999
Y'all been reading
too many damn caper books.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.166
With all these cops around,
it's called being smart.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.699
Maybe you two ought to
try it some time.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.099
If you're so smart,

05:13.100 --> 05:15.699
why are you burying this
in front of us?

05:16.967 --> 05:19.832
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.332
It's an awful lot of
rough housing for a peacenik.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.398
Now, look, you had that coming.

05:23.399 --> 05:24.865
Ow.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.199
Look, I never said
I was against violence.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.432
Sometimes the ends justify the means.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.099
All right?

05:30.100 --> 05:32.699
So why don't you come over
here and try that on me?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.032
Shove that gun so far up your ass

05:35.033 --> 05:38.232
you's taste gunpowder.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.767
Come on!

05:47.533 --> 05:50.732
Chub,

05:50.733 --> 05:53.733
put the box in the hole.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.800
Go ahead.
I got it.

06:13.267 --> 06:15.132
All right, Leonard.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.099
You fill it in.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.732
Pretend it's a rose bush
or something,

06:19.733 --> 06:21.499
whatever the hell you two do
for work--

06:21.500 --> 06:23.266
- they got fired.
- All right.

06:23.267 --> 06:27.166
Whatever--you know,
whatever you did for work.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.232
So this how y'all do, huh?

06:29.233 --> 06:32.232
All peaceful-like.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.666
Get your gun up.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.633
Hey.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.532
Look like you gonna
have to use that thing, Howard.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.632
Ever kill a man before?

06:45.633 --> 06:47.833
I did.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.133
Paco, fill it in.

06:57.433 --> 07:01.299
These fellers have stepped
in the wrong pile of shit.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.066
Let's not rub it in.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.799
They've been riding me
since they got here.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.366
If I'd have known I was coming...

07:06.367 --> 07:08.399
Hey.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.967
I'd have ridden you a hell of
a lot harder.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.199
This is everything.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.200
This is--this is the total.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.332
The rest is unusable.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.899
Well, it's--
it's not enough.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.699
If we're smart about things,
efficient,

07:54.700 --> 07:56.166
no more mistakes from here on out.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.466
Y'all already made one mistake:

07:58.467 --> 08:00.967
Pissing me off!

08:08.233 --> 08:10.932
You gonna use that, chub?

08:10.933 --> 08:14.699
Just let us do our thing.
We'll let you go.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.066
Howard doesn't want anybody
to know about us yet.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.599
You ain't got to worry
about me telling nobody.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.132
No, sir.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.832
Think I want the world to know
I got suckered

08:21.833 --> 08:24.132
by a bunch of idiots?

08:24.133 --> 08:27.432
What is this thing?

08:27.433 --> 08:30.366
You zip it, chub.

08:30.367 --> 08:33.000
Not supposed to say.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.466
Come on.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.633
Who we gonna tell, the couch?

08:55.467 --> 08:57.566
We're gonna buy some drugs.

08:57.567 --> 08:58.567
Oh.

08:58.568 --> 09:00.566
What, like, like grass?

09:00.567 --> 09:02.532
- Uh-uh, cocaine.
- Cocaine?

09:02.533 --> 09:03.932
<i>- Chub!
- Chub!</i>

09:03.933 --> 09:05.232
You stupid shit.

09:05.233 --> 09:06.599
All right, okay.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.266
What the hell does buying cocaine

09:08.267 --> 09:11.332
have to do with making
a difference to this world, huh?

09:11.333 --> 09:13.566
That wasn't part of
the big pitch you sold me.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.566
If we're gonna launch
a sustainable movement,

09:15.567 --> 09:19.732
we need sustainable income.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.099
They're gonna use cocaine
to fund their cause.

09:22.100 --> 09:27.099
How do you think the mechanics
survived as long as we did?

09:27.100 --> 09:30.432
By selling sweet Mary Jane
to college students.

09:30.433 --> 09:31.832
Cocaine's a bit different.

09:31.833 --> 09:33.699
- Don't you think?
- Exactly.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.032
- Who buys cocaine?
- Cokeheads, mostly.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.532
People who can afford it.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.366
It's a luxury drug.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.399
Consider us a luxury tax.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.099
We're gonna take it from the rich,

09:43.100 --> 09:45.032
and we're gonna use it
to help the people that need it.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.899
Like Robin hood.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.232
Last I remember, little John
didn't have no pager.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.932
Y'all just a bunch of goddamn
drug dealers.

09:51.933 --> 09:54.599
No, no, we use the system
to beat the system,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.332
and then we change the system.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.399
You can beat my meat and
preach about the system

09:58.400 --> 09:59.666
and the seals all you want--

09:59.667 --> 10:01.499
who said anything about the seals?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.666
What's with the seals?
Why does he keep saying that?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.232
Whales, elephants, whatever.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.832
You know what happens
to drug dealers, hmm?

10:06.833 --> 10:10.232
They end up in prison or in a ditch

10:10.233 --> 10:12.066
with a bullet in the head.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.932
Actually, that don't sound
like a bad idea.

10:13.933 --> 10:15.566
Paco's done this before.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.332
He's got the connections.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.033
Yeah, look at him now.

10:22.267 --> 10:25.066
They handle the traffic.
We handle the income.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.299
We stay clean.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.099
Yeah, and then we have the power.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.166
Power?

10:30.167 --> 10:31.999
You lost your drawers in the swamp.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.866
What the hell you gonna do
with any damn power?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.099
What makes you think we need
an economics lesson

10:36.100 --> 10:37.832
from two out-of-work
field hands?

10:37.833 --> 10:42.232
Technically, we're rosarians,
not field hands.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.066
You two ain't thought
this shit out, did you?

10:44.067 --> 10:45.532
Ignore him, Trudy.

10:45.533 --> 10:46.899
You might have saved
a couple of lives,

10:46.900 --> 10:48.366
but you're gonna ruin a bunch more.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.999
Think them drugs just gonna
reach the hands

10:50.000 --> 10:51.532
of some Hollywood big shot
or up the nose

10:51.533 --> 10:53.732
of some wall street scumbag?

10:53.733 --> 10:55.232
They're gonna end up on the street

10:55.233 --> 10:57.166
in the hands of some kids
don't even know

10:57.167 --> 10:58.167
what they hell they doing.

10:58.168 --> 10:59.499
Don't listen to him.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.032
He's just being derisive.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.266
- Oh, that's a big word...
- Quiet.

11:03.267 --> 11:05.199
For such a little asshole to fart.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.267
All right, that's enough.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.633
That was impressive.

11:21.267 --> 11:23.567
You rehearse that?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.032
Nice girlfriend you got there.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.366
Got more faces than a diamond.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.999
Okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.599
I admit that.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.899
That took me by surprise.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.299
And here we are,

11:42.300 --> 11:45.799
gun in face,
duct-taped to a chair.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.766
Mm, mm, mm.

11:47.767 --> 11:50.699
Glider.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.166
What?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.999
- It's a glider.
- It's my damn porch.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.599
- I know what it is.
- Just saying.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.100
You said enough,
talking me into this mess.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.033
- My nose itches.
- I don't care.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.532
Oh, shit.

13:33.533 --> 13:36.866
Shit.

14:14.433 --> 14:19.132
Maybe we didn't
think this through enough.

14:19.133 --> 14:23.200
It's a little late to start
second-guessing ourselves.

14:24.533 --> 14:27.433
I thought this was what we wanted.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.099
Of course it is, babe.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.399
Of course.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.666
I just want us to stay sharp.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.599
We've never done anything
like this before.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.800
Paco has.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.332
What if they're right?

14:45.333 --> 14:47.566
Don't let them get to you.

14:47.567 --> 14:52.666
We have to play the game
if we're gonna survive.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.866
I'm not letting anyone get to me.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.199
I'm just asking.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.332
All right.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.099
Is this who we are?

15:01.100 --> 15:03.032
It's like you say.

15:03.033 --> 15:06.267
"The right path isn't
always the easy one."

15:35.233 --> 15:37.832
I didn't know it was
gonna turn out like this, guys.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.732
I feel terrible.

15:40.733 --> 15:43.800
I'm really sorry,
for what it's worth.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.566
Do you want anything?

15:54.567 --> 15:56.766
I want to take back
saving your fat ass

15:56.767 --> 15:58.967
in the swamp.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.499
They don't respect you.
You know that, right?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.999
They see you, they see a
walking, talking pork chop,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.532
same as us.

16:10.533 --> 16:11.999
Only thing, they ain't gonna
slaughter you

16:12.000 --> 16:14.999
like they gonna do us.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.067
I'm not gonna let that happen.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.400
I understand your anger.

16:26.167 --> 16:29.133
You could never understand
my anger.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.833
Chub.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.500
Are we getting out of here?

16:46.167 --> 16:49.099
Howard said that he--

16:49.100 --> 16:52.699
he'll drop you guys off
at the state line tomorrow

16:52.700 --> 16:54.032
after we meet Paco's guy.

16:54.033 --> 16:56.132
Chub.

16:56.133 --> 16:58.167
Inside.

17:32.467 --> 17:34.799
<i>Dear Hap,</i>

17:34.800 --> 17:35.932
<i>it's been awhile.</i>

17:35.933 --> 17:37.999
<i>I know.</i>

17:38.000 --> 17:40.866
<i>I keep meaning to visit, but...</i>

17:40.867 --> 17:44.999
<i>I never have been great at life.</i>

17:45.000 --> 17:48.266
<i>I think of you often, though,
you in there,</i>

17:48.267 --> 17:52.866
<i>making a difference, dedicated.</i>

17:52.867 --> 17:57.232
<i>And me, out here,</i>

17:57.233 --> 17:59.399
<i>it's quiet, Hap.</i>

17:59.400 --> 18:01.232
<i>I keep thinking it'll get easier,</i>

18:01.233 --> 18:07.266
<i>but then I remember,
that's not how the world works.</i>

18:07.267 --> 18:10.899
<i>And I'm never one to sit still,
so I've decided</i>

18:10.900 --> 18:13.899
<i>to do something about it,
to try and make a difference</i>

18:13.900 --> 18:16.699
<i>of my own.</i>

18:16.700 --> 18:19.499
<i>I've moved to San Francisco.</i>

18:19.500 --> 18:23.799
<i>It's a long way,
but it really is for the best,</i>

18:23.800 --> 18:28.732
<i>for me, for the cause.</i>

18:28.733 --> 18:31.299
<i>I've joined a group of people
out here.</i>

18:31.300 --> 18:33.766
<i>We march and protest against the war,</i>

18:33.767 --> 18:36.332
<i>like we used to do.</i>

18:36.333 --> 18:41.066
<i>Feels good, you know,
to be a part of something.</i>

18:41.067 --> 18:43.366
<i>You know what they say.</i>

18:43.367 --> 18:47.532
<i>Some things are just meant to be.</i>

18:47.533 --> 18:49.766
<i>I've told them about you
and what you're doing</i>

18:49.767 --> 18:52.632
<i>to make a stand.</i>

18:52.633 --> 18:55.432
<i>I'm so proud of you, honey.</i>

18:55.433 --> 18:57.966
<i>I love you.</i>

18:57.967 --> 19:03.166
<i>Always did, always will.</i>

19:03.167 --> 19:05.000
<i>Trudy.</i>

19:18.967 --> 19:21.266
You smoke now too, huh?

19:21.267 --> 19:26.299
Boy, you are just full of surprises.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.499
Only when I'm nervous.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.899
Oh, you are.
Hey, it could be worse.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.700
You could be duct-taped
to a glider.

19:39.333 --> 19:42.532
Want to tell me what's going on?

19:42.533 --> 19:45.799
I would if I thought it would
make you feel better.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.066
Not too late to change your mind.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.066
Call it off.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.366
Let us go.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.332
Take your share and run away.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.666
You've done it before.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.799
I'm done running.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.132
This is my chance.
I'm taking it.

20:06.133 --> 20:09.499
No matter who it hurts?

20:09.500 --> 20:13.332
I gave you every opportunity
to be a part of this.

20:13.333 --> 20:17.866
You made your choice.

20:17.867 --> 20:21.199
Somebody always gets hurt, Hap.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.132
This time, the greater good
will win out.

20:25.133 --> 20:28.299
Greater good?

20:28.300 --> 20:30.732
There was a time when

20:30.733 --> 20:33.866
that meant protesting against wars

20:33.867 --> 20:38.000
and marching for equality, not this.

20:39.933 --> 20:42.632
You remember those two monks
who set themselves on fire

20:42.633 --> 20:44.132
to protest the war?

20:44.133 --> 20:46.432
Mm.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.299
I want that kind of dedication.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.166
Oh, they were dedicated, all right.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.632
They also got burned up.

20:53.633 --> 20:57.067
I need to believe in something.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.066
I've done a lot of things in my life.

21:03.067 --> 21:06.933
I've failed at almost all of them.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.467
I don't have another
failure in me, Hap.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.067
Even if it means this?

21:18.200 --> 21:20.233
Try and get some sleep.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.333
About time you woke up.

22:01.700 --> 22:05.166
We on speaking terms again, then?

22:10.300 --> 22:12.266
He came out here over an hour ago.

22:12.267 --> 22:14.232
Howard told him to keep an eye on us.

22:16.933 --> 22:19.132
Doing a pretty shitty job of it.

22:19.133 --> 22:21.633
You think?

22:23.567 --> 22:26.499
Let's go.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.099
Go?
Where?

22:29.100 --> 22:31.132
Let's get out of here.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.432
How?

22:32.433 --> 22:33.999
Get on your feet.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.599
We're gonna walk this thing
out to the woods

22:35.600 --> 22:36.766
and get it off us.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.366
Make a run for it.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.800
- You crazy?
- You got a better idea?

22:43.533 --> 22:45.166
Shouldn't we have
done this last night?

22:45.167 --> 22:47.632
I didn't think of it last night.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.466
Now, come on.
You with me?

22:50.467 --> 22:51.433
Okay.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.099
On three.

22:54.100 --> 22:57.367
One, two, three.

23:05.567 --> 23:07.232
Shh, shh, shh.

23:09.533 --> 23:11.166
You're going too fast.

23:11.167 --> 23:13.566
We're going too fast.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.532
You shut up.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.033
Just give me five.
Give me five.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.432
Come on, now we're making progress.

23:28.433 --> 23:29.666
Ready?
Let's go.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.666
Yeah, come on.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.366
Could we just slow down?

23:33.367 --> 23:34.599
You're tripping on my toes.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.932
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

23:35.933 --> 23:37.499
Stepping on my damn corn.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.966
- Just slow down.
- We ain't going slower.

23:39.967 --> 23:41.332
We're going backwards.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.566
Come on, this ain't so hard, is it?

23:43.567 --> 23:46.500
Looks pretty damn hard to me.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.332
Now, do you fellas think you can

23:54.333 --> 23:58.367
make it back to the porch
without falling?

24:04.500 --> 24:05.832
Oh, come on.

24:05.833 --> 24:08.032
Going.

24:20.067 --> 24:24.266
Well, I'm afraid you boys
are coming with us.

24:24.267 --> 24:25.966
After your great escape this morning,

24:25.967 --> 24:29.566
I can't exactly leave you
here with chub, can I?

24:29.567 --> 24:31.266
Cut 'em loose.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.633
Come on, chub.

24:38.933 --> 24:42.866
Thought I told you
to keep that thing on a leash.

24:42.867 --> 24:45.267
Does that mean
we're not friends anymore?

24:54.667 --> 24:55.933
Trudy!

25:05.467 --> 25:08.466
Trudy, come on.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.900
One good bounce, you'll blow
your pecker straight off.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.266
You're like a real bandito now.

25:43.267 --> 25:44.866
Just shut up.

25:44.867 --> 25:46.666
You've already gotten me
in enough trouble.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.899
My heart bleeds.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.000
Shut up, all of you.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.332
Who's got the money?

25:55.333 --> 25:58.332
I do, some of it.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.999
What do you mean, some of it?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.532
Look, Trudy and I talked it over.

26:02.533 --> 26:05.799
We're taking 5,000 as a deposit.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.866
A deposit?

26:07.867 --> 26:10.599
We're not going to a goddamn bank.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.566
This guy's expecting the money,

26:12.567 --> 26:13.599
all of it, up front.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.899
That was the deal.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.866
We have to know we can trust him.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.399
We have the money.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.232
If they want to make the deal,
we can get the rest.

26:21.233 --> 26:23.299
Dealers ain't exactly
the kind of people

26:23.300 --> 26:25.332
you want to get cute with.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.299
We got to go back.
We got to get the money.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.199
No, no, we're doing it this way.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.332
If it's not good for you,
we can turn around

26:32.333 --> 26:34.867
and forget the whole thing.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.533
We're driving
into a shitstorm, Howard.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.566
What the hell is that?

27:16.567 --> 27:18.200
She's our gang.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.666
Come on, let's move.

27:33.267 --> 27:36.099
How you doing?

27:36.100 --> 27:37.333
Hey.

28:02.867 --> 28:04.566
Hey, the revolutionaries.

28:04.567 --> 28:06.166
Que pasa?

28:06.167 --> 28:07.832
- How the hell are you?
- Well, we're here.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.032
We're all right, man.
We're all right.

28:09.033 --> 28:10.000
How are you?

28:10.001 --> 28:11.399
What is with salt and pepper?

28:11.400 --> 28:13.032
Huh?

28:13.033 --> 28:14.499
They helped us find the money,

28:14.500 --> 28:17.132
wasn't gonna cut them loose just yet.

28:17.133 --> 28:20.499
- So you brought them along?
- Mm-hmm.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.699
I love it.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.899
Yeah, hey, I'm Howard, man.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.499
I know who you are.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.766
You're the nerd or the professor
or some shit.

28:25.767 --> 28:27.266
Well, that's actually--

28:27.267 --> 28:31.132
and he's the self-help
gentle fellow.

28:31.133 --> 28:33.232
I met her at the diner.

28:33.233 --> 28:36.199
You look even lovelier
out of your uniform.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.966
And then she was married
to salt, right?

28:38.967 --> 28:40.032
That's Hap.

28:40.033 --> 28:41.432
And then there's your jig.

28:41.433 --> 28:43.432
- Leonard, yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.899
So we--we'd like to--
I'd like to deal quickly.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.399
Of course.
Yeah, of course you would.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.766
But first, let me intro--
well, ladies first.

28:49.767 --> 28:52.599
That shapely piece of meat is angel.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.332
My name's soldier.
Remember that.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.199
In case things don't go down
the way you like,

28:56.200 --> 28:57.999
you can come to me, and you can say,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.199
"soldier, I'm not happy
with the things went."

29:01.200 --> 29:03.932
And then I can say,
"tough shit."

29:07.100 --> 29:08.932
"Tough shit," I'll say
right to you.

29:08.933 --> 29:10.466
Okay, but enough of the pleasantries.

29:10.467 --> 29:12.799
Who's got the money?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.866
This was a bad idea.

29:14.867 --> 29:16.066
Paco, what is her name again?

29:16.067 --> 29:17.632
That's Trudy.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.999
Okay, so who's running things here?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.832
You know, if you let her
talk like that,

29:21.833 --> 29:23.999
I don't know, pretty soon
the Nig will be calling shots.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.699
Chaos.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.399
Well, excuse me, Mr. soldier,
his name's Leonard.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.799
You can call him anything
that you'd like.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.266
I do know a nigger when I see one.

29:32.267 --> 29:33.899
Hey, wait a minute, now.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.532
Sir? Sir?

29:35.533 --> 29:37.432
Hating a person because
the color of their skin

29:37.433 --> 29:38.699
is not gonna get anything solved.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.766
- Shut up, chub.
- Who's--

29:40.767 --> 29:42.132
you can't talk about someone
'cause the color of their skin.

29:42.133 --> 29:43.766
Who asked that to make sounds?

29:43.767 --> 29:45.299
Well, not everybody agrees
with the way he--

29:45.300 --> 29:46.267
hey, hey,
we'll talk about it later.

29:46.268 --> 29:48.032
But he used the N word.

29:48.033 --> 29:49.566
- We'll talk about it later.
- No, come on, now.

29:49.567 --> 29:50.832
Not everybody agrees with you.

29:50.833 --> 29:52.232
Not now, chub.

29:52.233 --> 29:54.232
No, you hold on a second.

29:54.233 --> 29:56.032
Just because he's black--he's
not allowed to use that word.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.033
Chub.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.766
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.699
Anybody shit their pants?

30:13.700 --> 30:15.932
I almost did right there.

30:15.933 --> 30:20.132
Paco, you really
caught me off-guard.

30:20.133 --> 30:22.532
Paco, we had a plan.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.032
Wasn't much of a plan,
was it, genius?

30:25.033 --> 30:27.032
You made a mistake when you
trusted a man

30:27.033 --> 30:29.266
who burned his own face off, I think.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.432
But no, there is no drug deal.
There's no drugs.

30:31.433 --> 30:34.266
There's just paco talking to me
about the easy money

30:34.267 --> 30:35.799
y'all were gonna find.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.066
Easy, my ass.

30:39.233 --> 30:40.499
Thought I was gonna die of old age

30:40.500 --> 30:42.132
waiting for you guys to find it.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.332
Paco, you're a piece of shit.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.666
Shh.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.232
I do like to hear myself
as I'm speaking.

30:49.233 --> 30:52.399
And shit is--it's a little
harsh.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.932
I mean, it's more like a
scrunched up piece of--

30:54.933 --> 30:55.999
what do they wrap candy in, baby?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.632
Cellophane, innit?

30:57.633 --> 30:59.266
That's the stuff your face
looks like, paco.

30:59.267 --> 31:00.366
Yeah.

31:00.367 --> 31:01.532
I mean, no offense.

31:01.533 --> 31:02.500
Fire will do that to a face.

31:02.501 --> 31:03.666
It's normal.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.332
And you should stop pretending

31:05.333 --> 31:06.932
like you're so noble.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.999
Where's all that '60s
free love shit now?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.566
You get a little taste of money,
and you screwed over

31:11.567 --> 31:13.799
the first two dudes you could,
and now I'm gonna

31:13.800 --> 31:16.199
screw you over, so...

31:16.200 --> 31:19.032
Bet that makes you two feel
a little bit better.

31:19.033 --> 31:22.799
Lenny? Just a shade?

31:22.800 --> 31:24.699
Even better if you
shot him in the foot.

31:24.700 --> 31:28.099
Hey!

31:28.100 --> 31:30.099
I like that.

31:32.733 --> 31:35.032
You're cool.

31:35.033 --> 31:36.932
- Ain't he cool, babe?
- He's cool.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.432
Aah!
Aah!

31:43.000 --> 31:47.532
That's just to let you guys know
I am a serious kind of guy.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.366
And now I would like
to collect the money,

31:49.367 --> 31:52.366
so who... Who's holding?

31:56.967 --> 31:59.766
We had a deal.
We had a deal.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.432
There is no deal.

32:01.433 --> 32:03.099
There's--the only deal
is you don't give me

32:03.100 --> 32:06.466
what I want, then I blow
your brains across the wall,

32:06.467 --> 32:08.099
and then I'll move down, and I'll get

32:08.100 --> 32:12.332
the black gentleman,
and then I'll end with her,

32:12.333 --> 32:16.532
and I will just spray those
titties all over this room.

32:18.533 --> 32:20.232
They didn't bring it.

32:20.233 --> 32:23.332
What did you say?

32:23.333 --> 32:24.866
There is money.
I saw it.

32:24.867 --> 32:26.799
$5,000.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.566
I...I have $5,000.

32:30.567 --> 32:35.432
We brought a deposit, a down payment.

32:35.433 --> 32:36.732
A down payment.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.066
Am I a realtor?

32:38.067 --> 32:41.332
We were being cautious.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.899
All right.
Okay, okay.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.099
Okay, okay, okay.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.099
So you're just not as stupid
as I thought.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.766
Where is the rest of the money?

32:50.767 --> 32:52.799
They buried it at Leonard's place.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.332
I know exactly where it is.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.366
Okay, well, I like that.

33:01.767 --> 33:02.767
So here's what we'll do.

33:02.768 --> 33:04.466
We'll, uh...

33:04.467 --> 33:06.799
You're gonna go fix--
you're gonna fix his foot.

33:06.800 --> 33:11.499
And then we will all get
the rest of the money together.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.166
Turn around.

33:17.233 --> 33:20.200
Angel, baby, I am starting
to like these folks.

33:29.367 --> 33:34.632
Howie, come on.

33:34.633 --> 33:37.332
Keep walking.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.099
That's radical.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.266
Keep walking, in the back.

33:42.267 --> 33:44.700
Holy--toys.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.899
- Hap.
- Uh-huh?

33:50.900 --> 33:52.766
Tell me about the beach
with them drinks

33:52.767 --> 33:55.200
with the little umbrellas
in them again.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
Going on a field trip.

34:15.933 --> 34:20.466
It's warm in here.
It's stuffy.

34:20.467 --> 34:26.599
This is a real piece of shit
van you brought, professor.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.866
Oh, it's hot.

34:31.433 --> 34:35.266
Hey, girl--what is her
name again?

34:35.266 --> 34:37.766
- Trudy.
- That's right.

34:37.766 --> 34:41.431
Tell me, which one of these
three desperados

34:41.433 --> 34:44.567
are you spreading your fine
little games for?

34:46.833 --> 34:49.166
My guess, my guess, whoever has

34:49.167 --> 34:52.266
the biggest ankle spanker,
am I right?

34:52.266 --> 34:53.799
Well, guess what?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.299
Size is not all it's
cranked up to be.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.498
Isn't that right, baby?

34:56.500 --> 35:00.199
- That's right.
- Yeah, see?

35:00.200 --> 35:03.932
Average depth of the
vaginal canal is only 6 inches.

35:03.933 --> 35:06.299
So I figure whatever doesn't fit in,

35:06.300 --> 35:07.766
you're wasting it.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.566
It's waste.
Ain't that true, baby?

35:09.567 --> 35:12.732
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

35:12.733 --> 35:14.399
Most women, they go for the gusto.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.466
They want the big salami
even though it's mostly

35:16.467 --> 35:17.899
just pumping air.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.632
I don't know, I guess it's
the as--

35:19.633 --> 35:21.232
- aesthetics.
- That's the stuff.

35:21.233 --> 35:25.166
Very American, very Texas, very...

35:25.167 --> 35:27.632
Bigger is better.

35:27.633 --> 35:33.799
So tell me, doodle, you banging
this handsome buck, hmm?

35:33.800 --> 35:37.299
Because we all know Nubian
brothers are hung like rhinos.

35:37.300 --> 35:40.566
Guess again.
He's a fudge packer.

35:40.567 --> 35:43.299
What?
Are you messing with me?

35:43.300 --> 35:45.533
You're messing with me.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.466
Well, you don't look gay.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.399
Bend over.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.367
I'll show you.

35:51.368 --> 35:53.400
Easy.

35:54.567 --> 35:55.966
It's good.
That's funny.

35:55.967 --> 35:57.199
He's funny.
He's a funny bunny.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.266
I like him.

35:58.267 --> 35:59.499
Isn't he funny, baby?

35:59.500 --> 36:02.366
He's funny.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.399
So then what about happy man here?

36:04.400 --> 36:05.999
Is he--

36:06.000 --> 36:07.932
do not tell me he's
a toot shooter too.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.032
Nope, he's so damn straight,
he's got a padlock

36:11.033 --> 36:13.032
up his asshole.

36:13.033 --> 36:16.832
They're friends.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.300
Well, ain't that special.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.099
A story I'd like to hear someday,

36:23.100 --> 36:26.599
but for now, which one
of these two gentlemen

36:26.600 --> 36:29.033
are you porking, then, trudes?

36:32.533 --> 36:34.766
Both.

36:34.767 --> 36:38.066
Oh, that is phenomenal.

36:38.067 --> 36:40.366
That is truly generous.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.399
That is so kind.
What about you, paco?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.032
Is she giving you a little something?

36:44.033 --> 36:46.432
She help you out with
a little southern comfort?

36:46.433 --> 36:47.899
No, of course not.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.932
And it's probably because
of the face.

36:50.933 --> 36:53.499
Well, it sounds like you folks
are having a good ol'

36:53.500 --> 36:54.966
time at the ranch.

36:54.967 --> 36:57.632
Me and angel, we don't--
we're not--

36:57.633 --> 37:01.799
she's a one-man woman.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.432
And she's enough woman for any man,

37:03.433 --> 37:05.232
ain't that right, sugar plum?

37:05.233 --> 37:06.233
That's right.

37:06.234 --> 37:08.267
Oh, baby.

37:10.100 --> 37:13.199
Hey, happy.
How'd you like to bang that?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.999
I'll tell you,
it is--it is quite a ride.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.299
It's fun.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.300
It's also very dangerous.

37:20.301 --> 37:23.299
Look at her shoulders.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.399
Bitch has a snatch like a bear trap.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.499
She'll tear your dick right off.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.133
She'll tear it clean off
if she wants to, gone.

37:33.867 --> 37:35.599
Not Trudy, though.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.666
No way, she's very, very different.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.632
I bet she's all soft
and warm on the inside,

37:40.633 --> 37:44.532
taffy-like, like dropping
into a hot chicken pot pie.

37:44.533 --> 37:45.932
You asshole.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.332
What?

37:53.333 --> 37:54.432
Thought so.

37:54.433 --> 37:58.066
I'm not afraid of you.

37:58.067 --> 38:01.232
Go ahead, shoot me.

38:01.233 --> 38:02.899
Make you feel like a big man.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.266
Shut up!

38:04.267 --> 38:05.366
He'll do it.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.932
He's gonna do it anyway.

38:08.933 --> 38:12.532
I won't give him the
satisfaction of being scared.

38:15.133 --> 38:19.732
Look, please, ignore her.

38:19.733 --> 38:24.599
She's always been a little
unstable and...

38:24.600 --> 38:26.499
She doesn't know what she's saying.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.899
Sounds to me like she knows
exactly what she's saying.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.599
No, she doesn't--look,
I don't feel that way.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.666
And I can see that
you're a business man, right?

38:36.667 --> 38:39.466
I can see that.

38:39.467 --> 38:42.066
And what I can also see
is that you're a reasonable--

38:42.067 --> 38:44.066
Howie, come on, she's...

38:46.067 --> 38:48.666
She has more balls than
you will ever have.

38:48.667 --> 38:51.766
She's got balls so big,
I bet Lenny wants a piece.

38:51.767 --> 38:53.466
Lenny?

38:53.467 --> 38:56.399
You get it?

38:56.400 --> 38:58.732
We got the cops.

38:58.733 --> 39:00.599
So what?
I love cops.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.033
Let's go.

39:33.867 --> 39:36.732
How y'all doing?

39:36.733 --> 39:39.132
Hey, officer,
my buddy caught his--

39:39.133 --> 39:40.699
sir, please slow down.

39:40.700 --> 39:41.999
He caught his toe in a drill press.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.500
I'm just taking him to the hospital.

39:46.267 --> 39:47.632
You all right, sir?

39:47.633 --> 39:49.366
Okay, yeah, I'm good.

39:49.367 --> 39:50.932
Buddy.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.532
We'll get you some help.

39:52.533 --> 39:53.866
Everything all right, Bobby?

39:53.867 --> 39:55.933
Yeah, I think so.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.266
Can you get back in the front
of the car please, sir?

40:02.267 --> 40:03.900
Of course.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.299
Have any ID on you?

40:08.300 --> 40:09.700
Of course.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.732
Something happen?

40:14.733 --> 40:16.432
No, nothing happened.

40:16.433 --> 40:19.433
Just a routine stop.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.599
Sir?

40:22.600 --> 40:25.199
Thank you, sir.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.633
Can I have your license
and registration please, sir?

40:35.967 --> 40:38.600
Please take your hood down, sir.

40:44.667 --> 40:46.799
Thank you.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.632
Industrial accident, factory fire.

40:49.633 --> 40:53.866
That sweet bastard went back
inside to save a cat.

40:53.867 --> 40:56.099
Cat made it out fine.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.499
I need to see everybody's
ID, please.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.432
Here you go, officer.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.766
Essential, baby.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.100
Essential.

41:24.333 --> 41:27.432
All right, now officer Bob
was a polite fellow.

41:27.433 --> 41:30.299
How are you, Jimmy?

41:30.300 --> 41:32.566
Okay, you're a family man.
I like that.

41:32.567 --> 41:34.266
And those are some handsome kids.

41:34.267 --> 41:35.532
Please...

41:35.533 --> 41:36.966
Huh?

41:36.967 --> 41:38.766
What, this?

41:38.767 --> 41:40.166
Please...

41:40.167 --> 41:42.432
Well, if you insist.
