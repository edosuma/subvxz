01:15.432 --> 01:17.885
Oh, customers,
how I hate them.

01:17.886 --> 01:20.212
Excuse me. I just heard that
before <i>Spider-Man</i> was a movie,

01:20.213 --> 01:22.770
It was a comic book--

01:22.771 --> 01:23.963
is that possible?

01:23.964 --> 01:25.663
What the...?

01:25.664 --> 01:27.869
suffering steve ditko!

01:27.870 --> 01:30.901
How can you not know
that spider-man

01:30.902 --> 01:33.665
first appeared
in 1962's classic

01:33.666 --> 01:36.118
<i>Amazing fantasy #15?!</i>

01:37.605 --> 01:39.565
Ooh, 12 cents!

01:39.566 --> 01:40.815
I'll take eight.

01:40.816 --> 01:44.799
What the...? You idiot!
Mint condition copies are, like, $40,000 each!

01:44.800 --> 01:49.507
Must lie down
On pile of unsold hulk hands.

01:49.508 --> 01:53.881
Hulk smash.

01:55.624 --> 01:57.927
Huh? What's this?

01:57.928 --> 02:00.593
"everyman"?
He's not a hero

02:00.594 --> 02:03.427
from marvel, dc,
Image or wildstorm.

02:03.428 --> 02:08.553
"it was a typical day
For delivery man avery mann until..."

02:08.554 --> 02:12.093
Help! Bank robbers!
Shut your yap.

02:13.173 --> 02:15.858
Time for this average man
to disappear.

02:20.312 --> 02:23.160
Look at that fat guy--
beatin' it like an egg.

02:23.161 --> 02:25.662
Yeah, he's scramblinin''
like an egg.

02:27.265 --> 02:28.577
Egg.
Egg.

02:28.578 --> 02:30.502
Laugh while you can.

02:34.692 --> 02:37.772
Everyman absorbs the
powers of every superhero

02:37.773 --> 02:39.790
Whose comic book he touches.

02:42.274 --> 02:44.724
Power-absorption power...
Absorb!

02:57.926 --> 02:59.448
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

03:02.886 --> 03:06.068
put me in sing-sing!
It's safer!

03:10.890 --> 03:12.357
Perfect.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.809
Plastic man powers--
absorb!

03:19.758 --> 03:21.169
Going somewhere?

03:23.573 --> 03:26.599
Everyman will stop
every crime every time.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.488
And I... Am... Everyman.

03:29.489 --> 03:31.903
Put my comic down.

03:31.904 --> 03:34.066
You made this?!
Shut up.

03:34.067 --> 03:37.548
No one is interested in the critical
judgment of a worthless child...

03:37.549 --> 03:39.354
Actually, I like it.

03:39.355 --> 03:42.923
You what now?
<i>Everyman</i> is awesome.

03:42.924 --> 03:45.219
Reading it, I escaped
from my troubles.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.257
Now they're back
in spades.

03:47.258 --> 03:49.225
Have you shown
this to anyone?

03:49.226 --> 03:52.859
No. If copies got out,
It would be ridiculed by the online community--

03:52.860 --> 03:55.155
Sonofsonofspock, thedorkknight,

03:55.156 --> 03:57.318
and ikilledkenny6475.

03:57.319 --> 04:00.315
Don't be afraid of them.
They're just lame-o's like yourself.

04:00.316 --> 04:01.489
Two of them are me.

04:01.490 --> 04:05.918
Very well.
I... Shall... Self-publish.

04:05.919 --> 04:08.898
How many issues
have you written?

04:08.899 --> 04:13.889
Oh, uh, just 335, including
the controversial number 289,

04:13.890 --> 04:16.296
Featuring the death
of marmaduke.

04:21.172 --> 04:23.388
Comic book guy's been
writing these for years.

04:23.389 --> 04:26.300
Who knew a troubled person
could be creative?

04:26.301 --> 04:29.027
Yeah, still waters
run deep.

04:41.883 --> 04:45.856
I'm so rich.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.148
All right, what's our next big
summer franchise? Come on.

05:05.149 --> 05:06.612
You want an original idea?

05:06.613 --> 05:09.251
Yes. Let your imaginations
run free.

05:09.252 --> 05:11.688
Something that's never
been a movie before,

05:11.689 --> 05:12.994
But feels like it has.

05:12.995 --> 05:14.639
Extension cords.
Mixed nuts.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.725
Car keys.

05:15.726 --> 05:19.917
Eh, we've already made everything
That could possibly be a movie into a great movie.

05:19.918 --> 05:21.377
There's nothin' left.

05:21.378 --> 05:22.816
Dad, can we go?

05:22.817 --> 05:25.068
I've watched all the dvds
in the bentley.

05:25.069 --> 05:26.842
Jonah, what's that
in your hand?

05:26.843 --> 05:29.920
Oh, big surprise that you
don't know what this is.

05:29.921 --> 05:33.740
It's only <i>Everyman</i>,
the coolest comic book ever.

05:33.741 --> 05:36.019
What are his powers?
All of them.

05:36.020 --> 05:39.603
That's it. Our next big summer movie
will be <i>Everyman</i>.

05:39.604 --> 05:41.804
Uh, marv? Ginormous pictures
bought the rights

05:41.805 --> 05:43.779
To <i>Everyman</i>
three weeks ago.

05:43.780 --> 05:44.780
Damn it!

05:49.744 --> 05:52.975
And think <i>Everyman</i> would
make a fantastic movie.

05:52.976 --> 05:55.955
Oh really? The way you thought
"stratego" would make a good movie?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.367
You'd expect us to believe

05:57.368 --> 06:00.256
That a red scout
would date a blue general?

06:02.984 --> 06:04.758
brett ratner had final cut.

06:04.759 --> 06:06.727
I'm well aware
of who had what cut.

06:11.514 --> 06:12.860
Let me get to the point:

06:12.861 --> 06:16.815
It is not money I am after, or women--
I know that is impossible.

06:16.816 --> 06:20.651
What I want is to pick the
actor who will play everyman.

06:20.652 --> 06:21.910
No can do.

06:22.593 --> 06:23.781
Thank you.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.960
But we never give...
Thank you.

06:25.961 --> 06:29.852
They'll laugh us out of hollywood.
Thank you.

06:29.853 --> 06:32.459
fine. You got it.
Thank you.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.605
I played hardball
with hollywood.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.782
The closest I will ever come
to playing a sport in my life.

06:42.149 --> 06:46.558
"wherever there's
a crime to be solved,

06:47.529 --> 06:48.827
"I will be there to solve...
...It."

06:48.828 --> 06:52.368
And there's more, but my fax machine
ran out of ink, so I can't read it.

06:52.369 --> 06:55.553
Do you know where you can buy ink
for an amiga brand fax machine?

06:55.554 --> 06:57.615
Thank you, that was great.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.994
You want to see it any other way?
Like sad...

06:59.995 --> 07:03.643
Or brooklyn,
or richard nixon voice?

07:03.644 --> 07:04.693
Pass.

07:04.694 --> 07:07.938
But I already bought a boat
with the money you were gonna pay me.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.508
Come on, comic book guy,

07:11.509 --> 07:14.814
you've gotta pick someone.
We've already read three people.

07:14.815 --> 07:17.752
Don't you lattÃ©-sipping
leeches understand?

07:17.753 --> 07:20.651
I've seen enough of these
hollywood super-hunks.

07:20.652 --> 07:23.698
We need a dumpy, unappealing
loser.

07:23.699 --> 07:25.045
-- an everyman

07:25.864 --> 07:28.816
Can you help me out?
I need change for a dollar.

07:28.817 --> 07:30.207
Oh, I also need a dollar.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.066
You... Are...

07:40.067 --> 07:41.182
Acceptable.

07:41.183 --> 07:43.032
Great. Do you want
to see me naked?

07:43.033 --> 07:45.342
Oh, there's no nudity in this movie.
What movie?

07:47.014 --> 07:48.871
Let's go around the table,
and everybody say

07:48.872 --> 07:51.697
One amazing thing that
happened to them today.

07:51.698 --> 07:53.376
Lisa?
Well, I qualified for

07:53.377 --> 07:55.266
the national math bee--

07:55.267 --> 07:57.800
Great. Marge, go.
Guess who the garden club

07:57.801 --> 08:00.366
Elected president?
You? Awesome. Next.

08:00.367 --> 08:02.894
No. I lost.
Eh, they can go to hell. Bart?

08:02.895 --> 08:05.749
Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid
isn't pumping out enough--

08:05.750 --> 08:08.915
Time's up. Okay, maggie: "suck,
suck"-- that takes us to... Me.

08:20.431 --> 08:22.095
Homer, we have
a problem.

08:22.096 --> 08:25.528
Fine. I'll give back the oscars
I stole from the lobby.

08:25.529 --> 08:27.686
Do you want the golden globe?
No! No...

08:27.687 --> 08:30.604
But we have a bigger problem.

08:30.605 --> 08:33.152
Homer, my brother and I
showed this picture of you

08:33.153 --> 08:35.422
To a cross-section
of typical moviegoers.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.818
Not one thought you
looked like a superhero.

08:37.820 --> 08:41.304
Several people
stared at the sun,

08:41.306 --> 08:44.957
Attempting to blind themselves.
Against every animal instinct they had.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.349
We need you to slim down, muscle
up and become the everyman

08:47.350 --> 08:49.378
People want to be instead

08:49.379 --> 08:51.432
of the one they actually are.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.935
I don't know if I can.
I'm a yo-yo dieter:

08:53.936 --> 08:57.194
"yo, hot dog man.
Yo, peanuts."

08:57.195 --> 08:59.975
Why aren't you laughing?
Don't you know what "yo" means?

08:59.976 --> 09:02.335
Maybe I can help.

09:03.231 --> 09:04.474
Lyle mccarthy.

09:04.475 --> 09:07.726
Finally, the answer
to my problem.

09:07.727 --> 09:10.824
What do you do?
He's the trainer to the stars.

09:10.825 --> 09:14.608
Here's what brad and angelina
looked like before they met me.

09:15.523 --> 09:18.160
They look good with a
little meat on their bones.

09:18.161 --> 09:21.085
Come with me.
Take my hand, homer,

09:21.086 --> 09:23.989
And wave good-bye
to fat you.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.360
Good-bye, fat me.

09:25.361 --> 09:28.500
You sure that guy who created
everyman's gonna like this?

09:28.501 --> 09:30.584
Him? He's gone hollywood.

09:33.603 --> 09:36.074
...A lot of people have come
to this town and changed,

09:36.075 --> 09:37.075
But not me.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.362
Now excuse me,

09:39.363 --> 09:42.664
I have to read a story
To my adopted cambodian orphan.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.194
Nannies, produce
the child and the story.

09:46.195 --> 09:50.040
Hello, prius--
give daddy a kiss.

09:53.161 --> 09:56.189
Homer, do you
know why you eat?

09:56.190 --> 09:59.137
Because I'm swallowing
my frustrations and disappointments?

09:59.138 --> 10:00.583
Something bad happens

10:00.584 --> 10:03.042
and you cope by cramming a donut
in your mouth.

10:03.043 --> 10:05.446
Yeah, well, you don't always
have time to...

10:05.447 --> 10:08.072
I'm gonna teach you
Healthy emotional alternatives

10:08.073 --> 10:09.129
to eating.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.390
We don't have much time,

10:10.391 --> 10:13.454
So we'll do it in a montage to
the song "eye of the tiger."

10:15.628 --> 10:17.340
Oh, that song's
a little on the nose.

10:17.341 --> 10:19.476
Can we do it to
david bowie's "heroes"?

10:19.477 --> 10:20.649
Eh, it's your montage.

10:28.119 --> 10:30.355
Whew... This montage sounds
really exhausting.

10:30.356 --> 10:32.800
How about I just do a
walking around sad montage?

10:32.801 --> 10:33.850
No.

10:33.851 --> 10:37.134
A montage of me turning a ragtag
little league team into state runners-up?

10:37.135 --> 10:39.209
No.
Me using funny modes of transportation

10:39.210 --> 10:42.432
Like a hot air balloon and a camel,
And finally a pickup truck full of chickens?

10:42.433 --> 10:45.229
Then I get out of the truck
and go to thank the driver,

10:45.230 --> 10:47.665
But then I see the driver is a chicken?
Let's just skip ahead a month.

10:50.973 --> 10:52.971
And... Fit.

10:57.168 --> 10:58.185
I gotta take this.

10:58.186 --> 11:01.079
<i>Tobey! Cider house rules!</i>

11:01.080 --> 11:02.664
Total wuss.

11:02.665 --> 11:05.182
Seabiscuit, you keeping
off the sugar cubes?

11:05.183 --> 11:06.771
<i>I hate this guy.</i>

11:06.772 --> 11:08.261
I love this guy!

11:08.262 --> 11:10.379
Tobe, tobe, tobe,
we talked about this.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.267
If the rice ain't brown,
don't chow down.

11:13.268 --> 11:16.034
Look, I gotta bail--
I'm with everyman right now.

11:16.035 --> 11:17.486
No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.

11:17.487 --> 11:18.823
He totally sucks.

11:18.824 --> 11:20.881
I'm only lying to him.

11:20.882 --> 11:23.229
Good-bye!
Bad-bye.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.850
Was that tobey maguire?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.435
Hey, home town buffet,

11:26.436 --> 11:29.776
like I told john travolta,
my client list is private.

11:29.777 --> 11:31.931
You know what?
Enough chitchat.

11:31.932 --> 11:35.225
Hit the pole!
Stripper up...Fireman down.

11:35.226 --> 11:42.991
And sexy.
Heroic!

11:42.992 --> 11:44.293
Earn that money.

11:45.378 --> 11:46.848
Found this
on the roof.

11:46.849 --> 11:50.355
Well, I think we've seen
the last of the purple pariah.

11:50.356 --> 11:52.937
Thanks, <i>Everyman</i>.
Don't thank me.

11:52.938 --> 11:54.629
Thank captain america

11:54.630 --> 11:58.103
<i>For giving me the patriotism
to want to save the president's life.</i>

11:58.104 --> 12:01.255
And thank wonder woman
for giving me the boobs

12:01.256 --> 12:03.175
to distract the guards.

12:03.176 --> 12:04.534
And... Cut.

12:04.535 --> 12:06.866
What'd you think, kids?
That was awesome!

12:06.867 --> 12:09.154
Although there were
a few holes in the story.

12:09.155 --> 12:11.355
That's the problem when
you have 17 writers.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.089
But don't worry, we have
two fresh ones working on it.

12:19.626 --> 12:22.379
Ooh, homie, take
your shirt off again.

12:24.643 --> 12:28.742
Oh! There's less of you to love,
But I love you even more!

12:30.090 --> 12:32.392
Aah! What was that?
Your other hand.

12:51.180 --> 12:54.340
Cut! Terrific.
Bring in the next helicopter.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.804
Awesome performance, homer.
I smell oscar.

12:59.805 --> 13:03.555
Oscar, take a shower,
or a tomato bath or something. Please!

13:04.426 --> 13:06.222
This life is the greatest--

13:06.223 --> 13:09.842
I get paid a fortune,
I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches,

13:09.843 --> 13:12.279
And I get to hire
my friends.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.216
At least you get to see
my face-- unlike carl.

13:15.217 --> 13:17.776
I'm being paid
to do what I love!

13:20.407 --> 13:24.980
A lot of things come and go in life,
But not fame and fitness.

13:24.981 --> 13:27.587
Homer! Homer sapian,

13:27.588 --> 13:30.078
can I have a word with you?
I know this is a bad time, but

13:30.079 --> 13:32.298
but
I'm leaving for another gig.

13:32.299 --> 13:35.653
Is that all this temporary
job was to you,

13:35.654 --> 13:39.305
a gig?
Don't take it personally, home team.

13:39.306 --> 13:41.829
But how will I keep
from overeating?

13:41.830 --> 13:43.925
Just remember
what I taught you.

13:43.926 --> 13:46.404
But you taught me the only people
who can stay thin

13:46.405 --> 13:48.524
Are those who can
afford

13:48.525 --> 13:50.422
$5,000-a-week
nutritional consultants!

13:50.423 --> 13:53.085
I've taught you well. Good-bye.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.944
Ooh! This other cheese cube
stuck to the first one.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.231
Well, that still
technically counts as one.

14:23.581 --> 14:26.835
Mm, it's bad luck to eat an
uneven number of cheese cubes.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.977
Don't look at me!

14:40.581 --> 14:42.627
Don't look at me!

14:42.628 --> 14:44.359
You, you watch.

14:47.986 --> 14:51.632
Avery, I swear, you're the
only man in gothamopolis

14:51.633 --> 14:53.661
Who's never seen everyman.

14:53.662 --> 14:58.001
Well, one thing's
for sure: I'm not <i>Everyman</i>.

15:02.977 --> 15:04.076
cut!

15:04.077 --> 15:07.249
This is a disaster.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this film.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.619
The star's overweight,
we're way over budget,

15:09.620 --> 15:11.532
And the grasshopperaptor
we built

15:11.533 --> 15:13.420
Seems to have developed
an evil mind of its own.

15:27.168 --> 15:30.561
Oh, marge, I'm ready
for some lovin'.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.721
Come and get me!

15:37.111 --> 15:40.857
Marge! Speak to me!
I think you may have put on a little weight.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.299
Nag, nag, nag!

15:44.304 --> 15:47.810
Apu, I have to lose weight now.
Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?

15:47.811 --> 15:50.045
Well, I don't know, I...

15:50.046 --> 15:52.574
Might have some milk
that has expired.

15:54.144 --> 15:56.837
Ah, here we are.
A delightful buttermilk

15:56.838 --> 15:58.411
from 1961.

15:59.244 --> 16:04.132
Oh, '61-- everyone was twisting again
like they did the previous summer.

16:12.697 --> 16:13.697
Uh-oh.

16:13.698 --> 16:17.056
Cleanup in aisles in three,
Two, one...

16:20.802 --> 16:22.302
And... Action!

16:24.368 --> 16:26.500
Ugh. What?
Cut.

16:26.501 --> 16:28.215
Where's homer?
In his trailer.

16:28.216 --> 16:30.629
<i>He won't come out?
He can't come out.</i>

16:35.230 --> 16:38.783
This film is an embarrassment
of jar-jarrian magnitude!

16:39.826 --> 16:43.132
As the writer, I demand
to express my opinion.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.987
Ooh, I'm afraid that's
not gonna happen.

16:44.988 --> 16:49.766
I see. Well, I respect that...
And vulcan death

16:49.767 --> 16:51.830
Hollywood ponytail yank!

17:11.095 --> 17:13.472
Ooh, I think we have
a clunker here.

17:13.473 --> 17:17.259
<i>And I should know-- I produced bad summer movie,
The parody of bad summer movies</i>

17:17.260 --> 17:19.650
that was itself
a bad summer movie.

17:19.651 --> 17:21.696
Don't worry, we fixed
everything with editing.

17:21.698 --> 17:24.941
Editing solves everything--
except my problems with the irs.

17:24.942 --> 17:26.242
Yeah, how's that going?

17:37.410 --> 17:41.291
Everyman...
Show your-ssself.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.918
I'm right here.
I've been here all along.

18:03.404 --> 18:07.595
Half the shots he's fat, half the shots
he's thin--It's taking me out of the moment.

18:07.596 --> 18:09.632
Like when you're kissing
a girl, and she burps.

18:09.633 --> 18:12.538
Who was in charge
of continuity on this picture?

18:12.539 --> 18:15.846
I tried to show them the
polaroids-- they wouldn't look.

18:15.847 --> 18:17.999
It's your job to get
their attention.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.021
Nobody takes
responsibility anymore.

18:20.022 --> 18:24.622
Well, I-I just wanted to get back
into the business after I had my kids.

18:24.623 --> 18:27.240
Yeah, well, now those kids have
an embarrassment for a mother.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.984
Home boy.
What happened, dude?

18:31.985 --> 18:34.735
You went from everyman
to everywhereman.

18:35.417 --> 18:38.494
What happened is, you left!
Who did you leave me for?

18:38.495 --> 18:41.376
Tell me--
I can take it.

18:43.319 --> 18:46.366
<i>Okay! It was turtle
from entourage.</i>

18:46.367 --> 18:47.920
I knew it!

18:50.099 --> 18:52.888
Come on, home run.
It's okay, home alone.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.328
Look, I'm sorry.
Let me make this up to you--

18:56.329 --> 18:59.212
I'll train you,
Then leave you again,

18:59.213 --> 19:03.552
then come back and train you.
It's how I make my money.

19:04.697 --> 19:05.776
Just you and me?

19:05.777 --> 19:08.365
You, me and turtle.

19:08.366 --> 19:10.205
That could work.

19:10.206 --> 19:13.872
He is a great guy.
He's an awful guy.

19:13.873 --> 19:16.312
<i>You just said both
those things to me.</i>

19:16.313 --> 19:19.516
I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry.

19:20.317 --> 19:22.565
Look, comic book guy,
about the movie,

19:22.566 --> 19:24.362
We know it's not great.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.159
Yeah, the projectionist
hung himself at the final reel.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.698
But you created everyman--your fans
will think whatever you tell 'em.

19:30.699 --> 19:32.741
If you put the word out
that this movie is good,

19:32.742 --> 19:34.702
We'll let you direct the sequel.

19:34.703 --> 19:37.360
You would let me direct
Everyman 2:

19:37.361 --> 19:38.670
Rise of the revenge?

19:38.671 --> 19:42.108
Absolutely! All you have to do
Is tell your army of internet dweebs

19:42.109 --> 19:44.509
to go see this movie.

19:44.510 --> 19:47.865
Hmm, sell my soul
for hollywood lucre,

19:47.866 --> 19:50.488
Or stay true to my lofty ideals.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.244
<i>Everyman</i>, the motion picture,
Is the combination

19:53.245 --> 19:54.815
of a life-long dream,

19:54.816 --> 19:59.295
And I was one of the few who saw
that dream realized on screen last night.

19:59.296 --> 20:02.905
If there is one fault to find
with this $200 million production,

20:02.906 --> 20:07.626
It is that this is the worst
movie ever!

20:07.627 --> 20:10.427
And send! And sip.

20:12.827 --> 20:16.306
Though legislation was passed
to ensure everyman was

20:16.307 --> 20:18.103
never seen on screens again

20:18.104 --> 20:21.967
<i>He remains in the hearts
of every man, woman and child</i>

20:21.968 --> 20:25.773
Looking for justice, or just hoping
to see bad people

20:25.774 --> 20:27.082
beaten up.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.818
I'm so cold.
