WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:05.039
Kevin, come in here.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.041
-I'm brushing my teeth.
-No. Now.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.276
What is it?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.677
There's a huge frickin'
spider up there.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.813
Well,
I'm in the middle of this,
so, you got it?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.116
Are you kidding me?
You're gonna make me do that?

00:15.183 --> 00:16.484
Honey, the thing's massive.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.651
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.952
-Massive? Come on.
-Come on.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.454
Come on, come on, come on.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.623
So --
Okay, well, just be careful.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.824
I will.
Okay. All right.

00:23.891 --> 00:26.560
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.663
Hands out of the cookie jar,
Donna, all right?
Ah.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.898
Time and a place.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.566
Well, I'm sorry.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.336
I'm only human.
Okay...

00:35.403 --> 00:37.205
Whoa. Whoa,
that thing is massive.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.707
That's what I'm saying!
Look at that. He's got abs.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.142
Yeah.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.176
Just do it.
Yeah.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.477
One good whack. You know?
Okay.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.045
But really get it.
Like kapow!
Yeah. Yeah.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.148
Smack! No mercy!
Hey, hey.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.949
I'll take it from here.
Okay?

00:49.016 --> 00:50.584
Here we -- here we --

00:50.651 --> 00:51.952
Okay, I nailed it.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.487
Ooh, where'd it go?
I don't know.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.689
Where'd it go?
I thought you nailed it.
I don't know.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.392
Donna, don't move.
What?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.361
It's in your hair. Don't --
Oh, don't be an idiot.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.196
Donna, it's in your hair.
[Mocking]
You're very funny --

01:02.263 --> 01:03.997
It flipped back --
it flipped back in your hair.
Oh! Oh!

01:04.064 --> 01:05.833
No, no, no!
What are you doing?!

01:05.899 --> 01:06.967
I don't know!
Why'd you throw it at me!

01:07.034 --> 01:08.836
Stand still!
Where is it? Ow!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.037
Okay!
Oh!

01:10.104 --> 01:11.505
I got it!
Donna! Donna!

01:11.572 --> 01:12.973
What are you,
a crazy woman?!

01:13.040 --> 01:14.975
I think I got it.
Oh, no. Oh.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.610
It ran under the bed.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.513
Okay. I'm out. That's it.
What?

01:19.580 --> 01:20.914
Where are you going?

01:20.981 --> 01:23.984
I'm not sleeping here.
He knows what I look like.

01:24.051 --> 01:28.822
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:30.524 --> 01:32.025
Oh, hey, honey.
You want breakfast?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.428
Uh, thinking about
going for a run.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.629
Okay.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.703
I thought about it.
I'm gonna have breakfast.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.473
No, no, no.
I'm gonna go for a run.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.874
You sure about that, Dad?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.309
Last time you went for a run,
you passed out,

01:48.376 --> 01:51.445
and Jack had to give you
a ride home on his bike.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.381
Yeah, you sat
on my handlebars.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.284
It still
doesn't ride straight.
Okay, all right.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.252
Hey, don't miss the bus.
I'll clear, okay?

01:58.319 --> 01:59.553
-Love you, guys.
-Bye.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.021
Yeah, you know what?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.456
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go for a run.
Okay.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.724
They say if you don't do
something

02:03.791 --> 02:04.992
in the first 20 seconds
of thinking of it,

02:05.058 --> 02:06.227
you'll never do it.
There you go.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.895
Ooh. I'm, like, a minute
and a half in.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.063
Did you make sausage?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.399
[Exhales] Morning.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.168
Hey!
Whoa. Look at you.
You look great.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.937
Thank you. It's for school.
I have a mock trial today.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.606
Death penalty case.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.940
-Ooh.
-Ooh. Well, go get 'em.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.575
I hope he fries.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.043
Actually, I'm defending him.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.680
Oh. Well, from what I hear,
he's guilty, so...

02:26.747 --> 02:30.284
Hey, um, have you guys
seen Chale this morning?

02:30.351 --> 02:32.152
That's weird. He wasn't
around last night either.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.356
What? You think he moved
back to England?

02:35.423 --> 02:38.692
No.
No, he's just been out a lot
lately these last few weeks.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.461
So where's he been?
I don't know.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.463
Well, have you talked to him?

02:42.530 --> 02:45.165
No, because our relationship
is built on mutual respect.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.100
Oh, boy.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.236
Kevin.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.303
What? I'm just sayin'.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.306
I'll find out what's going on.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.807
He might be running around
on her. You don't know.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.276
You put
the squeeze on the guy.
That's all.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.078
Dad, no. Chale is not out
running around on me.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.213
Of course he's not.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.081
Oh, please, girls.
Let's not be so naive.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.817
All right? I mean, British men
may row boats
and play cricket,

03:03.884 --> 03:06.086
but they're still men,
all right?

03:06.153 --> 03:09.323
Okay, Dad,
please stay out of this.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.092
Chale and I do not check up
or keep tabs, you know?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.994
We trust each other
unconditionally.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.029
Oh, boy.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.098
I promise you,
we're staying out of it.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.733
Okay? Right, Kevin?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.168
Yeah, all right.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.736
Thanks, Mom.
Okay, I gotta go.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.837
Love you guys.
Okay.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.373
Love you.
Love you.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.107
You find out what he's up to.
Do whatever it takes.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.175
Oh, I'm putting the squeeze
on him.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.378
I said whatever it takes.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.324
[Switch clicks]
Oh!

03:44.592 --> 03:48.028
What's up, pussycat?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.663
Mr. Gable.
What are you doing in here?

03:49.730 --> 03:50.898
Why don't you sit down?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.132
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.200
I want some straight answers,
you got me?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.602
Certainly.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.070
Last Tuesday night,
where were you?

03:57.137 --> 03:58.739
-Here.
-No. Tuesday.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.108
Here. Remember? We had tacos.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.876
No. That was Thursday.

04:02.943 --> 04:06.246
No. Tuesday. That's why
they call it "Taco Tuesday."

04:06.314 --> 04:07.848
That was two weeks ago.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.149
No, that was last week.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.452
What -- what's today?
Is today -- today the first?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.354
It's the third.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.155
Why is the date
on my phone wrong?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.457
Have you done the new update?

04:16.524 --> 04:17.725
No. I hate the stupid updates.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.226
I...I don't even do it.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.695
I'll do it for you.
It's quite easy.
[Groans]

04:21.762 --> 04:24.064
I can't stand that crap.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.633
Anyway, Kendra says
you haven't been around

04:25.699 --> 04:27.100
for the last few nights.
What's going on?

04:27.167 --> 04:29.269
Oh, I was hoping
she hadn't noticed.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.938
You've got a lot of apps
on here.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.606
Do you need all of these?
-No.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.107
I don't know
how they even got on there.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.175
Just get rid of them all.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.177
So what's happening?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.946
Well, every night,

04:39.012 --> 04:40.748
I've been working at
the mobile phone store

04:40.814 --> 04:42.115
at the mall.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.651
Actually, you know what?
That one I do wanna keep

04:43.717 --> 04:45.152
'cause,
you know what, it shows

04:45.218 --> 04:46.620
me the closest
deli in any city.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.958
And obviously, your daughter
means the world to me so, um,

04:51.024 --> 04:53.193
I have been secretly
saving money

04:53.260 --> 04:55.563
to buy her an engagement ring.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.066
[Exhales] Wow.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.436
I was way off.
Well, that's --

05:02.503 --> 05:04.438
Good for you, Chale.
You know?

05:04.505 --> 05:07.107
Actually, I th-- I thought
Kendra's whole thing was

05:07.174 --> 05:08.342
she didn't wanna get a ring.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.478
I know. She always goes
on and on about how

05:10.544 --> 05:13.347
she doesn't want a symbol
of patriarchal society

05:13.414 --> 05:15.315
resting on her finger.

05:15.383 --> 05:19.219
But I have learned that
sometimes women
say one thing...

05:19.286 --> 05:21.655
they mean the opposite.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.224
As a man who's been
married for 22 years,

05:24.291 --> 05:26.126
I gotta tell ya,
that ain't a rumor.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.595
[Chuckles] Here you go.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.463
Thank you.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.466
You know, it's funny, I guess
Kendra's just like her mother.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.201
You know, when Donna and I
got engaged,

05:34.267 --> 05:36.937
we didn't have a lot of money.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.239
So I got her a ring
as a placeholder

05:39.306 --> 05:41.241
with a promise to upgrade.
Ah.

05:41.308 --> 05:44.177
I bet when that happened,
she was really ecstatic.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.714
We'll see.
It hasn't happened yet.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.949
Oh...

05:49.016 --> 05:51.051
Does me getting Kendra a ring

05:51.118 --> 05:52.953
make things slightly awkward
for you?

05:53.020 --> 05:56.924
Like kind of a grisly reminder
of promises not kept?

05:58.325 --> 06:03.797
A little bit.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.298
[Announcer
speaks indistinctly
on TV]

06:05.365 --> 06:08.268
Wow. Chale really put you
on the spot, huh?

06:08.335 --> 06:10.904
No. Actually, he inspired me.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.641
I mean,
I promised Donna I'd buy
her that ring years ago,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.308
and she's just incredible.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.277
She -- she never brought it
up once.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.247
Just gotta figure out a way
to come up with 6 grand.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.150
[Cheering on TV,
announcer continues]

06:23.216 --> 06:24.317
Kyle, you been working out?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.653
You look like you dropped
some weight.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.788
Yeah, I don't have any money.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.290
Mott, you been working out?

06:30.357 --> 06:31.725
You look like
you dropped some weight.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.594
I don't have any money either.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.295
Just for the record,
both of you look like

06:35.362 --> 06:38.432
you broke out of fat camp,
okay?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.934
Well, don't you have any
savings or something?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.770
Yeah, I got savings,
but I can't touch it

06:42.836 --> 06:44.872
because she goes through
every bank statement.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.308
Well, just get the mail
before she does.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.043
Actually, you know what?
That --

06:50.110 --> 06:52.446
That might work because
by the time she founds out,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.515
she'll -- she'll already
have the ring.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.517
Well, lesson here is
when I get engaged,

06:56.584 --> 06:58.118
I'm gonna run out
and buy my girl

06:58.185 --> 06:59.520
the biggest rock
I can afford.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.188
I'm guessing it's gonna be
pretty gigantic

07:01.254 --> 07:03.757
considering you've been
saving for what? 50 years?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.259
52, and it's gonna happen.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.228
Hey, look, I'm waiting
to find Miss Right.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.632
Wherever she is, she's got
an unbelievable hiding spot.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.305
Hey, team.
Hey, morning.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.474
Ooh, wow, I'm impressed.
Going straight to breakfast?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.209
Not even gonna pretend
to run today?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.878
No. He's too sore from
pretending the other day.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.147
Boom! [Chuckles]

07:27.214 --> 07:29.316
Sorry, Dad.
It was teed up.
Yeah.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.450
Well, payback's coming.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.352
I don't know where
and I don't know when,

07:32.419 --> 07:34.321
but she's coming.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.323
Well, can you seek revenge
on your children

07:36.389 --> 07:37.457
a little bit later?

07:37.525 --> 07:38.892
You guys are gonna be late.
Bye.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.227
Bye. Love you.
Love ya.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.663
Hey, anything new with
the Chale thing?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.431
Oh, yeah.
I talked to him. He's --
Yeah?

07:44.498 --> 07:46.233
Totally clean.
Oh, good.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.802
Yeah. And he fixed my phone.
Yeah?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.370
Yeah, although he set my GPS.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.439
Now it talks like
Burgess Meredith.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.141
Yeah.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.375
[Imitates Burgess Meredith]
You're gonna make a left

07:55.442 --> 07:57.110
at the light!
[Laughs]

07:57.177 --> 08:00.313
You're fighting
bums and you --
while you're making a left.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.382
[Normal voice]
Yeah, he did. It's...

08:02.449 --> 08:04.652
Oh. Ooh, whoa. What is this?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.987
What?
Somehow $6,000 moved from
our money market

08:07.054 --> 08:08.421
to our checking.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.858
What are you looking at there?
Our bank statement.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.259
Don't those come in the mail?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.595
Well, not for eight years.
We do our banking online.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.330
But...

08:17.397 --> 08:19.166
somebody moved the money.
Did you do that?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.367
No. No.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.802
Oh, well, then I need
to call the bank.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.270
No -- [Stammers]

08:23.336 --> 08:25.405
Uh, did you say 6 grand?
Yeah.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.807
Oh, that --
that was me, then.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.508
Yeah, I thought
you said 60 grand, which --
No.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.410
But I was like...

08:30.477 --> 08:32.713
What, did somebody slip
at a supermarket

08:32.780 --> 08:34.514
and I didn't know about it?

08:34.582 --> 08:37.117
What were you planning on
doing with $6,000?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.219
I was gonna buy an ATV.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.422
What?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.424
Yeah. All-terrain vehicle.
I know what it is.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.626
It's a four wheeler.
It's like a quad.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.294
You can go up over hills,
little ones,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.696
and have fun in the backyard.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.430
Have the kids out there,
just --

08:50.497 --> 08:52.432
Okay,
I know what it is, honey.
But have you lost your mind?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.434
We can't afford that.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.436
Honestly, sometimes,
I feel like I'm married to

08:56.503 --> 08:58.338
a giant man-baby.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.140
I just thought
it would be fun.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.810
Well, so is living in a house
and paying our bills.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.712
Okay. Message received.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.446
But is it?

09:06.513 --> 09:08.849
'Cause I feel like we have
this conversation a lot.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.150
Hmm?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.652
Now that I know we do
our banking online,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.520
we won't have it again.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.056
Unbelievable.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.928
Mrs. Gable, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help overhearing.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.930
I wouldn't be too upset
with Mr. Gable.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.665
Well, I am.
He wants to use our savings

09:24.732 --> 09:26.333
to buy, like, a quad-runner.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.468
I don't think that's what
he's buying.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.937
What's he buying?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.605
Well, I'm not comfortable
telling you that.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.407
Mm.
Are you comfortable with me
calling immigration?

09:39.079 --> 09:42.482
Actually, I have a work visa.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.485
I am aware of the irony.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.487
Chale, just tell me.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.489
Okay. What?

09:49.556 --> 09:52.760
He's madly in love with you
and he wants you to know that

09:52.826 --> 09:55.195
by buying you a new
engagement ring.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.496
[Gasps]
Yes.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.565
What?
Yes, that's what
the money's for.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.100
[Chuckles]

10:00.167 --> 10:02.870
Oh! And I just yelled at him.
I called him a child.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.239
Actually, "a giant man-baby."
Oh, God, right.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.708
Ohh!

10:07.775 --> 10:09.777
That's the most thoughtful,
romantic thing

10:09.843 --> 10:12.746
he's done for me in, like,
20 years.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.983
And I told him not to do it.
Oh!

10:16.049 --> 10:18.786
And also, is 6 the number?

10:18.852 --> 10:22.890
'Cause, like...
10 sounds good.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.658
[Razor buzzing]
[Knock on door]

10:24.725 --> 10:26.827
Hey, babe?
Yeah?

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
I was just thinking,
and I feel awful

10:29.162 --> 10:30.664
for what I said down there.
[Razor stops]

10:30.731 --> 10:34.134
And I'm really sorry.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.470
No,
look, you -- you were right.
We don't need a quad.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.506
No. No, no, no.
You were right.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.541
You had a plan, and I think

10:41.608 --> 10:44.678
you should
follow through with it.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.179
Really?
Yes!

10:46.246 --> 10:50.550
If you wanna take a few
dollars and splurge on...

10:50.617 --> 10:54.054
an ATV, then you do it.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.557
Okay, if -- if I'm hearing you
correctly...

10:57.624 --> 11:00.127
Mm-hmm.
...you would be okay
with me taking

11:00.193 --> 11:03.563
a large sum of money
and spending it on... a quad?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.298
Yes.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.533
Then I will.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.835
Then it's a deal.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.179
Wait, a quick question.
Yeah, yeah?

11:19.246 --> 11:20.714
Are you drunk?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.649
No, but one thing --
if you need

11:22.716 --> 11:25.685
a little bit more than $6,000

11:25.753 --> 11:29.556
to get, like,
a really nice quad,

11:29.622 --> 11:31.959
then you should do that,
you know?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.660
I mean, go big or go home,
right?

11:33.727 --> 11:36.396
[Huffs] I mean,
I already am home,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.665
so might as
well go big, right?

11:44.437 --> 11:45.505
I just love that we can talk
things out like this,
you know?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.606
Yeah.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.608
Yeah. Communication.
It's so important.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.610
-Mm.
-Why are you
breathing so heavy?

11:50.677 --> 11:57.617
'Cause...
you take my breath away.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.919
You still gotta get her
the ring.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.088
It's the right thing to do.
You're not hearing me.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.623
Donna's exact words were,
"Buy an ATV."

12:03.690 --> 12:06.393
You want me to go behind
her back? Disobey her?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.628
To get her a ring that she may
or may not even want?

12:08.695 --> 12:11.498
Shame on you, guy.
Shame on you.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.866
Look, I thought you were
just trying to do

12:12.933 --> 12:14.367
something nice
for your wife.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.169
I was.
But then she wanted to do
something nice for me.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.604
So if you think about it,

12:17.670 --> 12:20.373
I'm actually putting her needs
before mine.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.509
Yeah.
You're a real angel, guy.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.444
It's kinda like
the man upstairs
is telling you

12:24.511 --> 12:25.745
forget about the ring,

12:25.813 --> 12:29.549
get yourself an ATV
that I can ride, too.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.219
Yeah, maybe, but by accepting
this miracle quad,

12:32.285 --> 12:35.188
I'm actually getting closer
to God.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.524
Yeah, especially if you
don't wear a helmet.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.792
All right, you know what?
You just made top of the list

12:38.859 --> 12:40.127
of people who can't ride it.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.694
Hey, if you're gonna have
a guilty conscience,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.096
don't come running to me.
Oh,
I'm not gonna come running.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.697
I'm gonna be riding up on
my brand-new quad.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.333
Whoo!

12:47.667 --> 12:49.069
[Music plays on TV]
This is fun. Date night.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.637
We haven't done this
in a while.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.705
No, no. We haven't.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.875
Yeah, you know,
it's just so tough

12:54.942 --> 12:57.444
because I'm always at school
or Enzo's working --

12:57.510 --> 13:00.680
Well, you know exactly
where I am. [Laughs]

13:00.747 --> 13:04.284
And lately, you're always, um,
where are you?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.820
Out doing my thing.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.122
Hmm. Clears that up.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.757
Okay, actually, it doesn't.
[Turns off TV]

13:10.824 --> 13:12.459
Where have you been?

13:12.525 --> 13:15.562
Whoa, uh, I thought that we
weren't gonna be one of those

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
clingy, possessive couples

13:17.230 --> 13:19.132
always checking up
on each other.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.700
Well, we weren't,
but now we are.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.935
Where have you been?

13:22.002 --> 13:24.104
All right, uh...

13:24.171 --> 13:26.706
I've been
at the cellphone store

13:26.773 --> 13:28.942
at the mall trying to make
some extra money.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.343
Extra money?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.080
All right, some money.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.918
Let's do this now.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.719
What? What are --
what are you doing?

13:42.089 --> 13:45.458
Okay, you -- you know you
already proposed to me, right?

13:45.525 --> 13:47.794
I know, but not properly.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.031
Chale, what did you do?

13:51.098 --> 13:53.033
Remember the antique setting
you loved

13:53.100 --> 13:54.667
when we were in Manhattan?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.103
I went back and got it.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.371
Now I feel like crap.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.142
Kendra June Gable,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.776
will you marry me?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.879
Yes. Yes. Well,
I already said yes.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.780
So yes,
I will still marry you.
[Laughs]

14:07.847 --> 14:10.117
[Inhales sharply]

14:10.183 --> 14:11.551
Oh. I love it.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.453
Oh, but, babe, I think
the diamond fell out.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.024
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
There is no diamond.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.226
Not yet.

14:19.292 --> 14:23.363
Turns out, diamonds --
wildly expensive.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.366
Well, it's different.
[Chuckles]

14:26.433 --> 14:28.868
I like to think it looks like
the two of us standing there

14:28.936 --> 14:32.472
with our arms outstretched
reaching for each other.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.176
Yeah, or a catcher's mitt
waiting for a fastball.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.812
I know it is not complete,
but it will be soon.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.648
Ow, what?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.083
No, it -- it jabbed me.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.920
The prongs are sticking up
where the stone usually goes.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.422
We can bend those down.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.226
[Groans]

14:53.293 --> 14:54.794
Hey, kiddo.
What are you doing up?

14:54.861 --> 14:56.796
Eating a bucket
of ice cream.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.198
What are you doing?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.800
Getting a spoon.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.269
What's the matter?

15:02.335 --> 15:05.738
Chale gave me
an engagement ring.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.841
Okay,
aren't I the one supposed
to be upset about that?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.610
Look.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.911
Ooh.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.413
Where's the stone?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.914
He hasn't gotten it yet.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.816
Okay, do you think it looks
like two people with

15:16.883 --> 15:19.786
their arms outstretched
reaching for each other?

15:19.852 --> 15:21.754
No. It looks like you punched
an 8-year-old

15:21.821 --> 15:23.890
and his braces got stuck
in your knuckle.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.627
So that's why
you're bummed out?

15:27.694 --> 15:30.763
No. No, I'm bummed out because
of the way I reacted.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.065
I just stared at it.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.833
Come on.
You reacted in the moment.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.568
You're a Gable.
That's what we do.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.971
You remember that Thanksgiving
when I was expecting onion dip

15:38.038 --> 15:39.439
and your aunt made it
with that yogurt

15:39.506 --> 15:41.108
instead of sour cream?

15:42.842 --> 15:46.046
I said some
pretty harsh words.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.614
Have you two patched things
up yet?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.983
No. She's a llama.
I can't stand her.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.489
My point is, you know,
Chale could've used that money

15:56.556 --> 15:58.591
and bought something
for himself, but instead,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.760
he did something amazing
because he loves me

16:00.827 --> 16:02.229
and he wanted
to make me happy.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.963
Just like if
there was something
you could do for Mom

16:04.031 --> 16:06.466
to make her happy,
I know you'd
do it in a heartbeat, right?

16:09.936 --> 16:13.340
Why are you dragging me
into this?
I didn't do anything.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.741
[Spoon clinks]

16:17.944 --> 16:19.879
Honey, you ready? Let's go.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.314
Yeah.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.883
Why are you so dressed up?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.452
I just wanted to look nice.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.986
You know, if you start out
looking at quads,

16:27.054 --> 16:28.988
you never know where
the afternoon might take ya.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.890
Okay, let's do it.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.759
Wait, uh, you're not
gonna change?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.894
Once I get this thing,
I'm riding it.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.465
Okay.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.968
I'll play your little game.
[Chuckling]

16:44.371 --> 16:46.539
[Gasps]
Oh.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.308
Wait.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.976
We're at an ATV store.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.612
Yeah, that's where you go
to buy an ATV.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.547
Hold it. Just --
So just one more time --

16:54.614 --> 16:56.916
We're actually here
to get an ATV?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.919
Babe,
I gotta say, for somebody
who does their banking online,

16:59.986 --> 17:01.988
you're a little slow
on the uptake.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.556
Oh, look at the green one.
Look at this one.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.857
Come here. Check it out.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.060
Stupid Chale. British idiot.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.461
This is it. This is
the winner right here.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.930
And guess what?
Only 8 grand. 8 grand!

17:10.997 --> 17:12.932
Oh,
this is actually happening.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.934
Oh, uh, but, honey, hey,
what about this one?

17:15.001 --> 17:17.937
This used one.
Right? Honey, it's cheap.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.972
What? Come on.
Go big or go home.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.541
Right. I said that.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.843
But I don't know, I mean,
look at this.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.146
I like it. Look, it's like
vroom, vroom, vroom!

17:26.213 --> 17:27.847
I'm quaddin' now!

17:27.914 --> 17:29.716
Right? It's fun.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.318
Stop fooling around.
Come here.
Check this one out.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.019
I want you to see it. Look at
the storage box on this one!

17:33.086 --> 17:34.821
[Groans]

17:34.887 --> 17:36.989
Fine, let's just get one
and go home.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.525
What's the matter?

17:38.591 --> 17:42.028
I don't wanna cry for reasons
I can't explain.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.563
I promise you're gonna
feel better in a second.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.332
Just sit on this one and check
out the storage bin.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.234
Check it out.
No, Kevin, there's something
I need to tell you.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.968
Well, you can tell me
and I will listen

17:49.035 --> 17:51.438
as soon as you sit here
and open the storage box.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.973
I don't want to!
I want to go home.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.041
Open the storage box!

17:55.108 --> 17:56.109
Fine!

17:59.179 --> 18:01.714
What in the Sam Hill?

18:01.781 --> 18:07.086
Oh! Somebody left
an engagement ring in an ATV!

18:07.154 --> 18:08.988
Wait, what's going on?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.857
A long time ago,

18:10.923 --> 18:13.092
I promised you a real ring.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.295
And I'm ready to make good
on that promise.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.864
Oh, it's beautiful.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.098
You like it?
I love it.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.501
Okay.
I love it.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.004
What's the matter?

18:25.071 --> 18:27.240
Nothing. I love it.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.443
That's not
your "I love it" face.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.545
It isn't, is it?
No.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.081
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but, uh...

18:36.516 --> 18:38.050
I think I love my old
ring better.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.086
What? It's a piece of crap.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.755
Yeah, I was there when
we had it appraised.

18:42.822 --> 18:46.025
But...
it's my piece of crap.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.495
You know, it's got baby food
and birthday cake

18:48.561 --> 18:50.029
and memories in it.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.064
That's the ring I was wearing
when I had to Heimlich you

18:52.131 --> 18:54.033
at the Red Lobster.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.404
It was Shrimp Fest.
I was tired of peeling.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.308
It represents us
and our amazing family,

19:01.374 --> 19:03.776
and there's no
ring in the world
that I would trade that for.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.645
[Exhales]

19:05.712 --> 19:07.079
Oh, no. No, no, no.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.449
You do it right
like you did it 22 years ago

19:09.516 --> 19:11.050
at the Jiffy Lube.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.420
All right, that was
super romantic, right?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.855
Hey, hey.
You were totally surprised.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.490
And you remember
everybody clapping?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.091
Even the guys
in the little pit
thing were clapping for you.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.295
Yeah,
but I think that's 'cause
they could see up my dress.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.598
Whatever, they still --
they clapped.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.068
Donna Gable,
you make me so happy.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.137
Will you continue
being my wife?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.339
Yes.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.374
And will you help me up?
My knee's locked.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.075
My knee's locked!
[Laughs]

19:36.142 --> 19:37.810
Aw! Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.279
Okay.
No, seriously.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.648
That is a noise a knee
shouldn't make.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.284
Sounded like someone
dropped a fork.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.620
What are you doing?

19:47.687 --> 19:51.391
Kevin Gable, will you
do me the honor

19:51.458 --> 19:53.092
of returning this ring

19:53.159 --> 19:55.127
and using the money
to buy an ATV?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.463
What? No.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.630
-It's what I want.
-No, no, no.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.731
-Please.
-No.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.700
Will you make me the happiest

20:00.767 --> 20:02.635
woman in the world...
Yes, yes, yes!

20:02.702 --> 20:08.708
A million times yes!
[Laughing]

20:08.775 --> 20:12.111
[Engine roaring]

20:12.178 --> 20:13.580
Whoo!

20:17.384 --> 20:18.885
Come on! We want a turn!

20:18.951 --> 20:21.588
Yeah, you've been hogging it!
Come on, who's next, huh?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.990
Huh? Oh! Come on, okay.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.725
Oh!
Ah!

20:27.560 --> 20:29.862
Sweetheart, you don't have to
wear it. Really.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.764
No, no. I love it.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.133
But just so you know,
I'm not my mom, okay?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.569
These arms are reaching out
for a diamond, not a quad.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.705
Understood.
[Screams]

20:38.771 --> 20:40.273
Come on, Dad, why don't you
get off that thing

20:40.340 --> 20:42.208
and go for a run like
you're always talking about?

20:45.211 --> 20:47.847
Boom! Told you payback
was comin'!

20:47.914 --> 20:49.582
[Engine roaring]

20:52.151 --> 20:55.221
* Don't want no
sweet perfume *

20:55.288 --> 20:58.925
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:58.991 --> 21:01.561
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:01.628 --> 21:02.895
* Do, do, do, do

21:02.962 --> 21:06.165
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:06.232 --> 21:09.369
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:09.436 --> 21:12.171
* I just don't want no...
