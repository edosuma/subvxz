00:45.195 --> 00:47.789
Guys! Guys! We're doing
a video for Cliff and Cydney.

00:47.897 --> 00:49.194
What do you want to say?

00:49.299 --> 00:52.530
<i>First the big studio sale.
Now the big wedding.</i>

00:53.269 --> 00:55.669
<i>MVP year for
our boy, Clifford.</i>

00:56.773 --> 00:58.798
<i>I fucking hate you, Anderson.</i>

00:58.908 --> 01:00.398
<i>Hey, and when
you're all famous,</i>

01:00.510 --> 01:02.603
<i>don't forget about your
crew from film school.</i>

01:02.712 --> 01:03.940
<i>Boys in the Wood Hood!</i>

01:04.047 --> 01:07.107
<i>You dance with who brung you,
Cliffie. You dance with who brung you.</i>

01:10.620 --> 01:13.145
<i>I mean, you know we wouldn't be
here tonight if it wasn't for me.</i>

01:13.356 --> 01:15.688
<i>I mean, I brought her to
that Black Eyed Peas concert.</i>

01:15.792 --> 01:19.421
<i>I introduced them. I mean,
I basically hooked them up.</i>

01:22.565 --> 01:23.964
<i>One,</i>

01:24.901 --> 01:26.198
<i>two,</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:28.398
<i>two and a half,</i>

01:30.607 --> 01:31.801
<i>three!</i>

01:51.861 --> 01:53.795
<i>And when he was
ready to propose,</i>

01:53.896 --> 01:57.354
<i>finally, I was the one that he
practiced on to get it right.</i>

01:57.934 --> 01:59.765
<i>So, you gonna
fuck him tonight, Rita?</i>

02:01.604 --> 02:02.969
<i>I already did.</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:12.973
<i>Can you... Can you
give me that please?</i>

02:17.453 --> 02:18.442
<i>Tommy...</i>

02:18.554 --> 02:20.181
<i>My little brother
getting married before me.</i>

02:20.290 --> 02:22.986
<i>Yeah, I wonder why. Come on.
Your armpit smells like ass, okay?</i>

02:23.092 --> 02:24.354
<i>Will you let the fuck off?</i>

02:24.460 --> 02:27.861
<i>I came all the way from Michigan
to do this one more time.</i>

02:27.964 --> 02:29.056
<i>How does that feel?</i>

02:33.369 --> 02:35.701
<i>Some of our friends did
the Kalalau Trail last year</i>

02:35.805 --> 02:38.137
<i>and came back with the
most amazing pictures.</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:39.970
<i>So they're going
to Maui, right?</i>

02:40.343 --> 02:43.608
<i>Kauai, the last island. Right...
Right there, number five.</i>

02:43.713 --> 02:46.409
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, right there.</i>

02:51.287 --> 02:52.413
<i>It's called
a dollar dance.</i>

02:52.522 --> 02:54.285
<i>In 1967 it was
a dollar dance.</i>

02:54.390 --> 02:56.824
<i>Please, get a 50.
Get out of there.</i>

03:05.968 --> 03:08.528
<i>I want you guys to know how
much I love you. I adore you.</i>

03:08.638 --> 03:11.198
<i>And I hope you have the
best time on your honeymoon.</i>

03:11.307 --> 03:14.435
<i>And make it something to
remember. Love you, guys.</i>

03:15.778 --> 03:18.372
<i>I think they just wanted to
start off their lives together</i>

03:18.481 --> 03:20.676
<i>with some kind of adventure.</i>

03:32.261 --> 03:33.319
<i>The red dot.</i>

03:33.429 --> 03:34.726
<i>There's the red dot.
The thing.</i>

03:34.897 --> 03:35.989
<i>You comfortable?</i>

03:36.099 --> 03:37.327
<i>Got the camera.
This should...</i>

03:38.101 --> 03:41.867
<i>Hey, can I ask you a
question, Mr. Cliff Anderson...</i>

03:42.338 --> 03:43.362
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:43.473 --> 03:44.701
<i>...of Venice Beach,
California?</i>

03:45.074 --> 03:47.599
<i>Yes, Mrs. Cydney Anderson,</i>

03:47.744 --> 03:49.609
<i>formerly Miss
Cydney Karswell,</i>

03:49.712 --> 03:52.237
<i>of Pacific Palisades,
California.</i>

03:52.782 --> 03:55.342
<i>How did you
get this scar?</i>

03:55.451 --> 03:58.079
<i>Oh, my God, I can't believe
I didn't notice it before.</i>

03:59.756 --> 04:01.314
<i>That's a long story</i>

04:01.424 --> 04:06.828
<i>and it involves
Homeland Security.</i>

04:08.798 --> 04:12.199
<i>It's not funny. And me
being unexpectedly pressed</i>

04:12.301 --> 04:14.462
<i>into service as
a deputy air marshal.</i>

04:14.570 --> 04:16.367
<i>And I don't really
want to talk about it.</i>

04:16.539 --> 04:21.067
<i>Try again! A little
less grandiose, thank you.</i>

04:21.810 --> 04:24.780
<i>My brother hit me with his
skateboard when I was nine.</i>

04:25.047 --> 04:26.674
<i>Wait,
which brother is this?</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:29.044
<i>That would be Tommy,
the dick, from Michigan.</i>

04:29.152 --> 04:30.585
<i>Oh.</i>

04:30.820 --> 04:33.618
<i>Wait, I thought he said
Maryland at the wedding.</i>

04:33.723 --> 04:36.385
<i>Excuse me,
but whose brother is this?</i>

04:36.559 --> 04:40.962
<i>I'm so sorry! He's
got, like, 16 brothers, okay?</i>

04:41.397 --> 04:42.887
<i>All right,
Tommy from Michigan.</i>

04:42.999 --> 04:44.057
<i>A new wife should
know these things.</i>

04:44.167 --> 04:45.794
Feet in! Feet in! Feet in!

04:48.137 --> 04:49.900
Christ! Are you insane?

04:50.006 --> 04:51.496
It's a rental.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.672
Mrs. Cydney Anderson.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.576
Mrs. Cydney... No,
Mrs. Cydney... Listen.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.583
You know, it's like
writing checks in January.

05:02.685 --> 05:04.175
I know
I'm going to blow it.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.448
<i>You got to keep practicing.</i>

05:16.632 --> 05:18.793
Cliff, get back
in here! God!

05:19.168 --> 05:21.466
I've never seen so many shades of green!

05:21.571 --> 05:23.766
Hey, hey!
Get a picture of me!

05:27.910 --> 05:29.172
Hey, hey!

05:30.746 --> 05:31.872
Stop it!

05:42.158 --> 05:43.489
Look! Look!

05:49.232 --> 05:50.529
Oh! Whoa!

06:00.009 --> 06:02.204
Hey, hey!
Look, look! Trekkers!

06:02.311 --> 06:03.539
Hey!
Hi!

06:06.415 --> 06:11.045
Hey! Hey, I want to do that!
Kalalau, that trail right down there!

06:11.153 --> 06:13.087
Did it myself
back in the day.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.851
I'll show you
what it's all for.

06:23.032 --> 06:25.728
The most gorgeous dead end
God ever made.

06:27.036 --> 06:28.401
Wow!

06:28.838 --> 06:29.805
Yeah!

06:29.906 --> 06:31.203
You know what?
Drop me off right here.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.296
Forget the hike.

06:32.408 --> 06:34.535
Only two ways
in and out, Cydney.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.612
By foot or by kayak.

06:37.346 --> 06:39.837
But that's what
makes it so special.

07:23.125 --> 07:26.617
Well, beautiful it is,
brother. How many days you allow?

07:26.963 --> 07:29.659
About one day in, one day at the
beach and then another day back.

07:29.765 --> 07:32.233
Common mistake.

07:32.435 --> 07:33.732
What, you think
I need more?

07:33.836 --> 07:36.430
I don't know if you need more,
but you'll sure want more.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.006
As long as all your
permits are updated

07:38.107 --> 07:39.597
and so on.
Yeah, yeah. See?

07:41.376 --> 07:43.970
Okay. Yeah. 'Cause the rangers
do get out and work the trail.

07:44.078 --> 07:45.102
So, you want to keep
these close, Cliff.

07:45.213 --> 07:46.180
All right.

07:46.314 --> 07:47.747
And this, too.

07:50.551 --> 07:51.518
Did you miss me?

07:51.619 --> 07:53.086
You know, three days
sounds plenty to me.

07:58.860 --> 08:01.090
Nine whole minutes.

08:01.529 --> 08:02.655
Do you realize

08:02.764 --> 08:05.528
that's the longest we've been
apart since we got married?

08:05.633 --> 08:07.601
You must have missed
me something awful.

08:07.702 --> 08:10.398
This is 11.5 miles
each way, right?

08:10.505 --> 08:11.665
Each way.

08:11.773 --> 08:13.263
Tell me you missed me.

08:13.374 --> 08:14.363
Well...

08:15.143 --> 08:16.906
I'll give you
a BJ in the car.

08:17.011 --> 08:18.000
Okay.

08:18.112 --> 08:19.511
Another one.

08:22.650 --> 08:23.844
Anyways,
check this out, Cliff.

08:23.951 --> 08:26.112
Now you gonna cross
over five valleys.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.209
Each time you do,

08:27.321 --> 08:30.017
you're gonna gain or lose
1,000 feet of elevation.

08:30.124 --> 08:31.216
That's the killer.

08:31.325 --> 08:32.815
I missed you, too, baby.

08:32.927 --> 08:35.327
What?
Did you go somewhere?

08:35.429 --> 08:37.193
You're so bad!

08:37.298 --> 08:39.265
$475.35.

08:39.366 --> 08:40.390
All right.

08:41.135 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, I know. It looks
like I robbed a bank.

08:43.104 --> 08:45.572
It's our wedding haul!

08:45.673 --> 08:46.935
What's up? What's up?

08:48.242 --> 08:50.039
- How's my baby boy?
- Back from Oahu?

08:50.244 --> 08:51.211
Glad to see you back.

08:51.312 --> 08:52.472
Nowhere near
Honolulu, were you?

08:52.580 --> 08:55.071
No, on the other side. Waves
were junk for three days.

08:55.183 --> 08:58.584
More better over here. Why?
What's the stink in 'Lulu?

08:59.120 --> 09:03.352
Maybe enough for now. Want to
help these two out to their car?

09:03.458 --> 09:06.188
Yeah, I'll just dump my gear.
I'll be right with them.

09:06.294 --> 09:08.762
Boy's gonna help
with your bags.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.564
Get an early
start, brother.

09:13.668 --> 09:14.794
Yeah, I will.

09:46.501 --> 09:48.230
<i>...never falter</i>

09:48.803 --> 09:53.069
<i>I need your love
each and every day</i>

09:56.777 --> 09:58.039
<i>All right</i>

10:02.650 --> 10:03.912
<i>All right</i>

10:05.720 --> 10:07.483
I love our new lives!

10:09.790 --> 10:10.814
Hey!

10:16.497 --> 10:19.057
What are you doing?

10:19.166 --> 10:20.224
It's Hawaii.

10:23.771 --> 10:26.467
Just because we're in Hawaii we're
gonna do things we don't normally do,

10:26.574 --> 10:28.769
like pick up hitchhikers?

10:28.876 --> 10:32.107
Come on. Nothing bad ever
happens in Hawaii, right?

10:39.618 --> 10:40.607
So, how far are you going?

10:40.720 --> 10:41.948
Lumahai Beach.

10:42.054 --> 10:45.455
Lumahai? Lumahai? I don't
think we know that area.

10:45.558 --> 10:48.425
It's about 10 miles ahead,
right on this road,

10:48.527 --> 10:49.789
right by where
the big trail is.

10:50.062 --> 10:51.120
You know that trail?

10:51.230 --> 10:52.993
Yeah, the big trail?

10:56.669 --> 11:00.662
But we're... But we're
not going that far. So...

11:04.043 --> 11:05.943
So, how far do you go?

11:06.078 --> 11:10.014
Uh... Just up
the road a bit.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.908
So, if you guys, you know,
stay here for five more minutes,

11:14.019 --> 11:15.111
I'm sure someone will
come along that can...

11:15.221 --> 11:18.088
We was waiting for, like,
an hour before you stopped.

11:18.190 --> 11:19.521
Maybe more.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.587
Shit, I thought
this was Hawaii.

11:22.695 --> 11:23.753
Sorry.

11:24.730 --> 11:26.095
Come on.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.758
Hey, you guys married?

11:29.869 --> 11:31.666
Yeah, yeah,
we just got married.

11:32.104 --> 11:35.403
Hold this. Some of these
pictures totally suck.

11:35.508 --> 11:37.237
It's one of those
cameras you chuck.

11:37.343 --> 11:39.368
- This one, this is a good one.
- Hey, Cleo, what are you doing?

11:39.478 --> 11:41.139
These people want to
see less of us, not more.

11:41.247 --> 11:42.578
Here it is.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.312
That's us doing
the deed in Oahu.

11:46.585 --> 11:47.574
Wow.

11:47.686 --> 11:50.382
We just woke up one morning
and decided to get married.

11:50.556 --> 11:51.682
Pretty, isn't it?

11:51.791 --> 11:53.725
Yeah, it's lovely.
It's...

11:54.827 --> 11:57.295
Wait. Is this in
a grocery store?

11:57.396 --> 12:00.126
Paula's Market. They do
it up real nice for you.

12:00.232 --> 12:02.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's an onion.

12:02.234 --> 12:04.964
Yeah, produce manager
took that picture.

12:05.571 --> 12:06.902
I know it sounds
kind of tacky,

12:07.006 --> 12:08.667
but it's pretty
frigging pretty

12:08.774 --> 12:11.868
when they add all the little
radishes in there and stuff.

12:11.977 --> 12:14.343
Right, that's
what those are.

12:14.547 --> 12:18.210
Hey, baby, look, it's Kale and
Cleo getting married in Oahu.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.510
Yeah.
Suitable for framing.

12:25.991 --> 12:28.323
You know what?
We'll just drive you there.

12:28.427 --> 12:32.329
Ten miles, I mean, listen...
We could have been there by now.

12:32.431 --> 12:34.194
Maybe next time, huh?

12:35.467 --> 12:37.560
Kale, don't be that way.

12:37.703 --> 12:38.761
Baby, come on.

12:38.871 --> 12:39.860
Come on, guys.

12:40.606 --> 12:41.800
We don't have to make
this a bigger deal...

12:41.907 --> 12:44.933
Cleo, get the fuck
out of this man's ride!

13:05.831 --> 13:09.130
Well, I think we
handled that really well.

13:16.075 --> 13:17.269
<i>Up there!</i>

13:17.376 --> 13:19.071
<i>Here we go.
Kalalau Trail.</i>

13:19.879 --> 13:21.813
- That's good.
- Bye, Mom!

13:22.748 --> 13:24.648
Well, I was just
pointing and shooting.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.513
These new things have
too many buttons for me.

13:26.619 --> 13:29.110
Yeah, that's what you get
for buying top of the line.

13:29.221 --> 13:32.850
I might have to break down and
actually read the manual some day.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.653
I would love to see that.
Thanks.

13:52.378 --> 13:53.470
Wow!

13:59.351 --> 14:00.943
Oh...

14:01.453 --> 14:02.511
Okay.

14:03.822 --> 14:06.450
Well, I guess
everybody else did it.

14:06.558 --> 14:08.116
Did they really?

14:09.728 --> 14:11.286
Show it no fear.

14:12.331 --> 14:15.164
I think the rest of it kind
of washed away or something.

14:15.267 --> 14:18.930
Okay, watch me. Keep your
eyes down, your speed up,

14:19.405 --> 14:23.774
avoid those green rocks
and just be fearless.

14:25.611 --> 14:27.738
Well, he made that
look easy.

14:28.213 --> 14:30.374
Yeah, but he's not
wearing a whole

14:30.482 --> 14:32.245
Dave's World of Camping
store on his back.

14:33.619 --> 14:35.246
All right, ready!

14:35.354 --> 14:36.378
World record, baby.

14:36.488 --> 14:37.648
Okay. Okay.

14:38.457 --> 14:40.220
Oh, my God!
Careful.

14:42.227 --> 14:43.251
You got it.

14:43.362 --> 14:44.488
Okay. Thank you.

14:45.497 --> 14:47.897
You did great.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.365
Come on, baby,
you can do it.

15:06.819 --> 15:08.184
Outstanding.

15:09.088 --> 15:10.749
Did I almost just
die right there?

15:10.856 --> 15:12.483
Come here, come here, come here.

15:12.591 --> 15:14.081
Are you okay?

15:14.193 --> 15:15.217
Yeah.

15:15.327 --> 15:16.919
I was doing so well,
I thought.

15:17.029 --> 15:18.587
God.

15:19.932 --> 15:21.365
Hey! What's your name?

15:25.536 --> 15:26.628
Have we met before?

15:26.737 --> 15:28.967
Because when I
first saw you guys,

15:29.073 --> 15:31.268
I was getting
a little déjà vu-y.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.672
- No. No.
- No.

15:32.777 --> 15:34.472
Nowhere I remember, Nick.

15:35.279 --> 15:36.576
That face.

15:38.416 --> 15:39.542
Are you an actor?

15:39.650 --> 15:40.674
No, no, no.

15:41.686 --> 15:43.483
I haven't seen you on TV?

15:43.587 --> 15:45.020
No such luck. No.

15:45.122 --> 15:48.523
Actually, Cliff is a screenplay
writer. He's very sought-after.

15:48.626 --> 15:51.618
All the big movie studios
want him to do their projects.

15:51.729 --> 15:55.324
I knew I smelled fame and fortune
on you. A screenplay writer?

15:55.433 --> 15:56.866
We just say screen...
Screenwriter.

15:56.967 --> 15:59.299
Any movies I might know?

15:59.403 --> 16:01.928
Well, actually my...
My...

16:02.707 --> 16:05.198
My first script is in
pre-production right now.

16:05.309 --> 16:08.540
So, if you ask me again
the same time next year...

16:08.713 --> 16:10.078
Who's in it?

16:11.315 --> 16:13.476
Still trying to figure that
out. Still casting out, so...

16:13.584 --> 16:15.814
Well, Nic Cage is
always money in my book.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.285
I like how he
gets all intense

16:17.388 --> 16:19.219
right at
the end of a sentence!

16:19.323 --> 16:21.052
So, you got
a good Act 2 twist?

16:21.158 --> 16:22.147
Yeah.

16:22.259 --> 16:23.726
Yeah?
It's...

16:25.162 --> 16:27.027
Are you in
the business, Nick?

16:27.131 --> 16:29.998
Me? No, no.
I just took some course,

16:30.101 --> 16:32.331
one of those
writing boot camps.

16:32.436 --> 16:34.631
I've had so many ass-puckering
experiences in life,

16:34.739 --> 16:37.902
I figured, "Hell, I'll
just throw it down on paper

16:38.008 --> 16:39.805
"and make myself
a million bucks. ' '

16:39.910 --> 16:41.673
Yeah. It's not
that easy, is it?

16:41.779 --> 16:44.873
I liked it all,
except the paperwork.

16:44.982 --> 16:47.177
You know, actually
making pages, it's just...

16:47.852 --> 16:49.717
Yeah.
But I got the basics down.

16:49.820 --> 16:53.779
Three acts, hero with a journey,
red snappers. All that shit.

16:54.725 --> 16:55.817
Red snappers?

16:55.926 --> 16:57.154
Yeah. You know,

16:57.261 --> 16:59.229
you bring in a character just
to fuck with the audience,

16:59.330 --> 17:00.854
just to try and
throw them off track...

17:00.965 --> 17:03.957
It's a herring.
It's a red herring.

17:05.169 --> 17:07.103
I'm pretty sure
it's a snapper.

17:07.204 --> 17:09.398
Excuse me while
I shake the bush here.

17:09.673 --> 17:12.574
So, you're, like,
halfway to famous, Cliff?

17:13.210 --> 17:15.144
Pretty much.
Outstanding!

17:15.378 --> 17:18.473
Yeah, there's a whole big crew
getting ready in Vancouver,

17:18.616 --> 17:20.413
building sets and stuff.

17:20.518 --> 17:23.214
But they're there,
you're here.

17:25.021 --> 17:28.458
Yeah. Yeah.
It's hard to explain,

17:28.559 --> 17:32.393
but they brought in another
guy to do a quick rewrite. So...

17:32.496 --> 17:33.929
On your story?

17:34.031 --> 17:37.296
Yeah, just a two-week
punch-up. They... It's common.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.369
Yeah, how long ago
was this?

17:41.872 --> 17:42.861
It's nine weeks now.

17:42.973 --> 17:43.940
Yeah.

17:44.441 --> 17:48.775
No. That's fucked up. That's your
vision, Cliff. That's your baby.

17:48.879 --> 17:50.676
You can't let them
get away with that shit.

17:50.781 --> 17:53.079
He's got these agents
and they don't do...

17:53.184 --> 17:55.243
I mean, they don't
fight for him or anything.

17:55.352 --> 17:56.683
And I was just telling
Cliff the other day...

17:56.787 --> 17:59.017
Not that "me" isn't
my favorite subject,

17:59.123 --> 18:01.648
but maybe we could talk about
something else for a while.

18:01.759 --> 18:04.751
Well, I'm going to leave you
with one last pearl of wisdom.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.031
Get a new agent?
You get a new story.

18:13.036 --> 18:14.765
What?
Me, too!

18:14.871 --> 18:16.839
I have one! No!
Wait a minute.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.066
What should we do?
Should we go up

18:18.174 --> 18:19.266
or should we
just go back down?

18:19.375 --> 18:21.036
This is supposed to be
the best service, ever.

18:21.144 --> 18:22.168
I don't care.

18:22.278 --> 18:24.678
Did you hear about Oahu,
what happened there?

18:24.781 --> 18:25.770
Why? What happened?

18:25.882 --> 18:27.907
Well, my dad just
called from KCK.

18:28.017 --> 18:30.417
Reception's, like,
major shit out here.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.284
But he said something
about some murders.

18:35.491 --> 18:36.458
Wow.

18:36.826 --> 18:38.657
There's no service.

18:38.962 --> 18:40.293
Flat line.

18:40.396 --> 18:42.023
I'm in and out,
mostly out.

18:42.498 --> 18:44.056
Wait.
This is in Honolulu?

18:44.167 --> 18:45.930
Dad wants us to leave.

18:46.035 --> 18:48.230
I think he's in major
overreaction mode, okay?

18:48.338 --> 18:50.033
Some newlyweds were
killed somewhere, he said.

18:50.139 --> 18:51.163
That's what happened.

18:51.274 --> 18:52.366
Yeah.

18:52.475 --> 18:53.840
That's awful.

18:54.243 --> 18:57.337
I mean, we were just there,
like, the day before yesterday.

18:57.447 --> 18:59.438
We have been planning this for,
like, five-and-a-half months!

18:59.549 --> 19:01.881
Does he not even know
it's a different island?

19:01.985 --> 19:03.577
What did your dad say?

19:03.686 --> 19:06.712
I mean, do they know who did
it? Do they know anything?

19:06.823 --> 19:08.757
He says that they're
looking for two people.

19:08.858 --> 19:11.292
A man and a woman.
That's all I got.

19:11.394 --> 19:14.955
<i>It's like that movie, huh?
Natural Born Killers.</i>

19:16.165 --> 19:18.224
Oh, my God, that movie,
like, totally freaked me out.

19:18.334 --> 19:19.528
When his head was doing
that thing... Majorly.

19:22.505 --> 19:24.666
Well, what do you think?

19:24.774 --> 19:26.765
I mean,
it was Oahu, not here.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.174
Well, speak now or
forever hold your peace.

19:33.149 --> 19:35.913
Well, hey, I mean,
it's our honeymoon, right?

19:36.018 --> 19:37.178
Why don't you guys
come with us?

19:37.286 --> 19:39.754
We're going all the way to Kalalau
Beach, all the way to the end.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.882
Wait, you guys are,
like, newlyweds?

19:45.294 --> 19:46.454
Yeah.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.432
Have a swell honeymoon.

19:52.535 --> 19:53.627
Wait!

19:53.870 --> 19:56.498
Stop! Don't make me run.

19:57.974 --> 19:59.441
You guys are such cowards.

20:06.649 --> 20:12.451
Well, I exit here. Be safe.
Some hard yards ahead.

20:13.456 --> 20:17.222
Are you... Are you
camping over at Secret Falls?

20:19.595 --> 20:20.789
I read all about it
in the guidebook.

20:23.998 --> 20:25.192
Yeah, just for the day.

20:25.299 --> 20:28.097
I had to run back to the
truck for a little butane.

20:28.202 --> 20:30.500
Well, how close is it?

20:30.605 --> 20:32.436
Well, it's like
everything else in Hawaii.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.235
It's as close
as far away gets.

20:34.342 --> 20:35.366
Baby.
What?

20:35.476 --> 20:36.738
It sounds so romantic.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.812
Yeah, but I'd like to get
to the beach by sunset.

20:38.913 --> 20:41.609
But it's only like, what, like, a
mile or something? It's, like, nothing.

20:41.716 --> 20:45.049
Honey, come on. Maybe we
should give the man his privacy.

20:45.553 --> 20:48.613
Don't matter to me.
Plenty of Eden to go around.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.163
What?

21:00.268 --> 21:01.257
Nothing.

21:03.004 --> 21:04.938
One mile?

21:05.039 --> 21:06.438
One. Serious?

21:06.541 --> 21:08.099
Yeah.
Cool!

21:08.743 --> 21:10.176
Hey, wait up!

21:39.874 --> 21:41.000
Wow!

21:41.809 --> 21:47.270
Well, I do believe
she's clotheless.

21:47.381 --> 21:49.508
Hey, there.

21:49.617 --> 21:50.982
I do believe he is, too.

22:00.995 --> 22:02.428
This is Gina!

22:03.765 --> 22:05.824
Did he mention
Gina before?

22:06.467 --> 22:08.992
Crazy-ass love of
my crazy-ass life!

22:10.304 --> 22:11.703
He has now.

22:11.806 --> 22:16.038
Okay. So, they're,
like, a couple?

22:20.014 --> 22:21.948
Y'all coming in or what?

22:22.650 --> 22:25.084
Baby, are we
going in or not?

22:25.787 --> 22:29.382
Yeah, in a minute. Let me see
if I can get some reception.

22:30.758 --> 22:31.816
Okay.

22:46.874 --> 22:48.466
That's nice.

22:51.746 --> 22:56.410
I hope we're not intruding
on your private paradise here.

22:56.551 --> 23:00.647
Forget it, Nicko's always
bringing home strays.

23:02.323 --> 23:05.315
Mrs. Cydney Anderson.
We're newlyweds.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.190
Miss Gina Struggs.
We're not.

23:18.973 --> 23:20.372
You are so dead.

23:35.890 --> 23:36.948
Okay.

23:40.728 --> 23:43.128
Here we go. Come on.

23:50.238 --> 23:55.369
"Thursday on Oahu. Possibly
mainlanders on their honeymoon.

23:57.845 --> 24:00.143
"Teeth and
fingerprints removed.

24:00.781 --> 24:05.980
"Have reason to believe killers
may have jumped islands to Kauai. ' '

24:11.592 --> 24:12.718
Are you shitting me?

24:12.827 --> 24:15.295
No, these girls on
the trail told us.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.863
I feel like
maybe we saw someone.

24:19.033 --> 24:21.433
They know who it was
who did the killing?

24:21.535 --> 24:23.127
I don't think so.

24:32.980 --> 24:36.677
"Security cameras
released photo of suspect. ' '

24:47.128 --> 24:51.292
You know what I heard? A few
people die out here every year.

24:51.799 --> 24:55.667
They just stand under a waterfall,
get hit by some falling rock.

24:55.770 --> 25:00.002
Or maybe they just slip and
go right on over. Vanish.

25:02.376 --> 25:06.904
Who knows how? Or even why.
Could be the wages of sin.

25:10.785 --> 25:13.845
How you doing, Hot Wheels?

25:13.955 --> 25:15.183
I'm good.

25:18.526 --> 25:22.462
That's two lies in one day. It
comes naturally to you, don't it?

25:25.533 --> 25:27.592
Are you following us, Kale?

25:30.438 --> 25:33.339
You know, it ain't the fact
that you deceived us.

25:33.441 --> 25:35.966
Every man's got a pack
of lies in him, right?

25:36.444 --> 25:40.107
It's just that you thought we
was foolish enough to buy it.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.480
I'm sorry, I don't...

25:43.584 --> 25:45.108
What did you think,
anyway?

25:45.219 --> 25:46.686
Just 'cause we choose
to look a certain way

25:46.787 --> 25:49.813
that makes us,
what, desperados?

25:50.558 --> 25:52.219
No, I don't think...
Jesus, man.

25:52.326 --> 25:55.784
You know, sometimes it feels
like the whole world's just

25:55.896 --> 25:57.386
spitting in my face.

26:01.435 --> 26:02.732
Excuse me.

26:04.405 --> 26:08.865
Look. I thought you said you
were going to Lumahai Beach.

26:08.976 --> 26:12.104
"Going to that area. ' '
That's what we said.

26:12.213 --> 26:15.273
Well, you didn't say you
were doing the trail, so...

26:15.416 --> 26:17.247
Well, neither did you.

26:17.918 --> 26:22.480
Look. We offered you a ride. You
didn't want it. You didn't take it.

26:23.124 --> 26:26.719
So, I don't really understand
what the issue is between us.

26:27.561 --> 26:28.619
Kale?

26:34.201 --> 26:36.066
Joy and happiness here?

26:37.038 --> 26:38.903
No, I think we're good.

26:40.674 --> 26:42.039
Outstanding.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.002
How far you going,
Hot Wheels?

26:46.113 --> 26:49.549
Playing it by ear. You?

26:49.650 --> 26:50.912
Probably the next beach.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.286
What's it called?

26:53.387 --> 26:54.911
Hanakapi'ai.

26:55.022 --> 26:57.115
That one, yeah. Maybe
there, maybe further.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.419
Need permits to go further.

27:03.431 --> 27:05.797
Should have
given us a ride, man.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.328
Come on.

27:18.446 --> 27:23.440
So, after a $45 taxi ride, we
wind up at the Ocean View Hotel.

27:23.551 --> 27:25.212
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

27:25.319 --> 27:29.756
Problem is it hadn't actually
had an ocean view since 1987,

27:29.857 --> 27:32.485
when these high-rises
went up across the street.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.288
Jesus. Everyone's like,
"Waikiki is so great!"

27:36.397 --> 27:39.093
Honestly, it's getting
on my last nerve.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.364
Are we okay?

27:46.474 --> 27:47.941
Yeah. Let's keep an
eye on our time, okay?

27:48.042 --> 27:50.203
Yeah, but do those packs belong
to who I think they belong to?

27:50.311 --> 27:52.211
Yeah, they said they were
doing the trail all along.

27:52.313 --> 27:53.837
I don't know,
maybe they were.

27:53.948 --> 27:56.416
Shit, it's 1:30 already.
Come on, let's go.

27:59.787 --> 28:01.914
Hey, baby,
you want to break this down?

28:02.022 --> 28:03.785
We should be
clackalacking, too.

28:03.891 --> 28:04.949
Okey-dokey.

28:05.059 --> 28:06.083
Thank you.

28:08.362 --> 28:10.557
So, you guys don't
mind if we tag along?

28:10.664 --> 28:13.394
I mean, we're all
going to the same place.

28:13.868 --> 28:15.301
It's fine with me.

28:17.004 --> 28:18.835
Yeah. Are you kidding?

28:21.175 --> 28:22.574
Did you take the permits?

28:22.676 --> 28:23.802
No, I didn't touch them.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.073
Well, I put them right
here in this brochure.

28:28.015 --> 28:30.313
Did you leave
them at the store?

28:30.684 --> 28:34.984
No. I'm pretty sure I put...
No, I'm positive I put... Shit!

29:00.948 --> 29:02.745
While we're
still young, Cliff?

29:04.218 --> 29:05.685
Yeah, one sec!

29:13.627 --> 29:15.151
We leave no man behind.

29:15.329 --> 29:16.887
These are some hard yards.

29:34.381 --> 29:38.147
Guess you can't have rainbows
without a little rain. Right?

29:48.929 --> 29:52.194
You hear that Cliff here
is a big screenplay writer?

29:52.566 --> 29:54.761
You write for the movies?

29:55.302 --> 29:57.065
Whoopty-tah.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.160
Yeah, we say
screenwriter.

29:58.272 --> 30:00.365
He's on the prowl for
a new story. Sorry.

30:00.474 --> 30:01.771
You know, I could tell
you shit you ain't seen

30:01.875 --> 30:03.399
in no Hollywood movie before.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.102
You watch yourself now.

30:05.212 --> 30:06.201
What?

30:06.380 --> 30:08.348
What, what?
You know what.

30:08.449 --> 30:12.146
Maybe Cliff here can change
the names to protect the guilty.

30:12.319 --> 30:13.308
You guys do that
in movies, right?

30:13.420 --> 30:14.444
Yeah.

30:14.555 --> 30:16.580
You know Johnny Depp?
He knows Nic Cage.

30:16.724 --> 30:18.089
You see him playing me in some movie?

30:18.192 --> 30:19.659
Baby, you know Nic Cage?

30:19.760 --> 30:21.625
Yeah. Yeah, I do now.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.589
No. See, me, myself, I like
that Johnny Depp better.

30:24.698 --> 30:29.067
I mean, he is just dreamy. I
mean, the way he looks at you.

30:29.169 --> 30:32.627
Jesus Christ. Honey!
It all starts with story.

30:32.740 --> 30:33.729
Am I right, Cliff?

30:33.841 --> 30:34.865
Yeah.

30:35.409 --> 30:38.276
You know, I once made a surprise
visit in a certain dictator's palace

30:38.379 --> 30:39.607
on the Tigris River?

30:39.713 --> 30:42.614
Newly evacuated. Still
smell the Havana tobacco

30:42.716 --> 30:44.013
hanging in the air.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.416
We were tasked with finding
perishable intel, computer dish,

30:46.520 --> 30:47.578
shit like that.

30:47.688 --> 30:49.451
But in the master bathroom,

30:49.556 --> 30:52.116
about the size of fucking
Ethiopia, by the way,

30:52.226 --> 30:54.285
there's golden
dolphins for faucets.

30:54.395 --> 30:57.023
There was this lock box
bolted to the floor,

30:57.131 --> 30:59.190
had his initials
engraved on top.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.824
We started beating on
that fucking lock...

31:00.934 --> 31:02.902
Wait, Iraq?
You were in Iraq?

31:03.003 --> 31:04.061
Yeah, first in.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.296
Me and my wolf pack.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.808
Fuck those pictures you saw of
the 4th Infantry. That was later.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.037
What I'm giving you now
is God's real shit.

31:12.146 --> 31:14.614
He is not supposed to be
talking about this stuff.

31:14.715 --> 31:19.550
So, inside this box,
I figured maybe cash,

31:20.254 --> 31:22.620
<i>maybe a set of
pearl-handled pistolas.</i>

31:22.723 --> 31:26.819
Hell, maybe some damn fine
presidential-grade hashish.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.691
We finally burned it open
with a 50-grain det cord.

31:29.797 --> 31:31.697
It's a handy tool, det cord. Yeah.

31:31.799 --> 31:34.461
Wrap it around a tree,
three-feet thick.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.193
Drop it across a trail when
someone's hot on your ass.

31:36.303 --> 31:37.327
Remember that trick.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.271
Yeah. A det cord.
That's a nice detail.

31:40.374 --> 31:41.932
Well, you gotta get
the details right, Cliff.

31:42.042 --> 31:45.375
Otherwise, we're just making
another big craptastic movie.

31:45.479 --> 31:47.845
So, we opened this thing.
What do we find?

31:47.948 --> 31:49.245
What do we find?
What do we find?

31:49.350 --> 31:52.717
<i>Iron Man. Avengers. Dude was
a Silver Age Marvel freak.</i>

31:52.853 --> 31:55.651
And you know what he had most
of in his own personal stash?

31:55.756 --> 31:57.155
I don't know, Nick.
I wasn't there.

31:57.257 --> 31:58.383
<i>Sub-Mariner.</i>

31:58.492 --> 31:59.857
All in French What?
For some reason.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.325
Namor, prince of the deep?
Yeah.

32:01.428 --> 32:03.862
<i>Why Sub-Mariner? Isn't that,
like, one of the shit titles?</i>

32:03.964 --> 32:07.525
One theory,
tug-job material.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.125
<i>Mr. Presidente had a thing
for French-speaking fellows,</i>

32:10.270 --> 32:13.068
little Speedos and
big spears. One theory.

32:17.745 --> 32:22.341
So, you were,
like, Special Ops.

32:23.484 --> 32:25.679
What were you?
Seals? Rangers?

32:28.122 --> 32:29.589
Officially,
I'm only allowed to say

32:29.690 --> 32:31.055
that I've been
a sworn officer

32:31.158 --> 32:33.991
participating in a tactical
phase of certain missions

32:34.094 --> 32:36.221
that would make most
men want to crawl up

32:36.330 --> 32:38.992
and hide inside
their own assholes.

32:39.099 --> 32:40.691
And unofficially?

32:42.336 --> 32:44.429
I'm a goddamn American Jedi.

32:46.473 --> 32:49.067
Possible title
number one, by the way.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.910
Hey. See this?

32:58.919 --> 33:02.753
Took a frag from a Bouncing
Betty. It's an antipersonnel mine.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.751
Caved in the back
of my fucking head.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.558
Medevaced out to Germany.

33:11.665 --> 33:15.226
Got my skull rebuilt
with space-age titanium.

33:15.335 --> 33:17.462
Can't go through a metal
detector without ringing cherries,

33:17.571 --> 33:18.799
but that's cool.

33:18.906 --> 33:22.364
Lets me travel with Gilligan
just about wherever I want.

33:22.476 --> 33:23.704
Gilligan?

33:29.583 --> 33:31.141
My little buddy.

33:35.456 --> 33:37.151
That's some toothpick.

33:37.257 --> 33:42.388
Here's the kicker, though. When I
took that shrapnel, I never felt it.

33:43.363 --> 33:46.457
I mean, I felt the impact and
I felt my backside go all wet,

33:46.567 --> 33:48.125
but no real pain.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.635
Now, maybe I don't
recall events in full.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.730
They did scoop out a little gray
Spam back there, but get this.

33:55.476 --> 33:58.673
My wolf pack? They will
swear that I was ambulatory

33:58.779 --> 34:00.144
for more than 17 minutes

34:00.247 --> 34:02.807
before they forced me
to lie down. Tackled me.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.585
Even then I was looking to
monkey-fuck a Marlboro Light.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.224
There's no nerve endings
in the brain, Cliff.

34:12.391 --> 34:15.054
Remember that when
you write the scene.

34:16.396 --> 34:19.388
Yeah. There's some
really good details there.

34:20.801 --> 34:23.065
Yeah, he's really
hard to kill.

34:39.152 --> 34:41.245
Hey. Y'all make it
to the beach?

34:41.355 --> 34:43.380
Yeah, it's great.
Just keep going.

34:48.262 --> 34:50.730
Hey. You see any rangers up ahead?

34:50.831 --> 34:51.820
None that I saw.

34:51.931 --> 34:54.366
It's only, like, three
miles to the beach, we hope?

34:54.467 --> 34:57.232
Yeah, but lots of
twists and turns ahead.

34:59.907 --> 35:04.037
Hey, the further we go, the
fewer people on the trail.

35:05.178 --> 35:06.805
And your point is?

35:12.252 --> 35:14.720
Back there.
Pretend you gotta pee.

35:15.889 --> 35:17.083
Pretend?

35:22.362 --> 35:25.490
The cops in Honolulu released
a photo of the killers.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.294
Apparently, they didn't know
they were on camera.

35:31.538 --> 35:32.732
Come on.

35:34.808 --> 35:36.173
Shit.
What?

35:43.250 --> 35:45.081
It could be anybody.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.277
Are you sure about that?

35:47.721 --> 35:50.019
They don't look
familiar to you?

35:51.558 --> 35:53.549
Y'all good or what?

35:53.660 --> 35:55.218
Having a bathroom break!

35:57.464 --> 36:00.797
You are freaking me out!
It could be anybody.

36:03.403 --> 36:05.371
I mean, what do we really
know about these people

36:05.472 --> 36:07.099
aside from him
and his stories?

36:07.207 --> 36:08.674
Which, I might add,
are starting to sound

36:08.775 --> 36:10.436
more and more
bullshitty to me.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.602
Next thing we're
going to find out

36:11.712 --> 36:14.146
he's got the heart of
a baboon or something.

36:14.247 --> 36:15.737
I think he's just
trying to impress.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.975
I mean, you know, he thinks
you're going to write a movie

36:18.085 --> 36:20.053
about his life
or something.

36:20.654 --> 36:22.212
What do we know?

36:24.157 --> 36:27.354
Well, she's from Savannah. Her
father is a controlling military shit.

36:27.461 --> 36:29.429
She rebelled. She met
Nick in South Carolina,

36:29.529 --> 36:30.962
but he reminded her
too much of Daddy.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.964
He chased her until finally
giving up and moving on,

36:33.066 --> 36:35.034
but that's when she got
interested in him, of course.

36:35.135 --> 36:36.227
It's their first
time in Hawaii.

36:36.336 --> 36:38.031
They thought Waikiki
was a little Las Vegas,

36:38.138 --> 36:40.629
but they love
it here on Kauai.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.072
Girls talk.

36:45.779 --> 36:47.770
So, they were
on Oahu, too.

36:51.151 --> 36:52.778
I guess they were.

37:06.533 --> 37:09.024
Interesting guy, Cliff.

37:09.136 --> 37:10.125
Yeah.

37:10.504 --> 37:14.201
First man ever who wants to
talk while he's in the bathroom.

37:15.008 --> 37:17.101
What is going on
back there?

37:19.279 --> 37:21.804
You keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

37:21.915 --> 37:22.882
Keep shaking
that bush, Luke!

37:41.266 --> 37:44.360
I mean, we're supposed to be
on our honeymoon. Okay?

37:44.569 --> 37:48.164
So, slow down that
overactive brain of yours

37:48.273 --> 37:50.434
'cause I want to
enjoy myself here.

37:51.276 --> 37:53.642
Babe, we're gonna be fine.

38:07.359 --> 38:09.827
Well, I guess the beach
will still be there tomorrow.

38:09.928 --> 38:11.759
Yeah, I hope we are.

38:18.303 --> 38:25.175
All right. We got macaroni and
cheese with real imitation cheese.

38:26.077 --> 38:29.171
Honey, that's a vegetable
dish where I come from.

38:29.281 --> 38:30.646
What else you got?

38:30.815 --> 38:33.045
Vegetarian corned beef hash.

38:33.985 --> 38:35.919
What is vegetarian
corned beef hash?

38:36.021 --> 38:37.454
That is suspicious,

38:37.922 --> 38:40.550
but I might dig into that

38:41.459 --> 38:44.223
before eating
chicken omelet surprise.

38:44.562 --> 38:45.756
What's so bad about that?

38:45.864 --> 38:49.800
Well, the surprise is that they're
gonna take the egg out of the chicken,

38:50.068 --> 38:53.401
whip it up, and then put the
chicken back into the egg.

39:14.324 --> 39:15.018
That's good reflexes,
for a writer.

39:23.032 --> 39:26.058
What?
I love that stuff.

39:48.191 --> 39:49.624
What?

39:49.726 --> 39:50.852
What, what?

39:51.127 --> 39:52.424
What do you mean,
"What, what"?

39:52.528 --> 39:54.826
What's everybody
looking at?

39:55.565 --> 39:57.533
Whatever he's looking at.

40:03.473 --> 40:07.239
Probably just a goat. There's
a lot of them in these valleys.

40:13.349 --> 40:15.317
I haven't seen any goats.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.382
I don't expect
you would, Cliff.

40:18.755 --> 40:23.249
Your situational awareness kind
of sucks. That's not a knock.

40:23.359 --> 40:26.328
You're a screenwriter.
I'm a Jedi.

40:26.429 --> 40:28.226
That's just
different paths we chose.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.429
Think they kill them first?

40:34.003 --> 40:36.028
Or he just drown in there?

40:37.607 --> 40:39.837
I always wondered.

40:39.942 --> 40:41.273
No, I'm good.

40:42.378 --> 40:45.074
Just so I know whether
or not to be offended,

40:45.181 --> 40:47.615
define
"situational awareness. ' '

40:47.717 --> 40:50.845
What's the first thing you do
when you step onto a plane?

40:50.953 --> 40:54.081
Maybe you have a sip
of that fine champagne?

40:55.158 --> 40:57.217
You do fly in
first class, right?

40:58.361 --> 41:01.023
I put away my shit,
like everyone else.

41:04.867 --> 41:09.566
Well, when I board a plane, making
my way back to the cheap seats,

41:10.006 --> 41:11.701
I clock every door.

41:12.041 --> 41:15.067
I pace off the distance
between those exits and my seat.

41:15.178 --> 41:17.237
That plane loses
power on takeoff,

41:17.346 --> 41:19.940
I can make egress in
the dark, totally blind.

41:20.049 --> 41:23.143
If the aisle crowds up, I'm going
to climb over the back of 36D,

41:23.252 --> 41:26.688
guy with that shiny-ass toupee,
make the over-the-wing exit.

41:26.789 --> 41:28.552
And I know the handle
swings down, not up.

41:28.658 --> 41:30.785
And I know the door
swings in, not out.

41:30.893 --> 41:33.157
And I know all that
inside of 30 seconds,

41:33.262 --> 41:37.460
before they even pop the cork for
you up there in Hollywood class.

41:39.702 --> 41:44.162
See, if you wait till the emergency
happens before you decide what to do,

41:45.107 --> 41:46.836
you're already dead.

41:50.379 --> 41:52.609
What chance do you have
of that happening?

41:52.715 --> 41:53.841
Happened in Sioux City.

41:53.950 --> 41:55.008
Sioux City?

41:55.117 --> 41:58.109
DC-10. It rolled
four times on landing.

41:59.155 --> 42:02.818
Wound up in an Iowa
cornfield, 112 people dead.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.523
Yeah, I remember seeing that on TV.

42:05.628 --> 42:08.290
Yeah.
I saw it from the inside.

42:09.665 --> 42:12.259
He is really hard to kill.

42:18.307 --> 42:19.535
Let's go.

42:21.477 --> 42:24.071
Hey! What are you going
to do with that thing?

42:24.180 --> 42:26.580
Dinner. Come on.

42:26.682 --> 42:30.243
Dry underwear,
but thanks, though.

42:31.554 --> 42:34.352
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

42:34.457 --> 42:36.948
Come on, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty.

42:39.595 --> 42:41.085
Excuse me?

42:41.197 --> 42:42.323
It's no problem.

42:42.631 --> 42:44.496
You want to stay in the
kitchen with the lady folks,

42:44.600 --> 42:46.431
you stay.

42:46.736 --> 42:48.931
Yeah, I'm an adult,

42:49.038 --> 42:52.872
so that kitty noise, that's
not... Doesn't work anymore.

43:14.697 --> 43:17.427
You know,
it crossed my mind

43:19.368 --> 43:22.895
that it crossed your mind
that we're the ones.

43:24.273 --> 43:25.638
Me and Gina.

43:27.743 --> 43:29.040
The ones who...

43:29.145 --> 43:30.373
It's okay, Cliff.

43:30.479 --> 43:32.913
That's your screenplay-writer
mind working its magic,

43:33.015 --> 43:36.542
spinning shit every which
way. You gotta think like that.

43:36.986 --> 43:39.750
What? The killers?

43:40.289 --> 43:42.052
"The Gruesome Twosome. ' '

43:43.859 --> 43:45.850
Possible title number two.

43:46.529 --> 43:48.895
See, now I think your
mind's spinning, Nick.

43:48.998 --> 43:50.329
So, you think it's
just a coincidence

43:50.433 --> 43:52.128
we were there at
the same time on Oahu?

43:52.234 --> 43:53.724
Just like Cydney
and I were there.

43:53.836 --> 43:55.827
Just a lot of people on Oahu
when the murders happened.

43:55.938 --> 43:56.905
That's the way
you look at it?

43:57.006 --> 43:59.133
That's exactly how
I look at it, Nick.

43:59.241 --> 44:00.299
Good.

44:02.344 --> 44:05.245
Though it would make
a hell of an Act 2 twist.

44:10.586 --> 44:13.919
We're not really hunting
goats here, are we?

44:14.023 --> 44:15.081
No.

44:16.959 --> 44:20.417
Then mind telling me what the
hell we are doing out here?

44:20.529 --> 44:22.588
We got us a shadow.
Two of them.

44:22.698 --> 44:25.531
Haven't identified them as hostile
yet, but they passed by our camp,

44:25.634 --> 44:27.033
double backed
for a second look

44:27.136 --> 44:30.196
and then they took cover
somewhere in here.

44:31.273 --> 44:33.366
I know,
you didn't see them.

44:34.276 --> 44:35.436
People from the Falls?

44:35.544 --> 44:36.636
It's someone else.

44:36.745 --> 44:38.440
All right, should get
back to camp. Come on.

44:38.547 --> 44:40.742
Gina could take
care of herself.

44:41.283 --> 44:43.410
I was thinking
about Cydney.

44:43.986 --> 44:46.250
Gina could take
care of her, too.

44:46.922 --> 44:49.390
Are you just so fucking with me, Nick?

44:49.492 --> 44:52.461
If I was the killer,
I wouldn't stay in Oahu.

44:53.629 --> 44:55.893
I'd come right here.

44:55.998 --> 44:57.022
Wait.

44:59.168 --> 45:02.228
I'm a little
worried about Cliff.

45:03.672 --> 45:07.108
He's not really, you know,
the bow and arrow type.

45:07.276 --> 45:08.436
Please.

45:08.644 --> 45:09.906
Boys are happiest
when they're hunting

45:10.012 --> 45:13.004
something they
can't quite catch.

45:13.616 --> 45:17.211
Besides, gives us
a little time together.

45:23.125 --> 45:25.389
No, dope's not
really my thing.

45:28.831 --> 45:32.096
So, what is
your thing, Cydney?

45:32.201 --> 45:34.965
'Cause we really
hadn't heard yet.

45:36.705 --> 45:39.230
It would sound
kind of boring to you.

45:39.542 --> 45:40.941
Well, try me.

45:44.711 --> 45:48.704
Well, we've been working
really hard at getting pregnant.

45:49.283 --> 45:52.309
We're gonna have five kids,
two boys and three girls,

45:52.419 --> 45:57.755
and they'll be beautiful
beyond belief, of course.

45:58.492 --> 46:01.791
We wanna get a place in the
Palisades, close to one of the bluffs.

46:01.895 --> 46:04.329
Take long walks
in the summertime,

46:04.431 --> 46:06.797
and watch all
the boats come in.

46:07.768 --> 46:12.728
You know, and it'll just
be us, you know, our family.

46:13.740 --> 46:18.177
And I guess, you know, I'll
just be happy being called Mom

46:19.112 --> 46:20.977
and Mrs. Cydney Anderson

46:23.650 --> 46:25.015
for a while.

46:27.688 --> 46:32.557
You know, there was this
preacher back in Georgia

46:33.193 --> 46:37.027
and he used to tell all us
kids how we would rot in hell

46:37.130 --> 46:39.792
for having sex outside
the sanctity of marriage.

46:39.900 --> 46:43.859
And then one day, you know,
bless his little heart,

46:43.971 --> 46:47.839
his wife caught him out back the
Waffle House with some hooker.

46:49.576 --> 46:51.771
A hooker with
a really big dick.

46:54.615 --> 47:00.212
Yeah. So, now
when people wanna tell me

47:00.320 --> 47:03.551
how so fucking
perfect their lives are,

47:06.260 --> 47:08.023
I don't believe them.

47:12.366 --> 47:13.526
Um...

47:46.266 --> 47:47.392
Hey!

47:50.137 --> 47:51.229
Nick!

47:56.143 --> 47:58.509
I do lie about my
old life sometimes.

47:59.313 --> 48:02.214
See, when my parents stopped
slapping the crap out of each other

48:02.316 --> 48:03.943
and split up,

48:04.685 --> 48:07.916
they decided that they
could have two kids each.

48:08.021 --> 48:11.218
The problem was
there was five kids,

48:11.325 --> 48:15.421
so I did the foster
scare thing for a while

48:15.529 --> 48:19.431
and that only lasted until
I met this guy named Rocky.

48:19.533 --> 48:21.797
He was a couple
of years older.

48:23.570 --> 48:27.233
And it's so funny.
Everyone in the neighborhood

48:27.341 --> 48:31.277
thought he was like this fine,
young gentleman, you know.

48:31.378 --> 48:35.439
But I saw something different
in him, something risky,

48:35.983 --> 48:36.972
something crooked and cool.

48:39.952 --> 48:42.978
Didn't hurt that he had
his own truck, neither.

48:43.456 --> 48:44.923
He did.
Yeah.

48:45.725 --> 48:50.219
Wrong paint on one door, but damn,
he had some nice chrome wheels on it.

48:50.330 --> 48:51.729
Yeah. I know Rocky.

48:52.699 --> 48:56.999
Yeah, this one night, he
drove me out onto the lake.

48:58.805 --> 49:01.171
And it was
hot and raining.

49:01.674 --> 49:04.973
And I had the top
button of my shorts

49:05.078 --> 49:07.672
all undone for this guy, you know,

49:07.780 --> 49:11.375
and just hoping this is
why we came down here.

49:12.251 --> 49:13.513
Oh, God.

49:13.619 --> 49:18.318
You know, I remember the way
the cracks in the vinyl seat

49:18.424 --> 49:20.949
were pinching
the back of my legs.

49:21.060 --> 49:22.322
You know,
and that was bothering me,

49:22.428 --> 49:25.659
but what he was doing with
his fingers sure wasn't.

49:25.765 --> 49:29.599
And suddenly, he's in my
hand, all slippery and nice,

49:29.702 --> 49:31.533
and he's about to go off.

49:31.637 --> 49:34.970
And I'm about to come for,
like, the first time, ever.

49:37.276 --> 49:39.176
And then he puts
the headlights on.

49:42.014 --> 49:44.881
And he makes me get
out of the car to go...

49:46.251 --> 49:49.220
Go look at something
over by a pile of leaves.

49:51.790 --> 49:55.226
And it was Goldie,
the neighbor's Labrador.

49:57.295 --> 49:58.990
And he still had...

50:00.098 --> 50:02.623
He still had the panty hose
wrapped around his neck

50:02.734 --> 50:05.294
from when he had
hung it from a tree.

50:10.642 --> 50:14.339
He said he would kill me
if I ever told anybody.

50:19.518 --> 50:22.316
Well, did you
ever tell anybody?

50:27.592 --> 50:28.650
Yeah.

50:31.496 --> 50:32.793
Right now.

50:43.575 --> 50:44.701
Jesus!

50:50.148 --> 50:53.174
You know, it always amazes me how
much people talk about themselves

50:53.318 --> 50:54.876
when they're on vacation.

50:55.020 --> 50:57.045
Talk to people
they only just met.

50:58.190 --> 50:59.623
Yeah.

51:02.494 --> 51:03.552
Yeah.

51:34.693 --> 51:35.682
Hey, what you doing?

51:38.463 --> 51:40.829
Cliff, yeah?
Cliff Anderson.

51:42.834 --> 51:43.926
What are you doing?

51:44.035 --> 51:45.627
I thought that was you, but then
I seen four peeps instead of two,

51:45.737 --> 51:47.364
you know,
I got all mixed up and...

51:47.472 --> 51:50.100
But what are you doing here? Why are
you following us and who is that female?

51:50.208 --> 51:51.402
That's my bitch, Jessie.

51:51.509 --> 51:52.874
But what are you
doing here?

51:52.977 --> 51:54.308
Your permits, brother.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.812
You had leave them
at the store, okay?

51:58.383 --> 51:59.372
You came all
this way just to...

51:59.484 --> 52:01.349
Auntie thought
you needed them.

52:01.452 --> 52:02.942
This ain't
the mainland, brother.

52:03.054 --> 52:05.215
We do this shit
here, okay?

52:05.323 --> 52:06.381
Okay?

52:06.824 --> 52:09.918
All right. All right,
I'm sorry. Okay? Easy.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.819
No, no, no. Hey,
I'm sorry. I'm...

52:14.165 --> 52:15.894
I guess we're all
just stressed

52:16.567 --> 52:20.025
with those killers being over
here now. I'm really sorry.

52:20.204 --> 52:21.603
Here.
No, no, no.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.364
On this island?

52:23.941 --> 52:25.568
Yeah.
My papers, brother.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.743
I... I saw a news
report on it. You didn't?

52:31.249 --> 52:34.013
No. I don't
watch the news.

52:34.452 --> 52:36.886
It's way too
informational.

52:38.656 --> 52:43.150
Hey, just... Why don't you come back
to camp and have some dinner with us?

52:44.028 --> 52:47.486
Okay? You and
your bitch friend.

52:47.965 --> 52:51.332
Thanks, but you know what, I'm not feeling
the running stream of love over here,

52:51.436 --> 52:54.200
you know what I mean?
Here's your permits.

52:54.472 --> 52:57.600
I'm gonna head on back to town.
Careful on that trail. Huh?

52:58.910 --> 53:01.378
Mess you up good
unless you know it good.

53:17.128 --> 53:19.255
Hey, babe, where you been? Are you okay?

53:19.363 --> 53:20.830
Yeah.

53:20.932 --> 53:22.160
Where's Nicko at?

53:22.266 --> 53:25.565
Last time I saw him,
he was up in...

53:26.070 --> 53:28.038
I don't know,
over there.

53:39.449 --> 53:41.144
Well, look at that.

53:45.455 --> 53:48.219
Yeah, baby,
look at that.

53:50.460 --> 53:52.360
Hold this
for me, Cliff.

53:52.462 --> 53:55.829
One to the neck, I broke
it off. The body's clean.

53:57.334 --> 54:00.064
Okay, baby,
you are a man in full,

54:00.170 --> 54:03.628
but how's about putting the head
that way so the blood runs downhill

54:03.740 --> 54:05.503
instead of all over our
shit? Again, Cliff, thank you.

54:05.609 --> 54:07.668
Okay, and how's
about you make sure

54:07.777 --> 54:09.768
to cinch off
the esophagus this time

54:09.880 --> 54:11.313
so you don't
foul the meat?

54:11.414 --> 54:13.712
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
going to do this or am I?

54:15.685 --> 54:19.177
Hey, I ran into your friends.
They looked a little spooked.

54:19.289 --> 54:21.086
What did you say to them? Just...

54:21.191 --> 54:23.489
Hey, Cliff,
can I see that thing?

54:25.762 --> 54:27.059
Thank you.

54:30.100 --> 54:35.868
See, I spent a summer in the meat
department at the Piggly Wiggly,

54:35.972 --> 54:39.066
so this ain't
nothing to me.

54:39.476 --> 54:42.445
But if you're squeamish...

54:43.046 --> 54:46.106
You wanna get all the way
back here, the anus.

54:46.216 --> 54:48.514
And now what
you want to do is

54:48.618 --> 54:52.452
get the bag,
the gut bag, out.

54:54.558 --> 54:58.790
I mean, I find that more
interesting than gory, really.

55:02.432 --> 55:03.990
You guys hungry?

55:08.604 --> 55:10.595
You might wanna
bury that.

55:14.509 --> 55:15.567
Okay.

55:17.279 --> 55:21.909
These two have graduated to
the official crazy category.

55:22.017 --> 55:23.780
You know that, right?

55:24.253 --> 55:27.279
So, let's just pack our
bags and get out of here.

55:27.389 --> 55:29.289
We can make up
some excuse. We can...

55:29.391 --> 55:32.724
What, like what? Like, "We
think you're the killers?"

55:32.828 --> 55:34.523
No, but we can...

55:34.630 --> 55:37.360
We can say one of us doesn't
feel good or something.

55:37.466 --> 55:38.694
Look, we don't have to
go through with this.

55:38.800 --> 55:39.994
We can just
pack up our bags.

55:40.102 --> 55:41.535
Look, it was hard
enough getting in here.

55:41.637 --> 55:43.366
We can't just leave.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.569
What do you suggest?

55:50.178 --> 55:52.112
It's only two more
miles to the beach, right?

55:52.648 --> 55:54.081
Two long miles.

55:54.182 --> 55:57.811
I know, but I think we
have to ride this thing out.

55:58.987 --> 56:00.784
Keep Nick talking.

56:00.889 --> 56:02.322
Keep him thinking
he's going to be

56:02.424 --> 56:04.153
the star of some
Hollywood movie.

56:04.259 --> 56:08.252
Keep them both happy so that
everybody gets to the beach alive.

56:13.168 --> 56:15.329
But we keep
our game face on.

56:16.371 --> 56:18.999
Do not let them know
that anything is wrong here.

56:19.107 --> 56:23.567
Do you understand me?
Hey, do you understand me?

56:25.814 --> 56:27.441
Can you
hold that for me?

56:39.127 --> 56:42.221
I just thought we were
gonna have a real honeymoon.

56:50.706 --> 56:53.800
<i>Rise and shine.
It's your wake-up call.</i>

56:54.676 --> 56:56.337
<i>Out of the tent now.</i>

56:58.613 --> 57:00.137
<i>Outside now.</i>

57:02.351 --> 57:05.047
<i>We want to see
everybody's smiling face.</i>

57:09.091 --> 57:11.525
Shit! It was
only one goat.

57:24.339 --> 57:26.330
<i>This is
the Kauai County Police.</i>

57:26.441 --> 57:29.899
<i>We want you face down
on the ground now.</i>

57:34.082 --> 57:36.778
<i>We want to see your hands.
Show me your hands.</i>

57:38.819 --> 57:40.878
<i>I repeat. Do not...</i>

57:41.788 --> 57:43.551
These boys are
coming in heavy.

57:43.657 --> 57:46.990
You might want to hang back,
let them do their thing.

57:49.629 --> 57:51.824
Get down on
the ground! Fucking pigs!

57:51.932 --> 57:53.923
Fuck you messing
with us for, man?

57:54.034 --> 57:55.968
We ain't got nothing
to do with it, nothing!

57:59.239 --> 58:01.230
Let's hold it
right there.

58:03.844 --> 58:05.812
What the hell
did they do?

58:06.113 --> 58:07.341
Can't say.

58:07.447 --> 58:09.142
Fucking groping me!

58:11.151 --> 58:12.880
All right, man,
all right! Relax!

58:12.986 --> 58:15.784
Does it have something to do
with the murders on Honolulu?

58:16.723 --> 58:18.315
Really can't say.

58:19.226 --> 58:23.788
Wait a minute. It's those
guys! It's Kale and Cleo.

58:23.897 --> 58:25.262
They think it's them.

58:25.432 --> 58:28.128
Hey, baby, don't worry! Relax!
They ain't got nothing on us!

58:28.235 --> 58:30.396
I'm gonna sue
your fucking ass!

58:30.504 --> 58:32.699
Hey, go ahead, man.
Look all you want.

58:32.806 --> 58:35.673
Think there's a gun in
there? Show me a gun.

58:37.110 --> 58:38.737
Kale! Kale!

58:39.579 --> 58:42.343
We almost picked
these guys up in our car.

58:48.088 --> 58:51.683
Baby! Baby, don't let
them take me! Let me out!

59:03.537 --> 59:04.595
What the fuck, man?

59:05.839 --> 59:06.828
Wow.

59:10.877 --> 59:11.844
You know,
I have to admit,

59:11.945 --> 59:14.846
I thought it might
have been you guys.

59:15.815 --> 59:17.407
What? You're joking!

59:17.517 --> 59:19.417
So much for our
game face, huh?

59:20.020 --> 59:22.284
I can't believe it 'cause
I thought it was you.

59:22.389 --> 59:23.856
Oh, my God, it is!

59:27.661 --> 59:29.322
You! The killer.

59:52.185 --> 59:53.812
Well, whoopty-tah!

59:57.657 --> 59:59.852
Ample time to
sunset, too, huh?

01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:02.726
Outstanding.

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:08.191
Yes!

01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:12.862
Hey, you guys, can you get a shot
of us, in front of this rainbow?

01:00:13.006 --> 01:00:15.236
Baby, I look like hell.

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:17.003
Oh, come on.
No, you look great.

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:18.805
You're a good liar.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.269
All right,
here you go.

01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:22.541
Okay.

01:00:24.384 --> 01:00:25.908
Just point
and shoot it, huh?

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:27.008
Yeah.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.111
Okay. Rolling.
Go ahead.

01:00:29.222 --> 01:00:30.917
Hey.
Hey.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:35.524
We survived the trail and our honeymoon.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.025
Hut. Hut.

01:02:01.113 --> 01:02:01.875
Hey. Hey!

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.642
Hey, there's sea caves
down the coast.

01:02:04.749 --> 01:02:06.148
Yeah.

01:02:06.251 --> 01:02:09.118
Read about that. West-southwest,
around this point, I guess.

01:02:09.221 --> 01:02:10.654
Well, let's do it.

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:14.283
No, I cut a deal
with these guys.

01:02:14.392 --> 01:02:17.327
I got two kayaks,
one hour, 40 bucks.

01:02:17.729 --> 01:02:19.526
And, no, you don't owe me 20.

01:02:19.965 --> 01:02:21.796
Yeah, I just
got plans is all.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.865
What kind of plans
could you have?

01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:25.300
Covert plans.

01:02:25.403 --> 01:02:27.132
You do know how
to handle a kayak?

01:02:27.239 --> 01:02:29.730
Pallie, I've done
shark fishing in a kayak.

01:02:29.841 --> 01:02:31.706
Coast of Alaska.

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:33.243
Caught a 400-pound
salmon shark.

01:02:33.345 --> 01:02:35.779
He put up a hell of a fight, but
you know who's gonna win that battle.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:37.906
Nick, are any
of your stories true?

01:02:38.016 --> 01:02:39.847
You want me to send you pictures? Yeah.

01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:41.885
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

01:02:43.488 --> 01:02:46.753
Come on, it'll give us a chance
to talk about our movie deal.

01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:51.889
Cydney!

01:02:53.532 --> 01:02:56.865
Tell her I'll be back for
a sunset walk! Me and Gina.

01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:15.014
Where are they going?

01:03:20.025 --> 01:03:21.083
What?

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.752
The sea caves!
They won't be long!

01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:29.160
Son of a bitch.

01:04:48.813 --> 01:04:51.714
Nick! Wait! Don't go!

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:55.486
Come back!

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:57.818
Hey, what is she saying?

01:04:58.623 --> 01:04:59.920
I don't know.

01:05:00.358 --> 01:05:02.121
Come back, come back.

01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:04.990
She's got a nice bounce
to her, though, don't she?

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:06.788
Nick!

01:05:07.232 --> 01:05:09.359
Sunset!
I'm coming back!

01:05:10.568 --> 01:05:12.468
Damn it! Nick!

01:05:32.257 --> 01:05:35.124
Come on, come on, come on, come
on. Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:37.996 --> 01:05:39.987
Stupid hunk of shit!

01:06:18.503 --> 01:06:19.561
Shit!

01:06:36.154 --> 01:06:38.520
<i>What, are you
running out of gas?</i>

01:06:42.026 --> 01:06:44.324
Our own tactical
frequency, huh?

01:06:44.729 --> 01:06:47.698
<i>I just want to make sure
we get you back in time.</i>

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:49.528
Copy that. Jedi out.

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:50.929
<i>Jedi out.</i>

01:07:28.339 --> 01:07:29.704
Outstanding.

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:20.513
Shit. Where are you?

01:08:21.658 --> 01:08:24.492
Hey! Gotta ask you something.

01:08:26.163 --> 01:08:27.358
Shoot.

01:08:27.631 --> 01:08:28.826
What is that...

01:08:31.703 --> 01:08:34.365
"Shake that bush. ' '
What does that mean?

01:08:35.273 --> 01:08:36.604
Kidding me?

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:41.609
What, it's some
Special Ops lingo?

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:51.318
"What we've got here is
failure to communicate. ' '

01:08:55.059 --> 01:08:56.959
<i>It's Paul Newman
in Cool Hand Luke.</i>

01:08:57.228 --> 01:08:59.059
Right before he breaks
from the chain gang.

01:08:59.162 --> 01:09:00.926
You should know that.

01:09:01.599 --> 01:09:03.089
I should, yeah.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:20.242
He goes in alive.

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:50.147
Well, the stories
were great, Nick.

01:09:51.616 --> 01:09:53.109
They're really helpful.

01:09:53.216 --> 01:09:57.619
But your "situational awareness,"
it actually kind of sucks.

01:10:03.393 --> 01:10:04.883
Cliff?
Call me Nick.

01:11:14.597 --> 01:11:15.928
Rule number one?

01:11:18.234 --> 01:11:20.293
Never cut
forensics a break.

01:11:31.247 --> 01:11:33.738
<i>It always amazes me how
much people talk about themselves</i>

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:34.976
<i>when they're on vacation.</i>

01:11:35.084 --> 01:11:37.245
<i>Talk to people
they just met.</i>

01:11:40.023 --> 01:11:42.116
<i>It always amazes me how much
people talk about themselves</i>

01:11:42.225 --> 01:11:43.487
<i>when they're on vacation.</i>

01:11:43.659 --> 01:11:45.024
<i>Talk to people
they just met.</i>

01:11:46.396 --> 01:11:47.920
How did she say it?

01:11:48.898 --> 01:11:51.230
It always amazes me how much
people talk about themselves

01:11:51.334 --> 01:11:52.596
when they're on vacation.

01:11:52.835 --> 01:11:54.325
Talk to people
they just met.

01:11:56.139 --> 01:11:57.868
Wait. What was
the other one?

01:11:57.974 --> 01:11:59.373
Um...

01:11:59.675 --> 01:12:01.336
We say screenwriter.

01:12:01.811 --> 01:12:03.642
We say screenwriter.
Writer.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.445
We say screenwriter.

01:12:05.615 --> 01:12:07.446
I'm gonna give you
some looks.

01:12:09.419 --> 01:12:11.887
Yep, working on
a two-week punch-up.

01:12:12.088 --> 01:12:13.385
Oh.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:17.088
And we invited... I had
to invite my other sisters.

01:12:17.193 --> 01:12:18.785
You know,
my sorority sisters.

01:12:18.895 --> 01:12:20.920
<i>I basically
hooked them up.</i>

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:22.793
Check this out! Hello!

01:12:22.899 --> 01:12:25.925
Yeah, we're in
pre-production in Canada.

01:12:26.035 --> 01:12:28.299
<i>My little brother
getting married before me.</i>

01:12:28.671 --> 01:12:30.400
<i>Hey, bartender!
Another beer over here!</i>

01:12:30.506 --> 01:12:31.666
Hey, my brother's a dick!

01:12:31.774 --> 01:12:34.436
I don't know why I'm telling you
this. I just came here to dance.

01:12:34.544 --> 01:12:37.069
<i>You dance with who brung you,
Cliffie. You dance with who brung you.</i>

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.272
<i>I absolutely love you.</i>

01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:39.405
That's my friend.

01:12:39.515 --> 01:12:41.506
Just the most
magical weekend.

01:12:41.617 --> 01:12:43.312
<i>Our wedding haul!
Our wedding haul!</i>

01:12:43.453 --> 01:12:45.717
Magical. Magical.

01:12:53.296 --> 01:12:55.696
<i>This is the happiest day
of my life.</i>

01:13:08.144 --> 01:13:09.975
She was kind of
classy, huh?

01:13:10.646 --> 01:13:13.080
Hey, rule two,

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.108
keep your game face on.

01:13:20.156 --> 01:13:21.453
Come on, honey.

01:13:42.178 --> 01:13:45.011
Babe, get a picture of me
with Honolulu in the back.

01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:47.776
Uh, I have
a better idea.

01:13:47.884 --> 01:13:49.317
Come on, come on, come
on! Let's get the both of us.

01:13:49.418 --> 01:13:50.612
Right there!
It's right there!

01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:53.213
Excuse me.

01:13:53.322 --> 01:13:54.687
Come on, run, run!
We got to run!

01:13:55.791 --> 01:13:57.088
Wait, wait, wait!

01:13:57.193 --> 01:13:58.455
Oh, crap!

01:13:58.995 --> 01:14:00.019
Honolulu!

01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:01.596
Hawaii!

01:14:01.964 --> 01:14:03.795
We made it,
we made it!

01:14:04.367 --> 01:14:05.459
Shit.

01:14:08.137 --> 01:14:09.968
Maybe that wasn't
the one to Kauai.

01:14:10.273 --> 01:14:11.706
Pretty sure it was, doll,
baby. No, no, no, no.

01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:14.002
It was probably the one
to Maui, smaller boat.

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:15.839
We're looking for
something more substantial,

01:14:15.945 --> 01:14:17.105
something with
some big-ass...

01:14:17.213 --> 01:14:18.703
Wanna look
right there?

01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:20.509
Pretty sure it was.

01:14:20.616 --> 01:14:22.243
Let's see how much
time we need to kill.

01:14:22.351 --> 01:14:23.909
You know, if you were
so frigging smart,

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.351
you'd play stupid
once in a while.

01:14:25.454 --> 01:14:26.648
That'd be your job.

01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:31.884
Something
I can show you?

01:14:33.696 --> 01:14:39.532
Well, not me, but see that
dangerously handsome man over there?

01:14:39.936 --> 01:14:41.699
When he comes in here and
asks you what I was looking at,

01:14:41.804 --> 01:14:43.704
can you show him this ring?

01:14:43.839 --> 01:14:45.773
And that one.

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:49.375
And let's not deny him that
little rascal right there.

01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:53.215
Seems like he's more interested
in water sports right now.

01:14:53.349 --> 01:14:57.217
Well, that's just an operational
cover. Trust me, he is watching us.

01:14:57.753 --> 01:15:00.221
Any second now he's
going to come on in here,

01:15:00.323 --> 01:15:03.349
drag me out and
then forget something.

01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:05.856
Need to double back
and ask you all private-like

01:15:05.962 --> 01:15:07.793
what it was that
I was looking at.

01:15:07.964 --> 01:15:10.330
Been playing
this game a while?

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.037
Nicko. I love him to tears, but
he does take his own sweet time.

01:15:15.605 --> 01:15:17.505
Anytime, hon.

01:15:20.443 --> 01:15:22.934
You know what? Also, show
him that one right there.

01:15:23.112 --> 01:15:24.636
Okay. Just those four.

01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:28.673
Shit!
What?

01:15:28.884 --> 01:15:30.044
I left my drink.

01:15:30.286 --> 01:15:31.810
Well, let's go back and
get it. No, no, no, no.

01:15:31.921 --> 01:15:33.889
I'll get it. Here. Um...

01:15:35.524 --> 01:15:37.014
I'm sorry.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.691
It's okay.

01:15:40.162 --> 01:15:41.595
I'll wait right here.

01:15:45.935 --> 01:15:50.065
And let's not forget this
little rascal, right here.

01:15:52.575 --> 01:15:53.633
Phew!

01:15:53.943 --> 01:15:55.934
So, I take it you're
planning the next step?

01:15:56.045 --> 01:15:57.603
Oh, I got plans.

01:15:58.881 --> 01:16:00.576
Covert plans.

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:04.409
I'm going to make a sunset
proposal on Kalalau Beach.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.421
Okay, I just need to make sure
that this isn't going to be,

01:16:07.723 --> 01:16:09.953
you know, underwhelming
compared to whatever's stuck

01:16:10.059 --> 01:16:12.289
inside of that twangy
little head of hers.

01:16:12.995 --> 01:16:14.860
You know what?
Let me...

01:16:19.568 --> 01:16:21.263
Is that gonna work?

01:16:22.138 --> 01:16:23.867
If it's truly
gonna disappoint her,

01:16:23.973 --> 01:16:25.270
I'll roll over and
play dead for you.

01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:26.807
I'm gonna be the easiest
mark you ever had.

01:16:26.909 --> 01:16:28.934
Just please,
help me get it right.

01:16:29.178 --> 01:16:32.909
Gina is gonna be the first and
last for me. She is the one.

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:36.282
Well, to tell you
the truth,

01:16:40.056 --> 01:16:42.286
I think she'll love
anything you give her.

01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:44.052
So, you didn't
buy anything?

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.991
What would I want
to buy in there?

01:16:46.095 --> 01:16:47.653
I don't know.
I mean, you just...

01:16:47.763 --> 01:16:48.855
You know,
it took you so long,

01:16:48.964 --> 01:16:50.226
I was thinking
maybe they got you.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:52.028
No, no,
I got away clean.

01:16:52.168 --> 01:16:55.035
Hey, it's 1600.
We should catch that ferry.

01:16:59.308 --> 01:17:01.572
Where's your drink?
God damn it!

01:17:04.347 --> 01:17:07.077
No! You big dope.

01:17:11.687 --> 01:17:15.145
This is the scene right now in
the harbor area near Pier 19,

01:17:15.391 --> 01:17:17.723
where, late today,
a city trash collector

01:17:17.827 --> 01:17:20.921
stumbled across what appears
to be another double homicide.

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:23.692
Come on, this ain't got
nothing to do with us.

01:17:31.507 --> 01:17:34.772
Congratulations, Mr. Anderson.
It's part of the honeymoon package.

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:37.006
Thanks,
you're the best.

01:17:38.147 --> 01:17:39.205
Take this.

01:17:40.483 --> 01:17:43.350
<i>the main compound
used in gasoline additives,</i>

01:17:43.452 --> 01:17:45.647
<i>like the one Irene
allegedly swallowed.</i>

01:17:45.988 --> 01:17:48.252
<i>The forensic investigation
continues.</i>

01:17:48.357 --> 01:17:50.723
<i>Examiners analyzed
Irene's blood samples</i>

01:17:50.826 --> 01:17:52.760
<i>by using a gas...</i>

01:17:53.295 --> 01:17:54.990
Fucking repeat.

01:18:20.923 --> 01:18:22.413
Tell me it'll never end.

01:18:24.093 --> 01:18:25.458
It'll end.

01:18:26.762 --> 01:18:29.856
Trick is to have
more starts than ends,

01:18:30.199 --> 01:18:35.193
keep this whole C- world
always playing catch-up.

01:18:41.677 --> 01:18:43.577
All I wanna do is
catch up on my sleep.

01:18:45.748 --> 01:18:46.772
Rule number three...

01:18:46.882 --> 01:18:48.509
Go away with your rules.

01:18:48.851 --> 01:18:51.445
Okay? Nothing is getting me
off this balcony today.

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.024
You are such
an incredible asshole.

01:18:57.126 --> 01:18:58.457
Asshole!

01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:03.320
Hey, never wear the same
skin too long. Keep moving.

01:19:07.036 --> 01:19:10.494
Hey, baby, look, it's Kale and
Cleo getting married in Oahu.

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:13.539
Suitable for framing.

01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:18.174
While we're
still young, Cliff.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.304
One sec.

01:19:23.586 --> 01:19:25.053
Here's your permits.

01:19:25.154 --> 01:19:28.248
I'm gonna head on back to town.
Careful on that trail. Huh?

01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:31.082
Mess you up good
unless you know it good.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.925
Hey, wait a minute.

01:19:33.028 --> 01:19:36.191
Hey, maybe you are allowed
to carry guns out here.

01:19:36.398 --> 01:19:38.423
Guns? No, no.
Who got guns?

01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:41.764
A guy named Kale,
runs with a girl named Cleo.

01:19:42.104 --> 01:19:46.234
I think it was a 9mm. I'm not
too good at these things, so...

01:19:46.342 --> 01:19:49.675
Maybe when you get back you can
tell somebody about it, okay?

01:19:50.279 --> 01:19:52.804
Let the cops decide
if it's important or not.

01:19:53.716 --> 01:19:56.310
You keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

01:19:56.652 --> 01:19:59.177
Keep shaking
that bush, Luke!

01:20:00.489 --> 01:20:02.480
What is this idiot
talking about?

01:20:06.462 --> 01:20:09.625
I say we let Nick keep
pitching his stories,

01:20:10.266 --> 01:20:12.029
let him dig
his own grave.

01:20:13.369 --> 01:20:16.805
This isn't Honolulu, and he's not
some soft-boy screenplay writer.

01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:19.966
What? You actually
buy this Jedi shit?

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:24.036
Gets his skull opened by a
landmine and just walks it off?

01:20:24.146 --> 01:20:25.204
He's trying to
impress me.

01:20:25.314 --> 01:20:28.340
Me, because he thinks that I'm
gonna make a movie about his life.

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:31.510
Everything becomes
exaggerated and overblown.

01:20:32.021 --> 01:20:34.353
Trust me. I know a
narcissist when I see one.

01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:36.716
This guy, amateur hour.

01:20:37.293 --> 01:20:38.658
Screenwriter.

01:20:39.261 --> 01:20:42.162
I don't know. If half
his stories are true...

01:20:42.264 --> 01:20:43.424
Look.

01:20:43.799 --> 01:20:47.291
I know exactly what he is.
He has no clue what I am.

01:20:47.403 --> 01:20:49.564
That's the advantage
that we exploit.

01:20:51.407 --> 01:20:53.034
We'll do it
on the beach.

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:55.366
There'll be people there.

01:20:56.078 --> 01:20:57.204
So?

01:20:57.313 --> 01:20:58.905
I just think
we're rushing.

01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:03.848
Don't tell me you're
starting to like Gina.

01:21:04.453 --> 01:21:06.785
See, that's
your mistake.

01:21:06.956 --> 01:21:08.480
You get too close.
You get too attached.

01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:10.718
Maybe I'm starting
to like Cydney.

01:21:11.827 --> 01:21:13.021
Bigger mistake.

01:21:15.331 --> 01:21:16.525
She's a nice girl.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:21.633
Now, I want you to start thinking about
me the way Cliff would think of her.

01:21:21.737 --> 01:21:23.068
Even if it's not real,

01:21:23.172 --> 01:21:26.232
even if you're physically
incapable of feeling anything,

01:21:29.078 --> 01:21:30.841
I'd like you to
pretend that part, too.

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:41.212
We're supposed to be
on our honeymoon. Okay?

01:21:41.323 --> 01:21:44.520
This is one of the most beautiful
places on Earth, rain or shine.

01:21:44.627 --> 01:21:48.495
So, slow down that
overactive brain of yours.

01:21:48.597 --> 01:21:50.155
I want to enjoy
myself here.

01:21:52.835 --> 01:21:56.066
Babe, we're gonna be fine.

01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:22.356
Sometimes it seems like
nothing exists until we get there,

01:22:22.464 --> 01:22:24.261
until we put our eyes on it.

01:22:24.366 --> 01:22:26.960
Like the whole fucking
world was manufactured

01:22:27.069 --> 01:22:29.469
for our wants
and needs, you know?

01:22:33.776 --> 01:22:34.868
Think it'll be
a nice sunset?

01:22:34.977 --> 01:22:36.501
I mean, like, if I take...

01:22:36.612 --> 01:22:41.015
If I just turn my head, you
know, for just a minute and...

01:22:41.116 --> 01:22:44.244
But don't tell me. But
does everything just stop?

01:22:44.453 --> 01:22:50.483
Just shut down, go into some
energy-saving hibernation mode

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.652
till I choose to
reactivate them by simply...

01:22:59.435 --> 01:23:02.131
You should say sweet
stuff to me sometimes.

01:23:02.304 --> 01:23:04.465
Look at this.
Look at this.

01:23:04.673 --> 01:23:07.107
I mean, fucking idiots, man.

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:09.468
Just say it.

01:23:09.578 --> 01:23:12.069
How many times
do I need to tell you?

01:23:12.414 --> 01:23:16.077
If there's anyone in this world
that I could love, it's you.

01:23:16.552 --> 01:23:18.349
Why is that never enough?

01:23:18.454 --> 01:23:19.944
Just forget about it.

01:23:27.396 --> 01:23:32.561
Look, you helped create this
fevered dream of immortality.

01:23:33.235 --> 01:23:35.760
You are
the privileged witness

01:23:35.871 --> 01:23:39.272
who's going to help me
lead 100 different lives.

01:23:49.218 --> 01:23:51.277
How about this
for a new rule?

01:23:52.888 --> 01:23:56.119
Always be sincere
even if you're not.

01:23:58.727 --> 01:24:01.252
I know that
in some bent way

01:24:01.363 --> 01:24:04.355
your need for detachment
fits my need for attachment.

01:24:04.466 --> 01:24:05.490
That's it.

01:24:05.601 --> 01:24:08.968
It's fitting fuck and a
fucking fit. I get it, okay?

01:24:10.506 --> 01:24:12.997
Let's stop lying
to ourselves, okay?

01:24:17.746 --> 01:24:19.373
I'm not lying now.

01:24:19.915 --> 01:24:22.110
I love the idea
of loving you.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.351
And I love hearing it.

01:24:30.559 --> 01:24:32.459
It's sick and it's sad.

01:24:37.366 --> 01:24:39.391
Does that make
me crazy, Rocky?

01:24:39.501 --> 01:24:41.435
Am I crazy? Am I?

01:24:42.304 --> 01:24:44.465
It makes you exciting.

01:25:04.927 --> 01:25:06.588
Well, whoopty-tah.

01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:14.028
Outstanding.

01:25:18.606 --> 01:25:20.471
No!

01:27:25.533 --> 01:27:26.591
Nick!

01:27:33.607 --> 01:27:34.665
Nick!

01:29:01.928 --> 01:29:03.293
Who is this?

01:29:03.696 --> 01:29:04.993
<i>Hello, my name is Woody</i>

01:29:05.097 --> 01:29:06.928
<i>and I'm calling to make sure
you're getting the most</i>

01:29:07.033 --> 01:29:09.228
<i>out of your AT& T calling
plan. Sweet, flaming Jesus,</i>

01:29:09.335 --> 01:29:10.802
you don't work
the whole time.

01:29:10.903 --> 01:29:12.427
Where're you at?
What state are you in?

01:29:12.605 --> 01:29:14.129
<i>I'm not supposed to say.</i>

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.073
Okay, Woody, there's been
some murders in Honolulu.

01:29:17.176 --> 01:29:19.076
Maybe you've heard,
maybe you haven't.

01:29:19.178 --> 01:29:21.203
But they are coming after
me and I need your help.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:24.750
Can you do this for me,
Woody? Woody, are you there?

01:29:25.918 --> 01:29:27.852
<i>I hear your
concerns, Madam,</i>

01:29:27.954 --> 01:29:30.081
<i>but with our free-to-roam
plan, we can offer you</i>

01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:31.952
<i>more minutes regardless
of the time of day...</i>

01:29:32.058 --> 01:29:34.686
Screw the calling plan
and listen to me good, okay?

01:29:34.794 --> 01:29:37.558
You're going to be
my 911 boy, okay, Woody?

01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:40.962
All right. I need you to call the
Princeville, Kauai Police Department,

01:29:41.067 --> 01:29:43.695
and you tell them that
I can have the killers

01:29:43.803 --> 01:29:46.601
to the Kalalau Beach
in about 30 minutes.

01:29:46.906 --> 01:29:50.034
Can you do that
for me? Woody!

01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:52.077
<i>I'm placing you
on a brief hold.</i>

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:53.975
No! No, you do not
put me on hold!

01:29:54.146 --> 01:29:55.943
You do not check
with your supervisor.

01:29:56.048 --> 01:29:58.209
I need you to
just do it! Okay?

01:29:58.317 --> 01:30:00.148
And I also need you
to maybe call

01:30:00.252 --> 01:30:02.686
for some air ambulance
or something because...

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:08.953
<i>Hello?</i>

01:30:09.829 --> 01:30:11.262
<i>Hello, Madam?</i>

01:30:12.698 --> 01:30:13.824
<i>Hello?</i>

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:15.732
Please tell me that
you will do this for me.

01:30:15.835 --> 01:30:17.097
Please, please,
please, please.

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:19.103
Swear to me that you will.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:21.105
<i>This is in the Pacific Ocean?</i>

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:22.299
Jesus!

01:30:22.408 --> 01:30:23.739
God, I hope you're
recording this call!

01:30:23.843 --> 01:30:25.401
Yes, it is
in the Pacific Ocean!

01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:28.771
<i>- Yes, it is one of the five islands!
- More to the left.</i>

01:30:30.483 --> 01:30:32.951
I'm on Kauai,
in the Hawaiian

01:30:33.052 --> 01:30:35.714
<i>chain of islands.
More.</i>

01:30:36.455 --> 01:30:39.618
<i>You are almost there.
A little more, baby.</i>

01:30:40.459 --> 01:30:41.824
<i>Right there.</i>

01:32:03.342 --> 01:32:04.468
Bitch!

01:32:10.616 --> 01:32:11.981
She got a call off!

01:32:12.084 --> 01:32:14.575
<i>Ask for help
back at the beach!</i>

01:32:15.387 --> 01:32:18.447
<i>Remember, nothing exists
until we get there.</i>

01:32:18.557 --> 01:32:19.717
Got it.

01:32:20.059 --> 01:32:24.086
But, Rocky, nothing
exists until I get there.

01:33:30.663 --> 01:33:31.925
Here I come, baby.

01:34:20.945 --> 01:34:22.606
Whoa, whoa!

01:34:22.713 --> 01:34:24.544
Didn't mean to scare you. But
you haven't seen two dudes,

01:34:24.648 --> 01:34:26.639
two kayaks?
He shot my boyfriend!

01:34:26.751 --> 01:34:28.013
He shot me
in the fucking hand.

01:34:28.119 --> 01:34:29.586
So, let's just go back to
the beach. Let me see that.

01:34:29.687 --> 01:34:30.711
No! Let go of me! Let go!

01:34:30.821 --> 01:34:31.810
Hey, listen to me.
I'm an EMT. Okay?

01:34:31.922 --> 01:34:33.355
I don't care who you are.
If you let me take a look,

01:34:33.457 --> 01:34:35.049
I can help you. Let's get
her down. I need to go, okay?

01:34:35.159 --> 01:34:37.150
'Cause he is right behind
me. No! Let me... No!

01:34:37.261 --> 01:34:38.660
Hold on. Calm down.

01:34:38.763 --> 01:34:40.025
Come here.
Come here, come here.

01:34:40.131 --> 01:34:42.531
Let me take
a look at that shot.

01:34:42.633 --> 01:34:44.294
Okay. Okay, I'll go down.
You're in shock, okay?

01:34:44.402 --> 01:34:45.630
I'll go down.
Calm down. Calm down.

01:34:49.907 --> 01:34:51.238
Okay, and there's
going to be help...

01:34:51.342 --> 01:34:52.570
Hey!

01:34:53.177 --> 01:34:55.077
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get her, get her.

01:34:55.179 --> 01:34:57.010
Put her down. Listen to me! You're safe!

01:34:57.114 --> 01:34:58.513
Calm down.

01:34:58.649 --> 01:35:00.640
He was right behind
me just a minute ago.

01:35:00.751 --> 01:35:02.480
You don't understand.
Who are you talking about?

01:35:02.586 --> 01:35:03.644
He...

01:35:04.922 --> 01:35:07.186
Gina?
You feeling better?

01:35:07.691 --> 01:35:08.715
Huh?

01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:33.707
Hey!

01:35:35.386 --> 01:35:36.410
Hey!

01:35:37.588 --> 01:35:39.146
Relax. Relax. We need
to go right now, okay?

01:35:39.256 --> 01:35:40.518
Do you hear me?

01:35:40.624 --> 01:35:44.583
She's a friend of my wife. She has
a little issue with crystal meth.

01:35:44.695 --> 01:35:46.856
Okay? Normally
she's pretty functional,

01:35:46.964 --> 01:35:48.864
but obviously
this ain't normal.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.295
He killed my Nicko!

01:35:52.103 --> 01:35:53.263
Come on!

01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.702
He wants to be us!
That's what he wants, okay?

01:35:55.806 --> 01:35:57.967
Him and his girlfriend
want to be us!

01:35:58.075 --> 01:36:01.374
She's iced out of her mind right
now. I mean it's been a whole...

01:36:01.479 --> 01:36:03.538
Look, look, look,
look. Come here.

01:36:03.647 --> 01:36:05.410
No. No, no, no.
Don't go by him.

01:36:05.516 --> 01:36:06.813
Don't go. Don't go.

01:36:06.917 --> 01:36:08.043
Look at this.

01:36:08.752 --> 01:36:10.413
I've been finding
these the whole trip.

01:36:10.521 --> 01:36:12.546
I think she just got in
over her head this time.

01:36:12.656 --> 01:36:15.625
So, I hope we don't have to involve
the police or anything like that.

01:36:15.759 --> 01:36:18.125
I mean, I promise I'll
get her back safe, okay?

01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:20.163
Don't listen to him!
Don't listen to him!

01:36:20.264 --> 01:36:21.356
Look, man, we're
just out here because

01:36:21.465 --> 01:36:23.194
someone took off
with two of our boats.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.925
The last thing we want is to get
involved in somebody else's mess.

01:36:26.036 --> 01:36:27.196
Okay. Cool.
Right?

01:36:27.304 --> 01:36:28.737
Yeah, right.
Cool.

01:36:28.839 --> 01:36:30.830
Except...
Except what?

01:36:31.008 --> 01:36:34.739
You know, it's just that I don't
get why her pupils are normal

01:36:34.845 --> 01:36:36.403
and yours are
the size of olives.

01:36:42.252 --> 01:36:45.449
Guys, that was
a perfectly good story.

01:36:58.035 --> 01:37:01.937
Fuck! Count your
fucking shots! Gina, hey!

01:37:16.953 --> 01:37:18.113
No way.

01:38:10.273 --> 01:38:11.399
Nicko.

01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:24.944
How many people?

01:38:25.855 --> 01:38:27.823
Enough to get good at it.

01:38:28.324 --> 01:38:30.258
I bit
my tongue. I hate that.

01:38:30.359 --> 01:38:32.384
That's going to stop
hurting in a second.

01:38:32.495 --> 01:38:35.589
Oh, why, Nick?
You think this is it, huh?

01:38:35.698 --> 01:38:37.791
Bad guy buys it,
crowd goes nuts.

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:41.301
You know what I hate about that
ending, aside from it being cliché?

01:38:41.404 --> 01:38:44.840
It's your version of
reality, pallie. Not mine!

01:38:48.844 --> 01:38:52.610
It would feel so good to squeeze
that trigger right now, wouldn't it?

01:38:52.715 --> 01:38:53.909
Yeah.

01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:00.015
But you kill me,
you kill yourself.

01:39:00.122 --> 01:39:01.316
<i>This is
the Hawaii County Police.</i>

01:39:01.424 --> 01:39:02.584
You ain't
going to do that.

01:39:02.692 --> 01:39:06.651
<i>Weapons down.
Put your weapons down!</i>

01:39:06.929 --> 01:39:08.692
You've got
too much to live for.

01:39:08.798 --> 01:39:10.527
You've got
too many attachments.

01:39:10.633 --> 01:39:14.160
You're just too soft! Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:16.295
It's the guy standing
with the weapon, correct?

01:39:16.405 --> 01:39:19.101
He is the one you
told us about, correct?

01:39:20.042 --> 01:39:22.840
<i>The area is closed.
All trails are blocked.</i>

01:39:22.945 --> 01:39:24.435
Come on, Nick!
Come on! Do it!

01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:25.672
<i>I said drop all weapons.</i>

01:39:25.781 --> 01:39:27.373
If you don't kill me,
I'll just come back!

01:39:27.483 --> 01:39:29.781
These fucking idiots
can't keep me locked up!

01:39:29.885 --> 01:39:31.147
Hey, hey!
One year from today.

01:39:31.253 --> 01:39:34.347
Honolulu, Pier 19, okay?
Around noon. Be there!

01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:37.088
Weapon ready.

01:39:37.326 --> 01:39:38.315
Someone's going
to brush by you,

01:39:38.427 --> 01:39:39.621
maybe give you
a little nudge.

01:39:39.729 --> 01:39:41.720
They might not
look like me. Okay?

01:39:41.831 --> 01:39:44.095
Might look a little
something like you.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.633
Circle the date, Nick,

01:39:45.735 --> 01:39:48.101
because that is the day
that you're going to realize

01:39:48.204 --> 01:39:50.604
just how good
I really fucking am!

01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:53.208
I have to know I'm about
to kill the right man.

01:39:53.342 --> 01:39:54.809
Now, is he
the one I want?

01:39:56.545 --> 01:39:59.514
Come on! Do it! Just
do it. Come on. Do it!

01:40:00.216 --> 01:40:01.444
Do it.

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:05.653
Outstanding!

01:40:11.894 --> 01:40:13.122
Get away.

01:40:13.829 --> 01:40:15.091
Get away.

01:40:15.631 --> 01:40:16.859
Get away.

01:40:18.801 --> 01:40:21.827
Don't die on me. Don't
die on me again. Christ.

01:40:30.446 --> 01:40:32.914
I would have done it
if I were you.

01:40:43.092 --> 01:40:44.821
Well, you ain't him.

01:41:03.579 --> 01:41:05.171
The one you want,

01:41:07.216 --> 01:41:09.707
the one who killed
all those people

01:41:10.953 --> 01:41:13.717
and the one that
I let fuck up my life

01:41:15.524 --> 01:41:20.484
is the same guy who's
about to pick up that gun.

01:41:32.274 --> 01:41:33.866
Yeah. Him.

01:41:58.768 --> 01:42:00.599
What are you doing?

01:42:00.703 --> 01:42:01.863
It's all right.

01:42:06.809 --> 01:42:08.367
This is for you.

01:42:10.813 --> 01:42:12.110
Holy crap.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.850
Did you get it from
that store in Honolulu?

01:42:20.956 --> 01:42:22.218
EBay.

01:42:23.692 --> 01:42:24.750
EBay.

01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:30.398
How long
have you had it?

01:42:32.234 --> 01:42:33.758
A year and a half.

01:42:33.869 --> 01:42:35.200
A year and a half?

01:42:35.771 --> 01:42:38.899
Well, what are you waiting
for, you dumb bastard?

01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:41.467
The right moment.

01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:51.349
Baby, you are
a man in full.

01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:09.537
Wait a second.

01:43:17.379 --> 01:43:20.644
Let's not do a honeymoon.
I don't need no honeymoon.
