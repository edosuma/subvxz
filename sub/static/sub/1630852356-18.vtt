08:29.920 --> 08:30.959
What? Hey!

08:30.960 --> 08:32.789
- [tires squeal]
- [coughs]

08:32.790 --> 08:34.789
A few weeks later,
they met again

08:34.790 --> 08:36.959
on the rainiest day
of the summer.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.879
Huh?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.879
That's when Gramma realized
it's nice to accept

08:40.880 --> 08:42.880
somebody's help once in a while.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.419
But that wasn't the last time

08:50.420 --> 08:52.079
your grampa managed
to surprise her.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.710
Hm?

08:55.380 --> 08:57.420
[gasps and chuckles]

08:59.380 --> 09:01.749
[grunts and gasps]

09:01.750 --> 09:03.829
He had fixed Gramma's car up
so good,

09:03.830 --> 09:05.879
it looked brand-new.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.169
[gasps and laughs]

09:08.170 --> 09:11.249
[Grampa]
Ahem. Uh, Alice?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.749
Your Grandpa didn't
have enough money for a ring,

09:13.750 --> 09:16.829
so he offered the most
precious thing he had.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.829
Your mother's pearls.

09:18.830 --> 09:21.169
Alice, will you marry me?

09:21.170 --> 09:22.619
Oh, my gosh, yes!

09:22.620 --> 09:24.329
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

09:24.330 --> 09:26.209
But you're taking my last name.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.499
Okay.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.829
Come here, you.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.039
Whoa!

09:30.040 --> 09:32.120
All right, now slap them on me.

09:34.380 --> 09:36.249
And that's the story
of how Gramma and Grampa Green

09:36.250 --> 09:37.619
fell in love.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.669
[sighs]

09:39.670 --> 09:43.039
Dad was a great guy, but he
wasn't some swashbuckling hero.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.830
Ha. He was to me.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.749
Wow, Gramma,

09:48.750 --> 09:50.669
you never told us
Grampa had such cool stuff.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.039
Oh, how dashing.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.419
What else is in here?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.209
[both laugh]

09:55.210 --> 09:57.250
- Oh, dang, check this out.
- Cricket! No!

10:02.080 --> 10:03.670
[sighs]
