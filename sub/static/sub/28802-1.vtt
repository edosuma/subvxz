<i>Judge Giannini's
sentence climaxes a story of extremes,</i>

01:16.976 --> 01:21.078
<i>the maximum penalty and the longest
criminal trial in Rhode Island history</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:24.016
<i>for the second largest
robbery in US history.</i>

01:36.528 --> 01:39.765
<i>All of which will be fodder for
conversation for some time to come,</i>

01:40.265 --> 01:43.635
<i>as will the question,
"Whatever happened to most of the loot?"</i>

01:44.203 --> 01:45.602
<i>Michael Owens, News Watch.</i>

01:45.604 --> 01:48.138
<i>Well, the Bonded Vault
situation was a...</i>

01:48.140 --> 01:51.040
<i>more of a safety deposit box
type of thing.</i>

01:51.042 --> 01:54.043
<i>And when people put
their items in the vault,</i>

01:54.045 --> 01:57.046
<i>they didn't mark them,
and there was no way of telling</i>

01:57.048 --> 02:00.249
<i>to whom a particular
bag of coins would belong.</i>

02:00.251 --> 02:02.185
<i>These are nice.
These are real nice gifts.</i>

02:02.187 --> 02:03.688
<i>Are they silver?
Are they silver, Al?</i>

02:04.557 --> 02:06.726
<i>Yes, yes, they are.
Silver medallions.</i>

02:15.900 --> 02:19.169
<i>Well, I can't, at this
time, disclose their names.</i>

02:19.171 --> 02:20.736
<i>That will come out
in evidence...</i>

02:20.738 --> 02:22.205
<i>- Are they local people?
- No.</i>

02:22.207 --> 02:24.608
<i>They are not local people.
I can tell you</i>

02:24.610 --> 02:27.612
<i>the majority of them come from
the southern part of this country.</i>

03:39.917 --> 03:41.283
You ready?

03:41.285 --> 03:42.821
Let's boogie.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.188
- Forgot your mask.
- I don't need one. Let's go.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.159
Hold on, hold on.
You're really not gonna wear a mask?

03:49.327 --> 03:51.063
There ain't no point
in wearing that mask.

03:53.965 --> 03:57.401
When we walk in there and you
stick a gun in someone's face,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.273
they piss their pants,
they don't remember details.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.372
But I'm hearing about banks
out in California, right?

04:03.374 --> 04:06.177
They're startin' to use cameras to
monitor the buildings. They are.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.147
They're startin'
to do that now.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.882
I just wish... you know?

04:12.150 --> 04:14.653
First of all,
this ain't California.

04:15.219 --> 04:17.822
Second,
when we walk in there,

04:18.824 --> 04:21.725
all they're thinking is,
"Please, God,

04:21.726 --> 04:24.597
I ain't never taken the
kids to Niagara Falls."

04:25.297 --> 04:28.298
They ain't gonna remember
the shape of your nose

04:28.300 --> 04:30.302
or the color of
your fuckin' curly hair.

04:31.035 --> 04:31.937
Okay?

04:32.838 --> 04:33.806
You have a point.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.809
I know I do.
That's why I said it.

04:37.242 --> 04:38.744
Wait.

04:39.944 --> 04:42.213
So now I got a mask on
and you don't.

04:49.754 --> 04:50.822
Chucky...

04:51.790 --> 04:54.324
I been robbing
a long time.

04:54.326 --> 04:56.028
You been robbing
a long time.

04:56.895 --> 04:58.864
I ain't never worn
a fuckin' mask.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.133
I ain't gonna
wear one today.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.067
But if you wanna wear
that mask,

05:04.069 --> 05:06.706
please...
go right the fuck ahead.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.010
Nah.

05:18.216 --> 05:21.920
Now you can breathe better,
you can see all around you.

05:22.386 --> 05:24.487
And when we step out
of this car,

05:24.489 --> 05:26.889
you're not some fuckin'
lunatic with a ski mask on

05:26.891 --> 05:28.159
in broad daylight.

05:30.896 --> 05:31.997
Yeah.

05:34.299 --> 05:35.400
Can we go?

05:36.067 --> 05:37.168
'Course we can.

05:37.836 --> 05:39.071
Fuck you waiting for?

05:51.783 --> 05:54.986
Chucky and I met when I was...
when I was 15.

05:59.557 --> 06:01.360
Been fuckin' thick
as thieves since.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.562
He got in some fuckin' fight,

06:06.564 --> 06:08.132
and people got impressed by it.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.372
To be honest, we didn't really
know what we were getting into.

06:33.324 --> 06:35.894
- After you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

06:40.432 --> 06:42.234
Stay still!
Don't even think about it.

06:44.035 --> 06:47.405
- You hear me? Don't move a fucking inch.
- Let's remain calm, please.

06:48.874 --> 06:50.473
No need to take this
to a violent place.

06:50.475 --> 06:52.408
No, no, no.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.280
We know all about the safe in
the back of this establishment.

06:55.848 --> 06:59.117
We'll open it up,
take a peek inside.

07:00.151 --> 07:01.152
<i>Capisce?</i>

07:02.319 --> 07:04.723
This will all be over quick,
ladies and germs.

07:05.523 --> 07:07.358
Get this over your head,
darlin'.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.028
You, put this on.

07:10.395 --> 07:12.498
- You...
- Is that loaded?

07:13.264 --> 07:16.000
- Are you a comedian?
- Do what they say, Karyn. Let's get 'em out.

07:16.367 --> 07:19.502
It's no problem, just as long as
he gets that piece out of my face.

07:19.504 --> 07:21.941
I don't need to get killed
if this fool gets scared.

07:27.045 --> 07:28.511
Oh, I'm scared?

07:28.513 --> 07:29.882
That's what
you're worried about?

07:30.415 --> 07:31.751
You seem jumpy.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.159
Are you happy now?

07:41.292 --> 07:42.427
Sit on the floor.

07:43.528 --> 07:44.929
Oh, my God!

07:48.165 --> 07:50.069
Here, put this
pillowcase on.

07:52.237 --> 07:53.172
Jesus.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.307
Be right back.

08:00.444 --> 08:03.848
There she is.
Come on. Combination.

08:04.249 --> 08:05.217
Uhh!

08:08.119 --> 08:10.790
You oughta be careful with that
attitude of yours, you know.

08:11.122 --> 08:12.290
Anybody ever tell you that?

08:13.258 --> 08:14.426
Walking around like that,

08:15.893 --> 08:17.562
you're gonna mouth off to the
wrong person one of these days.

08:18.329 --> 08:19.831
Are you the wrong person?

08:21.098 --> 08:23.968
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

08:25.069 --> 08:28.239
Shit like that is provocative to a
guy like me in a situation like this.

08:28.573 --> 08:30.543
What kind of situation
is this?

08:32.577 --> 08:35.711
This... This is a tense...
situation.

08:35.712 --> 08:37.980
- It is?
- All right.

08:37.982 --> 08:39.484
Purses and wallets!

08:43.054 --> 08:43.955
Hurry up.

08:46.324 --> 08:47.559
Give me your purse.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.198
No.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.099
I got exactly enough money in
this purse for my bus fare home.

08:56.101 --> 08:58.268
- So what?
- So I don't give a shit

08:58.270 --> 09:01.273
if you rob that sweaty old white
man's safe and his whole store.

09:01.606 --> 09:04.506
But if you think you can come in
here, take all that,

09:04.508 --> 09:06.277
and get my bus fare today,

09:07.878 --> 09:09.711
then you'd better plan on returning
to the scene of the crime at 6:00

09:09.713 --> 09:13.618
and giving me a ride home, because it is
certainly too far to walk in these shoes.

09:17.421 --> 09:18.923
Okay.

09:20.025 --> 09:22.026
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:25.262 --> 09:27.730
- Time to say good-bye, friends.
- I'll see you at 6:00.

09:27.732 --> 09:29.133
That's what time
you get off, right?

09:29.668 --> 09:31.270
No, thank you.
I have a boyfriend.

09:33.538 --> 09:35.007
He ain't invited.

09:35.439 --> 09:36.507
Sorry.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.410
Here's the deal,
ladies and germs.

09:41.011 --> 09:42.448
We're gonna walk out that door
now while counting to 100.

09:43.781 --> 09:46.282
And while we count,
we're gonna have our guns trained

09:46.284 --> 09:47.716
on the windows of this establish...

09:47.718 --> 09:50.253
Fuck.

09:50.255 --> 09:51.991
- You shot him?
- You shot him?

09:52.491 --> 09:54.260
It's not like
I meant to do it.

09:55.359 --> 09:56.527
Fuck that, let's go!

10:13.811 --> 10:18.114
Pasquale. Hey, Pasquale,
what are you doing with this bread, huh?

10:18.116 --> 10:19.550
What are you doing
with the bread?

10:20.519 --> 10:21.420
Huh?

10:22.521 --> 10:24.622
Let's see what Gerry Ouimette
has to say.

10:29.227 --> 10:30.194
<i>Padrino...</i>

10:32.329 --> 10:33.299
Raymond.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.471
I've earned with the family
for... many, many years.

10:41.772 --> 10:43.942
I treat your family
like it's my family.

10:46.243 --> 10:48.046
You know
I've been loyal to you.

10:49.814 --> 10:52.050
Some say loyalty
is all we ever had.

10:53.751 --> 10:56.354
With that I agree.

10:57.389 --> 10:58.324
You and I,

10:59.391 --> 11:01.025
we live by the same code,

11:03.761 --> 11:05.698
one I respect with my life.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.636
Nixon was obsessed
with loyalty, you know.

11:12.370 --> 11:13.672
He learned that from us.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.742
Quaker shit-for-brains.

11:18.376 --> 11:21.144
Thought he could cover his ass with
a pledge like a fucking Boy Scout.

11:21.146 --> 11:22.412
Fuck Nixon.

11:26.650 --> 11:28.252
I respect you, Raymond.

11:30.554 --> 11:33.525
I respect the family
and what you've built.

11:34.425 --> 11:36.194
And after all these
many years,

11:37.628 --> 11:39.664
I'm thinkin'
maybe it's time...

11:42.367 --> 11:43.899
I got some respect, too.

11:43.901 --> 11:47.336
Respect. What kind of respect
are you talking about?

11:47.338 --> 11:48.239
Huh?

11:49.774 --> 11:51.243
I wanna be made.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.414
I know I'm not Italian,

11:57.181 --> 11:59.550
but I want you to accept me
into your family.

12:00.618 --> 12:01.719
I've been loyal.

12:04.421 --> 12:05.490
I've done...

12:08.459 --> 12:09.360
things.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.697
I want a claim
to what I've earned

12:15.699 --> 12:18.302
that cannot be challenged
and is understood.

12:27.679 --> 12:29.415
You see this mouse here?

12:33.251 --> 12:34.285
Heh.

12:36.353 --> 12:37.555
He comes here every day.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.324
I give him some bread.

12:41.793 --> 12:43.262
I trained him, you know.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.099
He thinks we're friends.

12:48.666 --> 12:49.667
His name is Pasquale.

12:50.669 --> 12:51.569
Pasquale.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.671
Do you think Gerry Ouimette
is one of us?

13:00.511 --> 13:02.146
Oh, wow.

13:02.847 --> 13:04.516
Pasquale agrees with you.

13:06.984 --> 13:08.653
He says you're one of us.

13:11.256 --> 13:12.956
But Pasquale is wrong.

13:19.930 --> 13:23.669
You got as much chance of being one
of us as this little mouse right here.

13:24.401 --> 13:27.473
You keep pissing and moaning,
you're gonna end up just like him.

13:28.573 --> 13:30.809
I'll break your fuckin' back
and never blink an eye.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.146
Okay, Frenchman?

13:51.795 --> 13:53.397
May I offer you a ride?

13:55.900 --> 13:57.803
Do you really have
a boyfriend?

13:59.503 --> 14:01.772
You know, you really shouldn't
be walkin' home in those shoes.

14:03.341 --> 14:04.476
Speaking of shoes...

14:06.376 --> 14:09.448
I came across a purse today that
matches 'em perfectly. You wanna see it?

14:17.822 --> 14:20.490
- Wanna go for a ride?
- You know, I should call the police

14:20.492 --> 14:22.357
and report your plates, dummy.

14:22.359 --> 14:24.228
Wanna come home
and meet my mother?

14:26.363 --> 14:29.934
She's making meatloaf,
and she does a really good job with it.

14:32.569 --> 14:34.870
- I'm Deuce.
- Yeah, I know that,

14:34.872 --> 14:37.472
because your partner
yelled it at you and everyone

14:37.474 --> 14:39.177
during the robbery
you committed today,

14:39.611 --> 14:40.545
Deuce.

14:41.078 --> 14:42.713
We gotta stop doing that.

14:44.649 --> 14:45.684
Seriously, though...

14:47.718 --> 14:49.588
my mother's meatloaf
is somethin' special.

14:51.555 --> 14:55.727
And if you miss out on it, you're gonna
be makin' a really, really big mistake.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.233
You're lucky I'm hungry...

15:03.702 --> 15:05.337
'cause I couldn't buy lunch.

15:11.675 --> 15:13.844
<i>And in all of my years
of public life,</i>

15:14.478 --> 15:16.747
<i>I have never
obstructed justice...</i>

15:17.015 --> 15:18.016
They don't think he knew.

15:18.916 --> 15:22.118
He knew.
He fuckin' knew everything.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.822
<i>...whether or not
their president is a crook.</i>

15:25.522 --> 15:28.390
- <i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>
- Who the hell is even runnin' the government?

15:28.392 --> 15:31.360
Hmm? Is crime even illegal?

15:31.362 --> 15:32.930
- I don't even wanna hear this.
- There you go.

15:33.798 --> 15:35.833
There's your law and order
candidate, Deloris.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.569
They're nothing
but hypocrites. Hmm?

15:39.436 --> 15:41.037
Robbin' their way to power,

15:41.039 --> 15:43.038
and then they wanna lock
everybody else up.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.642
You know, Tommy...

15:46.544 --> 15:49.014
that might just be...

15:50.515 --> 15:52.384
the smartest thing
you ever said.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.051
- You feelin' okay?
- Get out of here!

15:55.053 --> 15:58.756
- Come on!
- No, I want... Get out. Get out of here.

16:01.726 --> 16:02.493
There she is.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.564
- Ma. How are you?
- Ha ha! Hey.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.934
Ohh. Mm.

16:09.700 --> 16:10.635
Ma...

16:11.902 --> 16:13.436
this is Karyn.

16:13.438 --> 16:14.673
Karyn, this is Ma.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.606
That's the mayor over there,
my Aunt Connie.

16:17.608 --> 16:18.843
- Ha ha!
- Hi.

16:20.311 --> 16:24.348
- Hi. It's really nice to meet you.
- You, too, honey. Welcome.

16:25.116 --> 16:27.653
You look tired.
They workin' you too hard down there?

16:28.987 --> 16:32.690
- Long hours, Ma. Long hours, you know.
- And you two meet at work?

16:33.525 --> 16:35.961
Yeah, something like that.

16:39.997 --> 16:44.435
- Thank you.
- Well, help yourself. My home is your home.

16:45.069 --> 16:48.837
Deuce, make her a plate before
those animals get in here.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.773
I'm actually gonna go take her,

16:50.775 --> 16:53.142
introduce her to those animals
quick before we start eating.

16:53.144 --> 16:54.443
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

16:54.445 --> 16:55.644
- You ready?
- Yeah.

16:55.646 --> 16:57.949
Yeah, let's go meet the animals.

17:01.685 --> 17:02.751
- Ohh!
- Hey.

17:02.753 --> 17:06.087
Everyone. This is Dorothy.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.657
That's little Paulie.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.625
This bright ball of sunshine
is my sister Danielle.

17:10.627 --> 17:11.961
You don't need to bother
with her.

17:11.963 --> 17:13.528
That's Debbie.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.434
That's my degenerate
brother Tommy.

17:15.965 --> 17:18.002
That's Chucky.
You met him earlier.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.839
And I have no idea who this kid is.
Come on, let's sit down.

17:23.973 --> 17:26.645
<i>Let me point out,
it was voluntary on my part,</i>

17:27.044 --> 17:28.546
<i>and deliberately so,</i>

17:29.180 --> 17:31.416
<i>to avoid a precedent...</i>

17:33.584 --> 17:35.484
<i>...that might destroy the principle of
confidentiality for future presidents...</i>

17:35.486 --> 17:37.788
Turn that thing off! Come eat!

17:58.742 --> 18:01.243
- Doin' anything Friday night?
- I'm busy.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.578
- How about Saturday?
- Got plans.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.583
You know what?
This might change your mind.

18:06.818 --> 18:07.719
Yeah.

18:08.752 --> 18:09.754
I got you something.

18:11.289 --> 18:13.055
What are you doing? Get off me!
What are you doing?

18:13.057 --> 18:14.860
- This is for you.
- What is this?

18:19.664 --> 18:20.699
Chucky!

18:22.767 --> 18:24.970
- Where did you get this?
- Look at that.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.738
- Those are real diamonds in there.
- They are?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.274
Bet that sheep fucker from Milford
never got you something like that.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.778
Stop that!

18:33.578 --> 18:34.646
Chucky!

18:35.078 --> 18:36.447
Help me put it on,
will you?

18:36.848 --> 18:37.982
Oh, come on.

18:40.984 --> 18:43.152
<i>An unsolved
murder in Providence</i>

18:43.154 --> 18:46.958
<i>could have been ordered by Raymond
Patriarca from behind bars.</i>

18:47.959 --> 18:50.026
<i>And you said that your...
Your proof is...</i>

18:50.028 --> 18:51.430
Yeah, just a minute.

18:52.731 --> 18:53.563
- Where you gettin' all that cash?
- Here.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.467
- Okay.
- I love you.

18:55.966 --> 18:58.067
I love you, too.
Thank you.

18:58.069 --> 19:01.136
<i>...come to the attention of
the authorities long before...</i>

19:01.138 --> 19:02.040
Hey.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.885
- This is you?
- Yep, this is me.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.555
Is this a good place
to live?

19:19.257 --> 19:21.958
I guess I wish
you could see the stars

19:21.960 --> 19:23.495
when you looked up
at the sky.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.732
I'd like to just live somewhere
where you could see the stars.

19:28.866 --> 19:29.800
Yeah.

19:30.867 --> 19:31.970
I heard about that.

19:33.003 --> 19:34.138
Light pollution.

19:35.039 --> 19:36.040
Serious problem.

19:38.175 --> 19:40.811
- Wish me luck.
- Why should I do that?

19:42.879 --> 19:44.913
'Cause I got another thing
with Chucky next week.

19:44.915 --> 19:47.249
Okay, well,
you should try not to shoot anyone.

19:47.251 --> 19:51.287
You know what? No one was jumpy
until you said we were jumpy.

19:51.289 --> 19:52.891
It's whatever
you say it is.

19:53.323 --> 19:54.258
Oh, yeah?

19:55.393 --> 19:57.194
Well, here's what
I say it is.

19:59.030 --> 20:02.800
Maybe once this thing is done,
we both quit our shitty jobs,

20:03.867 --> 20:06.972
find a good place to live where
we can see some stars together.

20:07.371 --> 20:08.973
But this is
our first date.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.973
- So you admit it's a date.
- Oh, come on.

20:11.975 --> 20:13.712
You are really
something else.

20:14.745 --> 20:16.146
But I'm gonna keep
my job.

20:17.748 --> 20:20.085
I know for a fact that your boss
ain't gonna make payroll this week.

20:21.418 --> 20:24.386
Look, you know,
you should wear a mask or something.

20:24.388 --> 20:28.894
I mean, when you walked in there today,
I could see everything, your whole face.

21:04.228 --> 21:06.598
Maybe I'll pick you up again
tomorrow at work.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.202
Pick me up
at the bus stop.

21:37.028 --> 21:38.329
Hey, Deuce, you...

21:51.309 --> 21:54.112
Goddamn, everybody,
you are doing great!

21:55.078 --> 21:57.480
Hey, you keep your
goddamn eyes on the floor

21:57.482 --> 21:59.350
or I'll paint it
with your fucking skull!

22:00.050 --> 22:01.352
You understand me, sir?

22:03.555 --> 22:07.957
<i>All units advised to be on the
lookout for a dark 1970 Ford Thunderbird</i>

22:07.959 --> 22:10.095
<i>which may be attempting

22:10.427 --> 22:12.394
You look up at me again,
you find out what happens.

22:12.396 --> 22:14.799
Come on! Look at me again.

22:17.068 --> 22:20.070
- How we doin', partner?
- Right on time, partner.

22:21.105 --> 22:22.304
Hoo hoo ha ha ha!

22:22.306 --> 22:25.207
Six minutes to midnight,
my man.

22:25.209 --> 22:29.881
Get your hands over your head! I will waste
a motherfucker for fun! I swear to God!

<i>Unit 219 coming up on

22:34.851 --> 22:37.886
- God!
- <i>Roger, 372. I've got multiple units inbound.</i>

22:37.888 --> 22:40.157
I'm sorry, Deuce,
and I'm sorry, Chuck.

Pleasure doing business
with you.

22:50.568 --> 22:53.371
- Comin' through.
- Good day!

22:56.206 --> 22:59.240
Let's go, Tommy boy!
We're fuckin' legendary!

22:59.242 --> 23:01.509
Two in one, they said
it couldn't be done.

23:01.511 --> 23:03.181
Let's get the fuck
out of here!

23:05.282 --> 23:07.284
- Where's Tommy?
- Where the fuck is Tommy?

23:09.020 --> 23:11.252
We gotta go.
We gotta go now!

23:11.254 --> 23:13.157
Fuck me.
Get up there, drive!

23:56.967 --> 23:58.769
Hey, Bill, how you doin'?

24:02.440 --> 24:04.309
What do you think
they got the goat for?

24:05.576 --> 24:06.911
I don't know.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.414
It belongs to Joey Bruno.

24:10.580 --> 24:13.184
- You think he milks it?
- I think he fucks it.

24:14.585 --> 24:17.122
Germy bastards,
those Italians.

24:19.123 --> 24:22.360
You see the old geezer
over there, on the bench?

24:23.394 --> 24:25.797
That's <i>Il Padrino</i>
right there.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.033
That's Raymond.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.270
That's Raymond?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.876
That's the fucking guy I've
been hearing so much about?

24:41.044 --> 24:44.915
Guys I talk to says no one breaks a window
in Providence without Raymond's say-so.

24:46.416 --> 24:49.853
Whole town's crooked, so people talk
about him like he's the fuckin' mayor.

24:51.422 --> 24:53.521
Even the Five Families
in New York come to him

24:53.523 --> 24:56.226
when they need out-of-town
workers or to settle a dispute.

24:57.261 --> 25:00.964
Guy in the kitchen says Raymond's got
Whitey and them in Boston forever,

25:01.398 --> 25:04.968
after Joey Barboza
done 40 Irish all by himself.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.061
I heard some shit, too.

25:32.363 --> 25:33.932
Cat Angelo down in laundry

25:34.432 --> 25:36.934
swears he's the goddamn devil
walkin' the earth.

25:45.576 --> 25:48.880
Angelo said bodies been popping
up fuckin' everywhere for years.

25:51.615 --> 25:54.219
Anybody crosses Raymond
gets fuckin' buried.

25:57.221 --> 25:58.356
With brutality.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.357
No exceptions.

26:03.394 --> 26:05.262
<i>Il Padrone,</i> please.

26:08.499 --> 26:10.335
I ask for what I ask.

26:12.136 --> 26:14.004
Your son cost me a lot.

26:15.071 --> 26:16.573
Your family cost me a lot.

26:23.547 --> 26:26.214
Look, they seemed
like a nice family.

26:26.216 --> 26:28.886
They'd walk in and out of the
house, they'd always say "hello."

26:30.221 --> 26:32.257
He's the real power
in Rhode Island.

26:34.357 --> 26:36.059
Doesn't look like much.

26:37.694 --> 26:38.794
How come the guards don't make
him wear this prison shit?

26:38.796 --> 26:41.065
They can wear
whatever the fuck they want.

26:42.232 --> 26:43.699
I ain't scared of those pricks.

27:00.550 --> 27:02.319
Come on, you big guinea!

27:03.253 --> 27:04.155
Think I'm afraid of you?

27:05.356 --> 27:08.425
You ever been to Lowell,
you friggin' porchetta?

27:09.159 --> 27:10.127
You don't know
what that means!

27:12.495 --> 27:14.998
Hey. This was
fuckin' dumb, Chuck.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.133
What you talkin' about?
I got two packs of cigarettes

27:18.135 --> 27:19.801
says this fat fuck
can't catch me.

27:19.803 --> 27:21.171
Come on!

27:33.818 --> 27:36.186
Too much fuckin' tortellini!

28:22.665 --> 28:25.666
You're a fuckin' maniac.
You're a fuckin' maniac!

28:25.668 --> 28:28.605
Three times Golden Glove
champion, Lowell!

28:30.307 --> 28:33.444
Deuce?
Deuce, come on, get up!

28:34.677 --> 28:36.613
Let's go, let's go.

28:37.481 --> 28:38.683
On your feet.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.155
Gerry Ouimette
wants to see you.

28:45.723 --> 28:48.693
- Who the hell's Gerry Ouimette?
- Oh, shut the fuck up.

29:01.905 --> 29:05.076
Okay. First cell
on your right.

29:06.242 --> 29:07.712
That's the opposite
of your left.

29:21.658 --> 29:23.261
Hello, boys.

29:24.528 --> 29:25.663
Nice to meet you.

29:26.730 --> 29:28.066
Scotch okay?

29:28.432 --> 29:29.634
Yeah, thanks.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.838
Gerry Ouimette.
You can call me Gerry.

29:36.373 --> 29:38.440
This part of prison
is much nicer over here.

29:38.442 --> 29:39.740
Yeah, no shit.

29:42.146 --> 29:45.415
That was impressive
what you done out there today.

29:46.884 --> 29:50.952
Let me ask you somethin'. Is it true
that you two tried to hit two banks

29:50.954 --> 29:52.653
in the same city
on the same day?

29:52.655 --> 29:53.825
We sure did.

29:54.925 --> 29:56.490
I won't recommend
you try it.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.698
Yeah, mistakes happen.

30:01.298 --> 30:02.333
Ballsy.

30:04.801 --> 30:06.337
You're thinkin' big.

30:07.471 --> 30:09.107
That's good
for young guys.

30:10.374 --> 30:12.577
Yeah, we try and stay hip
up in Lowell.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.780
It's a smaller time thing than you
guys got going on down here, though.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.548
Yeah, well...

30:18.514 --> 30:20.582
I run with these Italians.

30:20.584 --> 30:22.320
Make 'em a lot of money.

30:23.419 --> 30:25.288
They appreciate my talent.

30:26.757 --> 30:28.493
Like I appreciate yours.

30:31.729 --> 30:35.364
So they put me in the nicest
part of their goddamn jail.

30:41.672 --> 30:44.142
I got certain agreements
with these Italians.

30:46.443 --> 30:50.945
- But lately, they've been getting so fuckin' greedy.
- Yeah.

30:50.947 --> 30:54.718
I always get the short end of the deal,
'cause I'm not Italian. I'm French.

30:57.655 --> 30:58.756
That's a shame.

31:00.523 --> 31:01.925
Yeah.

31:04.494 --> 31:05.829
I'm gonna need protection,

31:07.364 --> 31:10.367
but I'm gonna stand up to 'em
if they try and shake me down.

31:11.301 --> 31:14.938
What you done today to Jimmy the
Butcher, that's gonna count.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.276
You be my guys on the inside.

31:19.475 --> 31:22.812
Gerry Ouimette owes you
a favor in the world.

31:25.081 --> 31:26.550
Help you get on your feet.

31:28.685 --> 31:30.419
You understand the offer?

31:30.421 --> 31:32.590
- Yeah, we'll go back and talk about...
- No problem.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.662
Anyone got a fucking beef,

31:38.628 --> 31:40.697
you tell 'em come see
Chucky and Deuce.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.902
You make
a good decision quick.

31:45.969 --> 31:47.271
That's good.

31:52.675 --> 31:54.311
You're with the Frenchman now.

31:55.878 --> 31:59.750
Chuck, Deuce, you're gonna
be out in no time.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.751
Thanks.

32:20.636 --> 32:22.671
- Hi.
- Hey there, darlin'.

32:22.673 --> 32:23.907
Ha ha!

32:32.049 --> 32:33.451
You look skinny.

32:35.853 --> 32:37.588
I'm at my fighting
weight, baby.

32:39.322 --> 32:42.759
- Your ma's excited to see you.
- I'm excited to see your foxy ass.

32:55.438 --> 32:58.539
How's the family?
How's my sister?

32:58.541 --> 33:00.778
Her burn-out ex-husband
stopped sending money.

33:02.078 --> 33:04.315
He's the kinda guy
you just gotta stab.

33:04.848 --> 33:06.981
Okay, see, that's what
I'm talkin' about, Deuce.

33:06.983 --> 33:08.019
What?

33:09.119 --> 33:12.322
Can we unpack your bags?
Can we eat dinner?

33:13.089 --> 33:15.990
Yeah, let's eat dinner.

33:15.992 --> 33:16.926
No.

33:18.861 --> 33:21.529
Can we leave the parking
lot of the prison

33:21.531 --> 33:23.934
without you threatening
to stab somebody?

33:24.501 --> 33:26.034
I'm not saying me.

33:26.036 --> 33:28.806
I'm saying that somebody
should stab the fuckin' guy.

33:30.206 --> 33:33.944
<i>Then there was the airlift
of refugees from Southeast Asia.</i>

33:34.578 --> 33:37.913
<i>50,000 of them came out of
Saigon on MAC aircraft</i>

33:37.915 --> 33:40.384
<i>as the enemy closed in

<i>Another 70,000 escaped by sea,</i>

planes and our contract carriers...</i>

Who the hell drank
all the 'Gansetts?

33:55.566 --> 33:58.799
Oh, my goodness. Chucky.

33:58.801 --> 34:01.836
Oh, that's so sweet.
Mwah.

34:01.838 --> 34:03.006
I missed you.

34:08.145 --> 34:09.545
Welcome home, Deuce.

34:11.112 --> 34:12.514
Welcome home, Chucky.

34:14.885 --> 34:17.655
Yeah, listen,
let's go for a ride later.

34:18.522 --> 34:20.891
- Got a thing to show you.
- Yeah, all right.

34:25.127 --> 34:26.496
Hey, girls?

34:32.601 --> 34:34.804
Here, from the week.

34:36.806 --> 34:38.509
All right, Frank. Well...

34:38.908 --> 34:40.909
I don't even have
to open this, because...

34:41.978 --> 34:43.914
I could tell you
what's not in here.

34:44.781 --> 34:46.117
And that's 20 large.

34:46.850 --> 34:48.152
I'll shank him right now.

34:52.054 --> 34:53.556
It's all right.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.261
You know, Frank,
we've been friends a long time, right?

34:59.263 --> 35:02.400
Um... We grew up
together as kids.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.703
Your father knew my father.

35:07.771 --> 35:10.173
And sometimes I feel,
because of that,

35:10.841 --> 35:15.513
I'm here with these
four walls around me,

35:16.914 --> 35:20.214
and you're out there, and you feel that
maybe you could take advantage of me.

35:20.216 --> 35:22.852
- Raymond, listen to me...
- No, no, let me finish.

35:29.593 --> 35:31.495
Next time you bring me
an envelope,

35:33.296 --> 35:34.664
it better be right.

35:36.198 --> 35:38.001
Or next time you see me,

35:39.970 --> 35:41.105
you won't see me.

35:49.046 --> 35:50.481
<i>Et voilà.</i>

35:52.915 --> 35:55.917
What are you, Joe Namath?
You want a fuckin' fur coat?

35:55.919 --> 35:57.054
The fuck we doin' out here?

35:57.821 --> 35:59.023
This is Gerry's thing.

36:00.189 --> 36:01.724
That business card
he gave us.

36:02.258 --> 36:03.560
I called it
when I got out.

36:04.093 --> 36:05.929
This is it.
This is the job.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.798
Furs? That's what
the Frenchman's got for us?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.836
The Frenchman don't give
a fuck about the furs.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.205
That's the job.
Bonded Vault.

36:15.872 --> 36:18.975
- The fur place has a bonded vault?
- Forget the fucking furs.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.646
Everyone thinks
this is just a fur place.

36:23.379 --> 36:24.714
It isn't.

36:25.848 --> 36:27.147
These two Jew brothers,
the Levines,

36:27.149 --> 36:28.816
they own both companies.

36:28.818 --> 36:31.352
Hudson Furs
and Bonded Vault.

36:31.354 --> 36:33.890
Bonded Vault is a whole
other business.

36:34.357 --> 36:36.323
Only a select group
of people know that.

36:36.325 --> 36:38.628
Abe. Let's go.

36:45.868 --> 36:48.636
They got an actual
steel vault in there

36:48.638 --> 36:50.805
full of
safety deposit boxes.

36:50.807 --> 36:53.077
Big deposit boxes.

36:56.113 --> 37:00.917
They're used by a very
certain underworld clientele.

37:08.892 --> 37:10.594
Right here in Providence.

37:13.696 --> 37:16.300
Employees don't even know
what's back there.

37:17.934 --> 37:22.071
These boxes, there were things you
wouldn't wanna take to the bank.

37:31.682 --> 37:33.651
Who do you think uses
those deposit boxes?

37:36.019 --> 37:37.821
We're in fuckin' Providence!

37:39.423 --> 37:43.560
Look, Gerry might have a
fuckin' death wish, but I don't.

37:44.193 --> 37:45.228
You remember Raymond?

37:45.928 --> 37:47.597
Listen,
fuck that old man.

37:48.198 --> 37:50.568
This mob shit ain't
like it used to be.

37:51.935 --> 37:54.605
Raymond has been
locked up for years.

37:55.705 --> 37:56.973
No one's watching the store.

37:58.341 --> 37:59.774
Let's get the fuck out of
Providence, Chuck, all right?

37:59.776 --> 38:03.944
Tell Gerry, "Thanks, but no,
thanks" on this one. Let's go.

38:03.946 --> 38:06.247
Deucey, what is it
about Gerry Ouimette

38:06.249 --> 38:09.153
gave you the impression
that would be okay? Hmm?

38:10.153 --> 38:12.689
Just so we understand
each other here, Chuck,

38:14.423 --> 38:18.261
you're talking about robbing the
central bank of La Cosa Nostra.

38:20.330 --> 38:23.232
I'm talking about how
legends get made, Deuce.

38:25.135 --> 38:26.937
Raymond was
a young man once.

38:28.671 --> 38:31.207
I bet he had to shoot his fuckin'
shot to get to the money, too.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.614
Gerry's offering
70 stacks each.

38:40.050 --> 38:41.818
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:44.821 --> 38:46.857
This is
the retirement plan, pal.

38:47.990 --> 38:50.357
70,000? Each?

38:50.359 --> 38:52.328
I got him
to repeat it twice, too.

38:54.765 --> 38:55.866
He needs us.

38:58.001 --> 38:58.935
Plus...

39:00.370 --> 39:02.406
no one we hit can tell
the cops what we took.

39:05.809 --> 39:07.377
I ain't worried
about the cops.

39:13.783 --> 39:16.119
If there's as much shit in there
as you're sayin',

39:17.086 --> 39:19.889
- we're gonna need more guys than just us.
- Taken care of.

39:21.323 --> 39:23.394
Frenchie's got
the whole crew ready to go.

39:26.296 --> 39:27.562
What crew?

39:27.564 --> 39:29.096
All right, boys,

39:29.098 --> 39:30.330
the name of the game
is seven-card stud.

39:30.332 --> 39:31.466
Come on in, come on.

39:31.468 --> 39:33.037
Let me introduce you
around.

39:34.104 --> 39:36.571
Hey, everybody!
This is Buddy Lowell.

39:36.573 --> 39:39.006
Hey, how you doin', Buddy?

39:39.008 --> 39:42.544
I had this idea, right?
Remember when we hit that pawn shop

39:42.546 --> 39:44.881
and I accidentally yelled
your name when the gun went off?

39:45.548 --> 39:48.049
- Yeah, I remember that.
- I found a way to fix that.

39:48.051 --> 39:50.051
Gerry put all
these guys together,

39:50.053 --> 39:52.020
so nobody knows
anybody's real name.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.888
We keep it that way.
Everyone's just calling each other Buddy.

39:54.890 --> 39:57.193
Your name's Buddy,
plus the town you're from, dig?

39:58.060 --> 39:59.263
So you're Buddy Lowell.

40:00.463 --> 40:02.529
That sounds really
confusing, Chucky.

40:02.531 --> 40:05.966
Nah. Trust me,
you'll get used to it.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.705
Don't call me Chuck.
Call me Buddy Manchester.

40:12.542 --> 40:13.744
What are you doin'?

40:15.211 --> 40:17.245
You got no business being in this game.
What are you doin'?

40:17.247 --> 40:18.580
Buddy Providence.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.314
This here is my friend
Buddy Lowell.

40:20.316 --> 40:22.984
Hey, Buddy,
how's it going? Huh?

40:22.986 --> 40:25.053
We're gonna have a good time
with this thing, huh?

40:25.055 --> 40:26.890
Gonna make
a few fazools, right?

40:27.557 --> 40:30.225
It's your bet.
If I were you...

40:30.227 --> 40:31.761
Easily distracted?

40:32.361 --> 40:33.528
Buddy Cranston.

40:33.530 --> 40:35.332
Meet my partner
Buddy Lowell.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.899
- How youse doin'?
- Jesus Christ!

40:38.901 --> 40:40.037
He's fucking huge.

40:40.370 --> 40:41.405
Grow 'em big in Cranston.

40:43.973 --> 40:47.107
Hi there. I'm Skip...
Uh, Buddy. From Barrington.

40:47.109 --> 40:48.144
Buddy Barrington.

40:48.510 --> 40:49.445
Okay.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.316
Take a look at the board.

40:55.952 --> 40:59.120
- You're drawing dead, Buddy.
- That's Buddy Barrington.

40:59.122 --> 41:01.992
Cranston thinks he's a country
club hustler got in over his head.

41:02.425 --> 41:04.959
You think that's a good idea
to have him in the crew, Chuck?

41:04.961 --> 41:05.959
Buddy.

41:05.961 --> 41:07.497
- Huh?
- Huh?

41:08.564 --> 41:10.598
I meant... Not you.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.536
Here, I call you.

41:13.102 --> 41:14.269
Who's the old man, Chuck?

41:16.906 --> 41:17.971
That's Buddy Woonsocket.
I was just gonna tell you.

41:17.973 --> 41:19.173
We might have an issue
with him.

41:19.175 --> 41:22.944
Read 'em and weep,
you snail-eatin' motherfucker.

41:22.946 --> 41:23.680
Huh?

41:31.220 --> 41:32.121
Fixed!

41:34.024 --> 41:35.355
I will show you
how to use it.

41:35.357 --> 41:38.459
Ha! It's supposed to be
a friendly game.

41:38.461 --> 41:40.160
I told you
you had a crappy hand.

41:40.162 --> 41:41.529
- You fuck with me.
- Damn, man!

41:41.531 --> 41:43.363
- Just settle down, man!
- You fuck with me.

41:43.365 --> 41:45.902
- It's just a game.
- That's Buddy Roxbury.

41:46.435 --> 41:48.405
Him and Woonsocket
know each other somehow.

41:49.004 --> 41:51.939
Also, pretty sure
they're both mildly retarded.

41:51.941 --> 41:53.107
It's your deal.

41:53.109 --> 41:54.575
Back it up. Come on.

41:54.577 --> 41:57.113
Is this the best crew
Gerry can get?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.249
They're enough.

42:00.415 --> 42:02.049
Don't complain.
You still got some money left.

42:06.388 --> 42:09.827
Maybe we should do this ourselves
instead of with these guys.

42:10.593 --> 42:12.396
- And this whole Buddy thing...
- Hey, easy.

42:13.296 --> 42:15.232
You just relax, all right?

42:26.008 --> 42:27.109
Hey, you.

42:28.377 --> 42:29.979
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

42:31.481 --> 42:32.515
Danielle said you haven't been home.
Nobody has heard from you.

42:34.417 --> 42:37.054
- Just been busy.
- Yeah, I bet you have.

42:37.486 --> 42:39.088
How's things
with Gerry Ouimette?

42:40.689 --> 42:41.721
- You don't need to know that name.
- No, apparently I do,

42:41.723 --> 42:43.325
because you've been
out of jail a week

42:44.394 --> 42:47.761
and you're in Providence tryin' to get
yourself killed. You must be crazy.

42:47.763 --> 42:49.867
Listen to me.
We have no choice.

42:50.265 --> 42:52.501
If I can find out,
you don't think anyone else can?

42:56.705 --> 42:58.642
How many guys you got
on this job?

43:00.075 --> 43:02.111
Me, Chucky, plus five.

43:02.778 --> 43:04.146
You trust them?

43:05.214 --> 43:08.017
Yeah. Most of them
seem okay.

43:09.618 --> 43:11.321
One guy could be a problem.

43:13.522 --> 43:16.723
- Okay, you should make him the driver.
- Make him the driver.

43:16.725 --> 43:19.227
Yeah, convince him that's
the most important thing,

43:19.229 --> 43:22.529
and you need him to be responsible
for staying with the vehicle.

43:22.531 --> 43:24.501
Just keep him out of your way
during the job.

43:31.408 --> 43:33.107
Maybe I should
just hire you.

43:33.109 --> 43:35.646
Unfortunately,
I am not a damn fool.

43:36.646 --> 43:39.482
You keep following me around,
so you can't be too smart.

43:42.519 --> 43:44.053
How big is this thing?

43:46.823 --> 43:47.656
Really big.

43:50.093 --> 43:51.691
We can get out of here,
you know.

43:51.693 --> 43:54.562
You do not have to do this.
We still have time.

43:54.564 --> 43:55.632
You do not...

43:56.765 --> 44:00.002
- Baby, I don't need your mo...
- Just listen.

44:01.504 --> 44:02.706
Give it to my ma.

44:03.372 --> 44:04.473
You keep a hundred.

44:05.274 --> 44:07.077
I just gotta lay low
for a few weeks,

44:08.211 --> 44:09.578
and then I'll be in touch.

44:10.479 --> 44:12.415
There's nothing I can say?

44:15.517 --> 44:16.720
I should get goin'.

44:24.426 --> 44:25.662
Be safe, okay?

44:28.430 --> 44:29.999
Call me when you can.

44:56.792 --> 44:58.694
Come on. Say something.

45:04.234 --> 45:05.569
What do we have for vehicles?

45:09.839 --> 45:13.640
Barrington is gonna pick up the
second car in the alley over there.

45:13.642 --> 45:16.479
That's the pick-up.
Just pull right up front.

45:16.845 --> 45:19.881
Vault opens at 10:00 a.m.
We need to make sure Abraham's in,

45:19.883 --> 45:22.452
'cause he's the one who has
the combo to the safe.

45:22.919 --> 45:25.419
They usually have
two employees up front.

45:25.421 --> 45:28.357
The girl, Jeanie, is the receptionist,
but we're going right past her.

45:28.725 --> 45:33.361
When we walk in, right away
we are looking for Abraham.

45:33.363 --> 45:37.365
Myself and Buddy Lowell go in
first to lock down the situation.

45:37.367 --> 45:40.437
Nobody move!
I wanna talk to Abraham.

45:40.836 --> 45:44.205
A couple of minutes later,
Buddy Roxbury and Buddy Providence follow.

45:44.207 --> 45:48.178
Tape up the employees, crack the
vault, grab whatever's inside

45:48.845 --> 45:50.247
and we get the hell out.

45:50.747 --> 45:54.283
While we're in this van,
you're in charge.

45:55.285 --> 45:58.486
Till the Buddies come out with the
bags, what do you do?

45:58.488 --> 46:01.191
I wait, I watch.

46:01.691 --> 46:03.292
- I listen.
- That's right.

46:03.859 --> 46:07.664
You wait, you watch,
and you...

46:08.698 --> 46:10.865
I listen!

46:10.867 --> 46:13.466
Our main concern here
is making sure

46:13.468 --> 46:15.504
nobody walks in
when we're hitting the place.

46:15.905 --> 46:16.970
Or any customers.

46:16.972 --> 46:19.375
Oh! Who the fuck are you?

46:21.211 --> 46:22.709
Fuckin' pieces of shit.

46:22.711 --> 46:24.712
Look at these
two fuckin' assholes.

46:24.714 --> 46:27.150
So we go early. First thing.

46:28.251 --> 46:29.586
Buddy Barrington
watches the door.

46:30.919 --> 46:33.222
Police detail combs the block
around 10:00 a.m.

46:33.689 --> 46:36.525
So we need to be in
exactly 9:15 to be out by then.

46:37.227 --> 46:38.528
Settle down, all right?

46:39.261 --> 46:40.761
- Cool heads here.
- I got it.

46:40.763 --> 46:42.232
- Cool heads.
- Got it.

46:49.872 --> 46:50.841
How'd he do?

46:52.841 --> 46:53.742
Better.

46:56.511 --> 46:57.780
Is everybody clear?

46:58.914 --> 47:00.948
Do we need to talk
through it again?

47:00.950 --> 47:02.819
We don't need to talk
about nothin'.

47:03.852 --> 47:05.588
Let's crack this motherfucker.

48:01.910 --> 48:04.246
I'll see you
in 30 seconds.

48:08.383 --> 48:09.452
After you, sir.

48:11.586 --> 48:12.688
Thank you, sir.

48:33.575 --> 48:35.211
Excuse me, sir.
We're closed.

48:37.113 --> 48:38.546
Jerome Geller?

48:38.548 --> 48:41.048
Uh, Phil Defonte.

48:41.050 --> 48:42.651
Nickie Carducci.

48:44.220 --> 48:45.986
My friend Buddy asked me to come
in here and look at some accounts.

48:45.988 --> 48:47.988
Some boxes
I need access to.

48:47.990 --> 48:50.591
I don't even know
if I'm saying these names right.

48:50.593 --> 48:53.394
Let me take a look here.
Looks like a shopping list.

48:53.396 --> 48:55.029
Sir, we're closed right now.

48:55.031 --> 48:57.801
That's all right, Jeanie.
I can help him. Uh...

48:59.502 --> 49:02.505
These Italian names, you know?
They got so many vowels.

49:02.905 --> 49:05.408
Jesus, how do you...
how do you say that one?

49:06.475 --> 49:07.577
Hello, sir.

49:09.044 --> 49:10.946
Is that your van
in the parking lot?

49:14.417 --> 49:15.752
Don't think
about the alarm.

49:17.553 --> 49:18.588
If you touch it,

49:19.689 --> 49:21.491
I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' head off, okay?

49:22.591 --> 49:24.327
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

49:25.160 --> 49:27.796
You can't do this...
here.

49:28.564 --> 49:32.665
Do you know where you are?
You have come to the wrong place.

49:32.667 --> 49:34.570
You're telling that
to the wrong man.

49:35.571 --> 49:37.805
Now, where is your alarm?

49:42.111 --> 49:43.747
That's not a very good alarm.

49:45.381 --> 49:48.182
- How many other people you have in the office?
- Four, five.

49:48.184 --> 49:53.455
We've never really needed an
alarm to be protected... here.

49:54.756 --> 49:56.559
- We're friends of Raymond.
- Four?

49:56.959 --> 49:57.894
Or five?

50:00.530 --> 50:03.497
Five. Including me.

50:03.499 --> 50:07.937
Good. I want you
to call them up here right now.

50:08.905 --> 50:11.408
Every one of them. Right now!

50:15.544 --> 50:20.649
Sam, Hyman, Rosalind, everybody,
I need everyone in the showroom right now!

50:23.084 --> 50:24.086
Good.

50:29.158 --> 50:30.527
Now, keep movin'.

50:32.028 --> 50:33.997
Let's go.
You, too, sweetheart.

50:36.198 --> 50:37.800
Everything will be okay.

50:46.843 --> 50:48.712
Hello there.

50:50.011 --> 50:51.580
My name is Buddy.

50:52.214 --> 50:56.019
This man is my associate.
His name is also Buddy.

50:57.653 --> 51:00.022
Buddy and I
are here today...

51:02.258 --> 51:03.693
to rob you.

51:05.093 --> 51:07.429
So please put these pillowcases
on your pretty little heads,

51:10.232 --> 51:13.635
and this will all be over
relatively soon.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.738
Let's do what
we came here to do.

51:17.740 --> 51:18.908
- Go.
- Come on.

51:30.118 --> 51:31.488
Up against the wall.

51:32.655 --> 51:35.158
March! Up against the wall!
Let's go.

51:38.693 --> 51:39.828
Come on, doll.

51:56.812 --> 51:59.113
Thirty minutes.
Get a move on, Buddies.

51:59.115 --> 52:00.984
We got our shit
together, Buddy.

52:11.961 --> 52:14.627
We're good.
Everything's good.

52:38.653 --> 52:39.888
Buddy, look!

52:53.602 --> 52:55.003
How you doin' there,
sweetheart?

52:57.073 --> 52:59.305
- Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
- What?

52:59.307 --> 53:02.244
- What's your problem?
- My problem.

53:06.716 --> 53:08.718
Ain't gotta work no more!

53:13.923 --> 53:15.892
Yeah, baby! Keep it comin'.

53:26.836 --> 53:27.736
Buddy.

53:31.374 --> 53:32.575
Buddy?

53:33.709 --> 53:34.676
- Little busy here, Buddy.
- I want to take...

53:35.877 --> 53:37.377
- Buddy?
- ...the pillowcase off my head.

53:37.379 --> 53:42.752
- What?
- I want to take the pillowcase off my head.

53:43.352 --> 53:46.654
I can't.. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

53:46.656 --> 53:48.291
All right.

54:05.006 --> 54:07.707
- Sorry, gentlemen.
- Why? They open?

54:07.709 --> 54:09.778
Uh, a high-security client.

54:10.812 --> 54:13.749
- Come back in an hour, please.
- Are you fuckin' shitting me?

54:16.685 --> 54:19.722
Come on, this is fuckin'
bullshit is what it is. Jesus.

54:20.156 --> 54:23.323
That's all right. We'll get
somethin' to eat and come back later.

54:23.325 --> 54:26.426
- You're buyin'.
- Fuck you! I bought last time!

54:26.428 --> 54:30.566
What'd you throw for a fuckin' small
coffee, a buck, you cheap cocksucker?

54:32.834 --> 54:33.836
Let's go!

54:46.347 --> 54:47.749
We got 14 minutes.

55:54.350 --> 55:55.351
Here we go.

56:05.227 --> 56:06.896
It's so fuckin' hot in here.

56:23.111 --> 56:25.013
- Is that everything?
- Got it all, baby.

56:26.147 --> 56:27.749
All right.
Get in the van!

56:31.287 --> 56:32.388
Come on.

56:35.957 --> 56:38.325
All right, we're gonna
count to a hundred.

56:38.327 --> 56:39.462
Time's up, let's go.

57:54.403 --> 57:56.937
That's when he took out the pillowcases.
But initially...

57:56.939 --> 57:59.305
- What pillowcases?
- He had pillowcases for everyone.

57:59.307 --> 58:02.444
To put over our heads.
Initially, he came over here.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.336
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

58:34.676 --> 58:37.343
I'm with <i>The Providence
Journal,</i> and I'm wondering,

58:37.345 --> 58:40.080
did you have any valuables
inside Hudson Furs?

58:40.082 --> 58:42.015
We're looking to speak with
customers of the establishment.

58:42.017 --> 58:42.885
Huh?

58:43.885 --> 58:45.685
Were you a customer
of Hudson Furs?

58:45.687 --> 58:47.189
Am I a customer?

58:48.022 --> 58:50.357
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm a customer.

58:50.359 --> 58:53.192
Okay, great.
Can I please have your name?

58:53.194 --> 58:54.727
Yeah, Benjamin.

58:54.729 --> 58:57.566
Benjamin.
And your last name, please?

58:59.001 --> 58:59.935
Benjamin.

59:03.272 --> 59:06.008
Your name
is Benjamin Benjamin?

59:08.077 --> 59:10.243
If you don't mind me asking,
Mr. Benjamin,

59:10.245 --> 59:12.415
what were you storing
inside the vault?

59:13.615 --> 59:15.749
My coin collection.

59:15.751 --> 59:19.118
And I had a coin collection
in there, too.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.522
And I wanna know
what the fuck is goin' on.

59:22.524 --> 59:25.058
I heard 'em say everything's
on the floor in there!

59:25.060 --> 59:27.196
How they gonna know
whose shit is whose?

59:27.696 --> 59:31.133
So, you're all
coin collectors?

59:32.600 --> 59:35.301
Sorry. Can I get
your name, please?

59:35.303 --> 59:38.104
Yeah, we're all
coin collectors!

59:38.106 --> 59:41.607
It's a fuckin' convention,
you fuckin' Irish freckled fuck!

59:41.609 --> 59:43.243
You motherfucker!

01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:15.944
Get going there, buds.

01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:36.999
Hey!

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:39.501
Ha!

01:00:44.305 --> 01:00:46.506
Come on, Sox,
here we go!

01:00:46.508 --> 01:00:48.477
- Sox, let's go.
- Come on!

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.484
<i>Retired once
on a bouncing ball to center.</i>

01:00:57.486 --> 01:00:59.419
What have we got here?
What's happening?

01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:02.522
- What's goin' on?
- <i>Pitcher deals, and here's a ball.</i>

01:01:02.524 --> 01:01:06.225
It makes me happy to see
Chucky let loose a little bit.

01:01:07.763 --> 01:01:10.464
<i>There it goes, a long drive.</i>

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:13.265
They both bet ten grand
on the Sox.

01:01:13.267 --> 01:01:15.769
<i>A home run!
The Red Sox win it!</i>

01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:17.740
When Chucky told me,
I could've killed him.

01:01:18.439 --> 01:01:20.406
Well, whatever
gets them off, I guess.

01:01:22.443 --> 01:01:24.446
Yes!

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:27.546
It's nice to see Chucky
less stressed, though,

01:01:27.548 --> 01:01:30.452
especially since we heard
about Roxbury.

01:01:30.852 --> 01:01:32.555
What? What happened
in Roxbury?

01:01:33.287 --> 01:01:34.622
Deuce didn't tell me
anything.

01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:36.691
The guy from the job.

01:01:40.162 --> 01:01:41.727
They called him Buddy Roxbury.

01:01:41.729 --> 01:01:44.163
No one's seen or heard from him
in two weeks.

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:47.303
And he's still owed 40 grand
from the fence.

01:01:47.803 --> 01:01:51.138
I don't know about you,
but it sounds kinda fishy.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.140
Oh, you brought the money,
though, right?

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:56.412
I got the money,
but if the shit looks stepped on,

01:01:57.245 --> 01:01:58.646
I'm out, you dig?

01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:04.285
Hey, how you doin', Tony?

01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:06.155
How's it goin', fellas?

01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:09.392
Got us a little
somethin' to eat.

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:13.595
Here you go.
Sausage and pepper for the big man.

01:02:14.662 --> 01:02:16.328
Peppers and eggs
for me.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.702
And for you, I got
a nice big stromboli.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.544
Clean this up. Throw him
in the wood chipper.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:37.819
I didn't mean to make you nervous.
Everything's fine.

01:02:39.687 --> 01:02:42.457
- You look real pretty, by the way.
- Thank you.

01:02:43.492 --> 01:02:45.694
Cheers for Carlton Fisk,
I guess, right?

01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:49.098
I'll deal with him myself.

01:02:50.198 --> 01:02:52.635
For now, give Danielle 300.

01:02:53.401 --> 01:02:54.801
There she is.

01:02:54.803 --> 01:02:56.806
- Come here.
- Come here? You come here.

01:02:58.673 --> 01:03:01.941
- Look, I gotta go to bed.
- Oh, no, no, no. You gotta stay a little while,

01:03:01.943 --> 01:03:05.245
because it's Edie and Chucky's last
night before they go back east.

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:08.250
Come on, Karyn.
We're gonna miss you!

01:03:08.883 --> 01:03:10.783
How about we all
just do one more?

01:03:10.785 --> 01:03:13.688
- One more.
- One fuckin' more.

01:03:14.823 --> 01:03:16.192
One more.

01:03:16.925 --> 01:03:18.861
This is to Carlton
fuckin' Fisk!

01:03:19.827 --> 01:03:21.796
To Carlton fuckin' Fisk!

01:03:26.301 --> 01:03:28.567
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

01:03:44.852 --> 01:03:45.820
Oh.

01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:47.783
When do you think
we can go home?

01:04:49.084 --> 01:04:50.286
I don't know.

01:04:51.386 --> 01:04:52.787
I'm not gettin' done
like Roxbury.

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:56.691
You oughta slow down.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:03.731
Don't be mad at me, baby.

01:05:04.732 --> 01:05:06.765
You know I hate it
when you're mad at me.

01:05:06.767 --> 01:05:08.336
You're gettin' messy
out here.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.307
And I don't wanna have to
keep moving around like this.

01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:13.809
I'm serious.

01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:16.946
I'm sorry.

01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:20.783
Hey.

01:05:22.883 --> 01:05:23.885
I love you.

01:05:25.854 --> 01:05:26.789
Hey.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.828
I really do.

01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:45.274
I love you.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.513
I ain't never said that
to a woman before.

01:05:52.914 --> 01:05:54.515
That's something special,
you know?

01:05:55.383 --> 01:05:56.885
Well, I'm somethin' special.

01:05:58.019 --> 01:05:59.685
You owe me your life.

01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:04.459
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:06.026 --> 01:06:08.563
I told you to make that old man
the getaway driver.

01:06:11.466 --> 01:06:15.602
Because of me, you are here.
I am your everything.

01:06:17.705 --> 01:06:19.738
There's that
fuckin' mouth of yours.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.610
Or is tonight the night it gets
me in trouble with the wrong guy?

01:06:26.013 --> 01:06:26.981
Maybe.

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:33.521
Baby.

01:06:35.656 --> 01:06:37.026
Look at the stars.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:43.832
You got us those.

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:48.971
And I love you.

01:06:55.176 --> 01:06:56.979
Look at the stars.

01:07:24.872 --> 01:07:27.906
Deuce.
There's a car in the parking lot.

01:07:27.908 --> 01:07:28.977
Deuce?

01:07:30.845 --> 01:07:31.944
Deuce?

01:07:31.946 --> 01:07:32.914
What?

01:07:34.015 --> 01:07:34.982
There's a car
in the parking lot.

01:07:38.953 --> 01:07:40.356
What does it look like?

01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:42.855
You told me to tell you if
there's another car out there,

01:07:42.857 --> 01:07:44.560
and there's another car
out there.

01:07:48.696 --> 01:07:50.131
What's it fuckin' look like?

01:08:00.742 --> 01:08:03.144
Put that fuckin' back.
Let go of it.

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:12.051
Fuck.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.801
- Hello?
- <i>How's it goin', buddy?</i>

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:37.104
Not bad.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:40.609
How's it goin' with you?

01:09:41.943 --> 01:09:44.010
You know, uh,
looking back and forth

01:09:44.011 --> 01:09:47.249
between a shitty motel
parking lot and the TV.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:50.219
Just gettin' a little
agitated out here.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.055
Listen to me.

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:57.156
Some of those guys
were never cut out for this.

01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:59.261
We said that
the night we met 'em.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.694
So he's pointing
a salad fork at me...

01:10:02.696 --> 01:10:04.266
Cranston said
he was a gambler.

01:10:08.168 --> 01:10:09.203
Oh, my God!

01:10:15.944 --> 01:10:19.214
Gamblers owe debts. Gerry don't
think it has nothin' to do with us.

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:21.517
I fuckin' hope not, Chuck.

01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:29.221
I'm startin' to see
some characters around me.

01:10:29.223 --> 01:10:31.126
Well, you're on
that shit, Deucey.

01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:33.896
I bet you're seein'
all kinds of things.

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:39.298
- Be cool.
- Is there a problem with the fucking fence, Chuck?

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.235
Gerry owes me some money,
you know?

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:43.835
<i>There's no problem.</i>

01:10:43.837 --> 01:10:45.873
Just taking a little longer
than we thought.

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:51.647
This, uh, Barrington thing's
got the Frenchman laying low.

01:10:52.146 --> 01:10:55.117
That ain't got shit to do with
me, Chuck, respectfully.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:57.886
We were promised
what we was promised.

01:11:00.989 --> 01:11:03.792
- Call me next week.
- <i>I'm sorry, Chuck.</i>

01:11:04.993 --> 01:11:06.727
I'm sorry. I...

01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:13.569
Karyn's driving me
fuckin' nuts.

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:17.673
<i>She's gettin' antsy.
I don't know.</i>

01:11:18.806 --> 01:11:19.774
No problem.

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:23.745
- You sit tight, call me next week.
- <i>Chuck.</i>

01:11:26.114 --> 01:11:27.380
Give Ma my best, huh?

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:36.725
Fuck.

01:11:42.763 --> 01:11:43.899
Fuck.

01:12:09.089 --> 01:12:10.025
Karyn?

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:33.411
- It should be!
- Yeah. We're gonna see the Statue of Liberty.

01:12:33.413 --> 01:12:35.214
We're going to see
the White House.

01:12:35.216 --> 01:12:37.349
I got a long way to go,
statue.

01:12:40.788 --> 01:12:42.822
- Get back to your room.
- What, Deuce?

01:12:42.824 --> 01:12:45.457
- Right now, get back to your room.
- Hey, man, what are you doin'?

01:12:45.459 --> 01:12:48.227
- Mind your business, fuck face!
- What are you fuckin' doin'?

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:50.897
- Deuce! Come on, get the gun out of his...
- That's right.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.198
Will you let go of me!

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.202
What is wrong with you?
What's your problem?

01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:59.071
What's my problem? What's your problem?
You out of your fuckin' mind?

01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:01.107
- What the fuck?
- What do you think "stay here" means?

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.345
- Get the fuck in there.
- Just get the fuck off of me!

01:13:04.145 --> 01:13:05.379
Fuck you, Deuce!

01:13:49.289 --> 01:13:52.591
<i>Some people
have a deep, abiding respect</i>

01:13:52.593 --> 01:13:55.931
<i>for the natural beauty
that was once this country.</i>

01:13:57.565 --> 01:13:59.201
<i>And some people don't.</i>

01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:04.871
<i>People start pollution.
People can stop it.</i>

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.318
Who is it?

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.489
Your mother!

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:37.839
- Hey, Chuck.
- You look like shit.

01:14:40.007 --> 01:14:41.242
Whiskey and women.

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:48.816
Karyn around?

01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:56.792
No. No, uh...

01:14:59.026 --> 01:15:00.261
she left a week ago.

01:15:01.695 --> 01:15:03.097
Everything got all...

01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:06.200
fucked up out here
between us, you know?

01:15:13.106 --> 01:15:14.042
Come on.

01:15:15.142 --> 01:15:17.311
Put some pants on.
Let's go for a ride.

01:15:25.285 --> 01:15:27.987
You still seeing
that Edie girl? The teacher?

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:31.393
Yeah, I still see her.
I also started seein' her sister.

01:15:32.994 --> 01:15:36.031
Funnily enough, her sister's been
the one who's been gettin' all...

01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:37.865
possessive.

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:44.239
- Deuce.
- Tell me I'm wrong.

01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:47.309
Tell me that ain't why
they sent you out here.

01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:50.576
You ain't supposed to be
out here for another month.

01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:54.580
All of a sudden, you call me out of nowhere
and you say you gotta see me right away.

01:15:54.582 --> 01:15:57.319
Tell me I'm fuckin' wrong.
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:15:57.685 --> 01:15:58.887
Tell me I'm wrong!

01:15:59.686 --> 01:16:00.988
Okay, listen to me.

01:16:02.123 --> 01:16:04.359
You been makin'
a lot of noise out here.

01:16:05.493 --> 01:16:06.394
People hear things.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:10.429
Are you here to kill me
or not, Chuck?

01:16:10.431 --> 01:16:14.502
A newspaper in Providence been reportin'
you're willing to testify for 10,000.

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.972
That doesn't even make
any fucking sense!

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:19.607
Show me the gun.

01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:22.476
Show me the gun!

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.927
After all we've
been through, Chuck?

01:16:41.495 --> 01:16:43.464
You're the one
that dragged me into this.

01:16:45.098 --> 01:16:48.300
If you didn't fight Jimmy the Butcher,
none of this would've happened.

01:16:48.302 --> 01:16:50.171
Do you ever think
about that?

01:16:53.473 --> 01:16:56.944
And you're gonna come down here,
and you're gonna kill me

01:16:57.544 --> 01:17:00.179
and leave me like a fuckin' rat
in the desert to die?

01:17:00.181 --> 01:17:01.283
Easy, now.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:07.621
Let's just fuckin'...
think for a minute here.

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.327
After everything
we been through, Chucky Flynn.

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:17.464
My brother, huh?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.636
I don't wanna
fucking kill you, Chuck.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.540
I mean, Jesus Christ,
I don't wanna die,

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.611
but I don't wanna
fuckin' kill you, either.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:31.680
Fuck.

01:17:34.382 --> 01:17:37.385
I don't wanna kill you, either, Deucey.
Jesus Christ.

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.656
I'm sorry.

01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:49.361
I mean, I was supposed
to kill you,

01:17:49.363 --> 01:17:51.566
but I couldn't kill you, Deucey.
I love you.

01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:54.034
How about...

01:17:55.636 --> 01:17:57.105
Well, how about, um...

01:17:58.472 --> 01:17:59.740
How about fuck 'em, then?

01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:02.744
How about fuck 'em?

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:04.980
You don't do it then.

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:09.751
You don't do it.
You don't kill me, and I don't kill you.

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.771
Jesus, stop fuckin' crying on
yourself, you germy bastard.

01:18:32.172 --> 01:18:33.607
You've been fuckin' cryin'.

01:18:38.445 --> 01:18:40.247
Don't make
a fuckin' big deal.

01:18:43.484 --> 01:18:44.718
Jesus Christ.

01:18:47.587 --> 01:18:49.323
What are we supposed
to do now?

01:18:50.357 --> 01:18:52.060
We're supposed to hug
or somethin'?

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.227
Go fuck yourself.

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:01.035
Roxbury.

01:19:01.569 --> 01:19:02.570
Barrington.

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.304
I told you...

01:19:08.309 --> 01:19:09.577
Got Woonsocket, too.

01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:30.065
You don't see
what this is, Chuck?

01:19:31.565 --> 01:19:33.532
Huh? They're doin' us
one by one.

01:19:33.534 --> 01:19:35.270
Meanwhile nobody's
gettin' paid out.

01:19:36.337 --> 01:19:39.107
Gerry keeps sayin'
it's too hot to move the shit.

01:19:39.873 --> 01:19:42.543
It's bullshit is what it is.
Think about it!

01:19:43.276 --> 01:19:47.580
Right? They promised us
70k apiece for seven guys,

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:49.417
but we didn't fuckin' see
any of that,

01:19:49.883 --> 01:19:51.718
except for what we skimmed
when we were in there.

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:55.453
No. I heard on a news report
the other day

01:19:55.455 --> 01:19:59.360
that we took out an estimated four
million dollars from that job.

01:20:00.727 --> 01:20:02.864
Who's got the money,
Chuck? Huh?

01:20:04.832 --> 01:20:07.435
We brought it to Gerry,
who was supposed to bring it to the fence.

01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:09.838
And Gerry's keeping it

01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:13.371
to get back at those
fuckin' greasy Italians.

01:20:13.373 --> 01:20:16.310
Meanwhile, we're strung up here
like fuckin' bait for Raymond.

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:20.280
No. No.
You gotta talk to Gerry.

01:20:22.016 --> 01:20:26.421
You talk to Gerry, or we move on
him, if that's what it takes.

01:20:29.356 --> 01:20:30.290
All right.

01:20:31.891 --> 01:20:33.794
I'll talk to Gerry
one last time.

01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:37.231
If that don't work,
you're right.

01:20:38.298 --> 01:20:39.501
We'll do it your way.

01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:42.504
- I'll make a move on it.
- Yeah.

01:20:47.908 --> 01:20:48.843
Hey.

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:52.480
Let me fix this.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.555
'Cause if not,
I'm fucking killin' him.

01:21:05.559 --> 01:21:09.460
We did our part, Gerry. Okay?
We did our part,

01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:11.764
and now you're sittin' on the
payoff while we're out here naked.

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:15.703
<i>In the meantime,
bodies popping up on the news.</i>

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.707
It's startin' to feel a lot
like old times in Providence.

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.512
We gotta get paid and get out.

01:21:53.473 --> 01:21:54.409
Hey.

01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:56.875
Hey.

01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:00.847
You look nice.

01:22:11.891 --> 01:22:14.995
They sent Chucky Flynn
down here to kill me.

01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:19.900
My best friend
since I was 15 years old.

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:28.676
It's over, Deuce.

01:22:29.677 --> 01:22:30.612
It sure is.

01:22:34.047 --> 01:22:38.885
I don't know why things got all
fucked up out here between us.

01:22:41.388 --> 01:22:42.856
I feel like I'm goin' crazy.

01:22:45.525 --> 01:22:47.628
Where the fuck you been?
Where'd you go?

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:51.399
I made a mistake.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.568
Gettin' away with it,
that... that...

01:22:57.570 --> 01:23:00.037
that was the worst thing
that ever happened to us.

01:23:00.039 --> 01:23:03.142
- We should've never got away with that.
- Calm down, calm down.

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.945
Lower your voice. Please.

01:23:05.879 --> 01:23:09.449
All that money was evil,
and it poisoned us.

01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.919
It poisoned us the same way it did
them, all those Italians.

01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:15.289
It's bloody money,
you know.

01:23:15.955 --> 01:23:18.157
I sold all that jewelry
that you gave me.

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:21.660
I couldn't stand thinking about
whose wife or mother it came from

01:23:21.662 --> 01:23:24.865
or who had to get hurt
or die for me to have it.

01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:27.568
It destroys people.

01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:32.839
That's why everyone
keeps turning up dead.

01:23:34.141 --> 01:23:36.077
And you're gonna
turn up dead, too, Deuce.

01:23:41.981 --> 01:23:42.949
Yeah.

01:23:52.126 --> 01:23:55.027
Here's the last drop
of your poisoned money.

01:23:56.997 --> 01:23:59.965
There's a plane ticket
in there and $300.

01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:01.736
Go home, Karyn.

01:24:03.736 --> 01:24:05.707
I'm sorry
it's over, Deuce.

01:24:07.074 --> 01:24:09.541
I'm so sorry it's over.

01:24:09.543 --> 01:24:12.810
Stop saying that it's over,
okay? I'm saying to you...

01:24:12.812 --> 01:24:15.147
...take this and go home.

01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:16.948
Deuce, you gotta listen
to them, okay?

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:18.884
You just listen
to whatever they say.

01:24:18.886 --> 01:24:20.952
- What's wrong with you?
- You gotta take the deal.

01:24:20.954 --> 01:24:22.689
You gotta just listen
to them, okay?

01:24:24.324 --> 01:24:25.924
Just try... Just listen to
what they have to say, please.

01:24:25.926 --> 01:24:28.960
- Listen to who?
- That's the only way it's gonna work out.

01:24:28.962 --> 01:24:31.596
Okay, baby?
You just gotta listen to them, Deuce.

01:24:31.598 --> 01:24:33.834
- Just listen to them.
- Robert Dussault?

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.736
You're under arrest
for suspicion of armed robbery.

01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:39.374
I'm so sorry.

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:45.710
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:24:45.712 --> 01:24:46.847
I'm sorry.

01:24:48.214 --> 01:24:50.048
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.716
- Deuce.
- ...we will provide one.

01:24:55.955 --> 01:24:58.825
Do you understand these
rights that I've read to you?

01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:00.595
Yeah.

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:40.168
You're gonna tell me everything
you know about the Bonded Vault heist.

01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:43.734
And that's the only way you're gonna
get out of this mess alive, Deuce.

01:25:43.736 --> 01:25:44.939
Trust me on that one.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.941
There's a lot of angry
guineas in this town.

01:25:49.376 --> 01:25:51.276
Word around the campfire
is that the price on your head

01:25:51.278 --> 01:25:52.680
is at an all-time high.

01:25:53.113 --> 01:25:54.548
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

01:25:55.248 --> 01:25:56.184
Go ahead.

01:25:57.584 --> 01:26:00.053
Chucky Flynn's guy's available,
now that he's down a client.

01:26:04.223 --> 01:26:05.626
You didn't know that, Deuce?

01:26:10.597 --> 01:26:13.665
- What?
- Yesterday morning, they pulled him out of the river.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.736
- In what was it, Centerdale?
- Yeah.

01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:18.205
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

01:26:19.306 --> 01:26:21.142
He disobeyed a direct order.

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:24.544
There's no second chances with
these guys you're dealing with.

01:26:26.046 --> 01:26:28.249
Chucky took that bullet
for you.

01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:32.153
But I'd bet you my last dollar
there's another one right behind it.

01:26:32.852 --> 01:26:35.021
And probably one
for your girl Karyn as well.

01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:43.931
They got $10,000
on your fucking head.

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:45.967
Nationwide.

01:26:49.302 --> 01:26:53.205
Lucky for you, you're a candidate
for the Witness Protection Program,

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:55.209
if you've got a story to tell.

01:27:25.405 --> 01:27:27.240
If Chucky's dead,
it doesn't matter.

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:31.579
What do you wanna know?

01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:52.132
Chucky and I met
when I was 15.

01:27:52.699 --> 01:27:53.633
Uh...

01:27:55.401 --> 01:27:57.070
been fuckin'
thick as thieves since.

01:27:59.105 --> 01:28:00.707
Chucky and I
were in ACI.

01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:05.844
He got in some fuckin' fight,
and people got impressed by it.

01:28:05.846 --> 01:28:09.081
This guy Gerry Ouimette
called us down to his cell,

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:12.587
and, you know,
things fuckin' happened.

01:28:14.821 --> 01:28:17.091
To be honest, we didn't really
know what we were gettin' into.

01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:20.925
We were going to this bonded
vault which was behind a furrier.

01:28:20.927 --> 01:28:23.129
And, uh, we went in.

01:28:23.896 --> 01:28:26.766
And we had a team with us,
bunch of guys.

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:30.935
The others
went by Buddy Roxbury,

01:28:30.937 --> 01:28:32.073
Buddy Cranston.

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.273
It was some fuckin' thing
he came up with.

01:28:36.275 --> 01:28:38.845
We loaded up as many bags
as possible.

01:28:40.279 --> 01:28:41.715
Everybody carried them out.

01:28:42.181 --> 01:28:43.917
And then after
everything got on...

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.185
we just left
like nothing happened.

01:28:48.187 --> 01:28:50.156
Heard about it
on the news a lot.

01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:55.696
And then I knew that maybe this
was a bigger deal than I thought.

01:28:58.998 --> 01:29:01.167
Chucky had a fuckin'
great time, too. Heh.

01:29:03.302 --> 01:29:06.140
Never got paid, and people
started disappearing.

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.878
And that's how I knew that it probably
was the worst thing we ever did.

01:29:12.378 --> 01:29:14.147
The Bonded Vault robbery

01:29:15.214 --> 01:29:17.017
was coordinated by myself

01:29:19.386 --> 01:29:20.721
and Chucky Flynn.

01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:27.828
And the job was contracted
by Gerry Ouimette.

01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:47.681
Chucky?

01:29:49.348 --> 01:29:50.685
You're alive?

01:29:52.452 --> 01:29:53.820
Sit down, Deuce.

01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:19.970
I'm a diabetic and I got
a bad memory, you know.

01:31:19.972 --> 01:31:22.407
But if you want me to
come back after my trial,

01:31:22.409 --> 01:31:25.146
I'll be glad to tell America
what's really going on.

01:31:25.979 --> 01:31:28.947
No, no, they asked me to talk,
so I'm gonna talk.

01:31:28.949 --> 01:31:30.918
I mean,
let's all be honest here.

01:31:31.517 --> 01:31:34.152
You could make a pretty good
movie about my life, too,

01:31:34.154 --> 01:31:36.121
all things you made up
about me.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:39.390
My name has been dragged through
the mud for the past 30 years

01:31:39.392 --> 01:31:41.427
under the myth
of organized crime.

01:31:42.529 --> 01:31:44.131
And you want to know why?

01:31:45.498 --> 01:31:48.234
Because I'm a successful
Italian-American businessman.

01:31:49.535 --> 01:31:51.070
That's my only crime here.

01:31:52.704 --> 01:31:56.309
You people act like Italians brought
all the crime on the boat with us.

01:31:57.977 --> 01:31:59.879
But you're a smart man,
Senator,

01:32:00.379 --> 01:32:01.848
and you ought to know

01:32:02.548 --> 01:32:05.185
America is
a criminal enterprise.

01:32:06.386 --> 01:32:08.152
It's been that way
when we got here,

01:32:08.154 --> 01:32:10.190
it'll be that way
when I'm dead and buried.

01:32:11.992 --> 01:32:13.427
So do what you gotta do.

01:33:17.089 --> 01:33:18.926
This shit
is out of hand, Gerry.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.462
We came through on our end.

01:33:23.029 --> 01:33:24.363
You don't understand a fuckin'
thing, do you, Chucky Flynn?

01:33:26.699 --> 01:33:30.167
Why don't you make me understand
now, Gerry? Come on, please.

01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:32.105
Please, make me understand.

01:33:33.406 --> 01:33:35.275
I get 70,000, too.

01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:38.913
I'm still waiting on my end,
just like you.

01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:47.954
You were the one
who gave us the job, Gerry.

01:33:49.522 --> 01:33:51.124
If you ain't got the money,

01:33:52.191 --> 01:33:54.627
who the fuck we been working for
this whole time?

01:33:58.431 --> 01:33:59.999
I already told you,
Chucky.

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:04.570
In Providence,
there's only one man you can work for.

01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:11.444
Heh. Gerry, Gerry, come on.
Don't look so sad.

01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:15.015
A man can still
make his luck in America.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:20.254
But it's not like
it used to be. Nah.

01:34:21.354 --> 01:34:24.091
This thing of ours, it's over.

01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:26.993
But no one will admit it.

01:34:29.262 --> 01:34:31.031
I want what's mine.

01:34:33.232 --> 01:34:35.101
I want all of it.

01:34:39.729 --> 01:34:44.729
