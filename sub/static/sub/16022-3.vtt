Stokes:
<i>Some creatures are</i>
<i>more fortunate than humans are.</i>

00:07.608 --> 00:10.409
<i>Pheromones do</i>

00:10.411 --> 00:13.612
<i>Keep the mob moving</i>
<i>in an orderly fashion,</i>

00:13.614 --> 00:16.448
<i>Even when panic sets in.</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:19.284
<i>We humans have no such gift.</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:21.754
(screaming, shouting)

00:21.756 --> 00:25.624
<i>It's every man for himself.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:29.495
(screaming, coughing)

00:32.632 --> 00:35.034
Concert going on.

00:35.036 --> 00:38.037
Fire sent 'em all
running for the door.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.371
Just a kid.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.607
Any more bodies?

00:41.609 --> 00:43.809
Yeah, there's
three more inside.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.811
At least
the last thing

00:45.813 --> 00:48.347
He saw was a beautiful night.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.483
Through the smoke,
mob stomping all over him.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.354
Nice thought.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.423
Woman: Let me through!
Russell:
No, hey, don't...

00:57.425 --> 00:58.757
Don't let her...
Someone h... Some help

00:58.759 --> 00:59.825
My boy!

00:59.827 --> 01:02.094
He said he was
meeting friends and

01:02.096 --> 01:03.562
Hearing some music.
I said I'd be here

01:03.564 --> 01:05.297
At midnight to pick him up.
Where are his friends?

01:05.299 --> 01:06.465
Where are his friends?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.734
Who did this?
Who did this to kevin?!

01:08.736 --> 01:10.636
Who did this to my son?

01:10.638 --> 01:12.604
(sobs)
who did this to my boy?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.339
Stokes:
She's looking for answers.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.409
But it's nobody's fault
they were trying to survive.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.412
Human instinct.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.449
<i>Fire starts</i>
<i>and everything you need--</i>

01:23.451 --> 01:25.317
<i>Breath, space, life--</i>

01:25.319 --> 01:27.319
Is on the other side of a door.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.755
Doesn't matter what's
in front of you.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.257
Even if it's your best friend.

01:35.395 --> 01:38.130
Let's get at it, boss.

(water dripping)

02:26.446 --> 02:28.380
Stokes: All right, russell
checked in with brass

02:28.382 --> 02:29.882
And witnesses at the hospital.

02:29.884 --> 02:33.385
Finn, why don't you and I start
on this fire investigation.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.853
Okay.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.588
Yeah, we'll document
the victims.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.657
Sure.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.461
(distant siren wailing)

02:48.668 --> 02:50.669
Kevin ellis. He's 18.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.437
He's a local.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.672
Brody:
No burns.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.440
But a lot of soot.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.576
And multiple blunt-force trauma
to the face,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.578
The head...

02:59.580 --> 03:00.913
And the hands.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.182
Awful.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.750
I never
liked concerts.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.785
Just give me an ipod,
some headphones,

03:06.787 --> 03:09.321
A little personal space
and I'm good.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.757
Brody: Not me. The right
crowd, the right band.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.794
Closest thing I've ever come
to a religious experience.

03:21.634 --> 03:22.701
Dave.
Yeah?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.703
You mind if I pull his wallet?

03:24.705 --> 03:25.804
Yeah, go ahead.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.680
Timo padia. 19.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.616
No burns on him either.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.619
Looks like he took a hit
to the nose.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.889
There's petechiae in his eyes.

03:43.891 --> 03:44.890
He was asphyxiated.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.226
By the crowd? It doesn't...

03:47.228 --> 03:48.560
Look like
he was trampled.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.895
Blood down his shirt says

03:49.897 --> 03:53.365
He was upright
when his nose was broken.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.601
No shoeprints on him.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.402
Crush asphyxiation

03:57.404 --> 03:58.470
Can happen
when you're on your feet.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.406
<i>Pressure from other bodies</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:03.342
<i>Prevents the lungs</i>
<i>from expanding,</i>

04:03.344 --> 04:05.777
<i>Making it impossible</i>
<i>to breathe.</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:08.680
However the physics worked,

04:08.682 --> 04:10.849
This kid went through hell.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.621
(indistinct chatter)
(monitor beeping)

04:23.730 --> 04:26.398
Russell:
Hey. Jim.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.401
Well... Hell
of a thing, huh?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.669
It's the kind of news

04:30.671 --> 04:33.405
That stops a parent's heart.
We got a dozen

04:33.407 --> 04:35.540
Serious injuries,
half of them critical.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.610
Along with, uh,
three unidentified.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.746
Including that guy.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.750
So, the club owner, he's sitting
over there in the black shirt.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.485
His name is stu kirchoff.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.887
He was bunkered in to his back
office when the fire broke out.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.689
Can't even remember
the name of the band.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.924
That's a little odd.
Well,

04:52.926 --> 04:54.793
The place is kind of
like amateur hour, you know?

04:54.795 --> 04:59.531
And listen to some random band
rage onstage.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.999
Any witness videos, photos?

05:01.001 --> 05:03.335
Anything to help us reconstruct?

05:03.337 --> 05:04.770
No. Not yet. Nothing.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.639
My kids use
their cell phone cameras

05:07.641 --> 05:09.875
Like they're all-seeing eyes.
Maybe they think

05:09.877 --> 05:12.611
It's not too cool to share
their photos with cops.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.014
Finlay: You know, I have to
admit, when I, uh,

05:16.016 --> 05:18.016
Worked in seattle,

05:18.018 --> 05:20.886
I didn't get a chance to do
many fire investigations.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.754
It's complicated.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.756
Really? Even for you?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.359
Someone who can paint
a whole knife fight

05:27.361 --> 05:29.494
From a few drops of blood?

05:29.496 --> 05:30.962
I think you'll be all right.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.531
All right. Where do we start?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.833
Our main goal is to find
the point of origin.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.703
And a fire burns up
and out, right?

05:37.705 --> 05:40.906
So if we locate
the lowest point of damage,

05:40.908 --> 05:43.442
That should tell us
where the fire started.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.711
But...

05:45.713 --> 05:47.813
What?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.916
You see all this...
Soundproof foam

05:50.918 --> 05:53.618
Right here?
Yeah.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.986
All this caught fire

05:54.988 --> 05:58.457
And just rained down
all over the place.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.624
Creating

05:59.626 --> 06:01.760
Many low points.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.664
I bet it went up so fast
that's what caused the stampede.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.368
Sidle:
Think this was the stage.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.903
Didn't want to leave
his axe behind.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.140
No wallet, no I.D.
On either of them.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.710
Just a few guitar picks

06:18.712 --> 06:20.579
On this one.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.913
I'm guessing...

06:21.915 --> 06:24.916
That makes her the bassist.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.486
Reddish skin tone suggests

06:27.488 --> 06:28.720
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.389
Smoke inhalation.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.758
Firefighters knocked in
the side door.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.728
How come these two didn't exit
through it?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.797
Maybe the smoke was too thick,
it was too dark

06:38.799 --> 06:39.831
And they couldn't see.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.466
Carbon monoxide poisoning

06:41.468 --> 06:42.834
Also disorients

06:42.836 --> 06:44.936
And confuses long
before it kills.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.939
Band on the run may have been
all turned around.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.008
♪

07:13.766 --> 07:15.967
(beeping)

07:31.784 --> 07:34.519
You realize that this
was bound to happen.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.688
You covered the walls
with polyurethane foam.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.858
Went up like gasoline.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.861
No sprinklers,
no smoke alarms,

07:42.863 --> 07:44.229
Empty fire extinguishers

07:44.231 --> 07:45.864
And only one exit.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.732
That's not true.
There's a...

07:47.734 --> 07:49.701
Second one by
the stage.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.236
Which couldn't be opened.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.739
Evidence shows
that this victim

07:54.741 --> 07:56.875
Tried to kick that door open.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.044
I sure as hell didn't lock it.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.645
Oh, I used to,

08:00.647 --> 08:01.780
To keep people
from sneaking in

08:01.782 --> 08:04.983
During the shows, but, uh...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.618
(sighs)

08:08.121 --> 08:13.625
Sanders:
Well, we were hoping that you
might be able to help with that.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.927
They were in the band
that was playing.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.532
All right, there-there was a guy
that, uh...

08:20.534 --> 08:22.934
Was the lead vocals,
played the guitar.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.736
Another guy on the drums.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.505
And the gal on bass.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.908
That's all you know?
Look,

08:29.910 --> 08:30.909
These groups, they come to me,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.844
Ask to play, I let 'em.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.713
But the music...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.882
...Got lost on me years ago.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.885
Nevertheless,
kids would line up,

08:39.887 --> 08:43.088
Pay ten bucks,
come in, let loose.

08:43.090 --> 08:46.157
That's just the way
it's been for...

08:46.159 --> 08:48.760
30 years now at that club.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.162
Well, speaking
of club history,

08:51.164 --> 08:54.232
My colleagues found
some recent online photos

08:54.234 --> 08:56.902
Of the lockjaw club's
interior,

08:56.904 --> 08:59.004
To aid with reconstruction.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.273
Noticed something missing.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.875
Must've been
a pretty sweet guitar

09:03.877 --> 09:05.176
To get that kind of treatment.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.178
You know who gave me
that guitar?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.914
Stevie ray vaughan.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.950
Yeah, he did a spot
for me back in '85.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.819
Blew the roof and the doors
right off of the joint.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.021
So why wasn't it

09:16.023 --> 09:17.656
There tonight?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.257
Oh.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.861
About a month or so ago,

09:22.863 --> 09:26.765
I... I pawned it.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.671
I had to keep the power on
somehow.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.807
Yeah, if it wasn't
for that cash, uh...

09:35.809 --> 09:38.777
Club would've been closed
tonight.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.865
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:00.867 --> 10:04.603
And without a stack
of old <i>national geographics,</i>

10:04.605 --> 10:05.971
Like a proper doctor.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.940
David's still prepping
the last victim,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.875
But here's what we have so far.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.245
Kevin ellis. C.O.D.'s
intracerebral hemorrhage

10:14.247 --> 10:16.615
Due to multiple
blunt force trauma.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.883
Steel-toed boots
may be the punk style,

10:18.885 --> 10:21.319
But they definitely
clashed with his skull.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.255
Tox showed he had a very high
blood alcohol level.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.625
Could've made him lose balance
in the stampede.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.961
Did you also get a panel
on our john doe musician?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.162
Yep.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.031
This discoloration

10:33.033 --> 10:34.966
Certainly suggests
carbon monoxide.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.802
Brody:
Along with a toxic chaser.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.270
Hydrogen cyanide.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.207
Same stuff used
in execution chambers.

10:42.209 --> 10:46.344
By the burning polyurethane foam
on the walls.

10:46.346 --> 10:50.215
Well, on this
three-act bill...

10:50.217 --> 10:53.885
The last c.O.D.'s
the real surprise.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.022
Timo padia,
ligature strangulation.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.289
Choked by a chain.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.092
I, uh,
used your I.R. Camera,

11:01.094 --> 11:02.227
Saw the pattern.

11:02.229 --> 11:06.031
So... He was murdered.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.232
Before the fire?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.100
I didn't find any soot
in his lungs.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.036
But I did find this.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.104
Some sort of
granular material

11:13.106 --> 11:14.806
Lodged in his trachea.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.175
(clattering)

11:17.177 --> 11:19.811
Sorry.
Is something wrong,
david?

11:19.813 --> 11:23.915
It's just that female decedent
that I'm prepping...

11:23.917 --> 11:25.216
Jane doe bassist?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.853
You guys really need
to see this.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.103
Wow.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.938
There are even more
under the sheet.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.106
Brody:
An hispanic kid

11:48.108 --> 11:49.941
Is strangled to death
with a chain

11:49.943 --> 11:53.011
While a racist rocks out
onstage?

11:53.013 --> 11:55.146
What the hell kind
of show was this?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.849
(beeping)

12:25.811 --> 12:27.045
(beeping)

12:34.787 --> 12:36.855
(punk music playing)

12:59.445 --> 13:02.981
Our female victim's
name is rene nylen. 21.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.115
Local. She was a bassist

13:04.117 --> 13:05.950
In a hatecore band
called white rising.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.819
"hatecore."

13:07.821 --> 13:09.420
Music for white supremacists,
right?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.790
Yeah. Underground scene
with a national presence.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.991
Lots of anthems for

13:12.993 --> 13:15.026
Angry young bigots. Here...

13:15.028 --> 13:17.095
Is some video from
a recent white rising show.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.563
(punk music playing)

13:18.565 --> 13:20.965
I couldn't
find the names

13:20.967 --> 13:22.433
Of the other band members,
but I'm guessing

13:22.435 --> 13:25.970
That the masked front man
is our john doe musician.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.239
And I'm guessing that's why
our club owner was so forgetful

13:28.241 --> 13:29.974
About the band he'd booked.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.810
Admit to letting these guys
take the stage,

13:31.812 --> 13:38.183
But what was timo padia doing
at a white power "hatenanny"?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.318
Maybe someone asked
that same question.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.887
Then did something about it,
killed him.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.824
Yeah, and someone adds fire
to the fury.

13:51.564 --> 13:55.166
All right. Thanks.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.102
Brass spoke to one
of the hospitalized witnesses.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.437
Evidently, they saw timo padia
enter the club

13:59.439 --> 14:02.307
With a blonde girl.
They were holding hands.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.975
He was a little drunk
and flirty.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.178
But once timo heard the music,
he sobered up quick.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.247
And where's this girl now?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.248
She hasn't come forward.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.382
All right.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.450
So maybe...

14:12.452 --> 14:14.319
One of these hatecore fans,

14:14.321 --> 14:15.620
Pumped up on the music,

14:15.622 --> 14:17.121
Goes after padia,

14:17.123 --> 14:18.289
Kills him

14:18.291 --> 14:19.524
And starts the fire
to cover it up.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.526
I just got a
text from hodges.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.095
He said the trace they found
in timo padia's throat

14:24.097 --> 14:27.065
Is actually
crushed limestone.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.399
Which I'm guessing
he swallowed somehow

14:28.401 --> 14:30.335
While he was being choked.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.136
I didn't find any material
like that at the body.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.372
But, you know what,
it's worth a look around.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.575
Maybe we can find exactly
where padia was attacked.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.391
Fire didn't touch
this storeroom.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.266
Morgan.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.003
Blood drops. Gravitational.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.373
Brody:
Got more blood here.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.642
Double-line pattern.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.077
That's odd.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.418
Look, there were scratches
on timo padia's boots.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.524
Timo padia was killed in here.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.259
(choking)

15:30.396 --> 15:31.696
Sidle:
<i>Dragged out.</i>

15:31.698 --> 15:33.665
<i>And then dumped</i>
<i>on the dance floor.</i>

15:33.667 --> 15:36.567
And then the killer
set fire to the place.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.304
One crime leads to another.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.306
(siren chirping)

15:41.308 --> 15:43.308
(helicopter flying over)

15:43.310 --> 15:45.543
Hey, could you give me
a hand with this?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.545
(clanging)

15:47.547 --> 15:49.147
What is it?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.049
(grunts)
I want to check
out this door.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.021
Yep. The door was not locked.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.723
Then why couldn't the band
get out of it?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.326
Exactly.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.429
Fresh paint scrapings
embedded on the outside.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.031
Something was
blocking that door.
Yep.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.267
Heard nick stokes and a friend
were making a mess of my scene.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.103
Ryan. Miller.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.171
Fire investigator.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.505
Finn. Hey.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.341
So, uh...

16:16.343 --> 16:21.446
Uh, we're still looking
for the point of origin.
Yeah?

16:21.448 --> 16:24.582
Yeah. Ryan, why don't you, uh,
come over here? Check this out.

16:26.452 --> 16:30.455
Uh, I think this is
what received the most damage.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.590
Hey, stokes,
I'll tell you what, man.
What's that?

16:32.592 --> 16:36.060
I don't mind you invading
my scene when you bring
a partner who looks like that.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.161
What do you mean?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.129
You know.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.635
Ah, here you go.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.038
Look at this, man. Hey, uh,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.639
Finn, want to come
take a look at this?

16:48.641 --> 16:52.510
See, these springs
are annealed.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.678
Finlay:
Annealed?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.380
Yeah, a certain threshold
of heat,

16:55.382 --> 16:57.181
Springs lose their tension
and they, uh,

16:57.183 --> 16:58.649
Collapse like this.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.386
But you only hit that threshold

17:01.388 --> 17:03.021
If you add an extra combustible.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.124
Like what?
Gasoline, sterno, butane.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.393
Whatever the arsonist's
particular appetite calls for.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.029
Finlay: So you're assuming
that it's arson?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.031
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.366
Someone doused this bench,
lit it up.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.202
Well, then you should
get me a shot of that.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.371
(chuckling):
No, bro.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.640
Let me get my real camera
from the truck.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.108
Digital's got no soul.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.743
(chuckles)

17:26.512 --> 17:28.379
He's kind of obnoxious.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.314
He's also very old-school.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.483
He's been taught
by old-school guys.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.619
When it comes to
a fire investigation,

17:34.621 --> 17:37.155
Some of those pages have been
ripped out of the book.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.657
A lot of things have been
disproved-- case in point,

17:39.659 --> 17:41.325
Annealed springs simply

17:41.327 --> 17:43.494
Indicate that the springs...

17:43.496 --> 17:46.697
He likes to jump to conclusions.
Ryan:
Oh, chief,

17:46.699 --> 17:49.167
You got
your hydrocarbon detector?
Yeah.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.802
I tell you what.
I'll trade with you.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.336
There you go.
Give this thing a try.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.572
Thanks, man. All right,
this is gonna tell us

17:54.574 --> 17:57.408
Which type of accelerant
the arsonist used.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.411
(quiet electronic crackling)

18:05.217 --> 18:07.318
(sensor beeping rapidly)

18:07.320 --> 18:09.620
Hit. Five-foot radius.
All right.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.560
(stokes coughs)

18:16.628 --> 18:19.564
Hello, sweetheart.

18:19.566 --> 18:23.501
Piece of cardboard
with a candle attached.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.702
Let me see that.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.842
Incendiary device.

18:30.844 --> 18:34.579
We found a few things
in your son's pockets.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.781
Wallet and keys.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.524
Kevin's grandpa gave him this
when he... (sniffles)

18:46.526 --> 18:48.893
For his eighth birthday.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.733
I hope you find peace,
mrs. Ellis.

18:56.668 --> 19:00.538
This officer's gonna
show you to your car.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.149
(sighs)
brass:
Does she have any idea

19:11.151 --> 19:14.252
What kind of band
her son was going to see?

19:14.254 --> 19:17.855
What kind of racist, violent
crowd he was hanging out with?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.691
I don't think so, no.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.593
Maybe that's good.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.297
So, this band white rising--
they made a kind of top 40.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.465
They made the fbi

19:27.467 --> 19:29.167
Hate group watch-list.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.434
The local office
tossed me their file.

19:30.436 --> 19:34.639
I.D. On our masked singer--
kurt harper.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.174
Definitely played
the club before.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.643
They only left one body
behind last time.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.212
Three months ago,
white rising played

19:41.214 --> 19:42.813
A gig at the lockjaw club.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.882
Now, outside the club,
in an adjacent parking lot,

19:44.884 --> 19:46.918
A group of asian-american kids
were skateboarding.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.686
So, the show let out

19:48.688 --> 19:51.455
And some of the
skinhead thugs let loose

19:51.457 --> 19:53.824
And beat one of the
skateboarders into a coma.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.661
Lee wong jr., 17 years old.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.795
Assailants got away?

19:57.797 --> 19:58.729
Yeah, they blended
right back

19:58.731 --> 20:00.665
Into the all-white crowd.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.733
So, the feds took
a picture of kurt harper

20:02.735 --> 20:03.801
And showed it
to the vic's friends,

20:03.803 --> 20:07.772
But none of them could
identify him as an attacker.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.474
No, he's just the guy
who got the attackers

20:10.476 --> 20:12.843
Amped up and
ready for blood.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.313
Well, to the question
of whether the stiff

20:15.315 --> 20:17.281
That's lying horizontal
in our morgue

20:17.283 --> 20:19.817
Is kurt harper,
permanently silenced,

20:19.819 --> 20:21.619
The feds did
a dental comparison.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.987
And it's a match.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.223
Okay, well,
that settles that.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.693
Front man and the bass
player are both dead.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.861
The drummer vanished.

20:30.863 --> 20:34.765
Whether or not the band had
any particular enemies?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.767
Nick found an
incendiary device,

20:36.769 --> 20:37.835
So we're looking at arson.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.371
No specific grudges, no.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.973
Okay.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.841
When you fling enough crap
into the universe,

20:43.843 --> 20:45.643
Occasionally the breeze
is going to blow your way.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.516
Trace you scraped from the
outside of the club doors--

20:52.518 --> 20:53.851
Stock pontiac red paint.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.354
Used since the early '90s.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.855
So, there was a red pontiac
blocking the door?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.825
Well, there wasn't one
on the scene when we arrived.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.027
Okay, how are you doing
with the incendiary device?

21:03.029 --> 21:06.297
Gcms revealed traces
of gasoline on the cardboard.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.266
Confirms arson.
Yeah, and since
I'm full-service,

21:08.268 --> 21:09.467
I didn't stop with the gas.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.002
I noticed this barcode.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.670
<i>Ran it.</i>

21:12.672 --> 21:14.272
Cardboard's from a box
of auto parts

21:14.274 --> 21:15.973
Delivered to a local mechanic--

21:15.975 --> 21:17.742
Lee wong automotive.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.578
That can't be a
coincidence.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.546
What do you mean?
Brass worked a case

21:22.548 --> 21:25.049
A few months ago, where this
kid was beaten half to death,

21:25.051 --> 21:26.584
Put in a coma.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.953
His name was lee wong, jr.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.921
Sounds like more than arson.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.024
Yeah, it sounds like revenge.

21:36.762 --> 21:40.564
Thank you for coming down, nora.
I appreciate it.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.700
This article
about the assault

21:42.702 --> 21:44.835
On your brother--
you were pretty vocal.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.705
Lee couldn't speak for himself.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.040
Still can't.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.676
Might never.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.344
Yeah, I heard that.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.479
I'm... Very sorry.

21:55.481 --> 21:59.350
Fact that his assailants
were never identified--

21:59.352 --> 22:02.787
Boy that... That must have
been frustrating.

22:04.089 --> 22:07.091
What kind of car
do you drive, nora?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.660
Jeep.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.095
My dad's. He passed away.

22:11.097 --> 22:14.598
But you-you do run the
family auto shop, right?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.400
So, you'd probably
get your hands

22:16.402 --> 22:18.769
On any kind of car
you wanted, like a...

22:18.771 --> 22:20.571
Red pontiac, maybe?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.340
I drive a jeep.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.709
What does this have to do
with my brother's beating?

22:24.711 --> 22:28.112
Well, the band that inspired
your brother's beating returned

22:28.114 --> 22:30.715
To that same club last night,
but then, you know that,

22:30.717 --> 22:33.884
Don't you, because
you were there?

22:33.886 --> 22:35.986
Took a candle,

22:35.988 --> 22:38.489
Scrap of cardboard
from your shop,

22:38.491 --> 22:42.093
You doused it in some gasoline,
and you set the club on fire.

22:42.095 --> 22:45.730
And you killed
three people, nora.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.766
I thought I was here to learn
who ruined my brother's life.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.769
Instead,
you're accusing me of...

22:55.674 --> 22:58.008
You're wrong.

22:58.010 --> 23:01.946
Two days after the attack
of my brother,

23:01.948 --> 23:05.483
I brought some friends
to the place where it happened.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.919
I made sky lanterns.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.690
Cardboard, candle,
paper balloon.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.993
We lit them and watched them
float up,

23:15.995 --> 23:18.562
Thinking of lee.

23:20.699 --> 23:23.634
One or two landed
on the roof of that club.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.703
Maybe there was gas
on the cardboard

23:25.705 --> 23:27.705
From the floor of the shop.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.106
But that was months ago.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.942
They didn't start
a fire then,

23:31.944 --> 23:34.745
Or last night.

23:37.048 --> 23:41.819
Looks like the grieving
sister's story makes sense.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.721
Yeah, that sky lantern

23:43.723 --> 23:45.423
Landed on the roof,

23:45.425 --> 23:46.624
Stays up there
a couple months,

23:46.626 --> 23:47.691
Then comes down in here

23:47.693 --> 23:49.193
When that part
of the roof collapsed.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.195
And we still have
no point of origin,

23:51.197 --> 23:53.664
Which means
we are nowhere.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.699
Okay, there's a, uh...

23:55.701 --> 23:57.134
A new technique
that I learned recently

23:57.136 --> 23:59.437
When it comes to fire
that I'd like to try out here.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.638
Are you up for it?

24:00.640 --> 24:05.843
Now, during a fire, the
insulation around the wiring

24:05.845 --> 24:06.777
In the walls melts away.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.779
<i>Once that happens,</i>

24:08.781 --> 24:12.616
<i>The bare wires then</i>
<i>short-circuit or arc,</i>

24:12.618 --> 24:15.186
<i>Leaving behind</i>
<i>these distinct little beads</i>

24:15.188 --> 24:16.754
<i>At each point of an arc.</i>

24:16.756 --> 24:19.857
Now, no power can flow
through that arc,

24:19.859 --> 24:23.160
So if you map out
the arc locations,

24:23.162 --> 24:25.930
And compare it against
the building's circuitry,

24:25.932 --> 24:28.899
You should be able to figure out
which wire burnt first.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.534
And hopefully,
where the fire started.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.735
Exactly.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.903
Where do we start?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.205
Well, we start

24:34.207 --> 24:37.641
By checking the wiring
in the walls for arcs.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.781
Did you forget where the point
of origin was, stokes?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.082
You know, I could have, uh...

24:45.084 --> 24:46.884
Could've written it on
a post-it note for you.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.619
Actually, that theory
has been disproven,

24:48.621 --> 24:50.721
So, we're still investigating.

24:50.723 --> 24:51.856
Looks more like
you're remodeling.
Stokes:
No.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.657
No, actually, we are
still investigating.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.792
We were thinking about

24:54.794 --> 24:56.160
Just arc-mapping
the whole building.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.629
No. No, bro, not arc-mapping.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.264
I'm not trying to make
you look bad, chief.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.100
You guys are going
about this all wrong.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.602
Leave...
Finlay:
You know what?

25:04.604 --> 25:07.872
We're gonna continue working.

25:07.874 --> 25:11.675
So, you're just gonna do
this on your own, huh?

25:11.677 --> 25:13.844
That's what we're gonna do.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.614
Okay. Let's see
how that works out for you.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.649
Have fun.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.884
Thanks, chief.

25:19.886 --> 25:24.054
♪

25:54.753 --> 25:57.888
(electrical buzzing)

26:02.661 --> 26:08.032
Here's where the fire started,
making this arc number one.

26:08.034 --> 26:08.866
Good.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.301
Hey, guys.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.069
How's it going?
Finlay:
Good.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.771
We just found
the point of origin.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.008
Did he call you?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.944
Wanted to get us in
trouble with the sheriff?

26:19.946 --> 26:22.246
Oh... Miller's a good guy.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.014
Smart investigator. I mean,

26:24.016 --> 26:25.282
Yeah, he had a few concerns.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.151
Well, we had a few concerns
about him.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.752
Nick obviously

26:28.754 --> 26:30.220
Knows his science.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.056
That guy was all about his ego.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.725
I tried to be fair
with him, conrad.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.594
Four people dead,
a dozen more burnt all over.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.028
I don't give a damn
about fair, nick.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.898
We deduced that the fire had
to have started

26:40.900 --> 26:42.733
In this corner.
I think

26:42.735 --> 26:45.002
All we need to do now
is dig through this rubble

26:45.004 --> 26:46.270
And see what we can find.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.972
All right, all right, okay.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.040
What are we waiting for?
Let's do it.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.946
You tracked it down?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.781
The red pontiac of doom.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.217
Had to have been at the
club during the fire,

27:00.219 --> 27:01.919
But gone when the
fire department arrived.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.787
It's a tight time-frame.
Not much traffic.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.658
There you go-- the only
red pontiac around,

27:07.660 --> 27:08.759
Headed away from the venue.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.861
Paint looks charred
from the heat.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.997
Can't make out
the driver's face, though.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.832
Dmv any help
with the plate?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.135
Driver is a northtown resident

27:18.137 --> 27:20.671
Named jeremy douglass.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.841
Haven't seen my car in, like...

27:23.843 --> 27:26.710
24 hours.

27:28.847 --> 27:29.913
That's not me driving.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.751
Told us that you were at
that skinhead show last night.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.853
This is your car,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.755
Driving away from it.
What are you saying?

27:37.757 --> 27:39.857
That one of your friendly
aryan brothers swiped it?

27:39.859 --> 27:43.394
Saying, whatever my-my car

27:43.396 --> 27:45.396
Might have been...

27:45.398 --> 27:48.732
Involved in...

27:48.734 --> 27:50.701
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.404
So, uh,

27:53.406 --> 27:54.805
What... What, uh...
What-what...

27:54.807 --> 27:56.206
What might it have been
involved in?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.008
Sanders: It was parked in
an alley, blocking

27:58.010 --> 27:59.743
The exit door from the club,

27:59.745 --> 28:01.745
Trapping the club-goers inside
during the fire.

28:01.747 --> 28:02.913
Four of them died.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.715
Sidle:
Something

28:04.717 --> 28:06.283
About that coming back to you?

28:13.024 --> 28:15.325
He asked me to borrow it.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.960
My car.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.862
Texted me, in the middle
of the concert.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.233
"leave your car in the alley,
keys in it.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.768
Right now. Walk away."

28:24.770 --> 28:26.904
Who's caleb voigt?

28:26.906 --> 28:28.706
A guy.

28:28.708 --> 28:32.810
Well, he's-he's not the kind
of guy you say no to.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.044
Dude's like half pit-bull,

28:34.046 --> 28:36.980
And-and... And breaks rocks
for a living.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.782
Breaks rocks?

28:38.784 --> 28:40.951
What, like... Limestone?

28:40.953 --> 28:43.120
Sure, I guess.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.955
Why?
Because he left

28:44.957 --> 28:47.424
Some of it on the kid
he choked to death at the club.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.094
A murder for which you
provided the getaway car.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.796
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, it-it
wasn't like that. I didn't know.

28:52.798 --> 28:55.966
But this caleb guy
took out one person.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.136
You took out three people
with your stupid parking job.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.923
Found something.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.794
Cigarette

29:23.796 --> 29:26.797
And matches,
rubber-banded together.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.198
Whoa.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.967
Hey, conrad,

29:29.969 --> 29:31.435
How much you want
to bet, the arsonist

29:31.437 --> 29:33.837
Didn't expect that
to survive the fire?

29:33.839 --> 29:35.806
How much you want to bet they
didn't expect a couple of csis

29:35.808 --> 29:37.808
To rip the walls
down to find it?

29:37.810 --> 29:39.843
Nice work, guys.

29:39.845 --> 29:40.978
Mr. Douglass,

29:40.980 --> 29:42.479
I'm sheriff ecklie.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.014
We're gonna
give you a chance

29:44.016 --> 29:46.383
To do yourself a
ten-to-15 year favor.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.424
<i>Looks no different</i>
<i>than a cell phone, so, you do</i>

29:54.426 --> 29:56.460
Your job right,
caleb voigt

29:56.462 --> 29:58.929
Doesn't know any different,
and you come out

29:58.931 --> 30:01.265
In one piece.

30:08.873 --> 30:11.175
Car's out back.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.110
Key's in it.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.411
Cool.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.947
What's voigt working on?

30:16.949 --> 30:19.950
Looks like he's cleaning
some equipment with acid.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.152
Sanders:
<i>We need to get caleb voigt</i>

30:22.154 --> 30:24.588
To connect himself
to our evidence.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.591
That could be the
limestone debris.

30:27.593 --> 30:31.195
How-how, uh... How-how...
How's work been?

30:33.865 --> 30:35.399
What the hell do you care?

30:35.401 --> 30:37.267
Just-just like, uh,

30:37.269 --> 30:39.303
What-what kind of jobs
you been doing?

30:39.305 --> 30:41.905
What-what-what kind of materials
you working with?

30:41.907 --> 30:44.174
Don't hit me up for work,
all right?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.943
You couldn't handle it.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.945
Sanders:
<i>Or...</i>

30:47.947 --> 30:49.479
We connect him
to the murder weapon.

30:49.481 --> 30:53.016
A chain, approximately
a half-inch wide.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.018
Caleb wears a chain like that
on his wallet.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.620
Sidle: Good.
Keep an eye out for it.

30:56.622 --> 31:00.123
Whether he's wearing it,
or maybe he tossed it somewhere.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.927
Uh, listen.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.229
I'm a... I'm a little short.

31:05.231 --> 31:08.932
Could-could you loan me
a few bucks? If-if your...

31:08.934 --> 31:10.067
If your... If your
wallet's around?

31:10.069 --> 31:12.035
That was subtle.

31:13.004 --> 31:13.971
That ain't happening.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.138
But I leant you my car.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.473
I-I had to walk
all the way here.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.943
We link him to the cigarette
and matches

31:19.945 --> 31:21.245
That were used
to start the fire.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.113
Do you know
if caleb smokes that brand?

31:23.115 --> 31:24.982
Tillworth?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.351
Not sure.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.487
Jeremy:
<i>It's-it's...</i>

31:30.489 --> 31:31.989
It's just a few bucks.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.458
I-I wanted to buy
a pack of cigs.

31:34.460 --> 31:38.295
'less I can...
I can bum one from you?

31:41.332 --> 31:43.400
Why don't you come inside
with me?

31:47.372 --> 31:49.940
Mitch, can you

31:49.942 --> 31:51.308
Maintain a visual?

31:51.310 --> 31:52.242
(over radio): Negative.
We're blocked.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.677
Adjusting position.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.946
Caleb: Man to man, jeremy,
you on something?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.314
Jeremy:
What do you mean?

31:57.316 --> 31:58.482
Caleb:
The way you're acting.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.350
The way you parked
your car last night,

32:00.352 --> 32:02.185
Blocking the door.
Nearly burned me to death.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.687
Makes me think
your mind's not straight.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.623
Shrooms? Pills?

32:06.625 --> 32:09.026
I don't know... Acid?

32:09.028 --> 32:09.960
Acid?

32:09.962 --> 32:11.962
(click, hissing)

32:11.964 --> 32:14.031
(screaming over radio)
go, mitch! Go!

32:18.002 --> 32:22.139
(screaming)

32:22.141 --> 32:23.941
On the floor! Now!

32:26.611 --> 32:29.613
(grunts)

32:29.615 --> 32:31.148
Stop!

32:32.550 --> 32:35.218
(grunts)

32:35.220 --> 32:37.287
(gun cocks)

32:37.289 --> 32:39.222
(grunts, coughs)

32:39.224 --> 32:42.159
Officer:
Get him up!

32:42.161 --> 32:44.428
Let's go.
Go!

32:50.134 --> 32:52.369
(distant dog barking,
siren approaching)

32:56.207 --> 33:00.277
I think you might've stumbled
on an odd premonition,

33:00.279 --> 33:04.114
Hating timo for
his skin, because

33:04.116 --> 33:06.450
His skin, or at least
little chunks of it,

33:06.452 --> 33:08.151
Caught in your chain here.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.753
I'm gonna put you
away for murder.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.555
Brass: And add the
hate crime component,

33:11.557 --> 33:13.323
And your peculiar

33:13.325 --> 33:17.527
Method of clean-up--
that's death row easy.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.131
Mutual...

33:21.133 --> 33:23.266
Combat.

33:23.268 --> 33:27.270
That wetback's first mistake
was walking in the place.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.207
<i>Second mistake</i>
<i>was opening his mouth.</i>

33:30.209 --> 33:31.308
You got a problem with me?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.610
Bunch of redneck bitches!

33:33.612 --> 33:34.544
(grunting)

33:50.328 --> 33:53.630
(grunts, gasps)

33:53.632 --> 33:56.366
Didn't mean
for it to end that way.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.368
Told jeremy
to bring the car around

33:58.370 --> 34:01.271
So I could drag the kid out,

34:01.273 --> 34:02.706
Drive him to the hospital.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.307
He was dead,
and you knew it,

34:04.309 --> 34:05.776
So you dragged him
into the club floor,

34:05.778 --> 34:07.778
You dumped him on the floor,
and then you torched

34:07.780 --> 34:10.247
The whole scene.
I didn't set that fire.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.648
Oh, so, what was it?

34:11.650 --> 34:14.317
A thousand-degree
coincidence?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.319
Huh?

34:16.321 --> 34:18.388
Pack enough rage in a room,

34:18.390 --> 34:20.524
Sometimes you get lucky.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.692
I didn't start your fire,

34:22.694 --> 34:25.662
But I know who did.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.497
And seeing as though
he incinerated

34:27.499 --> 34:29.466
Three good, proud white people,

34:29.468 --> 34:31.635
Why don't I tell you
what he looked like?

34:34.272 --> 34:36.073
Are you believing any of this?

34:36.075 --> 34:37.574
No.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.311
Okay, chuckles, go for it.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.347
About to bang heads
with the kid,

34:44.349 --> 34:45.782
I saw him crouched in a corner.

34:45.784 --> 34:49.319
(indistinct shouting)

34:49.321 --> 34:52.789
<i>Came out a minute later,</i>
<i>and I saw what he was up to.</i>

34:52.791 --> 34:55.258
Russell:
<i>Would you recognize him again?</i>

34:55.260 --> 34:58.228
Him?

34:58.230 --> 35:00.297
None of those.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.202
He had on a black t-shirt.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.204
Some kind of logo.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.106
Death's-head maybe.

35:11.576 --> 35:13.710
Shirt like this?

35:13.712 --> 35:16.379
Yeah.

35:16.381 --> 35:19.282
Who was wearing that?

35:19.284 --> 35:22.419
John doe number three.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.388
He's on life support
at desert palm hospital.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.125
Okay.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.160
(monitor beeping)

35:54.919 --> 35:56.486
(device beeps)

36:01.292 --> 36:03.360
(device beeps)

36:09.700 --> 36:10.901
(device beeps)

36:14.639 --> 36:16.640
(computer blipping)
<i>suspect's name is</i>

36:16.642 --> 36:20.944
Ian baxton, and he's blazed
a pretty long sheet.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.345
Multiple priors for arson.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.614
Still on probation
for a torched warehouse.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.184
Stokes:
Pull up his case history.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.418
Okay.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.188
He's got a signature m.O.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.322
Tillworth cigarette,

36:32.324 --> 36:34.457
Rubber-banded
with matches.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.327
Just like what you found at
the club-- that makes it easy.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.596
It should've been a lot easier.

36:41.433 --> 36:46.503
Or out, should donnelly's mom
trap you in her bedroom.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.504
(chuckles)

36:47.506 --> 36:49.639
Square up and let 'er rip.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.875
Miller. I think
we need to talk

36:51.877 --> 36:54.444
For a second.
Kind of in the middle
of something here, chief.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.880
Oh, really? Hey, boys,
what's he teaching you,

36:56.882 --> 36:59.282
How to jeopardize
a quadruple homicide case?

36:59.284 --> 37:00.417
Take a break, fellas.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.385
What the hell
you talking about?

37:02.387 --> 37:03.820
Finlay: Well,
we just found out

37:03.822 --> 37:06.456
That you worked
ian baxton's arsons.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.391
Yeah.
So you knew his signature.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.527
And when we found
that signature at the club,

37:10.529 --> 37:11.962
You didn't say anything.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.997
'cause I followed up
on that lead, solo.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.498
I checked with his p.O.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.469
That's what he told his p.O.
Before he ditched out of work.

37:19.471 --> 37:23.373
Yeah? Do you know
where he is right now?

37:23.375 --> 37:26.343
Home. Look, I'll get
confirmation if you
want, all right?

37:26.345 --> 37:28.511
But I've studied this guy.
Occupied buildings

37:28.513 --> 37:30.447
Are not his style, okay?

37:30.449 --> 37:32.849
He's in
the burn ward.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.417
Well, he got
caught up in a fire

37:34.419 --> 37:36.019
That he started, but...

37:36.021 --> 37:37.787
Come on,
if you'd have mentioned

37:37.789 --> 37:39.356
That you knew
the signature,

37:39.358 --> 37:40.757
We'd have solved it yesterday.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.895
Nothing to say?

37:45.897 --> 37:47.497
It's my bad.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.798
Your bad?

37:53.671 --> 37:55.605
Hey, guys, there's something
else you should know.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.008
Baxton only burns for hire.

37:59.477 --> 38:01.678
7,500 bucks...

38:01.680 --> 38:05.348
In a paper bag,
under the arsonist's mattress.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.450
That's the exact
amount that you got

38:07.452 --> 38:09.452
When you pawned
your prized guitar.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.820
You showed us
the receipt.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.422
You pawn your guitar,
and you...

38:12.424 --> 38:14.291
Pay the arsonist,

38:14.293 --> 38:15.458
You collect the insurance.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.761
I think I may have
mentioned this before,

38:17.763 --> 38:20.664
But I pawned the guitar
to save my club.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.065
You're wasting
your time.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.402
Your fingerprints are
all over the bag, stu.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.570
We got you. It's over.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.039
So can we talk?

38:29.041 --> 38:31.408
I'd really like to
know why you did this.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.443
You want out of the club,
you need the cash,

38:33.445 --> 38:35.645
Why didn't you just
sell the dump?

38:35.647 --> 38:37.847
Dump? Come on.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.849
You sound like those
real estate crooks.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.319
Uh... "hey, stu...

38:42.321 --> 38:45.522
You know, it's a tear-down;
you can't even give it away."

38:45.524 --> 38:47.624
I spent 30 years
of my life

38:47.626 --> 38:49.526
Busting my hump for that place.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.061
And you know what?

38:51.063 --> 38:53.630
For a long time,
I did pretty good.

38:53.632 --> 38:56.599
So why'd you want out so bad
that you torched the place?

38:56.601 --> 38:58.868
I mean, see, that...
I don't understand that.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.906
Can't tell me
you don't see it.

39:02.908 --> 39:07.544
You've been around-- a guy
in your line of work? What?

39:07.546 --> 39:10.046
What is it I don't see?

39:11.482 --> 39:15.018
The world's getting nastier.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.587
It's getting hard to stomach,
don't you think?

39:17.589 --> 39:19.756
Day after day.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.925
You see the way
these kids act, huh?

39:21.927 --> 39:23.693
They're animals.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.764
They get up on the stage,
and the stuff that they spout!

39:27.766 --> 39:30.367
They spit right in my face
if I get in their way.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.635
They're kids, stu.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.704
Young, stupid kids!

39:37.041 --> 39:40.443
You set a fire
in a club full of kids

39:40.445 --> 39:43.947
Because it's less suspicious
than torching it empty?

39:43.949 --> 39:47.684
<i>They're</i> animals?
Give me a break.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.552
What's that make you?

39:49.554 --> 39:51.788
(sighs heavily)

39:52.957 --> 39:55.692
I didn't think the fire
would spread that fast.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.561
I thought they'd have
time to get out of there.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.498
Well, your timing was off.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.932
By three.

40:18.115 --> 40:21.818
It's called the death spiral.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.187
It's created by the pheromones
the ants put out

40:24.189 --> 40:26.055
To warn the colony of danger.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.525
Each ant just follows
the one in front of it.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.194
Blindly circling
in an endless loop.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.663
Mindless conformity.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.532
Has its advantages.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.501
Like what?

40:38.503 --> 40:40.737
Well, you don't see
any of them

40:40.739 --> 40:43.473
Wrapping chains around
each other's throats,

40:43.475 --> 40:45.842
Or burning each other up
for money.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.745
That's true.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.613
But, then, I bet...

40:50.615 --> 40:52.682
You won't see any of them
stepping out of line

40:52.684 --> 40:54.684
To write a symphony or...

40:54.686 --> 40:56.820
Pursue enlightenment, either.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.156
Yeah, it's a bit
of a trade-off, I guess.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.891
How long do they
go on like that?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.693
Well, till they
drop dead from exhaustion.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.030
Or until some kind soul...

41:07.032 --> 41:09.732
Disrupts the spiral.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.768
Man, I ain't stickin'
my hand in there.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.670
You do it.
You be a benevolent god.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.738
All right.

41:16.674 --> 41:19.542
Okay, little guys...

41:19.544 --> 41:21.544
Be free.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.615
Look at that. Wow.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.250
Well...

41:27.252 --> 41:29.686
Hey, lookie there.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.754
I think that's beethoven.
