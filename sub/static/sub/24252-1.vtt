01:06.700 --> 01:08.000
Did you know moving

01:08.102 --> 01:10.269
is the third most
stressful life event.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.538
Is "Having a baby"
on that list too?

01:15.176 --> 01:18.343
Ah, honey, I'm sorry,
I gotta work that day.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.978
All right, look,
maybe I can ask my boss...

01:20.081 --> 01:22.081
No. No, no, no.
It's just a check-up, it's fine.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.415
Are you sure?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.017
Yeah, you don't wanna
rock the boat

01:25.119 --> 01:26.418
with the new job so early.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.686
You can meet Dr. Collins later.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.921
I just hate that
I'm gonna be missing

01:29.023 --> 01:30.089
all these things.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.524
Well, you're keeping us afloat.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.327
Like, we're lucky your mom
left us this house.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.096
So much of her stuff.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.831
Yeah, it's just, it's too big.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.365
It's not really us.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.668
I know.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.004
We get to raise our daughter
in a home. You know?

01:46.107 --> 01:48.640
She can play outside
and go to a good school.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.143
Have all the things
I didn't have.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.444
Look, all the kid needs

01:52.546 --> 01:54.813
is for us to love her
and each other.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.015
The rest is gravy.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.118
I just wanna make sure that
you're happy here.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.519
It's important to me.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.657
Eloise will have
everything she needs,

02:05.759 --> 02:07.726
and that will make me happy.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.864
Look how cute she is.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.932
She sure is.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.203
She's got your eyes.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.141
What time is it?
- Oh, shoot.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.175
Uh, my briefcase.
I've gotta...

02:23.277 --> 02:25.577
Uh, downstairs, office box.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.246
What's that about?

02:27.348 --> 02:29.148
Nothing, I just had a pain
in my chest this morning.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.917
It's, it's nothing.
- How do you know it's nothing?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.219
Internet.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.488
Don't screw around
with your health, okay?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.856
Let the doctors decide
it's not a big deal.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.491
Okay, okay, I'll go.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.293
You're gonna be late.
- Fine.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.698
She's all set. They're gonna get
your paperwork together.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.235
Okay. It's just heartburn,
right? There's nothing else?

02:50.337 --> 02:53.172
Actually, everything
is looking really great.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.274
Unfortunately, you're gonna
have to lay off the lasagna.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.942
Uh, what's the point of living?
- I know.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.844
Hi, Dr. Collins.
- Hello.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.513
It was great meeting you,
and I will

03:01.615 --> 03:02.681
see you at our next appointment.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.715
Thanks.

03:03.817 --> 03:04.716
Here you go.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.984
Thank you.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.094
Oh, oh, wait, I got it.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.362
Oh.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.065
Thank you.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.234
Of course.
- It was gonna get ugly.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.369
Ooh, heartburn, huh?

03:24.471 --> 03:26.972
What?
- I just know that look.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.740
Oh.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.710
Yeah, I basically had a whole
lasagna last night, so...

03:31.812 --> 03:34.146
Women in the third trimester,
it's like a curse.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.148
No lasagna?
What's the point of living?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.284
I just said that.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.452
I'm Jina.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.321
Sara. Nice to meet you.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.923
I know a great acupressure point
if you're interested.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.959
Uh...

03:47.061 --> 03:50.128
I'm a midwife. Not just some
weirdo in the car park.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.165
Here. It's, uh...
- Okay.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.466
It's two finger widths just from

03:54.568 --> 03:55.801
the crease of your wrist, here.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.470
Okay.
- And you just apply pressure.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.306
Take a deep breath.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.841
It's great for, uh,

04:02.943 --> 04:06.411
anxiety, nausea, tummy upsets.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.180
Definitely anxiety.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.482
Perfect.
I have all of those things.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.584
Yeah.
- Especially the anxiety.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.952
Yeah, it's really important

04:14.054 --> 04:16.255
to just try
and take a breath sometimes.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.959
I feel like it's working, is it
supposed to work that fast?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.462
Great.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.596
Wow.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.832
Thank you. That was amazing.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.533
And now I'm starving again.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.838
This might be weird,
but do you wanna grab lunch?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.108
Actually, I'd love that.
- Great.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.110
I think I know a place
I've been wanting to go to.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.511
Yeah, that would be awesome.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.046
All right, follow me.
- I'll follow you.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.381
Perfect.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.120
So cute.
- Yeah.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.321
Oh, hi there.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.389
Uh, grab a seat
wherever you like,

04:50.491 --> 04:51.657
I'll get you some menus.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.292
Thanks.
- Should we sit here?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.760
Yeah.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.832
So, where are you from?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.034
Here, I live here.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.370
You don't have an accent.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.307
Oh. Sorry, I just moved here
a little while back.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.676
I'm... kinda starting over, too.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.077
I just hear
you two are new.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.345
Welcome to Kentucky.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.080
Thank you.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.350
Yeah, just, uh, moved out
from L.A. with my husband.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.418
L.A.?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.453
Wait. Danny?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.422
Yeah.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.424
It-it's a small town.
I heard he moved back.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.926
So, you're Danny's wife.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.362
I'm Sara.
- Allie.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.332
Ooh, I love your mood ring.
- Thank you.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.100
According to this,
I'm always in a good mood.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.602
I-I went to school
with Danny.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.372
I was so sorry to hear about
his mom. She was so great.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.074
Wasn't she amazing?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.343
Honestly, she was more of
a mother to me than my own mom.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.711
I really miss her.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.945
Yeah, she used to come in here

05:47.047 --> 05:48.280
every Sunday after church.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.548
She would always get the...

05:49.650 --> 05:51.249
Hot brown.
- Hot brown. Oh.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.751
Jinx. Buy me a coke.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.921
What's a hot brown?

05:56.023 --> 05:59.725
Uh, it's... toast, with turkey
and bacon and mornay sauce.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.093
It's really good.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.861
Well, how about a couple
in her honor?

06:02.963 --> 06:04.396
Yes.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.465
Oh, you should probably
hold off.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.101
It sounds really good
but really rich.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.402
Maybe for the heartburn...

06:10.504 --> 06:12.404
Yeah. Okay, hang on.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.174
Mediterranean salad please.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.612
I might get the hot brown.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.047
Uh, yeah.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.582
Sorry.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.317
Uh, anything to drink?

06:25.419 --> 06:28.220
I'll get a sweet tea, please.
- Just water for me.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.921
Mm, no caffeine
for the baby?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.223
Yeah.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.624
Well, I will get going

06:32.726 --> 06:34.393
on the hot brown
and the salad,

06:34.495 --> 06:37.829
and I will be right back
with your delicious water.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.197
Thanks.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.167
She's great.
- Yeah.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.637
I guess you must
miss L.A.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.640
Must be so much fun.
- Yeah.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.909
You know, we were gonna
sell the house out here,

06:51.011 --> 06:53.011
but then this job opportunity
came up for Danny,

06:53.113 --> 06:55.347
and that just made sense,
you know?

06:55.449 --> 06:58.150
Were you working?
- Yeah, I worked at a law firm.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.018
Wow, you're a lawyer.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.921
Yeah, well... not here.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.856
I still have to take the bar.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.091
Which reminds me,
I should probably start

07:06.193 --> 07:08.193
studying for the bar.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.695
And you gave all that up
just for Danny.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.098
My job?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.133
No! No, no,
I, I'll go back to it.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.370
I just, um,
I wanted to give Eloise

07:18.472 --> 07:20.772
the whole Americana childhood,
you know?

07:20.874 --> 07:23.041
Where she can play outside on...

07:23.143 --> 07:24.376
a lawn that isn't yellow.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.279
But it's no big city.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.881
No.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.517
I don't know, just post a few
pictures on social media

07:32.619 --> 07:34.119
and friends will come running.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.855
Yeah, I don't really do that
social media stuff.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.758
Oh, yeah. Family problems?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.695
You just mentioned your mom.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.796
Yeah.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.866
Whoa, you're good.
Um...

07:47.968 --> 07:50.769
Let's just say I have people
I don't wanna connect with.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.507
I get it. Sorry for prying.
- No, not at all.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.876
My mum's kind of
a whack-a-doodle too.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.978
So sorry. Uh, Sara,
in case you didn't know,

08:00.080 --> 08:03.482
there is a Mommy Meetup here,
every Wednesday.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.251
Mommy Meetup? What's that?
Is that like a gang?

08:06.353 --> 08:08.386
It sounds like a gang.
It's a gang, isn't it?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.722
Just tell Kelly how much you
love her purse.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.357
Tell her it's real fancy.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.160
She's the organizer, and she can
be a bit, you know...

08:15.262 --> 08:17.095
Gotcha. I don't know,
I don't wanna intrude.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.064
No, no, you should totally go.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.366
You should totally go.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.435
Okay, I'll... Maybe I'll go.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.936
I'll think about it.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.340
Hm.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.943
Thanks.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.413
Well, it was so nice
to meet you.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.715
Thank you so much for today.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.850
This was so nice.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.619
Honestly, I was nervous
being here.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.888
You... made me feel
a little better.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.356
Of course.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.590
It's my job,

08:45.692 --> 08:47.692
make pregnant women feel better.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.061
I'm like a lighthouse guiding
them through their hormonal fog

08:50.163 --> 08:52.864
and helping them
avoid the dangers around them.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.466
Can you be my midwife?
- Oh.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.268
Sorry.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.271
I... It's just, you make me feel
so much better already, and...

09:00.807 --> 09:02.474
I would be really grateful.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.075
You've only got six more weeks,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.144
and I promise, you're doing
so great without me.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.080
Yeah, I'm a mess.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.149
This is a facade.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.318
To be honest, I generally prefer
to start with people

09:13.420 --> 09:15.754
at the beginning
of their pregnancy.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.389
I always wanted to have
a natural birth.

09:17.491 --> 09:20.725
I didn't think I'd find anyone
here to help me with it.

09:20.827 --> 09:24.462
Meeting you...
feel like it's fate.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.931
All right,
you talked me into it.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.499
Really?
- Yeah.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.234
I'm gonna pay you,
it's not like a friend thing.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.269
No, no, no. It...

09:31.371 --> 09:34.172
I'll give you a huge discount
from my usual rate. Sound good?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.675
Yay, that would be great.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.276
Awesome.
- Can I...

09:38.378 --> 09:40.645
Thank you.
- Oh.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.314
This is gonna be fun.
- Yes.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.983
Hm...

09:45.085 --> 09:47.786
So, a midwife, huh?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.955
How'd you find a midwife
out here?

09:50.057 --> 09:53.291
She was at the hospital.
It was totally fate.

09:53.393 --> 09:57.996
Oh. Well, I...
You needed a midwife.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.165
You have no idea
what a midwife is, do you?

10:00.267 --> 10:01.533
No.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.437
They specialize in pregnancy,

10:05.539 --> 10:06.671
um...

10:06.773 --> 10:09.708
labor, delivery, postpartum.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.510
They're trained to deal
with any high-risk situations.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.112
Mm-hm.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.448
She's a lighthouse...

10:16.550 --> 10:19.384
guiding pregnant women
through their hormonal fog

10:19.486 --> 10:22.721
and helping them avoid
the dangers all around them.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.889
That's great.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.325
I just don't feel anxious
around her.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.628
You know, she makes me
feel so calm.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.630
I love her already.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.065
I was telling her
about your mom.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.836
How great she was,
and... how supportive.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.373
Remember, she used to send me
late-night pizzas in law school?

10:42.743 --> 10:44.576
She's my mom goal.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.313
Hey.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.882
You don't need to try so hard.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.417
You're you.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.819
And havin' a terrible mother

10:54.921 --> 10:58.156
doesn't mean that you're gonna
be a terrible mother.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.491
That's not how it works.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.529
What if I just looked down
at my baby one day...

11:04.631 --> 11:07.399
and feel... trapped?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.968
Like I gave up something.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.570
It's possible.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.140
That doesn't scare you?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.544
No, not one bit.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.247
Because I'm not gonna let you
feel trapped.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.782
And you're not gonna let me
feel trapped...

11:24.685 --> 11:26.384
because we're a team.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.852
Okay?

11:28.555 --> 11:29.954
I promise.

11:30.857 --> 11:31.890
And I'm here for you.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.892
I know.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.729
The fact that you're massaging
my feet right now says it all.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.064
Yeah.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.198
I know.
- Yeah.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.399
I know how you are.
- Yeah.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.400
I'm probably gonna
have nightmares.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.069
I know, sorry.
- For sure.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.769
Hey.
- Hi.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.938
I made you a killer lasagna.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.240
Special recipe, guaranteed
not to give you heartburn.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.943
That is so sweet of you.
Come on in.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.512
Oh, your house is beautiful.
- Thank you.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.014
This way.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.083
This smells so good.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.686
Okay.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.857
So, I thought we could get
started on your birth plan.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.458
Sounds great.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.894
Danny and I haven't figured out
what we wanna do yet.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.729
So I just need to figure out
how to not go insane

12:44.831 --> 12:46.030
over the next couple weeks.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.767
Well, I have tons of ideas.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.702
Actually, I thought
we could get started by

12:50.804 --> 12:53.271
enrolling you in some
pre-natal yoga classes.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.606
How does that sound?

12:54.708 --> 12:57.142
I'm from L.A., so I love yoga

12:57.244 --> 12:58.276
and avocados.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.647
Great. Well, we can start off
with some morning classes

13:02.749 --> 13:04.315
and just ease you
back into it gradually.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.717
Perfect.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.418
Do you want some wine?

13:07.521 --> 13:10.054
I can, uh, watch you drink it.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.459
No, actual octuplets.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.594
That was good.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.062
Oh.
- Hey.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.332
Hey. I'm good, honey.
- How's it going, ladies?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.234
How you doing?
Good.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.636
Hey.
This is Jina.

13:24.738 --> 13:25.737
Our midwife.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.172
It is so nice to meet you.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.239
Daniel. Um...

13:28.341 --> 13:29.340
Sara's been nothing but smiles

13:29.442 --> 13:30.441
since she met you.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.243
Glad to hear it.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.179
We've been going through
our plan for the next few weeks,

13:34.281 --> 13:37.282
and, uh, she's telling me
all these pregnancy stories

13:37.384 --> 13:39.350
'cause she has seen it all.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.253
And more.
- Yeah, I bet.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.656
Oh, goodness,
I better get going.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.791
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

13:46.893 --> 13:48.459
No, no, no, I'll let you guys

13:48.562 --> 13:50.261
do your lovebird thing.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.597
She made me non-burny lasagna.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.632
Pfft, I'm in.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.100
Please stay.
We could use the company.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.337
Okay then.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.872
Great.
- Good.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.352
<i>So, are you gonna
go to that</i>

14:14.454 --> 14:16.020
<i>Mommy Meetup group tomorrow?</i>

14:16.122 --> 14:17.789
Mommy Meetup?

14:17.891 --> 14:20.225
It's a mothers' group.
They get together once a week.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.660
It's like a support network.
- Oh.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.229
Sounds perfect.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.797
Mm, I don't know.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.399
I never know what to say
at those things.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.802
Well, I think it could be
really good for you.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.372
It's important to be around
other mothers. It helps.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.041
Maybe just bring a big salad
and a huge smile,

14:37.143 --> 14:38.142
and you'll be fine.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.147
Oh, this is so weird.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.416
I feel like
a science experiment.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.920
I feel like this isn't my body.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.155
Oh, yeah,
it was the same with me.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.193
Uh, you have kids?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.661
No, I...

14:59.332 --> 15:00.999
My baby was stillborn.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.370
I'm so sorry.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.171
I lost him
in the third trimester.

15:09.109 --> 15:12.076
We had, uh, losses, too,

15:12.178 --> 15:14.345
but... nothing that late.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.315
I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.518
It's okay.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.354
It was a rough couple of years.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.024
My husband left, and then
I had to move in with my mom

15:26.126 --> 15:29.961
who isn't the easiest person
to live with.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.397
But I managed to
get through school,

15:32.499 --> 15:34.098
get my midwife license,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.733
get out of there.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.137
Actually, I understand that,
too.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.906
My mom, uh, took out a bunch of
credit cards in my name

15:42.008 --> 15:45.243
and wrecked my credits, so, we
have to stay away from her too.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.378
Well, I've managed to
save up enough now, so...

15:47.480 --> 15:50.114
I'm really close to
getting my own place.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.051
For now, I'm just staying
in a motel.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.087
The only bummer is there doesn't
seem to be a huge demand

15:56.189 --> 15:57.889
for midwives around here.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.392
Um, I'm sorry.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.962
This is way too much
information.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.731
No, I mean, embarrassing.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.100
You're about to see all of this

16:09.202 --> 16:11.336
very soon, so...

16:11.438 --> 16:12.503
just...

16:12.605 --> 16:16.074
we're way past embarrassing.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.775
Sorry.

16:17.877 --> 16:18.943
You should stay with us,

16:19.045 --> 16:20.645
at least for a little while,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.314
you know, while you
find a place to stay.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.183
Please stay,
we have so much room.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.284
Oh.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.319
Yeah, plenty of room.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.854
And don't, don't be embarrassed,
you know?

16:29.956 --> 16:31.255
Like, everyone needs
help sometimes,

16:31.358 --> 16:33.024
and you're helping me so much.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.727
So, why don't you just stay
with us till you find a place?

16:35.962 --> 16:39.030
I mean, I do really
hate that motel.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.466
Great.

16:41.568 --> 16:50.408
Done.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.313
Hello.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.382
Hello, hello, you're new.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.751
Welcome to Mommy Meetup.
I'm Kelly.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.319
I'm Sara.
Nice to meet you.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.787
Ah, and you brought a salad.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.789
You didn't have to.
We have food here.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.458
Oh, I, I didn't know.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.294
Ladies, I'd like you to meet
our new friend Sarah.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.296
Is that Sarah with an H?

17:12.398 --> 17:14.965
Uh, no, just an A on the end.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.634
Fancy.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.236
Hi, it's nice to meet you guys.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.239
Um, we just moved here from L.A.
a few weeks ago.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.840
Yes, and Sara brought us
a salad.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.310
Tsk. Ah, yup.
It's kale and quinoa,

17:26.413 --> 17:27.678
one of my favorites.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.981
Quinoa?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.517
Tsk.
- It's a grain, Amanda.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.951
I've had it before.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.020
And kale. Interesting.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.356
Oh, a quinoa salad.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.324
I'll have to get that recipe
from you, Sara.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.360
It might be great for the menu.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.432
Someone pour her some sweet tea.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.368
Oh. No, thank you,
actually.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.970
You don't like sweet tea?

17:53.073 --> 17:57.642
Oh. No, I love it. I just... I'm
avoiding caffeine and sugar.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.611
Hm. I'd never be able to
give up my sweet tea.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.513
You're so dedicated.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.549
Oh.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.684
Mommy Meetup!
- Mommy Meetup!

18:10.957 --> 18:13.624
Let's take a selfie.
- Oh, no.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.960
Sorry. No, thank you.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.129
What? Why not?
It's not a big deal,

18:18.231 --> 18:19.831
it's just for our Facebook page.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.467
I just don't do Facebook...
and stuff.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.968
Tsk. What for?

18:24.070 --> 18:25.937
You hidin' somethin'?

18:26.039 --> 18:29.907
No, I just, uh, have some
family... issues...

18:31.511 --> 18:33.978
So, you moved here
a few weeks ago?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.246
Yeah, into
my mother-in-law's house

18:35.348 --> 18:36.347
on Cochrane.

18:36.449 --> 18:40.017
Oh! Daniel's mom.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.053
Tsk. I went to school
with Danny.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.922
I was a couple of years behind
him, though, obviously.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.524
That's great.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.025
So, when are you due?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.094
Ah, six more weeks.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.596
Can't wait.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.198
You okay?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.233
Yeah,
it's just a headache.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.267
I think it's allergies.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.335
Do you guys get those?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.836
Oh, no problem,

18:58.938 --> 19:00.571
we mommies
have it all covered.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.373
I have some meds.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.242
Oh, no, thank you so much.
I'll be okay.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.612
It's just Tylenol.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.947
Yeah, I just try not
to take anything

19:10.049 --> 19:11.682
unless I really need it,
you know?

19:12.886 --> 19:14.952
My doctor said it was okay.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.287
Oh, I'm sure it is.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.056
He seemed reputable.
My doctor.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.626
No, no, no, of course.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.861
Are you a doctor?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.930
No, I'm a lawyer, actually.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.700
Oh. That makes sense.

19:31.538 --> 19:35.106
I just didn't wanna take
any risks, you know?

19:35.208 --> 19:38.309
Right. So, how about that salad?

19:38.411 --> 19:41.078
Yeah, um, I'm actually gonna run
to the restroom really quick,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.314
uh, for the millionth time
today.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.887
Hey, what's up?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.222
Oh, I'm fine.
- Whoa, wait, wait.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.657
What happened?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.492
Did you forget to compliment
Kelly's purse?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.394
Yes.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.396
Forgot about the purse.
I panicked.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.464
Um, they're really nice.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.999
I just... They all really know
each other,

20:02.101 --> 20:03.801
and I don't really fit in, and

20:03.903 --> 20:05.269
I brought this weird salad.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.504
Why am I crying over salad?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.139
Uh, okay. Phone.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.175
My... Oh.
- Come on.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.314
Here is my number.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.583
I'm officially your friend,
and I am awesome.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.785
So call or text me anytime.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.588
Uh, but no emojis, okay?
I hate those things.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.956
Little weird faces.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.791
Yeah, they really creep me out.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.192
Me too.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.161
See? I knew
we were gonna be BFFs.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.064
Thank you.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.850
This house is amazing.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.084
It's like a museum.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.986
Danny's mom treated it like one.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.321
Hm.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.490
All she needed
was an armed guard.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.425
Oh, there's a gun
and everything.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.727
Really?
- Yeah.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.762
Someone has to protect her

21:37.864 --> 21:39.230
porcelain fawn collection.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.266
I'm actually
not a big fan of guns,

21:42.368 --> 21:43.868
so Danny put it
in the bedroom safe.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.670
We'll get rid of it
when all of this calms down.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.072
Yeah, they kinda freak me out.
- Me too.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.541
Oh.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.943
I have a surprise for you.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.779
To say thank you
for your generosity.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.847
Thank you so much.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.616
I'm gonna open it right now.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.456
Oh, I love it.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.192
It's supposed to ignite
the flames of romance.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.593
Oh.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.295
I know it can be hard to
keep those fires lit

22:11.397 --> 22:12.430
during pregnancy.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.464
What, with all the excess

22:13.566 --> 22:14.865
weight gain and stretch marks.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.435
It can be kinda
hard to be sexy.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.437
But I thought you could put it
in your room.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.506
I will. Thank you.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.444
And now I have to
use the restroom again.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.346
When I get back,
we have to do something fun.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.847
Sounds good.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.021
Ugh, that meetup was brutal.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.624
I'm sorry.
Those moms are harmless.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.693
I mean, yeah, it sucks,
but it's good

23:15.795 --> 23:17.094
for you to be
around other mothers.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.996
Honestly, I'd love to fit in
with them.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.298
I'm not trying to be elitist
or anything, I...

23:21.401 --> 23:23.801
I genuinely think
they're nice people.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.637
Maybe you should just start
taking a ton of selfies.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.205
Okay, I thought
that was just me,

23:28.307 --> 23:29.774
but they take
a lot of photos, right?

23:29.876 --> 23:32.109
Well, that's how
the world works.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.944
If you don't post it online,
it-it never happened.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.180
No, of course not.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.516
I can help you with that,
if you want.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.518
Uh... hmm.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.721
It's very complicated.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.856
Here is the camera.
- Mm-hm.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.360
And then
I just take a quick snap.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.630
Yup, uh...

23:52.732 --> 23:54.298
And you're right, that,
that's terrible, that's...

23:54.400 --> 23:56.700
Mean.
- It's really terrible.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.569
You're so mean.

23:58.671 --> 23:59.870
But seriously, though,
don't post that,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.539
'cause I, I can't do
social media,

24:01.641 --> 24:04.375
so... don't post it.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.744
Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.379
I do think we should
take photos, though.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.381
For Eloise. She's gonna wanna
see you like this.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.916
You're beautiful.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.321
Okay, you're right.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.358
Here, hold this.
I'll get a better angle.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.760
Better light.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.862
All right.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.230
Smile.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.365
Lawyers don't smile,
it's in the rules.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.334
Actually, I don't know, like,

24:30.436 --> 24:32.169
give it some vibe, like,
I don't know,

24:32.271 --> 24:33.938
like, just, loosen up
a little bit.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.273
Um, how about you pretend
you're at a party

24:36.375 --> 24:38.242
and you're drinking?

24:38.344 --> 24:41.045
What?
- I don't know, have a drink.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.146
Go nuts.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.583
There we go.
One, two, three.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.285
Perfect.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.788
That's great.
- Honey, I'm home.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.356
Hey, baby.

24:52.458 --> 24:56.227
What have you two wild ladies
been up to?

24:56.329 --> 24:58.462
We've been taking selfies.

24:58.564 --> 25:02.032
Sara... taking a photo?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.969
We're not posting them
or anything, right?

25:05.071 --> 25:06.871
Promise.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.639
Oh, I have something
I have to show you.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.541
Ah.
- Here.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.377
Hey.
- Hi.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.749
Danny...

25:18.851 --> 25:21.485
um, we missed you
at dinner tonight.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.721
I saved you some leftovers,
if you want them.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.389
I, uh, you know,
actually, I'm good.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.791
I, I ate at my desk,
but thank you.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.834
Oh, my gosh.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.235
I can barely...

25:39.705 --> 25:42.773
I can barely... feel you.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.874
Mm-hm.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.379
So... how'd it go?
How was your day?

25:48.481 --> 25:50.848
Mm... Unh-unh.
- Come on.

25:53.553 --> 25:57.254
Come on, how was the mommy
gang initiation?

25:58.724 --> 26:00.591
Oh. I cried.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.129
I mean, I know, at this point,

26:05.231 --> 26:07.131
I, I cry at dog food
commercials,

26:07.233 --> 26:08.999
but I...

26:09.101 --> 26:10.935
I made one friend.
- Yeah.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.836
Allie. She's fun.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.606
I can't wait to meet her.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.045
You know, I know
we have a long way to go

26:21.147 --> 26:23.781
on the rest of the house,
but I feel like...

26:23.883 --> 26:25.716
this room's finally done.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.217
Mm-hm. Maybe.
- Maybe.

26:28.654 --> 26:31.722
Oh, I forgot the best part.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.524
Okay.
- Oh.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.892
Yeah.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.635
Hans?

26:44.737 --> 26:45.903
Hans? Oh!

26:46.005 --> 26:47.204
I...

26:47.306 --> 26:48.238
Pfft, where'd you...

26:48.341 --> 26:49.840
Where'd you get that?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.643
That... silly bear.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.911
Did you find it in the garbage?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.080
I found him
carefully tucked away

26:56.182 --> 26:57.314
with some of your mom's
old things.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.383
Really?
- Mm-hm.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.785
Um, I forgot all about that.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.321
Right.
- Mm-hm.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.790
Should we put Hans in the crib?

27:07.827 --> 27:08.993
Uh...

27:09.095 --> 27:10.628
I mean, we can,
we can take a look.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.329
We can take a look.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.737
Oh.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.241
Unless you want it in our bed...

27:26.879 --> 27:29.046
No.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.782
I... I guess our kid

27:31.884 --> 27:33.884
should have it.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.854
Oh.
- Stupid bear.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.156
Hm.
- Very generous of you.

27:53.739 --> 27:54.772
Ow.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.908
Oh, you look... comfortable.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.677
I'm not. Hang on.

28:00.713 --> 28:01.979
Okay.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.514
I can do this.

28:03.616 --> 28:05.015
You all right?

28:09.722 --> 28:11.622
Get up for one second.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.257
Just one second. Sorry.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.259
I just...
- Okay. Yeah.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.194
It's so hot.
I'm uncomfortable.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.839
Did you touch the thermostat?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.676
What?

28:32.778 --> 28:34.578
Did you?
- No.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.983
Okay, like, one degree.
- One degree...

28:40.086 --> 28:41.852
You keep it like
an icebox in here.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.687
Okay, well, in the eyes
of the court,

28:43.789 --> 28:46.857
I can reduce my sentence
from murder to manslaughter.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.028
I'm saying I'm legally allowed
to murder you now.

28:51.130 --> 28:55.099
I think what's
important to remember...

28:55.201 --> 28:58.969
is that I love you
and you love me.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.137
Yeah.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.542
I love you.

29:11.650 --> 29:12.983
Get some rest, okay?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.518
Okay.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.987
Everything is looking
really good.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.722
I feel good.
- You seem good.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.191
Oh,
I forgot to tell you.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.193
I hired Jina Anderson
as my midwife.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.194
I should tell you that, right?

29:57.296 --> 29:58.195
It feels like it's something

29:58.297 --> 29:59.196
I should tell you.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.198
No, it's fine, it's fine, uh...

30:01.300 --> 30:03.534
If she makes you feel
more secure, then I'm on board.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.269
Does this mean that
you're gonna have a home birth?

30:05.371 --> 30:06.904
I don't know yet.
- Okay.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.539
Well, just, uh,
keep checkin' in with me

30:08.641 --> 30:09.740
and let me know
how things are going.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.074
Okay.
- Okay?

30:11.177 --> 30:12.476
Thank you.
- All right, see you later.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.918
Okay, when you're ready,

30:21.020 --> 30:22.586
try to come out of the pose.

30:26.559 --> 30:29.760
Uh,
you're so good.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.096
Yeah, well, I had
some ribs removed

30:33.199 --> 30:34.364
to do that one.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.400
It's worth it.
Totally worth it.

30:41.574 --> 30:42.673
That's weird.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.076
Like a cramp or something?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.345
Yeah, kinda like a cramp.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.613
Um...

30:49.715 --> 30:50.647
It's in the front there, right?

30:50.749 --> 30:52.850
Not the back?
- Yeah.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.819
Okay, I'm just gonna have to
feel your abdomen.

30:55.921 --> 30:58.188
Oh, that's pretty hard.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.092
Okay, and you're sure
it's just in the front?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.261
Yeah.
- Okay.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.462
It's all right, it's fine.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.797
It's just Braxton Hicks.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.665
Okay.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.001
Like the practice contractions.
- Yeah.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.636
It's just getting you
ready for the big day.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.605
It's totally normal.

31:14.707 --> 31:17.307
Okay.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.477
Sorry, I know I shouldn't get
so worried, I just...

31:20.579 --> 31:23.213
I just wanna be, I don't know,
prepared or something

31:23.315 --> 31:24.314
'cause we're on again.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.450
No, of course, you're fine.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.119
This is totally normal.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.888
Let's get you upstairs
for some rest.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.289
Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.125
That's it.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.463
All right...

31:39.565 --> 31:41.732
I'm just gonna
get you some tea.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.400
Okay.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.804
Boy, you're really lucky
I came along.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.240
You're so weak.
- Yeah.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.477
Did you do any pre-natal
exercises at all?

31:53.579 --> 31:56.613
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I just get
really dizzy on the stairs.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.516
Okay.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.987
Be sure to lay on
your left side up there.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.222
I will.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.672
Lay back if you can.

32:21.774 --> 32:22.773
Here...

32:23.676 --> 32:25.542
Take some deep breaths.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.248
How are you feeling?

32:31.350 --> 32:33.617
It's actually starting to
get better.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.353
Sara!

32:36.455 --> 32:38.221
I'm up here.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.756
Danny came home?

32:39.858 --> 32:41.258
Yeah, I called him.

32:42.895 --> 32:44.761
Oh.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.596
I thought you left
your phone downstairs.

32:46.699 --> 32:47.698
The landline.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.067
Oh.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.601
What is this, 1994?

32:51.704 --> 32:53.603
Yeah.

32:53.706 --> 32:55.205
Danny's mother had
all the modern conveniences

32:55.307 --> 32:57.541
of the '80s.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.209
We were gonna get
rid of it, but...

32:59.311 --> 33:02.279
cell service is
so spotty out here and...

33:02.381 --> 33:03.981
texting only works with Wi-Fi.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.882
Hey.
Hey.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.617
You okay?
- Ugh, I'm sorry.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.386
I just... We were
doing yoga and I...

33:09.488 --> 33:11.421
S-stop, no, don't be sorry.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.291
It's okay.
- It's just Braxton Hicks.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.792
Ah.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.061
It's like practice labor.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.831
She'll be fine.

33:20.933 --> 33:23.233
It just hurt for a little bit.
It's fine now.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.601
Jina fixed it.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.837
So, you came all the way home.

33:26.939 --> 33:28.772
Yeah.
It's fine.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.841
I'm, I'm super close, so...

33:30.943 --> 33:32.776
I can come running
anytime Sara needs me.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.011
It's good to know.

33:39.885 --> 33:40.917
You okay?
- I'm okay.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.788
Now that I'm locked away
up in my tower...

33:44.890 --> 33:45.922
Oh...

33:57.770 --> 33:59.836
Listen, I brought
some work home.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.371
But, I can, you know,

34:01.473 --> 34:03.040
I can save it for later.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.809
Do you wanna turn on
some reality TV?

34:05.911 --> 34:07.677
Make fun of the crazies?

34:07.780 --> 34:09.012
Watch the little
cray-cray people.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.649
I know, I'm just so tired and...

34:12.751 --> 34:14.784
emotional.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.620
I feel like I messed up.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.288
Like I over-exerted myself

34:18.389 --> 34:19.790
or...

34:19.891 --> 34:21.558
Did Jina seem mad at me?

34:21.659 --> 34:23.293
No, no, not at all.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.029
It's just...

34:26.130 --> 34:28.998
I know she wants me
to take it easy, but...

34:29.101 --> 34:30.300
I can't...

34:30.402 --> 34:31.333
Well, you...

34:31.437 --> 34:34.036
...be cooped up all the time.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.406
You do, uh,
need to get some rest,

34:36.507 --> 34:38.975
okay, so,
just take it easy.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.143
Okay.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.103
You should drop by and surprise
her if you have time.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.071
That's great,
she really needs this.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.174
You know, she's been
so stressed out. See you later.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.210
Yeah, bye.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.678
Have a good day.

35:15.781 --> 35:16.780
Good morning.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.615
How are you feeling?

35:18.717 --> 35:21.852
Good, I can't believe
I slept so much.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.387
That's good.
Your body needed it.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.522
Was Danny...

35:25.624 --> 35:26.690
Oh, he left for work.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.127
Oh, I thought I heard
you guys talking.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.528
Yeah,
but he had to rush out.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.063
He's still behind from yesterday

35:33.165 --> 35:34.865
having to come home for you.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.700
He couldn't
really wait around.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.201
Oh.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.270
Anyhoo, get dressed.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.639
Dressed for what?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.808
I found the most amazing
yoga studio in town.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.042
I wanna take you there.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.544
Can't keep you
cooped up all day.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.253
<i>I just wanna grab
a quick cup of coffee.</i>

35:56.355 --> 35:57.654
Oh, okay, great.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.322
Oh-oh!

35:59.424 --> 36:02.058
Surprise!

36:02.161 --> 36:03.894
What? Did you do this?

36:03.996 --> 36:05.495
Maybe.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.963
You guys...

36:07.065 --> 36:08.465
I wish
I was better dressed.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.534
I didn't wanna
spoil the surprise.

36:12.104 --> 36:14.104
Thank you, thank you so much.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.138
Okay...

36:15.240 --> 36:17.073
I can't cry again.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.242
Aww!

36:32.858 --> 36:34.391
Oh, mine!

36:34.493 --> 36:35.992
Mine, that one's mine.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.299
Oh, I needed one of these.
- Aww!

36:42.401 --> 36:45.235
Thank you, Allie.
- You're welcome.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.838
Uh, next one.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.274
That one's mine.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.411
Oh, you really didn't have to.
This is amazing.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.179
Done more than enough.

37:02.621 --> 37:05.855
<i>d I believe d</i>

37:05.958 --> 37:07.090
Oh, what's it say?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.628
It's Eloise's initials.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.497
Aw.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.833
Thank you. I love it.
Really.

37:16.935 --> 37:20.070
No, Sara, thank you.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.972
Um, Ashley, can we get
some more sweet tea?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.006
Uh, yeah.
- Oh.

37:23.108 --> 37:24.074
But no sweet tea for this one.

37:27.613 --> 37:30.347
Isn't it weird that you
used to date her Danny?

37:30.449 --> 37:32.015
It's weird, right?

37:32.117 --> 37:33.350
Who?

37:33.452 --> 37:35.051
Allie?

37:35.153 --> 37:36.219
Oh, well...

37:36.321 --> 37:38.088
Kind of.

37:38.190 --> 37:40.090
Oh, no, you guys were so cute.

37:40.192 --> 37:43.193
I-I mean it was like maybe
two months during high school.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.762
Oh, gosh, it seemed
longer than that.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.564
How funny.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.033
Yeah, that's really funny.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.535
Um, you know I should probably
get back,

37:52.638 --> 37:56.072
so, you ladies let me know
if you need anything, okay?

37:58.110 --> 38:00.877
Uh, next gift?

38:04.316 --> 38:05.415
Thank you
so much, guys,

38:05.517 --> 38:07.684
I really appreciate all this.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.054
Aw!

38:11.156 --> 38:13.223
Wow, that was in perfect unison.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.924
They've literally been
practicin' it all day.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.860
Yeah, I bet.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.695
You look so handsome.
- Hi, ladies, hey.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.263
Oh.
- There she is.

38:20.365 --> 38:22.565
Aww.
- Hey, baby.

38:22.668 --> 38:23.733
I brought these for you.
- Hi.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.201
How're you doin'?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.304
So good.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.973
I just came by to help you
take home all your loot.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.908
I can't believe you knew.

38:32.010 --> 38:32.942
It was...

38:33.045 --> 38:34.444
really hard not to say anything.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.813
He is so good
at keeping secrets.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.381
We were just talkin'
about you and Allie.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.649
Allie?

38:39.751 --> 38:41.418
Hey, Danny.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.219
AJ?

38:43.322 --> 38:45.288
What... are you doing here?
- Oh.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.457
I haven't been
called that in forever.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.293
Um, actually,
I own this cafe.

38:50.395 --> 38:52.395
Wow.
That's, that's amazing.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.764
Yeah, I feel like
such an idiot.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.499
Uh, when you mentioned
Allie before,

38:56.601 --> 38:58.068
I just, I didn't
make the connection.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.637
We went to school together.
- Yes.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.106
You guys must've been
such a cute couple.

39:04.910 --> 39:08.345
No, it didn't last long.
- Uh, that, uh, Halloween party?

39:08.447 --> 39:10.780
You thought you could breakdance
and then you puked on my shoe.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.750
It's embarrassing,
yeah, thanks for that.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.686
That's like, at our wedding.
Your dancing at our wedding.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.189
This is good, thank you
for bringing me up

39:19.291 --> 39:20.256
and humiliating me.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.592
I'm glad you two met.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.427
Yeah.
- This is good.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.663
Honey, if you have to go back to
work, we can get the stuff home.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.265
Yeah. We've got this.
- Oh, yeah. I-I can help too.

39:29.368 --> 39:30.967
Oh, it's okay.
- No, no, I'd love to.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.669
Uh, Ash, I'm gonna head out.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.504
Just gimme a sec.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.706
Wanna see the stuff?
- Yes, let's see.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.611
No worries,
I've got these ones too.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.348
Today was so lovely.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.350
Thank you so much
for making it happen.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.819
I'm happy to help.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.287
Oh, I might just
get your number.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.722
Just in case you get lost.
- Oh.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.724
I know how to get to Danny's.
- Oh, of course.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.160
But, it's been so long.

39:57.262 --> 40:00.430
Ayee, where is my phone?

40:00.532 --> 40:03.433
Here you go. It's hard to find
anything in this mess.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.973
Great.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.541
I'm just gonna grab
a couple more things.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.076
Of course.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.798
is is.
- Oh, my gosh.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.733
Aw.
- Oh my gosh.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.369
They're so cute.
- So cute dolphins.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.703
Ooh, I don't believe...
It's amazing.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.205
Yeah.

40:42.307 --> 40:43.473
So cute.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.208
Ooh.
- Oh!

40:45.310 --> 40:46.543
Thank you, Ma'am.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.812
Oh, thank you.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.613
Delicious.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.749
To a successful baby shower.

40:54.853 --> 40:55.952
Oh, wait, wait, wait, pictures

40:56.054 --> 40:57.887
pictures, pictures.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.722
We're trying to take more
pictures with Sara,

40:59.825 --> 41:03.326
she's, uh,
photographically-challenged.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.595
One in five Americans has it.
- Oh, shoot.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.163
So tragic.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.532
One, two, three.

41:10.702 --> 41:11.868
One more.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.971
Give me
somethin' else.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.073
Bigger... bigger!

41:17.175 --> 41:18.374
Great.

41:21.413 --> 41:22.445
So...

41:22.547 --> 41:24.581
what's the next step for you?

41:24.683 --> 41:27.517
Isn't there a birth plan, or...

41:27.619 --> 41:28.785
That's a thing, right?
Isn't that a thing?

41:28.887 --> 41:30.487
That's a thing.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.188
Um... I'm kinda on the fence.

41:32.290 --> 41:35.325
I'm leaning toward
having a home birth.

41:35.427 --> 41:36.826
Tsk, maybe, uh...

41:36.928 --> 41:38.428
Danny's still kinda nervous.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.033
I talked
to him again last night.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.268
You did?
- Oh...

41:45.370 --> 41:46.503
You were asleep and

41:46.605 --> 41:48.137
I didn't wanna stress you out.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.873
Oh, yeah, right, um...

41:49.975 --> 41:52.008
Danny's still, like,
a little nervous

41:52.110 --> 41:53.943
about the home birth, but, um...

41:54.045 --> 41:55.144
If we had the baby
at the hospital,

41:55.247 --> 41:56.379
would you still be with us?

41:56.481 --> 41:57.547
Of course.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.717
I'll be with you till the end.

42:01.786 --> 42:02.986
So, uh, a home birth,

42:03.088 --> 42:05.555
how does that,
how does that work?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.357
Oh, we have the baby here.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.694
What happens if there's,
like, a problem?

42:11.796 --> 42:15.665
Like bleeding or if the baby
has trouble breathing or...

42:15.767 --> 42:18.167
I-I'm sorry,
I'm just really curious.

42:18.270 --> 42:20.737
I'm trained to deal
with those situations.

42:20.839 --> 42:23.873
Oh, so you're a doctor?
- No.

42:23.975 --> 42:27.043
I'm a licensed
and certified midwife.

42:27.145 --> 42:28.545
But not a doctor?

42:29.314 --> 42:30.813
No.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.248
Women have been
having babies

42:32.350 --> 42:34.083
without hospitals for centuries.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.686
I just, I feel like
it's so important

42:36.788 --> 42:39.088
to be calm and comfortable
in your surroundings.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.658
Yeah. No, that,
that makes total sense.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.027
Again, I'm-I'm totally ignorant
about the whole thing.

42:44.129 --> 42:47.163
I'm sorry to be a bug.
- No!

42:47.265 --> 42:49.198
I'm gonna take these up
to the baby's room.

42:49.301 --> 42:51.734
Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

43:16.528 --> 43:17.961
Hm.

44:05.377 --> 44:07.610
So good.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.846
Sara, I hope I didn't...

44:09.948 --> 44:11.347
I don't know...

44:11.449 --> 44:12.548
hurt your feelings.

44:13.885 --> 44:15.652
What? With Danny? No!

44:15.754 --> 44:18.354
No. No, no, no. No. It's fine.

44:18.456 --> 44:19.989
Absolutely not, no.

44:20.091 --> 44:21.290
So that's a "no"?

44:21.393 --> 44:23.159
Yes!

44:23.261 --> 44:24.327
Sorry, I-I just,
I didn't think

44:24.429 --> 44:25.628
it was a big deal or anything.

44:25.730 --> 44:27.130
I mean, we were just kids.

44:27.232 --> 44:31.100
And, to reiterate, he barfed...
on my shoes.

44:32.404 --> 44:34.704
That's my charmin' man.

44:34.806 --> 44:37.206
And I promise, I shall
reveal each and every

44:37.308 --> 44:38.708
dark secret I can think of.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.109
Okay.

44:40.211 --> 44:42.445
Me too. Um...

44:42.547 --> 44:45.281
Oh, I, uh...

44:46.918 --> 44:48.851
...only put mustard on burgers.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.353
Don't know why.

44:50.455 --> 44:52.355
Well...

44:52.457 --> 44:53.556
I hate muffins.

44:54.492 --> 44:56.626
Monster!

44:56.728 --> 44:59.395
I don't know, maybe because
I'm tired of making them.

44:59.497 --> 45:00.530
I-I mean I like baking.

45:00.632 --> 45:02.899
I like the cafe, but, honestly,

45:03.001 --> 45:04.500
I'm only doin' this
for travel money.

45:04.602 --> 45:07.236
Oh, I love travelling.
Right?

45:07.338 --> 45:09.672
I, I just love being
able to hop on a plane

45:09.774 --> 45:12.542
whenever I want to,
wherever I want.

45:12.644 --> 45:14.243
There've been a lot
of times recently

45:14.345 --> 45:16.145
that I've wanted to
run away from here.

45:16.915 --> 45:18.581
Yeah.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.383
Yeah, I-I know you wanna fit in.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.318
And you will, honestly.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.222
I promise you will find
what's important to you here.

45:26.324 --> 45:29.325
Just don't change
to fit in, huh?

45:30.962 --> 45:33.162
You're right. Thank you.

45:36.301 --> 45:38.000
Oh, thank you so much.

45:38.103 --> 45:39.235
It was awesome,
you're so welcome.

45:39.337 --> 45:41.003
You're so nice!

45:41.106 --> 45:43.706
Well, I am super tired,
so you must be exhausted.

45:43.808 --> 45:46.109
Yes, I'll tell Jina
you said goodnight.

45:46.211 --> 45:48.344
Oh, you don't have to.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.913
Oh, I wished you liked muffins,
you maniac.

45:51.015 --> 45:53.216
What can I say?

45:53.318 --> 45:54.851
Have a good night.
Later.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.482
Jina?

46:26.584 --> 46:28.284
Are you all right?
What're you doing out here?

46:29.888 --> 46:32.889
Is, uh, something wrong
with my gift?

46:33.825 --> 46:35.191
We need to talk.

46:37.796 --> 46:39.462
Yeah, let's do this.

46:46.838 --> 46:48.604
What's your problem with me?

46:48.706 --> 46:51.307
I'm just here to help
Sara and Daniel.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.943
I see your little games.

46:54.045 --> 46:56.078
You have a very
active imagination.

46:56.181 --> 46:58.247
Sara's distracted right now,

46:58.349 --> 47:00.650
but I see you pulling strings.

47:00.752 --> 47:02.618
Okay, I don't know what you want

47:02.720 --> 47:04.520
or what you're tryin' to do.

47:04.622 --> 47:06.389
But I'll figure it out
sooner or later.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.091
That's easy.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.727
I want her baby.

47:15.567 --> 47:17.133
What?

47:17.235 --> 47:18.234
Are you nuts?

47:19.270 --> 47:20.536
No.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.038
No, I'm not.

47:23.441 --> 47:25.942
Just waiting
for the drugs to kick in.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.245
What did you...

47:29.948 --> 47:31.347
Your drink.

47:33.551 --> 47:34.684
Uh...

47:40.458 --> 47:41.958
Uh...

47:42.060 --> 47:44.026
There we go.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.596
Nice and easy.

48:10.255 --> 48:11.921
It was a really
thoughtful gift.

49:47.218 --> 49:49.685
Sara mentioned that you
were on the fence

49:49.787 --> 49:52.288
about the home birth,
I was just...

49:52.390 --> 49:54.190
wondering because we're
kinda getting down

49:54.292 --> 49:55.925
to the wire with the decision.

49:56.027 --> 49:58.227
I'm sorry,
I've just,

49:58.329 --> 50:01.130
I've been so stressed out
with work.

50:01.232 --> 50:03.199
It's fine.

50:03.301 --> 50:04.934
Sara's torn...

50:05.036 --> 50:06.535
I mean, she's really
pro home birth

50:06.637 --> 50:08.804
but she wants to make sure
you're comfortable.

50:08.906 --> 50:12.074
I mean, you really think
we could do this? Here?

50:12.176 --> 50:13.175
I do.

50:14.212 --> 50:16.012
You are amazing.

50:18.149 --> 50:20.950
Uh. Honestly, I, um...

50:21.052 --> 50:23.452
I would do
anything for Sara.

50:23.554 --> 50:24.687
I just want her
to be comfortable.

50:24.789 --> 50:29.592
So, um, I don't know
how women do it.

50:29.694 --> 50:30.960
Good morning.

50:31.062 --> 50:32.828
What are you...
You got your coffee?

50:32.930 --> 50:33.929
I was gonna make it for you.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.632
Yeah, no...
- Oh, it's fine.

50:36.734 --> 50:39.168
You just go rest.
- Okay.

50:39.270 --> 50:40.736
Thank you.

50:40.838 --> 50:43.239
Hey.
- Hey.

50:43.341 --> 50:44.673
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

50:44.776 --> 50:47.410
Yeah, I'm sorry, honey,
I got off late.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.811
I didn't wanna wake you up.

50:48.913 --> 50:50.946
Well, you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

50:51.049 --> 50:53.783
Uh, I gotta pull
some more overtime.

50:53.885 --> 50:55.951
Again? Why?

50:56.054 --> 50:57.753
Well, the guys at the office
just needs me to cover

50:57.855 --> 50:59.922
some stuff for 'em.

51:00.024 --> 51:01.690
Are you hiding something?

51:01.793 --> 51:03.159
What?

51:03.261 --> 51:04.627
No.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.429
Okay.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.330
I love you.
- I love you.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.600
Have a good day, okay?
- Okay.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.536
All right. Bye.
- Mm-hm. Bye.

51:29.987 --> 51:31.053
Hey.

51:31.589 --> 51:32.788
Hey!

51:32.890 --> 51:35.324
Hey, was Danny all right
this morning?

51:35.426 --> 51:36.892
He seems kinda off.

51:36.994 --> 51:39.261
Oh, yeah,
I think he's just tired.

51:40.298 --> 51:41.730
Right. Yeah.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.238
W-what's that?

51:49.340 --> 51:50.873
Allie's number.
- Oh.

51:50.975 --> 51:53.909
You should keep that.
She's great. I really like her.

51:54.011 --> 51:55.611
It was in Danny's pocket.

51:56.747 --> 51:57.880
Hey.

51:57.982 --> 52:00.049
Don't be paranoid.

52:00.151 --> 52:02.751
I know you feel huge
and unattractive right now

52:02.854 --> 52:06.222
but Danny really loves you.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.391
Yeah, I'm... who puts a number
on a napkin anyways.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.729
Listen. Don't even
worry about it.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.764
I mean, when would he
even have time?

52:15.867 --> 52:19.535
He works really late
and he never even eats here.

52:19.637 --> 52:22.938
Yeah, I gotta get groceries
on a bank near the house.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.840
Well, maybe I could make him
something nice.

52:25.776 --> 52:27.176
That'd be nice.

52:46.164 --> 52:47.796
You look lost.

52:47.899 --> 52:49.565
Dr. Collins. Hi!

52:49.667 --> 52:50.900
How are you?
- Good.

52:51.002 --> 52:52.234
Just grabbing some lunch.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.737
How are you feeling?
- Good.

52:54.839 --> 52:57.740
Mm, you sure?
You seem a little upset.

52:57.842 --> 53:00.276
No, sorry,
I'm just distracted. Um...

53:00.378 --> 53:02.378
Oh, I did have some
Braxton Hicks.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.746
But everything is fine now.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.114
How often?

53:05.216 --> 53:07.049
None today.
- Okay.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.251
Well, why don't you
come by my office when you can

53:09.353 --> 53:10.953
and we'll finalize
your birthing plan.

53:11.055 --> 53:13.055
Yeah, I'm actually leaning
toward a home birth.

53:13.157 --> 53:15.324
Jina and I've been
looking at tubs.

53:15.426 --> 53:17.159
Jina?
- My midwife.

53:17.261 --> 53:18.928
Oh, right,
yeah, you mentioned her.

53:19.030 --> 53:21.597
Um, I don't know her.

53:21.699 --> 53:25.100
Really? You said hi to her
when we were at the hospital.

53:25.203 --> 53:27.436
This is the south.
We say hi to everybody.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.438
Plus, I'm super popular
at the hospital.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.773
I bet.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.576
As long as she's
certified and licensed,

53:33.678 --> 53:35.044
just keep me in the loop, okay?

53:35.146 --> 53:36.979
Okay.
- All right?

53:42.386 --> 53:44.253
Hey.
- Hey.

53:44.355 --> 53:46.622
Sorry.
Oh, you finished shopping?

53:46.724 --> 53:48.490
I got caught up
talking to Dr. Collins.

53:48.593 --> 53:50.092
Oh.

53:50.194 --> 53:51.994
It was weird.
He said he doesn't know you.

53:53.798 --> 53:54.997
Typical doctor stuff.

53:55.099 --> 53:56.632
I'm sure if you said,
the cute blonde

53:56.734 --> 53:59.268
with a nice rack,
he'd probably remember.

53:59.370 --> 54:01.370
It's all right.
I'll just call him later.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.373
Did you see Allie there?

54:04.475 --> 54:07.142
No. Um, she's out of town.

54:07.245 --> 54:09.712
That's weird. She didn't
mention that yesterday.

54:10.381 --> 54:11.647
Sorry.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.016
It's fine. She texted.
- Yeah, still.

54:14.118 --> 54:16.852
You shouldn't have someone
flaky in your life right now.

54:16.954 --> 54:18.220
Do you wanna get outta here?

54:18.322 --> 54:19.555
Yeah.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.797
What are you looking for?
- My blue shirt.

54:28.899 --> 54:30.065
It's hanging up.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.667
It's not.
- It is, Danny.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.369
It's not here.

54:33.471 --> 54:34.870
Really?

54:34.972 --> 54:36.305
Well, I'm sorry about it.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.406
You said that
you unpacked it.

54:37.508 --> 54:38.907
I did.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.978
It's in here.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.481
Okay, I, I just can't-can't do
this right now.

54:45.583 --> 54:47.549
I have to study for the bar.

54:47.652 --> 54:48.884
I'm just not gonna have
the time or energy

54:48.986 --> 54:50.185
to do when the baby's here.

54:50.288 --> 54:51.387
You have to
go to this conference.

54:51.489 --> 54:52.921
It's important to you and...

54:53.024 --> 54:55.557
It's overtime.

54:55.660 --> 54:58.394
I just need
a little help here, okay?

54:58.496 --> 55:00.462
Some help. Okay.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.165
What more can I do?

55:03.267 --> 55:04.733
I mean, I'm working
day and night for you.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.437
Well, it's for us.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.407
And I'm all alone here. Okay?

55:11.509 --> 55:13.042
You just pop in
here and there and you

55:13.144 --> 55:14.677
talk to Jina
more than you talk to me.

55:14.779 --> 55:15.911
No, I don't.

55:16.013 --> 55:17.913
You told her
I was feeling cooped up.

55:18.015 --> 55:19.715
I don't remember that

55:19.817 --> 55:22.651
but it's not hard to see
that you're going stir crazy.

55:26.123 --> 55:28.090
I found Allie's number
in your pants.

55:30.127 --> 55:31.660
No, you didn't.

55:33.164 --> 55:35.364
It was on a napkin
in the laundry.

55:35.466 --> 55:37.433
You had a ton of stuff
in the laundry, too.

55:37.535 --> 55:38.634
Maybe it got mixed in
with your stuff.

55:38.736 --> 55:40.369
So you're saying it isn't yours?

55:40.471 --> 55:43.038
Something is wrong here.
I can feel it.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.406
Anyway, who the hell writes

55:44.508 --> 55:45.908
a number on a napkin anyway?

55:46.010 --> 55:47.209
I mean, if I was gonna
get a number,

55:47.311 --> 55:49.144
I would put it in my phone.

55:52.850 --> 55:55.918
Can you just
stop cranking up the heat?

55:56.020 --> 55:57.386
Jeez, like once.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.121
I wake up every night sweating.

55:59.223 --> 56:00.823
Maybe that's because
you might be pregnant.

56:00.925 --> 56:02.925
Oh, wait. You are.

56:03.027 --> 56:04.893
Where are you going?

56:04.995 --> 56:07.196
I'm gonna go cool off.
- Not in this sweat box!

56:29.320 --> 56:30.686
Huh.

56:30.788 --> 56:33.021
You're still awake.

56:33.124 --> 56:34.823
Feeling pretty stressed out.

56:36.861 --> 56:38.727
Hm. Third trimester.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.363
So much going on.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.966
For the mother...

56:44.902 --> 56:47.136
For the dad, too.

56:47.238 --> 56:51.940
I just... feel like
I'm not doing enough.

56:52.042 --> 56:54.543
Have you ever thought
about taking a Lamaze class?

56:58.349 --> 57:01.650
Yeah. I've heard of 'em.
I just...

57:01.752 --> 57:04.286
It could be really helpful,
you know?

57:04.388 --> 57:06.722
They teach you techniques
to help Sara through the labor

57:06.824 --> 57:07.990
and support her.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.995
Okay. Yeah.
I, I can look at my schedule.

57:14.999 --> 57:16.665
You know, I mean,
I could probably

57:16.767 --> 57:18.634
teach you a few things
if you like.

57:18.736 --> 57:20.102
Just get you started,
and then you guys

57:20.204 --> 57:22.070
can practice them together.

57:22.173 --> 57:24.072
It might really help.

57:24.175 --> 57:27.810
Uh, yeah. That could work.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.245
Here.

57:30.347 --> 57:31.713
This is a really good one.

57:33.884 --> 57:35.717
Put your hands here.

57:39.056 --> 57:40.823
Hey, relax.

57:40.925 --> 57:42.324
This is for Sara.

57:44.762 --> 57:46.762
Put your hands lower

57:46.864 --> 57:48.230
and you support her abdomen.

57:50.935 --> 57:52.334
Like this?
Mm-hm.

57:53.437 --> 57:57.206
Now... help her take long...

57:58.843 --> 58:02.511
deep... breaths.

58:06.884 --> 58:09.284
Let your breath...

58:09.386 --> 58:10.786
support hers.

58:18.529 --> 58:20.362
Is this right? I-I...

58:23.934 --> 58:25.367
You're perfect.

58:28.839 --> 58:30.472
Well, uh...

58:32.142 --> 58:33.075
Uh, thanks.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.544
That was really relaxing.

58:36.614 --> 58:39.548
I'm, I'm gonna turn in. Uh...

58:39.650 --> 58:42.551
But thank you for all your help.

58:42.653 --> 58:45.587
Um, I'll talk to Sara
about taking a class together.

58:46.590 --> 58:47.589
Of course.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.226
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

59:05.609 --> 59:07.409
I...

59:07.511 --> 59:08.610
feel...

59:08.712 --> 59:10.512
bad about our fight.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.315
Couples fight.

59:31.468 --> 59:33.769
I feel like

59:33.871 --> 59:37.205
we're on t-two different
islands, you know?

59:37.308 --> 59:39.207
We need to swim back
to each other.

59:40.578 --> 59:42.678
Tell me what you wanna do.

59:42.780 --> 59:44.846
Tell me what you want,
I'll make it happen.

59:48.319 --> 59:52.554
Well, we've, we've already
lost two babies.

59:52.656 --> 59:54.323
I can't go through that again.

59:55.893 --> 59:59.461
I, I know that you're strong.

59:59.563 --> 01:00:02.164
And I know Jina knows
what she's doing.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:05.233
But I'm worried
that if something goes wrong,

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:08.737
I'm gonna be the one
that makes the mistake.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:13.508
And... I've just been
so tired lately that...

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:18.547
I'm, I'm somehow gonna
drop the ball.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.748
Okay.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:26.588
Okay?

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.724
We'll have our baby
at the hospital.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.294
I, I don't wanna make you
do this.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:33.996
You're not.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.531
I could have
a natural birth there.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:38.300
And if it makes you feel better
and more secure,

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:40.369
then it's what I want.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.339
Okay.

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:46.375
We can do a home birth
for the next one.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.479
Deal.

01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:52.447
I promise you...

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:54.716
I will be right there
cheering you on.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:57.519
I know.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.870
Morning.
- Morning.

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:17.739
There's some tea over there.
- Oh.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.141
You haven't been
hydrating enough.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:21.376
I think that's why
you've been so weak.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:22.744
Do you want some oatmeal?

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.579
Sure. That sounds great.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:25.714
Excellent.

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:29.384
So, you must be tired.

01:01:31.622 --> 01:01:33.588
I heard you and Danny
fighting last night.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.426
Um, yeah, it was silly.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:38.927
We're fine now. We made up.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.597
Oh. That's good.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.200
We shared a really
good talk and, um,

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.401
we're gonna have the baby
at the hospital.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:52.107
That's too bad.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:02.484
Well, there's so much
to take in.

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:07.456
I'm glad that you and Danny
examined both possibilities.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:10.392
So, yeah, hospital it is.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:11.526
Perfect.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:14.596
Since you'll be by our side,
I feel like

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:17.499
we can achieve the best of
both worlds, you know?

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.903
Thank you for being
so supportive.

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:23.004
Of course.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.974
Now, go lay down.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:27.876
I'll bring you your oatmeal.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.377
Thanks.

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:04.746
Mm.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.515
I put extra
strawberries in it.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.617
You need
your minerals and fiber.

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:10.018
Thank you so much.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.052
Eat up.

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:12.554
Enjoy.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.759
Mm.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.077
I'm having pain.

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:38.647
In the front,
like before?

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.650
No, in the back, like, deep.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:43.718
That sounds like real
contractions.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.989
It's too soon. Um...

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.058
What do I do?

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.862
Okay. Nice and slow.

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.597
Do you have that tea
you made me earlier?

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.701
After I call Dr. Collins,
I'll get you some.

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:00.869
Okay.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:05.140
There you go. Easy.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.580
Yeah.
Her temperature's fine.

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:13.815
Blood pressure's normal.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.183
They're really far apart

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.719
but they're definitely
real contractions.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.191
Yup. Yup. Oh.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.160
You think so? Oh.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:27.429
Oh, sure. Mm.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:29.931
No, no, no, I totally agree.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.234
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.336
Oh, let's hear it now.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:35.737
Mm-hm. Oh.

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.505
Thank you so much, Doctor.

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:41.610
All right.
Buh-bye now. Thank you.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.185
We're gonna have to keep you
on bed rest.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:53.121
Really?

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.956
But do I have to go in
and see him?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.692
He said I could
just call to check in.

01:04:57.794 --> 01:04:59.527
Hey, this is pretty common.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.964
Well, particularly at this time
and with your history...

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.901
Okay.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.769
I'm not gonna lie.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.205
Bed rest is tough.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.673
But you're tough.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:17.078
We're gonna need to minimize
activity to 15 minutes a day.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.947
Keep you away from stairs.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:22.150
So, we can't have you
collapsing or fainting.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.352
We'll make a plan for showers.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.022
But, apart from that,

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:30.892
you're just gonna have to relax
and try to get some rest.

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.299
I'm coming home.

01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.434
I'm fine. Jina's here.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.836
You're only, what?
Two hours away?

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:43.905
<i>What did
Dr. Collins say?</i>

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:45.840
Jina talked to him
this afternoon.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:50.245
He said right now, I just
need to lie back and relax.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.447
So I'm in my worst nightmare.

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.649
<i>Just... I just hate
leaving you like this.</i>

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.685
Well, it's only a few days.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.353
<i>Almost a week.</i>

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.990
Well, Jina will call
if there's any problems.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:04.626
<i>Okay. Well, I love you.</i>

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.161
I love you, too.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.183
Yes!

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.654
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Kelly, it's Sara.

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:08.056
<i>Oh. Hello.</i>

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.657
Sorry, I missed
the last Mommy Meetup.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.227
I've been sentenced
to bed rest.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:14.729
<i>That must be nice.</i>

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:18.099
Yes. Um...

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.335
I just wanted to say thank you
for coming to my baby shower.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:22.003
And, uh, since I'm on bed rest,

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.339
I thought, maybe I could host
the next Mommy Meetup,

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.808
and everybody could come over,
I'll order food...

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.843
<i>No. We've already
scheduled it.</i>

01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:29.911
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:32.080
Sorry... Kelly, wait.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:34.482
Did I do something
to offend you?

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.351
<i>I don't like
being made a fool of.</i>

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:39.587
<i>And I just can't associate
with someone who lies to me.</i>

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:40.989
Mm, what do you mean "lies"?

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.424
<i>You act
all high and mighty.</i>

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:43.758
<i>Not drinking sweet tea</i>

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.260
<i>or taking medicine,</i>

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:47.695
<i>but then you go out drinking?</i>

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.431
What are you talking about?

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:51.366
<i>I should report you
to child services.</i>

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:53.468
<i>- You're out of control.</i>
- Okay, stop. I...

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.437
Where is this coming from?

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.806
<i>We saw you. All of us.</i>

01:07:57.908 --> 01:07:59.974
Where?
-<i> Online.</i>

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.110
<i>I thought you were too good
for social media.</i>

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:04.279
<i>I can't believe
you posted those pics.</i>

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:06.214
<i>Or are you too drunk
to remember?</i>

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.879
What you doin'?

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:42.716
I was just
looking up breast feeding tips.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.921
You look kinda guilty.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.259
Just didn't want you to think

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.261
I was looking
at pictures of boobs.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:57.165
Well, I actually brought this up

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.533
so you could prop your back up
if you wanted

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.370
but... guess you could use it
to practice.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.104
Right.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.076
Do you need a hat?
No.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:17.585
Thank you so much
for lunch.

01:09:58.261 --> 01:09:59.427
<i>You've reached
the Bassinet.</i>

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:00.461
<i>- How can I help you?</i>
- Hi.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.496
I got a necklace from you guys

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.264
and the clasp just broke.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.666
<i>Oh, so sorry about that.</i>

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.134
<i>We can issue you a refund</i>

01:10:06.236 --> 01:10:07.502
<i>or a replacement.</i>

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.938
Great. It's a silver heart.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.073
Uh, engraved E-H-M.

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:14.943
<i>E-H-M.
And where was it shipped?</i>

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:16.444
Kentucky.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.946
<i>Uh, got it right here.</i>

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:19.147
Um, this was a gift.

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:20.481
So, I don't have the receipt.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:21.616
<i>No problem.</i>

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.585
<i>We can refund to credit card.</i>

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.687
Okay. Uh, Jina Anderson's,
right?

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:28.156
<i>This says
"Laurie Ann Phelps."</i>

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.759
Right. Jina gave me
the diaper bag.

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.294
I'll let Laurie know. Thank you.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.563
<i>Okay,
have a great day.</i>

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:35.256
No. No, no, no. No, no.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:03.651
Danny...

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:12.460
Okay.

01:13:48.158 --> 01:13:49.257
Oh, honey.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.260
I warned you about those stairs.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.541
Oh.

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.576
You're awake.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:09.944
Would you say that
your contractions

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.447
are ten minutes apart
or more like 15?

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.249
Danny's on his way home.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:18.586
Oh, yeah. You really
shouldn't have texted him.

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:20.822
I had plans for him later,
I-I just want to keep this

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:22.890
easy for you,
and now I'm gonna

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.125
have to kill him
in front of you,

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:26.127
which is gonna be really
upsetting and...

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.162
it's just not good
for the baby.

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:32.733
Why are you doing this?

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:35.436
Oh, come on, Sara.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:37.338
I have to do what's right
for the baby.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.240
That's my job.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:42.076
You and Danny
are perfect, physically.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.145
And you're gonna have a strong,
beautiful baby.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:47.682
But emotionally...

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:51.118
you're weak.

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.654
And I'm not gonna let
another strong child

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:55.923
get ruined
by this pathetic world.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.860
Look at me.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:02.797
A world full of people
like you...

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:05.733
who thinks society's supposed
to change for them.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:09.837
That's not how the world works.

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:13.508
The world doesn't
cut you breaks.

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:16.978
Life is tough.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.247
And you have to learn
to take what you need.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.017
I can teach my baby that.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.386
I can.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.693
You're...

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:36.564
"Crazy"? Is that what you said?

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:38.132
Psychotic.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.202
Well, thanks for not
calling me crazy.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:44.872
It's so derogatory for women,
you know?

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:49.911
Actually, uh,
it's pretty misogynistic.

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:51.112
That's a whole other story.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:54.615
I'm gonna get you
some water.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.117
You gotta stay hydrated.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:01.556
Hey, honey!

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:03.090
Did you call the cops?
- What?

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:04.458
Danny!

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:14.268
Yeah. No, no, you stay.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.673
He called me after you texted.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.408
I told him the baby was coming.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:23.210
He was so excited.

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:26.414
You know, I actually thought
about sparing him for a minute.

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.716
I mean, clearly he wants me.

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:31.352
How does that make you feel?

01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:35.189
I thought I'd make a nice,
kind, beautiful midwife.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:39.560
You know, just coming to the aid
of a newly widowed father.

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:43.364
Yeah, but then I figured
it was just better

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:44.832
to wipe the slate clean.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:48.970
Nice murder-suicide

01:16:49.072 --> 01:16:51.973
by a depressed alcoholic
pregnant lady.

01:16:52.075 --> 01:16:54.709
See, you burn the house down
with you in it

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.444
and him and the baby.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.580
It's pretty neat, huh?

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:01.449
I mean, it'll be weeks before
they sift through the ashes

01:17:01.551 --> 01:17:03.217
to see if they find anything.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.191
Oh, she's coming.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.692
I'm gonna get you some towels.

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:20.561
Sara?

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:23.364
Where are you?

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.904
This isn't very responsible.

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:37.712
Sara?

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:47.988
Oh, God, you bitch!

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.325
You're not gonna make it,
city girl.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.730
You're on your own,
I made sure of that.

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:58.399
The mommies group hates you,

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:00.568
Dr. Collins thinks
you don't need him.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.337
And Danny?

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:05.506
Even Danny wasn't sure about you
in the end.

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:08.309
And Allie...

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:11.846
Poor sweet Allie.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.449
You know that little trip
she went on?

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:18.252
Yeah...

01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:20.654
Her car's at the airport.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:23.157
But they'll find her body
in your woods!

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:55.823
Why are you making this
so difficult?

01:19:57.627 --> 01:19:59.026
Sara?

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:14.542
Sara?

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:19.680
Sara,
think about what you're doing.

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.417
You're one of the smartest women
I know.

01:20:25.755 --> 01:20:29.857
A good mother would do <i> anything</i>
for her baby. Anything.

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:33.727
Even sacrifice
her own life.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.338
I would have done <i> anything</i>
for my baby.

01:20:48.778 --> 01:20:50.578
Anything!

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:00.855
How'd you get up there?

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:04.525
She left without you, Danny.

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:07.394
How does that
make you feel?

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:12.099
Wonder if she'll come back
when I do...

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:14.602
this.

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:35.656
Danny?

01:21:37.627 --> 01:21:39.693
What? You're going for your gun?

01:21:39.795 --> 01:21:42.363
Yeah, Sara already told me
about your little toy.

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.999
We're besties.
She tells me everything.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.068
I already tried
for the gun myself.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:50.170
I thought it'd be
a nicer way to go out.

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:52.039
Seemed so peaceful.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:55.242
Now I have to burn this
whole place down.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.344
All because...

01:21:57.446 --> 01:22:00.581
I couldn't get into

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:02.416
your safe!

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.786
Honestly...

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:08.555
you didn't use Sara's birthday
for your code?

01:22:08.658 --> 01:22:10.557
What kind of man does that?

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.793
If I may be so bold...

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.162
indicates problems
for your marriage.

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:18.098
Wait, wait.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.868
I don't have time to wait
but this begging is adorable.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.070
I'm not beggin'.

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:26.140
What?
- I'm gettin' out of the way.

01:22:26.242 --> 01:22:28.575
The combination was our
anniversary, you bitch!

01:23:32.475 --> 01:23:34.274
I'm sorry, honey...

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:37.511
We've lost everything.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:41.048
No, we haven't.

01:23:42.985 --> 01:23:45.319
You were right.

01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:47.321
We have everything
we need right here.

01:23:49.759 --> 01:23:50.824
Come on.

01:23:50.926 --> 01:23:52.659
Let's go meet our baby.

01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:53.761
