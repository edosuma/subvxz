Previously on "Rescue Me"...
What's this?

00:03.893 --> 00:06.752
That, my dear nephew, is a
rare bottle of Irish whiskey.

00:07.225 --> 00:09.633
Little somethin' to wish you
well on your first day back.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.186
What gives?

00:11.306 --> 00:14.291
- We've come to the conclusion...
- That you're a lost cause,

00:14.340 --> 00:15.852
and now we gotta cut you loose.

00:16.373 --> 00:17.668
You got a great family, Tom.

00:17.735 --> 00:21.271
Look, I gotta tell you, bro,
these kids, they need a dad.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.131
Ah, yeah. Yeah.

00:23.409 --> 00:25.539
Well, come on, asshole,
do something about it then.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.071
I think you're drinking too much.

00:27.191 --> 00:29.360
I'm tryin' to explain
somethin' to you here.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.514
Let's get a drink.

00:30.582 --> 00:31.700
I get what you're tryin' to do here.

00:31.752 --> 00:33.858
The tough love, it's old school.
It's admirable.

00:34.519 --> 00:36.908
I eat when I'm up.
I eat when I'm down.

00:37.028 --> 00:39.024
Sounds like you're gonna
eat yourself to death.

00:39.144 --> 00:40.584
I think that's kinda the point.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.997
Jesus Christ.

00:45.117 --> 00:46.296
Janet, I am so sorry.

00:46.364 --> 00:49.909
Seriously, stop beating yourself up.
Ok? It's...Look, nothing happened.

00:49.966 --> 00:50.886
Hey.

00:51.331 --> 00:52.306
Hey.

00:52.426 --> 00:53.623
What are you doing here?

00:58.443 --> 01:02.649
You two have got to be shitting me.

01:24.002 --> 01:25.670
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

01:26.237 --> 01:28.504
Well, well.
The prodigal bum returns.

01:28.624 --> 01:30.620
- Yep.
- What's the matter?

01:31.709 --> 01:32.949
What are you doing?

01:36.347 --> 01:40.106
You know, you're, uh, supposed to treat
the, uh, customers with a little honor

01:40.226 --> 01:44.355
and, uh, you know, nice.

01:45.223 --> 01:47.491
That's a tall order in this
place, the pricks I gotta deal with,

01:47.558 --> 01:49.716
present company
most definitely included.

01:49.836 --> 01:50.861
Mm-hmm.

01:50.928 --> 01:53.688
All right, strike one, dipshit.
You don't bring your own bottle into a bar.

01:53.808 --> 01:55.734
Strike 2, no smokin'.

01:55.854 --> 01:56.950
Look, my name is on the lease now.

01:57.070 --> 01:59.233
We are playin' by the rules of the great
city and the state of New York.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.334
So if you wanna drink that,
smoke that, take it outside.

02:04.242 --> 02:07.176
All right. I'll take it outside.

02:07.236 --> 02:09.390
Why don't you come outside
with me, pussy?

02:09.681 --> 02:11.813
- Faggot.
- Douche bag.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.442
- Shit prick.
- Dickweed.

02:13.562 --> 02:14.904
- Nut sack.
- Numbnuts.

02:15.024 --> 02:15.836
'Mo.

02:16.521 --> 02:20.090
"'Mo." Heh heh heh.

02:20.210 --> 02:22.275
Unbelievable.

02:22.395 --> 02:23.990
Hey. Hey!

02:24.037 --> 02:25.040
- What?
- Where you goin'?

02:25.160 --> 02:28.243
I'm goin' to the, uh, little
girls' room, queer bait.

02:29.078 --> 02:30.512
Ass face.

02:34.186 --> 02:35.383
Mmm.

02:40.882 --> 02:43.837
Great state of New York my balls.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.289
Tell me.

03:00.631 --> 03:02.901
This is your choice?

03:06.994 --> 03:10.209
Great. Oh, boy.

03:12.186 --> 03:13.801
Just great.

03:14.177 --> 03:16.085
You almost bite it, but no.

03:17.171 --> 03:20.047
God decides you get another chance.

03:20.911 --> 03:22.846
Yeah. Wasn't your time.

03:23.723 --> 03:26.939
And this... Tommy, this is
what you do with it?

03:27.398 --> 03:28.665
It's pathetic.

03:29.263 --> 03:32.146
Broken record, pal.

03:32.744 --> 03:35.334
If it had been me walkin' out
of those towers alive,

03:35.454 --> 03:39.684
you can bet you wouldn't find my
drunken, pathetic Irish ass

03:40.053 --> 03:41.376
in some backroom.

03:41.496 --> 03:42.503
Great.

03:42.774 --> 03:46.874
Huh? I'd be singin' and
dancin' in the street.

03:47.311 --> 03:50.176
But to you... life is piss to you.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.582
Life is nothin' but piss.

03:53.531 --> 03:55.352
Hey, you're dead, OK?

03:55.419 --> 03:58.709
You know, you're... you're
not even here, all right?

04:00.591 --> 04:03.032
- Tommy, that may be...
- Bullshit.

04:04.262 --> 04:05.858
But I'm a goddamn hero.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.416
Ok, get up.

04:23.548 --> 04:25.019
You're the hero? Huh?

04:25.139 --> 04:28.137
How about all the times I pulled
your ass out of shit? Huh? Huh?

04:28.257 --> 04:29.696
Who was the hero then, asshole?

04:30.087 --> 04:33.256
Huh? Christ almighty, half the
medals you had on your chest

04:33.324 --> 04:35.276
were because I didn't want...
goddamn want 'em!

04:35.838 --> 04:37.536
It's over, hero!

04:39.206 --> 04:42.060
The one time I take my goddamn
eyes off you, you wander off,

04:42.180 --> 04:46.109
ends up bein' the biggest goddamn tragedy
in the history of the fire service, huh?

04:46.130 --> 04:48.284
And you're the hero, and I'm the
goddamn goat?

04:51.348 --> 04:54.285
I'm glad you're dead. I'm glad you're
dead, and I'm glad I'm alive.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.711
Stop it. What are you doing?

04:55.947 --> 04:57.604
Jesus Christ.

04:57.952 --> 04:59.456
Oh my God.

05:01.196 --> 05:03.105
How many times did I tell you

05:03.481 --> 05:05.838
not to ride your goddamn bike
in the street?

05:05.958 --> 05:07.224
- No, you didn't tell me that day.
- Yes, I did.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.024
I said it about 50 goddamn times.

05:09.144 --> 05:10.720
I just wanted to show
you my wheelie, dad.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.059
- You couldn't do a goddamn wheelie.
Lifting your own...- Yes, I could.

05:13.087 --> 05:14.865
Lifting your front tire of
your bike half an inch off the

05:14.932 --> 05:15.989
- ground is not a goddamn wheelie.
- That's a wheelie.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.765
- Stop usin' that whiny voice.
- Mom said it was cool.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.104
Mom? Mom this. Mom that.

05:20.224 --> 05:23.808
I'm sick of "mom." I knew you were
gonna be a pussy.

05:24.087 --> 05:28.282
I knew it. You ruined things between me
and your mother. You know that, right?

05:28.616 --> 05:30.530
Huh? You happy now?

05:30.795 --> 05:32.382
Hmm? Happy?

â™ª On another day, c'mon, c'mon,
with these ropes tied tight,

05:46.664 --> 05:51.568
can we do no wrong, now we
grieve 'cause now is gone,

05:51.569 --> 05:56.072
things were good when we were
young, when my teeth bite down,

05:56.140 --> 06:00.977
I can see the blood of a thousand
men who have come and gone,

06:01.045 --> 06:06.016
now we grieve 'cause now
is gone, things were good

06:06.083 --> 06:09.219
when we were young, is it safe to say?

06:09.287 --> 06:12.422
C'mon, c'mon was it right to leave?

06:12.490 --> 06:15.792
C'mon, c'mon will I ever learn?

06:15.860 --> 06:21.097
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon â™ª

06:29.735 --> 06:31.336
Hey. He still in there?

06:31.456 --> 06:33.243
Yeah. Goin' strong.

06:33.682 --> 06:35.516
- You said he came in with a bottle.
- Yeah.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.445
Whiskey. Good stuff.

06:37.786 --> 06:39.244
How much of it was gone?

06:40.023 --> 06:42.671
- Close to half,
- Pff, and he's still moving around.

06:42.791 --> 06:43.820
That's impressive.

06:45.068 --> 06:47.002
You know, God only knows what
he's been up to.

06:47.122 --> 06:48.854
One of his hands is all bloody.

06:49.853 --> 06:52.443
Hey, listen. Take this.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.068
Buy him a couple more rounds.

06:54.136 --> 06:55.245
What, you're kidding me, right?

06:55.365 --> 06:57.619
No, no. Nail in the coffin, in
case the bottle doesn't work.

06:57.739 --> 06:59.822
You know, and then just, you
know, let him sleep it off.

06:59.942 --> 07:01.295
- All right.
- All right?

07:04.102 --> 07:05.430
Oh.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.298
Mmm. Yeah.

07:09.418 --> 07:10.662
Dad.

07:11.177 --> 07:12.452
Coll. What's up?

07:13.050 --> 07:15.076
Are you OK?
You sound kinda sick.

07:16.608 --> 07:18.007
I'm fine.

07:20.666 --> 07:26.429
Fine. Just sick of a lot of assholes.
That's what I'm sick of.

07:26.693 --> 07:29.753
But I'm not sick of you.
You know what?

07:30.185 --> 07:33.120
Glad you called. I wanted to tell you
I love you.

07:33.607 --> 07:35.918
OK? And I know I don't say that
often enough, but I'm sayin' it now.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.574
I love you. And I'll tell you
somethin' else.

07:37.694 --> 07:41.782
You know somethin' else? You know,
parents aren't supposed to say this

07:41.902 --> 07:43.132
but I'm gonna say it.

07:43.252 --> 07:45.849
You're my favorite.
You're not supposed to have a favorite kid.

07:45.969 --> 07:47.520
Parents aren't supposed to pick a kid,

07:47.640 --> 07:49.411
but you were always my favorite.
 And you know what?

07:49.445 --> 07:53.722
I'll tell you why.
Because you don't take any... you got balls.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.822
And you don't take any shit off anybody,

07:55.942 --> 07:59.103
and you never took no shit took
no shit off nobody, and I...you know,

07:59.395 --> 08:00.760
that's why I love you.

08:01.762 --> 08:03.452
What's goin' on?
What are you doin'?

08:03.572 --> 08:07.088
Uh, um, could you come pick me up?

08:07.208 --> 08:08.396
Yeah.

08:09.761 --> 08:11.385
Let me tell you somethin'. Ahem.

08:11.621 --> 08:16.291
- You are smart and gorgeous, obviously.
And funny. - I know.

08:16.411 --> 08:18.688
And you have a great attitude,
and don't let that... Don't change that.

08:18.711 --> 08:20.604
That's gotta... that's gotta stay.
That's a keeper.

08:21.923 --> 08:23.389
Smile.

08:23.509 --> 08:24.266
What are you doin'?

08:24.386 --> 08:25.825
I'm putting this on Youtube.

08:25.945 --> 08:27.245
When dads drive drunk.

08:27.365 --> 08:29.397
I'm not drunk. Lookit.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.819
If I was drunk, could I do this?

08:31.939 --> 08:34.107
- Lookit. - Dad, put your hands
on the wheel. Don't do that.

08:34.150 --> 08:35.054
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

08:35.107 --> 08:35.616
I do this all the time.

08:35.652 --> 08:38.505
No, you don't, not when I'm in the car.
Don't do that when I'm in the car.

08:38.573 --> 08:40.140
I could make a sport out of it.
I could win a gold medal. Here.

08:40.207 --> 08:41.408
Let me tell you somethin' else.

08:42.576 --> 08:45.970
That's the thing with
your mother, you know.

08:46.090 --> 08:51.086
She was a blast. And then, out of
nowhere, she sucks.

08:51.350 --> 08:54.689
- Now she's just a big pain in my balls.
- No shit.

08:54.739 --> 08:57.544
You know, if I had a pair of balls,

08:57.808 --> 09:01.024
there would be a giant pain in them
and it would be her.

09:03.268 --> 09:04.661
Did I say you were funny?

09:04.781 --> 09:05.913
Mmm.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.578
- You OK with this?
- Hell yeah.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.932
You heard what she said.
We can drink for free.

09:11.052 --> 09:13.256
I know. And you have to... you
have to learn how you can...

09:13.376 --> 09:15.108
- I know.
- Adapt. You know what I mean?

09:15.228 --> 09:17.478
- Flex... be flexible. Flexible.
- Hell, yeah.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.455
Don't tell Shawn
about this, because he'd get...

09:22.575 --> 09:24.888
- I'm not gonna... honey, no way.
Why would I tell Sha... - Way freaked out.

09:25.186 --> 09:29.290
Listen, I don't care about his disapproval.
You shouldn't care about his... Right?

09:29.410 --> 09:30.685
- Totally.
- You know what I mean?

09:31.175 --> 09:32.288
Don't tell your mother.

09:32.408 --> 09:35.362
- Ok.
- Ok? This is just our... no. No.

09:35.430 --> 09:36.975
Ok. So...
You guys ready to roll?

09:36.996 --> 09:38.167
- Yeah.
- Yeah. To me.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.834
Could you just pull over? You're drivin' me
crazy. I wanna get out of the car.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.172
I'm the responsible one. I get to decide
who does what, when, how.

09:46.225 --> 09:47.928
My truck. My rules.

09:48.048 --> 09:48.971
My night.

09:49.091 --> 09:50.244
Give me my phone back.

09:50.312 --> 09:51.866
No. No. The phone is mine.

09:51.986 --> 09:52.980
No, give me my phone back.

09:53.048 --> 09:54.782
No, I'm not givin' you the phone back.
No, you want it, come and get it.

09:54.849 --> 09:57.117
Come and get the... Aah!

09:59.676 --> 10:01.421
Get back here.

10:03.259 --> 10:04.108
All right.

10:04.414 --> 10:07.172
I'm gonna count to 3. 1...

10:09.018 --> 10:10.784
I hear you.

10:11.730 --> 10:12.877
- Oh.
- Hey.

10:15.912 --> 10:17.012
Ohh!

10:17.132 --> 10:18.013
It's OK. Tom.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.506
What are you doin' here?

10:19.574 --> 10:22.234
- I love... Oh!
- Ohh!

10:23.320 --> 10:24.837
What stinks like mint?

10:24.863 --> 10:26.524
- What?
- What stinks like mint?!

10:26.581 --> 10:28.652
I'm... I'm minty.

10:28.930 --> 10:32.341
I am gonna just... ooh.

10:32.461 --> 10:34.179
Shit. I'm gonna...

10:34.299 --> 10:38.205
Ok, Mr. Minty, Tommy, come on.
You gotta go.

10:38.325 --> 10:39.812
Yeah. Just I'm...

10:39.834 --> 10:42.105
No, no, no, no. Whatever you do, keep your pants on.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.560
Don't lay down on the bed.
Ok, don't unzip your pants.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.831
Hey. Hey.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.448
I... I don't have school tomorrow.

10:49.568 --> 10:52.163
School. Tommy, come on.

10:52.283 --> 10:54.946
You gotta pick it up,
get it together. Ohh.

11:00.997 --> 11:04.811
Jimmy! 'S night.

11:08.862 --> 11:09.684
Is he out?

11:11.438 --> 11:12.994
Yes. I think he's out.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.560
What is that, nyquil?

11:53.011 --> 11:57.377
J-Janet? Katy?

12:25.110 --> 12:28.955
God.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.864
Shit.

12:34.819 --> 12:37.727
Oh, sh...

12:40.425 --> 12:42.168
Oh, goddamn it.

12:45.163 --> 12:46.063
Yeah.

12:46.131 --> 12:47.250
Where the hell are you?

12:49.134 --> 12:51.456
- Franco. I'm, uh...
- Where are you?

12:52.528 --> 12:55.187
I.. I'm home...
We're not working today, right?

12:55.307 --> 12:56.287
Where's Colleen?

12:57.331 --> 12:58.635
How the hell should I know?

12:58.943 --> 13:01.141
Get your ass down here now!

13:01.531 --> 13:03.562
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom. You know what?

13:03.682 --> 13:06.116
Next time you put your hands on
her, I swear to God I will...

13:07.519 --> 13:08.419
I'm not jokin'!

13:08.486 --> 13:09.186
What's going on?

13:09.254 --> 13:11.495
- Understand?! She's done bein'
the punchin' bag, asshole! - What?

13:11.537 --> 13:13.369
The next time you wanna get
in a fight, you come find me.

13:13.391 --> 13:15.125
- You come find a man...
- What are you talking about?

13:15.193 --> 13:16.627
- Instead of a woman.
- What, man? What? What?

13:16.695 --> 13:18.429
Oh, so you didn't go over
there after I left last night

13:18.496 --> 13:19.890
and start tearin' the place apart
like some kind of lunatic?

13:20.010 --> 13:20.906
Over where?
What are you talkin' about?

13:21.026 --> 13:23.927
Janet's house! I mean, come on, Tom!
How much of a dick are you?

13:24.047 --> 13:25.549
You know how much you
terrorized them?! They went, and

13:25.598 --> 13:27.500
they spent the night at Janet's
cousin's house in Jersey!

13:27.620 --> 13:30.074
- How do you feel about that?!
- All right, all right, break it up!

13:30.141 --> 13:30.808
Back it up.

13:30.875 --> 13:34.284
Break it up! Go to your neutral corner.
We got bigger fish to fry.

13:34.674 --> 13:37.381
Tommy, I been calling you all morning.
Where is Colleen?

13:37.449 --> 13:39.560
- I don't know. - But you were with her
last night, right?

13:39.838 --> 13:40.851
No.

13:40.919 --> 13:43.472
No-nobody's heard from Colleen
since around 10:00 last night.

13:43.592 --> 13:44.564
Yeah?

13:44.684 --> 13:46.820
Ok. She went out with somebody
around 8:30.

13:46.940 --> 13:50.509
She didn't say who. Then Janet called her
around, what, 10:00,

13:50.629 --> 13:53.001
and she said you were comin' to pick her up.
Now, where is she, Tommy?

13:53.631 --> 13:54.811
Where is she?!

13:56.301 --> 13:57.491
I don't know.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.276
Hey, hey.

14:00.512 --> 14:03.874
Listen, I just... I just got up, guys. I just...
I haven't even had coffee yet. Let me..

14:04.250 --> 14:08.171
Let me take a piss and, uh, straighten
myself out a little bit.

14:08.513 --> 14:10.217
Yeah. Go wake up, Tom.

14:10.337 --> 14:11.281
Have a drink!

14:11.349 --> 14:12.662
- All right, all right.
- Come on. - You dick.

14:13.885 --> 14:15.088
Come on. Grab a seat.

14:34.105 --> 14:35.806
Oh, my g...

14:51.256 --> 14:53.757
God. Ehh.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.108
So you don't remember pickin' her up?

15:08.588 --> 15:09.924
You remember her calling you?

15:12.919 --> 15:15.105
Um... is there a message
from her on your phone?

15:29.663 --> 15:31.431
Oh. Earrings. Lovely.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.812
- Well, are they Colleen's?
- No. Those are clip-ons.

15:33.932 --> 15:34.832
She hates clip-ons.

15:35.089 --> 15:37.899
Yeah, I spent some time in my
uncle's jewelry store when I was a kid.

15:38.019 --> 15:39.277
These diamonds are real.

15:39.604 --> 15:40.975
Well, they could be his, you know?

15:41.095 --> 15:43.021
Maybe he got so drunk last night,
he put 'em on and

15:43.299 --> 15:46.176
a nice dress, maybe, uh, a little wig,

15:46.211 --> 15:48.659
some ladies' underwear and went
out on the town.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.151
It happens.

15:52.317 --> 15:54.139
No. No messages from Colleen.

15:54.181 --> 15:56.905
Well, what exactly do you
remember about last night?

15:58.898 --> 16:01.358
Mm, I remember plenty of stuff.

16:01.478 --> 16:04.127
Listen, let's just stay focused
on Colleen, all right?

16:04.195 --> 16:05.218
I've called her a hundred times.

16:05.338 --> 16:08.098
Her moms has been callin' her
all mornin', and nothin', nada,

16:08.166 --> 16:09.500
man. She's off the grid, son.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.287
Uh-huh. Well, maybe she
doesn't wanna talk to you.

16:11.322 --> 16:12.513
Maybe she wants to
talk to her old man.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.944
That's... that's Colleen's phone.
That's her ring for you.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.217
Why... why do I get a barkin' dog?

16:27.285 --> 16:28.986
Yeah. Why not an Irish jig?

16:29.053 --> 16:30.652
Yeah, or a drunk pukin'
his guts out?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.963
Colleen liked to take
pictures on this thing.

16:33.504 --> 16:36.927
Girl gets a few drinks in her, she thinks
she's goddamn Annie Leibovitz.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.129
Annie Leibovitz?

16:39.507 --> 16:41.431
Boo-yah. Do I know my lady?

16:41.499 --> 16:43.112
Tons of new flicks from
last night right here.

16:43.232 --> 16:44.017
What do we got?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.576
All right, let me start
from the beginning.

16:46.537 --> 16:47.738
Ohh!

16:47.805 --> 16:48.672
What?

16:48.740 --> 16:50.541
- That's my new Christmas card.
- Listen.

16:50.608 --> 16:52.776
- I don't wanna see that.
- No, no. It was not my idea.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.912
She wanted to do a little
boudoir photography.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.713
Yeah, it looks like a
little booty photography.

16:56.781 --> 16:59.283
Yeah, your ass looks kinda ashy.

16:59.515 --> 17:01.747
Yeah, you might wanna do some
squats, brother, tighten that shit up.

17:01.797 --> 17:04.681
Listen, my ass is tight enough, all right?
I wouldn't talk about ashy, peewee.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.391
I moisturize twice a day.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.815
All right, just turn it off.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.410
- Give...
- Oh, now this is charming.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.685
You might wanna get this blown up
for the next AA father-daughter night.

17:18.102 --> 17:19.670
Uh-oh. I hit somethin'.

17:19.737 --> 17:20.704
Wait a minute.

17:20.771 --> 17:21.934
What?

17:24.829 --> 17:26.932
Tommy, who is this?

17:30.873 --> 17:33.128
Uh, I don't know.

17:36.020 --> 17:40.721
Well, this may help.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.829
Hair of the dog.
Maybe, uh,

17:44.108 --> 17:46.961
knock somethin' loose up there,
get the gears goin' again.

17:50.268 --> 17:54.297
I don't know, Lou. I mean,
just the smell of that alone is...

17:54.417 --> 17:55.759
I don't know if I can get it down.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.613
Jesus Christ, you're a prize, Tom.

17:58.003 --> 18:00.495
The sheer volume of booze
you have tossed past your teeth

18:00.520 --> 18:02.673
for no good goddamn reason
all these years, and now,

18:02.793 --> 18:05.959
now that it might actually do some good,
now you loose your... your thirst. Seriously?

18:07.658 --> 18:08.884
All right.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.932
Ahh.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.949
All right, good. Empty your pockets.
Let's see what we got.

18:25.069 --> 18:27.871
I mean, so far, we got the earrings.
We got the cell phone.

18:27.939 --> 18:31.173
We got a napkin, a lighter.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.444
What else?

18:34.512 --> 18:39.931
"Alice 501 CPW"
That's, uh, Central Park West.

18:40.051 --> 18:41.885
Dash it, Holmes.
You've done it again.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.307
Aw, thanks, Homes.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.809
Ok. Who's Alice?

18:48.660 --> 18:49.703
I don't know.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.209
Henderson's.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.757
Alice Henderson.
I know an Alice Henderson.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.271
Her... No, that was a Henry Anderson.

19:00.405 --> 19:04.010
No, it was, uh, Henry Aaron, actually.
Hank Aaron.

19:04.130 --> 19:07.017
I don't really know him at all. I don't
know what the hell I'm talkin' about. Sorry.

19:10.668 --> 19:14.301
It was the sign.
It was the name on a... on a sign at a bar.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.345
Ok, there's a bar.

19:15.653 --> 19:16.598
There's a bar.

19:16.718 --> 19:20.197
Ok. Ok, thank you, hair of the dog.
You keep drinkin'.

19:20.234 --> 19:22.459
Anybody got a phone with,
uh, Internet on it?

19:22.527 --> 19:23.638
Yeah. I'm already on it.

19:23.928 --> 19:27.562
Ok, bars named Henderson's
in the greater New York City area.

19:27.910 --> 19:29.023
I got 6.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.524
3 in Manhattan, one in Queens,
one in Staten Island,

19:37.562 --> 19:39.557
and one in Jersey City.
Any of those ring a bell, Tom?

19:40.448 --> 19:43.211
- No.
- You got a picture of Colleen?

19:43.444 --> 19:47.557
I got a picture from...
 I don't have my wallet.

19:47.677 --> 19:50.006
Ah, Jesus. Listen.
I have pictures of her upstairs.

19:50.126 --> 19:52.303
All right, bring one down to Mike and Sean.

19:52.423 --> 19:54.614
Franco, you write down
the addresses of these 6 places.

19:54.734 --> 19:57.106
You give it to these guys.
You guys go to these places.

19:57.226 --> 20:00.945
You check 'em out. You see any sign
of Colleen at all, you call us with the 411.

20:01.065 --> 20:03.767
Black Shawn, you stay here just
in case she shows up, all right?

20:03.835 --> 20:05.469
And moisturize your ass.

20:05.536 --> 20:08.288
Rest of you guys, let's go.

20:14.445 --> 20:17.795
Well, it looks like you been hangin' out
with a higher class of broad.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.415
Too bad you can't remember.

20:23.588 --> 20:26.091
Get outta here!

20:26.824 --> 20:27.970
Well, that doesn't look good.

20:28.304 --> 20:31.611
2,900 bucks, and that's
just for the glass.

20:32.230 --> 20:35.504
Yeah, well, we're lookin'
for a woman named Alice, 13H.

20:35.624 --> 20:37.100
You and everybody else.

20:37.168 --> 20:39.112
Building management's been
tryin' to call her all morning.

20:39.164 --> 20:40.105
They want her to pay for this.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.446
She broke the window?

20:41.566 --> 20:44.481
Check it out. She gets some
asshole up to her place last night,

20:44.601 --> 20:46.042
night, both drunk as skunks.

20:46.577 --> 20:50.035
Is only up there maybe an hour,
comes down, pukes his guts out

20:50.155 --> 20:52.549
in a planter in the
lobby, and it's green.

20:52.617 --> 20:53.483
The planter?

20:53.551 --> 20:55.474
The puke. Green.

20:56.448 --> 20:59.483
Doorman goes to grab this asshole.
They tussle a little bit.

21:00.054 --> 21:02.679
Before you know it, poor Tony
comes flyin' through the window,

21:02.799 --> 21:05.895
and Tony is not a young guy.
Uh, excuse me a second.

21:07.465 --> 21:11.357
Any chance, uh, you're the
asshole in that, uh, story?

21:11.669 --> 21:14.037
You! You! It's him!

21:14.105 --> 21:15.505
It's the green-puking asshole!

21:15.573 --> 21:17.277
- It's him?
- Go get him! Police!

21:17.397 --> 21:19.403
- Hey! Hey!
- Police! Police!

21:23.799 --> 21:24.746
No.

21:25.665 --> 21:28.045
I was here all last night and
never saw her.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.785
And I've got a pornographic memory
when it comes to chicks.

21:32.537 --> 21:33.776
You mean photographic?

21:34.431 --> 21:37.160
Hey, you got your memory.
I got mine.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.911
What are you guys, cops?

21:38.979 --> 21:40.323
No. Firefighters.

21:40.443 --> 21:43.260
Jeez, why don't you say so?
Sit down. Have a pop on the house.

21:43.380 --> 21:44.250
- Thanks.
- Sweet.

21:44.317 --> 21:46.452
- Thank you, man.
- Hey, guys, we're kinda busy, remember?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.053
That's right.
We do have 5 more bars to get to.

21:48.121 --> 21:49.588
Ahem.
It's on the house, dudes.

21:50.115 --> 21:50.630
Good point.

21:50.701 --> 21:52.051
Yeah. All right, we'll make
it a short one. Yeah?

21:52.171 --> 21:54.446
Or a regular one and
we drink it fast, bro.

21:54.756 --> 21:57.574
Another good point. You're 2 for 2, bro.
Here you go. Damian.

21:57.694 --> 21:58.564
- What?
- You hold these.

21:58.632 --> 21:59.923
You will be the D.D.

22:00.043 --> 22:01.267
What's that?

22:01.921 --> 22:06.083
The designated...
Hitter.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.510
Hey.

22:11.578 --> 22:13.998
- Yeah, so what... is this the new chapter?
- What?

22:14.118 --> 22:16.248
Huh? The new Tommy that
loves his family so much?!

22:17.684 --> 22:21.187
Where is she?! So help me, God,
if something happened to her!

22:21.254 --> 22:22.521
Hey, hey.

22:22.589 --> 22:24.657
- Janet, stop. This isn't gonna help.
- Leave her alone. Leave her alone.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.225
Hey, look, man. I'm tryin'
to help you out, all right?

22:26.293 --> 22:27.259
Had to be Franco, huh?

22:27.327 --> 22:29.028
You... do you really hate me that much?

22:29.658 --> 22:31.557
All right, I... I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

22:31.677 --> 22:32.747
Oh, you know what you said.

22:32.867 --> 22:34.210
What? What did I say?

22:34.330 --> 22:36.869
Oh, goddamn it.
You... let me tell you somethin',

22:36.937 --> 22:40.573
OK? If I find out that you slept
with him, then you won't see

22:40.640 --> 22:41.540
those kids again, OK?

22:41.608 --> 22:43.642
You know what you goddamn said, Tommy!

22:43.710 --> 22:44.643
Janet. Janet. Janet. Janet.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.945
Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.

22:46.012 --> 22:49.481
Come on. That's enough.
Let's go in the back and calm down.

23:10.496 --> 23:11.541
How's it goin', boss?

23:12.487 --> 23:13.476
Not so good.

23:13.596 --> 23:14.540
No word yet, huh?

23:15.234 --> 23:16.208
Nope.

23:20.914 --> 23:22.905
Is he out?

23:24.213 --> 23:25.666
You at Sheila's last night?

23:27.127 --> 23:28.116
Why would I be at Sheila's?

23:28.236 --> 23:29.049
I don't know.

23:31.165 --> 23:32.487
Were you at Sheila's last night?

23:33.147 --> 23:36.112
I don't know, but for some
strange reason,

23:36.930 --> 23:39.064
I seem to remember you bein'
at Sheila's last night.

23:39.428 --> 23:41.865
Why don't we solve one mystery
at a time, huh, Scooby?

23:44.588 --> 23:46.899
Hey, kid, I just want you to know

23:47.205 --> 23:49.908
I would have never called her to meet up
with me had I known this was gonna happen.

23:50.634 --> 23:52.820
What do you mean?
What... we been gettin' together.

23:53.056 --> 23:56.312
I been talkin' to her, tryin' to straighten
her out on the drinkin' thing.

23:56.432 --> 23:57.968
We're havin' a good time.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.953
She says she's gotta use the can.
She splits on me.

24:01.566 --> 24:05.499
So I call Jan, and Jan calls Colleen,
and Colleen said you were pickin' her up.

24:05.619 --> 24:06.433
I was.

24:07.505 --> 24:10.963
Tom, did Colleen get into
that bottle that we gave you?

24:11.031 --> 24:12.031
What bottle?

24:12.822 --> 24:15.439
The fancy bottle of whiskey we
gave you as a farewell gift.

24:17.346 --> 24:20.501
We know you got into it, but we just kinda
need to know if Colleen got into it.

24:22.213 --> 24:23.411
Why? What's the big deal?

24:24.403 --> 24:28.886
Listen, I know we were at the bar, Eddie said
that you got into it and it was half full.

24:30.129 --> 24:31.159
So what?

24:34.347 --> 24:35.280
What?

24:36.956 --> 24:39.211
It's... goddamn it.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.461
We laced the bottle.

24:42.529 --> 24:43.762
What?

24:44.192 --> 24:45.904
We laced the bottle.

24:46.433 --> 24:48.123
Jesus Christ.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.519
Uh, it was a last-ditch effort, honey,

24:51.639 --> 24:52.911
to get him to stop.

24:53.538 --> 24:56.049
You really think we'd walk
away without tryin' everything?

24:56.667 --> 25:00.189
You're our family, Tom, our own
flesh and blood. We love you.

25:01.525 --> 25:04.610
Yeah, you love me. Yeah.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.174
You loved me enough to poison me.

25:09.483 --> 25:10.597
Pretty much.

25:15.695 --> 25:19.264
Stop it! Stop it!
You... break it up! Enough!

25:20.418 --> 25:21.533
Both of you, stop it.

25:21.601 --> 25:23.246
Stop it!

25:24.070 --> 25:27.109
Damn it, Tommy, it was gonna
come to this sooner or later,

25:27.416 --> 25:30.169
OK? It didn't matter if you did
it or somebody else gave you a push.

25:30.221 --> 25:32.802
You were gonna end up dead.
Ok, this is it, Tommy.

25:33.113 --> 25:35.047
You have finally hit rock bottom.

25:35.556 --> 25:38.270
And maybe you can't see it,
but they did a good thing.

25:38.556 --> 25:39.391
We did.

25:40.220 --> 25:40.819
Ow!

25:40.887 --> 25:42.546
You goddamn idiots.

25:42.853 --> 25:45.400
Well, you did a good thing for him, but
did you stop and think about somebody else

25:45.450 --> 25:48.113
getting into that bottle?
Your niece, for example.

25:48.335 --> 25:49.360
Never came into our heads.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.596
You gotta believe me.
I mean, look at him.

25:50.961 --> 25:52.074
Look at him. It's him.

25:52.194 --> 25:54.379
Tommy Gavin, you give him
a bottle of top-shelf Irish whiskey,

25:54.413 --> 25:57.180
the last thing... you gotta believe... we thought
he was gonna do was share with anybody.

25:57.753 --> 25:59.927
To be honest, the only dangerous
thing we thought about

25:59.963 --> 26:03.033
was findin' him with his head stuck in the
bottle tryin' to suck out the last drop.

26:05.552 --> 26:09.279
So my little girl is out
there sick somewhere.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.685
We'll find her, honey.

26:11.084 --> 26:12.257
Don't... don't worry, Janet.

26:12.377 --> 26:14.125
We... we got a meeting set up
with Johnny's old partner.

26:14.245 --> 26:15.606
We're gonna start a
missing persons thing.

26:15.726 --> 26:17.402
No, but shouldn't that
be happening already?

26:18.237 --> 26:20.269
Well, I mean, technically
you gotta wait 24 hours.

26:20.389 --> 26:22.261
But we'll get him to put a jump on it.

26:22.887 --> 26:25.268
I-if you hear anything, call us.

26:42.453 --> 26:44.063
This is all my fault.

26:44.927 --> 26:49.270
Goddamn it. Shit.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.091
Just find our daughter, Tommy.

26:54.244 --> 26:56.881
If it is the last thing that
you ever do for me,

26:57.363 --> 26:59.565
you find her, and you bring her home.

27:07.017 --> 27:09.141
God.

27:16.951 --> 27:18.953
Are you wearing a thong?

27:20.279 --> 27:25.326
Yep. Don't know why.

27:35.270 --> 27:36.640
Take another one.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.859
Ok, enough is enough.

27:38.979 --> 27:43.166
Colleen, how many you got?  Jeez.
I feel like Brad and Angelina Jolie,

27:43.286 --> 27:46.899
except I don't have her tits or vagina.

27:47.019 --> 27:49.293
You can have mine.

27:49.413 --> 27:51.982
There's never any hot
guys in this shit hole.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.850
You know what? This is a shit hole.
I don't know why

27:53.918 --> 27:55.619
a good-lookin' broad
like you's in here.

27:55.686 --> 27:59.890
Well, I told you.
My... my son, he's like the manager or...

27:59.957 --> 28:02.626
- I'm sure he's a...
- Oh! There he is. Hank!

28:02.693 --> 28:03.986
- Come here a second.
- Hey.

28:04.106 --> 28:08.065
Come to mommy.
Look at what I found. A fireman.

28:08.747 --> 28:10.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:10.268 --> 28:10.904
What's up? Yeah.

28:11.024 --> 28:14.037
And this is his darling
daughter, Colleen.

28:14.105 --> 28:15.105
It's Colleen.

28:15.173 --> 28:16.460
Colleen.
It's nice to meet you.

28:16.580 --> 28:18.381
Nice to meet you.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.044
Hey, any word on Colleen?

28:21.112 --> 28:22.345
No.

28:22.413 --> 28:23.645
How's Janet holding up?

28:23.967 --> 28:25.017
Aw, great.

28:26.339 --> 28:29.653
She went back to the apartment
to see if, uh, Colleen shows up.

28:30.766 --> 28:32.648
Hey, did I, uh...

28:33.442 --> 28:35.627
did I show up
at your apartment last night?

28:36.323 --> 28:37.562
You don't remember?

28:38.062 --> 28:39.329
Uh, fuzzy.

28:39.397 --> 28:43.500
Uh, yeah. You showed up, and
you were high as a balloon

28:43.568 --> 28:45.369
at the goddamn Macy's parade.

28:46.237 --> 28:48.505
Was, uh... who was there?

28:48.573 --> 28:49.991
Was there any... was
there somebody else?

28:50.111 --> 28:51.007
What do you mean?

28:51.876 --> 28:53.021
Was Mickey there?

28:53.511 --> 28:54.470
Mickey who?

28:54.912 --> 28:58.016
Mickey the mouse. Mickey.

28:58.763 --> 29:04.673
Uh-huh. Ok, what would Mickey be doing
at my apartment in the middle of the night?

29:10.027 --> 29:11.606
Is he out?

29:12.177 --> 29:13.458
Right.

29:26.410 --> 29:29.446
Huh.

29:29.513 --> 29:33.116
Pretty girl, but no.
I never seen her in here before.

29:33.184 --> 29:34.739
Well, this would have been last night.

29:34.975 --> 29:36.340
Didn't see her last night.

29:36.687 --> 29:37.743
But you were here?

29:37.863 --> 29:38.896
- Last night?
- Yeah.

29:39.016 --> 29:43.193
No. Wait. This is last
night you're askin' about?

29:43.261 --> 29:44.928
- Yes.
- Yes.

29:44.996 --> 29:46.062
Yes, what?

29:46.130 --> 29:47.000
I wasn't here.

29:47.570 --> 29:48.670
Who was here?

29:49.033 --> 29:51.553
Lots of people, I imagine,
folks drinkin' and what.

29:51.673 --> 29:53.102
No, no, no. We mean tending bar.

29:53.377 --> 29:54.532
My brother, Seamus.

29:54.652 --> 29:57.657
He'll be here in about 20 minutes
if you care to wait.

29:58.540 --> 29:59.997
Maybe we should hang, dude, you know?

30:00.117 --> 30:01.191
This is the last Henderson's in the city,

30:01.311 --> 30:03.261
and it'll save us the drive
if it is the right place, right?

30:03.381 --> 30:05.482
- Good point, bro. Again.
- God, you're on fire.

30:05.549 --> 30:07.032
I am on fire, dude.

30:07.152 --> 30:08.646
- We'll hang.
- Guys.

30:09.036 --> 30:10.554
Are you gentleman police officers?

30:10.674 --> 30:11.922
FDNY.

30:11.989 --> 30:13.223
Well, set yourselves down.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.191
I'll pour you a little somethin'
free of charge.

30:15.259 --> 30:16.593
Ah, hey. Thanks, man.

30:16.661 --> 30:17.460
Sweet, dude.

30:17.528 --> 30:19.262
I feel shitty sayin' it,
but I can get used to this

30:19.330 --> 30:20.586
whole missing persons thing.

30:22.591 --> 30:25.584
What about a... what about another
drink, Tom?

30:25.704 --> 30:28.718
Maybe it'll help nudge some more
information up to the surface.

30:29.567 --> 30:32.045
Oh, God.
I don't...

30:32.922 --> 30:36.722
What are you doin' here, Tommy?
Why are you still here?

30:37.315 --> 30:39.339
You know, if she was my child,

30:39.589 --> 30:41.497
you know, my own flesh and blood,

30:41.617 --> 30:44.654
I wouldn't be sittin' here on my ass,
waitin' for her to sashay through the door.

30:44.722 --> 30:48.072
I'd be out there right now
looking under every goddamn rock

30:48.192 --> 30:49.125
in every city!

30:49.193 --> 30:51.027
- Listen, I...
- No, I don't give a shit!

30:51.095 --> 30:54.664
All right?! No, no, you lost her!
You find her! Now, Tommy!

30:54.732 --> 30:55.398
You find her!

30:56.167 --> 30:58.335
I think... goddamn it.

30:58.455 --> 30:59.842
Come here.

31:02.079 --> 31:03.151
Hello.

31:03.917 --> 31:06.227
No, I think you have the wrong number.

31:07.578 --> 31:10.446
My friend from last night? Alice?

31:11.296 --> 31:13.384
Jean. Jean.

31:13.884 --> 31:15.900
Where did we meet?

31:25.863 --> 31:29.592
Hey. Where are you goin'?

31:30.682 --> 31:33.438
We're just gonna watch
some TV up in Hank's room.

31:33.938 --> 31:36.967
Oh, let 'em go and have some fun.
They're both good kids.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.709
It's not like anything bad's gonna
happen. I mean, she's got condoms.

31:39.777 --> 31:43.749
Heh heh. Ok. Wait a minute.

31:43.869 --> 31:46.000
What? Th-th... whoa. WA. Whoa.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.899
Condoms? Sorry.

31:48.851 --> 31:52.347
I mean... uhh. Shit.

31:53.475 --> 31:54.538
Good. Good.

31:56.964 --> 32:00.063
- Ok. That's it. Let's get your jacket...
- No.

32:00.131 --> 32:00.897
- You know what?
- No!

32:00.965 --> 32:02.399
Actually, forget your jacket.
We're not getting your jacket.

32:02.466 --> 32:03.666
- No, daddy! Stop it!
- Let's go.

32:03.734 --> 32:04.300
No!

32:04.368 --> 32:07.037
You can make a new jacket out
of your... your condoms. You...

32:07.104 --> 32:09.509
Go ahead. Hey. Come on, honey.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.834
Condoms...

32:16.781 --> 32:19.182
I can't believe that you
are wearing a thong.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.184
Ok, of all the reactions
I've had to that particular

32:21.252 --> 32:23.353
situation, this is the first
one that involves anger.

32:23.799 --> 32:26.792
Did I not ask you twice,
twice to wear a thong?

32:26.912 --> 32:30.287
Once, 2 Easters ago, um, with the
Tequila, and then

32:30.407 --> 32:32.758
on fourth of July on the beach
with the champagne.

32:33.161 --> 32:36.078
It was 3 times, OK?
You're forgetting the rosh hashana bender.

32:36.078 --> 32:38.241
I guess you just
don't buy enough alcohol.

32:38.543 --> 32:41.871
Or I don't buy cheap
polyester, "look at me.

32:41.991 --> 32:43.540
I'm a whore," colored thong.

32:43.607 --> 32:45.675
Ok, I'm not a whore, all right? I...

32:45.743 --> 32:48.993
Did you sleep with her, or did you
just go through her panty drawer?

32:49.482 --> 32:52.482
I don't remember, OK?
I do remember this... her name is Jean,

32:52.550 --> 32:55.518
and she had a great ass and
great tits, and she had legs

32:55.586 --> 32:58.663
- that went on for...
- Tommy.

32:58.783 --> 33:03.118
You stud. Ha ha. I never thought
I'd see you again, you know,

33:03.238 --> 33:05.125
after the way you stormed out last night.

33:06.475 --> 33:07.547
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:07.667 --> 33:08.565
Ooh.

33:08.632 --> 33:10.103
Is Jean home?

33:11.384 --> 33:15.060
Oh, you silly. Come here.
Oh, come on.

33:20.344 --> 33:22.390
She didn't come back
here, as far as I know.

33:23.047 --> 33:26.958
Well, maybe she met up with your son.
Is he here? You could ask him, maybe.

33:27.078 --> 33:29.658
No skin off my hump. Hank!

33:30.054 --> 33:30.920
What?!

33:31.175 --> 33:32.735
Can you come down for a sec?

33:33.208 --> 33:34.377
I'm busy!

33:34.992 --> 33:38.928
Probably masturbatin'.
He... he sees a therapist about it.

33:39.396 --> 33:41.341
Come down. We have guests.

33:41.461 --> 33:42.552
Damn it!

33:43.546 --> 33:46.236
I... I think I might have a
pair of your earrings.

33:46.303 --> 33:47.303
Oh, it can't be mine.

33:47.371 --> 33:50.974
No, see, my... my lobes, they...
they're prone to infection.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.282
Oh, good.
So I'm not the only one.

33:54.251 --> 33:56.395
Are you missing any underwear?

33:56.680 --> 33:59.482
Uhh. I don't wear underwear.

33:59.550 --> 34:00.601
Oh.

34:00.721 --> 34:04.467
Hank! Be nice.

34:05.163 --> 34:07.933
You remember Tommy from last night.

34:08.489 --> 34:11.956
Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize you without
your tongue halfway down my mother's throat.

34:12.077 --> 34:13.228
That's not pleasant.

34:13.297 --> 34:14.130
Kiss my balls?

34:14.197 --> 34:16.466
You know, maybe if I did, you
wouldn't jerk off so much.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.132
I don't jerk off!

34:20.103 --> 34:21.112
Sorry.

34:21.233 --> 34:26.235
So, uh, Jean, this, uh... this
bar where you met Tommy and

34:26.355 --> 34:29.938
Colleen last night, where exactly is that?
We're thinking about maybe

34:30.058 --> 34:31.610
stoppin' over there and
checkin' the place out.

34:31.730 --> 34:34.658
Oh, it's really close by, but I
don't know where Henderson's is.

34:34.777 --> 34:37.654
See, we met at a place
called the Rockaway Beach Inn.

34:37.721 --> 34:41.096
I know every bar for miles around.
There's no Henderson's.

34:41.559 --> 34:45.094
Well, it's not like we expected
to find her waitin' for us in there.

34:45.161 --> 34:47.597
No, but we are gonna find her, Tommy.

34:47.665 --> 34:51.668
I know, but she could be 50
feet away in some basement here.

34:51.788 --> 34:55.706
She could be 50 miles away
in, you know, some back alley.

34:55.985 --> 34:57.665
How cold do you think
it's gonna get tonight?

35:00.611 --> 35:03.712
Don't worry. We'll find her.

35:05.376 --> 35:07.618
We are. We will.
We are gonna find her.

35:15.259 --> 35:18.161
I say we grab some coffee, we
assemble whatever troops

35:18.229 --> 35:20.496
we have, he head back to the
Rockaways, we do an organized

35:20.564 --> 35:22.632
search, and we don't
leave until we find her.

35:22.700 --> 35:26.236
Maybe Mickey and Teddy already
have some information...

35:27.438 --> 35:29.572
- About...
- Hi.

35:29.640 --> 35:30.940
Hi.

35:34.632 --> 35:35.885
Remember me?

35:36.790 --> 35:38.697
Sh-yeah.

35:39.739 --> 35:42.704
I'm sorry for showing up
unannounced, but, um,

35:43.122 --> 35:44.834
I'd just like my earrings back.

35:44.954 --> 35:47.202
Of course you can have your earrings back.
I have them

35:47.458 --> 35:49.492
right here. There you go.

35:49.560 --> 35:53.622
Thank you. Maybe I shouldn't have done it,
but I took a few pictures last night

35:53.668 --> 35:56.391
of us, but mostly of you.

35:56.628 --> 35:59.369
Someone was too shitfaced to perform.

35:59.436 --> 36:00.770
Ohh.

36:00.838 --> 36:03.806
I-I'm sorry, but what...
what was your name again?

36:03.874 --> 36:07.371
Before I forget, you owe me $14
for a new bottle of creme de menthe.

36:07.719 --> 36:10.413
The only booze I had in
the place, and he drained it.

36:10.481 --> 36:11.881
That would explain the green lips.

36:11.949 --> 36:14.318
Ok, you said somethin'
about some pictures.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.126
Yeah.

36:15.246 --> 36:16.753
Well, he was in my bed, and
nothing was happening,

36:16.820 --> 36:19.389
so I thought I'd have some fun,
so I got my earrings and some

36:19.456 --> 36:22.225
- hair extensions...
- Oh, yeah. Go to the next one.

36:22.293 --> 36:23.793
- Go to the next one.
- That's my favorite.

36:23.861 --> 36:24.689
Let me see.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.464
All right, let me see.

36:28.532 --> 36:30.066
- Oh, my God.
- It's really not that funny.

36:30.134 --> 36:33.269
My heart.
You are my new best friend.

36:33.337 --> 36:36.060
Ok, everybody's had their little fun.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.341
You got your earrings.
I think we're done here.

36:38.409 --> 36:39.409
See, now you've made him mad.

36:39.722 --> 36:41.086
Now you won't get your thong back.

36:41.206 --> 36:43.787
You have no right to be angry...
I mean...

36:43.907 --> 36:47.838
I'm the one who ended up with an empty bottle
of creme de menthe and a bedroom full of sand.

36:48.662 --> 36:50.787
- Good-bye, everybody.
- Good-bye!! - Bye.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.742
Unh!

36:57.862 --> 37:02.507
2! All right. All right, the
last time I'm gonna say it.

37:03.029 --> 37:11.940
Goddamn it! Fine! 3! 3! God...

37:18.752 --> 37:21.249
Sheila, you come with me.
Lou, grab the other guys.

37:21.290 --> 37:23.619
Go to that side. We'll cover this side,
uh, the far side of the dunes.

37:23.687 --> 37:25.154
- You cover this side.
- Sean!

37:25.222 --> 37:26.756
You guys head South. Franco.

37:26.824 --> 37:27.790
- Yeah?
- You follow me.

37:27.858 --> 37:29.820
- Tommy, where do you want me?!
- Come with me.

37:30.961 --> 37:32.261
Colleen!

37:32.329 --> 37:34.430
- Colleen!
- You guys go that way, all right?

37:34.498 --> 37:36.499
Colleen!

37:38.438 --> 37:39.732
Colleen!

37:45.008 --> 37:46.809
Colleen!

37:46.877 --> 37:49.145
Colleen!

37:49.711 --> 37:51.347
Colleen!

38:03.627 --> 38:05.495
Colleen!

38:15.973 --> 38:18.100
The prodigal bum returns.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.186
I hate you!

38:19.306 --> 38:20.176
Get outta here!

38:20.244 --> 38:21.841
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

38:25.182 --> 38:28.684
Unh! Go ahead!
Get in the truck, goddamn it!

38:28.752 --> 38:30.153
One last chance.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.530
Colleen!

38:44.968 --> 38:47.003
Colleen!

38:47.350 --> 38:49.494
Hey! I got her!

38:50.107 --> 38:51.499
He got her!

38:51.619 --> 38:52.571
Hey!

38:52.844 --> 38:54.333
Guys, you guys, he found her!

38:54.453 --> 38:59.288
Ahh. Colleen. Oh, no. Coll.

39:00.527 --> 39:01.376
Col?

39:02.239 --> 39:04.773
Colleen? hey, hey.

39:06.323 --> 39:07.098
Hey. Hey.

39:07.218 --> 39:08.257
Is she alive?

39:08.325 --> 39:09.759
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

39:09.827 --> 39:11.727
Oh, OK. Ok. She's cold.

39:11.795 --> 39:12.862
Let me give her a coat.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.462
Here you go.

39:14.582 --> 39:17.733
Ah, Christ. Hey, give me your jacket.
Give me your jacket.

39:17.801 --> 39:19.302
Tommy, I'll call Janet.

39:19.369 --> 39:20.899
Hey, Coll.

39:21.019 --> 39:22.038
It's OK.

39:22.105 --> 39:23.306
We got you.

39:23.373 --> 39:24.340
Hey.

39:24.408 --> 39:25.942
Ok. Ok.

39:26.009 --> 39:27.477
Daddy?

39:27.544 --> 39:28.957
Yes. What is it, baby?

39:29.077 --> 39:30.544
Ok. All right.
