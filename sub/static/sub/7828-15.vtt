00:52.449 --> 00:55.118
When Krusty wants to,
he can still blow them away.

00:55.327 --> 00:58.494
Yes. He can take a simple,
everyday thing like eating a bicycle...

00:58.665 --> 00:59.827
...and make it funny.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.542
See you tomorrow, kids.

01:02.711 --> 01:06.543
But before I go, I'd just like to say...

01:15.560 --> 01:17.553
There's nothing better
than a cigarette...

01:17.729 --> 01:20.267
...unless it's a cigarette
lit with a $ 100 bill.

01:21.442 --> 01:25.025
Put 5000 bucks on the Lakers. Hire
Kenny G to play for me in the elevator.

01:25.196 --> 01:27.604
My house is dirty. Buy me a clean one.

01:27.824 --> 01:29.947
Krusty, as your accountant,
I must warn you...

01:30.119 --> 01:31.399
Did you send 1000 roses...

01:31.579 --> 01:33.655
...to Bea Arthur's grave?
- Yes. But she's...

01:33.832 --> 01:35.706
I don't wanna hear
the end of sentences.

01:35.917 --> 01:36.996
George Carlin on three.

01:37.169 --> 01:39.956
Yeah. Lawsuit? Oh, come on.

01:40.172 --> 01:42.165
My "Seven Words
You Can't Say on TV" bit...

01:42.342 --> 01:45.711
...was entirely different from your bit.

01:46.013 --> 01:51.221
So I'm a thief, am I?
Well, excuse me!

01:51.686 --> 01:53.679
- Give him 10 grand.
- Steve Martin on four.

01:53.855 --> 01:55.515
Ten grand.

01:55.691 --> 02:00.318
Krusty, in regards to the large wager
you made on yesterday's horse race...

02:00.530 --> 02:04.148
Come on. How about letting me go
double or nothing on the opera tonight.

02:04.368 --> 02:05.910
- Who do you like?
- The tenor.

02:07.038 --> 02:09.494
Okay. But we're only
letting the bet ride...

02:09.666 --> 02:13.450
...because you crack us
so consistently up.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.917
You've got to stop blowing
your money like this, Krusty.

02:17.133 --> 02:18.592
No can do.

02:20.721 --> 02:22.595
And those ridiculous bets you make.

02:22.974 --> 02:26.260
Gambling is the finest thing
a person can do if he's good at it.

02:26.478 --> 02:29.681
- You haven't won anything in months.
- So I'll just make more money.

02:29.857 --> 02:33.191
- Crank out some merchandise.
- You already merchandised everything.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.813
Krusty's Monopoly game,
the Krusty Crowd-Control Barrier.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.116
Nothing is selling anymore.
Not even your new Lady Krusty line.

02:40.286 --> 02:43.038
But our infomercials are running
24 hours a day.

02:44.541 --> 02:48.456
So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty
Mustache-Removal System, Angelique?

02:48.629 --> 02:51.250
It's Krusterrific, Johnny Unitas.

02:51.424 --> 02:54.129
But is my upper lip
supposed to bleed like this?

02:54.303 --> 02:55.417
Probably.

02:55.596 --> 02:58.930
At this rate, you'll be broke in a month.
Only thing left to do is...

02:59.100 --> 03:01.935
...to open a clown college
and train some regional Krustys.

03:02.104 --> 03:04.393
You mean like that bozo,
Bonko the Clown?

03:04.565 --> 03:06.225
- Exactly.
- Forget it.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.808
I'll just cut back
on the condor-egg omelets.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.735
A couple of those
would be tasty right now.

03:11.949 --> 03:13.526
I'll found the college tomorrow.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.918
It must be the first of the month.
New Billboard Day!

03:30.471 --> 03:32.428
Finders, keepers.

03:35.435 --> 03:37.760
"This year, give her English muffins."

03:37.938 --> 03:40.014
Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard.

03:45.322 --> 03:46.650
"Best in the West."

03:47.825 --> 03:49.367
That rhymes.

03:52.581 --> 03:55.701
Clown college. You can't eat that.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.747
I got everything
I was supposed to get.

03:59.923 --> 04:02.544
I'm not going to enroll
in that clown college, though.

04:02.718 --> 04:06.467
That advertisement had
no effect on me whatsoever.

04:17.861 --> 04:21.111
Hey, Homer. The section you're
supposed to be monitoring is on fire.

04:31.168 --> 04:33.042
Clowns are funny.

04:43.224 --> 04:46.178
- Mom?
- I think I'll have some wine.

04:52.861 --> 04:55.233
- Marge?
- Yes, Homie.

04:57.116 --> 04:59.868
That's it. You people have
stood in my way long enough.

05:00.078 --> 05:02.071
I'm going to clown college.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.782
I don't think any of us
expected him to say that.

05:07.962 --> 05:10.334
Hurry up.
It's my first day of clown college.

05:10.507 --> 05:16.261
- Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm.
- I am holding still. I am squirming.

05:16.472 --> 05:18.880
Dad, you can't go around
pretending to be Krusty.

05:19.059 --> 05:23.009
It's sacrilege. He's a one and only.
I mean, he invented the pie fight...

05:23.189 --> 05:25.941
...the pratfall and the seltzer bottle,
as far as I know.

05:26.109 --> 05:29.893
Yeah, Dad. It was bad enough when you
tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley.

05:30.072 --> 05:32.610
- But Krusty...
- You didn't complain when I got you...

05:32.784 --> 05:34.575
...this close to Chachi.

05:35.787 --> 05:37.246
What's a chachi?

05:40.459 --> 05:44.623
All right. Now, there can only be
one Krusty in each territory.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.126
So I hope this works out.
Tell me where you're from.

05:48.344 --> 05:49.672
- Georgia.
- Texas.

05:50.763 --> 05:52.554
- Brooklyn.
- Russia.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.557
- New Hampshire.
- Homer.

05:55.185 --> 05:58.139
Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...
Wha...?

05:58.356 --> 06:01.143
Those are supposed to be
baggy pants. Baggy!

06:02.402 --> 06:06.530
I've never had a pair of pants
that fit this well in my life.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.027
Okay. Memorize these
funny place names:

06:10.495 --> 06:14.623
Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga...

06:14.876 --> 06:16.536
...Seattle.

06:18.338 --> 06:19.962
Stop it. You're killing me.

06:21.717 --> 06:23.128
Seattle.

06:28.141 --> 06:32.803
And now, everybody's favorite,
the Spin-Cycle Fantastic trick.

06:33.022 --> 06:35.513
It's a great piece of buffoonery
if you pull it off.

06:35.692 --> 06:38.693
But if you blow it,
you'll look like a fool.

06:41.658 --> 06:44.114
Steady. Steady.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.625
Now, when the wealthy dowager
comes in, the party's over, right?

06:50.793 --> 06:52.121
Wrong.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.754
"Kill wealthy dowager."

07:03.517 --> 07:04.845
Burn that seat.

07:05.061 --> 07:07.552
These Krusty-brand balloons
are 3 bucks each.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.648
Get a cheap one, and what happens?
Goes off!

07:10.817 --> 07:14.685
Takes out the eyeballs of every kid in
the room. What's that gonna cost you?

07:14.947 --> 07:16.524
Hey, Bill. What did that cost us?

07:39.018 --> 07:41.307
I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad.

07:41.521 --> 07:44.855
If there has to be a bastardized version
of Krusty, I'm glad it's you.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.941
Thanks, honey. Bank shot!

07:48.070 --> 07:51.356
- That's good aim, Dad.
- Well, it was my major.

07:51.574 --> 07:55.239
Welcome to the noble family
of skilled Krustaceans.

07:55.454 --> 08:00.330
You'll now go back to your hometowns
and do kids' parties, swap meets...

08:00.543 --> 08:04.956
...and the other piddling crap I wouldn't
touch with a 10-foot clown pole.

08:05.174 --> 08:07.546
Now come and get your catskins...

08:07.719 --> 08:09.213
I mean, sheepskins.

08:15.186 --> 08:17.594
This is the happiest day of my life...

08:19.900 --> 08:21.727
Got it. No shock for me.

08:22.653 --> 08:24.147
Oh, yeah?

08:35.961 --> 08:41.003
And now, to help introduce our fantastic
new burger, the one with ketchup...

08:41.217 --> 08:46.294
...here he is, coming in by parachute,
Krusty the Clown.

09:03.786 --> 09:10.620
"To audience. I now proclaim
this new burger for sale."

09:21.015 --> 09:22.639
Lord, save me.

09:26.855 --> 09:28.682
It's the Krusty Burglar.

09:29.483 --> 09:31.559
Oh, my God.
He's stealing all the burgers.

09:32.445 --> 09:33.773
Why, you little...

09:36.533 --> 09:39.569
Homer. Homer, it's all just an act.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.076
Stop. Stop.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.324
He's already dead.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.370
- Sir. Sir.
- I gotta get him.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.873
Get him.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.917
Krusty the Clown, everybody.

09:53.595 --> 09:56.466
Please look at my
MedicAlert bracelet.

10:08.822 --> 10:09.853
Hey, hey.

10:13.118 --> 10:15.276
And then take that and...

10:15.872 --> 10:17.449
...put that in there and...

10:18.750 --> 10:21.419
...here's your giraffe, little girl.
- I'm a boy.

10:21.629 --> 10:24.120
That's the spirit. Never give up.

10:24.465 --> 10:27.003
Well, I guess you're pretty
impressed, huh, Bart?

10:27.177 --> 10:31.341
My dad got Krusty the Clown
to personally appear at my party.

10:31.515 --> 10:34.136
I have a feeling I could get him
to appear at my house.

10:34.644 --> 10:39.353
I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty
big wheel down at the cracker factory.

10:48.369 --> 10:50.278
It's not 5:30 yet.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.134
- Hey, nice threads.
- I'm beat.

11:03.303 --> 11:07.799
And after work, I gotta dedicate a new
Jiffy Lube and cohost the ACE Awards.

11:08.016 --> 11:11.431
- Wow, Jiffy Lube.
- Boy, you're running yourself ragged.

11:11.645 --> 11:16.983
Yeah. When I started this clown thing,
I thought it would be nothing but glory.

11:17.192 --> 11:19.896
You know,
the glory of being a clown.

11:20.195 --> 11:23.564
I tell you, it's hard, tiring work.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.401
But when I see the smiles
on their little faces...

11:27.703 --> 11:30.988
...I just know they're getting ready
to jab me with something.

11:34.209 --> 11:37.874
Well, my time's almost up here.
So I'd like to say I know Woody Allen.

11:41.925 --> 11:45.258
And now, the winner for the most
promising new series on cable:

11:45.512 --> 11:48.299
Old Starsky and Hutch's.

11:49.266 --> 11:52.966
Accepting the award is the son
of the guy who played Huggy Bear.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.934
Let's walk and talk. I have wonderful
stories about other famous people...

12:02.113 --> 12:05.612
...that include me in some way.
- Can't. Gotta distract bulls at a rodeo.

12:05.783 --> 12:07.490
Hey, me too. We can go together.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.449
No. I'm going a different way
than you, Dick.

12:10.663 --> 12:14.707
Your churlish attitude reminds me of the
time I had dinner with Groucho and...

12:14.876 --> 12:16.121
You're gonna have dinner with
Groucho tonight if you don't beat it.

12:20.423 --> 12:26.128
Being a clown sucks. Kicked by kids,
bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly.

12:26.387 --> 12:29.506
Who am I clowning?
I have no business being a clown.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.466
I'm leaving the clowning business to the
other clowns in the clowning business.

12:34.145 --> 12:35.639
Oh, no.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.435
Well, well, well, velocity boy.

12:38.650 --> 12:40.808
I'm gonna give you
the biggest ticket you...

12:40.985 --> 12:42.562
Hey, Krusty!

12:42.737 --> 12:45.821
- I'm not Krusty.
- To think I was gonna give you a ticket.

12:45.990 --> 12:48.148
- Krusty the Clown.
- I am not Krusty.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.238
Hey, Krusty, Krusty. You remember
the time we got loaded...

12:51.413 --> 12:54.283
...and set those beavers loose
in that pine-furniture store?

12:56.585 --> 12:59.254
Memories.
All right, you take it easy, Krusty.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.081
Hey, he didn't give me a ticket.

13:04.426 --> 13:07.130
This is an intriguing development.

13:07.346 --> 13:11.178
You mean I get 5 percent off everything
in the store just because I look like...

13:11.350 --> 13:14.267
I mean, just because I am
Krusty the Clown?

13:14.478 --> 13:18.060
How could I charge full price to the man
whose lust for filthy magazines...

13:18.232 --> 13:20.723
...kept me in business during
that first shaky year?

13:20.901 --> 13:24.352
Oh, by the way, here is your
new issue of Gigantic Asses.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.355
I'm telling you, this'll work. They'll
think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff.

13:28.534 --> 13:32.483
I've been getting free stuff all day.
Look at this swell bucket of house paint.

13:32.705 --> 13:34.781
- Look at it.
- I'm not saying it won't work.

13:34.957 --> 13:38.954
- I'm just saying it's dishonest.
- Lf we agree, then why are we arguing?

13:40.004 --> 13:44.962
Hey, Krusty, hey.
Beautiful date tonight, huh?

13:45.176 --> 13:47.631
And such lovely children
you have now.

13:47.845 --> 13:51.712
- I'm more striking than lovely.
- You come with me. Come with Luigi.

13:51.891 --> 13:54.808
You don't want to sit
with the rest of the scum.

13:54.977 --> 13:56.305
- Hey.
- What's going on?

13:56.479 --> 14:00.227
I only consider you scum
compared to Krusty.

14:00.399 --> 14:03.234
- Well, I can see that.
- Yeah, you see how you scum.

14:08.032 --> 14:11.365
Let me get this straight. You took
money made franchising your name...

14:11.536 --> 14:13.742
...and bet it against
the Harlem Globetrotters?

14:13.913 --> 14:16.664
Oh, I thought the Generals were due.

14:18.418 --> 14:24.004
He's spinning the ball on his finger.
Just take it. Take the ball.

14:25.842 --> 14:30.135
That game was fixed. They were using
a freaking ladder, for God's sake.

14:31.473 --> 14:35.091
I am afraid the time
has come for you to pay us.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.979
Look, I'm cleaned out.
Just take the clown college.

14:38.188 --> 14:39.682
We have already taken it.

14:39.898 --> 14:41.771
Kids have a lot of money these days.

14:41.942 --> 14:45.726
So after you finish your performance,
you might consider robbing them.

14:45.946 --> 14:48.650
What can I tell you?
You can't get blood from a turnip.

14:48.865 --> 14:51.901
You wanna kill me,
go ahead and kill me.

14:52.953 --> 14:54.495
Hey, all right, okay already.

14:54.663 --> 14:57.747
- Look, we can talk this over.
- No more talk.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.994
It is time for us
to take you for a ride.

15:01.211 --> 15:02.753
Oh, no...

15:03.005 --> 15:07.168
- Mind if I go to the bathroom first?
- I see no harm in that.

15:17.853 --> 15:19.679
When he's done in there, I gotta go.

15:23.817 --> 15:26.901
Okay, wherever Krusty's gone,
we'll find him.

15:27.071 --> 15:30.855
Legs, you check out the East Side.
Louie, Rome and Budapest.

15:31.033 --> 15:34.069
Tell the boys
I want a total world search.

15:34.245 --> 15:35.573
- Right, boss.
- Right, boss.

15:35.788 --> 15:42.205
I want a free car because I'm Krusty.
Krusty the Clown. Get it? Krusty.

15:44.881 --> 15:46.838
Cancel the world search.

15:47.550 --> 15:52.924
I want everything that's coming to
Krusty the Clown, which is me, Krusty.

15:53.639 --> 15:55.880
Hey, it's Krusty, all right.

15:56.142 --> 15:59.427
Should I shoot him
gangland-style or execution-style?

15:59.646 --> 16:01.722
Listen to your heart.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.391
Well, I can't
give you the car, Krusty.

16:04.567 --> 16:09.063
But I can let you have this little number
for practically nothing. Only $38,000.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.364
Hey, what are all these holes?

16:12.534 --> 16:14.443
Speed holes.
They make the car go faster.

16:14.619 --> 16:17.288
Oh, yeah. Speed holes.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.995
You want my advice?
I think you should buy this car.

16:24.212 --> 16:26.370
We need more ammo.
Let's go to Big 5.

16:28.592 --> 16:33.088
Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete.
Now, when I remove the bandages...

16:33.305 --> 16:36.590
...don't be alarmed by the total stranger
staring back at you.

16:40.228 --> 16:42.801
I look exactly the same,
you moron!

16:42.981 --> 16:45.851
Oh, nonsense, Krusty.
You look at least 10 years younger.

16:46.026 --> 16:49.525
- Plus, I did your breasts.
- Hear me complaining about the breasts?

16:49.738 --> 16:51.611
Oh, what's the use in hiding?

16:51.782 --> 16:54.273
I gotta go back to Springfield
and face the music.

16:54.493 --> 16:55.951
Can you loan me bus fare?

16:56.745 --> 16:58.073
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:03.043 --> 17:04.868
What you diddily doing, neighbor?

17:05.045 --> 17:08.248
I'm putting speed holes
in my car. Makes it go faster.

17:08.464 --> 17:11.999
Is that so? Well, gee, maybe the old
Flanders-mobile could use...

17:14.888 --> 17:18.222
Wow, lucky I always keep a Bible
close to my heart...

17:21.854 --> 17:26.183
Lucky I was wearing this extra-large
piece of the true cross today.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.192
I think I'll go inside.

17:30.404 --> 17:32.028
What keeps doing that?

17:32.240 --> 17:36.024
I told you we should've bought more
than three bullets. Let's just grab him.

17:36.536 --> 17:37.911
Hey!

17:39.956 --> 17:43.075
But wait. You can't kill me
for being Krusty. I'm not him.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.748
- I'm Homer Simpson.
- The same Homer Simpson who...

17:45.920 --> 17:48.245
...crashed his car through the wall
of our club?

17:48.673 --> 17:51.246
Actually, my name is Barney.
Yeah, Barney Gumble.

17:51.426 --> 17:54.759
The same Barney Gumble
who keeps taking pictures of my sister?

17:54.971 --> 17:56.714
Actually, my real name is...

17:57.182 --> 17:59.091
Think, Krusty, think. Joe Valachi.

17:59.309 --> 18:03.057
Same Joe Valachi who squealed to the
Senate committee about organized crime?

18:03.271 --> 18:05.429
- Benedict Arnold.
- The same Benedict Arnold...

18:05.607 --> 18:08.477
...who plotted to surrender
West Point to the hated British?

18:11.947 --> 18:15.814
I am so glad I had
a chance to meet you...

18:16.034 --> 18:20.660
...before we did this, Krusty,
because I am a great fan.

18:21.206 --> 18:23.328
Don Vittorio Dimaggio.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.207
Krusty the Clown.

18:25.794 --> 18:28.331
Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.422
I cannot do it.

18:33.635 --> 18:38.712
To murder a funnyman
of such genius would be a crime.

18:39.516 --> 18:41.176
Tell you what, Krusty.

18:41.352 --> 18:45.848
Do for me my favorite trick, where you
ride the little bike through the loop...

18:46.023 --> 18:49.723
...and I will let you live.
- But I've never been able to do the...

18:49.985 --> 18:53.484
Hey, how about if I squirt you
in the face with my boutonnière? Okay.

18:55.282 --> 18:58.982
- I'll never be able to do this trick. Never.
- Go. Go.

19:01.747 --> 19:04.534
Hey. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.122
I'm the greatest clown in the world.

19:16.137 --> 19:21.760
The fact that you did not do the trick
well is the biggest insult of all.

19:22.477 --> 19:23.887
Hey, guys. I came to...

19:25.438 --> 19:28.604
Oh, you got a deadly game of
cat and mouse going. I'll come back.

19:29.943 --> 19:32.516
I'm seeing double here.
Four Krustys.

19:32.737 --> 19:37.529
Krusty. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
You came here to save me.

19:37.742 --> 19:40.233
Yeah. That's what I did.

19:40.453 --> 19:45.577
My apologies to you. I almost
made a grievous error.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.371
- Goodbye, Krusty.
- Wait.

19:48.586 --> 19:52.334
He can't kill anybody if he doesn't
know which one's the real Krusty.

19:56.344 --> 19:57.802
I am confused.

19:58.847 --> 20:01.764
- Good one, Krusty.
- Oh, crap.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.845
Because of that
disrespectful display...

20:05.020 --> 20:07.226
...I shall now kill both of you.

20:08.565 --> 20:13.061
Unless you both go
through the loop together.

20:22.413 --> 20:25.497
I can't see, you idiot.
Take your hands off my eyes.

20:43.559 --> 20:45.432
- Hey.
- Not bad.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.811
Without the loop, it is nothing.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.535
Yeah, Krustys!

21:07.000 --> 21:12.955
Grazie. Grazie. You have brought
great joy to this old Italian stereotype.

21:13.172 --> 21:17.039
- No, no, Don Vittorio. You're not...
- Yes, I am. I know it. I am.

21:17.260 --> 21:21.008
- Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
- Oh, you're welcome.

21:21.222 --> 21:25.089
- So we're even now, huh?
- No, we just won't kill you.

21:25.268 --> 21:27.260
But you still owe us the money.

21:28.063 --> 21:30.767
- Forty-eight dollars.
- Here's 50.

21:30.982 --> 21:34.433
And 2, your change.
And we thank you.
