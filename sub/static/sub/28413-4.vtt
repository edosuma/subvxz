No!

21:36.560 --> 21:39.680
...Uh, I'm sorry, but Bo
would've wanted us to have

21:39.760 --> 21:41.200
that money for the baby.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.000
For our family.

21:46.080 --> 21:57.080
[moans]
-You like it like that?
-Like that.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.800
You were gone a minute.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.960
I miss anything?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.880
We got hits for the prints
on the cash.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.160
Nigel Elaschuck
and Bo Townsend.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.800
I left them on your desk,
you wanna walk them into Nolan?

22:12.640 --> 22:15.600
I can do it.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.280
Thanks.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.040
Look at that.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.880
Big wad of cash found
in dead man's apartment

22:30.960 --> 22:33.960
with your prints all over it.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.800
I lent a friend some money.
So what?

22:36.880 --> 22:38.840
A very close one to lend
that much.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.360
We were cellmates
when he came in.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.600
Kid needed someone
to look out for him.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.400
Aren't you sweet.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.240
I felt sorry for him.
He was scared.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.560
Needed to learn a few things.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.480
Being outside with the right
kind of people.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.240
So you put Bo to work
selling drugs after he got out,

22:54.320 --> 22:56.560
waiting to collect
on that protection

22:56.640 --> 22:58.640
when the settlement came in.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.520
Well, you got one thing right.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.440
Townsend promised
to square things up.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.240
He rip you off?

23:06.320 --> 23:09.360
Say he was gonna pay you back,
but he didn't,

23:09.440 --> 23:10.960
and that got him dead?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.320
I been accused
of a lot of things,

23:12.400 --> 23:15.920
but I'm no killer.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.320
An ex-con with morals.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.080
And a lawyer.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.600
I'm done talkin'.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.920
You know, Bo never stood
a chance

23:29.000 --> 23:31.160
at the straight life
after prison.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.960
There's always a chance.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.760
He didn't want to flip burgers
waiting for his big payday.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.800
We got a hit on Bo's car
in a garage in Burnaby.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.080
He lives in Surrey,
dies in East Van,

23:40.160 --> 23:41.120
but his car's in Burnaby?

23:41.200 --> 23:42.320
I can follow up on the car.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.120
We'll do it.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.600
Check on Nigel's alibi, he said
he was at the Golden Emperor.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.600
Yes. Thank you.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.560
Ah, ah, ah.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.880
Don't leave that there.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.480
You're buying the stupid sign?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.960
I knew it.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.400
Does your wife put up
with this behaviour?

24:06.040 --> 24:08.160
Oren Briggs' place is a few
blocks away from here.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.640
Maybe Bo went to finish
the fight.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.120
I'm gonna check the trunk
for the tire iron.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.360
Here we go...

24:23.440 --> 24:25.920
There's a sleeping bag covered
in blood.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.360
There's blood on
the safety latch.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.200
What if Bo wasn't driving?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.120
Maybe he was in the trunk.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.720
There was camping gear
at Bo's place,

24:34.800 --> 24:36.800
but no sleeping bag.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.400
What if the killer used it
to move

24:38.480 --> 24:40.880
what he thought was a corpse?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.240
Bo hits his head on the coffee
table during the fight,

24:43.320 --> 24:45.760
gets knocked out, but
the killer thinks he's dead.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.160
Decides to move the body,
stuffs him in the sleeping bag

24:48.240 --> 24:50.280
to get him in the trunk,
drives across town.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.160
Killer abandons the car,
Bo comes to,

24:53.240 --> 24:57.960
he's disoriented, fights his
way out of the sleeping bag.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.080
Pulls the trunk latch,
grabs a tire iron,

25:00.160 --> 25:01.640
maybe to defend himself.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.960
But he's injured, deteriorating,
and he gets lost.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.800
Winds up in the laundromat
looking for help.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.440
So who drove him here?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.680
Woah, you're playing racquetball
with Nolan now?

25:20.760 --> 25:22.680
What, are you tired of losing
to me, Chen?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.440
Yeah, well I needed
a confidence boost.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.320
He won by one point,
we've agreed to disagree

25:26.400 --> 25:27.920
on whether he cheated.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.360
Meg got results back
from forensics on Bo's car,

25:29.440 --> 25:30.800
and on the sleeping bag.

25:30.880 --> 25:31.840
Yeah, while you were playing
with your balls,

25:31.920 --> 25:32.760
we got a break in the case.

25:32.840 --> 25:33.760
Okay, we get it.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.360
What'd they find?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.560
Clothing fibers, hair,
particulate dust, dog fur.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.560
A blood sample from inside
the trunk that's a match

25:39.640 --> 25:43.360
to Bo Townsend, a second one
on the sleeping bag that isn't.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.480
Okay, have forensics see if it
matches Nigel Elaschuck's blood.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.320
I'm already on it.

I hope that I never understand

to lose a child
to a violent death.

26:57.760 --> 27:02.720
But my father was a cop,
and he was killed on the job.

Six million bucks, sets up

What about the particulate dust?

29:48.840 --> 29:51.480
Composition says synthetic
latex binder.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.840
Water based,
that's house paint.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.880
Colour's blue.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.920
Isabelle's expecting.

That's the colour they're
painting the baby's crib.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.400
She was in the room
when I interviewed her.

30:03.480 --> 30:04.840
If the blood in the trunk
was Isabelle's,

the crib?

the paint dust to Jeremy,

Especially after the takedown
on Bo.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.680
Okay...

30:46.760 --> 30:49.800
If Jeremy killed Bo
and pinned it on Briggs,

30:49.880 --> 30:53.000
could be that strategy worked
for him in the past.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.400

30:57.520 --> 30:59.600
Once the police landed on him,
that was it.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.200
So, he came back into Bo's life
because he was afraid

31:02.280 --> 31:06.160
the appeal would point to him.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.000
We have reason to believe
Jeremy was involved

31:08.080 --> 31:10.600

31:10.680 --> 31:12.760
That's impossible.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.280
Nobody ever tried that
with me.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.880
Probably because they knew
your old man carried a gun.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.600
Bo doubled Sadie home
on his bike.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.360
Drops her off a few doors down
from his house,

33:42.440 --> 33:43.760
so her dad wouldn't
see him.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.200
Sadie gets home,
and the door is locked.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.400
What does she do?

33:48.480 --> 33:51.040
She'd go to a friend's.

33:51.120 --> 33:55.560
Wait, according to the notes,

33:55.640 --> 33:58.920
this is the address
where Briggs' family lived

33:59.000 --> 34:01.640
when Sadie was killed,

34:01.720 --> 34:05.480
and this was Jeremy Clark's
address as a teenager.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.840
Jeremy's family lived around
the corner from Sadie Briggs?

34:07.920 --> 34:09.520
You're thinking Bo wasn't
the last person to see her

34:09.600 --> 34:11.160
the night she died?

34:11.240 --> 34:12.400
Well, she was locked out.
She had to go somewhere.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.160
She went to Jeremy's.

34:14.240 --> 34:19.160
If Bo found that out, that would
give Jeremy motive to kill him.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.920
Ready to start
with Jeremy Clark?

34:33.720 --> 34:36.720
Kate should interrogate him.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.680
You wanna do it?

34:38.760 --> 34:40.560
Absolutely.

34:40.640 --> 34:44.040
We've got him on the evidence,
I want to make him confess.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.320
Then go do it.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.880
Kate.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.920
Don't make me look bad.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.560
Isabelle said you played hockey
the night of Bo's death.

35:02.640 --> 35:05.520
The rink was hosting a girl's
skating competition that night.

35:05.600 --> 35:10.440
I went to North Van and played
with friends there.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.720
And your hand?

35:12.800 --> 35:14.080
I dropped the gloves in a game.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.640
Look, this is crazy.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.600
I didn't kill Bo.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.800
We found blood in the trunk
of Bo's car.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.720
I can clear you right now
if you give me a DNA sample.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.600
Isabelle thinks
you did it.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.680
She okayed Forensics going
into your home.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.920
I told her we found paint dust
in Bo's car.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.800
My bet is, it's from the crib
you were painting.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.720
The evidence will speak
for itself.

35:45.800 --> 35:50.240
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

35:50.320 --> 35:53.480
He was gonna kill me.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.800
Why would he do that?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.440
We were doin' shots,
he was drunk.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.040
Or he realized
you murdered Sadie.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.040
I was defending myself.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.760
Oh no.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.120

36:06.200 --> 36:10.760

36:12.640 --> 36:14.400
Always will.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.360
Isabelle, too?

36:18.440 --> 36:23.480
I'm glad she's gonna have you
looking after her and the baby.

36:23.560 --> 36:27.720
She took it pretty hard when
I told her I was leaving.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.880
Ah, she'll be okay.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.800

you know, before you left.

36:46.680 --> 36:51.280
So, you uh, never got
with Sadie, huh?

36:51.360 --> 36:52.840
It wasn't like that.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.320
That's cause you
got friend-zoned.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.080

gotta take charge.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.640

She pretends she
doesn't want it,

37:04.240 --> 37:05.840

37:08.360 --> 37:11.880

just like you.

All American Rejects.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.440
She loved this CD.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.920
What?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.840
This album.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.960
Sadie was into it.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.160
How did you know that?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.400
She wouldn't shut up about it.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.080
Offered to burn me a copy.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.240
What?

37:38.320 --> 37:42.760
Sadie heard that for the first
time the night she died.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.200
I played it for her.

37:44.280 --> 37:45.640
What are you freaking out for,
man?

37:45.720 --> 37:47.200
That was the last CD
we listened to

37:47.280 --> 37:49.760
before I brought her home.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.640
That means you saw her
after I dropped her off.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.640
You raped her
and then you killed her.
