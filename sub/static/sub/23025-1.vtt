00:56.750 --> 00:59.250
Now let's welcome to the stage

00:59.293 --> 01:02.000
Hu Liang from Class 2, Grade 3.

01:02.043 --> 01:03.625
The topic of his speech is

01:03.668 --> 01:05.625
"My Hometown."

01:15.000 --> 01:16.750
Ah!

01:16.793 --> 01:18.543
My hometown

01:18.583 --> 01:22.668
is a beautiful town called Ji'an.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.958
It's quiet

01:25.000 --> 01:27.125
and ordinary.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.833
Yet!

01:28.875 --> 01:32.418
Because of a band,

01:32.500 --> 01:37.418
dramatic changes took place here.

01:37.458 --> 01:38.833
Who could even imagine

01:38.875 --> 01:40.750
that the well-known band "Broken Guitar"

01:40.793 --> 01:43.668
comes from a border town
by the name of Ji'an?

01:43.708 --> 01:46.750
And the 4 members are all doctors.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.958
Let's talk to them.

01:49.000 --> 01:49.833
Well...

01:49.918 --> 01:50.793
where should I look?

01:50.833 --> 01:51.833
At the camera.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.958
You know,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.833
I...

01:57.875 --> 01:59.583
kind of...you know...

01:59.625 --> 02:00.958
Let's have Dr. Song speak!

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Don't... don't film me!

02:02.043 --> 02:02.875
Say something!

02:02.918 --> 02:04.083
Don't film me!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.750
I'm too dark to be on camera.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.668
Ask him.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.458
He's the chief surgeon. He's got the guts.

02:10.418 --> 02:12.208
Keep away from me, sister.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.000
I'm married.

02:14.083 --> 02:15.793
Are you this shy

02:15.875 --> 02:17.833
when you're on stage?

03:09.125 --> 03:23.375
Broken Guitar! Broken Guitar!
Broken Guitar!

03:43.125 --> 03:44.168
From then on,

03:44.208 --> 03:48.833
my hometown got a new name:

03:48.875 --> 03:51.208
The City of Rock.

03:51.418 --> 03:54.083
One day,

03:54.375 --> 03:57.958
I'll start my own band,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.875
and roar out songs for my hometown!

04:05.793 --> 04:06.958
Let's rock'n'roll!

04:07.043 --> 04:09.875
Ji'an!

Bro Gong.

05:37.125 --> 05:37.793
Have you practiced?

05:46.668 --> 05:48.000
Show me.

06:07.418 --> 06:09.000
Bro Gong...

06:09.043 --> 06:10.708
We want to sing.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.583
Did I tell you not to?

06:12.625 --> 06:15.043
I only asked you to dance while you sing.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.793
We play rock'n'roll.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.793
Wouldn't it be unprofessional

06:18.833 --> 06:20.083
if we danced with the song?

06:20.125 --> 06:21.583
Look at yourself!

06:21.625 --> 06:24.458
You look like an ugly
genetically modified catfish.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.043
And you talk about "being professional."

06:26.083 --> 06:28.043
You think you're professional?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.543
What's the benefit?

06:30.583 --> 06:32.625
I've been sponsoring you for 4 years.

06:32.668 --> 06:35.500
You've only earned 67 yuan for me.

06:35.543 --> 06:37.083
Pre-tax, too!

06:37.125 --> 06:39.168
Now, I'm even too poor

06:39.708 --> 06:41.793
to afford cigarettes!

06:49.500 --> 06:51.333
We have to change directions.

06:52.168 --> 06:53.458
I've raised some money.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.668
I'm taking you to Korea,

06:54.958 --> 06:56.418
where you'll rebuild your faces
and then make your debut.

06:56.668 --> 06:58.543
Say farewell to rock'n'roll
and hello to singing and dancing.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.333
Then you'll be marketed
back in China from abroad.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.125
I'll take you guys to meet someone.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.250
Listen.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.250
Either dance

07:05.293 --> 07:06.543
or get lost.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.668
Where is he?

07:17.293 --> 07:18.793
Dear Cheng,

07:18.833 --> 07:20.500
how is everything going?

07:20.543 --> 07:23.418
Right now, I'm roaming about

07:23.458 --> 07:25.708
in the clouds.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.083
It's such a thrilling operation
that I finally understood

07:28.168 --> 07:31.208
what hovers in the space
between life and death.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.833
Money

07:32.875 --> 07:34.375
is simply a number.

07:34.418 --> 07:36.208
I am already unrivaled

07:36.250 --> 07:38.000
in the field of selling long johns.

07:38.043 --> 07:41.625
Before I was short-sighted.

07:41.668 --> 07:44.000
This double-eyelid surgery

07:44.043 --> 07:46.168
opened my eyes

07:46.293 --> 07:50.583
and incidentally, it opened my mind.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.668
As for the 500,000 yuan
of investment I promised you,

07:53.750 --> 07:55.208
it's over.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.000
Aha!

07:56.083 --> 07:58.500
I mean turn the page over.

07:59.168 --> 08:00.543
I'm offering the 500,000 to you

08:00.583 --> 08:04.168
in the form of long johns.

08:04.208 --> 08:08.418
You'll definitely like
the rock'n'roll style.

08:08.458 --> 08:14.958
After all, you once worked
with the great Broken Guitar.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.293
Don't try to look for me.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.958
I'm no longer who I was.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm a slave to love.

08:25.083 --> 08:29.500
I'm a child of the sun.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.418
All the goods are here.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.000
OPEN YOUR EYES

08:49.375 --> 08:50.750
<Interest-free loans>

09:00.750 --> 09:04.083
How is everything going, Agent Cheng?

09:04.958 --> 09:08.250
I've got something to tell you.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.750
I'm a fan of rock 'n 'roll from Ji'an,
a town in the northeast.

09:11.793 --> 09:12.833
I'm 27 years old.

09:12.918 --> 09:13.333
My...

09:13.375 --> 09:14.418
My name is

09:14.458 --> 09:15.543
Hu Liang.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.000
I'm the lead singer of a band.

09:21.293 --> 09:24.418
We're weak in concert promotion.

09:25.418 --> 09:28.418
So, I need you,

09:28.750 --> 09:30.375
oh,

09:31.293 --> 09:32.333
to help me.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.458
Solo!

09:40.375 --> 09:42.583
OPEN YOUR EYES

09:48.333 --> 09:49.125
Hello?

09:49.458 --> 09:50.333
Hello!

09:50.750 --> 09:51.793
Who's this?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.500
You made the call and
you're asking me who I am?

09:54.875 --> 09:55.458
Are you the former agent of

09:55.543 --> 09:57.000
Broken Guitar?

09:57.043 --> 09:59.250
Are you Mr. Cheng?

09:59.293 --> 10:00.125
Who are you?

10:00.168 --> 10:01.168
Oh, my lord!

10:01.208 --> 10:02.625
It's me, Mr. Cheng!

10:02.668 --> 10:03.293
Hu Liang!

10:03.333 --> 10:05.668
I sent you a video asking
for cooperation on Microblog.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.125
How is everything going, Agent Cheng?

10:08.168 --> 10:09.500
Hold on...

10:10.375 --> 10:12.125
How did you get my number?

10:12.168 --> 10:14.168
The numbers in front of your email address
look like a cell phone number.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.958
So, I dialed it.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.793
And guess what?

10:18.293 --> 10:20.333
Turns out a top notch like you
never cared about your privacy!

10:20.583 --> 10:21.375
Sloppy!

10:21.418 --> 10:22.208
I gotta go.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.750
No, no, no, don't do that, bro!

10:23.793 --> 10:24.833
Mr. Cheng,

10:24.875 --> 10:26.625
would you consider my invitation?

10:26.668 --> 10:27.750
It'll only take a month

10:27.793 --> 10:28.833
to be the agent of my band

10:29.250 --> 10:30.500
and help me promote my concert in Ji'an.

10:31.000 --> 10:31.668
You can make a request.

10:31.708 --> 10:33.125
I'm not interested!

10:33.333 --> 10:35.250
Please...we can talk.

10:36.043 --> 10:37.168
Just name your price.

10:38.043 --> 10:39.625
Name a price?

10:40.708 --> 10:41.668
500,000 yuan.

10:42.418 --> 10:43.750
100,000 yuan has been transferred
to your debit card account.

10:45.543 --> 10:47.875
I'm going to make some quick
money in the Northeast.

10:47.918 --> 10:50.000
When I get back, I'll take you to Korea.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.293
Remember to practice dancing.

10:51.625 --> 10:52.333
Sell the long johns in the street

10:52.375 --> 10:53.958
in your spare time.

11:12.793 --> 11:14.625
FAMOUS AGENT MR. CHENG GONG

11:16.125 --> 11:17.418
Hi.

11:17.793 --> 11:19.250
Are you Mr. Cheng?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.625
Yeah.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.083
Music!

11:27.083 --> 11:29.333
Cue the flowers!

11:45.293 --> 11:46.043
Okay, okay.

11:46.750 --> 11:47.625
Who is this guy?

11:47.668 --> 11:48.958
You don't know him?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.958
He is the famous music agent from Beijing,
Mr. Cheng Gong.

11:53.168 --> 11:54.543
Hi, everyone!

11:54.583 --> 11:55.875
The band Broken Guitar

11:56.083 --> 11:58.333
split up because of him!

12:01.208 --> 12:02.750
Come on! Take a photo with the celebrity.

12:04.168 --> 12:06.583
If you've got the Kuaishou
App, just upload it.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.668
We're home!

12:12.208 --> 12:13.043
Roll

12:13.083 --> 12:14.500
Prince Garage?

12:14.543 --> 12:16.333
Which prince did you breed enmity with?

12:16.458 --> 12:17.125
Well,

12:17.208 --> 12:17.918
bro.

12:17.958 --> 12:20.168
It was Rock 'n' Roll Prince Garage.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.043
The first character

12:21.083 --> 12:22.250
was blown away.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.833
Who is the rock'n'roll prince?

12:26.708 --> 12:28.208
You already know the answer!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.168
Come on in, brother.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.583
Make yourself at home.

12:35.625 --> 12:36.625
Come in.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.208
Take a seat anywhere.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.250
Take a seat, bro.

12:42.543 --> 12:44.000
Well, my shorts...

12:44.708 --> 12:45.418
Sit down.

12:46.418 --> 12:47.668
I'm worn out.

12:48.875 --> 12:49.668
Bro,

12:50.583 --> 12:51.793
stay here from now on.

12:51.833 --> 12:52.793
We two

12:52.833 --> 12:53.958
will share a bed!

12:54.583 --> 12:55.458
No, thanks.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.708
I'll just go to a hotel.

13:00.458 --> 13:00.918
Bro,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.293
I can't afford to pay for the hotel.

13:06.043 --> 13:07.333
The 100,000 yuan I transferred
to you was a down payment.

13:07.375 --> 13:08.875
That's all I have.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.918
What? You're saying you don't have money?

13:14.125 --> 13:15.708
Yes, I do have money,

13:15.750 --> 13:17.043
but I don't have it right now.

13:17.543 --> 13:18.833
My house is going to be demolished soon.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.750
All the removal compensation will be yours.

13:21.625 --> 13:22.668
Besides, bro,

13:22.708 --> 13:23.293
aren't I paying

13:23.333 --> 13:24.583
in... in installments?

13:24.625 --> 13:25.875
Installments?

13:26.208 --> 13:27.958
I still need to be paid regularly.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.958
If I'm not paid for a single day,
I'll go back to Beijing.

13:30.668 --> 13:32.875
Prince? Just look at the mess here.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.708
It'll be okay if I just clean it up!

13:35.750 --> 13:37.583
Well, isn't this the actual style

13:37.625 --> 13:39.418
of a rock 'n 'roll prince?

13:39.833 --> 13:42.293
Look at the double room.
It'll be tidy in a minute.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.125
Bro, look!

13:50.418 --> 13:51.043
This is

13:51.125 --> 13:53.168
the famous Grand Guitar

13:53.293 --> 13:55.083
that the municipal
government of Ji'an built

13:55.125 --> 13:56.750
in honor of Broken Guitar.

13:58.418 --> 13:59.043
Bro,

13:59.583 --> 14:00.543
this

14:00.583 --> 14:02.543
is a gift from Song from on stage.

14:02.583 --> 14:03.418
I've been wearing it all along.

14:05.083 --> 14:05.750
Cool.

14:06.543 --> 14:07.875
It's a nice black leather string.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.333
It was red.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.000
I've been wearing it for a long time, so...

14:13.668 --> 14:14.918
Gross!

14:15.458 --> 14:16.208
Bro,

14:16.500 --> 14:17.625
a few days ago,

14:17.668 --> 14:18.625
I heard that

14:18.668 --> 14:20.875
the government wants to remove it.

14:20.918 --> 14:23.083
Then the Park of Rock is going
to be used for real estate.

14:23.793 --> 14:24.958
I said no.

14:25.918 --> 14:27.875
Removing the guitar has
nothing to do with you.

14:27.918 --> 14:28.958
They don't need your permission.

14:29.043 --> 14:30.625
As long as they leave the guitar alone

14:30.793 --> 14:32.543
they can screw me over.

14:33.168 --> 14:34.208
Let's talk about it later.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.668
Take a photo for me.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.543
Wait a minute, bro.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.750
Please do me a favor.

14:39.043 --> 14:40.168
September 30th

14:40.208 --> 14:41.125
is the 20th anniversary of

14:41.168 --> 14:43.333
Broken Guitar's performance in Ji'an.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.708
I want to throw a concert that day,

14:44.793 --> 14:45.668
right here,

14:45.708 --> 14:47.458
to raise awareness for the whole city,

14:47.668 --> 14:49.375
and to show the municipal leaders

14:49.418 --> 14:51.043
that our rock'n'roll spirits haven't died!

14:51.083 --> 14:53.793
That the park can't be demolished!

14:57.625 --> 14:58.708
Alright, forget about it.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.668
I'll take a photo for you.

15:00.708 --> 15:02.625
In case it does get removed, right?

15:03.583 --> 15:04.543
Bro Gong,

15:04.583 --> 15:06.583
I'll design a pose for you.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.250
Do you know what they call me?

15:09.793 --> 15:11.250
The Pose Terminator of Ji'an!

15:12.458 --> 15:13.000
How about this?

15:13.043 --> 15:15.500
Do that classic rock pose.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.333
The hot wheels.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.418
Exactly!

15:18.458 --> 15:20.043
Just swing. Swing freely!

15:20.418 --> 15:21.208
Faster! Faster!

15:21.293 --> 15:22.583
Keep it down.

15:22.918 --> 15:23.543
Like this?

15:23.583 --> 15:24.168
Yep! Swing.

15:24.208 --> 15:24.708
Come on

15:25.083 --> 15:26.708
I'm going to take the shot.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.418
IRON-BLOODED LOVERS

15:34.083 --> 15:36.208
RIDE ACROSS CHINA

15:39.125 --> 15:40.543
Have you taken it already?

15:40.583 --> 15:43.500
Yes! Soooooo cool!

15:45.168 --> 15:46.083
Look at the helmets.

15:46.168 --> 15:46.543
Awesome!

15:48.875 --> 15:49.875
One.

15:49.918 --> 15:50.875
Two.

15:51.168 --> 15:51.625
Three.

15:52.625 --> 15:53.708
It's good!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.793
Sometimes God is funny.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.793
How did I get you

16:03.083 --> 16:04.875
into bed with me?

16:05.208 --> 16:06.208
Don't touch me.

16:06.793 --> 16:08.418
Go to sleep, all right?

16:08.875 --> 16:10.708
Take me to see the other band members.

16:11.043 --> 16:12.208
Other members?

16:12.833 --> 16:14.375
You think there are other members?

16:14.418 --> 16:15.750
The person lying beside you

16:15.793 --> 16:17.793
is the only member of the band.

16:20.793 --> 16:22.043
Stop kidding around.

16:23.918 --> 16:25.043
I'm not kidding.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.333
But you said you had a band!

16:29.125 --> 16:31.000
I'll have a band if you help me form one!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.793
Why did you get an agent
without having a band?

16:34.333 --> 16:35.918
You're hurting me!

16:36.083 --> 16:36.458
It hurts?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.668
I'm hurting you, huh?

16:37.708 --> 16:39.708
It hurts, huh?

16:41.708 --> 16:42.668
Bro,

16:42.708 --> 16:44.500
why are you turning me down like this?

16:45.583 --> 16:46.793
Are you going for a night run?

16:46.833 --> 16:47.958
Damn you!

16:48.333 --> 16:49.833
Buy me a ticket to Beijing!

16:49.875 --> 16:50.625
Hey, bro!

16:50.958 --> 16:51.708
Bro,

16:52.208 --> 16:53.750
I've already given you the down payment.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.083
Bro!

17:12.875 --> 17:13.958
Still care about me, huh?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.625
Are you out of your mind?

17:16.000 --> 17:16.667
Hey!

17:22.042 --> 17:24.167
Even if you're dead I won't care!

17:31.458 --> 17:33.293
What do you want?

17:33.583 --> 17:35.250
Stay and help me.

17:35.293 --> 17:37.043
Let go of me!

17:40.168 --> 17:43.043
If you don't promise me today,

17:43.168 --> 17:44.418
I'll be part of your leg,

17:44.458 --> 17:46.083
and become part of your body!

17:46.125 --> 17:47.583
You're going to make a scene?

17:48.043 --> 17:48.793
Where's my phone?

17:48.833 --> 17:49.918
What are you doing, bro?

17:50.043 --> 17:50.833
What are you doing?

17:50.875 --> 17:51.708
Calling the police.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.333
Please, bro!

17:52.458 --> 17:53.293
I'm begging you!

17:53.793 --> 17:56.458
I'll give you another 50,000
to help me form a band. Okay?

18:01.043 --> 18:01.918
70,000.00

18:02.668 --> 18:03.500
60,000.00

18:03.750 --> 18:04.458
80,000!

18:04.500 --> 18:05.458
70,000!

18:05.500 --> 18:06.333
100,000!

18:06.375 --> 18:07.125
100,000!

18:07.168 --> 18:07.708
110,000!

18:07.750 --> 18:08.583
Let's make it 100,000!

18:08.625 --> 18:09.250
150,000!

18:09.293 --> 18:10.958
We agreed to 100,000!

18:11.000 --> 18:14.043
Since it's settled,
why are you still bargaining?

18:15.043 --> 18:16.375
So, it's 100,000 yuan.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.293
Let me tell you something, bro.

18:20.543 --> 18:22.418
Ji'an is a city of rock.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.168
We've got plenty of musicians here.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.458
We just need to pass out flyers.

18:26.918 --> 18:28.043
There'll be a huge crowd tomorrow

18:28.083 --> 18:31.083
waiting to be interviewed.

18:45.668 --> 18:47.708
What a huge crowd!

18:48.083 --> 18:49.625
You think we'll have to interview all day?

18:49.668 --> 18:52.125
I WANT YOU. JOIN MY BAND.
The address is right.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.000
All right. Let's get started.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.500
Tell us about your dreams.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Could you please introduce yourselves?

19:02.043 --> 19:03.083
Ding Jianguo.

19:03.168 --> 19:04.125
I'm a bassist.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.125
Ding Jian...

19:07.793 --> 19:09.293
Excuse me, Ding...?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.375
Jianguo (<"Build a Nation">).
I'm a bassist.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.333
It's a powerful name, huh?

19:14.708 --> 19:16.125
Jianguo.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.583
Explosive.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.500
I'm a drummer.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.708
It's even more powerful.

19:26.833 --> 19:27.625
Gao Hongjie.

19:27.668 --> 19:28.958
I'm a tractor driver.

19:30.668 --> 19:31.708
I'm here to get my vehicle repaired.

19:31.918 --> 19:32.750
Beat it!

19:33.000 --> 19:33.750
Okay.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.168
Let's stay focused.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.793
Ms. Ding,

19:37.833 --> 19:40.625
why do you want to join our band?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.125
I just broke up,

19:42.250 --> 19:43.293
so I need a distraction.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.043
That's quite a reason!

19:47.250 --> 19:48.250
Quite a reason.

19:48.293 --> 19:49.250
Right?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.333
And your leg?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.543
Long, white and slim.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.793
Want to touch it?

19:56.708 --> 19:57.833
Maybe later.

19:58.918 --> 19:59.418
Mr. Explosive?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.708
I'm from Taiwan.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.793
I just want to make a living.

20:02.918 --> 20:03.750
Cool.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.958
After meeting with the committee,
we have carefully decided

20:08.000 --> 20:10.458
that you two before us

20:10.500 --> 20:12.958
fully meet our requirements.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.418
Congratulations. You're in.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.708
The rehearsal will be here

20:16.750 --> 20:18.000
at 7pm tomorrow.

20:18.793 --> 20:19.500
Bro.

20:19.543 --> 20:20.168
What's up?

20:20.208 --> 20:21.043
Hold on.

20:22.293 --> 20:22.918
Bro.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.833
That's it?

20:24.875 --> 20:25.668
Yep.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.543
Then I've spent my 100,000 on this?

20:29.125 --> 20:30.168
Aren't they good?

20:30.208 --> 20:31.083
What?

20:31.125 --> 20:31.793
One is on a crutch.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.125
The other looks shabby!

20:33.168 --> 20:34.793
Are we forming a band or
a traveling beggars gang?

20:38.543 --> 20:39.418
What do you mean?

20:39.458 --> 20:40.875
You love legs?

20:40.918 --> 20:42.500
You can have mine.

20:42.543 --> 20:43.583
Touch it.

20:43.668 --> 20:45.000
Play with it. Come on.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.750
Ouch! It hurts!

20:48.793 --> 20:50.583
We only have less than one month.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.500
What's your idea then?

20:52.833 --> 20:54.168
Tell me.

20:57.543 --> 20:59.083
If it doesn't work,

20:59.500 --> 21:00.708
I can take you to meet someone.

21:17.708 --> 21:18.793
Who's there?

21:21.375 --> 21:22.418
Go away!

21:22.750 --> 21:24.168
Hu, don't ever ask me again.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.458
My wife said she'd beat you to death

21:26.708 --> 21:28.250
if you invite me to join
your band one more time.

21:28.293 --> 21:29.750
She isn't Ji'an's only Taekwondo black belt

21:29.833 --> 21:31.583
for nothing.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.750
What?

21:32.793 --> 21:33.208
Shut up!

21:33.793 --> 21:34.750
Listen,

21:34.793 --> 21:36.168
It's only one month.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.168
What do you want?

21:37.333 --> 21:38.668
I have no time.

21:38.793 --> 21:39.793
I have classes in the daytime

21:39.833 --> 21:40.875
and piano lessons at night.

21:40.918 --> 21:42.250
In my spare time, I've got to teach her
to play the piano privately.

21:42.293 --> 21:43.375
So, it's impossible.

21:44.875 --> 21:46.543
Why are you playing the piano privately?

21:47.250 --> 21:49.208
My mom said playing the piano

21:49.250 --> 21:50.293
is neither promising nor profitable.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.958
She told me to learn
math, physics, chemistry,

21:52.043 --> 21:54.333
and grow up to be like
my grand uncle in Beijing

21:54.375 --> 21:55.833
and research the atomic bomb.

21:55.875 --> 21:56.500
See?

21:56.543 --> 21:58.000
If a woman manages household affairs,

21:58.043 --> 21:59.083
the house can collapse.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.375
She wanted to beat me?

22:00.418 --> 22:02.750
I'll show you how I'll teach her a lesson.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.125
Honey,

22:22.625 --> 22:23.708
please stay calm.

22:24.293 --> 22:25.875
Qiao Dashan!

22:29.958 --> 22:30.668
Don't worry.

22:30.793 --> 22:32.168
Let's see what she's got!

22:33.875 --> 22:34.918
Xixi,

22:34.958 --> 22:37.668
what's the benefit of
learning to play the piano?

22:37.918 --> 22:39.750
Because your dad learned to play the piano,

22:39.793 --> 22:41.668
he became a music teacher.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.708
Because he became a music teacher,

22:43.833 --> 22:46.293
his salary is only 1,700 yuan per month.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.375
Because he only makes 1,700 yuan per month,

22:48.583 --> 22:51.000
your grandma could only
afford to take the bus.

22:51.168 --> 22:53.083
Because your grandma had
to run after the bus,

22:53.125 --> 22:55.043
she tumbled down the street.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.043
Because she tumbled down the street,

22:57.668 --> 22:59.918
she ended up getting a
phyiscal exam at the hospital.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.750
Because she got a physical
exam at the hospital,

23:01.793 --> 23:03.793
she was diagnosed with liver cancer.

23:04.043 --> 23:06.083
Because the cancer was already at stage 4,

23:06.125 --> 23:09.168
your grandma died early at age 97.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.833
So what's the moral of your dad's story?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.708
If you play the piano well

23:13.875 --> 23:15.625
Mom dies early.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.708
You want me to die early?

23:17.750 --> 23:18.833
Nope.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.375
So, what are we going to do now?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.583
Study hard in math

23:31.750 --> 23:34.043
and research the atomic
bomb when I grow up.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.375
CENTER FOR GYNECOLOGY.
NO MEN PLEASE.

24:08.418 --> 24:09.668
How far along are you?

24:10.168 --> 24:11.418
I'm not pregnant.

24:11.458 --> 24:12.793
You're just fat?

24:13.625 --> 24:15.293
You got punched and came
to see the gynecologist?

24:15.333 --> 24:16.125
What are you talking about!

24:16.250 --> 24:17.583
I want you to meet someone.

24:17.958 --> 24:18.708
Look!

24:18.750 --> 24:20.918
The man over there is the
great emperor of guitar.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.668
Yang Shuangshu.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.043
Who the hell is he?

24:24.083 --> 24:27.418
He was Broken Guitar's lead guitarist
before they were famous.

24:28.043 --> 24:29.125
He fell down on stage

24:29.168 --> 24:31.000
because of his migraine.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.293
After he left, the band became famous.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.125
He's got no luck.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.125
Ouyang Nana.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.333
Have mercy on me, Monkey King!

24:44.375 --> 24:48.500
I'm just an ordinary young lady.

24:50.208 --> 24:51.500
Dr. Yang.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.793
Sorry about that.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.208
We're closed now.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.208
You could bring your wife tomorrow.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.125
Dr. Yang,

25:05.168 --> 25:08.958
we want to talk to you
about creating a band.

25:10.043 --> 25:12.043
Biao Biao, go play outside for a while.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.375
The Grand Guitar

25:18.543 --> 25:20.918
is connected to my band from before.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.958
It is my unavoidable responsibility.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.418
But

25:26.668 --> 25:28.333
I promised my daughter,

25:29.043 --> 25:30.625
for the sake of my own health,

25:30.668 --> 25:32.125
to quit rock'n'roll.

25:32.543 --> 25:33.750
to quit rock'n'roll.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.543
Dr. Yang,

25:36.583 --> 25:38.625
Broken Guitar has split, and

25:38.708 --> 25:40.708
the Rock'n'roll Park will be removed soon.

25:40.750 --> 25:41.750
In a couple of years,

25:41.793 --> 25:42.793
when you pass away,

25:42.833 --> 25:43.875
the children of Ji'an

25:43.918 --> 25:46.250
will never know about rock'n'roll!

25:50.000 --> 25:50.875
Dr. Yang,

25:50.958 --> 25:52.918
the rock'n'roll of Ji'an needs you.

25:52.958 --> 25:54.418
You have to play!

25:54.750 --> 25:55.958
Save it.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.043
It's such a big cause.

25:57.168 --> 25:59.125
Don't count on a sick doctor like me.

25:59.168 --> 26:01.375
You young guys alone
can pursue your dreams.

26:01.875 --> 26:02.875
Dr. Yang,

26:02.918 --> 26:05.583
back then when you fell down
on stage you were different.

26:05.625 --> 26:09.250
You said it would be most honorable

26:09.293 --> 26:11.918
for a rock musician to die on stage!

26:12.168 --> 26:13.750
If you don't even go on stage,

26:13.793 --> 26:15.668
how can you expect to die on one?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.833
I was only acting.

26:21.793 --> 26:24.293
Acting?

26:26.793 --> 26:27.458
What are you going to do?

26:27.500 --> 26:28.793
You want to kidnap my phone?

26:28.833 --> 26:31.500
I'm calling the police, you old fraud!

26:31.583 --> 26:32.750
I...

26:32.793 --> 26:35.168
I spit on you in the name of Sailor Moon!

26:35.208 --> 26:36.000
You are a fraud!

26:36.043 --> 26:37.750
You don't deserve rock'n'roll!

26:37.875 --> 26:39.043
Fraud!

26:40.458 --> 26:41.625
I don't deserve it?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.000
Dr. Yang, what's this?

26:58.208 --> 27:00.250
FRIEND OF WOMEN

27:00.293 --> 27:01.418
THE GREAT EMPEROR OF GUITAR

27:22.000 --> 27:23.083
Dr. Yang.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.125
Hello!

27:44.333 --> 27:46.583
Hello!

27:46.625 --> 27:48.375
Do you want to report to the police?

27:48.583 --> 27:49.293
Hello.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.375
Hello.

27:50.668 --> 27:51.668
I confess!

27:51.958 --> 27:53.833
I'm too young

27:54.250 --> 27:55.543
and ignorant.

27:55.583 --> 27:57.333
I didn't know he was so amazing!

27:57.543 --> 27:59.500
The whole room is full of guitars!

28:02.793 --> 28:03.958
You see, I'm at the gynecologist's.

28:05.208 --> 28:06.418
Dr. Yang, please don't be angry.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.918
You've been a doctor for so many years,

28:09.250 --> 28:10.875
yet you can't tell this man is sick.

28:11.750 --> 28:14.208
Just tell me.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.708
Can you keep playing rock'n'roll?

28:17.543 --> 28:18.583
To be honest,

28:19.000 --> 28:19.918
my migraines

28:20.083 --> 28:21.543
were caused by alcohol.

28:21.875 --> 28:24.000
Since I quit drinking,
I haven't had any more attacks.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.043
But still,

28:26.208 --> 28:27.208
my daughter doesn't trust me.

28:27.708 --> 28:28.458
She said,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.708
if she ever sees me playing the guitar,

28:31.208 --> 28:32.418
there'll be no way

28:33.250 --> 28:34.543
for me to remarry.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.543
If I can figure out a way

28:39.375 --> 28:40.793
to hide it from your daughter,

28:41.833 --> 28:43.293
are you in?

28:45.500 --> 28:48.000
Today is a very important day.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.208
It's the day our band is born.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.958
- Bro, you're so strong-willed.
- I can tell you are all very delighted.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.708
First, please introduce yourselves.

28:54.750 --> 28:55.543
My name is Hu Liang

28:55.625 --> 28:56.958
and I'm the heart and soul of this band,

28:57.168 --> 28:58.043
the lead singer!

29:03.000 --> 29:04.083
How about I do the introductions?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.833
This person with the Sailor Moon mask
is our lead guitarist.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.043
Bassist Ding Jianguo.

29:10.875 --> 29:11.668
Explosive the drummer.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.375
Keyboardist Qiao Meixi.

29:13.958 --> 29:14.793
Hello, everyone.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.168
Come on! She's only a kid.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.918
Who cares? She can play.

29:18.125 --> 29:19.500
Bro, what's wrong with you?
I thought you were in?

29:19.543 --> 29:21.543
- But you just brought a kid!
- Piss off.

29:23.043 --> 29:24.333
Well,

29:25.708 --> 29:27.208
I'm too scared to join the band.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.168
But!

29:28.875 --> 29:29.875
Xixi has her dream

29:30.333 --> 29:32.668
of persistently pursuing music!

29:33.000 --> 29:34.583
I should give her my unconditional support.

29:37.125 --> 29:37.918
Xixi,

29:38.043 --> 29:39.043
promise me.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.708
I promise

29:40.750 --> 29:42.043
not to tell mom

29:42.083 --> 29:43.958
where you hid your money.

29:44.583 --> 29:45.500
Not that.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.293
I will play hard.

29:50.458 --> 29:51.833
Then I'm leaving now.

29:52.043 --> 29:53.418
Send her home when you're done.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.418
I'll cover for you.

29:55.625 --> 29:56.625
See you.

29:58.958 --> 30:00.208
The strength of a father's love!

30:02.293 --> 30:03.500
I gave him 500 yuan.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.168
It's on you.

30:05.708 --> 30:06.418
What?

30:06.625 --> 30:07.625
Remember to pay me back.

30:07.668 --> 30:09.000
Come on! Let's rehearse.

30:09.043 --> 30:09.918
Come on, Xixi!

30:10.000 --> 30:11.333
Let's get started.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.583
Instruments are over there.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.293
Let me help you.

30:14.333 --> 30:15.125
No, thanks.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.543
Is she the one?

30:26.333 --> 30:27.375
Hey Gong,

30:28.750 --> 30:29.583
this was

30:29.668 --> 30:31.875
the first electric guitar in Ji'an.

30:31.918 --> 30:33.458
He fell down the stage

30:33.583 --> 30:34.583
with her in his arms.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.625
This is the original

30:35.668 --> 30:36.833
custom black one from 1960.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.875
She's the Liu Yan of all guitars.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.293
So hot.

30:40.543 --> 30:41.793
Look at her graceful figure.

30:42.875 --> 30:43.333
What's the problem?

30:43.375 --> 30:43.875
Fuck off!

30:44.000 --> 30:44.918
What's wrong, old man?

30:46.708 --> 30:48.168
Hu Liang, it's your fault.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.418
You think just anyone can touch Liu Yan?

30:51.793 --> 30:53.708
You might even break it.

30:54.918 --> 30:56.543
But it's okay to take a photo.

30:56.625 --> 30:57.500
Come on.

30:58.250 --> 30:58.793
Go ahead.

30:58.833 --> 31:00.000
It can be used as your funeral pic.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.333
Go ahead.

31:02.333 --> 31:03.543
No, let's rehearse.

31:03.583 --> 31:04.125
It's okay.

31:06.750 --> 31:07.543
Hey bro,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
your drum set's facing the wrong way!

31:09.793 --> 31:10.583
Turn it around.

31:10.708 --> 31:11.583
Are you an amateur?

31:12.168 --> 31:14.125
It's the way I beat.
Replace me if you don't like it.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.250
Are 90s kids all arrogant like him?

31:18.168 --> 31:20.000
Who are these people you've found?

31:20.208 --> 31:21.083
An alcoholic.

31:21.168 --> 31:21.833
A loner.

31:21.875 --> 31:22.668
A kid.

31:22.708 --> 31:23.708
And a grandpa.

31:23.833 --> 31:26.168
These amateurs are going
to save the Grand Guitar?

31:26.208 --> 31:27.668
Are you kidding me?

31:28.918 --> 31:30.583
What kind of normal people
would want to be with you?

31:30.625 --> 31:31.543
What's wrong with me?

31:31.583 --> 31:32.793
What's wrong with you?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.293
Someone with a lisp wants
to be the lead singer.

31:35.418 --> 31:36.458
Let's start.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.958
I don't have a lisp when I sing!

31:40.418 --> 31:43.375
We'll run into a lot of
issues on our first rehearsal.

31:43.668 --> 31:44.418
Don't worry.

31:44.543 --> 31:47.043
We can improvise

31:47.708 --> 31:50.043
and fix the problem.

31:50.583 --> 31:51.250
Explosive,

31:51.583 --> 31:53.000
drum something.

32:01.043 --> 32:02.375
It's too amateurish!

32:02.668 --> 32:04.000
It has no basic rhythm in there.

32:04.043 --> 32:05.333
He can't drum at all!

33:23.500 --> 33:24.543
Excellent!

33:24.833 --> 33:25.750
Fantastic!

33:25.793 --> 33:27.000
Energetic!

33:27.083 --> 33:28.668
Amazing!

33:29.793 --> 33:30.500
Awesome!

33:31.000 --> 33:31.793
Attention, please!

33:32.043 --> 33:34.668
Allow me to formally introduce you
to our off-stage staff.

33:35.458 --> 33:36.293
This gentleman

33:36.333 --> 33:38.500
is our band's backstage mastermind,

33:38.918 --> 33:43.250
the president of small
chain grocery store Bonjavi,

33:43.375 --> 33:44.418
Old man Sun!

33:44.668 --> 33:45.418
No. No. No.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.418
It's not a small grocery store.

33:46.708 --> 33:47.458
It's a supermarket.

33:48.043 --> 33:49.543
I run a supermarket.

33:49.958 --> 33:51.625
It's a pleasure to meet you guys.

33:52.043 --> 33:53.833
My name is Sun Dali.

33:53.875 --> 33:54.250
By the way,

33:54.793 --> 33:57.125
all the instruments here

33:57.375 --> 33:58.918
are sponsored by him.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.625
Don't mention it.

34:03.043 --> 34:05.668
I've brought some gifts for you.

34:06.293 --> 34:09.418
It's quite fashionable.
Hope you can wear it.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.125
Almost in every color.

34:12.168 --> 34:13.458
Well...

34:26.833 --> 34:31.250
<....In order to find you,
I started living in a bird's eye view.>

34:31.293 --> 34:33.833
<Hello, everyone. I'm Sweety.>

34:33.875 --> 34:36.375
<Today, I'm going to share with you all>

34:40.125 --> 34:41.293
Turn it off, turn it off!

34:41.833 --> 34:43.333
You guys listen to the radio every day.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.168
Boss Fortune,

34:47.293 --> 34:48.543
why don't you go home first?

34:49.083 --> 34:49.918
Don't worry.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.918
We will escort Boss Jianguo home.

34:53.000 --> 34:53.708
Yes.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.333
Absolutely not.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.333
My relationship with Jianguo

34:58.168 --> 34:59.250
is at a turning point

35:00.458 --> 35:01.375
of love.

35:03.375 --> 35:05.750
According to my very reliable sources...

35:05.793 --> 35:07.168
there are only 3 people in here.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.168
According to my very reliable sources,

35:13.168 --> 35:14.250
Jianguo didn't break her leg

35:14.750 --> 35:16.793
from playing the dancing machine.

35:18.168 --> 35:19.333
You're only hearing this now?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.250
You already knew?

35:22.958 --> 35:25.333
Jianguo's boyfriend was cheating on her.

35:25.668 --> 35:28.043
He fell in love with
her best friend Xiaomei.

35:28.125 --> 35:30.418
Jianguo saw them kissing each other
when she was shopping.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.043
She tried to hit them with her car.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.208
But she broke her own leg.

35:33.708 --> 35:34.750
Ah

35:34.875 --> 35:36.958
we had the same rhyme, homie!

35:38.333 --> 35:39.375
Stop playing!

35:40.000 --> 35:41.250
What damn rhyme are you talking about?

35:41.458 --> 35:42.918
Why didn't you tell me?

35:43.833 --> 35:45.918
I paid more than 100,000
yuan for this information.

35:46.543 --> 35:47.418
What else do you know?

35:47.750 --> 35:48.668
Tell me.

35:48.708 --> 35:49.875
- Well...
- Stop!

35:50.833 --> 35:51.750
You know,

35:51.918 --> 35:54.333
Jianguo plays music, right?

35:54.875 --> 35:55.958
Word has it...something...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.625
the tempo...has...

36:01.083 --> 36:02.000
Thanks Boss Fortune,

36:02.043 --> 36:02.750
Tell me now!

36:03.418 --> 36:05.333
Well, you know.

36:05.543 --> 36:07.583
I believe your relationship with her

36:08.418 --> 36:09.333
isn't at a turning point

36:09.625 --> 36:10.583
of love.

36:12.958 --> 36:13.833
What?

36:15.208 --> 36:17.625
I thought Jianguo was single again!

36:18.918 --> 36:20.875
I heard that Jianguo's ex

36:20.918 --> 36:22.168
is a lead singer of a band.

36:22.543 --> 36:23.793
See?

36:24.168 --> 36:26.043
They probably made up.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.000
Are they falling in love?

36:35.125 --> 36:36.458
Or are they acting?

36:43.708 --> 36:45.168
Jianguo likes

36:45.208 --> 36:46.375
round faces?

36:50.125 --> 36:50.958
Look at me.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.458
Is my face

36:52.500 --> 36:54.083
an oval shape?

36:54.333 --> 36:55.833
It can only be described as long.

37:02.875 --> 37:03.668
She is tired.

37:04.168 --> 37:05.668
She must be studying the
atomic bomb too hard.

37:26.708 --> 37:27.375
Take it easy, little bro.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.958
That's my good grandson!

37:35.708 --> 37:37.625
Don't tell your mom about this, okay?

37:37.668 --> 37:38.375
Okay.

37:39.168 --> 37:39.875
Hurry up!

37:39.918 --> 37:41.083
Watch out!

37:41.293 --> 37:42.125
Get him.

37:46.208 --> 37:46.918
Don't touch me.

37:48.168 --> 37:48.918
Let's go!

37:48.958 --> 37:50.293
Dr. Yang...

37:54.668 --> 37:55.418
Wow!

37:55.833 --> 37:56.583
Bro,

37:56.668 --> 37:57.668
you're impressive!

37:58.500 --> 38:00.208
Do you always trick people
like this in Beijing?

38:01.543 --> 38:03.668
No small talk.

38:05.625 --> 38:06.583
Let's go back.

38:07.458 --> 38:08.583
Hold on, bro.

38:10.125 --> 38:10.793
Here.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.000
What's this for?

38:12.668 --> 38:14.168
The payment installments, right?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.750
You're really nickel and diming it.

38:18.418 --> 38:20.668
I didn't see you when I got up to use
the toilet last night. Where were you?

38:21.750 --> 38:22.918
I...

38:22.958 --> 38:25.375
I was writing songs.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.500
I thought you didn't want
to sleep in the same bed.

38:27.543 --> 38:29.918
So, I'll just stay in the truck.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.333
So nice of you.

38:32.418 --> 38:34.168
By the way, Old Sun wants
to learn to play the drums.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.918
I'll have Explosive teach him.

38:36.668 --> 38:38.208
The tuition is 5,000 yuan a month.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.918
Don't forget to collect it for me.

38:39.958 --> 38:40.543
Sure thing.

38:43.625 --> 38:44.833
But bro,

38:45.043 --> 38:46.208
I should give

38:46.418 --> 38:47.875
the money to Explosive, right?

38:48.208 --> 38:49.083
It's okay.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.043
He can have 300.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.418
May kind people be blessed
with longevity and peace.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.293
Our band will play

38:58.458 --> 39:00.750
a series of shows I've scheduled.

39:01.168 --> 39:04.000
So, we must rehearse a song of our own.

39:04.083 --> 39:07.000
Let's welcome Hu Liang to
sing his original song.

39:09.668 --> 39:11.833
This song "Plastic Bag" is for all of you.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.793
Wow!

39:23.333 --> 39:30.458
<I've already forgotten where I come from>

39:33.333 --> 39:40.500
<I've forgotten why I exist>

39:42.958 --> 39:43.750
What do you think?

39:44.668 --> 39:45.333
Keep going.

39:45.625 --> 39:46.125
It's over.

39:47.418 --> 39:48.708
Your song only has two lines?

39:48.750 --> 39:49.833
Of course not!

39:49.958 --> 39:51.000
I only finished writing two lines.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.168
One week for two lines?

39:53.793 --> 39:54.668
Too fast or too slow?

39:56.583 --> 39:57.375
Hu Liang!

40:00.000 --> 40:01.293
I don't know how many nursing homes
I blew up in my previous life,

40:01.333 --> 40:02.833
to meet a shit like you!

40:03.833 --> 40:05.668
Have any of you written a song before?

40:07.583 --> 40:08.708
Jianguo?

40:09.043 --> 40:10.168
I can try.

40:13.918 --> 40:15.458
There's no time.

40:31.293 --> 40:32.333
Let's practice this song.

40:32.418 --> 40:33.250
You wrote this?

40:33.333 --> 40:34.793
It doesn't matter.

40:34.875 --> 40:35.750
We can play now.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.083
Can you read the score?

40:38.125 --> 40:39.668
Of course.

40:48.375 --> 40:48.958
Hey,

40:49.043 --> 40:50.000
you wrote this?

40:50.043 --> 40:52.375
Cut the bullshit and just play!

41:26.918 --> 41:30.168
<I'd rather get burned chasing my dreams>

41:30.418 --> 41:33.875
Target - Ji'an Nursing Home Supervisior

41:48.043 --> 41:51.543
<I'll just use the simplest brushstroke>

41:51.583 --> 41:54.625
Target - Construction Developer

41:54.750 --> 41:58.208
<I'll always check C>

41:58.375 --> 42:01.793
<I'll always check C>

42:01.875 --> 42:05.375
<I'll always check C>

42:05.418 --> 42:06.833
You must be Logger Vick!

42:31.708 --> 42:34.458
Yoga Studio Owner

42:37.458 --> 42:40.875
<I'd rather get burned chasing my dreams>

42:55.083 --> 42:58.543
Target - Ex-boyfriend's House

42:58.583 --> 43:02.083
<I'll just use the simplest brushstroke>

43:05.543 --> 43:09.125
<I'd rather get burned chasing my dreams>

43:19.793 --> 43:23.250
<- It seems I'll always lose to you>
- You slept all day long!

43:23.293 --> 43:26.793
<- So I'll always just check C>
- Get up and rehearse!

43:26.833 --> 43:30.333
<I'll just use the simplest brushstroke>

43:33.668 --> 43:36.958
<I'll always check C>

43:37.333 --> 43:40.543
<I'll always check C>

43:40.750 --> 43:44.668
<I'll always check C>

43:49.833 --> 43:51.250
Thank you all!

43:51.625 --> 43:52.543
Thank you all!

43:52.625 --> 43:54.208
September 30th

43:54.250 --> 43:55.668
at Rock'n'roll Park!

43:55.708 --> 43:57.208
Be there or be square!

43:57.375 --> 44:01.293
Thank you for supporting Big Broken Truck!

44:01.793 --> 44:03.833
The name "Remarried Couple"

44:03.958 --> 44:05.750
won't work either.

44:06.250 --> 44:07.750
I fully understand why "Remarried Couple"

44:08.043 --> 44:09.333
fails to be chosen.

44:09.375 --> 44:12.333
But what's wrong with "Big Broken Truck"?

44:12.375 --> 44:13.333
That's totally my style!

44:13.418 --> 44:15.750
If it's about your style,
then why don't you use Lisper?

44:15.958 --> 44:18.000
My suggestion,
"Let Me Tell You" sounds great.

44:18.043 --> 44:19.208
My master is right.

44:19.250 --> 44:19.668
Yes, it is.

44:19.708 --> 44:21.293
What the hell?

44:21.375 --> 44:22.958
It's... you know

44:23.208 --> 44:23.793
band...

44:23.833 --> 44:25.500
It's too tricky for me.

44:25.543 --> 44:27.293
I can't pronounce it correctly!

44:27.333 --> 44:29.543
Stop discussing the ones
that've been ruled out.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.750
Let's pick one between

44:31.793 --> 44:34.208
Xixi's "Little Beauty"

44:34.250 --> 44:35.875
and Jianguo's "Heavenly Hound."

44:36.083 --> 44:37.293
Let's vote.

44:37.333 --> 44:38.250
No need to vote then.

44:38.293 --> 44:38.918
Come!

44:39.543 --> 44:40.543
That's it!

44:40.833 --> 44:42.418
Then I vote for Heavenly Hound!

44:42.793 --> 44:43.793
The Heavenly Hound

44:43.833 --> 44:44.958
will eat the moon.

44:45.583 --> 44:46.918
- Beautiful
- Cheers!

44:47.168 --> 44:48.125
and romantic!

44:48.333 --> 44:49.043
Isn't it, Jianguo?

44:49.333 --> 44:50.793
It has nothing to do with the moon.

44:51.293 --> 44:53.668
A bitch mates with a hound...
That's heavenly.

44:53.750 --> 44:54.583
Heavenly Hound.

44:56.543 --> 44:58.458
Instead of Heavenly Hound,

44:58.668 --> 45:00.125
it should be called Mating Hound.

45:11.043 --> 45:12.168
"Check C"...

45:12.958 --> 45:14.000
You wrote it?

45:14.833 --> 45:15.918
I wrote it in school.

45:16.625 --> 45:17.708
Back then during my exams,

45:17.750 --> 45:20.083
I answered C on all the
multiple choice questions.

45:21.168 --> 45:22.293
Within a minute I handed my paper

45:22.750 --> 45:24.083
and went to band practice.

45:24.293 --> 45:25.500
You formed a band before?

45:26.250 --> 45:27.250
Yep.

45:28.208 --> 45:29.583
I was the guitarist and the lead singer.

45:30.418 --> 45:31.793
But these past few days

45:32.043 --> 45:33.500
how come I didn't see you play the guitar?

45:36.458 --> 45:37.750
I can't play the guitar anymore.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.543
In college I went to go perform somewhere

45:40.583 --> 45:42.625
and I was hit by a drunk pedicab driver.

45:44.458 --> 45:47.083
My index finger and middle finger

45:47.125 --> 45:48.750
haven't been agile since then.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.875
A scissor hand forever.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.875
What brought you into the path of music?

45:57.375 --> 45:59.250
Ka Kui Wong was my idol when I was a kid.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.458
My dream was to sing his songs on stage.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.668
Every day, I begged my dad,

46:05.083 --> 46:06.375
"I want to play the guitar!"

46:06.418 --> 46:07.750
"I want to learn music!"

46:08.708 --> 46:10.458
But my family was poor.

46:10.833 --> 46:11.833
My dad was laid off.

46:11.875 --> 46:13.208
My mom was a housewife.

46:13.250 --> 46:14.708
She's been a housewife all her life.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.625
But

46:15.668 --> 46:18.708
I kept bothering my father every day.

46:19.168 --> 46:20.833
And after more than six months,

46:20.875 --> 46:22.000
finally one day,

46:23.083 --> 46:24.458
my dad beat me.

46:26.875 --> 46:28.583
Soon after that,

46:29.293 --> 46:32.043
I got my first ever guitar.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.293
Later, I found out

46:37.250 --> 46:39.043
my mom carried her sewing
machine to the market

46:39.083 --> 46:41.375
and sewed and hemmed pants for people.

46:42.958 --> 46:44.418
Step by step, my mom helped me

46:44.708 --> 46:46.668
get enrolled at the conservatory of music.

46:47.833 --> 46:49.625
I entered the conservatory as a guitarist

46:50.250 --> 46:51.918
but graduated as scissor hand.

46:58.875 --> 47:00.668
You quit the band

47:01.083 --> 47:02.250
because of your fingers?

47:03.668 --> 47:04.793
No,

47:05.750 --> 47:07.208
I was expelled from school.

47:07.833 --> 47:09.250
I couldn't play the guitar

47:09.293 --> 47:11.083
so I didn't want to sing anymore.

47:11.125 --> 47:14.000
I went to Beijing and became a young agent.

47:15.083 --> 47:17.043
I was asked to be responsible
for Broken Guitar's business.

47:18.208 --> 47:20.500
But no one loved rock'n'roll back then.

47:21.208 --> 47:22.750
So the band split in just a few days.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.250
I became the industry's laughing stock,

47:27.418 --> 47:29.668
and I was fired.

47:46.083 --> 47:48.168
Hu Liang, are you out of your mind?

47:50.583 --> 47:51.458
Bro,

47:51.625 --> 47:52.668
just relax!

47:53.458 --> 47:55.500
We'll never fire you!

47:55.668 --> 47:57.668
Forget the band name talk.

47:58.043 --> 47:58.500
Attention, please!

47:59.500 --> 48:00.875
Gong's mother used her sewing machine

48:00.918 --> 48:02.458
to support and help him achieve

48:02.500 --> 48:04.958
his accomplishments today.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.918
So from now on, our band will be called

48:07.958 --> 48:10.918
Bloody Hell Mother of Gong!

48:16.418 --> 48:18.000
Let's rock'n'roll,

48:18.043 --> 48:21.418
Sewing Machine!

48:24.083 --> 48:25.918
Grand Guitar,

48:25.958 --> 48:28.958
we're going to defend you!

48:39.918 --> 48:40.668
Boss Ding.

48:41.333 --> 48:42.958
I guess Jianguo is okay.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.750
She won't make any trouble now.

48:44.793 --> 48:46.333
Bullshit!

48:46.375 --> 48:49.000
If their concert succeeds,

48:49.043 --> 48:50.083
the government will see

48:50.125 --> 48:51.168
the audience's enthusiasm

48:51.208 --> 48:52.293
and feel the spirit of rock'n'roll.

48:52.333 --> 48:54.833
Then what'll happen to the
land of Rock'n'roll Park?

48:54.875 --> 48:57.000
We've been working on it
for more than 6 months.

48:57.083 --> 48:58.293
It's almost there.

48:58.333 --> 49:00.458
But I've been kicked by my own daughter.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.543
Oh, I see.

49:01.583 --> 49:03.043
I'm going to get rid of
the band immediately.

49:03.125 --> 49:05.293
Idiot!

49:06.418 --> 49:08.875
What's our company's slogan?

49:08.918 --> 49:09.875
Say it again!

49:10.458 --> 49:11.958
Strategies come first

49:12.375 --> 49:13.668
before compulsory demolitions.

49:14.168 --> 49:15.043
Come on!

49:15.083 --> 49:16.458
I'm going to risk my life fighting you!

49:16.500 --> 49:17.833
I want to see!

49:17.875 --> 49:19.418
To anyone who dares remove my factory,

49:19.500 --> 49:20.543
I'll dig your grave!

49:21.000 --> 49:21.750
Come on!

49:22.708 --> 49:23.458
Go ahead!

49:41.125 --> 49:42.125
I'm impressed!

49:42.168 --> 49:43.583
You're a true man!

49:43.833 --> 49:45.000
Mr. Deng, right?

49:45.418 --> 49:46.543
Today I've come

49:47.168 --> 49:49.125
to bring you a small gift.

49:50.208 --> 49:50.958
Come on.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Open it!

49:55.793 --> 49:57.793
I saved your brother

49:58.875 --> 50:01.083
from the casino in Macau.

50:02.000 --> 50:02.875
His debt

50:03.250 --> 50:04.293
has been paid off.

50:05.083 --> 50:07.708
The 3 million yuan in cash is yours.

50:08.250 --> 50:09.875
Just think about it.

50:10.293 --> 50:11.333
Are you okay with

50:12.125 --> 50:14.000
the demolition or not?

50:16.375 --> 50:16.958
Follow my orders.

50:17.000 --> 50:17.708
Hydraulic excavators in the back, come on!

50:17.833 --> 50:18.333
Drive ahead,

50:18.375 --> 50:18.918
young man.

50:19.083 --> 50:19.543
Just remove it.

50:19.750 --> 50:20.833
All of it.

50:20.875 --> 50:21.543
Go ahead.

50:21.583 --> 50:22.625
Come on.

50:23.043 --> 50:23.250
Just get rid of it.

50:23.375 --> 50:24.583
Demolish it!

50:24.625 --> 50:26.875
I already have a bad
relationship with Jianguo.

50:27.043 --> 50:28.583
If I get rid of her band,

50:28.750 --> 50:30.375
she'll hate me forever.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.958
Giving up her position as Vice President
at a big company...

50:34.000 --> 50:36.333
She just despises her dad.

50:37.250 --> 50:38.668
I have no idea

50:38.708 --> 50:40.250
where I went wrong.

50:40.543 --> 50:42.418
Hello, President Ding!

50:42.543 --> 50:43.750
Hello!

50:44.333 --> 50:45.250
Listen.

50:45.418 --> 50:46.918
Go behind her back.

50:47.125 --> 50:48.418
Don't let her know.

50:48.458 --> 50:49.625
Also,

50:49.668 --> 50:52.708
you keep that fool
Fortune away from Jianguo!

50:54.125 --> 50:56.168
Go to Second Sister's Pork
Intestines Noodle Shop.

51:00.333 --> 51:02.293
Those were my father-in-law's words?

51:03.375 --> 51:05.750
Don't push me too far, or I'll ask
my father to withdraw his capital.

51:05.793 --> 51:07.750
And demand Jianguo marry me obediently.

51:07.918 --> 51:09.458
Make him behave like a father!

51:20.418 --> 51:21.668
The detectaphones are all set.

51:21.708 --> 51:23.000
Both upstairs and downstairs.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Handsome,

51:25.043 --> 51:26.625
what's wrong with your handsome face?

51:27.208 --> 51:28.375
What happened?

51:28.418 --> 51:29.500
You got caught?

51:32.918 --> 51:34.168
The manhole cover near
the doorway was broken.

51:34.500 --> 51:36.043
I might have fallen in the hole.

51:42.043 --> 51:43.668
You fell down?!

51:43.708 --> 51:44.500
- You must be...
- Bro

51:44.793 --> 51:45.750
- Someone is talking.
- Check the money.

51:45.793 --> 51:46.833
I can't believe you fell in the hole!

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
What a yawn...

51:48.043 --> 51:49.375
- Here's 10,000 yuan.
- I can see your shoe pads.

51:49.418 --> 51:51.083
- Go fall in the hole again.
- Why are you so tired?

51:51.543 --> 51:53.000
What are you doing every day?

51:56.543 --> 51:59.083
Did you collect the
5,000 yuan from Old Sun?

52:00.333 --> 52:01.083
Well,

52:01.500 --> 52:02.793
do you remember the two

52:02.833 --> 52:04.168
on the Harleys?

52:04.208 --> 52:05.543
I gave the money to them

52:05.583 --> 52:06.833
to promote us with two big flags

52:06.918 --> 52:08.250
on their motorcycles.

52:11.543 --> 52:12.043
Hu Liang.

52:12.708 --> 52:14.125
Come here.

52:14.418 --> 52:15.168
Come.

52:16.418 --> 52:17.293
What's the problem?

52:18.000 --> 52:18.625
Let me look.

52:18.668 --> 52:19.168
What are you looking at?

52:19.208 --> 52:20.208
Do I have grey hair?

52:21.083 --> 52:23.168
I'm looking to see if
it's a head or a toilet.

52:23.208 --> 52:24.958
Can I flush it?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.125
You're messing up my hairstyle!

52:27.500 --> 52:29.208
Why didn't you pay me back?

52:29.293 --> 52:31.543
Are those Harley riders reliable?

52:31.750 --> 52:32.708
Make a call!

52:32.750 --> 52:33.668
What for?

52:33.708 --> 52:35.583
Get the money back!

52:36.583 --> 52:38.000
What a damn fool!

52:41.833 --> 52:43.000
The bill's overdue?

52:43.293 --> 52:44.500
I'm going to recharge 100 yuan.

52:44.543 --> 52:45.793
What the hell are you talking about?

52:45.833 --> 52:47.958
- I can't stop laughing!
- Both of them are frauds.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.293
Can't you see?

52:49.918 --> 52:50.793
The final payment is due

52:50.833 --> 52:52.793
before our performance.

52:53.333 --> 52:54.000
What are you doing?

52:54.125 --> 52:55.458
What are you doing?

52:55.833 --> 52:57.168
This is my hostage.

52:57.250 --> 52:58.083
Give it to me.

52:58.125 --> 52:59.458
Give it to me!

52:59.500 --> 53:00.043
Come on.

53:00.083 --> 53:02.000
I'll destroy it if I don't see the money!

53:02.083 --> 53:03.333
OK, I won't move.

53:03.375 --> 53:04.125
All right?

53:04.375 --> 53:05.750
I don't want to argue with you.

53:05.793 --> 53:06.833
I don't want to mess up my hair.

53:07.043 --> 53:08.875
I'm gonna see Sweety later, you know.

53:09.500 --> 53:10.500
Do you know Sweety?

53:10.543 --> 53:11.543
Sweety?

53:11.583 --> 53:13.918
The one I've been
dreaming of day and night.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.708
She is like the Lin Chi-ling of Ji'an.

53:15.750 --> 53:17.708
Massage my ears

53:17.750 --> 53:19.708
for the sensation of hearing!

53:21.750 --> 53:24.793
The same kind of night,
but a different mood.

53:26.168 --> 53:29.375
This program is sponsored
by the biggest grocery chain store

53:29.418 --> 53:32.000
Bonjavi.

53:33.208 --> 53:37.418
Bonjavi: It's lonely being the best.

53:37.668 --> 53:39.083
I'm Sweety.

53:39.125 --> 53:42.083
I'll be right back after the break.

53:45.043 --> 53:46.500
Now the floor is yours.

53:46.543 --> 53:47.418
Don't worry.

53:47.458 --> 53:48.293
We are all set.

53:48.333 --> 53:49.543
We are all set.

53:49.625 --> 53:51.833
Cherish the time with Sweety.

53:52.293 --> 53:52.750
Hey, buddy.

53:53.208 --> 53:54.583
You can do it!

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Sweety's giving you a massage.

54:02.168 --> 54:03.875
Just listen to Sweety.

54:04.375 --> 54:05.543
If this goes public,

54:05.583 --> 54:06.793
wow, it's going to...

54:06.833 --> 54:08.333
Oh god.

54:10.750 --> 54:12.958
What's in your head?

54:14.958 --> 54:15.875
Look at yourself!

54:15.918 --> 54:17.708
Still eating and drinking?

54:17.750 --> 54:19.375
Aren't you afraid of getting tetanus?

54:20.583 --> 54:22.043
You two...

54:22.125 --> 54:23.418
You're total assholes!

54:23.458 --> 54:24.793
I just need to make one phone call,

54:24.833 --> 54:26.793
and my buddies will rush to
the broadcasting station.

54:26.833 --> 54:28.708
Only one phone call!

54:28.793 --> 54:31.043
Boss Fortune, calm down.

54:31.083 --> 54:33.750
Your father-in-law told
us to keep a low profile.

54:33.793 --> 54:36.625
So, there must be more tactful ways.

54:37.918 --> 54:40.543
Tactful?

54:41.500 --> 54:43.625
How many bowls have you had?

54:46.708 --> 54:47.875
Come on, eat it!

54:47.918 --> 54:49.793
Taste it.

54:51.793 --> 54:54.293
Hello, are you the police?

54:54.333 --> 54:55.375
Hi.

54:55.418 --> 54:57.793
I'm a taxi driver.

54:57.833 --> 55:00.750
I picked up some passengers
and took them to the broadcasting station.

55:00.875 --> 55:03.708
I faintly heard them

55:03.750 --> 55:05.125
- saying something like...
- Today in Sweety's studio...

55:05.168 --> 55:07.375
- ...they were gonna blow up the station.
- We have our guests,

55:07.458 --> 55:09.750
Sewing Machine!

55:12.918 --> 55:15.875
Could you please introduce yourselves?

55:21.333 --> 55:23.293
Well, I...

55:24.750 --> 55:26.418
I...

55:27.000 --> 55:28.625
That...

55:29.333 --> 55:30.668
Hello, everyone,

55:30.708 --> 55:34.125
My name is Ding Jianguo. I'm the bassist.

55:40.875 --> 55:42.000
Hello.

55:43.250 --> 55:44.625
Hello, everyone,

55:44.668 --> 55:46.375
I'm the drummer of Sewing Machine...

55:46.418 --> 55:48.583
- Sweety, there's danger!
- My name is Explo...

55:48.625 --> 55:49.918
A bomb?

55:50.000 --> 55:50.625
Oh, my god!

55:50.668 --> 55:53.333
Sweety, I'm not a bomb. I'm Explosive.

55:53.375 --> 55:55.125
Freeze!

56:02.708 --> 56:04.793
He's got a bomb!

56:05.418 --> 56:06.500
Hey! What are you doing?

56:06.543 --> 56:07.625
What the hell!

56:12.250 --> 56:14.000
THREE WORDS THEN I LOVE LILI

56:14.500 --> 56:17.375
Dr. Yang, your pose is so out of date!

56:17.418 --> 56:19.168
Come on! Be more of a rocker!

56:19.793 --> 56:22.125
Please deliver my apology
to your colleague.

56:22.168 --> 56:23.833
We received an anonymous tip.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.250
So we were taking extreme measures.

56:25.293 --> 56:26.293
Sorry about that.

56:26.333 --> 56:27.458
Sorry for the trouble.

56:27.625 --> 56:28.708
You can take a photo first.

56:28.750 --> 56:29.500
Come on.

56:29.583 --> 56:30.543
I'll take one.

56:31.250 --> 56:32.125
Just imagine

56:32.168 --> 56:35.418
a smile, the sun shining, and the beach.

56:40.043 --> 56:41.208
I'm okay.

56:41.250 --> 56:42.793
Don't worry about me.

56:42.918 --> 56:44.208
Who cares about you?

56:44.250 --> 56:45.875
All we want to know about is Lili.

56:45.918 --> 56:47.208
Lili.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.293
Lili,

56:50.333 --> 56:51.543
she's a tattoo artist.

56:55.583 --> 56:57.958
The first time I met her

56:58.000 --> 57:00.168
I fell deeply in love.

57:06.125 --> 57:07.793
This pattern, right?

57:07.875 --> 57:09.000
Nope.

57:09.043 --> 57:10.793
I suddenly want to change it.

57:12.083 --> 57:13.958
What's your name?

57:19.708 --> 57:21.043
I'm Lili.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.793
Three words then...

57:22.833 --> 57:24.583
"I love Lili."

57:29.750 --> 57:31.083
It's brilliant!

57:31.168 --> 57:33.083
It's impressive!

57:33.793 --> 57:35.500
Can I ask you something?

57:35.543 --> 57:36.668
Shoot.

57:36.708 --> 57:38.125
Who is this Jixiang?

57:38.168 --> 57:39.000
She's my mom.

57:39.043 --> 57:40.625
But that's not important.

57:40.668 --> 57:41.750
The most important thing is

57:41.793 --> 57:44.918
I had a crazy crush on Lili.

57:46.875 --> 57:49.793
When I was ready to chase her...

57:49.833 --> 57:51.375
she disappeared.

57:51.418 --> 57:53.168
I didn't know how to contact her.

57:53.208 --> 57:55.293
And I didn't know any of her friends.

57:55.333 --> 57:56.793
But I was sure

57:56.833 --> 57:59.083
she had to be from Ji'an.

58:06.793 --> 58:09.918
So, I came here to look for her.

58:09.958 --> 58:12.333
Do you know why I wanted to join the band?

58:12.375 --> 58:13.418
It's because I want to sing
at every place in Ji'an

58:13.458 --> 58:15.333
so that she can see me.

58:15.375 --> 58:17.168
Do you know why I drum facing my back?

58:17.208 --> 58:18.793
I don't want others to fall in love with me

58:18.833 --> 58:19.833
because I'm so handsome.

58:19.875 --> 58:21.958
I do all these things for Lili only.

58:22.625 --> 58:24.250
Listen.

58:24.293 --> 58:26.958
If you drum facing backward,

58:27.043 --> 58:29.250
how can Lili see you?

58:29.293 --> 58:30.750
Yeah how?

58:31.293 --> 58:32.543
How?

58:32.833 --> 58:34.750
How?

58:35.958 --> 58:37.083
How?

58:38.543 --> 58:39.333
Master,

58:39.375 --> 58:41.500
I heard you're in love

58:41.583 --> 58:43.418
with a girl named Lili, right?

58:44.375 --> 58:45.750
What a coincidence...

58:45.793 --> 58:47.833
My dog is also called Lili.

58:49.250 --> 58:50.793
Shut up!

58:50.833 --> 58:52.293
Beat harder!

58:53.918 --> 58:55.375
You didn't eat?

58:55.833 --> 58:57.333
No.

58:57.375 --> 58:59.168
I've been beating for 6 hours.

59:06.500 --> 59:09.043
What's wrong, Xixi?

59:09.083 --> 59:11.708
I can't find my hairpin.

59:11.750 --> 59:13.918
Well where did you go play?

59:13.958 --> 59:16.293
In the backyard.

59:17.625 --> 59:18.418
Let's go.

59:18.458 --> 59:19.918
Let's find it together.

59:19.958 --> 59:21.875
Stop crying.

59:23.293 --> 59:24.708
Let's go.

59:24.750 --> 59:26.833
It wouldn't just disappear.

59:26.875 --> 59:28.750
Come on.

59:28.793 --> 59:30.333
Wipe the tears.

59:31.125 --> 59:31.750
Wipe the tears.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.500
Come.

59:42.833 --> 59:45.293
This is the safest place.

59:45.333 --> 59:47.250
Someone is upstairs.

59:47.293 --> 59:49.543
I want to hear it.

59:50.958 --> 59:52.250
Should we lock the door?

59:52.458 --> 59:55.250
You're so cautious!

59:55.418 --> 59:57.918
Why did they lock the door

59:58.000 --> 59:59.043
on this dark and windy night?

59:59.083 --> 01:00:00.543
I have no idea.

01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:01.333
Locked!

01:00:01.418 --> 01:00:03.168
What are you talking about?

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.875
- Don't think too much.
- It makes me nervous.

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:06.375
Hurry up.

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:07.918
Open it. I want to see.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.168
What's your hurry?

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:11.083
Shouldn't we wash our hands first?

01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:12.750
- Wash?
- Save it. Hurry up.

01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:15.083
- Hold on. I'll unbuckle it first.
- Don't over think it.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:16.958
Listen. Jianguo is a good girl.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.043
Are you ready?

01:00:20.708 --> 01:00:21.793
Wow!

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:22.875
What do you think?

01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:24.958
Isn't it powerful?

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:25.833
What?

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.625
It looks nice.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:29.668
Hey, be gentle!

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:30.793
You might scratch it

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:31.793
with your long nails.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:32.750
It's not a big deal.

01:00:32.793 --> 01:00:33.500
I've touched it before.

01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:35.750
I've secretly touched it several times

01:00:35.793 --> 01:00:36.668
last time when we rehearsed.

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:37.625
Several times?

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:39.458
Well, anyway!

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.250
You have no idea how many
rock-loving girls in Ji'an

01:00:42.293 --> 01:00:43.375
want to touch it.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.875
You've already touched it.

01:00:45.918 --> 01:00:48.708
And you pretend like it's nothing!

01:00:50.043 --> 01:00:51.375
By the way,

01:00:51.418 --> 01:00:53.793
Cheng Gong wants to see it too.

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:54.958
I'll call him here.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.083
The three of us.

01:00:56.168 --> 01:00:57.418
Three?

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:58.750
- Calm down!
- Good!

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:01.293
Enjoying happiness alone
is not as happy as sharing it.

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:02.958
Us three can take a series of photos

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.833
to remember.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:05.168
Don't touch it yourself!

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:06.375
- Calm down!
- Fine.

01:01:06.418 --> 01:01:07.750
You sick bastard! Take a photo?

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:08.668
It's broken.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.668
Boss Fortune!

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:12.000
Calm down!

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:12.750
Let me go!

01:01:12.793 --> 01:01:15.333
- Let me go!
- Just keep calm, boss.

01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:16.625
Give me the phone.
I have to call my buddies.

01:01:16.668 --> 01:01:19.293
No! We'll be doomed if we expose ourselves.

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:20.333
Stop yelling!

01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:22.583
Get his legs.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:24.208
Boss Fortune!

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.208
It's probably a misunderstanding!

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.000
Yes.

01:01:27.043 --> 01:01:29.875
If they were doing that they'd
at least draw the curtains.

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.208
How do I look?

01:01:32.418 --> 01:01:33.668
Stop.

01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:39.875
Let's get wild!

01:01:40.668 --> 01:01:42.375
Oh, no.

01:01:43.793 --> 01:01:45.125
Boss Fortune!

01:01:45.543 --> 01:01:48.000
Jianguo!

01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:48.668
Jianguo!

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.000
Jianguo!

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:55.293
Ouch!

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.918
He might have fallen down the hole.

01:01:59.293 --> 01:02:00.958
Where did you put the detectaphone?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.043
Here. In this room.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:05.168
Can you do it?

01:02:07.708 --> 01:02:08.668
Sure thing.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:30.833
I thought they went to
the school to perform.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:31.543
Me too.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:09.668
What the hell!

01:03:10.418 --> 01:03:12.250
Sick bastard!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.625
I can't get in touch with Hu Liang.
You sing.

01:03:15.668 --> 01:03:16.375
Me?

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:17.418
Yep.

01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:20.875
You can try too.

01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:23.875
You can do this.

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.293
Coming!

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:41.375
Buddy,

01:03:41.543 --> 01:03:42.293
this here...

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:43.043
Sis,

01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:44.583
do me a favor.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:45.625
I need to go, bad.

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.958
What's the rush?

01:03:48.418 --> 01:03:50.293
You're brother-in-law is still here.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:51.918
Now let's welcome

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.708
our local band - Sewing Machine

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.458
to perform their show.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.043
Let's give them a big applause.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:02.458
Nice!

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:32.793
LILI

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:37.793
Students of Ji'an No. 7 middle school,

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.418
thanks for your support!

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.750
Yeah!

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.043
Teachers and students,

01:06:19.668 --> 01:06:22.043
we have a little situation up here.

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.293
What I want to say is

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:24.958
you can take photos,

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:27.708
but please do not post them
on Microblog or WeChat.

01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:32.125
You don't have to worry about that.

01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:33.543
You don't have to worry about that.

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:34.918
Ji'an No.7 Middle School is

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.043
a provincial key middle school.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:40.543
It's prohibited for students
to bring their phones to school.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:41.668
Am I right?

01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:43.625
Yes!

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.708
Thank you!

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:48.250
Next program.

01:06:49.418 --> 01:06:51.418
Get up and let's go.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.250
Sewing Machine's performance

01:06:55.293 --> 01:06:57.875
flooded the city's social media.

01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:00.708
It's getting closer to September 30th,

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.043
the date fo their performance.

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:04.708
Are they going to make a miracle?

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:07.043
I really can't wait!

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:13.708
Stop aiming at me!

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:14.793
Stop wasting water.

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:15.583
Xixi!

01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:18.168
I'll bill your father.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:19.958
Come here!

01:07:20.043 --> 01:07:21.793
I have some good news for you guys.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:25.083
The municipal government will hold
a party tomorrow night.

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.625
And we are invited to perform!

01:07:27.458 --> 01:07:29.375
You mean I can meet the city leaders?

01:07:34.043 --> 01:07:35.958
Does that mean...

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.543
the Rock'n'roll Park...

01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:39.083
will be spared?

01:07:39.543 --> 01:07:40.875
It depends on you.

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:07.250
I remember the night Broken
Guitar came to perform.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.750
Everyone in Ji'an went,

01:08:10.793 --> 01:08:12.708
except me.

01:08:13.793 --> 01:08:16.207
I didn't expect that after 20 years

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:18.457
I'd be here with you all.

01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:21.832
Hu Liang,

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:24.000
if you keep practicing the
guitar the next few years,

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:27.042
it's very possible you'll be the next me.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:30.457
The next you?

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:33.167
It's not going to happen!

01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:36.707
Because I won't have cerebral thrombosis.

01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:53.207
Is Dr. Yang all right?

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.417
He's all right.

01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.250
He only drank 22 bottles.

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:57.707
He looks happy today.

01:08:58.707 --> 01:09:00.207
Do you want to play?

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.500
I can't.

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:06.250
Come on.

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.333
Are you Cheng Gong?

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:24.625
Yes.

01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:26.793
I'm Jianguo's father.

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:34.418
I've heard

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.458
what you've done.

01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:38.750
What...

01:11:39.293 --> 01:11:40.333
we've done?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.793
Jianguo

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.168
barely talks to me.

01:11:48.668 --> 01:11:49.875
I know this

01:11:50.168 --> 01:11:51.793
from a friend

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:52.750
who works in the government.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:54.250
Well,

01:11:54.293 --> 01:11:55.708
if you don't mind me asking...

01:11:56.293 --> 01:11:57.958
How would the government know about it?

01:11:59.293 --> 01:12:00.333
You're a young man

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500
from a big city after all.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:03.668
I really

01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.500
admire you.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.293
Uncle,

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.918
I don't know much about
the customs of Ji'an.

01:12:15.543 --> 01:12:17.083
Does this mean you are offering me money

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.958
or I need to make a deposit?

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:25.625
You're so amusing.

01:12:28.293 --> 01:12:29.293
There's a lucky number

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.000
credit limit.

01:12:31.418 --> 01:12:33.208
666,000 yuan.

01:12:36.543 --> 01:12:37.833
The performance tonight

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:40.083
held by the municipal government...

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:41.543
Why don't you just cancel it?

01:12:41.918 --> 01:12:43.750
The land under the Grand Guitar

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.208
is really important to me.

01:12:52.918 --> 01:12:53.958
Mr. Ding,

01:12:54.168 --> 01:12:55.208
it's everyone's dream to pursue music.

01:12:55.543 --> 01:12:57.958
it's everyone's dream to pursue music.

01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:00.918
I can't just sell it like this.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Dreams, huh?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.833
Look.

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:07.543
ROCK NEVER DIES

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:09.918
I also dreamed

01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:12.043
of being a rocker for many years.

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:15.750
What's the use?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.583
The old guys

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.583
from Broken Guitar.

01:13:18.625 --> 01:13:19.125
Now...

01:13:19.168 --> 01:13:20.583
is there anyone who
actually remembers them?

01:13:21.293 --> 01:13:22.458
They're all tragedies.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.958
Compare them

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.668
to how I am now.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500
What's the point

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:32.000
of realizing your dreams?

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.750
But the "never" in your tattoo

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.125
is only half-removed.

01:13:40.168 --> 01:13:41.043
You just can't let it go right?

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:44.043
You youngsters,

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:45.125
always hanging onto feelings

01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:47.000
with such nostalgia.

01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:48.168
I wanted to remove it completely.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.000
But I couldn't stand

01:13:50.043 --> 01:13:51.293
the pain.

01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:54.043
So, half is still left.

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:11.918
That year

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:14.458
when the Grand Guitar was built,

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.833
I bought some steamed buns

01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:17.125
and brought along my guitar

01:14:17.168 --> 01:14:19.293
to give my regards to
the construction workers.

01:14:20.458 --> 01:14:21.543
But one day,

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.708
the doctor told me

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.625
Jianguo's mother was ill.

01:14:26.043 --> 01:14:27.250
She needed a kidney transplant.

01:14:27.293 --> 01:14:28.668
What could I do?

01:14:29.418 --> 01:14:31.000
Wander the streets

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:32.168
and play rock music for a while

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:34.375
to ask someone for a kidney?

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:38.000
Later, I understood

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.293
that money can save lives.

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:42.668
But dreams cannot.

01:14:43.793 --> 01:14:48.043
Let Jianguo take her
position as Vice President.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.793
Son,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.543
don't be so hard on yourself.

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:54.875
I'll give you

01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:57.083
another 500,000 yuan.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.543
Well, bro,

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.125
just...

01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:08.750
fight for it again?

01:15:09.418 --> 01:15:12.500
It would be okay even
if we sang half of it.

01:15:14.168 --> 01:15:15.543
I've tried.

01:15:15.793 --> 01:15:17.208
The staff in the government told me

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.625
the program is too long.

01:15:19.543 --> 01:15:20.375
That's it.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:31.918
It can't be like this.

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:35.125
What happened?

01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.125
Why are we here

01:16:39.043 --> 01:16:40.043
in the middle of the night?

01:16:47.293 --> 01:16:48.000
Hu Liang?

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:51.000
He works every night

01:16:52.168 --> 01:16:53.583
because he said he still owes you money.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.750
The money my father gave you.

01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:00.500
It was a lucky number, huh?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.250
It looks like I should
go and thank the gods

01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:11.708
for letting me meet another piece of shit.

01:17:30.793 --> 01:17:32.000
OLD SUN

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.125
Hello.

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:23.333
Why did they remove it?

01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:25.958
Why did they remove it?

01:18:27.043 --> 01:18:27.668
Bro!

01:18:27.918 --> 01:18:28.543
Bro,

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.000
they pulled it down!

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:33.625
The Grand Guitar is gone!

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:36.543
It's gone!

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:41.668
Bro!

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:51.333
Stop it! Don't smash it!

01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:52.918
Why are you smashing it?

01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:55.418
What did it ever do to you!

01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:57.833
You're all bad guys!

01:18:57.875 --> 01:18:59.125
You bastards!

01:19:01.668 --> 01:19:03.375
You bastards!

01:19:03.418 --> 01:19:06.958
What did it ever do wrong!

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.543
Hu Liang!

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:29.793
Stop smashing it!

01:19:32.793 --> 01:19:35.083
They are all bastards!

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.500
No, they are not!

01:19:37.375 --> 01:19:38.708
They are just workers!

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:41.333
They pulled down the Grand Guitar!

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.125
So, they are the bad guys!

01:19:44.668 --> 01:19:46.208
They're not the bastards!

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.375
I'm the bad guy!

01:19:52.418 --> 01:19:53.583
What did you say?

01:19:53.625 --> 01:19:54.958
I'm the bad guy!

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.500
I accepted money from
the property developer!

01:19:58.125 --> 01:20:00.208
I cancelled our show!

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:20.168
Hu Liang!

01:20:20.958 --> 01:20:23.000
What are you doing? Stop fighting!

01:20:28.583 --> 01:20:29.375
Let him go!

01:20:29.418 --> 01:20:30.833
Punch me!

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:27.293
LOOKING FOR LILI

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:52.083
Dad.

01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:53.458
I know.

01:23:56.793 --> 01:23:58.543
Get rid of them.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:13.793
I WANT YOU. JOIN MY BAND.

01:24:30.168 --> 01:24:31.208
So you three

01:24:31.293 --> 01:24:33.043
are going abroad to become traffic lights?

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.043
Sir.

01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:36.375
We're going abroad to be stars.

01:24:36.418 --> 01:24:38.168
Star!

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:39.708
Green light,

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:42.333
I think you'll definitely
be the most famous one.

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:45.458
I love green lights...

01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:47.918
Because I don't want to be stuck here.

01:25:15.918 --> 01:25:18.668
SEWING MACHINE IN CONCERT:
SEPTEMBER 30TH

01:25:19.043 --> 01:25:21.375
JI'AN ROCK'N'ROLL PARK:
THE PERFECT GOODBYE

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:53.543
This is it.

01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:55.293
4,919 yuan.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:36.625
ROCK'N'ROLL HAS DIED

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:52.043
You sick bastard!

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:53.043
Sick bastard!

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:53.833
Damn you!

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:54.418
You sick bastard!

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.250
Want to steal?

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:57.668
I just bought them and
you came here to steal!

01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:59.918
I just bought them and
you came here to steal!

01:27:00.208 --> 01:27:01.333
You like underpants, huh?

01:27:01.375 --> 01:27:03.208
Here you are!

01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:07.500
Come on!

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.625
I want to see your face!

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:31.750
Hu Liang,

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.750
I'm sorry.

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:39.750
Bro,

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:41.750
it's over.

01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:46.458
I finally understand.

01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:50.125
Whether they removed Grand Guitar or not...

01:27:50.168 --> 01:27:52.583
It wasn't up to us...

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.958
It was my fault.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.293
I was too young.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.750
I want to finish our performance

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.625
at the same location and time.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:08.375
Are you in?

01:28:11.418 --> 01:28:13.000
I don't want to sing anymore.

01:28:15.043 --> 01:28:16.875
I mean I can still sing.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:20.833
But I don't know what for?

01:28:21.418 --> 01:28:23.375
The Grand Guitar is gone.

01:28:23.418 --> 01:28:25.125
What I want to do is repair vehicles.

01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:28.168
Listen to me.

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:31.250
You can still do the repairing.

01:28:31.293 --> 01:28:32.918
But you still need to sing.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:36.458
Otherwise, you'll lose
the spirit in your heart.

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:40.833
I had that kind of spirit before.

01:28:41.833 --> 01:28:43.875
Back then the only thing I thought about

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.543
was when I could start each day.

01:28:50.293 --> 01:28:52.583
But now, I've lost it in my heart.

01:28:53.918 --> 01:28:56.625
Now I only think about
when I can end each day.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:01.125
At the time when my heart was in it,

01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:04.043
your bro was a real rocker!

01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:08.043
But without that spirit,

01:29:10.125 --> 01:29:13.333
my head is only full of this stuff!

01:29:16.375 --> 01:29:18.168
But you can't be like this.

01:29:19.458 --> 01:29:21.543
As long as we keep singing,

01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:25.250
the Grand Guitar will still be here.

01:29:29.043 --> 01:29:31.293
Otherwise, it's gone forever.

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:38.918
Are you in?

01:29:45.208 --> 01:29:46.000
Yeah.

01:29:46.043 --> 01:29:47.250
I can't hear you.

01:29:48.043 --> 01:29:49.418
Are you in?

01:29:49.458 --> 01:29:49.875
I'm in.

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:51.208
Louder! Are you in?!

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:51.750
I'm in!

01:29:51.793 --> 01:29:52.458
Are you in?!

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:52.875
I'm in!

01:29:52.918 --> 01:29:53.543
Are you in?!

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:54.293
I'm in!

01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:56.333
- I'm damn in!
- I'm in!

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.125
Xixi,

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.293
come down!

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:35.375
I've seen your videos.

01:30:35.418 --> 01:30:37.418
You don't need to climb
out the window anymore.

01:30:37.458 --> 01:30:38.083
Use the front door.

01:30:38.418 --> 01:30:40.043
Mom...

01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:42.708
wear this on the stage.

01:30:43.958 --> 01:30:46.208
There's a demonstration match
at the taekwondo gymnasium.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.750
I'm going to see your show after that.

01:30:48.793 --> 01:30:49.625
Is that okay?

01:30:49.668 --> 01:30:49.918
Okay.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.208
Li Meiyan!

01:30:53.668 --> 01:30:54.668
Li Meiyan, listen.

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:57.375
Xixi must go to the show today!

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:59.000
- Dad...
- Don't say anything, honey.

01:30:59.043 --> 01:31:01.750
Just remember what your
dad has done for you today!

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:15.668
This is the credit card
you've been looking for.

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.625
That's all?

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.543
Women

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:38.793
are greedy!

01:31:43.418 --> 01:31:45.208
What are you guys looking at?

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.293
Nervous?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:56.958
Well...

01:31:57.043 --> 01:31:57.875
It's quite normal.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.333
Our band was established just a month ago.

01:32:00.375 --> 01:32:02.500
Now, you're performing at a big show.

01:32:02.543 --> 01:32:03.875
You're not the only one.

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.293
We're all nervous.

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:06.418
Right?

01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:08.793
Yep!

01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:11.208
Three of a kind!

01:32:21.833 --> 01:32:23.833
Get out!

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.958
Share the money with our brothers.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.168
Bro,

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:34.043
leave the dirty work to us.

01:32:34.083 --> 01:32:35.000
You can stay inside

01:32:35.043 --> 01:32:37.168
because you're still injured.

01:32:38.708 --> 01:32:40.250
No.

01:32:43.083 --> 01:32:46.543
I need to beat the two assholes
who humiliated Jianguo myself.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.043
Get out!

01:32:50.083 --> 01:32:52.708
Stay inside!

01:32:53.918 --> 01:32:55.833
I'm out! What do you want?

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:58.418
I'm out! Stop screaming!

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:00.208
I'm out! What do you want?

01:33:01.918 --> 01:33:02.793
Hold your tongue!

01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:04.293
Shut up!

01:33:04.333 --> 01:33:05.418
Pay attention!

01:33:06.668 --> 01:33:07.543
Listen to me!

01:33:08.918 --> 01:33:10.168
My respected gangsters,

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:12.833
I understand why you'd want
to hijack a cash truck.

01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:14.708
But why are you hijacking a fire truck?

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:15.918
Your water supply was cut off?

01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:17.750
Just save it.

01:33:17.833 --> 01:33:20.125
I know who you are, horse-face guy.

01:33:20.168 --> 01:33:22.418
Who am I then?

01:33:22.458 --> 01:33:24.293
You're my neighbor.

01:33:24.418 --> 01:33:25.958
I have nothing to do with your fat wife!

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.208
It's the truth.

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:28.293
What fat wife?

01:33:28.333 --> 01:33:30.000
I knocked on their door
without any clothes on last time.

01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:31.000
That yellow dress belongs to her.

01:33:31.043 --> 01:33:32.958
Are you cheating again?

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:34.458
Beat him!

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:36.000
Lock the door!

01:33:45.668 --> 01:33:47.625
That way!

01:34:58.168 --> 01:34:59.333
Where's the water?

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:15.668
Go!

01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:44.875
WE LOVE PEACE

01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:50.375
Don't move!

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.208
The horse-face man is our hostage!

01:35:53.418 --> 01:35:54.418
I'll extinguish him if you get closer!

01:35:54.458 --> 01:35:56.668
Don't move!

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.125
Step back!

01:35:58.250 --> 01:36:00.543
It's stuck in my mouth!

01:36:00.668 --> 01:36:03.458
Step aside!

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.293
You go first!

01:36:06.625 --> 01:36:07.583
Go!

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:08.293
Let's go.

01:36:08.333 --> 01:36:09.208
Let's go.

01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:11.168
Let's get out of here.

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:13.793
I want to see who you really are.

01:36:23.125 --> 01:36:24.208
Run!

01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:54.168
Dad.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.418
Mom.

01:37:15.833 --> 01:37:16.918
Run!

01:37:17.168 --> 01:37:20.000
Today is September 30th.

01:37:20.043 --> 01:37:23.250
Sewing Machine will perform their song

01:37:23.293 --> 01:37:25.418
on the debris at the Rock'n'roll Park.

01:37:25.458 --> 01:37:27.708
Remember who you are, rockers...

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:29.875
Are you guys going cheer them on

01:37:29.918 --> 01:37:31.833
alongside Sweety?

01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:36.168
You guys are here.

01:37:37.958 --> 01:37:39.000
All set?

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:41.293
Yes. Everything is ready.

01:37:42.125 --> 01:37:42.793
Your arm, master...

01:37:42.833 --> 01:37:44.000
I'm okay.

01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:46.250
Listen to me.

01:37:47.625 --> 01:37:49.500
Everything we've been preparing

01:37:49.543 --> 01:37:51.250
is for this very moment.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.083
The Grand Guitar is gone.

01:37:56.333 --> 01:37:58.293
Let's pay our tribute.

01:37:58.333 --> 01:37:59.708
Come on!

01:38:02.375 --> 01:38:03.083
Let's rock'n'roll!

01:38:03.125 --> 01:38:05.750
Sewing Machine!

01:38:49.958 --> 01:38:52.583
One day,

01:38:52.625 --> 01:38:56.625
I'll start my own band,

01:38:56.668 --> 01:39:01.043
and roar out songs for my hometown!

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:09.750
<I've already forgotten where I come from>

01:39:14.125 --> 01:39:21.833
<I've forgotten why I exist>

01:40:05.168 --> 01:40:11.918
<Don't think that I'll just hide away>

01:40:54.208 --> 01:41:03.583
<- Fly me away over your heart>
- Let's rock'n'roll, Sewing Machine!

01:41:26.918 --> 01:41:33.208
<Don't think that I'll just hide away>

01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:15.293

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.875
Today,

01:44:05.125 --> 01:44:07.168
being able to stand on this stage

01:44:09.918 --> 01:44:11.418
is all thanks to one person.

01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:16.750
He's our agent,

01:44:16.793 --> 01:44:18.043
Cheng Gong.

01:44:18.083 --> 01:44:19.250
Bro,

01:44:19.293 --> 01:44:20.833
I am not smart enough

01:44:20.875 --> 01:44:22.333
to know

01:44:23.043 --> 01:44:25.208
what your dream is.

01:44:25.708 --> 01:44:27.333
But today,

01:44:27.375 --> 01:44:29.833
I want you to get on stage

01:44:29.875 --> 01:44:31.043
and sing a song.

01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:38.958
We people of Ji'an are all musicians.

01:44:39.043 --> 01:44:39.833
Today,

01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:41.958
we're going to accompany him,

01:44:42.083 --> 01:44:43.043
all right?

01:44:43.083 --> 01:44:44.583
Okay!

01:44:44.833 --> 01:44:47.125
No more hesitation!

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.418
Come on!

01:45:10.958 --> 01:45:12.458
Come on!

01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:43.250
<I'll just count on these two hands
to lead me to my dreams>

01:46:03.043 --> 01:46:06.543
<I've written out the ups and down>

01:47:18.375 --> 01:47:24.083
<I'll just count on these two hands
to lead me to my dreams>

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.043
<I've written out the ups and down>

01:48:13.875 --> 01:48:15.250
My hometown

01:48:15.293 --> 01:48:18.250
is a beautiful town called Ji'an.

01:48:18.293 --> 01:48:22.043
It's quiet and ordinary.

01:48:22.125 --> 01:48:22.875
But,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.333
because of this band

01:48:25.418 --> 01:48:29.793
dramatic changes took place here.

01:48:34.168 --> 01:48:35.250
Bro,

01:48:35.293 --> 01:48:37.208
if you ever find the time,

01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:40.625
come back to visit us!

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:42.918
OK.

01:48:42.958 --> 01:48:44.625
Make a pinky promise!

01:48:47.875 --> 01:48:49.500
I gotta go.

01:48:49.543 --> 01:48:50.625
Don't be sentimental!

01:49:23.875 --> 01:49:24.668
What are you looking at?

01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:26.583
Give me a hand.

01:49:26.668 --> 01:49:27.583
You are heading to Beijing?

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:28.375
So what?

01:49:28.418 --> 01:49:29.500
I can't be a drifter in Beijing?

01:49:29.543 --> 01:49:31.375
Do I need your permission or what?

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:42.375
From then on,

01:49:42.418 --> 01:49:45.418
this beautiful town of rock'n'roll

01:49:45.458 --> 01:49:47.958
has been full of hope,

01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:51.208

insisting on taking
photos with the audience.

01:51:39.875 --> 01:51:41.333
We could've been here earlier
to have our own celebration party.

01:51:41.583 --> 01:51:42.625
I didn't!

01:51:42.668 --> 01:51:44.958
Old Yang here was taking photos
with a group of women!

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.418
I was only acting.

01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:47.958

01:55:19.875 --> 01:55:21.375

01:55:21.793 --> 01:55:22.750
Hey there, instructor!

01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:26.543
Is this where I'll be teaching dance?

01:55:38.293 --> 01:55:40.543
Bro, do you like this car?

01:55:42.708 --> 01:55:44.708
At least there's a view.

01:55:45.958 --> 01:55:49.958
The looks and performance
are better than normal cars.

01:55:50.583 --> 01:55:53.168
Can you go any faster?

01:55:53.543 --> 01:55:55.083

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.293
How much?

01:56:11.333 --> 01:56:12.208
6, please.

01:56:18.833 --> 01:56:19.833
Be careful. It's hot.

01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:21.043
Thank you.

01:56:24.168 --> 01:56:26.708
Darling, look at that giant guitar.

01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:27.958
Is that wonderful?

01:56:28.958 --> 01:56:31.958
Yeah! That's so cool!
