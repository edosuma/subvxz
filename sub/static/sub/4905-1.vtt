<i>Good morning, I'm Kai Ryssdal.</i>

00:02.420 --> 00:05.923
<i>It is Monday today,
the 15th of September, 2008.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:07.550
<i>And this is going to be
one of those days</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:09.510
<i>that lingers in the mind for awhile.</i>

00:09.594 --> 00:10.928
<i>It's going to come up in conversations</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:12.513
<i>where people say,
"You remember when?"</i>

00:12.597 --> 00:14.432
<i>The closing of California's IndyMac Bank</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:16.350
<i>has resulted in what
could turn out to be</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:18.686
<i>the most costly bank failure
in US history.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:20.897
<i>The DOW has dropped more than 800 points,</i>

00:20.980 --> 00:22.857
<i>and it's not clear
the crisis is over...</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.735
<i>Last night, there was
an emergency meeting in Washington.</i>

00:25.818 --> 00:27.778
<i>The leaders of Congress were told</i>

00:27.862 --> 00:31.782
<i>the Nation's financial system
was facing imminent collapse.</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:35.203

Morning.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.668
Hey.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.048
Hey, do I have any messages?

02:13.551 --> 02:15.177
Wilcox wants to see you.

02:15.261 --> 02:17.763
She's in the fifth floor conference room.

02:17.847 --> 02:20.308
Shot an 86 at the club this morning.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.060
She said it was important.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.771
Sally Wilcox thinks everything's important.
Thank you.

02:34.989 --> 02:38.534
Anyone want to take a guess
at what I shot at the club this morning?

02:38.617 --> 02:39.660
Go ahead, take a shot.

02:39.744 --> 02:42.830
Just... no?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.832
Forty-four in the front,
42 on the back.

02:44.915 --> 02:49.086
Oh, no you didn't, Bob.
Yes, I really did.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.755
It's true.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.798
What happened, somebody die?

02:57.261 --> 02:58.637
Conal?

02:58.721 --> 03:01.390
They closed Mobile and Newport News.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.018
They merged Ship Systems with Rail Products.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.479
- How many?
- Conal, your wife's on one.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.691
<i>With the economy contracting for the first time...</i>

03:10.775 --> 03:13.402
- Hi, honey.
- 3,000 at the ship yards.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.780
Rumor is another couple hundred here.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.866
I've got some bad news.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.541
What's going on?

03:27.625 --> 03:30.419
Bobby, you know Dick Landry from Legal?

03:30.503 --> 03:32.546
The company is consolidating divisions.

03:32.630 --> 03:35.591
Difficult decisions had to be made
in areas where redundancy surfaced.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.135
We have structured a generous
severance package for you.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.388
Your 12 years with us entitles you
to 12 weeks, full pay.

03:40.471 --> 03:41.847
And benefits.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.104
- You're firing me?
- Come on, Bobby. Sit down.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.189
We're also offering you 
outplacement services,

03:50.272 --> 03:51.857
to help you secure your next employment.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.152
- Does Gene know about this?
- Please sit.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.701
You know what, Sally?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.079
Fuck off.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.627
- Is Gene in here?
- He's in Chicago today.

04:13.712 --> 04:17.550
We've reviewed our pipeline
of some 500 projects and programs,

04:17.632 --> 04:20.511
focusing on those with significant
marketing opportunities,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.097
and jettisoning everything
that won't contribute immediately

04:23.180 --> 04:28.060
to our profitability, selecting 37
as promising strategic growth programs

04:28.144 --> 04:30.896
and setting aside the rest
for future consideration.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.731
Ned Haskell, J. P. Morgan.

04:32.815 --> 04:37.194
Mr. McClary, you were talking earlier
about fiscal 2011.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.696
You've done a good job of convincing us

04:38.779 --> 04:40.489
that with the credit markets frozen,

04:40.573 --> 04:43.701
your sales revenue in 2010 will slow.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.494
Great, my job here is done.

04:46.829 --> 04:51.083
Can you talk about 2011 and what sort
of a percentage increase you anticipate?

04:51.167 --> 04:54.503
We all like to talk percentages, Ned,
your people do, our people do.

04:54.587 --> 04:57.298
Are you suggesting that
you aren't expecting

04:57.381 --> 04:59.300
any growth in your division next year?

04:59.383 --> 05:02.845
I'm suggesting that we face
increased foreign competition,

05:02.928 --> 05:06.682
and a difficult credit market
for large capital expenditures like ship building.

05:06.765 --> 05:11.395
So, no growth in 2011?

05:11.854 --> 05:16.192
I am confident that while ship building
will remain challenged,

05:16.275 --> 05:18.611
the rest of the transportation systems group

05:18.694 --> 05:20.404
will continue to make significant

05:20.487 --> 05:25.659
contributions to growth at GTX
in the coming quarters.

05:25.743 --> 05:26.827
Yes, in the back.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.669
Honesty is the best policy?

05:35.753 --> 05:38.839
Christ, could you just try to be
a little less candid for once?

05:38.923 --> 05:41.759
Is lying to financial analysts
our new profitability plan?

05:42.593 --> 05:46.180
What do you want? More inflated guidance
so we can under-perform

05:46.263 --> 05:48.307
in all four quarters again next year?

05:48.390 --> 05:50.017
2011?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.187
I'm worried about our share price tomorrow.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.773
Salinger's gonna blow a fucking gasket.

06:09.694 --> 06:10.746
Shit.

06:12.998 --> 06:17.294
- Yeah.
- They say who else is on the block?

06:18.921 --> 06:20.631
Thanks for the sympathy, Phil.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.097
Call you later? OK?

06:28.180 --> 06:29.306
OK.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.603
Did they say anything about me?

06:34.687 --> 06:35.980
What?

06:36.689 --> 06:38.566
About my still having a job?

06:38.649 --> 06:40.192
You know, I didn't ask.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.924
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

07:37.207 --> 07:38.709
This damn thing's dead.
Recharge it for me, will ya?

07:38.792 --> 07:39.793
Phil's in there.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.714
Make yourself right at home, Phil.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.925
I won't go back to the factory floor.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.219
I've got one kid in college
and another going in the fall.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.472
What the hell are you talking about?

07:52.056 --> 07:53.724
You're shitting me.
He doesn't know?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.893
Sally Wilcox let some more people go.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.270
Some? She fired goddamn everybody.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.647
Did she fire you?

07:59.730 --> 08:01.899
No, but I've been hiding in here all day.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.109
They closed Mobile and Newport News.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.153
Laid off most of the
ship system sales group.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.323
I won't let the bastards
just kick me out after 30 years.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.034
I'll take an AK-47
to this fucking place first.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.378
- ... the compensation...
- What were you gonna do,

08:22.461 --> 08:24.338
let me read about it in tomorrow's <i>Journal</i> ?

08:24.421 --> 08:27.674
- We're in the middle of something here.
- You closed two of my shipyards?

08:27.758 --> 08:30.844
Consolidating divisions has been
under discussion for months.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.221
Yeah, and I told you
it was a shitty idea.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.181
We took that opinion into consideration...

08:34.264 --> 08:35.515
It's my goddamn division!

08:35.599 --> 08:37.142
This is my goddamn company!

08:42.563 --> 08:45.025
Would you excuse us for a moment, please.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.409
You don't embarrass me like that.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.618
Embarrass you?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.037
I'm gone one day and
you gut one of my divisions.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.456
Stock has stalled, revenues are flat.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.625
The entire economy's flat,
we're in the middle of a recession.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.628
I only closed two of the shipyards,
I should've closed all three of them.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.380
Stock is in the fucking toilet.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.132
Everybody's stock is in the toilet.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.552
Well, the stockholders would like to see
their share value maximized.

09:11.935 --> 09:15.098
Well. Sell the fucking Degas.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.230
Well now, I heard you put on
quite a show in Chicago.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.107
What'd you do,
you told a room full of analysts

09:25.190 --> 09:27.359
you weren't going to generate
any growth next year.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.485
Three thousand jobs?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.988
Gene, we're not some
shitty little shipyard anymore.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.574
I'm not gonna keep pouring money
into a losing operation.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.075
We innovate, we retool...

09:35.159 --> 09:38.203
American heavy manufacturing is dead.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.166
Steel, autos, your precious shipbuilding.

09:43.667 --> 09:47.337
The future's in health care infrastructure, 
and power generation.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.508
I have to be involved in any decision
that affects one of my divisions.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.343
You wouldn't have approved the cuts.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.765
You'd go behind my back
to the board again, right?

09:58.891 --> 10:00.184
They were good people, Jim.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.564
They're not our responsibility.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.733
We work for the stockholders now.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.456
- Your dad's home?
- Yeah.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.833
Can you grab the rest of these
out of the trunk?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.089
Hi.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.218
- What are you doing home?
- Makin' dinner.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.054
- We're going over to Jack's.
- That's tonight?

10:39.223 --> 10:40.891
Dierdre's birthday.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.019
- I think it's gonna rain.
- You know what,

10:44.102 --> 10:46.021
you don't want to come, fine.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.064
Don't come.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.066
Thanks, bud.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.204
Drew, can you finish that upstairs, please.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.540
Can you put on
a clean pair of jeans, please.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.084
We're going over to your Uncle Jack's for dinner.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.963
Christ, you don't have to like him,
but you can pretend for my sake.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.048
I mean, he doesn't like you either,
but at least he cares enough about me

11:13.131 --> 11:14.716
not to treat you like a piece of shit.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.176
They fired me.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.264
What?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.184
They fired me. Today.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.855
- Sally Wilcox.
- Why?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.067
Something about redundancies.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.990
- Gene said you were safe.
- Gene said a lot of things.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.325
He was nowhere to be found today.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.494
Bobby, you busted your ass for them...
No, no, I'm sorry.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.956
Fuck them, and fuck Gene McClary,
and all his promises.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.126
Something's burning.

12:05.434 --> 12:09.229
Hey, I... I don't want to tell anybody.

12:09.313 --> 12:13.108
You know, until I get another job.
All right?

12:41.845 --> 12:43.639
Hey, where's your mother?

12:50.520 --> 12:51.772
Hey.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.232
Where's your mom?

12:55.817 --> 12:56.943
Headache.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.199
Oh, Dad.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.493
They announced where we're going
for our senior trip.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.331
Italy.

13:12.924 --> 13:14.169
Boy, that's great.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.462
I can go, right?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.675
Of course, sweetheart.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.912
Phil?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.414
Yeah?

13:51.415 --> 13:52.916
Oh, God.

13:56.044 --> 14:00.924
Ann Doherty called.
They fired Conal.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.678
Are we OK?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.346
Yeah.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.061
- I should get ready.
- For what?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.646
We got Salinger's dinner.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.566
- Oh God, I completely forgot.
- You don't have to come,

14:17.649 --> 14:20.360
- if you're not feeling up to it.
- Just give me a minute.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.612
To put my face on.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.005
<i>Gene?</i>

14:44.176 --> 14:45.886
Gene?

14:45.969 --> 14:49.473
Where've you been?
The car's picking us up in half an hour.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.060
I really don't want
to be late again.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.437
Can we please try not
to be late again?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.152
Stephanie finally found
a table for the window.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.403
I like it.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.281
I'm comin'.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.831
- How are you?
- Good, good.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.374
Hey, guy.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.720
How go the suit wars, Bobby?

16:10.804 --> 16:12.180
All right, Jack.

16:12.264 --> 16:15.600
Move any more high-paying American jobs

16:15.684 --> 16:17.811
offshore to Asian shitholes this week?

16:17.894 --> 16:20.647
Mostly focused on union busting now,
you know how it is.

16:20.730 --> 16:24.943
Surprised you could make it.
No early flight, no golf game?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.238
Those are the usual excuses, aren't they?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.573
Hi, Bobby.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.366
Hey, birthday girl.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.118
I can't believe you're 35.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.744
I mean, you don't look a day over 21.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.414
You see, Jack.
Now that's how it's done.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.624
You're a liar, Bobby.
But I love you for it.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.126
You need to get back to your post,

16:41.209 --> 16:42.544
- barbecue boy.
- All right, all right.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.462
Why don't you grab yourself a drink, Bobby.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.006
We got some margaritas in the blender,

16:46.089 --> 16:47.465
we got some beers out back in the cooler.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.842
Thanks.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.891
I'm open! I'm open!

17:02.105 --> 17:04.482
Nice play action.
Nice play action.

17:04.566 --> 17:09.320
<i>Who better to introduce
this year's Man of the Year Award,</i>

17:09.404 --> 17:12.616
than the man who's known him
longer than anyone else.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.117
Gene McClary is
Executive Vice President of GTX,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.537
Global Transportation Systems.

17:17.621 --> 17:22.791
He's also, I'm told,
one of GTX's first employees.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.729
Gene McClary.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.469
Thank you.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.307
Actually, if memory serves,
I was GTX's only employee at the time.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.729
Nobody wanted Gloucester Shipbuilding.
Years of multi-million dollar losses.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.981
Highest labor costs in the industry.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.192
But from those humble beginnings,

17:47.275 --> 17:49.861
Jim was able to grow Gloucester into GTX,

17:49.945 --> 17:54.658
with 60,000 employees and 11 billion dollars
in gross annual revenue.

18:01.164 --> 18:05.877
So, it is my privilege to introduce my...

18:05.961 --> 18:08.838
oldest friend.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.092
College roommate,
best man at my wedding

18:12.175 --> 18:13.843
and the worst tennis player I ever met.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.181
Ladies and gentlemen,
my boss, Jim Salinger.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.772
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.650
Without a doubt,
you don't build a company like GTX,

18:28.733 --> 18:32.195
without the support and leadership
of men like Gene McClary.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.961
Hi, Robert Walker, GTX.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.213
Down at the end of the hall.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.771
Nice suit.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.817
- Thanks.
- Orientation?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.194
- Yeah.
- That way.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.237
Oh, thanks.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.781
- Do the tiger for me.
- What?

19:16.865 --> 19:19.075
- Down the hall.
- Thanks.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.996
<i>First, let me tell you
what outplacement is not.</i>

19:23.079 --> 19:25.123
<i>We are not an employment agency.</i>

19:25.206 --> 19:28.209
<i>We are here to help you
help yourselves.</i>

19:28.293 --> 19:31.713
Now, you all need to put together
a networking list of all your friends.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.132
That's suppliers, competitors,

19:34.215 --> 19:36.134
people you sat next to at a convention.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.512
Neighbors, dentists.
Anybody and everybody.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.764
You need a new resume.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.392
You're gonna be sending out hundreds
so make it good.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.228
Endings.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.730
We're not used to them.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.024
Fear, anxiety...

19:51.107 --> 19:52.317
loss.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.818
How many of you are feeling these things?

19:57.614 --> 19:58.531
Endings.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.657
Fear.

20:00.992 --> 20:05.288
Change. And finally, success.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.915
OK, everybody up.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.209
Come on, no use sitting around
feeling sorry for ourselves.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.544
Up, up.
This is called the Tiger.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.671
We do it when we need
to get our energy up.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.758
I will win!

20:16.841 --> 20:18.009
Why?

20:18.093 --> 20:21.679
I will show you why,
because I have faith,

20:21.763 --> 20:23.932
courage, enthusiasm.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.351
- Everybody, this time.
- I'm all set.

20:26.434 --> 20:30.021
I will win!

20:30.105 --> 20:35.110
Why? Because I have faith,
courage, enthusiasm. Good.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.445
I will win!

20:37.529 --> 20:38.822
Did Bobby Walker call back?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.074
- Yeah, last night.
- Leave a message?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.367
Not one I'd care to repeat.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.035
See if he can come by for lunch today.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.621
Stocks up six, not bad.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.915
My 401K is all GTX.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.709
This continues,
I may get to retire before I'm 80.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.587
With ship systems
and rail products merging,

20:54.671 --> 20:57.257
we are reassigning sales regions.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.092
How are we doing with Royal Caribbean?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.094
They're nervous.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.847
Don't like seeing us on <i>Bloomberg</i>
every 15 minutes.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
Well, calm them down.
We need that boat.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.851
How are we supposed to cover
the same number of accounts,

21:07.934 --> 21:08.852
with half the staff?

21:08.935 --> 21:11.479
I'm already gone two weeks out of four.
What am I supposed to tell my kids?

21:11.563 --> 21:14.274
Tell them you're lucky
you still have a job.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.942
Inactive accounts.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.485
I want to know what we're going to do
to get the business back.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.696
Client by client.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.415
- It's taken.
- All right.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.499
Hey.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.962
- Come in here.
- Thanks.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.715
Appreciate it.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.011
- Friendly bunch.
- You are the enemy.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.138
Another warm body
they got to claw their way over

21:45.221 --> 21:46.806
to get back to the corporate feed trough.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.726
- Yet you're not threatened.
- I'm a very secure individual.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.603
Besides you do not look like an engineer.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.731
- MBA?
- Yeah.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.151
If you knew your way around
a guided missile system,

21:58.234 --> 22:00.069
I'd have to shove an ice pick
in the base of your skull.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.113
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Your previous employer

22:02.197 --> 22:05.867
has spared no expense.
Fax machine, Xerox, coffee.

22:06.910 --> 22:07.994
How was orientation?

22:08.077 --> 22:09.495
I felt like someone
was going to shave my head

22:09.579 --> 22:10.830
and make me beat a drum.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.083
What... What do you got to do

22:14.167 --> 22:15.627
to get yourself
in one of those offices?

22:15.710 --> 22:18.171
Your company has to pay extra
for one of those.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.173
Exec VPs and above mostly.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.884
Corner one has a Eastman-Kodak CFO in it.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.137
How long they give you?

22:26.221 --> 22:28.348
Three months full salary,
four months outplacement.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.559
- How about you?
- Nine months of both.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.144
Been here four.

22:33.228 --> 22:36.147
I don't think it'll take me
more than a few days.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.440
No offense.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.236
None taken.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.909
Sorry I'm late.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.871
- How you holding up?
- Good.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.166
- Maggie all right?
- Yeah. She's great, we're fine.

22:56.459 --> 22:57.919
Glenlivet, rocks.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.008
It wasn't my call, Bobby.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.638
Salinger's under a lot of pressure
to boost the stock price

23:08.721 --> 23:11.516
before somebody buys in
and makes him break up the company.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.353
We'll lose a lot more jobs in a merger
than we have in this downsizing.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.814
You trying to appeal to my sense
of the greater corporate good?

23:18.731 --> 23:20.233
I've been calling in some markers.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.695
Tom Borden over at Lockheed,
Pat Leahy at Raytheon,

23:23.778 --> 23:25.822
you'll recognize most of them.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.871
Come on, let's get something to eat.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.666
I lost my appetite.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.461
Take the names, Bobby.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.338
Don't bother reassigning my accounts.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.507
I'm gonna steal them back
when I get a job with your competition.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.026
- Hey!
- Hey.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.952
- Hey!
- Hey.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.288
- How'd it go?
- Great.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.831
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.333
- All right.
- Lunch with Gene,

24:18.416 --> 24:19.834
he gave me some names.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.378
That's big of him.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.797
I mean, he didn't have
to do anything, you know?

24:24.881 --> 24:27.508
- Yeah.
- What is all this?

24:28.592 --> 24:31.137
Our mortgage is resetting next month.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.640
With that and paying off the orthodontist,

24:34.724 --> 24:36.309
and last summer's Disney World trip,

24:36.392 --> 24:37.727
we don't have much
of a cushion left.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.020
I don't need a cushion.

24:40.521 --> 24:44.609
Your Porsche payments,
the credit cards, Patriots tickets?

24:44.692 --> 24:47.153
I told you I'm splitting
the Pats tickets with Darryl this year.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.406
OK, well, just eating out
and doing the damn dry cleaning

24:50.490 --> 24:52.158
is costing us 600 bucks a month.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.619
I was thinking maybe
I could go back to work.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.622
Not full-time,
just a few shifts a week.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.499
No.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.251
3M needs a new General Sales Manager.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.837
I can call up Brian Collins,
and have breakfast with him next week.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.381
OK, well we're gonna need to cut back.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.758
Cancel skiing at Christmas,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.176
stop paying the club dues for awhile.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.553
If things get really bad,
I can bag groceries.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.514
- I can be on the corner...
- Don't be a jerk, OK? Just...

25:16.974 --> 25:20.228
No more big purchases.
Just eat at home more.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.689
Hello?

25:24.732 --> 25:26.776
Hey, Kevin. Yeah?

25:27.443 --> 25:28.945
Yeah, let me get him for you.
He's right here.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.113
What?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.697
He read about the layoffs in the paper.

25:31.781 --> 25:34.200
- So what?
- You gonna tell him?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.327
No, I'm not gonna tell him,
because I don't need a lecture

25:36.411 --> 25:38.496
on parental responsibility right now.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.129
Hey, Dad, what's going on?
Oh, that?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.381
That's all manufactured.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.759
They're trying to offer me a CEO job.
I had to turn them down.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.680
I come bearing gifts.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.515
Glenfiddich, 40 year old.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.392
- Single malt.
- Nice.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.644
Yeah, it better be.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.313
Strick sent it over.
That bastard.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.404
- That's Alaska.
- Yeah.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.490
Goddamn it, Gene.
Those were good times.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.075
The best.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.664
Well, you and Cynthia
thinking about joining us

26:21.747 --> 26:24.500
at Sun Valley for New Years
again this year?

26:24.584 --> 26:26.711
I don't know if we can,
Liam's been talking about

26:26.794 --> 26:29.589
coming home for Christmas
with Susan and the kids.

26:29.972 --> 26:31.340
Hell, bring them along, Grandpa.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.426
Kay'd probably think
she'd died and gone to heaven

26:33.509 --> 26:34.677
with a bunch of kids running around.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.685
Can't have you challenging me
in front of senior staff.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.188
They respect ya. Question my judgment,

26:45.271 --> 26:46.939
you undermine my authority.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.694
I need to know,
can I count on your full support?

26:56.616 --> 26:57.867
Good.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.175
You OK?

27:16.761 --> 27:18.554
I had lunch with Bobby Walker today.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.890
I thought he was gonna
throw a drink in my face.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.518
You were his boss, Gene.
Not his father.

27:27.271 --> 27:30.483
Sue and I are thinking of
sneaking down to Palm Beach

27:30.566 --> 27:32.318
for a weekend.
Later on this month.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.237
You know, some shopping, some golf.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.905
Think you could get us
one of the corporate jets?

27:41.244 --> 27:43.913
Fine. We'll fly commercial.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.626
Stock closed up two today.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.170
My options are worth
a half a million dollars more

27:51.254 --> 27:53.297
than when I woke up this morning.

28:13.249 --> 28:16.237
Need me to stay, Mr. Woodward?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.240
No thanks Nan.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.369
We'll see you tomorrow.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.180
Don't even think
about eating all the candy

29:24.263 --> 29:26.891
you get at school.
Three pieces, that's it.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.986
You look disgusting, you know that?

29:34.065 --> 29:38.110
So, I called Bridget,
and made an appointment.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.987
- Who?
- The realtor.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.034
I think we should at least list it.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.202
See if we get any offers.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.870
We're not gonna sell the house.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.747
We don't need to accept an offer,
but with the market so bad,

29:49.830 --> 29:52.291
it may take us awhile
to sell it, you know?

29:52.375 --> 29:53.542
If we get stuck.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.128
We're not gonna get stuck.

30:00.925 --> 30:04.387
- How do I look?
- Highly employable.

30:08.849 --> 30:09.850
OK.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.480
Bridget?

30:16.732 --> 30:20.027
C'mon. We're not gonna sell the house.

30:20.111 --> 30:23.197
- Have a good day.
- OK.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.286
<i>Treasury Secretary Paulson this morning</i>

30:29.370 --> 30:30.997
<i>announced that the Bush Administration
is about to</i>

30:31.080 --> 30:32.915
<i>inject billions of dollars
into the banks</i>

30:32.998 --> 30:34.542
<i>as a part of the
financial rescue strategy...</i>

30:34.825 --> 30:35.960
All right, great.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.129
Give me a call next week,
I should have an answer for you.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.631
- All right, who's next?
- Mr. Walker.

30:40.715 --> 30:44.010
Mr. Walker? Joyce Robinson,
sorry to keep you waiting.

30:45.693 --> 30:47.680
Mind if I have something to eat here,

30:47.763 --> 30:49.932
I have another meeting right after you.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.100
Go right ahead.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.477
So, it looks like
you worked at GTX for 12 years.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.771
I did. Divisional sales leader
for three of those years.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.733
Surprised they let you go.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.986
- You and me both.
- Have you handled regional sales?

31:02.069 --> 31:05.114
I came up in regional sales.
I worked for Martin-Marietta in California.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.868
Well, we're looking to expand in the south.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.161
We need someone in Little Rock.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.788
In Arkansas?

31:12.872 --> 31:14.915
Is relocation a problem?

31:15.499 --> 31:19.253
No, no.
I had hoped to stay here,

31:19.336 --> 31:20.880
because I'm from the area...

31:20.963 --> 31:25.051
You left the salary space blank
on your application.

31:25.134 --> 31:30.055
Well... you know.
That's a negotiation.

31:30.139 --> 31:33.476
I was making 120 at GTX plus incentives.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.894
But I know times are different now.

31:34.977 --> 31:38.606
And I'd be willing to accept 110,
and hope for bonuses.

31:38.689 --> 31:41.901
Well, our base salary is 65,000 a year

31:41.984 --> 31:43.444
for regional sales directors.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.407
I, I responded to an ad
for the Vice President of Marketing.

31:48.491 --> 31:52.036
Well, we've had a number
of highly qualified applicants for that position.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.789
I'm a highly qualified applicant
for that position.

31:57.708 --> 32:01.420
I'm a highly qualified applicant
for that position.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.925
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.719
I must've had too many cups of coffee
while I was

32:08.803 --> 32:10.638
sitting in your fucking waiting room
for two hours.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.599
Thanks for your time, Joyce.
Just between the two of us?

32:13.682 --> 32:15.184
You can probably skip the Diet Cokes.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.436
They're not helping you.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.105
Jim's worried, thinks we're a target.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.209
Who can get together that kind of money
in the middle of a recession?

32:23.692 --> 32:24.610
It's what he does.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.445
Then what? He splits us up?

32:26.529 --> 32:29.698
Sell off the healthcare unit,
rail products, close Glosterne.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.492
He'll still have consumer electronics

32:31.575 --> 32:33.119
and the turbine and defense departments.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.622
We're a bargain.
Hell, one more quarter

32:36.705 --> 32:38.749
and Lipton will be able
to put together enough votes

32:38.833 --> 32:42.378
to wage a proxy battle
and install his own damn board.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.673
Jim's not gonna give up
without a fight though.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.383
I'm sure he's already
got somebody out there

32:47.466 --> 32:49.385
looking for a white knight.
Keats, maybe Roberts?

32:49.468 --> 32:52.179
Somebody with deep pockets.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.183
- What?
- Nothing.

32:58.227 --> 33:02.898
Tell me more about capital depreciations
of manufacturing...

33:08.904 --> 33:10.156
Shit.

33:11.782 --> 33:15.828
It's my office.
I have the senior staff at 3:30.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.247
- Reschedule.
- I can't.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.498
How about lunch again next Tuesday?

33:19.582 --> 33:21.083
I don't think so.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.964
Maybe.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.048
Bye.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.125
Hi, Jonas Gall, please.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.295
Robert Walker.
Nope. Doesn't know me.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.964
Mike Talbet recommended me from Unicor.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.010
He said that Mr. Geller may have
an opening for a senior sales associate.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.471
OK. That's too bad.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.764
It's OK. Not the first time
I've heard it.

34:17.848 --> 34:18.974
All right, bye.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.726
Sixty-five dollars an hour
for oil rig workers

34:21.810 --> 34:24.103
in the North Atlantic.
Another thousand a week

34:24.188 --> 34:26.607
if you got your commercial
deep sea certification.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.025
Doesn't everybody?

34:28.108 --> 34:29.443
I got mine last year at the Y.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.110
Six of clubs on the seven of hearts.

34:31.195 --> 34:32.780
Sally Wilcox, please.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.991
Construction, hazardous waste removal,
aircraft mechanic.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.985
Thank God I got my doctorate.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.161
Hey, is she in?
It's Bob Walker calling.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.330
He's calling her again.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.331
Hi, Sally. Bob Walker.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.001
Thanks for not returning
any of my phone calls.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.088
If you do return my call,
I would love to know why you fired me

34:49.170 --> 34:51.465
without any notice,
you fucking cowardly bitch.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.428
Gee, I wonder why she never calls you back.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.723
Feels good though. God.

34:59.807 --> 35:02.017
You know what I think?

35:02.101 --> 35:04.770
- It's quitting time.
- Quitting time?

35:04.853 --> 35:06.563
It's 3:30.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.482
A man can only take so much rejection.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.526
I'm thirsty, who's coming?

35:10.609 --> 35:11.860
- Conal?
- Sure, why not?

35:11.944 --> 35:13.445
I'm in.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.781
All right, why not?

35:17.116 --> 35:20.327
I know if you two are going,

35:20.411 --> 35:22.121
it's gonna be good.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.081
For how much?

35:24.164 --> 35:27.042
SEC filing says 3.8 percent.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.962
- Hard hats, gentlemen.
- He's just trying to boost our stock.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.630
He gets it up ten a share,
he walks away with

35:31.714 --> 35:33.674
a couple hundred million in profit.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.803
Lipton wants more
than a couple hundred million.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.263
He wants the company.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.557
Well, our share price
is still too low.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.226
It's making us a very tempting target.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.396
Paul, your office is over there.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.106
- Whole floor Legal?
- No.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.649
This is just for the five of us.

35:50.733 --> 35:54.153
CFO's office, David, Noah.
You are over here.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.905
Conference rooms, private dining room.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.574
Bathrooms and showers.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.700
Gym and kitchen.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.410
Gene, come here.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.497
This is you.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.044
Well, don't get too excited.
My office is gonna be much bigger.

36:11.754 --> 36:13.338
What do you think?

36:13.422 --> 36:14.506
- It's beautiful.
- This is amazing.

36:14.590 --> 36:17.176
Travertine. Floor to ceiling glass.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.595
If you look that way you can see
all the way to Boston.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.082
Hey. Help me.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.459
- Help you? You need help?
- Yeah.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.962
- How you doing?
- You smell like a brewery.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.465
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.717
What's Drew doing?

36:58.801 --> 37:01.512
- Waiting for you.
- Me? Why?

37:03.305 --> 37:04.681
He's worried about you.

37:18.612 --> 37:21.406
- OK, dude, but wait up.
- OK.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.580
What's going on out here, bud?

37:31.500 --> 37:34.586
I'm not a baby.
I can handle stuff.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.862
I lost my job.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.409
What did you think it was?

38:05.492 --> 38:07.536
You and mom, maybe.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.707
Me and mom are all right.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.377
You'll get another one, right?

38:16.378 --> 38:17.379
Yeah.

38:19.339 --> 38:24.136
Hey. You don't have
to worry about me. OK?

38:24.219 --> 38:25.721
Hey, look at me.

38:28.140 --> 38:31.727
You don't have to worry about me.
All right? I'm your dad.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.149
You understand me?

38:37.232 --> 38:38.901
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

38:38.984 --> 38:40.861
<i>Billionaire investor Arthur Lipton today</i>

38:40.944 --> 38:43.572
<i>stepped up his campaign
for changes at GTX,</i>

38:43.655 --> 38:45.365
<i>issuing a letter to shareholders accusing</i>

38:45.449 --> 38:46.992
<i>executives of mismanagement...</i>

38:47.075 --> 38:48.368
What does it all mean?

38:48.452 --> 38:49.786
Nothing good.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.333
Need something, Phil?

38:56.335 --> 38:58.003
We lost Royal Caribbean.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.438
Do we have any cranberry jelly?

39:16.522 --> 39:18.148
Carson, round up your cousins...

39:18.232 --> 39:19.274
Let me help you with that, Fran.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.442
Thank you.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.818
Boys, wash your hands,
wipe your feet.

39:23.779 --> 39:24.821
Beautiful.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.532
How's business, Jack?

39:26.615 --> 39:30.160
Business. Well, we got a
big renovation in Roxbury,

39:30.244 --> 39:31.954
next to the house I did last year.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.831
Nice bonus, when I finish by September.

39:34.915 --> 39:37.960
- If you finish by September.
- By September.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.212
Whenever you're ready to plumb the place,
give me a call.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.713
I got a special on Kohler.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.382
Good.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.551
- How's work, Bobby?
- Good, Jack.

39:46.635 --> 39:49.805
Line up more dollar a day
Laotian preschoolers to

39:49.888 --> 39:52.057
stitch tennis shoes for you in Bangkok?

39:53.475 --> 39:54.977
I'm in manufacturing, Jack.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.354
The dollar-a-day Laotian preschoolers
aren't tall enough

39:57.437 --> 40:00.190
to turn the screws on
the diesel engines, so no.

40:01.650 --> 40:04.528
You know I was reading about your guy Salinger
in the Globe the other day.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.530
Do you read now? Good.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.323
Very small words.

40:08.407 --> 40:12.995
Said he... he made 700 times
what the average GTX worker made last year.

40:15.205 --> 40:18.041
What do you think?
Salinger working 700 times harder

40:18.125 --> 40:21.962
than the welder pounding hot rivets
into a tanker hull all day?

40:22.045 --> 40:23.880
Why don't we say grace
so the kids can start?

40:26.049 --> 40:29.386
OK, Carson?
Would you do the honors?

40:30.512 --> 40:33.098
Dear God.
Thank you for the food

40:33.181 --> 40:35.600
and for letting us
be together on Thanksgiving.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.686
And for everybody being OK.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.813
And please help my Dad find a job.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.317
So he won't be unhappy all the time.
Amen.

40:46.194 --> 40:47.571
OK.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.451
- Want some wine?
- It's a nice table, Fran.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.536
Thank you.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.548
You know if things get tough,
I could...

41:06.631 --> 41:08.717
I could always use some
extra help this winter.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.553
Hanging drywall?

41:11.637 --> 41:12.804
Yeah, it'd be lots of work.

41:12.888 --> 41:16.308
4000 square feet, we're gutting the place.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.602
Thanks, Jack. I don't...

41:18.685 --> 41:21.480
exactly see myself
pounding nails though.

41:21.563 --> 41:24.441
You know? Appreciate it.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.285
Your husband is such a dick.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.335
<i>Goldman Sachs is doing
due diligence for Lipton.</i>

41:43.418 --> 41:46.088
Skadden Arps is snooping around for somebody,

41:46.171 --> 41:49.049
maybe Allied, maybe Simonov's Baltic Global,
out of Moscow.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.676
What's the top price Bater'll pay?

41:50.759 --> 41:52.511
Well, Lipton put the market value at 100.

41:52.594 --> 41:54.471
All right, so we need to
get the stock to 102.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.974
That's 17 more a share.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.601
Yeah, I can add, Noah.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.520
We're already in danger
of missing our quarterly.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.855
We start fooling around
and miss our numbers again, we're...

42:03.939 --> 42:05.524
No, we don't need to get the stock to 100,

42:05.607 --> 42:08.235
we get it in the mid-90's,
it'll show a positive trend.

42:08.318 --> 42:11.446
How are we supposed to boost
the share price again?

42:14.950 --> 42:16.785
Increased efficiencies, lowering costs.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.120
More downsizing.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.913
Suppose we try that stunt again
and the stock stalls...

42:19.996 --> 42:21.706
Increasing market value isn't a stunt.

42:21.790 --> 42:23.333
We should at least consider alternatives.

42:23.417 --> 42:24.918
How about selling the healthcare group?

42:25.001 --> 42:26.086
What?

42:26.169 --> 42:28.839
- Maybe Lipton's right.
- Gene, come on.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.841
Healthcare's the only division
that's exhibiting any growth.

42:30.924 --> 42:33.552
I'm not breaking up the company.

42:33.635 --> 42:34.970
All right.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.389
How about selling the new headquarters building?

42:37.472 --> 42:38.890
We're going to need that space.

42:38.974 --> 42:41.143
Not if we keep firing people, we're not.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.770
I'm not selling the new building!

42:51.945 --> 42:55.031
Get a hold of Human Resources,
have them start making up a list

42:55.115 --> 42:56.450
for another round of downsizing.

43:01.705 --> 43:03.123
Wait a minute, Jim.

43:04.374 --> 43:06.168
Could you guys give us a minute?

43:09.838 --> 43:12.299
What do you want me to do,
parrot back everything you say?

43:12.382 --> 43:17.053
I've always told you what I thought,
right or wrong. And this... is wrong.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.805
I'm late for a meeting.

43:18.889 --> 43:22.934
<i>We're not gonna be able
to make the mortgage next month.</i>

43:25.687 --> 43:27.564
I talked to Bridget.

43:27.647 --> 43:31.276
She thinks if we price the house low enough

43:31.359 --> 43:34.529
we might be able to get
as much as 850,000 for it.

43:38.492 --> 43:40.243
That's less than we got in it.

43:41.870 --> 43:44.873
Yeah, it doesn't matter
how much we got in it.

43:46.333 --> 43:48.168
Your severance ends in three weeks.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.671
We're gonna end up in foreclosure.

43:51.755 --> 43:54.508
We won't have enough money
to put down on another house.

43:56.176 --> 43:57.302
We're not gonna be able to qualify

43:57.385 --> 43:59.763
for another house
on just my salary anyway.

44:01.223 --> 44:04.893
Well, OK. Where are we gonna end up?

44:05.393 --> 44:07.103
Gonna pitch a tent in the park?

44:07.187 --> 44:08.939
- Yeah.
- OK.

44:12.609 --> 44:15.403
We could move in with your folks.

44:15.487 --> 44:18.698
- No.
- They have two extra bedrooms.

44:18.782 --> 44:21.159
Maggie, we're not living with my parents.

44:21.243 --> 44:24.287
It'd just be temporary.

44:24.371 --> 44:28.250
I'd choose death. I opt for death.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.460
No, I'd have to kill myself first.

44:34.256 --> 44:36.007
Jack said he offered you a job the other day

44:36.091 --> 44:37.759
and you shot him down pretty hard.

44:37.842 --> 44:41.805
Can you imagine that?
Me working for your brother.

44:44.766 --> 44:47.269
He was just trying to help.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.229
How, by letting me hang drywall?

44:49.312 --> 44:51.857
You'd get back into great shape.

44:51.940 --> 44:55.986
Calluses. A tan.

44:56.069 --> 44:59.990
- In the middle of winter.
- Yeah, big broad shoulders

45:00.073 --> 45:04.160
from carrying all that heavy lumber.

45:04.244 --> 45:06.121
I gotta get up early, babe.

45:12.002 --> 45:13.295
OK?

45:24.472 --> 45:27.309
Bobby Walker keeps leaving me messages.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.562
My assistant thinks he's psychotic.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.564
She wants to get a restraining order.

45:32.647 --> 45:34.316
I'm sure you've gotten worse.

45:38.278 --> 45:39.738
So, what do you think?

45:39.821 --> 45:42.907
You gonna get away for a day or two
for skiing at Christmas?

45:42.991 --> 45:45.035
I don't know, we'll have to see.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.496
Hansen get you started
on that new list yet?

45:51.875 --> 45:56.171
- I was at the meeting, Sally.
- Yesterday.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.174
How many? How many?

45:59.257 --> 46:00.675
5,000.

46:02.010 --> 46:04.888
Well, what is the criteria
for getting canned this time?

46:04.971 --> 46:08.016
Gary Hunt's put on a few pounds,
maybe we should let him go.

46:08.099 --> 46:11.019
And I hear Jill Carter has cancer.

46:11.102 --> 46:14.290
We could save a bundle
on her insurance premiums.

46:18.318 --> 46:19.319
Sally.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.284
Billionaire Boy's Club.

46:26.668 --> 46:28.036
How's the plotting going?

46:28.119 --> 46:30.914
Warren Buffet still safe
on top of the Fortune 500 list?

46:30.997 --> 46:32.290
How's the job search going, Bobby?

46:32.374 --> 46:33.875
Good actually, real good.
They're out there.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.127
Mr. Connors, your group's on the first tee.

46:36.211 --> 46:38.421
- Ready to get your ass kicked, Eric?
- Let's golf.

46:38.505 --> 46:40.382
Mr. Walker.

46:40.465 --> 46:41.925
May I speak to you for a moment?

46:46.221 --> 46:47.972
Hey.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.849
What the hell's going on?

46:49.933 --> 46:51.351
I just got thrown off
the course at the club.

46:51.434 --> 46:52.435
All right, keep your voice down.

46:52.519 --> 46:54.562
We haven't paid the dues since October?

46:54.646 --> 46:56.481
Yeah, I've paid a lot of things.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.274
I look like a fucking deadbeat.

47:00.443 --> 47:03.822
This is real, Bobby, OK?
This is happening to us.

47:03.905 --> 47:06.700
You are wandering around like
you're in some sort of a daze,

47:06.783 --> 47:09.703
but you're playing golf?
Getting your Porsche detailed?

47:09.786 --> 47:15.000
Maggie, I need to look successful. OK?

47:15.083 --> 47:17.669
I can't just look like
another asshole with a resume.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.755
You are just another asshole with a resume!

47:26.428 --> 47:27.721
I cut them a check for the balance.

47:27.804 --> 47:30.140
- Cancel it.
- No.

47:33.226 --> 47:34.602
We can't afford it.

47:34.686 --> 47:35.812
No.

48:04.049 --> 48:05.967
I should have been honest
with you about the club,

48:06.051 --> 48:08.011
but you haven't been honest with me.

48:08.094 --> 48:11.014
We're not gonna need these, are we?

48:11.097 --> 48:12.766
Maybe we could have
a little rummage sale.

48:12.849 --> 48:14.559
You need to get a job.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.312
Any job.

48:20.482 --> 48:22.108
I can't do this alone, Bobby.

48:22.192 --> 48:23.777
I know. I'm out there playing golf.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.528
In two weeks,
I won't be able to support my family.

48:25.612 --> 48:27.655
Things are gonna get great again.

48:27.739 --> 48:29.574
- No.
- We can get through this.

48:29.657 --> 48:33.369
Things aren't gonna be great again. OK?

48:33.453 --> 48:35.080
I'm trying to get a job.

48:35.163 --> 48:37.624
I've been out there every day,

48:37.707 --> 48:40.835
for three months, trying to get a job.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.463
I haven't had one offer.

48:43.546 --> 48:45.882
- I know.
- I've been to everybody we know.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.509
And a lot of people I don't.

48:47.592 --> 48:52.180
And I have begged, I've fucking begged.

48:52.263 --> 48:54.682
For a lead, anything.

48:55.725 --> 48:58.269
There's thousands of new MBAs out there.

48:58.353 --> 49:02.941
No mortgage, no kids.
Work 90 hour work weeks, for nothing.

49:03.024 --> 49:04.692
You want honesty, Maggie?

49:04.776 --> 49:07.737
I'm a 37 year old unemployed loser,

49:07.821 --> 49:09.989
who can't support his family.

49:10.073 --> 49:13.451
OK, look. You are gonna find a job.

49:13.535 --> 49:17.789
Working for people who know
how lucky they are to have you.

49:17.872 --> 49:19.499
When did it all go to shit?

49:19.582 --> 49:22.961
It hasn't turned to shit.
You have Drew and Carson.

49:23.044 --> 49:25.463
Your parents, and me.

49:27.132 --> 49:29.259
OK, you have me.

49:42.939 --> 49:44.816
We're still at least 75 short.

49:44.899 --> 49:47.694
What about Debra Hayes,
Senior Director of Accounting, Maritime Sales.

49:47.777 --> 49:49.737
Debra Hayes has 10 years with the company,

49:49.821 --> 49:51.406
and outstanding evaluations.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.741
She also has a husband
with a successful law practice.

49:53.825 --> 49:55.869
And two kids who would be delighted
to have mommy at home.

49:55.952 --> 49:57.996
She's 60, I doubt her kids
are still living at home,

49:58.079 --> 49:59.622
much less calling her mommy.

49:59.706 --> 50:02.375
Phil Woodward's back on this list.

50:02.458 --> 50:05.378
- He fits the criteria.
- Wasn't talking to you, Dick.

50:05.461 --> 50:06.963
He's grossly overpaid and just blew...

50:07.046 --> 50:10.175
- What are you, deaf? Shut the fuck up!
- The list is still preliminary, Gene.

50:10.258 --> 50:12.468
I'm looking and all I see
are people over 50

50:12.552 --> 50:15.054
with enough young ones thrown in
to protect us against litigation.

50:15.138 --> 50:18.933
I'm confident all of these dismissals
will stand up to outside legal scrutiny.

50:19.017 --> 50:20.810
What about ethical scrutiny?

50:20.894 --> 50:23.313
We're not breaking any laws, Gene.

50:23.396 --> 50:26.482
I guess I always assumed we were

50:26.566 --> 50:30.278
trying for a higher standard than that, Paul.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.462
Mr. Walker.

50:47.545 --> 50:49.339
Fred Thayer.

50:49.422 --> 50:51.299
Have a seat.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.176
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Sure.

50:54.177 --> 50:55.261
A GTX casualty.

50:55.345 --> 50:57.889
- Yeah.
- How you holding up?

50:57.972 --> 50:59.891
Good, thanks.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.393
Well, Dan Mass gave you
a great recommendation.

51:02.477 --> 51:05.271
MBA, you went to school at State College.

51:05.355 --> 51:07.565
- Undergrad. Yeah.
- My wife went to Penn.

51:07.649 --> 51:09.150
- Really?
- Loved it.

51:10.485 --> 51:13.613
Are you... willing to work for 90 a year,

51:13.696 --> 51:17.992
- plus commission and bonus?
- Yeah.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.995
Good news is we're growing fast,
and there's plenty of head room around here.

51:22.330 --> 51:23.873
So, I can't promise you anything.

51:23.957 --> 51:25.416
But with Dan's recommendation,

51:25.500 --> 51:27.669
and your resume, you seem
like the right fit for the job.

51:27.752 --> 51:30.004
Thanks.

51:34.082 --> 51:35.176
Who's winning?

51:35.260 --> 51:37.262
Who knows. How'd it go?

51:37.345 --> 51:41.015
- The interview?
- It's good. It's good.

51:42.892 --> 51:44.310
Come on, we're all getting
our asses kicked here.

51:44.394 --> 51:46.479
Yeah, you can take my place.

51:46.562 --> 51:48.314
Blue 32, hut!

52:10.837 --> 52:14.298
Robert Walker calling for Troy Thayer, please.

52:14.382 --> 52:15.550
No problem.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.261
Bob Walker for Troy Thayer.

52:21.121 --> 52:22.390
That's OK.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.518
I'm actually just calling
in regards to a position.

52:28.261 --> 52:31.899
Sure. Northeast Regional Sales Manager.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.593
It has.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.538
Thank you very much.

53:01.054 --> 53:02.096
What's that?

53:02.180 --> 53:04.098
My last paycheck.

53:48.726 --> 53:51.437
This guy comes babbling
on and on and on.

53:51.521 --> 53:53.314
You were at a banquet
with nine meat soup?

53:53.397 --> 53:55.316
Yeah, I didn't know
they had nine meats in China.

53:55.399 --> 53:57.568
- I didn't either, can you name them?
- Well there was beef,

53:57.652 --> 53:59.487
- pork, chicken, shark fin...
- Gene?

53:59.570 --> 54:01.864
- Hey Phil, grab a drink.
- Gene.

54:01.948 --> 54:03.658
Relax Phil, grab a drink.
Man, it's a party.

54:03.741 --> 54:06.536
Sally Wilcox just fired me.

54:09.831 --> 54:12.208
Find Sally Wilcox, tell her
to get her ass up here right now.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.709
She's already in your office.

54:23.678 --> 54:25.805
You fired Phil Woodward.

54:25.888 --> 54:27.515
- Hire him back.
- Gene...

54:27.598 --> 54:29.392
Goddamn it, Sally, we talked about this.

54:29.475 --> 54:30.852
Gene.

55:03.551 --> 55:04.969
You too?

55:13.611 --> 55:15.021
Fuck 'em.

55:20.276 --> 55:22.528
They think this is tough.

55:26.324 --> 55:29.202
I worked hull assembly at Gloucester,
remember, Gene?

55:33.247 --> 55:37.043
Try spot welding inside
a 36 inch propeller shaft,

55:37.126 --> 55:39.420
60 hours a week.

56:13.246 --> 56:14.455
Gene?

56:22.755 --> 56:23.756
Gene!

57:06.924 --> 57:08.843
Bobby. Bobby.

57:19.020 --> 57:22.481
You will never guess
who's in Joanna's office.

57:22.565 --> 57:26.319
Gene McClary's favorite ass-kisser.
Phil Woodward.

57:27.737 --> 57:29.739
<i>Your resume's very impressive, Phil.</i>

57:29.822 --> 57:31.532
Thank you. Thanks.

57:31.616 --> 57:34.619
You started on the factory floor,
not many people can claim that anymore.

57:36.287 --> 57:40.374
You want to get rid of all
the ancient stuff, anything pre-90's.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.711
Instead of listing the number of years
you held each position at GTX,

57:43.794 --> 57:45.463
indicate your title and responsibilities.

57:45.546 --> 57:48.799
And here, where you've noted
your military service,

57:48.883 --> 57:49.884
don't say Vietnam.

57:49.967 --> 57:52.470
Combat infantryman is impressive enough.

57:54.096 --> 57:55.473
You smoke, Phil?

57:56.557 --> 57:58.642
- Occasionally.
- Quit.

57:58.726 --> 58:00.436
Employers don't want employee health problems

58:00.519 --> 58:02.521
ratcheting up their insurance premiums, Phil.

58:02.605 --> 58:04.190
You may want to think
about dying your hair,

58:04.273 --> 58:05.816
get rid of some of that grey.

58:05.900 --> 58:09.487
- Do we know each other?
- Excuse me?

58:09.570 --> 58:12.365
You keep using my first name.

58:14.909 --> 58:17.036
I'm not the enemy, Phil.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.497
You're pushing 60,
and you look like hell.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.582
You're going to have
a rough time out there.

58:33.552 --> 58:38.015
Could you show me to my office, please?

58:44.105 --> 58:45.689
You got a window.

58:45.773 --> 58:48.109
Company had to pay extra for that.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.902
The least the pricks could do.

58:53.406 --> 58:56.033
So how's the best damn salesman
on the East Coast?

58:57.034 --> 58:58.536
Unemployed.

58:58.619 --> 59:00.788
Yeah, a lot of that going around.

59:05.126 --> 59:07.670
Dress code pretty lax around here?

59:09.338 --> 59:11.215
You should see casual Fridays.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.721
Hello? Yeah.

59:17.805 --> 59:19.765
I talked to somebody else
from your company last week,

59:19.849 --> 59:20.891
and they said I wasn't going to have to

59:20.975 --> 59:24.645
make another payment on that this month.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.940
Look, I don't know
what you want me to do.

59:28.023 --> 59:30.067
I can lie to ya.
Tell you I'm writing a check

59:30.151 --> 59:32.361
and I'm putting it in the mail,
and you'll have it right away.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.489
OK? I'm gonna write you a check right now,

59:35.573 --> 59:37.867
I'm gonna put it in the mail
and you'll have it tomorrow.

59:37.950 --> 59:40.369
How's that sound?
Terrific, outstanding,

59:40.453 --> 59:41.620
look forward to it.

59:44.623 --> 59:47.334
- Which one? American Express?
- Mortgage.

59:49.587 --> 59:51.755
Yvette asked me
if I could work tomorrow night.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.966
- That's New Years Eve.
- Double time.

59:54.049 --> 59:55.509
- Dad?
- Yeah?

59:55.593 --> 59:57.428
Could you drive me over to Kyle's?

59:57.511 --> 01:00:00.055
No, I'm busy now. OK? C'mon.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.395
C'mon, Drew.

01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:09.774
Hey. Why don't you play Guitar Hero?

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:11.525
Halo? You should play some Xbox.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.360
Hey, Bobby. Hang on a sec.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:15.863
Come here. Hey! Drew!

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:20.034
Hey! Drew!

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.829
Damn it. There's a fucking nor'easter outside.

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:26.665
Kid's pissed off because
I won't drive him to Cotuit

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:29.001
to visit the Matlocks.
Right, right when he wants him to.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:32.421
He doesn't have the Xbox anymore.

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:34.048
- Why? What happened to it?
- He gave it back.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:35.174
What?

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.301
He knew we couldn't afford it.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.804
He asked me if he could,
and I said yes.

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:44.725
He's right. We can't afford it.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.682
I need a job, Jack.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.289
I don't think you're gonna
be needing that just yet.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.711
Nice tool belt, man.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:31.165
Keep 'em coming, Bob.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.170
Hey, Bobby.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:40.507
- Yeah.
- Grab two this time.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:11.180
Lunch.

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:13.040
Where are we going?

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:33.811
They're new.
That's why you're getting blisters.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.396
Thanks.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.316
- Here.
- Appreciate it.

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:53.247
Hey. You wanna come down for dinner?

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:56.375
I want you to take a gun and shoot me.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:58.669
Just shoot me.

01:03:58.952 --> 01:04:00.921
Let me see.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:03.590
Yeah, let me get the Neosporin.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:04.675
I hate your brother.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.927
I fucking hate him.

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:10.639
I don't think I can go back.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.810
Sure you can.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:49.553
Too thin. Add another sack to the mix.

01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:59.605
Easy work, Bobby?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:01.440
Pretty much like moving cost reports

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.526
from the in-box to the out-box,
am I right?

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:11.074
Didn't say nothin'.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:14.578
<i>... plans to make
credit easier for small businesses.</i>

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.664
<i>How does he propose to do that
with credit as tight as it is?</i>

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:21.668
<i>The president wants to take 15 billion dollars
for the bank rescue fund.</i>

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:25.339
<i>Basically bankroll small business loans
made for the FDA.</i>

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:29.009
<i>He wants to temporarily
waive the fee for borrowers...</i>

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.636
What do you have planned today?

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.013
Not much.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.141
Ed and Dana invited us to dinner tonight.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:41.438
- Who?
- My old friends.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.360
7:30.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:51.281
Pick up a nice bottle of Pinot
when you go out, OK?

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.038
OK.

01:05:58.122 --> 01:05:59.790
<i>President Obama plans to spend up to</i>

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.793
<i>250 billion dollars taking...</i>

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:06.380
- Hi, Phil Woodward.
- Just sign in and take a seat.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.113
Hell, Jack, you hear that?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:36.159
Bob gets 12 weeks pay
when they fucking shitcanned him.

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:39.580
My uncle Tommy worked for
the phone company 19 years.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:42.082
They laid him off 10 months short
of lifetime medical.

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:47.212
They hire him back,
like four months later.

01:06:47.296 --> 01:06:51.675
Half his old wages, no benefits.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:54.094
- What's this?
- It's your paycheck.

01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.473
Hey, Jack.

01:06:58.557 --> 01:07:00.434
There's an extra 200 in this.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:08.025
Must've made a mistake, Bob.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:19.345
You gonna be all right,
sleeping in the same room as your sister for awhile?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.349
Sure.

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:39.908
- All tucked in?
- Yeah, Dad.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.209
I couldn't wait to get out of this house.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:56.174
My parents, neighborhood, church.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.725
I was gonna be a CEO.

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:16.444
She seems nice, Dad.
Good with kids.

01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:18.863
- She have any of her own?
- Hey.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:21.658
What? Never too late to start.

01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:24.493
Think you and Susan
could get away for a week in June?

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:26.912
We rented a house out on Stonewall Beach.

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:29.416
June? Maybe.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.462
So you keeping busy?

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:36.089
Yeah, I've been asked
to join a couple of boards.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:37.716
Dynex, Procar.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.343
- You gonna do it?
- I don't know.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:44.055
I think I'm... I think
I'm tired of board rooms.

01:09:46.058 --> 01:09:47.559
Why don't you start a consulting firm?

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.185
- Yeah?
- Sure.

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.395
There's always somebody out there willing to

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.232
pay an opinionated old bastard
for some shitty advice.

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:03.658
So, what do you say
to the Vineyard in June?

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:05.202
Your mother will be OK.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:06.953
You two talking?

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.333
She's having a pretty rough time.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:14.252
She's talking about selling the house.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:17.964
Look Daddy, I found another egg!

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.475
Where's Mike?

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.104
- He... got busted again.
- For what?

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:33.814
Drunk and disorderly.

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.232
Assault.

01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:39.778
Managed to take a swing
at one of the cops, too.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:40.987
Thanks.

01:10:43.407 --> 01:10:45.367
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah?

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.661
- Still have your tool belt?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.247
Why don't you grab it.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.166
All right.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.635
- Oh, Jesus.
- I thought I had it measured right.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:07.514
You got to rip all this shit out
before Jack sees it.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.307
- The whole thing?
- Yeah, all of it.

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:13.103
Use your speed square as a spacer.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.355
Get it on two points.
Give me that.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:19.443
All right?
One right there. Bang.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:21.820
Bang.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:24.406
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:37.127
- Finally done?
- This side, yeah.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:44.509
Jesus Christ. That's ugly.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.973
If you... need another guy,

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.392
I know somebody who could use a job.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.880
Yeah? Well, whoever it is,
let's hope he...

01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:59.566
let's hope he isn't
as slow as you are.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:02.903
OK.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:40.815
He ever sing on-key?

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:42.984
No.

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.054
What're you doin'?

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.515
Oh, getting drunk.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.185
I called outplacement,
see if you wanted to have lunch.

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:19.312
They said you hadn't been
coming in much lately.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:23.149
- Oh, yeah.
- Couple of weeks now.

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:25.402
No kidding.

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.490
Miss.

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.328
What do you say,
I give you a ride home?

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.499
Can't go home.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.546
Lorna doesn't want the neighbors to know

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:48.258
I got fired so I can't
show up until after six.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.430
Makes me haul my briefcase
back and forth, too.

01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:57.976
You see the <i>Journal</i> this morning?

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:03.231
They listed how much CEOs made last year.

01:14:04.316 --> 01:14:06.318
You know who was 17th on the list?

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:10.363
James Salinger, GTX.

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:16.620
Wanna go to the movies?

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:20.165
Take you to the matinee,
sure they still have matinees.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:23.460
We can get a bucket of popcorn,
couple of those big Cokes.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:45.690
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, beautiful.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.820
- What are you smiling at?
- A man called today from Chicago.

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:52.155
Fred Munder?

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.658
He said he was impressed with your resume,
wanted you to give him a call.

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:57.285
His phone number's over there.

01:14:59.204 --> 01:15:01.748
That's where he's based.
The guy's a headhunter.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.792
I just thought the job was in Boston.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.628
It is in Boston.
I'm gonna go there,

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:10.382
I'm gonna stay in Motel 6.
OK, I'm gonna eat very inexpensively.

01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:14.094
The job is a vice president
of sales and marketing

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:17.055
with extensive experience in transportation. OK?

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.475
This is it. This is me.
This is my job.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:21.851
I don't know what else I can look for.

01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:25.939
- This is the one.
- OK. OK.

01:16:22.162 --> 01:16:23.496
Excuse me.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.416
I have an appointment with
Frederick Munder. Robert Walker.

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.065
Mr. Walker?

01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:52.442
Yes?

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.861
I'm Jane Nefeld,
Mr. Munder's assistant.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.780
- Hi.
- You say you have an appointment.

01:16:56.863 --> 01:16:57.864
Yes. At 10.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:16:59.657
I don't see it.

01:17:01.741 --> 01:17:04.287
I spoke to Mr. Munder myself.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:08.333
So, Friday at 10.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.043
We talked two days ago.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.796
Oh my, he has you down for next Friday.

01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:15.632
The 17th. Can you come back next week?

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:17.926
I flew in from Boston.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:19.552
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.763
I don't mind just sitting in the waiting room.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.056
Or I could come back this afternoon.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.265
My flight doesn't leave until tonight.

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:26.851
Oh, Mr. Munder's in Dallas on business.

01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:28.895
He won't be back till next Wednesday.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:23.491
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Got caught on a call.

01:18:23.575 --> 01:18:25.285
No problem. I got a drink.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:28.371
Looks good.
I'll have what he's having.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.206
Hang on. You know what you want?

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.125
I'll have the Cobb, no bacon.

01:18:34.993 --> 01:18:38.464
Rib eye, medium rare.
With fries.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:41.968
Sorry to rush things.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.554
I have to get back for
a staff meeting at 1:30.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.723
You look great, you losing weight?

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:51.019
Yeah, well. Dying my hair.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.316
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm fine.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:57.859
Sending out a lot of resumes.

01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.194
You're lucky to be out of it.

01:19:01.578 --> 01:19:03.364
Word on the street is,

01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:05.950
you're looking for a foreign exec.

01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:07.994
You have someone to recommend?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.746
Yeah, me.

01:19:11.706 --> 01:19:13.124
It's international travel.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:17.045
I have extensive overseas experience.

01:19:17.128 --> 01:19:18.504
I'm sure you do.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.091
You mind my asking...
how old are you, Phil?

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:29.015
You're not worried I'll sue?

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:33.895
I wouldn't hire anyone over 30 for that job.
It's a killer.

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.397
Out of the country
five out of every six weeks.

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:42.654
- Well, travel's not a problem.
- Why don't you cash it in?

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:45.323
Shit, I would, go lie on a beach.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:48.951
I can't afford to go lie
on a fucking beach.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:55.541
I can't recommend you for the job, Phil,

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.752
they'd laugh me out of the office.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:26.864
Lorna's pretty worried about you.
Has you wrapped around a tree someplace.

01:20:30.742 --> 01:20:32.328
Sons of bitches!

01:20:39.711 --> 01:20:41.087
Motherfuckers!

01:20:43.423 --> 01:20:48.177
Tom Brady couldn't hit that building
from here on his best day.

01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:52.515
Sarah's tuition for Brown is due.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:55.727
I write the check,
I can't make the mortgage.

01:20:55.810 --> 01:20:59.355
- Phil. I could...
- No, you stop it.

01:21:02.734 --> 01:21:03.818
No.

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:08.489
You know the worst part?

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.868
The world didn't stop.

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:16.372
The newspaper still came every morning.

01:21:16.456 --> 01:21:20.835
The automatic sprinklers
shut off at six and...

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:24.130
Jeff, next door,
still washed his car every Sunday.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.011
My life ended.

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:34.182
And, you know, nobody noticed.

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:47.403
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah.

01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:49.822
- Boss says it's quitting time.
- All right.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.252
- Where's Jack?
- Still working.

01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:06.172
- Come on, I'm buyin'.
- What's he doing?

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.341
He's working late
to make the completion deadline.

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:10.593
- Get the bonus.
- He doesn't want our help?

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:14.847
- He can't pay us.
- Pay us out of the bonus.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.268
He needs the bonus to break even.

01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:22.063
He underbid the job to keep us working
through the winter.

01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:18.197
Could Maggie give Sally a ride home?

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:51.564
We used to make something here.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.649
Back before we got lost in the paperwork.

01:25:53.733 --> 01:25:57.611
At one time, we had a frigate,
right here, back there.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:59.155
Guided missile cruiser.

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:02.992
Phil started out here, in hull assembly.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:05.661
He was a skinny little bastard.

01:26:05.745 --> 01:26:09.165
Fearless. He'd hang upside down all day long

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:11.917
in a bosun's chair,
70 feet off the shop floor

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.421
welding an inside seam.
I mean, Jesus.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:23.387
Two thousand men a shift,
three shifts a day.

01:26:23.471 --> 01:26:29.060
Six thousand men earned
an honest wage in that room.

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:33.230
Fed their kids, bought homes.

01:26:33.314 --> 01:26:35.441
Made enough to send
their kids to college.

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:37.902
Buy a second car.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.281
Building something they could see.

01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:48.287
Not just figures on a balance sheet,
but a ship.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.457
They could see, smell, touch.

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:58.214
Those men knew their worth,
knew who they were.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:05.679
One day you're making fifty dollars

01:27:05.763 --> 01:27:09.141
the next day, 5,000.
And then one day, five million.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.603
Start out with a crazy plan.

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:14.438
Take insane risks.

01:27:14.522 --> 01:27:16.357
Barely make enough money
to feed your family.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.526
Not a chance in hell
you're going to succeed.

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:22.279
And then, all of a sudden,
you've got all these things.

01:27:22.363 --> 01:27:23.823
You get terrified of losing them.

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:26.659
Stock options, corporate jets,

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.953
vacation homes in the Bahamas.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:32.957
You know. Truth is...

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:37.711
I like 500 dollar lunches
and 5000 dollar hotel suites.

01:27:42.967 --> 01:27:44.552
Now everything I spent 30 years

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:47.388
trying to build for myself
and everybody else is...

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.686
gone.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.804
I'm sorry, Maggie.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.223
For what?

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:38.147
For everything. For letting you down.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.858
You haven't let me down.

01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:49.408
Yeah, I did.

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.578
You were never here before.

01:28:56.749 --> 01:28:58.209
And now you are.

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:16.936
I think the dryer vent's clogged.
I'll take a look at it.

01:29:18.646 --> 01:29:20.439
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.486
It can wait.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.288
- This meeting...
- Hello, Jim.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.673
Gene. How ya been?

01:29:45.756 --> 01:29:49.051
Not good. I was recently fired
by my best friend.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:54.682
Missed ya at the funeral.

01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:57.726
I was sorry to hear about Phil.

01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:01.647
How's Lorna holding up?

01:30:05.609 --> 01:30:10.489
We built something here, Jim. Together.

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.992
Together. It wasn't just you,
it wasn't just me.

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.285
It was all of us.

01:30:14.368 --> 01:30:15.995
They got a paycheck every week.

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:20.666
Medical if they got sick.
Disability if they got hurt.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.668
Hell, it's a business, not a charity.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.628
You took home
22 million dollars last year

01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:26.964
and these people have lost
their homes, their marriages,

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:28.424
the respect of their children.

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:31.427
We did what the market
required of us to survive!

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.601
The Board accepted Allied's bid last night.

01:30:39.685 --> 01:30:41.645
Thirty-nine billion, 97 a share.

01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:44.607
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:46.734
My shares are worth 600 million.

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:52.197
- Congratulations.
- What are yours worth, Gene?

01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:59.413
I have to get to work.

01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:47.836
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

01:31:51.507 --> 01:31:54.134
Clear for possession, all right?
You're in trouble now, kid!

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:03.394
Oh, no!

01:32:12.403 --> 01:32:14.571
Hit the head flat on it.
There you go.

01:32:14.655 --> 01:32:18.784
That's it. Try a little more action.
Sink it.

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.744
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

01:32:20.828 --> 01:32:23.205
Gene McClary's on the phone,
something about a job.

01:32:26.215 --> 01:32:28.419
Get some more 18 inch sinkers,
I'll be right back.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.138
What are you waiting for?

01:33:12.463 --> 01:33:14.465
You working Sundays now?

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.052
Talked to Dierdre,
she says you're down here every weekend.

01:33:21.305 --> 01:33:24.308
- Losing money on this job, Jack?
- A bit.

01:33:25.726 --> 01:33:27.227
'Cause of me?

01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:34.860
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.320
It all comes out in the end.

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.367
Got a call from a guy today.
Used to work for him.

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.995
- Offered me a job.
- Yeah? Decent pay?

01:33:46.205 --> 01:33:49.249
- Eighty.
- Thousand?

01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:50.584
Yeah.

01:33:52.503 --> 01:33:54.338
It's half what I used to make.

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:57.674
World's a fucked up place.

01:34:00.636 --> 01:34:02.596
Actually, I was thinking about...

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:05.098
staying on with you, Jack.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.603
My old job,
I was scared all the time.

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:11.897
The quarterly cost reports,

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.609
young guys coming up,
losing an account,

01:34:15.692 --> 01:34:17.027
who was getting ahead of me.

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:18.654
Can I be honest with you, Bobby?

01:34:18.737 --> 01:34:22.241
- Yeah.
- You should take that job.

01:34:23.659 --> 01:34:24.827
You're a shitty carpenter.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.291
Christ.

01:34:32.543 --> 01:34:34.211
Can't make these damn things any lighter?

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:46.181
I... I can't pay you for today.

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:50.469
Guess we better get started then.

01:34:51.979 --> 01:34:53.730
I will win, why?

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.235
Why? Because I have faith,

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.904
courage, enthusiasm.

01:35:00.988 --> 01:35:04.658
I will win! Why?

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:09.204
Because I have faith,
courage, enthusiasm.

01:35:09.288 --> 01:35:12.583
I will win! Why?

01:35:12.666 --> 01:35:16.837
Because I have faith,
courage, enthusiasm.

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:21.174
Could we get a pencil sharpener?

01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:23.677
- Sure.
- The kind with a crank?

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.555
- Oh, the old fashioned kind.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:28.891
McClary Maritime Associates?

01:35:30.309 --> 01:35:31.810
Yeah, we don't have any associates yet,

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.270
but what the hell, it sounds good.

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:34.897
The printer's from the dark ages.

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.524
I'll stop by Staples tomorrow,
get a new one.

01:35:37.608 --> 01:35:38.609
OK.

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:43.947
- Nice office.
- It's not much.

01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:46.533
If I make the overhead the first year,
I'll be happy.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:50.912
Ran into Ben Wilson the other day.

01:35:50.996 --> 01:35:53.081
He said you were going out
to possible investors.

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:55.584
Yeah, I'm gonna make a bid for Gloucester.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:57.920
- The shipyard?
- Yeah.

01:35:58.003 --> 01:35:59.671
Allied doesn't want it.

01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:01.131
I've already got the skilled labor,

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.258
I'll just renegotiate with the unions.

01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:05.552
Start slow, see if it'll grow.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:09.848
I think there's a business there.

01:36:13.352 --> 01:36:14.937
Any time for lunch, Tuesday?

01:36:18.857 --> 01:36:20.067
No.

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:29.034
I sat in rooms and talked about
how to destroy people's lives.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:32.621
I thought I could do more
from the inside.

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:35.290
Save a few jobs here and there.

01:36:35.374 --> 01:36:37.167
If I didn't do it, somebody else would.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:48.387
Keep me in mind for a possible associate.

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.139
I think I may be looking for a job.

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:11.576
<i>It's said that its conduct brings into question</i>

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.537
<i>the whole function of Wall Street.</i>

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:16.915
<i>Federal prosecutors are trying to figure out
whether there was criminal fraud</i>

01:37:16.999 --> 01:37:19.501
<i>in Goldman Sachs mortgage trading business.</i>

01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:25.257
- Say hello to Gene for me.
- How do I look?

01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:28.343
Highly employable.

01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:37.477
Go on, you don't want to be late.

01:37:39.146 --> 01:37:41.606
- Come here.
- I love you.

01:37:43.150 --> 01:37:44.317
I love you.

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.403
All right.
Hope you had your fill

01:38:28.487 --> 01:38:30.781
of sitting around the house all day
watching <i>Price is Right.</i>

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:34.951
Time to get working now.
Don't complain about the luxury accommodations here.

01:38:35.035 --> 01:38:37.913
Gene's basically kickstarting this thing
on his AMEX card.

01:38:37.996 --> 01:38:41.458
If you want to impress a client,
take them to the Upper Crust.

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.835
Buy them a slice. Diane?

01:38:43.919 --> 01:38:45.420
I'm gonna need you
to do some seller financing

01:38:45.504 --> 01:38:47.589
and long term lease backs,
if we want to stay competitive.

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:49.633
So, run financials on our old customers,

01:38:49.716 --> 01:38:51.676
vendors, capital expenditure budgets,
future needs.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.261
- You got it.
- OK.

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:55.722
Conal. We need our union guys back.

01:38:55.806 --> 01:38:57.641
- How many?
- I don't know, a hundred?

01:38:57.724 --> 01:38:59.768
Something like that.
Start with the local, see who's available.

01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:02.979
- I'm betting everyone.
- Mechanics, machinists,

01:39:03.063 --> 01:39:05.315
fabricators, welders, engineers.

01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:06.608
Start with the crew chiefs.

01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:08.777
We work as hard in here
every day as we did

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.488
trying to get a job,
we're gonna be all right.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:14.616
What's the worst thing they could do?
Fire us?
