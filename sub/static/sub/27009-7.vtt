10:36.803 --> 10:37.720
It's all I have.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.479
Frank Murphy, you handsome devil.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.982
You got all the answers, don't you?

11:37.155 --> 11:38.406
[Maureen] Your turn, Daddy.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.782
Come on, give me an eight.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.744
[all] Ooh.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.457
"Pay mouse catcher 200 dollars."

11:47.540 --> 11:48.750
[groans]

11:49.542 --> 11:51.252
I can cover it for you there, Frank.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.337
No, no. I got it.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.755
Dad!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.215
Pipe down. I'm your ride home.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.885
Speaking of rides, I see you still got
that old station wagon out front.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.763
Still making my daughter drive that, huh?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.598
I don't make my wife do anything, Stan.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.807
It's fine, Dad.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.060
Not as nice as the Cadillac
I would have bought her

12:07.143 --> 12:09.229
if she'd graduated from college.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.521
But...

12:10.605 --> 12:14.484
Well, Sue's always had
to do things her way.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.779
And she got a '69 Ford out of it.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.657
You know what Ford stands for,
don't you, kids? [chuckles]

12:20.740 --> 12:24.410
"Fix Or Repair Daily." [laughs]

12:24.494 --> 12:27.247
[both laugh]

12:27.330 --> 12:28.748
Yeah. I don't get it.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.626
Just a little good-natured ribbing, Frank.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.586
Didn't you ever play organized sports?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.340
All right, who wants a steak?

12:37.882 --> 12:40.051
Big thick Appalachian steaks!

12:40.593 --> 12:43.513
Frank, you have a baby on the way.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.558
Do you think you should be
wasting your money on T-bones?

12:47.642 --> 12:48.559
[chuckles]

12:48.643 --> 12:51.354
These bloody babies
are way better than T-bones.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.023
U-bones! From the best part of the cow.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.483
Right by the bladder.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.736
Frank, the rain
is still coming down pretty hard.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.114
Rain makes the fire nice and smoky!

13:02.031 --> 13:02.907
[Frank] Ah, shit.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.117
[wind howling]

13:04.200 --> 13:07.078
We're alone now. You can tell us.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.080
How's your marriage? Really?

13:09.163 --> 13:11.124
Angel, I play golf with the bishop.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.960
For a thousand dollars,
he can make it all go away.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.211
[grunting]

13:15.295 --> 13:16.629
Oh, God.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.630
[Frank] Shit!

13:17.714 --> 13:19.424
What's wrong with him?

13:19.507 --> 13:20.883
It's not his fault.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.385
Our whole family's cursed.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.886
I'm going to summer school.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.054
I got no band anymore.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
Nobody knows I'm alive.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.642
-It's like I'm not even he--
-I lost my girlfriend.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.893
You had a girlfriend?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.478
Bridget Fitzsimmons.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.605
Oh, that fucking psycho?

13:34.689 --> 13:36.149
Yeah.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.860
You really think we're cursed?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.403
[grunting]

13:45.199 --> 13:46.701
Never mind.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.703
What's that, Billy?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.788
You say you like your new dad better?

13:51.331 --> 13:55.168
Well, if you're a good boy today,
I'll take you out in the woods with me.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.544
[Evelyn] Goomer?

13:57.211 --> 13:59.172
Uh... Hey, Ev.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.009
Having second thoughts about our marriage?

14:05.011 --> 14:09.474
Goomer, I knew when I married you
that you were different.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.518
But you've changed.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.896
How so?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.564
You don't touch me.

14:16.981 --> 14:21.027
And now I find you over here
waltzing with an empty wedding dress

14:21.110 --> 14:23.196
and wearing Frank's clothes?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.823
What's going on with you?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.367
[sighs]

14:27.450 --> 14:30.870
Okay. I owe you an explanation.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.829
Sit down.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.832
Honey, the truth is...

14:37.502 --> 14:38.961
these are my clothes.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.840
Frank's been stealing them from me
for years. And I miss them.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.843
Why would Frank steal your clothes?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.887
He's a sick man, Ev.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.723
And he said he'd hurt you
if I told anyone.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.893
So my silence,
and sleeping in the basement,

14:54.227 --> 14:58.398
is an expression of how serious
I took our vows on our wedding day,

14:58.856 --> 15:00.817
and also the only thing keeping you safe.

15:05.780 --> 15:10.410
I just knew there had to be some
logical explanation for your behavior.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.954
Oh, it feels so good to get
the truth out in the open.

15:13.037 --> 15:17.208
So does that mean
that we can be romantic again?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.001
Uh...

15:20.169 --> 15:21.129
Yeah.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.922
Oh, Goomie.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.133
[Evelyn] Mwah, mwah.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.428
Oh, my Goomie.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.470
[whimpering]

15:29.554 --> 15:32.140
[Evelyn] Frank's not gonna
hurt you anymore.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.267
[wind howling and rain pattering]

15:34.350 --> 15:35.560
This is a great steak.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.229
You would pay nine dollars for this
in a restaurant.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.023
I'd pay 50 to have somebody
chew it for me.

15:41.107 --> 15:46.070
It's a proud moment when a man can put
fine steak on the table for his family.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.158
Congratulations, Frank.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.201
Not everyone can afford a meal like this

15:52.285 --> 15:54.620
with what your president's
done to the economy.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.164
He's your president too, Stan.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.291
Oh, I had that Tricky Dick pegged

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
going all the way back
to that debate with Kennedy.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.713
Shifty, unshaven,
sweating like a whore in church.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.549
Oh, Kennedy's father stole
that election from him.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.843
It should've been Nixon
in that limo in Dallas.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.013
They'd be naming airports after him.
The guy can't catch a break!

16:12.096 --> 16:14.265
How could you vote for Nixon,
anyway, Frank?

16:14.348 --> 16:15.808
You're a union man.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.977
On the rare occasion you do have a job.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.398
In 15 years, I was only out of work
for three weeks, Stan.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.025
Oh, my mistake.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.776
It's just that I was sending Sue

16:25.860 --> 16:28.529
a hundred dollars a month
until the end of April.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.156
Daddy! I told you not to--

16:30.239 --> 16:32.116
What? You took money from him?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.827
There's plenty left
on the Pop-Pop tree, Frank.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.497
-You son of a bitch!
-Frank.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.582
I have fucking had it with you!

16:39.665 --> 16:40.958
Buying my kids' love!

16:41.042 --> 16:43.794
Hey, I've never paid for it
once in my life!

16:43.878 --> 16:45.588
They love me for me! Right?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.591
Right?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.010
-Say it!
-[all] Yes.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.595
That sounded convincing.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.348
Oh, you're father of the year,
aren't you, Stan?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.933
At least with your daughter you are.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.100
Frank.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.685
Hey, how's Louis doing?

16:59.769 --> 17:03.481
Oh, that's right,
you haven't talked to him in years.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.440
But I know!

17:04.524 --> 17:08.861
He's living a fabulous life in Miami
with his roommate Jeremy!

17:08.945 --> 17:10.905
My son is a confirmed bachelor!

17:10.988 --> 17:14.534
Yeah, confirmed by that undercover cop
in that bus station bathroom!

17:14.617 --> 17:16.494
You told him about that?

17:16.577 --> 17:18.955
He's my husband.
I thought I could trust him.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.457
Grandpa, I think Uncle Louis
wears cool shirts.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.418
Well, maybe we should go.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.380
Yes. I know when we're not wanted.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.299
Ha! If you knew that,
you would have left five hours ago!

17:31.133 --> 17:33.970
Hey, hey, Stan!
You know what Cadillac stands for?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.472
Can't... afford... dick...

17:36.556 --> 17:39.892
in... Lafayette, Louisiana...

17:41.769 --> 17:42.645
Ass-Cunt!

17:43.312 --> 17:45.940
Great. There go the nice people.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.316
I told you, we're cursed.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Oh, for God sake, what's your problem?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.654
I saw the place where I almost died!

17:51.737 --> 17:52.822
Almost!

17:52.905 --> 17:54.949
You're gonna convict me
on an almost?

17:55.032 --> 17:58.077
Christ, if you stayed in the stroller
like I told you, you would've been fine.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.204
I was strapped into the stroller
when it rolled in!

18:00.288 --> 18:02.707
Then take it up
with Baby-B-Safe Industries!

18:02.790 --> 18:04.750
They designed that fucking thing, not me!

18:05.167 --> 18:08.004
Look, you can sit around and dwell
on what happened 13 years ago

18:08.087 --> 18:09.088
for the rest of your life,

18:09.171 --> 18:11.007
or you can be a man
and do something about it!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.759
I am doing something about it now!
I'm leaving!

18:15.011 --> 18:16.220
[Kevin] Dick!

18:16.596 --> 18:17.680
[groans]

18:17.763 --> 18:18.806
And what's with you?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.933
You've been whining and moaning
since we got here.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.435
This is a vacation, not a funeral!

18:22.518 --> 18:25.146
A funeral for my heart!

18:25.980 --> 18:26.856
[Bill] Dick!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.691
Oh, great. All the kids are gone.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.443
I'm right here.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.112
Oh, sorry, Princess, I didn't notice you.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.989
Nobody does!

18:35.865 --> 18:36.907
[Maureen] Dick.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.286
Don't stray too far from the murder cabin.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.833
Congratulations, Frank,
you ran everyone off.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.460
You ruined the vacation.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.211
Oh, so I made it rain.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.340
I told those geese
to fuck on the kitchen table.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.925
I hacked up
the Van de Camp family in 1926.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.303
All I'm saying is, this whole summer

18:57.386 --> 19:00.056
you've had a shitty attitude
to every single person around you,

19:00.139 --> 19:03.017
except for Chet, the chosen one,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.227
who craps golden turds
and treats his wife like dirt.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.356
Oh, his wife,
who you think is so helpless.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.982
Hey, Susan, news flash,

19:10.066 --> 19:12.610
she survived
a fucking war zone without you.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.488
Nguyen-Nguyen is just your latest project
to fill up your life

19:15.571 --> 19:17.531
since your Forkoontula went tits up!

19:18.115 --> 19:21.577
You take that back.
That was important to me, you son of a--

19:21.661 --> 19:23.704
[groans]

19:23.788 --> 19:24.830
Oh, oh, God.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.624
What is it? Are you in labor?

19:26.707 --> 19:27.917
Is the baby coming?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.710
Frank. Oh! [grunts]

19:29.794 --> 19:31.420
Oh, Christ. It's coming now!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.340
Get on the table and take off your pants!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.425
-Frank, I'm--
-It's okay, you're panicking.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.551
I got this!

19:39.428 --> 19:41.514
What the fuck are you doing?

19:42.098 --> 19:44.767
What does it look like?
I'm bringing a baby into this world.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.770
[laughs]

19:47.853 --> 19:51.107
You idiot. I'm not having the baby.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.608
Heh-heh, you're not?

19:52.692 --> 19:57.613
No! I got indigestion from that truck tire
you called a steak.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.365
I think there was a beak in there.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.618
[chuckles] Well, that's what I get
for buying beef at an ostrich farm.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.955
You were gonna deliver a baby
with barbecue tongs?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.498
It's safer than the Forkoontula.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.208
[laughs]

20:09.291 --> 20:10.793
That thing sucked.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.378
It did!

20:12.461 --> 20:14.839
[both laugh]

20:18.592 --> 20:22.263
Ooh, come on! You're a ring and a bottle.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.889
Why do you hate each other?

20:23.973 --> 20:26.726
Ah, kid, you'll get them next time.
It's easy, see?

20:27.268 --> 20:29.019
[clinking]

20:33.023 --> 20:35.192
Step right up, everybody's a winner!

20:35.276 --> 20:36.944
-[Maureen groans]
-Except her.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.077
I'm not gonna let you
ruin my life anymore.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.205
Tonight, I un-drown.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.917
Water, get ready
to fill your lungs with Kevin.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.005
I can't do it!

20:57.506 --> 20:58.883
[gurgling]

20:58.966 --> 21:01.302
No! Shit!

21:01.469 --> 21:04.221
Shit! I take it back! I take it back!

21:04.513 --> 21:06.015
I was only kidding, water!

21:12.938 --> 21:14.106
[sobs]

21:14.190 --> 21:15.065
Bridget.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.901
Bridget.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.445
Huh?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.667
Farewell, Bridget.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.756
Ah!

21:38.839 --> 21:40.257
[Sue laughs]

21:41.467 --> 21:44.512
And then she said
the Forkoontula was worse

21:44.595 --> 21:46.889
than her grandfather bleeding to death!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.516
Well, there's your ad campaign!

21:48.599 --> 21:51.477
[both laugh]

21:52.061 --> 21:54.063
-Oh, Christ.
-Oh.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.439
[sighs]

21:55.523 --> 21:56.357
Ah.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.650
We're screwed, aren't we?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.193
Yeah, yeah, we are.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.071
Remember that night after the parade
when we both said

22:02.154 --> 22:03.906
we weren't worried about the baby coming?

22:03.989 --> 22:04.865
Yeah.

22:04.949 --> 22:07.284
Well, that was a lot of bullshit,
wasn't it?

22:07.368 --> 22:08.244
Yeah.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.914
I tried to finish the wallpaper
and spent the whole night crying.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.835
Oh, I know... I watched from the stairs
and went back to bed.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.838
-[chuckles] You're an asshole.
-I know.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.215
[sighs]

22:21.298 --> 22:23.592
I think throwing myself
into the Forkoontula

22:23.676 --> 22:25.302
and getting all involved
with Nguyen-Nguyen

22:25.386 --> 22:27.930
was a way of avoiding
all my fears about the baby.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.473
I'm guilty too, with Chet.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.725
Hey, but at least he's making
that room for us.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.769
You really think he's working on the room?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.980
I do! I'm stupid, remember?

22:36.063 --> 22:38.983
[both laugh]

22:39.066 --> 22:41.819
Oh, Sue, it's so good
to laugh with you again.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.529
We're gonna be okay, right?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.073
Sure. We're good parents.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.327
We've got three healthy kids
who are doing just fine for themselves.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.663
[babbling and shouting]

22:54.248 --> 22:55.499
[panting] Ah!

22:59.628 --> 23:00.880
[screams]

23:00.963 --> 23:02.339
[Maureen] God damn it!

23:02.923 --> 23:04.592
I hate this game!

23:05.676 --> 23:07.553
Hey, take it easy, this is my house.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.763
-[crying]
-Okay, that's it.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.265
We're closed. Run along.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.976
Oh, sure. What do you care?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.686
Nobody wants me around.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.187
And once this new baby comes,

23:17.271 --> 23:19.023
I'm gonna be a middle kid.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.941
I might as well be dead.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.651
Or Bill!

23:22.735 --> 23:25.654
Kid, a stuffed bear
ain't gonna solve that.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.782
Especially these ones, they're full
of lice and Chinese newspapers.

23:29.366 --> 23:33.579
I don't want a stupid bear.
I just want to be noticed!

23:33.662 --> 23:35.539
It's not fair!

23:37.958 --> 23:40.252
You're right. It's not fair.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.838
This game is rigged against you.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.381
Life is rigged.

23:44.465 --> 23:48.218
You think I wanted to be stuck here in
this game booth all my life? Hell, no!

23:48.802 --> 23:51.221
I wanted to be over there
running the Tilt-A-Whirl.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.350
You get to sit on a stool like a god.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.852
But no, that's Delbert's turf.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.897
His old man handed it down to him.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.357
That's how the world works.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.485
The Jews run the banks
and the Delberts run the Tilt-A-Whirl.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.530
It's too late for me. I just turned 17.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.698
Huh?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.117
But you got your whole life ahead of you.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.954
You can do anything
you set your sights on.

24:15.037 --> 24:18.958
All I want is to win a ring toss
on a TV clown show.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.542
Then you're in luck.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.545
I'm gonna show you how to beat
this here rigged game.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.672
Here's the scam.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.966
[grunting]

24:40.145 --> 24:41.063
[coughs]

24:41.146 --> 24:42.189
[panting]

24:44.149 --> 24:45.192
You okay?

24:45.734 --> 24:48.404
You saved me, Dad. And guess what?

24:48.946 --> 24:51.323
I did it. I faced my fear.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.574
Good for you.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.787
Now get out of my pool,
you fucking draft dodger.

24:56.870 --> 24:57.830
Thanks, Dad.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
That's the nicest thing you've ever
said to me.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.221
[clinking]

25:14.304 --> 25:16.223
Ah!

25:16.306 --> 25:17.349
Oh, no!

25:18.350 --> 25:19.893
Ah!

25:28.944 --> 25:29.987
Hey, boy!

25:30.738 --> 25:32.614
Thanks for looking after him, Goom.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.074
My pleasure, Frank.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.617
Enjoy your pants.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.494
I will.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.746
Dad.

25:38.829 --> 25:41.790
Oh, Kevin, don't start.
We just had a nice drive home.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.668
I want to tell you I had
a life-changing experience last night.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.504
It was like I was baptized...

25:48.005 --> 25:49.006
but with water.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.258
And it made me realize something.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.927
I'm through wasting my life.

25:54.011 --> 25:56.889
I found peace and I'm gonna be a new man.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.809
I love you, and I don't blame you anymore.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.312
What? I'm not buying you a guitar,

26:03.395 --> 26:05.272
and you still have to go
to summer school tomorrow.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.316
-Get off me.
-[Sue] Frank! Come here!

26:07.399 --> 26:08.901
Oh, Christ. Sue!

26:08.984 --> 26:09.943
Sue, what the hell is--

26:11.320 --> 26:13.197
Want to see your baby's room?

26:15.574 --> 26:18.410
He did it. Chet really did it.

26:18.869 --> 26:22.372
Holy shit, he finished it. What a friend.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.959
All right, God. [chuckles]

26:26.043 --> 26:27.377
You got me back for a little while.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.715
Bill, go to church on Sunday
and tell me what happens!

26:31.799 --> 26:33.342
[Bill] Well, what did I do?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.436
No need to thank me.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.065
I'm just a concerned citizen
looking out for his community.

26:48.899 --> 26:49.817
My name?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.194
