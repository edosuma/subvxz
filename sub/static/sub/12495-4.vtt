Hey, guys.

You got to check this out.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.101
Quiet!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.101
We're playing a game.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.020
No problem.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.020
I'll take over your screen.

00:20.312 --> 00:23.273
Hey, hey, hey!

00:20.312 --> 00:23.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:24.358 --> 00:25.943
Just watch the video.

00:25.985 --> 00:26.986
What video?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.445
It's from the news

00:27.027 --> 00:28.445
last night.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.071
It's called

00:28.487 --> 00:30.071
"Captain Man's big fail."

00:30.113 --> 00:31.490
Ooh, play it.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.702
Hey, look.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.702
My belly button.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.622
Play the video.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.124
<i>We're live</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:41.124

00:41.166 --> 00:43.794

00:41.166 --> 00:43.794

00:43.836 --> 00:45.004
<i>This time the Phone Shark</i>

00:45.044 --> 00:47.631
<i>bit through</i>

00:45.044 --> 00:47.631
<i>a dozen people's cell phones,</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:55.723
<i>Captain Man, isn't it true</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:55.723
<i>that the Phone Shark</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:58.934
<i>has been attacking</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:58.934
<i>people's phones</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:58.934
<i>for over a year now?</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.228
<i>Yes, that is true.</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:04.857
<i>So, why don't you catch him?</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:07.735
<i>Well, Kid Danger and I</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:07.735
<i>have been trying.</i>

01:08.861 --> 01:10.320
(reporter)

01:08.861 --> 01:10.320
<i>But you keep failing.</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:11.572
<i>Doesn't that bug you?</i>

01:11.613 --> 01:13.240
<i>Yes.</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:15.701
Aw.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.452
I feel bad

01:16.035 --> 01:17.452
for Captain Man.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.038
It's not Captain Man's fault.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.622
He just needs

01:19.079 --> 01:20.622
a better sidekick.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.209
One more time?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.420
Just saying,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.420
I'd be way better

01:26.461 --> 01:28.797
at catching bad guys

01:26.461 --> 01:28.797
than Kid Danger.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.675
(scoffs) You couldn't

01:28.839 --> 01:31.675
catch butt warts.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.720
Oh, yes he could.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.720
Remember fifth grade?

01:34.762 --> 01:37.222
That was a rash.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.222
Big difference.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.060
Whatever.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.060
I think Kid Danger

01:38.515 --> 01:41.060
does a great job.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.063
Why are you

01:42.686 --> 01:44.063
getting all mad?

01:44.103 --> 01:47.190
Because Jasper's

01:44.103 --> 01:47.190
being unfair.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.861
And I think it's unfair

01:47.232 --> 01:50.861
to criticize

01:50.903 --> 01:53.405
that--

01:50.903 --> 01:53.405
that Kid Danger guy,

01:54.031 --> 01:56.617
when he's probably

01:54.031 --> 01:56.617
doing the best he can.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.953
And people

01:56.658 --> 01:58.953
should be fair, you know?

01:58.994 --> 02:00.746
Fairness. I'm pro fair.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.540
Jasper.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.375
What?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.375
Get up.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.543
Why should I?

02:06.585 --> 02:07.795
'Cause you're going

02:06.585 --> 02:07.795

02:07.836 --> 02:09.504

02:09.546 --> 02:12.967

02:13.008 --> 02:16.261
Fine.

02:13.008 --> 02:16.261
Then I'll just

02:16.303 --> 02:18.013

07:40.210 --> 07:41.502
what I'm about to tell you.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.588
What, that

07:41.544 --> 07:43.588

Just promise me

08:01.481 --> 08:03.650
you'll never tell anyone.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.859
I promise.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.945
No, you don't understand.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.364

08:06.987 --> 08:09.364

No. Uh...

Yeah, well,

08:56.370 --> 08:58.288
she's, like, really smart.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.209
And, uh, she...

09:03.335 --> 09:04.878

09:04.919 --> 09:06.087

09:15.013 --> 09:16.348
Yeah.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.724
What did you tell her?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.642
That I am...

09:20.810 --> 09:21.602
Kid Danger.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.771
Oh.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.940
Interesting.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.235
You're not mad, right?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.611
Mad? No.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.155
Cool.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.614
You're fired.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.993
Fired?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.993
That's right.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.828
You can leave your watch

09:37.035 --> 09:38.828

09:38.870 --> 09:40.539
But I swear

09:38.870 --> 09:40.539
I didn't want to tell her.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.748
She figured it out.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.999
Henry...

09:43.041 --> 09:43.833
You took an oath.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.835
I know, but...

09:47.045 --> 09:48.171
You promised me

09:47.045 --> 09:48.171
you wouldn't tell anyone.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.049
And I trusted you

09:48.213 --> 09:51.049
to keep that promise.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.761
When trust is broken,

09:51.841 --> 09:54.761
it can never be fixed.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.636
Yes it can.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.848
Open this cookie

10:42.725 --> 10:44.852

10:42.725 --> 10:44.852

10:44.894 --> 10:46.229
Doesn't matter.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.898
I broke my oath.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.484
Well, you got to fix this.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.734
How?

10:51.776 --> 10:53.236
I don't know.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.488

Jasper was right.

11:09.919 --> 11:10.670
About what?

11:11.421 --> 11:13.714
I was a lame Kid Danger.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.300

16:31.616 --> 16:34.118
you want to bite it.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.580
Come on, yeah.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.580
(sniffs) Mmm!

16:37.622 --> 16:40.249
Gotta love that

16:37.622 --> 16:40.249
new phone smell.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.543
Yeah.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.170
Come on.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.172
Come on!

16:44.211 --> 16:46.172
Give it to me!

16:46.213 --> 16:47.590
Catch it!

16:48.466 --> 16:49.843
(grunting)

16:49.884 --> 16:51.427
(Phone Shark)

16:49.884 --> 16:51.427
Give me the phone!

16:51.469 --> 16:52.887
(man)

16:51.469 --> 16:52.887
He's the Phone Shark!

16:52.929 --> 16:54.138
(man 2) Get him!

16:55.765 --> 16:57.016
(screams)

16:57.892 --> 16:58.852
He's insane!

17:00.186 --> 17:02.981
(grunting)

17:00.186 --> 17:02.981
(man) Oh, my God!

17:03.063 --> 17:04.398
(woman)

17:03.063 --> 17:04.398
Someone call the cops!

17:06.400 --> 17:08.444

Hey! Hey!

17:10.655 --> 17:11.739
Come on!

17:11.781 --> 17:13.032
Come on, Phone Shark!

17:13.324 --> 17:15.201
Come on, come and get it!

17:13.324 --> 17:15.201

17:17.453 --> 17:20.080
(man) Phone Shark down!

17:17.453 --> 17:20.080
Go Kid Danger!

17:20.122 --> 17:22.124
(cheers and applause)

17:24.210 --> 17:27.213
♪♪

17:29.256 --> 17:31.217
Kid Danger, how were you

17:29.256 --> 17:31.217
able to locate

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
and finally apprehend

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
the Phone Shark?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.137
Well, I'd love

17:33.302 --> 17:35.137
to take all the credit,

17:35.179 --> 17:37.849
but it was really

17:35.179 --> 17:37.849
my boss, Captain Man,

17:37.891 --> 17:38.933
who made it all happen.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.435
Interesting.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.435
Can you tell us more?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.687
No.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.941
You gave me all the credit.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.776
Well, everyone's been

17:46.983 --> 17:48.776
giving you a hard time

17:48.818 --> 17:50.319
about not catching

17:48.818 --> 17:50.319
the Phone Shark.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.864
I figured

17:51.738 --> 17:52.864
I'd help you out.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.992
Uh, excuse me.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.494
I'm the one who found

17:56.576 --> 17:58.494
the Phone Shark.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.413
It's true, she did.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.706
Ugh!

18:01.748 --> 18:04.417
Charlotte, Charlotte.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.878
What am I

18:04.458 --> 18:06.878
going to do with you?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.422
Um, I think

18:06.920 --> 18:09.422
it's pretty obvious.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.673
What's that?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.132
Give me a job here.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.095
You guys need me.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.640
First I want to know

18:16.596 --> 18:19.640
how you found the Phone Shark.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.685
Well, I figured

18:19.682 --> 18:22.685
no guy with normal teeth

18:22.727 --> 18:24.353
can bite through a phone,

18:22.727 --> 18:24.353
right?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.731
Okay.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.983
So I started calling

18:27.065 --> 18:28.983
every dentist in Swellview

18:29.025 --> 18:31.235
until I found one

18:29.025 --> 18:31.235
who told me he had a patient

18:31.277 --> 18:34.572
who asked for a whole mouthful

18:31.277 --> 18:34.572
of titanium teeth.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.032
We should've called

18:34.614 --> 18:36.032
some dentists.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.658
Totally should've.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.160
Then I hacked

18:37.992 --> 18:40.160
into the dentist's

18:37.992 --> 18:40.160
computer files,

18:40.202 --> 18:42.246
got the guy's name,

18:40.202 --> 18:42.246
and searched him online.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.290
Oh, we should've

18:42.288 --> 18:44.290
gone online.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.292
What is wrong with us?

18:46.333 --> 18:49.253
Oh, and his last update said,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.881
"Off to my brother's wedding

18:49.295 --> 18:51.881
in Swellview Park.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.550
Hope they serve phones

18:51.923 --> 18:54.550
for dessert. LOL."

18:55.969 --> 18:57.470
And then she called me.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.765
She's good.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.765
She is.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.393
She could really

19:01.724 --> 19:04.393
help us out around here.

19:05.728 --> 19:06.771
Us?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.607
Oh, right.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.442
You fired me.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.695
Well, you broke the oath.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.739
And I caught

19:14.737 --> 19:16.739
the Phone Shark.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.786
Come on, Ray,

19:18.491 --> 19:21.786
hire me back.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.414
All right, you're re-hired.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.791
Yes!

19:29.168 --> 19:30.920
(clears throat)

19:29.168 --> 19:30.920
Cough, cough, cough.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.925
Oh, right.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.925
And what are you going

19:32.463 --> 19:35.925
to do about Charlotte?

19:35.967 --> 19:37.802
(groans)

19:39.178 --> 19:42.098
Well, she knows

19:39.178 --> 19:42.098
you're Kid Danger,

19:43.557 --> 19:45.434
she knows who I am,

19:45.476 --> 19:46.894
and she knows

19:45.476 --> 19:46.894
where the man cave is

19:46.936 --> 19:48.896
because you brought her

19:46.936 --> 19:48.896
down here.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.273
So, what does that mean?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.817
That we either

19:51.315 --> 19:52.817
have to kill you,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.194
erase your brain,

19:52.859 --> 19:55.194
or give you a job.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.403
I vote job.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.655
We can really

19:56.445 --> 19:57.655
erase her brain?

19:57.697 --> 19:58.823
Dude.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.450
All right,

19:59.866 --> 20:01.450
she can have a job here.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.994
Awesome.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.994
If...

20:03.577 --> 20:06.497
She can pass

20:03.577 --> 20:06.497
the pickle test.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.460
(grunting)

20:13.587 --> 20:14.755
Thanks, Bork.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.298
Now, grunt and exit.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.925
(grunting)

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
Charlotte...

20:21.804 --> 20:23.764
you must now prove

20:21.804 --> 20:23.764
you're clever enough

20:23.806 --> 20:25.933
to work for Captain Man.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.351
Uh, I found

20:25.975 --> 20:27.351
the Phone Shark.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.936
Well,

20:27.393 --> 20:28.936
anyone could do that.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.521
Not you two.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.521
Hey, you know what?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.398
Okay, let's not

20:30.563 --> 20:32.398
go there again.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.607
Now...

20:33.649 --> 20:35.026
To prove your worthiness,

20:35.068 --> 20:37.987
you must get that pickle

20:35.068 --> 20:37.987
out of that jar

20:38.029 --> 20:39.780
that Bork

20:38.029 --> 20:39.780
just power-screwed shut.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.281
How much time

20:39.822 --> 20:41.281
does she have?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.534
Exactly five min--

20:47.413 --> 20:48.831
here's your pickle.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.669
That was Bork's

20:51.751 --> 20:53.669
favorite jar.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.882
Wait, is Charlotte hired?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.926
Yeah, yeah, she's hired.

Wait, you want to see

something cool?

21:05.056 --> 21:07.307
Yeah.

Hug me.

to squeeze my foot.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.396
No.
