SOMETIMES YOU PLAN
SOMETHING SPECIAL

06:50.644 --> 06:53.078
AND THINGS JUST
DON'T WORK OUT?

06:53.080 --> 06:56.815

08:16.363 --> 08:17.696
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.098
AT FIRST A HANDSHAKE
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH

08:20.100 --> 08:22.100
BUT... REALLY IT'S
THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

08:22.102 --> 08:27.038
HEY, SPONGEBOB,
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THIS BOX OF CHOCOLATES.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.873

10:04.738 --> 10:05.904
YOU BROKE MY HEART!

10:05.906 --> 10:09.307
NOW I'M GOING TO BREAK

10:09.309 --> 10:14.279
OKAY, PATRICK, I KNOW
I DESERVE THIS, BUT DO THEY?

10:14.281 --> 10:17.549
THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME
ANYTHING, EITHER.

10:17.551 --> 10:21.353
NOPE, IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT NOW...

10:21.355 --> 10:24.823

20:41.341 --> 20:42.974
SQUIDWARD?

20:42.976 --> 20:44.542
TRADE...

20:45.578 --> 20:46.577
HEY, LISTEN.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.547
EVERYTHING MUST... GO!

20:49.549 --> 20:51.115
WELL, THAT'S THE LAST OF IT.

20:51.117 --> 20:55.686
I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING
BUT THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK.

20:57.357 --> 21:01.225
OH... SQUIDWARD, IS THIS
STILL PART OF THE TEST?

21:01.227 --> 21:03.928
BECAUSE IT'S...
IT'S REALLY GETTING

21:03.930 --> 21:07.265
HARDER AND HARDER
TO KEEP MY PROMISE.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.133
OKAY, THE SHIRT!

21:09.969 --> 21:12.270
TAKE IT, TAKE MY SHIRT!

21:12.272 --> 21:13.904
SQUIDWARD'S SHIRT.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.141
I... I'VE ALWAYS
LOVED THAT SHIRT.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.077
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL TRADE!

21:20.079 --> 21:21.779
I CAN BREAK A PROMISE
FOR THIS.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.482
SQUIDWARD, DO YOU WANT
YOUR OTHER STUFF?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.850
'CAUSE THIS IS
ALL I'LL NEED.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.653
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THAT JUNK,
BECAUSE NOW I'VE GOT THIS.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.223
I'VE GOT THE PAPER, AND
YOU'VE GOT MY USELESS GARBAGE.

21:32.225 --> 21:33.991
I GOT IT! HA, HA, HA.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.126
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.161
I GOT IT,
YOU'RE A SUCKER.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.195
YOU'RE A SUCKER.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.130
(<i> laughs</i> ) AT LAST.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.999
WHAT SHOULD WE TRY FIRST,
MR. PAPER? IMPRESSIONS!

21:42.001 --> 21:44.035
A GUY WITH A PIECE OF PAPER
ON HIS NOSE.

21:44.037 --> 21:47.271
LOOK AT ME, I'M A GUY WITH
A PIECE OF PAPER...

21:47.273 --> 21:50.975
ON HIS... NOSE.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.110
HMM... AHA!

21:53.112 --> 21:54.879
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.682
TA-DA!

21:57.684 --> 22:00.951
Children:
BOO!

22:02.255 --> 22:04.422
OKAY, OKAY, UH... HELICOPTER!

22:04.424 --> 22:08.192
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.361
I'M FLYING!

22:10.363 --> 22:13.297
OH, YEAH, I'M FLYING!

22:13.299 --> 22:14.198
I'M FLYING!

22:14.200 --> 22:16.300
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT,
HERE WE GO NOW.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.537
I'M FLYING, FLYING, FLYING,
FLYING, FLYING, FLYING...

22:19.539 --> 22:20.938
(<i> wheezing</i> ):
FLYING...

22:20.940 --> 22:24.208
(<i> clarinet squeaking...</i> )

22:33.686 --> 22:36.754
WAIT, MORE IMPRESSIONS.

22:36.756 --> 22:41.158
A GUY THROWING A PIECE OF PAPER
ON THE GROUND!

22:41.160 --> 22:45.296
A GUY STOMPING
ON THE PIECE OF PAPER!

22:45.298 --> 22:49.333
I'M A GUY WHO TRADED
EVERYTHING HE OWNS FOR...

22:49.335 --> 22:52.203
A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF PAPER.

22:52.205 --> 22:55.606
HEY, THANKS, IT'S JUST
WHAT I NEEDED, SQUIDWARD.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.274
(<i> chewing</i> )

23:03.850 --> 23:06.650
NICE SHIRT, SPONGEBOB.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

23:06.652 --> 23:08.953
(<i> wind blowing</i> )

23:08.955 --> 23:11.389
ANYBODY HAVE ANY SUNSCREEN?
