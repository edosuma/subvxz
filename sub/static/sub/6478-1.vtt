00:45.531 --> 00:46.531
Hello.

00:47.864 --> 00:49.864
I am Andy.

00:50.948 --> 00:54.698
And I would like to thank you
for coming to my movie.

00:56.406 --> 00:59.989
I wish it was better, you know.

01:00.531 --> 01:04.656
But it is so stupid. It's terrible.

01:05.072 --> 01:06.906
I do not even like it.

01:08.239 --> 01:10.948
All of the most important things
in my life...

01:11.031 --> 01:13.823
...are changed around and mixed up...

01:16.906 --> 01:19.656
...for dramatic purposes.

01:21.739 --> 01:22.698
So...

01:24.198 --> 01:28.198
...I decided to cut out all of the baloney.

01:30.989 --> 01:34.739
Now, the movie is much shorter.

01:38.948 --> 01:43.364
In fact, this is the end of the movie.

01:46.031 --> 01:47.823
Thank you very much.

01:57.739 --> 02:00.323
I am not fooling. Good-bye.

02:02.573 --> 02:03.406
Go.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.781
Well, you're still here. Okay!

04:06.656 --> 04:08.031
I hope you're not upset.

04:08.156 --> 04:12.031
I did that to get rid of those folks
who just wouldn't understand me.

04:12.156 --> 04:14.281
And don't even want to try!

04:14.656 --> 04:17.697
Actually, the movie is really great.

04:17.988 --> 04:22.031
It's just filled with colorful characters,
like the one I just did...

04:22.531 --> 04:24.614
...and the one I'm doing now.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.573
Our story begins...

04:30.573 --> 04:33.114
...back in Great Neck, Long Island.

04:37.406 --> 04:39.114
<i>This is our house.</i>

04:39.614 --> 04:41.948
<i>And that's my father's old car.</i>

04:42.281 --> 04:43.948
<i>That's my father.</i>

04:44.323 --> 04:46.198
<i>That's my little brother, Michael.</i>

04:46.323 --> 04:48.573
<i>That's my little sister, Carol.</i>

04:48.698 --> 04:49.781
<i>And that's my mom.</i>

04:49.906 --> 04:53.281
Janice, Andy's up in his room?

04:54.656 --> 04:55.489
Yeah.

05:01.614 --> 05:04.698
Mr. Bear is saying that Mrs. Cat
made his head fall off.

05:04.823 --> 05:08.573
Mrs. Bear is saying, she saw it,
and it's not true.

05:09.114 --> 05:12.781
Today's special guest, Mr. Bear.
What's up, Mr. Bear?

05:12.906 --> 05:14.031
Andy?

05:20.823 --> 05:23.823
Son, this has got to stop.

05:24.739 --> 05:28.823
Our house is not a television station.
There's not a camera in that wall.

05:29.948 --> 05:33.364
I mean, this is not healthy.
You should be outside, playing sports.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.489
But I have my own sports show.

05:36.614 --> 05:39.864
Andy, you know that's not what I meant.
I'm gonna put my foot down.

05:40.031 --> 05:41.698
No more playing alone.

05:41.864 --> 05:44.448
You want to perform,
you have got to have an audience.

05:44.573 --> 05:45.698
They're right there!

05:45.823 --> 05:48.489
That is not an audience. That is plaster.

05:48.614 --> 05:53.114
An audience is made of people.
People who live and breathe.

06:02.656 --> 06:07.698
<i>Andy Kaufman and Howdy Doody present,
The Animal Song!</i>

06:08.239 --> 06:12.489
Now, I'm gonna say the animal,
and then you tell me what it says, okay?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.031
Okay.

06:15.448 --> 06:17.531
"The cow goes

06:17.656 --> 06:18.864
"Moo

06:18.989 --> 06:21.281
"And the cat goes

06:21.448 --> 06:23.364
"Meow, meow

06:24.156 --> 06:26.531
"And the bird goes

06:28.448 --> 06:29.448
"Tweet, tweet

06:29.573 --> 06:30.906
"Tweet, tweet

06:31.531 --> 06:33.989
"And the lion goes

06:34.406 --> 06:36.073
<i>"Roar</i>

06:36.864 --> 06:38.948
<i>"And the dog goes</i>

06:39.739 --> 06:41.739
<i>"And the cat goes</i>

06:41.864 --> 06:42.573
"Meow

06:42.698 --> 06:44.781
<i>"And the bird goes</i>

06:45.031 --> 06:45.864
"Tweet

06:45.989 --> 06:47.864
<i>"And the pig goes</i>

06:48.031 --> 06:48.864
"Oink

06:48.989 --> 06:54.781
<i>"And that's the way it goes"</i>

06:55.114 --> 06:58.864
<i>The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

07:01.489 --> 07:03.989
So, Mr. Besserman,
same spot tomorrow?

07:05.198 --> 07:08.448
I don't know, Andy.
I think I have to let you go.

07:11.989 --> 07:13.656
You're firing me?

07:15.281 --> 07:17.198
You don't even pay me.

07:17.406 --> 07:21.198
<i>I don't want to seem insulting,
but your act is like Amateur Hour.</i>

07:21.323 --> 07:25.739
You're doing sing-alongs for 6-year-olds,
puppets that aren't funny, playing records.

07:25.864 --> 07:29.531
But it's totally original.
I mean, no one's ever done it.

07:29.656 --> 07:31.114
I'm not like everyone else.

07:31.239 --> 07:33.781
Everybody else gets this place cooking.

07:33.906 --> 07:37.156
It was cooking. There was a man
over here that was really upset.

07:37.281 --> 07:40.489
He stormed out, and many people left
in the middle of your act.

07:40.614 --> 07:42.698
I can't sell booze to people walking out.

07:42.823 --> 07:44.864
It's just about booze, not comedy or art.

07:44.989 --> 07:47.656
<i>I can't sell booze when you sing,
Pop Goes the Weasel.</i>

07:47.739 --> 07:48.864
Booze is all that matters.

07:48.989 --> 07:51.448
I'm running a business here.
It's show business.

07:51.823 --> 07:53.364
Show. Business.

07:53.531 --> 07:57.364
Show. Business.
Without the "business" there's no "show".

07:57.698 --> 07:59.281
And there's no show for you.

07:59.406 --> 08:02.073
What do you want me to do?
"Take my wife, please!"

08:02.198 --> 08:04.948
Well, at least it's a joke. Try some jokes.

08:05.073 --> 08:07.948
Like: Why did the Siamese twins
go to England?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.739
I don't know. Why did they go to England?

08:10.864 --> 08:13.114
So the other one could drive.

08:16.948 --> 08:20.239
Why doesn't the other one
just learn how to drive?

08:20.864 --> 08:23.989
Maybe that one isn't for you,
but do jokes about the traffic.

08:24.114 --> 08:26.948
Do impressions.
Maybe some blue material.

08:57.281 --> 08:59.406
<i>Thank you very much. Good night!</i>

09:07.781 --> 09:09.739
IMPROVISATION

09:25.323 --> 09:27.364
Now?

09:29.448 --> 09:31.239
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

09:35.364 --> 09:39.573
<i>One thing I do not like is too much traffic.</i>

09:41.156 --> 09:42.239
<i>You know?</i>

09:44.448 --> 09:48.906
<i>Tonight I had to come from...</i>

09:54.114 --> 09:58.281
<i>And the freeway, it was so much traffic.</i>

10:00.739 --> 10:03.531
<i>It took me an hour and a half to get here.</i>

10:07.239 --> 10:11.198
<i>But, talking about the terrible things...</i>

10:12.906 --> 10:17.573
<i>My wife, take my wife. Please take her!</i>

10:19.656 --> 10:21.281
<i>No.</i>

10:22.989 --> 10:24.573
<i>I'm only kidding.</i>

10:29.864 --> 10:35.073
<i>I love my wife.
But she don't know how to cook.</i>

10:35.364 --> 10:38.948
<i>Her cooking is so bad. It's terrible.</i>

10:41.031 --> 10:45.781
<i>Now, I would like to do for you...</i>

10:47.031 --> 10:48.448
<i>... the imitations.</i>

10:49.364 --> 10:54.031
<i>I would like to start with Jimmy Carter.</i>

10:55.114 --> 10:57.698
<i>The President of the United States.</i>

11:02.281 --> 11:05.531
<i>Hello. I am Jimmy Carter...</i>

11:06.698 --> 11:09.073
<i>... the President of the United States.</i>

11:16.823 --> 11:18.614
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

11:23.948 --> 11:26.364
<i>Now, I would like to do for you...</i>

11:30.489 --> 11:31.989
<i>... the Elvis Presley.</i>

12:46.614 --> 12:48.948
<i>"Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show</i>

12:49.073 --> 12:51.281
<i>"Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go</i>

12:51.406 --> 12:54.489
<i>"But don't you
step on my blue suede shoes</i>

12:56.323 --> 13:00.239
<i>"You can do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes</i>

13:00.739 --> 13:02.406
<i>"Let's go, cat! "</i>

13:06.823 --> 13:09.198
Budd, what's the story with this guy?

13:09.323 --> 13:11.239
I think he's from Lithuania.

13:11.781 --> 13:14.614
<i>"Well, it's a blue, blue suede shoes baby</i>

13:17.281 --> 13:19.656
<i>"Well, it's a blue, blue suede shoes baby</i>

13:21.948 --> 13:26.323
<i>"You can do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes</i>

13:26.864 --> 13:29.323
<i>"Oh well, we were dancin'</i>

13:30.864 --> 13:34.448
<i>"We were dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

13:37.656 --> 13:38.989
<i>"All right! "</i>

14:03.489 --> 14:05.281
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

14:06.864 --> 14:09.198
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

14:09.323 --> 14:13.364
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I really liked what you did out there.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.281
Thank you very much.

14:17.614 --> 14:20.323
So, I understand you're from Lithuania.

14:20.448 --> 14:23.864
No. I am from Caspiar.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.656
Caspiar, huh?

14:27.781 --> 14:31.448
It is a very small island in the Caspian Sea.

14:32.864 --> 14:33.989
It sunk.

14:35.656 --> 14:37.448
I'm sorry.

14:38.198 --> 14:41.406
Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind...

14:41.864 --> 14:45.948
...but I think you're very interesting,
and if you ever need representation...

14:46.073 --> 14:47.573
...we should talk.

14:47.698 --> 14:48.614
Okay.

14:51.698 --> 14:53.073
"George Shapiro".

14:53.198 --> 14:54.823
Mr. Shapiro!

14:58.406 --> 14:59.989
It is an honor, sir.

15:00.614 --> 15:02.073
Caspiar, huh?

15:02.489 --> 15:05.073
I want to be the biggest star in the world.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.573
People love comedians.

15:08.698 --> 15:12.031
I'm not a comedian. I don't do jokes.
I don't know what's funny.

15:12.156 --> 15:14.239
I'm a song-and-dance man.

15:14.781 --> 15:15.448
Yeah.

15:15.573 --> 15:16.906
Thank you.

15:17.114 --> 15:19.823
I particularly suggest the lotus root.

15:34.281 --> 15:37.489
You show a lot of promise,
and my concern is...

15:37.656 --> 15:40.989
...I don't know where to book you.
You're not a standup...

15:42.906 --> 15:46.573
...and your act doesn't exactly
translate itself to film, so...

15:53.739 --> 15:56.614
So, help me. Where do you see yourself?

15:58.281 --> 16:01.156
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.

16:02.573 --> 16:04.031
That's funny.

16:08.073 --> 16:10.948
See, I don't want to go for cheap laughs.

16:11.489 --> 16:13.864
I want real gut reactions.
I want the audience...

16:13.989 --> 16:15.614
...to have gone through an experience.

16:15.739 --> 16:18.448
They love me, they hate me, they walk out.

16:18.573 --> 16:20.114
It's all great!

16:20.406 --> 16:22.489
Andy, you got a little something.

16:28.364 --> 16:33.198
When I'm famous, I'm gonna sell these.
"As worn by Andy Kaufman".

16:34.156 --> 16:37.281
You can have this one.
It's probably gonna be worth a lot...

16:37.406 --> 16:39.948
...'cause it was actually up my nose.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.031
You're insane!

16:46.406 --> 16:48.781
But you might also be brilliant.

16:50.364 --> 16:51.406
HOLLYWOOD

16:51.531 --> 16:53.406
<i>Hello? George Shapiro here.</i>

16:53.531 --> 16:56.906
<i>Yeah. Is this George Shapiro?</i>

16:57.031 --> 16:58.364
Yeah, speaking.

16:58.489 --> 17:02.906
<i>Speaking! Reeking, seeking, creaking.
Freaking. Big freakin' deal!</i>

17:03.573 --> 17:05.656
<i>Tell me somethin' I don't know, toadstool!</i>

17:05.781 --> 17:07.073
Can I help you with something?

17:07.198 --> 17:09.364
<i>Yeah, you stay away from Andy Kaufman...</i>

17:09.489 --> 17:12.489
<i>... if you know what's good for you!
Crankshaft!</i>

17:12.614 --> 17:13.864
Who is this?

17:13.989 --> 17:16.281
<i>Do not twist my noodle, toy poodle!</i>

17:16.531 --> 17:17.823
<i>This is Tony Clifton!</i>

17:17.948 --> 17:21.739
<i>A name to respect! A name to fear!
And Kaufman is a lying bastard!</i>

17:21.989 --> 17:23.531
<i>He is a psychopath!</i>

17:24.781 --> 17:28.114
Now, slowly open your eyes.

17:30.198 --> 17:34.239
You should feel rested, relaxed and alert.

17:36.531 --> 17:39.573
I would like to thank you, Your Holiness.

17:40.864 --> 17:44.156
My heart is radiating pure energy.

17:46.989 --> 17:49.156
- Okay.
- No, wait.

17:50.239 --> 17:51.323
I'm sorry.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.239
I have a question.

17:59.281 --> 18:02.031
Is there a secret to being funny?

18:05.531 --> 18:06.406
Yes.

18:07.906 --> 18:08.948
Silence.

18:10.698 --> 18:11.698
APPLAUSE

18:19.031 --> 18:21.323
<i>Welcome back to Saturday Night Live.

<i>... as a special treat on our first show,
musical guest, Andy Kaufman!</i>

18:34.864 --> 18:35.573
APPLAUSE

18:59.364 --> 19:01.489
What's wrong with this guy?

19:06.823 --> 19:09.073
This is dead air.

19:22.323 --> 19:26.198
<i>"Mr. Trouble never hangs around</i>

19:26.364 --> 19:29.989
<i>"When he hears this mighty sound</i>

Mr. Kaufman?

20:25.198 --> 20:26.156
Hi.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.906
- Right this way, please.
- Okay.

20:28.031 --> 20:29.823
George is expecting you.

20:32.406 --> 20:33.406
Andy.

20:35.614 --> 20:37.198
Thanks for coming out.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.406
- Thank you, George.
- Come on, sit down.

20:41.948 --> 20:43.614
- Which one?
- Either one.

20:43.698 --> 20:45.114
They're both red.

20:47.031 --> 20:48.448
This one, I guess.

20:48.573 --> 20:50.323
So, did you have a nice flight?

20:50.448 --> 20:52.573
I did. I had a really good flight.

20:52.739 --> 20:55.406
And the stewardess was very nice...

20:55.614 --> 20:57.906
...and she allowed me
to keep my headphones.

20:58.531 --> 20:59.823
That's terrific!

20:59.948 --> 21:00.948
Yeah!

21:01.906 --> 21:02.781
Andy.

21:03.156 --> 21:05.114
I got something better.

21:05.239 --> 21:06.656
- You do?
- Yeah.

21:07.114 --> 21:08.281
This is big.

21:08.698 --> 21:09.864
Okay.

21:11.156 --> 21:11.781
Okay?

21:11.906 --> 21:12.531
Okay.

21:12.614 --> 21:17.323
You are getting a once-in-a-lifetime,
very lucrative opportunity...

21:17.614 --> 21:21.781
...to star on a prime time network sitcom!

21:27.698 --> 21:28.573
A sitcom?

21:28.698 --> 21:32.198
Yeah! And this is a class act.

21:33.114 --> 21:35.614
It all takes place in a taxi stand.

21:36.031 --> 21:38.198
And you're gonna be the Fonzie.

21:41.948 --> 21:42.781
Fonzie?

21:42.906 --> 21:44.448
No.

21:45.239 --> 21:50.073
The Fonzie. The crazy breakout character
who all the kids imitate...

21:50.198 --> 21:52.573
...and they put them on the lunch boxes.

21:52.698 --> 21:55.489
I hate sitcoms, George.
I've never liked them.

21:55.573 --> 21:58.489
These guys have seen
your foreign-man character.

21:59.114 --> 22:01.906
And they want to turn him into...

22:02.698 --> 22:05.948
...a lovable, goofy mechanic named...

22:11.823 --> 22:12.948
...Latka.

22:19.656 --> 22:20.531
No.

22:20.823 --> 22:21.823
- No?
- No.

22:22.073 --> 22:23.114
No to which part?

22:23.239 --> 22:26.198
No to the whole thing.
It doesn't sound good to me.

22:26.281 --> 22:28.614
Andy, this is every comedian's dream!

22:29.114 --> 22:31.073
I'm not a comedian, George.

22:31.239 --> 22:34.531
And sitcoms are the lowest form
of entertainment.

22:34.823 --> 22:39.406
I mean, it's just stupid jokes
and canned laughter!

22:39.656 --> 22:42.114
And you don't know why it's there,
but it's there.

22:42.198 --> 22:45.698
It's dead people laughing, did you
know that? Those people are dead!

22:45.823 --> 22:47.573
Andy, this is classy.

22:48.073 --> 22:49.323
I don't care.

22:50.198 --> 22:53.739
I want to generate my own material.

22:54.489 --> 22:56.989
Look, listen. Listen to me.

22:58.114 --> 23:00.614
I've been in this business
for 20 years, Andy!

23:00.739 --> 23:03.281
I know, I've seen this! I know this!

23:03.448 --> 23:07.031
If you pass up this opportunity,
you will never...

23:07.948 --> 23:10.406
...never see another one like it again.

23:11.448 --> 23:12.406
Never!

23:24.198 --> 23:25.073
Okay.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.364
I'll do it.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.906
But I have some terms.

23:29.031 --> 23:32.948
Sure. That's what negotiations
are all about.

23:36.823 --> 23:38.156
What are you doing?

23:38.281 --> 23:40.323
I'm writing out my terms.

23:52.073 --> 23:53.406
Are you making fun of me?

23:53.531 --> 23:54.614
Those are my terms.

23:54.739 --> 23:56.239
This is ridiculous, Andy!

23:56.364 --> 23:58.489
It's what I need to do the show.

23:58.698 --> 23:59.989
What is this?

24:00.156 --> 24:03.239
"Four guaranteed guest spots
for Tony Clifton".

24:03.364 --> 24:04.614
Who's Tony Clifton?

24:04.739 --> 24:06.864
He's a Vegas lounge singer.

24:07.614 --> 24:11.073
I used to do impressions of him,
and we kinda got into a fight over it.

24:11.198 --> 24:12.531
This Clifton called me!

24:12.656 --> 24:13.239
He did?

24:13.364 --> 24:15.531
He's a loon! He hates you!

24:16.031 --> 24:18.906
No. He just talks tough. But I owe him.

24:19.656 --> 24:24.364
And if I'm the new Fonz,
then ABC is just gonna have to...

24:24.948 --> 24:26.906
...give me what I want!

24:29.698 --> 24:33.573
<i>"Mr. Kaufman will only appear
in half the episodes of Taxi.</i>

24:34.323 --> 24:39.698

90 minutes of meditation prior to filming.

24:56.073 --> 24:57.198
Tony Clifton.

24:57.323 --> 24:59.573
Who the hell is Tony Clifton?

25:02.823 --> 25:04.281
I don't know.

25:08.531 --> 25:10.906
<i>And now, Mama Rivoli's

<i>... your cigars and cigarettes, please.</i>

25:49.656 --> 25:52.114
Goddamn, I paid $10 for that cigar!

25:53.031 --> 25:54.031
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

25:54.156 --> 25:55.073

28:15.198 --> 28:16.406
<i>Gorsky.</i>

28:17.364 --> 28:18.198
<i>Gorsky?</i>

28:18.323 --> 28:20.281
<i>- That Polish?
- Yeah.</i>

28:21.031 --> 28:22.864
<i>You tryin' to do some Polish humor?</i>

28:22.989 --> 28:24.406
<i>- No, that's...
- Shut up!</i>

28:24.614 --> 28:25.823
That's just my name.

28:25.948 --> 28:26.781
<i>Shut up!</i>

28:26.906 --> 28:28.989
<i>I do not appreciate racial slurs!</i>

28:29.323 --> 28:32.073
<i>I think them dumb Polacks

28:32.198 --> 28:33.781
<i>I do a clean show here!</i>

28:33.906 --> 28:35.281
<i>You wanna see some humor?</i>

28:35.406 --> 28:39.614
<i>Here's some humor, right here.
There's some humor, right there, okay!</i>

28:40.448 --> 28:43.198
<i>You just sit down and enjoy that, okay?</i>

28:43.364 --> 28:45.198
<i>And you! Shapiro!</i>

28:46.114 --> 28:48.364
<i>I'll see you backstage, baldy.</i>

28:48.948 --> 28:53.364
<i>"Volare"</i>

29:01.739 --> 29:03.406
What do you want?

29:13.073 --> 29:16.114
Just a little friendly conversation, George.

29:16.781 --> 29:18.948
You hungry? You look thin!

29:24.323 --> 29:27.448
<i>"Italiano, cacciatore, scaloppine,
pasta fasool! "</i>

29:31.198 --> 29:33.406
I don't understand this act.

29:33.989 --> 29:37.239
It's good, old-fashioned entertainment.
Everyone loves a villain.

29:37.364 --> 29:39.573
What about that poor schlep
you humiliated?

29:39.698 --> 29:41.489
Hey, man, excellent show.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.281
- That was a great show.
- Yeah, good show for you.

29:45.114 --> 29:48.156
George, this is my writer and old friend,
Bob Zmuda.

29:48.281 --> 29:50.989
- How are you? I'm Bob.
- He's very creative.

29:51.114 --> 29:54.989
- Yes, I'm the brains behind this operation.
- Yeah, dream on.

29:55.781 --> 29:59.239
He once faked a lion escaping
from the Chicago Zoo.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.281
This was fantastic, George.

30:01.406 --> 30:04.239
We got like 40 actors and they're tearin'
through the zoo.

30:04.364 --> 30:06.281
They shut the place down for two days.

30:06.406 --> 30:09.073
They're screamin', "There's a fuckin' lion!"

30:10.531 --> 30:12.489
Your name's not Gorsky.

30:14.448 --> 30:16.698
Don't believe everything you hear, George.

30:16.823 --> 30:18.656
This cannot leave this room.

30:19.073 --> 30:20.698
Do not write this down.

30:20.823 --> 30:21.823
Okay?

30:22.156 --> 30:24.739
Tony Clifton is Andy Kaufman.

30:26.406 --> 30:28.864
And Andy Kaufman is Tony Clifton.

30:29.114 --> 30:32.239
They'll deny it up and down,
but believe me, it's true.

30:33.864 --> 30:35.573
This is great business.

30:35.989 --> 30:38.864
You get two Andy Kaufmans
for the price of one.

30:44.114 --> 30:45.198
Andy!

30:45.323 --> 30:46.989
- Andy.
- What's up?

30:47.406 --> 30:48.531
They said, "Yes".

30:48.656 --> 30:51.406
You're gettin' everything. Everything!

30:54.531 --> 30:56.614
- Bonus. Bonus!
- Whatever you want.

30:56.739 --> 30:59.489
- Thank you very much.
- It was so good.

30:59.781 --> 31:02.823
<i>- I have to do Taxi, don't I?
- You gotta do Taxi.</i>

31:20.823 --> 31:22.739
Party time for Latka.

31:22.906 --> 31:25.156
Not until you take off those overalls.

31:25.281 --> 31:26.781
This is a good party.

31:28.323 --> 31:31.073
No! Latka, listen to me. Listen to me.

31:31.198 --> 31:33.489
There's a drug in those cookies.

31:34.531 --> 31:35.531
No?

31:35.823 --> 31:37.406
- Yeah.
- No.

31:38.156 --> 31:39.156
No!

31:46.739 --> 31:47.739
Bed?

31:48.281 --> 31:53.031
I have never been so emotional
in all my life!

31:53.323 --> 31:56.448
And this is for my mother!
And this is for my father!

31:56.573 --> 31:58.656
And this is for my grandfather!

32:00.739 --> 32:03.073
I hope you have a small family.

32:18.448 --> 32:20.781
Thank you very much.

32:30.656 --> 32:32.698
- I'm gonna quit.
- What?

32:32.864 --> 32:34.823
Every show is worse than the last one.

32:34.948 --> 32:38.114
Forty million people are watching your ass
every week, Kaufman.

32:38.239 --> 32:39.406
What do they know?

32:39.531 --> 32:41.948
Absolutely nothing! And that's the beauty.

32:42.073 --> 32:44.198
Man, look, it's credibility.

32:44.323 --> 32:48.073
You make them love you now,
and then later on, on your special...

32:48.198 --> 32:51.573
...you can fuck with their heads.
The sky is the limit, man!

32:56.531 --> 32:58.281
Oh, yeah? I don't care!

33:00.031 --> 33:02.823
Sir, there's a problem
down on the Kaufman special.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.864
They say he's not following
the technical requirements.

33:05.989 --> 33:07.073
Technical?

33:07.739 --> 33:09.323
<i>Thanks for coming on my show.</i>

33:09.448 --> 33:11.364
<i>Thanks for having me on your show.</i>

33:11.489 --> 33:13.906
- Okay. Right now. Roll it!
- No.

33:14.031 --> 33:15.739
It's my special!

33:16.031 --> 33:18.364
I have creative control. Now, roll it!

33:18.573 --> 33:19.448
No!

33:19.614 --> 33:21.323
- Do it, man!
- Andy!

33:22.239 --> 33:25.948
Be careful, please! Only positive energy
allowed behind this point.

33:26.073 --> 33:29.489
I've been hearing fabulous things
about the special.

33:30.531 --> 33:32.864
What? Did we hit a little speed bump?

33:33.573 --> 33:35.156
And his name is Colin.

33:35.281 --> 33:38.364
Kid Genius told me to mess
with the vertical hold.

33:38.489 --> 33:39.948
Show me. Show me.

33:40.364 --> 33:41.823
Show him, Colin.

33:45.823 --> 33:49.281
<i>Thanks for having me on your show, Andy.
Boy, it's sure...</i>

33:56.698 --> 33:58.198
It'll be great!

33:58.323 --> 34:00.489
People will think their TV is broken!

34:00.614 --> 34:03.114
They'll get outta their chairs,
walk over to the TV...

34:03.239 --> 34:07.614
...twist the knobs, call the TV store:
"Hey, I paid a lot of money for that TV!"

34:07.739 --> 34:11.406
They'll bang on the television
and they won't be able to fix it!

34:16.072 --> 34:19.364
Andy, we don't want the viewers
to get out of their chairs.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.947
But it's funny!

34:22.614 --> 34:24.656
It's a practical joke.

34:25.864 --> 34:29.322
The viewer must be able
to see the program.

34:33.406 --> 34:35.822
But, it's only gonna be for 30 seconds.

34:36.156 --> 34:37.031
Five.

34:38.156 --> 34:39.114
Twenty.

34:39.572 --> 34:40.447
Ten.

34:41.489 --> 34:42.322
Deal.

34:45.031 --> 34:46.656
Okay Andy, ten seconds, huh?

34:46.781 --> 34:48.489
Ten seconds, okay.

34:58.239 --> 35:01.656
- Ten seconds is all I really wanted.
- Ten seconds is perfect.

35:04.989 --> 35:07.739
<i>I've been watching you
since I was a little boy, Howdy.</i>

35:07.864 --> 35:10.573
<i>I didn't even know what TV was,
but I was watching you.</i>

35:10.698 --> 35:11.448
Look how cute he is.

35:11.573 --> 35:13.573
<i>You're the first friend in TV
I've ever had.</i>

35:13.698 --> 35:14.698
That is so moving.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.614
<i>You're as real as anyone else
in the show to me.</i>

35:18.114 --> 35:19.531
<i>And I love you.</i>

35:19.656 --> 35:20.573
<i>I really do.</i>

35:20.698 --> 35:22.406
This is not funny.

35:22.781 --> 35:25.239
This is artsy-fartsy shit.

35:25.948 --> 35:27.823
This is the magical part of the show.

35:27.948 --> 35:31.739
The show's not all like this.
It's hysterical! Lt gets very funny.

35:31.948 --> 35:35.614
Christ! We're the Number 1 network.
Can't we afford a decent TV?

35:35.823 --> 35:38.614
No, that's part of the show.

35:39.614 --> 35:40.948
This is part of the show?

35:41.073 --> 35:41.614
Yes.

35:41.739 --> 35:43.406
What do you mean, part of the show?

35:43.531 --> 35:45.698
That's the way Andy wants it,
with the roll.

35:45.823 --> 35:48.698
<i>Thanks, Andy. I love you, too.</i>

35:52.239 --> 35:55.781
Tell Kaufman this network
will never air this program.

35:57.531 --> 35:59.073
Hey, that's Andy Kaufman.

36:00.323 --> 36:01.614
You wanna bet?

36:05.198 --> 36:07.156
Excuse me. Are you Andy Kaufman?

36:09.573 --> 36:11.573
I get that all the time.

36:21.698 --> 36:24.573
This is ridiculous. Take off that apron.

36:27.448 --> 36:28.448
No.

36:28.573 --> 36:31.031
I'd rather work here than at ABC.

36:31.364 --> 36:33.406
I'm sorry. They're a bunch of assholes.

36:33.531 --> 36:35.573
Look, we work in a creative business.

36:35.656 --> 36:38.448
There's no telling
what people are gonna like or dislike.

36:38.573 --> 36:40.698
<i>The only reason why I did Taxi...</i>

36:41.739 --> 36:43.781
...was that I could have my own special.

36:43.906 --> 36:48.031
I know. Well, I'll tell you what.
Let me book you some colleges now.

36:48.281 --> 36:50.073
And then, I'll take the special around.

36:50.198 --> 36:53.739
I'll show it to people
and see if anybody wants to buy it.

36:53.823 --> 36:56.656
We'll have a garage sale.
No, I'm over and out.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.781
- You know, you're not over and out.
- Yeah, I am over and out.

36:59.906 --> 37:01.948
- You can't be.
- I'll show you over and out.

37:02.073 --> 37:04.656
You've got a deal with ABC.
You've gotta honor it.

37:04.781 --> 37:07.698
All right. How much longer
is left on my contract?

37:07.823 --> 37:12.364
Well, you signed for five years, so,
four years and seven months.

37:37.239 --> 37:40.739
<i>Thank you. It's really great to be here.</i>

37:41.031 --> 37:44.448
<i>We're gonna have a great show tonight.
A really good one!</i>

37:46.864 --> 37:49.906
<i>We're gonna start by singing
some songs and...</i>

37:50.114 --> 37:51.406
Do Latka!

37:51.531 --> 37:53.281
<i>- Yeah, Latka!
- What?</i>

37:55.281 --> 37:56.156
<i>Wait!</i>

38:03.823 --> 38:05.864
<i>Excuse me for one second.</i>

38:08.073 --> 38:09.281
- I saw that.
- What?

38:09.364 --> 38:12.281
- Gimme the book.
- No, I'm not going to give you the book.

38:12.406 --> 38:13.114
Is something wrong?

38:13.239 --> 38:14.739
No, everything's okay. Fine.

38:14.864 --> 38:16.406
Hey, can I squeeze your nuts?

38:16.531 --> 38:17.739
Thanks.

38:18.198 --> 38:20.114
They're asking for it.

38:27.531 --> 38:33.281
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
since you're such a special audience...</i>

38:34.989 --> 38:35.823
<i>Yeah!</i>

38:36.114 --> 38:41.448
<i>I am going to reveal,
for the very first time, ever, the real me.</i>

38:42.948 --> 38:44.406
<i>That's right.</i>

38:49.823 --> 38:51.656
<i>I'm actually British.</i>

38:52.698 --> 38:57.448
<i>And though I dabble in clowning,
I do find it so boorish...</i>

38:58.198 --> 38:59.406
<i>... so American.</i>

39:00.614 --> 39:01.906
<i>I prefer the fine arts.</i>

39:01.989 --> 39:05.573
<i>Henceforth, today,
I am going to grace you with a reading...</i>

39:06.156 --> 39:08.573
<i>... of one of the greatest novels
ever written.</i>

39:08.698 --> 39:11.198
<i>The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</i>

39:16.281 --> 39:17.489
<i>Please.</i>

39:19.489 --> 39:21.698
<i>"In my younger
and more vulnerable years...</i>

39:21.781 --> 39:23.156
<i>"... my father gave me some advice...</i>

39:23.281 --> 39:25.823
<i>"... that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since.</i>

39:25.906 --> 39:28.656
<i>"'Whenever you feel like
criticizing anyone, ' he told me...</i>

39:28.781 --> 39:31.156
<i>"'... just remember
that all the people of this world...</i>

39:31.281 --> 39:32.989
<i>"'... haven't had the advantages
that you've had. '</i>

39:33.114 --> 39:36.573
<i>"But we've always been unusually
communicative, in a reserved way.</i>

39:36.698 --> 39:40.656
<i>"And I understood that he meant
a great deal, more than that. "</i>

39:49.364 --> 39:51.198
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

39:56.864 --> 40:00.489
<i>"In consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments.</i>

40:00.614 --> 40:03.406
<i>"A habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me...</i>

40:03.531 --> 40:06.948
<i>"... and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bones. "</i>

40:07.073 --> 40:07.989
Oh, come on!

40:08.114 --> 40:12.489
<i>No. Please keep it down.
We've got a long way to go.</i>

40:13.531 --> 40:16.781
<i>"They were the same people,
or at least the same sort of people...</i>

40:16.906 --> 40:18.739
<i>"... the same profusion of cham... "</i>

40:18.864 --> 40:21.948
<i>I tell you what.
Would you rather I kept reading...</i>

40:22.156 --> 40:24.698
<i>... or do you prefer to hear
the phonograph record?</i>

40:24.781 --> 40:25.989
Record!

40:26.114 --> 40:27.406
<i>I'm sorry, I can't hear you.</i>

40:27.531 --> 40:28.864
Record!

40:29.114 --> 40:30.781
<i>Are you positive?</i>

40:32.073 --> 40:33.489
<i>Very well then.</i>

40:33.614 --> 40:35.031
Yeah, Mighty Mouse!

40:40.948 --> 40:44.948
<i>"Perhaps his presence gave the evening
its peculiar quality of oppressiveness.</i>

40:45.073 --> 40:49.448
<i>"It stands out in my memory
from Gatsby's other parties that summer.</i>

40:50.031 --> 40:52.698
<i>"The green light, the orgiastic future...</i>

40:52.781 --> 40:55.323
<i>"... year by year recedes before us.</i>

41:00.114 --> 41:01.239
<i>"Tomorrow...</i>

41:03.323 --> 41:05.989
<i>"Tomorrow, we will run faster...</i>

41:06.364 --> 41:08.573
<i>"... stretch our arms out further...</i>

41:09.531 --> 41:11.489
<i>"... and one fine morning...</i>

41:12.698 --> 41:16.281
<i>"So we beat on,
boats against the current...</i>

41:16.698 --> 41:19.281
<i>"... born back ceaselessly...</i>

41:20.781 --> 41:22.198
<i>"... into the past.</i>

41:25.406 --> 41:26.406
<i>"The end. "</i>

41:29.281 --> 41:30.364
All right!

41:53.448 --> 41:55.448
You wanna play Arizona State?

41:55.573 --> 41:58.781
You give them Mighty Mouse.
You give them Elvis.

41:59.031 --> 42:01.364
<i>I gave them, The Great Gatsby.</i>

42:01.573 --> 42:03.489
F. Scott Fitzgerald's best work.

42:03.614 --> 42:05.739
- A classic.
- His finest piece of work.

42:05.823 --> 42:07.323
I don't care!

42:12.906 --> 42:18.323
Andy. You have to look inside
and ask this question:

42:19.406 --> 42:23.698
Who are you trying to entertain?
The audience or yourself?

42:25.864 --> 42:27.198
Excuse me.

42:31.906 --> 42:33.698
- Bob.
- What, George?

42:34.073 --> 42:37.739
I'm worried about Andy. This is not good.

42:37.864 --> 42:39.948
His stress level is affecting his work!

42:40.073 --> 42:43.073
Calm down now, George.
That's not gonna help anything, okay?

42:43.198 --> 42:47.989
<i>Look, Tony Clifton is gonna go
on Taxi next week.</i>

42:48.573 --> 42:53.364
That should let him blow off steam
and relieve the stress. Okay?

42:53.489 --> 42:57.239
Bob, Andy needs to relax. This is your job.

42:57.364 --> 43:00.114
You have to take him away from all of this.

43:03.781 --> 43:05.114
Would you, come on?

43:05.198 --> 43:06.489
Come on!

43:07.323 --> 43:08.489
Shit!

43:08.989 --> 43:10.364
Hi, how you doin' today?

43:10.448 --> 43:11.573
Fine. Great.

43:11.698 --> 43:13.489
Hello. Nice to meet you.

43:13.864 --> 43:16.198
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

43:16.406 --> 43:17.614
Peachy.

43:30.114 --> 43:32.239
What do we do now?

43:32.573 --> 43:33.781
Now, you pick.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.739
But what if I hurt somebody's feelings?

43:39.156 --> 43:42.156
For Christ's sake, you're not gonna hurt
anybody's feelings.

43:42.281 --> 43:43.989
They're all professionals.

43:45.239 --> 43:46.364
Okay.

43:52.906 --> 43:54.739
All right, which one?

43:56.948 --> 43:58.281
I will have both!

44:04.239 --> 44:05.948
<i>I will have this Fraulein.</i>

44:06.614 --> 44:10.573
<i>Und the one with the big strudels.
Mach schnell, mach schnell!</i>

44:12.906 --> 44:14.323
Zmuda, I'm gonna kill you.

44:14.448 --> 44:16.114
Excellent choice.

44:17.448 --> 44:18.614
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:18.948 --> 44:21.031
Are you having a good day?

44:22.698 --> 44:26.948
It's kind of a big day.
It's my buddy's first time with a prostitute.

44:27.239 --> 44:30.989
What are you talking about?
Andy comes here almost every weekend.

44:32.448 --> 44:33.781
Who, Andy?

44:34.239 --> 44:36.489
He doesn't always call himself that.

44:36.698 --> 44:39.406
Sometimes he's Tony and he wears a tux.

45:04.573 --> 45:07.989
If I gave you both $300...

45:08.489 --> 45:10.031
...would you...

45:13.739 --> 45:17.281
...come to Hollywood
and help me destroy a TV show?

45:20.239 --> 45:21.073
$500.

45:28.114 --> 45:29.948
What am I, Harry Houdini?

45:31.448 --> 45:34.114
We busted through. Come on, girls.

45:34.406 --> 45:36.614
Welcome to the Follies Bree-gere!

45:36.739 --> 45:38.781
Okay, here's the man, Tony Clifton!

45:38.906 --> 45:42.073
- Taxi, laxy, just the factsy, Maxie!
- Hi.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.364
Hey, hotshot. How're you doing?

45:44.531 --> 45:48.281
- Ed Weinberger, Executive.
- Take a hike! Okay, all right?

45:49.448 --> 45:51.114
What are we doing, huh?

45:51.239 --> 45:52.698
Here's your script, Tony.

45:52.823 --> 45:54.781
- That's the script I was given?
- Yeah.

45:54.906 --> 45:56.448
- That's the one I have to do?
- Yeah.

45:56.573 --> 45:57.739
Okay, let me see.

45:57.864 --> 46:00.948
Okay. Bullshit, bullshit, my line.

46:01.281 --> 46:03.489
Bullshit, bullshit, my line.

46:04.573 --> 46:06.948
That's hilarious!

46:07.156 --> 46:11.406
You know, I reviewed that script last night
and I was not satisfied.

46:11.531 --> 46:13.906
- Yeah, well...
- I was not satisfied.

46:14.031 --> 46:16.698
- Well, why don't we just...
- Listen, I made some changes.

46:16.781 --> 46:19.781
I stayed up all night
with these sweet ladies right here...

46:19.906 --> 46:21.573
This is Lemonade.

46:22.364 --> 46:25.364
- Can we get to work?
- That'll keep you going on a hot day.

46:25.489 --> 46:26.948
And this is Melonia.

46:27.073 --> 46:29.614
How's my little produce department?

46:33.114 --> 46:35.364
<i>This is the new Taxi theme song.</i>

46:40.948 --> 46:43.989
"We drive a taxi"

46:56.156 --> 46:57.114
George.

46:58.781 --> 47:03.989
I can't afford to blow this whole episode,
so, we have to let him go.

47:07.489 --> 47:09.489
I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this.

47:09.614 --> 47:12.573
Well, we just have to go down and tell him.

47:13.239 --> 47:16.031
But that's Tony down there. It's not Andy.

47:16.239 --> 47:19.614
I don't give a fuck who that is,
I'm gonna fire him.

47:19.739 --> 47:23.281
Okay, all right.
But we better warn Andy first.

47:23.489 --> 47:27.614
He's up in San Francisco, doing a concert.
I'll call my secretary.

47:31.364 --> 47:33.364
Diane, this is George.

47:33.573 --> 47:36.531
I'm trying to reach Andy
up in San Francisco.

47:36.656 --> 47:37.781
<i>Okay.</i>

47:38.698 --> 47:39.989
<i>I'll patch you through.</i>

47:40.114 --> 47:41.239
I'll wait.

47:43.406 --> 47:44.073
<i>Hello?</i>

47:44.198 --> 47:46.948
Andy. I'm gonna put you on the speaker.

47:47.698 --> 47:48.906
<i>- Hello, Andy.
- Hello?</i>

47:49.031 --> 47:51.698
<i>Hi. I'm here with Ed, over at Taxi.</i>

47:51.823 --> 47:53.031
<i>- Hi, Ed.
- Hi, Andy.</i>

47:53.239 --> 47:54.656
<i>- How are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

47:54.781 --> 47:55.364
<i>Good.</i>

47:55.489 --> 47:57.823
Andy, there's been some trouble
with Tony.

47:57.989 --> 48:00.364
<i>Oh, no! Did he get hurt?</i>

48:00.948 --> 48:01.448
No.

48:01.573 --> 48:03.698
No, Andy, it's nothing like that, no.

48:03.823 --> 48:06.739
<i>- Did he hurt someone else?
- No, it's not that.</i>

48:06.864 --> 48:10.156
Andy, the reason I'm calling you
like this is...

48:10.281 --> 48:13.114
I have the utmost respect for your artistry.

48:13.239 --> 48:16.739
<i>Well, may I say
that I've always appreciated that, Ed.</i>

48:16.864 --> 48:20.031
Thank you. But you see, in this instance...

48:21.156 --> 48:24.531
I have to ask your permission to fire Tony.

48:31.823 --> 48:35.948
<i>George, this is gonna kill Tony.
He's waited for this his whole life.</i>

48:36.073 --> 48:37.739
Andy, there'll be other shots.

48:37.864 --> 48:40.823
Yeah, we have to do this.
He's just a terrible actor.

48:42.073 --> 48:45.823
Okay. But please, let him down gently.

48:46.698 --> 48:47.739
Trust us.

48:47.864 --> 48:50.448
Fuck you! I'm not going!

48:52.906 --> 48:54.073
We had a deal.

48:54.323 --> 48:57.573
I know who you talked to.
You must have talked to someone else!

48:57.698 --> 48:59.614
Yeah! I was talking to Andy Kaufman!

48:59.739 --> 49:01.989
I don't know no Andy Kaufman!

49:02.406 --> 49:03.656
Security, get in here!

49:03.781 --> 49:05.656
He is ruining my life!

49:06.448 --> 49:08.406
Security! Get in here!

49:23.948 --> 49:26.239
Do not hurt him! He's a talented man!

49:26.364 --> 49:28.573
I don't want any pictures leaving this set!

49:28.698 --> 49:29.989
Hey! Give that back! Hey!

49:30.114 --> 49:32.323
Get Zmuda, he's one of them!

49:34.239 --> 49:37.614
If you guys ever go to Vegas,
you're not getting in!

49:38.823 --> 49:41.823
Hey, come here! Give me the camera!
Come here! Come on!

49:41.948 --> 49:43.489
Give me the camera!

49:43.739 --> 49:46.406
I got $20 says you work for me now!

49:46.489 --> 49:48.573
I would like to use the phone!

49:49.198 --> 49:50.364
Not on the lot, sir.

49:50.489 --> 49:53.156
How about a bathroom?
I may have shit my pants.

49:54.864 --> 49:56.073
- Drink of water?
- No.

49:56.198 --> 49:57.156
- Aspirin?
- No.

49:57.281 --> 49:59.114
- Moist towelette?
- No.

49:59.739 --> 50:03.114
In that case, it has been an honor
and a good-bye!

50:04.073 --> 50:05.489
WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?

50:05.614 --> 50:06.781
This is great!

50:07.281 --> 50:11.239
This is too much, man.
It makes Tony real, you know?

50:11.364 --> 50:13.656
It gives him three dimensions.

50:14.406 --> 50:16.864
It's good for his career, George.

50:17.156 --> 50:21.239
Oh, really? You want to book Tony Clifton
at Harrah's Tahoe?

50:21.364 --> 50:24.114
Well, I know the college kids
really like Andy Kaufman.

50:24.239 --> 50:28.281
No, look Gene, let me be really clear
about this.

50:28.448 --> 50:31.323
<i>If you book Tony,
do not expect to get Andy.</i>

50:31.614 --> 50:35.073
Well, you know what,
I'll take my chances, all right?

50:37.156 --> 50:39.489
All right. Be my guest. Book him.

50:43.531 --> 50:44.698
<i>Shut up!</i>

50:47.281 --> 50:49.948
<i>Shut the hell up! All of ya!</i>

50:50.364 --> 50:52.823
<i>You make one more sound,
I'll come down there...</i>

50:52.948 --> 50:55.156
<i>... and put your friggin' head in the soup!</i>

50:56.073 --> 50:59.364
<i>When I go like this,
it means I expect total silence!</i>

51:01.198 --> 51:03.989
<i>There is an artiste on stage.</i>

51:18.698 --> 51:20.364
<i>That's better.</i>

51:28.323 --> 51:29.989
<i>"Oh, whether I'm right</i>

51:31.573 --> 51:33.406
<i>"Or whether I'm wrong</i>

51:34.948 --> 51:40.739
<i>"Or whether I find a place in this world
or never belong</i>

51:41.698 --> 51:44.531
<i>"I've got to be me</i>

51:45.073 --> 51:47.989
<i>"I've gotta be me</i>

51:48.656 --> 51:53.656
<i>"Willing to try to do it or die"</i>

52:05.781 --> 52:07.406
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

52:08.489 --> 52:10.781
<i>Thank you. I do all my own stunts.</i>

52:12.989 --> 52:15.239
<i>"I've got to be"</i>

52:23.406 --> 52:25.323
<i>What the hell's goin' on?</i>

52:25.448 --> 52:26.448
<i>Kaufman!</i>

52:36.531 --> 52:38.739
<i>Kaufman's fucking up my act!</i>

52:44.864 --> 52:47.448
<i>Where's it say Kaufman's in the act?</i>

52:53.614 --> 52:55.948
<i>May I borrow this for a second?</i>

53:15.573 --> 53:17.364
<i>Now, you are all wet!</i>

53:18.073 --> 53:21.656
<i>You look like you could use
a little drink up there!</i>

53:21.781 --> 53:23.489
<i>Now, go on, get outta here!</i>

53:23.614 --> 53:25.864
<i>That's what you get
for crapping up my act!</i>

53:25.989 --> 53:26.656
No.

53:26.781 --> 53:29.073
<i>You get out of here, little drummer boy!</i>

53:29.198 --> 53:30.864
Stay! No, wait Andy, come back!

53:30.989 --> 53:33.781
<i>"I've got to be"</i>

53:36.198 --> 53:37.364
Go home!

53:37.864 --> 53:41.406
<i>"Volare"</i>

53:57.656 --> 54:00.948
Jesus Christ. Close the goddamn door.
Close it!

54:03.156 --> 54:04.573
Look at you.

54:05.614 --> 54:06.698
You're so proud.

54:06.823 --> 54:09.614
You're like some stupid kid
who comes home from school:

54:09.739 --> 54:11.531
"Look, Dad, I got an F!"

54:13.489 --> 54:15.073
But wasn't it funny?

54:15.448 --> 54:18.489
"Yes, it was funny, Andy. It was".

54:20.114 --> 54:25.531
Yes, it was funny for a little while, until
the audience realized that Tony wasn't you.

54:29.906 --> 54:32.864
So, what do you have here?
A big elaborate joke...

54:33.198 --> 54:35.781
...that's only funny to two people
in the universe.

54:35.906 --> 54:37.239
You and you.

54:37.573 --> 54:41.073
Sure, George, yeah.
And we happen to think that it's hilarious.

54:44.114 --> 54:45.781
But what's the point?

54:45.906 --> 54:47.781
It's fun, George.

54:51.281 --> 54:54.989
How is this gonna make you
the biggest star in the world?

54:58.448 --> 55:02.406
At this point the audience expects me
to completely shock them, all the time.

55:02.531 --> 55:05.948
But short of faking my own death
or setting the theater on fire...

55:06.073 --> 55:07.739
...I don't know what else to do.

55:07.864 --> 55:10.281
'Cause I've always gotta be
one step ahead of them.

55:13.281 --> 55:14.948
It's like ballet.

55:16.573 --> 55:18.239
Did you see that?

55:19.948 --> 55:22.614
<i>Dropped to the canvas when the two
engaged in a real...</i>

55:22.739 --> 55:24.114
These guys are brilliant.

55:24.239 --> 55:26.823
I want to be a bad guy wrestler
in the worst way.

55:26.948 --> 55:29.323
I hate to break it to you,
but the problem is...

55:29.448 --> 55:31.823
...you don't have the build
or the look for it...

55:31.948 --> 55:34.698
These guys are huge.
They would kick your ass.

55:37.989 --> 55:41.573
Maybe I could pick on someone
a little smaller than me.

55:43.489 --> 55:46.239
No, women are superior to men
in many ways.

55:46.906 --> 55:48.614
MERV!

55:48.739 --> 55:51.489
That's right, when it comes
to cooking and cleaning...

55:51.614 --> 55:54.531
...and washing the potatoes,
scrubbing the carrots...

55:54.698 --> 55:59.239
...making the babies, mopping the floors.
They have it all over men.

55:59.364 --> 56:02.614
I believe that.
But when it comes to wrestling...

56:02.781 --> 56:04.031
<i>Shut up!</i>

56:04.198 --> 56:07.323
<i>Be quiet when the man is talking!</i>

56:10.114 --> 56:12.823
If there is a woman here tonight
who can come up here...

56:12.948 --> 56:17.573
...and prove me wrong.
I will shut my mouth and pay her $500!

56:18.864 --> 56:20.281
I can do it!

56:21.614 --> 56:22.948
Over here! Pick me!

56:23.073 --> 56:24.781
Who's gonna go? Who'll be the victor?

56:24.906 --> 56:26.864
Come on! You want to take me?
Come on!

56:26.989 --> 56:28.698
We'll take one woman! You, ma'am.

56:28.823 --> 56:29.989
What's your name, sweetheart?

56:30.114 --> 56:31.698
- My name is Lynne.
- Lynne.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.656
Lynne is the volunteer, all right.

56:33.781 --> 56:35.448
You're pathetic.

56:35.573 --> 56:37.364
What are you gonna do about it, Suzy Q?

56:37.489 --> 56:38.364
I want a clean fight.

56:38.489 --> 56:40.448
No kicking, biting, scratching, head-butts.

56:40.573 --> 56:42.448
- You understand?
- He's gonna play fair?

56:42.573 --> 56:44.156
I'm not concerned with him...

56:44.281 --> 56:46.948
It's up to you. You pin me.
I don't have to pin you.

56:47.031 --> 56:47.739
Yes, I understand.

56:47.864 --> 56:50.156
Very good. Can we please shake hands?

56:52.281 --> 56:55.406
All right, into your respective corners.
Come out wrestling...

56:55.531 --> 56:57.198
...when you hear the bell.

57:01.948 --> 57:03.989
You see? You see this?

57:09.031 --> 57:10.239
Yeah!

57:14.698 --> 57:16.448
Lynne, no choke holds! I told you!

57:16.573 --> 57:18.073
Yeah! Come on!

57:21.698 --> 57:24.114
Hey, stop right there, Kaufman!

57:25.156 --> 57:26.614
- First warning!
- For what?

57:26.739 --> 57:30.114
You pulled her hair! You won't be getting
a second warning, Kaufman!

57:30.239 --> 57:31.614
That is enough! What'd I do?

57:31.739 --> 57:33.739
Shut up! I am the champion.

57:33.989 --> 57:35.406
No woman can...

57:43.989 --> 57:46.031
I'm mopping up the sweat.

57:52.739 --> 57:55.948
One, two, three.

57:56.073 --> 57:58.739
That is it! Lt is over! Lt is over!

57:59.948 --> 58:01.698
You are out! You are down!

58:01.823 --> 58:04.656
The winner and still undisputed...

58:04.781 --> 58:07.531
...Intergender Wrestling Champion
of the world...

58:07.656 --> 58:09.989
...Andy Kaufman!

58:10.281 --> 58:12.614
I am the winner!

58:13.239 --> 58:15.739
I've got the brains!

58:27.823 --> 58:31.073
Ma'am? Here is your complimentary photo
of Merv.

58:31.198 --> 58:32.781
- Thank you.
- And your Turtle Wax.

58:32.906 --> 58:34.031
I don't want Turtle Wax.

58:34.156 --> 58:36.114
Every guest of Merv's takes Turtle Wax.

58:36.239 --> 58:39.281
And here's your gift voucher
to Red Lobster for dinner for two.

58:39.406 --> 58:40.489
Thank you so much.

58:40.823 --> 58:43.906
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for doing such a great job.

58:44.031 --> 58:46.281
- I really appreciate it.
- Don't patronize me.

58:46.406 --> 58:47.406
No, wait!

58:47.614 --> 58:48.531
What?

58:49.073 --> 58:51.906
I hope you don't take
everything I did in there seriously.

58:52.031 --> 58:54.698
What I was saying, well,
it's just part of the show.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.031
It's like the old days
of the carnival barker...

58:57.156 --> 58:59.406
...when he could get the crowd all riled up.

58:59.531 --> 59:01.489
So, you just pretend to be an asshole?

59:03.239 --> 59:05.239
That's what I'm good at.

59:06.614 --> 59:10.906
Yeah, you are. You are, you are really,
really good at it. You are.

59:19.031 --> 59:22.031
Merv Griffin got 2,000 pieces of hate mail.

59:22.906 --> 59:25.114
Don't make me laugh, George.

59:25.281 --> 59:28.198
Andy, Merv does not get hate mail.

59:28.323 --> 59:31.864
Well, that means we're a success.

59:33.656 --> 59:36.198
We got the room all worked up,
like punk rock.

59:36.323 --> 59:37.906
Andy, they detest you.

59:39.198 --> 59:43.073
The next time you make an appearance
women are gonna picket.

59:43.531 --> 59:44.698
You think so?

59:44.823 --> 59:48.781
Yes, because you have not given them
any clues that this is a parody.

59:49.406 --> 59:51.364
That's because I've only done it once.

59:51.489 --> 59:52.823
They'll get used to it.

59:52.948 --> 59:56.573
'Cause I'm gonna do it again and again,
and again and again.

01:00:36.364 --> 01:00:37.739
Time-out!

01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:46.698
All right, all right, you're out!
You are out! Get...

01:00:56.989 --> 01:01:00.281
Two adults, please. Thank you.

01:01:00.906 --> 01:01:02.239
Do you want some popcorn?

01:01:02.364 --> 01:01:03.656
No, thank you.

01:01:03.781 --> 01:01:05.489
I really want one.

01:01:06.989 --> 01:01:09.531
A large tub of popcorn, please.
Extra butter.

01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:11.156
So, why did you call me?

01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:13.781
You are the last person
I expected to call me.

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:18.823
Gosh, gee, Lynne, I mean,
I was just so impressed...

01:01:18.948 --> 01:01:20.573
...with your wrestling moves, you know?

01:01:20.698 --> 01:01:23.864
Yeah, you were impressed with something.
You had a huge boner...

01:01:23.989 --> 01:01:25.489
...on national TV.

01:01:25.614 --> 01:01:27.906
- Oh, man. Come on.
- Yeah, you did.

01:01:28.114 --> 01:01:30.323
I had it taped down and everything.

01:01:30.448 --> 01:01:31.989
I hope I didn't offend you.

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:33.489
I'm here, aren't I?

01:01:33.614 --> 01:01:34.406
Hey!

01:01:34.823 --> 01:01:37.906
- What?
- Want to go to Memphis and get married?

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:42.489
Do I want to go to Memphis
and get married?

01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:48.031
Why Memphis?

01:01:48.323 --> 01:01:51.448
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital
of the world.

01:01:52.239 --> 01:01:56.031
I'll get up in the ring and I'll announce
that I'll marry the first woman...

01:01:56.156 --> 01:01:58.114
...who beats me. Then you can get up...

01:01:58.239 --> 01:02:01.406
...and we'll wrestle and I'll let you win...
- You'll let me win?

01:02:01.531 --> 01:02:03.489
I'll let you win. I'll let you.

01:02:03.906 --> 01:02:06.239
And then we'll run off
and we'll get married...

01:02:06.364 --> 01:02:08.156
<i>... on the David Letterman Show.</i>

01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:09.114
- God!
- Okay?

01:02:15.114 --> 01:02:16.739
What do you say?

01:02:18.448 --> 01:02:19.656
Is this for real?

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:20.948
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:02:21.156 --> 01:02:21.948
Boo!

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:23.323
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:28.364
<i>I demand silence when I am talking.</i>

01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:32.864
<i>Total lack of respect from Mr. Hollywood.</i>

01:02:32.989 --> 01:02:36.489
<i>If there is one woman here tonight
who thinks she can defeat me...</i>

01:02:36.614 --> 01:02:41.073
<i>... that lucky little lady
will get to marry me!</i>

01:02:42.823 --> 01:02:44.114
<i>Let me ask you, folks:</i>

01:02:44.239 --> 01:02:46.656
<i>What kind of man
would wrestle a woman, anyway?</i>

01:02:46.781 --> 01:02:47.906
Kaufman!

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:51.156
Kaufman!

01:02:53.823 --> 01:02:56.031
I'll take you on, you sissy!

01:02:56.989 --> 01:02:58.823
<i>The little lady is upset.</i>

01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:01.864
<i>Let me tell you somethin', baby.
Go back to the kitchen...</i>

01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:04.406
<i>... where you belong,
before you get hurt, okay?</i>

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.406
<i>No, Kaufman, you get in the kitchen,
'cause I'll make you...</i>

01:03:07.531 --> 01:03:08.531
<i>... do my dishes!</i>

01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:10.114
<i>Hey! Stop it!</i>

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:13.906
<i>Stop it! This woman is a fake!</i>

01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:18.448
<i>She's nothin' more
than Andy Kaufman's girlfriend.</i>

01:03:19.198 --> 01:03:20.073
<i>Right?</i>

01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:22.031
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

01:03:22.614 --> 01:03:23.906
<i>That's not true!</i>

01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:25.281
<i>- Boo!
- That's not true!</i>

01:03:25.406 --> 01:03:26.614
You big faker!

01:03:27.448 --> 01:03:28.739
<i>That is not true!</i>

01:03:28.864 --> 01:03:31.531
<i>Yeah, that's true.
This is all a set-up, Kaufman.</i>

01:03:31.614 --> 01:03:34.073
<i>And I'm not gonna allow you
to fool these people.</i>

01:03:34.198 --> 01:03:35.281
<i>You understand me?</i>

01:03:35.406 --> 01:03:37.031
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

01:03:37.448 --> 01:03:40.489
<i>I'm Jerry Lawler,
the King of Memphis wrestling!</i>

01:03:41.323 --> 01:03:42.281
<i>He's the King!</i>

01:03:42.406 --> 01:03:43.698
Right on!

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:50.198
<i>Kaufman, if you want to wrestle
somebody...</i>

01:03:50.489 --> 01:03:52.281
<i>... I've got a real wrestler.</i>

01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:55.031
<i>She's trained and she's ready.</i>

01:03:55.156 --> 01:03:58.823
<i>Let's see if you can handle Foxy Jackson!
Come on, Foxy!</i>

01:03:58.948 --> 01:03:59.781
<i>Oh, my!</i>

01:03:59.906 --> 01:04:02.781
<i>Foxy Jackson and Andy Kaufman...</i>

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.906
<i>... right here, one-on-one.</i>

01:04:05.323 --> 01:04:06.781
<i>I never agreed to this!</i>

01:04:06.906 --> 01:04:10.989
<i>I will not do this!
Lawler, I did not agree to this!</i>

01:04:11.114 --> 01:04:12.489
<i>This is against the rules!</i>

01:04:12.614 --> 01:04:16.739
<i>I don't think that Kaufman was prepared
for Foxy Jackson.</i>

01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:19.364
<i>Mr. Hollywood.</i>

01:04:22.198 --> 01:04:25.323
<i>Again, Kaufman showing
a total lack of respect.</i>

01:04:25.489 --> 01:04:28.781
<i>Foxy Jackson's gonna take Kaufman
to the woodshed.</i>

01:04:34.656 --> 01:04:37.864
<i>Kaufman hangin' on the ropes
like a little baby!</i>

01:04:38.323 --> 01:04:41.364
<i>Foxy's about to take Kaufman
right out of his shorts!</i>

01:05:03.114 --> 01:05:04.156
One, two, three.

01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:06.406
<i>- Can you believe it? Son of a gun!
- I got her!</i>

01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:08.614
<i>Come on, you wank, get off of her!</i>

01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:10.656
<i>Get him off of her, come on.</i>

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:12.281
<i>Now, there goes the King...</i>

01:05:12.406 --> 01:05:16.198
<i>Oh, man! He just threw Kaufman down
like a rag doll!</i>

01:05:16.656 --> 01:05:18.739
<i>The King took matters into his own hands!</i>

01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:20.406
- You all right?
- Sit her down.

01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:23.531
What are you doing? I do not wrestle men!

01:05:24.114 --> 01:05:26.239
I am gonna sue you, Lawler!

01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:29.281
I am a national TV star...

01:05:29.406 --> 01:05:32.073
...and I don't like dumb, stupid crackers...

01:05:32.198 --> 01:05:34.364
...comin' into the ring, pushin' me around!

01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:36.239
I did not agree to wrestle you!

01:05:36.364 --> 01:05:37.406
I did not agree!

01:05:37.531 --> 01:05:39.614
This is assault and battery!

01:05:39.739 --> 01:05:42.864
And I'm gonna get a team of lawyers
to sue you...

01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:45.864
...and your children,
and your children's children!

01:05:45.989 --> 01:05:48.156
Let me tell you somethin', Kaufman!

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.281
Wrestling's a very serious sport to me!

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:53.323
And I don't appreciate a jerk like you
makin' fun of it!

01:05:53.448 --> 01:05:55.573
I certainly don't appreciate
a jerk like you...

01:05:55.698 --> 01:05:57.531
...makin' fun of people from the South!

01:05:57.656 --> 01:06:00.906
So we can go to court if you want to!
Or you can get in the ring...

01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:02.864
...with a man and wrestle for real!

01:06:02.989 --> 01:06:04.781
You wanna wrestle me?

01:06:05.364 --> 01:06:07.739
You wanna wrestle me, Memphis god?

01:06:08.156 --> 01:06:10.156
Let me tell you somethin', Mr. Lawler.

01:06:10.281 --> 01:06:13.114
I am gonna make you scream for mercy!

01:06:13.364 --> 01:06:15.031
Come on, Kaufman!

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:26.614
They didn't know what hit them!

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:28.198
Is it an act?

01:06:30.448 --> 01:06:33.323
Or are you just addicted
to causing trouble?

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.823
I can quit anytime I want, baby!

01:06:36.989 --> 01:06:41.281
You know what? I'm not a prop.
Don't ever treat me like that again.

01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:43.448
I'm sorry.

01:06:46.989 --> 01:06:50.114
I just get caught up, that's all.

01:06:50.948 --> 01:06:52.948
Sometimes I get lost.

01:06:58.864 --> 01:07:01.698
Please, Andy, enough with the wrestling.

01:07:03.239 --> 01:07:05.156
You don't think that I can beat him?

01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:08.489
He's the southern heavyweight champion!
He'll kill you!

01:07:09.781 --> 01:07:12.948
I don't know. I've wrestled women
that are bigger than him...

01:07:13.073 --> 01:07:15.198
...and I've mopped the floor with 'em.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.948
Well, first you piss off women...

01:07:17.073 --> 01:07:19.781
...then you piss off the South,
then you get killed.

01:07:19.906 --> 01:07:21.198
And I did the booking.

01:07:23.323 --> 01:07:26.864
It's funny. Listen, I got this job
that I want you to take.

01:07:27.073 --> 01:07:29.406
<i>It's guest-hosting
the TV show Fridays.</i>

01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:32.614
It's not a great TV show,
but it'll be good for you.

01:07:33.073 --> 01:07:36.323
<i>It's live, they'll give you
carte blanche...</i>

01:07:36.448 --> 01:07:40.323
...and you can get back in the business
of making people laugh.

01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:42.781
You said "live"?

01:07:42.906 --> 01:07:43.948
Live.

01:07:44.531 --> 01:07:47.531
- I don't do drug humor.
- Andy, it's fine.

01:07:47.656 --> 01:07:50.739
This is what the show is all about.
Kids love this stuff.

01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:54.781
But I don't do drugs,
and I don't enjoy making light of them.

01:07:55.198 --> 01:07:57.406
I was promised creative control.

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.448
No one promised you creative control.

01:07:59.573 --> 01:08:02.323
You got the script three days ago,
and don't say a word...

01:08:02.448 --> 01:08:05.031
...until now. We're on live in minutes.
It's too late.

01:08:05.156 --> 01:08:07.073
Let's go! Bring the audience in!

01:08:07.198 --> 01:08:09.864
<i>- Live from the Los Angeles basin...
- Janice! Lt's on!</i>

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:11.198
<i>... it's Fridays!</i>

01:08:11.573 --> 01:08:13.864
<i>Tonight's special guest star...</i>

01:08:14.239 --> 01:08:17.281
<i>... Andy Kaufman!</i>

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:20.948
<i>In this sketch, two married couples
are out to dinner.</i>

01:08:21.073 --> 01:08:24.113
<i>Everybody has secretly
brought along a joint.</i>

01:08:25.906 --> 01:08:30.448
<i>And Carl was the last one to sneak
to the bathroom to get a little high.</i>

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:33.698
<i>And now he's coming back to the table.</i>

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.031
Restaurants are amazing, aren't they?
All these strangers...

01:08:41.156 --> 01:08:44.448
...just sitting around, stuffing dead animals
into their faces.

01:08:44.573 --> 01:08:45.948
Incredible.

01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:48.738
Yeah. Gee.

01:08:49.406 --> 01:08:51.488
And the bathrooms are...

01:08:51.988 --> 01:08:53.948
<i>... so colorful.</i>

01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:10.613
Everything okay, Carl?

01:09:11.073 --> 01:09:14.156
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:16.323
I can't play stoned.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:20.573
Read the cue cards.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:24.738
I can't play stoned. I feel stupid.

01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:26.406
You feel stupid?

01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:28.238
What about us?

01:09:42.698 --> 01:09:43.906
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.863
I'm sorry.

01:09:49.948 --> 01:09:51.113
Andy.

01:09:54.739 --> 01:09:56.906
You didn't have to do that.

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.031
Cut it out!

01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:03.823
Oh, you jerk!

01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:06.489
Okay, that's it!
Joey, go to commercial, now!

01:10:06.573 --> 01:10:08.864
I told you I didn't want to do this, didn't I?

01:10:08.948 --> 01:10:11.656
Kaufman, get off my stage.
Get off my stage, man!

01:10:11.739 --> 01:10:13.364
Get your hands off me.

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:15.239
Don't you touch me! You're a nut!

01:10:15.323 --> 01:10:16.364
Break it up!

01:10:16.448 --> 01:10:17.448
You are a nut!

01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:21.864
Why does Andy do that?

01:10:21.948 --> 01:10:22.698
<i>Jesus, you are a nut! Come on!</i>

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:24.031
Why? Why?

01:10:24.114 --> 01:10:25.489
<i>I started using Suave...</i>

01:10:25.573 --> 01:10:27.156
We've gone to commercial!

01:10:27.364 --> 01:10:28.281
Excuse me!

01:10:28.364 --> 01:10:30.739
You're never gonna work
for ABC again, ever!

01:10:30.823 --> 01:10:31.781
Excuse me?

01:10:31.948 --> 01:10:34.073
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

01:10:34.573 --> 01:10:37.823
You have all just participated
in a happening.

01:10:46.698 --> 01:10:48.739
Now, okay, now...

01:10:48.823 --> 01:10:52.156
...to make it real, some of you down there
knew what was going on...

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:54.364
...and some of you didn't. I'm sorry.

01:10:54.448 --> 01:10:57.323
But we don't want to upset
the folks at home...

01:10:57.406 --> 01:11:02.198
...so now, Andy is going to tell them
that it was all just a prank.

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:06.323
<i>Coming back from commercial, and...</i>

01:11:11.281 --> 01:11:14.114
During the commercials,
the people at ABC...

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:17.989
<i>... told me to explain to you
that this whole fight episode...</i>

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.198
<i>... was staged.</i>

01:11:19.281 --> 01:11:20.614
Oh, good.

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:21.906
<i>It's a lie!</i>

01:11:21.989 --> 01:11:24.114
<i>It's a cover-up! Why are you laughing?</i>

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:27.281
<i>I don't understand why you're laughing.
I'm not being funny.</i>

01:11:27.364 --> 01:11:28.864
<i>What you saw was real!</i>

01:11:29.698 --> 01:11:31.989
<i>These things occur
all the time at the networks...</i>

01:11:32.073 --> 01:11:33.406
<i>... only they're cut away.</i>

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.698
Cut to commercial.

01:11:34.781 --> 01:11:35.698
You see?

01:11:35.781 --> 01:11:36.656
You see?

01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:40.156
<i>Now, for sure they'll fire me.
If you want to see me again...</i>

01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:41.781
<i>... you'll have to come to Memphis...</i>

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.156
NIBLETS CORN
In Butter Sauce

01:11:44.073 --> 01:11:45.448
What's in Memphis?

01:11:45.531 --> 01:11:48.364
<i>The giant's flavor-tight pouch
lets you cook the corn in...</i>

01:11:48.448 --> 01:11:49.364
<i>That kid is totally meshuga.</i>

01:11:57.489 --> 01:12:01.073
<i>Jerry "the King" Lawler!</i>

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:08.739
<i>The most popular athlete...</i>

01:12:08.989 --> 01:12:11.823
<i>... in the history of Memphis, Tennessee...</i>

01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:14.406
<i>... steppin' inside a square circle.</i>

01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:19.656
<i>At 236 pounds...</i>

01:12:22.031 --> 01:12:26.906
<i>... Jerry "the King" Lawler!</i>

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.906
<i>And introducing, at 191 pounds...</i>

01:12:36.739 --> 01:12:38.073
<i>... the holder of...</i>

01:12:38.156 --> 01:12:42.073
<i>... the World Intergender Championship...</i>

01:12:42.531 --> 01:12:46.781
<i>... here is Andy Kaufman!</i>

01:12:47.573 --> 01:12:50.781
<i>You can hear the ovation or lack of one
for Andy Kaufman.</i>

01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:52.948
<i>The cheers turn to jeers.</i>

01:12:54.864 --> 01:12:58.406
<i>Yeah, Lawler is gonna settle the score
for each and every one of us...</i>

01:12:58.489 --> 01:13:02.281
<i>... because we've all been insulted
by this hideous Andy Kaufman.</i>

01:13:02.364 --> 01:13:04.989
<i>This man from Hollywood, California...</i>

01:13:09.989 --> 01:13:14.073
<i>Before we begin this event,
I just want to say a couple of things...</i>

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.406
<i>... to you disgusting people!</i>

01:13:16.573 --> 01:13:17.864
Come on!

01:13:17.989 --> 01:13:20.114
Now, that's just not right.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.573
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

01:13:25.406 --> 01:13:26.614
<i>Okay!</i>

01:13:27.948 --> 01:13:29.948
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:33.698
<i>... this is a bar of soap.</i>

01:13:35.531 --> 01:13:36.906
<i>Say it with me.</i>

01:13:36.989 --> 01:13:38.031
<i>Soap.</i>

01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:42.531
<i>All you have to do is wet this bar of soap...</i>

01:13:42.614 --> 01:13:46.073
<i>... and wipe your hands with it
and rub it on your body...</i>

01:13:46.364 --> 01:13:50.614
<i>... and soon that disgusting, filthy dirt...</i>

01:13:50.698 --> 01:13:51.864
<i>... will come off!</i>

01:13:51.948 --> 01:13:53.823
Why is he saying these things?

01:13:53.906 --> 01:13:57.156
He's just engaging the audience.
He's riling them up.

01:13:57.239 --> 01:13:59.073
They are going to lynch him.

01:13:59.156 --> 01:14:01.239
<i>And now for lesson two.</i>

01:14:02.281 --> 01:14:05.489
<i>This is toilet paper!</i>

01:14:05.573 --> 01:14:07.406
<i>- Good grief.
- Use it!</i>

01:14:09.281 --> 01:14:12.781
<i>Let me tell you something, Kaufman.
We've had enough of your crap.</i>

01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:16.614
<i>Now, let's do what we came here to do,
let's wrestle, right now!</i>

01:14:16.698 --> 01:14:20.031
<i>All right, here we go.
The King is ready, and I hope...</i>

01:14:20.114 --> 01:14:22.614
<i>... for Kaufman's sake, he's ready.</i>

01:14:28.656 --> 01:14:31.323
<i>Kaufman's due a trip
to the old woodshed here.</i>

01:14:34.156 --> 01:14:37.114
<i>I never thought I'd see the day that...</i>

01:14:37.281 --> 01:14:39.198
<i>Well, look at Kaufman!</i>

01:14:39.864 --> 01:14:42.656
<i>Yeah, Kaufman doesn't want
any part of Lawler.</i>

01:14:42.739 --> 01:14:45.281
<i>He's an absolute embarrassment
to humanity...</i>

01:14:45.364 --> 01:14:46.989
<i>... this man from Hollywood.</i>

01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:49.948
<i>You see, I am from Hollywood.</i>

01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:52.281
<i>- Who cares?
- I have the brains.</i>

01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:54.781
<i>Nobody cares where you're from!</i>

01:14:55.239 --> 01:14:59.073
<i>"I'm the King. I'm the King.
I'm the King of Memphis, Tennessee. "</i>

01:14:59.156 --> 01:15:01.323
Andy, please, let's go home.

01:15:01.406 --> 01:15:04.156
<i>Don't worry, Mom, I'll make you proud.</i>

01:15:05.614 --> 01:15:09.364
<i>Kaufman got nailed with somethin'.
Some fan threw somethin'.</i>

01:15:10.323 --> 01:15:11.614
<i>Who did that?</i>

01:15:11.906 --> 01:15:13.573
<i>You cannot touch me!</i>

01:15:13.656 --> 01:15:14.989
<i>- I'll sue you!
- Hey, Kaufman!</i>

01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:16.906
<i>I make more money in one day...</i>

01:15:16.989 --> 01:15:20.406
<i>... than you do
in your entire lives combined.</i>

01:15:21.323 --> 01:15:22.323
Kaufman!

01:15:23.948 --> 01:15:27.448
Did you come down here
to wrestle or act like an ass?

01:15:28.573 --> 01:15:31.573
Now get in the ring!
I'll give you a free headlock, okay?

01:15:31.656 --> 01:15:32.448
Come on!

01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:36.073
<i>Lawler seems to be willing
to offer a free hold here of some kind.</i>

01:15:36.656 --> 01:15:38.823
No, not now, drop it! Drop it, now!

01:15:38.906 --> 01:15:40.364
It'll be okay! Lt's okay.

01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:44.156
<i>Let Kaufman get in there
and let's see what kind of man he is.</i>

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:47.031
One, two, three.

01:15:48.198 --> 01:15:52.031
<i>I can't believe that the King
is gonna go through with this.</i>

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.281
Come on!

01:15:53.489 --> 01:15:56.739
<i>That big-mouth son of a gun
has got a free headlock!</i>

01:15:56.823 --> 01:15:58.698
<i>And business may pick up here!</i>

01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:02.448
I did it! This is for real! I did it! Yeah!

01:16:02.823 --> 01:16:04.573
<i>Look out, Kaufman!</i>

01:16:05.489 --> 01:16:07.781
<i>There he goes! Hold on!</i>

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.323
<i>Kaufman in trouble.</i>

01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:14.323
<i>Look out!</i>

01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:22.239
<i>The King folded him up
like an accordion that time.</i>

01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:27.989
<i>And now the King is asking the crowd
if they want to see the piledriver.</i>

01:16:28.114 --> 01:16:31.698
<i>That's illegal. Kaufman is out of it.</i>

01:16:32.364 --> 01:16:34.239
<i>Oh, my! Oh, my!</i>

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:37.281
<i>It's gonna be a piledriver!</i>

01:16:39.323 --> 01:16:40.781
<i>There it is!</i>

01:16:41.906 --> 01:16:42.781
Andy!

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:48.031
<i>And he's hurt bad. That's an automatic
disqualification, right there.</i>

01:16:49.781 --> 01:16:53.073
<i>Well, Kaufman wins, but he doesn't
look like a winner, right now.</i>

01:16:53.156 --> 01:16:55.448
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

01:17:00.948 --> 01:17:01.906
Hey, George.

01:17:01.989 --> 01:17:04.864
Hey, Lorne. Thanks for seeing me
at such short notice.

01:17:10.823 --> 01:17:14.156
I wanted to talk to you
about putting Andy...

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:16.781
<i>... back on Saturday Night Live.</i>

01:17:20.281 --> 01:17:23.489
George, I don't know whether Andy
works on the show, anymore.

01:17:23.573 --> 01:17:25.823
I mean, the wrestling stuff is...

01:17:26.323 --> 01:17:28.448
- Yeah...
- Just, I think it's worn...

01:17:28.531 --> 01:17:31.864
The wrestling.
Yeah, we all agree completely about...

01:17:32.906 --> 01:17:35.531
...the wrestling, now.
- That's smart.

01:17:37.448 --> 01:17:39.364
Andy is very sincere.

01:17:39.948 --> 01:17:42.489
He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler...

01:17:42.573 --> 01:17:45.156
...and repent for all his bad guy
shenanigans.

01:17:45.239 --> 01:17:48.198
I apologize for all the wrestling
I've ever done...

01:17:48.281 --> 01:17:51.406
...and I'm sorry for all the grief
I've ever given.

01:17:51.906 --> 01:17:56.323
I was just playing bad guy wrestler,
you know, and it's just a role.

01:17:56.531 --> 01:18:00.073
It's not me. So, I guess Jerry just...

01:18:01.281 --> 01:18:02.989
...took it personally.

01:18:03.073 --> 01:18:06.573
I mean, you said some pretty
inflammatory things, obviously.

01:18:06.698 --> 01:18:09.031
Right, I mean,
everything's a joke to this guy.

01:18:09.114 --> 01:18:11.448
Like that thing. Is it a neck brace...

01:18:11.531 --> 01:18:13.531
...or a flea collar?
- That's not true.

01:18:13.614 --> 01:18:16.073
This is very serious. I went to the hospital.

01:18:16.156 --> 01:18:18.823
<i>I was in the hospital for three days,
in traction.</i>

01:18:18.906 --> 01:18:22.198
<i>And I'll tell you something else.
My dad said I could've sued you.</i>

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.656
I could have sued you
for everything you've got.

01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:27.614
But I didn't because I'm not that kinda guy.

01:18:29.531 --> 01:18:31.531
What kinda guy are you?

01:18:43.364 --> 01:18:47.239
Tell you what, I think maybe
I'll get a lawyer, you know?

01:18:48.489 --> 01:18:51.573
Listen, if you were a man,
you'd apologize to me right now.

01:18:51.656 --> 01:18:54.281
But you're just poor, white trash,
and so I guess...

01:18:54.364 --> 01:18:56.489
...that's too lofty a concept for you.

01:18:56.573 --> 01:18:59.364
I mean, you know, what are you gonna do?

01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:09.406
<i>Are we, is everything, are you okay?</i>

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:14.156
I'm sick of this shit, Lawler.

01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:16.781
I'm gonna sue you
for everything you've got...

01:19:16.864 --> 01:19:18.031
...I swear to God.

01:19:18.114 --> 01:19:18.906
Fuck you!

01:19:18.989 --> 01:19:20.656
Okay? Okay, Lawler?

01:19:20.739 --> 01:19:22.656
Fuck you! I'm sorry Dave. Okay?

01:19:22.739 --> 01:19:25.781
<i>I know I'm not supposed to say
those things on television.</i>

01:19:25.864 --> 01:19:29.073
<i>I can't say those words, and I apologize.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</i>

01:19:29.281 --> 01:19:33.198
<i>But you, you are a...
- Ing, ... - Ing, ... - Hole!</i>

01:19:33.281 --> 01:19:34.448
<i>Okay?</i>

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:38.739
Well...

01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:47.448
...I think you can use
some of those words on TV...

01:19:47.531 --> 01:19:49.823
...but, what you can't do is throw coffee.

01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:54.739
<i>"Some of us at Saturday Night Live
think that...</i>

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.781
"...Andy Kaufman's a comic genius,
but others disagree.

01:19:58.239 --> 01:20:00.823

01:20:00.906 --> 01:20:03.781

JOKESTER AND Y KAUFMAN
VOTED OFF SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE

01:20:15.323 --> 01:20:16.573
This is bad.

01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:20.281
I only got 28 percent.

01:20:20.364 --> 01:20:23.823
<i>This is Saturday Night Live,
the hippest audience in television.</i>

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:25.364
They turned on you.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.364
Look, it pains me to say this...

01:20:31.406 --> 01:20:35.656
...but I don't think you two guys
should ever work together again.

01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:39.823
I'm sorry, George,
we just thought it was funny.

01:20:39.906 --> 01:20:43.739
You don't have to be sorry, Jerry.
You're terrific.

01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:46.323
You're just the best.

01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:49.573
I wouldn't have traded it for anything.

01:20:49.656 --> 01:20:52.406
To me, this was a shining moment
for wrestling.

01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:53.489
Me, too.

01:20:53.614 --> 01:20:57.614
And it was a shining moment
for behavioral science.

01:20:59.906 --> 01:21:02.781
But, why can't I make a gag out of this?
I mean...

01:21:02.864 --> 01:21:05.906
...maybe I could go on the show,
and I could...

01:21:05.989 --> 01:21:09.739
...I could say it was rigged
and that I demand a recount.

01:21:12.864 --> 01:21:15.906
Andy, you don't understand.

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.823
They don't want you back.

01:21:27.614 --> 01:21:29.281
Now, close your eyes...

01:21:30.656 --> 01:21:33.448
...and if the thoughts of this world
enter your head...

01:21:33.531 --> 01:21:36.239
...don't be upset by them.
It's just your stress...

01:21:36.323 --> 01:21:40.906
...unraveling itself.
Just slowly come back to the mantra.

01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:41.989
Andy?

01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:47.198
Please.

01:21:48.948 --> 01:21:51.739
Just continue your meditation.
I'll be back.

<i>Jai Gurudev.</i>

01:21:54.448 --> 01:21:55.698
<i>Jai Gurudev.</i>

01:21:56.656 --> 01:21:57.823
Hi, Andy.

01:21:57.906 --> 01:21:58.698
Hi.

01:21:59.531 --> 01:22:00.614
Hi.

01:22:01.489 --> 01:22:05.781
This is very difficult for me to say...

01:22:10.906 --> 01:22:13.448
...but we feel that it's best...

01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:16.114
...if you don't attend the retreat.

01:22:18.573 --> 01:22:19.531
Why?

01:22:21.906 --> 01:22:23.573
I go to the retreat every year.

01:22:23.656 --> 01:22:26.906
I know, Andy,
and we don't doubt your devotion...

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:30.489
...to transcendental meditation.
It's just that we feel that...

01:22:30.573 --> 01:22:34.406
...well, you and the program
have grown apart...

01:22:34.989 --> 01:22:36.573
Philosophically.

01:22:36.656 --> 01:22:38.864
"Philosophically?"
What's "philosophically"?

01:22:38.948 --> 01:22:42.281
Well, Andy, the wrestling,
the sexist remarks, the foul language...

01:22:42.364 --> 01:22:45.906
...they're just not becoming of an individual
of spiritual enlightenment.

01:22:45.989 --> 01:22:49.323
It seems you just don't respect anything.

01:22:50.739 --> 01:22:55.906
Of course I do. It's just I think of the world
as an illusion...

01:22:55.989 --> 01:22:58.864
...and we shouldn't take ourselves
so seriously.

01:22:58.948 --> 01:23:00.198
Don't...

01:23:01.948 --> 01:23:06.239
Don't, please do this.

01:23:06.698 --> 01:23:09.864
You've got to let me attend these classes.

01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.698
It's what keeps me balanced.

01:23:11.781 --> 01:23:14.031
It's apparently not working.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.823
Then help me. Help me, okay? Guide me.

01:23:19.614 --> 01:23:22.364
We just don't wish your presence here.

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:32.073
Hi.

01:23:33.823 --> 01:23:35.823
I brought you some Haagen-Dazs.

01:23:38.156 --> 01:23:40.406
I don't deserve Haagen-Dazs.

01:23:41.781 --> 01:23:42.948
I'm a bad person.

01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:44.239
Don't.

01:23:48.781 --> 01:23:50.864
You aren't a bad person.

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:54.239
You are a complicated person.

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:57.323
You don't know the real me.

01:23:59.323 --> 01:24:01.323
There isn't a real you.

01:24:04.198 --> 01:24:06.239
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:24:12.364 --> 01:24:13.531
Baby.

01:24:17.156 --> 01:24:19.531
Do you want to move in with me?

01:24:21.448 --> 01:24:24.198
What? Say it again.

01:24:29.323 --> 01:24:34.489
"Oh, Rose Marie

01:24:35.989 --> 01:24:38.698
"I love you

01:24:39.239 --> 01:24:45.156
"I'm always dreaming of you"

Hey, George. I'm not sure

01:25:15.698 --> 01:25:18.489
<i>Andy, I got some crummy news.</i>

01:25:21.198 --> 01:25:22.948
<i>Taxi has been canceled.</i>

01:25:23.031 --> 01:25:24.656
Put that stuff over there.

01:25:24.739 --> 01:25:26.448
And the crummy news?

01:25:28.906 --> 01:25:31.614
<i>You want me to come over
and talk about it?</i>

01:25:33.239 --> 01:25:35.448
No. I'm sort of busy, right now.

01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:38.531
I'll see you next week, though. Thanks.

01:25:44.698 --> 01:25:47.448
Yeah, okay. Put it right there. Right there.

01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:04.531
Yuck.

01:26:06.739 --> 01:26:10.073
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a treat for staying late.</i>

01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:13.323
<i>Please welcome from Taxi,
the Improv's own...</i>

01:26:13.406 --> 01:26:15.406
<i>... Mr. Andy Kaufman!</i>

01:26:21.031 --> 01:26:23.073
<i>Actually, Budd, you're wrong.</i>

01:26:23.448 --> 01:26:26.739
<i>I found out today
that Taxi has been canceled.</i>

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:28.614
What?

01:26:29.823 --> 01:26:32.323
<i>Not to mention that my wife left me...</i>

01:26:33.948 --> 01:26:35.864
<i>... and she took the kids.</i>

01:26:38.656 --> 01:26:41.781
<i>I don't understand why you're laughing.
I'm not joking.</i>

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.656
<i>And then this morning...</i>

01:26:44.739 --> 01:26:49.739
<i>... I got up and I noticed
that I have a cyst, or some kind of boil...</i>

01:26:49.906 --> 01:26:52.031
<i>... on the back of my neck.</i>

01:26:53.114 --> 01:26:53.989
<i>Look.</i>

01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:55.656
<i>See?</i>

01:26:55.948 --> 01:26:58.114
<i>So I was thinking that since...</i>

01:26:58.531 --> 01:27:03.156
<i>... I'm still kind of a quasi-celebrity, that...</i>

01:27:03.656 --> 01:27:06.989
<i>... maybe I could charge people to touch it.</i>

01:27:08.948 --> 01:27:12.198
<i>Would anybody like to pay $1
to touch my cyst?</i>

01:27:14.573 --> 01:27:18.073
<i>I'm serious. I could really use
the money, right now.</i>

01:27:18.448 --> 01:27:20.156
<i>It's a good deal.</i>

01:27:24.864 --> 01:27:25.906
<i>Okay.</i>

01:27:26.364 --> 01:27:28.781
<i>Wait, no, you gotta pay first.</i>

01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:34.489
<i>It's $1 to touch my celebrity cyst.</i>

01:27:35.656 --> 01:27:36.573
<i>Okay.</i>

01:27:58.781 --> 01:27:59.906
Thank you.

01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:01.531
Thank you very much.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:10.656
Would Andy like to tell us
why he called us out...

01:28:10.739 --> 01:28:12.864
...at 4:00 in the morning?

01:28:16.156 --> 01:28:17.156
Yeah.

01:28:19.031 --> 01:28:20.323
I have cancer.

01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:26.739
Forget it. Forget it!

01:28:26.906 --> 01:28:29.281
That is in terrible taste.

01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:32.364
I don't want to have anything
to do with this.

01:28:32.448 --> 01:28:36.489
No, no, no, that's good.
Yeah, we can make that play.

01:28:38.031 --> 01:28:42.198
Yeah, okay. And we'll just, we'll really,
we'll just drag it out.

01:28:42.531 --> 01:28:45.281
All right? You get better, you get worse...

01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:50.406
No, you die!
And then, you come back to life.

01:28:51.781 --> 01:28:53.489
That's funny.

01:28:54.114 --> 01:28:57.989
That's funny, but, it's not a gag, Bob.

01:28:58.073 --> 01:29:00.614
I got cancer. I got lung cancer.

01:29:01.739 --> 01:29:05.906
Lung cancer? That's ridiculous,
you don't even smoke.

01:29:06.656 --> 01:29:10.989
I've got some freaky, rare kind.
It's called large cell carcinoma.

01:29:13.573 --> 01:29:15.073
I'm a lucky guy.

01:29:28.448 --> 01:29:30.364
Have you told your family?

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:33.281
No. I don't want to tell them.

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:39.406
I just...

01:29:44.239 --> 01:29:46.281
I've jerked 'em around so much.

01:29:50.948 --> 01:29:55.614
Andy, look in my eye,
and tell me this is true.

01:29:57.614 --> 01:29:59.156
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:59.989 --> 01:30:01.573
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:30:02.364 --> 01:30:03.573
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.489 --> 01:30:06.948
Lynne! Come on.

01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:14.989
If I find out that you're behind this,
I'll kill you, Zmuda!

01:30:15.114 --> 01:30:19.406
What the hell are you talkin' about George?
I was the one who didn't believe him.

01:30:19.864 --> 01:30:22.781
That's the kinda thing that you two
would work out to fuck me up!

01:30:23.198 --> 01:30:25.323
<i>We want the truth, boy. The truth!</i>

01:30:25.489 --> 01:30:28.364
<i>My father said Lassie bit me,
so, I said she did, too.</i>

01:30:28.448 --> 01:30:30.823
<i>Lassie never bit you, and you know it.</i>

01:30:30.906 --> 01:30:32.239
<i>Case dismissed!</i>

01:30:55.073 --> 01:30:55.614
Dad?

01:30:57.114 --> 01:31:00.948
The cancer started here in Andy's lungs
and spread to his left arm.

01:31:01.698 --> 01:31:04.864
We've initiated
an aggressive radiation program.

01:31:04.948 --> 01:31:07.573
See if we can eradicate the affected cells.

01:31:07.656 --> 01:31:10.406
<i>- Dr. Sullivan, line one.
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.</i>

01:31:16.448 --> 01:31:17.698
What a crock.

01:31:20.698 --> 01:31:23.114
How dare you make light of this?

01:31:23.281 --> 01:31:26.406
Dad, I cried when he broke his neck.
He's not getting me again.

01:31:26.489 --> 01:31:28.989
Jesus Christ, Carol, he's got lung cancer.

01:31:29.073 --> 01:31:32.906
He wants us scratching our heads,
asking ourselves, "Is this real?"

01:31:33.698 --> 01:31:35.198
Of course it's real.

01:31:35.406 --> 01:31:36.823
We're in a hospital.

01:31:36.906 --> 01:31:39.364
Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai.

01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:42.073
It's a show biz hospital.

01:31:42.323 --> 01:31:44.823
Andy's studio friends
probably run this place.

01:31:44.906 --> 01:31:48.198
He plans these things.
He takes over and hires actors.

01:31:49.073 --> 01:31:52.323
Personally, I didn't think that doctor guy
was very convincing.

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:55.948
- Did you notice he had the wrong shoes?
- He didn't have doctor shoes.

01:31:56.031 --> 01:31:57.864
NATIONAL
ENQUIRER

01:31:57.948 --> 01:31:59.364
No, that's bullshit!

01:31:59.448 --> 01:32:02.281
No more Kaufman stories.
He's burned us too many times.

01:32:02.364 --> 01:32:05.864
A very reliable source told me,
Andy Kaufman has lung cancer.

01:32:06.031 --> 01:32:08.406
Please, he's definitely not dying.

01:32:09.031 --> 01:32:14.073
Now those big white cells
are attacking the cancer cells.

01:32:15.031 --> 01:32:18.531
Attacking. Attacking.

01:32:18.906 --> 01:32:21.864
- I see them. I see the white cells.
- Attacking.

01:32:22.656 --> 01:32:23.823
Attacking.

01:32:24.364 --> 01:32:26.281
- Attacking.
- Attacking.

01:32:40.573 --> 01:32:42.114
He's an actor.

01:32:43.114 --> 01:32:45.698
<i>I recognize him from The In-Laws!</i>

01:32:47.656 --> 01:32:52.073
That's true. But he's also ordained
in holistic medicine.

01:32:57.823 --> 01:32:59.239
What am I supposed to do?

01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:03.656
I'm sick and I'm tryin' to get better,
but everybody's lookin' at me funny.

01:33:04.406 --> 01:33:07.489
I feel like I'm being surrounded
by negative energy.

01:33:14.573 --> 01:33:17.281
You're surrounded by what you create.

01:33:17.489 --> 01:33:18.406
Oh, great.

01:33:18.489 --> 01:33:21.823
- Andy, you're the king of negative energy.
- It's gotta stop.

01:33:22.698 --> 01:33:23.573
Andy.

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:28.531
'Cause if these negative vibes get out,
then everyone'll talk about how sick I am.

01:33:28.614 --> 01:33:31.156
And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:33.573
How can I help you?

01:33:38.864 --> 01:33:41.989
- I want to go back to work.
- You want to tour the clubs?

01:33:42.073 --> 01:33:45.739
No, no clubs. I want to reach the top.

01:33:48.573 --> 01:33:49.989
Carnegie Hall!

01:33:51.073 --> 01:33:53.864
I just want this show to build and build!

01:33:53.948 --> 01:33:58.073
I want it to be everything that's joyful,
just pile one thing on top of the other...

01:33:58.156 --> 01:34:01.448
...until the audience just turn into children
right in front of me.

01:34:01.573 --> 01:34:04.531
- It might even have Santa Claus.
- Oh, yeah.

01:34:04.864 --> 01:34:08.364
And you can say, "Santa, what am I gettin'
for Christmas this year?"

01:34:08.448 --> 01:34:10.364
And he says, "Cancer".

01:34:10.948 --> 01:34:12.406
No, not that.

01:34:12.489 --> 01:34:15.156
I don't want to do that. That's a bummer.

01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:17.698
Okay, positive.

01:34:17.864 --> 01:34:21.573
This is really, great. Santa, snow...

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.406
But it's going to cost a fortune.

01:34:24.656 --> 01:34:26.656
That's okay. Not a problem.

01:34:27.614 --> 01:34:30.531
- Well, who's gonna pay for it, Andy?
- Tony Clifton?

01:34:33.989 --> 01:34:36.948
Andy, Tony doesn't have
that kind of money.

01:34:37.073 --> 01:34:40.906
Don't you worry about that, George.
I know Tony a lot better than you do.

01:34:40.989 --> 01:34:45.489
And even if he has to work for another
ten years to pay it off, he'll do it.

<i>Thank you, Andy. I'm delighted to be here.
It's really overwhelming to me.</i>

01:36:32.239 --> 01:36:35.656

because we found...</i>

01:36:39.156 --> 01:36:43.489

How about me and you dolls
go out and get some real food?

01:41:37.364 --> 01:41:38.281
All right.

01:41:38.364 --> 01:41:41.073
French fries and a porterhouse steak!

<i>Or we can skip the meal and go right
to the montage a' trois!</i>

01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:54.031
Have you ever been with another woman?

01:41:55.614 --> 01:41:57.989
Well, like in the kitchen and stuff, yeah.

01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:00.614
This'll help.

01:42:03.239 --> 01:42:04.073
Okay.

01:42:04.156 --> 01:42:06.323
- Here, put that on your face.
- Okay.

- There you go!
- Hi.

01:42:09.114 --> 01:42:11.281
Now, you can't even tell the difference!

01:42:15.156 --> 01:42:18.073
Well, we could put all of this together,
in a soup...

01:42:18.156 --> 01:42:20.823
...and we could pretend
it's a porterhouse steak, Andy.

01:42:21.198 --> 01:42:24.364
I am not Andy. Andy is sick.

01:42:25.531 --> 01:42:27.198

...for a TV show.

01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:25.656
It would be a Saturday morning
kind of thing...

01:43:26.073 --> 01:43:28.031
...where I can goof off with the kids.

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:34.114
We can sell that, Andy.

01:43:35.656 --> 01:43:38.948
Did your doctor say it's okay
to go back to work?

01:43:39.948 --> 01:43:42.323
No, but he will.

01:43:46.864 --> 01:43:49.489
'Cause I'm goin' to the Philippines.

01:43:51.114 --> 01:43:54.448
The Philippines? What's in the Philippines?

01:43:58.031 --> 01:43:59.406
