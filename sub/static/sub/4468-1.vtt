00:33.575 --> 00:35.176
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.870
I can break through
walls, I just can't...

00:37.955 --> 00:40.039
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

00:40.124 --> 00:43.459
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

00:43.544 --> 00:47.463
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.758
Who wants the pressure of
being super all the time?

00:52.803 --> 00:54.887
Of course I have a
secret identity.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.641
Can you see me in this at
the supermarket? Come on.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.006
Who'd want to go shopping as
Elastigirl, know what I mean?

01:03.063 --> 01:06.858
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

01:06.942 --> 01:10.069
Think it'll strengthen the
relationship or something.

01:10.154 --> 01:15.491
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

01:15.576 --> 01:20.121
I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

01:20.205 --> 01:24.125
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.252
No matter how many times
you save the world,

01:26.336 --> 01:30.006
it always manages to get
back in jeopardy again.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.551
Sometimes I just want it
to stay saved, you know?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.971
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess."

01:37.055 --> 01:39.640
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

01:39.725 --> 01:41.434
I could
get to that point.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.437
- "Please?"
We're not finished.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.857
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.359
Relax a little and
raise a family.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.613
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

01:53.697 --> 01:56.407
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.869
Leave the saving of the world to the men?
I don't think so.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.246
I don't think so.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.974
We interrupt
for a bulletin.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.144
A high-speed pursuit between police
and armed gunmen is underway,

02:25.228 --> 02:27.647
traveling northbound
on San Pablo Ave.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.237
Yeah, I've got time.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.807
Mr. Incredible.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.564
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.529
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.989
No, he's quite tame.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.045
Let go now.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.272
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.441
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.901
All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...

03:55.986 --> 03:58.446
Tour bus robbery.
I've still got time.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.781
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.868
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...

04:03.952 --> 04:06.537
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.205
What? No.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.499
You're that kid
from the fan club.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.252
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

04:13.336 --> 04:15.171
My name is IncrediBoy.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.339
I've been nice, I've
stood for photos,

04:17.423 --> 04:20.009
signed every scrap of
paper you pushed at me...

04:20.093 --> 04:22.720
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

04:22.804 --> 04:25.765
crime fighting style, favorite
catch phrases, everything!

04:25.849 --> 04:27.558
I'm your number one fan!

04:30.854 --> 04:32.605
Hey! Hey, wait!

04:41.865 --> 04:42.948
You know,

04:43.033 --> 04:47.036
you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

04:47.120 --> 04:50.081
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.165
Hey, look...

04:56.797 --> 04:58.047
Elastigirl.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.216
Mr. Incredible.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.761
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.930
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.724
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.685
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.938
Thanks, but I don't
need any help.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.981
Whatever happened
to "ladies first"?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.275
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.945
Look, the lady got me first.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.198
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.784
Well, I think you
need to be more

05:27.786 --> 05:28.911
flexible.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.330
Are you doing anything later?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.791
I have a previous engagement.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.179
Now, you just stay here.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.224
They usually pick up the
garbage in an hour.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.935
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

05:53.019 --> 05:56.438
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.025
He's gonna jump!

06:14.332 --> 06:16.250
I think you
broke something.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.461
With counseling, I think
you'll come to forgive me.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.338
Wait a minute.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.995
Bomb Voyage.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.997
Mr. Incredible...!

06:55.123 --> 06:57.541
And IncrediBoy!

06:57.709 --> 06:59.251
IncrediBoy?

07:00.337 --> 07:04.131
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.799
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

07:05.884 --> 07:06.967
Little oaf...!

07:07.177 --> 07:08.427
Can we talk?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.638
You always say be
true to yourself,

07:10.722 --> 07:13.557
but you never say which
part to be true to.

07:13.642 --> 07:18.437
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward. IncrediBoy!

07:18.521 --> 07:21.565
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.859
This is because I don't
have powers, isn't it?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.028
Not every superhero
has powers, you know.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.905
You can be super without them.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.450
I invented these. I can fly.
Can you fly?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.786
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.579
And your outfit is
totally ridiculous!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.958
Just give me one chance! I'll show you.
I'll go get the police.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.293
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.712
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.925
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.886
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...

07:51.012 --> 07:54.181
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

08:38.101 --> 08:42.104
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.063
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

08:44.149 --> 08:46.233
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.317
They picked him up.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.820
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

08:49.904 --> 08:51.447
who I caught robbing the vault.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.074
We might nab him if we
set up a perimeter.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.118
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.454
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.082
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.376
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.921
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

09:08.006 --> 09:12.134
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

09:18.641 --> 09:20.851
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.313
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.317
Showtime.

09:32.197 --> 09:36.116
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

09:36.201 --> 09:39.286
You're late. When you asked if
I was doing anything later,

09:39.370 --> 09:42.706
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.167
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.753
You need to be more flexible.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.255
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

09:50.340 --> 09:52.508
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.635
You know that. Don't you?

09:54.719 --> 09:57.221
So long as you both shall live?
I do.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.182
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.480
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.734
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

10:13.363 --> 10:16.824
In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

10:16.908 --> 10:20.327
for saving someone who, apparently,
didn't want to be saved.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.079
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

10:22.163 --> 10:25.624
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

10:25.708 --> 10:29.711
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.132
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.218
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

10:36.302 --> 10:38.637
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

10:38.721 --> 10:40.973
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.766
My client
has no comment.

10:42.851 --> 10:47.479
Another suit was filed by
victims of the El train accident.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.649
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

10:50.733 --> 10:55.112
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

10:55.196 --> 11:00.159
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.245
Time for them to
join us, or go away.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.248
Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

11:06.332 --> 11:08.792
of an ever mounting
series of lawsuits,

11:08.877 --> 11:12.921
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.466
The supers were granted amnesty from
responsibility for past actions,

11:16.551 --> 11:20.888
in exchange for the promise to
never again resume hero work.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.681
Where are they now?

11:22.765 --> 11:27.019
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

11:27.103 --> 11:32.441
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.403
Denied?
You're denying my claim?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.032
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.284
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

11:42.368 --> 11:44.288
but our liability is spelled
out in paragraph 17.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.748
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.625
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.294
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.671
We're now officially moved in.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.548
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.967
The last three years
don't count because...

11:59.052 --> 12:03.096
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.598
Why do we
have so much junk?

12:04.682 --> 12:06.183
Listen, I've got a client.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.353
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.730
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.733
Bye, honey. Excuse me.
Where were we?

12:14.817 --> 12:19.363
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

12:19.447 --> 12:21.490
I don't know what I'll do.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.584
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.296
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

12:36.381 --> 12:39.341
Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.677
On the third floor. But I can't.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.806
I also do not advise you to
fill out and file a WS2475 form

12:45.890 --> 12:47.849
with our legal department
on the second floor.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.186
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.605
I'd like to help, but
there's nothing I can do.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.982
Oh, thank you, young man.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.818
Sorry.
I know you're upset!

12:57.902 --> 12:59.444
Pretend
to be upset.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.367
Parr!

13:05.702 --> 13:07.869
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

13:07.954 --> 13:10.038
Someone broke into
their house, Mr. Huph.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.208
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.129
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.423
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

13:19.507 --> 13:23.885
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.057
Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.647
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.068
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

13:40.153 --> 13:44.323
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.783
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

13:46.868 --> 13:49.911
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.789
Well... Not really. No.

13:52.874 --> 13:53.999
Actually, not.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.126
Oh, then how do you
know it was him?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.754
I hid a camera. Yeah, and
this time, I've got him.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.637
See? You see?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.348
You don't see it?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.935
He moves!
Right there!

14:14.562 --> 14:17.439
Wait, wait! Right there!

14:17.523 --> 14:19.149
Right as I'm sitting down!

14:19.233 --> 14:20.942
I don't know how he does it,

14:21.027 --> 14:23.278
but there's no tack
before he moves

14:23.363 --> 14:27.491
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

14:30.745 --> 14:33.413
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.624
This
little rat is guilty!

14:36.125 --> 14:40.128
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.173
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

14:43.257 --> 14:46.885
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

14:50.556 --> 14:55.394
Dash, this is the third time this
year you've been sent to the office.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.981
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.901
Maybe I could, if you'd
let me go out for sports.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.112
Honey, you know why
we can't do that.

15:05.196 --> 15:09.741
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.701
Dashiell Robert Parr,

15:11.786 --> 15:15.288
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.499
The last thing you
need is temptation.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.961
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.255
Why can't I do the
best that I can do?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.966
Right now, honey, the world
just wants us to fit in,

15:26.050 --> 15:28.593
and to fit in, we just gotta
be like everybody else.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.596
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.267
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.978
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.031
Rydinger, where you headed?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.619
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.457
- "Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
- That's kind of funny.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.251
"Hey, Tony, do you
play football?"

16:04.046 --> 16:06.423
Tony, I thought we
were gonna go swimming.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.801
He looked at me.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.722
Come on, Violet!

16:37.246 --> 16:40.207
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.627
Oh, great.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.540
Mom.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.461
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.964
You make weird faces, honey.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.467
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.554
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

17:35.638 --> 17:38.765
Bob, could you help the
carnivore cut his meat?

17:39.767 --> 17:44.104
Dash, you have something you wanna
tell your father about school?

17:44.188 --> 17:46.273
Well, we
dissected a frog.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.983
Dash got sent to
the office again.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.610
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.863
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.657
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.451
He put a tack on the teacher's
chair, during class.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.580
Nobody saw me. You could
barely see it on the tape.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.874
They caught you on tape and you
still got away with it? Whoa!

18:04.959 --> 18:07.419
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

18:07.503 --> 18:08.878
We are not encouraging this.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.214
I'm not, I'm just
asking how fast...

18:11.299 --> 18:13.008
Honey!

18:15.344 --> 18:18.263
Great. First the car, now I
gotta pay to fix the table...

18:18.347 --> 18:20.056
What happened to the car?

18:21.309 --> 18:24.102
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.272
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

18:27.356 --> 18:30.191
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.903
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.948
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.743
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.787
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.540
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.877
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.589
She'd eat if we were
having Tony loaf.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.382
That's it!

18:54.467 --> 18:55.675
Stop it!

18:56.844 --> 19:00.221
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.223
Sit down!

19:03.142 --> 19:05.810
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.480
You sit down! You sit down!

19:08.564 --> 19:09.939
Violet!

19:16.822 --> 19:17.822
"Simon J. Paladino,

19:18.949 --> 19:22.744
"longtime advocate of superhero
rights, is missing"?

19:23.621 --> 19:27.540
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.001
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

19:30.086 --> 19:33.046
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.964
Okay. I'm intervening!

19:36.425 --> 19:38.677
Violet, let go of your brother.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.595
Hello?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.223
Get the door.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.102
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.049
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.816
Lucius!

19:52.900 --> 19:53.942
Whoa!

19:57.405 --> 19:58.530
Ha, ha. DASH: Oh!

19:58.614 --> 20:01.241
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.868
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.205
Bowling night. Say hello
to Honey for me, Lucius.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.999
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.215
Don't think you've avoided talking
about the principal's office.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.384
Your father and I are
still gonna discuss it.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.220
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.222
Other kids don't
have superpowers.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.351
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

20:28.436 --> 20:30.812
What does anyone in this
family know about normal?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.691
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.611
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.906
Lucky.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.492
I meant about being normal.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.913
So now I'm
in deep trouble.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.250
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.795
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.423
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.469
He starts this prepared speech about
how feeble I am compared to him.

21:02.553 --> 21:06.848
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.183
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.603
I mean, the guy has me on
a platter, and he won't shut up.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.938
Municiberg,
we have a 23-56...

21:14.023 --> 21:15.565
23-56, what is that?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.609
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.819
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.197
Tell you the truth, I'd
rather go bowling.

21:22.281 --> 21:26.784
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.411
Just to shake things up.

21:28.787 --> 21:33.124
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.585
They're just talking.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.796
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.132
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

21:41.217 --> 21:44.802
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

21:44.887 --> 21:48.306
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.643
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

21:51.727 --> 21:55.313
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.607
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.485
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

22:00.569 --> 22:03.988
- We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

22:04.073 --> 22:06.741
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.163
Fire! Yeah!

22:20.256 --> 22:22.423
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.262
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

22:27.346 --> 22:30.598
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

22:30.683 --> 22:32.809
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.186
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.689
You can't run out. You can
use water in the air.

22:37.773 --> 22:41.526
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.529
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.782
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

22:50.536 --> 22:54.163
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

23:07.052 --> 23:08.177
Yeah.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.308
Uh-oh.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.976
Oh, good.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.646
That ain't right.

23:20.983 --> 23:24.485
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.570
Freeze!

23:32.077 --> 23:34.912
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

23:34.997 --> 23:37.832
I'm just getting a drink.

23:41.754 --> 23:46.841
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.429
Police officers!

24:03.567 --> 24:05.276
That was way too close.

24:05.361 --> 24:08.071
We are not doing that again.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.618
Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

24:13.702 --> 24:17.205
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.567
- I thought you'd be back by 11:00.
- I said I'd be back later.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.320
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all,

24:49.405 --> 24:53.408
- you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

25:00.165 --> 25:02.083
Is this rubble?

25:02.167 --> 25:05.586
It was just a
little workout. Just to stay loose.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.340
You know how I feel about that. Darn you!
We can't blow cover again.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.217
The building was
coming down anyway.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.510
What?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.178
You knocked down a building?

25:14.263 --> 25:17.306
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.767
Have you been listening to
the police scanner again?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.895
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.397
It is a bad thing, Bob!

25:24.481 --> 25:28.651
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.612
It's better than acting
like they didn't happen!

25:31.697 --> 25:34.532
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

25:34.616 --> 25:38.077
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

25:38.162 --> 25:41.330
I can't believe you don't want to
go to your own son's graduation.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.417
It's not a graduation. He's moving
from fourth to fifth grade.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.586
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

25:46.670 --> 25:49.422
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

25:49.506 --> 25:51.424
but if someone is exceptional...

25:51.508 --> 25:53.760
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.721
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.599
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

25:59.683 --> 26:02.185
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.437
This is not about you!

26:07.065 --> 26:10.067
All right, Dash. I know you're listening.
Come on out.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.403
Vi?
You, too, young lady.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.864
Come on. Come on out.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.242
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.077
Pretty loud discussion.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.790
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

26:23.874 --> 26:29.754
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

26:29.838 --> 26:32.381
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.134
Everything's okay. Go back to bed.
It's late.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.969
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.515
In fact, we should
all be in bed.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.324
Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

26:58.742 --> 27:00.618
Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

27:00.702 --> 27:03.663
Mr. Huph would like to
talk to you in his office.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.873
- Now?
- Now.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.643
Sit down, Bob.

27:30.858 --> 27:35.361
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.990
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.867
Why what?
Be specific, Bob.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.618
Why are you unhappy?

27:42.703 --> 27:44.495
Your customers make me unhappy.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.330
What, you've gotten complaints?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.874
Complaints I can handle.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.586
What I can't handle is your
customers' inexplicable knowledge

27:51.670 --> 27:55.631
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

27:55.716 --> 27:58.718
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

27:58.802 --> 28:01.345
They're penetrating
the bureaucracy!

28:01.430 --> 28:04.181
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

28:04.266 --> 28:08.519
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.939
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

28:12.024 --> 28:13.858
Starting with our stockholders.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.360
Who's helping them out, huh?

28:18.447 --> 28:22.783
You know,
Bob, a company...

28:22.868 --> 28:24.118
Is like an enormous clock.

28:24.202 --> 28:28.205
Is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

28:28.290 --> 28:33.544
It only works if all the
little cogs mesh together.

28:33.629 --> 28:38.841
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

28:38.926 --> 28:43.930
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.182
I'm being
metaphorical, Bob.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.768
Know what I mean by
cooperative cogs?

28:49.311 --> 28:50.561
Bob?

28:50.646 --> 28:53.981
Bob? Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Parr.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.068
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.237
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

29:00.322 --> 29:02.865
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.494
Stop right now or you're fired!

29:08.997 --> 29:11.165
Close the door.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.252
Get over here, now.

29:18.966 --> 29:22.551
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

29:23.637 --> 29:27.264
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.976
You were this close
to losing your...

29:39.194 --> 29:40.361
Uh-oh.

29:42.072 --> 29:45.700
Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

29:52.666 --> 29:53.874
- How is he?
- He'll live.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.793
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

29:55.877 --> 29:58.045
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.423
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.342
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

30:03.427 --> 30:05.636
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.055
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.641
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.811
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.564
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.651
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

30:20.736 --> 30:24.071
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

30:27.284 --> 30:31.620
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate
you, you know, for old times' sake.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.999
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.334
I'll make it work. Thanks.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.420
Take care of yourself.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.809
What are you waiting for?

30:53.894 --> 30:57.938
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.357
Me, too, kid.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.132
Huh?

31:38.021 --> 31:39.396
"Hold still"?

31:39.481 --> 31:41.857
Match, Mr. Incredible.

31:48.115 --> 31:51.283
Room is secure.
Commence message.

31:51.368 --> 31:55.746
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.749
Rest assured, your
secret is safe with us.

31:58.834 --> 32:02.336
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

32:02.420 --> 32:06.090
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

32:06.174 --> 32:10.678
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.222
I represent a top secret
division of the government,

32:13.306 --> 32:15.474
designing and testing
experimental technology,

32:15.559 --> 32:18.811
and we have need of
your unique abilities.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.105
Something happened at
our testing facility.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.690
- Honey!
- Huh? What?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.525
- Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.153
It is contained within
an isolated area,

32:27.237 --> 32:31.574
it threatens to 'cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

32:31.658 --> 32:34.410
jeopardizing hundreds of
millions of dollars...

32:34.494 --> 32:36.078
Is someone in there?

32:36.163 --> 32:39.415
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

32:39.499 --> 32:42.793
- Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

32:42.878 --> 32:46.797
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

32:46.882 --> 32:50.718
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.680
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.684
You can still do great things.
Or

32:58.768 --> 33:01.937
you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.981
You have 24 hours to respond.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.691
Think about it.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.689
This message
will self-destruct.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.815
Uh-oh.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.544
You are one distracted guy.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.463
Am I?
I don't mean to be.

34:09.547 --> 34:15.261
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

34:15.344 --> 34:20.056
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.726
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

34:22.811 --> 34:25.062
- Something's happened.
- What?

34:25.146 --> 34:26.772
- The, uh...
- What?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.483
The company is sending
me to, uh, a conference.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.735
- A conference?
- Out of town.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.320
I'm gonna be gone
for a few days.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.949
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.076
Yes.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.288
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.914
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.126
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.420
Hello?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.505
This is Mr. Incredible.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.341
I'm in.

35:00.515 --> 35:04.727
The Omnidroid 9000 is a top
secret prototype battle robot.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.230
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

35:08.315 --> 35:11.191
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

35:11.276 --> 35:14.820
Let me guess. It got smart enough to
wonder why it had to take orders.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.991
We lost control. Now it's loose in the
jungle, threatening our facility.

35:19.075 --> 35:22.244
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.329
How am I going in?

35:23.413 --> 35:27.291
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5,000 feet.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.794
Its cloaking devices make
it difficult to track.

35:30.879 --> 35:34.006
We're pretty sure it's on the
Southern half of the island.

35:34.090 --> 35:38.052
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.512
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.140
You are Mr. Incredible.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.828
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.665
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.918
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.505
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.245
Showtime.

37:31.291 --> 37:32.332
Huh?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.878
Hmm.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.352
Uh-oh.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.624
Oh, my back!

39:16.854 --> 39:18.188
Oh!

40:03.651 --> 40:06.862
Surprising. We must
bring him back.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.782
Sound the all clear, and
invite him to dinner.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.429
Most
important, keep things light.

40:32.513 --> 40:36.433
Praise him. Make him feel like
we appreciate his abilities.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.061
Am I overdressed?

40:39.145 --> 40:41.730
Actually, you look
rather dashing.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.858
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.111
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.990
Of course. I do usually make it a
point to know who I'm working for.

40:52.075 --> 40:55.077
He prefers a certain
amount of anonymity.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.496
Surely, you of all
people understand that.

40:57.580 --> 41:02.250
I was just wondering, of all the
places to settle down, why live...

41:02.335 --> 41:06.630
With a volcano?
He's attracted to power. So am I.

41:06.714 --> 41:10.509
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.804
I prefer to think of
it as misunderstood.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.472
Aren't we all?

41:15.556 --> 41:18.266
Volcanic soil is among the
most fertile on Earth.

41:18.351 --> 41:21.478
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

41:21.562 --> 41:25.816
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.901
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.320
Or you'll be late for work.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.782
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.743
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.870
All that jazz.

43:09.796 --> 43:10.879
You have an appointment?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.798
I'm an old friend.
I just wanted to...

43:12.882 --> 43:16.802
- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.929
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

43:20.765 --> 43:24.226
My God, you've gotten fat.
Come in. Come, come.

43:31.818 --> 43:36.238
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

43:36.322 --> 43:40.617
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

43:40.701 --> 43:43.495
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

43:43.579 --> 43:45.914
Milan, darling. Milan.

43:45.998 --> 43:49.960
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.212
Spoiled, stupid,
little stick figures

43:52.296 --> 43:54.840
with poofy lips who think
only about themselves.

43:54.924 --> 43:58.844
Feh!
I used to design for gods.

43:59.637 --> 44:05.016
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh?
I was surprised to get your call.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.435
E, I just need a patch job.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.814
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

44:10.898 --> 44:15.443
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

44:15.528 --> 44:18.113
Moonlighting hero work?

44:18.197 --> 44:20.031
Must have happened
a long time ago.

44:20.116 --> 44:23.159
I see. This is a
hobo suit, darling.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.745
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

44:25.830 --> 44:30.000
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

44:30.084 --> 44:33.211
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.922
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.508
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

44:38.593 --> 44:41.011
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.305
So ask me now, before
I again become sane.

44:43.389 --> 44:46.266
Wait. You want to
make me a suit?

44:46.350 --> 44:49.686
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

44:50.438 --> 44:52.856
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.149
Heroic!

44:54.233 --> 44:57.861
Yeah, something
classic, like Dynaguy!

44:57.945 --> 45:01.615
Oh! He had a great look! Oh,
the cape and the boots...

45:01.699 --> 45:02.741
No capes!

45:03.910 --> 45:07.913
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

45:07.997 --> 45:10.749
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

45:10.833 --> 45:14.127
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.672
All was well,
another day saved

45:17.757 --> 45:20.550
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.969
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

45:23.054 --> 45:24.054
Stratogale!

45:24.138 --> 45:29.434
April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.811
You can't generalize
about these things.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.190
Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

45:35.274 --> 45:39.069
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

45:39.153 --> 45:42.572
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

45:42.657 --> 45:44.699
You know I'm retired
from hero work.

45:44.784 --> 45:48.036
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

45:48.120 --> 45:52.499
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

45:53.334 --> 45:56.670
Fine. I will
also fix the hobo suit.

45:57.421 --> 46:01.341
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.648
Don't answer it,
honey, I got it!

46:16.732 --> 46:19.484
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

46:23.669 --> 46:26.509
- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.284
- See you there.
- Goodbye.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.790
Who was that, honey?
The, uh, office?

46:33.874 --> 46:36.793
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

46:36.877 --> 46:38.712
duty calls.

46:46.595 --> 46:48.555
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

46:50.474 --> 46:53.143
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.812
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

46:55.896 --> 47:00.066
- So much.
- I love you, too.

47:13.205 --> 47:15.165
This is
your automated Captain.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.418
Would you care for more mimosa?

47:18.502 --> 47:21.671
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

47:23.299 --> 47:27.969
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

47:33.934 --> 47:37.687
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.715
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.091
Thanks.

48:07.176 --> 48:09.928
Nice to be back, Mirage.

48:35.788 --> 48:39.457
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

48:39.542 --> 48:42.961
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.546
See you there.

49:17.371 --> 49:18.496
Edna.

49:18.956 --> 49:21.457
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- This is Edna.

49:21.542 --> 49:24.252
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

49:24.336 --> 49:27.589
Helen Parr?
You know...

49:28.841 --> 49:29.841
Elastigirl?

49:29.884 --> 49:34.137
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

49:34.221 --> 49:35.972
It's been a while.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.576
There's only one
person Bob would trust

49:37.600 --> 49:39.309
to patch his supersuit.
That's you.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.352
Yes, yes, yes.
Marvelous, isn't it?

49:41.437 --> 49:44.606
Much better than those horrible
pajamas he used to wear.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.191
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

49:47.276 --> 49:49.360
- I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.945
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

49:51.363 --> 49:53.656
No, I'm calling about suit.

49:53.741 --> 49:56.492
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

49:56.577 --> 50:00.371
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

50:13.802 --> 50:14.886
Hmm.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.112
It's bigger!

50:35.074 --> 50:36.491
It's badder!

50:37.785 --> 50:43.081
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
too much for Mr. Incredible!

50:45.084 --> 50:46.876
It's finally ready.

50:46.961 --> 50:51.339
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

50:51.423 --> 50:54.884
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

50:54.969 --> 50:58.972
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.141
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

51:02.226 --> 51:06.396
I mean, after all, I
am your biggest fan.

51:07.856 --> 51:10.984
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

51:11.610 --> 51:13.820
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

51:13.904 --> 51:17.365
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

51:17.449 --> 51:20.702
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

51:20.995 --> 51:23.454
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

51:23.539 --> 51:27.291
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

51:27.376 --> 51:29.335
You can't count on anyone.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.337
Especially your heroes.

51:31.422 --> 51:34.716
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

51:34.800 --> 51:38.219
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

51:38.303 --> 51:39.762
That's the way it works.

51:39.847 --> 51:42.598
There's a lot of people, whole
countries who want respect.

51:42.683 --> 51:45.268
And they will pay through
the nose to get it.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.937
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

51:48.022 --> 51:52.066
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

51:54.069 --> 51:56.946
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

51:57.031 --> 51:58.865
I can't believe it.

52:00.534 --> 52:06.080
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.708
Am I good enough now?

52:10.210 --> 52:11.794
Who's super now?

52:11.879 --> 52:14.380
I'm Syndrome!
Your Nemesis and...

52:16.091 --> 52:17.633
Oh, brilliant!

52:35.235 --> 52:38.071
All right, try this one
on for size, big boy.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.274
Gazerbeam.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.621
Kronos?

53:54.898 --> 53:58.651
Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

54:02.030 --> 54:06.367
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

54:06.451 --> 54:10.705
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

54:11.165 --> 54:15.084
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.003
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

54:17.129 --> 54:20.631
and it turned out so
beautiful, I had to continue.

54:20.716 --> 54:24.510
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

54:24.803 --> 54:26.888
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.891
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

54:29.975 --> 54:32.059
That is why I show you my work.

54:32.352 --> 54:33.853
That is why you are here.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.695
Edna Mode.

54:44.114 --> 54:45.448
And guest.

55:02.549 --> 55:04.091
Come. Sit.

55:08.347 --> 55:10.806
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.643
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

55:13.727 --> 55:17.730
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

55:17.814 --> 55:20.733
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

55:21.443 --> 55:25.738
And can also withstand a
temperature of over 1000 degrees.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.909
Completely bulletproof.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.872
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

55:35.249 --> 55:37.875
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

55:37.960 --> 55:42.088
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

55:42.547 --> 55:45.341
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.969
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

55:48.053 --> 55:49.845
Well, he'll look
fabulous anyway.

55:52.015 --> 55:55.893
Your boy's suit I designed to
withstand enormous friction

55:55.978 --> 55:59.563
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

56:00.607 --> 56:02.984
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

56:03.068 --> 56:08.447
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

56:11.994 --> 56:16.372
Your suit can stretch as far as you
can, without injuring yourself,

56:16.456 --> 56:18.499
and still retain its shape.

56:19.293 --> 56:21.544
Virtually indestructible,

56:22.587 --> 56:25.298
yet it breathes like
Egyptian cotton.

56:25.549 --> 56:28.968
As an extra feature, each suit
contains a homing device,

56:29.052 --> 56:33.306
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

56:34.391 --> 56:37.435
Well, darling?
What do you think?

56:37.519 --> 56:42.064
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

56:42.149 --> 56:43.649
Our family is underground.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.902
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

56:46.987 --> 56:49.530
Well, I assumed you
knew, darling.

56:49.614 --> 56:52.491
Why would he keep
secrets from you?

56:52.784 --> 56:55.202
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

56:55.829 --> 56:59.206
Men at Robert's age
are often unstable.

56:59.916 --> 57:02.752
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

57:03.128 --> 57:05.379
Do you know where he is?

57:05.464 --> 57:08.382
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

58:39.891 --> 58:43.018
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

58:47.274 --> 58:49.442
Are you okay?
What happened?

58:51.903 --> 58:55.114
Break surveillance and engage.
Continuing sweep...

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.343
- Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.970
Bob Parr is my husband.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:44.306
I was wondering if you could give me the
number of the hotel he's staying at?

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:48.769
- The number I have is no good.
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:52.147
What do you mean? He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.276
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.934
So, you don't know where he is.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:34.273
Would you like to find out?

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:55.687
I am such an idiot.
I let this happen, you know.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:00.401
The new sports car, the getting in
shape, the blond hair, the lies.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:03.362
Yes, he attempts to
relive the past.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:07.825
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:10.369
What are you talking about?

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:16.083
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.252
What will you do?
Is this a question?

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.796
Show him you remember that
he is Mr. Incredible,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.841
and you will remind
him who you are!

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.220
Well, you know where he is. Go!
Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:32.224
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.893
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:39.314
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.275
I should be back tonight. Late.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.734
You can be in charge
that long, can't you?

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.988
Yeah. But why am I
in charge again?

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.490
Nothing. Just a little
trouble with Daddy.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:52.870
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:56.790
I mean either he's in
trouble, or he's going to be.

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:05.966
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.177
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.678
We all get cool outfits?

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.764
Dash! You come back
here this moment!

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.686
Hey, Snug.
Thanks for getting back.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.564
I know this is short notice, but
I was hoping that I could...

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.609
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.445
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:30.699
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.577
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.871
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:39.291
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:43.837
What makes you think
it's special?

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.673
I don't know.
Why'd Mom try to hide it?

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:58.602
Snug, I'm calling in
a solid you owe me.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:02.314
- What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.483
Let me think.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.286
Island approach. India Golf
niner-niner checking in.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.080
VFR on top. Over.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.794
Island tower, this is
India Golf niner-niner

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:26.213
requesting vectors
to the initial.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.142
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:43.480
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.610
At the same time. Yeah.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:07.379
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.299
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:14.344
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.847
I'm still geeking out about it!

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:21.685
And then you had to just
go and ruin the ride.

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:26.690
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:29.234
Lame, lame, lame.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.736
All right, who did you contact?

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.655
Contact? What are
you talking about?

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:41.830
I am referring to last
night at 23:07 hours

01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:45.042
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:48.086
I didn't know about
the homing device.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:56.637
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:57.721
Who did you contact?

01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.848
I didn't send for a plane.

01:06:59.932 --> 01:07:01.850
Play the transmission.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:06.480
- India Golf checking in.
- Helen!

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.650
So you do know these people.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:12.861
Well, then, I'll send
them a little greeting.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.366
- Ow!
- Violet!

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.909
It's not my fault.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.036
Dash ran away, I knew
I'd get blamed for it.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.954
That's not true!

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.479
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.378
and it's not my fault!
Hundred percent allyours idea!

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:32.297
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.509
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.886
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.764
All right, well, who'd you get?

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:43.225
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.603
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:50.273
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.567
I brought Mozart to
play while he sleeps

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:55.529
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:56.822
- Kari...
- The beauty is

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.574
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.743
I wish my parents played Mozart

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:04.830
because half the time I don't
know what anyone's talking about.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:08.542
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:11.545
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.588
There's really no
need, Mrs. Parr.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:16.383
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.219
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

01:08:19.303 --> 01:08:21.220
Who can handle it?

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:31.439
India Golf niner-niner
transmitting in the blind guard.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.693
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.765
Repeat, disengage.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.058
- Friendlies...
- No!

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.703
Call off the missiles.
I'll do anything.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:12.063
Too late.
Fifteen years too late.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:16.943
Friendlies two-zero Miles
South-southwest of your position.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.321
Angels 10. Track east.
Disengage.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.948
Vi! Put a force field
around the plane.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.783
You said not to use our powers.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.328
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.455
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.294
Mom?

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:35.921
Violet!

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:39.424
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.009
There are children aboard.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:42.801
- There are children aboard!
- No!

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.096
Put a field around us now!

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.640
I've never done one that big.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:48.808
Do it now!

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:55.690
Abort, abort, abort!

01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:28.640
Brace yourselves!

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.941
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.734
I'll tell you what
we're not gonna do.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.404
We're not gonna panic, we're not...
Look out!

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.334
- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.920
We're dead!
We're dead!

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:01.923
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.341
Stop it!

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.719
We are not gonna die!

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.762
Both of you will get a grip.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.265
Or so help me I will
ground you for a month!

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:11.850
Understand?

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.771
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.898
Ah, you'll get over it.

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:22.569
I seem to recall you
prefer to "work alone."

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.706
Release me. Now!

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.291
Or what?

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:37.917
I'll crush her.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.837
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:43.798
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.884
Show me.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.523
I knew you
couldn't do it.

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:03.360
Even when you have
nothing to lose.

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:04.903
You're weak.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.697
And I've outgrown you.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.378
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.380
That way is our best bet.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:26.257
You want to go toward the
people that tried to kill us?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:30.345
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:33.264
I expect you to trust me.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:36.494
What a trooper.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.122
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.040
Thanks, Mom.

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.591
I think your father
is in trouble.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.677
If you haven't noticed, we're
not doing so hot either.

01:13:53.053 --> 01:13:54.262
I'm going to look for him.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:57.140
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:59.476
- What?
- You heard her.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:05.482
Put these on. Your identity is
your most valuable possession.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:06.816
Protect it.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.985
And if anything goes
wrong, use your powers.

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:12.322
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:16.576
Remember the bad guys

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.454
on those shows you used to
watch on Saturday mornings?

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:23.041
Well, these guys are
not like those guys.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.836
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:30.173
They will kill you if
they get the chance.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.550
Do not give them that chance.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:34.385
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.597
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:43.019
Dash, if anything goes wrong, I
want you to run as fast as you can.

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:45.939
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:49.651
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.240
Mom!

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.785
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.830
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:04.249
Shh. It isn't your fault.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.919
It wasn't fair for me to
suddenly ask so much of you.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.505
But things are different now.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.633
And doubt is a luxury we can't
afford anymore, sweetie.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:16.052
You have more power
than you realize.

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:18.888
Don't think. And don't worry.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.474
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.143
It's in your blood.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:04.809
- He's not weak, you know.
- What?

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.186
Valuing life is not weakness.

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:11.065
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.859
I had everything under control.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:15.820
And disregarding it
is not strength.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.656
I called his bluff,
sweetheart, that's all.

01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:21.242
I knew he wouldn't have
it in him to actually...

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:24.078
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life!

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:40.678
Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.568
A rocket?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Hey!

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:35.603
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:37.438
What do you think
is going on here?

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.649
You think we're on vacation?

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.860
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.196
Or worse,
their marriage.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.073
Their marriage?

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:51.869
So, the bad guys are trying to
wreck Mom and Dad's marriage.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.122
Forget it. You're so immature.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:57.416
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:01.337
I'm not gonna leave the cave.
Sheesh.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:43.379
Cool!

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.842
Roger.
We are ready for launch.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.272
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.953
ETA two-niner.
Over.

01:21:19.499 --> 01:21:22.210
TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.006
Not responding to IFF.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.883
IRCM reads negative.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.053
- Bob.
- What?

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.387
I didn't say anything.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:04.377
Identification, please.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.170
Hey!

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:09.257
- Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks!
- What? What?

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:10.800
There. That one.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.510
Voice key incorrect.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.178
"Voice key"?

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.931
Voice key incorrect.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.683
Wait a second.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:22.353
- What do we do?
- Run!

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:24.522
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.947
Intruder alert.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:57.305
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.807
In fact, there's no time at all.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:02.018
- Please...
- Why are you here?

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:07.106
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:10.735
Family
survived the crash.

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.820
They're here on the island!

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.280
They're alive?

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.795
- Helen?
- Hello.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.048
You must be Mrs...

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:35.217
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:38.262
That's what I was doing.
Let go of me!

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.432
Let go, you lousy,
lying, unfaithful creep!

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.353
How could I betray
the perfect woman?

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.271
Oh, you're referring to me now?

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.522
Where are the kids?

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.399
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:53.861
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

01:23:53.945 --> 01:23:55.746
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:59.367
They stowed away. You're not
striking the proper tone.

01:24:07.667 --> 01:24:08.788
Think they're supers?

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.212
Dash, remember what Mom said.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:12.797
- What?
- Stop talking!

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.050
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:17.843
- What?
- Run!

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:21.055
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:23.974
Show yourself!

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.036
Hey!

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:34.920
Ha, ha!

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.897
I'm alive. Yeah!

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.900
Uh-oh.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.764
I should've told you I
was fired, I admit it.

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:10.140
But I didn't want you to worry.

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.559
You didn't want me to worry?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:14.520
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:17.815
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:23.153
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:37.543
You can't hide from me.

01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:45.968
- There you are.
- Hey!

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.932
Don't touch my sister!

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.942
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:03.694
Whatever you do, don't stop!

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.212
Mom! Dad! Hey!

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.132
Kids.

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:27.009
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:29.595
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:49.448
I love you.

01:28:49.532 --> 01:28:51.033
Wow. Violet: Whoa.

01:29:05.715 --> 01:29:07.091
Time out!

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:12.054
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:16.475
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:21.313
You married Elastigirl?
Whoa!

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.817
And got busy!

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:29.488
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:32.157
Oh, this is just too good!

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:35.703
- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:40.791
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:44.211
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:47.047
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:51.844
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.763
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were!

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:59.017
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.854
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:05.983
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.234
I'll give them heroics.

01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:10.738
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:13.991
And when I'm old and I've had
my fun, I'll sell my inventions

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:18.412
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:21.331
And when
everyone's super

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.170
no one will be.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:53.572
Fire at will!

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.707
It's
overwhelming the tanks.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:05.000
I'm sorry.

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:09.254
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:13.133
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:16.136
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:17.346
Shh. Don't interrupt.

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:20.140
So caught up in the
past that I...

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.146
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.315
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:32.402
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.155
but I think it's time
we wind down now.

01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:40.035
We need to get back
to the mainland.

01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:42.788
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:53.924
Where are all the guards?

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.968
Go, go!

01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:03.267
Hey, every time
they run, you take a shot.

01:32:19.397 --> 01:32:21.678
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:24.204
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:26.206
How about a rocket?

01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:34.006
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:36.800
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:42.264
Wait. I bet Syndrome's
changed the password by now.

01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:45.142
- How do I get into the computer?
- Say please.

01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:03.076
- Honey?
- What?

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:04.995
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:08.749
Where is my supersuit?

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.919
- I put it away.
- Where?

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:15.339
- Why do you need to know?
- I need it!

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:18.425
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:20.385
We've been planning this
dinner for two months!

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:23.847
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:27.434
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:29.686
"Greater good"?
I am your wife!

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:32.689
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:37.778
Run!

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:40.864
My baby!

01:33:45.536 --> 01:33:47.913
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

01:33:47.997 --> 01:33:51.249
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:56.296
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

01:33:59.258 --> 01:34:01.134
All right, stand back.

01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:09.267
Someone needs to teach this
hunk of metal a few manners.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:12.312
Ha, ha!

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:42.801
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:47.264
How you doing, honey?

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:49.891
Do I have to answer?

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:55.355
Kids, strap yourselves
down like I told you.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:01.403
Here we go, honey.

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:03.113
Ready, Violet?

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:06.116
Ready? Now!

01:35:09.912 --> 01:35:11.455
This is gonna be rough.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.214
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

01:35:21.299 --> 01:35:22.924
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:24.889
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.722
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.599
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:32.309
Get in the right Lane! Signal!

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:33.935
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:03.840
Is everybody okay back there?

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:07.677
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:13.558
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:17.145
While what? I watch helplessly
from the sidelines?

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:19.689
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:22.442
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

01:36:22.527 --> 01:36:24.361
I'm with you for
better or worse.

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.446
I have to do this alone.

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.448
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:30.408
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:31.743
- Then what?
- I'm not...

01:36:31.828 --> 01:36:33.829
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:35.956
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.083
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.085
I can't lose you again!

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:44.381
I can't. Not again.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.967
I'm not strong enough.

01:36:55.685 --> 01:36:58.478
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

01:36:58.563 --> 01:36:59.771
I don't know what'll happen.

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.858
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.281
Vi! Dash! No!

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:20.167
Violet?

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.922
- Dad!
- Go, go!

01:37:35.975 --> 01:37:39.102
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.531
Frozone!

01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:52.824
Yeah!

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.703
Bob!

01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080
Hey!

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.640
Syndrome's remote!

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:27.734
The remote controls the robot!

01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:32.322
Throw it, throw it!

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:33.657
Go long!

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:46.086
Got it!

01:38:50.841 --> 01:38:52.926
Honey, take out its guns!

01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:01.268
Gotcha!

01:39:47.356 --> 01:39:49.024
Mom, I've got it!
I've got the remote!

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:53.403
A remote? A remote
that controls what?

01:39:56.449 --> 01:39:57.449
The robot?

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:06.875
It's coming back!

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.654
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:16.426
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:21.431
itself.

01:40:21.515 --> 01:40:22.724
It's getting closer!

01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:24.934
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:28.021
It's not
doing anything.

01:40:28.105 --> 01:40:30.145
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

01:40:35.946 --> 01:40:37.113
Honey!

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.413
Wait a minute.
Press that button again!

01:40:46.957 --> 01:40:49.542
No, the other one!
The first one!

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:50.835
First button!
Got it!

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.545
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:56.132
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

01:40:56.217 --> 01:40:57.967
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

01:40:58.094 --> 01:41:00.553
- Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.972
A closer target!
You got one shot!

01:41:06.018 --> 01:41:07.018
Everybody duck!

01:41:31.085 --> 01:41:32.210
Hey, Zone.

01:41:38.509 --> 01:41:40.343
Huh? No!

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:44.514
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:48.768
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:54.607
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:56.985
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

01:42:00.406 --> 01:42:02.699
We've frozen all of
Syndrome's assets.

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:06.786
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:08.913
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

01:42:08.998 --> 01:42:10.623
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:12.750
Let the politicians
figure that one out.

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:16.463
I've been asked to assure you we'll
take care of everything else.

01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:17.547
You did good, Bob.

01:42:18.757 --> 01:42:23.136
Hi, this is Kari. I have a
question about Jack-Jack...

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.596
Come on. We're in a limo.

01:42:25.097 --> 01:42:27.640
Hey, you're wearing
your hair back?

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:30.560
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:33.313
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:35.648
Not as cool as you
running on water.

01:42:35.733 --> 01:42:39.527
That was sweet when you snagged
that bad guy with your arm

01:42:39.612 --> 01:42:42.238
and whiplashed him into
the other guy. Sweet!

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:44.991
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- It's me.

01:42:45.075 --> 01:42:48.328
Jack-Jack is fine, but weird
things are happening.

01:42:48.412 --> 01:42:52.040
Jack-Jack's still fine, but I'm
getting really weirded out!

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.125
When are you coming back?

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.628
Aced those guys that
tried to kill us!

01:42:56.712 --> 01:43:00.840
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:03.510
I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!

01:43:03.594 --> 01:43:06.513
Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:08.598
I need help, Mrs...

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.308
Bob, listen to this.

01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:12.435
I'm gonna
call the police...

01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:14.521
Hi, this is Kari.

01:43:14.605 --> 01:43:18.608
Sorry for freaking out, but
your baby has special needs.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.944
Thanks for sending
a replacement.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:23.238
I didn't call a replacement.

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:31.079
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:36.000
You took away my future.

01:43:36.085 --> 01:43:39.462
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:42.757
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:46.511
And in time, who knows, he
might make a good sidekick.

01:43:51.016 --> 01:43:54.310
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:11.244
What's happening?

01:44:17.167 --> 01:44:20.336
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

01:44:24.466 --> 01:44:25.925
Throw me.

01:44:30.306 --> 01:44:31.764
Bob, throw me!

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.022
No!

01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:44.569
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

01:44:44.653 --> 01:44:46.029
I'll get your son!

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.365
Oh, no.

01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:03.755
Look at Mommy, honey. Don't look down.
Mommy's got you.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:06.591
Everything is all right.

01:45:22.232 --> 01:45:23.858
That's my girl.

01:45:24.443 --> 01:45:26.819
Does this mean we
have to move again?

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:31.866
Oh, man.

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:34.619
That was totally wicked!

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:54.347
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:57.350
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

01:45:57.434 --> 01:45:58.893
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:45:58.977 --> 01:46:01.688
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:03.731
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

01:46:04.066 --> 01:46:07.402
I feel different.
Is different okay?

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:10.780
Hey, different is... Different is great.

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:12.824
Would you...

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:14.575
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.369
- you and I...
- Yeah?

01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:17.787
- Do you...
- Shh.

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:21.165
I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn.
Okay?

01:46:22.084 --> 01:46:24.210
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

01:46:24.294 --> 01:46:27.004
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:34.554
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

01:46:34.638 --> 01:46:37.557
Come on, run!
Pick up the pace.

01:46:37.641 --> 01:46:38.683
Run!

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:40.143
Pull back, pull back!

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:42.770
Pace it. Slow down
just a little bit.

01:46:43.397 --> 01:46:44.897
- Make it close!
- Second.

01:46:44.982 --> 01:46:47.650
Close
second, yeah!

01:46:52.364 --> 01:46:53.948
That's my boy!

01:46:54.324 --> 01:46:55.992
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.956
I didn't know what the
heck you wanted me to do.

01:47:11.008 --> 01:47:14.010
Behold the Underminer!

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:17.138
I am
always beneath you,

01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:20.183
but nothing is beneath me!

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:26.230
I hereby declare
war on peace and happiness!

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:34.940
Soon all will tremble before me!
