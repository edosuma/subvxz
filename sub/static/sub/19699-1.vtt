00:07.398 --> 00:08.573
Evening, gents.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.358
Good evening.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.929
Hello, there.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.847
Good evening.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.024
Well, it is now.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.851
What can I do for you,
mister?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.506
If I could trouble you
for a moment of your time.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.478
You a doctor?

00:43.521 --> 00:45.567
I am.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.048
And do you like it?

00:48.091 --> 00:51.138
Has its moments.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.053
Do you like what you do?

00:53.096 --> 00:54.967
Has its moments.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.819
Well, socialism
tends to do that.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.691
But it the path man
must inevitably tread,

01:22.734 --> 01:23.692
or we are all doomed.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.824
It is the only path
to utopia.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.000
You have too much time
on your hands, Wells.

01:28.044 --> 01:30.742
Perhaps you should think
about dating again.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.570
You can't stay
divorced forever.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.485
That's what I've been
telling him.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.661
I consider myself single,
not divorced,

01:36.705 --> 01:37.793
if you must brand me.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.838
And, yes,
I can stay single forever.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.449
I find it
far more desirable

01:41.492 --> 01:43.146
than the suffocating effects
of marriage.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.410
You see, that is precisely
what love is supposed to do --

01:46.454 --> 01:47.368
suffocate.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.804
If you read a poem
now and then

01:48.847 --> 01:50.675
instead of science books,
you'd know that.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.808
Poetically speaking,
I believe the exact opposite.

01:52.851 --> 01:57.029
To love
is to exhale fully,

01:57.073 --> 02:00.032
knowing that even
if it were your last breath,

02:00.076 --> 02:02.644
you're complete
because you had found

02:02.687 --> 02:05.081
the very reason
for your existence.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.692
I knew you were
a romantic!

02:12.697 --> 02:13.916
Dr. Stevenson.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.004
Mrs. Nelsen.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.179
Good evening.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.398
May I take your coat?

02:17.441 --> 02:19.008
Thank you.

02:22.142 --> 02:22.881
John!

02:22.925 --> 02:24.231
You're here.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.623
I had you
almost written off.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.582
A doctor's hours
are not his own, I'm afraid.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.844
Good evening, gents.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.280
John!

02:30.324 --> 02:32.978
Right. Now that we're all here,
let's get on with it.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.677
By now you all know
my obsession with time travel.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.679
Oh, yes,
how is your novel coming?

02:37.722 --> 02:39.028
Have you finished it yet?

02:39.071 --> 02:40.595
You could say
I'm in the research phase.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.771
And how does one
research time travel?

02:42.814 --> 02:45.904
He constructs a time machine
and travels through time.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.776
So, your book
is nonfiction.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.954
So, where is
this time machine?

02:53.260 --> 02:54.217
See here.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.349
Oh, please.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.437
All right.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.047
Good lord, Wells!

02:58.090 --> 03:01.268
You actually built
the bloody thing.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.009
How much
have you spent on it?

03:11.843 --> 03:13.976
How is this thing
supposed to work?

03:14.019 --> 03:16.979
You set the time and date
with the dials on the board.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.242
The solar cylinders
yield enough energy

03:19.286 --> 03:22.027
to compress the machine
into subatomic particles,

03:22.071 --> 03:24.378
resulting
in the thermodynamic suspension

03:24.421 --> 03:25.901
of molecular activity,

03:25.944 --> 03:28.686
which allows it to journey
across the fourth dimension

03:28.730 --> 03:31.341
from one time sphere
to the other.

03:31.385 --> 03:34.518
I'm genuinely concerned
for your sanity.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.781
You've taken
this too far.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.828
And once you leave,
can you come back?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.612
We don't want him back.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.527
The safety lock
automatically returns

03:43.571 --> 03:44.876
the machine
to its starting date,

03:44.920 --> 03:49.229
unless you have this key
to countermand the device.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.491
Have you taken it
for a test-run?

03:50.534 --> 03:52.101
I'm doing
some final tests now.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.538
I think that's enough.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.192
-More drinks.
-No, this is getting...

03:58.412 --> 04:00.979
He's lost his mind.

04:03.025 --> 04:06.115
So, where to --
the past or the future?

04:06.158 --> 04:10.250
Well, the future, or course,
away from all you cynics.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.643
In five generations,
utopia will have come to pass.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.297
And that's where I belong.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.647
Ah, yes, your utopia.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.649
Where mankind
lives in peace

04:18.693 --> 04:21.565
with no war, no crime,
no disease or famine.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.132
It's inevitable.

04:23.175 --> 04:26.483
Science and technology will
advance beyond all imagination,

04:26.527 --> 04:28.703
forcing society
to perfect itself.

04:28.746 --> 04:29.921
You're a surgeon, John.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.141
Think of what the future holds
for medicine.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.403
Think of the cures.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.318
Health and happiness
will be the daily course.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.407
Mankind will finally know
true equality.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.322
Mankind hasn't changed
in 200 years.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.105
We're animals.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.455
We hunt.
We're hunted.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.674
That's the way it has been
and always will be.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.067
The future
will prove you wrong.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.373
Very well.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.201
Let's go, right now.
Let's take it for a whirl.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.334
Well, I-I still have a few tests
that I need to conduct.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.466
Scared to try it out?

04:52.509 --> 04:54.119
Hardly.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.252
H.G., I've known you for years.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.993
You have
all these brilliant ideas

04:58.036 --> 05:00.038
that only find life
on the page.I'm a writer, John.

05:00.082 --> 05:03.128
I fail to see
how that makes me a coward.All you do is write!

05:03.172 --> 05:05.174
It's the only release
your fear grants you.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.437
You write about life
without actually living it.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.873
In your opinion.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.354
Imagine who you could be
if you didn't live in fear.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.442
Or more importantly,

05:12.486 --> 05:14.357
imagine the stories
you could write

05:14.401 --> 05:16.316
if your life
were full of adventure.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.622
You might finally
get that novel published.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.714
Excuse me, Mr. Wells?

05:26.282 --> 05:29.720
Scotland Yard
is at the door.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.854
What is going on?

05:32.897 --> 05:34.029
The Ripper has struck.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.639
A woman was found
in an alley near here.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.467
We're conducting
a house-to-house search.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.729
Absolutely.
Wh-Whatever you need.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.340
-Pardon me, sir.
-I apologize, my friends.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.776
It's getting --
I think we best be off.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.081
My men will see them
home safely.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.997
Where is Dr. Stevenson?
He left his bag.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.173
No, he was just here.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.001
-Allow me.
-Excuse me!

05:50.045 --> 05:52.221
That's the personal property
of a prestigious surgeon!

05:56.878 --> 06:00.621
I believe surgeons use scalpels,
not butchers' knives.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.013
Where is the doctor?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.450
I last saw him
in the basement.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.147
It's empty.
There's nobody down there.

06:05.190 --> 06:08.150
Well, he couldn't of gone far.
Quickly, comb the streets!

08:44.654 --> 08:47.788
This time machine
was unearthed 15 years ago

08:47.831 --> 08:50.617
in the basement
in H.G. Wells' London flat.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.707
It was restored, and is on loan
from Anders Enterprises.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.231
It's believed to have served
as inspiration

08:56.274 --> 08:58.755
for Wells' first novel,
"The Time Machine."

09:01.062 --> 09:03.847
Somebody's getting out.
Look.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.599
Hey!

09:30.091 --> 09:31.440
Sit here.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.050
Don't move.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.067
I'm in America.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.070
Hey, Willy.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.289
Good afternoon.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.639
Loving this --
this whole look.

09:56.683 --> 10:00.643
Can you check online to see
if any of this has gotten out?

10:00.687 --> 10:03.124
Please, sit.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.605
Oh!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.053
So, really, who are you?

10:19.096 --> 10:20.794
Well, it's rather
complicated.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.405
Perhaps it's best I speak
to someone in charge.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.068
Jane Walker,
assistant curator.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.460
Assistant.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.593
Is the actual curator in?
May I speak with him?

10:37.637 --> 10:41.989
It's a she, too,
but keep digging your grave.

10:42.032 --> 10:45.035
Of course! Things have changed
a great deal since 1893!

10:45.079 --> 10:47.995
I can no longer make social
and cultural assumptions.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.867
My apologies.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.216
May I keep this?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.262
Okay, so, really,
who are you?

10:54.305 --> 10:55.742
It's apparent, isn't it?

10:55.785 --> 10:58.005
It's some publicity stunt --
Yeah.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.267
What is it,
some stage play

10:59.310 --> 11:01.095
about H.G. Wells
in the Village somewhere?

11:01.138 --> 11:02.400
Is it opening night
tonight?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.011
I beg your pardon?

11:04.054 --> 11:06.883
How did you get past the sensors
and inside the actual exhibit?

11:06.927 --> 11:09.103
I'm certain you won't believe
the answer to that question.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.582
I think you
want to get arrested.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.932
You get arrested,
make some news,

11:11.975 --> 11:13.368
you got free press
for whatever

11:13.411 --> 11:15.457
the little avant-garde
production you're involved with.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.067
Oh, I can assure you,
I am not an actor.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.417
Right!
You are H.G. Wells.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.418
Yes.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.550
You wrote
"The Time Machine."

11:21.593 --> 11:22.725
Well, no, not yet,
I haven't.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.205
But apparently
I'm published,

11:24.248 --> 11:26.076
which is incredibly exciting
to learn.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.426
Look, I can appreciate this
on some level, but no.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.341
You will not be
getting arrested today.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.082
There will be
no free press,

11:32.126 --> 11:35.042
despite the fact I like you
better than the other guy.

11:35.085 --> 11:35.869
What other guy?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.392
Your friend?

11:37.435 --> 11:39.437
Popped out of the time machine
with the same period getup.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.222
Wasn't nearly as polite,
by the way.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.919
This other gentleman,
where is he?

11:42.963 --> 11:45.487
So, a few tourists posted pics
on Twitter on Instagram,

11:45.530 --> 11:47.619
but so far, no news outlets
have picked it up.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.795
Great.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.014
Mr. Wells,
this is where we say goodbye.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.581
Please, the other man?

11:52.624 --> 11:54.757
He hasn't broken character once.
It's pretty amazing.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.237
Please, I must find him.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.892
No one here is a amused
by your fake accent and costume.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.764
If I catch you within spitting
distance of this museum,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.593
you will prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

12:04.636 --> 12:05.637
Do you understand?

12:05.681 --> 12:07.422
It is urgent
that I find this man.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.598
Willy, will you please
escort this man out?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.295
No. No, please.
I beg of you.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.864
Come on, let's go.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.953
Please,
I must find this man!

12:16.997 --> 12:18.259
This way.
Come on.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.957
Eh, the other one
was hotter.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.219
I like this one.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.005
He's cute.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.450
He really does look like him.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.807
Please, the gentleman
who was here earlier --
When was it? What time?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.243
-About an hour ago.
-Did he say anything?

12:46.287 --> 12:47.767
-Where he might be going?
-Said he wanted to explore

12:47.810 --> 12:49.333
the city, see the sights,
asked about a hotel,

12:49.377 --> 12:52.206
so I sent him to the Renaissance
in Times Square.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.251
Renaissance
in Times Square.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.297
Brilliant.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.689
Where is that?

12:57.733 --> 13:00.040
Out these doors, turn right,
walk uptown 50 blocks.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.215
You can't miss it.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.346
Thank you.

13:02.390 --> 13:05.393
And may I remark
how happy I am

13:05.436 --> 13:07.874
to see that race relations
have improved since 1893.

13:07.917 --> 13:08.613
Uh-huh.

13:08.657 --> 13:09.832
I knew that one day,

13:09.876 --> 13:12.269
the color of a man's skin
would dissipate

13:12.313 --> 13:15.011
and we would all live
side by side as brothers.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.579
Oh, yeah, we're all
one big happy family.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.688
What are you,
in "Les Mis"?

14:23.732 --> 14:26.039
I don't think so.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.171
Patek Philippe.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.999
Yellow gold.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.175
This is a real
collector's item.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.742
I can give you $12,000.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.396
It belonged to my father.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.920
I'll accept nothing less
than $20,000.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.835
$15,000 cash.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.752
We skip the paperwork.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.145
Deal.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.060
I'll need a credit card
and an I.D.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.279
I have a tragic
predicament.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.151
I'm in town for a show,
you see,

14:51.194 --> 14:53.936
and I've lost my luggage
and identification papers.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.504
All I have
is this ridiculous costume.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.114
Oh, that's just horrible.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.377
Did the airlines
lose your bags?

15:00.421 --> 15:03.772
It appears so, yes.

15:03.815 --> 15:07.254
I have money,
but that's all, I'm afraid.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.952
Let me speak
to my supervisor.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.955
We can usually
work something out.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.590
Did you lose
your luggage, too?

15:39.634 --> 15:40.940
You -- You saw him?
Where is he?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.245
He wanted to do
some shopping,

15:42.289 --> 15:43.725
so we sent him over
to 5th Avenue.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.814
5th Avenue?
Right, and where is that?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.120
You'll never find him.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.252
Why don't you wait for him
at the hotel bar?

15:49.296 --> 15:50.601
He shouldn't be long.

15:50.645 --> 15:53.169
I'll send him over
as soon as he arrives.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.692
Thank you.

15:54.736 --> 15:55.911
It's wet!

15:55.955 --> 15:57.957
Look, there's water
all over the floor.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.741
It's literally
soaking wet. Why?

15:59.784 --> 16:01.134
The tour guide
said it was like this.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.265
He couldn't explain it,
either.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.788
Ms. Walker?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.790
Doug Lawson, head of security
for Anders Enterprises.

16:05.834 --> 16:09.055
I understand there was a breach
in the Wells Exhibit today?

16:09.098 --> 16:11.057
Not exactly a breach, no.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.928
Then what was it?

16:12.972 --> 16:16.018
Ms. Walker,
this is Vanessa Anders.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.063
Yes, of course.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.412
Ms. Anders,
it is such an honor

16:18.455 --> 16:19.891
and a pleasure
to meet you.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.850
We were informed
that there were two men

16:21.893 --> 16:23.417
caught inside
the time machine.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.375
It was a slight breach.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.160
But I can assure you,

16:27.203 --> 16:29.075
the exhibit was not harmed
in any way.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.598
Can we see
the police report?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.078
We chose not to involve
the police.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.644
It was a minor incident,

16:33.688 --> 16:35.298
and the last thing we wanted
was to call attention to it.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.953
Did you get their information?
Where can we find them?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.957
I don't have that.
I realize how this looks.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.265
But in my defense,
most infractions are harmless.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.442
And it's not our policy
to arrest guests at the museum.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.749
As owner of this exhibit,
I find that answer unacceptable.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.751
You need to find these men,
Ms. Walker,

16:53.795 --> 16:55.797
or I'll see to it
that Anders Enterprises

16:55.840 --> 16:58.408
files charges against you
and the museum.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.714
Do you understand?

17:01.324 --> 17:04.197
12 dead
in latest school shooting...

17:04.240 --> 17:05.763
We need to build a wall...

17:05.807 --> 17:07.896
-The suicide bomber...
-...a mass execution.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.768
This is weapons
that are so destructive

17:10.812 --> 17:12.422
that the world could end.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.642
...attacks killed
14 ISIS fighter...

17:14.685 --> 17:16.383
ISIS is the worst
of the worst.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.472
His next target
will probably be...

17:18.515 --> 17:21.953
-...too many nuclear weapons... -Anarchists...

17:21.997 --> 17:24.478
Well, bless my soul.

17:26.132 --> 17:29.396
Literally the last person
on Earth I expected to see.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.962
Something to drink, sir?

17:31.006 --> 17:34.705
Whiskey, neat, and another
of whatever he's drinking.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.751
So?
What do you think?

17:36.794 --> 17:39.710
I know --
I look absolutely dashing.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.190
I must applaud you.

17:41.234 --> 17:44.933
I never thought your little
device would actually work.

17:44.976 --> 17:45.934
How did you find me?

17:45.977 --> 17:47.457
The details
aren't important.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.719
Yeah, I suppose not.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.418
I wasn't sure the machine
would return to you.

17:51.461 --> 17:54.073
Then I realized
I didn't have the key.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.860
To you,
the Columbus of a new age.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.776
Tell me, how did you
muster the courage to find me?

18:01.819 --> 18:04.257
I'm not here to engage
in idle banter, John.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.214
We must be off.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.129
Oh.
And where are we going?

18:07.173 --> 18:08.478
To the time machine.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.046
I'm obliged to take you
back to Scotland Yard

18:11.090 --> 18:13.483
to face the consequences
of your actions.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.572
So Victorian.
You'll take me back?

18:15.616 --> 18:18.140
And how do you propose
to do that, by force?

18:20.969 --> 18:24.233
Be reasonable, John.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.061
You must pay
for what you've done.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.413
You can't stay here.
We don't belong here.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.850
There it is, H.G.
There's your utopia.

18:32.894 --> 18:35.244
Nothing but violence
and bloodshed.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.420
Not quite
what you envisioned.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.987
"We don't belong here"?

18:39.030 --> 18:41.946
On the contrary --
I belong here completely.

18:41.990 --> 18:45.211
In our time, I was a freak.
Today, I'm an amateur.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.429
Stop it, John,
this instant.

18:46.473 --> 18:47.996
You know you can walk
into a shop here

18:48.039 --> 18:49.432
and purchase a rifle
or a revolver,

18:49.476 --> 18:50.520
and it's perfectly legal?

18:50.564 --> 18:53.175
These people encourage it.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.134
No, I'm not going anywhere.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.440
I've yet to begin
in this age.

18:57.484 --> 19:01.314
It's you who should run along
back to your timid life.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.968
Of course,
I'll be needing the key.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
Well, I can't have you chasing
after me across centuries.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.321
Who knows where I might
want to venture to next?

19:08.364 --> 19:10.279
Well, I don't have it
with me.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.281
Herbert George, come on.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.805
I've played countless
games of chess with you,

19:14.849 --> 19:17.068
and the one thing
you cannot do is bluff.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.113
I want that key.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.811
Now, what you feel

19:20.855 --> 19:24.206
is a four-inch steel curved
blade with a reverse grip.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.643
Rather expensive
at $69.95,

19:26.687 --> 19:28.123
but I'm certain
I'll get my money's worth.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.777
What are you doing?
Everyone can see.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.083
And no one cares!

19:32.127 --> 19:34.434
Isn't it glorious?

19:34.477 --> 19:37.001
Give me the key, or I'll slice
into your femoral artery.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.960
You'll topple to the floor
and bleed out,

19:39.003 --> 19:41.223
and I will disappear
before anyone blinks twice.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.323
Hey!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.296
Are you all right, man?

20:12.036 --> 20:13.734
Right in front of my cab.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.564
Step away, sir.
Ambulance is on the way.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.087
Don't move.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.363
How ya doin'?
How's your head?

20:34.407 --> 20:35.538
It hurts.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.801
Um, may I ask,
where am I?

20:37.845 --> 20:39.281
Manhattan General.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.631
You're lucky you just suffered
a slight concussion is all.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.285
I'll let the doctor know
you're awake,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.287
and you have a friend
on the way.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.897
A friend?
What friend?

20:46.941 --> 20:48.029
No wallet, no I.D.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.900
All I had
was a business card to call.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.470
Ms. Walker!

20:54.514 --> 20:55.428
Hi.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.690
Um, are you okay?

20:56.733 --> 20:57.865
The hospital called,

20:57.908 --> 20:59.780
and I tried to explain
that we just met.

20:59.823 --> 21:00.824
What happened?

21:00.868 --> 21:03.740
A big yellow motorcar
ran me down.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.482
You were hit by a taxi?

21:11.008 --> 21:12.183
What is that?

21:12.227 --> 21:15.361
That is a key
that I thought I'd lost.

21:17.624 --> 21:18.755
Ooh.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.804
Here, let me help you.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.939
Thank you.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.246
Please level with me.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.727
I'm in a lot of trouble.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.730
The time machine exhibit
is my responsibility,

21:36.773 --> 21:39.733
and I don't wanna
lose my job.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.822
Who are you?

21:41.865 --> 21:45.608
Very well.

21:45.652 --> 21:48.045
My name is Sigmund --

21:48.089 --> 21:49.308
Don't say "Freud."

21:49.351 --> 21:50.091
Kemp.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.049
And you were correct.

21:52.093 --> 21:55.792
I -- I am an actor.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.794
And I am playing
H.G. Wells

21:57.838 --> 22:00.319
in a small production
about his life.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.713
I am sorry about what happened
at the museum earlier.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.368
So, you're an actor,
you're from London,

22:06.412 --> 22:08.675
and this is all
just a big prank?

22:08.718 --> 22:09.763
Yes.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.982
Anything else?

22:12.026 --> 22:12.809
No.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.463
We're good.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.465
Well, thanks
for blowing up my day.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.815
It's been most stressful
and inconvenient,

22:18.859 --> 22:21.340
but I hope you
feel better.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.081
Again,
my sincerest apologies.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.953
Thank you.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.738
And break a leg.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.307
It's all a stunt,
like I said.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.657
Call that creepy guy
from Anders Enterprises

22:34.701 --> 22:36.964
and tell him it's much ado
about nothing.

22:37.007 --> 22:40.184
No, the second one --
cute one.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.535
Okay, I'm going home.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.885
Call me
if something explodes.

22:58.638 --> 23:02.381
Can you just wait here
one second?

23:02.424 --> 23:03.817
Hey.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.384
Are you okay?

23:05.427 --> 23:08.648
Oh. Just a little
light-headed is all.

23:08.691 --> 23:09.605
Oh!

23:09.649 --> 23:10.867
Where are you going?

23:10.911 --> 23:12.826
Did the hospital
release you?

23:12.869 --> 23:17.221
I really must find
my friend.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.572
I really think
you should rest.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.792
Do you have
anywhere to go?

23:22.836 --> 23:26.492
I-I-I'm fine, thank you.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.801
Okay, here.
Let me help you.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.194
Come on.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.025
Oh, no,
I'm not getting into that.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.680
Oh, no, you'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.508
Come on.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.598
Yes, Herbert George Wells.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.296
He was struck by a --

23:48.339 --> 23:50.124
Can you hear me?

23:52.082 --> 23:54.084
Hello? Yes.

23:54.128 --> 23:57.131
Yes, he was struck by
a motor vehicle in Times Square.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.743
No, this is the third
hospital I've called.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.876
Yes, I'll hold.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.139
Easy.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.923
Oh, this is lovely!

24:06.967 --> 24:08.098
Thank you.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.714
So, do you live alone?

24:14.757 --> 24:16.280
Maybe.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.065
Oh no, you're perfectly safe
with me, Ms. Walker, I promise.

24:18.108 --> 24:21.416
Okay, well, you can
freshen up and rest some,

24:21.460 --> 24:22.896
but then you have to leave

24:22.939 --> 24:24.985
because my stray-puppy-dog
syndrome only goes so far.

24:25.028 --> 24:25.725
Are you hungry?

24:25.768 --> 24:28.641
Oh, yes, thank you.

24:28.684 --> 24:32.340
So, how does one
become a museum curator?

24:32.383 --> 24:35.038
When one has to pay
the rent.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.867
I majored in art history because
I absolutely loved it,

24:37.911 --> 24:41.349
but I really didn't think
it through in terms of careers.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.524
It's not forever.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.221
I hope you like Chinese.

24:46.136 --> 24:50.010
So, I take it
that you're single.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.099
Yes.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.753
Um, this is from
last night.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.929
What about you?

24:55.972 --> 24:57.844
I'm divorced.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.933
Do men and women
even fancy marriage today?

24:59.976 --> 25:01.761
You mean in America?

25:01.804 --> 25:05.765
Yes, we fancy marriage,
particularly my mother.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.507
She wants grandkids yesterday,
but she doesn't understand

25:08.550 --> 25:10.813
that the benchmark
for that stuff has changed.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.642
I'm still in my first career.
I can have kids when I'm 50.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.907
So, you prefer
being single.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.649
Yeah.

25:20.693 --> 25:21.911
Not always.

25:21.955 --> 25:25.915
But apparently,
I'm too mediocre to date.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.264
Excuse me?

25:27.308 --> 25:28.962
One of the joys
of online dating.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.746
You'd be surprised
what guys say

25:30.790 --> 25:32.966
when they don't have to say it
to your face.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.358
A man said that to you?

25:34.402 --> 25:36.796
Well, what he said exactly
was that I was

25:36.839 --> 25:40.234
"curiously unspecial
and intriguingly mediocre."

25:40.277 --> 25:41.714
That's appalling!

25:41.757 --> 25:44.586
He was a wanna-be songwriter
who talked in bad lyrics.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.502
Any man who says that to a lady
is no gentleman.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.852
Which is why I quit Tinder.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.812
But, I mean,
it does have some truth to it.

25:52.855 --> 25:56.467
I moved to New York to have
this crazy, exciting life.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.818
And that hasn't
materialized yet,

25:58.861 --> 26:00.471
so, yeah, you could say

26:00.515 --> 26:04.214
my life is pretty unspecial
at the moment.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.008
-You haven't eaten.
-Oh.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.183
Would you like
something to drink?

26:16.226 --> 26:17.706
Let's get you
something to drink.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.794
Thank you.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.131
Is the music
always this loud?

26:51.174 --> 26:53.350
Yeah.

26:53.394 --> 26:56.049
You wanna dance?

26:56.092 --> 26:58.878
I can think of a few things
I'd like to do.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.275
I found some clothes
from my ex.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.363
It ended quickly,

27:06.407 --> 27:08.670
and he never came back
for his stuff.

27:08.714 --> 27:13.066
You can shower
and freshen up in here.

27:13.109 --> 27:16.199
Hot water takes a minute.

27:16.243 --> 27:20.639
Razor, deodorant,
and toothbrush.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.384
Thank you.

27:27.428 --> 27:30.039
Enjoy your shower.

27:59.373 --> 28:00.679
Aah!

28:02.419 --> 28:03.333
-Oh!
-Oh!

28:03.377 --> 28:04.683
Oh, what --

28:04.726 --> 28:07.598
Uh, what -- what happened?

28:09.383 --> 28:10.776
I was attempting
to use your razor,

28:10.819 --> 28:12.386
but it's more complicated
than it looked.

28:12.429 --> 28:16.999
Well, it's old.
It's from my ex-boyfriend.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.305
Here, let me help you.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.356
Why is he your ex-boyfriend?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.706
He wasn't the one.

28:27.749 --> 28:31.710
Truth is, I'm the problem.
I'm a bad picker.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.974
I always end up
with the wrong guy.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.106
And why is that?

28:37.150 --> 28:38.760
Because I don't trust
anyone, ever.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.023
And then I realize I don't trust
anyone, so I try to.

28:41.067 --> 28:44.984
And then, I end up
trusting the wrong one.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.725
It never fails.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.814
Are all women today
as self-aware as you?

28:48.857 --> 28:50.772
No, I'm the only one.

28:50.816 --> 28:54.210
They gave me an award
and everything.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.387
I find you fascinating,
Ms. Walker.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.913
I should let you finish.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.442
These trousers
are ill-fitting.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.968
Nah, you're good,
you're good.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.404
Yep.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.581
Okay, you can stay
the night.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.148
No, I really
must find my friend.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.759
How far
is the Renaissance Hotel?

29:20.802 --> 29:24.153
It's too far to walk.
You really should rest up.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.633
Let your body heal.

29:25.676 --> 29:26.852
You can find him tomorrow.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.549
I'll be off first thing
in the morning.

29:28.592 --> 29:31.813
I must say, this reprieve
really has been my salvation.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.685
And I thank you for
your kindness, Ms. Walker.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.822
It's a Christmas gift
from my dad.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.345
I'm from Texas.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.607
Sleep tight.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.675
Aah!

30:10.025 --> 30:11.026
Oh. Oh, no.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.593
No, no, no, no, no.

30:12.636 --> 30:13.812
♪ Get your both hands up♪

30:13.855 --> 30:15.814

30:18.077 --> 30:19.992
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

30:20.035 --> 30:20.993
It's okay.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.516
I'm so sorry.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.172

30:26.215 --> 30:28.870

30:28.914 --> 30:31.003
What are your plans
for today?

30:31.046 --> 30:32.308
I must find my friend.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.614
The museum's closed,

30:33.657 --> 30:36.922
so I have the day off
if you need any help.

30:38.488 --> 30:39.968
How do you feel?

30:40.012 --> 30:42.928
-Much better, thank you.
-Good.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.147
How do I get
to the Renaissance Hotel?

30:45.191 --> 30:46.975
Are you sure
he's even there?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.498
Have you tried calling him?

30:48.542 --> 30:50.022
Here -- use my phone.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.205
Okay, I got it.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.293
Sorry.

31:00.336 --> 31:02.861
Renaissance Hotel
in Times Square.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.079
What's his name?

31:04.123 --> 31:06.865
John Stevenson --
Dr. John Stevenson.

31:06.908 --> 31:10.912
A guest, please --
Dr. John Stevenson?

31:13.393 --> 31:14.698
They're working with Utopia...

31:14.742 --> 31:16.613
-Utopia?
-Thank you.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.441
He checked out
last night.

31:18.485 --> 31:22.054
The victim was last seen at
the popular night club Utopia.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.926
She was found nearby
stabbed several times.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.973
Bizarrely, a set of keys
was found in her mouth.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.409
The murder appears
to have been random,

31:29.452 --> 31:30.671
though the victim's purse
was found...

31:30.714 --> 31:31.977
He killed -- Coward!

31:32.020 --> 31:34.153
Who killed?

31:34.196 --> 31:37.069
John, the man I'm looking for --
Dr. John Stevenson.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.071
He's killed many women
in London,

31:39.114 --> 31:40.507
and now he's in New York.

31:40.550 --> 31:41.682
I have to find him.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.945
Uh, maybe you should
call the police.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.294
And tell them what?

31:45.338 --> 31:46.817
That the Ripper
has escaped 1893

31:46.861 --> 31:48.950
in my time machine and travelled
to New York City?

31:48.994 --> 31:49.908
They'll think I'm mad.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.431
Do you mean
Jack the Ripper?

31:51.474 --> 31:53.476
Yes.
And now he's killed again.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.130
Utopia is a reference to me.

31:55.174 --> 31:58.699
The keys in her mouth --
That's a message to me.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.180
He wants the key --
this key.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.834
Jack the Ripper lived
over 100 years ago.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.969
I lied.
I'm not an actor.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.797
Just, please,
look at this key.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.233
Surely as a museum curator,

32:11.277 --> 32:13.148
you can see
that this is a relic.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.584
That doesn't prove anything.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.195
You asked me how I was able
to get into the machine.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.152
Yes!

32:17.196 --> 32:18.762
Because it was
in my basement

32:18.806 --> 32:21.156
in 12 Mornington Lane
in London, where I live.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.331
In 1893?

32:22.375 --> 32:23.724
Yes.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.247
You seem so sane
in so many ways.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.988
Please, I need your help.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.555
If I don't stop him,
he will keep killing.

32:28.598 --> 32:29.860
If you know who killed
that woman,

32:29.904 --> 32:31.166
then you need to go
to the police!

32:31.210 --> 32:34.735
They won't believe me.
You don't.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.171
Jane.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.521
What if I can prove to you
that I'm telling the truth?

32:38.565 --> 32:40.436
Then we can both go
to the police together.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.090
Grant me access
to the time machine.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.700
I'll prove it to you.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.885
Watch your step.

32:54.929 --> 32:58.585
You know, I could get
in a lot of trouble for this.

32:58.628 --> 33:02.937
I didn't anticipate
passengers.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.895
Sorry.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.203
Um...

33:12.642 --> 33:13.556
Right.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.951
Now, I say we do
a short trip.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.649
Say, three days from now.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.665
It's over 123 years old
with no power source.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.232
But, hey,
I can sit here all day.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.658
We're still here.

34:11.701 --> 34:12.615
Yes.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.401
But it is
three days later.

34:26.194 --> 34:29.328
This exhibit doesn't open
for three days.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.504
That would be today.

34:36.509 --> 34:39.903
How is this possible?

34:46.127 --> 34:48.651
I'll give you a moment
to process.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.267
Is this really happening?

34:59.227 --> 35:01.229
Are you really
H.G. Wells?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.579
Flesh and blood.

35:10.108 --> 35:14.982
I must seem so different to you,
so inappropriate.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.637
You're from Victorian England.
I ate with my hands.

35:21.423 --> 35:24.513
What is it like to be here
in this time?

35:24.557 --> 35:28.169
I'm dazzled, astonished.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.956
I'm also profoundly
disappointed.

35:34.915 --> 35:38.179
I envisioned a society
that was entirely different.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.226
Yeah, I-I think
we all did.

35:41.269 --> 35:45.404
It's not without its beauty,
though.

35:45.447 --> 35:50.191
I must take issue with something
that you said earlier.

35:50.235 --> 35:54.543
There is absolutely nothing
mediocre about you.

35:57.198 --> 36:01.942
I find you, Jane Walker,
particularly special.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.207
You okay?

36:06.251 --> 36:09.906
Yes.

36:09.950 --> 36:12.082
I'm just breathing.

36:17.523 --> 36:21.091
So, you haven't written
"The Time Machine" yet.

36:21.135 --> 36:24.094
Started it,
several times.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.184
I haven't quite
figured it out yet.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.402
What about the others?

36:27.446 --> 36:28.882
"The Island of Dr. Moreau,"

36:28.925 --> 36:31.319
"The Invisible Man,"
"The War of the Worlds"?

36:31.363 --> 36:33.582
I write
for the London Gazette.

36:33.626 --> 36:36.063
Trust me,
you write a lot of books.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.674
It's nice to know
I'm inspired.

36:38.718 --> 36:41.286
I can't believe
this is real.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.646
What's wrong?

37:03.177 --> 37:07.007
-So, I die three days from now.
-I will fix this, I promise.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.617
How?
We can't go to the police.

37:08.661 --> 37:09.923
They'll never believe us.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.751
The paper said
that you were the third victim.

37:11.794 --> 37:12.795
Who's the second victim?

37:12.839 --> 37:15.102
There was the woman
at Utopia,

37:15.145 --> 37:17.235
but we're missing
a victim.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.236
Uh, second victim.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.541
"Kerry Ann Riley was found

37:19.585 --> 37:21.543
on the roof
of the Palace nightclub.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.241
Security footage
puts her inside the club

37:23.284 --> 37:25.243
with an unidentified man
at 11:30 three nights ago."

37:25.286 --> 37:26.722
Three nights ago --
That's tonight.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.594
-What time is it?
-It's 10:30.

37:28.637 --> 37:31.466
I'll go to the club,
and I'll stop him.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.902
What are you doing?

37:32.946 --> 37:34.948
Google.
Internet search.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.388
This is her.
She's 23.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.607
She's pretty.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.130
Haven't much time.

37:43.173 --> 37:44.653
You'll need a gun.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.438
There will be no violence!

37:46.481 --> 37:50.311
The man who raises his fist
first is the man out of ideas.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.096
Yeah, that's all very nice,
but you need a gun.

38:01.931 --> 38:03.455
We have to hurry.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.022
How do we get
to the roof?

38:06.066 --> 38:07.285
Come on.
This way.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.770
John!

38:14.814 --> 38:16.990
John, who is that?

38:17.033 --> 38:17.730
My dear.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.558
No, let -- let her go.

38:19.601 --> 38:20.733
Stay back.

38:23.910 --> 38:24.998
I remember you.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.522
The girl from the museum.

38:27.566 --> 38:28.871
Clever.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.352
Clever, H.G. --
attempting to change the future.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.006
That can prove
very dangerous.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.356
What's dangerous is allowing you
to go on killing with impunity.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.314
Now, let her go.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.880
Where is the key?
Where is it?

38:37.924 --> 38:39.708
I have it.
It's -- It's here.

38:39.752 --> 38:40.666
Uh...

38:45.018 --> 38:47.237
Let her go!

38:48.282 --> 38:49.849
Finally, you rise
to the occasion.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.720
I didn't think
you had it in you.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.635
Let her go, now.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.902
Go downstairs and get help.
Go, go go!

38:59.946 --> 39:03.341
It's catching,
isn't it -- violence?

39:03.384 --> 39:06.082
It really has infected
this world.

39:06.126 --> 39:09.390
Are you really willing
to kill me

39:09.434 --> 39:13.481
and violate everything
that you stand for?

39:13.525 --> 39:17.877
You don't belong in this time,
or any time.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.748
Then do it.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.054
Do it.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.360
Do it!

39:40.073 --> 39:41.683
Over here! Help!

39:41.727 --> 39:42.989
Please!

39:43.032 --> 39:45.383
Somebody help us!

39:45.426 --> 39:46.906
I want that key.

39:46.949 --> 39:47.820
Up here!

39:47.863 --> 39:49.604
This way!

39:51.214 --> 39:52.041
-You okay?
-Yeah.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.260
Are you okay?
Oh, my God.

39:55.175 --> 39:57.177
You need stitches.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.831
Please, let me take you
to the hospital.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.007
No, I'm -- I'm fine.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.922
This could get infected.
You need antibiotics.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.097
Don't be stupid.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.751
It's too late for that,
I'm afraid.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.535
Stupidity's become
my dominant trait.

40:07.579 --> 40:08.971
Hey.

40:09.015 --> 40:11.060
I think you did
pretty well tonight.

40:11.104 --> 40:14.760
You saved that girl,
which means you saved me.

40:14.803 --> 40:17.066
Did I?
There will be others.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.547
This is a sport to him,
and he's taunting me with it.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.506
I must find him.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.421
We willfind him.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.510
We?

40:25.553 --> 40:27.337
Absolutely not.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.469
This is my problem,

40:28.513 --> 40:29.731
and I will no longer
put you in danger.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.690
I can take care of myself.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.003
Take two of these
with some food.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.744
I'll be right back.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.263
Aah!

41:25.308 --> 41:27.528
Jane?

41:27.572 --> 41:28.790
Jane?

41:30.444 --> 41:31.489
Jane?

41:43.588 --> 41:44.850
Oh, no.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.514
Hello, Mr. Wells.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.080
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

41:58.124 --> 41:59.429
We have a lot to talk about.

41:59.473 --> 42:01.562
No, I have to find Jane.
She was just here.

42:01.606 --> 42:02.563
John took her.

42:02.607 --> 42:03.651
You mean the Ripper
took her.

42:03.695 --> 42:06.045
How do you know that?

42:06.088 --> 42:07.394
Because you told me.

42:07.437 --> 42:10.440
I'll explain everything,
but we need to go now.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.790
I-I don't know you!

42:11.833 --> 42:15.228
But you will.
I'm Vanessa.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.447
I'm your
great-great-granddaughter.

42:17.491 --> 42:19.101
How can I possibly
be related to you?

42:19.145 --> 42:20.886
I've never met you before
in my life.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.322
But I've met you
in my life.

42:22.365 --> 42:23.628
That's impossible.

42:23.671 --> 42:25.586
So is time travel,
but here you are.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.067
I have to find John.
He will kill her.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.938
He would have
done that already.

42:29.982 --> 42:31.461
He wants something.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.768
What is it, Mr. Wells?
Is it the key?

42:35.422 --> 42:36.858
How do you know
about the key?

42:36.902 --> 42:37.859
Please.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.078
They're gone.

42:39.121 --> 42:41.646
Come with me and I will help you
find them.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.438
What are you doing?

42:51.481 --> 42:52.439
Stop.
-Get off me.

42:52.482 --> 42:54.310
Get off me!
You can't do this.

42:54.354 --> 42:56.182
-Get back here.
-Wait, stop it. Stop.

42:56.225 --> 42:57.618
He will kill her.

42:57.662 --> 42:59.141
I must find Jane.

43:53.674 --> 43:56.634
Vanessa
will be right with you.

44:04.903 --> 44:07.340
You said you would
help me find Jane. How?

44:07.383 --> 44:09.342
You've been hurt.
You should sit down.No, no, I'm fine.

44:09.385 --> 44:10.473
Jane is all I care about
right now.

44:10.517 --> 44:11.823
Please,
let me look at that.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.346
We are wasting time.

44:13.389 --> 44:15.914
You can't do anything
if you bleed to death.

44:17.742 --> 44:21.310
Let me help you.

44:38.110 --> 44:41.809
You don't want this
to get infected.

44:43.245 --> 44:45.030
Searched Jane Walker's
apartment.

44:45.073 --> 44:47.902
I have her laptop, purse,
and cellphone.

44:47.946 --> 44:49.425
And your things.

44:49.469 --> 44:50.600
Why do you have
her belongings?

44:50.644 --> 44:51.732
He'll want to make contact.

44:51.776 --> 44:54.082
This will be
his easiest route.

44:54.126 --> 44:55.954
Did you find the key?

44:55.997 --> 44:57.172
No.

44:59.131 --> 45:00.349
It's in my possession.

45:02.656 --> 45:04.484
Where it will stay.

45:05.964 --> 45:08.270
And that controls
the time machine?

45:08.314 --> 45:10.751
It controls who has
the time machine.

45:10.795 --> 45:12.971
I designed it for safety.

45:13.014 --> 45:15.582
The machine always returns to
the starting date of each voyage

45:15.625 --> 45:17.889
unless you have this key
to override it.

45:17.932 --> 45:19.673
So if he gets the key
in the time machine,

45:19.717 --> 45:21.022
he can go anywhere
and kill anyone.

45:21.066 --> 45:23.285
And I will never
be able to find him.

45:23.329 --> 45:24.460
Is the time machine safe?

45:24.504 --> 45:25.940
It's being guarded
at the museum.

45:25.984 --> 45:28.377
Please,
he will kill her.

45:28.421 --> 45:30.466
No,
not if he wants the key.

45:30.510 --> 45:32.425
How do you know me?

45:32.468 --> 45:34.427
You said that we were related.
How is that possible?

45:34.470 --> 45:36.081
I was hoping you might
have some answers.

45:36.124 --> 45:39.040
I've traced my genealogy, but I
can't find a genetic connection.

45:39.084 --> 45:40.563
You said that
we've met before.

45:40.607 --> 45:44.176
My freshman year in college,
I was walking on campus.

45:44.219 --> 45:47.179
You came running up to me,
out of breath, in a hurry,

45:47.222 --> 45:50.356
and said that
you were H.G. Wells.

45:50.399 --> 45:52.053
I thought
you were crazy.

45:52.097 --> 45:54.273
The whole thing
sounds crazy.

45:54.316 --> 45:57.580
But then you said you were
my great-great-grandfather.

45:57.624 --> 46:00.061
It was insane.
You were rambling.

46:00.105 --> 46:02.890
You told me about the
time machine, Jack the Ripper.

46:02.934 --> 46:05.806
You spoke of the key
and a woman in danger.

46:05.850 --> 46:08.243
None of this
makes any sense.

46:08.287 --> 46:09.897
That's what I said.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.812
Then you handed me
a letter.

46:11.856 --> 46:16.599
You said for me to
find the time machine.

46:16.643 --> 46:18.471
I wrote you a letter?

46:18.514 --> 46:20.603
No,
you wrote youa letter.

46:22.170 --> 46:24.564
You knew you wouldn't
believe you either.

46:28.394 --> 46:29.787
It's my handwriting.

46:29.830 --> 46:33.051
"It's true, H.G.,
don't be daft.

46:33.094 --> 46:34.269
Believe it.

46:34.313 --> 46:35.923
H.G."

46:35.967 --> 46:37.359
I wrote this, but...

46:37.403 --> 46:39.100
This symbol,
what does it mean?

46:39.144 --> 46:41.233
I've researched it,
but there's no record of it.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.411
Why didn't I write more?

46:45.454 --> 46:46.847
And where did John
take Jane?

46:46.891 --> 46:48.544
Details would be very handy
right now.

46:48.588 --> 46:49.937
I have to find her.

46:49.981 --> 46:52.548
Don't worry, we will.

47:04.647 --> 47:07.737
Going somewhere, dear?

47:07.781 --> 47:10.784
Sit you back down over here,
shall we?

47:10.828 --> 47:12.960
You feisty little bugger.

47:13.004 --> 47:15.354
Right.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.530
What is
your telephone number?

47:17.573 --> 47:19.314
Why?

47:19.358 --> 47:21.882
Because I need to have a little
chat with your new beau.

47:21.926 --> 47:23.797
I don't...

47:23.841 --> 47:25.886
Herbert George Wells,
remember him?

47:25.930 --> 47:27.801
He has something
that I want,

47:27.845 --> 47:29.890
and I have something
that he wants.

47:29.934 --> 47:31.283
I need
your telephone number.

47:31.326 --> 47:33.589
How do you know
he has my phone?

47:33.633 --> 47:34.808
Well,
he's naive and pathetic.

47:34.852 --> 47:37.028
He's not stupid.
Your number.

47:37.071 --> 47:39.334
I'm not gonna help you.

47:41.554 --> 47:43.730
Thought that's what
you might say.

47:48.822 --> 47:52.260
I'd like you to meet
our very gracious hostess,

47:52.304 --> 47:53.348
Julia Milton.

47:53.392 --> 47:54.784
Her friends
call her Jules.

47:54.828 --> 47:57.091
28, single,
from Richmond, Virginia,

47:57.135 --> 47:59.964
currently working as
a fashion consultant with Macy's

48:00.007 --> 48:05.926
where she makes
a staggering $165,000 a year.

48:05.970 --> 48:07.536
Isn't that mad?

48:07.580 --> 48:10.496
Did you know this apartment
costs $8,000 a month?

48:10.539 --> 48:14.456
I mean, th-th-the economics of
this period are just absurd.

48:16.110 --> 48:18.852
Now,
I really, really think

48:18.896 --> 48:20.636
it's time you made that call,
don't you?

48:33.432 --> 48:34.912
Blocked caller.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.304
This could be him.

48:36.348 --> 48:38.132
Now, you need to talk to him,
but don't mention us.

48:38.176 --> 48:39.307
He doesn't know
you have help.

48:39.351 --> 48:40.700
It's our best weapon
against him.

48:43.572 --> 48:44.617
Hello?

48:44.660 --> 48:46.401
You don't have to shout,
H.G.

48:46.445 --> 48:48.447
You can speak at
a decent room level.

48:48.490 --> 48:49.796
Where's Jane?

48:49.839 --> 48:51.929
She's right here.

48:51.972 --> 48:53.365
Go on, say hello.

48:53.408 --> 48:54.801
I'm here. I'm fine.

48:54.844 --> 48:56.194
If you harm her
in any way --

48:56.237 --> 48:58.196
Dear God, H.G.,

48:58.239 --> 49:00.459
the role of hero's really
not in your arsenal, is it?

49:00.502 --> 49:01.677
I mean it, John.

49:01.721 --> 49:02.940
Yes, of course you do.

49:02.983 --> 49:05.986
Now, I want the key
to the time machine.

49:07.074 --> 49:10.121
Meet me at the bridge in
Central Park tomorrow at noon.

49:10.164 --> 49:12.471
Key gets you Jane.

49:12.514 --> 49:13.994
Where is Central Park?

49:14.038 --> 49:17.084
Oh, you're a clever bunny,
you'll figure it out.

49:18.259 --> 49:20.479
No police, just you.

49:20.522 --> 49:22.481
Alone.

49:22.524 --> 49:24.962
Key or Jane dies.

49:29.314 --> 49:30.358
Ahh!

49:55.122 --> 49:56.123
It's okay.

49:59.605 --> 50:01.476
-We have to hurry.
-Where is he?

50:01.520 --> 50:03.217
I hit him over the head.
He's unconscious.

50:03.261 --> 50:05.263
Come on.

50:16.317 --> 50:18.667
He's gonna wake up.
Stop, he's gonna wake up.

50:18.711 --> 50:20.060
No, no, no.

50:20.104 --> 50:22.062
Shh.

50:46.739 --> 50:49.742
Okay, okay,
come on past.

50:49.785 --> 50:51.048
Please don't wake up.

51:09.892 --> 51:12.504
The stairs will be faster.

51:16.769 --> 51:18.466
-Come here!
-Ahh!

51:24.124 --> 51:26.735
Ah, ah,
I wouldn't do that.

51:28.172 --> 51:30.391
Walk out that door,
and she's dead.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.748
Please.

52:41.549 --> 52:43.377
Are you sure
you want to know?

52:45.379 --> 52:46.815
They're my books.

52:46.859 --> 52:49.340
Yeah, but you haven't
written them yet.

52:49.383 --> 52:52.212
If you read them now,
won't it affect what you write?

52:52.256 --> 52:53.953
Or will it inform
what I write?

52:53.996 --> 52:56.216
Hell if I know.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.913
Me neither, I'm afraid.

52:59.393 --> 53:01.526
Has there been any word
on Jane Walker's whereabouts?

53:01.569 --> 53:03.092
John was calling
from a burner phone,

53:03.136 --> 53:05.182
which makes it
harder to trace.

53:05.225 --> 53:07.184
I have no idea
what that means.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.664
It means it will take more time
to find his location.

53:09.708 --> 53:10.883
Right.

53:10.926 --> 53:12.363
And where is
Central Park?

53:14.060 --> 53:15.279
We still have some time.

53:15.322 --> 53:17.237
Let me get
Ms. Anders for you.

53:21.546 --> 53:22.634
Hey, Carl, how you doing?

53:22.677 --> 53:23.939
All right.

53:28.379 --> 53:29.684
Hello, there.

53:29.728 --> 53:33.340
I'm Griffin Monroe.

53:33.384 --> 53:35.690
Herbert George Wells.
Pleasure.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.910
I'm sorry -- what did you say
your name was again?

53:37.953 --> 53:40.217
Hey.

53:40.260 --> 53:41.261
Honey.

53:41.305 --> 53:42.610
-Hi.
-Good morning.

53:42.654 --> 53:44.221
Has there been any news
regarding Ms. Walker?

53:44.264 --> 53:45.570
Nothing yet.

53:45.613 --> 53:47.876
Doug?
-Right this way.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.270
-Hi.
-Hi.

53:50.314 --> 53:51.837
Who's that?

53:51.880 --> 53:53.012
You didn't get
my message?

53:53.055 --> 53:54.318
When did you send
the message?

53:54.361 --> 53:55.275
I texted you this morning.

53:55.319 --> 53:56.711
Is there a problem?

53:56.755 --> 53:58.844
Not everyone knows
you're H.G. Wells.

53:58.887 --> 54:00.280
We need to keep it
on the down low.

54:00.324 --> 54:01.934
I see, of course.

54:01.977 --> 54:03.283
He said he was H.G. Wells.

54:03.327 --> 54:04.632
What?
That's impossible.

54:04.676 --> 54:06.286
-No, it's exactly what he said.
-Well, he's not.

54:06.330 --> 54:09.985
He's George Wells,
a descendant of H.G. Wells.

54:10.029 --> 54:11.813
A descendant?
Yes.

54:11.857 --> 54:13.641
I met him in London,
years ago,

54:13.685 --> 54:16.514
when I found the time machine
and I was having it restored.

54:16.557 --> 54:18.994
He's in town just for
the exhibit at the museum.

54:19.038 --> 54:21.170
You didn't
mention he was coming.

54:21.214 --> 54:22.737
Oh, it's been
a crazy week.

54:22.781 --> 54:23.738
Oh. Ah.

54:23.782 --> 54:25.653
Remember we have lunch
with Stuart.

54:25.697 --> 54:27.220
God, I'm so sorry.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.178
I have to cancel.

54:29.222 --> 54:30.484
Please don't hate me.

54:30.528 --> 54:32.051
We can reschedule.

54:32.094 --> 54:33.313
No, it's about your campaign,
and I totally screwed up.

54:33.357 --> 54:35.359
It's really not a big deal.

54:36.316 --> 54:37.317
Thank you, Senator.

54:37.361 --> 54:39.537
Oh, not yet.

54:40.581 --> 54:42.496
You've been granted a reprieve

54:42.540 --> 54:46.761
due to the feisty little vixen
in the next room.

54:46.805 --> 54:49.373
Now, now,
don't get too cozy.

54:50.852 --> 54:53.986
Well, it is --
That is soft, isn't it?

54:54.029 --> 54:56.162
Oh, it's like a cloud.

54:58.033 --> 55:00.253
They really have figured some of
these things out, haven't they?

55:05.084 --> 55:07.565
Let her go.

55:07.608 --> 55:10.959
You don't need her.
You have me.

55:11.003 --> 55:13.962
I have her
to keep you in line.

55:18.402 --> 55:20.186
I hurt my arm.

55:20.229 --> 55:22.014
I need to clean it.

55:22.057 --> 55:24.495
I wouldn't worry about a little
scrape on your arm.

55:24.538 --> 55:26.235
You'll be dead
soon enough.

55:26.279 --> 55:28.586
You're not gonna kill me.

55:28.629 --> 55:32.198
What makes you
think that?

55:32.241 --> 55:34.461
You would have
done it by now.

55:34.505 --> 55:36.855
Besides, you need access
to the time machine

55:36.898 --> 55:38.944
once you have the key.

55:40.511 --> 55:42.774
Well, aren't you
the clever one.

55:50.303 --> 55:52.000
Take a seat.

56:05.579 --> 56:07.625
Convenient.

56:16.460 --> 56:18.462
Come on, let's have
a look at your arm.

56:20.420 --> 56:23.380
Come on, I'm a doctor.

56:31.518 --> 56:33.651
Prestigious surgeon,
in fact.

56:35.479 --> 56:37.698
So why do you kill?

56:37.742 --> 56:40.222
Do you like playing God?

56:40.266 --> 56:42.877
Deciding who lives
and who dies?

56:42.921 --> 56:46.228
You're a bold one
with your questions.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.537
Why prostitutes?

56:50.581 --> 56:53.410
Do you have something against
women or just sex?

56:53.453 --> 56:55.237
Be careful
with your tongue.

56:55.281 --> 56:56.978
I do not allow women
to speak to me this way.

56:58.806 --> 57:00.155
Well, when you get in
that time machine,

57:00.199 --> 57:02.114
make sure you go backwards.

57:02.157 --> 57:04.290
Won't get any better for you
in the future

57:04.333 --> 57:06.423
where women are concerned.

57:06.466 --> 57:09.251
And how do you know
so much about me?

57:13.952 --> 57:16.128
Everyone knows who you are.

57:16.171 --> 57:18.609
You're Jack the Ripper.

57:18.652 --> 57:20.524
You're famous.

57:20.567 --> 57:22.917
I'm famous?

57:22.961 --> 57:25.398
Most famous killer
in the world.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.356
You didn't know?

57:27.400 --> 57:30.316
Figured you would have learned
how to Google yourself by now.

57:30.359 --> 57:32.579
Tell me more.

57:32.623 --> 57:34.712
There's a laptop
over there.

57:34.755 --> 57:36.888
I can show you.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.891
Once I've secured Jane's safety,

57:39.934 --> 57:43.024
I will need to take John
directly to the time machine.

57:43.068 --> 57:45.287
Can I ask a question?

57:45.331 --> 57:47.159
Why can't you simply
go back in time

57:47.202 --> 57:49.509
and reverse this entire
series of events?

57:49.553 --> 57:51.511
Can't you go back to the moment
just before the Ripper escapes

57:51.555 --> 57:53.034
in your time machine
and stop him?

57:53.078 --> 57:56.037
One must be careful not to
disrupt the very fabric of time.

57:56.081 --> 57:59.693
It is my theory...

57:59.737 --> 58:02.043
every time we travel
to the past or future,

58:02.087 --> 58:03.784
you prick
the fabric of time.

58:05.220 --> 58:07.745
If you go too close
to any one time repeatedly...

58:10.835 --> 58:15.535
It can cause
a hole in time.

58:17.363 --> 58:18.756
What happens then?

58:18.799 --> 58:20.322
I'm not sure.

58:20.366 --> 58:23.369
We melt, implode,
cease to exist.

58:23.412 --> 58:25.066
I prefer not to find out.

58:25.110 --> 58:27.112
But that is why
time travel is dangerous.

58:27.155 --> 58:28.505
In the wrong hands,
it could,

58:28.548 --> 58:30.419
quite frankly,
destroy the world.

58:30.463 --> 58:32.291
Okay, then.

58:32.334 --> 58:34.467
We're better off with you
meeting him in the park at noon.

58:34.511 --> 58:36.034
You'll go to the bridge where
my men and I will surprise him.

58:36.077 --> 58:37.557
Well, he specifically said
to come alone.

58:37.601 --> 58:38.819
He'll have no idea
we're there.

58:38.863 --> 58:40.212
We'll grab him.
Isn't that what you want?

58:40.255 --> 58:41.822
I want the safe return
of Jane Walker.

58:41.866 --> 58:43.041
That is my first priority.

58:43.084 --> 58:44.477
Can't we do both?

58:44.521 --> 58:46.914
I have known John Stevenson
for years.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.394
He is shrewd and cunning.

58:48.437 --> 58:49.917
He is not easily foiled.

58:49.961 --> 58:52.790
He may be Jack the Ripper,
but he's still from 1893.

58:52.833 --> 58:55.880
His little knives won't come
close to my 9 millimeter Glock.

58:55.923 --> 58:58.360
Does everyone in this era
carry a firearm?

58:58.404 --> 58:59.492
Pretty much.

58:59.536 --> 59:00.624
Let Doug come with you.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.495
It's too dangerous.

59:02.539 --> 59:05.367
The more people I involve,
the more I risk altering time.

59:05.411 --> 59:07.544
There's no telling the damage
I've caused thus far.

59:07.587 --> 59:09.807
I must do this alone.
That is final.

59:09.850 --> 59:12.113
Very well.
You will go alone.

59:13.506 --> 59:15.813
"Five prostitutes
were killed.

59:15.856 --> 59:19.381
The murders were
misogynistic in nature,

59:19.425 --> 59:22.080
suggesting
a hatred for women."

59:22.123 --> 59:24.343
No.
That is simply inaccurate.

59:24.386 --> 59:27.041
I mean, I killed prostitutes
because of the opportunity.

59:27.085 --> 59:30.218
They troll alleyways.
They make it easy.

59:30.262 --> 59:33.526
I also killed vagrants and
street urchins in equal measure.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.790
It says here
I was never identified.

59:36.834 --> 59:38.879
I don't even
get credit for it?

59:38.923 --> 59:43.405
Did I not mention you're famous
for being an anonymous killer?

59:43.449 --> 59:45.320
What are you talking about?

59:45.364 --> 59:46.931
No one knows my name?

59:46.974 --> 59:48.410
Wells is famous.

59:48.454 --> 59:51.239
He accomplished something
that endured, something good.

59:51.283 --> 59:53.024
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a decorated surgeon,

59:53.067 --> 59:54.765
highly regarded
all over London.

59:54.808 --> 59:56.593
No, you're Jack the Ripper,

59:56.636 --> 59:59.247
a faceless dark cloud
on humanity.

1:00:02.207 --> 1:00:03.556
You want to know
why I kill?

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:04.644
Because the only thing
more fulfilling

1:00:04.688 --> 1:00:06.298
than saving a life
is taking one.

1:00:06.341 --> 1:00:09.214
The instant sensation,
the release it brings --

1:00:09.257 --> 1:00:11.869
that slakes my thirst.

1:00:35.893 --> 1:00:37.242
You're gonna go right through
that entrance,

1:00:37.285 --> 1:00:39.592
follow the path,
you can't miss the bridge.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:42.029
Very well.

1:00:42.073 --> 1:00:43.335
I'll be off.

1:00:43.378 --> 1:00:45.511
You're not gonna
give him the key, are you?

1:00:45.554 --> 1:00:47.513
That's not my intention.

1:00:47.556 --> 1:00:50.037
And when John realizes
he's being played?

1:00:50.081 --> 1:00:52.866
All I care about is
the safe return of Ms. Walker.

1:00:52.910 --> 1:00:54.476
All right.

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:55.869
We'll be here, waiting.

1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:05.400
For every step
society takes forward,

1:01:05.444 --> 1:01:07.707
we take two steps back.

1:01:07.751 --> 1:01:09.361
We invent new technologies

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:12.059
only to use them as weapons
against one another.

1:01:12.103 --> 1:01:13.713
We strive for equality

1:01:13.757 --> 1:01:15.889
yet we're more divided
than ever.

1:01:15.933 --> 1:01:17.412
Look around you.

1:01:17.456 --> 1:01:19.371
Nations are at war.

1:01:19.414 --> 1:01:21.765
Violence runs rampant.

1:01:21.808 --> 1:01:24.724
Our days on this planet
are numbered.

1:01:24.768 --> 1:01:27.988
Prepare yourself.
The end is near.

1:01:28.032 --> 1:01:31.949
We are on the verge
of all-out nuclear war.

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.317
My word.

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.406
Did your grandmother
dress you this morning?

1:01:54.449 --> 1:01:56.451
Hello, old friend.

1:01:56.495 --> 1:01:57.757
We are anything
but friends.

1:01:57.801 --> 1:01:59.759
Oh, come on.
That's not true.

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:01.413
We have
a long history together.

1:02:01.456 --> 1:02:03.545
A few days in the future
can't change that.

1:02:05.809 --> 1:02:06.810
Where's Jane?

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:08.594
Where's the key?

1:02:08.637 --> 1:02:10.030
When Jane is safe,
I'll give you the key.

1:02:10.074 --> 1:02:11.815
There you go again,

1:02:11.858 --> 1:02:13.773
trying to negotiate
as if you had the upper hand.

1:02:13.817 --> 1:02:16.123
It's bloody awful,
isn't it, this world?

1:02:16.167 --> 1:02:18.647
Everybody's so loud and angry
about everything.

1:02:18.691 --> 1:02:20.519
Yelling, pushing,
shoving --

1:02:20.562 --> 1:02:22.477
I mean, it's a battlefield
to get an afternoon tea.

1:02:22.521 --> 1:02:23.783
Enough, John.

1:02:23.827 --> 1:02:25.480
I have the key.
Where is Jane?

1:02:25.524 --> 1:02:28.614
Do you really want to
take me back to 1893?

1:02:28.657 --> 1:02:31.356
You must pay
for your crimes.

1:02:31.399 --> 1:02:34.185
Well, a quick history lesson
for you, H.G. --

1:02:34.228 --> 1:02:35.621
I'm never caught.

1:02:35.664 --> 1:02:38.537
You can look it up.
You can Google it, in fact.

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:41.583
So, this little power struggle
will not yield you anything.

1:02:41.627 --> 1:02:42.715
I never return to London.

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:44.195
Well, maybe
it's because you die.

1:02:45.413 --> 1:02:47.024
By your cowardly hands?

1:02:47.067 --> 1:02:48.895
I think not.

1:02:53.334 --> 1:02:55.162
Don't worry.

1:02:55.206 --> 1:02:56.555
She's not far.

1:02:56.598 --> 1:02:58.600
Give me the key, and I'll tell
you where to find her.

1:03:00.602 --> 1:03:01.865
What are you looking at?

1:03:01.908 --> 1:03:05.042
Where's Jane?

1:03:05.085 --> 1:03:06.826
Where is Jane?

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.393
Come on, give me the key.
I'll tell you where to find her.

1:03:08.436 --> 1:03:09.611
Come on.

1:03:11.222 --> 1:03:12.963
You can trust me.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.581
No, no, no,
no, no, don't.

1:03:22.624 --> 1:03:23.800
I had this under control.

1:03:27.542 --> 1:03:29.893
Hey, stop!

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:37.901
-Kids!
-Let's go. Move.

1:03:37.944 --> 1:03:40.860
-Let's go.
-Let's get out of here.

1:03:40.904 --> 1:03:43.080
You weren't
supposed to be here.

1:03:43.123 --> 1:03:44.690
And now she's dead.

1:03:44.733 --> 1:03:46.213
You've killed her.

1:03:48.433 --> 1:03:50.435
Ohhh.

1:03:50.478 --> 1:03:52.698
You lied to me.

1:03:52.741 --> 1:03:54.265
I am so sorry.

1:03:54.308 --> 1:03:56.180
I thought it was the right call.
I couldn't let you go alone.

1:03:56.223 --> 1:03:58.617
We should have something soon
on the phone trace.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.749
You sealed her fate.
She's dead.

1:04:00.793 --> 1:04:02.360
I apologize, sir.

1:04:02.403 --> 1:04:03.883
I saw you
give him the key,

1:04:03.927 --> 1:04:05.319
I gave the word to Carl
to move in.

1:04:05.363 --> 1:04:06.886
Her death
is on your head.

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:10.455
But she is his only leverage
over you. Why would he kill her?

1:04:10.498 --> 1:04:12.892
Because he's a madman,
and we've angered him.

1:04:12.936 --> 1:04:15.503
He could lose all reasoning.

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:18.332
We will find her.

1:04:18.376 --> 1:04:20.073
No,
you don't understand.

1:04:20.117 --> 1:04:22.859
When I arrived,
I was helpless, lost.

1:04:22.902 --> 1:04:25.122
She was the one person
who showed me kindness.

1:04:25.165 --> 1:04:27.298
He will kill her
just to get back at me.

1:04:27.341 --> 1:04:29.343
I know him.

1:04:31.693 --> 1:04:34.218
I'm done here.

1:04:34.261 --> 1:04:35.393
If you'll excuse me.

1:04:35.436 --> 1:04:36.873
Where are you going?

1:04:36.916 --> 1:04:40.137
I wish to leave.
Kindly step aside.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.530
You came to me
all those years ago,

1:04:42.574 --> 1:04:45.098
and I've waited a long time
to understand my role in this.

1:04:45.142 --> 1:04:47.057
Let me fix this.

1:04:48.101 --> 1:04:49.929
I can help you.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:52.366
Am I a prisoner here?

1:04:52.410 --> 1:04:54.107
Of course not.

1:04:56.196 --> 1:04:58.198
I insist
you not follow me.

1:04:58.242 --> 1:05:01.114
I will not follow you.

1:05:06.380 --> 1:05:07.773
Are you serious?

1:05:27.271 --> 1:05:28.272
-Ooh!
-Oof.

1:05:28.315 --> 1:05:29.577
-I am so sorry.
-Eyes up, dude.

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:31.405
My apologies, sir.
Please forgive me.

1:05:31.449 --> 1:05:33.581
I'll just --

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:35.105
-What the hell, man?
-I am so sorry.

1:05:35.148 --> 1:05:37.542
Uh, do you know
which way downtown is?

1:05:41.198 --> 1:05:43.113
Thank you so much.

1:06:36.557 --> 1:06:38.081
Are you following me?

1:06:38.124 --> 1:06:39.430
What?

1:06:39.473 --> 1:06:41.084
Did Vanessa send you
to follow me?

1:06:41.127 --> 1:06:42.476
Man, I don't know you.

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.087
I'm just walking.

1:06:44.130 --> 1:06:46.350
Freak.

1:06:54.793 --> 1:06:56.577
Where did Wells get help?

1:06:56.621 --> 1:06:58.405
Who are they?

1:06:58.449 --> 1:07:00.451
I want out of
this bloody time.

1:07:02.105 --> 1:07:03.367
Then go.

1:07:03.410 --> 1:07:05.195
Just leave, disappear.

1:07:05.238 --> 1:07:08.328
To hell with it.

1:07:09.982 --> 1:07:11.418
I don't need the key.

1:07:11.462 --> 1:07:13.159
The time machine
still works.

1:07:13.203 --> 1:07:15.640
I can go
anywhere I bloody want.

1:07:17.163 --> 1:07:20.427
I'll disappear
into another time.

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.692
No.
You don't have to kill her!

1:07:24.736 --> 1:07:26.172
I know that.
I want to.

1:07:26.216 --> 1:07:27.826
There's no reason to,
just leave!

1:07:27.869 --> 1:07:29.175
Start over.

1:07:29.219 --> 1:07:30.872
You have an opportunity here.
You can change.

1:07:30.916 --> 1:07:32.309
You can be someone new.

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:34.746
Your legacy is that of
a killer that nobody knows.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:35.921
What are you rambling about?

1:07:35.964 --> 1:07:37.618
Somewhere inside,
I know you hate it

1:07:37.662 --> 1:07:39.359
because
I saw it in your face.

1:07:39.403 --> 1:07:41.013
You hate being
Jack the Ripper,

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:43.624
so why don't you just stop this
right here, right now?

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:47.454
Now I see why
H.G.'s so taken with you.

1:07:48.629 --> 1:07:52.938
You're both full of
the same idealistic rubbish.

1:07:54.157 --> 1:07:56.855
I am exactly
who I want to be.

1:07:56.898 --> 1:07:58.248
No!

1:08:31.672 --> 1:08:33.935
It's okay.
You're safe now.

1:08:35.676 --> 1:08:37.591
Do you know
where he went?

1:08:37.635 --> 1:08:39.593
I couldn't hear.

1:08:39.637 --> 1:08:41.769
Did he kill her?

1:08:41.813 --> 1:08:42.944
The trace came through.

1:08:42.988 --> 1:08:44.381
We got an address.
We're there now.

1:08:44.424 --> 1:08:45.556
Where's Jane?

1:08:45.599 --> 1:08:46.644
John took her.

1:08:46.687 --> 1:08:48.733
They left about
half an hour ago.

1:08:48.776 --> 1:08:51.605
Witness says
he was pretty unhinged.

1:08:51.649 --> 1:08:53.303
Where would they go?

1:08:53.346 --> 1:08:55.348
The museum will be
closing in 10 minutes.

1:08:55.392 --> 1:08:57.394
Please proceed to the exits.

1:08:57.437 --> 1:08:59.787
The museum will be closing
in 10 minutes.

1:08:59.831 --> 1:09:01.441
Please proceed to the exits.

1:09:01.485 --> 1:09:03.356
Hey, Jane.
The exhibit's closed.

1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:06.881
Yeah, I have, uh, an end-of-day
report for Vanessa Anders.

1:09:06.925 --> 1:09:08.274
I won't be long.

1:09:11.669 --> 1:09:13.236
Hurry up
before they figure me out.

1:09:13.279 --> 1:09:15.542
Just go wherever you're going.
Go!

1:09:16.326 --> 1:09:17.631
What?

1:09:17.675 --> 1:09:19.024
You didn't think I was gonna
go alone now, did you?

1:09:19.067 --> 1:09:20.156
No.

1:09:20.199 --> 1:09:21.157
No!

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.115
Let her go, John.

1:09:26.379 --> 1:09:28.773
I thought
I might see you here.

1:09:28.816 --> 1:09:30.122
And here we are again.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.211
This isn't about her.
This is about you and me.

1:09:32.255 --> 1:09:34.082
Oh, like it was you and me
in the park?

1:09:34.126 --> 1:09:35.432
You must think
I'm a fool.

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:37.521
There's no one else here.
I came completely alone.

1:09:37.564 --> 1:09:39.131
Well,
then you're the fool.

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:41.220
Perhaps I am.

1:09:41.264 --> 1:09:44.658
But I am also in possession of
the one thing that you want.

1:09:46.878 --> 1:09:49.054
I'd say that makes
the two of us.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:51.839
The key.

1:09:51.883 --> 1:09:53.537
Slide it to me.

1:09:58.977 --> 1:10:00.848
Oops.

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.735
John, John.

1:10:17.778 --> 1:10:19.606
John!

1:10:19.650 --> 1:10:21.956
John, you mustn't do this.

1:10:23.001 --> 1:10:25.351
No, no, no, no,
John, John. John.

1:10:25.395 --> 1:10:27.266
John.
John, look at me.

1:10:27.310 --> 1:10:28.528
Don't do this.

1:10:28.572 --> 1:10:30.269
John!

1:10:30.313 --> 1:10:32.706
John, you're making
a huge mistake.

1:10:32.750 --> 1:10:34.142
John!
Come on.

1:10:38.408 --> 1:10:39.670
Can you stop him?

1:10:39.713 --> 1:10:42.238
Come on.

1:10:42.281 --> 1:10:44.109
Come on.

1:10:44.152 --> 1:10:46.329
Come on, come on.

1:10:47.634 --> 1:10:49.636
Come on, come on.

1:10:57.818 --> 1:10:58.993
Come on, you.

1:11:03.998 --> 1:11:05.826
Ah!

1:11:07.524 --> 1:11:08.873
Ugh!

1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:15.096
Ah!

1:11:19.318 --> 1:11:20.972
-You all right?
-Yes.

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:23.931
Is he gone?

1:11:40.948 --> 1:11:42.602
Hey!

1:11:45.475 --> 1:11:46.606
Did you kill him?

1:11:46.650 --> 1:11:48.478
It's a stun gun.
He'll be fine.

1:11:48.521 --> 1:11:50.175
Are you okay?

1:11:51.307 --> 1:11:53.657
I am now.

1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:57.095
No, no, no, I wouldn't.

1:12:01.795 --> 1:12:04.015
Let's move out! Move!

1:12:04.058 --> 1:12:06.757
The Wells exhibit! Move!

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.106
Damn it, Wells.

1:12:08.149 --> 1:12:09.281
On the radio.

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:11.675
Down here!

1:12:11.718 --> 1:12:13.329
Call it in.

1:12:14.808 --> 1:12:16.506
We got a security officer down.

1:12:22.163 --> 1:12:24.296
-Got it?
-Yes, ma'am.

1:12:24.340 --> 1:12:25.689
We spoke to the police.

1:12:25.732 --> 1:12:27.473
It's being written up
as vandalism.

1:12:27.517 --> 1:12:29.519
Museum's on board
with keeping it quiet.

1:12:29.562 --> 1:12:30.781
Great.

1:12:30.824 --> 1:12:32.435
Let's wrap it up
and get out of here.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:40.181
Can it be fixed?

1:12:40.225 --> 1:12:42.009
Oh, never mind this.

1:12:42.053 --> 1:12:44.795
I'm more concerned
with you.

1:12:44.838 --> 1:12:46.013
Are you okay?

1:12:46.057 --> 1:12:49.147
I'm not gonna lie --
I was pretty scared.

1:12:52.890 --> 1:12:54.805
It's your phone.

1:12:57.155 --> 1:12:58.635
Hello?

1:12:58.678 --> 1:13:01.028
I'm gonna make this
short and sweet.

1:13:01.072 --> 1:13:03.683
I'm going to kill one person
every day

1:13:03.727 --> 1:13:05.293
until I get the time machine
with the key.

1:13:05.337 --> 1:13:06.643
Do I make myself clear?

1:13:06.686 --> 1:13:07.818
Yes, but --

1:13:12.649 --> 1:13:13.780
Was that him?

1:13:13.824 --> 1:13:17.088
Yes.
He still wants the key.

1:13:18.176 --> 1:13:19.960
How are you, Miss Walker?

1:13:20.004 --> 1:13:21.788
I've been better.

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:24.225
You've been through
quite an ordeal.

1:13:24.269 --> 1:13:26.750
You and that other woman
are lucky to be alive.

1:13:26.793 --> 1:13:31.450
The woman from the apartment,
Jules, she's alive?

1:13:31.494 --> 1:13:32.495
Yes.

1:13:32.538 --> 1:13:34.975
She's shaken,
but she's okay.

1:13:35.019 --> 1:13:36.412
She didn't hear
or see much.

1:13:36.455 --> 1:13:37.630
She's with the police now.

1:13:37.674 --> 1:13:39.197
We're monitoring her.

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:40.807
I thought he killed her.

1:13:42.330 --> 1:13:45.333
He said he killed her.

1:13:45.377 --> 1:13:47.335
Let's get out of here.

1:13:47.379 --> 1:13:49.555
Yeah.

1:13:56.214 --> 1:13:58.216
Thank you.

1:13:58.259 --> 1:14:00.000
Any time.

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:05.310
Why so sad?

1:14:06.703 --> 1:14:11.490
Appears
I was bested today.

1:14:11.534 --> 1:14:13.840
Let's cheer you up.

1:14:13.884 --> 1:14:15.276
Hey.

1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:17.235
This guy needs a drink.

1:14:20.543 --> 1:14:22.501
I told Jane she could stay here
for the night.

1:14:22.545 --> 1:14:24.677
It's --
It's safe here.

1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:31.510
I'm really sorry about the park
and lying to you.

1:14:33.556 --> 1:14:34.948
It won't happen again.

1:14:34.992 --> 1:14:37.124
Thank you.
I appreciate your apology,

1:14:37.168 --> 1:14:39.431
but the fact remains the
time machine is still broken.

1:14:39.475 --> 1:14:40.780
Let me help you fix it.

1:14:40.824 --> 1:14:42.434
I have the resources.

1:14:42.478 --> 1:14:44.610
May I ask what you do
to have such resources?

1:14:44.654 --> 1:14:46.743
I'm the C.E.O. of
Anders Enterprises,

1:14:46.786 --> 1:14:48.919
a biotech company
founded by my parents.

1:14:48.962 --> 1:14:51.138
Biotech,
as in biotechnology?

1:14:51.182 --> 1:14:53.401
Yes. With a focus
on neuroscience

1:14:53.445 --> 1:14:54.968
and genetic engineering.

1:14:55.012 --> 1:14:56.840
I can only imagine
the advancements.

1:14:56.883 --> 1:14:58.363
How incredibly impressive.

1:14:58.406 --> 1:15:00.147
My parents were impressive.

1:15:00.191 --> 1:15:01.845
I'm just the daughter
who inherited it.

1:15:03.455 --> 1:15:05.109
I always believed
that technology would be

1:15:05.152 --> 1:15:07.024
the cure to society's illsm

1:15:07.067 --> 1:15:09.243
that it would be
the path to peace.

1:15:09.287 --> 1:15:11.681
Your utopia.

1:15:11.724 --> 1:15:13.596
And I couldn't have
been more wrong.

1:15:15.206 --> 1:15:17.556
My parents died
when I was a little girl.

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:20.733
They were all I had.

1:15:20.777 --> 1:15:23.562
No siblings,
no extended family.

1:15:23.606 --> 1:15:25.564
There is no one else.

1:15:25.608 --> 1:15:27.523
Why are you
telling me this?

1:15:27.566 --> 1:15:30.482
I took the shirt you were
wearing when you first arrived

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:34.225
and had a genealogy test done
from the blood and DNA on it.

1:15:34.268 --> 1:15:36.444
The preliminary results
are back,

1:15:36.488 --> 1:15:38.359
and I'm not really
sure how,

1:15:38.403 --> 1:15:43.495
but you and I --

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:45.149
we're family.

1:15:54.637 --> 1:15:56.813
I wish
I could offer you more.

1:15:56.856 --> 1:16:00.338
Some form of insight
into how we're related.

1:16:00.381 --> 1:16:02.732
When you showed up in my life
all those years ago,

1:16:02.775 --> 1:16:04.516
I didn't believe you.

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:06.344
But I did what you said.

1:16:06.387 --> 1:16:07.998
I looked for
the time machine.

1:16:08.041 --> 1:16:11.262
And I finally found it in your
basement at 10 Mornington Lane.

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:12.916
Camden Town.
Yes.

1:16:12.959 --> 1:16:15.092
And I had it restored.

1:16:15.135 --> 1:16:19.052
And a part of me
has always been waiting...

1:16:20.967 --> 1:16:22.578
hoping.

1:16:25.015 --> 1:16:27.017
I'm just happy
you're here.

1:16:33.153 --> 1:16:34.285
Get some rest.

1:16:34.328 --> 1:16:35.634
It's been a long day.

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:37.897
Thank you, Vanessa,
for your kindness.

1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:42.119
Good night.

1:16:53.043 --> 1:16:54.653
Oh, hello again.

1:16:54.697 --> 1:16:55.915
Oh, hello, uh...

1:16:55.959 --> 1:16:57.177
It's Griffin.

1:16:57.221 --> 1:16:58.309
Yes, Griffin.

1:16:58.352 --> 1:17:00.006
And you're George...
Wells.

1:17:00.050 --> 1:17:01.617
-Yes.
-Have you seen Vanessa?

1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:02.922
She's in her office.

1:17:02.966 --> 1:17:04.228
Care for a drink?

1:17:04.271 --> 1:17:05.838
Oh, it's -- it's late.

1:17:05.882 --> 1:17:06.883
Perhaps another time,
though.

1:17:06.926 --> 1:17:08.188
Sure.

1:17:08.232 --> 1:17:10.669
Sorry,
Vanessa mentioned that

1:17:10.713 --> 1:17:13.367
you're a descendant
of the real H.G. Wells.

1:17:13.411 --> 1:17:14.630
Yes, that's correct.

1:17:14.673 --> 1:17:15.718
How so?

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:16.806
I beg your pardon?

1:17:16.849 --> 1:17:18.285
A direct descendant?

1:17:18.329 --> 1:17:20.157
Um, was he
your great-great-grandfather,

1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:21.985
a distant cousin?

1:17:22.028 --> 1:17:24.117
Oh,
it's a complicated lineage.

1:17:24.161 --> 1:17:25.684
Ah.

1:17:25.728 --> 1:17:27.817
Um, how long
are you staying?

1:17:27.860 --> 1:17:29.906
Oh,
I'm not sure exactly.

1:17:29.949 --> 1:17:31.385
Is there a problem?

1:17:31.429 --> 1:17:32.691
No.
No, no.

1:17:32.735 --> 1:17:35.520
Just...
making conversation.

1:17:35.563 --> 1:17:37.087
If there's anything you need
while you're in the city,

1:17:37.130 --> 1:17:38.218
just let me know.

1:17:38.262 --> 1:17:40.090
Thank you.
That's very kind.

1:17:40.133 --> 1:17:41.831
All right, it's late.

1:17:41.874 --> 1:17:43.702
I'll be off.
-Sure.

1:17:43.746 --> 1:17:44.834
Have a good night, George.

1:17:44.877 --> 1:17:46.749
You too.

1:17:57.411 --> 1:17:58.891
May I?

1:17:58.935 --> 1:18:00.023
Come in.

1:18:08.161 --> 1:18:10.337
This place is insane.

1:18:10.381 --> 1:18:12.035
Are you sure it's okay
that I stay here?

1:18:12.078 --> 1:18:13.732
I think it's a good idea,

1:18:13.776 --> 1:18:15.212
at least until
we find John.

1:18:15.255 --> 1:18:16.692
It's safe here.

1:18:16.735 --> 1:18:20.173
Vanessa has some very large men
guarding her.

1:18:21.784 --> 1:18:24.395
Vanessa's one of the richest
women in the world.

1:18:24.438 --> 1:18:26.832
She might be
even wealthier than Oprah.

1:18:26.876 --> 1:18:28.660
What is an Oprah?

1:18:28.704 --> 1:18:30.488
Never mind.

1:18:30.531 --> 1:18:32.142
How does she know you?

1:18:32.185 --> 1:18:34.710
It's okay. You can sit.

1:18:34.753 --> 1:18:36.712
Right.

1:18:38.801 --> 1:18:40.759
Uh, well...

1:18:40.803 --> 1:18:43.544
it appears that
Vanessa and I are related.

1:18:43.588 --> 1:18:46.809
Apparently,
I visited her years ago,

1:18:46.852 --> 1:18:47.984
and I gave her this.

1:18:48.027 --> 1:18:50.116
It's how she knew
to find me.

1:18:51.814 --> 1:18:54.077
You traveled to the past
and gave this to her?

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:57.167
Well, actually, her past,
my future, it's --

1:18:57.210 --> 1:18:58.908
that's how she knew
she would see me again.

1:18:58.951 --> 1:19:01.693
Okay,
that makes my head spin.

1:19:01.737 --> 1:19:03.608
Mine, too.

1:19:08.178 --> 1:19:10.528
What does this emblem mean?

1:19:10.571 --> 1:19:11.790
I don't know.

1:19:11.834 --> 1:19:14.010
It's something from my future,
I assume.

1:19:14.053 --> 1:19:16.012
Why didn't you write more
in this letter?

1:19:16.055 --> 1:19:18.275
Trust me,
I've been racking my brain.

1:19:18.318 --> 1:19:21.452
Clearly, I needed to convince
myself to trust Vanessa,

1:19:21.495 --> 1:19:25.151
but there is a danger
to knowing your future.

1:19:25.195 --> 1:19:27.371
You would be tempted
to alter it.

1:19:27.414 --> 1:19:30.243
Maybe the future you
was scared you might do that.

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:33.812
Which implies that something
must happen that would tempt me.

1:19:33.856 --> 1:19:36.554
What if
you don't find John?

1:19:36.597 --> 1:19:38.295
I will find John,

1:19:38.338 --> 1:19:40.123
and he will pay
for what he did to you.

1:19:40.166 --> 1:19:41.341
I promise you.

1:19:41.385 --> 1:19:42.821
It's okay.

1:19:42.865 --> 1:19:44.736
I'm tougher than I look.

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:46.825
Right.

1:19:46.869 --> 1:19:48.305
You're from Texas.

1:19:48.348 --> 1:19:51.264
Good memory.

1:19:51.308 --> 1:19:53.614
It's nice
to see you smile.

1:19:55.703 --> 1:19:58.358
You have
a very pretty smile.

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:04.277
I am terribly sorry for bringing
such mayhem into your life.

1:20:04.321 --> 1:20:08.499
I moved to this city
to have this big life.

1:20:08.542 --> 1:20:10.849
And I have a good life.

1:20:10.893 --> 1:20:15.593
You being here
is a very big deal, huge,

1:20:15.636 --> 1:20:20.032
so please don't be sorry.

1:20:22.121 --> 1:20:24.863
You truly are a ray of light,
Ms. Walker.

1:20:26.517 --> 1:20:28.301
You got to start
calling me Jane.

1:20:28.345 --> 1:20:30.216
Right.

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:31.914
Very well.

1:20:31.957 --> 1:20:35.134
I'll start tomorrow.

1:20:39.008 --> 1:20:41.184
Until then.

1:20:50.671 --> 1:20:53.326
So, what has you
so glum tonight?

1:20:53.370 --> 1:20:56.721
Do you believe people
have the power to change?

1:20:59.115 --> 1:21:02.031
Truly change who they are?

1:21:02.074 --> 1:21:04.685
Wow.
So heady with your whiskey.

1:21:06.165 --> 1:21:09.560
Well, yes,
I think people canchange.

1:21:09.603 --> 1:21:10.691
They have the ability,

1:21:10.735 --> 1:21:13.999
but I don't think they do,
not really.

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:16.349
People hate change.
It's too hard.

1:21:16.393 --> 1:21:18.177
Yes.

1:21:18.221 --> 1:21:21.354
It does seem
overwhelming.

1:21:26.751 --> 1:21:30.537
What do you say we, uh, take
this somewhere a little quieter

1:21:30.581 --> 1:21:35.020
and have ourselves
a proper drink?

1:21:35.064 --> 1:21:38.154
Well,
that's more like it.
