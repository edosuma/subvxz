00:31.188 --> 00:34.924
Okay, everyone. I think
we all know what's going on here.

00:34.925 --> 00:39.448
I'm sure you knew this day
was coming sooner or later.

00:39.849 --> 00:44.366
I understand your concern, but
that language was inappropriate.

00:44.367 --> 00:47.076
I'm a Crystal Gem.
I'm a big boy now.

00:47.077 --> 00:51.568
And I got to stop saying stuff like,
"I'm a big boy now."

00:52.569 --> 00:58.614
Look, I'm sure this is tough, but
let's all be positive about this.

00:58.682 --> 01:03.018
Man, I guess I can't be in
the Ninja Squad anymore.

01:03.086 --> 01:07.040
Get out of my life, Ninja Squad!

01:07.041 --> 01:09.758
Yeah! New Ninja Squad!

01:09.826 --> 01:13.429
Mm. That's everything for now.
Hmm?

01:13.497 --> 01:16.799
Oh.
Master of ceremonies bear bear.

01:16.867 --> 01:20.703
I guess I should get rid of you, too?

01:20.770 --> 01:22.571
Nah.
You never know when I'll need

01:22.672 --> 01:25.938
a cool deejay for a fun party, right?

01:26.224 --> 01:29.440
Who-o-o-o-ah!

01:29.441 --> 01:33.157
- Uh. Garnet!
- Good morning to you, Steven.

01:33.158 --> 01:37.012
Boy, I sure am lucky
you showed up when you did.

01:37.013 --> 01:40.156
- Luck's got nothing to do with it.
- Wait.

01:40.223 --> 01:43.425
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't worry about it.

01:43.493 --> 01:46.028
No, seriously.
How do you always know

01:46.096 --> 01:47.696
- where to be?
- Mmm.

01:47.764 --> 01:50.699
I don't think you can handle
that information.

01:50.767 --> 01:55.437
Are you gonna tell me
something cool about yourself?

01:55.505 --> 01:57.806
- Nope.
- Aw, come on.

01:57.874 --> 02:03.379
- I'm a ... large... man now.
- Well...

02:03.446 --> 02:08.517
I guess you could say that
I have a sort of... future vision.

02:08.618 --> 02:13.063
I'm able to see possible
outcomes to most situations,

02:13.064 --> 02:17.151
which comes in handy since you
seem to attract a lot of danger.

02:17.152 --> 02:21.764
- Well, danger is my middle name.
- That's a lie.

02:21.831 --> 02:25.701
Your middle name is cutie pie.

03:01.204 --> 03:03.906
But the day still has
so much potential.

03:04.007 --> 03:06.609
Garnet, what are my breakfast
possibilities?

03:06.676 --> 03:09.078
Well, you're already
outside, so you'll probably

03:09.145 --> 03:14.357
- go to the Big Donut.
- Wow. That's amazing.

03:14.358 --> 03:18.410
Um, do you see any
possible futures where

03:18.411 --> 03:22.558
you, um, come with me
and have a great time?

03:22.626 --> 03:23.800
Hmm.

03:33.803 --> 03:36.105
- Yes.
- Really?!

03:36.172 --> 03:37.680
Then let's go!

03:38.988 --> 03:43.815
- So, can Pearl and Amethyst see the future, too?
- No one can see the future.

03:43.916 --> 03:47.365
<i>I can see options and trajectories.</i>

03:47.366 --> 03:50.519
<i>Time is like a river that splits</i>

03:50.587 --> 03:53.797
<i>into creeks or pools into lakes</i>

03:53.798 --> 03:56.592
<i>or careens down waterfalls.</i>

03:56.693 --> 04:00.863
I have the map, and I steer the ship.

04:02.498 --> 04:04.533
I ... see.

04:06.803 --> 04:09.071
So, what would happen if I said

04:09.139 --> 04:11.006
- hi to Sadie?
- The most probable

04:11.107 --> 04:13.676
outcome is that Sadie will say hi back.

04:13.743 --> 04:19.348
- Hmm. Hi, Sadie!
- Oh, hi, Steven.

04:19.416 --> 04:23.352
Oh, that was an easy one.
What would happen if...

04:23.420 --> 04:25.613
I said hi to my BFF, Lars?

04:25.614 --> 04:30.459
Our friendship is deep, but complicated.
So the outcome of this

04:30.527 --> 04:34.997
- experiment is way unpredictable.
- I see a single

04:35.065 --> 04:37.733
potential future where Lars
gives you a high five.

04:38.459 --> 04:40.336
And two more

04:40.437 --> 04:42.671
potential futures where you
suffer third-degree burns

04:42.739 --> 04:48.677
- all over your body.
- A high five ... from Lars!

04:48.745 --> 04:51.980
- Hi, Lars!
- Ughh!

04:52.048 --> 04:55.884
- Ohh!
- Criminy! Are you okay?!

04:55.952 --> 05:00.569
- That coffee was really hot!
- I drink coffee for breakfast.

05:04.928 --> 05:06.049
Funny.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.467
You know exactly what I want.

05:11.534 --> 05:14.536
Any possible futures here
where I'm hurt by this?

05:14.604 --> 05:18.592
Hmm.
Mm. Tons.

05:18.627 --> 05:20.976
Uh... like... what?

05:21.077 --> 05:24.680
Well, for starters...

05:24.748 --> 05:27.483
<i>...you could just be
going on about your business,</i>

05:27.550 --> 05:30.052
<i>eating your fry bits, and then
suddenly you choke to death!</i>

05:32.622 --> 05:36.058
<i>Or you get so distracted that
you fall down a manhole!</i>

05:38.027 --> 05:41.563
<i>You could get food poisoning,
or be bullied by wasps.</i>

05:45.545 --> 05:49.047
And that's just a few instances
off the top of my head.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.721
W-What if I stand
perfectly still?

05:55.822 --> 05:59.354
You'll probably get
a really bad sunburn. Yeah.

05:59.389 --> 06:00.826
Uh, Garnet, wait up!

06:24.984 --> 06:28.053
Cookie cat! You're real?!

06:28.121 --> 06:30.622
Oh, noo!
I ever considered that you

06:30.690 --> 06:32.891
would be evil!

06:38.097 --> 06:39.565
Steven.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.833
Nice helmet.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.103
Yeah.
You ... You never

06:45.171 --> 06:48.707
know when you're gonna ride a bike.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.076
And you're making a sandwich.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.946
Yeah.
Just got to pick up the knife

06:54.013 --> 06:57.816
and... s-spread the mayonnaise.

06:57.884 --> 07:03.283
Pick up the...
the knife!

07:05.258 --> 07:10.162
Pick up...
kni-i-fe!

07:10.229 --> 07:12.965
Steven.

07:13.032 --> 07:18.537
Wait! Wait! I've got it.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.774
- That will kill you faster.
- Not funny!

07:22.842 --> 07:26.520
- Oh.
- Nice noggin, Steven.

07:27.814 --> 07:28.847
Huh!

07:28.915 --> 07:30.983
- We're ready, Garnet.
- Wait.

07:31.050 --> 07:34.586
You're going on a mission?
Hold on! Don't leave me!

07:34.654 --> 07:37.923
At least tell me what's gonna
happen with my lunch!

07:37.991 --> 07:41.727
- Do I choke on a pickle?
- Mm, you don't choke

07:41.794 --> 07:44.062
- on a pickle.
- That means something

07:44.130 --> 07:46.531
- else happens with the pickle!
- Garnet!

07:46.633 --> 07:50.976
- Shouldn't we be going?
- Steven, I can't be with you all the time.

07:50.977 --> 07:54.266
Just trust me when I say that
you are in control.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.518
Do not go on the roof!

07:56.553 --> 08:00.317
No matter what.

08:13.479 --> 08:18.250
What could possibly happen
to me on the roof?

08:22.062 --> 08:22.687
Ugh.

08:25.436 --> 08:27.692
Okay. Calm down.

08:27.794 --> 08:30.937
Maybe I should just get a snack.

08:30.972 --> 08:32.931
But what if ...

08:32.999 --> 08:35.066
Ooh!

08:35.134 --> 08:36.034
Ugh!

08:36.034 --> 08:38.736
How come you guys are back?!

08:38.804 --> 08:42.741
- We're made of magic.
- Yeah! Magic!

08:48.748 --> 08:52.717
Ugh!

08:52.785 --> 08:55.809

08:55.810 --> 08:57.322
<i> I'm a big boy now!</i>

08:57.390 --> 09:00.025
<i>Big boy now!
Boy now!</i>

09:00.092 --> 09:04.095
What's happening to me?
I'm supposed to be

09:04.163 --> 09:06.998
a Crystal Gem.
I'm supposed to be

09:07.066 --> 09:09.534
a Crystal Gem!

09:25.284 --> 09:31.189
Okay. I'm here. What are
you gonna do to me, future?

09:35.061 --> 09:37.262
Steven!
Get off the roof!

09:37.330 --> 09:41.199
No!
If something is going to happen

09:41.267 --> 09:44.703
- to me, just let it happen.
- Steven!

09:44.770 --> 09:48.151
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.183
Everything I do shoves me
violently towards the end!

09:51.184 --> 09:54.835
The more I know, the more
I know that I don't know!

09:54.836 --> 09:56.307
I can't live like this!

09:56.308 --> 10:00.152
Why did you tell me
about future vision?!

10:00.187 --> 10:03.255
What's going to happen
to me on the roof?!

10:03.322 --> 10:07.125
- This.
- W-What?

10:07.193 --> 10:09.728
I knew you might
do this if I told you about

10:09.795 --> 10:13.888
my power. I saw this,
and I told you, anyway.

10:13.923 --> 10:18.136
- But... why?
- I took a risk at your expense.

10:18.237 --> 10:22.067
There was a chance you'd
understand this, and we'd be closer.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.657
Steven, I see so many things
that can hurt you.

10:26.241 --> 10:29.967
I should never have let one
of them be me.

10:32.100 --> 10:36.355
There are millions of
possibilities for the future,

10:36.465 --> 10:38.977
but it's up to you to
choose which becomes reality.

10:38.978 --> 10:40.358
Please understand.

10:40.459 --> 10:44.896
- You choose your own future.
- I do understand.

10:44.964 --> 10:48.033
I ...

10:48.134 --> 10:50.345
What am I doing?

10:50.346 --> 10:58.792
I guess I can't really see a
future for myself up here.

10:59.145 --> 11:02.113
Mm.

11:02.181 --> 11:06.918
I'll watch out for myself
from now on.

11:09.388 --> 11:13.625
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing important.
