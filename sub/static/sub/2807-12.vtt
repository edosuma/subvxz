WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:06.171
Hey, I got you a present!

00:06.339 --> 00:08.799
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

00:08.967 --> 00:12.678
I got it for your wedding, I ordered it
weeks ago and it finally got here!

00:12.846 --> 00:15.472
Pheebs, you didn't have to get us
anything for our...

00:15.640 --> 00:18.600
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it! Open it!

00:21.187 --> 00:25.274
- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
- Oh, my God!

00:25.442 --> 00:27.526
I didn't know where to put it so I left.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.487
- We can put it in the guest bedroom.
- Yeah, okay.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.495
- I kind of like it here.
- Do you really like it?

00:38.663 --> 00:42.291
Are you kidding? I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

00:42.459 --> 00:46.170
- This was, like, my second favorite game.
- What was your first?

00:46.337 --> 00:50.382
- I don't really remember the name of it.
- Well, what did it do?

00:50.550 --> 00:55.304
Well, you'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.473
A vending machine?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.601
Hey, don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.810
Hey! I'm so glad you guys are here.

01:42.977 --> 01:46.563
I've been dying to tell someone what
happened in the paleontology department.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.775
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

01:50.735 --> 01:54.863
Professor Newman, the head
of the department, is retiring, so...

01:55.115 --> 02:00.202
- They made you head of the department!
- No, I get to teach his advanced class!

02:00.995 --> 02:04.373
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.334
- Oh, hey, Rach, listen, um...
- Yeah.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.002
I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

02:10.588 --> 02:15.259
Uh, Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.844
Ooh. Great, thanks.

02:17.011 --> 02:20.556
And then after, you could take her
to the Four Seasons for drinks.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.643
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.271
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

02:27.438 --> 02:31.066
You sure are naming a lot of ways
to postpone sex, I'll tell you.

02:31.568 --> 02:36.280
Agh, I miss dating. Getting dressed up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.410
I'm not gonna be able to do that
for so long. And it's so much fun.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.248
Not that sitting at home worrying about
giving birth to a 16-pound baby is not fun.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.503
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out?

02:52.046 --> 02:55.007
What? You don't want to go on
a date with a pregnant lady.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.051
Yes, I do. We're gonna go out,
we're gonna have a good time.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.431
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections...

03:02.599 --> 03:05.100
...and giant baby heads stretching out...

03:05.268 --> 03:06.768
Okay, I'll go with you. I'll go.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.438
- It will be fun.
- All right. Okay.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.565
No, no! Yes!

03:13.067 --> 03:14.902
Aw, would you look at that, Monica?

03:15.069 --> 03:17.112
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.907
Okay, I'm next.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.410
No, don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

03:23.578 --> 03:26.830
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.210
- Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game.
- Who cares? It's a stupid game.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.338
Oh, you only think it's stupid
because you suck at it.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.799
I don't suck. It sucks.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.760
You suck.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.140
If this game is gonna
cause problems between you...

03:45.308 --> 03:49.144
...maybe I should keep it.
- No, I love it. It is a great present.

03:49.312 --> 03:53.649
In fact, why don't you go home
and wait for the "Thank You" card?

03:53.816 --> 03:57.152
- Why do you want to play so badly?
- Yeah, it's not like it spits out...

03:57.320 --> 03:59.154
...a Clark Bar after every game.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.909
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair. Come on. Out of the chair.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.828
Phoebe!

04:10.458 --> 04:13.001
Joey, could you get that?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.630
Ugh, Joey...

04:26.182 --> 04:28.016
What? I thought you were in your room.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.687
No, I'm picking you up for our date.
These are for you.

04:32.188 --> 04:36.900
Oh, lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.860
And a brownie.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.615
Well, half a brownie.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.909
Actually, it's just a bag.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.705
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I was starting to feel faint, so...

04:50.290 --> 04:53.667
Oh, man, this is so great!

04:53.835 --> 04:56.295
I actually feel like
I'm going on a real date.

04:56.462 --> 05:01.758
With a hint of morning sickness and I'm
wearing underwear that goes up to about...

05:01.926 --> 05:03.135
...there.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.513
Hey, come on. This is a real date. Uh...

05:06.681 --> 05:08.807
So, nice place you got here.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.478
Foosball, huh? Pizza box.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.399
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.568
Actually, that's my roommate's.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.530
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.824
But he's very protective of me...

05:25.992 --> 05:27.909
...so you'd better watch yourself.
- Ah.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.954
Hey, so, this roommate of yours,
is he good-looking?

05:31.122 --> 05:33.248
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, yeah.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.251
- Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
- Ha, ha.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.628
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.382
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

05:45.553 --> 05:48.930
Which brings us back, of course,
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.516
That's it for today.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.187
Oh, uh, does anyone know
where the Freeman Building is?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.689
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.316
What? That's across town.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.943
I'm supposed to teach a seminar there
in 10 minutes.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.321
Ooh, dude, that's not gonna happen.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.534
Move it. Move it. Move it!

06:09.702 --> 06:11.953
Hey! I'm the teacher!

06:25.676 --> 06:27.219
Hello.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.058
Sorry I'm a little late. Uh...

06:33.226 --> 06:34.643
Whoa, a lot late.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.856
Uh, well, let me start by,
uh, introducing myself.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.650
I'm, uh, Professor Geller.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.987
So to sum up...

06:46.155 --> 06:48.990
...I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.621
Now, the filet mignon,
what comes with that?

06:54.789 --> 06:56.415
A side of steamed vegetables.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.834
Mm.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.628
Instead of the vegetables...

07:01.796 --> 07:06.341
...is there any way that I could
substitute the, um...

07:06.509 --> 07:08.427
...three-pound lobster?

07:10.346 --> 07:12.347
You know what? Bring her both.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.182
And I'll have the same.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.854
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.398
Oh, I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no roommate stuff. We're on a date.

07:24.944 --> 07:29.865
Okay. Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.116
Do you have any moves?

07:31.284 --> 07:35.537
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for...

07:38.124 --> 07:40.125
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.880
I knew it. Come on, tell me your moves.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.548
Uh, all right. Um...

07:46.716 --> 07:48.341
Well...

07:48.509 --> 07:53.013
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.725
Oh, my God. And that works?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.853
It does when you combine it with,
"This is embarrassing.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.230
I just want to have a normal life."

08:02.398 --> 08:04.941
- Aw, you poor little famous man.
- Mm-hm.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.944
Oh, okay, how about this one?

08:08.988 --> 08:12.032
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you...

08:12.200 --> 08:15.494
...but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.664
Oh, my God! Ha.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.128
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. I really almost did.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.506
All right, so tell me one of your moves.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.716
All right. Ahem.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.888
So where'd you grow up?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.515
That's your move?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.602
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.773
- Come on, just answer the question.
- Ugh. Queens.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.359
And so were you close to your parents?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.071
- With my mom. Not so much my dad.
- Why not?

08:51.239 --> 08:54.074
I don't know. I guess there's just
always been this distance.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.869
I mean, we both try to pretend
it's not there, but it is.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.663
Mm.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.331
It's gotta be rough.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.335
It is. Yeah, it's really tough.
You know, sometimes I think...

09:05.503 --> 09:07.546
Wow!

09:09.674 --> 09:12.425
- Nice move!
- Uh-huh.

09:12.593 --> 09:16.346
- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
- Thank you.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.266
Ha, ha. Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

09:22.812 --> 09:27.065
- And now you're watching me walk away.
- Yes, I am! Again, so simple.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.236
Hey.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.949
- You're not gonna believe what I did today.
- Clearly wasn't showering or shaving.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.869
I got good. I played this game all day,
and now I rule at it.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.831
They should change the name
of it to "Ms. Chandler."

09:45.209 --> 09:46.501
Although, I hope they don't.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.838
You stayed home all day
and played Ms. Pac-Man...

09:50.006 --> 09:52.007
...while I went off to work
like some chump?

09:52.717 --> 09:57.887
Uh-huh. I got the top ten scores.
I erased Phoebe off the board. High-five!

09:59.515 --> 10:01.558
What is the matter with your hand?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.188
I been playing for eight hours.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.275
It'll loosen up. Come on,
check out the scores.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.903
And also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

10:14.071 --> 10:18.366
- Chandler, why would you do that?
- Because it's awesome.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.118
You think this is clever?

10:20.286 --> 10:24.539
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.878
- This one's not dirty.
- It is when you put it together with that one.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.713
Oh. Heh.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.300
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.846
Ben's coming over here tomorrow.
This can't be there.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.933
- He won't know what they mean.
- He's 7, not stupid.

10:44.101 --> 10:48.688
- Have you talked to him lately?
- Look, I'm gonna unplug it.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.940
No, no! I'll have nothing
to show for my day.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.400
It'll be like I was at work.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.778
No!

10:56.322 --> 10:57.947
Hey, look! It's still there!

10:58.115 --> 11:01.493
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip in it or something!

11:01.661 --> 11:04.746
- You gotta beat your scores.
- With the claw?

11:04.914 --> 11:08.625
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off the screen.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.836
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

11:12.838 --> 11:16.508
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

11:19.929 --> 11:24.766
- I am not gonna answer that.
- Oh, come on. Just pick one.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.435
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross...

11:27.603 --> 11:31.147
...if you had to... If you had to,
who would you punch?

11:31.941 --> 11:34.984
No one. They're my friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.278
Chandler?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.155
Yeah, but I don't know why.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.327
- I'm having a wonderful time!
- Me too.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.787
Hey, Rach, can I just say...

11:45.955 --> 11:48.540
...I think this is the best date I ever had.
- I know!

11:48.708 --> 11:52.419
I've never laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

11:52.586 --> 11:56.047
Yes. Joey, I think everybody saw
the wine come out of your nose.

11:56.215 --> 12:01.052
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

12:01.220 --> 12:05.640
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.308
Huh.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.811
All right. Now don't judge me.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.064
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but you live here.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.441
I'm ripping into the swan.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.360
Okay, well then, you don't judge me.

12:17.528 --> 12:21.197
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from the brownie I had before.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.247
Mm. Mm.

12:29.999 --> 12:34.711
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

12:36.130 --> 12:40.967
Uh, well, if I want the girl to kiss me...

12:41.135 --> 12:44.429
...first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.347
How do you do it?

12:46.515 --> 12:50.018
Now you can't tell anyone, but, uh...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.479
...I put on shiny lip balm.

12:54.523 --> 12:58.818
- Oh, my God.
- Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.448
- Okay, all right, so now you go.
- No, I don't want to tell you.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.450
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.286
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.041
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

13:13.709 --> 13:17.212
- Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
- Ha, ha.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.255
Okay. All right, stand up.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.178
Well, when we're at the door...

13:25.554 --> 13:30.433
...I lightly press my lips against his.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.813
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.565
And then I make this sound:

13:38.150 --> 13:40.527
Mmm.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.366
I know it doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.577
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

13:50.746 --> 13:54.207
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.084
- Mwah.
- Oh, yeah.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.216
Me too.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.105
You were 50 minutes late to the class?
Did you crawl there?

14:17.273 --> 14:20.400
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.612
When did people stop understanding
"Get the hell out of my way"?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.198
Why didn't you take a cab?

14:27.366 --> 14:32.495
Ugh. Between the traffic and one-way
streets, it'd take me twice as long.

14:32.663 --> 14:37.166
Besides, I teach the class three times
a week. Who am I, Rockefeller?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.545
You're not gonna be able
to keep doing this.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.716
I have to. If I don't,
they'll take the class away from me.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.677
And I already put it
in my family newsletter.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.265
- Your what?
- You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.769
Right. Wow.

14:57.229 --> 15:02.358
Besides, I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

15:02.526 --> 15:06.487
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.618
- Hey.
- Hi!

15:11.785 --> 15:14.746
Hey, remember, um, last night
when we were talking about Cujo?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.249
Oh, yeah, I can't believe you haven't
seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.418
Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.962
Have you ever tried to sit through
Citizen Kane?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.965
Yeah, I know. It's really boring.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.384
- But it's a big deal.
- Yeah.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.721
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo sometime.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.349
Well, yeah, all right.
Let's do it tonight.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.102
- Don't you have that big date tonight?
- Oh, right.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.940
- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.859
After our date last night,
did you feel a little weird?

15:45.027 --> 15:49.781
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.950
I don't know.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.453
I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.542
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

16:01.710 --> 16:05.338
- I was up sick all night.
- Yeah, me too. All night.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.049
Really? How come
we didn't cross paths?

16:08.217 --> 16:10.677
Yeah, well, that's because, uh...

16:11.679 --> 16:12.845
...I stayed in my room.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.475
Yeah, you don't want to look
in my hamper.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.982
Okay, I got that.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.985
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.570
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man...

16:31.865 --> 16:34.242
Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?

16:37.579 --> 16:39.747
Hey, you guys?

16:39.915 --> 16:43.710
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

16:43.877 --> 16:49.007
Oh, my God, your friends
have some unfortunate initials.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.343
- They're all Chandler.
- Chandler sucks.

16:52.511 --> 16:56.014
- He couldn't have gotten this good.
- I did.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.641
- But it came at a price.
- Ugh.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.228
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.897
Come on, by age 7,
kids have already seen orgies.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.570
Was it just me?

17:21.248 --> 17:23.915
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.337
Agh.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.341
Okay, why don't we all, uh...

17:34.887 --> 17:37.680
...open our books to page 23...

17:37.931 --> 17:39.348
...where...

17:40.768 --> 17:43.936
...where you will see a, uh...

17:45.606 --> 17:49.692
...a bunch of, uh, red spots.

17:51.070 --> 17:55.990
Okay, why don't, uh,
you all start to read, while I...

18:05.334 --> 18:08.669
Hey, are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.340
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

18:13.383 --> 18:15.843
Hey, can I ask you something?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.055
Have you ever looked at someone
that you've known for a while...

18:19.223 --> 18:22.517
...and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

18:22.976 --> 18:24.769
You mean like from behind?

18:29.525 --> 18:32.693
Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly it.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.986
You know what?

18:34.154 --> 18:37.490
One time I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.118
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

18:41.537 --> 18:46.290
Ooh, yeah. So you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.918
- Totally! Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.840
- Would you excuse me for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.891
Eh.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.812
- God, Phoebe! You're on fire!
- I know!

19:09.189 --> 19:10.648
- You can do it!
- Don't touch me!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.150
Don't touch her!

19:12.317 --> 19:14.694
All right, go left! Go right! Go right!

19:14.862 --> 19:16.028
I can't! I can't!

19:17.406 --> 19:19.991
No! You son of a...

19:33.255 --> 19:34.589
Phoebe!

19:35.549 --> 19:38.176
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

19:48.270 --> 19:50.646
Aah! God! Thank God you're home.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.107
- I'm watching Cujo.
- Alone?

19:53.275 --> 19:57.612
- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
- Did you get to the part...

19:57.779 --> 20:01.199
...where they're in the car and Cujo's
throwing himself at the windshield?

20:01.366 --> 20:04.994
No. No! Seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.039
What are you doing home?
What happened to your date?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.583
Oh, uh, it didn't work out.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.169
Want to watch
the rest of the movie with me?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.796
Oh, uh, okay. Yeah.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.299
I never thought I'd say this
about a movie...

20:18.467 --> 20:20.593
...but I hope this dog dies.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.765
What are you doing over there?
Come sit here. Protect me.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.101
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

20:33.607 --> 20:35.191
Okay.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.658
- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
- All right, I know.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.286
It's gonna be okay.

20:47.537 --> 20:51.582
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.880
Ugh, seriously, how can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.011
Terrified.

21:14.481 --> 21:19.360
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.528
Let us begin.

21:20.696 --> 21:26.909
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.871
Here...

21:31.540 --> 21:34.834
...and here.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.713
Now, as for the hadrosaurus...
