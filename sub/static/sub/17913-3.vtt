00:12.600 --> 00:14.320
How do you meet anyone sitting here?

00:14.400 --> 00:17.320
It's early, mate. Everyone's sober.
You have to wait that bit out.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.920
I think I might be running out of time.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.760
Bars don't close till 3:00.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.160
No, I mean, generally.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.840
I'm already one marriage down.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.480
Everyone else is going to overtake me.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.800
Oh, women love it when men
rant about time running out.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.280
Throw in something
about their declining fertility

00:30.360 --> 00:31.760
- as well there.
- [both chuckle]

00:31.840 --> 00:33.280
The worst thing is, I had someone.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.160
- Could you and Helen still...
- No, no, I don't mean Helen.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.560
No, that is well and truly buggered.
[chuckles]

00:38.640 --> 00:40.600
I mean Holly. That girl.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.080
[exhales] She was amazing.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.720
Yeah, you'll find someone else.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.400
Ooh, Luke promised to help me,
but we're still sitting here.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.040
Because it's early, Angus.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.680
If I leave it too long, I'll get tired,
and I won't want to stay up to have sex.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.040
There's your opening line.
Show the lady your schedule.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.520
It's all right for you guys, though.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.000
Engaged. Gorgeous girlfriend.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.400
Not attached,
but obviously delighted about that.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.720
Are you?

01:05.120 --> 01:06.800
- What?
- I was asking if you're all right.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.360
- You seem a bit...
- I'm good, I'm good.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.120
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great. I'm better.
I'm the best. The bestest.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.840
Okay, saddle up, Angus.
I'm gonna take you for a spin.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.720
Ooh, are we gonna talk
to some actual women?

01:15.800 --> 01:18.920
You make it sound so exotic.
"Oh, what are these women things?"

01:19.000 --> 01:20.840
[laughs] You don't count.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.280
- He's gonna be married again by Tuesday.
- [both chuckle]

01:24.360 --> 01:25.560
Nice to be out together

01:25.640 --> 01:27.720
without Luke screaming
that I'm in love with you.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.400
[inhales sharply]

01:30.320 --> 01:32.440
Sorry. Shit. Sorry. Er...

01:32.520 --> 01:35.440
- It's okay. [Chuckles]
- [sighs]

01:35.520 --> 01:37.680
Er, who's this girl
that Angus says you're seeing?

01:37.760 --> 01:41.040
Er, Abigail.
She's on my, erm... The chlamydia list.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.040
There's the beginning
of your wedding speech.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.160
Yeah. Er, anyway, she got in touch to say
that I haven't given her chlamydia.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.640
She's great.
She's good. I really like her.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.800
I'm not saying that
'cause of what Luke said.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.280
I believe you.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.680
Anyway, erm, Luke's been acting weird
since he found out Phoebe died, and...

02:00.160 --> 02:03.040
I don't think we need to discuss
the whole thing anymore, so...

02:03.120 --> 02:05.000
- No, me neither. Good.
- Great.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.680
Er, has everyone got back to you now?

02:08.160 --> 02:11.320
Er, nearly.
I heard back from Amy yesterday.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Did you now?

02:21.320 --> 02:23.720
Sorry. Er, were you wanting...

02:23.800 --> 02:25.240
Kind of was, actually.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.160
Mmm... well.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.840
- This is, er, slightly awkward.
- [chuckles]

02:30.920 --> 02:33.120
You see, ordinarily,
I'd be a gentleman about this,

02:33.200 --> 02:35.840
but, erm,
I really like Chelsea buns. So...

02:36.320 --> 02:38.400
- Fistfight?
- [laughs]

02:38.480 --> 02:40.800
- Take it.
- Oh, you're too kind.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.080
I'd have won that fistfight.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.560
But, erm, I think you knew that.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.160
What you reading?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.280
Hemingway.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.360
- You don't like Hemingway?
- I do.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.840
I'm actually prone to heavy drinking
and denigrating women myself.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.000
[both chuckling]

03:10.160 --> 03:11.080
I left you half.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.000
If I drink any more coffee,
I'm gonna have a stroke.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.840
- [chuckles]
- I'm gonna get the bill.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.480
- No, it's on me.
- Thank you.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.840
So, I guess this was a date.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.240
Are you gonna take me home now?

03:31.720 --> 03:33.840
I gave you half my bun.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.600
I definitely feel like I've wooed you.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.440
[Amy and Dylan chuckle]

03:39.680 --> 03:41.320
I do feel wooed.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
[both chuckle]

03:44.120 --> 03:45.880
[birds chirping]

03:45.960 --> 03:48.720
[Dylan] Morning. Sleep okay?

03:48.800 --> 03:53.240
I think I can see animal shapes
in the damp patches on your ceiling.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.640
[inhales sharply] Yeah, maybe next time
we could go to yours?

03:56.720 --> 03:59.640
Mmm. I live an hour away, by train.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.960
[Dylan] Mmm.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.280
- Are you tipping me?
- Train fare.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.480
Come and visit.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.320
Please stay.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.360
You're definitely the nicest thing
in my room by quite a long way.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.440
[gasps] So cheesy!

04:17.519 --> 04:18.680
Not really a compliment.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.760
It's more of a damning indictment
of my living situation.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.360
Well, I've got plans today,

04:25.440 --> 04:28.880
but I'm in town till Sunday night.
Want to meet later?

04:28.960 --> 04:32.440
Great. Erm, anywhere but here.
And then...

04:32.520 --> 04:35.440
- realistically, back... back here.
- [chuckles]

04:47.720 --> 04:50.280
[sighs] Evie, hey, question...

04:50.360 --> 04:53.240
How are you for money right now?

04:53.320 --> 04:54.520
We're about to spend the day

04:54.600 --> 04:57.200
selling my dead dad's things
so that I can pay the rent.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.280
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.480
So what you're saying is not much
has changed since say... yesterday?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.440
- Spit it out.
- No, no, no, no.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.200
God, it's nothing, no. It's just, er,
a tiny, little fly-arge in the ointment.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.360
What fly?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.040
Oh, Rebecca is moving out.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.560
Well, has moved out.
She moved out last night. So...

05:14.640 --> 05:15.720
- So...
- Why?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.400
That much is not entirely clear.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.800
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.000
- Hey, buddy. God, you look tired.
- [sighs] Hey.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.400
Yeah, I couldn't sleep last night.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.760
Drank about a million jars
of coffee yesterday.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.280
I met a girl in the coffee shop.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.520
[quietly] Anyway, she's really hot.
Sort of, kind of like Evie.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.240
Only she's, like, funny and approachable,
and not cynical and sort of mean.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.760
- [chuckles]
- [object clatters]

05:40.840 --> 05:42.240
[whispers] Shit. Shh.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.800
Oh...

05:46.880 --> 05:48.600
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hello.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.000
Luke, please tell me you haven't
forgotten about today.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.560
No, no, no. God, no, no. Far from it.
That's why Dylan's here.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.120
He's got a driving license.
He's gonna drive the van for us.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.560
So you want me to get this stuff
packed up? [Sighs]

05:59.640 --> 06:02.920
Oh, right. Er, thanks, Dylan, no,
I think we've got it covered.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.480
It's no problem.
Unless you don't want me to be there?

06:05.560 --> 06:07.080
No, no, of course not.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.480
Er, Dylan met a girl yesterday.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.120
Yeah. Sorry. No changing the subject.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.560
Rebecca moving out. What is that about?
Why are you being so shifty?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.120
[stammering] Not shifty. There may...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.760
there may have been some
sexual confusion involved.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.360
Meaning... Rebecca's gay?

06:24.440 --> 06:27.200
No, no. Meaning, I had sex with her
and it caused some confusion.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.000
- [scoffs] Luke!
- [Dylan stutters] Okay, wait a second.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.240
- Maybe this was hard on Luke as well.
- Not really.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.120
What, so now we have to pay her rent?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.520
Yeah, no, she was quite militant
about that point actually.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.840
Accusations were made.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.240
Why would you sleep with our housemate?

06:41.320 --> 06:44.360
- Of all the hundreds of girls since Jo...
- [Luke sputtering]

06:44.440 --> 06:46.280
Hey, come on, it's only been a dozen.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.520
Baker's dozen?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.600
- That's 16, isn't it?
- Don't think so.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.960
Hmm.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.880
Okay, fine. Well, you realize that we now
have to sell everything to cover it.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.760
Yeah.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.480
Okay, let's get on with it.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.800
Amy?

07:02.880 --> 07:03.960
[Amy] Hang on a sec.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.920
[Evie] Can you hurry up?
[Amy] Hang on a sec.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.720
♪ Playing the guitar to you, baby
Rose-Marie ♪

07:11.800 --> 07:16.280
♪ With your lovely boobies ♪

07:16.360 --> 07:19.240
You could not have paid me
to use that guy's shower.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.320
His whole place was... [gasps softly]

07:22.520 --> 07:24.840
How do you know my sister?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.320
Oh, my God.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.920
Oh. You two... are sisters?

07:34.840 --> 07:36.600
[laughs] Oh, fuck, that's hilarious.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.400
[Dylan] Okay, well, er...

07:38.480 --> 07:41.400
We're all good people here so, er,
nothing was done on purpose.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.480
What?

07:42.560 --> 07:45.080
Dylan knows your sister
in much the same way he knows you.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.960
What, like, not very well?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.400
No, like, biblically.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.000
Oh. That's a bit weird.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.000
Oh, this is horrific. Make it stop.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.960
- This isn't Mr. Big Soppy Feelings, is it?
- [shushing]

07:55.040 --> 07:56.640
- Who?
- Did you and Evie

07:56.720 --> 07:58.320
sleep together about two months ago?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.680
Er, Mr. Big Soppy Feelings?

08:00.760 --> 08:02.760
- Tell me this is a dream.
- It's a sex dream.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.320
- If I could take it back...
- Now, which "it" would that be?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.920
Would that be the first "it"
or the second "it"?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.680
[stuttering] "It..." The situation.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.040
[Luke] This is why incest
isn't allowed, isn't it?

08:12.120 --> 08:14.360
It's all these awkward conversations
that come afterwards.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.240
This isn't actual incest.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.200
Hmm, it feels at least a bit incest-y.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.680
- Anyway, the word's "incestuous."
- You'd be the expert.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.400
Okay, let's just get on with it, shall we?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.240
- You're a fucking stallion. That's huge.
- No... What the fuck?

08:28.320 --> 08:30.600
Huge work. Huge. Siblings?

08:30.680 --> 08:32.880
- Shh...
- Maybe... Have you met their mum?

08:44.840 --> 08:46.840
Are you ready to rummage?

08:46.920 --> 08:47.960
Angus.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.640
Thanks for sorting the stall for us.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.440
Pleasure. What's the point of contacts
if you can't exploit them?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.880
Oh, God, I've missed this.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.400
The stalls. The chance of striking gold
in the great riverbed of junk.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.080
- I used to be a collector myself.
- Of what?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.880
The thing you collect is not
as important as the collecting itself.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.040
And it is game day!
The heat is on!

09:07.120 --> 09:08.480
It's antique dolls, isn't it?

09:08.560 --> 09:11.960
- Yeah.
- [scoffing] What? Far from it.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.920
Oh, three towels for a pound.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.040
- I wanna help. I really do.
- [sighs] Great. Let's go.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.720
Erm, look, if it helps,

09:20.800 --> 09:23.160
with the two of you,
it felt really different.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.800
Why are you telling me? I don't want
to know what my sister feels like!

09:26.880 --> 09:29.960
Emotionally! I'm talking about
how the experience felt.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.240
Not the difference between
how your two bodies felt.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.760
As in... As in felt
with my hands and stuff.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.720
The feelings.
Just trying to clarify that.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.480
Stop talking. I can see you thinking
about it, and it's unpleasant.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.040
I wasn't until you raised it.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.200
- Stop talking!
- Sorry.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.600
[whispers] Sorry.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.840
Okay, guys.
It's all gotta go. [Sighs]

10:10.920 --> 10:12.840
Oh, your dad had some great stuff.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.440
Let's see you twirl.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.400
You can have it.
[gasps] Look at me...

10:20.480 --> 10:23.320
I am showering you with gifts.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.080
Yes, shall we, er... shall we go and get
some coffees for these guys?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.880
Right, I'm gonna go and try and find
some wholesale buyers,

10:31.960 --> 10:35.000
so just... sell as much as you can,
'cause it's all got to go.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.040
Yes, you got it.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.480
- [bell dings]
- Open!

10:38.560 --> 10:39.680
I say open.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.320
- I'll give you a tenner for these.
- Oh, classic '60s design.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.040
- Authentic pieces, too.
- Here you go then.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.680
[Luke laughing] First sale!

10:56.760 --> 10:58.440
Ten handsome pounds!

10:58.520 --> 10:59.640
It was worth five times that.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.520
Why did you sell them for a measly tenner?

11:01.600 --> 11:03.120
I don't know. It was awkward!

11:03.200 --> 11:04.480
I thought you loved flea markets!

11:04.560 --> 11:06.200
- As a buyer...
- For... [scoffs]

11:06.280 --> 11:07.520
How much for this lot?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.040
Erm, make... make an offer?

11:09.120 --> 11:13.320
It's mostly junk, but I could sell some
of the sleeves for wall art.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.720
- Twenty quid?
- Derisory.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.480
- What's that?
- My friend here asked you

11:17.560 --> 11:20.360
to make us an offer, not tickle our balls
while you pick our pockets.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.360
Come back to us when you're ready to talk
mano a mano... a mano.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.560
- He was playing us.
- Whoo-hoo! So the sheep become wolves.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
[tea splashing]

11:31.720 --> 11:33.400
- What are you doing?
- Tea is for closers.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.520
- Well, can I have a bit of my muffin?
- Unh-unh. Absolutely not.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.320
I need you hungry, boy.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.080
[muffled] Come and get it, guys!

11:45.400 --> 11:47.360
So, what happened with you and Evie?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.040
Ah, nothing really, you know.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.680
Some booze, a party,
some misunderstandings.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.240
So romantic.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.840
Yeah, we weren't exactly fated.
But now...

11:56.920 --> 11:59.840
Don't worry, you're not gonna
come between us or anything.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.400
We're not that close.
Do you like her?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.160
Er, I don't even know her that well.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.840
It's just, there's, like,
a lot of distance with her.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.080
She's more messy than she looks.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.960
Like, today, she'll be all
"sell, sell, sell,"

12:11.040 --> 12:14.360
but she'll actually be really weird
about selling Dad's stuff.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.680
But you won't see it. Especially around me
when she'll be being, you know,

12:17.760 --> 12:19.600
strong, big sister.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.960
She comes across as tough.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.160
Oh, is that right,
Mr. Big Soppy Feelings?

12:24.240 --> 12:27.280
[chuckles] I'm so glad
that nickname's sticking.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.960
Mmm. It's lovely, that. Mmm...

12:31.040 --> 12:33.000
Lovely little muffin.
Thanks, Angus.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.920
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.440
- How much for this, please?
- Make an offer.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.960
- A pound?
- [scoffs] Am I wearing a nappy?

12:42.040 --> 12:43.280
What?

12:43.360 --> 12:46.360
Am I crying for milk and begging for mama
to put me to the teat? [Laughs]

12:46.920 --> 12:48.040
- No?
- Well,

12:48.120 --> 12:51.840
so put the mug down until you're prepared
to negotiate with me like I'm an adult.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.320
- Two pounds?
- Thank you. Sold.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.520
[chuckles nervously]

12:57.520 --> 12:58.920
[Luke laughs]

12:59.000 --> 13:01.880
- Good work, man. Was it worth two pounds?
- Ah, it was worth eight.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.160
What can I say? I can't take the heat.
Maybe I'm just not cut out for this.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
You're making progress.
School's not out yet.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.680
The bakery doesn't close
till we've sold out of muffins.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.400
- Know what I mean?
- I really do.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.560
What?

13:14.440 --> 13:18.520
Amy. You wanted half the money
from selling all this stuff, right?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.160
I recall that mattering to you.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.080
So, maybe, just maybe,

13:22.160 --> 13:24.160
you could think about helping me
sell some of it?

13:24.240 --> 13:25.840
I'm really sorry. I do want to help.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.040
No, no, no, Dylan, you're doing great.
Somebody needs to drink the coffee.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.920
Anything that gets left...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.320
- is gonna go back to your place.
- But I don't have the room.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.000
You're gonna have even less room.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.600
- I feel like there's a lot of tension...
- Are you jealous?

13:37.680 --> 13:39.560
Because, even for you, this...

13:39.640 --> 13:41.440
- "Even for me"?
- Guys, this doesn't need to...

13:41.520 --> 13:43.760
No, no, no, Dylan. Be quiet, actually.
Amy, you too.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.680
Look, I know that you probably think that
you've found something really wonderful,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.840
but actually, you'd be terrible together.

13:49.920 --> 13:53.080
Amy, you only like Dylan
because he is like our dad.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.600
Falling in love at the drop of a hat.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.880
He's all poetry and flowers,

13:55.960 --> 13:59.200
but actually he's flaky, he's unrealistic,
and he's kind of quite annoying.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.280
And, Dylan, Amy is messed up.
She's needy.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.760
And you're seeing this really funny,
really clever girl,

14:04.840 --> 14:06.720
which she will absolutely be one day,

14:06.800 --> 14:09.800
but you are the worst person
to help her get there.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.400
I don't even like him that much.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.640
He's just better than hanging out with you
and your nagging!

14:13.720 --> 14:15.560
Er, I am sitting right here, you know.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.920
Yeah, it's not nagging, is it?
It's called being an adult.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.160
You're not a child!

14:19.240 --> 14:21.600
I am so bored I could scream.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.200
Ooh... Do you...
Do you need a hug?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.160
It doesn't have to come from me.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.680
[stammering]
I'm just asking if you're okay.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.280
I'm pretty sure your sister dumped me.
That was... That was really harsh,

14:40.360 --> 14:43.080
so I could probably use a hug
if you're, like...

14:44.040 --> 14:46.520
You're unbelievable.
And not in a good way.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.920
[inaudible]

15:09.880 --> 15:11.880
These soul records take me back.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.360
Wonderful songs from wonderful people.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.360
- They're all one person's collection?
- [Angus chuckles]

15:16.440 --> 15:17.720
What would you like for it?

15:19.560 --> 15:21.680
Should we say £100?

15:23.240 --> 15:25.680
Okay, lady.
Why don't you tell Kenny Rogers over there

15:25.760 --> 15:28.560
to come talk to us in person
if he wants to buy these records.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.000
[both chuckle]

15:31.080 --> 15:33.880
Your move, sucker!
I have never felt so alive!

15:33.960 --> 15:35.280
- How's it going?
- Brilliant.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.160
We've seen off
several potential customers.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.960
Right, not quite what I had in mind,
but fuck it.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.120
Hey, if it helps at all,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.520
I have thought of the perfect
new roommate for us.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.040
- Who?
- Dylan!

15:49.120 --> 15:50.440
- [groans]
- Think about it.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.720
I'm not gonna sleep with him,
you're not gonna sleep with him... again.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.960
- [scoffs] Definitely not.
- So he's perfect!

15:56.920 --> 16:00.320
What's the point?
I can't even pay my own rent this month.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.680
And look at this stuff.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.240
What have we sold?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.040
[sighs]

16:07.120 --> 16:09.200
The day is still young.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.280
Okay. [Sighs]
Saddle up, Angus.

16:11.360 --> 16:15.000
- The final class is in session.
- Oh! This is the best day of my life!

16:21.560 --> 16:23.320
[Amy] Horrible habit.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.160
[Dylan] Just checking you're okay.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.400
[Amy] Even after what I said?
[Dylan] Yeah.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.400
[scoffs] God, you really are a nice guy.
Not my type at all.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.480
Kidding.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.480
But I don't know. The timing and...

16:37.560 --> 16:40.560
I don't think you and me are gonna work.
What with Evie and stuff.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.440
Yeah, it's okay.
I know this isn't going anywhere.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.560
And... Evie's a friend.

16:45.640 --> 16:49.600
Well, she's not quite a friend,
but she's Luke's best friend.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.920
I don't want to mess with that.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.120
You should be her friend.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.120
She's just as annoying as you
and about the same sort of things.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.440
Don't know about that.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.680
Look, I'm gonna get on a train.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.720
I think my work here is done.
I've done a spectacular job as usual.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.920
Do you not want to...
say goodbye to her?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.480
Trust me, this is better for everyone.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.839
- I'll call her later.
- Okay.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.480
Will you do me a favor?

17:11.560 --> 17:15.680
I know you probably will anyway,
but will you be extra nice to her?

17:15.760 --> 17:18.520
She's having a shitty time.
Her and Dad were close.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.960
Hey! [Whistles]
Jerry Garcia.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.600
I can sell these to my man in Belgium
for three grand tomorrow,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.200
but I'm lazy and I dislike
dealing with the post office.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.280
You don't know the first thing
about Belgium.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.800
Their monarch is King Philippe,
population 11 million,

17:38.880 --> 17:41.040
they speak Flemish and Walloon.
That Belgium?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.440
Someone's been reading Wikipedia.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.720
Oh, am I online right now?
Am I browsing?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.520
- Am I...
- Angus, heel.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.880
- I'll give you a grand.
- Sold!

17:47.960 --> 17:50.600
- Two and a half.
- Sold for £2,500 and not a penny less!

17:50.680 --> 17:52.200
- Two. Or I'll walk.
- Deal.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.400
What?

17:55.600 --> 17:58.400
Call me.
If you get another Al Williams.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
Who's Al Williams?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.200
- Did we have one?
- We must have.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.520
Well, whoever he was,
he was worth quite a lot of money.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.000
- [both chuckle]
- Yeah!

18:08.080 --> 18:10.040
I'm sorry that I slept with Amy.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.400
I can't talk about this now.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.120
No, wait, hear me out!
Hear me out, okay?

18:13.200 --> 18:16.000
Erm, I can see that this is
a difficult day for you,

18:16.080 --> 18:19.680
with selling your dad's stuff
and I haven't exactly helped anyway.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.920
What I'm trying to say is I think
you feel things deeper than you let on,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.320
but I like that about you.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.000
I think in all likelihood
you're probably an excellent person and...

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
[inhales sharply]
I want to be your friend.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.840
- Look, Dylan...
- I'm not taking no for an answer on this.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.800
And I don't even expect you
to like me anytime soon,

18:36.880 --> 18:40.680
but I'm giving you notice
that I'm going to be your friend.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.840
Okay.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.200
[Luke laughing]

18:48.280 --> 18:49.960
- Two thousand pounds!
- What?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.600
You made two grand for the records!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.480
Oh, my God! That's amazing!

18:53.560 --> 18:55.040
- [all laughing]
- [Evie squeals] Yes!

18:55.120 --> 18:57.560
Angus! I thought it was you.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.440
- I've got something here you'll love.
- Not now, Ronnie.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.600
She's a Diamond-issue Esmeralda.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.000
Jesus.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.000
What are you asking for her, guy?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.040
- £80?
- Ooh, she's a very fine example.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.840
We'll take her.
You've earned it.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.080
Thank you.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.360
[exclaims]

19:21.480 --> 19:23.240
This must honestly go no further.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.760
Okay?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.800
[all laughing]

19:32.600 --> 19:33.880
Er, Dylan.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.840
We are looking for a flatmate.
Do you need a room?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.680
Yes. Yes.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.920
Please! Would that be okay?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.720
- Yep.
- Yes, this is gonna be so special!

19:43.800 --> 19:45.600
[chuckling] Shotgun!

19:45.680 --> 19:47.280
[Angus] No, no, no, no!

19:47.360 --> 19:49.720
Just one thing, sorry.
Do you mind if I get the jacket back?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.880
It's just... It was my dad's favorite
and it's freaking me out a bit.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Here you go. Yeah.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.560
Thanks.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.360
Okay. Well, erm... welcome aboard.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.720
[Angus] No, no, not upside down.
I get sick, I get sick! I get sick.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.600
[birds chirping]

20:11.800 --> 20:13.360
[vocalizing]

20:13.440 --> 20:16.000
There she is. Behold, baby.
What do you think?

20:16.080 --> 20:17.480
- Pretty great.
- Check this out.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.920
Yeah, get yourself on that,
check out that plumage.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.680
[both grunting]

21:01.840 --> 21:03.560
How was Amy when you spoke to her?

21:03.640 --> 21:06.120
- You could try calling her.
- Don't you start.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.560
Anyway, she's good.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.160
Her boyfriend sounds nice.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.880
Mmm, she seems to have developed
quite a thing for nice guys.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
I blame you for that.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.520
It was like you were some sort of
gateway drug or something. [Laughs]

21:20.200 --> 21:23.120
All right, I've gotta go see Abigail.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.200
Cool.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.680
So, should we buy them some drinks?

21:35.760 --> 21:38.360
No, no, no. Nobody likes that.
It makes them feel obligated.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.000
But don't we want them to feel obligated

21:40.080 --> 21:41.280
so they'll come and talk to us?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.560
Yeah, they might talk to us.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.520
They might also resent
the whole encounter.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.280
You're trying to buy them, which is fine,

21:46.360 --> 21:48.800
but if that's your gig,
be honest about it and call a hooker.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.880
Here's a better move.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.160
Joss, my good man.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.240
Could you please ask
those two ladies over there

21:53.320 --> 21:56.480
if they would like to buy us
a couple of martinis?

21:56.560 --> 21:58.360
And if they'd like
to get themselves a pair,

21:58.440 --> 22:00.360
we'd, of course, be happy to join them.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.440
[laughing]

22:05.520 --> 22:07.440
Are they laughing with us or at us?

22:07.520 --> 22:09.120
Relax, it's charming.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.640
[Angus chuckles]
Oh, this is exciting.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.480
God. I feel alive again.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.200
So what now?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.640
Er, next...

22:21.440 --> 22:23.240
I'm sorry, dude. I can't do this.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.280
What? Wait!

22:25.360 --> 22:27.800
- No, I can't do this on my own.
- I'm sorry, Angus.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.920
Er, turns out Angus has
the staying power after all,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.120
so I'm gonna hit the sack.
I'm not really feeling it tonight, okay?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.480
Night then.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.200
Mmm, how's it going, stud?

22:48.280 --> 22:49.840
Er, can I borrow some money?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.720
I need to pay for four martinis.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.120
Hey.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.360
[band playing folk music]

23:10.680 --> 23:12.560
Whoo! [Laughs]

23:14.440 --> 23:16.560
- Do you want to dance?
- Yep, er...

23:17.600 --> 23:19.800
In a minute... definitely.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.320
You're not one for rushing, are you?

23:22.400 --> 23:25.000
Just... turn things over.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.640
- Do I?
- You know you do.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.080
I can see it.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.440
Weighing things up.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.400
To drink or to dance?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.560
I used to be more of a headless chicken.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.000
- How did you cross the road?
- You have to really want it.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.960
You know, you run under enough trucks
and you get there by accident.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.840
So then...

23:44.920 --> 23:47.320
drink or dance?

23:48.880 --> 23:51.040
I would love to dance with you.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.840
I win!

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
