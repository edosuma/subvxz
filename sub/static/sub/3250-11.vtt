it is. I've just, I have to see.

Guys, tea over here.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.679
If it's any consolation,
I've met the Weeping Angels.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.959
So I know how...
In fact, I thought that room was for me.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.359
Joe was right.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.079
Whatever it is in here,
it actually wants to kill us.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.119
Not oppress us or enslave us, kill us!

15:41.600 --> 15:42.599
Listen,

15:44.840 --> 15:47.319
the Doctor's been part of
my life for so long now

15:47.400 --> 15:48.799
and he's never let me down.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.839
Even when I thought he had when
I was a...a kid and he left me,

15:54.400 --> 15:55.399
he came back.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.959
He saved me. (LAUGHS)

15:59.840 --> 16:02.199
And now he's going to save you.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.439
But don't tell him I said that because
the smugness would be terrifying.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.199
Of course, if the Weeping Angels
were meant for me,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.039
then your room is still out there,

16:18.800 --> 16:20.439
somewhere.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.599
Every time the Doctor gets pally with
someone, I have this overwhelming urge

to notify their next of kin.

Sorry, last time I said something
like that, you hit me with your shoe.

What exactly happened to him?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.599
He died.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.679
You are a medical doctor, aren't you?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.879
You haven't just got a degree in
cheese-making or something...

16:50.960 --> 16:54.079
No. Well, yes. Both, actually.
I mean, there is no cause.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.479
All his vital organs simply stopped

16:56.560 --> 16:58.599
as if the simple spark of life,
his loves and hates,

16:58.680 --> 17:00.879
his faiths and fears were just...

17:00.960 --> 17:03.239
(SNIFFING) ...taken.
And this is a cup of tea.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.919
Of course, I'm British.
It's how we cope with trauma.

-That and tutting.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.079

than Howie's CIA theory or mine.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.399
Which is?

17:24.520 --> 17:25.919
This is Jahannam.

You're a Muslim!

Don't be frightened.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.279
You think this is Hell?

The whole '80s hotel thing
took me by surprise, though.

Ah. And all these fears and phobias

Jahannam will play its tricks and there
will be times I want to run and scream,

and that knowledge keeps me sane,

Now, tragic though that is,
this is no time for sentiment.

it may be satisfied
and let the rest of us go.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.719
It might leave us alone now.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.159
Maybe now we'll be safe.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.479
Wait!

28:33.720 --> 28:35.439
Have you found your room yet?

28:36.480 --> 28:37.559
No.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.919
Is that good or bad?

28:42.040 --> 28:43.719
Maybe you're not scared of anything.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.279
Well, after all the time I spent
with you in the Tardis,

28:47.360 --> 28:48.919
what was left to be scared of?

28:50.480 --> 28:52.559
You said that in the past tense.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.639
No, I didn't.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.599
You know,
Howie had been in speech therapy.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.639
He'd just got over this massive stammer.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.119
What an achievement.
I mean, can you imagine?

29:09.240 --> 29:12.279
I'd forgotten not all victories
are about saving the universe.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.679
Rita! Brilliant!

29:25.320 --> 29:27.679
How are you? Not panicking, are you?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.799
Good, good.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.559
Because I'm literally an otter's toenail
away from getting us out of here.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.919
-Why?
-Excellent question.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.799
Excellent question.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.119
Why what?

29:40.240 --> 29:41.679
Why is up to you to save us?

29:41.760 --> 29:44.559
That's quite a God complex
you have there.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.359
DOCTOR: I brought them here.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.559
They'd say it was their choice,

29:51.640 --> 29:54.799
but offer a child a suitcase
full of sweets and they'll take it.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.599
Offer someone all of time and space
and they'll take that, too.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.559
Which is why you shouldn't.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.799
Which is why grown-ups were invented.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.119
-All of time and space, eh?
-Oh, yeah.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.719
And when we get out of this,
I'll show you, too.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.079
I don't know what you're talking about,
but whatever it was,

30:14.160 --> 30:16.199
-I have a feeling you just did it again.
-(CHUCKLES)

30:18.760 --> 30:21.599
Right down to the smallest detail.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.039
Got you, Mr Minotaur.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.399
Praise him.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.319
VOICES: (ECHOING) Praise him.
Praise him. Praise him.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.119
(ECHOING CONTINUES)

31:08.320 --> 31:09.559
Of course.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.679
Who else?

31:33.880 --> 31:36.759
Oh, you beauty! Come on, big fella.
Where are you?

31:38.440 --> 31:40.319
Ah. Ahh...

31:43.760 --> 31:44.799
Rita, where are you going?

31:47.400 --> 31:49.199
(PHONE RINGING)

31:52.600 --> 31:54.039
Come on, come on, come on.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.079
Come on.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.599
(PHONE PICKS UP)

32:03.400 --> 32:04.759
Rita, where are you going?

32:04.840 --> 32:07.519
Can you take the phone
into the corridor? Will it reach?

32:11.360 --> 32:12.799
You started to praise it, didn't you?

32:16.480 --> 32:18.559
Rita, come back, please.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.919
We'll find a way to stop it,
I swear to you.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.239
No, I need to get as far away
from you all as possible.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.959
No, no, no, you don't. The creature
only wants whoever's praising it.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.519
And then you'll put yourself in its way.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.319
I'm coming to get you. Block out the
fear and stay focused on your belief.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.639
The hotel will keep us apart.
I could be 50 miles away by now.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.199
(FAINT GROWLING)

32:36.280 --> 32:38.959
I want you to do me
one last favour, Doctor.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.679
I can feel the rapture approaching
like a wave.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.639
I don't want you to witness this.
I want you to remember me the way I was.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.719
(ROARING)

32:51.640 --> 32:53.799
What's going on? Rita's disappeared.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.399
What is she doing there?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.839
Rita.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.239
Rita, please.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.999
Let me find you.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.559
You stay where you are.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.959
Please, let me be robbed of my faith
in private.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.439
Look, Rita, Rita, go into the room.
Lock the door.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.239
I'm not frightened. I'm blessed, Doctor.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.879
(GROWLING)

33:13.960 --> 33:15.199
I'm at peace.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.319
-I'm going to hang up.
-No, no, no, Rita.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.159
-Goodbye, Doctor.
-Rita!

33:21.240 --> 33:23.999
-Thank you for trying.
-Rita, please! Please!

33:25.560 --> 33:26.599
Please!

33:26.840 --> 33:28.199
(ROARING)

33:54.280 --> 33:55.879

(CRASHING)

34:13.520 --> 34:14.879
(YELLING)

34:24.280 --> 34:25.439
Okay.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.639
He preys on people's fear
and possesses them.

34:30.160 --> 34:33.199
But Rita wasn't afraid.
She was brave and calm.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.479
Maybe it's something to do
with the people,

34:36.560 --> 34:39.159
some connection between the four of you
that will tell me how to fight it.

34:39.240 --> 34:41.999
Yes, you keep saying that,
but you never do.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.759
And while we wait, people keep dying,
and we'll be next!

34:44.840 --> 34:46.279
Look, he'll work it out, he always does.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.319
Just let him riff and move
anything expensive out of his way.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.279
Oh, no.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.719
-Oh, no, no...
-Doctor, what is wrong?

34:56.160 --> 34:57.599
It's not fear.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.519
It's faith.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.799
Not just religious faith.
Faith in something.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.399
Howard believed in conspiracies, that
external forces controlled the world.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.359
Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain
with a horseshoe. He was a gambler.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.719
Gamblers believe in luck, an intangible
force that helps them win or lose.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.119
Gibbis has rejected
any personal autonomy, and he's waiting

35:17.200 --> 35:20.199
for the next batch of invaders
to oppress him and tell him what to do.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.199
They all believe there's something
guiding them, about to save them.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.879
That's what it replaces.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.479
Every time someone was confronted
with their most primal fear,

35:27.560 --> 35:30.399
they fell back on
their most fundamental faith.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.879
And all this time,
I have been telling you to dig deep,

35:37.560 --> 35:39.639
find the thing that keeps you brave.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.999
I made you expose your faith.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.599
Showed them what they needed.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.039
But why us? Why are we here?

35:50.120 --> 35:52.559
It doesn't want you. That's why
it kept showing you a way out.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.999
You're not religious or superstitious,

35:54.080 --> 35:56.439
so there's no faith
for you to fall back on.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.359
It wants her.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.639
Me?

36:09.680 --> 36:12.359
-Why?
-Your faith in me.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.839
That's what brought us here.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.559
But why do they lose their faith
before they die?

36:26.920 --> 36:30.159
And start worshipping...it?

36:30.680 --> 36:33.559
It needs to convert the faith
into a form it can consume.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.799
Faith is an energy,

36:34.880 --> 36:37.919
the specific emotional energy
the creature needs to live.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.279
Which is why, at the end of her note,
Lucy said...

36:40.360 --> 36:41.679
-AMY: "Praise him."
-Exactly.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.959
No.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.399
Oh, please, no.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.039
Doctor, it's happening. It's changing
me. It's changing my thoughts.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.559
I can't save you from this.
There's nothing I can do to stop this.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.599
-What?
-I stole your childhood

37:44.680 --> 37:47.319
and now I've led you by the hand
to your death.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.159
But the worst thing is, I knew.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.279
I knew this would happen.
This is what always happens.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.359
Forget your faith in me.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.239
(BELLOWS)

38:13.880 --> 38:16.359
I took you with me because I was vain.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.759
Because I wanted to be adored.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.119
Look at you.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.279
The glorious Pond,

38:29.240 --> 38:31.199
the girl who waited for me.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.039
I'm not a hero.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.839
I really am just a madman in a box.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.399
And it's time we saw each other
as we really are.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.039
Amy Williams...

39:12.000 --> 39:14.239
it's time to stop waiting.

I severed the food supply,

40:02.520 --> 40:04.399

40:31.720 --> 40:34.599

40:34.920 --> 40:36.359
Or an alien minotaur?

40:37.240 --> 40:39.279
That's not a question
I thought I'd be asking this morning.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.079
I mean, it's both, actually.
Yeah. Here we go.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.399
A distant cousin of the Nimon.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.999
They descend on planets and set
themselves up as gods to be worshipped,

40:49.520 --> 40:52.439
which is fine until the inhabitants
get all secular

40:52.520 --> 40:55.159
and advanced enough
to build bunkers, prisons.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.639
RORY: Correction.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.279
-Prisons in space.
-AMY: Where are the guards?

41:00.360 --> 41:03.159
No need for any. It's all automated.
It drifts through space,

41:04.120 --> 41:05.599
snatching people with belief systems,

41:05.680 --> 41:07.919
and converts their faith into food
for the creature.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.199
See that planet there?

41:10.880 --> 41:12.839
-Which one?
-The grey one, there.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.519
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's where I'm from.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.159
It didn't want just me.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.879
So, you must believe in some god
or someone

41:18.960 --> 41:20.799
or they'd have shown you the door, too.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.119
So what do Time Lords pray to?

41:25.800 --> 41:29.599
According to the in-flight recorder,
the programme developed glitches.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.399
Got stuck on the same setting.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.519

Inside lives a goblin

Nope. Real Earth. Real house.
Real door keys.

-The car, too?

43:05.120 --> 43:07.679
That...that's my favourite car.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.119
How did you know
that was my favourite car?

43:09.200 --> 43:11.879
You showed me a picture of it once
and said, "That's my favourite car."

(BOTH LAUGHING)

43:13.240 --> 43:15.759
Rory, can you give us two minutes?

43:15.840 --> 43:17.839
Two minutes.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.359
She'll say that we can't accept it
because it's too extravagant

43:20.440 --> 43:22.439
and we'll always feel
a crippling sense of obligation.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.799
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

43:31.560 --> 43:32.679
Hey.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.319
So...

43:39.040 --> 43:40.799
You're leaving, aren't you?

43:42.040 --> 43:43.839
You haven't seen the last of me.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.959
Bad Penny is my middle name.

43:47.040 --> 43:50.519
Seriously, the looks I get
when I fill in a form, it's...

43:51.400 --> 43:52.519
Why now?

43:55.960 --> 43:58.519
Because you're still breathing.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.039
Well, I think
this is about the washing up.

44:10.040 --> 44:13.199
Oh, you're right. There's still
heaps of stuff out there to look at.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.959
Do you know, there's a planet

44:15.200 --> 44:18.759
whose name literally translates
as "Volatile Sadness"?

44:23.400 --> 44:26.999
Or maybe there's a bigger, scarier
adventure waiting for you in there.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.559
Even so, it can't happen like this.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.959
After everything we've been through,
Doctor,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.359
everything,

44:41.480 --> 44:45.799
you can't just drop me off at my house
and say goodbye like we've shared a cab.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.119
And what's the alternative?
Me standing over your grave?

44:52.440 --> 44:55.799
Over your broken body? Over Rory's body?

45:21.080 --> 45:24.839
If you bump into my daughter,
tell her to visit her old mum sometime.

What's he doing?

46:24.680 --> 46:26.679
He's saving us.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.279
Hello, Craig. I'm back.

47:07.480 --> 47:10.359
-What are you here for?
-I'm the Doctor. I work in a shop now.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.479
OWENS: You noticed something
and you're investigating it,

47:12.560 --> 47:14.999
and because it's you,
it's going to be dangerous and alien.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.439
What is that?

47:16.920 --> 47:17.959
Help me!

47:19.040 --> 47:20.159
No!

47:20.560 --> 47:21.719
-Doctor!
-Craig!

47:24.160 --> 47:25.199
