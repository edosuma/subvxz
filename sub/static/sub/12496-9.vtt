Thank you.

Oh, that's nice. Oh.

You know, it's really great to--

00:34.250 --> 00:38.667
- Hey, shut up and feed us!

00:38.709 --> 00:39.750
- Just a moment, sir.

00:39.792 --> 00:43.041

Yes. Yes.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.875
I know, I know.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.166
- All right,

01:08.208 --> 01:09.083
everybody get up here

01:09.125 --> 01:14.000
and taste the Christmas.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.542
- Here, Kid, put this on.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.375
- Ew. I don't want

01:16.583 --> 01:18.375
to wear a hair net.

01:18.417 --> 01:19.667
- You have to wear one.

01:19.709 --> 01:20.417
You're serving food.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.709
It's city law.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.166
- All right.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.792
But I'm doing this begrudgingly.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.875
Hey, how come

01:32.917 --> 01:34.583
you're not wearing a hair net?

01:34.625 --> 01:38.250
- [ chuckles ] Lots of reasons.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.166
First, I'm Captain Man.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.959
Second, I'm very handsome

01:43.000 --> 01:45.583
and I do not wear hair nets.

01:45.625 --> 01:46.792
- Hey, are these reindeer eggs

01:46.834 --> 01:48.709
locally sourced?

01:48.750 --> 01:50.500
- I, I don't know.

01:50.542 --> 01:51.625
- Well, I won't eat eggs

01:51.667 --> 01:53.458
unless they're locally sourced.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.625
- Okay, good for you.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.250
- Hey, why aren't you wearing

01:57.291 --> 01:58.667
a hair net?

01:58.709 --> 02:00.709
- Lots of reasons. One...

02:00.750 --> 02:03.166
- Shut up.

02:03.208 --> 02:04.166
- You know, I'm guessing

02:04.208 --> 02:05.083
you don't get invited

02:05.125 --> 02:07.583
to a lot of parties.

02:10.000 --> 02:10.959
- Hey, Captain Man,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Captain Man.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.667
- Ah, yes, Vice Mayor Willard.

02:13.709 --> 02:14.625
- Yeah, hi.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.458
There's a reporter here

02:15.500 --> 02:16.875
from KLVY News,

02:16.917 --> 02:17.792
she wants to do

02:17.834 --> 02:18.625

02:18.667 --> 02:19.959

02:20.000 --> 02:20.750
is it?

02:20.792 --> 02:21.667
- Yeah, I believe it is.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.375
- Ah, crud. Hey, listen--

- No, no, please don't, arg.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.625
- What's the problem?

02:28.667 --> 02:29.625
- I took this reporter

02:29.667 --> 02:31.083
out on a date last week

02:31.125 --> 02:33.667
and I told her I'd text her

02:31.125 --> 02:33.667
the next day and I didn't.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.792
- And here's Captain Man.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.125
- Yeah, I see him.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.458
- Vice mayor. Vice mayor.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.834
- Look, I was going

02:40.875 --> 02:41.917
to text you.

02:41.959 --> 02:44.834
- But you didn't.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.125

02:51.792 --> 02:55.542

02:58.291 --> 02:59.667
if you went on a date

02:59.709 --> 03:00.625

03:00.667 --> 03:02.709
- Oh, here it comes.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.625
- And you promised to text

03:04.667 --> 03:06.166
the girl the next day,

03:06.208 --> 03:07.917
what would you do?

03:07.959 --> 03:10.834
- Can you not do this?

03:10.875 --> 03:14.458
- I, I would text the girl.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.583
- All right, all right, Evelyn,

03:15.625 --> 03:16.625
I'm texting you, all right?

03:16.667 --> 03:18.083
I'm texting you right now.

03:18.125 --> 03:21.542
And send.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
Oh, wait,

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
that's a different Evelyn.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.709
- Are you serious?

03:27.208 --> 03:28.667
Come on, let's just

03:27.208 --> 03:28.667
go serve the food.

- Yeah, all right.

03:29.458 --> 03:30.417
- All right.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.041
- There he is, right there.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.375
- Wait, you mean Captain Man?

03:34.417 --> 03:35.458
- That's right. Look at him.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.625
- Oh, come on.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.500
- Don't give me that.

A law is a law is a law.

03:39.834 --> 03:40.917
Do your duty.

You don't have

03:40.959 --> 03:42.291
to tell me about my duty.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.667
Are you refusing

03:42.333 --> 03:43.667
to do your duty?

03:43.709 --> 03:44.583
- Listen, sir.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.667

- Hello, ma'am.

Would you like some grits?

They're freshly stirred.

- Everyone!

Everyone, may I have

03:55.291 --> 03:57.542
your attention?

03:57.583 --> 03:59.250
As Swellview's Chief of Police,

03:59.291 --> 04:00.583
I came here this morning

04:00.625 --> 04:02.667
to thank Captain Man

04:00.625 --> 04:02.667

for this wonderful

04:03.583 --> 04:05.834

04:08.667 --> 04:10.166
Which makes what I must do now

04:10.208 --> 04:12.500
very difficult.

04:16.542 --> 04:17.166
- What's...

04:17.208 --> 04:18.291
what's going on?

04:18.333 --> 04:19.458
- I'm very sorry Captain Man,

04:19.500 --> 04:21.000
but you're under arrest.

[ crowd gasping ]

04:25.125 --> 04:26.583
- Under arrest?

04:26.625 --> 04:28.208
- Why am I being arrested?

04:28.250 --> 04:29.166
- Because it's illegal

04:29.208 --> 04:29.959
for you to serve food

04:30.000 --> 04:30.792
to the public

04:30.834 --> 04:31.834
without wearing a hair net.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.875
- I told you

04:31.875 --> 04:33.875
to put on a hair net.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.458
- Will you be qu--

04:35.500 --> 04:36.583
You're seriously arresting me

04:36.625 --> 04:38.166
for not wearing a hair net?

04:38.208 --> 04:39.250
- I have to.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.208
It's a class three misdemeanor.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.166
- Seriously?

04:44.208 --> 04:46.083
Seriously?

04:46.125 --> 04:47.959
Seriously?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.583
Seriously?

04:52.667 --> 04:55.208
- Seriously?

04:55.250 --> 04:58.333
- Please stop saying seriously.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.083
- It all just kind of happened.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.542
- My dad was

05:09.125 --> 05:11.542
an irresponsible scientist.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.083
- I wanted an after-school job.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.458
- And by accident,

05:14.500 --> 05:16.208
he made me indestructible.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.834
Ah!

05:17.875 --> 05:20.083
- I went into this crazy store

05:17.875 --> 05:20.083
and met

05:20.125 --> 05:21.583
a pretty interesting guy.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.875
- I'm going to blow your mind.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.000
Now I protect

05:24.041 --> 05:25.667
the good citizens of Swellview.

05:25.709 --> 05:26.542
who call me...

05:26.583 --> 05:27.625
- He turned out to be...

05:27.667 --> 05:28.667
- You know the name.

05:28.709 --> 05:29.625
- Captain Man!

05:29.667 --> 05:30.750
- That's right, Henry.

05:30.792 --> 05:31.667
In time, I realized that

05:31.709 --> 05:33.208
being a superhero

05:33.250 --> 05:35.208
is a lot to handle alone.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.208
- He wanted some help.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.458
- I needed a sidekick.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.583
- I, Henry Hart...

05:38.625 --> 05:39.667
- Pledge to never ever ever

05:39.709 --> 05:40.625
tell anyone...

05:40.667 --> 05:41.458
- That I'm Captain Man's

05:41.500 --> 05:42.667
secret sidekick.

05:42.709 --> 05:43.583
- It is done.

05:43.625 --> 05:44.667
- Now we blow bubbles.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.041
- And fight crime.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.250
- Feels good.

06:01.917 --> 06:02.625
- Call it.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.667
- Up the tube!

06:04.709 --> 06:06.166
Oh, my boot.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.500
- Ha!

06:12.667 --> 06:13.583
- Well, why didn't you

06:13.625 --> 06:15.041
make him wear a hair net?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.917
- I tried.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.625
You know how Ray is

06:16.959 --> 06:19.625
about his Captain Man hair.

06:19.667 --> 06:20.625
- Well, we can't let Ray

06:20.667 --> 06:21.792
spend Christmas in jail

06:21.834 --> 06:22.875
all alone.

06:22.917 --> 06:23.709
- How are we supposed

06:23.750 --> 06:24.500
to get him out?

06:24.542 --> 06:26.917
- I don't know.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.917
[ sighs ]

06:28.959 --> 06:29.792
You can't put

06:29.834 --> 06:32.875
two gold balls together.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.125
- Huh?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.500
- You got to go, gold ball,

06:35.542 --> 06:37.250
red ball, gold ball, red ball.

06:37.291 --> 06:38.792
- I can totally

06:37.291 --> 06:38.792
put two gold balls together.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.000
- No, you can't.

06:40.041 --> 06:43.834
- Why not?

06:40.041 --> 06:43.834
What is this, the 1950s?

06:43.875 --> 06:45.291
- Well, guys, I had to look

06:45.333 --> 06:46.417
for two hours,

06:46.458 --> 06:47.709
but check out what Daddy

06:47.750 --> 06:48.709
found in the attic.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.000
- Oh, honey, please, no, no.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.750
- Oh my gosh, Dad,

06:50.041 --> 06:51.750
are you serious?

06:51.792 --> 06:52.917
- Nunh-uh, stop that.

06:52.959 --> 06:54.166
My parents paid a lot of money

06:54.208 --> 06:55.458
for these handbells

06:55.500 --> 06:57.333
and the least we can do

06:55.500 --> 06:57.333
is play them as a family

06:57.375 --> 06:59.625
once a year on Christmas.

06:59.667 --> 07:00.834
- Mom?

06:59.667 --> 07:00.834
- Honey, I know you

07:00.875 --> 07:01.959
like the handbells,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.625
but the rest of us don't--

07:05.667 --> 07:07.125
- Look, Dad, we played

07:07.166 --> 07:08.083
the bells last year.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.125
Can't we skip one year

07:09.166 --> 07:09.709
and not--

07:09.750 --> 07:11.041
- Hey.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.000
Hey, you have to listen

07:11.083 --> 07:13.000
to what we're all saying.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.250
If we don't want

07:13.041 --> 07:14.250
to play the bells,

07:14.291 --> 07:15.583
you can't just--

07:15.625 --> 07:17.792
All right.

07:17.834 --> 07:21.417
- Okay. Okay. I am really mad.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.083
- Dude, I told you,

07:23.125 --> 07:24.667
the Santa Claus at the mall

07:24.709 --> 07:27.208
isn't going to let a kid

07:24.709 --> 07:27.208
your size sit on his lap.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.625
- I know.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.375
I've accepted that.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.500
- Then what are you

07:30.417 --> 07:32.500
mad about now?

07:32.542 --> 07:34.041
- Has no one here heard

07:34.083 --> 07:35.750
that Captain Man is in jail?

07:35.792 --> 07:36.917
- Yeah, we heard.

07:36.959 --> 07:38.417
- Well, do you guys know why

07:38.458 --> 07:39.625
Captain Man is in jail?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.667
- Yeah, it's because

07:40.709 --> 07:42.500
of some stupid hair net law.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.583
- Yeah, well you want to hear

07:43.625 --> 07:44.625
some other stupid laws

07:44.667 --> 07:46.125

07:46.166 --> 07:48.250
Look at these.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.917
- What are those books?

07:49.959 --> 07:52.125
- It's the Swellview

07:49.959 --> 07:52.125
Book of Laws and Ordinances.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.375
- I want to play the handbells.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.542
- Later.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.291
- Later.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.583
It's always later.

How stupid is that?

08:13.667 --> 08:14.750
- Okay, everyone, now,

08:14.792 --> 08:16.083
read the laws I've highlighted

08:49.750 --> 08:50.875
- Well, it should.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.250
- Agreed.

- Yeah, it should.

And to make my point,

09:01.583 --> 09:02.792
I'm going down to City Hall

- Question.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.083
- Yeah?

09:07.125 --> 09:09.375
- Why?

09:09.417 --> 09:10.500
- Because they won't dare

09:10.542 --> 09:12.250
put a kid in jail on Christmas.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.250
And then they'll have

09:12.291 --> 09:14.250
to let Captain Man out, too.

Now, I'm going down there

We're all mad that Captain Man

for breaking some stupid law

11:35.542 --> 11:36.500
about hair nets.

- What? But I'm just a child.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.125
- Doesn't matter.

- But I was only doing this

12:53.166 --> 12:55.583
- Wait, why am I under arrest?

- You don't have a plan?

15:05.792 --> 15:07.250
It's not your fault.
