WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:07.050
- Sir, I'd like to talk to you
about the new task force

00:07.094 --> 00:08.312
you're on the hiring
committee for.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.271
- The Special Tactical
Operations and Auxiliary

00:10.314 --> 00:12.012
Strategic Response
Citywide Emergency

00:12.055 --> 00:13.491
Investigative Unit
for Emergency Operations?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.450
You know,
I had a hand in naming it.

00:15.493 --> 00:18.061
- And it's great, although you
might wanna try shortening it,

00:18.105 --> 00:19.193
maybe using a cool acronym.

00:19.236 --> 00:22.500
- So the
S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.?

00:22.544 --> 00:23.980
Hm, you're right.
That is cool.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.896
- Sure, anyways, I know some
of the best cops in the city

00:26.939 --> 00:28.376
are gonna be
on that task force,

00:28.419 --> 00:29.638
and I would appreciate it
if you'd consider me for it.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.161
Here's my résumé.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.643
And I thought it would be fun
if I rapped it.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.079
But then I realized that would
be a terrible idea,

00:36.123 --> 00:37.254
so I just wrote it down
normally.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.821
It'll probably
rhyme a lot on accident.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.083
Try not to focus on that.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.391
- "Jake Peralta is age 39,
but professionally,

00:43.434 --> 00:45.654
he's still in his prime..."

00:45.697 --> 00:48.874
- "If you ask me,
he's New York's fine...est.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.354
Charles enters."

00:50.398 --> 00:52.139
- ♪ Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat,
Chucky B with the burner ♪

00:52.182 --> 00:53.488
♪ Raining hot fire!

00:53.531 --> 00:55.055
- Charles, it's not a rap.
It never was.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.099
Everyone's professional here.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.883
Not the lyrics
we discussed either.

00:57.927 --> 01:00.582
Anyways, sir, I really think
that I deserve this task force.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.106
My clearance rate puts me
in the top 2% of all NYPD det--

01:03.150 --> 01:04.760
- I am aware of your
qualifications, Peralta,

01:04.803 --> 01:06.501
but I'm only allowed
to recommend one name

01:06.544 --> 01:08.590
for the
S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.374
- And you don't think the
acronym's just a little clunky?

01:10.418 --> 01:11.810
- Oh, no, it's quite catchy.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.899
- Look, I really feel like
I've got what it takes.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.118
I'm experienced,
I'm hardworking,

01:15.162 --> 01:16.728
and I'm unflappable
in the face of--

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
Oh, my God!
What was that?

01:40.187 --> 01:42.580
- Scully, are you hurt?

01:42.624 --> 01:44.278
Is that blood?
- It's glitter.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.714
- There was a box
on Jake's desk.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.803
I opened it,
and it just exploded.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.065
I can't feel my face.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.240
- And, not to be rude,

01:50.284 --> 01:52.242
but is that something
you can normally feel?

01:52.286 --> 01:54.766
- Oh, right.
I guess I'm fine.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.333
- Jeffords,
evacuate the precinct.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.292
I'll contact the bomb squad.
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.467
I think this actually
might have been

01:59.510 --> 02:00.729
a prank that malfunctioned.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.513
Look, the box
was connected to a tank

02:02.557 --> 02:03.949
of compressed air
under the desk.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.429
It was supposed to shoot
glitter at whoever opened it,

02:05.473 --> 02:07.388
but something must have clogged
the pressure release valve,

02:07.431 --> 02:08.737
and the tank exploded.
- Wow.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.434
The silver lining
is no one got hurt.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
- And the lead lining
is that this prank

02:12.480 --> 02:14.090
caused significant property
damage in the precinct.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.527
- Fair point, but we do shatter
a lot of glass around here.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.138
Either it's Rosa
who's disappointed

02:18.181 --> 02:19.269
in her Buzzfeed results...

02:19.313 --> 02:21.837
- I am not a Blanche.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.970
- Or Charles
trying to bro out...

02:25.014 --> 02:27.712
- Hut, think fast, dude.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.540
- Or just Terry
gently shutting a window

02:29.584 --> 02:31.412
and forgetting
how strong he is.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.503
- And look at this.
Evidence was compromised.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.158
- Oh no, the shirt from
the Dekalb Street murder.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.768
- That's the only
hard evidence we have.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.466
ADA Green's already mad
we didn't find anything else.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.815
- Why is this on your desk,
Peralta?

02:43.859 --> 02:46.470
- I logged it out for trial,
but Officer Howard

02:46.514 --> 02:48.211
is the one who got it
from the evidence locker.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.082
Let's blame him.
He's always up to no good.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.345
- What?
You don't even know me.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.868
- Yes, I do.
- Then what's my last name?

02:53.999 --> 02:55.436
- I thought it was Howard.

02:55.479 --> 02:58.090
- It's Booth.
My name is Howard Booth.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.483
- Okay, fine,
but just so you know,

02:59.527 --> 03:01.268
the only thing I'm gonna
remember from this interaction

03:01.311 --> 03:02.747
is that you put me
on the spot, so...

03:02.791 --> 03:04.401
- Sir,
I know this is important,

03:04.445 --> 03:05.750
but I kinda gotta go.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.188
Cagney and Lacey's
recorder concert's

03:08.231 --> 03:09.624
in an hour
and I promised that I--

03:09.667 --> 03:10.799
- No one leaves
until the culprit

03:10.842 --> 03:11.930
is brought to justice.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.323
- But they're playing
"Uptown Funk."

03:13.367 --> 03:14.890
- I wouldn't care if
they were playing actual music.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.196
Whoever did this was obviously

03:16.239 --> 03:18.328
someone Peralta pranked
seeking revenge.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.634
Who are his recent victims?

03:20.983 --> 03:23.507
- I'm sorry,
but I'm the Prankmaster General

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
and I take that role
very seriously.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.381
- Look at this.
There's a note.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.253
It says, "Gotcha back, babe."
It was Amy.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.602
Who else would
call Jake "babe"?

03:31.646 --> 03:33.343
- Charles went through
that year-long phase

03:33.387 --> 03:34.301
where he called
everybody "babe."

03:34.344 --> 03:35.302
- Uh-huh.
- I forget.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.390
Did you guys like that?

03:36.433 --> 03:37.434
No.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.609
- I still think it was Amy.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.350
- Obviously I'm being framed,

03:40.394 --> 03:42.265
probably by whomever
keeps accusing me.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.701
- No one's asking
the obvious question.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.530
Why did Scully open a package
on Peralta's desk?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.053
Perhaps he was
setting up the prank,

03:48.097 --> 03:49.098
and it blew up
in his face.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.493
- No, I just saw a box
and I thought,

03:52.536 --> 03:54.277
"Oh, cookies come in boxes."

03:55.800 --> 03:58.325
- I bet it wasn't anyone
in this squad.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.717
- That's exactly what
a guilty person would say.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.197
- So in order to prove
my innocence,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.285
I just need to start
pointing fingers?

04:02.329 --> 04:03.373
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.679
- Fine, it was Amy.
- Really?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.724
Because the "Babe" thing
screams you, Charles.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.727
- Oh, you wanna hear screaming?
It was Amy!

04:09.771 --> 04:12.252
- Somebody confess!

04:14.558 --> 04:16.256
Well, well, well.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.822
What do we have here?

04:17.866 --> 04:20.085
It appears a crime
has been committed,

04:20.129 --> 04:22.174
and no one will confess.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.220
- Doing a German accent?
- I was going for Belgian,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.352
Like in "Murder on
the Orient Express."

04:25.395 --> 04:26.483
- You sound like a Nazi.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.571
- Okay, not a great note
to hear.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.746
I'll just use my normal voice.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.182
The point is a crime
has been committed,

04:30.226 --> 04:31.575
and someone in this room
did it.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.448
There are seven suspects
all with means and motive.

04:34.491 --> 04:37.059
It appears what we have
is a classic whodunit.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.714
- The phrase "whodunit"
is a grammatical abomination.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.673
Please use the proper term,
a "who has done this."

04:42.717 --> 04:45.372
- I will not, however,
in order to solve this case,

04:45.415 --> 04:47.765
we need the very finest
of detectives,

04:47.809 --> 04:51.595
one with a unique set
of skills, someone named--

04:51.639 --> 04:54.076
- Dillman!
I'll call Dillman!

04:56.165 --> 04:57.122
- Who?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.875
- I hear you need some help
with a "who has done this."

05:10.919 --> 05:13.138
- Squad,
meet detective Frank Dillman

05:13.182 --> 05:14.575
of the San Francisco PD.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.011
He is in town,
and we were supposed

05:16.054 --> 05:17.621
to have lunch tomorrow,
but I asked him to come down

05:17.665 --> 05:19.493
because I need an objective
set of eyes on this.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.233
- I can be objective.
- Then tell me.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.931
How do I look today?
- Normal?

05:22.974 --> 05:23.801
- No.
Dillman?

05:23.845 --> 05:24.933
- Bloated.
- Thank you.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.369
Dillman is the single
best detective

05:26.413 --> 05:27.675
I have ever worked with.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.329
Sadly, he was unjustly fired
for investigating

05:29.372 --> 05:31.331
corruption in the NYPD.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.636
He hated dirty cops so much

05:32.680 --> 05:34.812
they used to call him
Mr. Clean.

05:34.856 --> 05:35.987
- Uh-huh, I'm sure
that's the only reason

05:36.031 --> 05:37.293
they called him that.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.686
- Because I'm bald?
You think that's funny?

05:38.729 --> 05:41.036
I started shaving my head
20 years ago in solidarity

05:41.079 --> 05:43.430
with my mother who was
undergoing chemotherapy.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.432
- Oh, look, I'm so sorry--

05:45.475 --> 05:46.607
- I'm obviously lying.

05:46.650 --> 05:47.738
It's classic
male pattern baldness.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.653
But now,
based on your reaction,

05:49.697 --> 05:52.352
I know every single thing
about you as a person.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.744
- That can't be true.
- It is.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.833
You're cooked.
- All right, let's get started.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.531
I want written statements
from every witness--

05:57.574 --> 06:00.011
personnel files
for the entire squad.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.405
Of course, I need to have
this desk dusted for prints,

06:02.449 --> 06:04.451
see if we get a hit
on the AFI system.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.974
Somebody could maybe get rid
of those pigeons.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.411
And, of course, I'll need
to see any surveillance video.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.021
- Unfortunately,
this area's a blind spot.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.849
The camera that covers it
broke two weeks ago,

06:11.893 --> 06:13.242
and it hasn't been fixed yet.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.070
- Really don't want me
to see that security footage,

06:15.113 --> 06:16.463
do you, Lieutenant?

06:16.506 --> 06:19.466
Hm, I wonder why.
- I was just stating the facts.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.945
I didn't do anything
to the camera.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.469
- I never thought you did,
but now I know

06:22.512 --> 06:24.035
every single thing
about you as a person.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.646
- Everyone back off.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.387
Dillman has the scene.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.607
- Man, this sucks.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.000
This case would have been
the perfect chance for you

06:32.043 --> 06:34.132
to prove to Holt that you
deserve that task force.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.526
- Yeah.
Maybe it still is.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.267
Holt thinks Dillman's
the best detective

06:38.310 --> 06:39.616
he's ever worked with,
so what happens

06:39.660 --> 06:40.965
if I solve the case before him?

06:41.009 --> 06:42.880
Then I become the best
detective Holt has ever

06:42.924 --> 06:44.969
worked with, and he has
to give me the task force.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.318
Dillman thinks he knows
everything about me

06:46.362 --> 06:49.060
as a person, but there's
one thing he doesn't know.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.322
I'm about to take him down--

06:50.366 --> 06:51.628
oh, my God,
he's staring right at us.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.238
Quick, pretend like
I was saying something else.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.153
- Yes, Jake, you were young
when you lost your virginity.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.416
- Thank you, Charles!

06:59.027 --> 07:01.638
- The DA's office called.
Greene is furious.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.292
He thinks he may have to drop
all charges in the Dekalb case.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.468
Whoever did this is facing
a massive suspension,

07:05.512 --> 07:06.991
and there's no use hiding

07:07.035 --> 07:08.689
because Dillman
will smoke you out.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.213
- Right, but is there any way
he could hurry it up?

07:11.256 --> 07:13.389
So far it's just been a lot
of silent pacing.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478
- Would you ask a heart surgeon
to hurry it up?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.306
- I mean, I would if he was
just walking around a room.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.742
- Okay, here's what we know.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.658
The glitter bomb was placed
between 12:20 and 12:55.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.400
All the suspects say
they were at lunch

07:24.444 --> 07:26.141
and have an alibi
for that time,

07:26.184 --> 07:28.578
which means
one of you is lying.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.971
- It was Terry.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.668
Thanks for coming by, Dill,
but I got it from here.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.018
- You see, Terrence,
I couldn't help but notice

07:34.062 --> 07:35.585
you're not wearing
suspenders today--

07:35.629 --> 07:38.893
odd, considering suspenders
are your entire personality.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.503
- Seems a little reductive.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.939
I had a rough childhood,

07:41.983 --> 07:43.419
but I lifted myself up
through arts and athletics--

07:43.463 --> 07:45.160
-Ah-buh-buh-buhp.
You're the suspenders guy.

07:45.203 --> 07:48.293
Something felt fishy,
so Jakey went fishing,

07:48.337 --> 07:49.904
and I caught me a fat one.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.427
And look at that--

07:51.471 --> 07:54.169
Terry's suspenders
stuffed into his desk drawer,

07:54.212 --> 07:57.085
and there's glitter on them--
red glitter.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.044
Feels like that deserved
an audible gasp.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.306
- Thank you, Charles.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.917
You got messy
setting up the prank.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.179
You didn't want
anyone to see.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.659
You put the suspenders
in your desk drawer.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.225
Case closed.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.618
- Did you put that folder there
just so you could close it?

08:08.662 --> 08:09.837
- Yes, Rosa, obviously.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.186
- I didn't do anything.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.274
- Well, if you didn't
do anything,

08:12.317 --> 08:13.667
how come the case is closed?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.842
- It's not.
- Hm?

08:14.885 --> 08:16.365
- The glitter
on Jeffords' suspenders

08:16.408 --> 08:19.324
is type 9A round red glitter
while the bomb spewed

08:19.368 --> 08:21.544
type 9C round red glitter,
but then I suppose

08:21.588 --> 08:23.894
all round red glitter
looks the same to you.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.983
- No.
I know the difference.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.769
One is bigger?
- Shinier.

08:28.812 --> 08:29.987
- Ah.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.249
- The number refers
to the size.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.816
The letter refers
to its reflective qualities.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.122
- Seems like you know a weird
amount about glitter, man.

08:34.165 --> 08:37.038
- So good detective work
is weird to you?

08:37.081 --> 08:38.779
Interesting squad
you have here, Raymond.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.476
- I didn't choose them.
They were here when I arrived.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.521
- Understood.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.957
The real question is
why Jeffords

08:43.000 --> 08:44.262
had glitter on him at all.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.786
Fortunately, I have the answer.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.831
I deduced that he has
three young daughters--

08:47.875 --> 08:49.180
twins and a toddler.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.052
- Big deal.
You saw the picture on his desk.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.097
- I did, and judging by

08:53.141 --> 08:55.186
the maple trees in
the background of that picture,

08:55.230 --> 08:57.624
it was taken last fall--
probably mid October.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.452
The twins are smiling,
each revealing a missing tooth.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.890
The twin on the right--
let's call her "Twin A."

09:02.933 --> 09:04.239
- That's Cagney.
- Is that relevant?

09:04.282 --> 09:05.545
- It's her name.
- So no.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
- Twin A is missing
an upper right incisor

09:07.634 --> 09:10.288
while Twin B is missing
a lower left incisor

09:10.332 --> 09:12.464
suggesting that they were seven
when the photo was taken,

09:12.508 --> 09:14.118
which would put them
in second grade.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.903
Spring semester
of second grade is when

09:15.946 --> 09:18.601
the Brooklyn schools
do their solar system unit,

09:18.645 --> 09:20.168
a highlight of which
is constructing

09:20.211 --> 09:21.561
a mobile of the planets.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.346
My hypothesis is that Twin A
and Twin B requested

09:24.389 --> 09:28.132
Daddy's help making Mars
sparkle, hence the red glitter.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.395
- Damn, yeah,
that's exactly right.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.571
- Just seems like
a very complicated way

09:31.614 --> 09:33.007
of saying Terry has kids.
- Thank you.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.225
- What?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.400
- The point is,
Jeffords is innocent,

09:35.444 --> 09:38.403
so I guess it's fair to say
case open.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.667
- My God, I have gooseflesh.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.625
- So now I'd like to move on
to a real suspect.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.280
I wanna see detective Diaz
in the box.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.064
- What--don't gasp for him.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.370
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.937
It just slipped out.
- Title of your sex tape.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.069
- Yeah, it's--obviously
it's the title of his sex tape.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.767
Everyone's taking my stuff.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
- Dillman never talks first
when he's in the box.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.561
- Well, Rosa never initiates
conversation of any kind.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.650
- Guys, I really
have to get out of here.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.870
Somebody please say something
to get it started.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.349
- No.
- And there it is.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.569
Now that I have the upper hand,
let's get started.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.571
- Stupid Terry
and his stupid kids.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.269
You were the only suspect
who did not go out for lunch,

10:18.313 --> 10:20.054
but if you were eating
at your desk,

10:20.097 --> 10:21.229
how did you not see
the perpetrator

10:21.272 --> 10:22.578
plant the glitter bomb?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.797
- I wasn't at my desk.
I was in the break room.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.233
- Oh, the break room.
That explains it.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.669
I guess we're done here.

10:26.713 --> 10:30.064
- Oh, here it comes--
the Dillman double back.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.500
- Just to double back--

10:31.543 --> 10:33.328
- Oh, my.
He actually said the words.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.590
What a treat.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.113
- If you were
in the break room,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.898
why was the IP address
of your laptop

10:37.941 --> 10:40.117
logged into the Wi-Fi
on the fifth floor?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.771
- Fine.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.904
There's an empty office there
where I go to be alone.

10:43.947 --> 10:48.212
- Seems innocent enough.
Why would you lie about that?

10:48.256 --> 10:50.824
Maybe because you were up there
assembling a glitter bomb.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.611
- I'm sorry, I didn't--
- I was watching a soap opera.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.482
It's called "Drake's Hollow."
I never miss an episode.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.615
It's my mother's favorite show,
and when things were bad

10:59.659 --> 11:01.095
between us,
it was the one thing

11:01.138 --> 11:02.966
that we could still talk about.
- Oh, that's sweet.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.402
- It is kind of sweet.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.317
- Sweet enough to fool
a lesser detective.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.493
- What--I wasn't fooled.
Take her away.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.452
- If you really watch
"Drake's Hollow" every day,

11:10.495 --> 11:12.019
you won't mind if I give you
a little quiz.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.064
You see, I've been known
to visit the Hollow myself

11:14.108 --> 11:16.980
from time to time not unlike
Nicholas Van Bronderberg.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.113
Who's the father
of Eliana's twins?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.288
- Christian is Jacob's father,

11:20.331 --> 11:21.898
but Joshua was stolen
from the hospital.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.421
His real father
remains unknown.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.596
- Who did Joshua
grow up to marry?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.076
First came Sandra,
then there was Brigitte,

11:26.120 --> 11:27.295
but she turned out
to be his sister.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.775
Katherine died
during childbirth,

11:28.818 --> 11:30.298
though it was later revealed
that she was murdered

11:30.341 --> 11:31.778
by Amanda,
Joshua's next wife.

11:31.821 --> 11:32.822
They divorced after Amanda

11:32.866 --> 11:33.997
was sentenced
to the electric chair.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.825
But Joshua rebounded quickly
with Jasmine.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.653
Jasmine was followed by Grace,
the love of his life,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.350
but she had a contract dispute
with the producers

11:39.394 --> 11:41.091
so she was killed
off camera by a snake.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.484
You messed up.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.529
You forgot Gwendolyn.
- No, I didn't.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.575
Joshua and Gwendolyn were
technically never married

11:46.618 --> 11:49.317
because that whole season took
place inside Kiki's mind...

11:49.360 --> 11:51.362
While she was in a coma.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.191
- Diaz is innocent.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.150
- So I guess he was wrong
about Rosa.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.978
- Don't worry about Dillman.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.023
He's the best detective
I've ever worked with.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.677
- Or you just
keep talking him up

12:01.721 --> 12:03.635
because you don't want us
to notice how weird it is

12:03.679 --> 12:05.072
that you brought in a friend
to work the case.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.290
- We're not friends.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.552
My only friends
are James and Julian.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.337
- Hurtful, but I still
think it's strange

12:09.380 --> 12:10.773
that you won't let me
run the investigation--

12:10.817 --> 12:12.296
unless, of course,
there's something

12:12.340 --> 12:13.733
you're scared I might find.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.864
- Excuse me?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.344
- Where were you between
12:20 and 12:55?

12:16.387 --> 12:17.867
- You aren't
seriously suggesting

12:17.911 --> 12:19.129
that I am the prank man.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.740
- It does seem
a little far-fetched, Jake.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.872
I mean, he did just use
the phrase, "prank man."

12:22.916 --> 12:24.221
- It's not far-fetched at all.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.528
Holt is not the joyless robot
that he once was.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.225
- Is this about the time
I ate a burrito?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.357
I was pressured into it.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.924
- Just tell us
where you were at lunch.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.447
- Well, if you must know,
I was having lunch with Boyle.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.535
No way.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.102
You two are
the second most unlikely

12:35.145 --> 12:36.407
Nine-Nine lunch combination.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.105
First is anyone
with Hitchcock and Scully.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.584
Second is Holt and Charles.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.021
- It is pretty strange.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.023
- I mean, obviously
it was uncomfortable,

12:43.066 --> 12:44.111
but it was a work lunch.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.329
- Look, it's not
a big deal, guys.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.591
We don't have to talk about it.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.463
- I was offering him
the task force position.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.639
Boyle is my choice.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.684
- Boyle?

12:52.728 --> 12:53.555
From work?

12:53.598 --> 12:56.036
Oh.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.865
How great for him...
And no one else.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.301
You know what, I just remembered
that I'm late to leave.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.432
Gotta go, bye.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.436
- Hey.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.786
- I don't understand, Charles.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.352
If Holt already assigned you
to the task force,

13:08.396 --> 13:09.701
why were you helping me
try and get it?

13:09.745 --> 13:11.834
- I was planning
on telling Holt no.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.357
- What?
That's insane.

13:13.401 --> 13:14.881
It's a huge opportunity.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.796
- I know, but I've been meaning
to cut back on hours.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.362
I'm working too much.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.842
It's affecting Nikolaj
at school.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
He's been making
so many new friends.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.193
- Wait,
isn't that a good thing?

13:23.237 --> 13:24.194
- No, he's trying
to get me jealous.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.717
I did the same thing to my dad.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.937
So, Jake, for real.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.112
I'm not gonna take
the assignment.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.984
Okay, I guess that makes sense.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.551
But just promise me you're not
turning it down because of me.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.379
- Jake, I promise.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.512
- Okay.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.427
Great, well,

13:39.470 --> 13:41.124
if you're turning it down,
that means there's still

13:41.168 --> 13:42.473
an opportunity for me
to solve the case

13:42.517 --> 13:44.127
and prove to Holt
I belong on the task force.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.086
- What task force?
both:

13:46.129 --> 13:48.001
- How long have you been here?
- Just a few seconds.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.263
But that was
more than enough time

13:49.306 --> 13:50.786
for me to ascertain
everything about you--

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
- As a person, yes, we know.
No one likes a know-it-all.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.703
- You're married to one.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.226
- You're married to one.
- Follow me.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.880
I have an important
announcement to make.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.535
both: Dillman.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.058
- May I have everyone's
attention please?

14:02.102 --> 14:04.495
I have solved the,
"who has done this."

14:04.539 --> 14:06.323
I know by whom it was done.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.934
It was Jake Peralta.
- What?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.153
That's crazy.
The box was on my desk.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.676
I'm the victim.
- Wrong.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.417
Scully's the victim.
- You know,

14:13.461 --> 14:15.028
you think glitter's gonna taste
like sprinkles, but it doesn't.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.420
It tastes like blood.
- That is blood.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.595
The glitter's
shredding your tongue.

14:17.639 --> 14:18.770
- Oh.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.728
- Why would I blow up
my own desk?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.251
- For the task force.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.862
I just heard you say
you wanted to prove to Holt

14:22.905 --> 14:24.037
that you're
a great detective.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.603
That's why you set
this whole thing up.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.996
It was a perfect plan,

14:27.040 --> 14:28.780
and you would've gotten away
with it if not for me.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.173
- Wow.
You're a lunatic.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.088
- Would a lunatic know
that your body temperature

14:32.132 --> 14:34.525
just rose 9/10 of a degree
indicating guilt?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.092
- Yes.
- Oh, look.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.616
What do we have here--

14:38.660 --> 14:40.227
a receipt from Party Zone

14:40.270 --> 14:41.924
for one air tank rental
paid in cash.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.057
- That's not mine.
I never keep my receipts.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.275
Amy, tell them.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.624
Tell them how much
our accountant hates me.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.061
- She hates him so much.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.279
- My bag was sitting
next to my desk.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.759
Anyone could have
put that in there.

14:50.802 --> 14:51.978
That kind of evidence
would never hold up at trial.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.283
You'd be laughed out of court.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.589
- I've only been laughed at
in court once,

14:54.632 --> 14:56.373
and that was because
I made a terrific joke.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.201
- I was there.
It was hilarious.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.376
- Come on.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.596
- I guess it's fair to say
case closed.

15:01.639 --> 15:02.945
- No.
He stole that from me.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.164
- Go home.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.427
You're suspended
until further notice.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.732
- This is nuts.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.082
I can't believe
Holt believes

15:09.125 --> 15:11.301
that ridiculous windbag
and his sack of lies.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.956
Oh, I know everything about
glitter and "Drake's Elbow."

15:14.000 --> 15:15.262
- "Hollow."
- Amy, please.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.481
I just need your support
right now, okay?

15:17.525 --> 15:18.961
- Wait a minute,
you believe me, right?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.832
- Of course I do.
I'm your wife.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.182
I'm on your side
no matter what.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.618
Thanks.

15:23.661 --> 15:24.967
Same, by the way.
- Thanks.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.534
I mean,
no one really suspects me.

15:26.577 --> 15:27.970
- Right.
- Look, go home.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.972
I'll check for prints
on the Party Zone receipt.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.409
Yours won't be there,
but maybe someone else's will.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.846
- Wait a minute.
Prints--that's it.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.761
I think I know who framed me.
- Who?

15:36.805 --> 15:37.893
- I can't say yet.
I wanna be sure.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.112
- You wanna do
a big, dramatic reveal

15:39.155 --> 15:40.374
in front of everyone,
don't you?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.505
- Yes, obviously.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.506
Look, I have to check
on one thing.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.073
Don't let anybody leave.
- Okay.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.728
Attention, everyone.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.425
Stop what you are doing.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.774
Eh, still a little Nazi.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.124
I'm gonna just drop the accent.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.256
- Peralta, you can't be here.
You're suspended.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.823
And you're lucky
it's not worse.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.172
The DA's office
wanted you fired.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.435
- I'm being framed,
and I know who did it.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.523
It was Dillman!

15:59.567 --> 16:02.352
I just met you today.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.919
Why would I do that?
- Good question.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.009
It's because you want Holt
to put you on that task force.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
- Dillman can't be
on a New York task force.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.752
The SFPD would never
approve it.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.015
- Correct, only he's not SFPD.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.321
When you first arrived,
you asked us to check

16:14.364 --> 16:16.410
the fingerprints
against the AFI system,

16:16.453 --> 16:19.021
but that system hasn't
been used in over five years

16:19.065 --> 16:20.370
by any police department.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.939
- Well, I used
the AFI system for 20 years.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.897
I guess I misspoke.
- Oh, misspoke.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.073
I see.
That explains everything.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.683
My apologies.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.815
I'm just gonna
head back on out to exile--

16:30.859 --> 16:32.078
just to double back.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.601
- My God.
He's double backing Dillman.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.994
- How could the best detective
that Holt's ever worked with

16:35.037 --> 16:36.212
make such a mistake?

16:36.256 --> 16:37.518
I wondered myself,
so I made a few phone calls.

16:37.561 --> 16:40.086
It turns out,
Dillman was fired by the SFPD.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.913
I guess he rubbed the brass
the wrong way.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.393
Not only that,
but he's currently working

16:43.437 --> 16:46.179
part time at Yarn Barn,
a hobby shop in Albany.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.572
I have his manager
on the phone right now.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.661
- Frank, what is going on?
You have a shift tonight.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.054
You know I have finals.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.534
I'm so sorry, Alyssa.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.711
I got hung up in the city.
I just lost track of time.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.234
- This explains everything.
He's not a great detective.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.236
He's a sad man
working part time

17:00.280 --> 17:02.021
selling crafting supplies.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.849
- Okay, fine, yes.
I was fired by the SFPD.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.242
And yes, I contacted Raymond

17:06.286 --> 17:07.722
in hopes of getting on
that task force.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.072
I thought it would be my way
back onto the NYPD.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.595
Oh, my God.
I hate the Yarn Barn.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.162
- Really disappointing
to hear, Frank,

17:13.206 --> 17:14.685
- Yeah, well you're
a bad manager, Alyssa, okay?

17:14.729 --> 17:17.210
You play favorites and it hurts
to be on the outside.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.385
- You don't even show up to--
- Okay.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.560
- I was gonna bring up
the task force

17:19.603 --> 17:21.083
when I had lunch
with Raymond tomorrow,

17:21.127 --> 17:22.693
but when he called
about this case,

17:22.737 --> 17:24.956
I thought solving it
would seal the deal--

17:25.000 --> 17:26.001
- Which would have been easy
since you set

17:26.045 --> 17:27.089
the whole thing up to frame me.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.438
- Ridiculous.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.223
Why would I have waited
so long to accuse you?

17:30.266 --> 17:31.224
- Because if you
solved it right away,

17:31.267 --> 17:32.355
it would've been too obvious.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.400
- He's deflecting
because he's guilty.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.792
- Dillman lied about
where he worked.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.011
We can't trust him.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.968
- The receipt was
in Peralta's bag.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.100
- You're the glitter expert.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.101
- Well, you're
the Prankmaster General.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
both: It was him.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.627
- It wasn't either of you,

17:43.671 --> 17:45.977
but I know who it was.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.327
- Son of a bitch
stole my bullhorn.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.419
- Okay, I'm not 100% sure
this is right,

17:52.462 --> 17:54.203
and maybe
I'm missing something--

17:54.247 --> 17:55.639
- Charles, as a veteran
of many big reveals,

17:55.683 --> 17:56.771
can I give you a tip?

17:56.814 --> 17:58.381
Not so much waffling.
- I agree.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.339
You're not commanding the room.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.297
- Let him finish--his way.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.298
But do pace it up a bit,
Charles.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.647
- Copy that.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.606
So from the beginning,
I was very skeptical

18:05.649 --> 18:07.825
that anyone in our squad
was behind the prank.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.392
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I did, and then you said,

18:09.436 --> 18:11.133
"That's exactly what
a guilty person would say."

18:11.177 --> 18:12.178
- Eh, I stand by it.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.267
- Okay, so who was
the prank man?

18:14.310 --> 18:15.311
- There was no prank.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.704
That was just a cover.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.272
You see, guys,
the point of the explosion

18:19.315 --> 18:22.449
was to contaminate the evidence
of the Dekalb Street murder.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.886
- But the suspect is in prison,
has no ties to organized crime,

18:24.929 --> 18:26.192
and no means
of bribing an officer.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.976
How could he have possibly
pulled that off?

18:28.019 --> 18:29.630
- Yeah, Jake, that stumped me
for a little bit too,

18:29.673 --> 18:31.936
but then something you said
gave me an idea.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.808
- I mean, that kind of evidence
would never hold up at trial.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.157
You'd be laughed out of court.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.550
Ah, yeah,
I remember when I said that.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.378
It was awesome.
Wait, but who did it?

18:38.421 --> 18:40.641
- The mastermind
was ADA Greene.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.425
He didn't have enough evidence
for the case.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.774
He was afraid
he was gonna lose

18:43.818 --> 18:45.298
and needed someone
to blame it on.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.647
- Whom did he work with--

18:46.690 --> 18:48.431
obviously someone who knew
about the pranks

18:48.475 --> 18:50.607
and that Amy called Jake
"babe."

18:50.651 --> 18:52.043
- Excellent question, Captain.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.132
It took a little digging
to find that out,

18:53.175 --> 18:54.742
but I pulled
some personnel files

18:54.785 --> 18:56.787
and combed through
some social media.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.659
Do you know what
Greene's wife's maiden name is?

18:58.702 --> 18:59.790
- Duchovny?
- No.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.878
- Zappa.
- No.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.489
- Fagerbakke.
- No, Booth.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.317
Howard Booth--

19:04.360 --> 19:05.492
as in, Officer Booth.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.624
- Oh, yes.
Officer Howard.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.060
- He's Greene's brother-in-law.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.106
He didn't just put the evidence
on Jake's desk.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.108
He put the glitter bomb there.
- Oh, my God.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.458
We have to find Booth.
- Already did it.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.807
And I booked him.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.680
- Oh, classic elevator reveal.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.508
This feels like it calls
for an audible gasp.

19:21.551 --> 19:22.944
- Not from you, Charles.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.206
From me.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.513
- Wait, did you just
gasp at my gasp?

19:26.556 --> 19:28.297
- Sorry.
Your gasp was so good.

19:28.341 --> 19:29.733
- Oh, thank you for gasping
at my gasp.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.300
- My pleasure.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.129
- Sorry you missed
your daughter's concert.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.391
- No, no, it's okay.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.219
Sharon totally understood--

19:37.263 --> 19:39.265
after I lied to her
and said we had to stay late

19:39.308 --> 19:40.440
because Rosa got shot.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.224
Next time you see her,
walk with a limp.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.183
- Copy that.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.272
- Hey, you know you don't
have to sweep up, right?

19:46.315 --> 19:47.577
- Well, someone's gotta.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.057
Plus it reminds me
of the three years I spent

19:49.100 --> 19:50.493
as a cleaning lady in college.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.887
- Huh, I guess there really
is no term for cleaning man.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.715
- Mm-mm.
- That's not great.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.238
So hey, listen.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.719
I wanted to say great job today
and also I'm sorry.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.024
- Sorry for what?

20:00.068 --> 20:01.330
- Well, when I heard
you got the task force,

20:01.374 --> 20:03.245
my first reaction was just
to feel sad for myself

20:03.289 --> 20:04.377
instead of happy for you.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.379
- Well, you sure hid it well.

20:06.422 --> 20:07.728
- I really didn't.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.556
I stormed into the other room
and moped by myself.

20:09.599 --> 20:10.557
- Eh, but you had style.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.907
- Charles, no.
Look.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.865
You have to take
the task force job.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.911
- Really?
What about Nikolaj?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.739
- He's gonna be so proud
of his dad.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.480
I bet he even ditches
those new friends.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.742
- Oh, man.
That's the dream.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.570
Thank you for saying that.

20:23.613 --> 20:26.094
Honestly, though, I still don't
get why Holt chose me over you.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.879
- Are you kidding?
I mean, just look at today.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.751
Instead of fighting
for attention,

20:30.794 --> 20:32.448
you did the work and
methodically built your case.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.189
You noticed things that
a room full of seasoned cops

20:34.233 --> 20:35.538
all missed.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.279
You're a great detective,
Charles.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.672
- Wow.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.805
Even in defeat,
you are a true prince of a man.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.590
The task force is yours.
- What? No.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.939
Boyle, just take the win!

20:44.982 --> 20:46.984
- Right.
- It was good to see you today.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.248
I'll keep my ears open for any
job opportunities that arise.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.598
- Appreciate it.
I could use it.

20:51.641 --> 20:55.036
Just got a text from Alyssa I've
been fired by the Yarn Barn.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.430
- Well, you still the best damn
detective I've ever worked with.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.127
- Thank you.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.607
Wait a minute.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.261
Your iris just contracted
by 1/10th of a millimeter.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.566
You're lying.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.351
- Yes, I've lost a lot
of respect for you today.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.483
- Understood.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.051
Goodbye, Raymond.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.009
- Well...

21:12.053 --> 21:14.751
Since Dillman is clearly
out of the top spot now,

21:14.795 --> 21:16.623
who's the best detective
you've ever worked with?

21:16.666 --> 21:19.190
- It's Sergeant
Leslie Hunt-Minkoff.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.411
- Who?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.326
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
