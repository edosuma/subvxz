ALEX: The more parents we lose,
the safer we get.

41:59.978 --> 42:01.772
One night.
MOLLY: Wait.

42:02.981 --> 42:06.860
I was pissed at Chase too
for betraying us and being a coward‐‐

42:06.860 --> 42:08.278
CHASE:
Still right here, guys.

42:09.488 --> 42:12.282
‐ But this is our moment of victory.

42:13.575 --> 42:15.953
And we're all here together.

42:17.538 --> 42:20.123
I've basically lost two sets of parents,

42:20.123 --> 42:22.417
and I'll be damned if I lose
any more family members.

42:23.752 --> 42:26.547
Yeah. Chase is family.

42:27.589 --> 42:30.676
Even if he's a cowardly betrayer.
‐ Which he definitely is.

42:30.676 --> 42:31.885
MOLLY:
All I'm saying is...

42:33.720 --> 42:34.888
I think he should stay.

42:36.723 --> 42:39.268
And you all can just get over it.

42:39.852 --> 42:41.353
Because we're a family.

42:42.563 --> 42:46.233
So, say your "sorrys" to each other,
and let's celebrate!

42:47.609 --> 42:49.194
‐ Yeah, um...
‐ One night.

42:50.779 --> 42:52.281
‐ I'm pretty beat.

42:55.117 --> 42:56.118
‐ I tried.

42:57.077 --> 42:58.537
‐ I appreciate it.

42:58.537 --> 42:59.872
XAVIN:
Wait.

42:59.872 --> 43:01.957
What about the fourth member
of the Gibb family?

43:02.749 --> 43:06.295
We're not safe
until he's discovered and destroyed.

43:06.295 --> 43:09.173
‐ Well... We'll, uh‐‐
we'll be on high alert tonight.

43:09.173 --> 43:11.717
In the morning, we can try and figure out
a way to draw him out.

43:11.717 --> 43:14.636
XAVIN:
No. You don't understand.

43:15.888 --> 43:18.056
Karolina cannot be alone with Nico.

43:18.849 --> 43:19.933
She's not safe.

43:20.684 --> 43:22.769
‐ Wait, are you saying
that Nico is the alien?

43:22.769 --> 43:25.647
‐ No. Honestly, that's probably
just your jealousy talking, Xavin.

43:26.231 --> 43:27.566
‐ That's kinda not cool, X.

43:27.566 --> 43:30.319
‐ I know that it's hard for you to see
Nico and I together,

43:30.319 --> 43:33.322
especially because you believe
in your prophesy,

43:33.322 --> 43:35.574
but now that we're both back‐‐
‐ No.

43:36.575 --> 43:37.910
No, I‐‐

43:40.037 --> 43:41.705
I think she's right.

43:42.998 --> 43:44.208
I, uh...

43:46.084 --> 43:48.545
I've been having these waking dreams.

43:49.379 --> 43:50.923
Hallucinations.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.011
I think that thing is inside of me.

43:58.472 --> 44:01.892
And if it is,
then none of you are safe.
