All right! Snow day!

Are sunlit ice crystals

00:11.083 --> 00:14.458
cause for celebration?

They are when they mean

00:14.500 --> 00:16.917
school's canceled.

This is the perfect opportunity

00:16.959 --> 00:20.125
to catch up on your homework!

00:20.166 --> 00:23.333
A snow day's more like

00:20.166 --> 00:23.333
a surprise vacation, Boulder.

Everyone just stays home

00:23.375 --> 00:25.750

00:36.166 --> 00:38.458
"not really safe to travel"?

00:38.500 --> 00:41.875
Or am I just

I'm losing feeling

Relax, Blades. I'm keeping

01:04.834 --> 01:08.083
close watch on your instruments.

01:08.125 --> 01:10.625
My instruments

01:10.667 --> 01:12.333
I have a visual

on the skier, Dad.

SKIER: Aah!

01:13.834 --> 01:15.625
( gasps )

01:15.667 --> 01:17.625
Oh, looks like the skier's

01:15.667 --> 01:17.625
unconscious, Dad.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.333
We'll need help

01:20.250 --> 01:22.333

so afraid of? Snow?

09:21.208 --> 09:23.291
KADE:

09:21.208 --> 09:23.291
Lightning too?

09:23.333 --> 09:25.417
I can't remember a storm

09:23.333 --> 09:25.417
this bad.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.375
Thundersnow.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.250
The Bots should see this.

09:31.417 --> 09:33.208
Cody, are you still

09:31.417 --> 09:33.208
in the bunker?

09:33.250 --> 09:35.041
Uh, he's with Blades, Dad.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.417
They're playing some game

09:35.083 --> 09:37.417
at the Hall of Inspiration.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.917
( electricity crackling )

09:43.959 --> 09:45.375
Cody!

09:48.208 --> 09:51.625
Error. Error. Error.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.041

09:57.875 --> 10:00.250
Aah! Cody!

10:00.291 --> 10:02.875
Is it just me,

10:00.291 --> 10:02.875
or was that fire kind of hot?

10:04.458 --> 10:08.333
Not just game hot...

10:04.458 --> 10:08.333
actually, really hot!

10:10.000 --> 10:13.917
And that truly,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.917
really, really hurts!

10:18.709 --> 10:20.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:21.000 --> 10:22.250
( Cody screams )

10:24.500 --> 10:25.792
I thought you said

10:25.834 --> 10:27.500
nothing in this game

10:25.834 --> 10:27.500
could actually hurt us!

10:27.542 --> 10:29.041
It's not supposed to.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.166
Something must be wrong

10:29.083 --> 10:31.166
with the program.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.291
( both scream )

10:33.333 --> 10:35.875
(  dramatic electronic theme

10:33.333 --> 10:35.875

10:36.959 --> 10:39.375
We quit! Game over!

10:40.625 --> 10:41.875
End VR!

10:44.250 --> 10:45.458
I'm sorry, Cody.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.208
I'm afraid

10:45.500 --> 10:47.208
I can't do that.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.959
But we don't want

10:47.250 --> 10:48.959
to play anymore!

10:49.000 --> 10:51.709
Override failure 0357.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.500
Reality mode locked.

10:53.542 --> 10:54.834
Goodbye.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.667
The VR tech's

10:54.875 --> 10:56.667
malfunctioning.

10:56.709 --> 10:59.500
This isn't virtual anymore.

10:56.709 --> 10:59.500
It's real!

10:59.542 --> 11:04.667
You mean we're stuck in here?

10:59.542 --> 11:04.667
Forever? With that?

11:04.709 --> 11:06.667
The only way out for sure

11:04.709 --> 11:06.667
is to finish the game.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.959
We have to win!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.667
( both scream )

11:14.083 --> 11:16.125
( both gasp )

11:16.166 --> 11:20.166
BLADES:

11:16.166 --> 11:20.166
Dragons seem a lot friendlier

11:16.166 --> 11:20.166
on public television!

11:21.875 --> 11:23.959
( both grunting )

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
(  upbeat theme playing  )

11:30.959 --> 11:32.417
Come on, Blades.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.875
To get to the flag,

11:32.458 --> 11:33.875
we'll have to jump!

11:33.917 --> 11:36.208
And get barbecued?

11:33.917 --> 11:36.208
Uh-uh.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.917
There is no way

11:36.250 --> 11:39.917
I'm moving off this-- Hey!

11:39.959 --> 11:42.917
Hurry! If we don't jump now,

11:39.959 --> 11:42.917
we'll fall off!

11:42.959 --> 11:44.959
( Cody grunts )

11:47.250 --> 11:48.875
( whining moan )

11:48.917 --> 11:51.750
( screams then grunts )

11:51.792 --> 11:54.291
I did it!

11:51.792 --> 11:54.291
Yes! Ha-ha!

11:54.333 --> 11:57.542
Take that, virtual reality!

11:57.583 --> 12:00.417
CODY:

11:57.583 --> 12:00.417
Uh, Blades?

11:57.583 --> 12:00.417
We have to keep going.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.709
( Blades sighs )

12:03.709 --> 12:05.709
( grunts )

12:05.750 --> 12:07.500
Cody? Blades?

12:07.542 --> 12:10.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:10.500 --> 12:13.625
Looks like the lightning

12:10.500 --> 12:13.625
shorted out some of this tech.

12:18.333 --> 12:21.333
Chief, I have found evidence

12:18.333 --> 12:21.333
that Cody and Blades were here.

12:21.375 --> 12:25.667
They probably still are,

12:21.375 --> 12:25.667
inside Doc's new VR game.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.333
Come on out, Son.

12:27.375 --> 12:31.667
I want you two home before

12:27.375 --> 12:31.667
this storm gets any worse.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.542
I guess they can't hear us.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.208
There's gotta be some way

12:33.583 --> 12:35.208
to open these...

12:35.250 --> 12:37.917
Sir, if I may?

12:37.959 --> 12:39.834
( grunts )

12:39.875 --> 12:41.250
Chase!

12:41.291 --> 12:46.083
Ugh. Apparently, I may not.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.625
Maybe Doc can help us.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.583
Oh, there's no reception

12:49.709 --> 12:51.583
in this storm.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.000
Team, we need backup.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.667
What do you know

12:53.041 --> 12:55.667
about video games?

12:55.709 --> 12:58.166
(  upbeat theme playing  )

12:58.208 --> 13:00.291
CODY: Awesome!

12:58.208 --> 13:00.291
BLADES: We made it!

13:02.917 --> 13:05.542
Now what?

13:02.917 --> 13:05.542
I'm not sure.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.125
The game doesn't just tell you

13:05.583 --> 13:08.125
what you need to win.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.083
Figuring it out

13:08.166 --> 13:10.083
is the fun part.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.709
I was wondering

13:10.125 --> 13:13.709
when the "fun" would start.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.125
Aah! Aah!

13:16.166 --> 13:18.208
( grunts )

13:18.250 --> 13:19.834
Let me go, Blades.

13:19.875 --> 13:23.625
No! If you fall, I fall!

13:23.667 --> 13:26.542
It's okay. Look.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.542
Invincibility!

13:28.166 --> 13:29.375
Please don't miss!

Fire level complete.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.500
( both sigh )

13:48.041 --> 13:49.667
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.750
Looks like these VR chambers

13:49.709 --> 13:51.750
can't be opened manually

13:51.792 --> 13:53.250
while the game is in play.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.083
So we turn it off.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.208
No!

13:55.125 --> 13:58.208
That's neural-net technology!

13:58.250 --> 14:00.959
Sorry, left my geek

13:58.250 --> 14:00.959
dictionary at home.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.542
BOULDER:

14:01.000 --> 14:02.542
The rooms' circuitry is linked

14:02.583 --> 14:04.709
directly into

14:02.583 --> 14:04.709
Cody and Blades' minds.

14:04.750 --> 14:08.375
If we shut off the VR tech,

14:04.750 --> 14:08.375
we might shut off their brains!

14:08.417 --> 14:12.083
You mean Cody and Blades could

14:08.417 --> 14:12.083
be trapped in the game forever?

14:12.125 --> 14:14.000
Is there nothing

14:12.125 --> 14:14.000
you can do, Graham?

14:14.041 --> 14:15.875
( sighs ):

14:14.041 --> 14:15.875
No.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.583
The only way

14:15.917 --> 14:17.583
for the rooms to open

14:17.625 --> 14:19.834
and for Cody and Blades

14:17.625 --> 14:19.834
to return safely

14:19.875 --> 14:23.083
is for the game

14:19.875 --> 14:23.083
to terminate by itself.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.000
They have to beat it.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.667
Cody knows how to play

14:25.041 --> 14:26.667
these things.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.417
But Blades is probably

14:26.709 --> 14:29.417
too scared to move!

14:29.458 --> 14:32.041
If only we could offer

14:29.458 --> 14:32.041
assistance.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.542
Maybe you can.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.583
I might be able to patch

14:33.583 --> 14:35.583
someone into the system.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.375
I'll go.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.375
Blades is my responsibility.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.083
They both are.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.625
I'll need a little time

14:41.125 --> 14:43.625
to put together a controller.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.792
( grunts )

14:45.834 --> 14:50.333

GRAHAM:

14:52.750 --> 14:54.583
If those lines snap...

14:54.625 --> 14:56.333
The Hall loses all power.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.375
What would that do

14:56.375 --> 14:58.375
to the game?

14:58.417 --> 15:00.000
It's the same as turning it off.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.500
Then we make sure

15:00.041 --> 15:02.500
the power stays on.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.625
Graham, let me know

15:02.542 --> 15:04.625
as soon as you're ready for me.

Come on, Blades.

Finally, a little peace.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.709
I used to like video games,

15:36.750 --> 15:38.875
then I took an arrow

15:36.750 --> 15:38.875
to the knee...

15:38.917 --> 15:40.208
Got it.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.417
The trees

15:40.250 --> 15:42.417
are all booby-trapped.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.333
We need something

15:42.458 --> 15:44.333
to protect ourselves.

15:44.375 --> 15:48.250
Would a giant plate help?

15:48.291 --> 15:50.625
That's not a plate,

15:48.291 --> 15:50.625
it's a shield!

playing  )

18:20.917 --> 18:23.166
( Blades and Cody grunting )

18:23.208 --> 18:25.125
I'm coming!

18:25.166 --> 18:26.417
( grunts )

18:28.166 --> 18:30.041
( grunts )

18:30.083 --> 18:32.667
Heatwave!

18:30.083 --> 18:32.667
What are you doing here?

18:32.709 --> 18:35.417
I-I thought you needed help.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.917
Nope. Blades has been amazing!

18:37.959 --> 18:39.792
Good to see you, Heatwave,

18:39.834 --> 18:42.625
but aren't you afraid you'll be

18:39.834 --> 18:42.625
stuck in this game with us?

18:42.667 --> 18:44.542
A-Afraid?

18:44.583 --> 18:47.125
I'm here to win this thing

18:44.583 --> 18:47.125
and get us all out.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.625
( grunts )

18:48.667 --> 18:51.750
This program

18:48.667 --> 18:51.750
simulates pain too?

18:51.792 --> 18:54.041
Good times.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.250
(  upbeat theme playing  )

18:58.041 --> 18:59.291
( grunting )

19:01.542 --> 19:03.375
Hee-haw!

19:06.250 --> 19:08.250
( Cody grunting )

19:18.834 --> 19:21.208
( screeching roar )

19:21.250 --> 19:23.000

19:29.583 --> 19:32.041
Cody! Unh!

19:32.083 --> 19:33.792
( screeching roar )

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
Blades! The flag!

19:38.542 --> 19:40.917
( Heatwave grunting )

19:40.959 --> 19:43.250
Game on.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.375
Congratulations,

20:15.458 --> 20:17.375
players.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.834
The Elemental Quest

20:17.417 --> 20:19.834
is complete.

20:19.875 --> 20:23.375
The winner is you!

20:19.875 --> 20:23.375
Game over.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.041
Cody! Are you okay?

20:35.083 --> 20:37.709
Ohh. I am now.

20:41.458 --> 20:46.667
Virtual reality is even more

20:41.458 --> 20:46.667
dangerous than real reality.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.583
So then the monster attacks.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.333
Claws as big as your head!

20:52.375 --> 20:54.500
But Blades here

20:52.375 --> 20:54.500
charges right at it!

20:54.542 --> 20:56.625
Doesn't even bat an optic!

20:57.834 --> 20:59.667
Weren't you afraid?

20:59.709 --> 21:01.959
Afraid? No.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.166
I was terrified!

21:04.208 --> 21:06.667
But Cody needed me.

21:06.709 --> 21:09.125
Is that not the definition

21:06.709 --> 21:09.125
of courage?

21:09.166 --> 21:11.959
If Blades is scared

21:09.166 --> 21:11.959
half as often as he says he is,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.125
he might well be

21:12.000 --> 21:15.125
the bravest of us all.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.041
There is still one thing

21:15.166 --> 21:18.041
I fail to comprehend.

21:18.083 --> 21:21.875
How is it that humans

21:18.083 --> 21:21.875
find a snow day enjoyable?

21:21.917 --> 21:23.333
You'll understand

21:23.375 --> 21:25.583
once we go sledding

21:23.375 --> 21:25.583
down Breakneck Slope.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.208
I'd rather fight another tree.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.208
Does that require a permit?

21:28.250 --> 21:29.458
I am not

21:28.250 --> 21:29.458
going out there again.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.750
Snow, thank you.
