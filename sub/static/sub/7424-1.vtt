11:07.732 --> 11:10.199
are doing at
a crime scene.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.467
Look, a woman was in trouble.

11:11.469 --> 11:12.635
Trouble? Trouble,
trouble how?

11:12.637 --> 11:14.803
I mean, did you...?

11:14.805 --> 11:16.471
No, JT, I didn't hurt her.

11:16.473 --> 11:18.907
Well, congratulations
'cause now we've got

11:18.909 --> 11:20.042
<i>her</i> at our door.

11:20.044 --> 11:21.443
Yeah, well, I didn't know

11:21.445 --> 11:23.679
it was going to be
her case, did I?

11:23.681 --> 11:25.614
Her case. Wh-What...

11:25.616 --> 11:27.683
Have you been
keeping tabs on her?

11:30.386 --> 11:34.156
Vincent, you
broke every rule:

11:34.158 --> 11:35.591
no interacting with anyone,
no entering a building...

11:35.593 --> 11:39.027
Yeah, I know what the rules are,
okay, I made them.

11:39.029 --> 11:41.564
It's been years,
all right?

11:41.566 --> 11:43.966
It starts to feel
like a prison in here.

11:43.968 --> 11:45.968
What prison has a flat screen
and an Xbox?

11:45.970 --> 11:47.503
And if it's so hard

11:47.505 --> 11:50.005
for you, why'd you stop
helping with the antidote?

11:50.007 --> 11:51.540
Yeah, because you know
what the definition

11:51.542 --> 11:53.509
of insanity is, JT?

11:53.511 --> 11:56.011
Doing the same thing
over and over again

11:56.013 --> 11:57.746
and expecting
a different result, okay?

11:57.748 --> 11:59.848
That's why.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.049
All right,
this is it, JT,

12:01.051 --> 12:03.452
this is my life.

12:03.454 --> 12:05.755
Okay.

12:05.757 --> 12:09.892
All I'm saying is,
if Catherine Chandler

12:09.894 --> 12:12.694
starts asking
questions,

12:12.696 --> 12:14.530
alerting Muirfield
that you're alive...

12:14.532 --> 12:17.433
we're both
dead men,

12:17.435 --> 12:18.901
and I don't mean "on a
piece of paper" dead.

12:18.903 --> 12:23.840
I mean dead
like <i>dead</i> dead.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.980
(siren chirps)

12:30.982 --> 12:33.283
Evan, please tell me
that you have something.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.785
I've got a pair of Louboutins
in an evidence bag.

12:35.787 --> 12:36.819
What size are you?

12:36.821 --> 12:37.920
You are so callous.

12:37.922 --> 12:39.955
Okay, so the head wounds
are too superficial

12:39.957 --> 12:41.256
to have killed her,

12:41.258 --> 12:43.058
but she does have signs
of low oxygenation.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.327
Suffocation,
strangulation?

12:45.329 --> 12:47.295
No ligature marks, but
she does have some rash.

12:47.297 --> 12:49.364
Possibly poisoning?

12:49.366 --> 12:50.632
But here's the weird part.
I can't take

12:50.634 --> 12:52.333
much more weird.
Bruised sternum,

12:52.335 --> 12:53.268
cracked ribs.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.669
You see that from
CPR sometimes.

12:54.671 --> 12:58.673
So, after the killer left,
someone tried to save her?

12:58.675 --> 13:00.008
Why wouldn't they
have stuck around?

13:00.010 --> 13:00.842
That's your job.

13:00.844 --> 13:02.578
Oh, I did find a hair.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.578
DNA?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.613
Way to bury the lead.

13:05.615 --> 13:08.082
Um, keep me posted.

13:08.084 --> 13:10.118
Hey, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.686
I've got premiere tickets.

13:11.688 --> 13:13.455
Free movie, open bar.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.090
What, that flight
attendant on layover?

13:15.092 --> 13:16.925
Permanently transferred
to Dallas.

13:16.927 --> 13:18.559
By you or by the airline?

13:18.561 --> 13:19.727
Well, it was coming up
to three months.

13:19.729 --> 13:21.596
I may have pulled
some strings.

13:21.598 --> 13:24.698
(phone beeping)
Oh.

13:24.700 --> 13:25.833
Our vic's husband surfaced.

13:25.835 --> 13:27.034
Always the husband.

13:27.036 --> 13:29.036
See, this is why I
stick to three months.

13:29.038 --> 13:32.106
Yeah, well, in this case, our
prime suspect is a dead guy.

13:32.108 --> 13:34.375
I've never seen him before.

13:34.377 --> 13:36.811
And you were
at your studio all night?

13:36.813 --> 13:37.912
Yes.

13:37.914 --> 13:39.447
I'm sorry to have to
ask this, Mr. Webster,

13:39.449 --> 13:42.148
but anyone who
can confirm that?

13:42.150 --> 13:44.883
The security guard.

13:44.885 --> 13:50.020
Oh, and, uh, I have the proofs
that I was developing.

13:52.923 --> 13:54.123
Were you at a club as well?

13:54.125 --> 13:56.692
No.

13:56.694 --> 13:57.860
No, I was
at a fund-raiser.

13:57.862 --> 13:58.860
I dropped in there

13:58.862 --> 14:00.528
on my way to the office.

14:00.530 --> 14:01.930
Did she go with you?

14:01.932 --> 14:03.998
No, no, she had to work.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.766
She just landed
a big promotion.

14:05.768 --> 14:07.634
She started out
as an intern there.

14:08.970 --> 14:11.371
Time-stamped from last night.

14:11.373 --> 14:13.106
Mr. Webster,
that promotion--

14:13.108 --> 14:15.375
you think it would have
earned her any enemies?

14:15.377 --> 14:19.244
You'd have to ask
her assistant Emily.

14:24.817 --> 14:26.818
You have a sleeping bag in there?
I probably should.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.886
It's a 24-7 gig.

14:30.922 --> 14:32.889
I mean, it was.

14:32.891 --> 14:35.625
But, Emily, was anyone jealous
of Ashley's promotion

14:35.627 --> 14:37.593
or up for that job, too?

14:38.561 --> 14:40.528
Maybe the beauty editor, but...

14:40.530 --> 14:42.096
The beauty editor?

14:42.098 --> 14:43.664
Chloe London.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.832
She thought that she
deserved the job,

14:45.834 --> 14:49.069
but, I'm sorry,
Ashley was the fashion editor.

14:49.071 --> 14:50.437
EVAN:
Cat.

14:50.439 --> 14:52.972
DNA just came in.

14:52.974 --> 14:55.408
Can I talk to
you for a sec?

14:55.410 --> 14:57.943
So who is it--
Vincent Keller?

14:57.945 --> 14:58.910
It's corrupted.

14:58.912 --> 14:59.844
Oh, you're kidding.

14:59.846 --> 15:01.245
Thing is,

15:01.247 --> 15:03.013
you know how you're always
talking about your mum's case?

15:03.015 --> 15:04.081
Not always, but...

15:04.083 --> 15:05.815
Evan, you're making me nervous.
No, no.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.717
I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

15:07.719 --> 15:10.720
The mass spectrometer's
probably just dirty.

15:12.155 --> 15:15.391

Hey, nice catch with JT's car,

15:59.566 --> 16:00.998
except I just woke up
three of his students.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.766
All confirm he was teaching

16:02.768 --> 16:05.735
Molecular Cellular Methods 2
that night.

16:05.737 --> 16:07.370
Yeah, I'm here.

16:08.539 --> 16:10.039
I don't see you.

early, thought I'd check it out.

16:12.610 --> 16:13.776
No, that's what
I'm telling you--

16:13.778 --> 16:15.077
there's nothing to check out.

16:15.079 --> 16:18.013
I'll call you later.

16:18.015 --> 16:19.647
Hello?

16:19.649 --> 16:21.983
CATHERINE:
<i>NYPD.</i>

16:21.985 --> 16:24.152
I've got a warrant.

Mr. Forbes.

16:26.889 --> 16:29.356

16:31.993 --> 16:34.161
Mr. Forbes.

16:46.675 --> 16:48.876
Mr. Forbes?

16:52.980 --> 16:56.015
Mr. Forbes.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.217
I know you're up here,
I can hear you.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.986
(rustling)

17:00.988 --> 17:03.188
VINCENT:
He's teaching class.

17:06.223 --> 17:08.659
I need you
to step out

17:08.661 --> 17:09.859
where I can see you.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.961
Sir,

17:11.963 --> 17:14.396
I'm not going to ask you again.

17:15.499 --> 17:17.300
(quietly):
Okay.

17:29.811 --> 17:32.012
You're Vincent Keller.

17:33.647 --> 17:35.648
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.282
I did not kill that woman.
And I didn't mention

17:37.284 --> 17:38.550
a murder,

17:38.552 --> 17:40.520
but since you
brought it up...

17:41.889 --> 17:44.223
...why were your prints
at the Webster crime scene?

17:44.225 --> 17:47.193
Look, I was out driving.

17:47.195 --> 17:49.128
I saw her collapse.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.496
She hit her head,
she needed help.

17:50.498 --> 17:52.732
So you followed her
into the hotel?

17:52.734 --> 17:55.167
I tried
to resuscitate her.

17:55.169 --> 17:57.269
You gave her CPR.

17:57.271 --> 17:58.637
You're a doctor.

17:58.639 --> 18:00.305
She had been poisoned.

18:00.307 --> 18:01.673
How would you know that?

18:01.675 --> 18:03.242
(phone buzzing)

18:03.244 --> 18:04.977
Your phone.

18:12.784 --> 18:13.884
Hey,

18:13.886 --> 18:16.220
has tox come back
on the Webster case yet?

18:16.222 --> 18:17.688
Our telepathy is working.

18:17.690 --> 18:20.123
Positive for lethal doses
of nicotine.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.191
Cat,

18:22.193 --> 18:23.359
I just gave you cause of death.

18:23.361 --> 18:24.394
Yeah,

18:24.396 --> 18:26.029
that's great.

18:26.031 --> 18:27.564
Okay.
I got to go.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.165
I'll see you at the cinema
at 9:00, yeah?

18:29.167 --> 18:30.166
Yeah, sounds good.

18:30.168 --> 18:31.768
(phone beeps off)

18:31.770 --> 18:32.836
How'd you know

18:32.838 --> 18:35.172
she was poisoned
if you didn't kill her?

18:35.974 --> 18:38.209
I have a good
sense of smell.

18:38.211 --> 18:40.044
You can smell poison?

18:40.046 --> 18:41.979
Look, I did not
hurt her, okay?

18:41.981 --> 18:43.414
But you were a witness.

18:44.349 --> 18:46.718
Look, I need your help.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.287
There was hair found
on the body, matches DNA

18:49.289 --> 18:50.922
from an old murder case.

18:50.924 --> 18:52.390
That night
did you see anything?

18:57.330 --> 18:59.398
Why do you have that?

19:00.433 --> 19:01.800
I need to know

19:01.802 --> 19:02.935
why you have that.

19:02.937 --> 19:04.737
I...
TESS: Catherine.

19:04.739 --> 19:05.972
No one can know
I'm here.

19:05.974 --> 19:07.140
Why?

19:07.142 --> 19:08.908
Why does everybody need
to think you're dead?

19:08.910 --> 19:10.009
Please,

19:10.011 --> 19:12.011
you know I did not
hurt that woman.

TESS:
NYPD.

19:14.916 --> 19:16.783
Please.

19:16.785 --> 19:18.317
We're not done here.

19:19.453 --> 19:21.254
NYPD.

19:21.256 --> 19:22.955
Hey.

19:22.957 --> 19:24.156
It's all clear.
What the hell are you doing?

19:24.158 --> 19:25.457
You were right,
there's nothing here.

19:25.459 --> 19:26.625
Come on, let's go.

19:27.894 --> 19:30.028
Come on.

19:39.231 --> 19:41.964
Hi, this is Detective
Catherine Chandler, NYPD.

19:42.702 --> 19:46.137
I need to speak
to Special Agent Hernandez.

19:46.139 --> 19:48.672
Transferred when?

19:48.674 --> 19:50.641
Joe's waiting for an update.

19:50.643 --> 19:52.809
Two minutes.

19:55.445 --> 19:56.946
Okay, then who can I speak to

19:56.948 --> 20:00.482
about a case he covered
nine years ago?

20:00.484 --> 20:03.252
All right, nicotine, when
ingested, kills in seconds.

20:03.254 --> 20:04.753
Security footage
is longer than that,

20:04.755 --> 20:06.655
so it must have been absorbed
through her skin,

20:06.657 --> 20:09.691
in which case it can take
two to four hours to work.

20:09.693 --> 20:11.052
So where was she during
that period of time?

20:11.053 --> 20:11.724
We checked her date book,

20:11.729 --> 20:14.229
hard drive-- no appointments,
she wasn't at work.

20:14.231 --> 20:16.565
Great, great, great,
so we are nowhere.

20:16.567 --> 20:18.534
I can't wait to
tell the DA.

20:18.536 --> 20:20.570
(distantly):
How's our dead vet fit in?

20:20.572 --> 20:22.806
♪ ♪

20:22.808 --> 20:24.708
(distantly):
Hello.

20:24.710 --> 20:26.509
Cat.

20:26.511 --> 20:27.777

Dead vet--

20:27.779 --> 20:28.812
how's he fit in?

20:28.814 --> 20:30.313

Well, you were

20:30.315 --> 20:31.981

to execute a search.

20:31.983 --> 20:33.016
Dead, not dead--

20:33.018 --> 20:34.517
this isn't an identity case.

20:34.519 --> 20:37.454
We need to focus on finding
the source of the poison.

20:37.456 --> 20:38.822
Ashley was
a fashion editor.

20:38.824 --> 20:40.657
You want to
kill her,

20:40.659 --> 20:43.494
you probably don't do it
with window cleaner.

20:43.496 --> 20:45.329
Then, what do you do it with?

20:45.331 --> 20:46.697
WOMAN:
<i>Do you really think Ashley</i>

20:46.699 --> 20:49.199
was poisoned by something that
came from the beauty closet?

20:49.201 --> 20:51.368
Ms. London, we're trying to
figure out what happened,

20:51.370 --> 20:52.403
and since you're
the beauty editor...

20:52.405 --> 20:54.605
That is a hair product,

20:54.607 --> 20:56.473
not a body lotion.

20:56.475 --> 20:58.242
Does everyone
get their samples

20:58.244 --> 20:59.410
from the beauty closet?

20:59.412 --> 21:00.444
If they're nice to me.

21:00.446 --> 21:01.511
They sign them out?

21:01.513 --> 21:02.612
And log it.

21:02.614 --> 21:04.514
Do you have any idea
how much these stuff costs?

21:04.516 --> 21:06.783
So Ashley Webster being
promoted over you,

21:06.785 --> 21:08.084
doesn't sound too nice.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.887
Okay, we're done here.

21:10.889 --> 21:13.189
Ms. London...

21:16.327 --> 21:17.627
CHLOE:
I don't mean to be rude,

21:17.629 --> 21:20.529
I have an editorial meeting
that started five minutes ago.

21:20.531 --> 21:22.398
This is Ashley's office.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.467
It's the executive
editor's office.

21:24.469 --> 21:26.402
Oh, so you got that promotion
after all.

21:26.404 --> 21:27.503
Not the way I wanted it.

21:27.505 --> 21:29.571
Look, I may not
have loved Ashley,

21:29.573 --> 21:31.673
but I didn't kill her.

21:31.675 --> 21:33.575
(knocking on glass)

21:33.577 --> 21:35.978
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have an issue to get out.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.914
I trust the two of you
can find your own way out?

21:39.582 --> 21:41.216
Yeah, we sure can.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.621
It's Ashley's stuff.

21:53.029 --> 21:55.530
Pregnancy test.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.100
There's two missing.

21:58.102 --> 21:59.468
So Ashley was pregnant?

21:59.470 --> 22:01.470
Autopsy wouldn't have caught
it if it was early enough.

22:01.472 --> 22:02.905
Husband didn't seem
like he knew.

22:02.907 --> 22:04.373
Maybe it wasn't his.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.375
So maybe she was cheating,

22:06.377 --> 22:07.643
husband found out?

22:07.645 --> 22:09.144
(phone ringing)

22:11.948 --> 22:12.948
Chandler.

22:12.950 --> 22:14.717
This is Special Agent
McCleary, FBI.

22:14.719 --> 22:16.018
You called about
a contaminated DNA sample

22:16.020 --> 22:18.487
linked to the murder case
of Vanessa Chandler?

22:18.489 --> 22:20.856
Yeah, I was hoping
we could meet up?

22:26.730 --> 22:28.864
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

22:31.668 --> 22:33.469
Detective Chandler.

22:33.471 --> 22:34.937
Agent McCleary.

22:34.939 --> 22:36.839
I appreciate you doing this.

22:36.841 --> 22:39.108
Hope it wasn't
too out of your way.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.510
Well, I wouldn't want
to be the reason

22:40.512 --> 22:41.711
you were late for
your son's birthday.

22:41.713 --> 22:42.646
(chuckling)

22:42.648 --> 22:44.080
Did you bring it with you?
I did.

22:44.082 --> 22:45.749
The analysis
looks corrupted,

22:45.751 --> 22:47.484
but the numbers
are identical.

22:47.486 --> 22:49.186
Well, we'll take a look.

23:00.365 --> 23:01.598
(blade snicks)

23:05.470 --> 23:07.204
(grunting)

23:08.406 --> 23:10.007
(Catherine cries out)

23:12.911 --> 23:14.311
(yelling)

23:17.949 --> 23:19.717
(man cries out)

23:34.732 --> 23:37.066
(music playing through earbuds):
♪ Just call me angel ♪

23:37.068 --> 23:39.669
♪ Ah, ah ♪

23:40.938 --> 23:44.841
♪ Just touch my cheek
before you leave me... ♪

23:48.212 --> 23:50.080
(both groaning)

23:53.418 --> 23:55.252
(grunting)

24:10.736 --> 24:12.103
(yelling)

24:15.641 --> 24:17.909
(pained grunt)

24:24.517 --> 24:26.151
(growling, Catherine gasps)

24:26.153 --> 24:27.619
(blows landing, grunting)

24:27.621 --> 24:29.855
(grunting)

24:29.857 --> 24:32.191
(man screaming)

24:45.505 --> 24:47.038
(gun clatters)

24:54.746 --> 24:56.213
Hey!

24:56.215 --> 24:59.216
Hey, I know you're down here!

24:59.218 --> 25:01.118
Come out, come out!

25:01.120 --> 25:02.653
Hey!

25:02.655 --> 25:04.188
Come out here!

25:04.190 --> 25:07.125
I know you're here!
I know you can see me!

25:07.127 --> 25:08.559
(horn sounding)

25:08.561 --> 25:12.330
(horn blaring)

25:36.187 --> 25:38.455
You're him.

25:44.904 --> 25:48.172
So, are we gonna
talk about it?

25:48.486 --> 25:49.919
You need to keep
this clean and dry.

25:49.921 --> 25:51.488
Avoidance.

25:51.490 --> 25:54.591
One of my favorite techniques.

25:54.593 --> 25:56.026
How about a drink?

25:56.028 --> 25:57.628
Can you drink?

25:57.630 --> 25:58.862
Not such a good idea.

25:58.864 --> 26:01.031
Maybe not for you.

26:01.033 --> 26:02.299
Look, my roommate is home...

26:02.301 --> 26:04.968
Hey, I-I-I promise
that I will be quiet.

26:04.970 --> 26:06.336
It's just...

26:06.338 --> 26:10.374
three people did just try
to kill me, and, uh...

26:10.376 --> 26:12.476
you killed two of them.

26:17.817 --> 26:19.618
I think we got beer.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.020
Great.

26:35.602 --> 26:37.902
It's just a hobby.

26:37.904 --> 26:40.038
Here.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.107
Um, yeah, my mom, she...

26:43.109 --> 26:45.009
she used to have this
stuff lying around, too.

26:45.011 --> 26:46.978
She's the one,

26:46.980 --> 26:48.713
nine years ago.

26:50.348 --> 26:52.116
So, um,

26:52.118 --> 26:55.620
what happened to you?

27:00.427 --> 27:02.895
Did someone do this to you?

27:02.897 --> 27:05.531
(faint voices echoing)

27:11.072 --> 27:12.739
I should've asked questions.

27:12.741 --> 27:15.575
(faint voices echoing)

27:15.577 --> 27:18.877
Any word
from your brothers?

27:18.879 --> 27:21.246
They're still trying
to get everyone out.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.882
(echoes): <i>They're still trying</i>
<i>to get everyone out.</i>

27:23.884 --> 27:25.484
But I was too angry.

27:25.486 --> 27:28.019
<i>Confused.</i>

27:28.021 --> 27:29.554
So you enlisted.

27:30.656 --> 27:31.622
Yeah.

27:31.624 --> 27:32.757
(closing door echoes)

27:32.759 --> 27:34.091
<i>Once I got over there,</i>

27:34.093 --> 27:35.292
I was tapped.

27:35.294 --> 27:37.494
<i>They told me</i>
<i>that I had the chance</i>

27:37.496 --> 27:38.662
<i>to be part of something great,</i>

27:38.664 --> 27:40.932
that I could make
a difference.

27:40.934 --> 27:43.568
It was called
Operation Muirfield.

27:52.944 --> 27:56.614
<i>They told us they were</i>
<i>vitamins, antibiotics,</i>

27:56.616 --> 27:58.649
steroids that would protect us.

27:58.651 --> 28:00.718
What were they?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.120
Like I said,
I should've asked questions.

28:02.122 --> 28:04.589
All I know is that
they changed our DNA.

28:04.591 --> 28:07.091
(automatic gunfire)
<i>They made us stronger,</i>

28:07.093 --> 28:10.794
faster... better.

28:11.796 --> 28:14.264
They heightened our
reflexes, our senses.

28:14.266 --> 28:15.833
That's why you could
smell the poison.

28:15.835 --> 28:17.134
Yeah.

28:17.136 --> 28:18.903
But something went wrong.

28:18.905 --> 28:23.141
<i>Anytime the adrenaline kicked</i>
<i>in, we became monsters.</i>

28:23.143 --> 28:24.842
<i>They couldn't stop us.</i>

28:24.844 --> 28:27.846
We couldn't stop us.

28:27.848 --> 28:29.781
So they gave orders
to shut it down,

28:29.783 --> 28:31.182
to eradicate us all.

28:31.184 --> 28:33.084
(chopper blades whirring)

28:33.086 --> 28:34.819
(men shouting)

28:34.821 --> 28:36.988
(explosion)

28:36.990 --> 28:38.923
How did you survive?

28:40.693 --> 28:41.859
Luck.

28:41.861 --> 28:43.127
(wry laugh)

28:44.196 --> 28:47.265
So... all of this...

28:47.267 --> 28:49.134
for an antidote.

28:49.136 --> 28:51.604
It doesn't work.

28:51.606 --> 28:54.506
You've just been
hiding out here?

28:54.508 --> 28:56.909
Yeah.

28:56.911 --> 29:00.145
JT's the only one I can trust.

29:00.147 --> 29:02.815
Except you, you go out there
and you save people.

29:02.817 --> 29:04.850
No.
No...

29:04.852 --> 29:06.952
you do.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.824
You saved me,

29:11.826 --> 29:14.761
and you tried to save
Ashley Webster.

29:16.931 --> 29:20.934
I guess it reminds me
of who I used to be.

29:20.936 --> 29:23.270
A doctor?

29:26.041 --> 29:28.676
Human.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.764
You should probably
leave now.

29:49.766 --> 29:53.133
Vincent, that night
nine years ago,

29:53.135 --> 29:56.102
why were you there...
I already told you more than I should.

29:56.104 --> 29:58.038
That agent on
the platform

29:58.040 --> 29:59.205
was from Muirfield, okay?

29:59.207 --> 30:00.840
You're on their radar.
Why?

30:00.842 --> 30:03.909
Vincent, does this have
something to do with my mom?

30:03.911 --> 30:06.045
I don't know anything
about your mom.

30:08.247 --> 30:09.914
I'm sorry, okay?

30:09.916 --> 30:11.815
But you can not come back here.

30:11.817 --> 30:13.784
It is too dangerous
for the both of us.

30:13.786 --> 30:15.052
No, I just...
Just go.

30:20.292 --> 30:23.361
Go.

30:47.176 --> 30:48.576
TESS: There you are.
I've been calling

30:48.578 --> 30:50.411
and calling you.

30:51.013 --> 30:53.114
Were you with Zeke?

30:53.116 --> 30:54.916
What?
That glow.

30:54.918 --> 30:56.084
What glow?

30:56.086 --> 30:57.986
The sex glow.
It's all over your face.

30:57.988 --> 30:59.354
I don't have a glow.

30:59.356 --> 31:01.289
I'm just excited.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.058
I found the murder weapon.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.194
Evan said he went
through everything.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.962
It's what's not here
that's important.

31:06.964 --> 31:08.264
Look, the sign-out sheet.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.665
Ashley signed out

31:09.667 --> 31:11.434
four products
the day before she died.

31:11.436 --> 31:14.136
Our guys only found three.

31:14.138 --> 31:16.237
Killer probably took
the fourth.

31:16.239 --> 31:19.040
So someone put poison
in Ashley's

31:19.042 --> 31:21.243
True to Color Blonde?

31:21.245 --> 31:22.811
CATHERINE:
Hey, Evan,

31:22.813 --> 31:24.313
any way to tell
if that nicotine

31:24.315 --> 31:26.048
was absorbed through
Taylor's scalp?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.783
I'll check her hair follicles.

31:27.785 --> 31:30.418
You do realize that I waited
for hours and hours last night?

31:30.420 --> 31:32.153
This one
stood me up.

31:32.155 --> 31:33.421
Oh, my God,
the premiere.

31:33.423 --> 31:36.091
Movie was lousy.
Good swag bag.

31:36.093 --> 31:37.760
Then I got called into here.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.862
My guys found these
in the power couple's bed.

31:39.864 --> 31:41.097
Oh. Bedbugs?

31:41.099 --> 31:43.132
That rash I showed you
was actually bites.

31:43.134 --> 31:45.201
Since these things
are little bloodsuckers,

31:45.203 --> 31:46.903
they carry the DNA

31:46.905 --> 31:48.737
of whoever's been rolling around
in those sheets.

31:48.739 --> 31:50.139
Your vic wasn't
pregnant.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.308
It was the hubby
that was stepping out.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.877
Can those mini vampires
tell us who with?

31:54.879 --> 31:56.646
Sorry, ladies,
we're not open yet.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.148
Actually, I'm
Detective Chandler,

31:58.150 --> 32:00.116
and this is
Detective Vargas.

32:00.118 --> 32:02.119
TESS: Alex's proofs from the
night his wife died--

32:02.121 --> 32:03.320
that was you.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.921
You were having
an affair with him.

32:06.290 --> 32:10.060
Alex told me
not to say anything.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.396
He said it would just make me
look guilty,

32:12.398 --> 32:14.132
especially 'cause
of the prenup.

32:14.134 --> 32:15.366
What prenup?

32:15.368 --> 32:16.834
If he cheats,

32:16.836 --> 32:18.936
he loses everything.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.404
But I didn't kill her, I swear.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.440
CATHERINE:
<i>It's not just this hostess.</i>

32:22.442 --> 32:24.776
We have bedbug DNA...
Hey!

32:24.778 --> 32:26.778
...from four other women.
I'm eating here!

32:26.780 --> 32:28.513
Alex Webster had
access to the poison,

32:28.515 --> 32:30.949
and he had motive-- the prenup.

32:30.951 --> 32:32.117
Except there was no prenup.

32:32.119 --> 32:35.021
I just read the forensic
accounting report.

32:35.023 --> 32:38.658
If he wanted out, all he had
to do was file for divorce.

32:39.527 --> 32:41.094
Now, if you will excuse me,

32:41.096 --> 32:43.296
I have some FBI nonsense
to deal with.

32:45.333 --> 32:46.499
(clears throat)

32:46.501 --> 32:48.001
Sir.

32:48.003 --> 32:50.170
What's going on?

32:50.172 --> 32:51.304
I don't know.

32:51.306 --> 32:52.972
Bodies from the subway.

32:52.974 --> 32:55.441
VINCENT: <i>The agents</i>
<i>on the platform were</i>

32:55.443 --> 32:56.976
from Muirfield. You
are on their radar.

32:56.978 --> 33:00.180
<i>It is too dangerous</i>
<i>for the both of us.</i>

33:09.391 --> 33:12.660
Don't see you guys
out here very often.

33:12.662 --> 33:14.195
What's the occasion?

33:14.197 --> 33:16.530
Just following orders,
Detective.

33:19.969 --> 33:23.405
Of course, we're gonna
need to take that back.

33:23.407 --> 33:26.743
Of course. Just making sure
you're not stealing our case.

33:32.517 --> 33:34.652
Detective Chandler.

33:51.036 --> 33:52.937
VINCENT:
Hey.

33:52.939 --> 33:55.172
(gasps)
Oh, my God, you scared me.

33:55.174 --> 33:57.375
You're the one snooping
around my place.

33:57.377 --> 33:59.376
Hey, some military guys
just showed up.

33:59.378 --> 34:01.412
They took the agents
from the platform away.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.314
You didn't talk to them, did you?
No. I asked them

34:03.316 --> 34:04.915
what they were doing,
and I came straight here.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.517
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have done that.

34:06.519 --> 34:08.152
I wasn't followed.
I needed to warn you.

34:08.155 --> 34:09.286
Look, you need to leave.

34:09.289 --> 34:11.456
No. Listen to me. Look,

34:11.458 --> 34:12.891
I lost my phone
on the platform.

34:12.893 --> 34:14.059
What if the Muirfield people

34:14.061 --> 34:15.860
have it, and they know
about you?

34:15.862 --> 34:18.130
This is why you have to
stop all contact with me.

34:18.132 --> 34:20.031
What about my mom?
I know what it's like

34:20.033 --> 34:22.367
to lose someone you love,
but you need to move on.

34:22.369 --> 34:24.168
You can't tell me
to just move on!

34:24.170 --> 34:25.603
Well, so what? You'll solve
your mother's murder,

34:25.606 --> 34:28.574
exact justice? Trust me,
it does not end well.

34:28.576 --> 34:30.042
Well, I'm gonna
take my chances.

34:30.043 --> 34:32.043
You don't get it, do you?!
No, I do!

34:32.045 --> 34:35.114
You can't tell me everything,
and that's fine.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.217
I don't need all the answers,
but last night--

34:37.219 --> 34:39.518
that was the first time
since my mom died

34:39.521 --> 34:41.420
that I haven't felt crazy.

34:41.422 --> 34:42.788
(inhales deeply)

34:44.824 --> 34:48.226
You are crazy
showing up here alone!

34:48.228 --> 34:51.530
I could kill you in less
than a second! Now go!

34:51.532 --> 34:53.533
(roars):
Go!

34:55.369 --> 34:57.536
(panting)

35:05.868 --> 35:08.236
CATHERINE: <i>Last night,</i>
<i>I realized that I was</i>

35:08.238 --> 35:10.973
thinking about your
wife's case the wrong way.

35:11.582 --> 35:14.483
Sometimes things
aren't what they seem.

35:14.485 --> 35:17.095
You can't tell
who the real monsters are.

35:17.096 --> 35:18.195
I didn't kill my wife.

35:18.197 --> 35:19.998
We just spoke
to a woman

35:20.000 --> 35:21.298
you're having an affair with,

35:21.300 --> 35:23.868
and I have DNA
that proves

35:23.870 --> 35:25.736
there are at least four others.

35:25.738 --> 35:28.706
You made every

35:28.708 --> 35:31.041
one of your women
fall in love with you

35:31.043 --> 35:33.643
and think that the only thing
standing in the way

35:33.645 --> 35:37.413
of their fairy tale ending
was some pretend prenup.

35:38.282 --> 35:40.216
Mr. Webster,

35:40.218 --> 35:42.551
I don't think
you killed your wife.

35:44.354 --> 35:47.455
But you are the reason
she's dead.

35:51.027 --> 35:52.160
I need a list of names.

35:52.162 --> 35:56.264
Everyone you slept with
during your marriage.

35:56.266 --> 35:58.433
You owe it to Ashley.

36:05.041 --> 36:07.109
Hey.

36:07.111 --> 36:09.144
Are you looking for Chloe?

36:09.146 --> 36:10.378
I'm her new assistant.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.881
Actually, Emily, uh,
we want to talk to you.

36:12.883 --> 36:15.717
CATHERINE: Look, we appreciate how
helpful you've been, but

36:15.719 --> 36:17.853
you forgot
to mention one thing.

36:17.855 --> 36:19.321
Alex.

36:19.323 --> 36:21.289
Alex?

36:21.291 --> 36:24.225
Alex Webster-- you were having
an affair with him.

36:24.227 --> 36:26.894
TESS: The missing pregnancy
tests-- we assumed

36:26.896 --> 36:28.897
they were Ashley's, but
you used them, didn't you?

36:28.899 --> 36:30.799
That's why you had
saltines in your purse.

36:30.801 --> 36:33.435
I don't know
what you're...

36:33.437 --> 36:34.869
The sign-out sheet.

36:34.871 --> 36:36.371
I'm pretty sure
if we showed this

36:36.373 --> 36:37.905
to an expert,
they'd confirm that

36:37.907 --> 36:40.975
this was you signing out
Ashley's True to Color Blond.

36:40.977 --> 36:42.410
No. Uh, Chloe ran the closet...

36:42.412 --> 36:44.246
You wanted us to
think it was her

36:44.248 --> 36:47.082
so that you could run off
into the sunset with Alex.

36:48.385 --> 36:50.119
But there was no prenup.

36:50.121 --> 36:52.188
That's impossible.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.723
He lied. Just
like he lied

36:53.725 --> 36:55.925
to all his women,
including the one

36:55.927 --> 36:58.394
that he was with the night
that you killed Ashley.

37:04.368 --> 37:06.837
I'm not even pregnant anymore.

37:06.839 --> 37:08.772
I lost it.

37:08.774 --> 37:10.240
You tell us where
the bottle is,

37:10.242 --> 37:12.509
we'll make sure that the DA
knows how remorseful you are.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.996
(distant siren wailing)

37:31.998 --> 37:33.997
Are we okay?

37:33.999 --> 37:36.233
You've been having
secret conversations,

37:36.235 --> 37:38.501
you executed that search
without me,

37:38.503 --> 37:40.970
and my brother's investigating
the subway case...

37:40.972 --> 37:43.506
he found this
on the platform.

37:43.508 --> 37:45.674
What were you doing
on the F train?

37:50.180 --> 37:52.414
All right, just forget it.

37:52.416 --> 37:54.250
Just know I'm here,
no judgments,

37:54.252 --> 37:55.351
you ever want to talk.

37:55.353 --> 37:58.187
Hey, it's Devil and Prada.
Nice work.

37:58.189 --> 38:00.189
Hey, as long
as I get to be Devil.

38:00.191 --> 38:02.992
So I'm not letting you
celebrate your big case

38:02.994 --> 38:04.594
alone at your father's
engagement party.

38:04.596 --> 38:06.029
What's the dress code?

38:06.031 --> 38:07.397
Evan, you don't have
to do that.

38:07.399 --> 38:09.099
Oh, come on. Free
drinks, and I'm assuming

38:09.101 --> 38:11.568
your vapid stepmother
insisted on a good caterer.

38:11.570 --> 38:13.103
You're just doing
this out of...

38:13.105 --> 38:15.238
Charity. Yeah,
poor little single girl.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.207
Did Tess tell you about Zeke?

38:17.209 --> 38:19.309
No, Joe did.

38:19.311 --> 38:21.044
How does Joe know?
(laughs) I don't know.

38:21.046 --> 38:22.179
But I wouldn't ask him now.

38:22.181 --> 38:23.480
He's just found out

38:23.482 --> 38:24.982
the department has to shell
out for a new spectrometer.

38:24.984 --> 38:28.486
Yeah, I took a look
over some old cases.

38:28.488 --> 38:31.488
Six more samples,

38:31.490 --> 38:33.824
all with the same
corrupted DNA.

38:33.826 --> 38:36.027
Six. Really?

38:36.029 --> 38:38.029
Yeah, so I guess
we'll see what's what

38:38.031 --> 38:39.564
once we get our
new spectrometer.

38:39.566 --> 38:42.601
Maybe you weren't
so crazy after all.

38:53.180 --> 38:56.215
Right there.
What are you gonna do?

38:58.118 --> 39:00.520
Check.

39:00.522 --> 39:02.655
(footsteps approaching)

39:03.624 --> 39:06.259
Hi.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.096
Hi.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.265
Hi?

39:12.267 --> 39:14.134
H-Hi?

39:14.136 --> 39:16.236
Did I miss something,

39:16.238 --> 39:18.371
or...?
JT, you mind?

39:26.580 --> 39:28.981
Wow.

39:28.983 --> 39:30.616
Just, you look...

39:30.618 --> 39:32.652
I have an engagement party.

39:32.654 --> 39:34.354
Right.

39:34.356 --> 39:38.291
Look, I know you're gonna
try to kick me out. I get it.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.128
I-I get what it's
like to hide out

39:41.130 --> 39:44.665
and push people away 'cause
you don't feel deserving.

39:46.602 --> 39:50.571
Do you know why I keep
asking about my mom?

39:50.573 --> 39:54.175
Because I'm the reason
that she's dead.

39:56.112 --> 40:00.682
If I hadn't left the stupid
vanity mirror open...

40:01.517 --> 40:05.153
But, Vincent,
I just found

40:05.155 --> 40:07.222
six cases of you

40:07.224 --> 40:09.625
trying to save victims
around the city.

40:09.627 --> 40:13.295
You're not a monster.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.365
I would know.

40:16.367 --> 40:19.635
There are a lot of guys
out there that are, but...

40:21.405 --> 40:24.407
You saved my life.

40:24.409 --> 40:26.610
Twice.

40:28.312 --> 40:30.781
Catherine, wait.

40:30.783 --> 40:33.250
You're not the reason
your mom's dead.

40:33.252 --> 40:36.086
They were tracking her.

40:36.088 --> 40:39.724
I'm not sure why,
but it wasn't your fault.

40:41.193 --> 40:43.661
