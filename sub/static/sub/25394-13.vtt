Previously onSalvation...Behold the savior

00:03.699 --> 00:05.005
of the human race.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.093
Dear God.

00:07.094 --> 00:10.053
You destroyed the rail gun.No, you did.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.012
You gave us the plans.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.926
We still have 58 days
to knock that bloody

00:13.970 --> 00:15.406
space rock off its course.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.060
DARIUS: I do have one last card
left to play.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
So we're gonna take
a giant rocket ship,

00:18.844 --> 00:20.803
bulk up its mass,
and...

00:20.846 --> 00:22.239
ram it into the asteroid.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.893
But our scientists believe
Tanz's plan

00:23.936 --> 00:26.069
has a 20% chance of success.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
Those federal bunkers,
there's a spot for me,

00:28.115 --> 00:30.987
but I can also bring
my spouse and our children.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.989
Grace, will you marry me?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.730
The rail gun slugs
you fired,

00:34.773 --> 00:36.079
they're not gonna hit
the asteroid.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.386
The math is correct.

00:38.429 --> 00:39.996
I personally checked it all.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.606
The calculations used
to program the rail gun

00:41.650 --> 00:43.608
are the same ones we'll need
to pilot the Ark,

00:43.652 --> 00:45.001
and if they're off,
then plan C...

00:45.045 --> 00:46.829
Is no plan at all.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.571
You're going up in the Ark?
It's a suicide mission.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.312
Whatever time I have left,

00:51.355 --> 00:53.009
I want to spend with you.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.706
The Ark is half mine!

00:54.750 --> 00:57.318
I am the only one
with the launch code.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.494
No way in hell
I'll ever give it to you.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.497
It's a sonic weapon.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.020
Cover your ears!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.196
Hello.JILLIAN :
Liam, it's me.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.025
They have Darius.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.028
DARIUS:
Hummingbird.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.030
What are you doing?!

01:14.074 --> 01:17.686
I am Noah, and I believe
you have my Ark.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.516
DARIUS:
What did I miss?

01:21.559 --> 01:25.476
Something.
It was right there.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.655
No...

01:30.699 --> 01:33.180
It all adds up.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.095
Does it, though?

01:37.923 --> 01:38.968
You promised you'd solve it.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.145
You failed, Darius.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.147
No, no, no, it's not over yet.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.018
I-I, I just need
a little more time.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.107
We're out of time.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.021
You're a fraud, Darius.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.240
Never work for your heroes.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.416
No, I-I'm-I'm not wrong.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.550
Why? Because the great
Darius Tanz can never be wrong?

01:56.377 --> 01:57.247
I believed in you.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.859
Wait. Wait, don't go.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.166
I've almost got the answer.
If I can--

02:03.210 --> 02:05.777
If I can just solve for X...GRACE: You failed, Darius.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.344
HARRIS: We're out of time. ALYCIA: You're a fraud, Darius.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.041
The hummingbird is X.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.613
JILLIAN:
Never work for your heroes.

02:22.403 --> 02:26.494
I just need to solve for X.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.194
I'm not wrong.
I can't be.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.544
:
Darius.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.851
Please stay with me.

02:35.894 --> 02:39.202
I'm gonna get you
out of here...

02:39.246 --> 02:41.944
if it's the last thing I do.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.172
Stop checking your phone.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.044
We need to confirm
these mass and velocity numbers.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.438
How am I supposed to worry
about math right now?

02:57.481 --> 03:00.092
They'll get him back.
Safe.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.051
And even if we can figure out
how to close

03:02.094 --> 03:04.009
the communication gap
with the Ark,

03:04.053 --> 03:09.101
Darius comes home and, what,
he hops on a suicide mission?

03:09.145 --> 03:12.104
We still have time to figure out
the communication gap.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.105
It's not over yet.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.544
TESS:
Ark hangar security breach.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.546
Alycia, look.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.332
What the hell?MAN: Out of the way,

03:22.376 --> 03:23.464
get out of the way.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.553
We're under siege.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.163
We got to move.
Come on.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.470
MAN:
Get on the ground!

03:29.513 --> 03:30.514
Get down!

03:30.558 --> 03:32.299
On the ground now!

03:39.131 --> 03:41.612
Hello, Liam.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.138
I told you we'd meet again soon.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.270
You two?

03:47.314 --> 03:48.967
NICHOLAS:
Secure them.

03:49.011 --> 03:49.968
Hey!

03:50.012 --> 03:52.057
BASS:
Liam...
Please.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.234
...it's time to accept.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.849
:
Darius, we have to move now.

04:00.892 --> 04:05.636
No. I can't leave my work.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.942
Where are you going?

04:06.985 --> 04:09.292
What does it matter,
Nora? They left.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.730
Bass and the rest
of the selects, they're gone.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.297
They're coming back for me.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.299
Bass said I was chosen
for Salvation.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.302
It's a lie.
They used us.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.392
Like you used me?
I know you took my key.

04:22.436 --> 04:26.309
I know you snuck out.
I will not be abandoned.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.314
MAN:
Lay down your weapon...Stay there.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.403
...and come out of the building
with your hands over your head.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.491
Don't move.
I'll shoot.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.319
I swear!
Aah!

04:38.190 --> 04:40.018
MAN:
Clear left

04:41.368 --> 04:43.326
I got 'em.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.545
Alonzo, I'm so sorry.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.983
Darius?

04:48.026 --> 04:50.159
Oh, my God.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.856
I tried to stop them,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.771
but they tortured him.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.165
For what?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.428
The launch codes.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.909
They want the Ark.

05:00.952 --> 05:04.478
But you didn't give
them up... did you?

05:17.882 --> 05:19.449
Salvation...

05:19.493 --> 05:22.234
at last.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.674
This can't be happening!

05:26.717 --> 05:29.241
This can't be
happening.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.898
We have to stop them.Darius, hold on.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.683
We got you.Grace.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.293
Let's get him out
of here.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.556
Darius?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.471
Sit him back down.

05:41.515 --> 05:42.864
Darius?

05:42.907 --> 05:45.345
Darius?

05:48.957 --> 05:52.526
Where am I?

05:52.569 --> 05:56.007
Mr. Tanz,
it's all right.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.270
Just relax.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.493
He's awake.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.893
Grace.

06:11.936 --> 06:15.723
I'm right here.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.770
I thought I'd lost you.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.253
I need to get
word to Liam.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.604
Bass and Nick want the Ark.
We need to get to Tanz.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.127
Wait.
No, it can't wait.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.128
Get me out of here
before it's too late.

06:30.172 --> 06:34.437
Darius...
it is too late.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.266
The Ark is gone.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.617
No. No, this is just a dream.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.619
I'm gonna wake up.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.849
H

06:54.892 --> 06:57.634
44 days.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.637
44 days?

07:00.681 --> 07:03.031
You had a seizure, and you've
been sleeping ever since.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.381
That means that the asteroid
is going to hit...

07:05.425 --> 07:07.775
In three days.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.907
We're three days away

07:09.951 --> 07:12.780
from the end of the world
as we know it.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.613
♪

07:32.887 --> 07:35.237
It's just a painkiller,
Mr. Tanz, for the headaches.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.021
No, no, I don't want anything.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.327
I need to--
I need to think straight.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.590
What the hell did
they do to him?

07:40.634 --> 07:42.505
Sonic torture is a brutal
but effective way

07:42.549 --> 07:45.508
of breaking someone down
without leaving scars.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.642
Expect headaches,
memory loss, hallucinations.

07:48.685 --> 07:51.645
It's like he suffered
a major concussion.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.603
Ms. Barrows,
we're getting ready

07:53.647 --> 07:55.344
to close down here
at the Pentagon.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.606
People are going home
to their families.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.216
Of course. Thank you
for everything

07:58.260 --> 08:00.392
you and your staff
have done.
Mm-hmm.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.140
Grace, what's the plan

08:09.184 --> 08:11.142
How are we planning
on stopping the asteroid

08:11.186 --> 08:14.015
without the Ark?

08:14.058 --> 08:16.887
We're not.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.064
Nuclear weapons?

08:20.108 --> 08:22.458
That's insane.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.981
They'll destroy the planet,

08:24.025 --> 08:25.940
breaking the asteroid
into pieces,

08:25.983 --> 08:27.724
killing billions.Yes, I know.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.421
We all know.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.555
Frankly, we're
out of options.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.863
People are taking refuge in
bunkers all over the world.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.735
Yet you're still here.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.216
Till tonight.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.610
You and Harris...

08:43.653 --> 08:46.743
We're supposed to move into
the government compound

08:46.787 --> 08:48.745
with Zoe.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.141
Darius.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.230
Darius?

09:00.148 --> 09:04.674
Grace...
we can't launch those nukes.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.546
What?

09:07.764 --> 09:09.940
Wait, wha...?

09:09.984 --> 09:12.029
I need to talk
to the White House.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.512
Now.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.688
HARRIS:
We've determined that

09:18.732 --> 09:20.560
one coordinated nuclear
explosion

09:20.603 --> 09:22.344
will be the most effective,

09:22.387 --> 09:24.694
controlled from one central hub,
the Pentagon.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.306
DARIUS: It's madness,
what you're planning.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.395
Mr. Tanz.Darius.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.354
Nuking the asteroid,
you're dooming the planet.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.225
Actually, we're saving
the planet.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.270
Mr. Tanz,
our scientists assure us,

09:35.313 --> 09:36.924
this is the best course
of action.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.316
Well, they're wrong.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.362
We've assembled an
international coalition

09:40.405 --> 09:42.756
of every nuclear power;
it's historic what...

09:42.799 --> 09:45.497
Historic ineptitude
is what it is!

09:45.541 --> 09:48.588
You'll blow it to bits,
create enough shrapnel

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
to wipe out billions!

09:53.070 --> 09:54.332
So, what are you
suggesting?

09:54.376 --> 09:57.771
We just wait for impact?

09:57.814 --> 10:02.427
What if I told you
that you don't have

10:02.471 --> 10:04.386
to launch those nukes?

10:04.429 --> 10:07.955
That the asteroid
is not going to hit Earth.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.959
What?

10:13.743 --> 10:16.354
I've been running
the calculations in my head

10:16.398 --> 10:18.574
why the rail gun slugs
never hit.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.360
There's a reason,
because the original math

10:22.404 --> 10:28.279
was correct,
which tells me there's some...

10:28.323 --> 10:31.065
some gravitational anomaly

10:31.108 --> 10:33.415
or some unseen dark matter

10:33.458 --> 10:35.591
that's causing
the asteroid to...

10:35.635 --> 10:40.161
to move off its initial course.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.467
GRACE: Wait, you're saying
the rail gun slugs missed

10:42.511 --> 10:45.993
because the asteroid's
course has shifted?

10:46.036 --> 10:47.472
HARRIS:
Impossible.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.431
All right, DoD has been running
calculations for months.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.172
It's the only explanation.

10:52.869 --> 10:57.482
The answer is in the math,
which I'm trying to solve.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.441
There's
something there.

10:59.484 --> 11:03.271
Darius, can you give us
something concrete?

11:03.314 --> 11:05.534
Anything that can be verified?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.364
DARIUS:
I'm working on it.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.105
Hey, I'm nearly there.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.411
It's just, uh,

11:13.455 --> 11:17.198
I just need to solve for X...

11:17.241 --> 11:19.548
TREY: Mr. Tanz?
Unless you can prove

11:19.591 --> 11:21.289
with some certainty
that what you say is true,

11:21.332 --> 11:23.683
with three days to go,
we have to do the only thing

11:23.726 --> 11:26.990
that can save some semblance of
humanity and launch those nukes.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.558
We load the bunkers up
tonight.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.908
We launch those nukes
in 12 hours.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.912
Godspeed, everyone.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.097
GRACE: Darius?

11:47.141 --> 11:49.360
What you said in there.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.799
You really believe
Samson will miss us?

11:52.842 --> 11:57.412
I won't know until
I follow this last theory.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.288
But I need help, Grace.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.856
My head's not right.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.293
HARRIS:
Exactly.

12:09.337 --> 12:13.471
Why are you filling Grace's head
with nonsense?

12:13.515 --> 12:14.995
It's not nonsense.

12:15.038 --> 12:18.346
It's a mystery to be solved.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.174
As all science is.

12:22.742 --> 12:27.268
Harris, if there's
even a scintilla of hope,

12:27.311 --> 12:28.835
I got to follow it.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.318
We need to get to that
survival bunker tonight...

12:35.972 --> 12:38.627
...if we don't want
to lose those spaces.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.067
Let me know what you decide.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.384
What now, mad scientist?

12:58.212 --> 13:00.562
Liam.
What?

13:01.606 --> 13:03.173
Darius.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.566
Get off your asses, people.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.437
It ain't over till it's over.

13:10.485 --> 13:14.837
The asteroid, I don't think
is gonna hit us.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.971
I have 12 hours to prove
that to the Pentagon

13:18.014 --> 13:20.016
before they launch nukes that
will destroy the world...

13:20.060 --> 13:22.410
Is that all?Wait. Hold on, slow down.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.803
LIAM:
How is that possible?

13:23.846 --> 13:26.196
If I slow down,
we run out of time.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.417
I... I need you
to not ask questions.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.246
Just do what I tell you.Okay. Okay.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.204
What do you need?

13:34.248 --> 13:35.640
I want you to hack

13:35.684 --> 13:37.468
the government's nuclear weapons
upon launch.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.557
The way RE/SYST hacked
the Russian missiles?

13:39.601 --> 13:41.298
There isn't enough time.

13:41.342 --> 13:45.041
If RE/SYST did it once,
then you can do it again.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.303
No, that was all Nero.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.305
He masterminded
that entire escapade.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.829
DARIUS:
Then track him down.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.613
Have you forgotten
they disowned me?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.528
And I don't even know who he is.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.399
But you're the best.
You can do it. Figure it out.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.792
Meantime, Grace, come with me.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.489
Where are we going?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.883
We need to find a hummingbird.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.712
Now.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.323
Figure it out?

14:08.543 --> 14:09.761
RADIO HOST: As final
preparations are being made

14:09.805 --> 14:11.807
for the asteroid's
impending arrival,

14:11.851 --> 14:15.158
businesses are closed and
families are hunkering down.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.333
This is our final broadcast

14:16.377 --> 14:19.510
for WDCC, Washington, D.C.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.556
See you on the other side.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.602
At least I don't have to worry
about finding a parking spot.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.656
:
Okay.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.833
GRACE:
Darius?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.617
You still haven't told me

14:39.661 --> 14:41.924
what this has to do
with the asteroid.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.754
That's because
I don't know... yet.

14:45.797 --> 14:49.410
My unconscious mind is trying
to tell me something.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.760
To, to solve X.

14:51.803 --> 14:55.938
X, X, and X is
th

14:55.982 --> 14:58.810
No. The hummingbird's
the metaphor.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.988
For a long time,

15:02.031 --> 15:05.687
scientists believed
hummingbirds defied physics.

15:05.730 --> 15:09.865
It turns out, they just didn't
understand the physics involved.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.911
♪ Why do the stars glow above?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
There they are.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.700
♪ Don't they know

15:18.743 --> 15:22.356
♪ It's the end of the world?

15:22.399 --> 15:26.273
♪ It ended when I lost your...

15:26.316 --> 15:28.884
ALYCIA:
He's frozen me out.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.887
What? I can't believe
he's ignoring you.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.758
This is the end of the world.
You said it's urgent.

15:33.802 --> 15:36.283
Well, for all we know,
he's gone underground by now.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.849
Just like everyone else.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.330
Okay, well, you must
have some idea who it is.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.290
Right

15:43.333 --> 15:47.598
It's not quite that simple.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.470
Alycia, this isn't
the time to be coy.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.254
We are hours away
from annihilation.

15:51.298 --> 15:54.127
Okay, listen, Nero is a title.
Not a person.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.390
Meaning?

15:56.433 --> 15:59.959
The mask gets passed
from one leader to the next,

16:00.002 --> 16:02.309
without the rank
and file members

16:02.352 --> 16:05.138
knowing the exact identity.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.837
So no one person
gets too much power.

16:10.665 --> 16:14.016
You know I was next in line?

16:14.060 --> 16:18.586
Until I was burned.

16:18.629 --> 16:22.677
All this loyalty to an
organization, I don't get it.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.898
RE/SYST... was the closest thing
to family

16:26.942 --> 16:29.771
that I've ever known.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.602
Or a loving relationship,
for that matter.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.518
Alycia.

16:37.561 --> 16:41.522
I know
you still love her.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.046
Jillian.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.791
And it's okay.

16:49.834 --> 16:54.665
Thank you for riding out
the apocalypse with me.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.495
There's not gonna be
an apocalypse.

16:58.539 --> 17:02.325
We just need
to get Nero to bite.

17:07.678 --> 17:10.768
Oh, my God.

17:19.734 --> 17:23.825
I know a hummingbird won't
save the world, Grace.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.828
But it came to you in a vision.

17:26.871 --> 17:31.050
Yes, a-a message
from my unconscious mind,

17:31.093 --> 17:32.834
which I'm trying to unlock.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.836
Now, scientists throughout
history have cracked

17:34.879 --> 17:36.620
their greatest conundrums
through dreams, metaphors.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.100
Bohr, Kekulé, even Einstein.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
He dreamt the theory
of relativity

17:39.667 --> 17:41.712
long before he ever
figured it out.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.627
Imagine that.He saw himself

17:43.671 --> 17:46.021
sledding down a snowy mountain
faster than the speed of light

17:46.065 --> 17:48.545
so that the stars would change
their appearance around him.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.331
And now Darius Tanz

17:51.374 --> 17:55.204
has his dream
to follow?

17:57.815 --> 17:59.687
What about you?

17:59.730 --> 18:03.386
What... dream
are you following?

18:05.388 --> 18:09.914
Harris, the marriage--
I did it for Zoe.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.438
So she could have a safe place

18:11.481 --> 18:15.833
and, I don't know,
maybe some hope.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.662
And you're going with them?

18:18.706 --> 18:21.187
Unless you can give
me a reason not to.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.854
I'm working on it.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.902
ZOE:
Mom.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.251
Darius.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.254
Wh

18:45.298 --> 18:48.953
Ah... there it is.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.782
There it is. There it is.

18:51.826 --> 18:55.395
What?Hummingbirds shouldn't be able
to fly, yet they can.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.092
The rail gun shouldn't
have missed,

18:57.136 --> 18:58.963
yet it did.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.269
I'm so close

19:00.313 --> 19:02.315
to a breakthrough,
I can feel it.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.014
Darius? Darius.

19:12.063 --> 19:16.720
DARIUS: They change direction,
on any plane,

19:16.764 --> 19:21.421
and move back, as if they
haven't moved at all.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.859
As if they're just hovering.

19:24.902 --> 19:28.210
But the human eye
can't see it.

19:28.254 --> 19:33.520
The human eye can't see it.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.870
That's it.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.612
Grace!

19:38.655 --> 19:40.222
That's it.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.224
What does it mean?

19:42.268 --> 19:45.662
We need to call Antarctica.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.883
We need to call
Antarctica.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.496
Mom, is Darius okay

19:55.498 --> 19:56.847
I don't know.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.033
Should've hooked this thing up
a long time ago.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.907
Uh, Darius?

20:12.950 --> 20:16.040
What, uh...

20:16.084 --> 20:17.651
what's in Antarctica?

20:17.694 --> 20:19.130
Ice T. Not the rapper.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.871
A facility
that studies neutrinos.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.133
Neutrinos.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.918
Invisible high-energy
subatomic particles

20:23.961 --> 20:26.921
given off by-by massive
expenditures of energy,

20:26.964 --> 20:28.575
you know,
like, li-like supernova,

20:28.618 --> 20:29.924
black holes, that
sort of thing.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.274
The lead researcher, Dr. Carson.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.798
I need to talk to him.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.759
Hopefully, he is still there.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.289
WENDELL:
Oh, crap. Hold on.

20:47.333 --> 20:51.293
International Consortium of
Transient Extreme Astrophysics,

20:51.337 --> 20:52.686
Dr. Wendell Carson.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
Please hold.Carson.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.777
It's me, Darius Tanz.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.300
Tanz?

20:58.344 --> 21:01.303
I haven't seen you
since you were on TV.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.914
You were president,
then you weren't.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.699
That was weird.

21:05.742 --> 21:08.919
Carson, there isn't much time.
I-I-I need you to sober up.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.225
Fat chance.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.793
They left me here, Tanz. To die.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.142
Carson, I'll send
people for you,

21:14.185 --> 21:17.319
the entire cavalry,
if you can just help me here.

21:17.363 --> 21:22.019
Did you record
any unusual neutrino bursts

21:22.063 --> 21:23.499
in the last few weeks?

21:23.543 --> 21:25.066
Something in the...

21:25.109 --> 21:29.679
in-in the ecliptic plane
in Leo?

21:29.723 --> 21:32.378
Neutrino spikes?Yes.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.336
Oh, hell if I know.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.643
Hey, are you all right, Tanz?

21:36.686 --> 21:38.253
You look like you could use
a drink, too.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.864
Hey, Dr. Carson.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.911
Hi. Uh, Grace Barrows,
White House Senior Advisor.

21:43.954 --> 21:47.044
I'm gonna need you
to get yourself some coffee.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.743
And get Mr. Tanz
the information he needs.

21:49.786 --> 21:52.049
This is the difference
between life and death,

21:52.093 --> 21:54.051
between the survival
of the planet

21:54.095 --> 21:56.097
and the end of the world
as we know it.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.882
Give me an hour, some caffeine,

21:58.926 --> 22:00.841
and, uh, I'll look over
the hard data.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.626
I-I'll ring you back
when I have an answer.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.803
Okay, thank you.

22:06.847 --> 22:10.154
Grace, I need, um...What?

22:10.198 --> 22:14.463
I need to, uh...
I-I need to sleep.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.381
Here?
Yes.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.603
Grace.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.780
How much time do we have left
until they...

22:26.823 --> 22:28.172
until they launch those nukes?

22:30.087 --> 22:31.088
Seven hours.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.181
There's something
I need you to do for me.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.577
Nothing

22:41.621 --> 22:44.145
Come on, Alycia, there has to be
some other way.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.799
I've tried
everything.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.410
I've checked the old IRC rooms,
I've sent up flares,

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
I've even left messages
at the old dead drops.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.066
Okay, what if,
what if we went public?

22:52.109 --> 22:52.980
What if we
broadcasted wide?

22:53.023 --> 22:56.070
Liam.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.468
You could be in Rhode Island

23:02.511 --> 23:06.080
in a few hours, in time
to be with your mom.

23:06.123 --> 23:09.518
We can't give up,
Alycia, not now.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.999
We're not...
giving up.

23:12.042 --> 23:15.568
All I'm saying is

23:15.611 --> 23:17.134
that everyone should be

23:17.178 --> 23:19.441
with someone they love
in the end.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.752
That's him, that's him.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.188
NERO:
LadyHawk,

23:27.231 --> 23:29.190
Galileo, aren't you two
a pretty pair?

23:29.233 --> 23:31.714
You have 60 seconds.
What do you want?

23:31.758 --> 23:34.195
Darius Tanz has a plan, but the
clock is ticking, literally,

23:34.238 --> 23:36.197
and I have to believe
that you do not want

23:36.240 --> 23:37.894
to incinerate the planet
any more than we do.

23:37.938 --> 23:40.201
So what is this plan?

23:40.244 --> 23:42.203
He doesn't think the asteroid
is going to hit,

23:42.246 --> 23:44.684
and he needs us, you,
to hack those nukes,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.294
like you did before,

23:46.337 --> 23:48.383
and stop them destroying
the planet unnecessarily.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.125
Why should I believe
anything you say?

23:51.168 --> 23:52.431
It's the end of the world.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.172
Why would I lie to you?
Nero, bury the hatchet.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.957
Before I do what you ask,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.002
I'll need to verify
what you're saying.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.090
How are you
gonna do that?

24:00.134 --> 24:01.135
Leave that to me.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.703
I'll be in touch shortly.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.620
We got to
tell Darius.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.691
One box. That's all we're
allowed in the bunker.

24:35.735 --> 24:39.695
Hard to decide
what to take...

24:40.696 --> 24:43.351
...what to leave.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.093
Harris...
Don't.

24:46.136 --> 24:49.096
No apologies.

24:49.139 --> 24:52.142
We had a deal.
This was an arrangement

24:52.186 --> 24:56.712
to keep you, Zoe,
our grandchild safe.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.106
Whatever's going on with you
and Darius doesn't change that.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.674
What's going on is that
I'm trying to help him.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.197
Help us.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.634
And-and I will do everything
and anything to stop...

25:05.678 --> 25:06.635
The inevitable?

25:06.679 --> 25:08.550
Grace.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.727
Darius is talking nonsense.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.555
All right, he's not well.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.731
Maybe... or maybe not.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.299
God, Grace, it's time

25:18.342 --> 25:19.779
to let go.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.650
Look, this is not a dream, okay?

25:21.694 --> 25:23.434
This is reality.
We need to face it.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.480
The one thing that's kept me
going all this time,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.221
the one and only thing, is hope.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.267
And, yes, the shades are
drawn, it's dark out there,

25:30.311 --> 25:32.139
but there's still a sliver
of light coming through,

25:32.182 --> 25:35.011
and until that's gone,
I'm not giving up on this world.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.839
I'm sorry, I'm just not.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.587
Now, Darius asked me to do
one more thing for him.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.241
Oh, God.I need to see Jillian.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.808
She's still
in lockup.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.201
I'm aware. Isn't it time
you let her go?

25:51.245 --> 25:54.509
The government decided

25:54.553 --> 25:56.293
not to release prisoners,
in case...

25:56.337 --> 25:58.121
In case what?
The asteroid doesn't hit?

25:58.165 --> 26:01.037
It's either coming
or it's not.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.387
Make up your mind.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.351
Grace.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.531
Are you okay?
Yeah.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.186
Hey, Darius.
Darius, we found him.

26:19.229 --> 26:22.189
We found Nero.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.931
Liam.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.976
Darius?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.155
Are you...

26:32.199 --> 26:33.679
Shh.

26:33.722 --> 26:36.333
We tracked down Nero, asked
him to hack nuclear weapons,

26:36.377 --> 26:37.508
and you're sleeping?

26:37.552 --> 26:40.207
Thinking.
Putting the pieces together.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.339
Waiting for Ice T,
not the rapper or the drink.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.429
Darius, everyone is running
around like headless chickens

26:45.473 --> 26:47.518
'cause you said the asteroid
is not going to hit.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.130
Yes. The hummingbirds led me

26:50.173 --> 26:53.350
to Ice T and neutrinos and...

26:53.394 --> 26:55.135
Now I'm nursing
an incredible headache,

26:55.178 --> 26:59.008
which I'm trying to work
through, if you don't mind.

27:06.059 --> 27:10.150
Jillian, the rail gun.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.805
Something went wrong.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.503
It wouldn't have
worked anyway.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.331
Darius wanted you to know

27:17.374 --> 27:21.117
not to blame yourself
for what's happening.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.338
It would have
happened anyway.

27:26.993 --> 27:30.257
Oh, my God.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.521
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.135
I tried to keep him safe.He knows that.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.181
He knows that.

27:44.619 --> 27:48.405
I need you to tell me something.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.407
When Darius was in that room,

27:50.451 --> 27:52.409
did you notice him having

27:52.453 --> 27:54.455
any hallucinations?

27:55.891 --> 27:57.719
Yes.

27:57.763 --> 28:01.201
Did he say anything coherent

28:01.244 --> 28:03.377
while he was incoherent?

28:03.420 --> 28:06.641
Oh, um, God,
I don't know.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.427
He mentioned hummingbirds,
like, a lot.
Yeah.

28:10.471 --> 28:13.474
That much I got.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.519
Is there anything else
you can remember?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.436
I don't know.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.702
He said, "Get ready," like...

28:23.745 --> 28:25.399
like he was preparing
for something.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.271
Get ready... for what?

28:30.534 --> 28:32.754
JILLIAN:
Grace.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.234
Can you call my
dad and, um...

28:34.277 --> 28:37.063
and tell him that I love him?

28:37.106 --> 28:40.240
Can you tell him

28:40.283 --> 28:44.461
that I'm sorry
for everything?

28:49.292 --> 28:51.817
Grace doesn't need
to tell him.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.168
You should
do it yourself.

28:57.561 --> 29:01.261
You're free
to go, Jillian.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.751
Harris. Thank you
for doing that.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.237
They're shutting
power down.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.370
Grace, there's no
new information.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.850
Nothing's going
to change.

29:24.893 --> 29:28.201
We have to report to that bunker
in less than five hours.

29:28.244 --> 29:29.811
Are you coming with me or not?

29:29.855 --> 29:33.336
I have to get this information
back to Darius.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.598
"Get ready."

29:34.642 --> 29:37.123
It could mean something.
If there's a reason

29:37.166 --> 29:39.212
not to launch those nukes,
we shouldn't do it.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.214
Grace, the only thing standing

29:41.257 --> 29:43.433
between us
and the end of humanity

29:43.477 --> 29:46.436
are those nukes,
and I intend to launch them,

29:46.480 --> 29:47.960
no matter what.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.570
DYLAN:
Not if I have anything to say

29:49.613 --> 29:51.093
about it.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.317
Dylan?

29:58.405 --> 30:00.450
Hey, Dad.

30:07.893 --> 30:13.507
Do you have any idea how much
agony you've put me through?

30:13.550 --> 30:15.770
You could've let me
know you were alive.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.774
It was my turn to assume
the mantle of Nero.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.821
I did what I had to do
to protect our work

30:22.864 --> 30:24.561
and my life.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.173
The government killed our
people, or have you forgotten?

30:27.216 --> 30:30.698
You were behind
all of it?

30:30.741 --> 30:33.614
RE/SYST, taking the world
hostage with those nukes.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.659
I used my army
like you used yours,

30:35.703 --> 30:38.271
to get things done,
and we did.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.751
We built a solar sail
with international cooperation.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.667
You threatened to drop nuclear
weapons on New York City.

30:43.711 --> 30:44.886
It was a bluff.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.845
All of it was.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.238
I never intended
to hurt anyone.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.632
Why come back now?

30:51.675 --> 30:55.027
I'm being asked
to hack those nukes

30:55.070 --> 30:57.638
to stop you from
destroying the planet.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.597
Asked

31:00.641 --> 31:02.861
Darius Tanz.

31:07.735 --> 31:11.260
:
This... this is insanity.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.262
Literally.

31:13.306 --> 31:16.526
There was a time
where I would've done it

31:16.570 --> 31:17.788
just because it was you.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.965
But...

31:20.008 --> 31:22.489
it's the end, Dad.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.969
The stakes are way too high,

31:24.012 --> 31:27.668
and... I'm gonna be a father.

31:27.711 --> 31:30.497
You know?I went to see Zoe

31:30.540 --> 31:33.892
to say good-bye,
and she told me everything.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.373
Dylan.

31:37.417 --> 31:40.333
The leaders of the world
have come together

31:40.376 --> 31:42.770
to make one last attempt
to save humanity,

31:42.813 --> 31:45.294
exactly what
RE/SYST wanted.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.817
Credible,
thoughtful minds

31:46.861 --> 31:48.689
have come to this consensus,

31:48.732 --> 31:52.171
and Darius is anything but
right now.

31:52.214 --> 31:55.870
We all wish there was
a better way,

31:55.914 --> 31:57.959
but the time
for wishful thinking is over.

32:01.658 --> 32:04.139
Zoe and I,

32:04.183 --> 32:06.837
we're in this
together.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.927
And I want to be with
her no matter what.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.495
HARRIS:
And you should be.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.980
I have a place
for you in a bunker.

32:19.024 --> 32:22.941
I want you to take my spot,
but, Dylan, those nukes,

32:22.984 --> 32:25.856
they are the last
best hope we have.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.249
And in five hours,

32:27.293 --> 32:29.904
I'm going down to that war room
and doing my job.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.950
Come hell
or high water.

32:33.908 --> 32:38.695
What the rest of you do,
it's up to you.

33:01.414 --> 33:05.200
ALYCIA:
Liam?

33:05.244 --> 33:10.162
We need to tell Nero
to call this off.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.779
Liam, look at him.

33:18.822 --> 33:22.826
He's making no sense.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.221
Those nukes will at least give
the people in the bunkers

33:26.265 --> 33:27.831
a fighting chance.

33:29.920 --> 33:34.229
My last hours,
and I let... Don Quixote

33:34.273 --> 33:37.711
take me on another one
of his wild rides.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.804
I'm sorry.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.068
Everything we've done...

33:50.985 --> 33:55.163
...solar sails, gravity
tractors, EmDrives, rail guns,

33:55.207 --> 33:57.426
what the hell has
any of it amounted to?

33:59.907 --> 34:01.909
Nothing.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.873
:
Nothing.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.791
Nothing!

34:14.835 --> 34:16.097
Nothing!

34:16.141 --> 34:19.057
Nothing!

34:19.100 --> 34:20.841
Nothing!

34:32.200 --> 34:33.984
It's over.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.900
I'm sorry.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.163
JILLIAN:
Liam?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.562
Jillian.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.577
I came to say good-bye.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.756
Don't go. Please.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.933
GRACE: You sure this is what you want?

35:09.977 --> 35:11.761
To be with him?

35:13.198 --> 35:16.288
We'll take care of each other,
no matter what.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.249
What about you?

35:21.293 --> 35:25.688
You should be with the one
that you love also, Mom.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.082
Zoe, I...

35:28.126 --> 35:29.170
I've made my decision.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.563
I'm not leaving you.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.173
Mom.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.958
I don't need you.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.398
But Darius does.

35:41.313 --> 35:45.012
And if you still believe
that there is hope...

35:46.187 --> 35:47.797
...go.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.507
:
It's time.

36:07.513 --> 36:10.255
TESS: Darius, you have
an incoming call,

36:10.298 --> 36:14.476
from International Consortium of
Transient Extreme Astrophysics.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.957
Darius? Darius.

36:18.654 --> 36:19.873
Ice T is calling.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.005
Crap.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.923
Tanz. I almost gave up there.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.926
Sorry. Carson,
wh

36:29.970 --> 36:31.232
The damnedest thing.

36:31.276 --> 36:34.235
You were right,
about the neutrino burst.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.672
There were two, actually,
that coincided

36:36.716 --> 36:38.239
with the activity you mentioned.

36:38.283 --> 36:42.243
Only, these bursts happened
inside our solar system.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.071
I've never seen
anything like it.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.290
LIAM: Okay,
so there was

36:45.333 --> 36:47.117
a massive burst of energy...

36:47.161 --> 36:49.468
At exactly the same time
the rail gun slugs

36:49.511 --> 36:51.644
missed the asteroid.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.733
Meaning what?

36:53.776 --> 36:58.172
I was right.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.392
Carson, thank you.
I'll be in touch.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.176
You're sending the...

37:02.220 --> 37:06.180
Liam, can't you see?
Our math was correct.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.138
The asteroid did move.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.967
But the trajectory,
it hasn't changed.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.230
Exactly.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.146
Because it's a hummingbird.

37:16.190 --> 37:19.628
It moved,
and then it moved back.

37:22.457 --> 37:26.853
Oh, that's... that's crazy talk.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.943
Yeah, the only kind
we have left, it seems.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.554
Okay, all right, fine.
Suppose you're right.

37:32.598 --> 37:33.860
What do we do?

37:33.903 --> 37:36.558
So long as Nero is stopping
those nukes,

37:36.602 --> 37:40.170
we're all right, for the moment.

37:40.214 --> 37:44.218
But he's not stopping them.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.046
DARIUS:
What?

37:46.089 --> 37:48.396
In less than an hour, Harris
is gonna push that button.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.052
No! No, w-we can't let him.
No. Come on.

37:52.095 --> 37:55.273
We have to... This is it.
T-This is the moment!

37:55.316 --> 37:57.405
We have to go now!

37:57.449 --> 37:59.668
Who's coming with me?

37:59.712 --> 38:02.410
Me.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.198
I'm going.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.461
What the hell?
Count me in.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.767
Okay.Okay. Alycia, come on.

38:13.813 --> 38:17.295
You know, I'm good here.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.915
Good luck.

38:36.792 --> 38:40.448
Sir, the access codes to
the global nuclear arsenal

38:40.492 --> 38:41.536
have been confirmed.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.103
All silos are on line,

38:43.146 --> 38:45.105
and all submarines
are at launch depth.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.542
Awaiting your order.

38:47.586 --> 38:51.111
Thank you, General.Yes, sir.

38:56.377 --> 38:59.641
Ugh, damn it, I thought
the loading dock was our way in.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.208
Try the south entrance.Everything's been locked down.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.818
This is it. This is the way in.

39:12.959 --> 39:14.308
What are you doing?

39:14.352 --> 39:17.703
What do you think? Hold on.
