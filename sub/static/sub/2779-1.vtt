05:14.170 --> 05:15.070
Okay.

05:28.570 --> 05:34.570
Help me. Help me. Let me go.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.270
Help me.

09:26.370 --> 09:29.670
Well? Did you send it?

09:31.270 --> 09:32.770
Did you send the e-mail?

09:32.970 --> 09:34.170
Pictures.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.370
Yes. I sent them.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.270
I sent them.

09:48.570 --> 09:51.570
We need to keep you high,
Drakie. Understand?

09:51.870 --> 09:54.170
Please nod if you understand.

09:55.170 --> 09:58.370
Now, for you to drink,
I need to take off the gag.

09:58.870 --> 10:00.670
Please ... do not scream.

10:00.770 --> 10:02.670
We do not want to hurt you.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.170
And we certainly don't
wanna kill you.

10:05.270 --> 10:08.570
Now we are absolutely prepared to
do either or both of these things ...

10:08.570 --> 10:12.470
if we need to. Do you understand?
- Yes.

10:14.370 --> 10:17.070
Please don't hurt me.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.470
Please, please let me go.

10:21.570 --> 10:24.870
- I have a daughter and she needs me.
- Shh ...

10:25.470 --> 10:26.370
Please?

10:26.870 --> 10:28.370
We know you don't have a daughter.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.870
We know everything about you.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.670
Now I'm sure it's
a natural response.

10:31.770 --> 10:33.970
You're trying to reason with us ...
you're just ...

10:39.670 --> 10:41.070
Now you listen to me!

10:41.270 --> 10:44.970
The only people that can get you
out of here are him and me.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.070
We are your only friends.

10:47.570 --> 10:50.070
I owe it to you to do as we say.

10:50.670 --> 10:54.170
Now, are you gonna be quiet
and drink from the bottle?

10:55.670 --> 10:56.770
Good.

11:09.970 --> 11:14.470
Whenever you need the bathroom, wait
till we come in and give us this signal.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.070
Try to hold it in,

11:17.170 --> 11:20.470
because we won't be changing
your sheets or your clothes.

11:20.370 --> 11:21.870
Do you understand?

11:22.070 --> 11:23.270
Good.

11:51.570 --> 11:54.170
- We should keep a clear head!
- Need a drink.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.670
Just one.

11:58.170 --> 12:00.270
Make sure it's not your breath in there.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.570
Make sure she can't smell any on you.

12:01.770 --> 12:02.470
Why?

12:02.670 --> 12:04.670
Because we are not a bunch
of fucking amateurs.

12:04.770 --> 12:07.270
Okay. I'll chew some gum after.

12:14.470 --> 12:17.070
You should eat.
Keep your energy up.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.970
I'm not hungry.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.770
I do not care. Eat.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.270
- I said eat!
- I don't want to.

12:29.970 --> 12:30.770
What?

12:30.770 --> 12:31.970
Eat!

12:36.070 --> 12:37.370
Eat it!

12:38.170 --> 12:39.570
I said I'm not hungry.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.670
Fuck! Shit!

12:44.870 --> 12:46.970
That far I told you
I'm not hungry.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.970
You haven't eaten for nine hours,
you've been doing physical work ...

12:49.070 --> 12:51.870
and you're still not hungry?
- No. No.

12:52.370 --> 12:55.270
If you are not hungry, it means
that something is not right.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.470
Maybe you're thinking too much.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.270
About whether we have done
everything right,

13:00.070 --> 13:02.570
or whether we have made a mistake
on the way that will get us caught?

13:02.770 --> 13:04.570
That can get us 20 years in jail.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.770
Or maybe you think about whether
we had to rough up that girl?

13:10.070 --> 13:11.670
Or perhaps even kill her?

13:12.670 --> 13:13.670
Or worse ...

13:14.170 --> 13:18.470
Maybe you are getting senti-fuckin'-mental.
Now this girl isn't just theoretical?!

13:19.370 --> 13:21.570
Now, you've looked into her eyes.

13:21.770 --> 13:23.570
Maybe you're having second thoughts?!

13:24.370 --> 13:27.870
Maybe your conscience is eating
away at your conviction?!

13:29.370 --> 13:31.270
And maybe you are persuading yourself ...

13:31.370 --> 13:35.070
the best thing to do is just go in
there, untie her, and let her go?!

13:35.670 --> 13:37.270
Would you listen to me?

13:37.970 --> 13:40.370
Fuck that!

13:41.970 --> 13:42.870
You understand?

13:43.670 --> 13:44.670
Look at me.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.070
Look at me!

13:46.770 --> 13:48.470
Fuck that!!

13:49.270 --> 13:54.170
We are in this. We are too far
along to get fucking squeamish.

13:54.670 --> 13:58.170
Now, any doubts that you
have, are just bullshit.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.170
They are just major bullshit,
and you know it.

14:01.670 --> 14:04.570
You know it. You know you know it.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.270
So you say it.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.070
Say what?

14:10.470 --> 14:12.470
Fuck that!!

14:15.670 --> 14:17.170
- Fuck that.
- Again.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.970
Fuck that!

14:19.970 --> 14:21.770
Now don't think.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.570
Eat.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.670
We got a long night ahead.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.270
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

14:43.570 --> 14:45.370
We should check on her
before I leave.

14:48.270 --> 14:49.770
Well?

14:50.370 --> 14:52.470
How come I always have to do
the fucking dogwork?

14:52.370 --> 14:53.870
Because that's your role.

14:53.870 --> 14:55.570
Now go and check on her.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.870
Bathroom alert.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.670
Do you need a number one,
or a number two?

15:15.570 --> 15:17.570
Show me with your fingers.

15:35.670 --> 15:36.670
Ready?

16:04.470 --> 16:05.870
Done?

16:34.770 --> 16:36.470
- You're going already?
- Yeah.

16:36.470 --> 16:37.470
It's time.

16:39.670 --> 16:40.770
Be careful.

16:40.870 --> 16:42.670
Remember to dump the phone.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.870
I'm not stupid.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.770
Just reminding.

16:51.770 --> 16:56.070
Don't sleep, check on her,
and don't drink.

16:56.170 --> 16:58.470
Sure. Whatever.

17:00.470 --> 17:04.970
No? Not whatever. You just do it.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.569
You keep your head
in the fucking game.

17:10.970 --> 17:11.970
Do you understand?

17:12.470 --> 17:13.670
Yup.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.770
Fuckin' dick.

19:38.070 --> 19:39.070
What happened?

19:40.370 --> 19:42.170
- Did you make the call?
- Yeah.

19:42.270 --> 19:43.270
I made it.

19:43.370 --> 19:44.870
So how did it go?

19:45.270 --> 19:47.970
- It went fine.
- So he is going to pay?

19:48.370 --> 19:49.870
- He said yes, but?
- But what?

19:49.970 --> 19:51.370
There was a click.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.370
The police were there.
They were listening in.

19:53.370 --> 19:54.070
Police?

19:54.170 --> 19:56.470
Ok. We knew this would
happen eventually.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.770
Yeah, but not so fucking soon.

19:57.870 --> 19:59.970
We planned this. That's why
we dumped the phone.

19:59.870 --> 20:02.470
We planned for this, so calm down.

20:03.070 --> 20:03.970
So what did he say?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.570
He said he wanted to speak
to his daughter,

20:05.770 --> 20:07.170
and make sure she was still alive.

20:07.070 --> 20:07.770
And?

20:07.970 --> 20:10.770
And I said no. He was just playing for
time so they could trace the call.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.770
Trace? Fuck me!

20:12.770 --> 20:14.470
Calm!

20:14.870 --> 20:17.270
- We're okay.
- But he agreed?

20:17.570 --> 20:18.670
He agreed to the money,
to the timing?

20:18.670 --> 20:20.770
Yes. He said he'd get the money
first thing in the morning.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.170
No sequential notes,
no traces, no paybonds.

20:26.470 --> 20:27.670
Good.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.670
I want to be sure.

20:30.370 --> 20:32.670
We need to make sure he goes to
that bank as soon as it opens,

20:32.670 --> 20:36.270
and gets that money as fast
as he fucking can.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.870
We need you to do something.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.670
He is going to untie you.
When he does,

20:47.770 --> 20:52.570
you're gonna to sit on the edge of
the bed, and stay very very still.

20:52.570 --> 20:53.670
Understand?

21:25.170 --> 21:28.770
You are going to look into this
camera, and speak to your father.

21:29.270 --> 21:31.470
Tell him, that he must pay the money.

21:31.570 --> 21:34.970
He must do exactly as we ask,
or we will kill you.

21:35.070 --> 21:38.470
You tell him that you have no
doubts that we will kill you.

21:38.670 --> 21:39.970
Understand?

21:40.470 --> 21:41.670
Yes.

21:41.670 --> 21:42.970
Good.

21:44.570 --> 21:45.670
Take: 1.

21:49.970 --> 21:50.870
Daddy ...

21:52.570 --> 21:54.470
I'm okay.

21:55.470 --> 21:56.870
They just took me ...

21:58.970 --> 22:01.370
I was leaving the house,
and they just took me.

22:03.370 --> 22:05.070
I do not know where I am.

22:05.970 --> 22:06.870
Stop!

22:08.370 --> 22:11.770
I don't want a narrative. I just
want you to look into the camera ...

22:11.770 --> 22:15.170
and tell him that unless he pays
the money, we will kill you.

22:15.270 --> 22:18.470
Any deviation from our
instructions, we will kill you.

22:18.370 --> 22:22.370
Any piss, we will kill you!

22:23.270 --> 22:24.270
Understand?

22:25.670 --> 22:26.670
Yes.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.570
No. She is not scared enough.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.370
Give her some motivation.

22:40.870 --> 22:41.970
That's better.

22:42.370 --> 22:46.170
Now, get yourself together
and try again.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.670
Daddy ...

23:02.070 --> 23:03.670
I love you.

23:03.870 --> 23:05.270
Please ...

23:06.370 --> 23:07.270
Pay.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.470
Pay them the money.

23:09.770 --> 23:13.170
Just do exactly as they say,
or they will kill me.

23:13.270 --> 23:16.170
Daddy, they will kill me
if you don't.

23:17.470 --> 23:19.870
Please, Daddy.

23:20.170 --> 23:22.970
Just do exactly as they say, please.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.970
Just pay them the money.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.570
I want to come home.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.570
Just give them the money, please.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.570
Thank you.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.670
No, no, please. I won't cry.

23:51.570 --> 23:53.570
My arms hurt.

23:54.070 --> 23:55.570
Uncuff her.

24:02.370 --> 24:03.970
Move them around a bit.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.670
Go on.

24:13.270 --> 24:14.270
Better?

24:15.570 --> 24:16.870
A little.

24:17.670 --> 24:18.570
Tie her up.

24:25.770 --> 24:27.170
Please Daddy.

24:28.270 --> 24:31.370
They just pay them the money.
I want to come home.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.570
Just give them the money, please.

24:39.070 --> 24:40.470
This is good.

24:42.970 --> 24:45.270
This'll work.

24:45.170 --> 24:47.870
- She did well.
- She did.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.870
She was a good choice.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.770
She was a good find, then.

24:59.170 --> 25:00.470
Don't fall asleep.

25:02.670 --> 25:04.370
These will keep you awake.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.570
Keep an eye on her.

25:06.870 --> 25:08.270
She's worth a lot of money to us.

25:09.170 --> 25:09.970
I know.

25:11.370 --> 25:12.570
Take care.

26:24.970 --> 26:26.070
No.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.970
No.

26:30.170 --> 26:31.870
Get this off.

26:45.370 --> 26:46.570
I can't.

26:50.370 --> 26:53.770
I can't go with you watching me.

26:54.670 --> 26:58.570
Could you just leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

26:58.570 --> 27:01.370
I can't shit with you
staring at me, just ...

27:01.870 --> 27:02.670
Please.

27:02.770 --> 27:06.470
I can't do it with you
standing there and looking at me.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.370
Let me go! Let me go!

27:52.470 --> 27:54.370
Give me the fucking keys
and cut the machine!

27:57.470 --> 28:00.070
I'll kill you when I get the keys
from you ... bloody ...

28:00.070 --> 28:01.270
It's Danny. It's Danny.

28:01.470 --> 28:03.970
It's me, Danny.

28:04.370 --> 28:05.270
What?

28:05.270 --> 28:06.570
It's me, Alice.

28:08.070 --> 28:09.670
- It's me.
- Danny.

28:11.370 --> 28:13.370
- What the fuck are you doing.
- Put the gun down.

28:13.470 --> 28:15.470
- The gun Alice, the gun.
- Was it you? Was it you?

28:15.870 --> 28:18.370
- There is a plan.
- A plan? Fuck!

28:18.770 --> 28:21.470
- Danny ¦- Just put the fucking gun
down before you kill me, Alice.

28:21.370 --> 28:25.670
Just get me the fuck out of here.
Unlock me right fucking now.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.970
Hold on, alright, okay.
Just listen to me first.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.870
- We're getting some money
from your dad. ¦- What?

28:29.870 --> 28:30.670
A lot of money.

28:30.670 --> 28:32.070
You always sayin' how much
you hate your dad.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.570
What the fuck are you talking about?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.870
You hate him Alice, he cut you off.

28:35.970 --> 28:38.870
He's got all that fucking money,
and he's never gonna get ...

28:39.370 --> 28:41.570
You've always talked about a way
of getting his money off him.

28:41.570 --> 28:42.970
This is it, Alice.

28:43.070 --> 28:44.570
This is how.

28:44.770 --> 28:46.470
This is how we can get his money.

28:46.470 --> 28:49.070
But, you've fucking kidnapped me.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.170
Yes. I kidnapped you for us.

28:51.170 --> 28:53.870
- The money is for us. It's all for us.
- What?

28:54.170 --> 28:56.270
Look, this is a good thing, Alice.

28:56.370 --> 28:57.670
Good?

28:58.070 --> 29:00.270
You've fucking kidnapped me.

29:00.570 --> 29:05.170
You've fucking stripped me naked, you
made me piss in a fucking bottle ...

29:05.070 --> 29:06.170
in front of ... Who?

29:06.170 --> 29:08.670
Who the fuck is the other man?
Do I know him too?

29:08.770 --> 29:10.770
No no. It's Victor. It's Vic.

29:10.770 --> 29:12.670
He's no one. He's no one.

29:13.170 --> 29:15.170
I met him on the other side of ...

29:15.270 --> 29:15.970
About what?

29:16.070 --> 29:16.970
About us.

29:17.770 --> 29:20.770
He thinks you're just a random rich
girl. He doesn't know, you betcha.

29:20.770 --> 29:23.470
He thinks all this is his plan.

29:24.970 --> 29:27.770
He doesn't suspect that we're
gonna take all the money.

29:27.870 --> 29:30.370
All of it, me and you.

29:30.470 --> 29:34.170
You've fucking kidnapped me, so
I can get some of my dad's money.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.770
Uh? Yeah.

29:37.170 --> 29:40.470
Then why the fuck
didn't you ask me first?

29:40.470 --> 29:43.770
I thought I was gonna fucking die,
here. I was fucking terrified.

29:43.670 --> 29:44.970
I know, I know. I am sorry, right.

29:45.170 --> 29:48.970
But it had to look real.
Feel real? for Vic.

29:48.870 --> 29:49.970
For you.

29:50.070 --> 29:51.470
Look real?

29:52.770 --> 29:54.870
Can't fucking do that
to somebody, Danny.

29:54.970 --> 29:57.370
You can't make them think
they're gonna fucking die.

29:57.370 --> 29:58.970
You can't fake it, Alice,

29:59.170 --> 30:00.370
not properly.

30:00.370 --> 30:03.470
He would have seen if you're
pretending. He would have known.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.670
You told me you loved me.

30:07.670 --> 30:11.170
You told me that you loved me.

30:11.270 --> 30:12.670
I do, baby.

30:13.070 --> 30:17.570
That's why? That's why I did this,
because I love you.

30:17.670 --> 30:19.470
I was gonna tell the
truth out? I was?

30:19.570 --> 30:20.870
What would you have said?

30:20.870 --> 30:23.670
Sorry I fucking kidnapped you. Sorry,
I've totally fucking humiliated you.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.370
But we will be rich, Alice.

30:25.570 --> 30:27.270
Rich!

30:27.570 --> 30:28.970
How much?

30:28.970 --> 30:30.770
How much am I worth?

30:30.770 --> 30:32.170
Two million.

30:32.870 --> 30:36.970
And he is gonna pay ...
2 million, cash.

30:37.070 --> 30:38.370
Untraceable.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.270
All you have to do
is lie in that bed.

30:41.470 --> 30:42.870
Tied down ...

30:43.270 --> 30:45.970
humiliated, abused.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.570
It will only be for
another day or so.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.370
Not too much to ask for 2 million?

30:49.670 --> 30:51.670
For a whole new life.

30:52.570 --> 30:53.670
Alice ...

30:54.270 --> 30:57.270
I love you, truly.

30:59.670 --> 31:01.470
So, can I have my gun back?

31:03.970 --> 31:05.870
Alice, please.

31:06.370 --> 31:07.870
Just do this.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.570
Fuck!

31:12.470 --> 31:16.070
It's him. He's back. He's back.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.570
You have to give me the gun.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.970
If I do not answer the door,
he'll kick it in.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.370
If he comes in here
and sees us like this ...

31:23.370 --> 31:25.170
he'll go fucking crazy.

31:25.270 --> 31:27.170
He'll fucking kill us both.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.370
You won't escape, Alice.

31:30.570 --> 31:31.570
He'll kill ye.

31:31.670 --> 31:33.170
I'm not joking.

31:34.270 --> 31:35.470
Don't be stupid.

31:35.570 --> 31:36.870
Give me the gun.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.070
Please.

31:41.570 --> 31:43.370
Let him fucking hurt me.

31:43.470 --> 31:44.670
I won't.

31:57.670 --> 31:59.470
Danny.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.770
Promise me.

32:01.770 --> 32:03.170
I promise.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.270
Where the fuck were you?

32:27.370 --> 32:29.170
She's taking a shit.
I had to keep the gun on her.

32:29.170 --> 32:30.370
And you did it by yourself?

32:30.370 --> 32:31.670
It's no problem.
I just watched her.

32:31.670 --> 32:33.670
Look at me! Look at me!

32:33.770 --> 32:34.870
Is she ok?

32:34.870 --> 32:35.770
Yeah.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.470
Go look if you like.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.770
Speak to her dad?
Saw the video?

32:57.870 --> 33:00.670
I think he now understands
the gravity of the situation.

33:00.670 --> 33:01.770
So when is the exchange?

33:02.370 --> 33:03.370
Tomorrow.

33:03.370 --> 33:04.970
- You made the arrangement?
- No.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.870
He don't have time to prepare.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.470
As soon as he gets the money,
then we start it moving.

33:09.470 --> 33:11.370
- So it's all ok?
- Yeah.

33:11.370 --> 33:14.070
- This is gonna work?
- Of course it is.

33:18.470 --> 33:20.670
You should get some sleep.
We have a busy day tomorrow.

33:20.770 --> 33:21.870
You don't want to?

33:21.770 --> 33:24.670
No. There is too much adrenaline
running through me.

33:24.770 --> 33:25.770
You sleep first.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.070
You need me to check on her?

33:27.170 --> 33:29.070
I think I can handle it for a while.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.470
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

33:41.970 --> 33:42.970
Use this!

33:44.970 --> 33:46.270
Thanks.

33:51.870 --> 33:53.270
Sleep tight.

34:24.370 --> 34:25.570
Fuck!

34:25.870 --> 34:27.870
What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me up?

34:27.870 --> 34:30.170
I didn't need to fucking
fall asleep, did I?

34:30.670 --> 34:31.670
Shit! The girl.

34:34.870 --> 34:35.969
Wake up!

35:09.170 --> 35:11.070
Wake up, Ms. Creed.

35:12.270 --> 35:13.970
It's breakfast time.

35:34.170 --> 35:35.470
It's minestrone.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.870
It's hot.

35:45.070 --> 35:46.070
Oops.

35:47.470 --> 35:48.670
Got it.

36:01.370 --> 36:05.070
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

36:27.670 --> 36:28.970
What are you doing?

36:29.270 --> 36:31.570
Go back to the other side
and keep her in the eye.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.170
Finished.

37:03.870 --> 37:04.970
Good.

37:05.470 --> 37:06.470
Open up!

37:17.370 --> 37:18.870
Give it to me.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.870
Give me the spoon.

37:49.370 --> 37:51.770
- What's gone into you?
- Nothing.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.970
I'm fine.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.170
You don't look fine.

37:56.870 --> 37:58.470
Don't start thinking.

37:59.470 --> 38:01.070
I need you focused.

38:01.070 --> 38:01.970
I am.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.570
Are you sure?

38:06.670 --> 38:08.170
Absolutely.

38:08.470 --> 38:10.970
Good. Cause I need you.

38:12.270 --> 38:14.170
I can't do this without you.

38:15.970 --> 38:17.270
You got me.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.470
Good boy.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.170
Where you going?

38:28.470 --> 38:32.470
Take a piss. Is that alright?

39:21.970 --> 39:23.670
You okay in there?

39:28.070 --> 39:29.270
Danny, what's wrong?

39:29.270 --> 39:30.870
Everything is fine.

39:33.170 --> 39:33.770
Are you sure?

39:33.770 --> 39:36.070
But? I'll just be a second.

39:36.770 --> 39:38.270
Danny, are you okay in there?

39:40.670 --> 39:41.570
Danny?

39:41.570 --> 39:42.470
Danny?

39:43.670 --> 39:44.670
Danny!

39:45.270 --> 39:46.770
What the fuck
are you doing in there?

39:46.770 --> 39:47.670
Nothing.

39:47.870 --> 39:51.170
Danny, open this door right now,
or I'll kick it in.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.170
Open this fucking door!

39:53.370 --> 39:55.370
Open this fucking door, now!

39:55.370 --> 39:57.370
Right, I'm coming in!

39:59.670 --> 40:03.370
- Jesus fuck ... what the fuck ...?
- Why the fuck don't you open the door?

40:03.570 --> 40:05.470
I do not know what you?

40:06.770 --> 40:07.970
I was worried.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.670
I said I would be out in a second.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.570
Something wouldn't go down.

40:15.170 --> 40:17.270
You said you just needed to piss.

40:17.270 --> 40:18.770
Thought I did.

40:22.970 --> 40:24.370
It's gone now.

40:25.270 --> 40:26.770
Sometimes a jam.

40:32.470 --> 40:33.370
What?

40:33.670 --> 40:35.670
Doesn't smell of any stink of you.

40:36.170 --> 40:38.770
My shit don't stink.
What can I say?

40:41.770 --> 40:44.370
Jus' wash your hands
and stop fucking about!

40:55.670 --> 40:56.970
It's the adrenaline.

40:57.070 --> 40:58.670
Suddenly you shit.

40:59.670 --> 41:01.470
Bad taste in your mouth.

41:02.170 --> 41:03.670
Because of the  adrenaline.

41:03.970 --> 41:05.770
Happened to me when I made
the first call.

41:09.170 --> 41:10.770
Just relax, Danny.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.970
We need air.

41:16.270 --> 41:17.970
Not long till the bank opens.

41:18.470 --> 41:21.170
And after that? Showtime.

41:21.670 --> 41:23.570
We're gonna be rich. Me and you.

41:25.670 --> 41:27.670
We're gonna be millionaires.

41:29.670 --> 41:30.870
We're nearly there, Dan.

41:31.770 --> 41:33.770
We're nearly there.

41:34.170 --> 41:35.470
You're all up?

41:35.670 --> 41:37.170
I'm good.

41:39.670 --> 41:44.270
- Are you sure?
- Why is that?

41:46.170 --> 41:48.070
Two days ...

41:48.870 --> 41:51.370
we're gonna be on the other side
of the world.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.170
Just me and you.

41:54.870 --> 41:57.070
Just me and you.

41:58.070 --> 42:01.270
Away from this shit.
Away from the past.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.470
And we're startin' new lives,

42:04.670 --> 42:06.270
and new people,

42:08.970 --> 42:11.170
being happy.

42:12.670 --> 42:16.670
But the first two weeks,
we'll hardly get out a bit.

42:18.570 --> 42:22.670
We'll just order room service,
and fuck each other senseless.

42:22.970 --> 42:24.870
That sounds perfect.

42:25.270 --> 42:26.970
Destiny.

42:59.870 --> 43:02.070
Gotta go.

43:02.770 --> 43:04.270
I see you soon.

43:06.070 --> 43:07.670
You take care.

43:07.970 --> 43:09.170
You too.

43:17.370 --> 43:18.670
I love you.

43:20.570 --> 43:22.570
I love you too, baby.

44:02.170 --> 44:03.670
- Are you alright?
- Where is he?

44:04.170 --> 44:05.770
It's gonna happen soon.

44:05.770 --> 44:07.970
That fucking bullet case.
I thought he'd seen it.

44:07.970 --> 44:10.670
It's Ok. Got rid of it.

44:10.770 --> 44:11.970
How long until he comes back?

44:12.070 --> 44:13.270
An hour I guess.

44:13.670 --> 44:15.270
Maybe less.

44:15.670 --> 44:16.970
Untie me.

44:18.670 --> 44:20.670
Come on, Danny. Untie me.

44:21.170 --> 44:22.470
He's gone.

44:42.370 --> 44:44.170
Danny?

44:44.270 --> 44:45.570
The other one?

44:46.370 --> 44:48.070
Danny? What's wrong?

44:48.870 --> 44:50.770
Come on, Danny. Unlock it.

44:50.870 --> 44:52.570
- Do you fucking trust me?
- Of course, but ...

44:52.570 --> 44:55.770
But what? I let you gag me,
tie me back up, that?

44:55.970 --> 44:58.470
I fucking trusted you,
so you can fucking trust me.

44:58.570 --> 44:59.570
I do trust you too.

44:59.670 --> 45:00.770
But what?

45:01.070 --> 45:03.070
- You think I'm gonna run?
- No, I do not.

45:03.170 --> 45:04.670
Look, place the end right.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.970
As soon he comes back,
we're taking it to the exchange ...

45:07.970 --> 45:09.370
Are we gonna get the money?

45:09.370 --> 45:10.270
Yeah.

45:10.470 --> 45:12.070
Why would I run?

45:17.370 --> 45:18.570
I am sorry.

45:20.870 --> 45:22.670
I'm just jumpy.

45:28.870 --> 45:30.770
This is fucking stressful.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.670
You think?

45:42.070 --> 45:43.070
Thanks.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.470
Those things
are very fucking painful.

45:50.570 --> 45:54.470
- Pins and needles in my
fingers and toes. ¦- Yeah

46:00.570 --> 46:03.770
- Better?
- Ok.

46:06.570 --> 46:09.170
Danny, what if your friend ...

46:09.870 --> 46:11.970
think ... what if he?

46:12.170 --> 46:15.070
- What if he is onto us? What if
he suspects us? ¦- He doesn't.

46:14.970 --> 46:18.270
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- Believe me, he hasn't got a clue.

46:18.570 --> 46:20.170
How did you do it?

46:20.270 --> 46:23.970
- What? ¦- How did you get him
to agree to pick me for this?

46:23.970 --> 46:25.970
You fit his criteria.

46:26.270 --> 46:31.570
Attractive? Female?
In her 20s, only child.

46:32.670 --> 46:35.670
- Slim enough to cat easy.
- Jesus.

46:35.670 --> 46:37.870
Vic's been planning this forever.

46:37.970 --> 46:40.270
Old-timer in prison talked about it.

46:40.570 --> 46:42.870
I never really thought
he would do it, but?

46:43.770 --> 46:46.070
When he got out, he contacted me.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.570
He set about looking for a target.

46:49.770 --> 46:53.670
Of course, then afterward ...

46:53.770 --> 46:55.470
So he tested me?

46:56.970 --> 46:58.970
But you did not tell him that we
knew each other from before?

46:59.070 --> 47:00.070
Of course not.

47:01.970 --> 47:04.070
Dad's on the rich list.

47:04.270 --> 47:07.070
He said just write your name
in that newspaper article though.

47:07.270 --> 47:09.070
I even cut it out and gave it to Vic.

47:10.170 --> 47:11.370
He went for you right away.

47:11.470 --> 47:14.570
He said you were "Perfect".

47:16.970 --> 47:19.470
- Where is he now?
- Arranging the exchange.

47:19.470 --> 47:20.270
At the ...?

47:20.570 --> 47:23.270
Near the river? Driving nearby.

47:23.570 --> 47:25.570
So he can escape,
and dad can find you.

47:25.670 --> 47:27.070
And Vic gets the money.

47:27.170 --> 47:29.570
- By himself?
- I stay with you.

47:29.570 --> 47:31.470
But he could just steal it
and disappear.

47:31.470 --> 47:32.270
Ah no, he wouldn't.

47:32.270 --> 47:33.270
How can you be sure?

47:33.370 --> 47:34.970
I just am.

47:35.270 --> 47:36.170
Trust me.

47:36.570 --> 47:38.270
It's not even considered.

47:39.470 --> 47:41.570
And when he's getting the money,
I'll be setting you free.

47:42.770 --> 47:45.170
And once he has money,
I'm going to take it from him,

47:46.870 --> 47:48.170
and we meet up,

47:49.170 --> 47:50.570
get the fuck out of here.

47:50.670 --> 47:52.170
How you take the money?

47:52.970 --> 47:54.770
He trusts me.

47:55.370 --> 47:56.370
It will be easy.

47:56.970 --> 47:59.770
- He trusts you?
- Completely.

48:04.870 --> 48:06.570
- Danny?
- What?

48:08.670 --> 48:09.870
I'm scared.

48:09.870 --> 48:11.570
- Don't let me?
- I am sorry.

48:13.270 --> 48:14.270
It's ok.

48:15.270 --> 48:17.170
I won't let anything
happen to you.

48:18.170 --> 48:19.070
Trust me.

48:20.370 --> 48:21.870
Everything's going to be fine.

48:28.870 --> 48:32.270
- Danny?
- What?

48:41.070 --> 48:43.170
I love you so much.

48:44.570 --> 48:46.770
I love you too, baby.

50:08.770 --> 50:10.570
Alice, this isn't fucking funny.

50:10.570 --> 50:11.570
I'm warning you.

50:11.570 --> 50:13.770
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

50:13.870 --> 50:14.970
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

50:15.070 --> 50:17.070
- Alice, you can't do this.
- Fuck you!

50:17.270 --> 50:18.370
I was so close.

50:18.370 --> 50:21.070
- Close what?
- You fucking kidnapped me, you cunt.

50:21.070 --> 50:22.970
You do not expect me to sit
around and just let it happen?

50:23.070 --> 50:25.370
- But we had a plan.
- No, you had a plan.

50:25.470 --> 50:27.170
This is my plan.

50:27.870 --> 50:29.970
Alice, Alice come back!

50:42.870 --> 50:45.070
Police? Quick. I need the police.

50:45.170 --> 50:47.070
Why don't you come and get me?
I have been kidnapped.

50:47.070 --> 50:49.670
I havn't got much time.
I don't know where I am.

50:49.770 --> 50:52.270
No, I've been locked here.
I can't get out.

50:55.870 --> 50:57.670
No. I don't recognize anything.

50:57.770 --> 50:58.870
I'm up high.

51:00.470 --> 51:02.070
Can't you trace the call?

51:02.170 --> 51:04.370
Yeah. Ah, thank God.

51:04.370 --> 51:05.870
How long will that take?

51:06.070 --> 51:07.370
How long?

51:07.470 --> 51:09.570
No, no-no-no.
You have to come get me now.

51:09.670 --> 51:11.670
If the other guy's coming back,
he'll kill me.

51:11.670 --> 51:13.670
He's gonna come back.
He's gonna fucking kill me.

51:13.670 --> 51:15.770
You're have to come right now,
right now, right fucking now!

51:15.770 --> 51:18.770
Calm down?
He's gonna fucking kill me.

51:25.270 --> 51:26.870
Wait a second?

51:27.670 --> 51:28.970
I think, I can get the keys.

51:52.170 --> 51:53.170
I love you.

51:53.370 --> 51:54.970
I fucking love you.

51:54.970 --> 51:56.670
And you love me, I know you do.

51:56.670 --> 51:58.470
- I know you do.
- Where are the keys?

51:58.570 --> 52:01.070
Alice, you can't do this.

52:01.670 --> 52:02.770
I love you.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.470
No, Danny.

52:04.670 --> 52:09.870
When you love someone, you do
everything you can to care for them.

52:11.370 --> 52:14.870
What you don't do, is kidnap them.

52:15.070 --> 52:16.570
Understand?

52:16.970 --> 52:19.070
You don't fucking jump them
in the streets,

52:19.170 --> 52:21.170
and put them in the back of a van.

52:21.370 --> 52:23.970
You don't put a fucking knife
to their throats.

52:24.670 --> 52:25.970
The keys!

52:29.970 --> 52:31.870
I swear it to God, Danny.

52:32.470 --> 52:34.470
You need to tell me
where the keys are.

52:35.670 --> 52:38.370
In my pocket, right-hand pocket.

52:44.270 --> 52:45.970
Go back on the bed!

52:47.570 --> 52:49.670
Get back on the fucking bed!

52:53.370 --> 52:55.370
Don't fucking move!

53:36.870 --> 53:38.270
The safety was on.

53:40.370 --> 53:41.870
Not anymore.

53:42.270 --> 53:43.570
The keys?

53:43.770 --> 53:46.070
Throw me the fucking keys!

54:20.870 --> 54:24.170
Oh, c'mon ... fuck ... c'mon

54:29.470 --> 54:31.070
I'm fucked.

54:33.170 --> 54:34.270
Fuck!

54:42.270 --> 54:44.970
Why didn't you just listen to me?

54:45.770 --> 54:48.470
All would have been alright
if you just listened to me.

56:43.770 --> 56:44.970
Is everything okay?

56:46.370 --> 56:47.970
- Top-notch.
- She still in there?

56:47.970 --> 56:50.270
- Where else would she be?
- Yeah ...

56:51.070 --> 56:52.370
Yes of course. It's just?

56:55.670 --> 56:57.270
It's time? It's on.

56:57.370 --> 56:58.370
- He's got the money?
- Yeah.

56:58.470 --> 57:00.270
He's just waiting at the location.

57:00.270 --> 57:02.770
This is really quite a fucking work.

57:03.970 --> 57:06.870
Right. We have to move her outta
there and put her in the warehouse.

57:06.770 --> 57:08.170
- When do we leave?
- Now!

57:08.270 --> 57:09.670
We move now.

57:18.770 --> 57:19.870
This is it.

57:21.070 --> 57:23.470
We're gonna have to move you now.
Understand?

57:23.970 --> 57:26.170
Nod if you understand.

57:29.370 --> 57:32.170
Hey! Wake up!

57:34.570 --> 57:35.270
She's air-cold.

57:35.470 --> 57:37.070
What the fuck did you do?

57:37.070 --> 57:38.270
Nothing. I thought she was sleeping.

57:38.470 --> 57:40.070
Fuck! Must be the gag that's
complicated her throat.

57:40.070 --> 57:41.370
Is she alright?

57:42.770 --> 57:43.670
Wait here.

57:58.270 --> 57:59.370
Thank God.

57:59.470 --> 58:01.070
I thought we had killed her.

58:02.270 --> 58:04.070
Wake up, Miss Creed.

58:04.570 --> 58:05.470
Wake up.

58:05.470 --> 58:06.470
Say something.

58:06.670 --> 58:09.070
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Are you okay? Say something.

58:09.270 --> 58:10.670
You need to calm down.

58:10.670 --> 58:12.070
She's alright.

58:12.770 --> 58:14.070
Everything is fine.

58:16.070 --> 58:17.670
She's got a minute to breathe.

58:18.970 --> 58:22.270
Come on. Let's just have
a minute together,

58:22.370 --> 58:23.570
to re-focus.

58:26.870 --> 58:27.870
Come on.

58:28.370 --> 58:29.370
Look at me.

58:29.970 --> 58:31.670
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

58:33.170 --> 58:34.570
Shit. Fuck.

58:38.470 --> 58:40.270
Will you do something for me?

58:41.570 --> 58:42.470
What?

58:43.770 --> 58:45.770
Tell me what to do.

58:46.470 --> 58:48.570
I need you to stop worrying.

58:48.670 --> 58:49.870
And just be back.

58:50.270 --> 58:53.470
Makes confident.
That pushes me on ... to be mean.

58:53.570 --> 58:54.270
Me?

58:54.270 --> 58:56.670
Meanest fuck.

58:57.970 --> 58:59.370
That's the back I want.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.370
That's the guy they want.

59:02.170 --> 59:03.570
So c'mon,

59:03.670 --> 59:05.070
push me right.

59:05.470 --> 59:06.970
Tell me what to do.

59:09.670 --> 59:11.870
Stand the fuck up.

59:17.570 --> 59:19.470
Go, put on your coat.

59:28.470 --> 59:30.470
I can't put the van into position.

59:31.970 --> 59:33.370
The van?

59:34.070 --> 59:35.870
- Now?
- Yes, fucking now!

59:35.970 --> 59:38.170
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna pack the bag.

59:38.170 --> 59:40.570
- But don't unpack?
- Just fucking do it!

59:40.570 --> 59:41.970
Now!

59:42.670 --> 59:43.770
Go on!

59:56.270 --> 59:57.270
No? Please.

59:57.170 --> 59:59.570
No, wait. Please wait.
Wait a second.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.770
What the fuck?

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.070
How did you get this?

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.670
How the fuck did you get this?

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.270
Quietly.

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.670
Tell me how you got it.

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:14.070
Tell me!

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:15.270
I don't know.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.870
How did you fucking get it?

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:17.970
I don't know.

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.870
Please let? I don't want
to cause any trouble.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:21.770
I just wanna do exactly as you say.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.870
999.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:24.670
Police.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.570
Did you call the police?

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.970
- The fucking police ... did you call
the police? ¦- I don't know, I just?

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.470
Tell me the truth.

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:34.970
How could I? I've been up
tied up since I got here.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.570
Then how did you
get that fucking phone?

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.070
- Don't know.
- Tell me the truth.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.070
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:40.770
I don't know it. Don't know.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.970
Please don't.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:44.870
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.670
Tell me! Tell me!
Fucking tell me!

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:49.770
Please stop it! No!

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.670
Danny, help me. Danny.
Danny!

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:55.670
Danny?!

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.070
How do you know that name.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.670
Help me, please, Danny.

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.570
How did you know his name.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.470
Do you know him?

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.070
No, I ...

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.670
He just told me his name.

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:09.770
- He gave you the phone.
- No.

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:11.370
You phoned?

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.070
And you throw it down?

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.170
What else is there?

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:21.070
- I don't know. Please. Please ...
- Fuck!

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:23.970
Fuck!

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.170
Please, please just take me home.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.570
Shut up!

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.970
- What happened here?
- Nothing.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.570
Just take me home, please.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:55.470
Please.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.570
- This is a bullet.
- I don't know.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:58.470
I don't know.

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:00.070
Who fired the gun?

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:03.870
Who fired the gun?!

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.270
Please just take me home.
I don't ... I've done nothing!

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.670
You tell me, or I swear to God ...

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:13.070
you'll never see your family again.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.970
Tell me!

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.870
I fired.

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:26.570
I needed the toilet.

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:28.870
He turned his back,

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:31.370
I hit him, and took his gun.

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.270
Well, if you got the gun,

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:35.970
then why you still here?

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:40.070
Because? Because he's
gonna fuck you.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.370
He's gonna take the money.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:43.770
The whole two million.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.870
I am still here because he
made a deal with me.

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.070
He said if I went along
with the Plan ...

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.070
he would ...

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:53.170
He would give you
some of the money.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:57.270
It all went so quickly, and?

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.970
you were coming back.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:00.770
I couldn't get away, so?

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.370
I agreed.

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:06.170
I am sorry.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:12.670
But now you know.

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:13.870
You can?

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:16.770
You can go along with the plan.

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:19.670
You can just pick up the money ...

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.970
and you can disappear.

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:24.870
He can fuck him instead, right?

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.970
You can take the money, all of it.

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.270
Fuck him, right?

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.770
You can just take me back
to my father.

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:40.470
You can take me back to my family.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:43.270
All I want is to go back to my home.

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.470
Please, please, please ...

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.470
What is my name?

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.770
What?

01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.770
I? I don't know.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.870
I don't know your name.

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.270
Yes, you do.

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:05.570
He told you.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.170
Tell me now, please.

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.970
He didn't tell me your name.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:16.670
Please.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:17.970
You're lying.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.670
Please. I just want to go home.

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.370
- I can see you're lying ...
- I just wanna to go home. I?

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:14.070
What's wrong?

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.270
Why would anything be wrong?

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:19.970
You just seem a bit?

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.270
A bit what?

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:23.470
Shall we go, get her up?

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:25.870
I already did it.

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:27.570
I was just in there.

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:28.970
You were?

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.570
Is she alright?

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:47.770
Vic, is she alright?

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:04.970
I'm going for a piss.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:09.270
Wait here.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.370
Danny, tell me something?

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.570
Why did you choose her?

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:45.770
I didn't choose her.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:47.370
You choose her?

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.870
Yes, but you suggested her.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.270
Why?

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.670
You know why?

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.970
I read about her in the newspaper.

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.870
What's this all about, Vic?

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:00.470
Jus'? Something doesn't
feel quite right.

01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:01.670
What d'you mean?

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.170
Just now ...

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:05.770
she was acting funny.

01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:07.970
Why? What did she say?

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:09.570
Say?

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.670
Why would you think
she'd say anything?

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:16.970
I don't? Ah?

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.670
- You said she was acting funny.
- Yeah.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.870
I didn't say she said anything.

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:24.570
What could she say?

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:27.970
What do you think she would say?

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:31.670
Come here.

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.570
I said, come here!

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:58.270
- Tell me you love me.
- What?

01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.070
Tell me ...

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:02.070
you love me.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:05.470
I love you, babe.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.370
Truly.

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.870
Let's get this thing done!

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:08.970
Wait here.

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:08.870
What happened to her face?

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:09.870
I told you.

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:11.370
She was acting funny.

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:13.370
So I had to give her a slap.

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:23.070
Bryce, give me your set-keys.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:24.270
You got your own set,
why do you want mine?

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:27.070
Because you don't need
them anymore, do you?

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:29.570
Why? Is there a problem?

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:30.470
No problem.

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.570
Then give them to me.

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.870
Bryce, let's go.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.370
To where?

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:50.870
Let's go and get the money.

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:52.270
Both of us?

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:53.670
The plan was I would stay here.

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:55.470
- Plan has changed.
- Changed?

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.070
I need you to meet.

01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:58.270
In case there's any surprises.

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:00.870
- Like what? ¦- If I knew that, they
won't be surprises, would they?

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:02.770
But what if something happens?

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:03.870
What if we don't make it back?

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:05.970
- We'll make it.
- But if we??

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:08.670
If we don't, she'll be stuck here.

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.970
- She'll die.
- So?

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:12.270
If we don't make it,

01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:14.470
why do you care
if she don't make it?

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:19.570
I don't care.

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:21.370
Good.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.470
Now, let's get the fuck
out of here!

01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:13.170
- You think it's there?
- Yeah.

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:14.970
It's there.

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:16.870
Go out and get it!

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:17.970
Me?

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.970
Danny,

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:20.970
just go and get the fucking money!

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:24.770
Now!

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:29.070
There's no fucking money.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.170
They fucked us over.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.770
- We're fucked up.
- No, they didn't fuck up.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:39.070
The money is not here because
I didn't say it was at this location.

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:42.770
The hole?

01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:48.270
- This hole is for the money.
- No.

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:52.370
Now, this hole is for you, Danny.

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:54.470
I didn't fuck up.

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:55.870
You did.

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.170
Please.

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:01.870
Don't do this.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.870
What did you tell her about me?

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:11.470
Nothing.

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.170
You told her my name.

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:18.370
Only your first name.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.870
- Only that we met in prison, that it,
that's all. ¦- You fucking dealed.

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.570
You killed her, Danny.

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:28.370
You've not only killed yourself,

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.870
but you've killed her too.

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.470
You do not have to do this.

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:36.170
We can just finish this,

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:37.970
like we planned.

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:40.970
We'll go away.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.370
We'll be happy.

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:45.870
I'll do everything you want me to.

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:48.370
It'll just be you.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.070
That's what we wanted.

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:53.470
I love you.

01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:55.970
Close your eyes.

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:56.570
Danny,

01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:58.170
close your eyes.

01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:00.570
Do you remember when we met?

01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:02.970
Can you remember?

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:06.470
We slept in the cell.

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:08.770
I was scared.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:11.870
I was so fucking scared.

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:14.070
You protected me.

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.770
You ... helped me.

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:19.770
I will never forget that.

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:22.570
I will never ...

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:11.070
It's almost over.

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:15.170
Please be still Miss Creed.

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:18.670
It'll all be over very quickly.

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:20.870
You will feel no pain.

01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:33.270
Danny.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:37.270
Danny, you're bleeding.

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:40.270
I can get you to a hospital.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:42.870
I'll get you fixed up.

01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.470
You'll die, Danny.

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:53.970
Listen!

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.070
You'll die.

01:20:58.170 --> 01:20:59.770
Let me help you.

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:00.970
Danny?

01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:04.670
Let me protect you.

01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:08.070
- Stand against the fucking wall!
- Ok.

01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:10.470
Whatever you want.

01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:12.270
Danny!

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:25.370
Ah, Danny ...

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.070
Get me off here.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.670
Keys?

01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:34.370
Toss the keys.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.670
Danny,

01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:37.470
don't do this, please.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.170
Give me the fucking keys!

01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:47.370
Danny, you love me.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.170
I know you do.

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:50.270
Shut up!

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.570
I felt him.

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:55.870
When you held me ...

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:00.770
and you kissed me ...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:05.870
When you made love me,

01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:07.970
there was no fucking doubt.

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:11.370
You love me.

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:14.570
You love me.

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:19.070
You give me the gun,
and I'll get you fixed up.

01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:26.170
Give me the gun.

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:30.470
Danny, don't give him the gun.

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:32.570
It's Ok my little Danny-boy.

01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:33.470
No?

01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:35.170
Don't give him the gun.

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:36.170
It's Ok.

01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:38.770
Get me out of here. Don't, don't ...

01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:41.970
Don't cry.

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:45.170
Don't, don't ...
don't give him the gun.

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:48.170
- Danny, don't listen to him.
- What I'm gonna do? - Danny!

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:52.370
Danny!

01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:29.570
Danny? thank fuck, Danny, just ...

01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:32.770
Please, just ... get me out of here.

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:39.770
Danny ...  Danny ... Danny ...

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.470
Come on.

01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:48.270
- Shoulda listened.
- No.

01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:51.070
It's alright, babe.

01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:54.470
Danny, don't you fucking
leave me here, please!

01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:56.470
Don't you fucking walk away!

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.770
Danny, don't you fucking leave!

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.070
No, Danny. Come back!

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.870
Danny! Don't you fucking
leave me here!

01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:05.970
Don't leave me here!

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.970
Danny, come back.
Please come back.

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:16.270
Danny, please ...

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:54.670
Ah, fuck. Give me the keys.

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:04.970
Come on, Vic. Come on. Come on.
Give me the keys. Gimme?

01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:21.270
Come on. Give me the keys.
Don't? please ...
