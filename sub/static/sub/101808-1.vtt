WEBVTT

02:12.758 --> 02:16.262
I want to eat

02:23.227 --> 02:28.607
and violent

02:32.820 --> 02:37.283
:

03:21.827 --> 03:23.662
let me get there

03:26.999 --> 03:29.668
let me, let me

03:32.296 --> 03:33.714
:

03:33.797 --> 03:37.301
let me get there

03:37.384 --> 03:41.931
:

05:45.888 --> 05:46.722
Lulu!

06:06.533 --> 06:07.951
Mmm.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.036
Lou.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.204
Stop.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.371
Lou, it’s up time.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.623
Mm-hmm.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.129
Up time.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.090
Huh?

06:21.173 --> 06:23.217
-Yeah.
-Come on.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.179
Come on, stop that.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.389
We got to get right to it
for grizzle. Remember?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.599
Okay.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.478
Yo, I got some smoothie for you.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.188
You’re gonna fuckin’ hate it.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.273
But it’s healthy.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.275
Want some?
I wouldn’t recommend it.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.236
-It’s disgusting.
-Mm-mm.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.289
Okay, poops.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.332
Dance time.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.900
:

07:28.073 --> 07:32.870
for something

07:41.420 --> 07:45.674
in our lives

07:45.757 --> 07:49.928
-

07:52.890 --> 07:54.558
Yes!

07:58.312 --> 08:02.774
-

08:11.950 --> 08:13.118
-No?
-

08:13.202 --> 08:14.119
Nah? No?

08:14.203 --> 08:15.329
Okay.

08:18.957 --> 08:22.586
And I would do
anything for love

08:22.669 --> 08:24.630
RUBEN:

08:24.713 --> 08:27.007
What’s the thing that
he won’t do in that song?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.675
What’s left for him to not do?

08:28.759 --> 08:29.760
LOU:
Anal.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.846
-

08:34.348 --> 08:36.558
RUBEN: I used to imagine
Jeff Goldblum was my dad.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.435
Saw him in The fucking Fly,
I was like,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.103
"Yo, that must be what
my dad looks like."

08:40.187 --> 08:42.564
Also explains a lot,
’cause the dude’s fucking weird.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.857
But he looks like me, man.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.525
-It’s true, yeah.
-Yeah!

08:45.609 --> 08:47.194
You kind of look
like Jeff Goldblum.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.112
RUBEN: Why is it okay to, like,
use a toothpick in public

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
but not floss?
Have you ever tried that?

08:51.114 --> 08:53.325
-LOU: To floss my teeth in
public? No. -To floss in public.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.452
Like, you’re just at the dinner
table, you just pull out some...

08:55.535 --> 08:57.120
LOU: I used to imagine
my funeral a lot

08:57.204 --> 08:59.331
when I was a kid...
at school in math.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.832
RUBEN:
Fun!

09:00.916 --> 09:02.542
LOU: I used to daydream
about my funeral.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.461
Then I’d make myself cry!

09:04.544 --> 09:06.755
Uh, yeah, I think
I’d get cremated.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.756
What about you?

09:07.839 --> 09:09.174
RUBEN:
Cremated...

09:09.258 --> 09:10.926
or, like, just fed to the birds,
you know?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.719
LOU:
Well, you know, now you can get

09:12.803 --> 09:16.014
ashes put into tattoo ink.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.058
-My face on your back.
-RUBEN: Your face?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.810
LOU:
Where the clown is.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.270
-RUBEN: What?
-LOU: Yeah.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.523
RUBEN:

09:34.032 --> 09:36.326
Yo, we don’t need to... we don’t
need to put ’em all out.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.829
I know, but we just need
to fill ’em up a little bit.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.372
-Okay.
-That’s good.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.375
You want to put out...
put out some different ones?

09:43.458 --> 09:45.502
Hmm?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.296
That’s the face of a sale.

09:48.505 --> 09:52.301
Okay, this one costs, uh,
50 bucks extra because...

09:52.384 --> 09:54.886
-It’s an original artwork.
-I’m gonna spit on.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.638
-A $50... Oh!
-Okay, a hundred bucks.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.515
-That’s ten grand.
-

09:58.598 --> 10:01.393
-Did you guys sound-check?
-No, not yet.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.686
We’re going on at...

10:02.769 --> 10:04.438
-5:00?
-Did Margaret sound-check yet?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.023
Yo, you sound-checked yet?

10:06.106 --> 10:06.940
No.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.608
Not looking forward to it.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.985
Terrified.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.695
Half my shit is broken down.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.991
-

10:26.918 --> 10:29.212
-

12:00.720 --> 12:01.930
:
Ah.

12:02.848 --> 12:03.974
Ah.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.356
:
Ah.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.109
Ah.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.867
It’s... it’s probably
a two out of ten

13:03.950 --> 13:06.203
in terms of his hearing.
He can’t...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.663
He’s having trouble
even communicating with me.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.708
It-it’s...

13:42.489 --> 13:44.199
I got to see a doctor?

13:44.282 --> 13:46.618
He... he can see you now.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.746
-What?
-He can see you right-right now.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.165
-Now?
-Yes, I-I...

13:57.587 --> 13:59.214
Hey, Lulu. Uh, sorry
I had to run out, baby.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.132
I got to deal
with some shit, okay?

14:01.216 --> 14:02.926
Don’t worry about anything,
okay?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.933
WOMAN:
Mr. Stone?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.229
Oh. Oh, yeah.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.234
:
Ah.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.823
:
Okay, how is that volume?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.741
Is the volume loud enough?

14:26.825 --> 14:27.784
Good.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.202
Can you hear me?

14:29.286 --> 14:31.413
: What?
-You can hear me okay?

14:31.496 --> 14:33.206
-Volume-wise?
-I can hear you.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.000
Okay.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.918
I’m gonna say these words.

14:37.002 --> 14:40.088
I want you to repeat them
back to me.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.882
I’m gonna start
with just your right ear.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.593
Okay?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.137
Bass.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.016
Bass.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.311
Mess.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.897
Car.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.234
Mop.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.154
:
Noisy.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.572
DOCTOR:
Search.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.616
Throat.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.035
-Ditch.
-Fish.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.244
Talk.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.662
T...

15:15.915 --> 15:17.751
Ring.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.586
Broom.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.046
Germ.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.801
DOCTOR:
Life.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.556
Team.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.270
Lid.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.985
Lid.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.823
This is your chart, Ruben.

15:48.907 --> 15:52.452
Now, as far as the volume
that you can hear,

15:52.535 --> 15:56.081
you, on your right ear,
were 28%,

15:56.164 --> 15:58.875
and on your left ear,
you were 24%.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.877
-It’s what?
-In the left ear,

16:00.960 --> 16:02.128
you came in at 24%.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.171
Okay.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.132
No matter how loud
I made the test--

16:06.216 --> 16:09.552
I could have put it at 11--
you were still going to miss

16:09.636 --> 16:13.556
70% to 80% of the words
that I said.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.683
Okay.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.684
That is not good.

16:15.767 --> 16:16.810
Yeah, I see that.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.561
So, what...

16:18.645 --> 16:19.979
What can we do about it?

16:20.063 --> 16:21.272
How do I get it back?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.649
Well, um...

16:22.732 --> 16:26.069
you have to understand
something here.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.822
Whether or not
this is related to

16:28.905 --> 16:30.907
your exposure to noise

16:30.990 --> 16:34.035
or it’s an autoimmune issue

16:34.119 --> 16:35.704
doesn’t really matter.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.414
I understand I got a problem.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.541
I’m asking you
what I can do about it.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.085
Well, what you can do
about it first

16:42.168 --> 16:46.548
is to eliminate all exposure
to loud noises.

16:46.631 --> 16:50.844
And then we can run some tests
and we can determine exactly

16:50.927 --> 16:53.722
what is going on with your ears.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.641
And if we do, then we can have
our other conversations.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.226
We can have what?

16:58.309 --> 17:02.939
Well, there are implants
that bypass the cochlea.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.816
You said implants?

17:04.899 --> 17:06.359
-Yes.
-Those work?

17:06.443 --> 17:08.862
For people with
severe hearing loss or

17:08.945 --> 17:11.114
complete deafness,
yes, they help.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.949
Well, then let’s do that.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.994
Well, it’s not that simple.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.913
Uh, it’s a very involved
process, and it’s quite costly.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.623
How much is it?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.501
Well, they can run
between $40,000 and $80,000,

17:23.585 --> 17:27.297
depending, and they are not
covered by insurance.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.471
Okay.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.972
And, um...

17:37.390 --> 17:38.808
Like, when-when can you do it?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.310
You got ’em in stock now?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.520
Mr. Stone, your hearing

17:42.604 --> 17:46.024
is deteriorating rapidly.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.859
Am I right?

17:48.693 --> 17:51.946
And over the next few days,

17:52.030 --> 17:54.908
or even hours,
it’s going to continue.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.952
And the hearing
that you have lost

17:58.036 --> 18:00.288
is not coming back.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.625
:
You have to understand

18:03.708 --> 18:06.044
your first responsibility

18:06.127 --> 18:08.880
is to preserve
the hearing you have.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.837
-

18:48.920 --> 18:52.215
-

19:26.457 --> 19:28.376
-LOU: Ruben, what the fuck?

19:59.699 --> 20:02.619
Yes, it’ll come back.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.329
I have to...

20:05.246 --> 20:06.873
There’s, like, a surgery.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.542
What?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.794
It’s simple. It’s all it is.
There’s an implant.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.171
They put it in your shit.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.714
It’s like a...

20:14.797 --> 20:17.050
Okay, it’ll come back.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.384
It’s fine, Lou.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.219
It’s, like, 40 grand,
80 grand, whatever,

20:20.303 --> 20:21.512
but it’s...

20:21.596 --> 20:22.805
it’ll come back.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.515
Till then, Lou,
we just keep going, okay?

20:24.599 --> 20:27.268
-No. No.
-Lou. Listen to me.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.770
Let’s play tomorrow,
let’s see what it’s like.

20:28.853 --> 20:29.854
Let’s try it, okay?

20:29.938 --> 20:31.230
I’m gonna be like a click track.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.482
You can play to me.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.900
-No.
-Huh? You can adj...

20:33.983 --> 20:35.818
It’s different,
but it is what it is, Lou.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.119
Lou, we have a t...
Lou, we have a tour booked.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.747
-It’s not safe.
-We have a tour booked.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.749
-We have a tour booked, Lou.
-No.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.459
-It doesn’t matter.
It doesn’t matter. -Yes, we do.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.628
-It’s not safe, it’s not safe.
-We have a tour booked!

20:55.463 --> 20:58.007
-Ruben.
-I don’t fucking...

21:04.597 --> 21:06.349
:
Yo!

21:06.432 --> 21:08.226
You got a smoke, please?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.049
This is ridiculous.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.433
He’s sleeping.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.392
Hi.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.643
Hi, Hector?

21:50.727 --> 21:52.186
Hi. This is Lou.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.355
Ruben’s having a bit of...
a bit of trouble right now.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.523
-He’s...
-Hey, Hector, what’s up?

21:55.606 --> 21:57.483
He’s got some hearing problems.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.528
Yeah, I mean, I can put him on,

22:00.611 --> 22:02.530
but he won’t be able
to hear you.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.907
Okay.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.201
Talk to him. Talk to him.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.623
Hey, Hector,
what’s going on, man?

22:12.707 --> 22:13.875
It’s Ruben.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.501
I’d say it’s good
to hear your voice,

22:15.585 --> 22:17.587
but I can’t hear a fuckin’ word
you’re saying right now.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.172
So this is completely pointless.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.008
Lou wanted me to call you
because I had a cigarette.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.678
Uh, you know,
not great, not ideal, but...

22:25.762 --> 22:29.682
considering the circumstances,
which are pretty fucked up,

22:29.766 --> 22:30.975
you know, understandable.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.310
I’d say understandable,

22:32.393 --> 22:34.270
for everyone apart from Lou,
it seems.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.230
Um, I got this, bro.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.858
I know you’d probably be asking
me if I’m steady right now,

22:38.941 --> 22:40.777
if I’m feeling level.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.529
Not completely, but I’m cool.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.782
You’d tell me serenity
is something you get

22:45.865 --> 22:49.702
when you, uh, stop wishing
for a different past.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.204
Bro, I love you, man.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.289
Oh, my manager wants the...
wants the phone back,

22:53.372 --> 22:54.540
so I got to go.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.000
Okay, love you, bro.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.544
Hey.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.713
Yeah, he-he can’t hear a word.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.844
Well, if you get him to a group,
then how is he gonna hear?

23:09.847 --> 23:11.182
Okay.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.520
Okay, tha-thanks, Hector,
thank you.

23:16.771 --> 23:17.980
When? When?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.774
Okay, yeah,
I’ll make sure it’s on loud.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.068
Okay, thank you so much.
Thank you.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.154
Okay, bye.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.788
He’s gonna call back.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.249
What did he say?

23:36.332 --> 23:37.917
Write it down.
Tell... What did he...

23:43.673 --> 23:45.967
"Call back."

23:48.052 --> 23:49.929
He’s gonna call back--
that’s all?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.556
Fuckin’ Hector.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.768
What are we gonna do now?

24:04.235 --> 24:06.821
What do you want to do, Lou?

24:06.904 --> 24:08.281
Huh?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.677
RUBEN:
Fuck this.

24:37.518 --> 24:38.769
It’s Hector.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.984
Hey.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.402
Yeah, he’s here.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.531
Not so good.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.996
Oh. Okay.

24:57.079 --> 25:01.042
Uh, yeah, what-what...
what is it and...

25:01.125 --> 25:02.835
What? What’s the plan?

25:02.919 --> 25:05.129
Uh...

25:05.213 --> 25:08.257
Well, we’re-we’re in Missouri,
so that’s gonna take a few days.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.760
I don’t... I don’t really know.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.972
No, no, no,
we’ll leave right away.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.642
Okay, yeah.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.101
Okay, thank you.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.645
Thank you so much.
I really, really appreciate it.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.271
Thank you.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.440
No, yeah, I’ll tell him.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.441
Okay.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.068
Bye.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.365
What?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.287
He’s found a place.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.993
RUBEN:
Is that him?

27:51.128 --> 27:53.214
Ruben.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.216
Hi. I don’t...
I’m sorry, I don’t know that.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.884
I’m Ruben.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.219
Yeah, this is Lou.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.678
Hi. I’m... I’m Lou.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.055
I’m sorry, I read lips.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.181
M-My name is Lou.

28:02.264 --> 28:05.059
-Lou. I’m Joe.
-Hi, Joe.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.728
-You mind if I borrow him
for a minute? -No.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.939
All right, you mind
watching my beast here for me

28:10.022 --> 28:11.232
while we have a talk?

28:11.315 --> 28:12.358
Well, okay.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.527
-Lou, this is Louie.
-Oh.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.861
He’s my hearing dog.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.155
He let me know you were here.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.990
I named it after Louie Aparicio

28:20.074 --> 28:22.034
-from the White Sox in ’59.
-Okay.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.661
You want to be
best friends with him,

28:23.744 --> 28:25.204
-give him one of these.
-Oh, sure.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.039
-Okay?
-Yeah.

28:29.875 --> 28:30.751
RUBEN:
Yo, what about...

28:30.835 --> 28:32.086
Lou, you coming?

28:32.169 --> 28:33.170
No, no, you.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.588
-You sure?
-Yeah.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.882
-I won’t be long, okay?
-Okay.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.636
JOE:
You be a good boy!

29:21.469 --> 29:23.179
Okay. Uh...

29:23.262 --> 29:24.930
Test.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.558
Oh.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.615
Okay.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.576
So, it works.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.329
Is this okay for you?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.497
Yeah, can you hear me?

29:49.580 --> 29:52.458
No.
No, I’m gonna read your lips.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.543
I might miss some things,
but I’m gonna try, okay?

29:54.627 --> 29:57.004
-Okay.
-Just try, try to speak clearly.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.589
Yeah.

30:00.883 --> 30:02.510
How are you, Ruben?

30:06.472 --> 30:08.182
I’m okay.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.104
You’re an addict?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.191
Yeah.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.028
What sort of drugs?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.281
What’d I take?

30:25.115 --> 30:26.575
Mm-hmm.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.499
Um...

30:34.750 --> 30:36.710
Mainly heroin.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.170
Heroin.

30:39.964 --> 30:43.342
Have you thought about using
since you lost your hearing?

30:57.815 --> 30:59.984
Today is not a good day.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.661
I’m not thinking clear today.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.916
Let’s talk about me.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.293
I’m an alcoholic.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.421
I lost my hearing
in the Vietnam War

31:20.504 --> 31:23.674
when a bomb exploded near me.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.759
I still remember the music
I was listening to

31:25.843 --> 31:26.969
when that bomb went off.

31:28.512 --> 31:32.558
After that,
I lost everything else--

31:32.641 --> 31:35.769
my wife, my kid.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.980
Not because of being deaf,
mind you, Ruben.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.356
It was the beer.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.570
How long you been clean?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.323
Four years.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.825
-Four?
-Mmm.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.494
And you need some help
right now?

31:53.746 --> 31:55.706
Yo, I should check on Lou.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.251
How long you two been together?

32:00.628 --> 32:02.963
Four years.

32:03.047 --> 32:06.342
-

32:25.736 --> 32:27.905
You play music, right?

32:27.988 --> 32:29.323
-No.
-No?

32:29.406 --> 32:30.532
No, not anymore.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.284
Not until I get the implant.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.536
-Implant?
-Yeah.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.039
Sorry, you know about
these implants they got now?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.375
It’s like... it’s like, uh...
th-they have implants.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.419
I know. Yes.

32:42.503 --> 32:43.504
Expensive.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.757
Yeah. Thank you.
Yes, they are.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.258
So...

32:50.094 --> 32:52.012
You should understand that, uh,

32:52.096 --> 32:53.389
this is a Deaf community.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.849
Not just my program,
but we’re part

32:55.933 --> 32:57.935
of a larger Deaf community.

32:58.018 --> 33:01.814
And my program,
and the people in it,

33:01.897 --> 33:05.275
they benefit tremendously
from that Deaf community.

33:05.359 --> 33:06.944
We work with them,

33:07.027 --> 33:08.445
and they work with us.

33:08.529 --> 33:11.448
But it’s very important,

33:11.532 --> 33:12.950
if you want to be here,

33:13.033 --> 33:14.451
to understand
that we’re looking for

33:14.535 --> 33:16.245
a solution to...

33:16.328 --> 33:18.122
to this...

33:19.081 --> 33:20.290
...not this.

33:23.585 --> 33:26.130
Why don’t you go
invite Lou in here?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.427
Sure.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.806
Lou!

33:42.896 --> 33:44.857
This guy wants to talk to you.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.775
Okay.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.114
Well... I think it’s important

33:52.197 --> 33:54.658
that you stay here
with us right now, Ruben,

33:54.742 --> 33:56.410
learn some sign language,

33:56.493 --> 33:58.412
find some solid ground.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.956
What do you think?

34:01.039 --> 34:02.458
Man, it sounds great,

34:02.541 --> 34:04.209
but we don’t have
a lot of money right now.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.879
JOE: Well, sometimes our church
sponsors deaf people in need,

34:06.962 --> 34:08.714
and right now,

34:08.797 --> 34:10.507
you fit the bill, Ruben.

34:10.591 --> 34:11.925
Uh, we’re really not

34:12.009 --> 34:13.510
-churchgoing people.
-Sorry, I-I read...

34:13.594 --> 34:15.095
Sorry, Ruben, I read lips.
I can’t...

34:15.179 --> 34:16.472
What’d you say?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.975
We’re not religious,
either of us.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.393
Very much not into religion.

34:21.477 --> 34:22.811
No offense, you know.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.105
Religion plays no part
in this, Ruben.

34:25.189 --> 34:26.648
The church helps

34:26.732 --> 34:28.692
people in need,
not religious people.

34:28.776 --> 34:31.069
The important thing is that
you want to stay here.

34:31.153 --> 34:32.529
Mmm.

34:32.613 --> 34:33.655
Yeah.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.907
Lou?

34:34.990 --> 34:37.493
Do you think Ruben
needs help right now?

34:41.330 --> 34:43.415
You understand, if, uh...

34:43.499 --> 34:45.125
Ruben were to stay here,

34:45.209 --> 34:46.960
he’d have to do it on his own.

34:47.044 --> 34:50.631
Members live in a house
separate from the outside world.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.090
No contact to the outside world,

34:52.174 --> 34:54.134
no phones.

34:54.218 --> 34:57.387
I’ve found that in all cases,
that’s the way it works best.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.097
Yo, hold up a minute, okay?

34:59.181 --> 35:01.350
Let me catch up. Okay?

35:02.476 --> 35:04.228
Can you help Ruben commit
to that, Lou?

35:06.230 --> 35:07.689
You want... you want to
try this for a couple days?

35:07.773 --> 35:08.607
We have our own home.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.526
We can stay in the RV.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.236
No, I’m sorry to say,
that’s not the way

35:12.319 --> 35:13.153
that it works here, Ruben.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.197
Well, that’s a problem, then.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.033
Do you have anywhere you can be
during this time, Lou?

35:19.910 --> 35:22.538
Yo, that’s that, man.
We’re done.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.580
We’re done.

35:23.664 --> 35:24.706
Thanks a lot for your time, bro.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.874
Appreciate it, okay?

35:25.958 --> 35:27.334
We’re out, baby. Let’s go.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.865
Hey.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.660
I’m thinking
we should still go hit

36:01.743 --> 36:03.161
our fuckin’ show in Dayton.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.372
Okay? I can... I can
fuckin’ watch you for cues.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.499
I know it was rocky last time,
but we did...

36:07.583 --> 36:08.959
we weren’t on the same page.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.961
Now you know what’s up,
I can fuckin’ watch you.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.005
And I know this shit inside out.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.631
Okay, yo.
I can fuckin’ make it work

36:14.715 --> 36:17.968
until we have enough
for surgery.

36:18.051 --> 36:18.886
Okay?

36:18.969 --> 36:21.013
We’re gonna get there.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.432
Yo, seriously, we’re good to go.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.975
Lou.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.060
Hmm?

36:27.144 --> 36:29.062
Hey, I’ll deal with this shit.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.147
I’ll deal with it.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.940
You know I fucking will.
It’s just money.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.859
You know that, right? Huh?

36:36.653 --> 36:38.196
Come here.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.923
Ruben!

36:58.050 --> 37:00.636
Ruben! Ruben!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.179
Stop it!

37:08.560 --> 37:10.062
Ruben!

37:17.653 --> 37:19.738
-

37:25.035 --> 37:26.620
Lou, look at me.
I’m not going back

37:26.703 --> 37:28.580
to that fuckin’ place, okay?

37:30.499 --> 37:32.000
I know. I know.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.001
I’m...

37:36.922 --> 37:39.299
Well, then fuckin’ support me.

37:39.383 --> 37:42.344
How’s about that?
Fuckin’ support me, Lou.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.262
Huh?

37:45.889 --> 37:46.974
You don’t want to be here?

37:48.100 --> 37:49.685
-Of course I do.
-I knew it.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.812
I fuckin’ knew it.
I fuckin’ knew this was coming.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.146
I fuckin’ knew it.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.523
This is about
the fuckin’ album, huh?

37:54.606 --> 37:56.525
What happened?
You get a better offer?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.859
-What are you talking about?
-Huh?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.152
-What are you saying?
-I can’t hear...

37:59.236 --> 38:01.029
I can’t hear you.
I can’t fucking hear you!

38:01.113 --> 38:03.657
Do you understand me?
I can’t. I’m fuckin’ deaf.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.616
I’m fucking deaf!

38:04.700 --> 38:05.534
No fucking hearing!

38:05.617 --> 38:08.203
Okay? Okay?

38:12.499 --> 38:15.168
No, what I need... what I need
is a fucking gun in my mouth.

38:15.252 --> 38:17.629
What I need is a fucking gun
in my fucking mouth!

38:17.713 --> 38:18.714
Okay?!

38:24.177 --> 38:25.262
Look, I’m sorry.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.805
Lou, I’m just fucked up
a little.

38:26.888 --> 38:29.057
I just need a little...
I need a minute to think.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.142
Okay?

38:32.352 --> 38:34.312
There’s got to be another way.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.188
Lou?

38:38.650 --> 38:40.068
Hello?

38:40.152 --> 38:41.737
Hey.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.865
Oh, really?

38:46.575 --> 38:47.451
Oh.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.785
Who is that?

38:48.869 --> 38:50.412
Okay, well, I need to get ready.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.956
Okay. No, I’ll get a cab.

38:53.874 --> 38:55.208
Yeah, it’s fine.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.627
Okay, bye.

38:57.711 --> 39:00.130
What’s going on?

39:00.213 --> 39:01.131
Huh?

39:01.214 --> 39:03.175
What’s going on?

39:03.258 --> 39:04.509
I’m getting on a plane,

39:04.593 --> 39:07.095
and you’re gonna go back
to that place.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.186
Just slow down, okay?
Slow down.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.021
Yo, chill, dude.
We’re gonna be a minute.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.440
Just chill. Okay?

39:18.523 --> 39:20.525
Just slow down a minute.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.319
Lou. Lou.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.779
This is so fucked up.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.697
Who’s gonna be looking out
for you over there? Hmm?

39:25.781 --> 39:27.324
-Who’s gonna look out for you?
-It’s okay.

39:27.407 --> 39:28.825
-Don’t say that guy.
-It’s okay. It’s okay.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.744
Lou, I need...
I need more of a plan, Lou.

39:30.827 --> 39:31.870
-Ruben.
-I need...

39:31.953 --> 39:33.914
I need more from you, Lou.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.216
I need more of a plan, Lou.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.218
You can’t just fuckin’...

39:56.228 --> 39:58.522
Ah, Jesus. Lou, come on.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.774
Ruben. Ruben.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.318
You hurt yourself...

40:03.401 --> 40:05.612
Ruben, you hurt yourself,

40:05.695 --> 40:06.988
you hurt me.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.699
I’ll hurt myself, too.
I’ll hurt myself, too.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.743
Don’t say that.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.203
Promise.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.497
Say it, Rubi,
or all of this is for shit.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.623
Say it! Promise!

40:16.706 --> 40:17.999
Go back there right now.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.417
Promise, say it!

40:19.501 --> 40:22.379
-I’ll promise if you...
-No, say it, promise.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.259
Go back to that place.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.594
I... only if... I need...

40:29.678 --> 40:31.721
I need you to wait for me.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.099
Okay? You’re it for me, Lou.
You’re my fuckin’ heart.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.517
You’re it for me.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.270
Okay? You got to wait for me.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.612
Fuck.

40:50.574 --> 40:51.867
Listen to me. Listen, listen.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.953
When you get there,
I need you to...

40:55.036 --> 40:57.247
I need you to write to me, okay?

40:57.330 --> 41:00.792
Yeah? Will you write me
and tell me you’re okay?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.169
Huh? Promise me?

41:02.252 --> 41:03.587
And listen, if it’s...

41:03.670 --> 41:05.755
if it’s bullshit,
you just get your ass back here.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.257
I’ll fix it, I swear to God.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.508
You know I’ll fuckin’ fix this.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.343
This is not that hard, okay?

41:10.427 --> 41:12.304
Just come back here.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.475
-I love you.
-You’re my fucking heart.

41:17.559 --> 41:18.810
Okay?

41:21.229 --> 41:22.731
Motherfucker.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.900
-Oh, motherf...
-

41:33.241 --> 41:35.452
-Fuck.
-

41:38.663 --> 41:40.665
:
Motherfucker.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.548
Oh.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.139
Fuck.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.017
Motherfucker.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.490
RUBEN:
What’s up?

42:56.992 --> 42:58.201
Yo.

42:58.285 --> 42:59.619
Hey.

43:27.814 --> 43:28.982
You want my car keys?

43:40.243 --> 43:43.204
If I ask for ’em back,
I want ’em back, okay?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.543
We’re not doing that.

45:03.493 --> 45:05.036
Your name.

45:06.121 --> 45:07.664
My name’s Ruben.

45:07.747 --> 45:09.374
I’m an addict.

45:09.457 --> 45:11.751
I have four years clean now.

45:11.835 --> 45:13.294
I’m sorry I don’t...

45:13.378 --> 45:14.629
talk sign language.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.131
That’s it.

45:24.431 --> 45:27.475
My name is Shaheem.

45:27.559 --> 45:30.478
I’m a heroin addict.

46:55.396 --> 46:56.773
Oh...

46:56.856 --> 46:58.399
:
Fuck.

49:17.121 --> 49:18.539
What?

49:21.584 --> 49:22.502
Okay.

49:39.602 --> 49:42.146
:
I know, right?

50:04.919 --> 50:07.130
Um, I don’t...

50:07.213 --> 50:09.048
Sorry.

50:30.403 --> 50:31.988
Ruben.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.073
Ruben.

51:10.151 --> 51:11.277
Oh.

51:29.545 --> 51:30.546
Okay.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.595
Yeah.

52:13.214 --> 52:16.509
-

52:21.681 --> 52:24.976
-

52:32.316 --> 52:33.526
Uh, I’m coming.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.486
Okay? One minute.

52:35.570 --> 52:36.737
I-I’ll... I’ll be back.

53:53.314 --> 53:54.315
Fuck.

54:25.054 --> 54:26.055
Oh, hey, Joe.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.437
What was that all about, Ruben?

54:37.274 --> 54:39.068
Oh, with your roof?

54:39.151 --> 54:40.444
I was fixing your roof.

54:40.528 --> 54:41.946
It’s, like,
one of the eaves is...

54:42.029 --> 54:44.115
:
I was trying to fix your roof.

54:44.198 --> 54:47.118
You don’t need to fix
anything here.

54:58.754 --> 55:00.214
I’ve got a little, uh...

55:00.297 --> 55:02.466
assignment for you. Okay?

55:02.550 --> 55:05.803
You get up early, right?

55:05.886 --> 55:07.680
Yeah, pretty early, yeah.

55:09.181 --> 55:10.850
I’ll have hot coffee

55:10.933 --> 55:12.351
waiting for you

55:12.435 --> 55:14.186
at 5:30.

55:14.270 --> 55:16.522
Early enough for you?

55:19.859 --> 55:21.485
I don’t know. I guess.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.654
Okay, 5:00.

55:23.738 --> 55:25.656
And I’ll, uh,

55:25.740 --> 55:27.742
provide a room for you.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.577
What for?

55:29.660 --> 55:32.580
And there’s nothing that needs
to be accomplished in this room.

55:32.663 --> 55:35.499
All I want you to do is just...

55:36.625 --> 55:38.419
...sit.

55:41.881 --> 55:45.134
All I ask is if and when
you cannot just sit,

55:45.217 --> 55:47.511
you turn yourself
to the pen and paper

55:47.595 --> 55:49.930
that I’m going to supply
for you.

55:50.014 --> 55:52.099
And I want you to...

55:53.309 --> 55:54.935
...write.

55:56.187 --> 55:58.189
Doesn’t matter what you write,
how you write,

55:58.272 --> 56:00.357
whether it’s spelled correctly.

56:00.441 --> 56:02.610
Or if it’s just a big...

56:02.693 --> 56:04.403
...mess.

56:04.487 --> 56:06.280
I don’t care.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.908
No one will read it, okay?

56:08.991 --> 56:10.993
But I want you to keep writing

56:11.077 --> 56:12.912
continuously without stopping

56:12.995 --> 56:15.790
until you feel like you can...

56:18.000 --> 56:20.086
...sit again.

56:35.351 --> 56:37.520
-Does it have to be writing?
-Writing, yes.

56:37.603 --> 56:40.397
No drawing. Writing, yes.

56:45.111 --> 56:47.613
And if...
sometime in the future,

56:47.696 --> 56:50.908
it feels like it’s a little bit
too difficult for you,

56:50.991 --> 56:53.953
you should come and find me.

56:54.036 --> 56:56.330
I’ll be in my apartment

56:56.413 --> 56:59.625
doing the same thing as you,
okay, Ruben?

57:04.839 --> 57:06.757
I’ll be writing, too.

57:09.885 --> 57:11.220
Okay.

58:54.573 --> 58:56.283
-

59:04.333 --> 59:05.751
Mmm, nice.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.795
-Nice, nice, nice.
-

59:07.878 --> 59:10.005
So fucking stupid.

59:16.971 --> 59:19.765
:
It’s so fucking stupid.

59:23.394 --> 59:25.271
You fucking idiot.

59:38.117 --> 59:40.744
What a fucking idiot.

1:02:35.586 --> 1:02:37.004
Hey.

1:02:38.589 --> 1:02:40.424
You think he’s okay?

1:02:43.469 --> 1:02:44.595
You okay?

1:02:44.678 --> 1:02:46.305
-No.
-Not feeling better?

1:02:46.388 --> 1:02:47.723
Come on over.

1:02:49.558 --> 1:02:51.226
Look at those flowers.

1:03:00.736 --> 1:03:03.030
He’s quick.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:18.253
All right, come here, my friend.

1:03:19.630 --> 1:03:21.965
See, I knew he had it.

1:03:47.157 --> 1:03:48.283
A, B, C,

1:03:48.367 --> 1:03:49.660
D, E, F,

1:03:49.743 --> 1:03:50.869
G, H, I, J,

1:03:50.953 --> 1:03:53.080
K, L, M, N--

1:03:53.163 --> 1:03:54.414
R, S, T,

1:03:54.498 --> 1:03:55.415
U, V, W,

1:03:55.499 --> 1:03:56.959
X, Y, Z.

1:04:01.088 --> 1:04:02.756
He won.

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:04.883
-No, no, he won.
-It was close.

1:04:04.967 --> 1:04:06.635
No, he won. You can go again
if you want to.

1:04:06.718 --> 1:04:08.762
Again! Again! Again! Again!

1:04:13.517 --> 1:04:15.060
A, B, C, D,

1:04:15.143 --> 1:04:16.186
G, H, I,

1:04:16.270 --> 1:04:17.354
J, K, L,

1:04:17.437 --> 1:04:19.773
T, U, V, O, Q--

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:20.941
R, S, T,

1:04:21.024 --> 1:04:22.150
U, V, W,

1:04:22.234 --> 1:04:23.735
X, Y, Z.

1:04:23.819 --> 1:04:24.945
Yes!

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:28.824
See?

1:04:29.575 --> 1:04:30.576
Good job! You did it!

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:18.999
No, I thought...

1:05:20.083 --> 1:05:22.419
I thought you said
you were smart.

1:05:22.502 --> 1:05:24.087
But your wife and your daughter

1:05:24.171 --> 1:05:26.381
are better, right?

1:05:27.257 --> 1:05:28.675
See? He knows!

1:05:30.218 --> 1:05:33.930
-He already knows.
-

1:05:44.358 --> 1:05:45.692
I don’t like it
completely shaved.

1:05:45.776 --> 1:05:48.028
I prefer it with a little hair.

1:05:58.497 --> 1:06:00.749
Whoa, not too much.

1:06:00.832 --> 1:06:01.792
Natural, got it.

1:06:01.875 --> 1:06:03.627
Trimmed and all, ya know?

1:06:08.382 --> 1:06:09.508
Lovely.

1:06:09.591 --> 1:06:10.759
Who is she?

1:06:15.138 --> 1:06:16.890
Okay, okay.

1:06:20.435 --> 1:06:22.354
Where do you want it?

1:06:24.564 --> 1:06:27.442
-Right here.
-

1:06:32.823 --> 1:06:34.282
I like it.

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:46.962
Cool. Thank you.

1:07:05.689 --> 1:07:06.857
My bad.

1:07:08.108 --> 1:07:09.443
Watch me.

1:07:11.236 --> 1:07:12.404
Slowly.

1:08:27.395 --> 1:08:30.148
I feel a little bit old today.

1:08:32.067 --> 1:08:34.027
You are old.

1:08:36.488 --> 1:08:37.864
I love your name sign...

1:08:37.948 --> 1:08:39.115
Ruben.

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:44.246
That first day you were here,

1:08:44.329 --> 1:08:47.123
you reminded me of an owl.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:51.711
-O-W-L?
-Owl.

1:08:51.795 --> 1:08:52.921
Fuck you.

1:09:02.138 --> 1:09:04.599
And you’ve become very important

1:09:04.683 --> 1:09:07.060
to a lot of people around here.

1:09:08.645 --> 1:09:10.772
You know? It’s true.

1:09:10.856 --> 1:09:12.607
Thank you.

1:09:14.109 --> 1:09:16.820
I’d like to offer you a...

1:09:16.903 --> 1:09:18.113
a way that

1:09:18.196 --> 1:09:21.575
maybe you can continue on here
with us.

1:09:22.701 --> 1:09:24.077
I imagine you’re starting
to think

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.746
about the future a little bit?

1:09:26.830 --> 1:09:29.082
-Future?
-Future.

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:31.459
I know I am.

1:09:33.712 --> 1:09:36.172
But, uh... I do think
there’s a way

1:09:36.256 --> 1:09:39.217
you could maybe stay
and work here,

1:09:39.301 --> 1:09:42.137
uh, maybe with my program,

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:43.889
maybe...

1:09:43.972 --> 1:09:45.432
with the kids at school.

1:09:46.850 --> 1:09:48.768
Maybe both.

1:09:52.105 --> 1:09:54.107
Anyway...

1:09:55.108 --> 1:09:56.484
...you, uh...

1:09:56.568 --> 1:09:58.278
you think about it, you know?

1:11:18.775 --> 1:11:20.485
What the fuck?

1:12:21.087 --> 1:12:24.966
-

1:14:22.083 --> 1:14:23.168
Her?

1:14:23.251 --> 1:14:25.086
Yeah.

1:14:30.550 --> 1:14:32.051
Yeah.

1:14:32.135 --> 1:14:33.261
Cute.

1:14:34.470 --> 1:14:35.722
What do you think, huh?

1:14:35.805 --> 1:14:36.973
Yo, what do you think?

1:14:37.056 --> 1:14:38.808
This?

1:14:38.892 --> 1:14:40.351
All?

1:14:41.603 --> 1:14:42.729
Yeah.

1:14:43.688 --> 1:14:44.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:14:44.898 --> 1:14:46.274
Wait, yo, it’s easy.

1:14:46.357 --> 1:14:48.234
It’s easy. Just... slowly.

1:14:49.068 --> 1:14:51.237
Yo. It’s for her, huh?

1:14:51.321 --> 1:14:52.322
It’s for her.

1:14:52.405 --> 1:14:54.616
We need money. We need money.

1:14:55.491 --> 1:14:57.452
Huh? It’s for us.

1:15:00.079 --> 1:15:01.497
I’m leveling with you.

1:15:01.581 --> 1:15:03.124
It’s for her.

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:22.602
Yo.

1:15:22.685 --> 1:15:24.020
For-for this?

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:26.105
For this, remember it’s, uh...

1:15:26.189 --> 1:15:27.482
it’s, uh... cash.

1:15:27.565 --> 1:15:28.775
Okay? Not check.

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:29.776
Cool.

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:31.069
Yo.

1:15:31.152 --> 1:15:32.570
You okay?

1:15:32.654 --> 1:15:34.030
Sure?

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.537
Hi. Is that Prince Audiology?

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.289
Can you hear me?

1:17:10.293 --> 1:17:12.211
It’s Stone, Ruben Stone.

1:17:12.295 --> 1:17:14.630
R-U-B-E-N,

1:17:14.714 --> 1:17:17.216
Stone, S-T-O-N-E.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:19.802
I’m confirming an appointment.

1:17:24.057 --> 1:17:26.392
Yeah, I can hold.

1:18:52.061 --> 1:18:53.521
So, listen.

1:18:53.604 --> 1:18:55.314
-What did you say?
Write it down. -Yeah, yeah.

1:18:55.398 --> 1:18:57.650
I can’t hear you.
Write it down.

1:19:18.838 --> 1:19:20.798
I got a proposition for you.

1:19:20.882 --> 1:19:22.467
What’s that?

1:19:22.550 --> 1:19:24.635
What if I give it to you
at this price...

1:19:27.430 --> 1:19:30.266
...but on one condition?

1:19:31.934 --> 1:19:33.811
I have the option
of coming back to you

1:19:33.895 --> 1:19:35.980
within eight weeks.

1:19:36.063 --> 1:19:38.774
Okay?
I get to buy it back off you

1:19:38.858 --> 1:19:40.610
-for ten percent more than this.
-

1:19:40.693 --> 1:19:42.653
But everything has to be
in its current condition.

1:19:42.737 --> 1:19:46.365
Everything has to be
exactly like it is now.

1:19:46.449 --> 1:19:47.700
Hmm?

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:49.494
What do you think?

1:19:49.577 --> 1:19:51.204
:
Why would you want to do that?

1:19:51.287 --> 1:19:52.747
Dude, I can’t hear you.
I’m deaf.

1:19:52.830 --> 1:19:54.665
So it’s... take it or leave it.

1:19:54.749 --> 1:19:56.918
What’s it gonna be?

1:21:43.691 --> 1:21:45.985
-

1:22:10.801 --> 1:22:11.636
You’re back?

1:22:14.472 --> 1:22:16.349
Have a seat here.

1:22:17.224 --> 1:22:18.517
Thank you.

1:22:29.028 --> 1:22:30.154
Um...

1:22:31.030 --> 1:22:32.907
...I did the deed.

1:22:34.784 --> 1:22:36.160
The deed?

1:22:40.498 --> 1:22:41.832
Surgery.

1:22:50.758 --> 1:22:53.177
How’d you get the money?

1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:56.514
I sold my RV and other shit.

1:22:58.766 --> 1:23:00.726
-Okay.
-Look, Joe,

1:23:00.810 --> 1:23:04.313
I really don’t want to
explain myself right now.

1:23:04.397 --> 1:23:05.731
Okay?

1:23:07.108 --> 1:23:08.609
It’s time. Okay?

1:23:08.693 --> 1:23:11.737
It’s time.
I got to do something.

1:23:11.821 --> 1:23:13.114
Right?

1:23:13.197 --> 1:23:15.616
Trying to save
my f-fuckin’ life.

1:23:17.827 --> 1:23:19.078
So, that’s what I’m doing.

1:23:19.161 --> 1:23:21.789
Okay? No one else is
gonna save my life.

1:23:21.872 --> 1:23:23.624
Right?

1:23:23.708 --> 1:23:25.292
If I just sit here
and diddle around,

1:23:25.376 --> 1:23:28.212
what am I gonna have?
Nothing.

1:23:28.295 --> 1:23:29.505
Okay?

1:23:29.588 --> 1:23:30.965
And all this shit?

1:23:31.048 --> 1:23:32.717
Like, what does it matter?
What does it matter?

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:34.218
It just passes.

1:23:34.301 --> 1:23:35.219
Yo.

1:23:35.302 --> 1:23:36.804
If I disappear,

1:23:36.887 --> 1:23:38.472
like, who cares?

1:23:38.556 --> 1:23:40.224
Nobody cares, man.

1:23:40.307 --> 1:23:41.267
Seriously.

1:23:41.350 --> 1:23:42.393
Yo, and that’s okay.

1:23:42.476 --> 1:23:43.644
That’s life.

1:23:44.478 --> 1:23:45.813
That’s life.

1:23:45.896 --> 1:23:48.023
No, for real. Okay?

1:23:48.107 --> 1:23:49.400
It just passes.

1:23:49.483 --> 1:23:51.652
It just fucking...
fucking passes.

1:23:56.198 --> 1:23:58.284
I wonder, uh...

1:23:58.367 --> 1:24:01.787
all these mornings
you’ve been sitting in my study,

1:24:01.871 --> 1:24:04.790
sitting,

1:24:04.874 --> 1:24:06.584
have you...

1:24:06.667 --> 1:24:08.586
had any...

1:24:08.669 --> 1:24:10.421
moments of...

1:24:10.504 --> 1:24:12.506
stillness?

1:24:16.886 --> 1:24:19.138
Because you’re right, Ruben.

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:20.639
The world does keep moving,

1:24:20.723 --> 1:24:22.683
and it can be a damn...

1:24:22.767 --> 1:24:24.477
cruel place.

1:24:25.519 --> 1:24:27.521
But for me...

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:33.027
...those moments of stillness,

1:24:33.110 --> 1:24:35.446
that place, that’s the...

1:24:35.529 --> 1:24:37.198
kingdom of God.

1:24:40.701 --> 1:24:43.496
And that place

1:24:43.579 --> 1:24:45.247
will never abandon you.

1:24:48.751 --> 1:24:50.002
But...

1:24:53.547 --> 1:24:55.800
I see you’ve made your choice.

1:24:55.883 --> 1:24:56.967
Right?

1:24:58.385 --> 1:25:00.262
Yeah.

1:25:02.139 --> 1:25:04.433
And I sincerely hope

1:25:04.517 --> 1:25:07.311
that it brings you happiness,
Ruben.

1:25:11.148 --> 1:25:12.525
Thank you.

1:25:17.488 --> 1:25:21.200
I was wondering, Joe.
I don’t know if it’s possible...

1:25:23.285 --> 1:25:26.580
...but, uh, I need money

1:25:26.664 --> 1:25:29.959
to... just to buy back my RV.

1:25:30.042 --> 1:25:31.210
You know?

1:25:31.293 --> 1:25:33.003
You know, me... me and Lou.

1:25:33.087 --> 1:25:34.713
This is where we live.

1:25:34.797 --> 1:25:38.008
It’s our home. Our home.

1:25:38.092 --> 1:25:40.761
And I can...
I can totally pay you back.

1:25:40.845 --> 1:25:42.012
Just, uh...

1:25:42.096 --> 1:25:44.348
Now I got an issue with time.

1:25:51.772 --> 1:25:53.148
Ruben.

1:25:55.234 --> 1:25:59.154
I don’t understand the situation
that you’ve put yourself in,

1:25:59.238 --> 1:26:00.698
but...

1:26:00.781 --> 1:26:02.658
from where I’m sitting...

1:26:02.741 --> 1:26:05.828
you look and sound
like an addict.

1:26:05.911 --> 1:26:08.497
No, I don’t. Yo, no.

1:26:08.581 --> 1:26:10.249
I’m not... It’s not...

1:26:10.332 --> 1:26:12.167
Not an addi...

1:26:12.251 --> 1:26:13.752
It’s fine. Okay?

1:26:13.836 --> 1:26:16.755
My situation, it’s cool. Okay?

1:26:16.839 --> 1:26:19.717
Seriously,
my girlfriend’s dad is rich,

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:21.468
he can give me...
give me the money.

1:26:21.552 --> 1:26:22.928
Okay? This is nothing.

1:26:23.012 --> 1:26:25.472
You can’t imagine
how nothing this is.

1:26:25.556 --> 1:26:27.182
Seriously.

1:26:29.602 --> 1:26:32.104
I’m fucking stupid.
I’m-I’m sorry to ask.

1:26:32.187 --> 1:26:34.440
I’m sorry. Okay?

1:26:35.733 --> 1:26:37.443
Okay.

1:26:43.449 --> 1:26:47.036
Please, can I stay here
for just...

1:26:47.119 --> 1:26:48.913
three, four weeks?

1:26:48.996 --> 1:26:50.581
Till they...

1:26:50.664 --> 1:26:52.458
activate?

1:26:58.881 --> 1:27:01.216
Ruben.

1:27:01.300 --> 1:27:04.261
As you know, everybody here

1:27:04.345 --> 1:27:06.055
shares in the belief that

1:27:06.138 --> 1:27:08.349
being deaf is not a handicap.

1:27:08.432 --> 1:27:11.060
Not something to fix.

1:27:12.561 --> 1:27:14.772
It’s pretty important
around here.

1:27:16.732 --> 1:27:20.194
All these kids...

1:27:20.277 --> 1:27:22.363
all of us,

1:27:22.446 --> 1:27:25.115
need to be reminded of it

1:27:25.199 --> 1:27:26.784
every day.

1:27:30.079 --> 1:27:33.165
And my house is a house
built on that belief,

1:27:33.248 --> 1:27:35.376
and built on trust.

1:27:37.795 --> 1:27:40.130
And when that trust is violated,

1:27:40.214 --> 1:27:42.299
things happen.

1:27:48.722 --> 1:27:51.058
And I can’t have that.

1:27:52.142 --> 1:27:54.228
There are too many others

1:27:54.311 --> 1:27:56.438
to consider.

1:27:58.399 --> 1:28:00.234
And so,

1:28:00.317 --> 1:28:03.529
in your current state,
at this time...

1:28:05.322 --> 1:28:09.743
I’m going to have to ask you
to pack up your bags today

1:28:09.827 --> 1:28:12.579
and find another place to be,
Ruben.

1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:28.053
Cool.

1:31:33.197 --> 1:31:34.907
Are you ready?

1:31:36.575 --> 1:31:38.368
Okay.

1:31:47.336 --> 1:31:49.296
Here we go.

1:31:56.261 --> 1:31:58.430
-

1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:02.184
:
Can you hear me?

1:32:07.856 --> 1:32:09.107
:
Say again.

1:32:09.191 --> 1:32:11.068
: Can you hear me?
-Whoa.

1:32:12.319 --> 1:32:14.321
How does it sound?

1:32:16.448 --> 1:32:18.533
Uh, sounds weird.

1:32:19.910 --> 1:32:23.872
Okay, well, let’s try
making an adjustment.

1:32:28.418 --> 1:32:30.796
:
How about now? How’s that?

1:32:30.879 --> 1:32:32.589
Oh, that’s bad.

1:32:32.673 --> 1:32:34.675
Um...

1:32:36.510 --> 1:32:38.553
It’s bad.

1:32:40.097 --> 1:32:42.557
: Do you want to
describe what you’re hearing?

1:32:42.641 --> 1:32:44.935
It’s, um...

1:32:45.018 --> 1:32:47.646
It’s, like, high.

1:32:47.729 --> 1:32:48.939
High.

1:32:50.065 --> 1:32:51.525
Um...

1:32:53.485 --> 1:32:55.696
Um...

1:32:55.779 --> 1:32:58.031
:
Can you change the...

1:33:00.367 --> 1:33:03.161
Well, I can try and make
another adjustment.

1:33:07.457 --> 1:33:09.209
:
How’s that?

1:33:12.671 --> 1:33:14.131
Okay.

1:33:14.214 --> 1:33:17.009
: Ruben, this is
not sound like you remember,

1:33:17.092 --> 1:33:19.303
and it’s the implants
in your head

1:33:19.386 --> 1:33:21.471
that’s tricking your brain
into thinking

1:33:21.555 --> 1:33:25.892
that you’re actually hearing,
when in reality

1:33:25.976 --> 1:33:28.186
your ears aren’t working still.

1:33:31.106 --> 1:33:34.693
So, uh, I would suggest
that you take it easy

1:33:34.776 --> 1:33:37.279
for the next few weeks and...

1:33:37.362 --> 1:33:39.197
just...

1:33:39.281 --> 1:33:42.784
get adjusted
to how things sound.

1:33:46.872 --> 1:33:49.666
And just take your time.

1:35:03.698 --> 1:35:07.077
-

1:35:48.326 --> 1:35:50.162
:
Oui?

1:35:50.245 --> 1:35:51.872
Bonjour?

1:35:51.955 --> 1:35:54.833
:
Yeah. Hi. Is that, um...

1:35:54.916 --> 1:35:57.586
Is... is Lou there?

1:35:57.669 --> 1:35:59.421
Hein? C’est qui?

1:35:59.504 --> 1:36:01.381
Who... who is this?

1:36:02.716 --> 1:36:04.134
This is Ruben.

1:36:04.217 --> 1:36:06.470
:
Qui?

1:36:06.553 --> 1:36:08.472
It’s Ruben.

1:36:09.973 --> 1:36:12.392
-Oh.
-Hmm.

1:36:30.535 --> 1:36:31.661
Hey.

1:36:32.829 --> 1:36:34.581
Bonjour, uh...

1:36:34.664 --> 1:36:36.875
-Ruben.
-Come in.

1:36:41.296 --> 1:36:43.548
You are hungry, Ruben?

1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:47.594
RICHARD:
Yes?

1:36:59.814 --> 1:37:01.525
Uh, Louise is not here.

1:37:04.861 --> 1:37:06.196
Uh, you are hearing?

1:37:06.279 --> 1:37:07.864
Y-You are hearing?

1:37:07.948 --> 1:37:10.992
Yeah. I-I had an operation.

1:37:11.076 --> 1:37:12.744
Wow. Yes?

1:37:16.957 --> 1:37:19.543
Oh. What is this? Wait.

1:37:19.626 --> 1:37:20.835
Oh, that’s very good.

1:37:20.919 --> 1:37:23.338
Louise told me
your wish for this.

1:37:25.924 --> 1:37:27.467
Oh.

1:37:30.136 --> 1:37:31.846
And so, uh...

1:37:33.348 --> 1:37:35.141
So, you’re back
to your drums now?

1:37:35.225 --> 1:37:37.686
Uh... not yet.

1:37:37.769 --> 1:37:39.437
I got to... I got to, um...

1:37:39.521 --> 1:37:41.856
I got to deal with
some stuff first, you know?

1:37:41.940 --> 1:37:45.235
Just got to...
got to settle some things.

1:37:45.318 --> 1:37:47.153
Yes, settle...

1:37:47.237 --> 1:37:48.530
Like what?

1:37:48.613 --> 1:37:50.615
You know, just like...

1:37:50.699 --> 1:37:53.451
just getting back into it
and also some financial stuff.

1:37:53.535 --> 1:37:55.620
-Yes. -You know, I just
got to figure it all out.

1:37:55.704 --> 1:37:56.580
Mm-hmm.

1:37:57.831 --> 1:37:59.332
Yes.

1:37:59.416 --> 1:38:01.001
And Louise knows
that you’re here?

1:38:01.084 --> 1:38:03.169
No. No.

1:38:03.253 --> 1:38:04.629
So, it’s a big surprise, oui?

1:38:11.303 --> 1:38:13.471
Well, Louise has been
quite busy, you know?

1:38:14.723 --> 1:38:16.308
Mm-hmm.

1:38:16.391 --> 1:38:19.477
We’re doing a party, so...

1:38:19.561 --> 1:38:21.354
she’ll be back home tonight.

1:38:21.438 --> 1:38:23.523
That’s most certainly.

1:38:28.987 --> 1:38:30.447
Oh, you want...

1:38:30.530 --> 1:38:32.699
I’m going to make you some eggs.

1:38:32.782 --> 1:38:33.908
Oh, no, I’m good.

1:38:33.992 --> 1:38:35.869
Do you need any help
with any of this?

1:38:35.952 --> 1:38:37.037
No, no.

1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:38.622
You need some eggs.

1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:41.541
Thanks.

1:38:43.627 --> 1:38:45.879
Where did you grow, Ruben?

1:38:46.671 --> 1:38:48.131
Where did I grow up?

1:38:48.214 --> 1:38:50.925
-Yes.
-Um... like, all over.

1:38:51.009 --> 1:38:53.887
You know, Texas, California,

1:38:53.970 --> 1:38:55.388
Arizona, Virginia.

1:38:55.472 --> 1:38:57.390
Yeah. All over.

1:38:57.474 --> 1:38:59.559
Why so many places?

1:39:00.393 --> 1:39:02.687
It was... like, uh...

1:39:02.771 --> 1:39:04.939
my mom was a nurse
in the military.

1:39:05.023 --> 1:39:06.775
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

1:39:06.858 --> 1:39:08.943
So she kept moving around.

1:39:09.027 --> 1:39:10.445
And your father, too?

1:39:10.528 --> 1:39:11.446
No.

1:39:11.529 --> 1:39:13.615
I mean, I don’t know.

1:39:13.698 --> 1:39:15.158
I see.

1:39:18.244 --> 1:39:21.122
Uh, I must be honest, I...

1:39:21.206 --> 1:39:24.334
did not always have
good feelings for you, Ruben,

1:39:24.417 --> 1:39:26.878
all these years.

1:39:26.961 --> 1:39:29.964
I confide it is like if one...

1:39:31.549 --> 1:39:34.969
...had stolen something
precious.

1:39:36.221 --> 1:39:38.056
You understand?

1:39:38.139 --> 1:39:40.141
But I know it’s not you
that took

1:39:40.225 --> 1:39:42.018
Louise from me.

1:39:43.144 --> 1:39:44.854
Her mother did that.

1:39:47.148 --> 1:39:49.901
She took Louise
when she left me.

1:39:49.984 --> 1:39:51.903
And she took her again

1:39:51.986 --> 1:39:54.155
when she killed herself.

1:39:56.449 --> 1:39:59.703
And Louise must have
come back home then,

1:39:59.786 --> 1:40:02.414
but she was hating me so much.

1:40:02.497 --> 1:40:04.708
What could I do?

1:40:04.791 --> 1:40:06.960
And you... you...

1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:11.423
Well, y-you gave her
a place to go.

1:40:12.841 --> 1:40:14.592
Then, and...

1:40:14.676 --> 1:40:16.678
this is a good thing.

1:40:17.929 --> 1:40:20.515
Don’t you see, I didn’t like you
much at the time,

1:40:20.598 --> 1:40:22.392
but now I thank you.

1:40:22.475 --> 1:40:24.227
I want to say to you that.

1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.398
But anyhow,

1:40:28.481 --> 1:40:31.526
you’re gonna be so happy
to see how Louise

1:40:31.609 --> 1:40:34.070
is going great now.

1:40:34.154 --> 1:40:35.947
And that’s the most important.

1:40:37.866 --> 1:40:39.409
Isn’t it?

1:40:40.368 --> 1:40:41.828
Hmm?

1:40:41.911 --> 1:40:43.747
Okay.

1:41:27.999 --> 1:41:28.792
Whoa.

1:41:30.084 --> 1:41:32.420
:
Whoa.

1:41:32.504 --> 1:41:34.297
Hi.

1:41:34.380 --> 1:41:36.257
Can you hear me?

1:41:36.341 --> 1:41:38.343
Yeah. Loud and clear.

1:41:39.761 --> 1:41:41.054
Oh, look at you, Lulu.

1:41:41.137 --> 1:41:43.181
Holy shit.

1:41:44.265 --> 1:41:45.600
Look at you, huh?

1:41:45.683 --> 1:41:47.393
-What?
-You look different.

1:41:51.564 --> 1:41:53.483
Whoa, no scratching, huh?

1:41:54.234 --> 1:41:56.319
Oh, yeah.

1:41:56.402 --> 1:41:58.154
That’s good.

1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:19.092
Does it feel weird?

1:42:19.175 --> 1:42:20.802
Yeah. Does it look weird?

1:42:20.885 --> 1:42:22.345
-No.
-

1:42:22.428 --> 1:42:25.181
No, it doesn’t.
It looks really neat.

1:42:25.265 --> 1:42:26.933
Mmm.

1:42:27.767 --> 1:42:29.978
-So crazy.
-Mm-hmm.

1:42:31.229 --> 1:42:32.522
How’d you do it?

1:42:32.605 --> 1:42:34.649
Just worked some magic.

1:42:36.693 --> 1:42:39.153
I have to talk to you about it.

1:42:39.237 --> 1:42:41.698
I had to just move
some things around.

1:42:41.781 --> 1:42:44.367
RICHARD:
Louise, tu descends?

1:42:44.450 --> 1:42:46.160
Um...

1:42:46.244 --> 1:42:49.330
Did Richard tell you
about this party thing tonight?

1:42:49.414 --> 1:42:50.748
Oh, shit, yeah.

1:42:50.832 --> 1:42:52.542
Yeah, I just have to go
and sort some things out.

1:42:52.625 --> 1:42:54.168
-No, it’s great. It’s cool.
-Yeah.

1:42:55.378 --> 1:42:56.462
Go do your thing.

1:42:56.546 --> 1:42:58.047
Okay.

1:42:58.131 --> 1:42:59.591
Do you need anything?

1:42:59.674 --> 1:43:01.885
No, I’m good.

1:43:01.968 --> 1:43:04.095
I’ll just be downstairs.

1:44:01.486 --> 1:44:02.820
Hey. What’s up?

1:44:02.904 --> 1:44:06.157
:
Ruben, mon petite ami.

1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:08.117
What’s up?

1:44:08.201 --> 1:44:10.620
-Come again?
-How are you?

1:44:10.703 --> 1:44:12.330
How are you?

1:44:13.748 --> 1:44:14.999
Did you get some food?

1:44:15.083 --> 1:44:17.251
-Hmm?
-Get some food?

1:44:17.335 --> 1:44:19.420
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:45:07.093 --> 1:45:10.638
:
I would like to make a wish.

1:45:10.722 --> 1:45:14.767
I would like my daughter
to sing a little song with me.

1:45:14.851 --> 1:45:16.185
Papa, no.

1:45:16.269 --> 1:45:19.689
This is my right...
It’s my birthday!

1:45:19.772 --> 1:45:20.898
Come.

1:45:20.982 --> 1:45:23.234
-Oh!
-

1:45:23.317 --> 1:45:25.486
Some of you knew

1:45:25.570 --> 1:45:27.405
Louise’s mother,

1:45:27.488 --> 1:45:29.866
and know that I wrote songs
for her.

1:45:29.949 --> 1:45:31.367
Many.

1:45:31.451 --> 1:45:34.912
And this was your favorite
when you were little.

1:45:34.996 --> 1:45:36.914
Do you remember?

1:48:25.458 --> 1:48:27.001
Hey.

1:48:29.545 --> 1:48:31.172
You okay?

1:48:31.255 --> 1:48:32.965
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

1:49:06.332 --> 1:49:08.459
I just need some water.

1:49:12.964 --> 1:49:15.216
-Are you okay?

1:49:15.299 --> 1:49:16.968
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

1:49:17.051 --> 1:49:18.678
Yeah, it’s just
a little dry in here.

1:49:24.308 --> 1:49:26.435
Hey, that was... that was, uh...

1:49:26.519 --> 1:49:28.813
pretty cool tonight.

1:49:28.896 --> 1:49:30.815
You sounded fucking great.

1:49:30.898 --> 1:49:32.233
-Yeah, right.
-What?

1:49:32.316 --> 1:49:34.026
You’re telling me
you weren’t feeling it?

1:49:34.110 --> 1:49:35.736
-You were in it.
-Well, yeah, well, that’s...

1:49:35.820 --> 1:49:37.822
Straight up, you sounded amazing
singing like that.

1:49:37.905 --> 1:49:40.741
It’s my dad’s stuff, but...

1:49:40.825 --> 1:49:42.702
-And you’re speaking French now?
-Oh, my God, barely.

1:49:42.785 --> 1:49:44.870
I didn’t know you could do that.

1:49:44.954 --> 1:49:46.872
Well, I’ve mostly forgotten,
but...

1:49:46.956 --> 1:49:49.917
it’s coming back a little.

1:49:50.001 --> 1:49:52.003
Yeah, I was thinking,
like, do you remember...

1:49:52.086 --> 1:49:53.796
you remember this place at all?

1:49:55.381 --> 1:49:57.633
I didn’t, but...

1:49:57.717 --> 1:49:59.760
so disconcerting the things that

1:49:59.844 --> 1:50:04.098
your memory holds onto
without you knowing.

1:50:04.181 --> 1:50:05.474
I don’t know, my...

1:50:05.558 --> 1:50:06.976
my mom and I never really
talked about this place.

1:50:07.059 --> 1:50:09.812
It was always some weird,
dreamy idea, but...

1:50:09.895 --> 1:50:11.314
-I mean,

1:50:11.397 --> 1:50:12.982
now it’s come back a little.

1:50:13.065 --> 1:50:15.818
Right.

1:50:15.901 --> 1:50:18.112
Yeah.

1:50:18.195 --> 1:50:22.533
I told everyone about
our little gypsy life together.

1:50:22.616 --> 1:50:24.452
I miss it.

1:50:24.535 --> 1:50:26.078
We got to get back into it.

1:50:26.162 --> 1:50:27.705
You know?
We got to get back on it,

1:50:27.788 --> 1:50:29.248
we got to get back
in the fuckin’...

1:50:29.332 --> 1:50:30.708
-in the groove, huh?
-Mm.

1:50:30.791 --> 1:50:32.001
Don’t you think?

1:50:32.084 --> 1:50:34.128
I got to go get
the Airstream sorted.

1:50:34.211 --> 1:50:35.588
What do you mean "sorted"?

1:50:35.671 --> 1:50:38.049
I just, I just got a shit ton
of things to do.

1:50:38.132 --> 1:50:39.967
-You know? -Right.
Like, with the tour and stuff?

1:50:40.051 --> 1:50:41.344
-Yeah, the fuckin’ tour,
everything. -Yeah.

1:50:41.427 --> 1:50:43.012
Like, we just got to
get back on it,

1:50:43.095 --> 1:50:44.138
-you know, everything.
-Mm-hmm.

1:50:44.221 --> 1:50:45.556
The album, the tour...

1:50:45.639 --> 1:50:47.558
the-the... you know?

1:50:49.393 --> 1:50:51.062
Yeah.

1:50:56.734 --> 1:50:58.444
Hey.

1:51:26.597 --> 1:51:28.641
It’s okay, Lou.

1:51:28.724 --> 1:51:30.684
What?

1:51:34.563 --> 1:51:36.148
It’s okay.

1:51:40.736 --> 1:51:42.446
What’s okay?

1:51:49.203 --> 1:51:51.414
You saved my life.

1:51:53.999 --> 1:51:56.502
You made it...

1:51:56.585 --> 1:51:58.587
you made it beautiful.

1:52:02.174 --> 1:52:03.926
So it’s okay.

1:52:05.761 --> 1:52:07.221
What?

1:52:08.431 --> 1:52:10.558
:
Why are you saying this?

1:52:17.565 --> 1:52:19.775
You saved my life, too, Rubi.

1:53:37.269 --> 1:53:39.563
-

1:57:29.752 --> 1:57:33.964
but I can’t hear anything

1:58:16.006 --> 1:58:19.176
in Durrow now

1:58:29.311 --> 1:58:32.481
something to say

1:58:37.236 --> 1:58:39.363
really it

1:58:50.415 --> 1:58:54.586
I can’t hear anything

1:59:39.172 --> 1:59:41.133
CHILD:
Yay.

2:00:04.239 --> 2:00:06.909
-

2:00:12.039 --> 2:00:15.083
-
