We're not sure yet.

10:21.596 --> 10:24.098
It could be in relation

10:24.132 --> 10:26.000
to an investigation
that Hank was working,

10:26.034 --> 10:29.870
or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

even heard his name

30:27.507 --> 30:30.275
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

30:30.309 --> 30:32.811
<i>Operator.
This is Walter White.</i>

30:32.845 --> 30:34.446
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

30:36.049 --> 30:37.916
[beep]

30:37.950 --> 30:40.886
<i>[Jesse] Yo, we got
problems, big ones.</i>

30:40.920 --> 30:43.455
Reverend,
so nice of you to call...

30:43.489 --> 30:44.690
Again.

30:44.724 --> 30:46.258
Turn your phone on already.

30:46.292 --> 30:49.494
<i>You know, I will
definitely look into that.</i>

30:49.529 --> 30:53.699
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.167
Okay?

30:57.370 --> 30:58.770
I told you to wait.

30:58.805 --> 31:00.772
I don't know how many
more ways I could say it.

31:00.807 --> 31:02.741
<i>Yeah, damn, I was waiting,</i>

31:02.775 --> 31:05.644
<i>and then that creepy,
quiet guy showed up.</i>

31:05.678 --> 31:07.479
Gus came by?

31:07.513 --> 31:08.914
Not him, man.

31:08.948 --> 31:11.016
Apparently I'm not worthy
of meeting him.

31:11.050 --> 31:13.952
It was the other one, the one
that I'm qualified to speak to.

31:13.986 --> 31:15.554
Then he started asking
questions, too,

31:15.588 --> 31:17.989
<i>like why
I haven't cooked anything.</i>

31:18.024 --> 31:19.591
<i>We have a quota.</i>

31:19.625 --> 31:21.660
It's due tomorrow.

31:21.694 --> 31:23.495
Do you seriously not care,
or what?

31:23.529 --> 31:26.732
<i>Because that guy, he's got,
like, the dead eyes.</i>

31:26.766 --> 31:28.133
Let me ask you something.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.969
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

31:31.003 --> 31:34.306
Oh, you mean when he put
a machinegun to my head?

31:34.340 --> 31:37.275
Yeah, I think that does ring
a tiny bell. Why?

31:37.310 --> 31:39.277
No. He kept-- He kept saying

31:39.312 --> 31:41.546
that-- that someone

31:41.581 --> 31:43.782
was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

31:43.816 --> 31:46.284
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

31:46.319 --> 31:48.120
<i>What the hell has
this even got to do with--</i>

31:48.154 --> 31:51.022
Look, I don't know.
It was, um--

31:51.057 --> 31:53.225
<i>uh...</i>

31:53.259 --> 31:55.994
His cousins.

31:56.028 --> 31:59.464
Right, Jesse?
It was his cousins.

31:59.499 --> 32:02.033
Yeah, cousins.

32:02.068 --> 32:03.735
Whatever, man. Why?

32:22.755 --> 32:24.489
Any news?

32:24.524 --> 32:25.957
[Marie] No change.

32:28.494 --> 32:31.897
Okay. Well, I--

32:31.931 --> 32:34.766
I didn't know whose
toothbrushes were whose, so I--

32:34.801 --> 32:37.869
I just stopped
by the drugstore.

32:37.904 --> 32:41.540
Thank God
for travel sizes, right?

32:42.775 --> 32:44.342
Thank you.
Yeah.

32:48.748 --> 32:51.049
Oh, I think I'm going
to go wash my face.

32:51.083 --> 32:54.586
I'm going crazy.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.188
Do you want to come?

32:56.222 --> 32:58.323
Yeah.

33:13.973 --> 33:15.674
I got candy bars.

33:17.243 --> 33:18.577
Oh, um--

33:20.012 --> 33:22.781
Is this what
you were asking for?

33:22.815 --> 33:24.983
Yeah.
Yeah?

33:25.017 --> 33:28.353
Yeah, I--
I skimmed through it.

33:28.387 --> 33:29.721
Looks interesting.

33:29.755 --> 33:30.922
Yeah.

33:30.957 --> 33:34.292
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

33:38.197 --> 33:39.831
What's it about?

33:42.034 --> 33:44.402
Pablo Escobar,

33:44.437 --> 33:46.905
this big drug guy in the '80s.

33:48.207 --> 33:51.142
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
seeing him on the news.

33:51.177 --> 33:56.314
Well, it's more about
the guys who investigated him

33:56.349 --> 33:59.017
and tried to bring him down.

33:59.051 --> 34:02.120
Some of them were DEA,
you know?

34:02.154 --> 34:07.559
Uncle Hank said that they
were worth learning about,

34:07.593 --> 34:10.862
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

34:10.897 --> 34:13.831
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

34:16.168 --> 34:18.303
I guess I never thought
about it.

34:20.438 --> 34:21.606
[chuckles]

34:21.641 --> 34:25.476
He said that good guys

34:25.511 --> 34:27.779
never get ink
like the bad guys do.

34:35.154 --> 34:36.855
[chuckles]

34:36.889 --> 34:39.824
So he gave it to me.

34:39.859 --> 34:41.826
Figured I'd read it.

34:45.164 --> 34:46.731
[cell phone ringing]

34:56.242 --> 34:58.810
Uh, I-- I need to--

34:58.844 --> 35:00.779
I'll be right back, okay?

35:07.386 --> 35:10.155
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

35:10.189 --> 35:12.357
Absolutely.

35:12.391 --> 35:16.428
<i>[Gus] So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

35:16.462 --> 35:18.763
Well, uh--

35:18.798 --> 35:20.532
No. Unfortunately--

35:20.566 --> 35:24.336
<i>Unfortunately,
we're not going to be able</i>

35:24.370 --> 35:26.571
to keep our schedule this week.

35:26.605 --> 35:29.107
But not for lack of trying.

35:29.141 --> 35:31.242
Is there something
I should know?

35:31.277 --> 35:36.214
Well, to be completely
honest with you...

35:36.248 --> 35:38.783
Gale really screwed us up.

35:38.818 --> 35:40.652
I mean, not on purpose,
of course,

35:40.686 --> 35:42.988
but he just--
he set us way back,

35:43.022 --> 35:47.025
and we've been playing
catch-up ever since.

35:47.059 --> 35:51.062
<i>And I've had to be out
running errands</i>

35:51.097 --> 35:53.898
<i>and trying to keep us
on target.</i>

35:53.933 --> 35:56.634
Some of the equipment

35:56.669 --> 35:58.403
wasn't calibrated
correctly and--

35:58.437 --> 36:01.639
Well, it's just all
very technical and boring,

36:01.674 --> 36:04.876
but rest assured that--

36:04.910 --> 36:07.245
that we will
do whatever it takes.

36:07.279 --> 36:09.848
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

36:09.882 --> 36:12.083
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

36:12.118 --> 36:16.454
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.560
I have your word on that?

36:22.595 --> 36:23.895
You do.

36:23.929 --> 36:27.565
You have my word on that.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.134
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

36:56.562 --> 36:58.229
Any news?

36:58.264 --> 37:02.167
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

37:02.201 --> 37:04.202
How's everybody doing?

37:04.236 --> 37:07.872
Well, as well
as can be expected.

37:07.907 --> 37:11.142
It's this not knowing

37:11.177 --> 37:13.044
that's the hardest part,
I think.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.582
Anything new on these guys?

37:17.616 --> 37:19.617
Who they are?
What they wanted?

37:19.652 --> 37:21.786
No, nothing yet,

37:21.821 --> 37:23.788
but we'll get it.

37:27.693 --> 37:29.160
Steve...

37:31.430 --> 37:33.364
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

37:35.568 --> 37:38.570
Buddy, nobody's getting
to Hank.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.005
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.874
So, no.

37:44.376 --> 37:46.377
No way.

37:47.513 --> 37:48.880
Jesus.

37:48.914 --> 37:50.615
I'd love to walk in there

37:50.649 --> 37:52.617
and shoot that bastard
right in the head.

37:52.651 --> 37:54.052
Me, too.

37:59.358 --> 38:00.725
[cell phone rings]

38:02.361 --> 38:03.661
Yeah.

38:04.897 --> 38:06.264
Oh, yeah?

38:06.298 --> 38:09.000
Great. We'll be right down.

38:09.034 --> 38:10.635
Food's here.

38:10.669 --> 38:12.470
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

38:15.674 --> 38:17.408
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

38:17.443 --> 38:19.310
Owner's a big booster
for the DEA.

38:19.345 --> 38:22.580
He heard what happened.
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

38:24.016 --> 38:25.783
That's-- That's wonderful.

38:25.818 --> 38:28.553
Yeah, and apparently he's
bringing it by personally.

38:32.024 --> 38:33.391
[elevator bell dings]

38:36.109 --> 38:37.810
[Marie] I don't even
know what to say.

38:37.844 --> 38:38.877
[Skyler]
That's an incredible--

38:38.912 --> 38:40.179
Good, huh?

38:40.213 --> 38:41.647
Delicious.

38:41.681 --> 38:44.850
[Marie] That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

38:44.884 --> 38:46.351
[Skyler] Yes, thank you.

38:46.386 --> 38:47.519
Guys, did you hear that?

38:47.554 --> 38:50.222
Mr. Fring is offering
a $10,000 reward

38:50.256 --> 38:52.224
on any information
about the case.

38:52.258 --> 38:55.828
Well, that's--
that's wonderful.

38:55.862 --> 38:58.397
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

38:58.431 --> 39:00.232
You're very welcome.

39:00.266 --> 39:02.301
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

39:02.335 --> 39:04.436
between us and these animals.

39:04.471 --> 39:06.572
I only wish I could do more.

39:11.411 --> 39:13.645
Well, we do appreciate
your support.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.181
This reward could turn
the tide here.

39:16.216 --> 39:18.884
It'll really help.

39:18.918 --> 39:22.354
Again, I can't express
how sorry I am.

39:22.388 --> 39:24.656
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

39:24.691 --> 39:26.792
[Marie] Really?

39:26.826 --> 39:30.028
Our fun run,
a couple months ago.

39:30.063 --> 39:33.432
Mr. Fring
was one of our sponsors.

39:33.466 --> 39:37.269
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

39:37.303 --> 39:41.006
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.778
Really? Huh.

39:46.813 --> 39:50.315
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

39:50.350 --> 39:53.151
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

39:53.186 --> 39:55.621
I hope that there's been
good news.

39:57.457 --> 40:01.493
Uh, yeah, things
have improved, yes.

40:01.528 --> 40:03.795
That's wonderful to hear.

40:03.830 --> 40:07.366
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

40:09.469 --> 40:13.572
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

40:13.606 --> 40:17.976
Um... thank you
again very much.

40:18.011 --> 40:19.478
It was a great pleasure
to meet you.

40:19.512 --> 40:21.647
Thank you. 
[Walter, Jr.] Yes, thank you.

40:23.816 --> 40:26.084
Let me walk you out.
Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

40:32.759 --> 40:36.028
You know,
I didn't say thank you.

40:36.062 --> 40:37.162
I'll walk him out.

40:37.196 --> 40:38.664
I'll be right back.

40:40.333 --> 40:43.635
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

40:45.338 --> 40:47.339
Good. Good-- Hey.

40:47.373 --> 40:49.608
Oh, you're very welcome.
My pleasure.

40:49.642 --> 40:51.243
My pleasure, yeah.
Excuse me.

40:51.277 --> 40:52.844
Thank you. Thank you.

40:52.879 --> 40:54.413
It's good chicken, huh?
Yeah.

40:54.447 --> 40:55.714
Good.
Mr. Fring.

40:55.748 --> 40:57.282
May I--
Mr. White.

40:57.317 --> 40:59.084
I just wanted
to thank you again.

40:59.118 --> 41:00.586
Oh, it's my pleasure.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.955
Uh, may I--
may I speak with you?

41:02.989 --> 41:04.323
Just a moment?

41:09.028 --> 41:11.129
You knew.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.699
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

41:15.068 --> 41:18.070
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

41:18.104 --> 41:20.939
What careful man wouldn't?

41:20.974 --> 41:23.875
He is not a problem for us,

41:23.910 --> 41:25.944
for our business.

41:29.115 --> 41:32.150
Your being here is--

41:32.185 --> 41:35.754
Is this some sort of message?

41:35.788 --> 41:38.156
I'm supporting my community.

I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

No-- No, listen, I--

This attack
on my brother-in-law--

41:44.664 --> 41:46.765
I don't--
I don't understand it.

41:46.799 --> 41:48.667
I don't know what it means.

41:48.701 --> 41:52.938
Please, if you have
some knowledge

41:52.972 --> 41:54.506
that you could share with me.

42:00.046 --> 42:02.648
I fear for my family.

I'm sure they'll be fine.

I am told the assassin
that survived

42:06.386 --> 42:07.853
is gravely injured.

42:07.887 --> 42:09.655
It's doubtful he'll live.

42:13.259 --> 42:15.594
Now thank me and shake my hand.

42:19.565 --> 42:22.501
Uh-- thank you.
Thank you again.

42:22.535 --> 42:24.536
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

42:35.214 --> 42:38.216

43:38.177 --> 43:41.046
Your man died.
I heard.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.180
It's unfortunate.

43:42.215 --> 43:43.548
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate,"</i>

43:43.583 --> 43:46.618
<i>and meanwhile I have Federales
surrounding my house.</i>

43:46.652 --> 43:48.954
You know what I think, Gustavo?

43:48.988 --> 43:50.455
I think you're behind all this.

43:50.490 --> 43:54.259
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

43:54.293 --> 43:56.228
<i>That's the part I'm trying
to figure out.</i>

43:56.262 --> 43:59.364
Go off on your own, maybe.

43:59.398 --> 44:00.966
Would you actually think
that would work?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.035
<i>Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

44:04.070 --> 44:05.403
<i>Maybe you should call me back</i>

44:05.438 --> 44:06.872
when you're seeing things
more clearly.

44:06.906 --> 44:08.740
I see things clear enough.

44:08.775 --> 44:12.444
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

44:12.478 --> 44:14.646
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

44:14.680 --> 44:17.649
<i>and I wind up with Federales
in my rose bushes.</i>

44:17.683 --> 44:19.451
<i>But just for a while.</i>

44:19.485 --> 44:23.922
Appearances, politics.

44:23.956 --> 44:25.991
<i>Are you still there,
Gustavo?</i>

44:26.025 --> 44:29.127
Yes, I'm here.

44:29.162 --> 44:31.830
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

44:31.864 --> 44:33.732
My brother's a police chief.

44:33.766 --> 44:36.334
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

44:36.369 --> 44:38.770
And when I get proof

44:38.805 --> 44:42.174
and the others find out
what you've done,

44:42.208 --> 44:45.043
maybe we come pay you a visit.

44:45.077 --> 44:47.345
<i>Maybe we c--

44:47.380 --> 44:48.613
<i>[speaks Spanish]</i>

44:48.648 --> 44:49.981
[Men shouting]

44:50.016 --> 44:51.249
[speaks Spanish]

44:51.284 --> 44:52.818
[shouts in Spanish]

44:52.852 --> 44:54.753
[gunfire]

44:54.787 --> 44:56.688
[speaks Spanish]

44:56.722 --> 44:58.056
[glass shatters]

45:02.428 --> 45:03.762
<i>[gunfire]</i>

45:06.199 --> 45:07.999
<i>[gunfire]</i>

45:34.660 --> 45:36.061
Skyler. Skyler.

45:36.095 --> 45:37.863
Marie. Marie.

45:39.398 --> 45:41.967
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

45:42.001 --> 45:44.970
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

45:45.004 --> 45:47.739
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediately family only.

45:47.773 --> 45:49.007
We're all family.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.308
I understand,

45:50.343 --> 45:52.644
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need--

45:52.678 --> 45:55.280
We're all family.

46:02.021 --> 46:07.325
