Troy, I brought with me

<i>Riviera:
Yes, but unfortunately,
a century of neglect</i>

into a depressing eyesore.</i>

02:10.460 --> 02:12.330
So what? I guess we're
gonna have to throw it away.

02:12.390 --> 02:13.660
Not so fast, Troy.

Homer, could you

07:06.690 --> 07:08.990
There's a little test
I want you to take.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.430

Oh, great.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.890
You made me miss Joe Theisman.

This is from the National
Fatherhood Institute.

07:16.230 --> 07:19.300
It evaluates your knowledge
of your son and rates you as a
father.

07:19.370 --> 07:20.610
Oh, Marge.

07:20.670 --> 07:21.810
Question one:

"Name one of
your child's friends."

Uh, let's see...Bart's friends..

in his pockets.

07:32.010 --> 07:34.080
They want a name, Homer
not a vague description.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.920
Okay... Hank?

Hank? Hank who?

Hank... Jones.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.460
Homer, you made that up.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.450
Question two:

07:41.520 --> 07:43.280
"Who is your son's hero?"

07:43.360 --> 07:44.530
Steve McQueen.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.090
That's <i>your hero.</i>

07:46.160 --> 07:47.370
"Name another Dad

Next.

07:49.230 --> 07:51.040
"What are your son's hobbies?"

07:51.100 --> 07:52.770
Well, he's always chewing on
that phone cord.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.160
He hasn't done that
since he was two.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.740
Then he <i>has no hobbies.</i>

09:56.120 --> 09:57.790
How's your research coming, Son?

09:57.860 --> 10:00.000
I think we're near
a breakthrough.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.330
Good work.
Thanks, Dad.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.900
Oh, how I envy you.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.930
Homer, that
easy back and forther
you witnessed

10:05.000 --> 10:06.540
didn't happen overnight.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.740
It took years
of effort.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.930
I've never been afraid
of a little hard work.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.680
That's the spirit.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.110
Step one--
find an activity
the two of you can share.

10:15.180 --> 10:15.980
Does the boy
have any interests?

10:16.040 --> 10:16.700
What boy?

10:16.780 --> 10:18.080
Your son.

10:18.150 --> 10:21.050
Find something he likes to do
and share in it.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.890
Well, he <i>is building
a Soap Box Derby racer!</i>

10:23.950 --> 10:26.590
Oh, that would be perfect.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.430
Dear God! Not again!

10:29.490 --> 10:32.460
Bart, I'm going to help you
build that racer.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.500
Thanks,
but I'm almost done.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.220
Why don't you get back
on the couch and watch TV.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.230
Okay.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.370
No! I'm going to do it.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.760
Sorry Dad.
But three-time Soap Box
Derby champion Ronnie Beck

10:42.840 --> 10:43.940
never needed
his Dad's help.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.810
But you can use me.
I'm good.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.670
I built a lot of things
around the house:

10:47.740 --> 10:49.340
the spice rack...

10:51.480 --> 10:52.950
the bird feeder...

10:54.120 --> 10:55.720
the Gymboree.

10:58.790 --> 10:59.620
What was that?

10:59.690 --> 11:00.730
Ah, who cares?

11:00.790 --> 11:01.890
Son, please let me
help you.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.060
Come on, Dad.
It would be weird.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.920
This isn't working at all.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.120
It's hopeless.

11:06.190 --> 11:10.620
Wait a second.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.070
Hmm.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.960
"Cosby's First Law
of Intergenerational Perversity.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.840
"No matter what you tell
your child to do

11:17.910 --> 11:19.740
he will always do
the opposite."

11:19.810 --> 11:20.780
Huh?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.170
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

11:22.240 --> 11:23.940
<i>You gotta use
reverse psychology.</i>

11:24.010 --> 11:25.620
That sounds too complicated.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.320
<i>Okay, don't use
reverse psychology.</i>

11:27.380 --> 11:29.350
All right, I will.

11:29.420 --> 11:32.360
Son, I don't think
you should let me help you.

11:32.420 --> 11:35.290
If you really want to help,
you can clean these paint
brushes.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.830
Thank you, Bill Cosby.

11:36.890 --> 11:38.800

You know, Marge,
that Bart of ours
is a little miracle--

12:10.030 --> 12:12.030
his winning smile,
his button nose

12:12.090 --> 12:13.590
his fat, little stomach.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.170
His face alight
with wholesome mischief.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.940
He reminds me of me

12:18.000 --> 12:20.570
before the weight of the world
crushed my spirit.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.670
Hmm, yeah.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.340
( <i>trumpet fanfare )</i>

12:29.680 --> 12:31.720
I like our chances, Son.

12:31.780 --> 12:34.320
Ugh! Your father's
not supposed to
help build your racer,

12:34.380 --> 12:36.180
but you should at least
consult him about it.

12:36.250 --> 12:36.890
D-oh!!

12:36.950 --> 12:38.160
You're in heat four.

12:38.220 --> 12:39.320
Woah, where's
your helmet, son?

12:39.390 --> 12:40.930
Helmets are for wusses, Sir.

12:40.990 --> 12:43.460
No, I don't think
I can let you go
without a safety helmet.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.260
This is my son, and if he
doesn't want to wear one

12:46.330 --> 12:47.400
<i>you can't make him.</i>

12:47.460 --> 12:48.570
Okay, fine.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.300
I want to get out
of here sometime today.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.770
Attention, everyone.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.100
I say to those who question
the value of the space program..

12:55.170 --> 12:56.110
behold!

12:59.440 --> 13:00.780
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

13:02.280 --> 13:04.350
Hey, you're not supposed
to smoke in the pit area.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.440
Fine.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.190
Hey, Simpson

13:08.250 --> 13:09.750
where's your losermobile?

13:09.820 --> 13:11.660
( <i>laughing: )
Losermobile.</i>

13:11.720 --> 13:12.620
Wait a minute.

13:12.690 --> 13:16.190
Uh, it's over there, Nelson.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.660
Whoa, talk about
your pieces of crap.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.460
You know Bart,
I don't care who wins

13:20.530 --> 13:22.430
as long as one of us
beats that guy.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.800
Same here.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.500
Careful boys, it took me months
to steal that bumper.

13:27.570 --> 13:28.810
Boy:
<i>Help! Help!</i>

13:28.870 --> 13:29.640
What was that?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.070
You didn't hear nothing!

13:31.140 --> 13:33.210
Are you nervous, Son?

13:33.270 --> 13:36.470
Don't worry, Dad. As three-time
Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie
Beck says:

13:36.540 --> 13:38.710
"Gravity is my co-pilot."

13:38.780 --> 13:41.620
Hey Boss.
Just in case
you need it.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.880
Aw, thanks guys.

13:45.690 --> 13:46.960
Now get outta here!

13:47.020 --> 13:50.590
Oh, I didn't realize
this hill was so high.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.230
Could I have another..?

14:21.990 --> 14:23.860

It hurts! It hurts!

14:29.330 --> 14:30.870
Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow!

14:30.930 --> 14:32.190
Mm-hmm.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.800
Young man, I'm afraid
this stress fracture

14:33.870 --> 14:37.370
will require you
to be in a cast for six weeks.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.680
But that means
I can't possibly race.

14:39.740 --> 14:40.980
Son, you're lucky
to be alive.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.640
Save your palliative clichés

14:42.710 --> 14:44.720
for the next poor sap,
doctor.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.480
Is it okay to visit?

14:46.550 --> 14:47.950
( <i>chuckling: )
Of course.</i>

14:48.020 --> 14:49.890
Hey, man, cool crash.

14:49.950 --> 14:52.290
- Way to cheat death.
- Thanks, Bart.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.320
You had the best stick
out there, man.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.290
I wish I could
build 'em like you..

14:56.360 --> 14:59.560
That racer transformed me
into the twisted creature

14:59.630 --> 15:01.170
you see before you.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.370
I'll never race again.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.470
If you don't race,
then Nelson will win.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.860
Even if I wanted to,
I'm in no shape to do it.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.510
Unless...

15:10.570 --> 15:13.280
Bart, will <i>you
drive my car?</i>

15:13.340 --> 15:15.010
I don't know
if I should do that.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.010
My Dad and I built
our car together,

15:17.080 --> 15:19.850
and if I drove someone else's,
it would kill him.

15:19.910 --> 15:22.040
On the other hand, I'll do it.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.060
Okay Bart. We've got
a lot of work to do
on the car.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.360
So I'm gonna pull you
out of school for the
next couple of weeks...

15:27.420 --> 15:29.890
Dad, I don't know
how to say this, but

15:29.960 --> 15:31.400
I don't want to drive your car.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.200
It's slow, it's ugly.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.370
It handles
like a shopping cart.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.330
Bart, the car
has a few bugs in
it, I admit that,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.240
but we're Team Simpson.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.740
Dad, I love you,
but you taught me to win.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
When did I ever
teach you that?

15:43.870 --> 15:45.440
Well, I picked it up somewhere.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.310
If I drive Martin's car,
I <i>can win.</i>

15:47.380 --> 15:48.850
I'm sorry, but...

15:48.910 --> 15:50.680
Go ahead, leave me.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.680
Dad...

15:51.750 --> 15:53.020
Go on and win.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.690
Win without your Dad.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.650
I'll just sit here
in <i>Li'l Lightnin'</i>

15:57.720 --> 15:59.290
which the Simpsons built

15:59.350 --> 16:01.780
and remember that
for one brief shining moment

16:01.860 --> 16:03.660
I had a son.

16:08.430 --> 16:09.430
Ow.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.370
Ohh!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.640
Dad. Can you take me
to Dr. Hibbert's office?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.000
Why? What's wrong?

16:18.070 --> 16:19.630
Oh nothing. I just
scheduled a tetanus booster.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.580
Maybe I'm being
a little anal

16:21.640 --> 16:23.370
but barefoot season's coming up

16:23.440 --> 16:25.610
and there's a world
of rusty nails out there.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.020
Oh sure, I'll take you

16:27.080 --> 16:28.690
wait with you,
worry about you

16:28.750 --> 16:31.360
and then you'll ride home
with someone who has
a faster car.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.760
This is how you get your kicks,
isn't it, Lisa?

16:37.090 --> 16:37.660
D-ohhh!

16:40.560 --> 16:42.730
Martin, your bone
is healing nicely.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.500
Tell me something
I don't know.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.840
( <i>chuckles )</i>

16:45.900 --> 16:47.440
Dr. Hibbert,
Lisa needs a...

16:47.500 --> 16:48.610
You!

16:48.670 --> 16:50.170
Home wrecker!

16:50.240 --> 16:53.710
Mr. Simpson, you have every
right to be angry.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.310
But rest assured,
your son loves you.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.710
( <i>growls )
( <i>screams )</i></i>

16:57.780 --> 16:59.020
( <i>Hibbert laughs )</i>

16:59.080 --> 17:01.850
You certainly gave that boy
the heebie-jeebies.

17:09.020 --> 17:09.980
Dad, aren't
you coming?

17:10.060 --> 17:10.730
No.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.060
Now, don't pout.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.760
I'm not pouting. You are.

17:13.829 --> 17:15.030
Dad, you gotta come.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.730
I just got your hat
out of the fridge.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.170
Sorry.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.329
Don't you at least
have something to say to Bart?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.740
Homer:
<i>No. Can't think
of a thing.</i>

17:22.800 --> 17:25.730
Homer, I've always said
you were a good father.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.880
I've always defended you
when people put you down.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.140
- That's for sure.
- She ain't lyin'.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.010
But I guess I was wrong.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.090
You <i>are a bad father.</i>

17:35.150 --> 17:36.220
Leave me alone.

17:40.490 --> 17:41.830
( <i>fanfare playing )</i>

17:41.890 --> 17:44.500
TV Announcer:
Good morning, everybody

17:44.560 --> 17:46.700
and welcome to an event
that harkens back

17:46.760 --> 17:49.070
to the carefree days
of the great depression--

17:49.130 --> 17:50.600
The Soap Box Derby.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.700
In just minutes

17:52.770 --> 17:55.540
these junior Al Unser, Jrs.
will lock horns.

17:57.040 --> 17:57.770
Huh?

17:57.840 --> 18:00.210
"Name your son's hobbies."

18:00.270 --> 18:02.340
Building a soap box racer.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.450
"Name one
of your child's friends."

18:04.510 --> 18:05.410
Martin.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.750
Martin!

18:06.810 --> 18:09.310
I'll curse that name
till the day I die!

18:09.380 --> 18:10.980
Huh?

18:11.050 --> 18:13.290
"Who is your son's hero?"

18:13.350 --> 18:16.450
Three-time Soap Box Derby
champion, Ronnie Beck.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.990
Wow. I'm one question away
from being a perfect father.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.900
"Name another Dad
you talk to about parenting."

18:22.960 --> 18:23.960
Ohh!

18:24.030 --> 18:25.040
Hey-hey-ho,
Simpson.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.240
Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders!

18:27.300 --> 18:28.240
Flanders!

18:28.300 --> 18:29.660
Flanders, uh... uh...

18:29.740 --> 18:32.880
When should a boy
start dating?

18:32.940 --> 18:34.750
Well sir, there are two schools
of thought on the subject...

18:34.810 --> 18:35.910
Great! Thanks.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.780
I talked to Flanders
about parenting!

18:37.850 --> 18:40.020
I'm a perfect father!

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
Hold on, Son.

18:41.150 --> 18:42.320
I'm a coming.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.890
My friend and I
have a bet.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.090
Are you Mary Tyler Moore?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.260
( <i>screaming )</i>

18:52.330 --> 18:53.700
( <i>belches )</i>

18:53.760 --> 18:55.470
Ooh! Wow!
It really is you.

18:57.030 --> 18:59.600
Bart, if she breaks up on you,
steer away from the grandstands

18:59.670 --> 19:02.540
or else you might kill hundreds
of innocent spectators.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.300
Bart, what did I
just tell you?

19:04.370 --> 19:05.710
Kill spectators.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.850
What is the matter
with you?

19:08.910 --> 19:11.110
It's my Dad--
lying there on the couch

19:11.180 --> 19:13.120
drinking a beer,
staring at the TV.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.120
I've never seen him
like that.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.810
Forget about
your father!

19:16.880 --> 19:18.310
You're driving
for me now.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.560
Do it for your old man, boy.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.770
Simpson,
prepare to die.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.240
Let's rock.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.700
Emcee:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:32.770 --> 19:35.570
<i>to drop the green flag--
our beloved mayor</i>

19:35.640 --> 19:37.570
Diamond Joe Quimby.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.140
To everyone participating today,
I salute your vigor.

19:41.210 --> 19:44.010
Check out the rack on the blonde
in the fourth row.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.490
( <i>crowd cheering )</i>

19:49.550 --> 19:52.290
Marge:
Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:54.060 --> 19:55.630
Ha! Ha!

19:55.690 --> 19:57.290
Announcer:
<i>Like the elegant Roman
in Judah Ben Hur</i>

19:57.360 --> 19:59.460
<i>these modern charioteers
battle ferociously.</i>

19:59.530 --> 20:01.870
<i>No quarter given; none asked.</i>

20:15.910 --> 20:18.620
( <i>camera clicking )</i>

20:23.450 --> 20:25.320
<i>The world has not seen
the likes of this</i>

20:25.390 --> 20:27.090
<i>since the French
carried Lucky Lindy off</i>

20:27.160 --> 20:29.430
<i>on their shoulders,
from Le Bourget Field.</i>

20:29.490 --> 20:31.060
Emcee:
<i>And now, to present the trophy</i>

20:31.130 --> 20:34.230
three-time Soap Box Derby
champion, Ronnie Beck.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.270
Congratulations, Bart.

20:39.330 --> 20:42.200
Seeing you out there
brought back a lot of memories.

20:42.270 --> 20:43.540
Thanks, Mr. Beck.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.430
I was alone out there

20:45.510 --> 20:47.940
but someone was riding
with me in spirit.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.780
This is for <i>you, Dad.</i>

20:49.840 --> 20:51.540
No, son,
you earned it.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.940
I might remind you both
I <i>did design that racer.</i>

20:55.020 --> 20:56.950
The driver
is essentially ballast.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.890
The better man won, Simpson.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.630
You can really drive.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.630
Thanks, Nelson.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.760
