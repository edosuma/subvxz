01:03.411 --> 01:06.718
As I
pondered in silence,

01:06.805 --> 01:16.337
returning upon my poems,
considering, lingering long,

01:16.424 --> 01:26.042
a phantom arose before me
with distrustful aspect,

01:26.129 --> 01:30.177
in beauty, age--

01:31.961 --> 01:33.005
--and power.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.055
Looks like the
guy is a squatter.

01:39.142 --> 01:39.925
Bathroom is locked.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.666
No key.

01:41.753 --> 01:42.754
Unarmed?

01:42.841 --> 01:43.841
Seems likely.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.290
Clear.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.751
Police.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.144
Open the door.

02:24.231 --> 02:27.016
Come out slowly,
with your hands up.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.235
Open the door.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.107
Buddy, you can't stay in there.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.848
- I
- should be telling

02:32.935 --> 02:34.937
this with a sigh, somewhere
ages and ages hence.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.113
If you
don't open the door, sir,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.680
I'm going to have
to break it down.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.834
Two roads
diverged in a wood.

02:42.858 --> 02:43.965
Let
me find me something

02:43.989 --> 02:45.774
to knock this door down.

02:45.861 --> 02:49.212
And I, I took
the one less traveled by.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.083
And that has made
all the difference.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.844
You're going
to have to open the door.

02:57.046 --> 02:57.742
Go.

02:57.829 --> 02:58.829
Go, go, go.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.359
Contact right!

03:11.539 --> 03:12.907
Disturb
us, Lord, when

03:12.931 --> 03:16.108
we are too well
pleased with ourselves,

03:16.196 --> 03:20.635
when our dreams have come
true, because we have dreamed

03:20.722 --> 03:25.770
too little, when we
arrive safely because we

03:25.857 --> 03:29.209
sailed too close to the shore.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.168
Do you see that
guy loading his RPG?

03:32.255 --> 03:33.387
Got him.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.350
I'm going in!

03:40.437 --> 03:41.437
FRAG out

04:05.419 --> 04:06.507
Is he dead?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.030
West side target building.

04:08.117 --> 04:08.857
Goddamn!

04:08.944 --> 04:09.684
Morley's dead!

04:09.771 --> 04:10.772
Ghost!

04:10.859 --> 04:12.861
Get in the fucking fight.

04:12.948 --> 04:13.948
Tally

04:17.822 --> 04:18.822
Cover!

04:22.130 --> 04:23.219
Shit!

04:23.306 --> 04:24.220
God!

04:24.307 --> 04:25.177
God, it was too fucking

04:25.265 --> 04:25.917
close.

04:26.004 --> 04:26.657
You good?

04:26.744 --> 04:27.397
I'm good.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.137
I'm good.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.051
I owe you.

04:29.138 --> 04:29.834
You owe me shit.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.053
Hey, Sammy.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.140
Listen.

04:33.969 --> 04:34.969
Listen, listen.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.887
Are we clear?

04:38.974 --> 04:39.974
Clear.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.076
Let's move.

04:54.163 --> 04:54.685
Hey!

04:54.772 --> 04:55.599
Hey!

04:55.686 --> 04:56.252
You fucking crazy?

04:56.339 --> 04:57.384
What?

04:57.471 --> 04:58.167
They got him turned around, man.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.081
No, Ghost.

04:59.168 --> 04:59.864
We wait here, man.

04:59.951 --> 05:00.604
They baitin' us.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.171
What are you doing?

05:02.258 --> 05:03.409
I'm going to loan you a
pair of men's underwear.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.129
You stain them, you own them.

05:04.216 --> 05:04.782
You keep them.

05:04.869 --> 05:05.348
Yeah.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.001
Let me know.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.481
Braden

05:12.007 --> 05:12.877
I got it.

05:12.964 --> 05:13.661
I've got it, Ghost.

05:13.748 --> 05:14.748
I've got it.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.098
There you go.

05:16.185 --> 05:16.925
Bring it.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.012
There you go.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.974
This is the the last
motherfucker I'd thought I'd be

05:23.061 --> 05:26.413
slung over my shoulder.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.110
I said I'm not
feeling it, Ghost.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.112
Well, you can tell
everybody you led the way.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.243
I'm the First Sergeant.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.438
I say we stay the fuck here.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.158
Atta boy.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.116
Stack up!

05:34.203 --> 05:35.203
Why?

05:37.467 --> 05:40.078
You're an ass.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.165
On three!

05:44.344 --> 05:45.344
Three!

05:47.085 --> 05:48.085
God!

05:51.873 --> 05:53.570
Fuck!

05:53.657 --> 05:55.180
Motherfuckers!

05:59.228 --> 05:59.924
Hey!

06:00.011 --> 06:01.011
Let me go!

06:03.232 --> 06:04.232
Put the cuffs.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.020
Get him up.

06:11.849 --> 06:12.849
Walk!

06:14.461 --> 06:15.375
No!

06:15.462 --> 06:16.376
No!

06:16.463 --> 06:17.986
Don't do this!

06:18.073 --> 06:19.379
Don't do this!

06:19.466 --> 06:20.989
I need a medic!

06:21.076 --> 06:24.384
I need a medic!

06:24.471 --> 06:25.907
Believe this guy?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.082
Something else.

06:30.477 --> 06:34.176
All right, buddy.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.873
Let's see.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.745
You've got anything
shoved in your pockets?

06:37.832 --> 06:39.050
Anything going to prick me?

06:40.356 --> 06:41.749
As
to me, directing

06:41.836 --> 06:46.841
like flame, its eyes
with finger pointing

06:46.928 --> 06:49.147
to many immortal songs.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
Take a break.

06:51.236 --> 06:58.200
A menacing voice,
what singest thou, it said.

06:58.287 --> 07:03.118
Knowest thou not there is but
one theme forever enduring

07:03.205 --> 07:04.946
bards.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.689
And that is the theme of war.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.995
The fortune of battles.

07:11.082 --> 07:15.609
The making of perfect soldiers.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.708
Hey, Tony!

07:27.795 --> 07:29.274
What you doing?

07:29.361 --> 07:30.450
Let me get that for you.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.537
He's got it.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.587
Looks like they knew you

07:37.674 --> 07:38.674
That's funny.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.636
Who tagged it?

07:42.723 --> 07:44.551
I don't know.

07:44.638 --> 07:48.642
Locals, gang bangers, who knows?

07:48.729 --> 07:50.252
Who's the kid?

07:50.339 --> 07:51.339
He's Pete.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.432
You got any paying work?

07:56.519 --> 07:57.825
No.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.218
And none coming down
the line either.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.178
Sorry about that, bud.

08:03.265 --> 08:06.137
You said Venice
Boulevard moved out.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.575
Extended their lease.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.578
How about that
building you just bought?

08:11.665 --> 08:12.665
It's in escrow.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.279
All right.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.587
Did you get a new bike?

08:20.674 --> 08:22.502
Yeah.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.287
You mind if we settle up on
the last little bit of work?

08:25.374 --> 08:29.465
Pete, take five.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.946
You want to settle up?

08:32.033 --> 08:33.513
Of course.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.472
Come here.

08:36.558 --> 08:48.963
There you go.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.792
Actually it comes
to a whole lot more.

08:51.879 --> 08:52.619
That's it.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.534
We're settled.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.623
I'm not clear.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.581
You're not clear.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.104
OK.

09:00.191 --> 09:03.151
Well, you want me to
explain it to you?

09:03.238 --> 09:04.892
You spent the two
weeks that you were

09:04.979 --> 09:07.459
meant to be working doing
pull ups off the side

09:07.547 --> 09:09.113
of that building in the alley.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.463
And I caught you
reading more than once.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.813
During my breaks.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.770
What breaks?

09:13.857 --> 09:14.684
What are you, union?

09:14.771 --> 09:16.251
There's no breaks.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.881
You're working four
to five hours a day.

09:17.905 --> 09:18.645
If it falls on your
lunch, that's fine.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.429
But there's no breaks.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.997
The VA docs says to exercise
to keep my heart rate up

09:23.084 --> 09:24.476
so I get oxygen to my brain.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.608
Yeah.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.567
I don't want to get into it.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.588
And they told me to read to
take my mind off other things.

09:29.612 --> 09:34.791
So can-- can you just pay me
the rest of what you owe me?

09:34.878 --> 09:41.015
Look, I'm going to make
this plain and simple for you.

09:41.102 --> 09:44.584
I am not paying you to get fit.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.368
OK?

09:46.455 --> 09:48.588
You want to fuck around,
there's plenty other assholes

09:48.675 --> 09:50.546
you can work for.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.027
Not like you.

09:53.114 --> 09:58.772
You're just like all
of them, looking for a handout.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.557
My injury's real, bro.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.038
Your injury's real?

10:04.125 --> 10:07.563
Then you should do
what your doctor said.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.740
He told you to read, bro?

10:10.827 --> 10:14.831
Then get a job as a librarian.

10:14.918 --> 10:15.789
You know what?

10:15.876 --> 10:17.747
You built the house.

10:17.834 --> 10:18.705
Own it.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.315
Pay me what you owe me.

10:21.185 --> 10:21.751
Now.

10:21.838 --> 10:22.838
Now?

10:39.029 --> 10:41.510
You enjoy living in a
country where you can mouth off

10:41.597 --> 10:44.426
to whoever, whenever?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.689
You're welcome.

10:46.776 --> 10:47.995
Thank you for that.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.300
Thank you for your service.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.436
Now get off my fucking premises.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.785
Walk away, Will.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.706
Pete, get back to it.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.451
You were the bigger man.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.539
Yeah, I mean it.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.540
You did the right thing.

11:11.627 --> 11:12.759
You walked away.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.631
I wanted to beat his ass.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.590
Understandable.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.940
Well, it's good
to know I still

11:20.027 --> 11:21.419
got a little fight left in me.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.769
I was ready to go, man.

11:22.856 --> 11:23.856
I bet.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.470
And he was a big
son-of-a-bitch.

11:28.557 --> 11:29.732
How big?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.386
6'4 or 6'5.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.169
6'5?

11:32.256 --> 11:32.822
Yeah?

11:32.909 --> 11:33.909
Ish.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.479
You know I ain't a lover.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.436
Yeah, I know.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.307
Hell no.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.308
Hell no.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.831
He was a bad ass.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.833
You know, Ghost, you
could cage fight.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.314
Well, you know I'm
younger than I look.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.097
Hey, come on, man.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.403
You look great.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.230
You mean that?

11:49.317 --> 11:50.535
I mean that.

11:50.622 --> 11:51.623
Fuck, yeah, I mean it.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.062
You could model, probably.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.368
Look at this face.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.719
You could model.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.155
Great way to meet girls.

12:05.246 --> 12:08.684
I bet this guy
meets a lot of girls.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.817
Hell, yeah, he does.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.166
All right.

12:12.253 --> 12:15.952
Now they say that
you ain't drunk

12:16.039 --> 12:20.652
if you can lay on the
ground without holding on.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.740
And who's "they"?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.786
The experts.

12:23.873 --> 12:24.787
OK.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.616
Let's see.

12:27.703 --> 12:28.443
Shit.

12:28.530 --> 12:29.530
I'm sober.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.403
All right.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.903
Hands down on the board
beside your shoulders.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.450
OK.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.819
Palms down, like you're
going to do a push-up.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.453
All right.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.847
And you thrust your
upper body up in the sky--

12:40.934 --> 12:42.587
You look like you're
fucking a crab hole.

12:42.674 --> 12:47.592
--and you sweep your
legs underneath you, and--

12:47.679 --> 12:50.465
I hope you can swim.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.032
Why?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.469
Because you ain't even
on the board, Ghost.

12:54.556 --> 12:55.556
Shit.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.255
Yeah.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.086
Hey.

13:03.173 --> 13:03.739
Give me a second.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.479
Hey.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.567
Hey, hey.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.917
Ghost, don't go over here.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.266
Now those are friends of mine.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.920
I see them down
here all the time.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.007
Ghost.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.446
What are you talking about?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.884
Why would you say that?

13:17.971 --> 13:20.234
Listen to me.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.539
You're not looking for him.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.589
So you leave him alone.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.676
I mean it.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.680
Ghost?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.092
You'll be all right.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.488
Wait!

13:57.575 --> 14:00.361
You-- you forgot--
you forgot your kiss!

14:00.448 --> 14:02.493
His lips must
be getting tired.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.626
I ain't going to
watch a soldier beg.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.409
Pisses me off.

14:05.496 --> 14:06.410
Let's pass him.

14:06.497 --> 14:09.631
Moving, on the right.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.111
Spare some change.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.895
A comedian.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.027
Aw, man!

14:14.114 --> 14:15.942
I'm just screwing with you.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.813
Yo, smile!

14:17.900 --> 14:20.163
It's a celebration.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.470
What we celebrating?

14:22.557 --> 14:24.602
That we're rich.

14:24.689 --> 14:29.303
Did not God choose the poor of
this world to be rich in faith,

14:29.390 --> 14:30.957
and heirs to the
kingdom which he

14:31.044 --> 14:33.829
promised to those who love him?

14:33.916 --> 14:34.830
The who and the what?

14:34.917 --> 14:36.005
The what?

14:36.092 --> 14:38.399
Are you military?

14:38.486 --> 14:39.356
'Nam.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.792
'71.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.490
Is that boonie
part of your uniform?

14:42.577 --> 14:43.621
Was.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.146
So what's all that crap on it?

14:46.233 --> 14:48.104
Shit I've collected.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.542
Well, can you clean it up
and show a little respect?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.805
You do that?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.807
What, you don't agree?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.374
This going to take long?

14:57.461 --> 14:58.656
I got a 2 o'clock
tee-time and 18 hole--

14:58.680 --> 14:59.986
Go ahead.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.393
Hey, is this thing
in park, Ghost?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.254
Bless you, brother.

15:12.520 --> 15:17.917
It enrages me and
it breaks my heart

15:18.004 --> 15:21.616
to see people that serve this
country standing on the streets

15:21.703 --> 15:22.703
begging for scraps.

15:22.747 --> 15:23.747
You with me?

15:30.712 --> 15:37.023
I know that you know
how to wear this.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.112
But just in case you forgot.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.117
You wear any piece
of this uniform,

15:44.204 --> 15:46.902
you stand tall proud, hooah?

15:46.989 --> 15:49.035
Hooah.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.472
You fought for this country.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.691
I did indeed.

15:53.778 --> 15:54.778
Remember that.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.784
You take care of yourself.

16:02.831 --> 16:03.919
Moving.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.006
Moving.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.802
Thanks, babe.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.979
How is it?

16:20.066 --> 16:22.111
Rocky fucking road.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.853
It's like Run DMC, shit
never gets old, man.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.141
Peter Piper picked
peppers, but Run rapped rhymes.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.688
Hey, read me this.

16:33.775 --> 16:34.689
No.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.560
For me.

16:36.647 --> 16:37.755
Come on, Ghost, can I just
sit and eat my ice cream?

16:37.779 --> 16:39.172
Come on.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.323
It'll take my mind
off the calories.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.088
I ain't your book bitch, man.

16:42.175 --> 16:45.308
No, but you could be.

16:45.395 --> 16:48.703
Why don't you just get a
book on tape or some shit?

16:48.790 --> 16:49.790
Dude.

16:51.749 --> 17:01.803
Today, across
our fathers graves,

17:01.890 --> 17:08.375
the astonished years reveal the
remnant of that desperate host

17:08.462 --> 17:12.814
which cleansed our
East with steel.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.493
Troop's had contact.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.824
Reinforce to Bravo checkpoint.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.696
I'm gonna pull off.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.061
God damn!

17:44.106 --> 17:45.151
Wait!

17:45.238 --> 17:48.632
Clarence Miller's been shot!

17:49.720 --> 17:50.634
Cover!

17:50.721 --> 17:51.721
They're moving left.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.986
Get him up against the tire.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.292
He's shot in the neck.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.424
My neck!

17:57.511 --> 18:00.557
Put pressure on that wound.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.298
Hail and farewell!

18:02.385 --> 18:04.996
We greet you here, with
tears that none will scorn--

18:05.084 --> 18:09.175
O keepers of the House of
old, or ever we were born!

18:09.262 --> 18:10.698
I want my money.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.110
What do you mean
you want your money?

18:12.134 --> 18:12.961
I told you to get
off my property!

18:13.048 --> 18:13.962
You owe me $145!

18:14.049 --> 18:14.615
Get off my property!

18:14.702 --> 18:15.529
I worked for you!

18:15.616 --> 18:16.878
You owe me money.

18:16.965 --> 18:17.879
I told you to get
off my premises.

18:17.966 --> 18:18.966
Now get out of here.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.317
That's assault!

18:21.404 --> 18:23.252
If you can
force your heart and nerve

18:23.276 --> 18:25.582
and sinew to serve your turn
long after they are gone,

18:25.669 --> 18:29.369
and so hold on when there is
nothing in you except the Will

18:29.456 --> 18:32.328
which says to them: "Hold on!"

18:32.415 --> 18:33.938
I am going to call the police.

18:34.025 --> 18:34.896
You rip
me off all the time.

18:34.983 --> 18:35.853
That is assault, Buddy.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.940
You're going to jail.

18:36.985 --> 18:37.899
I'm calling the police.

18:37.986 --> 18:42.077
That's assault. Police!

18:42.164 --> 18:43.426
You're going to jail!

18:43.513 --> 18:45.080
All right, move
your hand, brother.

18:45.167 --> 18:45.863
Let's go.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.604
Move, move.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.954
One
service more we dare to ask,

18:50.041 --> 18:51.913
pray for us heroes.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.090
Pray that when fate
lays on us our task,

18:55.177 --> 18:57.092
we do not shame the day.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.311
We got a vehicle inbound.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.674
It's not slowing.

19:13.761 --> 19:14.675
VBED!

19:14.762 --> 19:16.067
Light them up.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.029
Stay on them.

19:25.512 --> 19:31.431
Go, go, go, go, go, go

19:36.087 --> 19:37.393
Hey, asshole.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.394
We're even.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.004
Son of a bitch!

19:40.091 --> 19:41.091
Hey!

19:49.405 --> 19:50.405
Sorry.

19:50.885 --> 19:51.451
What?

19:51.538 --> 19:52.538
What?

19:54.802 --> 19:58.458
That is not the way you
answer the phone in this office.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.807
Really?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.088
Well, then get it
yourself nimrod.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.592
Nimrod?

20:02.679 --> 20:04.266
I don't know what's
happening to you lately,

20:04.290 --> 20:06.030
but you're becoming
completely unreliable.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.992
You know what?

20:11.079 --> 20:13.690
I quit.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.692
You quit.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.607
Um, yeah.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.609
I do.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.829
I quit.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.831
I quit.

20:23.918 --> 20:28.139
I'll be so sorry
to see you go.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.227
Sorry to see me go?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.142
No, no.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.493
You are not sorry to see me go.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.496
I work harder than a hound
dog at a flea convention,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.020
and you make me feel more
useless than a kickstarter

20:39.107 --> 20:40.891
on a commode.

20:40.978 --> 20:44.199
I ain't an asskisser, Mr.
Boss Man, and I sure as hell

20:44.286 --> 20:46.854
ain't about to take
any more this--

20:46.941 --> 20:48.029
this horse shit.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.773
Ladies.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.556
Gents.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.470
It's been real.

20:54.557 --> 20:55.950
Mary-Anne, wait.

20:56.037 --> 20:59.345
Emmers, you text me.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.347
Late!

21:01.434 --> 21:02.434
OK.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.899
Hell, yeah.

21:31.986 --> 21:32.986
Hell, yeah.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.993
My highway,
the yellow lines

23:06.080 --> 23:09.039
that disappeared
from time to time,

23:09.126 --> 23:13.348
and half wound up on the
wrong side of the road.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.354
My highway, I've
gone too fast, afraid

23:19.441 --> 23:24.620
that I might finish last,
I hugged a curve too hard,

23:24.707 --> 23:25.926
and lost control.

23:28.276 --> 23:33.847
I never know which
way it's going to go.

23:33.934 --> 23:38.112
But what a feeling,
chasing a sun

23:38.199 --> 23:41.202
and living my life
like a shot from a gun,

23:41.289 --> 23:47.469
laughing a little bit
more with every mouth.

23:47.556 --> 23:51.212
O what a freedom,
racing the wind,

23:51.299 --> 23:55.434
dying to know what's
around the next bend,

23:55.521 --> 24:00.221
smiling as I watch
the years roll by.

24:00.308 --> 24:07.924
I'm learning how to take it
day by day, on my highway.

24:11.232 --> 24:16.716
Yeah, yeah, what a freedom,
like sailing the wind,

24:16.803 --> 24:19.675
not looking back,
not forgetting where

24:19.762 --> 24:26.639
I been, smiling as I
watch the years roll back.

24:26.726 --> 24:32.427
And I'm moving on
from my mistakes.

24:32.514 --> 24:41.784
And I'm learning how to take
it day by day on my highway.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.747
Yeah.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.733
That's disgusting.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.039
Disgusting.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.010
What?

25:38.406 --> 25:39.406
Freak.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.375
Wait, how do I know that guy?

25:51.462 --> 25:52.812
İt's that actor.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.756
That it for you?

26:23.843 --> 26:26.280
This and a bottle
of Silver Coyote.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
You having a party?

26:37.726 --> 26:39.336
No.

26:39.423 --> 26:40.749
I sure hope you're not
drinking that and getting

26:40.773 --> 26:41.687
on that bike.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.080
Don't drink and ride.

26:44.167 --> 26:44.864
Cash?

26:44.951 --> 26:45.951
Charge.

26:48.781 --> 26:52.480
Reginald Anthony Millhouse.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.568
It's a family name.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.748
Robert, that's a good one.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.315
Don't hate me
cause you ain't me.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.152
Paper bag?

27:12.239 --> 27:13.239
Save a tree.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.331
Thank you.

33:37.232 --> 33:40.366
I wrote this sitting
on a tarmac in Iraq,

33:40.453 --> 33:43.499
for Private Woody Farnsworth,
waiting on a bird.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.458
I mean that ain't the
name of the song, that's

33:45.545 --> 33:47.112
just what I was doing.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.201
Anyway, remember Woody?

33:56.556 --> 34:00.647
Helmet for a pillow.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.302
Ground is our bed.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.913
I watch your six, and
you'll watch mine,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.612
so we don't wake up dead.

34:09.699 --> 34:16.663
We're miles away from all we
love, brothers side by side.

34:16.750 --> 34:23.800
We all know why we're here,
why we bleed and died.

34:23.887 --> 34:29.806
We fight for freedom,
for the mini and youth,

34:29.893 --> 34:37.858
lay down our lives, feel the
rain, standing for the truth.

34:37.945 --> 34:43.690
So don't you ever worry,
sleep easy and sleep tight,

34:43.777 --> 34:51.393
'cause we are here, protecting
you, keeping watch till night.

34:51.480 --> 34:57.617
We're simple soldiers,
doing what we do.

34:57.704 --> 35:04.928
Just simple
soldiers, yeah, yeah.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.582
We would did for you.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.590
We would die for you.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.829
That was him.

35:35.916 --> 35:36.916
Crazy.

35:39.006 --> 35:45.230
roll my windows down,
and cruise down a back road--

35:45.317 --> 35:47.971
Bryan Cranston, that actor.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.538
You lie.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.452
And he rode right by me,

35:50.539 --> 35:52.019
I swear it was him.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.020
Bryan Cranston, the
"Breaking Bad" guy.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.587
Shuts up.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.545
My god, he's one
hunk of a redheaded man.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.330
Why didn't you pull him over?

35:58.417 --> 36:00.767
Yeah, that's a great idea.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.335
Like I'm going to pull
over Bryan Cranston.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.466
Why not?

36:04.553 --> 36:05.380
Please.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.381
I would have.

36:06.468 --> 36:07.817
I love me some ginger.

36:13.649 --> 36:14.346
OK.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.608
You still there?

36:15.695 --> 36:17.262
Yeah.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.437
Sweetheart, are you OK?

36:18.524 --> 36:19.655
Yes.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.136
I am, I really--

36:22.223 --> 36:23.703
I needed this, Emmers.

36:23.790 --> 36:24.791
I did.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.358
I hated that frickin' job.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.447
And that dingleberry
I had to answer to.

36:28.534 --> 36:35.280
My life for so long it's
just been so dang boring.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.846
You just need a man.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.848
Well, men don't like me.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.415
Men like you.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.157
Men like strippers,
they like pole grinders,

36:43.244 --> 36:46.987
girls who twerk for a living.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.468
It's brutal.

36:49.555 --> 36:52.340
Look, Emmers, I know, I
know, it was impulsive of me.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.995
To just storm out
like that, but I --

36:55.082 --> 36:57.650
I just had to, I had
to had a break away,

36:57.737 --> 37:00.043
free myself from all the shit.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.828
You know?

37:01.915 --> 37:07.660
And it feels good.

37:07.747 --> 37:10.837
'Cause it's
dangerous, I like it.

37:10.924 --> 37:12.404
I like it.

37:12.491 --> 37:17.017
Feels like I'm just
living on the edge.

37:17.104 --> 37:20.063
I just hope that running away
was the right thing, you know?

37:20.150 --> 37:22.501
Yeah,
well, it is, I know it is.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.416
You
know what you should do?

37:24.503 --> 37:27.027
Something you never do.

37:27.114 --> 37:27.854
You should just--

37:27.941 --> 37:28.985
What?

37:29.072 --> 37:29.899
You ready?

37:29.986 --> 37:30.857
Yeah, I'm ready.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.338
Let your hair down.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.340
Yeah, no, I should.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.471
Can you imagine?

37:36.558 --> 37:38.343
I'll just let it down.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.996
Now.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.043
I don't wear it down,
I wear it up, and I--

37:43.130 --> 37:44.740
and I like it up, so--.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.414
This is
the new you, Mary-Anne.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.353
You want to live dangerously?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.963
Do you?

37:50.050 --> 37:52.095
Then grab danger by
the balls, and do it.

37:52.182 --> 37:53.488
Do it.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.142
Jeez Louise.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.230
Fine.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.317
Fine.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.540
Good Lord, I
don't know about that.

38:01.627 --> 38:03.237
No, I don't think so.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.804
So where are you at now?

38:04.891 --> 38:07.197
Fixing to pass Las Cruces.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.330
Florida, here I come.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.636
It's going to be fun.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.556
What on earth was that?

38:17.643 --> 38:19.558
That's him, that's him!

38:19.645 --> 38:20.559
That's him!

38:20.646 --> 38:21.908
That's Bryan Cranston!

38:21.995 --> 38:24.084
He must be going
100 miles an hour.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.651
So hot.

38:25.738 --> 38:26.434
Try
and stay with him.

38:26.521 --> 38:27.522
I'm trying.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.132
I'm trying, he's too fast.

38:29.219 --> 38:30.979
My god, Mary-Anne,
don't let him get away.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.184
Bryan!

38:37.271 --> 38:38.271
Bryan, wait!

38:42.189 --> 38:43.189
Wait!

38:46.193 --> 38:47.890
Are you kidding me right now?

38:49.414 --> 38:51.329
Come on.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.416
Jesus.

39:24.840 --> 39:28.148
Hi, um, just $12, please.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.942
You sure are pretty.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.029
What's that?

39:42.467 --> 39:44.294
Thank you, that's, um--

39:44.382 --> 39:45.426
thank you.

39:45.513 --> 39:48.037
You're-- you're so creative.

39:52.781 --> 39:55.654
What is that you're whittling?

39:55.741 --> 39:57.569
A spearhead.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.051
Coming along very nicely.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.108
Miss?

40:15.195 --> 40:16.694
Yeah, I'm sorry, I
don't have time to chat.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.329
I'm really-- I'm trying
to catch somebody.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.592
Would you like some candy?

40:23.333 --> 40:24.596
Ew.

40:24.683 --> 40:25.771
That's ew.

40:56.497 --> 40:57.497
Hey?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.328
Excuse me?

41:01.415 --> 41:03.243
Yoo-hoo?

41:03.330 --> 41:05.419
Excuse me, Mr. Cranston?

41:05.506 --> 41:08.335
All right, you OK?

41:08.422 --> 41:11.294
You all right there?

41:11.381 --> 41:14.863
I was coming in pretty quick.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.737
Shit, I might've
clipped its hind leg.

41:18.824 --> 41:25.047
Your beard is amazing.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.875
Yeah?

41:26.962 --> 41:29.269
It's kind of like carrying
a porcupine on your chin.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.666
It must be for a role.

41:37.146 --> 41:40.976
You think the dog was hurt, or?

41:41.063 --> 41:43.979
Well, it's hard to tell.

41:44.066 --> 41:47.592
Took off running so damned fast.

41:47.679 --> 41:49.724
At least
you kept straight.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.900
Better the dog than you.

41:51.987 --> 41:52.988
That is the upside.

41:57.863 --> 41:58.863
So are you--

42:01.170 --> 42:03.956
you working on anything new, or?

42:05.610 --> 42:09.614
What, no, I'm just
being fan, a silly fan.

42:09.701 --> 42:12.442
That's--

42:12.530 --> 42:13.922
Come here, boy!

42:19.319 --> 42:20.319
Come here, boy!

42:42.342 --> 42:44.692
That was just me.

42:44.779 --> 42:47.303
Come here, boy.

42:47.390 --> 42:50.263
Come here, boy.

42:50.350 --> 42:51.350
Come on.

42:54.789 --> 42:57.531
I sure do you like your scooter.

42:57.618 --> 42:58.837
You know bikes?

42:58.924 --> 43:00.621
Well, I'm a Texas girl.

43:00.708 --> 43:03.798
It's either real
horses, or steel horses.

43:03.885 --> 43:05.104
No choice.

43:05.191 --> 43:09.282
Got to ride one or the other.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.718
No shit.

43:10.805 --> 43:12.241
It's hot, in the car.

43:18.552 --> 43:20.032
Sure you don't want one?

43:20.119 --> 43:22.251
Ice cold.

43:22.338 --> 43:24.297
I'm all good, thanks.

43:24.384 --> 43:26.691
Let's see, where are we?

43:26.778 --> 43:28.518
We should be somewhere
right around there.

43:32.958 --> 43:34.655
It was pretty easy
to get turned around

43:34.742 --> 43:37.092
on these country roads.

43:37.179 --> 43:38.746
Yeah.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.792
I'm Mary-Anne Mackey.

43:40.879 --> 43:42.445
People call me Ghost.

43:44.926 --> 43:47.320
People call you Ghost?

43:47.407 --> 43:48.190
Again.

43:48.277 --> 43:50.584
That's amazing.

43:50.671 --> 43:52.325
Low profile, I like it.

43:52.412 --> 43:55.720
Well, I got it because
nobody ever sees me coming.

43:55.807 --> 43:59.419
They'd sure hear you, though.

43:59.506 --> 44:00.506
Because of the scooter.

44:03.510 --> 44:07.862
You be careful out
there, Mary-Anne Mackey.

44:07.949 --> 44:11.387
I should be at work right now.

44:11.474 --> 44:14.477
Playing hooky?

44:14.564 --> 44:15.564
I up and quit.

44:19.004 --> 44:21.049
Tell you something, Mr. Ghost.

44:24.052 --> 44:25.837
Five days a week
I woke up at 6:00

44:25.924 --> 44:32.278
AM sharp to classic iPhone
Marimba ringtone number one.

44:32.365 --> 44:39.111
I make it 1,870 hours
a year sitting in an 8

44:39.198 --> 44:42.462
by 12 cubicle turning
some son of a bitch rich.

44:42.549 --> 44:45.900
Only thing I had to look forward
to was Monday through Friday,

44:45.987 --> 44:48.468
somewhere between 3:25 and
3:30 Cleve the office boy,

44:48.555 --> 44:50.949
he'd make a Starbucks
run, bring me back

44:51.036 --> 44:55.649
a venti, two pump, caramel
macchiato, extra hot.

44:55.736 --> 45:02.134
I'm a single, hard working,
professional woman,

45:02.221 --> 45:06.312
who ate a lot of horse shit.

45:06.399 --> 45:08.183
And I just--

45:08.270 --> 45:12.144
I woke up a couple mornings
ago, and I said to myself,

45:12.231 --> 45:16.017
gosh darn it, I need some
excitement in my life.

45:35.950 --> 45:36.950
Jeez.

45:50.878 --> 45:51.878
OK.

45:55.448 --> 45:56.448
Sorry.

46:05.806 --> 46:06.806
Sorry.

46:21.822 --> 46:22.822
Disney World.

46:24.346 --> 46:25.043
That's
where I'm headed.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.609
For excitement.

46:26.696 --> 46:28.263
I guess I misunderstood.

46:31.310 --> 46:35.357
I've never done
anything that before.

46:35.444 --> 46:36.444
Have you?

46:39.535 --> 46:40.536
When I was 17.

46:44.192 --> 46:48.588
Well, I won't leak
this, I promise.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.503
Probably best you don't.

46:54.942 --> 46:57.423
You know what I want?

46:57.510 --> 47:01.644
I'd be guessing,
but a little cuddle.

47:01.731 --> 47:03.908
To be you.

47:03.995 --> 47:05.648
Just for a flash.

47:05.735 --> 47:08.521
Just to know what it feels like.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.481
You ever want what I have?

47:16.834 --> 47:17.834
All the time.

47:39.160 --> 47:40.379
Albuquerque Crowne Plaza.

47:45.732 --> 47:47.603
See you down the road, stud.

47:51.259 --> 47:54.132
St. Louis like Louis
D, Miles, and Larry Hughes.

47:54.219 --> 47:56.874
And the Young Dude done
paid young dudes' dues dude.

47:56.961 --> 47:59.398
But yo, what da hook gon' be?

47:59.485 --> 48:01.966
Yo, see I don't need no
fucking hook on this beat.

48:02.053 --> 48:03.489
Shit!

48:03.576 --> 48:05.119
All I need is the track
in the background.

48:05.143 --> 48:06.729
My headphones loud, keep
the blunt going around.

48:06.753 --> 48:07.797
And I'm-a rip.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.451
Yo, yo, wat da hook gon' be?

48:09.538 --> 48:12.454
See I don't need no
fucking hook on this beat.

48:12.541 --> 48:14.413
Shit.

48:14.500 --> 48:15.607
All I need is the track in the
background, my headphones loud.

48:15.631 --> 48:16.850
Keep the blunt going round.

48:16.937 --> 48:20.201
And the sun will
come out tomorrow,

48:20.288 --> 48:21.942
and I will never have to borrow.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.378
Got my first car when I turned--

48:26.642 --> 48:28.427
No.

48:28.514 --> 48:29.514
No.

48:33.084 --> 48:34.912
I'm sorry.

48:34.999 --> 48:35.999
It's declined.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.094
You don't ride, do you?

48:57.456 --> 49:00.938
Troopin', troopin',
troopin' to the sea.

49:01.025 --> 49:06.552
'Ere September come again,
the six year men are free.

49:06.639 --> 49:11.949
Leave the dead behind us,
for they cannot come away,

49:12.036 --> 49:17.389
to where the ship's a-coalin'
up that takes us home today.

49:17.476 --> 49:23.221
We're going home, we're going
home, a ship is at the shore.

49:23.308 --> 49:25.353
And you must pack
your 'aversack,

49:25.440 --> 49:29.401
for we won't come back no more.

49:29.488 --> 49:34.145
Don't you grieve for
me my lovely Mary-Anne.

49:37.148 --> 49:42.066
For I'll marry you
yet, on a fourp'ny bed,

49:42.153 --> 49:45.112
as a time-expired man.

49:45.199 --> 49:47.158
Man, don't fill your
head with that shit.

49:51.162 --> 49:53.599
I think it's beautiful.

49:53.686 --> 49:54.904
It's useless.

49:54.992 --> 49:55.993
Doesn't serve you.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.342
But it does.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.303
Man, I'm telling
you it's the energy

50:02.390 --> 50:04.262
you need to put into
something bigger.

50:07.221 --> 50:08.222
Such as?

50:08.309 --> 50:09.397
Yourself.

50:09.484 --> 50:11.617
Got a lot of work to do.

50:11.704 --> 50:14.141
Wasting your time.

50:14.228 --> 50:16.665
Only thing real
you got is time.

50:16.752 --> 50:18.928
Just because you didn't
take a bullet over there,

50:19.016 --> 50:22.584
doesn't mean the mission's over.

50:22.671 --> 50:23.368
The mission?

50:23.455 --> 50:26.066
Life, brother.

50:26.153 --> 50:27.676
Look here, man.

50:27.763 --> 50:28.634
The books, the poems,
you're lost in them,

50:28.721 --> 50:30.331
come back to us, OK?

50:30.418 --> 50:31.917
Those are other people's
dreams, they're not yours.

50:31.941 --> 50:34.031
You just holding onto
them because you've

50:34.118 --> 50:35.728
given up on your own.

50:35.815 --> 50:37.556
Heal the fucking
wounds and move on.

50:40.298 --> 50:41.690
I said heal them, Will.

50:41.777 --> 50:43.257
Not open them up.

50:45.955 --> 50:47.566
Silence is the killer.

50:53.963 --> 50:56.140
Silence is the killer.

50:56.227 --> 50:57.750
I'm giving you an ear, brother.

50:57.837 --> 50:58.837
Use it.

51:00.535 --> 51:02.059
It's just you and
me here, brother.

51:05.323 --> 51:10.154
Now, remember when we were
kids, we were in school?

51:10.241 --> 51:11.546
We would have share days.

51:15.333 --> 51:17.030
Those RPG hits to our convoy.

51:19.902 --> 51:23.036
You want to take a
stroll down memory lane?

51:23.123 --> 51:24.403
We lit those
fucking vehicles up.

51:24.429 --> 51:25.734
We powed out of the back.

51:25.821 --> 51:27.388
I was there, I
know what happened.

51:27.475 --> 51:29.062
I don't care to be
thinking about this shit.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.348
And I watched
that kid jump out

51:30.435 --> 51:34.003
of the forward Humvee, Will.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.440
One big flame.

52:02.597 --> 52:06.210
He's flailing around,
screaming my name.

52:06.297 --> 52:09.169
And I looked at him.

52:09.256 --> 52:12.738
I did, I looked at
him, and I remember

52:12.825 --> 52:15.219
thinking, how messed
up, how disfigured he'd

52:15.306 --> 52:17.308
be if he shipped back home.

52:20.267 --> 52:25.925
And I was happy
that it wasn't me.

52:30.364 --> 52:32.410
I condemn myself
for that thought.

52:35.195 --> 52:37.110
There ain't no
compassion in that.

52:46.337 --> 52:47.337
Ghost.

52:54.432 --> 52:57.435
It's your turn, brother.

52:57.522 --> 53:00.394
You gotta talk.

53:00.481 --> 53:01.481
I don't.

53:23.156 --> 53:24.984
You sure about this?

53:25.071 --> 53:29.858
$200 seems like an awfully good
deal for this kind of watch.

53:29.945 --> 53:31.512
We're all set.

53:31.599 --> 53:33.297
Well, if that's all
you'll take for it,

53:33.384 --> 53:35.473
I'm going to throw
in your drinks, too.

53:35.560 --> 53:36.430
If you don't mind.

53:36.517 --> 53:37.605
Sure do appreciate it.

53:41.348 --> 53:42.393
Refill, please.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.308
I'm going to take it to go.

53:44.395 --> 53:45.570
You got it.

53:55.188 --> 53:56.276
Powdered Creamer?

53:56.363 --> 53:57.363
A touch, thanks.

54:01.586 --> 54:03.022
Here you go.

54:03.109 --> 54:07.331
And another round
for my friend, here.

54:07.418 --> 54:14.033
Well, I got him
covered, but here you are.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.817
Compliments of the
young service member.

54:15.904 --> 54:17.689
Mighty nice of you, thank you.

54:17.776 --> 54:20.169
And I'll thank you in return.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.083
How's that?

54:21.170 --> 54:23.172
I see you there.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.260
Army?

54:26.785 --> 54:30.441
Saw your memorial bracelet.

54:30.528 --> 54:31.355
Yeah, well.

54:31.442 --> 54:32.965
It was a body.

54:33.052 --> 54:34.445
Sorry to hear.

54:34.532 --> 54:35.881
Wearing that, you must miss him.

54:35.968 --> 54:38.013
Actually I can't
get rid of him.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.631
Thanks for serving, my friend.

54:52.332 --> 54:54.595
I was 1st battalion,
8th Marines.

54:54.682 --> 55:01.950
Got out after the
Beirut bombing, 1983.

55:02.037 --> 55:04.997
Islamic jihad took
241 Americans,

55:05.084 --> 55:06.999
but they didn't take me.

55:07.086 --> 55:09.741
Bad day.

55:09.828 --> 55:12.874
I was a younger man,
I'd still be fighting.

55:12.961 --> 55:14.006
To the warriors.

55:14.093 --> 55:15.093
Warriors.

55:23.102 --> 55:23.929
Sherry.

55:24.016 --> 55:25.016
Larry.

55:29.369 --> 55:32.894
You ready young lady?

55:32.981 --> 55:33.981
Duh.

55:36.985 --> 55:37.985
Here you go.

55:50.216 --> 55:51.304
Who is she talking to?

55:53.959 --> 55:55.569
Your guess is as good as mine.

55:59.443 --> 56:00.443
You ready for this?

56:04.709 --> 56:10.236
She broke my 16-year-old
heart, she did.

56:10.323 --> 56:11.411
Can you believe it?

56:11.498 --> 56:13.457
I would.

56:13.544 --> 56:14.849
Boy boy.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.766
I could tell you some stories.

56:21.421 --> 56:23.597
She was my first love.

56:23.684 --> 56:26.687
I took her to the
high school prom.

56:26.774 --> 56:32.040
She was a hell of
a looker back then.

56:32.127 --> 56:33.127
Is that so?

56:35.609 --> 56:37.698
Yeah, but then she let
the guys get all over her,

56:37.785 --> 56:40.658
and that done changed her.

56:40.745 --> 56:44.488
She ain't the girl she used
to be, that's for sure.

56:44.575 --> 56:46.968
You took her to your prom?

56:47.055 --> 56:48.055
I did.

56:51.320 --> 56:55.281
In a big old shiny limousine.

56:55.368 --> 56:57.239
Can she dance?

56:57.326 --> 56:59.503
Let me think about that.

56:59.590 --> 57:01.505
I believe so.

57:01.592 --> 57:04.290
Why don't I turn up the music,
and you could get on out there

57:04.377 --> 57:06.945
and see what she's got.

57:11.689 --> 57:14.169
All right.

57:14.256 --> 57:15.867
Friend?

57:15.954 --> 57:18.652
She's just an old
bird, looking for more.

57:18.739 --> 57:20.524
Doesn't know how to
go about getting it.

57:20.611 --> 57:21.960
You with me?

57:22.047 --> 57:23.047
I gotcha.

57:32.057 --> 57:33.057
Young lady?

57:35.408 --> 57:37.497
Never seen you before.

57:37.584 --> 57:39.325
The fuck is that?

57:39.412 --> 57:40.805
It's my hand.

57:40.892 --> 57:42.043
Well I know it's
your hand, dummy.

57:42.067 --> 57:43.416
That's--

57:43.503 --> 57:46.985
Well, it's an invitation.

57:47.072 --> 57:50.292
Invitation?

57:50.379 --> 57:52.164
Where are you going to take me?

57:52.251 --> 57:55.515
Well, I was going to take
you out to the dance floor.

57:55.602 --> 57:57.909
Where I really
want to go is France.

57:57.996 --> 57:58.692
France?

57:58.779 --> 58:00.433
France,

58:00.520 --> 58:03.567
Well, that could be tough.

58:03.654 --> 58:05.612
You for real want to dance?

58:05.699 --> 58:10.269
I'll bet you could teach
me a couple of things.

58:10.356 --> 58:14.578
I am a little bit older.

58:14.665 --> 58:17.276
I shit, I'm not much
of a mover anymore.

58:17.363 --> 58:20.497
You know back in the day I could
have showed you a real mean

58:20.584 --> 58:23.369
Cotton Eye Joe.

58:23.456 --> 58:26.328
Don't make me beg, now.

58:26.415 --> 58:27.415
All right.

58:32.378 --> 58:36.469
Let's see if I remember
how the fuck to do this.

58:36.556 --> 58:37.556
Whoop, got you.

58:40.125 --> 58:41.648
All right.

58:41.735 --> 58:43.408
You may want to
hold onto my shoulders,

58:43.432 --> 58:45.783
and just shake your hips
and walk around real slow,

58:45.870 --> 58:46.870
ain't much to it.

58:46.914 --> 58:47.785
That's all got to do?

58:47.872 --> 58:49.700
All you got to do.

58:49.787 --> 58:51.136
I can do that.

58:51.223 --> 58:52.093
Hey, Larry?

58:52.180 --> 58:54.400
Don't get jealous, now.

58:54.487 --> 58:56.837
I can cut in whenever
you're ready, darling.

59:10.024 --> 59:11.809
I feel so bad.

59:11.896 --> 59:15.856
I got a worried mind.

59:15.943 --> 59:19.817
I'm so lonesome all the time.

59:19.904 --> 59:21.993
Something like this?

59:22.080 --> 59:23.864
Something like that.

59:23.951 --> 59:26.071
Leave my
baby behind on Blue Bayou.

59:29.740 --> 59:41.665
Save a nickle, save a dime,
work until the sun don't shine.

59:41.752 --> 59:46.278
Looking forward to happy
time on Blue Bayou.

59:50.021 --> 59:57.028
I'm going back some day,
come what may, to Blue Bayou.

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:01.509
Where the--

01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:16.613
Bum, bum,
budum bum, bum bum.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.224
I wouldn't do that.

01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.965
You're shit faced.

01:00:21.052 --> 01:00:23.837
You are underestimating
me, First Sergeant.

01:00:23.924 --> 01:00:26.492
I am sober.

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:32.063
Get on over here, you old
see through son of a bitch.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:33.412
I gotta tell you something.

01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.240
OK, tell me.

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:36.870
All right, but you gotta
promise you won't take it

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:37.590
the wrong way.

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:38.417
I promise.

01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:39.374
Scout's honor.

01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:40.114
I'm going to tell you.

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:41.507
Tell me.

01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:43.465
You are sexy as
shit for a dead guy.

01:00:43.552 --> 01:00:45.163
Get out of here.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.880
That shit ain't worked for
me since I crossed over,

01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:49.950
but I gave you a heads
up on it, though.

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:51.822
You're so lucky, man.

01:00:51.909 --> 01:00:54.041
Why am I lucky, Ghost?

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:58.263
Because for you, it ain't
about fucking anymore, is it?

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.786
Who told you that?

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.111
It's obvious, dead
dudes don't fuck.

01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:02.441
Where'd you hear that from?

01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:04.965
I researched it.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:07.664
But it ain't about fucking
at all, is it really?

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.100
Here, there?

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:10.338
I mean what we
need to be doing is

01:01:10.362 --> 01:01:11.885
teaching people what you know.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:12.973
I wouldn't argue on that.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.496
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.890
Look, people gotta
learn how to love, man.

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.805
Who are you it's?

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:21.460
It's what's in here, not
here, that's what it's about.

01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:22.547
And you know what?

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:23.591
Where's my friend?

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:24.898
Where is Ghost?

01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:25.551
I want to find Ghost.

01:01:25.638 --> 01:01:27.422
Look.

01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:29.511
You probably spend
about 20 of your 30

01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:32.776
some odd years here
on earth and about 90%

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:36.431
of those 20 years
looking for poontang.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:37.041
Yeah.

01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:38.782
Why?

01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:41.262
Exactly.

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:44.962
Now, I'm a bit of a philosopher.

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:46.790
I think a little
outside the box.

01:01:46.877 --> 01:01:48.530
Just a little bit?

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:51.490
It occurred to me, since
dead dudes don't fuck,

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:55.059
then clearly poontang is not of
importance in your dimensions.

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:57.801
Why do we think we need
it so bad here, man?

01:01:57.888 --> 01:02:00.281
I mean break it down,
its primary function

01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:03.067
is to provide by a porthole
from one side to the.

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:06.505
An entryway, if you will.

01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:08.246
With hair on.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.814
Soft type, but you know
that's how I like it, Buddy.

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:12.511
I like a big old bush.

01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:14.600
You like it so much
it's on your fucking face.

01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:15.949
I get lost in it.

01:02:16.036 --> 01:02:17.342
I need to know
the point, Ghost.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:18.429
What's the point?

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.739
Hold up.

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:25.002
Am I following you, 'cause I--

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:27.047
I thought it was you.

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:28.483
Man, I was following you.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:36.795
Let me see that.

01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:41.453
Left foot, right foot.

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:50.809
All right.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:11.744
Sammy, I made a
decision that I'm going

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:14.703
to regret the rest of my life.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.791
What's that?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:25.062
I put my best friend in the
enemy's skull, and I lost him.

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:27.412
I made the decision on my
own to break cover, Will.

01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:32.156
I was careless.

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:41.992
Look at me.

01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:49.913
You were brave.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.786
You trusted me.

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:56.484
I'd take a bullet
to bring you back.

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:04.405
What do I--

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.411
What do I do?

01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:11.498
Fuck.

01:04:58.111 --> 01:04:59.721
It's perfect, thank you.

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:01.723
Just use the bed right there.

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:12.038
Here you go.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.257
It's a beautiful day.

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:05.830
Will?

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:09.965
William?

01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:22.934
Is that you?

01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:35.426
Looks like you're
a pretty good shot.

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:40.605
I think I may know
where you get that from.

01:06:44.174 --> 01:06:45.174
You know who I am?

01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:50.571
Yes, sir.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:52.791
You sure?

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:53.878
Yes, sir.

01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:02.801
Can I approach you?

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:05.195
Yes sir.

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:06.370
It's all right, buddy.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:17.468
I brought you this
monster truck.

01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:20.819
I don't know if you're
into these things,

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:26.520
but it seemed kind of cool.

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:30.915
I like it.

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:38.532
Boy, it's been so long
I hardly recognize you.

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:42.187
Yes, sir.

01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:46.017
You got big.

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:53.373
My momma told me that you
got sick during the war.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.724
She said you had to go away.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:59.945
Your momma said that?

01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:01.164
Is it true?

01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:04.167
Yeah, it is.

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:06.169
Did you get injured?

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:07.344
I did.

01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:08.431
What happened?

01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:15.352
I got caught a
couple of explosions.

01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:18.180
They injured my brain.

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:21.140
They call it TBI.

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:23.577
What's TBI?

01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:27.712
Traumatic brain injury.

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:32.325
And I-- I lost a
friend over there, too,

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:33.674
and that hurt me pretty bad.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.939
I lost a lot, actually.

01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:42.988
I lost your momma, I lost you.

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.075
Are you better now?

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:51.649
Son, right this
second I sure am.

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:26.596
William!

01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:27.946
Get away from my son.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:43.046
Kimmie?

01:10:12.991 --> 01:10:14.253
What's wrong?

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.995
Don't be alarmed.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.649
What?

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:21.086
William's father
showed up here today.

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:25.132
And?

01:10:28.093 --> 01:10:29.093
Jesus.

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:44.022
I told him that I needed
to speak to you first,

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:49.332
that it wasn't an appropriate
time to visit, but he insisted.

01:10:49.419 --> 01:10:51.508
I'm sorry, Buddy.

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:53.292
I had to put dinner
on, he's still here.

01:10:53.379 --> 01:10:54.250
Where is he?

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:55.381
He's here right now?

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:56.339
Where?

01:10:56.426 --> 01:10:57.818
He want to see William.

01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.603
And that's a
decision he made when?

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:01.605
He's in Will's room.

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.827
I couldn't refuse him.

01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:09.656
Well, he just going
to have to leave.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:10.570
No.

01:11:10.657 --> 01:11:11.179
It's that simple.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:11.832
No.

01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:14.052
Just--

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.358
All right, I'll leave.

01:11:15.445 --> 01:11:16.489
No, stay, God dammit.

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:17.664
Please don't do this to me.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.935
Shit.

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:33.550
This is called
a wedge formation.

01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:35.552
Why do they use it?

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:38.946
Well, you got all your
firepower here at the front,

01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:43.255
and see your flanks this
whole sector is covered.

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.344
Are you out of the Army now?

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.431
Yeah.

01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.915
Do you miss it?

01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:52.351
Every day.

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:54.397
Why don't you go back?

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:57.748
Because I got things
to do here, now.

01:11:57.835 --> 01:12:01.404
Were you a ground pounder?

01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:03.362
You know about
ground pounders?

01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:05.538
My friend's brother
is in the Air Force.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:08.324
That's what he calls army guys.

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:10.587
I want to be in the military.

01:12:10.674 --> 01:12:14.808
Little man, I fought
so you wouldn't have to.

01:12:14.895 --> 01:12:17.594
I just don't think I
can handle civilian life.

01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.510
What makes you think you
can handle military life?

01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:21.946
What makes you think I can't?

01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:26.472
You love your country?

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:27.952
Yes, sir.

01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:31.999
Well, that's the
only requirement.

01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:35.046
I think the army would
be happy to have you.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.308
The Navy.

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:37.570
The what?

01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:39.442
I want to be a Seal.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:40.965
A Seal?

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:43.446
What, about like
Delta or something?

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:44.795
No, a Seal.

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:49.234
Let's say we'll
talk about that later.

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:11.082
Will has his player
evaluations coming up

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:12.213
for the new season.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.954
It's an exciting afternoon.

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:18.306
There's barbecuing and
games for the kids, music.

01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:24.791
Be nice if you could come, Will.

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:26.271
When is that?

01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:31.407
Its next
week, I have to--

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:32.494
I'd have to look.

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:41.591
So what are your plans, Will?

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:46.291
I'm not sure.

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.378
So you're missing work?

01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:51.905
I don't really
have a set schedule.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:53.864
Buddy.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:55.474
Mom, can I have more pasta?

01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:57.607
Yeah, of course.

01:13:57.694 --> 01:13:59.347
I'm glad you like it.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.479
California, right?

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:02.655
You said that's where you live.

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:04.527
Correct.

01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:06.113
So what are you doing
in Cali that you can just

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:07.878
pick up and go?

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.401
Bud, you want
an extra helping?

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:10.533
No, thank you, sweetheart.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.056
I'm fine, thanks.

01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:13.536
Will?

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:15.059
No, thank you.

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:20.891
I'm a painter.

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:22.240
So am I.

01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.371
You paint?

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.198
I do.

01:14:24.285 --> 01:14:24.982
Come on.

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.069
That's awesome.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.657
That's wonderful, Will.

01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:31.379
That's surprising.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.859
Really?

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.034
Does your work sell?

01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:39.475
It's public.

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:40.562
Site specific?

01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:48.266
Sure would love to see your
portfolio sometime, Will.

01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:55.447
One would think that us country
folk out here don't appreciate

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:59.407
the fine arts, but I assure
you, that is just not the case.

01:15:02.846 --> 01:15:06.502
What is it, exactly,
that you country folk

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.460
appreciate about it?

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:11.115
Mom, may I be excused to go
finish setting up my soldiers?

01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.118
That's fine, but you need
to ask somebody else, too.

01:15:14.205 --> 01:15:15.249
Dad?

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:16.336
Yeah.

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:32.658
Goodbye.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:35.618
Bye.

01:15:35.705 --> 01:15:37.968
Thank you.

01:15:38.055 --> 01:15:40.187
I apologize, I know
that was uncomfortable.

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:42.538
It was all just so
sudden, that's all.

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.322
Hey, I'm happy for you.

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:50.458
He's a good man.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.895
It's what you always wanted.

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:57.770
Nice to finally meet you.

01:15:57.857 --> 01:15:59.467
Thank you for
your hospitality.

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:08.520
So you came here
for your son, right?

01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:11.784
Put me at ease, right now.

01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:12.871
At ease.

01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:44.556
The angels
are stooping above your bed.

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:49.126
They are weary of trooping
with the whimpering dead.

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:54.087
God's laughing in heaven
to see you so good,

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:58.265
the sailing seven are
gay with this mood.

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:06.926
I sigh and I kiss you, for I
must own that I shall miss you

01:17:07.013 --> 01:17:08.145
when you have grown.

01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:23.769
Hello?

01:17:23.856 --> 01:17:26.772
Mary-Anne Mackey?

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:31.734
Hello, invisible man.

01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.344
I knew that was you.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:37.827
Come on up.

01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:52.755
You need to be alone?

01:17:52.842 --> 01:17:53.842
No.

01:17:57.847 --> 01:17:58.847
Tell me.

01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:08.640
We don't talk
about him so much, hon.

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:11.164
He's not at all what I expected.

01:18:13.993 --> 01:18:15.038
Which was?

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:20.738
I don't know.

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:28.399
Just taking it all in.

01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:30.662
You still love him.

01:18:30.749 --> 01:18:32.577
Why would you ask that?

01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:37.495
It's not a question.

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.542
I love you.

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:55.165
What?

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:59.691
You are so beautiful.

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:12.617
You are so talented.

01:19:15.315 --> 01:19:17.187
I don't know
what you're saying,

01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:21.626
but I'm going to take those
kind words and run with them.

01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:24.020
Your work.

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:27.632
I love your work.

01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:28.719
Action!

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:46.912
More, please.

01:19:46.999 --> 01:19:47.999
More.

01:20:08.978 --> 01:20:09.892
Ghost.

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:11.502
Who's Ghost?

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:13.939
Hi.

01:20:14.026 --> 01:20:14.897
Hi, darling.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:16.637
How are you?

01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:17.963
What happened?

01:20:17.987 --> 01:20:19.162
What?

01:20:19.249 --> 01:20:20.511
What happened what?

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:22.121
You sound different.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.993
No, I can't lie to you.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.604
Spill it.

01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:29.607
I really like her.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.174
Is it love?

01:20:33.567 --> 01:20:35.787
I don't know, I
guess it could be.

01:20:35.874 --> 01:20:37.920
What base you
at, you old perv.

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:40.444
You know, first, second.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.838
I hit a homer
first time at bat.

01:20:44.404 --> 01:20:46.015
My brother, you disappoint me.

01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.495
What happened to it's in here.

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:49.322
I know.

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:50.671
Not in here.

01:20:50.758 --> 01:20:51.759
I know.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.457
You're working backwards.

01:20:53.544 --> 01:20:54.937
Apparently.

01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:56.939
Hold off on introducing
yourself to her.

01:20:57.026 --> 01:21:00.377
You don't want to
freak the girl out.

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:02.074
Met this guy.

01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:02.945
No shit.

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:05.121
And?

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.557
And, I--

01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:07.906
You what?

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:09.952
I want to take
him home with me.

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:11.039
Yeah!

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.739
What was that?

01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:15.958
That's fantastic.

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:17.089
So tell me about him.

01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:22.747
Well.

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:26.403
So this is the master
plan, but it's all good.

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:28.579
You feel it?

01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:30.320
Feels right.

01:21:30.407 --> 01:21:32.365
This last phase of your
life, where you landed,

01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.585
it was just supposed
to be a layover.

01:21:34.672 --> 01:21:37.109
You just missed your connecting
flight, but you know what?

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:39.242
Someone up there must
like you, because there's

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:40.808
another one boarding right now.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:44.073
And if you run, you
might just catch it.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.249
Will my baggage make it?

01:21:46.336 --> 01:21:47.511
Let's hope the hell not.

01:21:53.604 --> 01:22:02.526
You know, man, 11 years ago
my wife delivered by c-section.

01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:05.833
The doctor reached into
the hole in her stomach,

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:09.446
and with blue rubber gloved
hand pulls out my son,

01:22:09.533 --> 01:22:12.362
and holds him under
this white operating

01:22:12.449 --> 01:22:18.890
light, long waxy umbilical
cord dangling below.

01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:21.675
And I have forgotten
everything prior

01:22:21.762 --> 01:22:25.549
to that moment, 'cause
the experience of meeting

01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:28.726
my son for the first time
trumped everything in my life.

01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:40.346
And then I walked away, put
on my gear, went to war.

01:22:40.433 --> 01:22:42.174
And boy, I thought I
was going to come back

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:46.396
with stories to tell him
about how brave I was, how I

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:49.225
put myself in the line of fire.

01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:52.663
In harm's way for our
country, his future.

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:57.885
Now the fighting is over, but
it's like I never came home,

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.583
because it's all I think about.

01:23:02.412 --> 01:23:04.414
I've been this guy trying
to survive his own war

01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:06.242
stories for so
long, I can't hardly

01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:09.332
remember who I'm
really supposed to be.

01:23:09.419 --> 01:23:13.075
It'll come back to you.

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:14.162
Just give it time.

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:20.908
Hope so.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:21.996
Know so.

01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:27.089
Different how?

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:31.528
Well he's kind of
rough around the edges.

01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:35.619
Well, that
can be a good thing, sometimes.

01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:37.316
Yeah, I just--

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:41.233
I hope he doesn't think
I'm one of his groupies.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.366
Whoa, stop right there.

01:23:43.453 --> 01:23:44.715
No, I'm hanging up.

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:45.672
I'm hanging up.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:46.456
Hanging up.

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:47.196
Hanging up.

01:23:47.283 --> 01:23:48.283
No, wait.

01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:52.201
What?

01:23:52.288 --> 01:23:53.848
Mary-Anne, are you
sleeping with Bryan--

01:23:56.205 --> 01:23:57.815
It's the adrenaline.

01:23:57.902 --> 01:24:01.210
Not having it one
day you're running,

01:24:01.297 --> 01:24:03.081
you're gunning,
next your standing

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:05.997
on a street corner in your
hometown, nothing but time.

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:08.130
To remember.

01:24:08.217 --> 01:24:10.915
I had a purpose over there.

01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:13.135
You got one here, too.

01:24:13.222 --> 01:24:15.963
You know, once you sort through
all this shit and own it,

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.574
is gold, baby.

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.924
There's hundreds of
thousands of veterans

01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:22.492
out there, just like you Ghost.

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:24.146
You can help them, they need it.

01:24:24.233 --> 01:24:25.973
That's your purpose,
and you mean it.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.540
OK?

01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:29.455
But you have to be a survivor.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.979
You've got to have the answers,
Ghost, or they won't listen.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:32.980
I understand.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.417
Love to help.

01:24:34.504 --> 01:24:35.611
Well, that's
your purpose, here.

01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:36.723
I mean it.

01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:37.810
I suppose.

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:44.035
You know, I have been
thinking about what you

01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:45.645
were saying about me modeling.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:47.386
So you just want to be rich.

01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:49.127
Well, wouldn't you?

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:50.085
Yo.

01:24:50.172 --> 01:24:51.999
I wrote a new song.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.325
Another thing I want to talk
to you about is the lotto.

01:24:53.349 --> 01:24:55.002
But that's illegal.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:56.154
To get the winning
numbers from the other side?

01:24:56.178 --> 01:24:57.242
I just can't give them to you.

01:24:57.266 --> 01:24:58.266
Do you know them?

01:24:58.484 --> 01:24:59.398
Maybe

01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:00.965
Well who's going to--

01:25:01.052 --> 01:25:05.143
You want to hear
the new song, or what?

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.927
OK.

01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:08.190
I don't have my guitar.

01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:10.061
I got you.

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:12.977
All right.

01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:18.243
You follow?

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.985
Clear as a bell.

01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:29.124
When the night's too
dark, and the day's too cold,

01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:37.219
and you can't find a single
thing to rest your weary soul,

01:25:37.306 --> 01:25:44.704
at the end of every tunnel,
there's a light to guide you

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:50.362
home, and you don't
have to worry,

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:52.843
'cause you'll never be alone.

01:25:55.411 --> 01:26:02.635
I will always be there for you.

01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:08.250
Said I will always
be there for you.

01:26:08.337 --> 01:26:10.121
Hey, Dad.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:14.517
No matter
what you're going through.

01:26:14.604 --> 01:26:17.128
Let's see what you got.

01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:19.086
Let's see what you got.

01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:28.966
I will
always be there for you.

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:48.246
Mom, I'm going to
go play on Dad's bike.

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.813
OK, we're coming.

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.900
Watch me, though.

01:26:55.471 --> 01:26:58.125
Hard to believe.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.213
Yeah.

01:27:13.576 --> 01:27:14.751
I can't leave here.

01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:15.838
I know that.

01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:21.105
But if I could, I
would, I would follow you.

01:27:23.716 --> 01:27:25.762
I've never seen him so happy.

01:27:25.849 --> 01:27:29.505
I've never seen you this happy.

01:27:29.592 --> 01:27:31.420
This is who I fell in love with.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.516
I watched the fighting on TV
from our living room, Will.

01:27:40.603 --> 01:27:42.431
Babe, you don't have to.

01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:44.278
And I was scared that you
were never going to come home,

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:47.523
and that I was going to be
a widow, that our son wasn't

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:48.654
going to have a father.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:53.267
I panicked.

01:27:57.184 --> 01:27:59.665
There was this woman who
moved down the street when you

01:27:59.752 --> 01:28:02.102
were gone, her name was Arlene.

01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:03.452
She was seven months pregnant.

01:28:05.976 --> 01:28:07.978
I was putting William
in the car seat

01:28:08.065 --> 01:28:11.068
when a gray army van pulled
up in front of her house.

01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:15.377
Those men weren't
even out the vehicle

01:28:15.464 --> 01:28:18.510
before she started screaming.

01:28:18.597 --> 01:28:25.343
I just ran to her, and I
left William in the car,

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:27.737
I mean we didn't
even know each other,

01:28:27.824 --> 01:28:31.001
but I held her in my
arms while they told her

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:33.743
that her husband had
been killed in action.

01:28:40.227 --> 01:28:44.144
I just couldn't bear it.

01:28:44.231 --> 01:28:45.755
I wasn't that strong.

01:28:50.542 --> 01:28:52.022
And I was lonely.

01:28:56.809 --> 01:29:00.030
And I'm still lonely.

01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:08.125
And I am so damn happy
that you're alive.

01:29:15.219 --> 01:29:19.092
Now, go be with your son.

01:29:24.184 --> 01:29:25.664
I love you.

01:30:14.104 --> 01:30:15.845
Hey.

01:30:15.932 --> 01:30:18.587
God damn, this guy stinks.

01:30:18.674 --> 01:30:20.153
Jesus Christ.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:20.980
Fuck, man.

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:21.807
Jesus.

01:30:21.894 --> 01:30:23.853
Give me that.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.462
Hey!

01:30:24.549 --> 01:30:25.549
Hey!

01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:37.693
Come on.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:39.129
Get your bag.

01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:45.352
Come on, come on, come on.

01:30:56.015 --> 01:30:57.015
Come on.

01:31:00.193 --> 01:31:00.846
Get it, boy.

01:31:00.933 --> 01:31:01.804
All right.

01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:03.240
Just like that, bro.

01:31:03.327 --> 01:31:05.068
You dance like a
fucking Weeble-Wobble.

01:31:05.155 --> 01:31:07.549
Hey, now, you ain't gotta
understand how I do, yeah?

01:31:07.636 --> 01:31:10.073
You definitely don't
understand how I do.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160
Here.

01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:14.511
Hey!

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.603
I got the patent
on that shit, man.

01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:20.866
I'm gonna call it
the one-legged jam.

01:31:22.346 --> 01:31:23.366
Hey, shit, what
are we drinking to?

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:25.044
What are we drinking?

01:31:25.131 --> 01:31:26.045
Shit.

01:31:26.132 --> 01:31:27.394
No more, motherfucker.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.135
What do you mean,
no motherfucker?

01:31:29.222 --> 01:31:30.136
I mean no more of the
fuckin' war, motherfucker.

01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:31.223
I'm drunk.

01:31:31.747 --> 01:31:32.748
I forgot.

01:31:32.835 --> 01:31:35.272
She's a marine.

01:31:35.359 --> 01:31:36.229
Let me tuck you in.

01:31:36.316 --> 01:31:37.143
I'm tucked, I'm tucked.

01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:38.580
You tucked?

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:39.905
Yeah, you are
tucked the fucking--

01:31:39.929 --> 01:31:42.453
and you're drinking.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.759
Hold this shit.

01:31:50.026 --> 01:31:53.246
Did you just pour a
fucking beer on my leg?

01:31:53.333 --> 01:31:54.509
Hey, you got a name?

01:31:54.596 --> 01:31:56.511
What do you go by?

01:31:56.598 --> 01:31:57.947
McGill.

01:31:58.034 --> 01:32:00.732
McGill Charles Burroughs, baby.

01:32:00.819 --> 01:32:04.170
Lance Corporal
Charles Burroughs.

01:32:04.257 --> 01:32:06.303
Just Charlie, though.

01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:07.304
Just Charlie.

01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:10.046
Charlie Burroughs.

01:32:10.133 --> 01:32:11.917
Fuck.

01:32:12.004 --> 01:32:13.025
You know why Marines have holes
in their forehead, Charlie

01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:13.702
Burroughs?

01:32:13.789 --> 01:32:14.485
Shit.

01:32:14.572 --> 01:32:16.182
Why is that?

01:32:16.269 --> 01:32:17.183
Because they try teach
him how to eat with a fork

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:18.663
during basic training.

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:20.839
Look, I know that's an old
one, but it's a classic.

01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:23.625
I couldn't fit my head
in a jar, so I went Army.

01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:26.932
My daddy was Army, man.

01:32:27.019 --> 01:32:31.850
Shit, he told me in the Marines
were the first to fight.

01:32:31.937 --> 01:32:35.462
You know my daddy, man.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:38.422
My daddy died overseas.

01:32:38.509 --> 01:32:41.077
Operation Iraqi Freedom.

01:32:41.164 --> 01:32:42.164
IED.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:48.911
Transport his remains all the
way up Arlington National, man.

01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:50.869
See, I ain't never been.

01:32:50.956 --> 01:32:55.613
You know, I never even had a
chance to say goodbye, either.

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.528
My mama wouldn't take me.

01:32:57.615 --> 01:33:01.227
She says she wanted me to
remember his smiling face,

01:33:01.314 --> 01:33:03.360
not his burial place.

01:33:03.447 --> 01:33:04.666
How old was he?

01:33:04.753 --> 01:33:06.145
38 years young.

01:33:09.148 --> 01:33:10.802
Shit.

01:33:10.889 --> 01:33:13.283
I enlisted right after
they put him on the ground.

01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:17.809
Went to basic, out of
basic, straight to combat.

01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:22.161
Made E3, then lost
my fucking leg.

01:33:22.248 --> 01:33:23.902
Man, I shipped right back home.

01:33:27.123 --> 01:33:30.561
I was a Marine for about a--

01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:32.389
a minute.

01:33:32.476 --> 01:33:33.584
Hey, you know they could
hook you up with a better

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:34.759
piece than this old can opener.

01:33:34.783 --> 01:33:36.175
Shit.

01:33:36.262 --> 01:33:38.569
You know, it took
about a year just

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:40.527
to get into the system, brother.

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:45.576
And then after like two years,
I still hadn't gotten anything,

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:46.708
you know what I'm saying?

01:33:46.795 --> 01:33:48.579
So I quit.

01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:50.066
That's the temp leg
lag they gave me

01:33:50.146 --> 01:33:52.278
when I first got stateside.

01:33:57.588 --> 01:33:59.198
Look, man.

01:33:59.285 --> 01:34:02.593
The military, man, they
gave my dad an education,

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.465
put food on the table.

01:34:05.552 --> 01:34:08.468
So I ain't going to talk
shit about the military.

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:14.344
But the VA, the VA's a
fucking shit show, man.

01:34:14.431 --> 01:34:16.520
No lie.

01:34:20.829 --> 01:34:21.612
Shit.

01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:22.265
OK.

01:34:22.352 --> 01:34:23.440
Shit.

01:34:23.527 --> 01:34:24.727
I'm gonna take a nap, brother.

01:34:27.705 --> 01:34:28.575
Hey.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:29.359
Here for the party.

01:34:29.446 --> 01:34:30.142
Come on in.

01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:31.143
Get you a drink?

01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:32.101
What's with the leg?

01:34:32.188 --> 01:34:33.885
It's a bit of a story.

01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:35.452
Who's that?

01:34:35.539 --> 01:34:38.281
That's my new friend,
Charlie Burroughs.

01:34:38.368 --> 01:34:39.674
Hi.

01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:40.805
What's he doing in my bed?

01:34:40.892 --> 01:34:42.111
He's a little drunk.

01:34:42.198 --> 01:34:43.852
Correct.

01:34:43.939 --> 01:34:45.854
Listen, he's a great kid.

01:34:45.941 --> 01:34:48.595
He's homeless, I offered
to let him get cleaned up,

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:51.424
but that never happened,
because we got into the tequila.

01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:53.339
And then he taught
me a couple dance

01:34:53.426 --> 01:34:56.647
moves that I'd like to show you
later, and the rest is history.

01:34:56.734 --> 01:34:59.215
I want him out of my bed.

01:34:59.302 --> 01:35:01.434
Right now.

01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:03.262
Out, out!

01:35:03.349 --> 01:35:04.829
Come on.

01:35:04.916 --> 01:35:05.787
Hey.

01:35:05.874 --> 01:35:07.658
I'm sorry, man.

01:35:07.745 --> 01:35:10.356
It's cool, it's cool.

01:35:10.443 --> 01:35:11.443
I get it.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.057
Yes.

01:35:15.144 --> 01:35:16.972
Hi.

01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:20.410
Can you send someone up to
change the sheets in my room?

01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:22.760
Thank you.

01:35:22.847 --> 01:35:23.847
Jesus.

01:35:26.068 --> 01:35:26.938
You know what?

01:35:27.025 --> 01:35:27.591
I want you both out.

01:35:27.678 --> 01:35:28.766
Both.

01:35:28.853 --> 01:35:29.724
Both of you, out.

01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:30.725
Let's move, come on.

01:35:30.812 --> 01:35:31.900
I'm moving.

01:35:36.426 --> 01:35:37.470
Now you move.

01:35:37.557 --> 01:35:39.255
Don't talk to me like that.

01:35:39.342 --> 01:35:43.825
You are in my hotel
room, may I remind you.

01:35:43.912 --> 01:35:47.350
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:35:47.437 --> 01:35:49.221
I told you to
back the fuck up.

01:35:49.308 --> 01:35:50.962
He's pointing a gun at me.

01:35:51.049 --> 01:35:51.920
Keep your voice down.

01:35:52.007 --> 01:35:54.009
Put the took gun down.

01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:56.011
How do you want this to go?

01:35:56.098 --> 01:35:57.926
How dare you.

01:35:58.013 --> 01:35:59.991
Think I'm going to let some
bitch talk to me like that?

01:36:00.015 --> 01:36:00.755
Come on, friend.

01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:03.453
Come on.

01:36:08.937 --> 01:36:10.416
Hey.

01:36:10.503 --> 01:36:12.220
I helped you back there,
why are you doing this?

01:36:12.244 --> 01:36:13.855
Say that to me, man.

01:36:13.942 --> 01:36:15.291
We're brothers.

01:36:15.378 --> 01:36:16.378
Hey.

01:36:19.164 --> 01:36:20.862
Mary-Anne, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:36:20.949 --> 01:36:22.559
Please.

01:36:22.646 --> 01:36:24.866
Listen to me.

01:36:24.953 --> 01:36:27.390
Wait, please.

01:36:27.477 --> 01:36:29.348
We're both drunk.

01:36:29.435 --> 01:36:31.674
This is going to seem really
fucking stupid in the morning.

01:36:31.698 --> 01:36:33.570
I promise you.

01:36:33.657 --> 01:36:34.919
Charlie.

01:36:35.006 --> 01:36:36.878
We're the same, bro.

01:36:36.965 --> 01:36:41.578
I served, I'm a fucking vet too,
I got the scars to prove it.

01:36:41.665 --> 01:36:44.102
And this ain't how we act.

01:36:49.586 --> 01:36:50.892
Hey.

01:36:50.979 --> 01:36:52.458
And I'm homeless.

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:10.041
I'm tired, man.

01:37:13.392 --> 01:37:14.392
I'm tired.

01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:31.671
Isn't that yours, that bag?

01:37:31.758 --> 01:37:36.546
He's so drunk, he doesn't
even realize it ain't his.

01:37:36.633 --> 01:37:39.070
Look, this is empty.

01:37:39.157 --> 01:37:41.812
The barrels plugged,
it's for show.

01:37:46.295 --> 01:37:52.779
I don't know if I
heard you right or not.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:56.914
I'm going to ask you this
one time, one time only, OK?

01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:58.698
I want the god damn
truth, you hear me?

01:37:58.785 --> 01:37:59.785
I do.

01:38:05.967 --> 01:38:09.535
Are you, or are you not?

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.060
Yeah.

01:38:15.846 --> 01:38:17.892
Are you?

01:38:17.979 --> 01:38:22.592
Are you Bryan Cranston?

01:38:25.638 --> 01:38:27.989
Not that I'm aware of.

01:38:28.076 --> 01:38:29.860
Get out.

01:38:29.947 --> 01:38:30.817
Out!

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:31.905
Get out!

01:38:35.344 --> 01:38:36.344
Out!

01:38:43.526 --> 01:38:45.049
Mom, look.

01:38:45.136 --> 01:38:46.790
I put the drawing in
here with the letter.

01:38:46.877 --> 01:38:50.054
Your dad's at the same spot.

01:38:50.141 --> 01:38:51.969
What time is it?

01:38:52.056 --> 01:38:53.449
6:15.

01:38:53.536 --> 01:38:54.929
He's late.

01:38:55.016 --> 01:38:56.539
15 minutes.

01:38:56.626 --> 01:38:58.256
Go wait by the door, and
run out and greet him

01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.280
when he gets here.

01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:04.301
Get off!

01:40:26.455 --> 01:40:28.805
No.

01:40:28.892 --> 01:40:30.633
I'm sorry.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:31.242
You did this?

01:40:31.329 --> 01:40:32.329
Why?

01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:36.681
I don't know.

01:40:53.569 --> 01:40:54.309
Here.

01:40:54.396 --> 01:40:55.396
Give me that.

01:40:59.227 --> 01:41:03.666
I'm a walking target
with this leg, man.

01:41:03.753 --> 01:41:08.236
That gun, it's just
for protection.

01:41:10.847 --> 01:41:16.113
Here rests in honor,
glory an American soldier

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:21.466
known but to God.

01:41:21.553 --> 01:41:24.208
Tomb of the Unknowns.

01:41:24.295 --> 01:41:25.775
You familiar with it?

01:41:29.213 --> 01:41:32.608
My daddy's laying close by.

01:41:32.695 --> 01:41:37.526
Tomb's guarded by soldiers
of the Army's 3rd infantry.

01:41:37.613 --> 01:41:42.226
This badge belonged
to a friend of mine.

01:41:42.313 --> 01:41:43.445
Best friend.

01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:55.761
It was an honor.

01:41:55.848 --> 01:41:57.589
After the astronaut
badge, this is

01:41:57.676 --> 01:42:00.462
the second least awarded
qualification badge

01:42:00.549 --> 01:42:03.421
of the United States Army.

01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:15.433
He'd want you have it.

01:42:19.307 --> 01:42:20.830
It goes here.

01:42:25.922 --> 01:42:26.922
Wear it proudly.

01:42:31.275 --> 01:42:32.711
It's hard-earned.

01:42:55.343 --> 01:42:58.389
I missed you so
much, little man.

01:42:58.476 --> 01:42:59.956
Don't go.

01:43:00.043 --> 01:43:01.697
Please, Dad.

01:43:01.784 --> 01:43:02.524
Hey.

01:43:02.611 --> 01:43:03.612
I'll be back.

01:43:03.699 --> 01:43:06.267
You have my word, I promise.

01:43:06.354 --> 01:43:07.355
I promise.

01:43:18.714 --> 01:43:19.280
Dad?

01:43:19.367 --> 01:43:20.063
Yeah?

01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:22.370
I love you.

01:43:22.457 --> 01:43:23.980
I love you too, boy.

01:44:01.278 --> 01:44:02.278
Go, go.

01:44:37.445 --> 01:44:38.446
Let's go.

01:44:38.533 --> 01:44:41.536
Where to?

01:44:41.623 --> 01:44:43.189
It's a surprise.

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:44.277
Get on.

01:44:56.986 --> 01:45:04.080
It's like a storm
that cuts a path it breaks

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:08.911
your will, it feels like that.

01:45:08.998 --> 01:45:19.400
You think you're lost, but
you're not lost on your own,

01:45:19.487 --> 01:45:28.234
you're not alone I
will stand by you,

01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:34.763
I will help you through, when
you've done all you can do,

01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:42.771
and you can't cope,
I will dry your eyes,

01:45:42.858 --> 01:45:49.386
I will fight your fight,
I will hold you tight,

01:45:49.473 --> 01:45:55.740
and I won't let you fall.

01:45:55.827 --> 01:45:58.743
Don't be afraid to fall.

01:45:58.830 --> 01:46:07.665
I'm right here to catch
you, I won't let you down.

01:46:07.752 --> 01:46:14.106
He won't get you down,
you're going to make it,

01:46:14.193 --> 01:46:22.027
yeah I know you can make it,
because I will stand by you,

01:46:22.114 --> 01:46:29.208
I will help you through, when
you've done all you can do,

01:46:29.295 --> 01:46:31.994
and you can't cope.

01:46:32.081 --> 01:46:40.002
And I will dry your eyes,
I will fight your fights,

01:46:40.089 --> 01:46:48.140
I will hold you tight,
and I won't let go.

01:46:54.016 --> 01:46:58.107
It's beautiful, man.

01:46:58.194 --> 01:47:01.066
Ain't it?

01:47:01.153 --> 01:47:02.153
Yeah.

01:47:10.902 --> 01:47:12.121
Tell me what's up?

01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:18.910
I made a promise to a friend.

01:47:18.997 --> 01:47:20.782
Friend?

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:23.698
You know, brother, not all
military casualties of war

01:47:23.785 --> 01:47:27.223
end up in hospitals and
national cemeteries.

01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:33.272
Some make it back, others make
it back, never make it home.

01:47:35.797 --> 01:47:37.146
I want to bring those vets home.

01:47:39.757 --> 01:47:43.631
Trained to save lives, Charlie.

01:47:43.718 --> 01:47:46.677
Suppose we need to
be doing just that.

01:48:45.693 --> 01:48:48.304
Man.

01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:49.697
He's here, man.

01:48:49.784 --> 01:48:51.263
I can feel it.

01:48:55.703 --> 01:48:59.968
522.

01:49:00.055 --> 01:49:04.929
525.

01:49:05.016 --> 01:49:11.327
426.

01:49:11.414 --> 01:49:16.288
450.

01:49:16.375 --> 01:49:22.251
380.

01:49:22.338 --> 01:49:32.434
390.

01:49:32.435 --> 01:50:20.744
390.

01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:24.095
First Sergeant
Samuel Gallegos,

01:50:24.182 --> 01:50:28.578
the 3rd infantry division's
first armored brigade combat

01:50:28.665 --> 01:50:29.665
team.

01:50:32.974 --> 01:50:38.066
I great friend, a great soldier.

01:50:40.938 --> 01:50:42.984
American through and through.

01:50:45.856 --> 01:50:47.771
And you.

01:50:47.858 --> 01:50:49.730
Sergeant, First Class Will--

01:50:49.817 --> 01:50:52.907
William Gardner.

01:50:52.994 --> 01:50:55.649
You too are a friend
at the highest order.

01:50:55.736 --> 01:50:58.608
A valiant soldier.

01:50:58.695 --> 01:51:04.788
Your service, your bravery,
your strength of character

01:51:04.875 --> 01:51:08.313
represents what
America stands for.

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.054
I salute you, and
it's a real honor

01:51:10.141 --> 01:51:12.535
to be able to thank you
for protecting our country.

01:51:12.622 --> 01:51:17.540
The land of the free,
the home of the brave.

01:51:17.627 --> 01:51:23.459
And your service to
which I will never forget

01:51:23.546 --> 01:51:25.766
And I thank you for yours.

01:51:25.853 --> 01:51:28.899
Much time spent in harm's way.

01:51:28.986 --> 01:51:30.771
Together, brother.

01:51:30.858 --> 01:51:32.033
Together, brother.

01:51:35.471 --> 01:51:37.342
Well, this is it, man.

01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:44.741
I hate goodbyes.

01:51:44.828 --> 01:51:46.569
They're the worst.

01:51:46.656 --> 01:51:49.180
But you're on the road to
reclaiming what's yours, Will.

01:51:49.267 --> 01:51:51.922
And that's a beautiful thing.

01:51:55.186 --> 01:51:58.276
Don't go soft on me.

01:51:58.363 --> 01:52:00.539
You helping those
returning soldiers.

01:52:00.626 --> 01:52:03.325
It's good for the heart.

01:52:03.412 --> 01:52:05.675
You know what else
would feed the heart?

01:52:05.762 --> 01:52:07.111
Tell me.

01:52:07.198 --> 01:52:09.810
You clocking
time with your son.

01:52:09.897 --> 01:52:11.812
I intend on it.

01:52:11.899 --> 01:52:13.509
Good, because I demand it.

01:52:13.596 --> 01:52:15.076
That an order?

01:52:15.163 --> 01:52:17.818
If it was, would you take it?

01:52:17.905 --> 01:52:19.863
Well, this one, I might.

01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:22.387
Be a first.

01:52:22.474 --> 01:52:24.650
Hey.

01:52:24.738 --> 01:52:27.175
You need them?

01:52:27.262 --> 01:52:28.262
Bite me.

01:52:31.701 --> 01:52:32.701
Atta boy.

01:53:12.046 --> 01:53:16.702
Take
this kiss upon the brow,

01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:24.232
and in parting from you
now, thus much let me avow.

01:53:24.319 --> 01:53:27.322
That you are not
wrong who deign,

01:53:27.409 --> 01:53:30.586
that my days have been a drain.

01:53:30.673 --> 01:53:39.160
Yet if hope has flown away, in
a night or in a day, in a vision

01:53:39.247 --> 01:53:47.429
or in none, is it
therefore the less gone?

01:53:47.516 --> 01:53:55.045
All that we see, or seem is
but a dream within a dream.

01:55:03.897 --> 01:55:05.202
Thank you, brother.

01:55:17.084 --> 01:55:27.136
California license
plate, 16, Juliet, 0100.

01:55:27.137 --> 01:55:35.232
California license
plate, 16, Juliet, 0100.

01:55:35.319 --> 01:55:42.848
I stand amid
the roar of a surf tormented

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:54.382
shore, and I hold within my
hand grains of a golden sand.

01:55:54.469 --> 01:55:56.210
Ma'am, could you
spare anything?

01:55:56.297 --> 01:55:58.952
I'm trying to get to New
Mexico to see my son.

01:55:59.039 --> 01:56:00.388
I'm so sorry.

01:56:00.475 --> 01:56:01.475
I'm sorry.

01:56:09.484 --> 01:56:11.442
Excuse me, sir could you
spare a couple dollars?

01:56:11.529 --> 01:56:14.315
I'm sorry, not today, pal.

01:56:14.402 --> 01:56:17.579
How few, yet how

01:56:17.666 --> 01:56:27.067
they creep through my fingers
to the deep while I weep.

01:56:27.154 --> 01:56:29.156
While I weep.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.534
Ghost.

01:56:59.621 --> 01:57:00.621
You got a letter, bro.

01:57:53.327 --> 01:58:00.899
God, can I not save one

01:58:00.986 --> 01:58:02.379
from the pitiless wave.

01:58:05.208 --> 01:58:13.999
Is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?
