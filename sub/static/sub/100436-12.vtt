WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:05.570
- Can you believe this,
Scully?

00:05.614 --> 00:07.181
Looks like we're
the only responsible people

00:07.224 --> 00:09.052
who show up on time anymore.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.662
- And they're always calling us
lazy, but where are they now?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.795
I don't see them.
- They're not here.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.623
- But you know who is?
Hitchcock and Scully.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.667
- The oafs.
- The bozos.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.495
- The--
- Idiots!

00:17.539 --> 00:19.497
What are you doing here?
The building's being fumigated.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.021
There were so many emails.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.023
- There were?
We didn't--

00:25.329 --> 00:27.418
- Lightweight.
- That's your takeaway?

00:47.482 --> 00:49.571
- It just doesn't seem
like he should be that fast

00:49.614 --> 00:52.356
for how big he is.
Gah, I hate Wario.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.097
- Peralta, my office.

00:54.141 --> 00:57.274
- Oh, Kevin's here.
And you both look so upset.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.102
Oh, no, did they stop
funding the arts?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.538
- They did, but that doesn't
matter anymore.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.584
Nothing does.
Cheddar has been kidnapped.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.412
- Someone took our fluffy boy.
- Oh, my God.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.196
What happened?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.676
- Well, Cheddar and I walked
to the bakery together,

01:07.719 --> 01:09.243
we shared a plain scone.
Then we went to the park,

01:09.286 --> 01:11.158
and I let him off leash.
He never came back.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.812
- Someone took our fluffy boy.
- Right, you mentioned that.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.466
Now, just to be clear,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.120
you didn't actually see someone
take him, right?

01:17.164 --> 01:18.687
So there's a chance
Cheddar just ran away.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.211
You know like some dogs do.
- Cheddar isn't some dog.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.561
He would never do that.
Someone took our--

01:23.605 --> 01:25.215
- Fluffy boy, yes,
I understand.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.825
- I need you
to drop everything.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.611
Nothing in the world
is important to me as this dog.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.178
- I wouldn't say nothing.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.570
For example,
you and I are very close.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.311
- We don't have time for this.
- Okay.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.139
- In kidnappings, the first
48 hours are the most crucial.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.228
- Right, and in dog years,
that's only seven hours.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.751
- Why would you say that?
This is why everyone

01:39.795 --> 01:41.579
prefers that dog to you.
- Everyone?

01:41.623 --> 01:43.190
Okay, look, I'm just saying

01:43.233 --> 01:44.582
that before we jump
to any conclusions...

01:44.626 --> 01:46.454
We should consider the fact

01:46.497 --> 01:48.238
that there's no actual proof
that someone kidnapped Cheddar.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.413
- It's a text.
It reads,

01:49.457 --> 01:50.632
"I have kidnapped your dog."

01:50.675 --> 01:51.633
- I see.
Well, that seems

01:51.676 --> 01:52.721
like pretty hard proof.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.418
That's good.
Good proof.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.334
- ♪ I said who's that mama
looking so cool ♪

01:57.378 --> 01:59.423
♪ I'm that mama
looking so cool ♪

01:59.467 --> 02:00.859
- Whoa?
-  What?

02:00.903 --> 02:02.339
Oh, sorry,
didn't see you there.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.862
- Yeah, that was clear.
What's going on?

02:03.906 --> 02:05.560
Why you dork dancing?
- A baby store in Dumbo

02:05.603 --> 02:08.258
is having a contest
to win a Snoog.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.868
- Who or what is a Snoog?

02:09.912 --> 02:12.697
- Are you kidding me?
It's only the best roller.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.308
It has the versatility
of Sporjule,

02:14.351 --> 02:16.440
the safety rating
of a Fajerb,

02:16.484 --> 02:19.530
and an even smoother ride
than the Kinderbuscht.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.184
- Are you having a stroke?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.577
- All the best strollers
are from Scandinavia,

02:22.620 --> 02:23.795
where they don't hate people
for having children.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.232
- I saw "Midsommar."

02:25.275 --> 02:26.581
Those people have
their own problems.

02:26.624 --> 02:27.669
- A Snoog is my dream stroller,

02:27.712 --> 02:29.497
but it's way too expensive.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.715
- What's the contest?

02:30.759 --> 02:32.500
- It's an endurance
competition.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.762
Everyone has to stand
with one hand on the stroller,

02:33.805 --> 02:35.285
and if you let go, you're out.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.808
Last person holding on wins.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.897
- Sounds painful.
Can I come?

02:38.941 --> 02:40.856
- Aww.
For moral support?

02:40.899 --> 02:42.336
- Sure.
That.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.251
- Okay, sir,

02:44.294 --> 02:45.904
the kidnapper should be calling
with his demands any minute.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.472
If we trace his location,
we can find your fuzzy boy.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.952
- Not fuzzy.
He's fluffy.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.519
- We don't know
what he is anymore.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.955
He could be fuzzy,
he could be anything.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.957
Raymond, he could be scruffy.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.654
- Now you've upset Kevin.
I hope you're happy.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.265
- Why would I be happy?

02:58.308 --> 02:59.353
I clearly just mixed up
fuzzy and fluffy.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.528
- "Just?"
You're fired.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.182
I want your shield
and your piece.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.792
- That seems a little extreme.
- Jake is right.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.489
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Just suspend him without pay.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.664
- Why did you ask for my help?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.188
- He's calling.
- Sir, remember,

03:08.231 --> 03:09.450
we need two minutes
for the trace.

03:09.493 --> 03:10.842
- Two minutes, understood.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.235
- So just keep him talking
and stay calm.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.889
- Peralta,
I'm in complete control.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.586
-  Hello?
- Shut your damn mouth.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.806
I'm the one talking here.
- Then this is over.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.329
- And he hung up.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.765
Well, that could've
gone better.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.550
- Come on, Terry.
You can pick up that paper.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.730
No, forget it.
It's only a first offence.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.427
- Is everything okay,
Lieutenant?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.255
You've been groaning
all morning.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.301
- I'm sore from my workout.
My muscles hurt so bad.

03:34.344 --> 03:37.608
Look.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

03:37.652 --> 03:40.785
- Come with me, friend.
I have exactly what you need.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.265
Bone broth!

03:42.309 --> 03:43.875
It's an old Boyle
family recipe.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.877
I drink it after every workout,
and I'm never sore.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.357
- Boyle, I don't think
we're maxing out

03:47.401 --> 03:48.619
at the same weight
at the gym.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.012
- Oh, Terry,
they're just numbers.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.970
You'll get there.

03:52.014 --> 03:55.278
- Hey, there you are, and oh,
my God what is happening?

03:55.322 --> 03:57.846
- I've gotten mad,
and now I'm getting even.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.761
- Okay, look, Sir,
I know you're upset,

03:59.804 --> 04:02.807
but you need to stay calm and
treat this like any other case.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.331
I mean, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

04:04.374 --> 04:05.897
but now is not the time
to go all John Wick.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.421
- Who's that?
A friend of yours?

04:07.464 --> 04:08.900
-  I wish,
but he's not a real person.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.467
He's a movie assassin
that goes nuts

04:10.511 --> 04:12.034
when someone
messes with his dog.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.036
- Then call me "John Wicks,"
'cause I'm about to go nuts.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.995
- It's "Wick," singular,
and you already did go nuts.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.563
It cost us the trace, remember?
Look, I need you to focus.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.391
The kidnapper texted
his demands.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.001
- How much does the bastard
want for my little doggy?

04:23.045 --> 04:24.699
- Oh, that's just it.
He doesn't want money.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.570
He requested all the files
we worked from May 2004.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.311
It's a lead.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.791
He's gotta be connected
to one of those cases somehow.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.314
- Interesting.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.402
You know what else
is interesting?

04:32.446 --> 04:33.751
- Hmm?
- Grenades.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.579
- Just please, stop it.
I'm gonna take Kevin

04:35.623 --> 04:37.320
to the park where Cheddar was
kidnapped and look for clues.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.843
I need you to stay here,
go through those files,

04:38.887 --> 04:40.715
and put together a list
of potential suspects.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.760
Can you do that?
- Okay, fine.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.893
I'll go through the files.
- Great.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.461
- You realize I can't leave

04:47.504 --> 04:48.853
until you put
the grenades back, right?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.725
- Oh, but you let John Wicks
have grenades?

04:50.768 --> 04:52.596
- It's "Wick."
Singular.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.989
Just put 'em back.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.211
- Okay, Kevin, we need
to recreate your morning

04:59.255 --> 05:00.343
and see
if we can find some clues.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.040
- All right, Cheddar and I
entered

05:02.084 --> 05:03.346
on the east side of the park
over past those trees--

05:03.390 --> 05:04.869
oh, how he loved those trees.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.262
Jake, I don't know
if I can do this.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.046
- Yeah, you can do this,
I'm right here with you.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.221
We're gonna get through it
together.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.267
Now let's go.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.140
- Oh, hey, Kev, bud,
couldn't help but notice

05:15.184 --> 05:16.751
that when I said, "let's go,"
you didn't go.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.143
You stayed here
and stared at that bench.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.406
- Cheddar loved benches.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.146
He'd run up to them.
Sniff their legs.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.713
Paw at them with his--

05:22.757 --> 05:24.149
- Paws, sure,
that's what you paw with.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.847
-  I'm sorry.
This is impossible.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.239
Everything I see
reminds me of Cheddar.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.503
The grass, the asphalt,
squirrels--

05:29.546 --> 05:31.374
Cheddar loved squirrels.
- Oh, stop.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.811
- He loves to chase them.
I suppose I should say loved.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.073
He'd never get there.
He's like--

05:35.117 --> 05:36.858
- Eeyh, Kevin, stop, all right?

05:36.901 --> 05:38.729
We need to get over to that
gate and recreate your morning,

05:38.773 --> 05:40.209
and if seeing all these things
is too much,

05:40.252 --> 05:42.385
then just focus only on me.
- Okay.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.082
- All right,
stare straight into my eyes.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.388
- Very good, I will stare
straight into your eyes.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.085
- Okay.
Oh, wow.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.392
Piercing.
Huh, okay, so let's do this.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.526
And we are heading to the east
gate, we're doing great.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.962
- This is working.
I can do this.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.355
- Here we go.
- I'm doing it.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.747
- You're looking away.
- No, I'm not.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.140
- Stop looking away.
- I'm not.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.271
- Don't look away.
- But I see leaves.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.795
- No!
- Cheddar loved

06:00.838 --> 06:02.013
playing in leaves.
Didn't matter what kind.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.450
Oak, maple, elm.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.801
- Wait, I hate to cut you off,
but look what I found.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.150
Security camera.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.412
- Cheddar loved
security cameras.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.848
- How is that possible?

06:10.892 --> 06:16.245
- Oh, Rosa, there she is.
The Snoog!

06:16.288 --> 06:18.421
Look at those sexy lines.

06:18.465 --> 06:21.076
Oh, I just wanna get
behind that thing and push.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.382
- Aw, man,
you're grossing me out.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.906
What is Teddy doing here?

06:24.949 --> 06:26.864
- Teddy?
- Oh, my gosh, hey Amy.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.475
- Right, boring ex-boyfriend
Teddy.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.215
Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Rosa.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.782
- What are you doing here?
You promised you would stop

06:31.826 --> 06:33.436
showing up places
to propose to me.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.133
- Quit flattering yourself.
I only did that four times.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.874
Also, I'm taken now.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.399
I got married, last year,
in the spiciest little city.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.357
Phoenix.
It was very posh.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.967
We served a flight
of large batch Pilsners.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.404
I don't know if you remember,
but I love--

06:44.447 --> 06:46.318
both: Pilsners.
- Yeah, we remember.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.059
- Yeah, long story short,
we're pregnant now,

06:48.103 --> 06:50.018
and I'ma--I'ma try and win
this sexy little number.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.323
- Oh, God, is that
what I sound like?

06:51.367 --> 06:52.542
- Yep.
- Excuse me.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.935
Are you here
for the competition?

06:53.978 --> 06:55.545
- Uh, yes, hi.
I'm Teddy Ramos.

06:55.589 --> 06:59.027
Took my wife's last name.
Very brave.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.202
- He's the worst.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.856
- Hi, I'm Amy Santiago.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.335
- I am so sorry,

07:03.379 --> 07:05.425
but pregnant women
aren't allowed to compete.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.905
Not after what happened
last year.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.127
- Are you gonna say
what happened?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.433
- It's part of the settlement.
We can't.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.825
- Okay.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.567
Well, uh, good news:
I'm not pregnant!

07:17.611 --> 07:21.528
I just had a huge lunch.
- I'm so sorry, I just can't.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.181
- All right,
I'll compete for her.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.531
- What?
You will?

07:24.574 --> 07:26.315
But I know you think
these strollers are dumb.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.404
- They are, but I can't let
that boring bastard win.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.059
- So we decided to paint
the baby room white.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.582
- I mean, you used to have sex
with him.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.366
- I know.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.413
- Charles, this Boyle
bone broth is incredible.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.111
I'm not sore at all anymore.
- I told you it works.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.374
The Boyles used to drink it
during potato digging season

07:42.418 --> 07:44.028
to keep everyone healthy
in the furrows.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.161
- You know, I bet we could sell
this stuff.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.032
- You really think so?

07:48.076 --> 07:49.164
We can call our company
"The Bone Boys."

07:49.207 --> 07:51.209
No!
"More Bone, Less Moan."

07:51.253 --> 07:53.298
No!
"Workplace Bone Buds."

07:53.342 --> 07:54.604
That's the one.
I'm registering it.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.432
- Ewh, we can name
the company later.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.478
Anyway, I know just who
to pitch this to.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
My buddy who invented
Muscle Malt.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.133
This is great!

08:02.177 --> 08:03.526
- We're the perfect partners.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.136
When it comes to cooking,
you got me.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.399
When it comes to being ripped,
you also have me.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.879
And you have
a little connection.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.577
We're gonna be rich.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.056
- Sir, we're back.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.580
Find anything
in the case files?

08:13.623 --> 08:15.669
- Yes, most of them were
useless, but one caught my eye.

08:15.712 --> 08:19.107
On May 15th, 2004 detectives
arrested Frank Kingston,

08:19.150 --> 08:20.543
leader of the 16th Street Gang.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.937
Thanks to the testimony
of confidential informant,

08:22.980 --> 08:26.549
Kingston served 16 years.
He just got out last month.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.377
- And you think he wants
the file to figure out

08:28.420 --> 08:30.248
which one of his guys
turned on him to get revenge.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.250
It's a Vendetta.
-  Vendetta.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.687
- Sure.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.211
- So now I know who the
sumbitch is who took my dog.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.517
The only problem is,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.519
I have no idea where
to find that sumbitch.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.433
- Well, Raymond, I think we can
help you find that sumbitch.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.913
Jake?

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
- Sumbitch.
We all got to say it.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.482
Let me show you what we found:
A security camera grabbed

08:46.526 --> 08:48.658
some footage of Cheddar being
picked up and put into a car

08:48.702 --> 08:50.573
which was registered to
an anonymous shell company

08:50.617 --> 08:53.445
on Dean Street.
We can be there in 15 minutes.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.360
- That's weird.
It's sunny outside.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.275
- Why's that weird?

08:57.319 --> 08:59.016
- Because a storm
is about to rain down

08:59.060 --> 09:00.452
on that punk.

09:00.496 --> 09:03.238
- Oh, my God, I fell for it,
and I loved it.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.109
All right, let's gear up.
Kevin, you stay here,

09:05.153 --> 09:07.590
and don't worry.
We're gonna get your dog back.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.723
- So we did not
get your dog back.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.552
Unfortunately, he wasn't here.
No, no, no.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.118
I think Captain Holt's
taking it really well.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.208
- So we'll see you soon.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.732
- Wow, five hours.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.647
This is the most exciting
contest we've had.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.518
Of course, the incident
last year was exciting,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.477
but we all know how that ended.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.001
- No.
We don't.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.306
- Right.
Because of the gag order.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.353
Are you sure you wanna
keep doing this, Rosa?

09:31.396 --> 09:33.268
You really don't have to.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.096
- My feet hurt a little, but
I can go as long as it takes.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.401
- We're having a great time
back here.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.577
I was just telling
my buddy Reggie here

09:37.620 --> 09:38.708
about this great salsa
that I make.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.275
It's so mild
you barely taste it.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.972
- That's it.
I can't take any more.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.365
I'm out.
- Bye, Reggie.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.019
I'll send you that article
about mailboxes.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.542
- Please don't!
- Oh, my God,

09:46.586 --> 09:49.023
Teddy is boring
people out of the competition,

09:49.066 --> 09:52.287
and he doesn't even realize it.
Can't let him get to you, Rosa.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.984
It's fine, I can handle boring.
We're friends.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
- Ooh, guys,
you will never believe

09:55.682 --> 09:58.989
who I saw at Bush Gardens last
summer: my neighbor.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.774
Yeah?
Just walking around.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.341
- The kidnapper said he would
call with drop instructions

10:03.385 --> 10:06.301
at 8:00 a.m.
It is now----8:01.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.737
Cheddar's dead.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.521
- Cheddar is not dead.
It's just one minute.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.088
Perhaps the kidnapper's watch
is slow.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.786
- Oh, dear God,
if his watch is slow,

10:12.829 --> 10:14.788
there's no telling what else
this psychopath is capable of.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.529
- Raymond, Cheddar is fine.
He's coming back to us,

10:17.573 --> 10:20.402
and that is why I bought a new
GPS tag to put on his collar.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.664
- Thank you, Kevin.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.492
At least some of us
are thinking clearly.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.668
- Yes, crystal clear.
In fact I bought 5 GPS tags.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.801
One for his collar
and one for each arm and leg.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.629
I'm going to make bracelets
to put them on,

10:29.672 --> 10:32.066
and I'll never lose
my Cheddar again.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
- Okay, a little unsettling,
but I like your positivity.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.504
- Three minutes after 8:00.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.332
This man is unhinged.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.377
You said you'd call at 8:00.
- My watch is slow.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.683
Put the files
on a flash drive,

10:40.727 --> 10:42.598
and have your husband
bring it

10:42.642 --> 10:44.078
to the 9th Street entrance
of Prospect Park at noon.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
- My husband?
No.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.385
I'm not involving him in this.
I'll bring them myself.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.170
- I don't trust you.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.693
I told you not to look for me,
but you did.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.087
Send your husband
or the deal is off.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.697
- Clearly,
we're not doing this.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.264
- No, it's fine.
We can just alter the files

10:56.307 --> 10:57.439
and give him fakes.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.136
He'll never know.
- It's not that.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.703
It's that I refuse to put Kevin
in harm's way.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.401
- Understood,
but I think maybe I have a way

11:03.445 --> 11:05.099
to put Kevin in danger

11:05.142 --> 11:06.666
without putting Kevin
in danger.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.145
Well, hello there Raymond.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.712
It's me, Kevin!

11:09.756 --> 11:11.583
-  And I am
Detective Jacob Peralta.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.673
- We didn't have anything else
to wear so we just switched.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.457
- He understands.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.549
- Okay, if we're gonna pull
this off,

11:20.592 --> 11:21.985
we need to teach you

11:22.029 --> 11:24.335
how to move, talk, and act
exactly like Kevin.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.729
- In other words we have
a "Pygmalion" situation.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.079
- Exactly, a "pig mailman"
situation.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.690
- Raymond.
- It'll be okay.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.126
- What'll be okay?
- Let's get started.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.867
- Yes, let's get started!
- It's getting worse.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.216
- Spot on, Kevin.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.653
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.786
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.223
- No, you're too excited.
The warbler's a common bird.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.790
- Ah.
- And then I said,

11:43.833 --> 11:46.227
"Which 'Metamorphosis'?
Kafka or Ovid?"

11:46.270 --> 11:48.272
- He loves it.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.013
He loves it.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.319
- So that's the joke.
Now, you tell it.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.103
- Oh, okay,

11:53.147 --> 11:55.236
so a professor walks in
to a rare books collection--

11:55.279 --> 11:57.673
- No, you've ruined it.
Now it's not funny.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.762
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.069
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.853
- Ugh, not excited enough.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.768
They may be common,
but they're still birds.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.248
- At the 92nd Street Y,

12:07.291 --> 12:09.076
I had a wonderful symposium
on just that topic.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.817
- That's it.
You're getting it.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.383
- Ah, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.995
- Don't say "cool,"
instead say "indeed."

12:15.038 --> 12:16.779
- Oh, indeed, indeed,
indeed, indeed, indeed.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
It's weird.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.088
Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.872
- Yes!

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
That's the right level
of excitement for such a bird.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
You captured
the essence of Kevin.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.095
You've done it.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.966
- Correction,
I've accomplished it.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.620
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.100
- Indeed, indeed, indeed...

12:33.143 --> 12:34.754
all: Indeed, indeed, indeed,
indeed, indeed.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.972
- It's growing on me.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.975
- Oh, my God,
Rosa.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.934
I can't believe
you're still here.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.805
And I can't believe Teddy
looks so normal.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.111
- I'm 'onna win you that Snoo.
Slog.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.329
Snat--whatever,
my brain is broken,

12:45.373 --> 12:47.114
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.811
- You've only been doing
the competition for one night.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.813
- I mean, you're allowed
to not sleep for other reasons.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.773
- Okay, I got you a coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.818
Just need to put my left hand
on the stroller.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.430
My right hand grabs the cup.
My mouth do the sippin'.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.302
- What's happening?

13:01.345 --> 13:03.739
- My broken brain won't talk
to my body, so I'm doing it.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.958
Blink.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.220
- Rosa, you don't
have to do this.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.917
You can stop.
- Snarl at Amy.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.092
Teddy and I
are the only ones left.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.833
I'm 'onna win this

13:10.877 --> 13:12.661
no matter how much he talks
about light rail systems.

13:12.704 --> 13:13.967
- Ooh, you should ride the one
in Akron, by the way.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.707
Very little noise.
- Oh, my God.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.318
- Enough about light rails.
Let's talk trams.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.841
Amusement parks get it.
- I can't, I can't, I can't...

13:18.885 --> 13:20.147
If more cities adopted
amusement park...

13:20.190 --> 13:21.452
- I can't, I can't.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.976
Oh, put your hands
over your ears.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.281
- Oh no, wait, Rosa!

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
- Hands are off.
We have a winner!

13:26.022 --> 13:27.328
- Me?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.460
I won a stroller?
Whoo-hoo!

13:29.504 --> 13:31.811
- Oh, I see what I did wrong.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.377
- It's okay.
Come on, let's get you home.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.988
- Excuse me.
Amy.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.294
You can have the stroller
for the right price.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.730
- Okay, how much?

13:40.776 --> 13:42.169
- Amy Santiago,
will you marry me?

13:42.212 --> 13:43.779
- No!

13:43.823 --> 13:45.172
- Okay, I'm approaching
the drop site.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.347
I don't see anything unusual.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.001
- We have eyes on you.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.177
Just be natural.
- Indeed, I will.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.875
Oh, look,
a yellow crested warbler.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.398
- Very good.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.922
- He's calling.
Wait, Kevin,

13:55.965 --> 13:57.184
we didn't go over
how you answer the phone.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.881
- There isn't time.
Just answer.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.187
- Okay.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.971
You've reached
Professor Kevin Cozner.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.408
Please start speaking
when I finish this sentence.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.889
- Pick up the book
on the bench and head south.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.022
- He hung up.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.024
And he had me pick up a copy
of "The Tempest."

14:11.067 --> 14:12.721
- "Tempest?"
Oh, no, Raymond.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.375
Do you know what's happening
in the park today?

14:14.418 --> 14:17.247
- The Shakespeare Festival
which will be attended by--

14:17.291 --> 14:18.858
- Guys, I'm in a sea of Kevins.

14:20.947 --> 14:24.037
- Okay, between us,
I think we made enough broth.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.386
- Did you edit the presentation
like I asked?

14:25.429 --> 14:26.909
- You mean did I remove

14:26.953 --> 14:28.345
the tasteful photos
of me stretching?

14:28.389 --> 14:30.957
- They weren't tasteful!
You were in a thong.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.352
All right, Muscle Malt Kenneth
is on his way up.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.790
Hey, I just wanna say,
no matter how this turns out,

14:38.834 --> 14:40.357
it was really fun
working on this with you.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.229
- Aw, Terry,
it's gotta turn out well.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.449
I invested $11,000 in it.
- $11,000?!

14:45.493 --> 14:47.887
It only costs 30 bucks
to make the broth!

14:47.930 --> 14:49.453
- Yeah, but it cost $11,000

14:49.497 --> 14:51.934
to buy the domain name
"workplacebonebuds.com."

14:51.978 --> 14:53.370
I am all in.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.416
- Boyle, why in the world
would you do that?

14:55.459 --> 14:58.419
You are such a--
an amazing business partner.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.942
Kenneth, I'd like you to meet

14:59.986 --> 15:01.509
my amazing business partner
Charles.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.989
- Hey.
- Hello.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.947
I'm excited to see
what you guys have here.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
- Well, take a sip
and feel the soreness

15:06.470 --> 15:08.124
start to drain away.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.954
- Mmm.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.825
It's good.
Very tasty.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.480
- Not only is it delicious,
it's high in amino acids,

15:16.524 --> 15:17.960
and low in sodium.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.266
- Well,
not exactly low in sodium.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.876
It definitely has salt in it.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.922
- Not in the batch I made.
I left it out.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.488
Terry doesn't like
to get all bloaty.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.838
- You left out the salt?
That stops the fermentation.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.101
The salt keeps it stable.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.407
- Oh, ah!
- God, what is happening?

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
They're all gonna blow!
Take cover!

15:36.631 --> 15:38.285
- So, uh, do we have a deal?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.462
- Still waiting
for instructions, over.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.116
- Wait, we don't have eyes
on you.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.552
- Kevin, do you see Jake?
- Yes, he's right there.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.380
Oh, no,
that's a different gentlemen

15:46.423 --> 15:48.295
wearing a handsome jacket.
Everyone is so well dressed.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.210
- Peralta, head for
the north gate.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.125
We're having trouble
finding you.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.344
- All right, Professor, I'm
assuming you're wearing a wire.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.911
- A what?
A--huh?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.260
Ah, yes, a wire.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.001
My husband asked me
to wear that.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
- We lost comms.
Something happened.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.441
Cheddar!
Uh, my fluffy boy!

16:04.485 --> 16:06.269
I've missed you so.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.010
- All right, put up your hands.
I'm gonna tap you down.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.490
- There's no need for that.
I have the drive.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.971
Just take it.
- Thanks.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.494
I'm still gonna pat you down.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.887
- Be my guest, but you're not
gonna find anything.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.978
- Here's a gun.
- Whoops.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.023
- And another gun.
- I forgot about that one too.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.156
- So, the Professor's got
two guns on him,

16:23.199 --> 16:25.071
and he's wearing a fake beard.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.637
- Oh, please don't rip it off.
It hurts so much.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.161
- I think the Professor's
actually a cop.

16:29.553 --> 16:30.990
- Something tells me
I should check that drive.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.121
There's a laptop
in the front seat.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.514
Get it.
If these files

16:33.557 --> 16:35.168
aren't the real deal,
you and the dog are dead.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.170
- Oh, no need to worry.
Because everything

16:37.213 --> 16:39.172
is on the level
and will be completely fine.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.391
- Cheddar, go!

16:41.435 --> 16:42.958
Go, boy!

16:43.002 --> 16:45.134
- Hey cop.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.657
- Would you like
to buy a laptop?

16:49.443 --> 16:51.706
- There's no sign
of Peralta out here.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.360
Did you hear anything
on the wire?

16:53.403 --> 16:54.535
- No, it never came back on.
Do you think he's okay?

16:54.578 --> 16:55.753
- Shh!
- What?

16:55.797 --> 16:57.233
- Do you hear?
- Yes, I do.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.539
That's the jingle
of Cheddar's collar.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.888
- And that's his bark!

17:02.412 --> 17:05.372
Oh, that's our fluffy boy!

17:05.415 --> 17:07.722
Good dog.
Good dog.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.767
- Oh, Mr. Cheddar,
how I've missed you.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.465
- We both have.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.032
- I'm putting that GPS tag
on your collar immediately.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.556
Oh, damn it, it's not here.
I'm wearing Peralta's pants.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.253
Ugh,
and now my hands are sticky.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.300
- Wait, Peralta's wearing
your pants which means--

17:20.343 --> 17:22.041
- He doesn't have sticky hands.
- Yes, but also

17:22.084 --> 17:24.434
he has the GPS tracker.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.917
- Hey, so, given the fact that
you haven't slept in forever,

17:28.960 --> 17:30.571
I feel
like I should drive you home.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.007
- I'm not going home.
I'm going out.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.704
- What?
Really?

17:33.748 --> 17:35.228
What is your life?
- It's pretty good actually.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.751
- Huh.
- By the way,

17:36.794 --> 17:38.405
I'm sorry that I didn't win you
that stroller.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.929
- No, no, no, you were right.
I don't need a Snoog.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.365
It's way too fancy.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.801
It is stupid.
- It's not stupid.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.281
I said you didn't need it

17:45.325 --> 17:46.543
because I already bought you
a stroller

17:46.587 --> 17:48.067
for your shower
this weekend,

17:48.110 --> 17:49.633
and it's just--isn't as fancy,
and I felt bad.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.635
- Rosa, I would love
any stroller you got me

17:51.679 --> 17:54.421
because it came from you.
- It's a Luftroller.

17:55.813 --> 17:59.643
- Oh, that is--
that is a great stroller.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.645
- I got you a gift receipt.
- Thank you so much.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.430
- I cleaned up
as much as I could,

18:03.473 --> 18:04.822
but I think that couch

18:04.866 --> 18:06.433
is gonna smell like bone broth
for a while.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.956
So did you talk to your friend?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.871
Any chance
he'll reconsider investing?

18:09.914 --> 18:11.612
- Yeah, that's not happening.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.918
He said that was
the most scared he's ever been,

18:13.962 --> 18:15.746
and he was on that plane
that landed on the Hudson.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.965
- I guess that's it.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.446
I'm never gonna make
my $11,000 back.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.883
- Actually, I called
another guy from my gym.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.450
He wants to buy the domain

18:23.493 --> 18:25.060
workplacebonebuds.com
off of you.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.540
- That's amazing!

18:26.583 --> 18:27.976
I can't believe you found
someone else

18:28.019 --> 18:30.413
who runs a bone broth company
with a coworker.

18:30.457 --> 18:31.980
What are the odds?

18:32.023 --> 18:33.982
- No, obviously he wants
to make a website

18:34.025 --> 18:36.115
that helps people hook up
with their coworkers.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.073
- I don't see it.
- Charles.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.467
It's called
workplacebonebuds.com.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.990
- All I hear
is friendship and broth.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.687
But yeah, I mean he wants
to burn his money,

18:43.731 --> 18:45.341
I'll light the match.
Yeah, tell him to call me.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.126
His loss.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.779
- So what's your plan here,
Kingston?

18:48.823 --> 18:50.433
You gonna torture me?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.956
You gonna put my beard back on
and rip it off again?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.610
- No, I'm gonna cut off
each one of your fingers

18:53.654 --> 18:55.003
until you tell me
who the rat is.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.700
- I see.
Well that's bad news,

18:56.744 --> 18:58.572
because I don't know
who the rat is,

18:58.615 --> 19:00.487
and I need all my fingers
if I'm gonna beat Wario.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.705
- You can't beat Wario?
- You can?

19:01.749 --> 19:03.142
How do you do it?
- It's simple.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.534
When he's approaching,
you just tap the--

19:04.578 --> 19:06.014
Damn it!

19:06.057 --> 19:07.624
Motion detector!
- I'm sorry, what do you tap?

19:07.668 --> 19:09.626
- Get up, let's go!
- Kingston!

19:09.670 --> 19:11.976
What do you tap?
What do you tap?!

19:12.020 --> 19:14.849
- NYPD!
NYPD!

19:14.892 --> 19:17.068
- Split up!
Cover the exits!

19:19.375 --> 19:20.942
Freeze!
- Captain!

19:20.985 --> 19:23.510
Captain!
- He's not getting away!

19:23.553 --> 19:26.556
He took my dog!
- Oh, my God.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.558
It's happening!

19:35.870 --> 19:38.133
Aah!

19:41.919 --> 19:44.183
Oh, I see you have a knife.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.750
But what you need
is an umbrella.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.578
- Tell him why.
Tell him why!

19:48.622 --> 19:53.670
- 'Cause there's a storm
gonna rain down on you, punk.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.070
- Ooh.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.641
My goodness.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.435
- Awh!
- Ooo-hoo-hoo!

20:29.576 --> 20:34.407
- You took
the wrong fluffy boy!

20:39.977 --> 20:41.109
He's done.
Cuff him.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.241
- Yes, sir.

20:44.199 --> 20:47.681
That was the single coolest
thing that has ever happened.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.117
- Relax, Peralta.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.119
That wasn't even the coolest
thing I've ever done.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.599
- What have you done
that's cooler?

20:52.642 --> 20:53.948
- It was the '80s.
It was nothing, I mean,

20:53.991 --> 20:55.471
they made a movie out of it,
but whatever.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.646
- What?
What movie?

20:56.690 --> 20:58.126
- I don't remember the title.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.433
Uh, there was a crime
on a plane, I was a passenger.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.826
- Was it "Passenger 57?"
- I honestly don't know.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.567
- It had to have been.
Just say it was that.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.221
- You know, Peralta,
sometimes I don't understand

21:06.265 --> 21:08.179
the words
coming out of your mouth.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.790
- Oh, my God,
was it "Rush Hour?"

21:09.833 --> 21:11.226
- What?
No.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.620
You know what?
I'm too old for this crap.

21:13.663 --> 21:17.580
- It was "Lethal Weapon?!"
Sir, are you Murtaugh?!

21:19.016 --> 21:21.715
Does that make me Riggs?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.586
I'm Riggs!

21:23.630 --> 21:25.588
- Fremulon.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.677
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
