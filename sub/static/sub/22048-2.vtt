00:39.460 --> 00:40.420
Hi.

00:40.620 --> 00:41.880
Hi friend.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.300
Are you in Oslo now?

00:43.500 --> 00:48.280
No, my flight from Geneva is
booked so I'm here until tomorrow.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
No...

00:49.720 --> 00:52.720
But I'm in Oslo tomorrow afternoon.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.340
But I'm going to the cabin tomorrow.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.300
Oh yeah, that's true!

00:57.440 --> 00:59.160
Where was it you're going?

01:00.960 --> 01:05.040
To Ingrid's cabin,
with Igrid and Sara.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.220
So nice! Who will drive you guys?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.040
No, we'll take the bus.

01:10.580 --> 01:16.720
The bus? Can't you wait?
If you wait a day, I can drive you.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.600
But I've been looking forward
to the cabin for over a month.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.720
Yeah, I know.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.560
But I'm coming home on Saturday.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.020
Yeah... On Saturday I-

01:36.400 --> 01:39.920
It looks like I'll
leave again on Friday night.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.320
Do you have enough money?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.580
Yeah.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.900
I'll wire you a little bit extra,
so you guys can have fun.

01:57.120 --> 01:57.960
Thanks.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.820
Okay, have a good trip
and say hi to Igrid and Sara.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.980
Yeah, thanks. You too.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.880
Okay, we'll talk.
-We will. Take care!

03:14.360 --> 03:16.680
Sorry, sorry!
-Isak!

03:21.900 --> 03:25.800
Should we send him home?
-Okay, we'll just do that.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.920
What time is it even?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.860
Eh, ten past nine.
-Ten past nine?!

03:53.340 --> 03:55.500
Why did you come so fucking early?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
Play "I'm Yours".
-No!

04:28.360 --> 04:32.860
You only know gay songs.
-Shut up! Is that a gay song?

04:41.780 --> 04:42.800
Who is it?

04:46.360 --> 04:47.340
Jonas?

04:48.140 --> 04:49.000
Elias.

04:49.460 --> 04:50.680
Your new lover?

04:51.540 --> 04:52.760
What are you talking about?

04:52.940 --> 04:59.560
You know what I'm talking about.
You ran after him the entire school day.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.560
Hello?

05:00.680 --> 05:06.440
Oh, Elias? I'm so happy to be talking to you.
I think I love you.

05:06.540 --> 05:13.040
Maybe we can get married. Then we'll go on our
honeymoon in March and live alone for the rest of our lives.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.420
Love each other.

05:26.620 --> 05:30.000
What's the deal with Jonas and Ingrid?
-Huh?

05:32.960 --> 05:34.240
You heard what I said.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.520
You have to ask Jonas.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.760
Why do you ask?

05:52.840 --> 05:54.560
I saw a notification on his phone.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.000
I know that you know something.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.720
Can't you just say it?
I promise I won't get angry.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.840
I promise I won't
tell Jonas you said something.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.300
They text?

06:14.620 --> 06:15.660
Maybe a little.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.700
In which stadium does the
English Cup Final take place? -Wembley.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.960
That's correct.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.100
What bone in your body
gets broken most often? -Collarbone.

07:06.260 --> 07:06.960
Yep.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.300
Who was the first
president of the USA?

07:11.540 --> 07:12.880
George Washington.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.540
Okay, Eva. Who was the
first female Prime Minister of Norway?

07:18.540 --> 07:19.680
I'm not joining.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.620
She can't answer.

07:24.460 --> 07:28.500
I do, I just don't want to join.
-Just answer, then we won't nag anymore.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.780
I didn't hear the question.
-Who was Norway's first female Prime Minister?

07:35.500 --> 07:36.880
Erna Solberg.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.280
Fuck you guys!

07:42.160 --> 07:43.520
Why are you so pissed?

07:47.980 --> 07:50.660
I'm not pissed. I just think
Trivial Pursuit is boring.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.140
Okay?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.800
What do you want to play, then?
Something that isn't so boring.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.420
Nothing. I want to read.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.700
Come on! You must
want to do something.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.040
Okay.

08:03.860 --> 08:07.360
I want to play "My ship is loaded with.."
-Then we'll play "My ship".

08:07.760 --> 08:08.800
I'll start.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.380
My ship is loaded with Ingrid.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.200
My ship is loaded with Erna Solberg.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.860
Okay, eh.. My ship is loaded with insects.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.860
My ship is loaded with ice.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.360
My ship is loaded with-

08:36.840 --> 08:38.680
What the fuck?
What was that?

08:38.680 --> 08:40.180
Shit. Fuck.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.560
Did you see it?
-No.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.560
So weird.
-Really strange.

08:46.740 --> 08:47.680
It's..

08:52.460 --> 08:53.840
Hello?

09:09.280 --> 09:10.700
Hi!
-The fuck?

09:11.060 --> 09:12.900
Elias!
-Jonas!

09:14.040 --> 09:16.520
What's up?
-You came!

09:16.520 --> 09:19.620
Of course I came!

09:19.620 --> 09:24.080
How did you find it?
-Embedded GPS in my brain.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.100
No, I asked a guy
at the parking space up there.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.860
Hello.
-Hello.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.740
Hello.
-Hi.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.060
So this is where you guys hang?
-Really cool.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.400
Good atmosphere at least.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
It'll be a party.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.640
Where should I sleep?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.560
In the bedroom with Isak.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.840
I'll sleep with the gay guy?
-Why is everyone calling me gay?

09:58.040 --> 09:59.720
You are gay.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.000
He's joking. Have a little humor.

10:14.660 --> 10:18.760
What? He asked if he
could come. What should I have said?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.560
That was really awesome.
-Yeah, it works now.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.660
Do you need help?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.700
You set the table?
Yes.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.800
Hm, looks good. Can I taste it?

11:28.540 --> 11:29.580
Good.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.020
We're gonna have a smoke.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.220
Smoke?

11:38.220 --> 11:40.400
Yeah, a smoke.
-You don't even smoke.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.040
Come on, it's a party.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.400
Yeah, it's a party.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.120
You really don't need help?
-No.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.420
Food's ready!

13:10.360 --> 13:11.760
Jonas!

13:29.440 --> 13:30.320
Seriously?

13:32.120 --> 13:34.680
Not funny.
-It's a little funny.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.100
You're able to
help yourself, aren't you?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.520
Why are you so pissed all the time?

14:07.980 --> 14:10.720
I'm pissed because
you're behaving like a complete jerk.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.940
Jerk? What did I do?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.740
Say what I did!

14:17.220 --> 14:20.420
You invited loads of people
to a cabin trip that was just supposed to be us.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.600
Two guys?
-Yes.

14:22.160 --> 14:27.100
You change personalities
once Elias is around.

14:27.340 --> 14:33.640
And you're texting with Ingrid behind my back,
when you know how much of a bitch she is to me!

14:33.640 --> 14:36.380
Ingrid? I'm not going behind your
back talking to Ingrid!

14:36.380 --> 14:40.340
What did she say I did?
-You think I don't know you text her?

14:42.120 --> 14:44.240
I texted with her about French.
-About French?

14:44.240 --> 14:47.440
During fall break?
-We have homework for after the break.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.920
Yeah okay, if it's about French,
I can read the messages.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.960
Why would you read my messages?
-You can read my messages!

14:52.960 --> 14:55.200
I don't need to read your messages.
-Why?

14:55.200 --> 14:58.860
You have to read my messages
so we can trust each other? -Yeah.

14:58.860 --> 15:01.040
That's ridiculous!
-Jonas!

15:01.640 --> 15:03.760
This is ridiculous!

15:04.200 --> 15:08.180
What the fuck? Why do
you think that I talk to Ingrid?

15:08.680 --> 15:11.580
It's true, right?
-Yeah, about school!

15:11.580 --> 15:15.180
Can I see your messages?
-I already told you it's ridiculous!

15:15.340 --> 15:17.060
Why don't you trust me?
