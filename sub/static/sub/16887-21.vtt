00:00.300 --> 00:01.882
<i>Hey, I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>Here's a couple of things</i>

00:01.934 --> 00:03.442
<i>that you might need to know,</i>
<i>or maybe you just forgot.</i>

00:04.253 --> 00:05.420
I'm not who you think I am.

00:05.488 --> 00:06.822
You're Orion.

00:06.889 --> 00:08.007
<i>My father invented the Intersect.</i>

00:08.224 --> 00:09.691
No hug for your old partner?

00:09.759 --> 00:11.960
I'm been looking for
you for a long time.

00:12.028 --> 00:14.129
<i>Put him on the helicopter,</i>
<i>and kill his son.</i>

00:14.197 --> 00:15.997
I overheard them say
that they're moving your father

00:16.065 --> 00:17.432
to a place called Black Rock.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.167
<i>Black Rock is a code name</i>

00:19.235 --> 00:20.702
<i>for a secret FULCRUM base</i>
<i>in Barstow.</i>

00:20.770 --> 00:22.070
I'm shutting down this project.

00:22.138 --> 00:23.739
Chuck's going into lockdown.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.375
Operation Moron is over.

00:26.442 --> 00:27.642
They're gonna
take you underground.

00:27.710 --> 00:30.312
We have to run. Your
dad is still out there.

00:30.380 --> 00:31.413
<i>You're committing treason, Sarah.</i>

00:31.481 --> 00:33.048
You could go to jail.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.517
I know.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.196 --> 00:50.432
According to the coordinates,
this should be Black Rock.

00:52.502 --> 00:54.202
Well, it doesn't exactly look

00:54.270 --> 00:56.138
like a FULCRUM compound
now, does it?

00:56.205 --> 00:57.773
Maybe your
flash was wrong.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.908
No, no, no. No, they had to
have just moved my father.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.076
Look at these. These
beer cans are fresh.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.611
There's still ash
on the cigarette butts.

01:02.678 --> 01:04.212
Could have been
kids having a party.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.882
Great. Now, we've
got to go back

01:06.949 --> 01:08.350
and start all over again.
- Chuck, we're AWOL.

01:08.418 --> 01:09.684
It's why we
ditched the car.

01:09.752 --> 01:10.819
If Casey finds us,

01:10.887 --> 01:12.554
I go to jail,

01:12.622 --> 01:16.024
you go to a padded cell
with 24-hour surveillance.

01:16.092 --> 01:17.959
There is no going back.

01:26.068 --> 01:28.069
Don't give up, Charles.

01:30.273 --> 01:32.641
Cute couple.

01:32.708 --> 01:35.343
If anything happens to them...
- What are you

01:35.411 --> 01:37.045
going to do?

01:37.113 --> 01:39.448
You going to...
you going to kill me?

01:39.515 --> 01:41.616
You going to beat me to a pulp?
- I'm sure you can

01:41.684 --> 01:43.351
come up with something
more creative than that.

01:43.419 --> 01:45.387
No, you...

01:45.455 --> 01:47.088
you had it right.
I'll kill you!

01:47.156 --> 01:49.157
Uh-uh, oh. Forgot about that.

01:49.225 --> 01:50.759
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.

01:50.827 --> 01:52.127
As long as the new Intersect

01:52.195 --> 01:54.262
is operational
by tomorrow night,

01:54.330 --> 01:56.531
your son will be fine.
- Hold on.

01:56.599 --> 01:57.899
There's still
a ton of diagnostics

01:57.967 --> 01:59.367
to run, simulations...

01:59.435 --> 02:01.703
I can't guarantee
I can finish it by then.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.272
Well then, I can't guarantee
your son's safety.

02:05.975 --> 02:07.542
<i>The safety of the Intersect</i>

02:07.610 --> 02:09.945
is no longer my main concern.

02:10.012 --> 02:12.314
I want you to hunt Agent Walker
and the Asset down.

02:12.381 --> 02:14.382
Bring them back--
dead or alive.

02:14.450 --> 02:15.650
Understood, General.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.018
Once the Intersect
is in our possession,

02:17.086 --> 02:18.520
this mission will be over
and you will have

02:18.588 --> 02:20.021
your pick of assignments.

02:20.089 --> 02:21.857
Your country thanks you...

02:21.924 --> 02:24.125
Colonel Casey.

02:24.193 --> 02:25.961
Congratulations.

02:26.028 --> 02:27.262
You've earned it.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.563
Got it.

02:37.206 --> 02:39.174
Hey, John.

02:40.576 --> 02:41.943
What are you
doing here, bro?

02:42.011 --> 02:44.145
Uh... I, I...

02:44.213 --> 02:45.747
Chuck hasn't been
showing up to work.

02:45.815 --> 02:46.948
I was looking for some clues

02:47.016 --> 02:48.617
where he might be.
- Hi, John.

02:48.684 --> 02:50.552
Hi.
- Chuck, I just, I just heard from him.

02:50.620 --> 02:51.987
Really? He just called?
- Yeah.

02:52.054 --> 02:53.488
He left a voice mail
not five minutes ago.

02:53.556 --> 02:54.956
Our wedding
is this weekend

02:55.024 --> 02:56.224
and he decided
to go out of town.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.293
Oh. Uh... well, good.

02:58.361 --> 02:59.628
Glad to hear...
hear he's safe.

02:59.695 --> 03:01.663
Sorry, nervous Nellie, I guess.

03:01.731 --> 03:03.331
Have a nice day!

03:03.399 --> 03:07.469
Babe, we've got to get
a lock for that window.

03:14.477 --> 03:16.945
I need emergency satellite
tracking on an unregistered line

03:17.013 --> 03:18.980
that dialed the following number
less than five minutes ago.

03:27.490 --> 03:31.192
So, um, as you can see...

03:31.260 --> 03:33.228
just the one bed.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.196
A little
presumptuous, I guess.

03:35.264 --> 03:36.965
Should I have asked
for separate rooms?

03:37.033 --> 03:38.600
No. It's fine.

03:38.668 --> 03:40.802
As long as we're on the lam,
I can't let you out of my sight.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.606
I'm going
to take a shower.

03:44.674 --> 03:46.908
I'm going to assume that
that whole out of sight thing

03:46.976 --> 03:48.410
doesn't really apply right now.

03:52.248 --> 03:54.115
Right.

03:57.887 --> 04:00.488
I'm at the motel a mile
south of the base.

04:00.556 --> 04:01.990
They just checked in.

04:02.058 --> 04:03.325
You want me to kill them?

04:03.392 --> 04:05.794
No. No.

04:05.861 --> 04:08.263
Vincent, I may need them
for leverage.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.066
When the tests are complete,
feel free to use

04:11.133 --> 04:12.601
whatever despicable acts

04:12.668 --> 04:15.470
of violence
are in your nature.

04:15.538 --> 04:17.372
You could eat them if you want,
I don't care.

04:26.582 --> 04:29.651
Uh... I'll, uh,
I'll sleep on the floor.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.720
No, it's okay.

04:41.964 --> 04:44.265
Why are you doing this?

04:44.333 --> 04:45.667
Because the floor is gross,

04:45.735 --> 04:47.736
and I'm not going
to make you sleep on it.

04:49.505 --> 04:50.972
No, I mean,
why are you here,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.709
risking everything that
you worked so hard for?

04:54.777 --> 04:58.980
Because, after everything that
you've done for this country,

04:59.048 --> 05:01.816
you deserve to find
your father,

05:01.884 --> 05:03.752
to get the Intersect
out of your head

05:03.819 --> 05:06.254
and to have a chance
at a normal life.

05:06.322 --> 05:08.289
Thank you.

05:08.357 --> 05:09.591
You don't have to thank me.

05:09.659 --> 05:11.159
It's my job to protect you.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.763
What about when
it's not your job?

05:14.830 --> 05:16.898
What happens to us then?

05:18.501 --> 05:20.669
One mission at a time, Chuck.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.118
Telecom tracking complete.
Location verified.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.319
Gotcha.

06:00.876 --> 06:02.343
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:02.411 --> 06:05.280
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:05.347 --> 06:06.881
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:06.949 --> 06:08.550
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:08.617 --> 06:10.085
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:10.152 --> 06:13.388
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:22.098 --> 06:24.399
Friends?
I wish people in our

06:24.467 --> 06:26.001
line of work could
afford friends.

06:26.068 --> 06:27.202
That's just one
of the sacrifices

06:27.270 --> 06:28.637
of upper management.

06:30.706 --> 06:32.174
Yeah, well, Big Mike
is my friend,

06:32.241 --> 06:34.042
and I never would have
betrayed him

06:34.110 --> 06:35.944
if you hadn't tricked me.

06:36.012 --> 06:38.280
Really?

06:38.347 --> 06:41.283
Do all your friends give your
mother urinary tract infections?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.053
Listen, Grimes.

06:45.121 --> 06:48.590
I am offering you a <i>cup</i> up

06:48.658 --> 06:50.258
the corporate ladder.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.993
Dude...
- Now...

06:52.061 --> 06:54.429
I need a new
assistant manager.

06:56.599 --> 06:58.600
Will you be my Ass Man?

07:00.336 --> 07:03.171
Are you kidding me?
No. Never.

07:03.239 --> 07:05.707
And as far as friends go,
I have Chuck; that's all I need.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.094
Don't move.
Don't move.

08:33.162 --> 08:34.562
Okay.
- Don't breathe.

08:34.630 --> 08:35.764
Don't move, don't
breathe, don't move.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.967
Just stay there. Stay there.
Stay. Stay.

08:56.852 --> 08:56.918
I'm going to kill you, Morgan.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.755
<i>Dead man walking.</i>

09:04.093 --> 09:05.460
What do you want,
Morgan?

09:05.528 --> 09:07.295
I want to speak to Michael.

09:07.363 --> 09:08.596
I want to clear the air.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.442
Come closer.

09:23.913 --> 09:25.947
Mike, I know
that this...

09:26.015 --> 09:27.716
this whole thing is my fault.

09:27.783 --> 09:29.784
I never knew Emmett

09:29.852 --> 09:31.519
was trying to take
over the store.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.854
Truth is,

09:32.922 --> 09:35.223
I just wanted you
to stop dating my mother.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.025
You should be so lucky that a man

09:37.093 --> 09:38.526
of his stature
would defile your mother.

09:39.562 --> 09:40.962
Um, sorry.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.731
Never take sides

09:42.798 --> 09:44.833
against the family again.
- Understood.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.101
What can I do
to make it right?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.736
I'll do anything...

09:47.803 --> 09:49.371
stepfather.

09:49.438 --> 09:51.039
Michael, there's a mess that

09:51.107 --> 09:53.174
needs cleaning
in bathroom stall three.

09:53.242 --> 09:54.576
No, let me do it.

09:54.643 --> 09:55.710
Sir, I'll handle this.

09:55.778 --> 09:57.946
We all have

09:58.014 --> 10:00.949
to clean up our own messes
in this world, son.

10:06.055 --> 10:08.456
This can stop
anytime you want.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.393
All you have to do
is accept my offer.

10:15.097 --> 10:16.364
Yeah, okay, Emmett.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.270
Okay, don't move.
I'm going to be right back.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.374
Oh, oh, oh...

10:29.979 --> 10:31.913
I have very sensitive sinuses.

10:31.981 --> 10:33.815
Well, nine millimeters
of hot lead

10:33.883 --> 10:35.183
should clear
that right out.

10:35.251 --> 10:37.652
You really think you could run
away from me? Let's go.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.155
What? Okay. Look, Sarah had
nothing to do with this.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.322
What's going
to happen to her?

10:41.390 --> 10:45.427
Sir, we have an issue.

10:50.332 --> 10:51.766
I told her
not to move.

11:09.885 --> 11:11.586
Ooh...

11:16.625 --> 11:17.625
Chuck, let's go.

11:17.693 --> 11:18.526
Sorry, Casey.

11:20.696 --> 11:22.263
Oh, God.

11:35.177 --> 11:36.845
Oh! Oh!

11:36.912 --> 11:38.546
FULCRUM is here.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.515
We can't leave Casey.
They're going to find him and torture him.

11:40.583 --> 11:41.716
Chuck, don't you get it?

11:41.784 --> 11:42.951
If we go back,
he's going to arrest us.

11:43.018 --> 11:45.086
Yes, I know.
But we can't leave him.

11:46.922 --> 11:50.291
Okay, fine. One condition:
you stay in the car.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.160
Deal.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.284
Going somewhere, Bartowski?

12:16.352 --> 12:19.354
No, no! We came back here
for you because FULCRUM's here.

12:19.421 --> 12:21.890
Well, then we better get out of here.
- I'm not leaving without Sarah.

12:21.957 --> 12:23.324
You drive or I end you.

12:23.392 --> 12:25.059
End me? Oh, yeah?
How're you going to do that?

12:25.127 --> 12:26.261
You don't have a gun.
- You don't think

12:26.328 --> 12:27.729
I could kill you
with my thumb or my elbow?

12:27.796 --> 12:30.165
Nerd bludgeoned by radiator?

12:30.232 --> 12:31.566
You can't kill me
with that radiator.

12:31.634 --> 12:32.967
It is far too confined
in this car

12:33.035 --> 12:34.602
for you to get
the appropriate torque.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.337
I could strangle you
with the handcuff chain.

12:36.405 --> 12:37.772
Yeah, yeah, you could
maybe do that.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.241
Too late.

12:40.309 --> 12:41.776
They got her. Let's go.

12:42.878 --> 12:44.712
I told you.

12:44.780 --> 12:45.813
I'm not leaving without Sarah.

12:45.881 --> 12:47.482
Bartowski, no!

12:49.952 --> 12:51.019
Idiot!

12:58.994 --> 13:00.261
Stay down!

13:26.989 --> 13:29.023
Drop it!

13:29.091 --> 13:30.358
Can't do that, John.

13:30.426 --> 13:32.126
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

13:32.194 --> 13:33.428
Let's just-- let's just
take a beat here.

13:33.495 --> 13:34.729
Remember, we are a team.

13:34.797 --> 13:36.097
Stay in the car!
- Stay in the car!

13:36.165 --> 13:38.233
Technically, I still have
one foot in the car.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.870
How far you think
you're going to get?

13:42.938 --> 13:44.739
Until we rescue Chuck's dad.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.277
Uh-oh, Walker, you're out

13:49.345 --> 13:50.245
of bullets.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.081
It's over.

13:54.516 --> 13:56.017
On the ground.

14:07.997 --> 14:10.064
You two mind
taking that outside?

14:10.132 --> 14:11.466
We're in a bomb shelter.

14:22.978 --> 14:24.979
I'm sorry, Sarah.

14:25.047 --> 14:26.714
You didn't do anything
wrong, Chuck.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.584
You trusted somebody who
you thought cared about you.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.625
Look outside, Chuck.

14:38.927 --> 14:40.128
Look out the window.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.036
<i>"Tron." Tron!</i>

14:48.103 --> 14:49.771
<i>Tron!</i> Did you see that?
My father signaled me!

14:49.838 --> 14:51.205
What? Did you just flash?

14:51.273 --> 14:52.573
No, but come on.
A midnight screening of <i>Tron?</i>

14:52.641 --> 14:53.941
My father had to have written
that, Casey.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.576
Casey, come on, please.
We got to go back there!

14:55.644 --> 14:56.878
My father's there!

14:56.945 --> 14:59.080
Casey, please!

15:02.084 --> 15:03.484
I don't care.

15:12.441 --> 15:13.708
Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

15:13.776 --> 15:14.876
Something weird
is going on.

15:14.944 --> 15:16.111
Have you seen Chuck?

15:16.178 --> 15:17.645
He didn't come
home last night,

15:17.713 --> 15:19.147
and Casey came by,
said he was worried about him.

15:19.215 --> 15:21.449
Casey... yeah. Yeah.

15:21.517 --> 15:23.384
I'm sure. Can't live without
his precious Chuck.

15:23.452 --> 15:25.453
What's that supposed to mean?

15:25.521 --> 15:28.189
The guy's obsessed with him,
a classic perv.

15:28.257 --> 15:29.357
No offense.

15:29.425 --> 15:30.558
Obsessed how?

15:30.626 --> 15:34.095
You want to see
something really freaky?

15:34.163 --> 15:35.997
Check it out.

15:40.836 --> 15:41.970
Dude keeps a Chuck diary.

15:43.739 --> 15:45.373
Bathroom visits...

15:45.441 --> 15:46.608
and duration.

15:46.675 --> 15:47.775
Keys,

15:47.843 --> 15:50.345
duct tape,

15:50.412 --> 15:52.413
high-grade chloroform...
- Whoa.

15:52.481 --> 15:55.183
From one stalker to another,
I'm impressed.

15:55.251 --> 15:57.185
You guys think this has

15:57.253 --> 15:58.686
something to do
with Chuck missing?

15:58.754 --> 15:59.888
I don't care.

15:59.955 --> 16:01.422
No clue.

16:01.490 --> 16:04.459
You mind if I, uh...
get right?

16:12.535 --> 16:14.702
Casey, please!

16:14.770 --> 16:16.871
Excellent work.

16:16.939 --> 16:17.906
Thank you, General.

16:17.973 --> 16:19.440
A CIA team is on their way

16:19.508 --> 16:21.209
to take Agent Walker
and the Asset back to Langley.

16:21.277 --> 16:22.744
General, what about my father?

16:22.811 --> 16:24.312
Chuck received a signal
from his father.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.214
He believes there may be a mission
tonight at the drive-in.

16:26.282 --> 16:28.716
We'll look into it, Ms. Walker.

16:28.784 --> 16:31.452
In the meantime,
enjoy your last few moments

16:31.520 --> 16:34.022
in Burbank, Colonel Casey.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.728
Colonel Casey, huh?

16:40.796 --> 16:43.064
Now I get it.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.500
Now I understand why you
would betray your own team.

16:45.568 --> 16:47.669
I would never betray my team!

16:47.736 --> 16:49.404
You went AWOL.

16:49.471 --> 16:51.306
You betrayed me.

16:52.641 --> 16:54.475
Don't you ever forget that.

16:55.878 --> 16:57.078
So sorry, Colonel.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.546
But congratulations on that

16:58.614 --> 17:00.982
chicken franchise
you always wanted.

17:01.050 --> 17:02.850
Yeah, keep talking, Bartowski...
- Casey, stay on Beckman, please.

17:02.918 --> 17:04.586
It might be too late
by midnight tonight.

17:04.653 --> 17:06.421
Just make sure we don't give up
on Chuck's father.

17:06.488 --> 17:07.888
If your dad's there...

17:09.525 --> 17:10.758
...we'll keep him safe.

17:10.826 --> 17:11.792
You have my word.

17:28.277 --> 17:29.811
John?

17:31.981 --> 17:33.748
Bingo.

17:35.317 --> 17:37.085
Hello?

17:37.152 --> 17:38.987
It's your neighbor,
Devon Woodcomb.

17:39.054 --> 17:40.154
Door was unlocked.

17:42.057 --> 17:43.491
This is creepy.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.264
Is that Chuck's bedroom?

17:49.331 --> 17:51.099
Freakburger...

17:54.470 --> 17:56.070
Whoa.

18:02.544 --> 18:04.379
I hate this whole family.

18:05.948 --> 18:08.816
Boss Man calling Ass Man.

18:08.884 --> 18:09.984
Yes, Emmett?

18:10.052 --> 18:11.219
Ah, radio check.

18:11.287 --> 18:13.021
The new automated
checkout registers have

18:13.088 --> 18:15.256
arrived; if you could please
have Mike go and unload them.

18:15.324 --> 18:16.691
Hold on a second.
No, you said that

18:16.759 --> 18:18.026
if I agreed...
In-Into the headset.

18:18.093 --> 18:19.394
Into the headset.

18:19.461 --> 18:21.562
You said that if I agreed

18:21.630 --> 18:23.298
to be your ass man,

18:23.365 --> 18:25.533
you wouldn't make Mike do
any more humiliating jobs.

18:25.601 --> 18:26.734
And you wouldn't fire him.

18:26.802 --> 18:28.236
Get it done.

18:34.777 --> 18:36.611
Ha-ha! Good luck using

18:36.679 --> 18:38.613
automated checkout machines
with no power.

18:38.681 --> 18:40.481
Where'd you get that?
- Casey's locker.

18:40.549 --> 18:42.617
Morgan's really turned
into Emmett's stooge.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.921
This will show them
who's really in charge.

18:48.424 --> 18:50.458
Cool. We did it.

18:52.328 --> 18:53.394
That way! That way!
Go!

18:58.334 --> 19:01.369
For whatever it's worth...

19:01.437 --> 19:03.705
if I have to spend
the rest of my days

19:03.772 --> 19:07.775
in a dark, windowless room,

19:07.843 --> 19:10.945
I can't think of a better
person to spend it with.

19:11.013 --> 19:12.914
That's not really
how this works.

19:12.981 --> 19:14.515
What?

19:14.583 --> 19:18.252
We can't request a cozy
little two-bed, two-bath cell?

19:18.320 --> 19:19.954
Two-bed?

19:34.570 --> 19:35.803
Electrical interruption.

19:35.871 --> 19:37.438
Auxiliary power activated.

19:37.506 --> 19:39.307
My God. Quick, before
the power turns back on.

19:41.577 --> 19:43.644
Is that Awesome?

19:43.712 --> 19:45.146
Oh, no...

19:45.214 --> 19:47.048
Oh, no.

19:47.116 --> 19:48.649
Ass Man!

19:48.717 --> 19:51.152
We are under siege!

19:51.220 --> 19:52.854
Shoot to kill!

19:54.390 --> 19:56.557
Well... hey, there, Emmett.

19:58.193 --> 19:59.994
Well...

20:00.062 --> 20:01.662
It is a good
thing I installed

20:01.730 --> 20:03.431
those emergency generators.
- I underestimate you.

20:04.733 --> 20:06.401
That was awesome!

20:06.468 --> 20:08.836
Fire them.
- Move! Move!

20:08.904 --> 20:12.073
I saw you on the security cam!

20:12.141 --> 20:13.307
Okay, stay calm.

20:14.510 --> 20:15.376
Hey, Devon.

20:17.579 --> 20:19.514
Hey, John.

20:19.581 --> 20:20.815
How're you doing?

20:26.422 --> 20:27.789
What are you doing here?

20:27.856 --> 20:32.126
Look, John, um...
we need to talk.

20:32.194 --> 20:33.928
Hmm.
- I get it, dude.

20:33.996 --> 20:35.863
You know, there was
a time in my life

20:35.931 --> 20:37.732
that I didn't have
a lot going on either.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.600
Dead-end job, no girl...

20:39.668 --> 20:41.335
Really?

20:41.403 --> 20:42.837
Well, no, John.

20:42.905 --> 20:45.940
No, but this is
not the answer. Okay?

20:46.008 --> 20:48.476
You need help, bro.
You need serious

20:48.544 --> 20:49.811
psychiatric help.
- Hmm.

20:49.878 --> 20:52.780
John? Whoa, John!
What are you doing, man?!

20:52.848 --> 20:55.450
Put the gun
away, dude!

20:55.517 --> 20:57.185
Bro, take another step
and I will drop you.

21:14.336 --> 21:15.970
Not bad for a frat boy.

21:18.474 --> 21:19.640
Don't you move.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.275
What the...?! Sarah?

21:22.244 --> 21:22.810
Chuck?!

21:23.979 --> 21:25.746
What the hell is
going on here?

21:25.814 --> 21:27.748
Devon.

21:27.816 --> 21:29.484
Don't freak out.

21:33.445 --> 21:34.612
Chuck... Chuck, this is crazy.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.080
We've got to call
the police.

21:36.148 --> 21:37.782
Devon, we can't do this.

21:37.850 --> 21:38.916
Here, uh, drink this.

21:38.984 --> 21:40.118
He tried to kill me!

21:40.185 --> 21:42.086
Why can't we
call the cops?

21:42.154 --> 21:43.254
Because I am the cops.
- Chuck!

21:45.924 --> 21:46.691
Moron.

21:49.428 --> 21:52.063
Devon, I am a high-level CIA
asset and these are my handlers.

21:52.131 --> 21:53.831
For the past two years,
they've had to watch

21:53.899 --> 21:55.433
and protect my every move.
- Chuck!

21:55.501 --> 21:57.135
No!
- He can handle it.

21:57.202 --> 21:59.103
You can handle this, right?
Tell me you can handle this.

21:59.171 --> 22:00.771
You're being serious?

22:02.341 --> 22:03.441
He's being serious?

22:03.509 --> 22:05.009
Devon, I need you to help me.

22:05.077 --> 22:07.678
I need you to be cool about this.

22:07.746 --> 22:10.248
I need you to cover
for me with Ellie.

22:10.315 --> 22:11.716
I need you...

22:11.783 --> 22:13.818
to be Awesome.

22:13.886 --> 22:16.387
Can you be Awesome?

22:19.791 --> 22:21.592
You're a spy, Chuck?

22:24.296 --> 22:26.063
Yeah, more or less, yeah.

22:27.699 --> 22:29.233
Whoa.

22:29.301 --> 22:32.436
Wow...

22:32.504 --> 22:34.338
This is...

22:35.908 --> 22:37.508
Awesome!

22:37.576 --> 22:39.877
I knew you weren't

22:39.945 --> 22:41.379
a loser who worked
at the Buy More.

22:41.446 --> 22:43.514
"Loser's" a little--
that's a little harsh.

22:43.582 --> 22:45.449
Okay, here. Here's the thing--
the Buy More actually,

22:45.517 --> 22:46.651
uh, is real.

22:46.718 --> 22:47.818
But here's the most
important thing.

22:47.886 --> 22:49.554
And I need you to do
this for me right now.

22:49.621 --> 22:52.356
I need you to go home
and handle Ellie.

22:52.424 --> 22:54.325
That is your mission.

22:54.393 --> 22:55.493
Can you do that?

22:55.561 --> 22:57.562
I got your back, bro.

22:58.830 --> 23:00.331
Right, right.

23:02.401 --> 23:03.701
A spy!

23:03.769 --> 23:05.102
Keep that on the D.L.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.637
Impersonating
a military official's

23:06.705 --> 23:07.738
a federal offense, numbnuts.

23:07.806 --> 23:09.073
Put it on the list.

23:09.141 --> 23:10.074
Don't you leave me here,
Bartowski.

23:10.142 --> 23:12.043
Well, we got to go.

23:12.110 --> 23:13.945
You walk out that door,
you're a dead man.

23:14.012 --> 23:16.080
I don't care.

23:16.148 --> 23:17.848
Oh, you will care.

23:19.484 --> 23:21.886
I smell bacon.

23:21.954 --> 23:24.121
Anyone else smell pig?

23:24.189 --> 23:26.457
I seem to detect the faint odor
of the forbidden meat.

23:26.525 --> 23:27.658
Okay, knock it off.
Listen to me.

23:27.726 --> 23:28.960
Guys, you need to apologize

23:29.027 --> 23:30.595
to Emmett for blowing
the power, otherwise

23:30.662 --> 23:31.729
he's going to can you.

23:31.797 --> 23:32.897
Nice try.

23:32.965 --> 23:35.266
Get us to apologize
so we look like asses.

23:35.334 --> 23:36.734
Lose all our street cred.

23:36.802 --> 23:38.202
Morgan, you're going
to have to accept one concept.

23:38.270 --> 23:39.670
What's that?

23:39.738 --> 23:42.840
No one on this planet
is as dumb as you are.

23:44.509 --> 23:46.611
I'm trying to help you guys.
- Are you?

23:46.678 --> 23:49.080
Why are you taking
all this crap from everyone?

23:49.147 --> 23:50.781
What choice do I have,
all right?

23:50.849 --> 23:52.416
Emmett is trying to fire
the entire store,

23:52.484 --> 23:53.951
and I am the glue
that holds it all together.

23:54.019 --> 23:56.454
Why do you care
if this store holds together?

23:56.521 --> 23:57.955
What do you mean?

23:58.023 --> 23:59.790
I mean, don't you have
some goal

23:59.858 --> 24:01.225
in this world
outside the store?

24:01.293 --> 24:03.694
Even Jeff and Lester
have their ridiculous band.

24:03.762 --> 24:05.463
Don't you have a dream, Morgan?

24:05.530 --> 24:06.964
Yeah, of course, I do.

24:07.032 --> 24:08.366
It's just...

24:08.433 --> 24:09.367
What?

24:09.434 --> 24:10.968
It's crazy

24:11.036 --> 24:12.270
and you'll laugh at me.

24:12.337 --> 24:14.839
No, no, no--
I promise, I won't laugh.

24:14.906 --> 24:16.707
Promise?

24:20.946 --> 24:22.980
I'd like to be
a Benihana chef...

24:23.048 --> 24:24.749
in Hawaii.

24:29.554 --> 24:30.921
I know. It's stupid.

24:30.989 --> 24:32.390
No. No, no, no, Morgan!

24:32.457 --> 24:34.392
No, no, it's not stupid.

24:34.459 --> 24:36.160
It's totally attainable.

24:36.228 --> 24:37.428
No, it's not, Anna.

24:37.496 --> 24:39.530
You have to train for,
like, years, okay?

24:39.598 --> 24:41.866
I'm way past my prime,
I am not Asian

24:41.933 --> 24:44.302
and I don't even know
where to get the knives.

24:44.369 --> 24:46.270
Ass Man, I need you.

24:46.338 --> 24:49.473
Yeah. Ass Man on his way.

25:03.522 --> 25:05.423
Agent Casey?

25:05.490 --> 25:06.390
General.

25:06.458 --> 25:08.392
We ran a thermal satellite scan

25:08.460 --> 25:10.194
of the coordinates,
and activity was present.

25:10.262 --> 25:12.763
It seems FULCRUM has moved
their operation underground.

25:12.831 --> 25:14.332
Bartowski was right.

25:14.399 --> 25:16.133
We sending in a team
to rescue his father?

25:16.201 --> 25:17.568
We don't have time for that.

25:17.636 --> 25:19.804
I've ordered a squadron of F-16s
to annihilate the site.

25:19.871 --> 25:21.939
But I gave my word.

25:22.007 --> 25:24.075
I have not come
to this decision lightly.

25:24.142 --> 25:25.910
We have no other choice.

25:32.918 --> 25:34.318
Chuck's a spy.

25:34.386 --> 25:36.787
Stay cool.

25:36.855 --> 25:38.222
Stay cool.

25:38.290 --> 25:39.790
There you are.

25:39.858 --> 25:42.119
Did you learn anything
about Chuck at the Buy More?

25:42.120 --> 25:42.293
Huh?

25:42.361 --> 25:44.562
Chuck, he's supposed to pick up
your parents at the airport.

25:44.629 --> 25:46.330
Honey?

25:46.398 --> 25:47.898
Why are you just
looking at me like that?

25:47.966 --> 25:49.367
It's a really simple question.

25:49.434 --> 25:51.068
Have you talked to Chuck?
- Yeah.

25:51.136 --> 25:52.470
I mean, no.

25:52.537 --> 25:55.573
I mean, um...
well, he's fine, yeah.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.774
So you spoke to him?

25:56.842 --> 25:59.610
No! Definitely not.

26:01.213 --> 26:02.947
Someone else spoke to him?
Casey?

26:04.015 --> 26:05.282
No. Sarah?

26:05.350 --> 26:06.117
Who?

26:06.184 --> 26:07.918
Oh, no.

26:07.986 --> 26:09.186
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, no.

26:09.254 --> 26:10.454
I need you
to focus, okay?

26:10.522 --> 26:11.856
No wedding day jitters!

26:11.923 --> 26:13.557
We've got company coming
any moment,

26:13.625 --> 26:15.226
my father and my brother
are MIA,

26:15.293 --> 26:17.328
so I just need you to pull it together.
Can you do that?

26:17.396 --> 26:19.330
Can you be Awesome for me?

26:19.398 --> 26:20.998
Yeah.

26:21.066 --> 26:21.799
Yeah? Good.

26:21.867 --> 26:23.134
No, no, no!

26:23.201 --> 26:24.101
You focus! Focus!

26:24.169 --> 26:26.504
I need your A game.

26:38.650 --> 26:39.850
What, no gun for me?

26:39.918 --> 26:41.752
No. You get
to stay in the car.

26:41.820 --> 26:43.320
Come on, the whole stay
in the car bit?

26:43.388 --> 26:45.156
Aren't we past this?
I think I'm perfectly capable

26:45.223 --> 26:47.191
of handling myself on a mission.

26:47.259 --> 26:48.859
You were saying,
Agent Imbecile?

26:48.927 --> 26:50.561
Drop it, Walker.
- You drop it.

26:50.629 --> 26:51.762
Sarah, don't! Don't.
- I've come this far.

26:51.830 --> 26:52.897
If he's going to stop me,

26:52.964 --> 26:54.698
he's going to have
to kill me.

26:54.766 --> 26:57.234
Beckman called in an air strike.
It'll be here in less than 20 minutes.

26:57.302 --> 26:58.436
What? Casey, my
father is here!

26:58.503 --> 26:59.904
You said you
would rescue him.

26:59.971 --> 27:02.206
You gave me your word.

27:04.576 --> 27:06.477
I thought that would
have meant something.

27:06.545 --> 27:07.878
I guess I have
a lot to learn.

27:07.946 --> 27:09.613
Yeah, that's right. You do.

27:09.681 --> 27:11.115
You made three crucial
mistakes, Bartowski.

27:11.183 --> 27:12.650
You didn't realize
you were being trailed

27:12.717 --> 27:14.785
for the last half hour,
you didn't bring nearly

27:14.853 --> 27:16.687
enough firepower,

27:16.755 --> 27:18.556
and you didn't
ask me to join.

27:22.227 --> 27:24.662
Wha...

27:24.729 --> 27:26.130
Casey?

27:26.198 --> 27:29.366
Would you like to help us
rescue my father?

27:29.434 --> 27:32.136
I think your father has served
our country honorably

27:32.204 --> 27:33.704
and deserves to attend
his daughter's wedding.

27:33.772 --> 27:35.039
Is that a yes?
- One condition.

27:35.106 --> 27:37.141
He stays in the car.
- Agreed.

27:37.209 --> 27:38.442
Done. Hey!

27:38.510 --> 27:40.444
Hey, the team's
back together again!

27:40.512 --> 27:42.079
Group hug!
- One more step,

27:42.147 --> 27:44.482
it'll be your last; no hugs!
- In the car I go.

27:51.289 --> 27:54.158
Aces, Charles. Aces.

27:54.226 --> 27:55.726
How's my favorite

27:55.794 --> 27:57.495
underachieving,
reclusive,

27:57.562 --> 27:59.663
kidnapped scientist?

27:59.731 --> 28:00.931
It's done.

28:00.999 --> 28:04.134
There's your Intersect.

28:04.202 --> 28:05.236
Oh, you're a dream.

28:05.303 --> 28:06.737
There is...

28:06.805 --> 28:08.772
one request.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.040
Anything that won't
inconvenience me

28:10.108 --> 28:11.375
is fine, I don't care.

28:11.443 --> 28:13.944
Leave my family alone.

28:14.012 --> 28:15.746
You say I'm not invited
to the wedding?

28:15.814 --> 28:17.114
How did you know...?
- I'm involved

28:17.182 --> 28:19.049
in a major conglomerate
of bad guys.

28:19.117 --> 28:21.151
Few details escape me.

28:21.219 --> 28:23.721
Stevie, this works,

28:23.788 --> 28:25.089
you have nothing to worry about.

28:25.156 --> 28:26.323
It's a little tart in here.

28:27.893 --> 28:29.493
I'll send down some
air freshener.

28:39.604 --> 28:41.705
Definitely staying in the car.

28:41.773 --> 28:44.208
I had no idea <i>Tron</i>
was so popular.

28:46.144 --> 28:47.411
Hey, hey.

28:49.047 --> 28:50.481
Yeah, yeah.
Go! Go!

28:55.587 --> 28:57.354
Bingo.

29:14.205 --> 29:17.641
Welcome! I see you all
found your way.

29:17.709 --> 29:20.077
Directions were good.

29:20.145 --> 29:21.879
You have all been
carefully selected

29:21.947 --> 29:23.547
by FULCRUM to be the next

29:23.615 --> 29:25.816
generation
of Intersect agents.

29:25.884 --> 29:28.919
More capable than any computer.

29:28.987 --> 29:32.923
More efficient
than any spy in history.

29:32.991 --> 29:35.626
Welcome to the future!

29:35.694 --> 29:37.027
Can you dig it?

29:39.030 --> 29:42.433
Whoa! That's not the response
I was hoping for.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.201
Can you dig it?!

29:44.269 --> 29:46.904
Yes!

29:48.139 --> 29:49.473
Oh, my God.

29:49.541 --> 29:52.076
He's using the Intersect
to build an army.

29:52.143 --> 29:55.879
Can you dig it?!

29:59.966 --> 30:02.634
The program will be
begin in three minutes.

30:02.702 --> 30:04.569
Three minutes.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.282
You fellas have
a cigar for me?

30:17.350 --> 30:19.451
I thought you hated smoke.
- I figure if I'm going

30:19.518 --> 30:21.720
to die, I might as well see
what all the fuss is about.

30:21.787 --> 30:22.821
Huh?

30:22.888 --> 30:24.089
All right.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.062
Keys.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.637
Hurry up. There's an air strike
headed this way.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.574
Three minutes to target,
General Beckman.

30:42.642 --> 30:44.142
Prepping weapon systems.

30:53.286 --> 30:56.655
"Gone to stop Roark.
Be back in five.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.056
Chuck."

30:58.124 --> 30:59.724
I'm going to kill him.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.393
Don't worry, Agent Casey,

31:01.460 --> 31:02.794
we'll take care of that.

31:13.406 --> 31:16.441
The prodigal son returns.

31:16.509 --> 31:17.776
Thank you for saving me

31:17.843 --> 31:19.144
the trouble
of hunting you down.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.281
My pleasure.
- Move it.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.483
Oh!

31:25.551 --> 31:28.019
Great, the gang's
all here.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.188
It's only fair
that a son should

31:30.256 --> 31:32.157
see the results
of his father's labor.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.426
Of course if
this doesn't work,

31:34.493 --> 31:36.561
I'm afraid I have to go back

31:36.629 --> 31:38.096
to that bit
where I kill everybody.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.230
What if it does work?

31:39.298 --> 31:40.732
If it does work?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.634
Same result,
but, you know,

31:42.702 --> 31:44.069
you should root for it.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.504
I mean, nobody likes a cynic.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.375
Let's get right
to the countdown, shall we?

31:50.443 --> 31:55.947
Five, four, three--
I'm excited. Huh?

31:56.015 --> 31:57.816
Two... one.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.351
Casey! Sarah! Shut your eyes!

32:02.521 --> 32:04.022
Keep them closed.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.363
Chuck, look--
look at the screen.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.164
No, Dad, I don't
want a refresh, okay?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.467
I just want this
nightmare to be over.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.702
I know, that's why I made
this for you.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.104
It's all for you.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.139
Trust me, son.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.701
Wow.

32:49.769 --> 32:50.668
Oh, what a rush.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.170
What a rush.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.205
I-I got to flash.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.907
I got to flash.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.245
I'm not flashing.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.847
I'm not flashing!
It's not working!

33:02.915 --> 33:04.048
There must be some
kind of a glitch.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.517
I'll have to take it
back to the lab.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.684
No more labs!

33:06.752 --> 33:08.286
A deal is a deal!

33:08.354 --> 33:10.188
Your son is dead! Get him up.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.192
What the hell is that?

33:27.740 --> 33:28.973
Get him up.
Get him up.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.075
I've got Chuck.
You guys get out of here.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.112
Chuck, are you okay?

34:12.184 --> 34:13.318
I feel...

34:13.385 --> 34:15.620
I feel different.

34:15.688 --> 34:16.487
Lighter.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.456
It worked.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.225
What worked?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.993
This.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.096
I programmed it to remove
the Intersect from Chuck's head.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.965
What do you mean remove?

34:27.032 --> 34:28.666
The Intersect is out.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.603
It's over, Chuck.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.974
You're free, son.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.273
Colonel Casey,
am I to understand

34:50.341 --> 34:51.975
that you rescued
Mr. Bartowski,

34:52.043 --> 34:54.177
recovered the Intersect cube

34:54.245 --> 34:56.612
and destroyed FULCRUM's
operation base?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.314
That's correct.

34:58.382 --> 35:00.183
Perhaps I should be promoting
you to general.

35:00.251 --> 35:02.152
Actually,

35:02.219 --> 35:05.155
Agent Walker's the one responsible
for the success of the mission.

35:05.222 --> 35:07.157
She pretended to go AWOL.

35:07.224 --> 35:08.792
Used herself
and the Asset as bait

35:08.859 --> 35:10.093
to lure FULCRUM out

35:10.161 --> 35:12.062
so we could
secure their location.

35:12.129 --> 35:14.497
She risked her life to preserve
the integrity of the mission.

35:14.565 --> 35:16.366
If anyone deserves a
commendation, it's Walker.

35:16.434 --> 35:18.368
Actually, General, I never...

35:18.436 --> 35:20.303
Never thought she
could be so cold.

35:20.371 --> 35:21.604
I mean, I didn't,
certainly.

35:21.672 --> 35:22.639
She used me as bait,

35:22.706 --> 35:23.973
like Casey just said.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.542
Treated terribly, you know.

35:25.609 --> 35:28.311
I mean, she cuffed me,
I had chaffing on my wrists.

35:28.379 --> 35:29.612
I was malnourished.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.449
It was... it was, uh...
horrific.

35:33.684 --> 35:34.884
Ow.

35:34.952 --> 35:36.619
Well, then, Colonel Casey,

35:36.687 --> 35:38.321
now that the Intersect
project is over,

35:38.389 --> 35:39.989
I assume you want to return

35:40.057 --> 35:41.357
to command your old unit?

35:41.425 --> 35:43.660
I'm sorry, General, I
just want to make sure

35:43.727 --> 35:44.461
I didn't misinterpret
anything.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.298
Did you just say "over"?

35:48.365 --> 35:49.999
That's correct.

35:50.067 --> 35:51.568
We have the Intersect cube,

35:51.635 --> 35:55.004
FULCRUM is defeated,
your mission complete.

35:55.072 --> 35:57.807
Mr. Bartowski,
you are free to return to...

35:57.875 --> 35:59.809
whatever it is you do.

35:59.877 --> 36:03.179
General, I-I-I'd, uh...
I'd just like to say

36:03.247 --> 36:06.449
that although I-I know we've had
our share of ups and downs,

36:06.517 --> 36:11.254
this has been an
incredible, dare I say,

36:11.322 --> 36:14.357
life-changing experience...

36:14.425 --> 36:17.026
...that apparently you don't
feel quite as strongly about.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.828
I get it-- you're
busy-- government.

36:18.896 --> 36:19.996
It's a little rude.

36:22.633 --> 36:24.601
Why are the Brothers Imbecile
still working here?

36:24.668 --> 36:27.003
Can we just give them
one more chance, please?

36:27.071 --> 36:31.207
You know what, Grimes,
I'm gonna ask you

36:31.275 --> 36:34.043
a very important question.

36:34.111 --> 36:38.982
And I want you to think
very long and hard about it.

36:39.049 --> 36:41.651
Do you want to be a loser
the rest of your life?

36:41.719 --> 36:43.553
That's an excellent
question, Emmett.

36:43.621 --> 36:45.588
Hmm.

36:45.656 --> 36:48.625
If you had asked
me that this morning,

36:48.692 --> 36:50.560
I probably would
have said yes.

36:50.628 --> 36:51.995
Hmm.

36:52.062 --> 36:54.097
Now I'm not so sure.

36:54.165 --> 36:56.499
Then do what needs to be done.

36:58.135 --> 36:59.569
Yes, sir.

37:05.476 --> 37:08.912
Big Mike, in the old country,
if a man did the honorable thing

37:08.979 --> 37:10.480
and he fell on his own sword,

37:10.548 --> 37:11.981
his family was looked after.

37:12.049 --> 37:14.317
That was a good break.

37:14.385 --> 37:16.653
Real nice deal.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.887
Yeah.

37:17.955 --> 37:20.023
Will you look after my mother?

37:20.090 --> 37:21.524
I will.

37:21.592 --> 37:24.127
Gentlemen, it's been

37:24.195 --> 37:26.596
a pleasure serving with you.

37:26.664 --> 37:28.331
If you retell the story,
do me a favor

37:28.399 --> 37:30.867
and, uh, give me
a better physique.

37:30.935 --> 37:32.368
What are
you doing?

37:36.540 --> 37:37.840
Morgan out.

37:47.484 --> 37:48.985
Anna Wu,

37:49.053 --> 37:51.754
will you come
to Hawaii with me,

37:51.822 --> 37:54.090
where I will learn
the ancient art of hibachi?

37:54.158 --> 37:57.393
Morgan, I thought
you'd never ask.

38:02.266 --> 38:03.933
This is so great.

38:07.271 --> 38:09.505
Oh, one second, hold on.

38:09.573 --> 38:10.740
Okay.

38:10.808 --> 38:12.008
Hey.

38:12.076 --> 38:14.744
Hey, hey.

38:14.812 --> 38:16.079
A little hot
in here, buddy?

38:16.146 --> 38:17.447
It's a bit chilly,
you know,

38:17.514 --> 38:18.715
but, uh, worth it.

38:18.782 --> 38:19.749
Is everything okay?

38:19.817 --> 38:21.884
Yeah. No, dude, actually,

38:21.952 --> 38:24.387
for the first time
everything is-is fine.

38:26.457 --> 38:27.957
It's all over.

38:32.162 --> 38:33.730
God, I admire him.

38:50.481 --> 38:52.382
You're free, Morgan!

38:54.351 --> 38:56.953
You're free!

39:04.328 --> 39:05.962
Babe, we are late.
We have to go.

39:07.364 --> 39:08.865
I can't.

39:08.932 --> 39:10.500
Honey, we have a whole
rehearsal dinner

39:10.567 --> 39:12.335
full of people
waiting for us.

39:12.403 --> 39:14.137
I knew that my dad
would disappoint me,

39:14.204 --> 39:15.805
but I just didn't think
that Chuck would.

39:15.873 --> 39:18.174
I don't know, it must
be in the DNA.

39:22.546 --> 39:26.316
Ellie...

39:26.383 --> 39:29.018
I know it's difficult
without Chuck,

39:29.086 --> 39:32.455
but he wants to be
here, I know he does.

39:32.523 --> 39:36.159
Your dad leaving shook him up
pretty bad.

39:38.162 --> 39:40.596
Ellie, he'll be back.

39:40.664 --> 39:44.500
Trust me-- he loves you.

39:44.568 --> 39:46.002
So do I.

39:51.742 --> 39:52.975
Chuck, where
have you been?!

39:53.043 --> 39:56.012
I was getting
your wedding present.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.214
Dad...

39:58.282 --> 40:00.149
Hi...

40:00.217 --> 40:03.419
Are you staying?

40:03.487 --> 40:06.689
I'm not going anywhere.

40:06.757 --> 40:09.425
I got your back, bro.

40:24.775 --> 40:26.509
Hey.

40:26.577 --> 40:28.811
I was wondering if you, uh...

40:28.879 --> 40:31.147
you wanted to come
to my sister's rehearsal dinner.

40:31.215 --> 40:33.182
The Intersect's out, Bartowski.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.818
You don't need my help anymore.

40:35.886 --> 40:37.253
I'm not asking you
as the Asset.

40:37.321 --> 40:38.755
I'm asking you as a friend.

40:45.062 --> 40:47.096
Okay, well, I tried.

40:50.334 --> 40:53.069
Open bar, I hope.

40:58.409 --> 40:59.876
I'll go warm up the Vic.

41:06.450 --> 41:07.850
Hi.

41:07.918 --> 41:09.352
Hi.

41:09.420 --> 41:11.454
You look amazing.

41:11.522 --> 41:13.423
Thank you.

41:13.490 --> 41:15.057
You look very dapper.

41:15.125 --> 41:17.393
Thank you.

41:17.461 --> 41:19.228
So how does
it feel?

41:19.296 --> 41:22.899
It feels great, actually.

41:22.966 --> 41:25.935
Like everything is finally real.

41:27.604 --> 41:29.405
It is real.

41:52.362 --> 41:54.497
Where you headed?

41:54.565 --> 41:56.766
Burbank.

41:56.834 --> 41:59.702
Got a wedding to go to.

42:07.744 --> 42:09.846
