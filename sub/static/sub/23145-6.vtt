00:02.469 --> 00:05.137
Today is our 10th Friendiversary.

00:05.139 --> 00:09.541
10 years ago, four kids entered
a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit

00:09.543 --> 00:13.077
as strangers, but they emerged...

00:14.414 --> 00:16.548
They emerged best friends.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.286
I promised myself I wouldn't do this!

00:21.288 --> 00:25.157
Let's skip the speech and
go straight to dessert.

Roger needs a squash partner!

01:00.661 --> 01:01.926
- Roger!
- Steve!

01:01.928 --> 01:03.796
Big squash tourney tomorrow.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.064
I need you to be my squash partner.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.131
Squash.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.733
I don't even know what squash is.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.003
What?! Everyone knows squash.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.204
- Roger.
- Squash.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.938
It's our Friendiversary.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.941
My week is jam-packed
with friendship activities.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.811
Jam-packed!

01:19.939 --> 01:22.681
- But, Steve...
- I'm not gonna ditch my friends.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.949
Sorry, you'll need to find
another squash partner.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.685
Everybody at the club is paired up,

01:26.687 --> 01:29.354
and the club doesn't allow blacks,
Jews, or women.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.357
That rules out my tennis partner,
Rashika Greenblatt.

01:32.359 --> 01:35.560
The racism is thick,
but so is the club's lobster bisque,

01:35.562 --> 01:38.163
which is why I'll never walk away.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.997
If you have the legendary shards,

02:12.999 --> 02:15.400
I recommend you visit Xur on Titan

02:15.402 --> 02:17.936
and purchase the Wardcliff
Coil Rocket Launcher.

02:19.406 --> 02:23.141
Then get the legendary shards,
you [BLEEP] licking suckboy!

02:23.143 --> 02:24.476
Third graders.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.744
I can't believe it.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.345
I asked Steve to play squash

02:27.347 --> 02:29.681
and he wouldn't cancel
plans with his friends.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.149
Those guys are tight, bro.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.218
They remind me of my boys in Tampa.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.753
You don't have friends in Tampa.

02:35.283 --> 02:36.621
Okay, pal.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.956
Then why do I have a tattoo

02:37.958 --> 02:41.025
of an alligator in a
bikini driving down I-4?

02:41.658 --> 02:43.495
Oh, you made me lose!

02:43.497 --> 02:47.432
Make him lose... his friends.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.834
Excellent idea, Klaus!

02:51.171 --> 02:54.573
Slow down, lady. Your son is a liar.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.509
What?! He was the one swearing at me,

02:57.511 --> 02:59.644
and he made a Chinese joke!

03:00.781 --> 03:03.448
Oh, w... well, I'm Chinese, too!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.788
Man, look at the splash back.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.790
Got that Super Soaker thrust.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.058
You're just painting those
<i>Entertainment Weekly's</i>

03:14.060 --> 03:15.475
in the magazine rack.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.996
Your flattery won't
get me to play squash.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.041
Squ-what?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.266
I haven't thought about that in ages.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.535
You seemed really into it,
like, 10 minutes ago.

03:24.786 --> 03:26.605
Speaking of minutes ago,

03:26.607 --> 03:28.807
how many has it been since Barry ate?

03:28.809 --> 03:31.075
What a fat guy, don't you think?

03:31.077 --> 03:32.477
He does struggle with weight,

03:32.479 --> 03:35.680
but I love my Care Bare, big or small.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.081
Speaking of small,

03:37.083 --> 03:39.818
what about Snot's bank account,
am I right?

03:39.820 --> 03:43.355
Oh, Snotter, so poor in money,
so rich in character.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.556
You're impossible.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.890
I'm not gonna keep recording over

03:45.892 --> 03:48.293
all my great business
ideas for this crap.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.964
<i>A novelty device that
transforms Julia Child's voice</i>

03:51.966 --> 03:54.366
<i>into a deep, scary monster voice.</i>

03:54.368 --> 03:55.968
<i>Oh, wait. Oh, wait, did I miss my stop?</i>

03:55.970 --> 03:58.303
<i>I'm looking for the ferry to Alcatraz.</i>

03:58.305 --> 04:00.172
<i>Or is it swimmable? I'm on a budget.</i>

04:00.174 --> 04:02.307
<i>This is my first time in San Francisco.</i>

04:02.309 --> 04:04.108
<i>That's not true. Why did I say that?</i>

04:04.650 --> 04:07.015
I almost lost this because of you!

04:11.251 --> 04:12.718
This is pretty interesting.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.986
Four 12-year-old kids
designed a computer

04:14.988 --> 04:17.055
that destroyed all of Cincinnati.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.524
- Wow.
- Oh, misread it.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.059
It was 412 1-year-olds.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.660
That's a lot less interesting.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.329
You guys aren't gonna believe this.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.463
Jeff has a talent!

04:25.465 --> 04:26.998
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.800
We were just watching
the house-renovation show

04:28.802 --> 04:31.269
"Flip or Flop,"
and Jeff knew when to flip

04:31.271 --> 04:33.071
and he knew when to flop.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.473
- I did.
- How is this possible?

04:35.475 --> 04:38.143
Mom, when you look around the house,
what do you see?

04:38.606 --> 04:39.677
Walls.

04:39.679 --> 04:40.812
Just a lot of walls.

04:41.504 --> 04:43.148
Walls. What a noob.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.417
What do we see, Jeff, you and I?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.285
When I look at a house,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.755
I can see beyond the walls...

04:49.757 --> 04:52.023
- Uh-huh.
- ...above the ceiling...

04:52.025 --> 04:54.159
- That's right.
- ...and below the floor.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.829
- Bingo.
- I can see its bones.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.297
Happy now, Francine?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.300
If we combine his instincts
with your money,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.769
the sky's the limit.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.637
The sky, you say?

05:06.907 --> 05:10.108
He's surveying the bones of our house.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.444
He is? Well, don't hold out on us, Jeff.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.845
What do you see?

05:17.851 --> 05:21.920
Your house has great bones.

05:22.765 --> 05:24.856
Wow, he's good.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.458
Do me, do me! How are my bones?

05:29.358 --> 05:31.329
You're not a house, Mr. S.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.999
A goddamn master.

05:34.753 --> 05:36.290
_

05:37.091 --> 05:38.604
Kick those legs, Barry!

05:38.606 --> 05:41.073
I can't do it! Swan!

05:42.075 --> 05:44.409
I'll never learn to swim.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.111
Barry.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.679
Barry.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.949
Stop making me laugh.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.484
There's that smile!

05:52.486 --> 05:55.287
Aww, I love you guys.

05:55.289 --> 05:58.556
Steve, I set up a cabana
and filled it with strippers.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.091
Roger, go away.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.251
It's Friendiversary swim day.

06:02.286 --> 06:05.497
Why don't you come over here
and swim into some strange?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.500
This is Steve, the underage boy
I was telling you about.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.368
You really don't get it, huh?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.770
These are my friends,

06:11.772 --> 06:13.639
and I'll never turn my back on them.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.707
You can tell yourself that,
but you'll slip up,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.843
just like I told myself
I was never gonna see

06:17.845 --> 06:19.845
another Woody Allen movie,
but there I was,

06:19.847 --> 06:21.847
first in line for "Blue Jasmine."

06:21.849 --> 06:24.316
So boring, so good.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.919
This neighborhood looks kind of seedy.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.522
Is that a Satanic church next door?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.458
They practice Santería.

06:32.460 --> 06:36.394
I don't know the difference,
but I'm told there is one.

06:37.098 --> 06:38.664
Has anyone died in here?

06:38.666 --> 06:40.532
It feels like someone died in here.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.200
No! God no.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.136
The last owner was stabbed in the house,

06:44.138 --> 06:47.673
but he managed to crawl
to the lawn before he died.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.607
Jeff, tell us about the house.

06:49.609 --> 06:54.346
Quite possibly the greatest
bones I've ever seen.

06:54.348 --> 06:56.682
Let's see them bones!

06:56.684 --> 06:59.017
What the hell are you doing?!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.752
You know what? Screw it.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.355
I'm quitting this industry.

07:03.357 --> 07:07.693
I have quit a lot of industries, though.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.361
I'm reconsidering.

07:09.363 --> 07:13.031
Guess what. I'm back, babies!

07:13.033 --> 07:15.501
Aah!

07:15.503 --> 07:18.303
You know what? I'm quitting this body.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.840
I have quit a lot of bodies, though.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.042
I'm reconsidering.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.116
10 years ago, we met within the hallowed

07:31.118 --> 07:34.452
and ultimately unprofitable
walls of this Chuck E. Cheese.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.523
The ball pit gave life
to our friendship.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.991
But it also gave life to a super fungus

07:39.993 --> 07:41.993
that blinded an entire
Little League team

07:41.995 --> 07:43.929
and closed the doors forever.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.532
And now we immortalize our friendship

07:46.534 --> 07:48.233
with some light vandalism.

07:49.467 --> 07:52.974
_

07:52.975 --> 07:54.375
_

07:54.474 --> 07:56.942
Ugh, Toshi, that sucks.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.410
That's right, Banksy.

07:58.412 --> 08:01.012
"American Dad's" calling you a hack!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.148
Reveal your identity and fight us.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.317
"American Dad"... We are...

08:05.318 --> 08:07.294
_

08:08.472 --> 08:11.423
Who disturbs my slumber?

08:13.627 --> 08:15.493
Aah!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.230
You vandalized my beautiful home!

08:18.232 --> 08:19.497
It wasn't my idea!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.077
Uh, Snot, Barry,
and Toshi made me do it!

08:22.112 --> 08:24.796
Whoa, you turned
on your friends so fast.

08:24.831 --> 08:27.773
- I didn't even get to...
- ...clamp your balls in a mouse trap.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.441
Clamp their balls, not mine!

08:29.443 --> 08:32.443
T-They can't be far.
I'll... I'll help you find them.

08:32.446 --> 08:35.113
Toshi lives closest.
I say we go there first.

08:36.014 --> 08:37.582
And we can trap Barry with food.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.385
He'll eat himself to death
like a goldfish.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.520
There's a lot of fight in Snot,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.188
but we can nab him when he's weakest...

08:44.191 --> 08:46.392
Right after he sells his plasma.

08:47.339 --> 08:49.394
Nah, I've got rat stuff to do.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.063
Good luck digging yourself
out of this hole, Steve.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.599
How do you know my name?

08:53.601 --> 08:54.733
Uh...

08:54.735 --> 08:56.802
Chuck E. Cheese knows

08:56.804 --> 08:58.437
all the children's names.

09:02.476 --> 09:06.612
So... should we report
the guy in the rat costume

09:06.614 --> 09:08.097
assaulting kids?

09:08.132 --> 09:11.950
I'm more concerned about
the rat in the guy costume

09:11.952 --> 09:14.019
assaulting friendships.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.954
- Snotter...
- Don't Snotter me.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.489
You betrayed us!

09:17.491 --> 09:21.559
I haven't felt this betrayed
since "Scrubs" moved to ABC!

09:21.561 --> 09:24.430
How old were you when that happened?

09:24.432 --> 09:28.634
Well, how old am I now and when
was that, and now subtract.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.235
Think, Snot. Think!

09:30.237 --> 09:33.687
This bad blood... this is on you!

09:35.259 --> 09:37.470
Snot, please take me back as a friend.

09:37.505 --> 09:39.144
I can't get Bluetooth to sync,

09:39.146 --> 09:42.280
but pretend it's playing
your favorite Matisyahu song.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.749
So I should just pretend

09:43.751 --> 09:47.553
his entire catalogue is
playing at the same time?

09:47.555 --> 09:48.686
Fat chance!

09:49.199 --> 09:52.558
You backstabbed us
during Friendiversary!

09:55.563 --> 09:56.828
0-for-3.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.232
I'd say you're 3-for-3
at losing your friends.

10:00.234 --> 10:01.367
Perfect record, bud.

10:01.369 --> 10:03.569
Thanks for putting
a positive spin on it.

10:03.571 --> 10:05.771
Looks like you're the
only friend I have left.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.840
We all make mistakes,
but life is like a game of squash.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.175
You got to keep on whackin'.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.444
I forgot all about your tournament.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.780
- Rotten Steve!
- You stop that right now.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.982
I doubt there's even time
to enter the tournament.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.651
Well, we could make the cutoff.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.453
But we wouldn't be able
to take my friend Nancy's

10:21.455 --> 10:23.388
hot aerobics class before.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.590
Would you be willing to play

10:24.592 --> 10:26.592
without taking Nancy's
hot aerobics, Steve?

10:26.594 --> 10:28.460
Honestly, we won't be as loose.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.196
Okay. I'll be your squash partner.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.398
You're giving me a second
chance at friendship,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.601
and this time, I'm gonna do it right.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.735
- Oh!
- You're doing it wrong!

10:37.737 --> 10:39.737
Damn it, Steve, clear a path!

10:39.739 --> 10:40.939
You got it, friend.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.540
Get a clue, Steve.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.009
[BLEEP]

10:44.011 --> 10:45.944
Well played, Chip. Your serve.

10:46.408 --> 10:48.747
Hey, Rog,
the kid's all covered in welts.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.548
- Your serve, Chip.
- How about we call it?

10:50.550 --> 10:51.750
How about you serve, Chip?

10:53.287 --> 10:55.988
Okay, Steve,
clear that path and we got this.

10:59.801 --> 11:05.580
Clear a path!

11:06.566 --> 11:08.566
Path!

11:08.568 --> 11:11.203
Clear it!

11:12.772 --> 11:13.805
Aah!

11:13.807 --> 11:15.374
[BLEEP]

11:17.856 --> 11:19.978
Hell of a game.
Nice backhand today, Bob.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.379
My partner just didn't have it.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.848
Is he gonna be okay?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.182
Are you gonna be okay?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.051
Hey, you just worry
about the next round.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.320
Go win this thing.

11:28.978 --> 11:30.856
What are we doing next?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.057
I don't understand.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.459
You're acting like we're friends,

11:33.461 --> 11:36.128
but you're bad at squash.
What am I missing here?

11:36.130 --> 11:38.330
You're missing high-quality backpacks

11:38.332 --> 11:40.265
made out of recycled materials!

11:40.267 --> 11:41.933
- I am?
- "I am?"

11:42.616 --> 11:44.736
Just kidding.
Step inside. I'll hook you up.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.538
- Steve, I'm gonna do this.
- I'll come with.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.223
"I'll come with."

11:48.408 --> 11:51.209
- You're worse than this guy.
- You stay.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.245
You are really funny.

11:59.487 --> 12:01.753
They don't make bones like this anymore.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.689
Damn right. So, what's the next step?

12:03.691 --> 12:06.558
- Renovations?
- And cover up these bones?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.961
Mr. S, are you the stupidest
person I've ever met?

12:09.963 --> 12:11.829
- Jeff!
- No, he's right.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.765
I spoke out of turn. Go on, Jeff.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.767
It's time to flip this house,

12:15.769 --> 12:19.905
and I recommend we only
consider all-cash offers.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.508
A goddamn master.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.779
I wish you weren't married, Chip.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.849
I bet your wife doesn't do this, Chip.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.386
Wakey, wakey.

12:34.388 --> 12:36.054
I made you breakfast in bed.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.789
It's cold because
it's almost dinnertime.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.592
- Okay, we need to talk.
- Best friend talk.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.660
- Shut up and listen to me.
- Best friend listen.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.996
Our so-called "friendship" was based on

12:44.998 --> 12:48.200
a mutual love of squash,
which you didn't share.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.735
This is over.

12:49.737 --> 12:51.537
But... But you're my only friend!

12:51.539 --> 12:53.471
No. Now clear a path.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.895
Sure thing, buddy.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.809
See? We can make this work.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.412
You've got a clingy friend
on your hands, bro.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.749
I'm gonna head over to the pier
and work on my robot man routine.

13:03.751 --> 13:05.884
Everything will be normal
by the time I get back.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.221
Ahh, there's so many
sick piers in Tampa.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.889
My boy Vance basically lives there.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.825
He makes bank selling
butterfly knives to tourists.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.961
Nobody believes you
have friends in Tampa.

13:16.964 --> 13:21.299
Oh, yeah? Then where did I
get skin cancer, smart guy?

13:23.703 --> 13:27.305
Beep, boop, beep, beep, boop.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.441
Beep, boop, boop, beep...

13:29.443 --> 13:31.376
Dad, that robot wants money.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.512
...beep, beep, boop, boop, beep...

13:34.514 --> 13:37.049
Stay away from him.
These guys have diseases.

13:37.051 --> 13:38.384
Shut up! You don't know me.

13:38.386 --> 13:40.518
You're just a lucky guesser.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.987
Beep, boop, beep...

13:41.989 --> 13:44.656
I'm Robot Man's best friend, Gold Boy.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.991
It's me... Steve.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.926
Get lost, Gold Boy.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.261
No can do.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.729
I'm your sidekick for all eternity.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.198
And in real life, too.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.066
- Beep, boop!
- Aah!

13:55.068 --> 13:56.124
Beep.

14:00.408 --> 14:02.274
Hello! Welcome.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.476
So, it's protective booties
for everyone.

14:04.478 --> 14:06.412
- I'm sure you've noticed the bones.
- Huh?

14:06.414 --> 14:08.146
So, we're asking potential buyers

14:08.148 --> 14:11.416
for a heartfelt letter outlining
why you should get the house.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.486
Sorry, I thought
this house was abandoned.

14:14.488 --> 14:15.954
See, my girlfriend has diarrhea,

14:15.956 --> 14:17.923
and I wanted to shoot up a little.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.493
Damn it! No one wants this house.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.229
Nobody cares about bones.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.031
Jeff screwed us!

14:26.033 --> 14:27.966
Jeffrey, is this true?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.167
Did you screw us?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.768
Looks like I did, Mr. S.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.504
Okay, you can kill him.

14:32.506 --> 14:33.772
Run, babe!

14:33.774 --> 14:37.209
We're all gonna need fresh
booties to go back in!

14:43.587 --> 14:44.916
I can't get rid of Steve.

14:45.883 --> 14:48.053
Courtney, my boy in Tampa,

14:48.055 --> 14:49.455
he had a clinger like this.

14:49.457 --> 14:50.922
Florida State girl.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.057
You know how that goes.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.791
Actually, I don't, and neither do you

14:53.793 --> 14:55.327
because none of those people exist.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.062
I have an actual crisis!

14:57.064 --> 14:58.464
What did you expect?

14:58.466 --> 15:02.000
You blew up his entire support
system for a squash partner.

15:02.258 --> 15:03.535
Roger, you in there?

15:03.537 --> 15:05.603
- You going wee-wee?
- What do I do, Klaus?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.539
Instead of losing Steve,

15:07.541 --> 15:11.409
you should be reuniting
him with his old friends.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.280
Peek-a-boo!

15:15.808 --> 15:17.749
Aah! You got me, buddy!

15:17.751 --> 15:20.018
How can I reunite Steve and his friends?

15:20.020 --> 15:22.554
Well, to learn about that,
you have to learn about friendship,

15:22.556 --> 15:24.490
and if you want to
learn about friendship,

15:24.492 --> 15:26.892
we have to go to Tampa.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.027
There's no way you
have friends in Tampa.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.629
But a little trip to get away
from Steve, I'm in.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.832
Pack for the heat.
You got any tank tops?

15:33.834 --> 15:36.702
I have a framed sleeveless
Aaron Rodgers jersey.

15:36.704 --> 15:38.837
Hmm. Do you own a glass cutter?

15:38.839 --> 15:40.972
I do, but it's also framed.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.107
Okay, grab both frames

15:42.109 --> 15:44.115
and we'll figure it out
on the way to the airport.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.752
Steve won't stop texting.

15:53.754 --> 15:56.221
"In line at a goat cheese sale.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.488
Pick you up a log?"

15:57.490 --> 15:59.224
Can you believe this guy?

15:59.226 --> 16:00.492
"Two logs."

16:00.494 --> 16:01.893
Relax.

16:01.895 --> 16:04.563
Steve just has to reunite
with his old friends,

16:04.565 --> 16:07.098
and once you see how
tight me and my boys are,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.300
you'll know how to make that happen.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.304
Now stop worrying and take
in these Florida swamps.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.440
Wow, so these are the people

16:15.442 --> 16:17.976
who decide who's president every time.

16:18.538 --> 16:21.246
We gon' make Hulk Hogan president!

16:21.248 --> 16:23.482
You know best!

16:26.720 --> 16:28.119
There's a doorbell.

16:30.591 --> 16:31.923
When you show up at a friend's house,

16:31.925 --> 16:34.393
make sure you bring a fancy gift.

16:34.395 --> 16:36.995
Here, give these blunt wraps to Big Ed.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.997
You're gonna love these dudes.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.566
They're so funny.

16:41.869 --> 16:43.102
'Sup?

16:43.204 --> 16:45.737
'Sup?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.606
Whoa, no way.

16:47.608 --> 16:50.209
Your friends <i> are</i> real.

16:50.211 --> 16:53.678
Look at this.
There's an inside, and more guys!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.947
This is my boy, Roger. He's chill.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.816
He's here to learn about friendship.

16:57.818 --> 16:59.418
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

16:59.420 --> 17:02.021
Whoa, Klaus' stories are for real?

17:02.023 --> 17:05.290
I can't believe it.
Astroturf rug... check.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.358
Unlicensed exotic animal storage...
check.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.694
The fan that's never on

17:09.695 --> 17:12.897
despite it being 120 degrees in here...
check.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.767
But surely the torn poster
was a work of fiction.

17:16.388 --> 17:17.569
The torn poster!

17:17.570 --> 17:19.771
In all its glory.

17:19.772 --> 17:23.040
Please, please take me
to the toilet Big Ed cracked

17:23.042 --> 17:24.710
when he sat on it backwards.

17:25.056 --> 17:26.845
What the hell are you doing out there?

17:26.847 --> 17:28.713
What? I was chill.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.781
Was I not chill?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.516
No, you're being all crazy.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.052
What was that bullshit about the fan?

17:33.054 --> 17:35.186
I told you that in confidence.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.287
Okay, sorry.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.156
I'm chill now.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.391
Holy [BLEEP] is that the water moccasin

17:40.393 --> 17:43.728
Vance took to the Orlando premier of
"Scary Movie 4"?!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.196
Pull yourself together, man.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.532
Grab a room-temperature
Otterpop from the lighter drawer

17:47.534 --> 17:50.269
and just... cool out.

17:50.271 --> 17:52.871
I'll go try to smooth
it over with the guys.

17:54.350 --> 17:55.540
Roger, where are you going?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.742
We haven't solved your Steve problem.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.279
I think I got my problem solved.

and then I invited your
friends to play Marco Polo

19:05.412 --> 19:07.346
with Olympic great Michael Phelps.

19:07.348 --> 19:09.881
People will believe anything
in a Facebook invite.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.150
Fake news!

19:11.152 --> 19:12.951
Oh, my God, why would you do that?!

19:12.953 --> 19:16.822
So you can save their lives
and prove your loyalty.

19:18.759 --> 19:20.959
Go get your friends back.

19:20.961 --> 19:22.894
When Michael Phelps shows up,

19:22.896 --> 19:25.831
please don't tell him I'm
sitting on six pool noodles.

19:26.483 --> 19:27.566
Get out of the pool!

19:27.568 --> 19:29.234
There's a deadly snake!

19:29.236 --> 19:30.569
Save it, Steve.

19:30.571 --> 19:31.837
I know I betrayed you,

19:31.839 --> 19:33.172
but you got to believe me!

19:33.174 --> 19:34.506
Save it.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.975
You don't need to pretend
to save our lives.

19:36.977 --> 19:39.310
We already forgive you, Steve.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.912
What? Y-You do?

19:40.914 --> 19:42.113
We got to talking,

19:42.115 --> 19:44.383
and a giant rat grabbing us,

19:44.385 --> 19:46.018
we all would've blabbed.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.967
_

19:50.524 --> 19:53.258
I can't believe I got
my best friends back.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.394
You were saying something about a snake?

19:55.396 --> 19:56.728
Oh, my God, the snake!

19:56.730 --> 19:58.797
What's taking so long?

20:01.468 --> 20:03.134
Loud batch of Natty Ice.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.003
Oh, I dumped the wrong cooler.

20:05.890 --> 20:07.939
There's no snake in here.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.742
Roger must've lied to reunite us.

20:10.744 --> 20:12.644
Guys, look! I'm swimming!

20:14.615 --> 20:17.616
It's a Friendiversary miracle!

20:18.085 --> 20:19.618
Snake!

20:24.025 --> 20:25.124
Man down!

20:26.827 --> 20:29.328
We need to find the bite
and suck out the venom!

20:31.069 --> 20:33.197
Ooh!

20:33.291 --> 20:34.633
Inner thigh.

20:35.564 --> 20:36.635
I'll do it.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.770
No. We're best friends,

20:38.772 --> 20:42.441
and we'll all suck out the venom.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.315
I think I finally understand friendship.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.984
And so ends

20:52.986 --> 20:58.590
the greatest love story ever told.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.359
Have a great night!

21:02.484 --> 21:04.537
