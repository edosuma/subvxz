WEBVTT

00:01.698 --> 00:05.068
Figuring out why you
both chose what you did

00:05.068 --> 00:08.073
will allowed the
relationship to go forward.

00:08.073 --> 00:10.317
Will you both consider a little time apart?

00:10.317 --> 00:12.747
It might give Cate the
emotional space she needs.

00:12.747 --> 00:13.871
Ryan.

00:14.241 --> 00:15.627
You still owe me one.

00:15.627 --> 00:17.711
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

00:18.296 --> 00:19.876
- You're...
- A teacher.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.795
Minnesota? What does that mean?

00:22.795 --> 00:24.333
Is the whole state calling you?

00:24.772 --> 00:25.441
Hello.

00:25.441 --> 00:27.074
Who's that? Your boyfriend?

00:27.074 --> 00:28.450
Did you go through my stuff?

00:28.450 --> 00:30.500
I went to Valerie's.
Tasha gave me the address.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.137
What did Valerie tell you?

00:32.137 --> 00:33.473
You know, that you
were violent with them,

00:33.473 --> 00:35.099
that you hit her husband...

00:35.099 --> 00:36.183
Lux!

00:36.183 --> 00:38.203
I'm the violent one?

00:38.203 --> 00:40.139
That's what you told Cate?

00:40.139 --> 00:41.591
Get the hell off my property!

00:50.283 --> 00:51.902
Sam just moved here from Madison.

00:51.902 --> 00:53.957
So you're from Wisconsin?

00:55.068 --> 00:56.795
I was at boarding school there.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.079
Ah. Minnesota.

00:59.079 --> 01:00.913
We're practically neighbors.

01:00.913 --> 01:01.954
Huh.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.836
Minnesota.

01:06.166 --> 01:10.141
I think... I'm gonna like it here.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.612
The finance industry
doesn't have Thanksgiving.

01:27.612 --> 01:29.501
We have the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year.

01:29.501 --> 01:32.531
So, when STF launches its IPO,

01:32.531 --> 01:35.089
we need to calculate the NPV.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.469
I'll need a... P&L statement.

01:39.973 --> 01:43.729
You know, you're very sexy
when you talk alphabet.

01:52.171 --> 01:53.464
Emma, got a minute?

01:53.464 --> 01:54.765
Absolutely.

01:54.765 --> 01:55.695
We were just...

01:55.695 --> 01:57.524
Examining balance
sheets for long term

01:57.524 --> 01:58.929
versus short term debts.

01:58.929 --> 02:00.697
And, yes, I can get the
cash flow statements

02:00.697 --> 02:02.179
for you before closing today.

02:02.179 --> 02:03.395
Listen to you.

02:03.395 --> 02:04.943
I knew you'd be a natural at this.

02:04.943 --> 02:06.895
Chip off the old block, isn't he?

02:06.895 --> 02:08.114
No comment.

02:08.114 --> 02:10.164
I need this evaluated
by Friday morning.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.305
I hope it doesn't affect
your Thanksgiving plans.

02:12.305 --> 02:14.611
You know me. Work is
my Thanksgiving plan.

02:16.393 --> 02:18.009
Oh, uh, you sure you and Lux

02:18.009 --> 02:19.822
don't want to join your
mom and me in Aruba?

02:20.279 --> 02:21.447
Thanks, dad,

02:21.447 --> 02:25.278
but something about snorkeling
and turkey that seems gross.

02:26.016 --> 02:27.169
Plus, I want to give Lux

02:27.169 --> 02:28.977
her first real Thanksgiving,
you know?

02:28.977 --> 02:31.352
Too much food, too much family...

02:31.352 --> 02:33.093
Remember how we used to toss

02:33.093 --> 02:34.796
a football around,
the first person who dropped it

02:34.796 --> 02:36.257
they got stuck with the dishes?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.587
Made you a better football player.

02:37.587 --> 02:39.109
And a lousy dishwasher.

02:39.109 --> 02:40.253
But it was fun.

02:40.857 --> 02:42.608
We'll bring Lux a souvenir.

02:43.516 --> 02:45.137
Don't work too hard.

02:53.333 --> 02:54.218
That was close.

02:54.218 --> 02:55.805
If your dad knew we were dating...

02:55.805 --> 02:57.287
No, you know.

02:57.642 --> 02:59.020
Maybe he'd be cool with it.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.337
We could be all over each
other at the office parties.

03:01.337 --> 03:02.951
We could do it on
the copy machine.

03:02.951 --> 03:05.229
You could come over
for Thanksgiving.

03:05.229 --> 03:08.201
- I already told you that's
a bad idea. - I know.

03:08.201 --> 03:09.509
Because it's a family holiday,

03:09.509 --> 03:11.246
and my family happens
to be your boss,

03:11.246 --> 03:14.175
who also happens to be going
halfway around the world.

03:14.563 --> 03:17.288
Does company policy
mean anything to you?

03:17.288 --> 03:19.043
We could get fired for dating.

03:19.043 --> 03:21.763
Right, right, but everyone who's

03:21.763 --> 03:23.179
coming over for Thanksgiving

03:23.179 --> 03:25.589
already knows we're
dating and can't fire us.

03:25.589 --> 03:27.111
Comforting thought.

03:27.111 --> 03:30.168
Look, I know we have to be
discreet at work, I get it,

03:30.168 --> 03:33.265
but I cannot keep my life in
neat little boxes like you.

03:33.265 --> 03:34.877
I'm more of a junk
drawer type of guy,

03:34.877 --> 03:38.201
and I want all the people that
I care about to be together.

03:39.057 --> 03:40.758
And you're one of those people.

03:46.942 --> 03:47.669
All right.

03:49.009 --> 03:50.437
What should I bring?

03:50.754 --> 03:52.998
And by bring, I mean buy.

03:56.802 --> 03:59.607
Baze is making a turkey
the size of a toddler.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.747
'Cause that image makes me hungry.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.255
We'll eat a ton at Baze's,
then go to Cate's.

04:04.255 --> 04:05.254
She'll probably try to cook,

04:05.254 --> 04:07.286
mess it up, and then order chinnese.

04:07.286 --> 04:09.363
Yeah, maybe I'll get a
fortune cookie that says:

04:09.363 --> 04:10.779
"Hey, don't worry about that guy

04:10.779 --> 04:12.093
"you hit over the
head with a shovel;

04:12.093 --> 04:14.087
- ...you're not totally screwed".
- We're not screwed.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.299
I called and checked on trey.

04:15.299 --> 04:16.684
He only spent one
night in the hospital.

04:16.684 --> 04:18.831
So I'm sure he's probably fine.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.060
If he hasn't made
trouble for us yet,

04:21.060 --> 04:22.524
I don't think it's going to.

04:22.524 --> 04:25.763
Yeah, that's what they said
about the pilgrims.

04:25.763 --> 04:28.684
Bad stuff? That's all behind us.

04:28.684 --> 04:31.880
Except for Cate sweet potato casserole.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.159
Sorry.

04:41.159 --> 04:43.201
Dont worry about it,

04:43.202 --> 04:46.202
What's a little hit and run
between friends, rigth?

04:46.472 --> 04:47.949
Lux? You got a minute?

04:47.949 --> 04:49.839
Oh, your boyfriend's calling you.

04:59.207 --> 05:02.990
Hey, I just want to want to give you
a heads about Math invite's to go
to Baze's in Thanksgiving

05:02.990 --> 05:07.321
- And you are actually coming?
- What I could get out of it, Matk known
I was gonna be alone and wouldn't let it go.

05:07.453 --> 05:10.867
Really, cuz Math couln't apply
pressure to a papercut.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.589
ok, I admitted, I want to be there.

05:15.589 --> 05:22.155
I like Thanksgiving, I like the food
and I like the excuse to be with you.

05:24.488 --> 05:25.793
Me too.

05:50.401 --> 05:51.644
Yellow.

05:52.413 --> 05:55.279
You know there's this crazy new
invention called the door bell?

05:55.279 --> 05:58.152
You use it when you enter a
house where you dont live.

05:58.152 --> 06:00.853
Yeah, they also invented
something called cellphone,

06:00.853 --> 06:02.865
but only works if you turn it on.

06:04.636 --> 06:07.967
So, I need to swap
dinner time with you

06:07.967 --> 06:09.746
- Uh, no.
- Why?

06:09.991 --> 06:14.453
Sorry, you got early dinner,
and I got late dinner.

06:14.453 --> 06:18.135
I have more people coming over
and I bought monster turkey
which is never be cook in time

06:18.227 --> 06:19.694
You know, I making a toon food too,

06:19.694 --> 06:21.309
and I can't cook any faster either.

06:21.309 --> 06:22.320
You cooking?

06:22.320 --> 06:25.439
Cause Lux said you
probably order Chinese

06:27.222 --> 06:28.674
That's great.

06:29.209 --> 06:33.135
And I suppose you'll have a
perfect dinner with Lux
and I supposed to be
stucked in the house

06:34.135 --> 06:36.439
while my mom drinks and my sister,
who still thinks it's 2008,

06:36.439 --> 06:39.081
puts on "Single Ladies" and
tries to teach us the dance.

06:39.081 --> 06:40.816
That's great.

06:41.445 --> 06:43.616
Fine. You bring Abby,
you bring Laverne,

06:43.616 --> 06:45.914
and we can all have
Thanksgiving at my place.

06:45.914 --> 06:47.840
They can put a ring on it there.

06:48.347 --> 06:51.778
Look, we both want to give Lux
her first real Thanksgiving.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.083
It's not fair to put
her in the middle.

06:55.597 --> 06:58.684
- Well, who else is going
to be there? - Not Paige.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.896
And Ryan will be having
Thanksgiving with his mom,

07:01.896 --> 07:03.648
if that's what
you're worried about.

07:05.974 --> 07:06.998
Well, that's good.

07:06.998 --> 07:08.105
That's good?

07:08.105 --> 07:10.883
Aren't you two supposed to
be trying to work things out?

07:10.883 --> 07:12.574
Yeah, we're trying.

07:15.587 --> 07:17.863
Yeah, it was supposed to be our
first Thanksgiving together.

07:17.863 --> 07:19.888
Guess what, bright side,

07:19.888 --> 07:21.941
it'll be our first
Thanksgiving together. Sorry.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.150
What's the bright side?

07:23.150 --> 07:25.883
Wow, easy there, mood swing.

07:25.883 --> 07:29.475
I don't think I've seen you
this volatile since high school.

07:29.475 --> 07:31.034
You can go now.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.690
Are you okay? 'Cause you
look a little pekid.

07:32.690 --> 07:35.435
Okay. Out!

07:37.397 --> 07:38.188
Okay.

07:38.188 --> 07:39.596
Hey, Cate,

07:40.033 --> 07:41.309
don't be late.

08:07.364 --> 08:10.018
You and Mr. Daniels
look cute together,

08:10.018 --> 08:11.720
kind of like inmate and jail bait.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.825
Whatever it is you think
you know, you're wrong.

08:13.825 --> 08:15.529
I think I know enough.

08:17.028 --> 08:18.530
Did you know that I
got an incomplete

08:18.530 --> 08:20.525
in English from last school

08:20.525 --> 08:22.156
and your boyfriend
wants me to do a ton

08:22.156 --> 08:23.771
of make-up work over Thanksgiving.

08:23.771 --> 08:24.859
Well, that sucks for you.

08:24.859 --> 08:26.747
- Yeah, it would unless...
- Unless what?

08:26.747 --> 08:29.032
Unless you get him to
give me a passing grade

08:29.032 --> 08:30.960
without me having to
do any of the work.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.760
Are you... are you serious?

08:32.760 --> 08:35.183
Well, I can't talk Eric...

08:35.183 --> 08:36.621
Mr. Daniels, into doing that for you.

08:36.621 --> 08:37.799
I think you can.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.366
Unless you and Eric... Mr. Daniels

08:40.366 --> 08:42.482
want it to come out
that you're dating.

08:43.611 --> 08:44.910
Hey, I shouldn't even have to ask.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.052
I covered for you with Cate,

08:46.052 --> 08:47.068
I took the blame for the crash,

08:47.068 --> 08:48.607
you owe me one.

08:54.096 --> 08:55.308
Well, it says on the box

08:55.308 --> 08:58.188
that your-your home pregnancy
tests aren't 100% accurate,

08:58.188 --> 09:00.533
so, you know, even if it's
say that I'm pregnant,

09:00.533 --> 09:02.620
you could be wrong, right?

09:03.132 --> 09:04.318
No, it's not a user error.

09:04.318 --> 09:05.627
I know how to take
a pregnancy test.

09:05.627 --> 09:08.002
I have been accidentally
pregnant before.

09:08.002 --> 09:10.946
Oh, yeah? Well, how about
you use a condom next time?

09:11.797 --> 09:13.082
Jerk.

www.Addic7ed.com

09:54.937 --> 09:56.196
Oh, Cate,

09:56.196 --> 09:58.845
you made something with more
than three ingredients in it.

09:58.845 --> 10:01.111
Mmm, honey, I don't know why
you do this to yourself.

10:01.111 --> 10:03.018
My Thanksgiving side dish

10:03.018 --> 10:04.325
is a jug of martinis.

10:04.325 --> 10:05.572
Always a hit.

10:05.572 --> 10:09.196
Yeah, okay, I just wanted to
make something special for Lux.

10:09.196 --> 10:11.152
I'm not going to let
Baze steal the limelight

10:11.152 --> 10:13.144
with his giant bird.

10:13.144 --> 10:15.307
I'm familiar with
Baze's giant bird.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.852
It's not all that.

10:18.639 --> 10:19.268
Girls, please,

10:19.268 --> 10:21.966
it's a little early to
hear about your sex lives.

10:21.966 --> 10:23.488
- Breakfast wine?
- Yes.

10:23.488 --> 10:25.003
Uh, no, I am good.

10:31.193 --> 10:33.114
Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

10:33.114 --> 10:34.364
No, I'm not.

10:34.364 --> 10:35.609
I knew your boobs looked big.

10:35.609 --> 10:37.414
I thought that was just
a really great bra!

10:37.414 --> 10:39.222
Hey, just because I don't want
to have alcohol first thing

10:39.222 --> 10:40.804
in the morning does not
mean that I'm pregnant.

10:40.804 --> 10:42.862
You are both being ridiculous.

10:51.206 --> 10:52.124
Okay.

10:52.124 --> 10:53.200
Oh, wow.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.894
You cannot say anything

10:55.894 --> 10:57.118
to anyone.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.030
Is it Ryan's?

11:02.098 --> 11:03.715
Of course it is Ryan's.

11:03.715 --> 11:04.950
Then why can't we say anything?

11:04.950 --> 11:06.439
Because Ryan doesn't know yet.

11:06.439 --> 11:07.806
- Cate!
- It's not because

11:07.806 --> 11:08.686
I'm lying to him.

11:08.686 --> 11:10.668
I'm just not 100% sure
that I'm pregnant.

11:10.668 --> 11:12.816
All I did was pee on a stick.

11:14.491 --> 11:16.191
Four sticks.

11:17.703 --> 11:19.970
You think you're going to blow up again?
Remember last time?

11:19.970 --> 11:21.489
It was like your face
expanding sideways.

11:21.489 --> 11:23.132
Abby, shut up.

11:23.795 --> 11:25.168
I don't want to talk
about this again

11:25.168 --> 11:26.312
until I go to the doctor,

11:26.312 --> 11:28.786
I get the results and I
am sure that it's true.

11:28.786 --> 11:31.103
And if it is, then what?

11:31.492 --> 11:34.039
Look, I want Ryan to move home,
but because of this.

11:34.039 --> 11:36.855
Not when our entire
marriage is a total mess.

11:36.855 --> 11:38.038
And not telling him the truth,

11:38.038 --> 11:39.969
it's not even an issue.

11:40.943 --> 11:42.984
Because Ryan is not going
to be at Thanksgiving.

11:42.984 --> 11:44.230
I can't look him in the eye

11:44.230 --> 11:46.340
and lie to him if I'm
not going to see him.

11:47.859 --> 11:49.551
Like anyone is going
to look you in the eye

11:49.551 --> 11:51.527
with those ginormous boobs.

11:54.678 --> 11:55.600
Sorry.

12:11.223 --> 12:12.433
What many people don't know about

12:12.433 --> 12:13.890
the Macy's Thanksgiving
day parade,

12:13.890 --> 12:16.052
formally known as the
Christmas parade,

12:16.052 --> 12:19.383
is that it originated in
1924 using live animals

12:19.383 --> 12:20.857
borrowed from the zoo.

12:21.264 --> 12:22.896
What, are we going to
get a test on this?

12:22.896 --> 12:24.278
No. Maybe.

12:25.485 --> 12:26.168
Sorry.

12:26.168 --> 12:28.161
Probably feels weird
having Thanksgiving

12:28.161 --> 12:30.035
with two of your teachers.

12:30.035 --> 12:31.750
Today think of us as just

12:31.750 --> 12:33.177
a couple of guys.

12:33.177 --> 12:34.522
Like uncles.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.008
Ew.

12:36.452 --> 12:38.740
No, I think it's cool to
have teachers as friends.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.609
Never know when you're
going to need a favor

12:40.609 --> 12:43.567
or a better grade, hypothetically.

12:44.511 --> 12:47.556
All right, I, uh,
I put a candle in the bathroom

12:47.556 --> 12:49.022
to mitigate the smell of guys.

12:49.022 --> 12:51.881
So light it, use it, love it.

12:52.255 --> 12:53.141
Oh...

12:56.673 --> 12:58.290
Hey, that's Paige's.

12:58.290 --> 12:59.560
God, it's like picking up the

12:59.560 --> 13:02.056
droppings of a playboy bunny.

13:03.387 --> 13:06.535
Who... who ate all
my fancy mixed nuts?

13:07.522 --> 13:09.023
Those are for Emma.

13:09.023 --> 13:11.233
- Emma's coming?
- Yeah, with Sam.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.162
What?

13:12.162 --> 13:13.738
Hide your car keys.

13:13.738 --> 13:15.294
Emma's nervous enough.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.584
I want her to feel welcome.

13:16.584 --> 13:18.006
So when Sam gets here,

13:18.006 --> 13:20.452
no teenage shenanigans.

13:21.808 --> 13:23.174
Okay, that's her.

13:23.589 --> 13:25.229
Get rid of this for me.

13:26.515 --> 13:27.976
My girlfriend's here.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.000
Hi.

13:33.385 --> 13:35.852
I brought garlic mashed potatoes.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.310
Oh. That's cool.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.065
Never too many spuds, right?

13:41.686 --> 13:42.935
Come on in, Sam.

13:43.668 --> 13:46.275
Uh, so you guys
remember Lux and Math.

13:46.275 --> 13:50.988
And Tasha who ** to homecoming,
and that's... Mr. Daniels.

13:52.145 --> 13:53.520
How surprising.

13:54.727 --> 13:56.410
And yet not.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.560
Wh-what if Ryan had a stroke?

14:03.560 --> 14:04.912
Or won the lottery?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.760
Or got drafted and was
sent to war next week?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.028
- You would want him to tell you.
- Will you stop?

14:10.028 --> 14:11.670
Ryan is not going to war.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.979
Can we just pick up the pace,
please, and get inside?

14:13.979 --> 14:15.270
I need a cocktail.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.083
My buzz wore off waiting for Cate

14:17.083 --> 14:18.522
to change into a large sweater.

14:18.522 --> 14:20.738
You were the one that told
me I had to hide my boobs.

14:20.738 --> 14:21.777
You shouldn't be hiding anything.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.273
You should just tell Ryan.

14:23.273 --> 14:24.869
Tell me what?

14:26.308 --> 14:28.999
Um... um, that I made

14:28.999 --> 14:32.944
a sweet potato and
veggie sausage casserole.

14:32.944 --> 14:34.378
From scratch?

14:34.378 --> 14:35.136
Yeah.

14:36.154 --> 14:37.554
What are you doing here?

14:37.554 --> 14:40.664
Paige. She ran off to Costa Rica

14:40.664 --> 14:43.516
for some surfing,
yoga, vegan thing,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.284
and she bailed on
Thanksgiving with my mom.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.834
So my parents,
they just started arguing

14:46.834 --> 14:49.134
about who's going to get me,
and I just decided,

14:49.134 --> 14:50.211
you know what,
I'm not going to get

14:50.211 --> 14:51.656
caught up in the middle
of their marital issues.

14:51.656 --> 14:53.564
So you thought you'd come
be caught up in ours.

14:53.564 --> 14:55.314
I think it's so sad
when parents split up.

14:55.314 --> 14:57.034
Especially when they have kids.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.654
Don't you think so, Cate?

15:02.115 --> 15:03.584
Look, it's okay that
I'm here, isn't it?

15:03.584 --> 15:05.047
Yes, it's great.

15:05.047 --> 15:07.871
You know, it's going to give
us a chance to talk about...

15:09.228 --> 15:10.343
Whatever.

15:10.930 --> 15:13.150
And who knows, you know,
maybe we can surprise Dr. Rosner

15:13.150 --> 15:14.941
and we can work
everything out today.

15:15.511 --> 15:17.312
Yeah. Maybe.

15:19.158 --> 15:20.544
That's a nice sweatshirt.

15:34.335 --> 15:36.791
So what is Eric/Mr. Daniels
really doing here?

15:36.791 --> 15:39.812
Mr. Daniels is only here
because Math invited him.

15:40.669 --> 15:41.969
Math may have invited him,

15:41.969 --> 15:43.878
but that's not why he's here.

15:43.878 --> 15:45.879
My guess is, you owe him
another date for ditching him

15:45.879 --> 15:47.628
to commit a felony at homecoming.

15:47.628 --> 15:49.172
Will you shut up about that?

15:49.172 --> 15:50.683
Will it get me an "A"?

15:57.989 --> 16:00.504
That's how it works. Are you sure?

16:00.504 --> 16:01.878
Hey, Sam.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.626
How's that extra
credit work coming?

16:03.626 --> 16:04.953
Got any questions?

16:04.953 --> 16:06.442
No. I'm, I'm good.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.569
Lux is helping me.

16:19.325 --> 16:20.807
I wouldn't have
made mashed potatoes

16:20.807 --> 16:22.468
if someone had told
me that Baze's new

16:22.468 --> 16:24.622
girlfriend was bringring
mashed potatoes,

16:24.622 --> 16:26.942
or, you know, that he
had a new girlfriend.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.784
It's not a competition, Abby.

16:28.784 --> 16:29.636
You could have told me

16:29.636 --> 16:31.540
that my ex was seeing
someone else, Cate.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.559
Your ex? Really?

16:33.559 --> 16:36.280
Oh, sorry. I guess
my feelings for Baze

16:36.280 --> 16:37.410
are insignificant.

16:37.410 --> 16:39.060
This is exactly like the last time

16:39.060 --> 16:41.520
you got knocked up--
all about you.

16:47.739 --> 16:49.859
Bet you wish you could
have that drink now.

16:53.418 --> 16:56.072
To baste or not to baste--
that is the question.

16:56.072 --> 16:57.569
So, it's your call.

16:57.569 --> 16:58.504
You're the one wearing

16:58.504 --> 16:59.759
the sexy apron.

17:00.241 --> 17:02.039
Uh, well, I'm not
sure about basting,

17:02.039 --> 17:04.990
but if the oven isn't hot enough,

17:04.990 --> 17:08.584
we can finish roasting
the turkey under the heat

17:08.584 --> 17:10.582
of Cate's sister's glare.

17:14.742 --> 17:18.253
You know, um, I think Abby
is fine with you being here.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.470
She just gets that look sometimes

17:20.470 --> 17:22.708
because she has a glass eye.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.907
Really? Yeah.
But don't mention it.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.540
She's very sensitive.

17:27.972 --> 17:30.136
Everybody loves that
you're here, Emma.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.806
Especially me.

17:35.278 --> 17:36.581
I have to admit,

17:36.764 --> 17:37.900
I kind of love being here, too.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.301
I haven't done Thanksgiving
in a long time,

17:40.301 --> 17:42.930
and being here doing
the family thing

17:42.930 --> 17:44.635
is really good for Sam,

17:44.635 --> 17:46.755
so thank you for twisting my arm.

17:46.755 --> 17:49.638
Exactly. Company
policy can suck it.

17:52.012 --> 17:52.708
All right,

17:52.708 --> 17:54.650
so we gonna baste? Yeah.

17:55.226 --> 17:57.327
Hi, Lux. Hey, think fast.

17:58.169 --> 17:59.560
Dad.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.443
Surprise!

18:03.730 --> 18:05.254
What are you doing here?

18:05.254 --> 18:07.927
Well, you said you wanted
a family Thanksgiving.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.851
Emma, what are you doing here?

18:12.851 --> 18:13.986
Uh, she just--

18:13.986 --> 18:14.860
she just stopped by.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.072
I brought a file.

18:16.072 --> 18:18.166
For work. 'Cause, you know,
we work together.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.896
Oh, oh, yeah.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.696
Uh, so wh-what happened to Aruba?

18:22.696 --> 18:24.417
Oh, we pushed the
flight till tomorrow.

18:24.417 --> 18:27.644
And with everything you
said about this being Lux's

18:27.644 --> 18:29.187
your mother and I thought
we should be here.

18:29.187 --> 18:32.078
Yeah. I'm sorry,
we should have called, honey.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.778
Mom, are you kidding?

18:33.778 --> 18:35.382
I love surprises.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.307
This wouldn't be Thanksgiving

18:36.307 --> 18:39.361
without my mom's famous...
Something from a store.

18:39.361 --> 18:40.849
Stop it.

18:41.173 --> 18:43.810
- Hey, Math, hi.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

18:43.810 --> 18:45.155
Oh, it's so good to see you.

18:45.155 --> 18:46.152
Good seeing you, too.

18:46.152 --> 18:48.122
Math, will you warm this up,
please?

18:48.122 --> 18:49.846
Sure.

18:49.846 --> 18:51.518
Hello.

18:52.846 --> 18:56.592
Hi. Cocktail/appetizer, anyone?

18:56.592 --> 18:58.074
Let me show you where
the drinks are.

18:58.074 --> 19:00.361
We're saving the box
of wine for dinner.

19:00.604 --> 19:02.308
Oh, good. Good.

19:03.626 --> 19:05.158
Welcome. Yeah.

19:09.673 --> 19:10.791
I'm so sorry.

19:10.791 --> 19:12.438
I had no idea that they
were going to show up.

19:12.438 --> 19:13.758
Sam and I should go.

19:13.758 --> 19:16.038
No, no, no. I think
that would look worse.

19:16.038 --> 19:18.214
And besides, I really
want you to be here.

19:18.214 --> 19:20.579
And I really want to keep my job.

19:20.579 --> 19:23.786
Hey, look, I covered,
okay? Now we'll just cover.

19:24.221 --> 19:26.876
You think no one here is going
to mention that we're dating?

19:27.941 --> 19:30.538
Your mom brought mashed potatoes.

19:32.947 --> 19:34.257
Okay, you know what, don't worry.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.939
I am on this.
And by the way,

19:35.939 --> 19:37.822
as far as my dad is concerned,
Emma and I

19:37.822 --> 19:39.298
are not dating.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.316
What the hell are
you doing in here?!

19:47.316 --> 19:50.422
Relax. It's not like I'm
going to find anything

19:50.422 --> 19:52.782
more interesting than
what I already know.

19:56.206 --> 19:57.578
This is cool.

19:58.593 --> 20:00.145
Can I have it?

20:00.602 --> 20:02.984
Why would...? Why would
I give you anything?

20:04.458 --> 20:06.522
You talked to your boyfriend
about upping my grade yet?

20:06.522 --> 20:09.080
No, I've been too busy playing
hostess to a psychopath.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.356
Who, me? Yeah.

20:10.356 --> 20:12.036
I'm not the one stealing cars,

20:12.036 --> 20:14.237
assaulting old dudes and
sleeping with my teacher.

20:14.237 --> 20:16.592
I'm not sleeping with anyone.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.238
That's too bad.

20:19.582 --> 20:21.624
What do you see in an
English teacher anyway?

20:21.624 --> 20:23.540
Thought you would be
into someone more badass.

20:23.540 --> 20:25.196
Like who?

20:27.325 --> 20:29.390
Oh, who, like you?

20:29.940 --> 20:31.052
What's wrong with me?

20:31.052 --> 20:32.229
Don't get me started.
We'll be here

20:32.229 --> 20:34.672
till Christmas...
of next year.

20:35.455 --> 20:37.375
Lux, Sam, great.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.486
Two big problems.

20:38.486 --> 20:39.917
One, there is a lot

20:39.917 --> 20:41.591
of mashed potato action happening.

20:41.591 --> 20:43.492
I need someone to run to the store

20:43.492 --> 20:45.563
and grab some food
that isn't white.

20:46.301 --> 20:48.012
Anything to get me out of here.

20:48.012 --> 20:49.618
But take Sam.

20:49.618 --> 20:51.006
Uh, why?

20:51.006 --> 20:52.556
Emma and I are not supposed
to be dating at work,

20:52.556 --> 20:53.688
so I need to cover with my dad.

20:53.688 --> 20:56.548
I want to say that you invited
Emma and Sam to dinner

20:57.106 --> 20:58.750
because you guys are dating.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.637
What?!

21:01.151 --> 21:02.454
Help a brother out.

21:02.454 --> 21:05.744
Oh, don't worry,
your secret's safe with us.

21:10.823 --> 21:14.610
Um, hey, thank you for helping
me earlier with my dad.

21:14.610 --> 21:17.798
And if he asks,
Emma and I are not dating.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.324
Who's Emma?

21:20.241 --> 21:22.073
Even better.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.502
Um, Dr. Rosner,
it is Cate Cassidy again.

21:31.502 --> 21:32.656
I know it's Thanksgiving,

21:32.656 --> 21:36.091
but Ryan and I, we need to
work things out, like, today.

21:36.091 --> 21:38.685
I kind of got some news and, um...

21:40.192 --> 21:41.219
I'm not really sure what to do.

21:41.219 --> 21:42.832
Can you call me back?

21:43.845 --> 21:45.848
Holidays are meant to
bring people together.

21:45.848 --> 21:48.358
So, let's talk about what's
really keeping you two apart.

21:48.358 --> 21:50.860
The lies, the infidelity,
the lies...

21:50.860 --> 21:51.659
Abby.

21:51.659 --> 21:53.034
Can you stop?

21:53.034 --> 21:56.158
Yeah, we, uh, we
appreciate your concern...

21:56.158 --> 21:57.304
No, we don't.

21:57.304 --> 21:59.617
Cate and I just, you know...
It's going to take some time.

21:59.617 --> 22:01.346
How much time? Three months?

22:01.346 --> 22:02.616
Six months?

22:02.616 --> 22:03.950
Nine months?

22:03.950 --> 22:05.266
Mom needs your help.

22:05.330 --> 22:06.031
Why?

22:06.031 --> 22:08.751
All the wine is
twist-off or in a box.

22:10.724 --> 22:11.782
Fine.

22:14.154 --> 22:15.570
What's going on?

22:17.268 --> 22:18.415
Nothing.

22:27.855 --> 22:30.225
That was a fun trip
to the grocery store.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.486
You can actually talk, you know.

22:35.486 --> 22:36.860
You don't have to just ignore me.

22:36.860 --> 22:39.068
Just because Baze is
making us pretend to date

22:39.068 --> 22:41.215
doesn't mean that we actually are.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.202
Is this because of the blackmail?

22:43.202 --> 22:44.647
Oh, it's not helping.

22:46.935 --> 22:48.938
You know, Lux,
I'm really not a bad guy.

22:50.122 --> 22:50.973
I'd be willing to forget

22:50.973 --> 22:53.212
all about you and
Eric/Mr. Daniels.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.249
For a kiss.

22:57.297 --> 22:58.298
Forget it.

22:58.298 --> 23:00.584
Come on. We're dating, right?

23:01.372 --> 23:02.311
Wha...

23:02.654 --> 23:03.659
Oh, you're afraid you'll like it.

23:03.659 --> 23:04.721
No, I'm not going to kiss you

23:04.721 --> 23:06.840
to cover up something
that's not even true.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.374
That would be a good point.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.302
If I didn't have this.

23:13.963 --> 23:16.324
From one badass to another,
never leave valuable stuff

23:16.324 --> 23:17.648
in a room that
doesn't have a door.

23:17.648 --> 23:18.632
You know, maybe for Christmas,
you should

23:18.632 --> 23:20.128
ask for a shower
curtain with a lock.

23:20.128 --> 23:21.212
Give me that.

23:22.527 --> 23:23.814
In exchange for...?

23:23.814 --> 23:26.086
In exchange for nothing.

23:26.086 --> 23:27.095
Okay, look, we...

23:27.095 --> 23:28.942
We... we took that
at some school thing.

23:28.942 --> 23:30.152
Big deal.

23:30.815 --> 23:32.686
I'm sure your parents would
think it was a big deal.

23:32.686 --> 23:34.656
Or, uh... the school board.

23:35.309 --> 23:36.568
Or the police.

23:40.151 --> 23:41.254
Fine.

23:42.246 --> 23:42.936
Whatever.

23:42.936 --> 23:44.955
But our mouths stay closed.

23:44.955 --> 23:46.049
Sure.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.585
And I hate you.

23:47.585 --> 23:49.898
Whatever you say, cinderella.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.086
Let's just get this over with.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.245
I'm ready when you are.

24:08.283 --> 24:09.317
Not bad.

24:10.035 --> 24:11.502
Not worth the picture.

24:13.832 --> 24:15.042
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

24:15.042 --> 24:17.008
What are you doing
talking to Ryan?

24:17.008 --> 24:18.126
I was just trying to help.

24:18.126 --> 24:19.262
Okay, well, can you stop?

24:19.262 --> 24:20.372
Face it, Cate.

24:20.372 --> 24:21.679
You're the one in the wrong.

24:21.679 --> 24:23.966
It's classic, really, therapy 101.

24:23.966 --> 24:25.703
You constantly deny
the men in your life

24:25.703 --> 24:26.947
the chance to be there for you.

24:26.947 --> 24:28.841
You did it with Baze, and now
you're doing it with Ryan.

24:28.841 --> 24:30.034
Okay. You know what
you constantly do?

24:30.034 --> 24:31.674
You make my life worse
by getting involved

24:31.674 --> 24:33.638
with the men that impregnate me.

24:35.558 --> 24:36.706
How's it going?

24:36.706 --> 24:39.561
Well, apparently, Cate's still
mad that I slept with Baze.

24:40.328 --> 24:42.682
I mean, if she's going
to yell at every woman

24:42.682 --> 24:44.288
who sleeps with Baze,
why not go after,

24:44.288 --> 24:46.988
you know, Ryan's sister
or that Emma chick?

24:46.988 --> 24:47.909
What?

24:47.909 --> 24:50.063
Nate is dating Emma?

24:51.322 --> 24:53.553
Oh. That's why she's here.

24:54.178 --> 24:55.736
Oh, crap.

24:55.736 --> 24:58.158
You were the one I wasn't
supposed to tell about Emma.

25:03.911 --> 25:05.519
What the hell is going on?

25:05.987 --> 25:07.786
Um, what the hell is
going on with what?

25:07.786 --> 25:09.404
With you and Emma.

25:10.188 --> 25:12.236
Are you two seeing each other?

25:12.444 --> 25:13.338
What?

25:13.628 --> 25:14.413
No.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.713
Okay. Yes.

25:18.713 --> 25:20.563
But... okay, but hear me out.

25:20.563 --> 25:22.797
I know that there is a no-dating
policy at your company,

25:22.797 --> 25:24.480
and I am not asking
for special treatment,

25:24.480 --> 25:27.226
but Emma and I have
been dating for a while,

25:27.226 --> 25:29.036
and it hasn't affected our work.

25:29.036 --> 25:31.054
In fact, if anything,
my work has gotten better,

25:31.054 --> 25:32.809
and you even said so yourself.

25:32.809 --> 25:34.425
End it, Nate.

25:34.857 --> 25:36.718
Dad, wait.

25:37.792 --> 25:40.152
Do... do you remember how
hung up I was on Cate

25:40.152 --> 25:41.494
and how I never thought...

25:41.494 --> 25:43.764
Like, I really thought
I'd never get over it?

25:44.613 --> 25:46.989
I did because of Emma.

25:46.989 --> 25:49.870
End it now.

25:54.788 --> 25:56.902
I don't want to.

25:56.902 --> 26:00.510
God, you... you
don't stop to think

26:00.510 --> 26:03.130
before you jump into bed
with anyone, do you?

26:04.352 --> 26:06.581
There's the girl who
burned down your bar,

26:06.581 --> 26:09.246
Cate, her sister,

26:09.246 --> 26:12.233
now your boss, my employee.

26:12.233 --> 26:13.629
I thought you'd changed, Nate.

26:13.629 --> 26:15.031
I thought you were getting
your life together,

26:15.031 --> 26:16.646
making good choices...

26:16.646 --> 26:18.734
grown-up choices,

26:19.083 --> 26:20.242
and you just throw it away.

26:20.242 --> 26:22.410
I'm not throwing anything away.

26:24.400 --> 26:28.645
Emma... she's made
me a better man.

26:28.645 --> 26:30.376
I don't care what she's made you.

26:31.330 --> 26:34.495
You break up with Emma,
or you're fired.

26:52.659 --> 26:54.247
Sam? Sam!

26:54.247 --> 26:55.425
Seriously!

26:56.065 --> 26:57.481
Give it back!

26:57.481 --> 26:59.036
What? Wait. What, for that kiss?

26:59.036 --> 27:00.258
Admit it-- it was weak.

27:00.258 --> 27:01.338
You don't want to
mess with me, okay?

27:01.338 --> 27:03.250
People that do--
they end up in the hospital.

27:05.053 --> 27:06.500
Hey, what's going on?

27:14.329 --> 27:15.621
What's wrong?

27:16.082 --> 27:16.885
Nothing.

27:17.586 --> 27:18.888
Lux, come on.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.368
You've been acting
weird since homecoming.

27:20.368 --> 27:21.676
What's going on?

27:25.893 --> 27:26.969
Sam.

27:28.376 --> 27:30.678
He knows about us.

27:30.678 --> 27:31.347
What?

27:31.347 --> 27:33.089
He suspected at homecoming,
and then he tried

27:33.089 --> 27:34.602
to get me to make
you give him an "A"

27:34.602 --> 27:36.692
on all his makeup work,
so I-I-I called his bluff,

27:36.692 --> 27:37.969
but then, today, he showed up,

27:37.969 --> 27:40.130
and he found that picture
of us from the wedding.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.280
You said that you got rid of that.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.384
I... I was going to.

27:42.384 --> 27:44.196
And so now this kid who's
known since homecoming

27:44.196 --> 27:46.524
has a picture of us and you
weren't going to say anything?

27:46.524 --> 27:47.866
Well, I was going
to try to fix it.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.226
Lux, it's bad enough
that Tasha knows.

27:51.822 --> 27:54.072
Great. I have to...
I have to quit my job.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.469
I have to move to another state.

27:55.469 --> 27:57.586
I could get arrested, Lux.

27:59.330 --> 28:01.284
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

28:01.284 --> 28:03.817
Listen, you shouldn't have
to deal with this, all right?

28:03.817 --> 28:05.656
I should go. I shouldn't have
been here in the first place.

28:05.656 --> 28:06.941
No, no. If you go, it's going

28:06.941 --> 28:08.334
to make us look more guilty and...

28:08.334 --> 28:10.166
And give him more ammunition.

28:10.491 --> 28:13.752
Hey, you guys are missing
the bullwinkle balloon.

28:13.752 --> 28:15.967
And it's dinnertime.

28:29.173 --> 28:32.960
Well, I don't know about anybody else,
but I am starving.

28:32.960 --> 28:36.408
And these potatoes, they...
They all look so delicious.

28:36.408 --> 28:38.580
Oh, uh, that orange is stuffing.

28:38.580 --> 28:39.974
I made it from scratch.

28:39.974 --> 28:42.007
Oh.

28:42.007 --> 28:43.583
Does anyone want meat?

28:43.583 --> 28:45.196
Dad, would you like
to tell everyone

28:45.196 --> 28:47.024
if they want meat or not?

28:48.196 --> 28:50.611
You want to dictate
what kind they can have?

28:50.611 --> 28:53.539
White, dark,

28:53.539 --> 28:55.762
thigh, breast?

28:55.762 --> 28:57.074
Nate?

28:57.812 --> 28:58.948
Nate, honey,

28:58.948 --> 29:00.132
are you okay?

29:00.132 --> 29:01.518
Yeah. Why?

29:02.008 --> 29:04.575
'Cause you're carving that
turkey like it's the shining.

29:06.296 --> 29:07.994
Do we have any bread
to go with the...

29:07.994 --> 29:09.510
Potatoes and marshmallows?

29:09.510 --> 29:10.752
Uh, yeah, 'cause I don't think

29:10.752 --> 29:12.886
there's enough
starch at the table.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.732
Oh, I think Cate has
some buns in the oven.

29:15.732 --> 29:16.754
Abby.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.175
Seriously, if you guys
need more rolls, Lux and I

29:20.175 --> 29:22.783
could do another grocery run--
since we're dating.

29:25.019 --> 29:27.090
Somebody pass the stuffing.

29:27.090 --> 29:27.830
Oh!

29:27.830 --> 29:29.784
The one that's not Cate's.

29:32.963 --> 29:34.260
Unless, of course, you want

29:34.260 --> 29:36.046
to offer an opinion
about this, too.

29:39.477 --> 29:41.175
If you're going to
make bad choices,

29:41.175 --> 29:42.342
I'm going to tell you.

29:42.342 --> 29:44.564
Could someone please
pass those baby peas?

29:44.564 --> 29:46.468
Ryan, you should
help yourself first,

29:46.468 --> 29:48.382
'cause I know how much
you wanted baby...

29:48.382 --> 29:50.222
Mom, stop!

29:51.125 --> 29:52.360
Cate, what's going on with you?

29:52.360 --> 29:53.350
Nothing is going on.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.378
It is our first
Thanksgiving with Lux

29:55.378 --> 29:56.882
and Tasha,
and we are all together,

29:56.882 --> 29:59.277
and I would just really
like to enjoy it.

29:59.277 --> 30:00.962
We're trying, Cate.
Stop freaking out.

30:00.962 --> 30:02.380
Okay, I'm not freaking out.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.832
I just want to have a
really nice Thanksgiving,

30:03.832 --> 30:06.200
and no one has touched the
stuffing that I had made.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.628
Nothing's going the way
that I would like it to.

30:07.628 --> 30:09.726
You are the one that
is freaking me out!

30:09.726 --> 30:10.910
Uh, Cate?

30:27.261 --> 30:28.509
Cate?

30:29.237 --> 30:31.088
I'm pregnant.

30:43.501 --> 30:44.609
I mean, how is it that I can find

30:44.609 --> 30:46.909
the absolute worst
way to do everything?

30:47.668 --> 30:49.942
It wasn't the worst.

30:52.307 --> 30:54.771
I spit on Thanksgiving, Ryan.

30:55.628 --> 30:57.190
It was Lux's first
Thanksgiving with us.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.864
I could have abandoned
her at a soup kitchen,

30:58.864 --> 31:00.803
and it would have been less gross.

31:02.586 --> 31:03.922
Look, um...

31:04.834 --> 31:06.429
- I'm moving back home.
- No.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.765
- Yes.
- No.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.996
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.314
Nothing has changed between us.

31:16.974 --> 31:17.799
You know, having a baby

31:17.799 --> 31:18.727
doesn't change the fact

31:18.727 --> 31:20.736
that our marriage is a
complete mess, that...

31:21.233 --> 31:23.019
You went to Julia,
that I went to Baze.

31:23.019 --> 31:25.033
We are not even living
in the same space.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.627
Having a baby changes everything.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.820
16 years ago, all you wanted

31:29.820 --> 31:31.543
was for someone to
stand in front of you

31:31.543 --> 31:33.283
and be an accountable guy.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.247
Now, that's what I'm doing.

31:35.838 --> 31:38.046
I'm not 16 anymore.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.716
And I don't want you back if
we are going to keep having

31:42.716 --> 31:45.524
the same stupid fights about
the same stupid things.

31:47.945 --> 31:50.994
And I don't want you back
because you want a baby.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.068
I want you back
because you want me.

32:26.072 --> 32:27.621
Your dad knows, doesn't he?

32:30.865 --> 32:32.449
Yeah, he knows.

32:32.449 --> 32:35.722
I guess... I guess Abby told him--

32:35.722 --> 32:37.361
accidentally, supposedly.

32:37.361 --> 32:38.351
He, uh...

32:38.924 --> 32:41.684
He threatened to fire me if
I don't break up with you.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.565
I can't believe him.

32:43.565 --> 32:46.494
Hey, you warned me,
company policy.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.177
I guess that matters more

32:48.177 --> 32:49.601
to my dad than me.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.491
I told you I should have gone.

32:52.466 --> 32:54.629
I'm... I'm going to get Sam.

32:54.629 --> 32:56.055
Emma... no.

32:56.055 --> 32:58.350
Nate... yes.

32:59.235 --> 33:02.604
I know how hard you've worked
to be seen as that guy,

33:02.604 --> 33:06.709
the one who can carve the
turkey and host Thanksgiving

33:06.971 --> 33:10.103
and provide for your daughter
and hold down a real job.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.913
And I know how badly
you want to prove

33:11.913 --> 33:13.824
that you are that guy to your dad.

33:16.523 --> 33:18.645
And if my being here, or...

33:20.089 --> 33:21.083
You being with me

33:21.083 --> 33:23.559
puts that all at risk,
then maybe he's right.

33:24.208 --> 33:25.950
I shouldn't be here, and...

33:26.762 --> 33:28.441
We shouldn't be together.

33:48.624 --> 33:51.413
Is this what normal people
Thanksgiving is like?

33:51.649 --> 33:53.933
Because I'm starting to get
nostalgic for that time

33:53.933 --> 33:56.373
we made an entire dinner
out of canned goods

33:56.373 --> 33:58.469
and used shoe as a football.

34:01.269 --> 34:03.920
I think I have to tell
Cate the truth, Tash.

34:04.940 --> 34:06.547
About me and Eric.

34:07.161 --> 34:08.668
Are you crazy?

34:09.065 --> 34:10.366
No, you don't.

34:10.583 --> 34:12.880
Sam knows. He's been
blackmailing me.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.161
He threatened to call the cops.

34:14.161 --> 34:16.492
What? He found this
picture of me and Eric

34:16.492 --> 34:18.425
when we went and
crashed that wedding.

34:20.114 --> 34:22.145
I know I made a mistake, but...

34:22.440 --> 34:23.820
None of this is Eric's fault.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.728
I don't, I don't want
him to get into trouble.

34:27.155 --> 34:30.089
So... don't tell Cate.

34:32.183 --> 34:35.983
No, Cate being mad I
can handle, but...

34:36.399 --> 34:38.241
If Sam calls the cops?

34:40.100 --> 34:42.705
There's no case if Cate and
Baze don't press charges,

34:42.705 --> 34:44.347
and all I have to do is, is

34:44.347 --> 34:46.384
tell Cate that-that
I wasn't a victim,

34:46.384 --> 34:47.710
that we haven't slept together,

34:47.710 --> 34:49.859
that he didn't even
know how old I was.

34:49.859 --> 34:51.556
What about me?

34:54.110 --> 34:56.783
Well, yeah, you covered for us,
Tash, but...

34:57.154 --> 35:00.619
Come on, this is bigger than
Cate finding out that you lied.

35:00.845 --> 35:02.796
Not to me, Lux.

35:03.991 --> 35:06.669
You keep telling me
everything's going to be okay.

35:06.669 --> 35:10.128
You asked me to protect you,
and I did.

35:10.591 --> 35:13.071
So I'm in this, too, okay?

35:14.281 --> 35:15.798
If secrets start coming out,

35:15.798 --> 35:17.611
Sam knows more than one.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.774
What if-- what if he tells
Cate what I did to Trey?

35:22.956 --> 35:26.187
You might be willing to lose
everything, Lux, but I'm not.

35:48.852 --> 35:49.844
Cate.

35:50.810 --> 35:54.024
You can't eat that whole casserole.
That's just sad.

35:54.511 --> 35:56.643
It's the one good thing
that came out of today,

35:57.473 --> 35:59.035
and no one even gave it a chance.

36:00.163 --> 36:02.393
You told you husband he's
going to be a father,

36:02.393 --> 36:04.299
and he actually wants to be one.

36:04.299 --> 36:05.647
I'd say that's a good thing.

36:05.647 --> 36:07.783
No, he wants to be a good
guy and do the right thing.

36:07.783 --> 36:09.762
There is a big difference.

36:12.097 --> 36:14.297
What do you expect, Cate?

36:14.297 --> 36:16.059
What do you want him to do?

36:16.059 --> 36:17.569
If he walked away,
if he didn't come back,

36:17.569 --> 36:19.657
would that make you feel better?

36:20.174 --> 36:22.083
I want Ryan to come back,
I just...

36:25.730 --> 36:27.608
I'm like a plastic container.

36:29.358 --> 36:31.182
Cheap and disposable?

36:32.962 --> 36:36.032
No. He wants what's inside,
he doesn't want me.

36:40.508 --> 36:42.711
I know this is messy, and it's

36:42.711 --> 36:45.387
not how you wanted to happend.

36:46.181 --> 36:47.289
But let's look on the bright side,

36:47.289 --> 36:48.975
what you wanted is happening.

36:48.975 --> 36:52.285
You wanted Ryan back home,
you said so yourself.

36:55.164 --> 36:57.529
No, we were supposed
to fix things first.

36:58.875 --> 37:02.891
But maybe his coming home
will be what fixes things,

37:03.109 --> 37:04.924
not the other way around.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.860
I mean, do you really think
that that could happen?

37:20.134 --> 37:21.625
Cate. Mm.

37:23.610 --> 37:24.965
This is edible.

37:26.868 --> 37:28.240
That proves it.

37:28.961 --> 37:30.977
Anything can happen.

37:41.189 --> 37:42.985
Emma? Wait.

37:42.985 --> 37:45.583
You're not leaving. He is.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.227
What happened?

37:48.806 --> 37:51.130
What is going on between you two?

37:51.130 --> 37:53.871
I'm just trying to stop your
son from screwing up his life.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.351
The only screwup is believing

37:55.351 --> 37:57.741
things between us had changed.

37:58.012 --> 37:59.611
You're never going to think
that I know better than you,

37:59.611 --> 38:01.857
or that I can make the
right choice, but I can.

38:01.857 --> 38:05.098
If you are making me choose
between you and Emma,

38:05.621 --> 38:07.337
then I choose her.

38:12.626 --> 38:13.889
We're leaving.

38:14.124 --> 38:15.763
Oh, Jack, wait...

38:15.763 --> 38:17.011
Let's go.

38:18.655 --> 38:20.433
You made the wrong choice.

38:25.579 --> 38:26.797
I'll call you.

38:59.775 --> 39:02.696
I have a doctor's
appointment on Monday.

39:02.696 --> 39:05.549
Yeah. I-I can meet you there.

39:06.584 --> 39:07.680
Yeah.

39:09.630 --> 39:11.282
Or we could go together.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.875
From home.

39:21.494 --> 39:22.722
Cate?

39:23.050 --> 39:24.916
Can I talk to you for a sec?

39:24.916 --> 39:26.671
Is everything okay?

39:26.671 --> 39:28.223
Not really.

39:28.223 --> 39:31.507
Cate? The police are here.
They want to talk to you.

39:34.636 --> 39:35.970
We have a warrant.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.244
For who?

39:38.682 --> 39:41.225
Uh, Cate, I can, I can explain.

39:41.849 --> 39:44.041
Natasha Siviac.

39:46.670 --> 39:47.951
For assault.

39:51.401 --> 39:53.811
We're going to take you
down to the station now.

39:54.018 --> 39:55.680
I didn't call, I swear.

39:55.878 --> 39:56.979
Our records show that you

39:56.979 --> 39:59.159
and Ryan Thomas are her
legal guardians? Mm-hmm.

39:59.159 --> 40:01.246
We're going to need
you to come with us.
