<i> They call me lefty.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:32.391
<i> Anyway,</i>
<i> I wasn't suppose to be here.</i>

01:33.828 --> 01:36.361
<i> People will doubt you</i>
<i> until you prove them wrong.</i>

01:38.199 --> 01:40.282
<i> Too many haters out there,</i>

01:40.283 --> 01:42.366
<i> who don't have the balls</i>
<i> to strive for their dreams.</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:43.635
<i> So they shit on yours.</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:50.576
<i> Now it comes down</i>
<i> to 36 minutes</i>
<i> in the ring, Max.</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:53.212
<i> And all those thoughts</i>
<i> stirring through my head</i>

01:53.214 --> 01:56.381
<i> don't mean a damn thing</i>
<i> until that bell rings.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:14.199
This is one
for the ages, folks!

02:14.201 --> 02:15.667
Who would believe
Rodriguez would be

02:15.669 --> 02:17.169
in the 10th round
with Dawson?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.204
I said right!

02:22.276 --> 02:24.610
Yeah! Throw that hook!
Watch it!

02:25.479 --> 02:26.478
Yeah!

02:33.454 --> 02:35.787
<i> A strong finish in the round</i>
<i> for Rodriguez.</i>

02:35.789 --> 02:37.356
Huh! Nothing, huh?

02:37.357 --> 02:38.924
How does it feel
to get your ass kicked
in front of world, huh?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.776
In front
of the world, baby!

02:40.777 --> 02:42.627
<i> Dawson just won't let up</i>
<i> with the taunting.</i>

02:44.565 --> 02:47.566
Hey! Don't let him
get into your head, man.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.734
That's his game.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.537
Tonight is your night.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.274
That fucking belt
belongs to you. All right?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.610
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!

03:00.614 --> 03:02.714
He's from the neighborhood.
He's a Brooklyn boy.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.184
Now you go on there
and you go get him!
Get him!

03:05.186 --> 03:06.552
<i> Round 11, folks,</i>

03:06.553 --> 03:07.919
<i> and it doesn't get</i>
<i> any better than this</i>

03:07.922 --> 03:10.589
<i> here at Caesars Palace,</i>
<i> Atlantic city.</i>

03:13.694 --> 03:15.711
--Each your corner.

03:15.712 --> 03:17.729
<i> Rodriguez is down</i>
<i> for the third time,</i>

03:17.731 --> 03:19.798

<i> this might be it.</i>

03:19.800 --> 03:21.266
-Three...
-Come on, get up!

03:21.268 --> 03:22.334
Four...

Five, six...

03:24.838 --> 03:26.672
-Seven...
-Get up! Come on!

03:26.674 --> 03:27.773
Are you kidding me!

03:27.775 --> 03:28.966
Don't let him
take your heart!

03:28.967 --> 03:30.158
You kidding me?
You want another beating?

03:30.159 --> 03:31.350
<i> He's back on his feet.</i>

03:31.351 --> 03:32.542
<i> Unbelievable heart</i>
<i> from Rodriguez.</i>

Are y'all seeing this?

03:33.480 --> 03:34.479
Let's go!

03:35.883 --> 03:38.483
Now get that air

03:38.485 --> 03:40.719
<i> Dawson's looking to close</i>
<i> this round out strong!</i>

03:43.691 --> 03:45.424
There you go! There you go!

03:48.996 --> 03:50.662
Stop, break. Let's go.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.600
Lay the fuck down,
you dumb Guinea-rican!

03:57.404 --> 03:58.637
Do yourself
a fucking favor, man.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.672
Lay down, motherfucker.

04:02.810 --> 04:03.742
Yeah!

04:08.449 --> 04:09.949
Yeah!

04:09.950 --> 04:11.450
<i> Oh, what an upper cut</i>
<i> from Rodriguez!</i>

04:13.570 --> 04:15.687
<i> Well, folks,</i>
<i> you'll get your money's worth</i>
<i> on this one.</i>

04:15.689 --> 04:17.822
<i> A true</i>
<i> middleweight classic.</i>

04:20.027 --> 04:22.394
Come on, now.
Breathe, breathe.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.263
All right, pretty boy?

04:24.265 --> 04:25.530
Three minutes left.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.333
It's the final
three minutes.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.669
All right?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.671
It's all up to you,
Anthony.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.008
You need a knockout.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.010
It's your time
to make history.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.514
This is your last chance
you'll ever be here again.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.884
Everything you've
been through
in your life

04:45.886 --> 04:49.521
comes down to these
final three minutes.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.658
So you give it everything
you have left in your body

04:52.660 --> 04:55.027
and shut that asshole up!

04:55.029 --> 04:56.928
Yeah.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.031
All right?
You hear me?

05:03.570 --> 05:04.686
You hear me?

05:04.687 --> 05:05.803
Now you get out there.
You're my champ!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.050
- Go ahead.

05:07.051 --> 05:08.295
<i> All right, here we go</i>

05:08.296 --> 05:09.540

<i> Oh, some great body shots</i>
<i> by Rodriguez!</i>

05:37.071 --> 05:39.471
<i> A hard right!</i>
<i> Wow, he's got him!</i>

05:40.808 --> 05:41.907
Show him
who the champ is!

05:42.609 --> 05:43.608
There you go!

05:44.945 --> 05:45.877
Yeah!

05:54.587 --> 05:56.654
<i> Dawson's down</i>
<i> for the first time</i>
<i> in his career!</i>

06:06.500 --> 06:09.718
<i> Oh, my god! He's done it!</i>

06:09.719 --> 06:12.937
<i> Anthony Rodriguez is the</i>

06:37.931 --> 06:39.698
<i> Some words</i>
<i> from Reggie Dawson.</i>

06:40.701 --> 06:42.534
<i> Yo, man,</i>
<i> are you kidding me?</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.002
<i> Are you people everywhere?</i>

06:44.004 --> 06:45.888
<i> Yo, let tell you</i>
<i> something right now.</i>

06:45.889 --> 06:47.773
<i>Anthony Rodriguez</i>
<i>is one lucky mother--</i>

06:47.775 --> 06:49.233
<i> I want to tell him</i>
<i> right now,</i>

06:49.234 --> 06:50.692
<i> matter of fact,</i>
<i> I want to tell all of y'all.</i>

06:50.693 --> 06:52.151
<i> I want a rematch.</i>
<i> That shit ain't gonna</i>
<i> happen again.</i>

06:52.152 --> 06:53.610
<i> Get out of my face,</i>
<i> it's over.</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:08.860
Hello.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.464
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry about it.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.032
<i> If I say</i>
<i> I'm gonna be someplace,</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:15.534
<i> then I'm gonna be there.</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:46.665
Hey, I can't believe it.
That's Anthony Rodriguez.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.133
-I know him.
-You know him?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.501
Yeah, we're good friends.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.635
Hey, Anthony!

07:51.505 --> 07:52.838
What,
you don't remember me?

07:53.540 --> 07:55.057
Come on. Sal?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.575
Sallie from the neighborhood.
I go to all your fights.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.510
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
How you doing?

07:58.512 --> 07:59.945
I'm doing great.
I am doing great, Anthony!

07:59.947 --> 08:01.746
Not as good you, though.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.114
I mean, come on, man,
that's some set of wheels
you got there.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.749
And that fight last night...

08:04.751 --> 08:06.918
Way to go. I'm so glad
you kicked Dawson's ass.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.086
Thank you.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.021
Listen, I gotta meet
somebody inside.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.007
Okay, sure. But, hey,
before you go,

08:12.008 --> 08:13.992
you think maybe give a little
shout out in my cellphone here

08:13.994 --> 08:15.827
for my wife, you know.
She's a big fan too,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.996
and I'll impress her
if I bring it home with me
and all, you know?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.631
-Okay, all right.
-I'll tell you when.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.601
What's your name, again?

08:22.603 --> 08:23.869
Sal! Sallie,
from the neighborhood.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.237
-Come on, you know!
-Yeah, yeah, that's right.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.538
You know.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.074
All right, you're ready
and... go.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.426
<i> Hey, sallie!</i>

08:31.427 --> 08:33.043
<i> This is your boy,</i>
<i> Anthony Rodriguez.</i>

08:33.046 --> 08:34.779
<i> You the man, sal!</i>
<i> You the man!</i>

08:35.916 --> 08:36.847
<i> Good?</i>

08:36.850 --> 08:38.616
Good? That was great!

08:38.619 --> 08:40.251
Thanks a lot, Anthony.
I appreciate it.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.852
Enjoy your lunch, champ,
all right?

08:41.855 --> 08:42.921
Thank you.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.224
I told you we were close.
Like that.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.293
<i> Hey, dino.</i>

08:48.295 --> 08:49.861
Hey, Anthony,
how you doing?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.730
-Good, how are you?
-Congratulations.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.231
-Great fight. Amazing.
-Thank you.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.033
Larry's been waiting
here for you.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.768
-Okay.
-Let me take your coat.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.190
Thank you.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.607
Let me know if you need
anything. All right.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.548
Hey.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.117
Anthony "lefty"
Rodriguez!

09:13.020 --> 09:16.288
Forevermore known
as champ.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.607
How are you, Larry?

09:18.608 --> 09:20.925
Finally got you
in a one-on-one sit-down.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.796
Why did you pick
this place?

09:25.966 --> 09:29.167
The food.
It's really good here.

09:29.169 --> 09:33.738
Most fighters, they want fans
to know who they really are,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.840
where they come from,
what they're made of.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.244
And reporters want
to know that too.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.680
They want to connect
the dots.

09:41.682 --> 09:45.784
But it's almost
like you've been hiding
something all these years.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.187
I really wasn't ready
to talk.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.355
But now since it's over...

09:52.192 --> 09:53.992
I'm ready to tell you
how it all began.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.227
So...

09:56.229 --> 09:59.264
So tell me what it feels
like to be back here.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.870
Don't actually
feel the same.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.172
What do you mean?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.106
Being here.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.809
I haven't been
back since.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.611
Since what?

10:14.314 --> 10:15.380
We'll get to that.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.849
What was it like for you

10:17.851 --> 10:20.151
growing up in this
neighborhood, Anthony?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.830
Whoa,
did you see that?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.176
What else do we got?

10:45.846 --> 10:46.878
The bandolier!

10:48.015 --> 10:49.914
Matt,
what are you doing?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.349
Save some stuff
for the fourth.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.851
Ha! Fuck it!

10:53.687 --> 10:55.086
Come on, Anthony.
Come on.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.324
Oh, wow,
that was great!

11:33.326 --> 11:35.794
Hey! Hey!<i> Va fangul!</i>

11:35.796 --> 11:36.995
All the fuckin' day,

11:36.997 --> 11:38.296
you light up-ah
these-ah fireworks

11:38.298 --> 11:40.131
and put the fire
on the street.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.833
And shut
the fucking music off!

11:44.705 --> 11:46.071
Why you don't go
to the park, huh?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.873
Okay. Relax,
Mr. volpe.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.710
Don't you tell-ah me
to relax, Matthew.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.977
Wait until I tell
your papa.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.346
I would tell yours too,
Anthony,

11:55.348 --> 11:57.348
but I don't talk-ah
to no spic.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.021
Bastard.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.023
I can't believe
that old geezer
said that to you.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.792
It's all right, Matt.
I'm used to it.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.928
It's not okay.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.498
Hey, I got an idea.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.204
The noise bothers
that cranky ass?

12:19.206 --> 12:20.472
Wait till he gets
a blockbuster

12:20.474 --> 12:21.973
through his
living room window.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.075
This is crazy, Matt.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.176
It's not a big deal.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.811
This will just scare
the shit out of him.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.413
You really need
to toughen up, Anthony.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.315
Come on,
give me the lighter.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.249
Light it up.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.751
Oh, my god.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.969
Come on, light it.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.186
He deserves this
for what he said to you.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.970
You son of a bitch!

12:54.241 --> 12:55.974
Damn, that was loud!

12:56.877 --> 12:58.476
What's going on,
Anthony?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.780
Hi, dad.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.899
Hi, Mr. Rodriguez.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.017
What the hell
are you kids doing
on the damn curb?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.418
We... we... we're
looking for something.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.387
Matty dropped some money.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.555
Money?

13:11.391 --> 13:12.824
I don't see anything.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.026
What's going on, Anthony?

13:15.862 --> 13:16.828
Nothing.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.301
Get your ass
back home.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.037
See you later, Matt.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.111
What?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.379
What?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.482
Little shit.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.541
Why... why you always
by the window, waiting
for your mother?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.344
You're such a mamma's boy,
you know that?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.381
You never waited for me
when I was working.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.850
Look at me
when I talk to you!

14:14.888 --> 14:17.488
You're like a kid
looking for his mommy.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.290
"Mommy, mommy."

14:21.962 --> 14:23.628
I didn't even have a mother
at your age.

14:24.598 --> 14:25.930
You need to grow up.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.502
And where the hell is she?
She's always out!

14:32.472 --> 14:34.038
Where do you think
she is, dad?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.573
She's working.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.009
More than anyone
can say for you.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.944
I was laid off,
you little shit!

14:41.915 --> 14:42.981
I'll beat the--

14:44.251 --> 14:45.884
I'll beat your ass.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.952
Oh, come on, dad.
Seriously?

14:47.954 --> 14:50.088
I'll beat your ass

14:50.090 --> 14:52.457
for talking back to me.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.958
What's wrong with you?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.526
This needs to stop, man.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.629
You need to stop.
You... you stop.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.581
Anthony.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.549
Anthony!

15:20.620 --> 15:22.186
What?

15:22.188 --> 15:24.656
You threw firecrackers
into Mr. volpe's living room?

15:24.658 --> 15:26.291
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.926
Did you throw firecrackers
into Mr. volpe's living room?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.260
That's what he told me.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.561
You broke the coffee table,

15:30.563 --> 15:32.363
you broke I don't know
what else in there

15:32.365 --> 15:34.065
and I have
to pay for it

15:34.067 --> 15:36.401
or he's gonna call the police
on you and your stupid friend.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.535
Matt is not stupid.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.570
He was just protecting me.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.976
Mr. volpe
called me a spic.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.645
Oh, Anthony, come on!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.547
You know we've been talking
about this since you were
five-years-old.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.382
People are ignorant.
Walk away from that.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.117
They're gonna look
for a reaction from you.

15:53.119 --> 15:53.651
Don't give it to them.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.157
I love you so much,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.591
but you've really
disappointed me.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.627
Mary...

16:03.997 --> 16:05.229
Where were you?

16:05.231 --> 16:07.165
I was at work.
Where do you think I was?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.132
Don't give me no lip!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.969
And... and stop
babying this kid.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.237
He's not a kid,
he's our son.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.406
Our son?
He ain't nothing like me.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.475
He's gonna be like
one of of these goombahs
around here.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.243
Come on,
don't say that. Ooh.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.279
Don't tell me what to do.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.718
I'm... I'm gonna go
get more beers.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.087
Uh...

16:30.423 --> 16:32.156
See you in the bed
when I come back.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.103
I never thought
i would say this,

16:47.073 --> 16:49.040
but I'm really starting
to hate my own father.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.612
He's in a really bad place
right now.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.514
He needs our help.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.515
He don't want help.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.084
And it's only getting worse.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.490
I will get him
to stop drinking.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.691
This will get better.

17:10.746 --> 17:12.695
The neighborhood
is going to explode.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.032
So let's try to keep
a little peace
in the house, okay?

17:19.606 --> 17:22.073
We will walk where we want.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.292
<i> This is Lauren Freeman.</i>

17:41.293 --> 17:43.393
<i> We're here in bensonhurst,</i>
<i> Brooklyn on 20th Avenue,</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:46.164
<i> a few blocks from</i>
<i> where 18-year-old</i>
<i> African-American</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:48.366
<i> Tyrone Williams,</i>
<i> was shot and killed</i>

17:48.368 --> 17:50.201
<i> as he came into bensonhurst</i>
<i> to look at a car</i>

17:50.203 --> 17:51.936
<i> that he was looking</i>
<i> to buy.</i>

17:51.937 --> 17:53.670
<i> Tyrone and two</i>
<i> of his friends</i>
<i> were approached</i>

17:53.673 --> 17:55.640
<i> by an angry group</i>
<i> of white teenagers</i>

17:55.642 --> 17:57.542
<i> who were upset about</i>

17:57.543 --> 17:59.443
one their girlfriends
dating a black man.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.213
A large group
of African-Americans
are here protesting.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.971
As you can see,

18:03.972 --> 18:05.728
<i> this is not sitting well</i>
<i> with the folks</i>
<i> in this neighborhood.</i>

18:05.729 --> 18:07.485
We will walk where we want!

18:07.487 --> 18:09.353
We will walk
where we want!

18:09.355 --> 18:10.855
We will walk
where we want!

18:13.293 --> 18:16.127
Fuckin' nigger lowlifes!
Get the fuck out
of our neighborhood.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.129
Shove that watermelon
up your honkey ass!

18:18.131 --> 18:19.230
Give me this, Tommy.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.834
You fucking Guinea,
I'll fucking kick your ass!

18:22.836 --> 18:24.268
Get your ass out
of our neighborhood!
You don't belong here!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.703
Fuck you, okay!

18:25.704 --> 18:27.137
Get the fuck out of here!
You motherfuckers!

18:32.212 --> 18:33.812
Fucking niggers!

18:33.813 --> 18:35.413
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking moolies!

18:35.415 --> 18:36.481
You fucking eggplants!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.349
You fucking hamster!

18:43.490 --> 18:45.256
-Can you believe that shit?
-I know, right?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.559
What did you do that for,
Dominick?

18:48.561 --> 18:49.827
That was pretty drastic.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.679
Drastic?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.530
These niggers have no right
to march through here.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.199
How many whites get killed
in their neighborhood

18:55.201 --> 18:57.201
and we never hear
a damn thing about it?

18:57.203 --> 18:58.669
A nigger dies
in a white neighborhood

18:58.671 --> 19:00.171
and these monkeys
start marching.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.572
He's right.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.807
Whether he's right or wrong,
it doesn't matter, Tommy.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.242
This is crazy.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.510
Look at
what's happening here.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.512
I know, Maria.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.814
And the black kid
didn't deserve to die.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.283
The poor kid came around
here to look at a car

19:12.285 --> 19:13.518
and he ended up dead.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
Of course, you,
of all people,
would say that.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.788
What's that supposed
to mean?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.191
Well, this is an Italian
neighborhood, Anthony,

19:20.193 --> 19:21.626
and you're not
fully Italian.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.461
I mean,
everyone knows

19:23.462 --> 19:25.295
you have a drunken,
greasy spic for a father.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.366
Don't use that word,
Dominick.
I don't like that.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.870
Leave him alone, Dominick.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.805
Yeah, come on, Dominick.
We're all friends here.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.508
Yeah, you're right, Maria.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.244
Let's shake, Anthony.
Forget about it.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.417
Fuckin' spic!

19:46.419 --> 19:47.852
What's wrong with you,
Dominick?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.587
What are you gonna do,
Rodriguez, huh?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.922
Shit,
that's some last name.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.729
Fuckin' pussy.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.698
You can be a real jerk
sometimes.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.301
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.402
Yeah, let's go.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.340
Matty, come on!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.478
Anthony!

20:14.480 --> 20:16.747
Anthony, stop!
I wanna talk to you.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.402
Talk to me about what?

20:21.403 --> 20:23.386
About how I let
that piece of garbage
get away with hitting me?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.056
He gets out of hand
sometimes.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.724
He feels like he can do
whatever he wants.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.925
You know why, right?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.660
I know what I've heard.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.929
My dad said
his father is in the mafia.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.965
Well, it's true,
and that's why
he acts that way.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.400
He thinks he's untouchable
because of his dad.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.803
I'm so mad at myself
for letting him
get the best of me

20:38.805 --> 20:40.304
and not hitting him back.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.306
It's okay.
You're better than that.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.309
And it doesn't matter to me
at all that your dad
is puerto rican.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.877
You're a good friend
and I like you.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.781
Well,

20:50.783 --> 20:53.284
I think you know how much
i really like you, Maria.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.021
I wish we could be together.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.923
Oh, Anthony.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.558
Right now, we're so young.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.862
But who knows
what the future brings?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.697
Come on,
let's go get a soda.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.433
Okay.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.712
What the fuck
are you doing?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.382
You're always down here.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.652
I didn't even
give you permission
to use this thing!

21:27.654 --> 21:29.754
You don't even know
how to hit
the damn bag right.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.027
That's how
you fuckin' do it.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.862
Maybe you'll learn one day
when you become a real man,

21:37.864 --> 21:40.364
when you get out from under
your mother's skirt!

21:40.366 --> 21:42.933
I'm really not in the mood
for this right now, dad.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.903
And I really don't understand
what you're so angry about
all the time.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.538
You don't know shit, kid.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.173
You got it all.

21:49.174 --> 21:50.807
A nice roof over your head
and nothing to worry about.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.577
A roof over our heads
and it's because of mom.

21:53.579 --> 21:54.679
Hey!
You show some respect,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.080
or I'll beat your ass
right here!

21:56.082 --> 21:58.549
I don't care if your mother
protects you or not.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.618
Where is that bitch?
She should be home, anyway.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.688
You wanna know something,
dad?

22:03.690 --> 22:06.557
I hate when people act racial
and use words like spic.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.859
But you...

22:09.929 --> 22:12.063
You're a no-good spic
piece of shit.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.064
Why, you--

22:18.738 --> 22:19.704
<i> mi hijo</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:21.839
<i> es malo.</i>

22:23.943 --> 22:25.042
<i> Mi hijo es malo.</i>

22:35.355 --> 22:36.487
<i> "Mi hijo</i>

22:36.489 --> 22:37.521
<i> es malo."</i>

22:39.525 --> 22:41.692
Some of the few Spanish words
i learned

22:41.694 --> 22:42.993
from hearing them so much.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.696
Do you know
what it means?

22:46.599 --> 22:47.932
I can't say that I do.

22:49.902 --> 22:50.968
My no-good son.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.106
That was the first time
i was knocked out.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.475
And by my own father.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.846
<i> He was out of control...</i>

23:02.815 --> 23:04.515
<i> ...but that night,</i>

23:04.517 --> 23:06.117
<i> he took things too far.</i>

23:06.119 --> 23:07.151
What the fuck?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.954
What the fuck did you do?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.759
What the fuck will you do?

23:17.663 --> 23:18.763
What the fuck
were you thinking?

23:21.701 --> 23:22.700
What you thinking?

23:22.701 --> 23:23.700
I never knew
that it was
a different building.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.869
And it's the same
fucking bullshit--

23:26.539 --> 23:28.806
a brave man and he had
a reason to be there.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.674
You know how it is.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.676
-Good night, Mary.
-Good night, Mary.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.912
Heya, Mary.
How was work?

23:35.782 --> 23:36.981
Long as usual.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.450
Good night, Enzo.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.918
<i> Buona notte,</i> sweetie.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.623
Where were you, huh?

23:45.625 --> 23:46.590
Look at this.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.858
Jose, don't do this
right now.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.660
I was at work
where I always am.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.796
What the hell are you doing,
saying hi to these
fuckin' goombahs for?

23:52.165 --> 23:53.865
Enzo.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.566
Why do you say hi to these
goombahs for, huh? Huh?

23:55.568 --> 23:57.902
I walk down this street
because they keep
an eye on me, that's it.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.070
I say hello, I say goodbye.
I know people
in the neighborhood.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.473
Go take care of Anthony.
He got a beat down, bitch.

24:02.475 --> 24:03.774
He got a beat down from--

24:03.776 --> 24:05.476
he got a beat down from me
because of you.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.545
-Stop it! Stop it, stop!
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:10.583 --> 24:12.950
We'll take care of it.
All right, we'll handle this.

24:12.952 --> 24:13.918
No!

24:14.620 --> 24:15.619
Let us handle this.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.024
That's all right,
it's enough!

24:22.795 --> 24:23.794
Fucking punk!

24:27.316 --> 24:28.499
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.868
Come back down here, guys,
come on.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.605
You okay?

24:35.508 --> 24:36.240
Come on.

24:37.543 --> 24:38.843
I'm sorry.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.711
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right, get up.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.081
I'm sorry.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.255
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.060
He can't come back here.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.829
He has to stay
away from here.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.032
You know, there's people
in this neighborhood,
they never forgive.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.001
And they never forget. Ever.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.104
We can get along just fine
without him.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.640
Well...

25:12.845 --> 25:13.911
We're gonna have to.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.781
It'll work out, mom.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.583
I'm gonna get a job
to help out.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.193
That'll be $5,
miss caruso.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.630
Thank you.
Have a great day.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.598
Anthony, you're doing
great work, okay?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.767
There may be
a little surprise for you
at the end of the night.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.269
Remember,
today's payday, right?

25:48.948 --> 25:50.948
Hey, Anthony.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.949
We sold more chicken cutlets
this week than I can remember.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.786
Put the broom down.
Let's celebrate.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.189
-Celebrate?
-Yeah

25:58.190 --> 25:59.623
come over here.
Take your apron off,
all right?

25:59.625 --> 26:00.691
Work is over.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.759
Come on,
let's have a little drink.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.602
No, I'm okay, Mr. v.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.772
Hey, I told you.
Call me Jerry.
Don't insult me.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.674
We'll just have
a little scotch, okay?

26:16.676 --> 26:17.841
To celebrate.

26:17.843 --> 26:18.809
Cheers.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.753
See? It's not that bad.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.121
Actually,
it's pretty strong.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.657
Here's your pay, okay?

26:33.659 --> 26:35.726
I put an extra $50 in there
for the week.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.127
You did good, okay?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.963
You worked hard. Take it.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.598
Thank you.
You didn't have
to do that, Mr. v.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.199
It's okay.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.968
I mean,
i feel for you.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.970
It must suck,
not having your dad around.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.241
It's okay.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.310
Me and my mom are fine.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.082
-I'm gonna get going.
-Hey, no, no, no,

26:59.819 --> 27:01.185
can't you sit and talk
for a little while?

27:02.188 --> 27:03.654
Nah, I really gotta go.

27:05.858 --> 27:06.824
Anthony...

27:08.027 --> 27:09.226
Relax.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.928
Relax, my boy.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.663
Relax.
You're way too tense.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.033
You know, maybe you need
a little massage.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.902
No, I'm okay.
Really, Mr. v.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.004
I don't need a massage.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.943
Anthony, it's okay
if it feels good.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.778
What the hell are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

27:27.780 --> 27:29.647
What's wrong with me, huh?

27:29.649 --> 27:30.648
I like you.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.250
People looked at me
and thought I was crazy

27:33.252 --> 27:35.019
for hiring a puerto rican.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.854
But I did it.
I did it 'cause of you.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.055
You're sick,
you know that?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.790
I'm sick?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.058
Get out of here!
You're fired!

27:41.060 --> 27:42.092
And don't come back!

27:42.094 --> 27:43.160
Like I really would!

28:01.347 --> 28:03.213
Hurry up and eat
and get back to work.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.849
What's the matter?

28:06.919 --> 28:08.819
Nothing.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.854
Just won't be going
back to work no more.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.956
Why not?

28:12.958 --> 28:14.124
I just think I can do
something better

28:14.126 --> 28:15.426
than work
in a butcher shop.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.962
You can do something better
with your life.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.198
You're gonna do
something better.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.267
I don't know what it is,
but it's gonna be huge.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.202
I hope so, mom.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.906
I got a surprise for you.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.274
A surprise?

28:36.849 --> 28:37.881
Close your eyes.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.356
Wow, mom.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.858
You're the best!

28:47.860 --> 28:49.426
These are great.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.128
I'm very proud of you.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.930
I know it hasn't been easy
with your father

28:52.932 --> 28:54.832
the last couple of years
but...

28:56.102 --> 28:57.234
You made everything better.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.237
And you've brightened up
every day.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.274
Well, that's 'cause
you're an angel, mom,

29:04.276 --> 29:05.309
and I love you.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.759
Would you believe
he's still on the telephone?

29:25.030 --> 29:26.530
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Mary.

29:26.532 --> 29:27.831
-Hiya, Mary.
-Hi, Enzo.

29:27.833 --> 29:28.999
Where you going?

29:36.842 --> 29:37.941
Holy shit!

29:42.448 --> 29:45.249
Hey, Mary... oh, no!

29:47.853 --> 29:50.220
Frank!
Get an ambulance!

29:55.928 --> 29:57.161
My Anthony...

29:58.864 --> 30:00.330
My Anthony...

30:00.332 --> 30:02.266
Enzo...
Take care of my boy.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.049
That was the last day
of my childhood.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.518
Sorry to hear that.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.428
Every day...

30:31.429 --> 30:33.462
Every day she would pray
to him before she came in.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.900
You're gonna be all right,
Anthony.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.936
We'll take care of you.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.305
My dad said it.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.840
You can come
and stay with us.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.476
I need some time
alone, Matty.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.012
I just want to sit here
by myself for a while, okay?

30:50.149 --> 30:51.081
Sure.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.482
I understand.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.518
I'll come back later.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.041
Hey, Mr. v!

31:18.544 --> 31:19.543
Hey, Anthony.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.378
How 'bout a massage?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.615
Anthony! Anthony!

31:26.252 --> 31:27.317
Anthony--

31:28.087 --> 31:29.920
relax!

31:29.922 --> 31:31.488
Shit!
That's Mary donato's kid.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.456
Pull over!

31:35.261 --> 31:37.194
Anthony, relax!

31:37.196 --> 31:38.328
Relax! Anthony!

31:38.330 --> 31:39.329
Hey, break it up!

31:39.331 --> 31:40.397
Anthony!

31:44.469 --> 31:45.969
Straight flush.
You got something bad,
you know what I mean?

31:45.971 --> 31:47.104
No. Straight flush.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.139
Yo, t.A.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.407
Hey, vinny,
how you doin'?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.513
Where'd you get that suit?

31:56.515 --> 31:57.681
Hey, bg, where else?

31:58.951 --> 32:00.951
How bad was this beating?

32:00.953 --> 32:02.619
I mean, how far
did it really go?

32:02.621 --> 32:03.921
How bad was it?

32:04.456 --> 32:06.189
Pretty bad.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.261
This kid
packs quite a punch.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.195
He seemed real determined
to kick the shit out of Jerry.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.998
We got a little
Mike Tyson over here.

32:18.203 --> 32:21.571
Well, before you
explain yourself,

32:21.573 --> 32:23.640
'cause you are going
to do that,

32:23.642 --> 32:25.642
want a soda pop
or something like that?

32:26.578 --> 32:28.245
-Soda pop?
-Yeah.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.147
I just buried my mother.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.615
I think I could use
something a little stronger.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.123
How old are you now?

32:41.660 --> 32:43.260
-Sixteen.
-Sixteen.

32:51.503 --> 32:52.569
Have at it.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.643
Why did you give Jerry
a beating?

33:01.213 --> 33:02.279
I don't want to talk
about it.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.580
Well...

33:04.249 --> 33:05.248
I got news for you.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.050
This is my neighborhood,
see?

33:07.052 --> 33:12.155
And I need to know
everything that goes on
in my neighborhood.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.525
So you need
to talk about it.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.594
Well, then I guess
you need to know

33:17.596 --> 33:20.564
that the neighborhood butcher
is a fuckin' faggot,

33:20.566 --> 33:21.765
who tried to have
his way with me.

33:23.635 --> 33:24.735
Did I hear you clearly?

33:25.571 --> 33:26.737
Jerry's a faggot?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.411
Makes me feel
kind of nauseous.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.717
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

33:40.719 --> 33:44.087
All I did when my father
was drunk off his ass,

33:45.290 --> 33:48.058
was pound that heavy bag.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.560
And I really love boxing.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.063
Do you ever
think about

33:53.065 --> 33:55.432
taking that built up anger
and that boxing talent

33:55.434 --> 33:57.267
and getting paid for it?

33:58.237 --> 33:59.302
All the time.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.572
You ever hear
of Eddie "rocks" travor?

34:02.574 --> 34:04.274
Of course.

34:04.276 --> 34:05.642
He was a great
heavyweight in his day.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.545
So, let's say I hook you up
with Eddie.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.679
Eddie rocks.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.282
You... really,
you don't have to do that.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.083
I don't have to
do nothing.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.620
But it's already done.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.723
Thank you.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.659
So that's how it started
with boxing, Larry.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.360
I met Eddie "rocks" travor

34:24.362 --> 34:26.663
and to this day,
he's still my trainer.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.300
That Enzo,
he saw something in you.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.436
I guess he did.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.237
This was one serious guy.

34:37.775 --> 34:38.775
Hey, Jerry.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.578
We heard
you like little boys.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.692
<i> You said you were</i>
<i> from the neighborhood,</i>
<i> right, Larry?</i>

34:55.694 --> 34:57.194
<i> So then</i>
<i> you must know this...</i>

34:57.196 --> 34:58.495
<i> The mob,</i>

34:58.497 --> 35:00.430
<i> it can be a cancer</i>
<i> to some people,</i>

35:01.400 --> 35:03.166
but it was also built
for a purpose.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.334
To protect the neighborhood.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.436
<i> If you did wrong,</i>

35:06.438 --> 35:07.804
<i> especially back then,</i>

35:08.774 --> 35:11.108
<i> there were</i>
<i> serious consequences.</i>

35:12.478 --> 35:13.443
Hey!

35:17.549 --> 35:19.116
You fuckin' sand nigger!

35:27.626 --> 35:28.825
<i> Death...</i>

35:28.827 --> 35:31.428
Pretty serious consequences.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.230
Look at who
we're talking about
here, Larry.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.133
A fuckin' pedophile,

35:36.135 --> 35:38.568
who apparently
molested other kids.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.570
And a lowlife
gypsy cab driver,

35:40.572 --> 35:42.873
who speeds through
the neighborhood,

35:42.875 --> 35:46.743
kills an innocent woman
and then drives away.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.679
Are you okay
with these thugs

35:49.681 --> 35:54.284
being the judge, jury
and executioners?

35:55.587 --> 35:58.755
That's one question
I'm not gonna answer.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.491
Yo, Larry.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.693
Remember Hector Gomez?

36:04.630 --> 36:05.896
<i> Who could forget him?</i>

36:11.870 --> 36:13.570
<i> Bad blood</i>
<i> between these two</i>

36:13.572 --> 36:15.539
<i> and we got a rowdy crowd</i>
<i> here tonight, folks.</i>

36:20.679 --> 36:21.812
Come on, baby!

36:21.813 --> 36:22.946
<i> Gomez popping the jab,</i>
<i> showboating.</i>

36:24.683 --> 36:26.266
Come on, Anthony! Yeah.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.850
<i> Look at him</i>
<i> taunting Rodriguez.</i>

36:35.076 --> 36:36.659
<i> And a shove</i>
<i> at the end of the round.</i>

36:36.662 --> 36:38.261
Go back to your corner.
Come on.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.701
What the fuck, Anthony?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.469
Hey, I know
this Colombian moves

36:46.471 --> 36:48.605
like he's on an eight ball
of cocaine,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.240
but that don't matter.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.943
You let him float
as much as he wants,

36:52.945 --> 36:56.413
then you get him
on the inside
and pound that body.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.415
Send that prick
back to Colombia.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.385
Okay! Get him!

37:02.387 --> 37:03.453
I love this guy! Yeah!

37:05.891 --> 37:08.925
<i> Rodriguez comes out</i>
<i>like a ball of fire</i>
<i>to start the round.</i>

37:09.828 --> 37:10.760
Come on!

37:11.830 --> 37:13.797
<i> Fierce trading</i>
<i> in the corner.</i>

37:13.799 --> 37:16.466
<i> Whoa!</i>
<i> The crowd loves it!</i>

37:16.468 --> 37:17.767
You got him! Come on!

37:17.769 --> 37:19.603
<i> Rodriguez pummeling him!</i>

37:19.605 --> 37:20.804
-Mother...
-Boom, boom, boom!

37:21.840 --> 37:23.640
<i> And down goes Gomez!</i>

37:25.477 --> 37:28.311
Three, four, five...

37:28.847 --> 37:30.714
Six, seven...

37:31.283 --> 37:33.883
Eight, nine, ten.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.385
Out.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.290
Rodriguez, you suck.
You suck, Rodriguez!

37:40.292 --> 37:41.825
Excuse me.
What'd you just say?

37:41.827 --> 37:44.327
He just got lucky, bro.
You heard me. He sucks!

37:44.329 --> 37:45.295
You suck!

37:45.297 --> 37:46.630
That's my best friend, man!

37:46.632 --> 37:48.331
Who you talking about?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.433
Yeah, man, he sucks!
Fuckin--

37:50.435 --> 37:52.736
you're a bum! Yeah,
he's gonna be the champion!
You'll see!

38:12.591 --> 38:14.791
I knew that Hector Gomez
had nothing on you.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.826
I went wild
when you knocked him out.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.062
I almost had my own brawl
in the stands.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.464
Not everyone
is gonna like me, Matty.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.667
You gotta understand that.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.036
I'm glad we finally
got a chance
to check this place out.

38:26.038 --> 38:27.771
I know, there's some show
tonight too.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.415
Gino fratelli
is up at the balcony.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.385
That's Enzo's boss, right?

38:42.387 --> 38:45.322
From what I hear,
he's everyone's boss.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.058
Look at this.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.432
Gino wants to talk to you.

38:58.904 --> 38:59.869
Okay.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.439
I said you.

39:03.408 --> 39:04.474
Not yous.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.576
No problem.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.912
Come on, let's go.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.886
I must have called him,
i don't know, like,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.723
15, 20 times, I mean.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.091
And he doesn't answer
the phone.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.361
And you ought to make it
clear to him,

39:24.363 --> 39:25.895
-that's not good enough.
-I'll take care of it.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.564
I don't have time for them.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.732
It's like you gotta use
your head.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.467
I know.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.801
You gotta think
about the big picture.
Where you're gonna--

39:32.704 --> 39:33.703
here.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.472
Anthony, sit down.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.511
You know who I am, right?

39:41.513 --> 39:43.747
Of course, Mr. fratelli.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.682
I remember,
back when I was a kid,

39:45.684 --> 39:48.451
my mom told me
a very powerful man
owns this place.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.521
And now
I'm sitting here with you.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.656
First of all,
call me gino.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.727
I saw your fight last night.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.462
That's some left hand
you got.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.464
That Colombian guy,
he never knew what hit him.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.032
Thanks.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.002
I'm left-handed myself.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.171
Back when I was fighting
guys in the streets,

40:08.173 --> 40:10.006
they were always
guarding for the right hand

40:10.008 --> 40:12.475
and I'd slip in
that left hook.
Crack to the eye.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.677
I wasn't so bad
with my hands
when I was your age.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.912
Maybe you should of been
a fighter.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.580
No, no.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.549
There's not nearly
enough money in it.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.418
I know they probably
didn't pay you
very much money

40:21.420 --> 40:22.685
for last night's fight.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.587
A guy like you,
struggling to come up,

40:24.589 --> 40:25.722
they pay you nothing,

40:25.724 --> 40:27.590
and this low-life
Reggie Dawson,

40:27.592 --> 40:29.993
they pay him what,
like $30 million a fight?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.060
Yeah, well,
he's the champ.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.862
He's a piece of garbage.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.064
It's his arrogant
fuckin' attitude
i don't like.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.201
I can't wait
for somebody to knock him
on his fucking ass.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.636
You and me, both.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.770
Yeah.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.772
Enzo really loves you,
Anthony.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.840
He thinks the world
about you.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.642
He talks about you
all the time.

40:45.644 --> 40:46.910
He's been real good to me.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.145
Good.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.948
I'm gonna make sure
it stays that way.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.616
Not a lot of people
from this neighborhood

40:53.618 --> 40:56.619
go on to achieve
great things.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.921
No matter what it is
you're doing,

40:57.923 --> 40:59.689
it's hard to climb
your way to the top.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.624
I think you know
where I'm coming from.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.861
I do.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.696
You keep believing
in yourself, Anthony,

41:07.466 --> 41:09.065
because we believe in you.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.133
Thanks, gino.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.535
You go enjoy yourself.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.671
We'll talk soon.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.738
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

41:22.948 --> 41:23.980
Here you go, buddy.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.048
Thanks a lot, Anthony.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.483
Sure.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.225
-Hey, Anthony!
-Hi, Maria.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.127
I heard you won
your fight.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.796
Yeah, I did.

41:39.798 --> 41:43.733
You know, you never come
to any of my fights.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.268
I guess someone
don't want you there.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.638
You know
i would love to come.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.273
It's just not so easy
sometimes, all right?

41:50.275 --> 41:53.243
Dominick's got his
jealous moments.

41:53.245 --> 41:54.744
Yeah, well,
that's what you chose.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.748
So...

41:58.750 --> 42:00.550
-What can I get you?
-Look.

42:04.656 --> 42:05.956
I'm not here
for the pizza.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.257
I wanted to congratulate you
on winning.

42:07.259 --> 42:09.959
I mean, I know how long
you've been working
on this boxing thing

42:09.961 --> 42:11.828
and I really want it
to pay off for you.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.062
Start making
some real money.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.864
Real money?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.666
I guess that's
what it's all about
for you, Maria.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.636
That's not true
and you know that.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.638
Then why you wearing
a huge rock like that?

42:24.109 --> 42:26.109
I guess all that
loan sharking
and bookmaking

42:27.078 --> 42:28.645
can really come in
pretty handy.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.681
I can't believe
you would talk
like that.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.016
I can't believe
you would go this route.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.820
You know,
i just lost my appetite.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.230
Hey,
what's the matter?

42:47.866 --> 42:49.032
Nothing.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.767
Don't tell me "nothing."

42:50.769 --> 42:52.802
I saw who just walked
out of here.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.270
I don't believe
after all these years,

42:54.272 --> 42:55.572
she still could get to you.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.207
You know
she's with Dominick now.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.009
You know what
Dominick's capable of.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.778
He's a made guy.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.112
I really don't care
what he is.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.349
Let's talk
about something else.

43:06.351 --> 43:07.817
All right.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.586
Let's talk about
how I just plowed
Mrs. Schwartz

43:09.588 --> 43:11.020
on my last delivery.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.597
It was a really good day
today, Matty.

43:20.599 --> 43:21.965
The place is really
starting to come together.

43:29.708 --> 43:31.708
What the fuck
are you doing?

43:31.710 --> 43:33.843
I thought I'd be doing
something better than making
fuckin' pizza boxes.

43:33.845 --> 43:35.778
What are you
talking about?

43:35.780 --> 43:37.780
The pizzeria is doing good.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.749
Didn't it pay
for the sweet chevelle
that you're drivin'?

43:39.751 --> 43:40.984
Yeah.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.919
But I thought I'd be doing
something better.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.887
This ain't enough action
for me, man.

43:44.889 --> 43:45.922
You know what I want to do.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.190
Then take the test again.

43:47.192 --> 43:48.891
I failed it three times,
Anthony.

43:48.893 --> 43:50.259
Three fucking times!

43:50.261 --> 43:52.328
I can't seem to get
this series seven.

43:53.064 --> 43:54.197
You know why?

43:54.199 --> 43:55.965
Because I'm not disciplined
like you.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.200
You wake up every morning,

43:57.202 --> 43:59.002
you exercise, you eat right.

43:59.004 --> 44:02.271
Me, I can't even stay
focused enough
to fucking study right.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.240
Well, that's on you.

44:04.241 --> 44:06.208
If you want to be
a stockbroker,
then do it.

44:06.211 --> 44:08.778
Stop chasin' all these girls
and pass the test, bro.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.380
You want me
to stop chasing girls?

44:10.382 --> 44:12.849
Yo, Annie can't go to ac
with me this weekend.

44:12.851 --> 44:14.017
Why don't
you come instead?

44:14.019 --> 44:16.252
No, Matty. No way.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.855
I'm not going with you
to Atlantic city tonight.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.923
No, don't give me
that look, Matty.

44:20.925 --> 44:22.191
I'm not going.

44:33.872 --> 44:34.904
All right.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.762
What a break.

44:59.764 --> 45:01.130
I can't believe it.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.865
That's six hands
in a row I lost.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.233
Maybe you should call it
a night.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.169
You're down about four gs.

45:06.171 --> 45:07.870
That's a lot of
pizza to make.

45:10.775 --> 45:11.841
You know what?

45:15.914 --> 45:17.346
I'm all in.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.015
All in, baby. Come on.

45:22.087 --> 45:23.019
Nice.

45:26.124 --> 45:27.323
Queens, baby, I love it.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.025
Twenty.

45:31.963 --> 45:32.929
I'm good.

45:32.930 --> 45:33.896
Nice! Come on, baby, bust!
Bust! Come on!

45:33.898 --> 45:34.964
Come on!

45:37.368 --> 45:38.334
Twenty-one.

45:40.438 --> 45:42.338
You suck! You know that?

45:42.340 --> 45:44.073
You can't give me
a frickin' hand?

45:44.075 --> 45:45.274
I'm sorry, sir.

45:45.276 --> 45:46.776
It's not his fault.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.978
Come on,
let's go home.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.179
No way, Anthony.

45:50.181 --> 45:52.081
My host comp'ed a suite.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.016
Let's go to the pool party.
I heard it's pumping.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.253
Come on, let's go.

46:56.815 --> 46:58.314
You know what?
Take a walk
to the bar with me.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.549
You, too. Come on.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.560
That waitress wants you.

47:10.562 --> 47:11.527
Yeah, right.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.598
You're so hooked
on Maria,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.233
who you're not even with.

47:17.235 --> 47:18.434
I need some pussy, man.

47:18.436 --> 47:19.869
I'll even bang
a hooker tonight.

47:20.271 --> 47:21.971
Yo.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.439
I noticed you
from my table.

47:25.109 --> 47:26.609
You're that fighter
they call lefty, right?

47:26.611 --> 47:28.211
Anthony Rodriguez?

47:28.213 --> 47:30.279
Yeah, that's me.

47:30.281 --> 47:31.347
Well, don't be getting
a big head

47:31.349 --> 47:33.082
'cause I recognized you.

47:33.084 --> 47:35.284
The only reason I did
is because

47:35.286 --> 47:38.454
my cousin, vito, is a boxer
and he's fighting you
next month.

47:38.456 --> 47:40.022
Vito germano
is your cousin?

47:40.024 --> 47:42.391
Yeah, that's right.
I'm Nicky germano.

47:43.127 --> 47:44.293
Vito's a good fighter.

47:45.163 --> 47:46.329
It should be a good match.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.365
Good match?

47:49.367 --> 47:51.467
He will knock you
the fuck out
in the first round.

47:53.872 --> 47:56.205
I'm glad you think so,
Nicky germano.

47:57.242 --> 47:58.408
Come on, Matt, let's go.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.575
Who the fuck
do you guys think you are,

47:59.577 --> 48:02.311
coming over here
and your Jersey shore crew?

48:02.313 --> 48:04.881
My boy over here
is gonna kick the shit
out of your cousin.

48:04.883 --> 48:07.650
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking wannabe Joe pesci.

48:07.652 --> 48:09.118
I'll fuckin' bitch-slap you.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.187
You ain't gonna do shit.

48:11.189 --> 48:14.257
Now you and your friends
go back where you came from.

48:14.259 --> 48:16.325
We're not looking
for any trouble, all right?

48:16.327 --> 48:17.293
Come on.

48:18.196 --> 48:19.562
Well,

48:19.564 --> 48:21.030
I don't know
if you know this or not,

48:21.032 --> 48:23.399
but I do a little boxing
myself.

48:25.270 --> 48:27.536
Yeah, golden gloves and all.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.307
Good for you.

48:32.644 --> 48:33.643
Good for me.

48:39.217 --> 48:40.983
Let's go, guys!
You're out of here.

48:40.985 --> 48:42.518
Come on, man!
Get him out of here, too.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.586
Get the fuck off of me!

48:43.588 --> 48:45.121
I'm gonna fucking sue
this place!

48:45.123 --> 48:46.255
Get the fuck off me.

48:59.137 --> 49:00.169
Hey, look at this.

49:01.339 --> 49:03.072
What a bunch of shit?

49:03.074 --> 49:05.241
He beat the shit
out of some guy
in Atlantic city.

49:07.145 --> 49:10.546
He beat up the cousin
of the guy he's gonna fight
in a couple of weeks.

49:10.548 --> 49:11.647
That's funny.

49:13.318 --> 49:15.484
He beat him up
'cause he's gonna lose
to his cousin.

49:19.090 --> 49:20.056
You think so?

49:21.492 --> 49:23.559
He's been training hard
lately,

49:23.561 --> 49:25.261
he's been fighting good.

49:25.263 --> 49:26.395
And you say things
like that.

49:27.398 --> 49:29.298
I'm joking around,
Enzo, okay?

49:29.300 --> 49:31.067
Keep your comments
to yourself.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.269
That's fucked up
that he had to spend
a night in the joint.

49:33.271 --> 49:35.071
He's probably scared
shitless in there.

49:37.041 --> 49:38.507
Here she is.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.576
Thank god.
Saved by the shots.

49:40.578 --> 49:42.712
Yeah, thanks, sweetheart.
Thank you so much.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.714
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.452
All right.
To, uh, our health.

49:50.421 --> 49:51.354
The good life.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.090
Mmm.

49:56.995 --> 49:58.427
You havin' fun?

49:58.429 --> 50:00.096
Yeah. Yeah, of course, I am.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.465
I gotta go
to the ladies room, though.

50:02.467 --> 50:03.566
Take a walk with me?

50:09.173 --> 50:10.773
- Everything's good?
- -Ah!

50:10.775 --> 50:13.175
-Hey, what do we got here?
-Hello.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.443
Go, go, go.

50:14.445 --> 50:16.045
-All right, guys--
-can we get you a drink?

50:16.047 --> 50:18.014
No. Thanks.
I'm just trying to go
to the bathroom.

50:18.016 --> 50:19.081
Me, too.

50:19.083 --> 50:20.316
I wanna buy you a drink.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.584
-You got your hands full.
-Aye.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.087
You know what? I'm...

50:25.089 --> 50:26.355
I'm with someone here,
all right? So just--

50:26.357 --> 50:27.490
I don't see anybody.

50:27.492 --> 50:28.591
Look at this shit.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.092
For two more drinks?
Three?

50:30.094 --> 50:31.694
How about you just fuck off
and get out of my way?

50:31.696 --> 50:33.062
I could fuck off
but I don't want to.

50:34.432 --> 50:36.599
Seriously, you don't want
to mess with my--

50:38.503 --> 50:39.802
what the fuck
you think you doing,

50:39.804 --> 50:41.370
stepping in front
of my girl?

50:41.372 --> 50:43.105
I'm sorry.
We didn't realize
she was with you.

50:43.107 --> 50:44.774
They said
that they were sorry,
all right? Just let it go.

50:44.776 --> 50:46.575
Come on, Dominick.
You know I can't have
any trouble here.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.211
There's no trouble, Danny.
We're good, okay? We're good.

50:49.213 --> 50:50.479
Go ahead. Go do
what you were gonna do.

50:50.481 --> 50:51.514
Doin' good, all right?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.285
Hey, can my friends and i
buy you guys a drink?

50:56.287 --> 50:57.319
Buy you a drink.

50:57.321 --> 50:58.687
We didn't mean
any harm, bro.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.056
I ain't your bro.

51:01.492 --> 51:03.392
Now get the fuck
out of here!

51:03.394 --> 51:04.693
-Go ahead. Now.
-Good idea.

51:04.695 --> 51:05.694
Guys, let's go.

51:05.696 --> 51:06.829
Okay.

51:06.831 --> 51:09.331
Too bad.
She really had a nice ass.

51:09.333 --> 51:11.600
These guidos...
They're always
lookin' for a fight.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.604
Did I, um...

51:18.209 --> 51:19.842
Did I just hear
what I thought I heard?

51:20.244 --> 51:21.177
Yup.

51:23.448 --> 51:24.747
Meet me outside.

51:24.749 --> 51:26.382
-All right.
-You got it, dom.

51:37.161 --> 51:38.372
Hey.

51:38.373 --> 51:39.584
Where did Tommy
and Victor go?

51:39.585 --> 51:40.796
Ah, they left.
They had something
they had to do.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.431
-Don't do anything to them.
-Are you crazy?

51:42.433 --> 51:43.499
-You see those guys?
-Let it go.

51:43.501 --> 51:44.867
Come on.
It was a joke, those guys.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.336
Seriously, it's okay.

51:47.338 --> 51:50.306
Look, I gotta go.
I got something I gotta go do.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.208
Here, why don't you stay here
with your girlfriend.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.882
What happened?
Where are the guys?

51:59.884 --> 52:00.816
I don't know.

52:01.752 --> 52:03.185
You know dom.

52:03.187 --> 52:04.887
He's a fucking crazy,
got a temper. Let's go.

52:07.558 --> 52:09.258
Oh, and that ass, right?

52:09.260 --> 52:10.459
Do you believe that ass?

52:10.461 --> 52:13.329
Oh, so good!

52:13.331 --> 52:15.397
Oh, I'm not your bro,
I'm not your bro!

52:16.300 --> 52:17.500
Enough with that guy.

52:17.502 --> 52:19.368
Let's go hit the other bars.
I'm driving.

52:19.370 --> 52:21.237
Oh, shit! Look!

52:21.239 --> 52:22.805
Oh, no!

52:22.807 --> 52:24.123
Come on. I told you
we didn't want any problem
with you guys.

52:24.124 --> 52:25.440
What makes you think
we got a problem, huh?

52:36.187 --> 52:37.620
Come on,
let's get out of here, Rocco.

52:43.594 --> 52:44.627
What were you thinking?

52:46.531 --> 52:48.181
Can you tell me?

52:48.182 --> 52:49.832
You just wanted to go
spend a couple of days
in jail,

52:49.834 --> 52:51.667
is that it?

52:51.669 --> 52:55.404
As you well know,
I've been there
and it's not a nice place,

52:55.406 --> 52:57.273
especially for someone
like you.

52:57.275 --> 52:59.475
You go and beat the shit
out of somebody
and they lock you up.

52:59.477 --> 53:00.743
It's in the fucking papers.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.279
What the fuck
were you thinking?

53:03.281 --> 53:04.313
I know, Enzo.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.650
I'm sorry, man, I...
I lost my head.

53:08.186 --> 53:09.251
You know what...

53:09.253 --> 53:11.320
This is a very important
time for you,

53:11.322 --> 53:13.422
and it's a time
for you to focus.

53:13.424 --> 53:16.659
You shouldn't have been
in Atlantic city,
in the first place!

53:16.661 --> 53:18.527
I know.
You're right.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.362
This guy's gonna
eat you alive.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.631
You got the rest of your life
to do that kind of thing.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.368
You know, you've been
doing this for a long time,

53:26.370 --> 53:28.404
but your window is closing.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.606
You only have a limited
amount of time left

53:30.608 --> 53:32.408
before you can reach
your full potential.

53:32.410 --> 53:34.810
And you gotta get involved.
You gotta want to get there.

53:34.812 --> 53:37.246
You know you're not there
'cause your head ain't right.

53:37.248 --> 53:38.514
Stay away from Matty.

53:38.516 --> 53:39.982
He's... he's bad news.

53:39.984 --> 53:42.651
He's trouble for you,
goddamn it!

53:42.653 --> 53:44.320
I'll stay out
of trouble, Enzo.

53:45.356 --> 53:47.890
But I can't stay away
from Matty.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.292
His family raised me
after my mother died.

53:50.928 --> 53:52.261
He's like my brother.

53:52.663 --> 53:54.430
Live in the gym.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.733
You got Eddie.
He's the best trainer
you can have.

53:58.903 --> 54:00.469
Don't let everybody down.

54:00.471 --> 54:02.371
Don't let yourself down.

54:02.373 --> 54:03.772
I gotta fucking meet gino.

54:03.774 --> 54:05.541
He's gonna go fucking nuts
if I'm late, all right?

54:05.977 --> 54:07.009
You walk me out?

54:07.011 --> 54:07.977
Absolutely.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.717
Yo, Vic, let's go!

54:14.719 --> 54:15.818
-Ready, Enzo?
-Yeah.

54:17.822 --> 54:18.821
-Ciao, Enzo.
-Enzo.

54:19.390 --> 54:20.356
Whoa, Anthony!

54:21.525 --> 54:22.891
Where you going?

54:22.893 --> 54:24.893
Stick around.
Have a drink.

54:25.663 --> 54:27.429
No drinks for me.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.299
You're fightin'
that Italian kid from Jersey
soon, right?

54:30.301 --> 54:31.800
-Yeah.
-Yeah, and you...

54:31.802 --> 54:33.636
You're fucked.

54:33.638 --> 54:36.739
I mean, he's probably
pretty pissed off
you beat up his cousin.

54:36.741 --> 54:38.941
What the fuck
was that about anyway, huh?

54:38.943 --> 54:40.342
What are you...

54:40.344 --> 54:41.844
What are you,
fuckin' stupid?

54:44.582 --> 54:46.315
Oh, what's the matter?

54:46.316 --> 54:48.049
You gonna tell Enzo now
what I said?

54:48.052 --> 54:49.685
I don't need
to tell Enzo anything.

54:51.656 --> 54:52.955
How's your friend
Matty doing?

54:54.325 --> 54:55.057
Huh?

54:56.861 --> 54:59.995
You know, his pizza sucks.

55:02.500 --> 55:03.565
Take care, guys.

55:07.672 --> 55:09.805
Why you gotta break
his balls like that?

55:09.807 --> 55:12.541
And you know the pizza
is awesome in there.

55:12.543 --> 55:15.577
Come on. We've known him
and Matty all our lives.

55:17.348 --> 55:21.450
He's never been nothing more
than a spic to me, Tommy.

55:21.719 --> 55:22.751
Okay?

55:22.753 --> 55:23.752
Finish your drink.

55:31.896 --> 55:33.462
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

55:41.539 --> 55:42.471
All right.

55:43.941 --> 55:45.507
Yeah,
you got it, baby.

55:50.815 --> 55:51.814
Yeah.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.083
I love the sound
of that!

55:55.519 --> 55:56.618
Sweet rhythm.

55:58.456 --> 56:02.391
Yeah, it's do or die for you
in these next few fights.

56:02.393 --> 56:03.559
I know, Eddie.

56:03.728 --> 56:04.960
Hmm.

56:04.962 --> 56:06.929
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I did.

56:08.933 --> 56:12.668
I never thought I'd see
the inside of a jail cell.

56:14.839 --> 56:17.506
It's not a pretty place,

56:18.909 --> 56:20.075
is it, Anthony?

56:20.077 --> 56:22.845
No, it's not, Eddie.

56:24.415 --> 56:28.584
Try spending six years there
instead of two days.

56:30.388 --> 56:34.089
I had six years to think
about all of my fuck-ups.

56:35.826 --> 56:38.727
There always gonna be people
who're gonna try
to knock you down

56:38.729 --> 56:39.762
and get in your head.

56:40.965 --> 56:41.930
Fuck 'em.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.634
You got a gift,

56:45.636 --> 56:47.102
and you get it
from both sides.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.705
You're a half-breed.

56:51.609 --> 56:56.745
You got the Italian heart
of a rocky marciano

56:56.747 --> 57:00.983
and the Spanish moves
of de la hoya
or Roberto duran.

57:02.019 --> 57:04.453
Yeah, don't waste
what you got, kid.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.121
Don't disappoint.

57:11.128 --> 57:13.829
You got no fuckin' excuse.

57:13.830 --> 57:16.531
It's time for you
to bring this all
to another level.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.467
All right, Eddie.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.905
Now get your ass down there
and take a shower.

57:24.108 --> 57:25.073
All right, buddy.

57:25.776 --> 57:26.842
Good work, baby.

57:55.573 --> 57:56.738
Can I help you?

57:59.610 --> 58:00.809
No, I'm just thinking.

58:01.879 --> 58:02.978
Thinking?

58:02.980 --> 58:03.912
Yeah.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.115
I used to live here.

58:12.156 --> 58:14.056
Yo, Anthony,
what are you doing
over here?

58:15.693 --> 58:16.658
Get in.

58:17.261 --> 58:18.927
No, Matty.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.796
I'm just gonna go home
to relax.

58:20.798 --> 58:22.164
Please, Anthony.
It's important.

58:23.601 --> 58:25.567
Come on.
I need someone to talk to.

58:25.569 --> 58:27.202
It'll just be an hour, tops.
I promise.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.784
His jeans were tighter
than mine.

58:42.786 --> 58:44.152
Um, with a popped collar.

58:45.756 --> 58:47.289
I'm gonna do it, pal.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.991
I'm finally gonna study hard

58:48.993 --> 58:50.993
and then take
the stockbroker's test.

58:50.995 --> 58:53.729
This time,
I'm not gonna fail. No way!

58:53.731 --> 58:55.731
Now that's what I like
to hear, Matty.

58:56.600 --> 58:57.900
Make it happen.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.234
It's because of you.

58:59.236 --> 59:02.004
I see what you do every day
and it motivates me.

59:03.274 --> 59:05.607
I'm really sorry
about that fight we got into.

59:05.609 --> 59:07.876
I should have
never took you to ac.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.913
It's all right.
Shit happens sometimes.

59:14.652 --> 59:15.651
Look at that.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.020
You'd think I'd slow down,

59:18.022 --> 59:20.589
that my libido would relax
a little as I got older.

59:21.191 --> 59:23.025
I wanna bang everything.

59:23.027 --> 59:24.760
I don't even care
how hot they are.

59:24.762 --> 59:26.695
As long as
it's a new piece of ass.

59:26.697 --> 59:29.298
There's nothing like
that first time with a girl.

59:29.300 --> 59:30.899
It's the ultimate thrill.

59:30.901 --> 59:33.602
I don't know how anybody
could just be with one girl.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.103
So you don't ever
want to get married?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.073
I don't have a Maria
in my life like you.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.743
It doesn't matter.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.645
It's all just a dream
with that girl.

59:49.186 --> 59:50.919
You said one drink.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.220
I'm gonna drive
your car home.

59:52.823 --> 59:54.790
Let's go.

59:54.792 --> 59:57.125
You're the only one
doing anything
in the neighborhood.

59:57.127 --> 59:58.860
I'm so proud of you.

59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.762
I love watching you
in that ring.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.297
You're gonna hold up
that belt one day.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.765
I fuckin' know it.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.601
-Thanks, Matty.
-I know it!

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.369
Come on, let's go.

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:08.870
Let me finish my drink.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:17.012
I really...
I need a cigarette.
I'll be right back.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.750
Excuse me, do you have
an extra cigarette?

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:22.818
Sure, sweetie.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.253
Thank you.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.023
I'll take your number too.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.927
-Um. No, I don't think so.
-No?

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:34.863
-Thanks.
-You kidding me?

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:35.931
Let's go.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:41.203
Like that hot girl is gonna
give that jerk-off her number.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.206
Let's go, Matt.

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:49.411
All right, listen.
I want a cigarette.

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:52.781
Hey buddy,
you got a cigarette?

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.416
Sorry, buddy, all out.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:55.784
What do you mean all out?

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.252
I just seen you
give that girl one.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.088
If you looked like her,
i would.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.024
But you don't,
so you're not.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.926
Look, I don't want
a problem, pal.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.428
All I want
is a lousy cigarette.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.096
And I gave you
your answer.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:10.165
So why don't you
and your friend
go fuck yourselves.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.067
All right, calm down.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.936
Are we really gonna argue
over a fuckin' cigarette?

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:15.904
Hey, man! Behind you!

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:33.121
Behind you!

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.908
-He got my fucking arm!
-You all right?

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.593
Yeah.

01:01:54.594 --> 01:01:56.277
That motherfucker should
have gave me a cigarette.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.181
You fucking pounced him!

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:02.984
That motherfucker's got a gun!
Get out of here!

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:04.119
--Shit!

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.253
The fucker shot at us!
You believe that shit?

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.289
Oh, my god.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.160
I can't be doing this
no more.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.462
We're lucky to be alive.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.232
And this is for sure
gonna get back to Enzo.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:20.869
We're probably gonna have
a sit-down over this.

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:23.972
I... I just really
don't need this shit.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.008
You're the one lucky
to be alive.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.276
I don't got much
to live for.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.846
Don't talk like this.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.748
You know that's not true.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.283
I'm just a fuck-up
that can't get
my shit together.

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:38.019
I... I shouldn't be
getting you
into these situations.

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:40.255
You got too much
going on right now.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.524
You're just better off
staying away from me.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:45.494
I don't want to stay away
from you, Matty.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:48.263
I just can't be hanging out
in bars and stuff right now.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.299
I gotta give boxing my all.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.835
I know, Anthony.

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:57.038
Where are you going?
This is your car.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:58.974
Keep it for now.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:00.375
I gotta get my shit together.

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:02.144
I'll just end up
fucking crashing it anyway,

01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:03.278
'cause I'm gettin' drunk.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:05.881
Matty!

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.350
Matty, where are you--

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:10.786
get back here!

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:13.355
I'll talk to you soon.
Get that arm looked at.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:17.092
Matty!

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:32.574
Maria!

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:35.911
Maria.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.913
What happened?

01:03:38.816 --> 01:03:39.848
Come here.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.019
What the hell happened?
Did Dominick do that to you?

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.955
Get in. Get in.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.131
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>You're gonna get us killed.</i>

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.567
I'm gonna find him.
Is he in the social club?

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:00.035
-Answer me, Maria!
-Are you crazy?

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:02.537
-Have you lost your mind?
-Maybe I have!

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:05.607
There's no way
I'm gonna let him get away
with hurting you.

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:06.842
No fucking way!

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.143
Look,
it's okay, all right?

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.311
-It's not okay.
-It is okay.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:10.846
Look, I'm over him. I'm done.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.347
I'm done with Dominick!

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.049
Just let it go!

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.251
Okay, going after him
is just gonna make it
far worse

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.352
for both of us,
all right?

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.453
Please, let it go.

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.594
What happened
to your arm?

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.863
It don't matter.
It's okay.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:30.265
It's not okay.
You need to dress it better.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.268
Let's just go
to your place.

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:46.348
What the hell did you do,
Anthony?

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:50.218
I can't believe
we both got messed up
on the same night.

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:53.655
There, that's better.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.660
I remember
taking that picture.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.396
I can't believe
you still have it.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.233
So I can look
at you every day.

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:08.403
Your mom was so pretty.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:11.907
She was beautiful.

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:14.376
She'd be real proud of you.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.479
You're doing
something special.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.516
It hasn't been
so special yet.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:22.517
It will be.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:29.491
So tell me.
What happened to your arm?

01:05:34.665 --> 01:05:36.364
Even with that bruise
on your face,

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:38.967
you're so beautiful.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:43.038
You always have been.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.123
-Your turn.
-Come on. No

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.258
no more. Come on.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.393
You piece of shit!

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.262
Please. Please,
give me a break.

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.697
That was a good one.

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.633
That's enough. It's over.

01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:16.237
What the fuck
were you thinking?

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:17.272
I was drunk.
I don't know.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:18.206
Huh?

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:20.375
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.543
No guns get shot
in my neighborhood

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:25.380
unless I give the okay
that they get shot.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:28.183
- You understand?

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:30.085
You stupid fucking moron.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.754
Not only are you
shooting off guns
in my streets,

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:36.391
you're firing at somebody
who's close to me.

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:38.460
I don't like that.
I don't like that one bit.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:39.661
I am sorry. I'm--

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.463
shut up!

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.365
Don't you say
a fucking word, man!

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:46.468
I'm so-- Mr. devino,
I'm so--

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.736
it'll never happen again,
i promise.

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.771
You're sorry. I'm sorry too.
Everybody's sorry.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.341
-So because you say that...
-I'm sorry.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.110
You should get up
and walk out, is that it?

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:56.211
I made a mistake.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:57.312
You gotta go.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.416
No! No!

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:03.718
No! No, no, no--

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.059
so, Maria,

01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:12.560
I've been thinking,

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:14.562
let's do something tonight.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.698
I wanna be able to do
different things with you

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.166
and not just stay here.

01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:22.270
So you don't like
what we've been doing
in your apartment?

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.539
Of course, I do.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.041
Let's just give it
a little time.

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:28.376
Us being seen together
right now

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.611
won't be good
for either of us.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.579
I wanna leave this place.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:33.415
I'm done with it.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.217
I'm leaving
after this next fight.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.653
Come with me.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:41.489
I can still train and box,

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:42.791
but just
in a different place.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.228
I never thought
that I would say this,

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:50.398
but I want to get out
of here, too.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:53.768
I want a different life
and I want it with you.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:05.313
Yeah, yeah, right there.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:07.215
You got it, baby. Come on!

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:08.550
Yeah, give me
some movement.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.002
Okay, give me
some movement.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:11.453
Give me a jab move.
Keep your feet moving.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:12.821
Left, right,
left, right.

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:15.457
Come on, Anthony!

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.792
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:18.792
Pump it. Yeah!

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:20.528
<i> That's it!</i>

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.374
What do you think,
we're fucking stupid?

01:08:34.845 --> 01:08:36.344
What are you talking about,
Enzo?

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.845
You didn't think
we were gonna find out,
did you?

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.216
Yeah, we find out
everything, Anthony.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.286
All right?
When are you
gonna realize that?

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.555
Enzo,
what are you talking about?

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.509
We had to take care
of those idiots

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.292
that you got in the fight
with in the bar, right?

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.263
Enzo,
you didn't have to do that.

01:08:55.265 --> 01:08:56.631
Anthony, Anthony, come on.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.800
You weren't supposed
to get in trouble anymore.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.268
Right? That's what you said.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.203
It was either you or them.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.773
I mean, which way
did you want it to go?

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:14.916
Hey, give me a minute
with him, would you?

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.721
I've been looking after you
for a long time, kid,

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:21.756
you know that.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:23.925
I think the world of you.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.227
Been watching your back

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.162
and want to point you
in the right directions

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:30.832
and make sure you got
all the good things of life.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.234
And I'd never let anybody
fuck with you.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.904
Now I'm starting to wonder

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:38.673
if I've been believing
the wrong thing all this time.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:39.941
Don't make a jerk out of me.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.845
I wouldn't do that
to you, Enzo.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.549
You remember...

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:54.589
You remember that dirty,
stinking pedophile?

01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:56.724
You beat the shit
out of him.
Remember that?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.293
Yeah.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.895
Go and do that
to this vito guy.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:03.398
And you gotta fight
with the same thing.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.433
Oh, I plan on it, Enzo.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.367
I hope so.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:09.504
Wake up, Anthony.
Come on.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.207
I love you. Okay?

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.236
Maria.

01:10:44.307 --> 01:10:45.273
Maria.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:58.386
<i> Dear Anthony...</i>

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.788
<i> This last week</i>
<i> has been amazing.</i>

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.391
<i> I thought about everything</i>
<i> we talked about.</i>

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:05.293
<i> The thought of leaving here</i>
<i> with you</i>

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.561
<i> seems too good to be true.</i>

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:09.530
<i> But I can't.</i>

01:11:09.532 --> 01:11:12.267
<i> It's just too much</i>
<i> for us both to risk.</i>

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:14.002
<i> And even though Dominick</i>
<i> can be such a jerk,</i>

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.004
<i> he's all I know.</i>

01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:17.905
<i> I've been with him</i>
<i> for so long,</i>

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.807
<i> I think it's only right</i>
<i> to go back with him</i>

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.843
<i> and give him another chance.</i>

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:23.711
<i> I wish you nothing</i>
<i> but the best,</i>

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.213
<i> and I will always remember</i>

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:26.714
<i> this wonderful time</i>
<i> we just spent together.</i>

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:28.716
<i> Love, Maria.</i>

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:34.589
Now!

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:36.291
All right. Yeah!

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:40.828
Yeah! Come on.
Move your feet now.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:43.965
Yeah! Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.633
You got him!
You got him!

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:54.409
Six, seven, eight--

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:55.543
yeah, I'm good!

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.660
-Come on!
-Get in your corner.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.835
Hey, that's what
I'm talking about!

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.470
You're on fire, Anthony.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.038
Okay? He's all yours.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:26.374
Finish him this round.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.655
Hello.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.957
<i> Is this Anthony Rodriguez?</i>

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:43.891
Yeah.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.677
<i> This is officer Johnson.</i>

01:12:45.678 --> 01:12:47.462
<i> Can you come down</i>
<i> to the station, son?</i>

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.364
<i> Something happened</i>
<i> to your mother.</i>

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:51.499
Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:54.569
Fuck New Jersey!

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:56.938
Show that prick
what Brooklyn's all about.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:00.541
Come on! Go ahead, baby.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.081
That's it,<i> jefe!</i>

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.987
Okay! Go-- go to him!
Finish him!

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.925
Now!

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:20.628
Come on now, think!

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:22.530
Oh, he's losing!

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:23.631
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.867
No!

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.135
Yes, yes, yes!

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.836
Hit him-- there you go!

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:29.904
Oh, you got him!

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.672
Yeah! Yeah!

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:35.676
Yeah, that's right, bitch!

01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:40.181
One, two, three, four...

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:45.720
<i> Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:48.189
Nine, ten.

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:49.157
You're out!

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:52.727
Yeah, that's my cousin!

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:54.695
Vito germano!
Nicky germano!

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:55.663
Come on!

01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:57.799
Awful... shit!

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:06.707
<i> Oh, Anthony...</i>

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.144
<i> Right now we're so young.</i>

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:11.946
But who knows
what the future might bring?

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.620
What the hell
is going on?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.055
I don't get it.
I really don't.

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:23.991
That kid was destroying
that vito germano.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:25.726
Come on.

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:27.895
I mean, don't think he took
one single punch

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.465
in the first round.
I didn't see it.

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:32.500
Second round, he comes on,
he's all over the place.

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:34.735
He's... he's like...
It's like he's on drugs
or something,

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.170
like a completely
different human being.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.171
What happened?

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:39.106
Maybe he is on drugs.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.241
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:41.576
I'm just saying.

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:43.144
What do you mean
you're just saying?

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:45.847
Oh, fuck you. Just sayin'.

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.181
I know you love
this kid, Enzo.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.484
I just don't know why.

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:50.585
You don't know why?

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:52.887
You know what, Dominick?

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:55.690
You've had everything
given to you, okay?

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:57.675
And maybe you hate him

01:14:57.676 --> 01:14:59.659
because he has a little bit
of puerto rican blood
in his veins,

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.762
could that be?

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:03.764
Well, you're starting to get
a little bit too comfortable

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.600
with yourself, I think.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.602
Forgettin' who's running
things around here,

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:09.737
forgettin' who's in charge.

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:13.040
I was coming up in this game,
in this world, on this planet,

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.976
before you had hair
on your fucking nut sack.

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:15.943
You, fuck--.

01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.178
Relax, Enzo, okay?

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.713
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:20.681
Good. That's good.
That's a good thing.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.884
I don't want you to think
that I don't like the kid.

01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:25.086
What, you think
that I don't want somebody

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:26.988
from our neighborhood
holding up the belt someday?

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.523
Ah, maybe you do.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.024
Yeah. Besides...

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:31.893
We love you.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.528
You love me?

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.230
Come on, Enzo.
We all do, you know that.

01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:38.065
Come on.
You know we got
that meeting with gino.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.217
A lot of people
come and go, Enzo.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.019
But you and me,
we go back a long time.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.323
You believe
I've had this joint
for over 30 years?

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.025
It's a landmark
in this neighborhood, but...

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.629
Everything else
around here is changing.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:09.931
It's a different
fuckin' world now.

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:10.898
Yeah.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.667
I mean, me,
I'm old school.

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:15.603
I just can't take this,
you know, social media,

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:18.306
websites and the cellphones,
you know?

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.708
Every time
you turn around,

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:21.909
somebody's pulling
a fucking camera
out of their pocket.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.277
- Am I right?
-It seems like it.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.047
And this social media thing

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:28.716
is gonna be the ruination
of the life we chose.

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:30.351
Yeah, I agree.

01:16:33.856 --> 01:16:34.789
Hey.

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:37.925
I got a good one for you.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.794
Let's hear it.

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:41.996
Vinny ferrato
has got a Facebook page.

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:46.734
What the fuck?

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.104
A friend of ours
has a Facebook page.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.272
What is he gonna
put on there?

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.942
His hits?
The shakedowns?

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:57.645
Pictures of him in the can?
Pictures of his dick?

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.013
-Who knows?
-What the fuck?

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:00.681
I told that prick to come in.

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.683
I'm gonna poke his heart
out with a pencil
when he shows up.

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:04.952
He's a fucking moron.
What are you gonna do?

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.954
Guys like us,
we're a dying breed.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.255
It's kind of sad.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.725
Yeah, it is sad.

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:15.163
Speaking of sad...

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:17.331
Enzo, I wanted you
to come here to give me
an explanation.

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:22.837
An explanation of what?

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:25.806
I've been hearing
some things.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:29.677
You heard some things?

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.279
A lot of people hear things.

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.116
Doesn't make it true.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:37.051
I don't know what
kind of things you've heard,

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.020
or who's been saying it.

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:41.922
But I got a funny feeling
i know who said it.

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.357
That fuckin' mutt behind me!

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:49.130
I'd bet money on that.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:50.931
He's filled your head up
with a lot of shit.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:53.434
You shouldn't believe
what he says.

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:54.702
He's full of shit.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:00.942
Thanks for the drink.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:01.842
It's you, isn't it?
You're the mutt.

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:37.745
You couldn't let him speak?

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:41.315
What, so you could hear
a pack of lies?

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.417
Come on, gino,
we been through this before.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.954
He was trying
to make a move on you!

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:52.460
Look, I did this
because I wanted to prove
my loyalty to you.

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:05.773
All right. Come on.

01:19:05.775 --> 01:19:06.841
Clean up this mess.

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:12.513
So another person
that cared about you,

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:14.749
gone.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:17.218
Yeah.

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:23.023
<i> As Anthony Rodriguez</i>
<i> was knocked out</i>
<i> in the second round,</i>

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:26.160
<i>it was much different</i>
<i>for middleweight champion,</i>
<i>Reggie Dawson,</i>

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.929
<i> who won again</i>
<i> in the first round.</i>

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.065
<i> Hey, hey, come on now.</i>
<i> No big deal.</i>

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:33.434
<i>Look at the first round</i>
<i>knockout by yours truly.</i>

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:34.835
<i> You know, I told you.</i>
<i> I can't be beat.</i>

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:36.237
<i> I cannot be beat.</i>

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:38.239
<i>I told y'all that already.</i>

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.240
<i> That's right.</i>
<i> Atlanta, Georgia, baby.</i>
<i> All day, every day.</i>

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:43.144
<i> Representin' Atlanta--</i>
<i> matter of fact, man,</i>
<i> I am Atlanta.</i>

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:44.879
<i> You feel me?</i>

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.613
<i> That's right, all the other</i>
<i> so-called boxers out here</i>

01:19:46.614 --> 01:19:48.347
<i> trying to get</i>
<i> in the ring with me,</i>

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:50.081
<i> you better step off</i>
<i> and stop wasting your time.</i>

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.952
<i> You're all gonna</i>
<i> get knocked out.</i>
<i> You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:06.967
Hey,
is that lefty Rodriguez?

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.803
The greatest boxer
of all time?

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:10.070
Yeah, right.

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:13.040
That's why
i got my ass kicked.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.009
Where the hell
have you been?

01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:16.277
I've been looking
all over for you

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.878
and haven't heard a word.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.081
I went by the pizzeria,
went by your house.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.349
You know what
your dad told me?

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:23.851
He told me
you haven't been around.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.052
He didn't know
where you were.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.588
I told you
i wasn't coming around

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.056
until I got
my stuff together.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:30.324
I just went away
for a little while.

01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:32.159
Where?

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:34.495
Does it matter?

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:37.231
I'm doing the right thing.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:39.533
I heard about Enzo.

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:41.435
I'm sorry.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.441
I see you've been
taking care of my car.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:48.409
Of course, I have.

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:50.911
I even fixed
the tail light.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.446
That's great.

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:54.148
I'm gonna need it back now.

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:56.150
That's not a problem, right?

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:58.185
Why would it be
a problem, Matty?

01:20:58.187 --> 01:20:59.353
It's your car.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.021
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.192
Are you all right, Matty?

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.095
-Is something wrong?
-No, not at all.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.597
You got the keys?

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.357
I gotta go.

01:21:19.358 --> 01:21:21.175
You need a ride?
I can drop you off
at home first.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:22.977
I can walk home.

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:24.378
Okay.

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:28.048
Are you sure
you're okay, Matty?

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.383
Of course, I am.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:30.618
I'm just in a rush.

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.052
I got somewhere to be.

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.655
Let's catch up later,
all right?

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:56.410
You know...

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.113
I'm thinking
about getting married.

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:01.081
Really, Dominick?
Come on!

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.283
Yeah.

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:04.251
You know that week
we were broken up?

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.619
It made me
really realize what I had.

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:07.554
I mean...

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.490
I'm out
getting my cock sucked
every night.

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:11.525
And she's...

01:22:12.695 --> 01:22:14.361
She's doing nothing.

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:15.562
She was crying over me

01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:18.098
at her cousin's house
somewhere out in Jersey.

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:21.702
Hard to find, Dominick.

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.270
Yeah... yeah.

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:49.730
Hey, guys.
How's it goin'?

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.032
We good, Matty?

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:53.968
Yeah, it's parked outside.
Here's the keys.

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:57.371
You know, uh...

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:01.241
You're lucky.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:05.279
You're lucky I decided
to take the car
as partial payment.

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:07.982
You know, because I'm not
really into these muscle cars.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:10.250
I'm a caddy guy myself,
as you know.

01:23:11.454 --> 01:23:12.419
You know, in fact,

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.055
I'm gonna sell your car

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:16.623
and I'm gonna get
myself another caddy.

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:21.628
Oh, it's my fault

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.764
that you're
a degenerate gambler, huh?

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:25.366
You gotta borrow
money from me

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:28.002
to keep open
that piece of shit pizzeria?

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.670
Oh, you know
you still owe
some vig on that, right?

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.072
'Cause next thing
I'm gonna do

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:34.041
is I take the pizza joint.

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:35.409
That won't be necessary,
Dominick.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:37.111
I'll have the rest
of your money.

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:38.379
Yeah.

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:39.713
Well, for your sake,
i hope so.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.317
Hey, how's your friend
doing, Anthony?

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.720
He sure got his ass kicked.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.023
And by a full-blooded
Italian, no less.

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.492
Vito germano.

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:53.060
Germano.

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:54.661
I love that name,
you know?

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:00.434
Oh, and I wonder
what he's gonna do
now that Enzo's not around.

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:05.339
Anthony Rodriguez.
What a fuckin' waste.

01:24:10.112 --> 01:24:12.312
Oh, I suggest you get
that look off of your face.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:14.782
No look from me, Dominick.

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:16.050
Enjoy the car.

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:34.368
Hey, kid,
give me that bat.

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:46.847
<i> So after all that,</i>

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:49.450
she can't even tell me
to my face

01:24:49.452 --> 01:24:50.717
that she's going back to him.

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:54.121
She was too embarrassed
to face you.

01:24:55.558 --> 01:24:57.357
I poured my heart
out to that girl.

01:24:58.227 --> 01:24:59.793
All these years
wanting her.

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:02.262
And for what?

01:25:03.799 --> 01:25:05.365
I'm done with her.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:06.600
I'm done boxing.

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:08.735
I'm fucking done
with it all.

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:10.838
What are you
talking about?

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.440
You're gonna quit boxing?
Don't talk stupid.

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.644
I'm tired of always
having to watch
everything I do.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.780
Look at you!

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.281
Always drinking,
having a good time.

01:25:21.517 --> 01:25:22.749
Me?

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:24.418
I'm sipping
on fuckin' water.

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:25.752
And for what?

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:28.188
I mean, really.

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:30.424
What's the point?

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:39.399
It's a good thing you left
your chevelle home.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:42.769
Because I ain't
in no condition
to drive it.

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.371
I lied. It's not home.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.373
I just got it painted.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:48.142
Painted?

01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:49.843
You got a sick paint job
on there already.

01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:51.245
Well, I won a lot in ac.

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:52.913
Who cares?
It's only money.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:56.350
Look at this.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.553
Of all the people
to walk in here...

01:26:25.648 --> 01:26:26.713
Relax, Anthony.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.683
I can't relax.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.818
If I wind up
staying here,

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.922
I'm gonna wind up
hurting somebody real bad.

01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:36.924
Just go home.
Forget about it.

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.760
You got too much to lose.

01:26:39.762 --> 01:26:41.962
Don't lose it with
this fucking asshole.

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.530
It's not worth it, man.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.600
You know what, Matty?

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:50.604
Ain't gonna give her
the satisfaction.

01:26:50.606 --> 01:26:54.341
If that's what she wants,
so be it.

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:55.742
They deserve each other.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.813
Come on,
let's get out of here.

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.782
Now that's
what I like to hear.

01:27:01.784 --> 01:27:04.284
Finally you grew some balls
when it comes to this girl.

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:06.353
Come on, man,
you don't need
her anyway.

01:27:06.355 --> 01:27:08.555
Listen, go home,

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.490
I'm gonna hang
out a little while.
I'll meet you later.

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:12.326
I gotta meet Mrs. Schwartz
for a drink.

01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:13.694
She finally got
a divorce.

01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:14.895
We can
meet in public.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:16.763
Mrs. Schwartz again?

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:18.498
Where do
you find these girls?

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.901
Come on, man,
i gotta get laid,
man. Come on.

01:27:24.273 --> 01:27:25.539
I love you, man.

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:28.909
Fuck them.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.753
What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:43.857
What do you mean?

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:47.995
Nothing, Dominick.
What are you
talking about?

01:27:47.997 --> 01:27:50.264
Don't make me
smack you in here.

01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:51.331
Smack me?

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.666
Yeah.

01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:57.337
Why do you gotta talk
to me like that?

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:02.643
I don't understand you,
Dominick. I'm going to
the ladies room.

01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:04.745
Yeah. You do that.
Go to the ladies room.

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:11.551
Hey.

01:28:23.766 --> 01:28:24.831
What's up,
Dominick?

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:28.402
You know i--

01:28:28.404 --> 01:28:31.805
I've been thinking
about something since--
since after you left.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:32.873
I think I'm gonna keep
the chevelle.

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.078
Yeah, and drive it around
once in a while, you know?

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.514
I think it'll be a good
statement for me.

01:28:40.516 --> 01:28:42.949
Because everybody knows
that was your car

01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:46.420
and everybody knows
what a fuck-up you are.

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:49.523
And they'll know
that you fucked up with me.

01:28:51.527 --> 01:28:53.860
Yeah, yeah,
how about I get you
a drink?

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.898
Ow! You motherfucker!

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:07.040
He's got a gun.
Let's get out of here.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.681
I want your girlfriend

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.683
and everybody to see
what a bitch you are

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:17.918
without your
friends around.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.119
You're fucking dead.

01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:20.554
Matty, you kn-- ow.

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:21.655
Matty, stop!

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.825
Stop?

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:26.126
--Shut up.

01:29:29.631 --> 01:29:30.997
Matty, please.

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.466
I don't know what's wrong
with you, girl.

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:34.935
Stop it.

01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:36.603
-Stop.
-What's wrong with you?

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:38.105
Get out of here, Matty. Go.

01:29:38.107 --> 01:29:40.040
Just go!
Get the fuck out!

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.608
I never liked you.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:44.444
Please, stop.

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:47.614
I don't know.

01:30:38.534 --> 01:30:39.900
Come on, Tommy!

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:41.868
Please!

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:45.605
I mean,
we known each other
since we're kids.

01:30:46.842 --> 01:30:48.008
Fuckin' kids!

01:30:50.746 --> 01:30:53.814
You're gonna do it
because of that piece
of shit Dominick? Come on!

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.083
-Just shut up, Matty.
-Please, stop!

01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:59.119
We known each
other since we're kids, Tommy!

01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:00.487
- Shut up, Matty.
-Please.

01:31:03.659 --> 01:31:05.192
You know what?

01:31:05.194 --> 01:31:06.760
Fuck you, guys.

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:08.962
Go ahead.

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:11.832
Fuck you! Go ahead!

01:31:21.944 --> 01:31:23.176
<i> He did it all for me.</i>

01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:25.979
<i> That's how he was.</i>

01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:28.748
<i> He always put me first.</i>

01:31:30.986 --> 01:31:32.519
<i> In the end,</i>

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:35.856
<i> he took a bullet for me.</i>

01:31:38.794 --> 01:31:40.527
<i> How did you deal with that?</i>

01:32:37.319 --> 01:32:39.786
Whoa, come on,
Anthony!

01:32:39.788 --> 01:32:42.822
Anthony, you don't
want to do this.

01:32:42.824 --> 01:32:45.158
You don't want to shoot
an unarmed man, come on.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.927
Come on, look,

01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:48.895
don't do this, man.
We known each other
since we were kids.

01:32:50.165 --> 01:32:51.865
Put the gun
down, Anthony.

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:54.167
Fuck you, Dominick!

01:33:17.059 --> 01:33:19.793
-Who is it?
-Open up, Anthony.

01:33:26.735 --> 01:33:28.001
Hello, Anthony.

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:31.938
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.240
-Listen, son.
-Don't call me your son.

01:33:34.242 --> 01:33:37.677
Whether you like it
or not, you are.

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:40.013
All I'm asking is you give
me a minute to hear me out.

01:33:40.015 --> 01:33:41.281
That's all I ask.

01:33:43.085 --> 01:33:45.385
-I really don't care what you
have to say.
-Please.

01:33:46.355 --> 01:33:48.922
Just let me speak.

01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:50.790
There is nothing
to speak about.

01:33:52.194 --> 01:33:54.160
I buried you a long time ago.

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:56.196
I know you did,

01:33:56.198 --> 01:33:59.766
and you had
every right to. But...

01:33:59.768 --> 01:34:02.302
Just hear me out
and I will leave.

01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:07.307
It took me years.

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.676
Years to forgive myself
for what I did to you

01:34:09.678 --> 01:34:12.045
and your mom,
god rest her soul.

01:34:13.348 --> 01:34:15.882
I was a horrible
father and husband,

01:34:16.652 --> 01:34:18.151
but it wasn't me.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:20.387
It was the alcohol.

01:34:20.389 --> 01:34:22.288
It destroyed me.

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:24.724
But I've been sober
now for years.

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:29.963
I've watched almost all
your fights from a distance
and

01:34:29.965 --> 01:34:32.065
you didn't know I was there.

01:34:32.067 --> 01:34:34.634
I didn't have the courage
to face you,

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:37.202
because I knew if I did,
you would tell me to get lost.

01:34:38.874 --> 01:34:40.907
All I ask that you give me
a chance to show you

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:43.276
that I've changed.

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:46.046
I'm old now.

01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:51.451
And what I want is
to share the rest of my days
with you.

01:34:52.754 --> 01:34:55.088
You're my son,
my blood,

01:34:56.958 --> 01:34:59.192
and you've made me proud.

01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:02.962
You made me proud.

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:06.066
Please, Anthony,

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:08.968
find a way to
forgive me.

01:35:10.272 --> 01:35:12.005
And if you find it
in your heart,

01:35:12.974 --> 01:35:14.307
give me a chance.

01:35:23.452 --> 01:35:26.286
Just like that,
after all those years,

01:35:28.423 --> 01:35:30.724
he shows up
on my doorstep.

01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:35.028
Just before I was
walking out the door

01:35:36.031 --> 01:35:37.397
<i> to ruin my whole life.</i>

01:35:42.104 --> 01:35:43.503
<i> When I look back at it,</i>

01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:48.041
<i>I feel like it was a message</i>
<i>from my mom,</i>

01:35:48.877 --> 01:35:50.510
<i> that my dad showed up.</i>

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.012
<i> I needed a break</i>

01:35:54.382 --> 01:35:56.282
<i> from the only world</i>
<i> that I knew.</i>

01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:32.555
<i> It's because of you.</i>

01:38:32.556 --> 01:38:34.606
<i> I see what you do</i>
<i> every day and</i>
<i> it motivates me.</i>

01:38:36.611 --> 01:38:39.178
<i>You're the only one doing</i>
<i>anything in the neighborhood.</i>

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.080
<i> I'm so proud of you.</i>

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:43.182
<i> I love watching you</i>
<i> in that ring.</i>

01:38:43.184 --> 01:38:45.685
<i> You're gonna hold up</i>
<i> that belt one day.</i>
<i> I know it!</i>

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.434
<i> You can do something better</i>
<i> with your life.</i>

01:39:04.973 --> 01:39:06.673
<i> You're gonna do something</i>
<i> better. I don't know</i>
<i> what it is,</i>

01:39:06.675 --> 01:39:08.608
<i> but it's gonna be huge.</i>

01:39:16.184 --> 01:39:17.517
<i> I'm very proud of you.</i>

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:25.358
<i> I know it hasn't been easy</i>
<i> with your father</i>
<i> the last couple of years,</i>

01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:30.096
<i> but you made</i>
<i> everything better.</i>

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.433
<i> You brightened up every day.</i>

01:40:04.032 --> 01:40:05.231
--Come on.

01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:08.534
We not ballet dancing,
this is boxing, come on!

01:40:08.536 --> 01:40:09.569
- Eddie!
-Watch your body.

01:40:10.038 --> 01:40:11.204
Yeah, what?

01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:12.338
Phone call!

01:40:14.309 --> 01:40:15.308
Keep jabbing.

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.612
Yeah? Hello.

01:40:19.614 --> 01:40:21.114
I'm ready.

01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:24.150
Hey-- Anthony?

01:40:27.722 --> 01:40:29.088
Anthony, where
you been?

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:31.157
Get me a rematch
with germano.

01:40:32.794 --> 01:40:35.528
I thought you were done
and it was over with.

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:37.196
Nah, it's far
from over, Eddie.

01:40:37.732 --> 01:40:39.065
Set it up.

01:40:39.434 --> 01:40:40.466
Yeah.

01:40:46.174 --> 01:40:47.407
Yeah.

01:40:51.646 --> 01:40:53.413
Remember the bag
in the basement!

01:40:53.415 --> 01:40:54.747
He's going-- I see it!
He hit it!

01:40:54.749 --> 01:40:56.516
Lookin' sweet.
You own him!

01:40:56.518 --> 01:40:58.317
That's who his daddy is!

01:40:59.821 --> 01:41:01.621
Come on, vito!
What the fuck, man?

01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:06.325
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:41:06.327 --> 01:41:08.127
This is not what you were
taught, come on!

01:41:08.129 --> 01:41:09.495
Nine, ten, that's it.

01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:12.832
All right, Anthony!

01:41:12.834 --> 01:41:14.467
Huh? You love that!

01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:16.136
No! No!

01:41:16.137 --> 01:41:17.804
<i> -It was a different</i>
<i> story this time...</i>
-That's my son!

01:41:17.806 --> 01:41:20.040
<i> ...for vito germano,</i>

01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:22.275
<i> who was knocked out</i>
<i> halfway through</i>
<i> the first round</i>

01:41:22.277 --> 01:41:25.144
<i>by Anthony "lefty" Rodriguez.</i>

01:41:25.146 --> 01:41:28.081
<i> Come on, Anthony, go!</i>
<i> Get him off you!</i>
<i> Come on!</i>

01:41:30.618 --> 01:41:31.784
Knock him out, son!

01:41:31.786 --> 01:41:32.852
You got him, baby!

01:41:35.123 --> 01:41:36.823
There you go!
There you go!

01:41:36.825 --> 01:41:39.258
He's down! He's down!
He's down!

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:41.661
That's it, Italian power!
Puerto rican power!

01:41:50.572 --> 01:41:52.171
Blue to corner.

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:55.541
Yeah, yeah!
That's my boy!

01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:03.816
Yes! He's all yours!
That's it!

01:42:03.818 --> 01:42:05.585
Finish him off!
Finish him off!

01:42:16.564 --> 01:42:17.797
Blue to corner.

01:42:17.799 --> 01:42:19.732
Knock him out, son!

01:42:19.734 --> 01:42:20.900
We're ready.

01:42:20.902 --> 01:42:23.870
Five, six, seven...

01:42:23.872 --> 01:42:25.238
We're ready!

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.242
Eight, nine, ten, out!

01:42:29.244 --> 01:42:30.743
We're ready! Ha-ha!

01:42:31.346 --> 01:42:32.545
Yeah!

01:42:51.432 --> 01:42:52.565
Neighborhood kid.

01:42:52.567 --> 01:42:54.200
He's representing, gino.

01:42:54.202 --> 01:42:55.568
He sure is.

01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:58.271
I hope he opens up
Dawson's fuckin' hole.

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:02.942
<i> It's a big payday</i>
<i> for Anthony Rodriguez</i>

01:43:02.944 --> 01:43:06.612
<i> as he is set to fight</i>
<i> undisputed middleweight</i>
<i> champion Reggie Dawson.</i>

01:43:06.614 --> 01:43:09.031
<i> As well as</i>
<i> he's been fighting,</i>

01:43:09.032 --> 01:43:11.449
<i> I still don't think</i>
<i> he stands a chance</i>
<i> against Dawson.</i>

01:43:11.452 --> 01:43:13.853
<i> Dawson is just</i>
<i> too explosive.</i>

01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:16.789
<i> He barely gets hit</i>
<i> and he's never</i>
<i> been knocked down.</i>

01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:19.926
<i> I really don't see</i>
<i> Rodriguez getting out</i>
<i> of the first round.</i>

01:43:19.928 --> 01:43:21.661
<i> Yo, are you kidding me?</i>

01:43:22.297 --> 01:43:24.497
<i> Anthony who?</i>

01:43:24.499 --> 01:43:27.366
<i>What's up with all this</i>
<i>Brooklyn stuff? Brooklyn this,</i>
<i>Brooklyn that.</i>

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:28.601
<i> - Who gives a damn?</i>
<i>- Brooklyn?</i>

01:43:32.307 --> 01:43:33.472
Look, son,

01:43:34.442 --> 01:43:35.975
we came from a rough
neighborhood

01:43:35.977 --> 01:43:39.212
and it wasn't easy being
a puerto rican there back then.

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:41.981
But that didn't break you.

01:43:41.983 --> 01:43:44.817
And neither will this
punk Dawson.

01:43:44.819 --> 01:43:46.819
You knock him out,
you hear?

01:43:46.821 --> 01:43:48.387
You hit him hard.

01:43:53.328 --> 01:43:55.962
These last few months
with you have been the
best time of my life.

01:43:57.665 --> 01:43:59.432
Thank you.

01:43:59.434 --> 01:44:00.833
You don't have
to thank me, dad.

01:44:01.703 --> 01:44:02.902
I'm glad you're here.

01:44:04.239 --> 01:44:06.005
You've been a big
inspiration to me.

01:44:07.375 --> 01:44:08.941
Your mother would be proud,

01:44:10.945 --> 01:44:13.279
<i> mi maravilloso hijo.</i>

01:44:14.983 --> 01:44:16.415
What does that mean?

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.618
My wonderful son.

01:44:21.723 --> 01:44:24.457
So you go out there
and you show the whole
world what you're about,

01:44:24.459 --> 01:44:25.491
you hear?

01:44:39.741 --> 01:44:41.374
Anthony.

01:44:42.977 --> 01:44:44.810
Don't mean to disturb
your focus,

01:44:44.812 --> 01:44:47.480
but there's somebody
outside that really wants to
talk to you.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:58.424
Anthony Rodriguez.

01:44:59.427 --> 01:45:01.060
Mike Tyson.

01:45:01.062 --> 01:45:03.829
Man, I just came by to wish
a Brooklyn brother some luck,
that's all.

01:45:03.831 --> 01:45:06.332
Speaking about Brooklyn,
you hear all that shit

01:45:06.334 --> 01:45:08.601
that Dawson is
talking about,
dumping on Brooklyn?

01:45:08.603 --> 01:45:10.503
I'm from Brooklyn
just like you,

01:45:10.505 --> 01:45:12.338
and I took that personally.

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.407
Dawson's always talkin'
a lot of shit.

01:45:14.409 --> 01:45:16.075
He's been able to
back it up, too

01:45:16.077 --> 01:45:17.843
this time it's gonna be
different, right?

01:45:17.845 --> 01:45:19.912
You're gonna prove
all these cocksuckers wrong

01:45:19.914 --> 01:45:22.014
making you the
25-to-1 underdog.

01:45:22.016 --> 01:45:25.017
You gonna go in there
and you gonna kick
his ass in the dirt.

01:45:25.019 --> 01:45:27.720
All of Brooklyn
is behind you
out here.

01:45:28.890 --> 01:45:31.524
You got this, man.
Trust me, you got this.

01:45:43.738 --> 01:45:46.405
<i> The crowd's electric here at</i>
<i> Caesar's palace</i>

01:45:46.407 --> 01:45:49.809
<i>as the fighter from Brooklyn</i>
<i>Anthony "lefty" Rodriguez</i>

01:45:49.811 --> 01:45:51.644
<i> makes his way to the ring.</i>

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:53.846
Get ready, get in there!

01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:54.980
Knock him out!
Knock him out!

01:45:54.982 --> 01:45:56.916
Oh, that's it.

01:45:56.918 --> 01:45:58.851
Oh, man, stack it up!

01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:00.386
There you go!
There you go!

01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:01.620
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn!

01:46:06.828 --> 01:46:08.928
<i> It's all up to you, Anthony.</i>

01:46:10.631 --> 01:46:14.133
<i> Everything you've been</i>
<i> through in your life,</i>

01:46:15.503 --> 01:46:17.403
<i> it's your time to</i>
<i> make history.</i>

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:18.537
Stay on him!
See, he's goin'!

01:46:23.578 --> 01:46:25.010
The rest is history, Larry.

01:46:26.681 --> 01:46:29.548
After all I went through
back in the day,

01:46:30.785 --> 01:46:32.852
when my mom was alive,

01:46:32.854 --> 01:46:35.621
that was the greatest
time of my life.

01:46:35.623 --> 01:46:40.059
<i> So has boxing</i>
<i> become an escape from</i>

01:46:40.061 --> 01:46:42.895
<i> the real violence</i>
<i> in your life?</i>

01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.997
<i>Or is it part of who you are?</i>

01:46:44.999 --> 01:46:49.835
<i> Part of the rock</i>
<i> your mother was?</i>

01:46:49.837 --> 01:46:51.971
I always felt like
my mom was in
my corner

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.807
<i>through every fight,</i>

01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:56.609
<i>through every day.</i>

01:46:56.611 --> 01:46:59.445
<i>I know she's</i>
<i>looking over me right now.</i>

01:46:59.447 --> 01:47:02.047
And whatever happened
to Maria?

01:47:02.049 --> 01:47:05.484
As far as I know,
she's still
living around here.

01:47:05.486 --> 01:47:07.520
I heard her
and Dominick got married.

01:47:07.722 --> 01:47:08.854
Wow.

01:47:10.825 --> 01:47:14.560
I thought he'd be
up the river,

01:47:14.562 --> 01:47:16.462
-behind bars by now.
-Yeah.

01:47:16.464 --> 01:47:18.464
Yeah, you
and everybody else.

01:47:18.466 --> 01:47:20.666
He has a much smaller
crew now, so I heard.

01:47:21.903 --> 01:47:25.671
So in a way,
us meeting here,

01:47:25.673 --> 01:47:27.606
is a kind
of a statement.

01:47:28.576 --> 01:47:30.676
"I'm not afraid
of anyone."

01:47:30.678 --> 01:47:31.944
No, I'm not,

01:47:31.946 --> 01:47:34.580
and that mob world,
it's changed so much.

01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:38.784
You got these gangsters
on reality shows
right now.

01:47:38.786 --> 01:47:40.119
It's a joke.

01:47:40.922 --> 01:47:42.822
The joke's on them,

01:47:42.824 --> 01:47:45.124
because
you're no joke.

01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:47.893
You're the
middleweight champion.

01:47:47.895 --> 01:47:50.129
They can never
take away that
achievement.

01:47:51.165 --> 01:47:52.531
Thanks, Larry.

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.937
Way to go, Anthony!
Way to go, champ!

01:47:59.907 --> 01:48:01.173
You earned it.

01:48:01.175 --> 01:48:02.808
Thank you, buddy.

01:48:04.479 --> 01:48:05.644
Way to go.

01:48:06.214 --> 01:48:07.713
Sure, yeah, go ahead.

01:48:15.656 --> 01:48:16.989
I heard that
you were here.

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.893
Being interviewed
by Larry merchant,

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:24.263
that's big time.

01:48:24.265 --> 01:48:25.798
I told you that
you would do it.

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.866
Thank you.

01:48:30.771 --> 01:48:33.873
So you know,
me and Dominick,
we got separated.

01:48:33.875 --> 01:48:36.976
Really? That's too bad.

01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:39.612
Yeah, actually it's mutual.

01:48:39.614 --> 01:48:42.214
He's seeing some slut
in staten island.

01:48:43.985 --> 01:48:46.886
-What about you?
-Me?

01:48:46.888 --> 01:48:50.689
I've been waiting
for you to come back here
and rescue me.

01:48:55.663 --> 01:48:57.296
Don't tell me that
you don't miss me.

01:48:58.733 --> 01:49:00.599
'Cause I miss you
so much.

01:49:02.236 --> 01:49:04.870
Could you
ever forgive me?

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:06.672
Of course, I could
forgive you, Maria.

01:49:07.608 --> 01:49:09.108
I even forgave my father.

01:49:13.681 --> 01:49:15.180
But I can't be
with you again.

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:17.550
Those days are gone.

01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:20.986
Are you serious?

01:49:22.123 --> 01:49:23.789
I'm dead serious.

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:30.029
I'm sorry you
feel that way.

01:49:38.005 --> 01:49:39.605
Shit.

01:49:39.607 --> 01:49:40.839
Dominick's here.

01:49:51.285 --> 01:49:53.819
Why do you look
so nervous, Maria?

01:49:53.821 --> 01:49:55.654
You can do whatever
you want now.

01:49:58.726 --> 01:50:01.727
You know, I must say,
Rodriguez,
you shocked me.

01:50:03.064 --> 01:50:04.697
You proved Enzo right.

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:07.733
Now, I call a spade
a spade.

01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:10.636
You did it.
Congratulations.

01:50:14.141 --> 01:50:15.774
You're not gonna
shake my hand?

01:50:17.878 --> 01:50:20.346
Don't think for a minute
that I didn't know you two
wanted each other

01:50:21.749 --> 01:50:23.082
okay?

01:50:23.084 --> 01:50:24.817
And now you can
have each other.

01:50:28.089 --> 01:50:31.156
What, did you think
you could just
come back here? Huh?

01:50:31.158 --> 01:50:32.358
To my neighborhood?

01:50:35.730 --> 01:50:37.396
You know what?
I'll see you outside.

01:50:40.635 --> 01:50:43.769
Do you really think
i give a fuck about
you and your friend?

01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:45.204
I've been waiting
my whole life

01:50:45.206 --> 01:50:48.107
to tell you what
a fuckin' punk
i think you are,

01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:50.275
and I will see
you outside.

01:50:52.279 --> 01:50:54.980
You don't change, Dominick.
Go fuck yourself.

01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:10.362
Okay, thank you.

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.200
What are you,
fuckin' stupid?

01:51:15.202 --> 01:51:17.036
I'm so sorry, Mr. dom--

01:51:17.038 --> 01:51:19.238
hey, how do
you like it, huh?

01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:25.077
What's the matter,
they can't hire better busboys
at this joint?

01:51:28.015 --> 01:51:29.782
Leave him alone,
Dominick.

01:51:33.688 --> 01:51:36.455
Of course, one spic

01:51:37.324 --> 01:51:39.458
defending another spic.

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:41.427
Oh, shit.

01:51:41.429 --> 01:51:43.028
Go back to work.

01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:44.263
I got this, dino.

01:51:44.265 --> 01:51:45.431
All right, Anthony.

01:51:48.035 --> 01:51:50.069
You're such a jerk-off,
Dominick.

01:51:56.477 --> 01:51:57.810
He's a boxer, right?

01:52:03.784 --> 01:52:04.850
You want some?

01:52:04.852 --> 01:52:05.984
Uh...

01:52:08.889 --> 01:52:10.823
Get that fuckin' camera
out of my face!

01:52:10.825 --> 01:52:12.725
Oh, shit.

01:52:12.727 --> 01:52:14.126
What are you staring at,
you bald headed prick?

01:52:14.128 --> 01:52:15.427
Shoot him!

01:52:17.331 --> 01:52:19.264
Go ahead. Shoot me.

01:52:24.038 --> 01:52:27.206
You fuckin' pussy! I knew
i shouldn't have let you
in my fucking crew.

01:52:28.409 --> 01:52:30.242
Crew?

01:52:30.244 --> 01:52:32.344
This isn't 1989 anymore,
Dominick.

01:52:36.984 --> 01:52:38.150
Oh, shit.

01:52:40.755 --> 01:52:43.789
Hey, that was awesome.

01:52:43.791 --> 01:52:45.457
Don't be puttin' that
on YouTube, sal.

01:52:48.462 --> 01:52:51.430
On second thought,
do whatever you want.

01:52:52.066 --> 01:52:53.198
Yeah?

01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:05.894
-Ooh.
-What are you looking at,
you prick?

01:53:05.895 --> 01:53:07.478
-What do you think?
-Get that fucking camera
out of my face.

01:53:19.193 --> 01:53:21.960
You can do something better
with your life.

01:53:21.962 --> 01:53:23.228
You're gonna do
something better.

01:53:23.230 --> 01:53:25.264
I don't know what it is,
but it's gonna be huge.

01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:38.844
The people from
olive garden came by.

01:53:38.846 --> 01:53:43.015
They offered me four mil
for the building
and the restaurant.

01:53:43.017 --> 01:53:45.067
Like I'm really
gonna sell out.

01:53:45.068 --> 01:53:47.118
I said, "not in my
fucking lifetime,"
right, Rocco?

01:53:47.121 --> 01:53:48.821
We know that, gino.

01:53:48.823 --> 01:53:49.988
Aw, fuck.

01:53:53.194 --> 01:53:55.394
I wanted to come by
and tell you that

01:53:55.396 --> 01:53:59.031
I'm whacking that spic,
Anthony Rodriguez.

01:53:59.033 --> 01:54:02.334
World champion or not,
i don't give a fuck!

01:54:02.336 --> 01:54:05.170
That cocksucker put
his hands on a made man.

01:54:05.472 --> 01:54:07.539
Broke my rib.

01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:10.609
Yeah, we heard all about
your escapade
in front of la palina.

01:54:10.611 --> 01:54:14.847
In fact, there's
a video of it all over
the fuckin' place.

01:54:14.849 --> 01:54:17.115
I think maybe you're in the
wrong business, Dominick.

01:54:17.117 --> 01:54:19.952
You should have been
an actor. Seems like
you love the attention.

01:54:23.257 --> 01:54:25.123
We all make mistakes.

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:28.560
My mistake was believing
a fucking mutt like you.

01:54:30.297 --> 01:54:33.198
Remember when Enzo
used that word
to describe you?

01:54:34.501 --> 01:54:36.401
Well, he was right!

01:54:36.403 --> 01:54:37.536
Fuck, Enzo!

01:55:14.275 --> 01:55:16.541
Hi, Anthony.
Just one minute.

01:55:18.913 --> 01:55:21.413
<i> No, Tommy!</i>

01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:23.348
- Please, don't.

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:25.484
We known each other
since we were kids, Tommy!

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:32.124
Oh.

01:55:33.661 --> 01:55:36.094
That's right,
we did grow up together.

01:55:36.096 --> 01:55:39.064
Don't ever show your
face around here again.

01:55:39.066 --> 01:55:41.133
-Okay.
-As far as
everybody's concerned,

01:55:41.135 --> 01:55:44.703
you're dead and buried!
You got that, Matty?

01:55:44.705 --> 01:55:47.306
Yeah, Tommy, thank you,
yeah, thank you.

01:55:47.942 --> 01:55:49.041
Thank you, Tommy.

01:56:01.388 --> 01:56:03.055
I'll call you
later, okay?

01:56:03.057 --> 01:56:05.290
Okay. Bye, Matty.

01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:13.031
So, how is this one?

01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:15.534
You know, I actually
like this girl.

01:56:15.536 --> 01:56:17.102
I think I'm gonna
settle down.

01:56:17.104 --> 01:56:19.104
Yeah, okay.

01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:23.608
On second thought, nah!

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.555
By the way,
how was the interview?

01:56:36.557 --> 01:56:39.091
What was it like
going back to the old
neighborhood?

01:56:40.127 --> 01:56:42.094
Come on, champ.
Tell me what happened.

01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:45.097
You're gonna love it.

01:57:35.716 --> 01:57:39.351
We couldn't do this
in Brooklyn when
we were shooting the movie,

01:57:39.353 --> 01:57:42.621
but this is how
we really do it
in real life.

01:57:42.623 --> 01:57:44.222
Brooklyn style, baby.
