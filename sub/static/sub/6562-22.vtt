HAVE TO DO WITH STRIKING?

06:01.067 --> 06:03.800
- UM, I'M STRIKING.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.367

I WANT TO MAKE GOOD USE

USE ONE OF MY SIGNS.

06:20.933 --> 06:21.933

06:21.933 --> 06:23.900
- IT STATES ALL OF OUR DEMANDS

06:23.900 --> 06:27.267
AND WHY WE FEEL GUSTAVO'S WORK
PRACTICES ARE UNJUST AND UNFAIR.

06:27.267 --> 06:29.233

06:48.633 --> 06:49.967
- YEAH, WELL, SO IS BEING A MOM.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.700
AND I HAVE A LOT
OF OTHER THINGS TO DO

06:51.700 --> 06:53.500
BESIDES FEEDING
THE PICKET LINES.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
- LIKE WHAT?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.300
[dramatic music]

06:57.300 --> 07:00.300
- I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT BEING A FULL-TIME MOM

07:00.300 --> 07:01.767
IS ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS
THERE IS.

07:01.767 --> 07:05.200
YOU HAVE TO BE A CHEF,
HOUSEKEEPER, NURSE, TUTOR,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.300
REFEREE, SEAMSTRESS,
CHAUFFEUR.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.967

- MOM, I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

07:10.867 --> 07:12.900
BUT COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.167
- OH, REALLY?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.667
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
GO ON STRIKE.

07:16.667 --> 07:20.067
AND THEN MAYBE YOU'D KNOW
HOW HARD I WORK AROUND HERE.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

07:21.300 --> 07:22.667
- [sarcastically]
OOH, I'M SCARED.

07:24.267 --> 07:25.400

07:25.400 --> 07:26.967
KIDS WHO APPRECIATE
HOW HARD MOMS WORK.

07:26.967 --> 07:27.967

NOW!

07:32.633 --> 07:33.833
- UNBELIEVABLE.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.433
- KIDS WHO APPRECIATE
HOW HARD MOMS WORK!

07:35.433 --> 07:36.500
WHEN DO I WANT IT?
NOW!

07:36.500 --> 07:37.633
WHAT DO I WANT?

07:37.633 --> 07:39.633
KIDS WHO APPRECIATE
HOW HARD MOMS WORK!

07:40.900 --> 07:43.833
[both shouting]

07:45.567 --> 07:46.967
- [cackles]
PERFECT.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.067
FIGHTING AMONGST THEMSELVES,

07:49.067 --> 07:52.167
THE FIRST SIGN
OF A DYING STRIKE.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.500
[cackles]

07:53.500 --> 07:55.567
- WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY
ABOUT THIS?

07:55.567 --> 07:58.733
- BECAUSE THE DOGS
WILL EXHAUST THEMSELVES,

07:58.733 --> 08:01.400
REALIZE THEIR STRIKE IS STUPID,

08:01.400 --> 08:03.633
AND THEN COME CRAWLING BACK
TO PAPA BEAR.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.267
- WELL, THEY BETTER CRAWL FAST,

08:05.267 --> 08:06.767
BECAUSE ACCORDING
TO MY SCHEDULE,

08:06.767 --> 08:07.900
GRIFFIN WANTS TO HEAR

08:07.900 --> 08:09.700
THE NEW SONG
FOR THE NEW ALBUM TOMORROW,

08:09.700 --> 08:12.367
AND THERE'S JUST
ONE TINY THING WE'RE MISSING:

08:12.367 --> 08:14.333
THE NEW SONG FOR THE NEW ALBUM.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.567
- THEY STARTED IT!

08:15.567 --> 08:17.067
- YEAH, BUT DID YOU
HAVE TO SHOCK THEM?

08:17.067 --> 08:18.467
- YES!

08:18.467 --> 08:20.233
MAYBE NOT.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.500
FINE.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.667
JUST GET THE DOGS UP HERE
SO WE CAN SETTLE THIS.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.700
- [whispering]
HI, KELLY.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.167
- STOP BEING NICE.
YOU'RE THE MUSCLE.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.367
- BUT I MISS HER,
AND I MISS SINGING.

08:32.367 --> 08:34.500
- YOU CAN'T TELL THEM THAT.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.433
- I TAPED BACK TOGETHER
YOUR DEMANDS,

08:36.433 --> 08:38.200
AND IF BIG TIME RUSH AGREES

08:38.200 --> 08:40.333
TO GET BACK IN THE STUDIO
RIGHT NOW,

08:40.333 --> 08:42.700
I WILL STOP
MOST OF THE SHOCKING.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.667
[loud smack]

08:43.667 --> 08:44.667
OW!

08:44.667 --> 08:46.400
ALL OF THE SHOCKING.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.933
- AND OUR OTHER DEMANDS?

08:47.933 --> 08:49.933
- GUYS, YOUR OTHER DEMANDS
ARE RIDICULOUS.

08:49.933 --> 08:52.567
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE
A PETTING ZOO IN THE STUDIO.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.567
- [whispering]
THEY SOUND SCARED.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.833
- I AM NOT SCARED OF YOU.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.367
DON'T YOU PUSH IT.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.767
- HERE WE GO.

09:05.767 --> 09:09.100
- GUSTAVO, WE BOTH KNOW
THAT I'M WEARING A TIE.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.833
AND WE ALSO KNOW

09:10.833 --> 09:13.600
THAT GRIFFIN WANTS A NEW SONG
FROM BIG TIME RUSH TOMORROW.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.433
- AND WE'RE BIG TIME RUSH,
WHICH MEANS...

09:16.433 --> 09:17.367
WHERE'S MY HAIR SALON?

09:19.467 --> 09:21.433
- AND I'M GUSTAVO ROCQUE,

09:21.433 --> 09:24.633
WHICH MEANS I CAN HAVE ANYONE
RECORD THE NEW SONG,

09:24.633 --> 09:26.533
WORK MY MAGIC
ON THE SOUND BOARD,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.867
AND JUST TELL GRIFFIN
IT'S YOU DOGS.

09:30.933 --> 09:32.200
- IS THAT A THREAT?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.300
BECAUSE WE
CAN BE THREATENING TOO.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.867
CARLOS, SHOW HIM.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.167
- YEAH.

09:37.167 --> 09:38.700
YOU SEE THIS?

09:38.700 --> 09:41.100
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BACK
UNTIL YOU'RE NICER TO US.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.200
[deflated trumpet fanfare]

09:42.200 --> 09:44.433
- [sighs]

09:44.433 --> 09:46.400
- YEAH, SUPER TALENTED
TALENT AGENCY?

09:46.400 --> 09:50.233
YEAH, SEND OVER EVERY
HOT SINGING BOY TEEN IN L.A.

09:50.233 --> 09:53.900
TO ROCQUE RECORDS NOW.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.567
- OH, YEAH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

09:55.567 --> 09:59.333
- BECAUSE THEY'LL NEVER
GET PAST OUR PICKET LINE.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.867
- YOU MEAN THE PICKET LINE
THAT'S UP HERE

10:00.867 --> 10:02.667
INSTEAD OF OUT FRONT?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.667
all: YEAH!

10:04.667 --> 10:06.600
[all shouting]

10:09.167 --> 10:10.967
[tires screeching]

10:10.967 --> 10:12.867
- HEY, I BROUGHT YOU GUYS
SOME LUNCH.

10:12.867 --> 10:15.300
I HOPE YOU LIKE MUSTARD, BECAUSE
I MADE MUSTARD SANDWICHES.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.833
- BAD TIMING, KATIE.
WE MIGHT BE UNDER ATTACK.

10:17.833 --> 10:21.567
- I BROUGHT SOME WATER TOO.

10:21.567 --> 10:24.767
[dramatic music]

10:24.767 --> 10:26.200
- IT'S STARTING...

10:26.200 --> 10:28.833
[people shouting]

10:28.833 --> 10:30.100
- I'M FREAKING OUT!

10:30.100 --> 10:32.733
- WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
NO ONE GETS INSIDE.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.933
I MEAN, HOW MANY CAN THERE BE?

10:37.867 --> 10:39.833
- OH, THIS IS GOOD.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.800
[crowd shouting]

10:42.800 --> 10:43.867
- THIS IS BAD!

10:43.867 --> 10:45.200
- THIS IS SO BAD!

10:45.200 --> 10:46.867
[crowd shouting]

10:46.867 --> 10:49.767
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

10:54.100 --> 10:55.367
- SPLIT UP!

10:55.367 --> 10:57.533
- AH!

10:57.533 --> 10:58.533
- BACK OFF!

10:58.533 --> 11:00.700
I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE IT.

11:00.700 --> 11:04.200
[rock music]

11:04.200 --> 11:05.233
- WAIT!

11:05.233 --> 11:06.400
YOU'RE MISSING THE AUDITIONS

11:06.400 --> 11:08.933
FOR THE NEW TAYLOR LAUTNER
BUDDY COMEDY!

11:08.933 --> 11:12.533
[crowd murmuring]

11:12.533 --> 11:14.467
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
FELLAS, FELLAS, FELLAS, HEY!

11:14.467 --> 11:17.433
LET'S NOT FIGHT.
LET'S TALK THIS OUT, HUH?

11:17.433 --> 11:19.733
CARLOS,
WHAT KIND OF MUSCLE ARE YOU?

11:19.733 --> 11:20.767
- HE'S GOT MUSTARD!

11:20.767 --> 11:21.767
- YEAH!

11:21.767 --> 11:25.567
[crowd shouting]

11:25.567 --> 11:26.600
YEAH!
[laughs]

11:28.733 --> 11:31.400
- WHOA! HEY!

11:31.400 --> 11:32.500
- LET'S TALK IT OUT!

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
- ANOTHER SANDWICH?

11:33.500 --> 11:36.567
[crowd shouting frantically]

11:36.567 --> 11:39.500
[chainsaw buzzing]

11:42.500 --> 11:44.267
all: AND DON'T COME BACK!

11:46.067 --> 11:47.700
- REALLY? THE CHAINSAW?

11:47.700 --> 11:49.600
- IT DOESN'T HAVE A CHAIN ON IT.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.533
[all cheering]

11:55.700 --> 11:57.233
- DARN IT!

11:57.233 --> 12:02.067
DARN IT! DARN IT! DARN IT!
DARN IT! DARN IT! DARN IT!

12:02.067 --> 12:05.300
- OKAY, I CAN PROBABLY GET THEM
THE ICE CREAM SUNDAE BAR,

12:05.300 --> 12:07.333
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO GET THEM

12:07.333 --> 12:08.567
BRUNCH WITH WAYNE GRETZKY.

12:08.567 --> 12:11.333
- THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANYTHING!

12:11.333 --> 12:13.900
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS STRIKE

12:13.900 --> 12:17.167
AND GET GRIFFIN HIS SONG
BY TOMORROW.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.267
- HOW?

12:18.267 --> 12:19.333
- YOU'LL SEE.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.200
AND IT'S GOING TO BE SHOCKING.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
[electricity zaps]

12:23.200 --> 12:24.967
[screams]

12:27.067 --> 12:28.600
- SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.300
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.500
GUSTAVO STARTS SWEATING.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.133
"OH, I'M GUSTAVO,
AND I'M SWEATING, DOGS."

12:36.133 --> 12:37.800
- THEN GRIFFIN CALLS.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.833
"HELLO, GUSTAVO,
I'M WEIRD AND RICH,

12:39.833 --> 12:41.233
AND WHERE'S MY NEW SONG?"

12:41.233 --> 12:45.167
- AND THEN GUSTAVO CALLS US UP,
GIVES IN TO ALL OUR DEMANDS,

12:45.167 --> 12:46.533
AND STRIKE OVER.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.067
- STRIKE OVER!

12:48.067 --> 12:49.267
- [laughs]

12:49.267 --> 12:53.200
NOW, ALL WE NEED ARE SANDWICHES
THAT ARE TASTY...

12:53.200 --> 12:57.067
AND NOT TERRIFYING.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.600
- HEY, I MADE THOSE SANDWICHES.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.567
- AND DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.367
- OKAY, MOM IS ON STRIKE TOO,
AND, FRANKLY,

13:03.367 --> 13:04.767
SHE IS OVERREACTING

13:04.767 --> 13:07.067
AND OVERSTATING
HER JOB DESCRIPTION.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.533
- WELL, FRANKLY,
MAMA MAKES A GREAT SAMMICH.

13:09.533 --> 13:13.233
NOW GO BACK TO THE PALMWOODS,
JUST ADMIT THAT YOU'RE WRONG,

13:13.233 --> 13:15.233
AND HAVE HER WHIP UP
FOUR TURKEY AND CHEESE

13:15.233 --> 13:16.233
WITH LETTUCE AND MAYO?

13:16.233 --> 13:17.233
- YEP.
- YEAH.

13:17.233 --> 13:18.267
- YEAH.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.067
- OOH, AND GRAB
MY NEW WHITE JACKET.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.333
IT'S, UH--IT'S CHILLY.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.333
- FINE.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.933
[cell phone ringing]

13:25.933 --> 13:27.167
- IT'S GUSTAVO.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.600
PROBABLY WANTS TO TALK.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.700
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
IS MISSING HIS MUG.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.600
- REALLY?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.867
- [sighs]
MOM, I'M SORRY.

13:39.867 --> 13:42.067
AND WHAT WILL IT TAKE
TO GET YOU TO STOP STRIKING?

13:44.067 --> 13:46.200
- I WILL STOP WHEN YOU ADMIT
THAT A MOM'S JOB

13:46.200 --> 13:48.733
IS JUST AS HARD
AS ANY OTHER JOB IN THE WORLD.

13:48.733 --> 13:51.333
- YOUR JOB IS JUST AS HARD
AS ANY OTHER JOB IN THE WORLD.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.667
NOW, WILL YOU
MAKE FOUR SANDWICHES

13:52.667 --> 13:54.700
AND DO A QUICK WASH
ON JAMES' JACKET?

13:54.700 --> 13:56.500
HE'S COLD.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.900
- YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU?

13:58.900 --> 14:00.900
- MOM, I WANT TO STRESS TO YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU,

14:00.900 --> 14:03.167
BUT WHAT YOU DO
IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

14:03.167 --> 14:04.167
- OH, REALLY?

14:04.167 --> 14:05.333
- YEAH.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.767
- THEN YOU WASH
THE BOYS' CLOTHES.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.067
OH, AND DON'T FORGET TO SEPARATE
THE WHITES FROM THE COLORS

14:09.067 --> 14:10.067
AND THE BRIGHT COLORS.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.400
WASH THE COLORS ON HEAVY SOIL.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.067
BLEACH THE WHITES
ON HOT-COLD HOT,

14:13.067 --> 14:15.067
DO EVERYTHING ELSE
ON COLD-COLD COLD.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.700
OH, EXCEPT FOR JAMES' DELICATES,
THOSE REQUIRE PERMANENT PRESS.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.500
AND ADD STEAM FOR COTTONS,
NO STEAM FOR POLY-COTTON BLENDS.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.733
AND DO NOT WASH ANYTHING RED
WITH ANYTHING ELSE

14:22.733 --> 14:23.867
ON HOT-COLD HOT,

14:23.867 --> 14:27.800
OR THE ENTIRE LOAD
WILL COME OUT PINK.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.467
- ISN'T THERE
JUST A "CLEAN" BUTTON?

14:29.467 --> 14:30.900
- NO.

14:33.233 --> 14:37.133
- SO I ASSUME YOU'VE DECIDED
TO MEET ALL OF YOUR DEMANDS,

14:37.133 --> 14:38.433
AND WE ACCEPT.

14:38.433 --> 14:40.433
- CLOSE.

14:40.433 --> 14:41.800
YOU'RE FIRED!

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
all: WHAT?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.100
- WHAT?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.667
- YOU CAN'T FIRE US.
WE'RE BIG TIME RUSH.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.900
- YEAH, AND YOU CAN'T MAKE
A SECOND BIG TIME RUSH ALBUM

14:47.900 --> 14:49.733
WITHOUT BIG TIME RUSH.

14:49.733 --> 14:54.067
- WRONG,
BECAUSE I AM BIG TIME RUSH.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.900
I OWN ALL THE SONGS.
I OWN THE STUDIO.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.533
I OWN YOUR LIKENESSES,

14:58.533 --> 15:01.967
AND I CAN MAKE THE ALBUM
WITHOUT YOU.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.333
YOU LOSE. I WIN.
STRIKE OVER.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.600
- UH...

15:05.600 --> 15:07.500
CARLOS, TIME TO FLEX
A LITTLE BIG-TIME MUSCLE.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.800
- YES.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.067
- CHECK IT.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.967
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET YOUR MUG BACK.

15:11.967 --> 15:13.400
both: OH!

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
- I DON'T NEED IT.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.900
I GOT A NEW ONE.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.067
all: AW.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.667
- GUSTAVO,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

15:19.667 --> 15:20.667
- NO.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.067
THE TIME FOR TALK IS OVER.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.567
YOU GOT GREEDY.

15:23.567 --> 15:28.067
YOU PUSHED ME,
AND NOW YOU GOT FIRED.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.133
- YEAH?

15:29.133 --> 15:30.900
WELL, WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.700
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
- YEAH.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.267
- I THINK WE SHOULD TRY
SETTING FIVE.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.533
[electrical hum]

15:36.533 --> 15:38.867
- OH, NO.

15:38.867 --> 15:40.433
[electricity zaps]

15:40.433 --> 15:41.867
- I DON'T LIKE--
[crackle]

15:41.867 --> 15:43.100
ZZ-ZZ-SETTING NUMBER FIVE.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.733
- I CAN'T BELIEVE GU--
ZZ-STAVO BEAT US

15:44.733 --> 15:45.933
WHEN WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.367
- AND NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SING

15:47.367 --> 15:49.100
ON OUR SECOND ALBUM!

15:51.600 --> 15:52.767
[record scratches]

15:52.767 --> 15:55.367
- OH, NOW YOU GET ALL MUSCLEY--
EE-EE?

15:55.367 --> 15:57.900
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.133
- WE ARE NOT BEATEN YET,

16:00.133 --> 16:03.233
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING
THAT GUSTAVO DOESN'T.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.467
- HAIR.

16:04.467 --> 16:05.467
- A SOUL.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.900
- HIS COFFEE MUG.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.133
- OUR FANS,

16:09.133 --> 16:12.667
AND THEY WANT US,
NOT...

16:12.667 --> 16:14.467
NOT US.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.267
all: I SMELL PLAN.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.833
- WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A VIDEO,
UPLOAD IT TO THE WEB,

16:19.833 --> 16:22.400
OUR FANS ARE GOING TO SEE IT,
RISE UP,

16:22.400 --> 16:25.267
AND GUSTAVO WILL COME CRAWLING
BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.733
- A VIDEO? HOW ARE WE
GOING TO MAKE A VIDEO?

16:27.733 --> 16:29.067
GUSTAVO OWNS THE NAME
OF THE BAND

16:29.067 --> 16:32.400
AND ALL OF OUR
PERFORMANCE CLOTHES.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.533
- WE CAN USE OUR OWN CLOTHES.

16:34.833 --> 16:38.300
- YEAH, ABOUT THE CLOTHES...

16:38.300 --> 16:40.233
- AH, ONE MORE SMALL PROBLEM.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.667
GUSTAVO ALSO OWNS
EVERY BIG TIME RUSH SONG.

16:43.667 --> 16:47.633
- NOT EVERY SONG.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.200
- * OH, YOU'RE SUCH A TURD *

16:49.200 --> 16:51.233
* OH, YEAH,
A GIANT TURD *

16:51.233 --> 16:52.833
* AND YOU LOOK LIKE A TURD

16:52.833 --> 16:54.933
* AND YOU SMELL LIKE A TURD

16:54.933 --> 16:56.700
* OH, YOU'RE SUCH A TURD *

16:56.700 --> 16:58.767
* OH, YEAH,
A GIANT TURD *

16:58.767 --> 17:00.500
* AND YOU LOOK LIKE A TURD

17:00.500 --> 17:02.500
* AND YOU SMELL

17:02.500 --> 17:05.067
- * LIKE A TU-URD

17:05.067 --> 17:06.367
- HA.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.800
- YEAH,
WE CANNOT POST THIS VIDEO.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.867
- UGH!
