01:18.655 --> 01:20.656
Where's Daddy?

01:21.524 --> 01:23.527
I love it.

01:23.627 --> 01:27.562
Are we going to the mountains tomorrow,
Daddy? Are we? Are we? Are we?

01:33.270 --> 01:34.505
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:34.605 --> 01:36.706
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.976
Oh, my God!

02:12.076 --> 02:13.978
I always do it.

02:14.078 --> 02:15.479
What?

02:15.579 --> 02:17.312
What?

02:37.066 --> 02:38.903
Yeah!

02:41.338 --> 02:43.926
That was awesome. Alright, my turn.

02:46.176 --> 02:48.210
This is fun.

02:50.146 --> 02:53.348
- Are you okay, Daddy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:07.430 --> 03:09.200
- Freddie, watch it.
- Oh, God!

03:09.300 --> 03:11.302
- Oh, shit!
- Freddie!

03:11.402 --> 03:13.205
Oh, my God!

03:13.305 --> 03:14.703
Shit!

03:15.471 --> 03:17.506
That was kind of fun.

03:19.309 --> 03:23.178
Hi. I'm looking for Wall. For Otto Wall.

03:23.813 --> 03:25.647
Okay.

03:29.452 --> 03:32.856
I... I never should've let
Freddie drive so fast.

03:32.956 --> 03:35.859
That was so... so dumb of me.

03:40.164 --> 03:42.228
What are you thinking?

03:45.134 --> 03:47.336
What are you thinking?

03:51.007 --> 03:53.511
- What if you lose your foot?
- My foot?

03:53.611 --> 03:59.083
- The doctor said that there was a chance.
- No. No way. No chance.

03:59.383 --> 04:02.250
Why did you have to do this now?

04:02.786 --> 04:04.661
Hey, come here.

04:04.761 --> 04:07.792
- What are we gonna do?
- Come here.

04:08.192 --> 04:10.344
- Come here. Listen.
- Otto...

04:10.444 --> 04:13.212
Come over here. Come over here.

04:14.514 --> 04:16.791
Listen, I'm telling you...

04:16.891 --> 04:20.086
we're gonna get through this. Okay?

04:20.185 --> 04:22.189
We're gonna be just fine.

04:22.289 --> 04:26.391
This is nothing.
It's a nick, it's a scratch.

04:27.093 --> 04:29.128
We'll be fine.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.532
Come here. Give me a hug.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.268
You don't believe me?

04:42.642 --> 04:45.751
Mama, why did this happen to Daddy?

04:45.851 --> 04:49.182
Why do these things
always happen to Daddy?

04:50.751 --> 04:53.285
He doesn't pay attention.

04:56.457 --> 04:58.524
Hey!

05:00.426 --> 05:03.155
What are we going to do with you?

05:20.179 --> 05:22.917
- Ginny.
- <i>You saw the caller I.D.</i>

05:23.017 --> 05:24.919
<i>It's Ginny Summerson.</i>

05:25.019 --> 05:28.422
<i>Your senior counselor
from Camp Mishancominga.</i>

05:28.522 --> 05:30.224
- <i>How are you?</i>
- Goo...

05:30.324 --> 05:31.629
<i>And guess what?</i>

05:31.729 --> 05:37.654
<i>Liz, Collie and I are organizing
a 20th anniversary camp reunion.</i>

05:38.465 --> 05:40.367
- Great.
- <i>Isn't that great?</i>

05:40.467 --> 05:44.539
<i>And Russell and Randall Kendriff
will come. And Lara Cuff.</i>

05:45.039 --> 05:47.874
Lara Cuff.

05:47.974 --> 05:49.743
<i>I thought that would get you.</i>

05:49.843 --> 05:53.967
<i>Now, Otto, I'm gonna send you
the e-vite and you come, okay? Bye.</i>

05:54.067 --> 05:56.381
Goodbye. Bye.

05:57.216 --> 06:00.206
- I wanna pray for Daddy.
- Pray?

06:00.306 --> 06:03.355
Yes. I want God to be nice to him.

06:34.288 --> 06:35.320
Hi.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.434
<i>I need you to come
to my therapist this afternoon...</i>

06:38.534 --> 06:42.129
<i>at 3 o'clock. Can you make it?</i>

06:43.729 --> 06:46.098
You have a therapist?

06:47.133 --> 06:49.707
So... Otto.

06:49.807 --> 06:52.940
How is your foot?
Are you comfortable there?

06:53.040 --> 06:56.677
Oh, yes, thanks. It's fine. Thank you.

06:56.777 --> 07:01.148
Yes. Annie thinks
that you're almost healed.

07:01.248 --> 07:04.985
I'm so glad you've been...
had quite a time of it, haven't you?

07:05.085 --> 07:07.788
Oh, it's, you know...
it's not such a big deal.

07:07.888 --> 07:10.327
Well, you're lucky in a way.

07:10.427 --> 07:12.693
Oh, I know. I am.

07:12.793 --> 07:14.095
Yes.

07:14.795 --> 07:19.032
It's nice to put a face
to your name finally.

07:21.034 --> 07:22.435
Thanks.

07:38.985 --> 07:40.619
I...

07:43.656 --> 07:46.126
I need to...

07:46.226 --> 07:48.308
I think...

07:58.704 --> 08:00.772
I'm sorry.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.643
It's alright.

08:06.512 --> 08:09.026
Your marriage is over.

08:09.216 --> 08:13.219
- Excuse me.
- Your marriage, it's over.

08:15.087 --> 08:16.890
No. What?

08:16.990 --> 08:22.185
And Annie would like for you to get
your own place as soon as possible.

08:22.762 --> 08:24.031
What?

08:24.131 --> 08:28.603
And arrangements will be made,
of course for your daughter.

08:29.703 --> 08:33.607
Responsibilities that have
to be shared. You both work.

08:33.707 --> 08:36.677
So Annie needs for you to be flexible...

08:36.777 --> 08:39.711
Annie, Annie, what is this?

08:41.414 --> 08:43.549
I have a lawyer.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.252
Gus Menzies.

08:45.552 --> 08:47.721
- The guy from TV?
- I know Gus.

08:47.821 --> 08:50.709
- The "Gotta Call Gus" guy?
- He's very good.

08:50.809 --> 08:53.627
Wait a minute. Wait. You have a lawyer?

08:53.727 --> 08:57.631
Hold on. Annie, are you serious?

08:57.731 --> 09:00.380
I mean, this is... this is crazy.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.884
- It's always hard to hear.
- Don't you think that we should discuss this?

09:03.984 --> 09:09.321
- No, no, it's not open to discussion.
- No. I want you to leave.

09:10.123 --> 09:12.426
Why? What's happened?

09:12.626 --> 09:14.730
It's better for everybody.

09:16.530 --> 09:18.779
Why? I mean, don't you think
we should try

09:18.879 --> 09:23.270
and find someone to talk to
about this or some kind of...

09:23.370 --> 09:26.039
I mean, we could get counseling.
I mean, if you really want to...

09:26.139 --> 09:29.009
- I don't want to.
- ...if you're serious.

09:29.109 --> 09:31.111
I don't understand.

09:31.211 --> 09:33.948
Are you that unhappy?

09:34.548 --> 09:37.451
You know, we don't need
to get into that right now.

09:37.551 --> 09:39.853
Now is not the time.

09:39.953 --> 09:41.688
Now is not the time?

09:41.788 --> 09:46.760
You know this session really is just
to notify you of Annie's intention.

09:46.860 --> 09:50.111
Will you please... please.

09:50.630 --> 09:53.500
Why are you unhappy? Is it something...

09:53.600 --> 09:55.285
- What am I not doing?
- Otto.

09:55.385 --> 09:58.986
What happened? How did I not know?
Is it because of my accident?

09:59.086 --> 10:00.440
- No, it's not. It isn't.
- No.

10:00.540 --> 10:03.677
Because I know it was stupid
and it's all my fault

10:03.777 --> 10:05.612
but I'm gonna be up completely soon.

10:05.712 --> 10:08.332
I really am. And I'll be able
to help out more with Ede.

10:08.432 --> 10:10.451
- Otto. Otto.
- And at home, I'll be...

10:10.551 --> 10:12.886
Otto, honey, this... it's...

10:12.986 --> 10:14.989
It's over.

10:15.389 --> 10:18.370
Will you stop it, please. Just...

10:19.992 --> 10:22.062
God damn it.

10:22.162 --> 10:25.236
Please tell me why you would do this?
Like this?

10:25.336 --> 10:29.718
Just blind side me like this
without any warning or anything?

10:29.818 --> 10:33.240
- It just seems crazy.
- It's hard to take in, you know.

10:33.340 --> 10:36.652
- It's trauma. Trauma is...
- Will you shut the fuck up.

10:36.752 --> 10:40.347
- You know, you need to...
- You gotta shut the fuck up.

10:40.447 --> 10:43.148
Okay? I don't wanna do this.

10:43.916 --> 10:45.350
I do.

10:49.422 --> 10:52.776
- We don't even fight.
- I know. Exactly.

10:54.527 --> 10:56.428
Can you...

10:59.799 --> 11:01.834
What about Ede?

11:04.770 --> 11:07.038
She'll be fine.

11:07.607 --> 11:11.711
She knows.
She knows something isn't right.

11:12.278 --> 11:14.612
And she's resilient.

11:21.254 --> 11:23.121
Thank you.

11:39.705 --> 11:41.942
- And she won't...
- No, no. It's over.

11:42.042 --> 11:44.745
Done. Case closed. Bam.

11:44.845 --> 11:49.016
They filed electronically, so you
couldn't stop even if you wanted too.

11:49.116 --> 11:51.349
A fait accompli.

11:51.851 --> 11:54.021
I don't understand.

11:56.021 --> 11:58.559
Fait accompli.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.861
That means it's over.

12:00.961 --> 12:03.630
I mean, apparently she's been
working on that for a while.

12:03.730 --> 12:07.668
Gosh, what... what happened?
I mean, you didn't...

12:07.768 --> 12:11.369
You didn't try to murder her
or something, did ya?

12:12.506 --> 12:15.476
We were fine. And I thought I...

12:15.576 --> 12:20.596
Maybe 3 years ago, there was some
suggestion of going to counseling,

12:20.696 --> 12:24.617
but I don't even remember
what became of that.

12:26.886 --> 12:31.156
- I can't do anything?
- Well, you can move on.

12:32.124 --> 12:36.218
Listen, I can't... Well, again,
I can't tell you how sorry I am,

12:36.518 --> 12:40.167
but we'll see things are fair and square,
you know, property wise.

12:40.267 --> 12:45.105
Now... I need your e-sig...
Oh, gee-whiz.

12:45.205 --> 12:48.364
I need your e-signature on this thing.

12:48.975 --> 12:52.088
So this is the last one
that I thought of.

12:54.548 --> 12:57.150
Maybe this will suit
what you're looking for.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.985
Did I mention wantin' a large backyard?

13:36.088 --> 13:39.491
- Annie...
- You could've gotten someone to help you.

13:39.925 --> 13:42.729
- You could...
- What time does Ede get dropped?

13:42.829 --> 13:47.299
I can do it in time. It just took longer
with, you know, one foot and I...

14:00.879 --> 14:02.349
- Ede.
- Ede.

14:02.449 --> 14:04.983
I'm fine. Leave me alone.

14:28.207 --> 14:31.443
Ede, hi. What are you doin'?

14:32.812 --> 14:35.146
That sounds cool.

14:46.225 --> 14:48.228
Fabulous!

14:48.795 --> 14:50.196
Yeah.

14:50.296 --> 14:52.699
I didn't break it. I fell over...

14:52.799 --> 14:55.027
It's so hard to get it on.

15:04.276 --> 15:08.148
- No, it's supposed to be a skirt.
- Like right there, that would look better.

15:08.248 --> 15:12.252
No, I don't wanna wear this.
I don't wanna be the princess.

15:12.352 --> 15:15.288
I wanna be the queen, or the king.

15:19.592 --> 15:21.393
Ede?

15:21.961 --> 15:23.595
Hey...

15:24.663 --> 15:28.799
Ede, maybe I can pick you up after that
and you can come see what I have done...

15:28.899 --> 15:32.926
just for you. I think
you're gonna like...

15:33.106 --> 15:34.773
Okay.

15:36.175 --> 15:40.029
No, I can't do Wednesday.
Can you do Thursday?

15:42.348 --> 15:45.025
Tumblin'? You do tumblin'?

15:45.125 --> 15:47.856
Do you have any time open on Friday?

16:15.848 --> 16:19.284
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Don't do it. This is...

16:34.700 --> 16:37.435
Oh, divorced.

16:44.244 --> 16:48.518
Oh, my God, and Stephanie Giljames
you are still so hot!

17:43.168 --> 17:45.336
Oh, Lara.

18:05.958 --> 18:09.029
Look at this. Look. Did you see?

18:09.329 --> 18:12.366
And then look. And look at this.
Look at this thing!

18:12.766 --> 18:14.552
Do you think it's pretty?

18:17.369 --> 18:19.172
I love it.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.074
Come over here.

18:21.174 --> 18:23.841
Oh, my gosh!

18:28.314 --> 18:30.248
Ede?

18:30.616 --> 18:34.136
Garlic toast. Yeah?

18:39.892 --> 18:41.795
And then we started running
on the jungle gym

18:41.895 --> 18:44.414
and then we started going
on the top and going down.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.367
Then we were pretending that one
of the other clans was discovering us.

18:47.467 --> 18:49.469
We had to run and hide.

18:49.569 --> 18:53.373
'Cause it'll be dangerous if one
of the other clans discovered another clan.

18:53.473 --> 18:55.742
'Cause they'd kill 'em.

18:56.876 --> 19:01.648
And then, Lilly's mom gave us
fresh roadkill, which was muffins.

19:01.748 --> 19:03.783
- What's fresh... what?
- Fresh roadkill.

19:03.883 --> 19:06.186
She gave us what she said
was fresh roadkill.

19:06.286 --> 19:08.779
- Even though it was pumpkin muffins.
- Oh, she was joking?

19:08.879 --> 19:11.088
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.894
You're boiling over. Watch out!

19:20.466 --> 19:24.515
So anyway, Lilly has a big house,
so last Saturday I went over

19:24.615 --> 19:28.676
and she has a garden with cool, old stonewalls
and we played like it was a castle.

19:29.576 --> 19:33.246
Like it was a castle?
Have you seen my backyard?

19:33.346 --> 19:36.383
Have you seen how big it is?
Come on. Come on.

19:36.483 --> 19:39.284
I'll show you the backyard. Come on.

19:41.353 --> 19:42.367
Can we have a garden?

19:42.467 --> 19:47.464
I wanna make, like, a secret garden
with walls and gates and flowers.

19:47.964 --> 19:49.596
Walls? Okay.

19:49.696 --> 19:53.030
Like over here.
You can do that, couldn't you?

19:54.032 --> 19:56.563
And then maybe Lilly could come over.

19:58.141 --> 20:00.240
Sure. Yeah.

20:00.340 --> 20:04.311
Let's ask her for a date.
Or you know, play date.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.546
Yeah. Except, you know,
her mother doesn't know you.

20:09.148 --> 20:11.416
You'd have to make that okay.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.551
Absolutely.

20:13.652 --> 20:15.949
How do we do that?

20:18.207 --> 20:20.374
Goodnight, Edith.

20:21.193 --> 20:23.527
You shocked me.

20:23.897 --> 20:25.730
Sorry.

20:29.769 --> 20:32.338
Daddy, you're so funny. I love you.

20:32.438 --> 20:35.136
I love you too.

20:36.275 --> 20:40.713
And... I'm really sorry
this all had to happen.

20:40.913 --> 20:43.749
I know. Mama says now she can breathe.

20:45.717 --> 20:48.753
Can you breathe? Are you okay?

20:50.689 --> 20:52.114
I'm okay.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.641
- That's not work, is it?
- Oh, it's...

21:42.741 --> 21:46.680
Come on. I heard some news.
I wanna talk to you. Follow me.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.750
Is it the audit? Are you...
You're not firing people, are you?

21:50.850 --> 21:54.154
Don't tell me
that I'm gonna lose my job.

21:54.254 --> 21:55.892
You're getting divorced?

21:55.992 --> 21:58.724
How did you hear that?
I haven't even told anyone.

21:58.824 --> 22:01.528
That's horrible! Horrible!

22:01.628 --> 22:05.632
I bet you're just stunned, right? I mean...
listen, we don't have to talk about it.

22:05.732 --> 22:09.402
- I mean, I am your boss, it's private.
- Yeah. Well, I...

22:09.502 --> 22:13.073
Well, you just think of yourself
as the biggest loser ever, right?

22:13.173 --> 22:15.809
Well... I really don't know
what's happening.

22:15.909 --> 22:21.267
I just sort of... I just sort of muddle
through my days, you know. And I'm...

22:21.509 --> 22:24.063
I'm stunned like you said.

22:24.163 --> 22:27.019
Well, I don't wanna scare you too badly,
but divorce is hands down

22:27.119 --> 22:29.402
the worst thing I ever went
through my entire life.

22:29.502 --> 22:30.690
Really?

22:30.790 --> 22:33.559
'Cause no matter how horrible
the marriage was...

22:33.659 --> 22:35.352
I don't even think it was that bad.

22:35.452 --> 22:38.711
Well, you know what? It's not as bad
as what's ahead of you because at one time

22:38.811 --> 22:42.649
you thought there was love there, right?
In your life? Well, you were wrong.

22:42.749 --> 22:44.220
Listen to me, okay?

22:44.320 --> 22:47.540
It's been 5 years, and I still don't have
a clue why it all went wrong, really.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.943
I mean, you're never going
to really understand.

22:50.043 --> 22:54.080
- How did you get through it?
- Otto, I was suicidal for like a year.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.167
And I didn't even know it.
I was just drifting along, right?

22:57.267 --> 23:00.530
- Took me forever to find a reason to live.
- And what was it?

23:00.630 --> 23:04.757
I'm just so sorry for you.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

23:04.857 --> 23:07.427
- Tell me you'll be okay.
- I'll be okay.

23:07.527 --> 23:09.634
- Yeah? You're gonna be alright?
- Yeah. Sure.

23:09.734 --> 23:12.332
Oh, God! It's awful.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.901
Thanks for your concern, Holly.

23:15.001 --> 23:18.438
- I've got 8 cats.
- Okay.

23:18.838 --> 23:21.072
I shouldn't have brought it up.

24:19.798 --> 24:21.532
Shazam!

25:02.240 --> 25:04.242
Dick Conner!

25:11.884 --> 25:15.254
Annie! Annie! Fuck!

25:15.354 --> 25:17.878
Fuck!

25:19.524 --> 25:21.193
Shit!

25:21.293 --> 25:23.027
Shit!

25:42.480 --> 25:47.085
If this hematoma doesn't go down we might
have to go back in and change the bolts.

25:48.053 --> 25:49.656
Okay?

25:50.156 --> 25:51.891
Go back in?

25:51.991 --> 25:56.714
And let me tell you this, you start feeling
a knobby hard place up here?

25:56.814 --> 25:59.797
And you find your toes
are turning purple?

26:00.398 --> 26:03.349
We will be chopping it off.

26:04.936 --> 26:06.704
The foot.

26:10.309 --> 26:12.912
- No?
- Oh, yeah.

26:13.012 --> 26:15.714
You know, I've set a goal of...

26:15.814 --> 26:19.575
- There's this 10K that I'd like to be ready for.
- You know, I'm trying to scare you.

26:19.675 --> 26:22.388
Oh, you're doing a good job.

26:22.688 --> 26:24.622
So be smart.

26:26.025 --> 26:29.429
- How are you doing otherwise?
- I'm great.

26:29.529 --> 26:32.465
How are your girls? Annie's running?

26:32.565 --> 26:34.388
We're separated.

26:35.100 --> 26:39.206
- Well, no wonder you're pushing.
- Yeah, I'm just trying to get healthy.

26:40.306 --> 26:43.308
I got... I got what you need.

26:43.408 --> 26:46.412
Generic Ativan.

26:46.512 --> 26:50.517
Just for when the blues come on.
Mellows things out.

26:51.117 --> 26:53.585
I pop 'em like candy.

26:53.985 --> 26:56.255
I'm kiddin'.

26:56.355 --> 26:57.813
But...

26:57.913 --> 27:00.615
we all need some way
to get through the night.

27:03.195 --> 27:06.546
Try and find some other activity
that keeps you off your feet.

27:06.646 --> 27:09.040
- Okay.
- Know what I mean?

27:09.140 --> 27:11.248
- Alright.
- Yeah.

27:13.184 --> 27:15.486
Keep using the cane.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.548
"Fee time.
What's your favorite restaurant?"

27:52.524 --> 27:54.725
Oh, my God. Otto!

27:55.674 --> 28:00.199
I gotta go. Have the Hammersmark transferred
to Chicago and don't bother me with it.

28:00.299 --> 28:04.338
- Oh, my God! You look fantastic.
- Hi! Thank you.

28:06.606 --> 28:08.874
- I'm always early.
- Good.

28:08.974 --> 28:12.643
You're so hot! You're handsome!

28:13.179 --> 28:16.702
You're smokin'!
Do you not hear that all the time?

28:16.802 --> 28:20.920
- No. I'm married. Or...
- Okay.

28:21.020 --> 28:24.622
- Sit down. I got this Pinot Gris.
- Okay.

28:27.859 --> 28:32.617
And you're, like, still so beautiful.

28:34.332 --> 28:37.261
You still talk so softly.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.539
I was so thrilled to find you again.

28:39.639 --> 28:43.669
I mean, how long has it been
since we dated? Like, 15 years?

28:43.769 --> 28:45.678
More actually.

28:45.778 --> 28:48.114
- Jesus!
- It's alright.

28:48.214 --> 28:49.682
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

28:49.782 --> 28:52.645
- Life?
- Just not myself.

28:55.352 --> 28:59.290
Yeah. I saw on the... I saw on the...

29:00.024 --> 29:02.747
You've got big sons. I just...

29:02.847 --> 29:06.933
Can you believe it? I mean,
they're both at McCallie Prep.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.202
And... you've a little girl.

29:09.802 --> 29:11.695
I do.

29:11.795 --> 29:14.977
Ede. She's 9. She's great.

29:15.307 --> 29:19.245
- Who did you marry, Otto Wall?
- Annie. Mick Williams.

29:19.545 --> 29:21.681
I don't think you know her.

29:23.109 --> 29:26.050
And... and we're not together.

29:30.889 --> 29:32.390
Is she beautiful?

29:35.478 --> 29:37.712
Yeah. Yeah.

29:39.964 --> 29:42.902
- My sons are gonna be studs.
- No kidding. Come on.

29:43.002 --> 29:45.471
Grayson was a stud.
You never met Grayson, did you?

29:45.571 --> 29:48.842
- No, I don't think so. Not face to face.
- He was a fucking asshole!

29:48.942 --> 29:52.712
He cheated on me four times.
I mean, how stupid am I?

29:52.812 --> 29:54.847
What about you?

29:55.790 --> 29:58.637
No. You know, no I... No cheating.

29:58.737 --> 30:01.854
Are you recent? We divorced last fall.

30:01.954 --> 30:04.590
Well, we're...

30:04.890 --> 30:07.060
We're not actually divorced yet.

30:10.761 --> 30:13.911
I've never said that word before.

30:14.011 --> 30:18.137
Get used to it.
It's a fucking great word.

30:18.897 --> 30:23.409
It's a great place to be.
No fucking strings!

30:23.509 --> 30:26.376
I have never had so much fun.

30:28.614 --> 30:33.170
I should tell you straight out, I'm not
around a lot. In and out. No strings.

30:34.220 --> 30:38.557
- Thank you for driving up from Charlotte.
- No problem.

30:38.657 --> 30:41.160
I think this wine's too fruity.

30:41.260 --> 30:43.928
Let me order something else?
Do you want something, or...

30:45.163 --> 30:46.898
What do you want?

31:08.286 --> 31:10.089
Don't get up.

31:10.189 --> 31:12.458
I like to be at my desk by 8.

31:12.558 --> 31:14.827
If I go 90 on the freeway, I'll make it.

31:14.927 --> 31:17.263
I have a power bar in the car.

31:17.863 --> 31:20.599
It was so fun to see you, Otto.

31:20.699 --> 31:23.936
You should think about
boarding school for your kid.

31:24.036 --> 31:27.872
Stay in touch when you can, alright?
It's so easy now.

31:34.946 --> 31:36.981
Don't get up, okay?

31:40.719 --> 31:45.891
- You are shitting me.
- We had a really hot time.

31:46.081 --> 31:49.373
This is an old girlfriend
who found you on Facebook?

31:51.396 --> 31:56.501
Women. You know, it's...
it's kind of exciting.

31:56.601 --> 31:59.879
It's like a new world.
I mean, I don't...

31:59.979 --> 32:04.209
I don't know if it'll even ever happen again
but I think it was just maybe 'cause...

32:04.309 --> 32:08.547
- I'm available?
- <i>This isn't dating. Ladies have needs.</i>

32:08.647 --> 32:10.377
Daddy?

32:10.477 --> 32:13.903
- Yeah.
- I wanna go to church.

32:14.719 --> 32:15.854
What?

32:16.154 --> 32:19.556
What? Otto? You there?

32:34.038 --> 32:35.775
Otto.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.643
Otto!

32:39.444 --> 32:41.111
Shit.

32:44.580 --> 32:47.086
What was that the other night?

32:47.736 --> 32:49.588
Last week.

32:49.688 --> 32:53.980
That cursing, that message you left?
What was that?

32:54.659 --> 32:56.462
I had... I had just...

32:56.562 --> 33:00.065
And I've just been so pleased
with how civil this has all been.

33:00.165 --> 33:04.203
So maybe just don't...

33:04.903 --> 33:07.106
- do it again, okay?
- Shit.

33:07.206 --> 33:10.409
You know what, maybe
we can work something out?

33:10.509 --> 33:14.645
So we aren't both here
at the same time too?

33:14.879 --> 33:17.183
'Cause you know, this is...

33:17.283 --> 33:19.151
this is my time.

33:19.551 --> 33:21.353
This is your time?

33:21.453 --> 33:24.138
Ede has tae Kwon do. I have 50 minutes.

33:24.723 --> 33:26.958
You know that, Otto.

33:30.562 --> 33:35.567
I know this is hard for you
and I'm sorry about that.

33:35.967 --> 33:38.826
Do you think Ede's fine with this?

33:39.605 --> 33:41.507
It's all for the good.

33:41.807 --> 33:44.641
- All for the good?
- Listen...

33:44.991 --> 33:48.567
It's nobody's fault.
It's both of our fault.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.754
That's... the way life is.

33:51.917 --> 33:55.557
No. Not always.

33:56.287 --> 33:58.857
Annie, you and I... Hey.

33:58.957 --> 34:01.593
You and I, we have got to just...

34:01.693 --> 34:05.597
Really? Doing this here?
That's really fair.

34:05.897 --> 34:07.589
Fair? I...

34:07.689 --> 34:10.119
I'm only gonna get,
like, 20 minutes to swim now.

34:10.268 --> 34:13.739
Well, I can pick Ede up
after tae Kwon do

34:13.839 --> 34:16.708
and then I can bring
her over to you later.

34:16.809 --> 34:19.612
- No, because we have an arrangement.
- Annie, I wanna...

34:19.712 --> 34:23.315
If you wanna communicate with me
do it through your lawyer.

34:23.415 --> 34:27.701
- That's what we're supposed to do.
- Wait. Just wait.

34:28.152 --> 34:32.091
Let's just get on with things.
Okay? Because...

34:32.190 --> 34:35.676
I am. I have.

34:37.428 --> 34:42.221
- Goodbye, Otto.
- Just... God damn it!

35:17.135 --> 35:18.738
Okay.

35:19.338 --> 35:21.040
Let me think.

35:21.140 --> 35:25.842
I liked the picture of you
in your kayak.

35:28.111 --> 35:29.848
I liked your name.

35:29.948 --> 35:32.471
Oh, God! Mildred?

35:32.571 --> 35:37.922
Yeah. Are you kidding me?
It's old fashioned and cool.

35:39.524 --> 35:42.895
Good. Then what about me?

35:43.695 --> 35:47.543
Well, I like your face.

35:47.733 --> 35:52.168
And your, really,
your beautiful breasts.

35:52.704 --> 35:56.239
And your... booty.

35:59.878 --> 36:02.114
You like my sweet little cooty cat?

36:03.449 --> 36:05.207
I...

36:05.307 --> 36:09.928
'Cause I like your cock in my pussy.
That's what I think is sexy.

36:12.224 --> 36:14.894
I like your hands on my flesh.

36:15.394 --> 36:18.670
I like that you have calluses
on the palms of your hands.

36:19.698 --> 36:23.136
So that it's rough when you touch
the inside of my thighs.

36:24.036 --> 36:25.338
What's your last name?

36:26.238 --> 36:28.240
- Wall.
- What?

36:28.340 --> 36:31.404
- Wall.
- Wall.

36:31.504 --> 36:33.612
That's kind of funny.

36:34.012 --> 36:35.814
It's Anglo-Saxon.

36:36.554 --> 36:38.468
Yeah. Of course.

36:42.588 --> 36:46.091
Mildred... are you...

36:46.191 --> 36:47.759
wet?

36:47.859 --> 36:50.480
Do me right, Mr. Wall.

36:50.862 --> 36:55.446
And then pull out really slowly
until I scream.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.286
Can you do that?

36:58.136 --> 37:00.472
Can you do that for me?

37:00.572 --> 37:03.392
Well, I can give it a shot?

37:05.143 --> 37:08.958
Can I kiss your little... cooty cat?

37:09.758 --> 37:11.516
- And...
- Yeah.

37:11.616 --> 37:14.453
Blow softly on it?

37:14.553 --> 37:18.755
And maybe just, like, flick it?

37:19.158 --> 37:23.428
And... and have my rough...

37:23.528 --> 37:27.032
- have my calluses...
- Yeah, your calluses.

37:27.132 --> 37:30.370
- ...on your nipples?
- Yeah. Lightly.

37:31.170 --> 37:34.373
Mildred, I wanna turn you over...

37:35.841 --> 37:38.677
And I wanna kiss you...

37:38.777 --> 37:40.979
and your breasts...

37:41.079 --> 37:43.015
and then that place...

37:43.115 --> 37:46.286
where your neck
and your shoulder meet...

37:48.120 --> 37:51.790
- Clavicle?
- Yes. Clavicle.

37:52.090 --> 37:55.992
Yeah. Kiss my clavicle.

37:57.695 --> 37:59.632
Oh, God.

38:00.232 --> 38:02.699
Oh, it's so good.

38:07.461 --> 38:09.172
God.

38:10.642 --> 38:12.525
Oh, God.

38:19.450 --> 38:21.720
Oh, God.

38:21.820 --> 38:24.354
Oh, God.

38:29.561 --> 38:31.729
Fuck.

38:31.829 --> 38:33.732
That was good.

38:33.832 --> 38:35.866
That was amazing.

38:37.468 --> 38:39.204
Thank you.

38:39.304 --> 38:42.305
Oh, the pleasure was mine.

38:56.887 --> 39:01.460
Believe me, I don't like to have to call you
either but you don't answer my emails.

39:02.093 --> 39:03.962
All I do is chauffeur her around.

39:04.062 --> 39:06.064
You know we need time
to do things together.

39:06.164 --> 39:10.798
And I know she wants to
because she texted me.

39:11.670 --> 39:14.307
I can take her this weekend.

39:15.207 --> 39:19.603
Well, can't she... can't she spend
the night at Molly's another time?

39:20.579 --> 39:25.083
Can we make this work?
I can pick her up at 3.

39:25.683 --> 39:27.319
- You wanna try it again?
- Yeah.

39:27.419 --> 39:29.380
Come here. Let me see that.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.176
You moved your snot to your cheek.

39:32.424 --> 39:37.100
You can't... comes out of your nose,
you gotta flick it off out of the pool.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.011
That's what the pros do.

39:39.797 --> 39:42.821
Daddy, you lost your screw-in tooth.

39:43.234 --> 39:46.236
It was permanent I thought.

39:47.538 --> 39:50.041
Oh, my gosh!

39:51.234 --> 39:53.316
Come on, let's see if we can find it.

40:05.356 --> 40:07.091
Thank you very much.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.594
What did he say?

40:09.694 --> 40:13.198
He said I've got an appointment
for next Wednesday.

40:13.298 --> 40:16.001
And that these things happen.

40:16.601 --> 40:18.736
Yeah. They do.

40:32.283 --> 40:34.106
- Hello.
- Hey, there.

40:34.206 --> 40:36.588
- Hi, I'm Ede.
- Hello, Ede.

40:36.688 --> 40:40.325
- Have y'all been to our church before?
- No, but my Daddy needs it.

40:40.425 --> 40:44.129
Well... we are all glad
that you're here today.

40:44.229 --> 40:47.199
- Miss Ede.
- Miz Ede. Thanks.

40:47.299 --> 40:51.570
We hope y'all keep comin'.
We all need to find what sustains us.

40:51.670 --> 40:53.129
Thank you.

41:08.284 --> 41:12.123
Such a nice guy
and then bam he hurts himself.

41:20.464 --> 41:23.201
Good singing though.
Did you like the singing?

41:25.102 --> 41:26.905
What the...

41:27.005 --> 41:29.339
What is it? What happened?

41:32.443 --> 41:35.013
I think we've been robbed.

41:35.113 --> 41:38.503
Oh, shit. They took my old CD player.

41:38.603 --> 41:40.919
- Who did?
- No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

41:41.019 --> 41:45.185
Don't step on the glass. Just stand back,
Ede. Don't touch anything, honey.

41:46.223 --> 41:48.358
Just hold on.

41:51.896 --> 41:54.576
We're gonna call the police
right now, okay?

41:55.866 --> 41:59.136
Shit. Just stand still. It's okay.

42:01.672 --> 42:04.808
You can go. I'm fine.

42:09.947 --> 42:11.781
Sorry.

42:24.828 --> 42:27.864
Why do you look so familiar?

42:40.962 --> 42:45.599
Daddy, have you double checked
all the doors and windows like I asked?

42:48.118 --> 42:49.888
You are a nurse.

42:49.988 --> 42:53.982
I'm the night supervisor at Heritage
Village retirement community.

42:54.082 --> 42:57.077
- I hear that's nice.
- It is.

43:00.398 --> 43:03.601
Where's your daughter this weekend?
Is she with your soon-to-be ex-wife?

43:03.701 --> 43:07.439
- Yeah. Yeah.
- She's really, really cute.

43:07.539 --> 43:09.574
- Yes.
- What does she like to do?

43:09.674 --> 43:13.290
She's actually really excited right now
because I'm building a stonewall

43:13.390 --> 43:15.747
around this garden that she's planned.

43:15.847 --> 43:20.217
Although I don't know
if I'll ever finish it, but...

43:22.053 --> 43:24.122
- This is really great.
- Do you think so?

43:24.222 --> 43:26.725
Yeah, I do. That sounds like
completely cool and I'm excited.

43:26.825 --> 43:28.854
I'm glad you could come.

43:31.395 --> 43:35.667
I love it. It's so cute. Oh, my God.

43:35.767 --> 43:38.532
It's great, so great.

43:38.632 --> 43:42.240
What is this? Can we go for a ride?

43:43.540 --> 43:46.165
- Let's just hike.
- Are there trails?

43:46.265 --> 43:50.513
- We'll bushwhack.
- Okay. I like how adventurous you are.

43:59.089 --> 44:02.961
I'm Debbie Spangler!

44:05.964 --> 44:07.766
No echo.

44:08.566 --> 44:11.436
Oh, I feel like
I'm getting good at this.

44:11.536 --> 44:14.105
- What?
- Do you like fish tacos?

44:14.205 --> 44:15.607
I never had them.

44:15.707 --> 44:16.842
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:16.942 --> 44:19.844
- Well, do you like fish?
- I do like fish.

44:23.914 --> 44:26.749
I think you're gonna like this sauce.

44:29.687 --> 44:33.050
And I really don't wanna burn this fish.

44:52.142 --> 44:55.275
Let me just... turn it off...

45:07.759 --> 45:09.394
Adventurous?

45:09.494 --> 45:12.044
Oh, my goodness.

45:20.638 --> 45:22.471
Yes.

45:28.746 --> 45:30.174
Fuck! Fuck!

45:33.917 --> 45:35.321
Again. Yeah.

45:40.792 --> 45:44.694
I'm Debbie Spangler!

45:45.095 --> 45:49.348
I'm Debbie Spangler!

46:00.728 --> 46:03.149
I wanna read my Bible.

46:45.622 --> 46:47.957
You shouldn't have done that.

46:49.126 --> 46:51.196
What's that?

46:51.296 --> 46:55.899
- We shouldn't have.
- Done what? Last night?

46:57.568 --> 47:00.839
I don't like myself right now
and I really wish that I hadn't come.

47:04.008 --> 47:07.245
That's too bad, you know,
because I really enjoyed...

47:07.345 --> 47:09.914
Well, I feel terrible.

47:10.014 --> 47:12.417
I feel so terrible.

47:12.717 --> 47:14.819
I feel so bad, and it's all your fault.

47:14.919 --> 47:18.089
You are a terrible person
for doing this to me!

47:18.189 --> 47:20.381
Hold on a second. You know, I...

47:20.481 --> 47:24.029
I'm sorry if you feel like you did
something that you didn't wanna do,

47:24.129 --> 47:28.533
but I would never force you
to do anything.

47:28.633 --> 47:31.559
And really, we didn't do anything wrong.

47:31.659 --> 47:34.112
- You know. It's okay. No.
- Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

47:34.212 --> 47:36.274
- What are you...
- Yes, we did, Otto!

47:36.374 --> 47:39.778
- No.
- You're someone's father.

47:40.078 --> 47:42.747
Oh, my God, this is
the worst thing in the world.

47:42.847 --> 47:45.750
- No. Debbie, no, it's not.
- I don't even know you.

47:45.850 --> 47:48.753
We don't even know each other.
Who are you? Who are you?

47:48.853 --> 47:50.722
- I'm Otto Wall.
- You are a crazy person.

47:50.822 --> 47:53.548
- I'm not crazy.
- Yes, you are. You're a crazy person.

47:53.648 --> 47:56.261
How did I even end up
going with you at all?

47:56.361 --> 47:59.870
- What did you say to me? What did you do?
- You wrote to me and...

47:59.970 --> 48:03.134
Well, I was out of my mind!

48:03.234 --> 48:06.212
- Debbie...
- I wasn't thinking. Stop it!

48:07.337 --> 48:12.375
Why was it me?
Why was it Debbie Spangler?

48:19.816 --> 48:23.386
Wait, your... wait, your bag,
your bag, your bag.

48:36.733 --> 48:38.468
Ede.

48:45.142 --> 48:48.830
And what is this?

48:50.114 --> 48:52.949
Oh, my goodness!
Okay, can I have that, please?

48:53.750 --> 48:56.988
That is a toy. And it's for adults.

48:57.088 --> 49:00.258
- How do you use it?
- It... it's...

49:00.558 --> 49:04.694
It's for adults. How's school, Ede?

49:05.063 --> 49:07.098
Man, don't laugh.

49:07.198 --> 49:08.900
It was terrible!

49:09.000 --> 49:12.270
You know, when she was
holding it in her little hand.

49:12.670 --> 49:15.506
It's funny though. You can't see that?

49:15.606 --> 49:19.410
- Am I screwing her up?
- Oh, that Debbie sounds like a maniac.

49:19.510 --> 49:24.182
No, she's a nice person.
Kinda unstable, but... you know...

49:24.282 --> 49:28.186
Jeez, you know, what could I do?
I can't handle that. These women...

49:28.286 --> 49:30.855
You don't... you don't promise them
anything, do you?

49:30.955 --> 49:34.225
I like them. I want them to be happy.

49:34.325 --> 49:37.428
No, sex. That's what you all want.

49:37.528 --> 49:40.598
It was not like this when I was single.

49:40.698 --> 49:42.999
<i>And after 11 years of Annie not...</i>

49:44.101 --> 49:46.869
You know, the last two years,
we never...

49:48.839 --> 49:51.324
There wasn't any love. So...

49:52.242 --> 49:56.012
<i>And maybe I should take
some responsibility there too.</i>

49:57.014 --> 50:01.072
You know, she was always
secretive and... and...

50:01.172 --> 50:03.052
distant.

50:03.353 --> 50:06.124
You know, I guess, I...

50:06.624 --> 50:09.815
I guess I just gave up
trying to reach her.

50:13.864 --> 50:17.166
I did not know
what was going on with her.

50:18.035 --> 50:21.237
And I don't... I don't... I don't...

50:22.172 --> 50:24.707
I don't know if I ever did.

50:27.043 --> 50:29.645
God, that is so sad.

50:34.818 --> 50:37.322
But now, you know, just...

50:38.122 --> 50:42.193
Just to make someone else
feel good, it's...

50:42.693 --> 50:46.165
you know, it's given me
my confidence back.

50:46.265 --> 50:49.427
You know, as a man.

50:52.269 --> 50:54.739
Freddie, are you still there?

50:55.539 --> 50:58.860
Yeah. You sound like a girl.
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.879
Listen, go for a run.
It'll all feel better.

51:01.979 --> 51:04.282
I gotta save some kids' lives
here, buddy.

51:04.382 --> 51:07.735
<i>You're okay. Bye-bye.</i>

51:13.256 --> 51:15.724
Oh, God!

51:27.370 --> 51:29.941
- Maybe we... Listen, listen, listen.
- What?

51:30.041 --> 51:33.311
This is so important. This is so important.
We've to be quiet, okay?

51:33.411 --> 51:35.046
- Okay.
- My daughter's sleeping.

51:35.146 --> 51:37.247
Okay. We'll be kinda quiet.

51:46.390 --> 51:50.244
- Are you okay?
- No, I think I swallowed my tooth.

51:50.344 --> 51:53.998
- You did what?
- I think I swallowed my tooth.

51:54.098 --> 51:55.366
Your tooth?

51:55.466 --> 51:58.316
I did. I swallowed my fake tooth.

51:59.837 --> 52:02.605
You swallowed your tooth!

52:04.975 --> 52:07.378
- It's not funny...
- It is funny.

52:07.478 --> 52:11.547
- No, it's not.
- Maybe we should get upstairs.

52:29.066 --> 52:31.515
Oh, it's fine.

52:33.537 --> 52:37.475
- Okay.
- Hey, do you maybe wanna go on a date?

52:37.575 --> 52:38.910
What?

52:39.010 --> 52:43.614
Well, I was thinking, Mildred...
maybe we could go to a movie.

52:47.084 --> 52:52.023
I'm sorry... but are you,
like, wanting more?

52:52.123 --> 52:55.426
'Cause I don't... I don't think
that that's what I want.

52:55.526 --> 52:59.130
Yeah, I mean, and this...
this thing that we have...

52:59.230 --> 53:02.834
that's awesome for me, you know?

53:03.501 --> 53:05.169
Is that okay with you?

53:05.269 --> 53:08.570
I mean, what do you...
what do you think that you want?

53:09.540 --> 53:11.211
I...

53:12.743 --> 53:16.113
Okay. Alright, goodnight, Otto.

53:16.213 --> 53:18.481
Goodnight, Mildred.

53:18.949 --> 53:20.608
I'm in.

53:26.657 --> 53:30.538
- You know, you are kind of a disaster.
- Really?

53:30.638 --> 53:34.030
Yeah. But you're a crazy fun fuck.

53:35.599 --> 53:37.633
Hurrah!

53:38.101 --> 53:40.469
And you make me feel pretty.

53:53.917 --> 53:55.951
Daddy!

53:57.788 --> 54:01.626
Oh, hey, what is it?
What is it? What is it?

54:01.726 --> 54:04.301
You can't leave me.

54:04.895 --> 54:07.730
I'm not gonna leave you.

54:09.366 --> 54:11.600
Hey, hey.

54:12.569 --> 54:15.907
Listen, listen, listen, I'm right here.

54:16.007 --> 54:19.710
Okay? I love you more
than anything in the world.

54:19.810 --> 54:23.117
Come here. Come here.

54:42.799 --> 54:47.126
Otto! Otto! Otto Wall is here.

54:47.226 --> 54:49.037
Otto.

54:50.874 --> 54:53.311
Hey. Hey, Otto.

54:53.411 --> 54:55.254
You remember me?

54:55.354 --> 54:58.283
- Liz! Liz! Liz, Otto came.
- You don't remember me, do you?

54:58.583 --> 55:02.053
Liz's mother's here. Remember her?
There she is!

55:02.153 --> 55:04.475
You look killer, man.

55:04.575 --> 55:07.925
- Otto!
- Hey, Liz.

55:08.125 --> 55:12.395
- And Lara said she's coming from Raleigh.
- Oh, really?

55:16.266 --> 55:18.734
I thought I was gonna...

55:19.703 --> 55:23.418
- How many kids do you have?
- I just have one.

55:23.518 --> 55:26.311
Ede. She's nine.

55:26.811 --> 55:29.614
And I... I'm separated.

55:29.714 --> 55:34.085
- From her?
- No, no. From my wife.

55:34.185 --> 55:35.920
We're getting a divorce.

55:36.020 --> 55:38.589
Well, you're young.
Lots more fish out there.

55:38.689 --> 55:41.226
So he's tearing down the hill
and leaps into the water...

55:41.326 --> 55:43.631
I knew you'd be late.

55:43.731 --> 55:46.297
This looks awesome.

55:46.397 --> 55:49.667
- You did a great job...
- Well, thank you.

55:49.767 --> 55:52.837
Well, you know, it wouldn't be the same
without you. I'm so glad you came.

55:52.937 --> 55:55.607
And then he starts just
swimming around with this pitiful...

55:56.507 --> 55:58.342
- This is Rosie.
- How are you?

55:58.442 --> 55:59.709
Good.

56:01.545 --> 56:05.249
<i>Hooray up she rises, hooray up she rises</i>

56:05.349 --> 56:09.153
<i>Hooray up she rises early in the morning</i>

56:09.253 --> 56:10.821
<i>Put him in the rain till he gets sober</i>

56:10.921 --> 56:15.159
- You still don't remember me?
- Just one second.

56:15.259 --> 56:17.161
<i>...early in the morning</i>

56:17.261 --> 56:21.165
<i>Hooray up she rises, hooray up she rises</i>

56:21.265 --> 56:24.935
<i>Hooray up she rises early in the morning</i>

56:25.035 --> 56:28.873
<i>That's what we do with a drunken sailor
That's what we do with a drunken sailor</i>

56:28.973 --> 56:31.776
<i>That's what we do
with a drunken sailor...</i>

56:31.876 --> 56:35.279
- Lara... where are you going?
- Oh, no.

56:35.379 --> 56:38.182
- Oh, my God, Otto!
- Where were you going?

56:38.867 --> 56:42.650
- You're not here.
- You can't leave right now. Come on.

56:42.750 --> 56:47.291
I have to. I'm... I'm getting...
I'm driving back to Raleigh.

56:47.391 --> 56:50.795
I'm getting scuba... sort of vacation.

56:50.895 --> 56:53.331
You can't go.
We didn't even get a chance...

56:53.431 --> 56:55.480
I know, I know.

56:55.580 --> 56:58.603
- It's... but it's my last class.
- ...first saw you and I didn't...

56:58.703 --> 57:01.405
I didn't even think
that I could, you know...

57:01.505 --> 57:05.543
I didn't even think I could come here
tonight at all. Oh, my God.

57:05.643 --> 57:07.482
Yeah. So...

57:09.847 --> 57:12.983
- You rascal!
- I'm not a rascal.

57:13.083 --> 57:16.454
Can I... you know, can I give you my...

57:17.154 --> 57:19.586
Can I give you my e-mail, and...

57:19.986 --> 57:22.994
- figure out how this... Okay.
- Here, let me. I can.

57:23.094 --> 57:26.216
- Otto, I'm planning a trip.
- You are.

57:26.316 --> 57:28.799
- How are you?
- I'm...

57:28.899 --> 57:32.110
- What have you done with your life?
- I...

57:32.210 --> 57:36.505
Thanks. My husband gave me this thing.

57:38.315 --> 57:41.379
It's a really nice present.
I got one for my daughter.

57:41.479 --> 57:44.728
Ginny said you have a little girl.

57:44.828 --> 57:46.565
I do.

57:49.986 --> 57:52.628
Does she have your eyelashes?

57:54.791 --> 57:59.998
Remember when we put mascara on you
because we thought you are so... pretty?

58:00.998 --> 58:03.767
No, I have no memory of that at all.

58:03.867 --> 58:07.271
Yeah. Do you think I could
still block you at the rim?

58:07.371 --> 58:10.374
- Can you still jump?
- Of course.

58:10.874 --> 58:13.077
At least you're a little taller
than me now.

58:13.177 --> 58:15.346
Come on, you guys. Come on.

58:15.446 --> 58:18.916
- I... I've gotta go.
- No. No, you don't.

58:19.016 --> 58:22.351
Oh, this was so wonderful.
Thank you so much.

58:23.586 --> 58:25.656
See you, bye. Bye.

58:25.756 --> 58:28.740
Okay, thank you, Ginny,
it was really wonderful.

58:28.840 --> 58:34.064
Typical. Always flying away.
Well, come on, you don't have to go.

58:36.350 --> 58:40.220
<i>Make new friends but keep the old</i>

58:40.320 --> 58:43.891
<i>One is silver and the other's gold</i>

58:43.991 --> 58:48.112
<i>A circle is round and has no end</i>

58:48.212 --> 58:52.049
<i>That's how long I want to be your friend</i>

58:52.149 --> 58:55.948
<i>Make new friends but keep the old</i>

59:06.563 --> 59:10.766
Richard Watts.
His name was Richard Watts.

59:11.568 --> 59:13.237
What?

59:14.029 --> 59:15.705
Nothing.

59:16.639 --> 59:19.076
- Daddy.
- Yeah.

59:19.176 --> 59:22.280
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

59:22.980 --> 59:25.751
I don't wanna spend the night
here anymore.

59:27.151 --> 59:28.519
Why not?

59:29.896 --> 59:33.190
I don't feel safe. It's not safe.

59:33.290 --> 59:36.627
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

59:36.727 --> 59:40.464
There are robbers here. And accidents.

59:40.564 --> 59:45.320
And... I think you'd have more fun
if I wasn't around at night too.

59:52.576 --> 59:56.647
Say, go to sleep. I love you.

59:56.747 --> 59:59.015
I love you too, Daddy.

01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:33.609
What? Sorry.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:36.120
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, it's Otto.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.423
- Who?
- Otto. Otto Wall.

01:00:40.445 --> 01:00:43.661
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm...

01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:47.431
My mind's on... on other things.

01:00:47.531 --> 01:00:49.114
Hi, Otto Wall.

01:00:49.866 --> 01:00:54.204
So you got home alright.
Are you... are you certified now?

01:00:54.304 --> 01:00:59.492
Oh, yes. I'm so...
I'm so spacing. Sorry.

01:00:59.592 --> 01:01:03.012
I have done some divin'...

01:01:04.057 --> 01:01:07.251
Well, snorkeling really.

01:01:07.351 --> 01:01:10.370
Yeah? Oh, well, we used to...

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:14.091
take the kids snorkeling
when they were... when they were little.

01:01:14.191 --> 01:01:18.462
- Hey, how many kids did you...
- <i>Grant had two when we got married</i>

01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:23.262
and now Carter is 22 and Elaina is 19.

01:01:23.362 --> 01:01:25.963
So I am done...

01:01:26.063 --> 01:01:29.221
completely. I'm free. Yahoo!

01:01:30.841 --> 01:01:32.910
Yeah. Ginny said that you...

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:37.848
That I'm getting divorced.
Yep. Just filed last week.

01:01:38.348 --> 01:01:41.318
<i>You too, she said. Sorry.</i>

01:01:41.418 --> 01:01:43.320
Thanks.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.590
It's okay.

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.126
The whole thing's kind of a mystery,
isn't it?

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:51.293
<i>Oh, I hear ya.</i>

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:55.199
I'm packing right now.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:56.967
<i>You're moving?</i>

01:01:57.067 --> 01:02:02.473
Well, I found this...
this surfing school in Costa Rica.

01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:06.677
So I'm... I'm gonna go there
for six weeks and do this...

01:02:06.777 --> 01:02:11.382
like, total immersion
Spanish thing. So...

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:15.286
And then, I'm doing
a... a building project

01:02:15.386 --> 01:02:19.456
in Papua New Guinea for a year.

01:02:19.556 --> 01:02:21.525
My God.

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:24.415
That sounds just like you.

01:02:24.515 --> 01:02:28.332
When you got the chance,
jump off the cliff, remember?

01:02:28.632 --> 01:02:30.934
- Yeah.
- <i>What... what about you?</i>

01:02:31.034 --> 01:02:34.864
- <i>How are you getting through?</i>
- How am I... what... how what?

01:02:34.964 --> 01:02:40.210
Yeah. I mean, did she break your heart
or did you, you know, did you break hers?

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:44.281
Oh, I... I don't know.

01:02:44.381 --> 01:02:46.348
She was seeing someone.

01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:52.521
Hey, did you and your husband,
did you fight?

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:57.093
God, yeah.

01:02:58.068 --> 01:03:01.999
Yes. Mark, my... my first husband...

01:03:02.099 --> 01:03:06.303
he tried to... kill me more than once.

01:03:06.403 --> 01:03:09.707
<i>And I have a restraining order
against him.</i>

01:03:10.007 --> 01:03:12.643
<i>I mean, I still... I still do.</i>

01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:15.631
God, Lara, how did you...

01:03:15.731 --> 01:03:16.884
Survive?

01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:19.615
Yeah.

01:03:20.183 --> 01:03:24.689
Well... well, what...
what can I tell you?

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:28.391
I don't know what Ginny said.

01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:32.396
Mark and I had a son...

01:03:32.496 --> 01:03:34.830
that drowned, Otto.

01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:39.768
I'm so sorry.

01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:42.139
Yeah. Thanks.

01:03:42.239 --> 01:03:44.214
You know, I...

01:03:44.314 --> 01:03:50.280
I have no idea how I... you know,
how I did it, and I have no answers.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.236
You just... you...

01:03:52.336 --> 01:03:57.588
you know, you take all this stuff...
all this life stuff

01:03:57.688 --> 01:04:00.493
<i>and... and... and you...</i>

01:04:00.593 --> 01:04:04.094
<i>can, you know, collapse or you can not.</i>

01:04:04.194 --> 01:04:08.363
<i>And I... I chose... I chose not to.</i>

01:04:12.068 --> 01:04:15.506
But I'll... I'll tell you, Otto.

01:04:15.606 --> 01:04:18.921
I... I think ab...
I think about him all the time.

01:04:21.177 --> 01:04:23.280
<i>And that's...</i>

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.551
that's... you know,
I guess I do it for him.

01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:31.588
I just continue... for Paul.

01:04:31.688 --> 01:04:34.423
That was his name.

01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:40.030
<i>You... you know, you make a choice...</i>

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:44.799
<i>and you live your life, and that's it.</i>

01:04:47.837 --> 01:04:49.438
So deep.

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:59.361
Anyway, I'm looking
to have an adventure...

01:04:59.649 --> 01:05:02.753
you know, of my own design.

01:05:02.853 --> 01:05:06.690
I'm thinking of... like,
starting a blog.

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:09.995
Shall I put you on my list?

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.166
Would you... Yes. Sure. Please do.

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:20.067
God, Otto. It's so weird!

01:05:20.437 --> 01:05:22.973
- What is?
- You and me.

01:05:23.073 --> 01:05:26.176
I feel like... I feel like...

01:05:26.276 --> 01:05:28.512
I... we just spoke...

01:05:28.612 --> 01:05:30.414
Yesterday.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:36.153
I know. And it's been,
like... like 20 years.

01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:38.888
- Isn't that crazy? That's a lifetime.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:43.525
It's a riot.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.763
Oh, good.

01:06:47.263 --> 01:06:49.637
I'm so glad to get you.

01:06:50.426 --> 01:06:52.961
Listen, Lara, I was...

01:06:53.963 --> 01:06:58.466
Is there any way I can come see you
sometime? Just drive over and...

01:06:59.135 --> 01:07:00.771
This is Otto.

01:07:00.871 --> 01:07:04.288
Yeah, no, no, no.
No, nothing's wrong. I just...

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:09.110
I would really like to talk
to you some time or...

01:07:09.812 --> 01:07:11.546
When?

01:07:12.948 --> 01:07:16.153
You're in town now? Today?

01:07:16.553 --> 01:07:19.022
I mean, well... if you get
the chance before you go back,

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:21.827
you know, that would...
that would be great.

01:07:22.225 --> 01:07:25.696
No, no, I know.
Just see if it works out.

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:29.199
It's no big deal. Okay.

01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:31.032
Bye.

01:07:39.742 --> 01:07:42.143
Oh, shit.

01:07:57.226 --> 01:07:59.461
I'm back here.

01:08:11.807 --> 01:08:13.441
Hi.

01:08:17.078 --> 01:08:19.412
You have something I want.

01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:26.089
I also, I really want
to apologize, Otto.

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:28.524
I thought about things and...

01:08:28.625 --> 01:08:31.694
I was just freaking out or something
in the mountains.

01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:35.899
- I run a little hot and cold.
- Yeah, just a little.

01:08:36.365 --> 01:08:39.002
You know, it's... it was no big deal.

01:08:39.102 --> 01:08:43.273
We didn't know each other very well and...
you know, maybe we shouldn't have...

01:08:43.372 --> 01:08:45.742
No, I do that sometimes
when I'm overwhelmed.

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:48.076
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:49.044 --> 01:08:51.089
But I prayed about it...

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:53.002
and...

01:08:54.517 --> 01:08:57.479
I really enjoyed myself...

01:08:58.179 --> 01:09:00.270
in the mountains with you.

01:09:00.371 --> 01:09:04.425
Good. I did too for the most part.

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:10.631
And I think that we should...

01:09:11.867 --> 01:09:14.261
get to know each other.

01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:19.441
'Cause I think that you are
a really good father.

01:09:20.576 --> 01:09:22.812
Do you really think so?

01:09:32.054 --> 01:09:33.952
Do...

01:09:34.051 --> 01:09:36.171
you forgive me?

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:38.908
Sure. Sure I do.

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:43.133
Goodness.

01:09:43.233 --> 01:09:45.602
I don't know if...

01:09:46.002 --> 01:09:49.473
Are you sure this is a good... idea...

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:52.640
Debbie... Spangler?

01:09:55.477 --> 01:09:57.211
Yes.

01:09:57.781 --> 01:10:00.200
Oh, my God. I think that's Ede.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.219
- What am I doing? Wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no.

01:10:02.319 --> 01:10:04.653
Come on. No. Don't, don't, don't.

01:10:12.995 --> 01:10:14.998
Aren't you early? Where's Ede?

01:10:15.098 --> 01:10:16.833
She's...

01:10:16.933 --> 01:10:18.735
We need to talk.

01:10:18.835 --> 01:10:21.303
There's been a change of plans.

01:10:23.205 --> 01:10:26.896
What? Oh, so, you get to change
plans just like that? God.

01:10:26.996 --> 01:10:29.377
She cried, Otto.

01:10:29.745 --> 01:10:32.049
She really doesn't want
to come over here.

01:10:32.449 --> 01:10:35.584
- What are you talking about?
- Well, when I finally got her to speak...

01:10:36.786 --> 01:10:38.622
she said...

01:10:38.722 --> 01:10:41.501
that you have girls here all the time.

01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:43.560
I...

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.930
I've never had women here
when Ede's been here.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.727
Really?

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.466
She's says she hears you fucking.

01:10:51.166 --> 01:10:53.804
- What?
- She says that you have sex toys.

01:10:54.804 --> 01:10:58.228
- I...
- Is she lying to me? She's lying to me.

01:10:58.442 --> 01:11:01.378
Listen, there was a...

01:11:01.478 --> 01:11:03.847
There was a woman, a friend...

01:11:03.947 --> 01:11:08.191
A woman who had been
in the car... not with Ede.

01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:12.307
She dropped her sex toy in your car.

01:11:12.955 --> 01:11:14.224
- Annie...
- No!

01:11:14.324 --> 01:11:16.459
I'm not exposing my daughter to that.

01:11:16.559 --> 01:11:20.329
- Come on. She wasn't exposed to anything.
- And I...

01:11:22.531 --> 01:11:25.068
I'm sorry to have to tell you...

01:11:25.168 --> 01:11:28.739
that I'm going to talk to my lawyer
about the joint custody.

01:11:29.139 --> 01:11:30.707
I am.

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:34.706
I... I never thought that you were
this kind of man.

01:11:34.806 --> 01:11:40.817
I didn't. I guess, I just... never really...
knew you very well, ever.

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:43.587
- Annie...
- I thought that you cared

01:11:43.687 --> 01:11:47.124
- about the welfare of your child.
- I do!

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:49.659
Children come first, Otto.

01:11:49.959 --> 01:11:52.294
Parents have to set an example.

01:11:53.545 --> 01:11:56.122
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:11:59.568 --> 01:12:01.637
You mean like having an affair?

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:09.177
You mean, like, fucking somebody
when you're still married.

01:12:10.946 --> 01:12:13.016
Like... like never touching
your husband?

01:12:13.116 --> 01:12:16.186
Is that the kind of example
you thought was healthy for Ede?

01:12:16.286 --> 01:12:18.722
- Otto. I...
- Yeah? I know about it.

01:12:18.822 --> 01:12:21.325
I know what you did. I saw it on the...

01:12:21.425 --> 01:12:23.493
I know about it. What about that?

01:12:23.693 --> 01:12:28.632
And he looks like a real upstanding
citizen too, is he? Is he?

01:12:28.732 --> 01:12:32.503
And does Ede not know what her mother's
doing in the bedroom next to hers?

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:35.272
- In my bed!
- Don't you yell at me.

01:12:35.372 --> 01:12:40.076
- You've never spoken to me like this.
- I know! It's about time.

01:12:40.176 --> 01:12:42.198
You don't have any room to judge me.

01:12:42.298 --> 01:12:46.016
My life... is my own.

01:12:46.116 --> 01:12:49.653
Richard is a wonderful man...
and father.

01:12:49.753 --> 01:12:52.622
You don't fucking know him... okay?

01:12:52.722 --> 01:12:55.292
- When we started texting, I...
- Oh, my God.

01:12:55.392 --> 01:12:57.115
And what...

01:12:57.215 --> 01:12:58.942
- What I did...
- What, yeah?

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.565
- What I did... I did it.
- Justify it. Come on.

01:13:01.665 --> 01:13:03.400
- I needed it.
- Okay.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.235
- To survive!
- Okay.

01:13:05.335 --> 01:13:09.673
- You're an asshole! Fuck it!
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

01:13:09.773 --> 01:13:14.545
I just... I have to get to the nursing home
to bathe Mr. Peterson by 6:00.

01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:17.478
I'm Debbie Spangler.

01:13:22.684 --> 01:13:25.021
And she's crazy.

01:13:25.121 --> 01:13:29.057
You are a very sweet man.

01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:36.798
Bless you.

01:14:04.627 --> 01:14:07.152
I try to teach Ede...

01:14:07.964 --> 01:14:11.599
that a woman has the right
to be loved...

01:14:12.534 --> 01:14:14.310
and to be known.

01:14:59.748 --> 01:15:02.150
Yoo-hoo. Anybody home?

01:15:07.289 --> 01:15:10.725
I was kinda worried
about you from your call.

01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:14.996
You okay, old friend?

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:23.699
Can I go to Costa Rica with you
and learn how to surf and Spanish?

01:15:23.799 --> 01:15:25.609
Sure.

01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:29.112
Do you wanna come with me to Raleigh
and have dinner with my kids?

01:15:29.412 --> 01:15:32.933
If I had left 15 minutes ago,
I'd still be late.

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:39.592
I see you have some
half-finished projects.

01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:43.691
- Yeah.
- That's familiar.

01:15:44.226 --> 01:15:45.662
Yeah.

01:15:45.762 --> 01:15:47.897
Where'd you get these?

01:15:48.914 --> 01:15:51.835
They're river stones from the mountains.

01:15:51.935 --> 01:15:53.777
I love 'em.

01:16:06.782 --> 01:16:09.819
So... hard day?

01:16:09.919 --> 01:16:13.393
I mean, do you wanna...
do you wanna tell me about it?

01:16:22.464 --> 01:16:24.234
I...

01:16:24.534 --> 01:16:26.968
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:16:28.404 --> 01:16:30.721
I haven't...

01:16:31.941 --> 01:16:34.242
I mean, I really...

01:16:36.578 --> 01:16:39.109
I should've been a better parent.

01:16:43.619 --> 01:16:47.802
Yeah, I mean,
everybody feels that way. It's...

01:16:48.302 --> 01:16:50.360
It's normal.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.495
Yeah, I want you to meet Ede.

01:16:53.995 --> 01:16:57.131
Is she... is she here?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.165
No, she won't come here.

01:17:05.073 --> 01:17:07.675
Well, do you have a picture?

01:17:09.178 --> 01:17:10.812
Yes.

01:17:15.484 --> 01:17:17.946
She's wonderful.

01:17:19.188 --> 01:17:21.422
I can see you.

01:17:25.594 --> 01:17:27.930
I don't want to lose her.

01:17:31.467 --> 01:17:33.738
I'd show you...

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:37.907
I'd show you my two if I could,
you know, figure out...

01:17:38.007 --> 01:17:40.808
how this thing works.

01:17:44.143 --> 01:17:46.447
They're yelling at me...

01:17:47.382 --> 01:17:49.617
'cause I'm not on the road.

01:17:51.387 --> 01:17:53.021
Okay.

01:17:53.889 --> 01:17:56.893
- Are you coming with me?
- Can I stay?

01:17:56.993 --> 01:18:00.934
- The night? Of course.
- Can we play around?

01:18:01.798 --> 01:18:03.099
For a few days?

01:18:03.299 --> 01:18:05.935
- Nope.
- Why not?

01:18:06.035 --> 01:18:10.067
I'm on a plane at 6:45 tomorrow morning.

01:18:10.406 --> 01:18:13.908
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- Didn't I tell you that?

01:18:18.013 --> 01:18:22.183
I'm gonna miss you too, Otto...
now that we've reconnected.

01:18:26.054 --> 01:18:27.788
Sorry.

01:18:31.093 --> 01:18:33.461
Why don't you come with me?

01:18:35.897 --> 01:18:38.799
- What?
- Seriously.

01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:41.235
Why not?

01:18:41.904 --> 01:18:45.380
A week or so. That's not hard.

01:18:46.374 --> 01:18:48.776
Drop everything.

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:55.985
Yeah.

01:18:56.085 --> 01:18:59.855
- Could I?
- Yes. Yes. You can.

01:18:59.955 --> 01:19:01.589
You can.

01:19:03.925 --> 01:19:05.726
Otto...

01:19:31.019 --> 01:19:33.054
Follow me.

01:20:37.886 --> 01:20:42.999
Ede. Oh, Ede, I'm so glad you picked up.

01:20:43.658 --> 01:20:48.488
No, no, no. That's okay. Your mom
told me that you had other plans.

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:50.965
Hey, what are you doing?

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:55.202
That sounds like fun.

01:20:55.804 --> 01:20:57.505
Me?

01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:02.930
Well, I'm building the walls
of your castle.

01:21:03.695 --> 01:21:06.470
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:09.586
Would you...

01:21:09.686 --> 01:21:14.721
Maybe you'd wanna come over?
I need to know exactly how you want it.

01:21:15.624 --> 01:21:17.358
Yeah.

01:21:18.827 --> 01:21:22.404
Sure. Sure there can be.

01:21:23.899 --> 01:21:26.133
We can do that.

01:21:27.536 --> 01:21:31.282
Yes. Yes. A moat?
