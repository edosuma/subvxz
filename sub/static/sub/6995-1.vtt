you're going
to Briersville, hmm,

where to change trains.

to do now, Nockman,

end up like my Mum.

doing back here?

I thought
you were adopted.

I'd rather be here.

you left us, Molly.

something missing.

Of course.

She hardly ever
comes out anymore.

So who's
looking after you?

01:26:56.717 --> 01:26:58.884
I am.

Come here.

01:27:05.651 --> 01:27:06.817
Rocky.

01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:09.617
I came back this morning

01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:12.317
When I heard
what had been going on.

01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:14.717
Had to make sure
all you sprouts
were all right.

01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.717
Adderstone
was horrible to you.

01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:20.451
I think she's forgotten
about that.

01:27:20.484 --> 01:27:22.617
She's not been
quite herself.

01:27:22.651 --> 01:27:25.584
Well, anyway,
she's leaving today.

still hypnotized?

I'm just waiting for a taxi.

01:27:43.616 --> 01:27:47.250
