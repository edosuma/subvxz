00:15.780 --> 00:18.214
You see, this is what I hate
about Christmas.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.647
Angie from the print shop
sent me a card

00:20.714 --> 00:22.014
but I didn't send her one.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.880
Now, I gotta go back
and fight those crowds

00:23.947 --> 00:25.414
for another one of these.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.847
Oh, no, you don't.

00:26.914 --> 00:28.247
Watch and learn.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.014
There you go,
a Christmas postcard.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.780
Alright, my Herald Angel

00:35.847 --> 00:37.814
our holiday prayers
have been answered.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.247
Peace on Earth?

00:39.314 --> 00:41.380
Uh, different prayer.

00:41.447 --> 00:44.080
Um, due
to a last‐minute cancellation

00:44.147 --> 00:46.480
I was able to rent
the rustic Canadian cabin

00:46.547 --> 00:49.047
where I spent
many a boyhood Christmas.

00:49.114 --> 00:50.080
‐ What?
‐ Oh, Overton.

00:50.147 --> 00:51.247
Is that the same cabin

00:51.314 --> 00:53.214
your family
used to caravan to every year?

00:53.280 --> 00:54.547
All 11 of us.

00:54.614 --> 00:56.514
Twelve, if you include
the plastic Santa

00:56.580 --> 01:00.387
ridin' proudly atop
the lead LeSabre. Pff..

01:00.454 --> 01:02.820
They actually let you
enter their country like that?

01:02.887 --> 01:06.254
[chuckles]
The tragedy is
they let them return. Aha.

01:07.820 --> 01:09.787
My heart fills
with the memories.

01:09.854 --> 01:13.520
The savory turkey, Christmas
carols around the fire.

01:13.587 --> 01:16.487
It was like livin'
in a Norman Rockwell painting

01:16.554 --> 01:18.620
e‐except
without all the white people.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.420
Anyway, hey, why don't y'all
come up there with us?

01:22.487 --> 01:23.754
I mean, my family can't be there

01:23.820 --> 01:26.987
but we'll still have a good
old‐fashioned Jones' Christmas.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.954
Hey, I'm with it. I'm sick
of Christmas in the city.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.787
Snow all covered with soot

01:31.854 --> 01:34.454
and then
those department stores' Santas

01:34.520 --> 01:36.454
tryin' to lure you
on to they lap.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.487
Well, I'd love to join you
for this little Arctic romp

01:42.554 --> 01:45.587
but I have plans
for a special Christmas getaway.

01:45.654 --> 01:48.287
‐ Ha‐ha ha‐ha!
‐ Hm. Which cave would that be?

01:50.820 --> 01:51.920
The Poconos.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.920
The Matterhorn o'plenty
ski ‐lodge and buffet.

01:54.987 --> 01:56.787
Well, ho‐ho‐hold up, Maxine.

01:56.854 --> 02:00.320
You made Christmas plans
without telling me?

02:00.387 --> 02:02.527
Well, I didn't want to insult
you with the Christmas getaway

02:02.594 --> 02:05.627
Mr. Kwanzaa, but, uh,
if you'd like to tag along‐‐

02:05.694 --> 02:06.794
No, no, no.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.560
Kyle Barker
will not be spending Christmas

02:09.627 --> 02:11.927
as an afterthought. Thank you.

02:11.994 --> 02:13.427
Overton, I'm in.

02:13.494 --> 02:14.760
Even though you did only ask me

02:14.827 --> 02:15.993
a few minutes before girly did

02:16.060 --> 02:17.393
but you..

02:19.460 --> 02:21.094
I'd join you,
but I promised my mom

02:21.160 --> 02:22.960
I'd join
her and her bowling buddies

02:23.027 --> 02:26.027
for Christmas potluck
and five‐dollar grab bag.

They say snowplows seldom
venture up towards the cabin.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.700
We could be snowed in for days

03:17.767 --> 03:20.300

"The Shining."

03:20.367 --> 03:21.634
Here's Obie.

of Maxine goin' up a ski lift

What can I say? I'm happy.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.800
I mean,
I'm not one of those girls

03:47.867 --> 03:50.267
who needs a man hanging on her
arm like some kind of ornament.

03:50.334 --> 03:52.134
[chuckles]
Ladies!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.734
I would like for you
to meet my date

03:57.800 --> 04:00.034
an actor I've grown
quite close to at the soap.

04:00.100 --> 04:03.174
[chuckles]
His name is Tyler,
but he plays Brent.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.907
Actually, my name is Brent
and I play Tyler.

04:05.974 --> 04:08.040
[chuckles]

04:08.107 --> 04:12.340
(both)
Ornament!

04:12.407 --> 04:13.740
Here we are, people.

04:13.807 --> 04:17.440
Welcome to our little retreat
from all things civilized.

04:19.307 --> 04:21.839
‐ Ohh, right in here.
‐ Oh, yeah!

04:21.906 --> 04:25.207
‐ 'This is sweet.'
‐ I don't believe this!

04:25.274 --> 04:27.874
I mean, what happened
to my stuffed badger

04:27.940 --> 04:31.574
and the wagon‐wheel sofa
and, uh, the hole in the wall

04:31.640 --> 04:35.407
where we kids would throw
our turkey bones after dinner?

04:35.473 --> 04:37.240
I don't know, but if you show me
where that badger was

04:37.307 --> 04:38.373
I can hang a picture of Max.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.074
[chuckles]

04:40.140 --> 04:41.740
Overton, come here,
check this out.

04:41.807 --> 04:43.040
Oh.

04:43.107 --> 04:46.007
This is my little
childhood growth chart. Yeah.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.774
"Overton, age six

04:49.840 --> 04:51.607
"Overton, age seven.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.307
Overton, age eight?"

04:55.374 --> 04:58.107
Oh, yeah, that was the year
when I cut off my fro.

05:00.007 --> 05:01.480
Now, Obie,
now, there's still a lot still

05:01.547 --> 05:03.114
to smile about around here.
And you know what?

05:03.180 --> 05:05.014
It'll be even better
when the snow falls.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.980
Oh, girl,
I can't wait to go outside

05:07.047 --> 05:10.080
and sculpt the nativity scene
out of snowman.

05:10.147 --> 05:11.780
Only thing missing
will be Uncle Tibby.

05:11.847 --> 05:14.147
A little too filled up
with holiday spirit

05:14.214 --> 05:16.280
offerin' a swig of brandy
to the sheep.

05:16.347 --> 05:17.980
The sheep.

05:18.047 --> 05:20.114
Man, those stars
are twinklin' tonight.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.747
Let's see how they twinkle
in your eyes, baby.

05:23.547 --> 05:24.980
Aw! Aw!

05:25.047 --> 05:27.080
‐ Whoo!
‐ Whoo!

05:28.680 --> 05:32.247
Whoo! Well, it has been
a long day. I'm gonna turn in.

05:32.314 --> 05:34.847
[yawns]
I am right behind you.
I am so..

05:34.914 --> 05:36.947
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

05:37.014 --> 05:39.580
I only learned your real name
this morning.

05:40.714 --> 05:42.380
You mean, this isn't a, uh

05:42.447 --> 05:44.514
romantic rendezvous?

05:44.580 --> 05:46.714
Well, my, my,
aren't we full of ourselves

05:46.780 --> 05:49.314
for somebody who's about to be
written out of the soap.

05:51.547 --> 05:52.514
Oops!

05:54.014 --> 05:56.480
‐ Written out?
‐ Uh..

05:56.547 --> 05:59.414
Let's just say that
my next few wardrobe assignments

05:59.480 --> 06:01.320
called for you
to wear scuba gear

06:01.387 --> 06:03.487
then a hospital gown

06:03.554 --> 06:05.654
and then a toe tag.

06:07.687 --> 06:08.787
I'm dead?

06:10.054 --> 06:11.287
Just as I was about to inherit

06:11.354 --> 06:13.687
my stepfather's
ill‐gotten riches.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.754

Maxine,
w‐what are you doin' here?

06:46.454 --> 06:49.254
Well, those idiots at the
ski lodge lost my reservation.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.087
So, I called the number
you left, hopped the flight

06:51.154 --> 06:53.354
two bags of peanuts later,
<i>voila!</i>

06:53.420 --> 06:55.054

06:59.720 --> 07:01.194

07:03.727 --> 07:05.760

07:05.827 --> 07:08.160
Fine. I propose a pact.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.427
For the next three days
there will be no yelling

07:10.494 --> 07:12.227
there will be
no slamming of doors

07:12.294 --> 07:14.194
not even an upraised finger

07:14.260 --> 07:15.960
unless you do not think
you can handle it

07:16.027 --> 07:17.494
little Ms. Flab Jaw.

07:18.860 --> 07:22.060
I'm more than capable
of civility, you little cretin.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.560
From now on..

07:27.394 --> 07:28.394
...just this.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.727
That gingerbread house
has been in the Jones family

07:43.794 --> 07:45.527
for over 40 years.

07:45.594 --> 07:47.760
[chuckles]
Stale as hell

07:47.827 --> 07:51.027
but, isn't she a beaut?

07:51.094 --> 07:54.994
Hot, spicy apple pancakes
for everyone.

07:55.060 --> 07:59.027
And no one makes them fluffier
than you, sweet‐cake.

07:59.094 --> 08:01.834
Hey, and no one squeezes
an orange like you.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.834
Oh, come here,
let me squeeze you.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.834
Oh!

08:05.967 --> 08:08.134
[chuckles]

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
Uh, if you'll excuse us

08:10.267 --> 08:11.867
we got a date with the Jacuzzi.

08:11.934 --> 08:13.867
Oh, oh! Alright, come, let's go!

08:13.934 --> 08:16.300

08:16.367 --> 08:17.367
Aha!

08:19.867 --> 08:21.334
I don't think
we want to use that later on.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.367
Uh‐uh.

08:24.334 --> 08:26.167
[chuckles]
Yeah.

08:26.234 --> 08:28.500
Hey, y'all see any flurries
out there?

08:28.567 --> 08:30.434
[scoffs]
It's like spring out there?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.967
Half the town
is hangin' out at the mall

08:32.034 --> 08:33.467
just for the air conditioner.

08:33.534 --> 08:34.734
‐ A mall?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.734
Actually there are two,
not to mention

08:36.799 --> 08:38.866
several luxury hotels,
couple of restaurants

08:38.933 --> 08:40.134
and a piercing parlor.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.400
I don't get it,
I mean, last time I was here

08:43.467 --> 08:45.300
only thing they had
was a general store

08:45.367 --> 08:46.600
a fillin' station

08:46.667 --> 08:49.700
and a take‐out joint called
Canucky Fried Chicken.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.334
That must have been
before they built

08:52.400 --> 08:53.700
the big amusement park
up the road.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.500
Six Flags over Petawawa?

08:57.534 --> 08:59.034
Well, you just let civilization

08:59.100 --> 09:01.107
try to encroach on
my little Eden

09:01.174 --> 09:03.640
but no one can take away
the Jones family tradition

09:03.707 --> 09:06.307
of choppin' down
its very own Christmas tree.

09:06.374 --> 09:08.540
‐ Nah.
‐ Well, let's go.

09:08.607 --> 09:12.307
All we ever got to do
was assemble ours. Come on!

09:12.374 --> 09:15.440
Hey, come on, y'all, now
how am I supposed to sleep in

09:15.507 --> 09:18.374
if y'all have
all that racket goin' on?

09:18.440 --> 09:21.274
Girl, look, it is
a beautiful day out there.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.640
I mean, you can actually
take a deep breath

09:23.707 --> 09:26.374
without swallowing
something solid.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.607
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

09:28.674 --> 09:31.040
Oh. Does that bag say "Sex?"

09:31.107 --> 09:34.207
You bet, it's a half mile
up the road, next to Nieman's.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.374
‐ Nieman's?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

09:35.440 --> 09:37.907
Oh, hold my cars.
I'll be at the mall.

09:40.374 --> 09:42.007
Listen, um..

09:42.074 --> 09:44.607
I'm really sorry about lettin'
that slip out last night.

09:44.674 --> 09:46.340
I, I just assumed
that you knew

09:46.407 --> 09:48.707
your character
was going to be choked to death

09:48.774 --> 09:50.974
by a pregnant octopus.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.607
Wow, Khadijah and I thought

09:52.674 --> 09:54.307
it was gonna be an angry husband
with a blowgun.

09:54.374 --> 09:57.307
[laughing]

09:58.540 --> 10:00.480
Oh, so, um..

10:00.547 --> 10:03.180
So, so you two have,
have talked about this, then.

10:03.247 --> 10:04.480
‐ Oh!
‐ Ooh.

10:04.547 --> 10:06.514
Practically, all night, I mean,
if it wasn't for Khadijah

10:06.580 --> 10:09.780
I'd still be wanderin' around,
feelin' sorry for myself.

10:09.847 --> 10:11.947
‐ Now I'm ready to die.
‐ To die?

10:12.014 --> 10:14.814
[laughing]

10:14.880 --> 10:16.714
‐ 'Die already.'
‐ Khadijah!

10:16.780 --> 10:18.547
(Brent)
'You got me. Oh.'

10:18.614 --> 10:22.614
Thank you for taking the time
to comfort my date.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.580
Oh, well, thank you
for makin' it necessary.

10:34.347 --> 10:36.980
‐ Are these two with you?
‐ Yeah. What's goin' on?

10:37.047 --> 10:40.347
I'm Constable Robeson,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

10:43.114 --> 10:45.047
Yes, there are black Mounties.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.414
I apprehend
that Ms. James and Mr. Jones

10:49.480 --> 10:50.780
engaged
in the willful destruction

10:50.847 --> 10:53.414
of the Canadian National Forest.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.314
Alright,
you can't make it stick.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.147
You can't give him a citation
on Christmas Eve.

10:59.214 --> 11:01.854
It's Christmas Eve
for trees, too, eh?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.954
Even if they don't celebrate it
as we do.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.454
Oh..

11:09.520 --> 11:12.620
I'm sorry, Obie. Maybe
we can pick up a tree in town.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.954
Nah, it just seems like
all my family traditions

11:15.020 --> 11:16.520
are being stripped away.

11:16.587 --> 11:19.120
I mean, no tree,
no hole in the wall

11:19.187 --> 11:22.620
no badger, no outdoor toilet,
nothin'!

11:22.687 --> 11:23.720
[knocking on door]

11:27.120 --> 11:29.554
Is that your van
parked on the road, Mr. Jones?

11:31.187 --> 11:33.887
You're parked within 300
centimeters of a hydrant, eh.

11:39.154 --> 11:40.220
[door shuts]

11:40.287 --> 11:41.454
[mumbles]

11:42.220 --> 11:43.387
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

11:49.664 --> 11:50.930
♪ We go laughing all the way ♪
♪ We go laughing all the way ♪

11:50.997 --> 11:53.397
♪ Ha ha ha ha ha ♪
♪ Ha ha ha ha ha ♪

11:53.464 --> 11:54.764
[laughing]

11:54.830 --> 11:57.697
You two have been snackin'
on some of those wild mushrooms?

11:57.764 --> 12:00.937
Oh, the woods
have transformed us.

12:01.004 --> 12:03.704
I mean, we were hiking up a hill
and Kyle lost his balance

12:03.770 --> 12:06.870
and I actually reached
out a hand to help him.

12:06.937 --> 12:09.970
[chuckles]
And then
we helped deliver a baby deer

12:10.037 --> 12:12.337
and called him Sunshine.

12:12.404 --> 12:13.437
Oh!

12:13.504 --> 12:15.670
[laughing]

12:15.737 --> 12:17.404
[mumbles]

12:17.470 --> 12:20.170
Hey, what do you say, what do
you say we go into the kitchen

12:20.237 --> 12:23.204
and clear off
one of those counters, you know?

12:23.270 --> 12:24.304
‐ Rrrr..
‐ Okay?

12:24.370 --> 12:25.304
Oh, my!

12:26.604 --> 12:29.537
[indistinct chattering]

12:31.770 --> 12:33.804
Hey, I think you might wanna..

12:33.870 --> 12:35.804
...think about ordering out
tonight.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.904
Ah, don't worry, after I catch

12:38.970 --> 12:41.604
those traditional trout
in the stream outback

12:41.670 --> 12:44.970
I'm gonna sizzle 'em up outdoors
just like my daddy used to.

12:45.037 --> 12:47.570
Your family made traditions
out of pretty much everything.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.337
‐ Didn't they?
‐ Yupper.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.537
Every Christmas Eve,
whoever caught the biggest trout

12:51.604 --> 12:53.337
could choose the first carol.

12:53.404 --> 12:55.504
I never forget
when my cousin Margaret led us

12:55.570 --> 13:00.410
in a disturbing rendition
of "I Shot The Sheriff."

13:00.477 --> 13:02.910
But she did not shoot
the deputy.

13:02.977 --> 13:05.910
[laughs]
Let's go, let's go
catch us some fish. Come on.

13:05.977 --> 13:08.077
‐ Oh.
‐ Ooh! Open up!

13:09.344 --> 13:10.577
Good news, everyone.

13:10.644 --> 13:13.177
Santa Regine has arrived

13:13.244 --> 13:16.877
with a festive Christmas tree.

13:18.910 --> 13:21.244
There's your Shooting Stars!
Yes!

13:21.310 --> 13:23.544
An extra point for
knockin' out the goalies, too.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.244
Yeah. You know, you are amazing.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.244
[chuckles]

13:26.310 --> 13:28.244
Yeah, she is, isn't she?

13:29.410 --> 13:30.477
Oh, Regine.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.644
When did you get back?

13:37.144 --> 13:38.244
Never mind.

13:41.577 --> 13:43.310
‐ Is she upset?
‐ Usually.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.844
What now?

13:54.910 --> 13:57.277
Fishing without a license
and interfering with a Mountie

13:57.344 --> 13:59.350
in the performance
of his duties.

14:02.784 --> 14:05.084
All I did was ask him
if I could try on the hat.

14:05.784 --> 14:06.717
Eh.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.884
And Santa's helpers are here.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.984
You know, all your sweetness
and good cheer

14:16.050 --> 14:18.250
is just ruining Christmas
for all of us.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.550
[laughing]

14:31.817 --> 14:35.217
Care to comment,
my beautiful launderette?

14:35.284 --> 14:38.550
Well, who knew a Canadian
rinse cycle would be so hot?

14:40.617 --> 14:42.884
We going to have
a Santa‐less Christmas this year

14:42.950 --> 14:45.917
'cause there's no way
I'm gonna be Saint Nick in pink.

14:47.850 --> 14:49.217
Besides,
these pants are startin'

14:49.284 --> 14:51.250
to get a little too personal.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.084
Alright. Alright, now.
This should..

14:55.150 --> 14:56.584
This should tide you over
till you get back

14:56.650 --> 14:58.517
to your mama's Christmas duck.

14:58.584 --> 15:00.590
Alright, alright.
Thank you, Deej.

15:01.324 --> 15:03.024
‐ Oh!
‐ Deej?

15:03.090 --> 15:05.924
[scoffs]
So, what the hell
is goin' on here?

15:07.690 --> 15:09.257
I'm goin' home
to see my parents.

15:09.324 --> 15:11.590
I thought your parents
fell into a volcano.

15:11.657 --> 15:12.790
[laughs]

15:12.857 --> 15:14.790
Those
are my character's parents.

15:16.590 --> 15:18.090
I haven't seen mine
since I left the circus

15:18.157 --> 15:20.824
to become an actor.
But, now thanks to Deej

15:20.890 --> 15:22.590
I'm gonna have a nice Christmas
with mom, dad

15:22.657 --> 15:24.590
and the rest of
the flying Washingtons, right?

15:25.757 --> 15:27.824
Thank you
for sending me an angel.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.957
‐ So, I'll talk you, huh?
‐ Alright.

15:31.024 --> 15:32.024
‐ Alright.
‐ You take care.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.057
‐ Bye, baby.
‐ Call me then.

15:33.124 --> 15:34.724
‐ Love you.
‐ Alright.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.524
Ah! Uh‐huh?

15:36.590 --> 15:39.124
[laughs]
So, so that's how it is, right?

15:39.190 --> 15:40.757
See, see, see,
you can't have a man

15:40.824 --> 15:41.890
so, I can't have one either,
right?

15:41.957 --> 15:43.624
That's how you gonna play me!

15:46.190 --> 15:47.690
Okay, Santa, Santa.

15:47.757 --> 15:49.924
Time to hand out the gifts,
Go, go, go.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.390
‐ Yeah.
‐ What are you talkin' about?

15:51.457 --> 15:53.957
See, first
you just reel Brent in

15:54.024 --> 15:55.857
with your fake charm
and sympathy

15:55.924 --> 15:57.190
and then when you realized

15:57.257 --> 15:59.557
you couldn't hold on to him
with me around

15:59.624 --> 16:03.164
you sent him to the only woman
who could, his mama.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.364
Kyle, electric socks!

16:06.430 --> 16:08.497
Oh, my feet
are forever in your debt.

16:08.564 --> 16:09.897
[laughing]

16:09.964 --> 16:12.497
Regine, you have tripped
right off the planet.

16:12.564 --> 16:14.230
[scoffs]
Overton

16:14.297 --> 16:17.364
this woman is not to receive
my Christmas gift.

16:17.430 --> 16:19.097
‐ Crazy, you bought it for me.
‐ That's it! That's it!

16:19.164 --> 16:21.864
You're supposed to be my friend!
You're supposed to be my friend!

16:21.930 --> 16:23.797
Take it!

16:23.864 --> 16:26.197
I want you to know
that you have just missed out

16:26.264 --> 16:28.197
on one hell of a picture frame!

16:30.630 --> 16:31.964
A laser disc player?

16:32.030 --> 16:34.197
Max, what happened
to our $20 price limit?

16:34.264 --> 16:36.797
Ah, Kyle, with the mountain air
and the wonderful exchange rate

16:36.864 --> 16:39.930
I guess I got carried away.

16:39.997 --> 16:41.564
But, Max,
you made me look like a fool.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.197
‐ I mean, a cheap fool.
‐ Yeah.

16:43.264 --> 16:44.797
This must be returned.

16:44.864 --> 16:47.364
Uh‐uh. That came from the heart.

16:47.430 --> 16:51.230
No, that came from the sick,
twisted place inside of you

16:51.297 --> 16:53.630
that compels you
to upstage everyone.

16:53.697 --> 16:55.964
And you know what?
It's not even top of the line.

16:57.197 --> 16:59.870
Well, neither are you,
you big‐old gas bag.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.104
Oh, wow!

17:04.170 --> 17:06.369
A Cleveland Indians
limited edition

17:06.436 --> 17:07.804
World Series ornament.

17:07.869 --> 17:10.304
Thanks, Synclaire,
you salvaged my Christmas.

17:11.337 --> 17:12.470
[sighs]

17:20.670 --> 17:22.337
Well, ho‐ho‐ho.

17:31.337 --> 17:33.170
‐ Hi.
‐ Sweet pea.

17:33.237 --> 17:35.270
How'd you find me way out here?

17:36.604 --> 17:38.737
I asked around.

17:38.804 --> 17:41.370
You're the only
black, pink Santa in town.

17:43.137 --> 17:44.437
[people screaming]

17:44.504 --> 17:45.470
What's that?

17:46.704 --> 17:49.804
Eh, it's the rollercoaster
over at Six Flags.

17:50.604 --> 17:52.604
The Eviscerator.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.170
Obie, I know
things didn't turn out

17:54.237 --> 17:55.704
exactly the way
you wanted them to

17:55.770 --> 17:57.137
but isn't the important thing

17:57.204 --> 17:59.044
that you're here
with your friends?

17:59.110 --> 18:00.410
Naw.

18:00.477 --> 18:02.110
I mean,
if, if I wanted to be with y'all

18:02.177 --> 18:04.310
I coulda just stayed
in Brooklyn.

18:04.377 --> 18:06.677
Came out here
to recapture somethin'.

18:06.744 --> 18:09.210
I mean,
maybe I was little naive

18:09.277 --> 18:11.344
but over the years
I hung onto the belief

18:11.410 --> 18:13.310
that there was still a place

18:13.377 --> 18:17.144
where every little moment
was perfect.

18:17.210 --> 18:18.844
Well, listen,
I hate to bring you down

18:18.910 --> 18:20.844
but, since you're already
there..

18:22.777 --> 18:24.244
...it seems to me
that your Christmases

18:24.310 --> 18:26.044
were always a little lame.

18:26.110 --> 18:27.877
‐ Lame?
‐ 'Yeah!'

18:27.944 --> 18:31.644
Uncle Tibby puking on a manger?

18:31.710 --> 18:35.277
Cousin Margaret
singing those homicidal carols?

18:36.377 --> 18:37.977
Unwrappin' your training bra

18:38.044 --> 18:39.644
in front
of 15 hootin' cousins.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.144
Oh, oh, wait now.

18:41.210 --> 18:42.810
Ooh, that was
from my childhood.

18:46.477 --> 18:50.544
Alright, maybe I did have
a country‐ass Christmas. But..

18:52.077 --> 18:55.277
Why my memories
feel this sweet and nostalgic?

18:55.344 --> 18:57.410
I told you.

18:57.477 --> 19:00.517
You spent them
with people you love.

19:00.584 --> 19:02.250
So, you're sayin'
one day I'll look back

19:02.317 --> 19:05.184
on this sorry Christmas
with the same fuzzy feelin'?

19:06.784 --> 19:08.017
I hope so.

19:08.917 --> 19:09.950
Mistletoe.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.584
Hm, I'm looking forward
to remembering that one already.

19:16.784 --> 19:19.817
Overton? Obie, man, you alright?

19:19.884 --> 19:21.717
Yeah. I'm fine.

19:21.784 --> 19:24.750
Oh, I see the happy truce
is back in effect.

19:24.817 --> 19:28.117
No, not really.
But you know, after much debate

19:28.184 --> 19:30.284
Broom Hilda and I
came to the conclusion

19:30.350 --> 19:34.350
that it just takes
way too much energy to be nice.

19:34.417 --> 19:38.050
Yes, once Beelzebub and I
started criticizing

19:38.117 --> 19:40.417
each other's gifts
and calling each other name

19:40.484 --> 19:43.650
it kind of rekindled
that old flame, you know?

19:43.717 --> 19:46.250
Christmas miracles
keep on comin'.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.717
Oh. Okay.

19:48.384 --> 19:49.384
Khadijah.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.184
Let me chit and chat with ya.

19:56.050 --> 19:59.857
Listen, uh, I was somewhat
out of line earlier.

20:00.957 --> 20:02.890
Ah, forget it.

20:02.957 --> 20:06.057
Maybe I shouldn't have
mesmerized your man.

20:08.557 --> 20:10.490
You reeled in
an unemployed actor.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.490
Ooh, you really have power.

20:14.724 --> 20:18.490
I don't know how you people
run things in the States

20:18.557 --> 20:21.657
but up here we have
a little thing called respect.

20:21.724 --> 20:23.724
That fire? Illegal.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.724
Ah!

20:25.924 --> 20:27.857
Hey, just write me up, bro.

20:27.924 --> 20:30.090
Come on, man, have a heart.

20:30.157 --> 20:31.457
I have a heart, ma'am

20:31.524 --> 20:33.390
and it's right here
under this badge

20:33.457 --> 20:35.390
and it's hurting.

20:35.457 --> 20:38.524
My dinner date for
the RCMP Christmas Dinner Dance

20:38.590 --> 20:40.524
cancelled on me

20:40.590 --> 20:42.057
but if you'd accompany me
to said event

20:42.124 --> 20:44.324
perhaps I'd consider
downgrading this citation

20:44.390 --> 20:49.657
to a simple in the future..
Watch it.

20:49.724 --> 20:51.024
[chuckles]

20:51.090 --> 20:54.557
Sorry, but I got a date
with that rollercoaster

20:54.624 --> 20:57.524
but perhaps my friend, Regine,
here, would be interested.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.697
No, Khadijah,
I really don't think‐‐
