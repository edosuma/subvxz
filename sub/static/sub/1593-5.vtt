00:02.295 --> 00:06.880
Radio:
J‘ May the work I've done J‘

00:07.049 --> 00:10.291
J‘ Speak for me J‘

00:12.138 --> 00:16.131
J‘ May the work I've done... J‘

00:17.476 --> 00:19.307
It's getting
a little messy for you.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.309
J‘ Speak for me... J‘

00:21.480 --> 00:23.471
Getting ready for retirement.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.140
Relaxing the grooming
standards.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.560
Thinking about
becoming a plumber.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.478
A sheepherder,
or something.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.066
You ain't herding sheep now,
Abraham.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.481
Eyes on the prize.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.150
Damn right.

00:36.329 --> 00:38.991
That's my girl.

00:39.165 --> 00:42.328
Maybe I'll let you
shave me down all over,

00:42.501 --> 00:44.537
dolphin-smooth.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.998
( laughs)
l'll cut it for you tonight.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.379
Yes, ma'am.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.289
Hey, maybe Rosita

00:50.468 --> 00:52.379
can give you a trim
while she's at it.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.966
Party's getting
a little long in the back.

00:56.140 --> 00:59.132
Or is it your source of power?

00:59.310 --> 01:02.017
I ain't slaying a lion
anytime soon.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.928
I wouldn't be placing
any wagers on seeing me

01:04.106 --> 01:06.597
dispatch a thousand Philistines
with the jawbone of an ass.

01:06.776 --> 01:10.018
Tara: So you'll just settle
on saving the world, right?

01:10.196 --> 01:12.357
Eugene:
Yeah.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.527
What's up?

01:15.701 --> 01:19.114
- Last night?
- Nope.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.746
Yes. That and tomorrow.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.873
And I'm thinking
about that preacher,

01:25.044 --> 01:27.080
what he did.

01:32.134 --> 01:35.297
J‘ May the service I give J‘

01:35.471 --> 01:39.885
J‘ Speak for me... J‘

01:40.059 --> 01:42.926
Maybe they're just behind us.

01:43.104 --> 01:46.312
Maybe Daryl
and Carol came back.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.098
Maybe they took the map,
found some cars,

01:49.277 --> 01:50.892
and they're just down the road.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.651
They'll catch up.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.653
We're clearing the way for 'em.

01:57.243 --> 01:59.234
Maggie:
How long will it be?

01:59.412 --> 02:02.404
After you get on that terminal
and do what you have to do?

02:03.916 --> 02:05.247
Depends on a number of factors,

02:05.418 --> 02:06.874
including density of the infected

02:07.044 --> 02:09.421
around target sites worldwide.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.294
Wait, target sites?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.921
Are you talking
about missiles?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.675
That's classified.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.258
Glenn:
I thought we were over that.

02:19.432 --> 02:21.047
What if we all live?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.761
Glenn:
The secrets will matter then?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.017
They might.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.314
Anyway, the speed
with which things normalize

02:27.481 --> 02:28.687
depend on a number of factors,

02:28.858 --> 02:30.314
including worldwide
weather patterns,

02:30.484 --> 02:31.815
which were modeled
without the assumption

02:31.986 --> 02:33.851
that cars, planes,
boats, and trains

02:34.030 --> 02:35.520
wouldn't be pouring hydrocarbons

02:35.698 --> 02:37.313
into the atmosphere this long.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.027
Changed the game quite a bit

02:39.201 --> 02:41.453
when it comes to
air-transmissible pathogens.

02:45.374 --> 02:48.286
Why the hair?

02:48.461 --> 02:50.622
Because I like it.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.081
And no one is taking scissor

02:52.256 --> 02:53.757
or clipper to it anytime soon.

02:53.924 --> 02:54.959
Do you hear me,
Miss Espinoza?

02:55.134 --> 02:57.500
- Yes, loud and clear.
- ( group chuckles)

02:57.678 --> 02:58.838
Eugene:
Y'all can laugh all you want.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.549
Maggie:
No one was makin' fun.

03:00.723 --> 03:03.305
The smartest man I ever met
happened to love my hair.

03:03.476 --> 03:04.886
My old boss, T. Brooks Ellis,

03:05.061 --> 03:08.303
the director of
the Human Genome Project.

03:08.481 --> 03:09.641
He said my hair
made me look like,

03:09.815 --> 03:12.648
and | quote, "a fun guy,"

03:12.818 --> 03:15.230
which lam.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.488
ljust ain't Samson.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.694
-( loud bang )
-( brakes screeching )

03:36.300 --> 03:38.507
J‘ Speak for me J‘

03:38.677 --> 03:40.338
J‘ You remember this J‘

03:40.513 --> 03:45.348
J‘ The work I've done. J‘

03:45.518 --> 03:46.633
J‘ It speaks... J‘

03:46.811 --> 03:50.929
(snarling )

04:04.245 --> 04:07.578
(theme music playing )

04:43.576 --> 04:46.238
(faint gurgling)

04:49.957 --> 04:52.073
(faint gurgling)

04:54.170 --> 04:57.583
(gasping, gurgling)

05:04.346 --> 05:06.803
(gurgling)

05:10.436 --> 05:13.098
( squishes )

05:21.447 --> 05:23.529
Ellen...

05:25.993 --> 05:28.450
- Ellen!
- ( walkers snarling )

05:28.621 --> 05:29.861
( music on radio continues)

05:30.039 --> 05:32.121
Eugene!

05:34.126 --> 05:35.957
Eugene!

05:36.128 --> 05:38.210
Eugene, are you okay?

05:38.380 --> 05:41.042
The preacher...

05:41.217 --> 05:42.627
didn't see another way out.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.883
You hold on, okay?

05:45.054 --> 05:46.965
Everyone else, you all right?

05:47.139 --> 05:48.640
- Glenn: Yeah.
- Tara: Yes.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.308
Rosita: The engine's on fire.
We gotta get out of here.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.841
Abraham: I know.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.807
All right, you and | go first,
knock 'em back.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.348
Clear the way for Maggie
and Rosita to get out,

05:59.527 --> 06:01.188
then we all start
hitting them, okay?

06:01.362 --> 06:03.648
Yeah, all right.
We'll do it live.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.687
(walkers snarling )

06:05.866 --> 06:07.481
- Tara?
- Yeah?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.150
You cover Eugene.
You come out when it's clear.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.034
- Okay.
- On my go!

06:11.205 --> 06:13.241
Go!

06:23.509 --> 06:25.545
(walker snarling )

06:31.850 --> 06:34.262
Come on.
I know it sucks and it's scary,

06:34.436 --> 06:37.769
- but it's time to be brave.
- It isn't voluntary.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.680
It is when you're
screwed either way.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.723
So you gut through the choice
that might help somebody.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.357
Come on.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.697
I'm right behind you.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.580
(snarling continues)

07:13.976 --> 07:16.809
(walker snarling )

07:52.765 --> 07:54.505
Whew.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.596
Check Eugene.
See if he's hurt.

07:58.771 --> 08:00.602
I'm fine.
Just cuts and dings is all.

08:00.773 --> 08:02.263
Check him!

08:09.698 --> 08:13.111
- Eugene: Is that your blood?
- Yeah.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.367
Damn thing opened again.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.448
I swear, the cuts are finer
than frog's hair.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.617
They'rejust big bleeders.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.956
Maggie:
First aid kit's in the bus.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.961
I'll see what we have.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.623
(rumbling)

08:37.643 --> 08:41.477
We're not stopping.
We're rolling on.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.684
We'll find another vehicle
down the road.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.644
The mission hasn't changed.

08:46.819 --> 08:47.854
Devil's advocate, nothing more.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.689
We smashed to a stop hard.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.479
We spent a lot of time
rolling things out of the road.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.989
The church isjust
15 miles back that way--

08:54.159 --> 08:56.992
No. We don't stop.
We don't go back.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.244
We're at war,
and retreat means we lose.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.155
The road fights back,
the plan gets jacked.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.324
You all know that.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.328
Now, we will get through this
because we have to.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.872
Every direction is a question.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.668
We don't go back!

09:13.846 --> 09:16.007
Hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

09:16.181 --> 09:18.558
lam fit as a damn fiddle.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.512
We are going with you.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.723
You are calling this thing.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.689
ljust need to know
you're good.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.936
This is how things stop.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.776
I can't afford that right now.
The world can't afford it.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.902
Listen, I took a pretty hard shot
to the sack with that crash.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.867
I am stressed and depressed
to see that ride die,

09:43.041 --> 09:44.702
but if you say we're rolling on,

09:44.877 --> 09:47.243
I'm good.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.211
We're rolling on.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.546
I'm gonna rub some dirt on it
and walk it off.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.552
Yeah.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.384
Rosita: We'll find what we need
like we always have--

09:59.558 --> 10:02.220
- on the way.
- Okay.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.635
I'm not rubbing dirt
on anything.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.395
Maybe we can find some bikes.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.227
Bikes don't burn.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.325
All right.

10:17.493 --> 10:18.778
Right.

10:31.507 --> 10:34.089
Rosita:
Eugene, what are you doing?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.420
Nothing.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.469
Rosita:
Let's go.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.573
Ellen!

11:06.208 --> 11:07.664
Ell...?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.791
Ellen?

11:15.968 --> 11:18.550
- ( faint dripping)
- Ellen.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.308
( crickets chirping )

11:34.736 --> 11:36.442
Let's go.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.166
( door creaks)

12:01.763 --> 12:04.755
(Abraham humming)

12:24.286 --> 12:27.995
J‘ ...speak for me... J‘

12:28.165 --> 12:31.532
(humming continues)

13:17.798 --> 13:21.086
(humming continues)

13:24.721 --> 13:27.963
J‘ May the work I've done J‘

13:28.141 --> 13:31.304
J‘ Speak for me... J‘

13:31.478 --> 13:34.265
( crickets chirping )

13:54.626 --> 13:56.207
I'm gonna take a sweep.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.994
Okay.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.347
(thudding)

14:29.327 --> 14:30.578
Hey.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.828
Hey.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.205
Thank you.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.537
( chuckles )
For what?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.829
Showing up.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.838
It took a little horse trading
to get you here,

14:44.009 --> 14:48.673
but it's plain
as potatoes to me now.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.758
You get it.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.014
You could have lit out
after the crash, made a case.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.265
But you stayed.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.348
- I made a deal.
- Yeah, you could've broke it.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.514
(sniffs)
What was I gonna do?

15:02.861 --> 15:05.443
You gonna put that thing
away tonight?

15:10.952 --> 15:13.113
How about that?
You gonna wrap that up?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.279
No, I'm gonna
let it get some air.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.913
Got cut up
pretty ugly last night

15:17.084 --> 15:20.451
back at the church.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.041
Yeah.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.669
Gotten to the point
where everyone alive

15:30.847 --> 15:32.223
is strong now.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.015
We have to be.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.175
You're either strong

15:37.354 --> 15:38.719
and they can help you,
so you help them,

15:38.897 --> 15:42.890
or you're strong
and they can kill ya.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.820
So you gotta kill them.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.322
You gotta kill them and...

15:59.251 --> 16:00.912
(sighs)

16:01.086 --> 16:04.670
I want to say it's never easy.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.799
That's not the truth.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.427
It's the easiest thing
in the world now.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.858
The world's gonna change, right?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.616
You're damn right it's gonna.

16:38.039 --> 16:41.167
You'd better turn in.
You got late watch.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.167
Yeah.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.007
I really need some ass first.

16:53.430 --> 16:57.298
Didn't need to know that,
but, cool.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.805
( panting )

17:04.983 --> 17:06.723
Abraham!

17:06.902 --> 17:08.233
He's watching again.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.236
Over there in
the self-help section.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.864
( both laugh )

17:15.035 --> 17:18.152
- Abraham: "Self-help."
-( both laughing)

17:20.332 --> 17:22.163
Abraham:
Don't worry about him, baby.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.325
He's harmless.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.708
-( Rosita moans )
- Come on.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.835
( Rosita moaning )

17:28.006 --> 17:29.997
Dude.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.923
Cards on the table.
l was watching them.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.712
Yeah, I saw that.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.847
I believe they know
I catch an eyeful on occasion,

17:40.018 --> 17:42.885
which isn't to say it's their thing.
It's not mine either.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.519
It's just that I enjoy
the female form

17:44.689 --> 17:46.190
and I consider this
a victimless crime

17:46.358 --> 17:48.349
that provides both
comfort and distraction.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.359
(moaning continues)

17:51.529 --> 17:55.021
Maybe, uh-- maybe we can
move on from here.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.191
l was looking for you
to say thank you

17:57.369 --> 17:58.700
for having my back
at the bus.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.033
You saved my life.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.619
- Don't know about that.
- You did.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.875
Well, if I did,
then you provided the context

18:07.045 --> 18:08.330
for me doing so.

18:08.505 --> 18:09.915
- What?
- l was screwed either way,

18:10.090 --> 18:12.376
so I went with the choice
that helped someone.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.461
I thought it trite,
but it turned out to be true.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.968
- Point to you.
- You have this.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.801
Even if you didn't before, you do.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.137
Look, I'm--
I'm the same way.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.302
You know you can do this.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.892
Uh, did you hear
what I just said?

18:32.070 --> 18:34.777
The bus crashed
'cause of me.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.940
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.155
I put crushed glass
in the fuel line.

18:41.329 --> 18:44.571
Light bulbs I found
in the church.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.616
The vehicle should've failed

18:47.794 --> 18:48.783
before it ever got to the road.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.247
You would've killed us.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.457
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.746
Not hardly, not half.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.256
The glass wasn't supposed
to wear out the fuel line

18:55.427 --> 18:57.418
next to the spark plugs.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.301
We fully pulled
a short straw on that one.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.430
What the hell?
Why did you do that?

19:03.685 --> 19:08.270
Eugene, why did--
Eugene?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.931
Why did you do that?

19:12.777 --> 19:15.439
- Um...
- Answer me.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.943
I appreciate
the positive affirmations

19:19.117 --> 19:21.199
and looking the other way
on the perversion,

19:21.369 --> 19:23.360
but I know empirically
and definitively

19:23.538 --> 19:24.869
that I cannot survive
on my own.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.452
-|cannot
- So you killed the bus?

19:30.045 --> 19:32.832
If I don't cure the disease,

19:33.006 --> 19:35.372
if I don't save the world,
l have no value.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.132
- That's not how it works.
- If I don't fix things,

19:38.303 --> 19:40.464
there's no way you people
would keep me around,

19:40.638 --> 19:42.720
share resources,
even protect me.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.677
Of course we would.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.308
We're friends.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.391
We have each other's backs.
That's it.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.180
That's how it works.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.853
Don't tell anyone else
what you did.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.068
I'll keep your secret
and we'll keep going.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.153
You know you messed up.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.990
You're trying, but, dude,

20:06.164 --> 20:08.997
you can't do something
like that again.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.873
I won't.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.996
You're stuck with us.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.664
Just like we're stuck with you,

20:17.842 --> 20:20.049
no matter what.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.586
I don't know why I told you.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.345
I do.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.677
(soft laugh )

20:26.851 --> 20:29.342
Welcome to the human race,
asshole.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.647
Come on.
It's getting late.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.532
( panting, moaning increases)

20:48.706 --> 20:49.957
(sighs)

20:56.214 --> 20:59.456
You thinking about them?

20:59.634 --> 21:01.249
Yeah.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.798
lfeel guilty.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.300
Hey.

21:13.898 --> 21:18.267
Hey, we get to have...

21:18.445 --> 21:23.064
little vacations
on bookstore floors.

21:28.079 --> 21:32.322
We're not back there anymore.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.161
We're living for something else.

21:34.335 --> 21:38.624
And they don't get to right now.

21:38.798 --> 21:43.588
Well, we did almost die today.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.252
And we don't have a car.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.422
And we're drinking toilet water.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.938
ltjust feels really good
having this...

21:59.277 --> 22:01.939
because it's not about what was.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.443
Not last night.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.444
It's all about what's gonna be.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.123
Don't feel guilty about that.

23:07.345 --> 23:08.960
Ellen.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.345
You're safe now.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.892
I stopped 'em.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.524
You don't have to be
scared now.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.418
Hey--

23:49.387 --> 23:51.469
It's okay.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.721
It's not infected.

24:00.898 --> 24:04.766
You been going to
nursing school on the sly?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.684
Roger and Pam taught me.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.187
Mm.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.241
I think we should
stay here today.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.119
No.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.155
You got some reading
you need to catch up on?

24:19.334 --> 24:22.041
We got lucky yesterday.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.418
But we're all banged up,
you especially.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.420
We've been through worse.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.673
We keep moving.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.084
Maybe we always wind up stopping

24:31.262 --> 24:33.093
because we never start at 100%.

24:33.264 --> 24:34.925
Every minute we waste
getting him to Washington,

24:35.099 --> 24:36.430
people are dying.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.933
You think I don't
understand that?

24:39.103 --> 24:40.263
After everything?

24:42.273 --> 24:45.606
You see, I want us
to actually get there.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.438
No, you want us
to sit around.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.523
You want us to stop.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.944
( scoffs )

24:56.621 --> 24:58.782
Maggie:
This town isn't in bad shape.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.948
This store wasn't even touched.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.162
We could make
a good base here.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.127
We could spend one last day
doing a sweep for supplies.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.337
We'll sweep as we go.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.501
We've done it since Houston.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.965
We're not stopping now.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.134
You heard the lady.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.973
We're taking it north.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.229
Tara:
We tapped out the toilet.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.812
Broad River
is five miles west.

25:27.985 --> 25:28.974
At the very least,

25:29.153 --> 25:31.360
we stock up there
before we find wheels.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.146
We got a vehicle.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.243
And itjust so happens...

25:38.413 --> 25:41.325
it's got 500 gallons
of water on it.

26:05.356 --> 26:07.062
(grunts)

26:08.568 --> 26:10.775
(humming)

26:13.906 --> 26:16.943
(engine whirring)

26:21.873 --> 26:25.582
(engine starts)

26:25.752 --> 26:27.708
( laughs)

26:27.879 --> 26:30.791
About time things
started going our way!

26:49.901 --> 26:53.735
(engine stops)

26:55.072 --> 26:57.279
Come on.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.906
Just once.

26:59.076 --> 27:02.739
Just one damn time.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.035
We'll find another ride.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.198
If there was a ride
worth a shit in this town,

27:07.376 --> 27:08.832
we'd have seen it.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.494
This thing's done
some crowd clearing.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.458
Right up into the intake.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.713
Which means we've got an air filter

27:14.884 --> 27:16.966
filled with
damn human remains.

27:18.805 --> 27:22.798
There is no damned corner
on this damned Earth

27:22.975 --> 27:26.092
that has not been dicked hard

27:26.270 --> 27:28.261
beyond all damned recognition.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.816
- Abraham?
- What?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.393
That feeds the radiator.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.775
The intake for the engine
is actually on the roof.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.532
(tire thumps)

27:49.126 --> 27:52.539
(snarling )

27:52.713 --> 27:54.624
Tara! Maggie!

27:54.799 --> 27:57.541
One damn town!

27:59.637 --> 28:03.050
- One damn town!
- Rosita: Abraham, just wait!

28:03.224 --> 28:06.512
(snarling continues)

28:06.686 --> 28:08.847
There's more from the back!

28:23.578 --> 28:25.239
(growling)

28:49.061 --> 28:51.097
(faint growling)

28:51.272 --> 28:53.513
I been to eight county fairs

28:53.691 --> 28:56.182
and one goat rodeo.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.851
I never seen anything like that.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.199
There was a Goodwill
over there by the bookstore.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.485
It's pretty blown up,
but there might be some supplies,

29:07.663 --> 29:09.073
some dry clothes, maybe?

29:09.248 --> 29:11.204
Not necessary.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.538
I can clear that intake
in two shakes.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.078
Then the engine
will get some wind

29:17.256 --> 29:19.121
and so will we.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.211
You'll air-dry.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.467
We roll on.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.554
(laughing)

29:39.070 --> 29:40.731
What?

29:40.905 --> 29:43.146
This shit is screwed up!

29:43.324 --> 29:45.565
(laughing)

30:03.010 --> 30:05.251
( gasps )

30:09.350 --> 30:11.011
Ellen?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.764
AJ?

30:14.939 --> 30:17.021
Becca?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.609
(yells)
Ellen!

30:29.120 --> 30:31.611
Ellen!

30:31.789 --> 30:33.495
(humming)

30:34.709 --> 30:37.701
- ( clanking )
- Come on.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.620
(humming continues)

30:44.010 --> 30:47.218
( clanking continues)

31:12.163 --> 31:14.370
I know why
you have the haircut.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.246
I told you,
it's 'cause I like it.

31:16.417 --> 31:19.329
I believe that.
I like it, too.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.919
I think you like it for a reason.

31:25.843 --> 31:30.177
You're not the person
people think you are.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.178
You want 'em
to know who you are.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.097
Not following you.

31:38.272 --> 31:39.728
If you didn't have
that mullet,

31:39.899 --> 31:42.857
you'd probably be like
everybody else in the labs.

31:43.027 --> 31:47.020
But you're not
like everybody else.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.563
I think a lot of people
in your position

31:48.741 --> 31:50.732
probably would've given up,

31:50.910 --> 31:52.366
but you didn't.

31:52.536 --> 31:56.028
There were people--
a lot of them along the way--

31:56.207 --> 31:57.868
they made sure I didn't give up.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.748
It wasn't me remotely.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.535
It was.

32:02.713 --> 32:05.580
You started this thing.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.921
And you're not like Samson.
He was kind of a mess.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.801
Not following you.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.633
Well, his story goes...

32:13.808 --> 32:16.094
that one day
when a lion attacked him,

32:16.268 --> 32:18.930
God gave him strength
and he tore it apart.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.391
Then he goes back one day,
he's by himself,

32:21.565 --> 32:25.478
and he sees that bees have made
a hive in the carcass.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.735
So later he tells
this riddle to people.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.987
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.

32:30.157 --> 32:34.275
Out of the strong,
something sweet."

32:34.453 --> 32:36.409
And | always thought,

32:36.580 --> 32:39.913
how the hell are people
supposed to know the answer

32:40.084 --> 32:41.949
when it's just
about his own life?

32:42.128 --> 32:45.916
When the only place the answer is
is in his own head?

32:46.090 --> 32:48.297
Glenn:
Whoa, what the hell is that?

32:50.678 --> 32:52.134
What?

32:52.304 --> 32:54.420
Wind's picking up.
You're about to smell it.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.759
- ( all groan )
- Maggie: What is that?

32:56.934 --> 32:59.175
Whatever's making that stench,

32:59.353 --> 33:01.639
it ain't nothing nice.

33:04.942 --> 33:06.182
We're not stopping.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.022
Uh, we're stopped.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.368
(wind rustling)

33:39.727 --> 33:42.639
(coughs)

34:02.833 --> 34:05.575
Let's go
We're gonna go.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.334
Abraham:
lwill not lie down.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.496
Abraham.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.255
( softly )
I will not abase.

34:12.426 --> 34:15.213
Abraham, let's get out of here.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.003
I will not give up the ship.

34:21.185 --> 34:23.176
( normal volume)
Hold up.

34:23.354 --> 34:26.846
- Maggie: We gotta go.
- No.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.436
No, we don't.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.022
They can't hear us
and they can't see us.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.561
Not from here.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.604
We're fine.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.899
Tara: Yeah, this is
the definition of fine.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.863
Glenn: We need the map.
There's gotta be a detour.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.993
Not doing it.

34:42.164 --> 34:44.200
We detoured and detoured and detoured
from Houston to Georgia.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.582
I'm not playing
that game anymore.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.368
We are not going
through this, okay?

34:49.546 --> 34:50.877
It isn't gonna happen.

34:51.048 --> 34:52.379
You got a shitstorm
behind doorA

34:52.549 --> 34:54.710
and a storm of shit
behind door B.

34:54.885 --> 34:58.127
If you're lucky,
it's walkers or a shot-up truck.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.387
But sooner or later
you get cornered.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.424
You wind up staying
and you wind up killing.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.220
We don't go back.
We can't go back.

35:07.398 --> 35:09.309
I'm not talking
about going back.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.099
- Just south a few miles.
- No.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.438
Eugene:
We already hit a full stop

35:13.612 --> 35:17.230
'cause of an air filter
compromised by innards.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.443
That will happen again.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.232
Then we'll hit 'em with the hose.

35:20.411 --> 35:22.993
Rosita:
The tank is empty, Abraham.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.824
- If we floor it--
- We still hit them,

35:24.999 --> 35:26.990
they still slow us down,
and then they stop us.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.498
I'm not saying
we just go straight.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.000
That's the way the road goes.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.752
- Abraham.
- We can get through!

35:32.923 --> 35:34.163
I know it!

35:35.801 --> 35:37.416
And that means
we are not going south,

35:37.594 --> 35:40.256
going around, or going back!

35:40.431 --> 35:42.672
Rosita: No.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.984
- Rosita: Abraham.
- Glenn: Hey! Hey!

36:04.163 --> 36:06.370
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Glenn: Let go of him.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.825
Rosita:
I'm not gonna let you do this.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.706
- Yes, you are.
- Hey, hey, stop.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.833
Hey, you are done!
You're done!

36:12.004 --> 36:13.540
- Do not! Do not!
- Stop!

36:13.714 --> 36:17.172
I told you, you do not touch me!
You do not touch me!

36:17.343 --> 36:21.052
- Abraham!
- ( all shouting)

36:21.221 --> 36:22.301
Rosita:
Abraham!

36:22.473 --> 36:23.508
I'm not a scientist!

36:23.682 --> 36:26.469
I'm not a scientist!

36:29.563 --> 36:30.973
I lied.

36:32.649 --> 36:33.638
I'm not a scientist.

36:36.487 --> 36:39.149
I don't know how to stop it.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.484
I'm not a scientist.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.053
Rosita:
You are a scientist.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.223
I've seen the things
that you can do.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.518
ljust know things.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.359
You just... know things?

37:23.534 --> 37:26.776
I know I'm smarter
than most people,

37:26.954 --> 37:28.069
I know I'm a very good liar,

37:28.247 --> 37:30.363
and I know I needed
to get to DC.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.582
Why?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.162
Because I do believe that locale

37:35.337 --> 37:36.873
holds the strongest
possibility for survival,

37:37.047 --> 37:40.039
and I wanted to survive.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.048
If I could cheat some people
into taking me there,

37:42.219 --> 37:46.212
well, ljust reasoned that
I'd be doing them a solid, too,

37:46.390 --> 37:48.130
considering the perilous state
of the city of Houston,

37:48.308 --> 37:50.264
the state of everything.

37:58.527 --> 38:02.236
People died
trying to get you here.

38:02.406 --> 38:04.567
I'm aware of that--

38:04.741 --> 38:09.075
Stephanie, Warren, Pam,

38:09.246 --> 38:13.410
Rex, Roger, Josiah,
Dirk, and Josephine.

38:15.252 --> 38:17.584
And Bob.

38:19.756 --> 38:22.463
You see, I lost my nerve
as we grew closer,

38:22.634 --> 38:25.626
(voice breaks )
for I am a coward...

38:25.804 --> 38:28.295
and the reality of
getting to our destination

38:28.474 --> 38:29.634
and disclosing
the truth of the matter

38:29.808 --> 38:32.424
became some
truly frightening shit.

38:32.603 --> 38:34.844
I took it upon myself
to slow our roll...

38:37.107 --> 38:39.849
find time to finesse things,
so then when we got there...

38:42.988 --> 38:44.353
But at this moment,
I fully realize

38:44.531 --> 38:46.613
there are no longer
any agreeable options.

38:48.869 --> 38:51.110
l was screwed either way.

38:57.711 --> 38:59.542
I also lied about T. Brooks Ellis
liking my hair.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.624
I do not know T. Brooks Ellis.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.959
But I did read one of his books,
and he seemed like

39:04.134 --> 39:05.590
the type of guy
that wouldn't blink twice

39:05.761 --> 39:07.001
at a Tennessee Top Hat.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.884
Again...

39:15.062 --> 39:16.848
I am smarter than you.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.057
Now, you may want
to leave me here--

39:18.232 --> 39:19.642
- ( gun clatters)
- ( grunts)

39:19.816 --> 39:21.727
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, come on!

39:21.902 --> 39:24.985
- Get off of him!
-( roars)

39:26.657 --> 39:29.364
- Maggie: Oh, my God.
- Glenn: No.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.910
Maggie:
Eugene?

39:51.557 --> 39:54.173
Get up.
Look at me.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.845
Oh, my God.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.017
Oh, God.
Eugene, are you there?

40:07.364 --> 40:09.025
Eugene!

40:09.199 --> 40:10.780
Eugene!

40:23.380 --> 40:25.041
Come on!

40:26.049 --> 40:28.426
Abraham:
Ellen.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.002
Eugene:
Help me!

41:10.177 --> 41:11.758
(snarling, growling)

41:11.928 --> 41:14.590
Help!
Help me!

41:17.976 --> 41:20.012
(whimpers)

41:20.187 --> 41:22.018
Help me, please!

41:23.106 --> 41:24.937
Get them.
Get 'em!

41:25.108 --> 41:27.360
(growling)

41:30.947 --> 41:34.485
Get them.
Get 'em.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.026
Thank you.

41:37.204 --> 41:38.819
Thank you.

41:38.997 --> 41:43.286
|think-- I think they're
getting faster.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.792
Wait!

41:45.962 --> 41:47.702
Wait up!

41:50.008 --> 41:51.293
Stop!

41:51.468 --> 41:55.211
- You can't leave!
- Why?

42:01.561 --> 42:04.303
l have a very
important mission.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.991
