15:45.145 --> 15:47.314
- MR. BOHANNON,
YOUR, UH,

15:47.347 --> 15:49.616
YOUR COMPANION
LOOKS UNWELL.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.152
- YEAH, I TOLD HIM
NOT TO RUN.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.221
WHISKEY!

15:59.792 --> 16:03.563
TIME FOR A LITTLE TALK.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.271
- NOW, I GOT 3,000 WORKERS
TO FEED.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.240
YOU GOT MY CATTLE.
I WANT IT BACK.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.576
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.445
- YOU HIRED SOME MEN
TO KILL MY PEN CREW

16:18.478 --> 16:20.647
AND RUSTLE MY CATTLE.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.117
- THOSE ARE
VERY SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS

16:24.151 --> 16:25.452
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,
BOHANNON.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.320
- SEE, 'CAUSE I FIGURE
YOU CANCELLED

16:27.354 --> 16:31.124
THE RAILROAD'S BEEF CONTRACTS,
AND THEN YOU DID THIS.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.459
YOU'RE TRYING
TO STARVE US OUT.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.128
- I CANCELLED
THE RAILROAD CONTRACTS

16:35.162 --> 16:37.530
BECAUSE I AM NO LONGER
IN A POSITION TO SELL BEEF

16:37.564 --> 16:39.666
TO THE RAILROAD.

16:42.235 --> 16:46.273
ALTHOUGH,
THROUGH SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES,

16:46.306 --> 16:50.243
I CAN BROKER A PRICE
OF $28 A HEAD.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.811
- [scoffs]

16:51.844 --> 16:54.447
SHIT, I WOULDN'T BUY FROM YOU
FOR A NICKEL A HEAD.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.149
- MR. DURANT.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.218
- SHERIFF.
- WHO SHOT BUBBA WADE?

16:58.251 --> 17:00.620
- YEAH, I DID.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.090
MM, DURANT HIRED HIM
AND SOME OTHERS

17:03.123 --> 17:04.757
TO KILL A U.P. CREW
AND RUSTLE MY CATTLE,

17:04.791 --> 17:06.259
AND I WANT 'EM BACK.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.395
- YOU GOT PROOF?

17:08.428 --> 17:11.298
- THIS ONE HERE,
HE'S A WITNESS.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.333
- THE JUDGE OF THIS TOWN
PREFERS HIS WITNESSES

17:13.366 --> 17:14.667
TO BE OF THE BREATHING KIND.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.203
- [chuckles]

17:16.236 --> 17:20.373
SHERIFF, THIS--
THIS IS MR. CULLEN BOHANNON.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.375
HE IS THE NEW HEAD

17:22.409 --> 17:25.678
OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.847
HE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST
HIS CATTLE

17:27.880 --> 17:30.283
AND IS
UNDER THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION

17:30.317 --> 17:31.618
THAT I AM
SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.587
- HE DID THE RUSTLING.
HE DID THE HIRING.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.257
- MR. DURANT AIN'T LEFT TOWN
IN THREE DAYS.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.726
NOW, BUBBA HERE
WAS WANTED FOR RUSTLING,

17:39.759 --> 17:41.594
AND RUSTLING'S
A HANGING CRIME.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.664
COME SEE ME
IF YOU WANT YOUR REWARD.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.566
NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.737
THEN CLEAR OUT.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.140
- THANK YOU, SHERIFF.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.614
HOW DARE YOU COME IN HERE
AND MAKE THESE ACCUSATIONS?

18:01.648 --> 18:05.252
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THESE PURPORTED MURDERS

18:05.285 --> 18:07.587
AND THIEVERY.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.123
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

18:10.157 --> 18:11.691
- YOU'RE CAPABLE.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.727
- YOU OVERESTIMATE ME,
BOHANNON.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.429
- [chuckles]
WHAT--

18:16.463 --> 18:18.298
ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE, THEN?

18:18.331 --> 18:21.268
- I AM A BUSINESSMAN
BUILDING A RAILROAD HUB

18:21.301 --> 18:24.837
OUT HERE ON THE PRAIRIE.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.107
NOW GET THIS CORPSE
AWAY FROM MY TABLE.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.647
- THIS AIN'T OVER.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.750
- INDEED IT IS NOT.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.890
AH, THANK YOU.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.859
[clears throat]

19:06.846 --> 19:10.383
- GOT TO TELEGRAPH THE FORT,
CALL OFF BENDIX.

19:10.417 --> 19:14.187
- LIKE PUTTING A MAD DOG
BACK ON A CHAIN.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.625
- MR. BOHANNON.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.859
MAGGIE PALMER.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.362
I OWN THE CIRCLE P RANCH.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.730
QUITE A SPECTACLE
IN THERE.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.598
- SORRY TO RUIN
YOUR SUPPER, MA'AM.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.866
- MM, THAT WAS
THE MOST ENTERTAINMENT

19:26.899 --> 19:28.635
WE'VE HAD AROUND HERE
FOR WEEKS.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.703
I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.705
- OBLIGED.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.241
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.708
- I CAN OFFER YOU
ALL THE CATTLE YOU NEED

19:35.742 --> 19:38.578
FOR YOUR RAILROAD,
$25 A HEAD.

19:38.611 --> 19:43.483
- NO OFFENSE, MA'AM, BUT I KNOW
WHAT MARKET PRIME IS.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.984
KIND OF VOLUME I'M LOOKING FOR,
YOU OUGHT TO OFFER ME

19:45.017 --> 19:47.954
A QUARTER OVER PRIME,
FIXED RATE, FOR THREE YEARS.

19:47.987 --> 19:51.791
- 75¢ OVER PRIME,
TWO YEARS.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.661
- 50¢ OVER PRIME,
THREE YEARS,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.597
OR END OF PROJECT,
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.

19:59.766 --> 20:04.237
- DONE.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.972
- WHY, UH,

20:06.005 --> 20:08.341
WHY ARE YOU OFFERING ME A DEAL
THAT MIGHT COST YOU LATER?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.477
- OH, I'VE MADE
THE BETTER DEAL, MR. BOHANNON.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.312
THERE'S A RANGE WAR COMING,

20:12.345 --> 20:13.680
AND YOUR RAILROAD
IS ABOUT TO DRIVE

20:13.713 --> 20:15.682
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.685
GOOD DAY.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.627
- YOU SAVED THAT GIRL'S LIFE.
- YEAH.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.763
- HERE.
[baby coos]

20:33.666 --> 20:37.236
- MM.
MAYBE FOR THE TIME BEING.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.878
- HOW DID YOU SURVIVE

20:45.912 --> 20:48.881
THE LIFE
OF A PROSTITUTE?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.617
- [sighs]
I WAS LUCKY.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.786
THE WHORING BUSINESS
WASN'T TOO GOOD FOR ME.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.556
YOU KNOW, WHITE MEN
THOUGHT I WAS DIRTY

20:56.589 --> 20:58.658
'CAUSE I'D LIVED
WITH THE INDIANS,

20:58.691 --> 21:01.294
SO I COULD ONLY CHARGE
CUT RATE.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.962
[chuckles]
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.433
IF YOU WANTED ME,
I WOULD GIVE YOU A BIG RIDE.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.937
BUT JUST NOT THAT MANY
WANTED ME.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.439
EXCEPT FOR MR. FERGUSON.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.408
[baby whimpers]

21:15.442 --> 21:16.809
- AND YOUR LATE HUSBAND?

21:16.843 --> 21:20.513
- YEAH.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.683
- I'VE HEARD THE STORY.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.085
- I RECKON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

21:26.118 --> 21:29.822
IT'S HOW COME
I SURVIVED IT.

21:29.856 --> 21:34.093
- WELL, THEY BOTH LOVED YOU.

21:34.126 --> 21:38.565
- THEY SAY NEVER
FALL IN LOVE WITH A WHORE.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.601
IT ALWAYS ENDS BAD.

21:43.770 --> 21:48.107
LIKE MR. TOOLE.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.742
YOU KNOW, I--

21:49.776 --> 21:53.446
I'M THE REASON HE'S DEAD.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.716
AIN'T NO TWO WAYS
ABOUT IT.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.790
I'VE PUT A CURSE
ON EVERYTHING.

22:07.627 --> 22:13.633
[indistinct chatter]

22:20.907 --> 22:24.076
[knock at door]
[baby crying]

22:26.946 --> 22:29.782
WHO IS IT?

22:29.816 --> 22:32.519
- DECLAN TOOLE.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.955
GREGORY'S BROTHER.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.558
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.827
- A WORD, MA'AM.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.863
- SO THE CURSE
HAS COME CALLING.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.810
NOW AIN'T A GOOD TIME.

22:57.844 --> 23:02.148
- I'VE COME A LONG WAY.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.818
DID YOU NOT GET MY LETTER
STATING MY INTENTIONS?

23:05.852 --> 23:08.721
- IT WAS READ TO ME, BUT...

23:08.755 --> 23:12.091
I CAN'T MARRY SOMEBODY
I AIN'T EVER MET BEFORE.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.663
- IT'S OUR CUSTOM

23:16.696 --> 23:19.666
TO MARRY
MY BROTHER'S WIDOW,

23:19.699 --> 23:22.535
BECOME A FATHER
TO HIS CHILD.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.606
- IT'S NOT MY CUSTOM.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.642
- MAY I AT LEAST SEE
MY NIECE?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.750
- SHE--SHE'S SLEEPING.

23:37.784 --> 23:41.821
[baby crying]

23:44.657 --> 23:47.860
AND I DON'T OPEN THE DOOR
TO STRANGERS AFTER DARK.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.897
- I'M NOT A STRANGER.

23:52.565 --> 23:56.202
I'M YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.604
[crying continues]

23:57.637 --> 24:00.006
- PLEASE GO AWAY,
MR. TOOLE.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.042
DON'T BE COMING AROUND HERE
NO MORE.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.661
[birds calling]

24:21.694 --> 24:24.931
- HOW BAD IS IT,
MR. ANDERSON?

24:27.266 --> 24:30.069
- OH, AXLE'S NEARLY SHEARED
IN TWO.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.104
- CAN YOU REPAIR IT?
- YEAH.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.641
WE'LL HAVE TO REMOVE EVERYTHING
FROM THE WAGON

24:34.674 --> 24:37.577
TO LIGHTEN IT, EH?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.846
THEN I CAN CUT THE SAPLING
AND REPLACE THE AXLE

24:39.879 --> 24:42.582
UNTIL WE GET
TO THE OUTPOST.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.852
- YOU CAN FIX IT
OUT HERE?

24:45.885 --> 24:48.287
- YEAH.
[chuckles]

24:48.320 --> 24:50.890
I CAN FIX MOST THINGS, SON.

24:50.923 --> 24:54.026
YOU KNOW, IN MILWAUKEE,
I WORKED IN A GRANARY.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.728
I WAS IN CHARGE
OF MAINTENANCE.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.664
- ALL MY DAD DOES IS READ.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.865
- BOOKS ARE IMPORTANT.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.800
YOU'D BE WISE
TO LEARN THAT.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.870
- HMM.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.271
- HOW LONG, MR. ANDERSON?

25:05.304 --> 25:08.608
- OH, A FEW HOURS.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.677
- THANK THE LORD
WE CAME UPON YOU.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.279
- NO, NO, NO.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.983
IT IS I
WHO MUST THANK YOU.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.853
WHEN THE INDIANS
ATTACKED MY FAMILY,

25:20.887 --> 25:24.624
I LOST MY WIFE,
MY CHILD,

25:24.657 --> 25:26.893
AND I DID NOT--

25:26.926 --> 25:29.696
DID NOT THINK
I COULD CARRY ON.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.264
BUT...

25:32.298 --> 25:35.267
GOD SENT ME
YOU GOOD PEOPLE,

25:35.301 --> 25:38.270
AND YOU HAVE GAVE ME

25:38.304 --> 25:42.742
FOOD AND SHELTER.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.343
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE

25:44.376 --> 25:47.580
TO LOSE YOUR FAMILY.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.553
- [voice shaking]
I LOVED THEM S-SO MUCH.

25:56.388 --> 26:00.660
I MISS THEM,
ESPECIALLY MY BOY.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.195
- YOUR FAMILY
IS WITH GOD NOW.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.197
- AH, YEAH, YEAH.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.799
[sniffles]

26:06.833 --> 26:08.367
YEAH.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.871
THEY ARE ANGELS NOW, EH?
YEAH.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.742
AS SOMEDAY
WE ALL WILL BE.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.145
SO...

26:19.178 --> 26:21.914
YOUNG SAPLING.
EZRA, EH?

26:21.948 --> 26:24.951
CAN YOU CUT A TREE DOWN
FOR OUR, UH,

26:24.984 --> 26:26.152
OUR AXLE, HUH?

26:26.185 --> 26:27.687
- YEAH.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.023
- [laughing]

26:31.057 --> 26:34.727
[bell clanging,
train horn blows]

26:38.731 --> 26:41.033
- THE CUT CREWS HAVE POSTED
STRIKE NOTICES

26:41.067 --> 26:42.635
ABOUT THE HALF RATIONS.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.704
- TAKE IT DOWN

26:44.737 --> 26:48.007

PER YOUR DIRE TELEGRAM
FOR ASSISTANCE.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.851
- I SENT YOU
A SECOND TELEGRAM.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.886
WASN'T INDIANS THAT DID THIS.
IT WAS WHITE MEN.

28:06.919 --> 28:09.155
- YOU SHOULD SEE
THESE SPECIMENS I GOT.

28:09.188 --> 28:13.993
- SOMETHING REALLY WRONG
WITH YOU.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.795
- MAYBE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

28:15.828 --> 28:19.732
- I UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY, SIR.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.934
I CARRIED OUT YOUR ORIGINAL

28:21.968 --> 28:24.971
"PURSUE AND KILL THE INDIANS,
NO MERCY."

28:27.239 --> 28:29.341
- I REDACTED THEM ORDERS.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.844
- HOWEVER,

28:31.878 --> 28:33.780
YOUR ORIGINAL REQUEST CONFORMED

28:33.813 --> 28:38.450

WE ARE AT WAR

JUST AS WE WERE AT WAR

28:52.932 --> 28:56.268
ON THE PRETENSE OF PROTECTING
THE UNION PACIFIC.

28:56.302 --> 29:00.406

[indistinct chatter]

29:40.279 --> 29:43.282
- THAT WOMAN PUT UP
MUCH OF A FIGHT?

29:47.386 --> 29:50.857
- I HONESTLY CAN'T RECALL.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.396
- IT'S MARKED UP ARAPAHO.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.398
THEY'LL COME AT US NOW.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.600
PICK OFF MY OUTLYING CREWS,
MAYBE FULL-ON ATTACK.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.270
- AND WE'LL REPRISE.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.907
BUT THIS IS WHY
WE'LL PREVAIL.

30:07.940 --> 30:11.210
THE FORESHORTENED CEREBELLUM...

30:11.243 --> 30:15.214
AND THE DEEP
SUBCRANIAL RIDGE...

30:15.247 --> 30:17.984
RUNS ALL THE WAY AROUND.

30:18.017 --> 30:21.087
NO FORESIGHT OR INTELLECT.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.890
JUST THE FAINTEST HINTS
OF HUMANITY.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.625
- BARELY HUMAN, YOU MEAN.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.929
- SHOW ME THE SAVAGE PLATO,

30:29.962 --> 30:33.900
AND I WILL READ HIM.

30:33.933 --> 30:37.503
- TELL YOU WHAT.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.239
YOU FIGHT YOUR WAR.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.408
I'LL BUILD MY RAILROAD.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.443
CRAZY SON OF A BITCH.

30:44.476 --> 30:48.414
- BOHANNON, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU LOST THE WAR?

30:57.589 --> 31:00.392
THE TYPICAL SOUTHERNER
LACKS THE ABILITY

31:00.426 --> 31:04.130
TO LOOK BEYOND
HIS OWN PAROCHIAL INTERESTS.

31:04.163 --> 31:07.133
IT'S A MALFORMED
BRAIN PLATE, PERHAPS.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.169
- OH, YEAH?
[pistol barrel clicks]

31:15.307 --> 31:16.976
- DON'T LOOK SO MORTIFIED.

31:17.009 --> 31:21.147
THESE ARE EXCITING TIMES.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.983
YOU AND I
ARE OPENING THE WAY

31:24.016 --> 31:28.054
FOR THE GREATEST NATION
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.289
[thunder]

31:35.962 --> 31:38.931
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST BUILDING A RAILROAD.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.933
[heavy rain falling]

31:40.967 --> 31:43.970
GOOD DAY, MR. BOHANNON.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.194
- MR. BOHANNON!
- WHAT?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.229
- INDIANS ATTACKED
A SURVEY PARTY

32:10.262 --> 32:13.265
5 MILES NORTH
OF THE CUT.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.238
- ANYBODY ELSE KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

32:19.271 --> 32:21.040
- NO, SIR.
DROVE STRAIGHT HERE.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.408
- WANT ME TO SOUND THE ALARM?
- HELL, NO.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.577
THAT'S THE LAST THING
WE NEED.

32:25.611 --> 32:29.215
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO?

32:29.248 --> 32:33.052
- ME AND MR. FERGUSON ARE GOING
TO BURY THESE MEN QUIET,

32:33.085 --> 32:34.286
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELEGRAPH
THE FORT,

32:34.320 --> 32:38.057
ASKING FOR MORE SOLDIERS.

32:38.090 --> 32:42.194
- MORE SOLDIERS?

32:42.228 --> 32:45.097
- TO HELP BENDIX FINISH
WHAT I STARTED.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.133
HUP!

33:05.051 --> 33:09.021
[thunder]

33:10.256 --> 33:12.258
[crows cawing]

33:21.567 --> 33:25.237
- MOSTLY OLD FOLKS' HEADS
IN THAT BAG.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.306
- EVA SAY THE WORST THING
YOU CAN DO

33:27.339 --> 33:30.476
TO AN INDIAN
IS CUT HIS HEAD OFF.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.647
[grunts]
SPEND ETERNITY LOOKING FOR IT,

33:35.681 --> 33:40.152
NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE GREAT WHITE WAY.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.322
- LONG TIME TO LIVE, NOT TO GET
TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.656
- [grunts]

33:44.690 --> 33:46.625
SOME CHURCH FOLK SAY

33:46.658 --> 33:49.228
INDIANS GO TO HELL
WHEN THEY DIE

33:49.261 --> 33:51.497
'CAUSE THEY AIN'T ACCEPTED
CHRIST.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.799
- FAR AS I KNOW,

33:53.832 --> 33:57.035
INDIANS DON'T BELIEVE
IN HELL.

33:59.705 --> 34:03.709
- THEN IT DON'T MATTER, THEN.
LET'S GO GET A DRINK.

34:03.742 --> 34:08.480
[bell clanging,
thunder]

34:15.687 --> 34:17.856
- TELL YA, IT WAS
THE MOST BRUTAL ENGAGEMENT

34:17.889 --> 34:20.826
SINCE SHILOH,
AND I WAS THERE!

34:20.859 --> 34:24.163
- GIVE IT A REST, WALLACE,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

34:33.372 --> 34:37.376
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.278
THAT'S DECLAN TOOLE.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.313
- [sniffs]

34:46.252 --> 34:49.255
GREGORY TOOLE
WAS MY BROTHER.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.892
I CAME OUT HERE TO TAKE
HIS CHILD AND THE MOTHER

34:53.925 --> 34:55.494
BACK TO NEW YORK.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.330
- SHE MY WOMAN.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.532
AND THAT'S MY BABY.

35:00.566 --> 35:04.136
- I CAN'T JUDGE
MY BROTHER'S CHOICE OF WIFE,

35:04.170 --> 35:08.307
BE IT WHORE OR SAINT.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.875
BUT THAT BABY
IS MY BROTHER'S.

35:09.908 --> 35:13.279
- SHE MINE.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.481
- BY LAW,
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.583
- BY BLOOD,

35:17.616 --> 35:21.253
SHE MINE.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.155
- I UNDERSTAND
THERE'S SOME DOUBT TO THAT.

35:23.189 --> 35:26.192
- NAH, AIN'T NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.730
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.199
- MY BROTHER'S IRISH BLOOD

35:33.232 --> 35:35.634
RUNS THROUGH
THAT BABY'S VEINS.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.303
- YOUR BLOOD GONNA BE
ON THIS FLOOR

35:37.336 --> 35:39.338
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.772
- ALL RIGHT.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.809
Y'ALL BOTH DONE SAID
YOUR PIECE.

35:43.842 --> 35:47.213
STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.383
- YOU MUST BE MR. BOHANNON.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.752
- I AM.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.688
- MY BROTHER CONSIDERED YOU
THE ONLY UPRIGHT MAN

35:56.722 --> 36:00.492
HE'D EVER MET IN AMERICA.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.499
- WELL...

36:08.867 --> 36:13.739
- REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.855
[birds chirping]

36:32.824 --> 36:34.726
- ELDER DUTSON,

36:34.760 --> 36:36.662
WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR
OF ALLOWING ME

36:36.695 --> 36:38.664
TO SAY THE GRACE?

36:38.697 --> 36:40.632
- OF COURSE, MR. ANDERSON.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.835
- OKAY.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.606
THANK YOU, LORD,
FOR THIS BOUNTY

36:47.639 --> 36:51.643
YOU HAVE PLACED BEFORE US.

36:51.677 --> 36:55.013
AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
THIS BLESSED FAMILY

36:55.046 --> 36:57.283
INTO MY LIFE

36:57.316 --> 37:00.352
AND FOR ALL THEY HAVE DONE
TO REMOVING ME

37:00.386 --> 37:03.422
FROM MY--MY SORROW

37:03.455 --> 37:06.858
AND MY GRIEF.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.527
AMEN.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.728
- AMEN.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.763
[horse whinnies]

37:15.801 --> 37:17.636
- AMEN.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.440
[knock at door]

37:21.473 --> 37:22.974
- YOU MIND SHARING A PICNIC
WITH ME?

37:23.008 --> 37:25.811
- NO. PLEASE COME IN.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.281
I WAS ABOUT TO HAVE LUNCH.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.616
- LOOKS LIKE YOU WAS
ABOUT TO HAVE YOURSELF

37:30.649 --> 37:32.351
A NICE BOWL OF DISHWATER.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.885
- I MADE IT MYSELF.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.922
- YEAH, AND I'M SURE
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.427
I KNOW IT PROBABLY
DOESN'T COMPETE

37:41.460 --> 37:45.931
WITH RIB STEAK AND BEANS AND...

37:45.964 --> 37:49.701
A HOT SHEAF
OF CORNBREAD.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.738
BUT I RECKON YOU CAN
CHOKE IT DOWN, DON'T YOU?

37:55.341 --> 37:58.644
WE ARE BUTCHERING A NEW HERD
OF CATTLE TODAY.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.348
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE A TASTE
FOR SOME MEAT.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.616
- [sighs]

38:06.552 --> 38:10.822
- MM.
- MMM.

38:10.856 --> 38:15.494
- LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED
'CAUSE OF THIS.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.530
LOT MORE TO FOLLOW.

38:20.599 --> 38:24.370
- KILLING IS A SIN,
MR. BOHANNON.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.339
- THERE GOES ANY APPETITE
I HAD.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.840
- WELL, BESIDES THE INDIANS,
WEREN'T THERE OTHERS

38:28.874 --> 38:33.412
WHO DIED AT YOUR HAND?

38:33.445 --> 38:35.414
- THEMS WAS RUSTLERS
AND SUCH.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.615
- AND YOU KILLED THEM.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.651
- YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT
I DID.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.923
DAMN IT.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.458
RUTH, IT'S MY JOB.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.093
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.928
BUT KILLING THEM
SHOULD MAKE YOU LOSE

38:49.961 --> 38:53.465
YOUR APPETITE AS WELL.

38:53.499 --> 38:56.368
- I DON'T TAKE JOY
FROM IT.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.636
- A MAN WHO HATES
HIS SIN

38:57.669 --> 39:00.572
CAN BE REDEEMED FROM IT,

39:00.606 --> 39:03.942
EVEN IF HE CAN'T TURN
AWAY FROM IT.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.715
DO YOU HATE YOUR SIN,
MR. BOHANNON?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.139
- CORNBREAD'S DRY.

39:36.141 --> 39:39.144
- THEN THERE IS HOPE FOR YOU.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.383
- EAT.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.029
- THE RAILROAD HEADQUARTERS
WILL BE HERE.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.198
MY OFFICE WILL BE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR,

40:00.231 --> 40:02.768
OVERSEEING
THE LARGEST RAIL YARDS

40:02.801 --> 40:05.704
ON THE PLANET.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.939
EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING
THAT TRAVELS BY RAIL,

40:07.973 --> 40:11.209
EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
WILL PASS THROUGH HERE.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.811
- AND STAY AT MY HOTEL...
- MM-HMM.

40:12.844 --> 40:16.815
- WHICH WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.817
- DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE CLOSE TO THE BANK?

40:18.850 --> 40:22.120
- I CHOOSE THE LOCATION
OF MY HOTEL AND ITS DESIGN.

40:22.153 --> 40:25.657
IT'S GOING TO HAVE
A CASCADING STAIRCASE.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.859
- PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER
OVER THERE,

40:27.893 --> 40:29.094
BY THE MERCHANT SQUARE.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.696
- NO.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.798
IT WILL BE EXACTLY
WHERE I'M INDICATING,

40:32.831 --> 40:35.701
ACCORDING TO THE TERMS
OF MY SALE TO YOU.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.670
YOU SHOULD READ
THOSE DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.739
- OF COURSE.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.641
- I'VE ONLY READ
ABOUT CASCADING STAIRCASES,

40:42.674 --> 40:45.644
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE LADIES
LIKE TO COME DOWN THEM

40:45.677 --> 40:48.480
IN THEIR BALL GOWNS.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.115
IS THAT TRUE, THOMAS?

40:50.148 --> 40:53.852
- WELL, IT DOES LEND A LADY
A CERTAIN ETHEREAL CHARM

40:53.885 --> 40:56.822
TO DESCEND SUCH A STAIRCASE
ON THE ARM

40:56.855 --> 40:58.089
OF A HANDSOME MAN.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.791
AT LEAST, THAT HAS BEEN
MY EXPERIENCE.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.662
- HMM, WELL, THEN YOU WILL HAVE
TO BUILD A BALLROOM.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.063
AND I WILL HAVE TO LEARN
TO DANCE

41:05.096 --> 41:07.899
SOMETHING
OTHER THAN THE HORNY TOAD STOMP.

41:07.933 --> 41:11.102
- [laughs]
YES, INDEED, MAGGIE.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.540
ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT
THE HORNY TOAD STOMP

41:14.573 --> 41:16.608
IS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHARMS.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.210
- [chuckles]

41:19.244 --> 41:25.250
[bird chirping]
