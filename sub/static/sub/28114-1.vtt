I will now put my hand
inside your waistband.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.944
-Okay.
-And I will run my hand inside

11:36.946 --> 11:40.014
and around your entire waistband
and search your pants.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.899
Excuse me. Here.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.769
Okay.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.837
Okay. Return to the scanner.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.039
(machine whirrs)

11:48.041 --> 11:50.708
Do you have anything
in your pockets?

11:50.777 --> 11:51.909
No.

11:51.978 --> 11:56.981
Okay, look, I'm wearing
these special underwear.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.134
They're, like, super thick
and absorbent,

12:00.269 --> 12:03.671
and kind-of-ish like a diaper.

12:03.740 --> 12:04.872
But they're underwear.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.040
Because...

12:07.877 --> 12:10.745

-Pull up your pants.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.913
Take your stuff.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.048
Thank you.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.000
Pull your pants up.

12:33.036 --> 12:34.669
Okay, I am.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.940
(woman makes indistinct
announcement over P.A.)

12:40.910 --> 12:43.010
-Hi. What can I get you?
-Hello.

12:43.046 --> 12:46.079

a vodka cranberry, please--

12:46.116 --> 12:49.233

French fries with gravy.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.235

-Mm-hmm.

12:53.907 --> 12:58.909
Okay... (chuckles)

12:58.945 --> 13:00.845

13:10.073 --> 13:11.806

13:14.077 --> 13:15.943
It's state policy.

13:20.149 --> 13:22.099

when to meet up in L.A.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.734
She had to miss this flight
to return the car.

14:13.870 --> 14:15.970
-Aw. That's too bad.
-Mm.

14:18.007 --> 14:20.808
So, you from Chicago,
or are you going home?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.676
No, I'm going home.

14:22.712 --> 14:24.945

off at college.

14:24.981 --> 14:27.682
-Oh, wow.

you're a terrorist.

-And how was Chicago?

23:14.777 --> 23:16.643
I've been watching
Max's stories.

23:16.712 --> 23:19.513
Good. Thank you for asking.

23:19.515 --> 23:23.466
There's about 40 people
downstairs. What are you doing?

23:23.502 --> 23:24.735
You have to go to sleep.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.538
I can't.
I have too much work to do.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.674
I have to finish reading the
first act of a play by tomorrow.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.609
Well, how much of it
have you read?

23:32.611 --> 23:33.811
I didn't even start it yet.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.812
I haven't read it.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.613
Wait, what?

23:36.615 --> 23:38.532
It's a play, Mom. I can't do it.

23:38.534 --> 23:39.833
-I can't concentrate.
-(sighs)

23:39.835 --> 23:44.571
My God, that's because
your people are fighting

23:44.706 --> 23:46.907
a mass generational
heroin addiction,

23:46.909 --> 23:48.775
death of focus,

23:48.778 --> 23:53.781
self-soothing
because of these things.

23:53.916 --> 23:56.467
Can you read it to me?

23:56.602 --> 23:59.936
Seriously, Frankie?

23:59.972 --> 24:01.538
(sighs)

24:01.574 --> 24:03.807
Dude, I'm exhausted.

24:03.843 --> 24:07.611
If I told you what my day
was like, okay?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.880
In the first place, my plane...

24:09.899 --> 24:11.682
I don't even know
how to tell you...

24:11.800 --> 24:13.433
Forget it, Mom.

24:13.469 --> 24:15.436
Just forget it.

24:18.774 --> 24:21.441
(exhales)

24:21.477 --> 24:24.511
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'll, um...

24:24.547 --> 24:28.866
I'll j... I'll...
read one scene out loud,

24:28.868 --> 24:32.469
and then you read
one scene out loud,

24:32.538 --> 24:36.406
and we go back and forth until
we finish the first act, okay?

24:36.542 --> 24:39.576
We just get it
down our necks. Mm?
