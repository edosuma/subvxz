00:12.400 --> 00:14.560
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.800
Tony, someone just dropped off
a dead body infected with a virus.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.160
Based on the autopsy,
by the end of the first week...

00:20.240 --> 00:22.320
nine percent of Los Angeles County
will be infected.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.280
That's over a million people.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.800
We want the release of Ramon Salazar.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.440
If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.080
Jack, you know Salazar better than anybody
else here. Who do you think we're dealing with?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.160
Without a doubt, his brother.
Hector was next in command.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.520
He went underground the second Ramon
was taken into custody.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.040
- Have you made the call to the F.B.I?
- Yes, I did.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.160
- What about our boy?
- I'm watching him now.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.400
What are you into here, man?
Are you selling dope?

00:48.480 --> 00:51.280
This guy, he paid me five grand
to bring some coke over the border.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.920
I did that last night.
Today, I drop it off, I get another five.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.320
- When did the F.B.I. get this call?
- About 20 minutes ago.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.200
And we don't know
who we're dealing with.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.520
- It was a scrambled voice on an open line.
- Do we cancel the debate?

01:03.600 --> 01:07.360
They are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.360
Chase, no day is a good day.
We said that we would tell him...

01:11.480 --> 01:14.720
if we were still together
after two months... it's almost three.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.080
Why don't we just tell him
and get it over with?

01:18.200 --> 01:20.840
Listen, Jack, you were
under with Salazar for six months.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.560
I know what they did to you.
You look like hell.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.880
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.960
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.360
The following takes place
between 2:00 p.m. And 3:00 p.m.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.560
The president's not gonna make any decisions
until he knows what we're dealing with...

03:05.720 --> 03:09.200
so give me all
the parameters, Tony.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.640
Well, basically what we have here is
a terrorist demand.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.800
Someone close to Ramon Salazar...

03:13.880 --> 03:15.960
we're guessing his brother, Hector...
is demanding his release.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.840
If we don't comply,
he's threatening to initiate an outbreak...

03:18.920 --> 03:21.080
of a very deadly, fast-acting virus.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.400
How do we know if these people
are really in possession of it?

03:23.480 --> 03:26.480
Well, Wayne, I've got
Dr. Sunny Macer on the line.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.880
She's Technical Director of National
Health Services. I'll let her address that.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.160
Mr. Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body
was anonymously delivered to our office.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.240
It was infected with
a type three pneumonic virus...

03:36.320 --> 03:38.200
deliberately introduced into its system.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.160
This virus kills within
24 hours of exposure...

03:41.240 --> 03:43.640
and there's no known
antidote or vaccine.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.000
What's particularly disturbing
is how fast it spreads. Take a look.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.080
As you can see,
it's latent for several hours...

03:51.160 --> 03:54.200
but once the symptoms present,
it consumes the host rapidly.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.720
Our office will be sending you
preliminary projections of casualties...

03:57.840 --> 03:59.880
in case something like this
should be unleashed.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.440
"And Wayne, I gotta tell" ya...
it's pretty bleak.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.960
I don't understand. I thought we knew
what biological threats were out there.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.480
Now, how do we find ourselves up against
the wall so suddenly with something...

04:11.560 --> 04:14.680
- "that isn't even on our radar?"
- " This is a strain we've never seen."

04:14.800 --> 04:17.880
The autopsy is confirming that
someone has engineered this virus...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.560
to kill 10 times faster
than its ordinary genotypes.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.040
Okay. Okay, I see.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.240
Sir, I can't underscore enough
how potentially devastating it would be...

04:27.320 --> 04:29.720
if this virus were released by terrorists.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.400
Given this information, what options will
the president be looking at?

04:33.480 --> 04:38.200
It's the unwavering policy of the United States
to stand firm against any terrorist advance.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.240
Now, I know the president, Tony.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.280
He will not free Salazar,
no matter what the threat.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.600
All right. Then we can't waste any time
on standard protocol today.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.720
We've been given five hours to comply.
If we're going to find these people...

04:50.840 --> 04:54.120
and stop this threat, C.T.U. Has to have
every possible resource at its disposal.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.920
- You'll have it.
- All right.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.320
If we have nothing else to discuss,
I'd like to get my team back to work.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.160
- Understood.
- Thank you.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.200
This is Bauer.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.520
- Dad, it's me.
- What, Kim?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.920
Adam and I just found something on Goss.
We're working it up now.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.040
- We should have an address for you pretty soon.
- Okay, good work.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.720
- And, uh, Dad, remember I wanted to talk to you.
- Why, is something wrong?

05:16.800 --> 05:21.160
No, I was just wondering if I could come up
for a few minutes. It's personal.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.360
Sweetheart, right now's not a good time. As
soon as I've got a moment, I'll come down, okay?

05:25.440 --> 05:27.280
Yeah, thanks.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.360
- They're getting close to Goss.
- You didn't shoot up, did you?

05:32.440 --> 05:35.280
What? You think
you can hide it from me?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.480
I'm not trying to hide it from you.
I'm trying to quit.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.200
Okay, people don't
just quit, Jack.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.760
I've been tapering off.
Okay, now it's time to stop.

05:43.880 --> 05:48.120
Doesn't look like it's time. Today is not
a good day for you to be needing a fix.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.480
Why don't you go work with Chloe and see if
you can pin down a location on Hector Salazar.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.400
What's wrong with the methadone program?
It takes a little time, but it works.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.960
I am not going on record with this addiction.
Do you understand me?

06:03.040 --> 06:06.520
Right now you're the only person who knows
about it. It's going to stay that way.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.560
Okay, this is nothing to be ashamed of.
You did this in the line of duty.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.600
Doing junk was the only way you could get
close to Salazar. Nobody's gonna knock you.

06:12.720 --> 06:18.000
I know what I did, Chase. This conversation's
over. Just get back to work.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.680
Yeah.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.080
- Chase?
- What?

06:31.160 --> 06:33.840
I was just looking at a playback of the
Health Services briefing.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.200
- What about it?
- The government's not gonna
let this happen, are they?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.320
I mean, Salazar's just one person,
no matter how bad he is.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.880
Forget all that, Chloe.
We need to operate under our orders...

06:40.960 --> 06:44.920
- and that is to find the carrier of this virus.
- Find the carrier? In four hours?

06:45.040 --> 06:48.320
- Come on, Chase. That's not likely, is it?
- Not if we sit and debate it.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.440
Weren't you supposed to find
a modified list of Goss associates?

06:51.560 --> 06:54.160
Kim's bringing it up now.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.200
Great. Then go over the autopsy report.
See if there's anything they overlooked.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.720
Fine.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.040
Here are the files on Goss.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.640
I heard you talking to your dad
when I was in his office.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.280
- Why do you want to tell him today?
- 'Cause it's not a big deal.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.920
Well, it is a big deal. Not only do I work
for him, but I'm also a field agent.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.760
- It's the last thing he wants for his daughter.
- How do you know that?

07:31.840 --> 07:35.000
I know, okay?
I mean, he talks about things.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.920
About how he was never there
for you or your mom.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.320
He doesn't believe a field agent can have
a relationship outside of work.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.440
Well, did you ever stop to think that
maybe it would make him happy?

07:49.520 --> 07:52.280
That his daughter's found
someone she loves?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.680
Look, I love you too.
I just don't think today's a good day.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.840
Chase, I need you to
copy me on that list.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.200
- Okay, what's this column keyed off at?
- That's family. That's legal.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.240
- Great.
- Okay.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.520
I understand. I just want you to cross-reference
those files with our Latin American files.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.880
Yes, I want all the names printed out.
Okay, get that intel over to my office. Thanks.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.360
Hey, Dad.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.960
- Hey, sweetheart.
- You all right?

08:35.039 --> 08:38.760
- Yeah. Why, what's going on?
- Chase said you were really stressed out.

08:38.840 --> 08:43.080
- Stressed? What-What do you mean stressed?
- You know...

08:43.159 --> 08:45.040
Salazar and the terrorist threat.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.400
Yeah. Yeah, but I think we're gonna
get it under control.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.320
We just got a lot of work to do.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.800
- Listen, can I talk to you now?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.160
Take a seat.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.920
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, after all we've been through...

09:11.000 --> 09:14.160
I find it very difficult
to keep things from you.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.680
Okay, what's up?

09:19.880 --> 09:22.840
Chase and I have been
going out for a while...

09:22.920 --> 09:25.960
and it's starting to get serious.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.840
- Whoa.
- I mean, I think he wanted to
be the one to tell you.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960
But, uh, he was worried that it would
cause a problem between you two.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.480
I see.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.240
How long have the two of you
been seeing each other?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.160
Three months.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.680
I really care for him, Dad.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.680
- So, what do you think?
- I don't know what I think.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.840
I'm really surprised.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.720
And, I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted with
everything that's going on today.

10:19.840 --> 10:24.680
I know, but... forget it.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.240
- I just had to let you know.
- I'm glad you told me. I am.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.520
- Okay.
- I love you.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.680
Love you too.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.960
I told him.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.840
What'd he say?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.840
Nothing.

10:58.600 --> 11:02.000
Dessler.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.480
It's Sunny. I think I found something
that might be helpful to you guys.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.440
- "What's that?"
- "Pathology found something odd"
in Goss's system.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.520
We found an unmetabolized
virus particle.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.360
I'll skip the technobabble.
Bottom line...

11:12.480 --> 11:14.920
it looks like the virus was delivered in
a crystalline form.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.200
Maybe what you're
looking for is a white powder.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.320
So, it would look like
a bag of cocaine or heroin?

11:21.400 --> 11:24.680
Yeah, that may even be the strategy. Someone
thinks they're selling a bag of coke...

11:24.760 --> 11:26.280
when in fact, they're handling the virus.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.160
Look, Kyle, I'm not gonna do it, okay?

11:30.280 --> 11:32.960
I don't care how much you pay me.
It's dealing drugs.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.840
Come on. You're my best friend. Come on.
You gotta come through for me here.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.960
Look, you should've talked to me before you
went down to Mexico and bought a bag of coke.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.760
I'm not... I'm not asking you to do
anything but wait in the car, all right?

11:42.840 --> 11:46.120
- I'll make the delivery.
- I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna go with you.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.320
Fine.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.640
- Kyle, it's Zach.
- Zach, hey, what's up?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.800
- We need to talk.
- Hold on a second, man.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.760
- "Who's Zach?"
- It's nobody.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, what's with you guys today?
Everything's a secret.

12:04.120 --> 12:08.360
He's got family stuff going on.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.160
- What's going on, man?
- You tell me. You got the powder?

12:11.240 --> 12:13.880
Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.
What time you want me to drop it off?

12:13.960 --> 12:16.880
- Tonight. Come by around 7:30.
- 7:30, yeah.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.760
Can we just go over it one more time?
Like how this whole thing's gonna go down?

12:20.880 --> 12:24.160
Go over what? You drop off the coke.
I give you the money.

12:24.320 --> 12:28.080
- Is that too much for you to handle?
- No. No, that's totally cool.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.280
It better be.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.040
Sir? Yeah. Uh-huh.
Yeah, that's it.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.400
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Michelle.

12:54.520 --> 12:58.280
We got a last-known address
on David Goss, the infected body
dropped off at Health Services?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.880
- How recent?
- Two months.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.160
Okay, have L.A.P.D.
Send over a perimeter team.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.560
- Tell 'em hands off until Chase and I get there.
- Got it.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.200
Chase, let's go. We're on.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.760
- Get an address?
- Yeah.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.800
Make sure they understand. They are not
to go in until Jack gets there, okay?

13:21.920 --> 13:25.680
- Hey. Peter just told me you got
an address on Goss.
- Yeah.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.680
- I'm bringing it over toJack now.
- There's nothing more recent?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.600
We could spend another hour looking, but
there's no guarantee we'll find anything better.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.360
Yeah, well, we don't have
an hour to waste, do we?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.280
Look, uh, put transmitters on Jack
and Chase. I wanna be analyzing...

13:37.400 --> 13:41.160
- all their interactions so we can work it up
in real time, all right?
- Okay.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.520
- Jack.
- What do you got?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.800
This is everything we have on Goss. Here's
the address where he was arrested for dealing.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.560
- How recent?
- Two months ago. It's all in the file.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.800
- You can check it on the way.
- Good.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.400
- Medical kit. Health Services
had us put it together for you.
- Thanks, baby.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.520
Mm-hmm. Be careful.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.080
Let's go, Chase.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.480
We're gonna have to wait till we get there
to see what the setup is.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.560
L.A.P.D. Is locking it down now.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.160
Look, I know Kim told you about us.
I was gonna tell you myself.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.520
I just couldn't find the right time.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.400
I thought you should know.
It's getting serious.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.840
That's what she said.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.760
What did C.T.U. have to say?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.840
That it could be
a very dangerous situation.

14:51.920 --> 14:55.880
Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could
happen if this virus is released, and it's not good.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.840
Give C.T.U. Carte blanche.
Whatever they need, make sure they get it.

15:00.960 --> 15:01.990
I did.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.120
- We should cancel the debate.
- What?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
It's a mistake to continue
prepping for tonight...

15:06.080 --> 15:09.320
while there's an imminent
bioterrorist threat against this country.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.200
First of all, "we" don't know that
it's imminent, David.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.520
And you know just as well as I do that
we get threats every day.

15:16.640 --> 15:20.760
Not like this one. They said the body
was infected with a weaponized virus.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.160
Okay, let's say you're right.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.880
What do you really think you could do
if you put your full attention on it?

15:29.560 --> 15:34.240
I wanna make sure you're not advising me out
of fear that my image will suffer if we cancel.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.400
Oh, no, it will suffer.

15:36.480 --> 15:40.480
But I still think the best thing to do
is to proceed as planned...

15:40.600 --> 15:43.440
and respond when
we have more information.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.320
Keeler's here.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.200
- Come on. Let's go this way.
- Don't worry, Wayne.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.040
- John.
- Mr. President.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.680
You didn't have to come all the way
down here just to welcome me.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.880
- It's no trouble.
- I" "spoke with your old friend"
Jacob Weiss yesterday...

16:05.960 --> 16:08.560
- "at a fund-raiser."
- He stopped in South Dakota?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.920
- Just for dinner.
- How's he feeling?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.040
Better. Much better. He's even playing
a few rounds of golf.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.360
That's him.
Well, I don't wanna keep you, John.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.080
I know you have a lot of last-minute cramming
to do if you want to survive this debate.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.520
I won't argue with you there,
Mr. President.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.080
Your research staff, compliments of the
taxpayers, outnumbers mine three-to-one.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.120
- I actually have to do
some of the shoe leather myself.
- Touche.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.520
- " I'll see you inside, sir."
- You certainly will.

16:34.680 --> 16:38.000
Make sure that no one,
and I mean no one, hears about this.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.600
- Wayne? We're ready.
- I'll give you a call, all right?

16:49.200 --> 16:52.520
- What were you talking to him about?
- I think we may have an opportunity.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.240
- What kind of opportunity?
- Not now. After.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.440
I'm sorry if you think I'm not
good enough for your daughter.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.599
Okay, but I can't help the way I feel.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.839
Chase, why do you think
I put Kim at C.T.U...

17:18.960 --> 17:20.640
behind a desk working at a computer?

17:20.760 --> 17:23.319
So I could keep an eye
on her. Make sure she's safe.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.599
- Not so she could start dating some field agent.
- "Safe?"

17:27.680 --> 17:30.520
You know, you're talking about her like
she's 12 years old. She's a grown woman.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.760
Damn it, Chase,
you've seen what this job can do to you.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.320
You've seen what it's done to me.
It's ruined every relationship I've ever had.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.640
- "That's you, Jack."
- No! No! It's the job.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.640
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so. What the hell do you know?

17:44.760 --> 17:49.000
My wife died because of this job,
and I almost lost Kim too.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.120
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

17:52.200 --> 17:56.440
I will do everything I have to to protect her,
do you understand me? Everything.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.640
Damn it, Chase...

17:58.720 --> 18:02.120
you cannot have a normal life
and do this job at the same time.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.560
So you're saying I shouldn't have
a relationship with anyone?

18:06.680 --> 18:10.160
That's exactly what I'm saying.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.040
And especially with my daughter.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.720
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Luis.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.640
- What's up?
- You tell me.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.200
I tried to move Salazar back to solitary,
but there was a lock on it from Division.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.920
- What's that all about?
- I can't tell you right now.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.880
Jack, the bastard murdered his attorney
right in front of us.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.520
What the hell is Division doing
protecting him?

18:34.640 --> 18:37.240
- They're not protecting him.
- Then what?

18:37.360 --> 18:40.200
- I can't get into it right now.
- Can't go into it?

18:40.280 --> 18:43.000
You're not the only one who gave up
a chunk of his life to put this guy away.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.360
I need to be in the loop, Jack.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.560
- Jack?
- This information doesn't go
anywhere after you hang up.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.160
- What?
- Salazar might walk.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.080
Walk? What are you talking about?

18:55.160 --> 18:57.000
Look, I don't think
it's gonna get to that.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.440
But someone on the outside's
got a lot of leverage.

18:59.560 --> 19:04.280
- Who?
- I think it's his brother, Hector.

19:04.440 --> 19:08.200
- I don't believe this.
- Just hang tight.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.760
Yeah, all right.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.120
You better start thinking about what
we're gonna do when we get there.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.920
- "We'll talk about this later."
- Fine.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.480
Open the door. Let's go.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.320
- Open 12.
- " Opening door."

19:47.960 --> 19:50.160
- "Step forward."
- Let's go.

19:52.120 --> 19:57.600
- I got his hands.
- Luis...

19:57.680 --> 20:01.480
No, I haven't found you a new lawyer.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.480
- How about an execution date?
- Mm, someone's not happy.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.080
- What do you know, Ramon?
- About?

20:20.440 --> 20:23.680
- Talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

20:23.760 --> 20:26.800
What is your slimeball brother trying to do?

20:26.920 --> 20:29.680
Hector? Have you heard from him?
How is he?

20:29.760 --> 20:33.360
His birthday's coming up next week.
I don't even know what to get him.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.800
You keep talking trash, man.
You're not going anywhere.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.040
Maybe not.
But let me assure you of one thing.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.360
If something does happen,
and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free...

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
I have no doubt that
you'll come looking for me.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.040
Especially after the death
of your wife, Elyce.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.000
And your two boys...
What are their names? "Tomas" and Luis Jr?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.560
There's been no follow-up phone call
from the terrorists?

21:19.640 --> 21:23.760
- No.
- So, basically, there's nothing
new to report to the president?

21:23.880 --> 21:27.160
Not till I hear from Bauer. He's following up
on the Goss lead right now.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.600
All right, Tony, thanks.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.200
So, if you'll excuse me,
until this evening's debate. Thank you.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.520
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much for all of your questions.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.480
- That went well.
- Yes, it did.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.280
- So, what's the latest?
- Nothing yet.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.600
C.T.U.'s working their leads, trying to
figure out who dropped off the dead body.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.000
So we still don't know
who's behind this threat?

21:49.080 --> 21:52.080
No, they're still speculating that
it's Salazar's brother, Hector.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.320
What they don't know is if it's
a bluff staged to release Salazar.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.200
Well, how can it be a bluff if the virus
has been confirmed?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.680
Yes, but dropping off
a dead body is one thing, David.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.120
Being able to infect an entire city...
that's something different.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.840
All right.
I guess we'll know soon enough.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.320
- Okay.
- Hey, Wayne.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.160
You spoke earlier
about an opportunity.

22:16.240 --> 22:21.800
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not really sure
that's something we need to discuss right now.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.480
Which means
whatever it is fell through...

22:25.560 --> 22:28.400
or you know I'm not going to like it so
you're proceeding without me.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.960
No, that's not it. I just think that
because of this threat...

22:32.080 --> 22:33.840
I don't want to divert your attention.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.920
I can walk and chew gum
at the same time. What is it?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.720
Keeler's playbook.

22:45.800 --> 22:50.080
- What if I can get us a copy?
- What exactly do you mean by playbook?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.000
His entire prep for tonight's debate.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.920
How he's going to answer the questions...

22:54.000 --> 22:57.960
what issues he's going to try
and trip you up on... everything.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.880
Mm-hmm. And how would we get it?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.240
You don't need
to know the details.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.800
- I'm surprised.
- By what?

23:13.880 --> 23:18.440
The question. You know there's no way
on earth that I would ever agree to this.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.880
David, I'm not...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.520
I am not talking about
pulling a Sherry and stealing it.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.720
Now it may just drop in our laps,
and if it does, why shouldn't we look at it?

23:27.840 --> 23:32.800
Wayne, you are not
in the private sector anymore.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.880
You have to get used to
how my administration works.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.760
And I'm just trying to give
your administration four more years.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.600
Okay.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.960
Okay, if that's how you want it.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.760
That's how I want it.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.480
All right, we're just about to start.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.960
Take your seats here.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.200
Hey, Kim, you all caught up?

24:08.280 --> 24:12.160
Pretty much. I just have to refresh
the data on my dad's panel.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.120
Great.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.400
Can I ask you a question
about you and Tony?

24:17.480 --> 24:21.480
- Me and Tony what?
- I don't know. I was just wondering...

24:21.600 --> 24:25.760
is it a problem working with
your husband in the same office?

24:25.840 --> 24:29.960
No. No, it's not a problem.
Why do you ask?

24:30.040 --> 24:33.960
- It's not a big deal.
- No, it's okay. We have a minute.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.280
Well, I've, um, been dating Chase...

24:37.360 --> 24:39.880
and I don't think my dad's
too happy about it.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.360
I see.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.960
Well, um... Look, I'm sure your dad's
just trying to protect you...

24:46.040 --> 24:49.800
but, ultimately, it's just between
you and Chase.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.200
Yeah, I know.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.040
- Let me know when you finish those panels.
- Sure.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.400
Analysis just called.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.960
They determined that if Hector Salazar
is orchestrating this bio-threat...

25:09.040 --> 25:11.080
he's probably operating
out of northern Mexico.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.040
- We're gonna need a list
of his properties down there.
- Chloe's working on that.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.240
She's going through the brief files
Jack turned in after the bust.

25:16.360 --> 25:20.600
All right. I'll talk to her.
Fire up all our contacts down there...

25:20.720 --> 25:23.560
just in case Hector was stupid enough to
show his face in the last couple of days.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.800
Okay.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.440
- Is the boy still in place?
- Yeah.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.200
- The president's been informed?
- Yeah, and he's not canceling the debate.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.120
He's got some cojones.
I'll give him that.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.680
Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when
he has a couple of million lives on the line.

25:48.880 --> 25:53.440
" Papa, no tengo miedo.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.800
Claudia.

26:04.440 --> 26:08.680
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.160
Don't tell me nothing.
Why you argue with your father?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.800
Please, Hector, it doesn't matter.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.800
He's not happy with how I live my life.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.360
You mean he doesn't
like you being with me.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.360
"Si, senor?"

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
Don't raise your voice
to your father ever again.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.720
Claudia, no!

26:50.800 --> 26:56.320
How I conduct myself with my father is
my concern, not yours.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.360
Good. Now that's settled.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.480
Tell Lucia to prepare supper, okay?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.160
We eat early tonight.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.360
Okay, I'll tell him.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.520
Almeida.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.480
Tony, it's Chloe. I just got off the phone
with Jack. They just arrived.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.320
- All right. Is there a problem?
- Jack's not going to use the transmitters.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.800
- Why not?
- He says it would take too long to wire them up.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.640
Whatever.
Look, you're running point from his side.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.560
Any information he digs up,
I want it right away. You got it?

27:55.680 --> 27:59.760
- Uh, okay, you don't have to yell.
- No one's yelling, Chloe.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.480
Look, we got a body infected
with a deadly virus.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.600
Somehow we have to tie it to Salazar
in the next three hours.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.160
Right now Jack's location
is our only lead.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.760
- So I need you to keep me
up to the minute. Understood?
- I already said okay.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.720
Good, then get on it.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.760
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah, you Bauer?

28:23.840 --> 28:26.160
Yeah. This is my partner Chase Edmunds.
What's the activity?

28:26.240 --> 28:29.760
- No one's gone in or out since we got here.
- How does the inside lay out?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.720
Probably 30 people total,
spread out on all floors.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.280
The apartment you asked us to case
is the corner one there, on the third floor.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.680
- You didn't go in there, right?
- Our orders were to stand down till you got here.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.000
- Good.
- How much backup you want?

28:41.120 --> 28:45.160
- None. Right now I want
your men to cover the exits.
- There's 30 scumbags in there.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.800
Yeah. We don't want to set off any alarms.
The two of us can sneak in without a fight.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.560
- You sure about that?
- Yep.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.120
Keep this open on channel one. We'll let you
know when we want you to come in. Ready?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.280
- Let's go.
- "You got it."

29:19.680 --> 29:24.120
" I told you that, bitch!"

29:48.400 --> 29:51.120
This area's not open to the public.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.680
Just take it easy, sport. We're not here
to take anybody down.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.840
We just want a little information.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.320
- Zach! Cops!
- " Go, Chase!"

30:14.680 --> 30:16.120
Get back!

30:17.520 --> 30:19.160
Cover me.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.760
Reloading!

30:31.840 --> 30:34.480
Chase, we got a runner!

31:21.760 --> 31:25.120
- "Don't even think about it!"
- I'm clean. You got nothing on me!

31:25.240 --> 31:28.360
Shut up, stupid.
You just fired at a federal agent.

31:28.440 --> 31:32.720
You better start talking to me, or I will let
you bleed to death right here on this landing.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.640
Chase, I got him.
We're down here.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.760
- Hey, Fisher, we're good. We got our suspect.
- Who is David Goss?

31:38.840 --> 31:41.240
Goss is a dealer.
I score from him sometimes.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.160
- Well, not anymore. He's dead.
- Okay, he's dead.

31:44.280 --> 31:48.400
Don't be a smart-ass.
Who was his supplier?

31:49.720 --> 31:52.200
Who was his supplier!

31:52.280 --> 31:54.680
Chase.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.600
A guy named Carlos Corretja.
He works out of Tijuana.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.000
Corretja's one of Salazar's
midlevel distributors.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.760
- "You doing business with him?"
- I'm supposed to call him tonight.

32:08.880 --> 32:13.240
Corretja wanted me to find a mule.
Someone clean without a record.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.160
- "What for?"
- He wanted to move a small bag
of coke across the border.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.800
- It didn't make any sense to me.
- Why not?

32:18.880 --> 32:22.320
He paid 10 grand to bring it up.
Coke isn't even worth that much.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.520
- Where's the bag of coke now?
- The guy who brought it across still has it.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.120
- What's his name?
- His name is Kyle. Kyle Singer.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.720
Sorry, Helen, but you really
aren't giving me any room.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.160
- Wh-What is this?
- It's a final notice.

32:39.280 --> 32:43.560
You don't pay the rent by
tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m...

32:43.640 --> 32:46.440
I'm calling City Services,
and they start the eviction process.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.360
Oh, Don, don't do this.
Please.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.720
- "I'm gonna have it in a couple of days."
- I can't keep carrying you.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.360
I'll be back.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.400
- Kyle...
- How much you owe him, Ma?

33:13.520 --> 33:16.640
- Stay out of this.
- How much?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.960
Eighteen hundred dollars.
But, don't you worry about it...

33:19.080 --> 33:21.680
because your father's
gonna talk to Uncle Sanford.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.080
Hey, 1,800, right?

33:38.160 --> 33:40.080
Here.

33:43.200 --> 33:47.160
From now on, if you have a problem,
talk to me or my dad. Okay?

33:48.720 --> 33:51.840
Leave my mom out of it.
I expect a receipt in the mailbox.

34:04.160 --> 34:09.040
- Where did you get that money?
- It doesn't matter, okay? We needed it. I got it.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.960
Could I have everybody's
attention, please?

34:15.040 --> 34:17.880
Everyone should be
working up the name Kyle Singer.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.239
All right? I want point sheets from department
heads on my desk in the next five minutes.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.120
Everything there is to know about Kyle Singer,
I want it. Where he lives. Where he works.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.520
And most importantly,
where he's likely to be right now.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.480
Also, keep an open channel
to Field Ops so that Chloe...

34:29.560 --> 34:31.719
can forward anything that
comes in back to Jack.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.320
All right? Let's go.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.520
- What are you doing?
- Narrowing the search space.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.760
I can't believe
you're this stupid, Kyle.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.199
So this is how you're gonna
help your family?

34:54.320 --> 34:56.560
- By dealing drugs?
- I'm not dealing 'em.

34:56.639 --> 35:00.720
It's a stupid delivery, all right? And it's quick
money which my folks need right now.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.400
Where are they gonna get
the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle?

35:11.640 --> 35:14.000
Okay, you're right.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.440
I'm stupid, all right?
I know that.

35:16.560 --> 35:20.720
But, I did it.
I mean, I'm in this now.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.520
I'm in the middle of this.

35:23.600 --> 35:27.400
I'm gonna make this
delivery tonight, all right?

35:27.480 --> 35:29.840
I promise it's gonna be
over. I promise you.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.920
I'm not waiting until tonight.
It's over now.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.560
"What are you talking about?"

35:38.640 --> 35:40.720
I can't be with someone
who does stuff like this.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.840
I'm sorry, Kyle.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.000
Hold on. Linda.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.080
- Come on, Linda. Please!
- It's over, Kyle.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.240
Are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

35:58.280 --> 36:00.200
We just had a little
disagreement, that's all.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.840
- Where did you get the money to pay Don?
- Mom, forget about it, please?

36:03.920 --> 36:05.760
What's your dad gonna say
when he finds out?

36:05.840 --> 36:08.880
He's not gonna take
"forget about it" as an answer.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.280
I don't know.

36:21.600 --> 36:25.840
- "Would you excuse us, please?"
- David.
- Yes, sir.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.040
Sorry, Anne, our schedule's
been way off today.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.480
- "No, I thought you weren't able"
to join me for lunch.
- I'm not.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.000
I only have a couple of minutes.

36:33.080 --> 36:37.200
I'm having your security level upgraded.
I'm gonna need your advice today.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.640
- What's going on?
- What do you know about
type three pneumonic viruses?

36:43.400 --> 36:46.840
Not a lot. They're fairly new.
As far as I know there are several strains.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.240
Most of them are fast-acting
and all are deadly.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.640
Someone's threatening to
release a virus here in L.A.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.920
Oh, God.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.760
I need you to talk to a Dr. Sunny Macer
at National Health Services.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.920
Yeah, I know Sunny, but, David...

37:00.040 --> 37:03.240
if you think there's a remote possibility
that this thing is for real...

37:03.360 --> 37:05.720
you need to get out of Los Angeles.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.160
That's not possible.
The debate is in a little over two hours...

37:09.280 --> 37:12.480
No, don't tell me about the debate. You're
talking about an outbreak here in the city.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.680
This isn't something the Secret Service
can protect you against.

37:16.800 --> 37:21.800
I know, I know. And we are prepared
to leave if the situation warrants it.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.640
But right now,
I need you to talk to Dr. Sunny Macer...

37:24.720 --> 37:27.720
and learn everything
you can about this thing.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.400
- I will.
- It's okay. It's all right.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.000
Yes.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.720
- Your brother would like to speak with you, sir.
- Well, send him in.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.840
He's downstairs.
He requests that you come see him.

37:48.920 --> 37:52.360
- Come see him?
- Yes, sir. He has something
to show you down there.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.760
You go ahead.
I'm going to call Sunny.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.600
I'll see you later.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.040
No, I'm gonna check that out myself.

38:04.160 --> 38:08.200
Chase is bringing the suspect in to C.T.U.
I want you to set up a white room for him now.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.880
- I need you to take Parker down to C.T.U.
- What about Kyle Singer?

38:10.960 --> 38:13.720
I'm gonna take care of Singer.
I want you to take care of Parker.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.720
Anybody can take him back and set him up.
I'm going with you to get Singer.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.880
- No, you're not.
- Why are you trying to get rid of me?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.040
I'm not.
I still think Parker's got more information.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.360
- I want you to get it out of him.
- Is this about Kim?

38:24.440 --> 38:27.440
Are you punishing me
for dating your daughter?

38:27.560 --> 38:30.280
You listen to me. If that kid's
walking around with a bag of cocaine...

38:30.400 --> 38:32.040
that's got the virus
in it, and he doesn't know it?

38:32.120 --> 38:34.240
I need to find him and stop him from
putting it into circulation.

38:34.320 --> 38:37.800
- Yeah, I know. That's why I want to help you.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.800
- Too dangerous?
- You can't have it both ways, Chase.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.640
My daughter loves you. You wanna be with
her? Then I have to stop putting you in harm's way.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.040
You're kidding, right?

38:48.120 --> 38:51.400
Take Parker to C.T.U.
That's an order.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.680
- Yeah. Call you right back.
- All right. Same number.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.720
Excuse us for a minute.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.960
What is it, Wayne?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.600
Don't be angry, David, but I got a copy
of Keeler's playbook.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.200
- Damn it, I told you to drop that.
- "You just listen to me."

39:28.280 --> 39:32.600
If you don't wanna use it, then don't.
But there is something you need to see.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.240
There's nothing I need to see.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.240
It's about Anne.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.640
Keeler's too smart to play the race card
or the girlfriend card.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.480
It's neither one of those, which is why
I'm bringing this to you.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.000
It's something that
we didn't know about her.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.600
Something that if true could...

39:55.160 --> 39:57.120
David, it could damage all of us.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.520
Just take a look at it.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.480
- Yeah?
- Give me an update.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.520
- Kyle's still in his house.
- What about the package?

40:43.640 --> 40:46.480
- It's with him.
- And Ramon?

40:46.560 --> 40:49.400
- Just waiting to come home.
- Good.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.960
Gael, there you are.
Chloe's been looking for you.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.280
- Where is she?
- She's in I.T.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.200
All right.
