00:01.502 --> 00:03.671
Tim Allen delivers the laughs
in Last Man Standing.

00:03.704 --> 00:04.905
It's science.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.540
Catch all-new episodes
Fridays.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.042
And check out
our other programs--

00:08.076 --> 00:09.543
The Masked Singer
and The Cool Kids.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.744
Only on Fox.

00:14.882 --> 00:18.086
I love pinball.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.188
Ah. You never played?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.022
Oh, no, sir.
Our pastor always said,

00:22.056 --> 00:24.092
"Only churches should have
that many bells."

00:24.125 --> 00:25.826
-(laughs)
-What the hell?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.529
Hey, hey, Mikey, look at,
look at this. Come here.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.698
I bought this
for the game room at my house,

00:30.731 --> 00:32.666
and they delivered it
here by mistake.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.069
-Great story. Get rid of it.
-No, no, no.

00:35.103 --> 00:38.038
I'll get rid of it in a few
days, but, but try it, it's fun.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.940
Yeah, so much fun.
I only want to be paid

00:39.973 --> 00:41.742
-in quarters from now on.
-(chuckles)

00:41.775 --> 00:43.244
Not interested.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.279
Okay, so you weren't
into pinball.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.448
It's not for everybody.
Only for those

00:47.481 --> 00:49.283
who aren't afraid
to live a little, yeah?

00:51.919 --> 00:55.689
All right. Move aside, I'm just
gonna show you this one time.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.591
All right. Go ahead.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.360
(Mike sighs)

00:59.393 --> 01:01.629
Oh, he knows
where the money goes.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.431
I think we got a ringer.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.065
(machine beeps and jangles)

01:05.099 --> 01:06.900
(game buzzes)

01:06.934 --> 01:08.902
Oh, you have to use
the flippers, Mr. B.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.244
-(game buzzes)
-Let me have your tie.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.378
Okay.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.813
What's that about-- tie?

01:19.847 --> 01:21.115
(game whirring)

01:21.149 --> 01:23.083
Uh, this isn't golf.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.719
Low score does not win.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.821
All right?
(clears throat) So...

01:29.623 --> 01:30.958
(inhales deeply)

01:30.991 --> 01:33.127
(exhales)

01:44.672 --> 01:47.575
No cussword way.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.743
I believe...

01:49.777 --> 01:52.913
that would be a free game.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.084
Now get the cussword
back to work.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.085
(laughs)

01:58.118 --> 02:00.120
*

02:04.992 --> 02:07.695
Thanks for coming
grocery shopping with me, Jen.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.929
I know it's a chore.

02:08.962 --> 02:09.997
Not at all.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.965
At first, I was put off
by all the ridiculously

02:11.999 --> 02:13.967
oversized product at the store,

02:14.001 --> 02:17.238
but then I found this.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.574
God bless America.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.011
Ooh, good,
you guys went shopping.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.879
Kyle and I are gonna need this
at the new apartment.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.215
No. You can't take all of them.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.650
I'll leave you one. (chuckles)

02:31.219 --> 02:33.687
Hey. Uh, if you're here
to steal toilet paper,

02:33.721 --> 02:35.122
I already got it.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.791
Uh... no. Kris is stealing
ink cartridges,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.660
and I'm just
the sexy getaway driver.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.996
Uh, hey, guys. Look at this.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.334
Looks like someone wrote a poem
and left it in the printer.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.701
"To my little bird,

02:47.735 --> 02:49.337
"About to fly the nest
into the night,

02:49.370 --> 02:53.241
Our time is precious,
like a piece of tanzanite."

02:53.274 --> 02:54.642
Interesting.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
Hmm. It's certainly lyrical.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.978
The rhyme scheme's
a little forced,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.748
but I guess I'm just
a free verse kind of guy.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.583
Wha... What's tanzanite?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.184
Uh, a gemstone.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.986
It was in the earrings
Mom gave me for Christmas.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.187
Oh, my gosh.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.156
Mom wrote me a poem

03:09.189 --> 03:11.225
because I'm moving out
next week.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.927
Hmm. When you moved out,
all you got

03:13.961 --> 03:16.697
-was a box of pancake mix
and a can of bug spray.
-Shh.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.099
Hey, hey. Uh, parents care for
their kids in different ways.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.534
Some get meaningful words,

03:20.568 --> 03:25.339
others get flapjacks
and a can of poison.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.441
Big deal. Okay?
I don't care. (chuckles)

03:27.475 --> 03:29.677
I mean, I only gave Mom
her first grandchild.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.246
That should merit a poem, right?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.448
"My darling Kristin,
how the light..."

03:34.482 --> 03:36.517
No. Not from you. N...

03:36.550 --> 03:39.219
You-you know what? I'm just
gonna up my daughter game

03:39.253 --> 03:40.888
and earn myself a poem.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.390
Okay. Good luck.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.857
It'll be hard to compete
with this little bird.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.893
-Tweet, tweet.
-Hmm.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.029
"My darling Kristin,

03:49.062 --> 03:50.564
"One-upped by her sister,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.733
Abandoned in the foyer of life."

03:57.237 --> 04:00.207
We've been trying for an hour
to duplicate that pinball trick,

04:00.240 --> 04:03.311
and I'm starting to think
it's not a trick.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.045
It's not.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.747
Listen.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.551
There was a time that pinball,
literally, was my life.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.320
-You were that good, huh?
-I wasn't good.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.087
I was... I was the best.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.956
Huh. Well...

04:15.989 --> 04:18.492
Kids from other schools
would drive to Ann Arbor

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
just to take me down.

04:20.428 --> 04:24.064
Takes a lot to make a man drive
to Ann Arbor.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
I didn't go to class,
I didn't go out.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.535
It was an obsession, man,
you know,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.970
and every time I turned, there
was some twitchy-fingered kid

04:30.003 --> 04:31.739
just looking to find me and go,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.907
-"Hey, I hear you're
the one to beat."
-Wow.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.976
You were like Clint Eastwood,
right?

04:36.009 --> 04:39.246
In every Clint Eastwood movie.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.914
There got to be a point
where I was hoping

04:40.948 --> 04:42.316
-that I'd get beat, you know?
-Yeah.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.251
Somebody to take the target
off my back.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
But God was right there
saying to me,

04:46.320 --> 04:49.156
"I only made one of you,
Baxter."

04:49.189 --> 04:51.992
That's a hell of a story, Mike.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.961
Yes. Don't worry, I'll get rid
of the machine tomorrow.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.262
-Don't worry.
-(knocking on door)

04:55.295 --> 04:56.497
-Yeah.
-Oh, hey.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.831
Uh, Kyle was looking for you.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.333
Oh. Thanks, Chuck.
Don't worry about that.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.234
-Thanks, man.
-Yep.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.244
I hear you're the guy to beat.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.850
(vocalizing)

05:16.884 --> 05:18.018
What are you doing here?
You're cooking?

05:18.051 --> 05:20.153
Oh. Oh, yeah. Just throwing

05:20.187 --> 05:23.691
a little somethin' somethin'
together for Mom.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.793
-Oh, chicken Bellagio?
-Mm.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.061
You're just, uh, throwing
together Mom's favorite meal?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.730
Oh, yeah, that's right.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.799
Now that you mention it,
I do seem to recall

05:31.832 --> 05:35.068
that she loves it.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.637
Is it love, Kris?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.206
I mean, it's not like
she's written it a poem.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.410
Hey.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.379
-Mom, hi.
-Hi. Uh, wait, no.
You know what?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.314
Let's keep your coat on.
I'm gonna take you to dinner.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.483
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.
I made-I made dinner.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.051
-Yeah, just sit down and...
-You? Oh. Oh, okay.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.320
-and I'll get you
a glass of wine.
-Okay.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.589
Sit down!

05:55.623 --> 05:58.859
Wow, wow, look at all
this attention I'm getting.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.662
-I-I feel so special.
-Yeah.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.130
You are so special.
Get away from her.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.337
(chuckles) Hey. Hold on.
You guys found my poem.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.272
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, yes.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.443
And I would love to hear it
performed by the author.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.878
Oh, really? You don't think
that would be kind of weird?

06:17.911 --> 06:20.714
-No.
-Yes.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.083
Yeah. You-you go ahead
and read it, Mom.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.252
(crying):
I'll try to keep it together.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.287
(sighs) Okay.
(clears throat)

06:27.320 --> 06:29.557
Oh, gosh.
I'm actually kind of nervous.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.792
Uh, Jen!

06:31.825 --> 06:34.361
(chuckles):
Um, uh, Jen?

06:34.394 --> 06:37.397
Uh, that's not
how the poem starts.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.469
(mouth full):
Yes, Vanessa?

06:41.502 --> 06:44.972
I'd like to read a poem
I wrote for you.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.607
Wait, what?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.443
Yeah. I hope when you're back
in Hong Kong,

06:49.477 --> 06:52.312
you will read this
and-and think of me.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.215
Oh, I'm going to cry.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.085
Want some flapjacks now, Mandy?

07:07.995 --> 07:10.263
"So, farewell, little bird.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.600
"I hope you know
you will be missed.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.768
"You'll forever shine,

07:14.802 --> 07:17.638
like purple amethyst."

07:17.671 --> 07:21.108
That is the sweetest poem
I've ever heard.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.610
I want to frame it.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.944
Oh. (chuckles)

07:23.977 --> 07:25.813
Well, we can use one of Mike's.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.215
He won't notice one less picture
of him and John Elway.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.286
-(chuckles)
-What are you grinning at?

07:33.320 --> 07:36.256
You. I know that there are
26 letters in the alphabet,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.892
but all I see are "N," "V."

07:40.528 --> 07:42.663
Okay, I fell a lot farther
than you.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.465
Um. I had everything,
then I had nothing.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.134
You had nothing,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.036
then a little
s-sideways shuffle,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.871
and then still nothing.

07:50.904 --> 07:55.175
Okay, starting to share
your resentment.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.010
We need to win Mom back.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.278
(whining):
How?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.948
What if we treat her

08:00.981 --> 08:03.517
to a spa weekend
at the Abbott-Berry?

08:03.551 --> 08:06.019
Okay. I am all
for winning Mom back,

08:06.053 --> 08:08.155
but can't we find some place
a little bit cheaper

08:08.188 --> 08:09.957
than the Abbott-Berry?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.458
I mean, I don't want to have
to tell Boyd

08:11.491 --> 08:13.160
that he's going
to community college.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.829
This is no time to pinch
pennies. We are at war.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.065
Our mother's love has been
stolen by a foreign power.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.366
It's collusion.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.837
I... Oh, I, uh,
I just need a pen.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.874
Jen wants me to autograph
the poem before we frame it.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.876
-Aw.
-That is so sweet.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.344
-Yeah.
-Um, unrelated,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.814
uh, so Kris and I were just
talking, and we realized

08:33.847 --> 08:36.483
that we haven't been spending
enough time with you lately.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.151
-Oh. Yeah, it bothers me, too.
-KRISTIN: Yeah.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.020
-Yeah. So why don't
you pack your bags?
-Yeah.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.755
Because we are stealing you away

08:41.789 --> 08:43.490
for a weekend
at the Abbott-Berry.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.493
(gasps) What? Really?
The Abbott-Berry? (chuckles)

08:46.526 --> 08:48.228
Unless that's too glitzy.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.030
You know, there are a lot
of other great spas.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.765
-Are you kidding? No.
-I mean, you know what I mean?

08:51.799 --> 08:54.501
-I love this. I love this.
-Okay, then. Yeah, sure.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.104
Oh, I have the best daughters
in the world.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.540
(kissing noises)
Oh. The Abbott-Berry!

09:03.911 --> 09:05.713
I'm gonna head down
and have some lunch.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.581
What are you gonna have--
chicken?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.082
Oh, that's right.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.419
You don't eat your own kind.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.189
I'm not playing you in pinball.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.125
Why is this so important to you?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.893
I'll tell you why.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.662
Because I was great, man.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.533
'Cause I was great.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.403
It was 1986,
the annual pinball tournament

09:30.437 --> 09:32.873
at Flippo's Arcade
in Minneapolis.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.708
(chuckles)

09:34.742 --> 09:37.978
This was the year I was
gonna take home the crown.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.982
Was there actually a crown?

09:42.015 --> 09:45.485
It was a baseball cap
with boobs on it.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.421
It was a different time.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.223
I was in the final

09:50.257 --> 09:53.160
against Petey "Pinball" Johnson.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.797
Wha... Are you familiar with
the Captain and Tennille game?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.766
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.434
-Uh, electro-mechanical,
double flippers.
-Yes.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.103
You got a free game
if you could, uh,

10:03.136 --> 10:05.806
spell "Muskrat Love."

10:06.840 --> 10:08.575
I was on it.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.010
All rollovers and spinners,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.745
-not a single outlane.
-Yeah.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.647
And then, out of nowhere...

10:14.982 --> 10:16.616
...the fire alarm.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.688
Someone had pulled it.

10:20.721 --> 10:24.291
"Pinball" Johnson.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.926
We had to evacuate.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.460
I had to forfeit.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.663
He stole my...

10:32.866 --> 10:35.669
He stole my boob hat.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.875
(exhales)
This is sad on so many levels.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.212
I need this, Baxter.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.615
Yeah... I'll play you one game.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.150
-Yes.
-But it won't matter,

10:50.183 --> 10:52.019
-you're still gonna lose.
-(scoffs)

10:52.052 --> 10:55.355
Hey, you've never played against
Chucky "The Greek" Larabee.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.427
Who was in charge of nicknames
up there in Minneapolis?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.330
MANDY:
Great.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.033
Thank you. We will see you
in a couple hours.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.035
Ah. We are all set.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.470
-You, me and Mom
in the deluxe suite.
-(sighs)

11:10.503 --> 11:12.672
We are gonna sea-salt-scrub
that Jen

11:12.706 --> 11:15.709
right out of our mother's heart.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.577
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.379
Oh, are you going somewhere?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.849
Uh, yeah. We are taking
our mom to the Abbott-Berry

11:21.882 --> 11:23.851
for an expensive spa weekend.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.920
It's fine. Boyd can just
go to community college.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.823
Uh, it'll just be us Baxters,
though,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.926
but-but you'll have Dad
and your poem.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.896
Mm.
Hope you understand.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.765
Of course.
There's nothing more important

11:37.798 --> 11:40.367
than the time a girl gets
to spend with her mom.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.370
Oh, we know.
Don't think we don't.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
It's important
to build memories,

11:45.438 --> 11:47.507
because some day
that's all you'll have.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.509
I know, because...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.745
well, you know, my mom is dead.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.881
-No...
-(groaning)

11:54.948 --> 11:57.050
Enjoy this time, you guys.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.958
Oh, all set.
(giggles)

12:04.992 --> 12:07.360
I am so excited. Yeah.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.097
I have the most loving,
generous,

12:10.130 --> 12:12.099
best daughters in the world.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.134
(sighs)

12:15.668 --> 12:17.670
Just... just get in the car.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.607
Oh.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.484
We should just come clean to Mom
and turn around.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.454
Uh, sure. Yeah. We'll just say
we broke the orphan's heart.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.723
We have to do something.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.959
Okay? The guilt is killing me.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.794
Let's just put it out of
our minds. We can get through

12:40.828 --> 12:42.796
the weekend, and we'll make it
up to Jen when we get back.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.899
Hmm. Don't take this the wrong
way, but it is a lot easier

12:45.933 --> 12:48.468
-for you
to put things out of your mind.
-(fake laughs)

12:49.702 --> 12:51.839
So, it's okay.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.640
-Ooh.
-I got road trip snacks.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.843
-Ah.
-I am pretty sure

12:55.876 --> 12:57.811
there's not
a naturally-occurring substance

12:57.845 --> 12:59.746
-in any of this.
-Mmm. Mmm.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.515
Just what I need-- something
else to eat away at me.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.618
Uh-uh, no, no, no,
this is a guilt-free trip.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.420
You hear that, Kris? Guilt-free.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.856
-Mm.
-Now let's go.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.291
Oh, you know what?
Um, before we go,

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
guys, I-I just want
to clear the air.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.096
-Hmm.
-I know why
you girls are doing this.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.498
-You do?
-I do, yeah. I do.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.533
It's because lately

13:20.567 --> 13:23.670
I haven't made the effort
to be present in your lives.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.438
-(chuckles) Actually, Mom...
-No.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.607
Don't interrupt her. Maybe
that's why she abandoned us.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.376
(laughs)
No, I don't...

13:29.409 --> 13:32.445
I don't think I abandoned you,
but... but I have been busy,

13:32.479 --> 13:34.181
and I haven't been
connecting with you

13:34.214 --> 13:35.949
as much as I would like to.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.118
Well, you're forgiven, Mom.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.120
(sighs)
What a beautiful word.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.155
-"Forgiven."
-Hmm.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.623
Uh, it's not just you, Mom.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.625
I mean... we have lives, too.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.628
I-I'm a newlywed and an
up-and-coming fashion designer.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.197
-Mm-hmm.
-I have a new apartment.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.033
And Kris... has that kid.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.072
Well, you know, that's why
Kristin understands this.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.741
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Look, the worst thing

14:01.774 --> 14:05.778
a mother can do is to disappear
from her child's life.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.051
ED:
All right,

14:11.084 --> 14:13.486
listen up, everybody. One game.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.823
Three balls each.
High score wins.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.726
All betting is forbidden,
all right?

14:19.759 --> 14:22.162
But your bets will be paid
after the match.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.831
All right, Mike, you're up.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.933
Ready to do this, Greek?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.200
-Let's dance.
-All right.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.601
Oh, geez.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.270
Are you all right, Kyle?

14:30.303 --> 14:31.838
No, I-I'm a nervous wreck.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.506
I mean, you, the man
who's like a father to me,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.342
playing Chuck,
who's an employee of the man

14:35.375 --> 14:36.876
who's like a father to me.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.180
Just relax. It'll be over
before you know it.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.348
(game chirps)

14:41.381 --> 14:44.217
*

14:44.251 --> 14:46.920
(dinging, warbling)

14:58.498 --> 14:59.799
*

15:06.506 --> 15:07.674
(dinging and clacking)

15:26.126 --> 15:27.927
(dinging and clacking)

15:46.279 --> 15:47.514
(dinging and clacking)

15:47.547 --> 15:49.616
Hey, uh, hey, Greek,
you notice the score?

15:49.649 --> 15:50.917
You're still behind.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.285
(dinging and clacking)

15:52.319 --> 15:54.287
Stay out of my kitchen, Baxter.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.856
This is how we do it in the 612.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.925
Nice try.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.795
There's nothing you can say to
make Minneapolis sound badass.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.164
(fire alarm ringing)

16:04.197 --> 16:05.999
What the hell is that?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.434
It's the fire alarm.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.802
Oh, hell no.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.472
-(dinging)
-Fiddlesticks, everybody.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.541
What a shame,
but-but safety first.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.276
Everybody out,
everybody out, come on.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.378
Just finish up, finish up.
Keep going, keep...

16:18.411 --> 16:19.946
But I'm the head of security.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.283
-The store is on fire.
-Unless it's a false alarm.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.352
(dinging continues)

16:25.385 --> 16:28.321
I've got a lot of lettuce
riding on you, Mike.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.024
Huh? I thought
you were a cinch to win.

16:31.058 --> 16:34.161
Thanks, Baxter. I couldn't
have done it without you.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.596
-Done what?
-Win.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.067
(dinging)

16:41.934 --> 16:44.871
Yes! (chuckles)

16:44.904 --> 16:46.973
-Sorry, Ed.
-That's all right.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
I'm out 45 bucks.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.814
-Congratulations.
-Ah.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.250
Don't have a boob hat for you,
but you know what you do get?

16:57.284 --> 17:00.853
-What?
-A bunch
of twitchy-fingered kids

17:00.887 --> 17:02.989
just wondering
how good you really are.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.024
-Aw, man.
-There you go, guys.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.727
The guy to beat.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.397
Ah. (chuckles)

17:10.430 --> 17:12.399
Okay.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.401
Yeah. (laughs)

17:14.434 --> 17:16.703
Uh, Baxter?
Damn it.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.407
Et tu, sister?

17:25.112 --> 17:26.513
Jen-Jen!

17:26.546 --> 17:28.548
Our little bird!

17:31.784 --> 17:34.154
(mouth full):
I don't know what's happening,
but I love it.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.091
Ah. The girls excluded you

17:38.125 --> 17:40.026
from our weekend
because they were jealous

17:40.059 --> 17:42.028
of all the attention I give you.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.731
Isn't that awful?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.799
You don't look
like you think it's awful.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.868
Oh! No, it's terrible.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.870
(giggles)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.439
Oh, they were just being petty.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.207
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.309
I'm sorry. It's just,
my daughters haven't competed

17:56.343 --> 17:59.146
for my affection since 2004.
(laughs)

17:59.179 --> 18:01.181
A mother remembers.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.752
Well, I'm-I'm sorry
that we were so selfish, Jen.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.321
We're honored
to share our mother with you.

18:08.355 --> 18:12.125
Thanks, because Vanessa is the
second-best mom in the world.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.726
(sighs):
Yeah.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.061
Well, I mean, you've...

18:15.094 --> 18:16.929
you never told us much
about your mom.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.266
Well, I lost her
when I was a little girl,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.668
-and I don't like to make people
feel uncomfortable.
-Mm.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.903
Oh. It doesn't make us
feel uncomfortable.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.439
I mean, it totally did at first,
but-but not now.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.609
We would love to hear about her

18:29.642 --> 18:31.110
if you would like to share.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.682
Well, my mom was
a very elegant woman.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.017
-Very fashionable.
-Mm.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.820
For her birthday one year, I
bought her this beautiful scarf.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.589
Oh, that's so sweet.

18:42.622 --> 18:47.527
Not really. It turns out
she was allergic to wool.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.128
She broke out in huge hives.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.597
One above her lip,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.499
(laughing):
another above her eye.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.800
(laughs):
No.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.968
She looked like that, uh, uh...

18:56.002 --> 18:59.206
Who's that sailor who's angry
who eats all the spinach?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.840
-VANESSA: Oh, um...
-Popeye?

19:00.873 --> 19:02.209
-Mm.
-Yes! (laughs)

19:02.242 --> 19:03.643
(Vanessa laughs)

19:03.676 --> 19:06.279
But she refused
to take off the scarf

19:06.313 --> 19:08.481
because it was
from her little girl.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.949
(chuckles)

19:09.982 --> 19:13.386
I still remember her saying,
"No, I love it."

19:13.420 --> 19:15.655
(laughter)

19:15.688 --> 19:17.857
VANESSA:
Yeah.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.326
Those were her last words.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.261
(gasps)
Oh, no.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.397
I'm kidding.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.865
Oh! (laughs)

19:27.534 --> 19:30.069
Well, your mom
sounds amazing, Jen.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.240
She was. Thank you
for asking about her.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.475
We-we would love
to hear more about her.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.644
And you can tell us
at the Abbott-Berry.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.412
Go pack, because
you're coming with us.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.414
-(Kristin laughs)
-VANESSA: Mm.
-Are you sure?

19:41.448 --> 19:43.216
I heard that place
is very expensive.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.218
Oh, it's my treat.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.389
-(phone ringing)
-Ooh. Wonder who this is.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.225
-Oh, hey, it's Eve!
-Don't pick up! Do not pick up!

20:00.066 --> 20:02.269
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.604
My good buddy
Billy Shakespeare wrote,

20:04.637 --> 20:08.174
"Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

20:08.207 --> 20:11.010
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

20:11.043 --> 20:14.180
Yeah, London
in the swingin' 1590s.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
You could... you could still

20:16.249 --> 20:19.218
thrust your greatness
upon people. (chuckles)

20:20.820 --> 20:23.222
Yeah, it was a different time.

20:23.256 --> 20:27.059
But no matter how an all-time
great reaches the top,

20:27.093 --> 20:28.561
they all face the same question.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.898
When is the right time
to pass on the crown?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.901
John Elway and Peyton Manning
timed it pretty good.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.204
They both won championships
and rode off into the sunset.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.807
-(hoofbeats)
-Hyah! Hyah! Come on now!

20:40.840 --> 20:43.109
(chuckles)
No pressure, Flacco.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.444
(laughs)

20:44.477 --> 20:46.479
(imitates inhaling, exhaling)

20:48.247 --> 20:51.217
But they were the exceptions.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.387
Usually we get Willie Mays
flopping around in center field

20:54.421 --> 20:57.156
for the Mets
like a grouper on a dock.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.927
Or the great Muhammad Ali
losing to Trevor Berbick.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.396
Trevor Berbick?

21:03.430 --> 21:06.399
Sounds like a digestive problem.

21:06.433 --> 21:10.102
Hell, even my buddy Billy
Shakespeare hung on too long.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.673
You ever seen a great production
of Two Noble Kinsmen?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.243
No.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.246
You don't want
to limp out like a lamb.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.782
You want to still be roaring
like a lion,

21:22.815 --> 21:26.453
just not a Detroit Lion.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.255
And while it may be hard
to know when to walk away

21:29.288 --> 21:30.957
from the thing
that made you great,

21:30.990 --> 21:33.793
it's never the right time
to be finished as a person.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.162
Life is a gift.
Every day is a gift.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.864
That's why
they call it the "present."

21:37.897 --> 21:40.867
And what you owe in return
for it is to keep growing,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.435
keep learning,
and keep getting better.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.471
And call your mom!

21:46.305 --> 21:48.240
Baxter out.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.277
(chicken clucks)

21:51.310 --> 21:53.245

Media Access Group at WGBH

21:55.748 --> 21:57.817
Still need more laughs
after Last Man Standing?

21:57.850 --> 22:00.052
Then here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.289
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Paradise Hotel.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.158
Fox's sexiest
dating competition returns.

22:06.192 --> 22:09.028
Hook up or check out.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.063
This May on Fox.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.633
ANNOUNCER: It's outrageous.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.801
Oh, my God!

22:14.834 --> 22:16.135
It's outlandish!

22:16.168 --> 22:17.837
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

22:17.870 --> 22:19.338
-It's out of control.
-Aaah!

22:19.372 --> 22:21.974
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

22:22.008 --> 22:23.476
It's Fox Sunday!

22:23.510 --> 22:24.977
-Oh...
-My...

22:25.011 --> 22:27.580
-Freakin'...
-(farts)

22:27.614 --> 22:28.748
Oh, my God.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.050
Sundays, only on Fox!

22:31.083 --> 22:32.084
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
