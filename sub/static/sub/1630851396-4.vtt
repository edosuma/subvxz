WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.461
-Check, check.
-Good?

00:02.544 --> 00:04.880
-Microphone check, one, two.
-We're good. Okay.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.884
I saw a video of a Krav Maga woman.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.969
Attackers came at her, she was like…

00:11.053 --> 00:12.471
and they were like, "Krav Maga."

00:12.554 --> 00:14.598
I was like,
"I gotta fucking take that class."

00:14.681 --> 00:16.475
So I signed up for a Krav Maga class.

00:16.558 --> 00:21.355
And what I learned is that
I've got about seven minutes before I die.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.982
Which is actually a long time.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.985
It's like-- At minute seven, I was like…

00:27.653 --> 00:28.946
I guess they can just--

00:29.029 --> 00:30.239
Just do what you wanna do.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.783
You have Atticus.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.118
This dog isn't doing anything.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.248
Atticus and I
have been taking a Krav Maga class.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.334
Little paws.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.623
My goodness.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.293
Oh, my goodness!

01:26.587 --> 01:27.588
Welcome.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.882
Let's dive into the program.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.175
Tonight…

01:32.551 --> 01:35.262
we're gonna be talking
about something we all know,

01:35.345 --> 01:37.097
but we cannot seem to admit.

01:37.848 --> 01:41.894
America has lost the war on guns.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.020
It's over, people.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.606
What, you don't know that?

01:46.773 --> 01:47.983
We've lost.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.777
How do I know we've lost? Take a look.

01:50.861 --> 01:54.615
Knoxville police have an
officer-involved shooting on their hands.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.034
This is a look at the scene earlier today.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.578
Oh, this is live,
so they are still this--

01:59.661 --> 02:01.246
Gotcha. Okay.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.958
It's the--
I forgot about the other shooting.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.506
"I was talking about that shooting,
but it's the other shooting."

02:11.548 --> 02:13.217
That is the amount of carnage

02:13.300 --> 02:16.428
the newscasters are forced to narrate
on a daily basis.

02:16.512 --> 02:21.517
An amount where it's possible to forget
an entire other mass shooting.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.896
"We are live with the shooting, not--
Oh, right, the other fucking shooting."

02:27.064 --> 02:28.899
It's like when you can't find your glasses

02:28.982 --> 02:31.068
and they've been on your head
the whole time.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.654
You think to yourself like, "Fuck!"

02:35.155 --> 02:37.241
Look, this is an easy mistake to make

02:37.324 --> 02:39.409
when we average
about 12 mass shootings a week.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.913
And you know what might help that?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.540
We need to arm our teachers.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.750
Yes.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.126
The solution to school shootings

02:48.210 --> 02:50.921
is apparently strapping up
Mr. Langdon from chemistry.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.051
Well, that only takes care
of school shootings.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.220
What if a shooting happens in a church?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.555
People in church should have guns.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.101
Amen?

03:05.602 --> 03:09.106
Are there any other professionals
whose jobs have nothing to do with guns

03:09.189 --> 03:10.899
or crime that need guns?

03:10.983 --> 03:13.443
I'd say 100%
of our pilots ought to be armed.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.906
A hundred percent of our pilots.

03:17.990 --> 03:18.991
Let me tell you something.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.246
That fucking goose wouldn't have dared
taken down Captain Sully's plane…

03:26.540 --> 03:27.833
if it knew he was packing.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.419
"I'm tired
of these motherfucking unarmed pilots

03:30.502 --> 03:32.045
on these motherfucking planes."

03:35.549 --> 03:37.217
I haven't-- Is that quote still relevant?

03:37.301 --> 03:38.635
Can I still--

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
Is that even useful that quote?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.723
So, yes.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.641
We've lost the war on guns.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.476
Personally,
I knew it was over after Sandy Hook.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.146
We had a chance to pick guns
or kindergartners, and…

03:50.355 --> 03:51.648
we went with guns.

03:51.732 --> 03:57.112
There are 393 million guns in America,

03:57.196 --> 03:58.739
and I don't want to be judgy,

03:59.698 --> 04:01.533
but I think it's gotten absurd.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.535
Hunting season has arrived.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.121
Diamond hunting season that is.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.081
If you have your sights set on this,

04:08.165 --> 04:10.792
you can get this free
from Lee Ann's Fine Jewelry.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.385
Every kill begins with K

04:21.845 --> 04:23.013
So here--

04:27.726 --> 04:29.228
I've really missed that.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.481
So here's the deal.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.736
The problem with guns
is that there's too many of them.

04:37.819 --> 04:42.366
And while research clearly shows
mo guns mo deaths,

04:42.449 --> 04:45.369
let's defer to the victors in this war.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.621
Mr. NRA,

04:47.704 --> 04:52.209
do you have any thoughts
on how the rest of us could die less?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.754
Lean in. Listen to me now.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.674
Go on.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.677
And never forget these words…

05:01.760 --> 05:04.513
Spit it out.

05:04.596 --> 05:08.684
To stop a bad guy with a gun,

05:08.767 --> 05:12.521
it takes a good guy with a gun.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.648
Yes.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.066
Why didn't I think of that?

05:16.817 --> 05:17.985
Shoot-outs.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.488
One question very quickly:

05:21.572 --> 05:23.866
How can you tell who's a good guy?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.119
You know what?
Maybe, I guess, just ask them.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.163
I'm sure people
are generally honest about that.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.374
I was a good guy on the street.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.377
I'm sure when Bruce gets here,
he'll tell you I was always a good guy.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.469
O.J. gets a gun.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.098
That's probably fine.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.393
Not his weapon of choice allegedly.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.103
You know--

05:57.191 --> 06:00.235
Are you taking O.J.'s side?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.112
Did that really just happen?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.782
O.J. knife joke and they're like,

06:05.866 --> 06:06.867
"Hey, buddy."

06:09.578 --> 06:11.246
"He's paid his dues."

06:15.626 --> 06:18.253
You know what? Actually, they're right.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.589
Doesn't make sense.
You know what's probably better?

06:21.673 --> 06:22.966
Don't let somebody tell you themselves.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.052
They're probably gonna lie. References.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.929
'Cause everyone's gonna say
they're a good guy.

06:27.012 --> 06:32.559
Maybe you know if a guy is good
if a different good guy gives him a vouch.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.271
There's a guy I'd like to really thank
here that people don't thank enough,

06:36.355 --> 06:39.858
but there's a kindly,
wonderful, gentle man

06:39.942 --> 06:41.860
that we all deeply love.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.238
His name is Harvey Weinstein.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.286
Harvey Weinstein gets a gun.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.624
You know what? This isn't gonna work.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.544
We're not gonna be able
to define good guys,

06:58.627 --> 07:02.589
so let's just focus on maybe keeping
guns away from bad guys.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.552
Like terrorists. They shouldn't have guns.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.637
A loophole in federal gun laws

07:08.720 --> 07:12.266
allows suspected terrorists
to buy guns here in the US,

07:12.349 --> 07:13.600
and they have.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.227
What the fuck?

07:16.103 --> 07:20.232
If you're on the terrorist watch list,
you can have a gun?

07:20.899 --> 07:21.942
Okay.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.570
What about registered sex offenders?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.407
Turns out sex offenders
apparently also need guns.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.286
So, we obviously can't agree
on who the good guys are,

07:32.369 --> 07:35.122
and we can't seem to agree
on who the bad guys are.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.457
So what are we supposed to do here?

07:37.541 --> 07:40.794
It's not a sci-fi Tom Cruise movie where
we have some magical premonition

07:40.878 --> 07:43.255
of which bad guys are about
to commit a violent crime

07:43.338 --> 07:46.008
and can intervene in the crime
before it's too late.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.552
Or is it?

07:48.635 --> 07:52.890
It appears a domestic dispute
led to the massacre at a Texas church

07:52.973 --> 07:55.434
that left at least 26 people dead.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.645
The gunman, Devin Kelley,
had a history of domestic violence.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.814
The GOP shooting at the baseball diamond--

08:00.898 --> 08:02.816
He had a history of domestic violence.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.194
Reports of domestic abuse,
domestic violence.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.237
…domestic violence complaints against him…

08:07.321 --> 08:08.906
…and an allegation of domestic violence.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.282
…history of domestic violence…

08:10.365 --> 08:12.326
Six arrests for domestic violence.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.494
-…domestic violence…
-…domestic violence…

08:14.578 --> 08:18.332
Twenty years old, and already has
a domestic violence history.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.878
Domestic violence offenders.

08:22.961 --> 08:27.382
It turns out domestic violence
is a predictor for gun violence.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.636
In fact, there's a study that suggests,
"A felony domestic violence conviction

08:30.719 --> 08:35.640
is the single greatest predictor
of future violent crime among men."

08:35.724 --> 08:38.227
This is our sci-fi movie fix.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.313
'Cause if we simply kept guns away
from domestic violence offenders,

08:41.395 --> 08:46.151
we could potentially stop
60% of mass shootings.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.737
Thirty percent of child firearm deaths.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.781
More than 50% of women--

08:50.864 --> 08:53.075
Sixty-five percent. Seventy-five--

08:53.158 --> 08:55.285
Okay, I'm sorry. Fuckload.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.834
Every 14 hours an American woman
is shot dead by an intimate partner.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.045
And you might not care about any of that.

09:05.128 --> 09:09.258
And if you're the type of person
who doesn't care about any of that,

09:09.341 --> 09:12.094
I do think I know an area
that may speak to you more.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.098
Two police officers shot and killed
responding to a domestic violence call.

09:16.181 --> 09:20.727
A rookie police officer was gunned down
responding to a domestic violence call.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.981
…shot and killed early this morning
responding to a domestic violence call.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.025
…shot and killed while responding
to a domestic violence call.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.152
…responding to a domestic violence call.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.238
…shot and killed in the line of duty.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.032
They were reportedly responding
to a domestic violence call.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.661
It turns out removing guns
from domestic violence offenders

09:37.744 --> 09:39.580
also backs the blue.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.623
Between 2015 and 2016,

09:41.707 --> 09:46.378
domestic dispute calls
made up 41% of all fatal police calls.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.297
For police, domestic violence calls

09:48.380 --> 09:52.176
are the single most dangerous calls
that they respond to.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.596
So why are we letting
these wife-beating cop killers

09:55.679 --> 09:57.764
get away with literal mass murder?

09:58.473 --> 10:00.475
And why is the Lifetime channel
the only network

10:00.559 --> 10:02.728
covering this phenomenon 24 hours a day?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.985
Oh, Tiffani Amber Thiessen,
I hope you get out.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.243
You guys saw that one too, right?
It was-- you know.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.912
It's entertaining, but I saw it coming.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.957
We treat domestic violence
like it's a tampon commercial.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.250
"Ignore the blood.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.961
Pay attention to the dancing women
in the white shorts.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.755
They're smiling. It's springtime.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.590
Everything's fine!"

10:33.050 --> 10:34.593
By the way, the law already says

10:34.676 --> 10:36.720
domestic violence offenders
can't have guns.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.931
If we just enforced that law,

10:39.014 --> 10:41.266
we would prevent
other types of gun violence,

10:41.350 --> 10:44.269
the kind that actually makes the news.

10:44.353 --> 10:49.483
It's not a solution, but it's a real
harm reduction model for gun violence.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.984
Unless, of course…

10:52.110 --> 10:55.364
Mr. NRA, you have
a better solution on the table?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.783
Arm America's women.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.118
Go fuck yourself.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.878
Hey, guys. It's your old pal
Uncle Glock here,

11:09.962 --> 11:12.297
and I want to talk to you about safety,

11:12.381 --> 11:15.843
and the scourge that is domestic violence.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.555
Did you know because
of the curse of domestic violence,

11:19.638 --> 11:23.308
you could lose custody… of me?

11:23.851 --> 11:27.229
Every day, because of the evils
of our judicial overlords,

11:27.312 --> 11:31.358
countless innocent guns are in jeopardy.

11:31.441 --> 11:36.071
Never again will they shoot a bullet
into the sky just for funsies.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.700
They'll never get pulled out at a party
to impress a cool new friend.

11:39.783 --> 11:45.455
Some of these guns will never get to be
in a prom photo with your daughter's date.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.540
So I beg you,

11:46.623 --> 11:51.128
the next time your significant other
just won't fucking listen,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.297
I'm telling you, take a breath.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.134
Just fucking take--
Just calm the fuck down!

11:58.343 --> 11:59.678
For the guns.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.514
Can't you think of the guns?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.065
This is my dream episode

12:12.149 --> 12:17.029
because-- because I didn't like--
because I lived it. 'Cause I lived it.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.573
When we read the stats, I'm always like,

12:20.490 --> 12:21.825
"That's me."

12:21.909 --> 12:23.577
Like I'm the statistic.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.789
But the other really important thing
around gun violence and domestic violence

12:27.873 --> 12:29.499
is that people are always--

12:29.583 --> 12:32.252
There's, like, shame and silence,
and so then, nothing can move forward.

12:32.336 --> 12:36.006
You can't get the proper statistics,
and so the only way to combat that

12:36.089 --> 12:40.427
is to talk about it,
make hot content about it,

12:40.511 --> 12:41.678
-and…
-Hot content, baby!

12:41.762 --> 12:42.763
…that's right!

12:42.846 --> 12:44.765
And make jokes about it.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.062
Okay. Welcome back.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.399
We're gonna begin our discussion
with great news.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.985
Congress has passed a bipartisan law

12:57.069 --> 13:00.322
that prevents domestic violence offenders
from having guns.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.659
The bad news is
it hasn't been updated since 1996

13:03.742 --> 13:05.285
and it contains dangerous loopholes.

13:05.369 --> 13:09.081
Not only that, but it's often
up to state and local communities

13:09.164 --> 13:12.876
to enforce these existing laws,
which isn't always happening.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.504
And to help understand why,
we're going to have, joining us today,

13:15.587 --> 13:16.922
April Ross.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.132
She is a survivor, attorney,

13:19.216 --> 13:21.301
and domestic violence and firearms
advocate.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.887
And Janet Paulsen, also a survivor

13:23.971 --> 13:26.014
and an advocate who came to know April

13:26.098 --> 13:29.184
when they were both
in a physical rehab center.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.354
Welcome to the show.
Thank you so much for joining us.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.317
April.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.114
Tell us a little bit about your story

13:42.197 --> 13:45.951
and how you came to be an advocate
for this kind of legislation.

13:46.994 --> 13:51.123
I met my husband
when I was in high school.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.710
We dated off and on for roughly 15 years.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.590
I mean, he was always unfaithful.
He was always with multiple women.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.926
So January 2014, I moved out.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.303
I moved in with my parents.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.471
He always told me once we got married

14:06.555 --> 14:08.765
that there was only one way
out of a marriage,

14:08.849 --> 14:10.142
and that was in the grave.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.436
-He had told you that?
-Yes, many times.

14:13.145 --> 14:17.441
It made me nervous enough that I went
to work and I told our investigator,

14:17.524 --> 14:22.154
the paralegal, and one of the attorneys
that was working on the trial team

14:22.237 --> 14:24.072
that I was working on at the time.

14:24.156 --> 14:28.160
They then suggested that I go
and get a temporary protective order.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.164
And I thought about it,
but I decided against it.

14:32.247 --> 14:36.543
As a person who had helped
many victims and survivors

14:36.627 --> 14:39.505
get protective orders over the years,

14:39.588 --> 14:42.216
I thought I knew
what domestic violence was.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.384
He wasn't physically abusing me.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.012
But there was financial abuse,

14:47.846 --> 14:49.932
psychological and emotional abuse.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.808
-Right.
-But…

14:51.892 --> 14:54.394
He pretended to cooperate with me.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.938
He was gonna get the house.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.649
He was gonna get
half of our joint account.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.735
And we didn't have any children.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.530
And you don't feel a sense
of impending danger.

15:04.613 --> 15:08.617
-You don't feel doom.
-Not immediately.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.035
No, not immediately.

15:10.118 --> 15:14.248
The thing about relationships is that--
Even domestic abuse relationships,

15:14.331 --> 15:15.832
they start in love.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.961
So it's really hard to
reach the conclusion

15:19.044 --> 15:20.420
that it will end in death--

15:20.504 --> 15:21.588
in violent death.

15:22.548 --> 15:27.719
Most women who are killed
or almost killed by their abusers

15:27.803 --> 15:28.804
never see it coming.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.347
You can't see that coming.

15:30.931 --> 15:31.932
For me…

15:34.059 --> 15:37.688
I was taking a friend on an errand,

15:37.771 --> 15:41.400
and I was dropping that friend off
at home before I headed to work.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.444
And I was looking down for a moment,

15:44.528 --> 15:47.614
and then I looked over
in the passenger seat to say something,

15:47.698 --> 15:50.033
and before I could open my mouth,

15:50.117 --> 15:54.079
his body was right there in the window
outside the car.

15:54.705 --> 15:57.875
He didn't look down. I never saw his face.
I just saw his torso.

15:57.958 --> 16:02.546
And before I could blink, really,
and think of the next move,

16:02.629 --> 16:03.630
his hand was coming up,

16:03.714 --> 16:07.092
and I barely even saw the gun
before it went off.

16:07.176 --> 16:11.638
I just remember the pop
and the smell of-- the burning smell

16:11.722 --> 16:13.640
and every-- like, my head ringing.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.394
I got shot in the jaw through and through.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.149
I think I threw my arm up,
and a bullet went through my forearm.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.986
And I think I slumped over at that point.

16:26.612 --> 16:30.741
And another bullet went into my back,

16:30.824 --> 16:33.827
and that's the bullet that
paralyzed me from the chest down.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.624
He believed I was dead, and I think--

16:39.291 --> 16:42.711
You know, I guess I didn't have
the strength to stay conscious,

16:42.794 --> 16:44.254
but that's what saved my life.

16:44.338 --> 16:47.674
Because if he thought I was still alive,
he would have kept shooting.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.802
That's…

16:52.679 --> 16:58.894
incredible in how, like you say,
something that begins in love

16:58.977 --> 17:03.607
has such, you know,
violent anger behind it.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.779
Janet, your story is
unfortunately all too similar,

17:08.862 --> 17:10.739
but also with very different--

17:10.821 --> 17:13.367
-You saw this coming down a highway.
-Yeah.

17:14.326 --> 17:19.122
I knew that I was going to pay a price
to divorce him.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.041
I had been married 15 years and--

17:23.752 --> 17:25.753
Two children, identical twin boys.

17:25.838 --> 17:29.800
And there were some mental health issues.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.302
He had terrible mood swings.

17:32.386 --> 17:36.849
He was always getting into
shouting matches with people.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.436
I also-- Like April,
I wasn't physically abused.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.480
You know, that's such a misconception.

17:43.564 --> 17:49.027
For me it was emotional abuse,
sexual abuse and psychological abuse.

17:49.111 --> 17:55.325
And alcohol use really just
made those issues even worse.

17:55.409 --> 18:00.956
And it came to a point where my boys,
who were 13 at the time,

18:01.456 --> 18:05.460
came to me and they said that he was
drinking in the car with them.

18:06.545 --> 18:08.714
You know, so I went to him
and I said, "Look.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.592
It's time for us to get a divorce."

18:12.301 --> 18:14.553
And he looked at me and he said,

18:14.636 --> 18:16.972
"Why don't you go upstairs
and get the boys

18:17.055 --> 18:19.558
and try and leave
and see what happens to you?"

18:21.602 --> 18:25.230
I was like, "You're-- You're scaring me.
Why are-- Why are you saying that?"

18:26.023 --> 18:29.776
And he was like, "No. Go ahead. Try.
See what happens to you."

18:31.612 --> 18:33.238
The police and my attorney…

18:34.656 --> 18:36.491
told me I needed to get
a temporary protective order.

18:36.575 --> 18:37.576
Right.

18:38.327 --> 18:42.372
Now, he was a huge gun enthusiast.
There were 74 firearms in my house.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.916
-Seventy-four?
-Yes.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.294
Most of them were locked
in two big gun safes.

18:47.377 --> 18:51.173
But he liked to carry,
so he always had one on his ankle.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.468
There was one in his vehicle,
one in his desk drawer.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.303
And…

18:56.887 --> 18:59.264
It was granted.
I was granted that protective order.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.849
And they would come and take the guns?

19:01.725 --> 19:02.976
All but one.

19:04.853 --> 19:05.854
All but one?

19:05.938 --> 19:08.732
They let him leave
with the firearm in his truck.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.818
Yeah, she told me she couldn't get it.
It was a gray area.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.987
He shot me with it five days later.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.407
He ambushed me.

19:17.491 --> 19:22.746
He was hiding on the side of the house
with a gun holster,

19:22.829 --> 19:24.623
a Smith and Wesson 9 millimeter,

19:24.706 --> 19:26.708
and an extra box of ammunition.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.921
He thought I was at football practice
with my father and the boys,

19:31.755 --> 19:32.756
which we were.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.716
He was waiting on all of us.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.469
I just happened to come home early,
by myself,

19:37.553 --> 19:39.763
'cause I had groceries in the car.

19:39.847 --> 19:43.016
I was shot six times
with the 9 millimeter.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.978
He shattered my right femur.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.021
He shattered my left knee.

19:48.105 --> 19:50.607
I have a through and through in my thigh.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.318
I have a through and through
in my abdomen.

19:53.402 --> 19:55.737
He took out a third of my right lung.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.615
And then the last shot
hit my L2 vertebrae.

20:02.119 --> 20:07.875
One of the things that feels the hardest
when you're all discussing it

20:07.958 --> 20:13.964
is the concern that judges seem to have

20:14.047 --> 20:15.591
for the abuser

20:15.674 --> 20:20.262
and the concern law enforcement
seems to have for the gun.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.974
And it feels like more steps are taken

20:24.057 --> 20:30.355
to make sure that
the abuser's due process isn't violated,

20:30.439 --> 20:31.690
and their concern is,

20:32.274 --> 20:34.610
"Can't get the gun in the car.
That's the gun.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.487
-I don't want to overstep my gun getting."
-Right.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.823
Family violence
and domestic violence offenses

20:39.907 --> 20:41.533
are classified as misdemeanors.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.036
And when people hear
the term "misdemeanor,"

20:44.703 --> 20:47.164
they think nonserious crime.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.958
We need to get to point where
law enforcement doesn't have

20:50.042 --> 20:53.921
that kind of hesitancy or
lackadaisical attitude about--

20:54.004 --> 20:56.924
He should have been taken in
for the aggravated stalking,

20:57.007 --> 20:58.592
-which would have been a felony.
-Right.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.470
And he wouldn't have gotten bail.
He wouldn't have bonded out.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.556
And he wouldn't have been able to,
four days later, shoot her.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.645
So, I want to let the audience know,
in the dressing room,

21:09.728 --> 21:11.897
-your friend is back there.
-Yeah.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.691
-And she's just lost her daughter.
-Yeah.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.485
-To domestic violence.
-Yes.

21:16.568 --> 21:21.615
I thought the two of you had met
in some kind of support group,

21:21.698 --> 21:25.118
and she said, "Oh, no.
We've been friends since we were kids.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.703
I live right up the street."

21:27.246 --> 21:31.667
Her beautiful daughter was shot
and killed by her boyfriend

21:31.750 --> 21:33.544
when she was 19 years old.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.548
To my mind,
this is an unseen and unheard epidemic.

21:38.674 --> 21:40.968
And so we're gonna come back
and talk a little bit

21:41.051 --> 21:43.512
about how we gain control of it.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.180
-Yeah.
-All right, we'll be right back.

21:51.436 --> 21:55.858
So the Lautenberg Amendment
prohibits anyone in this country,

21:55.941 --> 21:58.944
regardless of where they live,
who has been convicted

21:59.027 --> 22:01.822
of a misdemeanor crime
of domestic violence

22:01.905 --> 22:04.950
from purchasing a firearm
or possessing a firearm.

22:05.033 --> 22:10.289
The federal law, however, does not require
or even speak to removing firearms.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.624
There's no federal reference to that.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.460
What people, from professionals
to the general public,

22:15.544 --> 22:20.382
could not wrap their heads around are
the steps and the actual logistical pieces

22:20.465 --> 22:21.466
that need to happen.

22:21.550 --> 22:24.344
Everyone agreed, yes,
this person should no longer have a gun.

22:24.428 --> 22:25.679
We agree on that.

22:25.762 --> 22:29.141
But how it actually gets done,
they just couldn't fathom it.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.435
Often, whether you are safe

22:31.518 --> 22:35.814
depends on where you live,
what law is in place in your state,

22:35.898 --> 22:38.942
and if you're in a county
that will implement it.

22:39.026 --> 22:42.696
One of the most impactful statements
that I have heard is--

22:42.779 --> 22:46.033
has been between
one police chief to another.

22:46.116 --> 22:48.785
When one chief was saying,
"Where do I put all of these guns?

22:48.869 --> 22:50.996
There's gonna be hundreds of guns.
Where are we gonna put them?"

22:51.079 --> 22:52.873
And the other chief just simply said,

22:52.956 --> 22:55.876
"The same place you put it
after he kills her with it."

23:01.256 --> 23:04.551
We're talking with
April Ross and Janet Paulsen.

23:05.260 --> 23:11.642
So, what allowed you guys to take this
trauma and turn it into activism

23:11.725 --> 23:14.311
and start to advocate for victims?

23:14.394 --> 23:15.938
How did this come about for you?

23:16.021 --> 23:17.856
For me, I…

23:17.940 --> 23:22.569
Almost instantly, the news was clamoring
to get to me when they found his body.

23:22.653 --> 23:24.154
-He killed himself.
-Right.

23:24.238 --> 23:25.948
He killed himself a few hours later.

23:26.031 --> 23:29.993
And so the victim-blaming starts
immediately.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.329
"She must have done something."

23:32.412 --> 23:35.791
And for me, oh, heaven forbid
there was a man in my car,

23:35.874 --> 23:38.418
you know, so,
"She must have been cheating."

23:38.502 --> 23:42.339
You know, "She was
at another man's house," you know, so…

23:42.422 --> 23:44.424
And it's almost that
"she got what she deserved"

23:44.508 --> 23:46.260
is the underlining message.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.594
I was getting furious,

23:47.678 --> 23:51.098
and finally I decided to reach out
to a reporter friend of mine

23:51.181 --> 23:52.182
and give an interview.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.893
What slowly starts to happen is,
you meet one person,

23:54.977 --> 23:58.105
and then you meet another,
sort of how Janet and I got connected.

23:58.188 --> 24:02.234
I was sent to her hospital room
as her peer support mentor,

24:02.317 --> 24:06.572
and, you know, I mentioned to her that
I was slowly starting to do some advocacy,

24:06.655 --> 24:09.032
and I was trying to find a way
to make a solution

24:09.116 --> 24:12.327
and bring some change
so that this doesn't keep happening,

24:12.411 --> 24:14.746
and, "Do you want to do it too,"
and she said, "Yeah, I do."

24:14.830 --> 24:17.207
I said, "I don't know what
we're gonna do, but we'll figure it out."

24:17.291 --> 24:19.543
-Right.
-"When I figure it out, I'll call you."

24:19.626 --> 24:21.003
Yeah. Yeah.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.880
-You proposed legislation…
-We did.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.882
…and it was not passed.

24:25.465 --> 24:31.597
In Georgia, we don't comply
with federal gun laws.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.016
So if you're under a protective order,

24:34.099 --> 24:37.936
or you have a domestic violence
misdemeanor or felony,

24:38.020 --> 24:39.855
you've lost your rights to firearms.

24:39.938 --> 24:43.025
But some counties in Georgia do.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.569
-I happen to live in one that did.
-That complies?

24:45.652 --> 24:48.238
All we asked for
was for the state of Georgia

24:48.322 --> 24:50.532
-to comply with the federal law.
-Right.

24:50.616 --> 24:54.203
And it's not just Georgia, by the way.
This is not to make it seem like,

24:54.286 --> 24:56.205
"Oh, yeah, in Georgia,
they got a real problem down there."

24:56.288 --> 24:57.915
-No, no, no.
-Like, this is everywhere.

24:57.998 --> 24:58.999
Yeah.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.961
What's the way to build this
so that women can feel safer

25:04.004 --> 25:05.964
getting out of these relationships?

25:06.048 --> 25:09.426
An officer had me
hold up a piece of paper,

25:09.510 --> 25:12.471
and he said, "Okay, that piece of paper
is your protective order,"

25:12.554 --> 25:13.555
and then he took a pen,

25:13.639 --> 25:15.891
and he jabbed through the paper
while I was holding it,

25:15.974 --> 25:17.017
and he said, "That's a bullet.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.520
You need to arm yourself."

25:19.603 --> 25:23.690
So, I went and I applied
for a concealed carry permit.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.527
I own a firearm,

25:26.610 --> 25:31.156
and I was trained by a certified
gun instructor on how to use it.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.991
-Right.
-And it actually, kind of,

25:33.075 --> 25:35.619
helped a little bit with my PTSD.

25:35.702 --> 25:39.498
Instead of me looking, you know,
at the barrel of the gun, you know.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.792
That image kind of changed.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.627
But, you know, that's not the answer.

25:45.546 --> 25:48.340
We can't solve this problem
at the shoot-out level.

25:48.423 --> 25:51.343
-No.
-The idea that if your husband

25:51.426 --> 25:53.470
had come in with a weapon
and shot you six times,

25:53.554 --> 25:56.598
that you could have outgunned him
seems ludicrous.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.851
-It's ludicrous.
-And if the police--

25:58.934 --> 26:03.480
the place you're going to
for protection is telling you,

26:03.564 --> 26:05.399
"We are deputizing you."

26:07.067 --> 26:08.610
That's giving up.

26:08.694 --> 26:10.070
In the prosecutor's office I worked in,

26:10.153 --> 26:13.740
with the investigators interacting
with police officers every day,

26:13.824 --> 26:18.704
there was not a true understanding
about domestic violence.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.541
They only see it when you get
somebody black-and-blue in the face.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.711
And that is not
what domestic violence looks like.

26:26.545 --> 26:29.631
It looks like a person
walking down the street.

26:29.715 --> 26:35.012
You don't need to see a person bruised up
to be able to agree or to acknowledge

26:35.095 --> 26:38.307
that they're in an abusive relationship,
or that they're in danger.

26:38.390 --> 26:42.102
And so, officers need intensive
domestic violence training

26:42.186 --> 26:43.687
as a part of the police academies.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.023
They need to understand
cultural dynamics…

26:47.065 --> 26:52.779
because everybody that they go to
for a call isn't gonna look like them,

26:52.863 --> 26:55.574
isn't gonna have the same
life experiences and background as them.

26:55.657 --> 26:56.700
So they need to understand,

26:56.783 --> 27:01.246
so that they respect the person who called
enough to take every call seriously.

27:01.330 --> 27:04.249
Stop worrying about if the person's
gonna get back in that relationship.

27:04.333 --> 27:07.544
On average, it takes a woman nine times
of trying to leave

27:07.628 --> 27:09.171
before they successfully leave
a relationship.

27:09.254 --> 27:13.675
And I can tell you, I'm above average
because I was--

27:13.759 --> 27:15.719
It took me a whole lot more than nine,
you know,

27:15.802 --> 27:18.472
-before I successfully left that marriage.
-I took two.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.308
It's even also to look at--
If you look at a harm reduction model.

27:21.391 --> 27:25.562
So let's say they overstep
on civil liberties, which, as we know,

27:25.646 --> 27:29.399
the police are not loath to do
in other situations, you know.

27:29.483 --> 27:31.818
They'll pull people over.
They'll do all kinds of things.

27:31.902 --> 27:35.489
Worse things worse, if it wasn't really
a situation that was warranted,

27:35.572 --> 27:37.574
you lose custody of your gun for a month.

27:37.658 --> 27:40.619
-Right.
-But if not, a life is saved.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.621
So how is that even in question?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.748
The argument you get a lot of times is,

27:44.831 --> 27:48.168
if you start here
with pulling back gun rights,

27:48.252 --> 27:50.629
or if you take these guns away
in this situation,

27:50.712 --> 27:52.422
then you'll just come up
with another situation

27:52.506 --> 27:53.507
-where you can take guns.
-Yeah.

27:53.590 --> 27:54.675
And then another. It's the--

27:54.758 --> 27:56.218
And then they argue
it's the slippery slope.

27:56.301 --> 27:59.763
It's not a slippery slope.
We're already at the bottom of the hill.

27:59.847 --> 28:00.931
Yeah.

28:01.765 --> 28:04.226
So what's next for the dynamic duo?

28:04.309 --> 28:09.481
We have received a federal grant
to build a family justice center.

28:09.565 --> 28:11.483
That's where you
fill out your police report.

28:11.567 --> 28:15.195
Childcare is there, legal advisers,

28:15.279 --> 28:17.865
therapists. All in one place.

28:17.948 --> 28:20.284
Janet, like she mentioned earlier,
lives in a community

28:20.367 --> 28:22.953
that has decided
to take guns away from people

28:23.036 --> 28:24.663
when they get a protective order
against them.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.790
-Right.
-That didn't just happen on its own.

28:26.874 --> 28:29.376
Even though I agree we need the state law,

28:29.459 --> 28:33.130
community-level changes
are a good way to start.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.007
Well, you guys are amazing.

28:35.090 --> 28:38.177
And I really appreciate you being here
and talking about it.

28:38.260 --> 28:41.513
I have a feeling you're gonna make
some enormous progress.

28:41.597 --> 28:44.057
-Hope so. Thank you.
-Thank you so much. All right.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.603
April Ross. Janet Paulsen.
We'll be right back after this.

28:48.562 --> 28:49.563
Thank you.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.986
You have a lot of the officers

28:56.069 --> 28:59.281
that don't believe
in taking guns away from people,

28:59.364 --> 29:00.490
and then you have to point out,

29:00.574 --> 29:03.869
well, more officers were killed
by DV perpetrators than any other group.

29:03.952 --> 29:06.580
You are not gonna see
a bunch of ATF agents, you know,

29:06.663 --> 29:08.957
running around
collecting guns on protection orders.

29:09.041 --> 29:12.377
They're usually looking
for bigger fish to catch.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.629
They're issuing protective orders

29:13.712 --> 29:18.300
but they're not taking the firearms.
The relinquishment's not happening.

29:18.383 --> 29:21.970
I think the biggest barrier
is roadblocks we have mentally

29:22.054 --> 29:23.764
with each individual person.

29:23.847 --> 29:27.184
So we drafted
a mandatory divestiture process,

29:28.060 --> 29:33.732
and believe it or not, in a red state,
they voted, and it was 96 to 0.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.693
Absolutely no opposition at all.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.695
I was floored.

29:38.779 --> 29:42.115
You know, we're doing it here,
in little old Lafourche,

29:42.199 --> 29:45.661
south Louisiana,
where everybody has firearms.

29:45.744 --> 29:48.997
Changing police culture
is like bending granite.

29:49.081 --> 29:51.208
I mean, you need heat, time and pressure.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.086
And you can do it
with all three of those things.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.925
The federal law is that
if you have a protection order

30:00.008 --> 30:02.344
or a restraining order, or you've been
convicted of domestic violence,

30:02.427 --> 30:03.804
you cannot own a firearm.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.639
True. Or ammunition.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.391
Or ammunition.

30:07.474 --> 30:11.728
But there doesn't seem to be
a dissemination of that

30:11.812 --> 30:16.191
into local and state-level enforcement.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.987
That doesn't serve their interests.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.907
Why is law enforcement not taking the lead

30:23.991 --> 30:27.703
and weeding out bad guys with guns?

30:28.871 --> 30:30.539
I would say that…

30:32.040 --> 30:34.751
a lot of the obstacles are cultural.

30:34.835 --> 30:40.340
As cops, we're human beings
who bring all of our biases to the job.

30:40.424 --> 30:44.469
So if we're a conservative white male
and a member of the NRA,

30:44.553 --> 30:48.599
you're already in the headspace
that gun laws are bad,

30:48.682 --> 30:51.351
everyone needs a gun,
and good guys will prevail.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.562
There's a certain portion
of that going on.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.772
But I would say it's not, you know--

30:55.856 --> 31:00.277
I think we have a tendency to say, like,
"Okay, a conservative white man,"

31:00.360 --> 31:03.238
but those aren't the only people
that dismiss women's concerns.

31:03.322 --> 31:07.367
It's a problem in rural communities,
it's a problem in cities,

31:07.451 --> 31:12.206
it's a problem in suburbs,
and it's all of the same dynamic.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.540
I agree with you.

31:13.624 --> 31:16.627
I mean, I agree with
how defeating this is.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.587
-Right.
-And we have to also understand,

31:18.670 --> 31:20.589
like, who are the actors
making the decision?

31:20.672 --> 31:23.842
We know. There have been studies done

31:23.926 --> 31:27.763
that show that for law enforcement
themselves, as people,

31:27.846 --> 31:31.642
there's higher incidence of domestic
violence in their own homes.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.310
People don't wanna say, like,

31:33.393 --> 31:36.563
"Hey, I had a bad situation
in my home that was violent."

31:36.647 --> 31:38.023
-Right.
-"And I'm worried, like,

31:38.106 --> 31:40.943
that person's mad at me, and they
could use this law to take away my gun,

31:41.026 --> 31:42.236
and if that happens, I lose my job."

31:42.319 --> 31:44.613
Like there are all these
other motivations going on.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.615
-Right.
-There's also this, sort of,

31:46.698 --> 31:48.325
throwing their hands up, saying, like,

31:48.408 --> 31:52.246
"Gun violence is a problem
that can't be stopped."

31:52.996 --> 31:53.997
Really?

31:54.081 --> 31:55.207
It's just gonna happen.

31:55.290 --> 31:58.168
It's part of the cost of doing business,

31:58.252 --> 32:01.672
no laws are gonna prevent criminals
from getting guns.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.006
Even if I took that gun,

32:03.090 --> 32:06.635
that guy could have gone out and bought
another one just that day, or built one.

32:06.718 --> 32:10.055
-Like, there's this frustration, like--
-But then why have any laws?

32:10.138 --> 32:12.349
Drunk driving was a problem,

32:12.432 --> 32:15.227
so we created programs
against drunk driving,

32:15.310 --> 32:20.858
and the police would set up
drunk-driving checks

32:20.941 --> 32:22.442
on the streets, right?

32:22.526 --> 32:23.610
And you could make the argument,

32:23.694 --> 32:25.821
"Well, that's a violation
of the Fourth Amendment."

32:25.904 --> 32:29.032
They did make the argument and,
you know, it was controversial,

32:29.116 --> 32:30.117
but it passed through.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.619
-So it's all about rewards, right?
-Right.

32:32.703 --> 32:35.163
So the federal government would send money

32:35.247 --> 32:39.001
to police departments through
probably transportation

32:39.084 --> 32:42.129
to pay for overtime
for those officers doing that.

32:42.212 --> 32:46.258
But we decided, as a culture,
drunk driving is a problem.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.342
Too many people are dying.

32:47.426 --> 32:52.431
It's a problem we're willing
to commit to owning

32:52.514 --> 32:55.559
and paying for to solve,
and there were incentives

32:55.642 --> 32:56.935
-to be good at it.
-Right.

32:57.019 --> 33:01.148
You got overtime, you're gonna be
given awards if you catch a lot of people.

33:01.231 --> 33:04.109
I mean, there was like--
It was carrots everywhere.

33:04.193 --> 33:06.486
Like, I think that's a model for success.

33:07.321 --> 33:12.201
How do you de-escalate
law-enforcement resistance?

33:12.284 --> 33:14.912
I think it's pretty clear now
that the federal approach

33:14.995 --> 33:17.998
is probably not the one
that's going to be very effective.

33:18.081 --> 33:21.543
We live in an environment where
we're not gonna pass federal laws.

33:21.627 --> 33:23.795
All right, so fighting that fight,
even though that--

33:24.963 --> 33:26.298
-I mean, we're not, so--
-I know.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.634
-So like--
-It's a funny thing to say out loud.

33:28.717 --> 33:29.718
We live in an environment--

33:29.801 --> 33:32.137
Especially when your job
is trying to advocate,

33:32.221 --> 33:36.350
and we do seem, to some degree,
able to throw money at problems.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.352
Police are strapped in their budgets,

33:38.435 --> 33:42.272
and so, if you can give funding
from the federal government

33:42.356 --> 33:44.983
that's coming outside the normal
local mechanism,

33:45.067 --> 33:47.653
and ask them
to do programs and priorities,

33:47.736 --> 33:51.240
people do what they have
the resources to do.

33:51.323 --> 33:55.619
And they don't need legislative, then,
approval because laws already exist.

33:55.702 --> 33:58.705
We have plenty we can do
with the laws on the books now.

33:58.789 --> 34:01.208
You know, the first thing I ask is

34:01.291 --> 34:04.294
would you have taken the same action
as a law enforcement

34:04.378 --> 34:06.004
if that woman was your sister?

34:06.088 --> 34:08.215
-Right.
-Like, wait, can we personalize it?

34:08.297 --> 34:11.217
And that's what we've got to encourage
police officers to do.

34:12.302 --> 34:15.556
Do you think domestic violence, then,
is not taken as seriously

34:16.139 --> 34:22.103
because the culture is sort of
trained to not believe women

34:22.187 --> 34:25.065
or to dismiss women's concerns?

34:25.148 --> 34:29.570
Because it does seem like
if this were happening to men,

34:29.652 --> 34:32.781
there'd be a far greater outcry.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.283
I think that's a fair criticism.

34:34.366 --> 34:36.702
And until that culture is fixed

34:36.784 --> 34:38.579
we will remain broken.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.915
The International Association
of Chiefs of Police,

34:41.998 --> 34:43.625
you're a part of that organization.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.545
Yes, and I was
on their firearms committee.

34:46.628 --> 34:50.507
Only 25 of this large-- this organization.
I had two terms.

34:50.591 --> 34:54.052
I wrote most of their materials
about gun violence prevention.

34:54.136 --> 34:56.346
The firearms committee is in charge of?

34:56.429 --> 35:00.475
All firearms policy that IACP endorses.
And I've been on it--

35:00.559 --> 35:03.103
-I worked there for years.
-Just out of curiosity,

35:03.187 --> 35:05.814
-how many women were on that?
-One.

35:06.690 --> 35:07.983
How many people are on it?

35:08.066 --> 35:11.153
Twenty-five. One person of color.
This is--

35:11.236 --> 35:13.989
-One person of color and one woman?
-Yes.

35:14.072 --> 35:17.659
Writing the policy for the IACP
on firearms?

35:19.745 --> 35:21.079
That seems fair.

35:21.788 --> 35:28.128
Yeah. And so, IACP is largely now
representing small-town police chiefs,

35:28.212 --> 35:30.297
rural chiefs, major-city chiefs.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.049
Has a very different look.

35:32.674 --> 35:35.260
-And, yes, this is shocking.
-But it's clearly a constituency

35:35.344 --> 35:36.970
-that could make a difference.
-Oh, yes.

35:37.054 --> 35:42.518
If they came out tomorrow as,
"This is an important initiative

35:42.601 --> 35:46.563
that we're gonna put
a good amount of resource and time to,"

35:46.647 --> 35:49.399
that would be enormous.

35:53.278 --> 35:57.699
Why is a domestic violence situation
not in and of itself

35:57.783 --> 36:02.704
-probable cause to remove firearms?
-That's a perfect example

36:02.788 --> 36:05.123
where an officer goes in
and takes that gun.

36:05.207 --> 36:07.793
This person says, "You just
violated my Fourth Amendment rights.

36:07.876 --> 36:11.630
I have a Second Amendment right to that--
you know, to keep that firearm,

36:11.713 --> 36:15.384
and I have protections
against unlawful searches and seizures."

36:15.467 --> 36:16.885
We had two people on the show.

36:16.969 --> 36:19.346
A woman named April Ross
and a woman named Janet Paulsen.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.890
Both were survivors of domestic violence.

36:21.974 --> 36:24.226
Janet got a restraining order.

36:24.309 --> 36:27.187
They came to collect her husband's guns.

36:27.271 --> 36:30.566
There was one in the car. She said,
"Can you please get that one as well?"

36:30.649 --> 36:33.527
They said, "We can't."
And he shot her with that one.

36:34.695 --> 36:36.488
A lot of times,
these orders are very specific.

36:36.572 --> 36:37.948
-They come from a judge.
-Right.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.742
Particularly when it comes to
Second Amendment rights.

36:40.826 --> 36:43.745
So they go in and an officer takes
that gun out of the car,

36:43.829 --> 36:46.373
they're gonna end up in legal jeopardy.

36:46.456 --> 36:49.501
It's about a protecting them
against a civil suit.

36:49.585 --> 36:52.713
So now, as a cop--
You know, Jon, what are they making?

36:52.796 --> 36:54.882
-You know? $60,000 a year…
-Right.

36:54.965 --> 36:57.134
…and now you're gonna bankrupt this cop

36:57.217 --> 36:59.469
because they're trying to do
the right thing to keep somebody safe?

36:59.553 --> 37:05.058
What that says is, their hands are tied
about enforcing laws that are on the books

37:05.642 --> 37:09.229
because they fear a legal process
against them.

37:09.313 --> 37:13.734
Does the will not exist to do it
because of that legal question?

37:13.817 --> 37:15.402
And does that play a role?

37:15.485 --> 37:18.447
Well, I know at the executive level
it doesn't, you know?

37:18.530 --> 37:20.199
At the line and staff level, I don't know.

37:20.282 --> 37:23.869
Do you still believe that it's possible
to do this at a legislative level?

37:23.952 --> 37:25.829
We need a federal standard.

37:25.913 --> 37:28.373
We need them to come in and say,
"We're not federalizing police,

37:28.457 --> 37:31.335
but we need a federal standard
that people can train to, can understand,

37:31.418 --> 37:33.670
that's evidence-based,
that makes sense." Right?

37:33.754 --> 37:35.839
But having those conversations
in those offices with people--

37:35.923 --> 37:38.717
When you look at 'em and say--
They're just not hearing me.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.512
-You know? It's extremely frustrating.
-Right.

37:41.595 --> 37:42.846
Where would you attack it?

37:42.930 --> 37:46.558
As someone who really knows it
from being a police chief at a local level

37:46.642 --> 37:49.353
and also having a good overview of it.

37:49.436 --> 37:50.562
What would you do?

37:51.438 --> 37:54.191
The game changer
for law enforcement has been

37:54.274 --> 37:56.235
those extreme risk protection orders.

37:56.318 --> 37:58.779
Does that differ
from a temporary restraining order?

37:58.862 --> 37:59.988
A hundred percent.

38:00.072 --> 38:01.740
-Temporary restraining order, right?
-Yeah.

38:01.823 --> 38:04.910
They're-- You have to really--
That's a high bar to get to.

38:04.993 --> 38:08.121
On an extreme risk protection order,
it's not a high bar,

38:08.205 --> 38:11.834
because it's a temporary separation
of you from your firearms.

38:11.917 --> 38:15.879
A woman can go in and say,
"My husband has been polishing his gun

38:15.963 --> 38:18.549
-and I feel like I'm in jeopardy."
-That's it.

38:18.632 --> 38:19.842
-"And I need this."
-Perfect.

38:19.925 --> 38:22.010
-That's a great example. Exactly.
-That would do it.

38:22.094 --> 38:24.513
Right now,
there's only 20 states that have it,

38:24.596 --> 38:26.557
and the District of Columbia, right?

38:26.640 --> 38:29.726
So we've still got, you know,
another 30 to go.

38:29.810 --> 38:31.562
And then the judge, you know, will--

38:31.645 --> 38:33.772
Would they be able to take the gun
from the car too?

38:33.856 --> 38:35.983
Yeah, under extreme risk protection,
they can take 'em all.

38:39.945 --> 38:42.614
I think part of the problem
with this issue is

38:42.698 --> 38:45.993
yes, it impacts women,
but what was illumining for me

38:46.076 --> 38:49.955
is that it disproportionately impacts
Black and brown women,

38:50.038 --> 38:51.665
-indigenous women, and--
-Trans.

38:51.748 --> 38:54.793
Trans women. And I think
that's also part of the problem

38:54.877 --> 38:56.503
that we need to actually talk about.

38:56.587 --> 38:59.089
-That we don't talk about.
-Black women are twice as likely

38:59.173 --> 39:01.300
to be shot and killed
by an intimate partner than a white woman.

39:01.383 --> 39:03.594
-Which is shocking to me.
-And insane.

39:03.677 --> 39:06.555
That's the other end. It's like,
do we not move on this issue

39:06.638 --> 39:08.599
because it's a bunch
of dudes affecting it,

39:08.682 --> 39:12.019
or is it because it's mostly affecting
Black and brown women?

39:12.102 --> 39:14.313
-Yeah.
-Probably a combination of both.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.565
Probably a hot combo with both.

39:21.862 --> 39:26.116
Thank you! Thank you so much
for watching the program

39:26.200 --> 39:28.619
while, I'm assuming,
scrolling Twitter on your phone.

39:28.702 --> 39:32.122
I cannot wait to see all 2,000 comments

39:32.206 --> 39:34.333
agreeing with everything we've said
here tonight.

39:34.416 --> 39:37.503
And, for even more, we've got a podcast.

We shall see you… next time.

39:54.645 --> 39:56.271
Have a good night. Bye.

39:59.691 --> 40:03.946
We are going to go.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.991
-I'm Niecy Nash.
-And I'm Thandiwe Newton.

40:08.075 --> 40:10.452
And we're the stars of a new movie,

40:10.536 --> 40:13.497
The Real Thelma and Louise.

40:13.580 --> 40:18.252
The premise of this reboot is to make
a real-life version of the classic.

40:18.335 --> 40:23.006
So first off, Thelma and Louise
are being played by two Black women.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.466
Our characters go on the run

40:24.550 --> 40:28.762
after Louise shoots
Thelma's abusive husband in self-defense.

40:28.846 --> 40:31.598
Thelma and Louise make it all the way…

40:32.474 --> 40:35.227
to the driveway before they are arrested.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.645
It's a pretty short movie.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.814
But, you know, fun romp.

40:42.401 --> 40:44.361
We do kiss once.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.445
Iconic.

40:45.529 --> 40:50.242
-Catch The Real Thelma and Louise.
-The original girls' trip.

40:50.325 --> 40:54.913
Take your white boyfriend
and enjoy the silence on the ride home.
