02:30.216 --> 02:34.320
It's two plus two
equals six.

02:36.854 --> 02:39.191
I will never tell you.

02:39.191 --> 02:40.393
But you will.

02:40.531 --> 02:45.728
OPERATION DUNKIRK

02:46.691 --> 02:50.191
Subrip: Pix

03:19.230 --> 03:23.703
<i>The enemy attacked us
on all sides</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:26.305
<i>with great strength
and fierceness.</i>

03:26.305 --> 03:29.275
<i>Pressing in upon
the narrow exit,</i>

03:29.275 --> 03:31.477
<i>both from the east
and from the west,</i>

03:31.477 --> 03:34.713
<i>the enemy began
to fire with cannon</i>

03:34.713 --> 03:37.316
<i>upon the beaches by
which alone the shipping</i>

03:37.316 --> 03:40.118
<i>could approach or depart.</i>

03:40.118 --> 03:43.688
<i>Meanwhile, the Royal Navy
with the willing help</i>

03:43.688 --> 03:46.257
<i>of countless Merchant
Seamen strained</i>

03:46.258 --> 03:51.296
<i>every nerve to embark
the British and Allied troops.</i>

03:51.296 --> 03:54.567
<i>Two-hundred and twenty light
warships</i>

03:54.567 --> 03:58.805
<i>and 650 other vessels
were engaged.</i>

03:58.805 --> 04:01.340
<i>They had to operate
upon a difficult coast</i>

04:01.340 --> 04:04.777
<i>often in adverse weather</i>

04:04.776 --> 04:08.714
<i>under an almost
ceaseless hail of bombs</i>

04:08.715 --> 04:12.985
<i>and an increasing concentration
of artillery fire.</i>

04:12.985 --> 04:15.355
<i>Nor were the seas,
as I have said,</i>

04:15.354 --> 04:18.456
<i>themselves free
from mines and torpedoes.</i>

04:18.456 --> 04:20.992
<i>It was in conditions
such as these that our men</i>

04:20.992 --> 04:24.463
<i>carried on with
little or no rest.</i>

04:24.463 --> 04:27.833
<i>For days and nights on end,</i>

04:27.833 --> 04:31.870
<i>making trip after trip
across the dangerous waters,</i>

04:31.870 --> 04:36.108
<i>bringing with them always
men whom they had rescued.</i>

04:58.997 --> 05:00.733
Attention!

05:00.733 --> 05:03.134
At ease.

05:03.134 --> 05:06.004
Lt. Calloway?

05:06.004 --> 05:07.673
This must be your lucky day.

05:07.673 --> 05:11.411
You're not being evacuated.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.911
You might actually
live another day.

05:12.911 --> 05:17.281
It's a ruddy
bloodbath out there!

05:17.281 --> 05:20.019
Gentlemen, battles
will be won

05:20.019 --> 05:22.620
by the side that
first spots enemy airplanes,

05:22.620 --> 05:24.689
ships or submarines.

05:24.689 --> 05:27.026
And British scientists have
been working feverishly

05:27.026 --> 05:30.329
to develop radar
technology that will see

05:30.329 --> 05:33.097
for hundreds of miles,
even at night.

05:33.098 --> 05:36.835
But they haven't been
able to crack it.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.337
Just recently, we got
intelligence from the Americans.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.806
The Americans?

05:40.805 --> 05:42.173
Yes.

05:42.173 --> 05:44.976
Seems a German scientist
has developed this technology

05:44.976 --> 05:47.779
but doesn't want
to share it with Hitler.

05:47.779 --> 05:49.714
I know.

05:49.714 --> 05:51.783
Whatever his reasons,
he wants to share it with us.

05:51.783 --> 05:56.288
Therefore, I need you and your
men to go retrieve the package.

05:56.288 --> 05:58.356
The package being?

05:58.357 --> 06:00.325
The German scientist.

06:00.324 --> 06:02.259
Do we know where this
package is, sir?

06:02.259 --> 06:04.428
Yes. We're being told
the French Resistance has

06:04.428 --> 06:07.832
the German scientist in a
safe house not far from here.

06:07.833 --> 06:13.206
He's being held here
in an old factory

06:13.206 --> 06:15.941
right off of L'Autoroute A25.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.709
That's 51 degrees north,
37 east.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.579
You're to go there,
rendezvous with the French,

06:21.579 --> 06:24.415
retrieve the package,
and get out.

06:24.415 --> 06:25.884
Any questions?

06:25.884 --> 06:27.687
Much enemy activity
in the area, sir?

06:27.687 --> 06:30.521
From our reports,
little to none.

06:30.521 --> 06:32.891
The French are
expecting you.

06:32.891 --> 06:34.826
Once you've made contact,

06:34.826 --> 06:37.028
they will ask you for
a piece of paper.

06:37.028 --> 06:39.230
Give them this.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.766
Sir.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.501
Any more questions?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.704
So we're not going to be
evacuated, then. Is that it?

06:45.704 --> 06:48.373
You have your orders.

06:48.374 --> 06:51.710
Pull your balls out of your
throat and be a soldier!

06:51.709 --> 06:53.611
- Yes, sir!
- Get your kit together

06:53.612 --> 06:55.882
and get ready to move out.
Do you understand me?

06:55.882 --> 06:56.983
Yes, sir!

06:58.884 --> 07:03.088
This mission could
not only save lives,

07:03.088 --> 07:04.557
but win the war.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.528
Carry on.

07:19.637 --> 07:21.606
You heard the colonel.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.742
Little to no enemy activity.

07:23.742 --> 07:24.843
We get in, we get out.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.012
We don't miss the evacuation.

07:27.012 --> 07:29.781
Just one last roll
of the dice, lads.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.121
Let's go.

08:32.443 --> 08:35.913
Should be just over
this field.

08:35.913 --> 08:38.116
Better proceed
with caution.

09:22.794 --> 09:24.697
Into the bushes!

10:02.967 --> 10:05.971
You must love your
family very much, no?

10:07.972 --> 10:09.975
Do you realize that
we know where they are?

10:11.777 --> 10:16.448
My soldiers are on their way
right now to pick them up.

10:16.447 --> 10:20.352
<i>Mein familia has
nothing to do with this!</i>

10:34.600 --> 10:36.134
No!

10:53.451 --> 10:55.520
Tell me!

10:55.520 --> 10:56.788
Tell me!

11:15.274 --> 11:18.677
Okay.
Okay.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.879
I give it
to a young woman,

11:21.879 --> 11:27.385
French Resistance
on her way to BAF now.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.996
Angelique!

11:43.500 --> 11:45.803
Show me where she is.

12:05.090 --> 12:09.360
They will see you
soon enough.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.444
Everything all right, Thomas?

12:59.443 --> 13:02.180
It's my son's birthday
in two weeks.

13:02.181 --> 13:05.584
I just really
wanted to see him.

13:05.583 --> 13:09.521
I haven't seen him
yet since he was born.

13:12.256 --> 13:13.691
Don't worry about it,
Thomas.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.927
You'll see him on his
next birthday, yeah?

13:15.927 --> 13:20.032
You can tell him what
a hero his father is.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.134
Never actually been
with a woman myself.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.068
You never been with a woman?

13:24.068 --> 13:26.137
Not intimately, no.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.608
So you've not had a shag?

13:29.607 --> 13:31.509
Such a romantic, Walker.

13:36.014 --> 13:37.283
Let's just find this kraut,

13:37.283 --> 13:39.485
and get the hell
out of France, yeah?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.286
What do you say?

13:41.285 --> 13:44.823
I hate this country.
It stinks.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.125
Lieutenant, all due respect,

13:47.125 --> 13:49.894
how do we know we can
trust this scientist?

13:49.894 --> 13:52.697
He is German, after all.

13:52.697 --> 13:56.033
Because cleverer men
than us have told us so.

13:56.033 --> 13:58.102
Well, they better be right.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.974
This must be it, lads.

14:05.309 --> 14:06.411
Stay sharp.

14:30.969 --> 14:32.571
Drop your weapons!

14:32.571 --> 14:34.639
Lower your guns!

14:34.639 --> 14:37.074
Lower your guns!

14:37.075 --> 14:39.011
I said drop your guns!

14:39.010 --> 14:40.978
Turn!

14:40.979 --> 14:42.314
Turn slowly to me!

14:46.884 --> 14:47.952
Turn slowly!

14:47.952 --> 14:49.654
What is your business here?

14:51.523 --> 14:54.393
We're with the British
Expeditionary Force.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.394
We've come
to collect a package.

14:56.394 --> 14:59.030
You should have
a package for me.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.532
Yes. Yes, I do.

15:16.748 --> 15:17.816
Read it.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.985
Read it to me!

15:24.489 --> 15:27.057
"The children long
to play in the fields

15:27.057 --> 15:29.360
but had to settle
instead for the sand

15:29.360 --> 15:32.530
which was accompanied
by an enormous roar."

15:32.530 --> 15:35.766
All right, where is he?

15:35.767 --> 15:39.070
How many are with you?

15:39.070 --> 15:40.472
Just the five of us.

15:43.207 --> 15:45.009
All right, where is he?

15:45.009 --> 15:47.679
She is inside.

15:50.014 --> 15:52.649
Wait. She?

15:53.885 --> 15:55.353
You did not know.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.455
No. I thought we were
collecting the chap

15:57.455 --> 15:59.257
with the algorithm
for radar.

15:59.256 --> 16:03.160
You were until
he was captured

16:03.160 --> 16:05.929
by Nazi but moments
before this.

16:05.929 --> 16:07.131
He gave the algorithm.

16:07.131 --> 16:08.465
To Angelique.

16:08.466 --> 16:10.134
Angelique?

16:11.436 --> 16:15.107
<i>-Oui.
-All right, let's go.</i>

16:42.700 --> 16:44.201
Angelique?

16:44.201 --> 16:45.370
<i>C'est moi, Pierre.</i>

16:45.370 --> 16:48.907
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.710
This is her.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.911
You have the algorithm?

16:52.910 --> 16:56.013
<i>- Oui.
- May I see it?</i>

16:56.014 --> 16:59.584
I have not written it down.
So you must keep me alive.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.218
Very sensible.

17:01.219 --> 17:02.921
Then we should leave.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.189
What's the plan?

17:04.189 --> 17:06.791
We must get her
to this location.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.526
They will further assist her.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.230
They have arranged a plane
to take her to Great Britain.

17:12.230 --> 17:16.968
But we must wait
for the Americans.

17:16.968 --> 17:18.936
They're already late.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.538
So I'm assuming the worst.

17:20.538 --> 17:21.740
We need to move.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.510
Shit! We've got company!

17:28.212 --> 17:30.816
So much for little
to no enemy activity.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.017
Take cover.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.751
I'll see if I
can delay them.

17:33.751 --> 17:35.619
All right,
let's dig in, lads.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.288
We were given a mission
and I plan on completing it.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.224
Harris, get me the colonel
on the wireless.

17:40.224 --> 17:41.492
Yes, sir.

17:41.492 --> 17:44.194
F13C here.
Come in, Dunkirk.

17:44.194 --> 17:46.163
F13C here.
Come in, Dunkirk.

17:46.163 --> 17:49.401
F13C.
This is Colonel Plummer.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.236
Sir, I have the colonel.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.175
We're at the destination, sir.
But the package isn't here.

17:57.174 --> 17:58.643
<i>There is a French girl
with the Resistance.</i>

17:58.643 --> 18:00.711
<i>Said she was given
the algorithm by the scientist</i>

18:00.711 --> 18:02.646
<i>before he was captured
by the Nazis.</i>

18:02.646 --> 18:04.514
<i>Has she showed it to you?</i>

18:04.515 --> 18:06.985
Says she has it
memorized, sir.

18:06.984 --> 18:08.452
Blood hell!

18:08.452 --> 18:10.054
That changes things.

18:10.054 --> 18:11.288
One more thing, sir.

18:11.288 --> 18:12.757
We also appear
to have company.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.025
How many?

18:14.025 --> 18:15.526
Difficult to say.

18:15.526 --> 18:17.495
Looks like a transport
heading our way.

18:17.494 --> 18:20.064
Get your asses out of there
before they arrive!

18:20.065 --> 18:21.298
<i>Those are your orders!</i>

18:21.298 --> 18:23.734
Understood, sir.
F13C out.

18:26.403 --> 18:28.205
You don't trust me?

18:28.205 --> 18:29.841
They've arrived!

18:40.285 --> 18:44.256
It's the Germans.
On the left and right.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.769
We know you are in there!

18:58.769 --> 18:59.904
Come out!

19:59.596 --> 20:02.032
She's in there right now.

20:02.032 --> 20:06.837
Yes, sir, but she has been
joined by five BAF soldiers.

20:13.878 --> 20:15.446
And they are
in there right now?

20:15.446 --> 20:17.080
Are you sure?

20:17.080 --> 20:20.917
Yes, sir. They just arrived
maybe four or five minutes ago.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.520
They are well-armed.

20:32.163 --> 20:33.397
And the Americans?

20:33.397 --> 20:36.867
No, sir.
I have not seen them.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.503
And she has
the algorithm for sure?

20:41.038 --> 20:42.540
<i>Oui.</i>

20:44.509 --> 20:46.478
What is he doing?

21:09.299 --> 21:10.835
Excellent work.

21:10.835 --> 21:13.071
Merci, sir.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.572
May I leave?

21:18.977 --> 21:21.146
You have five seconds
to run for your life.

21:21.145 --> 21:24.715
No! No, sir!

21:24.715 --> 21:27.885
Sir, no!
Please! No, no!

21:44.001 --> 21:46.437
Damn it!

21:47.538 --> 21:48.873
The traitor sold us out.

21:48.873 --> 21:51.009
Let's concentrate
on the task in hand.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.810
I count ten men.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.078
Same here, sir.

21:54.078 --> 21:55.980
Can we trust you?

21:55.980 --> 21:58.816
I risked my life
to fight the Germans!

21:58.816 --> 22:01.786
I watched as my mother
and father begged for their life

22:01.786 --> 22:04.355
and the life
of my brother and sister!

22:04.355 --> 22:07.659
They were only eight
and nine years old!

22:07.659 --> 22:09.727
They'll do the same thing
to her if we leave her.

22:09.727 --> 22:11.662
No one said anything
about leaving her.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.431
We heard the colonel, sir.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.400
You swear you have
the algorithm?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.968
It's all I have!

22:20.771 --> 22:23.340
We know you are in there!

22:23.340 --> 22:26.877
To the British
soldiers inside:

22:26.877 --> 22:28.245
Send us the girl

22:28.246 --> 22:29.748
and you will all go free.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.561
Otherwise, you will
experience the same fate

22:42.560 --> 22:45.364
as your French friend here.

22:50.567 --> 22:53.939
She will never give
the algorithm to the Allies.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.440
Ever!

22:55.440 --> 22:58.076
You send her out,
you will all go free!

23:03.949 --> 23:08.019
You have two minutes
to send her out.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.262
No.

23:18.262 --> 23:19.530
No, no, please!

23:19.530 --> 23:21.999
Please! Please!
I am telling the truth!

23:21.999 --> 23:23.067
Please!

23:23.067 --> 23:26.337
Please, you must
believe me! Please!

23:26.337 --> 23:27.838
Gentlemen?

23:35.546 --> 23:37.349
Speak freely, lads.
You heard the colonel.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.116
You know the mission.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.297
Well, I want to go home.

23:52.297 --> 23:54.699
We don't even know
if she has the algorithm.

23:54.699 --> 23:57.201
And how do we know
this algorithm can even do

23:57.201 --> 23:58.836
what people say
it can?

24:01.705 --> 24:03.641
Give her to them.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.009
How can we really trust her?

24:11.115 --> 24:14.719
I couldn't live with myself
if we turned her in, sir.

24:14.719 --> 24:17.888
Let's complete the mission.

24:17.887 --> 24:19.757
I've always thought it's
a soldier's duty

24:19.758 --> 24:22.026
to protect those who
can't protect themselves.

24:22.026 --> 24:24.895
Now there are ten of them
to our five,

24:24.895 --> 24:27.097
but we have
the elevated position.

24:27.097 --> 24:29.634
But, Lieutenant, they may
have reinforcements?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.301
Yes, that's quite possible,
Harris.

24:31.301 --> 24:34.304
But sometimes a man has
to take a stand on principle.

24:34.305 --> 24:36.908
No matter the consequences.

24:38.642 --> 24:40.111
I'm with you, sir.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.848
You say and I'll fill them
so full of lead,

24:42.847 --> 24:44.749
it'll be coming
out their eyes.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.562
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:57.561 --> 25:00.064
You will not regret this!
Thank you.

25:03.667 --> 25:06.002
All right,
Fritz, we've talked.

25:06.002 --> 25:07.705
We're not
bringing her out,

25:07.705 --> 25:10.007
so you're gonna have
to come in and get her!

25:10.008 --> 25:11.809
Fire!

25:22.286 --> 25:24.221
Pull out!

25:25.423 --> 25:26.958
Pull out!

25:30.561 --> 25:32.096
Patch him up, man.

25:32.096 --> 25:33.029
Am I gonna die?

25:33.029 --> 25:34.999
- No.
- Am I gonna die?

25:34.999 --> 25:38.236
Am I gonna die?
Shit!

25:38.236 --> 25:39.905
Am I gonna die?

25:53.483 --> 25:55.252
Damn it!

26:02.026 --> 26:04.162
Sir!
I have some dynamite!

26:04.162 --> 26:05.230
Let me set a trap.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.699
I'll blow these bastards
to smithereens.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.306
Schreck!
I've got a schreck here!

26:14.306 --> 26:16.007
God, then
we're out-gunned!

26:16.007 --> 26:18.709
We gotta get outta here!
Any ideas?

26:18.709 --> 26:20.510
Let's go out the back way!
I know the forest!

26:20.510 --> 26:22.113
King, Walker, on Thomas!

26:22.113 --> 26:23.380
Go!

26:23.380 --> 26:24.816
Thomas, let's go!

27:29.314 --> 27:32.083
Let's keep moving.
Come on.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.250
Chins up.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.324
That's it.
This way.

27:44.695 --> 27:47.197
All right, mighty forty,
everyone down here.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.862
Come on!

28:20.096 --> 28:22.400
Stay with me. Come on.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.103
We're getting out of here.
We're getting out of here.

28:32.676 --> 28:34.211
Come on!
Hold it together, Thomas!

28:34.211 --> 28:35.613
We've got to move on, man!

28:35.613 --> 28:38.115
We're working
on this together.

28:38.115 --> 28:40.384
Pull it together, Thomas.

29:57.361 --> 30:00.531
So any chance of getting
medical support for Thomas?

30:00.530 --> 30:02.767
The wireless was destroyed.
There's no calling anyone.

30:02.767 --> 30:06.537
Are you sure we can trust
this location that he gave us?

30:06.537 --> 30:08.338
<i>Oui.</i>

30:08.338 --> 30:10.773
I mean, he was working for the
Germans, it may be compromised.

30:10.773 --> 30:12.308
I don't think so.

30:12.308 --> 30:15.145
I don't think Pierre expected
us to escape. You know?

30:15.145 --> 30:17.414
Yes. You may have a point.

30:17.414 --> 30:19.615
Damn it, we need a radio!
We need to pause!

30:19.615 --> 30:20.917
I know a safe house.

30:20.917 --> 30:21.919
It might have a radio.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.087
- How far?
- Not far.

31:42.866 --> 31:46.837
- Shit!
- Sir!

31:46.837 --> 31:49.007
Sir, he's not doing so well.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.880
Sir, they're getting closer.
We'll never outrun them.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.348
Especially with him
in this state.

31:57.347 --> 31:58.949
Well, we can't
just leave him here!

31:58.949 --> 32:00.084
You are...

32:01.586 --> 32:05.256
You have to.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.458
I'm not going to make it.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.993
I know that.

32:08.992 --> 32:10.360
And you know that.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.397
This can't
be all for nothing.

32:13.396 --> 32:15.631
You said we could
be heroes.

32:15.632 --> 32:17.634
Now get her to safety!

32:18.536 --> 32:20.336
You're coming with us, Thomas.

32:20.336 --> 32:22.440
We're gonna get you home
to see your wife and son.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.911
You lads can do it,
but not with me.

32:26.911 --> 32:29.647
Not with me!

32:29.646 --> 32:32.916
You get home to England.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.651
You tell my son what I did.

32:34.652 --> 32:38.422
You tell him I was a hero.

32:38.422 --> 32:39.722
I shall.

32:39.722 --> 32:42.059
Reach into my pocket.

32:42.059 --> 32:43.292
- Here.
- This one?

32:43.292 --> 32:45.928
There. There's a letter.

32:45.929 --> 32:50.168
Please...

32:50.167 --> 32:52.669
Please give this
to my wife.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.005
You tell her...

32:58.409 --> 33:00.811
You tell her that
I loved her the minute

33:00.810 --> 33:03.447
I have laid eyes
on her.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.682
I promise.

33:05.682 --> 33:08.050
You keep that promise.

33:08.050 --> 33:10.120
I will.
I will, Thomas.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.657
All right. Now...

33:12.656 --> 33:16.660
Now sit me up
against that tree.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.470
And hand me my gun.

33:29.306 --> 33:31.475
You don't have
to do this, Thomas.

33:31.474 --> 33:33.076
Yes, I do.

33:34.711 --> 33:35.712
Now go!

33:37.448 --> 33:42.453
Monsieur, I'm so sorry.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.187
Go!

34:01.939 --> 34:04.375
Let's go.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.377
Come on, you bloody krauts!

36:34.257 --> 36:35.358
<i>Schiesse!</i>

36:50.041 --> 36:53.043
That'll slow 'em down.
But it won't stop 'em.

36:53.043 --> 36:56.247
If Angelique's secret is
as valuable as we think,

36:56.246 --> 36:58.681
- then nothing will stop them.
- It is.

36:58.681 --> 37:01.451
Well, at least Thomas has bought us
enough time to gain some distance.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.421
It's just north,
a few kilometers.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.121
Let's move on.

37:06.121 --> 37:08.458
Everyone stays alert.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.740
We need to rest.

37:23.740 --> 37:27.411
All right, let's stop
just for a moment.

37:30.079 --> 37:31.949
Be sure and conserve water.

37:36.318 --> 37:38.956
These blisters are
killing me.

37:46.163 --> 37:48.398
Sir, I've got
ammunition here!

37:48.398 --> 37:49.967
Stop! Freeze, King!

37:54.170 --> 37:56.939
Don't move.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.342
Shit!

38:02.144 --> 38:05.148
Is it booby trapped?

38:05.148 --> 38:06.450
Yes, sir.

38:06.449 --> 38:08.718
With a compression mine.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.722
Attached to a grenade.
A stick grenade, sir.

38:13.757 --> 38:15.459
Do you see where
it's connected?

38:15.458 --> 38:18.193
Yes, sir.

38:18.193 --> 38:20.396
About six feet to my left.

38:20.396 --> 38:22.799
Mr. King, I need you
to ever so slightly

38:22.800 --> 38:24.335
point to where
the grenade is.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.503
Don't move your head
or your hips at all.

38:26.503 --> 38:27.538
Do you understand?

38:27.538 --> 38:30.307
Just turn your
wrist and point.

38:55.498 --> 38:57.667
Do you see it?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.001
Yes.

38:59.001 --> 39:00.570
Yes, I see it.

39:03.239 --> 39:05.108
Could we cut the wire?

39:13.250 --> 39:16.152
I need you to stay
very, very still.

39:16.152 --> 39:18.988
We're going to get you
out of this.

39:18.989 --> 39:23.059
You have to absolutely
not budge in the slightest.

39:23.059 --> 39:24.695
Yes, sir.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.275
How bad is it?

39:38.275 --> 39:40.010
They've double-rigged it.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.713
There's a compression mine
under the butt of the rifle.

39:44.813 --> 39:47.050
As long as he keeps pressure
on that, it won't detonate.

39:47.050 --> 39:49.719
But the wire that's
attached to the grenade

39:49.719 --> 39:51.422
is already
under tension.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.492
We clip that,
the charge will blow.

39:57.327 --> 39:59.028
Shit.

39:59.028 --> 40:00.431
What do we do?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.121
I'm never going to be with
a woman now, am I, sir?

40:58.121 --> 40:59.389
Stay calm, Mr. King.

40:59.389 --> 41:01.724
We've got to do something.

41:01.724 --> 41:03.793
He's already struggling.

41:03.793 --> 41:06.063
Those Nazis can't
be too far back.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.735
What are you thinking, sir?

41:12.735 --> 41:14.871
The only thing I can do
is try to tackle him

41:14.871 --> 41:16.405
out of the blast area.

41:16.405 --> 41:17.873
That's insane!

41:17.873 --> 41:19.676
And keep your
voice down, man!

41:19.677 --> 41:21.411
We need to keep him
steady.

41:21.411 --> 41:23.278
Are you losing your mind,
Lieutenant.

41:23.278 --> 41:24.882
With all due respect, sir.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.849
Well, do you have
a better idea?

41:26.849 --> 41:28.217
If we had something
to dampen the blast,

41:28.217 --> 41:30.053
then that would be
a fine thing, but...

41:30.054 --> 41:33.824
Any branches we might find
would just add to the shrapnel.

41:36.592 --> 41:38.494
I think I can get him clear.

41:38.494 --> 41:43.433
Sergeant Walker, if you
would accompany me over here,

41:43.434 --> 41:45.602
we can deduce
the blast radius.

41:45.601 --> 41:48.239
What are best chances are.

41:52.242 --> 41:55.144
Appears to be a slightly
angled towards 11:00.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.782
This direction.

41:59.782 --> 42:02.251
A radius nearly five feet.

42:02.251 --> 42:06.222
Should have two to three
seconds before it goes.

42:17.233 --> 42:19.102
Shall we?

42:19.101 --> 42:21.038
Seek out cover,
Sergeant Walker.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.039
What are you going
to do, sir?

42:23.039 --> 42:26.175
Here's what we're
going to do, Mr. King.

42:29.913 --> 42:32.449
I am going to tackle you.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.784
You are going to stay
absolutely still

42:34.784 --> 42:36.753
until you feel
my body slamming into yours.

42:36.753 --> 42:37.921
Do you understand that?

42:37.920 --> 42:41.357
Pardon, sir?
What did you say?

42:41.358 --> 42:43.393
Tackle you, King.

42:43.393 --> 42:44.595
It's our only option.

42:52.568 --> 42:53.836
I don't want to die, sir.

42:53.836 --> 42:56.472
But I don't want you
to die either, sir.

42:56.472 --> 43:00.009
Maybe not. Just move on and I'll take
care of this. Don't worry about it.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.379
None of us is going
to die, King.

43:02.378 --> 43:03.746
I can do this.

43:03.746 --> 43:06.382
But I need you to let me
do the work.

43:06.382 --> 43:07.683
Do you understand?

43:07.684 --> 43:10.053
If you move, you cost us
precious milliseconds.

43:10.052 --> 43:13.723
Let me move you.
You understand?

43:15.525 --> 43:16.927
Yes, sir.

43:19.695 --> 43:22.365
When are you going
to do this, sir?

43:28.672 --> 43:30.740
I shall give you
plenty of warning.

43:30.739 --> 43:32.308
Don't worry, Mr. King.

43:35.244 --> 43:36.779
Maybe it's not such
a good idea, sir.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.882
I mean, we could always
just cut the wire...

44:08.911 --> 44:10.146
You all right?

44:14.650 --> 44:16.085
Damn!

44:18.255 --> 44:20.390
Sorry, sir.
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

44:20.389 --> 44:24.560
All right, that's enough,
I'm alive. You're alive.

44:24.561 --> 44:26.329
This is not good.

44:28.898 --> 44:30.066
Shit.

44:30.065 --> 44:31.634
What's the diagnosis, man?

44:31.635 --> 44:35.072
Well, the good news is
you've got a clean open wound.

44:35.072 --> 44:37.774
Probably some
shrapnel tearing through.

44:37.773 --> 44:40.277
The bad news is this branch.

44:40.277 --> 44:43.146
Not much bleeding
because it's an impalement.

44:43.146 --> 44:45.849
But could have lacerated
your femoral artery.

44:45.849 --> 44:49.753
And you'd bleed
to death internally.

44:49.753 --> 44:51.821
And how do we know that?

44:51.820 --> 44:53.856
You'll know.

44:53.856 --> 44:56.326
I'll just plug this hole.

44:57.327 --> 44:58.461
Stop the bleeding.

44:58.460 --> 45:04.033
And then if I dress
this branch to stabilize it.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.603
Just do as little as
you need to, Harris.

45:06.603 --> 45:08.771
We don't have much time.
That's an order.

45:08.771 --> 45:11.773
It's good the house
is not far off, sir.

45:11.773 --> 45:13.911
Quick as you can, man.

45:17.780 --> 45:18.949
Can you walk?

45:18.949 --> 45:21.818
Yes. I can try.

45:21.818 --> 45:23.487
Come on.

47:26.476 --> 47:27.943
This is it.

47:27.943 --> 47:29.411
How are you doing, sir?

47:29.411 --> 47:31.680
Still planning on
surviving this bloody war.

47:31.681 --> 47:33.615
Are you sure this
place is safe?

47:33.615 --> 47:36.219
I'm not sure about
anything anymore,

47:36.219 --> 47:38.421
but what choice
do we have?

47:38.420 --> 47:40.889
Let's go.

47:59.009 --> 48:01.545
Come in. Quickly.
Quickly.

48:05.181 --> 48:06.515
Come on, sir.

48:09.518 --> 48:10.820
Come on.

48:10.820 --> 48:12.956
Easy, sir, easy.

48:22.065 --> 48:23.132
You quite all right,
Mr. Harris?

48:23.132 --> 48:24.334
Yes, sir, just need...

48:24.333 --> 48:26.402
Let me help.
I was a nurse.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.405
I worked at Clemenceau
Hospital before it was bombed.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.773
You...
you have a radio, yes?

48:29.773 --> 48:31.141
<i>Oui.</i>

48:31.141 --> 48:33.543
But it only hails frequencies
from the Resistance.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.811
Well, I mean, is there any
way that the Resistance

48:35.811 --> 48:37.780
can get in touch with
the allies so they can

48:37.780 --> 48:39.215
let them know our whereabouts?

48:39.215 --> 48:41.351
It is possible.
I can try.

48:41.351 --> 48:43.419
All right, Harris,
you accompany our friend

48:43.418 --> 48:44.855
and see if you
can achieve that.

48:52.128 --> 48:54.230
Because this did not
hit an artery,

48:54.231 --> 48:55.565
we can remove it.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.434
And you know this how,
from your time as a nurse?

48:57.434 --> 49:00.269
I shall get
some boiling water.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.907
Sir?

49:04.907 --> 49:06.976
Thank you.

49:06.976 --> 49:09.045
I was just doing my job.

49:09.045 --> 49:13.615
No, no, it's much more than just
doing your job saving my life.

49:13.615 --> 49:15.351
You're welcome, King.

49:15.351 --> 49:19.655
So, how's it going with
the French Resistance there?

49:19.655 --> 49:21.090
No.

49:21.090 --> 49:22.459
It's, it's
not like that.

49:22.458 --> 49:24.161
I'm sure
it's not, sir.

49:41.777 --> 49:43.646
This was a
good field dressing.

49:45.481 --> 49:47.751
I'll just leave her
to tend to your wounds, sir.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.219
What?

49:50.219 --> 49:53.757
Nothing.
He's just being an idiot.

49:53.757 --> 49:57.661
He's just a little boy who
needs the love of a woman.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.461
Yeah.

50:04.067 --> 50:06.001
F13C, come in, over.

50:08.804 --> 50:10.605
Is F13C checked in yet?

50:10.606 --> 50:12.008
Negative, sir.

50:12.007 --> 50:13.809
Raise them.

50:13.809 --> 50:15.311
Yes, sir.

50:19.916 --> 50:21.918
Okay, this is going to hurt.

50:21.918 --> 50:23.318
I wish I had
some whiskey or...

50:23.318 --> 50:24.853
I never touch the stuff.

50:24.853 --> 50:26.155
- No? Really?
- Really.

50:26.155 --> 50:28.491
Why not?

50:28.492 --> 50:29.526
It's okay. It's...

50:29.525 --> 50:31.027
it's none of my business.

50:32.527 --> 50:35.864
My father was rather
too fond of the stuff.

50:35.864 --> 50:37.633
Wasn't a great man.

50:41.271 --> 50:43.439
You're a great man.

50:43.438 --> 50:45.240
No.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.509
No, I'm just a soldier.

50:46.510 --> 50:49.246
No. You are so much
more than that.

50:57.686 --> 50:59.489
I'm sorry. I...

51:02.092 --> 51:04.126
God, that hurt.

51:04.126 --> 51:05.561
I'm sorry.

51:05.561 --> 51:07.230
I thought it was better
to take you by surprise.

51:07.230 --> 51:08.965
Well, you certainly did that.

51:08.965 --> 51:11.968
Dear God, that smarts.

51:11.967 --> 51:15.371
Okay, put pressure on there.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.376
Hold it.

51:31.086 --> 51:32.789
Thank you
for trusting me.

51:49.105 --> 51:51.106
I'll say this
for these Frenchmen:

51:51.106 --> 51:53.210
they make
a damn good wine.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.146
I'm a beer man,
myself.

51:57.146 --> 51:59.181
When in Rome.

51:59.181 --> 52:01.016
Drink up.

52:01.016 --> 52:03.652
You never know
when you...

52:08.592 --> 52:09.659
Right.

52:19.902 --> 52:22.672
Have you really never
been with a woman?

52:26.376 --> 52:29.946
Well, I mean
I've kissed 'em.

52:29.945 --> 52:30.947
Lots of them.

52:30.947 --> 52:34.317
But, no,
not all the way.

52:34.317 --> 52:37.619
You're missing out, mate.

52:37.619 --> 52:39.288
Well...

52:39.288 --> 52:41.791
To me,
it's not just about sex.

52:44.559 --> 52:49.231
The more you have of a thing,
the less special it becomes.

52:49.231 --> 52:52.400
At least to me.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.336
I've always wanted it
to be with the right woman.

52:54.336 --> 52:57.574
Mate, they're all
the right woman.

53:03.146 --> 53:04.681
Hey, to be honest
with you,

53:04.681 --> 53:07.717
my first time I was
head over heels in love.

53:11.086 --> 53:14.958
We were just kids with
no idea what we were doing.

53:18.894 --> 53:20.396
But it was real.

53:30.706 --> 53:32.776
I can't imagine what I'm going
to tell Mrs. Thomas.

53:36.478 --> 53:39.214
You are going to tell her
that her man was a hero,

53:39.215 --> 53:42.586
and we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done what he did.

53:44.253 --> 53:46.589
And if you want,
I'll go with you.

53:48.657 --> 53:50.960
Thank you.

53:56.465 --> 53:58.367
You're a good man,
Mr. Walker.

54:00.168 --> 54:03.772
No. I'm not.

54:06.108 --> 54:07.876
But I'm trying.

54:11.847 --> 54:13.548
You have your moments.

54:13.548 --> 54:15.884
All it takes is one.

54:17.018 --> 54:18.988
One good one.

54:23.425 --> 54:25.894
You should wait
for the right woman, King.

55:18.914 --> 55:22.217
F13C, this is 7, 8,
Echo, Charlie, Papa.

55:22.217 --> 55:23.920
Come in, over.

55:23.920 --> 55:30.126
Again, F13C,
this is 78ECP.

55:30.126 --> 55:31.427
Come in, over.

55:32.829 --> 55:34.664
There... there's
no response, sir.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.999
- Keep scanning.
- Yes, sir.

55:46.809 --> 55:48.945
F13C here.

55:48.945 --> 55:50.380
Are you there, Dunkirk?

55:50.380 --> 55:54.016
Repeat, F13C,
are you there, Dunkirk?

55:54.016 --> 55:56.117
F13C here.

55:56.117 --> 55:58.453
Are you there, Dunkirk?

55:58.454 --> 56:01.222
Repeat, F13C here.

56:01.222 --> 56:03.226
Are you there, Dunkirk?

56:03.226 --> 56:05.027
F13C, come in.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.800
Keep searching.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.836
He may be using
a different frequency.

56:17.072 --> 56:19.173
<i>F13C here.</i>

56:19.173 --> 56:21.009
<i>Are you there, Dunkirk?</i>

56:21.010 --> 56:22.411
We have a signal, sir.

56:22.411 --> 56:24.679
<i>F13C here.
Are you there, Dunkirk?</i>

56:24.679 --> 56:27.649
F13C.
This is Colonel Plummer.

56:27.650 --> 56:30.052
<i>What is your sitrep?</i>

56:30.052 --> 56:32.255
Repeat, what is your sitrep?

56:32.255 --> 56:36.392
We're at a safe house,
outside the drop coordinates,

56:36.391 --> 56:39.027
approximately
four miles northwest.

56:39.027 --> 56:42.231
Good to hear
your voices, boys.

56:42.231 --> 56:43.398
What's your situation?

56:43.398 --> 56:45.734
<i>We've lost Sgt. Thomas.</i>

56:45.735 --> 56:47.635
<i>Lieutenant Calloway
is injured,</i>

56:47.635 --> 56:49.706
but we have
secured the package.

56:49.706 --> 56:51.875
<i>We're being pursued
by Jerrys, sir.</i>

56:51.875 --> 56:54.342
<i>We're possibly going
to need air support.</i>

56:54.342 --> 56:57.913
French Resistance have had
a change of plans, so we...

56:57.913 --> 56:59.849
we may have
been compromised.

57:01.083 --> 57:02.985
Where are you heading?

57:02.985 --> 57:07.524
<i>We're heading to an airfield
about two miles from the bridge.</i>

57:07.523 --> 57:09.891
<i>The package will be
flown to mainland.</i>

57:09.891 --> 57:11.726
<i>Sir, we're going
to have to pass through</i>

57:11.726 --> 57:14.462
<i>German-occupied area
to get to the airfield.</i>

57:14.463 --> 57:15.931
<i>We may need support.</i>

57:15.931 --> 57:19.768
I'll do my best
to provide some air support.

57:19.768 --> 57:23.673
Pop some smoke so
we know where you are.

57:23.672 --> 57:24.706
<i>One more thing.</i>

57:24.706 --> 57:26.275
What's that, Colonel?

57:26.275 --> 57:29.913
There should be a bridge a few
kilometers down the main route.

57:29.913 --> 57:34.150
<i>We have reason to believe there's a
German patrol operating in that area.</i>

57:34.150 --> 57:38.221
<i>That would put a group of French
freedom fighters in danger.</i>

57:38.221 --> 57:42.590
I want you boys
to blow that bridge.

57:42.590 --> 57:44.092
But with what, sir?

57:44.092 --> 57:47.696
Walker should have
the explosives you boys need.

57:47.697 --> 57:50.467
Roger that. Out.

57:55.771 --> 57:58.740
Tell headquarters we should
send men to the bridge

57:58.740 --> 58:01.277
and to the airstrip.

58:13.288 --> 58:15.057
We have more company.

58:29.471 --> 58:30.873
Quietly.

58:38.213 --> 58:39.447
That's gotta sting.

58:39.447 --> 58:40.583
Mr. Keller, do you drink?

58:40.583 --> 58:42.184
As much as I can, ma'am.

58:48.224 --> 58:51.126
This looks like
it's going to be fine.

58:51.126 --> 58:52.294
I'll live.

58:52.293 --> 58:53.596
We'll all will.

59:14.483 --> 59:17.853
Do you see any more?

59:17.853 --> 59:19.621
Let's hide the bodies.

59:24.494 --> 59:26.229
<i>Nein.</i>

59:40.208 --> 59:42.277
<i>Ja wohl.</i>

59:52.286 --> 59:53.455
You talked to the Colonel?

59:53.456 --> 59:55.824
- Yes.
- What does he say?

59:55.824 --> 59:57.460
I managed to give him
our coordinates and then...

59:57.460 --> 59:58.661
We're out of time, sir.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.396
Why?
What's... what's happening?

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.965
We just killed two Nazis who were
about to call in our position.

01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:04.967
- Damn it.
- Can you walk?

01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:06.568
Doesn't look like
I have much choice, does it?

01:00:06.568 --> 01:00:07.902
Come on, sir.
Come on.

01:00:07.902 --> 01:00:11.006
That's it.
All right.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.909
<i>Merci.</i>

01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:30.391
The airfield is
15 kilometers north.

01:00:30.391 --> 01:00:31.460
<i>Merci.</i>

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.728
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

01:00:32.728 --> 01:00:34.864
So, yeah, thank you
for what you are doing.

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:37.432
The Nazis are coming. You cannot
stay here, you know that.

01:00:37.432 --> 01:00:38.766
I know.

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:41.136
I'm going to try
and buy you some more time.

01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:43.773
<i>Merci.</i>

01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:47.009
Sir, are you sure you don't
want any of that morphine?

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:49.112
No, thank you, Harris.
It dulls the senses.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:51.480
Yeah, but so does having
a tree in your leg.

01:01:45.367 --> 01:01:46.369
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.805
No, no, no.

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:01.317
It's a rather nice day
for a stroll, isn't it?

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:07.889
And where is our French
little mouse strolling to?

01:02:13.728 --> 01:02:16.998
We can make this so much simpler
if you just tell me where she is.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Who?

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.971
What girl?

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:25.641
Bring him.

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:28.277
No, no.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.413
Wait. Wait.

01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:36.885
I don't under...
What is going...

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.929
I love the smell
of burning flesh.

01:03:55.864 --> 01:04:00.536
It reminds me of how,
as a little boy,

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:05.273
<i>my father would roast
a schwein on an open fire.</i>

01:04:13.949 --> 01:04:16.452
Now, tell me where they are.

01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:24.125
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:04:53.288 --> 01:04:56.157
Now tell me everything
or you will die.

01:04:57.092 --> 01:05:00.495
Okay, okay.

01:05:03.798 --> 01:05:05.934
Everything, I'll tell you.

01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:12.074
They are...

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.210
heading into the village.

01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:24.987
Now, why would they
be going into a village

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:28.190
that is crawling
with Germans?

01:05:30.891 --> 01:05:33.961
Ex... exactly.

01:05:33.961 --> 01:05:37.365
That is the last place you
would expect to see them.

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:44.740
Do I look,
stupid to you?

01:05:44.739 --> 01:05:46.608
Honest answer?

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.147
<i>Oui.</i>

01:05:56.451 --> 01:05:58.387
So be it.

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:06.861
For your information,
I know that the girl

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:12.401
is trying to escape by plane
from a small airfield.

01:06:15.903 --> 01:06:18.106
Not so stupid now, am I?

01:07:11.693 --> 01:07:13.496
Do you need to stop?

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.666
Perhaps just
for a moment.

01:07:25.273 --> 01:07:28.543
By my calculations,
we are here,

01:07:28.543 --> 01:07:31.346
so it should be just
beyond this next ridge.

01:07:31.346 --> 01:07:33.081
You're never gonna
make it on that leg.

01:07:33.081 --> 01:07:34.682
That's at least
another six miles.

01:07:34.682 --> 01:07:35.817
I'll manage.

01:07:35.817 --> 01:07:38.054
You may not have to.

01:07:40.688 --> 01:07:42.257
What do you mean?

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.095
Well, shit.

01:07:46.094 --> 01:07:47.495
Take cover.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:09.183
You know, I could probably
just pick him off

01:08:09.184 --> 01:08:11.586
from about a hundred
yards with this rifle.

01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:13.788
You snipers are
all the same.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:17.792
Trust me, mate, these blokes
will piss their pants.

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:19.862
Yes, well, we'll see
about that, won't we?

01:08:42.448 --> 01:08:44.319
Be ready,
here they come.

01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:01.970
Help! Help!

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.140
Help! Help!

01:09:05.372 --> 01:09:07.474
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.310
Please, no, don't shoot.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.911
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:12.648
Don't shoot me.
Please, no, don't shoot.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:14.682
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, please.

01:09:14.682 --> 01:09:16.652
Hello, mates.

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:25.528
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.265
I can't believe
that worked.

01:09:31.265 --> 01:09:33.100
What would you do
if a big bald bastard

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.203
tossed a grenade
in your vehicle?

01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:36.671
Fair point.

01:10:10.238 --> 01:10:11.405
It's quiet.
I don't like it.

01:10:11.405 --> 01:10:13.307
This should do the trick.

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:14.676
Once we destroy it,
that should slow them down.

01:10:14.676 --> 01:10:15.877
- Mr. Harris?
- Sir?

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:17.211
You stay and look out.

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:19.347
Mr. King, Mr. Walker, would
you kindly assist me in rigging?

01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:21.115
The pleasure would
be mine, sir.

01:10:21.115 --> 01:10:22.551
Come along, King.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.987
You seem to like
explosives today.

01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:35.989
How are we doing, gentlemen?

01:11:35.989 --> 01:11:38.092
Getting there, sir.

01:11:38.092 --> 01:11:40.095
Sergeant Walker?

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.762
A few more moments, please.

01:11:41.762 --> 01:11:42.864
Very well.

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:48.869
How's it going
down there, chaps?

01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:49.871
Almost done.

01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:51.507
Make it quick.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:58.247
Is this the bridge?
Here?

01:11:58.247 --> 01:12:00.148
The open space on the other
side of this tree line

01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:03.351
has a hangar-like structure.
It's got to be the way out.

01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:06.788
Sir, if I'm reading
this map correctly,

01:12:06.788 --> 01:12:08.422
then the airfield
should just be on

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:09.925
the other side of this forest.

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.859
- Where's Walker and King?
- Just finishing up.

01:12:11.859 --> 01:12:13.295
They should be up
momentarily.

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.596
I hope so.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.167
Do you hear that?

01:12:19.167 --> 01:12:20.569
That doesn't sound good.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.471
Doesn't sound like
a lot of fun.

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.072
Mr. Walker?

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.307
How are we
doing down there?

01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:26.774
Almost there, sir.

01:12:26.774 --> 01:12:29.545
Well, hurry up!
We have to go!

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:40.689
- Start the car.
- It won't start, sir.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.123
Quick as you can, man.

01:12:42.122 --> 01:12:43.791
It won't start, sir.
It won't start.

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.928
- Let's go!
- It won't start.

01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:10.050
Drop your weapons
and surrender.

01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:12.688
You have nowhere to go.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:15.590
It's a bloody tank.
Damn it.

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:19.761
This is your final warning.

01:13:21.729 --> 01:13:24.431
Drop your weapons
and surrender.

01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:27.101
Damn, it's a ruddy tank!

01:13:29.337 --> 01:13:31.305
- We'll have to go on foot!
- Let's go!

01:13:33.341 --> 01:13:34.643
Go, go, go!

01:13:36.377 --> 01:13:39.280
Fire!

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.144
Did you really think that
you could escape from me?

01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:45.981
We monitored
your radio transmissions.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.092
Are we good?

01:16:05.092 --> 01:16:06.028
We're good.

01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:20.774
I do not understand
how anyone could like

01:16:20.774 --> 01:16:22.944
such an inferior race.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.948
They're all like rats.

01:16:26.948 --> 01:16:30.051
Don't you know this?

01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:33.421
All they have
ever done was lie,

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:36.191
steal, and cheat.

01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:39.795
And you support them?

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:46.967
Now, we could have easily
slaughtered you Brits at Dunkirk.

01:16:46.967 --> 01:16:50.003
But we offered you
a second chance,

01:16:50.003 --> 01:16:53.007
a chance to align with us.

01:16:53.007 --> 01:16:57.311
Let's just see if your
Mr. Winston Churchill

01:16:57.311 --> 01:16:59.413
makes the right decision.

01:16:59.413 --> 01:17:02.917
If it were up to me,
I would have killed

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:05.820
every last one
of you on that beach.

01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:10.158
But you will all
die here today.

01:17:11.525 --> 01:17:13.295
Do you realize this?

01:17:17.597 --> 01:17:19.333
And I will decide how.

01:17:23.837 --> 01:17:27.574
And as for you, French,

01:17:27.574 --> 01:17:30.144
you disgust me!

01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:46.360
Now personally, I would love

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.296
to kill you
right here and now.

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:56.503
But apparently...

01:17:56.503 --> 01:18:02.376
You have some information in that
French little brain of yours.

01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:12.453
That is very valuable
to us.

01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:24.132
Now, I will ask you
one simple question

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:28.769
and you will answer me.

01:18:30.537 --> 01:18:32.807
What is the algorithm?

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:58.033
What is the algorithm!?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.202
Bitch.

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.575
I will count down from five,

01:19:07.574 --> 01:19:09.443
and then you will tell me
the algorithm.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.547
Okay. I will tell you!
I will tell you.

01:19:13.547 --> 01:19:14.815
Don't tell him anything!

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:20.122
<i>Zwei.</i>

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.057
<i>Eins.</i>

01:20:34.395 --> 01:20:36.497
You go on ahead.
I'll catch you up.

01:20:36.497 --> 01:20:37.698
Let me help you, sir.

01:20:44.605 --> 01:20:46.140
Fire!

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.512
Cover and fire!

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:10.030
Take cover!

01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:35.389
You all right, Mr. King?

01:21:35.389 --> 01:21:37.458
Yes, sir, just a nick.
I'm fine.

01:21:39.859 --> 01:21:41.896
All right.
Stay low. Stay low.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.033
We need to slow them down.

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.992
You have nowhere to go!

01:22:11.992 --> 01:22:13.929
Surrender!

01:22:15.529 --> 01:22:17.965
More tension.
More tension.

01:22:19.699 --> 01:22:24.471
Surrender and give us the girl
and you will all go free.

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:30.944
You will not escape.

01:22:30.944 --> 01:22:33.514
You will not get away.

01:22:33.514 --> 01:22:36.217
No one's going
to surrender, Fritz.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.659
How we doing, lads?

01:22:44.658 --> 01:22:46.694
One minute.

01:22:59.006 --> 01:23:01.175
Surrender!

01:23:01.175 --> 01:23:03.278
Okay, we're so close.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.445
Ready, sir.

01:23:05.445 --> 01:23:07.247
You will not
get out of there.

01:23:07.247 --> 01:23:09.583
Lay down covering fire
and move on my three,

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:11.985
two, one... fire!

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.226
Shit.

01:23:19.225 --> 01:23:20.527
Move!

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.731
Move! Move!

01:23:24.832 --> 01:23:26.634
Go, go, go.

01:25:02.762 --> 01:25:04.731
For King and country.

01:25:04.731 --> 01:25:06.701
I'm willing to bet
Fritz is still coming.

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:08.302
So let's go.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.445
Where is the plane?

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:18.746
It's supposed to be here.

01:25:27.688 --> 01:25:29.289
No!

01:25:48.842 --> 01:25:50.444
You have nowhere to go!

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:58.386
Surrender.

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:02.156
Brother by my side,
what do you want to do?

01:26:02.155 --> 01:26:04.057
I have one magazine left.

01:26:04.057 --> 01:26:05.792
No. No.

01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:07.927
Drop your weapons.

01:26:07.927 --> 01:26:09.663
Do it now!

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:17.205
You are totally surrounded.

01:26:19.939 --> 01:26:21.675
Bloody hell, I'm not
going out like this.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.878
- No!
- Stand down, Sergeant Walker.

01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:25.679
It's our only chance.

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:32.252
I'm sorry, Angelique.

01:26:32.252 --> 01:26:34.121
We did all we could.

01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:35.521
Please, no.
Please, no.

01:26:35.521 --> 01:26:36.791
Please don't give up hope.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:39.527
It wasn't supposed
to end like this.

01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:42.863
Fire.

01:26:44.164 --> 01:26:46.266
Look. Look!

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.975
It's our boys.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.877
It's about bloody time.

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.690
<i>Schiesse.</i>

01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:45.993
<i>Schiesse.</i>

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.016
See, you never
give up hope.

01:28:44.016 --> 01:28:45.586
We did it.

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.622
God save the King.

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:52.026
We did it.
We did it!

01:29:00.734 --> 01:29:02.069
Let's get her to that plane.

01:29:02.069 --> 01:29:04.839
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

01:29:50.216 --> 01:29:51.853
Thank you.

01:29:53.319 --> 01:29:54.855
Thank you.

01:29:56.756 --> 01:29:58.291
I'm sorry for your men.

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:00.728
But thank you for my life.

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:03.431
I just hope it
was worth it, love.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.599
It is.

01:30:10.604 --> 01:30:12.306
Could you do us a favor?

01:30:12.305 --> 01:30:15.741
When you get back to London,
find Emily Thomas.

01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.878
Give her this letter.

01:30:17.877 --> 01:30:19.913
I don't think I'll be around
to give it to her.

01:30:19.913 --> 01:30:22.114
And I'd rather she got it
sooner than later.

01:30:22.114 --> 01:30:23.518
Of course.

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.118
Thank you.

01:30:29.823 --> 01:30:32.659
Let's get you on that plane.

01:30:32.659 --> 01:30:34.662
Are you all right?

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.430
You?

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.532
I'm alive.

01:30:38.532 --> 01:30:40.902
I don't know how,
but I am.

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.936
You must never
give up hope.

01:30:42.936 --> 01:30:46.506
It doesn't matter how,
it matters why.

01:30:46.506 --> 01:30:49.141
You are a special man,
Lieutenant.

01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:50.711
You have a purpose.

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:53.012
You must trust that.

01:30:53.012 --> 01:30:54.782
Thank you.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.717
Those men died heroes.

01:30:57.717 --> 01:30:59.854
Is there a better way
to serve your country?

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:01.454
None.

01:31:01.454 --> 01:31:03.356
What will you do now?

01:31:03.356 --> 01:31:05.126
Will I see you again?

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.463
This war is
far from over.

01:31:09.462 --> 01:31:14.400
I'll just have to enjoy the
beauty this world has to offer.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.072
When one remembers to
look beyond the ugliness.

01:31:34.454 --> 01:31:36.222
I'll see you in London.

01:31:36.222 --> 01:31:38.993
Now, let's get you
on that plane.

01:32:28.975 --> 01:32:30.743
I think she
likes you, sir.

01:32:30.743 --> 01:32:33.045
