WEBVTT

00:05.367 --> 00:06.333
- What's your dream?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.433
- My dream is to become
a fantasy character.

00:08.467 --> 00:13.133
I specifically focused my
transformation in space elves.

00:13.166 --> 00:16.066
And I will do anything
to achieve that dream.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.500
- You are willing
to risk blindness

00:17.567 --> 00:19.000
to have your
eye color changed?

00:19.033 --> 00:21.266
- Yes, no risk, no gain.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.333
- That's scary.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.600
[ethereal growl]

00:24.667 --> 00:26.367
- I started feeling
this sharp pain.

00:26.433 --> 00:29.066
My implant was
all the way in my armpit.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.433
It ripped all the way
through the pocket.

00:30.467 --> 00:33.200
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

00:33.266 --> 00:34.200
- It sits there like that.

00:34.266 --> 00:35.266
That's what I'm talking about.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.400
- That is weird.

00:37.467 --> 00:40.066
- I've had four accidents
and 14 surgeries.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.433
- Whoa.
- Oh.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.567
- She looks like she's been
in multiple fights.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.600
And you're hoping
that the 15th surgery...

00:46.633 --> 00:48.100
- Is the winner.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.400
- I have to tell you,
I'm scared.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.166
There's a lot of red flags,
and I'm scared.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.367
- I've never seen him scared.

00:52.433 --> 00:54.033
- Then I'm scared too.

00:54.066 --> 00:57.166
- ♪ I want to be sexy ♪

00:57.200 --> 00:59.433
♪ I want to be hot ♪

00:59.467 --> 01:04.266
♪ Fix me, make me beautiful ♪

01:04.333 --> 01:07.033
♪ I want to be perfect ♪

01:07.066 --> 01:08.033
- I am Luis.

01:08.066 --> 01:09.166
I am 25 years old,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.066
and I'm from Argentina.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.433
I am in a quest to become
a perfect-looking elf.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.567
Since a young age,
I always loved fantasy movies,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.567
like "Labyrinth"
and "NeverEnding Story."

01:19.600 --> 01:23.133
I started to dye my hair
green, blue, white,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.033
because I liked being colorful

01:25.100 --> 01:27.200
like the characters
in the movies.

01:27.233 --> 01:30.066
And I started to learn
about plastic surgery.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.467
That was the time
when I decided

01:32.500 --> 01:34.533
that I wanted to change myself.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.066
I am not a Keebler Elf.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.233
I am not a Elf in the Shelf.

01:38.266 --> 01:43.633
I specifically focused my
transformation in space elves.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.066
They are warriors
of love and light,

01:46.100 --> 01:48.333
and they protect the earth
from evil aliens

01:48.367 --> 01:49.600
and stuff like that.

01:49.633 --> 01:52.467
They are very pale
with big eyes,

01:52.500 --> 01:55.467
small features,
long white hair.

01:55.500 --> 02:00.200
It is the kind of beauty
that I want to have--ethereal.

02:00.233 --> 02:01.367
Some years ago,

02:02.467 --> 02:04.633
I learned that you can change
your eye color by laser.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.600
It was experimental,
but I decided to do it anyway.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.633
I wanted to have purple eyes
like elves,

02:09.667 --> 02:13.333
but I ended up dark gray,
and I didn't like it at all.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.300
So now I have a collection
of 500 contact lenses,

02:17.367 --> 02:21.233
fantastic colors, like black
to look like a daemon

02:21.266 --> 02:23.266
or white to look like an angel.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.700
The main thing I wanted
to change was my nose.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.667
When I saw the doctor
for the first time,

02:27.700 --> 02:30.633
I told her that I wanted
to have a nose

02:30.667 --> 02:33.500
that doesn't look human at all,

02:33.533 --> 02:35.667
a small and pointy nose.

02:35.700 --> 02:41.233
She was kind of, mm...
not much happy with it.

02:41.266 --> 02:43.533
but we go for it anyway.

02:43.567 --> 02:47.300
I did my nose surgery
and my jaw liposuction

02:47.333 --> 02:48.433
at the same time.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.600
When I had
my jaw liposuctioned,

02:50.667 --> 02:53.667
I wanted to fix family features
that we have.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.667
We are very skinny,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.400
but we have a lot of baby fat
on the neck.

02:57.433 --> 03:00.400
But, sadly, the result
is not the perfect,

03:00.433 --> 03:03.266
small, elfin face
that I wanted to have.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.266
I want to see Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

03:05.300 --> 03:06.533
because they are perfect

03:06.567 --> 03:08.700
to fix the things
that I have done to my face.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.533
I want my nose to be smaller,

03:10.567 --> 03:14.333
my jaw to be smaller
and more symmetric.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.266
I want to fulfill my dreams
and reach my goals.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.567
I'm not elfing around
with being an elf.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.667
[ethereal growl]

03:22.700 --> 03:24.567
[upbeat music]

03:24.600 --> 03:26.166
- My name is Stacie,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.567
and my nose has been
smashed and bashed.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.467
I've had four accidents
and 14 surgeries.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.333
I grew up
in Oak Park, Michigan.

03:35.367 --> 03:36.600
It was a nice life.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.700
Then, when I was 10 years old,

03:38.734 --> 03:40.734
I was hit in the face
with a basketball.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.367
I saw stars,
and my nose was swollen

03:43.433 --> 03:45.367
and bleeding and sideways.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.166
But the ER doctor said

03:47.200 --> 03:49.166
that I would just have
to bear with it

03:49.200 --> 03:50.467
until I was old enough

03:50.500 --> 03:52.467
to actually have it
surgically repaired.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.700
After getting hit
with the basketball,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.700
I thought I was so ugly,

03:55.734 --> 03:58.734
and that is what started
these crazy surgeries.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.300
When I was 15 years old,

04:00.333 --> 04:02.600
my mother and I met
with a surgeon.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.567
We learned that he did
sex change operations.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.500
And we figured that if he could
change a man into a woman,

04:08.533 --> 04:11.333
he could do a decent nose.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.333
We didn't know.

04:12.367 --> 04:13.367
After my first surgery,

04:14.367 --> 04:16.500
my nose looked exactly the same
as it did before.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.333
My mother and I
went back to the surgeon.

04:18.367 --> 04:19.600
I had two more revisions,

04:21.033 --> 04:23.467
but I was still uncomfortable
with the way I looked.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.667
I wanted to have a nose
that I liked.

04:25.734 --> 04:27.467
It was vanity.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.533
When I was 19 years old,
I saw another doctor.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.467
There were about
three more revisions.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.533
When I was around 23 years old,
I saw another doctor.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.767
There were about
three more revisions.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.467
After the ninth surgery,

04:41.500 --> 04:43.734
there was finally
some improvement.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.734
When I was 32,
I was in another accident.

04:46.767 --> 04:51.767
I was catching a little boy
as he was sliding down a slide.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.500
He hit me in the nose
with his forehead.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.633
It was bleeding,
and it was crooked,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.633
and I knew I needed
another surgery.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.600
And I had four more revisions.

05:02.667 --> 05:03.700
My nose looked better

05:04.767 --> 05:06.633
than I had remembered it
ever looking.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.633
Then I am unlucky,

05:08.667 --> 05:12.767
because in 2015
I was in a car accident,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.767
and I hit my face
on the steering wheel.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.767
My nose was broken.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.734
I am just
a really unlucky person.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.433
- Hey, Stace.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.633
- Rach, hi, how are you?

05:27.667 --> 05:28.633
- Who's this?

05:28.667 --> 05:29.633
- This is JJ.

05:29.667 --> 05:30.667
- Oh, she's beautiful.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.667
- She's a good girl.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.700
My life now
is really wonderful.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.266
I have a loving husband,

05:36.300 --> 05:37.734
beautiful, healthy children,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.667
and I work with people
with disabilities

05:40.700 --> 05:42.367
and teach them
how to ride horses.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.533
- What's going on, sister?

05:43.567 --> 05:44.533
- I have so many things
to tell you.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.266
So, after the accident,

05:46.300 --> 05:49.667
this part of my nose
seems like it's collapsed.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.266
I went to see a doctor.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.533
He walked in the room, Rach,
and said to me,

05:53.567 --> 05:54.667
"You look like an Avatar.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.333
You know, those blue monsters?"

05:56.400 --> 05:57.467
- Oh, my god.

05:57.533 --> 05:58.567
- It really hurt my feelings.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.533
But it also made me think,

06:00.433 --> 06:02.667
wow, do I look a lot worse
than I realize?

06:02.700 --> 06:05.000
I think having a surgery
with Dr. Nassif

06:05.033 --> 06:08.700
is my last shot
at having a good-looking nose.

06:08.734 --> 06:11.633
I want to see Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow,

06:11.700 --> 06:15.033
hoping they can make me
not look like an Avatar.

06:15.066 --> 06:17.567
- I've known Stacie
for over 35 years,

06:17.600 --> 06:19.333
but her nose
has always bothered her.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.100
She doesn't want that to be
the thing that people notice

06:21.166 --> 06:22.700
when she walks in a room.

06:22.734 --> 06:25.533
I hope and pray that this
is the end of this black cloud.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.533
- I'm excited, you know?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.033
I'm really excited.

06:31.734 --> 06:32.500
- What do we have?

06:32.567 --> 06:34.567
- We have to zhoosh
this patient.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.700
This lovely lady's name
is Stacie.

06:36.734 --> 06:38.066
So, from there,
it looks a little wide.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.066
- Yeah.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.700
- Whoa.
- Oh.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.667
- You know, she looks
like a boxer.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
She looks like she's been
in multiple fights.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.767
- I think we need
a lot of history,

06:46.033 --> 06:47.700
and we need a darn good
physical exam.

06:47.734 --> 06:50.667
Can you please send in Stacie?

06:50.734 --> 06:52.367
- Hi.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.300
- Nice to meet you,
Dr. Nassif.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.633
- I'm very excited
to meet with the doctors.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.433
I want Dr. Nassif to say,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.633
"I can help you
with everything, 100%."

07:02.667 --> 07:04.066
I am asking for a miracle.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.133
- I think what we really need

07:05.200 --> 07:07.600
is a very detailed story
from you

07:07.633 --> 07:09.767
of exactly how
you ended up here.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.734
- When I was 10, I got nailed
in the face with a basketball,

07:11.767 --> 07:13.000
and my nose broke.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.333
When I was 15,
I had the surgery

07:15.367 --> 07:17.066
and looked exactly the same.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.333
When I was 16,
we did the second one.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.767
When I was 18,
I did the third with him.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.600
- Same doctor?
- Same doctor.

07:22.633 --> 07:25.533
- It maybe looked
a teeny bit smaller,

07:25.600 --> 07:26.533
but it never felt right.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.633
So I went to see
the same doctor who did her,

07:29.667 --> 07:31.600
and he did surgery,

07:31.633 --> 07:33.734
and there were a couple
revisions involved there also.

07:33.767 --> 07:36.100
And then, when I was 24,
I went with a friend

07:36.133 --> 07:37.433
to see another doctor.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.667
He did a surgery,
couple more revisions.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.367
- So, what number
are we at here?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.767
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

07:43.000 --> 07:43.734
- And how old are you, 25?

07:44.000 --> 07:44.700
- 25, yeah.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.166
- I've never heard
of a patient

07:47.400 --> 07:50.367
having nine rhinoplasties
in the span of nine years.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.500
But what's even more concerning

07:52.533 --> 07:55.667
is that none of those
plastic surgeons told her

07:55.700 --> 07:58.767
to stop having plastic surgery.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.100
- Then, I was pregnant
with my second daughter,

08:01.133 --> 08:03.767
and catching a little boy
on a slide,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.667
and he came
down that slide fast,

08:05.700 --> 08:07.500
and that forehead...

08:07.533 --> 08:08.667
- Right here again.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.767
- It was crooked
and bleeding daily,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.100
so I had to get it fixed.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.667
- So this is surgery
number ten.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.567
- Surgery number ten,
and four revisions.

08:16.633 --> 08:19.033
So I was glad
that that was done.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.033
And I was like, okay,
I'm done now, here's my nose.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.000
And then, when I was just
almost turning 40,

08:25.033 --> 08:26.533
and I was going straight
through a green light,

08:26.567 --> 08:28.767
and a girl turned
in front of me.

08:29.033 --> 08:32.000
And I smashed into her,
and my airbag didn't go off.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.667
And my seatbelt didn't lock.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.533
- And you hit your nose.

08:35.400 --> 08:35.667
- This side
hit the steering wheel.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.400
It was a mess.

08:37.433 --> 08:42.533
- So four surgeons
did 14 nasal surgeries on you.

08:42.567 --> 08:45.667
And you're hoping
that the 15th surgery...

08:45.700 --> 08:47.000
- Is the winner.

08:47.033 --> 08:48.533
- I think you win the record...

08:48.567 --> 08:50.533
- The record for the most
nasal surgeries we've heard.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.500
- It's embarrassing.

08:51.567 --> 08:52.734
It's not something I'm proud of.

08:54.133 --> 08:54.700
I feel like, when somebody
doesn't really know me,

08:54.767 --> 08:56.533
they might judge me on that

08:56.567 --> 08:58.400
instead of who I really am.

08:58.433 --> 08:59.734
- I have to tell you,
I'm scared.

08:59.767 --> 09:01.233
There's a lot of red flags,
and I'm scared.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.033
- I've never seen him scared.

09:03.066 --> 09:04.166
- Then I'm scared too.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.133
- Let's go straight
to the exam room.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.700
- My breasts were about 200
pounds, I kid you not.

09:08.734 --> 09:11.066
It was like literally taking
a needle to a balloon,

09:11.100 --> 09:13.200
and they were just like...
[exhales]

09:13.233 --> 09:14.734
- People are not usually
that open

09:14.767 --> 09:17.734
for seeing
such a strange being.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.033
They can just stare at you
like, "Ahh..."

09:25.700 --> 09:27.533
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

09:29.066 --> 09:30.533
- Does that hurt right there?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.700
- I can't say hurt,
but it feels sensitive.

09:32.734 --> 09:35.033
- I mean, your tip
really isn't that big.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.767
It's collapsed and pinched,
but there's just no cartilage.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.000
When I examine a nose
with my hands,

09:40.066 --> 09:41.734
I want to feel
every little irregularity.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.033
I want to check
the nasal bones,

09:43.100 --> 09:44.033
the tip, the skin.

09:44.100 --> 09:44.667
I want to feel how thick it is,

09:45.500 --> 09:46.734
how much scar tissue is there.

09:46.767 --> 09:50.467
I got to do many, many things
which is tactile with my hands.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.700
I want to add an implant
of your own tissue

09:52.767 --> 09:54.734
to the nasal bridge
right here,

09:54.767 --> 09:56.033
give you a little bit more
of a narrow appearance.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.200
- Mm-hmm.

09:57.233 --> 09:59.033
- So your tip has
absolutely no support.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.600
Most of that cartilage
has been removed.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.467
You already have a wide nose.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.734
So I'm gonna have
to use cartilage

10:03.767 --> 10:05.600
to open up your nostrils,

10:05.633 --> 10:07.000
but at the same point,

10:07.066 --> 10:08.700
I got to try
to make this part here

10:08.767 --> 10:09.700
a little bit smaller.

10:09.767 --> 10:10.700
- That would be good.

10:10.767 --> 10:11.433
- The other thing,
there's a chance

10:11.500 --> 10:12.467
that your skin of your nose

10:13.400 --> 10:16.467
could turn black and die
on your 15th surgery.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.133
- Then what do you do
if that happens?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.600
- We would have to take
the forehead,

10:19.633 --> 10:21.533
swing it down,
and reconstruct your whole tip.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.166
That's about four to five
surgeries more.

10:23.233 --> 10:24.767
- Oh, my goodness.
- If that happened.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
- I'm not trying
to scare Stacie,

10:26.667 --> 10:27.633
but the truth is,

10:28.667 --> 10:30.200
the more surgeries you do,
there are higher risks.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.200
And it may scare
some patients away,

10:32.266 --> 10:34.233
but we'd rather
tell every patient,

10:34.266 --> 10:35.767
"This is what
could happen to you."

10:36.000 --> 10:37.567
Then, if they decide
to go through with it,

10:37.633 --> 10:39.166
we can actually proceed
through it.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.500
- One thing that's important
to understand

10:41.533 --> 10:43.100
is that this is a full

10:43.133 --> 10:46.567
trying to put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

10:46.633 --> 10:50.500
The only difference is,
Humpty Dumpty is your surgeon.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.166
- That was like another
horrible insult, as usual.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.500
- I wish there was
a prettier way to say it,

10:55.533 --> 10:58.734
but it is a Humpty Dumpty nose,
so it's okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.633
I've been called much worse.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.633
I'd pick Humpty Dumpty
over an Avatar.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.533
I've spent
almost all of my life

11:04.567 --> 11:06.233
not liking the way
I looked physically.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.767
I would love to have
the next half of my life

11:09.033 --> 11:10.233
have a nose I like.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.734
And I feel confident
that you can help me.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
- Despite the risks, you want
to go through with this?

11:16.033 --> 11:17.500
- I do.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.767
I don't want to look
like a blue monster.

11:19.033 --> 11:20.066
I want to go for it.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.633
I guess I'm a gambler now.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.233
- Great meeting you guys.
- Great to meet you.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.600
- Thank you.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.533
- I'm Leslie, and I have breasts

11:29.567 --> 11:32.000
who do not like to stay
in their assigned seats.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.533
My breasts are leading me
in different directions.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.133
I was kind of a jock
growing up.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.233
I was tall.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.467
I was wide.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.266
I played volleyball,
martial arts, track, swimming.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.667
When I went
through my pregnancies,

11:44.700 --> 11:47.533
I gained 125 pounds total.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.300
My heaviest I've ever been
was 285 pounds.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.266
My breasts were probably
about 200 pounds of that,

11:53.333 --> 11:54.533
I kid you not.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.700
And then, after breastfeeding,

11:56.734 --> 11:59.100
it was like literally
taking a needle to a balloon,

11:59.166 --> 12:01.266
and they were just like...
[exhales]

12:01.333 --> 12:02.767
I got really depressed.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.767
It wasn't normal for me
to go to the gym.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.667
I'd rather come home,
open up a bag of Cheetos,

12:06.734 --> 12:07.767
and watch trash TV.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.667
I had my fiancé Anthony
trying to tell me,

12:10.734 --> 12:13.166
"You only feel
how you make yourself feel."

12:13.200 --> 12:15.166
It took a year for me
to really get into a habit,

12:15.200 --> 12:17.033
and I dropped 60 pounds.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.233
At the gym, we were offered

12:19.300 --> 12:21.033
to go to
a bodybuilding competition.

12:21.066 --> 12:23.133
When we go there,
we saw a bunch of women

12:23.200 --> 12:25.300
in these beautiful bikinis,

12:25.333 --> 12:27.600
just gorgeous,
phenomenal bodies.

12:27.633 --> 12:30.000
There was literally
a light bulb that went off.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.600
There is no reason
why I can't do that.

12:31.633 --> 12:32.700
But I almost felt
like my breasts

12:33.767 --> 12:34.734
were going to hold me back
from placing,

12:35.767 --> 12:36.734
because it was after
I had my children.

12:38.066 --> 12:38.700
They had already deflated
from breastfeeding.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.400
And I saw that a lot of
the women had breast implants.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.300
During my first consultation,

12:44.367 --> 12:47.400
I showed him photos
of what I really was going for,

12:47.467 --> 12:49.133
exaggerated breast implants.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.000
And he said,
"We can definitely do this."

12:51.066 --> 12:52.633
After I woke up
from my first surgery,

12:52.667 --> 12:54.567
I saw a flat chest.

12:54.633 --> 12:56.600
Things just kept
getting worse and worse.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.533
My right implant actually
started moving out to the right.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.200
I told him,
"You need to fix this."

13:01.233 --> 13:04.734
My second surgery
was a bunch of bull[bleep].

13:04.767 --> 13:06.567
It was an implant up top,

13:06.633 --> 13:09.100
and you could feel
all the breast tissue

13:09.133 --> 13:11.233
just hanging on the bottom
of my surgical bra.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.734
Over the last few things,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.667
things have
progressively gotten worse.

13:14.700 --> 13:15.533
This is regular.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.033
You can kind of see it
right here.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.567
But as soon as I go up...

13:21.633 --> 13:23.767
it completely comes out
to the side right there.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.667
With my bodybuilding
competitions,

13:25.700 --> 13:28.700
there's some muscles
that just cannot be worked out,

13:28.767 --> 13:30.100
because I'm limited
with my implant

13:30.133 --> 13:31.300
being in my armpit.

13:31.367 --> 13:33.734
I don't want to deal
with this anymore.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.734
I don't want to deal with this
until my dying age.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.233
I really, honestly don't.

13:44.667 --> 13:48.166
- I don't consider
this as a costume.

13:48.233 --> 13:49.700
This is my everyday.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.734
But people are not usually
that open

13:52.000 --> 13:54.767
for seeing
such a strange being.

13:55.033 --> 13:58.000
They can just stare at you
like, "Ahh..."

13:58.033 --> 14:00.767
I don't usually hear
opinions from others.

14:01.033 --> 14:04.000
I worked this for myself,
to make me happy.

14:04.033 --> 14:05.600
- Giduta.
- Greetings.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.100
- Luis.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.767
- Luis, Saya.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.400
- I went to Whimsic Alley

14:10.433 --> 14:13.100
to find elves
and fantasy characters,

14:13.166 --> 14:14.100
people like me.

14:15.066 --> 14:16.767
Since a long time,
I wanted to look like an elf.

14:17.033 --> 14:19.400
I started my transformation
five years ago.

14:19.433 --> 14:22.100
It's a two-hour process
to transform into an elf.

14:22.166 --> 14:25.667
Start with skin-bleaching soap
from Malaysia,

14:25.700 --> 14:28.633
then bleach my hair, eyebrows.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.233
To protect my bleached skin,

14:30.300 --> 14:33.233
I have to use
a strong sun block.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.500
I want to have purple eyes.

14:34.567 --> 14:38.133
I wanted to go to India

14:38.200 --> 14:40.400
to have an intra-ocular implant.

14:40.467 --> 14:41.667
- Oh, that would be so cool.

14:41.734 --> 14:42.667
I would love
to have purple eyes.

14:42.734 --> 14:43.700
I settle for contact lenses.

14:43.734 --> 14:46.166
- Now I'm wearing effects ears,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.633
but I want my ears to be cut
to look like an elf, actually.

14:49.700 --> 14:50.667
- I actually think
it's kind of pretty.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.200
- I have a collection
of 12 different elf ears.

14:54.233 --> 14:57.433
These are my favorites,
because they look so long

14:57.467 --> 14:59.166
and so nice.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.300
- I think you're beautiful
and elvish either way.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.400
- Thank you.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.233
- I heard that you are
the messiah of breasts.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.700
- The messiah of breasts.

15:07.734 --> 15:10.266
If Terry is the messiah
of breasts,

15:10.333 --> 15:13.100
does that make me
the Moses of noses?

15:13.166 --> 15:14.433
[laughter]

15:14.500 --> 15:16.000
- I already like my profile.

15:16.066 --> 15:18.700
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.066
- What, no?

15:20.100 --> 15:21.166
- You're not gonna get
a small front

15:21.233 --> 15:22.200
and a small profile.

15:22.233 --> 15:23.734
It's just not gonna happen.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.400
You cannot have your cake
and eat it.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.734
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

15:33.767 --> 15:35.433
- Next patient's name
is Leslie.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.000
Obviously
a fitness enthusiast.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.500
But looks like--

15:38.533 --> 15:40.233
- Is that a double bubble
on the sides?

15:40.266 --> 15:41.767
- A lateral double bubble.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.100
And I don't think
I've actually ever seen

15:44.200 --> 15:46.066
a lateral double bubble before,
so that's very weird.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.400
So why don't we bring
Leslie in

15:47.467 --> 15:48.400
and see what's going on.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.433
- Can you please send in Leslie?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.533
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.000
- Dr. Nassif.
- Leslie.

15:54.066 --> 15:56.500
- Terry Dubrow.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

15:56.533 --> 15:58.000
- Anthony.
- Anthony, how are you?

15:59.266 --> 16:01.333
- I'm hoping Dr. Dubrow can
fill them to maximum capacity.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.166
I want to be able
to be a flotation device.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.233
I want to save lives
with these bad boys.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.367
That's how big we want to go,
I kid you not.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.500
- Are you guys married?

16:10.533 --> 16:11.734
- We're engaged right now.
- Okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.200
- The wedding
is about a year out.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.433
- So how did this start?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.100
- I actually gained
an excess amount of weight

16:16.133 --> 16:18.066
when I had two pregnancies
back-to-back,

16:18.133 --> 16:21.400
and a total weight gain
of 125 pounds or so.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.233
About a year later,
I lost 60 pounds,

16:23.266 --> 16:26.000
and then I saw that my breast
tissue was actually sagging

16:26.033 --> 16:28.033
because of all the weight
that I had lost.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.567
I actually consulted
with a surgeon.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.367
I wanted beach balls, basically,
on my chest.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.567
That's what I was looking for.

16:34.767 --> 16:36.333
I was really adamant
about getting full breasts,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.066
because I had them, you know?

16:38.133 --> 16:40.567
I basically wanted to go back
to what I had

16:40.600 --> 16:42.433
pre-children, pre-weight-loss.

16:42.467 --> 16:44.066
We went into surgery,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.767
and when I woke up,
I was extremely flat.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.000
I was having
implant displacement as well.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.233
And then he says
we can go in there,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.066
sew up the pocket,
and fix it.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.567
So I woke up
from the second surgery.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.233
There was no breast lift done,
so it was even worse.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.367
All the breast tissue
was just hanging down here.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.333
- So the skin envelope drooped

17:00.400 --> 17:02.300
while the implants
were way up here.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.333
We call that a dissociation.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.100
- Great.
- Yeah.

17:06.166 --> 17:09.100
- So I started feeling
this sharp pain.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.033
My implant was all the way
in my armpit.

17:11.066 --> 17:12.533
It ripped all the way
through the pocket.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.533
- Ouch, so have you stopped
lifting weights?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.533
- I can't do push-ups, pull-ups,
chest-related exercise.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.333
Immediately,
it pops out to the side.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.233
The breast pain
that I currently have

17:21.300 --> 17:23.233
runs between
a three and a four.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.066
Should I flex my implant,
it's seriously like a nine.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.533
If the pocket wants to rip
even further,

17:27.600 --> 17:30.467
I can feel that sharp pain
again in my implant.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.600
- What are your goals?

17:31.633 --> 17:33.567
- My goal is to go big
or go home.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.166
And I heard that you are
the messiah of breasts,

17:36.200 --> 17:37.367
and so...

17:37.433 --> 17:39.400
- What, of fake breasts?

17:39.467 --> 17:41.000
The messiah of breasts.

17:41.066 --> 17:42.433
[laughter]

17:42.467 --> 17:45.033
If Terry
is the messiah of breasts,

17:45.066 --> 17:48.000
does that make me
the Moses of noses?

17:48.066 --> 17:49.133
- All right,
so let's go have a look.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.133
- Okay, great.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.333
- Leslie has been wronged.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.133
She came in with a plan
and knows what she wants.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.433
Now it's up to us to see whether
that's a possibility or not.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.033
So let's see what's
going on anatomically.

18:00.066 --> 18:01.100
Can we just--can we do this?

18:01.133 --> 18:02.066
- Oh, yeah.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.100
This one goes out this way.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.166
This one goes up.

18:04.233 --> 18:07.033
So it's gonna get stuck,
hold on.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.433
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

18:09.500 --> 18:10.433
- It sits there like that.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.433
That's what I'm talking about.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.633
- That is weird.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.166
- So your muscle
is holding it up.

18:14.233 --> 18:15.300
- Mm-hmm.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.166
- I've never seen an implant
do that before,

18:18.066 --> 18:20.166
slide in and out
of a pocket like that.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.667
Yeah, you learn something new
every day.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.133
- And then,
when I push it down...

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
- Oh, I know what he did.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.100
So he probably closed
the pocket off

18:26.133 --> 18:27.667
using some of the muscle
up there,

18:27.734 --> 18:32.100
and the muscle now has attached
to the overlying breast tissue.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.100
- Yeah.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.166
- That's a tricky...

18:34.233 --> 18:34.767
- And then, this one...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.567
- Let me see that one;
do that.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.033
Oh, my gosh.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.300
By the way,
the irony of the tattoo

18:41.367 --> 18:45.467
directly overlying the most
difficult abnormality there is.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.066
- "Imperfection is beauty."

18:47.133 --> 18:48.066
- "Imperfection is beauty."

18:49.033 --> 18:51.367
And if imperfection is beauty,
that is beautiful,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.367
because that is really tricky.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.433
I've seen plenty
of dissociated breast implants.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.200
However, I've never seen
someone like Leslie

18:59.266 --> 19:02.533
that's had such a significant
animation deformity.

19:02.567 --> 19:06.300
I just hope I can repair
the pocket adequately enough

19:06.367 --> 19:09.166
to prevent this from happening
again in the future.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.633
You have a naturally
very wide breast.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.233
When we do a lift
and tighten the envelope,

19:14.266 --> 19:17.100
you can't tighten the width.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.266
I mean, you're probably gonna
smile a little bit about this.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.667
You do actually need
a big-ish breast implant.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.567
- There you go.
- There you go, right?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.567
- To be honest,
I really don't care,

19:26.600 --> 19:27.767
the size of Leslie's breasts.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.433
But to see Leslie's face
light up, it means a lot.

19:30.467 --> 19:31.633
- Do you want
to do this surgery?

19:31.700 --> 19:32.633
- I do.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.467
I'm full on board.

19:34.533 --> 19:37.200
I cannot wait to be able
to flaunt these bad boys

19:37.266 --> 19:39.100
at my bachelorette party.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.600
I just need my breasts
to be fixed.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.100
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.333
- Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.734
- Pleasure meeting you guys,
thank you.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.633
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.233
- I know you had
some concerns.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.533
So do you want to go over
a few things first?

19:52.567 --> 19:53.633
- I'd like to, yes.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.166
- You have no support
in the middle part of your nose.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.533
So we have these things
called spreader grafts.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.033
We're gonna do that
with the hope

19:59.066 --> 20:00.633
of opening up your airway.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.700
However, it makes it wider.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.734
To counterbalance that width,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.400
we're gonna put something called
the septal extension graft

20:07.467 --> 20:10.533
to set your tip projection
and make your tip smaller.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.667
- I already like my profile.

20:11.734 --> 20:15.200
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.533
You're not gonna get a small
front and a small profile.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.433
It's just not gonna happen.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.500
You cannot have your cake
and eat it.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.500
- I want that.

20:21.567 --> 20:22.667
I want my cake and eat it.

20:22.734 --> 20:24.400
- This is your 15th surgery.

20:24.467 --> 20:25.633
There's no sweetness with this.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.333
So we got to pick one
or the other.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.734
- So I prefer the more
drastic change in my front

20:30.767 --> 20:33.133
and sacrifice my profile.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.233
- All right.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.433
For Stacie's surgery,

20:36.600 --> 20:37.734
we'll begin by harvesting
rib and fascia material

20:39.066 --> 20:39.533
then open up her nose
and straighten the septum

20:40.500 --> 20:40.667
before fracturing
the nasal bones

20:41.767 --> 20:43.333
and adding a PDS plate
and spreader grafts.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.133
Next, we will
reconstruct her tip.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.367
Finally, we will use
a dice cartilage fascia graft

20:47.433 --> 20:48.734
to build up her dorsum,

20:50.233 --> 20:52.300
hopefully giving Stacie a nose
that is structurally stable.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.600
It's almost like going into
a little box of Cracker Jacks.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.667
I got to see what
the surprise is gonna be.

20:56.734 --> 20:59.467
And then just set in through
the scar tissue right now.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.433
So her nostril
feels like a brick.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:02.734 --> 21:04.300
- So we got to see
what's going on there.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.633
And then the skin is stuck.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.333
[grunts]

21:08.367 --> 21:11.467
I can barely take
my very sharp scissors

21:11.500 --> 21:12.667
and cut through her scar.

21:12.734 --> 21:14.000
I mean, that right there
just tells me

21:14.066 --> 21:16.400
that this is gonna be a doozy.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.767
Okay, the skin's been lifted
off the nose.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.667
So far, I'm seeing nothing.

21:19.734 --> 21:20.700
Damn it.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.600
Where the hell is the septum?

21:22.633 --> 21:24.166
Oh, my god.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.433
There's nothing left
inside this nose.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.333
No septal cartilage present,
zero.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.200
The septum helps
support the nose,

21:31.266 --> 21:33.333
keeps both sides divided.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.266
So now I have
to reconstruct that.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.266
Go.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.266
[tapping]

21:37.300 --> 21:38.467
Go.

21:38.533 --> 21:40.700
I want to hear every little bang
of this bone

21:40.767 --> 21:43.200
to make sure we are okay.

21:43.266 --> 21:46.000
The scary part about fracturing
Stacie's nasal bones

21:46.033 --> 21:48.600
is that the bones have already
been fractured multiple times.

21:48.667 --> 21:49.700
And what's important here

21:49.767 --> 21:52.233
is that we don't cause
any collapse

21:52.266 --> 21:56.333
or any destruction of the normal
nasal anatomy in this area.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.033
And there it goes.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.767
So that was the bump
that was on the left.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.633
Now we at least
have symmetry.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.467
Oof, okay,
let's start the reconstruction.

22:04.533 --> 22:05.333
PS plate.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.667
Then you have
an intranasal spine.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.133
I'm using
every graft that I know

22:10.367 --> 22:11.767
to reconstruct Stacie's nose
essentially from scratch.

22:12.033 --> 22:13.633
This is not something
that we do every day.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.266
Getting some projection.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.367
- Ooh, I like that.

22:16.433 --> 22:17.367
- Well, I got to say,

22:17.433 --> 22:19.000
we definitely got a projection.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.633
We got her frontal appearance

22:20.700 --> 22:22.333
of her nose
looking a lot thinner.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.033
After having 15 rhinoplasties,

22:24.066 --> 22:26.300
every doctor just kept
taking stuff away.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.700
This is why I had to add every
cartilage graft that I know.

22:29.734 --> 22:31.500
I hope this
is gonna be Stacie's

22:31.567 --> 22:33.000
15th and final surgery.

22:33.033 --> 22:34.000
We just have to see.

22:34.033 --> 22:35.066
Who knows?

22:37.700 --> 22:39.233
- Look at the size
of this needle.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.233
- [groaning]

22:40.300 --> 22:43.633
I can't even look anymore.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.233
I'm getting light-headed.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.367
- Are you really?

22:46.433 --> 22:47.500
You're getting light-headed?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.367
You sissy.

22:49.433 --> 22:53.667
- I have still to go to India
to change my eye color again.

22:53.734 --> 22:54.767
- Again?

22:55.033 --> 22:56.533
We've had some weird patients,

22:56.600 --> 23:00.100
but this guy
is out of this world.

23:05.734 --> 23:09.000
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

23:09.066 --> 23:10.033
- Hello.

23:10.066 --> 23:12.166
He's here, my man.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.166
- Are you kidding me?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.166
- Let me take some gloves off.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.166
How are you?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.567
Nice to see you.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.433
- My anesthesiologist,
Dr. Mest,

23:18.467 --> 23:21.066
is one of the premier
facial filler injectors

23:21.100 --> 23:22.166
in the world.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.166
Okay, so, me first?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.166
- Yes.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.667
- As we age,

23:25.734 --> 23:27.700
the collagen production
in our face slows.

23:27.734 --> 23:29.734
Our face deflates,
and it drops.

23:29.767 --> 23:32.066
And that's
the first physical sign

23:32.100 --> 23:33.700
of aging in the face.

23:33.734 --> 23:36.066
- If we put something too heavy
back through here,

23:36.100 --> 23:39.200
then it's going to just hang.

23:39.233 --> 23:41.600
- Oh, god, I don't--
oh, Jesus.

23:41.633 --> 23:44.567
- This is just
a little numbing medicine.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.567
- Hello.

23:45.633 --> 23:46.633
[laughter]

23:46.667 --> 23:48.033
- It burns a little bit,
doesn't it?

23:48.100 --> 23:50.734
- What's this do?
- This is Botox.

23:50.767 --> 23:52.467
- This is so painful.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.633
You're gonna love it.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.033
Look at this;
look how deep he goes.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.667
That'll wake you up
in the morning.

23:56.734 --> 23:57.767
Isn't this amazing?

23:58.000 --> 23:58.767
- I got to tell you,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.467
I'm just kind of
amazed at you.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.600
You know,
you really are a freak.

24:02.633 --> 24:04.100
I'm gonna need someone
to hold my hand.

24:04.133 --> 24:06.200
I do have to say,
I'm H.M.P. for that.

24:06.233 --> 24:07.367
- You're what?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.500
- High-maintenance Paul.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.600
- Yeah, big shock.

24:10.633 --> 24:13.200
Paul, you're H.M.P.
for everything.

24:13.233 --> 24:14.467
- Isn't that cool?

24:14.500 --> 24:15.734
- Now we're gonna do
a little sculpter.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.233
- Look at the size
of this needle.

24:17.266 --> 24:20.200
If you thought that hurt,
check this out.

24:20.266 --> 24:21.633
Yeah.

24:21.667 --> 24:22.667
I don't know
what I like better,

24:23.667 --> 24:27.066
getting injected with fillers
or torturing Paul.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.533
- [groans]

24:28.567 --> 24:31.100
I'm getting nauseated.

24:31.133 --> 24:32.200
- Oh, that's a neat sound.

24:32.266 --> 24:33.500
Oh, yeah.

24:33.533 --> 24:34.633
You know what I'm excited about?

24:34.667 --> 24:37.734
There's still another side
to do.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.200
- I'm getting light-headed.

24:39.266 --> 24:40.467
- Are you really?

24:40.533 --> 24:41.633
You're getting light-headed?

24:41.667 --> 24:43.233
You sissy.

24:43.266 --> 24:44.667
- I don't know
why I'm getting squeamish.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.100
I think it's just me
watching Terry's face.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.233
I don't think I feel good.

24:48.266 --> 24:49.633
- Are you serious?

24:49.667 --> 24:51.200
You better step out.

24:51.266 --> 24:52.633
Oh, my god.

24:52.667 --> 24:54.100
See, I told you he wouldn't
be able to handle it.

24:54.133 --> 24:56.633
- I have never had a patient
not do it.

24:56.667 --> 24:57.667
What a wuss.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.166
[laughter]

25:03.166 --> 25:05.533
- I have a patient for you,
name of Luis.

25:05.567 --> 25:07.033
Came to us from Argentina.

25:07.066 --> 25:07.633
- Argentina?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.000
- Let's take a look.
- Show me.

25:09.033 --> 25:10.533
- He's a handsome guy.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.033
Oh.

25:12.066 --> 25:13.033
Now he looks like an alien.

25:13.066 --> 25:14.533
Let's figure out
what he wants.

25:14.567 --> 25:16.033
- Can you please send in Luis?

25:16.066 --> 25:17.567
[atmospheric music]

25:17.600 --> 25:18.567
[chuckling]

25:18.600 --> 25:20.533
Oh, he's got the ears going.

25:20.567 --> 25:21.633
Sporting those ears.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.700
Luis, Dr. Nassif.

25:22.734 --> 25:24.000
- Nice to meet you,
Dr. Nassif.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.667
- Hi, Luis, Terry Dubrow.

25:25.700 --> 25:26.667
- Nice to meet you.

25:26.700 --> 25:27.700
- What is that, a crystal ball?

25:27.734 --> 25:28.700
- This is a gift.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.033
It is a crystal ball,

25:30.066 --> 25:31.133
but if you move it this way,

25:31.166 --> 25:32.667
it can show you your dreams.

25:32.700 --> 25:33.667
- Show us our dreams?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.266
Ooh.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.133
- The crystal ball
is unbreakable,

25:37.166 --> 25:40.000
because that's the way
how dreams are supposed to be:

25:40.066 --> 25:41.266
unbreakable.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.300
My dream is to become
a fantasy character.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.567
And I will do anything
to achieve that dream.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.467
- So do you want to look
like an alien,

25:48.500 --> 25:49.734
or do you have elf ears?

25:49.767 --> 25:52.000
What are we trying
to achieve here?

25:52.066 --> 25:53.000
- Both.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.033
There are different elves,

25:54.066 --> 25:56.200
not only that
of the fairy tales.

25:56.233 --> 25:58.000
There are also space elves.

25:58.066 --> 25:59.467
- Space elves?
- Yeah.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.600
- They are a species of aliens
that look humanoid,

26:03.633 --> 26:07.133
but faces with cat shape.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.000
- We've had some weird patients,

26:09.066 --> 26:12.533
but this guy
is out of this world.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.033
So your fantasy is to be
a complete, full elf.

26:16.066 --> 26:18.700
- I will not stop
until I reach that goal.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.166
- I think you've arrived.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.633
I think you've reached
that goal.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.600
- Not yet.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.700
I feel like I am
in the middle of my way.

26:25.767 --> 26:26.700
- Really?

26:26.767 --> 26:28.767
- I have still to go to India

26:29.000 --> 26:30.734
to change my eye color again.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.200
- Again?
- Again.

26:32.233 --> 26:33.567
- You've done it before?

26:33.633 --> 26:34.767
- Five times.

26:35.000 --> 26:35.767
- What did they do?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.166
- Laser color change.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.233
- So you've had
five laser procedures

26:39.266 --> 26:41.033
on the iris of your eyes.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.233
Did you lose any sight

26:42.266 --> 26:45.033
with those laser
eye color change procedures?

26:45.100 --> 26:48.567
- Well, I lose my sight,
but just a few days.

26:48.633 --> 26:49.633
- That's scary.
- Yeah.

26:50.667 --> 26:51.734
- The problem with any surgery
of the eye

26:51.767 --> 26:53.066
is that you basically sign up

26:54.200 --> 26:55.567
for the possibility
of scar tissue formation,

26:55.633 --> 26:58.033
severe infection,
early cataracts,

26:58.100 --> 27:01.066
and, of course,
full-blown blindness.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.000
You are willing
to risk blindness

27:03.033 --> 27:04.233
to have your eye color changed?

27:04.266 --> 27:05.734
- Yes, no risk, no gain.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.066
- What else are you considering
having done?

27:08.133 --> 27:10.133
- Well, I have to cut my ears
to be pointy like an elf.

27:10.166 --> 27:12.100
- And you found a doctor
to do that?

27:12.133 --> 27:13.567
- Yes.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.767
- I have seen people
get their ears manipulated

27:17.000 --> 27:18.767
the way Luis is talking about.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.767
It's done in sort of
these back alley

27:21.000 --> 27:22.633
body modification clinics.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.734
But they can have
a lot of complications.

27:25.000 --> 27:25.734
I have actually fixed

27:26.700 --> 27:27.767
a significant number
of those complications.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.633
And it can be really dangerous.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.000
- I want to have
a lifting of my whole face

27:32.033 --> 27:33.200
to look like this.

27:33.266 --> 27:34.734
- Whoa.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
- It is strange,
but I like it.

27:37.033 --> 27:38.000
- You like that strange look,
huh?

27:38.033 --> 27:39.000
- Yeah.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.333
It's just something that,

27:40.400 --> 27:43.266
it needs to be good for me,
not for others.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.100
- You've come to us
for specific reasons.

27:45.166 --> 27:46.600
- Well, I want to fix my nose,

27:46.667 --> 27:48.233
and I want to fix my jaw line.

27:48.300 --> 27:53.500
If you see, the point of my nose
is pointing that way.

27:53.567 --> 27:55.000
I want just to move it
a little bit

27:55.033 --> 27:57.166
and try to make it smaller.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.266
- Let me ask you a question.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.633
What mythical creature

27:59.700 --> 28:01.300
would you suggest
he converted to,

28:01.333 --> 28:03.000
just based on the way he looks?

28:03.033 --> 28:04.000
- A goblin.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.166
- A goblin?
- Yeah.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.166
- That's scary.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.166
What does a goblin look like?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.633
Don't talk.

28:08.700 --> 28:11.400
- One of my inspirations
is Jareth from "Labyrinth,"

28:11.433 --> 28:12.667
the Goblin King.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.033
It was David Bowie.

28:14.066 --> 28:15.667
- All right,
so like David Bowie.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.000
- Yeah.

28:17.033 --> 28:17.700
- You don't look
like David Bowie.

28:17.734 --> 28:18.700
Trust me.

28:18.734 --> 28:19.667
- Don't hear it.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.700
You can't be whatever you want.

28:20.734 --> 28:22.033
- Thank you.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.166
- I have a goblin with me
right now,

28:23.200 --> 28:24.667
in my backpack.

28:24.700 --> 28:25.700
- Can you bring the goblin
into the exam room?

28:26.734 --> 28:28.033
Because I want to see
what a goblin looks like.

28:28.066 --> 28:30.033
- Sure.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.033
- Tough case.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.266
Really, really tough.

28:32.333 --> 28:36.066
Not for beginners,
that's for sure.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.533
- Give us a big, wide smile,
just like this.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.633
Big smile.

28:39.734 --> 28:44.033
The resemblance between
this goblin and Paul is uncanny,

28:44.066 --> 28:46.300
except Paul's a little shorter.

28:52.734 --> 28:55.000
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
- Look at that.

29:00.633 --> 29:01.600
So this is a goblin.

29:01.633 --> 29:03.033
- That's a goblin.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.333
In Argentina, the people believe
that they live in the forest.

29:06.367 --> 29:10.367
Merlin brings good luck to me,
protects me from mean people.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.033
He's such a good friend to me.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.100
- By the way,
I completely agree with you.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.767
Give is a big, wide smile,
just like this.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.700
Big smile.

29:19.767 --> 29:24.166
The resemblance between
this goblin and Paul is uncanny,

29:24.233 --> 29:27.367
except Paul's a little shorter.

29:27.400 --> 29:31.633
- You can put your head back
just a little bit.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.066
Your breathing is bad.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.667
- Yeah, my breathing is bad,

29:34.734 --> 29:36.767
compared it how it was before.

29:37.000 --> 29:37.700
- Do these come off?

29:37.767 --> 29:38.633
- Yeah.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.000
- Can we see what your eyes
look like now?

29:41.066 --> 29:45.000
- Those are my natural
eye color.

29:45.066 --> 29:47.433
With good light,
they look gray.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.133
They were brown when I was born.

29:50.166 --> 29:54.767
- Right now, making your tip
point more towards the midline

29:55.000 --> 29:57.400
and the sides
of your nose smaller,

29:57.433 --> 29:59.066
really what we're talking
about doing

29:59.133 --> 30:00.667
is deforming your nose.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.066
When you go back home,

30:02.133 --> 30:04.333
I want you to walk around
clipped like this.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.767
Okay, now, do you see
yourself breathing

30:06.000 --> 30:06.767
all day long like this?

30:07.767 --> 30:09.300
Will you have the same energy
to do what you want

30:09.367 --> 30:11.066
as a mythical creature?

30:11.133 --> 30:11.633
- It could be difficult.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.333
- You look
like you're suffering.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.667
- So do you think--all right.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.767
So how'd you like that?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.066
- I don't like it.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.767
I have mixed feelings.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.033
I think that they tried
to scare me.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.266
At the same time,

30:23.300 --> 30:26.066
I think I can live
without breathing.

30:26.133 --> 30:28.233
- So do you want to do that
to your nose?

30:28.266 --> 30:30.000
- I will think it.

30:30.033 --> 30:31.700
- Really, nothing that he wants
to do is safe,

30:31.734 --> 30:33.734
and our job
as medical professionals

30:34.000 --> 30:35.200
is to help him realize that.

30:35.266 --> 30:36.400
There's something
right there.

30:36.433 --> 30:37.500
- Right, right, wow.

30:37.567 --> 30:39.233
- Yeah, on both sides, look.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.000
- That's on the pupil, though.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.033
- Yeah.

30:42.066 --> 30:44.033
- After five laser procedures,

30:44.066 --> 30:47.133
you have a hole
in the pupil of your eye.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.467
This is an area
you just do not mess with.

30:49.533 --> 30:52.333
If you lose your vision,

30:52.400 --> 30:56.100
your life is irreversibly
changed forever.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.133
- I can live without breathing,

30:58.133 --> 31:01.133
but without my sight,
it would be impossible.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.300
I can't imagine my life
without seeing.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.333
I will stop working.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.667
I will stop studying.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.333
I will stop doing
the things I love.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.300
- It's a message
from the goblin himself.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.400
Do not do these procedures.

31:13.467 --> 31:16.033
- Well, I will take
the message.

31:16.066 --> 31:17.400
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Sure.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.433
- Hi.
- Hi, Leslie.

31:22.467 --> 31:24.767
- I'm just checking in
for surgery with Dr. Dubrow.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.133
- Okay, great.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.033
Go ahead and sign in, and we'll
get you taken right back.

31:28.066 --> 31:29.033
- Great, thank you.

31:29.066 --> 31:30.033
Today is my surgery.

31:30.066 --> 31:31.400
I've had this twice before,

31:31.467 --> 31:32.567
so I thought I would be
a little bit more relaxed.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.200
But going into this, I feel like
this is the game-changer,

31:35.233 --> 31:37.767
so my anxiety is a little bit
more through the roof.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.767
- So we've brought
these implants.

31:40.033 --> 31:41.200
Put this on.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.233
Okay, legs to the side.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.734
Okay, so, currently,
you have 475 cc there.

31:46.767 --> 31:49.300
If we put in 325s
on top of that,

31:49.333 --> 31:50.533
that's 800.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.567
That's the maximum there is.

31:52.567 --> 31:54.033
And I don't want to go bigger
than 800 anyway,

31:54.066 --> 31:55.266
even if we were to go to saline,

31:55.333 --> 31:56.533
which I don't want
to use either.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.000
- I'm level-headed
to know that if we can't,

31:59.066 --> 32:00.367
then it's totally okay.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.567
- Okay, so why don't you
go ahead

32:01.633 --> 32:03.300
and put this
on your right side?

32:03.367 --> 32:04.300
Hold this.

32:04.367 --> 32:05.533
Is that gonna be too big?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.233
- No, I don't think so.

32:07.266 --> 32:10.367
- It's very rare that I--
that we--put in 800s,

32:10.400 --> 32:14.100
because, you know, that's
what gets girls in trouble.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.000
If I think that there's
still too much tension,

32:16.066 --> 32:17.767
then we might have to go
a little smaller, okay?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.100
But we'll see.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.200
- Dr. Dubrow understands
exactly what I'm looking for,

32:21.233 --> 32:23.100
and I truly, honestly
believe that.

32:23.133 --> 32:25.533
And so the anticipation
for the final result

32:25.600 --> 32:27.033
is just extremely high.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.233
- The bigger you go,
the greater the chance

32:29.266 --> 32:31.033
that you will
have complications

32:31.100 --> 32:34.133
the type of which Leslie
is now currently suffering.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.033
But she absolutely
has to have a large implant

32:38.100 --> 32:40.533
to satisfy the large width
of her breasts.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.734
Today, for Leslie's surgery,

32:43.100 --> 32:44.266
I'll begin by making incisions
around the areola.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.333
On the right side,

32:46.367 --> 32:47.400
I'll create a flap
of capsular tissue

32:47.433 --> 32:49.066
for use in
the breast pocket repair.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.066
Then I'll remove
the old implant,

32:51.133 --> 32:52.133
rotate the tissue down,

32:53.166 --> 32:54.200
and sew it to the back
of the chest wall.

32:55.333 --> 32:56.633
After that, I'll insert
a new, larger implant.

32:56.667 --> 32:59.300
On the left side,
I'll remove the old implant,

32:59.367 --> 33:01.367
release the pectoralis major
muscle,

33:01.400 --> 33:04.200
and insert a new implant
before closing up.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.033
All right,
so let's start by seeing

33:06.100 --> 33:08.233
what's going on, on the inside.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.500
[suction noise]

33:10.533 --> 33:14.066
Wow, look how thick
this muscle is.

33:14.133 --> 33:15.066
Oh, she's a bodybuilder.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.600
When a person has
a thick muscle,

33:17.667 --> 33:19.300
it is very useful

33:19.333 --> 33:21.467
when you have
to re-create a pocket

33:21.533 --> 33:24.166
and reinforce it
so it doesn't break down.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.033
Okay, so here's her implant.

33:26.066 --> 33:29.667
So I'm sewing down the new wall
made out of her own tissue,

33:29.700 --> 33:31.500
down to the back of her chest.

33:31.567 --> 33:35.100
That can block off the side
of the pocket,

33:35.166 --> 33:37.233
preventing the implant
from falling in the armpit.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.100
This is sort of
like starting over

33:39.166 --> 33:40.567
with Leslie's breast surgery.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.066
New pocket, new implant,
new everything.

33:43.133 --> 33:44.333
We've got the pocket made.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.200
We're gonna go ahead
and put in a 650 cc implant,

33:47.266 --> 33:50.033
which is bigger
than her old implant.

33:50.066 --> 33:51.233
That's plenty big.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.300
They may not be as large
as she had hoped for,

33:54.333 --> 33:56.166
but because they're
in a smaller pocket,

33:56.200 --> 33:58.467
they'll give her exactly
the cosmetic result

33:58.533 --> 33:59.667
that she really wants.

34:01.066 --> 34:03.166
I mean, the smaller I can go
and give her the look she wants,

34:03.200 --> 34:05.333
the more stable
this result will be.

34:05.367 --> 34:07.066
Okay, can we sit
this one up?

34:07.100 --> 34:08.567
Let me see.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.233
The only irregularity now is,
I got loose skin down here,

34:12.300 --> 34:16.066
which is all from
her weight loss, obviously.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.166
The implant looks great,
so I'm going with it.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.066
Now I'm going to move on
to the breast lift operation

34:21.100 --> 34:23.266
she should have gotten
the first time around.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.166
Okay, I've got this right breast
looking actually pretty good.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.400
All right, let's go
to the other side.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.133
Wow, look at that.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.533
They put the implant
completely under the muscle,

34:31.600 --> 34:33.500
but the muscle wasn't released.

34:33.567 --> 34:36.133
Every time she flexed it,
it just formed a shelf

34:36.200 --> 34:38.467
that held up the implant.

34:38.500 --> 34:42.467
I'm basically
dis-inserting the muscle

34:42.500 --> 34:45.233
the way it should have been done
at the original operation.

34:45.266 --> 34:47.367
This case required
a lot of detective work.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.533
I actually had to do
a lot of work

34:49.600 --> 34:52.667
that should have been done
properly the first time.

34:52.734 --> 34:54.100
Okay, that's good.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.333
That's really good.

34:55.367 --> 34:58.200
Tough case,
really, really tough.

34:58.233 --> 35:00.300
Not for beginners,
that's for sure.

35:00.367 --> 35:01.667
I'm happy with the result.

35:01.734 --> 35:03.567
I just hope Leslie will be too.

35:03.633 --> 35:06.433
Okay, let's close her up.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.667
Awesome.

35:08.734 --> 35:11.367
- This is gonna be, for me,
the moment of truth.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.333
So you remember
how wide your nose was?

35:13.367 --> 35:15.266
- I remember.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.500
[gasps]

35:21.700 --> 35:24.100
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

35:27.633 --> 35:30.233
- Hi.
- Good morning, young Stacie.

35:30.266 --> 35:31.200
- Nice to see you.

35:31.266 --> 35:32.333
- You know Dr. Irvine.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.333
- Hi, Dr. Irvine.
- Nice to see you.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.633
- So how you doing?
- I'm great.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.100
- A week after surgery,
I feel really good.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.633
I'm hoping Dr. Nassif
will tell me

35:39.667 --> 35:42.233
that my surgery
was beyond successful

35:42.266 --> 35:44.533
and that I am doing
a great job in healing.

35:44.567 --> 35:46.633
- All right,
let's work on your cast.

35:46.667 --> 35:50.233
This is gonna be, for me,
the moment of truth also here.

35:50.266 --> 35:52.233
So you remember
how wide your nose was?

35:52.266 --> 35:53.734
- I remember.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.633
Time?

35:55.667 --> 35:57.133
[gasps]

35:57.166 --> 35:59.100
Oh, my god.

36:00.734 --> 36:02.200
Oh, my god.

36:02.266 --> 36:03.200
- And it's swollen.

36:03.266 --> 36:04.266
- I can't believe it's me.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.266
I have not liked
the way my face looks

36:07.300 --> 36:09.266
since I was 10 years old.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.166
I'm gonna cry again.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.367
And 35 years
is a long time to live,

36:14.433 --> 36:17.133
looking in the mirror
and not liking your face.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.300
- We're not
out of the woods yet.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.533
We have some little issues
going on.

36:19.567 --> 36:20.500
- Okay.

36:20.567 --> 36:21.633
- At the end of surgery,

36:21.700 --> 36:23.133
you were getting
a little purple

36:23.166 --> 36:25.166
and discolored
right around the incision line,

36:25.200 --> 36:26.533
because that's the area

36:26.567 --> 36:28.667
where the blood supply
is gonna be the worst.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.467
So that skin right there
did necrose a little bit.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.233
So now what we need to do
is take care of this.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.233
So how you gonna do that?

36:35.166 --> 36:36.633
I want to get you
the hyperbaric oxygen today.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.100
Hyperbaric medicine is something

36:39.166 --> 36:40.567
that is used
in all types of treatments.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.000
I mean, we all know it.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.433
Like you see in the movies
for treating the bends,

36:44.467 --> 36:45.433
especially someone
who's a scuba diver

36:46.400 --> 36:47.667
and they get in that
hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

36:47.734 --> 36:49.367
That's number one.

36:49.433 --> 36:53.700
But two, we use it for any type
of chronic infection

36:53.734 --> 36:55.300
or to increase blood flow.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.533
- We only have 7% oxygen
that's produced in the body

36:57.600 --> 36:59.533
that allows us
to sustain life.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.567
In here, you're gonna get
ten times that,

37:01.600 --> 37:03.700
which will speed up
the healing process.

37:03.734 --> 37:06.667
- After every surgery I've had,
I've went in the chamber.

37:06.734 --> 37:07.700
There's no better treatment

37:08.700 --> 37:11.700
than having 100%
oxygen-filled red blood cells

37:11.734 --> 37:13.700
delivered to the injury.

37:13.734 --> 37:15.533
The red blood cells
for the oxygenation

37:15.600 --> 37:17.567
are what help you heal,
got it?

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
- Awesome, yes, awesome.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.467
- You ready for this?
- I am ready for this.

37:21.500 --> 37:25.166
- I'm being locked
into a coffin-like chamber.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.533
I am excited and nervous.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.567
- Okay, well, have fun.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.333
- Thank you, Dr. Nassif.

37:29.367 --> 37:30.333
I hope it helps.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.734
- I'm sure it's gonna help.

37:38.367 --> 37:40.333
- I feel very free today.

37:40.367 --> 37:43.033
This is the first time
I've felt this way

37:43.100 --> 37:44.567
in a very long time.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.633
From 10 years old,
when I looked in the mirror,

37:46.667 --> 37:48.033
I didn't like what I saw.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.433
- Are you guys so excited to
finally see your mom back here?

37:51.500 --> 37:52.667
- Yeah.
- For sure.

37:54.066 --> 37:55.600
- My husband doesn't usually
come to watch me ride,

37:55.633 --> 37:59.533
so I'm excited
to show him my big smile

37:59.600 --> 38:01.233
as I ride in on the horse.

38:01.266 --> 38:04.200
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.433
- How do I look?

38:05.500 --> 38:06.734
- Fantastic.
- You look so good.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.700
- Oh, my gosh.

38:08.767 --> 38:11.467
Oh, my god, so amazing.

38:11.533 --> 38:12.700
- Before this surgery,

38:14.133 --> 38:15.367
I was told by a doctor
that I look like an Avatar.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.400
I've had four accidents
and 14 surgeries.

38:18.433 --> 38:20.066
But now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,

38:20.133 --> 38:22.533
my nose is not only
structurally stable,

38:22.567 --> 38:23.767
but it looks amazing.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.667
Thank you so much.

38:25.700 --> 38:29.266
I feel so lucky
to have a husband like you

38:29.300 --> 38:30.667
and children and friends.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.066
I feel so blessed.

38:32.133 --> 38:33.667
- Such a blessing.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.467
Nobody's ever gonna tell Stacie
she looks like an Avatar again.

38:36.533 --> 38:37.767
She is gorgeous.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.633
After 30 years,
I think she's finally gotten

38:39.667 --> 38:42.266
that beautiful natural nose
that she's always wanted.

38:42.300 --> 38:46.233
- Dr. Nassif really, really
went above and beyond

38:46.266 --> 38:47.667
anything I could have imagined.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.767
I feel more confident.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.500
I am very worried
about future accidents,

38:53.567 --> 38:55.533
because I am accident-prone.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.533
And I realize that I have
to be careful now,

38:58.567 --> 39:01.767
because I don't want to undo
what Dr. Nassif did.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.000
- Whoo!

39:03.033 --> 39:04.667
[laughter]

39:04.700 --> 39:06.533
- I'm so excited to see her.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.000
- I bet you're excited.

39:08.033 --> 39:11.400
- Yes, this is gonna work out
for me.

39:11.433 --> 39:12.700

39:29.700 --> 39:30.667

39:30.700 --> 39:32.000
Last night was terrible.

39:32.033 --> 39:33.433
I started on my first pain med,

39:33.467 --> 39:34.533
and my body is just not used
to taking that strong

39:35.567 --> 39:37.033
of a pain medication,
so I ended up throwing up.

39:37.066 --> 39:38.033
- Ugh.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.667
- And that was tragedy for me
at its finest.

39:40.734 --> 39:42.667
- Occasionally pain medications

39:42.734 --> 39:45.033
don't work for some people
that work for others.

39:45.066 --> 39:46.700
Now that we've got that
all sorted out,

39:46.734 --> 39:49.433
I'm happy Leslie's feeling
much better.

39:49.467 --> 39:51.700
So what I did was,
I took the implants out,

39:51.734 --> 39:53.333
made you sidewalls,

39:53.367 --> 39:55.300
and put in a 650 initially,

39:55.333 --> 39:57.400
and it was, boom, it popped.

39:57.467 --> 39:59.467
And I never could have put
an 800 in.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.600
Plus, that's too big.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.567
- Okay.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.500
- If, in the future,

40:04.400 --> 40:05.700
once things stretch out
a little bit,

40:05.734 --> 40:06.600
you want to go larger,

40:07.467 --> 40:08.667
you probably actually
could go larger.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.533
You probably could go
up to 800.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.700
But 800 would have been
too dangerous.

40:11.734 --> 40:12.533
- Okay.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.700
- So let's see what's cooking.

40:14.734 --> 40:17.734
- My emotions are unraveling
one layer at a time.

40:17.767 --> 40:20.600
I want to see fullness
in my breasts.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.567
- Whatever it takes,
is what I say.

40:22.633 --> 40:23.567
- Oh, wow.

40:23.633 --> 40:25.033
- They look great.

40:25.100 --> 40:25.667
- Look at that, huh?

40:26.500 --> 40:27.734
- Yeah, that makes
a huge difference.

40:27.767 --> 40:29.467
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.567
- It's just what I wanted
from the beginning,

40:30.633 --> 40:32.033
so I'm overwhelmed.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.200
- You're happy?
- Yeah, definitely.

40:34.367 --> 40:35.333
- It's been a long journey
to get to this point.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.066
So it's an emotional moment
right now.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.700
- Nice, right?

40:38.767 --> 40:40.433
- Yeah, it's like finally
having someone who hears you,

40:40.500 --> 40:42.467
and that's really important
to me.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.066
Thank you very, very much,
very much.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.433
- You're so welcome.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.700
You want to know
how you can really thank me?

40:46.767 --> 40:47.734
- How?
- Heal.

40:47.767 --> 40:49.166
- Yeah, for sure.
- Heal great.

40:49.233 --> 40:50.166
By the way,
you have great spirit.

40:50.233 --> 40:51.567
You'll heal.

40:51.633 --> 40:53.633
Helping the hopeless
find their smile again

40:53.667 --> 40:56.100
is absolutely the best part
of this job.

40:56.133 --> 40:57.500
So you're getting married when?

40:57.533 --> 40:58.734
- March of next year.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.367
- All right,
so it's a little too early

41:00.400 --> 41:02.200
for dress shopping right now.

41:02.266 --> 41:04.100
- Exactly,
but once these babies heal,

41:04.133 --> 41:05.633
oh, my god.

41:05.667 --> 41:07.633
- These are gonna look great
in a wedding dress, right?

41:07.667 --> 41:10.066
- Yeah, I don't even
have to say maybe.

41:10.133 --> 41:11.100
They definitely are.

41:11.133 --> 41:12.367
- All right, see you soon.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.500
- All right.
- Thank you, guys.

41:13.533 --> 41:14.767
- Thank you.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.633
- Oh, god, I'm nervous.

41:20.667 --> 41:22.066
- I'm so excited
to see her.

41:22.133 --> 41:23.200
- Right?

41:23.266 --> 41:24.767
- Today, Leslie and I are having

41:25.000 --> 41:27.734
a joint bachelor
slash bachelorette party.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Really excited to share
the experience with our family.

41:30.033 --> 41:32.100
I expect a whole new
radiance about her.

41:32.133 --> 41:33.133
- Bet you're excited.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.367
- He's wanted this for a while.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.767
- Yes, this is gonna
work out for me.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
- He's like, "Yes!"

41:38.033 --> 41:40.667
- I was nervous
going into the surgery

41:40.700 --> 41:41.734
that there was a potential

41:43.000 --> 41:45.033
that I may not get
exactly what I wanted.

41:45.066 --> 41:46.700
I did not think it was
something that was tangible,

41:46.734 --> 41:48.667
something that I would
be able to grasp

41:48.700 --> 41:50.000
and have for myself.

41:50.033 --> 41:51.667
But what I got blew me away.

41:51.700 --> 41:54.400
And the fact that Dr. Dubrow
gave me perfect breasts

41:54.433 --> 41:55.400
is amazing.

41:55.433 --> 41:58.600
It's absolutely amazing.

41:58.667 --> 42:01.433
- Hello.
- Wow!

42:01.467 --> 42:02.767
- What's up, guys?

42:03.033 --> 42:05.133
- Oh, my god!

42:05.166 --> 42:07.500
- Wow.
- Wow.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.533
- Love?

42:08.567 --> 42:10.000
- Va-va-voom.

42:10.033 --> 42:13.133
- I can't--
it's so amazing!

42:13.166 --> 42:14.633
- Leslie looks
like a brand-new woman.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.000
It's not just the breasts,

42:17.133 --> 42:18.000
but it's everything
that comes along with it,

42:19.000 --> 42:19.433
and it makes me feel good
to see her like that.

42:20.333 --> 42:21.533
- I'm really excited
to get back into the gym

42:21.600 --> 42:24.433
and get it together
for the wedding.

42:24.467 --> 42:25.734
I can't wait to get back in,

42:25.767 --> 42:28.266
and there's no me having
to worry

42:28.333 --> 42:30.700
about my boob being off
to the left

42:30.734 --> 42:32.033
or being off to the right.

42:33.166 --> 42:34.633
I cannot wait
to get back into bodybuilding.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.300
So now that my breasts
are in place

42:36.333 --> 42:38.700
and they can fill out
my swimsuit really well,

42:38.734 --> 42:40.567
I'm extremely excited
to go out there

42:40.600 --> 42:42.033
and be ripped and cut up

42:42.066 --> 42:44.000
and have these huge breasts
in front of me

42:44.066 --> 42:45.433
and just nail it.

42:45.467 --> 42:47.166
His favorite is when
he's spotting me

42:47.200 --> 42:48.667
when I'm doing sit-ups,

42:48.734 --> 42:51.433
because then I'm straight
forward to him.

42:51.467 --> 42:52.600
Before my surgery,

42:53.734 --> 42:54.700
my implants fell
into my armpit on the right

42:55.734 --> 42:57.433
and were trapped
underneath my chin on the left.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.166
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:59.200 --> 43:01.700
I have breasts
that stay in place.

43:01.734 --> 43:03.066
And I'm finally able
to get back to the things

43:03.100 --> 43:04.200
that matter most to me.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.500
Thank you so much, guys.

43:05.533 --> 43:06.734
I really appreciate you
being here.

43:06.767 --> 43:08.467
And to a great night
and a great start.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.033
- We love you guys.
- Love you guys.

43:10.100 --> 43:14.333
- To Leslie and Anthony.
- The bride and groom.

43:14.367 --> 43:16.066
- I was actually born female.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.734
- There's no
supporting tissue.

43:17.767 --> 43:20.100
- A male chest
is the last piece

43:20.133 --> 43:21.734
of being able to feel complete.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.767
- My nose looks
like the state of California.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.066
- You look disappointed.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.066
- I thought it my head
it might be something different.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.734
- Plastic surgery
can give you perfection?

43:28.767 --> 43:29.734
- That's what I thought.

43:29.767 --> 43:31.300
- The answer is never.

43:31.367 --> 43:32.734
- Martina is back.

43:32.767 --> 43:35.033
She's made a few changes.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.066
- Good morning.

43:40.066 --> 43:41.300
- What?
