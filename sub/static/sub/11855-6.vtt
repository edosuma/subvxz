00:10.834 --> 00:13.500
What are everyone's plans
for the weekend?

00:13.583 --> 00:15.250
Ariel?

00:15.333 --> 00:18.667
Um, I'm going to the mall
with Brandi and Tiffany.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.583
And then they're having
dinner at my house.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.917
(Brandi)
'We're going shopping for
an outfit for the dance.'

00:24.000 --> 00:25.458
They're gonna be
like the same

00:25.542 --> 00:26.917
but we each
get a different color.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.417
Mine's gonna be strapless.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.709
(teacher)
'Great.'

00:30.792 --> 00:32.917
Rita, what are you
doing this weekend?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.375
Me and my mom are probably
getting an iguana.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.250
But they're really big
when they're fully matured

00:38.333 --> 00:41.625
so we're maybe
building our own habitat.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.667
That's terrific, Rita.

00:58.709 --> 01:02.625
â™ª Your head is there
to move you around

02:06.917 --> 02:08.291
Caitlin Gaither.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.208
White female, 19.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.333
Park ranger found her
a few hours ago.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.208
(Lilly)
'In the water?'

02:14.291 --> 02:15.709
Yeah. Took us a spell
to get her up.

02:15.792 --> 02:18.333
People know this ain't the
best
place for swimming laps.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.208
Name like "Devil's
Pool
kind of says it all.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.041
Chestnut Hill kids come here
and dive. Local tradition.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.875
The trick is
you gotta jump far

02:25.959 --> 02:27.458
and to the left
to miss the rocks.

02:27.542 --> 02:28.959
That's how rich kids
get a thrill, huh?

02:29.041 --> 02:31.709
Yeah, well, our girl went
straight down to the rocks.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.291
Never got back up.

02:33.375 --> 02:34.250
Drowned?

02:34.333 --> 02:35.458
With a little help.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.500
Bruises go round the back.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.375
They held her head in the water?

02:44.458 --> 02:45.875
Yeah. That's not
the only reason

02:45.959 --> 02:47.583
I dragged you out
in the cold though.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.125
It's alright,
it's our pleasure.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.500
What's with the marks?

02:54.583 --> 02:56.166
Magic marker,
looks like.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.375
(John)
'In 1990'

02:57.458 --> 02:59.834
'a little girl was found
in the water here'

02:59.917 --> 03:02.000
broken neck.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.917
Had the same marks
all over her body.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
And 14 years later to the day
this girl's killed.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.583
Big deal case.
We worked it to death.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.500
But nothing stuck
and it went cold.

03:11.583 --> 03:12.959
Think this is a copycat?

03:13.041 --> 03:15.834
Detail about the marks was
never
released to the press.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.792
So we're looking
at the same doer.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.083
Good chance.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.500
Guy lays low 14 years.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.250
Why come back now?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.583
He got something to say?

04:02.792 --> 04:05.458
(Scotty)
'Can I get that for you?'

04:05.542 --> 04:07.500
No, Scotty.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.959
You sit.

04:10.041 --> 04:14.166
Well, they did their due
diligence first time around.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.208
They have any ideas
on these marks?

04:16.291 --> 04:18.667
Well, at first detectives
wondered were they ritualistic

04:18.750 --> 04:20.250
but they couldn't find
any pattern to them.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.667
They didn't match anything
the FBI had on file.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.500
Seventh grader
at Chestnut
Collegiate.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.125
Pricey prep school.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.875
Yeah, but Rita was
a scholarship kid.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.333
Well, she and her mom were

04:30.417 --> 04:31.959
how the other half
lives in Chestnut Hill.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.834
Mother's an art teacher,
Community College.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.834
Tucks her daughter
in at 10:00 P.M.

04:35.917 --> 04:38.792
Next morning she's
two miles from her house.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.041
Blunt-force trauma
from hitting the rocks.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.583
Could've snuck
out
to meet someone.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.834
Or someone snatched her,
brought her there.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.250
We got any leads on
who killed this new victim?

04:47.333 --> 04:48.750
We do now.

04:48.834 --> 04:52.041
Gil Sherman's bringing in a
guy
caught speeding toward Jersey

04:52.125 --> 04:54.375
with a car full of
Caitlin Gaither's clothes.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.375
(Gil)
'He gave himself up when we
flashed the lights.'

04:58.458 --> 05:00.959
- Confessed?
- For an hour straight.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.417
Now his parents are here,
he doesn't want to see them.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.208
That's them.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.750
Detectives Rush and Valens.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.041
Jason Beaudry.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.667
My wife, Holly.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.083
This is a mistake.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.542
Neil is schizophrenic and he's
very confused right now.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.750
We know this is a bad time,
but I need to ask.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.834
Did you or your son know a
girl
named Rita Baxter?

05:22.667 --> 05:25.500
She was the girl who died
at Devil's Pool years ago.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.417
No, we didn't know her.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.542
Are you trying to pin
something else on him now?

05:29.625 --> 05:31.250
She went to school in your
neck of the woods.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.583
(Holly)
'We remember the story.
It was tragic.'

05:33.667 --> 05:35.583
But that was the only
time
I'd ever heard her
name.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.917
(Jason)
'This is wrong.'

05:37.000 --> 05:39.417
You're taking
advantage
of a sick person.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.875
Oh, what's he on?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.458
Clozaril.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.417
If you bring it in,
we can get that to him.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.625
He might be here a while.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.083
Neil, this is Detective Rush.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.583
She's got some
questions for
you.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.291
Oh, he ain't in a good way.
He's seeing things.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.875
Neil, why did you go
to Devil's Pool yesterday?

05:58.959 --> 06:03.542
I, uh, I-I go every year.
On the 16th of November.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.917
Why that day?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.583
You know a girl
named Rita Baxter?

06:07.667 --> 06:09.625
Everything is the same there.

06:09.709 --> 06:12.375
It's always dead.

06:12.458 --> 06:15.041
So you go there every year.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.792
This year you killed a girl.

06:16.875 --> 06:17.875
Why?

06:17.959 --> 06:21.166
If I...touch things,
they'll die.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.750
(Lilly)
'Did you put the marks
on this girl's body?'

06:23.834 --> 06:26.166
It was my first time.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.542
Did you kill this girl
just like you killed Rita,
Neil?

06:28.625 --> 06:30.125
No! No!

06:30.208 --> 06:32.959
Rita has the same marks
on her body.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.792
No. I killed this girl,
but not Rita.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.625
- Sit down.
- He's got a pace. They do
that.

06:38.709 --> 06:41.125
Why do you go to
Devil's Pool every year

06:41.208 --> 06:43.834
the same day Rita died?

06:43.917 --> 06:46.166
You're going away
anyway, Neil.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.792
- You got nothing to lose.
- No!

06:48.875 --> 06:50.291
I'm sorry.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.333
We give him his
meds,
it'll be easier.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.875
(Will)
'Rita had a thing
for cats, huh?'

06:58.959 --> 07:02.125
Muse of choice
and she was
prolific.

07:02.208 --> 07:05.291
I could paper the walls
in felines in costumes.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.250
I said, "You're 12.
What about boys?"

07:10.875 --> 07:12.000
So..

07:12.083 --> 07:13.959
We came across someone.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.208
Neil Beaudry.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.000
(Nick)
'Big shot,
Chestnut Hill family.'

07:18.083 --> 07:19.208
Father was an importer.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.458
Yeah, I know that name.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.834
Brandi Beaudry.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.500
She was in Rita's year
at Chestnut Collegiate.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.041
That's Neil's kid sister.

07:29.333 --> 07:33.000
- What did the boy do?
- He's a murder suspect.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.750
Girl died at Devil's Pool.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.041
'Had the same
marks on her.'

07:37.125 --> 07:41.041
Rita went to school with his
sister since she was five.

07:41.125 --> 07:44.333
- I'm sure he knew who she was.
- Parents said he didn't.

07:44.417 --> 07:45.667
All those people
weren't around enough

07:45.750 --> 07:47.917
to have any idea
who their kids knew.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.750
And while they were
busy jetting off

07:49.834 --> 07:52.125
spending their bags of money

07:52.208 --> 07:54.625
their daughter
was tormenting Rita.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.583
(Rita)
'She goes into the water'

07:59.667 --> 08:02.375
and with her mind,
she calls the dolphins.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.333
They swim and they
have a friendship

08:04.417 --> 08:06.959
even without,
like, words.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.375
That sounds great.

08:08.458 --> 08:11.208
It's by the same writer
as "A Wrinkle In Time."

08:15.250 --> 08:16.917
I don't feel so well.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.458
All of a
sudden?
What's wrong?

08:18.542 --> 08:21.166
Please, momma,
can we go home?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.166
Hey, there's Ariel.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.542
Mom, we're not
friends anymore.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.542
- Why not?
- She's friends with Brandi
now.

08:26.625 --> 08:30.083
- Brandi doesn't like me.
- Well, then Brandi's an
idiot.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.542
Brandi's mean.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.834
She always says,
"What are you looking at?"

08:33.917 --> 08:37.750
And one time she took my jacket
and said it was from sears

08:37.834 --> 08:40.834
and gave it to the janitor,
but I took it back.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.709
Rita, listen to me

08:43.792 --> 08:45.333
everyone who's ever
been anything

08:45.417 --> 08:48.417
in the history of time
has been a loser in junior
high.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.041
And six years from now
you're gonna be in
college

08:51.125 --> 08:53.583
and you are gonna be
the coolest girl
around.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.625
Because you're smart
and you're different

08:56.709 --> 08:58.625
and you're wacky

08:58.709 --> 09:00.750
and that's what's
important in this
world.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.709
Not what those idiot
girls think of you.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.208
Girls that age it's,
it's like the Serengeti.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.417
Kill or be killed.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.959
I fought with my sister.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.625
Every time I tried
to change the channel

09:16.709 --> 09:19.709
from "The Hardy Boys",
she'd shriek like a banshee.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.250
Why Rita?

09:24.333 --> 09:27.375
- 'Why'd he pick her?'
- It's not for sure yet.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.959
That family.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.000
They just couldn't
let Rita be.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.500
How you feeling?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.625
The medication
makes me, um...

09:46.875 --> 09:48.000
...underwater.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.083
But a little clearer, right?

09:50.166 --> 09:51.375
Hmm.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.208
Okay.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.792
Rita Baxter.

10:02.542 --> 10:05.959
Your sister had a thing
for picking on her.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.458
You remember?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.041
Yeah.

10:13.125 --> 10:14.917
Do you ever see her?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.875
Sometimes.

10:19.959 --> 10:21.041
When you do..

10:25.458 --> 10:28.166
You see these markings?

10:31.959 --> 10:33.959
On her
skin.
All over.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.583
Black pen.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.417
You put those on her?

10:37.500 --> 10:38.834
No.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.417
But you put them
on Caitlin Gaither.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.000
Why?

10:44.667 --> 10:46.375
To make her like Rita.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.333
And you wanted to hurt her
like you hurt Rita?

10:48.417 --> 10:50.917
No.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.208
I wasn't...poison back then.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.375
- Maybe without meaning it.
- No!

10:56.458 --> 10:59.625
- Okay, Neil--
- You don't understand.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.792
Go ahead.

11:01.875 --> 11:07.125
It was my first time.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.834
(Brandi)
'Okay, Neil.'

11:11.917 --> 11:14.250
Eww, it's over.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.458
So, now you've gone
to first base.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.500
You can go.
We're done with you.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.667
Neil, come back
and visit later.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.291
Not!

11:27.250 --> 11:28.500
So, how was it?

11:28.583 --> 11:31.041
'Specifically?'

11:31.125 --> 11:32.125
Warm.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.750
Now Rita's getting hot!

11:42.417 --> 11:43.792
(Scotty)
'So when was that?'

11:43.875 --> 11:46.625
- The night she died.
- You sure?

11:46.709 --> 11:49.583
My sister had her over for a..

11:49.667 --> 11:51.834
...a sleepover.

11:51.917 --> 11:55.875
So did you do something
to Rita later that night?

11:55.959 --> 11:57.500
It wasn't me.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.834
I killed that
other girl,
but..

12:00.750 --> 12:01.750
...not Rita.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.083
Who did?

12:04.041 --> 12:06.041
It was the house.

12:07.417 --> 12:09.625
It's an evil house.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.291
Neil, the whack-job,
can say what he wants.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.625
I know he's our guy.

12:20.709 --> 12:21.875
Parents were out
of town that night.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.291
He's in charge.
That's opportunity.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.291
- Motive?
- He's a whack-job.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.291
(Lilly)
'Whether Neil's telling
the truth or not'

12:27.375 --> 12:29.208
we still got three girls
who never spoke up

12:29.291 --> 12:31.000
about being with Rita
that night.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.291
Fourteen years, biggest case

12:32.375 --> 12:34.083
to hit Chestnut Hill
and they clam up?

12:34.166 --> 12:35.500
That's shady.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.917
Brandi Beaudry, Ariel Shuman,
Tiffany O'Connell.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.041
Those were the girls the
mother remembers hassling Rita.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.917
Kill her over
a game of Barbies?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Beat her with
the dream Corvette?

12:44.083 --> 12:45.750
We went to the
school
first time around.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.417
How did those girls
get overlooked?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.417
Three most popular
girls in school

12:49.500 --> 12:51.792
having a sleepover with Rita?

12:51.875 --> 12:53.333
Violates the social order.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.458
Especially if Buffy, Muffy
and Trixie ain't talking.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.000
Sounds like it's time
to introduce yourselves

12:57.083 --> 12:59.750
to the divas
of Chestnut Collegiate.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.083
Those are wrinkles.
Do you see what I'm saying?

13:08.166 --> 13:09.500
I said creases.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.208
Brandi Beaudry?

13:14.458 --> 13:15.709
Yeah, I'm Brandi.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.208
Detectives Valens
and Rush, homicide.

13:18.291 --> 13:21.208
If this is about my brother,
I'd be by his side right now

13:21.291 --> 13:22.959
if I didn't have
this party to plan.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.875
So, no, I'm not going
to help you put him away.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.792
We ain't here about
Caitlin Gaither.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.250
What, then?

13:31.333 --> 13:32.375
Why didn't you ever
tell anyone

13:32.458 --> 13:33.792
Rita Baxter was at your house

13:33.875 --> 13:36.375
the night she died?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.667
[chuckles]
I don't know what
you're talking
about.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.709
Brandi, a girl
was murdered.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.250
Fourteen years go by,
and you never say anything?

13:43.333 --> 13:45.500
You realize how
that makes you look.

13:47.250 --> 13:51.834
She came by, okay? But she left
in the middle of the night.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.625
I don't know
anything
about how she died.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.917
So, why keep
the sleepover secret?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.417
We were afraid.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.250
We thought we'd be blamed
just because we'd been with
her.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.417
I'm sorry, seriously,
but we were 12.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.250
So, what's your
excuse now? Seriously.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.750
Girl's club
code of silence?

14:07.834 --> 14:10.333
Not at all, I haven't talked
to Ariel or Tiffany

14:10.417 --> 14:12.417
in, like, a million years.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.750
Is that an exact figure?

14:13.834 --> 14:14.959
High school. Maybe.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.625
Let's start with this, Brandi.

14:16.709 --> 14:21.458
How's a girl like Rita wind up
at a sleepover at your house?

14:21.542 --> 14:23.875
We invited her
because we thought

14:23.959 --> 14:26.083
it would be funny
to mess with her.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.583
We were brats.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.250
Who came up with
this great plan?

14:30.333 --> 14:32.250
It was Ariel's idea.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.625
Hi, Rita.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.834
You could say hi back.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.333
Hi.

14:50.625 --> 14:54.458
Brandi thinks you're cool, and
she wants to hang out with you.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.667
I have to go home.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.709
Rita, this is the
chance
of a lifetime.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.667
It is way better being with
them
than being a nerd in gifted.

15:06.417 --> 15:07.500
Hey, Rita.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.041
Cute sneakers.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.083
So, my parents are
in the Bahamas

15:11.166 --> 15:12.834
and we're having
a sleepover tonight.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.083
I want you to come,
but you can't tell you mom

15:15.166 --> 15:18.333
because well, I don't
really have permission.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.792
Ariel, is this a trick?

15:21.875 --> 15:24.625
No! She for real
wants you there.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.625
I do, too.

15:29.625 --> 15:33.458
I could sneak out after
my mom goes to bed.

15:37.750 --> 15:41.500
She came over
at,
like, 10:00.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.166
And, like, two hours later

15:44.250 --> 15:47.792
we hid her glasses from
her,
she freaked out and left.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.709
Who knows what happened
after that?

15:49.792 --> 15:52.208
I mean, she died, obviously.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.125
But you don't know
anything about that?

15:54.208 --> 15:57.208
If I did, I would tell you.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.291
I'm glad you know.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.083
It was wrong
not to speak up.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.417
It was your idea, though

16:10.500 --> 16:12.375
to invite Rita to the party
and razz her.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.083
At the time, I thought
I was giving her the keys

16:14.166 --> 16:17.542
to the kingdom, getting her
to Brandi Beaudry's house.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.709
How's that?

16:18.792 --> 16:21.333
She was the most popular
girl in school.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.208
Rita and I, not so popular.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.542
But when Rita got
to the sleepover

16:24.625 --> 16:25.917
you laid into her
like you planned?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.667
Not like I'd planned.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.041
I mean, I had no idea.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.208
I was JV.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.875
Those two were
varsity bitches.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.125
Boys don't think you're
anything if you have fat.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.834
Eww! See?

16:47.750 --> 16:48.792
Gross.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.375
Yeah.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.041
Get her butt.

17:04.417 --> 17:05.792
Ariel, it's your turn.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.417
To pick a spot on Rita.

17:11.792 --> 17:13.250
Right here.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.709
Back fat.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.417
You have a fat gut
like your mom.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.667
She's really
ugly.
No offense.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.792
I don't want to do
this anymore.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.291
Tiffany! Way to go.
Now she's pissed.

17:29.375 --> 17:32.750
So? Did you know there's
a rumor your mom is a
slut?

17:34.709 --> 17:37.125
Everybody's
saying it.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.500
Oh.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.542
- Explains the marks.
- Sick, right?

17:49.625 --> 17:52.458
So what happened
after the fat fest?

17:52.542 --> 17:54.542
Rita ran out.

17:54.625 --> 17:55.750
Didn't come back.

17:55.834 --> 17:56.917
Anyone go after her?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.125
None of us.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.500
How about Neil?

17:59.583 --> 18:01.208
I didn't see that.
I guess it's possible.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.125
I thought Brandi
was the ringleader.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.208
Why was Tiffany so nasty?

18:05.291 --> 18:08.500
Tiffany's dad and Rita's mom
had a thing going.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.000
And Tiffany knew about it?

18:10.083 --> 18:13.667
But Rita didn't,
and Tiffany didn't let on.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.208
Maybe she was just waiting
for the right moment.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.709
Why would
she sneak out?

18:18.792 --> 18:21.542
And to be with
those awful girls?

18:21.625 --> 18:23.750
Popularity stuff?

18:23.834 --> 18:26.000
I did have an
affair with him.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.709
We thought
we were discreet.

18:27.792 --> 18:29.333
I didn't think
Tiffany knew.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.500
You think Tiffany was
capable of violence?

18:31.583 --> 18:33.667
I never really got
to know her.

18:33.750 --> 18:37.834
After Rita, well, married men
lose interest in a woman

18:37.917 --> 18:40.583
who can't get out of bed
in the morning.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.458
You hear what Tiffany's
doing these days?

18:42.542 --> 18:46.583
I only know she was kicked out
of collegiate in eighth grade.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.041
Drinking problem.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.041
She was the apple of her
dad's eye before then.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.709
Drinking? That young?

18:51.792 --> 18:55.250
Sounds like something threw
Trixie for a loop.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.500
Detective Valens,
Philadelphia PD.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.542
Crap.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.875
We know you had
it in for Rita

19:16.959 --> 19:20.208
her mom having that
affair with your
dad.

19:20.291 --> 19:24.000
Well, you ride her hard
enough,
she leaves the sleepover.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.333
Then what?

19:25.417 --> 19:26.875
Then nothing.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.458
Follow her into the woods,
get rid of her at Devil's
Pool?

19:29.542 --> 19:32.083
You're way off. Sorry.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.625
Now, how's a rich girl
from Chestnut Hill

19:34.709 --> 19:36.750
wind up on house arrest
in Mount Airy

19:36.834 --> 19:38.417
after multiple DUI's?

19:38.500 --> 19:41.250
How? Tequila.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.667
Somethin' went wrong, Tiffany.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.000
- Real wrong.
- That's your opinion.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.542
To me, I'm glad I got out
of Chestnut Hill.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.333
Yeah?

19:50.417 --> 19:52.291
Do me one favor?

19:52.375 --> 19:55.083
Is that bitch Brandi
still a bitch?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.166
I knew it.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.959
Oh, what a bitch!

20:08.333 --> 20:11.291
I hated Rita
and her slut mom

20:11.375 --> 20:15.333
about as much as I
hated my jackass dad.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.667
But I didn't have it
in me to kill her.

20:17.750 --> 20:22.834
- No?
- Not like they did.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.583
My father, his attitude..

20:25.667 --> 20:28.208
Why does Sporto
like the ugly girl?

20:28.291 --> 20:29.792
Claire's much prettier.

20:31.542 --> 20:33.583
It'd suck to have red hair.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.125
Oh, my God!

20:37.083 --> 20:38.959
Rita thinks the nerd is cute.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.792
No, I don't.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.917
Give me your glasses.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.291
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to see them.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.041
Eww! You're blind.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.333
You have weird eyes
in real life. No offense.

21:02.417 --> 21:04.000
Can I have them back, please?

21:07.417 --> 21:08.542
No.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.458
My parents. Hide!

21:12.542 --> 21:14.000
Hide!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.458
Hi, there.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.500
What's your name, hon?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.417
Rita Baxter.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.125
Where's your brother?

21:34.208 --> 21:37.208
- Asleep.
- Will you get him up?

21:38.375 --> 21:39.792
Why?

21:39.875 --> 21:43.083
- Holly?
- 'Yeah, hon?'

21:43.166 --> 21:45.875
Will you run
a bath
upstairs?

21:45.959 --> 21:47.250
Sure.

21:50.291 --> 21:53.083
How many people did my daughter
have over tonight, Rita?

21:55.458 --> 21:56.750
Wall.

22:00.792 --> 22:06.166
- How many girls were here?
- Um...just one. Just me.

22:06.250 --> 22:09.542
So you're a liar, too, Rita?

22:09.625 --> 22:10.959
Brandi.

22:11.041 --> 22:14.667
Want to tell your friend what
we do to liars in this house?

22:21.291 --> 22:24.250
The Beaudrys said they were
out of town that night.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.792
And you believed them 'cause
they didn't look the type.

22:27.875 --> 22:28.959
What type is that?

22:29.041 --> 22:31.834
The
lying-and-beating-their-kids
type.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.250
Think they could
have hurt Rita?

22:33.333 --> 22:35.917
I got out of there
after that.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
But you know things are bad
when the biggest bitch in
school

22:39.083 --> 22:41.834
looks like she's gonna
piss in her Calvin's.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.667
Someone's been telling you lies.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.417
Yeah, you.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.917
Rita was at your house
the night she died.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.250
Didn't you think that was
worth mentioning to the cops?

22:57.333 --> 22:59.417
It's my daughter, isn't it?

22:59.500 --> 23:01.291
You talked to her.

23:01.375 --> 23:06.875
Well, keep in mind,
she's a drug addict and a
liar.

23:06.959 --> 23:10.291
Brandi wasn't supposed to have
friends over unsupervised.

23:10.375 --> 23:13.083
So, who got in
trouble,
Brandi or the
friend?

23:13.166 --> 23:15.125
I'm sorry if we scared
the Baxter girl

23:15.208 --> 23:16.542
but we didn't touch her.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.792
Our children needed
special attention.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.959
Sometimes, yes, we were
physical with them.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.917
And other times
you were on vacation.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.333
We were afraid of her.

23:26.417 --> 23:27.834
(Jason)
'When they're really
little'

23:27.917 --> 23:29.667
'you can't tell
the difference.'

23:29.750 --> 23:32.291
Biting, kicking.

23:32.375 --> 23:33.875
And she's older?

23:33.959 --> 23:37.083
And it's nothin'
normal kid stuff.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.500
What's not?

23:38.583 --> 23:40.375
We had a...a cat.

23:40.458 --> 23:45.500
The nanny came in and found her
wrapping it up in a towel.

23:45.583 --> 23:48.625
Brandi said it drowned,
but..

23:48.709 --> 23:51.875
...what's the cat doing
in a full bathtub?

23:51.959 --> 23:53.083
Right.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.083
She was capable
of things

23:56.166 --> 23:58.291
no parent wants
to think about.

23:58.375 --> 24:00.667
Like killing Rita?

24:10.417 --> 24:13.500
I have a meeting in 40 minutes
and this takes 20.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.375
A wash-and-go is gonna
have to do today.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.750
I can't have my whole life
thrown off over this thing--

24:16.834 --> 24:18.959
Your parents
think
you killed Rita.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.667
My parents are freaks.

24:26.125 --> 24:28.458
- You gotta stop lying,
Brandi.
- What?

24:28.542 --> 24:31.625
Your mom and dad came home that
night discovered the sleepover.

24:31.709 --> 24:33.625
You said they
were
in the Bahamas.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.458
They were always somewhere.
Maybe I got confused.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.291
We know they were violent with
you and Neil when you were kids

24:38.375 --> 24:43.917
but they said, they had to
be
because you were
disturbed.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.500
Hurt things.

24:47.959 --> 24:50.834
If they're talking
about that stupid cat.

24:50.917 --> 24:53.667
Hurting animals means
something, Brandi.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.041
I was an angry kid.

25:03.500 --> 25:04.834
Guess why?

25:06.083 --> 25:08.709
Tell me about them
coming home that
night.

25:13.750 --> 25:17.875
They didn't like when
I had friends over.

25:23.333 --> 25:26.625
Mom, I told them
all to go home.

25:26.709 --> 25:28.083
It's too late, Brandi.

25:28.166 --> 25:30.083
You lied.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.000
(Neil)
'Dad, it's not her fault.'

25:32.083 --> 25:34.000
I was in charge.

25:34.959 --> 25:37.041
Dad, no! No!

25:37.125 --> 25:39.750
- No!
- Neil, honey, please.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.625
This is important.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.166
Dad.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.583
Dad!

26:20.667 --> 26:21.792
Hold.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.417
Done.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.458
She was supposed
to go home.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.792
I don't know why
she came back.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.291
Then my mom saw her.

27:11.375 --> 27:15.208
Neil and I were sent
to our rooms.

27:17.792 --> 27:19.834
And in the morning..

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
...she was dead.

27:24.417 --> 27:25.959
Thank you.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.000
I know that was hard.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.041
No.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.792
I've said it a million
times in my head.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.542
The parents were right
about the drugs.

27:44.625 --> 27:47.083
Brandi was picked up
for forging a prescription

27:47.166 --> 27:48.417
back in July.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.917
Charges were dropped.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.750
Dilaudin.
Synthetic morphine.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.709
- That's heavy
self-medicating.
- And she's the healthy kid.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.458
Not the way the parents tell it.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.458
Brandi thinks her parents killed
Rita to keep the abuse a secret.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.333
And they're saying
she's the violent one.

28:03.417 --> 28:04.750
Happy home.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.667
Maybe I'll go talk to Neil.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.500
They moved him to western
psychiatric.

28:18.041 --> 28:21.083
Go see Elisa
while you're there?

28:21.166 --> 28:24.166
Nah. It's not
the right time.

28:27.083 --> 28:30.291
I know what your parents
made you do to your sister.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.500
- The dunking?
- Yeah.

28:33.583 --> 28:36.125
That's what you did to
Caitlin,
right? You held her down.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.417
I didn't want
to hurt her.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.458
What happened?

28:40.542 --> 28:42.792
I, uh, I go every year

28:42.875 --> 28:46.458
'cause...I miss Rita.

28:46.542 --> 28:51.500
And this time I
thought I saw
her.

28:51.583 --> 28:53.625
But it was Caitlin Gaither.

28:53.709 --> 28:57.083
I thought she was
Rita.
I don't know why.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.500
And you put those marks
on this girl like Rita's

28:59.583 --> 29:02.583
to kind of...recreate her?

29:02.667 --> 29:05.500
But this girl..

29:05.583 --> 29:06.959
...didn't care about me.

29:07.041 --> 29:10.542
She was afraid and screamed.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.083
I guess I needed
her to be quiet

29:12.166 --> 29:15.291
and we were at the water,
so, I held her down.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.917
For too long.

29:20.208 --> 29:22.709
Well, Rita was pushed,
not held down.

29:22.792 --> 29:25.083
I didn't do that to Rita.

29:25.166 --> 29:28.667
She was kind.
I wouldn't hurt
her.

29:32.917 --> 29:36.000
What about your parents
that night?

29:36.083 --> 29:39.834
They never left their
room
after we were punished.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.375
And Brandi?

29:51.500 --> 29:54.625
- She was violent, right?
- It's not her fault.

29:57.458 --> 30:00.625
So what happened after Rita
saw you in the bathroom?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.709
She tried to save us.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.375
I saw what your parents
were doing.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.208
It's wrong.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.542
You should tell
another adult.

30:29.625 --> 30:32.333
We could go right now
and tell my mom.

30:32.417 --> 30:33.875
She could help us.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.458
It's not right.

30:36.542 --> 30:37.667
You're not bad.

30:39.375 --> 30:42.542
- We could go.
- What are you talking about?

30:43.375 --> 30:44.583
Get out of my room.

30:44.667 --> 30:47.250
You don't need
to be embarrassed.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.750
It happens to other kids, too.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.458
- Brandi?
- Nothing is happening!

30:55.542 --> 30:57.750
Get out of my room, loser!
Get out!

30:57.834 --> 31:00.250
I can help you.
We can go to my mom.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.250
I don't need your help.
You're a loser.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.959
You are dead.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.250
Close the door.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.000
- Why are you guys still
here?
- We can't go home.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.250
It's 2:00 in the morning.

31:13.333 --> 31:16.208
Your parents didn't
see us. We snuck up.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.000
Are you guys in a fight?

31:19.083 --> 31:20.583
I hate her.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.750
And I want her to die!

31:24.458 --> 31:26.250
She needs to die.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.417
Right?

31:32.917 --> 31:34.250
Right.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.291
Right.

31:46.709 --> 31:48.750
What then, Neil?

31:51.083 --> 31:55.792
They kicked me out,
and I left her in
there..

31:57.709 --> 31:59.250
...with all of them.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.375
We know one of you
killed Rita.

32:23.458 --> 32:26.000
The two of you who didn't,
should save yourselves.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.875
You got something
to tell, huh?

32:30.917 --> 32:34.542
I'm getting a cup of coffee
and I'll be back.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.333
It's better than
a reunion, right?

32:38.417 --> 32:42.583
Yeah, I bet they're wishing
we had an open bar.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.917
[chuckles]
You've sure changed.

32:50.291 --> 32:52.750
Are they serious?

32:52.834 --> 32:56.875
- This doesn't even seem real.
- It's not me. Clearly.

32:56.959 --> 32:59.000
Oh, clearly.

32:59.083 --> 33:02.667
- One of you said something.
- There's nothing to tell.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.917
Ariel's pretty insistent.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.417
It was you, wasn't it?

33:08.500 --> 33:12.000
- You'd love to see me go
down.
- I think they can hear us.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.959
Middle school's over. I'm not
hung up about you anymore.

33:15.041 --> 33:16.417
Oh, Tiffany's got something.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.542
- 'Are you threatening her?'
- 'It's okay.'

33:18.625 --> 33:21.291
I mean, look at her.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.959
She's just sad.

33:24.041 --> 33:26.583
Guess what, bitch?
Time to buy a diary.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.959
'Cause I'm not keeping
your secrets anymore.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.417
Shut up.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.625
Don't tell me what to do!

33:31.709 --> 33:33.208
Tiffany, sit down!

33:37.667 --> 33:39.250
Ah, they're good
and ready now.

33:39.333 --> 33:40.750
I'll pull Tiffany.

33:43.083 --> 33:45.250
Those two were
your best pals,
huh?

33:45.333 --> 33:46.417
Brandi and Ariel.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.125
Friggin' time warp
in there.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.709
Haven't changed much?

33:49.792 --> 33:53.375
Shows you what crap taste you
have in friends when you're
12.

33:53.458 --> 33:55.125
You're different though.

33:55.208 --> 33:56.834
Ain't buying into the games.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.709
I'm the only sane
one of the three.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.792
I'm not perfect though.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.792
Whatever you did, bet
it wasn't as bad as them.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.667
They get their perfect
lives. Me?

34:12.750 --> 34:15.750
I'm innocent,
and I get wrecked.

34:17.500 --> 34:21.750
That's 'cause I'm the one
who saw her face.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.792
Well, we could poison her.

34:30.875 --> 34:33.834
Or hang her. I learned
knots at sailing.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.500
I think I better go home.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.667
Guard the door,
she'll get out.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.125
This is lame.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.000
When can we do ouija board?

34:42.083 --> 34:43.291
After we kill her.

34:48.417 --> 34:49.667
Blood sisters?

34:49.750 --> 34:50.959
Right.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.250
Eww.

34:54.709 --> 34:56.583
You have to.
It's a pact.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.208
'Okay.'

34:58.291 --> 34:59.625
You're crazy.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.166
This is seriously
the worst
sleepover

35:01.250 --> 35:04.208
I've ever been to
in my entire life.

35:04.291 --> 35:05.834
You can't leave.

35:05.917 --> 35:10.208
- Brandi wants to make a pact.
- Ariel, get over it.

35:10.291 --> 35:11.250
Rita, come on.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.500
(Brandi)
'No.'

35:13.583 --> 35:14.834
She's ours.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.208
Whatever.

35:29.792 --> 35:31.542
I was gonna go home.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.125
But?

35:33.208 --> 35:36.166
I went downstairs.

35:36.250 --> 35:40.166
And I met the love
of my young life.

35:41.166 --> 35:43.166
An adult's liquor cabinet.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.166
I drank whatever
was open

35:45.250 --> 35:48.166
and right before
I passed out

35:48.250 --> 35:53.500
I thought, "I gotta start
hanging out with boys
instead."

36:01.417 --> 36:02.667
This is killing me.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.750
(Lilly)
'Brandi's jonesin'.'

36:09.834 --> 36:11.250
Time for her afternoon dose.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.959
And why's she looking for it
in Ariel's purse?

36:17.417 --> 36:19.542
You need a doctor
to get dilaudin.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.000
Ariel's a doctor.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.500
She could lose her license
for prescribing to an addict.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.542
So why is she doing it?
Old time's sake?

36:29.625 --> 36:32.959
I think Brandi may have
a specific old time in
mind.

36:38.834 --> 36:41.750
You look like you
could
use some fresh air.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.250
Yeah.

36:43.333 --> 36:46.208
Junkies generally don't
like
these windowless rooms.

36:48.792 --> 36:49.875
What do you want?

36:49.959 --> 36:51.625
Ariel's your
supplier,
isn't she?

36:51.709 --> 36:54.834
Well, that connection
dries up right here and
now.

36:54.917 --> 36:56.250
You tell me what
you've got on her

36:56.333 --> 36:57.458
you can go home
and gobble up

36:57.542 --> 36:59.000
the rest of
what she gave
you.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.291
That's crazy.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.792
What are you,
Brandi, loyal?

37:02.875 --> 37:04.333
You're a survivor.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.083
You take what you
need from people

37:06.166 --> 37:08.250
then lose them when
they're not useful
anymore.

37:08.333 --> 37:12.834
And I'm telling you,
Ariel's tapped out.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.083
What do you want to know?

37:19.166 --> 37:22.542
What happened to Rita after
Tiffany left her with you
two?

37:22.625 --> 37:24.625
I got bored.
Said goodnight.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.583
Tiffany can't say anything.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.250
She'll be in as big
trouble as us.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.333
I don't care.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.417
- It's over.
- What?

37:39.500 --> 37:41.375
I think you should go home
with that loser.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.333
Me? No, why?
I want to stay.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.041
Because we're not
friends anymore.

37:46.125 --> 37:49.875
No offense, but I thought
you were cool and you're
not.

37:49.959 --> 37:51.417
You two are
better
off as friends.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.250
I don't want to be
her friend.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.917
I want to be your friend.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.125
You're the one
who brought her here

37:56.208 --> 37:58.625
and she ruined
the sleepover.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.750
I want you two
losers
to leave my house.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.208
- But--
- Get out.

38:09.458 --> 38:11.959
And don't sit with us
at lunch anymore.

38:18.417 --> 38:20.125
Minute later, I looked
out the window.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.166
They were cutting
through the backyard

38:22.250 --> 38:23.834
heading to the woods.

38:26.125 --> 38:27.542
I could hear Ariel crying

38:27.625 --> 38:29.959
from all the way
up in my room.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.959
It's just a lunch table.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.583
Don't go crazy.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.041
What are you looking at?

38:40.959 --> 38:43.125
Nothing.

38:50.166 --> 38:52.041
What did you think would happen
when you got caught?

38:52.125 --> 38:53.375
Sorry?

38:53.458 --> 38:55.667
You'd tell the hospital
it was a mistake?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.583
(Lilly)
'You had no idea'

38:58.667 --> 39:00.834
Brandi Beaudry was an addict.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.917
She just told you
she was in pain.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
She is in pain.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.792
Her life..

39:09.834 --> 39:10.959
You can't imagine.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.083
How long she been making
you do things for her?

39:16.166 --> 39:18.250
It was just a favor
that got mixed up.

39:18.333 --> 39:21.834
It was blackmail, Ariel.
Always has been.

39:21.917 --> 39:24.333
Because she knows
what you did.

39:24.417 --> 39:26.583
No.

39:43.792 --> 39:45.625
Do you hate me?

39:47.208 --> 39:49.959
It doesn't matter
what I think of you.

39:54.208 --> 39:56.625
She was just
a little kid.

39:56.709 --> 39:59.166
But I was
just
a little kid,
too.

39:59.250 --> 40:02.041
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
I didn't know
you live through
it.

40:12.083 --> 40:16.792
- 'My life is over.'
- 'We'll be home soon.'

40:16.875 --> 40:19.375
I don't want to go home.

40:19.458 --> 40:22.000
So what if she
thinks we're losers?

40:22.083 --> 40:25.667
We'll be losers for
junior high, I don't care.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.750
My mom says everybody
who's ever been anything

40:28.834 --> 40:30.792
in the world,
was a loser.

40:30.875 --> 40:32.291
I care.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.917
Just because you don't,
why do I have to suffer?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.083
In six years we'll
be in college

40:37.166 --> 40:39.667
and my mom said
we'll be cool.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.458
I can't wait for college.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.959
Six years?

40:43.041 --> 40:44.291
Oh, my God!

40:44.375 --> 40:47.875
Brandi's gonna hate me
for six years.

40:47.959 --> 40:50.834
So what if those idiot girls
don't like you?

40:50.917 --> 40:53.250
That's not what
matters
in this world.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.166
It's better to be smart
and different, like us.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.041
No.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.166
I don't want to
be like us.

40:59.250 --> 41:03.667
But, Ariel, in
college,
we'll be considered
cool.

41:03.750 --> 41:07.208
And maybe before then

41:07.291 --> 41:10.250
we could be best
friends
to each other.

41:11.125 --> 41:13.458
If you want.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.083
No!
