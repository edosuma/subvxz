00:26.819 --> 00:28.279
Elena.

00:29.780 --> 00:33.451
I know this must seem like
the darkest day of your life.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.037
I know you miss your mother

00:37.288 --> 00:39.498
and even though
she's not here right now,

00:39.749 --> 00:41.375
she'll always love you.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.213
You understand that, don't you, darling?

00:46.338 --> 00:47.423
Yes, Daddy.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.845
But, I'm going to be around more.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.723
I will always be here.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.477
Promise?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.314
I promise.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.779
Traps his victims...

01:10.446 --> 01:11.822
People still missing.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.116
String of murders.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.201
Vicious crime spree.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.535
We're dedicating every...

01:16.619 --> 01:17.579
...available resource...

01:17.661 --> 01:19.205
...to hunt this man down.

01:40.518 --> 01:41.519
A serial killer has...

01:41.602 --> 01:44.313
...claimed yet another victim,
in what has become...

01:44.438 --> 01:47.316
...the most vicious crime spree
in our city's history.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.484
This unprecedented...

01:48.609 --> 01:50.820
...series of violent murders has many...

01:51.153 --> 01:52.154
...staying indoors...

01:52.279 --> 01:53.739
...and living in fear.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.576
Good morning.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.328
Here's what we can share at this time.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.914
The assailant traps his victims...

02:02.206 --> 02:02.832
...in homes...

02:03.124 --> 02:04.708
...businesses, or work places...

02:05.584 --> 02:06.752
then kills them.

02:07.253 --> 02:08.253
However, it appears

02:08.378 --> 02:09.880
that he takes one victim
from each crime scene.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.383
These people may still
be alive and held captive.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.847
With over 50 people still missing...

02:18.180 --> 02:20.182
...grieving families
are seeking answers...

02:20.307 --> 02:22.309
...and authorities have begun a manhunt.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.687
That's right people.
The latest in a string of murders.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.572
The killer seems...

02:25.604 --> 02:27.314
...to strike without
any pattern, which...

02:27.398 --> 02:29.191
...makes it impossible for police...

02:29.316 --> 02:31.402
...to track his moves with...

02:34.280 --> 02:36.157
...is best described
as a predator without...

02:36.282 --> 02:38.284
...boundaries. Targeting men, women,

02:38.367 --> 02:39.577
children, young, old,

02:39.660 --> 02:40.870
he does not discriminate.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.456
The latest missing person
is no stranger to crime himself.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.167
Arkin O'Brien is a...

02:46.250 --> 02:48.836
...twice convicted thief
who was abducted shortly...

02:48.919 --> 02:51.714
...after paramedics
responded to a 9-1-1 call.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.549
O'Brien's wife, Lisa...

02:53.632 --> 02:55.676
...recently reacted to the abduction.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.306
Whoever's watching this.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.976
Please, if you see this...
and you have him...

03:04.518 --> 03:05.769
...please let him go.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.189
Please...

03:08.314 --> 03:09.481
...let him go.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.410
We will hunt this man down.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.705
We are on his trail and
we will bring him to justice.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.811
Hey. Are you here?

03:47.895 --> 03:50.231
Yeah, I'm not going to be able to
make it tonight, babe.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.565
I gotta work till close.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.401
I'll make it up to you though,
something real special.

03:54.485 --> 03:55.402
Okay?

03:55.486 --> 03:56.987
Who you talkin' to? Come on!

03:57.321 --> 03:58.822
Let's go already!

03:58.948 --> 03:59.573
All right?

03:59.657 --> 04:01.450
Okay. You're off the hook.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.409
Yeah?

04:02.493 --> 04:03.244
Yeah.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.008
I love you, babe.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.829
I love you. I love you so much.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.249
I love you, too.

04:23.430 --> 04:23.930
Hey, Missy.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.391
What are you doing?

04:25.516 --> 04:28.435
Studying now. Brian bailed on me.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.480
Good. Get dressed.
I'm taking you to a party.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.607
Uh, I don't know.
I'm kind of tired.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.012
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.361
Yeah. Yeah, I got ya.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.696
Look out your window.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.583
I'll be down in five.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.668
Thank you, Marcus.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.712
We are now going live
to Nikki Johnson...

04:54.795 --> 04:56.116
...reporting live at the scene...

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
...of the latest attacks.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.925
A serial killer
has claimed yet another victim,

05:00.050 --> 05:04.013
in what has become the most vicious
crime spree in our city's history.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.349
This unprecedented series
of violent murders

05:07.433 --> 05:10.644
has many staying indoors
and living in fear.

05:10.728 --> 05:14.565
And now, with over 50 people
still missing grieving families...

05:14.648 --> 05:15.941
...are seeking answers...

05:19.903 --> 05:21.739
Did I pick the right shirt?

05:22.364 --> 05:23.657
It's not about the shirt,
little brother.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.075
It's about how you wear it.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.329
All girls say that,
dude, and none of it is true.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.581
Every detail counts.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.749
I've been workin' on some lines...

05:31.832 --> 05:33.375
- ...and I was thinkin' that if I...
- Okay, stop.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.002
First off, don't call me dude.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.587
Look, when you
wanna be with a woman

05:36.712 --> 05:37.963
you don't walk up to her and say, hi,

05:38.047 --> 05:39.715
I'd like to sleep with you.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.343
You say, nice shoes.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.386
Does that make sense?

05:44.470 --> 05:45.054
Hmm.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.890
Just try wearing some
confidence for a change.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.893
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

05:52.770 --> 05:53.937
Hey, Josh.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.690
Nice shoes.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.918
I can't believe your dad
let you out the house

06:16.001 --> 06:17.836
- with that psycho on the loose.
- He didn't.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.712
Really?

06:18.796 --> 06:20.547
Where is this place, anyway?

06:20.672 --> 06:21.673
It's private here.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.009
Password to get in.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.844
Which is what?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.137
Nevermore.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.724
Wow, this... really looks inviting.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.977
This has to be it.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.649
Okay, that's gotta be the door guy.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.609
Go tell him the password.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.654
Um...

06:45.614 --> 06:46.782
...nevermore.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.065
Nice shoes.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.945
Stay down!

10:13.238 --> 10:14.615
Stay here!

11:07.084 --> 11:08.085
Get out of my way!

11:08.210 --> 11:09.086
Move!

11:09.211 --> 11:10.420
Move!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.007
Move, bitch!

11:15.217 --> 11:16.218
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:16.301 --> 11:17.719
Fuck!

11:28.980 --> 11:30.023
Stay down.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.442
You gotta help me.

11:32.984 --> 11:33.985
You gotta help, come on.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.278
- You gotta help me.
- No!

11:36.363 --> 11:38.073
Help me. You gotta help me.

11:55.716 --> 11:56.837
- Move!
- Man, what happened?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.468
- What is it?
- Brian?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.476
Oh, shit. This way, over here.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.485
Shit!

12:19.823 --> 12:21.116
Oh, my God!

12:39.843 --> 12:41.386
Elle! Elle!

12:41.470 --> 12:44.014
Elle! Please! Oh, my God!

12:44.097 --> 12:45.348
It won't stop!

12:45.474 --> 12:46.933
Help me!

12:47.017 --> 12:49.478
- Push on it, Missy! Push on it!
- Can you shut it off?!

12:50.187 --> 12:51.062
No!

13:13.335 --> 13:15.337
Push on it, Missy! Push on it!

13:15.420 --> 13:17.255
No! No!

14:08.473 --> 14:09.850
Look out!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.165
Okay. What do we got here?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.461
- I need you to stay calm.
- Where's my family?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.296
- Where's my wife at?
- I need you to stay calm.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.214
- My arm hurts bad.
- Pack it in...

15:23.298 --> 15:24.257
...20 milligrams of Versidep...

15:24.382 --> 15:25.467
...push 10 milligrams of morphine.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.551
Right now.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.427
Can you tell me your name?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.470
Arkin.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.639
Please note scratches on subject's
right arm are self-inflicted.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.516
- Hold on to him please.
- 1... 2... 3...

15:33.642 --> 15:35.685
Oh, fuck!

15:36.186 --> 15:37.520
Hey, we need
some help in here right now!

15:37.646 --> 15:39.689
Let's go! Over here, hold him down.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.066
Hold his arm down.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.152
Morphine, push 10 milligrams. Now!

15:44.235 --> 15:45.320
Hey, you can't be in here

15:45.403 --> 15:46.571
- Hey, come on. Step back.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

15:46.655 --> 15:49.240
- Get out of here!
- Cuff him! Cuff him!

15:49.324 --> 15:50.659
Whoa. Okay, okay.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.410
Okay, easy guys.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.245
Okay? Easy.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.059
Get it off me! Get it off me!

16:21.982 --> 16:23.108
Lisa.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.994
I thought I'd never see you again.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.414
You ain't that lucky.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.419
What happened to you?

16:46.381 --> 16:50.760
It's okay, baby. I've got you now.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.640
You didn't have to get me flowers.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.021
- I didn't.
- What's that say?

17:03.064 --> 17:04.315
What's it say?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.651
For the collection.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.321
Get well soon,
can't wait to meet the family.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.492
What's wrong?

17:14.617 --> 17:16.286
What's wrong?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.454
What?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.204
Listen to me.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.207
Baby, you got to go to your moms.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.251
- No.
- Go now.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.094
- No.
- Don't tell anyone where you're going.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.378
Don't even pack a bag.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.715
- No, please.
- Go.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.842
- Okay.
- Go, now.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.515
I've got it from here, bud.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.062
Have a good night.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.408
Hello, Arkin.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.619
I told you guys everything I know.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.496
I'm not a cop.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.456
Who are you?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.249
My name's Lucello.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.295
Yo, what the fuck are you doin'?

18:07.420 --> 18:10.090
Relax. I'm here to help you.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.509
I'm working for a man
whose daughter's gone missing.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.552
Did you see her at the party?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.649
Yeah.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.818
Was she alive?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.653
Last time I saw her.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.322
Did he take her?

18:36.241 --> 18:38.451
If you didn't find a body, then maybe.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.161
He always takes one.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.122
Her name's Elena.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.544
I've got 48 hours tops
before she's dead.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.630
I think you have a pretty good idea
where that man might be.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.715
What makes you think
you're gonna find this guy

18:52.799 --> 18:53.883
when the cops can't?

18:54.217 --> 18:56.386
Because I am
willing to do things they won't.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.348
I have assembled a team
and we are gonna find him and kill him.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.604
What's the plan?

19:07.897 --> 19:10.316
He's gonna lead us to
where Elena's being held.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.318
What about the police?

19:13.570 --> 19:15.196
They had their chance.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.615
What this man deserves
is beyond the law.

19:19.367 --> 19:23.329
She's all I have. Find her.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.290
Sir, I've always been there for you.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.208
She'll be home tonight.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.668
Thank you, Lucello.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.266
Lena.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.226
Dad!

19:46.352 --> 19:47.687
Daddy!

19:48.229 --> 19:53.318
- Elena!
- Daddy!

19:56.571 --> 19:58.239
I got you.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.741
I got ya.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.416
Hello?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.543
Who's... who's out there?

20:11.336 --> 20:13.421
Oh, my God.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.780
Get away!

20:40.490 --> 20:41.699
Get away from me!

20:41.783 --> 20:43.451
Get away! Get away!

20:43.534 --> 20:46.329
Please! Get... get...

20:46.704 --> 20:48.248
Get away from me!

22:06.659 --> 22:07.827
We're goin' in for the girl tonight.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.704
And this man, Arkin O'Brien,

22:09.787 --> 22:12.415
is our best chance
to bring her home alive.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.043
Let's be clear about one thing.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.004
I'll help you get there...

22:19.881 --> 22:21.966
...but I will not go inside.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.801
Understood.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.804
You help us find Elena, you walk...

22:27.013 --> 22:28.639
...we do the rest.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.976
Now tell us what we need to know.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.118
If you're gonna find this guy,
you gotta start at the beginning...

22:38.066 --> 22:39.984
...when he threw me into that red trunk.

22:51.913 --> 22:54.791
I cut my forearm
every time I got to 100.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.797
When we turned right
or left I made distinct cuts.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.007
Drive five miles under the speed limit,

23:03.091 --> 23:05.051
stop fully at every stop sign,

23:05.134 --> 23:06.928
don't gun the engine
through the yellows.

23:07.053 --> 23:07.929
Follow my instructions...

23:08.012 --> 23:10.681
I'll take you right to
where he took me. Right.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.771
But you better be prepared, man.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.689
Bring everything you've got.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.066
Because if he... catches you,

23:20.149 --> 23:21.984
he's gonna make you wish you were dead.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.612
Left.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.531
You're not gonna walk
in there like this is...

23:26.614 --> 23:28.491
Sunday dinner because this is his house,

23:28.616 --> 23:31.119
and he will cut your balls off
and feed them to you.

23:35.665 --> 23:36.749
Stop.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.148
This hotel has been
abandoned for years.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.150
This is the place.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.115
You're the expert.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.950
Think you can get us in there?

24:11.534 --> 24:13.453
I'll get you in then I'm outta here.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.948
Oh, God.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.713
Hello?

27:10.796 --> 27:11.922
Watch your back in there.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.717
It's built like a maze.
The whole place is rigged.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.678
That's why you're leading us in.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.809
What are you talkin' about?
That wasn't the fuckin' deal.

27:25.186 --> 27:26.987
It's the same deal Arkin.
I'll kill the guy...

27:27.021 --> 27:28.689
...but you've gotta help us find Elena.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.494
What makes you think
I know where she's at?

27:30.650 --> 27:32.130
Because you're the only person I know

27:32.193 --> 27:35.071
to see the inside
of this hotel and live.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.745
Ladies first.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.121
Eat a dick.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.669
Guard the door. Stay on the radio.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.194
There's something moving in there.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.239
No way, man.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.992
Point that gun at my head.
No fuckin' way... I'm not goin'.

29:03.451 --> 29:04.952
You already abandoned that girl once.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.495
You gonna do it again?

29:09.915 --> 29:12.251
At least give me something
to protect myself with.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.382
Are you kiddin' me?

29:18.507 --> 29:19.550
Nope.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.522
Lin?

30:37.378 --> 30:38.420
What?

30:47.513 --> 30:48.556
Fuck!

30:50.516 --> 30:51.892
What the fuck was that?

30:54.019 --> 30:55.187
Are you okay?

31:01.902 --> 31:03.946
His tongue's been chewed off.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.615
His pupils are completely blown out.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.952
This guy's been coked out of his mind.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.538
He messes with 'em, jacks 'em up.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.416
They don't do what he says,
he turns him into his dogs.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.252
It's like a zombie.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.879
He's not a zombie.

31:20.004 --> 31:23.257
He's just a person
or what's left of him.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.552
There's enough drugs here
to turn anyone into an animal.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.682
Holy shit.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.685
What is this place?

31:40.316 --> 31:41.483
Okay, listen up.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.235
Here's what we're gonna do.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.613
One...

31:53.245 --> 31:55.080
Shit. What the fuck?

32:17.978 --> 32:19.980
Come here. Come on. This way.

32:20.981 --> 32:21.482
Come on!

32:21.607 --> 32:22.691
Fucked

32:25.653 --> 32:27.154
Fuckin' shit!

32:30.449 --> 32:32.117
Come on, guys!

32:32.993 --> 32:34.036
Hold there.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.329
I got a gun!

32:38.040 --> 32:39.416
What the fuck?!

32:42.002 --> 32:42.962
And, you.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.714
This asshole! Fuckin' walked us
right into that fuckin' shit!

32:46.006 --> 32:48.050
- Relax!
- My cell's worthless.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.135
I'm not getting any signal down here.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.514
We're gettin' jammed.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.183
All right, the police will be
all over this place any second.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.393
We're in a concrete tomb,

32:57.518 --> 32:58.727
1o feet underground
in a part of the city

32:59.019 --> 33:00.312
that rats won't even shit on.

33:00.396 --> 33:02.982
Nobody's gonna hear us because
there's no one around to listen.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.191
Okay?

33:04.316 --> 33:05.651
All right, let's get movin'.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.570
Stay close.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.048
Who's out there?

33:28.382 --> 33:29.717
I can hear you.

33:30.259 --> 33:34.013
Please, let me out? Please?

33:43.731 --> 33:46.108
I can... I can get you out,
but you have to be quiet. Okay?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.526
Okay.

34:15.512 --> 34:16.513
Who are you?

34:16.597 --> 34:17.639
Who are you?

34:17.723 --> 34:19.183
How did you get out?

34:19.308 --> 34:20.851
Did... did he let you out?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.145
He didn't let me out. I got out.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.572
He did this to me.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.828
I'm Elena. What's your name?

34:40.120 --> 34:41.413
Abby.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.335
Do you know your way around here?

34:46.418 --> 34:47.460
Oh, no, no, no.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.712
We can't leave this room.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.713
No, no, no.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.172
- Abby.
- We can't just go.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.800
We can get out of here, okay?

34:54.301 --> 34:55.719
Okay, come on.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.347
Come on.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.779
The footprints.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.572
Look at the spacing.

35:16.532 --> 35:17.783
Hands up!

35:19.618 --> 35:20.702
Stop.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.787
Please.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.413
Stay back!

35:23.539 --> 35:24.581
Please, help me.

35:24.706 --> 35:25.874
What the fuck is this?!

35:26.166 --> 35:28.794
Stop right there or we'll shoot!

35:32.422 --> 35:33.757
I didn't make it.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.425
I didn't make it.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.636
What didn't you make?

35:38.345 --> 35:39.847
The collection.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.602
And neither will you!

35:46.270 --> 35:47.437
Get back!

36:11.879 --> 36:13.463
Where's Arkin?

36:18.552 --> 36:21.597
Arkin? There.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.512
You don't wanna go in there.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.690
Oh...

37:55.816 --> 37:56.942
...thanks.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.777
We should keep moving.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.989
Yeah.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.660
He likes me, you know.

38:06.785 --> 38:10.038
Wait? What do you mean he likes...

38:13.000 --> 38:14.543
You'll never win.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.906
- What?
- You have a hearing aid.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.005
You're not strong enough,
you're at a disadvantage.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.577
- You can't win.
- Shh. Be quiet.

38:19.673 --> 38:20.465
You weren't even supposed to get out!

38:20.549 --> 38:21.633
- Shh.
- He's testing me!

38:21.717 --> 38:23.357
- Be quiet, okay?
- He's testing me again!

38:23.385 --> 38:24.761
- Be quiet. He's gonna hear you.
- Get away from me!

38:24.845 --> 38:26.555
Get away from me!

44:23.870 --> 44:26.122
Help me. Please.

44:27.666 --> 44:29.042
Help me.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.266
Please.

44:49.312 --> 44:50.814
Please.

44:55.735 --> 44:56.986
Help me.

45:01.741 --> 45:02.951
Please.

46:31.831 --> 46:34.417
Hey! Hey, up here!

46:34.501 --> 46:36.211
Somebody help me!

47:05.615 --> 47:07.492
You're at the bad end of good luck.

47:08.535 --> 47:10.495
I told you,
you should have cut his heels.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.780
Paz, put something right here
so he can't so he can't...

47:13.873 --> 47:15.333
Paz, give it to me.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.544
Kept you on a leash.

47:17.836 --> 47:19.212
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.005
Love this shit man.

47:22.215 --> 47:25.176
It hurts... hold his hands.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.304
- Guys up!
- Stay down, you son of a bitch.

47:28.972 --> 47:30.598
- Wally!

48:08.678 --> 48:10.513
Hey! Help me!

48:11.014 --> 48:12.390
Help me!

48:16.436 --> 48:19.564
No win. He's picking
us off one by one.

48:19.647 --> 48:21.316
If you want to live
you've got to start...

48:21.399 --> 48:23.359
...listening to me
before he takes us apart

48:23.484 --> 48:25.364
and hangs us on the wall
of his fucking gallery!

48:25.445 --> 48:26.946
We've got to work together

48:27.071 --> 48:28.281
and get the hell out of here.

48:28.406 --> 48:29.949
I am not leaving without her.

48:30.074 --> 48:33.953
If you haven't found her by now,
she's probably dead.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.915
I have been watching over her
since she was a little girl.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.416
I promised her father...

48:45.006 --> 48:46.591
I know where she is...

48:49.260 --> 48:51.220
...but you've got to get me out of here.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.569
That way.

49:11.115 --> 49:12.325
Are you sure?

49:12.450 --> 49:13.952
Mm-hmmm.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.256
No. No, no, no.

49:28.049 --> 49:31.177
It's not Elena. It's Paz.

49:44.691 --> 49:45.733
Where you goin'?

49:46.025 --> 49:47.276
Where you goin'?

49:47.360 --> 49:48.277
It's a trap.

49:48.403 --> 49:49.320
He's trying to
lure us away from Elena.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.571
You're just going to let Paz die?

49:50.655 --> 49:52.198
My objective is Elena.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.450
Dude, fuck your objective.
Can't you hear that?

49:54.534 --> 49:56.703
Don't act like you don't give a fuck.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.332
Help!

50:30.403 --> 50:33.781
Stay with her. Stay with her.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.161
Help me!

50:40.538 --> 50:43.708
Help me! Help me!

50:44.625 --> 50:46.377
In here!

50:53.134 --> 50:56.345
Wait! No! Help!

51:44.435 --> 51:47.105
Hey. Hey.

51:47.188 --> 51:49.273
Get me down.
Can you get me down?

51:50.483 --> 51:54.445
- Help, no, turn around.
- I got you. Okay?

51:54.570 --> 51:55.696
I got you. Okay?

51:58.199 --> 52:00.701
Get out of there! Come on!

52:30.481 --> 52:31.649
That way.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.235
Go. Go.

52:37.363 --> 52:38.281
- Get me out!
- Elena.

52:38.364 --> 52:39.574
Oh! Get it off!

52:39.657 --> 52:41.450
- You.
- He's coming.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.661
Get me out of this fucking thing!

52:43.744 --> 52:45.454
Get me out of this thing!

52:45.580 --> 52:46.747
Get it off!

52:47.582 --> 52:49.167
Lucello.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.211
Oh, God.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.631
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:55.715 --> 52:56.796
It's okay. Okay? It's okay.

52:56.883 --> 52:58.283
We're going to get you out of here.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.761
Okay? Let's go. I'm here.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.184
No. No, don't trust her.

53:06.309 --> 53:07.268
No. She's crazy.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.551
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
- No.

53:08.561 --> 53:09.645
Look at me.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.814
You're safe. You're safe.

53:13.900 --> 53:15.526
- We gotta go now.
- Yes.

53:15.651 --> 53:16.736
Come on. Let's go.

53:16.819 --> 53:18.362
I think I know a way out.

53:18.946 --> 53:20.698
Let's go. Come on.

53:26.746 --> 53:28.456
How many shots you got left?

53:28.581 --> 53:29.749
Two.

53:31.417 --> 53:32.919
Give me the gun.

53:33.211 --> 53:34.670
Not a chance.
We are on the third floor.

53:34.754 --> 53:36.380
I'm leading us out
the way we came in.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.507
We can't make it with
those things down there.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.302
Look, man.

53:41.385 --> 53:43.471
It's time for you to trust me.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.267
Give me the gun.

53:48.351 --> 53:49.435
If I would have wanted you dead

53:49.518 --> 53:51.646
I wouldn't have saved
your ass back there.

53:52.230 --> 53:53.522
You left me.

53:57.485 --> 54:00.363
Look, there was nothin' I could do.

54:00.446 --> 54:02.657
All right? I'm sorry.
There was nothin' I could do.

54:03.491 --> 54:06.619
I can get us out of here
if you give me the fuckin' gun.

54:21.884 --> 54:23.564
What the hell?
Did you just shoot somebody?

54:23.678 --> 54:25.554
Shots fired attracts attention.

54:26.347 --> 54:27.515
Sorry, dude.

54:27.848 --> 54:29.725
Man down attracts cops.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.270
Well played.

54:46.742 --> 54:49.912
Gunshot on the upper
right side multiple suspects.

54:57.295 --> 55:00.006
Gotta let them know
exactly where we're at.

55:06.304 --> 55:08.514
We have shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired!

55:08.597 --> 55:09.432
Need back up.

55:09.515 --> 55:12.601
1167 Tracy lane,
the old Sargento Hotel.

55:12.685 --> 55:14.645
Shots coming from the north tower.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.986
Just need to hole up
not draw attention to ourselves

55:22.111 --> 55:23.551
and wait for them to raid the joint.

55:23.612 --> 55:24.947
Sounds simple enough.

55:30.328 --> 55:31.746
What the fuck did you just do?

55:32.788 --> 55:35.708
- Oh, God.
- He likes me, you know.

55:35.791 --> 55:36.917
I told you.

55:37.918 --> 55:41.005
They're here!

55:42.590 --> 55:43.883
Shut up! Shut up!

55:44.008 --> 55:45.551
You're all gonna die!

55:45.634 --> 55:47.011
Shut the fuck up!

56:55.413 --> 56:56.497
Let's go.

56:57.498 --> 56:58.874
I can't.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.176
Oh, my God.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.892
Go. Now. Save her.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.853
We're not leaving you like this.

57:23.732 --> 57:24.817
Arkin...

57:24.900 --> 57:26.444
...bring Elena home.

57:29.572 --> 57:30.781
Go!

57:31.073 --> 57:32.491
Go, now!

57:32.992 --> 57:34.243
Go, now!

57:34.535 --> 57:36.912
- Go!
- Okay. Okay.

57:41.584 --> 57:42.751
Fuck.

57:58.476 --> 57:59.477
Team in position.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.853
Go, go, go!

58:01.770 --> 58:03.189
Red team take your six.

58:04.523 --> 58:05.774
Wait for my word.

58:08.152 --> 58:09.778
Weapons tight.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.084
What is it?

58:24.710 --> 58:27.505
No, it's a trap!

58:28.881 --> 58:29.882
Shit.

58:29.965 --> 58:31.258
I tried to tell you.

58:43.312 --> 58:44.813
Fuck you!

58:44.939 --> 58:46.524
You're him, bro.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.817
What are you doin', man?

58:51.946 --> 58:53.113
Come on! Fuck you!

58:53.197 --> 58:54.698
You piece of shit!

58:54.949 --> 58:56.534
You remember me?

58:56.617 --> 58:57.660
You remember me?

58:57.743 --> 58:59.578
Huh?

58:59.662 --> 59:01.997
Oh yeah. You remember me,
don't you?

59:05.042 --> 59:07.920
Okay. Here I am, fucker.
Fuck you! Come on!

59:08.045 --> 59:10.047
- Fuckin' cock!
- Come on inside this cage, bitch!

59:10.172 --> 59:12.925
Come on. I'd love to fuckin'
have a piece of you!

59:13.050 --> 59:14.093
Come on, man!

59:14.218 --> 59:15.678
I'll fuckin' eat your heart!

59:15.761 --> 59:17.763
I'll tear it out of your fuckin' throat!

59:17.846 --> 59:20.307
Come on! Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

59:20.599 --> 59:22.017
What kind of pussy are you?

59:22.101 --> 59:23.894
Pussy, pussy.

59:23.978 --> 59:26.313
Come here, you little pussy. Come on!

59:26.647 --> 59:28.023
- No! No!
- What are you doin'?

59:28.148 --> 59:29.191
Come and get me!

59:29.316 --> 59:30.693
What are you gonna do?

59:30.818 --> 59:31.694
You gonna kill me?

59:31.777 --> 59:33.612
You come in here and do it.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.239
- You come in here.
- No! No!

59:35.322 --> 59:38.826
- No! No!
- What are you doing?

59:38.951 --> 59:40.744
You come and do it!

59:42.997 --> 59:43.831
No!

59:43.914 --> 59:45.755
No! We gotta get out.
We gotta get... we gotta...

59:45.791 --> 59:47.793
ls there a way out? See if you can
fit your hand through.

59:47.876 --> 59:48.669
- Can you fit it through?
- Pull.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.005
- Where's the fuckin' knife?
- It slides right here.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.590
Grab the latch and pull it.

59:52.715 --> 59:54.341
- I can't do it!
- Come on. Take it out.

59:54.633 --> 59:56.353
Take it out.
I'm gonna try and get the knife

59:56.594 --> 59:57.395
Slide it towards me.

59:57.678 --> 59:58.804
Okay. Towards you.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:02.850
- Almost got it.
- I've got it! I got it, I got it!

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:04.685
No! No, no, no.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.145
Shit!

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.740
There's gotta be another way.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:18.991
There's gotta be.

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:29.001
What are you doing? Stop it.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.377
What are you doing?

01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:41.639
I need you to step on my forearm.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:44.141
I need you to re-break it.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.644
- What?
Shit... shit, shit.

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:48.270
Just do it! We don't have much time!

01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:50.856
Paz, please. Elena Somebody...

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.274
...just fuckin' do it!

01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:53.859
Do it!

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.069
Do it!

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.090
We need the fire department,
right now.

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.015
Fuck!

01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:30.479
It's working. It's working.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.731
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:01:37.111 --> 01:01:38.278
Let me reset it.

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.072
Give me your arm.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:40.989
Ready?

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:42.991
- Oh, fuck!
- We can't stay here.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.201
We gotta go.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.829
- You guys get... you guys go.
- We gotta go! Come on! Come on.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.125
All right, you're good.
Come on... let's go. Careful, careful.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:01:59.556
Drop down two floors.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.468
Don't look down. Cut the rope.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.095
Don't go all the way.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.057
- Got it?
- Yeah, go.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.436
Shit.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.416
Keep movin'.

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.130
This way.

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:42.342
Oh, my God. What...

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:58.484
No!

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.866
No!

01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:34.913
Get up, Arkin. Get up.

01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:07.446
Help us!

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.491
Help! We're in here!

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.036
We got people in there.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.009
Don't die yet! Get up.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.677
I ain't done with you!

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:36.600
Look at me.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.602
Look at me.

01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:14.554
Hurry up!

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.390
Open it!

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:18.558
Help us!

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.562
Bring in the saws.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.611
Come on! Hurry!

01:09:19.406 --> 01:09:20.782
Chief, the coroner's
stationed the bodies

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:22.367
at the south end of the parking lot.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.161
We're waiting for the final count.

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.575
We haven't seen anything
like this since the late '60s

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:46.910
and it was at those Bowery murders.

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.245
- Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:48.328 --> 01:10:49.208
Her father went crazy,

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.748
from ingesting all those
chemicals from taxidermy.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:52.999
Slaughtered his whole family

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.834
and sat them
at the Thanksgiving table.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.587
Well, not the whole family.
I believe the little boy...

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:10.535
All those insects
you're quite the collector.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:14.914
There are 200 mile radius from where
we last saw each other.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:19.502
There are 14 licensed entomologists

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.381
and you were number 12.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.509
Your daddy ran a museum, didn't he?

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.678
Fucked you up real good.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.681
Turn around.

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.733
Turn around.

01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:52.369
Are you here to kill me?

01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:58.792
No. That'd be too nice.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.546
First I'm gonna make you
feel everything that I felt

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.091
and then I'm gonna kill you.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.635
So that you can never hurt any...

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:14.474
Fuck you!

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:17.143
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:36.913
You're on his turf now.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.964
He didn't let me out. I got out.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.008
Come on! Hurry!

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.647
Daddy! Daddy!

01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:04.983
She's all I have. Find her.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.491
What the fuck?

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.578
I'm not leaving without her!

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:25.712
Damn it!

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.464
Stay down bitch.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.507
Wally!

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.561
What the fuck!

01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:51.905
Don't get any ideas.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:54.282
Go now! Go!

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:01.206
We're running out of time.

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:14.802
You're all gonna die!

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.647
Hey, Jeff. Can you take me
to your apartment?

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:37.575
What the fuck?

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.582
Get out of my way!
