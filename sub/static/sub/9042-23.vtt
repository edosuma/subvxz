01:21.267 --> 01:22.567
DON'T WORRY,
I HAVE A CHEMICAL

01:22.600 --> 01:27.500

BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET A SPOON.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.433
IS THAT GONNA UPSET YOU?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.967
- RAYMOND, HOW COULD YOU?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.100
- WHAT?

04:01.133 --> 04:03.067
- WE JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH ROBERT.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.467
- HE TOLD US ABOUT
YOUR SO-CALLED PARTY.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.300
YOU COMPLETELY LET HIM DOWN
ON HIS SPECIAL NIGHT.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.067
- WHAT?
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.167
- THEN WHY DID HE SOUND
SO DEPRESSED?

04:12.200 --> 04:16.633
- BECAUSE HE'S ROBERT.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.867
- HE TOLD ME HE SPENT
THE LAST HALF HOUR

04:18.900 --> 04:20.833
GAMBLING WITH HIS SUPER.

04:20.867 --> 04:21.733
- OH, WELL, SEE?

04:21.767 --> 04:26.200
THE PARTY KEPT GOING
EVEN AFTER I LEFT.

04:26.233 --> 04:31.033
- HE LOST HIS SECURITY DEPOSIT.

04:31.067 --> 04:34.633
- HOW IS THAT A PARTY?

04:34.667 --> 04:37.100
- LOOK, THIS IS WHAT
ROBERT WANTED.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.233
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

04:38.267 --> 04:40.400
HE SAID,
"DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL."

04:40.433 --> 04:42.467
- WELL, OF COURSE
HE SAID THAT.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.200
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS,
"DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL,"

04:44.233 --> 04:47.667
IT ALWAYS MEANS
MAKE A BIG DEAL.

04:47.700 --> 04:53.200
- NO, NO. ROBERT DOESN'T DO
THAT WOMANISH DOUBLE-TALK.

04:53.233 --> 04:55.233
- ACTUALLY,
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT

04:55.267 --> 04:57.167
A BACHELOR PARTY FOR MONTHS.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.933
- HE HAS?

04:58.967 --> 05:01.300
- YES;
HE WAS ALL EXCITED

05:01.333 --> 05:03.767

HAD IN STORE FOR HIM.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.233
I'M SORRY, RAY.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.900
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.567
I JUST THINK THAT MAYBE YOU...

05:12.600 --> 05:17.100
REALLY SCREWED UP.

05:18.567 --> 05:19.700
- OH.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.867
- RAYMOND, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER PARTY.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.067
- WHAT?

05:28.100 --> 05:31.000
- YES, AND THIS TIME, DO IT
THE WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.700
MAKE IT A BIG DEAL.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.767
- DEBRA'S RIGHT.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.500
- RAY, HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

05:35.533 --> 05:38.400
MAKE IT SOMETHING
HE'LL REMEMBER.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.600
- ARE YOU GIVING ME PERMISSION
TO GET A STRIPPER?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.000
[together]
NO.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.567
- WELL, WHAT, THEN?
WHAT ARE WE TALKIN' ABOUT?

05:48.600 --> 05:53.233
- JUST MAKE A FUN PARTY,
A BIG SHINDIG.

05:53.267 --> 05:56.667
- A "SHINDIG"?

05:56.700 --> 05:59.033
- OH, COULD HE INVITE
MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.100
- OF COURSE HE CAN.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.667
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE;
THEY HARDLY KNOW ROBERT...

06:02.700 --> 06:04.533
OR LIKE HIM.

06:04.567 --> 06:08.300
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THIS PARTY
COULD BE THE FIRST STEP

06:08.333 --> 06:11.300
IN BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER
AND ENDING THE TENSION.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.633
OOH, NOW I AM
GETTING EXCITED.

06:12.667 --> 06:13.867
- OOH, ME TOO.

06:13.900 --> 06:17.500
- LISTEN, ASK FRANK IF HE CAN
HAVE IT AT THE LODGE.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.000
- HE CAN MAKE IT
A SURPRISE PARTY.

06:19.033 --> 06:20.300
- OOH, YES.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.700
AND WHEN ROBERT COMES IN,

06:21.733 --> 06:23.933
EVERYBODY SHOULD SING
"FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW."

06:23.967 --> 06:26.700
- OH. CAN YOU IMAGINE
HIS FACE?

06:26.733 --> 06:28.933
- OH. AND I'LL TELL
HIS COUSIN GERARD

06:28.967 --> 06:30.000
TO BRING HIS ACCORDION.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.100
- I LOVE GERARD.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.333
OH, THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.000
THIS IS AS LAME AS IT GETS.

06:58.033 --> 07:01.167
- NO, RAYMOND.

07:06.900 --> 07:10.533
WHEN A PERSON BREAKS THE HEART
OF HIS ONLY BROTHER...

07:10.567 --> 07:15.733
THAT'S AS LAME AS IT GETS.

07:18.767 --> 07:19.833
- ALL RIGHT.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.000
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING MAD AT ME.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.567
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

17:24.600 --> 17:29.433
