I haven't had a chimichanga

00:47.460 --> 00:50.460
since I lost my molars
in 1988.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.460
Whoa. I wasn't even
alive in '88.

00:53.460 --> 00:54.960
Here you go.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.880

Strange weather, huh?

01:02.880 --> 01:05.380
But nothin' calms the nerves
like a nice chimi--

01:05.380 --> 01:07.580
-[rumbling]
-[both gasping]

01:07.580 --> 01:09.540
Well,
how do you like that?

01:09.540 --> 01:12.540
You know, this place
was built on a tar pit.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.380
Maybe you ought to check
that there isn't a tar geyser

01:15.380 --> 01:17.580
bubblin' in the basement.
[chuckles]

01:17.580 --> 01:20.790
-Good thinking, old chick.
-Now, wait a second.

01:20.790 --> 01:24.420
What about my...
Oh, there you are.

01:24.420 --> 01:27.500
-Glittery mad sparkle piano!
-Hi, Star!

01:27.500 --> 01:29.170
[screams]

01:30.330 --> 01:32.330
Where is she?

01:32.330 --> 01:36.500
Exploding incandescent
wrecking ball devastation!

01:39.880 --> 01:42.460
I got a... got a box
of garbage meat.

01:42.460 --> 01:44.420
Put it in the hole, Tom.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.420
[Marco]
So, if this is the magic well,

01:48.420 --> 01:50.460
it's leading to these boats
traveling here...

01:50.460 --> 01:52.040
[Star] Try another
malevolent explosion!

01:52.040 --> 01:54.170
-[splash]
-Yeah. That's it!

01:54.170 --> 01:56.750
Star, if the magic well
connects Earth and Mewni,

01:56.750 --> 02:00.170
then what if the first Mewmans
were actually humans?

02:00.170 --> 02:02.000
Marco! Less talky,
more trashy!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.670
Sparkling landfill
garbage geyser!

02:04.670 --> 02:06.620
[Oskar] Star?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.460
Hey, I didn't know you worked
at Britta's Tacos.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.790
She doesn't, you clod.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.880
Uh, so if you don't
work here,

02:14.880 --> 02:16.670
then what are you doing
in the basement?

02:16.670 --> 02:18.420
Look, Oskar,
we're kind of in

02:18.420 --> 02:20.790
an emergency-type
situation here.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.170
See, I need to get home,
and the only way home

02:23.170 --> 02:25.460
is down that well and through
a big ol' magic Slip 'N Slide

02:25.460 --> 02:27.620
that makes ya lose your mind
if you're in it too long.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.830
So I'm trying to call my
daughter, my unicorn daughter,

02:29.830 --> 02:32.670
because she stays sane
in the magic, and she can
guide us through in one piece.

02:32.670 --> 02:36.580
So we're throwing garbage
down the well to get
her attention.

02:36.580 --> 02:37.830
Garbage?

02:37.830 --> 02:40.420
Oskar, please,
try to keep up!

02:40.420 --> 02:42.420
My unicorn daughter
is a total neat freak.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.420
Don't know where
she got that from.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.790
But the garbage
we throw down the well
will bring her to us.

02:46.790 --> 02:49.580
Huh. Well, how about
the meat cooler?

02:49.580 --> 02:53.460
I bet your unicorn daughter
wouldn't be able to
ignore that big boy.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.210
[grunting]

02:59.290 --> 03:01.210
Stop throwing garbage
in here.

03:01.210 --> 03:04.920
Firstborn! Thank goodness.
You gotta listen.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.920
We need you to take us into
the well that leads to Mewni.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.500
Every time you come in here,
you sour this place.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.920
I cannot help you.
Goodbye.

03:16.710 --> 03:18.960
So...
what do we do now?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.500
Well, we don't do
anything.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.580
Looks like I gotta just
drive in there

03:23.580 --> 03:26.960
and hopefully make it
back to the Mewni well
before I lose my mind.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.500
What? No way. You're not
going in there by yourself.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.500
-We're going together, Star.
-Yeah. Together.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.420
[all screaming]

03:38.670 --> 03:41.750
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

03:43.420 --> 03:46.420
Thanks for letting us
borrow your car, Oskar!

03:46.420 --> 03:48.000
What are you doing?
You have to go.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.750
The last time
you were here,

03:49.750 --> 03:52.460
you caused a major problem
for me.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.540
Bee-oop! Okay, look,
here's the deal.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.750
You're my daughter,
so you have to do what I say.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.920
I need you to lead us through
the magic to the Mewni well.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.670
And if you don't,
do you really want four
goo-goo-brained teenagers

04:01.670 --> 04:03.920
who've lost their minds
running around down here?

04:03.920 --> 04:07.670
Yeah. That's right.
We're teenagers. We're great
at causing problems.

04:07.670 --> 04:09.620
If you want to go
back to Mewni,

04:09.620 --> 04:11.750
then I'll send you
back to Mewni.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.830
No! No, no.

04:12.830 --> 04:14.670
Don't do the zappy thing.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.380
We all have to go
back together.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.710
Now, be a good daughter unicorn
and pull us to the Mewni well.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.710
And no more complaining.

04:21.710 --> 04:24.080
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
Huh. I must be crazy.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.580
Now, I can't have
any monkey business,

04:29.580 --> 04:31.960
so just to be safe,
I'm setting the child lock.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.040
-[lock clicks]
-[scoffs] Star, give us
a little credit.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.040
Nuh-uh. I can't risk
any of you guys
getting out of the car.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.420
This place does
crazy things to your mind,

04:39.420 --> 04:41.710
and if you were to wander off,
you'd be done for, trust me.

04:41.710 --> 04:45.250
Now, come on.
Let's just sit back
and enjoy the ride.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.960
[Tom]
It is pretty cool.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.540
Hey, guys?
What are these things?

04:55.540 --> 04:57.960
Uh, that's just
a tennis b...

04:57.960 --> 04:59.500
a tennis b...

04:59.500 --> 05:01.580
Uh...

05:01.580 --> 05:03.790
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.500
Oh, boy.
It's already starting?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.710
All right, say goodbye
to your memories, people.

05:08.710 --> 05:10.580
What?
It's kicking in already?

05:10.580 --> 05:12.670
But I'm not ready!

05:12.670 --> 05:14.920
Looks like somebody
can't handle his magic.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.920
-[both chuckle]
-Newbie.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.790
Marco, my man,
sit back and relax.

05:19.790 --> 05:22.580
Just let it
wash over you.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.500
What am I doing here?

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
I didn't want this.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.290
Tom... gets what he wants.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.380
Gets to go home.

05:33.380 --> 05:36.830
Janna...
gets to be... weird.

05:38.580 --> 05:40.790
[sighs] I don't get
to have what I want.

05:40.790 --> 05:43.290
You don't even know
what you want. Yes, I do.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.170
I want, I w... I want...

05:45.170 --> 05:46.750
I want-- I want to be...

05:46.750 --> 05:49.170
to be very small.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.460
And I want you...

05:51.460 --> 05:54.670
uh, I want you to put me
in your pocket,

05:54.670 --> 05:56.710
and I want to stay there,

05:56.710 --> 05:59.170
and you can just reach in
whenever you want

05:59.170 --> 06:02.040
and just pat me on the head.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.880
-Because I love you, Star.
-What'd you just say?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.120
[laughs] What?

06:10.710 --> 06:13.580
[screams]
That guy's got three eyes!

06:13.580 --> 06:15.580
I do? [exclaims]

06:15.580 --> 06:17.710
Get it-- Get it-- Get it--
Get it off! Get it off!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.460
It's all right.
It's all right.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.040
Marco, be cool, man.
That's just...

06:22.040 --> 06:24.040
Uh, what's
your name again?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.670
Why, it's, uh...

06:25.670 --> 06:28.670
Oh, man!
I have no idea!

06:28.670 --> 06:31.620
Whoa. Cool. All guys
should have three eyes.

06:33.670 --> 06:36.290
[groans]
I want to go outside!

06:36.290 --> 06:39.880
We're not supposed to!
But I can't remember why.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.540
Maybe... we're in...
time-out.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.580
I mean, we must've done
something bad,

06:45.580 --> 06:47.670
'cause we're stuck
in this dirty, stinky place,

06:47.670 --> 06:50.790
and it is so pretty
out there!

06:50.790 --> 06:52.710
[shrieking]

06:52.710 --> 06:55.170
[all screaming]

06:55.170 --> 06:58.580
It has so many legs!
[gasps]

06:58.580 --> 07:00.170
Oh, my gosh, what if..

07:00.170 --> 07:02.750
what if that thing
is holding us prisoner?

07:02.750 --> 07:05.500
You gotta run
that thing over.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.710
-Oh, do it, do it.
-Sounds good.

07:07.710 --> 07:11.330
Oh! But I don't remember
how to make the box move.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.920
Trying... to... remember!

07:13.920 --> 07:15.330
Relax!

07:15.330 --> 07:17.330
[exclaims]

07:17.330 --> 07:20.790
[all laughing]

07:20.790 --> 07:23.960
I can't tell
if I wanna hug it
or eat it.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.580
[screams]
What is that?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.460
-[grunts]
-Watch it!

07:28.460 --> 07:30.830
[all laughing]

07:30.830 --> 07:33.460
-Do it again.
-[laughing continues]

07:33.460 --> 07:34.920
Stop this at once!

07:36.000 --> 07:37.420
We almost got it!

07:37.420 --> 07:38.920
Stop!

07:38.920 --> 07:40.790
-[all exclaim]
-Behave,

07:40.790 --> 07:44.210
or I will turn this thing
around, so help me...

07:44.210 --> 07:46.170
We have nearly reached
the Mewni well.

07:46.170 --> 07:49.380
Just sit still and...
[gasps]

07:49.380 --> 07:52.000
-[all grunt]
-Where'd she go?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.750
Maybe she's in that purple stuff
we're sitting in.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.080
Huh.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.460
I'm bored.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.080
Hey, let's go do
something fun.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.170
Oh, I love fun!

08:08.170 --> 08:10.170
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

08:10.170 --> 08:11.920
[shouts]

08:18.000 --> 08:21.710
[altered voice] Wow.
I am so sorry for that.

08:21.710 --> 08:22.880
I just blew up.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.000
I didn't even know
I could do that.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.830
Oh, boy.
I'm still on fire.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.500
There's gotta be
an "off" switch

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
somewhere here, right?

08:32.500 --> 08:33.880
Let's go play.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.960
[all grunting]

08:35.960 --> 08:37.830
Let me go!

08:37.830 --> 08:40.250
-[gasps]
-Oh, hello.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.000
Hey, could you
help us?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.040
We don't know how to
get out of these things,

08:44.040 --> 08:45.790
and he's on fire.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.580
I can't figure it out.

08:47.580 --> 08:50.170
[gasps] The Mewni...
The Mewni Well...

08:50.170 --> 08:51.920
is just ahead!

08:54.210 --> 08:55.880
[gasping]

08:55.880 --> 08:57.790
Go. Go now,
before he gets--

09:01.170 --> 09:02.830
[all grunting]

09:06.040 --> 09:09.540
Oh! The button makes
the rope-y thing let go!

09:09.540 --> 09:12.670
-[laughing, exclaiming]
-Hey, guys, wait for me!

09:13.880 --> 09:15.880
Hey, guys, wait for me!

09:15.880 --> 09:19.500
[both laughing] Whee!

09:19.500 --> 09:21.290
You're fun.

09:21.290 --> 09:24.080
[chuckles]
You're fun too.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.000
[together]
I like you.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.670
[high-pitched voice]
Excuse me.

09:27.670 --> 09:31.460
I'm lost.
Have you seen my family?

09:31.460 --> 09:33.880
I don't know
where they went.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.080
No. I'm sorry.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.170
But maybe...

09:38.170 --> 09:40.960
we can be your family.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.250
I'd like that.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.250
[giggles] Okay!

09:47.250 --> 09:50.290
Aw! I love
our little family!

09:50.290 --> 09:52.210
Mama, I'm hungry.

09:52.210 --> 09:53.960
Well, eat up, champ.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.120
You need to grow up
big and strong.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.920
[chuckles]

10:00.920 --> 10:03.290
Whoa!

10:05.330 --> 10:07.750
-High five.
-[snarling]

10:15.120 --> 10:16.960
Aw!

10:18.170 --> 10:20.960
Whew!
It is hot in here.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.080
I'm... so happy.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.330
Can we have
a thousand babies?

10:29.120 --> 10:31.620
You can have those,
but this one's mine.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.460
[snarling]

10:33.460 --> 10:36.620
Come here! Mm!

11:05.580 --> 11:08.170

[snarling]
