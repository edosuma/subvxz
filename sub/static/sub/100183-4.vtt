WEBVTT

00:00.194 --> 00:01.986
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:01.988 --> 00:04.827
The Markovians are on
the outskirts of Freeland,

00:04.830 --> 00:07.297
and they are marshalling their forces.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.946
If you help me with this...

00:08.949 --> 00:09.994
Whoa.

00:09.997 --> 00:11.177
...you can go home.

00:13.220 --> 00:14.529
_

00:16.644 --> 00:18.250
How close are you to finding a cure?

00:18.252 --> 00:19.296
I'm making progress.

00:19.299 --> 00:22.069
These people are depending
upon you to save their lives.

00:22.072 --> 00:24.606
- You need to fix this.
- I know.

00:24.609 --> 00:25.830
What is your function?

00:25.832 --> 00:27.759
I'm a biological weapon system.

00:30.046 --> 00:32.110
I picked this up a few moments ago.

00:32.113 --> 00:33.367
That's Grace.

00:35.205 --> 00:38.906
So, if you're trying to find
somebody who doesn't want to be found,

00:38.909 --> 00:40.439
how do you go about that?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.669
Depends on the person.

00:41.672 --> 00:42.988
Grace?

00:42.991 --> 00:44.499
I missed you.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.791
I missed you, too.

00:49.606 --> 00:51.100
Damn.

00:51.103 --> 00:53.047
I'm Jamillah Olsen, and
I'm here at the perimeter

00:53.050 --> 00:55.179
where ASA commandos
have Blackbird cornered

00:55.182 --> 00:58.023
in response to reports that she
freed several suspected metas

00:58.026 --> 00:59.859
from the ASA.

00:59.862 --> 01:01.821
The Markovians want to capture

01:01.824 --> 01:04.074
or kill as many metas as possible.

01:04.077 --> 01:05.186
What do you want me to do?

01:05.188 --> 01:07.614
Your target is the data farm up ahead.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.460
- I found it.
- Now take it out.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.843 --> 01:29.884
Lab log, day six.

01:29.887 --> 01:31.387
Fatalities from the meta virus

01:31.390 --> 01:33.374
with Ebola properties continue to grow.

01:34.543 --> 01:36.760
As the foremost medical
expert on meta-humans,

01:36.763 --> 01:40.315
people are counting
on me, and I'm failing.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.493
I'm failing,

01:44.353 --> 01:46.044
and I'm so tired.

01:52.219 --> 01:55.512
All I know is, the chemical
structure of the meta virus

01:55.515 --> 01:57.941
is similar to a chemical
compound found in both...

01:57.944 --> 02:00.353
...Green Light and the meta vaccine.

02:00.355 --> 02:04.056
Call it fatigue, but I
find myself staring at

02:04.058 --> 02:06.451
the Green Light, wanting
to ask it questions.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.984
Then something occurred to me.

02:09.987 --> 02:13.231
Without exception, Green Light
patients have shown a notable boost

02:13.234 --> 02:15.025
in brain activity.

02:15.027 --> 02:16.373
So in theory, if I was able

02:16.376 --> 02:18.862
to remove the drug's
psychoactive addictive properties,

02:18.865 --> 02:20.573
rendering it safe for consumption,

02:20.575 --> 02:22.926
I could literally make myself smarter.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.082
I used a technique on Green Light

02:30.084 --> 02:32.867
similar to what's used to
extract THC from marijuana.

02:33.555 --> 02:35.480
I tested it on myself

02:35.482 --> 02:39.234
in microdoses, but the
results left no doubt,

02:39.236 --> 02:42.720
a significant increase in
focus, plus exponential gains

02:42.722 --> 02:45.125
in my ability to process information.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.412
It's working.

02:51.414 --> 02:53.498
So I am working around the clock

02:53.501 --> 02:55.941
because if I can't
contain this outbreak,

02:55.943 --> 02:59.254
every single meta,
including my entire family,

02:59.256 --> 03:00.338
could die.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.000
What's all this?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.270
Checkpoint.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.505
Not a big deal.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.599
Lots of changes while you were away.

04:01.601 --> 04:02.775
Looks like a war zone.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.344
Pretty much.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.656
Here you go. And don't worry,

04:08.658 --> 04:10.450
Odell has us registered as non-metas.

04:27.493 --> 04:29.118
- Dad.
- Move. Find cover.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.800
- Put the gun down.
- Get down!

04:33.105 --> 04:34.748
Either of you move, and I will end you.

04:43.676 --> 04:46.198
Hey, hey, hey. You're overreacting.

04:55.616 --> 04:56.758
On the ground now.

05:02.236 --> 05:03.776
You okay?

05:03.779 --> 05:05.505
Yeah. You?

05:08.576 --> 05:10.122
Welcome to the occupation.

05:15.041 --> 05:20.290
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:22.590 --> 05:24.357
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:32.725 --> 05:34.317
Ready?

05:34.319 --> 05:36.079
On three, two, one...

05:39.899 --> 05:42.941
Assuming Odell has a tracking
device embedded in the new suit,

05:42.943 --> 05:46.111
that will duplicate the signal,
buy me some time to disable it.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.780
This is a mobile Faraday cage.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.063
It will block any signal
coming from the watch.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.454
I gotta tell you, this cloaking thing

05:55.456 --> 05:58.049
- is gonna take some getting used to.
- Yeah.

05:58.051 --> 05:59.575
It's not easy being dead.

05:59.577 --> 06:02.127
I gotta stay that way until
I know who tried to kill me.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.754
How about you? How are you feeling?

06:03.756 --> 06:05.964
Any residual effects
from the ASA testing?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.459
No, actually, I'm good.

06:08.945 --> 06:11.571
Wish I could say the
same for my marriage.

06:11.573 --> 06:14.932
Butting heads over how
to deal with the ASA.

06:14.934 --> 06:18.560
You know, I couldn't wait to leave
the Pit. Lynn is going voluntarily,

06:18.562 --> 06:21.939
even though they're blindfolding
her and driving her in and out.

06:21.941 --> 06:23.624
That's painful,

06:23.626 --> 06:25.619
not being on the same
page with your wife.

06:28.114 --> 06:30.572
Is that what happened
with you and your ex?

06:30.574 --> 06:32.783
Job got in the way?

06:32.785 --> 06:36.837
That's ancient history.
Let's not turn those pages.

06:36.839 --> 06:38.062
I'll check out your suit,

06:38.065 --> 06:41.166
set up a tracking
system to find the Pit.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.760
You figure out how to get back
on the same page with Lynn.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.561
Got your text.

06:53.806 --> 06:55.848
Still checking in on me, huh?

06:55.850 --> 06:59.810
In a manner of speaking, yes. Now
that your father has returned home,

06:59.812 --> 07:02.813
especially under such
trying circumstances,

07:02.815 --> 07:04.901
it's important that

07:04.904 --> 07:07.326
we keep this line of communication open.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.543
Can I ask you a question, like for real?

07:09.546 --> 07:11.330
As the head honcho
in charge around here,

07:11.332 --> 07:13.499
why don't you just put
an end to this occupation?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.868
Because the Markovians killed my people.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.202
That's not a reason to start snatching

07:17.204 --> 07:18.572
people up and locking them in camps.

07:18.574 --> 07:20.706
We put people with
the meta gene in camps

07:20.708 --> 07:21.849
to keep them alive,

07:21.851 --> 07:24.042
the Markovians put people in camps

07:24.044 --> 07:25.836
to watch them die.

07:25.838 --> 07:27.880
How do I even know that's true?

07:27.882 --> 07:29.506
Every search engine gets blocked by

07:29.508 --> 07:31.150
all your stupid Internet restrictions.

07:31.152 --> 07:32.801
I could send you a link, Ms. Pierce,

07:32.804 --> 07:34.553
encrypted, of course.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.237
Then you can see exactly
what it is we're up against.

07:39.035 --> 07:41.560
I still don't understand why
you have to lock the city down.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.270
Ever heard of Rwanda?

07:43.272 --> 07:45.124
The former Yugoslavia?

07:45.127 --> 07:46.457
Liberia?

07:48.035 --> 07:52.362
Things can go to chaos real
quick with the wrong push,

07:52.364 --> 07:55.174
and chaos is deadly.

07:58.704 --> 08:00.012
Good day, Ms. Pierce.

08:15.554 --> 08:18.120
Let's open this bitch up and
see what y'all brought me now.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.897
Damn!

08:26.899 --> 08:28.838
Shut that and pick
this fool's dumb ass up.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.252
Leave dude in there.

08:31.254 --> 08:32.879
He'll bleed out when we roll.

08:49.629 --> 08:53.231
This is Jamillah Olsen reporting
from inside occupied Freeland.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.758
Today, I'm at Garfield High School,

08:54.760 --> 08:55.968
where students are being tested

08:55.970 --> 08:59.152
for ASA-mandated registration cards.

08:59.155 --> 09:00.873
Only those who test negative for the

09:00.876 --> 09:02.974
meta gene can move
freely about the city.

09:02.977 --> 09:06.603
Those who test positive will be
taken to an ASA detainment facility

09:06.605 --> 09:09.106
and forced to submit
to medical procedures.

09:09.108 --> 09:10.482
Yo.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.084
'Sup, man?

09:12.086 --> 09:13.936
- You're getting in line, right?
- Nah.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.247
I already got mine. I'll catch up
with you later though, all right?

09:16.249 --> 09:17.331
Yeah, all right.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.782
All right.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.221
- What's good?
- Hey.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.719
Another one of my
trucks has been hijacked.

09:30.721 --> 09:36.008
Find the vermin who keep stealing
from me and exterminate them.

09:47.021 --> 09:50.814
To think, once upon a time, I
was worried about metal detectors.

09:50.816 --> 09:52.668
It's not about corner boys now.

09:52.671 --> 09:54.380
If a war breaks out,
we're gonna be really happy

09:54.382 --> 09:57.675
- the ASA is here.
- Wait, what? Jen.

09:57.678 --> 10:00.508
Jen, you saw what happened
at that checkpoint.

10:00.510 --> 10:03.535
- They pointed guns at us.
- Didn't you just let the ASA experiment on you?

10:03.537 --> 10:05.296
'Cause I'm pretty sure you did.

10:05.298 --> 10:08.165
Why would you do that if you
thought the ASA was no good, Dad?

10:08.167 --> 10:09.207
To protect you.

10:11.095 --> 10:12.728
That's always the reason, isn't it?

10:22.939 --> 10:24.722
Morning, gentlemen.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.059
- Mr. Pierce.
- Mind if I have a look?

10:27.061 --> 10:29.829
Yeah, just looking at a video of...

10:31.231 --> 10:33.782
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:33.784 --> 10:36.335
I'm sorry. It's pretty cool, though.

10:37.746 --> 10:38.921
Yeah.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.926
Yeah.

10:44.962 --> 10:46.387
Thank you.

10:48.207 --> 10:49.797
Have a good class.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.751
Mr. Pierce, a word?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.544
Yeah, actually, I have to get to class.

10:54.546 --> 10:55.771
Yes, about that.

10:55.773 --> 10:57.756
During your ASA-approved medical leave,

10:57.758 --> 10:59.879
Mrs. Wellen was permanently
assigned your classes.

11:00.886 --> 11:04.041
- You can't do that.
- I didn't. The ASA did.

11:06.558 --> 11:09.601
After 30 days of being poked and prodded

11:09.603 --> 11:11.728
and taking every test under the sun,

11:11.730 --> 11:13.480
- this is the thanks I get?
- Oh, I'm not finished.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.273
You've been made our
new guidance counselor.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.388
Congrats.

11:16.391 --> 11:19.502
Now what I find most puzzling,
as part of this demotion,

11:19.505 --> 11:21.905
the ASA also gave you
a raise, a nicer office,

11:21.907 --> 11:23.740
and a lot less work.

11:23.742 --> 11:27.493
Based on that, I'm gonna
assume you must have done...

11:27.496 --> 11:29.857
really well on those tests.

11:36.254 --> 11:38.921
That's all you can tell me?

11:38.924 --> 11:41.233
At some point, death comes for us all.

11:42.052 --> 11:44.469
And when that time comes,

11:44.471 --> 11:47.764
though we yearn for love,
all we're left with is pain.

11:47.766 --> 11:49.975
A person will do more to avoid pain

11:49.977 --> 11:52.811
than to achieve anything
else in this world.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.714
Knowing this, the greatest
gift that anyone could ever give

11:57.651 --> 11:59.210
is to take that pain away.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.423
Lucky for you,

12:06.043 --> 12:07.385
they call me Painkiller.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.842
I assume this is important.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.278
You told me measures were being taken

12:26.280 --> 12:29.139
to ensure Freeland's safety, okay.

12:29.141 --> 12:31.516
You never said anything
about martial law.

12:31.518 --> 12:35.020
Markovians attacked an ASA operation

12:35.022 --> 12:36.521
and killed my personnel.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.483
You'd rather I sent a
strongly worded email?

12:39.485 --> 12:43.796
When I see military walking around
the hallways of my high school...

12:44.698 --> 12:46.465
Things have to change.

12:46.467 --> 12:49.201
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.536
Keep troops in Freeland, fine.

12:51.538 --> 12:55.040
But this occupation is overkill.

12:55.042 --> 12:58.227
In my experience, Mr.
Pierce, there's no such thing.

12:59.379 --> 13:03.048
Now you continue to do as instructed,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.592
or I'll put your daughters in the Pit.

13:05.594 --> 13:08.053
Run tests on them,

13:08.055 --> 13:10.698
just like all the others.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.209
I spent my whole life trying
to make these damn streets safe,

13:39.211 --> 13:41.086
and they got me out there
talking like I'm some...

13:41.088 --> 13:43.255
Talking as the chief of police.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.256
Yes.

13:47.761 --> 13:51.096
I know you're frustrated,
but when all this ends,

13:51.098 --> 13:53.190
you'll be the man who
got Freeland through this.

13:53.192 --> 13:55.642
You'll have the clout
to fix the department,

13:55.644 --> 13:56.935
be mayor someday.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.913
- I don't know, Veretta.
- I do.

13:58.915 --> 14:01.106
You be who you gotta be today,

14:01.108 --> 14:03.200
so you can be who you
want to be tomorrow.

14:03.202 --> 14:06.045
Mmm-hmm.

14:06.047 --> 14:07.379
Hmm.

14:19.493 --> 14:22.311
- Major.
- The ASA is commandeering this station.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.548
Escort these prisoners to lockup.

14:26.550 --> 14:30.093
Agent Odell assured me this station
will remain under my command.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.679
Now I have orders that say otherwise.

14:32.681 --> 14:35.432
Until further notice, this
location is a clean camp

14:35.434 --> 14:38.810
to keep suspected metas as far away
from the meta virus as possible.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.562
How the hell we supposed
to do our job, huh?

14:40.564 --> 14:41.980
What...

14:41.982 --> 14:43.256
What you expect us to do?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.442
You can start by
clearing out your office.

14:45.444 --> 14:48.504
I'll be using it for
the duration. And...

14:48.506 --> 14:50.589
as always, Chief Henderson,

14:51.950 --> 14:54.260
we appreciate your cooperation.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.179
Mmm-hmm.

14:59.947 --> 15:01.141
Hmm.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.235
All right, stop that vehicle.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.815
_

15:30.320 --> 15:33.156
The Markovian government continues

15:33.158 --> 15:36.076
their reign of terror with
their strategic assault...

15:36.078 --> 15:41.089
on Sudan, stripping them of resources,
killing with extreme prejudice,

15:41.091 --> 15:45.093
women, children, and
non-military personnel.

15:45.095 --> 15:48.046
While the United Nations
condemned their actions,

15:48.048 --> 15:51.341
currently no aid has been allowed entry.

15:51.343 --> 15:54.653
This is a very violent
and incendiary situation.

16:03.781 --> 16:08.400
Closest thing I ever had to
powers was driving the city bus.

16:08.402 --> 16:11.619
The job I started one
month before I got married,

16:11.622 --> 16:13.505
38 years ago.

16:14.216 --> 16:16.883
38 years of marriage?

16:16.886 --> 16:19.869
Now that is a superpower.

16:19.871 --> 16:22.914
Well, hopefully this
will slow the virus down,

16:22.916 --> 16:25.434
giving us enough time to
come up with a vaccine.

16:25.436 --> 16:26.852
Get you home to your wife.

16:28.296 --> 16:29.879
You have any kids?

16:29.881 --> 16:31.190
Three of them.

16:31.192 --> 16:33.025
Two boys and a girl.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.486
Plus grandkids.

16:36.930 --> 16:40.432
My youngest one, my daughter Olivia,

16:40.434 --> 16:43.560
she's set to get
married in a few months.

16:43.562 --> 16:46.664
I even like the fella, not
that I'll ever admit it.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.943
Sorry.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.338
None of this seems real.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.282
I still can't believe I'm dying.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.551
Hey, don't give up on me, okay?

17:00.596 --> 17:02.262
'Cause I'm not giving up on you.

17:28.207 --> 17:30.315
I'll pay the three stacks this time.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.085
But when we're talking the
same weapons at twice the price,

17:33.087 --> 17:35.945
- that mess ain't gonna fly.
- It's supply and demand,

17:35.948 --> 17:37.183
and I got the supply.

17:40.870 --> 17:43.620
If you don't drive off,
you won't have anything.

17:43.622 --> 17:44.957
I ain't got no beef with you.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.969
Then I suggest you leave.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.018
You can't be using my name

17:58.020 --> 18:00.845
and symbol, and then you go
off shooting up ASA checkpoints.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.147
I don't take orders from you.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.640
Your boss did not approve of that.

18:03.642 --> 18:05.670
Now you lucky the result
was just getting locked up.

18:05.672 --> 18:06.935
They could've been killed.

18:06.937 --> 18:08.645
By any means necessary.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.205
Don't go quoting Malcolm to me.

18:10.207 --> 18:13.149
You don't like the way we
doing things, talk to the boss.

18:13.151 --> 18:15.006
Oh, I plan to.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.250
I'm sorry, uh...

18:30.252 --> 18:32.763
I thought this was
Anissa Pierce's place.

18:32.766 --> 18:35.719
It is, Mr. Pierce, I'm Grace.

18:35.722 --> 18:37.936
I recognize you from her photos.

18:38.811 --> 18:40.069
Nice to finally meet you.

18:41.197 --> 18:43.221
Please come in.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.339
Thank you.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.950
I am not really sure
when she'll be back,

18:54.952 --> 18:56.899
but shouldn't be too long.

18:57.955 --> 18:59.275
Can I get you something to drink?

19:00.357 --> 19:01.573
Uh, no.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.008
I'm fine, thank you.

19:16.890 --> 19:17.973
What, Dad?

19:17.975 --> 19:19.122
Hey, what's up?

19:21.178 --> 19:23.569
Wait, she knows?

19:23.572 --> 19:24.863
About Blackbird?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.308
A person I've never met?

19:28.310 --> 19:30.579
Look, she only knows about me, I swear.

19:30.582 --> 19:31.810
Thunder too?

19:33.098 --> 19:34.273
Yeah.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.484
You have put our
entire family in danger.

19:38.486 --> 19:40.036
Dad, I trust Grace with my life.

19:40.039 --> 19:42.629
Oh, until you throw her out of
your bed and find someone else.

19:42.632 --> 19:44.383
Okay, I don't know where
any of this is coming from,

19:44.385 --> 19:45.617
but I'm not gonna stand here

19:45.619 --> 19:47.785
and be yelled at by you or anyone else.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.120
Why, 'cause you're Blackbird now?

19:49.122 --> 19:51.623
Running around, showing off?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.517
Throwing tanks?

19:56.087 --> 19:58.630
Helping people has never
been enough for you.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.965
No. No, you, you gotta be famous,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.800
live in a fancy loft.

20:02.802 --> 20:06.137
Paid with drug money, I take it.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.599
Running around spraying that
ridiculous logo all over town.

20:09.601 --> 20:10.975
So, what, are you jealous?

20:10.977 --> 20:13.102
And that logo? That's not even me.

20:13.104 --> 20:16.064
That's the insurgents
using me to inspire hope.

20:16.066 --> 20:18.292
You know, something Black
Lightning used to do.

20:18.294 --> 20:23.279
Do you have any idea, any idea
what I've been through for the city?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.122
Don't hurt us.

20:33.124 --> 20:34.666
- Hey. Hey, Grace.
- Please don't.

20:34.668 --> 20:38.437
It's okay. He's not
gonna hurt you or me.

20:38.439 --> 20:39.591
I promise.

20:44.135 --> 20:46.009
What the hell was that?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.487
You need to leave.

20:48.244 --> 20:49.347
Now.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.399
- Anissa...
- Dad, no, listen to me.

20:51.401 --> 20:53.017
This is my house.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.814
And right now, you're not welcome in it.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.627
Leave.

21:21.690 --> 21:22.981
Can I sit down?

21:34.536 --> 21:38.563
I need you to know that
my dad would never hurt me.

21:38.565 --> 21:43.234
He's overbearing, and he has had
a hard time seeing me as an adult.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.736
But he's no threat

21:44.738 --> 21:46.171
to me or to you.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.507
Okay?

21:49.575 --> 21:51.842
I never wanted you to see this.

21:51.845 --> 21:52.970
Not ever.

21:54.006 --> 21:55.473
Not this piece of me.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.755
There's still so much you don't know.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.021
Maybe less than you think.

22:04.230 --> 22:05.556
Shay Li Wylde.

22:14.776 --> 22:16.692
How do you know that name?

22:16.695 --> 22:18.728
My Uncle Gambi.

22:18.730 --> 22:21.606
He has access to things
that most people don't.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.542
I know about you losing your parents...

22:24.778 --> 22:26.837
and you living on the streets.

22:26.839 --> 22:28.237
How you were kidnapped...

22:28.239 --> 22:30.479
And sold for sex against my will.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.454
I told you I was broken.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.258
I can't believe you'd want to
be with me knowing all that.

22:39.261 --> 22:40.559
Well...

22:41.628 --> 22:42.761
Believe it.

22:42.763 --> 22:44.962
Anissa, this would be a lot for anybody.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.348
Grace, I told you, we're in this.

22:47.351 --> 22:49.467
Me, you, the leopard,

22:49.469 --> 22:50.927
that old guy, all of us.

22:50.929 --> 22:52.863
It's one big party up in here.

22:54.808 --> 22:58.358
It is not your beautiful face

22:58.361 --> 23:01.337
or this fine-ass body
that I'm in love with.

23:01.340 --> 23:03.648
Now, don't get me wrong,
if we taking votes,

23:03.650 --> 23:06.062
this form is by far my favorite.

23:09.373 --> 23:11.141
But it's not even about that.

23:13.284 --> 23:14.593
It's you, Grace.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.428
Your heart.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.403
Your soul.

23:19.406 --> 23:20.856
Your essence.

23:22.636 --> 23:24.061
That's what I'm in love with.

23:26.339 --> 23:27.606
Just you.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.743
It's okay.

23:48.263 --> 23:49.556
Hey.

23:50.757 --> 23:51.922
Hey.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.371
Wow, I haven't seen you look
this bad since med school.

23:58.588 --> 24:00.872
That's exactly the warm
welcome I was hoping for.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.475
Ah, no, sweetheart, that's
not what I meant, you just...

24:05.187 --> 24:07.795
You look really, really tired.

24:07.797 --> 24:09.431
You want me to run you a bath?

24:09.433 --> 24:11.883
No, no, I'm just here for a
few minutes to grab some things.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.111
I have to get back. I'm
synthesizing a vaccine.

24:15.106 --> 24:16.279
What?

24:20.527 --> 24:23.758
Wait, what? You're gonna
stay there again tonight?

24:24.856 --> 24:26.832
But, babe, we need to talk.

24:29.694 --> 24:30.836
I have to get back.

24:30.838 --> 24:32.904
Okay, look, I...

24:32.906 --> 24:38.117
I just think that... we
need to get on the same page.

24:38.119 --> 24:39.803
Look, our girls need us.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.432
Anissa is trippin' big time,

24:43.434 --> 24:47.185
and Jennifer seems to think
that the ASA occupation

24:47.187 --> 24:48.544
is actually a good thing.

24:52.317 --> 24:53.358
Lynn?

24:59.724 --> 25:01.158
Jeff, are the girls safe?

25:01.818 --> 25:03.034
Wait, what?

25:04.913 --> 25:07.104
Yeah, for now, I guess.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.447
Anything that comes up,
you can take care of it.

25:09.450 --> 25:10.658
I need to get back.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.273
Again with the tuna breath.

25:24.415 --> 25:26.016
Like your salami's any better.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.334
Of the six ASA trucks that were taken,

25:36.636 --> 25:38.361
four of them link
back to the two of you.

25:39.856 --> 25:41.472
No...

25:41.474 --> 25:43.539
When I want you to speak,
I'll ask you a question.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.470
That pain that you're
feeling? It's neurotoxins

25:47.473 --> 25:50.248
that I can administer at
varying levels of intensity.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.816
This was a small dose.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.151
Now, the longer that this process takes,

25:54.153 --> 25:55.987
the higher that dosage will become.

25:55.989 --> 26:00.592
Until you fall into paralysis
and ultimately death.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.268
So, shall we begin?

26:05.623 --> 26:07.265
It's this drug dealer, Sinzell.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.550
He pays us for the supply routes.

26:08.552 --> 26:10.126
He's got a warehouse
somewhere north of here,

26:10.128 --> 26:12.336
- we're not sure where.
- That's all we know.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.444
I swear.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.984
Listen, if any of this
information isn't good,

26:17.986 --> 26:19.727
I'll find you two weak-minded cowards,

26:19.729 --> 26:20.879
and I will torture you

26:20.881 --> 26:22.441
every day for a year before I kill you.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.285
It's good, I promise.

26:32.682 --> 26:34.116
Did I ask you a question?

27:01.071 --> 27:03.104
People always talk about Nazi Germany...

27:03.106 --> 27:04.055
And for good reason.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.223
Obviously, but look at us.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.411
In World War II,

27:07.412 --> 27:10.394
we put anyone who even looked
Japanese in a prison camp.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.689
Not to mention occupying
the Philippines, Haiti...

27:13.691 --> 27:15.399
Dominican Republic, Iraq.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.151
There's more to the world than the US.

27:17.153 --> 27:18.819
What about the Russian
occupation of Ukraine?

27:18.821 --> 27:20.154
Or Turkey being in Syria?

27:20.156 --> 27:21.697
These are all happening right now.

27:21.699 --> 27:24.075
- Today.
- Yes, but unless it's on TMZ,

27:24.077 --> 27:26.396
or a Kardashian tattoos it on they ass,

27:26.399 --> 27:28.704
nobody seems to care.

27:28.706 --> 27:31.415
What none of you are
talking about is genocide.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.686
The government coming in as
peacekeepers trying to help.

27:33.689 --> 27:35.294
I mean, Rwanda, Darfur.

27:35.296 --> 27:38.525
Peacekeeping in Rwanda failed.
Like seriously, it failed...

27:38.528 --> 27:39.353
- Look...
- Done.

27:39.356 --> 27:41.989
My point is, maybe this
occupation isn't all bad.

27:41.992 --> 27:44.761
Maybe the ASA's here trying to
protect the people of Freeland.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.247
All right, all right.

27:46.249 --> 27:49.242
Hold up, excuse me. You
have no right to do this,

27:49.244 --> 27:51.018
do you hear me? You have no right.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.154
Tavon Singley, I'm gonna
need you to come with us.

27:53.156 --> 27:54.264
What'd I do?

27:54.267 --> 27:56.273
- I ain't do nothing.
- No, Tavon, you stay right there,

27:56.275 --> 27:58.024
- you are not going anywhere.
- Whoa, whoa.

27:58.027 --> 27:59.366
Sir, you need to step aside.

27:59.369 --> 28:01.612
There's been a report of
meta-human powers being displayed.

28:01.614 --> 28:03.720
What? No, that's not true.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.166
- That's not true!
- Listen, you get your hands...

28:07.220 --> 28:09.180
Let's go.

28:10.807 --> 28:12.415
Wait, Tavon.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.843
Wait...

28:15.845 --> 28:17.765
What do you think of
your peacekeepers now?

28:30.941 --> 28:32.860
So they're just gonna lock him up

28:32.862 --> 28:34.103
and wait till the results come in?

28:34.105 --> 28:35.746
There's no way in hell Tavon's a meta.

28:35.749 --> 28:38.249
I heard someone dropped a "see
something, say something" dime on him.

28:38.251 --> 28:40.818
Got some beef over a girl.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.037
You really believe
that peacekeeping stuff

28:43.039 --> 28:45.448
- about the ASA helping?
- Look, I don't know.

28:45.450 --> 28:46.345
Okay?

28:46.348 --> 28:48.908
But what I do know is,
Markovia's dangerous.

28:48.911 --> 28:50.995
I've been hearing some
crazy stuff about them,

28:50.997 --> 28:53.640
like war-crime stuff.

28:53.642 --> 28:55.028
That's dumb as hell.

28:55.031 --> 28:58.084
How could you judge an entire
country based off of rumors?

28:59.140 --> 29:01.106
Y'all don't even know what the
hell y'all talking about, man.

29:01.108 --> 29:03.007
- Oh, and you do?
- I'm just saying.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.426
History is written by whoever wins.

29:05.428 --> 29:08.757
So unless we experience
things firsthand,

29:08.760 --> 29:10.354
how do we know it's true?

29:14.020 --> 29:17.646
Well, if it was up to my mom, I
would never experience anything.

29:17.648 --> 29:22.085
I really hate how they say that
they want us to be better than them.

29:22.087 --> 29:23.962
'Cause in reality, they never do.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.589
That's real.

29:31.287 --> 29:32.971
It's okay, Doc.

29:34.090 --> 29:35.473
You did what you could.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.893
Richard, stay with me, okay?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.061
Richard...

30:16.895 --> 30:18.302
It looks like you're gonna be

30:18.305 --> 30:20.786
able to walk your daughter
down the aisle after all.

30:26.568 --> 30:28.153
Hey, hey, where's the watch?

30:28.156 --> 30:29.593
Come here for a sec,
I wanna show you this.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.354
I was able to put a radioactive resin

30:31.356 --> 30:33.531
on the tires of several ASA vehicles.

30:33.533 --> 30:36.225
This will allow us to track
their frequently traveled routes,

30:36.227 --> 30:38.102
narrowing down the list of locations

30:38.104 --> 30:39.895
until they lead us to the Pit.

30:39.897 --> 30:40.705
That's great.

30:41.374 --> 30:42.332
That's great.

30:43.776 --> 30:44.751
The watch.

30:45.736 --> 30:46.869
What's the urgency?

30:46.871 --> 30:49.113
The ASA snatched a student, Tavon,

30:49.115 --> 30:50.781
right out of Jennifer's classroom,

30:50.783 --> 30:52.750
then beat down the principal
when he tried to stop them.

30:52.752 --> 30:55.553
I heard from Henderson the ASA is
holding Tavon at the police station.

30:57.173 --> 30:58.181
Ah.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.418
Did you try the tracking device?

31:03.421 --> 31:05.480
I did, disabled it.

31:05.482 --> 31:07.965
Oh, great.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.301
I wish I could say otherwise,
but that suit's far better

31:10.303 --> 31:11.802
than anything I've ever built.

31:11.804 --> 31:13.637
I could've done the
same with $30 billion

31:13.639 --> 31:15.573
and ten guys working
around the clock, but...

31:16.475 --> 31:18.475
It's got next-gen nanotech,

31:18.477 --> 31:20.477
and with its increased
conductivity threshold,

31:20.479 --> 31:23.957
you can generate 20 to 30% more
electricity without any risk

31:23.959 --> 31:25.816
of damaging your nervous system.

31:25.818 --> 31:26.918
The thing's amazing.

31:27.653 --> 31:28.795
Good.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.659
Jeff.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.119
What about your family?

31:37.121 --> 31:38.805
Odell was very clear,

31:38.807 --> 31:41.933
you go out on the street,
they go in the Pit.

31:41.935 --> 31:43.125
Wait...

31:44.387 --> 31:45.950
Maybe there's a better way.

31:49.045 --> 31:50.979
But I'm gonna need a little help.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.400
Dad, not right now.
I need to get to work.

32:00.403 --> 32:02.686
Whatever you have to say
to me can wait until later.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:03.981 --> 32:05.415
Look, just hear me out.

32:05.418 --> 32:08.025
Now, I know I'm not your
favorite person at the moment,

32:08.027 --> 32:09.693
and I'm not saying I agree
with all your choices.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.905
- I'm not asking you to.
- Oh, look, look.

32:12.907 --> 32:14.966
Just, look...

32:16.369 --> 32:20.162
You and I, we disagree, okay?

32:20.164 --> 32:22.423
On a lot of things.

32:22.425 --> 32:24.708
But I know that you care
about the people of Freeland.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.436
You don't even know the half of it.

32:31.509 --> 32:32.841
Okay, look...

32:32.843 --> 32:35.886
me, Reverend Holt, and a
handful of other people,

32:35.888 --> 32:38.055
we started up our own
underground railroad.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.516
We've been sneaking
metas and suspected metas

32:40.518 --> 32:41.659
outside the perimeter.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.562
How did you get them...

32:45.564 --> 32:46.844
With an assist from Uncle Gambi.

32:50.211 --> 32:52.795
All these years calling
you Harriet Tubman

32:53.531 --> 32:54.655
were prophetic.

32:55.508 --> 32:57.074
Okay, Dad, stop, please.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.217
No, uh...

32:59.337 --> 33:00.530
I'm proud of you.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.681
Thank you.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.086
Okay, now I need your help.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.715
The ASA snatched Tavon,
accused him of being a meta.

33:12.717 --> 33:14.677
Now they have him locked
up at the police station.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.480
All right.

33:19.482 --> 33:20.531
What do you need me to do?

33:26.656 --> 33:29.281
Hey, you hangin' in there?

33:29.283 --> 33:30.375
Huh?

33:31.902 --> 33:33.211
All right.

33:33.213 --> 33:35.446
Yo, Chief.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.548
Any chance we can get
some food up in here?

33:37.550 --> 33:39.700
- Oh, what, you hungry?
- Why do you think I'm askin'?

33:39.702 --> 33:42.502
Well, you should've thought about
that before you shot up a checkpoint.

33:43.756 --> 33:46.208
How it feels to be a Uncle Tom.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.102
How's it feels to be in jail?

33:58.113 --> 33:59.470
Hey, uh...

33:59.472 --> 34:02.139
It's been a while since
cell two ate anything,

34:02.141 --> 34:03.474
it's about time for a meal.

34:03.477 --> 34:04.916
Anything dealing with that rebel scum,

34:04.918 --> 34:07.711
including their dietary
needs, is an ASA matter

34:07.714 --> 34:09.422
and well beyond your current mandates.

34:09.425 --> 34:10.735
Mmm.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.351
_

34:18.324 --> 34:20.118
All right, Joe, let's play some cards.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.639
Okay, I'm in.

34:31.641 --> 34:33.378
Been waiting on you.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.384
Can you see what we're up against?

34:39.386 --> 34:42.487
Okay, we got about a
dozen ASA commandos,

34:42.489 --> 34:45.366
maybe ten cops, including Henderson.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.621
The holding cell's on your left.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.201
The Major's in the back.

34:55.203 --> 34:56.293
Mind getting the lights?

34:56.954 --> 34:57.962
My pleasure.

35:13.563 --> 35:15.688
There, follow that around to your left.

35:20.678 --> 35:21.903
Three o'clock.

35:28.945 --> 35:30.495
The cells are on your right.

35:38.988 --> 35:40.863
...the locks...

35:40.865 --> 35:42.202
Now.

35:44.201 --> 35:46.075
Come on, follow me.

35:46.078 --> 35:48.078
On your six.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.941
Hey, them too, get them out of there.

35:50.558 --> 35:52.558
Got it. Y'all heard the man, let's go.

35:52.561 --> 35:53.852
- Go on.
- Come on, let's go.

35:57.965 --> 35:59.092
Let's go, let's go.

36:00.424 --> 36:01.589
Say good night.

36:12.229 --> 36:13.498
Sinzell.

36:13.499 --> 36:16.106
Some dude's heading this
way, coming up to the gate.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.108
Tell him we appointment only.

36:22.165 --> 36:23.840
Yo, get those trucks gone. Go!

36:52.871 --> 36:54.287
Hi.

36:54.289 --> 36:55.538
You must be Sinzell.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.320
What you gonna do?

37:11.323 --> 37:12.329
Arrest me, huh?

37:13.717 --> 37:16.037
They don't call me when
they want someone arrested.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.979
They call me when
they want someone gone.

37:29.398 --> 37:31.974
All right, straight through
these trees about a quarter-mile.

37:31.976 --> 37:34.309
The Perdi, they'll have a
truck there waiting for you.

37:34.311 --> 37:35.727
But I'm not even a meta.

37:35.729 --> 37:38.480
Until we can prove otherwise,
this is the safer way.

37:40.076 --> 37:42.526
Could you at least tell
my parents that I love 'em?

37:42.528 --> 37:43.758
I got you.

37:49.844 --> 37:51.636
Come on, y'all, let's go.

37:51.638 --> 37:52.762
Come on.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.071
Listen...

37:55.074 --> 37:57.708
Now that they know who you
are, it's safe you leave too.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.377
Yeah, it would. But we gotta
fight the good fight, you know?

38:04.691 --> 38:06.266
No.

38:06.269 --> 38:08.236
No, I was here all night.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.864
I mean, you are tracking me, right?

38:11.866 --> 38:13.348
Isn't that what it says?

38:13.350 --> 38:14.867
Let's not play games, Mr. Pierce,

38:14.869 --> 38:17.495
we both know that you
helped attack that station.

38:17.497 --> 38:18.871
I'll say this...

38:18.873 --> 38:21.666
Everybody gets one. This was yours.

38:22.735 --> 38:25.962
Be certain it never happens again.

38:41.712 --> 38:42.979
Well...

38:42.981 --> 38:45.422
looks like we've arrived.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.067
The results have been
nothing short of remarkable.

38:48.069 --> 38:51.404
Every person who was infected is on
their way to making a full recovery.

38:51.406 --> 38:53.262
A job well done, Dr. Stewart.

38:53.265 --> 38:54.931
You certainly earned
a good night's sleep

38:54.933 --> 38:58.101
and apologies it can't be
longer, but you're needed here.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.395
What, did something happen?

39:00.397 --> 39:02.773
While your focus has
been on the meta virus,

39:02.775 --> 39:07.110
several Green Light and vaccine
kids have grown unstable.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.718
Why wasn't I informed?

39:09.782 --> 39:11.757
Get some rest, Dr. Stewart.

39:11.759 --> 39:13.742
No, not while people's
lives are at risk.

39:13.744 --> 39:14.885
Send a car, bring me in.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.172
Very well, Dr. Stewart.

39:18.174 --> 39:21.703
I applaud and appreciate your
commitment to the greater good.

39:21.706 --> 39:23.185
Goodbye.

39:24.754 --> 39:26.022
She's hooked.

39:27.942 --> 39:31.406
She doesn't realize yet, but... yes.

39:31.409 --> 39:33.520
Better yet, she thinks it's her idea.

39:33.522 --> 39:34.855
You're a genius.

39:34.857 --> 39:39.434
Not really. I only saw
to it that she got a taste

39:39.443 --> 39:43.338
of the most addictive
substance on Earth.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.407
Every time she looks at her tablet,

39:47.410 --> 39:49.277
Odell wants the phrase
"Take Green Light"

39:49.279 --> 39:51.154
flashing too fast for
her to be conscious of it,

39:51.156 --> 39:53.657
but powerful enough to plant the idea.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.785
This is good.

40:01.217 --> 40:03.217
Sir, it's Jennifer Pierce.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.818
If I couldn't light your ass up,

40:12.820 --> 40:14.845
this place might creep me out.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.864
You saw the encrypted link, I presume?

40:17.483 --> 40:19.850
Yeah, and I kind of wish I hadn't.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.577
Can all that stuff really happen here?

40:21.579 --> 40:23.979
Not if I can help, and I can.

40:23.981 --> 40:26.189
Ideally with your assistance.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.583
You have the ability to do things

40:27.585 --> 40:29.696
your father could never do, Ms. Pierce.

40:29.699 --> 40:31.026
Things like what?

40:31.029 --> 40:32.320
I asked you to meet me here

40:32.322 --> 40:35.365
because I thought it'd
be easier to show you.

40:35.367 --> 40:38.869
In that bag, you'll find a
perfect copy of your suit,

40:38.871 --> 40:40.431
and I want you to put this in your ear.

40:41.707 --> 40:42.740
And then what?

40:42.742 --> 40:45.017
Fly straight up until it beeps.

40:45.019 --> 40:46.376
Wait, what about the perimeter?

40:46.378 --> 40:47.711
Already accounted for.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.179
Now...

40:49.181 --> 40:50.981
Let's get you changed.
