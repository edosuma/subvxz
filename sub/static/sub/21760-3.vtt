There goes
that crazy Randy again,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.170
recording
those noise-polluting pups.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.000
Maybe not so crazy.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.290
Last year,
three cats recorded an album
of Christmas carols.

01:34.290 --> 01:37.080
That's right.
They became instant stars.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.500
Stars?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.710
I've just had a brilliant idea

01:41.710 --> 01:44.170
to get the Dearly farm!

01:51.710 --> 01:56.120
All:
Arf, arf, arf!

01:56.120 --> 02:00.080
Roger?
What's going on?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.880
Hmm?
Oh, hi, sweetie.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.710
Didn't you feed
these poor pups?

02:03.710 --> 02:04.960
Breakfast and lunch.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.960
And I just finished
sampling their voices

02:06.960 --> 02:09.540
to get some
advanced new sounds
for my music library.

02:09.540 --> 02:12.080
Take it from the top, guys.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.750
(barking, clucking
form music)

02:23.420 --> 02:26.920
Bravo! Bravo!
Encore.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.750
Encore.

02:28.750 --> 02:33.080
Oh, the hills were alive
with the sound of yelping.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.330
Oh, Cruella,
sorry if the pups
disturbed you.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.960
Pups?
Not just pups.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.790
Pavarotti, Carreras,
Placido!

02:42.790 --> 02:46.120
And, uh, the chicken!

02:46.120 --> 02:48.210
Gee, you really think so?

02:48.210 --> 02:51.250
Oh, they're brilliant,
inspiring!

02:51.250 --> 02:52.920
Here, sign this.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.960
What are you up to now
Cruella?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.790
Well, I'm here
to take these four virtuosos

02:57.790 --> 03:00.670
to the super stardom
they deserve!

03:00.670 --> 03:03.040
Wow!
Did she say "stardom"?

03:03.040 --> 03:05.380
We're gonna be stars!

03:05.380 --> 03:08.170
Guys, guys,
this is Cruella,

03:08.170 --> 03:11.620
the same woman
who tried to turn you
into fuzzy eveningwear?

03:11.620 --> 03:14.500
Sign this contract
and your musical
little friends

03:14.500 --> 03:16.670
will rule the charts!

03:16.670 --> 03:18.670
Gee, stardom!

03:18.670 --> 03:21.540
I could become
the spokesperson
for world peace.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.120
Or a major soft drink.
They pay better.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.540
Yeah!
And I could get
a kibble endorsement deal,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.170
with unlimited free samples.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.790
Oh, yeah!

03:31.790 --> 03:34.380
And I could get a sandwich
named after me.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.040
Oh, just think!

03:36.040 --> 03:38.920
Chicken sandwich!

03:38.920 --> 03:40.540
What an opportunity.

03:40.540 --> 03:43.000
And what's in it for you,
Cruella?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.580
Oh!
Not for me.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.960
For the children
of the world.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.120
It's reward enough
knowing I've brought
a happy smile

03:51.120 --> 03:54.330
to just one snotty
little child's face.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.330
How do I know
you're not making
the same old empty promises?

03:57.330 --> 04:00.920
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
These are brand-new
empty promises.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.210
Read the contract, Rodney.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.420
That's right.
Those great big paragraphs
at the top.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.750
You've arranged a concert
to be broadcast on TV?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.040
All over the globe!

04:12.040 --> 04:13.830
We're gonna be on TV.

04:13.830 --> 04:16.210
Your barn will be converted
into a studio,

04:16.210 --> 04:18.830
at enormous expense
to me, of course.

04:18.830 --> 04:21.170
Well, I-- I don't know.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.920
I'll even let you direct.

04:26.710 --> 04:29.880
All right, all right.
You win.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.710
I'll do it for the pups.

04:32.710 --> 04:35.120
Marvelous!
We're all in show biz!

04:35.120 --> 04:36.830
I'll have my people
call your people.

04:36.830 --> 04:40.080
Oh, that's right.
You don't have people.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.460
Now I must go arrange
the lavish sets and costumes.

04:43.460 --> 04:44.960
Kiss, kiss!

04:52.500 --> 04:54.290
Wow!

05:01.580 --> 05:06.670
"Ucky, Roy,
a Pig and Spit"?

05:15.830 --> 05:17.670
I love it!

05:17.670 --> 05:20.710
Every megawatt!

05:20.710 --> 05:22.920
I wonder if it's too subtle.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.880
Well, don't just sit there.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.790
You're late
for your costume fittings!

05:29.790 --> 05:31.620
Go, go!

05:37.330 --> 05:39.380
I don't get it.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.500
Shouldn't stars like us
have something more

05:41.500 --> 05:43.080
than second

05:43.080 --> 05:45.710
This here's all your fault,
pups.

05:45.710 --> 05:49.460
That contract Roger signed
says that all us animals

05:49.460 --> 05:51.880
have to be
in your stupid show!

05:51.880 --> 05:56.830
Daddy! This cowgirl look
just isn't me.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.710
It makes my hips look big.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.500
Hmm!

06:01.500 --> 06:03.790
You look fine, darlin'.

06:07.380 --> 06:11.250
You'll never catch me
in such a stupid getup.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.420
Why do I say things
like that?

06:15.420 --> 06:17.710
If this is the price
of stardom,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.790
it's too high!

06:19.790 --> 06:22.330
Don't worry.
Roger won't let this happen.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.710
He's the director!

06:27.750 --> 06:31.670
If we only had time
for liposuction.

06:31.670 --> 06:34.710
Good morning, Cruella.
I just came from the barn

06:34.710 --> 06:36.830
and I have a few suggestions.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.790
Let me start
with those cheap sets.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.830
No, no, actually I'll start
with the even cheaper costumes.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.830
Now as director
of this show,

06:46.830 --> 06:50.250
-I have a different vision.
-Oh, vision-smishen!

06:50.250 --> 06:52.670
I'm demoting you
to manure-removal technician.

06:56.210 --> 06:59.080
I've decided
that this production
needs genius,

06:59.080 --> 07:02.710
class, taste.
In short, me!

07:02.710 --> 07:05.960
Cruella de Vil,
producer and director!

07:05.960 --> 07:09.080
Oh!
You can't do this, Cruella.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.750
Not as long
as we have a contract.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.750
-I'm still the director.
-Were the director.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.250
Clause 15 on page 67
of our contract

07:16.250 --> 07:19.330
states that
I have power to make
all the creative decisions,

07:19.330 --> 07:22.080
including demoting you.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.420
If you don't like it, Reggie,
you can always quit.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.620
Well, if this kind
of nonsense keeps up,
we just might!

07:28.620 --> 07:29.750
Please do.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.790
Because according to
the teeny-weeny print clause

07:32.790 --> 07:34.580
way, way at the bottom...

07:34.580 --> 07:37.790
I-- I didn't even notice it.

07:37.790 --> 07:42.000
This says if I or the pups
quit for any reason--

07:42.000 --> 07:44.790
I get the farm!

07:44.790 --> 07:48.540
-Oh, no!
-Ta-ta.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.120
She bamboozled us!

07:53.120 --> 07:55.540
Well, that just means
we can't quit

07:55.540 --> 07:58.750
or Roger and Anita
lose the farm.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.880
Listen, you blithering clods,

08:00.880 --> 08:02.920
implement all phases
of my plan

08:02.920 --> 08:05.960
at the exact times
I've written down here.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.040
Follow the schedule
no matter what.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.080
We'll make those furry runts
so miserable,

08:12.080 --> 08:13.620
they'll be happy to quit.

08:13.620 --> 08:17.040
You can count on us,
Miss de Vil, sir.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.580
I've worked everything out.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.670
All the animals
know what to do.

08:21.670 --> 08:25.080
Duchess and I
are behind you 100%.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.580
Cruella:
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:27.580 --> 08:30.710
the producer and director
of our show, me,

08:30.710 --> 08:32.710
-Cruella de Vil!

08:32.710 --> 08:34.710
-Oh, you're too kind.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.460
The taking
of flash photographs

08:36.460 --> 08:39.750
and the throwing
of rotten vegetables
is strictly required.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.460
And now Cruella de Vil
proudly presents

08:42.460 --> 08:44.080
the stars of our show,

08:44.080 --> 08:48.500
Ucky, Roy,
a Pig and Spit!

08:52.540 --> 08:55.000
Those pups' plan
had better work.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.500
Okay, I'm ready.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.670
Descend me
in the right direction.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.250
-Oh!

09:05.380 --> 09:07.960
"Follow the schedule
no matter what.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.460
"Follow the schedule
no matter what.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.120
Follow the schedule
no matter what."

09:12.120 --> 09:14.210
Time for phase one--

09:14.210 --> 09:16.460
Is "phase one"
the first thing?

09:16.460 --> 09:19.540
Yes, Horace!
It is.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.460
Ahhh!

09:36.830 --> 09:39.120
Pfft!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.290
-Ahh!

09:54.330 --> 09:55.830
Time for phase two.

09:55.830 --> 09:58.120
Now is "phase two"
the second thing?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.500
This is hard for you,
isn't it?

09:59.500 --> 10:00.790
No, no.

10:00.790 --> 10:01.920
Hmm.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.040
Whaaaa!

10:09.920 --> 10:11.790
Ahhh!

10:13.790 --> 10:15.210
Phase three.

10:15.210 --> 10:17.500
Now is "phase three"
the first thing?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.920
How could it be
the first thing?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.420
Hmm, that's a toughie.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.040
Time for the final phase.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.500
Both:
"Follow the schedule
no matter what."

10:38.500 --> 10:40.620
Both:
Boo! Boo!

10:44.880 --> 10:47.460
All:
Bravo! Yeah!

10:47.460 --> 10:50.420
Oh!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.420
Nice show, Cruella.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.380
Oh, by the way,
there's somebody here
to meet you.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.380
This is
the VP of Tacky Animal Acts
at the network.

11:01.380 --> 11:05.380
And he wants you
to produce and direct
a real show.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.000
We'll put you on
every day.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.830
You'll be working
around the clock
with these little fellers.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.380
Are you insane?

11:13.380 --> 11:15.710
I've been stampeded,
drenched,

11:15.710 --> 11:18.580
rocked, rolled
and humiliated!

11:18.580 --> 11:21.210
I never want to see
those mutts again!

11:21.210 --> 11:24.540
Oh, but you're
their producer,
their director.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.170
You've got
this ironclad contract.

11:27.170 --> 11:31.040
Not anymore!
I quit!

11:31.040 --> 11:34.540
You guys will always
be stars to me.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.750
You call yourselves
a Bark Brigade?

11:46.750 --> 11:50.290
You're nothing
but a canine coffee klatch!

11:50.290 --> 11:54.250
And you've been eating
all the coffee cake.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.420
You're soft!

11:58.330 --> 12:02.080
Well, I'm here
to make you tough!
Make you mean!

12:02.080 --> 12:04.330
Make your lips suck chrome!

12:04.330 --> 12:07.620
Today you're chasing cars.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.120
Both:
All right!

12:10.120 --> 12:12.500
You know, Lieutenant,
instead of taking us

12:12.500 --> 12:14.880
on your usual machismo tour,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.290
why don't we cadets
to something enlightening,

12:17.290 --> 12:19.500
like explore
our feminine side?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.960
Feminine side, my grandma!

12:21.960 --> 12:25.250
I don't have a feminine side.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.960
Sure you do.
It's in there somewhere--

12:28.960 --> 12:33.380
the sensitive, nurturing,
patient part in all of us.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.380
Hold that thought.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.120
You mud-slinging
stick of slime!

12:46.380 --> 12:48.790
Whoa!
She's good.

12:48.790 --> 12:51.710
Maybe we should get in touch
with our feminine sides.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.880
The dog catcher!
We've got to help her.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.790
Get your feminine butts
in gear, cadets!

13:12.790 --> 13:14.880
Charge, charge!

13:32.960 --> 13:37.250
Now what do we do?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.580
Dog paddle?

13:38.580 --> 13:40.210
Too dangerous.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.670
We've got to do something.

13:41.670 --> 13:44.120
Who knows
what horrible things
are happening

13:44.120 --> 13:46.210
to Cadpig over there.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.380
-Hi, baby.

13:52.380 --> 13:53.750
Welcome to the pound.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.920
Oh, we got us
a new pup!

13:56.920 --> 13:58.710
What's your name,
spotty girl?

13:58.710 --> 14:01.330
Who's your daddy?

14:01.330 --> 14:04.750
What a welcome wagon.
I feel so accepted.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.290
Hi!
I'm Cadpig, your new roomie.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.880
And you are?

14:19.880 --> 14:22.500
Sick of you already.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.670
Well, we're a little hardened,
aren't we?

14:25.670 --> 14:28.330
I'll just call you Sassy.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.460
If you want to bark
another day,

14:30.460 --> 14:33.210
you'll call me Bonbon.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.920
Oh, that's a pretty name.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.750
Bonbon.

14:37.750 --> 14:42.670
A hard candy coating
with a soft, vulnerable center.

14:42.670 --> 14:46.250
Oh, Bon,
I love what you've done
with the place!

14:46.250 --> 14:49.170
But can I make
a teeny, weenie suggestion?

14:49.170 --> 14:51.920
Some fresh potpourri,
throw pillows and new paint

14:51.920 --> 14:54.460
would really perk up
the atmosphere.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.880
Mind if I make a suggestion?

14:56.880 --> 15:01.790
Shut up!
And keep off the top bunk!
It's mine.

15:01.790 --> 15:04.000
Works for me.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.960
Actually, I prefer
the bottom bunk.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.290
In that case,
the bottom bunk's mine!

15:09.290 --> 15:11.290
Whatever tugs your leash.

15:11.290 --> 15:14.290
There's probably a better view
from the top bunk anyway.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.330
Eeeek!

15:15.330 --> 15:17.330
They're both mine!

15:17.330 --> 15:19.670
So what you in for?

15:19.670 --> 15:22.330
Control issues?

15:22.330 --> 15:25.250
All right, men,
it's time for Plan A!

15:25.250 --> 15:28.000
Operation Island Storm.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.790
To aid us in our mission,
I've requisitioned

15:30.790 --> 15:33.460
some supplies
from the Bark Brigade
Air Force.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.330
They should be here
any minute!

15:37.380 --> 15:39.210
That hurt.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.670
What is all this stuff?

15:40.670 --> 15:42.670
You see any rations?

15:42.670 --> 15:45.670
Rescues make me hungry.

15:45.670 --> 15:49.120
You haven't rescued
anyone yet, butterbutt!

15:49.120 --> 15:53.040
But we will
as soon as we assemble
the secret weapon.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.500
Are you two done
with that helium?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.670
All finished, sir.

16:00.670 --> 16:03.210
Prepare for liftoff!

16:07.790 --> 16:09.580
We're not lifting off.

16:09.580 --> 16:14.120
-We have too much weight.
-Gah! So now I am fat.

16:23.210 --> 16:25.830
-Owww!
-Mayday, mayday!

16:25.830 --> 16:28.000
Ahh!

16:30.250 --> 16:33.710
Pffft!

16:33.710 --> 16:36.040
Ooh, a cramp! A cramp!

16:36.040 --> 16:39.620
Ayy! Huh?

16:42.170 --> 16:45.290
Anybody got a Plan B?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.080
Oh, see, Bonbon?

16:53.080 --> 16:56.420
I knew you had a soft,
vulnerable center.

16:56.420 --> 16:59.120
It's a little gooier
than I expected,

16:59.120 --> 17:02.170
but go ahead
and let it all ooze out.

17:02.170 --> 17:05.120
Nobody ever adopts me.

17:05.120 --> 17:08.210
They always pick the younger,
cuter dogs.

17:08.210 --> 17:10.210
I'll be here forever.

17:10.210 --> 17:13.040
What you have to do
is bloom where you're planted.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.620
Make the best
of this bad situation.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.420
Bad? It wasn't this bad
until you showed up.

17:20.420 --> 17:24.250
You're the one who made me
realize how miserable I am.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.960
You're displacing.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.620
Ahh!
Let me out of here!

17:29.620 --> 17:31.670
She's driving me insane!

17:31.670 --> 17:35.210
This is cruel
and unusual punishment.

17:37.580 --> 17:40.080
You could use
some relaxation techniques.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.670
Got some scented candles
and a yoga mat?

17:44.040 --> 17:46.710
We're moving on
to Plan B.

17:46.710 --> 17:51.170
This requires
strategic cunning
and precision.

17:56.830 --> 18:00.960
We'll jump on three.
One, two, aboard!

18:12.960 --> 18:15.210
Hmm.
What you need

18:15.210 --> 18:19.040
is to put on a happy face.

18:20.420 --> 18:24.380
There! Smile and the world
smiles with you.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.880
This is it, Buttons.
I'm planning a breakout.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.580
I'm breaking her out!

18:32.580 --> 18:35.000
♪ If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! ♪

18:35.000 --> 18:36.080
♪ Doo doo doo. ♪

18:36.080 --> 18:38.170
Are you clapping
in there?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.920
She's driving me nuts!

18:41.920 --> 18:45.380
If I have to
assume the lotus position
one more time,

18:45.380 --> 18:48.120
I'm chewing off
one of my legs.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.500
If I'm breaking anybody out,
it's gonna be me.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.120
Ah, ah, ah,
don't break out.
Look inward.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.580
Find the inner puppy,
pull him out

18:56.580 --> 18:58.460
and give him a hug.

18:58.460 --> 19:02.420
Ho! Let's hold paws
in a circle and talk about
what makes us happy.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.580
♪ Kumbaya, my Lord... ♪

19:15.580 --> 19:19.000
Man:
Back to your cages!
Chow time!

19:20.580 --> 19:24.580
-Come back!

19:24.580 --> 19:26.790
We're in.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.960
We're in trouble.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.420
Get used to it.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.120
Lights out!

19:36.170 --> 19:38.540
Cadpig:
Let's all sing a rondelet

19:38.540 --> 19:41.380
of Meet Me Tonight
in Dream Land.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.960
-All: Make it stop!
-Okay, you win, Bonbon.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.170
We're breaking her out
tonight.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.460
Lieutenant Pug:
Listen here,
Buttons and Bows!

19:49.460 --> 19:51.120
I'm in charge
of this rescue.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.380
Well,
you're in my territory now.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.460
And I give the orders!

19:55.460 --> 19:58.000
Suppose I mark this
my territory?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
You ain't got it in ya.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.880
They don't call me
"Pug the Jug" for nothing.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.500
Why don't you roll over
and play dead

20:05.500 --> 20:07.710
before I make it a reality?

20:07.710 --> 20:09.750
That's it!
Now you've done it.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.040
Frightening
a superior officer!

20:12.040 --> 20:15.620
I've got a good mind to--

20:15.620 --> 20:17.420
He plays dead pretty good.

20:17.420 --> 20:20.330
Happens a lot.
He'll be back any minute.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.960
Really? Hmm.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.500
That gives me
an idea.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.830
Ah! Looks like you need
to see the vet.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.830
Oh, where'd I put
that vet's number?

20:41.830 --> 20:43.580
Ahh!

20:43.580 --> 20:46.710
I've lost time again.
Where am I?

20:46.710 --> 20:48.710
Bright lights, instruments,

20:48.710 --> 20:50.920
charts, cold table!

20:50.920 --> 20:55.040
Agh!
I've been abducted by aliens.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.960
Lieutenant,
push the cage-release button.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.540
I don't take orders
from you!

21:05.540 --> 21:08.960
But, uh, it was your idea,
Lieutenant sir,

21:08.960 --> 21:10.460
before you blacked out.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.960
Uh, Plan C, remember?

21:12.960 --> 21:15.920
Eh, of course I remember.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.710
"C" for cage release.

21:22.790 --> 21:26.000
-This way, cadets.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.830
Move 'em out!

21:31.830 --> 21:34.960
Come on,
taste your freedom!

21:34.960 --> 21:36.670
Uh, we're staying.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.290
Knowing you're out there
makes us happy to be in here.

21:40.290 --> 21:43.290
That's just the attitude
I was hoping for!

21:43.290 --> 21:45.290
My work here is done.

21:45.290 --> 21:49.250
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

21:49.250 --> 21:52.670
I am so glad
I got through

21:52.670 --> 21:55.210
to my new friends
back at the pound.

21:55.210 --> 21:59.170
And I'm glad my best friends
came through for me.

21:59.170 --> 22:00.580
Both:
Uh-huh.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.750
It would be
a much better world

22:02.750 --> 22:05.380
if we all came through
for each other.

22:05.380 --> 22:09.420
Where's a blackout
when you need one?

22:09.420 --> 22:11.420
That's better.
