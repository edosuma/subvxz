WEBVTT

00:09.927 --> 00:13.680
Know where we should go tonight?
Frannie's Fish and Chips.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.850
Dad, we're taking Niles out
to boost his spirits, not his cholesterol.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.060
Oh, please.

00:18.268 --> 00:21.021
That French food you guys eat
is full of butter and cheese.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.690
But at least it's not prepared
by a woman working a deep fryer

00:23.857 --> 00:26.318
in a batter-dipped brassiere.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.029
- Hey, isn't that Niles?
- Where?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.363
Driving that old hatchback.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.784
No, Niles would never be seen
in anything called a hatchback.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.412
Although it does look a lot like him.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.334
My God, he's running away.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.086
Well, catch him,
Mr. 12-Cylinder-German-Engineering.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.803
<i>- Hello?
- Niles, what the hell are you doing?</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:55.930
Well, I'm just pulling
into my parking garage.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.224
<i>- You on your way?
- What are you talking about?</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:01.436
- You're driving up Second Avenue.
- You're in that little red thing.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.480
No, you must be
mistaking me for someone else.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.690
See you when you get here.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.944
He's getting away!
He just turned right at the corner.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.531
<i>- Hello?
- Niles?</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.742
What are you running for?
I can see that it's you.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.369
No, you're mistaking me
for someone else.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.579
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:22.165
I can hear my own horn
through the phone.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.378
Frasier, I may lose the connection.
I'm stepping onto my elevator.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.172
I'll see you when you...

01:30.715 --> 01:33.051
- What's the matter with him?
- Maris repossessed his car.

01:33.217 --> 01:34.969
That must've been
all he was able to afford.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.888
He's just ashamed to admit it.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.266
<i>- Hello?
- Niles, do not hang up on me.</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:43.269
We know what's going on.
We're right behind you.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.812
I was afraid this would happen.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.441
I was petrified someone I knew would
see me driving this humiliating car.

01:48.649 --> 01:50.985
It looks like some buggy derailed
from a carnival ride,

01:51.152 --> 01:54.405
except that
this has no safety features.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.449
Oh, Niles,
you're worrying over nothing.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.660
What kind of person judges you
by the sort of car you drive?

02:00.119 --> 02:02.079
<i>- Mitzie Gill.
- Well, yes, she might.</i>

02:02.246 --> 02:04.415
<i>- She drives a Bentley.
- She's parking on the corner.</i>

02:04.582 --> 02:05.833
She'll see me.

02:10.670 --> 02:11.922
Everybody all right?

02:12.131 --> 02:14.008
Dad, come quickly. I need your help.

02:14.216 --> 02:15.468
Oh, my God, what is it?

02:15.634 --> 02:18.888
<i>I need you to get up here
and pretend this is your car.</i>

02:26.812 --> 02:28.063
My shoulder is killing me.

02:28.230 --> 02:30.232
Good Lord,
did you bang into the steering wheel?

02:30.441 --> 02:33.903
No, I've been parallel parking all week
without power steering.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.947
- Let me get you some aspirin.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.

02:37.114 --> 02:40.200
Check upstairs
in the bathroom off the study.

02:40.409 --> 02:41.577
Pardon the disarray, Frasier.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.496
I've had to cut my cleaning lady
down to two times a week.

02:44.663 --> 02:47.583
Yeah, looks like a bomb went off.

02:48.417 --> 02:51.211
I gather your financial situation's
gotten a bit shaky.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.131
Oh, yes. Every since I rejected
Maris' attempt to woo me back,

02:54.298 --> 02:56.133
she's been quite vindictive.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.385
She's frozen all the accounts. Sherry?

02:58.594 --> 02:59.720
Thank you.

02:59.887 --> 03:02.181
My salary isn't even covering
my legal bills.

03:02.347 --> 03:03.932
Well, what do your lawyers tell you?

03:04.141 --> 03:08.228
Well, mostly that my salary
isn't even covering my legal bills.

03:12.107 --> 03:13.483
You know, Niles,

03:13.650 --> 03:16.737
if this siege is going to continue,
you may have to tighten your belt a bit.

03:16.903 --> 03:19.614
Perhaps we should make up a list
of your expenses.

03:19.781 --> 03:22.075
All right. Here.

03:22.284 --> 03:24.077
Thank you. Oh, not with that pen.

03:24.286 --> 03:27.205
No, that once belonged
to Noel Coward.

03:27.414 --> 03:29.458
- I just purchased it.
- It is stunning.

03:29.624 --> 03:31.042
But if you're gonna be economizing,

03:31.209 --> 03:33.920
perhaps you'll have to forgo
the decorative antique pens.

03:34.087 --> 03:37.090
Could we at least review my list
before we make any drastic decisions?

03:37.299 --> 03:40.927
- Very well.
- That's my rent.

03:41.094 --> 03:44.306
- That's insurance.
- You pay that much in rent?

03:45.557 --> 03:47.350
Well, that includes
the building newsletter.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.603
It's outrageous.

03:49.769 --> 03:52.188
<i>- Niles, are you there?
- Yes, Dad.</i>

03:52.397 --> 03:54.316
Well, you can't blame me
for the housing market.

03:54.482 --> 03:55.567
This is a simple apartment.

03:55.734 --> 03:59.362
<i>I'm in some room with a lot of books,
but it doesn't have a bathroom.</i>

04:00.030 --> 04:02.407
Oh, that's the library, not the study.

04:02.615 --> 04:03.825
Go down the hall, make a left.

04:03.992 --> 04:07.120
Yes, well, this simple apartment
of yours is gonna bankrupt you.

04:07.287 --> 04:09.247
You must admit
it's a bit large for one person.

04:09.456 --> 04:10.790
Well, don't forget I have a pet.

04:10.957 --> 04:15.295
Are you telling me that your bird
requires both a study and a library?

04:16.254 --> 04:18.089
All right, I will return
the Noel Coward pen,

04:18.255 --> 04:20.132
but this is my home.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.218
This is a basic necessity.

04:22.886 --> 04:26.014
<i>Okay, I found the aspirin,
but I'm lost again.</i>

04:26.180 --> 04:29.100
<i>I'm in a blue room
with big rolls of paper.</i>

04:29.309 --> 04:31.519
<i>That's the gift-wrapping room.</i>

04:34.022 --> 04:35.064
Look for the stairs.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.108
<i>The only stairs I could find go up.</i>

04:37.316 --> 04:39.694
You have a third floor?

04:40.236 --> 04:41.529
It's practically a crawlspace.

04:42.447 --> 04:45.533
Go out the door to the left.

04:48.119 --> 04:50.788
Don't look at me like that.
I have to have a roof over my head.

04:50.997 --> 04:53.166
Niles, you have three roofs
over your head.

04:53.374 --> 04:55.209
For God's sake,
come to your senses.

04:55.418 --> 04:56.919
Look at the numbers. They don't lie.

04:57.086 --> 04:58.713
I'm afraid you don't have any choice.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.756
All right, now I'm stumped.
How do I get down?

05:00.923 --> 05:02.717
There's a bookcase
blocking my way.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.720
- The bookcase is a secret door, Dad.
- How do I open it?

05:05.928 --> 05:08.347
<i>- Poke Mrs. Dalloway on the bottom.
- What?</i>

05:08.556 --> 05:12.935
- The yellow book on the lower shelf.
- Oh, all right.

05:13.144 --> 05:15.229
Frasier, ever since I was a little boy,

05:15.396 --> 05:17.231
I have walked by this building
and wondered

05:17.398 --> 05:20.025
what sort of people could live
in such a magnificent place.

05:20.234 --> 05:21.485
I know, Niles.

05:21.694 --> 05:25.114
Getting in here
after Maris dumped me

05:25.281 --> 05:27.199
proved that I was not
a complete failure.

05:27.408 --> 05:28.576
I understand that.

05:29.785 --> 05:31.745
And I have no choice, do I?

05:32.329 --> 05:33.664
I'm sorry.

05:34.748 --> 05:36.125
You know,
perhaps you should move

05:36.292 --> 05:38.294
before you're obligated
for another month's rent.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.462
You can stay at my place
until you find something.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.340
Thank you.

05:43.507 --> 05:47.886
Here you go.
You can get your own glass of water.

05:49.346 --> 05:53.100
- This aspirin's expired.
- Well, it wasn't when I found it.

05:58.647 --> 06:01.066
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'll clean up.
- Not necessary.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.776
You've been cooking dinner
every night.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.945
I hardly feel like
it's my kitchen anymore.

06:05.112 --> 06:08.699
Of course it's your kitchen.
No, no, that doesn't go there.

06:09.783 --> 06:12.911
I know it's probably
a bit presumptuous of me

06:13.078 --> 06:15.372
to rearrange your kitchen for you,
but I promise you,

06:15.539 --> 06:18.375
you'll find it a lot more...

06:21.128 --> 06:23.171
...user-friendly.

06:24.256 --> 06:27.217
- Where's my jar of Bovril?
- No, I wasn't.

06:31.179 --> 06:35.100
Oh, the meat paste.
Well, I threw it out. It smelled rancid.

06:35.308 --> 06:38.395
Well, that's how it's supposed to smell.
It's English.

06:40.730 --> 06:43.108
Well, I'm off to bed.

06:45.443 --> 06:47.445
Roz and I have a very important
breakfast meeting

06:47.612 --> 06:49.030
with a potential employer tomorrow,

06:49.197 --> 06:51.575
and I can't be burning
the midnight oil like you, Dad.

06:52.784 --> 06:55.870
- Dad?
- What? Oh, all right, I'll get a coaster.

06:56.037 --> 06:57.163
No.

06:58.081 --> 07:00.458
What's with you? You could
barely stay awake during dinner.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.836
You'd be the same way
if you shared a room with Niles.

07:03.044 --> 07:06.631
All night long, up and down,
shifting and tucking.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.259
If it's really annoying you,
I'll move his cot into my room.

07:09.467 --> 07:11.886
At least one of us in this family
could show him compassion.

07:12.053 --> 07:14.431
Good luck. Last night,
I got up and went to the bathroom.

07:14.597 --> 07:17.058
When I came back,
he'd made my bed.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:32.907 --> 07:35.493
- Will you be much longer?
- Almost done.

07:35.702 --> 07:36.869
I only ask because Roz and I

07:37.036 --> 07:39.080
have this important job interview
tomorrow morning.

07:39.247 --> 07:41.332
I'd like to be well-rested.

07:41.541 --> 07:44.585
- You've been in there for 20 minutes.
- No, I haven't.

07:45.086 --> 07:46.504
Now I have.

07:47.714 --> 07:50.049
You should try
this marvellous new facial peel.

07:50.258 --> 07:51.843
It's like getting ten years back.

07:52.051 --> 07:54.345
I'd settle for the last half hour.

07:54.512 --> 07:56.013
This is gonna be so much fun.

07:56.222 --> 07:58.850
Bunking together
like when we were kids.

08:02.270 --> 08:05.815
Oh, yes.
It's all coming back to me now.

08:06.732 --> 08:08.067
I just want to tell you again

08:08.234 --> 08:10.653
how much I appreciate
your taking me in like this.

08:10.820 --> 08:13.656
Not every brother in your position
would be so generous.

08:13.864 --> 08:17.284
Think nothing of it, Niles.
You're no trouble at all.

08:46.814 --> 08:51.110
Oh, dear, the sound of that rain's
gonna keep me up all night.

08:51.568 --> 08:55.239
I'm amazed you can hear it
over there in Mission Control.

08:56.699 --> 09:00.119
- Do you mind if I close the window?
- Not at all.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.417
Much better.

09:12.214 --> 09:15.133
Niles, what are you talking about?
That's just more rain noise.

09:15.342 --> 09:16.510
No, it's much more than rain.

09:16.677 --> 09:20.138
This is all of the sounds
of the Brazilian rainforest.

09:21.098 --> 09:23.559
- Does it bother you?
- No.

09:24.351 --> 09:26.103
Just go to bed.

09:29.982 --> 09:31.942
Oh, for God's sake, Niles!

09:32.150 --> 09:35.153
All right, all right,
I'll switch over to "Babbling Brook."

09:37.823 --> 09:40.367
You know, if you're feeling tense
about that interview,

09:40.534 --> 09:42.411
I could show you
one of my breathing exercises.

09:42.577 --> 09:45.664
No, no, just some sleep will do.

09:45.872 --> 09:48.208
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:11.189 --> 10:14.401
Oh, for God's sakes, Niles!

10:16.027 --> 10:19.280
- What the hell happened?
- Isn't it obvious? You blew a fuse.

10:19.447 --> 10:22.367
You haven't seen anything yet.

10:26.663 --> 10:29.207
I know he's on his way.
He must've gotten the address wrong.

10:29.374 --> 10:32.502
I knew I should've picked a place
he'd been to before.

10:32.919 --> 10:35.630
- I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have to leave.
- Oh, please, don't leave.

10:35.797 --> 10:38.132
- Let me just try his cell phone.
- Very well.

10:39.884 --> 10:42.595
Hello, Frasier, it's Roz.

10:42.762 --> 10:45.306
You sound terrible. Where are you?

10:45.473 --> 10:46.808
The emergency room?

10:47.392 --> 10:49.686
Oh, my God! His appendix burst.

10:49.852 --> 10:51.396
No, no, no, no, don't apologize.

10:51.604 --> 10:53.564
It's not your fault.
We'll just reschedule it.

10:53.773 --> 10:56.192
I am so sorry I'm late.

10:56.359 --> 10:58.528
My usual, please.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.280
My phone, please.

11:01.781 --> 11:03.866
Mr. Draper,
you're not leaving, are you?

11:04.033 --> 11:07.829
I have another meeting
and I don't like to keep people waiting.

11:07.995 --> 11:10.498
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Roz, please, I'm so sorry.

11:10.706 --> 11:12.208
- Where have you been?
- Blame Niles.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.877
He kept me up late last night.
I slept right through my alarm.

11:15.086 --> 11:17.255
What's he still doing there?
Hasn't he found a place?

11:17.421 --> 11:19.173
No, he sublet his apartment
at the Montana.

11:19.340 --> 11:22.218
He has to find something furnished.
There aren't that many out there.

11:22.385 --> 11:25.179
- Still, he's looking every day.
- Not yesterday.

11:25.388 --> 11:26.430
What do you mean?

11:26.639 --> 11:30.351
<i>I saw him out in front of the Varsity
waiting in line for Lawrence of Arabia.</i>

11:30.518 --> 11:32.895
That's impossible. He told me
he had appointments all day.

11:33.062 --> 11:34.563
Frasier, I know Niles
when I see him.

11:34.730 --> 11:38.025
How many people go to the movies
with their own seat cushion?

11:39.235 --> 11:41.195
You mean,
he hasn't even been looking?

11:41.362 --> 11:44.365
I don't know. Ask him yourself.

11:44.532 --> 11:46.283
Niles.

11:47.284 --> 11:48.619
- Frasier.
- Yes.

11:48.786 --> 11:51.455
Off for another day
of apartment hunting?

11:51.622 --> 11:53.415
Yes. Yes.

11:53.582 --> 11:56.001
Only hope I see as many
as I saw yesterday.

11:56.168 --> 11:57.336
Covered the whole waterfront.

11:57.503 --> 12:00.381
Oh, well, then you must have seen
the one on Crawford and Pike.

12:00.881 --> 12:04.259
- Yes, I think so.
- White with blue trim?

12:04.468 --> 12:06.678
Right next to the market.
Couple of flags out front.

12:06.887 --> 12:09.932
Yes, it looks nice from the outside.
It's completely unsuitable for living.

12:10.099 --> 12:14.228
Oh, yes. I'd imagine so,
seeing as it's a Chevron station.

12:15.229 --> 12:18.232
- What?
- You saw nothing.

12:18.398 --> 12:20.734
Nothing yesterday,
probably nothing in the last two weeks.

12:20.901 --> 12:24.154
- You've been going to the movies.
- That is an outrageous lie.

12:24.363 --> 12:27.407
Roz saw you and your seat cushion.

12:27.950 --> 12:29.409
Here I was feeling sorry for you

12:29.618 --> 12:31.703
and you were lying to me
the whole time.

12:33.288 --> 12:34.831
I'm sorry.

12:35.207 --> 12:37.793
After the first day,
I just couldn't look anymore.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.420
I'll never find anything tolerable
in my price range.

12:40.587 --> 12:43.423
It's barely tolerable
having a price range.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.551
All right, Niles. Well, listen.
Today, I am going with you.

12:46.718 --> 12:48.929
It may be the only way
you ever find a place.

12:49.096 --> 12:51.056
You sound as if I plan
to stay with you forever.

12:51.264 --> 12:54.100
Well, I did notice you put a bottle
of '93 Pichon-Baron

12:54.267 --> 12:57.103
- on the grocery list last night.
- So?

12:57.312 --> 13:00.190
That wine's not even drinkable
for two years.

13:02.609 --> 13:05.946
And we've got a rec room too.
Did you see the hot tub?

13:06.112 --> 13:09.449
If you're referring
to that six-man Petri dish, yes.

13:09.616 --> 13:12.535
- I think we're about finished here.
- We can't leave without seeing it.

13:12.702 --> 13:16.206
Frank was kind enough to put on pants
and bring us up here.

13:17.123 --> 13:21.252
Welcome to the Shangri-la.

13:27.467 --> 13:31.554
Niles, it's magnificent.

13:36.226 --> 13:38.269
I think you'll see
why the Shangri-la is so popular

13:38.436 --> 13:40.647
with bachelors like yourself.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.273
I had assumed it was that charming

13:42.440 --> 13:46.110
"No credit, no problem" banner
out front.

13:46.319 --> 13:48.613
Here's your kitchen, all modern.

13:48.821 --> 13:51.491
It looks like the previous tenant
left a four-slot toaster behind.

13:51.658 --> 13:52.992
Isn't that something, Niles?

13:53.159 --> 13:54.661
You can make yourself
a club sandwich

13:54.827 --> 13:56.871
and still have a slice left for guests.

13:57.580 --> 13:59.082
I think I've got the lay of the land.

13:59.248 --> 14:01.000
No, wait, we haven't seen
the bedroom yet.

14:01.167 --> 14:03.503
Right this way.

14:11.677 --> 14:13.262
Looks like
he left the sheets behind.

14:13.471 --> 14:14.931
Well, how's that for convenience?

14:15.097 --> 14:17.600
No dust bunnies under that bed.
No, sirree.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.519
That is a vacuumer's dream, that is.

14:20.686 --> 14:23.272
Well, let's have a look
at this closet space, shall we?

14:23.439 --> 14:26.942
Oh, sorry, I thought Gary's sister
was supposed to pick this stuff up.

14:27.151 --> 14:29.737
Well, help yourself.

14:30.821 --> 14:34.825
This Gary certainly
seems to have left in a hurry.

14:34.992 --> 14:36.577
Did he leave no forwarding address?

14:37.953 --> 14:41.957
He left a note, but no.

14:43.292 --> 14:44.585
No address.

14:45.628 --> 14:48.589
Well, take your time.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.510
- Now can we go?
- No, no, Niles.

14:53.677 --> 14:58.766
Not before we've had a look at this
very charming little ironing board here.

14:58.933 --> 14:59.975
There you are, see?

15:00.184 --> 15:02.102
You sure that's not the guest room?

15:05.773 --> 15:08.567
Niles, listen,
I know this isn't what you had in mind,

15:08.776 --> 15:10.152
but we have scoured the city.

15:10.319 --> 15:12.821
I'm afraid this is the only thing
we're gonna find.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.657
Well, I wanna keep looking.
There's no rush.

15:17.367 --> 15:20.120
- Well, actually...
- What?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.789
Well, Niles...

15:23.123 --> 15:26.835
You want me to move out.
I've overstayed my welcome. I see.

15:27.002 --> 15:28.587
No, it's time for you to understand

15:28.795 --> 15:31.340
that your circumstances
have changed,

15:31.506 --> 15:33.217
and you're going to have to adapt.

15:33.425 --> 15:36.178
I don't want to adapt.
I want to go home.

15:36.345 --> 15:38.138
Niles,

15:38.347 --> 15:40.641
you are home.

15:45.937 --> 15:51.276
Well, where are my manners?
Can I get you some toast?

16:06.416 --> 16:08.251
Yes.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.173
Well, I'm off.
Oh, your brother called.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.675
He said he won't be joining you
for the wine club tonight.

16:16.217 --> 16:18.178
Really? That's a first.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.639
You know, it's funny how much
Eddie misses that bird of Dr. Crane's.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.309
This morning,
a pigeon landed on the terrace.

16:24.476 --> 16:27.687
Eddie jumped up, excited,
ran over and started barking at it.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.105
Yes, he does that all the time.

16:29.272 --> 16:32.734
No, this was a different sort of bark.
Like, "You're not my bird.

16:32.942 --> 16:36.571
Don't fly here and get me hopes
up like that. You're not my bird."

16:38.490 --> 16:41.326
It was silly and sad
at the same time, you know?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.620
Firsthand.

16:45.580 --> 16:49.208
- Did Niles say why he cancelled at all?
- No.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.377
You know,
I just hope he's not depressed.

16:51.544 --> 16:55.298
I keep picturing him sitting
in that dreadful apartment all alone.

16:55.923 --> 16:58.926
Maybe I should've let him stay here
longer until he found something nicer.

16:59.135 --> 17:00.970
I'm sure once he gets his books
on the shelf

17:01.137 --> 17:03.014
and his opera playing, he'll be fine.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.016
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

17:05.183 --> 17:09.395
Fras, your antique scout brought over
that Noel Coward pen you bought.

17:10.688 --> 17:13.273
Noel Coward pen?
Like the one your brother's got?

17:13.483 --> 17:17.319
Oh, it is his.
He returned it and I pounced on it.

17:17.528 --> 17:19.696
Dr. Crane's feeling bad
about moving his brother out.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.909
Oh, come on, Fras, he's a big boy.
You just gave him the push he needed.

17:23.492 --> 17:24.868
Well, he did need a push.

17:25.077 --> 17:28.122
Besides, I'm sure the place
you found him isn't as bad as all that.

17:28.289 --> 17:30.082
You're right, Daphne.
It isn't all that bad.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.710
And once he's decorated it,
it'll be much nicer.

17:32.877 --> 17:36.422
You're right. You're right.
I'm being much too hard on myself.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.550
- He'll be happy at the Shangri-la.
- You got him in the Shangri-la?

17:39.717 --> 17:42.094
That's where Duke stayed
during his divorce.

17:42.261 --> 17:46.015
Let me tell you,
that's my kind of place.

17:47.391 --> 17:49.685
What have I done?

17:58.861 --> 17:59.904
Hey, Niles.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.447
- Dad, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.657
Did you not get my message
about the wine club?

18:03.866 --> 18:05.868
We thought it'd be fun
to go out and have a meal.

18:06.035 --> 18:07.786
Oh, well, actually,
I'm on my way out.

18:07.995 --> 18:10.581
Where to? Bali-ha'i?

18:11.707 --> 18:14.209
No, they're having a Ping-Pong
tournament in the rumpus room

18:14.376 --> 18:17.463
and my neighbour Jimbo
has invited me to be his partner.

18:17.671 --> 18:20.007
Let me go and tell him
that I'll be a couple minutes late.

18:20.174 --> 18:23.302
If you're thirsty, they sent up some
wine coolers in my welcome basket.

18:23.469 --> 18:24.845
Hey. And you were worried.

18:25.012 --> 18:27.389
He's making friends,
taking part in activities.

18:27.556 --> 18:32.102
Dad, he's obviously covering.
That shirt alone is a shriek for help.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.813
Is it so hard for you to believe
that he could be happy?

18:35.022 --> 18:36.982
In this place, yes.

18:38.233 --> 18:39.276
You should stay.

18:39.443 --> 18:42.029
The guys in D building
are bringing over a 6-foot sub,

18:42.237 --> 18:45.824
and they've rigged the pinball machine
so it's free play all night.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.743
Niles, I'm finding it a bit difficult

18:47.909 --> 18:50.495
to accept this newfound enthusiasm
of yours.

18:50.704 --> 18:53.457
Weren't you the one who told me
I should adjust to my circumstances?

18:53.623 --> 18:56.334
I'm just concerned that you're
immersing yourself in this lifestyle

18:56.501 --> 18:58.170
to avoid feeling the pain
you're going...

18:58.378 --> 19:01.214
Would you leave the guy alone?
No, he's obviously having a good time.

19:01.381 --> 19:05.343
- I'm having a very good time.
- Why shouldn't he have a good time?

19:05.552 --> 19:08.346
I'd be happy here myself.
This is my kind of place.

19:09.097 --> 19:12.976
- Get me out of this hellhole.
- What did I say?

19:13.185 --> 19:16.271
I can't live this charade. I have tried.
It's taking too much out of me.

19:16.438 --> 19:19.524
Now, Niles, this place is fine.
And you know what they say:

19:19.733 --> 19:21.860
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

19:22.068 --> 19:24.654
But, Dad, not everyone
makes it into that second group.

19:24.821 --> 19:28.241
And I've got the luau shirt to prove it.
Okay, that's it, that's it.

19:28.450 --> 19:30.410
Enough is enough.

19:30.910 --> 19:32.203
Niles, who are you calling?

19:32.412 --> 19:35.123
I'm calling Maris.
I'm going to beg her to take me back.

19:35.331 --> 19:36.875
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yes, I do.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.419
Life with Maris wasn't so bad.
It was my fault, after all.

19:39.627 --> 19:41.463
I was too rigid.
I was always making demands.

19:41.629 --> 19:44.257
- No, Niles.
- Eat something. Unlock this door.

19:44.424 --> 19:46.551
- Don't throw that.
- Niles, give me that phone.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.303
- No.
- You don't know what you're doing.

19:48.469 --> 19:50.305
- Yes, I do.
- Drop it and kick it over here.

19:50.471 --> 19:53.266
I won't. I'm dialling.
I'm pressing send.

19:53.474 --> 19:54.934
It's ringing.

19:55.143 --> 19:56.603
Maris.

19:56.769 --> 19:58.813
I'm calling...

19:59.022 --> 20:00.648
I'm calling...

20:03.026 --> 20:05.320
I'm calling to tell you
that there is a new address

20:05.486 --> 20:08.031
for forwarding my mail.

20:08.197 --> 20:13.119
It's 62 Elm Street,
Shangri-la Apartments.

20:13.870 --> 20:15.538
Thank you.

20:17.373 --> 20:19.417
Well, good for you, Niles.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.795
The second I heard her voice
I knew I couldn't go back.

20:23.796 --> 20:27.967
- But how am I ever going to live here?
- Now, it's just temporary, Niles.

20:28.175 --> 20:30.344
She can't drag
this divorce out forever.

20:31.095 --> 20:33.931
You know, Niles, perhaps this place

20:34.098 --> 20:36.934
is the price you'll have to pay
for your freedom.

20:38.728 --> 20:40.604
Well, it's worth that.

20:40.813 --> 20:44.233
Well, that's the way to look at it.
So let's have a toast to that.

20:44.442 --> 20:46.736
Thank you, Dad.

20:49.113 --> 20:51.073
You know,
I never did sign my lease.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.452
I suppose
now is as good a time as any.

20:56.203 --> 20:58.581
Niles, perhaps
this will make it easier.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.543
A little housewarming gift.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.964
Thank you.

21:08.424 --> 21:10.134
There we go.

21:11.427 --> 21:13.137
Thanks, Dad.

21:13.304 --> 21:15.556
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:15.723 --> 21:18.225
Here's looking at you, kids.

21:23.147 --> 21:24.231
You know, Niles,

21:24.440 --> 21:26.942
you may have to sleep here,
but you don't have to eat here.

21:27.109 --> 21:28.652
How does Cigare Volant sound?

21:29.194 --> 21:30.237
Music to my ears.

21:30.404 --> 21:32.072
I can't go in that place
without a jacket.

21:32.239 --> 21:34.074
Maybe we should paw
through that closet.

21:34.241 --> 21:36.493
I bet Gary's got a jacket
that'll match those pants.

21:37.369 --> 21:41.290
- Oh, here we are.
- Yeah! Look at that. That's great.
