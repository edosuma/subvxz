00:06.474 --> 00:10.275
Honey, this is
our first year
hosting the holidays.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.777
Is your mom gonna
go easy on me?

00:11.779 --> 00:13.946
- You want comfort or truth?
- Comfort.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.615
It's gonna be hideous.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.916
I said i want you
to comfort me!

00:17.918 --> 00:20.853
It's gonna be hideous.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.223
It's maya's first time
with us,

00:24.225 --> 00:26.225
And i need the holiday
to go good for her.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.761
Well, i need the holiday
to be good for your mother.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.963
Liar!

00:30.965 --> 00:33.832
Liar!

00:33.834 --> 00:36.435
I need the holiday
to be good for shawn.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.337
Shawn's coming!

00:39.774 --> 00:40.839
<i>( intercom buzzes )</i>

00:42.309 --> 00:43.909
Shawn?!

00:43.911 --> 00:45.244
Maya: <i> Maya!</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:46.745
Shawn?!

00:46.747 --> 00:49.281
<i>Aw, what's the matter?</i>
<i>Your boyfriend's not here yet?</i>

00:49.283 --> 00:51.283
He's not my boyfriend!

00:51.285 --> 00:52.718
Oh, then what are
we going to do with

00:52.720 --> 00:55.487
This "cory and shawn
4-evah!" ornament?

00:55.489 --> 00:57.906
Oh, that?

00:57.907 --> 01:00.324
That goes right in front
of the cory and topanga
wedding ornament.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.895
My whole life.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.630
Auggie, wanna help
with dinner?

01:05.933 --> 01:08.400
I don't even think
he exists.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.968
He's real, maya.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.236
I've known the guy
my whole life,

01:11.238 --> 01:12.237
And he's real.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.639
You're fun to play with.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.442
Riley, i got you
a present.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.611
"a donation's
been made in your name

01:19.613 --> 01:21.547
To the maya
new winter coat fund."

01:22.850 --> 01:24.016
Thank you,
it's beautiful.

01:24.018 --> 01:25.284
I'm glad you like it.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.352
I never know
what to get people.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.888
So, what's the deal on
the mysterious uncle shawn?

01:29.890 --> 01:32.357
I don't see him a lot.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.892
I don't think he likes me.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.077
Riley.

01:35.078 --> 01:36.261
How could someone
not like you?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.696
Ask him
and let me know.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.265
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- shawn!

01:40.267 --> 01:42.267
Alan:
<i>No, it's your parents.</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:43.902
Rats!

01:43.904 --> 01:46.605

01:46.607 --> 01:49.374
Amy:
<i>These holidays are</i>
<i>important to me, alan.</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:51.944
<i>How much of a fiasco</i>
<i>do you think it's gonna be?</i>

01:51.946 --> 01:53.612
( mouths )

01:53.614 --> 01:57.449
Alan:
<i>Let me explain how</i>
<i>a speaker box works.</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:59.418
Hideous already.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.120
How about i throw
this pot at you?!

02:01.122 --> 02:04.723
( baby-talk )
they don't think you're real,
but i know you are.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.628
She tried to hurt you,

Maybe he's just
not a big talker.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.576
Cor, time to talk.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.578
We got a lot

- Can read...

That's pretty impressive.
You're still not me and cory.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.957
Why do you make
riley feel bad?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.462
I don't mean to.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.430
Well, you do.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.100
And that's not
cool with me.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.802
'cause i'm her
best friend.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.171
So i just wanted
to tell you that.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.376
Hey.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.245
Maybe you are like
me and cory.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.156
Hold this, will you?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.925
Should we be doing this?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.193
- Absolutely.
- ( snoring softly )

09:22.195 --> 09:24.062
What the difference
between having

09:24.064 --> 09:26.298
A younger daddy
and an older daddy?

09:26.300 --> 09:28.033
Younger daddy doesn't
fall asleep

09:28.035 --> 09:29.467
In the middle
of of a party?

09:39.479 --> 09:41.012
How could you possibly
not like riley?

09:41.014 --> 09:43.248
- Maya.
- What is she talking about?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.917
Whenever you do
come here,

09:45.919 --> 09:47.052
It's like you find
some excuse

09:47.054 --> 09:49.287
Not to talk to me
and then you leave.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.123
I talk to you.
I'm talking to you right now.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.525
When's my birthday?

09:53.527 --> 09:55.060
What's my favorite color?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.895
Riley, that stuff
doesn't matter.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.130
It does matter.
Tell us what you know.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.132
Girls...

10:01.134 --> 10:03.134
Shawn knows
riley's birthday.

How do you know?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.137
He knows.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.173
Amy:
What you got there?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.874
Butternut squash soup.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.043
My-- my specialty?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.179
You-- you made
my specialty?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.213
How could you make--

10:16.817 --> 10:18.817
Because i wanted you
to know

10:18.819 --> 10:20.986
That even though
the holidays are
here now,

10:20.988 --> 10:22.120
You will always
have a part

10:22.122 --> 10:24.222
In putting them
together.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.192
Tastes just like mine.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.094
That's because
i used your recipe.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.797
In fact, i used
your recipe to put
together the whole day.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.332
Thank you.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.501
Thank <i> you.</i>

10:37.904 --> 10:39.104
Dinner, everybody!

10:39.106 --> 10:40.505
Mm!

10:48.915 --> 10:50.582
Five minutes?!

10:50.583 --> 10:52.250
That dinner took
two days to cook.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.352
You animals ate it
in five minutes!

10:55.389 --> 10:57.188
What's for dessert, mom?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.340
Nothin'!

10:58.341 --> 10:59.491
I want you to sit there
for two days

10:59.493 --> 11:01.459
And think about
that dinner you just devoured,

11:01.461 --> 11:03.828
And then maybe
i'll give you a cupcake.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.465
Well, i thought it was
great, topanga.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.066
Thank you.
I don't get a lot
of home-cooked meals.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.201
How's the job going,
shawn?

11:10.203 --> 11:11.102
Oh, you do something?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.504
( chuckles )
yeah.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.472
I write for a site
called "hit the road."

11:14.474 --> 11:15.974
Go to a lot of
different places

11:15.976 --> 11:17.042
And tell you if
it's worth a weekend.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.877
I-- i go on that site.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.278
Restless little spirit,
huh?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.080
No, i just think about--

11:22.082 --> 11:23.982
- Other places?
- Sometimes.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.116
Yeah...

11:25.118 --> 11:27.085
Yeah...

11:27.087 --> 11:29.220
You take the pictures too.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.890
I do.
How'd you guess that?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.091
I draw pictures.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.592
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.529
I'm gonna say "yeah" last,
okay?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.264
Very mature.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.900
Yeah...

11:41.902 --> 11:43.234
( silently )

11:45.205 --> 11:47.872
Okay, that's it.
When's my birthday,
uncle shawn?

11:49.109 --> 11:50.508
He knows, riley.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.210
You keep on saying that.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.412
Why won't he answer?
What did i do?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.157
You're coming or what?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.198
December 8th.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.432
What?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.301
Your birthday?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.203
That doesn't save you.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.205
I know her birthday,
but i don't abandon my friends

12:20.207 --> 12:21.206
To hit the road.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.173
Whoa.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.475
You think that's fair?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.343
I do.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.178
Then this is fair too.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.147
What time was she born?

12:29.149 --> 12:30.281
How much did she weigh?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.416
How tall was she?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.185
Both: Uh-oh.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.321
6:00 in the morning,
seven pounds, four ounces,

12:36.323 --> 12:38.323
21 inches.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.225
I was there all night.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.360
I was the first person
to hold you after your parents.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.063
You looked like this.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.066
She still does.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.304
Why do you remember
it all so well?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.106
It was the day
i left new york city.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.175
City wasn't big enough
for the both of you?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.477
When people get married
and they have kids,

12:59.479 --> 13:01.379
Sometimes their old friends
who didn't keep up

13:01.381 --> 13:03.648
Start to feel a little
out of place.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.151
Please don't make me the reason
that you don't stick around.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.019
No, i'm the reason.
It's on me.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.388
Your parents
are the best people
i've ever met in my life.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.056
Then you should
really love riley.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.058
Because i love her.
I mean...

13:14.060 --> 13:15.960
She's exactly like
her parents.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.500
He does love me.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.669
What?

13:24.671 --> 13:27.572
He loves my parents
and i come from them,

13:27.574 --> 13:29.107
So he loves me.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.076
He loves me so much
that he can't even
look at me.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.978
I'm right here.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.419
Look at me.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.321
I'm looking at you.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.724
( deeply )
look at me...

13:48.261 --> 13:49.994
What?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.264
You're cory
with topanga's hair.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.201
You got lucky.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.203
( girls giggle )

13:58.205 --> 14:01.072
Is it okay if
i say something scary?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.142
I hardly think
a 13-year-old girl

14:04.144 --> 14:06.077
Can say anything
that would scare me.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.146
Every time you see me,

14:08.148 --> 14:10.348
Does it remind you
of what you don't have?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.016
Check!

14:16.656 --> 14:17.789
Get in there!

14:17.791 --> 14:20.191
Uh, riley,
you do not command

14:20.193 --> 14:21.192
A grown man.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.628
- You!
- Who, me?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.697
Both of you.
Go to my room.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.234
( sighs )

14:29.236 --> 14:32.203
This would never happen
on "the cory and shawn show."

14:35.742 --> 14:37.208
What does she
want from us?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.245
This is riley
and maya's spot.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.279
They just sit here?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.614
For hours.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.216
They just sit
and pour their hearts out.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.754
Tell him how you feel
right now.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.459
- I missed you, shawn.
- I missed you more.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.227
I missed you
something fierce.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.098
Boy, this window's
powerful.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.166
Wait--
wait a minute.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.902
She's got you trapped
in your own home?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.104
Oh, it's not just her.
It's all of them.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.172
You lost it, pal.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.340
Oh, yeah, good luck.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.508
Like that's gonna work.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.210
Ah...

15:12.212 --> 15:13.611
And you're back.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.382
Yeah yeah,
they might be
as good as us.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.751
Look, you, i know
when i'm being set up.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.153
I know when i'm in the middle
of somebody's scheme.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.623
Yeah, we were
the king of schemes.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.229
We were kings.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.232
Look at us,
shawnie.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.700
What's the scam,
little girl?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.336
Why did you really
move out of the city?

15:38.338 --> 15:41.372
Are you doing this
to keep me and cory together?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.574
'cause we're fine.
We don't need this.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.276
I know that.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.313
I have my eye on
a much bigger prize.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.418
Cor, don't take this
the wrong way,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.820
But your daughter's
a strange little bird.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.857
Shawn, why did you really
move out of the city?

15:59.859 --> 16:02.293
( deeply sighs )

16:02.295 --> 16:03.828
You were preoccupied
with your wife

16:03.830 --> 16:05.163
And your bird.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.132
I was not preoccupied.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.400
How long have
i been away?

16:09.402 --> 16:11.669
- Three weeks.
- 13 years.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.205
Cory, life changed

16:14.207 --> 16:15.273
When you had the kids.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.141
I don't know how
to be the cool uncle.

16:19.779 --> 16:20.962
<i>( door opens )</i>

16:20.963 --> 16:22.146
Oh.  Well, we interrupt
two grown men

16:22.148 --> 16:24.782
In a girl's bedroom window
for this special announcement.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.918
Mom says to come down
to open presents.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.821
We now return
to two grown men
in a girl's bedroom window.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.557
♪ they're two grown men ♪

16:32.559 --> 16:33.891
♪ in a girl's bedroom window ♪

16:33.893 --> 16:36.394
♪ and nobody thinks
that's weird. ♪

16:36.396 --> 16:37.495
A-wink.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.366
I would never
watch that show.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.338
See?
Cool uncle's
already taken.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.708
Ladies.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.247
Oh.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.182
Excuse me,
do i have the right house?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.519
Minkus?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.621
Yes.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.224
Cory, what's this here?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.725
( chuckles )

17:07.727 --> 17:10.528
Shawn, this is
farkle minkus.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.263
Get out of here!

17:12.265 --> 17:14.465
I'm stuart minkus' son.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.434
Minkus reproduced?!

17:18.271 --> 17:19.537
( laughs )
yeah.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.205
( laughs )
what do you think?

17:21.207 --> 17:24.208
He was cloned in
a lab or something?
( laughs )

17:24.210 --> 17:25.676
Look at him.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.450
Huh.

17:32.452 --> 17:36.587
Farkle, have you ever
actually seen your
birth certificate?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.656
Huh.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.477
If you'll excuse me,

17:42.478 --> 17:43.995
I have some questions
i need to take care of.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.299
Wow.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.001
I mean, even minkus?

17:52.972 --> 17:54.272
Hey, cor.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.607
Yeah?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.676
What's it like
to have children?

18:00.013 --> 18:03.815
Shawn, my life began
when i had riley.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.817
( exhales )

18:07.020 --> 18:09.887
Riley's right.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.023
I moved out of the city
because every time i came here

18:12.025 --> 18:14.859
It reminded me
of what i didn't have.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.964
Shawn, find someone.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.033
Begin your life.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.368
Thank you.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.937
You have served
your purpose.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.939
Wait.
What are you doing?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.807
Wait, what are
you doing?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.008
( sighs )

18:31.978 --> 18:34.479
Ask him
about his parents.

18:36.716 --> 18:37.949
Riley.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.352
Look at them.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.789
They're us.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.457
( exhales )

18:46.459 --> 18:47.925
( exhales )

18:47.927 --> 18:49.927
Come here.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.062
Was this your idea?

18:51.064 --> 18:53.064
What do you think?

18:53.066 --> 18:56.667
I think you are
the new king.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.071
Yeah.  Well, i did
learn from the best.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.106
Uh, cory?

19:02.108 --> 19:05.309
- What's going on?
- Riley, what are you
trying to do here?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.945
You got this, buddy.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.014
You got this, buddy.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.323
Okay, fine.
So, what about your parents?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.325
Okay, fine.
Um...

19:21.327 --> 19:23.828
My dad was in and out
half the time.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.830
I got half a mom.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.965
Well, my mom took off
when i was a kid.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.368
My dad has
another family.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.804
I would never let
anybody grow up like that.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.740
You wouldn't?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.008
No.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.910
Oh.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.646
You wouldn't?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.548
No.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.886
Oh.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.428
Topanga.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.731
We had an amazing
childhood together.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.368
But it's over now.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.003
It's better now.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.040
This family
you've given me...

20:10.743 --> 20:12.810
Topanga,
it's everything.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.480
Am i everything to you?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.584
My whole life.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.056
Aw, cory.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.758
There is no greater gift
than hearing you say that.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.727
What else could you
have possibly gotten me?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.063
A massage at the spa
and gift certificates

20:32.065 --> 20:33.864
For going out to dinner
all next week.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.866
Gimme gimme gimme
gimme gimme gimme
gimme.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.736
So, what did
you get me?

20:40.006 --> 20:41.439
Same thing!

20:44.978 --> 20:48.679
Good husband,
good father...

20:48.681 --> 20:49.814
Good son.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.881
Good for you.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.719
Thanks, dad.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.087
I had you
at your best.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.655
- Mm.
- No.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.157
No, i have him
at his best.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.759
( cory and alan chuckle )

21:01.761 --> 21:03.094
Surprise.

21:05.665 --> 21:09.000
So, listen,
i have an assignment
next weekend

21:09.002 --> 21:11.135
Up in columbia county,
upstate new york.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.570
It's beautiful up there.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.971
We're gonna miss you,
shawn.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.706
Well, maybe not.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.875
'cause i was thinking...

21:17.877 --> 21:20.578
Maybe you might
wanna come?

21:20.580 --> 21:21.946
All of us?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.148
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.784
You know...

21:26.786 --> 21:28.886
Here it comes.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.123
I never go anywhere
without my best friend.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.793
Yeah, that's not
a bad way to grow up.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.129
So...

21:38.131 --> 21:39.830
Maybe you would like
to invite maya?

21:40.833 --> 21:43.100
Oh, you mean her?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.604
Oh, what do you say, kid?

21:46.606 --> 21:47.605
You wanna come?

21:47.607 --> 21:49.940
Yeah.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.208
You're invited too.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.644
Cool.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.647
Oh, boy.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.116
( all chuckle softly )

22:02.322 --> 22:05.222
Riley, this is for you.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.492
- Your camera?
- <i> I got a few.</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:10.961
But i figured with maya
being good at drawing pictures,

22:10.963 --> 22:12.263
Maybe you'd be good
at taking them.

22:12.265 --> 22:14.865
Yeah, now you guys
can be inspired together.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.867
Yeah.
Good old friends

22:16.869 --> 22:19.003
Should never be apart
too long.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.104
New friends either.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.172
Yeah.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.141
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.078
Okay.
